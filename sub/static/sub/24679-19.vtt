00:01.201 --> 00:03.613
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.670 --> 00:06.082
the worst criminal offenders are pursued

00:06.139 --> 00:08.642
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.382
These are their stories.

00:12.746 --> 00:15.249
Five cats, Kate. You want them all?

00:15.349 --> 00:17.192
I promised Mrs. Batchelder.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.762
You're an angel.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.629
The firemen told me it
was her electric blanket.

00:22.089 --> 00:23.568
That's terrible.

00:24.057 --> 00:27.834
If you hear from her family could you give
them my number? I need to talk to them.

00:27.895 --> 00:28.999
Okay.

00:29.096 --> 00:31.406
Now, you take care it doesn't happen to you,

00:31.465 --> 00:33.502
dying alone like that, all pathetic.

(CAT MEOWING)

00:37.271 --> 00:40.343
She was such a sweet lady,
Mom, you would've liked her.

00:41.775 --> 00:44.051
Where's the rosemary and the lavender?

00:46.113 --> 00:49.151
Her son complained they were too pungent.

00:49.516 --> 00:51.928
They told me this would be semi-private.

00:51.985 --> 00:54.158
Oh, it's not that bad.

00:54.221 --> 00:58.795
Anyway, sweetheart, you cannot
keep 5 cats in your apartment.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.604
What man will want to come home to that?

01:02.796 --> 01:04.275
I have to get to work.

01:04.331 --> 01:05.742
I love you.

(WOMAN COUGHING)

01:08.969 --> 01:11.006
It's fine, sweetheart.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.552
You get used to it.

01:15.142 --> 01:17.748
A private room is very expensive.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.916
That's no problem. I can cover it.

01:20.380 --> 01:23.020
That's not what you told us
when your mother checked in.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.087
Things change. I want her moved today.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.501
ROGER: It's sterling silver.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.899
I'm really not supposed
to be doing this, but...

01:36.964 --> 01:38.136
This is it?

01:39.199 --> 01:42.112
I told you over the phone
not to get your hopes up.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.610
But she promised me.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.312
I'm sorry.

01:47.240 --> 01:50.050
I wish things had worked out
differently for you.

01:51.011 --> 01:52.149
Good luck.

01:55.082 --> 01:58.291
You'll have a check in 3
days. Just give me a chance.

I know I had more coming to me,

02:22.643 --> 02:25.954

02:51.905 --> 02:53.976
Oh, my God! Kate!

03:44.624 --> 03:46.501
EAMES: It looks stripped.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.803
Definitely something the building
inspector should've picked up on.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.776
We figure he's got at least a
dozen landlords paying him off.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.073
Nice sideline.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.872
What we need to know from you

03:55.936 --> 03:58.348
is did she fall because
the handrail gave way,

03:58.405 --> 04:01.079
or did she slip and
then grab the handrail?

04:01.141 --> 04:03.678
We'd love to hit the inspector
with a negligent homicide.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.485
We'll see what we can do.

04:08.181 --> 04:10.457
Well, can we make the task force's day?

04:10.517 --> 04:12.793
Well, it depends on what
she tells us, right?

04:12.853 --> 04:15.663
The notch on the handrail
is where she lost the tooth.

04:15.722 --> 04:18.293
The fingernails on her left hand are broken,

04:18.358 --> 04:21.031
probably from grabbing the railing.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.504
So she was coming down the
left-hand side when she tripped.

04:24.831 --> 04:27.334
Which is odd, seeing as she's right-handed.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.416
The gums on her left side

04:32.839 --> 04:35.149
recede more than the ones on the right.

04:35.475 --> 04:39.890
People brush more vigorously on the
opposite side of their dominant hand.

04:39.946 --> 04:43.223
So she would be coming down the
right side of the stairwell.

04:45.552 --> 04:48.089
Unless somebody pushed her off the landing.

04:52.759 --> 04:53.999

04:54.528 --> 04:56.769

it's microscopic cat dander

05:10.811 --> 05:12.916
I had a girlfriend, Lola. She had cats.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.720
You ate fur balls for her?

05:16.449 --> 05:18.986
Maybe she did it for her boyfriend.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.195
Birth control pills.

(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

05:24.691 --> 05:27.934
Hello? They told me you wanted to talk to me.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.065
I'm Mrs. Wing, the super.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.934
The young woman, Kate Finnoff.

05:32.999 --> 05:35.707
Yes. Everyone in the building loved her.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.544
EAMES: That include a boyfriend?

05:37.604 --> 05:39.811
Oh, I don't think she had one.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.115
Where did the cats come from?

05:42.175 --> 05:44.951
Helen Batchelder. She lived upstairs.

05:45.445 --> 05:47.391
She died in a fire last month.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.760
She had no family. Kate helped
her with her errands.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.658
Well, Mrs. Batchelder had a nice
way of showing her gratitude.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.167
It's engraved, "Helen".
It's a cigarette holder.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.897
Sterling silver. It's a
Dunhill. From the '30s.

06:03.430 --> 06:04.966
Something wrong, Mrs. Wing?

06:05.031 --> 06:07.705
I thought I saw that at Helen's,

06:07.767 --> 06:10.475
on her coffee table, the night she died.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.578
Was there a table lighter with it?

06:13.640 --> 06:15.278
GOREN: They usually came that way.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.514
I think so.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.456
Was Kate in her apartment that night?

06:19.512 --> 06:20.923
MRS. WING: Getting the cats.

06:20.981 --> 06:24.019
But I can't imagine she would just take it.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.495
It's not like her.

06:25.919 --> 06:29.696
Seems there were other things she was
doing that were out of character.

06:30.023 --> 06:33.835
Credit card bills. Her past
balances were under a thousand.

06:34.461 --> 06:36.839
Then last month, she maxed out.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.977
$2,000 in linens, flowers every day,

06:40.300 --> 06:43.440
$1,600 at Lorelei's. High-end nightgowns.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.080
Mrs. Wing,

06:49.409 --> 06:52.583
does Kate have a friend
or a relative in the hospital?

06:56.616 --> 06:58.755
ERIN: I've been here 3 months.

06:59.719 --> 07:02.757
She always tried to make it like home.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.294
Poor, sweet Katie.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.935
(SOBBING)

07:10.196 --> 07:13.234
The other ladies, have they
been here longer than you?

07:13.967 --> 07:15.207
- Them?
- GOREN: Yeah.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.611
Rookies.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.047
(GOREN CHUCKLES)

07:20.006 --> 07:22.213
I was just looking at your plants.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.251
They'd be better off in the sun.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.120
You know, since you have seniority here,

07:26.179 --> 07:28.625
why didn't you take the bed
nearest the window?

07:28.682 --> 07:29.888
I did.

07:30.817 --> 07:33.525
But they moved me to a
private room last month.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.864
Katie made a special
arrangement with the hospice.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.396
But then they put you back in here.

07:39.759 --> 07:42.569
I mean, did something happen
with the arrangement?

07:44.397 --> 07:47.105
Katie said there was a mix-up.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.714
Sounds like this girl's heart
was bigger than her pocketbook.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.720
(PHONE RINGING)
All right, thank you.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.347
Well, her pocketbook wasn't
doing so bad last Christmas.

07:59.412 --> 08:02.291
Her bank said that she cashed
a $10,000 bearer bond.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.623
A bearer bond?

08:04.284 --> 08:08.027
12%, probably issued in the late '70s.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.158
Maybe a relative?

08:09.222 --> 08:10.860
Her mother would have said something.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.803
Or the old lady with the
cats. Kate helped her.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.840
She could have given it to her
as a Christmas gift.

08:15.895 --> 08:18.398
Bonds are a little like potato chips.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.570
People don't usually buy just one.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.011
This old lady could've been
sitting on a stack of them.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.276
If Kate knew that,

08:25.338 --> 08:28.615
she might've thought she'd inherit
some cash to go with the cats.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.383
God knows she needed the money.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.890
This old lady, she died in a fire?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.820
An electrical fire.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.631
It's a statutory waiting period

08:41.855 --> 08:44.699
to make sure all her
outstanding debts are settled.

08:44.991 --> 08:48.598
- Now, if she'd had a will...
- But 6 weeks, man.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.235
I mean, this junk, I could care less,

08:51.931 --> 08:55.378
but the money, see, I could use the money now.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.780
Look, Craig,

09:01.374 --> 09:05.083
I'm really not supposed
to be doing this, but...

09:06.246 --> 09:07.850
But what?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.797
HENDERSON: The old gal
peed herself during the night.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.201
Shorted out the electric blanket.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.901
Did you find protective undergarments
or a plastic mattress cover?

09:23.997 --> 09:27.035
HENDERSON: No. Some people
forget, or they're careless.

09:29.302 --> 09:34.479
Well, look, these photos...
I see grab bars in her shower.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.382
She's got 4 locks on her front door,

09:36.443 --> 09:38.389
a flashlight on her nightstand.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.320
This woman wasn't careless.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.286
All I know is that her bed
was drenched with urine.

09:43.349 --> 09:45.920
Sure smells like it. Did you check the urine?

09:46.186 --> 09:47.688
Check it for what?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.627
DEAKINS: Testosterone?

09:49.689 --> 09:53.694
Testosterone levels are higher in women
who take the pill. Women like Kate.

09:55.795 --> 09:57.502
God, I hope she's wrong.

09:57.897 --> 10:00.844
Using urine to cover up
an arson. That's depraved.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.681
Yeah, but maybe worth the trouble.

10:04.437 --> 10:08.078
Mrs. Batchelder's bank sent over her records.

10:08.208 --> 10:11.985
She only had $33,000 in the bank,

10:13.079 --> 10:15.650
but in 1978,

10:15.982 --> 10:18.724
she used her husband's life insurance pay-out

10:18.785 --> 10:22.494
to buy $150,000 worth of bearer bonds.

10:22.655 --> 10:26.068
12% interest over 25 years, compounded,

10:26.126 --> 10:28.800
that's over two and a half million dollars.

10:29.662 --> 10:32.575
The lab found testosterone,
all right. Lots of it.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.168
The urine's from a male.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.975
Ms. Finnoff has an accomplice.

10:36.035 --> 10:40.745
Oh, I need the white pages for Ossining.

10:41.474 --> 10:45.286
There's a notation in Mrs.
Batchelder's bank file.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.958
Two days after she died,

10:48.748 --> 10:53.697
they got a balance inquiry
from a bank in Ossining.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.928
Here. Batchelder, Craig M.

10:59.526 --> 11:02.700
The super said Mrs. Batchelder
had no other family.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.502
But this guy crawled out of the woodwork

11:04.564 --> 11:07.101
two days after she died. What a coincidence.

11:10.770 --> 11:14.684
Listen, I was just, you know, I was
just doing some financial planning.

11:14.741 --> 11:15.811
(MUSIC PLAYING)

11:15.875 --> 11:17.411
How much you getting?

11:17.610 --> 11:19.089
$33 grand.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.956
And because she didn't have a
will, I gotta wait for it.

11:23.917 --> 11:25.191
Lighter fluid.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.697
You thinking of doing
a Jimi Hendrix on your guitar?

11:28.755 --> 11:31.497
(CHUCKLING)
No, it's for my lighter over there.

11:31.958 --> 11:35.735
That's a butane lighter.
It doesn't take lighter fluid.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.172
It takes gas.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.904
I'm gonna be exchanging it.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.741
You were gonna exchange it.

11:42.569 --> 11:45.482
All these years, you never
visited your Aunt Helen?

11:45.572 --> 11:47.677
I told you, I blanked out on her.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.554
Soup's burning.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.919
GOREN: You know what takes
lighter fluid, Craig?

11:53.980 --> 11:55.254
Old table lighters.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.885
You don't have one of those, do you?

11:56.950 --> 12:00.557
You know, like a sterling
silver table lighter?

12:02.355 --> 12:04.198
Where am I gonna get one of those?

12:04.257 --> 12:05.895
You have an Aunt Helen.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.130
Yeah.

12:07.193 --> 12:09.332
It comes in a set.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.442
There's a matching cigarette holder.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.172
Your aunt's name is engraved on it.

12:16.469 --> 12:20.474
Well, the lighter has your uncle's
name engraved on it. Right?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.076
Right. Yeah.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.486
Damn it!

12:27.580 --> 12:29.787
You know he told me he
wasn't gonna say anything.

12:29.849 --> 12:30.987
Who?

12:31.050 --> 12:32.358
The guy.

12:33.219 --> 12:35.028
The guy from the city office.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.398
The one taking care of my aunt's stuff.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.497
He said he wasn't supposed to do it, but...

12:39.559 --> 12:40.902
But he let you swipe it.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.598
It's mine anyway.

12:42.662 --> 12:44.835
You know? He said it's better I take it now.

12:44.897 --> 12:49.141
He said things this valuable have a way
of disappearing down at city storage.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.745
Yes. Yes, they do.

12:58.811 --> 12:59.846
That's ridiculous.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.518
If I let him take the lighter,
I deserve to be fired.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.562
Mrs. Batchelder's file,

13:05.184 --> 13:07.755
is it in your current basket over there?

13:09.155 --> 13:11.101
You know, she always does that with me.

13:11.157 --> 13:12.966
She'll say like, "Where's the sugar?",

13:13.026 --> 13:15.336
instead of, you know, just, "Pass the sugar."

13:15.395 --> 13:17.238
You know somebody like that?

13:17.930 --> 13:19.341
Yeah.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.874
Estates that don't have heirs,
what happens to them?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.277
Well, after all the assets are liquidated,

13:27.340 --> 13:29.251
the proceeds go into a trust account.

13:29.309 --> 13:33.451
You sell off the furnishings, the
stocks, the bearer bonds, right?

13:33.546 --> 13:35.116
Everything gets liquidated.

13:35.181 --> 13:39.288
It says here Mrs. Batchelder had a
safety deposit box. What was in it?

13:39.385 --> 13:40.693
Birth certificates.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.632
Husband's death certificate. Old photos.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.327
GOREN: No bearer bonds?

13:45.391 --> 13:46.631
ROGER: No. Just old papers.

13:46.693 --> 13:49.640
No, I just... The reason why I keep
harping on the bearer bonds...

13:49.696 --> 13:51.698
Do you have a medical condition?

13:53.666 --> 13:57.773
Because I see all these 24-hour
pharmacy phone numbers.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.774
It's my dad. He has a chronic condition.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.719
Diabetes, among other things.

14:04.744 --> 14:06.951
He lives with me. I take care of him.

14:08.314 --> 14:09.793
The bearer bonds.

14:10.149 --> 14:14.620
We think that Mrs. Batchelder gave one
to a young woman in her building.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.001
A Kate Finnoff.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.695
There might be others floating around.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.932
Not that I found.

14:21.994 --> 14:25.237
EAMES: Ms. Finnoff had something
else of Mrs. Batchelder's.

14:26.432 --> 14:27.911
A cigarette holder.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.710
It's a set, probably a wedding present.

14:31.070 --> 14:34.449
We can't figure out how
Ms. Finnoff came to have it.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.077
Maybe the old lady gave it to her.

14:36.142 --> 14:39.123
Why, and split them up? No.

14:41.514 --> 14:46.361
Anyway, we'd like to go over and
look at Mrs. Batchelder's locker.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.996
You know, try our luck
with those bearer bonds.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.592
Well, I can't go with you today,

14:51.657 --> 14:53.159
but I can arrange a time for you both...

14:53.226 --> 14:55.001
EAMES: We can go today.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.098
We'll let you know what turns up.

14:59.265 --> 15:00.403
This stuff is great.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.639
If Mrs. Batchelder had
any idea it would end up

15:02.702 --> 15:06.275
in her nephew's head-banger paradise,
she might've made out a will.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.709
You know, maybe she did.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.652
This is a family Bible.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.986
It's got baptisms, marriages, deaths,

15:14.747 --> 15:16.488
through 8 generations.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.594
And she kept it up to date.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.563
Something that she planned to pass on?

15:23.589 --> 15:25.535
Even to a head-banging nephew.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.963
Certificates of appreciation from
Bide-A-Wee, the animal charity.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.543
A cat lover like her would
have left them something.

15:35.001 --> 15:36.947
She would have had a will.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.710
GOREN: Yes, she would've.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.480
She might have had a lawyer prepare it.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.386
Maybe the same lawyer who took
care of her husband's estate

15:45.445 --> 15:46.924
25 years ago.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.162
All these lockers,

15:52.218 --> 15:53.959
they're filled with the belongings

15:54.020 --> 15:56.728
of people who died without a will?

15:57.056 --> 16:00.265
Yes, sir. They're tied up in
here until they get settled.

16:08.601 --> 16:10.046
(TV CHATTERING)

16:10.102 --> 16:11.638
Hey, Dad.

16:16.375 --> 16:19.549
What game is that? That Broadway Joe?

16:20.279 --> 16:22.759
They want me there an hour early tomorrow.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.960
They change the appointment?

16:25.017 --> 16:26.963
STAN: Well, I didn't change it.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.599
I'm not in control of these things, Roger.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.932
You always assume I'm the one
making things difficult.

16:33.025 --> 16:36.802
Okay, I'll work through lunch, leave early.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.071
Just meet me at the curb.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.805
Roger, I have a bad hip.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.709
I cannot wait at the curb
in the dead of winter.

16:46.105 --> 16:49.416
Maybe it's more convenient if I
took the bus over the bridge.

16:50.109 --> 16:53.750
Is that what you want, Roger? Me on a bus?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.117
What?

16:57.884 --> 17:01.263
Roger, is that what you want me to do?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.934
No, no.

17:09.328 --> 17:10.704
I'll pick you up,

17:11.364 --> 17:14.208
and I'll come upstairs and get you.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.592
It's Roger, and call me back.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.860
I need to clear out my inventory.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.604
I tracked down Mrs. Batchelder's
late lawyer's secretary.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.574
She remembers her having a will.

17:45.631 --> 17:48.669
She remembers it was filed with
the court after the lawyer died.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.580
And she remembers the old lady had a
stack of bearer bonds an inch thick.

17:52.638 --> 17:55.448
If the will was filed with the
court, there'd be a record, no?

17:55.508 --> 17:57.681
No. Coffman had access to those records,

17:57.743 --> 17:59.916
and he has access to a delete key.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.284
And when people die without a will,

18:03.349 --> 18:06.262
he becomes lord and master of their estate.

18:06.953 --> 18:08.899
And then he robs their graves.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.625
Graves he dug.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.272
I can't talk right now.
I'm in the middle of overtime.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.071
(TV CHATTERING)
At 2:00 in the afternoon?

18:19.131 --> 18:20.405
Where are they playing, Tokyo?

18:20.466 --> 18:22.810
Did I just hear them call
Johnny Unitas' number?

18:22.868 --> 18:24.848
Yeah, that's the '58 championships...

18:24.904 --> 18:29.250
Yeah, I know. Sudden death
overtime. My dad was at this game.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.686
You don't mind if I have a look, do you?

18:32.244 --> 18:34.155
You just move in, Mr. Coffman?

18:34.347 --> 18:37.453
No, 5 years ago. After my wife passed.

18:38.417 --> 18:41.398
It's a good son you have there,
letting you move in with him.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.492
I don't know how good. He
stuck you in the dining room.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.327
Well, that's because he was
still with Angie then.

18:47.393 --> 18:48.633
His ex-wife.

18:48.995 --> 18:50.099
(SIGHING)

18:50.162 --> 18:51.368
The Princess.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.376
No, my son takes good care of me.

18:53.432 --> 18:55.571
I bet you don't catch him here much.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.011
He knows he can't leave me here alone.

18:58.170 --> 19:01.242
Not with my health. Diabetes. My kidneys.

19:01.407 --> 19:02.818
He stays with me.

19:02.875 --> 19:05.822
(CHUCKLING)
Come on, Mr. Coffman, he's a single guy.

19:05.878 --> 19:09.917
I bet on weekends he has a little,
you know, love shack in the country.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.984
He has plenty of time for that after I'm gone.

19:12.051 --> 19:13.553
I think he's making time for it now.

19:13.619 --> 19:18.500
Isn't that why he has a lock on the door
here so you don't, you know, walk in on him?

19:18.557 --> 19:20.264
You know, you're awfully snoopy.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.999
A lot of people point that out.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.369
This isn't locked.

19:23.429 --> 19:24.669
Of course it is. It's always locked.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.710
No, no, no, look at the deadbolt.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.871
You can see the light coming through.

19:28.934 --> 19:32.643
Here, go ahead, look. Look, try. See?

19:34.273 --> 19:35.718
Look, I bet all this time

19:35.775 --> 19:39.313
you were dying to just have a
little peep in this room here.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.651
I don't care what he has in here.

19:41.814 --> 19:45.125
You see, this one here, I can't
tell if it's locked or not.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.291
Now, you can't go in there.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.094
GOREN: It's just clothes.

19:56.662 --> 20:00.269
There's dust on the floor
where boxes used to be.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.145
Big boxes.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.810
Your son move them recently?

20:08.874 --> 20:10.854
To a storage facility or somewhere else?

20:10.910 --> 20:12.548
No, there's no storage.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.847
I didn't see him move any boxes.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.157
Wait a minute, what is that?

20:22.221 --> 20:26.601
It's a side view mirror from a model car.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.036
Roger have kids?

20:28.160 --> 20:29.298
No.

20:29.995 --> 20:32.566
He did build models when he was a little boy.

20:32.732 --> 20:36.202
Used to spend all of his paper
route money on them. Big waste.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.677
I gotta get a glass of
juice. Let's go. Come on.

20:48.514 --> 20:51.688
You do dialysis, right, for your diabetes?

20:51.951 --> 20:53.453
Go to the hospital for that?

20:53.519 --> 20:55.829
4 times a week. Over in Queens.

20:56.255 --> 20:59.099
They hook you up for
what, like 3 hours or so?

20:59.692 --> 21:03.572
What does Roger do during that
time? Does he sit with you?

21:03.629 --> 21:05.302
No, I don't expect that.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.605
He goes to dinner close by the hospital.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.577
Buys me lottery tickets.

21:12.071 --> 21:15.109
You mean like these here? Lucky Kim's Grocery.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.483
I feel lucky already.

21:20.045 --> 21:21.854
WILLIE: Yeah, I've seen him before.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.951
He comes in a few times a week to buy tickets.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.086
But he never wins.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.188
Figures. Why does he keep coming back?

21:27.253 --> 21:28.891
Does he have a place around here?

21:28.954 --> 21:31.833
He says he's got a sick
relative over at the hospital.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.269
Does he ever buy anything else but tickets?

21:34.326 --> 21:37.535
Sandwiches, fruit. Last
month he bought light bulbs.

21:37.863 --> 21:39.308
What kind of light bulbs?

21:39.365 --> 21:40.673
Floodlights.

21:43.169 --> 21:44.705
Floodlights.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.686
Is there a storage place
nearby here somewhere?

21:50.743 --> 21:52.484
Like mini storage? No.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.617
But one street over there's
a guy that rents out space.

22:04.390 --> 22:06.666
GAYDOS: Not sure what he kept in here.

22:07.526 --> 22:09.665
Just that he cleared out last week.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.875
Motion sensors. Cameras.

22:14.934 --> 22:18.609
Probably on the web as well so he
can watch things on his computer.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.844
It's all disconnected now.

22:21.607 --> 22:23.109
Shammy cloth.

22:24.476 --> 22:26.387
Meguiars Wax. The good stuff.

22:26.478 --> 22:28.685
My dad used to use it on his Cutlass.

22:36.755 --> 22:40.760
6 sets of tire treads. 6 cars parked here.

22:46.599 --> 22:50.172
The design of this tread,

22:50.236 --> 22:53.274
It's simple. Like an old tire.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.615
Paint flakes.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.493
There's some more over there
near the front of the car.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.586
Looks like all the cars had them.

23:06.285 --> 23:09.494
And they're all clean underneath.

23:16.295 --> 23:17.740
The oil drip.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.472
There's...

23:21.533 --> 23:24.776
There's one spot under each car.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.918
These cars were never moved.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.157
He just...

23:37.149 --> 23:39.288
He just... He just sat in them,

23:40.452 --> 23:42.090
turned the wheel.

23:43.555 --> 23:45.125
Like some kid.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.410
What was the wheelbase on this one?

23:55.467 --> 23:57.276
108 inches.

23:57.803 --> 24:00.044
Ford Shelby GT500,

24:00.406 --> 24:02.283
'67 for sure.

24:02.341 --> 24:04.878
The guy's using original stock tires.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.855
I don't see any wear on them.

24:07.413 --> 24:08.687
Detective Alex.

24:09.214 --> 24:10.591
Down, boy.

24:10.683 --> 24:11.821
Lewis, thank you, man.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.921
- Sure, Bobby.
- You helped.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.631
Goodbye, Detective.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.126
Look at this.

24:23.629 --> 24:27.441
Okay, this is a '57 Bel Air, '66 Stingray,

24:27.499 --> 24:30.503
'64 Carrera, '68 Camaro

24:30.569 --> 24:34.449
and a '65 XKE, and a '67 Shelby.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.379
and they're all in mint condition,

24:37.676 --> 24:40.247
all with the original equipment.

24:42.081 --> 24:46.427
Over $1,000,000 of automotive masterpieces.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.759
All this for a hobby?

24:47.820 --> 24:51.962
Not just a hobby. A lifelong obsession.

24:52.024 --> 24:55.733
Here, this is a side view mirror

24:55.794 --> 24:59.298
from a model car which
matches the '57 Bel Air.

24:59.365 --> 25:00.901
When he was a boy,

25:01.800 --> 25:04.440
he made models of these cars.

25:04.536 --> 25:06.311
But now he's killing for the real ones?

25:06.372 --> 25:08.875
Maybe not. The ME reviewed all the deaths.

25:08.941 --> 25:11.251
Natural causes. No foul play.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.186
Except Mrs. Batchelder.

25:16.248 --> 25:20.094
Yes. And unlike her, none
of the others had wills.

25:22.888 --> 25:24.868
So Roger has a pattern.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.606
He waits for people to die without wills,

25:29.661 --> 25:33.131
with a modest estate, and
then he plunders them.

25:33.599 --> 25:37.638
He does this over and over, doing
nothing to attract attention.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.375
Until Mrs. Batchelder.

25:41.407 --> 25:43.444
She's the only one with the will.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.719
She's the only one that he killed.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.587
The only one with millions.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.520
Yeah. It must have been something urgent

25:51.283 --> 25:53.058
that he needed it for.

25:53.118 --> 25:57.760
He searched the records of wills
that are filed with the court,

25:57.823 --> 25:59.063
he found her.

25:59.124 --> 26:02.799
But, you know, she's got money,
she's old, she's alone.

26:02.861 --> 26:05.000
The analysis on the orange paint flakes,

26:05.064 --> 26:07.169
it's the same paint the city uses.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.181
Of course it is.

26:17.609 --> 26:20.317
Here's the cashier's check.
He made it out like you said.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.052
So, kiss them goodbye.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.938
Rog, the keys.

26:38.864 --> 26:40.605
Okay, let's move them out.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.004
He buys a pair at a time. As Christmas gifts.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.339
He says people really appreciate them.

27:13.599 --> 27:14.942
The Denver boot.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.172
Nobody's gonna steal your car,

27:16.235 --> 27:18.875
you got a couple of these
babies clamped on the wheels.

27:18.937 --> 27:20.280
How does our guy pay?

27:20.339 --> 27:23.183
Cash. He's bought 7 pairs.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.149
7? When did he buy the last one?

27:26.512 --> 27:28.116
A couple of weeks ago.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.825
7 pairs for 6 cars. He's getting another car.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.057
A two and a half million dollar car.

27:34.853 --> 27:37.265
That's why he went after Mrs. Batchelder.

27:37.456 --> 27:40.926
His need isn't just urgent, it's pathological.

27:42.628 --> 27:43.971
We checked the auction circuit.

27:44.029 --> 27:46.805
No car sold for over a million
in the last 6 months.

27:46.865 --> 27:48.936
Ditto for private sales of antique cars.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.309
A $2,500,000 car.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.349
That's a big jump for Mr. Coffman.

27:52.404 --> 27:55.578
Well, the car probably has a
special significance for him,

27:55.741 --> 27:58.620
a token of achievement or self-worth.

27:58.710 --> 28:02.658
Which is why he won't run
until it's delivered.

28:02.915 --> 28:06.453
Public Administrator's office uses
shippers to send stuff out of state...

28:06.518 --> 28:09.897
So he might use an existing
account to hide his car shipment.

28:09.955 --> 28:12.697
All legitimate invoices would
be for outbound shipments,

28:12.758 --> 28:16.399
so any inbound shipments,
that would be suspicious.

28:16.461 --> 28:18.407
Like this one. It's a container.

28:18.463 --> 28:22.001
Arriving at the Port of New Jersey.
It doesn't say what's inside.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.090
(SNIFFING)

29:11.617 --> 29:12.960
GOREN: Roger!

29:14.987 --> 29:16.193
Wow!

29:17.723 --> 29:21.603
It's a Ferrari. This is a 1962 Ferrari GTO.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.833
This is incredible. What, they made only...

29:23.895 --> 29:26.569
What, they made, like, 32 of these, right?

29:26.632 --> 29:30.444
What, the leather. You
could smell that leather.

29:32.804 --> 29:34.977
Have you ever sat in one of these?

29:35.741 --> 29:40.247
(STAMMERING)
No? I haven't, either. I think
I need to get inside.

29:40.646 --> 29:42.182
I think I need to get inside.

29:42.247 --> 29:44.022
- You can't!
- Yes, he can.

29:44.082 --> 29:46.358
(ENGINE REVVING)
Baby, baby, baby.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.561
I wish I could tell you how this feels.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.226
I can't do it in mixed
company, but I wish I could.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.464
EAMES: Roger, you're under arrest for murder.

29:55.327 --> 29:56.965
You have no idea.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.201
(ENGINE REVVING)

29:58.263 --> 30:00.140
You son of a bitch.

30:00.265 --> 30:01.642
You have no idea.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.941
Get out of my car.

30:04.002 --> 30:05.743
Get out of my car!

30:07.272 --> 30:09.115
(ENGINE REVVING)

30:17.115 --> 30:19.095
You have to come out, now.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.568
We have the urinalysis of the blanket.

30:26.658 --> 30:30.936
We have his name on the rental
lease. We have the Ferrari.

30:31.229 --> 30:36.042
And once the accountants untangle
your client's financial Gordian knot,

30:36.101 --> 30:37.603
we will have everything.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.410
I don't know who this guy Gordon is,

30:39.471 --> 30:41.473
but let me cut through the crap.

30:41.773 --> 30:44.447
My client was in Surrogate's
Court filing papers

30:44.509 --> 30:45.954
when Ms. Finnoff was killed.

30:46.011 --> 30:48.287
And this urinalysis, where's the Lipitor?

30:48.347 --> 30:50.725
My client takes Lipitor for his cholesterol.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.625
If it was his piss on that blanket,

30:52.684 --> 30:54.823
it would have shown up on the test.

30:55.187 --> 30:57.030
Well, there's still that little wet dream

30:57.089 --> 30:59.899
that he took delivery of this morning.

31:01.259 --> 31:03.967
A stolen car shipped from Marseilles?

31:04.062 --> 31:05.666
That would be under the jurisdiction

31:05.731 --> 31:07.768
of our good buddies, the French.

31:08.166 --> 31:11.613
As for this jurisdiction, he might
be guilty of receiving stolen goods.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.549
Just point him to a judge,
and he'll post bail.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.990
The smell of Italian leather.

31:25.784 --> 31:29.823
It's intoxicating. Have a smell, Roger?

31:33.458 --> 31:34.903
(DOOR OPENING)

31:41.099 --> 31:44.046
My assistant checked
with the Surrogate's Court.

31:44.803 --> 31:47.784
The time stamps on the
papers Mr. Coffman filed

31:47.873 --> 31:51.753
provide enough of an alibi to
impress an arraignment judge.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.152
We found the Ferrari.

31:54.212 --> 31:57.785
Receiving stolen property.
He'd make bail and vanish.

31:57.849 --> 32:00.386
No, I mean we found this Ferrari.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.065
These are the boxes from his warehouse?

32:04.456 --> 32:06.367
Anything of evidentiary value?

32:06.425 --> 32:09.065
He only kept things that had value to him.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.242
- It's a Chevy Bel Air.
- Whoa!

32:15.300 --> 32:17.780
It's the one missing the side view mirror.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.119
The Stingray.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.152
Whoa.

32:25.811 --> 32:27.848
XKE.

32:27.913 --> 32:30.120
Now, this is a car!

32:32.184 --> 32:33.788
And the Shelby.

32:35.253 --> 32:38.257
The detail is remarkable.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.402
There's no Ferrari, though.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.269
You two having a play date?

32:44.663 --> 32:47.542
The lab re-did the urinalysis.
No trace of Lipitor.

32:47.599 --> 32:50.341
And Roger's doctor confirmed
he takes the stuff.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.581
(SIGHING)

33:09.087 --> 33:11.761
There's one more playmate that we forgot.

33:13.758 --> 33:14.964
Right in here.

33:15.026 --> 33:18.803
All right, not so fast. I'm
72 years old. I've got a bad hip.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.172
What is he doing here?

33:20.232 --> 33:21.575
GOREN: He's here to help you, Roger.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.738
I've gotta get you out of this jam.

33:24.135 --> 33:26.342
Is there at least a chair here?

33:26.404 --> 33:28.111
Right here, Mr. Coffman.

33:30.308 --> 33:31.719
EAMES: Here we go.

33:33.378 --> 33:36.723
We believe Roger embezzled nearly $5,000,000

33:36.781 --> 33:38.385
from the estates of dead people.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.656
That's not true, Dad.

33:39.718 --> 33:42.460
We believe he used the money to
buy vintage cars like these.

33:42.521 --> 33:45.331
We're not saying that he killed these people.

33:45.490 --> 33:49.063
They died on their own. Well, most of them.

33:49.928 --> 33:53.967
But a few months ago he learned
that a car came on the market.

33:55.534 --> 33:59.072
A car that he desired more than anything.

33:59.838 --> 34:01.875
GOREN: He needed a lot of
money to buy that car,

34:01.940 --> 34:05.581
and he found it in the
estate of a lonely old lady.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.885
EAMES: Except this old lady was still alive.

34:07.946 --> 34:12.395
So your Roger set her on fire
in the middle of the night.

34:12.449 --> 34:16.420
And when her young friend raised
a stink, he killed her, too.

34:16.487 --> 34:20.697
My son's not a killer!
Come on, for just a car.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.568
Well, if they were only

34:26.130 --> 34:28.338
just cars.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.808
You know, Mr. Carver and I, we were admiring

34:33.871 --> 34:37.547
your workmanship and your detailing.

34:37.609 --> 34:40.886
Especially the undercarriage.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.293
How did you get this effect here?

34:45.417 --> 34:48.523
I weathered it using Rustall,

34:48.587 --> 34:50.623
baking soda and some white glue.

34:51.389 --> 34:54.529
It's great work. And the tire stems?

34:54.592 --> 34:57.904
Oh, I made a hole, using a .019 drill bit

34:57.963 --> 35:00.136
and a piece of black wire.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.245
And you said he was wasting his time.

35:03.301 --> 35:06.339
GOREN: Why did you stop model
building? Why would you stop that?

35:06.404 --> 35:08.247
I got other interests.

35:10.508 --> 35:12.488
That was around your...

35:13.111 --> 35:15.523
Your 12th birthday, wasn't it?

35:15.847 --> 35:18.691
All these dates on here are the same.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.253
February 19th, 1969.

35:22.587 --> 35:25.124
That's a couple of days after your birthday.

35:26.825 --> 35:31.069
That's when you put all these away.

35:33.031 --> 35:34.738
I really don't remember.

35:36.668 --> 35:40.548
GOREN: Well, I guess it just
slipped out of your memory.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.514
There's one missing.

35:43.575 --> 35:47.387
You know, the Ferrari. It's not in here.

35:49.214 --> 35:51.125
No. I never had that one.

35:54.252 --> 35:57.665
What about this one? You never had this one?

35:58.757 --> 36:00.668
You had this one, right?

36:00.725 --> 36:02.466
What, did you buy it
with your paper route money?

36:02.527 --> 36:04.097
I got that for him on his birthday.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.006
I bet he bugged you for months
for this model Ferrari.

36:07.065 --> 36:08.169
Oh, yeah.

36:08.233 --> 36:10.770
Had his little 12-year-old heart set on it.

36:13.238 --> 36:17.482
This one came painted already
with the decals already on it.

36:19.377 --> 36:22.790
Now, these here, how many pieces for each?

36:22.847 --> 36:24.451
50? 100?

36:24.516 --> 36:26.223
110.

36:27.419 --> 36:31.094
The more pieces, the more
intricate, the better it is.

36:31.156 --> 36:33.432
Right? I mean, that's the whole point.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.535
This one only has 10 pieces.

36:36.961 --> 36:40.636
See here, it says, "Snaps together
in 10 minutes. No glue required."

36:41.499 --> 36:45.037
But, I mean, it's a birthday
gift, you know, from your Dad.

36:46.805 --> 36:50.844
Still, I mean, slather on all the
Rustall and baking soda you want,

36:50.909 --> 36:53.719
it's still kind of a cheap knock-off.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.049
This is the only model of this car they had.

36:57.115 --> 37:00.790
No. No, no, no. That's not true.

37:02.487 --> 37:03.989
That's not true, is it, Roger?

37:04.055 --> 37:06.763
I mean, there were better models.

37:07.759 --> 37:08.965
Right?

37:09.160 --> 37:10.867
There were better models.

37:12.731 --> 37:16.304
He was just too preoccupied to find one.

37:16.534 --> 37:18.810
Too busy and preoccupied with his own life

37:18.870 --> 37:21.714
to realize that it would
make a difference to you.

37:21.840 --> 37:25.014
He probably picked this up, what, like,

37:25.076 --> 37:27.784
last minute on the way home from work.

37:30.448 --> 37:32.121
That hurt bad, huh?

37:33.084 --> 37:35.086
To realize that you're...

37:36.321 --> 37:39.165
you're just an afterthought
in your father's life.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.130
Sucked the fun right out of making models.

37:46.231 --> 37:47.835
That's when you put these away,

37:47.899 --> 37:50.140
and you moved on with your life.

37:53.138 --> 37:57.314
Huh? You got married. You
put all this stuff in the past.

37:57.842 --> 38:01.255
Until your Dad came and moved
in with you and your wife.

38:01.312 --> 38:03.724
The Princess. That's what he called her.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.763
- Oh, but I didn't mean it in a...
- ROGER: How could you?

38:07.318 --> 38:09.457
It was her idea to take you in.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.626
GOREN: And then he drove her away.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.962
Then what was left? Hmm?

38:15.560 --> 38:17.130
Just the two of you.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.104
You and him.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.848
And that's when, what?

38:29.507 --> 38:33.580
And that's when the clock
just rolled back to 1969.

38:34.445 --> 38:37.426
And you were that disappointed child again.

38:37.482 --> 38:41.430
That little 12-year-old with
the big hole in his heart.

38:42.420 --> 38:45.230
And you needed to fill it.

38:45.290 --> 38:48.430
But not with plastic cars, with real cars.

38:48.493 --> 38:52.066
So, what you did is you stuffed
all of your resentment

38:52.130 --> 38:56.408
and all of your hatred into that one task.

38:56.467 --> 38:57.571
No, no.

38:57.635 --> 39:00.548
It's not true. My son does not hate me.

39:00.605 --> 39:01.982
(GOREN LAUGHING)

39:02.540 --> 39:05.851
He doesn't hate you? He
implicated you in a murder.

39:06.611 --> 39:07.681
What?

39:07.745 --> 39:10.225
EAMES: You wear a catheter,
Mr. Coffman, with a bag?

39:10.281 --> 39:11.658
Yeah, so I'm a sick man.

39:11.716 --> 39:14.788
Well, thanks to your son's
helpful suggestion,

39:14.853 --> 39:18.300
we took another look at the urine used
in the murder of Mrs. Batchelder.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.802
We didn't find his anti-cholesterol medicine,

39:20.859 --> 39:23.965
but we found high levels
of protein and bacteria.

39:24.028 --> 39:27.669
Protein because diabetics dump
protein into their urine,

39:27.732 --> 39:29.769
while the bacteria's from the catheter.

39:29.834 --> 39:33.111
GOREN: Yeah, you see, that's
another thing we believe, Stan.

39:33.671 --> 39:36.515
That you supplied the urine
used to kill Mrs. Batchelder.

39:36.574 --> 39:40.112
You ungrateful little punk.
You mixed me up into this?

39:40.178 --> 39:43.250
You don't know what you're talking
about. He's just a senile old man.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.658
Senile? You, stealing from a poor girl

39:45.717 --> 39:48.994
who only wanted to take
care of her sick mother!

39:49.954 --> 39:53.458
You talked to her? Kate Finnoff?

39:56.628 --> 39:59.040
How else would you know about her mother?

40:02.901 --> 40:05.541
GOREN: The hospice called Kate,

40:05.603 --> 40:08.311
told her they were moving her
mother out of a private room.

40:08.373 --> 40:13.015
Kate was desperate for
money, so she called you.

40:14.012 --> 40:15.082
No.

40:15.146 --> 40:18.616
She tried you at your office,
but you were out all day.

40:19.317 --> 40:21.593
But you're in the phone book,
so she tried you at home,

40:21.653 --> 40:24.793
and you were there, 'cause
you're... you're always there.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.568
You talked to her a little bit, huh?

40:27.625 --> 40:31.163
She told you just enough so you'd
know what Roger had been up to.

40:31.796 --> 40:36.267
And then you panicked. You
panicked about Roger going to jail.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.674
But you panicked for yourself.

40:41.739 --> 40:43.047
You panicked about your own life.

40:43.107 --> 40:46.054
What's going to happen to me?
Who's gonna take care of me?

40:46.110 --> 40:48.249
- I don't want to be alone.
- I did no such thing.

40:48.313 --> 40:50.691
And so you dragged yourself
over to Kate's apartment.

40:50.748 --> 40:53.160
You talked to her just a little bit more.

40:53.718 --> 40:55.561
How'd you get her into the stairwell?

40:55.620 --> 40:57.622
Did you tell her you needed help?

40:58.623 --> 41:01.001
Did you tell her that you had a bad hip?

41:01.559 --> 41:03.561
And then you shoved her.

41:03.628 --> 41:06.575
I don't have to listen to any
more of this. I'm going home.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.668
We can prove it, Stan.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.338
See how you have your hand on the wall there,

41:12.403 --> 41:14.212
to steady yourself.

41:15.940 --> 41:18.420
We will find your prints in her building.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.215
I'm a sick man. I'm going home.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.691
Do you believe this guy, Roger?

41:24.349 --> 41:26.955
He's taken everything away from you.

41:27.018 --> 41:29.089
First it was the model cars.

41:29.153 --> 41:32.965
And then your wife, who loved you.

41:33.291 --> 41:37.831
He's taken everything that ever
mattered to you away from you.

41:37.895 --> 41:41.638
And just when you had it
right in front of you.

41:43.167 --> 41:46.376
Well, if he hadn't killed Kate Finnoff,

41:48.606 --> 41:50.813
we might not have gotten on to you.

41:52.577 --> 41:56.081
You'd be riding this Ferrari
right out into the sunset.

41:57.181 --> 42:00.094
Instead of a prison bus into a hellhole.

42:00.485 --> 42:02.829
You stupid old man.

42:04.322 --> 42:08.395
You stupid, stupid selfish old man.

42:09.794 --> 42:12.673
You wrecked everything.

42:12.730 --> 42:16.007
My marriage, my birthday.

42:16.801 --> 42:18.337
You always wreck everything!

42:18.403 --> 42:20.474
Wreck what? I gave you what you wanted.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.449
How do you know what I wanted?

42:23.941 --> 42:25.943
I never mattered to you.

42:28.913 --> 42:30.221
Never!

42:31.783 --> 42:34.127
Get away from me! Get away from me!

42:34.185 --> 42:36.392
You never cared! You never, ever cared!

42:36.454 --> 42:38.934
What about me, huh? What about me?

42:38.990 --> 42:40.799
When do I get a little consideration?

42:40.858 --> 42:43.930
Right now, Mr. Coffman, you
are under arrest for murder.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.870
STAN: What?

42:48.766 --> 42:52.145
Look what you've done to me. You dumb punk!

42:52.203 --> 42:54.205
You see? You see what he's like?

42:54.272 --> 42:55.945
- Yes.
- You see?
- Yes, I see.

42:59.610 --> 43:00.918
(SIGHING)

43:06.617 --> 43:08.324
What did Clarence Darrow say?

43:08.386 --> 43:11.458
"The first half of our lives
are ruined by our parents,

43:11.522 --> 43:13.627
"the second half by our children."

43:15.693 --> 43:17.331
Only if you let them.

43:18.305 --> 43:24.678
