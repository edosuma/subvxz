WEBVTT

01:04.520 --> 01:09.310
I see you're going through
something there.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.277
I mean, you gotta be, right?

01:11.440 --> 01:14.568
You took my van.

01:14.650 --> 01:16.982
Looking for some people?

01:17.200 --> 01:20.408
- What'd they do to you?
- Al.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.085
He's not talking.
So, maybe we can leave it be, huh?

01:30.500 --> 01:32.206
Look, I'm really just trying to help.

01:45.770 --> 01:47.260
Where is this turnoff?

01:47.520 --> 01:51.263
We should've reached it by now.

01:51.940 --> 01:55.148
Did she tell us the right way?

01:55.690 --> 02:00.309
Yeah, I did. Just not all of it.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.907
I don't think
you understand the situation here.

02:04.370 --> 02:09.160
- Al, it's not worth it.
- No, this is gonna go our way.

02:09.330 --> 02:12.629
You have something I want. Your story.

02:12.710 --> 02:14.871
And I have something you want.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.713
Where I found that flag.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.928
But I'm not gonna let you take my van.

02:20.090 --> 02:21.967
And I'm not gonna let you
threaten us anymore.

02:22.050 --> 02:24.427
Well, this is how it's gonna be!

02:26.390 --> 02:28.472
You know how many times
I've been zip-tied?

02:28.560 --> 02:29.595
What?

02:31.360 --> 02:32.850
- Drop it! Drop it!
- Easy! Easy!

02:33.110 --> 02:33.974
Nick!

02:34.190 --> 02:35.680
Drop it!

02:35.990 --> 02:36.854
Drop it.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.105
- Drop it.
- Hey. Hey.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.407
Don't move. Pull over.

02:45.700 --> 02:46.906
Don't, Lucy. I'm fine.

02:47.000 --> 02:47.989
Listen to her.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.320
Let's just take a pause.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.819
Doesn't have to be anything
more than this.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.161
Come to a stop.
Take your hands off the wheel.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.296
Don't do it, Lucy.

02:54.460 --> 02:55.540
Luciana.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.422
Change of plans. Keep driving. Go around.

03:05.430 --> 03:06.306
Hey, hey.

03:13.730 --> 03:14.856
No!

04:55.620 --> 04:57.838
You okay?

05:02.130 --> 05:03.586
I'm going on a run.

05:09.260 --> 05:11.842
I'm coming with you.

05:13.850 --> 05:16.478
You sure?

05:16.560 --> 05:21.020
You're looking for food. I want to help.

05:21.150 --> 05:24.642
I should help.

05:37.710 --> 05:39.587
Wait, wait. Stop, stop!

05:39.670 --> 05:41.080
Whoa, whoa.

05:42.630 --> 05:46.373
Yeah, Al, forget it.
You're just digging a ditch.

05:54.810 --> 05:57.938
Well, if she needs a tow,
we gotta get her one.

05:58.020 --> 05:59.305
We?

05:59.400 --> 06:02.608
Yeah. We got it in this ditch.
We gotta get it out.

06:02.690 --> 06:03.600
And then?

06:03.690 --> 06:06.443
And then we talk about
whatever it is we have to talk about.

06:06.530 --> 06:09.738
Your story. Where I found the flag.

06:09.820 --> 06:13.369
Or not. Or you can just go on your way.

06:16.830 --> 06:19.572
I saw some trucks
at a serVIce yard a while back.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.370
We could use one to tow it out.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.125
How far back?

06:29.720 --> 06:31.290
Untie us first.

06:31.470 --> 06:35.634
The start of a negotiation
often requires an act of faith.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.842
You think we can trust them?

06:40.940 --> 06:43.568
Probably not.

06:45.780 --> 06:49.409
Okay. Okay.

07:16.430 --> 07:19.172
Come on, up. Up.

07:21.850 --> 07:23.647
- What the hell?
- No.

07:25.270 --> 07:28.819
This way, maybe you'll come back.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.903
And you won't do anything crazy.

07:31.990 --> 07:33.651
Again.

07:37.370 --> 07:38.359
You okay?

07:40.870 --> 07:45.125
I'll stay here with him.
I'm only gonna slow you down.

07:49.420 --> 07:51.752
You gonna be here when we get back?

07:52.590 --> 07:55.343
If I'm not, something went wrong.

07:55.510 --> 07:56.465
Well, we should get a move on

07:56.560 --> 07:59.097
if we want to get this truck out
before dark.

07:59.180 --> 08:00.886
You be careful with him. He's squirrelly.

08:03.730 --> 08:05.607
Come on.

08:17.080 --> 08:20.402
We won't be long.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.038
- Make sure she comes back.
- I will.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.395
What are you reading?

08:55.280 --> 08:58.192
Hey, you mind getting me something to eat
from my pack?

09:19.140 --> 09:22.098
Now, you can get it yourself.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.550
Aren't you worried I'm just gonna--

09:38.700 --> 09:40.076
I'm not worried.

09:58.550 --> 10:00.632
I got a protein bar.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.056
Do you like peanut butter?

10:08.100 --> 10:09.931
I do.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.332
Thanks.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.006
I'm Nick.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.008
Going up by the road, Nick.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.307
You move more than five feet
from this truck--

10:45.390 --> 10:47.676
Yeah, I get it.

11:42.820 --> 11:46.483
/V0, nobody. I talk to myself a lot.

11:49.410 --> 11:52.208
Morgan Jones.

11:52.290 --> 11:53.450
Where do you come from?

11:54.460 --> 11:58.044
Atlanta, ano; um...

11:58.130 --> 11:59.370
Then l/Irg/n/a.

12:23.780 --> 12:29.320
I lose people, and then I lose myself.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.126
Get down.

12:37.670 --> 12:38.910
Just stay down.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.796
What is it?

13:04.200 --> 13:05.736
Hey, wait!

13:23.170 --> 13:24.580
Hey, toss me my stick!

13:25.380 --> 13:28.178
Hey! Hey!

13:54.370 --> 13:55.951
The sound draw more of them?

13:56.040 --> 13:59.703
It's not that loud.
If it does, more for me to kill.

14:03.840 --> 14:07.424
There. The cables. That one will work.

14:07.510 --> 14:11.253
Okay, I'll try to get it started.
You can check the rest for gas.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.511
Maybe we can put a bow
on this thing by sundown.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.342
Then we can get back
to looking for Laura, yeah?

14:40.420 --> 14:44.163
So, your mission is one of benevolence?

14:45.420 --> 14:47.160
- Benevolence?
- Yeah.

14:47.260 --> 14:50.297
We're alive after _
our rather aggressrve Introduction.

14:50.430 --> 14:52.967
This is an inconvenient kind of danger
you're putting yourself into.

14:53.050 --> 14:55.052
- You're doing it for a reason.
- Yeah.

14:55.180 --> 14:56.920
I need you guys to clean up
the mess you made.

14:57.020 --> 15:00.592
And you want something beyond that.
Our story.

15:00.690 --> 15:01.896
That's right.

15:01.980 --> 15:04.062
For who?

15:06.230 --> 15:08.448
We don't know how all this ends.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.941
The story might be
the only thing that's left.

15:11.030 --> 15:13.942
And who cares?
There won't be anyone around to watch it.

15:14.030 --> 15:16.908
_ It doesn't matter.
It just matters that It's captured.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.457
Why, Al?

15:28.050 --> 15:32.168
What happened to your hand?
Why do you try to hide it?

15:34.050 --> 15:36.632
Let's stay on topic. Why, Al?

15:40.140 --> 15:44.429
Because the truth matters.
Even if it's just heard out loud.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.186
Even if it's just heard once.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.987
By you?

15:50.070 --> 15:51.810
Yeah.

15:51.910 --> 15:56.609
By me. 'Cause that's the trade.

15:56.700 --> 16:00.488
The truth about you, your story
for where I found the flag.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.162
- They're just words.
- The truth isn't about words.

16:04.330 --> 16:08.539
It's about what really happened,
and what's happening, now.

16:09.590 --> 16:11.126
You're a puzzling creature.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.756
I have no idea how she's alive.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.092
- Oh, I think you do.
- I do.

16:19.980 --> 16:24.849
She knows her shit.
Except for that shit about the truth.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.858
We shall continue to consider your offer.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.446
Or not.

17:50.440 --> 17:51.475
Hey.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.850
Good luck out there.

17:55.950 --> 17:59.522
Pretty slim pickings
unless you know where to look.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.735
We'll manage.

18:01.660 --> 18:05.118
Good to see you back on the horse, Nick.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.166
Wait, wait, wait. Uh... Here.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.628
You should give this back
to your girlfriend.

18:11.710 --> 18:15.123
Figured you knew Charlie
didn't really like children's books.

18:23.220 --> 18:26.223
We never stood a chance, did we?

18:26.310 --> 18:30.269
She was never gonna stay with us,
didn't matter what we did.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.561
We'll get her back.

18:34.360 --> 18:39.195
How do you do it?
How do you come out here?

18:39.320 --> 18:40.810
Here's my trick.

18:40.910 --> 18:46.189
Wherever I go,
I try to look for something good.

18:46.330 --> 18:51.700
You know, it could be an old billboard
with a stupid pun to sell ravioli.

18:51.790 --> 18:55.339
Could be an armadillo.
Could be some piece of evidence

18:55.420 --> 18:59.754
that people were actually
helping each other.

18:59.880 --> 19:04.749
A sign, I don't know. Something good.

19:04.930 --> 19:09.299
It's out here. I always see something.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.009
Thanks.

19:58.150 --> 20:01.483
That horn's calling all the walkers
out of these woods.

20:01.570 --> 20:03.652
We need to find some place safe.

20:30.640 --> 20:34.349
They're gonna wonder what happened to us
when they come back.

20:34.440 --> 20:38.774
They'll hear what happened,
and then they'll see it.

20:41.570 --> 20:44.277
They'll find us.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.456
Can you take her?

21:04.090 --> 21:05.216
God!

21:17.730 --> 21:19.891
- We're clear, now.
- You okay, man?

21:21.820 --> 21:23.856
We can hole up in here.

21:25.910 --> 21:29.698
Hey, why'd you help me?

21:29.780 --> 21:32.283
'Cause I'd have let them
rip me apart back there.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.247
I don't kill.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.041
You at the church, Maddie?

21:43.130 --> 21:44.370
Just getting here.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.540
I hope you do better than we did.

21:46.630 --> 21:49.849
We'll let you know.
We're 0 for 8 so far.

21:52.970 --> 21:54.346
Make that 0 for 9.

22:01.520 --> 22:04.182
Come on, let's keep looking.

22:08.780 --> 22:10.611
Hey, Turnip Man.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.743
- Any luck out here?
- Are you following us?

22:14.080 --> 22:17.572
Seems to me like we were here first.
Ought to get yourself a faster car.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.201
You think this is funny?

22:23.760 --> 22:25.967
I'm not laughing.

22:28.090 --> 22:29.136
Mm.

22:29.760 --> 22:33.924
Nick? Maddie, you copy?

22:34.020 --> 22:36.090
How’s it going?
Do they have a soup kitchen?

22:45.320 --> 22:47.197
Like my brother told you,

22:47.280 --> 22:49.350
she's got a knack
for finding the good stuff.

22:49.450 --> 22:51.065
You know how much condensed milk
we found in there?

22:51.160 --> 22:52.696
You don't have to listen to him, Charlie.

22:52.780 --> 22:54.236
She wants to.

22:54.330 --> 22:55.866
That true, Charlie?

22:56.830 --> 23:00.994
You spent two weeks with her.
I'm the one who found her.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.036
I'm the one who taught her
how to make it out here.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.792
Nick, come on. Let's go.

23:07.510 --> 23:09.466
Let's go, Nick, come on.
Now's not the time.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.057
Whatever.

23:14.140 --> 23:17.519
And unlike you, I keep my family fed.

23:19.020 --> 23:20.226
Nick!

23:22.520 --> 23:23.555
Go inside.

23:25.270 --> 23:26.726
Stop.

23:27.780 --> 23:29.520
Stop.

23:29.650 --> 23:31.948
Stop.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.658
Let's get out of here.

24:11.820 --> 24:12.855
God.

24:12.950 --> 24:15.612
- You want a hand with that?
- I got It.

24:17.700 --> 24:21.739
- You sure? It's the least I can do.
- I got It.

24:21.830 --> 24:25.072
Probably lay off the karate
till it's healed.

24:25.170 --> 24:27.206
And you ought to stop
getting yourself into trouble.

24:27.960 --> 24:29.416
And it's not karate.

24:29.510 --> 24:32.081
- What is it, then?
- It's...

24:35.850 --> 24:37.886
It's just not karate.

24:41.270 --> 24:42.510
Well, it's going to be getting dark soon.

24:42.600 --> 24:46.479
We should probably find you a car,
so, you can be getting back.

24:48.150 --> 24:50.687
You mean that El Camino?

24:52.860 --> 24:56.899
Still looking for it, right?

24:56.990 --> 25:00.153
- Are you gonna try and talk me out of it?
- No.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.998
But it is not gonna work out
how you think.

25:04.080 --> 25:06.412
- You don't know what he did to me.
- It doesn't matter what he did to you.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.377
It's still not gonna work out
how you think.

25:08.460 --> 25:11.588
Right, because you don't kill, yeah?
But I bet you did.

25:11.710 --> 25:12.711
Huh.

25:15.340 --> 25:19.595
Why'd you stop? Huh?

25:19.930 --> 25:21.921
- Who did you lose?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.261
Yes, you do. You lose people,
and you lose yourself.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.341
I saw the tape.
I heard everything you said.

25:27.650 --> 25:28.685
You should just leave it.

25:28.770 --> 25:30.476
Why does it matter? Why not just tell me?

25:30.570 --> 25:32.390
- Oh, I'm not doing this.
- Not doing what?

25:32.490 --> 25:35.812
This. Telling you my life. Telling...

25:45.620 --> 25:50.626
You wanna hunt down whoever hurt you,
that's your business.

25:59.890 --> 26:01.175
- Nick!
- Luce, stop!

26:01.260 --> 26:02.136
Morgan!

26:02.390 --> 26:04.472
- Nick!
- Wait!

26:04.770 --> 26:07.091
Look. They went this way.

26:10.190 --> 26:11.100
See?

26:16.070 --> 26:17.196
We're not leaving.

26:19.990 --> 26:22.322
We'll come back for the van, Al.

26:22.410 --> 26:25.573
When the battery's died down,
and the passed has wandered off.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.867
No. No, I'm not leaving.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.451
Which means you don't find out
where the flag came from.

26:31.540 --> 26:32.746
Least not from me.

26:33.710 --> 26:37.294
Morgan's not gonna get far on that leg.
He might need us.

26:39.220 --> 26:43.714
Fine. You go. I'm not leaving.

26:43.850 --> 26:45.761
It's just a van, Al!

26:45.850 --> 26:48.808
Yeah, well, I got some things in that van.

26:50.940 --> 26:54.649
Go. I'll be fine.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.401
We'll do it!

27:00.950 --> 27:03.191
We'll get the van out now!

27:04.740 --> 27:07.994
A deal requires an act of faith.
This is ours.

27:08.250 --> 27:09.786
What about Nick?

27:10.500 --> 27:12.877
You go look for him!

27:13.840 --> 27:18.129
You really think we'd try anything
with two of our people out there?

27:27.270 --> 27:29.477
Your turn.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.899
We do this, you don't just tell us
where you found the flag,

27:34.980 --> 27:37.357
you take us there.
Then you help us find these people.

27:37.780 --> 27:39.691
We talk, you drive.

27:40.030 --> 27:43.989
All of it, all the way, until the end.

27:47.450 --> 27:50.283
You'll answer all of my questions.

27:50.370 --> 27:54.625
And you'll let me film you
doing what you do.

27:59.380 --> 28:01.291
Deal.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.479
Hey!

28:29.450 --> 28:31.577
Hey!

28:32.750 --> 28:33.819
Hey!

28:35.080 --> 28:37.036
Hey!

29:26.260 --> 29:27.500
Pull her up!

30:31.580 --> 30:33.696
Keep walking, old man.

30:35.750 --> 30:38.366
There's nothing for you here.

30:53.510 --> 30:56.343
You need to leave.

30:56.480 --> 30:59.267
Oh, yeah? Is that right?

30:59.350 --> 31:01.147
Get in your car and go.

31:01.230 --> 31:03.221
Or, what?

31:09.360 --> 31:10.236
Go.

31:15.910 --> 31:17.650
Holy shit.

31:20.830 --> 31:22.161
I didn't think I'd see you again.

31:23.880 --> 31:29.159
Walk away. I said walk away!

31:30.970 --> 31:34.349
You should listen to your friend.

31:34.430 --> 31:35.886
It's good to see you, Nick.

31:38.180 --> 31:42.059
But I, uh, gotta
get these pimentos unloaded.

31:42.230 --> 31:43.549
Unless you wanna give me a hand?

31:43.940 --> 31:45.567
Don't.

31:45.940 --> 31:48.773
Don't.

31:51.860 --> 31:54.579
Are you gonna do
what it takes to stop me? Huh?

31:55.990 --> 31:57.150
Huh?

31:58.870 --> 32:01.862
You can. You did.

32:09.970 --> 32:11.961
Didn't think so.

32:17.640 --> 32:20.803
She saw me. She was standing right there.
She saw everything.

32:20.890 --> 32:23.393
- You didn't do anything, Nick.
- I would've if you hadn't stopped me,

32:23.480 --> 32:24.469
and she saw that.

32:24.560 --> 32:26.812
You were trying to help,
trying to get food for us.

32:28.530 --> 32:30.942
You try to do the right thing,
you end up doing the worst.

32:31.030 --> 32:33.692
That's why I stayed inside so long.
It's not because of what's out here,

32:33.780 --> 32:37.238
_ it's because of what
beIng out here does to you.

32:37.370 --> 32:41.864
Being out here makes me feel more trapped
than being in there.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.835
Like who I'll be is just closing in on me,
just suffocating me.

34:12.170 --> 34:15.503
Wait. Wait, wait.

34:39.070 --> 34:43.404
Well, looks like they're winning.
This is some stick-based trauma here.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.997
Come on.

34:50.540 --> 34:54.044
You think he was worried
you wouldn't be coming back?

34:54.130 --> 34:56.291
Not my business.

35:02.260 --> 35:03.340
Sorry.

35:08.100 --> 35:12.013
Don't worry about it.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.897
I haven't been around people
in a long time.

35:14.980 --> 35:18.234
I'm gonna talk to you, so, I don't start
talking to myself again, all right?

35:18.320 --> 35:22.359
Why was he worried you wouldn't come back?

35:22.450 --> 35:25.283
'Cause one time, I didn't.

35:35.630 --> 35:39.714
When you left,
was it 'cause you didn't love him?

35:42.300 --> 35:47.169
I left, but I still loved him.

36:16.960 --> 36:19.508
What do you want?

36:30.640 --> 36:33.268
So, to answer your question,
it was my wife,

36:33.350 --> 36:36.319
my son, and my friends.

36:38.530 --> 36:42.523
That's who I lost, before I lost myself.

36:45.990 --> 36:47.617
I know where you are, Nick.

36:48.410 --> 36:51.709
'Cause I was there.

36:51.830 --> 36:54.321
I didn't know how to make it stop.

36:54.420 --> 36:57.662
I didn't know if I wanted it to stop.

36:58.840 --> 37:02.958
I just didn't think
I could ever find my way out.

37:06.220 --> 37:09.929
Then I met someone.

37:10.020 --> 37:13.342
Man didn't have to help me,
but he did. He...

37:13.440 --> 37:16.898
He gave me something, Nick.
He, he, he told me...

37:19.860 --> 37:22.852
He showed me that all life is precious.

37:22.950 --> 37:27.649
And that helped. It still does.

37:32.870 --> 37:37.159
Okay, how exactly?

37:40.880 --> 37:41.869
Yeah.

37:48.970 --> 37:54.260
This is part of it.
You wanted to know what I was reading.

37:59.650 --> 38:00.810
Too late.

38:01.280 --> 38:05.102
Believe me... Believe me, it's not.

38:07.700 --> 38:10.328
Here. We can talk about it.

38:11.540 --> 38:14.282
Talk about anything, Nick.

39:03.050 --> 39:05.086
Where is he?

39:05.170 --> 39:07.161
Around the side.

40:16.540 --> 40:17.734
Nick.

40:27.840 --> 40:30.126
Bluebonnets.

40:38.680 --> 40:42.184
Told you there was still good out here.

41:22.100 --> 41:23.226
Charlie.

41:42.910 --> 41:43.865
- Nick?
- No.

41:43.960 --> 41:44.824
Nick.

41:45.460 --> 41:47.121
Hey!

41:59.350 --> 42:01.090
- Come on, Nick.
- Hold on.

42:01.180 --> 42:02.590
Hold on, hold on, hold on, Nick.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.762
- Nick? Nick?
- Hold on.

42:04.850 --> 42:07.762
- Come on, buddy.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. Nick, look at me.

42:07.850 --> 42:09.147
- Look at me.
- Come on.

42:09.230 --> 42:11.312
Hey, look at me. It's gonna be okay.

42:16.450 --> 42:21.365
Hey. No, no, no, Nick.
Look at me. It's gonna be fine.

42:21.830 --> 42:24.151
- Come on. Come on, Nick.
- Nick.

42:24.330 --> 42:27.572
Hey. Nick, it's okay.

42:27.670 --> 42:29.661
- Hey.
- Come on.

42:37.380 --> 42:39.291
- Hold on.
- Nick.

42:39.390 --> 42:42.211
No, no.

42:42.350 --> 42:43.260
Nick, it's okay!

42:46.640 --> 42:50.679
No, no, no, no.
Nick, it's going to be okay.

42:53.020 --> 42:55.181
Nick?

43:51.290 --> 43:53.838
Nick.
