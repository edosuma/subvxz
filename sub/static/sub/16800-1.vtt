WEBVTT

00:03.560 --> 00:05.710
Can I get everyone's attention?

00:07.720 --> 00:09.590
Mr. Williams, please rise.

00:10.840 --> 00:13.031
Please raise your right hand, sir.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.030
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony

00:15.160 --> 00:18.790
you're about to give is the truth,
the whole truth

00:18.880 --> 00:20.678
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

00:20.760 --> 00:21.876
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

00:22.040 --> 00:23.315
Please, be seated.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.839
Mr. Williams, can you please give us

00:28.920 --> 00:32.118
your best recollection of the event
on the Deepwater Horizon?

00:34.920 --> 00:38.231
I was on the phone
around 9:30 with my wife.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.277
That's when I heard the hissing noise.

00:42.400 --> 00:44.278
I hear the engines start to rev.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.360
The hissing turned into a full-blown roar.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.397
Higher than I can even describe it.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.120
And within seconds,
there was a huge explosion.

00:54.120 --> 00:58.114
Projectiles comin' from everywhere.
The heat was overwhelming.

01:00.640 --> 01:04.992
Can you please explain to me how the
Deepwater Horizon's alarm system is set up?

01:06.080 --> 01:11.312
The general alarm is set up to inform
the entire rig of, number one, fire,

01:11.400 --> 01:14.871
number two, combustible gas,
number three, toxic gas.

01:14.960 --> 01:19.432
Each condition has a distinct tone
and a distinct visual light.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.031
On the evening of April 20th, did you hear

01:23.120 --> 01:25.919
any one of those alarms
on the Deepwater Horizon?

01:26.000 --> 01:26.990
No, sir.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.239
Do you know why
you never heard that alarm, sir?

01:33.960 --> 01:35.553
Mr. Williams?

01:35.640 --> 01:37.313
Mr. Williams!

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:17.920 --> 02:20.594
Passing through 3,000 feet.

02:31.440 --> 02:33.033
Continuing down.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.479
Gonna stick to the north side
of this so far.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.835
Scan on it.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.198
'Bout 500 foot of riser left.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.159
BOP's in view.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.800
How's that wellhead surface looking?

03:12.920 --> 03:14.274
Minor corrosion.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.432
Not much more than I'd expect
on wellhead of this age.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.354
All right, mark it. Bring her up.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.717
I just had the craziest dream.

04:04.760 --> 04:05.876
Wow.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.917
Wow? Was I in it?

04:09.280 --> 04:11.192
I was... No.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.830
I was at a concert
and then on the side of the stage

04:14.920 --> 04:16.149
there was this...

04:17.519 --> 04:19.910
It was like a two-legged rabbit and...

04:20.000 --> 04:22.469
I don't know what part of that
is more terrifying.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.314
Listen to me. Listen to me.

04:26.760 --> 04:27.989
I would move...

04:29.320 --> 04:32.358
And then it would mimic
everything I was doing.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.478
Oh, don't tell me anymore,
because I know where this is going.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.798
- I think the rabbit was my mother.
- Mother. Yes. I know.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.440
Thank you. Now it's my nightmare.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.556
Thank you.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.637
- It was hostile.
- Okay.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.598
- It was a hostile rabbit.
- Okay.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.080
I got it.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.629
I'm sorry. What are you doing?

04:52.720 --> 04:54.040
That's it?

04:54.120 --> 04:56.589
That's how you're gonna leave me
for 21 days and nights?

04:56.680 --> 04:59.275
I'm lettin' you get your sleep.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.518
Well, I need many other things than sleep.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.910
You have to promise not to
bring up your mother, though.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.790
All right?

05:07.880 --> 05:12.193
So you want the 30, the 60,

05:12.320 --> 05:14.596
or the 90-second love package?

05:14.680 --> 05:16.558
Honey, I'm gonna take the whole 90.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.040
Oh, the pressure!

05:19.120 --> 05:21.430
The pressure, the pressure, the pressure!

05:23.000 --> 05:24.559
Gonna miss that laugh.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.398
Gonna miss that mouth.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.438
Hey.

05:33.560 --> 05:34.835
Give me those eyes.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.560
Love you!

06:07.960 --> 06:09.474
This is not our deal, dude.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.398
All right. All right.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.111
You consistently overestimate
your skills as a mechanic.

06:35.640 --> 06:36.630
What was that?

06:38.120 --> 06:39.315
Let's go, baby.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.153
- Let me drive.
- Mmm-mmm.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.515
- Let me drive!
- Nope.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.080
- Let me drive.
- Nope.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.880
Pretty please?

06:47.960 --> 06:49.360
- Really wanna drive?
- Yeah.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.000
Then sell that piece of shit
and get a Ducati.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.752
Loud. Bull in a china shop.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.474
I only did not knock
because I want a brother.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.398
Okay. Well, that's disturbing.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.358
'Cause you're not supposed to
know anything about that.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.079
You're supposed to just think
babies are cute.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.719
- Loud.
- Will you sit down, please?

07:23.800 --> 07:25.075
I really want a brother.

07:26.240 --> 07:27.594
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

07:27.680 --> 07:28.909
Honey, show Daddy.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.878
- I'm not done.
- You did such a good job.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.474
- It's showtime.
- It's really great.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.438
- You can't look at me.
- Why?

07:36.560 --> 07:37.789
Because it makes me uncomfortable.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.633
My looking at you makes you uncomfortable?

07:39.720 --> 07:40.949
- Stop!
- All right.

07:41.040 --> 07:42.156
My dad is Mike.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.631
He works on a drilling rig that
pumps oil out from underneath the ocean.

07:45.720 --> 07:48.792
No, no, the Deepwater doesn't
pump a drop of oil, okay, baby?

07:48.880 --> 07:49.870
We're the explorers.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.520
So my dad and his friends find the oil.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.672
And then put in all the plumbing
so other lamer crews can come in...

07:55.760 --> 07:57.592
- Don't say "lamer."
- They are lamer.

07:57.680 --> 08:01.034
Okay, but listen, even those lamer dudes,
they don't have to pump anything, remember?

08:01.120 --> 08:02.759
Because that oil wants to
come rushing up naturally...

08:02.840 --> 08:04.672
- No, no, no, shh!
- All right, all right.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.070
Because that oil is a monster,

08:07.160 --> 08:10.119
like the mean old dinosaurs
all that oil used to be.

08:10.200 --> 08:14.160
So for 300 million years,
these old dinosaurs

08:14.240 --> 08:17.119
have been getting squeezed
tighter and tighter...

08:17.200 --> 08:19.635
We get it. We get it.
Just use two "tighters."

08:19.720 --> 08:22.792
'Cause they got miles of earth
and ocean pressing down on them.

08:22.880 --> 08:25.190
They're trapped. Ornery.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.840
Then Dad and his friends
make a hole in their roof.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.190
Yeah!

08:31.320 --> 08:33.630
And these mean old dinosaurs
can't believe it.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.188
So they rush to the new hole. Then, smack!

08:36.280 --> 08:39.114
They run into a big machine
that he and his friends

08:39.200 --> 08:42.989
have down on the ocean floor
called a Big Guy Preventer?

08:43.080 --> 08:44.070
Blowout Preventer.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.595
They run into this stuff called mud...

08:46.680 --> 08:49.559
- All right, get it in there.
- ...that they cram down the straw.

08:49.640 --> 08:52.997
The mud's so thick and heavy,
it blocks the monsters from coming up.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.311
And then they sail away to the next.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.313
That's when all the lame-o's show up
all happy like they did something.

08:58.400 --> 08:59.675
Don't say "lame-o."

08:59.760 --> 09:02.559
But it was my daddy
who tamed the dinosaurs.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.120
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.112
That was amazing.
Stay ten forever, please.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.998
Daddy, you need to get me a fossil.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.355
- Oh, yes.
- I will.

09:10.440 --> 09:14.593
I wanna be able to hold it up and say,
"My daddy tames the dinosaurs."

09:16.000 --> 09:17.798
Tell Daddy what Maggie's dad did.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.998
Her dad works at the zoo.
And he brought a real penguin.

09:22.040 --> 09:23.793
- You can't do that!
- Brought in a penguin.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.872
How do you compete with a penguin?

09:26.000 --> 09:28.390
- You get a fossil.
- There should be rules.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.035
Oh, my God.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.760
- Honey!
- What?

09:33.840 --> 09:37.595
- There's only so much stuff in the can!
- Well, stop it! Stop it.

10:06.600 --> 10:11.914
Buy gas to go to work
to buy gas to go back to work.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.310
To buy more gas to get to work.

10:14.400 --> 10:15.390
Hey, you know the passwords, right?

10:15.480 --> 10:18.075
Where the insurance stuff is.
You know, call Schuman first.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.152
- What are you talking about?
- I just...

10:21.240 --> 10:22.390
- What are you on about?
- I just...

10:22.480 --> 10:24.949
I just got a little spooked on the
go-home chopper last hitch. It's not...

10:25.040 --> 10:26.030
Gimme some of that.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.476
Babe, the only time you start
worrying about a Marine

10:28.560 --> 10:29.960
is when he stops bitching.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.635
- Don't use my lines against me.
- I'm using your line against you.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.313
- Don't use my lines.
- I just did.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.000
- All right, babe.
- All right, Fish.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.196
- I love you.
- I love you.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.960
- See ya in three weeks.
- Okay. In three weeks.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.918
Behave.

11:23.920 --> 11:25.195
Next.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.794
Good morning, Mr. Jimmy.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.519
- How we doin', Sarah?
- Good. How are you?

11:28.600 --> 11:29.795
- I'm good.
- You can place your bags

11:29.880 --> 11:32.440
on the baggage scale and step on the feet.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.989
- Where you headed today?
- Same place. Deepwater Horizon.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.639
- Where you flying out to?
- Deepwater Horizon.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.996
- And who you work for?
- Transocean.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.070
Wanna know how much you weigh?

11:40.160 --> 11:41.480
- You know I do.
- 181.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.517
- What'd I tell ya?
- Yeah, you did good.

11:43.640 --> 11:44.994
- Keep it that way.
- All right.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.878
Alrighty. Have a seat in
the lobby and we'll call you

11:46.960 --> 11:48.155
- when your flight's ready.
- Thank you.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.356
Mr. Sims?

11:49.440 --> 11:51.079
- Mr. O'Bryan?
- David Sims.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.150
My name's Jimmy Harrell.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.197
Offshore Installation Manager
on Deepwater.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.636
Buddy, thank you very much
for taking us out today.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.280
I know you guys are swamped
and you didn't have to.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.353
No, I had to.
Listen, you mind losing that tie?

12:03.400 --> 12:04.800
I would.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.600
It's not the tie. It's... It's the color.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.554
- Purple?
- More magenta.

12:11.720 --> 12:12.676
And?

12:12.760 --> 12:16.549
Well, magenta alarm on an oil rig
is as bad as it gets.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.392
That's worthy of superstition.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.559
- Good morning.
- Mike Williams.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.871
- Where you headed today?
- Deepwater Horizon.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.750
All right.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.515
What'd ya do on your downtime?

12:44.520 --> 12:46.751
I started workin' on that airboat again.

12:46.840 --> 12:47.876
Yeah?

12:47.960 --> 12:52.113
I'm upping it from
600 horsepower to 1,200 horsepower.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.830
And I got me a little, uh,
Sensenich prop off that Super Cub.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.397
- Trying to make it fly?
- No, I just wanna make it go faster.

13:06.720 --> 13:07.995
Loud and clear.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.230
Roger. Got everyone.

13:09.320 --> 13:12.870
Hey, Bosco, I got the Deepwater Horizon
coordinates in the FMS.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.713
492, your tail is clear.

13:14.800 --> 13:18.157
Wind is calm. 2-1 is in use.
Altimeter 2997.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.510
Paris Control,
this is Bristow 2 Bravo Gulf.

13:43.600 --> 13:48.038
We're headin' out into open ocean.
ETA 45 minutes to Deepwater Horizon.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.236
Copy that, Bristow 2 Bravo Gulf.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.880
What is it you do at BP, Mr. Sims?

13:53.960 --> 13:56.998
- Completions.
- Oh, shit, here we go, Jimmy.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.231
Well, as you know, we...
We a little behind.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.960
Forty-three days.
But who's countin', right?

14:09.600 --> 14:10.875
What were you gonna do
with your bonus, Mike?

14:10.960 --> 14:13.077
- Dig a pool. You?
- Fix my car.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.152
You do know the first well
collapsed on us?

14:15.240 --> 14:18.392
Took us five days just to pull a
million-dollar drill pipe out.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.630
Whose fault was that?

14:19.720 --> 14:21.040
What are you drivin'
that needs that much work?

14:21.120 --> 14:22.554
- '69 Mustang.
- Fastback?

14:22.640 --> 14:23.790
- Vinyl top.
- What's up with it?

14:23.880 --> 14:24.870
Today it was a rough idle.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.111
Made the exhaust smell like
gas right out of the pump.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.034
- You smell gas when it's not running?
- No. So it's not a leak in the tank.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.760
- Hey!
- Shit!

14:36.640 --> 14:38.313
That was a bird strike, folks.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.080
I ain't sayin' nothin'.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.152
Deepwater Horizon is only a mile out.

14:49.400 --> 14:53.110
We should be fine to land.
We'll run a safety check there.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.920
Well, anything that big
oughta be made by God.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.360
That's beautiful.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.274
And you know it's not on stilts.
It's not a jack-up.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.432
Yeah, I do, and I still
can't believe that thing's a boat.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.637
Well, you can thank
this very talented young lady

15:06.720 --> 15:08.279
right back here for that.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.677
What the hell's the Bankston doin' here?

15:18.760 --> 15:20.194
Who gave that order?

15:22.760 --> 15:24.160
2 Bravo Gulf, permission to land,

15:24.240 --> 15:25.230
Deepwater Horizon.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.317
Permission granted, 2 Bravo Gulf.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.310
- Beginning our descent.
- Roger that.

16:02.480 --> 16:03.709
Welcome aboard!

16:06.360 --> 16:07.840
You guys already done?

16:07.960 --> 16:09.917
I don't know what to tell you, Mr. Jimmy.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.071
- Hey, you guys finished?
- I don't know what to tell you, Mike.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.272
- Somebody's gotta talk to Vidrine.
- What? Are you finished?

16:16.680 --> 16:18.160
- Hey, Skip.
- Yes, sir.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.276
Logging team is leaving?

16:19.360 --> 16:21.477
Yeah, Schlumberger's out. They're gone.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.599
Briefing said they're supposed to be
testing that cement down there.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.240
- Is it already finished?
- Mike, how you been?

16:30.320 --> 16:33.916
- Skip, are we done here?
- You gotta talk to Vidrine.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.036
Vidrine?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.715
- What'd he say?
- I can't hear him.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.634
What did Mr. Skip say?

16:52.720 --> 16:55.554
They were supposed to test
to see whether the cement was holdin'.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.359
I guess they left without doin' it.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.477
What? Hold up, they didn't...

16:59.560 --> 17:01.916
Those BP sons of bitches
sent the Schlumberger guys home.

17:02.040 --> 17:03.394
- Seriously?
- Yep.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.999
- Kuchta, why is the Bankston here?
- Good morning to you, too.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.958
What is the Bankston doin' here?

17:15.040 --> 17:16.598
Morning, Pete.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.279
Happy to see me?

17:18.359 --> 17:20.352
I'm always happy to see you, Andrea.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.990
- Where's the pisser, Williams?
- Sign that says "toilet".

17:24.079 --> 17:25.309
Skip say anything to you
about runnin' a cement log?

17:25.400 --> 17:26.914
- He ain't call me.
- We win the war here

17:27.040 --> 17:29.077
and I'm just now findin' out about it?

17:29.160 --> 17:32.351
'Cause I sure as hell don't know how they'd
have the time to do the cement test,

17:32.440 --> 17:33.999
'cause they're... they're flyin' away.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.719
Shit, Jimmy, I just drive the boat, man.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.917
- How'd the positive test go?
- Positive test went well.

17:38.040 --> 17:39.474
- We're in rig down mode.
- Rig down mode?

17:39.560 --> 17:41.517
- How we looking?
- Sitting at 166.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.320
Winds are at 185 and around five knots.
Seas are calm. That's good.

17:51.960 --> 17:54.156
Holding great over our watch circle.
Sitting right on top.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.357
Are you still dating that
itty bitty guy with the motorcycle?

17:57.840 --> 17:58.876
Any issues with the thrusters?

17:58.960 --> 18:00.280
- Andrea?
- Yes, sir?

18:00.360 --> 18:02.556
Get on the radio to
Captain Landry on Bankston

18:02.640 --> 18:04.996
and see what he's doin' and why.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.719
You got it, Mr. Jimmy.

18:06.800 --> 18:10.077
Damon Bankston, this is
Deepwater Horizon, over.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.280
Deepwater Horizon,
this is Damon Bankston. Go ahead.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.272
The OIM wants to know
what you're doin' here.

18:16.360 --> 18:20.877
Well, I hear we gettin' off this beast
and movin' on to the next.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.110
You can call it a bitch.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.600
When are we supposed to be leaving?

18:23.680 --> 18:24.670
Well, I'm told to be ready

18:24.760 --> 18:26.877
to start taking on
drilling mud about 1800.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.036
Wow.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.079
I heard you had a positive
pressure test this morning.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.516
I guess they assume the negative test
is gonna run just as smooth.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.239
They told me to get ready
to start moving on.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.551
- Who's "they"?
- BP company men.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.154
Vidrine, Kaluza.

18:39.240 --> 18:42.756
I don't know. I wait for the order
and come pick up your mud.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.069
Any other questions?

18:44.160 --> 18:45.958
Nope. That's it.

18:46.040 --> 18:51.399
So BP company men Vidrine and/or Kaluza
are hoping that we have tamed this bitch

18:51.480 --> 18:54.120
and are ready to displace
drilling mud 1800 hours.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.395
Is that correct, Captain?

18:55.480 --> 18:57.870
That is correct. Mornin', Mr. Jimmy.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.792
All of a sudden.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.519
Just like that.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.875
Thank you, Captain.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.799
And the goddamn phones
still don't work, Mike.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.349
- Hey, I flew in with you, Mr. Jimmy.
- Would you do me a favor?

19:10.440 --> 19:11.760
Run down to the drill shack.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.753
Ask Jason if those
Schlumberger guys did their job.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.234
Did they run the cement log?

19:16.320 --> 19:18.277
Roger that.

19:18.360 --> 19:21.751
Thank you. Gentlemen,
you couldn't perhaps enlighten me

19:21.840 --> 19:24.196
on this cement log situation, could ya?

19:25.680 --> 19:27.080
Cement log?

19:27.160 --> 19:29.470
Do you know if they're planning it?
Running it? Did it?

19:30.640 --> 19:31.676
Yeah?

19:32.800 --> 19:34.359
Not really. Hey, Ronnie.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.438
Might be an ignition
problem with your Mustang.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.352
I was thinking it was maybe fouled plugs.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.716
Well, it could be a wire.
Could be distributor.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.951
- Does it sound like it's skipping?
- Nope.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.713
You know what I'm gonna
do for you, young lady?

19:44.800 --> 19:47.156
Keep thinking about all the expensive
things could be wrong with your ride.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.790
- Gee, thanks.
- Hey, stick shift or automatic?

19:50.880 --> 19:51.870
Do you know me?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.639
Oh, you gotta stop grindin'
shit out of that clutch.

19:53.720 --> 19:54.710
I know that.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.315
- Oh, yeah. Says Mr. Toyota.
- Uh-huh. Yeah. Uh-huh.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.880
Attention on the rig.
Attention on the rig.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.314
Rig safety announcement...

20:12.760 --> 20:14.399
Roughneck movin'.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.069
Come to me, baby.
Come to me, baby. Come on.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.192
Bleed 400 barrels of mud.

20:27.280 --> 20:29.590
Roger that. Beginning actuation.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.030
Can I say...

20:34.120 --> 20:36.271
"Trippin' pipe is lots of fun
lots of fun, lots of fun"

20:36.360 --> 20:37.635
Shut up.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.590
Hey. Duck!

20:41.760 --> 20:43.035
What up, Mike?

20:45.600 --> 20:47.831
- How you doin', Caleb?
- Hey, Mike, how you doin', man?

20:47.920 --> 20:48.990
I was a lot better couple hours ago.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.992
- Why's that?
- I was asleep.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.677
We all got woken up
and got us working over.

20:54.760 --> 20:57.480
We got a lotta pipe to pull
if we're gonna get out of here tonight.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.789
What's up with street clothes?
You look pretty.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.349
Man, Mr. Jimmy's pissed and wants to
know if we got a cement bond log test.

21:01.440 --> 21:04.114
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

21:04.280 --> 21:05.714
- No? Hey, Shane!
- Yeah?

21:05.800 --> 21:07.075
Come here, boy.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.873
Schlumberger run a cement bond log test?

21:08.960 --> 21:10.633
I don't know. I don't think they did it.

21:10.720 --> 21:13.280
- I just woke up, so...
- Is that stupid?

21:13.360 --> 21:14.430
I don't know if it's stupid, but...

21:14.520 --> 21:15.795
- It ain't smart.
- It ain't smart.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.317
Look at you guys.
Like synchronized swimmers.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.471
I think you think too much,
you gonna give him a headache.

21:21.560 --> 21:22.596
All right, get the hell out of here.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.592
- All right, yeah.
- Up, up, up.

21:28.160 --> 21:30.038
Okay, I'm watchin' our roughnecks.

21:30.120 --> 21:31.918
- Fellas.
- What the hell are you wearing?

21:32.000 --> 21:34.674
Mr. Jimmy wants to know if the team from
Schlumberger ran a cement bond log test.

21:34.760 --> 21:35.989
- A what?
- Cement job.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.912
Test the cement job.
Come on, man, work with me.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.434
- Who's that again?
- Oh, cut the shit, man.

21:39.520 --> 21:42.433
- Come on, Jimmy's pissed, man.
- Schlum-burger, you democrat.

21:42.520 --> 21:43.556
Well, did we run the test?

21:43.640 --> 21:46.314
No, Vidrine, Kaluza sent 'em home
without testin' anything.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.720
Why in the hell would they do that?

21:47.800 --> 21:50.031
They never feel the urge
to take me through their thinkin', Mike.

21:50.160 --> 21:52.117
But I assume it's got
somethin' to do with...

21:52.200 --> 21:54.715
Money, money, money, money...

21:54.800 --> 21:56.598
Money!

21:56.680 --> 21:58.239
Your phones are broken.

21:59.240 --> 22:00.356
Shit.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.595
Hey, Mr. Jimmy.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.160
Go ahead.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.630
BP sent Schlumberger team home
without running any test.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.956
There was no cement bond log.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.360
Thank you, Mike.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.071
Mike, "A" chair just crashed.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.675
- Goddamn it.
- Blue screen o' death again.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.319
Hey, Duck, is your chair still up?

22:18.440 --> 22:20.272
My computer screen is shaky.

22:20.400 --> 22:22.119
And my smoke detector's out.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.715
How you doin', Mike? Shit.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.276
I'm gonna dump my bags and grab
my tools and I'll be back to fix it.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.158
Doin' it all with Band-Aids
and bubble gum, my man.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.433
Every time I peel off a Band-Aid
on this rig, I find three or four more.

22:32.520 --> 22:33.920
Spit and glue ain't gettin' it done.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.639
One more time with the "money". Come on.

22:35.720 --> 22:36.756
Come on, you been rehearsin' for weeks.

22:36.840 --> 22:37.956
Money, money, money...

22:38.040 --> 22:39.315
No, no, the good part, man.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.631
That is the good part! Money!

22:41.720 --> 22:44.394
I'd kill for that money,

22:44.480 --> 22:46.153
Almighty dollar.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.230
Hi, Hollywood.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.639
- Hey, Mike!
- What's the word, Dale?

22:55.720 --> 22:56.790
What do you know? We done?

22:56.880 --> 22:58.633
Not much. Could be.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.076
Yeah, I'm going fishing tonight.
Undercover.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.833
I got a feelin' we're
getting off this well tonight.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.673
I don't think nobody's
gonna be doin' no fishin'.

23:04.760 --> 23:08.037
You gonna use your crane, man?
Maybe catch a beluga or Shamu?

23:08.120 --> 23:10.919
Good idea. Shit.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.276
Wanna make a bet we're at
the same spot next hitch?

23:13.400 --> 23:14.914
- Yeah, give me odds.
- 50-to-1.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.390
Ah, shit. I ain't touchin' that.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.837
- 30-to-1. Same spot.
- No way.

23:20.960 --> 23:23.429
Mike Williams, you cheap bastard!

24:09.000 --> 24:10.116
- Patrick.
- What's goin' on, Mike?

24:10.200 --> 24:11.793
- What's the word?
- I heard we done.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.519
- You heard we're done?
- Yeah, I heard we're done.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.671
- Who'd you hear that from?
- I can't tell y'all that, Mike.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.750
What do you mean, you can't tell me that?

24:16.840 --> 24:17.830
I just can't tell y'all that, Mike.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.274
- Why can't you tell me that?
- I just can't tell ya.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.079
But I can tell ya that
Gordon's lookin' for ya.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.594
Did Gordon tell you we were done?

24:22.680 --> 24:23.830
- No.
- What does Gordon want?

24:23.920 --> 24:25.434
I don't know.
He got somethin' to show you.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.034
- What do you know?
- I know we're done.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.156
Were you in my shop?

24:30.160 --> 24:31.514
- No.
- Don't touch my shit.

24:31.600 --> 24:32.829
I wasn't touchin' your shit.

24:32.920 --> 24:33.910
All right, go fix something.

24:34.000 --> 24:34.990
All right, have a wonderful day, Mike.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.753
Yeah, you too. Shit.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.995
Hold on, baby, hold on.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.400
Shh. What were you sayin'?

24:45.480 --> 24:47.358
Great news. Chopper didn't crash.

24:47.480 --> 24:50.871
Shit, I assumed and then I remarried.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.440
Oh, yeah? He rich?

24:52.520 --> 24:54.113
Remember what your mama always said,

24:54.200 --> 24:56.954
"Just as easy to marry
a rich man, Felicia, honey."

24:57.040 --> 24:59.794
Baby, if I had a nickel for
all the dumb shit my mom said,

24:59.880 --> 25:01.075
I wouldn't need a rich man.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.914
You gotta fix this by the way.
You have got to fix this stove.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.232
I'm gonna fix it as soon as
I get home, don't worry.

25:07.320 --> 25:08.595
Hey, come close to the computer.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.354
- Huh?
- Come over to the computer.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.430
Give me those eyes.

25:12.520 --> 25:13.954
How is it out there?

25:14.040 --> 25:15.633
Same shit. Well from Hell.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.639
- You ready?
- Ready?

25:18.720 --> 25:21.554
- Three... One...
- Two... Go!

25:25.080 --> 25:26.230
That face.

25:27.720 --> 25:28.756
Sociopath.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.837
Oh, that's... That is focus.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.754
That is determination.
That is intensity. Drive!

25:38.400 --> 25:40.995
- I got you.
- I hate losing to you. I hate it.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.434
I'll see you soon, okay?

25:42.560 --> 25:43.960
All right. See ya.

25:46.200 --> 25:50.194
Why they touchin' my shit?
Touchin' my shit.

25:50.280 --> 25:52.431
Touchin' my shit.

25:52.560 --> 25:54.631
I can tell ya they want us
to head to our next location.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.074
Kaskida.

25:57.080 --> 26:00.915
Was this run by anybody at BP?
Kaluza, Vidrine, anybody?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.435
Vidrine ran it by me.
This... This comes from Vidrine.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.917
Bob, let me impose upon you
what I think is most important here.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.472
We need to go from Macondo
to Kaskida by May 16th.

26:13.560 --> 26:17.554
Kaskida is an uncommon prospect.
Three to four billion barrels?

26:17.680 --> 26:19.512
That's worth more than BP itself.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.074
Do I look like fuckin' Santa Claus.

26:22.160 --> 26:23.833
You do look a little like Santa Claus.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.910
Coach Miles may have played in Michigan,
but that boy got Louisiana soul.

26:29.000 --> 26:31.117
- Versus Saban?
- Hey, just 'cause we win...

26:31.200 --> 26:33.396
Roy! Sayin' "we" like you went to 'Bama?

26:33.480 --> 26:34.550
Did you go to LSU?

26:34.640 --> 26:36.552
When I was potty trained,
I was taught to flush,

26:36.640 --> 26:38.074
wave and say, "See you at Tuscaloosa."

26:38.200 --> 26:39.600
Hey, you boys working for the government?

26:39.680 --> 26:40.875
Cleaning a clean room?

26:40.960 --> 26:44.795
We're still finding mud
from the last kick. Over 5,000 PSI.

26:44.880 --> 26:48.476
- Grab a mop!
- Whoo! That's just crazy.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.354
Look what the pressure did
to this drill string during the kick.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.999
- That's one for the trophy case.
- True dat.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.992
Hey, Patrick said
you got somethin' for me.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.070
Yes, sir.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.198
Before y'all took off last time,
shaker four goes down.

26:59.280 --> 27:00.600
After some pokin' and proddin',

27:00.720 --> 27:02.837
I finally found the source of the problem.

27:02.920 --> 27:03.910
Check this out.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.310
I been hidin' this for you
since your last hitch.

27:08.720 --> 27:09.790
Is that a tooth?

27:11.000 --> 27:12.036
Oh, buddy!

27:12.120 --> 27:15.192
You just made a little girl's year.
And her old man's. Thank you.

27:15.320 --> 27:16.993
I owe you, man. Oh-oh!

27:21.840 --> 27:23.752
All right, boys, let's rig up the kelly.

27:23.840 --> 27:25.479
Hey, Gordon.

27:26.760 --> 27:29.514
Hey, fellas, I'm tellin' ya, it's
gonna be a full-on shit storm once Mr...

27:29.640 --> 27:32.553
- They sent them home.
- Yeah.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.471
- Walk with me, Mike.
- Where we headed?

27:37.560 --> 27:39.153
To murder some BP company men.

27:39.240 --> 27:41.675
- Shit, I got hammer, screwdriver.
- Excellent.

27:43.680 --> 27:46.593
Say, Mike, did you brush
your teeth this morning?

27:46.680 --> 27:47.750
Yes, sir.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.718
Boy, did you floss?

27:49.800 --> 27:51.439
No. No, why?

27:51.520 --> 27:54.672
Save ya a lotta pain and money
in the long run, I'll tell ya.

27:55.720 --> 27:56.710
- Shit.
- Jimmy's...

27:56.800 --> 27:58.029
Oh, he's about to go off on the BP guys.

27:58.120 --> 27:59.713
- They never ran that cement log.
- They didn't run nothin'.

27:59.800 --> 28:01.439
They sent 'em home without doin' shit,
now we goin' after BP.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.955
Hey! What's the matter?
What, ya owe 'em a lotta money?

28:04.040 --> 28:05.633
Come on, Mike, stay on my hip.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.393
- Shit!
- Get 'em.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.390
Yeah, baby.

28:10.400 --> 28:13.359
Don, look at line 51.
Your ceiling cost variances.

28:13.440 --> 28:14.999
I'm not showing 51.

28:15.080 --> 28:18.232
Well, if it isn't
Don Vidrine and Bob Kaluza.

28:18.320 --> 28:21.119
- Welcome back, Mr. Jimmy.
- Oh, yeah.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.238
So, we got all 500 feet
of cement poured, huh?

28:25.240 --> 28:26.310
Yep.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.596
That cement's the only thing
between us and a blowout.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.313
- And it's cured?
- Yes.

28:30.400 --> 28:31.720
Had enough time, huh?

28:32.720 --> 28:33.995
Takes time to do it right.

28:34.080 --> 28:37.357
I mean, if that cement job is compromised

28:37.440 --> 28:38.874
then everything above it is, too.

28:38.960 --> 28:41.350
Well, it's not compromised.
Houston doesn't have a problem.

28:41.440 --> 28:44.353
So I assume Schlumberger guys
said the same?

28:44.440 --> 28:46.875
Cement bond log they ran
said the same, yeah?

28:46.960 --> 28:51.273
We are confident in the integrity
of our cement job, are we not?

28:51.360 --> 28:54.353
Oh, we quite comfortable with the
integrity of that cement, that for true.

28:54.440 --> 28:58.195
You guys are just like my granddad.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.270
Pardon?

28:59.360 --> 29:02.797
Well, you see, my granddaddy, he, uh,
he never even went to the dentist

29:02.880 --> 29:04.712
'cause he didn't wanna know
all what was wrong

29:04.800 --> 29:06.075
'cause then he'd have to deal with it.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.038
You don't wanna know if that cement job

29:08.120 --> 29:12.353
on this well is shit 'cause you're
43 days and $50 million over budget.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.955
You really should include
yourself in that, Mr. Jimmy.

29:15.040 --> 29:19.478
BP picked this spot to drill, Bob.
Consequences of that's on you guys.

29:19.560 --> 29:21.916
'Course, I gotta try to deal
with those consequences,

29:22.000 --> 29:23.070
so yeah, I'm included.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.117
The point is,
you sent the testing team home

29:25.240 --> 29:26.435
before they could do their job,

29:26.520 --> 29:28.830
maybe give y'all some news
y'all didn't wanna hear.

29:28.920 --> 29:31.799
What would it have cost you
to run that test, huh? 125 grand?

29:33.120 --> 29:35.237
You're a $180 billion company
and you're cheap.

29:35.320 --> 29:39.030
That's why we a $186 billion company.

29:39.120 --> 29:42.557
- We worry about those bills.
- I worry about my rig.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.314
My crew lives on it. You just rent it.

29:45.400 --> 29:48.791
Don, you and I both know
we need some downtime for maintenance.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.349
Mike, how many of our machines
need repair?

29:51.440 --> 29:54.194
- 390, Mr. Jimmy.
- Three hundred and ninety?

29:54.280 --> 29:56.590
Yes, sir. Almost ten percent
of all the machinery aboard.

29:56.680 --> 29:58.080
Name a few for me.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.753
A few?

29:59.840 --> 30:04.153
I would love to hear exactly what piece
of mission critical equipment are down.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.317
Shit, where do I start?

30:06.400 --> 30:10.030
"A" drilling chair. Process Station 18.
BOP control pods. Telephone system.

30:10.160 --> 30:13.358
Pipe-racking system. GPS antenna.
Direct TV system. Wireless Internet.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.352
Iron roughneck.
Top drive rack back system.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.432
Auxiliary draw-works control.
Salt water service pumps.

30:17.520 --> 30:19.273
Smoke alarms in the galley.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.430
And the reason why you're sweatin' so hard

30:20.520 --> 30:22.830
is 'cause the compressor for the AC
on this deck are down, too.

30:24.520 --> 30:26.273
Everything but the toilets, huh?

30:26.360 --> 30:29.432
No, no, you got problems there, too,
but I don't do shitters. That's Engineering.

30:30.520 --> 30:31.874
Who are you?

30:32.880 --> 30:34.678
Mike Williams, chief ET.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.958
I'ma tell you like I told
your executives on the chopper ride in.

30:38.040 --> 30:40.555
And how 'bout the timing of that visit?

30:40.640 --> 30:43.633
We gonna properly secure this well

30:43.720 --> 30:47.316
before a production platform come in
right after us and starts pumpin' oil.

30:47.400 --> 30:50.632
Unfortunately,
to do it properly takes time.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.952
43 days? 44 days?

30:54.080 --> 30:55.070
Keep countin', Bob.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.800
45 days? 46 days?

30:57.880 --> 30:59.599
- Have a cookie, Bob.
- Oh.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.159
Can't run a cement log.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.719
I'll tell you what we gonna do now.

31:04.880 --> 31:08.430
We gonna run the negative pressure test,
before we do anything else.

31:08.520 --> 31:10.557
If you really think we need to.

31:10.680 --> 31:13.195
I really think we need one,
Bob, and so should you.

31:13.280 --> 31:16.990
Especially since we got no idea
whether this well is stable or not.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.197
Hey! Dial tone! Day's lookin' up.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.556
Mr. Anderson, it's Mr. Jimmy.

31:24.640 --> 31:28.998
We gonna run a negative pressure test.
Start trippin' out 3,000 feet of pipe.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.070
Thank you.

31:44.080 --> 31:45.355
Young man, pardon me.

31:45.440 --> 31:48.194
Can you tell me where I could
find a Mr. Mike Williams?

31:48.280 --> 31:50.954
Yes, sir. He's in the ET shop
on the second deck by the coffee shop.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.918
- Thank you much.
- Have a wonderful day, sir.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.354
And you, sir.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.640
Mr. Williams?

32:01.480 --> 32:02.914
Mr. Vidrine, are you lost?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.559
Not at all.

32:04.640 --> 32:08.600
Just was lookin' to come by
and visit with ya for a minute.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.353
Well, how can I help you?

32:10.440 --> 32:14.070
Seems as though you had something more
you wanted to say in there.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.795
And I thought I'd give you
the time to say it.

32:22.640 --> 32:27.396
- Okay, so... This rig is broke?
- I didn't say that.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.039
Sounded like you did.

32:30.160 --> 32:32.038
Is there a reason
you're in my shop, Mr. Vidrine?

32:32.120 --> 32:35.716
We a big company, Mike, BP.

32:35.800 --> 32:39.589
A very big far-reaching,
complex organization.

32:39.680 --> 32:42.673
Lot of movin' parts.
Millions of movin' parts.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.036
Thousands upon thousands of people.

32:46.040 --> 32:49.920
And we all work very hard to
ensure that all those people

32:50.000 --> 32:52.959
and all those movin' parts
are functionin' properly

32:53.040 --> 32:54.679
as a means to an end.

32:54.760 --> 32:59.232
A very profitable end for all of us.
So they the big picture.

32:59.320 --> 33:04.111
They the little picture, like you
and the malfunctionin' shitters.

33:04.200 --> 33:08.433
But you see, in point of fact,
they all kind of interconnected.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.796
They a flow at work here, Mike.

33:10.880 --> 33:14.237
So if you off, it's off. Then I'm off.

33:14.320 --> 33:17.518
Then we off.
Then the whole damn train is off.

33:18.680 --> 33:22.594
- You feel me, Mr. Williams?
- You on medication, Mr. Vidrine?

33:23.720 --> 33:30.240
I am merely tryin' to assess just how
close this train is huggin' the tracks.

33:31.880 --> 33:33.792
Okay. I hear ya.

33:33.880 --> 33:35.519
You want my take?
I mean, you really want my take?

33:35.600 --> 33:37.717
- I do.
- Okay.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.315
I think you all tryin' to run out
of fuel as the wheels touch down.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.233
Runnin' out of gasoline as
the plane lands is not smart.

33:44.320 --> 33:47.597
It's flawed thinking.
It's hope as a tactic.

33:49.200 --> 33:53.399
Duly noted. And much appreciated, sir.

33:53.480 --> 33:55.358
Just the opinion of the little guy.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.198
That a catfish?

33:59.280 --> 34:01.840
Yep, 65 pounds.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.276
What y'all call that? Nibblin'?

34:04.360 --> 34:06.636
Noodlin'. We noodle for catfish.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.313
And you know, it's funny,
'cause when we go noodlin',

34:09.440 --> 34:11.159
my best friend Peanut and I,
we go down there

34:11.239 --> 34:12.514
with a fifth of Crown and a lake.

34:12.600 --> 34:13.716
Walk down the boat ramp.

34:13.800 --> 34:17.237
We look for the biggest, darkest,
blackest hole we can stick our arm in.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.833
And we hope one o' them
big ass sons-o-bitches

34:18.920 --> 34:22.311
bites down on us as hard as he can,
so we can rip his ass out of that hole.

34:22.400 --> 34:23.880
We wanna get bit.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.553
That's the plan.

34:25.639 --> 34:27.279
Difference is, we're ready for that bite.

34:28.280 --> 34:29.350
We are ready.

34:29.440 --> 34:33.400
We're wearin' shoes, hats, gloves,
skullcaps, sunglasses, and we are ready.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.676
I don't stick my hand
in that hole with that monster

34:35.800 --> 34:37.518
and hope for the best.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.956
Uh-uh. Hope ain't a tactic, Don.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.036
I thank you for your time.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.474
Have a wonderful day, sir.

34:48.560 --> 34:50.710
And you.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.393
Piece of shit.

34:56.639 --> 34:58.597
Attention on the rig, negative
pressure test is about to commence.

34:58.680 --> 35:02.116
All non-essential personnel, please
stay clear of the rig floor, mud pits...

35:02.200 --> 35:03.429
Bring her into the current.

35:03.520 --> 35:05.910
Come right ten degrees.
Lock heading at 1-7-6.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.713
Coming right ten degrees.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.314
Turning to 176.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.392
Turning.

35:18.600 --> 35:19.920
Damon B. Bankston...

35:20.000 --> 35:21.229
What is that, your fifth cup?

35:23.840 --> 35:24.876
I'm just saying.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.794
You go ahead and make sure everybody's
up and fed and ready to get after it.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.111
- This might be the final test.
- Roger that.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.110
Another negative pressure test?

35:32.200 --> 35:34.078
Another. Another negative pressure test.

35:34.160 --> 35:36.231
- Is there a problem?
- We got a bad well.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.829
They're all bad wells.
We're in a tough prospect.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.274
Got that sledge, Hollywood?

35:40.360 --> 35:41.350
All right, we're in.

35:44.360 --> 35:46.272
On station. Locked.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.198
Locked at 1-7-6, Captain.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.634
We came right ten degrees.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.313
We locked in.
Y'all can run the negative test.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.993
Yeah.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.560
- Go ahead, Jason.
- Copy that.

35:55.640 --> 35:57.359
Closing the annular.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.480
Initiating negative pressure test.

36:22.560 --> 36:25.234
Initiating drill pipe pressure test.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.713
You really think this is the last test?

36:50.800 --> 36:55.079
Shit. I hope so, yes.
This here's the Well from Hell, girl.

37:20.120 --> 37:22.032
Yeah, well, that ain't gonna last long.

37:23.320 --> 37:24.640
That's all you got?

37:25.960 --> 37:26.950
Goal!

37:38.040 --> 37:40.077
A hundred pounds per square inch.

37:41.480 --> 37:44.552
That's okay.
She's pushing back on us a little.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.359
Just trying to keep us honest.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.396
Hey, Don.

37:51.480 --> 37:54.279
Did you get that bottle of wine
I sent ya 'bout a month ago?

37:54.360 --> 37:58.070
I did indeed. Thank you very much.
I not only got it, I drank it.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.510
- Pretty good, huh?
- Very nice, thank you.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.478
That's Super Tuscan, yeah?

38:02.560 --> 38:05.075
"Gah-jah," yeah? I know you like that.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.879
Gaja.

38:07.960 --> 38:09.076
Sorry?

38:09.160 --> 38:11.356
Gaja, it's called.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.634
I think they're about halfway there.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.275
How much coffee
you drinking these days, Hank?

38:25.360 --> 38:27.431
Well, Captain, I gave it up
several months ago.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.273
I drink nothing but green tea now.

38:29.360 --> 38:31.317
Stopped taking the coffee.
Doing the yoga every day.

38:33.400 --> 38:34.516
Two weeks now.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.713
450 PSI.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.233
This don't look good to me.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.353
Pressure warning.

39:05.360 --> 39:06.350
Nine hundred.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.153
What the hell? Shit.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.354
Pressure alert.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.079
1395.

39:26.080 --> 39:30.393
Pressure alert. Pressure alert.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.752
Pressure alert.

39:34.760 --> 39:38.800
We're holding at 1395, Mr. Jimmy.
That's a lot of pressure.

39:38.880 --> 39:41.918
Yeah. Enough to cut your car in half.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.798
Opening the upper annular.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.954
Hollywood, open up the drill pipe valve.
We gotta bleed pressure.

39:49.920 --> 39:54.153
Gentlemen, I hate to say this,
but that is a bad test.

39:54.240 --> 39:58.029
- Not necessarily.
- Oh, Don. A good test starts...

39:58.120 --> 40:00.874
Starts at zero. Stays at zero.
Ends at zero.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.515
- Thank you.
- So there was pressure.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.672
But there was no mud
flowing up and outta that pipe.

40:06.760 --> 40:08.035
Now explain that to me.

40:14.520 --> 40:16.591
That's a confusing result,
I'll give you that.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.957
Kaluza and I have talked
about this drill pipe,

40:20.040 --> 40:22.271
until we blue in the face.

40:22.440 --> 40:25.114
There's something off with it.

40:25.200 --> 40:27.590
He says it's a bladder effect.

40:27.680 --> 40:28.875
Bladder effect?

40:28.960 --> 40:30.110
Bladder effect.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.760
He said Jason would know
what he's talking about.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.957
That one's set at
no indication of flow, right?

40:35.040 --> 40:36.997
- Correct.
- Looky here.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.510
Hey! We actually needed that.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.717
Bladder effect.

40:41.800 --> 40:45.191
It is a pocket of pressure,

40:45.280 --> 40:49.035
trapped around the annular,

40:49.120 --> 40:54.673
which reads like drill pressure
because it is trapped right there.

40:54.760 --> 40:57.912
It is sitting right there on the sensor.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.550
If this was a legitimate pressure issue,

41:01.640 --> 41:05.077
then we would have mud
flowing right back up

41:05.160 --> 41:07.470
and out of that drill pipe right there.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.870
Now, how we gonna test this?

41:09.960 --> 41:13.078
We gonna run that
negative pressure test again.

41:13.160 --> 41:15.391
But we gonna run it on the kill line.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.119
Not on the drill pipe.

41:17.200 --> 41:20.113
Obviously, our problem
is with that drill pipe.

41:20.200 --> 41:25.275
You cannot have 1,395 pounds

41:25.360 --> 41:29.354
of pressure per square inch,
enough to cut your car in half,

41:29.480 --> 41:35.351
and not have any fluid being forced up
and outta that pipe by that pressure.

41:37.960 --> 41:41.749
Boys, you got a whole mess of drilling
mud on your boots out there? No?

41:41.840 --> 41:42.876
Hey, Don.

41:46.920 --> 41:48.639
Gotten hot in the drill shack.

41:48.720 --> 41:51.474
We have a problem with that drill pipe

41:51.560 --> 41:55.349
or with the sensor
giving us a false reading.

41:57.240 --> 42:01.632
Or any other of
1,000 moving parts down there.

42:01.720 --> 42:04.189
Now, the way we gonna find out

42:04.280 --> 42:08.069
is run that negative pressure
test on the kill line.

42:08.160 --> 42:10.959
And if they zero pressure, Mr. Jimmy,

42:11.040 --> 42:14.397
then that gonna tell us
all we need to know.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.512
Are we in agreement?

42:16.600 --> 42:19.479
I don't know about agreement,
but never hurts to run a test.

42:19.560 --> 42:20.835
Lovely.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.479
How we doing in here, Mr. Jimmy?

42:22.600 --> 42:24.432
Oh, we doing great.

42:24.560 --> 42:25.550
Aren't we, Don?

42:26.640 --> 42:27.790
Yes, we are.

42:32.360 --> 42:33.589
BP's well.

42:38.240 --> 42:39.230
It is.

42:39.320 --> 42:41.676
- BP's oil.
- Indeed.

42:41.760 --> 42:45.549
And we just the help
y'all hire to drill a hole.

42:45.640 --> 42:47.836
You are correct, Mr. Jimmy.

42:47.960 --> 42:49.917
But we 50 days late.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.593
And the hole ain't drilled.

42:53.560 --> 42:56.120
Now, Mr. Jimmy,
we have a issue in the galley.

42:57.120 --> 42:58.110
- What?
- Yeah, a whole buncha people.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.236
It's a safety issue.

42:59.320 --> 43:00.993
Yeah, won't take but a minute.

43:11.680 --> 43:14.559
It's 43 days behind.
Not 50. Simple mathematics.

43:14.640 --> 43:15.869
Original completion date was March 8th.

43:15.960 --> 43:19.795
It's April 20th today. 43 days. Yup.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.520
Think you money-hungry sons of bitches
at least be good at math.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.074
All right, gentlemen.

43:25.160 --> 43:26.389
Go ahead, Dewey.

43:26.480 --> 43:28.551
Negative pressure test on the kill line.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.994
Switching to kill line test.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.640
Initiating kill line pressure test.

43:32.720 --> 43:33.836
Bladder effect.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.719
That ring true to you?

43:36.840 --> 43:39.594
Well, nothing ever come
outta Don Vidrine's mouth

43:39.720 --> 43:42.633
ever really rang true to me,
but, yeah, I mean...

43:43.640 --> 43:44.869
On its face? Yeah.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.075
There's a logic to it.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.038
It's got merit, but...

43:49.120 --> 43:51.680
I don't know, applied to
drill pipes and kill lines?

43:52.800 --> 43:54.075
It's a little above my pay grade.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.514
We should've seen some mud.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.916
Pressure warning.

44:37.880 --> 44:38.870
Mr. Jimmy!

44:38.960 --> 44:41.555
- Hey! Yeah, Mr. Jimmy!
- Good job!

44:42.760 --> 44:45.958
Deepwater Horizon is receiving
BP's highest safety award

44:46.040 --> 44:47.759
for the seventh straight year.

44:47.840 --> 44:52.232
And it all starts at the top
with the man you call "Mr. Jimmy."

44:56.280 --> 44:58.476
- Mr. Jimmy, Mr. Jimmy...
- Speech.

45:17.160 --> 45:20.551
Held at zero, boss.
It's a good test. No pressure.

45:20.640 --> 45:23.872
Congratulations. Good test.

45:23.960 --> 45:27.590
We still got 1,400 PSI on the drill line.

45:27.720 --> 45:30.918
Drill line and the kill line
should be exactly the same.

45:31.040 --> 45:32.190
They should be all lined up.

45:32.280 --> 45:35.193
We already agreed that there's
something wrong with the drill line.

45:35.280 --> 45:36.760
So why do you keep comin' back to it?

45:36.840 --> 45:38.559
I don't know. Good oil field practice?

45:38.640 --> 45:42.600
No mud. No flow. We got to go.

45:43.760 --> 45:47.276
Now, how quick can we
lock the door on this well?

45:47.360 --> 45:50.637
I'm not doin' nothin' until
Mr. Jimmy's made aware.

45:53.120 --> 45:56.431
Is there a man among you?
Is there an adult here?

45:58.400 --> 46:01.040
You all got the paraphernalia.

46:01.120 --> 46:03.589
The dip. The steel toes.

46:03.680 --> 46:08.835
But it's all bullshit.
We got zero pressure on the kill line.

46:08.920 --> 46:11.389
You nervous as cats.

46:11.480 --> 46:14.837
Afraid to make it work at every turn.

46:14.920 --> 46:18.470
That will be my summary
back to my bosses in London.

46:18.560 --> 46:21.314
- Bob?
- Agreed.

46:23.480 --> 46:28.350
Again, you can call Mr. Jimmy.

46:30.480 --> 46:32.915
And don't let me keep ya from your
ice cream for another second. Thanks.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.230
It's Mr. Jimmy.

46:36.320 --> 46:37.800
Ran the negative test.

46:37.880 --> 46:40.475
It was a good test. We got no pressure.

46:41.480 --> 46:43.711
'Bout to start displacing.
Wanted your blessing.

46:43.800 --> 46:45.280
You sure about this, Jason?

46:45.360 --> 46:49.798
Kill line was good. Sure of that.
That's the only thing I'm sure of.

46:51.200 --> 46:54.034
These guys are all over me.
What do you wanna do?

46:55.520 --> 46:58.672
- Zero flow, correct?
- That's correct. No flow.

47:10.680 --> 47:11.830
We good?

47:13.480 --> 47:16.075
Well, looks like
it's gonna be a long night.

47:17.760 --> 47:20.275
You stay on top of it, Jason.
I'll see you in about a half hour.

47:20.360 --> 47:21.555
Thanks.

47:25.040 --> 47:27.111
Okay, guys, good test.

47:27.200 --> 47:28.350
Yahoo.

47:28.440 --> 47:30.591
Get ready to pull out
10,000 barrels of mud.

47:30.680 --> 47:32.831
I think I'm goin' take a shower
and wash my day off

47:32.920 --> 47:34.559
before I start my night.

47:34.640 --> 47:36.677
- Gonna be a long one, huh?
- Get some ice cream, Mike.

47:36.760 --> 47:38.194
I gotta watch my figure.

47:38.280 --> 47:41.473
Gonna go fix smoke detectors till I don't
feel like poppin' somebody in the mouth.

47:41.560 --> 47:43.517
That's a good idea.

47:43.600 --> 47:44.829
Say "Hi" to Felicia for me.

47:44.920 --> 47:45.956
- Mr. Jimmy?
- Yeah?

47:46.040 --> 47:47.235
We really need for you to leave with this.

47:47.320 --> 47:48.310
Let's just get a... a quick pic.

47:48.400 --> 47:50.198
- Yeah, we'll take a picture.
- Mr. Jimmy.

47:50.280 --> 47:51.714
Congratulations, Mr. Jimmy.

47:51.800 --> 47:53.154
Hey, appreciate it a lot, fellas.

47:57.960 --> 47:59.076
You got the picture?

48:05.080 --> 48:06.196
Come in, Shaker House.

48:06.320 --> 48:08.312
- Go for Shaker House.
- Yeah, we got a good test.

48:08.400 --> 48:10.517
We're gonna start sending you
some mud to clean.

48:10.600 --> 48:11.920
Transfer it to the Bankston.

48:12.000 --> 48:12.990
All right, copy that.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.470
"Nervous as cats." Cats ain't scared.

48:16.560 --> 48:19.155
I had a cat named Oscar,
used to try to mount my Labrador.

48:20.160 --> 48:23.278
I'm opening the annular.
Let's hope that monster ain't awake.

48:26.600 --> 48:29.593
Mud pumps are on.
Removing heavy mud from well.

48:29.680 --> 48:33.993
Mud displacement.
Holding tank two. Four percent.

48:34.080 --> 48:35.799
Boys, we got a good test!

48:35.920 --> 48:38.116
Aw, baby! Let's pump up all this mud!

48:45.000 --> 48:45.990
We done!

48:49.280 --> 48:50.919
- We're goin' home!
- Bring the mud. Bring the mud.

48:52.120 --> 48:54.316
Damon Bankston, this is Deepwater Horizon.

48:54.400 --> 48:56.710
You are clear to approach
and receive drilling mud.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.793
Copy, Deepwater.
Comin' alongside to receive heavy mud.

48:59.920 --> 49:02.640
Reference units good. PDOP good.
All to the norm.

49:05.160 --> 49:08.392
Master of the Deck,
prepare to take on heavy mud.

49:08.480 --> 49:10.073
10,000 barrels.

49:11.280 --> 49:14.079
Attention on the rig.
Pressure tests were good.

49:14.160 --> 49:17.198
Congratulations, DWH crew.
We're gonna be movin' on.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.078
Well from Hell's done, boys.

49:19.160 --> 49:22.836
Oh, man, I'll be in the Basin soon.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.838
Two, three days maybe. Be in my boat.

49:24.960 --> 49:27.839
Drinkin' me a beer.
Catchin' me some sakalay.

49:27.960 --> 49:31.078
Yeah! You big, beautiful mud!

49:31.160 --> 49:33.152
35 percent.

49:33.280 --> 49:34.509
Come on, baby!

49:34.600 --> 49:36.080
- We're going home!
- To the house?

49:36.200 --> 49:38.271
Thought you had plans?
I thought you were goin' out.

49:38.360 --> 49:39.350
Oh, rescheduled.

49:39.440 --> 49:43.116
Oh, oh, oh.
Sweat pants, Bud Light Lime, DVR time.

49:43.200 --> 49:44.600
My fave.

49:44.680 --> 49:47.400
Hmm-hmm. Just a simple country girl.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.833
55 percent.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.912
75 percent.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.229
Do it all again on the next.

50:11.360 --> 50:12.589
Hopefully smoother.

50:12.680 --> 50:13.955
Jason!

50:14.040 --> 50:16.953
I got a 20 barrel increase
in active pits and increase in flow.

50:17.040 --> 50:19.509
- It's not slowin' down.
- All right, stop pumping mud.

50:19.600 --> 50:21.637
- Pressure alert.
- Oh, Lord.

50:23.400 --> 50:24.629
Stand by, Shaker House.

50:24.720 --> 50:28.350
They're shuttin' it down. They must
not be likin' somethin' up there.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.920
Hey, boys, I'ma go take a leak.

50:31.040 --> 50:32.360
- You guys good?
- I got you, buddy.

50:32.440 --> 50:33.715
All right.

50:37.840 --> 50:38.830
Pressure alert.

50:38.920 --> 50:40.673
- It's not stoppin'.
- Clear the drill shack.

50:40.760 --> 50:43.673
- Get him and him out of here.
- What is happening?

50:43.760 --> 50:47.071
Gentlemen, what is the excitement?
We stipulated there's something wrong.

50:47.160 --> 50:48.355
I never should've let you push.

50:48.480 --> 50:50.278
Now get your ass out of here
before I push back.

50:50.400 --> 50:52.790
That comment will be noted.

50:52.880 --> 50:54.200
Hey, I'm ready to get the hell home.

50:54.320 --> 50:56.471
Get me a six pack a beer
and a steak in my ass.

51:00.920 --> 51:02.400
What is goin' on?

51:02.480 --> 51:04.073
Likely nothin', Mr. Kaluza.

51:05.080 --> 51:07.117
- Watch your step over here.
- Shit.

51:08.600 --> 51:09.590
What you got, Caleb?

51:13.360 --> 51:14.589
What the hell's he doin'?

51:30.880 --> 51:32.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, shit.

51:32.400 --> 51:33.720
What the hell's goin' on here?

51:33.800 --> 51:35.712
- We got flow.
- Shit!

51:35.800 --> 51:38.269
That ain't good.
Jason, are you seein' this?

51:38.360 --> 51:39.919
We got flow out here.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.559
- Warning.
- It's not stopping.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.757
Hey, Jason, are you seein' this?

51:43.840 --> 51:45.479
We got mud on the rig floor.

51:45.560 --> 51:46.960
Are they not tellin' you to do anything?

51:47.120 --> 51:48.520
Is she just kickin' or that...

51:51.800 --> 51:52.995
- Oh, shit!
- Clear the floor!

51:55.600 --> 51:57.000
Holy shit! Jason!

52:07.120 --> 52:08.998
Mike, what is that? Is everything okay?

52:12.320 --> 52:13.834
I'm closin' the annular.

52:17.200 --> 52:19.795
- Duck, get in here now!
- Are you shuttin' it in?

52:19.880 --> 52:21.280
All right, we're okay.
I closed the annular.

52:21.360 --> 52:22.760
We got 30 seconds.

52:25.960 --> 52:27.792
Get off the floor now!

52:27.880 --> 52:29.360
- Pressure warning...
- Duck, you okay?

52:29.440 --> 52:31.193
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Get your finger on the EDS.

52:31.280 --> 52:32.509
Get ready to cut that pipe.

52:32.600 --> 52:33.920
This way! This way!

52:36.040 --> 52:37.190
Adam!

52:37.280 --> 52:38.270
Shane!

52:40.480 --> 52:42.039
What do we do?

52:42.160 --> 52:43.355
- Caleb!
- What do we do?

52:43.440 --> 52:45.511
Get on the drill pipe and let it bleed!

52:55.040 --> 52:56.793
Right here. Right, right there.

52:56.880 --> 52:58.360
No, I understand. I understand.

52:58.440 --> 53:01.160
You know, I'm doing my best
to accommodate everybody, but look...

53:06.200 --> 53:07.190
Fuck!

53:20.400 --> 53:23.996
Okay. Okay. We're all right.

53:24.080 --> 53:25.434
We're all right.

53:25.520 --> 53:26.954
Caleb, how you doin', buddy?

53:27.040 --> 53:28.269
Did we cut the pipe?

53:28.360 --> 53:31.319
No, we're good. Annular took care of it.

53:31.400 --> 53:32.914
It was just a kick.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.071
That's the biggest dang kick I ever seen.

53:36.240 --> 53:38.880
She put a whoop ass
on Maggie and her penguin.

53:38.960 --> 53:39.950
Get outta here!

53:40.040 --> 53:41.030
- She did.
- Huh?

53:41.120 --> 53:43.112
And she did it all without this?

53:43.240 --> 53:44.833
No!

53:44.920 --> 53:47.389
That is a genuine dinosaur tooth.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.037
Gas alarm in the mud pits. Again.

54:34.120 --> 54:35.998
Same one goes off every time.

54:36.080 --> 54:37.116
I'll call down.

54:41.880 --> 54:44.270
- ...Roy?
- I got it! You got yours?

54:44.360 --> 54:45.680
GORDO!

54:50.480 --> 54:51.675
Pressure warning.

54:52.840 --> 54:53.910
Pressure warning.

54:54.000 --> 54:56.071
Shit. Jason!

54:56.160 --> 54:57.150
Oh, shit!

54:57.280 --> 54:59.556
Caleb, get everybody off the...

55:14.560 --> 55:15.755
Bypass ain't workin'!

55:15.840 --> 55:17.240
- Damn.
- Holy shit!

55:18.400 --> 55:20.232
- Duck, close the second annular!
- Annular failure.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.875
Adam! Shane! Get down to the Mud Room now!

55:24.960 --> 55:26.553
Adam!

55:26.640 --> 55:28.518
We gotta go, buddy!

55:28.600 --> 55:30.319
We gotta go!

55:30.400 --> 55:32.551
We gotta get to the mud pit! Caleb!

55:33.720 --> 55:34.790
Caleb!

55:34.880 --> 55:36.678
Get off the floor! Get off the floor!

55:40.680 --> 55:42.911
It's Pump 2! Bleed it! Bleed it!

56:01.400 --> 56:04.154
Caleb, close the drill pipe valve
and feed the standpipe.

56:04.240 --> 56:06.072
Divert everything overboard.

56:08.640 --> 56:09.790
Jason, what do we do?

56:31.600 --> 56:33.398
- We got debris!
- Jesus Christ!

56:33.480 --> 56:36.314
Oh shit! Caleb, clear the floor!

56:41.680 --> 56:42.716
You all right?

56:42.800 --> 56:43.995
The alarm didn't sound.

56:44.080 --> 56:46.879
I'm gonna make sure everyone evacuates.
You get to the lifeboats.

56:46.960 --> 56:47.950
- Go!
- Okay.

56:52.080 --> 56:53.116
All stop.

57:06.800 --> 57:08.200
Look out! Look out!

57:09.480 --> 57:11.870
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Get that! Get it! Get it!

57:13.520 --> 57:16.513
- What the heck?
- Damn!

57:22.880 --> 57:24.439
Jesus.

57:25.440 --> 57:27.636
Deepwater Horizon,
this is Damon Bankston. Copy?

57:30.320 --> 57:32.357
- All right.
- BOP's not responding.

57:34.840 --> 57:37.116
- Duck, cut the pipe!
- Okay.

57:37.200 --> 57:38.475
Right now!

57:39.840 --> 57:43.231
- Gas warning...
- Duck! Duck!

57:43.320 --> 57:45.073
What happened? Jesus!

57:46.160 --> 57:47.389
Keith!

57:47.480 --> 57:48.709
Gordie!

57:48.800 --> 57:52.077
- Come on, man! Get up!
- Roy! Come on, man!

57:52.160 --> 57:55.471
We gotta go! We gotta go right now!

58:24.880 --> 58:26.314
Gas warning.

58:26.440 --> 58:28.272
Oh, shit. We got a gas alarm.

58:41.200 --> 58:42.554
Thrusters are over-revving.

58:45.640 --> 58:46.676
My thrusters are running away from me.

58:47.840 --> 58:49.320
I'm not gonna be able to
hold the rig in place.

58:49.400 --> 58:50.880
All right. Just calm down.

58:52.080 --> 58:53.150
Oh, my God.

58:55.840 --> 58:59.277
Is it just me or it just get
real bright in there all of a sudden?

59:06.960 --> 59:07.996
Magenta.

59:08.080 --> 59:09.196
Magenta alarms!

59:09.280 --> 59:10.953
Gas warning.

59:14.920 --> 59:16.400
- The well is blowing out.
- What?

59:19.080 --> 59:20.070
Mike.

59:20.200 --> 59:22.635
Mayday! This is Deepwater Horizon.
We are in a...

59:23.640 --> 59:25.916
What the hell are you doing?
Did I ask you to call a Mayday?

59:28.560 --> 59:30.074
I'll call you back, I'll call you back!

59:33.680 --> 59:36.036
You don't know the difference between
a kick and a goddamn blowout!

59:36.120 --> 59:37.395
- Why's the...
- You don't know shit!

59:37.480 --> 59:38.516
Why's the monitor out?

59:38.600 --> 59:40.114
Gas warning.

59:41.440 --> 59:44.353
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday! This is Deepwater Horizon.

59:52.440 --> 59:54.875
Hang on, Duck. I'm gonna get you out.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:27.878
God damn it! Dewey! Steve!

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.675
- Down!
- Jesus!

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.236
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.913
- This is Deepwater Horizon.
- Rig's on fire.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.315
We've had a major explosion.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.119
- We need assistance...
- Can't you see it's on fire?

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.510
I repeat, we've had
a mass casualty explosion.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:57.994
We need assistance immediately.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.594
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:00.955
This is Deepwater Horizon...

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.838
This is motor vessel Damon Bankston.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:06.038
Deepwater Horizon
has exploded and is on fire.

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.114
I say again, the Deepwater Horizon
has exploded and is on fire.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.520
We just saw a huge explosion.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.751
Yes sir,
we see the Deepwater Horizon on fire.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.992
- Okay. And everybody's off the rig?
- We have no idea.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.079
United States Coast Guard
District 8 Command Center,

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.560
Ensign Von Huene speaking.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.399
Yes, there's an oil rig on fire.

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.676
About 48 nautical miles south of Venice.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:34.078
Okay, an oil rig on fire.
About 48 nautical miles south of Venice?

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.152
Yes, ma'am. I've never
seen anything like it...

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.596
Okay, yes, sir. What vessel are you on?

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:39.750
What's the name of your vessel?

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.080
Coast Guard District 8 Command Center,
this is Lieutenant Degan speaking.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.917
An oil rig on fire?
Sir, do you have a position for that?

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.314
Sir, I'm not exactly sure,

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.278
I need to get some information from you
first if that's all right.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.158
- Can you give me your name, please?
- Okay, sir, what is your location?

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.516
We got 100 miles south of Port Fourchon
there's a vessel reporting a fire.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.636
Where's your call?

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.040
Forty-eight nautical miles
south of Venice.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.715
I had a report from a OSV.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.269
That's the lat/long.
That's a confirmed position.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.716
Sir, we got a satellite
image of the scene.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.870
Right here.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.716
Oh, my God.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.033
Listen, guys,
we need to bump this up, okay?

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.555
Call land area. See what kinda
float cutters we have in the area.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:20.756
Divert 'em over to the area.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.440
Air stations. I need to know
how many bravo aircraft we have up.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.749
Okay, get 'em goin'.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:33.595
Shit!

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:44.190
Shit!

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.715
Evacuation procedure in effect.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.399
This is not a drill.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.120
Evacuation procedure in effect...

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.830
Dougie?

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.560
Dougie? Hey, Dougie, can you hear me?

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:19.155
- What?
- Can you hear me, Dougie?

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.471
- Huh?
- My little brother.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:23.313
What?

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:24.720
It's his birthday.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.236
My little brother.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.515
Your little brother's not here.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.637
What about your legs?
Huh? Can you move 'em?

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.877
- My little brother.
- Look at me, Dougie.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.270
You're gonna need to use 'em.
We gotta get to the lifeboats.

01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.716
I'm gonna get you up. All right?

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.116
Shit.

01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:48.516
Come on.

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.875
Evacuation procedure in effect.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.996
Come on!

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:55.316
Easy.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.240
Thruster 2 failure.

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:07.198
I just lost four
thrusters on the port side.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.270
I only have four left, Captain.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.431
- What do we do?
- I need a damage report.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.193
I'm gonna take manual
control over the rig.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.431
This is Kuchta on the bridge.
I need a damage report.

01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.352
- Come on, baby.
- Where's the fire team? Now!

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.557
This is Damon Bankston
to Coast Guard Rescue.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.711
We have an incident
on the Deepwater Horizon.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.599
Bring her 'round 90 degrees starboard.
Tell me that rescue boat's in the water!

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:29.960
Let's go! We need medical kits!

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.911
Where's the oxygen tanks?
Empty out the supply house! Let's go!

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.315
Go portside!

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.590
Proceed to your assigned lifeboat.

01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.233
Son of a bitch!

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.630
Hey! Hey!

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.234
- He needs to get on the boat!
- Get back in line!

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.390
- He's hurt.
- This man is hurt!

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.800
- This man is hurt bad.
- I don't give a shit!

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.236
Did you hear what I said?
I'm not trying to get on the boat!

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:49.630
This man is hurt real bad.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.234
Do you understand me?

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:54.273
Calm down. Did anybody see Mr. Jimmy?

01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.999
I saw him in Accommodations.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.595
I'm goin' back for Mr. Jimmy.
Make sure this man gets off this rig.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.673
Okay? Everybody, calm down. Slow it down.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.114
- And smooth it out. All right?
- Okay, okay.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.236
All right, let's go.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.590
Hello?

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.636
Hello?

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:44.110
Hello!

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.032
Hey, hey, hey! You're good?

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.190
I think... I think so.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.794
- Where're you goin'?
- I dunno.

01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.030
- Muster.
- No, no.

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.349
You gotta go to lifeboats, okay?

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.430
- Yeah.
- Go to the lifeboats.

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:55.159
Right here.
Come on, we're gonna make a left.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.880
Stay to the wall! Hey! Stay to the wall!

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.316
Hello?

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.075
Mr. Jimmy?

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:22.310
Hey!

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:26.000
- Help!
- Mr. Jimmy!

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.276
Hey!

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:30.270
Who's there?

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:32.350
This way!

01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:39.279
- Mr. Jimmy? Mr. Jimmy?
- Mike! I can't... I can't see shit.

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:40.999
I got... What... what happened?

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.520
- We blew out, Mr. Jimmy.
- Oh, no.

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.273
Lot of secondary explosions, all right?

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:45.510
- All right, we gotta...
- Shit's on fire everywhere.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.075
Have we disconnected? Did we cut the pipe?

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.752
I don't know. But I don't think so.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.354
We need to disconnect, Mike.

01:08:51.479 --> 01:08:53.118
- Help me get to the bridge.
- All right. Come on.

01:08:57.359 --> 01:09:00.432
Gotcha. Gotcha. All right. Come on.

01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.078
Where are we?

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.997
Wouldn't recognize it
even if you could see it.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.151
- This pipe is gonna break.
- Off station alert.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.154
Come on, Mr. Jimmy. Come on.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.752
If you find yourself in the water,
you got a light and a whistle.

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.916
You understand?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.879
If you get into oil or anything
spilling it, swim away from the rig.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:24.156
Should we wait till
the Coast Guard gets us...

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.912
No, we need to go. Okay, we need to go.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.798
Come on, let's go. Now, now, now, come on.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.109
Water's on fire.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.792
Who's coordinating
the air assets out there?

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.314
ATC. Fixed wing, they have...

01:09:32.399 --> 01:09:34.470
West Jefferson, East Jefferson and Tulane

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.676
are prepared to take in multiple...

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.830
- First engine start.
- Locked.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.149
External power.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.912
Coast Guard 1, area's clear.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.149
There's people jumpin' in the water.

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:42.509
He's seen three people
jump into the water.

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:44.319
- Jumpers? You gettin' this?
- We have jumpers?

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:46.278
What's the ETA
on the first on-scene helicopter?

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:49.910
- Sir, it's gonna be like 35 minutes.
- That's about 30 minutes too late.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:55.039
This is US Coast Guard B1 7 departing RRT6

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.033
en route to emergency distress
call for Deepwater Horizon.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.637
ETA to location, 25 minutes.
Silence imposed on this frequency.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.400
Get in! Get in!

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.795
Come on.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:33.870
- You good?
- Yeah.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.514
- All right, come on.
- Help!

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.039
- Can you hear him?
- Call out!

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.713
Shit!

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.710
Call out!

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:43.830
Is someone there? It's Caleb.

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.957
- I need help in here.
- It's Wyman!

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.396
We gotta get outta here.
There's methane everywhere.

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.073
Found him here like this.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:51.594
He's hurt real bad
and I can't get him outta there.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.830
Don't look down, all right?

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:53.956
No. No.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.630
Wait!

01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.074
Shit, his bone's caught on the metal.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.310
Shit!

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.554
Mike!

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:15.633
Come on, we gotta wedge this open.
We gotta find something to get it open.

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.991
Pull! Pull!

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.639
Keep pullin'!

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.676
- I've lost power.
- All right, just stop.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.114
Just gimme a second. Lemme... lemme think.

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:42.355
I'm gonna cut the pipe.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:46.309
Hey, hey, hey.
Andrea, get your ass back on station.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:49.552
- We don't have the authority.
- I'm gonna seal the well.

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.040
Do not touch that button.

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:56.071
- You need to hit the EDS.
- We don't have the authority.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.156
You ain't pushin' it.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:04.274
Can somebody help me? Please?

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.953
Just go! Get outta here!

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.952
You're comin' with or without that leg.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.474
Hold on! Hold on!

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.472
Hey, look at me.
It's gonna hurt like a bitch,

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.791
but just stay calm for a second, okay?
Just stay calm.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.200
Look at me, don't look down, look at me.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.634
- We got you.
- Hold on!

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.594
Pull! Pull!

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.670
Wyman, can you move?

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:23.796
Let's go.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.153
You gotta get me to the bridge, Mike.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.515
Coast Guard District 8 Command Center.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.637
- This is Lieutenant Degan speaking.
- Hi. Sir.

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.794
I just...

01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:43.910
I don't mean to bother ya'

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.516
and I'm sure everything's just fine,
um, but my husband Mike Williams

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.434
is on the Deepwater Horizon, and...

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.955
Yes, ma'am. Right now we only have
a couple confirmed reports

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:55.157
of a fire on an oil rig.
That's about all I can say.

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.914
There... On the Deepwater Horizon?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.957
Because there are so many rigs out there.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.030
You... you sure?

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.998
Yes, ma'am, it is a fire
on the Deepwater Horizon.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:05.390
That's all I can say, ma'am.
I'm sorry, I really have to go.

01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:05.596
What happened?

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.671
- Ken, you all right?
- The derrick's gonna fall on us!

01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.591
Dale, the boat's leaving!

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.672
My crane's gonna take
the goddamn derrick out.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.672
- It's comin' down!
- Get on the boat now!

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.956
I gotta stop it or it's gonna kill us all.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.030
Go, Dale!

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.512
Go, go, go!

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:54.160
Get him up the steps!

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.910
Shit!

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.030
Go, Dale!

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.196
Dale, get outta there! Now!

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.994
Oh, my God.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:13.875
Who's on the bridge?

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.440
- Fleytas.
- Kuchta.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.031
Let's go! We're full! Let's go!

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.636
Report to Muster Station 1!

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:30.672
Get your ass on the lifeboats.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.590
...get to the lifeboats!

01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:40.916
Andrea, Kuchta, have we disconnected?

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.279
- No.
- Andrea, get my hands on the EDS.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.920
I'm gonna cut the pipe and seal this well.

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:49.520
We gonna choke this fire.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.592
- Right here, right here.
- No, no. Up, up!

01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.636
Come on.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:05.315
- Is she still burnin'?
- There's still flow, Mr. Jimmy.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.472
Oh, come on. Please. Please!

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.832
It's still burning, Mr. Jimmy.
We gotta go.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:19.071
This is the last for Lifeboat 1, guys!

01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.231
Hey! Hey! Back up! We're first!

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:24.277
Room for a couple more. Get in!

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.919
We need to restore power up here.

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:32.714
We need to bring
the standby generator online.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.790
For the firefighting pumps?

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:37.960
No, we just wanna keep this rig on station
long as we can so that pipe doesn't break.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.032
That's all we can do.
We can't save this rig.

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.554
All right, then
it can't hurt to go try it.

01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.838
It could very much, Mike.
It's on the other side of that derrick.

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.240
- I know it, I know it.
- I'm coming with you.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.310
What?

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:48.595
- I'm coming with you.
- You sure?

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.115
- I'm with you.
- Go on, Mike.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:59.153
This, uh, this rig, last we heard,
is still burning.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.833
There... there's something burning in
there.

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:03.230
The gasoline, the natural gas, or the oil.

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.310
Is that what you understand, Mike?

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.629
It is still burning.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.792
This platform's about
20 miles south of Grand Isle, Louisiana.

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.600
- Hello?
- Natalie, this is Felicia Williams.

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.354
Our husbands work on the
Deepwater Horizon together.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:17.314
Well, I just called the Coast Guard and they
could just confirm that there's a fire,

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.995
but I just was wondering if
maybe you heard somethin'.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.232
- What did the Coast Guard say?
- Just that there's been a fire.

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.989
Shelly heard people
were jumping off the rig.

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.310
What are you doing?

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.913
Not now, baby.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.515
- What's wrong?
- Not now, baby.

01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:47.680
Oh, shit.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:48.750
Come on.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.470
Oh, shit.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.152
- Lifeboat 1, come on!
- Easy, easy, easy!

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.879
Make your way to Lifeboat 2!

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.952
- Lower the boat!
- Let's go!

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.191
- Oh, fuck this!
- Oh, shit!

01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.795
- Oh, shit! Shit!
- Put it out!

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.758
Shit! Shit!

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.513
- You got gloves?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:34.800
Whoa!

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.753
Get in, get in, get in! Get in!

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.550
Come here!

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:43.550
Mike?

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.313
- Shit.
- Mike, are you there?

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.912
Mike? Mike, bring up power.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.116
You know your way around this thing?

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:53.634
Well, how hard could it be?

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.154
Come here. Rattle this shit off to me.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:57.790
You gotta be shittin' me.

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:58.870
- Come on!
- All right.

01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:00.280
"Turn remote switch to 'local'.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:01.919
System power switch.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.229
Turn to 'on' position."

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.113
Okay. "Press main start button."

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.270
Red one right there.

01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:09.917
I'm impressed, man. I don't know
no roughnecks that could read.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.673
Very funny. Very funny.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.871
You know I had a full ride
to UT architecture school.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:14.950
The hell you doin' here?

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:16.878
- Shoulda' listened to my mom.
- Yeah, you shoulda'.

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.679
Mr. Jimmy, you gettin' any power up there?

01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:19.836
Should be it.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.876
Gettin' any power?

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:23.950
We still outside the watch circle?

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:25.030
Yes, we're off station.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.520
- Bring us back slow.
- Okay.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.920
- Okay.
- Bring us back slow.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.036
Come on, baby, come on!

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.718
- Shit!
- Shit.

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:44.277
Hit your start key. Turn to 'on' position.

01:20:47.560 --> 01:20:49.040
We got ya'. We got ya'.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.630
Watch his leg!

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.713
Wait for the glowplug light.

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:57.672
- Come on.
- Come on!

01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.160
That should be it.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.232
Oh, there we go. There we go!

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:02.720
Mr. Jimmy,

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.240

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.960
- Bring us power, Mike.
- Come on. No. No.

01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.952
Kuchta, can you help me?

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.872
Close the door. No! No, no, no.

01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.592
- Close the goddamn door!
- Get to the boats, Mike.

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.114
- Shit!
- It's over.

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:19.759
We need to get off this.
Jimmy, we gotta go.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.110
Look out!

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:45.476
It's all coming down.
We gotta get to the boats.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.153
Come on, lower the boat!

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.913
Shut the door. We're full.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:53.596
Let's go!

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.073
They left us.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:12.389
They left us!

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.800
Shit!

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:21.597
- Emergency life raft!
- Somebody got a knife?

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:24.313
I need a knife!

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.600
I got one. Watch out!

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.800
Open it up!

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:36.190
Pull that shit!

01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:37.999
- Hold it straight.
- Get on the hand crank!

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.231
Shit! Come on! Pull the slack!

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.880
- Come on, we gotta swing it out!
- Crank it!

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.519
I'm crankin' as hard as I can!

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:45.636
Let's go! Let's go!

01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.313
Come on, stay with me, man, come on!

01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.677
- Oh, shit!
- Tie it off, tie it off!

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:56.353
Shit!

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.430
Tie it off!

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:05.200
Come on! Come on, bring it in!

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.999
Injured first! Let's go!

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:11.319
Where's Andrea? Andrea, let's go!

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.516
Come on, Andrea!

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.879
No, wait! Wait!

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.912
There's too much fire.
We can't jump from here.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.030
We need to get up higher.

01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.759
We need to get up higher. Come on!

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.439
Slow down! Slow down!

01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.795
It's a raft!

01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.593
Hey, hang on!

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.270
Come on.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.039
Bankston Rescue!

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.076
Here!

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.959
- Over here!
- We got ya'. Here you go.

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.719
Come on! We gotta get up.

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:14.790
Come on!

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.759
On the stairs, goin' high.

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:27.390
Shit!

01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:28.470
Go!

01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:35.310
Come on, come on!

01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.074
Hey! Hey.

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.549
Come on.

01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:08.676
The original V8 or a crate motor?

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:10.877
- Huh?
- Your Mustang.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.560
- Original V8 or crate motor?
- It's original. Original.

01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:16.233
That's cool.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.879
You know, we might need to rebuild it.

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:19.440
Who's "we"?

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:23.194
You see anyone else here? Huh?

01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:24.509
Me and you.

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.114
Now listen to me. Look at me!

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.589
We came up higher,
so we can jump out further.

01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:33.273
Okay? We're gonna jump over the fire.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.635
No.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:37.916
I can't.

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.399
Can't what? Rebuild an engine?

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.596
Jump.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.630
Trust me.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.120
We're not gonna hit the fire, you hear me?

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:48.236
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die.

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.310
- Look at me.
- I don't wanna die.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.516
- I don't wanna die.
- Our choice...

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:51.590
I don't wanna die.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.990
Our choice right now is to burn or jump.

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:55.150
- No, you let go of me!
- Okay!

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:58.392
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.630
- You jump.
- Okay.

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:00.915
Do what you want.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.673
You know what? I'ma do whatever you do.

01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:08.435
My wife's name is Felicia.

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.000
- And my daughter's Sydney.
- Don't put that on me!

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.595
And I will see them again.
Do you understand me?

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.752
What do you think the odds of you
gettin' off this rig alive are

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:18.036
if you don't jump with me right now?

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.152
I'm gettin' off this rig. You hear me?

01:26:20.240 --> 01:26:23.278
You wanna stay here? You stay here.

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.473
Hey, what color's the Mustang?

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.710
Let's go!

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:14.515
Andrea!

01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:14.798
If you hear your name, call out!

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.834
- Albers, Shane!
- Here!

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.151
Holloway, Caleb!

01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:23.270
Here!

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.911
Anderson, Jason!

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:34.434
Jason Anderson, are you here?

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:40.474
Is there anybody here
from the drill shack?

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.190
Nobody?

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.552
Donald Clark, are you here?

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.870
Dewey Revette?

01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:14.635
Shane Roshto?

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:18.200
Adam Weise?

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.036
Roy Kemp?

01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:28.919
We got a medic right up top, okay?

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.400
Dale Burkeen?

01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:39.159
Gordon Jones?

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:44.434
Karl Kleppinger?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.275
Stephen Curtis?

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:07.160
Keith Manuel.

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:08.469
Thank you.

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:14.959
You okay?

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:01.079
Everybody take a knee.

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:07.710
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.079
Thy will be done on Earth
as it is in heaven.

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:14.720
Give us this day, our daily bread.

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.598
Forgive us our trespasses,

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:19.798
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:23.271
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:51.790
What's your name, sir?

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:53.870
Mike Williams.

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:01.789
All right, you just need to get some rest,

01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:04.554
and when you do, after you're done,
you'll talk to me and...

01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.393
Hey, hey, hey. Were you on the rig?

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.352
- Yes, sir.
- My son get off the rig with you?

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:10.511
- Rig?
- Did he get off the rig?

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.239
I don't know if he made it off...

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:15.916
Where is my son?

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.832
- Did he get off the rig?
- I don't know.

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.234
My son.

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:26.880
Do you know him? Did he get off with you?

01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:29.031
Somebody better tell me something.

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:33.999
Somebody help me!

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:35.355
Please!

01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:41.391
...will trigger an alarm.

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.278
Did you hear any one of those alarms?

01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.119
Baby, it's okay.

01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:25.916
I remember closing my eyes
and... and saying a prayer.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.993
Asking God to tell my wife and little girl

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:31.356
that Daddy did everything he could.

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.114
And if I survive this, it's for a reason.

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.871
Please raise your right hand, sir.

01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:44.030
Do you solemnly swear

01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:46.430
that the testimony
you're about to give is the truth,

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:47.874
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:49.030
- so help you God?
- Yes, sir.

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:50.110
Thank you, sir.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.720
We went to the next light
that we saw in the water

01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:01.029
and retrieved that person,

01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:04.477
who was Andrea,
the dynamic position operator.

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.880
I went over to the PA
and made the last announcement

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:17.077
and said that we were abandoning the rig.

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:19.629
Who, in your view,
was in charge of the rig?

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:20.716
The OIM.

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.029
And that would be Mr. Harrell.

01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:23.520
- Is that correct?
- Correct.

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:28.879
There was a major explosion

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.556
followed by a second explosion
on the starboard side.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:35.036
So after explosion, I call the rig floor.

01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:36.600
No answer.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:47.594
All the things that they told us
could never happen happened.

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:49.160
Men lost their lives.
