A MOMENTARY MIX-UP
IN A MURDER TRIAL?

14:17.166 --> 14:19.875
- I MISSPOKE.

14:19.875 --> 14:21.834
- OH, FUCK.
- YOUR HONOR, THE WITNESS

14:21.834 --> 14:23.291
HAS JUST DEMONSTRATED
HOW UNRELIABLE HE IS

14:23.291 --> 14:24.500
IN A COURTROOM.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.500
I WOULD HAVE TO ASK

14:25.500 --> 14:27.458
HOW RELIABLE HIS WORK IS
IN THE LAB.

14:27.458 --> 14:28.917
OR ON A CRIME SCENE.

14:28.917 --> 14:31.333
MOREOVER, HOW RELIABLE
IS A POLICE DEPARTMENT

14:31.333 --> 14:34.125
THAT WOULD PLACE SO MUCH TRUST
IN HIS "EXPERT" OPINION?

14:43.208 --> 14:45.375
- I'M HALFWAY THROUGH
THE C.I. FILES YOU GAVE ME.

14:45.375 --> 14:47.875
- I WERE YOU,
I'D SPEND MORE TIME

14:47.875 --> 14:50.041
WITH THAT MAN OF YOURS
AND LESS TIME

14:50.041 --> 14:52.041
LOOKING FOR SOME
OLD CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT

14:52.041 --> 14:54.000
YOUR DADDY MIGHT'VE DIDDLED
BACK IN THE DAY.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.500
- I MEET ANOTHER ONE TOMORROW.

14:56.500 --> 14:59.333
MAYBE THEN I'LL FINALLY GET
SOME ANSWERS.

14:59.333 --> 15:00.750
- SAY YOU DO.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.083
THEN WHAT?

15:02.083 --> 15:06.041
- THEN...I'LL KNOW.

15:06.041 --> 15:10.583
THAT MY PERFECT FUCKING FATHER
WASN'T SO FUCKING PERFECT.

15:10.583 --> 15:12.583
- SO THAT'S WHAT,
THE MEANING OF LIFE?

15:12.583 --> 15:15.750
- THE MEANING OF MY LIFE.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.333
- HEY, BUDDY.

15:22.333 --> 15:24.000
GUESS WHERE I WAS YESTERDAY.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.542
- WELL, I'M NOT SURE, I...

15:26.542 --> 15:27.834
- I WAS AT A STORE.

15:27.834 --> 15:29.250
WANT TO TAKE A GUESS
WHAT KIND OF STORE?

15:29.250 --> 15:31.166
- I DON'T KNOW.
GROCERY?

15:31.166 --> 15:33.917
- CLOTHING. YOU KNOW ME,
I'M PRETTY INTO THAT SHIT.

15:33.917 --> 15:35.583
GOTTA COME CORRECT AND ALL.
BUT NOT YESTERDAY.

15:35.583 --> 15:36.875
- LOOK, IF THIS IS ABOUT--

15:36.875 --> 15:37.959
- COME ON, BUDDY.
LET ME FINISH.

15:37.959 --> 15:39.583
I WAS AT A STORE
HELPING A LADY PICK OUT

15:39.583 --> 15:40.875
A SUIT FOR HER SON.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.959
KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE HE HAD TO BE IN COURT.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.792
SEE THE GUY
WHO KILLED HIS OLD MAN.

15:44.792 --> 15:46.750
KID'S FIRST FUCKING SUIT.

15:46.750 --> 15:47.959
SOMETHING A FATHER
SHOULD BE DOING.

15:47.959 --> 15:49.625
- I'M SORRY.
- LITTLE LATE FOR "SORRY."

15:49.625 --> 15:51.333
THAT ASSHOLE YOU LET WALK?

15:51.333 --> 15:52.583
- BENITO GOMEZ.

15:52.583 --> 15:55.041
- AH, NOW YOU GET IT RIGHT.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.959
YOU ACTUALLY SEE
WHAT THAT FUCKHEAD DID?

15:56.959 --> 15:59.917
GOMEZ HIT THE KID'S OLD MAN
SO HARD,

15:59.917 --> 16:02.458
HIS CHEEKBONE BROKE,
PUSHING HIS EYEBALL UP

16:02.458 --> 16:03.625
AND OUT OF HIS FACE.

16:03.625 --> 16:05.166
THEN GOMEZ,
SWEETHEART THAT HE IS,

16:05.166 --> 16:06.458
KILLS THE GUY
IN FRONT OF HIS OWN SON.

16:06.458 --> 16:07.959
- I KNOW.
- HOW ABOUT THIS BEAUTY?

16:07.959 --> 16:09.709
GOMEZ DID FIVE YEARS
FOR BEATING HIS GIRLFRIEND

16:09.709 --> 16:11.792
SO BAD EVEN HER DENTIST
HAD A HARD TIME WITH THE I.D.

16:11.792 --> 16:13.667
SO IS YOUR "SORRY"
GONNA KEEP GOMEZ

16:13.667 --> 16:15.542
FROM POUNDING SOMEBODY ELSE
INTO THE NEXT WORLD?

16:15.542 --> 16:17.250
- JESUS, CHILL OUT, QUINN.

16:17.250 --> 16:19.792
- NO, DEB, HE'S RIGHT.
I SCREWED UP IN COURT TODAY.

16:19.792 --> 16:21.625
GOMEZ WALKED.
THIS ONE'S ON ME.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.125
- THANKS.
THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.

16:23.125 --> 16:24.792
WHY DON'T YOU HOLD ONTO THOSE
FOR ME, 'KAY, BUDDY?

16:24.792 --> 16:26.625
I'M SICK OF LOOKING AT 'EM.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.291
- YOU SCREWED UP?

16:28.291 --> 16:30.792
- BIG TIME.

16:30.792 --> 16:32.458
- SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

16:32.458 --> 16:34.250
- [sighs]

16:34.250 --> 16:36.959
NO, I'LL BE OKAY.

16:36.959 --> 16:40.125
MAYBE IT'S BENNY GOMEZ
WHO SHOULD BE WORRIED.

16:40.125 --> 16:44.125
- AND GOOD SOLVE
ON THE REYNOLDS CASE, GUYS.

16:44.125 --> 16:47.375
NEXT UP,
CHIEF'S OFFICE WANTS...

16:47.375 --> 16:49.333
- ANYTHING I CAN DO TO KEEP
THAT ANGRY IRISH OFF YOUR ASS,

16:49.333 --> 16:50.458
LET ME KNOW.

16:50.458 --> 16:53.000
- YOU'RE A REAL FRIEND, VINCE.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.667
[deep breath]

16:54.667 --> 16:56.166
QUINN'S A GOOD COP.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.041
I NEED A GOOD KILL.

16:58.041 --> 17:01.375
AND SOMETIMES ONE JUST FALLS
INTO YOUR LAP.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.875
- WE'VE GOT A BODY
IN KENDALL.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.291
MORGAN, QUINN, YOU'RE UP.

17:09.291 --> 17:10.375
AND DEXTER.
THERE'S BLOOD.

17:10.375 --> 17:11.792
LOTS OF BLOOD.

17:20.709 --> 17:22.125
- TALK ABOUT YOUR BLOODBATH.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.375
[chuckles]

17:25.375 --> 17:26.834
TOUGH ROOM.

17:26.834 --> 17:30.417
OKAY, FEMORAL ARTERY SEVERED.
SHE BLED OUT IN MINUTES.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.709
- SUICIDE?
- NO WEAPON ON THE PREMISES.

17:32.709 --> 17:35.041
- EXACTLY. THE CORONER CAN SUCK
MY UNCIRCUMCISED DICK

17:35.041 --> 17:36.250
IF HE DOESN'T RULE THIS
A HOMICIDE.

17:36.250 --> 17:39.208
- THAT'S WAY T.M.I.,
MASUKA.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.542
EMPLOYMENT RECORDS SHOW SHE JUST
GOT PROMOTED TO SOUS CHEF.

17:41.542 --> 17:43.583
- A TOTAL BABE.
AND SHE COULD COOK.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.250
HAD IT ALL GOING ON.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.083
- THEN THIS.

17:47.083 --> 17:49.375
- IT'S A VERY WELL-ORGANIZED
CRIME SCENE.

17:49.375 --> 17:52.125
THE ASSAILANT TOOK HIS TIME.

17:52.125 --> 17:55.291
CLEANED UP AFTER HIMSELF.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.667
OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T HAVE KIDS.

17:56.667 --> 17:58.709
- KEEP AN EYE
ON OUR EXPERT WITNESS.

17:58.709 --> 18:01.375
IN CASE OUR GIRL'S PARENTS
ACTUALLY WANT TO SEE

18:01.375 --> 18:03.208
SOMEONE GO TO JAIL FOR DOING
THIS TO THEIR DAUGHTER.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.083
- HARSH.

18:08.083 --> 18:11.208
[chatter over police radio]

18:14.625 --> 18:16.792
- CHRISTINE HILL,
BROWARD JOURNAL DISPATCH.

18:16.792 --> 18:17.959
- AND?

18:17.959 --> 18:20.667
- AND WAS MS. BELL
THE ONLY VICTIM?

18:20.667 --> 18:22.834
- WHO GAVE YOU HER NAME?

18:22.834 --> 18:24.625
- I SEARCHED THE ADDRESS

18:24.625 --> 18:26.250
ON THIS THING
CALLED THE INTERNET.

18:26.250 --> 18:28.542
NOW, WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THE MURDER?

18:28.542 --> 18:29.792
SUSPECTS?

18:29.792 --> 18:31.917
- MURDER? SUSPECTS?

18:31.917 --> 18:33.750
WE STILL HAVEN'T OFFICIALLY
RULED OUT SUICIDE.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.542
- SO IT WAS PILLS?

18:35.542 --> 18:36.625
- NO.

18:36.625 --> 18:39.417
- THEN SHE BLED OUT.

18:39.417 --> 18:41.667
WOMEN PRETTY MUCH
ONLY DO ONE OR THE OTHER.

18:41.667 --> 18:42.875
- DO ME A FAVOR.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.291
YOU BREAK THIS CASE
BEFORE WE DO, GIVE ME A CALL.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.625

WHEN THINGS ARE GOING GOOD,

19:34.500 --> 19:36.625
I THINK THAT'S GOD'S WAY
OF SAYING TO COVER YOUR ASS,

19:36.625 --> 19:39.083
BECAUSE SOMETHING'S GONNA
JUMP UP AND BITE IT, HARD.

19:39.083 --> 19:41.041

19:48.166 --> 19:49.667

JUST MAKING YOURSELF CRAZY?

19:49.667 --> 19:51.458
- THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I DO.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.166
WHAT?

19:55.166 --> 19:56.792
- IT'S JUST

19:56.792 --> 19:57.667
1,000 TIMES BEFORE.

19:57.667 --> 19:58.834

19:58.834 --> 20:00.041

20:05.667 --> 20:06.709

20:23.333 --> 20:25.500
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
A CUBAN RESTAURANT MATTERS?

20:27.792 --> 20:29.166

39:17.208 --> 39:18.709
WE'VE HAD, LIKE,
ZERO TIME TOGETHER.

39:18.709 --> 39:20.041
- YEAH.

39:20.041 --> 39:22.792

39:27.250 --> 39:31.208

WELL, JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES.

39:34.709 --> 39:37.000

A POWER NAP.

39:37.000 --> 39:38.542
- OKAY, OPEN.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.875

40:47.417 --> 40:49.458
DADDY KILLS PEOPLE.

40:52.625 --> 40:54.208
WELL, BAD PEOPLE.

40:56.875 --> 40:59.125
NOT REALLY ANYBODY ELSE
I CAN TELL ABOUT THAT,

40:59.125 --> 41:00.625
YOU KNOW?

41:08.375 --> 41:10.750
DADDY'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
BUDDY.

41:14.917 --> 41:16.333
I'VE ALREADY LOST
MY INNOCENCE.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.333
I'M NOT GOING
TO SACRIFICE YOURS TOO.

41:31.834 --> 41:33.667
TRIPLE RED-EYE, PLEASE.

41:33.667 --> 41:35.125

41:36.458 --> 41:38.083
AND YOU'RE TEMPTING
THE HEART GODS.

41:38.083 --> 41:40.875

41:48.583 --> 41:51.500
FRONT PAGE.
NICE.

41:51.500 --> 41:52.458

41:52.458 --> 41:53.750
MY EDITOR OKAYED A FOLLOW-UP.

41:53.750 --> 41:55.000
YOU GOT ANYTHING FOR ME?

41:55.000 --> 41:56.750

BUT I GOT NOTHING.

41:56.750 --> 41:58.959
- HMM.

41:58.959 --> 42:01.208
WE, UH,

42:01.208 --> 42:02.792
- WHAT KIND OF FISH?

42:04.041 --> 42:05.875
OFF THE RECORD.

42:05.875 --> 42:07.500
- YOU KNOW THOSE PRICKS

42:07.500 --> 42:08.500
WHO'VE BEEN
SHAKING DOWN TOURISTS?

42:08.500 --> 42:10.166
- THE VACATION ROBBERS?

42:10.166 --> 42:11.500
- NO, THE VACATION MURDERERS.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.917
THEY SHOT SOME POOR NEWLYWED.
DIDN'T MAKE IT.

42:13.917 --> 42:17.333
SO...WE'RE MORE THAN
A LITTLE DISTRACTED.

42:18.750 --> 42:20.417
- YOU WANT
ANOTHER DISTRACTION,

42:20.417 --> 42:21.709
I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOU OUT
FOR A DRINK.

42:21.709 --> 42:25.625
YOU KNOW, TO THANK YOU

FROM OUR BATHROOM DO-OVER.

42:42.291 --> 42:43.375
- DID YOU RUN IT THROUGH
THE DATABASE?

42:43.375 --> 42:44.542
- NO POINT.

42:44.542 --> 42:45.709
THE BLOOD YOU SWABBED
SHOWED SHIT-ALL

42:45.709 --> 42:46.834
ON THE DNA FRONT.

42:46.834 --> 42:48.208
OUR CHANCES OF FINDING OUT
WHO IT BELONGS TO

42:48.208 --> 42:50.750
ARE ABOUT, OH,

WHY?

42:57.583 --> 42:59.375
- WELL...

42:59.375 --> 43:01.959
IF THE DNA WON'T TELL US
WHO IT BELONGED TO,

43:01.959 --> 43:03.208
MAYBE THE ADDRESS WILL.

43:03.208 --> 43:05.166
- 1578 GLENCOE.

43:05.166 --> 43:07.875

FOUND IN THE BATHTUB.

43:17.917 --> 43:18.959
- BLED OUT.

43:18.959 --> 43:20.291
INCISION TO HER THIGH.

43:20.291 --> 43:22.792
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF THAT?

43:22.792 --> 43:25.959
- WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF WHAT?

43:25.959 --> 43:27.125
- SPECIAL AGENT LUNDY.

43:27.125 --> 43:29.792
- VINCENT MASUKA,
IF MEMORY SERVES.

43:29.792 --> 43:32.625
- THAT'S RIGHT.

43:32.625 --> 43:35.250
L.F.I. ON THE B.H.B.

43:35.250 --> 43:37.250
- HEH.
- YOU'RE WORKING A CASE, RIGHT?

43:37.250 --> 43:38.583
FEDS NEED US TO--

43:38.583 --> 43:40.250

43:42.333 --> 43:45.083

43:45.083 --> 43:47.041
AND GET THE WRITE-UP
ON NOONAN.

43:47.041 --> 43:49.792
JUST DOING MY JOB.

43:54.709 --> 43:56.375
- HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

43:56.375 --> 43:58.125
- ABOUT?

43:58.125 --> 43:59.542
- WHY I'M IN MIAMI.

43:59.542 --> 44:01.291
IT IS A CASE.

44:01.291 --> 44:03.834
- YEAH, I FIGURED.

44:03.834 --> 44:05.542
BUT WHY DO YOU NEED ME?

44:05.542 --> 44:07.208
YOU HAVE THE FULL RESOURCES
OF THE FBI.

44:07.208 --> 44:09.125
- NOT ANYMORE.

44:09.125 --> 44:10.834
I'M RETIRED.

44:10.834 --> 44:13.125

44:21.792 --> 44:23.750
THE ONE TWISTED
SON OF A BITCH WHO GOT AWAY.

44:23.750 --> 44:27.750
- SO WHO IS
THE TWISTED SON OF A BITCH?

44:27.750 --> 44:30.458
- I CALL HIM
THE TRINITY KILLER.

44:30.458 --> 44:32.834

44:32.834 --> 44:35.500

THE COUNTRY FOR YEARS.

44:35.500 --> 44:38.500
PROBLEM IS,
I CAN'T PROVE HE EXISTS.

44:38.500 --> 44:41.041
LAW ENFORCEMENT
DOESN'T TALK TO EACH OTHER.

44:41.041 --> 44:43.709
SO NO ONE AT THE FBI
IS EVEN ON BOARD.

44:45.166 --> 44:46.417
JUST ME.

44:46.417 --> 44:48.166

WAS THE SITE
OF A VERY SIMILAR HOMICIDE

45:19.458 --> 45:21.458
30 YEARS AGO.

45:21.458 --> 45:23.083

47:00.542 --> 47:01.542
- I NEVER HAD ANY DOUBT.

47:01.542 --> 47:03.583
- [small laugh]

47:05.667 --> 47:08.041
SO HOW LONG
WILL YOUR FORWARD MOMENTUM

47:08.041 --> 47:09.333
KEEP YOU IN MIAMI?

47:09.333 --> 47:11.834

- I HAD BENNY GOMEZ ON THE ROPES
AND LET HIM SLIP AWAY.

48:10.458 --> 48:12.750
NO WAY I CAN GO
TO THAT BAR AGAIN.

48:12.750 --> 48:15.375
OFFICER ALPHABET
MADE SURE OF THAT.

48:15.375 --> 48:17.583
WHICH MEANS I GRAB BENNY
WHERE HE LIVES.

48:17.583 --> 48:20.834
A HIGHER DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY,
BUT I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
