<i>ariel:
onomatopoeia.</i>

00:02.724 --> 00:03.658
<i>bridgette:
what a dumb word.</i>

00:03.726 --> 00:05.460
<i>i didn't ask you
to judge it.</i>

00:05.527 --> 00:07.161
I asked you
to spell it.

00:07.229 --> 00:09.497
Well, that doesn't change
the fact that it's a dumb word.

00:09.565 --> 00:12.400
I mean, you gotta wonder
what was going on in the room

00:12.468 --> 00:14.435
The day they needed
to make up that word.

00:14.503 --> 00:15.670
(chuckles)

00:15.738 --> 00:17.505
Is there really a room
where they do that?

00:17.573 --> 00:19.407
There's got to be. right?

00:19.475 --> 00:21.476
Just spell it.

00:21.543 --> 00:25.279
O-n...

00:25.347 --> 00:26.948
There's more.

00:27.016 --> 00:28.149
(air horn blares twice)

00:28.217 --> 00:29.517
Thank you, mr. truck!

00:32.421 --> 00:33.721
I don't understand.

00:33.789 --> 00:36.090
What's he honking at me for?

00:36.158 --> 00:37.825
(air horn blares twice)

00:37.893 --> 00:39.627
It's a red light!

00:39.695 --> 00:41.329
I don't control it.

00:41.397 --> 00:42.764
I'll turn when it changes!

00:42.831 --> 00:45.199
(air horn blares twice)

00:45.267 --> 00:46.968
(truck engine revs,
car horn blares)

00:47.036 --> 00:48.102
Ah, excellent.

00:48.170 --> 00:49.337
(both horns blare)

00:49.405 --> 00:51.673
(truck engine revving)

00:52.741 --> 00:55.543
Hey! hey!
hey, what's going on?

00:55.611 --> 00:56.711
Hey.

01:00.082 --> 01:01.482
Stop! stop!

01:02.751 --> 01:04.185
(tires screeching)

01:04.253 --> 01:05.687
Ariel, do something!

01:05.754 --> 01:06.688
Stop! stop!

01:06.755 --> 01:07.689
(car horns honking)

01:07.756 --> 01:08.990
(shrieks)
stop!

01:09.058 --> 01:10.858
(horn blaring)

01:10.926 --> 01:13.494
(gasps)

01:13.562 --> 01:16.998
(sighs)

01:17.066 --> 01:19.300
Talk to me.

01:19.368 --> 01:22.003
I just hate it
that she can drive.

01:22.071 --> 01:23.471
Ariel?

01:23.539 --> 01:26.307
What are you talking about?
she's a really good driver.

01:26.375 --> 01:27.875
I know.

01:27.943 --> 01:31.579
She doesn't take any big streets
to school, does she?

01:31.647 --> 01:33.114
I don't think she can take
any really big streets

01:33.182 --> 01:34.549
On the way to school.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.117
<i>i don't think there are
any really big streets</i>

01:36.185 --> 01:37.685
On the way to school.

01:37.753 --> 01:39.287
I don't think there's
even a stoplight

01:39.354 --> 01:40.888
On the way to school.

01:40.956 --> 01:43.725
Come on. allison, come on.

01:43.792 --> 01:45.059
It's 4:00 in the morning.

01:45.127 --> 01:46.394
You worked late.

01:46.462 --> 01:48.329
You only got home
an hour and a half ago.

01:48.397 --> 01:50.131
I'm sure it's just
a really bad dream.

01:50.199 --> 01:52.333
Please. come on.
go back to sleep.

01:52.401 --> 01:54.001
You're right.

01:54.069 --> 01:56.504
She couldn't go faster
than 20 miles an hour

01:56.572 --> 01:57.672
Even if she wanted to.

01:57.740 --> 01:59.440
There's a stop sign
on every corner.

01:59.508 --> 02:01.542
Exactly.

02:01.610 --> 02:04.979
Come on. you need some rest.
we both do.

02:08.817 --> 02:11.586
It's easy for you to say.

02:14.523 --> 02:16.190
(phone rings)

02:21.396 --> 02:22.797
Hello?

02:22.865 --> 02:26.567
Man:
hello. i'm looking for
an allison dubois.

02:26.635 --> 02:27.869
This is allison dubois.

02:27.936 --> 02:29.370
May i ask who's calling?

02:29.438 --> 02:31.272
I'm with the phoenix pd.

02:31.340 --> 02:32.707
Are you the owner

02:32.775 --> 02:35.643
Of a 1991 volvo station wagon,
dark cream?

02:35.711 --> 02:37.211
Is something the matter?

02:37.279 --> 02:39.046
Did you lend the vehicle
to anyone?

02:39.114 --> 02:41.149
Is it possible it's been stolen?

02:41.216 --> 02:43.317
My daughter.
my daughter has it.

02:43.385 --> 02:45.720
Why are you asking
all these questions?

02:45.788 --> 02:48.923
There's been an accident.

Ariel:
mom?!

03:45.108 --> 03:48.310
They just came in the class
and told me what happened.

03:48.378 --> 03:50.412
Joe:
hey.

03:51.447 --> 03:53.949
I had to park
three blocks away.

03:54.017 --> 03:55.917
Were you here when
this happened?

03:55.985 --> 03:57.452
No. i had no idea.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.821
They just, uh, they just
pulled me out of class.

03:59.889 --> 04:01.823
You folks the owners
of the parked car?

04:01.891 --> 04:02.891
The wagon, yeah?

04:02.959 --> 04:04.459
The girl who was
doing the driving

04:04.527 --> 04:06.762
Said she recognized
your daughter from school.

04:10.299 --> 04:11.900
Oh, yeah, i've-i've
seen her around.

04:11.968 --> 04:14.770
I think she's, um,
a year behind me.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.171
Apparently, she has
her learner's permit,

04:16.238 --> 04:18.673
So mom let her get behind
the wheel to drive to school.

04:18.741 --> 04:19.908
She was driving
down this street

04:19.976 --> 04:21.375
Looking for a place
to pull over

04:21.444 --> 04:22.911
And a cat
crossed the road.

04:22.979 --> 04:24.846
I guess she tried
to hit the brake,

04:24.914 --> 04:26.982
Hit the gas instead, panicked,
jerked the steering wheel,

04:27.050 --> 04:28.917
Went across the road
and plowed into your car.

04:28.985 --> 04:30.886
It's pretty
cut-and-dry.

04:30.953 --> 04:32.854
Nobody hurt.
really about tow trucks

04:32.922 --> 04:35.490
And insurance companies
at this point.

04:35.558 --> 04:36.558
Thank you.

04:36.626 --> 04:37.726
Okay, thanks.
thank you.

04:37.794 --> 04:38.927
Mr. and mrs. dubois,

04:38.995 --> 04:41.563
I'm lauren portman.
i'm jamie's mom.

04:41.631 --> 04:44.199
And i could not be
sorrier about this.

04:44.267 --> 04:46.535
Uh, well, you know,
the good news is

04:46.602 --> 04:49.471
That, you know, none
of the kids were hurt, so...

04:49.539 --> 04:50.706
I'm joe dubois.

04:50.773 --> 04:52.174
This is my wife allison.
this is ariel.

04:52.241 --> 04:53.475
Hi.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.609
Hi. and you're right,

04:54.677 --> 04:56.578
That is the most
important thing.

04:56.646 --> 04:58.180
She's actually a
good little driver.

04:58.247 --> 05:00.382
I just think, you know,
being late for school

05:00.450 --> 05:01.883
And that cat...
mom, it's okay.

05:01.951 --> 05:04.886
So, um, i guess
this is the part

05:04.954 --> 05:07.122
Where we exchange the
insurance information.

05:07.190 --> 05:09.524
Right.

05:09.592 --> 05:11.426
Of course, we are
completely at fault.

05:11.494 --> 05:14.262
And i promise i
will make that clear

05:14.330 --> 05:16.364
To the insurance company
when i call them.

05:16.432 --> 05:18.533
My husband has his-- thanks--

05:18.601 --> 05:22.904
His, uh, car here
if you need a ride somewhere.

05:22.972 --> 05:24.506
Oh, no, we're fine.
you know how it is.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.610
As long as the kids are
fine, everything's fine.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.752
Okay, i'll ask.

05:36.819 --> 05:39.121
What about any of this
is making you happy?

05:39.188 --> 05:40.388
What makes you think
i'm happy?

05:40.456 --> 05:41.656
Look at that.

05:41.724 --> 05:43.692
You got that goofy
grin on your face.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.094
You know that that
car of yours is

05:46.162 --> 05:47.662
Pretty long
in the tooth.

05:47.730 --> 05:49.498
I mean, i'm not
even sure

05:49.565 --> 05:52.033
The insurance company is gonna
want to pay us to get it fixed.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.468
They might just want
to write you a check

05:53.536 --> 05:55.370
And, you know,
total the thing

05:55.438 --> 05:57.372
And be done with it.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.907
Well, they have to fix it,
don't they?

05:58.975 --> 06:02.477
No, not if it costs more
than the car's worth.

06:02.545 --> 06:04.179
Well, it's like
that lady said,

06:04.247 --> 06:06.948
As long as the kids
are fine...

06:07.016 --> 06:08.049
You love that car.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.584
Yeah, i do,
but you know

06:09.652 --> 06:11.419
About that horrible dream
i had last night.

06:11.487 --> 06:14.556
The one where ariel and the kids
were killed in the car

06:14.624 --> 06:17.259
On the way to school?
so, it can't happen now.

06:17.326 --> 06:19.427
There's no car
for it to happen in.

06:19.495 --> 06:21.029
Aha.

06:21.097 --> 06:24.099
Ah, capisce. mm.

06:24.167 --> 06:27.102
Well, we may be getting
ahead of ourselves.

06:27.170 --> 06:28.336
We still gotta wait

06:28.404 --> 06:30.739
To hear from the body
shop and the adjusters.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.208
Oh, hey, by the way, was there
anything in that dream

06:33.276 --> 06:35.076
About how we're supposed
to pay for whatever it is

06:35.144 --> 06:36.845
We buy to replace the
car that you love

06:36.913 --> 06:41.016
But that you're now
convinced is a death trap?

06:41.884 --> 06:43.418
Take that as a no.

06:43.486 --> 06:46.154
You sure you're okay with
me just dropping you off

06:46.222 --> 06:47.355
At the car rental place?

06:47.423 --> 06:49.191
You don't want me to
go in there with you?

06:49.258 --> 06:51.526
Oh, please,
i know how to rent a car.

06:51.594 --> 06:52.794
I can rent a car.

06:52.862 --> 06:54.162
I'm not... okay.

06:54.230 --> 06:55.430
(chuckles)

06:57.033 --> 06:59.401
Sorry, ma'am,
but it's after 10:00.

06:59.468 --> 07:02.470
I'm afraid your options
are gonna be pretty limited.

07:02.538 --> 07:04.606
In fact, i'm showing
that we have nothing.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.308
Are you serious?
(chuckles)

07:06.375 --> 07:09.044
My husband just
dropped me off.

07:09.111 --> 07:10.312
I've no way of
getting home.

07:10.379 --> 07:11.446
You know what?

07:11.514 --> 07:13.315
Let's go out there
and take a look.

07:17.987 --> 07:19.921
That's it?

07:19.989 --> 07:22.524
Kinda looks like
more than i need.

07:22.592 --> 07:24.025
Rental agent:
wow. i don't even see
it on the manifest.

07:24.093 --> 07:25.493
Must have just
come back in.

07:25.561 --> 07:27.529
You want me to clean it up?
(cell phone rings)

07:27.597 --> 07:29.698
Everything okay, ma'am?

07:29.765 --> 07:31.066
I'm sorry.
somebody from work.

07:31.133 --> 07:32.334
They want me
to meet them.

07:32.401 --> 07:34.035
Do you know where
thunderhead pass is?

07:34.103 --> 07:36.471
No, but that's okay.
this guy's got a nav system.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.173
Hell, these terrains have
everything in them.

07:38.241 --> 07:40.175
Do you want me to clean it up?

07:40.243 --> 07:43.044
Actually, maybe i'll just
take it the way it is.

07:50.586 --> 07:52.587
(horn honking)

08:04.600 --> 08:05.767
Nice wheels.

08:05.835 --> 08:06.968
It's a rental.

08:07.036 --> 08:08.670
My car's in the shop.
don't ask.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.006
Okay, i won't.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.575
I appreciate you driving out
to the middle of nowhere.

08:13.643 --> 08:15.277
I'm kind of dealing with
a head-scratcher here,

08:15.344 --> 08:18.647
And i suddenly thought that
this might be up your alley.

08:18.714 --> 08:22.284
A big telecommunications company
has cell phone towers out here.

08:22.351 --> 08:23.752
And the guy in charge
of maintaining them

08:23.819 --> 08:26.688
Was driving along the
access road this morning

08:26.756 --> 08:28.857
When he noticed this.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.926
Somebody set off

08:30.993 --> 08:33.094
Some kind of explosive
device here last night.

08:33.162 --> 08:35.530
The question is, what for?

08:35.597 --> 08:38.265
Was it just a prank or could
it have been a dress rehearsal

08:38.333 --> 08:39.668
For something to come?

08:39.735 --> 08:41.937
I was out here all morning
with the forensics boys

08:42.004 --> 08:43.905
And all we found were a
bunch of tiny shards.

08:43.972 --> 08:46.341
Some metal,
some plastic.

08:46.409 --> 08:47.809
I was hoping you could
help me figure out

08:47.877 --> 08:49.811
Whether this was just someone
getting their jollies on

08:49.879 --> 08:51.513
Or if it's actually something
we should be concerned about.

08:51.580 --> 08:53.014
(police radio buzzes on)

08:53.082 --> 08:54.916
Man (over radio):
hq to detective scanlon.
what's your 20?

08:54.984 --> 08:56.518
They always call when
you're nowhere near the car.

08:56.585 --> 08:58.219
(laughs)

09:08.164 --> 09:10.198
<i>man:
one, two,</i>

09:10.266 --> 09:14.436
Three, four, five, six,

09:14.503 --> 09:17.072
Seven, eight, nine,

09:17.139 --> 09:21.309
Ten, 11, 12, 13, 14,

09:21.377 --> 09:26.481
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

09:26.549 --> 09:28.483
21, 22.

09:33.756 --> 09:35.757
Twenty-two.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.478
(beeping)

09:56.545 --> 09:58.346
(beeping slowly)

10:01.217 --> 10:02.851
(beeping rapidly)

10:02.918 --> 10:05.020
(explosion echoes)

10:09.291 --> 10:11.192
Scanlon:
you all right?

10:11.260 --> 10:13.895
Yeah, i'm fine.

10:13.963 --> 10:16.831
Well, i think i can tell you
what happened here.

10:16.899 --> 10:21.102
I can't really explain it,
but i can describe it.

10:22.271 --> 10:23.438
(ringing)

10:23.506 --> 10:24.773
Uh...

10:27.410 --> 10:28.576
Hello?

10:28.644 --> 10:29.844
Joe:
i was just calling to see

10:29.912 --> 10:31.446
How things went
at the rental place.

10:31.514 --> 10:33.048
Well, it went fine.

10:33.115 --> 10:35.016
Uh, i ended up with something
a little fancier

10:35.084 --> 10:37.819
Than i'd normally go for,
but it was all they had.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.454
This is kind of cool, though.

10:39.522 --> 10:41.656
I'm talking to you
through the car speakers.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.158
That's actually
called bluetooth, al.

10:43.225 --> 10:44.559
It's been around for years.

10:44.627 --> 10:46.361
Listen, um,

10:46.429 --> 10:47.796
I don't want to freak you out,

10:47.863 --> 10:49.264
But the buttons
on the car door--

10:49.331 --> 10:51.032
They make the windows
go up and down.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.434
You're very funny.

10:52.501 --> 10:54.102
You're very comical.

10:54.170 --> 10:56.905
Actually, there's all kinds
of gizmos in here,

10:56.972 --> 10:59.174
And i'm going to have
to figure them out for myself.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.975
Okay. i'll call you later?

11:01.043 --> 11:02.310
Call you later.

11:02.378 --> 11:04.045
(beep)

11:06.182 --> 11:08.049
Woman (over radio):
this is satellite traffic
for boston.

11:08.117 --> 11:09.551
We're looking
at bumper-to-bumper traf...

11:09.618 --> 11:12.320
Man:
you're listening
to satellite traffic for denver.

11:12.388 --> 11:13.621
Major...

11:13.689 --> 11:15.690
(woman speaking over radio
in portuguese)

11:17.726 --> 11:19.727
(song plays in foreign language)

11:22.698 --> 11:24.632
(turns up volume)

11:33.843 --> 11:35.777
Man (over radio):
are you sure?

11:35.845 --> 11:36.911
I mean, really sure?

11:36.979 --> 11:38.379
Like, we can call
my parents, sure?

11:38.447 --> 11:41.149
Woman:
i can't be positive,
but i took four

11:41.217 --> 11:43.618
Of those take-home tests,
and they all were.

11:43.686 --> 11:45.753
(couple laughing excitedly)

11:47.123 --> 11:48.456
Man:
we're having a baby?

11:48.524 --> 11:50.258
We're having a baby.

11:50.326 --> 11:51.326
(woman laughing)

11:51.393 --> 11:52.360
(horn honking)

11:52.428 --> 11:54.129
Oh!

11:54.196 --> 11:56.197
(radio switches back to music)

12:05.107 --> 12:07.108
(turns volume up)

12:07.176 --> 12:09.844
(music cuts out,
couple argues in spanish)

12:15.518 --> 12:17.018
(radio switches back to music)

12:26.328 --> 12:27.862
(music cuts out)

12:27.930 --> 12:29.397
Man (over radio):
don't kill me, okay?

12:29.465 --> 12:31.466
Man 2:
you need to stop crying.
people can see.

12:31.534 --> 12:33.902
You need to pull
yourself together.

12:33.969 --> 12:35.637
The light's green. go.

12:35.704 --> 12:37.572
(man whimpering)

12:40.042 --> 12:42.143
I'm sorry.
i think it's the gun.

12:42.211 --> 12:43.344
Uh...

12:43.412 --> 12:45.346
Seeing it-it... it make...

12:45.414 --> 12:46.648
It's making me shake.

12:46.715 --> 12:49.984
I... i can barely hold
the steering wheel.

12:55.691 --> 12:58.459
Look, if it's the car,
i'll give it to you.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.727
(man panting)

12:59.795 --> 13:01.196
I'll... i'll just get out,

13:01.263 --> 13:05.066
And you can get behind the wheel
and drive away.

13:05.134 --> 13:06.668
(man groaning)

13:07.937 --> 13:09.637
(man whimpering)

13:09.705 --> 13:11.639
That gun in my... my side...

13:11.707 --> 13:13.641
Just please don't kill me.

13:13.709 --> 13:14.709
Just don't...

13:14.777 --> 13:17.212
My god, don't kill me, okay?

13:17.279 --> 13:19.347
I beg... don't...

13:19.415 --> 13:23.618
(radio switches back to music)

13:26.683 --> 13:29.051
woman (over radio):
meanwhile, in washington
earlier today,

13:29.119 --> 13:30.186
Congressional leaders...

13:30.254 --> 13:32.054
Man:
and, over on the hardwood...

13:32.122 --> 13:36.192
I'm telling you, i heard
someone being kidnapped.

13:36.260 --> 13:37.960
It wasn't doing
that this morning.

13:38.028 --> 13:40.029
This morning, i could hear
other people's conversations.

13:40.097 --> 13:42.098
I could see them
talking in their car,

13:42.166 --> 13:44.033
And i could hear
them in here.

13:44.101 --> 13:46.102
(sighs)
well, it's not doing it now.

13:46.170 --> 13:47.904
Well, i know it's
not doing it now.

13:47.971 --> 13:49.772
Um, i don't know
what to tell you, al.

13:49.840 --> 13:50.840
Maybe the
satellite radio

13:50.908 --> 13:52.408
Was picking up
cell phone signals.

13:52.476 --> 13:54.310
They weren't talking
on their cell phones.

13:54.378 --> 13:56.579
They were talking to each
other-- i could see them.

13:56.647 --> 13:58.114
Well, you called
detective scanlon,

13:58.182 --> 13:59.849
And you described
the vehicle, right?

13:59.917 --> 14:01.184
A blue pickup.

14:01.251 --> 14:03.519
Well, i think it's out
of your hands, then.

14:03.587 --> 14:05.922
I think you've done
all that you can.

14:05.989 --> 14:08.357
I got to head inside, al.

14:09.393 --> 14:12.028
You know, i promised
that woman whose, uh,

14:12.095 --> 14:13.896
Daughter ran into your car
that i'd call her

14:13.964 --> 14:15.765
The moment that we heard
from her insurance company.

14:15.833 --> 14:17.200
Um, you're welcome
to come with me.

14:17.267 --> 14:19.669
Or, if you'd rather just listen
to what we have to say,

14:19.736 --> 14:21.604
You could always just
turn on your car radio.

14:22.639 --> 14:24.607
Jerk.

14:24.675 --> 14:26.242
<i>woman:
good morning.</i>

14:26.310 --> 14:27.877
How may i help you today?

14:27.945 --> 14:30.213
Man:
i need you to give me
all of your money.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.515
Please, i don't have
a lot of time.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.383
I need you
to fill these two bags.

14:34.451 --> 14:36.118
I'm sorry--
i know i'm scaring you--

14:36.186 --> 14:38.788
But i need you to do
exactly as i tell you,

14:38.856 --> 14:42.058
Or everyone in this bank
is going to die.

14:42.125 --> 14:43.659
(gasps)

14:43.727 --> 14:45.928
<i>you've reached the cell phone
of detective lee scanlon.</i>

14:45.996 --> 14:48.531
<i>if this is an emergency,
dial 911.</i>

14:48.599 --> 14:50.733
If not, leave a message
after the beep.

14:50.801 --> 14:51.834
(beep)

14:51.902 --> 14:53.269
Hey, lee, it's allison again.

14:53.337 --> 14:55.338
Look, i've been trying
to get a hold of you

14:55.405 --> 14:56.806
Since 4:00 in the morning.

14:56.874 --> 14:58.241
I'm on my way to the office.

14:58.308 --> 15:00.343
Can you give me a call
when you get this?

15:00.410 --> 15:01.744
(electronic chiming)
uh, uh...

15:01.812 --> 15:05.381
Uh, lee, um, i think i'm getting
another call.

15:05.449 --> 15:07.650
Uh, if i lose you, i'm sorry.

15:07.718 --> 15:09.218
I'm just kind of new to this.

15:09.286 --> 15:10.653
(beep)
hello?

15:10.721 --> 15:11.787
Allison, it's lee.

15:11.855 --> 15:13.689
You been trying
to get a hold of me?

15:13.757 --> 15:15.391
Uh, yeah, i... i have.

15:15.459 --> 15:18.160
Look, i had a dream last night
about a... a bank robbery.

15:18.228 --> 15:20.796
Well, then, you just may
be batting two for two.

15:20.864 --> 15:22.598
What are you talking about?

15:22.666 --> 15:25.301
I'm standing outside the main
branch of mariposa national.

15:25.369 --> 15:27.069
Some guy walked in here
45 minutes ago

15:27.137 --> 15:28.437
And tried to rob the place.

15:28.505 --> 15:29.805
Teller hit the silent alarm.

15:29.873 --> 15:32.074
We think he's got 18 hostages
in there, and of course,

15:32.142 --> 15:33.809
We've got every cop
in phoenix out here.

15:33.877 --> 15:35.778
But here's the part
i thought you'd like.

15:35.846 --> 15:38.648
Turns out our bank robber showed
up in a blue pickup truck.

15:38.715 --> 15:40.449
Lee, he's got a bomb.

15:40.517 --> 15:41.684
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
say that again.

15:41.752 --> 15:42.752
A bomb.

15:42.819 --> 15:43.920
He's wearing a bomb.

15:43.987 --> 15:45.788
You have to get everyone out
of that bank.

15:45.856 --> 15:48.057
You've got to get someone
from the bomb squad over there.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.092
Okay, i'm on it.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.595
(siren wailing,
helicopter blades whirring)

15:52.663 --> 15:53.829
Lieutenant wilkes,
this is that woman

15:53.897 --> 15:54.864
I was telling you about.

15:54.932 --> 15:56.666
Allison, this is
patrick wilkes,

15:56.733 --> 15:58.200
The best bomb man
in the southwest.

15:58.268 --> 15:59.402
So, you've seen it?

15:59.469 --> 16:00.670
The bomb?

16:00.737 --> 16:02.271
I think so. yeah.

16:02.339 --> 16:05.041
It... it was strapped to
his body, kind of like a vest.

16:05.108 --> 16:07.443
And it had, uh,
all those padlocks on it.

16:07.511 --> 16:09.245
You see any wires?

16:09.313 --> 16:10.980
Wires?
lots of wires.

16:11.048 --> 16:13.983
And, uh, there were bricks--
like clay.

16:14.051 --> 16:16.919
And for what it's worth,
he seemed genuinely scared.

16:16.987 --> 16:19.722
Almost as if he...
he didn't want to be there.

16:19.790 --> 16:22.558
Almost as if,
uh, it wasn't his idea.

16:24.027 --> 16:26.095
What?

16:26.163 --> 16:27.630
The bank robber's been
on the phone

16:27.698 --> 16:28.998
With the hostage
negotiator.

16:29.066 --> 16:31.067
He claims someone forced him
to do what he's doing.

16:31.134 --> 16:33.536
Says a guy in a ski mask
climbed into his truck yesterday

16:33.604 --> 16:34.804
And held him at gunpoint.

16:34.871 --> 16:36.806
Made him drive to some kind
of trailer workshop,

16:36.873 --> 16:38.574
Where he and another man
locked this bomb--

16:38.642 --> 16:40.042
Which i guess is this vest thing

16:40.110 --> 16:41.644
You're talking about--
onto his body.

16:41.712 --> 16:43.179
Well, i think
he's telling the truth.

16:43.246 --> 16:44.580
And that explosion
in the desert--

16:44.648 --> 16:46.048
I think it's all part of this.

16:46.116 --> 16:47.950
It must have been a test.

16:48.018 --> 16:50.386
Whoever strapped that bomb
to that poor man...

16:50.454 --> 16:51.787
He must have
been practicing.

16:51.855 --> 16:53.556
Apparently,
it's a remote control rig.

16:54.658 --> 16:56.058
He's telling
the hostage negotiators,

16:56.126 --> 16:58.227
If we don't let him walk out
of there,

16:58.295 --> 17:00.830
If he hasn't delivered the money
to the guy who abducted him

17:00.897 --> 17:02.365
Within the next half hour,

17:02.432 --> 17:04.500
The whole place
is going to blow.

17:04.568 --> 17:05.734
You have to
let him go.

17:05.801 --> 17:07.036
All-all those
people in there.

17:07.104 --> 17:10.006
Actually, he's letting them out.

17:10.073 --> 17:11.641
The hostage negotiator
convinced him that patrick here

17:11.708 --> 17:12.907
Could defuse
that rig he's wearing,

17:12.976 --> 17:15.176
But that we had to get
all the people out first.

17:15.244 --> 17:16.846
Is that true?
can you do that?

17:16.913 --> 17:18.580
Been doing it 15 years.

17:18.648 --> 17:20.016
But the truth is,

17:20.083 --> 17:22.284
I won't know until i get a look
at the thing.

17:22.352 --> 17:23.486
I'm sorry.
i wish...

17:23.553 --> 17:24.954
I wish i could
tell you more.

17:25.021 --> 17:26.188
No, it all helps.

17:26.256 --> 17:27.823
Really.

17:29.326 --> 17:32.528
The, uh, detective here tells me
that you're a wife and a mother.

17:32.596 --> 17:34.063
(sighs)

17:34.131 --> 17:35.698
Do me a favor, then.

17:35.766 --> 17:37.233
Get out of here.

17:37.300 --> 17:40.069
As far as you can,
as fast as you can.

17:41.171 --> 17:43.105
(school bell ringing)

17:43.173 --> 17:45.241
Ariel:
looks like it hurts.

17:45.308 --> 17:47.009
Oh. hey.

17:47.077 --> 17:48.544
Uh, yeah, that seat belt

17:48.612 --> 17:50.813
Really dug into
me yesterday.

17:50.881 --> 17:54.316
Thought this shirt covered
it up more, but...

17:55.185 --> 17:56.752
Um, i'm jamie.

17:56.820 --> 17:58.287
Ariel.

17:58.355 --> 18:00.856
I'm... i'm sorry
about yesterday.

18:00.924 --> 18:02.591
I... it's really
embarrassing

18:02.659 --> 18:03.959
And upsetting

18:04.027 --> 18:05.561
And...
you know,
at this point, it's...

18:05.629 --> 18:07.129
It's just an inconvenience.

18:07.197 --> 18:10.332
Yeah, but, i mean, your
parents were so nice.

18:12.102 --> 18:14.603
Do you  want to, you know,
borrow this?

18:14.671 --> 18:16.205
To cover the, uh...
oh.

18:16.273 --> 18:17.807
Sure. thank you.
yeah.

18:17.874 --> 18:20.109
(chuckles)

18:21.645 --> 18:23.779
Oh, no, no.

18:23.847 --> 18:26.048
What did i
just do?

18:27.084 --> 18:29.085
Jamie, are you
all right?

18:29.152 --> 18:31.220
Yeah. yeah, i'm all right.

18:31.288 --> 18:33.189
I'm a little sore,
but i'm all right.

18:33.256 --> 18:35.458
Listen to me. we've got
to get out of the car

18:35.525 --> 18:37.226
Right now before
anyone gets here.

18:37.294 --> 18:39.628
And when people do get here,
you've got to tell them

18:39.696 --> 18:41.263
That you were driving.
you understand?

18:41.331 --> 18:42.531
What? no. why?

18:42.599 --> 18:44.533
Sweetie, my record's
not perfect.

18:44.601 --> 18:46.836
If the police find out
that i was driving,

18:46.903 --> 18:48.537
They'd... they'll
give me tests.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.008
Oh, i love you, baby.

18:55.412 --> 18:57.747
Um...

18:57.814 --> 19:00.683
Can i ask you a question?

19:00.751 --> 19:02.551
If you were driving
yesterday morning,

19:02.619 --> 19:04.553
Then how come
your seat belt bruises

19:04.621 --> 19:07.156
Are on your right shoulder?

19:07.224 --> 19:10.326
I mean, if you were driving,
they would be on your left.

19:14.765 --> 19:17.500
You weren't driving,
were you?

19:18.935 --> 19:21.737
Look, we already said the
accident was our fault,

19:21.805 --> 19:23.606
So what does it matter
who was driving?

19:23.673 --> 19:25.541
The insurance is
going to pay for it.

19:25.609 --> 19:26.976
(school bell ringing)

19:27.043 --> 19:29.178
I... i guess
we got to go.

19:29.246 --> 19:30.412
(sighs)

19:30.480 --> 19:32.281
Thanks for the scarf.

19:33.350 --> 19:34.784
Yeah.

19:34.851 --> 19:36.652
<i>male newscaster:
once again, we're told
the bomb squad</i>

19:36.720 --> 19:39.321
Is on the scene
at the mariposa national bank.

19:39.389 --> 19:40.956
And that an expert of some kind

19:41.024 --> 19:43.025
Has been in the bank
for ten minutes now,

19:43.093 --> 19:45.261
But beyond that, officials
are being tight-lipped.

19:45.328 --> 19:48.030
We can tell you,
if you're driving in that area,

19:48.098 --> 19:50.332
Traffic is at
a virtual standstill.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.769
In sports, the national
hockey league featured a...

19:53.837 --> 19:56.071
Man (over radio):
oh, god, god, god, god.

19:56.139 --> 19:58.908
Wilkes:
i need you to
stop doing that.

19:58.975 --> 20:00.743
And i need you to
stop shaking.

20:00.811 --> 20:02.978
Okay.
(horn honking)

20:03.046 --> 20:05.281
I think i've got this
wiring system clocked.

20:05.348 --> 20:06.582
Okay.

20:06.650 --> 20:07.950
(beeping)

20:08.018 --> 20:09.885
Wait, what is that?
why is it doing that?

20:09.953 --> 20:12.154
It's just acting up 'cause
i'm monkeying with it.

20:12.222 --> 20:14.023
Doesn't mean it's
going to explode.

20:14.090 --> 20:15.491
How do you know that?

20:15.559 --> 20:17.159
You-you can't
be sure.

20:17.227 --> 20:19.395
Yeah, actually, i can.

20:19.462 --> 20:22.398
I've disarmed systems
a lot more complicated

20:22.465 --> 20:23.866
Than this one.

20:23.934 --> 20:26.101
Timer's still got about
ten minutes left on it.

20:26.169 --> 20:29.004
Trust me-- it's not
even going to be close.

20:30.607 --> 20:32.041
Now, listen.

20:32.108 --> 20:33.742
This wire i'm looking
at right here?
yeah.

20:33.810 --> 20:34.910
The yellow one?
mm-hmm.

20:34.978 --> 20:38.514
I'm going to
cut it now.

20:38.582 --> 20:41.817
Iafter i cut it,
we'll be in the clear.

20:41.885 --> 20:43.285
You ready?

20:43.353 --> 20:45.354
Just do it.

20:45.422 --> 20:48.123
Okay.

20:48.191 --> 20:49.358
Here we go.

20:49.426 --> 20:50.659
(snipping)

20:51.695 --> 20:53.996
Is that it?

20:54.064 --> 20:56.232
Did... did it work?

20:56.299 --> 20:58.400
Can you... can you get
this thing off me now?

20:58.468 --> 21:00.569
Cut these locks off.

21:00.637 --> 21:03.472
(rapid beeping)

21:03.540 --> 21:04.940
Wait a second.

21:05.008 --> 21:06.976
What is that?
is that... wait.

21:07.043 --> 21:09.245
Hey. is it supposed
to be doing that?

21:09.312 --> 21:11.313
(booming)

21:18.316 --> 21:20.084
All right.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.888
Lieutenant wilkes
is going to be okay.

21:23.955 --> 21:25.756
Apparently, there was
some sort of delay

21:25.824 --> 21:27.291
After the bomb
armed itself.

21:27.359 --> 21:29.460
He had a couple of seconds
to run for cover.

21:29.528 --> 21:31.795
The fire department found
him pinned under a desk.

21:31.863 --> 21:33.464
That desk took the brunt
of the explosion.

21:33.532 --> 21:35.132
Headgear and body armor
handled the rest.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.800
What about the bank robber?

21:36.868 --> 21:38.469
The man wearing the vest?

21:38.537 --> 21:39.703
Yeah, not so lucky.

21:39.771 --> 21:42.373
Crime scene boys found
a piece of a jawbone

21:42.440 --> 21:43.974
And the tip of an
index finger.

21:44.042 --> 21:45.309
That's it.

21:45.377 --> 21:46.644
Everything else was
obliterated--

21:46.711 --> 21:48.512
Including all the money
he was trying to steal.

21:48.580 --> 21:49.947
Well, that's the thing.
i don't think he was

21:50.015 --> 21:51.015
Trying to steal any money.

21:51.082 --> 21:52.449
I think he was a victim
in all of this.

21:52.517 --> 21:54.218
I think somebody forced him
to go into that bank.

21:54.286 --> 21:56.220
Lee told me about
the thing you heard

21:56.288 --> 21:58.722
Or overheard in your car?

21:58.790 --> 22:01.058
Well, i can't, uh,

22:01.126 --> 22:03.561
Shed much light on any of that,
but i can tell you this,

22:03.628 --> 22:05.062
The man who tried
to rob that bank?

22:05.130 --> 22:06.463
He's no stranger to robbery

22:06.531 --> 22:09.066
And he's no stranger to banks.

22:09.134 --> 22:10.467
Name's troy sanborn.

22:10.535 --> 22:12.102
Did five years

22:12.170 --> 22:14.138
Back in the late '90s
for walking into a bank

22:14.205 --> 22:17.107
In denver with a hand grenade.

22:17.175 --> 22:18.943
Wait a second.
if it was his bomb,

22:19.010 --> 22:21.645
Why would he let the bomb squad
in to take look at it?

22:21.713 --> 22:23.981
Why would he let anyone
take a look at it?

22:24.049 --> 22:25.649
And why would
he let it go off?

22:25.717 --> 22:27.418
They think he made it up.
the whole story.

22:27.485 --> 22:29.053
They think he strapped
that bomb to himself

22:29.120 --> 22:31.188
So that after he dumped
the cash that he stole,

22:31.256 --> 22:33.490
He could claim he was
the victim all along.

22:33.558 --> 22:35.159
But let's say
you're right.

22:35.226 --> 22:38.329
Let's say there really is a
second man out there somewhere.

22:38.396 --> 22:39.997
The only thing we know about him

22:40.065 --> 22:41.632
Is that he was wearing
a ski mask

22:41.700 --> 22:44.301
When this supposed abduction
took place.

22:44.369 --> 22:47.304
The one person who could tell us
anything more than that--

22:47.372 --> 22:49.306
Troy sanborn-- is dead.

22:49.374 --> 22:52.543
Now, i know the crime
scene unit recovered

22:52.611 --> 22:54.545
Some small pieces
of the bomb's casing.

22:54.613 --> 22:56.347
Maybe, if we're lucky,
that'll lead us somewhere.

22:56.414 --> 22:57.848
But if it doesn't?

22:57.916 --> 22:59.850
If this mastermind

22:59.918 --> 23:02.319
You believe you heard the other
day really does exist?

23:02.387 --> 23:05.322
Well, he's going to be awfully
hard to track down.

23:05.390 --> 23:06.557
<i>no, that's</i>

23:06.625 --> 23:09.059
Very thoughtful of you
to call, mrs. portman.

23:09.127 --> 23:11.061
Uh, but, no, honestly,

23:11.129 --> 23:12.563
Everything has gone
really well

23:12.631 --> 23:14.565
With your insurance
company so far.

23:14.633 --> 23:16.567
And, uh, the truth is,
we still haven't gotten

23:16.635 --> 23:19.637
An estimate back from the,
uh, from the body shop.

23:21.272 --> 23:23.040
Uh-huh.

23:23.108 --> 23:26.043
Oh, that is a very,
very generous offer,

23:26.111 --> 23:27.544
But i'm-i'm sure that we...

23:27.612 --> 23:29.546
We don't need to take you up
on that.

23:29.614 --> 23:31.548
Okay.

23:31.616 --> 23:33.050
Yeah.

23:33.118 --> 23:34.885
You have a nice night, too, now.

23:34.953 --> 23:36.887
Bye-bye.

23:36.955 --> 23:38.722
It's, uh, lauren portman,

23:38.790 --> 23:40.891
The, uh, saint lauren portman.

23:40.959 --> 23:42.393
Um, she sends you her regards.

23:42.460 --> 23:45.462
And she wants to thank you
again for your patience.

23:46.498 --> 23:48.265
Well, if someone had
to hit my car,

23:48.333 --> 23:50.100
I guess i'm glad
she's the one who did it.

23:50.168 --> 23:51.602
I know, we should try
to schedule all

23:51.670 --> 23:53.237
Of our future
wrecks with her.

23:53.304 --> 23:55.305
She even offered to
drive ariel to school.

23:56.341 --> 23:58.275
Who offered to drive
me to school?

23:58.343 --> 23:59.777
Uh, jamie's mom.

23:59.844 --> 24:03.013
She, uh... that was her
on the phone just now.

24:03.081 --> 24:06.050
Yeah, well, i'm not getting
in a car with that woman.

24:06.117 --> 24:07.584
Well, you don't have to.

24:07.652 --> 24:10.087
It's just nice to know that,
you know, we have the option.

24:10.155 --> 24:13.157
Okay, but that's not
an option for me.

24:14.359 --> 24:16.226
(music playing)

24:16.294 --> 24:18.295
(phone ringing)
(man humming along with music)

24:24.536 --> 24:26.470
Man's voice:
leave a message.

24:26.538 --> 24:27.838
Automated voice:
hello.

24:27.906 --> 24:31.108
This is a message
for jesse reeder

24:31.176 --> 24:33.143
Concerning the collection
of an unpaid debt.

24:33.211 --> 24:36.647
If you are not jesse reeder,

24:36.715 --> 24:39.883
Please contact
the ulterion credit agency

24:39.951 --> 24:41.885
And calls to this number
will cease.

24:41.953 --> 24:43.954
Thank you.
(machine beeps)

24:44.956 --> 24:46.957
(man humming)

25:01.840 --> 25:03.607
Jesse reeder.

25:03.675 --> 25:05.676
Jesse reeder.

25:08.012 --> 25:10.314
(school bell ringing)
ashley:
check it out.

25:10.381 --> 25:11.648
My article on the football team

25:11.716 --> 25:13.283
Made the front page
of the school paper.

25:13.351 --> 25:14.618
No way.
way way.

25:14.686 --> 25:15.853
Mr. benevento said

25:15.920 --> 25:17.488
I'm the first junior to do it
in seven years.

25:17.555 --> 25:20.190
In particular
interest to you

25:20.258 --> 25:22.793
Will be the fifth paragraph
in the second column,

25:22.861 --> 25:24.828
Where i write about my good
friend ariel dubois

25:24.896 --> 25:27.030
Totally wanting junior
sensation chad colburn.

25:27.098 --> 25:29.099
Oh.
(laughs)

25:39.277 --> 25:42.346
Uh, you know,
i was just kidding

25:42.413 --> 25:43.747
About that last
part, right?

25:43.815 --> 25:45.215
Huh?

25:45.283 --> 25:47.518
I didn't actually write about
you wanting chad colburn.

26:02.567 --> 26:04.501
Joe:
but why do you care?

26:04.569 --> 26:06.870
What kind of question is that?

26:06.938 --> 26:08.872
Oh, i don't know.
i'm just fascinated.

26:08.940 --> 26:10.707
I mean, after all these years

26:10.775 --> 26:12.876
I'm still trying to figure out
how your mind works.

26:12.944 --> 26:16.380
I mean, this guy, he gets blown
up trying to rob a bank.

26:16.447 --> 26:18.048
The guy who made his
living robbing banks.

26:18.116 --> 26:21.218
The guy who once walked into
a bank full of people
with a hand grenade.

26:21.286 --> 26:22.386
Me?

26:22.453 --> 26:24.388
I-i kinda figure
good riddance.

26:24.455 --> 26:26.390
But you-- you're
all worked up

26:26.457 --> 26:29.193
That maybe somehow this
guy's a victim in all this.

26:29.260 --> 26:32.196
Well, maybe it has
nothing to do with him.

26:32.263 --> 26:35.699
I mean, it's more like...

26:35.767 --> 26:38.702
It's like a thank you note
that you didn't write.

26:38.770 --> 26:40.537
You wake up every morning
and you think,

26:40.605 --> 26:42.539
"oh, gotta that note."

26:42.607 --> 26:43.974
And you never get around to it.

26:44.042 --> 26:45.809
And then one day
you finally do it.

26:45.877 --> 26:47.077
You write it.

26:47.145 --> 26:48.278
And then you feel better.

26:48.346 --> 26:51.281
You feel... in balance.

26:51.349 --> 26:53.784
I just know that this guy

26:53.852 --> 26:56.520
Did not walk into that bank
of his own free will.

26:56.588 --> 26:58.589
And until everybody else
knows it...

27:00.625 --> 27:03.560
And you call that
thing a gift.

27:03.628 --> 27:05.629
(groans)

27:07.932 --> 27:10.367
(sighs)

27:10.435 --> 27:12.436
(phone ringing)

27:14.873 --> 27:16.373
Hello-hello?

27:16.441 --> 27:18.375
Scanlon:
you were right and i was wrong.

27:18.443 --> 27:20.410
You were right
and we were all wrong.

27:20.478 --> 27:22.079
Really? what i was right about?

27:22.146 --> 27:24.081
Well, jesse reeder, for one.

27:24.148 --> 27:26.083
We found him.

27:26.150 --> 27:27.918
We found that trailer
you dreamed about, too.

27:27.986 --> 27:29.386
It's like bombs"r"us in here.

27:29.454 --> 27:33.090
Wires, detonators,
blasting caps, you name it.

27:33.157 --> 27:35.659
Even a mannequin rigged up
with one of his bomb vests.

27:35.727 --> 27:39.329
Which makes me think maybe you
were right about troy sanborn.

27:39.397 --> 27:40.664
Maybe he was a patsy.

27:40.732 --> 27:43.667
Maybe reeder was the one
pulling the strings.

27:43.735 --> 27:45.669
Really? did reeder confess?

27:45.737 --> 27:49.006
No, but then he's not
in much of a position to.

27:49.073 --> 27:51.508
Looks like he was gearing up
to rob another bank,

27:51.576 --> 27:53.844
When something went off
in his face.

27:53.912 --> 27:56.914
Truth is, there's just not
a whole lot left of him.

27:57.982 --> 27:59.249
The way it stands,

27:59.317 --> 28:00.951
Forensics is going to have
to scrape bits and pieces

28:01.019 --> 28:02.352
Off the walls and ceiling

28:02.420 --> 28:05.522
So we can make a dna match
and issue a death certificate.

28:05.590 --> 28:08.191
Well, thanks for that visual.

28:08.259 --> 28:10.027
I'm going to go back
to sleep now.

28:10.094 --> 28:11.528
Well, i'm going to try, anyway.

28:11.596 --> 28:13.597
Nighty-night.

28:14.999 --> 28:16.934
There you go.

28:17.001 --> 28:19.770
All your thank you
notes are done.

28:19.837 --> 28:21.371
You feel better?

28:21.439 --> 28:24.641
I don't know.
ask me in the morning.

28:24.709 --> 28:26.643
(metallic rattling, siren wails)

28:26.711 --> 28:28.712
(helicopter blades whirring)

28:35.119 --> 28:37.654
(distant siren wailing)

28:37.722 --> 28:39.723
(metallic rattling)

28:42.026 --> 28:44.528
I'm going to die.

28:44.595 --> 28:47.597
We're both going to die,
mr. sanborn.

28:49.067 --> 28:51.001
Just not today.

28:51.069 --> 28:53.070
(metallic rattling)

28:55.406 --> 28:58.141
Mind if i ask why you're holding
those keys there?

28:58.209 --> 29:01.311
Um, they open
the safe deposit boxes.

29:01.379 --> 29:04.314
The man who put this vest on me

29:04.382 --> 29:06.483
Told me to get them
from the bank manager.

29:06.551 --> 29:08.151
He was very specific.

29:08.219 --> 29:11.121
What do you say you let me hold
them for a little while?

29:11.189 --> 29:13.156
That rattling's
kind of distracting.

29:13.224 --> 29:15.759
Okay.

29:15.827 --> 29:17.260
There you go.

29:17.328 --> 29:19.329
There you go.

29:21.766 --> 29:23.700
Okay.

29:23.768 --> 29:25.736
We're about ready to get
down to business here.

29:25.803 --> 29:27.504
I'm going to make a quick sweep,

29:27.572 --> 29:29.539
Make sure nobody's here,
and then we'll get started.

29:29.607 --> 29:30.774
Okay?

29:30.842 --> 29:32.776
No, you're leaving me?

29:32.844 --> 29:34.978
Just for a second,
i promise.

29:35.046 --> 29:37.014
Now, you stand here
and try not to move,

29:37.081 --> 29:38.682
And then i'll be right back.

29:38.750 --> 29:40.317
Okay? in a jiffy.

29:40.385 --> 29:41.585
Okay?

29:46.624 --> 29:49.059
Nice and easy, troy.

29:49.127 --> 29:51.128
Stay perfectly still.

30:20.158 --> 30:23.160
(helicopter blades whirring,
siren wailing)

30:46.517 --> 30:50.120
Okay, we're ready
to get started.

30:50.188 --> 30:53.123
Try to stay calm,
mr. sanborn.

30:53.191 --> 30:56.693
I think i've got this wiring
system all figured out.

30:56.761 --> 30:58.895
(gasps)

31:01.794 --> 31:02.794
I'm sorry, allison,
but you're telling me

31:03.097 --> 31:04.364
That you think patrick wilkes,

31:04.431 --> 31:05.965
The man who almost
got himself killed

31:06.033 --> 31:07.967
Trying to defuse that bomb,
is the same man

31:08.035 --> 31:10.003
Who strapped it on
to troy sanborn?

31:10.070 --> 31:11.237
Not only that.
i'm telling you

31:11.305 --> 31:13.773
He managed to steal
a little over $400,000

31:13.841 --> 31:15.675
While he was at it.
that doesn't sense.

31:15.743 --> 31:17.343
The bomb almost
killed wilkes.
no, it didn't.

31:17.411 --> 31:19.345
After he triggered
the detonating device--

31:19.413 --> 31:21.748
And make no mistake, he is
the one who triggered it--

31:22.015 --> 31:24.150
He had a few seconds
to jump behind that desk.

31:24.218 --> 31:26.119
And he knew
he would have those few seconds

31:26.186 --> 31:27.954
'cause he's the one
who rigged that bomb.

31:28.021 --> 31:29.756
I mean, think
about it.

31:29.823 --> 31:31.557
How much sense does it make

31:31.625 --> 31:32.959
To strap a bomb onto somebody

31:33.026 --> 31:35.027
And ask them
to rob a bank for you?

31:35.095 --> 31:37.697
I mean, how can you be sure
that the police aren't going

31:37.765 --> 31:39.365
To follow him back
to where you're hiding?

31:39.433 --> 31:40.633
Wouldn't you be better off

31:40.701 --> 31:42.568
Figuring a way
to get into the bank yourself,

31:42.636 --> 31:45.138
So you could hide the money
where no one would find it?

31:45.205 --> 31:48.174
Patrick wilkes
knew that

31:48.242 --> 31:50.476
He was gonna be called in
to defuse that bomb,

31:50.544 --> 31:52.812
Just like he knew the police
were gonna cut the power

31:52.880 --> 31:55.114
To that bank while they were
negotiating with troy sanborn.

31:55.182 --> 31:56.449
He was counting on it.

31:56.517 --> 31:58.117
With all
of the security cameras down,

31:58.185 --> 31:59.519
He'd have
plenty of time

31:59.586 --> 32:01.320
To-to stash the money
that he'd forced

32:01.388 --> 32:03.289
Sanborn to steal,
and after that,

32:03.357 --> 32:04.991
The bomb took care of the rest.

32:05.058 --> 32:07.760
The one witness that he had
to the crime was dead,

32:07.828 --> 32:09.095
And the money

32:09.163 --> 32:11.197
That he took would be presumed
lost in the explosion.

32:11.265 --> 32:13.332
No one would even bother
trying to look for it.

32:13.400 --> 32:14.500
Allison,

32:14.568 --> 32:17.136
We found a bomb
vest identical

32:17.204 --> 32:19.071
To the one that
killed troy sanborn

32:19.139 --> 32:20.673
In jesse reeder's home.

32:20.741 --> 32:23.342
Jesse reeder's the
guy you told us to
go find, remember?

32:23.410 --> 32:25.711
So, reeder built
and tested a bomb for wilkes.

32:25.779 --> 32:28.347
And wilkes didn't need reeder
anymore. boom.

32:28.415 --> 32:31.484
I bet you wilkes is
counting on the fact

32:31.552 --> 32:33.719
That finding reeder's body
closes the case.

32:35.689 --> 32:37.723
I don't know what to tell you,
allison.

32:37.791 --> 32:40.960
Most people in this city think
that patrick wilkes is a hero.

32:41.028 --> 32:42.528
They're even giving him a medal

32:42.596 --> 32:43.930
This afternoon.

32:43.997 --> 32:45.998
I can prove what wilkes did.

32:47.301 --> 32:49.402
What's this?
serial numbers

32:49.470 --> 32:51.237
On the deposit boxes
that wilkes used.

32:51.305 --> 32:52.472
Open them up.

32:52.539 --> 32:54.807
You'll find the money.

32:54.875 --> 32:57.210
(school bell ringing)

32:57.277 --> 32:59.879
Here's the thing.

32:59.947 --> 33:02.315
You can't get in the car
with your mom again.

33:02.382 --> 33:03.583
Not when she's driving.

33:03.650 --> 33:05.485
Excuse me?

33:05.552 --> 33:07.653
Look, i know
that you love her,

33:07.721 --> 33:10.289
And i know that it's really hard
to wrap your brain around it,

33:10.357 --> 33:13.326
But she's going to get you
killed if you let her,

33:13.393 --> 33:14.894
So you can't let her.

33:17.464 --> 33:19.398
I'm not guessing

33:19.466 --> 33:21.000
About something
that might happen.

33:21.068 --> 33:23.002
I am telling you about something

33:23.070 --> 33:25.137
That is going to happen.

33:26.807 --> 33:29.575
This is the thing
that people talk about

33:29.643 --> 33:31.577
About you and your
mom, isn't it?

33:31.645 --> 33:34.280
Yeah.

33:34.348 --> 33:36.115
Well, you don't know
what you're saying.

33:36.183 --> 33:38.150
I mean, you don't
know my mom.

33:38.218 --> 33:39.752
She's a great mom.

33:39.820 --> 33:42.188
She is a great mom,

33:42.256 --> 33:45.124
But she's got a problem.

33:49.630 --> 33:51.564
So, how do i get to school?

33:51.632 --> 33:54.200
We'll walk.

33:54.268 --> 33:56.802
I'll walk with you.

33:56.870 --> 34:00.473
And after school, you can
practice driving with me

34:00.541 --> 34:03.576
So that we can get you
your license,

34:03.644 --> 34:06.078
So that you can drive,
really drive,

34:06.146 --> 34:09.081
And not just take the blame
when she does.

34:11.118 --> 34:13.052
So call her

34:13.120 --> 34:15.922
And tell her that she doesn't
have to pick you up

34:15.989 --> 34:18.090
Because you're gonna walk home
with a friend.

34:27.234 --> 34:29.335
<i>allison:
what do you mean,
the money wasn't there?</i>

34:29.402 --> 34:31.036
Scanlon:
i mean, we went to the bank,

34:31.103 --> 34:32.772
And we opened up
the safe deposit boxes

34:32.839 --> 34:34.507
You told us about,
and they were empty.

34:34.574 --> 34:35.708
According to the manager,

34:35.775 --> 34:37.208
The woman
who rented them came in

34:37.277 --> 34:39.344
First thing in the morning,
and, uh, cleaned them out.

34:39.413 --> 34:40.612
Woman? what woman?

34:40.681 --> 34:42.447
And how did she get in there?

34:42.516 --> 34:44.550
I thought the bank was closed
for repairs.

34:44.618 --> 34:46.752
It is, except
for the safe deposit boxes.

34:46.820 --> 34:49.121
They're downstairs, and there
wasn't any damage down there.

34:49.188 --> 34:52.525
Now, as for who this woman was,
your guess is as good as mine.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.694
The paperwork she filled out
was signed alma harrison.

34:54.761 --> 34:56.862
Only thing
i can tell you for sure is

34:56.929 --> 34:58.297
That that's not her real name.

34:58.365 --> 34:59.665
What do you mean?

34:59.733 --> 35:01.334
The driver's license,
credit card, social,

35:01.401 --> 35:04.370
Home address she filled out
at the bank-- all that's bogus.

35:04.438 --> 35:06.639
We don't even have
a good picture of her

35:06.707 --> 35:09.308
On the bank security system.

35:09.376 --> 35:11.277
I'm looking at the footage
that was recorded

35:11.345 --> 35:13.112
On the day she rented the boxes,

35:13.180 --> 35:15.615
And all i can tell you is
that she's caucasian,

35:15.682 --> 35:17.450
Approximately five feet,
five inches,

35:17.517 --> 35:18.951
And knows how to duck

35:19.019 --> 35:21.554
Every time she gets close
to one of the cameras.

35:21.622 --> 35:23.956
Well, obviously,
she's wilkes's accomplice.

35:24.024 --> 35:27.226
He-he stashed the money,
and she went in to get it.

35:27.294 --> 35:28.828
You got to bring wilkes in.

35:28.895 --> 35:29.996
Based on what?

35:30.063 --> 35:31.330
None of this proves anything.

35:31.398 --> 35:34.166
A woman with a fake id rented
some boxes at a bank.

35:34.234 --> 35:36.535
Now, would i like
to find her? sure.

35:36.603 --> 35:38.504
Ask her some questions
about patrick wilkes?

35:38.572 --> 35:39.905
Absolutely.

35:39.973 --> 35:42.041
But i don't have a name,
and i don't have an address.

35:42.109 --> 35:44.176
And unless you can tell me
where to locate her, i'm sorry,

35:44.244 --> 35:47.013
But i just can't see us bringing
a case against this guy.

35:47.080 --> 35:48.748
We still friends?

35:48.815 --> 35:50.850
Not so sure about that.

35:56.456 --> 35:57.823
You look happy.

35:57.891 --> 35:59.759
Looks can be deceiving.

35:59.826 --> 36:01.827
I got some good news
and some bad news.

36:01.895 --> 36:02.995
Which do you want?

36:03.063 --> 36:05.064
Give me some good news.

36:05.132 --> 36:07.066
I could use some good news.

36:07.134 --> 36:08.834
The good news is,
the insurance company wants

36:08.902 --> 36:10.636
To write us a check for $2,300.

36:10.704 --> 36:12.405
Well, actually,
that is good news.

36:12.472 --> 36:13.973
So, what's the bad news?

36:14.041 --> 36:16.542
The bad news is,
it's going to cost over $7,000

36:16.610 --> 36:19.712
To repair your car,
which makes no sense.

36:19.780 --> 36:22.248
I think we need to think
about getting a new car.

36:22.315 --> 36:24.483
I don't want to think
about buying a new car.

36:24.551 --> 36:25.918
I have other things
to think about.

36:25.986 --> 36:28.154
You need a car,

36:28.221 --> 36:30.623
And putting $7,000 into one
from the early '90s...

36:30.691 --> 36:31.924
Hey, i heard you.

36:31.992 --> 36:35.094
You know, most people kind of
like getting a new car.

36:35.162 --> 36:37.196
They think it's fun,
they find it exciting.

36:37.264 --> 36:39.098
Well, i'm not like most people.

36:40.133 --> 36:41.934
You know my
dad gave me

36:42.002 --> 36:44.437
That car as a present
for graduating college.

36:44.504 --> 36:45.604
I know.

36:45.672 --> 36:46.772
Well, did i
ever tell you

36:46.840 --> 36:48.507
What i told him when
he gave it to me?

36:48.575 --> 36:50.242
I said i hated it.

36:50.310 --> 36:53.646
I said, "what kind of person
gives a 21-year-old girl

36:53.714 --> 36:55.514
A station wagon?"

36:55.582 --> 36:59.652
And he just looked at me,
and he said, "it's really safe."

37:01.088 --> 37:03.022
And he died four days later.

37:03.090 --> 37:05.024
So, don't push it.

37:05.092 --> 37:06.959
I know what i have to do.

37:07.027 --> 37:08.794
I've known what i had to do

37:08.862 --> 37:11.397
Since i had that dream
of ariel and the girls

37:11.465 --> 37:13.866
And-and that...
that wide road and that truck.

37:13.934 --> 37:15.367
And i will deal with it

37:15.435 --> 37:17.436
When it has to
be dealt with.

37:18.472 --> 37:20.406
<i>woman:
it's done.</i>

37:20.474 --> 37:22.408
Alma harrison is now
the proud renter

37:22.476 --> 37:26.445
Of six large safe deposit boxes
at mariposa national.

37:26.513 --> 37:29.315
Wilkes:
no trouble with the fake id,
the credit card?

37:29.382 --> 37:31.717
None. but do you want
to hear something funny?

37:31.785 --> 37:34.620
You gave alma the same birthday
as the bank manager.

37:34.688 --> 37:36.989
Told him i'd send him a card
that day.

37:37.057 --> 37:38.357
Aren't i an angel?

37:40.393 --> 37:43.129
I'm headed back
to my place now.

37:43.196 --> 37:44.597
Come by after work,

37:44.664 --> 37:47.233
And i will give you the keys
to the boxes.

37:47.300 --> 37:49.235
Female automated voice:
please enter an address.

37:49.302 --> 37:50.402
Wilkes:
what was that?

37:50.470 --> 37:51.871
Uh, it's nothing.

37:51.938 --> 37:54.006
It's the nav system in my car.

37:54.074 --> 37:58.077
I got a little turned around
on my way down from peoria, so

37:58.145 --> 38:01.013
I thought i would try
to find a quicker way back.

38:01.081 --> 38:03.315
(navigation system beeps,
horn honking)

38:04.351 --> 38:06.018
You still there?

38:06.086 --> 38:09.655
Baby, tell me you didn't just
say that you're in your car.

38:09.723 --> 38:12.191
Tell me you took a taxi,
like we planned.

38:12.259 --> 38:14.260
I didn't take a taxi, patrick.

38:14.327 --> 38:17.129
How many times
did we go over this?

38:17.197 --> 38:19.064
The bank has security cameras
outside, too.

38:19.132 --> 38:21.167
If one of them recorded
your license plate...

38:21.234 --> 38:23.402
I didn't come here
in my car, okay?

38:23.470 --> 38:24.904
I'm not an idiot.

38:24.971 --> 38:26.438
I thought i should test run

38:26.506 --> 38:28.607
The id and credit cards
you gave me

38:28.675 --> 38:32.378
Before i used them at the bank,
so i rented a car for myself.

38:32.445 --> 38:35.681
If my license plate
got recorded, who cares?

38:35.749 --> 38:37.116
They'll just trace it back

38:37.184 --> 38:39.385
To the rental office
and alma harrison.

38:39.452 --> 38:41.420
Damn it!

38:41.488 --> 38:43.155
What's wrong?

38:43.223 --> 38:46.425
I dropped my cd between
the seats, and i can't find it.

38:46.493 --> 38:48.260
Screw it.

38:48.328 --> 38:52.164
In a few days, i will be able
to buy all the music i want.

38:52.232 --> 38:55.267
If the guy at the rental office
finds it, he can keep it.

39:11.618 --> 39:13.652
(crickets chirping)

39:34.407 --> 39:36.408
