00:01.814 --> 00:03.649
<i>So tell me how this works.</i>

00:03.683 --> 00:05.717
<i>I'm awake with my wife,</i>
<i>and I close my eyes,</i>

00:05.735 --> 00:08.070
<i>I open them,</i>
<i>I'm awake with my son.</i>

00:08.103 --> 00:10.572
And this has been happening
since the accident?

00:12.775 --> 00:14.726
<i>So you begin</i>
<i>working on one case</i>

00:14.744 --> 00:17.029
<i>here in reality,</i>
<i>and then suddenly</i>

00:17.063 --> 00:19.988
<i>you begin working another case</i>
<i>there in your dream.</i>

00:20.063 --> 00:22.176
<i>It all feels</i>
<i>completely real to me.</i>

00:22.228 --> 00:24.540
<i>You can't tell</i>
<i>whether you're awake or asleep</i>

00:24.604 --> 00:25.637
at this very moment?

00:25.672 --> 00:28.607
<i>Well, I can assure you,</i>
Detective Britten, this is not a dream.

00:28.641 --> 00:31.226
That's exactly
what the other shrink said.

00:39.348 --> 00:41.099
Here's the list of comps
from your neighborhood.

00:41.133 --> 00:42.275
Comps.

00:42.293 --> 00:46.577
Honestly, five years ago, you could've
sold this house and bought an island.

00:46.639 --> 00:49.563
Now it may take a while
just to get back what you owe.

00:49.677 --> 00:53.111
All we have to do
is take care of these repairs.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.464
Here are the contracts.

00:54.530 --> 00:56.481
Just get back to me
with any questions,

00:56.515 --> 00:59.517
and meanwhile, I will start
setting up that open house.

00:59.535 --> 01:01.452
I'll be in touch soon.

01:01.487 --> 01:02.954
Great.
Thank you, Heather.

01:06.492 --> 01:07.709
Hey.

01:07.743 --> 01:10.228
Repaint, huh?

01:10.262 --> 01:13.798
Guess she doesn't know you just
repainted the whole house.

01:13.833 --> 01:15.300
A sink in Rex's bathroom?

01:15.334 --> 01:18.169
I didn't know it was gonna cost
me a sink to move to Portland.

01:18.203 --> 01:22.473
Michael... You know, you don't even
have to deal with any of this.

01:22.508 --> 01:23.892
I can handle it.
Yeah, 'cause you can

01:23.926 --> 01:25.510
do the plumbing, right?
And all the deck repair?

01:25.544 --> 01:29.314
No, I'm gonna hire a heavyset
man with an exposed butt crack.

01:29.348 --> 01:31.983
I'm gonna watch him do it.

01:32.017 --> 01:36.487
You know, we do all these things to the
house, we're not gonna want to move.

01:36.522 --> 01:40.742
You know that... they're gonna
put a "for sale" sign

01:40.776 --> 01:43.494
in the yard, like,
any day, right?

01:43.529 --> 01:47.165
Yeah, I just wouldn't want someone
to drive by who didn't... Today.

01:47.589 --> 01:51.626
Told the captain I needed to
sit down and talk to her today.

01:54.308 --> 01:55.781
Welcome to Ricky's tacos.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.796
How may I help you?

01:56.797 --> 01:59.815
Chicken burrito, no sour cream,
large iced tea, please.

02:03.382 --> 02:04.849
Yeah, that's it.

02:04.884 --> 02:07.518
$6.37. Please pull up.

02:09.253 --> 02:11.456
You can't go to Portland.

02:11.490 --> 02:14.025
You go to Portland,
you'll never know the truth.

02:14.059 --> 02:15.593
What are you talking about?

02:15.628 --> 02:18.213
The Westfield case, Michael.

02:18.247 --> 02:19.647
It all starts with Westfield.

02:27.239 --> 02:28.940
$6.37.

02:28.958 --> 02:32.660
What was that you were saying
about the Westfield case?

02:32.711 --> 02:34.078
Sir?

02:34.112 --> 02:35.947
Just now, on the thing,
you were, you were...

02:35.965 --> 02:37.131
Were you talking
to someone else?

02:37.166 --> 02:38.483
You have your mic open or what?

02:38.517 --> 02:40.585
I didn't say anything, sir.

<i>Detective Britten,</i>
<i>can I ask you</i>

02:54.132 --> 02:55.650
<i>why you're so interested</i>
<i>in this space?</i>

02:55.684 --> 02:59.187
I was investigating a case here
four months ago.

03:01.907 --> 03:04.642
Well, now I'm leasing it for
under a dollar a square foot.

03:04.660 --> 03:06.327
We're practically
giving it away.

03:06.362 --> 03:08.279
Uh-huh.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.649
There was a... a distribution
center here before.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.317
You know what happened to it?

03:13.335 --> 03:14.419
Who knows?

03:14.453 --> 03:16.120
Probably folded
in the recession.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.156
Wherever they went, they didn't
leave anything but the rats.

03:21.493 --> 03:23.011
How long's it been like this?

03:23.045 --> 03:26.047
Oh, I've had this, uh, listing
almost four months.

03:28.350 --> 03:30.685
They didn't leave a forwarding
address, a contact number? No.

03:30.719 --> 03:32.336
No way of getting
in touch with them?

03:32.354 --> 03:33.972
No.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.600
It spoke to you?

03:53.618 --> 03:57.471
This drive-through speaker, -Yeah
...that you order into?

03:57.506 --> 03:58.572
That's interesting.

03:59.958 --> 04:02.430
A dream in which something
that's usually beholden

04:02.431 --> 04:06.050
to your commands,
instead is issuing them.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.759
What do you think that means?

04:07.792 --> 04:08.647
I don't know.

04:08.717 --> 04:13.170
I mean, I like a speaking oracle as much
as the next guy, but... I don't know,

04:13.188 --> 04:15.706
I wish you could count on them
to be more specific.

04:15.741 --> 04:20.261
Dream interpretation relies on accepting
that things which seem random aren't.

04:20.295 --> 04:25.816
Your subconscious is assembling a
particular set of emotions and memories,

04:25.850 --> 04:28.636
and welding them together
to create a narrative.

04:28.670 --> 04:32.373
But I do think that there's one thing
that we can safely take from it.

04:32.407 --> 04:37.878
As your subconscious begins
to make plans for this move,

04:37.913 --> 04:44.535
it's also now trying to stop that move
by drawing your attention to some...

04:44.569 --> 04:46.170
some unfinished business.

04:46.204 --> 04:48.973
Does anything come to mind?

04:49.007 --> 04:52.593
There was a case,
around the time of the accident.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.101
Hey, Bird.

05:00.152 --> 05:01.986
Morning.
Morning.

05:02.020 --> 05:04.739
Hey, remember that, uh, Westfield
Distribution Center thing

05:04.773 --> 05:06.440
we were looking
into a while back?

05:06.491 --> 05:07.525
Vaguely. Why?

05:07.559 --> 05:10.745
Whatever happened with that, after
I was out for the accident?

05:10.779 --> 05:12.062
Well, there was nothing to do.

05:12.080 --> 05:16.283
I mean, you got the employment
records, taxes, payroll.

05:16.334 --> 05:17.785
I mean, everything
came up clean.

05:17.836 --> 05:19.903
Huh. All right.

05:19.921 --> 05:21.422
Whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa...
you just got here.

05:21.456 --> 05:22.590
Where you going?

05:22.624 --> 05:24.408
Records. Just want to
take a peek at the file.

05:24.426 --> 05:25.843
I'll be two minutes.
Really?

05:25.877 --> 05:27.762
Guys, you're up.

05:29.431 --> 05:32.533
Her name is Sabrina Ferris... 17.

05:32.567 --> 05:34.685
Neighbor says she just came
crashing on top of the car.

05:34.719 --> 05:36.220
Apparently, she jumped.

05:38.256 --> 05:39.440
Any other witnesses?

05:39.474 --> 05:42.759
Yeah. Neighbor guy says when he looked
up, he saw a kid standing on the edge.

05:44.262 --> 05:45.613
He saying she was pushed?
No, no.

05:45.647 --> 05:48.699
He said the kid walked
over a few seconds later.

05:52.737 --> 05:55.039
Where is this kid?

05:55.073 --> 05:56.607
We're holding him over there.

05:59.611 --> 06:01.745
<i>We're lab partners.</i>

06:01.779 --> 06:06.150
And, uh, she asked me to
come over to study, and I did.

06:06.184 --> 06:11.789
- And we were, and then she...
- She what?

06:11.823 --> 06:19.430
She... started kissing me and stuff,
and she wanted to... you know...

06:19.698 --> 06:21.632
We had, we had sex.

06:22.667 --> 06:25.667
So she invites
you over... you.

06:26.651 --> 06:31.193
You're studying, then suddenly
she wants to have sex with you.

06:31.503 --> 06:33.104
I know.

06:35.342 --> 06:36.843
I don't know.

06:38.832 --> 06:42.318
As soon as it was over,
she just started crying.

06:43.538 --> 06:46.123
I tried to talk to her,
but she just kept saying

06:46.157 --> 06:48.325
that she was sorry,
and then just ran out.

06:48.905 --> 06:51.898
I went looking for her, and when I
finally found her, she was on the roof,

06:51.944 --> 06:56.959
but she was already on the ledge and j-just...
standing there, just sobbing.

06:57.122 --> 06:59.006
And I tried to stop her,
but she just jumped.

06:59.221 --> 07:00.938
What does that mean,
"I tried to stop her"?

07:00.972 --> 07:03.641
You were talking to her or you actually...
you reached out, you touched her?

07:03.675 --> 07:04.859
No, no.

07:04.893 --> 07:08.846
I just walked toward her,
and... she was already gone.

07:09.575 --> 07:11.160
Why would she jump, Tim?

07:12.226 --> 07:13.824
I don't know.

07:13.882 --> 07:16.517
You son of a bitch, what
did you do to my daughter?!

07:16.543 --> 07:17.727
Daddy!
Hey! Hey.

07:26.772 --> 07:30.447
<i>Did she give him any sign</i>
<i>she might be interested in him?</i>

07:31.259 --> 07:32.330
No.

07:32.385 --> 07:36.772
She was just nice to him because
she feels bad for him, that's all.

07:36.876 --> 07:38.709
Why would she feel bad for him?

07:38.944 --> 07:40.544
He lost his mom.

07:40.562 --> 07:41.712
Never had a dad.

07:41.730 --> 07:44.881
He lives at the foster home
at the church.

07:45.181 --> 07:47.785
Kids make fun of him,
stuff like that.

07:47.904 --> 07:50.668
Uh, why did she agree
to be his lab partner?

07:51.245 --> 07:53.029
I told her that was a mistake.

07:53.212 --> 07:58.483
That she was encouraging him, and...
She just said that I had him all wrong,

07:59.432 --> 08:02.527
he was a good kid, harmless.

08:03.230 --> 08:05.564
I guess, 'cause...

08:06.371 --> 08:09.089
she just sees the good
in people, that's all.

08:09.124 --> 08:10.691
All right.

08:13.308 --> 08:15.075
Oh, my beautiful girl.

08:19.134 --> 08:20.100
Hey.

08:20.135 --> 08:21.552
Guys, just a heads up.

08:21.586 --> 08:23.687
Your pretty girl case
is about to get ugly.

08:23.722 --> 08:25.389
You'll get the full
autopsy report tomorrow,

08:25.423 --> 08:27.358
but we found
your suspect's semen.

08:27.392 --> 08:28.976
Also found vaginal tearing.

08:29.027 --> 08:30.644
Which means that the sex
wasn't consensual.

08:30.695 --> 08:32.229
Yeah.

08:32.263 --> 08:34.815
Now, a rape kit isn't easy to
run on someone that's taken

08:34.866 --> 08:38.986
a ten-story dive, but this
one's pretty definitive.

08:39.037 --> 08:40.537
Thanks.

08:42.724 --> 08:48.278
Look, Tim, sex is
confusing, complicated.

08:48.296 --> 08:51.782
Sometimes we don't even know what's
happening while it's happening.

08:51.816 --> 08:57.221
But the evidence...
shows us that she was injured.

08:57.255 --> 09:00.591
So she must have
wanted to stop.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.127
Now, I know you wouldn't
want to hurt her.

09:05.129 --> 09:06.730
You cared about Sabrina.

09:08.416 --> 09:11.502
So, what happened?

09:13.938 --> 09:16.907
At school,
when it's your birthday,

09:16.941 --> 09:20.844
um, people write their names
on your locker.

09:22.864 --> 09:26.283
Nobody ever did that for me.

09:26.318 --> 09:28.502
And then one year, she did.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.577
Yeah, I know
it didn't mean anything.

09:34.676 --> 09:37.160
I know that she was
just trying to be nice, but...

09:37.178 --> 09:41.248
Everyone loved her
because she was beautiful.

09:42.055 --> 09:46.025
But I loved her because she
treated me like a human being.

09:47.522 --> 09:53.210
- If I thought she was gonna hurt herself, I...
- Tim, you got away from yourself.

09:55.213 --> 09:57.293
It happens.

09:57.369 --> 09:58.706
But here's the thing.

09:58.774 --> 10:03.528
If you're honest about it, people
will take it into account.

10:04.266 --> 10:06.084
So...

10:09.282 --> 10:14.516
Why don't we go through everything,
from the beginning, in your own words.

10:14.908 --> 10:17.049
All right?

10:17.335 --> 10:20.587
D.A. says he'll arraign him on
the rape charge in the morning,

10:20.638 --> 10:22.089
try to work out a plea.

10:22.140 --> 10:23.757
Five hours... got
to be a record.

10:23.808 --> 10:26.810
Yeah, I barely had time
to put it on the board.

10:40.775 --> 10:42.359
Michael.

10:42.393 --> 10:45.228
You wanted to talk?

10:45.246 --> 10:46.580
Yeah.

10:50.618 --> 10:55.205
Westfield Distribution...
records can't find the file.

10:55.239 --> 10:56.874
And what do you need it for?

10:56.908 --> 10:58.742
Well, there were three different
shooters and victims,

10:58.760 --> 11:00.761
all the cases
tied back to the place.

11:00.795 --> 11:02.679
I know.
And you closed them all, right?

11:02.714 --> 11:05.883
Yeah, but I was just beginning
to investigate the warehouse,

11:05.917 --> 11:07.918
the business
before the accident.

11:07.936 --> 11:10.354
You know what, I reassigned it;
It didn't go anywhere.

11:10.388 --> 11:13.757
Well, if we could find the file, I could
take a look, maybe dig something up.

11:13.775 --> 11:15.559
We're up.

11:15.593 --> 11:19.262
All right, let's focus on the
ones that we haven't closed yet.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.447
Okay?

11:20.482 --> 11:21.598
Sure.

11:21.616 --> 11:23.050
Hey, this is one for the books.

11:23.084 --> 11:24.151
You guys ready?

11:24.185 --> 11:25.903
Hotel's going up,
recession shuts it down.

11:25.937 --> 11:27.604
New company comes in,
buys the property,

11:27.622 --> 11:32.726
clears the site, bingo, finds a surprise
in the foundation. Pretty cool, huh?

11:32.761 --> 11:34.778
Oh.
Whoa.

11:34.796 --> 11:36.613
Okay, now, the concrete
keeps out the oxygen,

11:36.631 --> 11:39.282
helps to preserve the body,
but you can't just chip him out,

11:39.300 --> 11:41.969
not if you really want
to avoid destroying him.

11:42.003 --> 11:44.071
So I talked to some paleo
friends, and I've been using

11:44.105 --> 11:48.258
an alternating combination of water
jetting, muriatic acid and calcium baths.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.078
I apply it with a paintbrush and
then slowly remove... Banks.

11:51.112 --> 11:52.479
I'll read it in your book.

11:52.514 --> 11:53.831
Can we skip on?

11:53.865 --> 11:55.599
Oh, I'm sorry,
I just melted a dead body

11:55.633 --> 11:57.768
out of a block of concrete,
which is kind of impossible,

11:57.802 --> 11:59.319
so I thought you might have
five seconds.

11:59.354 --> 12:02.940
You did great. Han Solo didn't look
this good coming out of carbonite.

12:02.974 --> 12:04.074
Why are you showing it to us?

12:04.108 --> 12:05.325
Fractured skull.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.228
Looks like he died from
blunt force trauma to the head,

12:08.263 --> 12:10.448
and then someone tossed him
in this pillar formation.

12:10.509 --> 12:11.459
When was this?

12:11.500 --> 12:13.039
Well, according to
construction reports,

12:13.040 --> 12:14.480
the concrete was poured
three years ago.

12:14.481 --> 12:16.616
Guess you didn't happen
to melt an I.D. out of there.

12:16.659 --> 12:19.182
No, but look at this.

12:19.833 --> 12:24.053
He's got a chipped incisor, and he's
missing the tip of his left forefinger.

12:24.068 --> 12:27.490
So I cross-referenced that information
with missing persons reports

12:27.554 --> 12:29.796
from the time
the concrete went in... bingo.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.534
Pablo Cabrera.

12:31.586 --> 12:34.336
Just use your imagination
where he seems decomposed.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.208
Let me get this straight.

12:36.294 --> 12:38.364
You're handing us a
three-year-old homicide?

12:38.403 --> 12:39.700
Handing you a miracle.

12:39.743 --> 12:40.638
Hello?

12:40.778 --> 12:42.946
I melted him out of concrete!

12:42.981 --> 12:44.781
Anything else?

12:44.816 --> 12:46.984
Ingrates.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.272
You gonna dump it again?

12:53.320 --> 12:55.154
Okay, good, good.

12:55.196 --> 12:56.454
All right.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.532
Jose!

12:59.829 --> 13:01.518
Jose Cabrera?

13:01.581 --> 13:02.882
Can I help you?

13:03.081 --> 13:07.051
I'm Detective Britten, this
is Detective Vega, LAPD.

13:07.084 --> 13:09.135
Um, well, I'm afraid
it's not very good news.

13:09.233 --> 13:11.201
Based on the missing persons
report you filed

13:11.235 --> 13:14.992
three years ago, we believe
we've found your brother's body.

13:21.879 --> 13:23.363
I'm sorry.

13:31.586 --> 13:33.254
Where? What happened to him?

13:33.288 --> 13:36.324
He was over on a three-year-old
construction site, Spring Street.

13:36.358 --> 13:41.045
It was... it was inside
a block of concrete.

13:41.079 --> 13:45.516
That was one of the jobs
he was working.

13:45.567 --> 13:49.670
So obviously the evidence
suggests he was murdered.

13:49.705 --> 13:54.058
We were hoping you might tell us who
would've had a reason to do such a thing.

13:54.092 --> 13:55.642
To kill Pablo?

13:55.661 --> 13:57.144
I can't imagine.

13:57.162 --> 14:02.483
He wasn't in the country but a month,
and then he just disappeared.

14:02.517 --> 14:04.452
He didn't have anything.

14:04.486 --> 14:07.288
He never hurt no one.

14:07.322 --> 14:09.490
Doesn't make any sense.

14:09.508 --> 14:12.243
Well, if you could think of
anybody we could contact,

14:12.277 --> 14:15.279
any place we could go to get
information about his death,

14:15.314 --> 14:16.931
we'd be very grateful.

14:16.965 --> 14:23.170
If you feel up to it, we'd appreciate
you coming to help identify his body.

14:23.188 --> 14:24.505
Sure, of course.

14:44.526 --> 14:45.993
What?

14:46.027 --> 14:47.712
Just thinking.

14:47.746 --> 14:49.530
About what?

14:49.564 --> 14:51.882
Another case.

15:26.825 --> 15:29.610
<i>So Sabrina had a parking pass</i>
<i>in her car</i>

15:29.628 --> 15:33.047
from a college in San Diego,
time-stamped from two days ago.

15:33.082 --> 15:34.448
Okay.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.784
So two days ago, she drives
300 miles, and according to

15:36.802 --> 15:38.753
her father and any of the
friends I managed to contact,

15:38.787 --> 15:40.805
she doesn't mention it
to anyone.

15:40.839 --> 15:43.474
I repeat, okay.

15:43.509 --> 15:47.812
But one of her friends mentioned she has
an ex who is a freshman down there.

15:47.846 --> 15:49.130
Where are you going with this?

15:49.148 --> 15:50.431
Tim practically confessed.

15:50.465 --> 15:52.967
We know she was raped,
we know he had sex with her,

15:52.985 --> 15:54.569
and we know she
flew off the roof.

15:54.603 --> 15:55.636
I mean, the D.A.

15:55.654 --> 15:56.988
actually used the words
"open and shut."

15:57.022 --> 15:59.306
So what does any of this
have to do with San Diego?

15:59.324 --> 16:01.192
Where you going?
Just take the afternoon.

16:01.243 --> 16:02.994
To drive to San Diego?

16:03.028 --> 16:04.195
Yeah.

16:04.246 --> 16:06.447
I'm not going to San Diego.

16:06.481 --> 16:07.832
All right, I'll go myself.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.637
What did you stop
at that place?

16:12.671 --> 16:15.312
Two-for-one Tuesdays.
Here, I got you one.

16:15.457 --> 16:16.952
Hey.

16:17.159 --> 16:19.010
Yeah.

16:19.044 --> 16:20.778
Thanks.

16:22.831 --> 16:24.015
Oh, he's right over there.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.183
Thanks.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.729
Detective Britten, LAPD.

16:38.780 --> 16:41.015
Chris Chapman around?

16:41.033 --> 16:44.318
Uh, I'm Chris.

16:44.352 --> 16:45.686
What's going on?

16:45.704 --> 16:47.505
Can we talk privately?

16:47.539 --> 16:49.490
Uh... yeah.

16:49.524 --> 16:50.625
What's this about?

16:50.659 --> 16:52.243
Sabrina Ferris.

16:54.263 --> 16:57.165
I need to hit the library.

16:57.199 --> 16:59.083
Thank you.

16:59.134 --> 17:00.201
Yeah, yeah.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.019
Come in.

17:02.054 --> 17:04.672
This doesn't feel real.

17:04.705 --> 17:08.893
Yeah, I knew, I knew something was
up with her, but this is crazy.

17:08.926 --> 17:12.046
What does that mean,
you knew something was up?

17:12.064 --> 17:20.671
Two days ago, she shows up, out of the
blue, acting... just acting weird.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.324
Weird, how?

17:23.358 --> 17:31.082
Look, you have to understand, we broke up
because I wanted to start doing it.

17:31.116 --> 17:33.951
And she's, you know,
into the whole abstinence thing,

17:34.002 --> 17:38.756
so... eventually,
you know, it just ended.

17:38.790 --> 17:41.409
How long ago was this?

17:41.443 --> 17:43.044
It was almost a year.

17:43.078 --> 17:46.681
You know, and she pretty much
stopped talking to me after that.

17:46.715 --> 17:50.935
But then, just out of nowhere,
she's at my door,

17:50.969 --> 17:54.922
and she's saying how she made such a
huge mistake, and how she wants...

17:54.940 --> 17:56.307
Now she wants to have sex?

17:56.358 --> 17:58.910
Yeah, she wanted to have sex
with me right then.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.978
And she's kissing me
and she's all over me,

18:01.029 --> 18:04.899
and-and she starts saying stuff about
wanting to have a baby with me

18:04.933 --> 18:06.784
and-and being a family.

18:06.818 --> 18:08.970
So you have sex...
No, no.

18:09.004 --> 18:12.890
I mean, it was so obvious
that she wasn't herself.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.993
She didn't say anything,
give you any kind of hint

18:16.044 --> 18:18.442
of why she might be
behaving in this way?

18:18.544 --> 18:19.646
No.

18:19.984 --> 18:23.255
But... she was religious
about her diaries.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.723
I bet there's something
in her diaries.

18:28.757 --> 18:30.558
That autopsy come back yet?

18:30.592 --> 18:32.626
No. They promised
we'll have it in the morning.

18:32.644 --> 18:33.627
Why?

18:33.645 --> 18:35.963
I don't buy Tim for the rapist.

18:35.981 --> 18:37.898
Well, the grand jury disagreed.

18:37.933 --> 18:40.768
Took them all of five minutes
to get an indictment.

18:40.802 --> 18:43.771
Well, get ahold of the D.A.,
ask her to hold on a beat.

18:43.805 --> 18:45.639
His story is looking
a lot more plausible.

18:45.657 --> 18:46.857
And why's that?

18:46.908 --> 18:48.576
'Cause the kid down here
has the same story.

18:48.610 --> 18:50.644
Sabrina shows up,
tries to force herself on him.

18:50.662 --> 18:52.446
The only difference is
this kid says no.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.648
Well, Banks said Tim raped her.

18:54.666 --> 18:56.650
No, no, no.
Banks says she was raped.

18:56.668 --> 19:01.105
But if it happened before and she had sex
with Tim, signs would still be there.

19:01.139 --> 19:06.160
Okay, so she was raped at some point
in the past, and her response is what,

19:06.178 --> 19:08.462
run around looking for
other people to have sex with?

19:08.496 --> 19:09.663
Why?

19:09.681 --> 19:11.599
That's why we need
the autopsy results.

19:11.633 --> 19:14.335
Maybe the rape left her with
something she wanted to hide.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.370
Like what?

19:16.405 --> 19:18.306
Like a pregnancy.

19:18.340 --> 19:19.340
Ah.

19:19.358 --> 19:20.474
Ah.

19:20.508 --> 19:26.614
Suddenly she's looking for anybody to
be a suitable father in nine months.

19:26.648 --> 19:31.035
The ex says no, so she turns
to sweet, nerdy Tim.

19:31.069 --> 19:33.938
All right, I'll drive back
and see you in the morning.

20:32.047 --> 20:34.048
Would you give me a second?

20:36.685 --> 20:37.968
Yes?

20:38.019 --> 20:39.470
We may have a problem.

20:39.521 --> 20:41.522
He came back again.

20:49.474 --> 20:51.809
You assured us
he was under your control.

20:51.843 --> 20:53.761
The warehouse
is completely clean.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.191
There's nothing
for him to find.

20:55.192 --> 20:56.975
It has been for months.

20:57.032 --> 20:58.276
That's not the point.

20:58.284 --> 21:00.102
The point is he's still looking.

21:00.335 --> 21:02.578
No one is willing to wait
until he walks into a place

21:02.593 --> 21:04.877
where there's something
for him to find.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.057
He's scratching an itch.

21:07.108 --> 21:09.176
There's nowhere for this to go.

21:09.194 --> 21:12.346
Captain, this is
a courtesy call, not a debate.

21:12.380 --> 21:14.181
Plans are already in the works.

21:14.199 --> 21:16.855
You just keep your head down,
let me take care of it.

21:16.904 --> 21:20.023
Carl... Carl, please,
just listen to me...

21:26.011 --> 21:28.462
Yeah, spring street.
I remember that job.

21:28.496 --> 21:30.965
Developer ran out of money,
whole thing got shut down.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.366
I don't recognize him, though.

21:32.384 --> 21:33.384
You sure?

21:33.412 --> 21:35.115
'Cause you barely
looked at the picture.

21:35.393 --> 21:37.074
Illegal?

21:37.272 --> 21:38.893
Uh, we think so.

21:38.934 --> 21:40.030
Of course.

21:40.090 --> 21:44.090
Look, these people... they come and
go during the course of a job.

21:44.122 --> 21:45.122
"These people"?

21:45.164 --> 21:46.548
No offense, officer.

21:46.644 --> 21:47.988
Detective.

21:48.066 --> 21:52.800
Look, I'm not talking about you hardworking
guys who come up the right way.

21:52.839 --> 21:55.846
I'm talking about these guys who
jump over the fence from Mexico.

21:55.877 --> 21:57.928
They get a bunch
of illegal papers,

21:57.947 --> 21:59.814
and they wind up
getting everybody in trouble.

21:59.933 --> 22:01.971
He was from Guatemala.

22:02.135 --> 22:03.443
You know what I mean.

22:03.503 --> 22:04.853
South.

22:05.020 --> 22:09.723
Why don't you, uh, walk around, show the
picture and see what you can pick up.

22:16.165 --> 22:18.684
Partner's a little sensitive.

22:18.718 --> 22:24.718
Yeah, yeah, he's got a bug up his ass
about the whole social injustice thing.

22:24.773 --> 22:26.107
Not me.

22:26.141 --> 22:27.225
Thank God.

22:27.257 --> 22:30.042
Yeah, my whole thing
is code violations.

22:30.428 --> 22:32.363
Guys not wearing hard hats.

22:32.397 --> 22:34.549
Trucks parked on red zones.

22:34.583 --> 22:36.934
Kind of thing makes me
want to call OSHA in here,

22:36.969 --> 22:38.453
go through everything
with a fine-tooth comb.

22:38.487 --> 22:41.622
You know, maybe while they're at it, we
can look at your employment records.

22:41.657 --> 22:43.458
Double-check you're not
looking the other way

22:43.492 --> 22:46.461
on any of those immigration
issues that you're so hot on.

22:47.275 --> 22:49.253
Of course, that could
lead to a total shutdown.

22:49.298 --> 22:51.632
And that'd be... I
don't know, what?

22:51.667 --> 22:53.251
Hundreds of thousands
of dollars a day?

22:53.285 --> 22:55.786
Well, you wouldn't care; You
wouldn't have your job anymore.

22:56.624 --> 23:00.312
Or you could take another
look, and see if you can be

23:00.342 --> 23:02.009
a little bit more helpful.

23:02.060 --> 23:06.931
See if we can't shake something loose
from that big old brain of yours.

23:09.768 --> 23:12.904
Look, I'm sorry.

23:12.938 --> 23:15.806
I really don't
recognize the guy.

23:15.824 --> 23:17.074
All right.

23:17.109 --> 23:19.944
So you remember anything
in particular about the job?

23:19.978 --> 23:22.079
Any workplace accidents?

23:22.114 --> 23:24.248
Fights, problems?

23:24.283 --> 23:27.869
There was a guy...
uh, drunk, violent type.

23:27.920 --> 23:29.820
He got into it a couple times.

23:29.838 --> 23:31.989
I would've fired him,
but he stopped coming back.

23:32.007 --> 23:33.324
All right.
Remember his name?

23:35.010 --> 23:36.260
No.

23:36.295 --> 23:38.796
But, uh, some of the guys
called him El Diablo.

23:40.182 --> 23:42.633
He had some sort of tattoo
of the devil.

23:42.667 --> 23:44.018
You see him since then?

23:44.052 --> 23:45.019
Nope.

23:45.053 --> 23:46.854
You hear anything about him?

23:46.889 --> 23:47.889
No.

23:47.940 --> 23:49.840
Look, he probably went home.

23:49.858 --> 23:52.476
All right, a lot of
these fence jumpers...

23:52.510 --> 23:57.064
Undocumented types... they don't
stick around very long.

23:57.115 --> 24:00.484
Can I go back
to work now, detective?

24:00.519 --> 24:02.236
I'll call you if I need you.

24:04.689 --> 24:07.491
What the hell did you
send me away for?

24:07.525 --> 24:10.127
Don't ever lose your cool when
you're questioning someone.

24:10.162 --> 24:11.712
Make them do that.

24:11.747 --> 24:14.165
Michael, he was being an ass.

24:14.199 --> 24:18.369
Yeah. You threaten to punch someone in
the face, what do they do? They duck.

24:18.387 --> 24:22.373
You threaten to punch him in
the wallet, they always open up.

24:22.391 --> 24:25.042
So what did he say?

24:25.060 --> 24:26.394
He doesn't remember Pablo,

24:26.428 --> 24:28.980
but he does remember this
character called El Diablo.

24:29.014 --> 24:30.031
Troublemaker.

24:30.065 --> 24:33.323
So we hit a bunch of sites, just see if
he made an impression anywhere else.

24:33.345 --> 24:37.282
You have any idea how many
construction sites there are in L.A.?

24:37.614 --> 24:39.782
Look, I've seen cases break
with less than this.

24:40.745 --> 24:43.487
Sometimes all you have
is a faint trail.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.713
<i>You have to follow it</i>

24:45.721 --> 24:47.355
<i>until you find</i>
<i>what you're looking for.</i>

24:47.704 --> 24:50.590
<i>Or it disappears altogether.</i>

24:50.641 --> 24:52.942
The Westfield case, Michael.

24:52.976 --> 24:55.066
<i>It all starts with Westfield.</i>

25:01.268 --> 25:02.435
I have no idea.

25:02.486 --> 25:06.105
A lot of companies tanked when the
economy went into the toilet.

25:06.156 --> 25:07.940
Wherever they went,
they didn't leave anything.

25:07.991 --> 25:09.525
Except the rats, right?

25:09.559 --> 25:11.444
Who told you there were rats?

25:11.495 --> 25:12.445
Is it Jacobs?

25:12.496 --> 25:13.729
All right, listen to me.

25:13.747 --> 25:15.948
He'll say anything to move
a piece of his property.

25:15.999 --> 25:17.333
I keep this place
spick-and-span.

25:17.367 --> 25:18.868
This is crazy.

25:18.902 --> 25:19.902
Oh.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.205
Excuse me.

25:22.239 --> 25:23.206
Yeah?

25:23.240 --> 25:25.191
Autopsy's back.

25:25.225 --> 25:26.876
You were right.

25:26.910 --> 25:29.962
They estimated Sabrina Ferris
was almost four weeks pregnant.

25:30.013 --> 25:33.015
All right, I'll see you
back at the station.

25:35.436 --> 25:36.769
Thanks.

25:36.804 --> 25:39.255
See what you needed to?

25:39.273 --> 25:41.757
Nothing I haven't seen before.

25:57.970 --> 25:59.220
Hi, Ally.

25:59.272 --> 26:02.057
Detectives Britten
and Bird with LAPD.

26:02.108 --> 26:05.277
- Was hoping to have a...
- Hi. Wait in your room.

26:05.311 --> 26:07.779
It's okay.

26:07.813 --> 26:08.964
What's up?

26:08.998 --> 26:12.150
Uh, we were hoping
we could have a quick word.

26:12.184 --> 26:13.685
Sure.
Thanks.

26:15.688 --> 26:17.522
<i>I don't understand.</i>

26:17.540 --> 26:20.425
You guys said Tim did it.

26:20.459 --> 26:22.042
Well, new information
has come to light,

26:22.073 --> 26:25.459
and it makes it look a lot like,
uh, Sabrina may have been

26:25.482 --> 26:29.635
sexually assaulted before
her encounter with Mr. Wax.

26:30.186 --> 26:34.272
What? Mr. Ferris, were you aware
that your daughter was pregnant?

26:35.401 --> 26:37.402
No.

26:38.045 --> 26:39.078
My God.

26:40.479 --> 26:42.401
No... That is impossible.

26:42.463 --> 26:44.684
Sabrina... she was a good girl.

26:44.751 --> 26:46.414
I'm sorry if this is upsetting.

26:46.519 --> 26:48.603
I understand
how difficult it is, but...

26:48.654 --> 26:50.939
We've been told she
kept detailed journals.

26:50.990 --> 26:54.192
Now, if we can get a look at
the last couple of entries,

26:54.226 --> 26:56.611
may help us get
to the bottom of all this.

26:56.662 --> 26:58.896
I don't think
she had anything like that.

26:58.914 --> 27:02.000
Well, it wouldn't be the first time a
teenager kept things from their parents.

27:02.034 --> 27:05.670
Yeah. Uh... sure,
let's take a look.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.470
Mr. Ferris.

27:22.521 --> 27:24.305
Yeah?

27:24.357 --> 27:27.559
Mind if I have a glass of water?
I have a dust allergy.

27:27.593 --> 27:29.194
Uh... yeah, sure.

27:29.228 --> 27:30.278
Thanks.

27:36.952 --> 27:39.988
No journals, no notes.

27:40.039 --> 27:42.574
Either her friends are wrong,
or somebody cleaned up.

27:52.368 --> 27:53.668
What does that look like to you?

27:53.719 --> 27:57.922
Looks like somebody's moving this
dresser in front of that door.

27:57.956 --> 27:59.424
Yeah.

27:59.458 --> 28:03.395
But it's a journal to me.

28:09.185 --> 28:10.468
Here.

28:10.486 --> 28:14.806
Listen, uh...
is this gonna take long?

28:14.824 --> 28:16.725
I want Ally to have
her dinner in peace, you know?

28:16.759 --> 28:23.064
Why don't we continue this conversation
at the station, Mr. Ferris.

28:23.099 --> 28:26.918
You have a suspect in custody,
but instead of prosecuting <i>that</i> case,

28:26.952 --> 28:29.320
you drag a grieving father
down here and insinuate

28:29.338 --> 28:32.290
that he might have
sexually abused his daughter?

28:32.324 --> 28:35.226
To say this is a new low
doesn't do it justice.

28:35.261 --> 28:38.797
She knew who the father was,
I think she was trying to use Tim

28:38.831 --> 28:39.995
to hide that fact.

28:40.052 --> 28:43.724
And when she did what she did, she was
so ashamed, she took her own life.

28:43.806 --> 28:45.978
Your own M.E.
says he raped her.

28:46.029 --> 28:51.033
Her injuries are also consistent with
a prior rape... or pattern of rape.

28:51.677 --> 28:54.813
Pretty soon we're all gonna
know who the father was, so...

28:54.847 --> 28:56.637
you want to tell us now
why your daughter

28:56.638 --> 28:59.188
felt the need to barricade
herself in her room?

28:59.652 --> 29:03.172
Why she dragged her dresser
in front of her door so often

29:03.203 --> 29:05.500
there are gashes in the floor?

29:05.545 --> 29:06.905
This is ridiculous.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.265
What happened to her
journals, Mr. Ferris?

29:09.726 --> 29:11.327
What, they just disappeared?

29:11.384 --> 29:14.920
Gentlemen...
My client isn't saying another word.

29:15.032 --> 29:18.007
If you're gonna charge him, let's
get on with it, but if that's

29:18.037 --> 29:21.701
all you've got, I suggest you open
the door before you see yourselves

29:21.742 --> 29:23.726
facing a civil suit.

29:26.855 --> 29:29.256
Take him to the
watch commander's office.

29:32.434 --> 29:33.935
So...?

29:33.986 --> 29:35.937
Nothing.
He's all lawyered up.

29:37.239 --> 29:39.223
And what about the sister?

29:39.241 --> 29:40.525
Keeping her mouth shut.

29:40.559 --> 29:44.529
Between her lawyer and her father,
she's, uh, pretty terrified.

29:44.563 --> 29:46.581
All right, we'll wait...
I mean, he's not going anywhere.

29:46.615 --> 29:50.785
We'll get him in 12 days when we
have our DNA results from the fetus.

29:50.836 --> 29:54.989
Meantime, what, we send that little girl
home with that scumbag for two weeks?

29:55.024 --> 29:56.624
No. Come on.

30:02.307 --> 30:04.808
How about I give you
an introduction.

30:09.221 --> 30:11.971
Hey.
I brought us some hot chocolates.

30:11.998 --> 30:15.181
If I drink coffee this late,
I will be up all night.

30:15.427 --> 30:17.428
Detective, you
can wait outside.

30:17.446 --> 30:20.264
I'll let you know when
I have further orders.

30:20.469 --> 30:22.303
Yes, ma'am.

30:23.728 --> 30:26.063
Can I just...
Detective.

30:27.665 --> 30:28.864
Yes, ma'am.

30:31.783 --> 30:33.104
You're his boss?

30:33.127 --> 30:33.897
You know what?

30:33.941 --> 30:36.743
I am everybody's
boss around here.

30:36.966 --> 30:38.449
That's cool.

30:38.467 --> 30:42.286
Yeah. Sometimes even I can't
believe how cool it is.

30:42.304 --> 30:46.324
So, what about you, what do you want
to do when you get out of school?

30:46.358 --> 30:48.977
I haven't really
thought about it.

30:49.011 --> 30:50.395
Come on.

30:50.429 --> 30:52.497
You must have,
at least a little bit.

30:53.499 --> 30:55.729
A pediatric oncologist.

30:55.868 --> 30:58.186
Impressive.

30:58.237 --> 31:01.639
Especially for somebody who
hasn't really thought about it.

31:02.400 --> 31:07.916
I'm pretty good at evaluating people,
and I bet that you would pull it off.

31:08.863 --> 31:11.231
But not like this.

31:12.057 --> 31:15.827
You'll never get where
you want to go like this.

31:17.666 --> 31:21.057
All right, you want to know what
usually happens in this room?

31:21.198 --> 31:24.717
A man sits in that chair...
it's almost always a man.

31:26.370 --> 31:29.409
Last month, this guy
threw a chair at me.

31:29.436 --> 31:31.988
See? Three stitches.

31:32.803 --> 31:34.648
But whether it's
the guys in here

31:34.690 --> 31:38.059
or the guys out there, I never
let them see how scared I am.

31:38.110 --> 31:39.677
And, Ally, I do get scared.

31:41.204 --> 31:43.541
But you have to keep going.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.853
You can be any kind
of woman you want.

31:45.894 --> 31:49.180
But if you're gonna be successful,
you have to be brave.

31:50.098 --> 31:53.652
'Cause if you're not, even for one
second, that's when they pounce.

31:54.265 --> 31:56.683
You know what, I'm not just
talking about your enemies,

31:56.742 --> 32:02.352
I'm talking about the people that you're
closest to, the ones you trusted.

32:03.609 --> 32:05.593
Like your father.

32:07.638 --> 32:10.923
I know he was
molesting your sister.

32:11.547 --> 32:15.500
And I think he took
advantage of you, too.

32:15.597 --> 32:19.250
And right now my heart
is breaking for you.

32:19.421 --> 32:24.876
But you need to know...
What your father did was wrong.

32:26.178 --> 32:30.648
And it is completely within
your power to stop it.

32:30.863 --> 32:36.117
All you have to do is be brave... and
I'm looking at you, Ally, and I know,

32:36.168 --> 32:38.920
I know you can do that.

32:40.238 --> 32:45.243
I need you to think
about your sister.

32:47.963 --> 32:51.182
It didn't start
till after our mom died.

32:54.086 --> 32:57.388
He said it was
because he loved us so much.

33:19.411 --> 33:21.379
<i>Don't you find it interesting</i>

33:21.413 --> 33:24.665
<i>that as you try to convince</i>
<i>yourself that you need to stay</i>

33:24.717 --> 33:27.251
to work something out,
some unfinished case,

33:27.285 --> 33:29.420
that your subconscious
changes your dream

33:29.454 --> 33:35.292
from one simple closed case to one you
need to reopen in order to find justice?

33:35.310 --> 33:37.762
Well, maybe I didn't
change the story;

33:37.796 --> 33:41.349
Maybe it just happened
and I had to follow it through.

33:41.400 --> 33:45.136
Are you familiar
with the word "pentimento"?

33:45.154 --> 33:46.604
Pentimento?

33:46.638 --> 33:48.639
Does it go in a sandwich?

33:50.409 --> 33:55.980
It refers to when art historians
inspect a painting...

33:55.998 --> 33:59.000
And discover traces of...

34:00.919 --> 34:02.870
earlier work.

34:02.921 --> 34:08.659
Evidence that the artist changed his
mind in the course of creating it.

34:08.677 --> 34:10.178
Mm?

34:11.213 --> 34:15.666
This is the perfect metaphor
for what your mind has done.

34:15.684 --> 34:18.786
Take your visits
to this warehouse, for example.

34:18.821 --> 34:23.541
It's as if you've drawn over your memory
Of the case...

34:25.610 --> 34:28.913
He had some sort of
tattoo of the devil.

34:30.933 --> 34:32.766
Detective.

34:32.801 --> 34:34.302
Detective?

34:38.090 --> 34:40.241
Jose.

35:05.610 --> 35:07.060
Stop!

35:07.078 --> 35:09.179
Vega, he's running!

35:11.252 --> 35:13.302
He's over the fence!

35:32.971 --> 35:33.854
Get down! Now!

35:35.473 --> 35:37.558
You're not Jose.

35:37.592 --> 35:40.510
- You're Pablo.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

35:40.544 --> 35:41.779
Yeah? So why did you run?

35:41.813 --> 35:45.399
We interviewed men at
construction sites all over town,

35:45.433 --> 35:48.819
and, uh, we couldn't find anyone
who remembered your brother.

35:48.870 --> 35:52.439
But there were quite a few who
remember a guy known as "El Diablo."

35:52.457 --> 35:54.708
Yeah, El Diablo... they
didn't like him much, either.

35:54.742 --> 35:56.126
He wasn't popular.

35:56.161 --> 35:58.829
He was a bad guy... you know,
he was drunk he was mean-tempered,

35:58.880 --> 36:00.297
started a lot of fights.

36:00.331 --> 36:05.219
And when we went back this
morning and showed them your picture,

36:05.253 --> 36:07.554
they all recognized you.

36:07.589 --> 36:09.923
But not as Jose.

36:11.626 --> 36:13.594
As El Diablo.

36:13.628 --> 36:17.431
See, we were betting that that pretty
little tiger tattoo on your shoulder

36:17.465 --> 36:19.566
has a devil underneath.

36:19.601 --> 36:25.022
You came across the border,
killed your own brother,

36:25.073 --> 36:27.024
and took his identity.

36:27.075 --> 36:29.610
We checked into Jose's
employment records.

36:29.644 --> 36:32.913
He last worked as a hotel cook.

36:32.947 --> 36:35.165
He stopped showing up
three years ago.

36:35.200 --> 36:38.585
Luckily, they still had
photo I.D. on file.

36:38.620 --> 36:40.754
Recognize that guy? Hmm?

36:40.788 --> 36:42.789
This guy here?

36:44.125 --> 36:51.265
And this... This is what he looks like...
buried in concrete.

36:51.299 --> 36:52.966
Mira tu hermano.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.269
Look what you did
to your brother.

36:55.303 --> 36:58.605
You really wanted
that green card, huh?

36:58.640 --> 37:01.775
Was killing your own brother
worth that green card?

37:11.819 --> 37:14.304
It was an accident.

37:17.392 --> 37:21.411
As soon as I got here, Jose
was on me about my drinking,

37:21.462 --> 37:23.863
my attitude, everything.

37:24.883 --> 37:27.050
We had a fight,
and he hit his head.

37:27.085 --> 37:31.204
I didn't realize how bad
it was at first, but...

37:32.974 --> 37:37.043
I loved my brother, and I didn't
want to hurt him. I was...

37:37.061 --> 37:39.146
It's tough
to come here with nothing.

37:39.180 --> 37:40.764
Oh, yeah, okay.
Hey!

37:40.815 --> 37:45.936
In Guatemala, people respected me...
here, I was dirt... worse than dirt!

37:47.939 --> 37:51.241
I didn't know how to adjust
the way he had.

37:51.276 --> 37:54.111
Why did you file the missing
persons report on yourself?

37:54.162 --> 37:56.613
I made too much trouble.

37:56.664 --> 38:00.400
One of the bosses
called INS on me.

38:00.418 --> 38:06.540
I figured if I just...
reported Pablo missing, they would stop looking.

38:06.574 --> 38:10.944
I really did become a
better person that day.

38:12.630 --> 38:15.632
I stopped drinking,
I stopped fighting.

38:18.186 --> 38:23.223
I got myself together, started trying
to live the way he wanted me to,

38:23.257 --> 38:24.891
the way he would have.

38:24.925 --> 38:30.447
I took his name, but...
I tried to do the right thing with it.

38:35.153 --> 38:40.907
The thing is...
You try to put it behind you...

38:40.941 --> 38:45.329
Try to tell yourself
it's in the past...

38:45.380 --> 38:53.453
But every day I would wake up and wonder...
Wonder if today is the day...

38:53.471 --> 38:55.889
It came back to me.

38:57.342 --> 39:01.845
You think something like that
would fade after all these years.

39:03.181 --> 39:06.850
But it's the first thing
I thought this morning.

39:09.904 --> 39:17.828
And now... here I am.

39:22.750 --> 39:26.036
<i>Did you find anything when</i>
<i>you visited this warehouse?</i>

39:26.087 --> 39:27.904
No.

39:29.474 --> 39:34.761
Even when you visited the location
in your dreams, still nothing?

39:37.998 --> 39:40.667
What do you think that means?

39:42.804 --> 39:46.005
I don't know.

39:47.525 --> 39:49.175
That I'm still
missing something.

39:51.562 --> 39:53.363
Have you ever considered
the possibility

39:53.398 --> 39:56.149
that maybe there's
just nothing there?

39:56.184 --> 39:59.336
Then why would my subconscious
keep pointing me to it?

39:59.370 --> 40:02.339
Because you need an excuse.

40:02.373 --> 40:04.424
An excuse for what?

40:04.459 --> 40:07.461
<i>To stay right where you are.</i>

40:07.495 --> 40:11.197
<i>To keep everything</i>
<i>just like it is.</i>

40:11.215 --> 40:13.183
<i>You can't admit that</i>

40:13.217 --> 40:15.886
<i>moving represents a threat</i>
<i>to your arrangement,</i>

40:15.920 --> 40:18.221
<i>so you simply create</i>
<i>a distraction,</i>

40:18.256 --> 40:22.676
<i>some unfinished business,</i>
<i>a reason you have to stay put.</i>

40:22.710 --> 40:24.895
<i>But it's a mirage.</i>

40:24.929 --> 40:29.683
<i>You've manufactured a
mystery that does not exist</i>

40:29.717 --> 40:31.685
<i>and can never be solved</i>

40:31.719 --> 40:35.439
so that you never have to face
the thing that you're afraid of,

40:35.490 --> 40:39.159
<i>which is letting yourself</i>
<i>move to Portland.</i>

40:41.562 --> 40:43.947
<i>You're an intelligent man,</i>
<i>detective.</i>

40:43.998 --> 40:45.966
<i>I believe that</i>
<i>if you step back,</i>

40:46.000 --> 40:48.051
<i>you'll begin to see</i>
<i>the situation for what it is...</i>

40:48.086 --> 40:52.189
<i>a frightened mind</i>
<i>grasping at straws.</i>

40:52.223 --> 40:53.740
Welcome to Ricky's tacos.

40:53.758 --> 40:55.058
What can I get you?

41:00.098 --> 41:02.883
Your order, please?

41:05.770 --> 41:08.939
Uh... Large ice tea.

41:08.973 --> 41:10.707
Is that all for you today?

41:10.742 --> 41:12.609
Yeah.

41:24.622 --> 41:26.473
Yes?

41:26.507 --> 41:31.862
<i>I'm not gonna lie,
</i> Michael, I will be...

41:31.896 --> 41:34.247
Incredibly sad to see you go.

41:35.800 --> 41:38.084
But with everything
you've gone through,

41:38.118 --> 41:40.987
I really think it's the best
thing for you and Hannah.

41:42.006 --> 41:44.074
I hope so.

41:45.125 --> 41:46.793
So...

41:49.480 --> 41:52.632
Well, I've just... Given my notice...
I'm not going for a while.

41:52.650 --> 41:54.267
You can save the hug.

41:54.301 --> 41:56.436
Are you gonna...?
All right.

42:04.278 --> 42:09.749
All right, I'm gonna make sure you
land on a good spot up there. Thanks.

42:34.192 --> 42:38.887
<i>Carl,</i> would you
listen to me for one minute?

42:39.067 --> 42:41.035
Call off your dogs.

42:42.310 --> 42:46.396
Our problem just walked out of
my office. He resigned.
