00:02.236 --> 00:03.902
Here you go.

00:03.904 --> 00:05.437
And I hope you enjoyed
dinner and the show.

00:05.439 --> 00:09.608
The show being me pretending
I'm happy as a waitress.

00:09.610 --> 00:10.943
Caroline, where is Max?

00:10.945 --> 00:13.812
And I've already checked
the bowels of hell.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.849
Yeah, I know where I work.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.117
Max is going to be late today

00:18.119 --> 00:19.485
'cause she got stuck
on the subway.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.753
But you said yesterday
she was late

00:20.755 --> 00:22.821
because she was stuck
on the subway.

00:22.823 --> 00:27.459
No, I believe I said yesterday
she got stuck under the subway.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.294
Oleg, a little help.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.529
Oh, Max?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.531
Today she got stuck on a bus.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.834
And you said that the day before
yesterday.

00:35.836 --> 00:38.137
- Earl?
- She got stuck between the moon

00:38.139 --> 00:40.639
and New York City.

00:40.641 --> 00:44.643
I know it's crazy,
but it's true.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.711
Sorry I'm late.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.713
I couldn't find our cat, Nancy.

00:47.715 --> 00:51.517
Also, I was stuck
on the bus or under the subway.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.684
Unless they told you
something different,

00:52.686 --> 00:54.720
then I was doing that.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.322
Oh, come on.
That excuse was less satisfying

00:57.324 --> 01:00.426
than the end of<i> Serial.</i>

01:00.428 --> 01:02.127
Max, really,
what do you take me for?

01:02.129 --> 01:04.496
Well, I know where
I can't take you.

01:04.498 --> 01:08.767
On the big rides
at Disneyland.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.302
Nancy still hasn't come home.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.370
I'm freaking out.

01:11.372 --> 01:12.971
She's the only thing I love.

01:12.973 --> 01:13.972
[gasps]

01:13.974 --> 01:15.841
Whatever.

01:15.843 --> 01:18.310
I had a cat once.
He was cool.

01:18.312 --> 01:22.181
He was black
and very sexually active.

01:22.183 --> 01:26.952
Oh, wait, the cool cat
I'm talking about was me.

01:26.954 --> 01:30.189
Earl, be careful, at your age,
you could die having sex.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.590
I know.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.892
Those ladies don't know
whether I'm coming or going.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.376
I think Nancy might be gone
for good.

01:51.378 --> 01:53.178
I just can't believe
she didn't take me with her.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.780
We had a deal.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.448
Max, she'll come back
to the apartment,

01:56.450 --> 01:58.183
even if she doesn't want to.

01:58.185 --> 02:00.519
I mean, I always do.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.287
I am not surprised
you're not worried.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.455
You never really liked Nancy.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.525
You call her "that cat."

02:06.527 --> 02:10.629
As in, "that cat"
peed on my pillow.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.466
While I was sleeping
on it, Max.

02:14.468 --> 02:18.036
Well, blame me.
I got her drunk.

02:18.038 --> 02:21.940
Hey, everybody!

02:21.942 --> 02:26.845
Look, girls,
I got your pussy in my purse.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.847
Either that's a cat, or
you two got to keep better track

02:28.849 --> 02:32.885
of your belongings.

02:32.887 --> 02:34.686
Yay!

02:34.688 --> 02:38.090
That cat's back.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.525
See, Max?

02:39.527 --> 02:41.927
I am excited.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.296
[baby talk]
Oh, I missed you so much.

02:44.298 --> 02:46.532
Oh, yes, I did.

02:46.534 --> 02:49.401
That's not Nancy.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.936
That is a boy.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.804
Well, Max, sorry I don't check
out a cat's junk

02:52.806 --> 02:54.840
the second it comes through
the door.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.675
Yeah, you only look
at the face.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.912
That's the difference between
you and me.

02:59.914 --> 03:02.948
See, look, the name tag says
"Cinnamon."

03:02.950 --> 03:06.151
No wonder that little girl
kept crying and saying,

03:06.153 --> 03:09.154
"Give me Cinnamon,
Give me Cinnamon."

03:09.156 --> 03:11.924
I looked her right in the eye
and I said,

03:11.926 --> 03:16.161
"I don't carry spices
in my purse."

03:16.163 --> 03:18.330
Max, you are completely
overreacting.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.132
- It's just a--
- Oh! Just a what?

03:20.134 --> 03:22.201
Say it!

03:22.203 --> 03:24.102
- It's just a cat.

03:24.104 --> 03:26.438

Hey, I'm the one who fronted us
that dollar to get her name tag.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.310
Thanks to me, someone's gonna
pick her up,

03:31.312 --> 03:33.545
look at it, and say,
"Oh, you must be lost,

03:33.547 --> 03:35.480

03:35.482 --> 03:37.749
Nancy!
Her name's Nancy!

03:37.751 --> 03:39.084
I know her name!

03:39.086 --> 03:40.886
It got momentarily
pushed out of my head

03:40.888 --> 03:43.789
to make room for those 1,600
cupcake T-shirts

03:43.791 --> 03:45.757
we can't unload or pay for.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.292
You think I don't wake up
screaming

03:47.294 --> 03:50.162
four or five nights a week
about those T-shirts?

03:50.164 --> 03:52.798
But I know our cat's name.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.100
You don't wake up
at night ever.

03:55.102 --> 03:58.570
No, I sleep like a dead baby,
it's my one gift.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.475
Unknown number.
This could be it!

04:03.477 --> 04:08.213

04:08.215 --> 04:09.181
Hello?

04:09.183 --> 04:11.316
- Yes?
- Who is it, Max?

04:11.318 --> 04:13.385
You have her?
Yay!

04:13.387 --> 04:14.286
Oh, sure, great.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.487
- Thank you.
- He has her?

04:15.489 --> 04:16.555
He has Nancy?

04:16.557 --> 04:17.789
Please, too little,
too late.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.698
Max, we're in $10,000 worth
of debt

04:26.700 --> 04:28.467
and you spent money
on new kitty litter?

04:28.469 --> 04:32.404
Relax, I'm going to pee
in it, too.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.206
Well, I guess it beats
that Sprite bottle

04:34.208 --> 04:36.141
you've been using
in your bedroom.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.909
It's just such a long walk
to the bathroom

04:37.911 --> 04:39.311
that every time
I have to go,

04:39.313 --> 04:41.847
it's like
I'm raising money for MS.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.249
Oh, I have good news.

04:44.251 --> 04:48.920
I found your lost bra
in the litter box.

04:48.922 --> 04:49.955
Don't think I'm not still
wearing it.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.390
I mean, why not?

04:51.392 --> 04:54.860
I ate a hot dog that rolled
under a car the other day.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.161
I left a couple
of big clumps in,

04:56.163 --> 04:58.797
just to help you
out a little.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.798
[knock at door]

04:59.800 --> 05:01.300
Oh, okay, that's Nancy.

05:01.302 --> 05:04.703
Here's a chance
for a fresh start for you two.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.039
And don't bring up the bra,
we don't know why she wanted it,

05:07.041 --> 05:09.841
but I'm sure
she had her reasons.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.176
Fine, I'll be
on my best behavior.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.845
But you watch and see
how she treats me.

05:13.847 --> 05:17.649
It's a two-way street.

05:17.651 --> 05:18.984
Hi, I have your cat.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.687
And surprisingly, your doorknob.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.889
Oh, that gum wore out already?

05:23.891 --> 05:26.325

Hi, buddy!

05:26.327 --> 05:28.193
Hi, I'm Caroline.
This is Max.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.795
Thank you so much
for bringing back--

05:29.797 --> 05:31.897
- Nancy!
- I know!

05:31.899 --> 05:34.733
And please note,
she did not even look at me.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.068
Hi. I'm Owen.

05:36.070 --> 05:40.005
Well, we are "Owen" you
a big thank-you.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.707
Kind of low on cash,
how would you feel

05:41.709 --> 05:43.408
about 1,000 cute
cupcake tees?

05:43.410 --> 05:45.310
Yeah, I don't need
1,000 pink T-shirts.

05:45.312 --> 05:49.014
My dad's already mad at me
I don't care about sports.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.749
How do you get
this thing open?

05:50.751 --> 05:52.050
We usually just take Nancy
around

05:52.052 --> 05:54.052
in an old vacuum cleaner bag.

05:54.054 --> 05:57.656
Also doubles as my
"going out" purse.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.891
Pardon me,
may I get past?

05:59.893 --> 06:01.626
Oh, manners.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.961
In our doorway?

06:02.963 --> 06:04.963
I don't know what to do.

06:04.965 --> 06:09.067
What's next, a front stoop with
no discarded heroin needles?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.569
Yeah, I just came up there.

06:10.571 --> 06:13.472
Not today.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.973
Here, let me help.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.775
I mean, I'm the dumb one who
paid $2,000 for a cat carrier.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.211
Hmm.
I miss being that stupid.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.979
You know, my cat
can't get this open either.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.448
It must be the lack of thumbs.

06:23.450 --> 06:26.351
Rich, funny, and in a suit
at 9:00 A.M.?

06:26.353 --> 06:29.054
I really don't know what to do.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.156
You know, my cat, Dickens,
loves your cat.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.725
Oh, Dickens, after the author?

06:33.727 --> 06:36.728
Dickens, after the author,
Max.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.630
Yeah, I know who that is.

06:38.632 --> 06:42.467
The guy who wrote
<i>Muppets Christmas Carol.</i>

06:42.469 --> 06:44.803
There.
I knew I'd get it.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.239
'Cause I have thumbs.

06:47.241 --> 06:49.875
[baby talk]
Oh, there she is.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.176
[cat meows]
- Yes.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.378
So I take it by the cat,
you're single?

06:57.351 --> 06:58.183
Big time.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.886
So, do you and Dickens
live alone?

07:00.888 --> 07:03.121
Oh no, she's trying to flirt.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.623
I travel a lot for work.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.724
I'm a venture capitalist.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.725
So you know how it is.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.793
Oh, I do.
I absolutely do.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.161
- I...
- Here it comes.

07:09.163 --> 07:11.296
- Went to Wharton.
- Boom.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.764
Well, if she gets lost again,
you know where to find her.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.133
She's been hanging around
outside our window

07:15.135 --> 07:16.401
every day for the last couple
of months.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.336
So I let her in.
I hope that's okay.

07:18.338 --> 07:21.273
Is that okay?
It's awesome.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.708
I hope your girlfriend
didn't mind.

07:23.710 --> 07:24.709
We just broke up.

07:24.711 --> 07:25.844
So I'm single.

07:25.846 --> 07:26.945
And I better get going.

07:26.947 --> 07:27.946
I've got a 10:00 meeting.

07:27.948 --> 07:28.947
Max, give the man his case.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.383
He has a 10:00 meeting.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.118
She doesn't want to get out
of cushy this thing.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.553
I totally get it.

07:34.555 --> 07:35.954
I had to be dragged
out of that massage chair

07:35.956 --> 07:38.190
at Brookstone
by mall security.

07:38.192 --> 07:39.958
Well, here's my card,
just give me a call

07:39.960 --> 07:41.359
when you want me
to pick up the case.

07:41.361 --> 07:44.129
You have a card?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.865
A card, a meeting,
a suit, a joke?

07:46.867 --> 07:50.202
Are you the next bachelor?

07:50.204 --> 07:52.237
Well, thank you,
Owen Charles Boyd,

07:52.239 --> 07:54.039
for bringing back
our beloved--

07:54.041 --> 07:55.474
- Her name's Nancy!
- I know her name.

07:55.476 --> 07:58.343
Why do I have to
say it so fast?

07:58.345 --> 08:01.980
She's joking,
she's just not as funny as you.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.482
Well, it was nice to meet you.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.383
Bye, Nancy.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.384
Okay.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.525
Yes, I was flirting.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.227
But I was doing it
for our business.

08:15.229 --> 08:18.330
You should really be doing it
for your business.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.399
'Cause your business
is going out of business.

08:21.401 --> 08:22.400
He has a card.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.870
And it's not
for medical marijuana.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.004
He's a venture capitalist.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.172
That's the kind of fat cat

08:27.174 --> 08:29.074
that can help us get back
on our feet.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.575
Speaking of fat cats,
Nancy's looking like

08:30.577 --> 08:33.879
she might need to give
Jenny a call.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.180
Hey, girls.

08:35.182 --> 08:38.250
Oh, you found Nancy.

08:38.252 --> 08:41.786
I knew she'd come back pregnant.

08:41.788 --> 08:43.522
Wait, Sophie, how can you tell
she's pregnant

08:43.524 --> 08:46.992
and just not fighting the same
battle Jonah Hill is fighting?

08:46.994 --> 08:50.762
Well, her fur is thicker, she's
got a little sparkle in her eye,

08:50.764 --> 08:53.698
and there's a little kitten head
about to pop out of her patoot.

08:58.572 --> 09:01.139
[Nancy meowing]

09:02.009 --> 09:04.676
Come on.
Push, Nancy.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.411
Come on, we all know
what you did.

09:06.413 --> 09:10.315
Now is not the time to be shy.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.017
You do know what you're doing,
right, Sophie?

09:12.019 --> 09:13.385
This isn't like the time
you told us

09:13.387 --> 09:16.922
you could do your own bikini wax
with a candle?

09:16.924 --> 09:20.559
'Cause I still have the
vanilla-scented scars from that.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.127
Don't worry.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.863
In my village,
all the Kuchenskis women

09:24.865 --> 09:26.665
acted as animal midwives.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.301
It was the best way
to meet guys.

09:29.303 --> 09:30.835
Strap in, girls.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.838
[Nancy meowing]
- Ah! She's crowning!

09:33.840 --> 09:35.407
I can't believe it.

09:35.409 --> 09:37.642
I thought Nancy
was smarter than this.

09:37.644 --> 09:39.277
But it turns out she's just like
the rest of the women

09:39.279 --> 09:40.445
in my family.

09:40.447 --> 09:44.716
Screwed by some stranger
she met in the dumpster.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.385
Okay, here we go.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.687
[Nancy meowing]

09:48.689 --> 09:53.458
Oh, there goes my ring.

09:53.460 --> 09:56.061
I--sorry, Nancy.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.662
(Sophie)
Oh, here we go!

09:57.664 --> 10:02.334
Come on, girls, I need some
hot water and fresh towels.

10:02.336 --> 10:04.436
We do, too.
For, like, four years.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.171
Uh...

10:06.173 --> 10:07.572
how about some
of these T-shirts?

10:07.574 --> 10:09.341
Oh, sure why not use those?

10:09.343 --> 10:10.875
They used to be our
bright future.

10:10.877 --> 10:14.813
Now just a ShamWow
for illegitimate cats.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.315
[Nancy meowing]

10:17.317 --> 10:19.250
Oh, my God,
that must be the sound

10:19.252 --> 10:22.721
of a surrendering
cat uterus.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.055
Well, it's the first time
a uterus has surrendered

10:24.057 --> 10:28.460
in that bed in a while.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.495
[kittens meowing]

10:30.497 --> 10:32.263
I don't know why
I'm not throwing up.

10:32.265 --> 10:36.201
Oh, wait.
I'm starting to.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.602
[kittens continue meowing]

10:37.604 --> 10:41.806
Well, I'm off Korean dumplings
for life.

10:41.808 --> 10:44.175
This one--
this one won't come out.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.412
It's like the Queen Latifah
of kittens.

10:50.584 --> 10:55.420
Sophie, I got your text
that you were in bed with Nancy.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.554
Who is this Nancy,

10:56.556 --> 11:00.358
and when did we go back
to doing three-ways?

11:00.360 --> 11:02.661
Nancy's a cat.

11:02.663 --> 11:04.596
Mm, that's a no.

11:04.598 --> 11:07.365
I've got to draw the line
somewhere.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.640
Well, I heard the news.

11:15.642 --> 11:20.178
Looks like you two are
grandmothers before you're 30.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.115
Can't say I'm surprised.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.084
Okay, before you even ask,

11:26.086 --> 11:28.620
I don't pay
for cat maternity leave.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.823
This isn't Google.

11:31.825 --> 11:36.194
This isn't even
Ask Jeeves, Han.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.197
Well, I can help you
get the kittens good homes.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.499
The people in my building
are very nice.

11:41.501 --> 11:45.070
Except if you don't recycle one
bottle of sparkling cider,

11:45.072 --> 11:47.872
then nobody talks to you
in the elevator.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.075
Han, we're not
giving the kittens away.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.943
Nancy landed herself
a rich cat,

11:51.945 --> 11:55.447
we're gonna be living off
a hefty kitty support.

11:55.449 --> 11:57.282
Only you two
would be desperate enough

11:57.284 --> 12:01.186
to try and find a sugar catty.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.021
So has Owen called you
back yet?

12:03.023 --> 12:04.923
Um, we're trading.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.257
"We're trading"?

12:06.259 --> 12:08.126
"We're trading"
is lonely white girl talk

12:08.128 --> 12:10.295
for "he hasn't called me back."

12:10.297 --> 12:12.731
I can't believe this.
He's a deadbeat dad.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.532
Max, he's just busy.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.534
And I think you might
be projecting a little

12:16.536 --> 12:17.702
because of your dad.

12:17.704 --> 12:18.970
Not that I'm a therapist.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.005
I mean,
I can't even afford a couch.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.407
I'm not projecting.

12:22.409 --> 12:26.144
I just know a deadbeat dad
when I don't see one!

12:26.146 --> 12:27.178
Where's his card?

12:27.180 --> 12:28.513
I don't remember where I--

12:28.515 --> 12:31.015
[gasps]
Max, let go! I've got this.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.817
That guy can really help us
with our business.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.686
Please,
let me handle this.

12:34.688 --> 12:35.687
Look, Ryan Gosling.

12:35.689 --> 12:38.123

12:38.125 --> 12:39.257
- I got this.
- I got this.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.592
- I got this.
- I got this.

12:40.594 --> 12:44.896
Keep going, girls,
I'm almost there.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.097
I got this, Max.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.932
And when he comes to get
the cat carrier,

12:47.934 --> 12:48.967
I'll talk to him.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.335
You're way too emotional.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.337
You just went to third base
with my apron.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.078
Sitting on this stoop
is nice.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.946
How come we never
sit out here?

13:01.948 --> 13:03.081
[gunshots ringing]

13:03.083 --> 13:05.583
[woman shrieking]

13:05.585 --> 13:07.552
There it is.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.687
Oh, please,
it's just Rico.

13:12.759 --> 13:16.227
Rico looks good.
I think he got another tattoo.

13:16.229 --> 13:19.130
Look, when Owen gets here,
should we still be alive,

13:19.132 --> 13:20.465
please let me
do the talking.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.168
Kittens aside,
Owen can help us.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.936
A venture capitalist
buys companies

13:24.938 --> 13:26.237
and turns them around.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.573
Yeah, I've seen
<i>Pretty Woman.</i>

13:28.575 --> 13:31.276
That's how I realized
I wasn't charging enough.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.944
Go, Max, here he comes.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.780
All right, but I'll be watching
inside from the window.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.015
It's probably better, because
I don't trust Nancy alone

13:37.017 --> 13:38.316
with those kittens.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.851
She's got some
serious postpartum.

13:39.853 --> 13:41.986
When I left the room,
she was lighting a Menthol 100

13:41.988 --> 13:45.824
with a shaky paw.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.125
Hi.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.327
Crazy we live walking distance
from each other.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.862
We don't.
The Uber driver

13:50.864 --> 13:53.264
wouldn't go past the fire
hydrant on the corner.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.699
The one with the bloody shoe
hanging from it?

13:54.701 --> 13:56.501
That's the one.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.303
[woman screaming]

13:58.305 --> 14:00.471
You know what? I'm just
gonna take the cat carrier.

14:00.473 --> 14:04.275
Before you go...

14:04.277 --> 14:06.211
we have this small cupcake
company

14:06.213 --> 14:07.779
that's just begging
to be an empire,

14:07.781 --> 14:11.049
and I wanted to pick your brain
about some business stuff.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.257
Okay, so your Dickens
got our cat pregnant,

14:19.259 --> 14:21.459
and she just had five kittens.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.494
And at her age, it's a miracle
we didn't have to pay

14:23.496 --> 14:25.096
for in vitro.

14:25.098 --> 14:26.464
How do you know they are
Dickens's?

14:26.466 --> 14:27.932
I'm not saying
that Nancy's easy,

14:27.934 --> 14:29.567
it's just,
I've seen her go in and out

14:29.569 --> 14:32.570
of a lot of windows.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.773
[police sirens blaring
in the distance]

14:35.775 --> 14:37.709
Did he just drop a gun?

14:37.711 --> 14:39.777
It's fine.
He has more.

14:39.779 --> 14:41.412
Okay, call my assistant,
you can pick my brain.

14:41.414 --> 14:45.183
I just don't want it
to be off the sidewalk.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.818
Really, I got to go.
I can't get killed.

14:46.820 --> 14:49.554
I'm wearing new suede loafers.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.156
Uber, an assistant,
and suede loafers?

14:52.158 --> 14:53.424
Are you for real?

14:58.498 --> 14:59.664
I hope I'm not intruding.

14:59.666 --> 15:00.865
No, come in.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.333
I was just brushing
my new loafers.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.702
I bought them as a break-up gift
for myself.

15:04.704 --> 15:08.373
But unlike my ex-girlfriend,
these have a sole.

15:08.375 --> 15:11.209
I didn't wanna mention the cat
situation to your assistant.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.111
Next thing you know,
it's all over the lunch room:

15:13.113 --> 15:16.948
Owen Charles Boyd's cat
is a raw-dogger.

15:16.950 --> 15:19.117
My business partner
stepped on them.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.218
Said it was an accident.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.386
Didn't feel like one.

15:21.388 --> 15:23.288
One shoe yes, but both?

15:23.290 --> 15:25.223
Highly unlikely.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.693
Owen, sometimes in life,
it's not just an innocent cat

15:28.695 --> 15:29.961
that gets screwed.

15:29.963 --> 15:33.097
A girl can get screwed
as well.

15:33.099 --> 15:36.267
Oh, hey, hi.
What's happening?

15:36.269 --> 15:39.737
As in, screwed by one
bad business decision.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.806
My partner, Max, and I
recently invested

15:41.808 --> 15:45.910
all our savings in--
well, here, take a look.

- Oh, my coffee!

15:47.480 --> 15:48.513
- Oh.
- My loafer!

15:48.515 --> 15:51.249
My coffee's on my loafer!

15:51.251 --> 15:53.051
Here, let me.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.385
No, you dab.
You don't wipe suede.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.553
You dab.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.422
Dab.
Dab. I'm sorry.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.456
I used to know that.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.758
That's Rich 101.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.060
Let me just go find some water

16:02.062 --> 16:05.330
and I'll dab, not wipe,
this out.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.898
We're not done yet.
I'm going back in.

16:06.900 --> 16:07.899
It's going really well though.

16:07.901 --> 16:10.234
Where's water?

16:10.236 --> 16:13.137
Do you know how to unsend
an email?

16:13.139 --> 16:15.740
If I did, my rich ex-boyfriend
would've never found out

16:15.742 --> 16:17.308
what I thought
of his lisp

16:17.310 --> 16:20.545
and I'd be living in the
"thouth of Franth" right now.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.747
[elevator bell dings]

16:22.749 --> 16:24.015
Where is he?

16:24.017 --> 16:26.751
He needs to see
these adorable bastards.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.219
Max, how did you find me here?

16:28.221 --> 16:30.388
I told you I was going
on a "think walk."

16:30.390 --> 16:32.290
I followed you.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.858
I never noticed how much
you check yourself out

16:33.860 --> 16:36.794
in store windows.
You have a problem.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.796
Do either of you know a way
to turn the phrase,

16:38.798 --> 16:43.134
"self-absorbed, ridiculous pig"
into a compliment?

16:43.136 --> 16:46.004
If I did, I'd still be
on<i> The Apprentice.</i>

16:46.006 --> 16:47.405
Owen's going to see that email

16:47.407 --> 16:48.740
and I'm going to get fired.

16:48.742 --> 16:52.010
I have to start paying attention
to details.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.644
I'm just gonna go back in.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.813
What?
I don't care.

16:55.815 --> 16:56.914
Not without me you're not.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.249
Max, please, let me handle this.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.550
I'm begging you.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.887
We're getting close, look,
I'm holding his shoe.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.589
If he doesn't step up here,

17:04.591 --> 17:05.957
these kittens
will feel neglected,

17:05.959 --> 17:07.392
and it is only
a matter of time

17:07.394 --> 17:09.360
till they are waitressing
or worse.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.928
Max, you're wrong.

17:10.930 --> 17:13.698
There's nothing worse
than waitressing.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.999
Max, stop!

17:15.001 --> 17:16.200
You'll ruin everything.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.802
I can fix this and us.

17:17.804 --> 17:20.004
We are beyond help.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.706
It's all about these kittens.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.041
- Now move, I got this.
- No, I got this.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.342
- I got this.
- I got this.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.344
- I--
- [gasps]

17:26.346 --> 17:27.812
Oh, my God.

17:27.814 --> 17:28.813
What the hell
is happening?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.548
[kittens meowing]

17:30.550 --> 17:34.786
That's right. I came to your
office with a basket of cats.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.387
Max, I'm so sorry.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.090
Yeah, well, he's the one
who should be sorry.

17:39.092 --> 17:43.828
I want you to look
these kittens in the whiskers

17:43.830 --> 17:46.998
and tell them that Dickens
is not their father.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.666
What makes you think
they're mine. Why?

17:48.668 --> 17:51.235
Because they look
just like Dickens

17:51.237 --> 17:53.938
when he was a tiny
baby kitten.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.240
Oh, and this one's even cuter.

17:56.242 --> 17:57.375
And that one.

17:57.377 --> 17:58.976
I'll take them all.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.244
But not that one.
Seems a little off.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.980
Not quite as alert
as the others.

18:02.982 --> 18:06.184
Oh, she's not good enough
for you?

18:06.186 --> 18:08.086
- Max. Projecting.
- I'm not projecting.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.353
He said
she's not good enough for him.

18:09.355 --> 18:10.721
What?

18:10.723 --> 18:14.092
Just because she was unplanned
and not good at math?

18:14.094 --> 18:16.661

18:16.663 --> 18:17.962
Okay, fine.
I'm projecting.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.197
What is going on?

18:19.199 --> 18:20.531
Caroline, are we gonna hook up
or what?

18:20.533 --> 18:23.267
This is, like the weirdest
foreplay ever.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.903
Hook up? What would make you
think I want to hook up?

18:25.905 --> 18:28.439
Oh, because I
business flirted?

18:28.441 --> 18:29.941
That's Wharton 101.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.776
It was more
than business flirting.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.010
You begged to come to my office,

18:33.012 --> 18:35.480
show up wearing
a see-through shirt.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.614
That was not by choice.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.349
It is cheaply made.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.151
I came here to talk to you
about our business,

18:40.153 --> 18:43.020
and possibly get you to invest
in a small, but spirited--

18:43.022 --> 18:45.857
Invest? This is the financial
capital of the world.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.692
[baby talk]
Yes, it is.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.761
Why would I invest in a
desperate little cupcake shop?

18:50.763 --> 18:54.765
(both)
You!

18:54.767 --> 18:55.967
That's it!

18:55.969 --> 18:57.568
No cats for you.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.803
(Caroline)
You know what?

18:58.805 --> 19:01.239
You are a self-absorbed,
ridiculous pig.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.073
Says you.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.341
And your assistant.

19:03.343 --> 19:06.777
Check your email.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.546
I was able to unsend it.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.681
Yay!

19:10.683 --> 19:15.052
Yeah, might want to re-ignite
that LinkedIn profile.

19:15.054 --> 19:17.088
You're gonna be home a lot more,
you want a cat?

19:17.090 --> 19:18.289

[kittens meowing]

19:23.997 --> 19:25.396
Thanks for taking the kittens,
Han.

19:25.398 --> 19:26.931
I feel like you have
an understanding

19:26.933 --> 19:30.101
of small creatures,
being one yourself.

19:30.103 --> 19:33.070
Have no fear, my building
is loaded with lesbians.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.372
They take home rescue cats

19:34.374 --> 19:37.275
faster than they take home
other lesbians.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.410
Okay, let's discuss my terms.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.978
Unlike all my
non-animal children,

19:40.980 --> 19:43.281
I want to know
they're taken care of.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.050
What part of lesbian
don't you understand?

19:46.052 --> 19:49.320
They'll be swaddled
in a flannel shirt by nightfall.

19:49.322 --> 19:52.290
Okay, now this one,
I call Junkie.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.825
'Cause he's got a serious
Catnip problem.

19:54.827 --> 19:57.361
Oh, so you raised a drug addict
within a week.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.863
Sounds about right.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.831
These two should try
and stay together.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.568
We call them
Game of Thrones One

20:03.570 --> 20:04.969
and Game of Thrones Two.

20:04.971 --> 20:08.239
'Cause they're siblings
and lovers.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.574
This one's the boy.

20:09.576 --> 20:14.245
Watch him and learn
what humping looks like.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.980
This one's pretty bland.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.682
She lays around,
doesn't meow much,

20:17.684 --> 20:20.685
and when she does,
she's kind of phoning it in.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.620
We call her Amy Adams.

20:22.622 --> 20:23.888
Yep.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.290
This last one gets
special attention.

20:26.292 --> 20:28.826
She's the smallest,
but she's got potential.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.329
I mean,
look at those nipples.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.865
And now the nipples
are all I see.

20:34.867 --> 20:35.933
Have a nice life.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.568
I'll find you on Instagram.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.569
Check out Grumpy Cat.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.604
Do what he does.

20:39.606 --> 20:40.905
Well, bye, kitties.

20:40.907 --> 20:44.242
And remember,
stripping isn't dancing.

20:44.244 --> 20:48.446
And now all I can see is them
wearing pasties.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.780
You know what, Max?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.649
We don't need that rich guy
to fix our business.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.517
We can do it ourselves.

20:53.519 --> 20:55.253
Who am I kidding?
Our business is in worse shape

20:55.255 --> 20:58.122
than two retired guys
in a golf cart.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.757
Well, you know
what we'd better fix?

20:59.759 --> 21:01.092
Nancy.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.693
'Cause he was right,
she's a slut.

21:02.695 --> 21:06.998
Someone just found her 69-ing
a tabby in the alley.
