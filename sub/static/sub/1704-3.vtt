PRESIDENT REAGAN: <i>Air and naval
forces of the United States</i>

00:09.221 --> 00:12.057
<i>launched a series of strikes</i>
<i>against terrorist facilities...</i>

00:12.091 --> 00:14.059
REPORTER: <i>Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.</i>

00:14.094 --> 00:15.427
REAGAN: <i>He has sanctioned
acts of terror</i>

00:15.462 --> 00:18.164
<i>in Africa, Europe and</i>
<i>the Middle East.</i>

00:18.198 --> 00:20.867
PRESIDENT GEORGE H.W. BUSH: <i>This will not
stand, this aggression against, uh, Kuwait.</i>

00:20.901 --> 00:22.469
<i>REAGAN: This relentless
pursuit of terror.</i>

00:22.503 --> 00:24.171
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH:
<i>We will make no distinction...</i>

00:24.205 --> 00:25.773
REPORTER:
<i>The USS</i> Cole <i>was attacked</i>

00:25.807 --> 00:26.941
<i>while refueling in</i>
<i>the port of Aden.</i>

00:26.975 --> 00:28.910
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.313
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:31.348 --> 00:33.783
<i>The next samba</i>
<i>we're going to swing for you</i>

00:33.817 --> 00:34.917
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.421
...until something stops him.

00:37.455 --> 00:40.290
CARRIE: <i>I'm just making sure</i>
<i>we don't get hit again.</i>

00:40.325 --> 00:43.962
MAN: <i>That plane crashed</i>
<i>into the World Trade Center.</i>

00:45.264 --> 00:47.466
<i>Thousands of people running.</i>

00:47.501 --> 00:51.238
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:51.272 --> 00:53.374
(speaking Arabic)

00:57.880 --> 01:00.248
SAUL:
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

01:00.282 --> 01:02.250
Fuck!

01:02.285 --> 01:04.251
CARRIE: <i>I missed</i>
<i>something once before.</i>

01:04.287 --> 01:07.089
<i>I won't...</i>
<i>I</i> can't <i>let that happen again.</i>

01:08.325 --> 01:10.426
SAUL:
<i>It was ten years ago.</i>

01:10.460 --> 01:12.194
<i>Everyone missed something</i>
<i>that day.</i>

01:12.229 --> 01:14.197

SAUL: <i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

01:26.179 --> 01:28.380
Fatima, tell me what
you know about Abu Nazir.

01:28.414 --> 01:30.349
He's meeting
my husband tomorrow.

01:30.383 --> 01:32.484
Here in Beirut.

01:32.519 --> 01:33.853
You can kill them both.

01:33.887 --> 01:35.254
SAUL: I didn't want her here
in the first place.

01:35.289 --> 01:36.723
She's not well.

01:36.757 --> 01:38.291
<i>I don't know if</i>
<i>this woman's for real</i>

01:38.325 --> 01:40.327
<i>or if Carrie wants her</i>
<i>to be for real.</i>

01:40.361 --> 01:41.428
The way I am now,
I wouldn't trust me either.

01:41.462 --> 01:43.130
But the Carrie
who recruited her,

01:43.164 --> 01:44.164
that one I believe.

01:48.571 --> 01:52.942
(speaking Arabic)

01:52.976 --> 01:54.076
BRODY:
Hi, Roya.

01:54.111 --> 01:55.311
Congressman Brody.

01:55.345 --> 01:57.780
I'm a friend of Nazir's.

01:57.814 --> 02:00.550
I will not help you in the
killing of innocent civilians.

02:00.585 --> 02:02.219
I met a young man yesterday.

02:02.253 --> 02:03.887
Lost both his arms in Iraq.

02:03.922 --> 02:05.856
They have a
fund-raiser coming up,

02:05.891 --> 02:07.892
and I thought that we
could host it together.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.461
Red Team Two, fire discipline
is two shots each.

02:10.496 --> 02:11.830
Targets are two in robes.

02:11.864 --> 02:13.431
ESTES:
<i>Holy shit, it's him.</i>

02:16.069 --> 02:17.069
Fire.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.207
Somebody warned him.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.575
BRODY:
<i>I'm a congressman.</i>

02:22.609 --> 02:24.744
I cannot be texting
secret messages

02:24.778 --> 02:26.513
while I am surrounded by
the fucking Joint Chiefs.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.048
- Is anyone in the apartment?
- No.

02:28.082 --> 02:29.049
- Give me your keys.
SAUL: - Carrie.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.050
We just missed Abu Nazir.

02:30.084 --> 02:31.485
Get in the car.
Back in the car!

02:31.519 --> 02:32.920
We can't leave here without
getting what's in there.

02:35.991 --> 02:38.326
(gunshot)

02:39.928 --> 02:41.162
Carrie.
(Carrie screams)

02:41.196 --> 02:42.196
I got you.

02:50.272 --> 02:51.773
My name is Nicholas Brody.

02:51.807 --> 02:53.108
By the time you watch this,

02:53.142 --> 02:55.177
you'll have read
a lot of things about me.

03:16.232 --> 03:18.232
(speaking Arabic)

03:24.907 --> 03:27.542
This way. Now.

03:27.576 --> 03:30.044
(speaking Arabic)

03:31.480 --> 03:35.616
That briefcase is clearly
marked as a diplomatic bag.

03:35.651 --> 03:36.751
Do not open it.

03:36.785 --> 03:37.885
Key please.

03:42.291 --> 03:43.625
Saul Berenson.

03:43.659 --> 03:45.527
Jewish, yes?

03:47.596 --> 03:49.064
American.

03:54.204 --> 03:57.139
A Lebanese security official

03:57.173 --> 03:58.941
must know better
than to do that

03:58.975 --> 04:02.411
unless he's actually
working for someone else.

04:02.445 --> 04:04.913
Like, say, Hezbollah.

04:28.270 --> 04:30.004
If you don't put that back

04:30.038 --> 04:31.439
and allow me
to continue to my flight,

04:31.473 --> 04:33.507
you'll be the
cause of a serious

04:33.541 --> 04:35.909
diplomatic incident
with the United States.

04:37.979 --> 04:39.880
So, please, take a moment.

04:39.914 --> 04:41.514
Think carefully.
(locks briefcase)

04:46.554 --> 04:48.888
Never come back to Lebanon.

05:04.940 --> 05:08.109
WOMAN: Sir, I need you
to put the briefcase

05:08.143 --> 05:10.077
in the overhead bin
for takeoff, please.

05:10.112 --> 05:11.712
I'll do it.
Just give me a second.

05:40.976 --> 05:43.245
(crickets chirping)

05:43.279 --> 05:45.280
(jazz music playing)

05:50.352 --> 05:51.819
(snaps fingers)

05:51.854 --> 05:53.922
- Jesus, Dad, what?
- What the hell are you doing?

05:53.956 --> 05:56.725
Do you even know
what time it is?

05:56.759 --> 05:57.726
I'm writing a report.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.160
At 3:20 a.m.?

05:59.195 --> 06:01.029
What? Have you been up
all night doing this?

06:01.063 --> 06:03.432
You need to put this
away, and go to sleep.

06:03.466 --> 06:05.433
I can't. Not yet.
I have to get this done,

06:05.468 --> 06:07.736
- and it has to be done right.
- For crying out loud.

06:07.770 --> 06:10.305
Carrie, you have a disease.

06:10.339 --> 06:12.674
Dad, please, not now.

06:12.709 --> 06:14.943
And in case you've
forgotten what I know,

06:14.978 --> 06:17.112
your doctor has told you
a million times... sleep

06:17.147 --> 06:19.148
is one of the most,
if not the most important...

06:19.182 --> 06:20.315
I know.

06:20.350 --> 06:23.285
I know. I'm nearly finished.
I promise.

06:23.319 --> 06:24.453
How much longer?

06:24.487 --> 06:26.989
(sighs) Two hours, max.

06:27.023 --> 06:28.891
One. One more hour.

06:28.925 --> 06:30.325
- Fine.
- You can't

06:30.360 --> 06:32.027
do this to yourself anymore,
sweetheart.

06:32.062 --> 06:33.462
You just can't.

06:33.496 --> 06:35.531
I'm okay.

06:35.565 --> 06:38.001
In fact, I feel pretty great.

06:38.035 --> 06:40.803
Wired is what you are.

06:40.838 --> 06:43.039
There's a difference.

06:45.376 --> 06:46.809
Point taken.

06:46.844 --> 06:48.044
One more hour.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.681
One more.

07:28.321 --> 07:31.156
Sorry. It was just, it was here
on the table and, uh...

07:31.190 --> 07:33.759
And just jumped out at you?

07:33.793 --> 07:35.261
Well, I know how much

07:35.295 --> 07:36.962
you hate talking
about this stuff in public.

07:36.996 --> 07:38.530
Um, I was just curious

07:38.565 --> 07:40.832
what you were planning
to say tonight.

07:40.867 --> 07:43.335
What do you think?

07:45.972 --> 07:47.939
"By my third year in captivity,

07:47.974 --> 07:50.875
I knew that this was
where I was gonna die,

07:50.909 --> 07:53.812
that I had to accept that,

07:53.846 --> 07:55.747
make peace with it,
so that's what I did.

07:55.781 --> 07:57.482
I prepared to die."

08:03.456 --> 08:05.824
"But I didn't die.

08:05.858 --> 08:08.593
Somehow I got to come home
to a wife and two kids

08:08.628 --> 08:11.363
I'd talked myself into
believing would be just fine,

08:11.397 --> 08:12.831
no, better off,

08:12.866 --> 08:15.300
without me.

08:15.334 --> 08:17.903
I mean how could they
really know me anymore?"

08:27.114 --> 08:29.615
Too much?

08:29.650 --> 08:31.784
Well, it's just...

08:31.819 --> 08:35.154
it's the first time
I've ever heard it.

08:35.188 --> 08:37.590
I, um...

08:37.625 --> 08:40.426
I never knew this is
how you felt.

08:40.461 --> 08:42.028
Yeah.

08:42.062 --> 08:44.363
You're right. I don't
really like talking about it.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.299
- Brody.
- What?

08:46.333 --> 08:47.600
Look...

08:47.635 --> 08:49.635
I didn't mean...

08:49.670 --> 08:50.970
It's okay, Jess.
It's all right.

08:51.004 --> 08:52.705
No, no, no, it's not.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.040
Hey...

08:54.074 --> 08:56.475
I know you're doing
this event for me.

08:56.509 --> 08:58.911
I want you to know
I appreciate it.

09:04.117 --> 09:06.552
Thank you.

09:22.803 --> 09:24.070
Hey, Jess, wait, wait.

09:24.104 --> 09:25.471
Wait.

09:25.506 --> 09:26.739
Seriously?

09:26.774 --> 09:29.843
You want me to stop?

09:34.915 --> 09:36.916
No.

09:44.325 --> 09:46.359
Follow me.

09:46.393 --> 09:48.127
Hey.

09:54.401 --> 09:56.402
Brody...

09:56.437 --> 09:58.537
Slow down, slow down.

10:01.474 --> 10:03.842
Look at me.

10:03.877 --> 10:05.210
Go slow.

10:25.265 --> 10:27.166
Yeah.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.769
Like that.

10:36.776 --> 10:39.244
Yeah.

10:39.278 --> 10:41.279
(door opens)

10:50.556 --> 10:52.857
Hey, aren't you
home early today?

10:54.227 --> 10:55.427
Teacher's conference day.

10:55.462 --> 10:57.997
What's your excuse?

10:58.031 --> 10:59.398
- Hey.
JESSICA: - Xander.

10:59.433 --> 11:00.933
Day off at your school, too?

11:00.968 --> 11:02.901
Coincidence, huh?

11:02.936 --> 11:04.503
Or maybe not.

11:04.537 --> 11:07.172
I already graduated
last year. It's all good.

11:07.206 --> 11:08.740
DANA:
So, uh...

11:08.774 --> 11:10.107
slow day in Congress, Dad?

11:10.142 --> 11:11.942
- Or...
- Don't you have

11:11.977 --> 11:14.278
- homework to do?
- I already did it.

11:14.312 --> 11:16.313
(phone buzzes)

11:20.618 --> 11:22.019
(clears throat)

11:22.053 --> 11:24.421
It's work trying
to get a hold of me.

11:26.224 --> 11:27.457
DANA:
Is that the cup

11:27.492 --> 11:29.292
that Chris made for Dad?

11:29.327 --> 11:31.161
Shit.

11:34.332 --> 11:35.232
I got your text.

11:35.266 --> 11:36.867
We have a problem and no time,

11:36.901 --> 11:38.802
so please just listen.

11:38.836 --> 11:40.904
The CIA are in the middle
of processing intelligence

11:40.938 --> 11:42.572
from their operation in Beirut.

11:42.607 --> 11:43.941
They're very close
to finding out

11:43.975 --> 11:45.609
about our friend in Gettysburg.

11:45.643 --> 11:46.810
The Tailor?

11:46.844 --> 11:48.045
You need to go there now

11:48.079 --> 11:49.446
and move him to a safe house,

11:49.481 --> 11:51.081
60 miles further west.

11:51.115 --> 11:53.116
Well, why don't you just call
him and tell him to move?

11:53.151 --> 11:54.651
Because I might unnerve him
unnecessarily.

11:54.685 --> 11:56.820
He needs to be looked
in the eye and reassured

11:56.855 --> 11:58.255
that he's in safe hands.

11:58.289 --> 11:59.756
Why me? Why not you?

11:59.790 --> 12:01.458
Because he doesn't know me.
He knows you.

12:01.492 --> 12:03.093
You're the only one he knows.

12:03.127 --> 12:04.761
How can you be sure the CIA
hasn't already sent

12:04.796 --> 12:06.630
- somebody out there?
- Because I'm sure.

12:06.664 --> 12:07.931
They found an e-mail
that mentions

12:07.965 --> 12:09.566
a contact in Gettysburg.
They're only just now

12:09.600 --> 12:11.701
putting together a list
of suspects in the area.

12:11.736 --> 12:13.303
Is there a problem, Nicholas?

12:13.337 --> 12:15.272
Yeah, I'd say there's
a fucking problem.

12:20.010 --> 12:23.779
I am giving a speech at a dinner
for wounded veterans tonight,

12:23.814 --> 12:26.983
in D.C. which
the vice president is attending.

12:27.017 --> 12:29.819
If you go there now,
you'll make it back easily.

12:29.854 --> 12:31.355
You move him
as fast as possible.

12:31.389 --> 12:33.023
I don't believe this.

12:33.057 --> 12:34.525
Must I remind you,
he's the one man

12:34.559 --> 12:35.793
who knows the truth about you?

12:35.828 --> 12:37.128
(sighs)

12:37.162 --> 12:39.464
Take the Tailor to 124 Mount
Chapel Road, Somerset.

12:39.498 --> 12:41.500
The key's in the
bird feeder on the tree

12:41.534 --> 12:43.435
to the right of the garage,
around back.

12:43.469 --> 12:45.036
Repeat the address back to me.

12:45.071 --> 12:47.806
124 Mount Chapel Road, Somerset.

12:54.814 --> 12:56.816
(doorbell rings)

12:59.219 --> 13:00.919
Can I help you?

13:00.954 --> 13:02.788
Hello, Mr. Mathison.
Is Carrie here?

13:02.823 --> 13:04.190
CARRIE:
Oh, I got it.

13:04.224 --> 13:05.324
Hey, Danny.

13:05.359 --> 13:07.226
FRANK:
CIA never heard of e-mail?

13:07.260 --> 13:09.061
Uh, you making eggs, Dad?

13:09.096 --> 13:10.229
It's lunchtime.

13:10.264 --> 13:11.831
A sandwich then.

13:11.865 --> 13:13.466
Sure.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.034
CARRIE:
Hey, Danny. Sorry about that.

13:15.068 --> 13:16.402
DANNY:
How you doing, Carrie?

13:16.436 --> 13:17.669
I'm good.

13:17.704 --> 13:18.904
- Is that it?
- Yep.

13:18.938 --> 13:20.673
- All 18 pages.
- I'll get this

13:20.707 --> 13:22.041
to everybody right away.

13:22.075 --> 13:23.209
What time is
the debrief with the group?

13:23.243 --> 13:25.211
- Uh, scheduled for 6:00.
- So late?

13:25.245 --> 13:28.080
Estes is at an emergency
threat level briefing all day.

13:28.114 --> 13:30.216
- What's going on?
- Um, nothing specific.

13:30.250 --> 13:33.019
Yet. But the top brass
huddle every single day now.

13:33.053 --> 13:34.653
Hey, can I say...

13:34.688 --> 13:36.389
what you just did
in the field--

13:36.423 --> 13:38.524
was pretty damn impressive.

13:38.558 --> 13:40.125
Thanks, Danny.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.827
I appreciate that.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.363
- I'll text you later to confirm
the 6:00 p.m. debrief. - Thanks.

13:44.397 --> 13:46.399
I look forward to it.

13:51.605 --> 13:53.573
Pickle on your sandwich?

14:02.214 --> 14:04.215
(birds chirping)

14:33.478 --> 14:35.478
(cash register chatters)

14:45.991 --> 14:47.959
(door bell jingles)

14:50.262 --> 14:52.230
<i>Assalamo Allaikum.</i>

14:54.433 --> 14:56.401
<i>Wa 'alaikum-as-salam.</i>

14:58.104 --> 14:59.638
- You.
- I need you to pack a bag.

14:59.672 --> 15:01.473
- Fast.
- Bag? What for?

15:01.507 --> 15:02.674
The CIA know about you.

15:02.709 --> 15:04.677
I gotta get you out of here.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.280
How do you know this?

15:07.314 --> 15:09.582
- I'll explain in the car. Hurry.
- No, tell me now.

15:09.617 --> 15:13.787
The CIA had an operation
in Beirut to kill Abu Nazir.

15:13.822 --> 15:15.956
He escaped,
but they found intelligence

15:15.991 --> 15:17.958
that may lead to you.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.261
- Where are you taking me?
- To a safe house.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.996
How do you know it's safe?

15:23.031 --> 15:25.299
Hey, all I know is
you're not safe here anymore.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.100
Who sent you?

15:27.135 --> 15:28.435
Look, I'm here to help you.

15:28.470 --> 15:29.803
Get a bag, let's go.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.079
Fuck.

15:39.114 --> 15:40.514
Forget the bag. Go.

15:40.548 --> 15:41.682
Go!

15:46.054 --> 15:48.055
Okay, walk.

15:49.924 --> 15:52.092
Get in the car.

15:52.127 --> 15:54.128
Don't make me say it twice.

16:13.113 --> 16:15.080
(tires screech)

16:28.795 --> 16:31.430
CARRIE: Bob kisses his wife
and children good-bye.

16:31.464 --> 16:34.532
ESL STUDENTS: Bob kisses his
wife and children good-bye.

16:34.566 --> 16:38.102
Uh, Bob drives to work
in a red car.

16:38.136 --> 16:40.537
STUDENTS: Bob drives
to work in a red car.

16:41.573 --> 16:45.376
Are you okay, Miss Carrie?

16:45.410 --> 16:46.777
I'm s...
What, Lulu?

16:46.811 --> 16:47.778
What's wrong?

16:47.812 --> 16:50.214
No text from boyfriend, eh?

16:50.248 --> 16:53.016
(students laugh)

16:53.051 --> 16:55.252
GALVEZ (on phone):
Hi, this is Danny Galvez.

16:55.286 --> 16:56.820
Please leave a message.
(beep)

16:56.855 --> 16:57.821
Danny, it's Carrie.

16:57.856 --> 16:59.323
Uh, it's nearly 5:00,

16:59.357 --> 17:01.725
and I never heard back
about the debrief, so...

17:01.759 --> 17:03.427
I'm heading out now.

17:03.461 --> 17:05.929
Uh... call if
anything's changed.

17:05.963 --> 17:07.931
Thanks.

17:11.234 --> 17:14.604
What happens when we get there?

17:14.637 --> 17:16.772
I drop you off. You wait.

17:16.808 --> 17:17.973
They said that?

17:18.009 --> 17:19.943
I'm guessing.

17:19.977 --> 17:21.144
So you don't know?

17:21.178 --> 17:23.713
It's an educated guess.

17:23.747 --> 17:25.915
I wait for what?

17:25.949 --> 17:29.785
Well, I imagine they want to
get you out of the country

17:29.820 --> 17:31.387
as fast as possible.

17:31.421 --> 17:33.288
You imagine. You guess.

17:33.323 --> 17:35.024
Take a breath.

17:36.159 --> 17:37.760
If it wasn't for me,
you'd probably be

17:37.794 --> 17:40.228
on your way to Guantanamo
by now.

17:40.263 --> 17:42.831
You think if they caught me
that I would talk?

17:42.865 --> 17:45.734
They're not gonna catch you now.

17:46.802 --> 17:48.970
You know what else
they didn't tell me?

17:49.004 --> 17:51.005
Your name.

17:55.946 --> 17:58.281
Suit yourself.

17:58.315 --> 17:59.950
We'll be there
in 30 or 40 minutes,

17:59.984 --> 18:01.918
and you'll be
somebody else's problem.

18:05.956 --> 18:07.924
Bassel.

18:09.961 --> 18:11.561
My name is Bassel.

18:14.432 --> 18:16.433
(wheel rattling,
tires screeching)

18:16.468 --> 18:17.668
(cursing in Arabic)

18:33.251 --> 18:35.420
Fuck.

18:42.128 --> 18:44.129
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

18:46.799 --> 18:47.965
There's no fucking jack.

18:53.772 --> 18:55.773
CYNTHIA:
So once the table staff's done,

18:55.807 --> 18:58.843
we can do a final
light and sound check,

18:58.877 --> 19:01.912
and did you bring Nick's speech,
for the teleprompter team?

19:01.946 --> 19:04.047
Oh, I didn't even
think of that.

19:04.082 --> 19:05.916
Um, he has it with him.

19:05.951 --> 19:07.284
Oh... well, where is he?

19:07.318 --> 19:08.886
Can we send someone to get it?

19:08.920 --> 19:10.053
Yeah, I'll call him.

19:10.087 --> 19:11.421
Uh, he's at his office.

19:11.456 --> 19:12.589
Jessica...

19:12.624 --> 19:14.258
you look so nervous.

19:14.292 --> 19:15.426
Relax.

19:15.460 --> 19:16.427
Listen to me.

19:16.462 --> 19:17.595
You're a beautiful woman,

19:17.629 --> 19:19.430
Nick is so charismatic.

19:19.465 --> 19:22.934
You're a great American story
that's just beginning.

19:27.473 --> 19:28.806
Did you loosen the wheel?

19:28.841 --> 19:29.807
This one won't move.

19:30.876 --> 19:32.510
Here, give me that thing.

19:42.788 --> 19:45.122
(grunts)

19:45.157 --> 19:47.158
All right.

20:11.749 --> 20:13.717
All right.

20:14.986 --> 20:17.154
I need you to get in the car.

20:17.188 --> 20:19.390
Start driving it forward--

20:19.424 --> 20:21.425
real slow, okay?--

20:21.459 --> 20:24.161
until the wood straightens, and
it takes the weight of the car,

20:24.195 --> 20:25.495
like a jack.

20:25.530 --> 20:26.830
Okay?

20:26.864 --> 20:28.865
Go.

20:31.769 --> 20:34.505
It only needs a little gas.

20:34.539 --> 20:37.275
Just ease the car forward.

20:37.309 --> 20:39.277
I'll tell you when to stop.

20:41.179 --> 20:43.180
(engine starting)

20:48.653 --> 20:50.086
All right.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.654
(revs engine)

20:51.689 --> 20:52.755
No! Whoa!

20:52.790 --> 20:54.757
Take it easy!

20:54.791 --> 20:56.792
Easy!

21:02.131 --> 21:03.098
Okay, that's good.

21:09.239 --> 21:11.207
(cell phone rings)

21:14.478 --> 21:15.478
Hey.

21:18.883 --> 21:20.284
JESSICA: Where are you?
I called your office.

21:20.318 --> 21:21.652
They said you never went there.

21:21.686 --> 21:23.320
Right, right.

21:23.355 --> 21:26.323
I, uh... I was on my way
out to the office,

21:26.357 --> 21:28.025
I got a call from
the Whip's office...

21:28.059 --> 21:31.196
(Brody continues indistinctly)

21:37.870 --> 21:39.404
Your district? To do what?

21:39.439 --> 21:42.508
Oh, to, uh, to reassure
some union folk

21:42.542 --> 21:44.910
we haven't forgotten about them.

21:44.944 --> 21:48.180
(continues indistinctly)

21:48.214 --> 21:50.582
Jess, I said I'll be back
on time, and I will.

21:50.616 --> 21:53.085
Okay?

21:53.119 --> 21:55.053
You've got to see
this room, Brody.

21:55.088 --> 21:56.989
It's amazing. They've done
such a beautiful job...

21:57.023 --> 21:58.590
Right. That's great.
I can't wait.

22:01.527 --> 22:03.128
...just get back
to this meeting now.

22:03.162 --> 22:04.462
Oh, I almost forgot.

22:04.496 --> 22:05.797
The teleprompter guy
needs a copy of your speech.

22:05.831 --> 22:07.131
I don't need a teleprompter.

22:07.165 --> 22:08.566
I got it all in my head.

22:08.600 --> 22:11.568
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm sure. I'm sure.

22:11.603 --> 22:12.736
Yeah, I'm sure.

22:12.771 --> 22:14.271
Trust me.

22:14.305 --> 22:16.539
It's not as though I haven't
done anything like this before.

22:16.573 --> 22:18.074
Well, drive safe.

22:18.108 --> 22:21.244
Um, I will see you
in an hour and a half.

22:21.278 --> 22:22.579
Copy that.

22:25.783 --> 22:27.684
I was coming to get that.

22:29.654 --> 22:30.854
To finish changing the wheel.

22:30.888 --> 22:32.189
It's okay, I'll get the wheel.

22:32.223 --> 22:34.224
You get the spare.

22:37.729 --> 22:40.063
(jazz music plays on radio)

22:55.681 --> 22:57.515
- Hi, Lorraine.
- Hello, Carrie. You are early.

22:57.549 --> 22:59.050
We weren't expecting you
until 6:00.

22:59.084 --> 23:00.284
Thank, Carl.

23:00.319 --> 23:01.386
Where's David?

23:01.420 --> 23:03.054
In a meeting.
He'll be back soon.

23:26.812 --> 23:28.779
(sighs)

23:35.153 --> 23:37.155
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

23:48.669 --> 23:52.138
ESTES: ...and Abu Nazir's network,
which indicates that right now,

23:52.172 --> 23:55.141
Iran has mustered all hands
on deck to strike us

23:55.175 --> 23:56.709
on our own....

23:56.743 --> 23:58.511
CARRIE:
I'm sorry.

23:58.545 --> 23:59.645
Am I late?

23:59.680 --> 24:01.147
I was told 6:00 p.m.

24:01.181 --> 24:04.184
Which would, in fact,
mean I'm 15 minutes early.

24:04.218 --> 24:06.353
Carrie, you can't be in here.

24:07.422 --> 24:08.689
What's going on, David?

24:08.723 --> 24:11.626
- You're doing the debrief without me?
- Please.

24:14.763 --> 24:16.965
Always debrief with the person
who was in the field, David.

24:16.999 --> 24:18.299
It's in the goddamn manual.

24:18.334 --> 24:19.634
In this case, because it's you,

24:19.668 --> 24:22.771
I decided to go ahead with the
debrief using just the report.

24:22.806 --> 24:24.840
Because it's me?

24:24.875 --> 24:26.575
Meaning what, exactly?

24:26.610 --> 24:28.077
Meaning the detail
of your report.

24:28.112 --> 24:31.513
As usual, quite frankly,
it's, uh, it's excellent.

24:32.548 --> 24:34.950
What...?

24:34.984 --> 24:36.451
Why didn't anyone call me?

24:36.485 --> 24:38.320
I told Danny
to hold off on that,

24:38.354 --> 24:39.721
because I wanted
to see you anyway.

24:40.757 --> 24:42.558
Here I am.

24:42.592 --> 24:43.892
Privately.

24:43.927 --> 24:47.930
To tell you what an amazing job
you did for us in Beirut.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.932
You mean like a...
a pat on the back?

24:49.966 --> 24:50.933
Thanks to you,

24:50.967 --> 24:52.401
we got this close to Abu Nazir,

24:52.435 --> 24:54.336
and took out two of his top
lieutenants in the process.

24:54.371 --> 24:55.671
He's still out there, David.

24:55.705 --> 24:56.906
We let him get away.

24:56.940 --> 24:58.841
We need to be doing
everything possible...

24:58.876 --> 25:01.744
That's not...
your concern anymore.

25:10.119 --> 25:11.586
Well...

25:11.620 --> 25:13.154
what about all that stuff

25:13.189 --> 25:14.589
I pulled out of
the Beirut apartment?

25:14.623 --> 25:15.890
Can you at least tell me

25:15.925 --> 25:17.392
if there was any actionable
intelligence in that?

25:19.228 --> 25:22.364
Between you and me?

25:22.398 --> 25:24.099
Yes, there was.

25:25.168 --> 25:27.569
That's it?

25:29.605 --> 25:31.773
Carrie, you didn't
come here today

25:31.808 --> 25:33.475
expecting to get
reinstated, right?

25:33.509 --> 25:35.477
What? No.

25:36.646 --> 25:39.014
No, of course not.

25:44.954 --> 25:47.423
- I don't know what to tell you...
- You don't have to say anything, David.

25:47.457 --> 25:48.891
- Come on, let me walk you...
- No, you have work to do.

25:48.925 --> 25:51.594
I'll see myself out.

25:53.297 --> 25:55.298
(elevator bell dings)

26:21.961 --> 26:23.428
No.

26:23.463 --> 26:25.364
You stay in the car,
out of sight.

26:25.398 --> 26:26.498
I need to go to the bathroom.

26:26.533 --> 26:28.167
We're five minutes
from the safe house.

26:28.201 --> 26:30.136
- Put a knot in it.
- I need more tobacco.

26:45.085 --> 26:47.053
(rock music playing)

26:48.488 --> 26:50.789
Hey.

26:50.824 --> 26:52.824
Can I get a, uh,
pack of that tobacco,

26:52.859 --> 26:54.426
some papers,
and the rest on gas, please.

26:59.198 --> 27:01.033
Motherfucker.

27:27.828 --> 27:28.995
Bassel!

27:30.964 --> 27:32.498
Bassel!

27:39.272 --> 27:41.807
What did those assholes
do to you now?

27:41.841 --> 27:44.309
I don't want to talk
about it, Dad.

27:44.343 --> 27:46.945
Not tonight. Please?

27:46.979 --> 27:48.513
Where are you going?

27:48.547 --> 27:50.114
I'll be back for
the rest tomorrow.

27:50.149 --> 27:53.518
Um... I'm going home, Dad.

27:53.552 --> 27:55.553
All I know is

27:55.588 --> 27:57.722
I need to figure out what to do
with the rest of my life now,

27:57.756 --> 27:59.557
and I can't do that here
with you all

27:59.592 --> 28:01.459
just hovering over me.

28:01.493 --> 28:04.862
A good night's sleep
is what you need.

28:04.896 --> 28:06.964
In my own bed.

28:12.337 --> 28:14.271
Bassel!

28:15.840 --> 28:17.641
There's nothing to be afraid of.

28:25.884 --> 28:28.552
(rustling)

28:33.759 --> 28:34.893
Come on, buddy,

28:34.927 --> 28:37.562
there's nothing to be afraid of.
Come out.

28:44.070 --> 28:45.704
Bassel?

28:48.842 --> 28:50.643
(phone ringing)

28:53.113 --> 28:58.318
(grunts) Ah! God! God!

28:58.352 --> 29:00.353
(ringing continues)

29:03.691 --> 29:05.658
(ringing continues)

29:13.933 --> 29:15.501
(Bassel groans)

29:15.535 --> 29:16.735
What are you doing?!

29:16.769 --> 29:18.603
I'm trying to fucking help you!

29:18.637 --> 29:20.572
(Bassel groaning)

29:29.682 --> 29:31.283
Shit!

29:33.386 --> 29:36.155
(Brody grunts)

29:36.189 --> 29:38.491

Bassel groans)

(Brody grunts)

30:07.987 --> 30:10.155

30:13.626 --> 30:16.428
All right, got to stop
the bleeding.

30:16.462 --> 30:17.596
You got a handkerchief?

30:17.631 --> 30:19.999
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

30:20.033 --> 30:21.066
You got a handkerchief?

30:25.572 --> 30:27.072
Hold it there.
Hold on.

30:27.107 --> 30:29.141
All right, all right.

30:30.777 --> 30:32.978
Please...

30:33.012 --> 30:35.180
take me to hospital.

30:35.214 --> 30:37.182
No, I take you to the hospital,

30:37.216 --> 30:40.052
I might as well
just hand you over to the CIA.

30:40.086 --> 30:41.554
I don't want to die.

30:41.588 --> 30:42.821
You're not gonna die,

30:42.856 --> 30:46.859
so kill that thought
right fucking now!

30:54.669 --> 30:58.204
I have a family...

30:58.239 --> 30:59.505
Syria.

31:01.475 --> 31:04.878
Wife... daughter.

31:09.216 --> 31:11.451
That's good.
That's good, that's good.

31:11.485 --> 31:13.619
Keep thinking
about your daughter.

31:16.223 --> 31:18.357
She'll give you
the strength you need.

31:22.029 --> 31:24.130
Please... hospital.

31:25.699 --> 31:28.500
(grunts) I'm taking
you to a safe house,

31:28.535 --> 31:30.235
and we're gonna call
for help from there.

31:30.270 --> 31:32.437
(panting)

31:32.472 --> 31:36.475
You can leave me
outside the hospital.

31:36.509 --> 31:40.178
I won't say anything to anyone.

31:40.212 --> 31:43.982
No. You know
I can't do that.

31:44.016 --> 31:45.985

31:46.019 --> 31:48.854

32:02.637 --> 32:04.272
Hey, Jess.

32:04.306 --> 32:05.573
Where are you?

32:05.607 --> 32:06.975
I've been trying to call you.
You're late.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.010
JESSICA: The vice president
is due to arrive any second now.

32:09.045 --> 32:11.179
(panting):
I had a flat, Jess.

32:11.213 --> 32:12.480
A flat?!

32:12.515 --> 32:13.348
Where?

32:13.382 --> 32:15.183
Middle of nowhere.

32:15.218 --> 32:17.285
I don't know, miles
from anywhere. I don't know.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.787
What?!
(Bassel groans)

32:18.821 --> 32:20.288
Christ, Brody!

32:20.323 --> 32:21.523
Hey, and guess what?

32:21.557 --> 32:23.191
There's no jack in the car.

32:23.225 --> 32:25.326
Well, did you call a tow truck?

32:25.361 --> 32:26.828
Yeah, I called a tow truck.

32:26.862 --> 32:28.530
Where'd you tell 'em to go
if you don't know where you are?

32:28.564 --> 32:31.232
What?

32:31.267 --> 32:33.234
Oh, I'm near... I'm
near, uh, Culpepper.

32:33.269 --> 32:34.502
Route 29.

32:34.537 --> 32:35.903
That's miles away.

32:35.938 --> 32:37.872
You're never gonna
make it back in time.

32:37.907 --> 32:39.574
What about your speech?

32:41.010 --> 32:43.144
(inhales sharply) I don't know.

32:43.178 --> 32:44.812
This isn't happening.

32:44.847 --> 32:46.146
It can't be.

32:46.181 --> 32:47.381
BASSEL (weakly):
Help...

32:47.415 --> 32:48.849

32:48.883 --> 32:50.217

33:00.928 --> 33:02.562

Brody, are you there?

33:24.254 --> 33:27.222
You know, I-I think I
should try the tow truck again.

33:27.257 --> 33:29.057
You promised you would be here.

Hello.

41:27.623 --> 41:31.360
Um, my name is Jessica Brody.

41:31.394 --> 41:34.830
My husband, Nick Brody,
who, most of you know,

41:34.864 --> 41:39.269
was rescued and returned to us
after eight years

41:39.303 --> 41:41.371
as a prisoner of the terrorists,

41:41.405 --> 41:42.806
had prepared a speech

41:42.840 --> 41:44.941
about the challenges
of coming home,

41:44.976 --> 41:47.845
but I'm afraid
he's had car trouble

41:47.879 --> 41:50.281
and isn't going
to make it here tonight.

41:50.315 --> 41:52.783
Fucking Brody.

41:52.818 --> 41:54.786
JESSICA:
Um, so I'm afraid

41:54.820 --> 41:57.855
this means you're stuck with me.

42:07.398 --> 42:09.833
Car trouble.

42:09.867 --> 42:13.269
Pretty sure, when he was
a prisoner in Iraq,

42:13.304 --> 42:15.005
he never thought
he'd have to deal

42:15.039 --> 42:17.774
with something so humdrum
as a flat tire again.

42:17.809 --> 42:19.243
(light laughter)

42:22.280 --> 42:25.382
You know, fund-raisers

42:25.416 --> 42:29.753
and political speeches
are great and everything,

42:29.787 --> 42:32.655
but I can't help thinking
one of the best ways

42:32.690 --> 42:37.026
to help our wounded warriors
starts with the family.

42:38.628 --> 42:43.799
Because one thing I do know--

42:43.833 --> 42:47.470
I'd have been able
to support my husband better

42:47.504 --> 42:50.073
if I'd been more ready.

42:52.510 --> 42:57.848
After eight years
of loneliness...

43:02.853 --> 43:05.254
...eight years
of not seeing each other...

43:08.625 --> 43:11.560
...if someone had warned me

43:11.595 --> 43:14.063
how he'd look at me...

43:16.300 --> 43:19.635
...as if he didn't know me
anymore...

43:22.473 --> 43:27.143
...how violent
his nightmares would be

43:27.177 --> 43:30.414
that he would attack me
in his sleep,

43:30.448 --> 43:33.049
um, how he didn't know
what to say to the kids

43:33.083 --> 43:35.451
those first few weeks,

43:35.485 --> 43:41.323
how hard intimacy of any kind
would be for him...

43:44.593 --> 43:50.231
If someone had actually
warned me in plain English

43:50.266 --> 43:54.569
how hard coming home
would be for him,

43:54.603 --> 43:59.074
that I'd need to adjust
my expectations...

44:01.578 --> 44:04.013
What I'm saying is,

44:04.047 --> 44:08.517
what if,
with some of this money,

44:08.551 --> 44:13.789
we could set up a place
where families could get ready

44:13.823 --> 44:18.093
for their veterans coming home?

44:18.128 --> 44:21.564
An actual place where they
can learn from other families

44:21.598 --> 44:25.468
who have been through...
who are still going through it.

44:29.439 --> 44:31.741
Because, in the end,

44:31.775 --> 44:34.977
we're all fighting
this war together.

44:40.517 --> 44:42.485
Thank you.

44:42.519 --> 44:44.987
Thank you very much.

44:57.466 --> 45:00.367
(grunting)

45:10.780 --> 45:13.349
You hardly said a
word the whole way.

45:13.383 --> 45:15.651
Want to talk about it?

45:18.156 --> 45:20.090
You coming in for a nightcap?

45:21.926 --> 45:23.727
Better not. It's late.

45:23.761 --> 45:26.229
I got an early start tomorrow.

45:35.840 --> 45:38.508
You've always
been there for me, Mike.

45:40.845 --> 45:43.413
You were amazing tonight.

45:47.784 --> 45:49.985
Good night.

45:50.020 --> 45:52.288
Hey.

45:52.322 --> 45:56.159
Maybe it was just car trouble.

45:56.193 --> 45:57.894
Maybe.

45:57.928 --> 45:59.428
I'm just saying,

45:59.463 --> 46:01.263
you might want to
cut him some slack.

46:01.298 --> 46:02.798
Cut him some slack?

46:02.832 --> 46:05.268
Hey, innocent until
proven guilty, Jess.

46:05.302 --> 46:07.336
Are you aware
that there was a weekend

46:07.371 --> 46:10.072
not long ago--
a whole weekend--

46:10.106 --> 46:12.307
where Brody just didn't
come home at all?

46:13.777 --> 46:15.477
You want to know why?

46:15.511 --> 46:17.379
He was with that CIA woman.

46:17.414 --> 46:18.781
The crazy one.

46:18.815 --> 46:20.482
You know,
let me be crystal clear.

46:20.517 --> 46:22.251
He was fucking the bitch

46:22.285 --> 46:23.686
for a whole weekend.

46:23.720 --> 46:25.922
And you want to know why
I'm having a problem

46:25.956 --> 46:27.924
believing this whole
car trouble story?

46:27.958 --> 46:30.126
Wait, back it up.

46:30.161 --> 46:32.195
He fucked who?

46:32.230 --> 46:34.598
I don't remember her name--
Carrie something.

46:34.632 --> 46:36.600
I don't know anymore.

46:44.475 --> 46:46.209
I thought you weren't coming in.

46:46.243 --> 46:49.145
Maybe just for one drink.

47:06.198 --> 47:07.665
(clears throat)

47:07.700 --> 47:09.000
(car door opens and closes)

47:18.677 --> 47:20.978
She kicked ass tonight, Brody.

47:21.012 --> 47:23.347
I mean, she was
fucking awesome.

47:25.750 --> 47:27.718
I don't doubt it.

47:27.752 --> 47:29.719
She's quite the hostess.

47:33.358 --> 47:34.925
No.

47:34.959 --> 47:38.162
I mean she got up there and she
gave a speech of her own.

47:40.966 --> 47:43.068
You did?

47:51.910 --> 47:54.378
I'll say good night, then.

48:10.661 --> 48:13.530
(car door opens and closes)

48:13.564 --> 48:15.566
(engine starts)

48:22.474 --> 48:23.540
Jesus.

48:26.444 --> 48:28.245
Where the hell have you been?

48:28.279 --> 48:29.579
You're soaking wet.

48:29.614 --> 48:31.181
It was raining.

48:32.484 --> 48:35.952
And there was no jack
in the car.

48:35.987 --> 48:39.455
Have you ever tried to change
a tire without a jack?

48:42.092 --> 48:44.827
Was there really a union meeting
in your district today?

48:44.861 --> 48:46.462
Yes.

48:48.599 --> 48:49.966
Where?

48:50.000 --> 48:52.736
What town?

48:54.372 --> 48:56.707
Don't answer that.

48:56.741 --> 48:58.909
I don't want to hear
another lie.

48:58.944 --> 49:00.611
I'm not lying.

49:00.645 --> 49:03.214
Oh, they just roll
off your tongue, don't they?

49:03.248 --> 49:04.948
One after the other.

49:04.983 --> 49:08.586
I really thought we turned
a corner this morning.

49:12.090 --> 49:14.157
You're hiding something.

49:14.192 --> 49:16.994
I can see it in your eyes.

49:18.296 --> 49:21.031
Now, either you tell me
what is going on...

49:21.065 --> 49:22.299
- There's nothing going...
- ...or I suggest

49:22.333 --> 49:25.202
you start looking
for a hotel room.

49:26.504 --> 49:28.472
And while you're at it,

49:28.506 --> 49:31.942
you give this marriage
some serious thought,

49:31.976 --> 49:35.112
because I don't think
I can do this anymore.

49:44.589 --> 49:46.757
(door closes)

50:01.071 --> 50:03.339
(door closes)

50:09.446 --> 50:11.414
(doorbell rings)

50:13.651 --> 50:15.652
(doorbell rings)

50:20.225 --> 50:22.693
(doorbell rings twice)

50:27.332 --> 50:29.534
(knocking on door)

50:35.207 --> 50:37.208
(knocking)

50:46.385 --> 50:48.687
(knocking)

50:51.224 --> 50:54.125
(doorbell rings)

50:54.159 --> 50:56.060
(knocking)

50:57.763 --> 50:59.964
(doorbell rings)

50:59.998 --> 51:01.833
Finally.

51:01.867 --> 51:03.768
You're not in Beirut?

51:03.802 --> 51:06.771
Came straight here
from the airport.

51:06.805 --> 51:08.272
I hear you were turned away

51:08.307 --> 51:10.408
from the debrief
at Langley today.

51:11.877 --> 51:13.678
I was the one
who recovered that intel.

51:13.712 --> 51:17.342
He wouldn't even
let me present it.

51:17.377 --> 51:20.652
Oh, I can only imagine how
shitty that must have felt.

51:20.686 --> 51:22.887
Still feels.

51:30.463 --> 51:32.464
(sighs)

51:36.869 --> 51:39.471
Before the Beirut trip,
I really thought

51:39.505 --> 51:43.542
I'd finally found a way to cope
with being out of The Company.

51:54.188 --> 51:56.790
Before you dig that
hole any deeper,

51:56.825 --> 51:59.626
I have to show you something.

51:59.661 --> 52:01.896
This your computer?

52:01.930 --> 52:03.464
Yeah.

52:06.969 --> 52:08.936
Here.

52:11.806 --> 52:13.940
You put it in.

52:13.975 --> 52:15.641
I'll only fuck it up.

52:15.676 --> 52:17.643
(laughing)

52:21.147 --> 52:23.949
This is the one piece of
intel you recovered in Beirut

52:23.983 --> 52:25.951
that Estes and his
mob haven't seen yet.

52:25.985 --> 52:27.519
I came straight
from the airport

52:27.554 --> 52:30.289
because I think you
deserve to see it first.

52:36.063 --> 52:39.099
My name is Nicholas Brody,

52:39.133 --> 52:42.736
and I'm a sergeant in the
United States Marine Corps.

52:42.770 --> 52:47.007
People will say I was broken,
I was brainwashed.

52:47.041 --> 52:50.544
People will say that
I was turned into a terrorist.

52:50.578 --> 52:52.146
Oh, my God.

52:52.180 --> 52:54.548
Taught to hate my country.

52:54.583 --> 52:56.650
My action this day

52:56.685 --> 53:00.255
is against
such domestic enemies.

53:00.289 --> 53:02.223
The vice president

53:02.257 --> 53:04.892
and members of his
national security team,

53:04.927 --> 53:07.328
who I know to be liars
and war criminals.

53:07.362 --> 53:08.896
I was right.

53:08.930 --> 53:11.032
Responsible for atrocities

53:11.066 --> 53:12.433
they were never
held accountable for.

53:12.467 --> 53:14.001
You were right.

53:14.036 --> 53:17.271
This is about justice
for 82 children

53:17.306 --> 53:19.474
whose deaths
were never acknowledged

53:19.508 --> 53:24.078
and whose murder is a stain
on the soul of this nation.

53:24.112 --> 53:27.515
And I want to tell you
about one of these children.

53:27.549 --> 53:30.418
I was right.
