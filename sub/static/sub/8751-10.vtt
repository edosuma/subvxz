WEBVTT

00:05.336 --> 00:09.536
I'm seeing a female losing her mind.

00:10.732 --> 00:14.122
There's a struggle on
whose house this is.

00:14.123 --> 00:17.258
I see attacks every day, every day.

00:17.259 --> 00:21.229
- We're kind of trapped.
- Then I hear "death".

00:21.230 --> 00:23.605
Do you think there's any
foul play involved here?

00:23.606 --> 00:25.167
It might be a poltergeist.

00:25.168 --> 00:27.753
I feel like it's watching me.

00:27.754 --> 00:30.656
"Mine, mine. Back the [Bleep] off".

00:30.657 --> 00:32.177
I want to have my home back.

00:32.179 --> 00:35.659
I encountered a poltergeist.

00:38.365 --> 00:40.677
They're being watched.

00:40.678 --> 00:43.585
My name is Amy Allan.

00:43.586 --> 00:45.836
This thing likes death.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.619
I see dead people.

00:47.620 --> 00:49.187
This thing is, like, a monster.

00:49.188 --> 00:51.257
I speak to dead people.

00:51.258 --> 00:52.947
And he's pissed off now.

00:52.948 --> 00:54.456
And they speak to me.

00:54.457 --> 00:56.052
His head was cracked.

00:56.053 --> 00:59.032
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:59.033 --> 01:01.082
This guy was murdered.

01:01.083 --> 01:02.501
I rely on my partner.

01:02.502 --> 01:03.905
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.906 --> 01:05.856
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

01:05.857 --> 01:08.574
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

01:08.575 --> 01:11.667
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:11.668 --> 01:14.580
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

01:14.581 --> 01:15.733
Why would you stay here?

01:15.734 --> 01:17.857
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.858 --> 01:19.841
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.842 --> 01:21.253
Until the very end.

01:21.254 --> 01:23.027
Stop it.

01:23.028 --> 01:25.191
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:25.192 --> 01:27.596
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

01:27.597 --> 01:28.961
Or time to get out.

01:28.962 --> 01:33.702
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074

01:48.497 --> 01:53.117
Amy and I investigate
each case separately.

01:54.148 --> 01:58.110
I uncover a property's history and
question the witnesses involved.

01:58.111 --> 02:01.711
While Amy talks to the dead.

02:02.724 --> 02:08.624
When we're done, we reveal our
findings to our client and each other.

02:16.862 --> 02:18.666
I'm in Westminster, Colorado.

02:18.667 --> 02:21.735
It's a sleepy little suburb
about 20 minutes north of Denver.

02:21.736 --> 02:25.539
I received a call from a woman
named Cara, who's a single mom.

02:25.540 --> 02:29.610
She tells me her entire family's
afraid to be in the house alone.

02:29.611 --> 02:31.912
She does not sound good.

02:31.913 --> 02:36.353
I'm hoping Amy and I can help her out.

02:46.847 --> 02:48.948
Before Amy can start her walk,

02:48.949 --> 02:54.200
I need to make sure she is free
from any outside influences.

02:54.201 --> 02:57.173
This house is filled with photographs
of a mother and her young children,

02:57.174 --> 03:00.473
that have to be covered or removed.

03:00.474 --> 03:04.434
When I'm finished, Amy can begin.

03:37.357 --> 03:41.437
I'm seeing a female freaking out...

03:42.702 --> 03:45.402
Losing her mind.

03:46.545 --> 03:50.325
Something with, like, the walls.

03:52.225 --> 03:55.261
I just see her jumping
around and, like, screaming

03:55.262 --> 03:58.669
and, like, then looking at the wall.

03:58.670 --> 04:04.570
The lady who's freaking out is
alive, and they're being attacked.

04:05.701 --> 04:09.061
It's really bad in here.

04:27.762 --> 04:30.523
Cara, I got to tell you... you
sounded pretty concerned on the phone.

04:30.524 --> 04:32.227
Uh, why don't you tell
me what's going on?

04:32.228 --> 04:37.104
Well, I'm a single parent, and I'm
here with my two children by myself.

04:37.105 --> 04:39.606
We have footsteps, voices.

04:39.607 --> 04:42.710
Um, we're seeing things, hearing
things, things are moving.

04:42.711 --> 04:45.279
- How old are your kids?
- 8 and 10.

04:45.280 --> 04:50.954
It's really hard to have a 10-year-old
who's very fearful in his own home, and...

04:50.955 --> 04:54.072
And just it definitely
has affected him the most.

04:54.073 --> 04:56.590
He won't go anywhere in the
home without somebody with him.

04:56.591 --> 04:58.358
How long has this been going on?

04:58.359 --> 05:02.129
The entire time that we've lived
here... about ten and a half years.

05:02.130 --> 05:05.652
However, when my ex-husband
moved out, the activity got worse.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.835
So that's why we called you in.

05:07.836 --> 05:11.067
What do you know about the house? I mean,
when was it built, anything like that?

05:11.068 --> 05:16.054
I know it was built in 1985. No
one's lived here more than two years.

05:16.055 --> 05:19.185
I'm the only one who has
stuck it out this long.

05:19.186 --> 05:22.294
You mentioned you were a nurse on the
phone, so what kind of a nurse are you?

05:22.295 --> 05:28.099
I'm a hospice nurse, dealing with people
who have six months or less to live.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.901
It's really emotionally draining.

05:29.902 --> 05:31.836
So, you're living here 10 years.

05:31.837 --> 05:35.840
You've been dealing with this almost ever
since you moved in. Dealt with a divorce.

05:35.841 --> 05:37.575
You're raising two kids on your own.

05:37.576 --> 05:39.744
I mean, how are you dealing with it?

05:39.745 --> 05:45.645
Well, it's incredibly stressful.
I want to have my home back.

05:48.403 --> 05:51.373
There is an old lady here.

05:51.374 --> 05:56.793
There is a relationship here with her
and this living woman who flipped out.

05:56.794 --> 06:00.926
She's tormented, and this old
lady... I think she's trying to help,

06:00.927 --> 06:03.584
but she doesn't even know
where to begin to help.

06:03.585 --> 06:05.271
To help what?

06:05.272 --> 06:09.472
Something is [Bleep] with people here.

06:09.911 --> 06:13.691
It might not be a dead person.

06:14.243 --> 06:17.663
It might be a poltergeist.

06:25.174 --> 06:27.306
So, what's going on in
this part of the house?

06:27.307 --> 06:30.741
When my son was younger, he
actually used to talk to a man

06:30.742 --> 06:35.952
that he saw in the ceiling
right over that chair over there.

06:35.953 --> 06:40.139
He would talk to him and tell
him to get down off the ceiling.

06:40.140 --> 06:42.454
And it was just really creepy.

06:42.455 --> 06:43.756
Wow. Okay.

06:43.757 --> 06:47.593
We've had 8 floods in the last 10 years.

06:47.594 --> 06:49.516
What kind of floods? What
are you talking about?

06:49.517 --> 06:52.269
Floods like pipes breaking,
sump pumps failing.

06:52.270 --> 06:55.839
We even had a manhole cover out
on the street flood my backyard.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.543
What about your neighbors?

06:57.544 --> 07:00.846
As far as I know, none
of them have had floods.

07:00.847 --> 07:02.192
Anything else going on?

07:02.193 --> 07:06.382
I had two groups come and investigate,
but they weren't really able to help me.

07:06.383 --> 07:07.784
They did some cleansing.

07:07.785 --> 07:10.693
They also did salt
crosses with the salt water

07:10.694 --> 07:14.241
and the lines in the doorway
to keep out the activity.

07:14.242 --> 07:16.283
So, did things get any
better after they left?

07:16.284 --> 07:21.204
No, nothing has worked.
We're kind of trapped.

07:27.538 --> 07:32.117
I feel that there's violence
inflicted on these people.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.987
That feeling of, like,
you've been, like, tortured.

07:35.988 --> 07:39.042
So far, this walk is really strange.

07:39.043 --> 07:41.044
I can tell someone is suffering,

07:41.045 --> 07:44.862
but whatever's responsible
won't reveal itself to me.

07:44.863 --> 07:50.323
There is really something
they're going through, but...

07:50.669 --> 07:53.829
But I don't know what it is.

07:53.830 --> 07:58.243
I feel their, like,
panic and their stress.

07:58.244 --> 08:01.696
Like, I almost feel like
someone's suicidal because of this.

08:01.697 --> 08:04.218
It's almost like in an
abusive relationship,

08:04.219 --> 08:05.989
and you're being beat every day.

08:05.990 --> 08:11.890
You're not afraid of it, you
know it's gonna happen anyways.

08:19.370 --> 08:21.218
So, what's going on in here?

08:21.219 --> 08:24.168
One of the first things that
I saw after moving in here

08:24.169 --> 08:28.425
was a big glowing orb come from
my bathroom while I was in bed.

08:28.426 --> 08:32.897
And it was bright, like the sun,
and it was big, almost person-size.

08:32.898 --> 08:36.499
And it stayed there for a long
time. It felt like forever.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.889
Okay, were you in bed alone?

08:37.890 --> 08:39.686
I actually was sleeping
with my son, Noah.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.861
I gotta ask you a question, though, do
you take any kind of sleeping medication,

08:42.861 --> 08:45.696
so you may get hallucinations
from it or anything like that?

08:45.697 --> 08:46.633
No.

08:46.634 --> 08:48.763
So, have you experienced
anything else in the room?

08:48.764 --> 08:52.433
I also have felt like something
was crawling up my bed,

08:52.434 --> 08:55.870
almost like someone was crawling
over me, going up the bed.

08:55.871 --> 08:58.977
I could feel the sheets
being pulled tight around me.

08:58.978 --> 09:01.594
Then I yelled at it to go away.

09:01.595 --> 09:04.097
- And did it stop?
- It did stop.

09:04.098 --> 09:07.113
After all you've told me, I find it
amazing that you could still live here,

09:07.114 --> 09:09.027
I mean, you don't have
a safe spot in the house.

09:09.028 --> 09:12.077
No. And I almost feel like I'm in a

09:12.078 --> 09:15.918
struggle on whose house this is.

09:26.675 --> 09:28.955
Oh [Bleep]

09:30.074 --> 09:32.294
Ooh. Ooh.

09:34.892 --> 09:36.812
Okay.

09:37.278 --> 09:41.681
Yeah, I feel like the
attack's every day, every day.

09:41.682 --> 09:45.352
Who the [Bleep] is doing this?

09:45.353 --> 09:51.253
I think that it's the beginnings
of a poltergeist manifestation.

09:52.747 --> 09:56.527
It's needing a lot of feeding.

09:57.565 --> 10:01.043
If this thing is fully
formed, can it hurt people?

10:01.044 --> 10:03.437
Yes, absolutely.

10:03.438 --> 10:07.166
You know, it can cut them, start fires.

10:07.167 --> 10:09.747
It could rape.

10:09.801 --> 10:12.123
And beat people.

10:12.124 --> 10:16.564
It can be very, very brutal and violent.

10:24.808 --> 10:30.708
I think that it's the beginnings
of a poltergeist manifestation.

10:32.516 --> 10:35.473
It can start fires...

10:35.474 --> 10:37.990
Rape and beat people.

10:37.991 --> 10:41.627
So, yeah, it can be very,
very brutal and violent.

10:41.628 --> 10:45.633
- You're pretty sure this is a poltergeist?
- Yes, absolutely.

10:45.634 --> 10:48.467
Poltergeists are usually
created unintentionally,

10:48.468 --> 10:53.129
when someone with psychic abilities
represses intense negative emotions.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.679
These entities can interact
with the physical world,

10:55.680 --> 11:00.246
and if the poltergeist develops,
it could become extremely dangerous.

11:00.247 --> 11:03.139
But this [Bleep] is, like...

11:03.140 --> 11:05.300
Mindless.

11:07.173 --> 11:13.073
Its creator is living, and it'll
do whatever the creator wants it to.

11:23.074 --> 11:24.704
So, Kymber, I was talking with mom,

11:24.705 --> 11:27.978
and I understand you and your brother
have had some experiences yourself.

11:27.979 --> 11:31.482
Yeah. There's been things
I've seen downstairs.

11:31.483 --> 11:35.319
I've heard footsteps in the stairs, and
I saw a witch on the wall over there.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.107
You saw a witch?

11:37.108 --> 11:40.717
You couldn't really see her face and...

11:40.718 --> 11:43.625
Her face was covered with black hair.

11:43.626 --> 11:48.204
So, this woman...
how'd she make you feel?

11:48.205 --> 11:51.541
I wanted to leave this room right now.

11:51.542 --> 11:55.585
I was just shaking and
hiding under the covers.

11:55.586 --> 11:58.622
How active is it in your
room, does it happen a lot?

11:58.623 --> 12:01.865
- Will you hear things?
- Well, it's not really active in my room.

12:01.866 --> 12:05.072
It's more active in Noah's room.

12:05.073 --> 12:08.392
And it's mostly active in my mom's room.

12:08.393 --> 12:10.313
Okay.

12:14.236 --> 12:17.416
There's this old lady.

12:17.617 --> 12:20.553
I get "grandma, grandma, grandma".

12:20.554 --> 12:23.434
She's here a lot.

12:27.050 --> 12:31.251
It doesn't feel as bad
as the other room...

12:31.252 --> 12:33.352
At all.

12:36.202 --> 12:39.502
It feels better in here.

12:39.862 --> 12:42.442
Safer in here.

12:43.371 --> 12:47.613
Uh because she's like,
she's always in here.

12:47.614 --> 12:52.417
I mean, she's trying to protect and
make it good for whoever's in here.

12:52.418 --> 12:54.119
What is she protecting against?

12:54.120 --> 12:55.387
I don't know.

12:55.388 --> 12:58.928
Something really, really bad.

13:11.927 --> 13:15.641
Kymber told me that her brother was
experiencing more activity in his room.

13:15.642 --> 13:17.109
According to their mom,

13:17.110 --> 13:20.212
Noah's actually afraid to be
alone anywhere in the house.

13:20.213 --> 13:22.895
I'm gonna have to hear his story.

13:22.896 --> 13:28.637
I'm scared to just be upstairs
alone by myself all the time.

13:28.638 --> 13:33.018
The one thing that scares me is that...

13:33.055 --> 13:36.835
Behind my door over there um...

13:37.407 --> 13:39.832
There's this thing that's...

13:39.833 --> 13:44.937
It's just very scary. Like,
I feel like it's watching me.

13:44.938 --> 13:47.517
- It's, like, a shadow kind of.
- Okay.

13:47.518 --> 13:51.804
And the edges of it are kind of like...
they kind of, like, fade a little bit.

13:51.805 --> 13:55.691
I don't know if it's...
it feels pretty negative.

13:55.692 --> 13:58.107
It doesn't seem very friendly.

13:58.108 --> 14:00.519
Okay, you having trouble
sleeping at night because of that?

14:00.520 --> 14:02.576
Yeah, it's...

14:02.577 --> 14:04.917
Very scary.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.220
Ooh. Ooh.

14:17.739 --> 14:19.199
Oh.

14:19.200 --> 14:24.000
Okay, we got something
with the closets here.

14:25.685 --> 14:28.320
Is it the same thing you
saw in the other closet?

14:28.321 --> 14:30.889
It's something different.

14:30.890 --> 14:33.563
But it's weird because it's every night.

14:33.564 --> 14:37.224
It's like a nightly creation.

14:44.631 --> 14:48.348
But I think that he's mostly seen as...

14:48.349 --> 14:52.669
Like, a shadow man or a shadow person.

14:53.001 --> 14:56.068
So, is this guy pretty
much just in the closet?

14:56.069 --> 15:00.095
I just get like it's
kind of his own space.

15:00.096 --> 15:03.996
And it does scare someone a lot.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.851
This is where he likes to
be, so it just so happens

15:09.852 --> 15:13.647
that whoever's in this room
would get more frightened

15:13.648 --> 15:19.228
than everybody else, because
he's more consistently here.

15:21.094 --> 15:22.895
One morning, I woke up.

15:22.896 --> 15:27.007
There was, like, a light, like somebody
was shining a flashlight under my door.

15:27.008 --> 15:30.332
And there's just, like, a little crack,
so you could barely, like, see it.

15:30.333 --> 15:31.289
Okay.

15:31.290 --> 15:36.453
So, I open the door, and it was like
a glowing, like, light, circle thing.

15:36.454 --> 15:42.354
I saw it for like a second or two and
I, like, scared it or something and it...

15:42.783 --> 15:43.769
Okay.

15:43.770 --> 15:46.071
Now, how you dealing with all
this stuff that's going on?

15:46.072 --> 15:48.374
I'm kind of very cautious of upstairs.

15:48.375 --> 15:52.657
Like, it's very hard
to be up here alone.

15:52.658 --> 15:56.738
Like, I always want Kymber with me.

15:57.118 --> 16:00.718
- It's really scary.
- Okay.

16:05.302 --> 16:07.932
This guy is the tormentor.

16:07.933 --> 16:11.722
So, there's a woman and then...

16:11.723 --> 16:14.081
This kid who he,

16:14.082 --> 16:16.307
really just torments.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.622
Like, I feel like he can
put weight on the bed.

16:19.623 --> 16:25.083
You know like, it feels like
somebody's sitting there.

16:27.865 --> 16:30.133
A lot of movement around him.

16:30.134 --> 16:33.554
I feel all of this dread.

16:33.786 --> 16:37.022
Do you know why he does that?

16:37.023 --> 16:41.076
This tormentor feels
like he's being invaded.

16:41.077 --> 16:43.111
So, what makes you say that?

16:43.112 --> 16:45.790
There was, like, this moment of, like...

16:45.791 --> 16:48.191
"Mine, mine.

16:48.361 --> 16:51.510
This is my people, mine".

16:51.511 --> 16:55.051
And, "back the [Bleep] off".

17:04.669 --> 17:07.646
Cara's house is only 27 years old.

17:07.647 --> 17:08.967
I looked into its history,

17:08.968 --> 17:11.785
and I couldn't find any deaths
associated with the property.

17:11.786 --> 17:14.585
So I'm headed over to meet with
a prominent real-estate developer

17:14.586 --> 17:20.465
to see what was on the land
before Cara's house was there.

17:24.330 --> 17:28.152
The house I'm investigating was built
in 1985, and I know you're a developer.

17:28.153 --> 17:31.971
Can you give me an idea what was
there prior to the houses being built?

17:31.972 --> 17:34.941
More or less, what was
there was just what you see.

17:34.942 --> 17:39.562
It was open farmland
for dry land grazing.

17:39.661 --> 17:41.378
Who owned the land back then?

17:41.379 --> 17:46.086
My grandfather, who, in 1869,
decided to start Church Ranch.

17:46.087 --> 17:48.888
It had to be tough back in
those days to get a farm going.

17:48.889 --> 17:54.647
Well, the standard worries were, obviously,
food and water to drink and shelter.

17:54.648 --> 17:57.685
Our family was very involved
in bringing the first water

17:57.686 --> 18:02.035
down from the Continental
Divide to this eastern slope.

18:02.036 --> 18:03.592
Life wasn't easy here.

18:03.593 --> 18:06.540
It was very challenging.
Farming's still challenging.

18:06.541 --> 18:10.767
You can have an accident, where somebody
gets hurt by a piece of machinery

18:10.768 --> 18:12.672
or falls into an irrigation ditch.

18:12.673 --> 18:14.189
That was not uncommon.

18:14.190 --> 18:16.592
Now, were they any deaths
associated with all that work?

18:16.593 --> 18:20.228
There were many deaths
associated with irrigation.

18:20.229 --> 18:23.157
One of the ones in this local
area that I've heard about

18:23.158 --> 18:29.058
was a fella by the name of John
Shannon that fell in and drowned.

18:37.383 --> 18:40.516
These two men are talking.

18:40.517 --> 18:46.277
Somebody's saying, "having a
problem keeping animals alive".

18:47.455 --> 18:49.366
They're very, very stressed out.

18:49.367 --> 18:51.409
Do you know what he's worried about?

18:51.410 --> 18:54.852
Then he's talking about
water, like water flow...

18:54.853 --> 18:57.760
And being ruined financially.

18:57.761 --> 18:59.708
- Why?
- Because the animals are dying.

18:59.709 --> 19:00.597
Okay.

19:00.598 --> 19:05.878
Well, one of the guys
looks kind of like that guy.

19:06.076 --> 19:09.121
This dead farmer is
angry that I'm seeing him.

19:09.122 --> 19:13.826
I realize now this guy is the
tormentor hiding in the kid's closet.

19:13.827 --> 19:18.054
He's just pretending to be a
shadow figure to protect his space.

19:18.055 --> 19:19.580
He's got a cowboy hat on.

19:19.581 --> 19:22.101
He's got a plaid button-down
long-sleeve shirt.

19:22.102 --> 19:25.882
He's got jeans and a belt on.

19:34.649 --> 19:39.809
He's created this monster
of himself from himself.

19:46.434 --> 19:49.071
I saw the word...

19:49.072 --> 19:51.172
"Death".

20:00.606 --> 20:03.608
I've managed to track down
a descendant of John Shannon,

20:03.609 --> 20:05.845
the man who died in a
local irrigation ditch.

20:05.846 --> 20:09.073
And she tells me her great-grandfather
lived a colorful life,

20:09.074 --> 20:12.794
and his death was no accident.

20:18.124 --> 20:20.975
So, I understand you're a
descendant of John Shannon's.

20:20.976 --> 20:23.306
Yes, I'm his great-granddaughter.

20:23.307 --> 20:27.833
Here's some pictures
of my great-grandfather.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.585
What can you tell me about him?

20:29.586 --> 20:33.865
The oldest boy, before he died, told my
grandma that he remembers he'd have to

20:33.866 --> 20:35.984
take the younger boys and
hide them down by the creek

20:35.985 --> 20:40.065
so their father wouldn't beat them.

20:40.247 --> 20:43.249
He was mean to the kids. He
was mean to the farm animals.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.117
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:45.118 --> 20:49.387
He had beat one of the horses so bad
that somebody had to pull him off.

20:49.388 --> 20:51.242
- You're kidding.
- No.

20:51.243 --> 20:56.078
And then I do remember hearing that
when the youngest child was a newborn,

20:56.079 --> 21:01.979
that the mother walked in and found
the father trying to smother the baby.

21:11.547 --> 21:13.578
The tormentor won't leave me alone,

21:13.579 --> 21:17.052
and he's following me
down to the basement.

21:17.053 --> 21:19.585
And I'm feeling like...
there's like a...

21:19.586 --> 21:24.256
I think this is a kid being,
like, held down and smothered.

21:24.257 --> 21:27.077
He can't breathe.

21:28.628 --> 21:30.721
Seeing uh...

21:30.722 --> 21:33.482
This dark mass...

21:37.066 --> 21:39.076
Standing...

21:39.077 --> 21:41.357
Smothering.

21:43.669 --> 21:49.309
There's just some psycho
[Bleep] going on in this house.

21:50.995 --> 21:54.321
I heard a rumor that he may have
drowned in a ditch. Is that correct?

21:54.322 --> 21:58.942
My great-grandfather
died in July of 1936.

21:59.316 --> 22:02.694
He didn't come home for supper one
night, and so my great-grandmother

22:02.695 --> 22:05.370
had some of the local
men out looking for him.

22:05.371 --> 22:09.377
And they found his hat and
jacket by the irrigation ditch.

22:09.378 --> 22:11.220
And they drained the ditch and somebody,

22:11.221 --> 22:14.032
went down in there and
brought the body out.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.781
And when I found the
death certificate here,

22:16.782 --> 22:19.078
it says the official cause is drowning.

22:19.079 --> 22:22.014
But it does leave the question of...

22:22.015 --> 22:24.850
Did he have a heart attack
and fall in the ditch or...

22:24.851 --> 22:27.421
Do you think there's any
foul play involved here?

22:27.422 --> 22:29.482
I've wondered about the oldest boy.

22:29.483 --> 22:30.894
In what way?

22:30.895 --> 22:33.434
Because he was very
devoted to his mother.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.493
The day that he ended up dead,

22:35.494 --> 22:39.613
there were people trying to get
the kids taken out of their custody.

22:39.614 --> 22:41.913
The day of his funeral,

22:41.914 --> 22:45.605
they all went home, and the oldest boy
said, "we don't ever talk about this".

22:45.606 --> 22:48.942
And great-grandma
never talked about it.

22:48.943 --> 22:50.803
Wow.

22:54.981 --> 22:57.149
And then that thing is behind me.

22:57.150 --> 22:58.607
What thing?

22:58.608 --> 23:01.810
The dead guy from upstairs.

23:01.811 --> 23:03.584
Okay.

23:03.585 --> 23:06.987
And is laughing hysterically.

23:06.988 --> 23:10.996
This tormentor from upstairs is furious
that I've seen through his disguise

23:10.997 --> 23:13.808
and can tell that he's not
actually a shadow figure.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.719
He clearly wants me to
get out of the house.

23:17.720 --> 23:22.100
He just followed me in from the garage.

23:23.676 --> 23:27.246
He's very, very, very angry.

23:27.247 --> 23:29.728
Oh, I don't feel good in here.

23:29.729 --> 23:32.746
This one's, like, really, really bad.

23:32.747 --> 23:36.121
He says, "oh, can't
breathe, can you? Ha ha".

23:36.122 --> 23:38.882
I can't breathe.

23:49.172 --> 23:51.295
After hearing about John Shannon,

23:51.296 --> 23:55.266
I needed to see if there's any other
suspicious deaths related to the property.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.568
As I'm looking through
the town's records,

23:57.569 --> 24:02.073
I found that a young newlywed, Gertrude
Weaver, used to live on Cara's land.

24:02.074 --> 24:07.311
She died while away on her
honeymoon, but the cause is unclear.

24:07.312 --> 24:11.007
Newspaper reports list three
different causes of death...

24:11.008 --> 24:15.590
Accident, suicide, and
homicide, all by gunshot.

24:15.591 --> 24:18.725
Now that I've got two mysterious
deaths on one property,

24:18.726 --> 24:24.626
I need to try to figure out
how Gertrude Weaver really died.

24:31.426 --> 24:35.446
I just saw, like, someone walk by.

24:40.212 --> 24:43.047
It was a woman, younger.

24:43.048 --> 24:45.583
She might just be some
residual or something.

24:45.584 --> 24:48.789
Like, there's no, like, interaction.

24:48.790 --> 24:52.390
Can you describe her at all?

24:57.897 --> 25:01.365
She's wearing a nightgown that's white

25:01.366 --> 25:04.797
with, like, little
design here or something

25:04.798 --> 25:08.390
and little poufy sleeves,
like these, kind of.

25:08.391 --> 25:11.151
Gaunt face, long.

25:11.664 --> 25:16.344
And I kind of did hear
"suicide" with her.

25:17.783 --> 25:20.371
All of the newspaper reports
say that Gertrude Weaver

25:20.372 --> 25:24.504
was shot by a gun her husband gave
her to use in case of an emergency.

25:24.505 --> 25:29.585
But the papers don't confirm if her death
was an accident, homicide, or suicide.

25:29.586 --> 25:31.704
So I'm meeting with
an antique gun expert

25:31.705 --> 25:36.865
who says he can help me
figure out what happened.

25:42.741 --> 25:45.774
Now, is this the same type of
weapon that killed Gertrude?

25:45.775 --> 25:48.175
Yes, it is.

26:03.551 --> 26:05.849
In your opinion, could
this have been an accident?

26:05.850 --> 26:09.757
To have an accidental shooting with one
of these would be extremely difficult.

26:09.758 --> 26:12.867
What if it was cocked back and it's
leaning up against the wall, for instance?

26:12.868 --> 26:14.712
If it falls, would it go off?

26:14.713 --> 26:17.367
The chances of it going
off are almost nil.

26:17.368 --> 26:18.870
It's not a hair trigger.

26:18.871 --> 26:21.835
You would actually have to pull the
trigger in order for the gun to go off.

26:21.836 --> 26:24.613
Okay, so we can rule out accidental.

26:24.614 --> 26:28.643
But as a general rule, women do
not kill themselves with a firearm.

26:28.644 --> 26:31.094
My opinion... somebody shot her.

26:31.095 --> 26:33.285
But we can't rule out suicide.

26:33.286 --> 26:35.842
Two reasons why I don't
think this was a suicide

26:35.843 --> 26:38.760
is the length of the rifle
and the weight of the rifle.

26:38.761 --> 26:40.605
Feel how heavy that is.

26:40.606 --> 26:42.749
Wow. It's heavier than it looks.

26:42.750 --> 26:44.599
It's a 12 to 13 pound rifle.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.808
I mean, a 21-year-old
small woman,

26:46.809 --> 26:50.672
you know, in order to hold it like this
and get shot center-mass in the heart...

26:50.673 --> 26:54.095
I mean, she'd have to be 6'8 with 4-foot
arms in order to do that to herself.

26:54.096 --> 26:55.428
Right.

26:55.429 --> 26:58.481
But people can be really resourceful,
and if she wanted to do it,

26:58.482 --> 27:00.301
- she could have rigged something.
- Yeah.

27:00.302 --> 27:02.751
She'd have to prop it
up somehow or rig it.

27:02.752 --> 27:04.663
I've seen people put
their toes in the friggin'

27:04.664 --> 27:06.885
trigger guard and blow their brains out.

27:06.886 --> 27:12.106
Who knows what was going
through this girl's head?

27:20.370 --> 27:22.793
During my walk, I
watched an old dead woman

27:22.794 --> 27:26.509
trying to protect a panicked living
woman from a dangerous entity.

27:26.510 --> 27:31.497
I'm working with a sketch
artist to describe what I saw.

27:31.498 --> 27:37.398
There is a woman who's kneeling
on the couch facing the wall.

27:39.289 --> 27:45.169
She has her hands up on the
top of the back of the couch.

27:45.221 --> 27:48.811
And then there's, like,
a little old lady who...

27:48.812 --> 27:51.632
Is standing close.

27:53.567 --> 27:55.267
- Describe this woman for me.
- Okay.

27:55.268 --> 27:59.748
She was pretty old, so
she's fairly wrinkled.

27:59.749 --> 28:03.949
And she's wearing big, thick glasses.

28:04.886 --> 28:07.763
Can you tell me anything
more about the hairstyle?

28:07.764 --> 28:12.264
It kind of stands up, but it curls back.

28:15.592 --> 28:18.712
Is this what you saw?

28:19.451 --> 28:21.311
Yes.

28:41.497 --> 28:44.556
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:44.557 --> 28:49.728
we're ready to reveal our
findings for the first time.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.697
Cara, it's good to see you again.

28:51.698 --> 28:54.277
I want to introduce
you to my partner, Amy.

28:54.278 --> 28:57.720
Cara lives here. She's a
single mom with two children.

28:57.721 --> 28:59.711
The three of them are
living in terror here.

28:59.712 --> 29:03.453
Her oldest son, Noah, is
probably the most affected by it.

29:03.454 --> 29:05.497
He's afraid to be in the house alone.

29:05.498 --> 29:08.833
He has to sleep with the light on,
can't have his friends over to the house,

29:08.834 --> 29:11.686
and she feels it's
destroying his childhood.

29:11.687 --> 29:13.771
With that being said, I'm
gonna turn it over to Amy,

29:13.772 --> 29:18.572
so we can hear a little
bit about her walk.

29:22.500 --> 29:26.295
When I walked into the
house, I saw a woman.

29:26.296 --> 29:28.214
She's a living person.

29:28.215 --> 29:30.449
And she was just flipping out.

29:30.450 --> 29:33.413
She was screaming and
yelling and out of control.

29:33.414 --> 29:37.914
I was seeing everything
through her eyes.

29:38.394 --> 29:44.294
The lady who's freaking out is
alive, and they're being attacked.

29:45.765 --> 29:49.125
It's really bad in here.

29:49.302 --> 29:54.725
The other person that was there was
this little old lady that is dead,

29:54.726 --> 29:58.110
and she's a conscious entity.

29:58.111 --> 30:02.981
I feel, definitely, a
female presence in the house.

30:02.982 --> 30:05.642
I did sketch the scene that I saw.

30:05.643 --> 30:08.357
- The scene of what? The two women?
- Of the two women.

30:08.358 --> 30:11.222
You saw the living woman
and the dead woman together?

30:11.223 --> 30:13.083
Yes.

30:16.012 --> 30:17.872
Wow.

30:23.752 --> 30:26.812
Take a look at that.

30:33.179 --> 30:36.184
So, the person in the
background is a living woman.

30:36.185 --> 30:40.526
And she was really being tormented
by whatever was happening.

30:40.527 --> 30:46.427
The impression I got was something moving
by or something that was scaring her.

30:47.501 --> 30:51.300
And this is the old lady who's dead.

30:51.301 --> 30:53.682
That's very scary.

30:53.683 --> 30:57.413
I'm a hospice nurse, and
so I deal with death...

30:57.414 --> 30:59.794
- All of the time.
- Oh, man.

30:59.795 --> 31:04.865
It could be a lady that I
had pass about a year ago...

31:04.866 --> 31:09.042
- Oh, wow.
- That I really cared about.

31:09.043 --> 31:11.759
She's very, very protective
of the lavender room

31:11.760 --> 31:14.590
and spends a large
amount of time in there...

31:14.591 --> 31:19.151
Uh, just sitting and
being, like, calming.

31:19.159 --> 31:21.205
That's your daughter's room,

31:21.206 --> 31:26.606
and she seems to be the
least affected in the house.

31:26.802 --> 31:29.437
There's another woman here.

31:29.438 --> 31:34.973
She was a younger woman and
she had long light-brown hair.

31:34.974 --> 31:39.954
And when she was walking
by, I heard "suicide".

31:40.004 --> 31:44.168
The house is only 27 years old,
so I looked into the land here.

31:44.169 --> 31:48.819
Where your house sits was part
of a big, huge 17,000-acre farm,

31:48.820 --> 31:50.270
set up into homesteads.

31:50.271 --> 31:54.068
And the turn of the century, there was
a woman by the name of Gertrude Weaver

31:54.069 --> 31:57.210
who lived on the farmland here.

31:57.211 --> 32:00.031
This is her here.

32:02.204 --> 32:04.416
One day, they found her dead.

32:04.417 --> 32:06.382
She was shot in the chest.

32:06.383 --> 32:10.957
So, the newspaper articles on
Gertrude's death listed three causes...

32:10.958 --> 32:14.126
Accidental, suicide, and homicide.

32:14.127 --> 32:17.428
I consulted with a rifle expert,
and he ruled out accidental.

32:17.429 --> 32:20.749
But, in my opinion as
a homicide investigator,

32:20.750 --> 32:24.721
I'm leaning towards homicide,
but I can't rule out suicide...

32:24.722 --> 32:28.562
- Whoa.
- Because it's possible.

32:28.710 --> 32:31.369
Is she dangerous to Cara and her family?

32:31.370 --> 32:32.527
No.

32:32.528 --> 32:37.091
But the next individual that I
encountered I believe is responsible

32:37.092 --> 32:42.612
for everything that is going
on in the house that's negative.

32:42.613 --> 32:45.487
He is the tormentor.

32:45.488 --> 32:49.812
I saw him trying to hold
down and smother a child.

32:49.813 --> 32:54.187
And then he made me feel
like I couldn't breathe.

32:54.188 --> 32:59.961
If somebody were to perceive him, it
would look more like a shadow person.

32:59.962 --> 33:05.862
He can go anywhere he wants in the house,
but he loves the blue room's closet.

33:06.297 --> 33:11.043
This is where he likes to be, so it just
so happens that whoever's in this room

33:11.044 --> 33:14.565
would get more frightened
than everybody else,

33:14.566 --> 33:17.023
because he's more consistently here.

33:17.024 --> 33:20.368
That describes what's going on
with your son to a "T" almost.

33:20.369 --> 33:25.064
Yeah, he sees a shadow person
beside his door all the time...

33:25.065 --> 33:25.983
Okay.

33:25.984 --> 33:29.168
Kind of like a blurry
edged shadow person.

33:29.169 --> 33:29.969
Mm hmm.

33:29.970 --> 33:35.244
And I can't even close the
door without him screaming.

33:35.245 --> 33:38.315
So, I go out into the backyard.

33:38.316 --> 33:43.456
And I actually get to see his
true self when he was alive.

33:43.457 --> 33:45.883
He seemed to be some
type of farmer or rancher.

33:45.884 --> 33:50.325
He was really, really stressed
out about his water source

33:50.326 --> 33:55.457
and water issues that were
happening at that time.

33:55.458 --> 33:57.728
We have water issues.

33:57.729 --> 34:01.178
I've had 8 separate floods
in 10 years in my home.

34:01.179 --> 34:03.901
Fixed pipes, multiple sump pumps,

34:03.902 --> 34:06.169
and then when everything
was fixed in the basement,

34:06.170 --> 34:09.505
a manhole cover flooded my
basement, not any of my neighbors.

34:09.507 --> 34:12.014
None of my neighbors
have had the issues.

34:12.014 --> 34:17.415
Most people lived here only
two years, except for me.

34:18.248 --> 34:22.993
He really believes that this is his
home, that you're his possessions,

34:22.994 --> 34:25.021
and he...

34:25.022 --> 34:27.542
Is an abuser.

34:27.828 --> 34:30.712
Amy, let me tell you about
this guy John Shannon.

34:30.713 --> 34:32.793
He was a lousy farmer.

34:32.795 --> 34:38.135
And his biggest worries was
irrigation and the water.

34:40.456 --> 34:43.342
- This is him as a farmer.
- Oh.

34:43.342 --> 34:47.483
- All right? And this is him.
- Oh.

34:48.103 --> 34:51.783
- There's a better photo of him up close.
- Whoa.

34:51.784 --> 34:56.489
I talked to his great-granddaughter,
and she told me...

34:56.491 --> 34:59.614
He beat a horse so bad, people
had to pull him off the horse.

34:59.615 --> 35:02.015
Oh, my God.

35:02.053 --> 35:04.419
Matter of fact, he abused his kids.

35:04.420 --> 35:07.418
And it got to the point
where the older kids,

35:07.419 --> 35:09.923
would take the younger kids and
hide them when he'd come home,

35:09.924 --> 35:12.460
because they were so afraid
of him beating them down.

35:12.461 --> 35:15.920
The state was gonna come and take,

35:15.921 --> 35:21.069
his eight children away from him and
his wife because he was so abusive.

35:21.070 --> 35:23.982
John Shannon dies in July of 1936.

35:23.983 --> 35:28.183
And I got the death certificate here.

35:28.544 --> 35:31.954
His cause of death is drowning.

35:31.955 --> 35:36.040
And they find him in a water ditch.

35:36.041 --> 35:38.976
The great-granddaughter thinks
that maybe somebody murdered him.

35:38.977 --> 35:43.306
She had the feeling that the
oldest boy might have done it.

35:43.307 --> 35:47.327
But do you think this is the guy?

35:49.354 --> 35:51.334
I do.

35:56.855 --> 36:00.677
The part that really concerned me was...

36:00.678 --> 36:05.838
I encountered the beginnings
of a PK manifestation.

36:06.956 --> 36:11.276
That is a branch off of a poltergeist.

36:14.485 --> 36:17.834
These things cut people...

36:17.835 --> 36:20.290
Beat people up...

36:20.291 --> 36:24.671
And it could also possibly kill someone.

36:34.474 --> 36:39.634
I encountered the beginnings
of a PK manifestation.

36:41.221 --> 36:45.541
That is a branch off of a poltergeist.

36:48.160 --> 36:51.509
These things cut people...

36:51.510 --> 36:53.922
Beat people up...

36:53.923 --> 36:58.303
And it could also possibly kill someone.

36:58.343 --> 37:00.937
Now, what happens
with a PK manifestation

37:00.938 --> 37:05.806
is that it stems from a
living agent at the location.

37:05.807 --> 37:08.390
It's just purely the person's energy.

37:08.391 --> 37:10.626
It's not something you can see.

37:10.627 --> 37:14.438
These things feed off of negativity.

37:14.439 --> 37:19.168
Fear, anger, depression become
absorbed immediately into this.

37:19.169 --> 37:24.209
And then it starts to
actually create an entity.

37:25.650 --> 37:29.366
It was initially created by a female.

37:29.367 --> 37:32.589
Who's going through a very intense time.

37:32.590 --> 37:35.882
Do you know who formed
it or helped form it?

37:35.883 --> 37:37.628
Well, I think that it's...

37:37.629 --> 37:39.835
Yeah, probably me then.

37:39.836 --> 37:42.132
I have been through a lot of stress.

37:42.133 --> 37:44.053
Okay.

37:45.083 --> 37:48.683
So, does Cara have abilities?

37:48.733 --> 37:50.593
Yes.

37:51.022 --> 37:54.082
And so does her son.

37:55.552 --> 37:58.236
So, you have abilities...

37:58.237 --> 38:02.489
You're in the house with dead people.

38:02.490 --> 38:06.684
And you're under a
great amount of stress.

38:06.685 --> 38:09.925
It's the perfect storm.

38:14.496 --> 38:17.965
Well, Cara, this is obviously
not what you wanted to hear,

38:17.966 --> 38:21.558
but the investigations
did give you the answers

38:21.559 --> 38:23.857
as to why it's happening,
what's going on.

38:23.858 --> 38:27.465
The big question is, though... is it safe
for you and your children to stay here?

38:27.466 --> 38:32.026
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

38:32.686 --> 38:35.121
So, I do believe that you can stay.

38:35.122 --> 38:36.778
Good, good.

38:36.779 --> 38:39.178
Because I can't sell this place.

38:39.179 --> 38:42.918
But there are a few things
that you'll have to do.

38:42.919 --> 38:47.107
The first thing I want to
talk about is cleansing.

38:47.108 --> 38:51.403
Once a week, you physically clean
your house from top to bottom.

38:51.404 --> 38:53.695
When you say to clean
the house top to bottom,

38:53.696 --> 38:56.452
you're talking about actually
cleaning it, like washing and cleaning,

38:56.453 --> 38:59.217
- mopping the floor, and vacuuming?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

38:59.218 --> 39:03.139
With your situation, the
cleansing is more for,

39:03.140 --> 39:06.654
getting rid of the residual
energy that's collected.

39:06.655 --> 39:08.554
Mm-hmm.

39:08.555 --> 39:10.769
When people experience intense trauma,

39:10.770 --> 39:15.060
toxic residual energy can pile
up in their environment like dust.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.873
By cleaning the surfaces of her home,

39:16.874 --> 39:20.609
Cara will wash these layers
of negative energy away.

39:20.610 --> 39:26.510
So, you clean the space out and then
you're going to deal with this guy.

39:27.443 --> 39:32.135
The way that I would suggest doing that
is getting a physical medium in here.

39:32.136 --> 39:35.596
And you're going to
work with that person on,

39:35.597 --> 39:40.178
visualizing him out of the
house to move him out and on.

39:40.179 --> 39:44.859
Exert your power, let
him know who's boss.

39:45.419 --> 39:48.329
After he's gone, am I gonna
still feel him, that's the thing,

39:48.330 --> 39:49.971
- or is it just gonna feel...
- Oh, no.

39:49.972 --> 39:53.185
Because you're gonna do this
with the physical medium.

39:53.186 --> 39:57.703
You're gonna be there 100%
with your abilities, as well.

39:57.704 --> 40:03.604
You're gonna get rid of him, so
you're not gonna feel that anymore.

40:06.535 --> 40:10.703
- What about the old lady?
- She actually is here to try to help.

40:10.704 --> 40:15.998
I mean, it's good for her to be
here right now until he's gone.

40:15.999 --> 40:20.002
She'll be taken care of, like, kind
of inadvertently through this process.

40:20.003 --> 40:23.028
And then the last thing is
dealing with the PK manifestation,

40:23.029 --> 40:27.212
that's, you know,
upstairs in your closet.

40:27.213 --> 40:30.836
What you want to do is a
little bit of counseling,

40:30.837 --> 40:33.269
just to work out those past issues.

40:33.270 --> 40:37.048
So, you're taking it outside
of the house to a person...

40:37.049 --> 40:38.691
- Rather than in here.
- Right.

40:38.692 --> 40:41.768
And you're verbalizing
it out to that therapist.

40:41.769 --> 40:44.039
Will it ever go away?

40:44.040 --> 40:45.572
Um, no.

40:45.573 --> 40:51.114
I mean, it, very slowly over a very
long period of time, could dissipate.

40:51.115 --> 40:54.526
So as long as you keep
it stunted, it's great.

40:54.527 --> 40:56.926
What about this guy John Shannon?

40:56.927 --> 41:02.747
Till this stuff gets resolved,
are they gonna be all right?

41:04.886 --> 41:08.671
Yes. You know your power over him.

41:08.672 --> 41:12.947
And so you just need to start
exerting that like nobody's business.

41:12.948 --> 41:15.743
And also tell your
children to do the same.

41:15.744 --> 41:18.846
- So you're empowering them.
- Mm hmm.

41:18.847 --> 41:21.682
Well, Cara, you're gonna
do what she tells you.

41:21.683 --> 41:25.043
- Definitely, yes.
- Okay.

41:27.823 --> 41:33.460
I truly believe the PK manifestation
poses a dangerous threat to Cara's family.

41:33.461 --> 41:36.581
If she follows the steps I
outlined, it will slowly dissolve,

41:36.582 --> 41:41.028
and she and her two kids can
live in their home in peace.
