WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:07.575
(birds chirping)

00:07.608 --> 00:10.411
(British accent):
This spot looks good.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.712
(British accent):
Smells awful.

00:11.745 --> 00:15.783
Oh. That's the sulfur
from the mine's runoff.

00:15.816 --> 00:18.552
You saw what they were
dumping upstream.

00:18.586 --> 00:21.822
Bet you we find acid
and radon levels off the charts.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.691
Assuming we don't
get killed first.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.427
Oh, please, Doug,
don't start again.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.795
Please, Julie.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.663
I think I've earned
the right to complain.

00:29.697 --> 00:32.166
Do you know many husbands who'd
agree to be chained to a tree

00:32.200 --> 00:33.167
on their honeymoon?

00:33.201 --> 00:34.735
That wasn't just a tree.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.738
That was an old-growth forest
that was being illegally logged.

00:37.771 --> 00:40.374
Yeah. And who was
right there by your side

00:40.408 --> 00:43.677
blocking that whaling ship with
nothing but an inflatable raft?

00:43.711 --> 00:46.747
You gonna whine or help me check
the water for particulates?

00:46.780 --> 00:49.049
I can multitask.

00:50.618 --> 00:51.652
And then I'm done.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.087
I draw the line

00:53.121 --> 00:55.089
at lawless
South American jungles.

00:55.123 --> 00:58.259
Did you hear a word that guide
said when he dropped us off?

00:58.292 --> 01:00.294
Between the local rebel groups
and the drug lords,

01:00.328 --> 01:01.762
we're gonna get ourselves
killed this time.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.632
Nobody's getting killed.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.634
The most dangerous thing
out here is this water.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.844
*

01:47.541 --> 01:49.410
This is no ordinary case.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.644
It involves one of our own.

01:50.678 --> 01:52.713
I need everyone
at the top of their game.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.782
I'm always
at the top of my game.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.484
I like your attitude, Torres.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.186
But you're sitting this one out.

01:58.219 --> 02:01.789
Quinn, can I count on you
for drinks and balloons?

02:01.822 --> 02:02.723
On it.

02:02.756 --> 02:05.326
Hey. What's,
uh, going on?

02:05.359 --> 02:07.728
Nothing that concerns you.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.598
You men are not invited
to this baby shower.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.766
Um, I think Delilah's
baby shower does concern me.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.801
And Delilah as well.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.336
FYI, men do go to baby showers.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.637
This is not the time to argue.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.705
I'm not.

02:17.738 --> 02:18.939
Us girls have this
totally covered,

02:18.972 --> 02:20.441
so you can just go relax.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.642
Okay.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.278
I just scored down in evidence.

02:24.312 --> 02:27.581
And there are two more boxes
of decorations down there.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.950
Mm-hmm.
Tried to return them

02:29.983 --> 02:32.786
to the original owner, but
they said to toss them, so...

02:32.820 --> 02:35.356
You know I love recycling.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.791
Those are from a domestic
dispute case; you remember that?

02:37.825 --> 02:39.860
The two cousins
that, uh,

02:39.893 --> 02:42.263
argued over the baby's name,
shot each other.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.365
And this is why men aren't
invited to baby showers.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.766
And this is why
I don't have kids.
(phone chimes)

02:45.799 --> 02:49.303
Oh, who needs kids
when you have Mom?

02:49.337 --> 02:50.804
McGEE: Look, Abby, I appreciate
everything you're doing, okay?

02:50.838 --> 02:52.773
But I need to check
with Delilah.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.842
Who wears the pants
in the family, mate?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.777
This has nothing to do with--
No, I'm...

02:56.810 --> 02:59.280
I'm saying that we just need
to slow down here, okay?

02:59.313 --> 03:00.981
Maybe Delilah's sister
wants to throw the shower.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.983
Maybe Delilah wants
to wait a little longer.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.419
Nope, clock's ticking.
I know!

03:07.755 --> 03:09.923
I mean, I know.

03:15.796 --> 03:16.930
It's okay.

03:18.566 --> 03:22.002
You're gonna be
a fantastic father.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.637
GIBBS: And now
it's time to be

03:23.671 --> 03:25.739
a fantastic agent, Tim.

03:25.773 --> 03:26.840
MTAC.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.909
Right now. Let's go.

03:30.911 --> 03:33.814
(stuffy): Agent Gibbs,
nice to finally meet you.

03:33.847 --> 03:34.948
McGee, long time no see.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.550
How you been, Taggart?

03:36.584 --> 03:38.286
Horrible.

03:38.319 --> 03:41.021
The humidity in Jacksonville
was wreaking havoc on my sinuses

03:41.054 --> 03:43.557
so I requested a transfer.

03:43.591 --> 03:46.026
And where did the geniuses
at HQ send me?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.928
The embassy in Paraguay.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.797
I have to stick my head
in the dryer

03:49.830 --> 03:51.732
if I want to take
a deep breath.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.268
That why you
called us, Taggart?

03:54.302 --> 03:56.036
Give us an update
on your sinuses?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.471
No.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.006
Because of this.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.876
Two chemists found it while

04:02.910 --> 04:05.846
doing an environmental survey
of a uranium mine down here.

04:05.879 --> 04:08.349
They turned it into the local
police, who ran the prints

04:08.382 --> 04:10.884
through their immigration
fingerprinting system.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.820
Who is it?

04:12.853 --> 04:16.390
Prints were a match for
a Petty Officer Matthew Dean.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.792
Several more body parts
washed up on the bank

04:18.826 --> 04:20.761
near where the hand was found.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.830
We presume it's the rest of him.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.798
It's all on its way to you now.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.934
Was Dean deployed to Paraguay?

04:26.967 --> 04:30.003
No, he'd recently entered
the country on a tourist visa.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.004
Alone?

04:31.038 --> 04:32.573
You know as much as we do.

04:32.606 --> 04:36.043
The area he was found in
is fairly lawless.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.379
It's hard to get good info.
All we know is

04:38.412 --> 04:39.913
he shouldn't have
been here at all.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.883
State issued a travel advisory
for American citizens

04:42.916 --> 04:44.985
three weeks ago
due to rebel activity.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.887
Well, those are just guidelines.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.524
Can't stop an American citizen
from traveling if they want to.

04:50.558 --> 04:52.393
Regular citizens, no.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.962
But military personnel
were forbidden.

04:54.995 --> 04:57.931
Dean violated orders
when he came down here.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.900
Which begs the question...

04:59.933 --> 05:02.570
What the hell was
he doing there?

05:11.111 --> 05:14.782
Petty Officer First Class
Matthew Dean, 28 years old.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.050
Finished his BUD/SEAL
training in '09.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.586
BISHOP: And that is
pretty much all we know.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.921
SEAL records are need-to-know.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.991
And right now Quinn is at the
Pentagon trying to dig up more.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.926
He married?
TORRES: To his
childhood sweetheart.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.061
His Facebook profile

05:28.095 --> 05:30.598
says his favorite
performers are The Doors

05:30.631 --> 05:31.799
and, uh, Meat Loaf.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.367
He has no kids.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.935
Anything link him to Paraguay?

05:34.968 --> 05:37.004
No, but we do have a theory

05:37.037 --> 05:39.106
on what he might've been
doing there.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.442
Also courtesy of Facebook,

05:41.475 --> 05:44.378
we learned that Dean once
sailed across the Pacific.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.078
Alone.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.814
McGEE:
And before that,

05:46.847 --> 05:48.649
he summited
Mount Kilimanjaro.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.618
Also alone.
Oh, a man after my own heart.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.686
Except for the mountain climbing
and the sailing.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.455
And, uh, the Meat Loaf.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.690
Hey, I like Meat Loaf.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.726
Why are we talking
about Meat Loaf?

05:58.759 --> 06:00.428
You got a theory
or not?

06:00.461 --> 06:01.829
We do.

06:01.862 --> 06:02.996
Boss, this is
the Paraguay River.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.399
It's not quite
the Amazon,

06:05.433 --> 06:07.034
but it's got some
pretty serious rapids,

06:07.067 --> 06:08.536
especially if you're into
that sort of thing.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.570
And Petty Officer Dean
is very much

06:09.603 --> 06:11.572
into that
sort of thing.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.707
There are dozens of photos taken
of him on these rafting trips.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.743
TORRES: Yeah, we're thinking
he went down to Paraguay

06:15.776 --> 06:17.778
for his latest eco-adventure.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.112
Against orders?

06:19.146 --> 06:20.581
Work in progress.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.651
Keep working.

06:23.684 --> 06:24.918
Bishop, talk to the wife.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.587
See what she knows.

06:29.590 --> 06:32.726
When the Navy officers
showed up at my door,

06:32.760 --> 06:34.962
before they'd even said a word,
I knew.

06:34.995 --> 06:38.932
I've woken from that same
nightmare 100 times before,

06:38.966 --> 06:41.635
but this time...

06:41.669 --> 06:43.904
I can't seem to wake up.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.806
We understand.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.075
Every time he deployed,
I couldn't sleep.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.777
It's ironic.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.813
I always worried he'd
get killed in a shoot-out

06:52.846 --> 06:57.551
or... parachuting
into a war zone.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.921
Never did I think he'd
die on a fishing trip.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.892
That's what he was doing
in Paraguay, fishing?

07:06.093 --> 07:07.895
Paraguay?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.563
BISHOP:
Yeah, that's uh...

07:09.597 --> 07:12.032
that's where his remains
were found.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.637
Where did you think he was?

07:16.670 --> 07:20.207
Canada, on a, on a fishing trip.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.709
Alone?

07:21.742 --> 07:23.711
That wasn't unusual.

07:23.744 --> 07:24.912
After every deployment,

07:24.945 --> 07:29.016
he'd take a trip to...
decompress.

07:29.049 --> 07:33.654
Some place with no TVs,
no cell phones...

07:33.687 --> 07:35.255
no people.

07:35.288 --> 07:38.158
And then, when he
would come home,

07:38.191 --> 07:40.794
he would be
my Matty again.

07:41.862 --> 07:45.599
He said he was going to Canada.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.268
What was he doing
back in Paraguay?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.571
Wait, what do you mean
"back in Paraguay"?

07:50.604 --> 07:51.972
He's been there before?

07:54.775 --> 07:57.845
Look, if there's
something you know,

07:57.878 --> 08:00.213
we should know that, too.

08:02.583 --> 08:06.520
I know that he was in Paraguay
on his last SEAL mission.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.955
Doing what?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.558
That I don't know.
He couldn't tell me.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.660
He shouldn't have even
told me where he was,

08:12.693 --> 08:14.528
much less what the mission was.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.766
But I know who does know.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.168
JOSEPHSON:
Yes, I was Dean's commander

08:21.201 --> 08:22.703
for his last SEAL mission.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.805
But that's all
I'm at liberty to say.

08:24.838 --> 08:29.543
Though, I'll add, his loss is
a gut-punch on the rhino farm.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.178
I'll do anything I can to help.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.681
We need to know what
you were doing in Paraguay.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.816
(laughs) No can do, sport.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.651
That's need-to-know.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.052
So much for that help.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.320
Sorry, Chippy.

08:40.353 --> 08:41.889
You want operational details,

08:41.922 --> 08:43.991
you're gonna have to go
through the proper channels.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.292
We are.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.595
Budget cuts to
the State Department

08:47.628 --> 08:49.730
leave them understaffed;
it's taking forever.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.732
You think you got problems?

08:51.765 --> 08:54.802
I'm back in Mosul again, Ace,
as in Iraq.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.937
I'd rather be stuck
in an elevator

08:56.970 --> 08:58.972
with Justin Bieber
than back here.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.074
(chuckles):
Hell, I'd rather be...

09:01.108 --> 09:02.843
When was the last time
you talked to Dean?

09:02.876 --> 09:03.844
Well, let's see.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.079
Called me about three weeks ago.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.716
Invited me on a fishing trip
he was taking with Charlie.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.784
"Charlie." Is that
an actual person's name

09:10.818 --> 09:12.720
or is that just another nick...?

09:12.753 --> 09:13.921
Petty Officer Charlie Hudson.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.823
A fellow SEAL.

09:15.856 --> 09:18.626
Unfortunately, I wouldn't
have been back in time to go.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.861
(quietly): Boss,
Dean told his wife he was

09:20.894 --> 09:22.062
going on that
fishing trip alone.

09:22.095 --> 09:25.132
Did Dean say anything else
about the trip?

09:25.165 --> 09:27.134
That's all I got for you.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.838
Petty Officer Hudson-- need
to talk to him. Where is he?

09:30.871 --> 09:31.972
Don't know.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.941
And good luck finding him.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.777
He's discharged,
he lives in a motorhome,

09:36.810 --> 09:38.812
and he never parks
in the same place twice.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.614
BOLO, on it.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.816
Thanks for all your help,
Skippy.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.622
Well, here's a thigh.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.791
And a leg.

09:50.824 --> 09:52.325
I got a wing.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.694
(laughing)

09:53.727 --> 09:55.162
That's classic.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.097
Goodfellas? Joe Pesci?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.832
(imitating Joe Pesci):
"What do you like?

09:58.866 --> 10:00.367
You like the leg or you
like the wing, Henry?"

10:00.400 --> 10:02.302
Dr. Palmer,
I haven't the faintest idea

10:02.335 --> 10:04.271
what you're talking about,

10:04.304 --> 10:06.774
but we are dealing here
with a combat veteran.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.776
I would hope that you show
a little more respect.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.277
You're right, of
course, Dr. Mallard.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.112
I-I realized that the
second that I said it.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.682
It was totally inappropriate.
Good.

10:14.715 --> 10:18.118
(imitating Joe Pesci):
"Now go get your shine box."

10:18.151 --> 10:19.386
You've seen Goodfellas.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.888
Yes.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.956
That was one compelling movie.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.925
Actually, I saw it
with Gibbs.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.860
Really?
Gibbs sees movies?

10:26.894 --> 10:28.862
Like, made after 1957?

10:28.896 --> 10:30.363
What's your point?

10:30.397 --> 10:33.233
Whoa. That was an impressively
quiet entrance.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.903
Wow.

10:35.936 --> 10:36.837
This all there is?

10:36.870 --> 10:39.406
Yes. And the lack of a skull

10:39.439 --> 10:42.843
rules out confirming
Petty Officer Dean's identity

10:42.876 --> 10:44.077
using dental records.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.078
Abby, however,

10:45.112 --> 10:46.947
is running DNA tests,

10:46.980 --> 10:52.219
and I made a positive match
of this tattoo with a photo

10:52.252 --> 10:53.954
from Dean's medical records.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.057
Got a cause of death?

10:57.090 --> 10:58.892
Well, you're asking me

10:58.926 --> 11:01.461
if his dismemberment
was pre- or postmortem.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.263
That I can't tell you, yet.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.933
But whenever it was,

11:05.966 --> 11:08.101
it was caused by
some kind of machete.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.838
More specifically, a very
angry man with a machete.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.339
Not necessarily.

11:12.372 --> 11:14.074
Tribal witch doctors
have been known

11:14.107 --> 11:16.409
to hunt down albinos,

11:16.443 --> 11:20.013
and then hack off body parts
to use for certain potions,

11:20.047 --> 11:22.415
uh, to cure a variety of ills.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.951
Not albino, Duck.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.119
Lot of good it did him.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.989
I'm afraid that's all
we have for you now.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.357
I got something.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.259
The BOLO on Petty Officer
Charlie Hudson's

11:32.292 --> 11:33.994
motorhome came back.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.963
Yeah? So what are you
still doing here?

11:35.996 --> 11:40.033
You know, you don't fool me.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.005
(whispers):
I know you like me.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.012
I know you like me, too.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.048
Oh, yeah?

11:55.082 --> 11:58.451
I'm getting less and less
certain by the second.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.920
(clears throat)

12:05.859 --> 12:08.061
Park ranger said
it's been here about two weeks.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.396
Any sign of Petty
Officer Hudson?

12:09.429 --> 12:11.098
Not since he parked here.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.934
Said he actually paid up front,
only one week, though.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.770
Park ranger actually said
he just called the tow truck.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.438
Well, in that case,
we're free to enter.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.842
All right, let me go in first.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.076
Why?

12:23.110 --> 12:25.813
You're gonna be a father, man.
Look, I never wanted a kid,

12:25.846 --> 12:28.215
but if I did, I'd want to see
his first soccer game

12:28.248 --> 12:29.850
and meet his first girlfriend,
all right?

12:29.883 --> 12:32.820
Let's just watch your back.
Could be anything inside.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.255
I appreciate that, okay? But
that's what I got the gun for,

12:35.288 --> 12:37.457
and 14 years of on-the-job
professional training.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.827
All right, roger that.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.228
Just looking out for you, bro.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.462
I know.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.975
TORRES:
Clear.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.309
It's not the word I would use.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.978
I mean, this place is a mess.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.914
I found a travel memo
for Hudson.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.416
Let me guess, Paraguay.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.853
Round-trip ticket.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.254
Left two weeks ago.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.057
Looks like he went fishing
with his buddy Dean, after all.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.528
What do you think were they
planning on catching with these?

13:15.562 --> 13:17.064
Night vision goggles.

13:17.097 --> 13:18.798
Look at that.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.601
Detonators.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.170
Looks like they took
most of them.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.006
You know, I'm not
much of a fisherman.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.041
Fish, water-- it's not my thing.

13:28.075 --> 13:31.444
But whatever these guys
were doing down in Paraguay...

13:31.478 --> 13:34.081
They weren't going fishing.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.160
You know, I can't imagine
ever living out of a motorhome.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.161
Ugh, really?

13:48.195 --> 13:50.563
I have always wanted to.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.333
I could get rid of my car,
I'd get rid of my apartment.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.203
Technically, you'd still own
a car and an apartment.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.905
Huh.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.240
Way to just kill
a lifelong ambition.

14:00.273 --> 14:01.241
GIBBS:
Okay.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.175
What do we got?

14:02.209 --> 14:04.044
Oh, what we've got is

14:04.077 --> 14:07.114
prep for a fishing trip if
you're gonna go after Moby Dick.

14:07.147 --> 14:10.450
Or else, Dean and Hudson
were preparing for war.

14:10.483 --> 14:13.086
Yeah, we don't know
where they got this stuff yet,

14:13.120 --> 14:15.122
but we were able
to work backwards

14:15.155 --> 14:17.557
through the packing material
to identify

14:17.590 --> 14:20.160
sniper rifle scopes,
smoke grenades.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.628
We got remote detonators,
tear gas.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.396
BISHOP:
And enough ammo to

14:23.430 --> 14:25.565
do something really bad.

14:25.598 --> 14:28.401
ABBY: I mean, how did they get
this stuff down to Paraguay?

14:28.435 --> 14:31.104
I can't even get my dog collar
through security.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.173
They left a lot behind.
Mm-hmm.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.541
Good eye, and they
didn't just leave

14:34.574 --> 14:36.243
odds and ends behind.

14:36.276 --> 14:37.945
There's boxes
for four backpacks.

14:37.978 --> 14:42.149
But... two were left behind.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.218
And there's boxes for
four night-vision goggles.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.386
Two were left behind.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.021
Yeah, got it.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.223
Prepped for four,
only two geared up.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.225
So who didn't
go? And we know

14:52.259 --> 14:55.028
Commander Josephson
is in Mosul.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.164
So we have a missing fourth.

14:57.197 --> 15:00.200
And we have a lead
on who that might be.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.269
Found this picture
in the motorhome.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.937
And I've got a funny feeling

15:03.971 --> 15:05.538
that fourth guy
is our fourth guy.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.240
You run facial
recognition?

15:07.274 --> 15:08.341
Yeah.

15:08.375 --> 15:12.479
Petty Officer
Christopher Clayton.

15:12.512 --> 15:17.050
So if he is our fourth guy,
why didn't he go on the trip?

15:17.084 --> 15:20.087
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

15:20.120 --> 15:21.721
Well, that answers
that question.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.356
Oh, thank God. I've been
pushing the call button

15:23.390 --> 15:24.357
for five minutes.

15:24.391 --> 15:28.161
Uh, no. Not nurses, uh...

15:28.195 --> 15:29.596
Special Agents Bishop and Quinn.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.098
NCIS.
I don't care who you are.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.200
I got an itch on my foot,
you got to get it.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.035
Uh-huh.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.336
Right, well, um,

15:36.369 --> 15:38.271
that's all you,
'cause I don't do feet.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.540
(sighs)
Fine.

15:40.573 --> 15:43.243
Only because
we need information.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.211
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.981
(moaning):
Oh, yeah.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.416
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.218
That's so good.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.219
Harder.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.320
Ah, a little harder.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.655
Little harder.
Okay. Done here.

15:55.688 --> 15:58.225
That's fine.
Ask me anything you want.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.592
You're my hero.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.428
All right, well, I go first.

16:01.461 --> 16:05.232
When was the last time you spoke
to Petty Officer Matthew Dean?

16:05.265 --> 16:07.300
Couple weeks ago. Why?

16:07.334 --> 16:08.368
What'd you talk about?

16:08.401 --> 16:09.602
Said he and Hudson

16:09.636 --> 16:11.004
had something big coming up.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.372
Asked if I was free.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.374
I said yes,
then suddenly wasn't.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.043
Take a guess why.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.011
What happened?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.346
My six-year-old's
birthday party.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.513
Let's just say I'm much better

16:20.547 --> 16:22.149
at kicking ass
than roller-skating,

16:22.182 --> 16:23.350
and leave it at that.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.451
So, did Petty Officer Dean

16:24.484 --> 16:26.319
tell you what
"something big" was?

16:26.353 --> 16:28.288
No.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.323
What's this all about?

16:30.357 --> 16:32.525
Well, he told his wife
he was going fishing in Canada,

16:32.559 --> 16:34.361
and that was a lie.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.696
Really?

16:36.729 --> 16:39.032
How strange.

16:39.066 --> 16:42.802
FYI, withholding information

16:42.835 --> 16:46.206
from federal investigators
is a crime.

16:46.239 --> 16:49.109
(sighs)

16:49.142 --> 16:52.079
"Going fishing"
was Dean and Hudson's code

16:52.112 --> 16:53.280
for going to Vegas.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.249
Oh. And how often
did they do that?

16:56.283 --> 16:58.085
Too much.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.587
They were good guys,
but had a gambling problem.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.290
Both of them owed
a lot of people a lot of money.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.825
Except this time,
your friends didn't go to Vegas.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.827
They went to Paraguay.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.263
Don't know anything about that.

17:10.297 --> 17:14.367
Except for the fact that your
last mission was in Paraguay.

17:14.401 --> 17:16.103
No comment.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.637
That's something
I can't talk about.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.573
Okay, well, Petty Officer Dean

17:20.607 --> 17:23.410
was killed
in the jungles of Paraguay,

17:23.443 --> 17:25.612
and Petty Officer Hudson
is missing.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.114
What?

17:27.147 --> 17:28.348
What happened?

17:28.381 --> 17:30.217
That's what we're trying
to find out.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.285
So if you want
to help your friend,

17:32.319 --> 17:35.322
you'll let us know what you were
doing in Paraguay last time.

17:38.391 --> 17:42.529
Commander Josephson's SEAL team
was sent down to Paraguay

17:42.562 --> 17:44.831
on a recon mission
to gather intelligence

17:44.864 --> 17:46.533
on a rebel group called

17:46.566 --> 17:48.868
the Revolutionary Armed Council.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.304
My international contacts
are telling me R.A.C.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.872
isn't actually rebelling
against anything.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.874
They're just thugs,
plain and simple.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.476
They move in a lawless area

17:56.509 --> 17:57.777
of the country,
kidnapping children,

17:57.810 --> 18:00.547
turning them into soldiers
to steal with them.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.748
What are they stealing?

18:01.781 --> 18:03.383
VANCE:
Uranium.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.684
Paraguay's recently
been investing heavily

18:04.717 --> 18:06.419
in uranium mining.

18:06.453 --> 18:09.156
R.A.C. has made it their mission
to steal as much as they can

18:09.189 --> 18:10.523
so they can sell it
on the black market.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.325
That's everything the D.O.D.
has on them.

18:12.359 --> 18:13.293
It's not a lot.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.695
Hence the recon mission.
VANCE: I'm guessing

18:15.728 --> 18:17.430
the Pentagon thought
if they followed the money,

18:17.464 --> 18:19.566
they could find out
who was buying the uranium.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.235
But Clayton said the
mission went sideways.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.471
When his team was discovered,
they only survived

18:24.504 --> 18:26.706
because a local villager
helped them escape.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.575
REEVES: Not a place I'd be
eager to go back to, either.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.744
Unless, they were
heavily in debt.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.814
And R.A.C. had "barrels of
cash just lying around,"

18:34.847 --> 18:37.417
which is an exact quote
from Petty Officer Clayton.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.486
McGEE: You know,
what if Dean and Hudson

18:39.519 --> 18:40.587
went back for the money grab?

18:40.620 --> 18:43.423
VANCE: And things
went south again.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.724
Do we know if these guys
were anywhere

18:44.757 --> 18:46.426
near where Dean's body
was found?

18:46.459 --> 18:47.827
No, but Torres and Quinn

18:47.860 --> 18:49.529
have been checking
military satellite footage,

18:49.562 --> 18:51.498
but nothing's tasked
to the area.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.799
I've got an idea.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.367
You remember
Abby's friend, Carol?

18:54.401 --> 18:55.635
Now, she has a friend
who knows...

18:55.668 --> 18:57.204
McGee, come on.
Get to the point.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.238
All right.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.506
We may have a contact at NOAA.

18:59.539 --> 19:00.907
They've got weather satellites

19:00.940 --> 19:02.809
covering the entire planet;
resolution isn't as good

19:02.842 --> 19:04.377
as the military satellites,

19:04.411 --> 19:06.379
but we should be able
to pick something up.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.681
If not R.A.C.,
Petty Officer Hudson.

19:08.715 --> 19:09.682
Still missing.

19:09.716 --> 19:10.650
Yeah, go.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.385
Take Abby. Go.

19:14.421 --> 19:15.688
CURTIS:
NCIS.

19:15.722 --> 19:17.357
Again.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.558
Hey, McGee.

19:18.591 --> 19:22.229
Hello, hello... hello.

19:22.262 --> 19:23.763
And you must be Carol's friend.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.365
Curtis Hubley.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.301
But you can call me
anything you want.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.538
How does
"totally inappropriate" sound?

19:31.571 --> 19:33.706
Spicy.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.475
Curtis, we don't have
a lot of time.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.710
Right. Captain Carol
gave me the skinny.

19:37.744 --> 19:40.213
(imitating William Shatner):
"Full power, Scotty."

19:40.247 --> 19:42.415
Our older satellites don't have
quite the resolution you need,

19:42.449 --> 19:45.685
but our new GOES-16
has ten times the imaging power.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.454
Do you like Mexican food?

19:47.487 --> 19:48.955
I'm not going
to dinner with you.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.290
How do you feel about brunch?

19:50.323 --> 19:51.591
Now you're just being rude.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.426
Curtis.
Sorry.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.595
This is the area where you said
your SEAL was found.

19:55.628 --> 19:56.796
I programmed a macro to flag

19:56.829 --> 19:58.565
any movement
in the surrounding forest.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.967
There was definitely
activity yesterday

20:01.000 --> 20:02.235
in that area.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.403
What are those?

20:03.436 --> 20:04.404
Good question.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.340
I'm happy to explain that to you
over some tapas.

20:07.374 --> 20:11.478
I'm a very nonviolent person,
but I will slap you.

20:11.511 --> 20:13.313
Is it that easy?

20:13.346 --> 20:14.614
Ouchy.

20:14.647 --> 20:15.582
That signal appears
to be a group

20:15.615 --> 20:17.584
of about ten armed guerillas.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.586
R.A.C.
Heading away from

20:19.619 --> 20:20.653
a town called Val Verde.

20:20.687 --> 20:21.954
Definitely in the same area.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.557
That is not a coincidence.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.792
Yeah. Where were they going?

20:25.825 --> 20:27.660
Looks like
some kind of compound.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.529
Bunch of them
went into one of the huts.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.797
Didn't come out
until the next morning.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.399
Maybe that's where they sleep.

20:33.633 --> 20:34.901
What is that?

20:34.934 --> 20:36.603
CURTIS:
Another body.

20:36.636 --> 20:37.670
Someone was watching the huts.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.572
Looks like all night.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.508
You thinking what I'm thinking?

20:41.541 --> 20:44.744
That could be Hudson,
our missing petty officer.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.946
How do, gents?

20:46.979 --> 20:49.816
Abby asked me to keep an eye
on her blood-thingy machine.

20:49.849 --> 20:53.386
Said if it spits anything out,
I should get it to you.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.355
Oh, much appreciated, Clayton.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.623
Anything to report?

20:56.656 --> 20:57.757
JIMMY:
Yes.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.493
Dr. Mallard is quite
the Scorsese fan.

21:00.527 --> 21:01.828
Who knew?

21:01.861 --> 21:03.596
I meant about the body.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.398
Well, I can verify
that a machete

21:05.432 --> 21:08.835
was used to dismember
most of this lad.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.437
Most?

21:10.470 --> 21:13.706
Yes, the hand was removed
by some other bladed weapon.

21:13.740 --> 21:15.942
Maybe there was two attackers.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.444
Perhaps.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.546
Of course,

21:19.579 --> 21:21.948
the other possibility
that comes to mind is...

21:21.981 --> 21:23.583
Doctor?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.518
I need to see Gibbs.

21:28.521 --> 21:30.957
McGEE: It appears to be some
kind of sleeping quarters,

21:30.990 --> 21:33.593
housing maybe a dozen
or so R.A.C. guerillas.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.762
And we think we found
Petty Officer Hudson.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.764
What is he doing out there?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.966
Well, remember those
barrels of cash the R.A.C. has?

21:39.999 --> 21:42.602
Hudson's SEAL-mate says that
they hide them in their huts.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.970
ABBY: We think
Hudson's just waiting

21:44.003 --> 21:46.806
for the right time
to go for the gold.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.007
I can relate.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.876
Zip it, creepy guy.
Okay.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.911
Curtis, I need a closer look.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.516
McGEE: Now, the weapon's
the right size for a Colt M4A1.

21:56.549 --> 22:00.019
We also found leftover rounds
from a Colt in Hudson's trailer.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.721
So, it's got to be him.

22:01.754 --> 22:02.622
So, what's the
plan, boss?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.891
Track him, long as you can.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.427
Pick him up
when he tries to move.

22:07.460 --> 22:08.628
Whoa!

22:08.661 --> 22:09.929
Stop it right there.
Freeze it.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.998
All right, back it up.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.866
Stop. Right there.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.868
Loop it.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.738
Wait, is he
missing his...

22:18.771 --> 22:20.407
Jethro, I have news.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.741
Ah.

22:21.774 --> 22:24.744
Abby, the, uh, DNA
that you were running

22:24.777 --> 22:27.380
on Petty Officer Dean
has finished processing.

22:27.414 --> 22:30.617
So, did my babies prove that
it is in fact his hand?

22:30.650 --> 22:32.585
Yes, but you got
a different result

22:32.619 --> 22:34.020
from the other body parts.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.424
Who?

22:37.457 --> 22:39.025
They belong to
Petty Officer Hudson.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.661
Hudson isn't missing.
He's down in autopsy.

22:41.694 --> 22:45.565
And since the only body part
Dean appears to be missing

22:45.598 --> 22:49.035
is his hand, it's entirely
possible he's still alive.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.739
Doc? You think?

22:55.642 --> 22:57.610
REEVES: Who wants
to tell the bloke

22:57.644 --> 22:59.579
we found his missing hand?

23:11.958 --> 23:13.726
Uh, something's up.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.927
GIBBS:
Bishop, coordinate

23:14.961 --> 23:16.863
with Special Agent Taggart
in Paraguay.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.466
Country and weapons clearance,
you, me and McGee.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.867
Wait, what's going on?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.602
Petty Officer Dean is alive,

23:22.635 --> 23:23.936
minus his right hand.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.572
Uh, what about Hudson?

23:25.605 --> 23:26.405
Dead.

23:26.439 --> 23:28.641
Those are his body parts
in autopsy.

23:28.675 --> 23:29.609
Did you find out what
they were doing in Paraguay?

23:29.642 --> 23:31.611
You ever ever see the movie
Three Kings?

23:31.644 --> 23:32.645
We're guessing
they went back

23:32.679 --> 23:34.146
for R.A.C.'s money.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.449
When do we leave?

23:36.483 --> 23:37.750
First available flight.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.619
Take care of
travel arrangements.

23:39.652 --> 23:43.122
Uh, hey, Gibbs?
Why is she going instead of me?

23:43.155 --> 23:44.691
Uh, why not?

23:44.724 --> 23:47.026
(speaks Spanish)

23:47.059 --> 23:48.695
(speaks Spanish)

23:48.728 --> 23:49.729
TORRES:
Okay.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.030
(speaks Spanish)

23:51.063 --> 23:52.699
But I spent half of
my life down there,

23:52.732 --> 23:55.167
and... I blend in.

23:56.769 --> 23:57.904
That's a good point.

23:57.937 --> 23:58.905
All right, got it.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.674
Bishop, stay here.
Provide support for Quinn.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.710
Petty Officer Dean's wife,
first thing in the morning,

24:03.743 --> 24:05.545
you catch her up.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.883
We didn't discuss
how you're gonna handle this.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.720
How I'm gonna handle this?
No, he said both of us.

24:13.753 --> 24:16.088
Bringing her good news
this time.

24:16.122 --> 24:18.024
(groans)
It's so awkward.

24:18.057 --> 24:19.992
We left her thinking
her husband's dead.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.061
She's probably
in mourning,
(doorbell rings)

24:22.094 --> 24:23.563
making funeral
arrangements.

24:23.596 --> 24:24.764
Just tell the truth.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.199
That we jumped to conclusions?

24:27.233 --> 24:29.068
We only had her husband's hand

24:29.101 --> 24:31.771
and were misled
by the other body parts? Mm.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.239
No, that's the bad news.

24:33.272 --> 24:35.107
Now, we tell her
the surveillance evidence

24:35.141 --> 24:37.810
indicates that her husband
is alive.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.946
Yay. She should be thrilled.
(phone ringing)

24:39.979 --> 24:43.149
Oh, I got to take this.
It's Mom.
Okay.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.717
QUINN:
Yeah?

24:49.656 --> 24:52.725
Agent Bishop.
What is it now?

24:55.662 --> 24:58.598
(birds chirping)

25:00.833 --> 25:02.835
(dogs barking in distance)

25:14.080 --> 25:15.782
McGEE: (sighs) Those last
ten miles were torture.

25:15.815 --> 25:16.849
Think I threw out my back.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.719
Yeah, you should have sat
in the rear seat, man.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.320
My butt is numb.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.555
Split up.

25:22.589 --> 25:23.856
All right.

25:23.890 --> 25:26.225
You know what?
I have got to pee, and I do not

25:26.258 --> 25:27.994
see a gas station
anywhere around here.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.129
Why didn't you go when
we stopped on the road?

25:30.162 --> 25:31.030
Well, because I didn't
need to go then.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.532
You got to plan ahead, bud.

25:34.734 --> 25:35.868
The cantina.

25:35.902 --> 25:38.671
I'm gonna try
the cantina.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.006
I hope you make it.

25:43.676 --> 25:45.845
Quinn, did they land yet?

25:45.878 --> 25:46.913
Have you heard anything?

25:46.946 --> 25:48.748
Well, I spoke to McGee
hours ago,

25:48.781 --> 25:51.784
and he said they were
on their way to Val Verde.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.219
(sighs)
It's so frustrating.

25:53.252 --> 25:54.721
I have been over

25:54.754 --> 25:56.823
and over Petty Officer
Hudson's mobile home

25:56.856 --> 25:58.925
trying to find any clue

25:58.958 --> 26:00.693
as to how
they might have

26:00.727 --> 26:01.894
gotten their equipment
past customs,

26:01.928 --> 26:03.763
but I didn't find anything.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.331
Well, we may have a lead.

26:05.364 --> 26:07.634
I've been going through both
petty officers' phone records.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.168
Right before they left,

26:09.201 --> 26:11.103
Dean was in contact with this

26:11.137 --> 26:13.973
international relief
organization that ships food,

26:14.006 --> 26:16.776
clothing, medical supplies
all around the world.

26:16.809 --> 26:18.778
I don't think they would ship
military equipment.

26:18.811 --> 26:19.979
Agreed,

26:20.012 --> 26:22.849
but the charity has regional
branches all over the world,

26:22.882 --> 26:24.350
one being Paraguay.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.754
Sounds like
too much of a coincidence.

26:27.787 --> 26:28.788
(hangs up phone)

26:28.821 --> 26:29.989
Do you have something?

26:30.022 --> 26:31.858
Well, I talked to someone...

26:33.760 --> 26:35.327
...who admitted
he spoke to Dean.

26:35.361 --> 26:38.097
But when I pressed him,
he got squirrelly and hung up.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.032
I think I should
pay him a visit.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.138
(dogs barking, goats bleating
in distance)

26:49.809 --> 26:52.078
(speaking Spanish)

27:03.155 --> 27:04.657
No.

27:26.012 --> 27:28.447
(clicks tongue,
speaks Spanish)

27:28.480 --> 27:30.149
(speaking Spanish)

27:30.182 --> 27:31.951
(clicking tongue)

27:33.419 --> 27:35.421
Buenas tardes, señorita.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.028
Would you rather speak
in English?

27:42.061 --> 27:45.865
Well, sí. Yeah, sure.

27:45.898 --> 27:47.700
How'd you know I do?

27:47.734 --> 27:51.203
I saw the men you
came into town with.

27:51.237 --> 27:54.073
Ah.

27:54.106 --> 27:55.708
You speak the language well.

27:55.742 --> 27:56.909
(chuckles softly)

27:56.943 --> 27:58.845
Thank you.

27:58.878 --> 28:01.280
I study it in the city.

28:02.915 --> 28:06.786
We do not see many strangers
in this town anymore.

28:06.819 --> 28:08.320
Why are you here?

28:08.354 --> 28:09.956
We're looking for a man.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.060
Have you seen
this guy?

28:18.297 --> 28:20.066
What about this guy?

28:21.801 --> 28:23.736
No.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.004
All right.

28:26.272 --> 28:29.776
Does this have something to do
with the rebels?

28:29.809 --> 28:31.277
The R.A.C.?

28:33.279 --> 28:35.081
Maybe.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.916
Have they been through here?

28:36.949 --> 28:41.988
They took my brother, Ramón.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.793
McGEE:
Well, boss,

28:46.826 --> 28:48.060
couldn't get anyone to talk.

28:48.094 --> 28:49.161
They're afraid of something.

28:49.195 --> 28:51.831
Yeah. Gathered that.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.199
Ten kilometers, on foot,

28:53.232 --> 28:56.335
to the coordinates where
the satellite spotted Dean.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.040
It'll be dark
before we get there.

29:01.073 --> 29:04.076
Got to find
some place to stay.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.012
BURKE: Okay, let's pack 'em
and stack 'em, boys and girls.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.814
No time for chitchat.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.148
BISHOP:
Well, make time.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.050
NCIS.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.886
Same NCIS you hung up
on earlier.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.188
Sorry, got nothing
more to say.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.925
You said you spoke to
Petty Officer Dean.

29:18.958 --> 29:20.026
Mm-hmm.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.128
Not sure what
your relationship with him

29:22.161 --> 29:25.031
is exactly,
but, uh, can't imagine

29:25.064 --> 29:26.565
he's worth
going to prison for.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.869
Prison? For shipping a box?

29:29.902 --> 29:31.403
And what was in this box?

29:31.437 --> 29:32.371
I have no clue.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.540
It was sealed shut when
they dropped it off.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.108
Who's they?

29:36.142 --> 29:38.210
Hudson and Dean.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.479
Asked me for a favor,
so I said sure,

29:40.512 --> 29:42.048
added their package
to our haul.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.550
You expect us to believe
you're stupid enough

29:44.583 --> 29:47.119
to send some mystery box
to Paraguay?

29:47.153 --> 29:49.555
Yeah. Three of us go way back.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.858
You guys serve together?

29:51.891 --> 29:54.393
No, I never actually made it
through basic.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.395
We met down at The Anchor Bar.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.865
A lot of SEAL teams
hang out there.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.599
And you'd do pretty much
anything they asked,

30:00.632 --> 30:02.034
right, mate?

30:02.068 --> 30:03.535
(scoffs)
Anything within reason.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.071
They're American heroes.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.010
Aren't they?

30:12.078 --> 30:13.079
McGEE:
Hey, find anything?

30:13.112 --> 30:14.914
Yeah. Found a casita.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.015
Only one room, though.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.216
Hope you don't snore, McGee.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.051
I don't.
Yeah, I got it.

30:19.085 --> 30:20.052
Who's he talking to?

30:20.086 --> 30:21.087
Bishop.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.595
You ready for
that, Timmy? Hmm?

30:29.628 --> 30:30.596
(softly):
Yeah.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.100
Oh. What'd Bishop say?

30:34.133 --> 30:36.502
We should go to church.

30:38.604 --> 30:41.874
Oh, my mom would be
so happy right now.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.983
(door opens)

30:51.017 --> 30:53.052
(bell tolling in distance)

30:55.054 --> 30:56.855
(door closes)

31:03.029 --> 31:04.663
Uh, well...

31:04.696 --> 31:06.398
(speaks Spanish)
You're up.

31:08.434 --> 31:09.902
Señora...

31:24.250 --> 31:27.453
I think I'm the one
you need to speak to.

31:30.689 --> 31:34.360
This man-- we think
he's around here and hurt.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.562
Have you seen him?

31:42.201 --> 31:44.236
GIBBS:
Petty Officer Dean?

31:44.270 --> 31:46.973
NCIS.

32:01.687 --> 32:04.190
Hudson and I didn't come down
to Paraguay to steal money.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.625
RICARDO:
They were here to

32:06.658 --> 32:08.294
rescue my son Enrique.

32:12.364 --> 32:14.967
Last year, we were part
of a four-man SEAL team

32:15.001 --> 32:17.036
gathering intelligence
on the R.A.C.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.670
The mission went south.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.573
We would have all been killed
if it wasn't for Ricardo.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.976
He helped us escape
and hid us here.

32:24.010 --> 32:26.578
RICARDO:
Three weeks ago,

32:26.612 --> 32:30.482
rebels raided our village
and took Enrique

32:30.516 --> 32:32.151
and two other boys

32:32.184 --> 32:34.320
to be child soldiers.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.522
In three months,
they'll be brainwashed guerillas

32:36.555 --> 32:37.689
who'd kill their own family.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.992
I didn't know what to do.

32:40.026 --> 32:43.362
DEAN: He called me.
We owed Ricardo big-time.

32:43.395 --> 32:47.099
You and Hudson came down here
alone, off the books?

32:48.734 --> 32:51.003
Did you have a plan?

32:51.037 --> 32:53.439
Obviously not a good one.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.544
We were ambushed
surveying the compound.

32:58.577 --> 33:02.081
Hudson was killed,
and, well,

33:02.114 --> 33:03.515
most of me escaped.

33:03.549 --> 33:04.783
Had to hurt.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.586
I don't think about it.

33:12.424 --> 33:13.425
The truck is hidden.

33:15.127 --> 33:17.563
Yeah, good.

33:19.431 --> 33:20.732
All right, we
rest up tonight.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.102
We take shifts
on guard.

33:23.135 --> 33:25.037
We leave at dawn.

33:25.071 --> 33:26.638
Get you some medical attention.

33:26.672 --> 33:29.708
I'm fine. Docs aren't gonna
grow me a new hand.

33:29.741 --> 33:32.578
Damn. And I thought I was tough.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.816
The R.A.C.'s not gonna
stop looking for you, Dean.

33:37.849 --> 33:41.087
I appreciate your concern,
but this isn't over.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.655
It should have never started.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.292
You got a wife at home.

33:46.325 --> 33:49.628
From what I hear, she
still seems to love you.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.300
Ricardo's got a son
who loves him.

33:54.333 --> 33:57.469
I'm not leaving
without the kid.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.308
TAGGART: I've coordinated with
the Paraguayan military.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.676
They know we have
three agents in country.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.612
What else do they know?

34:06.645 --> 34:08.547
Not much.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.683
Okay, Fleet Forces has an LPD
with helicopter support

34:11.717 --> 34:14.853
off the coast of Brazil
within range of the target.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.656
We're just waiting for the exact
location of the landing zone.

34:17.689 --> 34:20.459
Royal Navy is standing by
for backup, if needed.

34:20.492 --> 34:22.561
Copy that.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.196
Director Vance.

34:24.230 --> 34:26.565
Been a long time.

34:26.598 --> 34:29.168
Someone gonna tell me what
the hell is going on in here?

34:29.201 --> 34:31.337
We are organizing
support for Gibbs.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.272
Support for what?

34:33.305 --> 34:34.706
GIBBS (over speaker):
A rescue mission.

34:34.740 --> 34:36.575
Gibbs?

34:36.608 --> 34:39.678
He's on satellite phone.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.613
Petty Officer Dean is alive?

34:41.647 --> 34:43.215
Yeah.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.884
He and Hudson came down here
alone to rescue a child

34:45.917 --> 34:48.620
who was kidnapped
by rebel terrorists.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.156
And?

34:50.189 --> 34:52.591
And we're planning to help him

34:52.624 --> 34:54.626
before pulling out
tomorrow morning.

34:54.660 --> 34:58.230
His dad saved the lives
of four Navy SEALS last year.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.699
Gibbs, I can't sanction
a covert operation

35:00.732 --> 35:02.568
in a foreign country
by my agents.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.471
Not asking you to, Leon.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.274
What exactly are you asking for?

35:08.307 --> 35:10.242
Navy helicopter.

35:10.276 --> 35:13.512
Emergency extraction
of United States citizens.

35:14.646 --> 35:17.283
It's all lined up.
Just needs your approval.

35:18.850 --> 35:22.654
All your actions
must be defensive, Gibbs.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.991
Understood.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.830
DEAN: Now, the hut
where they bunk Enrique

35:31.863 --> 35:33.665
and the other
kids is here.

35:33.699 --> 35:37.536
About one klick south is a
clearing for the helicopter.

35:37.569 --> 35:41.240
I've snuck out the past few
days to reconnoiter the place.

35:41.273 --> 35:43.675
That's where we picked you up
on satellite.

35:43.709 --> 35:46.678
The optimum time
to strike is 0630.

35:46.712 --> 35:49.548
Night guards are
tired, half asleep.

35:49.581 --> 35:51.917
Regulars don't show up
until 30 minutes later.

35:51.950 --> 35:56.722
We've got preset remote-control
charges and enough weapons,

35:56.755 --> 35:58.357
but we are heavily
outnumbered.

35:58.390 --> 35:59.891
And the helicopter will be

35:59.925 --> 36:02.528
at the extreme limit
of its range.

36:02.561 --> 36:05.531
It will only be able
to stay on the ground

36:05.564 --> 36:07.266
three minutes.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.868
Hmm.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.738
You were gonna do this
all by yourself, Rambo?

36:12.771 --> 36:14.940
No helo, just one hand?

36:14.973 --> 36:16.575
(door opens)

36:16.608 --> 36:20.246
All right,
it's my turn to stand watch.

36:20.279 --> 36:21.747
McGEE:
It's dark out there, quiet.

36:21.780 --> 36:22.881
No one's on the street.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.683
TORRES:
Copy.

36:25.951 --> 36:28.454
Call your wife.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.622
You got a lot
of explaining to do.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.694
She's tough.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.663
Only person I'm afraid of.

36:40.366 --> 36:43.369
Well, speaking of wives,
I finally talked to Delilah.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.603
How is she?

36:44.636 --> 36:46.772
Not bad.
She's over the morning sickness.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.840
Had her first good day
in a couple weeks.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.644
You know, Tim,
there's no obligation here.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.413
Strictly voluntary.

36:54.446 --> 36:55.847
Good.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.319
Well, you got
new responsibilities.

37:00.352 --> 37:02.721
Boss, I appreciate that,

37:02.754 --> 37:06.725
but don't forget
I'm an NCIS special agent.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.767
(birds chirping)

37:15.801 --> 37:18.236
(rooster crowing in distance,
chickens clucking)

37:58.577 --> 37:59.711
(man speaks Spanish)

38:17.062 --> 38:18.497
Bishop, where's that helo?

38:18.530 --> 38:20.332
Five kilometers east
and holding.

38:20.366 --> 38:21.833
Waiting.
Fuel's critical.

38:21.867 --> 38:23.735
All right, boss,
it's ready and waiting.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.738
Torres...
are you set?

38:26.772 --> 38:29.375
Hold on, hold on.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.879
Gibbs, the regulars are coming.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.681
They're early.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.654
We're blowing the trucks.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.561
Bring in the helo now.

38:49.595 --> 38:50.896
(men shouting in Spanish)

38:55.834 --> 38:58.003
Dean!
Enrique.
Your father's waiting.

39:09.848 --> 39:10.849
(men shouting in Spanish)

39:36.942 --> 39:38.877
(gunfire continues)

39:44.583 --> 39:46.518
Go! I got this!

39:54.025 --> 39:55.193
I got you. Come on.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.562
Come on!

40:05.737 --> 40:06.738
Enrique!

40:06.772 --> 40:08.640
ENRIQUE:
Papa!

40:08.674 --> 40:09.975
(Ricardo shouting in Spanish)

40:13.512 --> 40:15.647
All right, come on.

40:15.681 --> 40:16.848
Come on! (speaks Spanish)

40:20.952 --> 40:22.554
Come on.
(speaks Spanish)

40:27.526 --> 40:28.894
Get out of here!

40:28.927 --> 40:30.796
All right, take off!

40:32.964 --> 40:34.766
If the copter blows,
everyone dies.

40:37.869 --> 40:38.937
Nick, you got 'em.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.138
Tim, what are you doing?!

40:40.171 --> 40:41.473
Tim!

40:41.507 --> 40:42.508
(indistinct
military radio chatter)

40:45.911 --> 40:48.780
