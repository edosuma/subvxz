WEBVTT

00:10.314 --> 00:12.360
You once told me you could
get me on a plane to America.

00:12.490 --> 00:14.405
Times have changed.
Everyone and his dog wants out.

00:14.536 --> 00:15.711
-How much?
-Five grand a head.

00:15.841 --> 00:18.105
Fuck.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.454
We need to swallow our pride
and do one last job with Gully.

00:19.584 --> 00:20.455
Gully's dangerous.

00:20.585 --> 00:21.717
Mad as a hatter.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.153
Who dares wins, eh?

00:25.677 --> 00:28.376
[people shouting, screaming]

00:28.506 --> 00:30.247
Tell me it wasn't you who
robbed the wrestling and killed

00:30.378 --> 00:31.248
-those people.
-Aah!

00:31.379 --> 00:32.554
[Alfred]
No, don't! Stop!

00:32.684 --> 00:34.730
Things went wrong.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.645
-Get out.
-This tragedy

00:36.775 --> 00:37.950
is all the more reason
we have to get to America.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.692
For the millionth time,
I am not going to America.

00:40.823 --> 00:43.782
Least of all
with a murderous robber!

00:43.913 --> 00:46.394
Our next candidate for prime
minister is Mr. John Ripper.

00:46.524 --> 00:47.830
RIPPER: If you elect me
leader of the League,

00:47.960 --> 00:50.615
we'll put the boots in
hard and heavy!

00:50.746 --> 00:52.139
I would like to dismiss
Mr. Ripper's plan

00:52.269 --> 00:53.705
on moral grounds.

00:53.836 --> 00:55.707
Love, compassion--
the liberal virtues

00:55.838 --> 00:57.883
are our greatest weapons,

00:58.014 --> 01:00.408
and we shall win out in the end,

01:00.538 --> 01:02.323
because humanity is with us!

01:04.151 --> 01:06.066
GAUNT:
I bring news from London.

01:06.196 --> 01:08.024
The League have elected
a new prime minister.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.592
Perhaps this Aziz chap
will be someone

01:10.722 --> 01:12.724
we can do business with.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.987
Do you speak for Harwood
and the Union or for yourself?

01:15.118 --> 01:16.467
I speak for the good
of the English people.

01:16.598 --> 01:18.861
How can I refuse such virtue?

01:18.991 --> 01:20.863
SALT: Mrs. Gaunt held
a face-to-face meeting

01:20.993 --> 01:23.387
with Prime Minister
Aziz yesterday.

01:23.518 --> 01:24.693
I went to speak to him
on your behalf.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.695
You broke my heart, Frances.

01:26.825 --> 01:27.783
You broke my fucking heart.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.654
I was trying to help you!

01:29.785 --> 01:32.483
Yes, of course, Frances,
you're right, I'm crazy.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.398
LUCIUS:
Ancillary technical staff,

01:34.529 --> 01:35.573
Dr. Lucius Fox.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.488
[people gasp]

01:43.320 --> 01:45.322
[grunting]

01:45.453 --> 01:47.890
I'm not sure if you're brave
or stupid.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.674
Both.

01:49.805 --> 01:51.633
-Why are you here?
-Why do you think?

01:51.763 --> 01:53.243
He hurt you,
so you want to hurt him.

01:53.374 --> 01:54.592
Would you like me to leave?

01:54.723 --> 01:56.116
[Alfred]
No.

01:58.727 --> 02:01.643
â™ª

02:10.782 --> 02:12.871
God, I hate polyester sheets.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.525
They make everything sordid.

02:16.919 --> 02:18.834
Light me one.

02:27.451 --> 02:28.844
Friday.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.675
I guess this is
hello and goodbye, then.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.943
Probably, yeah.

02:41.073 --> 02:42.727
Mm.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.425
Next couple of days
will be well busy.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.690
It's been fun.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.564
Brief.

02:53.695 --> 02:55.697
But fun.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.438
Yeah.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.484
Fun.

03:07.535 --> 03:08.840
Wish things were different.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.628
Do you?

03:14.890 --> 03:17.588
I just said I did.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.466
Do you like me, Alfie?

03:25.596 --> 03:27.337
Well, I think I just
showed you I did.

03:27.468 --> 03:28.860
[giggles]

03:30.688 --> 03:34.083
No, I mean as a person.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.606
-As a person?
-[chuckles]

03:35.737 --> 03:36.781
I hardly know you, madam.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.482
Why do you like me, then?

03:44.702 --> 03:46.922
You don't love me.

03:47.052 --> 03:49.751
You don't have stupid dreams

03:49.881 --> 03:52.449
about the happy life that
we're gonna have together.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.669
Hmm.

03:54.799 --> 03:56.758
The perfect woman.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.238
Yeah, you might be.

03:59.891 --> 04:01.850
How do you know...

04:01.980 --> 04:03.808
that I don't love you?

04:05.897 --> 04:08.073
Get out.

04:08.204 --> 04:09.901
You don't, do you?

04:11.468 --> 04:12.687
[chuckles softly]

04:14.819 --> 04:16.995
I wish I did.
[short chuckle]

04:17.126 --> 04:19.694
I'd like to be in love
with somebody.

04:19.824 --> 04:22.566
People in love
have a purpose in life.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.046
But I'm not in love
and I've got a purpose.

04:24.176 --> 04:25.874
What, America, you mean?

04:26.004 --> 04:27.441
What's wrong with America?

04:28.659 --> 04:30.487
Nothing.

04:30.618 --> 04:33.142
I'd go myself if I could.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.100
That's not a purpose, it's...

04:35.231 --> 04:37.102
it's just a destination.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.104
You could go.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.411
If you wanted.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.849
How?

04:47.461 --> 04:49.376
Well...

04:49.506 --> 04:51.421
I don't know.

04:51.552 --> 04:53.684
Anything's possible.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.686
[chuckles]

04:55.817 --> 04:56.992
Relax.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.994
I'm not asking you.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.824
I'm not asking you
for anything.

05:04.216 --> 05:06.306
Good.

05:08.003 --> 05:10.310
'Cause I'd find it hard
to say no.

05:22.539 --> 05:23.975
Thirteen...

05:24.106 --> 05:25.977
fourteen...

05:26.108 --> 05:27.805
15,000.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.590
That was fast.

05:30.765 --> 05:31.896
You rob a bank?

05:32.027 --> 05:33.637
That's three seats on your plane

05:33.768 --> 05:35.944
plus the paperwork and bribes,
as agreed. Right?

05:36.074 --> 05:37.859
Absolutely.
It's all there.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.079
I'm impressed.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.037
Didn't think
you could pull together

05:42.167 --> 05:43.168
that amount of cash so fast.

05:43.299 --> 05:44.648
Do you want to count it?

05:46.171 --> 05:48.391
I figured you'd be short.

05:48.522 --> 05:51.263
And I knew you wouldn't
take a loan, so, actually,

05:51.394 --> 05:53.788
I had a quick job
lined up for you.

05:53.918 --> 05:56.573
Payment in kind
kind of deal.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.183
Help if you needed it.

05:58.314 --> 06:00.795
But... never mind.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.579
Not needed.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.407
That's very considerate of you.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.366
Anyhow, the job's still there
if you're interested.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.587
It would fit your schedule

06:10.718 --> 06:11.849
and it's good money.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.155
[soft chuckle]

06:13.285 --> 06:14.896
I'm afraid
you're wasting your time.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.724
I'm not ever coming
to work for you.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.769
Not you or anyone else.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.205
Anyway,
things to do before I go.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.382
See you Friday.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.689
-Friday.
-[door closes]

06:42.402 --> 06:45.100
Prime Minister.
Good of you

06:45.230 --> 06:47.407
-to see me.
-Good of you to come.

06:50.888 --> 06:52.194
Martha.

06:52.324 --> 06:53.543
Thomas.

07:02.770 --> 07:05.033
Prime Minister...

07:05.163 --> 07:06.904
-I need your help.
-[chuckles]

07:09.298 --> 07:11.126
-Go on.
-We have an agent

07:11.256 --> 07:13.650
inside the Raven Union.

07:13.781 --> 07:15.696
A top-ranking scientist

07:15.826 --> 07:17.175
working on
the Stormcloud project.

07:17.306 --> 07:19.830
The Union doesn't know
he's a CIA plant.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.005
He's asked
to be pulled out ASAP--

07:21.136 --> 07:23.138
like, yesterday--

07:23.268 --> 07:24.835
without blowing his cover.

07:26.054 --> 07:29.057
A League kidnapping
would be convincing.

07:29.187 --> 07:31.146
What is Stormcloud exactly?

07:31.276 --> 07:33.104
We're fairly sure it's some

07:33.235 --> 07:34.671
new kind of chemical weapon,
but that's all we know.

07:34.802 --> 07:36.107
That's all we know.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.935
It's why we want
to speak to our guy ASAP.

07:38.066 --> 07:39.633
AZIZ: We could retrieve
this scientist for you,

07:39.763 --> 07:40.851
but why would we?

07:40.982 --> 07:42.200
The CIA are backing the Union,

07:42.331 --> 07:44.202
actively working for our defeat.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.161
Well, your defeat's
a foregone conclusion.

07:47.815 --> 07:50.295
The CIA likes to back winners.

07:50.426 --> 07:51.819
Winners who'll
immediately declare war

07:51.949 --> 07:53.821
on Scotland and Wales.

07:53.951 --> 07:56.301
Winners who plan to
"take back the empire."

07:56.432 --> 07:58.434
Winners who'll rule
by violence and fear.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.131
Who doesn't rule
by violence and fear?

08:00.262 --> 08:01.306
-That's...
-Restrain yourself, Martha.

08:01.437 --> 08:03.091
Thomas is speaking
for his government.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.746
I'm sure his personal feelings
are entirely honorable.

08:05.876 --> 08:08.836
But I don't see
how this favor works.

08:08.966 --> 08:11.491
Short of switching sides, what
can you do for us in return?

08:11.621 --> 08:13.710
Well, if we can't do anything
for the League,

08:13.841 --> 08:16.365
what can we do for you?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.802
For you, personally, I mean.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.936
At last.
I thought you'd never ask.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.285
Go on.

08:23.415 --> 08:26.288
You're close
to Aleister Crowley.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.290
Close? No.

08:28.420 --> 08:29.160
AZIZ:
Well, you speak to him.

08:30.292 --> 08:31.728
When necessary.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.077
AZIZ:
Perhaps you can

08:33.208 --> 08:35.036
pass along a message.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.734
Warn him that John Ripper

08:37.865 --> 08:40.345
plans to abduct and murder him.

08:40.476 --> 08:43.087
I'd tell him myself,
but it's far more credible

08:43.218 --> 08:44.262
coming from you.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.090
If that's all you want, I...

08:46.221 --> 08:48.092
I won't ask why.

08:48.223 --> 08:49.616
That's all.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.356
THOMAS:
Done.

08:51.487 --> 08:54.142
Our scientist is well-protected
by Union bodyguards.

08:54.272 --> 08:56.187
You'll need good men

08:56.318 --> 08:58.363
known by all
as League operatives.

08:58.494 --> 09:00.148
Alfred Pennyworth
would be the best choice,

09:00.278 --> 09:02.411
if he's willing.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.631
I expect I can persuade him.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.589
Thank you, sir.

09:12.813 --> 09:14.031
Martha.

09:14.162 --> 09:15.685
Thomas.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.605
I'd like you to handle this one
if you would, Martha.

09:22.736 --> 09:25.303
Of course, but I don't
understand what you're doing.

09:25.434 --> 09:28.480
[sighs]
A favor for a powerful man.

09:28.611 --> 09:31.309
And the rare chance for you to
speak to a Raven Union scientist

09:31.440 --> 09:33.050
about this Stormcloud business.

09:33.181 --> 09:34.835
I get all that.
What I don't underst...

09:38.839 --> 09:40.101
Excuse me.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.757
[Martha retching]

09:45.976 --> 09:47.151
[coughs]

09:47.282 --> 09:48.413
[water running]

09:48.544 --> 09:50.111
[toilet flushes]

09:53.331 --> 09:54.898
Excuse me.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.382
Are you all right?

10:00.512 --> 10:03.211
Uh... yeah, I'm fine.
[short chuckle]

10:05.256 --> 10:07.128
I'm fine. Um...

10:09.347 --> 10:11.349
What's the deal
with Ripper and Crowley?

10:11.480 --> 10:13.482
I would have thought
that was obvious.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.137
Ripper wants my job,
and I don't want him to have it.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.052
That's the second time
you've been sick this morning.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.097
I'm fine.

10:37.724 --> 10:41.379
â™ª Five-story fire
as you came.â™ª

10:41.510 --> 10:42.816
Hello, Sandra.

10:42.946 --> 10:45.035
Hello, sweetheart.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.517
There's no need to apologize.
I knew you wouldn't show up.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.780
-What?
-Recording session?

10:50.911 --> 10:53.870
Oh. Yeah. Sorry.
Uh, work.

10:54.001 --> 10:56.090
Yeah, I know, I know.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.309
You never change.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.268
Do you want to hear
me new number?

11:00.398 --> 11:02.618
We call 'em numbers
in show business, not songs.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.838
-Don't know why.
-Yeah, maybe later.

11:04.968 --> 11:06.056
Let's have a chat first.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.842
Your face.

11:08.972 --> 11:11.018
You'd think somebody had died.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.541
It was only a recording session.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.674
There'll be more, hopefully.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.286
Nobody has died, have they?

11:18.416 --> 11:20.505
-No, no. Nothing like that.
-Oh, thank God.

11:20.636 --> 11:22.899
-Feel like a right lemon.
-[soft chuckle]

11:23.030 --> 11:24.205
What's wrong, then?

11:25.380 --> 11:27.469
There's nothing wrong.

11:27.599 --> 11:30.167
No, it's-it's
a good thing, really.

11:30.298 --> 11:32.082
When all's said and done.

11:33.605 --> 11:36.043
You know...

11:36.173 --> 11:37.827
you know how I've always said
I'm no good for you, Sand?

11:37.958 --> 11:39.220
Well...

11:39.350 --> 11:41.048
I've always said that,
haven't I?

11:41.178 --> 11:43.485
Yeah, it's the first thing
you ever said to me, I think.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.095
It's a good thing
I don't listen to you.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.576
But it's true, isn't it?
You know that.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.970
Girl with prospects like you.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.449
Prospects.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.190
Well, show business and that.

11:53.321 --> 11:54.844
Oh, right, that.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.759
I'm leaving, Sandra.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.110
I'm going to America.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.983
Soon as I can arrange it.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.116
America.

12:11.078 --> 12:13.123
You mean without me?

12:14.342 --> 12:16.300
Well, I'd take you, but...

12:16.431 --> 12:18.215
you know, I need
to be ducking and diving.

12:18.346 --> 12:19.739
It wouldn't be fair on you.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.134
Um...

12:24.265 --> 12:26.136
I thought...

12:29.009 --> 12:30.750
I love you.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.404
I love you, too.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.885
In my way.

12:38.496 --> 12:39.541
Don't cry.

12:39.671 --> 12:41.282
Don't tell me what to do.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.153
I can cry if I like.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.764
Yeah. Sorry.

12:48.028 --> 12:49.072
Oh.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.598
What's that?

12:53.729 --> 12:55.252
That's an apology.

12:55.383 --> 12:56.950
I suppose.

12:57.080 --> 12:59.430
For messing you about.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.912
Money.

13:05.262 --> 13:07.221
I have to go.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.614
I don't know what else to do.
I have to leave.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.181
I'm sorry, Sandra.

13:11.312 --> 13:13.531
Yeah. So you keep saying.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.970
That's all right. I understand.

13:17.100 --> 13:19.233
You have to go.

13:19.363 --> 13:22.584
Thank you
for telling me the truth.

13:22.714 --> 13:25.152
-That's very considerate of you.
-Sandra, I...

13:25.282 --> 13:27.676
Some blokes would have just left
without saying anything.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.765
I'd have been ever so worried
if you'd done that,

13:29.896 --> 13:32.420
not knowing
where you'd gone, so...

13:33.508 --> 13:35.205
that's good.

13:43.605 --> 13:47.565
I really hope you have
a very happy life.

General Thursday, sir.

16:25.854 --> 16:27.987
Thank you.

16:32.339 --> 16:34.776
Sir, might I speak freely?

16:34.906 --> 16:36.865
Of course, Lieutenant.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.519
Regarding Mrs. Gaunt...

16:40.260 --> 16:42.523
Yes?

16:42.653 --> 16:46.483
Frances Gaunt would never
be disloyal or treacherous.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.529
A mistake has been made.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.140
Has it?

16:51.271 --> 16:52.663
Go on.

16:56.363 --> 16:57.668
The Gaunt family and mine

16:57.799 --> 16:59.627
are from the same part
of the country.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.199
My sister's married
to her cousin.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.549
Good, solid people.

17:08.679 --> 17:11.595
A Gaunt would never be involved
in skullduggery of any sort.

17:11.726 --> 17:13.554
500 years.

17:13.684 --> 17:15.817
I expect
you must know best, then.

17:15.947 --> 17:18.515
I do.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.561
And I'll need your help
explaining to Lord Harwood

17:20.691 --> 17:22.389
that Frances Gaunt is innocent.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.521
My help?

17:24.652 --> 17:26.393
How could I help?

17:26.523 --> 17:28.395
Don't be obtuse.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.484
You have Harwood's ear.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.573
Bend it a little.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.270
Once you've prepared
the ground,

17:34.401 --> 17:35.837
I'll go to His Lordship

17:35.967 --> 17:38.361
and explain man-to-man
how he's been misled.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.235
I see.

17:42.365 --> 17:43.801
Simple as that.

17:45.586 --> 17:49.677
I'd be happy to help,
of course.

17:49.807 --> 17:52.201
But...

17:54.421 --> 17:56.466
what's in it for you?

17:56.597 --> 17:59.643
My good opinion of you.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.602
I should think
that's worth something.

18:01.732 --> 18:03.821
Indeed.

18:03.952 --> 18:07.260
You are

Alfie.

Don't look so scared.

18:51.391 --> 18:52.783
Oh, I'm not scared.

18:52.914 --> 18:54.481
Just surprised.

18:54.611 --> 18:57.440
You've been avoiding me.

18:57.571 --> 19:01.357
Uh, yeah. Sorry about that.
I've been very busy.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.403
I could have you hung
for disrespect.

19:03.533 --> 19:04.621
Steady on.

19:04.752 --> 19:06.536
It's not you. It's me.

19:06.667 --> 19:07.972
Not good enough for you, am I?

19:08.103 --> 19:09.626
No, you're not.

19:09.757 --> 19:10.758
Obviously.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.849

Oh, do relax.

19:18.592 --> 19:19.636
I'm taking the piss.

19:19.767 --> 19:21.290
We're here to talk business.

19:22.422 --> 19:23.423
Oh.

19:23.553 --> 19:24.946
Well.

19:25.076 --> 19:27.601
We have a job for you.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.429
Thanks for thinking of me
and all that,

19:29.559 --> 19:31.518
but I'm not
in that business anymore.

19:31.648 --> 19:32.954
I'm leaving London.

19:33.084 --> 19:35.957
I know. America.
I'm very envious.

19:36.087 --> 19:37.785
Fuck's sake, does every bastard
know my plans?

19:37.915 --> 19:39.526
The job we have in mind
won't take long.

19:39.656 --> 19:41.658
It's a simple extraction.

19:41.789 --> 19:44.139
Every job's simple
until it isn't. No, thanks.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.402
I do understand
your reservations,

19:46.533 --> 19:48.491
but I'm afraid I must insist.

19:48.622 --> 19:51.712
It's a matter of state security.
Most important.

19:51.842 --> 19:53.757
We'll pay you very well.

19:53.888 --> 19:55.455
I don't need your money.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.718
Well, then we
won't pay you with money.

19:59.023 --> 20:01.678
We'll pay you with silence.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.550
What's that mean?

20:03.680 --> 20:05.508
Well, do you really need
or want me to explain?

20:05.639 --> 20:07.380
Yeah. I do.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.295
Talk straight.

20:10.339 --> 20:13.647
You're meeting privately
with another man's wife.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.388
[chuckles softly]

20:15.518 --> 20:16.824
Who told you that?

20:16.954 --> 20:18.608
Someone's been mugging you off.

20:19.740 --> 20:20.915
Amazing.

20:21.045 --> 20:24.223
He lies with such conviction.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.661
And to be fair, Your Majesty,

20:27.791 --> 20:28.792
perhaps yet again
we have been misinformed.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.838
-Mm.
-But it doesn't really matter,

20:30.968 --> 20:32.143
does it, now?

20:32.274 --> 20:33.580
Once revealed,
that sort of story

20:33.710 --> 20:35.625

20:35.756 --> 20:40.239
I gather the relevant husband
is a man of strong feelings.

20:40.369 --> 20:43.503
You think you can scare me
into working for you?

20:43.633 --> 20:44.982
No, no, no, of course not.
No, no, no.

20:45.113 --> 20:47.115
I think you're a gentleman.

20:47.246 --> 20:51.075
I think you'll protect the honor
of a woman at all costs.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.556
This is a new low.

Has he been acting strange
at all?

No.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.930
He might know.

22:03.060 --> 22:04.366
Is there somewhere you can go?

22:05.976 --> 22:08.936
No, that's okay. Friday's fine.

Don't take the chance.

Your hairdresser.

23:13.696 --> 23:15.611
Oh. [chuckles]

How strange.
I was just thinking of you.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.819
Really?
What were you thinking?

24:32.949 --> 24:34.168
Happy thoughts.

Get in.
We need to have a chat.

Do you think you can scare me

-Listen, John, I--
-Pentangles, I ask you.

25:46.632 --> 25:49.809
I've buried hundreds
of Satanists.

25:49.939 --> 25:51.027
And not one of them's
done anything

25:51.158 --> 25:53.029
except rot in their grave.

25:53.160 --> 25:55.684
You're just blood and guts
like everybody else.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.468
[laughs]

25:57.599 --> 25:59.383
And you have
the fucking temerity

25:59.514 --> 26:01.342
to threaten me

26:01.472 --> 26:03.910
with all
your black magic nonsense?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.694
I'm John fucking Ripper!

26:08.392 --> 26:10.656
And I eat men like you...

26:10.786 --> 26:13.049
for a snack.

26:14.311 --> 26:16.183
As a bit of light...

26:21.318 --> 26:22.711
Dear me.

26:22.842 --> 26:24.713
Driver?

26:33.374 --> 26:34.201
What's the matter with...

26:34.331 --> 26:36.116
[screams, grunts]

26:40.207 --> 26:42.122
â™ª

26:54.308 --> 26:56.615
[engine starts]

27:00.575 --> 27:02.664
[tires screech]

27:06.363 --> 27:08.104
[indistinct chatter]

27:14.589 --> 27:17.897
-Wake up!
-Oh, fuck!

27:18.027 --> 27:19.855
Hey.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.422
What, is that us off to America?

27:21.552 --> 27:23.206
Huh?

27:23.337 --> 27:25.339
-I'll get my last pint, then.
-Not yet.

27:25.469 --> 27:28.081
Soon. Couple of last-minute
bumps to handle.

27:28.211 --> 27:30.126
[chuckles]
So why'd you wake me up?

27:30.257 --> 27:32.085
I need you, Daveboy.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.304
One more job for Aziz
before we go.

27:34.435 --> 27:36.872
[Daveboy laughs]

27:37.003 --> 27:38.961
How did he manage that?

27:40.571 --> 27:42.617
What's he got on you?

27:42.748 --> 27:44.358
You don't need to come along
if you don't want to.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.360
[chuckles]
That bad, eh?

27:46.490 --> 27:48.275
Yeah.

27:48.405 --> 27:49.885
So tell us.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.365
You don't need to know.

27:51.495 --> 27:53.410
[scoffs]
No, you're right, I don't.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.195
I can't tell you everything.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.198
There's a lady involved.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.069
[laughs]

28:00.200 --> 28:01.462
Mrs. Troy.

28:01.592 --> 28:03.812
No.

28:03.943 --> 28:05.727
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

28:07.424 --> 28:09.513
Hang on, how the fuck
do you know that?

28:09.644 --> 28:12.125
Ah, Christ, man,
half the club knows.

28:12.255 --> 28:15.084
And I can read as well
as the next man, and she

28:15.215 --> 28:18.087
has got trouble written across
her forehead in red paint.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.176
-No, she's not like she seems.
-Aye.

28:20.307 --> 28:22.004
Aye, no doubt.

28:22.135 --> 28:23.963
You fucking suicidal
lunatic that you are.

28:24.093 --> 28:26.661
The wife of Gully Troy?
The fucking wife

28:26.792 --> 28:28.619
-of fucking Gully Troy?
-I know, I know.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.230
Do you recall what he did
to those prisoners

28:30.360 --> 28:32.232
in What-the-fuck-istan?

28:32.362 --> 28:35.278
Three days and nights they were
screaming like Cutty Sark.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.411
I remember.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.282
I hope you love the woman,
at least.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.502
[chuckles]

28:41.632 --> 28:43.591
Oh!

28:43.722 --> 28:46.725
You poor
quimstruck bastard, you.

28:49.858 --> 28:53.688
You know, I wish Bazza was here.
He'd know what to say to you.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.864
Yeah, well, Bazza's not here,
is he?

29:00.260 --> 29:02.349
So...

29:02.479 --> 29:05.091
what's the job, then?

29:05.221 --> 29:07.136
â™ª

29:18.452 --> 29:20.280
[indistinct chatter]

29:20.410 --> 29:22.151
[song begins quietly]

29:26.112 --> 29:28.288
So how are you guys?

29:28.418 --> 29:30.290
Truly.

29:30.420 --> 29:32.771
Swings and roundabouts.

29:34.424 --> 29:35.948
I'm sorry about Bazza.

29:36.078 --> 29:38.559
That's show business.

29:38.689 --> 29:41.040
You don't need to put on
a callous facade with me.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.390
I know how wounded
you must feel.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.131
Both of you.

29:45.261 --> 29:46.349
I'm all right.

29:48.221 --> 29:50.049
-Me, too.
-Really?

29:51.572 --> 29:52.965
I'd be racked by grief.

29:53.095 --> 29:54.401
And anger.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.577
And guilt.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.884
Well, that's you, isn't it?

29:59.014 --> 30:01.016
I'm all right.

30:01.147 --> 30:02.409
You look terrible.

30:02.539 --> 30:04.019
Thanks.

30:04.150 --> 30:05.499
You look lovely, by the way.

30:05.629 --> 30:08.067
Blooming.
I told you she'd start.

30:08.197 --> 30:10.156
[chuckles]
Straight for the throat.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.071
Like a fucking cobra.

30:12.201 --> 30:14.247
That's not fair.
I care for you guys,

30:14.377 --> 30:17.337
and I can see that you're both
torturing yourselves over Bazza.

30:17.467 --> 30:18.512
And you shouldn't.

30:18.642 --> 30:19.643
Steady on, duchess.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.602
It's bad luck to talk

30:21.732 --> 30:23.647
about lost comrades
when you're on a job.

30:23.778 --> 30:27.173
Very bad luck.
Might as well fuck an albatross.

30:27.303 --> 30:29.436
MARTHA:
Sorry.

30:29.566 --> 30:31.133
But you should just try
to forgive yourselves.

30:32.743 --> 30:35.050
That's all I'm saying.

30:35.181 --> 30:37.487
[entry bell jingles]

30:44.146 --> 30:45.974
[entry bell jingles]

30:48.194 --> 30:49.848
[Daveboy clears throat]

30:53.764 --> 30:56.245
[entry bell jingling]

31:04.427 --> 31:06.473
Fuck.

31:06.603 --> 31:09.780
Don't worry.
We'll do this nice and quiet.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.652
Those blokes don't want trouble
any more than we do.

31:11.782 --> 31:13.001
You think?

31:15.264 --> 31:17.440
Okay, ma'am, now,
this is important.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.486
You must place the cheese
on the patty

31:19.616 --> 31:21.531
while it's in the pan,

31:21.662 --> 31:23.707
and you must
let it melt properly.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.666
Then and only then

31:25.796 --> 31:28.756
do you put the patty
on the toastedbun

31:28.887 --> 31:30.714
and only then do you apply

31:30.845 --> 31:33.543
the lettuce and the tomato
and the onion.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.154
Are we clear?

31:36.285 --> 31:37.721
We'll see.

31:37.852 --> 31:40.028
"We'll see." Okay.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.688
MARTHA:
Hi. Excuse me, sorry.

31:47.818 --> 31:49.908
I heard your accent.
Are you American?

31:50.821 --> 31:52.040
Yes.

31:52.171 --> 31:53.563
Yes, I-I am.

31:53.694 --> 31:56.566
Oh, my God. Me, too.
That's so weird.

31:56.697 --> 31:59.526
I don't know what's weird
about shared nationality.

31:59.656 --> 32:01.223
[laughs]

32:02.616 --> 32:04.661
Tell me, do you know

32:04.792 --> 32:07.099
where I can get an acceptable
cheeseburger in this country?

32:07.229 --> 32:08.491
Move along, love.

32:08.622 --> 32:09.579
Excuse me?

32:09.710 --> 32:11.320
WALSH:
Move along.

32:11.451 --> 32:13.714
I asked her
a pertinent question.

32:13.844 --> 32:15.194
WALSH:
We've been over this, sir.

32:15.324 --> 32:17.413
No unauthorized communication.

32:17.544 --> 32:19.546
MARTHA [chuckles]:
Oh, gee. What are you,

32:19.676 --> 32:22.027
like, um,
a criminal or something?

32:22.157 --> 32:23.942
Or something.

32:24.855 --> 32:26.553
Hello.

32:26.683 --> 32:28.381
I'm Alfie.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.252
Who are you?

32:31.427 --> 32:33.299
Walsh.

32:33.429 --> 32:35.518
Walsh. What regiment?

32:35.649 --> 32:37.303
Before all this nonsense.

32:37.433 --> 32:39.087
â™ª Love me, too, fool...â™ª

32:39.218 --> 32:40.697
Paras.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.134
-Hmm.
-You?

32:42.264 --> 32:43.526
Catering Corps.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.615
â™ª Like you hurt me...â™ª

32:45.746 --> 32:48.401
Now, we have to take
this gentleman with us,

32:48.531 --> 32:50.229
and I was hoping
to do that nice and easy.

32:50.359 --> 32:51.534
No fuss.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.623
SAS, is it?

32:55.625 --> 32:58.411
There's three of you,
three of us.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.456
More outside.

33:00.587 --> 33:04.243
All Paras, as it happens.

33:04.373 --> 33:06.375
Any cunt can fall
out of an airplane.

33:06.506 --> 33:10.989
Yeah.
Show a gun, see what occurs.

33:12.903 --> 33:15.341
Ma'am? Ma'am,
there's about to be violence.

33:15.471 --> 33:16.559
-You need to leave. No.
-But I just ordered.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.257
You need to leave now.

33:18.387 --> 33:20.650
-Folks, listen...
-Sir, shut it.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.435
Walsh, I'm trying
to avoid trouble.

33:22.565 --> 33:24.785
Fuck off, then.

33:24.915 --> 33:26.830
-[entry bell jingles]
-I wish I could.

33:26.961 --> 33:28.702
Think about your family.

33:28.832 --> 33:30.486
You got family, haven't you?

33:30.617 --> 33:31.835
â™ª That hurt me...â™ª

33:31.966 --> 33:34.534
None to speak of.

33:34.664 --> 33:36.536
â™ª Untrue...â™ª

33:37.624 --> 33:38.625
None?

33:38.755 --> 33:40.757
No.

33:45.893 --> 33:48.243
It saves money at Christmas.

33:48.374 --> 33:50.506
Hmm.

34:00.647 --> 34:05.173
â™ª Knowing I love you soâ™ª

34:07.828 --> 34:11.745
â™ª Anyone who had a heart
would take me in his armsâ™ª

34:11.875 --> 34:15.314
â™ª And love me, too, foolâ™ª

34:15.444 --> 34:17.794
â™ª Couldn't be another heartâ™ª

34:17.925 --> 34:21.798
â™ª That hurt me
like you hurt me...â™ª

34:21.929 --> 34:23.409
-[Alfred] Any damage?
-MARTHA: I'm okay.

34:23.539 --> 34:24.584
Daveboy?

34:25.802 --> 34:28.240
Meh. Just a scratch.

34:29.806 --> 34:31.199
Hey.

34:35.986 --> 34:37.292
[shouts]

34:37.423 --> 34:38.728
Professor Fox? We have to go.

34:38.859 --> 34:40.295
No kidding.

34:40.426 --> 34:41.688
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

34:41.818 --> 34:43.211
[entry bell jingles]

34:43.342 --> 34:46.345
Oh, shit.

34:46.475 --> 34:49.609
Um, uh,
I'm sorry about all this.

34:49.739 --> 34:51.915
Long live the League!

34:52.046 --> 34:54.222
[entry bell jingles]

34:57.921 --> 35:00.228
-[Daveboy] Clear.
-You can sit up now, Professor.

35:00.359 --> 35:02.796
Fuck!

35:02.926 --> 35:04.493
Why'd he do that?

35:04.624 --> 35:05.712
I tried to reason with the man.

35:05.842 --> 35:08.584
-Paras. Fuck 'em.
-LUCIUS: Was that

35:08.715 --> 35:10.934
seriously the best plan
you could come up with?

35:11.065 --> 35:13.154
Come on, now.

35:13.285 --> 35:14.547
We didn't have time
to come up with a clever plan.

35:14.677 --> 35:18.290
We were told
you needed to be rescued ASAP.

35:18.420 --> 35:20.379
I'm Martha Kane.
Nice to meet you.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.946
Nice to meet you. Lucius Fox.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.383
So, why'd you need
to get out so fast anyhow?

35:24.513 --> 35:25.949
-All kinds of reasons.
-MARTHA: Oh.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.429
You must be
a pretty important guy, huh?

35:27.560 --> 35:29.257
No. Not at all.

35:29.388 --> 35:30.650
Huh.

35:32.391 --> 35:34.480
So, you're a scientist?

35:34.610 --> 35:37.700
F-Forgive me,
what did you say your name was?

35:37.831 --> 35:38.788
Martha Kane.

35:38.919 --> 35:40.442
-Miss Kane?
-Mm-hmm.

35:40.573 --> 35:41.530
I'd dearly love to tell you
what I know.

35:41.661 --> 35:44.446
But I'm bound
by oaths of secrecy,

35:44.577 --> 35:46.796
so please understand
pumping me for information

35:46.927 --> 35:47.797
would be a sad waste
of your time.

35:58.068 --> 35:59.896
Abducted?

36:00.027 --> 36:02.508
How the devil did your people
let this happen?

36:02.638 --> 36:06.642
The League agents were led
by that ex-SAS chap Pennyworth.

36:06.773 --> 36:07.904
Took out five guards.

36:08.035 --> 36:09.732
Him again.

36:09.863 --> 36:11.343
I'm beginning to dislike
that chap.

36:11.473 --> 36:12.605
SALT:
On the bright side,

36:12.735 --> 36:14.172
Professor Fox
was a backroom boy.

36:14.302 --> 36:16.043
Not a crucial part
of the operational staff.

36:16.174 --> 36:17.653
Well, that's all well and good,

36:17.784 --> 36:19.394
but the League will know
all about Stormcloud now.

36:19.525 --> 36:21.091
Perhaps that's a blessing.

36:21.222 --> 36:24.747
After all, what good
is Stormcloud as a threat

36:24.878 --> 36:26.140
if the League doesn't believe it
to be genuine?

36:26.271 --> 36:28.969
Oh, they'll believe it.
When they're all choking

36:29.099 --> 36:30.623
to bloody death,
they'll believe it.

36:30.753 --> 36:32.015
THURSDAY: [chuckles]
Your lordship is being

36:32.146 --> 36:33.843
humorous, of course.

36:33.974 --> 36:36.716
We're not gonna actually
deploy the wretched thing.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.500
It's leverage. No more.

36:38.631 --> 36:41.808
Yes, yes. Humor. Humor.
Wishful thinking.

36:41.938 --> 36:44.593
Stormcloud is leverage,
merely leverage.

36:44.724 --> 36:47.205
As long as we understand
each other.

36:51.905 --> 36:53.776
Your pills, sir.

36:55.822 --> 36:57.737
These new?

36:57.867 --> 37:00.348
No, sir. The same medication.

37:01.784 --> 37:03.699
Different color.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.665
[exhales]

37:12.795 --> 37:16.016
He's a bit soft
for a soldier, isn't he?

37:16.146 --> 37:18.497
Like sponge cake, sir.

37:18.627 --> 37:20.716
[chuckles]

37:20.847 --> 37:22.718
You're a good fellow, Salt.

37:23.893 --> 37:25.808
I'm gonna need a new

37:25.939 --> 37:27.810
deputy chancellor
to replace Gaunt.

37:27.941 --> 37:30.509
I think I'll appoint you.

37:30.639 --> 37:32.772
Me, sir?

37:32.902 --> 37:35.688
I'm deeply honored, sir, but...

37:35.818 --> 37:37.559
But what?

37:37.690 --> 37:40.780
Honestly, I'm not worthy
of such a high position.

37:40.910 --> 37:45.088
A simple commoner like myself.
The staff would look down on me.

37:45.219 --> 37:47.395
Your manner
is somewhat plebeian, I suppose.

37:48.701 --> 37:50.529
Indeed, sir.

37:50.659 --> 37:53.488
Your advisor should be
a person of natural rank.

37:53.619 --> 37:56.926
Me, I'd cut a sad figure.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.101
Ah, well,
there's your answer, then.

37:58.232 --> 38:00.016
I shall give you a knighthood.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.543
What's wrong with a knighthood?

38:04.673 --> 38:07.633
SALT:
I'm a simple North Country lad.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.939
[chuckles softly] It'd take more
than a knighthood to elevate

38:10.070 --> 38:12.202
-the likes of me.
-Well, a baronet, then.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.900
Is that elevated enough
for you, hmm?

38:14.030 --> 38:15.945
-Dixon.
-DIXON: Yes, sir.

38:16.076 --> 38:17.947
I don't know what to say.

38:18.078 --> 38:19.862
Fetch the Duke of Windermere
away from his cocktail cabinet

38:19.993 --> 38:22.691
and have him make Salt here
a baronet

38:22.822 --> 38:23.997
as soon as is applicable.

38:24.127 --> 38:25.694
There you are, sir.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.217
You're a toff now. Well done.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.481
I'm deeply conscious
of the honor, sir.

38:29.611 --> 38:31.961
But? What else?

38:33.136 --> 38:35.835
I don't want to speak
out of turn, sir.

38:35.965 --> 38:38.098
But given my new role...

38:38.228 --> 38:42.102
Well, talk, man. Talk.

38:42.232 --> 38:45.540
Seems Gaunt
still has friends among us.

38:45.671 --> 38:48.282
Friends that still support her.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.458
Pushing quietly
to have her pardoned

38:50.589 --> 38:52.155
and brought back to power.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.767
Traitors, then. Who?

38:54.897 --> 38:56.812
I don't know.

38:56.943 --> 38:59.772
Whoever they are, they move
in higher circles than I do.

39:01.077 --> 39:03.993
I just hear rumors.
Perhaps it's not true.

39:04.124 --> 39:06.909
No, no, no, I-I...
I believe you.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.608
I suspected it.

39:09.738 --> 39:12.350
Treachery is-is contagious,

39:12.480 --> 39:15.614
and she would never
have dared act alone.

39:15.744 --> 39:19.357
Some wretch has corrupted her.

39:19.487 --> 39:22.925
And you, you-you must find out
who they are,

39:23.056 --> 39:24.971
-these-these friends of Gaunt.

39:25.101 --> 39:27.887
Mm. Above my pay grade,
as they say, sir.

39:31.934 --> 39:33.893
Mm.

39:40.987 --> 39:43.032
I'm no detective,

39:43.163 --> 39:46.688
but I suspect
they'll reveal themselves.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.386
Well, h-how?

39:48.516 --> 39:50.953
Gaunt can't be saved
without your permission.

39:51.084 --> 39:54.087
These traitors
will have to come to you

39:54.217 --> 39:56.916
-and argue for her release.
-That's true.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.700
Whoever comes to you,

39:58.831 --> 40:01.877
however reasonable they seem,
however loyal,

40:02.008 --> 40:03.879
that's your traitor.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.720
Professor Fox.

40:20.026 --> 40:21.984
Welcome home. Thomas Wayne.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.812
Mr. Wayne.

40:25.727 --> 40:28.251
Thank you for your assistance.

40:28.382 --> 40:29.992
[chuckles]
Oh, you're very welcome, sir.

40:30.123 --> 40:31.994
At your service.

40:32.125 --> 40:33.953
Well, goodbye, Professor Fox.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.042
I just know you and this one...

40:36.172 --> 40:38.914
you're gonna get along
like a house on fire.

40:41.047 --> 40:43.745
Goodbye, Miss Kane.

40:43.876 --> 40:45.791
THOMAS: I'm very happy
to meet you at last.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.097
Heard great things about you.

40:50.839 --> 40:53.233
I've heard very little
about you.

40:53.363 --> 40:55.627
Rich kid.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.803
New promotion.

40:57.933 --> 41:00.153
[laughs]
Well, that's, uh...

41:00.283 --> 41:02.198
That's me in a nutshell.

41:02.329 --> 41:06.594
Interesting woman, Martha Kane.

41:06.725 --> 41:08.857
Why do you think so?

41:08.988 --> 41:11.294
Just strikes me that way.

41:11.425 --> 41:14.733
Mm. You know, she's a character.

41:14.863 --> 41:17.823
You two are ex-lovers,
I suppose.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.608
-That's a very odd question.
-It wasn't a question.

41:20.739 --> 41:22.305
Observation.

41:22.436 --> 41:25.134
[chuckles softly]
It's that obvious, huh?

41:25.265 --> 41:27.789
What have you got for us,
Professor?

41:29.312 --> 41:32.315
Film...

41:32.446 --> 41:36.189
of the last Stormcloud trials.

41:36.319 --> 41:39.018
The new version is at least
five times more powerful

41:39.148 --> 41:40.062
than projected.

41:42.108 --> 41:44.327
They could kill
the entire population of London

41:44.458 --> 41:48.027
with a device
the size of a cigarette lighter.

41:49.202 --> 41:54.207
The active agent
attacks the limbic system.

41:54.337 --> 41:56.905
Victims die of terror.

41:57.036 --> 41:58.646
Literally.

42:00.430 --> 42:02.171
Ready for deployment
by next week.

42:03.738 --> 42:05.523
That is bad news.

42:06.872 --> 42:09.135
The president needs to step in.

42:09.265 --> 42:12.094
Harwood needs to know
if he deploys Stormcloud,

42:12.225 --> 42:14.967
America will squash him
like a june bug.

42:15.097 --> 42:17.796
Deployment of Stormcloud would
be the worst atrocity committed

42:17.926 --> 42:19.101
since World War II.
We're talking

42:19.232 --> 42:20.929
about hundreds
of thousands dead.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.931
Well,
that's a worst-case scenario.

42:23.062 --> 42:25.325
Unbalanced Harwood may be,
but he can't pull the trigger

42:25.455 --> 42:27.283
without the support
of the Army general staff.

42:27.414 --> 42:29.547
And they'd never agree
to such madness.

42:29.677 --> 42:33.115
All we can do right now
is pass along the intel

42:33.246 --> 42:35.553
-with a big red flag on it.
-[scoffs]

42:37.467 --> 42:39.034
A red flag?

42:39.165 --> 42:42.081
We supply the data,

42:42.211 --> 42:43.299
and Washington
makes the decision.

42:43.430 --> 42:45.780
And they'll do the right thing.

42:45.911 --> 42:47.869
America won't stand still
for a mass murder.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.306
I saw Stormcloud.

42:50.437 --> 42:53.962
I helped test it.
I saw people dying in agony,

42:54.093 --> 42:55.964
and I had to stand there
and do nothing

42:56.095 --> 42:57.705
with a goddamn clipboard
in my hand.

42:57.836 --> 42:59.098
If...

42:59.228 --> 43:02.231
If our government doesn't act...

43:04.190 --> 43:06.105
I damn sure will.

43:07.367 --> 43:08.586
And what will you do?

43:14.940 --> 43:17.812
You're CIA station chief.

43:17.943 --> 43:19.597
What will youdo?

43:30.303 --> 43:32.392
[panting]

43:32.522 --> 43:34.612
Hello?

43:35.525 --> 43:38.006
Hello?

43:40.574 --> 43:42.924
[echoes]:
Crowley?

43:44.099 --> 43:45.274
Crowley!

43:52.325 --> 43:54.893
I'm not scared!

43:57.460 --> 44:00.420
[laughs]
You drugged me!

44:00.550 --> 44:03.379
Well done!

44:03.510 --> 44:07.819
You're just making it worse
for yourself when I catch you.

44:07.949 --> 44:09.777
Do you hear me?!

44:09.908 --> 44:11.953
-Crowley!
-MAN: John.

44:17.263 --> 44:19.395
John...

44:20.483 --> 44:22.050
[panting]

44:22.181 --> 44:25.010
[grunts]

44:25.140 --> 44:27.665
What? What the...?

44:29.623 --> 44:31.712
[grunting, gasping]

44:33.540 --> 44:34.802
[cries out]

44:34.933 --> 44:35.977
[whispers]:
Oh, my God.

44:36.108 --> 44:37.979
[panting]

44:38.110 --> 44:41.461
[screaming]

44:41.591 --> 44:42.984
QUEEN:
Mr. Ripper?

44:43.115 --> 44:45.465
Mr. Ripper.

44:45.595 --> 44:47.685
Mr. Ripper, what's the meaning
of this behavior?

44:50.339 --> 44:52.037
What's wrong with him?

44:52.167 --> 44:53.952
Dear me, I don't know.

44:54.082 --> 44:55.693
Help me.

44:55.823 --> 44:57.303
He's had some kind
of nervous breakdown.

44:57.433 --> 44:58.826
Perhaps we should call a doctor.

44:58.957 --> 45:00.088
Yes.

45:00.219 --> 45:03.265
He's been under a lot of stress.

45:03.396 --> 45:07.400
A long rest in Bedlam will do
him a power of good, poor chap.

45:07.530 --> 45:09.532
Why? Why is this happening?

45:09.663 --> 45:12.318
[Ripper groans, exhales]

45:12.448 --> 45:14.755
[whimpering]

45:14.886 --> 45:16.844
[panting]

45:18.977 --> 45:21.196
[panting]

45:21.327 --> 45:23.242
[gasps]

45:23.372 --> 45:26.158
It was me, old friend.

45:26.288 --> 45:28.334
I did this to you.

45:28.464 --> 45:30.728
[gasps]

45:34.644 --> 45:36.298
[groans]

45:36.429 --> 45:38.997
[both growling]

45:40.433 --> 45:43.436
[yelling]

45:43.566 --> 45:46.308
[whimpering and groaning]

45:46.439 --> 45:50.051
No! No! No! No, no!

45:50.182 --> 45:52.053
[yelling]

45:52.184 --> 45:55.404
[whimpering]

45:55.535 --> 45:57.624
[indistinct crowd chatter]

45:57.755 --> 46:01.410
[Daveboy] Another day,
another fucking massacre.

46:01.541 --> 46:02.977
I need a drink.

46:03.108 --> 46:04.457
Juice? Whiskey, please.

46:04.587 --> 46:06.241
BARTENDER:
Coming up.

46:06.372 --> 46:10.071
I tried, didn't I?
I tried to do things peaceful.

46:10.202 --> 46:14.423
Well, I hope America's
worth all this shite.

46:14.554 --> 46:17.122
How many people have died
to get us there?

46:17.252 --> 46:20.125
-Mm.
-I want a word with you.

46:20.255 --> 46:22.954
All right, Sid.
Look, I know Sandra's upset.

46:23.084 --> 46:24.607
Don't you even mention her name.

46:24.738 --> 46:26.000
My Sandra's too good
for a dosser like you.

46:26.131 --> 46:27.175
Yes, she is, yeah.

46:27.306 --> 46:28.524
She hasn't stopped crying.

46:28.655 --> 46:30.483
-Look, I'm sorry. I am.
-Yeah.

46:30.613 --> 46:31.658
Full of remorse, ain't ya?

46:31.789 --> 46:33.529
Real gentleman you are.

46:33.660 --> 46:35.662
Why don't you sod off
to America, you cunt?

46:35.793 --> 46:38.534
-Good riddance.
-[sighs]

46:38.665 --> 46:40.362
[sniffles]

46:40.493 --> 46:43.148
-[crowd chatter]
-[piano music playing]

46:43.278 --> 46:44.714
You had that coming.

46:44.845 --> 46:47.369
-Fuck off, Daveboy.
-Fuck off, yourself.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.284
I'm sick and bloody tired

46:49.415 --> 46:51.112
of everyone blaming me
for everything, all right?

46:51.243 --> 46:52.897
I'm just trying to make
something of myself, that's all.

46:53.027 --> 46:54.724
Oh, aye, well,

46:54.855 --> 46:56.988
you've made something
of yourself, that's for sure.

46:57.118 --> 46:59.338
-Shut it!
-Oh, aye?

46:59.468 --> 47:02.515
Or else what, eh? Hey?

47:02.645 --> 47:04.517
Fuck off and get drunk.

47:04.647 --> 47:06.214
Leave me alone.

47:06.345 --> 47:07.955
Aye.

47:10.740 --> 47:12.351
-Fucking move.
-WOMAN: Oh! [laughs]

47:21.577 --> 47:23.971
[sniffles, sighs]

47:46.646 --> 47:47.995
Bad day, was it?

47:52.391 --> 47:54.523
Had worse.

47:55.655 --> 47:57.700
Where's your hanky?

47:57.831 --> 47:59.137
Ain't got one.

47:59.267 --> 48:00.703
[sighs]

48:00.834 --> 48:04.620
How many times
have I told you?

48:04.751 --> 48:06.144
Always have
a clean hanky with you.

48:06.274 --> 48:07.754
-[sniffles]
-Not like that.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.408
You'll make the bleeding worse.

48:11.758 --> 48:13.499
[sniffles]

48:16.806 --> 48:18.765
[sighs]

48:18.896 --> 48:21.159
Remember your first bloody nose?

48:21.289 --> 48:25.293
Marjorie Pimm,
the milkie's daughter.

48:26.860 --> 48:28.731
You tried to kiss her.

48:28.862 --> 48:31.909
Gave me a right kicking.

48:32.039 --> 48:35.086
You've not been far
from trouble ever since.

48:35.216 --> 48:37.349
I've tried.

48:37.479 --> 48:40.918
You've tried,
but not hard enough.

48:41.048 --> 48:44.530
There's something
about trouble that you like.

48:44.660 --> 48:47.446
I'm sorry, Mum, for everything.

48:47.576 --> 48:50.405
Oh, I know you are.

48:50.536 --> 48:52.320
That's my only consolation.

48:52.451 --> 48:55.062
I know you're ashamed
of yourself.

48:57.891 --> 48:59.371
I don't know what to do
with you anymore.

48:59.501 --> 49:00.720
Mum...

49:00.850 --> 49:02.548
Shh.

49:02.678 --> 49:04.593
Your dad would like me
to look after you,

49:04.724 --> 49:07.466
keep you out of mischief.

49:07.596 --> 49:10.556
How can I do that if
you're thousands of miles away?

49:10.686 --> 49:12.123
[sighs] I can't.

49:12.253 --> 49:14.386
You can't.

49:17.084 --> 49:20.696
So... I will come with you
to bloody America,

49:20.827 --> 49:22.437
on one condition.

49:22.568 --> 49:24.135
What's that, then?

49:24.265 --> 49:26.528
No guns, no violence,

49:26.659 --> 49:29.096
and you'll give me
some grandchildren.

49:29.227 --> 49:31.664
That's three conditions.

49:31.794 --> 49:34.536
And we can't live anywhere
near their bears or wolves.

49:34.667 --> 49:36.321
Or snakes.

49:36.451 --> 49:38.105
Promise.

49:40.281 --> 49:42.588
All right, then.

49:42.718 --> 49:45.417
[laughs softly]

49:48.681 --> 49:52.685
â™ª The look of loveâ™ª

49:52.815 --> 49:57.733
â™ª Is in your eyesâ™ª

49:57.864 --> 50:00.258
â™ª A lookâ™ª

50:00.388 --> 50:05.306
â™ª Your smile can't disguise...â™ª

50:05.437 --> 50:07.091
Hi, Martha.

50:07.221 --> 50:09.615
How was your day?

50:09.745 --> 50:11.834
Shitty.

50:11.965 --> 50:13.749
[instrumental interlude plays]

50:15.925 --> 50:18.015
[sighs]

50:19.668 --> 50:21.366
What the fuck are you doing?

50:21.496 --> 50:22.889
Art.

50:23.020 --> 50:26.240
I said you could stay over.

50:26.371 --> 50:28.373
I didn't say
you could paint naked men.

50:28.503 --> 50:30.288
Didn't say I couldn't.

50:30.418 --> 50:32.420
Whatever.

50:36.511 --> 50:38.383
So what have you been doing?

50:38.513 --> 50:39.819
[sighs heavily]

50:39.949 --> 50:42.213
-[phone ringing]
-I have been...

50:42.343 --> 50:44.737
watching people die.

50:44.867 --> 50:46.521
Bummer.

50:46.652 --> 50:48.088
[ringing continues]

50:48.219 --> 50:49.655
Yeah.

50:49.785 --> 50:51.744
THOMAS:
Hi, Martha. Please call me

50:51.874 --> 50:53.441
as soon as you get this message.

50:53.572 --> 50:56.009
It's very important. Call me.

50:56.140 --> 50:58.707
-[phone machine clicks off]
-Like hell I will.

51:00.796 --> 51:04.061
Sweetheart,
will you fuck off, please?

51:06.759 --> 51:08.717
So...

51:08.848 --> 51:11.198
â™ª That time...â™ª

51:11.329 --> 51:12.547
You haven't told him?

51:12.678 --> 51:14.854
Told him what?

51:14.984 --> 51:18.292
That you're pregnant.

51:18.423 --> 51:20.642
â™ª Be mine tonight...â™ª

51:20.773 --> 51:21.904
How do you know?

51:22.035 --> 51:25.952
You have that... special glow.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.997
Fuck off. How do you know?

51:28.128 --> 51:30.478
â™ª So many nights like this...â™ª

51:30.609 --> 51:34.482
You're farting all the time,
and your tits are magnificent.

51:34.613 --> 51:36.441
[laughs]

51:36.571 --> 51:38.747
Fuck.

51:38.878 --> 51:41.185
So you haven't told him?

51:41.315 --> 51:42.882
No, not yet.

51:43.012 --> 51:45.319
Don't blame you.
He will freak the fuck out.

51:45.450 --> 51:47.669
Thanks a lot. I know.

51:47.800 --> 51:50.411
That's why I haven't told him.

51:50.542 --> 51:52.718
So, um...

51:52.848 --> 51:55.373
do you want to know
if it's a boy or a girl?

51:58.376 --> 52:00.291
No, I don't.

52:00.421 --> 52:02.467
Please yourself.

52:02.597 --> 52:07.776
â™ª Don't ever goâ™ª

52:12.607 --> 52:15.697
[indistinct chatter]

52:15.828 --> 52:17.873
-Have you got that, Dixon?
-Yes, sir.

52:18.004 --> 52:19.614
-Right, well, run along.
-Sir.

52:20.789 --> 52:22.791
Good evening, sir.

52:22.922 --> 52:24.880
Dispatches
from General Thursday.

52:28.841 --> 52:33.150
Oh. I understand
congratulations are in order.

52:37.066 --> 52:38.851
Sir John.

52:38.981 --> 52:42.028
Thank you so much.

52:42.159 --> 52:44.422
I am deeply humbled
by the honor done me.

52:53.126 --> 52:55.476
Sir, might I have a moment
of your time?

52:55.607 --> 52:56.999
Carry on.

52:57.130 --> 52:58.827
Regarding Mrs. Gaunt--

52:58.958 --> 53:01.526
I've made enquiries, sir.

53:01.656 --> 53:04.964
Enquiries? Jolly good.

53:05.094 --> 53:07.401
Everyone I spoke to believes
she's innocent

53:07.532 --> 53:08.968
of the charges against her.

53:09.098 --> 53:11.666
Oh, do they?
Interesting, Sir John?

53:11.797 --> 53:14.495
Indeed.

53:14.626 --> 53:17.019
Well, go on.

53:17.150 --> 53:20.240
I suspect
she was framed somehow.

53:20.371 --> 53:23.504
A cunning plot was devised
to deceive you and ruin her.

53:23.635 --> 53:25.985
To what end?

53:26.115 --> 53:27.421
With her gone,
I imagine it was thought

53:27.552 --> 53:30.642
you'd be more isolated, alone.

53:30.772 --> 53:33.035
She was your closest advisor,
was she not?

53:33.166 --> 53:34.559
An old friend.

53:34.689 --> 53:36.474
She was.

53:36.604 --> 53:37.649
Who better
to take from you, sir?

53:37.779 --> 53:41.218
What greater loss
could you suffer?

53:45.091 --> 53:47.485
Who sent you?

53:47.615 --> 53:50.618
Nobody, sir.
I came of my own accord.

53:50.749 --> 53:52.577
Nonsense. You're not the leader
of this conspiracy.

53:52.707 --> 53:53.926
A little pipsqueak like you.

53:54.056 --> 53:55.188
You're working
for somebody else.

53:55.319 --> 53:57.625
Conspiracy, sir?
I don't follow you.

53:57.756 --> 53:59.410
Don't you take me
for a fool, boy.

53:59.540 --> 54:02.978
Hmm? Who sent you?

54:03.109 --> 54:04.806
-You tell me.
-Your Lordship.

54:04.937 --> 54:07.026
Shut up, Dixon!
Are you part of this, too?

54:07.156 --> 54:08.506
GREAVES: I think we are
at cross-purposes, sir.

54:08.636 --> 54:09.898
I am here solely
to defend the honor...

54:10.029 --> 54:11.204
You tell me the truth, boy!

54:11.335 --> 54:13.380
With all respect,
I resent this treatment!

54:13.511 --> 54:15.861
-[Greaves groans]
-[gasps]

54:15.991 --> 54:17.515
You treacherous dog.

54:17.645 --> 54:19.908
[groaning]

54:20.039 --> 54:23.695
[grunting]

54:23.825 --> 54:27.916
-[grunting]
-[guttural groaning]

54:28.047 --> 54:30.310
[shouting gibberish]

54:32.094 --> 54:33.835

54:33.966 --> 54:36.316
-[metallic thud]
-[gasps]

54:37.535 --> 54:39.406
[groans]

54:39.537 --> 54:41.800

54:45.978 --> 54:47.806
[wheezy panting]

54:52.027 --> 54:54.116
[gasps]

54:54.247 --> 54:56.293
[loud panting]

55:05.911 --> 55:08.479
[panting continues]

55:08.609 --> 55:10.655
You heard him!

55:10.785 --> 55:13.527
He admitted it!

55:13.658 --> 55:16.791
He's a bloody traitor.

55:16.922 --> 55:19.316
He's a traitor!

55:22.754 --> 55:24.625
He's dead.

55:28.803 --> 55:30.805
What the hell?

55:30.936 --> 55:32.677
What happened here?

55:32.807 --> 55:33.765
The man's a traitor.

55:33.895 --> 55:36.028
Are you mad?

55:36.158 --> 55:38.030
What have you done?

55:38.160 --> 55:39.814
[panting]

55:39.945 --> 55:41.425
He confessed it.

55:41.555 --> 55:43.688
We all heard him.

55:43.818 --> 55:47.169
Nonsense. Greaves was
the best man on my staff.

55:47.300 --> 55:49.868
I see. I see it all.

55:49.998 --> 55:51.913
It's you.

55:52.044 --> 55:55.134
You're the snake!
You're the traitor!

55:55.264 --> 55:56.483
It's you!

55:56.614 --> 55:58.137
Guards?

55:58.267 --> 56:01.619
Guards!

56:02.707 --> 56:05.884
Take Lord Harwood away
and confine him to his quarters.

56:07.668 --> 56:10.367
No. No.

56:11.629 --> 56:13.935
No. No...

56:16.851 --> 56:18.679
[quietly]:
No.

56:20.377 --> 56:23.945
No. No, no, no, no, no.

56:24.076 --> 56:27.732
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

56:27.862 --> 56:29.168
Please.

56:29.298 --> 56:31.388
No, not me.

56:34.042 --> 56:36.871
I can't. I can't.
