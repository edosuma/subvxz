37:25.939 --> 37:27.810
deputy chancellor
to replace Gaunt.

37:27.941 --> 37:30.509
I think I'll appoint you.

37:30.639 --> 37:32.772
Me, sir?

37:32.902 --> 37:35.688
I'm deeply honored, sir, but...

37:35.818 --> 37:37.559
But what?

37:37.690 --> 37:40.780
Honestly, I'm not worthy
of such a high position.

37:40.910 --> 37:45.088
A simple commoner like myself.
The staff would look down on me.

37:45.219 --> 37:47.395
Your manner
is somewhat plebeian, I suppose.

37:48.701 --> 37:50.529
Indeed, sir.

37:50.659 --> 37:53.488
Your advisor should be
a person of natural rank.

37:53.619 --> 37:56.926
Me, I'd cut a sad figure.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.101
Ah, well,
there's your answer, then.

37:58.232 --> 38:00.016
I shall give you a knighthood.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.543
What's wrong with a knighthood?

38:04.673 --> 38:07.633
SALT:
I'm a simple North Country lad.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.939
[chuckles softly] It'd take more
than a knighthood to elevate

38:10.070 --> 38:12.202
-the likes of me.
-Well, a baronet, then.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.900
Is that elevated enough
for you, hmm?

38:14.030 --> 38:15.945
-Dixon.
-DIXON: Yes, sir.

38:16.076 --> 38:17.947
I don't know what to say.

38:18.078 --> 38:19.862
Fetch the Duke of Windermere
away from his cocktail cabinet

38:19.993 --> 38:22.691
and have him make Salt here
a baronet

38:22.822 --> 38:23.997
as soon as is applicable.

38:24.127 --> 38:25.694
There you are, sir.

38:25.825 --> 38:27.217
You're a toff now. Well done.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.481
I'm deeply conscious
of the honor, sir.

38:29.611 --> 38:31.961
But? What else?

38:33.136 --> 38:35.835
I don't want to speak
out of turn, sir.

38:35.965 --> 38:38.098
But given my new role...

38:38.228 --> 38:42.102
Well, talk, man. Talk.

38:42.232 --> 38:45.540
Seems Gaunt
still has friends among us.

38:45.671 --> 38:48.282
Friends that still support her.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.458
Pushing quietly
to have her pardoned

38:50.589 --> 38:52.155
and brought back to power.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.767
Traitors, then. Who?

38:54.897 --> 38:56.812
I don't know.

38:56.943 --> 38:59.772
Whoever they are, they move
in higher circles than I do.

39:01.077 --> 39:03.993
I just hear rumors.
Perhaps it's not true.

39:04.124 --> 39:06.909
No, no, no, I-I...
I believe you.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.608
I suspected it.

39:09.738 --> 39:12.350
Treachery is-is contagious,

39:12.480 --> 39:15.614
and she would never
have dared act alone.

39:15.744 --> 39:19.357
Some wretch has corrupted her.

39:19.487 --> 39:22.925
And you, you-you must find out
who they are,

39:23.056 --> 39:24.971
-these-these friends of Gaunt.

39:25.101 --> 39:27.887
Mm. Above my pay grade,
as they say, sir.

39:31.934 --> 39:33.893
Mm.

39:40.987 --> 39:43.032
I'm no detective,

39:43.163 --> 39:46.688
but I suspect
they'll reveal themselves.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.386
Well, h-how?

39:48.516 --> 39:50.953
Gaunt can't be saved
without your permission.

39:51.084 --> 39:54.087
These traitors
will have to come to you

39:54.217 --> 39:56.916
-and argue for her release.
-That's true.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.700
Whoever comes to you,

39:58.831 --> 40:01.877
however reasonable they seem,
however loyal,

40:02.008 --> 40:03.879
that's your traitor.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.720
Professor Fox.

40:20.026 --> 40:21.984
Welcome home. Thomas Wayne.

40:22.115 --> 40:23.812
Mr. Wayne.

40:25.727 --> 40:28.251
Thank you for your assistance.

40:28.382 --> 40:29.992
[chuckles]
Oh, you're very welcome, sir.

40:30.123 --> 40:31.994
At your service.

40:32.125 --> 40:33.953
Well, goodbye, Professor Fox.

40:34.083 --> 40:36.042
I just know you and this one...

40:36.172 --> 40:38.914
you're gonna get along
like a house on fire.

40:41.047 --> 40:43.745
Goodbye, Miss Kane.

40:43.876 --> 40:45.791
THOMAS: I'm very happy
to meet you at last.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.097
Heard great things about you.

40:50.839 --> 40:53.233
I've heard very little
about you.

40:53.363 --> 40:55.627
Rich kid.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.803
New promotion.

40:57.933 --> 41:00.153
[laughs]
Well, that's, uh...

41:00.283 --> 41:02.198
That's me in a nutshell.

41:02.329 --> 41:06.594
Interesting woman, Martha Kane.

41:06.725 --> 41:08.857
Why do you think so?

41:08.988 --> 41:11.294
Just strikes me that way.

41:11.425 --> 41:14.733
Mm. You know, she's a character.

41:14.863 --> 41:17.823
You two are ex-lovers,
I suppose.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.608
-That's a very odd question.
-It wasn't a question.

41:20.739 --> 41:22.305
Observation.

41:22.436 --> 41:25.134
[chuckles softly]
It's that obvious, huh?

41:25.265 --> 41:27.789
What have you got for us,
Professor?

41:29.312 --> 41:32.315
Film...

41:32.446 --> 41:36.189
of the last Stormcloud trials.

41:36.319 --> 41:39.018
The new version is at least
five times more powerful

41:39.148 --> 41:40.062
than projected.

41:42.108 --> 41:44.327
They could kill
the entire population of London

41:44.458 --> 41:48.027
with a device
the size of a cigarette lighter.

41:49.202 --> 41:54.207
The active agent
attacks the limbic system.

41:54.337 --> 41:56.905
Victims die of terror.

41:57.036 --> 41:58.646
Literally.

42:00.430 --> 42:02.171
Ready for deployment
by next week.

42:03.738 --> 42:05.523
That is bad news.

42:06.872 --> 42:09.135
The president needs to step in.

42:09.265 --> 42:12.094
Harwood needs to know
if he deploys Stormcloud,

42:12.225 --> 42:14.967
America will squash him
like a june bug.

42:15.097 --> 42:17.796
Deployment of Stormcloud would
be the worst atrocity committed

42:17.926 --> 42:19.101
since World War II.
We're talking

42:19.232 --> 42:20.929
about hundreds
of thousands dead.

42:21.060 --> 42:22.931
Well,
that's a worst-case scenario.

42:23.062 --> 42:25.325
Unbalanced Harwood may be,
but he can't pull the trigger

42:25.455 --> 42:27.283
without the support
of the Army general staff.

42:27.414 --> 42:29.547
And they'd never agree
to such madness.

42:29.677 --> 42:33.115
All we can do right now
is pass along the intel

42:33.246 --> 42:35.553
-with a big red flag on it.
-[scoffs]

42:37.467 --> 42:39.034
A red flag?

42:39.165 --> 42:42.081
We supply the data,

42:42.211 --> 42:43.299
and Washington
makes the decision.

42:43.430 --> 42:45.780
And they'll do the right thing.

42:45.911 --> 42:47.869
America won't stand still
for a mass murder.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.306
I saw Stormcloud.

42:50.437 --> 42:53.962
I helped test it.
I saw people dying in agony,

42:54.093 --> 42:55.964
and I had to stand there
and do nothing

42:56.095 --> 42:57.705
with a goddamn clipboard
in my hand.

42:57.836 --> 42:59.098
If...

42:59.228 --> 43:02.231
If our government doesn't act...

43:04.190 --> 43:06.105
I damn sure will.

43:07.367 --> 43:08.586
And what will you do?

43:14.940 --> 43:17.812
You're CIA station chief.

43:17.943 --> 43:19.597
What will youdo?

43:30.303 --> 43:32.392
[panting]

43:32.522 --> 43:34.612
Hello?

43:35.525 --> 43:38.006
Hello?

43:40.574 --> 43:42.924
[echoes]:
Crowley?

43:44.099 --> 43:45.274
Crowley!

43:52.325 --> 43:54.893
I'm not scared!

43:57.460 --> 44:00.420
[laughs]
You drugged me!

44:00.550 --> 44:03.379
Well done!

44:03.510 --> 44:07.819
You're just making it worse
for yourself when I catch you.

44:07.949 --> 44:09.777
Do you hear me?!

44:09.908 --> 44:11.953
-Crowley!
-MAN: John.

44:17.263 --> 44:19.395
John...

44:20.483 --> 44:22.050
[panting]

44:22.181 --> 44:25.010
[grunts]

44:25.140 --> 44:27.665
What? What the...?

44:29.623 --> 44:31.712
[grunting, gasping]

44:33.540 --> 44:34.802
[cries out]

44:34.933 --> 44:35.977
[whispers]:
Oh, my God.

44:36.108 --> 44:37.979
[panting]

44:38.110 --> 44:41.461
[screaming]

44:41.591 --> 44:42.984
QUEEN:
Mr. Ripper?

44:43.115 --> 44:45.465
Mr. Ripper.

44:45.595 --> 44:47.685
Mr. Ripper, what's the meaning
of this behavior?

44:50.339 --> 44:52.037
What's wrong with him?

44:52.167 --> 44:53.952
Dear me, I don't know.

44:54.082 --> 44:55.693
Help me.

44:55.823 --> 44:57.303
He's had some kind
of nervous breakdown.

44:57.433 --> 44:58.826
Perhaps we should call a doctor.

44:58.957 --> 45:00.088
Yes.

45:00.219 --> 45:03.265
He's been under a lot of stress.

45:03.396 --> 45:07.400
A long rest in Bedlam will do
him a power of good, poor chap.

45:07.530 --> 45:09.532
Why? Why is this happening?

45:09.663 --> 45:12.318
[Ripper groans, exhales]

45:12.448 --> 45:14.755
[whimpering]

45:14.886 --> 45:16.844
[panting]

45:18.977 --> 45:21.196
[panting]

45:21.327 --> 45:23.242
[gasps]

45:23.372 --> 45:26.158
It was me, old friend.

45:26.288 --> 45:28.334
I did this to you.

45:28.464 --> 45:30.728
[gasps]

45:34.644 --> 45:36.298
[groans]

45:36.429 --> 45:38.997
[both growling]

45:40.433 --> 45:43.436
[yelling]

45:43.566 --> 45:46.308
[whimpering and groaning]

45:46.439 --> 45:50.051
No! No! No! No, no!

45:50.182 --> 45:52.053
[yelling]

45:52.184 --> 45:55.404
[whimpering]

45:55.535 --> 45:57.624
[indistinct crowd chatter]

45:57.755 --> 46:01.410
[Daveboy] Another day,
another fucking massacre.

46:01.541 --> 46:02.977
I need a drink.

46:03.108 --> 46:04.457
Juice? Whiskey, please.

46:04.587 --> 46:06.241
BARTENDER:
Coming up.

46:06.372 --> 46:10.071
I tried, didn't I?
I tried to do things peaceful.

46:10.202 --> 46:14.423
Well, I hope America's
worth all this shite.

46:14.554 --> 46:17.122
How many people have died
to get us there?

46:17.252 --> 46:20.125
-Mm.
-I want a word with you.

46:20.255 --> 46:22.954
All right, Sid.
Look, I know Sandra's upset.

46:23.084 --> 46:24.607
Don't you even mention her name.

46:24.738 --> 46:26.000
My Sandra's too good
for a dosser like you.

46:26.131 --> 46:27.175
Yes, she is, yeah.

46:27.306 --> 46:28.524
She hasn't stopped crying.

46:28.655 --> 46:30.483
-Look, I'm sorry. I am.
-Yeah.

46:30.613 --> 46:31.658
Full of remorse, ain't ya?

46:31.789 --> 46:33.529
Real gentleman you are.

46:33.660 --> 46:35.662
Why don't you sod off
to America, you cunt?

46:35.793 --> 46:38.534
-Good riddance.
-[sighs]

46:38.665 --> 46:40.362
[sniffles]

46:40.493 --> 46:43.148
-[crowd chatter]
-[piano music playing]

46:43.278 --> 46:44.714
You had that coming.

46:44.845 --> 46:47.369
-Fuck off, Daveboy.
-Fuck off, yourself.

46:47.500 --> 46:49.284
I'm sick and bloody tired

46:49.415 --> 46:51.112
of everyone blaming me
for everything, all right?

46:51.243 --> 46:52.897
I'm just trying to make
something of myself, that's all.

46:53.027 --> 46:54.724
Oh, aye, well,

46:54.855 --> 46:56.988
you've made something
of yourself, that's for sure.

46:57.118 --> 46:59.338
-Shut it!
-Oh, aye?

46:59.468 --> 47:02.515
Or else what, eh? Hey?

47:02.645 --> 47:04.517
Fuck off and get drunk.

47:04.647 --> 47:06.214
Leave me alone.

47:06.345 --> 47:07.955
Aye.

47:10.740 --> 47:12.351
-Fucking move.
-WOMAN: Oh! [laughs]

47:21.577 --> 47:23.971
[sniffles, sighs]

47:46.646 --> 47:47.995
Bad day, was it?

47:52.391 --> 47:54.523
Had worse.

47:55.655 --> 47:57.700
Where's your hanky?

47:57.831 --> 47:59.137
Ain't got one.

47:59.267 --> 48:00.703
[sighs]

48:00.834 --> 48:04.620
How many times
have I told you?

48:04.751 --> 48:06.144
Always have
a clean hanky with you.

48:06.274 --> 48:07.754
-[sniffles]
-Not like that.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.408
You'll make the bleeding worse.

48:11.758 --> 48:13.499
[sniffles]

48:16.806 --> 48:18.765
[sighs]

48:18.896 --> 48:21.159
Remember your first bloody nose?

48:21.289 --> 48:25.293
Marjorie Pimm,
the milkie's daughter.

48:26.860 --> 48:28.731
You tried to kiss her.

48:28.862 --> 48:31.909
Gave me a right kicking.

48:32.039 --> 48:35.086
You've not been far
from trouble ever since.

48:35.216 --> 48:37.349
I've tried.

48:37.479 --> 48:40.918
You've tried,
but not hard enough.

48:41.048 --> 48:44.530
There's something
about trouble that you like.

48:44.660 --> 48:47.446
I'm sorry, Mum, for everything.

48:47.576 --> 48:50.405
Oh, I know you are.

48:50.536 --> 48:52.320
That's my only consolation.

48:52.451 --> 48:55.062
I know you're ashamed
of yourself.

48:57.891 --> 48:59.371
I don't know what to do
with you anymore.

48:59.501 --> 49:00.720
Mum...

49:00.850 --> 49:02.548
Shh.

49:02.678 --> 49:04.593
Your dad would like me
to look after you,

49:04.724 --> 49:07.466
keep you out of mischief.

49:07.596 --> 49:10.556
How can I do that if
you're thousands of miles away?

49:10.686 --> 49:12.123
[sighs] I can't.

49:12.253 --> 49:14.386
You can't.

49:17.084 --> 49:20.696
So... I will come with you
to bloody America,

49:20.827 --> 49:22.437
on one condition.

49:22.568 --> 49:24.135
What's that, then?

49:24.265 --> 49:26.528
No guns, no violence,

49:26.659 --> 49:29.096
and you'll give me
some grandchildren.

49:29.227 --> 49:31.664
That's three conditions.

49:31.794 --> 49:34.536
And we can't live anywhere
near their bears or wolves.

49:34.667 --> 49:36.321
Or snakes.

49:36.451 --> 49:38.105
Promise.
