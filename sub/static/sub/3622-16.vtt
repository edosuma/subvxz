WEBVTT

00:05.238 --> 00:08.007
KIM:
Good morning. Oh. Excuse me.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.208
Sorry.
Kimbo!

00:09.210 --> 00:11.677
Hey, Ron. Can't stop.
Way busy. Kim,

00:11.679 --> 00:13.212
you <i>do</i> have the
new routine ready

00:13.214 --> 00:14.813
for practice this afternoon?

00:14.815 --> 00:17.683
Oh, it'll be ready.
Will you?

00:17.685 --> 00:18.984
Hm!

00:18.986 --> 00:21.587
GIRL: Miss Possible, ( <i>laughing</i>)

00:21.589 --> 00:23.655
the Environmental Action Club
thanks you

00:23.657 --> 00:26.025
for organizing the cleanup
of Middleton Park.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.260
No big.
It'll be beyond spotless.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.129
Hey!
Support, please, Kim.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.064
As chair of
the Planning Committee

00:32.066 --> 00:34.299
for the Mad Dog Ball,
are we on track?

00:34.301 --> 00:36.301
Tell the Student Council
that the chair promises

00:36.303 --> 00:37.736
this dance will rock out.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.071
BONNIE:
Oh, really?

00:39.073 --> 00:41.006
Maybe Kim's not
right for the job.

00:41.008 --> 00:42.808
Maybe there's someone better.

00:42.810 --> 00:46.945
Someone who just met Smash
Mouth's personal trainer.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.948
You know someone who met Smash
Mouth's personal trainer?

00:49.950 --> 00:51.583
Me!

00:51.585 --> 00:53.552
Nice try, Bonnie,
but I've got everything

00:53.554 --> 00:55.721
( <i>beeping</i>) under control.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.656
Whoa!

00:57.658 --> 00:59.024
Whoa!
Hey, watch it!

00:59.026 --> 00:59.992
Watch out!

00:59.994 --> 01:01.760
( <i>gasps</i> )

01:05.799 --> 01:07.066
What's the sitch, Wade?

01:07.068 --> 01:07.966
Bad time?

01:07.968 --> 01:10.602
Ferociously.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.072
Oh, yes...
this is what I call totally

01:13.074 --> 01:15.307

02:21.876 --> 02:23.041
Kim, Kim, Kim.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.776
Kim, Kim, Kim.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.812
Maybe it's time to cut back
on the extracurrics.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.380
Don't have to.
I can do it all.

02:28.382 --> 02:31.316
Why not be more like me...
relaxed, laid-back.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.818
An uninvolved sloth?

02:32.820 --> 02:34.820
Don't slam the sloth...
did you know the sloth

02:34.822 --> 02:36.321
only goes to the bathroom
once a week?

02:36.323 --> 02:38.657
Any more fun sloth facts?

02:38.659 --> 02:39.658
Um.. nope.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.059
No, that's pretty much it.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.828
No, wait,
they sleep upside down.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.696
Moving on...

02:44.698 --> 02:46.198
You're stressed, K.P.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.034
What's the big bad about
Bonnie chairing the dance?

02:49.036 --> 02:50.836
Bonnie in charge?

02:50.838 --> 02:54.039
Oh, she wouldn't settle
for chair, she'd want throne.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.374
No. If I stick
to my schedule

02:55.376 --> 02:57.809
and no mission comes up,
I'll be golden.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.978
WOMAN: <i>It's going to
be a little loud now.</i>

02:59.980 --> 03:02.014
Here on our production floor,

03:02.016 --> 03:04.449
we make our best-selling
Britina dolls,

03:04.451 --> 03:06.919
each one mass-produced
with love,

03:06.921 --> 03:09.922
thanks to the most powerful
engine in the industry.

03:12.892 --> 03:14.893
WOMAN:
I see we have

03:14.895 --> 03:16.795
some stragglers.

03:18.798 --> 03:20.032
( <i>explosion</i> )

03:20.034 --> 03:21.900
( <i>yelling and gasping</i>)

03:21.902 --> 03:23.268
The engine!

03:23.270 --> 03:25.237
( <i>echoing</i> ):
Where's the engine?!

03:25.239 --> 03:27.239
Shh.
Oh, sorry.

03:27.241 --> 03:29.341
MOTHER:
Kimmie, breakfast!

03:29.343 --> 03:31.176
Morning, Mom. Got to go.
Oh, no.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.411
You're not running out

03:32.413 --> 03:34.379
without eating first. No time.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.481
I'm sure whatever villain
you plan to vanquish

03:36.483 --> 03:38.417
can wait until you've had
a balanced breakfast.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.118
Not a bad guy thing, Mom.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.821
I've just got another
way busy day schedged.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.857
If you ask me, kids today
are way over-schedged.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.860
<i>Dad,</i> didn't we agree
on no life lessons at breakfast?

03:48.862 --> 03:51.296
Back in my day,
we had time to just be kids.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.065
Ah, those lazy afternoons

03:53.067 --> 03:55.400
pretending to be
prize-winning scientists,

03:55.402 --> 03:57.436
mixing up batches
of rocket fuel,

03:57.438 --> 04:00.138
launching the family
station wagon into orbit.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.274
Let's not talk about that
around Jim and Tim.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.376
( <i>beeping</i> ) What up, Wade?

04:04.378 --> 04:06.445
Hit on your Web site...
a little girl named Midge

04:06.447 --> 04:08.380
has been saving up
for a new Britina doll,

04:08.382 --> 04:09.815
but the store ran out.

04:09.817 --> 04:11.984
I don't mean
to sound Scroogey, Wade,

04:11.986 --> 04:14.386
but one girl, one doll...
can't it wait?

04:14.388 --> 04:16.488
Try thousands of girls
and no dolls.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.457
There's a nationwide shortage.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.926
Okay. I'm on it.

04:20.928 --> 04:25.497
GIRLS ( <i>chanting</i> ): We want Britina!
We want Britina!

04:25.499 --> 04:29.001
Try to be understanding,
you cute, cute little girls.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.269
We want Britina!

04:30.271 --> 04:33.905
I don't have any!

04:33.907 --> 04:35.307
We want Britina!

04:35.309 --> 04:36.942
I think you missed one.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.211
( <i>gasps</i>) You're holding out.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.282
How long has this
been going on?

04:43.284 --> 04:46.018
Since someone stole
the assembly line.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.519
They shut down the factory.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.288
( <i>sobbing</i> )

04:49.290 --> 04:51.556
Um, is that your car out there?

04:51.558 --> 04:54.026
Wade, about the Britina dolls.
There was...

04:54.028 --> 04:55.560
Engine theft at the factory.

04:55.562 --> 04:57.296
I see. Hmm.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.530
It gets weird.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.333
Oh, great.
I don't have time for weird.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.601
The thieves
literally disappeared

05:02.603 --> 05:03.969
from the factory
with the engine.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.072
They're writing something
in finger paint.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.407
Oh, is that how that's spelled?

05:08.409 --> 05:10.809
Just like last week's
conveyor belt heist in Spain?

05:10.811 --> 05:13.445
Could be somebody's building
their own assembly line.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.213
Are you sure you don't have
one Britina left?

05:15.215 --> 05:16.882
You know, maybe
in back somewhere?

05:16.884 --> 05:19.451
KIM: Ron! It's for little Midge!

05:19.453 --> 05:21.320
Come on,
I've got the park cleanup.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.555
You rally the decorating
troops at the gym.

05:23.557 --> 05:24.890
GIRLS:
We want Britina!

05:24.892 --> 05:27.125
Whoa!

05:29.162 --> 05:31.196
Looks like the dance
is on the bottom

05:31.198 --> 05:32.297
of Kim's low-pri list.

05:32.299 --> 05:33.398
Luckily,

05:33.400 --> 05:35.067
I've got the whole
thing worked out.

05:35.069 --> 05:38.370
Kim will be here soon.
Yeah, I'm sure.

05:38.372 --> 05:41.340
And she has a very good plan,
I'll... just bet.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.541
Not sure that look

05:42.543 --> 05:44.476
is working for you, K.P.

05:44.478 --> 05:47.579
I didn't have time to find
people for the park cleanup.

05:47.581 --> 05:50.115
Yeah, just one more benefit
of not volunteering...

05:50.117 --> 05:52.150
you stay clean
and fresh-smelling.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.418
BONNIE:
Your decorations?

05:53.420 --> 05:55.287
I didn't know recycling
was the theme.

05:55.289 --> 05:56.588
Hilarious, Bonnie.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.390
I've come up with a design
that'll make the gym

05:58.392 --> 06:00.525
look perfect for the dance.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.028
Well, I haven't
actually had time

06:03.030 --> 06:06.465
to put it on paper yet,
but it's all up here.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.166
( <i>beeping</i> )
Oh, hold that thought.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.602
Wade, can't the sitch sit?

06:10.604 --> 06:12.104
You got a hit
from a brand-new

06:12.106 --> 06:13.638
mannequin factory in Sweden.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.441
It boasts a state-of-the-art,
central control unit

06:16.443 --> 06:18.043
that can process
a dummy a minute.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.344
Sounds like a sweet target

06:19.346 --> 06:21.179
for the disappearing thieves...
but this is

06:21.181 --> 06:23.181
a delicate time.

06:23.183 --> 06:26.885
Your call. ( <i>groans</i> ): Okay.
We're on our way.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.955
Um, sorry, you guys,
but I have to go.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.557
So you made no plan,
and now you're leaving?

06:32.559 --> 06:35.360
Remind us again...
you're the chair why?

06:35.362 --> 06:37.429
Trust me,
I'll be back in a flash.

06:37.431 --> 06:40.031
Right. I might fill the time
running down <i>my</i> plan.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.500
Buh-bye, Kim.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.568
You go right ahead
with your important business

06:43.570 --> 06:45.003
at the dummy factory.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.238
Let's go.
Wha... Hey!

06:46.240 --> 06:48.974
KIM:
Ooh, that Bonnie!

06:48.976 --> 06:51.209
She is the bossiest person
on the planet.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.477
Bold statement, K.P.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.079
It's a big planet.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.547
And I've been all around it,

06:55.549 --> 06:58.583
but I've never found a more
controlling, devious, bossy...

06:58.585 --> 06:59.985
Ms. Possible.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.253
Thank you for
coming so quickly.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.721
No big... it was a half day.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.957
Is it just me, or are these
mannequins good-looking?

07:05.959 --> 07:07.259
Nice!

07:07.261 --> 07:12.097
we cannot afford to take chances
with the central control unit.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.532
It runs the entire factory.

07:13.534 --> 07:16.368
Don't worry, sir, if the
thieves show, we'll get them.

07:16.370 --> 07:17.636
Yeah. There hasn't been
a thief yet

07:17.638 --> 07:19.604
that can defeat
the Stoppable Knot Maneuver.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.072
The what maneuver?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.674
This baby's not going anywhere.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.176
Uh-uh!

07:25.178 --> 07:26.545
That didn't take long.

07:27.980 --> 07:29.047
Where'd they go?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.615
Hey! Did I miss something?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.384
We all missed something.

07:32.386 --> 07:33.585
Huh?

07:37.990 --> 07:39.591
Boiled in a dummy factory.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.026
This doesn't look good.

07:51.237 --> 07:54.105
Kim, this just isn't working.

07:54.107 --> 07:57.108
( <i>grunting</i> ):
Gross!

07:57.110 --> 07:58.343
Try, you guys.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.378
That Sweden trip
torched my schedule.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.646
And what about the dance?

08:01.648 --> 08:02.814
Maybe just leave it to...

08:02.816 --> 08:05.183
Don't even say the "B" word.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.085
If I could just cover
more ground faster...

08:07.087 --> 08:09.054
Or you could just learn
to say no.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.655
I'm not programmed
that way, Ron.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.190
Really, it's not that hard.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.559
Try it with me now.
Okay, ready? No...!

08:14.561 --> 08:16.328
No...!

08:16.330 --> 08:18.763
( <i>beeping</i> ) Go, Wade.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.032
Kim, those Swedish
security tapes will reveal it.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.167
Take a look.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.568
See?

08:25.338 --> 08:28.006
The thieves appear,
seem to vanish,

08:28.008 --> 08:30.408
and then the CCU is gone.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.444
Uh, don't need
the instant replay. Lived it.

08:32.446 --> 08:35.146
Right. But you lived it
at normal speed.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.082
Watch in extra-super-slo-mo.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.685
KIM:
Wade, freeze it there.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.620
Do we know them?

08:41.622 --> 08:43.455
KIM:
It's the Bebe robots.

08:43.457 --> 08:44.623
They disappeared.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.224
It seemed like it,
but, in fact,

08:46.226 --> 08:48.193
they accelerated
to such an incredible speed,

08:48.195 --> 08:49.261
they couldn't be seen.

08:49.263 --> 08:51.263
In the time it took you
to blink,

08:51.265 --> 08:53.465
they had you wrapped up tight.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.534
And they're not just fast,
they're strong, too.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.668
That CCU is heavy,

08:56.670 --> 08:58.503
but they picked it up
and walked off.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.272
Wait, didn't you
kick their cans?

09:00.274 --> 09:01.540
So I thought.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.450
( <i>Swedish accent</i> ): The Bebe
assembly line is almost perfected.

09:12.452 --> 09:14.686
The Bebe's hive mind will grow.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.088
The only one
to defeat Bebes is...

09:17.090 --> 09:19.124
Kim Possible.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.492
Ooh, that Bonnie!

09:20.494 --> 09:23.094
She is the bossiest person
on the planet.

09:23.096 --> 09:26.264
A queen. Bebes need queen.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.533
We must seek out
this one called Bonnie.

09:28.535 --> 09:30.769
Yeah. Freddie,
can you get Smash Mouth?

09:30.771 --> 09:33.438
No?! Wh...

09:36.842 --> 09:39.844
ANNOUNCER: Hello, and welcome
to an exciting introduction

09:39.846 --> 09:42.280
to the world of honeybees.
( <i>snoring</i> )

09:42.282 --> 09:44.115
Whatever they're planning,

09:44.117 --> 09:46.484
those Bebes got a
serious speed upgrade.

09:46.486 --> 09:48.386
I'm going to need
help to keep up.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.222
A hive is a city for bees.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.326
Bees reproduce in the hive.
( <i>beeping</i> )

09:54.328 --> 09:55.427
I might have an idea.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.728
Can you meet me after school?

09:56.730 --> 09:58.396
Meet Wade?!

09:58.398 --> 10:00.265
enterprise is run by the queen,

10:00.267 --> 10:02.233
who is selected by the workers.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.435
Ron! Are you
watching this?

10:03.437 --> 10:04.836
Just barely.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.138
The production values
are way below <i>Ghost Car.</i>

10:07.140 --> 10:09.140
RON:
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

10:09.142 --> 10:10.342
KIM:
<i>Believe it.</i>

10:10.344 --> 10:11.676
The Bebes are building

10:11.678 --> 10:13.645
some kind of hive,
and they need a queen.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.247
No. That we finally get
to meet Wade in the flesh!

10:16.249 --> 10:17.482
Oh, don't hold your breath.

10:17.484 --> 10:19.217
Every time
I'm supposed to see him,

10:19.219 --> 10:20.352
he bails at the last minute.

10:20.354 --> 10:21.720
This one's Wade's.

10:22.855 --> 10:24.222
So, where is he?

10:24.224 --> 10:25.857
Over here, Ron.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.493
Oh, man! I thought this
was going to be historic.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.761
It'll happen someday.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.396
Sorry.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.164
I'm grounded
for hacking into Mom's recipes

10:33.166 --> 10:35.634
and deleting all references
to broccoli.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.435
What's up?
Follow me.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.574
I've been doing some consulting
work on movement dynamics.

10:50.716 --> 10:54.319
( <i>squeaking</i> )

10:54.321 --> 10:56.755
Uh, Wade?
It's a rat... in a maze.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.390
Yeah, a slow rat.

10:58.392 --> 10:59.858
Right.
This is the control group

10:59.860 --> 11:01.626
without speed enhancement.

11:05.931 --> 11:07.165
( <i>bell dings</i> )

11:07.167 --> 11:09.834
Mm, cheese.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.337
Way to be, Rufus.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.572
And now
the experimental subject.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.210
( <i>bell dings</i> ) Whoa!

11:19.212 --> 11:21.513
RON:
That is one speedy rodent.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.714
( <i>gasps</i> )

11:24.383 --> 11:26.351
( <i>bell dings</i> )

11:26.919 --> 11:28.186
( <i>bell dings</i> )

11:28.188 --> 11:29.387
( <i>growls</i> )

11:29.389 --> 11:31.322
WADE:
The Valkyrie-1000's

11:31.324 --> 11:34.459
hyper-accelerate the kinetic
movements of living organisms.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.528
Right, right.
Obviously.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.896
Yeah, what's that mean?

11:37.898 --> 11:39.631
They make you go fast.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.434
I don't suppose you have those
in a size seven?

11:43.836 --> 11:45.637
It's the only human pair.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.739
And we haven't finished testing yet.
No time.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.974
They're my best hope of catching
the speedy Bebes.

11:49.976 --> 11:52.811
Maybe. But don't wear them
any more than necessary.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.647
We don't understand all the effects
the shoes will have. Got it.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.685
Hey! Gimme.

12:05.524 --> 12:07.592
( <i>groans</i> )

12:22.541 --> 12:24.242
FATHER:
Kimmie!

12:24.244 --> 12:25.543
Hang on.

12:33.285 --> 12:35.754
Oh, yeah,
this I could get used to.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.422
Honey, you need
a ride to school?

12:37.424 --> 12:38.990
No, thanks, Dad.
Got it covered.

12:45.831 --> 12:47.265
Kim!

12:47.267 --> 12:49.367
( <i>yells</i> )

12:58.310 --> 13:00.044
All done.
Uh, K.P.,

13:00.046 --> 13:01.746
you're wearing the super shoes.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.381
And you think I shouldn't
be taking the risk.

13:03.383 --> 13:04.415
That's sweet.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.683
Actually, I was thinking

13:05.685 --> 13:07.919
you could zip out
to St. Louis for ribs.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.487
Mm-hmm, and fries.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.623
Come on, we've got
a schedule to keep.

13:14.493 --> 13:15.860
You hang, I'll decorate.

13:23.669 --> 13:24.903
( <i>stammering</i> )

13:24.905 --> 13:25.904
Huh?

13:25.906 --> 13:26.905
All done.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.306
No big.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.641
( <i>beep</i>) What up, Wade?

13:29.643 --> 13:30.975
Got the 411 on the Bebes,

13:30.977 --> 13:32.577
like, where they might be
building their factory?

13:32.579 --> 13:33.912
'Cause if you know the where,
I am there.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.347
You've been wearing the shoes?

13:36.349 --> 13:37.782
( <i>chuckles</i> ):
Maybe a little.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.384
Could be time to use them.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.753
A satellite scan shows a
structure that suddenly appeared

13:41.755 --> 13:44.322
on an island off the Gulf Coast.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.089
Super speed construction?

13:45.091 --> 13:47.525
Let's jet.
( <i>screams</i> )

13:50.329 --> 13:51.763
Thanks for the lift, Joe.

13:51.765 --> 13:56.901
( <i>slowly</i> ): It's the
least I can do.

13:56.903 --> 13:57.836
You all right, Joe?

13:57.838 --> 13:59.737
Joe?

13:59.739 --> 14:00.705
Ron?

14:00.707 --> 14:02.674
Something's happened to...

14:02.676 --> 14:04.709
me.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.744
I'm moving at
hyper-speed.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.346
( <i>grunts</i> )

14:08.348 --> 14:09.514
Oh. Uh-oh.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.550
Come on.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.557
Wade, the shoes are stuck.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.993
I'm moving so fast,
time is standing still.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.528
Ron can't even hear me.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.131
And you can't either.
Great.

14:27.133 --> 14:29.567
I could walk there
faster than this.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.069
( <i>gasps</i> )

14:35.541 --> 14:36.875
It's the least I can
do, Ms. Possible,

14:36.877 --> 14:37.876
after the way...

14:37.878 --> 14:39.811
Hey! Kim's gone.

14:39.813 --> 14:40.912
Gone where?

14:40.914 --> 14:42.547
We're in the air over the ocean.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.782
Uh, what's that on your shirt?

14:46.452 --> 14:50.088
"Ron, moving at hyper-speed.
Went ahead. Kim."

14:50.090 --> 14:51.522
Huh. Must be the shoes.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.563
This must be the place.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.232
Bebe 16 accessing hive.

15:09.975 --> 15:11.876
Bonnie?

15:11.878 --> 15:13.444
Kim Possible.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.547
You are so done for.

15:23.989 --> 15:25.690
Target: Kim Possible.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.726
Level of threat:
totally less than minimal.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.930
Bonnie is your queen?!

15:31.932 --> 15:32.864
Thanks to you, Kim.

15:32.866 --> 15:34.632
Me?! How?

15:34.634 --> 15:37.802
You identified Bonnie
as the bossiest on the planet.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.604
Perfect for our queen.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.205
( <i>scoffs</i> ):
Swell.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.841
The Bebe hive mind
is so Bonnie.

15:43.843 --> 15:45.610
Bonnie rules.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.111
Okay. Enough.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.547
A hypersonic emission
got you last time.

15:56.021 --> 15:57.522
I don't think so.

16:00.025 --> 16:01.592
Hey!

16:04.096 --> 16:06.464
So sorry, Kim.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.700
Fool me twice and all that.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.134
Oh, it's not over yet.

16:10.136 --> 16:12.770
I'm shutting you down
and going to that dance.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.739
Wearing that?
How tacky.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.040
I have a dress.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.576
No doubt tackier still.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.211
Resuming mass production.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.715
Bebe 19, Bebe 20, Bebe 21,

16:23.717 --> 16:25.516
Bebe 22, Bebe 23...

16:32.491 --> 16:33.891
Give it up, Kim.

16:33.893 --> 16:36.127
Soon there'll be
an army of Bebes.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.563
And our queen Bonnie
will be perfect

16:38.565 --> 16:40.631
and take over your species.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.969
We're coming, K.P.!

16:46.138 --> 16:47.739
Ron...

16:47.741 --> 16:50.641
You can't even see me.

Kim?

16:53.513 --> 16:54.679
Are you here?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.114
They let you out of
the dummy factory?

16:56.116 --> 16:58.149
Bonnie?!
You're their queen?

16:58.151 --> 16:59.851
This is so totally Kim's fault.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.185
Where is she?

17:01.187 --> 17:03.688
She's moving at hyper-speed,
just like the Bebes.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.723
Ugh! Why does she get to be
invisible?

17:05.725 --> 17:07.625
Is she gonna
lord that over me, too?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.560
Not invisible.
Moving too fast to see.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.695
She's got new shoes.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.796
Whatever.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.598

Yes, defying gravity does rock.

in that thing?

Hello?
I wish I knew.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.608
These freaky chicks grabbed me.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.176
When I ordered them
to put me down,

17:25.178 --> 17:26.911
they just said, "Bonnie rules."

17:26.913 --> 17:29.013
Which, you know,
I had to agree with.

17:29.015 --> 17:31.849
Nice going. Just crack this
thing open and get me out.

17:33.052 --> 17:34.185

Smooth move.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.088
You did that on purpose!

17:37.090 --> 17:38.956
I'm not doing anything.

17:38.958 --> 17:42.160
They said the hive mind taps
directly into my subconscious.

BEBE:
Target: Smash Mouth.

17:44.831 --> 17:49.667
Bebe Nine obeying Queen Bonnie's
subconscious command.

18:02.781 --> 18:05.316
Run! Run like the wind,
little mole rat.

18:20.599 --> 18:23.101
Give her a ride
on the conveyor belt.

I would really rather not
get Bebe-fied.

Hi.

that hairless freak.

Wrong, Kim.

19:22.095 --> 19:24.428
The hive cannot be defeated.

19:24.430 --> 19:27.165
The hive is perfect.

Not exactly
what I'd call perfection.

What are you talking about?

No!

20:05.705 --> 20:07.905
Kim, this is all your fault.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.808
You're probably talking
too slow for her to hear you.

20:10.810 --> 20:11.809
What about you?

20:11.811 --> 20:12.777
Me, too.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.946
I guess I have to let her out.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.919
Bonnie, Kim must have
set you free.

Finally.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.989
And that's it?
She got me into this.
