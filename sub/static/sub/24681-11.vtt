00:06.687 --> 00:09.019
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:09.289 --> 00:11.382
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:11.458 --> 00:14.188
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:14.361 --> 00:16.056
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:19.433 --> 00:20.957
Brad, do I make you happy?

00:21.034 --> 00:23.127
Yes, very happy.

00:27.741 --> 00:29.106
Bye.
Bye.

00:32.679 --> 00:35.739
Brad gave her a key so
she can let herself in,

00:35.949 --> 00:38.383
so she'll be here
when we get home.

00:39.653 --> 00:42.144
You're getting crumbs
on the floor.

00:42.255 --> 00:44.723
She's coming from Milwaukee,
not Buckingham Palace.

00:44.791 --> 00:47.589
Jared, in two months
Allison will be family.

00:47.828 --> 00:51.195
If she wants to be family, she
and Brad should move back here.

00:53.166 --> 00:55.999
Finish your breakfast.
We have a busy day.

01:02.476 --> 01:04.102
We want to do our
honeymoon in Bali,

01:04.177 --> 01:06.873
but the travel agent said it's
worth stopping in Singapore.

01:06.947 --> 01:08.244
Oh, the food is
so good there,

01:08.315 --> 01:11.546
and that's
a really nice hotel.

01:11.618 --> 01:13.381
Is it better to take
a livery cab to Brooklyn?

01:13.453 --> 01:14.886
A friend said
it's less expensive.

01:14.955 --> 01:16.582
We always take a hotel van.

01:16.656 --> 01:19.750
Let me get you a refill. Sir,
can I get you something to drink?

01:23.597 --> 01:25.394
The livery drivers
are thieves.

01:26.133 --> 01:28.397
Take a cab,
but watch the meter.

01:28.468 --> 01:29.833
Depending where in
Brooklyn you're going,

01:29.903 --> 01:31.234
you shouldn't pay
more than 30 bucks.

01:31.304 --> 01:32.635
Thank you.

01:33.140 --> 01:35.370
Your honeymoon,
that's when you splurge.

01:37.010 --> 01:38.910
829.

01:41.081 --> 01:42.412
Milwaukee.

01:44.317 --> 01:45.682
JFK.

01:46.753 --> 01:47.845
Can you zip me?

01:47.921 --> 01:48.979
It's on time.

01:53.393 --> 01:57.523
I've never been nervous about
anything, but I'm nervous about this.

02:01.168 --> 02:02.931
We still got
an hour to relax.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.978 --> 02:13.275
He went the wrong way,
sweetie.

02:13.346 --> 02:14.938
Didn't you tell him
to take Shore Parkway?

02:15.015 --> 02:17.483
<i>Somebody told me
the expressway was faster.</i>

02:17.551 --> 02:18.950
<i>Oh, we just crossed Bay Ridge.</i>

02:19.019 --> 02:21.180
Okay. On 73rd, turn left.

02:21.254 --> 02:22.744
It's the third house
on the right.

02:23.023 --> 02:25.491
<i>I think I can
see it from here.</i>

02:25.559 --> 02:27.424
<i>I have to go. I love you.</i>

02:27.494 --> 02:29.325
I love you too, sweetie.

02:33.733 --> 02:34.893
<i>Are you sure?</i>

02:35.368 --> 02:38.132
Mom, she was right in front of
the house when I talked to her.

02:38.205 --> 02:39.695
That was five hours ago.

02:40.774 --> 02:42.674
Hang on, I'm trying
her cell again.

02:47.214 --> 02:50.615
Yo, the trash is calling.
Must be one of your hoochies.

02:50.684 --> 02:52.709
Just 'cause you
ain't got none...

02:53.286 --> 02:55.982
Oh, damn!
Yo, check this out.

03:45.739 --> 03:48.970
It was in her pocket. It kept
ringing, so we fished it out.

03:49.042 --> 03:50.873
It was her fiancÃ©
calling from Milwaukee.

03:50.944 --> 03:53.208
Poor guy.
Where's he now?

03:53.280 --> 03:55.441
We got a unit
meeting him at JFK.

03:56.950 --> 03:59.111
You said her name
was Allison, right?

03:59.185 --> 04:01.415
Allison Jenkins, 28.

04:01.855 --> 04:04.881
Our report said a cab dropped
her off two miles from here?

04:04.958 --> 04:06.619
Narrows Avenue at 73rd.

04:06.693 --> 04:08.422
Her future
mother-in-law's place.

04:09.663 --> 04:11.858
We tracked the cab driver
through JFK dispatch.

04:11.932 --> 04:13.422
He was home asleep
when we picked him up.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.899
Did you
check his logs?

04:14.968 --> 04:16.697
He picked up another
fare on Bay Ridge Avenue,

04:16.769 --> 04:18.635
three minutes after
he dropped her off.

04:18.704 --> 04:21.196
He's probably okay, but
forensics is going over his cab.

04:21.274 --> 04:23.003
We'll want
to talk to him.

04:29.516 --> 04:31.313
She took a hit to the head.

04:31.384 --> 04:35.047
The wounds on her face,
eyes, pretty severe.

04:35.355 --> 04:37.823
But there isn't much swelling.
It's probably post-mortem.

04:37.891 --> 04:40.451
There's no obvious signs
of sexual assault.

04:41.394 --> 04:43.794
Her engagement ring
is still on her finger.

04:43.863 --> 04:47.060
No sex, no robbery. Somebody
just wanted her dead.

04:48.001 --> 04:50.026
Well, this is what
they did it with.

04:50.103 --> 04:51.934
Blood, hair stuck to it.

04:52.005 --> 04:54.599
Detectives,
this is Mr. Haidar.

04:54.674 --> 04:56.471
He drove Ms. Jenkins
to Brooklyn.

04:56.543 --> 04:58.704
Mr. Haidar, do you remember
anything unusual that happened?

04:58.778 --> 04:59.972
Maybe something she said?

05:00.046 --> 05:01.604
I took her to
Narrows Avenue.

05:01.681 --> 05:05.412
It was rush hour, but still
she made me take the expressway.

05:05.885 --> 05:07.682
You see if she made
it into the house?

05:07.754 --> 05:09.779
No. The street was
blocked off for repairs.

05:09.856 --> 05:11.585
I had to leave her
on the corner.

05:11.658 --> 05:13.387
They dug up the street?

05:13.460 --> 05:16.361
Yes. They just left it
blocked off.

05:17.163 --> 05:18.289
I'll take
his statement.

05:18.365 --> 05:19.457
Okay.

05:23.770 --> 05:26.466
The brick, the corners
are rounded off.

05:27.707 --> 05:29.265
It's a cobblestone.

05:31.211 --> 05:33.202
Matches the one
in the dumpster.

05:36.149 --> 05:37.343
Hey. How you doing?

05:37.417 --> 05:39.715
Yesterday, what time
did you guys knock off?

05:39.786 --> 05:41.310
3:00 p. m., on the dot.

05:42.255 --> 05:44.723
When you left, you blocked the whole
street off or just this one side?

05:44.791 --> 05:47.783
Just this side. We left
a lane open for traffic.

05:47.861 --> 05:49.089
Thanks.

05:50.930 --> 05:53.364
The cab driver said the
whole street was blocked off.

05:53.433 --> 05:57.392
Somebody moved those cones so Allison
would have to walk from the corner.

05:57.470 --> 06:01.372
They knew she was coming. They were
waiting for her with one of these.

06:07.180 --> 06:10.843
We were on the phone. She
said she could see the house.

06:13.987 --> 06:16.547
I told her I loved her,
but she'd already hung up.

06:18.124 --> 06:20.456
Was anyone home
waiting for Allison?

06:21.261 --> 06:23.593
No. Jared and I
were both at work.

06:23.663 --> 06:26.496
She had a key
so she could let herself in.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.560
Allison told the cab driver
to use the expressway.

06:29.636 --> 06:30.694
Was that your idea?

06:30.770 --> 06:32.761
No, I told her to
take Shore Parkway.

06:32.839 --> 06:36.206
She said somebody else told
her the expressway was quicker.

06:36.543 --> 06:38.101
What else
did she talk about?

06:38.178 --> 06:39.338
Our honeymoon.

06:41.147 --> 06:45.106
She looked at travel brochures
on the plane. Excuse me. I...

06:51.191 --> 06:55.355
What's that?
"Wycliff Pest Control. "

06:56.096 --> 06:57.154
Your business?

06:57.230 --> 06:59.391
My dad started it.
Mom runs it now.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.761
I just work there.

07:02.402 --> 07:05.428
Any reason why
your brother doesn't?

07:05.505 --> 07:06.802
He had better things to do.

07:07.507 --> 07:10.874
Did you ever think, Jared, that if
Brad had gotten married to Allison,

07:10.944 --> 07:13.003
he would've stayed
in Milwaukee for good,

07:14.013 --> 07:17.540
never come back here
to help you chase bugs?

07:18.918 --> 07:21.887
Where were you yesterday
afternoon around 5:00?

07:24.290 --> 07:25.951
I didn't hurt her.

07:26.059 --> 07:30.189
I just wanted to talk to her, tell her
that she should let Brad move back here.

07:30.830 --> 07:32.422
But she never showed up.

07:32.499 --> 07:33.989
I waited for her.
I looked outside.

07:34.067 --> 07:35.125
There was nobody, nothing,

07:35.201 --> 07:37.101
just some blue Lincoln.

07:37.604 --> 07:41.335
I figured her plane was late.
I fell asleep waiting.

07:45.645 --> 07:49.638
I'm sorry I fell asleep. I'm
sorry that I couldn't save her.

07:51.718 --> 07:53.049
So are we.

07:54.387 --> 07:57.015
Captain's getting an
earful from the Chief of Ds.

07:57.090 --> 07:59.320
Apparently, when tourists take
a bite out of the Big Apple,

07:59.392 --> 08:02.020
the Apple isn't supposed
to bite back.

08:03.396 --> 08:05.489
Somebody's already
been through this.

08:09.169 --> 08:13.071
These seams are undone.

08:13.139 --> 08:14.504
Same thing here.

08:15.708 --> 08:20.736
Here's her wallet
and cash and credit cards.

08:25.451 --> 08:27.885
Only thing that's missing
is the travel brochures.

08:29.222 --> 08:33.385
This... Cut all the linings.

08:33.827 --> 08:35.624
They were looking
for something.

08:35.695 --> 08:37.094
Maybe somebody
at their airport

08:37.163 --> 08:39.289
mistook her for a drug mule?

08:39.732 --> 08:42.860
This person was waiting for
Allison when she got out of the cab.

08:43.870 --> 08:47.067
Maybe that's who told her
to take the expressway.

08:47.473 --> 08:50.772
Slow her down, so they
could get there ahead of her.

08:51.578 --> 08:54.172
Somehow they knew
where she was going.

08:54.681 --> 08:57.912
Allison wouldn't give out
personal information to a stranger.

09:01.888 --> 09:03.617
Unless she got to know them.

09:03.690 --> 09:05.954
By sitting next to them
on the plane?

09:09.562 --> 09:12.554
<i>Ms. Jenkins was in row 47
on the aisle.</i>

09:12.632 --> 09:14.190
Next to her,
in the window seat,

09:14.267 --> 09:17.327
was a Mr. Leonard Passante.

09:17.403 --> 09:19.337
He originated in Austin.

09:19.405 --> 09:20.531
Austin?

09:20.840 --> 09:23.809
Any reason why he flew to
New York through Milwaukee?

09:23.977 --> 09:25.467
Let me check.

09:26.379 --> 09:31.840
He flew Austin to Seattle,
took a connector to Saint Louis,

09:31.918 --> 09:33.215
then to Milwaukee.

09:33.786 --> 09:36.949
Pinball special. What was he
looking for, cheap flights?

09:37.023 --> 09:39.685
Hardly. These are
all one-way tickets.

09:43.296 --> 09:44.627
Pardon me.

09:44.998 --> 09:47.466
There's a number for him.
Can I use your phone?

09:49.168 --> 09:50.760
What's that abbreviation here?

09:50.837 --> 09:54.034
He requested the window seat
in the last row of every flight.

09:54.107 --> 09:56.473
Some people are
superstitious that way.

09:58.578 --> 10:01.547
Or they just don't
like people behind them.

10:01.848 --> 10:03.941
The number's out of service.

10:06.119 --> 10:08.952
Complicated itinerary,
last-row seating.

10:09.022 --> 10:11.252
Mr. Passante's acting
like a man on the run.

10:13.660 --> 10:15.321
They're all ugly.

10:15.395 --> 10:18.558
If I gotta pay for them,
I should get to pick them out.

10:21.734 --> 10:22.792
Yeah?

10:25.638 --> 10:27.128
Yeah, okay. I'll tell her.

10:30.543 --> 10:32.340
He wants you to
put the wigs away.

10:32.412 --> 10:34.175
He's spying on us?

10:35.348 --> 10:37.543
Sonny, this is not
gonna work.

10:37.617 --> 10:38.811
It's gonna work.

10:41.721 --> 10:42.881
There.

10:43.656 --> 10:46.853
Take a good look at him.
He's our lottery ticket.

10:54.200 --> 10:59.160
Passante's described as white,
50s, average, glasses and hat.

10:59.238 --> 11:03.834
Paid cash for his ticket. The driver's
license he used for ID is bogus.

11:03.910 --> 11:06.845
The flight attendant
saw him talking to Allison.

11:06.913 --> 11:08.380
Something about her
set him off.

11:08.448 --> 11:09.915
Maybe something
in her background?

11:09.983 --> 11:12.042
Nothing there but
sugar and spice.

11:12.118 --> 11:14.916
The lab matched blue fibers on
Allison's clothes with the carpeting

11:14.988 --> 11:16.853
used in new Lincoln Town Cars.

11:16.923 --> 11:20.256
Jared Wycliff saw a blue
Lincoln parked on his street.

11:20.326 --> 11:22.521
The plane landed at 4:00.
Thank you.

11:22.695 --> 11:24.686
He would've had
to leave by 4:30

11:24.764 --> 11:27.232
to get to Bay Ridge
to wait for Allison.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.824
A half-hour window
to rent a blue car?

11:29.902 --> 11:31.369
It's worth a shot.
Start dialing.

11:33.006 --> 11:34.667
Taking some R&R?

11:34.874 --> 11:37.206
These are duplicates
of the brochures

11:37.276 --> 11:39.506
that Allison got
from the travel agent.

11:40.513 --> 11:43.812
They were the only things
missing from her personal effects.

11:45.618 --> 11:47.176
The lady needs it
back tomorrow.

11:47.253 --> 11:49.050
Tomorrow afternoon. Promise.

11:49.889 --> 11:53.757
It's Jeremy, right? I really
can't thank you enough.

11:54.594 --> 11:57.028
I should be going. I try to get
home in time to eat with the kids.

11:57.096 --> 11:58.358
That's sweet.

11:58.431 --> 12:00.991
How much do you think a cab
to New Rochelle is?

12:01.067 --> 12:03.262
Well, it's far. They'll
charge you round trip.

12:03.336 --> 12:05.167
Could be $200.

12:06.873 --> 12:08.500
Is there a train?

12:12.645 --> 12:15.773
Blue Town Car rented
to a Duncan Tamblyn,

12:15.848 --> 12:18.817
using a fake credit card and a
fake Ontario driver's license.

12:18.885 --> 12:20.682
I put out an APB.

12:20.753 --> 12:22.277
They make a copy
of the license?

12:22.355 --> 12:24.414
The picture didn't come out.

12:24.490 --> 12:26.219
Something wrong
with the copier.

12:26.292 --> 12:27.418
Maybe not.

12:27.493 --> 12:30.257
You know, you can put
epoxy on the original photo.

12:30.329 --> 12:32.797
It interferes with
the photocopy light.

12:33.699 --> 12:35.564
Well, that's a lot
of trouble to go to.

12:35.635 --> 12:38.069
This is a guy who changed
his reservation eight times

12:38.137 --> 12:39.502
to get the seat
that he wanted.

12:39.572 --> 12:42.473
His itinerary added 20
hours to his travel time.

12:43.176 --> 12:45.076
The guy works hard
to stay off the grid.

12:45.144 --> 12:47.408
These places look
way off our grid.

12:49.849 --> 12:52.841
Singapore, Bali,
Kuala Lumpur.

12:55.088 --> 12:57.113
There's a connection.
I just can't see it.

12:57.190 --> 12:58.555
Detective.

12:59.926 --> 13:02.258
The rental was abandoned
at a garage downtown.

13:02.328 --> 13:05.024
It got towed from a
parking lot the day before.

13:06.532 --> 13:08.363
Sure, I remember her.

13:08.434 --> 13:11.164
She was out here for an hour.
Beautiful girl.

13:11.838 --> 13:14.500
The tow truck driver said
there was a man helping her.

13:14.574 --> 13:16.439
Mr. Stockton. He's a lawyer.

13:16.509 --> 13:18.101
He parks his car here.

13:18.177 --> 13:19.769
He lent her his phone.

13:19.879 --> 13:23.474
You said they waited
an hour for the tow?

13:23.549 --> 13:25.016
They waited 20 minutes.

13:25.084 --> 13:28.485
She was out here for a while
before Mr. Stockton came along.

13:30.923 --> 13:33.619
Mr. Stockton get off work
same time every day?

13:33.860 --> 13:35.225
Yeah, pretty much.

13:36.662 --> 13:38.254
Did he give the girl a ride?

13:38.331 --> 13:41.129
Oh, look, I don't know.
It was my busy time.

13:41.200 --> 13:42.292
Thank you.

13:42.668 --> 13:47.002
Sounds like this girl picked out
her Good Samaritan in advance.

13:51.777 --> 13:53.745
I loaned her my phone,
that's all.

13:53.813 --> 13:55.440
I don't have
any information about her.

13:55.515 --> 13:59.679
The 20 minutes you waited for the
tow truck, you didn't talk to her?

13:59.819 --> 14:02.788
Yeah, she talked,
but I didn't pay attention.

14:02.855 --> 14:04.049
Come on, Mr. Stockton.

14:04.123 --> 14:06.387
You know, a beautiful woman
stops me in the street,

14:07.026 --> 14:08.687
I pay attention.

14:08.761 --> 14:10.058
I'm happily married.

14:10.129 --> 14:13.155
Somewhere along the line I
stopped noticing beautiful women.

14:13.966 --> 14:17.129
You specialize
in maritime law?

14:17.203 --> 14:18.431
That's pretty buttoned down.

14:18.504 --> 14:20.870
It is. And I should
get back to it.

14:20.940 --> 14:23.408
The parking lot attendant said
this woman had a couple suitcases...

14:23.476 --> 14:25.000
Sample cases of
upholstery fabric.

14:25.077 --> 14:26.567
She said she was in
from Atlanta.

14:26.646 --> 14:28.705
Well, see,
you were paying attention.

14:29.482 --> 14:33.782
Did you give the girl a ride
to her hotel or wherever?

14:34.320 --> 14:35.548
Absolutely not.

14:35.621 --> 14:39.489
Mr. Stockton, we think this
woman was waiting for you.

14:39.559 --> 14:41.151
She sat in front
of the parking lot

14:41.227 --> 14:43.821
<i>for 40 minutes
until you came along.</i>

14:45.231 --> 14:49.099
Right now you look like someone
just punched a hole in your hull.

14:53.873 --> 14:56.637
All I did was
loan her my phone.

14:56.709 --> 14:59.303
I'm sorry,
but I have work to do.

15:11.257 --> 15:15.318
We don't want to bother
Mr. Stockton again,

15:15.394 --> 15:17.021
but we forgot to
get his home number.

15:17.096 --> 15:18.324
Sure.

15:23.002 --> 15:25.095
Those numbers
are the time zones?

15:25.171 --> 15:26.229
Yes.

15:26.305 --> 15:29.069
Plus five is London.
We have many clients there.

15:29.141 --> 15:31.632
And plus 12, that's Asia?

15:31.711 --> 15:35.647
A board member from a company
he represents lives in Singapore.

15:36.082 --> 15:38.846
He sent Mr. Stockton
a thank-you gift recently.

15:39.919 --> 15:41.011
A gift from Singapore?

15:41.087 --> 15:43.988
Unfortunately, it arrived
in a million pieces.

15:44.056 --> 15:46.422
The gentleman called to say
he'd be sending something else.

15:46.492 --> 15:49.757
Something more appropriate
for a man with a family.

15:49.829 --> 15:52.389
He didn't know
Mr. Stockton was married?

15:53.065 --> 15:54.965
I think he did,
but when he called,

15:55.034 --> 15:56.865
he asked if Mr. Stockton
was still married

15:56.936 --> 15:59.404
and the ages of his children.

15:59.672 --> 16:03.130
Oh, that's not the sort of personal
information you usually give out.

16:03.209 --> 16:05.177
No, but this gentleman
seemed so sorry

16:05.244 --> 16:07.144
that his gift
had been damaged.

16:07.213 --> 16:08.544
Can we see the gift?

16:08.614 --> 16:09.672
Sure.

16:10.483 --> 16:12.178
How long ago did he call?

16:12.251 --> 16:15.414
Oh, it must be
three weeks ago, now.

16:16.756 --> 16:20.852
It's too bad.
It was a beautiful bowl.

16:21.527 --> 16:24.428
The store it was shipped from,
it's on the same street

16:24.497 --> 16:26.692
as the hotel in
Allison's brochure.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.828
Thank you.

16:29.702 --> 16:32.933
The hotel in the brochure has a
record of a call to Stockton's office

16:33.005 --> 16:36.566
from one of their guests. Guy
by the name of Roger Withers.

16:37.109 --> 16:38.974
What's all this malarkey
about a broken bowl?

16:39.045 --> 16:41.536
A ploy to get personal
information on Stockton,

16:41.614 --> 16:43.809
to see how big
a mark he was.

16:45.818 --> 16:48.946
And then they sent this damsel
in distress to seduce him?

16:49.021 --> 16:50.750
Long way to go
for a shakedown.

16:50.823 --> 16:52.950
Roger Withers, what do they
know about him in Singapore?

16:53.025 --> 16:56.859
White male, 50s, American, same
as the guy who sat next to Allison.

16:56.929 --> 16:59.489
He checked out of the hotel a
week ago and plans to return.

16:59.565 --> 17:02.932
And he left a suitcase
in storage at the hotel.

17:03.636 --> 17:07.037
The Singapore police were happy
to seize the bag and send it to us,

17:07.106 --> 17:08.596
no questions asked.

17:08.674 --> 17:10.403
Gotta love a police state.

17:11.042 --> 17:13.034
Here comes the suitcase now.

17:36.335 --> 17:38.735
The lab's still going over
the blue Town Car.

17:38.804 --> 17:40.738
So far, no fluids or hair,

17:40.806 --> 17:43.775
but the carpeting matches the
fibers we found on Allison.

17:43.843 --> 17:46.209
This guy, Withers,
sees Allison Jenkins

17:46.278 --> 17:48.246
with a brochure
from the same hotel

17:48.314 --> 17:51.943
he's staying in and, what,
decides she's following him?

17:52.017 --> 17:53.245
Talk about extreme paranoia.

17:53.319 --> 17:55.048
He is extremely paranoid.

18:00.426 --> 18:02.417
This is nonsense.
Not to him.

18:02.495 --> 18:05.658
It's some kind
of secret writing.

18:25.017 --> 18:27.076
He scratched out their eyes.

18:27.153 --> 18:30.452
Yeah, he did the same thing to
Allison, only he used a brick.

18:33.025 --> 18:35.755
Well, this guy thinks
the whole world is after him.

18:44.036 --> 18:46.231
Goose eggs on fingerprints.

18:48.641 --> 18:52.236
These photos, they were
all taken in Asian cities.

18:52.445 --> 18:55.608
Manila, Hong Kong, Macao,
a lot of them in Macao.

18:56.415 --> 18:59.680
Withers probably spent a
lot of time in casinos there.

19:00.553 --> 19:02.043
He thinks these people
are following him.

19:02.121 --> 19:04.248
He scratches out
their eyes to...

19:05.357 --> 19:07.757
Well, it's his attempt
to neutralize them.

19:07.993 --> 19:10.484
Don't tell me
you read Paranoid.

19:10.563 --> 19:11.621
I'm learning.

19:13.199 --> 19:16.293
You know, I'm surprised that we
haven't found any money in there.

19:16.368 --> 19:18.268
He pays for
everything in cash.

19:18.337 --> 19:21.033
He would have squirreled
it away anywhere he could.

19:21.841 --> 19:23.035
That suitcase was X-rayed?

19:23.108 --> 19:25.474
Uh-huh. No hidden gold coins.

19:34.086 --> 19:35.485
Macao.

19:36.088 --> 19:38.852
He likes...
He likes gambling.

20:09.889 --> 20:13.290
Clay, doesn't show up
in X-rays.

20:13.993 --> 20:16.223
10,000 in local currency?

20:17.496 --> 20:20.761
That's a $1,300 poker chip.

20:22.468 --> 20:24.800
Lucky Angel Casino in Macao.

20:25.671 --> 20:27.138
Redeemable anytime.

20:27.206 --> 20:29.902
I wonder if he was as careful
wiping his prints off these

20:29.975 --> 20:31.806
as he was everything else.

20:35.648 --> 20:37.479
I used to deal blackjack
at the Lucky Angel,

20:37.550 --> 20:38.812
but I came back
two months ago.

20:38.884 --> 20:41.546
We found your prints
on some poker chips

20:41.620 --> 20:44.054
in a suitcase from
a hotel in Singapore.

20:44.356 --> 20:45.914
And since you used to
work in Atlantic City,

20:45.991 --> 20:48.425
your prints are
in the system.

20:48.694 --> 20:50.753
Small world.
Sure is.

20:51.397 --> 20:52.955
Roger Withers.

20:56.201 --> 20:58.829
Do you know him? The
suitcase belonged to him.

20:59.138 --> 21:02.869
Don't know the man, but I
guess he got lucky at my table.

21:02.942 --> 21:04.375
What about
Jeremy Stockton?

21:04.443 --> 21:05.842
He's a lawyer.
You know him?

21:05.911 --> 21:08.709
No, sorry. I'm trying to
cut down on my lawyers.

21:08.814 --> 21:12.113
Right, we noticed you were a
big consumer of legal services.

21:12.284 --> 21:14.275
You had a few beefs
for pimping.

21:14.353 --> 21:16.583
Don't mind my partner.
He's a little ADD.

21:16.655 --> 21:18.816
When you take
the card from the shoe,

21:18.891 --> 21:20.449
drop it in front
of each player.

21:21.427 --> 21:24.396
If the player asks for more
cards, repeat what he says

21:24.463 --> 21:26.226
so there's no
misunderstanding,

21:26.298 --> 21:28.459
and deal the cards
one at a time, face up.

21:28.767 --> 21:31.463
Your girls, are you still
in touch with them?

21:32.972 --> 21:34.530
<i>You have 14.
You're going to stand?</i>

21:34.607 --> 21:37.872
Swear to God, lady, you don't get
out of my face, I'm gonna blow!

21:37.943 --> 21:39.240
You don't want to do that,
Mr. Brightbill.

21:39.311 --> 21:41.336
Don't tell me
what I want to do!

21:42.414 --> 21:43.881
Knock it off.

21:45.284 --> 21:47.115
Okay, I'm cool.

21:48.887 --> 21:50.411
I'm done.

21:54.693 --> 21:56.354
Don't touch those.

22:01.266 --> 22:04.667
The man in the visor,
do you know who he was?

22:05.237 --> 22:08.570
No, I don't know. Just
somebody auditing the class.

22:10.876 --> 22:12.468
Thanks.
Who was your friend?

22:12.544 --> 22:14.205
People walk in off
the street all the time.

22:14.279 --> 22:16.213
That's right,
be a smart ass.

22:16.281 --> 22:19.182
By the way, did we mention
we're investigating a murder?

22:19.785 --> 22:21.446
She flew in from
Milwaukee on Wednesday.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.852
She was beaten to death
with a brick.

22:23.922 --> 22:26.390
It's a brick, Sonny.
What do you think of that?

22:26.458 --> 22:27.447
Sonny.

22:27.526 --> 22:28.720
That's my boss.

22:29.662 --> 22:31.186
Sorry I lost my cool.

22:33.565 --> 22:34.998
The only prints
on the cards

22:35.067 --> 22:36.796
belonged to
the instructor.

22:36.869 --> 22:39.133
He probably put something on his
fingertips to cover his prints,

22:39.204 --> 22:41.331
something like
liquid bandage.

22:42.541 --> 22:45.135
Qualifies him as a fulltime
paranoiac in my book.

22:45.210 --> 22:46.871
And he was using
a stopwatch to time himself.

22:46.945 --> 22:48.071
This guy likes
to push himself,

22:48.147 --> 22:50.980
not only to make the right
move, but to make it quickly.

22:51.050 --> 22:54.076
So, that's Mr. Withers.

22:54.153 --> 22:55.780
The honey in
the honey trap.

22:55.854 --> 22:58.220
And now Mr. Sonny Brightbill,
former pimp.

22:58.290 --> 23:01.726
He didn't look happy when we
told him about Allison's murder.

23:01.794 --> 23:03.386
Well, maybe he got more
than he bargained for

23:03.462 --> 23:05.225
when he partnered up
with Withers.

23:05.297 --> 23:06.696
Sonny's LUDs
show a lot of calls

23:06.765 --> 23:08.995
to prepaid
no-name cell phones.

23:09.268 --> 23:10.997
But yesterday
he made two calls

23:11.070 --> 23:13.937
to an express delivery's
tracking service.

23:19.344 --> 23:22.609
This package got here yesterday
afternoon, Mrs. Stockton.

23:22.681 --> 23:26.208
Just about the same time your
son Jeremy got one at his office.

23:26.285 --> 23:28.913
Well, I don't see what one
thing has to do with the other.

23:28.987 --> 23:31.888
We believe your son is the
target of an extortion attempt,

23:31.957 --> 23:35.757
and that the packages contain
photographs of him with a young woman.

23:37.196 --> 23:39.164
My package contained a book.

23:39.231 --> 23:41.859
And my son would not
cheat on his wife.

23:43.068 --> 23:44.296
Lovely bride.

23:45.971 --> 23:47.836
Did he marry well?

23:47.906 --> 23:49.373
He married for love.

23:49.675 --> 23:52.473
Well, all the more reason
to pay off the blackmailers.

23:52.544 --> 23:54.569
This girl is
in business with a man

23:54.646 --> 23:56.876
we suspect
murdered a young woman

23:56.949 --> 23:58.143
from Milwaukee last week.

23:58.217 --> 24:00.185
He goes by the name
of Roger Withers.

24:00.252 --> 24:02.550
They look like
very bad people,

24:02.721 --> 24:06.179
but it doesn't have anything
to do with my son.

24:06.258 --> 24:08.249
Did Jeremy make this,
when he was a kid?

24:08.327 --> 24:09.385
No, no.

24:09.461 --> 24:12.259
It's nothing.
It's just a memento.

24:12.331 --> 24:14.299
Big eyes, very intense.

24:15.067 --> 24:16.728
All these squares...
It's a map of the world.

24:16.802 --> 24:19.930
I'd rather you left
my things alone.

24:20.005 --> 24:21.029
Oh.

24:21.106 --> 24:23.768
Sorry. It's a bad habit.

24:25.878 --> 24:29.746
Hey, do you think I could borrow
your phone? I need to call in.

24:30.649 --> 24:31.638
Thanks.

24:31.717 --> 24:35.517
Mrs. Stockton,
you pay these people once,

24:35.587 --> 24:37.316
they'll keep coming back.

24:37.422 --> 24:39.913
I appreciate what
you're saying, Detective,

24:39.992 --> 24:42.324
but no one's
blackmailing my son.

24:42.394 --> 24:45.761
Well, then we're sorry for
wasting your time. Thanks.

24:47.966 --> 24:49.991
Got new pictures
of your nephew.

24:53.772 --> 24:55.865
You're like little animals,
the two of you.

24:58.043 --> 24:59.374
It's all set.

24:59.444 --> 25:00.468
They're playing ball.

25:00.546 --> 25:02.377
It's their only move.

25:02.681 --> 25:05.377
Don't sit on that.
Go stand over there.

25:08.921 --> 25:11.856
And you, take your hands
out of your pockets.

25:14.393 --> 25:16.293
Do you have the itinerary?

25:21.033 --> 25:23.866
The cops asked me
about a girl in a dumpster.

25:23.936 --> 25:25.403
Killing wasn't
part of our deal.

25:25.470 --> 25:28.962
My deal. My risks,
my rules, my deal.

25:31.243 --> 25:35.111
This will do. Now go.
You first, that way.

25:43.889 --> 25:46.050
What? You want some of this?

25:46.692 --> 25:50.389
I don't waste it on animals.
Now get out of here. That way!

25:55.834 --> 25:57.859
Next time you take
pictures with my phone,

25:57.936 --> 26:00.564
try not to erase
the ones of my nephew.

26:00.639 --> 26:02.004
Sorry.

26:03.876 --> 26:06.310
Go closer on the side
with the face.

26:06.411 --> 26:08.038
More eyes.

26:08.113 --> 26:10.343
Magnify
the back of the head.

26:16.688 --> 26:18.417
They're all
looking at this kid.

26:19.958 --> 26:22.859
This kid with a map of
the world inside his head.

26:23.528 --> 26:25.587
Can I see the other sides?

26:30.235 --> 26:35.434
<i>Sixteen squares per side, that's
four sides, that's 64 squares.</i>

26:37.809 --> 26:40.744
<i>A chess board.
Chess board has 64 squares.</i>

26:44.783 --> 26:50.119
The guy with the visor, he was
timing himself. Chess players do that.

26:50.188 --> 26:53.851
That's his connection to Ruth
Stockton and her son? Chess?

26:54.660 --> 26:56.992
What was Ruth Stockton's
maiden name?

26:58.430 --> 27:01.126
Ruth Stockton,
born Ruth Blake.

27:01.199 --> 27:04.191
Blake. Yeah,
search "Blake" and "chess. "

27:06.138 --> 27:08.299
Blake. "David Blake,
chess prodigy,

27:08.373 --> 27:11.934
"named grandmaster
in 1972 at age 18.

27:12.010 --> 27:16.276
"Became a fugitive in 1982 when he
violated the US trade embargo on Cuba

27:16.348 --> 27:20.148
"by playing a rematch there
against his Soviet rival.

27:20.218 --> 27:24.211
"He won the match and a million
dollar prize and never came home. "

27:24.589 --> 27:27.023
That was 22 years ago.

27:27.092 --> 27:28.650
And now he's back
to blackmail his family.

27:28.727 --> 27:32.322
There's a video of an interview
he gave two years ago.

27:32.397 --> 27:34.991
<i>They're parasites.
They're everywhere.</i>

27:35.067 --> 27:39.868
<i>They want me to play for the US
government, but I play for myself.</i>

27:39.938 --> 27:42.634
<i>The game is my country.</i>

27:42.708 --> 27:45.268
<i>They spread lies
about my virility,</i>

27:45.344 --> 27:49.007
<i>but I want to assure everyone
that my potency is undiminished.</i>

27:49.081 --> 27:52.016
<i>I applaud all those
who resist the Caucasian</i>

27:52.084 --> 27:54.917
<i>Judeo-Christian
military-industrial complex.</i>

27:56.154 --> 27:59.180
From chess prodigy
to paranoid prodigy.

27:59.257 --> 28:01.589
This is why
I stuck to checkers.

28:05.263 --> 28:06.855
A flight attendant
identified the man

28:06.932 --> 28:08.695
who sat next to
the murdered girl

28:08.767 --> 28:10.564
on the flight from Milwaukee.

28:10.635 --> 28:14.628
The same man we saw three days ago
at a gaming school in Manhattan.

28:23.548 --> 28:24.947
Mom, who is he?

28:26.351 --> 28:28.182
The man who made this.

28:29.888 --> 28:31.287
Uncle David?

28:32.057 --> 28:35.049
My brother would
never hurt anyone.

28:35.127 --> 28:39.359
We found these in a suitcase
he left in a hotel in Singapore.

28:54.780 --> 28:55.974
He's insane.

28:57.282 --> 29:00.843
He called me three years ago,
when our mother died.

29:01.386 --> 29:04.253
Our parents left us money.
I had to keep Davey's share,

29:04.322 --> 29:06.415
otherwise the government
would've seized it,

29:06.491 --> 29:08.152
because he's a fugitive.

29:08.226 --> 29:09.853
How much was his share?

29:12.097 --> 29:14.497
$500,000.

29:14.566 --> 29:16.158
And that's what they want,
isn't it?

29:17.636 --> 29:18.796
It's...

29:19.337 --> 29:21.828
It's okay, Mom.
It was my own stupidity.

29:24.743 --> 29:29.771
I gave that woman a ride
to her hotel in New Rochelle.

29:29.848 --> 29:31.816
We ended up in her room.

29:32.784 --> 29:37.551
I've never... I thought
I was better than that.

29:38.824 --> 29:40.121
Have you turned
the money over, yet?

29:40.192 --> 29:42.854
No. We have it.

29:42.928 --> 29:46.329
A messenger service will pick
it up tomorrow morning at 9:00.

29:46.398 --> 29:48.491
We'll need to see
what they sent you.

29:51.470 --> 29:54.064
Davey was under
so much pressure,

29:54.139 --> 29:57.506
all the publicity,
the politics, the money.

29:58.510 --> 30:01.570
By the time he was 16,
he was supporting our family.

30:03.448 --> 30:05.416
Everybody wanted
a piece of him.

30:07.018 --> 30:10.545
It got worse when he
became Grandmaster.

30:10.622 --> 30:12.089
He became so eccentric.

30:12.157 --> 30:14.148
Well, it's not eccentricity.

30:14.226 --> 30:16.717
It's mental illness.

30:20.332 --> 30:22.129
I want to show you something.

30:26.371 --> 30:31.274
This was in 1966, at the
youth center on Roosevelt.

30:31.943 --> 30:36.004
<i>He'd just defeated a 24-
year-old champion in a tournament.</i>

30:36.781 --> 30:39.807
They named him chess master.
He was 12.

30:41.453 --> 30:43.546
Nobody knew who he was yet.

30:44.256 --> 30:45.723
He was happy.

30:46.424 --> 30:48.415
The best day of his life.

30:49.995 --> 30:52.225
We've got the flash money
on the tops of each stack.

30:52.297 --> 30:55.425
Underneath's the funny money, good
enough to pass the first look test.

30:55.500 --> 30:56.990
This little guy goes with it.

30:57.068 --> 30:59.935
All your units will have a radio run
of where the money is at all times.

31:00.005 --> 31:03.338
All right. Let's get it over to
the Stockton house now. Thanks.

31:03.742 --> 31:05.573
What's this?
The route the money's taking?

31:05.644 --> 31:06.668
Yeah.

31:06.745 --> 31:10.545
The first one's picking up the
money at Ruth Stockton's house,

31:10.615 --> 31:12.276
taking it to a mailbox
store in Brooklyn.

31:12.350 --> 31:13.840
They're holding it
for another courier.

31:13.919 --> 31:15.284
I'm calling them now.

31:15.353 --> 31:17.412
I want units at
every stop along the way.

31:17.489 --> 31:19.252
Yeah, I need to
check on a pickup

31:19.324 --> 31:21.451
that you have scheduled
for tomorrow morning

31:21.526 --> 31:24.586
at 10:15 at
a Mailbox Unlimited.

31:25.697 --> 31:27.597
Right, a duffel bag.

31:27.666 --> 31:30.362
Yeah, I need to verify
that destination.

31:34.472 --> 31:37.134
Okay. Thank you.

31:37.576 --> 31:41.603
They're having it delivered
to a limo company, Lush Ride.

31:42.881 --> 31:45.611
A limo company. That's
an odd choice for Blake.

31:45.684 --> 31:49.381
But Lush Ride might be how a
working girl gets around town.

31:50.622 --> 31:52.920
I got hired to give the
guy a birthday surprise.

31:52.991 --> 31:56.188
But I had no idea somebody
was covering the event.

31:56.995 --> 31:59.896
And you had no idea
that when you booked

31:59.965 --> 32:02.092
a pickup with Lush Ride
for tomorrow morning,

32:02.167 --> 32:05.694
that it was to pick up a
bag full of Stockton's money?

32:07.339 --> 32:09.432
That blue car you had towed?

32:10.342 --> 32:13.709
It was used in
the murder of this girl.

32:14.746 --> 32:16.008
I didn't kill her.

32:16.081 --> 32:17.742
We don't care.

32:17.816 --> 32:19.613
You're who we've got.

32:23.888 --> 32:27.619
It was that crazy guy Sonny met
while he was working in Asia.

32:29.261 --> 32:33.197
Yeah, that's him. But I
don't know where he is.

32:33.265 --> 32:36.359
Aren't you supposed to hook
up with him to split the money?

32:36.434 --> 32:39.164
Well, I don't always do
what I'm supposed to do.

32:40.038 --> 32:42.734
You know all those drivers
at Lush Ride, huh?

32:43.642 --> 32:46.202
You and Sonny
paid off the driver

32:46.278 --> 32:48.143
to switch the bags,
didn't you?

32:51.783 --> 32:54.752
That money's never going
to make it to the next stop.

32:58.990 --> 33:01.857
Well, Blake's no idiot.
He must've planned for this.

33:01.926 --> 33:03.723
He must have another move.

33:06.064 --> 33:07.861
Move! Out of the way!

33:09.067 --> 33:10.159
Davey.

33:10.235 --> 33:12.726
Where is it?
The money, where is it?

33:14.005 --> 33:16.235
Stop looking at me.
Get the bag.

33:16.308 --> 33:18.333
Get the bag. Get it!

33:18.410 --> 33:21.072
Davey, you didn't
have to do this.

33:21.146 --> 33:23.546
I would have
given you the money.

33:24.749 --> 33:27.513
Davey, Mama wanted you to have
the money, but I couldn't send it.

33:27.585 --> 33:29.985
The government
would've taken it.

33:40.532 --> 33:44.525
Tell those parasites they can
track that straight to hell.

33:45.303 --> 33:47.794
All right, over here,
the radiator.

33:49.841 --> 33:51.502
Davey, look at me.

33:53.745 --> 33:56.111
I've missed you so much.

34:14.032 --> 34:15.431
You kept it?

34:17.001 --> 34:18.059
Why?

34:19.237 --> 34:20.636
Why, Ruthie?

34:21.373 --> 34:22.601
Why?

34:24.109 --> 34:25.167
Why?

34:32.751 --> 34:34.116
My mother
could've been killed.

34:34.185 --> 34:35.675
Why wasn't somebody
watching the house?

34:35.754 --> 34:38.655
Our units were scheduled to be
in place an hour before pickup.

34:38.723 --> 34:41.987
Your uncle moved up the
timetable by three hours.

34:42.060 --> 34:45.188
Well, it doesn't matter now.
We want you to leave.

34:45.263 --> 34:49.427
Mrs. Stockton, once your brother
figures out the money's fake,

34:49.501 --> 34:51.230
he'll try to
contact you again.

34:51.302 --> 34:53.896
The man who came here,
I've never seen him before.

34:53.972 --> 34:55.063
It wasn't Davey.

34:55.139 --> 34:56.902
Then how did
this get broken?

34:58.610 --> 35:02.410
He was upset that you'd kept
this? Upset that you cared?

35:03.882 --> 35:05.941
When he realizes
that he's been tricked

35:06.017 --> 35:07.006
and that the money
is not real...

35:07.085 --> 35:08.382
That wasn't my idea.

35:08.453 --> 35:10.853
But he doesn't know that,
and it might break him.

35:10.922 --> 35:12.787
And he'll be out there alone.
You won't be there to help him.

35:12.857 --> 35:14.654
Is that what you want?

35:15.293 --> 35:17.284
I can't help you
put him in prison.

35:22.367 --> 35:24.835
I'm filing a petition for a
temporary restraining order

35:24.903 --> 35:27.235
to keep you away
from my mother.

35:27.405 --> 35:28.838
No following her,
no questioning her,

35:28.907 --> 35:31.341
no coming within
one city block of her home.

35:31.409 --> 35:33.172
That should
make our job easy.

35:33.244 --> 35:36.441
It's in effect until we can convince
the judge we know what we're doing.

35:36.514 --> 35:38.675
Can't Mr. Brightbill tell us
where Mr. Blake is?

35:38.750 --> 35:39.944
We picked him up an hour ago.

35:40.018 --> 35:41.212
He lawyered up.
He hasn't said a word.

35:46.624 --> 35:48.854
She just got on
the phone with him.

35:48.927 --> 35:52.226
We're getting a live feed
from the listening post.

35:52.297 --> 35:53.321
Listening post?

35:53.398 --> 35:56.424
For the wiretap we set up last
night on Ruth Stockton's phone.

35:56.501 --> 35:59.402
Don't worry, Counselor, they're
three blocks away from his house.

35:59.471 --> 36:02.668
<i>I'm sorry, Davey, but until
I saw you, I didn't know.</i>

36:02.740 --> 36:05.004
<i>I have your money.
I want to give it to you.</i>

36:05.076 --> 36:07.476
<i>They're listening.
It's not safe.</i>

36:07.912 --> 36:08.970
<i>NF3.</i>

36:09.747 --> 36:10.736
<i>G3.</i>

36:11.483 --> 36:13.007
<i>BG2.</i>

36:13.084 --> 36:15.484
<i>Yes, all right, Davey.
I understand.</i>

36:15.687 --> 36:18.850
Mrs. Stockton still
has the $500,000 cash.

36:18.923 --> 36:19.947
It's her money.

36:20.024 --> 36:22.083
These have to be chess moves.

36:24.496 --> 36:29.263
Knight to f3, pawn to g3, bishop to g2.

36:30.568 --> 36:33.537
The moves are for
the "King's Indian Attack,"

36:34.405 --> 36:36.339
the gambit Blake used
to win the tournament

36:36.407 --> 36:38.637
that made him
a chess master at 12.

36:40.378 --> 36:43.313
The tournament was at the
youth center in Queens.

36:43.381 --> 36:44.905
The best day of his life.

37:54.752 --> 37:56.151
Young lady.

37:58.256 --> 37:59.985
Protect your queen.

38:26.284 --> 38:28.275
Hey, you kids need
to step outside...

38:39.063 --> 38:40.394
Stay away.

38:41.466 --> 38:45.459
David, that was a good move,
clearing away from the kids.

38:48.439 --> 38:51.431
You know, they say that
you were brilliant that day.

38:53.611 --> 38:55.010
At 12 years old.

38:56.981 --> 38:59.415
Your flame burned
bright back then.

38:59.951 --> 39:01.714
It burns brighter now.

39:01.786 --> 39:02.946
Brighter?

39:03.988 --> 39:07.583
You think that kid would've
been fooled by a sacrificed pawn?

39:07.659 --> 39:08.785
Pawn?

39:08.860 --> 39:12.296
Allison Jenkins, the girl
with the travel brochures.

39:15.967 --> 39:19.027
It was no coincidence
that she sat next to you.

39:19.303 --> 39:20.998
But you know that.

39:22.006 --> 39:24.474
You're trying to get me
to admit something?

39:24.542 --> 39:25.941
Killing her.

39:27.545 --> 39:30.912
You think that was the right
move, I mean, in theory,

39:30.982 --> 39:33.280
if she was there
to spy on you?

39:34.052 --> 39:36.247
If you hadn't killed Allison,

39:36.688 --> 39:39.384
we would've never connected
you to the blue Town Car.

39:39.457 --> 39:42.085
Or Sonny's girlfriend,
or your nephew.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.923
No, wrong!

39:43.995 --> 39:46.020
Or the hotel in Singapore.

39:51.969 --> 39:53.766
Or this piece, David.

39:56.741 --> 39:58.641
This was the key piece.

39:59.077 --> 40:03.480
As we speak, there are people
decoding your encrypted writing,

40:04.115 --> 40:07.050
because you blundered, David.
You took the sacrificed pawn.

40:07.118 --> 40:08.415
No.
You killed Allison.

40:08.486 --> 40:10.283
No, it was the right move.

40:10.354 --> 40:11.514
Why are you here?

40:15.860 --> 40:17.259
Surrounded.

40:19.564 --> 40:21.589
All your secrets exposed.

40:25.737 --> 40:26.795
I made a blunder.

40:26.871 --> 40:27.895
Yes, you did.

40:27.972 --> 40:32.500
Now, David, look, I need you to
take your hand out of the binder.

40:32.577 --> 40:35.705
No. I have a move.

40:35.780 --> 40:36.804
David.

40:38.750 --> 40:40.411
Get away from me.

40:40.885 --> 40:43.115
I want everybody to
get out of the room.

40:44.155 --> 40:45.588
You're resigning?

40:48.860 --> 40:51.624
You're conceding defeat?
That's not a move.

40:52.463 --> 40:53.862
I can't win.

40:55.266 --> 40:56.665
They wouldn't let me play.

40:56.734 --> 40:58.861
How could they not
let me play?

40:58.936 --> 41:00.563
You mean in Cuba?

41:00.838 --> 41:02.169
But chess is not
about politics.

41:02.240 --> 41:03.935
You know that.
It's about individuals.

41:04.008 --> 41:06.135
It's the ultimate challenge
of individuals.

41:06.210 --> 41:07.268
Yes.

41:07.712 --> 41:10.237
And they refused me
permission to play.

41:10.314 --> 41:12.305
And it's all I know how to do.

41:12.383 --> 41:13.441
And you're the best at it.

41:13.518 --> 41:14.542
Yes.

41:15.586 --> 41:18.487
The children here,
they study your games

41:18.556 --> 41:21.957
and they commit your
strategies to memory.

41:22.026 --> 41:25.985
You're an example of what
it means to be a Grandmaster.

41:26.931 --> 41:30.526
Well, isn't it true
that a Grandmaster

41:32.336 --> 41:34.770
will only resign
as a last resort?

41:36.240 --> 41:37.798
When he has to.

41:39.677 --> 41:41.440
But if they have another move?

41:45.583 --> 41:49.019
They play to the draw.
Isn't that right?

41:49.086 --> 41:53.386
If he can, a Grandmaster
will play for the draw.

41:55.026 --> 41:56.653
Stay in the game.

42:01.666 --> 42:03.258
You can see your next move.

42:08.005 --> 42:09.802
So, show them, David.

42:12.276 --> 42:14.904
Show them how a Grandmaster
plays the game.

42:24.722 --> 42:27.520
You're under arrest
for murder, Mr. Blake.

42:31.596 --> 42:32.893
That was
the right move, David.

42:32.964 --> 42:34.226
I know.

42:36.834 --> 42:40.167
This government has
no jurisdiction over me.

42:40.738 --> 42:44.265
I name the United Nations
as my legal representative.

42:44.342 --> 42:47.937
I have documentation to
present to the General Assembly

42:48.012 --> 42:51.106
that my human rights
have been violated.

42:51.182 --> 42:54.811
I'm serving notice on the
government of the United States.

42:58.389 --> 43:01.324
Sounds like he's figured
out his next move.

43:02.960 --> 43:04.484
See, that's what
happens when you

43:04.562 --> 43:07.122
keep people from doing
what they do best.

43:09.533 --> 43:11.330
It makes them insane.

43:12.305 --> 43:18.282
