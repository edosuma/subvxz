00:06.073 --> 00:09.510
Everybody's gonna be
pumped to see the plate man.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.078
No, they're not, baby.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.672
Oh, here comes the plate man!

00:12.672 --> 00:14.107
Can't have a barbecue without plates!

00:14.140 --> 00:15.608
Uncle George, look at this!

00:15.642 --> 00:17.577
Paper bowls for dips, sides.

00:17.610 --> 00:19.612
Hey, hey! Plate man!

00:19.646 --> 00:22.582
- Hi, Mom.
- Chrissy, you look

00:22.615 --> 00:24.815
- beautiful in purple.
- My baby.

00:25.018 --> 00:27.454
And look at Tim. Don't you look cute.

00:27.487 --> 00:29.105
Oh, thank you.

00:29.105 --> 00:32.107
- Yeah, he knows.
- Hi, David! George!

00:32.142 --> 00:33.243
Aww...

00:33.675 --> 00:34.811
Sam's here.

00:37.423 --> 00:38.715
Who's he with?

00:40.270 --> 00:41.726
Sam, who are you with? Who are you?

00:42.108 --> 00:43.186
Uh, I'm Shannon.

00:43.219 --> 00:44.254
This is Shannon, Tim.

00:44.287 --> 00:45.755
Hi, Shannon. Who are you?

00:46.174 --> 00:47.808
She's my girlfriend.

00:48.475 --> 00:49.599
Girlfriend?

00:50.825 --> 00:51.898
Since when?

00:52.040 --> 00:54.315
Ah, feels like a day,
it's been so much fun.

00:54.348 --> 00:56.317
- How long?
- I don't know.

00:56.350 --> 00:57.785
It's been a blur, it's been so much fun.

00:57.818 --> 01:00.354
- How long?
- It's been a blur.

01:00.388 --> 01:01.789
- How long?
- A month!

01:01.822 --> 01:03.346
A whole friggin' month!

01:03.346 --> 01:05.382
You've had a girlfriend
that you've hid from me

01:05.416 --> 01:07.416
- for a month?
- I know!

01:07.985 --> 01:09.186
Well, technically, babe,

01:09.220 --> 01:10.671
it's about five weeks.

01:11.622 --> 01:14.538
Tim, it's your own friggin' fault, okay?

01:14.538 --> 01:17.842
I... you can be difficult
to introduce new people to.

01:18.364 --> 01:19.800
- Why?
- Why?

01:19.898 --> 01:21.538
This guy says "why?"

01:21.722 --> 01:24.381
Because, Tim, you can be a little harsh.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.514
Harsh?

01:27.088 --> 01:28.089
Harsh?

01:28.704 --> 01:30.024
Okay, Shannon, how are you?

01:30.344 --> 01:31.445
- Uh...
- You look lovely.

01:31.478 --> 01:32.813
Is that blouse from Ann Taylor?

01:32.846 --> 01:34.515
- No.
- Well, someone should tell

01:34.548 --> 01:36.288
Ann Taylor, because they
have a very similar one.

01:36.462 --> 01:37.998
What are you even
trying to go for with this?

01:37.998 --> 01:39.700
I shop for Chrissy at Ann Taylor.

01:40.369 --> 01:42.705
I'm just saying, I think
they'd be very interested

01:42.738 --> 01:44.883
in knowing that someone's
selling a cheaper version.

01:45.107 --> 01:46.509
How do you know this one's cheaper?

01:46.542 --> 01:49.812
'Cause I shop for Chrissy
at Ann Taylor, idiot!

01:49.845 --> 01:51.747
It could be nicer, dillweed.

01:51.781 --> 01:54.116
It's... not!

01:54.553 --> 01:56.027
Um, nice to meet you, Tim.

01:56.052 --> 01:57.879
I've... heard lots about you.

01:58.775 --> 02:00.248
All good things, I'm sure.

02:00.898 --> 02:01.884
Yeah.

02:02.488 --> 02:03.937
- Let's go say hi to my mom.
- Okay.

02:03.962 --> 02:05.003
- What did you bring, slop?
- No.

02:05.028 --> 02:05.970
Come on, now.

Oh, my God, it's Shannon Coyne.

02:22.940 --> 02:24.009
- That's Shannon Coyne.
- You got to be cool.

02:24.034 --> 02:25.146
I'm being cool.

02:25.171 --> 02:28.466
Wow, Shannon Coyne.

02:28.655 --> 02:31.391
Oh, we grew up listening to
your family's gospel music.

02:31.424 --> 02:32.826
- Thank you.
- So what's it like

02:32.859 --> 02:34.260
dating a celebrity?

02:34.294 --> 02:35.795
Oh, I don't know, babe. What's it like?

02:35.829 --> 02:37.234
Oh, Sam.

02:37.234 --> 02:39.270
- She's talking about me.
- I know, I was joking.

02:39.303 --> 02:40.537
How do you get up in
front of all those people?

02:40.571 --> 02:42.239
I would be so scared.

02:42.273 --> 02:44.475
You know, actually I have stage fright,

02:44.508 --> 02:46.479
so I get up there

02:46.978 --> 02:48.913
and I close my eyes

02:49.379 --> 02:53.250
and I...

02:55.366 --> 02:57.285
Yeah, would you like to take a selfie?

02:58.236 --> 02:59.473
You know who that is?

02:59.976 --> 03:01.506
That's Sam's girlfriend.

03:01.539 --> 03:02.548
Hm.

03:03.441 --> 03:05.706
I know. He hid it from me for a month

03:05.706 --> 03:07.580
because I'm too harsh.

03:08.174 --> 03:09.929
Well, Tim, you can be harsh.

03:10.247 --> 03:12.390
Maybe Sam just want to
build something first

03:12.390 --> 03:13.709
before you bulldozed it.

03:13.709 --> 03:15.073
Bulldozed it?

03:15.811 --> 03:19.364
I have been nothing but lovely
to all Sam's girlfriends.

03:20.203 --> 03:23.073
I was a perfect gentleman
to Dump Truck Debra.

03:23.655 --> 03:25.084
I've been nice to all of them.

03:25.490 --> 03:27.771
Stupid Sarah, Dumb Beth,

03:27.771 --> 03:29.541
Debbie "The Animal" Steel, the Worm.

03:29.541 --> 03:32.244
- Tim.
- I was so nice to the Worm.

03:32.278 --> 03:33.446
Would you listen to yourself?

03:33.479 --> 03:34.814
You're harsh as hell.

03:34.847 --> 03:37.461
Okay, if it's because I'm too harsh,

03:37.750 --> 03:40.286
then how come he kept it a
secret from the whole family.

03:40.806 --> 03:42.161
He didn't tell your parents,

03:42.199 --> 03:44.231
Aunt Lacey, your grandma, you.

03:46.031 --> 03:47.146
Holy shit.

03:47.733 --> 03:48.878
You knew.

03:50.636 --> 03:52.355
Oh, my God, you all knew.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.202
The whole family knew, and they lied to me.

03:55.322 --> 03:56.623
They lied to my face!

03:56.657 --> 03:58.692
- Well...
- You're a family of liars!

03:59.039 --> 04:01.175
Big, fake liars!

04:02.646 --> 04:03.744
Liar!

04:04.201 --> 04:06.276
- Hey, girl!
- I love your hair.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.735
Welcome, welcome, one and all

04:11.735 --> 04:14.004
to the Duvet family reunion!

04:15.939 --> 04:17.974
We got drinks and, of course,

04:18.007 --> 04:20.543
we've got the annual basketball game,

04:20.577 --> 04:24.007
which my team has won six years in a row.

04:25.039 --> 04:26.950
Now listen, over 30 years ago,

04:27.584 --> 04:30.743
I took over the position as
grill master from my father.

04:31.159 --> 04:32.903
Today it gives me great honor

04:33.097 --> 04:35.122
to pass this on to my son,

04:35.273 --> 04:36.425
Samuel!

04:37.968 --> 04:39.716
Have you all met his new girlfriend?

04:39.755 --> 04:41.156
Shannon Coyne!

04:41.190 --> 04:42.307
Yes!

04:42.858 --> 04:45.869
Good looks, personality, and lineage.

04:46.128 --> 04:49.198
Yes, I'm telling you,
she is the total package.

04:49.231 --> 04:50.832
And she's a celebrity.

04:50.832 --> 04:51.934
Come on up here, son.

04:58.540 --> 05:00.042
Ah. Thanks, Dad.

05:00.477 --> 05:01.971
You know, this is an honor

05:01.971 --> 05:04.168
I've waited for my entire life.

05:04.356 --> 05:07.330
In fact, when I was 7, I wrote a speech

05:07.792 --> 05:09.141
I bring with me every reunion.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.295
- Should I read it?
- Yes!

05:11.329 --> 05:13.164
- Should I read it?
- Yes!

05:13.198 --> 05:15.433
- Should I read this here speech?
- Yes!

05:15.467 --> 05:17.854
Well, if you insist.

05:18.594 --> 05:21.297
"Friends, Duvets, and guests,

05:21.329 --> 05:24.299
"I am honored to be your grill master.

05:24.696 --> 05:26.532
"It's an achievement I rank up there

05:26.565 --> 05:28.100
with my black belt in tae kwon do"...

05:28.133 --> 05:29.736
Oop, never did that.

05:30.469 --> 05:32.029
Let's see. Oop.

05:32.504 --> 05:33.588
Never did that.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.988
"Quick thank you to Grandpa Charles."

05:37.971 --> 05:40.045
He's dead. Sad.

05:40.078 --> 05:41.780
Uh, didn't do that.

05:42.226 --> 05:43.554
"Marry Mom"?

05:43.882 --> 05:45.676
I was 7, again,

05:45.676 --> 05:47.031
when I wrote this, so...

05:47.827 --> 05:50.214
Still seems kind of old to want to do that.

05:50.247 --> 05:53.181
Really should have looked over
this at some point since then.

05:53.551 --> 05:56.436
Oh, "And never getting in a car"

05:56.484 --> 05:57.851
with a stranger"

05:58.106 --> 06:00.241
'cause stranger danger."

06:00.504 --> 06:01.656
Hmm? Never did that.

06:01.656 --> 06:03.888
So... and you shouldn't,
so that's a good thing.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.209
Kids, learn from it.

06:05.243 --> 06:06.352
Ah, thank you!

06:06.352 --> 06:07.475
Uh, yep.

06:08.488 --> 06:10.007
Thank you very much, son.

06:12.435 --> 06:13.459
All right.

06:13.852 --> 06:15.453
I hope your bellies are empty

06:15.628 --> 06:17.336
and you're ready for fun,

06:17.530 --> 06:20.032
because the Duvet family reunion

06:20.066 --> 06:22.101
has officially begun!

06:29.396 --> 06:30.722
Medium rare for the gentleman.

06:31.878 --> 06:33.239
And for the lady...

06:33.433 --> 06:35.258
- Ooh!
- Well done.

06:35.258 --> 06:37.494
- All right, man.
- Ange, you want a hot dog?

06:40.459 --> 06:42.416
Whoo! Now that's a hot dog.

06:42.450 --> 06:44.042
Am I right? Am I right?

06:44.498 --> 06:45.576
Here you go.

06:46.021 --> 06:47.989
You know your dad was
supposed to be pass long

06:48.022 --> 06:49.190
grill master to me.

06:49.612 --> 06:51.547
But, see, I just quit drinking,

06:51.581 --> 06:53.349
and so I got the shakes,

06:53.549 --> 06:55.283
but I'm happier, healthier.

06:55.476 --> 06:57.764
Oh! What you got there, man?

06:58.846 --> 07:00.332
That smell like Crown Royal.

07:01.391 --> 07:03.162
Ladies, may I?

07:03.162 --> 07:04.730
Of course, sweetie. Come on.

07:05.504 --> 07:07.073
No paper bowls, huh?

07:07.106 --> 07:08.489
Just cream corn touching everything?

07:08.490 --> 07:10.674
Oh, we were just talking
about how nice it is

07:10.699 --> 07:13.421
that Sam could meet
himself a gospel singer.

07:13.421 --> 07:15.480
I heard the whole
family sing at Chene Park.

07:15.525 --> 07:17.741
- Beautiful.
- So talented.

07:17.773 --> 07:19.541
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah,

07:19.575 --> 07:21.210
but there's really no way to tell.

07:21.243 --> 07:23.768
I mean, it's not like you
can boo a gospel singer.

07:25.637 --> 07:27.896
No, she's... she is so nice.

07:28.117 --> 07:31.053
She's lovely, lovely.

07:31.086 --> 07:34.034
But did anybody taste

07:34.059 --> 07:36.090
the potato salad she brought?

07:36.558 --> 07:38.761
I mean, I don't want to say it's bland,

07:38.794 --> 07:40.596
but I saw a fly land on it,

07:40.933 --> 07:42.611
fly away, come back with some salt.

07:42.611 --> 07:45.285
Tim! You're bad.

07:45.581 --> 07:47.383
Potato salad?
More like "poor" -tato salad.

07:47.416 --> 07:49.467
Yeah.

07:50.114 --> 07:52.054
Look, look, look on the bright side.

07:52.088 --> 07:54.356
At least we know Sam's
gonna lose some weight.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.471
Oh!

07:58.527 --> 08:00.062
Too much she can't lose any weight

08:00.096 --> 08:02.064
in that big ol' head of hers.

08:02.098 --> 08:04.100
Whoo!

08:04.133 --> 08:06.635
She walk by and I
thought it was an eclipse!

08:07.970 --> 08:10.423
Aunt Lacey! Aunt Lacey's joining!

08:10.423 --> 08:13.650
Let's just hope Sam
likes doing neck rubs,

08:13.675 --> 08:16.278
'cause that neck of
hers is doing some work.

08:16.311 --> 08:18.179
Yeah.

08:18.213 --> 08:20.682
Looking like a lollipop
in knockoff Ann Taylor.

08:20.715 --> 08:22.684
Yes! Yes, it is!

08:22.717 --> 08:24.085
- It's knockoff!
- I know.

08:26.688 --> 08:28.657
- Hey.
- Hi, Shannon. Hope you're having fun.

08:29.925 --> 08:31.960
So, really, I'm happy for Sam.

08:31.993 --> 08:33.828
She truly is a sweet girl.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.764
Yeah, no, she's so sweet.

08:35.797 --> 08:37.673
She's made of sugar. Hope it doesn't rain;

08:37.698 --> 08:39.639
she turns into a [BLEEP] puddle!

08:40.126 --> 08:41.177
Timothy.

08:41.202 --> 08:43.004
- That mouth.
- Mm-mm-mm.

08:43.038 --> 08:44.839
We were having fun,
but that's carrying it

08:44.873 --> 08:45.840
a little too far.

08:45.874 --> 08:47.137
I wasn't having fun.

08:47.982 --> 08:49.635
Enjoy your meals all mushed together.

08:52.047 --> 08:54.182
Sam. Congratulations on becoming

08:54.215 --> 08:55.545
grill master.

08:55.545 --> 08:56.985
Go ahead with your insult, Chrissy.

08:57.018 --> 08:59.054
- I don't have an insult.
- Why? Too dumb?

08:59.087 --> 09:00.889
- I'm just surprised.
- Damn it.

09:00.922 --> 09:02.624
You're brave enough to
take on this responsibility

09:02.657 --> 09:04.659
after you quit Dad's restaurant.

09:04.693 --> 09:06.673
I was 15.

09:06.717 --> 09:08.419
Nobody even cares about that anymore.

09:08.452 --> 09:09.643
Daddy cares.

09:09.643 --> 09:11.423
You quit the waffle
station right in the middle

09:11.455 --> 09:12.657
of Mothers' Day brunch.

09:12.690 --> 09:15.245
People just pouring syrup on waffle batter.

09:15.426 --> 09:17.799
- So sad.
- Dog food over there, Chrissy.

09:17.799 --> 09:19.067
Why don't you go eat up? Hey!

09:19.101 --> 09:20.435
Hurry it up up there!

09:20.469 --> 09:22.371
Whoo, you call this well-done?

09:22.720 --> 09:24.321
I took a bite out of it; it said,

09:24.355 --> 09:25.828
"Ouch, you hurting me!"

09:27.804 --> 09:30.618
She said it talked!

09:32.512 --> 09:34.083
Hey! Hey, you kids!

09:34.304 --> 09:36.039
Don't go wandering off in them woods.

09:36.479 --> 09:38.110
Might mess around and get snatched up

09:38.110 --> 09:39.170
by the Fork Bandit!

09:39.468 --> 09:41.450
Y'all don't know who the Fork Bandit is?

09:41.925 --> 09:43.612
They don't know who the Fork Bandit is.

09:43.723 --> 09:45.897
He was a kid, just like you.

09:46.126 --> 09:48.069
He wandered off from a barbecue,

09:48.295 --> 09:49.772
couldn't find his family,

09:49.772 --> 09:53.642
and now he's a dusty crackhead
with nothing but a fork!

09:53.676 --> 09:55.558
Anytime today, Sam.

09:56.035 --> 09:58.080
It's gonna be just a slight delay.

09:58.114 --> 09:59.648
Sam gotta speed up.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.784
This long line's driving me to drink.

10:02.157 --> 10:03.363
Driving me to drink.

10:03.388 --> 10:04.739
Hey, come on, now. Look here.

10:04.739 --> 10:06.741
This is a brand-new grill master.

10:07.096 --> 10:08.856
We gotta give him a chance to find his way.

10:08.856 --> 10:09.957
Flip six, son.

10:09.990 --> 10:11.826
- Uh, yeah.
- In a little while,

10:11.859 --> 10:13.294
he's gonna be out-grilling us all,

10:13.327 --> 10:14.662
providing he don't quit.

10:14.695 --> 10:16.526
I'm not going to quit, Dad.

10:16.551 --> 10:19.554
You're not again, because
now you are a grown man,

10:19.672 --> 10:22.639
and this is a responsibility.

10:23.793 --> 10:26.762
Son, get rid of eight and nine.

10:26.796 --> 10:27.941
They done.

10:28.692 --> 10:31.862
- Hey, grill master.
- Hey, baby.

10:31.895 --> 10:34.164
Mwah. Babe, look at us.

10:34.197 --> 10:36.520
I mean, me impressing your family,

10:36.567 --> 10:38.268
you're grill master.

10:38.587 --> 10:40.070
We're the hits of this party, babe.

10:40.368 --> 10:42.705
Yep, everybody loves us and
is happy with our performance.

10:42.739 --> 10:44.908
That they are, and that they do.

10:45.181 --> 10:46.616
- Give it to me.
- Mwah.

10:47.073 --> 10:49.000
Hey, Shannon. Can I get a picture?

10:49.419 --> 10:50.875
I have something better for you.

10:52.088 --> 10:54.391
♪ Leave a message ♪

10:54.424 --> 10:55.585
♪ God is good ♪

10:55.585 --> 10:57.153
Whoo!

10:57.687 --> 10:58.908
For when they call.

10:58.908 --> 10:59.876
Hey, guys!

11:00.268 --> 11:01.917
There's paper bowls here.

11:01.917 --> 11:03.204
New this year.

11:03.238 --> 11:05.046
Good for dip, sides, whatever.

11:05.071 --> 11:07.154
Look kind of fun. Try 'em out.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.445
No bowl, sweetie?

11:10.478 --> 11:11.840
No bowls.

11:12.281 --> 11:15.503
- Who's this?
- My friend from school, Evan.

11:15.985 --> 11:17.962
- How you doing, Evan?
- Tim Cramblin. Cramblin Advertising.

11:17.962 --> 11:19.797
- You want to hear a joke?
- No, I don't.

11:20.454 --> 11:22.774
I just don't think a little kid's joke

11:22.774 --> 11:24.743
is ever going to make
me, an adult man, laugh.

11:25.459 --> 11:28.046
Thanks, though. Just don't
have the life experience.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.639
- Thank you.
- Hey, Uncle Tim?

11:29.717 --> 11:31.016
Yes, sweetie?

11:31.049 --> 11:32.497
Sometimes I think things

11:32.522 --> 11:34.091
but I don't say them out loud,

11:34.124 --> 11:35.425
'cause then people hear them

11:35.459 --> 11:36.860
and they might hurt their feelings.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.156
Oh, my God.

11:43.248 --> 11:44.636
I am harsh.

11:45.738 --> 11:46.978
I'm harsh!

11:47.641 --> 11:48.625
Thank you.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.042
Ooh.

11:55.742 --> 11:56.980
It's okay, son. I got this.

11:57.014 --> 11:58.082
Don't worry about a thing.

11:58.415 --> 11:59.930
Ah, Sam.

12:04.277 --> 12:05.522
You got divorced.

12:05.555 --> 12:07.157
You're not in the family anymore.

12:07.190 --> 12:08.598
You got to give up that shirt.

12:08.623 --> 12:09.621
Chrissy.

12:10.527 --> 12:13.030
I am so sorry I called
your family pig-faced liars.

12:13.063 --> 12:14.979
Mm, thank you, baby.

12:14.979 --> 12:17.015
And I'm sorry I said
[BLEEP] in front of your mom.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.849
- You did?
- Yeah.

12:19.128 --> 12:20.806
And Aunt Lacey and Old Shirley.

12:21.691 --> 12:23.326
But I'm not that person anymore.

12:23.855 --> 12:25.141
I am harsh.

12:25.819 --> 12:27.374
I realize that now.

12:27.374 --> 12:30.507
It took a weird little kid with
a shitty joke I never heard,

12:30.532 --> 12:32.011
but I'm gonna be a better man.

12:32.621 --> 12:33.687
I love you so much.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.990
- Mm.
- I love you too, baby.

12:38.092 --> 12:40.326
Hey, girl! I like that hat.

12:41.522 --> 12:43.157
Have fun, everybody.

12:43.190 --> 12:44.451
Oh, and Sam?

12:44.758 --> 12:46.560
Take it easy on your daddy.

12:46.593 --> 12:48.662
I need him in tip-top shape today.

12:48.695 --> 12:50.965
Oh! Gross! Mom!

12:50.966 --> 12:52.766
Hey, be happy for me.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.343
I'm gonna let you take it out first.

12:54.568 --> 12:56.608
'Cause you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.129
Let's ball.

12:59.606 --> 13:00.741
What you got, Sam?

13:00.774 --> 13:01.937
What you got, bro?

13:01.962 --> 13:04.331
What you got? What you got? What you got?

13:04.908 --> 13:05.848
Money!

13:06.948 --> 13:09.106
David!

13:11.323 --> 13:12.484
Look here, Sam. Now, look.

13:12.484 --> 13:14.054
When you're guarding somebody,
you got to bend your knees

13:14.088 --> 13:15.203
and put your hands in the air.

13:15.203 --> 13:16.938
I know how to play defense, Dad.

13:16.971 --> 13:18.918
Really? Then how come you
let me bust this in your face?

13:19.363 --> 13:21.310
- Whoo!
- Yes!

13:26.178 --> 13:27.974
- Sam, bounce pass.
- Coming your way, baby.

13:28.028 --> 13:29.250
You don't call the kind
of pass you're gonna do

13:29.284 --> 13:30.310
before you do it.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.477
I'm just having fun
playing with you, buddy.

13:34.237 --> 13:35.281
Ball game!

13:36.675 --> 13:37.743
David!

13:38.039 --> 13:39.295
Kick it! Kick it!

13:39.320 --> 13:40.420
Kick it!

13:40.453 --> 13:42.773
Wait a minute. Reset, reset, reset!

13:42.839 --> 13:44.073
I wasn't ready. Come on.

13:44.107 --> 13:45.475
Kick it! Kick it! Kick it!

13:54.784 --> 13:57.060
Pass it, Sam. It's out or your range.

13:57.060 --> 13:59.061
No, it's not. Here comes fade away.

13:59.086 --> 14:00.110
Short.

14:08.476 --> 14:10.678
Why don't you quit while you're behind?

14:10.711 --> 14:12.679
I know you know a little
thing about quitting.

14:13.465 --> 14:16.335
I gave this boy a job, and then
you know what he did, George?

14:16.360 --> 14:17.485
Don't tell me he quit.

14:17.518 --> 14:19.353
On Mothers' Day brunch!

14:19.682 --> 14:21.123
That was 15 years ago.

14:21.123 --> 14:22.724
Oh, look ya. You're hot and bothered.

14:22.758 --> 14:24.783
- Just talking trash, baby.
- Don't listen to him, Sam.

14:24.808 --> 14:26.744
- Dunk on him!
- I can't dunk.

14:26.777 --> 14:28.189
Can't grill neither.

14:28.189 --> 14:29.480
Why don't have another
handle of whiskey,

14:29.513 --> 14:30.481
you drunk old bitch?

14:30.514 --> 14:31.637
Whoa.

14:32.269 --> 14:33.717
Hey, Samuel.

14:34.042 --> 14:35.349
An insult is just...

14:35.349 --> 14:36.851
"Is just a." You know what?

14:36.885 --> 14:38.356
I don't care. I friggin' quit.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.956
- Oh, damn.
- Damn.

14:43.452 --> 14:45.371
Whoa. What the...

14:46.386 --> 14:47.505
That was a little harsh.

14:47.505 --> 14:48.891
And I know, because I
used to be harsh myself.

14:48.916 --> 14:50.106
But I'm not anymore.

14:50.762 --> 14:52.309
I'll go talk to him, gang.

14:52.735 --> 14:53.905
Good game, everybody.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.465
That's fun.

15:01.602 --> 15:02.595
Hey, buddy.

15:02.805 --> 15:04.618
I wanna let you know
we're forfeiting the game.

15:05.473 --> 15:06.827
We lost 'cause you kicked the ball.

15:06.852 --> 15:07.782
Yeah.

15:08.476 --> 15:10.044
Your dad was being an asshole.

15:10.078 --> 15:12.816
I know, like, he can't just
ever let anything just be.

15:12.816 --> 15:14.682
He never just, like, let me do my thing.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.616
Like, uh... I mean, I own
my own frickin' company.

15:17.649 --> 15:19.163
No, we both own it.

15:19.163 --> 15:21.231
Yeah, Tim, I mean, but
for my point, can you just...

15:21.265 --> 15:23.000
- Yeah, no, just... both own it.
- Yeah, we both own it.

15:23.371 --> 15:24.539
- I know.
- Thank you.

15:24.572 --> 15:25.473
I mean, like, 15 years ago, you know,

15:25.507 --> 15:26.741
I'm behind the waffle iron,

15:26.774 --> 15:28.676
and, like, he's just,
like, right behind me,

15:28.710 --> 15:30.445
like, "Waffle's overcooked, Sam."

15:30.478 --> 15:31.679
Waffle's overcooked, Sam."

15:31.713 --> 15:33.328
I mean, I just can't focus.

15:33.353 --> 15:35.255
So I finally am just like, you
know, I walked out of there.

15:35.264 --> 15:36.965
I just, like, left, and
then, like, before I left,

15:36.999 --> 15:38.333
like, I turned my back
and, like, I looked back,

15:38.367 --> 15:41.375
I was like, "Happy
Mothers' Day, you mothers."

15:42.212 --> 15:43.438
Did you really say that?

15:43.917 --> 15:45.204
I wish I did so much.

15:45.906 --> 15:47.575
I think your dad's just hard on you,

15:47.600 --> 15:49.345
because he knows you can do anything.

15:51.814 --> 15:52.881
Anything.

15:52.915 --> 15:53.982
I can't dunk, Tim.

15:54.016 --> 15:55.450
I think you can, Sam.

15:55.484 --> 16:00.022
<i>♪ If you're going to love me ♪</i>

16:00.559 --> 16:02.867
- Dad.
- Samuel.

16:03.859 --> 16:05.638
Sorry I kicked the basketball.

16:06.001 --> 16:07.569
Ah, it's okay.

16:07.938 --> 16:09.940
It's just that Duvet family passion.

16:10.175 --> 16:12.043
Makes for us to be great lovers.

16:12.076 --> 16:13.220
I know.

16:13.429 --> 16:14.478
You know, son,

16:15.120 --> 16:16.599
when I give you advice...

16:16.840 --> 16:18.167
Or anybody for that matter...

16:18.903 --> 16:20.870
It's just because I know how to do things,

16:21.084 --> 16:22.147
the best.

16:22.939 --> 16:24.807
Yeah, Dad, just
everything doesn't have to be

16:24.841 --> 16:25.949
a teachable moment.

16:25.949 --> 16:27.243
You know, you really
shouldn't have called

16:27.277 --> 16:29.579
your uncle George an old drunk bitch.

16:29.612 --> 16:30.782
No, I know that.

16:31.547 --> 16:32.902
You know, I know a lot of things.

16:32.902 --> 16:35.271
In fact, some things you didn't
teach me, believe it or not.

16:35.304 --> 16:37.449
Yeah, well, whether I
taught you or not, I know 'em.

16:37.490 --> 16:38.658
That's not the point.

16:38.691 --> 16:39.892
Test me, if you don't believe me.

16:39.925 --> 16:41.293
- I bet I know it.
- Dad.

16:41.327 --> 16:42.395
- Go ahead, test me.
- I bet you I know it.

16:42.428 --> 16:43.675
Dad.

16:44.143 --> 16:47.448
You know, son, you're gonna
be a great grill master.

16:49.749 --> 16:52.282
- I know I am.
- Just not this year.

16:52.352 --> 16:53.718
Yeah, I know, that's fair.

16:56.547 --> 16:57.584
Tim.

16:58.090 --> 17:00.059
Hey, so...

17:00.489 --> 17:03.392
I know we didn't get a lot
of time to talk earlier,

17:03.426 --> 17:06.425
and I hate how we got
off on the wrong foot,

17:06.970 --> 17:09.698
but are you talking shit behind my back?

17:09.732 --> 17:10.732
No.

17:11.315 --> 17:12.705
Why, who said that?

17:13.842 --> 17:15.010
Was it Aunt Lacey?

17:17.616 --> 17:20.883
I may have said that a fly
landed on your potato salad

17:20.915 --> 17:23.965
and the fly complained it was bland.

17:23.965 --> 17:26.090
Then he flew away, got some salt,

17:26.090 --> 17:27.771
used the salt on the potato salad,

17:27.772 --> 17:29.070
so it tasted good to him.

17:29.941 --> 17:31.476
But I now realize that...

17:32.208 --> 17:35.346
although the joke was very
clever, it was also harsh.

17:35.379 --> 17:36.324
Yeah.

17:36.324 --> 17:39.634
And I want to start fresh. I'm sorry.

17:42.071 --> 17:44.773
I'm sorry Sam didn't
introduce me to you sooner.

17:45.079 --> 17:48.249
I guess he knew how intimidated
I would be to meet you

17:48.283 --> 17:50.947
because you're so important
to him, so it's cool.

17:51.119 --> 17:53.154
Sweet of you to say, but
I'm pretty sure it's 'cause

17:53.188 --> 17:55.193
he knew I was gonna be
a big, giant asshole.

17:55.218 --> 17:57.687
You're probably right.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.975
Yes, I am right.

18:00.995 --> 18:02.063
- Friends?
- Yeah.

18:02.096 --> 18:03.576
All right.

18:03.810 --> 18:06.434
Whoo! I'm doing work out there.

18:06.434 --> 18:09.941
Hey! Now, that's a
Duvet filet right there.

18:10.049 --> 18:11.316
It's all yours, Dad.

18:24.232 --> 18:27.736
Fork Bandit!

18:29.424 --> 18:31.092
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

18:31.117 --> 18:33.908
- Hey!
- That crackhead stole my filet!

18:33.908 --> 18:36.144
I'll be god-damned.

18:36.377 --> 18:38.142
I thought I made that shit up.

18:39.102 --> 18:40.314
Whoopsie-daisy.

18:40.645 --> 18:42.865
That ain't apple juice;
that's Hennessy right there.

18:43.498 --> 18:44.800
Taste pretty good though.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.979
- You see that?
- You see his abs?

18:47.010 --> 18:48.754
Yeah, I mean, you only get
abs like that if you do crack.

18:48.754 --> 18:50.044
Yeah, 'cause you're always running,

18:50.044 --> 18:51.021
trying to get the crack.

18:51.021 --> 18:52.122
Yep, running, jumping,
swimming, climbing.

18:52.155 --> 18:53.290
I mean, it's all cardio.

18:53.323 --> 18:55.378
- Yeah, 'cause you gotta get the crack.
- It's the whole goal.

18:55.378 --> 18:56.856
- It's their brass ring, baby.
- It's the main thing.

18:56.856 --> 18:57.991
- It's crack.
- It's crack.

18:58.024 --> 18:59.225
We're all thinking the same thing.

18:59.259 --> 19:00.326
In a way it's admirable,
you know what I mean?

19:00.360 --> 19:01.675
- Sure.
- It's like dedication

19:01.700 --> 19:03.235
- to one thing.
- Sure, man.

19:03.260 --> 19:04.628
You look good too.

19:04.653 --> 19:06.355
You look good. Name me one fat crackhead.

19:06.388 --> 19:08.323
- Lou Dobbs.
- Yeah, that's one.

19:08.357 --> 19:10.056
- Lou Dobbs is a fat crackhead.
- That's the one.

19:10.451 --> 19:12.670
I want to thank y'all for coming

19:12.695 --> 19:14.930
to another good Duvet family reunion!

19:16.373 --> 19:18.950
And I want to take this time
to acknowledge my son, Samuel,

19:19.382 --> 19:21.586
in his inaugural shift as the

19:21.611 --> 19:23.486
new Duvet grill master!

19:25.588 --> 19:27.723
It is a job that I am confident

19:27.757 --> 19:29.250
that he will grow into.

19:29.592 --> 19:32.303
And, son, I just want you to know...

19:34.464 --> 19:35.540
I'm proud of you.

19:36.669 --> 19:37.955
And the man you've become.

19:38.868 --> 19:40.148
I am too.

19:40.803 --> 19:41.938
Proud of you.

19:41.971 --> 19:43.362
And the man you've become.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.107
