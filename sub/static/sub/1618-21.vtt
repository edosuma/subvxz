Constant dose of that

It'll keep him sedated like it did Slade.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.164
No mention on Isabel Rochev's death?

00:13.400 --> 00:15.050
- Not a thing.
- Aah!

00:15.280 --> 00:18.443
- Choose. Choose.
- No! No!

00:19.120 --> 00:21.202
No, Mom.
Mom, what are you doing?

00:21.400 --> 00:24.961

That I will tirelessly pursue justice
on behalf of all Starling citizens...

impartially, to the
best of my abilities.

Ms. Queen.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.723
I wanted to offer my sincere condolences
on your loss.

02:22.920 --> 02:26.686
Your mother was a good woman.
She would have made a wonderful mayor.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.086
Thank you.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.810
I'd love to speak with Oliver.

02:31.320 --> 02:35.041
Well, if you see him, tell him he
missed his own mother's funeral.

02:38.160 --> 02:41.209
No one's seen Oliver for a few days.

- Of course.

Thanks.

03:20.840 --> 03:24.003
I don't even know why I'm crying.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.884
I didn't even like Moira.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.290
Terrible thing to say about
someone after they just died.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.691
In my defense, she was not nice.

03:35.240 --> 03:36.810
She was diabolical.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.410
Not a word you often hear
at someone's funeral.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.683
You're not crying for her, Felicity.
You're crying for Oliver.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.969
Where is he?

03:47.800 --> 03:49.529
How could he not be here?

03:49.720 --> 03:51.085
I don't know.

03:51.280 --> 03:56.161
If Oliver's smart,
he ran back to his island to hide.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.080
But maybe he'll attend your funerals.

I always loved this photograph.

I thought your mother
looked particularly beautiful.

04:20.200 --> 04:21.644
She didn't.

04:21.839 --> 04:24.446
- She thought she looked bug-eyed.
- Heh.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.929
She never said.

How are you holding up?

04:30.400 --> 04:31.447
I'm not.

Your mother gave her life for you, Thea.

04:38.920 --> 04:42.402
She showed you how much she loved you
in ways very few parents ever could.

04:42.600 --> 04:46.730
I know. She died thinking I hated her.

04:47.320 --> 04:50.290
All we ever needed was the truth.

- Slade's.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.730
He was bleeding out. Dying.

Until we decided to give him the Mirakuru.

- Not one of your better ideas.
- What about my idea for you to fix the sub?

06:10.160 --> 06:12.003
- You were in the navy.
- The Russian navy.

not pilot them.

Anatoli, please. I know it's a longshot,
but if we get the sub operational...

06:18.640 --> 06:23.168
we can blow Slade and the Mirakuru out of the
water and get the hell off of this island.

- See what's happening with the case.
- Any leads?

06:48.520 --> 06:51.524
Nope. Wilson's a ghost.
He's not the only one who's disappeared.

It's Sebastian Blood.

There's something that doesn't seem right.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.365
- Laurel...
- Dad, I know what you're thinking.

07:08.560 --> 07:11.040
When I accused him of killing his father,
I was upset.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.489
Just because I had a problem
doesn't mean I was wrong about Sebastian.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.729
Please, don't go down
this road again, okay?

07:17.920 --> 07:21.447
- I mean, what's bringing this on?
- I saw him at the reception.

07:21.640 --> 07:25.690
And it struck me that the only reason that
he's mayor now is because Moira was killed.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.207
- By Slade Wilson.
- What if there's a connection?

07:28.400 --> 07:31.643

Well, I'm the daughter of a cop.

07:33.560 --> 07:37.007
And I know in my gut, Sebastian
is not the man that you think he is.

- Baby, last time...
- I was a drunk.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.442
And you were right not to trust me.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.290
But, Dad...

07:47.760 --> 07:49.762
I need you to trust me now.

This legislation is the first step toward making
Starling City the jewel that it once was.

I'm still getting used
to people calling me that.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.371
- Please take a message.
- The caller insisted.

08:09.560 --> 08:13.042
- He said he's your father.
- That's impossible.

Never mind. I'll take it.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.245
I'm sorry to bother you.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.042
Very well, thank you.

08:30.440 --> 08:34.240
I'm a little busy right now, so if you'll
allow me to call you back, I'll do that.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.886
No need. I'm sure you have
quite a lot of business to attend to.

08:38.120 --> 08:41.090

We're almost out of snake venom.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.491
Seeing Roy like this reminds me of Barry.

09:00.720 --> 09:03.087
And Barry reminds me of S.T.A.R. Labs.

09:03.280 --> 09:09.083
S.T.A.R. Labs reminds me of the Mirakuru cure
that they're working on which we could use.

09:09.280 --> 09:13.365
Yeah, especially since Isabel Rochev
was clearly injected with the stuff.

09:13.560 --> 09:16.211

- There's no way she could be walking...

09:16.400 --> 09:19.404
after being shot dead on
with a 9 mm hollow point.

09:22.120 --> 09:26.967
Left about a dozen messages for Oliver
about Isabel being back. No response.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.731
- You have any luck finding him?
- Tons.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.530
All of it bad.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.929
There's been no activity on his passport,
cell phone...

09:35.120 --> 09:36.201
or bank accounts.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.050
What's left of them anyhow.

09:38.240 --> 09:42.165
And facial recognition hasn't spotted him
at any airport, bus or train station.

09:42.920 --> 09:45.366
Right. What about Sara?

09:45.600 --> 09:47.090
Nothing either.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.841
Dig, people don't go missing
like this unless...

09:50.040 --> 09:51.769
Don't go there, Felicity.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.689
What if she is?

09:55.960 --> 09:57.530
What if Oliver is?

09:57.720 --> 09:59.882
Maybe the reason we can't find him
is because...

10:00.080 --> 10:02.287
He's alive, Felicity.

10:02.480 --> 10:06.485
If he wasn't, Isabel Rochev wouldn't be
so shy about rubbing it in our faces.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.762
I hope you have some way
on how to find him...

10:09.000 --> 10:12.049
because I am running out
of places to look and people to ask.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.650
I know who to ask.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.241
Thanks for agreeing to see us.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.287
Mr. Diggle.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.727
Thought I made it clear
after our last meeting.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.526
As far as A.R.G.U.S. is concerned,
you're out of favors.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.007
I'm not asking for myself, Amanda.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.921
I'm asking for everyone in Starling City.

10:37.120 --> 10:39.248
I need you to find Oliver Queen.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.564

- But that's not even supposed to exist yet.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.849
- I want one.
AMANDA: Let me know what you find.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.931
I don't have time to keep track of your
friends. We deal with more pressing issues.

11:00.120 --> 11:03.442
- You don't understand. Oliver's disappeared.
- Maybe he needs some time.

11:03.680 --> 11:07.366
Or is it possible that the two of you
haven't been looking in the right place?

11:07.600 --> 11:10.763
- Did you try facial recognition?
- Yes, I ran it three times.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.962
Amanda, please.

11:14.280 --> 11:17.363
Slade Wilson has an army of men
just like him.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.322
- How many have been exposed to Mirakuru?
- Enough to lay waste to this city.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.921
- We need to find Oliver now.
- I'll see what I can do.

11:25.240 --> 11:26.969

WOMAN: No.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.400

Okay.

- I'm sorry for your loss, Thea.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.924
Is that why you came here?

11:46.120 --> 11:48.691

Excuse me, I didn't mean to barge in.

was at your front desk, so...

Twice in two days.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

12:39.040 --> 12:42.965
I wish I could say that this was pleasure,
but it's about a case.

me for favors. Guess I have arrived.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.767
isn't willing to testify
as your expert witness.

13:07.960 --> 13:11.282
Exactly. And your predecessor
wasn't willing to lean on him.

13:11.480 --> 13:14.802
Well, lucky for you, I'm
not my predecessor.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.483
You know, this actually reminds me of one I
had during my days as a community organizer.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.011
I was hoping that it would.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.487
I've seen dozens of cases
like this at CNRI.

13:24.560 --> 13:28.246
Well, it's a good thing we both remember
where we came from. I'm happy to help.

Thank you.

I look forward to us working together

Terrific. Could you at least tell me
whose computer you bugged?

14:07.760 --> 14:10.650
