01:10.267 --> 01:13.267
<i>It's okay, I guess.</i>

01:13.300 --> 01:14.934
Why am I being modest?

01:14.968 --> 01:16.267
I'm alone.

01:16.300 --> 01:18.200
It's perfect.

01:21.234 --> 01:22.767
Metropolitan Museum.

01:22.801 --> 01:24.267
I bet you're wondering

01:24.300 --> 01:26.901
how you got a cab
so fast in this rain.

01:26.934 --> 01:29.000
Well, it's because I've been
sitting here admiring

01:29.033 --> 01:30.367
this window display.

01:30.400 --> 01:33.100
You see, I work
here part-time at
this art gallery.

01:33.133 --> 01:33.901
Uh, excuse me,
if you don't mind,

01:33.934 --> 01:34.834
I really don't
feel much like talking.

01:34.868 --> 01:37.000
Just take me
to the Metropolitan, okay?

01:37.033 --> 01:38.801
Oh, I wasn't talking,
I was just...

01:38.834 --> 01:40.133
Hey!

01:40.167 --> 01:42.267
I don't know how to make it
any clearer than that.

01:42.300 --> 01:43.801
Please take me
to the Metropolitan.

01:43.834 --> 01:47.367
Okay. You charmed me into it.

01:50.634 --> 01:52.067
Where you going?

01:52.100 --> 01:54.300
You said
the Metropolitan Museum.

01:54.334 --> 01:56.901
I meant the one in New York.
Why didn't you stay on Madison?

01:56.934 --> 01:59.501
It's shorter this way.
You said you were in a hurry.

01:59.534 --> 02:03.334
You are taking a longer
route than you need to.

02:03.367 --> 02:04.667
It's not any longer.
You know, wait a minute.

02:04.701 --> 02:07.634
Are you accusing me
of jacking up the fare?

02:07.667 --> 02:09.032
No. I'm accusing you of trying.

02:09.067 --> 02:10.501
Unfortunately, I caught you.

02:10.533 --> 02:12.534
Hey, look, Mister. I swear
I'm not trying to cheat you.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.767
Now if you want, I can take you
back where I picked you up,

02:14.801 --> 02:16.801
and we can start over
and I'll take a different route.

02:16.834 --> 02:19.968
Thanks, but I've
seen Jersey.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.133
Okay, out of the cab.

02:24.167 --> 02:26.067
It's pouring rain out there.

02:26.100 --> 02:29.834
The law says you have to take me
wherever I want to go.

02:29.868 --> 02:32.968
There's no way
you can make me leave this cab.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.934
Rape... rape... rape!

02:37.968 --> 02:40.601
You may have a little trouble
getting that story to stick

02:40.634 --> 02:41.767
when the police find out

02:41.801 --> 02:44.434
I'm the National Secretary
for the Gay Liberation Force.

02:48.767 --> 02:52.200
We'll be there
in a few minutes.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.868
Next time be
a little more careful

03:04.901 --> 03:06.234
who you try and rip off.

03:06.267 --> 03:09.033
Look, Mister, I realize
we've had our differences

03:09.067 --> 03:10.767
but you owe me $2.85.

03:10.801 --> 03:14.467
Here's a dollar. I'm not paying
for the scenic route.

03:14.501 --> 03:16.434
Hey, wait a minute, Mister!

03:16.467 --> 03:18.968
Mister, you forgot
your briefcase.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.534
<i>Oh.</i>

03:21.567 --> 03:23.834
<i>Hey, come back here!</i>

03:26.334 --> 03:28.701
He's faster than he looks.

03:34.767 --> 03:36.367
Come on, come on.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.968
Jacks or better.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.567
All right, give me
something good.

03:40.601 --> 03:43.133
Not if I can help it.

03:43.167 --> 03:45.267
Oh, sweet heaven.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.767
Did I tip my hand again?

03:48.801 --> 03:50.868
Only to the trained eye.

03:50.901 --> 03:52.901
Why do I do that
all the time?

03:52.934 --> 03:54.067
Hi, guys.

03:54.100 --> 03:56.067
Hey, Elaine.
What do you say?

03:56.100 --> 03:57.067
I'm not sure.

03:57.100 --> 03:59.234
I just had
a really bad fare today.

03:59.267 --> 04:02.067
Hey, Bobby, she thinks
she had a bad fare.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.434
What happened?

04:03.467 --> 04:07.000
I had the QANTAS koala bear
get carsick in my cab.

04:07.033 --> 04:10.868
And you don't want to know
what a koala bear does

04:10.901 --> 04:13.234
when he gets carsick.

04:13.267 --> 04:15.434
Hey, Alex, could I talk
to you for a moment?

04:15.467 --> 04:16.634
Huh? Yeah, sure.

04:16.666 --> 04:17.634
Deal me out.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.367
I'll sit in for you.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.701
What's wrong?

04:20.733 --> 04:22.367
I feel really strange.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.701
Why? What is it?

04:23.734 --> 04:26.501
Well, you know that art gallery
where I work part-time?

04:26.534 --> 04:30.067
And where they treat me like I
was some sort of receptionist?

04:30.100 --> 04:33.467
Yeah. You mean the place where
you work as a receptionist.

04:33.501 --> 04:35.534
Yeah. Well, they let me design

04:35.567 --> 04:38.634
their new window display
for their new exhibit

04:38.667 --> 04:40.801
and everybody loved what I did.

04:40.834 --> 04:43.868
Now, it's just staring out
on Madison Avenue.

04:43.901 --> 04:46.167
People are even
congratulating me.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.501
No wonder you're down.

04:47.534 --> 04:49.634
You realized
your lifelong ambition.

04:49.667 --> 04:53.634
I know, but it just
doesn't seem like
my life, you know.

04:53.667 --> 04:56.234
Things like this
never happen to me.

04:56.267 --> 04:59.267
That's why I got a little crazy
and I pushed.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.667
I invited them all to a party,
and they accepted.

05:02.701 --> 05:04.467
Oh, hey, sounds
like you're on a roll.

05:04.501 --> 05:06.300
Let me know how it turns out.

05:06.334 --> 05:09.200
I was kind of hoping
that maybe you'd come.

05:09.234 --> 05:11.334
See, I'd really like
to have one person there

05:11.367 --> 05:13.033
that I don't care
about impressing.

05:14.501 --> 05:18.000
How can I turn down
an invitation like that?

05:18.033 --> 05:21.133
Yeah, and one more thing--
when you're at the party

05:21.167 --> 05:25.100
can you remember that nobody
knows that I'm a cab driver?

05:25.133 --> 05:27.067
See, if they knew I
drove a cab at night

05:27.100 --> 05:29.033
they'd find it
a little unusual.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.767
I can't afford
to be unusual yet.

05:31.801 --> 05:34.200
So you actually lie
about your job?

05:34.234 --> 05:37.167
I don't lie.
I fudge.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.601
I'm kind of hoping that
maybe you won't tell them

05:39.634 --> 05:41.200
that you're a cab
driver, either.

05:41.234 --> 05:42.801
Oh, no.
I won't do that, Elaine.

05:42.834 --> 05:43.801
Oh, come on...

05:43.834 --> 05:44.801
Nope!

05:44.834 --> 05:46.133
It's one little thing.

05:46.167 --> 05:48.200
No, it's not
just one little thing.

05:48.234 --> 05:51.000
Hey, sure it is.
Ask anybody.

05:51.033 --> 05:52.234
Hey, guys, can you believe him?

05:52.267 --> 05:53.667
He won't tell
one little lie for me.

05:53.701 --> 05:56.734
The only guy I know that
never told a lie was my dad.

05:56.767 --> 05:58.033
Come on. Never?

05:58.067 --> 05:59.634
Nope. He once told me

05:59.667 --> 06:02.434
"John, remember
your father's words.

06:02.467 --> 06:06.567
"The liar's punishment is not
that he is not believed

06:06.601 --> 06:09.701
but that he cannot believe
anyone else."

06:09.734 --> 06:13.868
John, George Bernard Shaw
said that.

06:13.901 --> 06:15.467
He did?

06:15.501 --> 06:17.501
Your father was
George Bernard Shaw?

06:17.534 --> 06:18.834
Alex, Can we talk

06:18.868 --> 06:20.000
about this?

06:20.033 --> 06:22.167
What do you want him
to lie about?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.367
Maybe I can do it for you.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.100
I'm throwing a party
Friday night.

06:25.133 --> 06:27.901
Hey, it's a little short notice,
but I can make it.

06:27.934 --> 06:29.567
Why are you having
a party on Friday night?

06:29.601 --> 06:31.234
We're all going
to miss a lot of business.

06:31.267 --> 06:32.801
Well, actually guys,
this is a party I'm throwing

06:32.834 --> 06:35.200
for the people
at my art gallery.

06:35.234 --> 06:36.868
Who cares, the more,
the merrier. Right?

06:36.901 --> 06:38.667
They don't understand.

06:38.701 --> 06:40.033
Oh, I get it.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.267
We're not invited.

06:43.267 --> 06:45.701
How come we can't go
to the party too?

06:45.734 --> 06:47.167
'Cause we're
nobodies.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.601
We're stupid, ignorant,
low-life cabbies.

06:50.634 --> 06:52.667
Oh.

06:52.701 --> 06:54.667
What do you think, Latka?

06:54.701 --> 06:58.400
( <i>speaking native tongue</i> )

06:58.434 --> 07:01.200
Latka, in English.

07:01.234 --> 07:05.868
If they don't come,
I don't come.

07:05.901 --> 07:08.033
I'm sorry.
They can't come.

07:08.067 --> 07:11.267
All right,
then I come without them.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.067
All right! All right!

07:13.100 --> 07:14.234
You can come.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.400
If it means
that much to you.

07:16.434 --> 07:18.300
If it doesn't matter to you
that you screw me up

07:18.334 --> 07:20.067
with my bosses or ruin
the one chance I have

07:20.100 --> 07:22.234
to send my kids
to a decent school

07:22.267 --> 07:24.701
then, by all means,
just come to my party.

07:24.734 --> 07:26.634
What's the address?

07:26.667 --> 07:28.434
Hey, you come
with me.

07:28.467 --> 07:29.968
I know where it is.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.767
Thank you very much.

07:31.801 --> 07:33.400
Let's go get
something to eat,

07:33.434 --> 07:35.300
and I'll tell you
about my outfit.

07:35.334 --> 07:37.934
Hey, Elaine,
hey, don't worry about us.

07:37.968 --> 07:40.868
Nobody's gonna know
we're taxicab drivers.

07:40.901 --> 07:42.467
Come on. We'll cover it up.
All right?

07:42.501 --> 07:43.467
Okay.

07:43.501 --> 07:44.834
All right.

07:44.868 --> 07:46.634
See you later, Alex.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.167
Ahem!

07:48.200 --> 07:49.400
You're in luck.

07:49.434 --> 07:52.000
Looks like you got a chance to
nab Louie for your guest list.

07:52.033 --> 07:54.334
Yeah, I might give your party
a tumble.

07:54.367 --> 07:56.167
Perhaps some of those
art-world cuties

07:56.200 --> 08:00.767
might want me to pose for them
<i>au naturel.</i>

08:00.801 --> 08:02.968
Louie, you're not invited.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.033
What do you mean?

08:04.067 --> 08:05.567
I mean if you're even seen

08:05.601 --> 08:08.133
in the vicinity
of my apartment Friday night

08:08.167 --> 08:09.801
I'll have you arrested.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.667
Oh, <i>really</i> not invited.

08:11.701 --> 08:14.100
Okay. Who needs you?

08:14.133 --> 08:17.801
Come on let's get this garage
back to normal!

08:17.834 --> 08:21.267
Hey, Latka! You finish cleaning
that cab yet?

08:23.934 --> 08:25.300
Phew!

08:25.334 --> 08:29.634
Who drive a sick koala bear?

08:36.000 --> 08:37.601
( <i>doorbell ringing</i> )

08:37.634 --> 08:38.634
Alex?

08:38.667 --> 08:39.701
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:39.734 --> 08:40.868
( <i>Sighs</i> )

08:40.900 --> 08:42.167
Hi.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.167
Hi.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.167
Did I get the wrong night?

08:45.200 --> 08:46.667
No, this is the night.

08:46.701 --> 08:48.634
Well, don't bother
to introduce me.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.133
I'll just mingle.

08:50.167 --> 08:51.467
How are you?

08:51.501 --> 08:52.701
I played a little
trick on you, Alex.
Oh?

08:52.734 --> 08:55.467
I told you the wrong time
so that you'd get here early.

08:55.501 --> 08:56.868
Great trick. Why?

08:56.901 --> 08:58.567
Well, see,
you're doing me a favor.

08:58.601 --> 09:01.133
Now that you're here,
no one has to go through

09:01.167 --> 09:03.167
the embarrassment
of arriving first.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.701
You know how
uncomfortable
that can be.

09:08.601 --> 09:10.334
I can only imagine.

09:10.367 --> 09:13.400
Besides, I'm a little
insecure about this party

09:13.434 --> 09:14.767
and I wanted someone

09:14.801 --> 09:17.167
to tell me
how nice the place looks.

09:20.634 --> 09:21.734
Well, you can start anytime.

09:21.767 --> 09:22.834
Oh, yes.

09:22.868 --> 09:24.000
It looks great.

09:24.033 --> 09:25.334
No, it really does.

09:25.367 --> 09:26.334
I like that.

09:26.367 --> 09:27.801
Oh, and I like that.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.667
And I really like this.

09:29.701 --> 09:31.067
Thanks.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.200
You know, this was hard.

09:32.234 --> 09:33.634
I had to borrow some furniture

09:33.667 --> 09:35.200
and move the kids' beds
upstairs.

09:35.234 --> 09:38.133
I'm really knocking myself out
for this party.

09:38.167 --> 09:39.901
But I think I'm going to be okay

09:39.934 --> 09:41.968
as long as my cheese puffs
are a hit.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Oh...

09:46.000 --> 09:47.067
Delicious.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.300
Take it from a puff man.

09:51.334 --> 09:55.300
So, is there anything
I've overlooked?

09:55.334 --> 09:58.701
Oh, uh... persons.

09:58.734 --> 10:00.801
They're coming. Anything else?

10:00.834 --> 10:03.200
Something for persons to drink.

10:03.234 --> 10:04.801
That's a little
bit of a problem.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.801
You see, I used
a discount liquor store.

10:06.834 --> 10:09.367
I don't want anyone
to see the labels.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.200
They're kind
of off-brands.

10:11.234 --> 10:12.133
Like what?

10:12.167 --> 10:15.133
Ever heard of Betty's vodka?

10:18.334 --> 10:20.067
Gentlemen never tell.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.934
Can I make a suggestion?

10:21.968 --> 10:24.300
Why don't you put the stuff
in a punch bowl

10:24.334 --> 10:25.968
and add ginger ale
and juices.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.133
Oh, that's a great idea.

10:27.167 --> 10:28.033
There you go.

10:28.067 --> 10:31.801
You know, I never
even thought about mixing.

10:31.834 --> 10:34.734
Oh... I just hope I got
enough champagne.

10:34.767 --> 10:36.734
How much did you get?

10:36.767 --> 10:38.501
12 Cans.

10:38.534 --> 10:41.167
Canned champagne?

10:41.200 --> 10:43.033
I guess for those macho gourmets

10:43.067 --> 10:46.067
who like to crush
something after a sip.

10:46.100 --> 10:47.400
( <i>doorbell ringing</i> )

10:47.434 --> 10:49.434
Oh, Alex, this is it!

10:49.467 --> 10:52.000
Now, now,
just relax. Relax.

10:52.033 --> 10:54.033
They're just people.

11:03.367 --> 11:06.033
There's always the exception
to the rule.

11:06.067 --> 11:07.701
Party time for Latka?

11:07.734 --> 11:09.868
Not until you
take off those overalls.

11:09.901 --> 11:12.100
Oh, this is good party.

11:12.133 --> 11:13.801
No! No! Latka!

11:13.834 --> 11:17.300
You've got to change
into nicer clothes.

11:17.334 --> 11:19.634
Oh...

11:19.667 --> 11:21.968
( <i>speaking native tongue</i> )

11:22.033 --> 11:23.033
...in truck...

11:23.067 --> 11:24.133
( <i>speaking native tongue</i> )

11:27.434 --> 11:29.467
You think
it's all right

11:29.501 --> 11:31.167
to have him here?

11:31.200 --> 11:33.734
Are you kidding? He's my pick
for the life of the party.

11:33.767 --> 11:37.701
Oh, Alex, are you sure
everything looks okay?

11:37.734 --> 11:39.634
Elaine, believe me.
The apartment looks wonderful.

11:39.667 --> 11:40.968
Now will you just relax.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.334
Okay. Okay.

11:42.367 --> 11:44.968
Hey, you know, you may not
believe this, but I've really

11:45.000 --> 11:46.734
calmed down a lot
since you got here.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.534
Yeah, I can see that.

11:48.567 --> 11:52.634
Oh, um, but could I just ask you
one more little favor?

11:52.667 --> 11:54.067
Yep.

11:54.100 --> 11:55.767
If you tell these people
that  you're a cab driver

11:55.801 --> 11:59.234
they'll ask how you know me,
and you'll give everything away.

11:59.267 --> 12:03.434
Elaine, is that the real reason
you got me over here early? Huh?

12:03.467 --> 12:04.901
Oh, come on.
How could you do that?

12:04.934 --> 12:06.367
How could you do
a thing like that?

12:06.400 --> 12:08.100
Come on, Alex.
This is a cocktail party.

12:08.133 --> 12:09.801
Oh, for crying out loud.

12:09.834 --> 12:11.100
Why do you have to come on

12:11.133 --> 12:13.167
so super-ethical anyway?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.200
I am not ethical,
Elaine.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.400
I am... chicken.

12:16.434 --> 12:17.834
I don't lie for
the simple reason

12:17.868 --> 12:19.133
I am afraid
of getting caught.

12:19.167 --> 12:20.601
There's nothing
more embarrassing

12:20.634 --> 12:21.868
than getting caught
in a lie.

12:21.901 --> 12:23.434
Besides, if you don't lie

12:23.467 --> 12:26.000
you don't have to try to
remember what you said.

12:26.033 --> 12:27.601
Okay. Okay.

12:27.634 --> 12:30.734
If it happens,
it happens.

12:30.767 --> 12:32.267
All right. All right.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.100
I'm not going to lie

12:34.133 --> 12:37.634
but I won't say anything
if I'm not asked. Okay?

12:37.667 --> 12:39.200
Okay. Thanks.

12:39.234 --> 12:40.434
Mm-hmm.

12:40.467 --> 12:42.501
( <i>doorbell ringing</i> )

12:50.234 --> 12:52.400
Party overalls.

12:52.434 --> 12:53.601
Now you're talking.

12:53.634 --> 12:54.868
Neat.

12:54.901 --> 12:57.067
Latka learn

12:57.100 --> 12:59.200
party talk.

12:59.234 --> 13:00.701
Yeah.

13:00.734 --> 13:03.200
"What are you drinking?

13:03.234 --> 13:07.501
"Aren't there a lot
of phonies here?

13:07.534 --> 13:12.033
"Let's go to my place.

13:12.067 --> 13:15.133
Was it good
for you?"

13:17.868 --> 13:19.434
You've been teaching him.

13:19.467 --> 13:22.667
Not me. I was going to ask
for a copy myself.

13:45.567 --> 13:46.734
Looks like your
party's a hit, Elaine.

13:46.767 --> 13:48.400
Yeah, so far, so good.

13:48.434 --> 13:50.601
I'm a little worried
about the guys.

13:50.634 --> 13:52.601
They don't seem
to be mingling.

13:52.634 --> 13:54.534
Yeah, only
with each other.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.334
Hey, it's your turn, Tony.
How did <i>your</i> parents meet?

13:57.367 --> 13:58.434
It was in Italy...

13:58.467 --> 14:00.000
Come on, you guys.

14:00.033 --> 14:02.334
I want you to meet
some people.

14:02.367 --> 14:04.133
That's okay,
we already have.

14:04.167 --> 14:07.133
Yeah, I think we're
just going to shove off.

14:07.167 --> 14:08.367
Ah, why?

14:08.400 --> 14:09.767
Because, we don't fit in.

14:09.801 --> 14:11.367
We're the kind of guys who
like to have fun.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.968
Thanks a lot, Elaine.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.167
Bye-bye.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.567
Take it easy, Alex.

14:15.601 --> 14:16.767
Great punch.

14:16.801 --> 14:18.000
Bye.

14:22.200 --> 14:23.400
Stop envying them.

14:26.067 --> 14:27.734
Mrs. Hazeltine?

14:27.767 --> 14:29.367
Oh. Thank you, Elaine.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.567
These are delicious.

14:30.601 --> 14:32.033
Thank you.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.567
I love your paintings.

14:33.601 --> 14:34.634
Really?

14:34.667 --> 14:36.501
But I don't
recognize the artist.

14:36.534 --> 14:39.234
As a matter of fact,
I live with the artist.

14:39.267 --> 14:40.300
You what?

14:40.334 --> 14:41.300
It's my daughter.

14:41.334 --> 14:42.334
Oh.

14:42.367 --> 14:43.534
Except the one

14:43.567 --> 14:44.934
of the bunny rabbit.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.133
That was done
by my ex-husband.

14:47.167 --> 14:49.934
We've been talking
about the new exhibit

14:49.968 --> 14:51.934
at the Museum of Modern Art.

14:51.968 --> 14:53.367
Have you seen it?

14:53.400 --> 14:54.834
Oh, yes, I have. Twice.

14:54.868 --> 14:56.701
Did you like
the Magritte drawings?

14:56.734 --> 14:57.767
Oh. Um...

14:57.801 --> 14:59.868
would you excuse me
for a moment?

14:59.901 --> 15:02.067
There's something I've
got to take care of.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.367
All right.

15:04.701 --> 15:07.534
Alex... one of the biggest art
dealers in New York

15:07.567 --> 15:09.667
just asked my opinion
of an exhibit.

15:09.701 --> 15:10.801
Oh, terrific.

15:10.834 --> 15:11.834
Give it.

15:11.868 --> 15:12.801
Oh.

15:12.834 --> 15:14.400
Thank you very much.

15:14.434 --> 15:15.834
Going to go now.

15:15.868 --> 15:18.367
Well, I'm glad
you could come, Latka.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.567
Bye-bye.

15:19.601 --> 15:20.767
Bye.

15:20.801 --> 15:24.167
Eh, aren't there
a lot of phonies here?

15:24.200 --> 15:25.601
Let's go to my place.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.400
For you.

15:32.734 --> 15:35.067
Come on. Come on.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.300
It must be the way he says it.

15:44.334 --> 15:46.367
Boy, this champagne
is terrific, huh?

15:46.400 --> 15:48.033
I wonder what kind it is.

15:49.634 --> 15:52.234
Del Monte.

15:52.267 --> 15:54.234
My name is Paul.

15:54.267 --> 15:56.067
I write for <i>Art News.</i>

15:56.100 --> 15:58.200
Oh, I'm Alex.

15:58.234 --> 15:59.601
What do you do, Alex?

15:59.634 --> 16:02.467
Oh, this and that.

16:02.501 --> 16:03.868
Sounds interesting.

16:03.901 --> 16:06.000
This and that <i>what?</i>

16:06.033 --> 16:07.667
I, uh...

16:07.701 --> 16:09.801
sort of free-lance.

16:09.834 --> 16:12.300
Oh, you're a free-lance painter.

16:12.334 --> 16:13.501
No.

16:13.534 --> 16:14.701
Alex.

16:14.734 --> 16:18.000
Okay, Elaine, you win.

16:18.033 --> 16:20.200
I put out oil fires.

16:21.901 --> 16:23.100
I beg your pardon?

16:23.133 --> 16:25.100
When an oil well
catches on fire

16:25.133 --> 16:26.300
they call me in to put it out.

16:26.334 --> 16:27.501
Sounds dangerous.

16:27.534 --> 16:29.901
Yeah, well, I only get
the easy ones.

16:29.934 --> 16:32.767
You see, the main thing that got
me into this line of work...

16:32.801 --> 16:35.501
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just reflex.

16:35.534 --> 16:37.634
You see, uh...

16:37.667 --> 16:39.033
Actually, the thing that
pulled me

16:39.067 --> 16:41.868
into being
an oil-fire putter-outer

16:41.901 --> 16:43.868
is that it never gets boring.

16:43.901 --> 16:46.267
Nope. All holocausts
may look alike

16:46.300 --> 16:49.467
but each one has
a personality all its own.

16:49.501 --> 16:52.901
If you'll excuse me, I'd like to
freshen my drink for a moment,

16:52.934 --> 16:54.133
I'll be right back.

16:56.434 --> 16:57.534
Thanks, Alex.

16:57.567 --> 16:59.667
I know that wasn't
easy for you.

16:59.701 --> 17:01.400
Easier than I thought.

17:01.434 --> 17:03.801
It's just your luck for
this party I watched

17:03.834 --> 17:05.032
<i>Search for Adventure.</i>

17:05.067 --> 17:07.968
I've never been the life of a
party before like this.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.434
I sort of like fudging.

17:11.032 --> 17:12.534
Do you really fight fires?

17:12.567 --> 17:13.733
Oh, yes, yes.

17:13.767 --> 17:14.968
Yes, yes.

17:15.901 --> 17:19.567
What is the biggest
fire you ever put out?

17:19.601 --> 17:23.701
Well, actually, I had
12 wells go up at one time.

17:23.733 --> 17:26.000
I'm Rita.

17:26.032 --> 17:27.567
I'm Alex.

17:29.467 --> 17:32.400
Aren't there a lot
of phonies here?

17:38.434 --> 17:39.601
I know.

17:39.634 --> 17:42.534
Do you mind if I say
something candid?

17:42.567 --> 17:44.934
If it's about the champagne,
I had nothing to do with it.

17:44.968 --> 17:47.234
I find you <i>very</i> attractive.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.267
I appreciate your candor.

17:49.300 --> 17:52.167
I don't usually say
things like that to guys.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.667
I hope you don't mind.

17:53.701 --> 17:55.868
Well, I'll forgive you
if you'll forgive

17:55.901 --> 17:58.634
the cheer I'm about
to deafen you with.

18:00.667 --> 18:03.267
Have dinner with me
after the party.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.767
At least.

18:04.801 --> 18:06.767
A <i>brief</i> dinner.

18:06.801 --> 18:09.033
( <i>doorbell ringing</i> )

18:19.934 --> 18:21.901
Alex...
that guy is the same guy

18:21.934 --> 18:23.501
I had the fight with in front of
the gallery the other night.

18:23.534 --> 18:24.767
Really? That's nice.

18:24.801 --> 18:25.934
In my cab.

18:25.968 --> 18:28.133
Elaine, please.

18:28.167 --> 18:31.334
He must be a friend
of Mrs. Hazeltine's.

18:31.367 --> 18:33.000
Oh, no. No.

18:33.033 --> 18:34.734
Elaine, I'd like you

18:34.767 --> 18:37.567
to meet my very dear friend,
James Broderick.

18:37.601 --> 18:39.133
How do you do?

18:39.167 --> 18:40.934
We've met.

18:40.968 --> 18:41.667
We have?

18:41.701 --> 18:43.067
Haven't we?

18:43.100 --> 18:45.067
I'm sorry, I
don't place you.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.367
Oh.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.667
My mistake.

18:47.701 --> 18:48.934
Well, I'm so glad
that you've come.

18:48.968 --> 18:52.000
Would you help yourself
to some refreshments?

18:52.033 --> 18:53.234
Thank you.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.434
He didn't recognize me.

18:56.467 --> 18:57.701
That's terrific.

18:57.734 --> 18:59.501
He looked right
into my face

18:59.534 --> 19:01.100
and there was
no sign of recognition.

19:01.133 --> 19:02.501
He didn't know me.
He didn't know me?

19:02.534 --> 19:04.734
Elaine, what
are you doing?

19:04.767 --> 19:06.100
I'll never
forget him. Never.

19:06.133 --> 19:07.601
I mean, we really had a fight.

19:07.634 --> 19:09.934
I can't believe
he looked through me like that.

19:09.968 --> 19:12.334
I was nothing to him,
just a faceless cab driver.

19:12.367 --> 19:13.467
<i>Elaine, please.</i>

19:13.501 --> 19:14.667
He needs a reminder.

19:14.701 --> 19:16.334
Elaine, now, a lot of people
aren't happy

19:16.367 --> 19:18.133
unless they screw things up
that are really going well.

19:18.167 --> 19:19.868
Now, this is a very nice party.

19:19.901 --> 19:22.267
I mean, these people are
very important to you.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.334
I'm even trying to enjoy myself.

19:24.367 --> 19:27.634
Elaine, why don't you
just forget it, hmm?

19:27.667 --> 19:30.033
Elaine. Take a deep breath.

19:31.901 --> 19:33.100
Take a deeper one.

19:35.100 --> 19:36.334
That's my girl.

19:36.367 --> 19:37.534
Thanks.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.834
So you don't
remember me, huh?!

19:43.200 --> 19:44.367
Sure, I do.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.534
I just met you
30 seconds ago.

19:46.567 --> 19:49.367
I picked you up in my taxi

19:49.400 --> 19:51.534
four nights ago
on Madison Avenue.

19:51.567 --> 19:53.567
She's a taxi driver.

20:00.534 --> 20:02.501
And you accused me
of trying

20:02.534 --> 20:04.234
to cheat you on a fare.

20:04.267 --> 20:05.334
That was you?

20:05.367 --> 20:06.567
That was me.

20:06.601 --> 20:09.834
How can you yell into a face
for 15 minutes

20:09.868 --> 20:11.734
and then forget the face you
yelled into?

20:11.767 --> 20:13.367
Do you really mean it?

20:13.400 --> 20:14.968
You're a cab driver?

20:15.033 --> 20:16.200
Yes, I am.

20:16.234 --> 20:18.567
I was right.

20:18.601 --> 20:21.868
I find that rather
hard to believe.

20:21.901 --> 20:23.501
Well, I am.

20:23.534 --> 20:25.234
Alex and I are
both cab drivers.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.934
What do <i>you</i> do
for a living?

20:32.968 --> 20:34.200
Excuse me.

20:40.100 --> 20:41.267
Alex?

20:41.300 --> 20:43.200
Don't talk
to me, Elaine.

20:43.234 --> 20:46.534
You're going to stay here
till we're friends again.

20:46.567 --> 20:49.601
Then we'll both
grow old together.

20:49.634 --> 20:51.801
Well, if it means
anything to you

20:51.834 --> 20:52.834
I just want you to know

20:52.868 --> 20:54.601
that I will always be grateful
that you taught me

20:54.634 --> 20:56.868
to simply tell the truth.
Elaine.

20:56.901 --> 20:59.267
I only wish the truth
worked for you too.

20:59.300 --> 21:02.734
I'm not going
to talk to you about it.

21:02.767 --> 21:04.868
At least yell at me.

21:04.901 --> 21:06.834
That will make
you feel better.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.801
You're not going
to talk about it.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.200
Nope. I'm just
going to sit here

21:13.234 --> 21:14.934
and drink your champagne.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.067
What I don't
understand is--

21:23.100 --> 21:25.167
what's the big deal
about it?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.667
I'll tell you what's the big
deal about it.

21:26.701 --> 21:30.100
A man waits all his life
for a woman like that.

21:30.133 --> 21:32.000
What's so great about her?

21:32.033 --> 21:33.801
What's so great about <i>her?</i>

21:33.834 --> 21:37.734
She's the kind of woman
only firefighters get.

21:37.767 --> 21:39.734
She just walks up to you

21:39.767 --> 21:42.934
looks you straight
in the eye and says--

21:42.968 --> 21:45.334
"Do you mind
if I say something candid?

21:45.367 --> 21:46.934
"I find you
very attractive.

21:46.968 --> 21:49.334
"I don't usually
say things like that.

21:49.367 --> 21:52.267
I hope you don't mind."

21:52.300 --> 21:54.667
It sounded better
when she said it.

21:54.701 --> 21:56.701
It sounded like
once in a lifetime

21:56.734 --> 21:58.100
when <i>she</i> said it.

21:58.133 --> 22:01.267
It sounded terrible
when she stopped saying it.

22:01.300 --> 22:02.534
You know, I have a feeling

22:02.567 --> 22:04.534
you're gonna hear
from her again.

22:04.567 --> 22:08.267
Yeah, I could sort of tell
from the way she acted
towards the end.

22:08.300 --> 22:12.133
She called me garbage.

22:12.167 --> 22:13.367
There you go.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.434
Hey, you know how women
feel about garbage.

22:16.467 --> 22:17.834
Always wondering if what

22:17.868 --> 22:19.834
you've thrown out was important

22:19.868 --> 22:21.767
so you start digging through it
until you find it again.

22:21.801 --> 22:24.167
Elaine, don't try to make me
feel better, okay?

22:24.200 --> 22:26.267
Let's just go back
to my sitting here

22:26.300 --> 22:28.534
and you looking at me...
feeling awful.

22:30.667 --> 22:35.901
She spit on my shoes.

22:35.934 --> 22:37.834
What I really feel bad about

22:37.868 --> 22:40.901
is how great everything
turned out for me...

22:40.934 --> 22:43.968
people admiring the way
I hold down two jobs

22:44.000 --> 22:45.367
to support my family.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.834
They're saying how great I am,
you know

22:47.868 --> 22:50.701
and how terrific
and open and honest I am

22:50.734 --> 22:52.767
for telling people
I'm a cab driver.

22:52.801 --> 22:55.834
Even that fare turned out
to be a great guy

22:55.868 --> 22:57.400
forcing that tip on me?

22:57.434 --> 23:00.033
This is going
to pay for the party.

23:00.067 --> 23:01.968
I'm leaving.

23:02.033 --> 23:03.400
Alex, please forgive me.

23:03.434 --> 23:07.701
I can't believe
you won't forgive me.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.734
I'll die if you don't
forgive me.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.267
Oh, Alex.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.300
You're maybe my best friend.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.234
I forgive you.

23:30.767 --> 23:31.934
You mean it?

23:31.968 --> 23:33.868
I don't know with
those wild stories

23:33.901 --> 23:35.868
you're telling,
you know?

23:35.901 --> 23:37.100
Yes, I mean it.

23:37.133 --> 23:39.501
From now on, I'm going
to have to go back

23:39.534 --> 23:41.734
to telling the truth,
only the truth.

23:43.601 --> 23:46.567
Thank you for inviting me
to your party, Elaine.

23:46.601 --> 23:47.801
I had a wonderful time.

23:57.634 --> 24:00.567
( <i>theme music playing</i> )

24:24.667 --> 24:26.434
WOMAN:
Night, Mr. Walters.
