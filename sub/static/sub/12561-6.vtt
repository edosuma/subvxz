00:00.872 --> 00:02.205
<i>- Previously on royal pains...</i>

00:02.206 --> 00:03.840
- You let a billionaire
hospital trustee die

00:03.841 --> 00:05.508
To save some kid
off the street.

00:05.509 --> 00:07.366
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:07.367 --> 00:08.807
- This trip is gonna
get you back on your feet.

00:08.808 --> 00:10.820
- What trip?
- To the hamptons.

00:10.821 --> 00:13.820
- I can't believe
you didn't tell me

00:13.821 --> 00:15.914
That dad took all our money.

00:15.915 --> 00:17.741
You should go.
- It's not what evan wants.

00:17.742 --> 00:19.072
- It's what I want.
- At some point,

00:19.073 --> 00:20.767
You're gonna
have to forgive him.

00:20.768 --> 00:23.560
- At some point, you're gonna
have to realize I won't.

00:23.561 --> 00:25.956
- My dad's not here right now.
I'm tucker bryant.

00:25.957 --> 00:27.818
- Hey, I got you, I got you.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.317
- Tucker? Oh, my god.

00:29.318 --> 00:31.147
- Why didn't you tell me
you were a hemophiliac?

00:31.148 --> 00:33.080
- He slipped
rushing down the stairs.

00:33.081 --> 00:35.244
We had an argument.
Tucker didn't want me to drink.

00:35.245 --> 00:37.608
- If you don't enter
a structured rehab,

00:37.609 --> 00:39.572
Chances are
you're gonna relapse.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.105
- Hank was right.

00:41.106 --> 00:43.538
Didn't dad fire you?
- He did.

00:43.539 --> 00:45.604
From being your doctor.

00:45.605 --> 00:48.502
Not from being your friend.

01:00.603 --> 01:03.202
- I'm gonna miss you
so much, tucker.

01:03.203 --> 01:05.369
- I'm gonna miss you too.

01:05.370 --> 01:07.103
- I'll tell them
I'm coming down with

01:07.104 --> 01:09.469
An inflammatory
autoimmune disorder.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.903
- Libby...

01:10.904 --> 01:13.303
- Other counselors
can cover for me.

01:13.304 --> 01:16.103
- So my family drama
just went shakespearean.

01:16.104 --> 01:18.669
Big deal.
- You need a support structure.

01:18.670 --> 01:20.902
- Well, oliver's
back from school.

01:20.903 --> 01:22.669
Finally.
He'll keep me occupied.

01:22.670 --> 01:24.669
- This is a guy who had to
stay for summer school

01:24.670 --> 01:26.136
Or flunk out?

01:26.137 --> 01:28.870
- Don't be so judgmental.
He's like family.

01:28.871 --> 01:30.937
But nothing like my family.

01:30.938 --> 01:33.071
Come on. You're stalling.
- No.

01:33.072 --> 01:34.105
- It's time.
- No!

01:34.106 --> 01:35.705
- Yeah.

01:35.706 --> 01:38.606
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:43.708 --> 01:46.075
Off she goes.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.110
- Oh!

01:50.111 --> 01:52.043
Ha ha!

02:18.087 --> 02:19.886
- Hey, man.

02:20.187 --> 02:23.455
- How was the party last night?
- Awesome.

02:23.456 --> 02:24.956
If you weren't married,

02:24.957 --> 02:27.424
We could have rolled together
in that hot ride.

02:27.425 --> 02:29.492
I thought you crashed it.
- I did. This is version 2.0.

02:29.493 --> 02:31.425
- Oh. Let's see if you
learned how to drive it.

02:31.426 --> 02:33.792
I will race you to the vats.

02:33.793 --> 02:36.327
- Ha. Are you going
to an accredited university

02:36.328 --> 02:37.594
Out in cali?

02:37.595 --> 02:39.394
Because here
on the east coast,

02:39.395 --> 02:43.129
We know that a ferrari
can probably beat a forklift

02:43.130 --> 02:45.630
Without leaving first gear.
- Let's make it interesting.

02:45.631 --> 02:47.264
- Name the stakes.

02:47.265 --> 02:49.566
- Whoever gets there last
has to get a bad haircut!

02:49.567 --> 02:52.768
The only problem is
you already lost that bet!

02:52.769 --> 02:54.236
- Ha ha!

02:54.237 --> 02:56.303
You're ridiculous.

02:56.304 --> 02:58.438
- Whoo! Yeah!

02:58.439 --> 03:01.541
♪ ba ba da ba da
buh buh buh buh ♪

03:01.542 --> 03:04.243
Come on, baby.
We got it.

03:04.244 --> 03:05.244
We got it.

03:05.245 --> 03:09.247
oh...Oh...

03:11.616 --> 03:14.384
- Ollie?

03:14.385 --> 03:16.252
Oliver?

03:16.253 --> 03:18.287
Oliver!

03:22.058 --> 03:24.492
Ollie!

03:29.797 --> 03:31.430
What just happened?

03:31.431 --> 03:33.230
- I...Don't know.

03:33.231 --> 03:37.530
I...Just couldn't keep
my eyes open.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.071
- Okay.

03:51.072 --> 03:52.605
I know.

03:52.606 --> 03:55.641
I'm late.

03:55.642 --> 03:57.209
Yes. I'm late.

03:57.210 --> 03:59.811
You're angry...But you're
not gonna stay that way.

03:59.812 --> 04:02.413
Not after you have
that black ham and brie sandwich

04:02.414 --> 04:04.650
You know what they put on it
just for me?

04:04.651 --> 04:06.786
- What?
- Huh? A little apricot relish.

04:06.787 --> 04:08.287
To die.

04:08.288 --> 04:10.623
- It figures that you'd have
this town wired already, dad.

04:10.624 --> 04:12.659
- Well, I like this place.

04:12.660 --> 04:14.294
- I thought you were staying
with newberg.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.795
- Living with her? No.

04:15.796 --> 04:18.331
We're keeping it young,
fresh, you know?

04:18.332 --> 04:20.632
And, uh, physically exotic.
- Thank you for that, dad.

04:20.634 --> 04:22.569
I don't have to sleep
at night anyway,

04:22.570 --> 04:24.070
So good, good.

04:24.071 --> 04:25.471
- All rit, now,
e's gone for the weekend.

04:25.472 --> 04:27.673
When she comes back,
we're gonna have a barbecu

04:27.674 --> 04:29.709
If you want,
you can invite hank.

04:29.710 --> 04:32.378
- He keeps pretty busy
with work, dad.

04:32.379 --> 04:34.713
- E-every day...
Of the whole summer?

04:34.714 --> 04:37.950
- Would you buy a hunger strike?

04:37.951 --> 04:40.019
He just won't come.

04:40.020 --> 04:42.154
- And you know that
without asking.

04:42.155 --> 04:44.323
- I just know
how you guys left it

04:44.324 --> 04:46.892
Last time you saw each other
at the restaurant, right?

04:46.893 --> 04:48.827
Nothing's anged since then,
and...

04:48.828 --> 04:50.495
I'm sorry.
- No, no.

04:50.496 --> 04:52.297
There's nothing
anybody can do about it.

04:52.298 --> 04:53.899
I mean,
you can't just magally

04:53.900 --> 04:56.067
Make something go back
to the way it wa you know?

04:56.068 --> 04:58.603
- Right.

05:01.006 --> 05:03.975
- You ready?
- For what?

05:03.976 --> 05:06.778
- Feast your eyes.

05:06.779 --> 05:09.013
- Oh, my god!

05:09.014 --> 05:10.514
That was the best day ever.
- Yeah.

05:10.515 --> 05:12.683
I thought you should have it.
- Really?

05:12.684 --> 05:14.485
- Yeah.
You get a little frame,

05:14.486 --> 05:16.954
Put it rig up on the wall.

05:18.690 --> 05:23.060
- So that hank could see it?

05:23.061 --> 05:25.963
I can't do this middleman act
anymore between you guys.

05:25.964 --> 05:27.698
- All right, so I thought
maybe it'd be great

05:27.699 --> 05:31.568
If he remembered a time when
we didn't need a middleman.

05:31.569 --> 05:33.336
Right now we don't need
a middleman.

05:33.337 --> 05:35.105
Just a good appetite.
Come on.

05:37.341 --> 05:39.709
Two black ham.

05:52.691 --> 05:53.691
- Hi.

05:53.692 --> 05:54.692
- Is there someone
who might know

05:54.693 --> 05:55.693
Where tucker bryt is?

05:55.694 --> 05:56.860
- He's right up there.

06:04.169 --> 06:06.103
- Excuse me.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.605
Hi. Do you know where
I can find tucker bryant?

06:08.606 --> 06:09.840
- Uh, find oliveambrose,

06:09.841 --> 06:11.375
And that's tucker
attached to his hip.

06:11.376 --> 06:12.743
You the doctor?
- Yeah.

06:12.744 --> 06:14.544
- This way.
Thank god he's all right.

06:14.545 --> 06:16.981
- Yeah. Thank you.

06:21.986 --> 06:24.054
- Are you all right?

06:24.055 --> 06:25.455
- Oh. Uh...Yeah.

06:25.456 --> 06:27.490
Juste have this
big event tomorrow.

06:27.491 --> 06:28.624
- Mm, I saw.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.360
Every piece of stemware
in the hamptons

06:30.361 --> 06:32.262
Was in your driveway.

06:32.263 --> 06:34.664
- As the prep gets more intense,
so do the headaches.

06:34.665 --> 06:36.766
They put me in such a daze.

06:36.767 --> 06:39.970
- That sounds like
a vasospastic headache.

06:39.971 --> 06:41.738
You should really
see a doctor.

06:41.739 --> 06:43.207
- Ah, it's just stress.

06:43.208 --> 06:45.309
Comes with the territory
of being a winemaker.

06:45.310 --> 06:46.609
- But just in case,

06:46.610 --> 06:49.012
You should make an appointment
with the doctor.

06:49.013 --> 06:51.814
With us.
If you want.

06:51.815 --> 06:53.082
- Thanks.

06:57.653 --> 07:00.088
<i>- My toe is killing m</i>

07:00.089 --> 07:02.957
- Yeah. No hematomas
to the scalp.

07:02.958 --> 07:04.992
No vertebral tenderness.

07:04.993 --> 07:07.629
- Okay. Lung sounds
are equal bilaterally.

07:07.630 --> 07:10.698
- Y-you realize
you're north of my toe?

07:10.699 --> 07:12.466
- You are lucky
that a subungal hematoma

07:12.467 --> 07:14.099
Is your only real problem.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.000
- Actually,
I-I have another problem.

07:16.001 --> 07:18.836
I have no idea
what you just said.

07:18.837 --> 07:21.337
- You have blood
under your toenail.

07:21.338 --> 07:23.239
- Hmm. Not as cool
when you say it.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.941
Must be her accent.
- Right.

07:24.942 --> 07:27.109
I think I saw a blowtorch
back there--can you grab it?

07:27.110 --> 07:28.443
- Mm.

07:28.444 --> 07:29.978
- What are you,
gonna spot weld me to something?

07:29.979 --> 07:31.446
I will if you get fresh.

07:31.447 --> 07:33.016
No, I'm just heating
the needle.

07:33.017 --> 07:34.818
So how did this happen,
guys?

07:34.819 --> 07:37.055
- We were kind of racing
the rklift and the ferrari.

07:37.056 --> 07:38.290
- , of course you were.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.891
I mean, it was a stupid
question, really.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.192
- Actually, it was my fault.

07:41.193 --> 07:43.227
Tucker and I have been friends
since we were kids.

07:43.228 --> 07:45.129
- My dad was very good
customer here.

07:45.130 --> 07:46.630
I'm sure you could imagine.

07:46.631 --> 07:48.431
- Would you lie down?

07:48.432 --> 07:50.266
How doeshat lead
to racing a sports car?

07:50.267 --> 07:52.668
- That's--that's simple,
actually.

07:52.669 --> 07:55.037
Oliver here is a, um...
What's the word?

07:55.038 --> 07:56.671
Sociopath.

07:56.672 --> 07:58.906
- Tucker...
Is a boy scout.

07:58.907 --> 08:00.474
He completes me.

08:00.475 --> 08:02.276
- You know, every time
you step into a ferrari,

08:02.277 --> 08:04.678
Something fairly bad happens--
just an observation.

08:04.679 --> 08:06.280
- Maybe I should buy a saab.

08:06.281 --> 08:08.516
Give the forklift
a fighting chance.

08:08.517 --> 08:11.352
- Just relax.

08:13.554 --> 08:15.889
Okay, pressure's released.
You should feel better now.

08:15.890 --> 08:18.425
- Yeah. He seems quite content.

08:18.426 --> 08:22.028
- So...I'm guessing his toe
isn't his biggest problem.

09:01.983 --> 09:04.017
- So how long have you
been fatigued?

09:04.018 --> 09:06.685
- Ever since I got back
for the re-launch.

09:06.686 --> 09:09.188
We switched over to biodynamic
a couple of years ago,

09:09.189 --> 09:11.423
And we're debuting
the new vintages tomorrow.

09:11.424 --> 09:13.224
- I've heard about that.
It's organic.

09:13.225 --> 09:14.525
Environmentally friendly.

09:14.526 --> 09:16.127
- Yeah. It was actually
oliver's idea.

09:16.128 --> 09:17.595
It's the first in the region.

09:17.596 --> 09:19.430
He's giving a speech
about it tomorrow at the party

09:19.431 --> 09:20.998
- You guys should come
check it out.

09:20.999 --> 09:22.298
Bring your friends.

09:22.299 --> 09:24.700
We want the place to be
packed for the press photos.

09:24.701 --> 09:26.735
- Sounds like a great cause.
- Yep.

09:26.736 --> 09:29.371
But before you came back
for the re-launch,

09:29.372 --> 09:31.239
We talked and you said
you were sleeping in

09:31.240 --> 09:33.041
And missing classes.

09:33.042 --> 09:34.976
- Freedom. Parties.

09:34.977 --> 09:36.577
Ladies.

09:36.578 --> 09:38.646
- Yeah. Except that uc davis

09:38.647 --> 09:40.481
Is the top wine-making
program in the country,

09:40.482 --> 09:42.282
And you worked your ass off
to get in.

09:42.283 --> 09:44.050
- Yeah. And I will
bounce back next semester.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.785
You're freaking out
over nhing.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.020
- You fell asleep driving
a forklift

09:48.021 --> 09:50.088
In a race with a hemophiliac.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.857
- I was just trying to take
tucker's mind off

09:51.858 --> 09:54.425
The whole
disinheritance thing.

09:54.426 --> 09:57.261
- What...

09:57.262 --> 09:59.462
- We'll talk about it later.

09:59.463 --> 10:03.132
Or maybe ollie will just
blog about iand save me time.

10:03.133 --> 10:04.533
- Oh! I'm sorry.

10:04.534 --> 10:07.468
I didn't realize
it was covert ops.

10:07.469 --> 10:09.270
- We should take some blood.

10:09.271 --> 10:12.039
Uh...It could be mono.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.440
- The kissing disease?

10:13.441 --> 10:15.275
Yeah, that actually
totally lines up.

10:15.276 --> 10:16.810
- Definitely a possibility.

10:16.811 --> 10:19.046
- And a tox screen
is standard.

10:19.047 --> 10:20.614
- A...Tox screen?

10:20.615 --> 10:22.449
Now you sound like my dad.

10:22.450 --> 10:24.685
- Yeah. Hank, don't--
don't worry about it.

10:24.686 --> 10:28.254
Oliver was around for a lot
of the times that my dad was...

10:28.255 --> 10:31.758
- Tucker and I made a pact
to stay away from that crap.

10:39.432 --> 10:40.498
- Divya.
- Hey.

10:40.499 --> 10:42.800
- What are you
doing here?

10:42.801 --> 10:44.235
- Blood samples.

10:44.236 --> 10:45.903
From the ambrose
fountain winery.

10:45.904 --> 10:47.904
Hey, you want a drink
for free tomorrow?

10:47.905 --> 10:49.405
- At the winery?
I'm already going.

10:49.406 --> 10:51.941
I think everyone in town
is going.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.609
- Breakfast at noon?

10:53.610 --> 10:55.278
- Uh...Ha.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.680
I was too nauseated
to eat at breakfast.

10:57.681 --> 10:59.415
it's the hospital board.

10:59.416 --> 11:01.183
Bunch of greedy bastards.

11:01.184 --> 11:02.918
- They bought you
cheap breakfast food?

11:02.919 --> 11:04.819
- No. It's their clinic
proposal.

11:04.820 --> 11:07.488
It doesn't treat a patient
for three years.

11:07.489 --> 11:09.023
- Why?

11:09.024 --> 11:11.093
- They want to use the cash
for more pressing needs.

11:11.094 --> 11:12.495
- Greedy bastards, indeed.

11:12.496 --> 11:14.497
- Now I'm starving.

11:14.498 --> 11:16.332
Hey, um, do you wanna
grab lunch?

11:16.333 --> 11:17.700
I don't know why,

11:17.701 --> 11:19.535
But I have this deep,
uncontrollable craving

11:19.536 --> 11:21.370
For p, b and j.

11:21.371 --> 11:24.372
- Nausea and strange
cravings, huh?

11:26.507 --> 11:27.841
Hey, uh...

11:27.842 --> 11:30.375
How long has it been
since you and hank...

11:30.376 --> 11:32.677
Broke up?

11:36.882 --> 11:39.690
- No way.

11:39.691 --> 11:42.860
Oh, god!

11:59.044 --> 12:00.978
- Hey, thanks for buying this.

12:00.979 --> 12:02.580
I can't buy a latte
in this town

12:02.581 --> 12:04.382
Without people asking me
about it.

12:04.383 --> 12:07.686
If I got one at the hospital...
Whoo-hoo!

12:07.687 --> 12:10.087
- What does whoo-hoo mean?

12:10.088 --> 12:12.757
- Minus equals not pregnant.

12:12.758 --> 12:15.025
God, I love a minus.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.429
I'm going to get a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

12:30.843 --> 12:33.878
- Hank?
I got some big news.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.147
- Whoever makes your shirts
discovered a brand-new pastel?

12:36.148 --> 12:37.582
- I'll have you know

12:37.583 --> 12:39.783
This is actually all
woody harrelson-approved hemp.

12:39.784 --> 12:42.085
This is my shout-out
to the environment.

12:42.086 --> 12:43.787
- Well, that is big news.

12:43.788 --> 12:47.524
- Well, it's not as big
as divya gettin' knocked up.

12:47.525 --> 12:48.926
- What?

12:48.927 --> 12:50.629
- I saw her at the store
yesterday.

12:50.630 --> 12:52.063
She was buying
a pregnancy test.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.598
- Okay.

12:53.599 --> 12:55.433
- I guess I always thought
she would change her mind

12:55.434 --> 12:57.769
About marrying raj
and moving to london.

12:57.770 --> 12:59.304
- Okay, I know what you mean,

12:59.305 --> 13:00.906
But there are two ways
those tests can go.

13:00.907 --> 13:02.574
- Right.
That's a good point.

13:02.575 --> 13:04.209
I didn't even think of that.
Okay. Good.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.577
I'll investigate
at the winery.

13:05.578 --> 13:08.146
- Great.
- Speaking of which, uh...

13:08.147 --> 13:09.781
I invited dad.
- Why--

13:09.782 --> 13:11.316
- Because
it's right up his alley.

13:11.317 --> 13:13.385
It's all about biodynamics
and green tech.

13:13.386 --> 13:14.819
I told you about
his bluesky company, right?

13:14.820 --> 13:16.821
- You did. Right after I told
you not to tell me about it.

13:16.822 --> 13:18.056
- Oh, my god, suck it up.

13:18.057 --> 13:19.457
Henry, you are seeing
your father today,

13:19.458 --> 13:21.092
Whether you like it or not.
- Rich people

13:21.093 --> 13:22.894
Too drunk
to protect their wallets--

13:22.895 --> 13:24.462
I'm sure he jumped
at the invite.

13:24.463 --> 13:26.264
- Actually, he really cares
about this stuff.

13:26.265 --> 13:27.832
- Yeah.
- Plus, he gets to hang

13:27.833 --> 13:30.268
With his two sons...

13:30.269 --> 13:32.670
Just like the old days.

13:36.341 --> 13:38.242
You always did love costumes.

13:39.844 --> 13:43.514
- We were on a treasure hunt,
remember?

13:48.921 --> 13:52.290
Yay!

13:52.291 --> 13:55.693
- I don't remember it
that way.

14:05.706 --> 14:07.540
- I'll see you guys
at the table.

14:07.541 --> 14:10.109
- Okay.

14:12.212 --> 14:14.646
- Hey. I was just leaving.

14:14.647 --> 14:17.145
- Was it something I said,
or something I was going to say?

14:17.146 --> 14:18.613
- No, I got called back
to the hospital.

14:18.614 --> 14:21.115
God forbid I have
an actual day off.

14:21.116 --> 14:23.150
- Well, maybe I'll catch you
at the next biodynamic

14:23.151 --> 14:25.152
Wine-making re-launch party.

14:25.153 --> 14:26.453
- I hope I see you
sooner than that.

14:27.988 --> 14:29.121
- Oh.
- Oh. Uh...

14:29.122 --> 14:30.489
- Sorry.
- Okay, well...

14:30.490 --> 14:32.291
We should definitely
do that again soon.

14:32.292 --> 14:34.893
- Yeah.
We'll nail it next time.

14:34.894 --> 14:36.361
Hey, guys.

14:36.362 --> 14:38.296
I've, uh, I've got
some test results.

14:38.297 --> 14:39.463
Do you wanna speak privately?

14:39.464 --> 14:42.199
- Tucker's like
my little brother.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.567
- Well, it's definitely
not mono.

14:43.568 --> 14:46.135
We're still waiting
on the cbc and chem panel.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.137
- Now, would that show
if he had narcolepsy?

14:48.138 --> 14:50.138
- The symptoms
don't add up for that.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.540
My next step is an mri,

14:51.541 --> 14:53.541
Which I think we should
schedule for tomorrow.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.743
you guys are insane.

14:55.744 --> 14:56.944
I feel fine.

14:56.945 --> 14:58.512
If I fall asleep
on any more forklifts,

14:58.513 --> 15:00.180
I'll call you.

15:10.590 --> 15:13.524
- How many have you taken
today?

15:15.893 --> 15:17.660
- See what I meant
about the stress?

15:17.661 --> 15:19.329
- Did you call your doctor?

15:19.330 --> 15:20.730
- Look, the truth is,

15:20.731 --> 15:22.765
I've only been at this job
for a couple of weeks,

15:22.766 --> 15:25.000
And my insurance
hasn't kicked in yet.

15:31.173 --> 15:33.574
- Evan?

15:33.575 --> 15:34.775
- Hey!

15:34.776 --> 15:36.577
There you are.

15:36.578 --> 15:38.045
That's weird.

15:38.046 --> 15:41.381
Oh, I see you have
an alcoholic beverage there.

15:41.382 --> 15:43.182
- Are you...

15:43.183 --> 15:44.884
Are you spying on me?

15:44.885 --> 15:47.686
- No. I was lookin' for you.
I was--I wanted to say hi.

15:47.687 --> 15:48.720
Hi.

15:48.721 --> 15:51.589
Are you gonna drink that?

15:51.590 --> 15:53.691
- I don't feel like it today.

15:53.692 --> 15:56.460
- Oh. All right.

15:56.461 --> 15:58.261
You know what,
why don't you take a load off?

15:58.262 --> 15:59.796
It's just 'cause of the heat,
you know?

15:59.797 --> 16:01.297
Sit down for five minutes
and rest up.

16:01.298 --> 16:04.033
- Listen, our practice
does pro bono work.

16:04.034 --> 16:05.802
I'm happy to help you.

16:05.803 --> 16:07.870
- I can't talk about it here.

16:11.141 --> 16:12.675
You drink just like my dad.

16:12.676 --> 16:14.010
Though he prefers his wine
in a box.

16:14.011 --> 16:15.511
- Oh, I love those.

16:15.512 --> 16:17.613
Those are really good
for organizing your fridge.

16:17.614 --> 16:20.416
Oh, no, no, no, she's--
I-I'm still thirsty.

16:20.417 --> 16:22.218
- My parents
never really understood

16:22.219 --> 16:23.619
This whole wine-making gig.

16:23.620 --> 16:26.222
They wanted me to have an office
and a 401k.

16:26.223 --> 16:28.324
- Parents seem to think
they know best.

16:28.325 --> 16:31.228
- So what are you picking up?

16:31.229 --> 16:33.230
- From the wine?
- Yeah.

16:33.231 --> 16:34.664
- Kinda lemony, I guess.

16:34.665 --> 16:35.765
It's weird.

16:35.766 --> 16:37.233
I also taste
kind of a shortbread.

16:37.234 --> 16:39.269
- He tends to make things up
as he goes along.

16:39.270 --> 16:40.670
- Uh, that's impressive.

16:40.671 --> 16:42.405
No one ever gets
the shortbread.

16:42.406 --> 16:45.241
- You're saying there actually
is shortbread in it?

16:45.242 --> 16:46.809
- Here.

16:46.810 --> 16:48.844
Try this.

16:49.913 --> 16:51.847
- God, so much wine.

16:54.851 --> 16:56.418
Eech.

16:56.419 --> 16:59.521
It's like burnt toast.
- See? He's an idiot.

16:59.522 --> 17:01.690
- Or he's a super-taster.

17:01.691 --> 17:04.159
- There is no way
that he is a super anything.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.762
- Sorry. L-let the lady talk.
What's a super-taster?

17:06.762 --> 17:08.396
- Well, they have
more taste buds,

17:08.397 --> 17:10.531
So they have a keener sense
of taste than most people.

17:10.532 --> 17:13.268
- So...It's kinda like
a superpower.

17:13.269 --> 17:15.670
You're saying
that I have a superpower.

17:15.671 --> 17:18.839
I found my radioactive spider,
it looks like--holy gosh!

17:18.840 --> 17:20.709
- How 'bout doing me
a little favor?

17:20.710 --> 17:22.877
- Would you like me to go
faster than a speeding bullet?

17:22.878 --> 17:24.445
Would you like me to leap a tall
building in a single bound?

17:24.446 --> 17:26.681
- How 'bout you leap
off a tall building?

17:26.682 --> 17:28.215
- I have some wines
in the barrel room

17:28.217 --> 17:30.451
I'd love your thoughts on.

17:30.452 --> 17:31.719
Care for a private tasting?

17:31.720 --> 17:33.387
- Isn't that your job?

17:33.388 --> 17:36.991
- Well, doctors get second
opinions sometimes, don't they?

17:44.800 --> 17:48.168
hey, check it out.

17:48.169 --> 17:49.903
- What are you doing, man?

17:49.904 --> 17:51.705
- Just a trick
I picked up at school.

17:51.706 --> 17:54.474
No more sneaking corkscrews
out of the tasting room.

17:54.475 --> 17:57.042
Here. Give it a shot.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.977
- Isn't your speech
really soon?

17:58.978 --> 18:02.313
- I'm good to go.
I'm on top of my game.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.681
- Double-fisting wine bottles.

18:04.682 --> 18:06.483
- Relax.

18:08.086 --> 18:10.754
- You know,
you should listen to hank.

18:10.755 --> 18:12.723
First time I met hank,
he saved my life.

18:12.724 --> 18:16.028
Last time I saw him,
he saved my dad's life.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.499
He--he's generally
a good guy to listen to.

18:18.500 --> 18:22.336
- Yeah? Well, I'm not
a hemophiliac or an addict.

18:22.337 --> 18:25.272
You are seriously
killing my buzz right now.

18:25.273 --> 18:28.542
- What's going on?
Just get the mri, oliver.

18:28.543 --> 18:30.778
Please?

18:30.779 --> 18:33.347
to scan for what?

18:33.348 --> 18:36.750
Signs of
"making tucker cry" syndrome?

18:36.751 --> 18:38.885
- Who are you, dude?

18:38.886 --> 18:41.120
You're insulting me, man.

18:41.121 --> 18:43.590
And you're insulting my dad.

18:43.591 --> 18:45.191
You're hammered.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.960
And you're about to make
an important speech

18:46.961 --> 18:48.795
About what you're doing
with your life!

18:48.796 --> 18:51.765
- A-are you really,
really gonna tell me...

18:51.766 --> 18:54.401
That nothing's wrong
right now?

18:54.402 --> 18:56.269
- Spoken like a boy scout.

19:00.574 --> 19:04.978
Well, there goes the whole
little brother feeling, man.

19:10.251 --> 19:12.720
You know,
you're just like family.

19:12.721 --> 19:14.888
<i>You're just like my family.
- You gonna open this or...</i>

19:14.889 --> 19:16.924
Are you gonna keep talking?

19:16.925 --> 19:19.159
Come on.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.162
Stop being such a bitch.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.392
- Thanks for coming so fast.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.360
Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

19:48.361 --> 19:51.062
- I, uh--I got
that factor viii from the car--

19:51.063 --> 19:52.964
- He said I'm fine.

19:52.965 --> 19:54.566
- Thank you.

19:54.567 --> 19:56.634
- Just get the hell
away from me, ollie.

19:56.635 --> 19:58.436
- Dude...

19:58.437 --> 20:00.271
- Maybe...

20:05.210 --> 20:06.810
Look, I know you're angry,

20:06.811 --> 20:09.413
But taking it out on a bottle
only makes things worse.

20:09.414 --> 20:11.115
- He saw everything--

20:11.116 --> 20:13.750
Everything
I went through with my dad.

20:13.751 --> 20:16.653
I just don't understand
how he can do that stuff,

20:16.654 --> 20:18.221
And around me.

20:18.222 --> 20:19.855
- Okay. He's your friend.

20:19.856 --> 20:21.757
Maybe you should give him
the benefit of the doubt.

20:21.758 --> 20:23.426
- You knew from the very
beginning, you know.

20:23.427 --> 20:25.828
The first thing you asked for
was a drug test.

20:25.829 --> 20:27.629
- Well, I ask for
a standard work-up.

20:27.630 --> 20:29.431
Could you put some
pressure on that?

20:29.432 --> 20:31.435
- That's why he wasn't himself,
you know?

20:31.436 --> 20:33.637
That's why
he's been exhausted,

20:33.638 --> 20:37.174
Licking the life out of
potato chip bags.

20:37.175 --> 20:38.508
- Try talking to him

20:38.509 --> 20:39.976
After he's had some time
to cool off.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.978
- You mean sober up?

20:43.647 --> 20:44.814
- Leather?

20:44.815 --> 20:47.850
Um...Kind of a soulful,
pithy...

20:47.851 --> 20:49.785
- Evan.

20:49.786 --> 20:51.086
- Cherry?

20:51.087 --> 20:52.955
Cherry's right?

20:52.956 --> 20:56.358
- This is awesome!
- Why evan, out of all people?

20:56.359 --> 20:57.826
- Whoa!

20:57.827 --> 20:59.861
- Shouldn't you be noting
your own tastes?

20:59.862 --> 21:02.997
- I wish I could,
but I can't taste them at all.

21:02.998 --> 21:04.932
I think it might be an avm.

21:04.933 --> 21:06.867
- Like a dune buggy?
- Or...

21:06.868 --> 21:09.135
An arteriovenous
malformation.

21:09.136 --> 21:10.871
It's an abnormal connection

21:10.872 --> 21:12.572
Between the artery
and the vein.

21:12.573 --> 21:13.840
- Oh.

21:13.841 --> 21:15.276
- But kim,
why would you think that?

21:15.277 --> 21:17.011
- I know what it feels like.

21:17.012 --> 21:18.645
I've...Had one before.

21:18.646 --> 21:20.514
- You have? When?

21:20.515 --> 21:22.851
- Five years ago.
Started with headaches.

21:22.852 --> 21:25.454
Doctor called it
vasospastic then too.

21:25.455 --> 21:28.189
- Did you have a coil placed
in your avm to embolize it?

21:28.190 --> 21:30.559
- I made it through fine.

21:30.560 --> 21:33.461
And when I woke up,
I had this...

21:33.462 --> 21:35.330
Amazing palate.

21:35.331 --> 21:37.965
- Heightened taste.
- I know it sounds crazy,

21:37.966 --> 21:40.835
But I just...I knew I had
to take advantage of it,

21:40.836 --> 21:43.003
Like it was--
like it was meant to happen.

21:43.004 --> 21:47.208
So I quit my desk job,
and I found wine-making.

21:47.209 --> 21:49.010
Then about two days ago,

21:49.011 --> 21:51.112
All the wine started
tasting the same.

21:51.113 --> 21:53.014
And the headaches.

21:53.015 --> 21:54.382
It's happening again.

21:54.383 --> 21:56.583
- Okay, you need a ct scan
right away.

21:56.584 --> 21:59.920
You could have another
symptomatic avm.

21:59.921 --> 22:02.390
- Right away, meaning before
my insurance takes effect?

22:02.391 --> 22:03.658
- Yes.

22:03.659 --> 22:05.493
And don't worry about
your insurance.

22:05.494 --> 22:08.329
You can afford us.
But you cannot afford to wait.

22:11.901 --> 22:14.102
- My new company.
There ya go.

22:14.103 --> 22:16.704
Oh! Dr. Lawson.

22:16.705 --> 22:18.272
- Oh, please...
Call me hank.

22:18.273 --> 22:20.341
- You know, your brother
put me at your table

22:20.342 --> 22:22.042
So I can sit between my sons.

22:22.043 --> 22:24.110
- Oh. Isn't that nice?
- Yeah.

22:24.111 --> 22:25.545
- "got wind"?

22:25.546 --> 22:27.513
- Oh, this is my new energy
company I invested in.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.015
Evan didn't tell you about it?

22:29.016 --> 22:30.951
- Just try and stop him.

22:30.952 --> 22:32.519
- You haven't seen him
anywhere, have you?

22:32.520 --> 22:33.954
- He's...Here somewhere.

22:33.955 --> 22:36.223
- Hey, uh, hank?

22:36.224 --> 22:38.558
Did he by any chance show you
the picture I gave him?

22:38.559 --> 22:42.362
- Oh, yeah...Such a special
memory, the repo lot incident.

22:42.363 --> 22:44.164
- That caddy wasn't repoed.
It was impounded.

22:44.165 --> 22:46.733
And falsely impounded,
as a matter of fact.

22:46.734 --> 22:48.568
We were fighting the system.

22:48.569 --> 22:49.970
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah.

22:49.971 --> 22:51.271
- That's not what I remember.

22:51.272 --> 22:53.140
- Use your foot and push.

22:53.141 --> 22:56.243
Yeah.

23:08.389 --> 23:09.889
- You okay, henry?

23:09.890 --> 23:11.658
- Yeah, but I can't reach
the keys.

23:11.659 --> 23:13.493
- Look around.
See what you could use.

23:18.299 --> 23:19.632
I remember
that that was the day

23:19.633 --> 23:21.768
I realized
you could do anything.

23:21.769 --> 23:25.105
<i>- That was the day I realized
you would do anything.</i>

23:25.106 --> 23:27.608
- Hank.
- Oh, divya, this is eddie...

23:27.609 --> 23:29.009
Lawson.

23:29.010 --> 23:31.443
- I am so happy to see you.

23:31.444 --> 23:33.345
I've heard a lot about you.

23:33.346 --> 23:36.381
I hear you're an invaluable
member of the hankmed team.

23:36.382 --> 23:37.815
Whip smart.

23:37.816 --> 23:39.617
- Well, I've heard
so much about you too.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.952
- Which son
talked about me?

23:41.953 --> 23:43.988
- Okay, could you
excuse us for a second?

23:43.989 --> 23:45.322
- Sure.
- Thanks.

23:45.323 --> 23:48.092
- Let me just say
you sizzle in red.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.494
- All right, easy, killer.

23:49.495 --> 23:52.263
- Thank you.
- Okay.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.831
- Kim. The winemaker.
- Uh-huh.

23:53.832 --> 23:57.101
- Had an avm five years ago
and is having headaches again.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.636
- So she needs a ct.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.204
- I'm taking her
to hamptons heritage now.

24:00.205 --> 24:02.840
- Do you want me to drive you?
- Evan offered as well.

24:02.841 --> 24:06.477
You do remember
that I drove us here, right?

24:06.478 --> 24:08.645
- Yeah, no, no, no.
We just wanna help, you know,

24:08.646 --> 24:11.348
In any way we can with...
Anything...

24:11.349 --> 24:13.851
- When this is over,
I want to know

24:13.852 --> 24:15.819
What is wrong with you two.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.225
- Hey.

24:22.226 --> 24:24.861
Have you talked to him yet?
- No. I haven't seen him.

24:24.862 --> 24:26.663
But his speech
is starting soon.

24:26.664 --> 24:28.698
- All right, well, we'll talk
to himhen he finishes.

24:28.699 --> 24:30.066
- Intervention at a winery.

24:30.067 --> 24:32.302
I justove irony.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.105
So while we have a second,

24:35.106 --> 24:37.574
I know your family finances
are none of my business,

24:37.575 --> 24:39.075
So if you don't wanna
talk about it,

24:39.076 --> 24:40.844
That's totally cool.

24:40.845 --> 24:44.080
Well, when I was a kid,
we had a comfortable life.

24:44.081 --> 24:46.249
I mean, it was no
bryant blender fortune,

24:46.250 --> 24:48.551
But we didn't worry
about money.

24:48.552 --> 24:51.421
Then one day, my father,
uh...

24:51.422 --> 24:52.855
Th's him right over there.

24:52.856 --> 24:55.391
- Wait. I-I thought
your old man was m.I.A.

24:55.392 --> 24:56.726
- He was.

24:56.727 --> 24:58.695
Anyway, he blew it all.

24:58.696 --> 25:02.899
So...I know what it's like
to suddenly be without.

25:02.900 --> 25:05.334
But you have so many things
going for you besides money...

25:05.335 --> 25:07.503
- Well, I appreciate that,
hank, but actually--

25:07.504 --> 25:10.106
- hello, everybody.

25:10.107 --> 25:11.774
Thanks for coming.

25:11.775 --> 25:13.275
We're so very proud of him...

25:13.276 --> 25:14.944
- It's showtime.
- Yeah.

25:14.945 --> 25:16.879
- So without further ado,

25:16.880 --> 25:18.948
Our son oliver.

25:20.116 --> 25:22.251
- A-are those oliver's
parents?

25:22.252 --> 25:26.188
- Yeah. Ye, bob and laura.
Why?

25:26.189 --> 25:27.923
- Is he adopted?

25:27.924 --> 25:29.558
- N-no. Why?

25:29.559 --> 25:31.293
Well, they're so fair-skinned
compared to him.

25:31.294 --> 25:33.428
- Well, he's not usually
that tan.

25:33.429 --> 25:35.564
He just came back
from california that way.

25:35.565 --> 25:38.233
- And you said
he was acting strangely.

25:38.234 --> 25:40.069
I think I know
what's wrong with oliver,

25:40.070 --> 25:43.205
And it's not drugs.

25:43.206 --> 25:44.740
Yeah, uh, this is dr. Lawson.

25:44.741 --> 25:46.642
I have to check
the blood work on a patient.

25:52.146 --> 25:54.147
- Before he makes it up here,

25:54.148 --> 25:55.882
We have to thank
marchant organic farms

25:55.883 --> 25:57.884
For the compost materials.

26:00.621 --> 26:01.821
Oh, yes.
Ha ha.

26:01.822 --> 26:03.823
Just today,
we met a new partner

26:03.824 --> 26:05.491
In bluesky, incorporated.

26:05.492 --> 26:07.393
Eddie lawson, everybody.

26:07.394 --> 26:09.961
- Okay. He has low sodium
and high potassium.

26:09.962 --> 26:12.129
Wh-what does that mean?

26:12.130 --> 26:13.831
- I was right about
the skin discoloration.

26:13.832 --> 26:16.300
It's addison's disease.
- What's that?

26:16.301 --> 26:18.135
- It's a problem
in the adrenal glands.

26:18.136 --> 26:22.706
Also explains his fatigue
and erratic behavior.

26:22.707 --> 26:25.240
- I didn't believe him.

26:25.241 --> 26:27.175
I-is it--is it bad?

26:27.176 --> 26:28.610
- It's treatable,

26:28.611 --> 26:30.245
But it can escalate
if his glands shut down.

26:30.246 --> 26:32.747
We need to find him--now.

26:46.824 --> 26:49.927
Speech.

27:01.538 --> 27:02.938
- The I.V. Is a dye,

27:02.939 --> 27:04.706
So the contrast
will show up on mera.

27:04.707 --> 27:07.408
- Right. I've been
in one of these before.

27:07.409 --> 27:09.343
- Divya, why don't you
join us in the booth?

27:09.344 --> 27:11.545
Just away from the radiation.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.580
- Uh, it is a small amount
of radiation.

27:16.049 --> 27:18.017
- Lucky we had
a light schedule today.

27:18.018 --> 27:19.752
Is there anything more
I can do?

27:19.753 --> 27:21.387
- You know, have you
ever had any problems

27:21.388 --> 27:23.122
With radiation leakage
in here?

27:23.123 --> 27:25.356
Why don't you just wait
in the hall, or go outside?

27:25.357 --> 27:28.626
See...I don't trust this gl--
it's just glass.

27:28.627 --> 27:30.560
- Enough.

27:32.564 --> 27:35.332
You have been fussing over me
all day.

27:35.333 --> 27:36.934
Why?

27:36.935 --> 27:38.468
- Well, excuse me

27:38.469 --> 27:40.904
For trying to protect the baby
from the death rays.

27:40.905 --> 27:42.872
- Whose baby?
- Nice try.

27:42.873 --> 27:44.773
I know.
- Know what?

27:44.774 --> 27:47.776
- I saw you buy
the pregnancy test.

27:47.777 --> 27:50.212
- Not for myself.

27:50.213 --> 27:52.247
- You didn't buy it
for yours...

27:54.216 --> 27:56.183
Oh, my god.

27:56.184 --> 27:57.484
Jill...

27:57.485 --> 27:59.118
Am I gonna be an uncle?
- Shut up!

27:59.119 --> 28:01.554
- Jill is not pregnant.
I am not pregnant.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.388
No one--

28:05.925 --> 28:07.893
Stop!

28:09.596 --> 28:12.631
I think someone is pregnant.

28:12.632 --> 28:13.732
- After what I said to him,

28:13.733 --> 28:15.567
He probably just wanted
to disappear.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.569
- Look, it's not your fault.
Let's just find him.

28:17.570 --> 28:19.271
- Well, he'd be in here.
- Oliver!

28:19.272 --> 28:20.805
- Oliver!

28:20.806 --> 28:22.140
Ollie!

28:22.141 --> 28:23.908
- Are you sure he wouldn't
be somewhere else?

28:23.909 --> 28:25.576
His room, maybe.
- No, no.

28:25.577 --> 28:26.811
We just must have missed him.

28:28.647 --> 28:30.747
Hank. He wouldn't go in there.
He knows better.

28:30.748 --> 28:33.284
- We should make sure, okay?
- Okay.

28:33.285 --> 28:34.652
- Oliver!

28:34.653 --> 28:37.688
- Ollie!
Well, he's not in this one.

28:37.689 --> 28:39.790
- Oliver!
- Ollie!

28:39.791 --> 28:43.056
- Is there a problem her
it's not with evan, is it?

28:43.216 --> 28:43.944
No, Evan is fine, okay?

28:44.528 --> 28:46.962
Hank, he's in here!
Oliver!

28:46.963 --> 28:49.464
Ollie!
He--he's unconscious.

28:49.465 --> 28:51.361
- Don't go in--the fumes!

28:51.362 --> 28:53.186
- I'll hold my breath.
- No--tucker!

28:53.187 --> 28:54.479
You can't stay in there.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.104
It's toxic
down there, tucker!

28:56.105 --> 28:58.969
- Wow, that smells!

28:58.970 --> 29:00.086
- Tucker!

29:02.547 --> 29:04.129
Tucker! Tucker!
Call 911.

29:04.130 --> 29:07.142
Tell them we got a kid trapped
in a confined space.

29:07.143 --> 29:09.130
- Already done and done.
- We gotta get them oxygen.

29:09.131 --> 29:11.019
How do we ventilate this tank?

29:11.020 --> 29:13.876
- There's a fan.
- Good. Get it. Go.

29:14.877 --> 29:16.731
- How do we get the fan
up there?

29:16.732 --> 29:19.645
- We don't--we have to
circulate air from the bottom.

29:19.646 --> 29:20.718
- What?

29:20.900 --> 29:22.825
- The carbon and sulfur dioxides
from the fermentation process

29:23.400 --> 29:24.408
Settle in the bottom
of the tank

29:24.503 --> 29:25.808
Because they're heavier
than air.

29:28.093 --> 29:30.180
He. You can plug it in.

29:30.181 --> 29:31.675
- Excellent.

29:31.676 --> 29:33.629
- Hey, what if we use
ese, uh,

29:33.630 --> 29:35.551
Welder's o2 canisters
and shove the oxygenown?

29:35.552 --> 29:37.772
- No , too dangerous.
One spark of static electricity

29:37.773 --> 29:39.527
Could send the whole thing
up in flames.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.974
- Well, we gotta get
the kid outta there.

29:43.737 --> 29:44.889
- Pulley!
- Pulley!

29:44.890 --> 29:46.384
Okay, I see rope.
- Good, go.

30:04.937 --> 30:06.131
Tucker.

30:08.354 --> 30:10.635
Tucker!
- What happened?

30:10.636 --> 30:13.090
- All right, stay near
the opening in the side.

30:13.091 --> 30:14.978
Right here,
near that fan.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.100
Breathe.
That's it.

30:19.390 --> 30:21.044
- Do you have
any pain anywhere?

30:21.045 --> 30:22.932
- Um...No.
No. I-I don't think so.

30:22.933 --> 30:26.214
- Are you bleedi?
- No. No, I'm good.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.629
- You're gonna put this harness
around oliver,

30:28.630 --> 30:30.390
Under his arms, all right?

30:30.391 --> 30:32.672
- Yep.

30:32.673 --> 30:34.994
tucker, lay down for a sec.

30:34.995 --> 30:38.604
Okay? Just lay down...
Face that opening and breathe.

30:38.605 --> 30:40.926
That's fresh air.
Good.

30:40.927 --> 30:43.281
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

30:43.282 --> 30:45.860
Here we go.

30:45.861 --> 30:46.920
Good.

30:46.921 --> 30:48.181
Good. That's it.

30:48.182 --> 30:49.734
nice!

30:49.735 --> 30:51.986
Okay, nice job.
Now, just lay back down

30:51.987 --> 30:53.672
And breathe in that fresh air.

30:53.673 --> 30:55.861
All right...Here we go.

30:57.549 --> 30:58.709
- I'll pull, you lock.
- Okay.

30:58.710 --> 31:00.930
- Here we go!

31:00.931 --> 31:04.013
- Okay.
- Come on! Pull!

31:04.014 --> 31:06.461
- One more. Okay.

31:06.462 --> 31:09.977
here we go. One more.

31:09.978 --> 31:12.859
- Ah!
- Okay, come on.

31:26.107 --> 31:27.133
- All right.
- You got him?

31:27.134 --> 31:29.489
- Yeah.
It's coming...

31:30.851 --> 31:32.637
There we go.
- All right.

31:32.638 --> 31:34.425
Lay him down
gently, gently, gently.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.313
- There we go.
I got you.

31:36.314 --> 31:39.362
- All right.

31:39.363 --> 31:41.417
He's breathing,
but it's labored.

31:41.818 --> 31:44.432
Okay, you stay with him,
all right?

31:44.433 --> 31:46.920
Yell if anything changes.
- Okay.

31:46.921 --> 31:49.535
- Here you go.
Now, put the rig on yourself.

31:49.536 --> 31:51.390
- I think I could
just climb up.

31:51.391 --> 31:52.918
- If you fall,
this gets worse, all right?

31:52.919 --> 31:55.006
Just put the harness
under your arms.

31:55.007 --> 31:56.894
That's it.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.294
Dad!

32:07.295 --> 32:09.182
I need you!

32:09.183 --> 32:10.844
Now, hurry!
Come on.

32:10.845 --> 32:13.159
- Yeah. I'm coming.

32:13.160 --> 32:15.087
- I'll pull.
You lock.

32:17.637 --> 32:19.925
- Go! Come on, one more.

32:19.926 --> 32:22.507
Go!

32:22.508 --> 32:25.489
Uhh!
That's it.

32:25.490 --> 32:27.311
That's it!

32:27.312 --> 32:28.572
Lean him up against the vat.

32:28.573 --> 32:30.326
All right,
you keep an eye on oliver.

32:30.327 --> 32:32.880
let's get this rope off you.

32:34.268 --> 32:35.988
- Okay.

32:35.989 --> 32:37.249
No. No swelling.

32:37.250 --> 32:38.577
Do you feel any pain
in your joints

32:38.578 --> 32:40.164
Or a prickly feeling?

32:40.165 --> 32:42.586
- No. No. No, I'm fine.

32:42.587 --> 32:44.073
Oliver!
- You saved him, tucker.

32:44.074 --> 32:45.401
- No, oliv--
- just lie still

32:45.402 --> 32:47.089
Until the paramedics come.

32:47.090 --> 32:48.416
- Hey, hank, get over here.

32:48.417 --> 32:49.905
He doesn't sound right.

32:49.906 --> 32:52.167
It's like wheezing
or something.

32:52.968 --> 32:55.204
- Upper airway obstruction
due to swelling.

32:55.205 --> 32:56.882
He's turning cyanotic.

32:56.883 --> 32:58.358
He's not getting enough oxygen.

32:58.359 --> 33:00.545
- Oliver?

33:03.326 --> 33:04.460
- So what do we do?

33:04.461 --> 33:05.727
- We have to intubate.

33:05.728 --> 33:07.228
My bag's in divya's car.
- I'll get it.

33:07.229 --> 33:08.830
- No, no, no.
She left for the hospital.

33:08.831 --> 33:10.998
- Hank...
- Tuck--tucker, stay put.

33:10.999 --> 33:13.567
Just stay put.
Okay, check the work bench.

33:13.568 --> 33:14.868
- For what?
- Flexible wire.

33:14.869 --> 33:16.603
Something to cut
copper tubing with.

33:16.604 --> 33:19.204
And we can use
that oxygen now.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.540
I need something
to sterilize with.

33:21.541 --> 33:24.276
- Is there enough alcohol
in the wine?

33:24.277 --> 33:26.276
- I-I don't think so,
but what else do we have?

33:26.277 --> 33:28.314
- Hey, you know,
bobby ambrose

33:28.315 --> 33:31.083
Said that they make
the grappa from remnants.

33:32.519 --> 33:35.387
- Thank you, bobby.
Plenty of alcohol here.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.054
I need the clippers.

33:38.856 --> 33:40.523
Perfect.

33:47.897 --> 33:50.999
Piercing crycothyroid
membrane.

33:53.903 --> 33:56.037
- Good. Wire.

33:56.038 --> 33:57.638
- Wire.

33:57.639 --> 33:59.373
- Hank, he's blue.

33:59.374 --> 34:00.541
- Yeah.

34:00.542 --> 34:02.209
We're fixing that.

34:04.545 --> 34:05.545
- Oh, wow.

34:10.449 --> 34:11.750
Oh, wow!

34:11.751 --> 34:14.485
- Advancing endotracheal tube.

34:18.891 --> 34:21.793
<i>- Oh, wow!</i>

34:31.601 --> 34:35.905
Eh, we need something
to seal these tubes together.

34:35.906 --> 34:37.773
- Well, I thought
it would come in handy.

34:37.774 --> 34:38.940
- It will.

34:53.456 --> 34:55.724
It worked.
He's breathing.

34:55.725 --> 34:57.726
- Yeah.

34:57.727 --> 35:00.595
Yeah.

35:00.596 --> 35:01.930
- He's gonna be fine.

35:03.833 --> 35:05.434
Whoo!

35:05.435 --> 35:08.837
- You certainly surpassed
everything I taught you.

35:08.838 --> 35:11.240
- This one was new to me too.

35:11.241 --> 35:13.208
And, uh...

35:13.209 --> 35:15.677
I couldn't have
done it alone.

35:20.184 --> 35:22.518
- It's been a long time
since you called me dad...

35:22.519 --> 35:24.153
Let alone asked for my help.

35:26.623 --> 35:29.125
- Yeah.

35:30.327 --> 35:32.394
Okay.

35:35.665 --> 35:37.333
- It's called dysgeusia.

35:37.334 --> 35:40.736
Some pregnant women
can taste metal, chalk,

35:40.737 --> 35:41.904
Or nothing at all.

35:41.905 --> 35:43.839
- Weird.
It's good news, though.

35:43.840 --> 35:45.574
Mazel tov.
Absolutely.

35:45.575 --> 35:48.377
- And the headaches?
- You're probably dehydrated.

35:48.378 --> 35:51.179
Your bodily fluid volume
decreases with pregnancy.

35:51.180 --> 35:52.714
- Ooh, that is weird.
That's--

35:52.715 --> 35:55.050
The kid's already leaching
on your life force.

35:55.051 --> 35:56.585
In a good way, though.

35:56.586 --> 35:58.754
- Your palate could return
any time during pregnancy,

35:58.755 --> 36:00.489
Certainly by the time
you give birth.

36:00.490 --> 36:03.658
- Thanks for everything.

36:03.659 --> 36:05.360
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

36:05.361 --> 36:06.361
I'm not usually a crier.

36:06.362 --> 36:08.396
- It's probably
the hormones.

36:09.732 --> 36:10.732
- Yeah, weird.
Really weird.

36:10.733 --> 36:12.067
- Can you believe it?

36:15.772 --> 36:17.306
- I can't believe
how nice you were to me

36:17.307 --> 36:18.974
When you thought
I was pregnant.

36:18.975 --> 36:20.875
It was like invasion
of the body snatchers.

36:20.876 --> 36:22.176
- I know,
I was just worried about

36:22.177 --> 36:23.777
Your crazy pregnancy
lady emotions--

36:23.778 --> 36:25.412
What do you want?

36:25.413 --> 36:27.348
That's not a horror film
I'd like to see, by the way.

36:27.349 --> 36:28.651
- Lucky for you,
I'll be long gone

36:28.652 --> 36:30.353
Before there's
any chance of that.

36:30.354 --> 36:33.556
- Yeah.

36:33.557 --> 36:35.625
Do you have to be?

36:38.127 --> 36:41.930
I honestly don't know
if hank and I can do this...

36:41.931 --> 36:44.099
Without you.

36:47.637 --> 36:49.605
- I have to move to london.

36:49.606 --> 36:51.407
- Of course you do.

36:51.408 --> 36:57.213
Well, uh, when we replace you
with another sexy indian p.A.,

36:57.214 --> 37:00.049
Uh...It won't be the same.

37:00.050 --> 37:02.218
Here, let me get that.

37:04.254 --> 37:07.490
- I appreciate that.

37:15.833 --> 37:18.067
- He'll need an acth test,

37:18.068 --> 37:19.569
But it looks like
addison's disease.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.471
He needs hydrocortisone
and saline.

37:21.472 --> 37:24.006
So luckily,
the steroids for addison's

37:24.007 --> 37:25.675
Will reduce the swelling
in his airway.

37:25.676 --> 37:27.344
He'll be breathing on his own
by the end of the day.

37:27.345 --> 37:29.512
- How the hell do you rig
something like this on the fly?

37:29.513 --> 37:31.114
- You look around,
see what you could use.

37:31.115 --> 37:33.750
- That's my line.
- Hank, I'm fine.

37:33.751 --> 37:37.020
- Come on, tucker, you're
going to the hospital too.

37:37.021 --> 37:39.123
- Hey, tell ollie
I'll race him there.

37:40.292 --> 37:42.293
- Hold it.

37:44.030 --> 37:47.265
That's my boy.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.308
- When I got the tweet
tucker was in the hospital,

37:58.309 --> 37:59.576
I came down with

37:59.577 --> 38:02.312
A sudden inflammatory
autoimmune disorder.

38:02.313 --> 38:03.613
- Huh?

38:03.614 --> 38:05.181
- It's an inside joke.

38:05.182 --> 38:07.283
- Oh. Okay.
Very cute.

38:07.284 --> 38:10.687
- So I-is ollie just gonna
go back to normal now?

38:10.688 --> 38:12.155
- His symptoms
will be controlled

38:12.156 --> 38:13.556
By a permanent drug regimen.

38:13.557 --> 38:15.325
- You know what?
Thank him for the wine.

38:15.326 --> 38:17.527
So awesome.
I'm gonna start with this guy.

38:17.528 --> 38:19.029
- Okay. You need
to chill that first.

38:19.030 --> 38:21.365
- Yeah. No, just put
some ice cubes in it.

38:21.366 --> 38:23.367
- Don't you dare!

38:23.368 --> 38:24.668
evan!

38:24.669 --> 38:25.702
- It's under control.

38:25.703 --> 38:28.337
- Good. Good to know.

38:28.338 --> 38:31.639
- So...You and your pop
saving the day together.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.508
You should really
take that act on the road.

38:33.509 --> 38:36.144
- Yeah. That was
a one-night only show.

38:36.145 --> 38:39.546
But a good reminder that...

38:39.547 --> 38:42.215
You never really know
what to expect from family.

38:42.216 --> 38:45.885
- It's like my
disinheritance dilemma.

38:45.886 --> 38:48.020
You had it wrong.

38:48.021 --> 38:50.355
I'm not getting cut off.

38:50.356 --> 38:52.223
My dad is.

38:52.224 --> 38:54.859
- Oh.
- Yeah.

38:54.860 --> 38:57.227
My grandfather's
giving it all to me.

38:57.228 --> 38:59.429
And I'm in charge
of my dad's allowance.

38:59.430 --> 39:02.098
So...I guess just, uh...

39:02.099 --> 39:05.867
Any future health crisis bills
you can send my way.

39:05.868 --> 39:08.136
- That's a lot of
responsibility...

39:08.137 --> 39:09.938
Even for the boy scout.

39:09.939 --> 39:12.106
- Yeah, well, it's just
the latest battle

39:12.107 --> 39:14.641
In a long-running civil war.

39:14.642 --> 39:16.243
That's never been very civil.

39:16.244 --> 39:20.846
- Well, of all
the 17-year-olds I know...

39:20.847 --> 39:23.716
You're the one I'd trust.

39:23.717 --> 39:25.417
- Thanks, hank.

39:39.830 --> 39:41.097
- So as you know,

39:41.098 --> 39:42.632
I've always wanted
my own superpower.

39:42.633 --> 39:45.000
I just want to take this moment
to express

39:45.001 --> 39:48.670
Um...How happy I am
that I get to say

39:48.671 --> 39:51.006
I have a superpower,
basically.

39:51.007 --> 39:53.008
- All right.
Here we go.

39:53.009 --> 39:54.843
Eh, d--hold on.

39:54.844 --> 39:56.444
Okay. There you go.

39:56.445 --> 39:58.780
- Are you ready for real?
- Let's do this.

39:58.781 --> 40:01.015
- Here we go.

40:03.252 --> 40:04.252
Okay.

40:04.253 --> 40:06.154
- Bring it.

40:06.155 --> 40:07.655
- I taste orange, lemon,
a hint of raspberry.

40:07.656 --> 40:08.923
I'm definitely getting

40:08.924 --> 40:10.692
Some partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil.

40:10.693 --> 40:12.861
- Interesting.
- I don't wanna be a snob here,

40:12.862 --> 40:14.295
But...
- Feel free.

40:14.296 --> 40:15.563
- No, I d-I--okay.

40:15.564 --> 40:16.998
The loops are definitely
not true rings.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.966
I feelike they're more
like jagged ovals.

40:18.967 --> 40:21.502
- Mm. Well, super-palate...

40:21.503 --> 40:23.271
What is it?

40:23.272 --> 40:25.873
- Oh, god, it's so hard.
I just--I don't know if I...

40:25.874 --> 40:27.274
Fruity puffs.

40:27.275 --> 40:29.843
- You got it, super-palate!

40:29.844 --> 40:31.278
- I knew it.

40:31.279 --> 40:34.147
- I guess we better order
tights and a cape.

40:34.148 --> 40:36.283
- Which reminds me, um...

40:36.284 --> 40:39.553
There's something
I wanna tell you.

40:41.389 --> 40:43.156
You were right.

40:43.157 --> 40:46.460
Yeah. You were right about
divya not being pregnant.

40:46.461 --> 40:48.895
You were right about the
treasure hunt when we were kids.

40:48.896 --> 40:51.197
And...I don't know.

40:51.198 --> 40:54.133
I guess I have some weird
kryptonian mental block

40:54.134 --> 40:57.637
When it comes to what's real
and...

40:57.638 --> 40:59.039
What I want to be real.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.907
- Actually...

41:00.908 --> 41:03.376
I was gonna say
you were rht.

41:03.377 --> 41:05.578
- You were gonna say what?

41:05.579 --> 41:07.046
I didn't--I-I'm getting
like a weird

41:07.047 --> 41:08.681
Stepford feeling
from you right now

41:08.682 --> 41:10.750
Because you've never said
those words to me

41:10.751 --> 41:12.351
Ever...In our lives.

41:12.352 --> 41:14.287
- I said them.

41:14.288 --> 41:16.155
You were right.

41:16.156 --> 41:19.492
I remember that day.

41:19.493 --> 41:23.129
The treasure hunt.

41:23.130 --> 41:25.564
It really was an adventure.

41:25.565 --> 41:27.199
- You don't even know
how proud I am of you.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.334
