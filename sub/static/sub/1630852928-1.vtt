01:51.361 --> 01:55.615
Good friends,
tonight on Saint Brice's Day,

01:56.199 --> 01:58.868
we say goodbye to my baby brother,

01:59.494 --> 02:03.206
Prince Harald Sigurdsson,
the someday King of Norway.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.500
[all cheering]

02:06.084 --> 02:08.795
He thinks he's graced us with his presence

02:09.462 --> 02:12.757
but we know it's him
who's been made better by his visit.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.509
[all laugh]

02:14.592 --> 02:16.427
-Skol!
-[all] Skol!

02:16.511 --> 02:17.637
[indistinct chatter]

02:17.720 --> 02:20.390
May the Lord guide you
back to Norway, brother.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.142
Stay safe till I see you again.

02:23.476 --> 02:24.602
Where are you going?

02:25.770 --> 02:27.981
-I thought you're seeing me to the boat.
-I know.

02:28.064 --> 02:31.109
But the King has summoned us.
We're off to London.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.909
But I'm sure you'll find
a better send-off than me.

02:39.993 --> 02:40.994
Hmm?

02:42.036 --> 02:43.037
Brother.

02:53.298 --> 02:57.385
So, when are you coming back
to England, Prince Harald?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.555
I don't know.

03:00.638 --> 03:03.308
Perhaps… when I hear a good reason.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.476
[footsteps approaching]

03:06.978 --> 03:10.648
Prince Harald, the boat's waiting.
We must leave.

03:19.782 --> 03:21.367
[woman 1 and man 1] Prince Harald!

03:21.451 --> 03:23.369
-[woman 2] Prince Harald.
-[man 2] Travel well.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.704

03:52.232 --> 03:55.652
Sten. My faithful guards.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.821
Your Highness,
we came as soon as we could.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.198
I know it is Saint Brice's Day

04:00.281 --> 04:03.451
and you have
undoubtedly left feasts with family.

04:03.534 --> 04:04.827
So, please join me.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.795
You said it was urgent, sire.
Is there a threat?

04:14.462 --> 04:15.463
Yes.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.257
[dramatic music playing]

04:18.967 --> 04:20.718
Over a hundred years ago,

04:21.386 --> 04:24.389
in an effort to ensure lasting peace
with your people,

04:25.181 --> 04:27.767
my predecessors established the Danelaw.

04:27.850 --> 04:28.685
[Sten] Yes, sire.

04:28.768 --> 04:32.021
We've been here so long, many of us
no longer remember our own language.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.900
Exactly. They probably feel
they are Saxon.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.402
Yes.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.195
But that's the problem, you see.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.155
They're not.

04:42.198 --> 04:43.783
This is not their home.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.120
When the cockle grows amongst the barley,

04:48.288 --> 04:51.499
there is only one way to purify the field.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.131
Therefore, tonight,

04:59.674 --> 05:04.304
I order that all Vikings
living on this island…

05:06.931 --> 05:08.057
be exterminated.

No.

It is more beautiful than I ever imagined.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.813
[men shouting indistinctly]

10:16.073 --> 10:17.116
And bigger.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.755
[man 1] Here. Bring it across.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.506
-[man 2] The line?
-[man 1] Yeah.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.482
How in Odin's name
did you avoid the storm?

10:49.565 --> 10:52.068
Did any ships from the west
make it in last night?

10:52.777 --> 10:55.488
No, just two ships before the storm.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.158
It's possible.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.333
Toke, Ulf, you stay here
with the boats and resupply.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.252
Freydis, check with
the captains at the harbor.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.421
Rest of you will come with me
to search the town.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.966
-I'm coming too.
-No, you'll get your moment.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.138
-[woman] There are so many.
-[man 1] There's another one.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.474
[man 2 shouts indistinctly]

11:23.557 --> 11:25.393
[Harald] How many have we lost?

11:25.476 --> 11:26.644
[man 3] Hundreds of them.

11:27.895 --> 11:30.898
[man 4] Help me move these.
We need more space here on the right.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.733
[dogs barking]

11:34.985 --> 11:36.570
[man 5] We need more wagons!

11:37.863 --> 11:40.116
[indistinct chatter in foreign language]

12:08.561 --> 12:10.104
[woman in English] Fragrance!

12:11.480 --> 12:12.523
Smell!

12:15.651 --> 12:18.195
Fragrance! Perfume!

12:21.866 --> 12:22.783
Njal…

12:25.494 --> 12:27.705
You, Yrsa and… Liv!

12:32.877 --> 12:34.962
Spread out and search the market.

12:35.045 --> 12:37.339
I'll check the great hall
and see if they paid homage.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.674
I'll meet you back at the boat.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.485
-Where are you from?
-Greenland.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.155
What kind of journey was it?

13:01.238 --> 13:05.409
Long. Five weeks. No stops.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.997
Five weeks across open ocean in this?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.292
I'm impressed.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.171
Then you are easily impressed.

13:18.339 --> 13:21.717
Not true. My standards are quite high.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.511
So are mine.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.641
Are you from Kattegat?

13:29.433 --> 13:32.394
No, from Ringerike.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.313
I'm Harald Sigurdsson.

13:35.397 --> 13:36.357
Who are you?

13:37.775 --> 13:38.859
My name is Freydis.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.447
After a long voyage on such a small boat,

13:44.031 --> 13:47.868
I would think a hot bath would sound good
to someone with high standards.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.037
[both chuckle]

13:51.664 --> 13:55.918
After a long voyage on a small boat,
a lot of things would sound good.

[men shouting indistinctly]

14:01.674 --> 14:04.051

14:25.155 --> 14:28.576
Greetings, brother. Did you just arrive?

14:29.076 --> 14:30.327
[Leif] I did.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.705
Through that storm? Where did you shelter?

14:33.289 --> 14:36.041
We didn't. It caught us at sea.

14:38.961 --> 14:39.962
Join us.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.342
And tell us your name.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.595
Leif. Leif Eriksson.

14:52.391 --> 14:53.309
Ah.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.185
First time in Kattegat?

14:55.269 --> 14:57.146
-First time in Norway.
-From Iceland?

14:58.022 --> 14:59.398
No, Greenland.

14:59.481 --> 15:00.524
To have come that far,

15:00.608 --> 15:03.819
you must have had family killed
in the slaughter like us.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.990
No, I don't know what you mean.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.994
The massacre on Saint Brice's Day.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.163
The murder of our people
by the English king.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.624
That is what this is.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.002
Calling of all Vikings for revenge.

15:21.837 --> 15:24.381
If you're not here
for the gathering, Greenlander,

15:25.174 --> 15:26.967
what has brought you to Kattegat?

15:30.721 --> 15:34.058
I'm looking for a Viking
who wears this cross.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.356
Hey, where did you get this coat?

15:41.190 --> 15:42.274
I want it.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.318
I'll double what it cost you.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.571
This… is what it cost me.

15:48.822 --> 15:51.283
-Double would have killed me.
-[all chuckling]

15:55.454 --> 15:56.497
You know who I am?

15:57.289 --> 15:59.458
I'm Alfrun from Trundelike,

15:59.541 --> 16:01.418
and if I say I want your coat,

16:01.502 --> 16:05.422
your answer is,
"Yes, Alfrun. Right away, Alfrun."

16:07.341 --> 16:08.759
Do you understand?

16:09.885 --> 16:11.512
No… Alfrun.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.764
Go away.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.726
[yells]

16:17.810 --> 16:18.894
[both grunting]

16:23.273 --> 16:24.274
[screaming]

16:24.358 --> 16:25.693
[woman] Stop!

16:27.319 --> 16:30.489
Do you not know where you are?
This is sacred ground.

16:31.865 --> 16:32.741
I'm sorry.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.285
I meant no disrespect.

16:48.674 --> 16:53.012
You fight like that,
but you're not here for the gathering.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.849
What does this man
and his cross mean to you?

16:58.350 --> 16:59.476
It is my business.

17:03.981 --> 17:07.151
It is an English cross, Greenlander.
You can tell by the detail.

17:07.735 --> 17:11.405
Only a Viking who has spent time there
would wear a cross like this.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.825
[horn blowing in distance]

17:17.369 --> 17:20.247
[both panting and moaning]

17:38.682 --> 17:40.684
Are you always like this
when you come off a boat?

17:42.269 --> 17:43.854
Are you complaining?

17:45.272 --> 17:46.231
Not at all.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.610
Just… curious.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.210
-Something wrong?
-[Freydis] No.

18:07.753 --> 18:11.048
Just wondering how it is
you're not from Kattegat but have a tub.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.093
[chuckles softly]

18:16.095 --> 18:19.598
I am the great-grandson
of Harald Finehair.

18:22.684 --> 18:23.977
I don't know who that is.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.355
Is this his tub?

18:28.315 --> 18:29.316
[water splashing]

18:31.235 --> 18:35.239
Why are you in Kattegat,
Freydis from Greenland?

18:42.579 --> 18:43.831
[intense music playing]

18:47.417 --> 18:48.794
I've come to find someone.

18:54.758 --> 18:56.385
Who did that to you?

18:58.846 --> 19:00.472
The person I'm looking for.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.728
What happened?

19:10.607 --> 19:11.817
When I was younger,

19:13.318 --> 19:16.488
a man came to our home
when my father and brothers were away.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.867
He told me he was a Christian Viking.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.453
I had never heard of such a thing before.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.665
When he learned I was alone,

19:27.541 --> 19:29.668
he attacked me and knocked me unconscious.

19:31.211 --> 19:36.383
When I woke, I was naked on my stomach,

19:36.466 --> 19:38.635
tied to a bed and he was on top of me.

19:40.262 --> 19:44.141
He raped me many times and beat me
and called me a Pagan whore.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.811
I didn't even know what a Pagan was.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.482
When he finally finished,

19:53.817 --> 19:55.277
he took out his knife,

19:56.153 --> 19:57.529
carved it on my back,

19:58.947 --> 20:00.657
saying he was converting me.

20:03.744 --> 20:07.664
I've never seen it,
but I know it's a cross.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.095
What is this criminal's name?

20:22.179 --> 20:25.599
-Perhaps I can help you find him.
-[door opens]

20:31.605 --> 20:32.981
There's a ship coming.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.493
[horn blowing]

20:44.576 --> 20:46.662
[dramatic music playing]

20:48.580 --> 20:51.166
[men shouting indistinctly]

20:56.255 --> 20:58.882
[people cheering]

21:14.856 --> 21:15.691
[Harald] Olaf!

21:16.775 --> 21:17.734
Harald.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.405
-[Harald] Olaf.
-It's him.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.784
-[Harald] And Gunnar Magnusson.
-[Olaf grunts]

21:27.202 --> 21:28.036
Brother.

21:29.037 --> 21:29.955
[Harald] Brother.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.416
-Welcome.
-[Leif] Isn't that the man--

21:32.499 --> 21:35.168
Yes. It was.

21:35.252 --> 21:37.170
[Harald] I thought the storm
had claimed you.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.506
Well, we were spared
by the grace of Christ.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.301
We saw the early signs
and waited it out in Riska.

21:43.593 --> 21:44.553
Not now.

21:45.679 --> 21:46.680
[Harald] Come.

21:48.515 --> 21:51.560
Uh, it's not a far journey. Eat something.

21:51.643 --> 21:54.813
-[Olaf] We should go before we lose light.
-Toke, Yrsa.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.732
Go get our things.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.532
[indistinct chatter]

22:09.703 --> 22:11.038
[horse neighs]

22:11.955 --> 22:14.124
[gripping instrumental music playing]

22:37.147 --> 22:39.066
[thrilling instrumental music playing]

23:06.718 --> 23:09.638
By the Gods. It's an army.

23:36.706 --> 23:39.167
Your Highness, may I present,

23:40.210 --> 23:43.130
Olaf Haraldsson and Gunnar Magnusson.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.007
King Canute of Denmark.

23:48.009 --> 23:51.012
Jarl Olaf, I've heard much about you.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.639
Thank you, Your Highness. As have I.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.476
Please, you must be hungry
after your trip.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.147
Harald tells me that you are related.

24:01.022 --> 24:02.732
We share the same mother.

24:02.816 --> 24:05.360
He's my younger, ambitious brother.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.279
We are both ambitious.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.238
[chuckles]

24:08.905 --> 24:11.616
Well, Harald has told me of your plan
to attack England

24:11.700 --> 24:14.119
and avenge King Æthelred's
murder of our people.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.997
How may we be of service?

24:17.080 --> 24:20.375
I understand that you have
knowledge of the English defenses,

24:20.459 --> 24:21.877
especially around London.

24:21.960 --> 24:26.214
Not just knowledge,
we built them for King Æthelred.

24:26.756 --> 24:28.133
Gunnar placed them himself.

24:28.800 --> 24:32.345
Then your skills
are invaluable to our cause.

24:32.429 --> 24:37.267
Our plan is to surprise the English,
send the sea force up the Thames.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.685
That won't work.

24:38.768 --> 24:41.897
The Thames is fortified
from the estuary to the city.

24:41.980 --> 24:44.316
And the English have
a string of lookouts along the coast.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.319
Let us hear your strategy then.

24:47.402 --> 24:48.320
[Olaf] Not yet.

24:50.405 --> 24:53.241
I have a problem
that must be resolved first.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.329
Then, by all means, voice it.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.084
You have gathered
many tribes here, King Canute.

25:03.752 --> 25:07.506
I must admit, I am impressed by
the number of men under your flag.

25:08.715 --> 25:12.427
A great many of those tribes,
however, are Pagans.

25:12.511 --> 25:17.474
Jarl Olaf, this invasion is
to avenge the murder of our people.

25:19.142 --> 25:21.269
All Viking people.

25:22.812 --> 25:26.358
I draw no distinction
between Pagan or Christian.

25:26.441 --> 25:27.776
But I do.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.403
And I refuse to fight with them.

25:31.238 --> 25:34.157
My God and Savior Jesus Christ

25:34.241 --> 25:36.368
would not sanction such a union,

25:36.451 --> 25:40.872
as it would be a sacrilege
and doomed to failure.

25:41.456 --> 25:42.874
And yet here you are.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.379
Therefore, you must have
considered the remedy.

25:47.462 --> 25:48.505
I have.

25:54.636 --> 25:57.305
-A mass conversion.
-[Harald] Are you insane?

25:58.598 --> 26:00.642
[Olaf] What better time than now,

26:00.725 --> 26:04.020
when the leaders of all the Pagan tribes
are gathered together?

26:04.104 --> 26:06.481
What you suggest would start a civil war.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.900
King Æthelred would not have
attacked the Danelaw

26:08.984 --> 26:12.153
if he didn't believe
in the superiority of his defenses.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.780
Defenses we built.

26:15.865 --> 26:19.077
And without that knowledge,
any attack you make is blind.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.873
That is my offer.

26:29.462 --> 26:31.798
Then I am sorry for you, Jarl Olaf.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.051
You have come all this way for nothing.

26:44.269 --> 26:45.895
[Njal] He must be important.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.940
He hasn't come out of the main tent.

26:54.070 --> 26:57.198
-This changes things.
-It changes nothing.

26:58.033 --> 26:58.867
[man] Really?

27:00.285 --> 27:01.453
What is your plan then?

27:03.079 --> 27:05.415
Go down there
and simply take your revenge?

27:10.712 --> 27:12.631
If I have to, yes.

27:18.261 --> 27:19.596
I won't be a part of such a plan.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.307
Then you break your oath to my father, mm?

27:24.142 --> 27:28.229
[sighs] I didn't promise your father
to be a part of foolishness.

27:29.856 --> 27:31.608
What do we know of this place?

27:32.734 --> 27:35.236
Trees, cities, and giant armies?

27:35.904 --> 27:37.322
These Norse are not our people.

27:37.405 --> 27:41.117
They are Viking… just like you.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.035
No.

27:43.912 --> 27:45.664
We are Greenlanders,

27:46.706 --> 27:47.916
as are you.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.003
Until this morning, no one among us

27:52.087 --> 27:54.339
had seen more than
40 people together in one place.

27:54.422 --> 27:57.509
Now, I look at more men
than in Iceland and Greenland together.

28:00.095 --> 28:04.140
We must be able to admit that
what we came here for is now hopeless.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.226
[solemn instrumental music playing]

28:12.941 --> 28:13.942
[sighs]

28:32.961 --> 28:34.421
[horses neighing in distance]

28:35.004 --> 28:35.922
[sighs]

28:44.264 --> 28:45.265
[Leif sighs]

28:47.642 --> 28:49.811
You shouldn't have
stopped me in the harbor.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.105
It would be done.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.024
And you would be dead.

28:56.776 --> 28:59.070
Then I'd be in Valhalla
with the other Einherjar,

29:00.280 --> 29:02.157
feasting with Odin and the Gods.

29:05.368 --> 29:06.870
And Father would be proud.

29:12.375 --> 29:15.545
I didn't come all the way from Greenland
to make Father proud.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.048
I came here for you.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.681
So, what are you trying to tell me?

29:27.932 --> 29:29.058
That it's hopeless?

29:30.560 --> 29:33.313
Because I will not stop until
I get my revenge and you know that.

29:35.648 --> 29:36.566
No.

29:39.569 --> 29:40.945
I'm asking you to trust me.

29:51.456 --> 29:52.457
[Leif sighs]

29:54.667 --> 29:57.003
-[excited chatter]
-[upbeat folk music playing]

29:58.129 --> 29:59.214
How are you, brother?

30:00.423 --> 30:01.716
[indistinct conversation]

30:14.103 --> 30:15.188
[Harald] May I come in?

30:16.981 --> 30:19.943
Have you come to tell me
Canute has changed his mind?

30:20.026 --> 30:21.027
No.

30:23.613 --> 30:26.115
Then what do we have to talk about?

30:27.408 --> 30:28.535
Our brother, Sten.

30:30.036 --> 30:32.747
Half-brother, like you.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.335
Do not tell me you're not close to him.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.129
You served together in the Kingsguard.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.091
You're godfather to his children,

30:43.758 --> 30:45.552
both of whom were killed in the slaughter.

30:47.720 --> 30:48.805
Yes.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.641
And I pray for their souls every night.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.895
But do you not feel
even the slightest obligation

30:55.979 --> 30:57.188
to avenge their murders?

30:59.941 --> 31:02.235
Revenge is the motive of the heathen.

31:03.236 --> 31:05.196
My Savior, Christ, forbids it.

31:07.490 --> 31:10.285
Your Savior has no problem
with English gold, however.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.411
[scoffs]

31:11.494 --> 31:14.372
You know more about the English
than just their defenses.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.208
You know about their wealth.

31:18.835 --> 31:22.046
Canute will not change his plans
to accommodate your piety.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.466
And when he conquers England,

31:25.550 --> 31:28.094
he will use those riches
to expand his empire.

31:29.053 --> 31:33.016
And what will all your saintliness
have achieved for you?

31:36.102 --> 31:41.357
I urge you to take a broader view
of your Christian mission, half-brother.

31:42.400 --> 31:46.571
It may better serve you
and your Savior in the long run.

31:54.746 --> 31:55.705
He knows you well.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.419

[man gasps]

32:34.869 --> 32:37.121
[in English] What you doing over here?

32:37.205 --> 32:39.791
Come with me before one of these
damn Christians spots you.

32:40.500 --> 32:41.417
[Leif grunts]

32:42.919 --> 32:43.753
Go.

32:49.676 --> 32:52.845
If that Jesus bunch caught you
prowling around over there,

32:52.929 --> 32:54.639
you'll be lucky to get back.

32:55.264 --> 32:57.600
Here, help me with these.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.602
[drums beating in distance]

33:07.068 --> 33:08.820
[priest speaking foreign language]

33:16.411 --> 33:17.870
[men in English] Amen.

[drum beats stop]

34:05.001 --> 34:06.294
[men coughing]

34:07.003 --> 34:08.212
Welcome, friends!

34:08.296 --> 34:09.714
[indistinct chatter]

34:11.549 --> 34:13.718
Over a hundred years ago,

34:14.302 --> 34:19.432
a great Viking army set off for England
to avenge the death of Ragnar Lothbrok.

34:21.392 --> 34:22.852
It achieved its goal.

34:24.812 --> 34:27.315
And after many great victories,

34:27.398 --> 34:31.319
our people were invited
to settle into communities there.

34:33.154 --> 34:39.535
With time, we sent our loved ones
to live and work there.

34:41.329 --> 34:44.832
The Danelaw became their home.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.042
[crowd murmuring]

34:48.002 --> 34:49.295
A year ago,

34:51.130 --> 34:52.882
all that changed.

34:54.675 --> 34:56.886
And a slaughter began.

34:57.887 --> 34:59.013
A massacre.

35:00.056 --> 35:02.934
Unknown in the long history of our people.

35:04.268 --> 35:05.228
An attack.

35:06.687 --> 35:08.314
Not warrior to warrior.

35:10.108 --> 35:13.444
But waged on innocent women and children.

35:13.528 --> 35:14.946
[crowd murmuring]

35:17.698 --> 35:21.119
Waged for only one reason.

35:22.578 --> 35:27.458
To cleanse England of our people.

35:29.752 --> 35:33.881
You have been summoned here for a purpose,

35:35.716 --> 35:39.095
to avenge the death of our people

35:40.638 --> 35:45.810
and to show the English
that they cannot murder Vikings

35:45.893 --> 35:49.188
and expect us to do nothing!

35:49.272 --> 35:50.857
[crowd cheering]

35:52.733 --> 35:55.403
Our ancestors would not.

35:56.195 --> 36:00.324
Ivar "the Boneless"
and Bjorn "Ironside" would not.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.870
I will not.

36:08.374 --> 36:09.292
Will you?

36:09.375 --> 36:12.336
[all] No!

36:15.840 --> 36:19.385
You are here for your families!

36:20.303 --> 36:22.972
You are here for your honor!

36:24.348 --> 36:29.270
You are here because you are Vikings!

36:29.353 --> 36:30.396
[cheering]

36:41.115 --> 36:43.618
Ah! [chuckles]

36:48.039 --> 36:49.582
We will fight the English,

36:50.458 --> 36:53.211
but not with Christians!

36:53.294 --> 36:55.796
-[men clamoring]
-Christians killed my family.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.675
They are my true enemy.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.429
And you are mine, Pagan.

37:04.805 --> 37:07.183
These men are nothing but idolaters.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.601
[men] Yeah!

37:08.684 --> 37:10.895
Worshippers of Satan.

37:10.978 --> 37:13.022
Worship this! [yells]

37:13.105 --> 37:14.398
[men shouting]

37:16.400 --> 37:17.276
Yes! Come on!

[grunting]

37:26.535 --> 37:27.703
[yells]

37:28.454 --> 37:29.372
Enough!

37:29.455 --> 37:30.665
[all panting]

37:31.457 --> 37:32.416
Jarl Gorm!

37:33.292 --> 37:35.419
You say you'll
never fight with Christians.

37:35.503 --> 37:36.921
But what am I?

37:38.214 --> 37:41.759
Did I not spend every summer
of my youth with your family?

37:42.385 --> 37:44.178
Did you not love me like a son?

37:44.262 --> 37:46.597
[solemn instrumental music playing]

37:46.681 --> 37:49.934
Jarl Nori, a pious Christian.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.771
I saw your sister
the night of the massacre.

37:54.814 --> 37:58.150
What would she say about your refusal
to fight with your brothers here?

37:58.234 --> 38:00.278
Would she not call you a coward?

38:03.656 --> 38:07.201
That your God is Odin or Christ

38:07.785 --> 38:09.287
means nothing to me!

38:11.289 --> 38:15.001
Only your honor does!
Only your courage does!

38:21.090 --> 38:22.091
This blood…

38:23.467 --> 38:25.219
It's not my blood.

38:26.220 --> 38:30.433
It is our blood, it is Viking blood!

38:30.516 --> 38:33.060
-[men cheering]
-And it will always be!

38:36.439 --> 38:40.067
We are with you, Harald Sigurdsson.

38:43.404 --> 38:44.322
As are we.

38:47.116 --> 38:48.701
[cheering continues]

38:57.626 --> 38:58.544
Oh!

Freydis Eriksdotter.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.002
Erik… from Jaren?

40:25.423 --> 40:28.467
Do not worry. I was a friend.

40:30.553 --> 40:31.512
Where is he now?

40:32.763 --> 40:34.390
With the army on the plain below?

40:34.473 --> 40:35.433
No.

40:36.475 --> 40:38.978
In Greenland, where we live.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.648
You're a long way from home, Freydis.

40:43.649 --> 40:44.984
What is your business here?

40:45.734 --> 40:47.153
I am on a mission.

40:48.487 --> 40:49.613
I can say no more.

40:50.739 --> 40:53.868
This is no longer a land safe
for believers in the old ways.

40:53.951 --> 40:55.661
Only Kattegat is safe.

40:57.872 --> 41:01.917
When you see your father again,
tell him hello from Estrid Haakon.

41:03.335 --> 41:04.628
He will remember me.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.021
[grunts]

41:22.104 --> 41:23.105
[gasps]

41:28.694 --> 41:29.862
[Freydis panting]

41:31.238 --> 41:32.406
[Freydis] Is Leif back?

41:33.157 --> 41:33.991
[man] No.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.912
The army is moving.

41:41.123 --> 41:44.168
What do we do? Should we wait for Leif?

41:44.251 --> 41:46.712
No. He already told me what to do.

41:48.214 --> 41:49.381
We go to Kattegat.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.926
[men singing in Nordic]

41:52.009 --> 41:53.427
[indistinct chatter]

41:54.720 --> 41:56.347
[men continue singing in Nordic]

42:25.876 --> 42:28.754
[in English] It's him, all right.
It's Eriksson.

42:28.837 --> 42:31.757
Your father is Erik Thorvaldson, yes?
Erik the Red?

42:31.840 --> 42:33.092
And what is that to you?

42:33.175 --> 42:34.677
Our name is Becken.

42:34.760 --> 42:36.887
Your father killed our brother Sven.

42:38.430 --> 42:40.599
My father's history
has nothing to do with me.

42:40.683 --> 42:42.560
Your father is a killer.

42:42.643 --> 42:45.813
Ran away to escape justice.
It has everything to do with you.

42:46.397 --> 42:47.606
You're making a mistake.

42:47.690 --> 42:48.774
No, Eriksson.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.902
The mistake was yours. [grunts]

42:53.028 --> 42:54.405
[both grunting]

42:56.782 --> 42:57.950
[man] Get him!

43:00.661 --> 43:02.371
[grunting]

43:05.082 --> 43:06.292
[groaning]

43:06.834 --> 43:08.085
[grunting]

43:11.380 --> 43:12.631
[crowd clamoring]

43:24.977 --> 43:26.770
[man] Get him!

43:43.120 --> 43:44.371
[man breathing heavily]

43:47.708 --> 43:51.086
You heathen bastard.
You're just like your father.

43:51.754 --> 43:52.588
[Leif] You're wrong.

43:52.671 --> 43:53.589
[Leif grunts]

43:54.548 --> 43:57.259
If I was like my father,
you would all be dead.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.302
[groans softly]

44:03.140 --> 44:03.974
[slurps]

44:05.184 --> 44:06.018
[sighs]

44:13.776 --> 44:14.693
[Harald] Eriksson!

44:15.778 --> 44:16.820
From Greenland.

44:17.905 --> 44:20.949
Not the son of Viking warrior,
Erik Thorvaldson,

44:21.575 --> 44:24.078
banished from Norway
and Iceland for murder?

44:24.912 --> 44:25.746
The same.

44:28.123 --> 44:30.626
I suppose when you have
a father like Erik the Red,

44:31.460 --> 44:33.128
you learn to fight like that.

44:35.964 --> 44:37.091
My name is Leif.

44:39.301 --> 44:40.719
I'm Harald Sigurdsson.

44:42.012 --> 44:42.971
We met yesterday.

44:43.681 --> 44:44.932
Yes, I remember.

44:48.268 --> 44:49.645
And I heard you last night.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.399
You're a good speaker. You moved many.

44:55.734 --> 44:57.361
Did I move you?

44:59.530 --> 45:02.700
Freydis said you captained your boat
all the way from Greenland.

45:03.492 --> 45:05.744
Could use good ship captains
who can fight.

45:07.413 --> 45:10.374
I can promise great glory
if you join us in England.

45:10.457 --> 45:11.542
Glory?

45:13.794 --> 45:16.171
I thought you were
going to England for revenge.

45:17.214 --> 45:18.090
We are.

45:19.258 --> 45:21.719
But true Vikings always reach for glory.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.012
It's what defines us.

45:26.473 --> 45:28.392
Like I said, you're a good speaker.

45:30.352 --> 45:31.395
I'll think about it.

45:34.732 --> 45:35.858
By the way…

45:37.609 --> 45:38.736
Your sister.

45:40.529 --> 45:41.613
An amazing woman.

45:43.532 --> 45:45.200
I want to learn more about her.

45:47.911 --> 45:49.913
I think once she learns
that you're a Christian,

45:50.998 --> 45:52.916
you'll find out all you need to know.

45:55.002 --> 45:55.836
We'll see.

45:56.837 --> 45:57.796
[chuckles softly]

46:04.803 --> 46:06.013
Keep an eye on him.

46:09.349 --> 46:11.268
[gripping instrumental music playing]

46:24.323 --> 46:25.574
[man] Open the gates.

46:35.292 --> 46:36.668
Jarl Haakon.

46:37.294 --> 46:38.337
King Canute.

46:38.962 --> 46:42.090
I have come to request that
my army may camp outside your walls

46:42.174 --> 46:44.301
and depart for England from your harbor.

46:44.384 --> 46:47.554
You have my word
that your laws will be obeyed.

46:48.138 --> 46:49.556
Then your army is welcome.

46:50.140 --> 46:52.518
You and your men will be my guests.

46:55.604 --> 46:56.563
Forward.

47:15.916 --> 47:18.252
-[excited chatter]
-[upbeat folk music playing]

47:48.699 --> 47:49.825
[hissing]

47:52.578 --> 47:53.620
Mm.

47:58.166 --> 47:59.626
[indistinct conversation]

48:11.305 --> 48:12.973
I knew your husband, Jarl Haakon.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.268
He was a good man.

48:18.687 --> 48:21.690
It takes a strong person
to keep your city opened

48:21.773 --> 48:23.275
after what happened to him.

48:24.401 --> 48:28.280
Do not confuse tolerance
with forgiveness, King Canute.

48:28.363 --> 48:30.490
My eyes are always open.

48:35.996 --> 48:37.664
-[guard] Greenlander.
-What is this?

48:37.748 --> 48:39.291
You are not allowed in.

48:43.754 --> 48:45.464
[Njal and Liv grunting]

48:46.757 --> 48:47.633
[guard] Stay out!

48:50.636 --> 48:51.929
Out! Get out of here.

49:07.736 --> 49:08.654
[Canute] Friends!

49:11.990 --> 49:13.867
This is a historic occasion.

49:15.869 --> 49:17.579
Our thanks to Jarl Haakon

49:17.663 --> 49:21.291
for opening her city
to our righteous cause.

49:21.375 --> 49:22.584
[all cheering]

49:23.794 --> 49:27.506
It is an honor to be here in Kattegat,

49:27.589 --> 49:30.634
in the great hall
of Ragnar Lothbrok and his sons.

49:30.717 --> 49:31.843
[crowd cheering]

49:31.927 --> 49:34.221
To eat from the same table as Lagertha

49:34.304 --> 49:36.556
and all the heroes who came before.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.183
[all cheer]

49:38.266 --> 49:41.979
We are humbled
and inspired by their legacy.

49:42.854 --> 49:45.107
But now is our time to make history.

49:45.732 --> 49:47.776
To show the cowards in England

49:48.276 --> 49:51.571
that the Vikings, despite our differences,

49:52.322 --> 49:54.992
are still one people.

49:55.075 --> 49:56.159
[Gorm] Yes!

49:56.243 --> 49:57.494
One heart.

49:58.078 --> 49:58.954
[all] Yes!

49:59.037 --> 50:00.622
One soul.

50:00.706 --> 50:02.082
[all cheering]

50:03.667 --> 50:05.293
[suspenseful music playing]

50:11.341 --> 50:12.175
Good.

50:13.301 --> 50:15.053
I don't agree with all of it.

50:27.649 --> 50:29.526
That's close enough, Greenlander.

50:30.652 --> 50:33.280
Whatever you are planning,
do not act on it.

50:33.363 --> 50:34.906
I'll kill you if I must.

50:35.949 --> 50:37.993
I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

50:39.661 --> 50:41.288
[intense music playing]

50:41.997 --> 50:43.415
Hello, Christian.

50:46.084 --> 50:47.294
[Freydis grunts]

50:47.377 --> 50:48.336
[groans]

50:48.420 --> 50:50.881
Now it's my turn to give you a cross.

50:50.964 --> 50:51.923
[woman screams]

50:52.007 --> 50:52.883
[Gunnar groaning]

50:57.804 --> 50:58.847
[panting]

50:59.681 --> 51:01.099
Get her!

51:01.183 --> 51:02.100
[people clamoring]

51:03.977 --> 51:05.854
-No! No!
-[chuckles softly]

51:06.646 --> 51:07.898
[grunts]

51:09.149 --> 51:11.318
This is not your house, Jarl Olaf!

51:12.527 --> 51:15.697
Only I render judgment here.

51:16.531 --> 51:17.574
Do you allow murder?

51:19.284 --> 51:21.161
You all witnessed it.

51:21.244 --> 51:24.372
-[men shout in agreement]
-I demand justice!

51:24.456 --> 51:25.832
As do I!

51:27.584 --> 51:28.543
As do I.

51:29.294 --> 51:32.964
That man raped me. He was judged guilty
of his crimes in Greenland.

51:33.548 --> 51:35.425
I am within my right to take revenge.

51:35.509 --> 51:36.843
Lies!

51:36.927 --> 51:38.845
[man] She deserves to die!

51:38.929 --> 51:43.850
Punish her now
or we burn this city to the ground!

51:43.934 --> 51:44.810
[clamoring]

51:51.650 --> 51:52.943
[breathing heavily]

51:53.735 --> 51:57.364
Tell me again what I must do.

52:00.325 --> 52:04.454
I believe her! I believe her!

52:07.290 --> 52:08.208
You must show them.

52:11.294 --> 52:12.337
Let her up.

52:27.435 --> 52:29.354
He did this to her!

52:30.564 --> 52:34.693
If he were alive,
he would be forced to admit it.

52:34.776 --> 52:36.820
[man 1] Good riddance to him I say!

52:36.903 --> 52:39.990
-Silence!
-[man 2] Should be punished!

52:41.449 --> 52:43.410
I will render judgment in the morning.

52:45.078 --> 52:47.080
I stand with Jarl Haakon.

52:48.165 --> 52:51.626
We will await her ruling. Take them away.

52:52.127 --> 52:53.753
[people clamoring]
