00:16.559 --> 00:17.560
REPORTER: Federal authorities
have initiated

00:17.601 --> 00:19.145
a manhunt for William Butcher.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.980
SUSAN: It's Vought.
It's a fucking coup

00:21.021 --> 00:22.481
from the inside.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.983
I know who killed Raynor.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.526
Something to do with
the Supe terrorist

00:25.526 --> 00:26.569
smuggled into Jersey.

00:27.653 --> 00:28.821
Her brother.

00:28.863 --> 00:31.657
I just want me wife back.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.409
MALLORY:
Bring Langley the terrorist
and you'll have her.

00:35.286 --> 00:37.621
BECCA:
I was told he would never know
about Ryan or me.

00:37.663 --> 00:39.248
That was the deal.

00:39.290 --> 00:40.791
You need to make him leave.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.668
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna take Ryan

00:42.710 --> 00:43.919
and I'm gonna run.

00:43.961 --> 00:46.005
Superheroes are not born,
but made,

00:46.046 --> 00:47.673
via Compound V.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.508
We got a Supe terrorist
below deck

00:49.550 --> 00:52.553
and shit could go sideways
just like...

00:54.430 --> 00:56.557
(whale singing)

00:58.476 --> 01:00.394
Ah, fucking diabolical!

01:00.436 --> 01:01.729
(screams)

01:01.771 --> 01:03.481
(screaming)

01:05.733 --> 01:08.068
HOMELANDER:
I said he was mine.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.653
STORMFRONT:
You snooze, you lose, Gramps.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.030
REPORTER:
Our newest hero,

01:11.071 --> 01:13.115
Stormfront,
stopped the terrorist

01:13.157 --> 01:14.658
before he could take
more innocent lives.

01:17.161 --> 01:19.455
Communication is everything.

01:19.497 --> 01:21.165
Steve and I had been
dating for two years

01:21.207 --> 01:23.167
when he asked me to marry him.

01:23.209 --> 01:24.752
At the rehearsal dinner,
my dad said

01:24.794 --> 01:27.588
we should look into
a 529 account for our kids.

01:27.630 --> 01:29.715
Steve laughed
and said that was nuts

01:29.757 --> 01:31.342
and that we were
never having kids.

01:31.383 --> 01:34.178
(laughs)
Which was, um, news to me.

01:34.220 --> 01:36.806
Yeah. Long story short, um,

01:36.847 --> 01:38.933
the caterer was totally cool
with everything,

01:38.974 --> 01:42.061
but the Marriott did keep
our deposit on the banquet room.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.021
So... Yeah.

01:44.063 --> 01:45.481
Communication.

01:45.523 --> 01:49.068
("Le temps" by Kaaris playing)

01:55.241 --> 01:57.034
(clatters)

02:05.251 --> 02:07.670
...details are still emerging
about the Supe terrorist

02:07.711 --> 02:09.880
whose senseless attack
on an apartment building

02:09.922 --> 02:14.176
left 59 people dead
and over 100 injured.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.303
His name? Kenji Miyashiro,

02:16.345 --> 02:18.722
a Japanese expatriate
living in the Philippines.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.725
Miyashiro was radicalized
by the extremist group

02:21.767 --> 02:23.769
Shining Light Liberation Army.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.479
Witnesses who caught a glimpse
of the killer

02:25.521 --> 02:28.399
described him as dead-eyed
and unemotional

02:28.440 --> 02:31.402
as he rampaged through
the apartment building...

02:31.443 --> 02:34.405
It wasn't your fault.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.241
Many of the 59 victims
have not yet been identified...

02:37.283 --> 02:40.160
Kimiko, look at me.

02:40.202 --> 02:41.787
...to notify their families.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.706
Look at me.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.165
Investigators have
so far not disclosed

02:45.207 --> 02:46.667
further details
about the attack,

02:46.709 --> 02:48.377
but officials have announced

02:48.419 --> 02:51.422
they will hold a press
conference later this week.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.758
I-I didn't mean to.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.093
I'm sorry. I was just...

02:56.176 --> 02:58.053
(choking)

02:59.054 --> 03:01.056
(panting)

03:03.475 --> 03:05.311
NNC ANCHOR:
No one can debate

03:05.352 --> 03:06.937
that New Yorkers
owe their lives

03:06.979 --> 03:09.148
to the brave actions
taken by Stormfront.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.358
Earlier today,
Stormfront made an appearance

03:11.400 --> 03:13.360
at a New York City park.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.404
STORMFRONT:
How many more people
have to die?

03:15.446 --> 03:18.115
You guys, I have been shouting

03:18.157 --> 03:19.867
up and down
the hallways at Vought,

03:19.909 --> 03:21.911
and you know what they're doing
to stop another attack?

03:21.952 --> 03:24.204
Jack (bleep).

03:24.246 --> 03:25.956
Let's show Vought
what they have to do.

03:25.998 --> 03:28.208
Tomorrow morning,
Vought Square.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.587
(echoing): Be your own hero.
Make your voice heard.

03:31.629 --> 03:34.965
I am counting on you
to show us the way.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.675
Don't let me down.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.527
MADELYN:
There you are.

04:04.203 --> 04:06.622
I was beginning to worry.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.797
(moans)
I've missed you...

04:15.839 --> 04:18.634
...so much.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.471
Are you thirsty?

04:27.851 --> 04:29.853
(moaning softly)

04:35.109 --> 04:37.111
(grunts)

04:39.488 --> 04:42.157
My good boy.

04:47.371 --> 04:49.748
(siren wailing in distance)

05:11.020 --> 05:13.772
I ever tell you about
my recurring dream?

05:13.814 --> 05:18.027
I'm on stage, alone,
at Carnegie Hall.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.863
The audience is made up
of every poor bastard

05:20.904 --> 05:23.991
who got killed
by the superheroes.

05:24.033 --> 05:25.826
BUTCHER:
What are they doing?

05:27.244 --> 05:31.206
Nothing. They're all
just watching me.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.459
Waiting for me to do something.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.757
We hit a dead end on Raynor.

05:39.798 --> 05:41.133
I'm sorry.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.801
Christ, I don't want
to hear sorry.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.636
Sorry's not an option.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.473
We can't have anonymous
skull-exploding assassins

05:47.514 --> 05:49.099
walking around.

05:49.141 --> 05:50.726
What if they hit
the speaker next?

05:50.768 --> 05:52.770
Or the president?

06:02.071 --> 06:03.238
BUTCHER:
Liberty?

06:03.280 --> 06:04.865
You mentioned her before.

06:04.907 --> 06:07.117
Second-tier Supe,
active in the '70s.

06:07.159 --> 06:09.536
She was all over
Susan's private server.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.997
Get Marvin to talk
to this Liberty.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.125
Address on the back.
North Carolina.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.961
BUTCHER:
All right.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.089
We'll see what we can find.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.966
MALLORY:
Wait.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.808
I found Becca.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.603
Or, at least,
our best guess where she is.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.980
Vought facility,
armed to the teeth.

06:37.022 --> 06:38.607
Won't be easy.

06:38.649 --> 06:42.069
We had a deal.
I didn't come through.

06:42.111 --> 06:44.154
Jesus, Butcher,
I'm just giving it to you.

06:47.157 --> 06:51.537
It's my fault you stopped
searching for her.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.789
I put a target
on Homelander's back

06:53.831 --> 06:56.416
and pointed you right at him.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.336
I didn't know Becca was still...

07:02.131 --> 07:04.299
It'd be good to have
one less person

07:04.341 --> 07:06.552
in that audience staring at me.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.485
Hey!

07:24.486 --> 07:26.029
See?

07:26.071 --> 07:29.116
You get disrespected
over and over and over,

07:29.158 --> 07:30.576
that's what happens.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.412
I mean, how much shit
is he supposed to take?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.039
-Everybody respects you.
-(exhales)

07:37.541 --> 07:40.419
Fucking terrorist was my save,
not hers.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.045
It was mine.

07:43.881 --> 07:47.843
What? Now that-that media whore
i-is the face of The Seven?

07:47.885 --> 07:50.053
-No, she's not. No, you are.
-Come on.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.514
And it's not just her,
it-it's the entire team.

07:52.556 --> 07:53.932
-No.
-Yes, it is.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.477
It-It's a whole chain
of weak links.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.188
(sighs)

07:59.229 --> 08:02.191
I-It's very hard
not to take it personally.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.067
-Oh, I know.
-(exhales)

08:04.109 --> 08:06.778
I know.
(shushes)

08:06.820 --> 08:08.822
(grunts)

08:08.864 --> 08:12.034
I'll tell you one thing.

08:12.075 --> 08:15.704
-You wouldn't put up
with this shit.
-Mm-mm.

08:15.746 --> 08:18.582
One little raise of the eyebrow,
and you would've knocked them

08:18.624 --> 08:20.584
-all back in line.
-Yeah.

08:20.626 --> 08:23.587
God, I miss that about you.

08:23.629 --> 08:27.007
You don't need me to do that.

08:27.049 --> 08:30.594
The Seven is your team.

08:30.636 --> 08:33.931
You nurtured them,
you watered and fed them.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.557
-That's-- I did.
-Yes,

08:35.599 --> 08:39.394
and if they can't
respect that or you,

08:39.436 --> 08:43.523
well, it may be time
to tear out the weeds

08:43.565 --> 08:46.026
and start all over again.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.615
(grunting, groaning)

08:54.785 --> 08:55.994
(gasps)

08:57.037 --> 08:59.539
Change back. Change back!

08:59.581 --> 09:01.959
I'm sorry! I can only hold
a shape for so long

09:02.000 --> 09:04.086
before it really hurts.

09:04.127 --> 09:08.382
Change the fuck back now,
Doppelganger!

09:09.383 --> 09:10.467
(straining)

09:10.509 --> 09:12.261
(Madelyn shouts, exhales)

09:13.512 --> 09:16.098
Yeah, it's okay. Come here.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.350
It's all good.

09:18.392 --> 09:20.894
Oh, my little boy. Come on.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.897
Okay.
(panting)

09:23.939 --> 09:25.941
It's okay.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.322
I love you.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.034
I love you.

09:36.076 --> 09:40.038
You're the most powerful man
in the whole wide world.

09:40.080 --> 09:44.293
And there's nothing
that you cannot do.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.135
MOTHER'S MILK:
Storming an off-the-books
Vought compound alone?

09:53.176 --> 09:56.513
Butcher, how is it possible that
you're dumber than you look?

09:56.555 --> 09:59.474
-Mate, it's Becca.
-No shit.

09:59.516 --> 10:01.685
But win or lose,
you ain't coming back.

10:01.727 --> 10:02.894
Course I am.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.064
That's bullshit.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.066
Look, it's not like Vought's

10:08.108 --> 10:10.027
gonna let us settle down
in Orlando.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.820
We got to get gone
and stay gone.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.822
What about us? Hmm?

10:13.864 --> 10:15.866
We're the Spice Girls, right?

10:17.576 --> 10:20.954
You're in charge now.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.456
Mazel tov.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.292
Motherfucker,
I don't want to be in charge.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.794
Matter of fact,
I don't even want to be here.

10:27.836 --> 10:29.463
I gave up my family for this.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.089
For you.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.507
When do I get them back?

10:32.549 --> 10:35.052
You find this Liberty slag.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.429
See what you can rumble.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.514
You jump through a few hoops
for the colonel,

10:39.556 --> 10:41.683
and she'll help you
the same way she helped me.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.353
She always liked
you more, anyway.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.607
And what about Frenchie?

10:48.648 --> 10:51.485
He's been high as kite for days.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.529
-He won't even notice I'm gone.
-Hmm.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.989
And Hughie?

10:59.618 --> 11:01.203
Kid's a weeper.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.663
Don't want him to get snot
all over me jacket.

11:26.144 --> 11:28.146
♪ ♪

11:36.571 --> 11:38.323
(elevator bell chimes)

11:48.542 --> 11:50.544
Hey, Homelander.

12:02.139 --> 12:04.224
(low thudding)

12:10.772 --> 12:14.317
Maeve begged me

12:14.359 --> 12:17.737
to spare your life.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.907
So I gave you a second chance,

12:20.949 --> 12:25.120
and... you failed me.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.790
What are you talking about?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.962
No more lies.

12:34.004 --> 12:37.048
(screams, grunting)

12:38.091 --> 12:40.427
You go ahead and scream.

12:40.469 --> 12:43.472
As much as you want.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.059
What... what did I do?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.728
I told you
to kill Hugh Campbell,

12:49.769 --> 12:51.146
and you hesitated.

12:51.188 --> 12:53.857
I-I said that we should
go to the police.

12:53.899 --> 12:58.236
You disobeyed my orders
because you're with him.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.074
Fuck you.

13:04.701 --> 13:07.662
Hughie Campbell broke
my fucking heart.

13:07.704 --> 13:11.082
Worse than anyone ever has.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.503
And part of me wants to blast
his fucking face off,

13:14.544 --> 13:18.715
so no, I'm not "with him."

13:18.757 --> 13:23.553
But if you want to kill me
because I'm not a murderer

13:23.595 --> 13:26.515
and I won't
straight-up execute someone,

13:26.556 --> 13:28.558
then go ahead.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.853
So, tell me,

13:31.895 --> 13:35.106
am I lying?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.321
(elevator bell chimes)

13:41.363 --> 13:43.365
You're not lying.

Ooh.

Black Noir. Hi.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.888
Would you like an Almond Joy?

14:24.322 --> 14:28.326
Um, do you mean William Butcher?

14:31.037 --> 14:33.415
-Okay.
-(tapping keyboard)

14:36.751 --> 14:40.589
Well, he was definitely
on the yacht with the terrorist.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.216
Some of his known accomplices
were, too.

14:43.258 --> 14:46.136
We lost him
in these storm tunnels.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.471
So, yeah.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.765
There you go.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.726
I'll keep you posted
when we find them.

14:56.229 --> 14:59.065
Or I can look right now.

14:59.107 --> 15:02.402
Just, uh, run
a facial recognition search.

15:02.444 --> 15:05.196
(tapping keyboard)

15:06.239 --> 15:08.158
Or you can join me.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.161
(birds chirping)

15:15.498 --> 15:18.376
-Hey.
-(chuckles)

15:18.418 --> 15:20.962
-Thanks for coming.
-Hey.

15:21.004 --> 15:25.050
-Oh, you're so bruised.
-Oh, no, it's fine. It's okay.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.301
That was all me?

15:26.343 --> 15:28.511
It's cool. Really.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.972
I mean, you know,
chicks dig bruises.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.515
You know, I was in...
When I was in fifth grade,

15:32.557 --> 15:34.309
I took a tetherball to the face.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.894
And Amy Burtenshaw,
she brought me

15:35.935 --> 15:38.104
Jell-O Pudding Pops
for, like, two weeks.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.648
I'm talking way too much.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.109
I could've killed you.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.113
But you didn't.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.325
Um...

15:50.367 --> 15:54.996
(clears throat)
I got your voice mail.

15:55.038 --> 15:57.832
Oh, God. Can... Oh, God.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.293
Can we just chalk that up
to a-a drunk dial?

16:00.335 --> 16:03.421
I-I'm okay, really,
it's just, uh...

16:03.463 --> 16:05.006
Do you just mind, you mind

16:05.048 --> 16:06.925
-if we just
don't talk about it?
-Okay.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.344
So, we got the Compound V
out there,

16:09.386 --> 16:10.720
and Vought is still kicking,

16:10.762 --> 16:13.515
so we risked our lives

16:13.556 --> 16:17.435
just to make the world
way worse.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.271
Yeah, but no, no, no.
That's not true.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.149
I mean, you know,
these things, they...

16:23.191 --> 16:25.568
Look, Annie, they take time.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.987
(sighs)
How much time?

16:29.030 --> 16:31.157
(phone ringing)

16:31.199 --> 16:32.617
Just...

16:35.036 --> 16:36.413
Sorry, just give me one second.

16:36.454 --> 16:39.457
Um... Hey, M.M.

16:41.543 --> 16:44.963
Raleigh? Like, the one
in North Carolina?

16:46.506 --> 16:48.341
Yeah, okay, okay.
Jesus, I was just asking.

16:48.383 --> 16:52.011
Um, yeah. Yeah.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.139
Um, just pick me up

16:54.180 --> 16:57.183
at, like, 81st
and-and Central Park West.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.687
Okay, okay, all right.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.898
Um, I have to go.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.191
What's going on?

17:06.234 --> 17:07.861
Can I call you later?

17:15.118 --> 17:16.745
(sniffs)

17:17.787 --> 17:19.914
Are you just gonna...

17:19.956 --> 17:21.666
hang out?

17:21.708 --> 17:23.376
Here?

17:23.418 --> 17:25.044
Yeah, I...

17:25.086 --> 17:28.047
I just... I can't go back
to the Tower right now.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.341
Why? What happened?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.844
I can't...

17:32.886 --> 17:35.472
(crying):
I can't do this anymore.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.566
MOTHER'S MILK:
Are you fucking insane?

17:46.608 --> 17:49.110
She can't come with us,
Hughie. She's chipped.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.821
So, I have a second cousin
who lives around there.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.741
I could tell Vought
that I'm going to visit.

17:54.783 --> 17:57.035
HUGHIE:
And we'd be out of the city,
away from the cameras.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.244
I mean, no one would see us.

17:58.286 --> 18:02.540
No. Even her standing here
is dangerous.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.626
Maybe he's right. I...
(sighs)

18:04.667 --> 18:06.461
This is a bad idea.

18:10.006 --> 18:12.550
If we're gonna go knock
on some Supe's door,

18:12.592 --> 18:14.594
don't you think it makes
a little bit of sense

18:14.636 --> 18:18.056
for us to have one of our own?

18:18.097 --> 18:19.808
(quietly):
Look, she's in rough shape.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.310
She needs this.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.148
You mean you need this?

18:35.240 --> 18:38.201
Hey. How you doing? Cool.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.994
-What's up, man?
-(elevator bell chimes)

18:50.255 --> 18:52.465
(quietly):
Oh, fuck!

18:52.507 --> 18:54.467
Don't bullshit me,

18:54.509 --> 18:57.929
-Ashley.
-Shockwave is just here
to talk about Vought for Tots.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.180
I swear to God.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.349
What the fuck is
Vought for Tots?

19:01.391 --> 19:03.476
It's a new fitness outreach
for toddlers.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.144
Apparently,
they're getting obese.

19:05.186 --> 19:08.189
Well, shit, I fucking love
fat kids. Use me.

19:08.231 --> 19:10.608
Oh, good, you're here.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.235
You tell him yet?

19:13.236 --> 19:14.737
Tell me what?

19:14.779 --> 19:17.282
I thought we were gonna have
a strategy meeting.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.449
A-Train, you're out.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.701
Out of what?

19:19.742 --> 19:21.494
Out of The Seven.

19:21.536 --> 19:24.289
You did great, but we're going
in a different direction, so...

19:24.330 --> 19:26.374
you're out.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.126
What the fuck?

19:28.167 --> 19:29.878
You just said
everything was fine.

19:29.919 --> 19:32.422
You're gonna have a whole year
of parades.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.007
Tribute concerts.

19:34.048 --> 19:35.842
You're gonna hit
the talk show circuit.

19:35.884 --> 19:37.802
You're-you're gonna have
your own reality show

19:37.844 --> 19:39.137
on Vought+.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.014
The outpouring of love
and gratitude

19:41.055 --> 19:42.181
is gonna be off the charts.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.767
Oh, this is bullshit!

19:44.809 --> 19:47.854
You used to get
my fucking coffee!

19:50.106 --> 19:53.067
Oh, fuck this. I'm not going.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.862
A-Train... you can't run.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.989
Yes, I can run.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.949
-I just... I-I just...
-Buddy?

19:59.991 --> 20:03.036
(quietly): You think I don't
know what's been going on?

20:03.077 --> 20:06.664
It's your heart.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.250
I doubt you're even cracking
the top 20 anymore,

20:09.292 --> 20:12.295
and that makes The Seven--
me-- look pretty ridiculous.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.048
I do want you to know, though,

20:15.089 --> 20:16.341
this was really hard for me.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.550
Okay?

20:17.592 --> 20:18.927
It's nothing personal.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.304
Uh, we'll always be friends
and, uh...

20:21.346 --> 20:23.765
(sighs)
Et cetera.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.767
Attaboy.

20:27.769 --> 20:30.980
(door opens, closes)

20:42.867 --> 20:45.954
Does anyone mind
if I put on some music?

20:45.995 --> 20:46.996
Yeah.

20:49.082 --> 20:52.085

21:45.805 --> 21:47.724
Y'all ain't on no date, either.

21:47.765 --> 21:50.184
Just... chill.

21:50.226 --> 21:53.980
I'm not your goddamn chaperone.
(scoffs)

21:58.484 --> 22:00.236
CASSANDRA:
They say if you love someone,

22:00.278 --> 22:03.906
you should set them free.
But that seems crazy to me,

22:03.948 --> 22:07.452
because if you love someone,
you will never let them go.

22:07.493 --> 22:08.870
Never.

22:08.911 --> 22:11.914
Have you heard of
the Lovers of Valdaro?

22:11.956 --> 22:14.167
They were alive, like,
6,000 years ago,

22:14.208 --> 22:16.461
and they were found
in this tomb in Italy.

22:16.502 --> 22:20.923
These two skeletons with
their arms around each other.

22:22.008 --> 22:25.053
That's love.
(laughs)

22:50.244 --> 22:52.455
(softly):
Open up the door.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.126
Bonjour.

22:57.168 --> 22:59.462
You smell like a wet dog.

22:59.504 --> 23:01.923
Oh, you want a drink?

23:01.964 --> 23:03.466
Mm-mm.

23:03.508 --> 23:05.760
Whoa.
Who says I'm alone, asshole?

23:19.899 --> 23:23.486
So... are you gonna
tell me what's wrong?

23:23.528 --> 23:26.531
Or you just gonna
stain my clean sheets

23:26.572 --> 23:28.407
with your sweaty despair?

23:30.493 --> 23:32.537
I tried to kiss her.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.497
Kimiko?

23:34.539 --> 23:36.582
Her brother died.

23:36.624 --> 23:39.502
I wanted to
make her feel better.

23:39.544 --> 23:41.420
You thought a kiss
would make her feel better

23:41.462 --> 23:42.630
or you feel better?

23:42.672 --> 23:45.258
She was in pain.
I wanted to help.

23:45.299 --> 23:47.426
You always want to help.

23:47.468 --> 23:48.636
So?

23:48.678 --> 23:51.347
(exhales)
You think

23:51.389 --> 23:53.724
that by saving her,

23:53.766 --> 23:55.143
you can make amends

23:55.184 --> 23:57.770
for all the people you hurt.

23:59.605 --> 24:04.402
For those children
that Lamplighter burned.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.613
-Okay.
-You don't know anything.

24:10.324 --> 24:13.703
Look, she's not a kitten
up a tree.

24:15.538 --> 24:19.333
Just leave her alone. Hmm?

24:19.375 --> 24:21.836
Let her grieve.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.882
What good does grieving
all alone ever do?

24:27.175 --> 24:29.093
VNN ANCHOR:
And in our continuing coverage

24:29.135 --> 24:31.679
of the recent revelations
over Compound V,

24:31.721 --> 24:32.930
protesters all over
the Middle East

24:32.972 --> 24:33.973
have taken to the streets
demanding...

24:34.015 --> 24:36.142
-Thank you.
-I'll be right back.

24:36.184 --> 24:38.186
(anchor continues indistinctly)

24:42.565 --> 24:45.026
Meanwhile,
at the United Nations,

24:45.067 --> 24:46.903
governments from all over the
world have voiced their anger

24:46.944 --> 24:49.322
at the Compound V revelation.

24:49.363 --> 24:51.199
-Mm.
-Today, Russia and China

24:51.240 --> 24:54.118
referred to the superheroes
as weapons of mass destruction

24:54.160 --> 24:56.871
-and accused the United States
of terrorism...
-Mm.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.998
You two want a room?

25:01.042 --> 25:03.419
You and the doughnut.

25:03.461 --> 25:05.087
Oh.
(laughs)

25:05.129 --> 25:06.380
I'm sorry.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.965
It's just, um,

25:08.007 --> 25:11.677
my mom never let me
have this stuff.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.805
-Hmm.
-It's just-- Weight gain
in our household

25:14.847 --> 25:16.724
was a capital crime.

25:16.766 --> 25:19.477
But my dad, um,

25:19.518 --> 25:21.187
he'd take me to Dunkin'
on the sly.

25:21.229 --> 25:25.775
And he would get me a chocolate
cream-filled doughnut,

25:25.816 --> 25:29.237
and he'd ask me
to tell him about my day.

25:33.407 --> 25:37.411
And he'd... he'd listen.

25:40.498 --> 25:41.832
Baskin-Robbins.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.628
Every Sunday after church.

25:47.672 --> 25:50.049
My pops, he'd always ask

25:50.091 --> 25:51.592
for samples.

25:51.634 --> 25:54.845
Now, this place had 31 flavors,

25:54.887 --> 25:58.182
and that man would taste
each and every flavor

25:58.224 --> 26:00.351
every time we'd go up in there.

26:00.393 --> 26:01.936
There'd be a line
all the way out the door.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.938
People would be mad as hell.
Yelling.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.606
-(laughing)
-Cussing. "Yo, my man,

26:05.648 --> 26:07.942
get your fucking ice cream
and bounce!"

26:07.984 --> 26:09.610
You think that stopped him?

26:09.652 --> 26:11.529
Hell, nah.
He would stand right there

26:11.570 --> 26:13.155
and order another sample.

26:13.197 --> 26:16.450
"Can I please try the Jamoca
Almond Fudge, please?"

26:16.492 --> 26:18.244
(Starlight chuckles)

26:18.286 --> 26:20.454
My ass was so embarrassed.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.164
I'd be sitting there,
wishing the floor

26:22.206 --> 26:24.834
would just open up
and just swallow me whole.

26:24.875 --> 26:27.503
Man.

26:27.545 --> 26:31.007
Course, now I'd give a year off
my life just to be able

26:31.048 --> 26:33.134
to see that man going through
spoon after spoon

26:33.175 --> 26:35.886
just one last time.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.433
When did he...

26:40.474 --> 26:41.976
16 years ago.

you're not cleaning anything.

he taps the steering wheel
three times.

actually, I think I went

33:49.611 --> 33:51.572
the other way with the eating.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.408
I think I lost,
like, seven pounds.

33:54.450 --> 33:55.826

35:34.091 --> 35:37.469
"Shape of You," "Galway Girl,"
whole catalog.

35:37.511 --> 35:39.596

35:42.683 --> 35:44.184
(smacks lips)

41:22.856 --> 41:25.317
Let's talk #HeroesSoWhite.

41:25.358 --> 41:27.861
The numbers are
rather startling.

41:27.903 --> 41:29.988
92% of heroes are Caucasian.

41:30.030 --> 41:32.991
African American, six percent.

41:33.033 --> 41:35.952
Latin and Asian,
each one percent.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.622
Why doesn't Vought
want diversity?

41:38.663 --> 41:42.626
Wow. These are real hardballs,
Maria Menounos.

41:42.667 --> 41:43.668
(weak chuckles)

41:43.710 --> 41:45.712
But check your facts.

41:45.754 --> 41:48.673
Let's, uh, take The Seven,
for example.

41:48.715 --> 41:50.467
We've got A-Train.
He's a black man.

41:50.508 --> 41:54.262
We got Black Noir. He, um...

41:54.304 --> 41:56.848
Well, he doesn't identify
with any race, really,

41:56.890 --> 41:59.434
so... they're covered.
(chuckles)

41:59.476 --> 42:02.938
And... we have a gay hero.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.232
Really?

42:05.273 --> 42:07.359
Who in The Seven is gay?

42:07.400 --> 42:09.986
Queen Maeve.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.989
Mm-hmm. Scoop for you, Maria.

42:13.031 --> 42:16.117
Maeve here is a strong,
proud lesbian

42:16.159 --> 42:19.371
with a beautiful girlfriend,
Elena.

42:19.412 --> 42:20.830
Hispanic girlfriend.

42:20.872 --> 42:25.085
And I, for one,
am so proud of her.

42:25.126 --> 42:27.128
MAEVE:
Where's Elena?

42:27.170 --> 42:29.714
What did you do to her?

42:29.756 --> 42:31.383
She's fine.

42:31.424 --> 42:34.177
What did I do to her?
I set her free.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.554
And you. You've been living
in the shadows so long,

42:36.596 --> 42:38.765
doesn't it feel good
to be out in the sun?

42:38.807 --> 42:40.600
Hold on.

42:40.642 --> 42:43.395
Me and Elena are just friends.

42:43.436 --> 42:45.772
-Oh. Just friends?
-Yes.

42:45.814 --> 42:47.399
Because, see, I heard you two
talking on the phone,

42:47.440 --> 42:49.943
and it sounded
a little more than friends.

42:49.985 --> 42:52.904
So, I did a little digging,

42:52.946 --> 42:55.615
and imagine my fucking surprise.

42:55.657 --> 42:57.951
Okay.

42:57.993 --> 43:00.954
-We had a relationship once.
-Hmm.

43:00.996 --> 43:03.373
Once. A relationship...
"Relationship."

43:03.415 --> 43:06.793
That's such a vague word.
What does that mean to you?

43:06.835 --> 43:08.795
What, long walks in the park?

43:08.837 --> 43:10.839
A shoulder to cry on?

43:10.880 --> 43:13.174
Scissoring each other raw?

43:13.216 --> 43:17.637
I ended the relationship
when I joined The Seven.

43:19.681 --> 43:20.807
When I met you.

43:20.849 --> 43:23.184
Stop fucking lying to me.

43:24.769 --> 43:29.274
I am at my wit's fucking end
with the lies.

43:31.818 --> 43:33.236
We're together.

43:33.278 --> 43:35.488
And you love her?

43:38.658 --> 43:41.036
Hmm.

43:41.077 --> 43:43.455
I see.

43:43.496 --> 43:46.333
Well, best of luck to you both.

43:48.585 --> 43:52.255
Oh, is it so hard to believe
that I want you two to be happy?

43:52.297 --> 43:54.507
And in love?

43:54.549 --> 43:57.093
Honestly, Maeve, I am

43:57.135 --> 44:01.765
really, really happy for you.

44:09.147 --> 44:11.149
(cheering, applause over TV)

44:13.276 --> 44:17.822
And have you seen
Vought's "Saving America" ads?

44:17.864 --> 44:22.202
Don't they make you feel all
warm and squishy and patriotic?

44:22.243 --> 44:24.662
(high-pitched ringing)

44:24.704 --> 44:28.792
Vought wants you
to feel calm and safe

44:28.833 --> 44:31.669
so that you continue to buy
their shitty toys

44:31.711 --> 44:34.089
and drinking
their shitty energy drinks

44:34.130 --> 44:36.591
-and going to see
their shitty movies.
-(booing)

44:36.633 --> 44:39.969
But maybe we shouldn't
feel so calm.

44:40.011 --> 44:42.138
Or safe.

44:42.180 --> 44:46.184
One Super terrorist
has already gotten through.

44:46.226 --> 44:47.852
More will come.

44:47.894 --> 44:49.521
And for all we know,

44:49.562 --> 44:52.357
these maniacs could already have
flown over our borders

44:52.399 --> 44:54.401
and be standing next to you,

44:54.442 --> 44:56.903
just waiting for their chance
to kill us all.

44:56.945 --> 44:58.488
So what are we gonna do?

44:58.530 --> 45:00.323
We're gonna sit around
and cross our fingers

45:00.365 --> 45:03.785
that Homelander's gonna save us
when he's not on Maria Menounos?

45:03.827 --> 45:05.286
CROWD:
No!

45:05.328 --> 45:07.205
STORMFRONT:
Or will we demand

45:07.247 --> 45:09.249
that Vought do better?

45:09.290 --> 45:11.084
(crowd cheering)

45:11.126 --> 45:14.003
That our government do better!

45:14.045 --> 45:15.672
What do you say?

45:15.713 --> 45:17.715
(cheering, applause)

45:24.431 --> 45:26.391
No.

45:26.433 --> 45:29.519
Mon coeur, please.
You will not survive.

45:29.561 --> 45:31.146
CROWD (chanting):
Stormfront! Stormfront!

45:31.187 --> 45:33.481
Stormfront! Stormfront!

45:35.608 --> 45:37.944
FAN:
Marry me, Stormfront!

45:37.986 --> 45:39.988
(shouting, cheering)

45:40.029 --> 45:42.782
Let's go home.

45:56.546 --> 45:58.548
(clears throat)

46:04.888 --> 46:06.764
-Hello?
-HUGHIE: Uh,

46:06.806 --> 46:09.267
hello, um...

46:09.309 --> 46:11.561
I'm Hughie.
Is-is there, by any chance,

46:11.603 --> 46:13.646
a woman living here
who used to go by the name

46:13.688 --> 46:15.690
of, um, Liberty?

46:17.650 --> 46:20.111
No.

46:20.153 --> 46:22.614
Okay, we have
the right address, right?

46:22.655 --> 46:24.240
Is that...?

46:34.542 --> 46:36.836
-Please leave.
-Miss,

46:36.878 --> 46:39.214
I'm sorry if my friend
offended you.

46:39.255 --> 46:41.257
But we just want to ask
just a couple of questions.

46:41.299 --> 46:43.301
Just leave me alone.

46:43.343 --> 46:46.137
I took your damn money,
I signed your damn papers,

46:46.179 --> 46:47.388
and I have kept my mouth shut.

46:47.430 --> 46:49.349
You think we're w...
We're not with Vought.

46:49.390 --> 46:51.100
Okay? We...
(laughs)

46:51.142 --> 46:53.228
We just want to learn
what we can about Liberty.

46:53.269 --> 46:54.521
That's it.

46:54.562 --> 46:57.190
Then y'all are just
some damn fools.

46:57.232 --> 46:58.816
It sounds like you know her.

46:58.858 --> 47:00.777
Or knew her.

47:00.818 --> 47:02.946
You're wasting your time.

47:02.987 --> 47:05.657
-Okay?
-Miss, Miss, Miss. Hear us out.

47:05.698 --> 47:08.826
If, after that,
you want us to leave, we'll go.

47:09.827 --> 47:12.163
Go ahead.

47:13.957 --> 47:17.377
My father was a lawyer.

47:17.418 --> 47:20.630
Small-time, very smart.
And aggressive.

47:20.672 --> 47:22.549
When I was a kid, something
happened between my family

47:22.590 --> 47:25.802
and Vought, which I'd rather not
talk about, but it was bad.

47:25.843 --> 47:28.846
Now, see, my dad,
he believed in the law

47:28.888 --> 47:33.059
and that nobody was above it,
not even Vought.

47:33.101 --> 47:36.312
So he went to work.
He got after their asses.

47:36.354 --> 47:38.398
He had one of those...

47:38.439 --> 47:40.191
Remember
those little black typewriters,

47:40.233 --> 47:41.568
manual ones with the keys?

47:41.609 --> 47:43.444
I'd go to sleep at night
to all that noise,

47:43.486 --> 47:45.154
my father banging away
at that thing.

47:45.196 --> 47:48.616
Wake up the next morning,
he'd still be hammering away.

47:48.658 --> 47:50.368
All night.

47:50.410 --> 47:53.037
But see, Vought wasn't about
to let this one black man

47:53.079 --> 47:54.664
put his foot on their necks.

47:54.706 --> 47:56.291
Mm-mm.

47:56.332 --> 47:59.043
So they hired teams of lawyers.

47:59.085 --> 48:00.920
Paid off judges.

48:00.962 --> 48:03.298
But my father never gave up.

48:03.339 --> 48:06.718
Till one morning
I woke up and...

48:06.759 --> 48:10.888
I didn't hear
those keys anymore.

48:10.930 --> 48:14.225
Just found him hunched over
that typewriter, dead at 55.

48:14.267 --> 48:16.227
WOMAN:
I'm so sorry for your loss.

48:16.269 --> 48:18.730
MOTHER'S MILK:
I'm not here for your sympathy.

48:18.771 --> 48:23.318
But I am gonna tell you that
his fight got passed down to me.

48:24.569 --> 48:27.030
And I'm gonna make Vought pay
for what they did to him

48:27.071 --> 48:28.406
and, ma'am, from what I gather,

48:28.448 --> 48:30.700
what they've done to you,
as well.

48:31.743 --> 48:35.288
I mean... it's been 48 years.

48:35.330 --> 48:37.915
What good is dredging
all this stuff up now gonna do?

48:37.957 --> 48:40.209
Honestly we don't know.

48:40.251 --> 48:41.878
But we still need to hear it.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.921
(sighs)

48:47.216 --> 48:49.802
I tried to get people to listen.

48:49.844 --> 48:53.723
(laughs): Lord knows,
so many times, I tried.

48:53.765 --> 48:56.601
But a little black girl accusing

48:56.643 --> 49:00.563
a white superhero of murder
in these parts?

49:00.605 --> 49:01.773
Yeah.

49:01.814 --> 49:04.484
(Valerie sighs)

49:04.525 --> 49:07.487
It was during
one of those summer rains

49:07.528 --> 49:09.447
that you just knew was coming

49:09.489 --> 49:11.449
by the smell in the air.

49:15.745 --> 49:18.790
I was 11 years old,

49:18.831 --> 49:22.043
asleep in the back seat
of my folks' Ford.

49:23.169 --> 49:25.380
My brother Myron,
he was driving.

49:26.381 --> 49:27.715
(tires screech)

49:27.757 --> 49:29.550
MYRON:
What's the trouble, ma'am?

49:29.592 --> 49:30.551
LIBERTY:
Get out.

49:30.593 --> 49:31.886
MYRON:
Hey.

49:31.928 --> 49:34.681
LIBERTY:
Your car was involved
in a robbery tonight.

49:34.722 --> 49:36.099
No, it wasn't. I-I had it.

49:36.140 --> 49:37.975
I don't know nothing
about any robbery.

49:38.017 --> 49:40.311
LIBERTY:
Just confess.

49:42.146 --> 49:43.231
MYRON:
Why are you doing this

49:43.272 --> 49:45.316
to me, lady?
Ain't you supposed to be a hero?

49:45.358 --> 49:46.901
LIBERTY:
I am a hero.

49:46.943 --> 49:49.570
For killing a black
piece of shit like you.

49:56.786 --> 49:58.204
(Myron wheezing softly)

50:03.584 --> 50:06.212
I wanted to go to the police.

50:06.254 --> 50:08.631
But my folks,

50:08.673 --> 50:11.217
they thought it was pointless.

50:11.259 --> 50:13.261
So when that man from Vought,

50:13.302 --> 50:17.348
when he showed up and he offered
us that money, we just took it.

50:18.391 --> 50:21.185
$2,000.

50:21.227 --> 50:24.605
That is what my brother's life
was worth.

50:24.647 --> 50:27.775
Just $2,000.

50:27.817 --> 50:29.777
But y'all have got to promise me

50:29.819 --> 50:32.780
that you won't tell anybody that
I sat here and I talked to you.

50:32.822 --> 50:35.616
Because if that woman finds out
that I opened my mouth,

50:35.658 --> 50:37.034
she's gonna kill me.

50:37.076 --> 50:39.036
Ms. Hunter,

50:39.078 --> 50:42.582
that woman, L-Liberty,

50:42.623 --> 50:45.793
n-nobody's seen her since 1979.

50:45.835 --> 50:47.378
I mean,
she's probably dead by now.

50:47.420 --> 50:49.213
(chuckles):
Oh, no, no.

50:49.255 --> 50:51.424
I...

50:51.466 --> 50:52.675
(mutters softly)

50:58.222 --> 51:00.183
Right here.

51:00.224 --> 51:02.894
That's her. Right there.

51:02.935 --> 51:04.854
That's Liberty.

51:10.276 --> 51:11.903
HUGHIE:
Valerie was just a little girl,

51:11.944 --> 51:14.405
and she said it was raining,
so she could be wrong.

51:14.447 --> 51:16.157
She seemed pretty certain.

51:16.199 --> 51:18.534
Yeah, but if Liberty and
Stormfront are the same person,

51:18.576 --> 51:20.328
then that makes Stormfront,
like, what, like, 70 years old?

51:20.369 --> 51:23.122
-More?
-Yeah, but who knows
what Compound V can do?

51:23.164 --> 51:26.334
I mean, maybe she doesn't age
like a regular person. Okay?

51:26.375 --> 51:28.127
This is the same Stormfront
that just became

51:28.169 --> 51:30.046
-America's favorite
two-fisted Supe.
-Mm-hmm.

51:30.087 --> 51:32.673
And might've popped Raynor's
head for getting too close.

51:32.715 --> 51:35.510
-Oh, my God.
-What the fuck is going on?

51:42.725 --> 51:44.769
I didn't know that
about your dad.

51:46.771 --> 51:48.731
Sounds like he was a real hero.

51:48.773 --> 51:52.235
I thought so, but...

51:53.277 --> 51:57.073
Nah. He's just a man
with a disease.

51:57.114 --> 52:00.034
He passed it down to me,
and if I'm not too careful,

52:00.076 --> 52:02.912
I might end up
passing it down to my...

52:09.669 --> 52:11.754
(sighs)

52:41.617 --> 52:44.537
HOMELANDER:
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

52:44.579 --> 52:47.331
What, you think I don't see it?

52:47.373 --> 52:50.585
Trying to undermine me,
steal my team...

52:50.626 --> 52:52.420
-Hold on a minute.
-Let me tell you right now,

52:52.461 --> 52:54.881
it won't work.

52:54.922 --> 52:57.967
I'm the face of The Seven!
Not you!

52:58.009 --> 53:01.012
Me. I still score higher
in every demo that counts.

53:01.053 --> 53:04.682
18 to 34, 18 to 49, 25 to 54,

53:04.724 --> 53:08.102
they all love me.

53:08.144 --> 53:11.105
Well, congratulations.

53:11.147 --> 53:15.318
I mean, this constant need
to be loved by everyone

53:15.359 --> 53:19.530
is kind of pathetic,
but, um, yay.

53:25.077 --> 53:27.371
Okay.

53:27.413 --> 53:31.083
(softly):
Okay. Calm down.

53:31.125 --> 53:34.378
I clearly pushed you
a little far. I'm sorry.

53:34.420 --> 53:37.924
Look, I'm... I'm just
trying to help.

53:37.965 --> 53:40.468
Really? How?

53:40.509 --> 53:43.095
By taking what's mine?

53:43.137 --> 53:45.014
Let me tell you something
right now:

53:45.056 --> 53:46.891
I built this team
from the ground up,

53:46.933 --> 53:49.477
and there is no fucking way
that anyone

53:49.518 --> 53:50.978
is gonna take it away from me.

53:51.020 --> 53:53.606
You spent $273 million

53:53.648 --> 53:55.358
on that "Saving America"
bullshit,

53:55.399 --> 53:57.151
and I am running circles
around you

53:57.193 --> 54:00.488
with five guys on laptops
churning out memes.

54:00.529 --> 54:03.532
I practically pay them
with Arby's gift cards.

54:03.574 --> 54:05.493
You...

54:05.534 --> 54:08.037
You can't win
the whole country anymore.

54:08.079 --> 54:10.039
No one can.

54:10.081 --> 54:12.416
So why are you even trying?

54:12.458 --> 54:16.087
You don't need 50 million people
to love you.

54:16.128 --> 54:20.132
You need five million people
fucking pissed.

54:20.174 --> 54:23.386
Emotion sells, anger sells.

54:23.427 --> 54:25.638
You have fans.

54:25.680 --> 54:27.974
I have soldiers.

54:29.976 --> 54:33.062
Look, I know that

54:33.104 --> 54:36.440
you probably won't believe this.

54:36.482 --> 54:38.567
I think that you

54:38.609 --> 54:40.611
are the best of us.

54:42.655 --> 54:44.240
I think that you

54:44.281 --> 54:49.036
are everything we should be.

54:49.078 --> 54:52.957
You just need a little help
connecting with your audience.

54:55.001 --> 54:57.128
You know, change with the times.

54:57.169 --> 54:59.422
God knows I did.

55:07.096 --> 55:10.516
I don't need help connecting
with my audience.

55:11.726 --> 55:12.977
Thank you.

55:13.019 --> 55:15.688
Okay. Well, just know
I'm always here,

55:15.730 --> 55:19.734
door is always open
for anything.

55:33.122 --> 55:35.124
You're late. Where's the kid?

55:38.377 --> 55:42.548
Babe, we got to get in the truck
or we'll miss our chance.

55:42.590 --> 55:44.300
I'm-I'm not leaving.

55:44.341 --> 55:45.551
What are you talking about?
Of course you are.

55:45.593 --> 55:46.927
Grab the kid and let's go.

55:46.969 --> 55:48.596
You don't really want Ryan
to come with us.

55:48.637 --> 55:50.514
Of course I do.
I said I'd take him, didn't I?

55:50.556 --> 55:52.975
And I wanted to believe you.

55:54.643 --> 55:59.023
Then believe me. Now come on,
we've got to get a shift on.

55:59.065 --> 56:01.442
Listen,
if the three of us leave,

56:01.484 --> 56:04.111
you're gonna find a way
to get rid of him.

56:04.153 --> 56:05.529
I know it. (stammers)

56:05.571 --> 56:07.448
It won't be in an obvious way,
and it won't be right away,

56:07.490 --> 56:09.075
-but you will.
-No, Becca, no.

56:09.116 --> 56:11.494
Billy, I know you.
I know you better than anybody,

56:11.535 --> 56:13.370
and I saw it
in your face last night.

56:13.412 --> 56:15.331
I see it now.

56:20.002 --> 56:23.130
He's a billion-dollar piece
of Vought property.

56:24.799 --> 56:26.967
They are not gonna let him go.

56:29.011 --> 56:32.473
You and me, Becca, you and me,
we've got a chance.

56:32.515 --> 56:35.017
Babe, it's Ryan
they care about, not us.

56:35.059 --> 56:36.560
Yeah, and then what?

56:36.602 --> 56:38.813
And then Vought raises him
without a mother, right?

56:38.854 --> 56:40.314
Then we have Homelander
all over again,

56:40.356 --> 56:42.024
then there's two fucking
assholes in this world.

56:42.066 --> 56:44.568
We could disappear, all right?
Just start again,

56:44.610 --> 56:46.195
-start a new family.
-I have a son!

56:46.237 --> 56:47.947
He's a fucking Supe freak.

56:49.907 --> 56:52.743
(sighs)
Fuck. I'm... Listen, I...

56:52.785 --> 56:56.163
I'm sorry, I d...
I didn't mean that.

56:56.205 --> 56:58.582
Becca.

56:58.624 --> 57:01.293
Becca, please come with me.

57:01.335 --> 57:04.713
You were wrong about me,
do you know that?

57:04.755 --> 57:06.966
You put me on this pedestal,

57:07.007 --> 57:10.970
and the truth is,
I never knew how to save you.

57:11.011 --> 57:13.222
You were always
one-one bad day away

57:13.264 --> 57:15.432
from pounding someone to death
in a parking lot.

57:15.474 --> 57:17.476
That's not true.

57:18.811 --> 57:21.313
Billy.

57:21.355 --> 57:24.900
He raped me, and when
I found out I was pregnant,

57:24.942 --> 57:27.903
I went to Vought.

57:27.945 --> 57:29.530
I didn't come to you.

57:31.699 --> 57:34.910
I didn't come to you
because I was scared,

57:34.952 --> 57:36.704
'cause I knew that
you'd chase after him

57:36.745 --> 57:40.249
and you would seek revenge and
it wouldn't be good for anybody.

57:40.291 --> 57:41.500
I love you.

57:41.542 --> 57:43.544
(crying):
I love you.

57:45.546 --> 57:48.090
But the hate that you carry

57:48.132 --> 57:51.552
and the warpath that you're on,

57:51.594 --> 57:54.263
it started so long before me.

57:56.307 --> 57:57.850
I can't.

58:09.945 --> 58:11.447
Becs, I'm not leaving
without you.

58:11.488 --> 58:13.908
You have to go, please.

58:14.950 --> 58:17.244
Every guard
in this goddamn place

58:17.286 --> 58:20.206
is gonna be here in 60 seconds.

58:20.247 --> 58:24.043
You have to go.
(crying)

58:24.084 --> 58:26.879
-I'm sorry.
-(car engine starts)

58:26.921 --> 58:29.840
I'm so sorry.

58:46.398 --> 58:48.192
Oh, shit.

58:59.745 --> 59:02.498
-Small token of the trip.
-Mmm.

59:02.539 --> 59:04.750
You know, John Wayne Gacy
used to give those out to kids

59:04.792 --> 59:05.793
when he was a birthday clown.

59:05.834 --> 59:08.087
Whatever, I still love them.

59:08.128 --> 59:10.673
Thanks for letting me come.

59:10.714 --> 59:12.299
It was fun

59:12.341 --> 59:16.387
-until it got so horrible.
-Yeah.

59:16.428 --> 59:19.348
-What can I say?
It's my specialty.
-(chuckles)

59:20.391 --> 59:22.768
Well, um,

59:22.810 --> 59:26.355
listen, if you're ever in
the mood for another Almond Joy,

59:26.397 --> 59:28.565
just-just shoot me a text.
(chuckles)

59:28.607 --> 59:30.192
That came out so gross.
I'm sorry.

59:30.234 --> 59:32.236
Hughie.

59:33.612 --> 59:35.572
we can't do that again.

59:35.614 --> 59:39.576
No, no, no, no. No, we can't.

59:39.618 --> 59:40.995
Why, though?

59:41.036 --> 59:44.373
I mean, th... this is...
this is good.

59:44.415 --> 59:46.250
But that's just it.

59:46.292 --> 59:51.130
I mean, we can't afford
to feel good or to feel safe

59:51.171 --> 59:53.257
or to let our guard down.

59:53.299 --> 59:55.134
You can't go through this
on your own.

59:57.011 --> 59:59.013
We're all alone.

1:00:00.139 --> 1:00:02.850
That's the truth.

1:00:02.891 --> 1:00:05.311
But it doesn't have
to be like that.

1:00:13.444 --> 1:00:15.446
Goodbye, Hughie.

1:00:34.631 --> 1:00:38.510
I believe the secret
to a great relationship

1:00:38.552 --> 1:00:41.430
is to be willing...

1:00:41.472 --> 1:00:44.350
to do anything for your man.

1:00:44.391 --> 1:00:46.810
Anything.

1:00:46.852 --> 1:00:48.479
I'm a feminist,

1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:52.649
but I'm also very sexual,

1:00:52.691 --> 1:00:55.819
and I don't see that
as contradictory.

1:00:55.861 --> 1:00:59.948
What's wrong
with giving pleasure

1:00:59.990 --> 1:01:01.992
and receiving it?

1:01:02.034 --> 1:01:05.329
Thank you for coming in, Gianna.

1:01:05.371 --> 1:01:08.207
Yeah, we appreciate your candor.

1:01:08.248 --> 1:01:10.000
DEEP:
Thank you so much.

1:01:10.042 --> 1:01:12.419
Anytime. It was really great
meeting you.

1:01:12.461 --> 1:01:13.670
Really great.

1:01:13.712 --> 1:01:15.839
So great.

1:01:20.427 --> 1:01:23.555
Bye.

1:01:23.597 --> 1:01:26.642
(chuckles) Her. Gianna.
I choose her.

1:01:26.683 --> 1:01:28.936
I mean, she's the one,
no question.

1:01:28.977 --> 1:01:30.979
CAROL:
No, she isn't.

1:01:31.021 --> 1:01:32.189
Wait, what?

1:01:32.231 --> 1:01:34.274
She was, like,
hands down the winner.

1:01:34.316 --> 1:01:35.943
It was not even a contest.

1:01:35.984 --> 1:01:37.861
It's Cassandra.

1:01:37.903 --> 1:01:40.989
Cassandra? The one...
the one with the hair

1:01:41.031 --> 1:01:42.950
and the creepy skeletons
hugging each other story?

1:01:42.991 --> 1:01:44.201
Yes.

1:01:44.243 --> 1:01:45.577
That's your wife.

1:01:45.619 --> 1:01:49.123
Oh... But...

1:01:49.164 --> 1:01:51.125
but I thought I got to choose.

1:01:51.166 --> 1:01:54.378
You do, and you're
choosing Cassandra.

1:01:54.420 --> 1:01:56.171
Congratulations.

1:01:56.213 --> 1:01:59.675
Yeah, but, I mean, Gianna...

1:01:59.716 --> 1:02:03.720
Is lovely. She's lovely. She's a
valued member of The Collective,

1:02:03.762 --> 1:02:05.514
but this marriage isn't about

1:02:05.556 --> 1:02:08.016
satisfying your base desires.

1:02:08.058 --> 1:02:10.561
It's about rehabilitating
your image

1:02:10.602 --> 1:02:12.688
and getting you back
in The Seven.

1:02:12.729 --> 1:02:15.315
That is what you want, isn't it?

1:02:34.918 --> 1:02:37.129
There you are.

1:02:43.594 --> 1:02:46.013
I was beginning to worry.

1:02:54.897 --> 1:02:57.107
Oh, I missed you.

1:03:01.653 --> 1:03:03.864
Are you thirsty?

1:03:05.991 --> 1:03:07.409
Want some?

1:03:10.245 --> 1:03:13.457
Aw, I want you so bad.

1:03:20.339 --> 1:03:22.841
Are you okay?

1:03:22.883 --> 1:03:25.344
Would you like me
to be someone else?

1:03:25.385 --> 1:03:28.222
I can be whoever you want.

1:03:28.263 --> 1:03:29.640
(gasps)

1:03:35.646 --> 1:03:37.814
No.

1:03:39.858 --> 1:03:41.860
I don't need anyone...

1:03:44.029 --> 1:03:46.031
...but myself.

1:04:01.129 --> 1:04:04.466
Like what you see?

1:04:04.508 --> 1:04:07.511
See how hot you are?

1:04:08.762 --> 1:04:10.347
Hmm?

1:04:12.349 --> 1:04:14.768
Come on.

1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:18.814
How much do you want this?

1:04:20.857 --> 1:04:22.859
How much?

1:04:31.159 --> 1:04:34.246
I'm gonna suck your cock
so fucking hard,

1:04:34.288 --> 1:04:37.082
so good,

1:04:37.124 --> 1:04:40.502
and you're gonna look
in your own eyes when you come.

1:04:42.004 --> 1:04:44.464
It's not even gay

1:04:44.506 --> 1:04:47.384
if it's with yourself, right?

1:04:48.844 --> 1:04:51.972
(chuckles)
Oh,

1:04:52.014 --> 1:04:54.891
you're so special,

1:04:54.933 --> 1:04:58.020
the most special man

1:04:58.061 --> 1:05:00.355
on the planet.

1:05:00.397 --> 1:05:04.359
Everybody loves you.

1:05:04.401 --> 1:05:07.237
Everybody.

1:05:07.279 --> 1:05:09.906
Their love

1:05:09.948 --> 1:05:13.285
is your strength.

1:05:24.087 --> 1:05:27.007
You're pathetic.

1:05:39.686 --> 1:05:42.230
I don't need everyone
to love me.

1:05:43.899 --> 1:05:45.734
I don't need anyone.

1:05:50.656 --> 1:05:52.783
I don't

1:05:52.824 --> 1:05:55.869
need you!

1:05:55.911 --> 1:05:57.329
(neck snaps)

1:05:57.371 --> 1:06:00.248
(body thuds)

1:06:09.383 --> 1:06:10.967
(fire crackling)
