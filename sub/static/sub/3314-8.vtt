WEBVTT

00:07.088 --> 00:09.008
- HEY.
- HEY.

00:09.009 --> 00:11.431
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN COMPLAINING
THAT YOU CAN'T GET TO YOUR CLOTHES

00:11.432 --> 00:13.513
IN THE CLOSET, SO I WEEDED OUT
ALL THE STUFF WE DON'T NEED.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.894
OH, GREAT.

00:14.895 --> 00:17.557
HEY, THESE ARE ALL MY THINGS.

00:17.558 --> 00:20.770
YEAH, BUT IT'S JUST
RECORDS, BOOKS, TROPHIES,

00:20.771 --> 00:23.022
FAMILY PHOTOS. YOU KNOW,
JUNK YOU DON'T NEED.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.315
WHY IS ALL MY STUFF JUNK?

00:25.316 --> 00:28.948
MAYBE THAT'S A QUESTION
YOU NEED TO ASK YOURSELF.

00:28.949 --> 00:32.362
WHOA, HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. I'M NOT
GETTING RID OF MY C.D.s, GIRL.

00:32.363 --> 00:34.154
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE INTERNET?

00:34.155 --> 00:35.955
YOU KNOW, I HEAR IT'S
REALLY CATCHING ON.

00:35.956 --> 00:39.419
I'M SURE YOU CAN DOWNLOAD
BELL BIV DeVOE, ROCKWELL,

00:39.420 --> 00:42.001
JOE AND JOE... WAIT A
MINUTE, IS THAT GUY YOU?!

00:42.002 --> 00:43.463
WHAT?

00:43.464 --> 00:45.835
HUH? HOW ABOUT THAT?
IT IS, YEAH.

00:45.836 --> 00:48.258
STOP, STOP, STOP! OH, WE ARE
SO GONNA CHECK THIS OUT.

00:48.259 --> 00:49.879
NO. NO, WE'RE NOT.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.092
YEAH, "JOE DUKE AND
JOE LONGFELLOW"?

00:52.093 --> 00:54.844
LONGFELLOW? WAS THAT
YOUR PORN-STAR NAME?

00:54.845 --> 00:57.517
OKAY, AFTER COLLEGE, I HAD
A BRIEF MUSIC CAREER.

00:57.518 --> 00:59.309
ALL RIGHT? THEN I GOT SERIOUS,
I WENT TO BUSINESS SCHOOL...

00:59.310 --> 01:00.890
THE BEST DECISION
THAT I EVER MADE.

01:00.891 --> 01:02.682
HOW COME YOU NEVER
TOLD ME YOU DID MUSIC?

01:02.683 --> 01:04.604
BECAUSE IT WAS SHORT-LIVED,
AND NOW IT'S LIVING

01:04.605 --> 01:06.686
AT THE BOTTOM OF A BOX, SO GAME OVER.
CAN I HAVE IT, PLEASE?

01:06.687 --> 01:08.067
NO, WAIT, WAIT.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.740
SHOULD WE LISTEN TO
THE DEPTH OF YOU

01:10.741 --> 01:12.362
OR EVERYTHING I WANT IS YOU?

01:12.363 --> 01:14.614
OR BETTER YET, YOU AND YOU?

01:14.615 --> 01:16.746
CAN I HAVE IT, PLEASE?

01:16.747 --> 01:20.660
RIGHT AFTER YOU
WHISPER ME TO HEAVEN.

01:20.661 --> 01:23.253
ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
I WON'T TEASE YOU ANYMORE.

01:23.254 --> 01:26.877

01:49.109 --> 01:51.070
HEY, GUYS, GUESS WHAT I
JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT JOE?

01:51.071 --> 01:52.902
HE WAS A SINGER IN A BOY BAND.

01:52.903 --> 01:54.324
AND HE WAS ADORABLE. LOOK!

01:54.325 --> 01:56.736
- (all laughing)
- WHAT IS THAT THING?

01:56.737 --> 02:00.830
OH, IT'S A C.D. IT'S HOW OLD
PEOPLE USED TO LISTEN TO MUSIC.

02:00.831 --> 02:02.952
I KNOW WHAT A C.D. IS.

02:02.953 --> 02:05.295
HEY, IF IT'S COOL ENOUGH
TO WEAR A FLANNEL SHIRT,

02:05.296 --> 02:07.747
WHY DID YOU CUT OFF THE SLEEVES?

02:07.748 --> 02:09.549
YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU? A
LUMBERJACK IN HAWAII?

02:09.550 --> 02:13.343
GUYS, STOP MAKING FUN OF JOE.
OH MY GOSH! I CAN'T EVEN!

02:13.344 --> 02:15.465
(all laughing)

02:15.466 --> 02:16.886
OKAY, LAUGH IT UP, LADIES.
LAUGH IT UP, YEAH.

02:16.887 --> 02:18.808
WE ALL KNOW NOW I HAD A
BRIEF SINGING CAREER.

02:18.809 --> 02:20.640
ALL RIGHT? BUT THE
SINGING IS NOW OVER,

02:20.641 --> 02:22.312
SO ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE.
DANI, IT'S YOUR TURN.

02:22.313 --> 02:23.813
TELL US SOMETHING WE
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

02:23.814 --> 02:24.974
I'M A SINGER TOO.

02:24.975 --> 02:26.646
- OKAY, LISTEN UP, PEOPLE...
- REALLY?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.938
THAT'S SO INTERESTING, BECAUSE
I HEAR YOUR DAD WAS A SINGER.

02:28.939 --> 02:30.980
YEAH, I USED TO SING ALL THE
TIME BACK IN FORT WAYNE.

02:30.981 --> 02:32.612
WE HAD A PIANO.

02:32.613 --> 02:33.773
I WONDER IF DANI'S VOICE SOUNDS

02:33.774 --> 02:35.114
ANYTHING LIKE JOE'S VOICE.

02:35.115 --> 02:37.907
YOU KNOW, IF ONLY THERE WERE
A WAY TO HEAR BOTH VOICES

02:37.908 --> 02:40.330
AND COMPARE THEM. HMM.

02:40.331 --> 02:41.621
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO STOP, ARE YOU,

02:41.622 --> 02:43.203
TILL YOU HEAR SOME NOISE
COMING OUT OF THAT THING?

02:43.204 --> 02:44.994
ALL RIGHT, HAND IT OVER.
HAND IT OVER.

02:44.995 --> 02:46.337
- (disc snaps)
- THERE WE GO.

02:47.378 --> 02:49.880
LOOK AT THAT... IT
MADE SOME NOISE!

02:51.252 --> 02:54.093
(rapping at door)

02:54.094 --> 02:56.556
LENNOX! LENNOX, THIS
IS UNBELIEVABLE NEWS.

02:56.557 --> 02:57.797
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
WHAT HAPPENED.

02:57.798 --> 03:01.010
SOMEONE'S HAD WAY TOO
MANY ENERGY DRINKS?

03:01.011 --> 03:02.932
WELL, YEAH.

03:02.933 --> 03:06.646
AND IVANA ROBICHEK
LOVES OUR WEB SERIES.

03:06.647 --> 03:08.938
- (gasps) NO WAY!
- UH-HUH.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.650
WHO'S IVANA ROBICHEK?

03:10.651 --> 03:12.772
THIS GO-GETTER GRAD STUDENT
FROM THE FILM-PRODUCING PROGRAM

03:12.773 --> 03:14.113
AND SHE WANTS TO
TURN "CASSANDRA"

03:14.114 --> 03:15.815
INTO A LIVE-ACTION SHORT FILM.

03:15.816 --> 03:18.908
WAIT, DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY
IT COSTS TO MAKE A STUDENT FILM?

03:18.909 --> 03:20.740
IVANA'S GONNA PAY FOR
THE WHOLE THING.

03:20.741 --> 03:23.414
I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THAT GIRL.

03:24.585 --> 03:26.246
CAN I COME IN?

03:26.247 --> 03:28.828
OH, I THOUGHT YOUR INSANELY
POSSESSIVE GIRLFRIEND LILAH

03:28.829 --> 03:30.880
BANNED YOU FROM EVER
SEEING ME AGAIN.

03:30.881 --> 03:32.542
(laughs) NO, NO, NO!

03:32.543 --> 03:33.883
THAT'S SO NOT A PROBLEM ANYMORE.

03:33.884 --> 03:36.886
LENNOX, THIS FILM COULD BE AN
AWESOME OPPORTUNITY FOR US.

03:36.887 --> 03:38.428
ARE YOU IN?

03:38.429 --> 03:41.220
IF YOU'RE SURE LILAH IS NOT
GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.723
ABSOLUTELY NOT. JUST ONE...
ONE LITTLE THING.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.805
UH, IF YOU NEED TO REACH
ME, CALL ME ON THIS PHONE,

03:45.806 --> 03:47.016
NOT MY REGULAR CELL.

03:47.017 --> 03:49.939
AND IF I ANSWER AND I SAY,

03:49.940 --> 03:53.022
"HOLA, PEDRO," IT MEANS I'LL CALL
YOU BACK IN, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES.

03:53.023 --> 03:55.275
YOU BOUGHT A PHONE JUST FOR ME?

03:55.276 --> 03:56.816
THAT'S SWEET, ISN'T IT?

03:56.817 --> 03:59.028
SWEET? NO! IT'S A BURNER.

03:59.029 --> 04:02.622
YOU BOUGHT THIS CHEAP PHONE SO YOU
COULD KEEP US SECRET FROM LILAH.

04:02.623 --> 04:04.825
YEAH, BUT IT'LL BE FUN.
IT'S LIKE WE'RE SPIES.

04:05.956 --> 04:08.458
COME BACK AFTER YOU TELL LILAH

04:08.459 --> 04:10.500
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.372
I KNOW, BUT I CAN'T
TELL HER TONIGHT.

04:12.373 --> 04:13.673
WHY NOT?

04:13.674 --> 04:15.675
WELL, TONIGHT'S
SUPER-HERO SEX NIGHT.

04:15.676 --> 04:18.678
SHE DRESSES UP LIKE MYSTIQUE, SO SHE
WEARS NOTHING BUT BLUE EYE SHADOW

04:18.679 --> 04:20.931
- ALL OVER THAT PERFECT LITTLE BODY.
- MY FAULT FOR ASKING.

04:24.935 --> 04:27.557
ISN'T SHE A BEAUTY? I GOT
IT ONLINE FROM A GUY

04:27.558 --> 04:29.849
FOR 50 BUCKS BECAUSE THERE
WAS A DEAD CAT IN IT.

04:29.850 --> 04:32.392
(sprays)

04:32.393 --> 04:34.894
BUT IT'S ALL GOOD NOW.

04:34.895 --> 04:37.317
- AND THIS IS FOR ME?
- AND ME!

04:37.318 --> 04:39.529
YOU KNOW, IF I EVER DECIDE
TO DRAPE MYSELF ACROSS IT

04:39.530 --> 04:41.781
AND SING A TORCH
SONG TO A GANGSTER.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.664
COME ON, TRY IT OUT.

04:47.368 --> 04:49.208
(playing)

04:49.209 --> 04:50.790
WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO PLAY?

04:50.791 --> 04:54.214

AWESOME TEACHER, MR. YOUTUBE.

I WAS GOING TO SAY SIMON
COWELL, BUT YOURS IS BETTER.

05:43.384 --> 05:45.224
JOE, DANI'S SONG WAS GREAT,

05:45.225 --> 05:47.677
AND ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY
IS, "EH, NOT BAD"?

05:47.678 --> 05:49.809
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE
ENCOURAGING TO YOUR DAUGHTER.

05:49.810 --> 05:52.271
MAYBE BEING ENCOURAGING ISN'T
REALLY THE BEST THING FOR HER.

05:52.272 --> 05:55.144
OH, WAIT, SO IT'S A PARENT'S JOB

05:55.145 --> 05:56.896
TO CRUSH THEIR
CHILDREN'S DREAMS.

05:56.897 --> 05:59.899
WAIT A SECOND, I'VE GOT TO
CALL MY MOM AND THANK HER!

05:59.900 --> 06:02.151
I'M JUST SAYING THERE'S
A MIDDLE GROUND,

06:02.152 --> 06:04.574
YOU KNOW, BETWEEN CRUSHING THEIR
DREAMS AND BUILDING FALSE HOPE.

06:04.575 --> 06:06.866
I MEAN, NOWADAYS, THE MESSAGE IS,
YOU KNOW, "FOLLOW YOUR HEART,

06:06.867 --> 06:08.538
"FOLLOW YOUR HEART."
WELL, YOU KNOW,

06:08.539 --> 06:10.039
MAYBE THAT'S NOT THE
BEST THING TO DO,

06:10.040 --> 06:11.951
'CAUSE IF YOU FOLLOW YOUR
HEART, IT CAN LEAD YOU

06:11.952 --> 06:13.913
RIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC.
YOU KNOW WHY?

06:13.914 --> 06:15.915
YOUR HEART DOESN'T
HAVE ANY EYES.

06:15.916 --> 06:18.047
DOES THIS HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH YOU

06:18.048 --> 06:20.880
AND THE BEST DECISION YOU EVER
MADE, GETTING OUT OF MUSIC?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.673
THE BEST DECISION I EVER MADE,
HONEY, WAS MARRYING YOU.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.264
WELL, I KNOW,

06:25.265 --> 06:27.887
BUT STOP TRYING TO
CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.890
WHERE IS ALL THIS NEGATIVE
ATTITUDE COMING FROM?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.892
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME.

06:32.893 --> 06:36.015
DID YOU CHANGE YOUR HAIR?
IT LOOKS AMAZING.

06:36.016 --> 06:38.107
I KNOW,

06:38.108 --> 06:40.650
BUT STOP TRYING TO DISTRACT
ME WITH THE TRUTH.

06:40.651 --> 06:44.193
DANI'S JUST A KID HAVING FUN.

06:44.194 --> 06:46.486
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
BE ENCOURAGING.

06:46.487 --> 06:49.028
ARE YOU JUST GOING TO IGNORE
HER EVERY TIME SHE PLAYS?

06:49.029 --> 06:51.160
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.743
FROM NOW ON...

06:54.294 --> 06:56.706
(flatly) I'M HER BIGGEST FAN.

06:56.707 --> 06:58.247
OH, DON'T OVERDO IT.

06:58.248 --> 06:59.839
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE THAT BUBBLY,

06:59.840 --> 07:01.962
SHE MIGHT THINK
YOU'RE FAKING IT.

07:05.966 --> 07:07.967
- HEY, LEN.
- AH-AH-AH-AH! NOT SO FAST.

07:07.968 --> 07:10.720
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED IN UNTIL
I KNOW YOU'VE TOLD LILAH.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.602
THAT'S ALL TAKEN CARE OF.
(whistles)

07:12.603 --> 07:16.265
OH. WAIT, SO YOU TOLD HER
WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER,

07:16.266 --> 07:17.817
AND SHE'S OKAY WITH IT?

07:17.818 --> 07:20.690
WOW. I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.692
- (cell phone ringing)
- YOU THINK I'M SCARED OF HER?

07:22.693 --> 07:25.274
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, WHAT KIND OF
MAN IS SCARED OF HIS GIRLFRIEND?

07:25.275 --> 07:28.067
OH MY GOD, IT'S LILAH!
SHE'S FACE-TIMING ME.

07:28.068 --> 07:30.990
(gasps) YOU STILL
HAVEN'T TOLD HER!

07:30.991 --> 07:33.032
I WAS THIS CLOSE. OH, SHE
CAN'T KNOW I'M HERE.

07:33.033 --> 07:36.165
UH, NEUTRAL WALL! NEUTRAL WALL.

07:36.166 --> 07:38.127
HI, HON.

07:38.128 --> 07:39.709
WHERE AM I?

07:39.710 --> 07:43.883
I'M AT THAT, YOU KNOW,
SWEDISH FURNITURE STORE...

07:43.884 --> 07:45.845
IN THE DOOR SECTION. YEAH.

07:45.846 --> 07:48.718
THIS ONE'S CALLED HAAGENDORF.

07:48.719 --> 07:51.851
ONLY $11. (chuckles)

07:51.852 --> 07:53.973
I DON'T KNOW HOW
THEY DO IT EITHER.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.556
PICK YOU UP ONE?

07:56.557 --> 07:58.938
SURE.

07:58.939 --> 08:01.732
OKAY. OH YEAH. TALK TO YOU LATER.
KISS KISS. MWAH!

08:03.604 --> 08:04.984
YOU LIED TO ME!

08:04.985 --> 08:06.866
YEAH, BUT ONLY ABOUT
THE LILAH STUFF.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.908
THAT'S ALL THE STUFF.

08:08.909 --> 08:10.820
I WANTED TO TELL HER.

08:10.821 --> 08:12.992
I JUST DON'T SEE WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING OUT OF THIS RELATIONSHIP

08:12.993 --> 08:15.494
THAT'S WORTH SACRIFICING
YOUR DIGNITY.

08:15.495 --> 08:19.919
SEX. KILLER, KILLER SEX.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.001
IF A GUY IS SACRIFICING
HIS DIGNITY,

08:22.002 --> 08:25.464
ASSUME HE'S DOING IT FOR SEX.

08:25.465 --> 08:28.007
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO TELL
HER ABOUT US, ARE YOU?

08:28.008 --> 08:30.049
WELL, SHE'LL DUMP ME, AND
I CAN'T DO THAT TONIGHT

08:30.050 --> 08:32.932
BECAUSE IT'S COWBOY NIGHT.

08:32.933 --> 08:35.845
- SHE'S GONNA LASSO ME UP...
- AH! STOP!

08:35.846 --> 08:39.478
OKAY, I DO NOT NEED TO KNOW
THE THEME OF EVERY NIGHT.

08:39.479 --> 08:41.901
YOU KNOW WHAT, ZANDER?
FORGET IT.

08:41.902 --> 08:43.643
- WE CAN'T WORK TOGETHER.
- WHOA.

08:43.644 --> 08:45.855
BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR FILM?

08:45.856 --> 08:47.857
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

08:47.858 --> 08:50.239
WELL, COULD I USE
YOUR SCREWDRIVER?

08:50.240 --> 08:52.612
I NEED TO BORROW YOUR
DOOR FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

08:52.613 --> 08:54.704
BYE, ZANDER.

08:54.705 --> 08:56.576
I'LL BRING IT RIGHT BACK.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.287
YOU KNOW, LILAH
RETURNS EVERYTHING.

08:58.288 --> 09:00.871
I'M CLOSING THE HAAGENDORF.

09:02.873 --> 09:05.045

09:09.429 --> 09:12.381
HEY. OH, DON'T MIND ME.

09:12.382 --> 09:15.174
DO YOUR THING. THAT
SOUNDED GREAT.

09:15.175 --> 09:17.887
YESTERDAY IT SEEMED LIKE YOU
DIDN'T LIKE MY PLAYING.

09:17.888 --> 09:20.890
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT IDEA?

09:20.891 --> 09:24.895
UH, YOU RAN OUT OF THE ROOM.

09:25.896 --> 09:27.987
I DID NOT RUN OUT OF HERE.

09:27.988 --> 09:31.320
I WALKED AT A CASUAL PACE.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.494
I WANT TO HEAR YOU,
SO PLEASE CONTINUE.

MAYBE YOU COULD JOIN ME?

10:16.326 --> 10:20.539
NO, NO, NO, I HAVEN'T... I
HAVEN'T SUNG IN A LONG TIME.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.621
IT'S LIKE RIDING A BIKE...

10:22.622 --> 10:24.293
WITH YOUR MOUTH.

10:24.294 --> 10:26.245
COME ON.

10:26.246 --> 10:27.506
I DON'T THINK SO.

10:27.507 --> 10:29.959
WHY NOT? WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.461
YEAH, SURE, IT ALWAYS STARTS OUT
THAT WAY, BUT MUSIC IS NOT FUN.

10:32.462 --> 10:35.805
MUSIC IS... NEVER MIND.

10:35.806 --> 10:39.388
ARE YOU KIDDING? MUSIC
IS NOTHING BUT FUN.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.220
EXCEPT WHEN IT
BREAKS YOUR HEART,

10:41.221 --> 10:43.432
AND THAT'S ALL I'M
GOING TO SAY ABOUT IT.

10:43.433 --> 10:45.394
EXCEPT THAT MUSIC
IS A WITCH, OKAY?

10:45.395 --> 10:47.937
MAKES YOU A BUNCH
OF FALSE PROMISES

10:47.938 --> 10:50.399
AND THEN IT LEAVES
YOU WITH NOTHING.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.862
I MET A LOT OF MUSICIANS
THROUGH MY MOM,

10:52.863 --> 10:54.904
AND THEIR LIVES ALL
SEEM PRETTY GREAT.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.946
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU AND
YOUR MOM ONLY HANG OUT

10:56.947 --> 10:58.367
WITH MUSICIANS WHO HAVE MADE IT.

10:58.368 --> 11:01.240
YOU DON'T SEE THE MILLIONS OF
ONES OUT THERE THAT STARVE.

11:01.241 --> 11:04.583
OH, SO I'M NOT GOOD
ENOUGH TO MAKE IT.

11:04.584 --> 11:05.955
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

11:05.956 --> 11:07.957
NO, I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.249
MATH IS SAYING THAT.

11:10.250 --> 11:12.752
MATH?

11:12.753 --> 11:14.423
HONEY, YOU COULD BE THE MOST
TALENTED PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD,

11:14.424 --> 11:16.005
THE ODDS ARE STACKED
UP AGAINST YOU.

11:16.006 --> 11:18.718
AND YOU DON'T THINK I'M BALLSY
ENOUGH TO TOUGH IT OUT.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.219
I THINK YOU'RE PLENTY...

11:20.220 --> 11:22.351
THAT WORD I WILL NEVER, EVER
SAY TO MY DAUGHTER, ALL RIGHT?

11:22.352 --> 11:23.853
BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
EITHER, HONEY,

11:23.854 --> 11:25.805
'CAUSE IT COMES DOWN TO THINGS
THAT ARE OUT OF YOUR CONTROL,

11:25.806 --> 11:28.437
LIKE... YOU KNOW, LIKE LUCK,
AND THE WAY YOU SOUND,

11:28.438 --> 11:30.439
AND, YOU KNOW, HAVING
THE RIGHT LOOK.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.571
OH, SO NOW I'M NOT PRETTY!

11:32.572 --> 11:33.903
I DIDN'T SAY THAT!

11:33.904 --> 11:35.574
LOOK, I'M TRYING TO
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

11:35.575 --> 11:37.777
HASHTAG GREAT JOB!

11:37.778 --> 11:39.318
DANI? DANI, WAIT A MINUTE.

11:39.319 --> 11:40.740
SWEETIE, COME HERE.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.161
- LET HER GO.
- HEY.

11:42.162 --> 11:43.582
SHE COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTOOD ME.

11:43.583 --> 11:44.784
OKAY, WELL, LET'S BREAK IT DOWN.

11:44.785 --> 11:46.786
OKAY, YOU CAME IN HERE TO
BE THE SUPPORTIVE DAD,

11:46.787 --> 11:48.918
AND THEN YOU TOLD HER SHE
SUCKS AND SHE'S UGLY.

11:48.919 --> 11:51.170
WHERE DID THAT PLAN GO WRONG?

11:51.171 --> 11:52.922
SHE TWISTED MY WORDS, ALL RIGHT?

11:52.923 --> 11:54.884
EVERYTHING I JUST TOLD
HER IS 100% TRUE.

11:54.885 --> 11:56.886
JOE, YOU'RE DEALING
WITH A 13-YEAR-OLD.

11:56.887 --> 11:58.758
YOU'RE HER FATHER. YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO TELL HER

11:58.759 --> 12:00.339
SHE'S THE MOST WONDERFUL
THING IN THE WORLD.

12:00.340 --> 12:03.342
THEN JUST SHUT UP.

12:03.343 --> 12:06.145
- I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT HER.
- FROM WHAT?

12:06.146 --> 12:08.347
FROM PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE
GOING TO HURT HER FEELINGS.

12:08.348 --> 12:11.270
AND YOU DON'T SEE THE IRONY
IN WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

12:11.271 --> 12:14.693
LOOK, JOE, THINGS ARE
GOING TO KEEP GOING WRONG

12:14.694 --> 12:17.526
UNTIL YOU FACE WHATEVER MUSICAL
DEMONS ARE IN YOUR PAST.

12:17.527 --> 12:19.448
I DON'T HAVE ANY MUSICAL
DEMONS IN MY PAST.

12:19.449 --> 12:20.860
YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM YOUR DEMONS.

12:20.861 --> 12:22.281
MAYBE NOT, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:22.282 --> 12:23.824
I CAN HIDE FROM YOU.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.538
- JOE?
- MEL, LOOK, BEFORE YOU START,

12:29.539 --> 12:32.131
I SWEAR TO YOU, THERE IS NO
DEEP, DARK MUSICAL SECRET.

12:32.132 --> 12:33.712
I'VE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT THAT.

12:33.713 --> 12:36.876
I FOUND THE SEXIEST VIDEO.
DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

LITTLE EMBARRASSING.

13:07.537 --> 13:09.168
WHAT PART WAS EMBARRASSING?

13:09.169 --> 13:11.330
THAT VIDEO WAS AWESOME.

13:11.331 --> 13:14.333
YES, AWESOME. THAT'S THE
WORD I WAS GONNA USE.

13:14.334 --> 13:16.175
YOU KNOW, I BET YOU GUYS
COULD HAVE MADE IT.

13:16.176 --> 13:17.837
YOU'RE NOT HELPING, MEL.

13:17.838 --> 13:18.969

13:20.470 --> 13:22.011
I'M SORRY, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

13:22.012 --> 13:25.304
I JUST DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT
THE "WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEENs."

13:25.305 --> 13:27.016
ALL RIGHT, JOE.

13:27.017 --> 13:30.059
SPILL IT. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
WENT ON "BEHIND THE MUSIC."

13:30.060 --> 13:32.893
ALL RIGHT.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.815
SO RIGHT AFTER WE
SHOT THAT VIDEO,

13:36.816 --> 13:38.988
JOE AND JOE ACTUALLY
STARTED TO TAKE OFF.

13:38.989 --> 13:42.321
WOMEN ACTUALLY STARTED THROWING
THEIR UNDERWEAR AT US.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.613
SOME GUYS DID, TOO.

13:44.614 --> 13:46.655
WE HAD A REAL CROSSOVER APPEAL.

13:46.656 --> 13:48.707
ANYWAY, WE ENDED UP SIGNING
WITH THIS BIG PROMOTER

13:48.708 --> 13:50.289
AND THERE WAS NO MONEY
IN IT AT FIRST,

13:50.290 --> 13:51.911
BUT HE WAS GOING TO BOOK US
ON OUR FIRST NATIONAL TOUR.

13:51.912 --> 13:53.953
AND THAT SAME WEEK,

13:53.954 --> 13:55.834
I GOT ACCEPTED TO
BUSINESS SCHOOL.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.007
SO HERE WAS... HERE
WAS MY CHOICE.

13:58.008 --> 14:00.459
A LIFE ON THE ROAD,

14:00.460 --> 14:03.052
PLAYING BARS WITH NO GUARANTEE
OF EVER MAKING IT BIG TIME,

14:03.053 --> 14:06.385
OR A COLUMBIA M.B.A.
ON SCHOLARSHIP.

14:06.386 --> 14:08.307
YOU MADE THE SMART CHOICE.

14:08.308 --> 14:09.808
WHY IS THIS SUCH A BIG DEAL?

14:09.809 --> 14:11.640
BECAUSE I QUIT.

14:11.641 --> 14:13.973
ALL RIGHT? I NEVER
TOLD YOU ABOUT IT,

14:13.974 --> 14:16.025
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO THINK I WAS A QUITTER.

14:16.026 --> 14:17.566
SO THERE IT IS.

14:17.567 --> 14:20.819
THERE'S MY BIG DARK
MUSICAL SECRET.

14:20.820 --> 14:22.191
BUT YOU'RE NOT A QUITTER.

14:22.192 --> 14:24.693
YOU KNOW, AND JUST BECAUSE
YOU CHOSE BUSINESS

14:24.694 --> 14:27.786
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO ERASE
MUSIC FROM YOUR LIFE COMPLETELY.

14:27.787 --> 14:29.408
I SAW THAT VIDEO.

14:29.409 --> 14:31.991
I'M NOT SURPRISED YOU GUYS CAUGHT
A FEW PANTIES IN YOUR DAY.

14:31.992 --> 14:35.164
TO BE HONEST, MOST OF
THEM WERE AIMED AT ME.

14:35.165 --> 14:38.457
OKAY, SO MAYBE YOU DON'T MENTION
THE WHOLE PANTY THING TO DANI,

14:38.458 --> 14:40.669
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE IF
YOU COULD SING WITH HER,

14:40.670 --> 14:42.631
SHARE THAT PART OF YOUR LIFE.

14:42.632 --> 14:44.633
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.056
I'VE SEEN THE DREAMS OF A LOT OF
VERY TALENTED PEOPLE CRASH AND BURN.

14:47.057 --> 14:50.009
ALL RIGHT? AND IF I SING WITH
DANI, IT COULD SOUND SO GOOD THAT

14:50.010 --> 14:52.011
THAT COULD BE THE THING
THAT INSPIRES HER

14:52.012 --> 14:53.602
TO PURSUE THIS
CRAZY MUSIC DREAM.

14:53.603 --> 14:55.274
13-YEAR-OLDS ARE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE CRAZY DREAMS.

14:55.275 --> 14:57.977
WHEN I WAS THAT AGE, I WANTED TO BE
A FLY GIRL ON "IN LIVING COLOR."

14:57.978 --> 14:59.608
(snorts)

14:59.609 --> 15:01.690
- DID YOU JUST LAUGH?
- WHAT? NO, THAT WAS A COUGH.

15:01.691 --> 15:03.782
(coughs) IT'S IN MY
THROAT I COUGHED.

15:03.783 --> 15:06.235
LOOK, MUSIC IS NOT
KRYPTONITE, OKAY?

15:06.236 --> 15:09.329
SO GO SING WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.
OH, AND BY THE WAY...

15:13.623 --> 15:14.954
WHOO! YEAH!

15:14.955 --> 15:17.797
THEY BRING THAT SHOW
BACK, I AM SO HIRED.

15:21.881 --> 15:24.424
(doorbell rings)

15:26.216 --> 15:28.807
(cell phone ringing)

15:28.808 --> 15:31.550
OH, UH, HELLO?

15:31.551 --> 15:33.932
I KNEW THIS WAS
YOUR PHONE NUMBER!

15:33.933 --> 15:36.315
LILAH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:36.316 --> 15:37.896
I FOUND THIS IN
ZANDER'S MESSENGER BAG.

15:37.897 --> 15:40.559
AND IT'S ONLY CALLED ONE
NUMBER, REPEATEDLY... YOURS.

15:40.560 --> 15:43.362
I KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS. ONLY TWO TYPES
OF PEOPLE HAVE PHONES LIKE THIS...

15:43.363 --> 15:45.364
DRUG DEALERS AND
CHEATING BOYFRIENDS.

15:45.365 --> 15:47.907
LENNOX, I HAVE YOUR
ILLEGAL DRUGS!

15:49.779 --> 15:52.371
WOULD YOU LIKE A PAPER RECEIPT
OR SHALL I EMAIL IT TO YOU?

15:52.372 --> 15:55.074
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, ZANDER.

15:55.075 --> 15:56.495
YOU'VE BEEN SNEAKING AROUND.

15:56.496 --> 15:58.837
(grunts)

15:58.838 --> 16:01.080
YOU EVEN BOUGHT HER THE
HAAGENDORF I LIKED.

16:01.081 --> 16:04.343
LOOK, LILAH, I SWEAR, WE'RE
NOT DOING ANYTHING WRONG.

16:04.344 --> 16:07.006
LENNOX AND I ARE WORKING ON A SHORT FILM.
IT'S STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL.

16:07.007 --> 16:09.468
IF NOTHING'S GOING ON, WHEN WHY
DID YOU KEEP THIS FROM ME?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.010
BECAUSE YOU WON'T ACCEPT
MY FRIENDSHIP WITH LENNOX.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.802
OH, LOOK, LILAH,

16:13.803 --> 16:16.185
I REALLY, REALLY
LIKE BEING WITH YOU,

16:16.186 --> 16:17.896
BUT IF YOU CAN'T GET PAST THIS,

16:17.897 --> 16:20.099
THEN I'M AFRAID YOU
AND I ARE OVER.

16:20.100 --> 16:23.862
YOU DO REALIZE THAT MY
ROOMMATE'S OUT OF TOWN TONIGHT,

16:23.863 --> 16:26.275
WHICH MEANS THAT THERE'S
NO NOISE LIMITATIONS,

16:26.276 --> 16:27.907
AND IT'S CIRCUS NIGHT.

16:30.950 --> 16:32.781
OH?

16:32.782 --> 16:36.825
SO ARE YOU STILL GOING TO INSIST THAT I
ACCEPT YOUR "FRIENDSHIP" WITH LENNOX?

16:36.826 --> 16:39.118
(hesitantly) YES?

16:39.119 --> 16:40.919
OH, THEN I GUESS
THIS IS GOODBYE.

16:40.920 --> 16:44.043
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
UM, SO, HEY.

16:44.044 --> 16:48.006
MAYBE LENNOX AND I
COULD WORK TOGETHER,

16:48.007 --> 16:51.840
BUT AT YOUR HOUSE.
PROBLEM SOLVED, HUH?

16:51.841 --> 16:54.893
HUH?

16:54.894 --> 16:57.936
FACE IT, ZANDER. SHE'S NEVER
GOING TO LET YOU WORK WITH ME.

16:57.937 --> 17:00.599
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
WORKING ON THIS PROJECT WITH ME

17:00.600 --> 17:02.020
OR BEING LILAH'S BOYFRIEND.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.443
SHE'S RIGHT, YOU'VE
GOT TO CHOOSE.

17:04.444 --> 17:07.526
I MEAN, LENNOX, YOU... YOU'VE
ALWAYS STIMULATED MY MIND

17:07.527 --> 17:09.528
AND INSPIRED ME TO GREATNESS.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.861
AND, LILAH, YOU'VE STIMULATED
OTHER PARTS OF ME.

17:13.243 --> 17:16.785
ALTHOUGH I REALLY WISH
I COULD HAVE BOTH,

17:16.786 --> 17:20.749
I GUESS I HAVE TO GO WITH...
MY MIND.

17:20.750 --> 17:24.083
LILAH, I'M SORRY. WE'RE OVER.

17:24.084 --> 17:25.924
FINE.

17:25.925 --> 17:28.006
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO MISS ME
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT...

17:28.007 --> 17:29.798
AND IN THE MORNING...

17:29.799 --> 17:32.172
AND ON THE TRAPEZE.

17:37.887 --> 17:40.018
WOW.

17:40.019 --> 17:42.891
HA! YOU FINALLY STOOD
UP FOR YOURSELF.

17:42.892 --> 17:46.064
WAS IT SEXY?

17:46.065 --> 17:49.818
PROBABLY TO SOMEONE...
SOMEWHERE.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.031
LET'S GET TO WORK.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.785
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

17:57.867 --> 18:00.159
HEY, COME HERE.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.541
- I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
- JUST A MINUTE.

18:02.542 --> 18:05.124
HERE'S SOME DRAWINGS
I DID FOR SCHOOL.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.966
- MMM. -WANT TO TELL
ME HOW BAD THEY ARE?

18:07.967 --> 18:10.919
OR MAYBE YOU COULD JUST
FEED 'EM INTO A SHREDDER.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.091
WILL YOU GET OVER HERE, PLEASE?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.013
ECH! FINE.

18:15.014 --> 18:17.015
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:17.016 --> 18:19.017
I'D LIKE TO SING WITH YOU.

18:19.018 --> 18:22.771
BUT ISN'T MUSIC AN EVIL,
HEARTBREAKING WITCH OR SOMETHING?

18:22.772 --> 18:25.524
I MAY HAVE OVERSTATED
THAT SLIGHTLY, OKAY?

18:25.525 --> 18:28.858
LISTEN, I WANT YOU TO PLAY THAT SONG
YOU WERE PLAYING YESTERDAY, OKAY?

18:30.069 --> 18:31.860
