WEBVTT

00:38.021 --> 00:40.455
It was a long time ago.

00:40.532 --> 00:43.467
Sometimes I can still
hear their voices

00:43.535 --> 00:44.969
across Sally's woods.

00:45.038 --> 00:48.701
There was Billy, Steve, Tommy,

00:48.775 --> 00:52.211
and the tall kid from
down the street... Joey.

00:52.278 --> 00:54.212
Yeah, it was Joey Walsh.

00:54.280 --> 00:56.715
My best friend was Timmy Burns

00:56.784 --> 00:59.514
who lived two blocks
away from me.

01:00.688 --> 01:03.657
We turned the woods
into a battlefield

01:03.724 --> 01:08.025
and dreamed that someday
we would become men.

01:15.871 --> 01:17.270
Did you hear it?

01:17.339 --> 01:19.137
What?

01:26.949 --> 01:29.440
Let's go, Timmy!
Let's go!

01:35.826 --> 01:37.726
Come on, Major!

01:42.232 --> 01:44.497
They've got to be
somewhere, Ronnie.

01:44.569 --> 01:46.059
Watch out.

01:46.171 --> 01:48.867
You've got to stay
in the ravine.

01:48.940 --> 01:49.998
Shh.

01:51.376 --> 01:52.934
Shh.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.711
Go! Go! Go!

01:56.782 --> 01:58.579
Look, there they are!

01:58.651 --> 02:00.448
Wipe them out!

02:00.519 --> 02:02.749
Aah!

02:02.821 --> 02:04.311
Aah!

02:04.390 --> 02:05.516
Aah!
Aah!

02:05.591 --> 02:07.287
Aah!

02:07.360 --> 02:09.122
Aah!
Aah!

02:09.196 --> 02:11.426
You're dead, and you know it!

02:11.531 --> 02:13.123
No, I'm not!

02:13.233 --> 02:14.996
Ronnie's dead!

02:15.101 --> 02:17.569
No, I'm not!
No, I'm not!

02:51.274 --> 02:52.969
Look at the mayor.

02:53.042 --> 02:55.603
I wonder where your mom is.

02:58.182 --> 03:00.173
Where is that woman?

03:00.251 --> 03:02.242

Stevie Boyer
just gave Mary Barnett a ring.

03:47.135 --> 03:48.568
Can you believe it?

03:48.636 --> 03:50.103
Over there.

03:50.171 --> 03:51.103
O.K.

03:51.205 --> 03:52.696
Come here, come here.

03:52.808 --> 03:54.105
What is this?

03:54.209 --> 03:55.676
Is this a firecracker?

03:55.744 --> 03:56.711
What's wrong with you?

04:00.082 --> 04:01.640
Hey!

04:02.618 --> 04:04.712
Hey!

04:15.733 --> 04:17.166
This is boring.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.168
Yeah, square, man.

04:28.513 --> 04:31.004
Look, Daddy, the soldiers!

05:19.268 --> 05:21.293
Happy birthday, Ronnie Kovic.

05:21.370 --> 05:22.302
For me?

05:22.371 --> 05:23.804
Yes. Open it.

05:23.873 --> 05:25.306
That's really nice, Donna.

05:25.374 --> 05:26.808
Say thank you, Ronnie.

05:26.877 --> 05:29.937
Thanks, Donna, but
you didn't have to.

05:30.013 --> 05:31.708
Going to the woods tonight?

05:31.815 --> 05:33.214
They'll have fireworks there.

05:33.283 --> 05:35.251
Should be a real blast.

05:35.318 --> 05:36.216
Yeah, O.K.

05:36.286 --> 05:37.982
What is it?
Open it.

05:38.055 --> 05:39.613
Leave him alone.

05:40.725 --> 05:41.589
Beautiful.

05:41.659 --> 05:43.957
Hey, it's
the real thing, Ronnie.

05:44.028 --> 05:45.427
Feel that.

05:45.496 --> 05:47.259
Just like Mickey Mantle, Ronnie.

05:47.331 --> 05:49.766
Ain't he
a 4th of July firecracker

05:49.835 --> 05:51.234
in that hat?

05:51.303 --> 05:55.467
Yeah. He's my little
Yankee Doodle boy.

05:55.541 --> 05:58.408
Hey, get it!
Get it!

05:58.477 --> 06:00.001
Come on!

06:00.078 --> 06:01.842
Let's go!

06:30.445 --> 06:31.912
Did you like it?

06:31.980 --> 06:33.413
I don't know.

06:33.482 --> 06:34.915
I don't know.

06:34.983 --> 06:38.351
Hey, look how many
pushups I can do.

07:07.452 --> 07:09.249
Wow! Yeah!

07:09.320 --> 07:10.344
Yeah!

07:10.421 --> 07:12.754
Come on, Ronnie!

07:15.561 --> 07:18.029
Go, Ronnie, Go!

07:18.130 --> 07:20.564
Go, Ronnie!
You can do it!

07:20.633 --> 07:21.793
Go!

07:27.073 --> 07:30.440
Yes!

07:30.510 --> 07:34.173
Yes! That's my boy!

07:34.247 --> 07:36.113
That's my boy!

07:41.489 --> 07:43.320
Yes!

07:43.391 --> 07:47.351
Ronnie, you made it!

07:47.429 --> 07:50.592
Yeah, all right!

07:50.699 --> 07:54.328
Tommy! Ronnie!
Come on!

07:54.403 --> 07:56.564
You're going to miss it!

07:56.638 --> 07:58.869
Michelle! Barbara!

07:58.942 --> 08:00.603
You've got to see this!

08:00.677 --> 08:03.305
Not as a call to bear arms,

08:03.379 --> 08:04.812
though arms we need,

08:04.881 --> 08:07.543
but a call to bear the burden

08:07.617 --> 08:09.551
of a long twilight struggle,

08:09.619 --> 08:12.885
a struggle against
the common enemies of man...

08:12.957 --> 08:17.860
tyranny, poverty,
disease, and war itself.

08:17.928 --> 08:20.624
You'll get a licking
if you're late!

08:20.731 --> 08:23.360
In the long history
of the world,

08:23.468 --> 08:26.631
only a few generations
have been granted the role

08:26.705 --> 08:28.866
of defending freedom...

08:28.940 --> 08:30.339
Look, President Kennedy, Daddy.

08:30.408 --> 08:31.340
That's right.

08:31.409 --> 08:32.842
He's so handsome.

08:32.910 --> 08:35.607
I do not shrink
from this responsibility,

08:35.681 --> 08:37.910
I welcome it.

08:37.984 --> 08:41.943
Let the word go forth
from this time and place

08:42.020 --> 08:44.455
that the torch has been passed

08:44.523 --> 08:46.958
to a new generation of Americans

08:47.027 --> 08:50.190
born in this century.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.959
Let every nation know

08:53.066 --> 08:56.627
that we shall pay any price,

08:56.737 --> 08:59.070
bear any burden,

08:59.140 --> 09:03.804
support any friend,
oppose any foe

09:03.878 --> 09:05.869
to assure the survival

09:05.947 --> 09:07.744
and the success of liberty.

09:07.815 --> 09:10.785
I had a dream, Ronnie,
the other night,

09:10.853 --> 09:13.549
and you were speaking
to a large crowd

09:13.622 --> 09:15.283
just like him.

09:15.357 --> 09:16.756
Just like him.

09:16.825 --> 09:19.259
And you were saying
great things.

09:19.328 --> 09:21.229
And so, my fellow Americans,

09:21.297 --> 09:24.960
ask not what your country
can do for you,

09:25.068 --> 09:28.805
ask what you can do
for your country.

09:28.905 --> 09:31.135
Right! Right up!

09:31.207 --> 09:33.199
Get out!
Got to get out!

09:33.310 --> 09:34.709
You got to get out!

09:34.779 --> 09:36.212
You got to get out!

09:36.280 --> 09:38.805
Hit that switch!
Hit the switch!

09:41.152 --> 09:42.585
All right, hit the ropes!

09:42.653 --> 09:44.246
Go, go, go!

09:44.322 --> 09:45.880
Hand over hand over hand!

09:45.957 --> 09:47.857
Get those legs off those ropes!

09:47.926 --> 09:50.121
Come on, ladies,
let's come down!

09:50.195 --> 09:51.594
Let's come down!

09:51.663 --> 09:53.096
That rope is like life!

09:53.165 --> 09:55.690
You grab it
and hang onto it! Next!

09:55.767 --> 09:58.498
I want you to kill!

09:58.604 --> 09:59.696
You hear me?

09:59.806 --> 10:00.738
Yes, sir!

10:00.807 --> 10:01.739
Kill!

10:01.808 --> 10:03.241
I want that
conference championship!

10:03.309 --> 10:05.243
Do you want that conference
championship?

10:05.311 --> 10:06.300
Yes, sir!

10:06.412 --> 10:07.812
Get up! Heads!

10:07.881 --> 10:10.247
Get them up!
Do you hear me?

10:10.317 --> 10:13.650
Get your heads up, ladies!
Get your heads up!

10:13.721 --> 10:16.189
I want that
conference championship!

10:16.256 --> 10:19.225
If you want to win,
you got to suffer!

10:19.293 --> 10:21.228
You want to be the best?

10:21.296 --> 10:23.628
You got to pay the price
for victory,

10:23.698 --> 10:25.666
and the price is sacrifice!

10:25.734 --> 10:28.965
Susanne, no homework
at the table, please.

10:29.037 --> 10:31.028
No, Tommy.
After supper.

10:31.140 --> 10:32.004
Dad?

10:32.108 --> 10:33.006
Yeah?

10:33.109 --> 10:34.576
Can I come with you?

10:34.643 --> 10:36.543
There's the next
conference champion.

10:36.612 --> 10:38.079
Sorry I'm late, Ma.

10:38.147 --> 10:39.546
There's rice on the stove

10:39.615 --> 10:41.082
and fruit in the icebox.

10:41.150 --> 10:42.082
I can't.

10:42.151 --> 10:43.551
It's on your diet, right?

10:43.620 --> 10:46.555
I got to drop 3 pounds
by Saturday.

10:46.623 --> 10:48.557
Your brother's
a hard worker, Tommy,

10:48.625 --> 10:51.150
'cause he wants to be the best.

10:51.228 --> 10:53.992
Win or lose... in school,
in sports, in life...

10:54.064 --> 10:56.966
as long as you do your best,

10:57.034 --> 10:59.059
that's what matters to God.

10:59.137 --> 11:01.469
Win or lose, we still love him.

11:01.539 --> 11:03.473
Can I go to my room?

11:03.541 --> 11:04.473
Yeah, sure.

11:04.575 --> 11:06.476
Thank you, God, for this food.

11:06.545 --> 11:10.914
In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Ghost, amen.

11:10.983 --> 11:12.746
Daddy, Jimmy took my doll!

11:12.818 --> 11:14.251
I'll get the doll.

11:14.319 --> 11:15.718
I hate his guts!

11:15.788 --> 11:17.221
Just go to bed.

11:17.289 --> 11:18.723
I didn't take anything!

11:18.792 --> 11:20.225
Where's your sister's doll?

11:20.293 --> 11:23.160
Jackie? Why
is Jackie not in bed?

11:23.229 --> 11:24.321
Ronnie.

11:26.599 --> 11:28.089
Where'd you get this?

11:28.168 --> 11:30.637
Why are you in my room?

11:30.704 --> 11:32.535
Don't change the subject.

11:32.606 --> 11:35.473
I don't allow Playboy magazine
in this house.

11:35.543 --> 11:36.510
Stevie gave it to me.

11:36.577 --> 11:38.477
You have filthy,
impure thoughts!

11:38.579 --> 11:40.046
God's going to punish you.

11:40.147 --> 11:43.083
I haven't even looked
at it yet, all right?

11:43.151 --> 11:46.587
Go to confession. I want you
to tell Father McKenna.

11:46.655 --> 11:49.055
I don't want to see
this filthy magazine

11:49.124 --> 11:50.557
in my house again.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.115
Now, take this away!

11:52.194 --> 11:53.628
What's going on?

11:53.696 --> 11:54.594
Nothing.

11:54.664 --> 11:56.097
What do you mean, nothing?

11:56.165 --> 11:57.996
Nothing, Dad. O.K.?

12:08.779 --> 12:11.839
You're out of bounds, guys.
Back inside.

12:11.949 --> 12:15.009
Come on, Kovic, back inside.
Come on, Kovic.

12:16.253 --> 12:18.586
Go, Ronnie.

12:18.656 --> 12:21.124
Kovic, back inside.
Come on, Kovic.

12:21.226 --> 12:22.591
Back inside.
Let's go.

12:22.660 --> 12:24.628
I want to see some explosion!

12:24.696 --> 12:26.129
Come on, Ronnie!

12:26.197 --> 12:27.858
No messing around!

12:27.932 --> 12:29.901
You're great, Ronnie!
You're great, Ronnie!

12:29.969 --> 12:31.368
Stay with him!

12:31.437 --> 12:33.371
Come on down!
All right!

12:33.439 --> 12:35.373
O.K. Get off
the mat.

12:35.441 --> 12:36.840
You're going to get...

12:39.278 --> 12:41.747
Get him! Get him!
Get him! Get him!

12:41.815 --> 12:43.407
Reversal.
2 points!

12:43.483 --> 12:45.644
All right!

12:45.752 --> 12:47.515
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

12:47.621 --> 12:49.054
Ohh, you!

12:56.530 --> 12:58.623
One, red!
You're both up.

13:00.768 --> 13:03.328
All right, fresh start.
Fresh start.

13:03.404 --> 13:06.306
Stand up.
Don't let him get you!

13:06.375 --> 13:07.808
Don't let him get you!

13:07.876 --> 13:09.810
Pull him out!
All right!

13:09.878 --> 13:11.277
Watch those legs.
Watch him!

13:11.346 --> 13:14.076
Get him down!
Don't let him get the neck!

13:14.149 --> 13:15.742
No! No!

13:15.818 --> 13:17.376
No!

13:17.453 --> 13:19.580
You can beat him, Ronnie!

13:20.723 --> 13:22.782
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

13:22.892 --> 13:24.291
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!

13:26.896 --> 13:29.422
Bridge! Bridge!

13:29.500 --> 13:32.992
You can win!
Don't give up!

13:34.939 --> 13:36.668
Aah!

13:42.213 --> 13:45.080
Oh, no!

13:53.759 --> 13:55.317
O.K., son?

14:02.468 --> 14:03.936
Oh, no.

14:04.004 --> 14:06.063
Come on, get up.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.942
Attention!

14:13.013 --> 14:14.982
Forward march!

14:15.049 --> 14:17.244
Left, left.

14:17.318 --> 14:18.910
Left, right, left.

14:24.292 --> 14:26.056
Seats!

14:30.866 --> 14:32.493
Good morning.

14:32.601 --> 14:35.069
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hayes.

14:35.137 --> 14:36.570
This is Sergeant Bowers.

14:36.638 --> 14:40.473
United States Marine Recruiting Station,
Levittown, New York.

14:43.513 --> 14:45.071
We are here today

14:45.148 --> 14:48.242
at the request of your principal
Mr. Richards

14:48.318 --> 14:50.446
and other members of the faculty

14:50.521 --> 14:54.480
to tell you a little bit
about the Marine Corps.

14:54.558 --> 14:56.287
First off, young men,

14:56.360 --> 14:58.453
let's get one thing straight.

14:59.964 --> 15:03.924
Not everybody becomes
United States Marines.

15:04.036 --> 15:05.526
We want the best,

15:05.637 --> 15:08.071
and we'll accept nothing
but the best,

15:08.140 --> 15:10.108
because there
is nothing prouder,

15:10.175 --> 15:12.837
nothing finer, nothing
standing as straight

15:12.911 --> 15:15.881
as a United States Marine.

15:15.948 --> 15:18.007
Now, they've got the Army.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.052
They got the Navy.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.781
They got the Air Farce.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.324
And if you want to join them,

15:25.392 --> 15:26.791
be my guest.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.420
But if you want a challenge...

15:29.496 --> 15:32.693
if you want to try
something difficult...

15:32.800 --> 15:35.769
if you want to try to
achieve the impossible...

15:35.836 --> 15:38.738
you try 13 weeks of hell

15:38.807 --> 15:40.240
at Parris Island,
South Carolina,

15:40.308 --> 15:43.368
and you'll find out
if you got what it takes.

15:43.445 --> 15:46.778
You'll find out
if you really are a man,

15:46.848 --> 15:50.512
then the Marines may be
what you're looking for.

15:50.586 --> 15:51.951
Tarawa...

15:52.021 --> 15:53.249
Iwo Jima...

15:53.322 --> 15:55.847
Belleau Wood...

15:55.925 --> 15:58.257
the Frozen Chosan Reservoir.

16:00.030 --> 16:02.999
First to fight.
We have never lost a war.

16:03.066 --> 16:06.331
We have always come when
our country's called us.

16:06.436 --> 16:08.700
Now, Sergeant Bowers and I

16:08.805 --> 16:11.273
would like to open this up
to questions.

16:11.341 --> 16:14.743
So if any of you young men
do have questions,

16:14.812 --> 16:17.110
go ahead and raise your hands.

16:17.181 --> 16:19.115
Come on, now.
Don't be afraid.

16:19.183 --> 16:21.617
Don't forget, a good
Marine's a thinking Marine.

16:21.686 --> 16:23.051
Billy Vorsovich, sir.

16:23.121 --> 16:26.558
When would I get to wear
a uniform like you?

16:26.625 --> 16:29.395
You can be wearing this
in 13 weeks.

16:29.495 --> 16:30.962
Go! Go!

16:31.029 --> 16:32.724
Go, Massapequa!

16:32.798 --> 16:35.199
Go! Go! Go!

16:35.268 --> 16:37.065
Yay!
Yay!

16:40.840 --> 16:42.068
Hi, Donna.

16:44.611 --> 16:46.374
Go! Go!

16:46.446 --> 16:48.039
Go, Massapequa!

16:48.115 --> 16:49.309
Go!

16:49.383 --> 16:51.283
My brother's at school
at Adelphi.

16:51.352 --> 16:55.345
He said there will be a war in...
what is it?

16:55.456 --> 16:56.423
Vietnam.

16:56.490 --> 16:58.891
The Marines will be
the first in,

16:58.960 --> 17:00.928
and it won't last long.

17:01.029 --> 17:04.931
So if we don't sign up
soon, we'll miss it.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.434
I've already decided.
I'm going in.

17:07.502 --> 17:08.434
Really?

17:08.502 --> 17:09.935
Just like that?

17:10.005 --> 17:12.440
I'm not waiting.
I'm going in now.

17:12.508 --> 17:13.440
You're crazy.

17:13.509 --> 17:15.977
Our dads got to go to WWII.

17:16.045 --> 17:18.945
This is our chance
to be part of history.

17:19.015 --> 17:20.743
Yeah, just like our dads.

17:20.816 --> 17:22.682
Think about what you're doing.

17:24.087 --> 17:26.521
It could be dangerous
over there.

17:26.589 --> 17:28.615
You could get yourself killed.

17:28.692 --> 17:31.786
Where are you going,
squirrel head? College?

17:31.895 --> 17:34.228
I want to do something
with my life.

17:34.299 --> 17:36.699
I can get a degree in
Business Administration.

17:36.768 --> 17:38.963
You don't need
to serve your country?

17:39.037 --> 17:41.904
Don't you care
about anybody but yourself?

17:41.973 --> 17:43.406
Better dead than red.

17:43.474 --> 17:45.909
They got missiles pointed
at us everywhere. ICBMs.

17:45.978 --> 17:47.809
Coming in all around us.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.347
Cuba now.
90 miles away.

17:49.415 --> 17:50.814
They're taking over.

17:50.883 --> 17:52.214
When will we stop them?

17:52.284 --> 17:54.479
You can't stop them by yourself.

17:54.553 --> 17:56.418
Communism is
moving in everywhere.

17:56.488 --> 17:58.855
Where, Ronnie?
I don't see them.

17:58.925 --> 18:00.324
They're not here in Massapequa,

18:00.393 --> 18:02.793
so I'll just take care
of number one.

18:02.896 --> 18:04.864
That's right.
Me... Stevie, number one.

18:04.931 --> 18:07.866
Someone's got to stay
with the women and children

18:07.934 --> 18:10.335
while the men
go do the fighting.

18:10.404 --> 18:12.895
All I'm saying is,
think about it.

18:13.007 --> 18:14.440
Think about it, Ronnie.

18:14.508 --> 18:17.306
Stevie, who are you taking
to the prom?

18:17.378 --> 18:18.777
Wendy Daniels.

18:18.846 --> 18:19.778
Wendy Daniels?

18:19.847 --> 18:20.745
Wendy Daniels?

18:20.815 --> 18:22.545
He got desperate.

18:22.618 --> 18:25.086
Well, who are you taking,
Joey, your mother?

18:25.153 --> 18:29.089
Ronnie, who are you going
to take to the prom?

18:29.157 --> 18:30.590
You don't know her.

18:30.659 --> 18:32.628
She's a pretty girl
from Ronkonkoma.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.094
What's her name?

18:34.163 --> 18:35.357
You don't know her.

18:35.431 --> 18:37.331
What's her name, Ronnie?

18:37.433 --> 18:38.832
Her name is Lombardi.

18:38.901 --> 18:39.833
Lombardi?

18:39.902 --> 18:40.834
Yeah.

18:40.903 --> 18:42.495
Vince Lombardi?

18:42.605 --> 18:44.574
Rosanna Lombardi.

18:44.675 --> 18:46.609
She's from out of town, right?

18:46.677 --> 18:48.611
She going to get a motel?

18:48.679 --> 18:51.273
'Cause I'd like
to get in on that.

18:57.188 --> 19:00.157
Ronnie, would you take this
to section three?

19:00.225 --> 19:02.659
Check the stock for dog food.

19:02.727 --> 19:03.659
Dog food.

19:03.728 --> 19:05.696
Then finish
stacking the potatoes.

19:05.764 --> 19:07.163
Come on. Let's go.

19:07.232 --> 19:10.168
Let's do some work for a change.

19:10.269 --> 19:12.237
This goes in section three?

19:12.305 --> 19:13.237
Section three.

19:13.306 --> 19:14.500
O.K., Dad.

19:39.734 --> 19:41.497
Hey, Donna.

19:41.569 --> 19:42.661
Hi, Ronnie.

19:42.737 --> 19:43.534
Hi, Ronnie.

19:43.639 --> 19:44.264
Hi, Ronnie.

19:44.373 --> 19:46.432
How you doing?
How's...

19:46.542 --> 19:47.873
Good.

19:47.943 --> 19:51.379
I heard that you were going
into the Marines.

19:51.447 --> 19:52.675
Yeah, yeah.

19:52.748 --> 19:55.183
It's better than working at A&P.

19:55.251 --> 19:56.684
That's great, Ronnie.

19:56.753 --> 19:57.845
That's wonderful.

19:57.921 --> 19:59.855
I'm going to boot camp soon.

19:59.923 --> 20:01.857
I joined for four years,

20:01.925 --> 20:03.358
so I go to Vietnam,

20:03.426 --> 20:05.360
probably on the front line.

20:05.428 --> 20:06.554
Really?

20:06.630 --> 20:08.564
I'll see a lot of action.

20:08.632 --> 20:09.564
Wow.

20:09.633 --> 20:11.362
That's neat.

20:11.435 --> 20:13.869
Heard you got into that school.

20:13.938 --> 20:15.030
The letter?

20:15.106 --> 20:16.198
Yeah.

20:16.273 --> 20:17.763
Yeah, Syracuse.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.834
It's going to be really hard.

20:19.945 --> 20:23.381
Could I... Could I talk
to you in private?

20:23.448 --> 20:25.348
Oh, yeah. Sure.

20:29.121 --> 20:31.590
I've been meaning to call you.

20:31.657 --> 20:33.090
I was wondering,

20:33.159 --> 20:36.686
are you going with
someone to the prom?

20:36.763 --> 20:38.560
Yeah. I'm going
with Jed.

20:38.631 --> 20:40.098
Oh, yeah?
That's great.

20:40.166 --> 20:43.102
I mean, he's
a nice guy... Jed.

20:43.170 --> 20:44.603
Stevie Boyer told me

20:44.671 --> 20:48.038
that you were taking some girl
from Lake Ronkonkoma.

20:48.108 --> 20:49.541
Yeah. No, no.

20:49.610 --> 20:50.634
No?

20:50.744 --> 20:53.474
No. I don't have time
for that stuff.

20:53.581 --> 20:56.516
There's a lot of things
to take care of

20:56.584 --> 20:58.848
before you go in the Marines.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.548
I didn't even know
how much stuff.

21:01.623 --> 21:04.319

Mickey has two strikes

and the chance
to put the Yankees

22:12.766 --> 22:14.199
ahead in this game.

22:14.268 --> 22:16.203
The pitcher gets his sign,

22:16.271 --> 22:18.705
takes his stretch,
checks the runners.

22:18.773 --> 22:20.240
Here's the pitch.

22:20.308 --> 22:22.139
Mickey swings, and he connects!

22:22.210 --> 22:25.145
There's a long drive

22:25.213 --> 22:26.646

The First Cavalry Division

is the latest concept
in mobile warfare.

23:05.291 --> 23:06.724
One division is worth

23:06.792 --> 23:09.454
21/2 Russian
and 6 Chinese divisions.

23:09.528 --> 23:11.962
How well will
the individual soldier

23:12.031 --> 23:13.999
stand up here in Vietnam?

23:14.066 --> 23:17.798
What do you think,
Dad, about that?

23:17.904 --> 23:19.235
I don't know.

23:19.306 --> 23:20.773
13,000 miles...

23:20.874 --> 23:24.139
that's a long way to go
to fight a war.

23:24.210 --> 23:26.645
They fought the French
and the Japanese

23:26.714 --> 23:27.976
for 30 years.

23:28.049 --> 23:29.983
Can they be weeded out?

23:30.051 --> 23:32.019
Anything that lives in a cave

23:32.086 --> 23:33.485
can be weeded out.

23:33.554 --> 23:38.117
I just hope they send you
to Europe or Korea or...

23:38.193 --> 23:39.285
They can't.

23:39.361 --> 23:40.555
Someplace safe.

23:40.629 --> 23:43.564
Every Marine has
a tour of duty there.

23:43.632 --> 23:45.600
It's not like the Army.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.066
What's wrong with you?

23:47.135 --> 23:49.103
You served.
Uncle Bob served.

23:49.204 --> 23:50.900
I know, Ronnie.
I know.

23:51.007 --> 23:52.975
Remember what
President Kennedy said?

23:53.076 --> 23:54.941
There won't be
an America anymore

23:55.011 --> 23:57.411
unless people are willing
to sacrifice.

23:57.480 --> 23:58.879
I love my country.

23:58.948 --> 23:59.880
I know.

23:59.949 --> 24:01.416
And you're right, Ronnie.

24:01.485 --> 24:03.282
You're doing the right thing.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.151
Communism has to be stopped.

24:05.222 --> 24:07.520
It's God's will you go.

24:07.591 --> 24:09.149
We're proud of you.

24:09.226 --> 24:10.784
Be careful, that's all.

24:10.861 --> 24:12.624
Up there in Hanoi,

24:12.696 --> 24:15.632
they don't allow magazines,
newspapers, and televisions

24:15.700 --> 24:18.260
to cast doubts
on the military system.

24:18.336 --> 24:22.238
Don't you know what being a Marine
means to me, Dad?

24:22.340 --> 24:24.240
Ever since I was a kid,

24:24.309 --> 24:26.744
I've wanted to serve my country,

24:26.812 --> 24:28.245
And I want to go.

24:28.314 --> 24:30.248
I want to go to Vietnam,

24:30.316 --> 24:33.410
and I'll die there if I have to.

24:34.487 --> 24:37.457
The attitude of people
on the home front

24:37.524 --> 24:40.084
is very important in this war.

24:40.160 --> 24:43.095
Not a nice night for the prom.

24:43.163 --> 24:45.097
Can the South Vietnamese
government

24:45.165 --> 24:47.099
stand up to the North?

24:47.167 --> 24:48.601
We wouldn't be here

24:48.670 --> 24:50.228
if we didn't think so.

24:59.313 --> 25:01.680
Sometimes, God, I'm so confused.

25:04.653 --> 25:06.917
Sometimes I think I'd just...

25:07.990 --> 25:10.959
like to stay here in Massapequa

25:11.026 --> 25:12.756
and never leave...

25:15.198 --> 25:16.927
but I got to go.

25:21.805 --> 25:23.204
Just help me, Jesus.

25:23.273 --> 25:25.936
Help me to make
the right decision.

25:27.878 --> 25:29.641
Please, dear God.

25:56.542 --> 25:57.975
Ron.

25:58.044 --> 25:59.945
Ronnie, what happened to you?

26:00.013 --> 26:01.105
Ronnie.

26:16.431 --> 26:17.989
What...

26:18.066 --> 26:19.590
Oh, Jeez.

26:20.769 --> 26:21.997
Donna.

26:22.070 --> 26:23.038
Ronnie.

26:23.105 --> 26:25.198
Will you dance with me?

26:26.375 --> 26:28.343
Oh, yes.

26:28.410 --> 26:30.002
Yeah, sure.

2-Alpha, 2-Alpha,
this is 6, over.

27:59.376 --> 28:00.968
6, 6,
2-Actual, over.

28:01.044 --> 28:03.308
2-Actual, this is 6.
That's a roger.

28:03.380 --> 28:05.177
You have beaucoup gooks.

28:05.249 --> 28:06.648
They're coming at you.

28:06.717 --> 28:08.515
Echo-1's
pushing them. Over.

28:08.586 --> 28:09.917
6, 6, 2-Actual.

28:09.988 --> 28:11.319
Sit Rep as follows...

28:11.389 --> 28:13.357
two set in on the beach.

28:13.424 --> 28:15.289
The tracks are moving this way.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.851
Sounds like
beaucoup gooks in there.

28:17.929 --> 28:20.398
I'm finally going to see one.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.331
Relax, you'll be all right.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.959
Where you from, Wilson?

28:24.069 --> 28:25.969
First Battalion,
Ninth Motor "T."

28:26.038 --> 28:28.973
The Sergeant Major said the grunts
needed replacements,

28:29.041 --> 28:32.273
so they took me out
of battalion supply.

28:32.345 --> 28:34.745
Where are you from in the world?

28:34.814 --> 28:36.247
Oh, Venus, Georgia.

28:36.316 --> 28:37.977
This is my second tour.

28:38.051 --> 28:41.020
I haven't seen a Georgia boy
get hurt yet.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.486
You'll be all right.

28:42.555 --> 28:45.286
Echo-6, Echo-6,
Snake 1-9er...

28:46.928 --> 28:48.156
All right.

28:48.229 --> 28:51.323
Echo-1's taking incoming
northwest edge of the ville.

28:52.300 --> 28:54.825
We got gooks moving this way.

28:54.936 --> 28:56.370
Look out there, Sergeant.

28:56.438 --> 28:57.871
Can you see them?

28:57.940 --> 28:59.703
Right there.
You see them?

28:59.775 --> 29:01.538
They got rifles.

29:01.610 --> 29:03.544
Can you see the rifles?

29:03.612 --> 29:05.375
Right there.
You see them?

29:05.447 --> 29:06.881
You see them?

29:06.950 --> 29:08.611
Can you see the rifles?

29:08.685 --> 29:11.586
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

29:11.654 --> 29:13.053
Pass the word.

29:13.122 --> 29:14.749
When I give the order,

29:14.824 --> 29:16.553
I want to light up this ville

29:16.626 --> 29:18.059
like a motherfucking
Christmas tree.

29:18.127 --> 29:20.824
This time I think we got them!
Move out.

29:20.898 --> 29:23.298
Pass the word!
Fire on command!

29:23.400 --> 29:24.458
Wilson, come with me.

29:24.568 --> 29:25.796
Cover that big hooch!

29:25.903 --> 29:28.337
Fire on my command!
Pass the word!

29:28.405 --> 29:30.840
Corporal, start ranking.
Fire on my command!

29:30.909 --> 29:32.342
Fire on my command!

29:33.812 --> 29:34.779
Cease-fire!

29:34.846 --> 29:36.040
What happened?

29:36.114 --> 29:39.083
What the fuck are you doing?

29:42.154 --> 29:43.883
Cease-fire!

29:43.956 --> 29:45.355
What happened?

29:46.392 --> 29:47.359
Cease-fire!

29:47.426 --> 29:49.894
I want to know what happened!

29:49.962 --> 29:51.190
I don't know, sir.

29:51.263 --> 29:52.573
Possible accidental
discharge, sir.

29:52.598 --> 29:54.897
We better get
a sweep team in there.

29:54.968 --> 29:57.903
Take five men.
Tell me how many we got.

29:57.971 --> 29:58.903
Yes, sir.

29:58.972 --> 30:00.337
Motherfucker!

30:00.407 --> 30:02.307
Baldy on me!

30:02.376 --> 30:04.742
Brooks!
Martinez! On me!

30:04.811 --> 30:06.245
Wilson!
Wilson, on me!

30:06.314 --> 30:09.249
2-alpha, moving on the ville
at this time. Over.

30:09.317 --> 30:10.909
Line! Line! Line!

30:13.321 --> 30:15.221
Ironhand for fire mission.

30:15.289 --> 30:16.756
Stand by.

30:16.824 --> 30:21.660
Grid... 1-5-6-3-7-9er.

30:21.730 --> 30:23.163
Direction... 5-800.

30:23.232 --> 30:25.700
Gooks in the ville, Battery 6.

30:25.768 --> 30:27.167
Victor, Tango in effect.

30:27.269 --> 30:28.702
How copy? Over.

30:28.771 --> 30:29.704
Baldy! Baldy!

30:29.773 --> 30:31.741

30:31.808 --> 30:34.208
Get him out!
Get him out!

30:34.277 --> 30:36.211
Come on, Baldy, come on.

30:36.279 --> 30:38.713
Check it out over there!
Everything out!

30:38.782 --> 30:40.215
Baldy, get everything out!

30:40.283 --> 30:42.252
Baldy! There!
Check it out!

30:42.319 --> 30:43.547
Echo-2, Alpha.

30:43.621 --> 30:46.055
Echo-2,
send your Sit Rep. Over.

30:46.123 --> 30:47.852
Lai dai! Lai dai!

30:47.925 --> 30:49.256
Lai dai! Lai dai!

30:49.326 --> 30:50.554
Get him out!

30:50.628 --> 30:51.890
Get him out!

30:51.962 --> 30:54.261
Check those hooches
and clear ASAP.

30:54.332 --> 30:57.062
We've got a fire mission
inbound. Over.

30:57.969 --> 31:00.233
Oh, my God.

31:00.338 --> 31:03.774
We didn't do this, did we?

31:03.842 --> 31:05.276
Oh, my God.

31:05.344 --> 31:06.777
Jesus Christ.

31:06.846 --> 31:08.040
Oh, my God.

31:10.917 --> 31:14.114
2-Actual-2, better get down
here quick,

31:14.187 --> 31:15.950
and bring the corpsmen.

31:16.023 --> 31:19.322
We got beaucoup wounded.
Civilians.

31:19.393 --> 31:21.725
Martinez, help me!

31:24.798 --> 31:26.629
We wasted them.

31:26.700 --> 31:30.330
Motherfucker!
We wasted them!

31:31.673 --> 31:33.163
Oh!

31:43.652 --> 31:45.051
Destroy.

31:45.121 --> 31:46.679
Where are the rifles?

31:47.790 --> 31:49.189
Where are the rifles?

31:49.258 --> 31:51.158
There ain't no fucking rifles.

31:51.228 --> 31:52.559
Damn it.

31:52.629 --> 31:54.096
Jesus fucking Christ!

31:54.164 --> 31:55.563
Well, help him then!

31:55.632 --> 31:58.100
Help him!
Help him! Help him!

31:58.168 --> 32:00.227
Oh, motherfuck...

32:01.171 --> 32:03.572
I want you to help him.

32:03.641 --> 32:04.573
Forgive us.

32:04.642 --> 32:06.974
Help me!
Somebody help me!

32:10.047 --> 32:11.480
6, 6, 2-Actual.

32:11.549 --> 32:13.073
Request emergency medevac.

32:13.184 --> 32:15.949
We got a lot
of friendly wounded. Over.

32:16.021 --> 32:17.283
Get out of there!

32:17.356 --> 32:19.790
Leave those wounded!
You got Arty inbound!

32:19.858 --> 32:21.052
Get out! Get out!

32:21.126 --> 32:23.287
Get back to the dunes!

32:23.362 --> 32:26.160
We got gooks
in the ville! Move out!

32:26.231 --> 32:27.961
Get out! Move out!

32:28.034 --> 32:29.296
That's a direct order!

32:29.369 --> 32:31.360
I want you out that door!

32:31.437 --> 32:33.598
It wasn't your fault,
goddamn it!

32:33.673 --> 32:36.574
They got in the goddamned way!

32:36.643 --> 32:38.076
Get off the deck!

32:38.144 --> 32:40.670
We got gooks in the ville!

32:40.781 --> 32:42.373
The baby!

32:42.483 --> 32:44.075
Get back to the dune!

32:44.185 --> 32:45.117
The baby!

32:45.186 --> 32:46.619
No! Move out!
Let's move!

32:46.687 --> 32:48.655
Kovic, move!

32:48.756 --> 32:50.054
Move out!

32:50.125 --> 32:51.592
Move out!
Move! Move!

32:51.660 --> 32:55.721
The ville is going to blow!

33:10.546 --> 33:11.774
Aah!

33:18.255 --> 33:21.588
Red! Abbot!

33:37.476 --> 33:41.537
Aah!

33:49.422 --> 33:51.083
Wilson!

33:51.191 --> 33:52.522
Wilson's hit!

34:34.637 --> 34:36.799
What happened?

34:36.873 --> 34:38.306
Where's First Platoon?

34:38.375 --> 34:40.239
For God's sake, Corpsman!

34:43.447 --> 34:45.312
Where's my "A" gunner?

35:15.182 --> 35:17.742
Sergeant Kovic
here to see you, sir.

35:17.818 --> 35:19.410
Stand easy, sergeant.

35:21.121 --> 35:23.215
Yeah, Kovic,
the lieutenant told me

35:23.291 --> 35:25.486
that was a pretty rough time.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.824
Yes, sir.
It was pretty bad.

35:27.929 --> 35:29.954
Ran into a few of them?

35:30.064 --> 35:31.224
Yes, sir.

35:32.367 --> 35:35.337
You want to see me
about something, Sergeant?

35:35.437 --> 35:36.563
Yes, sir.

35:36.638 --> 35:39.573
Like I said to the captain,
uh, sir...

35:39.641 --> 35:42.576
it was a very confusing day.

35:42.644 --> 35:43.770
The villagers...

35:43.846 --> 35:46.748
Yeah. I know about
the villagers, Sergeant.

35:46.816 --> 35:48.249
They...
the villagers...

35:48.318 --> 35:50.252
It was very, very unfortunate.

35:50.320 --> 35:52.652
The enemy used
the villagers as cover.

35:52.722 --> 35:53.814
Yes, sir.

35:54.924 --> 35:57.188
They popped up, started firing.

35:57.260 --> 35:59.058
We were running back, sir.

35:59.130 --> 36:00.597
It was real glary.

36:00.698 --> 36:02.097
Very confusing,

36:02.199 --> 36:04.793
and that's when
it happened, sir.

36:04.902 --> 36:06.130
What happened?

36:06.237 --> 36:09.138
Sir, that was when
Wilson was killed, sir.

36:09.206 --> 36:11.471
Yeah, I know about Wilson.

36:11.543 --> 36:13.135
Sir, see...

36:13.211 --> 36:15.645
he was the last one out,

36:15.714 --> 36:18.148
and that's when
it happened, sir.

36:18.216 --> 36:20.184
Sir, I think I might...

36:20.252 --> 36:22.653
I might have killed him, sir.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.121
I don't think so.

36:24.190 --> 36:26.590
He was coming up over the dune.

36:26.659 --> 36:29.287
I think I might have killed him.

36:29.362 --> 36:30.454
It's hard.

36:30.530 --> 36:33.193
I was out a couple of weeks ago.

36:33.267 --> 36:36.395
Sometimes it's... very hard
to tell what's happening.

36:38.338 --> 36:39.566
Yes, sir.

36:40.841 --> 36:43.935
But, sir, I think
I killed Wilson.

36:50.218 --> 36:52.083
I don't think so, Kovic.

36:52.153 --> 36:55.418
But, sir, I want you
to know that...

36:55.490 --> 36:56.422
Don't talk like that!

36:56.491 --> 36:57.959
Don't tell me this shit.

36:58.027 --> 37:00.325
I'll take your head off.
Is that clear?

37:00.396 --> 37:01.328
Yes, sir.

37:01.397 --> 37:02.329
That clear?

37:02.398 --> 37:03.490
Yes, sir!

37:03.566 --> 37:04.624
All right.

37:06.168 --> 37:07.897
Carry on.

37:11.274 --> 37:14.539
X.O. Ought to
court-martial his ass.

37:18.114 --> 37:19.547
Sergeant K.

38:04.164 --> 38:06.632
Get some sugar in the blood.

38:06.700 --> 38:08.931
Ain't no thing, dog.

38:09.004 --> 38:11.529
Ain't nothing but a thing, baby.

38:11.606 --> 38:16.407
It's so hot out here, I want
to kill some motherfucking gooks.

38:16.478 --> 38:17.988
Dog, you're sounding
like a bitch, man.

38:18.013 --> 38:20.482
Ain't nothing but a thing.

38:20.550 --> 38:22.074
Nothing but a thing.

38:22.151 --> 38:25.052
It's so hot out
in this motherfucker,

38:25.121 --> 38:27.180
this must be hell!

38:30.126 --> 38:31.685
Or purgatory.

38:33.397 --> 38:36.423
Where's the motherfucking devil at?

38:51.182 --> 38:52.774
Take cover!

38:52.850 --> 38:54.978
Take cover!

39:01.193 --> 39:03.252
Take cover!

39:10.303 --> 39:11.793
Snake 1-9er airborne,

39:11.871 --> 39:13.304
Be advised machine guns

39:13.373 --> 39:15.637
now approaching
at your 12. Over.

39:15.709 --> 39:17.301
No. No, people!

39:17.377 --> 39:19.539
Move forward!
Move forward!

39:19.614 --> 39:21.809
Gun up! Gun up!

What do we have?

43:12.198 --> 43:14.133
His kidney and liver are gone.

43:14.201 --> 43:16.669
We better just kiss
this one goodbye.

43:16.737 --> 43:18.136
All right, take off.

they've got to operate.

44:09.961 --> 44:11.930
There's something wrong with me.

44:11.997 --> 44:13.624
The doctors are real busy.

44:13.699 --> 44:15.633
There's a lot of wounded here.

44:15.701 --> 44:17.293
There's no time for anything

44:17.369 --> 44:19.166
except trying to stay alive.

44:19.238 --> 44:21.798
You got to try
and stay alive. O. K?

44:21.874 --> 44:23.399
Try and stay alive.

44:23.476 --> 44:27.572
I've come to give you
your last rites.

Are you ready?

44:30.951 --> 44:32.851
I'm ready, Father.

44:36.791 --> 44:39.259
I am the resurrection
and the life.

He that believeth in me,

44:40.995 --> 44:43.293
though he were dead,
yet shall he live.

44:43.364 --> 44:45.264
We brought nothing
into this world,

44:45.333 --> 44:47.825
and it's certain
we can take nothing out.

44:47.903 --> 44:50.872
The Lord giveth, and
the Lord taketh away.

44:50.939 --> 44:58.939

Honey, anything you want.

51:17.325 --> 51:18.223

51:19.293 --> 51:20.225

51:48.792 --> 51:49.725
Easy now.

51:49.794 --> 51:51.386
Easy now.

51:52.496 --> 51:53.394
Very good.

51:53.464 --> 51:54.396
Hey, Doc...

51:54.465 --> 51:56.729
it's really beautiful up here.

51:56.801 --> 51:59.065
Ha ha ha!

52:05.343 --> 52:07.777
I'm walking out of here, guys.

52:07.846 --> 52:09.313
You'll see.
Right, Willie?

52:09.381 --> 52:10.780
Right.

52:10.849 --> 52:11.816
Easy.

52:11.883 --> 52:14.580
Oh... I'm all right.
I'm all right.

52:14.654 --> 52:16.622
O.K. That's enough
for today.

52:18.391 --> 52:19.790
O.K.
Now, good. Good.

52:19.859 --> 52:22.828
Easy, now. Easy, now.
Don't go too far.

52:22.895 --> 52:24.294
Don't do too much.

52:24.364 --> 52:26.559
Looking good today.
Looking good.

52:26.633 --> 52:28.157
Don't go too far.

52:28.235 --> 52:29.133
All right!

52:29.203 --> 52:31.194
Way to go, Kovic.

52:31.271 --> 52:32.203
Amazing, huh?

52:32.272 --> 52:34.206
Nothing from the chest down.

52:34.274 --> 52:37.244
It can be done.
It can be done.

52:37.312 --> 52:38.904
Semper fi, motherfucker!

52:39.013 --> 52:39.980
All right!

52:40.081 --> 52:41.514
All right, Harry, man.

52:41.583 --> 52:43.483
Keep it going. Let's go!

52:43.551 --> 52:45.348
Let's go. Let's go.

52:45.420 --> 52:46.546
Let's go.

52:46.621 --> 52:47.850
Aah!

52:47.923 --> 52:48.855
Oh!

52:48.924 --> 52:49.891
Willie!

52:49.959 --> 52:51.859
I think I need...

52:51.927 --> 52:53.360
Oh! Oh.

52:53.429 --> 52:54.896
Get him up.
Somebody...

52:54.964 --> 52:56.932
Something snapped.
It's my neck.

52:56.999 --> 52:57.966
All right.

52:58.033 --> 52:59.500
Just my neck.

52:59.568 --> 53:01.264
Ah, shit! Harry!

53:01.338 --> 53:02.805
Hang on. Hang on.

53:02.873 --> 53:04.067
What was that sound?

53:04.140 --> 53:05.072
Oh, shit.

53:05.141 --> 53:06.506
What?

53:06.576 --> 53:07.634
Oh!

53:07.711 --> 53:09.679
It's fine.
We're doing fine.

53:09.746 --> 53:11.145
Is that my bone?

53:11.214 --> 53:13.206
Harry, Harry, get a doc.

53:13.317 --> 53:14.716
Am I O.K.?

53:14.785 --> 53:17.310
It's O.K. Everybody relax.
Harry! Let's go!

53:17.421 --> 53:18.513
Oh, fuck.

53:18.623 --> 53:20.454
Shit.
Fuck.

55:22.024 --> 55:23.821
Washington!

55:25.560 --> 55:27.494
Washington,
where the fuck were you?

55:27.562 --> 55:29.996
I've been pushing
this call button

55:30.065 --> 55:33.001
and staring at my own vomit
for two hours.

55:33.069 --> 55:35.503
What's the matter
with you fucking people?

55:35.571 --> 55:38.005
I'm laying in my own shit.

55:38.074 --> 55:40.542
Why don't you change the sheets?

55:40.610 --> 55:42.043
This goddamned fucking place.

55:42.111 --> 55:43.510
I need a bath.

55:43.579 --> 55:46.515
Don't be raising
your voice to me!

55:46.583 --> 55:48.050
You watch your mouth.

55:48.118 --> 55:50.018
Why don't you help me?

55:50.087 --> 55:52.021
What's the matter with you?

55:52.089 --> 55:53.522
I don't feel right.

55:53.590 --> 55:56.025
I need to see the doctor now!

55:56.094 --> 55:57.561
He's not available now.

55:57.629 --> 55:59.529
I want to see him now!

55:59.631 --> 56:01.064
He's always too busy.

56:01.132 --> 56:02.565
What's eating you now?

56:02.634 --> 56:04.568
You going off the deep end?

56:04.636 --> 56:06.069
We'll amputate that leg,

56:06.137 --> 56:08.072
you go on like this.

56:08.140 --> 56:10.574
Don't put your hands on me.

56:10.643 --> 56:13.111
I want to be treated
like a human being.

56:13.179 --> 56:15.079
I don't want any of that shit!

56:15.147 --> 56:16.580
Trying to
keep me fucking drugged

56:16.649 --> 56:19.619
so I don't know what's going on.

56:19.686 --> 56:21.085
This is a fucking slum.

56:21.154 --> 56:22.519
We take that leg,

56:22.589 --> 56:24.557
you're out in two weeks.

56:24.624 --> 56:26.057
I want my leg.

56:26.126 --> 56:28.060
Why?
You can't feel it.

56:28.128 --> 56:31.030
It's my leg.
I want my leg.

56:31.099 --> 56:32.532
Can't you understand that?

56:32.633 --> 56:35.568
I want to be treated
like a human being.

56:35.636 --> 56:37.604
I fought for my country.

56:37.672 --> 56:39.071
I'm a Vietnam veteran!

56:39.140 --> 56:41.074
I fought for my country!

56:41.142 --> 56:42.609
Shut the fuck up!

56:42.677 --> 56:45.579
I should be treated decent!

56:45.647 --> 56:48.548
Vietnam don't mean
nothing to me, man,

56:48.617 --> 56:51.814
or any of these other people.
You got it?

56:51.887 --> 56:54.082
You can take your Vietnam

56:54.156 --> 56:57.126
and shove it up your ass,
you hear?

56:57.193 --> 56:59.684
No! I don't
need this!

56:59.763 --> 57:01.162
Hey, you fuck!

57:01.231 --> 57:04.132
Hey, goddamn you!

57:04.200 --> 57:05.690
Goddamn it.

57:05.802 --> 57:07.703
I am a fucking Vietnam veteran!

57:09.940 --> 57:10.838
This isn't...

57:10.908 --> 57:11.875
Marvin!

57:11.942 --> 57:12.840
Marvin, now!

57:12.910 --> 57:13.877
Marvin!

57:13.944 --> 57:15.343
What's up?
What's up?

57:15.412 --> 57:16.344
Marvin, look!

57:16.413 --> 57:17.437
Oh, fuck!

57:17.515 --> 57:18.483
It's off.

57:18.550 --> 57:19.983
It ain't going to work.

57:20.051 --> 57:20.949
Start!

57:21.019 --> 57:22.418
Washington, get the doctor.

57:22.487 --> 57:23.886
Wait a minute.

57:23.955 --> 57:26.549
OK. Yeah.
All right. I will.

57:26.625 --> 57:28.024
How you doing, Eddie?

57:28.093 --> 57:29.959
Let's see what's
wrong with this.

57:30.029 --> 57:33.226
They tell me if we don't
get this pump working,

57:33.299 --> 57:36.462
they'll cut my leg off.
I want my leg.

57:36.536 --> 57:37.969
Do we have another pump?

57:38.037 --> 57:40.198
It's the only one, Eddie.

57:40.306 --> 57:41.672
Ron. It's Ron Kovic.

57:41.742 --> 57:43.573
Sorry, man. Ron.

57:43.644 --> 57:45.942
You... You are a doctor?

57:46.013 --> 57:48.106
It's the Vietnam war.
Cutbacks.

57:48.182 --> 57:50.377
The government's not giving us
the money we need

57:50.450 --> 57:52.475
to take care of you guys.

57:52.553 --> 57:55.523
We're doing our best.
It's really too bad.

57:55.590 --> 57:56.989
It's not fair.

57:57.058 --> 57:59.686
I've tried hard
to keep this leg.

57:59.761 --> 58:02.730
I've been strapped in
this bed for four months

58:02.797 --> 58:05.198
so I could keep this leg.

58:05.267 --> 58:07.701
Maybe I can rig up a substitute.

58:07.770 --> 58:11.706
I'll look in the basement
and see what we got.

58:11.774 --> 58:13.207
You're coming back?

58:13.309 --> 58:14.571
Soon.

58:14.677 --> 58:16.737
Let go, Ron.
Let go.

58:18.815 --> 58:21.978
We really did try
to help Mr. Kovic.

58:52.518 --> 58:53.268
Aah!

59:06.600 --> 59:08.158
Susanne, he's here.

59:08.269 --> 59:09.429
Ronnie's home.

59:17.112 --> 59:18.511
O.K. Out on 3.

59:18.580 --> 59:20.047
All right, 1...

59:20.115 --> 59:21.047
2...

59:21.116 --> 59:21.946
3.

59:22.017 --> 59:23.450
Oh, that's great.

59:23.518 --> 59:25.952
Did you paint the house, Dad?

59:26.021 --> 59:27.489
Yeah. I painted it.

59:27.556 --> 59:28.955
Yellow. It looks good.

59:29.025 --> 59:30.424
It looks pretty good.

59:30.493 --> 59:33.326
I got that.
That's all right. Let's go.

59:33.396 --> 59:35.796
The kids have been
talking about you.

59:35.898 --> 59:38.332
They can't wait to see you.

59:38.401 --> 59:41.394
It's great to be back
in the neighborhood.

59:41.505 --> 59:43.939
I got it. I got it.

59:44.007 --> 59:46.475
Everything looks so different.

59:47.544 --> 59:48.909
Major.

59:48.979 --> 59:49.911
Hey, Major.

59:49.980 --> 59:52.415
Major, you know who this is?

59:52.483 --> 59:53.415
Yeah.

59:53.484 --> 59:55.418
You know who this is?

59:55.486 --> 59:56.919
He's gotten old, huh?

59:56.988 --> 59:58.922
Just like your old man.

59:58.990 --> 01:00:00.321
Hey, Tommy.

01:00:00.391 --> 01:00:01.824
Good to see you.

01:00:01.893 --> 01:00:03.020
Look at that hair.

01:00:03.095 --> 01:00:05.529
Dad lets you look like that?

01:00:05.597 --> 01:00:07.224
I don't have much say.

01:00:07.299 --> 01:00:08.766
How are you, Jimmy?

01:00:08.867 --> 01:00:11.768
Good to have you home.
You're out for good?

01:00:11.837 --> 01:00:13.304
I'm out for good.

01:00:13.372 --> 01:00:15.671
Patty, gee, look at you.

01:00:15.742 --> 01:00:16.674
Timmy.

01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:17.641
That's Jackie.

01:00:17.711 --> 01:00:18.643
Jackie?

01:00:18.712 --> 01:00:21.408
I wanted to visit you
in the hospital.

01:00:21.481 --> 01:00:24.382
How many pull-ups
you do, huh?

01:00:24.451 --> 01:00:27.353
You know, I did 23...
23 pull-ups.

01:00:27.421 --> 01:00:29.889
23 pull...
I'm O.K. I'm O.K.

01:00:29.957 --> 01:00:31.720
I'm all right.

01:00:31.792 --> 01:00:32.759
Ronnie.

01:00:32.827 --> 01:00:33.759
Susanne.

01:00:33.828 --> 01:00:35.728
Good to have you home.

01:00:35.796 --> 01:00:38.595
You didn't tell me
she was this beautiful.

01:00:38.667 --> 01:00:40.100
She's a woman, huh?

01:00:40.168 --> 01:00:41.100
I'm sorry.

01:00:41.203 --> 01:00:44.138
That's O.K. I can't
feel anything anyway.

01:00:44.206 --> 01:00:45.571
I'm only paralyzed.

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.801
You look great.

01:00:47.909 --> 01:00:48.876
Yeah?

01:00:48.977 --> 01:00:51.776
Ronnie.

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:52.906
Mom.

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:54.748
Ronnie.

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:56.284
Hey, Mom.

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:58.081
Oh, look at your hair.

01:00:58.154 --> 01:00:59.621
It looks great.

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:01.089
You like it?

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:02.989
Oh, you look beautiful.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:04.186
Thanks.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.597
It's good to be home.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:10.633
It's better than seeing me

01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:12.100
at that hospital, huh?

01:01:12.169 --> 01:01:13.603
It's O.K.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.161
I know.

01:01:15.273 --> 01:01:16.467
I'm O.K.

01:01:16.574 --> 01:01:17.802
I'm O.K.

01:01:17.909 --> 01:01:21.174
It's good to
have you home, Ronnie.

01:01:21.246 --> 01:01:24.113
Gee, everybody looks so good.

01:01:24.182 --> 01:01:26.378
Everybody looks so good.

01:01:26.519 --> 01:01:30.114
I'm going to go inside
for a minute.

01:01:30.189 --> 01:01:31.622
Mom, wait.

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:33.089
She'll be O.K.

01:01:33.159 --> 01:01:36.094
Ronnie, how are you, man?
You look good.

01:01:36.162 --> 01:01:37.596
Ronnie, you look good.

01:01:37.664 --> 01:01:38.596
Welcome home.

01:01:38.665 --> 01:01:41.099
It's so good to see you.

01:01:41.168 --> 01:01:43.136
Welcome home.
Nice to see you.

01:01:43.203 --> 01:01:45.603
Look at Harry.
You look good.

01:01:45.672 --> 01:01:46.639
Welcome home.

01:01:46.706 --> 01:01:48.698
Let's go in the house and help.

01:01:51.279 --> 01:01:53.713
Come on, Mom.
It's all right.

01:01:53.781 --> 01:01:54.713
Looks good.

01:01:54.782 --> 01:01:56.044
Yeah?

01:01:58.286 --> 01:01:59.753
You need some help?

01:01:59.822 --> 01:02:01.221
No. I'm O.K., Dad.

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:04.225
Fixed up a bathroom
for you, Ronnie.

01:02:04.293 --> 01:02:06.727
Put a wider doorway in.

01:02:06.795 --> 01:02:09.730
I built a shower for you, too.

01:02:09.798 --> 01:02:12.734
You can get in here pretty easy.

01:02:12.802 --> 01:02:15.236
Oh, and I put some handles

01:02:15.305 --> 01:02:17.398
on the toilet for you.

01:02:18.308 --> 01:02:19.275
Ronnie.

01:02:19.342 --> 01:02:20.400
Thanks, Dad.

01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:48.763
It's really great
to be back in my room.

01:02:59.386 --> 01:03:01.479
It's good to have you.

01:03:02.856 --> 01:03:05.450
It's good to have you, Ronnie.

01:03:13.401 --> 01:03:15.301
Come on, I'll show you...

01:03:16.704 --> 01:03:19.673
I'll show you
some new stuff we got

01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:21.800
in the bedroom over here.

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.646
My Happauge Boyer's grossed
85 grand last six months.

01:03:26.715 --> 01:03:29.684
My competitor's rushing in to build,
but I was first.

01:03:29.752 --> 01:03:31.219
The people are loyal.

01:03:31.287 --> 01:03:33.687
You probably think
it's just a hamburger.

01:03:33.756 --> 01:03:36.692
A patty's just a piece of meat,

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.193
but it can have character.

01:03:38.261 --> 01:03:39.694
See that doughnut hole?

01:03:39.763 --> 01:03:43.028
Gets 18 patties to the pound
instead of 16.

01:03:43.099 --> 01:03:45.534
Saves me about $40,000 a year.

01:03:45.603 --> 01:03:46.763
That's serious money, Ron.

01:03:46.837 --> 01:03:48.270
I plug the hole

01:03:48.339 --> 01:03:50.307
with lettuce, tomatoes,
onions, spices.

01:03:50.374 --> 01:03:52.706
I cover it with a pickle.

01:03:52.777 --> 01:03:53.753
They'll never miss a thing.

01:03:53.778 --> 01:03:54.403
They'll never miss a thing.

01:03:54.478 --> 01:03:57.414
Give me a good one
for Ronnie. Thanks.

01:03:57.482 --> 01:03:58.915
Good job. Try this.

01:03:58.984 --> 01:04:01.953
You don't find that
at McDonald's on Sunrise.

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.284
I got a drive-in
window, too.

01:04:04.389 --> 01:04:05.822
It's Long Island's first.

01:04:05.891 --> 01:04:07.825
It's clean,
it's cheap, it's fast.

01:04:07.893 --> 01:04:09.828
Feed the family
for $3.95.

01:04:09.896 --> 01:04:11.329
Check out these chicks.

01:04:11.397 --> 01:04:13.126
They're wearing
those new miniskirts.

01:04:13.199 --> 01:04:15.599
It's my idea.
It's good for tips.

01:04:15.668 --> 01:04:17.101
The customers always come back.

01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:18.610
Massapequa's changed.
Watch yourself.

01:04:18.671 --> 01:04:21.607
It's no mom and pop
operation anymore.

01:04:21.675 --> 01:04:23.142
This is our town.

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:27.112
You're doing a nice job.
Keep up the good work.

01:04:27.181 --> 01:04:28.273
Good.

01:04:28.349 --> 01:04:29.782
Copiague, Ronnie,
Jericho, Bayville,

01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.317
Valley Stream, man.

01:04:31.385 --> 01:04:32.819
I want to turn Boyer's

01:04:32.887 --> 01:04:35.287
into a whole Long Island thing.

01:04:35.357 --> 01:04:38.155
I want you to come
to work for me.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:39.659
What can I do?

01:04:39.728 --> 01:04:41.662
This is our town now.

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:44.666
You're a war hero,
and you can benefit.

01:04:44.734 --> 01:04:46.201
You should benefit, Ronnie.

01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:47.668
You mean, like partners?

01:04:47.737 --> 01:04:49.671
We open a place together?

01:04:49.739 --> 01:04:52.173
You got to walk before you run.

01:04:52.241 --> 01:04:55.176
I could start you out
as a cashier.

01:04:55.244 --> 01:04:57.713
Then you could
learn the business,

01:04:57.781 --> 01:05:00.113
work your way up to be manager,

01:05:00.183 --> 01:05:02.014
just like your dad.

01:05:02.085 --> 01:05:04.713
I get 1,700 a month
from the government.

01:05:04.788 --> 01:05:06.187
I'll take my time.

01:05:06.256 --> 01:05:08.487
That's charity money.
This isn't.

01:05:08.559 --> 01:05:09.457
Charity?

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:10.549
Here's your cola.

01:05:10.662 --> 01:05:13.426
You got to put
the war behind you.

01:05:13.531 --> 01:05:15.396
Forget about
this chair you're in.

01:05:15.466 --> 01:05:16.899
Sometimes, you know, Stevie,

01:05:16.968 --> 01:05:18.401
I think people know

01:05:18.469 --> 01:05:19.903
you're back from Vietnam,

01:05:19.972 --> 01:05:22.406
and their face changes,
the eyes...

01:05:22.474 --> 01:05:25.443
the voice, the way
they look at you.

01:05:25.511 --> 01:05:27.411
I know, but people here,

01:05:27.479 --> 01:05:29.913
they don't give a shit
about the war.

01:05:29.982 --> 01:05:32.884
It's just a million miles away.
It's all bullshit.

01:05:32.952 --> 01:05:35.853
The government sold us
a bill of goods.

01:05:35.922 --> 01:05:38.720
We got the shit
kicked out of us.

01:05:38.792 --> 01:05:42.353
What do you mean "we"?
You were in college.

01:05:43.464 --> 01:05:46.399
It was you who bought
that communist bullshit.

01:05:46.467 --> 01:05:49.402
Yeah. They were going
to take over the world.

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:50.903
Do you remember that?

01:05:50.971 --> 01:05:52.404
Finnelli, you, Walsh.

01:05:52.473 --> 01:05:54.407
The whole town was devastated.

01:05:54.475 --> 01:05:56.205
For what?

01:05:56.278 --> 01:05:57.404
For lies?

01:05:57.479 --> 01:05:59.572
For bullshit lies?

01:06:06.321 --> 01:06:07.789
They burn the flag.

01:06:07.857 --> 01:06:09.256
They demonstrate against us

01:06:09.325 --> 01:06:11.759
on the cover of the paper today.

01:06:11.828 --> 01:06:13.261
They have no respect.

01:06:13.329 --> 01:06:14.762
They have no idea

01:06:14.831 --> 01:06:16.731
what's going on over there

01:06:16.833 --> 01:06:19.064
and the men that are
sacrificing their lives.

01:06:19.169 --> 01:06:20.602
Nobody here seems to care.

01:06:20.671 --> 01:06:23.469
It's a bunch of goddamned shit.

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:27.340
Don't take the Lord's name in vain
in front of the children.

01:06:27.411 --> 01:06:29.641
I agree with everything you say.

01:06:29.713 --> 01:06:31.147
I served my country.

01:06:31.216 --> 01:06:33.650
They just want to take from it.

01:06:33.718 --> 01:06:35.652
Love it or leave it.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.119
The other side's angry

01:06:37.188 --> 01:06:38.621
because we're not winning.

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:40.157
How can we win?

01:06:40.225 --> 01:06:41.658
Tommy, what's the matter?

01:06:41.727 --> 01:06:42.625
Nothing.

01:06:42.695 --> 01:06:44.128
Anybody listening here?
Tommy?

01:06:44.196 --> 01:06:45.128
What?

01:06:45.197 --> 01:06:47.062
Tommy's going to fail English.

01:06:47.133 --> 01:06:49.624
He doesn't believe in the war.

01:06:50.669 --> 01:06:52.694
What?

01:06:52.805 --> 01:06:55.604
He thinks we're doing
the wrong thing

01:06:55.675 --> 01:06:56.607
over there.

01:06:56.676 --> 01:06:59.611
He thinks it's all a mistake.

01:06:59.679 --> 01:07:02.614
Mistake? What's this?
Spit it out.

01:07:02.682 --> 01:07:04.115
You believe in demonstrators?

01:07:04.184 --> 01:07:05.277
Huh? What?

01:07:05.353 --> 01:07:08.288
I just don't agree
with everything you're saying.

01:07:08.356 --> 01:07:10.290
I don't think you understand.

01:07:10.358 --> 01:07:12.292
What does Tommy know?

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.021
I don't understand?

01:07:14.095 --> 01:07:16.029
He's hanging around
with longhairs

01:07:16.097 --> 01:07:17.759
who take drugs!

01:07:17.833 --> 01:07:19.266
That's not the reason.

01:07:19.334 --> 01:07:20.494
Have they ever worked?

01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:22.833
You want to burn the flag?
Huh, Tommy?

01:07:22.938 --> 01:07:24.064
What is this?

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:26.664
You want to
bring down this country?

01:07:26.775 --> 01:07:29.142
Love it or leave it, Tommy.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:31.112
All they're
trying to say, Ronnie,

01:07:31.181 --> 01:07:33.649
is they don't want more people

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.513
to come back like you.

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:36.950
That's an easy excuse.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.285
Where were they when
their country needed them?

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:41.790
You served your country.

01:07:41.859 --> 01:07:44.794
What did you get out of it?

01:07:44.862 --> 01:07:46.659
Look at you.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:49.665
Well, look at me.

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:51.530
Look at you, man.

01:07:51.602 --> 01:07:54.697
I got to go. I'll see
you around, all right?

01:07:54.773 --> 01:07:56.764
What's wrong with me, Tommy?

01:07:56.842 --> 01:07:58.571
What's wrong with me?

01:07:58.677 --> 01:08:00.668
Is there something
wrong with me?

01:08:00.779 --> 01:08:02.178
I volunteered, Tommy!

01:08:02.247 --> 01:08:05.081
You don't know
what you're talking about!

01:08:05.151 --> 01:08:06.584
Were you there?

01:08:06.652 --> 01:08:10.110
You can just love it
or leave it, Tommy!

01:08:10.189 --> 01:08:11.588
Mom, I can't believe

01:08:11.657 --> 01:08:13.921
what Tommy just said to me.

01:08:13.993 --> 01:08:15.051
I can't...

01:08:15.127 --> 01:08:18.791
I can't believe
what Tommy just said to me.

01:08:24.738 --> 01:08:26.035
Parade time, Ronnie.

01:08:26.106 --> 01:08:29.702
You tell them I'll be
right there, all right?

01:08:31.145 --> 01:08:34.238
What kind of car is it?

01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:35.907
I think it's a Continental.

01:08:36.017 --> 01:08:37.075
Continental?

01:08:37.185 --> 01:08:38.209
A convertible?

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:39.252
Yeah.

01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:41.084
They said it would be.

01:08:41.156 --> 01:08:42.817

Die!

01:10:32.343 --> 01:10:36.439
Today is July the 4th,
and I believe in America.

01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:40.076
And I believe in Americanism.

01:10:41.353 --> 01:10:42.786
But most of all,

01:10:42.855 --> 01:10:45.415
I believe in victory
for America.

01:10:47.226 --> 01:10:50.458
Some people are starting
to say the war is wrong,

01:10:50.530 --> 01:10:52.293
That we shouldn't be there.

01:10:52.365 --> 01:10:55.334
Some people would like to
tear our country down.

01:10:55.402 --> 01:10:56.960
But who are the kids

01:10:57.037 --> 01:10:58.971
defending their right
to protest?

01:10:59.039 --> 01:11:00.942
These are the kids
who care about America,

01:11:01.042 --> 01:11:03.704
kids who have respect
for their flag

01:11:03.778 --> 01:11:06.042
and their parents
and their government

01:11:06.113 --> 01:11:08.547
and their religion.

01:11:08.616 --> 01:11:11.084
Kids like Joey Walsh.

01:11:11.152 --> 01:11:13.053
He was the first.

01:11:13.121 --> 01:11:15.885
We got a street
in the park named after him.

01:11:15.957 --> 01:11:17.254
And Danny Topinka,

01:11:17.325 --> 01:11:20.556
Billy Vorsovich,

01:11:20.629 --> 01:11:22.324
Phil and Larry Powell,

01:11:22.397 --> 01:11:24.025
Tommy Finnelli.

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:27.558
Six boys from Massapequa...

01:11:27.637 --> 01:11:29.070
and they all knew

01:11:29.138 --> 01:11:32.403
what honor, duty,
and sacrifice meant.

01:11:32.475 --> 01:11:34.568
They paid the highest price.

01:11:34.644 --> 01:11:36.613
They died for it.

01:11:38.148 --> 01:11:40.446
This town's been hit hard.

01:11:40.517 --> 01:11:42.576
It's always been hit hard.

01:11:42.686 --> 01:11:45.621
Doc here, he was
in the First War.

01:11:45.689 --> 01:11:48.750
A lot of us here
were in the Second.

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:50.919
That's why we can't give up.

01:11:51.029 --> 01:11:54.123
That's why we're going to
win in Vietnam.

01:11:56.301 --> 01:11:59.601
Because Massapequa's
been there before,

01:11:59.672 --> 01:12:02.766
because of those
six wonderful boys,

01:12:02.842 --> 01:12:05.743
and because of him.

01:12:05.811 --> 01:12:07.039
Ron...

01:12:07.113 --> 01:12:09.877
come say a few words,
would you, please?

01:12:09.949 --> 01:12:11.542
Ron Kovic, ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:11.618 --> 01:12:14.553
He was born
on the 4th of July, 1946.

01:12:14.621 --> 01:12:18.216
Give him a big hand
on his great birthday.

01:12:26.768 --> 01:12:29.896
I just want to say
for the guys in Vietnam

01:12:29.971 --> 01:12:31.370
that we're doing our best.

01:12:31.439 --> 01:12:34.238
It's not an easy situation,

01:12:34.309 --> 01:12:39.713
but the boys' morale
over there is real high,

01:12:39.782 --> 01:12:42.216
and you can feel
confident that we are...

01:12:42.284 --> 01:12:44.752
we are going to win that war.

01:12:50.693 --> 01:12:52.593
I served my country,

01:12:52.662 --> 01:12:56.098
and I don't want you
to feel sorry for me.

01:12:56.166 --> 01:12:58.101
Do not shed a tear.

01:12:58.169 --> 01:13:02.299
I have my hands,
my eyes, my ears...

01:13:02.373 --> 01:13:03.806
I have my heart...

01:13:05.676 --> 01:13:07.143
and I have...

01:13:07.211 --> 01:13:08.644
what I feel...

01:13:15.153 --> 01:13:17.519
I have what I feel is...

01:13:17.589 --> 01:13:19.750
an unquen... quenchable...

01:13:53.895 --> 01:13:55.328
O.K. It's O.K., Ronnie.

01:13:55.396 --> 01:13:56.989
It's O.K., kid.

01:13:59.702 --> 01:14:01.135
I'm sorry.

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:03.328
I'm sorry.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.374
And we'll continue to fight

01:14:09.446 --> 01:14:12.108
because of guys
like Ron Kovic...

01:14:13.984 --> 01:14:15.383
Dad, where's the car?

01:14:15.452 --> 01:14:16.885
It's across the street.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.386
Like he said,

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:19.821
we're going to win that war.

01:14:19.891 --> 01:14:21.153
Ronnie.

01:14:22.059 --> 01:14:23.583
Ronnie.

01:14:28.766 --> 01:14:29.994
Timmy?

01:14:31.436 --> 01:14:32.903
Timmy, man?

01:14:32.971 --> 01:14:34.029
Timmy!

01:14:34.139 --> 01:14:36.073
I heard you were...

01:14:36.141 --> 01:14:37.540
When did you get back?

01:14:37.609 --> 01:14:39.702
When did you get out?

01:14:43.283 --> 01:14:44.375
Wow, man.

01:14:48.388 --> 01:14:50.356
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:14:50.423 --> 01:14:51.321
Mr. Kovic?

01:14:51.391 --> 01:14:53.291
Yeah. Sure.

01:15:01.468 --> 01:15:03.959
Antiwar demonstrators have come
to Washington, D.C.

01:15:04.071 --> 01:15:05.971
To shut the city down.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.134
And Martin's Laugh In,

01:15:08.243 --> 01:15:11.269
starring Dan Rowan
and Dick Martin,

01:15:11.379 --> 01:15:14.314
with Sammy Davis, Jr.

01:15:14.382 --> 01:15:16.179
And Judy Carne...

01:15:16.251 --> 01:15:17.343
Honey.

01:15:17.419 --> 01:15:19.354
Come on.
It's starting.

01:15:19.422 --> 01:15:20.650
O.K. I'm coming.

01:15:20.723 --> 01:15:22.588
It's the one with Sammy Davis.

01:15:22.658 --> 01:15:23.750
Oh, yeah?

01:15:26.829 --> 01:15:28.626
Who else used to play?

01:15:28.698 --> 01:15:30.131
Come on, Ronnie.

01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:32.259
No. Come on.
Tell me who.

01:15:32.336 --> 01:15:33.428
Bobby Moore at shortstop.

01:15:33.503 --> 01:15:34.731
Grady Rogers at third.

01:15:34.805 --> 01:15:37.433
Grady got sick.
It was Finnelli at third.

01:15:37.541 --> 01:15:38.473
Tommy Finnelli.

01:15:38.542 --> 01:15:39.600
Yeah.

01:15:41.044 --> 01:15:44.503
Got hit with one
of his own mortars.

01:15:44.615 --> 01:15:46.173
That's crazy, man.

01:15:46.284 --> 01:15:48.718
Shit, I heard about that.

01:15:48.786 --> 01:15:51.414
Remember the twins,
Phil and Larry Powell?

01:15:51.489 --> 01:15:52.717
Oh, the twins. Oh.

01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:54.088
They were great wrestlers.

01:15:54.159 --> 01:15:56.923
Oh, man.
They were fucking great.

01:15:56.996 --> 01:15:57.894
Tough.

01:15:57.963 --> 01:15:58.895
Tough bastards.

01:15:58.964 --> 01:16:00.192
When Phil got killed,

01:16:00.265 --> 01:16:03.234
Larry... who wasn't much
for brains either...

01:16:03.302 --> 01:16:05.601
went down the next day
and joined up.

01:16:05.672 --> 01:16:06.604
Oh, God.

01:16:06.673 --> 01:16:07.901
Then he got hit.

01:16:07.974 --> 01:16:08.941
Oh, no.

01:16:09.009 --> 01:16:09.907
It's true.

01:16:10.010 --> 01:16:11.944
A land mine or something.

01:16:12.012 --> 01:16:15.448
He got hit in the head
with a tree.

01:16:15.515 --> 01:16:17.450
Yeah. I'm telling
you the truth.

01:16:17.518 --> 01:16:19.281
He goes over to Vietnam,

01:16:19.353 --> 01:16:22.447
and he gets killed
by a flying fucking tree.

01:16:22.523 --> 01:16:24.457
Oh.

01:16:24.525 --> 01:16:25.958
That's really fucking funny.

01:16:26.027 --> 01:16:29.464
I think the whole
town got devastated, Ronnie.

01:16:29.531 --> 01:16:33.490
I don't think
we got a friend left.

01:16:33.568 --> 01:16:35.126
It's really funny.

01:16:41.544 --> 01:16:44.138
When did you get hit, Timmy?

01:16:47.417 --> 01:16:48.975
September the 18th.

01:16:50.086 --> 01:16:51.849
Near Dong Ha.

01:16:53.924 --> 01:16:56.392
A lot of bad shit
up there, Ronnie,

01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:57.688
I'm telling you.

01:16:57.761 --> 01:17:00.025
Things I don't
even want to talk about.

01:17:00.097 --> 01:17:01.689
You know.

01:17:01.765 --> 01:17:04.029
I mean, uh...

01:17:04.101 --> 01:17:05.694
it was crazy.

01:17:06.938 --> 01:17:08.872
Shooting anything that...

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.534
anything that fucking moved,
you know?

01:17:15.647 --> 01:17:18.708
When did you...
When did you get hit?

01:17:18.818 --> 01:17:19.750
Me?

01:17:19.819 --> 01:17:21.252
Well...

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.050
Uh, January 20th.
Yes.

01:17:24.123 --> 01:17:26.717
Someplace off... I don't
even remember.

01:17:26.792 --> 01:17:28.192
Up in the DMZ.

01:17:28.261 --> 01:17:30.559
Walked into
a whole battalion of them.

01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:32.359
Got shot in the foot.

01:17:32.432 --> 01:17:34.730
I got up like I was...

01:17:34.801 --> 01:17:36.564
back in the woods again,

01:17:36.636 --> 01:17:38.536
like I was John fucking Wayne,

01:17:38.605 --> 01:17:41.404
emptying a mag, screaming,
"Come on, Charlie, motherfucker!

01:17:41.476 --> 01:17:43.410
Come on out,
Charlie, motherfucker!"

01:17:43.478 --> 01:17:45.036
Rat-tat-tat-tat.

01:17:46.114 --> 01:17:48.878
I heard this crack
above my right ear,

01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:51.385
and I just felt my body...

01:17:51.487 --> 01:17:54.718
drop out from under me.

01:17:54.823 --> 01:17:58.122
Well, I thought
I was dead for sure.

01:17:58.193 --> 01:17:59.592
Was the, uh...

01:17:59.661 --> 01:18:01.128
How was the hospital?

01:18:01.196 --> 01:18:02.094
It sucked.

01:18:02.164 --> 01:18:03.097
I know.

01:18:03.166 --> 01:18:04.098
Really bad.

01:18:04.167 --> 01:18:06.260
I'll tell you
something, Ronnie...

01:18:06.336 --> 01:18:08.600
Sometimes at night...

01:18:08.671 --> 01:18:11.469
I get these headaches, you know?

01:18:11.541 --> 01:18:13.476
They're bad.

01:18:13.576 --> 01:18:14.338
And, uh...

01:18:14.410 --> 01:18:16.242
they just kind of come over me,

01:18:16.313 --> 01:18:19.578
and these doctors
don't know shit, you know.

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:23.177
They just come,
like I'm going crazy or something.

01:18:24.622 --> 01:18:29.060
I don't feel... I don't feel
like me anymore, you know?

01:18:29.127 --> 01:18:31.061
I feel like...
when they come,

01:18:31.129 --> 01:18:33.063
I feel like somebody else.

01:18:33.131 --> 01:18:34.564
What do you do?

01:18:34.633 --> 01:18:37.568
Nothing. Not a goddamned
thing, you know?

01:18:37.636 --> 01:18:41.733
Well... mostly I do
a lot of drugs.

01:18:43.809 --> 01:18:46.107
Do anything you can, you know?

01:18:46.179 --> 01:18:49.774
Y-You get through it
any way you can.

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:52.080
When I was in the hospital,

01:18:52.152 --> 01:18:55.246
I thought, "Yeah.
Yeah, this makes sense."

01:18:56.323 --> 01:18:58.086
What makes sense?

01:18:58.158 --> 01:19:00.786
'Cause I failed, Timmy.

01:19:00.894 --> 01:19:02.920
What are you talking about?

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.634
'Cause I...

01:19:07.702 --> 01:19:10.637
'Cause I killed someone...
some people. I...

01:19:10.705 --> 01:19:13.732
I made some terrible...

01:19:13.809 --> 01:19:14.867
mistakes.

01:19:14.944 --> 01:19:18.402
Ronnie, we all made mistakes.
I mean, you...

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:19.640
you had no choice.

01:19:19.715 --> 01:19:21.148
Those damn pansy demonstrators

01:19:21.217 --> 01:19:23.185
will never understand.

01:19:23.252 --> 01:19:24.583
Don't talk about it.

01:19:24.653 --> 01:19:26.622
It was insane over there.

01:19:26.690 --> 01:19:29.250
Sometimes I wish...
I wish I'd...

01:19:30.327 --> 01:19:32.591
When I got shot in the foot,

01:19:32.662 --> 01:19:34.425
I could have laid down.

01:19:34.531 --> 01:19:37.968
Who gives a fuck now
if I was a hero or not?

01:19:38.069 --> 01:19:40.469
I was paralyzed,
castrated that day. Why?

01:19:40.538 --> 01:19:43.666
'Cause I was so s...
stupid.

01:19:43.741 --> 01:19:47.734
I have my dick and my balls now
and I think...

01:19:49.514 --> 01:19:53.348
I think, Timmy,
I'd give everything I believe in,

01:19:53.418 --> 01:19:55.545
everything I got...
all my values

01:19:55.621 --> 01:19:57.521
just to have my body again,

01:19:57.589 --> 01:19:59.557
just to be whole again.

01:19:59.625 --> 01:20:01.025
But I'm not whole.

01:20:01.094 --> 01:20:03.358
I never will be, and that's...

01:20:03.429 --> 01:20:06.193
the way it is, isn't it?

01:20:07.934 --> 01:20:08.992
Ronnie...

01:20:09.102 --> 01:20:10.569
it's your birthday.

01:20:10.637 --> 01:20:12.970
You're alive.

01:20:15.743 --> 01:20:17.301
You made it.

01:20:18.279 --> 01:20:20.076
Smile.

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:32.760

Those long letters I wrote you

01:22:05.828 --> 01:22:07.227
from over there?

01:22:07.296 --> 01:22:08.729
Crazy stuff, huh?

01:22:08.798 --> 01:22:10.232
That's all right.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:11.597
I had to say everything

01:22:11.668 --> 01:22:14.603
I couldn't say
when we were growing up.

01:22:14.671 --> 01:22:16.229
They were beautiful letters.

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:17.238
Yeah?

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:18.740
Yeah.

01:22:18.809 --> 01:22:21.779
I wasn't too sure
about the spelling in them.

01:22:21.846 --> 01:22:24.610
Who cares if you can spell?

01:22:24.716 --> 01:22:26.843
There was...

01:22:26.951 --> 01:22:30.546
There was a lot of feeling
in the words.

01:22:32.457 --> 01:22:35.985
I'm so sorry for what happened
to you, Ronnie.

01:22:36.061 --> 01:22:40.521
My mom called me
at school and told me.

01:22:40.599 --> 01:22:42.590
I was just so shocked.

01:22:43.502 --> 01:22:46.063
I... I wanted to...

01:22:46.139 --> 01:22:48.266
reach out and help you.

01:22:50.277 --> 01:22:51.767
But...

01:22:51.845 --> 01:22:53.608
it was just so frustrating,

01:22:53.713 --> 01:22:54.771
I just...

01:22:54.881 --> 01:22:58.841
stood in the hallway
of my dorm room shaking.

01:22:58.953 --> 01:23:01.046
I couldn't say anything.

01:23:02.023 --> 01:23:03.149
Donna...

01:23:03.224 --> 01:23:05.852
uh, they need you
over at Locklin.

01:23:05.927 --> 01:23:08.088
I can't right now,
Jeff. Later.

01:23:08.162 --> 01:23:10.324
Well, don't forget
about the meeting.

01:23:10.399 --> 01:23:11.491
Yeah, 9:00?

01:23:11.567 --> 01:23:13.159
Yeah. Thanks.

01:23:14.436 --> 01:23:15.368
I'm sorry.

01:23:15.437 --> 01:23:16.802
You're real busy, huh?

01:23:16.872 --> 01:23:19.500
We've got this Kent State
demonstration tomorrow.

01:23:19.575 --> 01:23:21.168
I'm on the organizing committee.

01:23:21.244 --> 01:23:23.508
Kent State.
I heard about that.

01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:25.047
It was... Jesus...
terrible.

01:23:25.114 --> 01:23:26.081
It's terrible.

01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:28.447
When I saw that girl

01:23:28.551 --> 01:23:31.520
lying in that pool of blood
at Kent State,

01:23:31.588 --> 01:23:33.989
I kept on thinking
of that poster

01:23:34.058 --> 01:23:36.754
of the children
that were killed at My Lai.

01:23:36.827 --> 01:23:40.285
And I kept on thinking
about you over there...

01:23:40.364 --> 01:23:42.764
and all the boys who've died,

01:23:42.833 --> 01:23:47.703
who've sacrificed
their bodies and...

01:23:47.772 --> 01:23:49.330
and their minds.

01:23:50.408 --> 01:23:52.376
The war is so wrong, Ronnie.

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:53.812
It's so wrong.

01:23:53.912 --> 01:23:56.074
I just had to do something.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:03.517
♪ We don't need arms ♪

01:24:03.623 --> 01:24:08.152
♪ We need hands to hold ♪

01:24:09.496 --> 01:24:14.160
♪ And we
don't need bombs... # ♪

Strike now, shut it down!

01:24:19.641 --> 01:24:21.575
Strike now, shut it down!

01:24:21.643 --> 01:24:24.908
You know, Ronnie,
I'm not saying that you are,

01:24:24.979 --> 01:24:28.210
but if you have any feelings
against the war,

01:24:28.283 --> 01:24:30.684
you could really help.

01:24:30.753 --> 01:24:32.687
I mean, you've been there.

01:24:32.755 --> 01:24:34.347
You know what it's like.

01:24:34.423 --> 01:24:36.687
You could tell people
what's happening,

01:24:36.792 --> 01:24:39.352
and they'd really listen to you.

01:24:42.332 --> 01:24:43.890

Boy, was I crazy that night.

01:24:57.915 --> 01:25:01.749
I just had to dance with you
before I went in.

01:25:01.819 --> 01:25:04.014
It was like I knew.

01:25:04.088 --> 01:25:08.116
I made a promise to myself
that I would come back

01:25:08.193 --> 01:25:09.922
and love you forever.

01:25:10.028 --> 01:25:11.689
Donna.
Hey, Donna.

01:25:11.797 --> 01:25:12.729
Yeah?

01:25:12.798 --> 01:25:14.925
The Reverend
can't make it tomorrow.

01:25:15.033 --> 01:25:15.965
What?

01:25:16.034 --> 01:25:17.296
He can't make it.

01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:18.302
Oh.

01:25:18.371 --> 01:25:20.805
What can we do?
Who can we get?

01:25:20.873 --> 01:25:23.637
Just let me think.
I'll see you later.

01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:24.642
Better hurry.

01:25:24.711 --> 01:25:26.235
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:25:27.647 --> 01:25:30.708
Ronnie, I got to...
I got to go inside.

01:25:30.784 --> 01:25:32.843
Do you want to come?

01:25:35.489 --> 01:25:36.979
No, I don't think so.

01:25:37.057 --> 01:25:38.115
O.K.

01:25:39.727 --> 01:25:40.854
O.K.

01:25:42.931 --> 01:25:44.125
Maybe I'll hang around.

01:25:44.232 --> 01:25:45.961
Maybe we'll talk later.

01:25:47.736 --> 01:25:50.296
All right.
I'll see you later.

01:26:08.525 --> 01:26:10.152
1, 2, 3, 4!

01:26:10.227 --> 01:26:11.854
We don't want your fucking war!

01:26:11.928 --> 01:26:14.829
1, 2, 3, 4! We don't want

01:26:14.898 --> 01:26:18.164

01:26:18.269 --> 01:26:19.964
All right! Wow!

01:26:20.071 --> 01:26:24.599
It's great to be at free
Syracuse University!

01:26:27.913 --> 01:26:31.314
We're really getting
an education now, aren't we?

01:26:32.651 --> 01:26:34.346
Right on, man!
Right on!

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.819
Right freaking on!

01:26:35.888 --> 01:26:38.152
Yesterday I was at
Brooklyn College...

01:26:38.223 --> 01:26:40.886
NYU... they were both
closed down!

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.588
Over 200 high schools
are closed down.

01:26:43.663 --> 01:26:45.995
Over 400 universities
are closed down.

01:26:46.066 --> 01:26:49.229
It'll be twice that number
by the time...

01:26:51.037 --> 01:26:54.303
This is an unlawful assembly.

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:57.606
If you do not disperse...

01:26:57.678 --> 01:27:00.306
The people that killed
the kids at Kent State

01:27:00.381 --> 01:27:02.815
have names like
General Waste-more-land!

01:27:04.486 --> 01:27:07.717
Spiro Agnew!

01:27:07.789 --> 01:27:11.350
Tricky Dicky Nixon!

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:15.591
Wait for the command.

01:27:15.665 --> 01:27:17.656
And then we go to Washington,

01:27:17.734 --> 01:27:21.295
confront the war makers
in their own house!

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:22.667
On to Washington!

01:27:22.739 --> 01:27:24.832
On to the White House!

01:27:31.014 --> 01:27:34.177
I loved this country once.

01:27:34.284 --> 01:27:36.252
And all this I won over there.

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:37.719
Check it out...

01:27:37.788 --> 01:27:41.486
Purple Heart, Bronze Star,

01:27:41.559 --> 01:27:43.026
all the commendation medals,

01:27:43.094 --> 01:27:45.528
all the rest of that garbage.

01:27:45.597 --> 01:27:46.996
It don't mean a thing.

01:27:47.065 --> 01:27:48.828

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:50.698

01:27:54.006 --> 01:27:55.371
This is war!

01:27:55.441 --> 01:27:57.375
I said this is war!

01:27:57.476 --> 01:28:00.809
They just killed two brothers
at Jackson State!

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.849
Stand by to gas!

01:28:08.321 --> 01:28:10.186
Take them down!

01:28:21.002 --> 01:28:23.470

01:32:47.524 --> 01:32:49.754
I've got a lifetime
of practice, Jenny.

01:32:49.827 --> 01:32:53.228

01:32:53.297 --> 01:32:55.391

01:33:02.941 --> 01:33:04.374
You O.K.?
You all right?

01:33:04.442 --> 01:33:05.875
I don't mean to laugh.

01:33:05.944 --> 01:33:07.378
Shut up, Jenny.

01:33:07.446 --> 01:33:09.710
Look at him.
He's fucking shitfaced!

01:33:09.782 --> 01:33:10.749
Ronnie?

01:33:10.816 --> 01:33:12.716
Ron?

01:33:12.785 --> 01:33:14.309
Ronnie?

01:33:15.721 --> 01:33:17.188
Give him some room.

01:33:17.256 --> 01:33:18.655
Get him out of here.

01:33:18.724 --> 01:33:20.158
Give me my chair.

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:21.660
Give me my chair.

01:33:21.728 --> 01:33:23.662
I just want to dance.

01:33:23.730 --> 01:33:25.664
I just want to dance.

01:33:25.732 --> 01:33:27.825
Give me my chair.

01:33:27.901 --> 01:33:29.493
Jenny!

01:33:29.569 --> 01:33:30.730
Jenny!

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:38.503
I got it.
I got it.

01:33:42.316 --> 01:33:43.682
Come on, come on.

01:33:43.752 --> 01:33:46.346
Hey, Steve,
let's go. Come on.

01:33:53.529 --> 01:33:55.464
Come on.
Steve, come on.

01:33:55.532 --> 01:33:56.282
Let's go.

01:34:02.906 --> 01:34:04.339
What's going on?

01:34:04.407 --> 01:34:05.806
Are you drunk again?

01:34:05.876 --> 01:34:06.808
Hey, Mom.

01:34:06.877 --> 01:34:08.344
He's drunk again.

01:34:08.412 --> 01:34:10.312
Eli, we have a drunk for a son.

01:34:10.381 --> 01:34:11.848
You leave that alone.

01:34:11.916 --> 01:34:13.816
You can't stay in this house.

01:34:13.884 --> 01:34:16.352
This is what you believe in,

01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:17.820
but I don't.

01:34:17.889 --> 01:34:19.823
I don't believe in him anymore.

01:34:19.891 --> 01:34:21.825
I'll take care of him.

01:34:21.893 --> 01:34:24.828
I wish I were dead like him.

01:34:24.896 --> 01:34:26.830
You don't know
what you're saying.

01:34:26.898 --> 01:34:28.365
That's the problem.
I'm not dead.

01:34:28.466 --> 01:34:29.900
I got to live.

01:34:29.969 --> 01:34:31.698
I got to roll around

01:34:31.804 --> 01:34:33.931
and remind them of Vietnam.

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.974
You don't want to see us.

01:34:36.042 --> 01:34:37.509
You want to hide us

01:34:37.577 --> 01:34:39.841
'cause it is a can of shit!

01:34:39.912 --> 01:34:41.380
And I am a fucking dummy!

01:34:41.448 --> 01:34:43.382
He won't listen.
He won't change.

01:34:43.450 --> 01:34:44.849
Take your mom seriously.

01:34:44.918 --> 01:34:46.852
You can't drink in this house.

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.888
I believed everything
they told us.

01:34:48.956 --> 01:34:51.151
Go fight! Go kill!

01:34:51.225 --> 01:34:52.692
Sergeant man, Marine Corps!

01:34:52.759 --> 01:34:54.523
Yo, squad!
Left, squad!

01:34:54.596 --> 01:34:55.961
Right, squad, left!

01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:57.463
And it's all a lie.

01:34:57.532 --> 01:35:01.298
The whole thing
is a bunch of lies!

01:35:01.369 --> 01:35:03.234
Stop it! Go to bed!

01:35:03.338 --> 01:35:06.638
What did they do to you
in that war?

01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:08.574
You need help, Ronnie.

01:35:08.644 --> 01:35:10.271
No, you need help,

01:35:10.346 --> 01:35:11.779
with all your God

01:35:11.847 --> 01:35:13.815
and your bullshit dreams
about me!

01:35:13.882 --> 01:35:15.713
You are ashamed of me!

01:35:15.784 --> 01:35:20.154
Go to sleep.
You go to bed.

01:35:20.223 --> 01:35:21.815
Fuck you!

01:35:21.891 --> 01:35:24.325
What did you say to me?

01:35:24.394 --> 01:35:25.986
What...

01:35:26.062 --> 01:35:27.290
Mom!

01:35:28.466 --> 01:35:29.558
Fuck you!

01:35:29.634 --> 01:35:31.124
You'll wake
the whole neighborhood.

01:35:31.202 --> 01:35:32.726
Wake them up!
Tell them!

01:35:32.803 --> 01:35:37.103
Cusacks! Camelettis!
Walshes!

01:35:37.208 --> 01:35:40.144
You tell them all
what they did to me,

01:35:40.212 --> 01:35:43.181
what they did to this whole block,
this whole country.

01:35:43.248 --> 01:35:44.715
They'll call the police.

01:35:44.816 --> 01:35:46.716
We went to Vietnam
to stop communism.

01:35:46.785 --> 01:35:48.946
We shot women and children.

01:35:49.021 --> 01:35:51.489
You didn't shoot
women and children.

01:35:51.557 --> 01:35:52.956
The church blessed the war.

01:35:53.026 --> 01:35:54.459
Communism, the insidious evil.

01:35:54.527 --> 01:35:57.087
They...
They told us to go.

01:35:57.163 --> 01:35:58.755
Yes, that's what they told us.

01:35:58.831 --> 01:36:00.662
Thou shall not kill, Mom.

01:36:00.733 --> 01:36:03.669
Thou shall not kill
women and children.

01:36:03.737 --> 01:36:05.671
Thou shall not kill, remember?

01:36:05.739 --> 01:36:08.207
Isn't that what you taught us?

01:36:08.309 --> 01:36:09.207
Stop it.

01:36:09.310 --> 01:36:10.937
Stop it!

01:36:11.045 --> 01:36:11.977
Stop it!

01:36:12.046 --> 01:36:14.480
I don't want you in this house.

01:36:14.548 --> 01:36:15.948
You're out of this house.

01:36:16.017 --> 01:36:17.951
Ron, you made your point.

01:36:18.019 --> 01:36:20.487
No! I haven't
made my point.

01:36:20.555 --> 01:36:21.954
You tell her, Dad.

01:36:22.023 --> 01:36:23.718
They're killing everyone now!

01:36:23.792 --> 01:36:25.259
I didn't force you to go!

01:36:25.327 --> 01:36:26.795
Yes, you did!

01:36:26.862 --> 01:36:28.762
And it's all falling apart!

01:36:28.831 --> 01:36:31.629
King, Kennedy, Kent State!

01:36:31.701 --> 01:36:33.669
We all lost the fucking war!

01:36:33.736 --> 01:36:35.135
It's not my fault!

01:36:35.204 --> 01:36:37.138
Communism won.
It's all for nothing.

01:36:37.206 --> 01:36:38.468
That's not true, Ronnie.

01:36:38.542 --> 01:36:40.908
How do you know?
What do you know?

01:36:40.977 --> 01:36:41.875
Ron.

01:36:41.945 --> 01:36:45.403
Will you...
You tell her, Dad!

01:36:45.515 --> 01:36:49.849
Tell her it's a lie!
It's a fucking lie!

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.354
There's no God!

01:36:51.422 --> 01:36:53.356
God is as dead as my legs!

01:36:53.424 --> 01:36:55.858
There's no God!
There's no country!

01:36:55.927 --> 01:36:56.859
It's nothing.

01:36:56.928 --> 01:36:59.761
It's just me
and this fucking wheelchair

01:36:59.831 --> 01:37:02.426
for the rest of my life
for nothing.

01:37:02.501 --> 01:37:04.128
Me and this... this...

01:37:04.203 --> 01:37:05.670
this dead penis, Mom.

01:37:05.738 --> 01:37:07.365
Oh, God! Ronnie!

01:37:07.439 --> 01:37:08.906
No, not with the catheter.

01:37:08.974 --> 01:37:10.373
For God's sake...
Penis!

01:37:10.442 --> 01:37:13.411
Eli, I can't stand it anymore.

01:37:13.479 --> 01:37:14.913
To hell with you.

01:37:14.981 --> 01:37:17.040
In church they say it's a sin

01:37:17.150 --> 01:37:18.447
if you play with your penis.

01:37:18.551 --> 01:37:20.109
I just wish I could.

01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:22.984
Don't say penis in this house!

01:37:23.056 --> 01:37:23.954
Penis!

01:37:24.023 --> 01:37:25.012
Stop!

01:37:25.125 --> 01:37:26.388
Penis!

01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:27.984
Big fucking erect penis, Mom!

01:37:28.062 --> 01:37:30.223
Stop!
Penis! Penis!

01:37:30.297 --> 01:37:32.731
He won't let go!
What can I do?

01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.200
I never even got time
to learn how to use it.

01:37:35.269 --> 01:37:38.239
It's gone in some
jungle in Asia.

01:37:38.306 --> 01:37:40.638
Just gone for...

01:37:45.647 --> 01:37:49.049
I'm sorry it happened this way.

01:37:50.853 --> 01:37:53.117
I'm sorry you're sad, Mom.

01:37:53.222 --> 01:37:56.988
I'm so sorry
you're sa-sad.

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:17.171
I'm so fucked up.

01:38:17.248 --> 01:38:18.909
Fucked up.

01:38:26.091 --> 01:38:27.422
Ronnie...

01:38:29.161 --> 01:38:32.130
maybe a little trip
is all you need.

01:38:32.198 --> 01:38:33.631
That place down in Mexico

01:38:33.699 --> 01:38:35.132
you were talking about.

01:38:35.201 --> 01:38:37.102
I don't want to go to Mexico.

01:38:37.170 --> 01:38:40.105
I don't want to go no place.

01:38:40.173 --> 01:38:43.267
I don't want to go no place.

01:38:46.179 --> 01:38:47.271
Ronnie...

01:38:48.883 --> 01:38:51.249
I think you should go.

01:38:53.521 --> 01:38:55.455
What can I do, Ronnie?

01:38:55.556 --> 01:38:57.114
What do you want?

01:39:00.028 --> 01:39:03.054
I want to be a man again.

01:39:05.501 --> 01:39:07.867
Who's going to love me, Dad?

01:39:07.936 --> 01:39:10.530
Who's ever going to love me?

01:39:14.043 --> 01:39:16.910
Who's going to love me?

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:02.294
Hey, you maggots,
ante up 5 American.

01:40:02.362 --> 01:40:03.761
Let's go. Ante up.

01:40:03.864 --> 01:40:05.491
Ed, you're light.

01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:07.590
The game
is seven-card stud,

01:40:07.701 --> 01:40:09.134
one up, two down.

01:40:09.202 --> 01:40:12.172
One up, two down.
We got a 5, a jack.

01:40:12.273 --> 01:40:14.241
That's a fucking joker, a king.

01:40:14.309 --> 01:40:17.801
The price of poker
just went up, gentlemen.

01:40:17.879 --> 01:40:19.005
Charlie buys a queen.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:21.139
Charlie, puppy.

01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:22.683
Two down, two down.

01:40:25.921 --> 01:40:28.412
Hey, big blue eyes,
what's your name?

01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:29.457
What's that?

01:40:29.525 --> 01:40:30.924
What's your name?

01:40:30.993 --> 01:40:31.925
Ron Kovic.

01:40:31.994 --> 01:40:33.656
Just what we need.
Another limp dick.

01:40:33.730 --> 01:40:34.697
Where from?

01:40:34.764 --> 01:40:36.629
Massapequa, Long Island.

01:40:36.733 --> 01:40:38.667
Guys, say hello to Ron Kovic.

01:40:38.735 --> 01:40:40.168
Just in from the States.

01:40:40.236 --> 01:40:41.760
Hi, Ron.

01:40:41.871 --> 01:40:43.805
Laugh, motherfucker.
You'll get yours.

01:40:43.873 --> 01:40:46.502
Fuck you.

01:40:46.577 --> 01:40:49.011
Put your hand right there, baby.

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:51.071
What's your name?

01:40:51.148 --> 01:40:53.139
Charlie, from Chicago.

01:40:53.217 --> 01:40:55.845
How long has this game
been going on?

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:57.218
55 hours.

01:40:57.289 --> 01:40:59.257
How long have you been here?

01:40:59.324 --> 01:41:00.689
A hundred fucking years.

01:41:00.759 --> 01:41:03.193
'Cause I got a gun.

01:41:03.261 --> 01:41:05.991
I ain't ever going back.
Fuck the States.

01:41:06.064 --> 01:41:07.691
Nobody understood.

01:41:07.766 --> 01:41:09.758
Nobody gave a shit.

01:41:09.869 --> 01:41:11.166
The fucking women

01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:13.295
didn't even want to look at me.

01:41:13.406 --> 01:41:14.304
Fucking States.

01:41:14.374 --> 01:41:17.172
I ain't never going back.

01:41:17.243 --> 01:41:19.006
I want something simple.

01:41:19.979 --> 01:41:21.971
Oh, baby, you're so beautiful.

01:41:22.049 --> 01:41:23.414
Ain't she beautiful?

01:41:23.484 --> 01:41:24.451
Here we go.

01:41:24.518 --> 01:41:26.816
She's beautiful.

01:41:26.887 --> 01:41:28.821
Go into town.
Get yourself one.

01:41:28.889 --> 01:41:32.382
Fuck the shit out of you,
even if you are paralyzed.

01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:34.291
Ain't that right, Martha?

01:41:34.362 --> 01:41:37.058
You know what they say:
If you ain't got it in the hips,

01:41:37.132 --> 01:41:40.693
you better have it in the lips.

01:41:40.769 --> 01:41:43.533
Don't stay here, man.

01:41:43.638 --> 01:41:45.197
Get the fuck out.

01:41:46.575 --> 01:41:50.534
You know, you're really drunk
on this Mescal shit...

01:41:52.014 --> 01:41:53.914
when you swallow the worm

01:41:53.983 --> 01:41:56.953
and don't even know you did it.

01:41:57.020 --> 01:41:59.853
Last round of betting.
Let's go, maggots.

01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:12.634
Are you from Villa Rosa?

01:43:12.735 --> 01:43:14.669
Yeah, yeah.

01:43:14.737 --> 01:43:15.726
Yeah.

01:43:15.838 --> 01:43:17.066
Bueno.

01:43:17.173 --> 01:43:18.937
We go?

01:43:19.009 --> 01:43:20.033
What's that?

01:43:20.878 --> 01:43:23.176
Do you want to go upstairs?

01:43:23.247 --> 01:43:26.375
No. No, I'm just
looking around.

01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:28.543
I just came in... Yeah!

01:43:28.619 --> 01:43:30.485
I'd like to go upstairs.

01:43:30.555 --> 01:43:32.113
I'd like to.

01:43:33.491 --> 01:43:35.425
Good.
Then come.

01:43:36.528 --> 01:43:38.018
Let's do it.

01:43:45.805 --> 01:43:47.295
What's your name?

01:43:47.373 --> 01:43:48.305
Maria Elena.

01:43:48.374 --> 01:43:49.272
Maria Elena?

01:43:49.341 --> 01:43:50.899
Hmm, si.

01:44:00.220 --> 01:44:01.619
The money...

01:44:01.688 --> 01:44:05.125
Sorry, I don't know how much...

01:44:07.695 --> 01:44:09.788
This... This is good.

01:44:11.699 --> 01:44:13.860
Why don't you take them off?

01:44:13.935 --> 01:44:15.129
No, I can't.

01:44:15.203 --> 01:44:16.637
I can't feel anything.

01:44:16.705 --> 01:44:19.538
I was paralyzed in the war.

01:44:19.641 --> 01:44:21.131
Vietnam?

01:44:21.243 --> 01:44:23.973
Yes.

01:44:24.079 --> 01:44:26.013
You let me see?

01:44:26.081 --> 01:44:27.139
No.

01:44:27.249 --> 01:44:28.045
Doesn't move.

01:44:28.116 --> 01:44:29.049
I can't.

01:44:29.118 --> 01:44:30.016
Oh, yes.

01:44:30.086 --> 01:44:31.053
It's no good.

01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.519
Yes, let me see.

01:44:32.589 --> 01:44:34.580
No. Look, please...

01:44:34.657 --> 01:44:36.488
the spine was severed.

01:44:36.559 --> 01:44:38.993
I have no movement, no feeling.

01:44:39.062 --> 01:44:41.031
There's nothing
down here at all.

01:44:41.098 --> 01:44:42.030
Nothing happens.

01:44:42.099 --> 01:44:43.123
O.K.

01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.360
O.K.

01:44:44.435 --> 01:44:45.697
O.K.

01:44:45.769 --> 01:44:49.170
We're going to have a good time.

01:44:52.944 --> 01:44:55.003
It's going to be O.K.

01:45:20.741 --> 01:45:23.505
You like?
Yes.

01:46:32.518 --> 01:46:35.612
Hey, man, Kovic.
How was it?

01:46:35.722 --> 01:46:36.950
How was it?

01:46:37.056 --> 01:46:40.493
♪ Ai yi yi yi # ♪

01:46:40.594 --> 01:46:42.528
Did you get one?
Did you get two?

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:44.154
Look out!

01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:45.664
Banzai, motherfucker!

01:46:53.241 --> 01:46:55.334
She loves you, right, tiger?

01:46:56.578 --> 01:46:59.172
Thanks a lot.
It was great.

01:46:59.247 --> 01:47:02.183
Just remember,
keep one hand on her tits

01:47:02.251 --> 01:47:03.843
and the other hand
on your wallet.

01:47:09.058 --> 01:47:11.049
Paradise!
Right, man?

01:47:14.631 --> 01:47:15.723
Whoo!

01:47:52.038 --> 01:47:53.630
Can I see this?

01:48:07.888 --> 01:48:10.857
I'll rip your fucking eye out
and skull-fuck you, motherfucker.

01:48:10.925 --> 01:48:13.622
You ever been skull-fucked?
You ever been skull-fucked?

01:48:13.728 --> 01:48:17.289
Yeah, I'll do it, man.
I'll do it, motherfucker.

01:48:17.399 --> 01:48:19.697
It don't mean a fucking thing.

01:48:21.803 --> 01:48:23.203
I'll be here tomorrow.

01:48:23.272 --> 01:48:26.730
You couldn't keep me away
with a baseball bat.

01:48:26.809 --> 01:48:28.743
I'll be here for sure.

01:48:31.647 --> 01:48:32.705
Vietnam.

01:48:48.433 --> 01:48:50.060
So...

01:48:50.168 --> 01:48:52.136
we get married today, no?

01:48:52.203 --> 01:48:55.138
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That would be great.

01:48:55.206 --> 01:48:56.400
Yeah.

01:49:13.894 --> 01:49:15.293
Hi.

01:49:17.197 --> 01:49:20.428
Want to fuck me? Huh?

01:49:22.069 --> 01:49:24.264
I'll give you a blow job.

01:49:31.078 --> 01:49:33.980
Hey, mister, you want me?

01:49:34.049 --> 01:49:35.880
60 pesos.

01:49:40.055 --> 01:49:41.317
Let's go.

01:50:08.452 --> 01:50:10.944
Aah!

01:50:49.364 --> 01:50:51.628
"Dear Mr.
And Mrs. Wilson...

01:50:53.034 --> 01:50:56.994
"I don't... I don't know
how to tell you this.

01:50:57.072 --> 01:51:00.132
"I knew your son in Vietnam.

01:51:03.112 --> 01:51:04.739
He was, uh..."

01:51:07.516 --> 01:51:09.951
I'm going to kill that fucking guy.

01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:12.955
I got him once.
I'll kill him now.

01:51:13.023 --> 01:51:14.490
You'll see.

01:51:14.557 --> 01:51:16.684
I'm serious.

01:51:20.464 --> 01:51:22.659
Your body.

01:51:22.733 --> 01:51:25.497
I'm just going
to fucking kill him.

01:51:25.569 --> 01:51:27.298
Imas!

01:51:27.371 --> 01:51:29.669
I'll fucking kill you!

01:51:29.774 --> 01:51:31.208
I'll kill you, bitch!

01:51:31.276 --> 01:51:34.370
You can't talk to me like that!

01:51:34.479 --> 01:51:36.447
Hey! Charlie!

01:51:36.548 --> 01:51:38.846
Get out! Get out!

01:51:38.917 --> 01:51:42.717
The bitch thinks it's funny
I can't move my dick!

01:51:42.788 --> 01:51:44.279
Fuck her.

01:51:44.357 --> 01:51:46.848
I'll kill you, bitch!

01:51:48.961 --> 01:51:51.759
Fuck all you
Mexican motherfuckers!

01:51:51.831 --> 01:51:53.264
Imaricon!

01:51:53.333 --> 01:51:55.029
You don't like it, get out!

01:51:55.102 --> 01:51:56.933
Fuck you!

01:51:57.004 --> 01:51:59.598
Hey!
Don't touch my friend.

01:51:59.673 --> 01:52:01.607
Don't you touch me!

01:52:01.709 --> 01:52:03.176
Get the hell out!

01:52:03.243 --> 01:52:05.370
Don't come back no more.

01:52:05.479 --> 01:52:08.449
I wouldn't be here if
it weren't for that fucking war!

01:52:08.516 --> 01:52:11.485
Fuck you!
Fuck all of you!

01:52:11.553 --> 01:52:14.784
You sure you told him
the right place, man?

01:52:14.856 --> 01:52:17.347
I told him fucking Villa Rosa!

01:52:17.425 --> 01:52:18.358
Villa Rosa?

01:52:18.427 --> 01:52:19.359
Villa Rosa!

01:52:19.428 --> 01:52:20.861
Villa Rosa, señor, Villa Rosa.

01:52:20.930 --> 01:52:21.828
Beautiful place.

01:52:21.897 --> 01:52:24.559
Great whorehouse there, man.

01:52:24.633 --> 01:52:25.759
Wait until we get there.

01:52:25.835 --> 01:52:28.599
Beautiful women with big tits,
small tits...

01:52:28.671 --> 01:52:32.802
That goddamned slut.
That Mexican scumbag cunt.

01:52:32.876 --> 01:52:34.419
I think I saw a sign,
Villa Rosa, Charlie,

01:52:34.444 --> 01:52:36.241
10 minutes ago.

01:52:36.346 --> 01:52:38.678
How far you going, taco head?

01:52:38.749 --> 01:52:40.046
¿Que pasa?

01:52:40.117 --> 01:52:42.712
Wasn't that turn back there...
that sign that said "Villa Rosa"?

01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:44.754
Look at the meter!
It's rigged!

01:52:44.822 --> 01:52:46.483
He's rigged the fucking meter!

01:52:46.557 --> 01:52:47.581
Hey, asshole!

01:52:47.658 --> 01:52:50.149
Hey, I told you
fucking Villa Rosa!

01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:08.647
What are we going to do now?

01:53:08.748 --> 01:53:09.806
Fuck them.

01:53:10.917 --> 01:53:14.478
Yeah, sure.
How we going to get out of here?

01:53:14.587 --> 01:53:16.418
Fuck them all.

01:53:16.489 --> 01:53:17.923
Fuck the whores.

01:53:17.992 --> 01:53:19.425
Fuck the cab drivers.

01:53:19.493 --> 01:53:21.085
Fuck Mexico.

01:53:21.162 --> 01:53:25.223
Fuck Nixon, fuck Vietnam,
fuck them all.

01:53:25.299 --> 01:53:27.324
But how we going
to get out of here?

01:53:27.401 --> 01:53:29.495
They made me kill babies, man.

01:53:29.571 --> 01:53:30.833
Little gook babies.

01:53:30.906 --> 01:53:32.874
You ever have to kill a baby?

01:53:32.941 --> 01:53:35.375
Yeah. O.K., come on.
We'll get a ride.

01:53:35.444 --> 01:53:37.241
We got to get back to the villa.

01:53:37.312 --> 01:53:40.179
Fuck you!
What do you mean, O.K.?

01:53:40.248 --> 01:53:42.183
What do you mean, O.K.?

01:53:42.285 --> 01:53:45.914
You ever have to kill
a little gook baby?

01:53:46.055 --> 01:53:48.785
What the fuck do you know
what I did?

01:53:48.858 --> 01:53:50.792
I didn't think so.
I didn't think so.

01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:52.453
You're full of shit.

01:53:52.529 --> 01:53:53.928
No, you are.

01:53:53.997 --> 01:53:55.965
Leave me the fuck alone!

01:53:56.033 --> 01:53:57.091
You're nuts.

01:53:57.167 --> 01:53:58.930
The sun is going down.

01:53:59.002 --> 01:54:01.232
We got to get out of here.

01:54:01.305 --> 01:54:03.774
Don't shit me, Kovic.
You never killed a baby.

01:54:03.842 --> 01:54:05.275
You never had to.

01:54:05.343 --> 01:54:08.210
You never put your soul
into that war,

01:54:08.279 --> 01:54:10.213
never put your soul on the line.

01:54:10.281 --> 01:54:12.181
How the fuck do you know?

01:54:12.250 --> 01:54:15.219
Maybe I killed more babies
than you did, you fuck!

01:54:15.286 --> 01:54:16.549
Maybe I did,

01:54:16.655 --> 01:54:19.783
but I don't have
to talk about it!

01:54:19.892 --> 01:54:22.360
Why not?
Why the fuck not?

01:54:22.428 --> 01:54:23.827
What are you hiding?

01:54:23.896 --> 01:54:26.660
What are you,
better than anybody else?

01:54:26.732 --> 01:54:28.166
You a hero, maybe?

01:54:28.235 --> 01:54:30.135
Got a bunch of fucking medals,

01:54:30.203 --> 01:54:32.501
but deep down
you're full of shit!

01:54:32.572 --> 01:54:35.268
You never fought.
You weren't even there.

01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:41.840
What the fuck do you mean,
I wasn't there, man?

01:54:41.916 --> 01:54:43.850
Come on, hero, come clean.

01:54:43.918 --> 01:54:45.385
Why should I?

01:54:45.453 --> 01:54:46.852
What are you hiding?

01:54:46.921 --> 01:54:49.253
You're the one that's hiding
here in Mexico.

01:54:49.357 --> 01:54:52.122
What are you hiding from,
you whiny fuck?

01:54:52.227 --> 01:54:53.660
Don't shit me!

01:54:53.729 --> 01:54:56.698
You never killed anybody, anything,
did you, Kovic?

01:54:56.765 --> 01:54:57.732
Did you?

01:54:57.799 --> 01:55:00.097
Ever look at yourself
in the fucking mirror?

01:55:00.168 --> 01:55:01.066
Fuck you.
You.

01:55:01.136 --> 01:55:03.230
No... you!

01:55:03.306 --> 01:55:04.102
Fuck you!

01:55:04.173 --> 01:55:05.970
No, fuck you!

01:55:20.558 --> 01:55:22.150
Get off me!

01:55:38.311 --> 01:55:41.371
Hola, señores.
¿Que pasa aqui?

01:55:44.216 --> 01:55:45.808
We need a ride.

01:55:45.885 --> 01:55:47.250
O.K.!

01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:48.719
Vamanos!

01:55:52.659 --> 01:55:54.092
You O.K., man?

01:55:54.161 --> 01:55:56.391
Fuck you.
You're full of shit.

01:55:56.496 --> 01:55:59.465
You don't get it.
You don't get it.

01:55:59.533 --> 01:56:02.298
You had a town once, Charlie,

01:56:02.370 --> 01:56:04.270
and a mother and father.

01:56:04.339 --> 01:56:06.603
Things that made sense.

01:56:06.674 --> 01:56:09.643
Do you remember
things that made sense,

01:56:09.711 --> 01:56:11.611
things you could count on,

01:56:11.679 --> 01:56:15.116
before we all got so lost?

01:56:21.523 --> 01:56:24.458
What are we going
to do, Charlie?

01:56:24.526 --> 01:56:27.121
What am I going to do, man?

01:56:33.937 --> 01:56:36.167
What am I going to do?

01:58:13.712 --> 01:58:15.145
Where you from, Wilson?

01:58:15.214 --> 01:58:16.146
Venus, Georgia.

01:58:16.215 --> 01:58:18.649
Georgia?
This is my second tour,

01:58:18.717 --> 01:58:22.654
and I haven't seen
a Georgia boy get it yet.

01:58:22.722 --> 01:58:23.814
Yeah?

01:58:27.761 --> 01:58:29.729
Yeah, I know about Wilson.

01:58:29.796 --> 01:58:32.697
Sir, I think I might
have killed him, sir.

01:58:32.766 --> 01:58:34.530
I think I killed him.

01:58:34.602 --> 01:58:36.194
I don't think so.

01:59:22.253 --> 01:59:25.222
You don't have to worry
about them dogs.

01:59:25.290 --> 01:59:26.780
They won't bite.

01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:30.827
Y'all get away now.

01:59:30.895 --> 01:59:32.294
Get on away!

01:59:32.397 --> 01:59:34.832
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:37.835
They're probably just
afraid of that chair.

01:59:37.903 --> 01:59:40.167
Mr. Wilson,
I'm Ron.

01:59:40.239 --> 01:59:42.673
Thanks for, uh, for seeing me.

01:59:42.741 --> 01:59:46.178
Any friend of Billy's
is a friend of ours.

01:59:46.246 --> 01:59:50.307
Well, uh, why don't you
come on in the house?

01:59:50.383 --> 01:59:53.978
My wife fixed some chicken,
if'n you want some.

01:59:56.757 --> 01:59:59.658
Yes, sir, it was
a real nice funeral.

01:59:59.727 --> 02:00:03.458
Marine Honor Guard came
all the way down from Atlanta

02:00:03.531 --> 02:00:04.964
in their fancy uniforms.

02:00:05.066 --> 02:00:08.093
Fired their rifles
up in the sky.

02:00:08.203 --> 02:00:09.135
Thank you.

02:00:09.204 --> 02:00:10.535
The drums was beating.

02:00:10.606 --> 02:00:13.006
'Course it was nothing
like the big war

02:00:13.075 --> 02:00:15.771
100 years ago down here.

02:00:17.145 --> 02:00:23.085
But there was Billy
and Bruce... Bruce Crabtree...

02:00:23.152 --> 02:00:24.710
Andy Henderson.

02:00:24.787 --> 02:00:27.551
And the Rutledge boy, Lance.

02:00:27.624 --> 02:00:30.184
Yeah, Lance.
He was a nice boy.

02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:31.694
For the life of me,

02:00:31.762 --> 02:00:34.196
I still can't quite
figure that war out.

02:00:34.265 --> 02:00:37.598
Why we had to go
all that dang way to fight it

02:00:37.668 --> 02:00:41.627
and why's we had to lose
so many young men.

02:00:41.705 --> 02:00:43.674
Can't figure it out.

02:00:45.010 --> 02:00:48.912
But we got a proud tradition
here in this town.

02:00:48.980 --> 02:00:52.711
Billy's great-grandfather
was at the First Bull Run.

02:00:52.784 --> 02:00:55.982
My pa was over in France in '18.

02:00:56.055 --> 02:01:00.014
Don't forget, you were
over in the Pacific in '44.

02:01:00.092 --> 02:01:01.081
Guadalcanal.

02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.457
Is that right?

02:01:02.528 --> 02:01:05.497
Yeah. Well, I guess
this family's fought

02:01:05.564 --> 02:01:09.001
in every war that, uh,
this country's ever had.

02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:12.004
I reckon we're ready
to do it again

02:01:12.105 --> 02:01:13.732
if'n we have to.

02:01:16.276 --> 02:01:21.010
'Course they never did know
what done happened and all.

02:01:21.082 --> 02:01:24.916
There was a letter
from a colonel,

02:01:24.986 --> 02:01:26.510
I think it was.

02:01:26.587 --> 02:01:27.747
Colonel Moore.

02:01:27.822 --> 02:01:30.257
That's right, Colonel Moore.

02:01:30.326 --> 02:01:33.295
He said there was
a bad ambush one night.

02:01:33.362 --> 02:01:37.423
Said that Billy distinguished himself
in the fighting.

02:01:37.499 --> 02:01:40.900
He also told us that
Billy died real quick.

02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:43.963
That's good that he died quick.

02:01:58.622 --> 02:02:00.556
I was his squad leader.

02:02:00.624 --> 02:02:03.058
I didn't know Billy real well.

02:02:03.127 --> 02:02:05.562
He was new, kind of quiet.

02:02:05.630 --> 02:02:09.566
We didn't talk much to new guys.

02:02:09.634 --> 02:02:12.034
He was 19, is that right?

02:02:12.104 --> 02:02:13.696
That's right, 19.

02:02:13.772 --> 02:02:14.796
Only son?

02:02:14.873 --> 02:02:17.240
Yes, sir.
My only boy.

02:02:17.310 --> 02:02:20.302
I think he said he was married

02:02:20.380 --> 02:02:21.847
and you were pregnant?

02:02:24.450 --> 02:02:27.283
I remember
the day he was killed.

02:02:27.353 --> 02:02:31.313
Uh... it was
a strange day.

02:02:31.392 --> 02:02:35.590
We were out on patrol
near a beach area...

02:02:35.662 --> 02:02:38.790
and, oh, it was very confusing.

02:02:38.866 --> 02:02:41.529
There was screaming and firing.

02:02:41.603 --> 02:02:42.865
Uh...

02:02:44.839 --> 02:02:46.306
It was getting late,

02:02:46.374 --> 02:02:52.245
and there were these
children, uh...

02:02:52.348 --> 02:02:55.545
these babies...

02:02:55.651 --> 02:02:58.211
that we killed by mistake.

02:02:59.989 --> 02:03:01.320
How awful.

02:03:03.025 --> 02:03:04.687
And then it...

02:03:04.761 --> 02:03:07.753
got really crazy.

02:03:09.633 --> 02:03:11.863
And we had to pull back

02:03:11.935 --> 02:03:16.270
because the NVA
were coming up on us.

02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:19.309
And we got scattered
in the dunes.

02:03:19.377 --> 02:03:20.901
People were yelling at anything,

02:03:20.978 --> 02:03:23.412
firing at anything.

02:03:23.481 --> 02:03:26.541
And that was when it...
it happened.

02:03:27.686 --> 02:03:30.655
I was, uh, confused...

02:03:30.722 --> 02:03:31.848
scared.

02:03:39.031 --> 02:03:41.626
I raised my rifle three times...

02:03:45.705 --> 02:03:49.004
and... shots...

02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:55.471
The body fell in the dunes.

02:03:57.952 --> 02:03:59.385
God, this is...

02:03:59.487 --> 02:04:02.388
this is very difficult
for me to say.

02:04:02.456 --> 02:04:04.789
We don't have to hear this, Ron.

02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:08.626
But I think I was the one
that killed your son.

02:04:08.697 --> 02:04:11.894
I was the one.
I was the one.

02:04:15.171 --> 02:04:16.763
I was the one.

02:04:35.292 --> 02:04:37.783
What's done is done, sir.

02:04:37.895 --> 02:04:40.558
I can't ever forgive you...

02:04:41.633 --> 02:04:43.999
but maybe the Lord can.

02:04:55.381 --> 02:04:57.975
We understand, Ron.

02:05:01.220 --> 02:05:06.750
We understand the pain
you've been going through.

02:06:24.177 --> 02:06:25.371
Peace now!

02:06:25.445 --> 02:06:26.412
Peace now!

02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:27.344
Peace now!

02:06:27.414 --> 02:06:28.346
Peace now!

02:06:28.415 --> 02:06:29.939
Peace now!

02:06:30.017 --> 02:06:32.144
Bring our brothers home now!

02:06:32.219 --> 02:06:33.447
Bring our brothers home now!

02:06:33.553 --> 02:06:35.488
Bring our brothers home now!

02:06:35.556 --> 02:06:37.023
Bring our brothers home now!

02:06:37.091 --> 02:06:38.956
Bring our brothers home now!

02:06:39.027 --> 02:06:40.790
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:06:40.862 --> 02:06:42.625
we don't want your fucking war!

02:06:42.697 --> 02:06:44.221
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:06:44.299 --> 02:06:46.392
we don't want your fucking war!

02:06:46.467 --> 02:06:47.901
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:06:47.970 --> 02:06:50.131
we don't want your fucking war!

02:06:50.205 --> 02:06:52.070
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:06:52.141 --> 02:06:53.972
we don't want your fucking war!

02:06:54.043 --> 02:06:55.977
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:06:56.045 --> 02:06:58.138
we don't want your fucking war!

02:06:58.213 --> 02:06:59.977
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:07:00.050 --> 02:07:01.813
we don't want your fucking war!

02:07:01.885 --> 02:07:03.819
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:07:03.887 --> 02:07:05.980
we don't want your fucking war!

02:07:06.089 --> 02:07:09.957
Bring our brothers home now!

02:07:10.026 --> 02:07:14.726
Drugs. Marijuana.
Traffic violations.

02:07:14.799 --> 02:07:16.198
Separate the hippies.

02:07:16.267 --> 02:07:20.033
Tonight, I again proudly
accept your nomination

02:07:20.104 --> 02:07:22.699
for President
of the United States.

02:07:24.943 --> 02:07:27.275
And let us place ourselves

02:07:27.346 --> 02:07:29.371
to win an even greater victory

02:07:29.448 --> 02:07:31.075
this November in 1972.

02:07:32.751 --> 02:07:34.242
Four more years!

02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:35.651
Four more years!

02:07:35.722 --> 02:07:37.280
Four more years!

02:07:37.357 --> 02:07:38.756
Four more years!

02:07:38.858 --> 02:07:40.155
Four more years!

02:07:40.259 --> 02:07:41.954
Four more years!

02:07:42.061 --> 02:07:43.858
Four more years!

02:07:43.930 --> 02:07:45.397
Four more years!

02:07:45.498 --> 02:07:46.523
Four more years!

02:07:46.633 --> 02:07:48.658
Can I break through
your complacency?

02:07:48.769 --> 02:07:50.202
Do you have compassion

02:07:50.270 --> 02:07:52.795
for the people
suffering in this war?

02:07:52.873 --> 02:07:55.967
I'm telling you
this war is a crime!

02:07:56.043 --> 02:07:59.013
I'm not as bitter
about my wounds...

02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:01.514
Who do you think you are?

02:08:01.583 --> 02:08:02.982
Can I help you, sir?

02:08:03.051 --> 02:08:04.484
You can't come through.

02:08:04.552 --> 02:08:06.019
You can't come through, sir.

02:08:06.087 --> 02:08:07.918
I have a pass.

02:08:14.063 --> 02:08:15.530
Who are these people?

02:08:15.631 --> 02:08:17.792
You can't stop us!

02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:19.367
You can't stop me!

02:08:19.435 --> 02:08:20.868
You can't stop me!

02:08:20.936 --> 02:08:22.268
Why are you here tonight?

02:08:22.339 --> 02:08:24.432
What do you have to say?

02:08:24.508 --> 02:08:25.941
My name's Ron Kovic.

02:08:26.009 --> 02:08:27.408
I'm a Vietnam veteran.

02:08:27.477 --> 02:08:30.446
I'm here to say
this war is wrong,

02:08:30.514 --> 02:08:34.007
that this society lied
to me and my brothers...

02:08:34.085 --> 02:08:35.552
Why don't you shut up?

02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:38.282
It deceived the people
in this country.

02:08:38.356 --> 02:08:41.848
It tricked them
into going 13,000 miles

02:08:41.926 --> 02:08:46.261
to fight a war against
a poor peasant people

02:08:46.365 --> 02:08:49.027
who have a proud history
of resistance,

02:08:49.134 --> 02:08:52.934
who have been struggling
for their own independence

02:08:53.005 --> 02:08:55.371
for 1,000 years...
the Vietnamese people.

02:08:55.441 --> 02:08:59.344
I can't... I can't find
the words to express

02:08:59.412 --> 02:09:02.347
how the leadership
of this government sickens me.

02:09:02.415 --> 02:09:04.906
Now, people say...

02:09:04.984 --> 02:09:08.250
people say if you
don't love America,

02:09:08.322 --> 02:09:09.721
then get the hell out.

02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:11.223
Well, I love America,

02:09:11.292 --> 02:09:14.227
but when it comes
to the government,

02:09:14.295 --> 02:09:15.853
it stops right there.

02:09:15.930 --> 02:09:18.626
The government is
a bunch of corrupt thieves.

02:09:18.699 --> 02:09:20.691
They are rapists and robbers.

02:09:20.802 --> 02:09:22.235
We are here to say

02:09:22.304 --> 02:09:24.204
we don't
have to take it anymore.

02:09:24.272 --> 02:09:26.968
We are here to tell the truth.

02:09:27.042 --> 02:09:29.237
They're killing
our brothers in Vietnam.

02:09:29.311 --> 02:09:31.211
We want them to hear the truth.

02:09:31.279 --> 02:09:32.178
Traitor!

02:09:32.248 --> 02:09:34.648
What are you, a communist?

02:09:36.886 --> 02:09:38.285
Is this what we get,

02:09:38.354 --> 02:09:40.345
spit in the face?

02:09:41.824 --> 02:09:43.223
Is this what we get?

02:09:43.293 --> 02:09:46.592
Is this what we get, sir?
Spit in the face?

02:09:46.663 --> 02:09:49.131
We're never going
to let the people

02:09:49.199 --> 02:09:50.928
forget that war!

02:09:51.001 --> 02:09:52.901
Four more years!

02:09:53.003 --> 02:09:55.438
You're not sweeping it
under the rug

02:09:55.507 --> 02:09:57.702
because you didn't
like the ratings.

02:09:57.809 --> 02:09:58.776
This wheelchair,

02:09:58.843 --> 02:09:59.741
our wheelchairs,

02:09:59.811 --> 02:10:01.278
this steel, our steel

02:10:01.346 --> 02:10:03.143
is your Memorial Day on wheels.

02:10:03.214 --> 02:10:05.682
We're your Yankee
Doodle Dandy come home.

02:10:05.750 --> 02:10:07.378
We're your Yankee Doodle Dandy.

02:10:07.453 --> 02:10:08.943
Let's reject any philosophy

02:10:09.021 --> 02:10:12.115
that would make us
a divided people of America.

02:10:12.191 --> 02:10:13.158
Stop the bombing!

02:10:13.225 --> 02:10:14.385
Stop the war!

02:10:14.460 --> 02:10:15.427
Stop the bombing!

02:10:15.494 --> 02:10:16.586
Stop the war!

02:10:24.771 --> 02:10:26.739
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!

02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:28.273
Some sort of scuffle

02:10:28.341 --> 02:10:30.902
has broken out
on the convention floor,

02:10:31.012 --> 02:10:33.446
disabled veterans
protesting the Vietnam War.

02:10:33.514 --> 02:10:35.311
We'll try to get down there.

02:10:35.383 --> 02:10:38.819
Why are they gassing us
in the parking lot?

02:10:38.886 --> 02:10:40.319
Why are they fighting us?

02:10:40.388 --> 02:10:41.855
Because it's a lie.

02:10:41.923 --> 02:10:43.323
The truth is

02:10:43.392 --> 02:10:45.485
they've killed a generation
of young men.

02:10:45.561 --> 02:10:46.960
They have sacrificed

02:10:47.029 --> 02:10:49.054
a whole generation of young men.

02:10:49.131 --> 02:10:50.723
Stop the bombing!

02:10:51.633 --> 02:10:53.498
Stop the bombing!

02:10:53.569 --> 02:10:54.935
Communists!

02:10:55.004 --> 02:10:56.733
Communists!

02:11:06.116 --> 02:11:07.048
Stop the bombing!

02:11:07.117 --> 02:11:08.414
Stop the war!

02:11:08.485 --> 02:11:10.350
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!

02:11:10.421 --> 02:11:12.616
Traitor!
Go home!

02:11:27.205 --> 02:11:29.470
I say to you tonight...

02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:32.943
in these times,

02:11:33.012 --> 02:11:35.981
when there is so much
of a tendency

02:11:36.048 --> 02:11:39.017
to run down those
who have served America

02:11:39.085 --> 02:11:40.849
in the past and today,

02:11:40.921 --> 02:11:44.357
let's give those
who have served in Vietnam

02:11:44.424 --> 02:11:46.358
the honor and the respect

02:11:46.426 --> 02:11:49.190
that they deserve
and that they've earned.

02:11:49.262 --> 02:11:51.059
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:11:51.131 --> 02:11:52.565
we don't want your fucking war!

02:11:52.634 --> 02:11:54.295
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:11:54.369 --> 02:11:56.132
we don't want your fucking war!

02:11:59.040 --> 02:12:00.473
Get the car!

02:12:00.541 --> 02:12:02.008
Get the car!

02:12:02.076 --> 02:12:03.475
Shut the fuck up!

02:12:03.544 --> 02:12:05.740
You're under arrest,
Kovic! Come on!

02:12:05.814 --> 02:12:06.781
What?

02:12:06.882 --> 02:12:07.940
Shut up!

02:12:08.050 --> 02:12:09.449
You're a pig?

02:12:09.518 --> 02:12:12.453
You should've died over there,
you traitor.

02:12:12.521 --> 02:12:13.988
I don't have balance.

02:12:14.089 --> 02:12:16.558
Give me your hands!

02:12:16.626 --> 02:12:18.355
O.K., I'll go
with you!

02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:24.858
I'm not under arrest.

02:12:24.934 --> 02:12:26.231
I don't have to...

02:12:26.302 --> 02:12:27.770
Hey, take it easy!

02:12:27.838 --> 02:12:31.171
Get your hands behind you!

02:12:31.242 --> 02:12:33.073
I'm paralyzed!

02:12:33.144 --> 02:12:36.045
Get those cameras out of here!

02:12:36.113 --> 02:12:37.045
Hey!

02:12:37.114 --> 02:12:38.445
Hey!

02:12:38.516 --> 02:12:40.144
I'm paralyzed!

02:12:40.252 --> 02:12:42.379
Get in the fucking car!

02:12:42.487 --> 02:12:43.511
Hey!

02:12:43.622 --> 02:12:44.646
Hey!

02:12:56.769 --> 02:12:57.701
My chair!

02:12:57.770 --> 02:12:58.862
My ch...

02:13:03.343 --> 02:13:04.401
Stop it!

02:13:23.198 --> 02:13:24.893
Tactical line!

02:13:24.966 --> 02:13:28.903
Advance and disperse the crowd!

02:13:29.939 --> 02:13:31.497
The whole world's watching!

02:13:31.574 --> 02:13:33.940
Let me go!

02:13:34.009 --> 02:13:35.033
You O.K.?

02:13:35.111 --> 02:13:36.544
Doc, is he O.K.?

02:13:36.612 --> 02:13:37.544
I'm O.K.

02:13:37.613 --> 02:13:39.047
How we doing here?

02:13:39.116 --> 02:13:40.515
How many fingers you got?

02:13:40.584 --> 02:13:41.949
Your head is cut.

02:13:42.018 --> 02:13:43.451
Anyplace else hurting?

02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:45.454
I'm O.K.
Where's my chair?

02:13:45.522 --> 02:13:46.955
Where's my chair?

02:13:47.057 --> 02:13:48.524
Bring his chair over!

02:13:48.592 --> 02:13:50.060
You're cut over your eye.

02:13:50.161 --> 02:13:52.288
The media's got to see this.

02:13:52.396 --> 02:13:54.091
We heard you shouted down Nixon.

02:13:54.165 --> 02:13:55.792
Eddie was arrested,

02:13:55.867 --> 02:13:57.334
they beat Peterson,

02:13:57.401 --> 02:13:58.800
O'Malley's gassed real bad,

02:13:58.870 --> 02:14:00.804
and Piscatelli's
got a concussion!

02:14:00.872 --> 02:14:03.740
It's a fucking mess over there!

02:14:03.809 --> 02:14:06.300
Frankie, bring the
media to the gate.

02:14:06.378 --> 02:14:07.345
What?

02:14:07.412 --> 02:14:08.845
The pigs are coming!

02:14:08.914 --> 02:14:10.313
They're clearing the park!

02:14:10.382 --> 02:14:12.350
They've arrested
like 30 people...

02:14:12.417 --> 02:14:13.851
O.K., O.K., listen up!

02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:15.820
Listen up.
Hey, hey, hey!

02:14:15.889 --> 02:14:17.823
We're going
to take the hall back.

02:14:17.891 --> 02:14:18.823
You hear?

02:14:18.892 --> 02:14:20.359
We're going to the gate,

02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:22.860
we're gonna take
the motherfucking hall back.

02:14:22.929 --> 02:14:24.794
Fall out! Let's move!

02:14:34.074 --> 02:14:36.008
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:14:36.076 --> 02:14:38.341
we don't want your fucking war!

02:14:38.413 --> 02:14:39.846
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:14:39.915 --> 02:14:41.780
we don't want your fucking war!

02:14:41.850 --> 02:14:43.784
1, 2, 3, 4,

02:14:43.852 --> 02:14:45.945
we don't want your fucking war!

02:15:08.979 --> 02:15:10.879
Let us reject the notion

02:15:10.948 --> 02:15:12.883
of politics of the few,

02:15:12.951 --> 02:15:15.442
by the few, and for the few.

02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:17.715
We dedicate ourselves
to the notion

02:15:17.822 --> 02:15:20.017
this is a government
of the people,

02:15:20.124 --> 02:15:22.524
by the people,
and for all the people,

02:15:22.594 --> 02:15:27.259
black, brown, red,
yellow, white, women,

02:15:27.333 --> 02:15:30.063
young, old, workers, students.

02:15:30.135 --> 02:15:32.660
This is our land
in this country.

02:15:32.738 --> 02:15:35.731
Ransom, the feminist,
she's six minutes over.

02:15:35.809 --> 02:15:37.709
I've got the Jackson people

02:15:37.777 --> 02:15:39.244
breathing down my neck.

02:15:39.312 --> 02:15:40.210
Who follows?

02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:41.713
It won't be a problem.

02:15:41.781 --> 02:15:42.713
You're next.

02:15:42.782 --> 02:15:43.714
Mr. Kovic?

02:15:43.783 --> 02:15:45.774
We're just about ready for you.

02:15:45.852 --> 02:15:47.343
Can I get you anything?

02:15:47.421 --> 02:15:48.683
Coke, iced tea?

02:15:48.756 --> 02:15:50.155
Let's do it.

02:15:50.224 --> 02:15:52.283
O.K., Ron.
It's your time.

02:15:52.393 --> 02:15:54.918
It's been a long way
to get here.

02:15:55.029 --> 02:15:56.997
Tell them what it is, Ron!

02:15:57.064 --> 02:15:58.463
Come on, Ronnie!

02:15:58.532 --> 02:16:01.001
Go get them, man.
For Eddie, man.

02:16:01.103 --> 02:16:02.502
Ronnie for president!

02:16:02.571 --> 02:16:03.503
Whoo!
Whoo!

02:16:03.572 --> 02:16:06.006
The whole world's
watching. I love you.

02:16:06.074 --> 02:16:07.541
All right, Frankie!

02:16:07.609 --> 02:16:09.008
I feel good.

02:16:09.077 --> 02:16:10.510
Ronnie for president.

02:16:10.579 --> 02:16:12.207
Whoo!

02:16:12.282 --> 02:16:13.909
Congratulations.

02:16:13.983 --> 02:16:17.316
I love what you're doing.

02:16:17.387 --> 02:16:20.254
Clear a path for me, please.
Stand back.

02:16:20.323 --> 02:16:21.381
Thank you.

02:16:22.693 --> 02:16:25.457
I had a dream, Ronnie.

02:16:25.562 --> 02:16:28.190
You were speaking
to a large crowd,

02:16:28.299 --> 02:16:31.427
and you were saying
great things.

02:16:39.678 --> 02:16:41.201
Our next speaker

02:16:41.279 --> 02:16:44.009
is one of our Vietnam veterans

02:16:44.082 --> 02:16:48.179
who has something very
special to say tonight.

02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:50.383
Please!

02:16:51.324 --> 02:16:52.757
Please be quiet!

02:16:52.825 --> 02:16:54.725
Coming up top.

02:16:54.794 --> 02:16:57.523
What will you
say tonight, Mr. Kovic?

02:16:57.596 --> 02:16:59.462
I'm going to tell the truth.

02:16:59.566 --> 02:17:01.534
Any plans for the future?

02:17:01.601 --> 02:17:03.568
I guess we'll see.

02:17:03.670 --> 02:17:06.605
Mr. Kovic, could you please
sign your book?

02:17:06.673 --> 02:17:08.163
A young man

02:17:08.275 --> 02:17:10.767
who comes from
Massapequa, Long Island...

02:17:10.844 --> 02:17:12.813
All righty, coming through!

02:17:12.879 --> 02:17:14.780
All right, sweetheart.
Straight on through.

02:17:14.849 --> 02:17:16.714
Straight on through.

02:17:16.784 --> 02:17:19.252
How does it feel
to address the entire country?

02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:21.254
Uh, overwhelming...

02:17:21.323 --> 02:17:22.290
an honor...

02:17:22.358 --> 02:17:25.259
It's been a long way for us...

02:17:25.326 --> 02:17:26.794
the vets... uh...

02:17:26.861 --> 02:17:31.822
Just lately I've felt
like I'm home.

02:17:31.933 --> 02:17:32.832
You know?

02:17:32.934 --> 02:17:35.928
Like, uh, maybe we're home.

02:17:37.374 --> 02:17:38.841
Welcome home, Ronnie!

02:17:38.907 --> 02:17:40.341
Go get them, Ron!
