Lookout post.

02:04.417 --> 02:05.876
Clear for miles.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.420
Now, you'll never get lost.

02:12.758 --> 02:13.758
Dad!

02:14.719 --> 02:15.803
Dad, no!

02:24.729 --> 02:26.105
Didn't sleep on the flight?

02:26.981 --> 02:27.981
Not much.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.902
- Well, I'm glad you could make it.
- Of course.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.822
I'd never miss today.

02:36.282 --> 02:38.242
Despite my busy schedule.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.327
How was the Danube?

02:40.494 --> 02:41.704
Not blue.

02:43.456 --> 02:45.291
It's all part of the walkabout.

02:46.709 --> 02:49.920
I'll have Adam drop you back
after the vote. Shouldn't take long.

02:51.088 --> 02:52.088
Thanks.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.235
Maddie's looking forward
to seeing you.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.846
- How is she?
- She's missing her mum.

02:59.013 --> 03:02.475
<i>No mining in the Pilbara!
Keep the Pilbara safe!</i>

03:02.641 --> 03:03.851
What's all this?

03:04.769 --> 03:06.729
<i>No mining in the Pilbara!</i>

03:06.896 --> 03:10.691
<i>Keep the Pilbara safe!
Hands off the Pilbara!</i>

03:10.858 --> 03:15.154
<i>No mining in the Pilbara!
Hands off the Pilbara!</i>

03:15.780 --> 03:18.115
Mr Kingley! Mr Downer!

03:19.116 --> 03:22.661
Mr Kingley, are you here to vote?
Can I get a statement, sir?

03:25.623 --> 03:28.417
Will you be voting yes
to leasing the farmland?

03:29.293 --> 03:30.378
Mr Kingley!

03:32.546 --> 03:35.675
- You go in, I'll talk to the hands.
- Thought we had this all under control.

03:35.841 --> 03:36.884
We do. Just ignore them.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.428
Okay, you look after Michael.
I will take care of this.

03:39.595 --> 03:42.056
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Ladies, ladies, please.

03:44.058 --> 03:48.062
All right. The decision to lease
the farmlands for sustainable mining

03:48.229 --> 03:50.606
has the support
of all local communities.

03:50.773 --> 03:54.985
After the votes, King Pastoral will
release a full statement outlining

03:55.152 --> 03:57.238
our intentions in the region.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.990
- Mr Kingley.
- Thank you very much. Now, go home.

04:00.157 --> 04:03.494
Sir, do you even care?
Do you have a conscience?

04:06.872 --> 04:09.417
I'll come for you
once everyone's assembled.

04:23.723 --> 04:26.726
- Maddie, hi.
- Grandpa, you've got to stop him.

04:26.892 --> 04:30.062
<i>- Dear, no. What do you mean?
</i>-My father.

04:30.229 --> 04:31.397
<i>But are you okay?</i>

04:31.564 --> 04:33.566
- I tried to call you.
<i>- Know what he's doing?</i>

04:33.733 --> 04:37.820
If I was 18...
If I was on the board, I'd stop him.

04:37.987 --> 04:39.780
<i>I'll send you a link.</i>

04:41.657 --> 04:44.827
Madeline...
I'll just be a minute.

04:45.494 --> 04:48.414
No phones during school hours.
Madeline, now!

04:49.457 --> 04:50.875
Just read it.

04:51.042 --> 04:52.960
<i>- I got to go.
- Thank you.</i>

04:55.129 --> 04:56.797
Pick it up at the end of school.

05:08.726 --> 05:09.810
Mr Kingley.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.772
- We're ready for you.
- Sure.

05:16.442 --> 05:19.028
- Just come through.
- This budget is very impressive.

05:19.195 --> 05:21.864
We'll just be a couple of minutes.
Wanna take a seat over there?

05:22.406 --> 05:23.406
Sure.

05:25.743 --> 05:28.371
Just make sure,
we're supposed to call a specialist.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.873
Cal. Julie.

05:31.040 --> 05:35.336
- Michael. Good to see you.
- Michael, how are things?

05:36.462 --> 05:38.714
I'd say there's a storm a-brewing.

05:40.675 --> 05:42.760
You'll never guess what I found.

05:42.927 --> 05:45.471
Lolly Gobble Bliss Bombs.

05:46.514 --> 05:48.349
- Where'd you get them?
- Singapore.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.811
- Oh, Michael.
- You don't have to share.

05:51.977 --> 05:52.978
I bought a stash.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.009
Oh, Jesus!

06:45.656 --> 06:46.656
Michael!

06:47.992 --> 06:49.201
Michael, be careful!

06:57.293 --> 06:58.461
What the heck was that?

06:59.170 --> 07:02.006
You okay? No glass get you?

07:02.173 --> 07:03.257
I'm fine.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.593
We're gonna have to reconvene
tomorrow for the vote.

07:05.760 --> 07:07.428
Room's a mess. I have to fly to Sydney.

07:08.304 --> 07:10.806
I thought we were planning
to have dinner with Maddie.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.767
I can't. I have to romance
the investors.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.518
So we can make a toast to Sonia.

07:15.853 --> 07:19.273
I'm sorry, but you know how it is.
We'll all go out tomorrow.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.693
She sent me this.

07:23.402 --> 07:26.238
Oh, Jesus. Look, it's not an issue.

07:26.405 --> 07:29.950
The land's been deregistered. You saw.
The elders are at the table with us.

07:30.117 --> 07:34.080
- She was pretty angry.
- You know what it's like at that age.

07:34.246 --> 07:38.042
Thinking everything your father does
is wrong or corrupt.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.002
It's nothing. I promise you.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.048
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.550
Tomorrow, Malcolm.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.761
It's important.

07:50.096 --> 07:51.096
Tomorrow.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.478
- Is he gonna be all right?
- He'll be fine.

09:10.134 --> 09:11.135
Did you see the birds?

09:13.596 --> 09:14.972
You're supposed to knock.

09:15.723 --> 09:19.226
That's the deal.
I don't lock, and everyone knocks.

09:22.355 --> 09:25.149
Did you see them on the beach?
The pelicans?

09:25.316 --> 09:27.109
- Did you read the article?
- Maddie...

09:27.276 --> 09:30.363
- Did you read it?
- It's your dad's company now.

09:30.529 --> 09:32.031
It was yours once.

09:32.698 --> 09:33.866
Yours and Mum's.

09:34.033 --> 09:37.370
In no time at all, you'll be sitting
on the board with your quarter share,

09:37.536 --> 09:40.581
- and you can debate your dad.
- It'll be too late by then.

09:40.748 --> 09:43.209
They'll have dug up half
of Western Australia.

09:43.376 --> 09:46.379
I'm just a link to old clients.
I don't make policy anymore.

09:46.545 --> 09:49.423
This will ruin the waterways and destroy
their indigenous homelands.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.468
- It's not right. You must see that.
- What do you want me to do?

09:52.635 --> 09:54.762
- Stop him!
- I can't do that.

09:55.388 --> 09:56.931
You're just like everyone else.

09:57.098 --> 09:59.600
- Gutless!
- Don't say that, Mads.

10:01.394 --> 10:04.397
- Not today.
- Mum would've been disgusted with you.

10:17.952 --> 10:18.952
And no.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.832
I didn't see anything on the beach.

12:29.583 --> 12:30.583
Grandpa.

12:38.926 --> 12:39.926
Grandpa.

12:46.976 --> 12:48.519
I'm sorry about shouting.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.065
I know none of this is really your fault,

12:54.358 --> 12:55.943
but I just get so angry.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.614
I once believed in things
like you do, Maddie.

13:02.074 --> 13:04.285
Things that were special to me.

13:18.341 --> 13:19.800
You okay, Grandpa?

13:22.178 --> 13:24.096
How are you, Mads?

13:24.263 --> 13:25.263
I'm fine.

13:27.308 --> 13:29.310
Well, I'm seeing birds.

13:32.355 --> 13:35.024
The beach I grew up on was filled
with them.

13:39.028 --> 13:41.072
I had problems with my father,

13:41.238 --> 13:42.698
just like you.

13:45.034 --> 13:46.660
I was angry.

13:46.827 --> 13:47.953
I didn't talk.

13:49.538 --> 13:50.538
I was so...

13:53.793 --> 13:55.753
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

13:56.796 --> 13:58.631
You go to bed.
I'll see you in the morning.

13:58.798 --> 14:00.216
I can stay up.

14:01.926 --> 14:04.887
- I don't wanna leave you out here alone.
- I'm fine.

14:08.349 --> 14:09.350
It's just...

14:11.268 --> 14:12.268
Mum.

14:14.730 --> 14:15.773
Her birthday.

14:16.482 --> 14:17.482
Yeah.

14:23.114 --> 14:26.200
You're looking more and more like her
every time I see you.

14:31.831 --> 14:33.791
Tell me about growing up on the beach.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.377
Mum never told me anything.

14:43.092 --> 14:44.093
Please?

14:50.349 --> 14:52.059
It was called Ninety Mile Beach.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.189
I lived there for most of my childhood.

15:03.154 --> 15:04.780
<i>My home was a little shack,</i>

15:06.157 --> 15:09.243
<i>perched on a long stretch
of sand hills and scrub.</i>

15:10.911 --> 15:13.039
<i>Just down south in the Coorong.</i>

15:14.582 --> 15:18.336
<i>Shallow water on one side
and a massive ocean on the other.</i>

15:20.129 --> 15:21.630
<i>We left the city.</i>

15:22.465 --> 15:25.718
<i>My dad wanted to be as far away
from anyone as possible.</i>

15:27.219 --> 15:30.806
<i>We'd go for days and weeks
without seeing another person.</i>

15:32.391 --> 15:34.518
<i>I spent my days on the sea.</i>

15:38.189 --> 15:40.274
<i>And my nights doing home school.</i>

15:41.108 --> 15:44.362
"Now, tell us. What's your name?

15:45.321 --> 15:50.242
Percival Wemys Madison, the...

15:50.409 --> 15:53.662
- The Vicarage."
- Vicarage.

15:54.372 --> 15:55.915
It's a priest's house.

15:59.168 --> 16:02.922
"The Vicarage, Harcourt Street.

16:04.799 --> 16:08.386
Antone... Anthony, Hants."

16:10.346 --> 16:12.723
<i>And in the mornings,
I watched the birds.</i>

16:15.184 --> 16:17.937
<i>The world might have seemed harsh
to my dad and me...</i>

16:19.480 --> 16:20.648
<i>but not to them.</i>

16:21.941 --> 16:23.192
<i>They were home.</i>

16:43.421 --> 16:47.049
I didn't really know any other life.
I was cut off from the world.

16:48.009 --> 16:50.594
Then one day, the world came to me.

18:06.754 --> 18:08.005
He's come in again.

18:08.172 --> 18:11.801
- Needed supplies. Kero.
- How's his boy, say?

18:11.967 --> 18:13.010
He said he's fine.

18:13.177 --> 18:15.304
It's not right.
A boy living alone out there...

18:15.471 --> 18:16.555
Leave him be.

18:19.767 --> 18:20.768
Here you are.

18:23.437 --> 18:26.190
- Settle up next time?
- No worries.

18:36.075 --> 18:38.160
That's all town's talking about.

18:38.327 --> 18:40.162
Ten thousand acres.

18:40.329 --> 18:43.457
See, the hunters want it for shooting.

18:43.624 --> 18:46.794
The other folks wanna turn it
into what they call a sanctuary.

18:46.961 --> 18:51.799
- It's a safe place for the birds.
- Well, what do you think will happen?

18:51.966 --> 18:53.592
I think the vote'll be close,

18:54.301 --> 18:56.804
but, knowing people,
they'll probably side with the hunters.

18:57.221 --> 18:58.973
Who cares about a bunch of birds?

19:59.992 --> 20:01.160
It's a midden.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.708
Proper white man word is "midden."

20:08.793 --> 20:10.711
They used to crack shellfish here.

20:11.337 --> 20:12.337
Good tucker.

20:13.339 --> 20:14.340
Where do you come from?

20:15.800 --> 20:16.801
Just about.

20:19.261 --> 20:20.261
You scared of me?

20:21.347 --> 20:22.347
No.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.809
Fingerbone Bill's my name.

20:29.230 --> 20:30.481
You know what I call you?

20:35.653 --> 20:38.322
Because you walk in the big blow,
I've seen you.

20:40.157 --> 20:41.492
I've seen you too.

20:42.326 --> 20:43.327
See.

20:45.162 --> 20:48.165
We know each other.
No reason to be scared.

20:49.667 --> 20:52.336
My people made camp here,
long time ago.

20:52.503 --> 20:54.255
No white fellas.

20:54.422 --> 20:57.299
For thousands of years,
just black fellas.

21:00.928 --> 21:05.224
Well, if I lived here back then,
I'd have been a black fella.

21:06.308 --> 21:07.601
Reckon it so.

21:08.769 --> 21:11.022
Hey, you're right. Telling it proper.

21:44.722 --> 21:46.307
There'll be a storm soon.

21:48.184 --> 21:51.228
When pelican is killed,
there'll always be storm.

22:00.029 --> 22:01.029
Look!

22:06.285 --> 22:08.412
- They're alive.
- Yeah.

22:09.163 --> 22:11.248
The other birds will look
after them, right?

22:12.291 --> 22:14.210
It's not their way, <i>Mantawu Mgauriri</i>.

22:14.377 --> 22:15.795
We can't let them die.

22:15.961 --> 22:18.089
They're too young.
There's nothing we can do.

22:19.715 --> 22:20.925
They won't die.

22:49.286 --> 22:50.329
Good to go.

23:13.894 --> 23:14.979
Morning.

23:16.397 --> 23:17.481
Michael!

23:19.358 --> 23:21.444
Oh, God.

23:22.862 --> 23:26.365
I must have fallen asleep,
I completely crashed.

23:34.832 --> 23:36.292
Thanks for the coffee, Angela.

23:40.921 --> 23:43.090
Thought you might need
a hair of the dog, Grandpa.

23:48.012 --> 23:49.764
Go on, then. I'll take a wallop.

23:50.973 --> 23:53.559
- One wallop coming right up.
- Come on!

23:53.726 --> 23:56.437
Finish your coffee.
You got to get a move on.

23:56.604 --> 23:58.731
I've got my first two periods free.
It's fine.

24:02.234 --> 24:03.444
God.

24:06.280 --> 24:08.574
So tell me more about the birds.

24:09.825 --> 24:11.911
I thought you weren't interested.
You fell asleep.

24:12.953 --> 24:14.121
No, I heard it all.

24:14.914 --> 24:15.914
Tell me.

24:17.541 --> 24:18.541
Yeah?

24:20.086 --> 24:25.132
Oh, I had no idea what to do next.
How to keep those birds alive.

24:27.301 --> 24:28.552
Grab some grass.

24:32.098 --> 24:34.558
<i>There were no vets
on Ninety Mile Beach.</i>

24:34.725 --> 24:36.977
<i>Or libraries to look stuff up.</i>

24:47.613 --> 24:49.323
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

24:49.490 --> 24:52.034
- Come on in.
- Your father here?

24:52.910 --> 24:54.161
No, it's okay.

24:54.328 --> 24:55.329
Come in.

24:55.496 --> 24:59.417
This is his house. We have not met.
I'll stay out here.

25:08.718 --> 25:11.637
It's gonna be okay. Gonna be okay now.

25:12.346 --> 25:13.346
Hear me?

25:14.348 --> 25:15.474
What you gonna feed them?

25:17.852 --> 25:20.479
- Dad's got some bait.
- They can't eat proper fish.

25:21.105 --> 25:22.189
They're too small.

25:36.495 --> 25:39.290
- What's that?
- Help them not get sick.

25:42.334 --> 25:43.544
How are you gonna feed them?

25:45.087 --> 25:47.340
Reckon you're gonna have to do it
like their mum does.

25:48.132 --> 25:52.470
I can't do it like their mum. They stick
their head in her mouth and she...

25:53.888 --> 25:55.139
Chucks up into them.

25:56.682 --> 25:58.309
I can't do that. It's...

26:04.857 --> 26:06.067
I've got an idea.

26:15.076 --> 26:17.703
I don't think this is a good idea!

26:19.121 --> 26:22.708
In fact, I'm sure it's a bad idea!

26:22.875 --> 26:24.335
Just do it!

26:38.974 --> 26:39.974
Special one.

26:41.435 --> 26:42.435
It's good.

26:45.981 --> 26:47.775
Please. Please.

26:56.450 --> 26:59.120
- It worked.
- Give them as much as they'll take.

27:00.162 --> 27:01.831
Get them strong, <i>Mantawu Mgauriri</i>.

27:03.165 --> 27:06.877
- Where are you going?
- Gonna wash good in the rain.

27:07.044 --> 27:08.462
I smell something fierce.

27:49.879 --> 27:52.673
What's that smell?
You've been cutting up fish?

27:52.840 --> 27:56.010
- I've got something to show you, Dad.
- What's all over you?

27:56.635 --> 27:59.472
I used the outboard
to make some food. They like it.

28:01.599 --> 28:03.059
Where did you find them?

28:04.060 --> 28:05.478
In the sand hills.

28:05.644 --> 28:08.147
Hunters killed their mum.
Fingerbone said they would've died

28:08.314 --> 28:09.899
- if I hadn't brought them home.
- Who?

28:10.441 --> 28:12.276
Fingerbone. He helped me.

28:13.819 --> 28:15.321
He said he didn't wanna come in.

28:15.488 --> 28:17.323
He said it wasn't right
if you weren't home.

28:17.948 --> 28:19.158
He's my friend, Dad.

28:20.868 --> 28:23.162
He said to be like their mum.
She pukes down their throat.

28:23.329 --> 28:25.790
- I wasn't gonna do that.
- No.

28:25.956 --> 28:26.956
So I made this.

28:27.708 --> 28:29.043
Dad, can I keep them?

28:29.669 --> 28:34.173
- Well, the little one looks pretty weak.
- Please? I'll look after them good.

28:35.257 --> 28:36.926
Let's just see how we go.

28:46.143 --> 28:47.143
Good day.

28:48.813 --> 28:49.813
Good day.

28:50.356 --> 28:51.356
I'm Tom.

28:52.358 --> 28:53.358
Hideaway Tom.

28:53.943 --> 28:55.903
- That's what they call you.
- I know.

28:57.613 --> 29:00.908
- This your idea, then? The birds?
- No.

29:01.701 --> 29:02.827
I just helped.

29:03.619 --> 29:06.580
- It was <i>Mantawu Mgauriri's</i> thought.
- Sorry?

29:06.747 --> 29:08.999
<i>Mantawu Mgauriri,</i> that's his name.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.796
I haven't seen him this excited
in a long time.

29:15.047 --> 29:17.341
He'll proper take good care
of the birds.

29:18.050 --> 29:20.011
Let's hope they make it
through the night.

29:25.057 --> 29:28.728
Can I come back in the morning?
See how they're doing?

29:30.771 --> 29:32.023
I don't see why not.

29:53.878 --> 29:55.171
You're the littlest.

30:00.051 --> 30:01.051
Come on.

30:01.677 --> 30:03.137
Gotta keep eating.

30:09.769 --> 30:10.769
Please.

30:18.277 --> 30:19.277
Dad.

30:20.613 --> 30:22.239
Could I use your scarf?

30:27.453 --> 30:28.704
Promise to give it back?

30:31.749 --> 30:32.749
Promise.

30:55.356 --> 30:56.649
Aren't you getting into bed?

30:57.983 --> 31:00.861
No, I'm just gonna sleep
down here with them.

31:01.612 --> 31:03.072
So they know someone's here.

31:07.159 --> 31:08.244
It's a good idea.

31:10.413 --> 31:11.413
Night.

31:12.373 --> 31:13.373
Good night, Dad.

31:46.407 --> 31:47.950
Please don't die.

32:14.518 --> 32:15.518
Come on in.

32:40.378 --> 32:42.546
I brought him into bed. It's warmer.

32:48.678 --> 32:49.804
They didn't die.

32:53.849 --> 32:56.936
They're going to, aren't they?

32:57.103 --> 33:00.314
- Those birds were tough.
- They're gonna die.

33:00.481 --> 33:01.481
I know it.

33:02.358 --> 33:05.945
Excuse me, Michael.
Adam's here to drive you.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.408
Do you have to go?

33:13.035 --> 33:14.035
For the vote?

33:14.078 --> 33:16.580
- Yeah.
- So Dad's back?

33:16.747 --> 33:19.417
- I imagine so.
- I hate him.

33:19.583 --> 33:21.419
- Maddie.
- I do!

33:29.051 --> 33:31.303
Maddie. Mads?

33:34.265 --> 33:35.599
Why are you still here?

33:35.766 --> 33:38.144
It's still early.
I could do with the exercise.

33:39.186 --> 33:43.024
Do you fancy a morning's constitutional
on the rocks?

33:49.780 --> 33:52.575
I had to feed those birds
eight times a day.

33:54.493 --> 33:56.662
Even Dad tried to help out.

33:58.289 --> 34:01.208
There. I call it "Tom's twister."

34:02.001 --> 34:05.713
Put your oil, your fish, your kelp,
and whatnot...

34:05.880 --> 34:07.048
Put her in there.

34:10.259 --> 34:12.303
"Sim Sala Bim." Instant muck.

34:12.469 --> 34:14.304
Until you can start
feeding them whole fish,

34:14.472 --> 34:16.306
it's got to be better
than using my outboard.

35:25.209 --> 35:29.213
We are never going to sleep again.

35:30.089 --> 35:31.257
Never!

35:33.009 --> 35:34.135
You using my glass?

35:41.726 --> 35:44.937
You'd think I was grandad pelican,
the way they're turning to me for food.

35:45.104 --> 35:46.480
Well, you sort of are now.

35:47.898 --> 35:50.484
Look at this bloke,
sitting up like he owns the place.

35:50.651 --> 35:51.819
That's Mr Proud.

35:53.362 --> 35:55.531
- Oh, you've named them?
- Yeah.

35:57.033 --> 36:00.661
This is Mr Ponder
because he's very wise and serious.

36:00.828 --> 36:02.329
Mr Proud, Mr Ponder.

36:03.247 --> 36:05.958
What about this little bloke?
What's he then, Mr Peep?

36:06.834 --> 36:08.294
It's Mr Percival.

36:09.962 --> 36:11.464
Like the boy in the book I read.

36:12.631 --> 36:14.842
The smallest and the weakest...

36:15.551 --> 36:16.802
but he doesn't die.

36:19.221 --> 36:21.682
Well, you keep feeding him...

36:23.559 --> 36:25.061
he'll grow up to be big and strong.

37:57.653 --> 37:58.988
Go on. Hey, just wait.

37:59.363 --> 38:00.865
Be patient, please.

38:01.032 --> 38:04.994
Would you just...?
Knock it off! Settle down. Oi, stop.

38:06.328 --> 38:07.328
Go on.

38:08.914 --> 38:09.914
Happy now?

38:14.545 --> 38:16.756
Ten pounds a day they're eating.

38:16.922 --> 38:18.257
Ten pounds.

38:18.424 --> 38:20.134
More than we eat in a week.

38:27.433 --> 38:29.310
Over here, Mr Proud. Ready?

38:31.270 --> 38:33.564
Here you go. Grab it. Thattaboy.

38:34.732 --> 38:37.693
Come on. Come on, Mr Ponder.
Come here. Here, guys.

38:40.488 --> 38:41.947
Get it. Come on.

38:42.114 --> 38:43.699
That's it, Mr Percival.

38:45.951 --> 38:48.788
Come on, I know you want it. Kick it.

38:57.296 --> 38:59.131
You want hit it right now? Come get it.

38:59.632 --> 39:00.966
Give it to Percival.

39:47.847 --> 39:48.847
What are you doing?

39:51.475 --> 39:53.227
Just talking to the land.

39:53.394 --> 39:54.687
Paying my respects.

40:23.174 --> 40:26.469
No, I'm not going out today.
You can catch your own brekkie.

40:33.017 --> 40:36.020
Hey. I don't care how much racket
you make. I'm not going out!

40:36.187 --> 40:38.606
Hey! You hear me? Piss off!

40:39.315 --> 40:40.608
Get out!

40:42.109 --> 40:45.529
Go. Shoo! Get away, go. Shoo.

40:45.696 --> 40:48.282
- Please, just go.
- Get out of here, you mongrels.

40:48.449 --> 40:50.368
You guys are gonna get us
into big trouble.

40:50.534 --> 40:53.371
Is a little bit of privacy
too much to ask for?

40:53.537 --> 40:55.039
In the middle of nowhere!

40:56.123 --> 40:58.834
- Can't you talk to them, Mr P?
- Get out!

40:59.001 --> 41:00.001
Dad's going nuts.

41:00.878 --> 41:04.465
Get out, you mongrels. Get out! No!

41:05.132 --> 41:06.132
No way!

41:47.842 --> 41:50.553
You wanna buy fish?
You catch your own, don't you?

41:50.720 --> 41:53.305
Yeah, well, got a couple extra mouths
to feed, don't I?

41:57.893 --> 41:59.020
It's amazing.

42:00.187 --> 42:01.355
That's one word for it.

42:18.456 --> 42:21.709
You can use your special glass now.
We're done with it.

42:21.876 --> 42:23.961
Thanks, I think I'll stick with this.

42:33.804 --> 42:35.598
They're gonna have to go back soon.

42:37.850 --> 42:40.811
- Go back where?
- Well, where they belong.

42:42.605 --> 42:45.274
We can't afford to keep feeding them,
and even if we could,

42:46.233 --> 42:48.652
- a life in captivity...
- This isn't captivity.

42:48.819 --> 42:50.112
You know what I mean.

42:51.614 --> 42:53.491
Wild things need to be free.

42:54.533 --> 42:57.703
These birds could live
to be 30, 40 years old.

42:57.870 --> 42:59.747
You can't look after them all that time.

43:02.458 --> 43:04.877
They need to be with their own kind,
raise families.

43:09.298 --> 43:13.719
Son, you saved their lives.
It was a wonderful thing that you did.

43:15.304 --> 43:16.972
It's nearly time to set them free.

43:26.232 --> 43:30.069
- When?
- When they can fly, I suppose.

43:30.236 --> 43:31.737
You still have to teach them.

43:32.863 --> 43:34.907
So they can survive when they go.

43:35.991 --> 43:38.452
Right now these birds think
everything comes from a bucket.

43:47.461 --> 43:49.463
See? It's easy.

43:51.799 --> 43:53.175
See? You want it?

43:54.343 --> 43:57.013
Yummy fishy. Now... Now you try.

43:57.179 --> 44:02.852
Okay? Now you... Now you got to drive
the little fishies into the shore, okay?

44:08.065 --> 44:10.443
Flap your wings.
You got to do it again, okay?

44:10.985 --> 44:13.404
Ready? Drive them into the shore.

44:16.615 --> 44:17.615
See?

44:19.118 --> 44:20.369
Yummy fishy.

44:28.753 --> 44:30.463
Try that again.

44:30.629 --> 44:31.881
He's a good boy.

44:33.257 --> 44:34.383
You're a lucky man.

44:40.973 --> 44:42.475
Why are you out here, Bill?

44:45.102 --> 44:46.270
The same as you.

44:49.023 --> 44:51.192
Didn't much like
what happened to me in the world.

44:59.492 --> 45:00.659
That's it, Mr Ponder.

45:03.204 --> 45:04.205
See, you get it.

45:06.248 --> 45:07.958
Yes, finally!

45:08.125 --> 45:09.877
Well done, Mr Ponder.

45:11.295 --> 45:13.589
Well done, Mr Percival. That's it.

45:14.382 --> 45:16.550
It worked, Dad. I got it.

45:17.718 --> 45:19.136
Good work, everyone.

45:23.140 --> 45:25.393
Pelican is <i>Ngatji.</i>

45:26.894 --> 45:27.894
My friend.

45:28.729 --> 45:30.106
They can teach you many things.

45:33.401 --> 45:37.113
Some say, long ago, they were men.

45:37.279 --> 45:40.366
Riding in canoes,
watching over everything.

45:40.533 --> 45:44.537
That's why there be a storm
if <i>Nori,</i> or pelican, is killed.

45:44.704 --> 45:47.331
See, <i>Nangai,</i> my father, told me,

45:47.498 --> 45:50.668
if you look after <i>Ngatji,
</i> then they will look after you.

47:04.241 --> 47:07.995
See? Just like that.
Then you start flying.

47:08.621 --> 47:09.872
Flap your wings.

47:12.875 --> 47:13.875
Wings out.

47:17.922 --> 47:19.590
Ready? Wings out.

47:19.757 --> 47:23.135
Ready? Come. Flap your wings.

47:23.302 --> 47:24.428
Come on.

47:24.595 --> 47:25.930
Flap your wings.

47:27.890 --> 47:29.100
Good job, Mr Proud!

47:30.893 --> 47:32.812
Ready? Like this.

47:32.978 --> 47:33.978
That's it.

47:36.440 --> 47:38.067
Flap your wings. Come on.

47:39.527 --> 47:41.862
That's it. Well done, Mr Ponder.

47:57.545 --> 47:59.130
How'd you go today?

47:59.296 --> 48:01.215
Mr Proud and Mr Ponder picked it up.

48:01.382 --> 48:03.342
Mr Percival will get it tomorrow.

48:04.301 --> 48:06.012
You must be a good teacher.

49:07.782 --> 49:09.867
I know you can do it, Mr Percival.

49:11.369 --> 49:12.703
Seen your brothers do it.

49:20.044 --> 49:21.044
Ready?

49:22.338 --> 49:25.758
Wings out. Flap. Flap. Flap.

49:25.925 --> 49:27.259
Good, go. Come on.

49:29.178 --> 49:32.181
Yes! Good job, Mr Percival.

50:16.142 --> 50:18.144
Can I hold Mr Percival?

50:19.979 --> 50:21.564
He won't go anywhere.

50:23.399 --> 50:24.399
Okay.

51:04.357 --> 51:07.151
All right. Let get this over with.

51:08.819 --> 51:11.447
Off you go now. Go on.

51:11.614 --> 51:13.407
It's time to look after yourselves.

51:14.367 --> 51:16.243
Off you go now. Go on.

51:16.952 --> 51:17.953
Off you go.

51:19.914 --> 51:20.956
Off you go.

51:34.887 --> 51:35.887
Michael.

51:41.060 --> 51:42.311
Goodbye.

51:43.521 --> 51:45.815
Lead the pack, Mr Percival.

51:48.192 --> 51:49.735
Look after yourself.

51:51.445 --> 51:52.445
Go on.

52:06.293 --> 52:07.293
Go on.

52:09.255 --> 52:10.256
Just go.

52:13.384 --> 52:15.594
What are you waiting for? Just go!

52:55.676 --> 52:59.096
I knew it.
I knew it was gonna end like this.

52:59.263 --> 53:02.308
Any story that's good has to go wrong
before it gets better.

53:02.475 --> 53:03.642
So does it?

53:08.522 --> 53:09.648
Wait here a tick.

53:33.964 --> 53:35.675
- Michael.
<i>- Are you on your way</i>

53:35.841 --> 53:37.968
- to the board meeting?
<i>- Shortly.</i>

53:38.135 --> 53:40.721
Just squeezing in
my weekly Zumba class.

53:40.888 --> 53:42.932
Oh, Cal, for heaven's sake.

53:43.099 --> 53:44.725
They say it's good for me.

53:44.892 --> 53:47.478
Listen, have you still got a copy
of the original charter?

53:47.645 --> 53:50.189
- The one we drew up for King Pastoral.
- Of course, I do.

53:50.815 --> 53:53.734
- Could you bring it into the meeting?
- What are you up to?

53:55.152 --> 53:56.862
- Just bring it.
<i>- Michael.</i>

53:57.029 --> 54:01.117
It takes three board members to initiate
any alteration to a meeting agenda.

54:01.283 --> 54:02.868
Can you talk to Julie?

54:03.035 --> 54:04.620
She always votes with Mal.

54:04.787 --> 54:06.664
I think he reminds her
of her dead husband.

54:06.831 --> 54:08.582
Talk to her, would you?

54:08.749 --> 54:09.750
<i>It's important.</i>

54:12.336 --> 54:14.922
- Is everything okay?
- I hope so.

54:17.800 --> 54:18.800
Where were we?

54:20.011 --> 54:21.137
The birds.

54:22.054 --> 54:23.054
You just let them go.

54:26.809 --> 54:29.020
I was as sad as I'd ever been.

54:31.897 --> 54:34.191
<i>I felt real loneliness</i>

54:34.358 --> 54:35.818
<i>for the first time.</i>

55:36.087 --> 55:38.005
I looked for Mr Percival today.

55:40.675 --> 55:42.301
You shouldn't be doing that.

55:43.052 --> 55:44.261
I didn't see him.

55:45.554 --> 55:46.722
None of them.

55:48.933 --> 55:50.810
But I saw the hunters.

55:50.976 --> 55:52.770
Not far from the nests.

55:54.438 --> 55:55.981
Don't worry, all right?

55:56.732 --> 55:59.902
Vote's next month. Bit of luck, we'll get
the point turned into a sanctuary.

56:04.532 --> 56:06.575
You said you didn't trust people
to be smart.

56:06.742 --> 56:07.952
I changed my mind.

56:15.251 --> 56:19.672
Drove cattle out here for jobs
and never looked back.

56:20.881 --> 56:21.966
What about the girl?

56:22.758 --> 56:24.301
Don't know what happened to her.

56:25.511 --> 56:26.846
But there was nothing I can do.

56:28.472 --> 56:30.683
She was promised to someone else.

56:32.018 --> 56:33.561
Gotta be respecting that.

56:34.895 --> 56:37.773
So I had to leave.

56:38.441 --> 56:41.485
Leave my family, leave everyone.

56:47.658 --> 56:48.909
I miss my father.

56:49.827 --> 56:50.827
My <i>Nangai.</i>

56:52.913 --> 56:54.373
<i>He was a tribal elder.</i>

57:01.130 --> 57:03.382
<i>He taught me everything
about the land.</i>

57:38.959 --> 57:40.127
I was married.

57:43.089 --> 57:44.089
We...

57:45.299 --> 57:48.219
We ran a petrol station,
on the outskirts of town.

57:49.679 --> 57:52.682
Just a temporary thing
while I got other plans sorted.

57:57.061 --> 57:58.521
We were having a picnic.

58:04.860 --> 58:07.279
<i>Jenny and Belle, my little girl.</i>

58:07.446 --> 58:10.825
<i>They... They went to get ice cream.</i>

58:14.745 --> 58:16.580
Weren't doing anything special.

58:20.918 --> 58:22.294
Jenny wasn't speeding.

58:31.929 --> 58:35.057
Sometimes I think it's best not
to have anyone to care about.

58:39.145 --> 58:40.688
That way you won't get hurt.

58:47.820 --> 58:51.032
Hell, I'd love to just go walkabout
like you fellas do.

58:54.326 --> 58:55.953
That can go pretty lonely.

58:58.539 --> 58:59.539
Sure enough, Tom.

59:35.785 --> 59:37.953
Dad! Dad! Dad!

59:38.120 --> 59:40.081
- What is it?
- It's Mr Percival.

59:40.247 --> 59:43.250
He came back. He can stay, can't he?

59:47.630 --> 59:50.257
Yeah, I suppose we can cope
with feeding one.

59:59.225 --> 01:00:03.020
<i>From that day on, Mr Percival refused
to ever leave my side.</i>

01:00:04.146 --> 01:00:05.856
<i>Not for an hour.</i>

01:00:06.023 --> 01:00:07.274
Not for a minute.

01:00:08.818 --> 01:00:09.818
Never.

01:00:59.243 --> 01:01:02.538
Okay, you stay here and I'll hide.
No peeking.

01:01:03.205 --> 01:01:04.832
Make sure he doesn't cheat.

01:01:04.999 --> 01:01:06.834
And count to 10 for him.

01:01:07.918 --> 01:01:10.588
One, two,

01:01:11.505 --> 01:01:14.925
three, four,

01:01:15.092 --> 01:01:17.303
five, six,

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:19.847
seven, eight, nine, 10.

01:01:20.014 --> 01:01:22.641
All right, Mr Percival, go find him.

01:01:22.808 --> 01:01:23.808
Go on.

01:01:52.088 --> 01:01:53.839
<i>He's in there.</i>

01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:12.733
You told him, Dad. You told him.

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.646
<i>This is Mum.</i>

01:02:52.023 --> 01:02:53.983
And that's Belle.

01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:58.112
I miss them.

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:06.746
I don't talk to Dad about it
because I know he misses them too.

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:10.416
There's nothing he can do about it.

01:03:18.007 --> 01:03:20.301
They would've liked you, Mr Percival.

01:03:22.553 --> 01:03:24.096
They would've like you a lot.

01:03:47.995 --> 01:03:51.624
- Vote no, people. Next Sunday.
- Vote no.

01:03:51.791 --> 01:03:54.251
- Vote no to the sanctuary.
- Vote no to the sanctuary, miss.

01:03:55.044 --> 01:03:56.962
Here you are, sir, for you.

01:03:58.923 --> 01:04:00.508
Here you go, Mr Percival.

01:04:21.654 --> 01:04:24.865
You trying to make a point?
Bringing that bird to town?

01:04:25.408 --> 01:04:26.826
What? No.

01:04:27.451 --> 01:04:30.663
Watch yourself, kid.
Bad things can happen, you know?

01:04:31.747 --> 01:04:32.790
Just like that.

01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:36.669
Don't say I didn't warn you. Come on.

01:04:36.836 --> 01:04:40.297
- Come on, boy, come on.
- Come on, Mr P, let's find Dad.

01:04:44.593 --> 01:04:46.137
No to the sanctuary, people.

01:05:44.612 --> 01:05:46.030
It's okay, Mr P.

01:05:47.948 --> 01:05:51.243
It's okay, Mr P. Stay here, Mr Percival.

01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:54.205
Stay, Mr Percival. Mr Percival!

01:05:54.372 --> 01:05:55.373
Stop, no!

01:06:09.178 --> 01:06:12.181
Stop! No! Mr Percival!

01:06:13.891 --> 01:06:14.891
Get out of it.

01:06:15.685 --> 01:06:18.354
- Mr Percival! Stop, no!
- Bloody bird!

01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:28.447
Look what you've done.

01:06:34.078 --> 01:06:35.246
Come on. Let's go.

01:07:07.403 --> 01:07:08.696
Dad.

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:26.816
There he is!

01:08:33.988 --> 01:08:35.282
No.

01:09:03.685 --> 01:09:04.685
Dad!

01:09:21.412 --> 01:09:22.537
Dad!

01:09:36.719 --> 01:09:38.054
Fingerbone, help me!

01:09:53.527 --> 01:09:54.653
Get the rope.

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.461
Mr Percival!

01:10:12.088 --> 01:10:13.673
Get down here now!

01:10:19.637 --> 01:10:21.389
Here. Here. See this?

01:10:21.555 --> 01:10:23.224
Take it to Dad. To Dad.

01:10:23.849 --> 01:10:26.310
To Dad. Come on. Dad needs you.

01:10:26.477 --> 01:10:28.062
Come on. Take it!

01:10:35.986 --> 01:10:37.446
Take it to Dad.

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:42.702
Go, Mr Percival! Take it to Dad!

01:11:01.679 --> 01:11:02.763
No!

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.520
Got it!

01:11:20.614 --> 01:11:21.615
Here, Mr P!

01:11:28.122 --> 01:11:29.498
Here, Fingerbone.

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:33.460
There you go.

01:11:57.818 --> 01:12:01.364
- Not much left. Hey! The rope!
- Fingerbone!

01:13:10.266 --> 01:13:11.350
Dad!

01:13:46.802 --> 01:13:48.012
I can't believe it.

01:13:49.388 --> 01:13:50.723
It was a miracle.

01:13:51.724 --> 01:13:53.851
My dad was saved by a pelican.

01:13:55.144 --> 01:13:56.479
So it all worked out?

01:13:58.105 --> 01:13:59.899
It's not over yet, Mads.

01:14:00.941 --> 01:14:02.234
What does that mean?

01:14:03.778 --> 01:14:05.488
I want to show you something.

01:14:08.532 --> 01:14:09.909
It's a bit of a hike.

01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:12.536
Are you going to the board meeting?

01:14:14.038 --> 01:14:15.373
No, I'm not.

01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:19.585
One thing you'll discover, Mads,

01:14:19.752 --> 01:14:22.880
sometimes you forget
the best things you ever learned.

01:14:23.047 --> 01:14:27.593
- Like how to live like a pelican.
- What happened after the storm?

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.722
Everything changed.
Word spread like you wouldn't believe.

01:14:31.889 --> 01:14:34.975
<i>Newspapers, radios.
They all picked up on the story.</i>

01:14:36.602 --> 01:14:38.604
<i>Mr Percival was famous.</i>

01:14:39.355 --> 01:14:41.649
<i>- So was I.
</i>-This way, Mr P.

01:14:53.202 --> 01:14:56.247
<i>Everyone in town was happy
for Mr Percival and me.</i>

01:14:58.624 --> 01:14:59.959
<i>Maybe not everyone.</i>

01:15:05.256 --> 01:15:10.386
A collection's been raised
to send your boy to St. Andrew's.

01:15:11.512 --> 01:15:13.431
Best boarding school in Australia.

01:15:15.307 --> 01:15:18.769
- Michael wouldn't wanna leave.
- It'd be good for him.

01:15:19.979 --> 01:15:21.564
A boy like that...

01:15:22.732 --> 01:15:24.650
he needs a proper education.

01:15:33.617 --> 01:15:35.828
- Malcolm.
- What the hell is going on?

01:15:35.995 --> 01:15:37.371
<i>I'm showing Maddie something.</i>

01:15:37.538 --> 01:15:40.291
The board are meeting in less
than an hour. I need you here now.

01:15:40.458 --> 01:15:42.710
Don't shout at me, Malcolm.
I'm a grown man.

01:15:42.877 --> 01:15:44.003
I'll do whatever I want.

01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:46.964
I've been on this deal for a year.
I don't need you to screw it up.

01:15:47.131 --> 01:15:49.175
Just call me when everyone's ready,

01:15:49.342 --> 01:15:51.552
put me on speaker
and I'll vote over the phone.

01:15:51.719 --> 01:15:55.556
- What are you up to, Michael?
- I'm trying to save your family.

01:16:02.563 --> 01:16:03.731
Grandpa.

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:05.775
Oh, my God.

01:16:05.941 --> 01:16:08.402
So are you coming?
Or do you have to go back to school?

01:16:09.487 --> 01:16:10.487
Are you kidding?

01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:35.971
- I'm not going!
- Think of it as an opportunity.

01:16:36.138 --> 01:16:38.349
I don't want an opportunity!
I want to stay here.

01:16:38.516 --> 01:16:41.811
I can't keep teaching you,
not the way you should be.

01:16:41.977 --> 01:16:45.773
- No, I'm staying here with you.
- It's a big world. There's a lot to do.

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:47.733
I don't care! I'm not going!

01:17:40.828 --> 01:17:42.288
Is this...?

01:17:44.623 --> 01:17:46.000
This is where we lived.

01:17:51.756 --> 01:17:53.007
What about the birds?

01:17:53.799 --> 01:17:55.843
The nesting area's way down there.

01:18:23.579 --> 01:18:25.039
Is that Mr Percival?

01:18:27.166 --> 01:18:28.167
No.

01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:31.087
Maybe one of his grandkids.

01:18:35.299 --> 01:18:36.717
I didn't understand it then,

01:18:36.884 --> 01:18:38.969
but I suppose my father was...

01:18:39.970 --> 01:18:42.473
only doing
what he thought was best for me.

01:18:46.268 --> 01:18:48.062
He's smart, Mr Percival.

01:18:51.315 --> 01:18:53.317
He needs an education.

01:18:53.484 --> 01:18:55.986
A life, you know? To...

01:18:57.655 --> 01:18:59.365
To show him there's more than this.

01:19:03.119 --> 01:19:05.579
Sometimes you got to do
what you know is right.

01:19:07.665 --> 01:19:09.417
Even if they're gonna hate you for it.

01:19:30.396 --> 01:19:32.773
- Malcolm.
- I have everyone here.

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.943
- Michael, are you ready to vote?
<i>- I am.</i>

01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:37.653
<i>Is Cal Evans there?</i>

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.824
- Jesus, Michael. Where are you?
<i>- I'm in the past, Cal.</i>

01:19:41.991 --> 01:19:43.075
Look at this.

01:19:44.493 --> 01:19:46.245
<i>I know I'm old.</i>

01:19:46.412 --> 01:19:49.582
<i>My mind's half shut,
but I still got a few teeth in my head.</i>

01:19:49.749 --> 01:19:52.293
<i>Did you manage to find
your copy of the original charter?</i>

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:53.961
- I did.
- What's going on?

01:19:54.128 --> 01:19:57.089
- Turn to page 27A.
- We're all ready for the vote.

01:19:57.256 --> 01:19:58.883
<i>Does it say under revision 18B</i>

01:19:59.050 --> 01:20:01.761
<i>that the board has the right
to delay any vote</i>

01:20:01.927 --> 01:20:04.263
so that an independent review
could be taken in the case

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:06.350
<i>- of exceptional circumstances?
</i>-What's going on?

01:20:06.474 --> 01:20:08.059
Yes. Yes, it does.

01:20:08.225 --> 01:20:10.728
If three board members agree.

01:20:10.895 --> 01:20:13.064
<i>So do we have three?</i>

01:20:23.991 --> 01:20:24.825
We do.

01:20:24.992 --> 01:20:27.828
What are you talking about?
There's no reason to delay the vote.

01:20:27.995 --> 01:20:29.997
<i>There are
no exceptional circumstances.</i>

01:20:30.164 --> 01:20:31.624
My granddaughter, your daughter,

01:20:31.791 --> 01:20:35.252
<i>who owns 25 percent
of your company, Malcolm,</i>

01:20:35.419 --> 01:20:38.297
<i>I'm afraid she's about
to have a nervous collapse.</i>

01:20:38.464 --> 01:20:40.341
What? No, she's not.

01:20:40.508 --> 01:20:41.592
<i>Oh, yes, I am.</i>

01:20:41.759 --> 01:20:44.011
It's a serious collapse. Very, very bad.

01:20:44.178 --> 01:20:47.431
<i>- I'd call that exceptional circumstances.
- So would I.</i>

01:20:47.598 --> 01:20:50.267
<i>- We need to postpone the vote.
- Get her off the phone, Michael.</i>

01:20:50.434 --> 01:20:53.604
<i>This will make no difference.
I'll still win the vote after the review.</i>

01:20:53.771 --> 01:20:55.731
You may. Or you may not.

01:20:55.898 --> 01:20:59.235
But if we can delay it a bit longer,
Maddie will be 18 by then

01:20:59.402 --> 01:21:02.863
<i>and sitting on the board,
and she can argue against you.</i>

01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:06.283
- Give people time to reconsider.
<i>- They don't wanna reconsider.</i>

01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:09.412
- No one wants to reconsider.
<i>- We got to go, Mal.</i>

01:21:09.578 --> 01:21:11.914
<i>We'll see you at that dinner
we were planning for Sonia.</i>

01:21:12.081 --> 01:21:15.167
No, no, you're breaking up. Ciao!

01:21:15.334 --> 01:21:16.334
Michael!

01:21:20.047 --> 01:21:21.716
Grandpa, that was amazing.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.385
We've delayed him for a while,

01:21:24.552 --> 01:21:27.054
but it's gonna be up to you
to change his mind.

01:21:27.221 --> 01:21:29.932
- He'll be lucky if I talk to him for a year.
- No, no.

01:21:31.017 --> 01:21:33.436
You have to talk to him.
He's your father.

01:21:34.603 --> 01:21:35.646
Don't I know it.

01:21:36.772 --> 01:21:41.068
He's not a bad man.
He's just a businessman.

01:21:42.695 --> 01:21:44.196
And your mum, she loved him.

01:21:52.955 --> 01:21:56.500
I never really made peace
with my father after we fought.

01:21:58.836 --> 01:22:00.504
I never came back here.

01:22:05.718 --> 01:22:07.845
I made that decision in anger.

01:22:10.389 --> 01:22:12.641
It was the biggest mistake of my life.

01:22:14.977 --> 01:22:17.229
I don't want you to go down that path.

01:22:21.025 --> 01:22:25.112
- Well, I like being angry.
- Mads, there's no future in that.

01:22:27.031 --> 01:22:28.532
Think about it, will you?

01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:31.827
You have to. It's so important.

01:22:35.039 --> 01:22:36.082
All right.

01:22:37.166 --> 01:22:38.250
I'll talk to him.

01:22:57.895 --> 01:23:00.773
Grandpa? What about Mr Percival?

01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:53.325
Don't you wanna say goodbye
to Mr Percival?

01:23:58.456 --> 01:24:00.916
Just give it a month, see how you go.

01:24:04.253 --> 01:24:05.254
Come on, then.

01:24:32.865 --> 01:24:34.367
Mr Percival?

01:24:35.743 --> 01:24:37.453
Mr Percival, stop. No!

01:24:54.011 --> 01:24:56.514
Mr Percival! Come back!

01:25:01.102 --> 01:25:02.103
Michael!

01:25:17.743 --> 01:25:18.869
No!

01:25:25.459 --> 01:25:27.962
That's Mr Percival!

01:25:28.129 --> 01:25:29.129
Stop!

01:25:34.301 --> 01:25:36.762
Stop! That's Mr Percival!

01:25:40.391 --> 01:25:41.684
Whoa, buddy.

01:25:48.983 --> 01:25:51.193
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

01:25:59.076 --> 01:26:00.369
He attacked me.

01:26:02.413 --> 01:26:03.622
You saw him.

01:26:04.498 --> 01:26:06.292
I had no choice.

01:26:06.459 --> 01:26:07.960
I warned you!

01:26:19.013 --> 01:26:20.514
They shot him, Dad.

01:26:22.558 --> 01:26:24.643
- Give him to me. Let me carry him.
- No!

01:26:26.937 --> 01:26:29.106
I wasn't there to protect him.

01:26:31.150 --> 01:26:32.568
This is your fault!

01:27:44.015 --> 01:27:45.808
You're the best friend I ever had.

01:27:57.528 --> 01:27:58.863
Please don't die.

01:28:10.958 --> 01:28:11.958
Don't...

01:28:13.252 --> 01:28:14.252
die.

01:28:16.505 --> 01:28:18.132
I know why you did it.

01:29:46.804 --> 01:29:48.180
I'm ready to go now.

01:30:48.949 --> 01:30:50.284
Is that how it ended?

01:30:51.827 --> 01:30:54.246
Mr Percival's life wasn't in vain.

01:30:55.289 --> 01:30:59.502
After I'd gone to school, the council
heard what the hunters had done.

01:31:00.711 --> 01:31:02.546
They doubled the size of the sanctuary.

01:31:04.090 --> 01:31:07.551
Twenty thousand acres,
the largest in the southern hemisphere.

01:31:09.011 --> 01:31:11.222
They gave it a lease for 100 years...

01:31:12.515 --> 01:31:14.433
with an option to extend.

01:31:32.201 --> 01:31:33.869
Is that Mr Percival?

01:31:34.954 --> 01:31:35.955
Yes.

01:31:40.209 --> 01:31:43.170
A bird like him never dies.

01:31:47.466 --> 01:31:48.466
Come on.

01:32:42.521 --> 01:32:44.273
I have something for you.

01:33:00.790 --> 01:33:01.791
Thank you.

01:33:05.419 --> 01:33:07.588
I think I'll just sit here for a bit.

01:33:28.609 --> 01:33:30.027
What does that mean?

01:33:32.238 --> 01:33:33.864
It means "Storm Boy."
