So, Ron...

you're just going
to chill all summer?

00:11.712 --> 00:14.713
Chillin', as you put it,
is for amateurs, Kim.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.215
I'm marinating.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.683
Marinating?

00:17.685 --> 00:20.953
Marinating... relaxation
for the professional.

00:20.955 --> 00:22.121
Ready to roll, Kimmie?

00:22.123 --> 00:24.690
Roll? No one said anything
about rolling.

my Uncle Slim.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.827
Okay. I'll be here
when you get back.

00:28.829 --> 00:29.828

Okay, well, I'll be here
when you get back.

Well, Jos is going

What kind of phase?

She's got herself a hero
that she absolutely idolizes.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.185
Ah, it's great to have heroes.

Man, could that guy
build spacecraft.

when I was Jos's age.

every one of Kim's adventures,

08:17.464 --> 08:19.731
so I know how many times
you saved the day.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.600
I'm always right there.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.568
The guy with the pocket
that Rufus comes out of.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.237
Uh, oh, yeah.

08:25.239 --> 08:26.671
You're the one who's always
losing his drawers.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.608
Oh, come on. It's only
been six or eight times.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.477
Sent a little bird up
a couple of years ago,

08:32.479 --> 08:34.579
so I got an eye
on the whole spread.

08:34.581 --> 08:37.048
Oh, satellite, huh?

08:37.050 --> 08:38.783
So, I guess you could
take a look at the, uh...

08:38.785 --> 08:39.784
Crooked D?

08:39.786 --> 08:41.353
Yeah. You know,

08:41.355 --> 08:42.721
where all those
tinhorn brainiacs are.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.623
You know, Squirt,
I'm pretty handy

08:44.625 --> 08:46.358
with the cutting-edge
tech myself,

08:46.360 --> 08:48.026
but I'm nowhere near
as smart as you.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.762
Now, Slim, I'm...
I'm not that smart.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.631
Of course you are
and you know it.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.633
Doesn't matter
who else knows it.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.302
I'd just like to know who put
together that guest list.

08:57.304 --> 09:02.574
DR. DRAKKEN: Ladies and gentlemen,
you may now put on your hats

09:02.576 --> 09:06.444
and become official
buckaroos and buckarettes.

09:06.446 --> 09:08.113
Yippee-kai-yay!

09:08.115 --> 09:09.648
My own ten-liter hat.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.217
I'm most eager to rope them up
and ride them out.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.752
( <i>high-pitched crackling</i> )

09:13.754 --> 09:16.721
♪ The farmer in the dell,
the farmer in the dell ♪

09:16.723 --> 09:18.823
♪ Hi-ho the derry-o,
the farmer in the dell. ♪

09:18.825 --> 09:20.592
I love these cowboy songs.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.728
( <i>whooping,</i>
<i>country music playing</i> )

09:29.735 --> 09:31.636
Wow, they're acting
so... so...

09:31.638 --> 09:33.204
Silly?

09:33.206 --> 09:35.307
Not the word I would
choose, but okay.

09:35.309 --> 09:37.576
It's because they are wearing
my new invention,

09:37.578 --> 09:40.178
the silly hat.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.813
( <i>singing gibberish</i> )

09:41.815 --> 09:45.250
Anyone who wears one of these
hats will act as silly as...

09:45.252 --> 09:45.950
Your outfit?

09:45.952 --> 09:49.554
I happen to feel <i>muy</i> macho,
thank you very much.

09:49.556 --> 09:53.758
Anyway, with the world's most
brilliant people incapacitated...

09:53.760 --> 09:55.293
You start looking pretty smart.

09:55.295 --> 09:58.396
I will be the greatest mind
on the planet

09:58.398 --> 10:02.400
because the rest will be
reduced to babbling buffoons.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.703
( <i>laughing uncontrollably</i> )

10:07.607 --> 10:09.274
KIM:
<i>Well, I hate to brag,</i>

10:09.276 --> 10:10.742
but it was pretty exciting

10:10.744 --> 10:13.445
that time Drakken had
a giant laser drill.

10:13.447 --> 10:14.746
Inside the world's
largest cheese drill,

10:14.748 --> 10:16.348
which was not
a cheese-cutter building.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.582
It was actually made of cheese.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.150
Yeah, that time.

10:19.152 --> 10:20.819
You know all about
that mission, huh?

10:20.821 --> 10:22.187
Hey! Here I am, see,

10:22.189 --> 10:23.421
when we busted Duff Killagan
in Tokyo.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.323
That's me, in the background
there, see?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.424
Huh, no.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.193
Sorry.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.828
Wh... Oh, you're right.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.496
Yeah, it's
a Japanese schoolgirl.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.598
Here's one I usually
don't talk about,

10:33.600 --> 10:35.367
but since you're such a fan...

10:35.369 --> 10:38.169
There was this top-secret thing
called the Centurion Project...

10:38.171 --> 10:40.605
Which Drakken and Killagan
wanted, but it got stuck on you

10:40.607 --> 10:42.507
and whenever you lied,
the Centurion Battler

10:42.509 --> 10:44.142
would grow and spread
all over your body.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.844
Boy, howdy.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.913
I bet that's a Halloween nobody
in Middleton will ever forget.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.515
Was that Halloween?

10:50.517 --> 10:52.350
I thought that was our big
Groundhog's Day adventure.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.318
How about when Shego...

10:53.320 --> 10:54.653
Tutored Señor Senior, Jr.

10:54.655 --> 10:55.820
on how to be a bad guy?

10:55.822 --> 10:56.855
Or when Drakken...

10:56.857 --> 10:57.856
Stole a weather machine?

10:57.858 --> 10:59.391
Uh, you know what?

10:59.393 --> 11:00.792
Let's forget about me
for a minute.

11:00.794 --> 11:01.960
Let's talk about you.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.728
Sure.
What are you into?

11:03.730 --> 11:04.663
You.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.398
O...kay.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.599
I'm going to mosey
somewhere else.

11:07.601 --> 11:08.667
Later.

11:08.669 --> 11:10.168
Let's go outside
and do something.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.169
You got it!

11:11.171 --> 11:12.370
Here's an idea.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.905
Why don't you decide what we do?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.474
I have got a great idea.

11:16.476 --> 11:17.776
Excellent.
What do you want to do?

11:17.778 --> 11:18.810
Whatever you want to do.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.612
Oh...

11:29.188 --> 11:30.388
Just a few adjustments

11:30.390 --> 11:32.223
to the satellite
surveillance system and...

11:32.225 --> 11:33.458
Whatcha doing,
Mr. Doctor P.?

11:33.460 --> 11:35.393
Um, uh, not spying
on the Wild West

11:35.395 --> 11:37.429
Science Fest,
I can tell you that.

11:37.431 --> 11:38.730
Hey, isn't that your old pal,

11:38.732 --> 11:39.564
Professor Ramish?

11:39.566 --> 11:40.832
It is.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.567
That is one strange
square dance.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.302
I bet it's a
square-root dance.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.570
Which is, what?

11:45.572 --> 11:47.272
I don't know,
but it's the sort of thing

11:47.274 --> 11:48.640
the smartest people
in the world would do

11:48.642 --> 11:49.641
if they all got together.

11:49.643 --> 11:51.443
I don't care
if I wasn't invited,

11:51.445 --> 11:53.478
I'm going over to the Crooked D.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.413
Count me in. It's gotta
be better than hanging out

11:55.415 --> 11:57.215
with the Never-Heard
of-Ron Fan Club.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.784
I mean, I know
Dr. Drakken is your archfoe,

11:59.786 --> 12:03.021
but it seems to me, Shego's
the really dangerous one.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.457
I mean, if she
put her mind to do it,

12:05.459 --> 12:07.992
she could be the toughest
villain out there.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.327
Don't you think? Kim?

12:09.329 --> 12:10.595
Kim?

12:10.597 --> 12:12.831
Kim!!

12:12.833 --> 12:13.965
Wade?

12:13.967 --> 12:14.999
Hey, Kim. Please tell me

12:15.001 --> 12:16.301
that someone, somewhere

12:16.303 --> 12:17.402
needs me to do something.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.536
What's the static?

12:18.538 --> 12:20.638
My little cousin
is my number one fan.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.906
Aw, how sweet.

12:21.908 --> 12:22.874
Well, at first,

12:22.876 --> 12:24.409
but I can't take it anymore.

12:24.411 --> 12:25.810
She won't leave me alone.

12:25.812 --> 12:26.910
That's the price of fame.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.646
You won't believe
what it's like for <i>me</i>

12:28.648 --> 12:30.248
when I go to the computer store.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.583
I wonder where
she could have got to.

12:31.585 --> 12:32.617
KIM:
I'm serious, Wade.

12:32.619 --> 12:33.818
She's so got to get a life.

12:33.820 --> 12:34.953
Preferably her own.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.254
( <i>gasps</i>)

12:36.256 --> 12:37.522
Oh, no.

12:38.324 --> 12:39.257
She heard you?

12:39.259 --> 12:40.425
( <i>door slams</i> )

12:40.427 --> 12:41.493
She so heard me.

12:41.495 --> 12:44.996
( <i>whooping</i> )

12:46.832 --> 12:47.999
Something's not right.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.400
They're acting like
a bunch of goofs.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.969
Dr. P.,
sometimes you have

12:50.971 --> 12:52.003
to let your hair down.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.304
You got to get loose.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.539
( <i>raspberries</i>)

12:54.541 --> 12:57.876
( <i>idiotic giggling</i>)

12:57.878 --> 12:58.877
You know what?

12:58.879 --> 12:59.978
Maybe some boundaries

12:59.980 --> 13:01.446
are being crossed here.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.569
What is wrong with you, man?

13:04.583 --> 13:05.884
( <i>slurping</i>)

13:05.886 --> 13:07.485
What's going on down there?

13:07.487 --> 13:08.887
Looks like trouble.

13:08.889 --> 13:09.921
Better report it fast.

13:09.923 --> 13:10.989
Hombre One to Drakken.

13:10.991 --> 13:11.990
We have varmints.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.458
DRAKKEN:
We have what?

13:13.460 --> 13:14.993
Varmints? What is a varmint?

13:14.995 --> 13:16.795
Shego! Here... you
speak Hombre.

13:16.797 --> 13:17.796
Give me that.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.364
Howdy, Hombre.

13:19.366 --> 13:22.534
What in tarnation is a-goin' on?

13:24.470 --> 13:27.305
Looks like we got us
some varmints.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.840
What does that mean?!

13:28.842 --> 13:31.676
Hey. Um...
I'm sorry.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.045
I mean, it-it was so nice
that you picked me

13:34.047 --> 13:35.880
to be your hero, and I end up

13:35.882 --> 13:37.015
being a total jerk.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.349
It's not your fault.

13:38.351 --> 13:39.584
It is. It really is.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.819
I mean, well, you're...

13:40.821 --> 13:42.487
Just a nobody,

13:42.489 --> 13:44.856
stuck here
in the middle of nowhere.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.457
Jos, I was just a nobody.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.892
I mean, not a <i>nobody.</i>

13:47.894 --> 13:49.894
Nobody's a nobody.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.329
Everybody's somebody. Right?

13:51.331 --> 13:52.897
Is this supposed
to make me feel better?

13:52.899 --> 13:54.732
I'm just a regular person.

13:54.734 --> 13:57.869
I'm into cheerleading
and boys... sometimes.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.604
You know, regular stuff.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.139
You do incredible stuff.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.740
You save the world.

14:02.742 --> 14:05.743
Jos, I'm just, you know, me.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.378
That's all I ever try to be,

14:07.380 --> 14:09.113
and it turned out
that sometimes being me

14:09.115 --> 14:10.648
is enough to save the world.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.985
Yeah, and that's why
being you is so cool.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.387
Try being you...
it'll be even cooler.

14:16.389 --> 14:17.622
Doubt it.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.490
Kim, you'd best get down here!

14:20.392 --> 14:21.359
BOTH:
What's the sitch?

14:21.361 --> 14:22.360
Oops. Sorry.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.362
No big.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.597
Ron and Dad?

14:25.599 --> 14:26.764
Captured by Shego.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.000
That means your archfoe
is next door.

14:29.002 --> 14:30.535
Spankin'!

14:30.537 --> 14:32.737
Jos, it is not spankin'.
It's serious.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.939
But nothing ever
happens around here.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.140
This is major!

14:36.142 --> 14:37.709
That's what I'm afraid of.

14:37.711 --> 14:38.943
So!

14:38.945 --> 14:40.945
We've got a new team here.

14:40.947 --> 14:43.014
The genius and the lackwit.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.749
Don't let him
call you a lackwit.

14:44.751 --> 14:47.018
Whatever your evil scheme
is, Lipsky, it won't work.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.020
Uh-huh, but it already has,

14:49.022 --> 14:52.457
and all prisoners will refer
to me as Dr. Drakken.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.459
You'll always just
be Drew Lipsky,

14:54.461 --> 14:56.761
the science student who
couldn't make the grade.

14:56.763 --> 14:57.962
I will now.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.397
You see, Possible,

14:59.399 --> 15:01.699
I've adjusted the curve.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.935
You gathered the greatest
minds on the planet here,

15:03.937 --> 15:05.737
so you could alter
their intelligence

15:05.739 --> 15:07.171
and make yourself seem smarter.

15:07.173 --> 15:08.706
Aha!

15:08.708 --> 15:09.874
How's he doing that?

15:09.876 --> 15:12.477
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.045
It's obviously
those cowboy hats.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.414
They probably contain
some hidden circuitry

15:16.416 --> 15:18.182
that alters brain
wave efficacy.

15:18.184 --> 15:21.019
You Possibles take
the fun out of everything.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.620
Yeah, well,
it runs in the family.

15:22.622 --> 15:25.023
There's a Possible posse
heading into town.

15:27.059 --> 15:30.862
( <i>horses whinnying</i> )

15:30.864 --> 15:32.764
Looks like they're expecting us.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.465
Oh, that's a passel of hombres.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.500
Can we take them?

15:35.502 --> 15:36.734
Got to remember, Jos...

15:36.736 --> 15:38.770
BOTH: Anything's
possible for a Possible.

15:38.772 --> 15:41.105
Let's ride.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.074
( <i>whistles</i> )

15:43.076 --> 15:44.509
( <i>whinnying</i> )

15:46.578 --> 15:48.179
Hick-a-bick-a-boo!

15:48.181 --> 15:49.480
Yee-haw!

15:57.222 --> 15:59.924
You know what's nice
about robot horses, partner?

16:00.793 --> 16:02.026
Magna hooves.

16:10.102 --> 16:11.903
Oh!

16:11.905 --> 16:12.937
( <i>grunts</i> )

16:12.939 --> 16:15.540
( <i>growls</i>)

16:25.884 --> 16:27.018
( <i>whinnies</i> )

16:43.769 --> 16:44.836
( <i>grunts</i> )

17:02.921 --> 17:04.122
( <i>growls</i>)

17:15.901 --> 17:17.035
Hang on, Jos.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.836
I'll bust out Dad and Ron.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.772
( <i>whinnies</i> )

17:30.049 --> 17:32.116
So not the drama. Oh!

17:36.889 --> 17:38.823
Thanks, kid.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.591
Couldn't have done it
better myself.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.869
Oh, this is all my fault.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.037
Well, little darling,

17:53.039 --> 17:54.872
now, you can't
just go imitating

17:54.874 --> 17:57.041
everything you see
Cousin Kim doing.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.676
Don't blame yourself, Jos.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.211
It's my fault for
being such a nosy Parker.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.279
Dad.

18:01.281 --> 18:02.713
Kim, the man is a nosy Parker.

18:02.715 --> 18:03.781
Ron.
Fear not.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.250
We've got this escape
in the pocket.

18:09.955 --> 18:11.789
Gotcha.

18:13.058 --> 18:14.892
( <i>groans</i>) Rufus.

18:14.894 --> 18:15.693
Kangaroo rat.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.298
He did it!

18:21.133 --> 18:23.067
( <i>alarm blaring</i> )

18:29.842 --> 18:30.975
( <i>all groan</i> )

18:30.977 --> 18:31.976
( <i>alarm stops</i>)

18:31.978 --> 18:33.744
You actually fell for the old

18:33.746 --> 18:35.847
key-near-
the-cell-door ruse?

18:35.849 --> 18:38.049
And you're not even
wearing the silly hats.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.217
Good hustle anyway, buddy.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.651
I just want to know one thing

18:40.653 --> 18:42.186
about your evil plan, Lipsky.

18:42.188 --> 18:45.189
Well, I do like to gloat about
the nuances of my schemes.

18:45.191 --> 18:46.224
Fire away.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.258
If you gathered

18:47.260 --> 18:48.993
the greatest minds
on the planet,

18:48.995 --> 18:50.194
why did you leave me out?

18:50.196 --> 18:52.096
Because you're a Possible.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.764
You people are such pests!

18:53.766 --> 18:54.832
Yep.
(beeping)

18:54.834 --> 18:56.000
What was that?

18:56.002 --> 18:57.001
What?
That boop, boop.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.336
Oh, that.
'Tweren't nothing.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.905
That was just me
activating Old Tornado.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.140
Is that all?

19:02.142 --> 19:03.774
Well, never
mind that... Wait.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.144
Who is Old Tornado?

19:06.146 --> 19:08.646
( <i>whinnies</i> )

19:08.648 --> 19:09.914
That's my big brother.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.082
Good horsey.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.885
What's he doing?

19:15.821 --> 19:17.421
( <i>panicked yelling</i> )

19:17.423 --> 19:19.390
See, the little pony
outside Smarty Mart

19:19.392 --> 19:20.424
could never do that.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.093
Yep, Old Tornado

19:22.095 --> 19:23.094
is one of a kind.

19:23.096 --> 19:25.696
Come on. Let's get Drakken.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.798
Oh, I'll take that.

19:28.133 --> 19:29.133
Whoa!

19:29.135 --> 19:30.067
Hang on, Ron.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.036
( <i>Ron yelling</i>)

19:32.038 --> 19:33.971
Horsey, come back!

19:33.973 --> 19:35.873
This is good-time fun.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.875
Give me the remote, Shego.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.044
I don't think so,
and if you come any closer,

19:40.046 --> 19:42.046
your sidekick gets bucked
into the next county.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.014
Can you do anything?

19:43.016 --> 19:44.015
Nope.
Afraid of that.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.216
Now!
Now!

19:47.219 --> 19:48.920
What? I...

19:48.922 --> 19:50.121
( <i>straining</i> )

19:51.256 --> 19:52.323
No fair.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.457
( <i>Ron yelling</i>)

19:57.963 --> 19:59.797
Uh-uh-uh.

19:59.799 --> 20:00.765
Oh, no.

20:05.971 --> 20:06.938
That's original.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.241
Whoa!

20:10.243 --> 20:11.876
That was radical.

20:11.878 --> 20:14.178
Thanks. Just doing
the Jos thing.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.314
Whoa-whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.381
( <i>whinny halts</i>)

20:17.383 --> 20:18.349
Huh?

20:18.351 --> 20:19.951
Huh?
I'll take that.

20:21.253 --> 20:22.353
What did you say to it?

20:22.355 --> 20:24.222
Oh, nothing.
I just knew there was

20:24.224 --> 20:25.256
an off switch back here.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.458
See? I couldn't
have done that.

20:30.429 --> 20:31.929
Dr. D.,

20:31.931 --> 20:34.098
I'd say it's about
time to vamoose.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.234
We need something big
to cover our escape.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.468
I've got it!

20:39.905 --> 20:41.172
Stampede!

20:41.174 --> 20:43.274
( <i>gibbering</i> )

20:43.276 --> 20:44.809
No, seriously, fellows.

20:44.811 --> 20:47.011
A stampede would be
very helpful here.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.946
Allow me.

21:12.337 --> 21:14.272
Huh. That there
is dang weird.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.506
Dad!

21:20.879 --> 21:22.113
Possible?

21:22.115 --> 21:23.414
What's this all about?

21:23.838 --> 21:24.449
Silly hat.

21:24.450 --> 21:26.951
( <i>high-pitched crackling</i> )

21:29.554 --> 21:31.022
Well, Squirt, did you

21:31.024 --> 21:32.290
work up an appetite?

21:32.292 --> 21:33.991
Yes, I am hankering
for some grub,

21:33.993 --> 21:35.393
I'll tell you what.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.028
Maybe you're not
such a tinhorn after all.

21:37.030 --> 21:38.229
Hey, where's Jos?

21:38.231 --> 21:39.263
Haven't seen her in a while.

21:39.265 --> 21:40.231
Me neither.

21:40.233 --> 21:41.532
She was bending Ronald's ear

21:41.534 --> 21:42.800
about something.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.402
Are you guys ready to eat?

21:46.138 --> 21:47.238
Oh, boy.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.406
Kim, I just figured out

21:48.408 --> 21:50.508
who the real hero is
around here.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.876
Ron?
Totally.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.144
It's hard to argue.

21:53.146 --> 21:55.413
Ron here is afraid of
practically everything.

21:55.415 --> 21:58.249
But does he let his fears keep
him from sidekicking?

21:58.251 --> 21:59.350
I do not.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.418
Attaboy.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.552
Let's face it, Kim,

22:01.554 --> 22:02.987
you can do anything,

22:02.989 --> 22:05.156
so facing all those
dangers and villains,

22:05.158 --> 22:07.158
well, it's just like
you say... no big.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.060
Well, uh, I guess.

22:09.062 --> 22:11.028
A fellow filled
with that much fear

22:11.030 --> 22:13.130
always charging
into action with you?

22:13.132 --> 22:16.233
Seems to me that's a true hero.

22:16.235 --> 22:17.335
I can tell she's a Possible.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.936
Mm-hmm!
Smart as a whip, this kid.
