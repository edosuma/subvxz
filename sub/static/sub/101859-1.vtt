Good. I'm so glad
you enjoyed it.

10:40.307 --> 10:41.906
We're doing a special
hanukkah menu.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.041
Oh.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.242
David is a food critic.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.511
We like to get his opinion
before we serve anything new.

10:46.546 --> 10:48.113
Oh, a food critic?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.014
Yeah.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.716
David singer.
He's pretty well-known.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.717
I know the name.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.519
Well, it's nice to know

10:54.554 --> 10:55.687
that people
are reading what I write.

10:55.722 --> 10:57.055
Yeah, I've read
every single word.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.123
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.091
Christina
has a restaurant, too.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.426
Dolce angelo, in cleveland.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.129
You just... You wrote a review,

11:04.164 --> 11:05.930
and you just said the food
was predictable.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.799
Well, I also said
it was very good.

11:07.834 --> 11:10.235
I just wanted to be
a little bit more surprised.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.703
Yeah, yeah, totally.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.038
Faint praise.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.206
I'm going to go
check on those latkes.

11:15.242 --> 11:16.875
-Okay.
-It was so nice meeting you.

11:16.910 --> 11:17.909
Yeah, you too.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.444
He's really nice.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.112
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:23.116 --> 11:26.251
All right, so for hanukkah,
we're doing eight crazy latkes.

11:26.286 --> 11:30.722
Uh, so, we've got
the holy guacalatke,

11:30.757 --> 11:34.559
and we've also added
the whole enchilatke.

11:34.594 --> 11:36.494
Uh-huh.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.462
I want you
to try this one first.

11:37.497 --> 11:38.463
-Okay.
-So, go ahead.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.397
Tell me what you think.

11:42.836 --> 11:43.768
It's good.

11:43.804 --> 11:44.602
Yeah?

11:44.638 --> 11:46.071
Try adding a little
pico de gallo.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.306
Pico de gallo.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.041
Not just a shayna punim.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.646
Yeah. Yeah.

11:54.681 --> 11:56.815
Like, what's the deal,
what's the family dynamic?

11:56.850 --> 11:58.249
You know what,
I love them...

11:58.285 --> 11:59.918
I don't got any pico,
but I got some hot sauce.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.119
Let's do it.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.954
Lenny was my dad.

12:02.989 --> 12:06.091
He passed away a few years ago.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.327
Sports and food
were his two favorite things,

12:09.362 --> 12:11.629
so he found a way
to combine them.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.934
Same with me.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.268
My mom, she passed away,

12:17.304 --> 12:19.037
um, and then now

12:19.072 --> 12:21.473
I'm running the restaurant
that I grew up in, so...

12:22.843 --> 12:24.275
I...

12:24.311 --> 12:26.177
I just can't believe
how much we have in common.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.780
I know, it's...
It's crazy.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.551
My mom's in st. Louis,
but she gets back tomorrow.

12:33.587 --> 12:34.619
I hope she can
fill in the blanks

12:34.654 --> 12:35.787
about how we're related.

12:35.822 --> 12:36.955
Mm-hmm.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.523
Hey, why don't you
come to brunch?

12:40.393 --> 12:41.626
Only if I can bring dessert.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.329
My mom will be thrilled

12:44.364 --> 12:45.830
to meet another member
of the family.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.408
Hi, mom!

12:57.444 --> 12:59.344
Hey.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.412
There are only four days
till hanukkah,

13:01.448 --> 13:04.149
and I... I have so much to do.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.417
That's a really nice one, mom.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.386
Yes, I got it from
a collector in st. Louis.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.454
It looks just like one

13:09.489 --> 13:12.023
that my grandmother gave me
when I was a child.

13:12.058 --> 13:14.859
Well, who knows,
maybe it's the same one.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.562
That's what I told leslie,
the collector,

13:17.597 --> 13:21.266
yes, to explain why I was
crying over a dreidel.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.500
I invited someone to brunch

13:22.536 --> 13:24.502
I met on one of
those ancestry sites.

13:24.538 --> 13:25.403
Oh, today?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.404
Yeah, I hope it's okay.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.606
Christina lost her mom recently.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.009
She was a chef,
and so is christina.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.911
Now she's running
their restaurant on her own,

13:32.946 --> 13:34.112
just like me and scott.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.381
Well, I look forward
to meeting her.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.282
Are the kids going to be here?

13:37.317 --> 13:39.217
No, no, phil
took molly to ballet class

13:39.252 --> 13:40.618
and max to hockey practice.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.387
All right, well, come on,

13:42.422 --> 13:43.721
help me
get the food ready.

13:43.757 --> 13:44.856
Okay, of course.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.438
Hi.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.106
What are you doing here?

14:02.142 --> 14:03.575
Staying here
over the holidays.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.243
-Oh.
-Is that going to be a problem?

14:06.580 --> 14:07.579
Not a problem.

14:07.614 --> 14:08.780
'cause I could eat in my room.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.081
Let's not make it a thing.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.115
Fine by me.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.184
Good.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.054
Great.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.895
I brought... Cannolis.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.430
Okay.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.998
Mm-hmm.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.100
They are for dessert.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.335
They are not for review.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.437
If the cannolis
are predictable,

14:32.472 --> 14:33.805
I'll keep it to myself.

14:33.840 --> 14:36.941
Hmm.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.643
You might even like them.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.681
This is my mom, ruth.

14:43.717 --> 14:45.516
Oh, so nice to meet you.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.018
Hi. I made cannolis.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.586
You made these yourself?

14:48.622 --> 14:50.288
Yeah, just an
old family recipe.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.422
Oh, yeah.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.657
Becky told me
your mom was a chef.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.425
Yeah. Yeah.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.661
And this place, it's beautiful.

14:56.696 --> 14:57.862
Aw, thank you.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.764
We're getting ready
for hanukkah.

14:59.799 --> 15:00.965
It's my favorite time
of the year.

15:01.001 --> 15:02.667
I hope you're hungry.

15:02.702 --> 15:03.768
-Yes.
-I am.

15:03.803 --> 15:06.104
He eats enough for an army
and never gains weight.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.171
It isn't fair.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.640
I run five miles a day.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.275
Yeah, and I run after two kids.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.809
And you'd never guess
how close they are.

15:11.845 --> 15:14.178
Uh, do you have any brothers
or sisters?

15:14.214 --> 15:15.813
No, it's just me.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.181
Well, if you're going
to meet relatives online,

15:17.217 --> 15:18.816
you couldn't do better
than this family.

15:20.387 --> 15:21.719
-Thanks, david.
-Shucks. Stop it.

15:21.755 --> 15:25.023
Well, let's see how
she feels after brunch.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.225
-You just did. Yes, you did.
-Did I?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.227
So, uh... So becky tells me

15:29.262 --> 15:31.629
that you and david
have a history.

15:31.665 --> 15:34.499
Oh, yes, a short one,
about half a page.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.633
This guy wrote

15:35.669 --> 15:38.870
that, uh, my lasagna
was predictable.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.371
-No.
-David...

15:40.407 --> 15:41.839
Did you really say that?

15:41.875 --> 15:43.708
I... I...
Honestly, I can't remember.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.243
-[laughing]
-I don't remember.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.911
David's on his way
to europe...

15:46.947 --> 15:50.581
Yep, to, uh, try great food
and write about it.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.317
Aw, I want your life.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.152
Well, I'm leaving on the first,

15:54.187 --> 15:56.487
so I'm kind of camping out here
until I take off...

15:56.523 --> 15:57.922
Which is lucky for me,

15:57.958 --> 16:00.391
because ruth
is one of my favorite cooks.

16:00.427 --> 16:01.592
Aw.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.027
Yes, david grew up
around this table.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.929
His folks and our family,

16:04.965 --> 16:06.831
we celebrated
every holiday together

16:06.866 --> 16:07.932
until they moved away.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.401
Every hanukkah
that I can remember.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.237
Lenny and my dad
were best friends.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.439
Yeah, david's like family.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.841
Well, christina
really is family,

16:16.876 --> 16:18.443
according to her dna results.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.410
We just need to figure out
the connection.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.378
Hmm.

16:20.413 --> 16:21.879
Um, I was adopted,

16:21.915 --> 16:26.184
so I have no information.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.051
Where did you grow up?

16:27.087 --> 16:28.720
Uh, here in cleveland.

16:28.755 --> 16:29.887
Where were you born?

16:29.923 --> 16:32.857
Uh, fairview hospital.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.692
Yeah.

16:34.728 --> 16:35.893
When's your birthday?

16:35.929 --> 16:39.397
November 24th.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.633
I was born on thanksgiving day,
if you can believe it.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.102
No way.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.236
You were born
on that holiday as well?

16:45.271 --> 16:46.537
No, I...

16:46.573 --> 16:48.740
[voices fade]

16:48.775 --> 16:50.908
well, my mom...

16:50.944 --> 16:53.311
[♪♪♪]

16:53.346 --> 16:54.545
excuse me.

17:14.768 --> 17:17.902
Well, thanks for
sharing the story with us.

17:17.937 --> 17:20.638
It was amazing.

17:20.673 --> 17:22.907
This looks so good.

17:22.942 --> 17:23.908
Ma, are you okay?

17:25.311 --> 17:26.344
Yeah.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.679
Is it... Is it about dad?

17:28.715 --> 17:31.082
Sometimes,
mom really misses him.

17:31.117 --> 17:35.486
I always miss him,
but that isn't what's wrong.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.255
What is it?

17:37.290 --> 17:39.323
This isn't the time or place.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.960
The time or the place
for what?

17:50.303 --> 17:51.769
Just give me a second.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.275
When I was in college,

17:57.310 --> 18:00.011
I, um...

18:00.046 --> 18:02.513
I was an exchange student
in Italy,

18:02.549 --> 18:04.449
and I fell in love,

18:04.484 --> 18:07.218
and we got married
much too young,

18:07.253 --> 18:12.957
and it didn't work out,
so we had it annulled,

18:12.992 --> 18:15.626
and when I got back
to the states,

18:15.662 --> 18:17.328
I found out
I was pregnant, and...

18:19.265 --> 18:20.498
Christina...

18:22.836 --> 18:23.668
I'm...

18:25.772 --> 18:27.105
I'm your biological mother.

18:32.011 --> 18:34.846
Uh, you were married
to someone else?

18:34.881 --> 18:37.048
Yeah, it was many years
before dad,

18:37.083 --> 18:39.417
and... And for
just a short time.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.385
How could we not know
about this?

18:44.090 --> 18:46.757
Oh, my goodness.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.226
This means
you're my half-sister.

18:51.397 --> 18:53.164
There's so much
I want to tell you.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.135
I can't.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.438
I'm sorry.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.573
No, I'm here
whenever you're ready.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.408
I think this is...

19:04.444 --> 19:06.511
Just about all I can handle
right now.

19:08.047 --> 19:09.747
I'm sorry.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.338
[knocking]

19:38.278 --> 19:39.243
are you okay to drive?

19:39.279 --> 19:41.078
Can I give you a lift?

19:41.114 --> 19:42.213
I'm fine.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.649
You don't seem fine.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.618
I don't know what I am.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.722
I'm sorry, I just...
I have to go.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.357
Okay.

20:12.278 --> 20:13.277
Is she all right?

20:14.981 --> 20:16.080
She'll be fine.

20:16.115 --> 20:17.915
I don't even know her,

20:17.951 --> 20:19.083
and...

20:19.118 --> 20:20.618
I already love her.

20:33.700 --> 20:37.535
We're making
really good progress.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.402
I'll have to move

20:38.438 --> 20:40.404
the lighting fixture
in the ceiling,

20:40.440 --> 20:41.439
but don't worry.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.607
I'll have it done
by your christmas eve dinner,

20:42.642 --> 20:43.841
-I promise.
-Wonderful.

20:45.645 --> 20:46.944
Would you like to come
to our christmas dinner?

20:46.980 --> 20:50.348
It's mostly the staff
and their families,

20:50.383 --> 20:51.949
and the morettis.

20:51.985 --> 20:54.218
They were really close
to sophia.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.553
We have a really good time.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.222
Yeah, sure, that'd be great.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.123
Okay.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.224
[laughing]

21:06.266 --> 21:07.798
so, what happened?

21:07.834 --> 21:10.468
How was your brunch yesterday?

21:10.503 --> 21:11.869
I just met
my biological mother.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.272
Ruth.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.073
She is becky's mom.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.375
Wow.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.976
Wow, right?

21:19.012 --> 21:20.811
Becky just sent me a text.

21:20.847 --> 21:21.912
Ruth sent me an email.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.080
I don't know how to respond.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.983
I mean, I'm very conflicted.

21:26.019 --> 21:28.119
Sophia is my mother.

21:28.154 --> 21:29.387
It's not like I'm going
to turn around

21:29.422 --> 21:31.389
and just replace her
with somebody new.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.324
Oh, it's doesn't have
to be one or the other.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.059
I mean,
you can have them both.

21:35.094 --> 21:38.963
We don't have any history,
or shared memories.

21:38.998 --> 21:40.298
You'll make new memories.

21:42.435 --> 21:46.270
Well, yesterday
is definitely a memory

21:46.306 --> 21:48.606
that I am never going to forget.

21:53.346 --> 21:56.280
There's just so much about this
I still don't get.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.115
[sighing]

21:58.151 --> 22:00.318
I'm sure.

22:00.353 --> 22:02.987
I...

22:03.022 --> 22:04.588
It is so important to me

22:04.624 --> 22:08.592
to help you
try to understand.

22:08.628 --> 22:12.330
I was really lost...

22:12.365 --> 22:14.298
For so many years,

22:14.334 --> 22:16.500
just...

22:16.536 --> 22:19.136
Constantly wondering
if I'd done the right thing.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.673
And then I had
the great good fortune

22:22.709 --> 22:24.842
of meeting your dad,

22:24.877 --> 22:26.110
who was just...

22:28.514 --> 22:30.514
...He was just the kindest,
most wonderful man.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.816
Did dad know?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.484
Oh, yes, of course.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.685
He...

22:35.922 --> 22:38.689
But he wanted me
to be the one to tell you.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.826
Well, you should have.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.160
I know.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.662
There were so many times
I wanted to tell you,

22:44.697 --> 22:46.864
and then...

22:46.899 --> 22:50.334
And then the older you got,
the harder it got.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.138
They say timing is everything,

22:54.173 --> 22:59.176
but whatever the right time was,
I must have missed it.

22:59.212 --> 23:01.812
Hey.

23:01.848 --> 23:04.382
You know, maybe this was
the right time.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.487
Thank you.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.823
On the upside,

23:12.859 --> 23:15.826
I get a sister
who I really like.

23:15.862 --> 23:16.827
And I found her first.

23:16.863 --> 23:17.728
Okay, you've known her

23:17.764 --> 23:19.096
for, like, two minutes
longer than me.

23:19.132 --> 23:21.232
Oh, come on, scott.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.200
You have no idea
how happy it makes me

23:23.236 --> 23:24.402
to hear you two squabble.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.007
So, I was thinking

23:30.042 --> 23:32.910
we could add another
one or two tables by the window.

23:32.945 --> 23:36.113
Mm... I like it the way it is.

23:36.149 --> 23:37.882
Why does it have to change?

23:37.917 --> 23:40.518
Okay. It was just a thought.

23:40.553 --> 23:41.619
When I look
around the restaurant,

23:41.654 --> 23:44.755
all I see is my mom...

23:44.791 --> 23:45.956
And I just want
to hold on to that

23:45.992 --> 23:47.258
for as long as I can.

23:48.394 --> 23:49.760
[entry bells jingle]

23:52.432 --> 23:53.431
okay.

23:54.434 --> 23:55.399
Hi.

23:55.435 --> 23:58.702
Janet, meet david singer.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.872
The david singer
that didn't like your lasagna?

24:01.908 --> 24:03.474
Yes.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.709
Mm-hmm.

24:07.513 --> 24:08.546
This is a lot of christmas.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.880
You have a problem with that?

24:09.916 --> 24:11.549
No, no, it looks nice.

24:11.584 --> 24:14.051
-Meaning "overdone"?
-"nice" meaning I like it.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.553
Why are you here?

24:17.457 --> 24:18.456
Ruth was worried about you.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.157
Ah.

24:20.193 --> 24:21.559
And also,

24:21.594 --> 24:22.626
I had a meeting
with my editor,

24:22.662 --> 24:24.395
so I told her I'd stop by.

24:24.430 --> 24:26.497
I'm just...

24:26.532 --> 24:27.798
I'm trying
to figure it all out.

24:27.834 --> 24:29.967
She also told me
to try the lasagna

24:30.002 --> 24:31.001
and be nice about it.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.303
Uh-huh.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.805
Not a review,
just unofficially.

24:34.841 --> 24:37.475
We're closed
for repairs, so...

24:37.510 --> 24:39.910
But that doesn't mean
you can't cook.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.345
Why don't you whip up
some lasagna

24:41.380 --> 24:43.247
and try and change his mind?

24:45.718 --> 24:48.118
I... Could... Do that.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.653
Sounds great.

24:53.025 --> 24:56.160
Did you know that lasagna
originated in ancient greece?

24:56.195 --> 24:58.829
It's italian to me.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.965
This is really good.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.435
It's not as forgettable
as you remember?

25:04.470 --> 25:06.770
[chuckling]

25:06.806 --> 25:09.607
your review came out

25:09.642 --> 25:12.843
a few weeks
after my mom passed away.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.380
-I'm so sorry.
-You weren't wrong.

25:16.415 --> 25:19.183
I wasn't at my best,

25:19.218 --> 25:21.852
in the kitchen
or anywhere else.

25:21.888 --> 25:24.889
Sometimes, I can go
a little too far.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.390
You know, I get
a little too passionate

25:26.425 --> 25:27.358
about food.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.362
Where did you
discover your passion?

25:31.397 --> 25:35.466
I worked for my dad in
the restaurant supply business.

25:35.501 --> 25:36.567
I'd sample the food,

25:36.602 --> 25:39.737
and I began to develop
some pretty strong opinions.

25:39.772 --> 25:40.971
And how do you know so much

25:41.007 --> 25:42.373
about lasagna
and ancient greece?

25:42.408 --> 25:43.340
Who rattles off these things?

25:43.376 --> 25:45.075
I travel a lot.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.311
Sort of a...
Culinary wanderer,

25:47.346 --> 25:51.215
and I fell in love
with cross-cultural cooking.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.316
I'm actually planning
to write a book about it.

25:52.351 --> 25:53.417
Good for you.

25:53.452 --> 25:55.219
I haven't written it yet.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.087
I keep getting distracted.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.523
Critics can be very critical
of their own work.

25:59.559 --> 26:00.624
Yeah.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.727
I gave eddie
some of your lasagna.

26:03.763 --> 26:06.196
He is in heaven.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.665
-Um...
-What?

26:07.700 --> 26:09.066
I have to go.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.669
But lorenzo is delivering
the statue any minute.

26:11.704 --> 26:12.736
I know,

26:12.772 --> 26:15.172
and I hate
to miss the unveiling,

26:15.207 --> 26:16.607
but I have my niece's
ballet recital.

26:16.642 --> 26:17.508
Okay.

26:17.543 --> 26:18.909
-Bye.
-Bye.

26:18.945 --> 26:19.843
See you guys later.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.113
It's a statue?

26:23.149 --> 26:27.618
Yeah, my mom,
she always wanted

26:27.653 --> 26:30.421
a statue of an angel
in the courtyard,

26:30.456 --> 26:32.756
and today
I'm fulfilling her wish,

26:32.792 --> 26:34.425
just in time for christmas.

26:34.460 --> 26:36.193
Well, you got me beat there.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.428
The best gift
I ever gave my mom

26:37.463 --> 26:38.729
was a golf cart,

26:38.764 --> 26:39.930
which had battery problems,

26:39.966 --> 26:41.532
then she gave up golf...

26:41.567 --> 26:43.901
A statue would've been
much better.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.004
You're funny.

26:49.075 --> 26:49.907
-Oh.
-Cheers.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.042
Cheers.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.110
To passion.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.349
Wow.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.119
It's everything...

27:02.154 --> 27:03.287
And so much more.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.089
She'll watch over you.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.457
Lorenzo, thank you.

27:09.595 --> 27:10.894
Take good care of her.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.330
-I will.
-[chuckling]

27:13.366 --> 27:14.798
I think he means the angel.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.771
I would say lorenzo nailed it.

27:20.806 --> 27:21.505
He did.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.108
Anyway,
I should get going.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.209
David...

27:26.479 --> 27:27.478
Thank you.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.252
I think you should call ruth.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.621
It's not
an easy call for me to make.

27:37.657 --> 27:40.090
I mean, finding out
you have another mother...

27:40.126 --> 27:43.127
It's very complicated for me.

27:43.162 --> 27:46.730
She has the biggest heart
of anyone I know.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.566
I'm just saying.

27:51.203 --> 27:54.638
And now I will say goodbye.

27:54.674 --> 27:55.639
Ciao.

27:56.676 --> 27:57.675
Arrivederci.

27:57.710 --> 27:59.710
[laughing]

27:59.745 --> 28:00.844
did you know
I can say goodbye

28:00.880 --> 28:02.479
in 40 different languages?

28:03.916 --> 28:05.049
Okay, bye.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.350
Okay.

28:06.385 --> 28:07.217

There's so much I want to say,

29:06.212 --> 29:07.344
and I don't even know
where to begin.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.014
I was...

29:11.050 --> 29:14.051
I was 19
when I met your father.

29:14.086 --> 29:14.918
He was italian...

29:14.954 --> 29:21.358
My... My mom,
my adoptive mom, sophia,

29:21.393 --> 29:22.359
she was italian.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.594
Oh.

29:23.629 --> 29:25.462
I've always felt
italian at heart.

29:25.498 --> 29:27.364
Oh, well...

29:27.399 --> 29:29.466
I'm not surprised, yeah.

29:29.502 --> 29:32.136
Giorgio, your father, was, uh...

29:32.171 --> 29:34.104
He was in the italian army,

29:34.140 --> 29:37.374
and his parents
were opposed to the marriage.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.376
They were very set
in their ways,

29:39.411 --> 29:42.446
and so...

29:42.481 --> 29:44.114
When I found out
I was pregnant,

29:44.150 --> 29:47.451
I... I tried to reach him,

29:47.486 --> 29:49.953
but he had been deployed,

29:49.989 --> 29:51.488
and there was...

29:51.524 --> 29:55.459
There was no internet then,
and no emails,

29:55.494 --> 29:59.429
and my letters were returned,

29:59.465 --> 30:02.132
and...

30:02.168 --> 30:03.567
I never did contact him.

30:06.138 --> 30:06.904
But I was very young,

30:06.939 --> 30:11.241
and I knew
that I was not capable

30:11.277 --> 30:13.043
of raising a child on my own...

30:15.514 --> 30:17.881
So I gave you up for adoption.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.120
But I never, I never
stopped thinking about you,

30:23.155 --> 30:24.454
and I never...

30:24.490 --> 30:25.989
I always wondered
where you were, and...

30:26.025 --> 30:27.491
-It's okay.
-...And how you were...

30:27.526 --> 30:28.592
It's okay.

30:30.563 --> 30:31.461
...What your life was like.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.864
My... My mom...

30:33.899 --> 30:35.833
She wasn't married,

30:35.868 --> 30:38.135
she really wanted a child,

30:38.170 --> 30:40.103
and so she adopted...

30:42.241 --> 30:43.340
And I was very happy...

30:45.511 --> 30:47.945
...And I was so loved.

30:47.980 --> 30:51.248
It means so much
to hear you say that.

30:52.718 --> 30:54.084
I'm glad I'm here.

30:56.021 --> 30:56.820
Me too.

30:56.856 --> 30:59.156

that I like decorating

30:59.191 --> 31:01.158

31:01.193 --> 31:04.194
-Really?
-Yeah. Yeah.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.864
Do you want to come
to the first night of hanukkah?

31:06.899 --> 31:08.999
It's... It's Thursday,

31:09.034 --> 31:13.503

31:58.751 --> 31:59.716
See you around?

31:59.752 --> 32:01.818
Yeah. You will.

32:03.389 --> 32:06.256
'kay, I...

32:06.292 --> 32:07.057
I should get going.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.327
Yeah, and I have
a review to write.

32:14.667 --> 32:15.899
I think one of us has to--

32:15.935 --> 32:17.935
-yup.
-Yeah.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.041
Arrivederci.

32:26.345 --> 32:27.277
Au revoir!

32:28.948 --> 32:30.714

32:34.954 --> 32:36.987
Adios!

32:38.023 --> 32:40.390

-Hi.

33:10.589 --> 33:12.122
Oh, you look so lovely.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.690
Thank you.
Happy hanukkah.

33:13.726 --> 33:14.624
Thank you.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.026
-This is for you.
-Oh, thank you so much.

33:16.061 --> 33:18.362
-Happy hanukkah, sis.
-Oh, hello. Hi.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.230
-Let me take your coat.
-Hi. Okay.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.565
Thank you.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.633
That's very nice of both of you.
Thank you.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.736
Okay, come in already,
and meet everyone.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.738
They can't wait to meet you.

33:27.773 --> 33:28.605
Come on, come on, come on!

33:29.908 --> 33:33.076
This is my sister,
christina, you guys.

33:33.112 --> 33:34.411
Hello.

Hi.

33:43.022 --> 33:43.887
And your niece, molly.

33:43.922 --> 33:44.888
Hi.

33:44.923 --> 33:46.490
It's so wonderful to meet you.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.291
It's so wonderful
to meet you, too.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.727
My fiancée, sarah,

33:50.763 --> 33:53.497
is spending the holidays
with her family in london,

33:53.532 --> 33:54.931
but she's really excited
to meet you.

33:54.967 --> 33:56.466
I'm gonna be a flower girl
at the wedding.

33:56.502 --> 33:57.401
Are you going to come?

33:57.436 --> 33:58.435
Uh...

33:58.470 --> 34:00.270
Of course she is.
She's part of the family now.

34:00.305 --> 34:01.505
Here, come on, come on,

34:01.540 --> 34:02.773
let's go sit
in the living room.

34:02.808 --> 34:03.607
Let's go.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.509
I'm so happy
we're all here together.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.010
Ma, this brisket
smells amazing.

34:07.046 --> 34:08.745
I know, it's...
It's almost done.

34:08.781 --> 34:09.813
It's almost ready.

34:09.848 --> 34:13.250
Now, this is called
the shamash.

34:13.285 --> 34:14.818
The menorah
has eight branches.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.454
Each candle represents
one of the eight nights

34:17.489 --> 34:20.023
that the miracle
that is hanukkah lasted.

34:20.059 --> 34:21.925
Tonight is the first night,

34:21.960 --> 34:23.827
so we only light
the first candle.

35:06.038 --> 35:08.138
Wow, and this
from a professional critic.

35:08.173 --> 35:11.208
Well, tonight,
I am just a grateful guest.

you're staying here?

I'm heading to europe

Besides, when his parents
moved to san diego,

35:17.916 --> 35:19.983
I said I would
keep an eye on him,

35:20.018 --> 35:22.085
and no one should spend
the holidays alone.

35:22.121 --> 35:24.988
Well, david, I think it's time
you settle down,

35:25.023 --> 35:27.190
get a place of your own,
maybe have some kids.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.692
Did either of you

35:28.727 --> 35:30.994
happen to see any presents
near the menorah?

35:31.029 --> 35:32.596
Oh!

35:32.631 --> 35:35.732
Oh, wow. Lucky you!

35:35.767 --> 35:37.000
They're off.

35:37.035 --> 35:37.934
Seriously, david,

35:37.970 --> 35:38.935
when you're ready to buy,
give me a call.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.403
Okay.

He's a real estate broker
with a one-track mind.

35:42.407 --> 35:43.340
But I love him.

35:45.244 --> 35:47.744
Oh, this looks like
the best brisket ever.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.346
You say that every year.

35:49.381 --> 35:50.547
Well, it does.

35:50.582 --> 35:51.715
It looks so good.

35:51.750 --> 35:52.682
So do the latkes.

35:52.718 --> 35:55.218
Well, frying latkes in oil
is a tradition.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.920
In the temple,

35:56.955 --> 35:59.389
they only had enough oil
to light the lamp for one night,

35:59.424 --> 36:01.091
but it lasted eight days.

36:01.126 --> 36:03.293
That's how come it's a miracle.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.294
The miracle of the oil.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.530
Wow. You guys are very smart.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.365
Uh, hey, sis, could you
grab the kugel?

36:08.400 --> 36:11.234
-Which one is the kugel?
-I've got it.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.135
[laughter]

36:12.171 --> 36:13.270
uh, maybe the challah, then?

36:13.305 --> 36:15.539
I don't know what
the challah is!

36:15.574 --> 36:16.573
I have so much to learn!

36:16.608 --> 36:18.909
Just take the whole bread board
and follow me.

36:18.944 --> 36:21.978
Okay, here we go.
What is it?

36:22.014 --> 36:25.282
Oh... Aw!

36:25.317 --> 36:27.551
I told you.
What did I tell you?

36:27.586 --> 36:29.085
It's my turn.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.756
Wow, this is
quite the collection.

36:32.791 --> 36:38.061
Well, as my mother used to say,
"why do when you can overdo?"

36:38.096 --> 36:39.462
oh, that one...

36:39.498 --> 36:40.897
That one I got
on a river cruise

36:40.933 --> 36:42.265
when lenny and I
went to austria,

36:42.301 --> 36:44.601
and this one,

36:44.636 --> 36:48.939
this one is actually
over a hundred years old.

36:48.974 --> 36:50.006
It's beautiful.

36:50.042 --> 36:52.242
You know, there are letters

36:52.277 --> 36:54.477
on each of the sides
of the dreidel,

36:54.513 --> 36:59.082
and together they mean

36:59.117 --> 37:00.951
"a great miracle
happened there."

37:06.291 --> 37:07.457
oh...

37:07.492 --> 37:09.593
Oh, this is when
we took the kids fishing.

37:09.628 --> 37:11.628
Oh, springfield lake.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.762
Mm. I caught a catfish.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.097
I caught a shoe.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.102
Oh, and that's my lenny.

37:19.137 --> 37:21.204
With max.

37:21.240 --> 37:24.074
Aw. I miss him dearly.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.313
This is your grandmother,
rachel.

37:32.751 --> 37:33.984
You have the same eyes.

37:34.019 --> 37:35.118
She had green eyes, like we do.

37:39.725 --> 37:40.824
So, what do you think
of hanukkah?

37:42.194 --> 37:42.859
It's pretty great.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.961
And it's only the first night.

37:44.997 --> 37:46.363
Yeah.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.665
Would... Would you guys
like to come to my house

37:48.700 --> 37:50.000
for the last night of hanukkah?

37:51.737 --> 37:53.336
I can't think of anything
I'd like more.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.513
[entry bells jingle]

38:10.088 --> 38:11.921
hi.

38:11.957 --> 38:12.789
Hello.

38:12.824 --> 38:15.492
So I'm finally
outlining my new book,

38:15.527 --> 38:17.227
and I thought about you.

38:17.262 --> 38:19.396
Really, about a woman
who doesn't know from kugel?

38:19.431 --> 38:20.764
[laughing]

38:20.799 --> 38:21.765
that's my next book.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.000
What's this one called?

38:24.036 --> 38:25.502
It's called
"the cultural heritage

38:25.537 --> 38:27.771
of tradition and food
in the mediterranean."

38:27.806 --> 38:29.506
well, that's catchy.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.574
I look forward to reading it.

38:31.610 --> 38:34.411
You inspired me
to do more research

38:34.446 --> 38:36.179
on the jewish influence
of italian food.

38:36.214 --> 38:37.514
Okay.

38:37.549 --> 38:38.615
Take artichoke, for instance.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.916
-Artichokes?
-Yeah.

38:39.951 --> 38:41.451
Well, the way you prepare it...

38:41.486 --> 38:43.386
-Yeah?
-Uh, fried in oil.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.088
It's called
"carciofi alla giudia."

38:45.123 --> 38:46.089
yeah, I know what that is.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.024
No, I just don't--

38:48.060 --> 38:49.592
that might-- no.

38:49.628 --> 38:50.794
My customers
aren't expecting this.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.862
Exactly.
Maybe you could try it.

38:52.898 --> 38:53.863
No, thank you.

38:53.899 --> 38:54.864
I really, really, really

38:54.900 --> 38:58.034
don't need any more
of your menu suggestions.

38:58.070 --> 38:59.202
Okay?

38:59.237 --> 39:01.237
I'm going
to get back to work.

39:09.314 --> 39:10.313
I'm sorry.

39:10.349 --> 39:12.449
I just...

39:12.484 --> 39:14.284
You know, everything
about this place

39:14.319 --> 39:15.752
is just tied to my mother,

39:15.787 --> 39:18.755
so, just...
It just hits a raw nerve.

39:20.258 --> 39:22.092
Forget everything I just said.

39:22.127 --> 39:24.260
Honestly, it was just
an excuse to see you.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.798
Pretense has never been
my strong suit.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.668
No, it really needs work.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.436
Next time I show up,

39:33.472 --> 39:35.472
I am going to leave
the artichokes out of it.

39:36.975 --> 39:40.310
I'm on my way
to get a christmas tree, if...

39:40.345 --> 39:42.345
Do you mind if I tag along?

39:42.381 --> 39:44.614
I mean, if I'm going
to write this book,

39:44.649 --> 39:47.784
I need to know all about
christmas and the traditions.

39:47.819 --> 39:49.519
Okay, but I expect

39:49.554 --> 39:52.288
a very flattering
"thank you" in your book.

39:52.324 --> 39:55.592
"my deepest appreciation

39:55.627 --> 39:58.628
to the unpredictable,

39:58.663 --> 40:03.266
unforgettable christina rossi."

40:06.238 --> 40:07.604
that'll do.

40:17.682 --> 40:19.315
You sure you have
enough lawn ornaments?

40:19.351 --> 40:21.584
You're critiquing
my christmas decorations?

40:23.622 --> 40:24.587

[straining to lift]

40:29.594 --> 40:30.660
ah.

40:30.695 --> 40:31.995
Only you would have reindeer

40:32.030 --> 40:33.963
lighting the way
to your hanukkah dinner.

40:33.999 --> 40:35.298
You see a contradiction
in that?

40:35.333 --> 40:37.033
In the best possible way.

40:38.703 --> 40:39.903
Let's get this tree inside.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.638
-Okay.
-Okay.

40:41.673 --> 40:44.674
[turning record player down]

40:44.709 --> 40:47.343
some of these ornaments
are older than me.

40:47.379 --> 40:49.646
This one, this one's italian.

40:49.681 --> 40:52.582
"buon natale."
that's "merry christmas."

40:52.617 --> 40:53.983
who's this?

40:54.019 --> 40:58.121
Ooh, that is babbo natale.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.088
That's the italian santa.

40:59.124 --> 40:59.956
Ah.

40:59.991 --> 41:02.025
Wow.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.127
My life is on this tree.

41:04.162 --> 41:06.262
And my mom's.

41:06.298 --> 41:07.464
Mothers pass along
their childhoods.

41:07.499 --> 41:09.132
And their taste in music.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.333
Yeah, who is this?

41:10.368 --> 41:12.168
What? This... This...

41:12.204 --> 41:13.169
This is lou monte!

41:13.205 --> 41:15.271
Oh, right.

41:15.307 --> 41:17.373
I think I have
his hanukkah album.

41:17.409 --> 41:19.442
I grew up listening

41:19.478 --> 41:21.511
to my mom's
christmas record collection.

41:21.546 --> 41:24.214
Connie francis, perry como,

41:24.249 --> 41:26.449
but my favorite
was always lou monte.

41:26.485 --> 41:28.284
I would just listen
to his recording

41:28.320 --> 41:30.153
of "dominick the donkey"
all the time.

41:30.188 --> 41:32.555
Strangely, I'm not familiar
with that one.

41:32.591 --> 41:34.491
Lou and I do
a really great duet.

41:34.526 --> 41:36.226
Oh, I'm sure
it's just great.

41:36.261 --> 41:37.527
Yeah.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.331
So, this is christmas.

41:41.366 --> 41:45.802
Yeah, what do you think?

41:45.837 --> 41:47.103
I understand
why you don't want it to end.

41:48.373 --> 41:49.539
Yeah.

41:53.745 --> 41:55.912
I do not know
what to get christina.

41:55.947 --> 41:58.081
Oh, I don't either.

41:58.116 --> 41:59.983
I mean, she's...
She's my daughter,

42:00.018 --> 42:00.917
she's your sister.

42:00.952 --> 42:04.354
There's so much
I don't know about her.

42:04.389 --> 42:05.221
And what do we put on the card?

42:05.257 --> 42:07.991
Is this for hanukkah
or for christmas?

42:08.026 --> 42:10.326
Both, I guess.

42:10.362 --> 42:12.362
[gasping]
what about a watch?

42:12.397 --> 42:13.696
No, no, no, no.

42:13.732 --> 42:15.031
It should be more personal.

42:15.066 --> 42:17.033
Well, like what?

42:17.068 --> 42:18.835
I don't have a clue.

42:21.072 --> 42:24.173
Maybe you should ask david.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.676
Scott told me
that david told him

42:26.711 --> 42:28.912
that he and christina
have been hanging out.

42:28.947 --> 42:30.413
Oh, I had...

42:30.448 --> 42:32.282
I had a hunch about those two.

42:32.317 --> 42:33.116
Well, both of them are single.

42:33.151 --> 42:35.718
She did mention an ex
named roger,

42:35.754 --> 42:36.886
but that sounded very over.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.555
Hmm...

42:38.590 --> 42:40.890
Oh, no.

42:40.926 --> 42:42.392
I know that look.

42:42.427 --> 42:43.927
Don't you start meddling.

42:43.962 --> 42:45.194
Me?

42:45.230 --> 42:46.195
Meddle?

42:46.231 --> 42:47.397
Never.

42:47.432 --> 42:48.665
Mom...

42:50.268 --> 42:52.702
This is very exciting.

42:52.737 --> 42:53.937
[gasping]

42:53.972 --> 42:55.371
here it is.

42:55.407 --> 42:56.339
Hello.

42:56.374 --> 42:59.475
I used to walk by this stall
all the time,

42:59.511 --> 43:01.177
and now it's
my new favorite shop.

43:02.914 --> 43:03.947
What do you think?

43:03.982 --> 43:05.248
It would look good
on my mantle.

43:05.283 --> 43:08.051
I think he's... Adorable.

43:09.421 --> 43:10.787
Thank you.

43:10.822 --> 43:13.623
I just love coming here.

43:13.658 --> 43:16.659
You can find
so many treasures.

43:16.695 --> 43:18.761
I come here for the food.

43:18.797 --> 43:22.098
The best dumplings in the city
are right around the corner.

43:23.535 --> 43:25.501
Mm. "la petite chinese."

43:25.537 --> 43:29.772
a fusion
of french and chinese cuisine.

43:29.808 --> 43:31.274
Two orders
of your dumplings du jour.

43:31.309 --> 43:32.275
Absolutely.

43:32.310 --> 43:33.343
Because of your review,

43:33.378 --> 43:34.277
we bought
a brand-new food truck.

43:34.312 --> 43:36.512
[gasping] what?

43:36.548 --> 43:38.147
You give good reviews?

43:38.183 --> 43:39.482
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

43:39.517 --> 43:41.451
Oh, ho, ho, ho. Yes.

43:43.555 --> 43:44.754
Do you do any cooking,

43:44.789 --> 43:46.489
or you just write
about people that do?

43:46.524 --> 43:47.924
[chuckling]

43:47.959 --> 43:50.593
I make a pretty mean
noodle kugel.

43:50.629 --> 43:51.494
Want to show me how it's done?

43:51.529 --> 43:54.364
Of course.

43:54.399 --> 43:56.432
Actually, I used to make kugel
with my dad.

43:56.468 --> 44:00.503
Not the best cook,
but he's a really good guy.

44:02.707 --> 44:04.874
I don't know anything
about my dad.

44:04.909 --> 44:07.777
I think about him all the time.

44:07.812 --> 44:09.512
Maybe you'll meet him someday.

44:11.983 --> 44:13.182
Yeah.

44:13.218 --> 44:16.185
Hey, it's time.

44:16.221 --> 44:17.987
-Ready?
-All right.

44:18.023 --> 44:19.822
Perfect. Perfect.

44:19.858 --> 44:20.957
-Okay.
-One...

44:20.992 --> 44:22.291
Two...

44:22.327 --> 44:23.126
-[cookies cracking]
-three!

44:23.161 --> 44:25.828
[laughing] okay.

44:25.864 --> 44:31.100
Um, "those who sit in judgment
have a fear of being judged."

44:34.406 --> 44:36.539
"you don't have
to let go of the old

44:36.574 --> 44:38.141
to embrace the new."

44:39.244 --> 44:43.546
okay, I think fate
got us confused.

44:43.581 --> 44:44.380
[laughing]

44:47.252 --> 44:48.484
I like that
our futures overlap.

44:56.261 --> 44:58.494
Oh, good, you're here.

44:58.530 --> 45:00.496
I want to talk to you
about christina.

45:00.532 --> 45:01.531
Okay.

45:01.566 --> 45:02.532
Yeah. It's important.

45:02.567 --> 45:03.866
Okay.

45:06.071 --> 45:08.871
I understand you have been
spending a lot of time together.

45:08.907 --> 45:11.774
That's right.

45:11.810 --> 45:13.409
So I want to get her a gift,

45:13.445 --> 45:16.679
and I have no idea
what she'd like.

45:16.715 --> 45:18.781
I thought you were going
to ask me my intentions

45:18.817 --> 45:19.716
regarding your daughter.

45:19.751 --> 45:22.051
[laughing]

45:22.087 --> 45:23.853
well, well, now that
you've brought it up,

45:23.888 --> 45:25.421
what...
What are your intentions?

45:25.457 --> 45:27.423
Just to spend
some time together.

45:27.459 --> 45:30.960
There's something I find
so endearing about her.

45:30.995 --> 45:33.730
Mm, good.

45:33.765 --> 45:36.065
As to my other question
about a gift,

45:36.101 --> 45:37.467
do you have any idea?

45:37.502 --> 45:40.036
I want to get her
something really special,

45:40.071 --> 45:42.572
and I feel like I'm making up
for so much lost time.

45:42.607 --> 45:45.241
I know she's really curious
about her father.

45:45.276 --> 45:48.644
Do you have any pictures of him
that you could give to her?

45:48.680 --> 45:52.148
I do, but...

45:52.183 --> 45:53.750
I have no idea where it is...

45:53.785 --> 45:55.718
But that's a really good idea.

45:55.754 --> 45:57.053
Do you have any way
of reaching him?

45:57.088 --> 45:59.555
Mm...

45:59.591 --> 46:01.157
After all this time,
I don't know.

46:01.192 --> 46:03.693
I... I wouldn't even
know where to begin.

46:04.996 --> 46:08.498
What if we could find him?

46:08.533 --> 46:11.434
What if christina
could talk to her father?

46:11.469 --> 46:13.803
And then if they wanted to,

46:13.838 --> 46:15.004
they could
take it from there.

46:15.039 --> 46:16.773
You sure
you're okay with that?

46:16.808 --> 46:20.076
Oh, I... I want whatever's
going to make her happy.

46:20.111 --> 46:21.944
I want to give her

46:21.980 --> 46:26.315
a hanukkah-christmas gift
that she'll always remember.

46:29.954 --> 46:33.523
I still have to get something
for my dad and my nephew.

46:33.558 --> 46:36.559
Well, my shopping list
just got a lot longer,

46:36.594 --> 46:39.195
'cause I have to shop
for my whole new family.

46:39.230 --> 46:41.631
Becky said that
they exchange gifts

46:41.666 --> 46:43.032
on the last night of hanukkah,

46:43.067 --> 46:44.300
so I have to figure out
what to get everybody,

46:44.335 --> 46:46.302
and I just want it
to be perfect.

46:46.337 --> 46:47.904
Oh, don't put so much pressure
on yourself.

46:47.939 --> 46:49.572
Just enjoy it.

46:49.607 --> 46:51.140
Yeah.

46:51.176 --> 46:54.477
It's funny to care so much
about people that you just met.

46:54.512 --> 46:58.214
I mean, I don't really know
how to feel.

46:58.249 --> 47:01.884
I'm sort of torn
between really missing my mom

47:01.920 --> 47:06.455
and wanting
to be close to these people,

47:06.491 --> 47:08.558
and now I just...
I even feel guilty

47:08.593 --> 47:10.293
about just saying it out loud.

47:10.328 --> 47:11.761
You're allowed to be happy.

47:13.698 --> 47:16.799
Well, becky
is easy to shop for and please.

47:16.835 --> 47:19.402
I have no idea
what to get scott.

47:19.437 --> 47:20.770
And what about ruth?

47:20.805 --> 47:22.972
Oh, talk about loaded.

47:23.007 --> 47:24.974
Shopping for your other mother.

47:25.009 --> 47:27.610
Well, I'm sure she's gonna love
anything that you get her.

47:27.645 --> 47:29.979
And I guess I should
get something for david.

47:30.014 --> 47:31.414
But talk about hard to shop for.

47:31.449 --> 47:33.583
He is so opinionated.

47:33.618 --> 47:36.686
He certainly has
a good opinion about you.

47:36.721 --> 47:39.488
He's coming over
this afternoon,

47:39.524 --> 47:42.325
and we are making
noodle kugel.

47:42.360 --> 47:45.161
Oh... How romantic.

47:46.998 --> 47:49.765
Okay, what's wrong
with this picture?

47:49.801 --> 47:51.767
I just made noodle kugel

47:51.803 --> 47:53.803
while wearing
a santa claus apron,

47:53.838 --> 47:54.937
listening to christmas music.

47:54.973 --> 47:56.606
The hanukkah aprons
that I ordered

47:56.641 --> 47:57.707
haven't arrived yet.

47:57.742 --> 48:00.209
You know,
it's kind of interesting,

48:00.245 --> 48:01.344
straddling two holidays.

48:02.881 --> 48:04.113
Welcome to my world.

48:04.148 --> 48:05.281
[he chuckles]

48:05.316 --> 48:08.117
this is so good.

48:08.152 --> 48:10.519
You know, kugel's
just as popular in Italy

48:10.555 --> 48:12.121
as it is in brooklyn.

48:12.156 --> 48:13.389
It's a truly international dish.

48:13.424 --> 48:15.358
Well, you should put that
in your book.

48:17.495 --> 48:18.694
I started writing
my first chapter.

48:18.730 --> 48:20.897
That's so great.

48:20.932 --> 48:24.500
Then I rewrote it
and rewrote it.

48:24.535 --> 48:27.336
Turns out I did
more deleting than writing.

48:27.372 --> 48:30.139
Well, what do you think is...
Holding you back?

48:30.174 --> 48:32.508
The fact that I'm only good
for a thousand words.

48:32.543 --> 48:35.645
Reviews don't require
a great deal of talent.

48:38.683 --> 48:41.317
It's funny, I've never
admitted that to anyone...

48:41.352 --> 48:42.919
Not even myself.

48:42.954 --> 48:45.354
You should make it
more personal,

48:45.390 --> 48:47.590
and less factual.

48:47.625 --> 48:51.994
You're funny, and you're...
You're off the cuff.

48:52.030 --> 48:55.364
Show that.

to read that?

48:59.804 --> 49:00.603
-Hey, you know what?
-What?

49:00.638 --> 49:01.437
We should get going.

49:01.472 --> 49:03.406
Where are we going?

49:03.441 --> 49:04.840
It's a surprise.

49:04.876 --> 49:07.777
Okay. Am I dressed okay?

49:07.812 --> 49:09.612
We might want
to lose the aprons.

49:09.647 --> 49:10.713
Okay.

49:13.551 --> 49:17.086
I don't suppose you want
to tell me where we're going.

49:17.121 --> 49:18.754
Aw, what would be
the fun in that?

49:18.790 --> 49:20.022
Just a little clue.

49:20.058 --> 49:23.125
Okay, it's something
I do every year.

49:23.161 --> 49:25.795
You are impossible.

52:02.553 --> 52:06.122
A carrot for the nose,
and buttons for his eyes.

52:06.157 --> 52:08.491
And, of course,
licorice for the smile.

52:10.228 --> 52:12.428
You must think we're nuts
with all the sports stuff.

52:12.463 --> 52:13.362
I think it's wonderful.

52:13.397 --> 52:14.296
Yeah?

52:14.332 --> 52:16.432
We're still huge cubs fans.

52:16.467 --> 52:18.467
That's how
we keep my dad alive.

52:18.503 --> 52:19.969
Well, at least
that's what it is for me.

52:20.004 --> 52:22.271
That same with me,
for my mom,

52:22.306 --> 52:24.740
the mom who adopted me.

52:24.775 --> 52:28.544
Every recipe, every tradition,
every song...

52:28.579 --> 52:30.746
I really like
getting to know you.

52:30.781 --> 52:32.148
Oh...

52:32.183 --> 52:34.750
This is what it must be like
to have a sister.

52:34.785 --> 52:35.851
Yeah.

52:37.421 --> 52:39.088
So phil says
I always go overboard,

52:39.123 --> 52:40.556
which I probably do,

52:40.591 --> 52:42.758
but I'm really happy
I found you.

52:42.793 --> 52:45.561
I think "overboard"
runs in our genes.

52:45.596 --> 52:48.164
You have no idea.

52:48.199 --> 52:49.832
We took the kids
to a basketball game once,

52:49.867 --> 52:51.634
and they were
watching their mom

52:51.669 --> 52:53.002
instead of the court.

52:53.037 --> 52:54.503
I don't think I sat down once.

52:54.539 --> 52:55.804
I was hoarse
from all the cheering.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.107
-I do the same thing.
-No.

52:58.142 --> 52:59.141
With cooking competition shows.

52:59.177 --> 53:00.843
I'm just...

53:00.878 --> 53:03.179
I'm yelling,
and I'm so intense,

53:03.214 --> 53:06.148
and aah! Go, go, go!

53:06.184 --> 53:07.249
Let's go
give this snowman a face.

53:07.285 --> 53:08.651
Okay.

53:10.855 --> 53:12.388
All right, now, funny faces!

53:13.791 --> 53:14.757
Great.

53:14.792 --> 53:16.959
Ruth, let me get one
of you and your family.

53:17.962 --> 53:19.161
Okay.

53:19.197 --> 53:20.930
You should see
your face right now.

53:21.999 --> 53:22.965
What would I see?

53:23.000 --> 53:24.233
A mother's smile.

53:25.803 --> 53:27.870
Well, you're pretty
smiley yourself, mister.

53:27.905 --> 53:29.605
She's good for you.

53:31.576 --> 53:32.942
Okay, a family. Come on.

53:32.977 --> 53:34.476
Okay.

53:34.512 --> 53:35.477
Family.

53:35.513 --> 53:36.545
Okay. Oh, yes!

53:36.581 --> 53:37.713
No, no, no, no, no!

53:37.748 --> 53:39.114
You're part
of this family now.

53:39.150 --> 53:40.316
Get over here.

53:40.351 --> 53:41.317
Okay, here we go, guys.

53:41.352 --> 53:44.653
One, two, three.

53:44.689 --> 53:45.688
One more.

53:45.723 --> 53:47.089
One, two, three.

53:48.893 --> 53:50.192
Hot chocolate!

53:50.228 --> 53:52.861
-Hot chocolate!
-Okay, okay.

53:59.437 --> 54:01.437
-One more.
-Okay.

54:10.781 --> 54:13.082
[♪♪♪]

54:20.258 --> 54:21.223
it's kinda cool

54:21.259 --> 54:22.591
having a christmas tree
inside a restaurant.

54:22.627 --> 54:23.759
It's a nice touch.

54:23.794 --> 54:25.294
My mom always said

54:25.329 --> 54:26.629
it made it feel
more like a home.

54:26.664 --> 54:28.130
Your mom was right.

54:28.165 --> 54:32.434
Now all we have are the lights.

54:32.470 --> 54:34.703
Would you care
to do the honors?

54:34.739 --> 54:35.738
Yes, my pleasure.

54:35.773 --> 54:36.705
Okay.

54:36.741 --> 54:37.973
One...

54:38.009 --> 54:39.308
Two...

54:39.343 --> 54:40.242
Three!

54:41.279 --> 54:42.211
Yay!

54:46.350 --> 54:48.884
That is a very pretty tree.

54:53.924 --> 54:56.058
Oh... No.

54:56.093 --> 54:57.793
I'm guessing that wasn't
supposed to happen.

54:57.828 --> 54:58.794
No.

54:58.829 --> 55:00.963
Okay, eddie, thanks.

55:00.998 --> 55:01.830
Thanks a lot.

55:01.866 --> 55:03.799
Have a good night.
[beeping call off]

55:03.834 --> 55:07.002
so, eddie called his friend
who works for the city,

55:07.038 --> 55:08.737
and he said that
the power went out

55:08.773 --> 55:09.638
all over the block,

55:09.674 --> 55:11.807
but it should be back on
tomorrow morning.

55:11.842 --> 55:14.643
So your christmas eve dinner
will not be in the dark.

55:14.679 --> 55:16.712
Apparently not.

55:20.985 --> 55:23.519
You know, you didn't need
this elaborate ploy.

55:23.554 --> 55:26.255
If you wanted to hold my hand,
all you had to do was ask.

55:26.290 --> 55:27.589
Good to know.

55:44.575 --> 55:46.809
You should have blackouts
more often.

55:46.844 --> 55:48.711
This is really nice.

55:48.746 --> 55:49.878
I had to empty out the fridge.

55:49.914 --> 55:51.146
I didn't want it
to go to waste.

55:52.650 --> 55:54.116
Oh.

55:54.151 --> 55:56.685
Do you know as much about wine
as you do about food?

55:56.721 --> 55:57.753
I know what I like.

55:57.788 --> 56:01.290
I definitely put more stock
in taste than price.

56:01.325 --> 56:03.659
Yeah.

56:03.694 --> 56:07.096
What's the best bottle
of wine you've ever had?

56:09.533 --> 56:12.301
My parents gave me a bottle
of chateau jean-marc

56:12.336 --> 56:15.137
for my 21st birthday.

56:15.172 --> 56:16.071
They bought it when I was born,

56:16.107 --> 56:18.874
and they let it mature as I did.

56:18.909 --> 56:20.642
Are you close
with your parents?

56:20.678 --> 56:22.578
I am.

56:22.613 --> 56:24.346
But, you know what,
they're in san diego,

56:24.382 --> 56:25.881
and I'm here,

56:25.916 --> 56:27.683
and I'm not really even here.

56:27.718 --> 56:28.617
I no longer have an address,

56:28.652 --> 56:32.721
and I'm about
to spend some time abroad.

56:32.757 --> 56:34.089
Where are you
going to go?

56:34.125 --> 56:35.758
Mostly the mediterranean.

56:35.793 --> 56:37.826
Oh.

56:37.862 --> 56:39.428
Yeah, I got a job
to write a series of reviews,

56:39.463 --> 56:41.397
then I'm going to do
some research for my book.

56:41.432 --> 56:43.532
I... Love to travel.

56:43.567 --> 56:48.337
Yeah. I can see that.

56:48.372 --> 56:51.373
My dad lived
a typical 9-to-5 life,

56:51.409 --> 56:55.344
and I tried it on for size,

56:55.379 --> 56:57.513
and realized it wasn't for me.

56:57.548 --> 56:59.415
I wanted something
less predictable.

57:01.452 --> 57:04.186
That seems to be
a theme of yours.

57:04.221 --> 57:06.088
I wanted you to know
who I am, christina.

57:07.324 --> 57:09.458
Thank you for your honesty.

57:09.493 --> 57:12.094
You know, you seem
to bring that out in me.

57:13.330 --> 57:16.298
Um...

57:16.333 --> 57:22.104
I wish you the greatest success
on your trip,

57:22.139 --> 57:27.075
and I hope
it's full of surprises.

57:27.111 --> 57:29.344
You surprise me.

57:30.514 --> 57:31.413
Buon natale.

57:31.449 --> 57:33.582
Hanukkah sameach.

57:35.653 --> 57:37.352
[clinking glasses]

57:41.659 --> 57:43.292
[chopping]

57:46.864 --> 57:48.597
I'm so happy you called.

57:48.632 --> 57:49.798
I'm a chef.

57:49.834 --> 57:51.600
I want to get it right.

57:51.635 --> 57:54.736
Well, making latkes is...
It's actually pretty simple.

57:54.772 --> 57:56.472
It's just potato, onion,

57:56.507 --> 57:59.975
matzoh meal, with a bit of egg
to hold it all together.

58:00.010 --> 58:02.644
And I think I just wanted us
to make them together.

58:05.282 --> 58:07.916
Well, it's
a time-honored tradition,

58:07.952 --> 58:09.685
making latkes
with your daughter,

58:09.720 --> 58:14.523
just... Just like I made them
with my mom.

58:14.558 --> 58:16.925
Is it okay to use olive oil?

58:16.961 --> 58:18.293
Is that too heavy?

58:18.329 --> 58:20.128
No, no, no, olive oil's fine.

58:20.164 --> 58:21.497
Okay.

58:24.802 --> 58:27.002
I'm emotional by nature,
but this is the onions.

58:28.239 --> 58:29.638
I always blame the onions.

58:29.673 --> 58:31.907
[laughing]

58:41.519 --> 58:43.652
so, what's the good news?

58:43.687 --> 58:45.721
A friend of mine in sicily
came through.

58:45.756 --> 58:47.956
I have a phone number
for giorgio.

58:47.992 --> 58:50.826
On behalf of my sister,
well done.

58:50.861 --> 58:52.227
I just wanted you guys to know.

58:52.263 --> 58:54.363
Giorgio...

58:54.398 --> 58:55.330
I wonder what he's like.

58:55.366 --> 58:58.400
He's christina's father.

58:58.435 --> 58:59.301
That's all that really matters.

58:59.336 --> 59:01.670
Yeah.

59:01.705 --> 59:02.804
Have you told our mom?

59:02.840 --> 59:04.573
Not yet.

59:04.608 --> 59:06.508
She's with christina,
making latkes.

59:06.544 --> 59:07.709
Oh, speaking of latkes...

59:07.745 --> 59:08.677
I tried
to talk him out of it...

59:08.712 --> 59:11.146
"eight crazy latkes"
is doing really well,

59:11.181 --> 59:13.515
so I was thinking
of adding another one.

59:13.551 --> 59:15.651
What do you think of...
[imitating drumroll]

59:15.686 --> 59:16.485
the chocolatke!

59:16.520 --> 59:18.687
I think you've gone
a latke too far.

59:18.722 --> 59:20.522
-Wh--
-mm-hmm.

59:20.558 --> 59:21.423
You haven't even
tried it yet.

59:21.458 --> 59:22.658
Chocolatke?

59:22.693 --> 59:23.692
No goodke?

59:23.727 --> 59:25.193
-[laughing]
-scott...

59:25.229 --> 59:28.230
Giorgio's number.

59:30.401 --> 59:31.433
How did you find him?

59:31.468 --> 59:32.701
It took a little bit
of research,

59:32.736 --> 59:34.503
and, uh, a good friend

59:34.538 --> 59:36.204
whose dad
was in the italian army.

59:36.240 --> 59:37.839
Oh...

59:37.875 --> 59:39.541
What do I say
after all this time?

59:40.911 --> 59:43.345
How do I tell him
such enormous news?

59:44.481 --> 59:45.547
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

59:45.583 --> 59:48.150
Yes, I want this
for christina.

59:49.620 --> 59:50.886
Why don't you
give him a call?

59:53.424 --> 59:54.356
Thanks.

I have something
important to tell you...

1:01:06.864 --> 1:01:08.196
But I just don't know how.

1:01:08.232 --> 1:01:10.332
And what could it be
after so many years?

1:01:10.367 --> 1:01:13.101
<i> Ruth, I'm older and wiser</i>

1:01:13.137 --> 1:01:14.670
and hard to surprise.
What is it?

Giorgio...

1:01:20.577 --> 1:01:23.679
You and I...

1:01:28.085 --> 1:01:29.518
<i> Che cosa?</i>

1:01:37.294 --> 1:01:39.428
[♪♪♪]

1:01:40.564 --> 1:01:43.198
I'm so glad
that we're finished.

1:01:43.233 --> 1:01:44.199
My mom, she used...
She loved this angel,

1:01:44.234 --> 1:01:45.333
and every christmas,

1:01:45.369 --> 1:01:48.603
it was just like being reunited
with an old friend.

1:01:48.639 --> 1:01:49.971
She is a beauty.

1:01:56.146 --> 1:01:57.479
[laughing]

1:02:00.851 --> 1:02:02.317
thank you.

1:02:02.352 --> 1:02:04.419
Any time.

1:02:07.324 --> 1:02:09.357
Okay, I have
to order the brisket

1:02:09.393 --> 1:02:11.560
to serve
with my hanukkah dinner,

1:02:11.595 --> 1:02:13.328
and then we need
to get the wine,

1:02:13.363 --> 1:02:15.230
to serve that with
the feast of the seven fishes,

1:02:15.265 --> 1:02:17.699
and the galliano
to serve after the meal,

1:02:17.735 --> 1:02:19.134
and there's so much to do,

1:02:19.169 --> 1:02:21.970
and I'm not even halfway
through my list.

1:02:22.005 --> 1:02:23.538
Which list?

1:02:23.574 --> 1:02:26.408
I'm spending so much time
on my hanukkah dinner

1:02:26.443 --> 1:02:27.709
that there's no way
I'm going to be ready

1:02:27.745 --> 1:02:29.010
for my christmas eve dinner.

1:02:29.046 --> 1:02:29.878
Mm-hmm.

1:02:29.913 --> 1:02:33.181
Is this about
having two dinners...

1:02:33.217 --> 1:02:34.216
Or two mothers?

1:02:36.220 --> 1:02:39.554

Aw... Well, what's
the problem with that?

1:12:25.742 --> 1:12:26.808
I'm just overwhelmed.

1:12:28.311 --> 1:12:31.279
Why don't you just
take your time

1:12:31.314 --> 1:12:32.780
and see what happens?

1:12:32.816 --> 1:12:36.884
Because when you...

1:12:36.920 --> 1:12:41.923
When you lose someone
you love so much,

1:12:41.958 --> 1:12:46.194
it's very scary to love again.

1:12:56.973 --> 1:12:58.906
How could you not smile
with a tree like that?

1:12:58.942 --> 1:13:01.809
Oh, I just have a lot going on.

1:13:01.845 --> 1:13:03.811
You deserve a break.

1:13:03.847 --> 1:13:05.446
Why don't we do
something fun tonight?

1:13:05.482 --> 1:13:07.115
Ice-skating?

1:13:07.150 --> 1:13:08.416
A moonlit walk?

1:13:08.451 --> 1:13:10.151
Just to be clear,

1:13:10.186 --> 1:13:12.387
this is me
asking you to go on a date.

1:13:14.924 --> 1:13:17.058
I have a lot to do.

1:13:17.093 --> 1:13:18.393
I don't think it's a good idea.

1:13:18.428 --> 1:13:20.628
Ice-skating...
Or us going on a date?

1:13:20.663 --> 1:13:23.765
You're going away.

1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:25.800
You don't live here anymore.

1:13:25.835 --> 1:13:27.635
You don't know
when you're coming back

1:13:27.670 --> 1:13:29.070
or how long
you're going to stay,

1:13:29.105 --> 1:13:31.472
which is fine,

1:13:31.508 --> 1:13:33.674
it's only one date,

1:13:33.710 --> 1:13:36.310
but then
what happens after that?

1:13:36.346 --> 1:13:39.180
I'm just... I feel like
I'm just saying way too much,

1:13:39.215 --> 1:13:40.148
and I'm getting embarrassed,

1:13:40.183 --> 1:13:41.849
so please, just...

1:13:41.885 --> 1:13:44.852
Please just feel free
to stop me. Please.

1:13:44.888 --> 1:13:47.822
That was
a very charming rejection.

1:13:49.459 --> 1:13:54.262
It's not a rejection.

1:13:54.297 --> 1:13:57.432
I'm just not ready.

1:13:57.467 --> 1:13:58.866
My heart,
it just can't keep up

1:13:58.902 --> 1:14:00.268
with all these changes
right now.

1:14:02.172 --> 1:14:03.070
I understand.

1:14:05.241 --> 1:14:07.175
Let's just leave
well enough alone.

1:14:14.050 --> 1:14:14.982
Christina...

1:14:16.820 --> 1:14:19.720
Just so you know,
when I get on that plane,

1:14:19.756 --> 1:14:21.456
I won't just be thinking
about where I'm heading.

1:14:24.394 --> 1:14:26.527
I'm going to remember
everything I'm leaving behind.

1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.667
Arrivederci.

1:14:34.204 --> 1:14:35.169
Ciao.

1:14:56.926 --> 1:14:57.692
Warm you up a bit.

1:14:57.727 --> 1:14:59.460
Thanks.

1:15:01.130 --> 1:15:03.264
That was a good day.

1:15:03.299 --> 1:15:05.199
A snowman
with a licorice smile.

1:15:05.235 --> 1:15:07.235
Mm-hmm.

1:15:07.270 --> 1:15:12.240
Yeah, he's smiling,
but you're not.

1:15:12.275 --> 1:15:13.407
What's going on?

1:15:15.111 --> 1:15:15.843
I don't think christina and I

1:15:15.879 --> 1:15:16.911
will be seeing each other
anymore.

1:15:20.450 --> 1:15:22.550
I think you're telling me this
because you know what I'll say.

1:15:24.420 --> 1:15:25.853
What's that?

1:15:25.889 --> 1:15:27.655
Don't let her go.

1:15:30.660 --> 1:15:31.893
She's not ready
for a relationship.

1:15:31.928 --> 1:15:33.928
Oh, no.

1:15:33.963 --> 1:15:36.597
She's just as guarded
as you are.

1:15:36.633 --> 1:15:40.268
You, traveling everywhere,
living life on the road,

1:15:40.303 --> 1:15:42.336
not committing to anything
longer than a meal...

1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:45.706
This is your review
of my life?

1:15:45.742 --> 1:15:48.209
Mm-hmm.

1:15:48.244 --> 1:15:50.811
Well, whatever it was
that kept me in motion before,

1:15:50.847 --> 1:15:52.113
it just doesn't seem enough now.

1:15:52.148 --> 1:15:53.814
Ah, you fell for someone

1:15:53.850 --> 1:15:56.984
who's just as cautious
as you are.

1:15:57.020 --> 1:15:57.985
[sighing]

1:15:58.021 --> 1:16:00.521
the only problem is...
She might be the one.

1:16:01.991 --> 1:16:02.924
According to you?

1:16:04.594 --> 1:16:07.795
According to you
and that look on your face.

1:16:10.166 --> 1:16:12.333
Just give her time.

1:16:12.368 --> 1:16:13.701
Just be her friend.

1:16:15.438 --> 1:16:17.872
The rest will follow
when she's ready.

1:16:19.943 --> 1:16:21.409
So your review
has a happy ending.

1:16:21.444 --> 1:16:23.277
[chuckling]

1:16:23.313 --> 1:16:24.845
I am christina's mother,

1:16:24.881 --> 1:16:27.915
and I want
only the best for her...

1:16:27.951 --> 1:16:32.086
And I just happen to believe
that the best is you.

1:16:33.856 --> 1:16:37.858
We have 9,000 steps to go.

1:16:37.894 --> 1:16:39.594
So david asked me on a date.

1:16:39.629 --> 1:16:40.628
Uh-huh.

1:16:40.663 --> 1:16:41.963
And I said no.

1:16:41.998 --> 1:16:42.964
What?

1:16:42.999 --> 1:16:44.966
Because he's going away
after the holidays.

1:16:45.001 --> 1:16:46.000
Oh, for how long?

1:16:46.035 --> 1:16:47.134
I don't know.
He doesn't know.

1:16:47.170 --> 1:16:48.102
But that's not the point.

1:16:48.137 --> 1:16:50.204
Okay, what is the point?

1:16:50.239 --> 1:16:52.106
I'm really going to miss him.

1:16:53.910 --> 1:16:55.843
I know you're scared,

1:16:55.878 --> 1:16:57.845
but that's how you know
you have something real.

1:16:57.880 --> 1:16:59.213
When you take
that leap of faith,

1:16:59.248 --> 1:17:00.648
that could lead to love.

1:17:00.683 --> 1:17:02.116
I don't know.

1:17:02.151 --> 1:17:04.352
Maybe.

1:17:04.387 --> 1:17:08.289
I mean, what I did
is for the best,

1:17:08.324 --> 1:17:10.057
I'm sure of it...

1:17:10.093 --> 1:17:13.327
Except when I look
at my christmas tree,

1:17:13.363 --> 1:17:14.929
or my menorah,

1:17:14.964 --> 1:17:17.732
or a picture of him.

1:17:17.767 --> 1:17:19.166
Oh...

1:17:19.202 --> 1:17:20.167
If this is for the best,

1:17:20.203 --> 1:17:22.169
I'd hate to see
what dead wrong looks like.

1:17:22.205 --> 1:17:23.337

1:17:35.318 --> 1:17:36.283
[knocking]

1:17:40.556 --> 1:17:41.622
hi.

1:17:41.658 --> 1:17:43.824
There's something
I forgot to say,

1:17:43.860 --> 1:17:46.160
and I hope it's not too late.

1:17:46.195 --> 1:17:47.762
Okay.

1:17:47.797 --> 1:17:48.796
Come in.

1:17:58.708 --> 1:18:00.708
Now, we can take it
as slow as you want,

1:18:00.743 --> 1:18:04.011
but I need you to know
how much you matter to me.

1:18:04.047 --> 1:18:05.880
It's not that
I don't care for you.

1:18:05.915 --> 1:18:07.615
I do.

1:18:07.650 --> 1:18:10.151
I'm going on my trip,
and I'll be back in six weeks.

1:18:10.186 --> 1:18:12.019
And then I'm going
to settle down

1:18:12.055 --> 1:18:12.987
and write my book...

1:18:14.924 --> 1:18:15.923
Here, in cleveland.

1:18:17.694 --> 1:18:20.928
I called phil and told him
to find me a house.

1:18:23.099 --> 1:18:24.532
I am going all-out
to get this date.

1:18:27.704 --> 1:18:32.173
Okay, but are you sure
this is where you want to be?

1:18:32.208 --> 1:18:34.208
I want to be wherever you are.

1:18:34.243 --> 1:18:36.510
Come here.

1:18:46.022 --> 1:18:49.490
As incredibly complicated
holidays go,

1:18:49.525 --> 1:18:52.727
this one is turning out
really well.

1:19:10.046 --> 1:19:11.912
Christina, hi!

1:19:11.948 --> 1:19:13.214
Hi.

1:19:13.249 --> 1:19:14.215
Thank you for coming.

1:19:14.250 --> 1:19:16.250
Oh, yes. What can I do?

1:19:16.285 --> 1:19:17.251
Do you need help
in the kitchen?

1:19:17.286 --> 1:19:20.688
I... I just...I need help
making a phone call.

1:19:20.723 --> 1:19:23.424
Some moral support.

1:19:23.459 --> 1:19:25.726
I thought christmas eve
would be a nice time

1:19:25.762 --> 1:19:26.694
to call my father.

1:19:28.064 --> 1:19:29.029
Yeah.

1:19:30.066 --> 1:19:31.065
I'm here for you.

1:19:31.100 --> 1:19:32.600
Whatever you need.

1:19:38.307 --> 1:19:39.840
Okay.

1:19:41.277 --> 1:19:42.610
I'll be right here.

1:19:53.923 --> 1:19:55.422
Is giorgio there?

1:19:55.458 --> 1:19:56.624
Christina?

1:19:56.659 --> 1:19:58.959
Yes.

1:20:01.464 --> 1:20:02.863
I've been waiting
for your call.

1:20:05.635 --> 1:20:07.434
It's very nice to meet you.

1:20:07.470 --> 1:20:11.438
You are the most precious
surprise.

1:20:11.474 --> 1:20:13.174
You must come to Italy.

1:20:13.209 --> 1:20:16.644
<i> Will you?</i>

1:20:16.679 --> 1:20:18.813
I would like that very much.

1:20:24.387 --> 1:20:25.319
Merry christmas.

1:20:31.694 --> 1:20:34.328
Okay, so when
the restaurant reopens,

1:20:34.363 --> 1:20:36.630
I want to add
some new items to the menu

1:20:36.666 --> 1:20:39.633
to reflect both sides
of my heritage.

1:20:39.669 --> 1:20:41.969
She has another heritage?

1:20:42.004 --> 1:20:43.470
Yeah, christina
took a dna test,

1:20:43.506 --> 1:20:44.672
and it turns out
she's half-jewish.

1:20:44.707 --> 1:20:45.773
Oh.

1:20:45.808 --> 1:20:50.778
I have a brother, a sister,
and a biological mother.

1:20:50.813 --> 1:20:51.779
Aw, that's wonderful.

1:20:51.814 --> 1:20:53.047
Is... He your brother?

1:20:53.082 --> 1:20:54.715
No.

1:20:54.750 --> 1:20:55.683
That's david singer.

1:20:55.718 --> 1:20:57.284
The one who wrote the review.

1:20:57.320 --> 1:21:00.154
And he came back to make
the feast of the seven fishes?

1:21:00.189 --> 1:21:02.289
Aw, it's a long story.

1:21:09.398 --> 1:21:10.831
Hello.

1:21:10.867 --> 1:21:12.132
Hi, christina!

1:21:13.336 --> 1:21:14.368
Hi.

1:21:14.403 --> 1:21:15.970
I like your restaurant.

1:21:16.005 --> 1:21:17.404
You do?

1:21:17.440 --> 1:21:20.641
Well, I hope you come here
all the time.

1:21:20.676 --> 1:21:21.642
Hi.

1:21:21.677 --> 1:21:23.644
Merry christmas, christina.

1:21:23.679 --> 1:21:25.346
Happy holidays.

1:21:29.886 --> 1:21:32.086
Oh, christina,
it looks lovely.

This is what sophia
would want for you.

1:21:34.790 --> 1:21:36.223
Don't forget,

1:21:36.259 --> 1:21:38.025
your mother always made
a little toast, uh?

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:40.094
Mm-hmm. She did.

1:21:43.599 --> 1:21:44.565
hi.

1:21:46.035 --> 1:21:46.967
Wow.

1:21:49.572 --> 1:21:50.537
I spoke to my father.

1:21:51.941 --> 1:21:53.707
And he wants me
to come to Italy.

1:21:55.111 --> 1:21:56.043
Maybe we can go together.

1:21:57.980 --> 1:22:01.782
I think we can embrace
the old and the new,

1:22:01.817 --> 1:22:04.118
and I can celebrate
hanukkah and christmas

1:22:04.153 --> 1:22:06.220
every year.

1:22:06.255 --> 1:22:07.688
And I can do it with you.

tonight means to me.

this year.

I wanted to have
love in my life...

1:22:32.581 --> 1:22:34.448
And my wish came true.
