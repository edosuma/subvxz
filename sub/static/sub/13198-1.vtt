01:10.000 --> 01:12.500
It's raining today.

01:12.900 --> 01:14.800
Not playing in the yard.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.300
There will be plenty of mud.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.799
If you slip, you shall hurt you.

01:20.399 --> 01:22.199
-- Play inside.
-- Okay.

01:24.299 --> 01:26.499
And do not walk under the trees.

01:27.399 --> 01:29.098
A tree fell yesterday

01:29.398 --> 01:32.298
a bridge collapsed,
it was on the news.

01:32.698 --> 01:34.498
But it stopped raining.

01:35.598 --> 01:37.497
It can resume.

01:39.397 --> 01:40.497
Here it is.

01:40.797 --> 01:41.897
Wait!

01:43.897 --> 01:45.097
A minute!

02:14.594 --> 02:16.093
Thou hast put all the spices?

02:16.393 --> 02:18.693
No Auntie, I forgot one.

02:19.693 --> 02:21.793
I felt, the whistling!

02:23.293 --> 02:23.893
Want.

02:27.492 --> 02:28.892
Thank you, Auntie.

02:30.792 --> 02:32.692
Just a pinch.

02:32.992 --> 02:34.092
Okay.

02:35.891 --> 02:39.091
This new recipe will work.

02:39.391 --> 02:40.191
Are you sure?

02:40.391 --> 02:42.891
You doubt,

02:43.191 --> 02:44.690
but you'll see.

02:47.390 --> 02:49.590
Yum ... perfect!

02:50.290 --> 02:54.289
A mouthful,
and he will build you a Taj Mahal.

02:54.789 --> 02:56.489
The Taj Mahal is a tomb.

02:56.989 --> 02:58.489
I know!

03:05.088 --> 03:06.288
Retrieves them.

06:26.667 --> 06:27.467
Fernandes.

06:28.167 --> 06:30.967
I present Shaikh.
Shaikh, Mr Fernandes.

06:31.167 --> 06:34.267
He was chief accountant
in a small Saudi company.

06:34.466 --> 06:37.166
He will take your notes to your departure
in one month.

06:37.566 --> 06:39.266
It has very good references.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.366
Delighted.

06:41.366 --> 06:43.166
Mr. Shroff fill you with praise.

06:43.366 --> 06:46.565
I did come early
for you to truly form.

06:48.765 --> 06:49.665
Good luck.

06:54.764 --> 06:58.664
Mr. Shroff said it 35 years
you're here.

06:59.964 --> 07:02.564
Your colleagues will miss you.

07:04.363 --> 07:07.463
What does it do?

07:08.763 --> 07:12.463
This is the beginning of your golden age,
how do you feel?

07:13.462 --> 07:14.362
Beautifully.

07:14.562 --> 07:15.862
Awesome!

07:28.561 --> 07:30.261
Can we start training?

07:33.760 --> 07:34.860
Course.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.260
But it's lunchtime.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.259
Return to 16 h 45.

07:45.659 --> 07:47.659
Well, at any hour.

07:47.959 --> 07:48.959
Thank you!

10:00.745 --> 10:04.945
<i> Today
the recipe for one of my favorite dishes: </ i></i>

10:05.145 --> 10:06.644
<i> "paneer pyaza do." </ i></i>

10:36.741 --> 10:38.041
Auntie!

10:38.741 --> 10:40.941
-- Do you sleep?
-- What happened?

10:41.141 --> 10:43.041
The lunchbox is back.

10:43.341 --> 10:44.940
Then?

10:45.540 --> 10:46.840
It is empty.

10:47.140 --> 10:48.440
Is that true?

10:48.640 --> 10:49.640
Completely!

10:50.240 --> 10:52.540
It all sauced!

10:54.939 --> 10:58.439
What did I tell you?
And this is just the beginning!

13:03.026 --> 13:05.426
Stops the tape,
Rajeev is back.

13:05.626 --> 13:06.526
Okay.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.425
You're home early, the better.

13:27.923 --> 13:29.523
Did you like your breakfast?

13:29.723 --> 13:30.623
It was good.

13:35.723 --> 13:38.222
Well ... no more?

13:39.122 --> 13:40.922
As everyday.

13:41.822 --> 13:47.221
The lunchbox was empty,
then I thought ...

13:48.021 --> 13:50.621
Cauliflower was very good.

14:02.520 --> 14:03.720
It was very good.

14:07.219 --> 14:08.219
I just got back.

14:09.719 --> 14:11.419
I was expecting your call.

14:16.818 --> 14:18.418
It was so boring?

14:23.518 --> 14:24.917
I left early too.

14:47.215 --> 14:48.815
A problem, sir?

14:49.715 --> 14:51.515
I retire.

14:51.715 --> 14:53.814
I would like to stop delivery.

14:54.114 --> 14:56.814
Okay, I take note.

14:57.614 --> 14:59.814
I will pay you at the end of the month.

15:00.214 --> 15:01.814
No problem.

15:03.513 --> 15:06.613
And. .. who cooked today?

15:07.713 --> 15:11.013
Us, why?

15:11.213 --> 15:12.912
It was good!

15:14.212 --> 15:16.212
-- What?
-- It was very good.

15:17.012 --> 15:18.812
Continue on this path.

15:25.811 --> 15:26.811
What has?

15:27.011 --> 15:28.711
Cauliflower liked him.

15:28.911 --> 15:30.511
Do it again tomorrow.

15:30.711 --> 15:32.010
Like, serve it.

15:44.509 --> 15:45.609
What do you do?

15:49.509 --> 15:53.408
Mr. Fernandes, our ball fell
at home. It can recover?

15:53.608 --> 15:54.708
Please!

16:01.007 --> 16:03.107
-- I look like a maid?
-- No.

16:03.707 --> 16:06.407
It will no longer play here.
We'll go to the other side.

16:06.707 --> 16:10.206
If you replay here, I hunt you.

16:11.906 --> 16:12.906
Please!

16:14.106 --> 16:15.906
We'll play somewhere else!

16:54.602 --> 16:55.802
I'm here, Auntie.

16:56.002 --> 16:57.802
You called me just now?

16:58.401 --> 16:59.001
Yes.

16:59.301 --> 17:01.401
I changed diapers Tonton.

17:02.601 --> 17:03.801
Rajeev has said?

17:05.800 --> 17:06.701
Nothing.

17:07.101 --> 17:08.000
What?

17:09.400 --> 17:12.200
The lunchbox was delivered elsewhere.

17:13.099 --> 17:15.900
I do not think Rajeev has received it.

17:16.099 --> 17:18.199
Someone else ate the meal.

17:18.398 --> 17:22.699
But they are never wrong,
impossible.

17:28.498 --> 17:29.598
What does he?

18:39.491 --> 18:41.191
Hello, how are you?

18:41.491 --> 18:42.691
Good morning.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.890
When I returned,
you were not there.

18:47.090 --> 18:50.090
-- You were late.
-- I came to 16 h 45 accurate.

18:50.290 --> 18:51.990
I was there, you were late.

18:52.190 --> 18:53.789
No problem.

18:58.889 --> 19:00.389
These are the claims?

19:01.689 --> 19:03.588
It is the claims service here.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.688
When do we start my training?

19:08.888 --> 19:09.988
Let's go.

19:14.687 --> 19:15.587
Now?

19:16.087 --> 19:17.487
After lunch.

19:18.387 --> 19:20.987
-- I'll be back after then?
-- Yes, come.

19:21.187 --> 19:22.786
-- Are you sure?
-- Yes.

19:22.986 --> 19:24.486
You will be right there?

19:26.486 --> 19:27.786
Thank you.

20:56.577 --> 20:58.976
<i> Thank you all ate yesterday. </ i></i>

20:59.476 --> 21:02.576
<i> I cooked this dish for my husband. </ i></i>

21:03.176 --> 21:04.476
<i> Seeing the empty box, </ i></i>

21:04.976 --> 21:07.575
<i> I thought it welcome me
coming back. </ i></i>

21:08.375 --> 21:10.075
<i> I thought,
Within a few hours </ i></i>

21:10.275 --> 21:12.175
<i> that satisfy the stomach,
it was to seduce the heart. </ i></i>

21:12.375 --> 21:13.875
<i> thank you </ i></i>

21:14.075 --> 21:15.375
<i> here paneer. </ i></i>

21:16.275 --> 21:17.374
<i> favorite dish of my husband. </ i></i>

21:23.074 --> 21:25.874
Auntie, this letter is weird.

21:26.274 --> 21:28.473
Ila, you should thank him.

21:30.173 --> 21:31.973
And if it is Rajeev who receives?

21:32.173 --> 21:33.373
Better.

21:33.873 --> 21:36.972
He eats meals someone else.

21:37.272 --> 21:39.172
His noticing today!

21:43.372 --> 21:44.772
I do not write anything else?

21:44.972 --> 21:47.171
No, it should remain short!

22:13.469 --> 22:14.668
You sleep?

22:14.868 --> 22:15.768
Then?

22:16.868 --> 22:18.368
The lunchbox is back.

22:18.568 --> 22:21.568
Empty yet. With a reply.

22:21.968 --> 22:23.568
-- A response?
-- Yes.

22:23.768 --> 22:25.167
Read it to me.

22:25.367 --> 22:27.467
This is not writing Rajeev.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.167
And what does it say then?

22:30.167 --> 22:33.267
"Dear Ila. Food
today was very salty. "

22:33.467 --> 22:34.466
And what else?

22:34.666 --> 22:37.166
"The food
today was very salty. "

22:37.366 --> 22:39.466
What? No "thank you", no?

22:40.066 --> 22:42.366
"The food
today was very salty. "

22:42.566 --> 22:46.465
Who does it?
It swallows everything and he complains?

22:46.865 --> 22:48.065
A minute.

22:50.865 --> 22:52.365
Here, put--in.

22:54.064 --> 22:55.864
No, it bothers me.

22:56.064 --> 22:59.364
I say to the driver
there was an error.

23:00.064 --> 23:01.964
It should thank you!

23:02.164 --> 23:04.863
No, I really do not like it.

23:05.063 --> 23:06.963
Why? You do not know.

23:20.662 --> 23:22.661
Good morning. How are you?

23:23.461 --> 23:24.361
Property.

23:29.161 --> 23:32.660
You were not at your desk,
I came here.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.760
You read in the canteen,
I do not want to bother.

23:43.959 --> 23:46.259
Your meal exhales a delicious aroma.

23:46.459 --> 23:49.459
I tasted the food
just by feeling!

23:58.158 --> 23:59.658
Your wife ...

24:00.757 --> 24:02.657
has magic in his hands.

24:04.357 --> 24:05.957
My wife is dead.

27:00.139 --> 27:03.238
<i> Dear Ila, salt,
it was this time. </ i></i>

27:03.438 --> 27:05.938
<i> It was perhaps a little spicy ... </ i></i>

27:06.438 --> 27:10.438
<i> but I ate two bananas for dessert,
they extinguished the fire. </ i></i>

27:11.538 --> 27:14.137
<i> And it's good for my circulation. </ i></i>

27:19.237 --> 27:20.137
<i> So many people </ i></i>

27:20.337 --> 27:23.136
<i> simply a banana or two
at noon. </ i></i>

27:25.636 --> 27:27.236
<i> It's cheap and it fills. </ i></i>

27:47.434 --> 27:48.334
<i> Hello. </ i></i>

27:49.434 --> 27:50.933
<i> My husband came home late last night. </ i></i>

27:53.233 --> 27:54.633
<i> He did not say a word. </ i></i>

27:58.433 --> 28:01.532
<i> This morning, he went to work,
and my daughter to school. </ i></i>

28:01.832 --> 28:05.432
<i> And I cooked with Auntie Deshpande. </ i></i>

28:06.132 --> 28:09.331
<i> This is our upstairs neighbor. </ i></i>

28:10.031 --> 28:12.831
Her husband is immersed <i>
in a coma for 15 years. </ i></i>

28:13.631 --> 28:17.131
<i> One day he woke up
and began to fix the fan. </ i></i>

28:18.231 --> 28:22.330
<i> fixed all day </ i></i>

28:22.630 --> 28:24.330
<i> and falls asleep at night. </ i></i>

28:24.830 --> 28:27.930
<i> Upon awakening, he went back to fix it. </ i></i>

28:28.130 --> 28:29.529
<i> He said nothing. </ i></i>

28:30.029 --> 28:32.129
<i> For 15 years. </ i></i>

28:32.629 --> 28:35.129
<i> Even doctors have lost all hope. </ i></i>

28:35.829 --> 28:38.328
<i> This is an old model fan. </ i></i>

28:39.228 --> 28:41.028
<i> It is never extinguished. </ i></i>

28:41.628 --> 28:45.728
Auntie <i> think it keeps him alive. </ i></i>

28:46.628 --> 28:48.927
<i> One day, there was
a power outage. </ i></i>

28:49.927 --> 28:52.427
<i> He stopped
and his pulse slowed. </ i></i>

28:52.627 --> 28:54.727
<i> Fortunately, the electricity came back. </ i></i>

28:59.826 --> 29:02.926
<i> since Auntie installed a generator. </ i></i>

29:05.026 --> 29:07.525
Her husband continues <i>
attach the fan. </ i></i>

29:07.725 --> 29:09.325
<i> mine fixed his phone. </ i></i>

29:09.525 --> 29:10.925
<i> as if nothing else existed. </ i></i>

29:12.925 --> 29:14.525
<i> This may be the case. </ i></i>

29:19.024 --> 29:20.524
What do we live?

29:33.023 --> 29:35.822
<i> Dear Ila,
Your husband seems to be busy. </ I></i>

29:36.022 --> 29:37.822
<i> Today
people are very busy. </ i></i>

29:38.022 --> 29:39.222
<i> There are too many people, </ i></i>

29:39.422 --> 29:41.722
<i> and everyone wants
that the other features. </ i></i>

29:43.622 --> 29:47.221
<i> Before, you could
sit in the train, </ i></i>

29:47.421 --> 29:49.221
<i> but nowadays, it's hard. </ i></i>

29:49.421 --> 29:51.621
<i> If Mr. Deshpande was waking up, </ i></i>

29:51.821 --> 29:55.520
<i> it probably prefer
his fan. </ i></i>

29:57.920 --> 30:01.020
<i> When my wife died,
she had a horizontal fall. </ i></i>

30:01.720 --> 30:05.519
<i> I wanted to buy one for me,
but they had </ i></i>

30:05.719 --> 30:07.119
<i> as vertical. </ i></i>

30:08.019 --> 30:10.319
<i> I spent my whole life standing. </ i></i>

30:10.619 --> 30:13.119
<i> It will be the same in my death. </ i></i>

30:16.118 --> 30:18.118
<i> Why do not you
another child? </ i></i>

30:19.618 --> 30:22.718
<i> It can sometimes help a marriage. </ i></i>

30:43.315 --> 30:44.515
Rajeev?

30:45.315 --> 30:46.615
What do you say?

30:47.215 --> 30:48.315
It's pretty.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.414
You forgot?

30:55.014 --> 30:57.614
I reach
during our honeymoon.

30:58.414 --> 31:02.513
I wanted to see
if she needed alterations.

31:02.913 --> 31:05.913
But it suits me very well,

31:06.113 --> 31:07.313
-- Right?
-- Yes.

31:07.513 --> 31:09.013
It is a little wide.

31:09.213 --> 31:10.313
Yes ...

31:15.612 --> 31:19.512
On our return, we did not know
Yashvi that happened.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.011
It was known much later.

31:23.311 --> 31:25.311
Two months later!

31:40.309 --> 31:43.109
We did not have much
at the time.

31:47.909 --> 31:50.608
When she was born,
luck smiled on us.

31:51.208 --> 31:54.608
Everything is so expensive today,
luck is not enough.

31:55.308 --> 31:57.708
Why you prepare me
cauliflower every day?

31:58.008 --> 31:59.507
You have a stock to sell?

32:11.806 --> 32:12.706
Rajeev.

32:14.606 --> 32:17.906
And if Yashvi had a little brother
or sister?

32:18.106 --> 32:19.705
You had a brother you.

32:21.205 --> 32:22.305
And ...

32:26.605 --> 32:30.904
I pray thee, over cauliflower,
it gives me gas.

33:29.798 --> 33:32.098
Cars, buses, airplanes:

33:32.398 --> 33:34.698
all trapped in Mumbai we are.

33:35.697 --> 33:37.797
This road is bottled
since this morning.

33:38.797 --> 33:41.897
You see this tower?

33:42.797 --> 33:45.896
A woman jumped this morning
with his little girl.

33:49.296 --> 33:51.096
She jumped?

33:53.996 --> 33:55.295
What was it?

33:55.995 --> 33:58.795
I do not know.
I do not know.

34:02.995 --> 34:05.294
Surely domestic problems.

34:06.394 --> 34:08.793
You know someone
who lives there?

34:11.194 --> 34:12.594
She did not survive?

35:37.885 --> 35:38.985
<i> Hello. </ i></i>

35:39.585 --> 35:41.684
<i> this morning
my husband went to the office ... </ i></i>

35:41.984 --> 35:44.284
Hello, sir.
How are you?

35:45.384 --> 35:46.684
I'm busy.

35:48.184 --> 35:49.783
And my training?

35:49.983 --> 35:53.083
It's lunchtime.
Check back later.

36:01.282 --> 36:04.082
I was told to expect nothing
on your part.

36:10.081 --> 36:12.981
I'm Aslam Shaikh.
I'm an orphan.

36:14.581 --> 36:16.581
I gave myself that name.

36:17.381 --> 36:19.980
All I know
I taught myself.

36:20.180 --> 36:22.780
And I also teach this work.
I finished. Thank you.

36:24.980 --> 36:25.880
Listen.

36:28.279 --> 36:29.379
Come on.

36:38.378 --> 36:39.678
Go to my office.

36:39.978 --> 36:42.778
There are records
of Ahmedabad sector.

36:42.978 --> 36:44.178
Calculate the amounts

36:44.378 --> 36:46.678
and prepare payment orders
for accounting.

36:47.677 --> 36:49.077
Thank you very much.

36:51.177 --> 36:52.277
Thank you very much.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.377
I'll be right back.

36:54.577 --> 36:56.777
No, do not come back, go to work.

36:56.976 --> 36:58.776
Yes sir, thank you very much.

37:04.276 --> 37:07.775
<i> This morning my husband went to the office
and Yashvi school. </ i></i>

37:07.975 --> 37:11.075
<i> I listened to the news on the radio. </ i></i>

37:12.075 --> 37:14.675
<i> the death of my brother,
everyone said: </ i></i>

37:15.075 --> 37:16.874
<i> he should be brave. </ i></i>

37:17.274 --> 37:19.574
<i> He missed his exams, so what? </ i></i>

37:20.374 --> 37:21.774
<i> He should be brave. </ i></i>

37:23.174 --> 37:24.874
What <i> thought this woman? </ i></i>

37:27.673 --> 37:29.773
<i> Maybe she has removed her jewelry ... </ i></i>

37:30.573 --> 37:32.573
<i> Bracelets, earrings, </ i></i>

37:33.573 --> 37:35.073
<i> wedding necklace ... </ i></i>

37:36.372 --> 37:38.572
What <i> asked his daughter? </ i></i>

37:38.772 --> 37:40.472
We play what, Mom?

37:45.671 --> 37:48.671
<i> It must have been difficult
reaching to the roof. </ i></i>

37:52.371 --> 37:55.270
<i> Must we not courage
to jump as well? </ i></i>

38:02.370 --> 38:04.569
<i> Dear Ila,
do not see it that way. </ i></i>

38:04.769 --> 38:07.569
They never go <i>
as bad as you think. </ i></i>

38:07.769 --> 38:10.869
<i> One day on the train
taking me to work, </ i></i>

38:11.069 --> 38:13.269
<i> I suddenly felt something. </ i></i>

38:14.668 --> 38:15.968
<i> Someone touched me ... </ i></i>

38:16.668 --> 38:17.968
<i> down ... </ i></i>

39:04.863 --> 39:06.363
You laugh?

39:07.963 --> 39:08.963
Yes, Auntie.

39:10.763 --> 39:11.962
A joke.

39:12.162 --> 39:13.762
Tell!

39:13.962 --> 39:15.062
I forgot.

39:15.262 --> 39:16.762
-- You forgot?
-- Yes.

39:17.362 --> 39:19.662
Soak almonds 5 am every night.

39:19.862 --> 39:21.861
And eat them in the morning.

39:22.061 --> 39:23.561
It strengthens memory.

39:23.761 --> 39:25.361
Noted.

39:30.860 --> 39:32.360
How are you?

39:33.460 --> 39:35.660
-- You go to the station?
-- Yes.

39:37.660 --> 39:39.859
I get off at Central Station
Bombay.

39:40.059 --> 39:42.359
I live in Dongri.

39:42.559 --> 39:43.459
And you?

39:43.659 --> 39:44.759
At Bandra.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.258
Can I ask you a question?

39:56.158 --> 39:57.058
Yes.

40:00.657 --> 40:02.757
At the office, it is said that walking ...

40:08.057 --> 40:10.756
you gave a kick
a cat.

40:13.556 --> 40:17.456
A bus has crashed and you have continued
your way, nonchalantly.

40:18.655 --> 40:19.655
Is that true?

40:22.355 --> 40:24.955
It was not a cat.
But a blind man.

40:25.155 --> 40:26.355
He asked his way,

40:26.555 --> 40:29.354
so I pushed
and a coach ran into him.

40:37.753 --> 40:39.153
So be careful.

40:42.553 --> 40:43.653
Thank you.

40:46.953 --> 40:48.452
Give me a cigarette.

40:49.652 --> 40:51.052
I'll pay later.

40:55.152 --> 40:56.651
This is a joke, right?

40:58.351 --> 41:01.151
Have you always lived in Bandra?

41:03.051 --> 41:04.651
Yes, always.

41:06.850 --> 41:08.350
I move constantly.

41:09.450 --> 41:11.650
At first, I was way Muhammad Ali.

41:11.950 --> 41:15.050
Then I went to Dubai,
then in Saudi Arabia.

41:16.149 --> 41:18.349
I was commuting
between there and here.

41:18.549 --> 41:22.249
But after meeting Meherunissa,
I stayed.

41:24.349 --> 41:25.848
I cut vegetables here

41:26.048 --> 41:29.048
and I cook when I get home.

41:29.248 --> 41:31.248
Where did you learn to do that?

41:32.348 --> 41:34.248
Before I worked in a hotel.

41:34.947 --> 41:36.147
A hotel?

41:36.347 --> 41:39.847
Kitchen, room service,
accounting ...

41:40.147 --> 41:41.847
All in one.

41:43.247 --> 41:45.246
It is dry in Saudi Arabia.

41:45.746 --> 41:49.546
No entertainment:
work--prayer, prayer--work ...

41:49.746 --> 41:52.046
Here I have free time.

41:52.746 --> 41:58.245
I cook for Meherunissa,
we eat when she gets home.

41:58.945 --> 42:01.745
-- And then we walk.
-- Very well.

42:05.844 --> 42:07.644
I love her more than anything.

42:10.244 --> 42:11.744
That evening you doing?

42:14.943 --> 42:18.443
I watch TV sometimes.

42:27.342 --> 42:28.942
Come to me.

42:29.842 --> 42:31.442
-- Where?
-- My house.

42:34.041 --> 42:35.941
I will make you a "Pasanda".

42:36.141 --> 42:38.241
-- A what?
-- "Pasanda".

42:38.441 --> 42:41.741
-- What is it?
-- A dish made with lamb.

42:41.941 --> 42:44.940
You cut it like that.

42:45.140 --> 42:47.040
-- From the lamb?
-- Yes.

42:48.040 --> 42:49.240
My specialty.

42:49.840 --> 42:50.840
I will come.

42:51.040 --> 42:52.539
-- Now.
-- Right now?

42:52.739 --> 42:53.839
Yes, please!

42:55.339 --> 42:59.839
No, I work another time.

43:01.438 --> 43:03.438
Next time promised?

43:04.538 --> 43:06.038
I can wait ...

43:06.238 --> 43:07.438
Next time.

43:09.238 --> 43:11.237
-- See you soon.
-- Goodbye.

43:55.533 --> 43:58.633
<i> Hello.
My husband came home late yesterday. </ I></i>

43:59.132 --> 44:01.232
<i> He returned to work
after a call. </ i></i>

44:01.532 --> 44:03.132
<i> Yashvi asleep. </ i></i>

44:03.932 --> 44:07.832
<i> my marriage, I took business
without telling my mother. </ i></i>

44:08.731 --> 44:11.231
<i> I found an old book. </ i></i>

44:12.131 --> 44:14.031
<i> It contains recipes
my grandmother. </ i></i>

44:14.231 --> 44:16.031
<i> I found an apple. </ i></i>

44:16.231 --> 44:17.531
<i> Tis the season. </ i></i>

44:18.830 --> 44:21.030
<i> I think you'll like it. </ i></i>

44:22.530 --> 44:23.730
Excellent!

44:24.330 --> 44:25.530
How are you?

44:26.230 --> 44:27.430
I can sit?

44:28.329 --> 44:29.329
Please.

44:29.829 --> 44:30.629
Thank you.

44:37.928 --> 44:40.228
Want a taste?

44:41.128 --> 44:42.228
Are you sure?

44:43.128 --> 44:44.128
Yes.

45:05.926 --> 45:06.925
What does he?

45:10.325 --> 45:11.725
Where does this meal?

45:12.525 --> 45:16.624
A restaurant near me.

45:17.724 --> 45:18.724
Why?

45:19.924 --> 45:21.024
It is delicious.

45:22.024 --> 45:24.924
Book a meal for me.

45:25.923 --> 45:27.223
They close soon.

45:27.823 --> 45:30.023
With food so delicious?

45:30.223 --> 45:32.923
The talent is not rewarded
in this country.

45:35.622 --> 45:39.422
You are right, sir.

45:39.922 --> 45:41.522
It must be magic
in his hands.

45:41.722 --> 45:45.221
Everyone can cook,
but it must be magic.

45:59.220 --> 46:03.320
<i> Dear Ila,
this recipe was very good. </ i></i>

46:03.919 --> 46:06.519
<i> Better than my favorite dish,
eggplant. </ i></i>

46:06.719 --> 46:09.719
<i> Yesterday, I also
found something. </ i></i>

46:10.319 --> 46:13.418
<i> old emissions
my wife recorded. </ i></i>

46:14.718 --> 46:18.118
You probably were <i>
not yet born at the time. </ i></i>

46:25.517 --> 46:27.117
<i> My wife loved them. </ i></i>

46:27.717 --> 46:30.217
<i> I wanted to watch,
who knows why. </ i></i>

46:30.917 --> 46:32.716
<i> I have watched for hours. </ i></i>

46:33.816 --> 46:37.216
<i> Episode after episode. </ i></i>

46:39.316 --> 46:41.616
<i> After spending the night </ i></i>

46:41.915 --> 46:44.615
<i> I understood what I was looking for. </ i></i>

46:45.615 --> 46:48.015
<i> Every Sunday
while she watched, </ i></i>

46:48.215 --> 46:51.514
<i> I stood outside,
fix my bike or smoke. </ i></i>

46:51.714 --> 46:54.514
<i> I threw him a glance
from time to time. </ i></i>

46:55.414 --> 46:58.614
<i> And I saw his reflection on the screen, </ i></i>

46:58.814 --> 47:02.913
<i> still laughing at the jokes ... </ i></i>

47:03.113 --> 47:05.813
<i> she knew by heart. </ i></i>

47:09.213 --> 47:12.912
<i> If only I had continued
to look at the time ... </ i></i>

47:22.811 --> 47:25.511
I forwarded
all payment orders.

47:30.110 --> 47:32.210
An apple and a banana for you.

47:34.710 --> 47:35.610
Go ahead.

47:35.810 --> 47:37.010
No, sir.

47:37.710 --> 47:38.910
I insist.

47:41.109 --> 47:42.009
Okay.

47:48.709 --> 47:50.308
What is that?

47:51.008 --> 47:52.008
A leaf.

48:01.307 --> 48:03.407
Can I have some water,
please?

48:06.007 --> 48:07.607
Then, right?

48:08.107 --> 48:09.206
I love it.

48:10.106 --> 48:11.006
Thank you.

48:17.506 --> 48:20.805
Today, we no longer send
letters. As emails.

48:21.305 --> 48:22.405
More letters?

48:25.105 --> 48:26.605
This is the era of emails.

48:32.704 --> 48:33.904
<i> Hello. </ i></i>

48:34.104 --> 48:37.003
My mother loves <i>
old serials. </ i></i>

48:37.503 --> 48:40.603
Small <i>, I watched
for hours. </ i></i>

48:41.603 --> 48:43.403
<i> I wanted to tell you something. </ i></i>

48:44.003 --> 48:46.802
<i> Each cigarette smoke,
it is 5 min of life and less. </ i></i>

48:47.102 --> 48:48.902
<i> My father has lung cancer. </ i></i>

48:49.302 --> 48:54.402
<i> When he suffers too,
he said he would have to smoke more </ i></i>

48:54.602 --> 48:56.901
<i> for not
to deal with this pain. </ i></i>

48:57.901 --> 48:59.201
<i> Do not blame me. </ i></i>

49:48.896 --> 49:50.196
Yes, Auntie?

49:50.596 --> 49:52.196
You have my carrots?

49:52.396 --> 49:54.595
They are there.

49:55.695 --> 49:56.795
Here!

49:59.195 --> 50:01.295
They cost only 10 rupees.

50:01.995 --> 50:03.295
What have you taken other?

50:05.094 --> 50:06.894
As usual.

50:09.094 --> 50:13.993
<i> What other food can you cook
based eggplant? </ i></i>

50:14.293 --> 50:18.293
<i> can fry them, stuff them,
bake ... </ i></i>

51:19.087 --> 51:20.986
It follows a new treatment.

51:21.286 --> 51:25.186
It helps,
but he sleeps all day.

51:30.385 --> 51:32.185
Mom? Where's the TV?

51:32.685 --> 51:35.385
There are currently more good emissions
nowadays.

51:39.484 --> 51:41.884
You need money?

51:42.284 --> 51:44.084
It comes out.

51:46.284 --> 51:48.983
This treatment is very expensive.

51:49.183 --> 51:53.483
It's OK, I got it.

51:53.983 --> 51:57.083
But how?
Where do you find the money?

52:02.182 --> 52:05.882
If my son was there,
I would not have to beg.

52:10.081 --> 52:11.881
I'll talk to Rajeev.

52:12.081 --> 52:14.481
It's no go.

52:17.880 --> 52:21.180
I ask 5000.

52:21.880 --> 52:23.080
It is the family of the bride.

52:23.280 --> 52:26.280
What was the air
to ask all this money?

52:27.879 --> 52:31.279
You can pay little by little.

52:31.479 --> 52:32.579
No.

52:33.879 --> 52:35.779
I have money.

52:38.078 --> 52:39.578
I got it.

52:47.977 --> 52:49.177
Well, okay.

52:50.077 --> 52:51.877
But do not tell your father.

52:52.677 --> 52:55.177
The 5000 should be sufficient

52:55.877 --> 52:57.376
for this month.

52:58.376 --> 53:00.576
Next month
else be found.

53:08.575 --> 53:09.775
You wanna see it?

53:10.675 --> 53:11.375
I wake up?

53:13.575 --> 53:15.274
It's late, we must go back.

53:15.474 --> 53:16.474
Okay.

54:07.269 --> 54:08.569
<i> Dear Ila, </ i></i>

54:08.769 --> 54:11.169
You will not believe <i>
what happened to me yesterday. </ i></i>

54:13.568 --> 54:16.068
<i> the evening, on my way to the station
with Shaikh, </ i></i>

54:16.668 --> 54:18.568
<i> my colleague, </ i></i>

54:19.368 --> 54:22.367
<i> the urge took me
look at the paintings of an artist. </ i></i>

54:22.867 --> 54:25.367
<i> They are all identical. </ i></i>

54:26.067 --> 54:28.367
<i> But if you look closer, </ i></i>

54:29.067 --> 54:32.666
<i> we note that each
is slightly different. </ i></i>

54:32.866 --> 54:36.266
Here <i> a car and more
there a man who dreams in a bus. </ i></i>

54:37.066 --> 54:39.066
<i> Or a dog crossing the street. </ i></i>

54:39.266 --> 54:41.865
<i> What caught the attention of the painter. </ i></i>

54:42.365 --> 54:43.965
<i> And on one of them, </ i></i>

54:44.365 --> 54:45.765
<i> I saw. </ i></i>

54:47.465 --> 54:49.465
<i> At least I think that's me. </ i></i>

54:50.865 --> 54:53.364
<i> Then I offered
a "rickshaw." </ i></i>

54:55.064 --> 54:57.764
<i> houses of my childhood friends </ i></i>

54:58.064 --> 54:59.064
<i> all disappeared. </ i></i>

54:59.264 --> 55:00.963
<i> My old school too. </ i></i>

55:03.063 --> 55:05.163
<i> But some things have remained. </ i></i>

55:06.163 --> 55:08.163
<i> old post, </ i></i>

55:08.663 --> 55:10.462
<i> and the hospital where I was born </ i></i>

55:10.662 --> 55:13.762
<i> and where my parents are dead,
and my wife. </ i></i>

55:17.862 --> 55:21.861
<i> I think we forget things
if there is nobody to tell them. </ i></i>

55:22.061 --> 55:23.761
Pardon, sir?

55:23.961 --> 55:26.161
-- What?
-- You told me?

55:27.161 --> 55:27.861
No.

55:43.459 --> 55:44.759
What do you play?

55:45.259 --> 55:46.659
In Blind Man's Bluff.

55:51.458 --> 55:54.358
-- You know what I was playing at your age?
-- What?

55:56.758 --> 55:58.457
Let's remove it first.

55:58.657 --> 56:00.157
I do?

56:01.057 --> 56:02.457
I got it.

56:07.157 --> 56:09.656
We played at home.

56:13.256 --> 56:14.856
That was the baby.

56:15.356 --> 56:16.956
I was the father.

56:17.256 --> 56:22.155
And your uncle was the mother, wife.

57:14.949 --> 57:16.149
<i> Hello. </ i></i>

57:17.049 --> 57:18.749
<i> I want to tell you something. </ i></i>

57:18.949 --> 57:21.149
<i> I think my husband is having an affair. </ i></i>

57:21.349 --> 57:23.149
At first I thought <i> confront. </ i></i>

57:23.449 --> 57:25.548
<i> But I have not had the courage. </ i></i>

57:25.748 --> 57:27.548
<i> Where would I go? </ i></i>

57:28.648 --> 57:30.148
<i> There is one place ... </ i></i>

57:31.248 --> 57:34.447
<i> My daughter has learned in Bhutan,
everyone is happy. </ i></i>

57:35.147 --> 57:38.747
They do not have <i> GNP
but Gross National Happiness. </ i></i>

57:42.747 --> 57:45.146
<i> Would not it be wonderful
to have it here? </ i></i>

58:25.342 --> 58:26.342
Madame.

58:52.039 --> 58:56.739
<i> if I came to Bhutan with you? </ i></i>

58:59.839 --> 59:02.338
You seem distracted.

59:04.738 --> 59:07.538
-- I made a mistake?
-- No.

59:13.137 --> 59:14.537
Tell me, Shaikh ...

59:15.237 --> 59:16.137
Yes?

59:17.637 --> 59:20.836
-- Have you ever been to Bhutan?
-- Bhutan?

59:22.536 --> 59:26.836
I thought ... rather than Nasik,
I could move there.

59:28.236 --> 59:31.835
I have been in Saudi Arabia.
Bhutan, that's fine too.

59:32.035 --> 59:36.835
It has advantages:
1 rupee is 5 there.

59:37.835 --> 59:39.534
It's worth going there.

59:42.134 --> 59:45.534
My mother said ... she always says:

59:46.034 --> 59:49.333
"The wrong train
can take you to the right station. "

59:51.733 --> 59:53.133
Your mother?

59:57.833 --> 59:59.532
You told me that you were an orphan.

59:59.732 --> 01:00:01.132
This is true,

01:00:01.332 --> 01:00:03.632
but when I say:
"My mother always says ..."

01:00:03.832 --> 01:00:07.132
people take me seriously.
It feels good.

01:00:14.731 --> 01:00:15.631
That is correct.

01:00:27.429 --> 01:00:30.329
You're listening to Radio <i> Bhutan ... </ i></i>

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:05.725
<i> How could we go together
Bhutan? </ i></i>

01:01:06.025 --> 01:01:08.025
<i> I do not even know your name. </ i></i>

01:01:21.024 --> 01:01:22.324
How are you?

01:01:31.123 --> 01:01:32.623
A banana and an apple.

01:01:35.022 --> 01:01:36.422
Try this.

01:01:39.922 --> 01:01:42.522
You are radiant today.

01:01:42.722 --> 01:01:44.621
Whether he comes?

01:01:48.221 --> 01:01:50.721
You lost 10 years.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:05.919
Your mother said that the wrong train
can take you to the right station ...

01:02:07.719 --> 01:02:09.719
-- My mother is always right.
-- So?

01:02:10.419 --> 01:02:11.619
I love it.

01:02:12.418 --> 01:02:13.618
Variety.

01:02:13.818 --> 01:02:15.118
Variety, sir.

01:02:29.617 --> 01:02:30.917
Auntie!

01:02:35.616 --> 01:02:37.116
What does he?

01:02:40.816 --> 01:02:43.415
Would you have the cassette of this film,
"Saajan"?

01:02:43.615 --> 01:02:46.115
So, why?

01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:49.715
The songs were good, right?

01:02:51.014 --> 01:02:52.114
Not bad.

01:02:55.714 --> 01:02:57.314
We can hear it?

01:02:58.214 --> 01:02:59.314
Now?

01:03:01.013 --> 01:03:01.913
Yes.

01:03:02.513 --> 01:03:04.113
You can put it?

01:03:05.413 --> 01:03:06.813
I put it.

01:04:12.406 --> 01:04:13.506
<i> Hello, </ i></i>

01:04:14.306 --> 01:04:19.105
<i> Yesterday Auntie put the cassette
Film "Saajan". Funny coincidence. </ I></i>

01:04:20.005 --> 01:04:22.805
<i> She tapes
of all Indian movies, </ i></i>

01:04:23.005 --> 01:04:25.705
<i> but no CD or MP3. </ i></i>

01:04:26.305 --> 01:04:29.204
<i> It keeps the industry alive
alone! </ i></i>

01:04:29.904 --> 01:04:34.404
<i> I crossed
few lines of this letter ... </ i></i>

01:04:36.403 --> 01:04:39.203
It's weird <i>
to continue to write, right? </ i></i>

01:04:39.803 --> 01:04:43.203
<i> can write everything in a letter,
it's easy. </ i></i>

01:04:44.203 --> 01:04:47.902
<i> But what I erased,
I must tell you in the face. </ i></i>

01:04:49.202 --> 01:04:51.802
<i> It is time we meet. </ i></i>

01:04:53.102 --> 01:04:57.001
<i> Do you know the coffee Kooler
in Matunga? </ i></i>

01:04:57.901 --> 01:05:00.401
It seems they are <i>
a very good "kheema pao", </ i></i>

01:05:01.201 --> 01:05:02.301
<i> my favorite dish. </ i></i>

01:05:02.601 --> 01:05:05.400
<i> What say you of an appointment
tomorrow at 13 am? </ i></i>

01:06:01.195 --> 01:06:02.395
Mr. Saajan ...

01:06:03.294 --> 01:06:04.094
What?

01:06:04.294 --> 01:06:05.894
The boss wants to see you.

01:06:06.694 --> 01:06:09.794
-- Yes, I will go after lunch.
-- This is urgent.

01:06:11.394 --> 01:06:12.493
I'm coming.

01:06:28.692 --> 01:06:29.592
Can I enter?

01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:50.290
I just had a meeting
with accounting.

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:53.689
I've never been
so embarrassed in my life.

01:06:55.089 --> 01:06:56.889
Do you know what they said?

01:06:57.989 --> 01:07:02.388
It is as if our service
claims did not exist.

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:07.088
All payment orders are wrong!

01:07:07.288 --> 01:07:10.187
Shaikh initials are everywhere.

01:07:11.487 --> 01:07:14.287
The idea that I would leave
replace you!

01:07:18.087 --> 01:07:20.186
Should you review all of this.

01:07:21.186 --> 01:07:23.486
Spend the night if necessary,
but correct me that.

01:07:24.586 --> 01:07:27.286
In your case, Shaikh,
out of my sight.

01:07:27.486 --> 01:07:29.185
It's my fault, sir.

01:07:30.285 --> 01:07:32.685
It is I who
payment orders.

01:07:33.285 --> 01:07:35.985
He has initialed
because we work together.

01:07:36.785 --> 01:07:38.285
It's my fault.

01:07:38.584 --> 01:07:40.884
Fernandes,
you do not have to defend it.

01:07:41.184 --> 01:07:42.884
I am not defending anyone, sir.

01:07:45.784 --> 01:07:47.684
35 years of service,

01:07:48.083 --> 01:07:50.383
and you have never done
the slightest mistake.

01:07:51.483 --> 01:07:54.183
It's not my type
defend anyone.

01:07:56.783 --> 01:07:58.182
Anyway,

01:07:59.782 --> 01:08:02.082
I take care of the accounting.

01:08:02.682 --> 01:08:04.182
Okay, sir.

01:08:08.381 --> 01:08:09.881
One last thing.

01:08:10.981 --> 01:08:13.281
Why these files
they have the smell of vegetables?

01:08:15.281 --> 01:08:17.880
Onions, potatoes, even garlic!

01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:18.979
Really?

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.080
Feel!

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:24.880
I do not know.

01:08:46.877 --> 01:08:48.676
Pardon, sir.

01:08:52.977 --> 01:08:53.877
Thank you.
You saved me.

01:08:54.176 --> 01:08:57.676
Do not cut ever
those pesky vegetables on folders.

01:08:58.975 --> 01:09:00.076
Forgiveness.

01:09:03.276 --> 01:09:06.675
I put a plastic bag,
next time.

01:09:10.075 --> 01:09:14.075
Okay, no vegetables. Nothing. Forgiveness.

01:09:16.874 --> 01:09:19.073
This is not the accounts
a shabby little restaurant!

01:09:19.374 --> 01:09:21.374
These public accounts!

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:29.573
If you do not do that, go!

01:09:30.473 --> 01:09:31.673
From?

01:09:31.973 --> 01:09:32.973
No.

01:09:34.272 --> 01:09:35.872
You teach me everything.

01:09:36.971 --> 01:09:39.471
I'm sorry,
but you teach me everything.

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:46.571
Your mother told you
to make fake degrees

01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:48.371
to get a job?

01:09:51.071 --> 01:09:53.470
It must have been mistaken ...

01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:58.570
What kind of person are you?

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:08.869
And if you come home for lunch?

01:10:09.569 --> 01:10:11.369
I prepared a "Pasanda".

01:10:19.468 --> 01:10:21.867
Amazing! Mr. Shaikh.

01:10:23.867 --> 01:10:25.367
Amazing ...

01:10:29.867 --> 01:10:31.266
A "Pasanda" he said.

01:10:35.566 --> 01:10:37.366
You come from, is not it?

01:10:39.766 --> 01:10:41.565
-- Take--in.
-- No.

01:10:43.365 --> 01:10:44.465
This is very good.

01:10:44.665 --> 01:10:46.265
This is my recipe.

01:10:46.465 --> 01:10:47.765
My father warned me:

01:10:47.965 --> 01:10:50.564
"Do not marry this guy,
it will chain you to the stove. "

01:10:50.764 --> 01:10:52.964
His father is a very dangerous man.

01:10:53.164 --> 01:10:57.964
He did not smile
since the World Cup 1984.

01:10:58.164 --> 01:11:00.663
Or maybe just a little.

01:11:02.863 --> 01:11:04.863
Still grinning.

01:11:09.562 --> 01:11:11.462
What does your wife?

01:11:11.662 --> 01:11:13.062
Shh.

01:11:13.662 --> 01:11:15.362
I'm sorry, she did not know.

01:11:15.562 --> 01:11:17.062
Okay.

01:11:18.162 --> 01:11:21.861
My wife is dead.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.860
But I have a girlfriend.

01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:36.260
You?

01:11:38.559 --> 01:11:39.759
Yes.

01:11:46.659 --> 01:11:48.458
How is it called?

01:12:00.457 --> 01:12:01.657
Ila.

01:12:04.957 --> 01:12:09.456
I knew it!
Meals, notes ...

01:12:09.956 --> 01:12:11.556
When were you married?

01:12:11.756 --> 01:12:16.256
Marriage ... it sometimes seems
it's been 35 years.

01:12:17.055 --> 01:12:21.055
Or 25 or 10, but I sometimes
feel like it was yesterday.

01:12:24.055 --> 01:12:26.654
You back for seconds.

01:12:28.554 --> 01:12:30.154
This is my recipe.

01:12:31.754 --> 01:12:33.154
You do not eat anything at all.

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:40.253
I wanted to ask you something.

01:12:40.553 --> 01:12:42.053
Go ahead.

01:12:44.353 --> 01:12:47.452
About our marriage ...

01:12:50.752 --> 01:12:53.752
In fact, his father refused.

01:12:54.852 --> 01:12:58.751
He said: "He is an orphan, small,
he skinned. "

01:13:02.551 --> 01:13:07.050
Meherunissa then fled.

01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:15.049
But she wants the blessing
his father.

01:13:17.249 --> 01:13:18.749
I will not tell anyone.

01:13:18.949 --> 01:13:20.649
No, that's not it.

01:13:20.949 --> 01:13:23.049
He agreed.

01:13:24.548 --> 01:13:26.048
We're getting married.

01:13:31.748 --> 01:13:37.647
There will be a whole army on his side:
brothers and sisters, uncles and aunts ...

01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:42.047
everyone will be there.

01:13:42.747 --> 01:13:45.646
But there will be no one on my side.

01:13:47.746 --> 01:13:49.446
I am alone.

01:13:50.446 --> 01:13:52.745
I wanted to know if you would ...

01:13:54.945 --> 01:13:58.945
to be my witness.

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:01.445
Me?

01:14:02.144 --> 01:14:04.544
Yes. And if Ms. Ila could come too.

01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:10.344
Course.

01:14:13.943 --> 01:14:15.043
We will come.

01:14:18.643 --> 01:14:20.743
His father wants to offer me a scooter.

01:14:21.242 --> 01:14:23.042
A gift for my promotion.

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:25.642
But I'm not leaving.

01:14:28.142 --> 01:14:31.441
I thought refuse
early departure retirement.

01:14:33.541 --> 01:14:37.241
I ask the boss
you become my assistant.

01:14:37.841 --> 01:14:39.041
So your promotion ...

01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:46.640
This is very good news,
Sir!

01:14:50.139 --> 01:14:53.239
But not a word to my father,
otherwise no scooter.

01:14:55.839 --> 01:14:58.739
I'll tell Meherunissa.

01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:31.229
Sir, you want to sit?

01:16:31.429 --> 01:16:32.429
Me?

01:16:33.029 --> 01:16:34.629
Yes, take my place.

01:16:34.829 --> 01:16:35.828
No.

01:16:36.728 --> 01:16:39.028
Please.
I go down to the next.

01:17:06.125 --> 01:17:07.725
-- Fernandes.
-- Yes?

01:17:07.925 --> 01:17:09.425
You wanted to talk to me?

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:11.425
No.

01:17:12.025 --> 01:17:14.124
My secretary told me ...

01:17:14.924 --> 01:17:17.024
It was about payment orders.

01:17:17.924 --> 01:17:19.324
What is it?

01:17:20.224 --> 01:17:21.524
This is resolved.

01:17:21.924 --> 01:17:23.523
-- Are you sure?
-- Yes.

01:17:25.523 --> 01:17:27.823
Okay. See you later.

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:56.720
Want to Buy?

01:19:43.309 --> 01:19:44.409
<i> Dear Ila, </ i></i>

01:19:44.909 --> 01:19:47.608
<i> I got the lunchbox today
but it was empty. </ i></i>

01:19:47.908 --> 01:19:50.208
<i> It was deserved. </ i></i>

01:19:51.808 --> 01:19:55.508
<i> Yesterday you me long
waited at the restaurant ... </ i></i>

01:19:56.108 --> 01:19:58.807
<i> But before that, in the morning, </ i></i>

01:19:59.007 --> 01:20:02.207
<i> I forgot something
in the bathroom. </ i></i>

01:20:03.407 --> 01:20:05.007
<i> I went back ... </ i></i>

01:20:06.407 --> 01:20:08.206
<i> and the room had the same smell </ i></i>

01:20:08.406 --> 01:20:10.406
<i> that my grandfather left there </ i></i>

01:20:10.706 --> 01:20:12.306
<i> after his shower. </ i></i>

01:20:15.106 --> 01:20:17.205
<i> It was like he had been there. </ i></i>

01:20:18.305 --> 01:20:19.805
<i> But that was not the case. </ i></i>

01:20:20.105 --> 01:20:21.505
<i> That was me. </ i></i>

01:20:22.505 --> 01:20:25.205
<i> Me and the smell of an old man. </ i></i>

01:20:27.004 --> 01:20:29.304
<i> I do not know
when I became old. </ i></i>

01:20:29.504 --> 01:20:34.304
<i> It was perhaps this morning.
Or before. </ I></i>

01:20:35.503 --> 01:20:38.203
<i> And maybe if I'd forgotten
something earlier, </ i></i>

01:20:38.503 --> 01:20:40.303
<i> I would then noticed. </ i></i>

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:43.203
Sir, you want to sit?

01:20:43.903 --> 01:20:44.803
No.

01:20:47.902 --> 01:20:51.002
<i> life rocked me languidly, </ i></i>

01:20:52.102 --> 01:20:55.101
<i> forward, back ... </ i></i>

01:20:56.001 --> 01:20:58.001
<i> And before I knew it ... </ i></i>

01:20:59.301 --> 01:21:02.401
<i> Nobody buys
a lottery ticket expired, Ila. </ i></i>

01:21:03.601 --> 01:21:06.100
<i> I came to the restaurant. </ i></i>

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:09.700
<i> And you were there, </ i></i>

01:21:09.900 --> 01:21:11.700
<i> fiddling with your purse, </ i></i>

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.099
<i> to drink all that water ... </ i></i>

01:21:22.399 --> 01:21:24.798
I wanted to come <i>
tell you all this in the face, </ i></i>

01:21:24.998 --> 01:21:27.098
<i> but I only look at you. </ i></i>

01:21:31.598 --> 01:21:33.197
<i> You were lovely. </ i></i>

01:21:37.697 --> 01:21:38.997
<i> You are young. </ i></i>

01:21:39.697 --> 01:21:41.397
<i> You still have dreams. </ i></i>

01:21:43.396 --> 01:21:45.196
<i> You have greeted me some time. </ i></i>

01:21:48.896 --> 01:21:51.096
<i> And I want to thank you. </ i></i>

01:22:30.791 --> 01:22:34.391
The two ladies behind
come forward, please.

01:22:37.691 --> 01:22:39.091
Smile, please.

01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:41.490
One, two, three.

01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:43.890
Now a photo
with everyone!

01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:47.090
The family of the bride to the right.
The spouse left.

01:22:54.889 --> 01:22:57.589
The spouse left.

01:23:15.687 --> 01:23:17.087
You leave, sir?

01:23:18.786 --> 01:23:21.986
-- This is the new scooter?
-- I will drop you somewhere?

01:23:23.586 --> 01:23:27.086
If you stay,
I will go to my father.

01:23:29.885 --> 01:23:30.985
Taxi!

01:23:32.985 --> 01:23:36.885
It's weird, it is very dry ...

01:23:48.683 --> 01:23:49.983
Goodbye, Shaikh.

01:23:55.483 --> 01:23:56.882
You know,

01:23:57.482 --> 01:24:00.882
when I took the train for the 1st time
with you, 1st class.

01:24:01.782 --> 01:24:03.482
That day, I had no ticket.

01:24:05.082 --> 01:24:07.681
I was anxious throughout the journey.

01:24:08.281 --> 01:24:10.181
I prayed that the controller
does not come.

01:24:10.381 --> 01:24:12.081
What would you think of me?

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:19.980
The next day, I got to
a 1st class pass.

01:24:34.379 --> 01:24:36.378
You make a good husband, Shaikh.

01:24:38.178 --> 01:24:39.378
Thank you.

01:24:47.877 --> 01:24:49.077
A moment.

01:24:56.576 --> 01:24:58.576
Come see me at Nasik, on occasion.

01:25:46.871 --> 01:25:50.171
I'm coming, Mom.

01:26:06.669 --> 01:26:08.069
80 rupees.

01:26:36.066 --> 01:26:37.766
Rajeev comes.

01:26:38.866 --> 01:26:40.565
It is in a meeting.

01:26:41.065 --> 01:26:43.265
It will go directly to the crematorium.

01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:52.964
I have one of these hungers.

01:26:54.864 --> 01:26:57.064
A desire to "parathas".

01:27:01.263 --> 01:27:03.763
I have not eaten this morning.

01:27:04.863 --> 01:27:07.163
I prepared his breakfast it.

01:27:07.363 --> 01:27:08.463
Mom ...

01:27:13.462 --> 01:27:15.962
I always apprehended

01:27:17.662 --> 01:27:20.561
what would happen to me after his death.

01:27:23.061 --> 01:27:24.561
-- Do not worry.
-- But now ...

01:27:26.861 --> 01:27:29.160
I'm hungry, that's all.

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.859
It was loved at first

01:27:42.159 --> 01:27:43.859
when you were born.

01:27:47.758 --> 01:27:52.658
But for years,
it disgusted me.

01:27:55.658 --> 01:27:59.057
Every morning, I prepared something to eat.

01:27:59.257 --> 01:28:01.557
Drugs. Bath.

01:28:01.957 --> 01:28:04.057
Breakfast. Drugs.

01:28:04.257 --> 01:28:05.557
Bath.

01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:17.855
When your brother is dead,

01:28:20.455 --> 01:28:23.055
this old ambulance came.

01:28:23.555 --> 01:28:24.955
Do you remember?

01:28:28.254 --> 01:28:30.554
These old Matador models.

01:28:31.554 --> 01:28:33.654
Which came today?

01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:37.653
What color?

01:28:39.053 --> 01:28:42.253
White with blue light.

01:28:43.253 --> 01:28:44.053
Yes.

01:29:03.651 --> 01:29:04.750
Sir.

01:29:06.850 --> 01:29:09.650
The lunchbox comes
to the wrong address.

01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:11.650
It is impossible.

01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:16.649
-- We never make mistakes.
-- Yes, I understand.

01:29:16.849 --> 01:29:22.249
But my meals are poorly delivered.

01:29:22.449 --> 01:29:24.348
-- It is delivered to the right address.
-- I tell you no.

01:29:24.548 --> 01:29:26.148
People came to Harvard.

01:29:26.348 --> 01:29:27.548
Listen to what I tell you.

01:29:28.348 --> 01:29:30.548
Try to understand.

01:29:31.448 --> 01:29:34.847
This lunchbox is not delivered to my husband.

01:29:35.047 --> 01:29:38.547
It comes also
it is someone else who receives it.

01:29:39.047 --> 01:29:42.346
People Harvard
came to study our system.

01:29:42.546 --> 01:29:44.846
They say that there is no error.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.546
But it's not going to the right place.

01:29:46.846 --> 01:29:48.346
You think I'm a liar?

01:29:48.646 --> 01:29:52.145
The King of England in person
came to observe our system.

01:29:52.445 --> 01:29:55.145
But this meal goes somewhere
someone eats it.

01:29:55.345 --> 01:29:56.645
He goes to the right place.

01:29:56.845 --> 01:29:59.645
I want the address!

01:30:24.542 --> 01:30:25.842
Office Saajan Fernandes?

01:30:26.042 --> 01:30:28.842
Two rows away.

01:30:39.341 --> 01:30:42.340
Is the office Saajan Fernandes?

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.140
I remember you.

01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:47.040
Saajan Fernandes?

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:48.740
He is gone.

01:30:49.439 --> 01:30:52.239
He left the company.

01:30:52.939 --> 01:30:54.239
Where can I find it?

01:30:56.939 --> 01:30:58.339
He went to Nasik.

01:31:07.338 --> 01:31:09.337
Then you go to Nasik?

01:31:09.637 --> 01:31:10.537
Yes.

01:31:12.537 --> 01:31:14.437
You move?

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:17.537
Yes.

01:31:18.236 --> 01:31:19.836
This is final?

01:31:21.536 --> 01:31:22.536
Yes.

01:31:26.536 --> 01:31:29.335
I'm retired there for years.

01:31:29.535 --> 01:31:32.235
I return to Mumbai from time to time
to see my son.

01:32:11.331 --> 01:32:12.431
I'm sorry, Mrs. Ila.

01:32:57.426 --> 01:32:58.726
Good evening, Mr. Fernandes.

01:32:58.926 --> 01:33:00.326
We thought you were gone.

01:33:00.626 --> 01:33:03.026
Yes, but I came back.

01:33:03.226 --> 01:33:04.225
Why?

01:33:12.725 --> 01:33:15.524
Well, you can play here.

01:33:15.824 --> 01:33:18.524
But do not break windows,
understood?

01:33:19.424 --> 01:33:20.324
Hold.

01:33:22.424 --> 01:33:23.323
Thank you, Mr. Fernandes.

01:33:49.221 --> 01:33:51.520
I've been calling you all the time.

01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:54.020
Where were you?

01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:56.220
I had to adjust something.

01:33:56.820 --> 01:33:58.520
I got worried.

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:03.719
I have more layers to Tonton.

01:34:04.419 --> 01:34:06.419
I asked the guard to search.

01:34:08.819 --> 01:34:11.218
I washed the fan today.

01:34:12.418 --> 01:34:14.518
While he was running!

01:36:02.407 --> 01:36:04.307
<i> You're probably Nasik. </ i></i>

01:36:05.207 --> 01:36:07.806
<i> You had to get up this morning
make a tea. </ i></i>

01:36:10.006 --> 01:36:12.106
<i> And maybe a walk then. </ i></i>

01:36:14.406 --> 01:36:18.305
<i> This morning I woke up,
and I sold all my jewelry. </ i></i>

01:36:19.205 --> 01:36:22.805
<i> My bracelets, my earrings,
my wedding necklace. </ i></i>

01:36:23.205 --> 01:36:24.805
<i> It is not much. </ i></i>

01:36:25.004 --> 01:36:29.104
<i> But they told me:
1 rupee is worth 5 in Bhutan. </ I></i>

01:36:29.604 --> 01:36:31.804
So we should <i>
get away for some time. </ i></i>

01:36:32.004 --> 01:36:33.404
<i> And more ... </ i></i>

01:36:35.003 --> 01:36:37.303
<i> we'll see. </ i></i>

01:36:38.703 --> 01:36:41.903
<i> return Yashvi,
luggage will be ready. </ i></i>

01:36:42.103 --> 01:36:44.202
<i> We take the train this afternoon. </ i></i>

01:36:45.202 --> 01:36:47.602
<i> I may send you this letter </ i></i>

01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:50.302
<i> and your new factor
you bring. </ i></i>

01:36:51.002 --> 01:36:53.502
<i> Or maybe I should keep it, </ i></i>

01:36:54.401 --> 01:36:56.801
<i> and read in a few years ... </ i></i>

01:36:58.401 --> 01:37:00.001
<i> I read somewhere that sometimes, </ i></i>

01:37:01.301 --> 01:37:04.200
<i> the wrong train
can lead you to the right station. </ i></i>

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.100
<i> We'll see ... </ i></i>
