WEBVTT

00:02.425 --> 00:04.242
Howard's capsule
should be reentering

00:04.244 --> 00:05.994
the atmosphere
any minute.

00:05.996 --> 00:07.429
It'll be good to have him back.

00:07.431 --> 00:10.132
The Fantastic Four reunited!

00:10.134 --> 00:14.336
Yeah, you had a good
run, Fake Wolowitz.

00:14.338 --> 00:17.773
We'll remember you
with nostalgic fondness.

00:17.775 --> 00:22.427
The way we do the dial-up modem,
the VHS tape, or...

00:22.429 --> 00:24.479
or Leonard's gym membership.

00:25.948 --> 00:27.199
We're not kicking him out.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.984
Stuart and I have
become good friends.

00:28.986 --> 00:31.153
Okay, one vote for,
one vote against.

00:31.155 --> 00:33.271
Leonard, you're
the tiebreaker.

00:33.273 --> 00:34.990
I don't have a problem
with Stuart.

00:34.992 --> 00:36.958
Besides, he gives us
a 20% discount

00:36.960 --> 00:38.210
at his comic book store.

00:38.212 --> 00:40.445
Well, I don't sell my
friendship that cheaply.

00:40.447 --> 00:41.747
I can go 30.

00:41.749 --> 00:43.582
Welcome aboard,
old chum.

00:44.884 --> 00:46.951
Okay, the NASA Web site says

00:46.953 --> 00:49.454
Howard's final
descent has begun.

00:49.456 --> 00:52.174
He left a boy,

00:52.176 --> 00:56.061
he returns a boy-sized hero.

02:06.651 --> 02:09.318
Waiting for my husband.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.820
That's nice.

02:10.822 --> 02:13.439
He's coming back
from outer space.

02:13.441 --> 02:17.326
I think this flight's
coming from Houston.

02:18.912 --> 02:20.496
No, I mean, he...

02:20.498 --> 02:21.997
Never mind.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.334
There he is! Howie!

02:29.923 --> 02:30.989
Howie!

02:30.991 --> 02:32.475
Whoa, thank you.

02:32.477 --> 02:34.627
Great to be
back on Earth.

02:34.629 --> 02:38.347
Uh, I think they're
here for me, Ringo.

02:38.349 --> 02:41.183
Howie!
Howie!

02:41.185 --> 02:42.551
Mr. Mandel, I'm your driver.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.303
Oh, thanks.

02:44.305 --> 02:45.438
Here you go.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.107
That nut job was telling
everybody on the plane

02:48.109 --> 02:50.059
he's an astronaut.

02:50.061 --> 02:52.228
I missed you so much!

02:53.647 --> 02:56.148
I missed you, too.

02:57.851 --> 02:59.652
Oh...

02:59.654 --> 03:00.903
Where are the guys?

03:00.905 --> 03:02.187
Oh, it's just me.

03:02.189 --> 03:03.522
Oh, I get it.

03:03.524 --> 03:06.358
They're waiting back home
with a big surprise party.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.160
Don't worry, I can
act surprised.

03:10.864 --> 03:14.216
No, I told them they could
have you tomorrow night.

03:14.218 --> 03:16.418
Tonight, you belong to me.

03:22.009 --> 03:24.059
Gesundheit.
You okay?

03:24.061 --> 03:26.211
I am now that you're back.

03:26.213 --> 03:27.580
Come on, let's go home

03:27.582 --> 03:29.732
so I can tear off
those little pants.

03:29.734 --> 03:30.988
Great. Just keep in mind

03:31.013 --> 03:33.698
astronauts lose a lot of
muscle tone in space,

03:33.798 --> 03:37.383
so you might have to do
most of the heavy lifting.

03:38.742 --> 03:40.493
You know, I am
very disappointed

03:40.495 --> 03:42.444
that I won't be able
to celebrate

03:42.446 --> 03:44.330
Howard's accomplishment tonight.

03:44.332 --> 03:46.081
Me, too.
But we'll see him tomorrow.

03:46.083 --> 03:48.834
Yes, it's just that
in all the years I've known him,

03:48.836 --> 03:53.088
he's never had the opportunity
to receive my admiration.

03:54.107 --> 03:56.091
I was excited to see
the look on his face

03:56.093 --> 03:57.459
when it finally happened.

03:57.461 --> 03:59.645
You're unbelievable.

03:59.647 --> 04:01.463
I know.

04:01.465 --> 04:02.915
All right,

04:02.917 --> 04:04.450
Pictionary-- what are the teams?

04:04.452 --> 04:05.885
How about
boys versus girls?

04:05.887 --> 04:06.919
Oh!

04:06.921 --> 04:08.103
That hardly seems fair.

04:08.105 --> 04:10.773
But I guess
any team that I'm not on

04:10.775 --> 04:12.558
has a decided disadvantage.

04:14.144 --> 04:15.895
Once again, unbelievable.
Yeah,

04:15.897 --> 04:18.363
once again, I know.

04:18.366 --> 04:21.367
All right, round one.

04:21.369 --> 04:22.334
Here.

04:22.336 --> 04:24.370
Got it.
Okay.

04:24.372 --> 04:26.088
Ready, set,

04:26.090 --> 04:27.790
go.

04:29.209 --> 04:30.209
Uh, box?

04:30.211 --> 04:31.710
Uh,

04:31.712 --> 04:33.111
window?

04:34.113 --> 04:35.414
Batman.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.218
Batman and Robin.

04:41.454 --> 04:43.422
Uh, Wonder Twins
plus the monkey.

04:45.141 --> 04:47.459
Wonder Twins plus
the monkey <i>and</i> Batman.

04:49.246 --> 04:50.462
A gift? Present!

04:50.464 --> 04:51.647
Present! Yeah!

04:51.649 --> 04:54.250
Oh...
Leonard.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.936
Now, how can you not get that?

04:56.938 --> 05:00.990
In what universe
is that a present?

05:00.992 --> 05:02.458
It's not <i>a</i> present,

05:02.460 --> 05:04.577
it's <i>the</i> present. Look.

05:04.579 --> 05:06.278
There's you and me.

05:06.280 --> 05:07.813
It's Penny and Amy.

05:07.815 --> 05:10.249
We're playing Pictionary.

05:10.251 --> 05:12.551
In the present.

05:16.806 --> 05:19.592
Oh, my God, we're
gonna kill them.

05:21.728 --> 05:24.096
It's a quark-gluon plasma.

05:24.981 --> 05:25.948
No.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.883
It's asymptotically free partons

05:27.885 --> 05:30.502
inside a quark-gluon plasma.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.972
Nothing with quarks.

05:32.974 --> 05:34.773
It's an observational rebuttal

05:34.775 --> 05:37.476
of the Lambda-CDM model
of the universe!

05:38.645 --> 05:39.628
No!

05:39.630 --> 05:40.729
It's a chocolate chip cookie!

05:40.731 --> 05:42.982
Yes!

05:44.668 --> 05:46.852
How could you miss that?

05:46.854 --> 05:50.122
Hey, if you want someone to
guess "chocolate chip cookie,"

05:50.124 --> 05:52.608
you draw a glass of milk
next to it.

05:52.610 --> 05:55.193
Penny got it.
Yeah, only after

05:55.195 --> 05:57.746
I eliminated
all the <i>obvious</i> answers.

05:58.698 --> 06:00.015
You're welcome.

06:02.702 --> 06:05.454
Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage.

06:05.456 --> 06:07.423
Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst?

06:08.207 --> 06:10.142
Oh, oh, a hot dog.

06:11.044 --> 06:12.761
Penny, aren't you gonna
draw something?

06:12.763 --> 06:17.132
Relax, we got time,
this is so fun.

06:18.301 --> 06:20.052
There.

06:20.054 --> 06:21.403
A solar system.

06:21.405 --> 06:22.721
Uh, uh, uh,

06:22.723 --> 06:26.692
uh, um, unidentified
flying liverwurst? I don't...

06:27.727 --> 06:30.029
Now?

06:30.031 --> 06:31.897
Soon.

06:31.899 --> 06:33.699
Come on, Leonard,

06:33.701 --> 06:36.368
I am spoon-feeding this to you.

06:42.876 --> 06:44.243
I don't know,

06:44.245 --> 06:45.477
uh...

06:45.479 --> 06:48.180
Casper the <i>alcoholic</i> ghost?

06:49.416 --> 06:51.517
All right,
that's enough.

06:54.354 --> 06:55.949
Uh, hand.

06:55.950 --> 06:57.333
Uh, nail...
polish?

06:57.358 --> 06:58.842
Yep!

06:58.843 --> 07:01.093
Wait, no, no!

07:01.095 --> 07:02.978
No!

07:02.980 --> 07:05.263
The word is "Polish."

07:05.265 --> 07:07.432
See, look.
Polish sausage.

07:07.434 --> 07:10.069
And the-the model
of the solar system developed

07:10.071 --> 07:12.621
by Nicolaus Copernicus,
a <i>Polish</i> astronomer.

07:12.623 --> 07:14.206
And then, finally,

07:14.208 --> 07:15.741
if that wasn't enough--
which it should've been--

07:15.743 --> 07:18.160
this is Madame Curie
killing herself

07:18.162 --> 07:20.245
by discovering radium, who,

07:20.247 --> 07:22.280
although she was
a naturalized French citizen,

07:22.282 --> 07:25.217
was <i>Polish</i> by birth!

07:27.987 --> 07:30.639
Excuse me,
the word is "polish."

07:30.641 --> 07:32.591
See? Small "P."

07:34.427 --> 07:36.228
Ah!

07:37.680 --> 07:39.648
So it is.

07:39.650 --> 07:41.734
I guess we both
share blame on this one.

07:44.604 --> 07:47.072
Bernie, you okay?

07:47.074 --> 07:48.607
Yeah, I'll be
right there.

07:54.697 --> 07:59.651
Did you get a sea lion
while I was gone?

07:59.653 --> 08:02.154
It's just allergies.

08:02.156 --> 08:04.289
Okay.

08:04.291 --> 08:06.175
Took some Benadryl.
I'll be fine.

08:07.878 --> 08:08.927
So...

08:08.929 --> 08:10.179
did you miss me?

08:10.181 --> 08:12.147
Oh.

08:12.149 --> 08:14.166
Are you kidding?
Every minute of every...

08:17.937 --> 08:20.338
Ew.

08:25.011 --> 08:26.945
Excuse me.

08:26.947 --> 08:29.648
Sweetie, we don't have
to do this now.

08:29.650 --> 08:32.284
Yes, we do.

08:36.072 --> 08:39.524
You left right after
we got married.

08:40.461 --> 08:43.861
This is like
our honeymoon.

08:46.365 --> 08:47.532
Now,

08:47.534 --> 08:49.751
hold on to your hat.

08:49.753 --> 08:52.254
Oh.

08:52.256 --> 08:53.672
Uh-oh.

08:53.674 --> 08:54.840
You okay?

08:54.842 --> 08:56.258
A little dizzy.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.876
Must be the Benadryl.

08:57.878 --> 09:00.813
Switch places with me.

09:00.815 --> 09:02.981
Okay.

09:05.269 --> 09:06.985
Now...

09:10.273 --> 09:13.158
...kiss me!

09:15.000 --> 09:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:22.852 --> 09:24.569
Bernadette?

09:27.625 --> 09:29.908
Bernie?
Bernie?

09:31.378 --> 09:33.679
That was amazing.

09:36.950 --> 09:40.435
You made me feel things
I never...

09:45.758 --> 09:49.444
Well, that was quick
and a little gross.

09:49.446 --> 09:53.765
Now, I know how <i>she</i> feels.

09:54.934 --> 09:57.569
Hey, Sheldon, you're always

09:57.571 --> 09:59.437
full of fun little facts.

09:59.439 --> 10:00.539
Where did the expression

10:00.541 --> 10:03.859
"got your ass handed to you"
come from?

10:06.496 --> 10:08.864
Don't know.

10:08.866 --> 10:12.301
I wonder if it's from,
like, ancient Rome

10:12.303 --> 10:13.785
where they'd actually
chop somebody's ass off

10:13.787 --> 10:16.788
and then go, "Here."

10:18.007 --> 10:22.010
You know, to appease
Loseroneous, the god of losers.

10:23.162 --> 10:24.546
I am not a loser.

10:24.548 --> 10:28.466
Pictionary is not a true test of
any real intelligence or skill.

10:28.468 --> 10:30.185
Mmm, in all
fairness,

10:30.187 --> 10:33.322
Pictionary has verbal
skills, visual skills.

10:33.324 --> 10:34.773
It's a pretty well-rounded game.

10:34.775 --> 10:36.191
Lot of big talk
from a man

10:36.193 --> 10:37.859
who can't draw
a chocolate chip cookie.

10:39.078 --> 10:40.462
All right, fine,
pick another game.

10:40.464 --> 10:42.447
Amy and I will beat
you at anything.

10:42.449 --> 10:43.916
All right.

10:43.918 --> 10:45.650
Let's play...

10:45.652 --> 10:48.570
Physics Fiesta.

10:48.572 --> 10:50.756
Oh, come on, what is that?

10:50.758 --> 10:52.457
It's a game
that I just invented,

10:52.459 --> 10:55.093
in which the participants
answer physics questions

10:55.095 --> 10:56.929
in remedial Spanish.

10:56.931 --> 10:58.496
Um...

10:58.498 --> 11:01.433
¿Dónde está el boson de Higgs?

11:02.385 --> 11:04.486
En el acelerador
<i>de particulares.</i>

11:06.306 --> 11:08.523
<i>Bueno, mi amigo.</i>

11:10.860 --> 11:14.062
No, no, we're not playing
some dumb made-up game.

11:14.064 --> 11:16.014
All games
are made up.

11:16.016 --> 11:17.616
They're not found in nature.

11:17.618 --> 11:19.618
You don't just dig in
the ground, come across

11:19.620 --> 11:22.654
a rich vein
of Rock'em Sock'em Robots.

11:23.522 --> 11:24.906
Just pick
another game.

11:24.908 --> 11:26.325
Why don't we do
something athletic

11:26.327 --> 11:29.161
like go over to the university
pool and play water polo?

11:29.163 --> 11:32.264
No good--
Sheldon doesn't float.

11:32.266 --> 11:33.749
That is true.

11:33.751 --> 11:36.134
I have a higher than
normal body density.

11:36.136 --> 11:39.254
If I run too deep a bath,
I drown.

11:39.256 --> 11:41.039
All right,
let's keep it simple.

11:41.041 --> 11:42.007
How about darts?

11:42.009 --> 11:43.642
Oh, that's not fair either.

11:43.644 --> 11:44.676
Why not?

11:44.678 --> 11:46.228
Darts is a bar game.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.263
You've been frequenting
drinking establishments

11:48.265 --> 11:50.449
since you were of legal age.

11:50.451 --> 11:53.769
Yeah, that's
when it started.

11:53.771 --> 11:56.071
Well, regardless, she
has a distinct advantage

11:56.073 --> 11:57.555
in all tavern-
based competitions.

11:57.557 --> 12:02.160
Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt
contests-- they're all out.

12:02.162 --> 12:03.528
Okay.

12:03.530 --> 12:05.831
Just for the record,
I have never entered

12:05.833 --> 12:07.399
a wet T-shirt contest.

12:07.401 --> 12:10.002
I've won a few, but that's just
because I spill when I'm drunk,

12:10.004 --> 12:12.504
so...

12:12.506 --> 12:14.456
We could go
to the cadaver lab at UCLA

12:14.458 --> 12:18.293
and play real-life Operation.

12:18.295 --> 12:21.179
Uh-uh.  No.
I don't think so.

12:21.181 --> 12:23.048
Are you sure? I mean,
the nose doesn't light up,

12:23.050 --> 12:24.282
but if the corpse
is fresh enough,

12:24.284 --> 12:27.719
sometimes you can get
the leg to jerk.

12:29.772 --> 12:34.643
Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle,
your little star is home!

12:36.145 --> 12:38.814
Ma, the chain's on the door!

12:38.816 --> 12:40.198
Howard?

12:40.200 --> 12:43.668
I thought I wasn't going
to see you till tomorrow!

12:43.670 --> 12:46.154
Yeah, well,
Bernie's not feeling well,

12:46.156 --> 12:47.823
so I thought I'd stop by,

12:47.825 --> 12:50.792
tell you about the greatest
adventure of my life,

12:50.794 --> 12:54.212
see if you can make me feel bad
about it.

12:54.214 --> 12:58.900
Uh, uh, okay, hold
on, I'm not decent!

12:58.902 --> 13:00.802
All right.

13:00.804 --> 13:02.721
Woman hasn't tied her robe
in 20 years.

13:02.723 --> 13:04.122
Suddenly she's not decent?

13:04.124 --> 13:08.727
You want me to hide in the
closet or go out the back?!

13:09.729 --> 13:12.714
Shh, you need to whisper.

13:12.716 --> 13:14.466
Ma, who is in there?

13:14.468 --> 13:15.634
Uh, nobody!

13:15.636 --> 13:17.853
The TV is on!

13:17.855 --> 13:19.071
I only got one sock.

13:19.073 --> 13:21.873
Where's my
other sock?

13:21.875 --> 13:22.974
Who is that?

13:22.976 --> 13:24.409
I told you, it's the TV.

13:24.411 --> 13:28.947
Jay Leno lost a sock;
it's hilarious.

13:28.949 --> 13:31.649
If you're busy, I can come back.

13:31.651 --> 13:33.201
Just give me
a second!

13:33.203 --> 13:35.420
Go, go, go, go.

13:44.797 --> 13:46.381
Dr. Schneider?

13:46.383 --> 13:49.184
Oh, hello, Howard.

13:50.019 --> 13:52.204
What are you doing here?

13:52.206 --> 13:55.474
Um, house call.

13:55.476 --> 13:57.642
You're a dentist.

13:58.945 --> 14:01.196
Yes, yes, I am.

14:01.198 --> 14:03.782
I think he's
on to us!

14:11.924 --> 14:13.624
Okay, glasses off.

14:13.626 --> 14:15.910
Find Waldo.

14:21.450 --> 14:23.201
Hurry up,
find him, find him.

14:23.203 --> 14:25.036
I'm trying!
Don't yell at me!

14:25.038 --> 14:26.170
For goodness' sake,
he's wearing

14:26.172 --> 14:28.873
a hat, glasses,
and a red striped shirt.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.074
I know what he looks like.

14:30.076 --> 14:31.476
Oh, there he
is, I got him.

14:31.478 --> 14:34.295
Yes, we
win again!

14:34.297 --> 14:36.130
How could you not find him?

14:36.132 --> 14:38.566
Because he's hard to find.

14:38.568 --> 14:39.684
If he was easy to find,

14:39.686 --> 14:42.720
the books would be called
<i>There's Waldo.</i>

14:43.972 --> 14:49.009
57, 58, 59,
that's one minute.

14:52.214 --> 14:54.265
Long division,
long division.

14:54.267 --> 14:55.867
Go, go, go.

14:55.869 --> 14:58.185
Remember,
show your work.

14:59.020 --> 15:00.705
I'm okay.

15:00.707 --> 15:02.874
I'm okay.

15:05.661 --> 15:07.695
I'm not okay.

15:07.697 --> 15:10.865
Get up, we can't lose in math.

15:10.867 --> 15:12.333
37!
Yes!

15:12.335 --> 15:14.285
Aah!

15:14.287 --> 15:16.370
Ready, set, wrestle.

15:18.057 --> 15:20.341
One, two, three, pin.

15:20.343 --> 15:21.559
Mwah!

15:22.394 --> 15:24.395
Stop that.

15:24.397 --> 15:25.396
Mwah!

15:25.398 --> 15:26.397
Amy, do something.

15:26.399 --> 15:27.398
Mwah.

15:27.400 --> 15:28.900
Amy, help.

15:28.902 --> 15:31.319
W-- Amy, stop that.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.938
Amy, Penny,
both of you, stop it.

15:36.608 --> 15:39.577
One to beam aboard?

15:39.579 --> 15:41.579
Oh, my God, you're back.

15:42.665 --> 15:43.731
Oh, look at you.

15:43.733 --> 15:45.666
You, you look
like you grew.

15:45.668 --> 15:48.503
Yeah.

15:48.505 --> 15:50.838
The lack of gravity
did decompress my spine,

15:50.840 --> 15:53.207
so I'm like
an inch and a half taller.

15:53.209 --> 15:55.259
I'm going to the DMV tomorrow
to get my license changed

15:55.261 --> 15:56.911
before I shrink back.

15:56.913 --> 15:59.463
Oh, uh, come in, come in.

15:59.465 --> 16:01.516
Oh, I, uh, I didn't think
I was going to get

16:01.518 --> 16:02.733
to see you until tomorrow.

16:02.735 --> 16:05.136
Yeah, well,
Bernadette's a little

16:05.138 --> 16:06.270
under the weather

16:06.272 --> 16:10.441
and my mom's
kind of under my dentist.

16:10.443 --> 16:13.761
Wait, your, your mother
is sleeping with your dentist?

16:13.763 --> 16:15.062
Former dentist.

16:15.064 --> 16:17.865
I need a new one now that I know
where his hands have been.

16:17.867 --> 16:21.819
So you're wandering
all around by yourself?

16:21.821 --> 16:23.404
That's not the kind
of hero's welcome

16:23.406 --> 16:25.122
an astronaut should
come home to.

16:25.124 --> 16:27.742
It's okay, you know,
we space cowboys

16:27.744 --> 16:31.295
don't do what we do
for glory and fame.

16:31.297 --> 16:35.166
We leave that to your rock stars
and your athletes

16:35.168 --> 16:38.302
and your Howie Mandels.

16:39.137 --> 16:42.924
Oh, hey, man, welcome back.

16:42.926 --> 16:44.792
Oh, Stuart, thanks.

16:44.794 --> 16:46.277
What are you doing here?

16:46.279 --> 16:48.128
I, I kind of live here now.

16:48.130 --> 16:49.697
Just until he gets
back on his feet,

16:49.699 --> 16:51.015
which are looking pretty good

16:51.017 --> 16:53.901
in the boots I bought him
for his birthday.

16:56.939 --> 17:00.191
Ah, he's spoiling
me and I love it.

17:00.993 --> 17:05.496
Wow, so you guys
are like buds now?

17:05.498 --> 17:07.298
Oh, yeah, we hang out
all the time.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.566
Plus, he doesn't
have a girlfriend,

17:08.568 --> 17:09.750
I don't have
a girlfriend.

17:09.752 --> 17:11.117
It's like we both had
these holes

17:11.119 --> 17:15.006
in our lives, but now we fill
each other's holes.

17:19.361 --> 17:21.329
Uh...

17:21.330 --> 17:25.532
that sounds a little
funny to an American ear.

17:25.535 --> 17:26.834
Which part?

17:26.836 --> 17:29.670
Just all of it.

17:29.672 --> 17:31.171
Okay,

17:31.173 --> 17:33.691
so w-what do you guys
got going on tonight?

17:33.693 --> 17:37.078
Raj is taking me to the
<i>Sound of Music</i> sing-along.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.030
<i>Sound of Music</i> sing-along?

17:39.032 --> 17:41.449
That used to be our thing,
but that's cool.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.734
Oh, Howard,
it's still our thing.

17:43.736 --> 17:45.803
Come with us, we'll, we'll
get you a scalped ticket.

17:45.805 --> 17:48.673
So I'd be sitting by myself?

17:48.675 --> 17:49.790
We'll switch.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.592
You'll come sit with me
after intermission.

17:51.594 --> 17:55.212
So I-I-I'd be sitting by myself
during "Edelweiss"?

17:55.214 --> 17:56.847
No, no,

17:56.849 --> 17:58.182
you guys go.

17:58.184 --> 17:59.784
Have fun.

17:59.786 --> 18:01.385
Okay, uh, will I get
to see you tomorrow?

18:01.387 --> 18:02.219
Absolutely.

18:02.221 --> 18:03.370
See you, Stuart.

18:03.372 --> 18:05.723
Yeah, yeah.

18:05.725 --> 18:08.709
Is he taller?

18:10.679 --> 18:14.815
At least my mother made <i>her</i>
boyfriend climb out the window.

18:16.985 --> 18:21.388
All right, standard state fair
pie-eating contest rules are:

18:21.390 --> 18:24.325
no hands, first one
to clean the pan wins.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.311
On the count of three.

18:27.313 --> 18:29.447
One, two...

18:29.449 --> 18:31.682
Wait.

18:32.517 --> 18:34.669
I'm a little concerned.

18:34.671 --> 18:37.605
Blueberries are rich
in antioxidants.

18:37.607 --> 18:38.756
So?

18:38.758 --> 18:40.207
So, with all those antioxidants,

18:40.209 --> 18:42.610
what if I run out of oxidants?

18:45.764 --> 18:48.833
Sheldon, we haven't won
a game all night.

18:48.835 --> 18:51.235
Now, you either stick
your face in that pie

18:51.237 --> 18:54.572
or I'm gonna stick
that pie in your face.

18:57.425 --> 18:59.427
That's rude.

18:59.429 --> 19:04.031
One, two, three, eat.

19:12.991 --> 19:15.359
Hey, guys,
guess who's back from space.

19:15.361 --> 19:18.278
Not now!

19:21.833 --> 19:24.719
Oh, ow, blueberry
in my nose,

19:24.721 --> 19:26.887
blueberry in my nose!

19:26.889 --> 19:29.407
Snort it down
and keep eating!

19:43.974 --> 19:45.941
You look familiar.

19:45.943 --> 19:47.693
I don't think so.

19:47.695 --> 19:51.030
Yeah, I just saw you
on the news.

19:51.648 --> 19:52.982
You're an astronaut.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.283
Yes.

19:54.285 --> 19:55.501
Yes, I am.

19:55.503 --> 19:57.803
Good for you.

19:57.805 --> 20:00.056
How about a piece
of cheesecake on the house?

20:00.058 --> 20:01.741
Oh, thank you so much.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.209
I've been having
the worst night.

20:03.211 --> 20:05.077
I just got back,
and my friends don't care,

20:05.079 --> 20:06.695
my wife's sick,
I went to my mom...

20:06.697 --> 20:09.548
You want
the cheesecake or not?

20:10.917 --> 20:13.118
Yes, please.
