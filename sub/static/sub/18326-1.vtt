WEBVTT

01:51.861 --> 01:54.697
Smells like another job well done.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.951
What a shocking development.

01:58.576 --> 02:01.621
Not now, Mahoney.
We got a lot of paperwork to do.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.666
[Tory] And cut.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.210
Genius.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.712
Are we good on camera?

02:10.213 --> 02:11.381
How's sound? Good?

02:11.965 --> 02:16.219
All right, let's get the gimp down.
That's lunch. You guys are awesome.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.470
I love the ad-lib.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.098
Sandy, I'll be in my trailer.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.353
Yes. What do you guys think?
It's gonna be a classic.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.148
Yeah, in that B-movie genre maybe.

02:28.231 --> 02:30.316
-Yeah.
-You guys don't appreciate art.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.403
In this White Rabbit Project...

02:33.903 --> 02:36.948
we're going down the rabbit hole
of superpower tech

02:37.031 --> 02:40.743
to see which one
can best turn fiction... into fact.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.038
[Kari laughs]

02:44.122 --> 02:45.415
[Tory] Under the microscope:

02:46.749 --> 02:48.126
The power to freeze...

02:48.209 --> 02:49.794
[laughs]

02:49.878 --> 02:52.505
taking to the skies like Iron Man...

02:53.089 --> 02:55.633
The ultimate superpower. Done. Dusted.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.678
...and wielding lightning bolts
as a weapon.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.556
[Tory] Yeah! Get some!

03:02.974 --> 03:07.770
As usual, we'll score and rank
six contenders using three criteria.

03:08.479 --> 03:12.275
One is gonna be how much does it cost
to transform yourself into the superhero.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.360
[Kari] And how close is it
to the actual superpower

03:14.444 --> 03:16.279
you might see in movies or comic books.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.822
[Tory] And how easy it to use.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.491
Let's check out one of my favorites:
mind control.

03:23.786 --> 03:28.958
I found a guy in Ann Arbor, Michigan,
who thinks mind control is already here.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.503
And in his basement lurks
some truly weird science.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.589
-Greg.
-Hey, Kari.

03:35.256 --> 03:39.844
[Kari] Greg Gage and Backyard Brains Group
are bringing neuroscience to the people.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.013
We're neuroscience for the 99%.

03:43.097 --> 03:45.850
[Kari] Utilizing the maker community
and crowd-sourcing,

03:45.934 --> 03:49.062
designing accessible
and fun DIY experiments.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.022
These are my kind of people.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.692
My favorite thing is
our very first invention.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.985
It's called the SpikerBox.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.072
It allows you to record the neurons
from an animal

03:59.155 --> 04:00.949
and understand how that brain works.

04:01.032 --> 04:04.702
So, what we're gonna do
is sort of tap into that and do a biohack.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.705
-For example, a cyborg cockroach.
-I wanna know what that is.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.624
So, it is exactly what you think it is.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.877
It's a cockroach that
it's half biological system

04:12.961 --> 04:16.005
and half robot
and we merged the two together.

04:16.089 --> 04:21.552
I feel like you're almost on the edge
of some sort of superhero mind control.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.681
Like, this could be
your origin story right here.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.978
[Greg]
These are South American cockroaches.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.105
Are you ready to do this?

04:32.188 --> 04:33.106
-I think so.
-Okay.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.775
[Kari] I thought we were doing
human mind control,

04:35.858 --> 04:39.570
but apparently we're starting
at the creepier end of the food chain.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.323
I've got a bit of the heebie-jeebies,
but yes.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.742
-[Kari yells]
-Okay.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.245
I'm gonna take a cup
and what you're gonna do is

04:47.328 --> 04:50.248
take the cockroach
and dunk him into the ice water.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.334
-Where do you touch them?
-Just grab it from the side.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.919
[Kari laughs nervously]

04:55.003 --> 04:56.671
-Okay.
-Yeah you got it, you got it.

04:56.754 --> 04:57.755
Dunk, dunk, dunk!

04:57.839 --> 04:59.924
-Let go. Now, push it in.
-[screams]

05:00.008 --> 05:01.217
Can you grab it for me?

05:02.343 --> 05:03.428
Okay, sorry.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.848
Let me try that again.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.100
-Okay. I'm sorry, okay.
-All right. All right.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.727
-I'm cool, I'm cool.
-You're cool?

05:10.810 --> 05:13.229
-They're gonna get on me.
-Go, go, go.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.647
Okay. You did it.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.898
[groans]

05:16.482 --> 05:18.234
[Kari] With the cockroach anesthetized,

05:18.318 --> 05:21.487
it's time to turn this little guy
into robo-roach.

05:23.072 --> 05:26.326
Step two, uh... sandpaper his back?

05:28.453 --> 05:30.330
I have the weirdest job.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.665
The rough surface will ensure

05:32.749 --> 05:35.626
his circuit-board backpack
stays glued in place.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.171
Push down. He's good. All right, perfect.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.090
[Kari]
Next, I have to trim his antennae...

05:41.591 --> 05:42.967
[stammers]

05:43.468 --> 05:44.510
and, I kid you not,

05:44.594 --> 05:47.555
attach a teeny-tiny electrode wire
to each one.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.185
[grunts] Go in the hole.

05:52.268 --> 05:56.481
And all the while keeping him on ice
to make sure he doesn't wake up.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.275
-How do you know it's a him?
-Actually, I don't.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.652
[chuckles]
I'm not good at sexing cockroaches.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.196
There is a way. I just don't know how.

06:03.279 --> 06:06.115
Yeah, I've never sexed a cockroach either.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.452
With the antennae glued back in place,

06:09.535 --> 06:13.664
I need to earth the circuit
by inserting a wire into his thorax.

06:14.248 --> 06:18.294
And you know what? Congratulations.
You have just made your first cyborg.

06:18.377 --> 06:19.837
I made a cyborg!

06:21.047 --> 06:24.467
Now we just have to wait for him
to warm up and wake up.

06:24.550 --> 06:29.472
All right, now I've got him... plugged in
with his little roachy backpack.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.141
And he's mine. Mine!

06:32.225 --> 06:33.434
[Greg] Hit "pair."

06:34.477 --> 06:35.853
And now it's connecting.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.730
I control you, little roach.

06:38.314 --> 06:39.190
What?

06:39.273 --> 06:40.691
Swipe left, he goes left.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.110
That is neat-o.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.654
Swipe right... he goes right.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.489
How am I doing it?

06:47.115 --> 06:50.076
When I signal the electrode
inside the antennae

06:50.159 --> 06:53.663
his little roachy brain believes
he's touched something and turns away.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.040
Okay, this is awesome,

06:56.124 --> 06:58.626
but I wanna figure out
how I can apply this to humans.

06:58.709 --> 07:01.045
-You wanna control humans?
-I wanna control humans.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.048
I'm just gonna hook you up
to another one of our inventions.

07:04.132 --> 07:05.466
This is the Muscle SpikerBox.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.179
[Kari] The SpikerBox hones in
on neuron activity in the motor cortex...

07:10.888 --> 07:13.015
the bit of the brain
that controls movement.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.351
So, go ahead and squeeze your hand.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.396
-Whoa.
-Look at that.

07:18.479 --> 07:21.691
This is your brain being amplified
through your muscles.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.278
The next question is,
what can we do with that signal?

07:25.361 --> 07:28.281
We can stick it
into a little computer here.

07:28.364 --> 07:31.492
So, this is a way to make
a brain-machine interface.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.287
Now you're controlling this.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.705
That is cool.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.291
I'm controlling a machine with my mind.

07:38.374 --> 07:43.463
Now, can we take that one step further
and control a human?

07:43.546 --> 07:46.466
My brain is sending a command
down to my arm.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.050
We're gonna pick up that signal

07:48.134 --> 07:50.970
and we're gonna send it over to your arm.
All right.

07:51.053 --> 07:54.515
You can kind of look in that direction,
so you don't look directly at me.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.641
[Kari laughs]

07:55.725 --> 07:57.185
-You feel something yet?
-Yeah.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.644
Turning it up a bit more.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.521
[yelps]

08:00.605 --> 08:01.689
What the hell?

08:02.148 --> 08:03.483
That's so weird!

08:03.566 --> 08:05.985
So, when I do this--
And I can do it whenever I want.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.069
And all of a sudden...

08:07.153 --> 08:08.571
[shrieks]

08:09.739 --> 08:11.073
So, we now know how it works.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.659
Your brain is also sending
the command down there

08:13.743 --> 08:16.162
but we've just
kind of hijacked that system,

08:16.245 --> 08:17.955
sending our own pulses in there,

08:18.039 --> 08:20.541
making that neuron fire
and causing this hand to move.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.085
-That is so weird.
-All right, one more time.

08:23.794 --> 08:24.712
Okay.

08:24.795 --> 08:27.006
-Now we're gonna add a new muscle.
-Okay.

08:27.089 --> 08:30.510
Which is this bicep here.
So, if I squeeze my arm up...

08:30.593 --> 08:34.222
Oh, so now we've got different function.
I can do this one, or this one.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.767
-This is weird.
-Okay, so...

08:37.850 --> 08:40.394
-I'm punching myself.
-Why are you hitting yourself?

08:40.478 --> 08:43.147
All right, so we can do
smaller muscles like this,

08:43.231 --> 08:44.482
or gross ones like this.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.984
All right.
So, can we do some cool stuff with this?

08:47.068 --> 08:49.153
-I think this is amazing.
-All right.

08:49.237 --> 08:52.156
I have some evil genius ideas
for some fun with this tech.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.074
Let's do it.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.701
[Italian music playing]

08:58.663 --> 08:59.497
[Tory] Hey.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.250
-Hi.
-What's up? You invited me to dinner?

09:02.333 --> 09:05.169
Did I forget to tell you
it was going to be completely filmed

09:05.253 --> 09:07.088
-and actually on the show?
-Yeah, why?

09:07.171 --> 09:09.924
-I've picked out what I'd like to order.
-I don't trust you.

09:10.007 --> 09:11.926
-Calm yourself, there'll be wines.
-Okay.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.469
Hello. How are you doing today?

09:13.553 --> 09:14.387
-Good.
-Good.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.138
What can I get you started off with?

09:17.056 --> 09:19.141
Spaghetti and meatballs for this guy.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.687
This is going to be one meal
Tory will never forget.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.025
[Grant] Tory might be happy
to order off the menu...

09:30.736 --> 09:32.947
but when I think of a superpower,

09:33.447 --> 09:36.909
you want something exotic,
something that pushes the boundaries.

09:37.410 --> 09:41.247
But it also has to be usable,
which means some sort of weapon.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.214
And if you want a super-weapon,

09:50.298 --> 09:52.800
what you need is an evil genius.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.761
[cackling]

09:55.845 --> 09:57.013
And my superpower?

09:57.555 --> 10:01.684
The ability to freeze
using a bolt of cold so intense

10:01.767 --> 10:04.937
it will literally suck the heat
right out of my enemies.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.148
This is liquid nitrogen.

10:07.732 --> 10:11.068
Its temperature is minus 320 degrees.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.195
Let's do this.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.907
Take bovine mammary secretion,

10:17.283 --> 10:20.369
add C12-H22-O11...

10:21.829 --> 10:22.872
whisk...

10:24.040 --> 10:25.583
now for LN2,

10:25.666 --> 10:28.544
one of the coldest substances
on the planet,

10:28.628 --> 10:29.754
to create...

10:34.508 --> 10:38.679
Imagine, if I perfected this weapon,
I could make ice cream at will.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.474
But that's no good to me.

10:41.557 --> 10:44.393
I want to wield my superpower for evil.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.191
I want to test
liquid nitrogen's destructive qualities.

10:51.192 --> 10:53.319
Unhappy Valentine's Day!

10:57.156 --> 10:59.617
[laughs]

11:00.618 --> 11:03.829
Here's what I think of your "apple a day."

11:05.498 --> 11:07.249
You say "tomato"...

11:07.875 --> 11:08.959
I say...

11:10.002 --> 11:12.505
I never did like vegetables.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.264
Okay, so I am definitely
on the right track,

11:22.348 --> 11:25.351
but in order to achieve
full super-villain status,

11:25.434 --> 11:26.602
I need to weaponize this.

11:28.312 --> 11:31.732
Behold... the industrial cryogun.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.359
Witness the power.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.905
This is actually a medical instrument

11:37.988 --> 11:40.950
intended for freezing off warts
and things like that.

11:41.617 --> 11:45.955
Now, it's all very well and good
taking out a rose at short range, but...

11:46.539 --> 11:50.292
I ask you, is this the weapon
of an evil mastermind?

11:50.793 --> 11:51.752
I think not.

11:51.836 --> 11:55.339
So, as usual...
if I want something done evil,

11:55.923 --> 11:57.425
I'm gonna have to do it myself.

11:58.884 --> 11:59.885
Time to supersize.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.765
Here's what I'm trying to do:
build a gun that is capable

12:04.849 --> 12:08.978
of firing a solid, continuous stream
of liquid nitrogen.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.606
To do this,
I have a giant liquid-nitrogen tank,

12:12.690 --> 12:14.859
a vacuum-jacketed cryogenic hose...

12:15.443 --> 12:17.403
This is how Gandalf summons the elves.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.948
[mimics bugle]

12:21.449 --> 12:23.242
And a cryogenic solenoid valve.

12:23.325 --> 12:26.787
All these parts constitute
the guts of my superweapon,

12:26.871 --> 12:30.416
which should be able
to freeze my enemies to their core.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.546
Curses.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.967
It might look cool,
but actually... it's warm,

12:40.509 --> 12:43.137
a major setback
when you're trying to be Dr. Ice.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.348
The problem is
the high ambient temperature in here.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.560
I need a stream of freezing-cold liquid,

12:50.019 --> 12:52.813
not a cloud of namby-pamby vapor.

12:55.649 --> 12:57.568
Foiled again by thermodynamics.

12:58.152 --> 13:01.614
I need to test my weapon
in a much colder atmosphere.

13:01.697 --> 13:02.573
So, bring out...

13:05.075 --> 13:06.160
the thermo bucket.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.913
This will keep the cold from escaping.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.081
So, I got my insulated bucket...

13:11.916 --> 13:14.376
pointed the tip of the gun
into the bucket,

13:14.460 --> 13:15.628
fired everything off...

13:18.672 --> 13:21.008
Lo and behold, liquid.

13:23.260 --> 13:26.305
Hey, survived the most dangerous thing
I did today.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.894
So, what this says is that
this whole gun is going to work.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.104
It's going to fire off a stream of liquid,

13:34.188 --> 13:37.316
it just has to be in a cold, cold place.

13:42.321 --> 13:46.367
[Tory] For my chosen superpower,
I wanna wield lightning as a weapon.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.621
Challenge one,
find a massive electrical charge.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.500
Then figure out how to harness that charge
to produce lightning bolts...

13:55.876 --> 13:59.088
and finally, hurl those bolts directly
at my enemies

13:59.171 --> 14:00.839
without getting zapped myself.

14:02.758 --> 14:05.553
There will be no, and I repeat,
no margin for error...

14:10.599 --> 14:14.395
because a single lightning bolt contains
up to one billion volts.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.732
If I'm gonna survive this...

14:21.777 --> 14:23.320
I need an expert.

14:24.321 --> 14:27.366
Luckily, Aron fools around
with lightning for a living...

14:29.285 --> 14:31.370
using a gadget called a Tesla coil.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.416
What exactly is a Tesla coil?

14:35.791 --> 14:40.170
A Tesla coil is a high frequency
air-core resonant transformer.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.215
Okay, now in layman's terms.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.759
It's a system that allows us
to take a low voltage

14:45.843 --> 14:47.678
and turn it into a really high voltage.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.973
Yes. That's what I wanted to hear.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.269
Nikola Tesla gave the coil its name.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.856
The Serbian-American invented it in 1891.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.484
Tesla was eccentric.
He had a phobia about women's earrings

15:02.568 --> 15:05.029
and believed he came
from the planet Venus,

15:05.112 --> 15:09.074
but he's considered a genius
for his work on wireless electricity

15:09.783 --> 15:11.660
and his supercharging coil.

15:11.744 --> 15:15.080
So, how much super-power
can we generate from the coil?

15:15.581 --> 15:19.001
The input,
it's only about 40 amps at 240 volts.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.337
Nothing too crazy going on there.

15:21.921 --> 15:26.550
The output, a million volts
at 1.4 megawatts of power.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.303
Megawatt.
That's the name of my superhero.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.182
[Aron] Let's get this panel off
right here.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.266
[Tory] Okay.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.812
Would it be like a storm cloud
building up electricity

15:38.896 --> 15:42.358
-and then releasing a lightning bolt?
-Yeah, it's just like that actually.

15:42.441 --> 15:45.611
You're storing energy in the cloud
then the lightning bolt arcs out.

15:45.694 --> 15:48.405
Well, here we store that energy
in some capacitors

15:48.489 --> 15:52.701
and then our solid-state circuit dumps it
all into the Tesla coil really quick.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.122
-Here we go.
-Yes.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.708
[Aron] We limit the arcs out of
this system to about ten feet.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.002
-What? Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.672
So, you could actually
hit something ten feet away

16:04.755 --> 16:07.383
with one of these giant arcs of lightning?

16:07.466 --> 16:08.300
That's right.

16:08.550 --> 16:09.551
What the--?

16:12.554 --> 16:15.975
Captain Megawatt can't stand on the floor
when the charge hits him,

16:16.058 --> 16:17.142
or he'll be fried.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.980
This platform will separate him
from the ground,

16:21.063 --> 16:24.024
and industrial insulators will mean
he's not earthed.

16:24.108 --> 16:27.444
This thing looks like something
out of a high-voltage power line.

16:27.528 --> 16:30.239
It looks like something
out of a substation, because it is.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.949
That's crazy.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.580
To make this theoretically less risky...

16:39.248 --> 16:41.458
let's double down on the insulators.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.129
It looks good. Well done.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.548
I'm gonna sit here
while you do all the hard work.

16:48.090 --> 16:52.428
Before I commit to getting on the platform
and becoming a human lightning rod,

16:52.511 --> 16:55.014
I wanna see exactly what I'm in for...

16:55.556 --> 16:57.808
from what I've been told
is a safe distance.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.353
That means
if you walk over that white line...

17:01.437 --> 17:02.271
[Aron] It's on.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.440
...that would be
the last mistake you made.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.651
[woman] We're going hot.

17:07.985 --> 17:09.278
We're going hot.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.487
[Aron] You got it.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.781
[Tory laughs excitedly]

17:12.865 --> 17:16.702
Whenever I'm close to something
that could potentially kill me,

17:16.785 --> 17:17.745
I start giggling.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.788
Maybe it's a nervous reaction
or something.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.124
Here it comes.

17:35.012 --> 17:35.846
Dude!

17:35.929 --> 17:37.765
That's one million volts.

17:37.973 --> 17:39.600
That is a massive electric charge.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.311
Challenge one? Check.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.856
[laughs nervously]

17:46.607 --> 17:49.109
Like I say, imminent death, and I giggle.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.236
Now for challenge number two.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.781
Harness that charge without getting fried.

17:54.364 --> 17:57.034
Now, you might think
a nice thick rubber suit.

17:59.703 --> 18:00.871
I get chain mail.

18:02.790 --> 18:03.624
Why you ask?

18:06.502 --> 18:11.673
Basically, this is a Faraday suit,
and it is way more conductive than we are.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.717
That's perfect. That's awesome.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.970
Meet Tesla coil showman
and Aron's partner in crime.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.808
When the electricity touches the suit,

18:20.891 --> 18:23.102
it would much rather crawl
along the surface

18:23.185 --> 18:26.146
than go inside the monkey,
who's not very conductive.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.816
So, it's easier for electricity
to pass through the suit

18:28.899 --> 18:30.400
-than our bodies.
-Exactly.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.487
[Tory] The suit gets its name

18:33.570 --> 18:36.949
from 19th-century
English visionary Michael Faraday.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.285
Suits weren't his claim to fame,

18:40.369 --> 18:43.122
although he pulls this one off
pretty well.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.457
But what he did invent

18:45.541 --> 18:49.461
was a cage that allowed electricity
to pass around its exterior...

18:50.379 --> 18:52.506
leaving the interior untouched.

18:53.257 --> 18:57.553
So, basically, this suit is the only thing
that's keeping you alive.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.971
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

19:00.264 --> 19:03.642
[Tory] If there's a hole
or even a chink in the Faraday suit,

19:03.725 --> 19:06.395
I could feel the full force
of that million volts

19:06.478 --> 19:08.147
on whatever's exposed.

19:11.316 --> 19:13.318
[Michael]
I'm gonna get a little personal on you.

19:13.402 --> 19:14.778
Just another day at the office.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.989
Yeah, like that.

19:17.739 --> 19:20.284
Meanwhile at the dungeon convention...

19:20.993 --> 19:22.911
Ravenwood is checking
for holes in the suit.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.914
Hey, guys, you forgot to torture me.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.501
But I think he's being
a little too thorough.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.423
Like all superheroes, I need a foe.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.593
How about a squad of deadly ninjas?

19:38.177 --> 19:39.970
Let's do this before I change my mind.

19:40.053 --> 19:42.514
Invincible. Their only Achilles' heel?

19:43.098 --> 19:45.893
Methane-filled balloon heads.

19:47.561 --> 19:50.939
So, quick recap.
Massive electrical charge?

19:52.524 --> 19:53.358
Check.

19:54.484 --> 19:55.986
Way to harness it and not die?

19:58.280 --> 19:59.698
Uh, check?

20:00.407 --> 20:03.535
Now, how to turn that charge
into lightning bolts.

20:04.077 --> 20:05.120
My wand.

20:06.496 --> 20:09.541
Wrapped up in chain mail,
bound by leather restraints,

20:09.625 --> 20:12.711
and tethered by my crotch
ten feet above the ground,

20:12.794 --> 20:16.006
I'm about to allow
a million volts of electricity

20:16.089 --> 20:18.008
to be pumped around my body.

20:19.092 --> 20:21.887
What in the hell am I doing up here?

20:23.263 --> 20:24.556
[Michael] Here it comes, Tory.

20:28.477 --> 20:32.189
Prepare to feel the wrath
of Captain Megawatt!

20:32.522 --> 20:34.733
You ready for this, ninjas?

20:37.778 --> 20:38.612
Ah! [bleep]

20:39.363 --> 20:41.907
It's shocking the [bleep] out
of my fingers.

20:42.616 --> 20:43.617
It feels like a Taser.

20:44.117 --> 20:47.037
Your glove probably has a hole in it
or tore or something.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.248
You trying to [bleep] kill me or what?

20:49.331 --> 20:53.627
What the [bleep] are you guys doing there?
Should I try left hand?

20:54.211 --> 20:56.505
[Michael] You know what?
That's actually not a bad idea.

20:57.005 --> 20:57.839
On.

21:01.301 --> 21:04.930
Okay, there's electricity
coming out of my thumb.

21:08.850 --> 21:09.810
Yeah, that felt--

21:09.893 --> 21:12.229
I didn't feel anything that time.
Let's try this again.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.481
Yeah. Yeah.

21:20.737 --> 21:23.991
Ninjas, I'm about to light you up
like Christmas trees!

21:28.787 --> 21:29.871
Ninja, die.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.208
Yeah, get some!

21:33.709 --> 21:34.543
Oh!

21:35.377 --> 21:36.211
Take that!

21:38.755 --> 21:42.718
[whooping and laughing]

21:45.137 --> 21:47.014
That was incredible.

21:47.097 --> 21:49.933
It was terrifying 'cause I had no idea
what was gonna happen,

21:50.017 --> 21:52.060
but as soon as the Tesla coil went on,

21:52.144 --> 21:55.063
I literally had electricity
shooting out my fingers.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.442
And to be able to control
those giant arcs of lightning...

21:58.900 --> 22:00.277
I feel like a superhero.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.988
Oh, my God! That's crazy!

22:03.530 --> 22:06.742
Were you scared the first time
they put electricity through you?

22:06.825 --> 22:10.620
It hurt like hell. It felt like somebody
taking a Taser to my hand.

22:10.704 --> 22:12.873
As he turned it up,
it got worse and I was like:

22:12.956 --> 22:15.208
I don't think this is supposed
to feel like this.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.502
So, how close is this
to a real superpower?

22:17.586 --> 22:19.671
-It looks like a real superpower.
-Yeah.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.716
I mean, I was able
to control the electricity,

22:22.924 --> 22:26.219
harness it to the point where
I could actually fire and hit my targets,

22:26.303 --> 22:29.139
and if you got hit by one of those bolts,
it would kill you.

22:29.222 --> 22:32.267
I think as far as that goes, high marks.

22:32.350 --> 22:36.229
-Very close to a real superpower.
-Yeah. How much does the whole setup cost?

22:36.313 --> 22:40.275
It's not so bad. $5,000 for the suit.
$8,000 for the tower,

22:40.358 --> 22:42.611
and $125,000 for the Tesla coil.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.488
-What?
-Dude, that's super expensive!

22:44.571 --> 22:47.199
That's like $138,000.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.160
I run in the crowds
with Batman and Iron Man.

22:50.243 --> 22:52.621
Oh, you're one of those
one-percenter superheroes.

22:52.704 --> 22:53.914
Yes, I am.

22:53.997 --> 22:57.042
Well, I think usability's where
this one starts to break down.

22:57.125 --> 23:00.378
You need a very large,
very specialized piece of equipment

23:00.462 --> 23:02.923
that has to get plugged
into a power source.

23:03.423 --> 23:06.968
As far as usability goes,
it barely squeaks by...

23:07.052 --> 23:08.887
so maybe somewhere in the middle?

23:11.765 --> 23:14.851
[Kari] Back at the restaurant,
mind control is on the menu.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.187
I've come pre-wired.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.564
I'm gonna make dinner a little more fun.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.191
Now it's Tory's turn.

23:21.274 --> 23:23.026
-This is getting so good.
-Who's that?

23:24.111 --> 23:26.321
Just roll up your sleeves a bit
for a second.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.908
-Not weird at all.
-Not at all.

23:29.991 --> 23:31.451
You thought
you were just coming to dinner.

23:31.535 --> 23:32.369
I did.

23:32.452 --> 23:36.581
And I was looking forward to this meal,
and now I'm absolutely not.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.875
First, we're gonna take
these electrode pads,

23:38.959 --> 23:42.295
and he's gonna put them on different
places on your arm. Same as me, look.

23:42.796 --> 23:45.173
Don't be scared.
We're going through the same thing.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.300
And I'd never do anything weird to myself.

23:47.384 --> 23:48.552
[Tory] That's not true.

23:48.635 --> 23:52.139
[Kari] And to spice things up a bit,
I'm also adding mouth control.

23:52.848 --> 23:53.890
[Greg] That's good. Bite down.

23:54.349 --> 23:56.518
All right, that seems to work. Okay.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.062
-Is that freaking you out at all?
-Not at all.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.063
[laughs]

24:00.730 --> 24:03.442
All right, you're all hooked up,
so, bon appétit.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.779
Now that we are properly dressed
for dinner, just one more thing.

24:10.031 --> 24:10.907
Safety glasses?

24:16.079 --> 24:17.330
Would you pour the wine?

24:17.414 --> 24:19.166
[stammers]

24:25.839 --> 24:27.507
What the [bleep]?

24:27.591 --> 24:28.925
Why?

24:29.009 --> 24:31.094
What the hell? Why are we doing this?

24:31.636 --> 24:33.013
Just pour the wine, it's fine.

24:33.096 --> 24:36.016
-I had nightmares like this.
-Go ahead, it's cool. It's cool.

24:36.099 --> 24:39.060
[laughing]

24:39.144 --> 24:41.521
Stop moving! It hurts.

24:41.605 --> 24:42.981
It's good. I'm holding still.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.609
How is this--? Why is this happening?

24:46.109 --> 24:49.446
My brain is signaling these electro pads
to move my arm,

24:49.529 --> 24:52.616
and my arms are signaling you
to move yours.

24:52.699 --> 24:53.950
So, you can control me.

24:57.996 --> 24:58.997
This is torture.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.957
I can't even enjoy my dinner!

25:01.041 --> 25:02.292
Don't disobey me!

25:03.376 --> 25:04.920
Are you gonna stop?

25:05.462 --> 25:07.797
-I'm stuck.
-Sorry. Really?

25:07.881 --> 25:10.342
-Why is that--?
-[Greg] Are you really stuck?

25:10.425 --> 25:13.470
No, I'm just standing like this
for my health.

25:14.262 --> 25:15.513
We're having a glitch.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.391
Whoa!

25:18.475 --> 25:19.768
What the--?

25:21.102 --> 25:22.604
Turn it off. Oh!

25:22.812 --> 25:25.273
[Kari] So, it turns out
you don't want to pair merlot

25:25.357 --> 25:27.567
and sensitive prototype electronics.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.611
Is there like a kill-switch?

25:29.694 --> 25:31.529
[stammers]

25:33.657 --> 25:38.495
I think I'm gonna have a talk with the...
show runners on this particular...

25:39.704 --> 25:40.580
show.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.584
[Grant]
For my second superpower contender,

25:44.668 --> 25:46.127
I'm kicking it up a notch.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.381
Ever since I was a kid,

25:49.464 --> 25:52.467
I've thought one of the most
underrated, sneakiest,

25:52.550 --> 25:56.429
and possibly most useful superpowers
was invisibility.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.557
But as far as it ever becoming a reality,

25:58.640 --> 26:01.476
it's also been one of the most elusive
for scientists.

26:03.144 --> 26:04.980
A breakthrough came in 2012

26:05.272 --> 26:08.984
when Dr. Susumu Tachi
and his team at the University of Tokyo

26:09.067 --> 26:11.111
debuted their invisibility cloak.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.113
And this is how it works.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.825
It's called
Retro-Reflective Projection Technology.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.744
It creates the illusion of invisibility

26:19.828 --> 26:22.455
by projecting background images
onto a subject

26:22.539 --> 26:24.583
wearing specialized clothing.

26:24.666 --> 26:28.211
Dr. Tachi believes this technology
could eventually be used

26:28.295 --> 26:31.006
to render all kinds
of visual obstructions invisible.

26:31.089 --> 26:33.216
And it turns out he's right.

26:34.092 --> 26:37.595
Land Rover has developed
a see-through trailer concept.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.931
Video from the backup
and side-mirror cameras

26:40.015 --> 26:42.642
combine with a camera
on the very back of the trailer

26:42.726 --> 26:45.103
that essentially renders it invisible.

26:45.687 --> 26:49.316
Now, trailers are one thing,
but let's kick this up a notch.

26:49.399 --> 26:50.775
How about a skyscraper?

26:51.359 --> 26:53.403
In South Korea, plans are underway

26:53.486 --> 26:56.823
to build the world's
first invisible skyscraper.

26:57.324 --> 27:02.120
The plan is to cover a 1,500-foot tower
with LED screens.

27:02.662 --> 27:05.665
Eighteen cameras in strategic points
all over the building

27:05.749 --> 27:08.835
will capture real-time images
of the surroundings,

27:08.918 --> 27:13.548
which will then be processed and displayed
on the building's LED screens.

27:13.631 --> 27:16.009
Voila, the building is gone.

27:16.968 --> 27:19.220
All this technology is well and good,

27:19.304 --> 27:22.265
but I'm just not feeling
the superpower vibe here.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.477
What about the concept
of physically bending light

27:25.560 --> 27:27.270
to create true invisibility?

27:27.520 --> 27:29.022
Can it ever be achieved?

27:29.105 --> 27:32.275
Well, the inventors of the Rochester Cloak
seem to think so.

27:36.237 --> 27:39.449
This is the first device of its kind
known to science

27:39.532 --> 27:44.913
that is capable of simultaneously creating
a three-dimensional, continuous,

27:44.996 --> 27:47.791
real-time illusion of invisibility.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.336
Let me walk you through the setup.

27:52.212 --> 27:56.007
The distances between the lenses
are precisely calculated

27:56.091 --> 27:57.675
based on the focal points.

27:58.885 --> 28:03.598
Everything needs to be precisely
and meticulously leveled, trued,

28:03.681 --> 28:05.392
and aligned using a laser.

28:05.975 --> 28:09.479
The image of the background
is passed through the array

28:09.854 --> 28:10.939
to the observer.

28:11.564 --> 28:13.441
The lenses bend the light...

28:13.525 --> 28:17.445
then here between the final two lenses,
the light converges...

28:18.279 --> 28:20.865
creating a cylinder of invisibility.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.952
Put my hand in the right position
between these lenses,

28:24.035 --> 28:25.662
and it'll become invisible.

28:25.745 --> 28:26.746
Here we go.

28:30.625 --> 28:33.211
See how my fingers
have disappeared at the edge?

28:33.545 --> 28:35.547
That's because
there's a cylindrical zone

28:35.630 --> 28:39.426
where the light is bent around my fingers,
creating invisibility.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.014
But if an object crosses
into the center of the cylinder,

28:45.098 --> 28:47.308
the light hits it and it can be seen.

28:48.476 --> 28:52.689
Imagine if you could create this
on a scale to hide a person.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.151
Then you'd have a superpower.

28:56.234 --> 28:59.446
Wow, that was pretty cool.
You made part of your body disappear.

28:59.529 --> 29:02.031
No one will ever know
where this finger comes from.

29:02.615 --> 29:04.909
Okay, let's break it down. Invisibility.

29:04.993 --> 29:07.620
First of all,
how much does that setup cost you?

29:07.704 --> 29:11.249
That setup was pretty inexpensive,
about 200 bucks.

29:11.332 --> 29:15.003
The problem is if you wanna get
any larger than a 2-inch image,

29:15.086 --> 29:16.546
the cost goes up exponentially.

29:16.629 --> 29:17.922
What about usability?

29:18.423 --> 29:19.674
Look, um...

29:19.758 --> 29:22.260
It's really hard to set up.
It's hard to keep aligned.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.262
[Kari] Similarity to a superpower?

29:24.763 --> 29:28.892
You have to stay in this specific part
of the lens arrangement...

29:28.975 --> 29:31.060
to even be partially cloaked.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.481
All right, so we're not gonna
be seeing any Predator invisibility suits

29:34.564 --> 29:36.816
any time soon,
unless they come from outer space.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.151
-Not quite there.
-Okay.

29:46.409 --> 29:48.077
[Kari] Is it a bird? Is it a plane?

29:49.454 --> 29:52.040
No. It's Jetman.

29:54.709 --> 29:58.004
I mean, all the coolest superheroes
possess the power of flight:

29:58.087 --> 30:00.590
Iron Man, Superman, Green Lantern.

30:00.673 --> 30:04.719
Hands down, flying has gotta be
the coolest of all the superhero powers.

30:05.303 --> 30:06.304
And this...

30:07.347 --> 30:08.973
is as close to flying as it gets.

30:11.392 --> 30:14.604
Former fighter pilot Yves Rossy
and his protégé, Vince Reffet...

30:15.271 --> 30:18.233
have pioneered flying
with a powered Jet Wing.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.364
It sounds like a death wish,

30:24.948 --> 30:29.077
but what they're doing
over the skies of Dubai is mind-blowing.

30:29.702 --> 30:33.623
The Jet Wing is revolutionary because
Yves and Vince aren't flying a machine.

30:33.706 --> 30:35.208
Their bodies are the fuselage.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.672
Yves, you've spent 20 years
of R & D on the Jet Wing.

30:40.755 --> 30:42.215
Talk me through the process.

30:42.298 --> 30:46.553
It was really learning by doing
and a step-by-step development.

30:49.597 --> 30:53.601
At the beginning,
I didn't expect to put engines on.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.479
And when I had a gliding performance,

30:56.563 --> 31:01.943
it would be good to sustain flight,
so put two engines, small engines.

31:05.238 --> 31:08.658
It works, great,
but birds, they are not only falling...

31:09.409 --> 31:10.743
they are climbing.

31:13.037 --> 31:15.081
It would be good to fly up.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.918
Then we did add two more engines

31:22.046 --> 31:25.425
The Jet Wing has evolved
through 15 prototypes into this:

31:26.175 --> 31:30.096
A turbo-charged jet-propelled wing
composed of three main parts:

31:31.139 --> 31:34.309
First, the carbon-fiber wing
gives the flier lift.

31:35.602 --> 31:38.813
Then... four jet engines,
powered by kerosene,

31:38.897 --> 31:40.773
each with 88 pounds of thrust.

31:41.024 --> 31:43.776
They can push the flier
to a cool 200 miles an hour.

31:43.860 --> 31:46.738
Not as fast a speeding bullet,
but pretty freaking fast.

31:47.322 --> 31:51.075
And then... a fiberglass harness
that straps the wing to the body.

31:51.159 --> 31:54.245
The flier does have to wear
a fireproof suit, of course,

31:54.329 --> 31:56.998
and has two parachutes
as a safety precaution.

32:02.420 --> 32:05.632
They can launch
from an altitude of 7000 feet.

32:05.715 --> 32:09.385
They have a maximum of 15 minutes
of flying time before the fuel runs out.

32:11.387 --> 32:13.890
Which leaves plenty of time
for some aerobatics

32:13.973 --> 32:15.934
around the world's tallest building.

32:25.944 --> 32:29.447
It looks incredible,
but what does flying feel like?

32:29.948 --> 32:33.076
[Yves] The feeling is... completely free.

32:33.159 --> 32:35.578
We are very close to birds...

32:36.287 --> 32:41.167
and that's a kind of super ability
to be able to fly for a human.

32:43.419 --> 32:46.089
We are not flying a machine.
It's the opposite.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.175
The machine follows us.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.888
I feel like this is a 100%
bona fide superpower.

32:54.180 --> 32:55.515
The only drawback is that,

32:55.598 --> 32:58.017
well, Superman can take off
and land by himself,

32:58.101 --> 33:01.354
and Jetman, he does need a chopper
and a parachute.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.773
But still, I think this is incredible.

33:07.276 --> 33:09.237
What's the future for the Jet Wing?

33:09.320 --> 33:11.698
And more importantly,
when can I fly in one?

33:11.781 --> 33:15.493
[Yves] At this point,
it's still a little bit too complicated,

33:15.576 --> 33:17.954
and it's really for experienced people.

33:18.037 --> 33:19.706
The problem now...

33:20.707 --> 33:23.292
It's expensive,
you know, it's really high tech.

33:23.960 --> 33:28.256
[Kari] They're not available to buy,
but if they were, they'd be pricey.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.550
Yves says about the same as a supercar.

33:32.677 --> 33:37.557
But for sure in the future
that's our goal, to be autonomous.

33:37.640 --> 33:40.351
Don't need any more helicopter
or an airplane.

33:41.728 --> 33:47.066
I hope that in a few years
it will be the Jet Ski of the air.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.575
Well, that's it folks. Flying.

33:55.658 --> 33:56.826
The Jet Wing.

33:57.410 --> 34:00.413
The ultimate superpower. Done, dusted.

34:01.330 --> 34:05.001
[Grant] Not so fast, Kari.
Dr. Ice is just warming up.

34:10.006 --> 34:14.510
We know liquid-nitrogen dip will freeze
all manner of fruits and vegetables.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.682
But when I tried to create a weapon

34:19.766 --> 34:22.643
that can fire a freezing bolt
over ten feet...

34:23.561 --> 34:25.855
the warm ambient temperature
of the workshop

34:25.938 --> 34:27.857
sent my plans up in smoke.

34:28.441 --> 34:30.985
Or to be more precise... vapor.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.237
That's why I've got this.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.741
A refrigerated truck.

34:39.202 --> 34:42.080
Now, all I have to do
is lure my nemesis inside

34:42.163 --> 34:44.165
without arousing suspicion.

34:56.677 --> 34:59.555
[in creepy voice]
Would you like an apple, my pretty?

34:59.639 --> 35:00.890
[cackles]

35:01.390 --> 35:02.683
[in normal voice] Okay, here we go,

35:02.767 --> 35:07.188
this is liquid nitrogen versus the apple
in three, two, one.

35:09.607 --> 35:10.608
[chuckling]

35:10.691 --> 35:12.610
You can see the liquid hitting it.

35:13.986 --> 35:17.365
Good. Now we just have to see
if it freezes solid.

35:24.622 --> 35:25.748
Moment of truth.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.667
Three, two, one.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.253
[laughs]

35:30.336 --> 35:33.881
Okay. So, it works, which is awesome.

35:34.298 --> 35:37.218
I've achieved my superpower of freezing.

35:37.301 --> 35:40.721
The only problem is,
in actuality, it doesn't really work,

35:40.805 --> 35:43.975
because it completely fails
in the area of practicality.

35:44.684 --> 35:46.602
It only has a range of two to three feet.

35:46.686 --> 35:50.398
The subject has to remain completely still
for five to ten minutes,

35:50.481 --> 35:55.236
and it can only be deployed
in an already-freezing environment.

35:56.487 --> 35:59.615
Don't worry...
I've got one more trick up my sleeve.

36:03.661 --> 36:07.290
Like all super-villains,
Dr. Ice has an arch nemesis.

36:13.588 --> 36:15.214
Meet Captain Ribeye.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.051
The stakes are high.

36:19.552 --> 36:22.430
I have to insta-freeze him
like a popsicle...

36:23.472 --> 36:25.516
from over ten feet away.

36:26.642 --> 36:28.019
But here's the thing.

36:28.102 --> 36:31.814
I don't need to freeze him solid.
I just need to freeze him in his tracks.

36:32.940 --> 36:36.402
And I think all I need for that
is some good old H2O.

36:36.485 --> 36:39.906
I know my cryogun can generate
extreme cold.

36:40.656 --> 36:44.160
And I know that water freezes
at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.037
By combining the two,

36:46.245 --> 36:48.956
I should be able
to create a frozen layer of ice

36:49.040 --> 36:53.252
around my target, instantaneously,
from a distance.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.671
[cackles]

36:57.298 --> 36:59.383
Minions, to me.

36:59.842 --> 37:01.469
There's work to be done.

37:02.261 --> 37:04.680
So, let's get this nemesis... wet.

37:05.431 --> 37:06.641
Soft Serve.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.518
We're gonna hit him with the bucket.
On three.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.271
Then a blast of my liquid nitrogen.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.941
Three, two, one.

37:33.125 --> 37:35.461
Looks like we've only managed
to make him angry.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.172
That's what you get
when you rely on a minion.

37:39.131 --> 37:43.010
I need to build a water-delivery system
into the cryogun itself.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.887
Okay, so, here's what I've got.

37:45.304 --> 37:49.392
I'm gonna introduce water right
at the tip directly into the stream.

37:49.976 --> 37:53.604
Okay, this is cryogun instant freeze.

37:53.688 --> 37:58.150
That way I should be able to form a very
thick layer of ice around my target...

37:58.234 --> 38:00.361
In three, two, one.

38:00.444 --> 38:02.029
...freezing him in his tracks.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.466
That's one frozen Ribeye.

38:24.552 --> 38:26.470
My superpower is complete.

38:27.054 --> 38:29.390
[cackling]

38:31.559 --> 38:34.812
I'm a little worried about you.
You're like a regular mad scientist.

38:34.895 --> 38:36.355
Thank you very much.

38:36.439 --> 38:38.983
All right, so, how close
to a real superpower?

38:39.066 --> 38:41.736
I mean, it's not exactly instantaneous.

38:41.819 --> 38:43.195
No, but it does freeze.

38:43.779 --> 38:47.450
If you sneak up on a superhero asleep,
maybe you can get them.

38:47.533 --> 38:49.285
Or if they're, like, really slow.

38:49.368 --> 38:50.995
Oh, come on, Slothman.

38:51.078 --> 38:52.455
Captain Statue.

38:52.538 --> 38:54.749
-I would kick their butts.
-[Tory chuckles]

38:54.832 --> 38:58.753
All right, usability.
I mean, that tank isn't the most portable,

38:58.836 --> 39:01.005
and your superhero
basically has to stand still.

39:01.088 --> 39:02.340
Yeah, all right.

39:02.965 --> 39:05.384
I'll concede it's a three out of ten
for usability.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.595
All right, so how much did it cost?

39:07.678 --> 39:09.221
Ah-ha! This is where I got you.

39:09.805 --> 39:14.101
Five-twenty for liquid nitrogen,
650 for the 40 gallon tank,

39:14.185 --> 39:17.772
$300 for valves and hoses,
$5 for minions.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.566
$5 for minions.
That's not even minimum wage!

39:20.649 --> 39:23.319
They got a union.
They have excellent health benefits.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.779
You are a super-villain.

39:24.862 --> 39:28.032
So, I'm guessing the costume was free
because you probably own that.

39:28.115 --> 39:30.910
-Uh, Yeah.
-Okay. That's what I thought.

39:34.205 --> 39:38.250
Now, when it comes to superpowers,
what's the most powerful? My choice:

39:40.044 --> 39:41.253
Superhuman strength.

39:41.337 --> 39:44.673
Enough to stop a runaway train,
or lift a burning car.

39:45.466 --> 39:46.926
And for over a century,

39:47.009 --> 39:49.011
scientists have been working
on a technology

39:49.095 --> 39:51.847
that aims to make
that kind of thing possible:

39:52.390 --> 39:53.516
The exoskeleton.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.228
These patent drawings are from 1890.

39:57.436 --> 40:02.400
Russian inventor Nicholas Yagin conceived
of a compressed-air powered facilitator

40:02.483 --> 40:06.404
for walking, running and jumping
more than 120 years ago.

40:06.946 --> 40:08.739
Fast-forward to 1960s...

40:09.573 --> 40:13.202
and manufacturing techniques
caught up to his futuristic design.

40:13.869 --> 40:14.995
This is the Hardiman.

40:15.579 --> 40:18.874
General Electric's hydraulic suit was
supposed to enable you

40:18.958 --> 40:20.126
to lift 1,500 pounds.

40:21.710 --> 40:23.546
But it had a dark side.

40:23.629 --> 40:26.257
Violent bouts of out-of-control motion

40:26.340 --> 40:30.261
that meant no one dare switch it on
with a real person inside.

40:32.304 --> 40:34.932
Which is probably for the best.
But it was a start.

40:37.059 --> 40:39.520
Today, technology has come a long way.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.689
The ReWalk, for instance,

40:41.772 --> 40:44.692
is totally transforming the lives
of paraplegics.

40:46.277 --> 40:50.739
While other partial exoskeletons,
including the Panasonic Assist Robots,

40:50.823 --> 40:52.908
reduce the strain of heavy lifting.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.619
But to really be a superhero,

40:55.703 --> 40:59.623
I need something that can give
super strength to my whole body.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.836
What would you say is the most
advanced exoskeleton today?

41:03.919 --> 41:06.547
The XOS 2 is one of the most impressive.

41:06.630 --> 41:09.675
This was a research project
funded by DARPA in the U.S.

41:10.551 --> 41:12.428
It provides support to the entire body.

41:15.139 --> 41:18.267
[Tory] Meanwhile in Japan,
the Panasonic Power Loader

41:18.350 --> 41:21.687
is over 5 feet tall, has 7-foot-long arms,

41:21.770 --> 41:26.775
and allows an ordinary person
to effortlessly lift 220 pounds,

41:26.859 --> 41:28.319
the weight of a large aardvark.

41:29.528 --> 41:32.990
But there's a few reasons why
these aren't quite superhero suits yet.

41:34.158 --> 41:38.704
First, the more power you want,
the bigger the power source needs to be,

41:38.787 --> 41:41.248
making portability a huge issue.

41:43.709 --> 41:47.630
Then there's the huge challenge
of perfectly mimicking human movement.

41:49.298 --> 41:51.467
So, it's no surprise
that no one's been able

41:51.550 --> 41:54.220
to bring a full-body exoskeleton
to market.

41:54.929 --> 41:57.348
[Marc] All that's stopping us
are technological barriers.

41:57.973 --> 42:00.267
But these technologies
are advancing all the time,

42:00.351 --> 42:03.145
so, it's not really a matter of if,
but more when.

42:04.647 --> 42:08.192
[Tory] They're likely to be pricey.
Not good news for criteria one.

42:08.943 --> 42:13.822
They do offer super strength,
but only under controlled circumstances.

42:15.616 --> 42:18.619
And usability won't
break any records either.

42:19.912 --> 42:21.705
Well, the tech is on its way,

42:21.789 --> 42:25.501
but I'm gonna have to wait a while
until I get a suit like Iron Man.

42:25.584 --> 42:26.460
Damn it.

42:29.421 --> 42:33.717
[Kari] Back at the restaurant,
I only got Tory to down a few Merlots...

42:33.801 --> 42:34.677
So good.

42:34.760 --> 42:37.012
[laughing]

42:37.096 --> 42:39.014
before we hit a technical glitch.

42:39.098 --> 42:40.140
Is there a kill switch?

42:40.224 --> 42:42.726
[groaning]

42:43.769 --> 42:47.106
[Kari] Now that my mind-control pixies
have ironed out the wrinkles...

42:47.690 --> 42:50.359
I'm ready to take this superpower
for a real run.

42:51.443 --> 42:53.612
Food. Yay!

42:54.196 --> 42:55.739
Bring on the first course.

42:56.365 --> 42:57.616
Spaghetti and meatballs
are my favorite.

42:58.284 --> 43:01.954
[laughing]

43:02.037 --> 43:03.622
Can I get some more silverware?

43:04.123 --> 43:05.916
You've got a fork right there.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.376
I'm not using my fork.

43:07.459 --> 43:09.461
I will literally stab myself in the face.

43:10.296 --> 43:12.673
-I'm not stupid.
-Okay.

43:22.808 --> 43:24.977
Why is this so fun for me?

43:26.770 --> 43:29.481
[yelps, then laughing]

43:31.942 --> 43:33.110
Oh, and there's pizza.

43:33.777 --> 43:36.113
Ooh. That looks delicious.

43:38.657 --> 43:42.077
Take a bite. I'm good. Eat some food,
find out what happens. Try the food.

43:48.667 --> 43:50.586
Can you hand me another napkin?

43:54.298 --> 43:56.467
Will I or won't I? Will I or won't I?

43:59.803 --> 44:01.180
I would like some more wine.

44:03.515 --> 44:05.142
Oh, look what's happening.

44:08.020 --> 44:09.688
As much fun as this has been...

44:10.189 --> 44:12.691
I love my job so much!

44:12.900 --> 44:13.901
[sighs]

44:13.984 --> 44:16.862
...we're here to rate
this mind-control superpower...

44:19.281 --> 44:21.492
on its three key criteria.

44:21.575 --> 44:24.244
So... is this a superpower?

44:24.828 --> 44:26.705
I said pour me wine!

44:26.789 --> 44:29.249
It's a good beginning
for maybe a super-villain.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.253
I am drunk with power!

44:33.337 --> 44:34.713
It's cost efficient.

44:34.797 --> 44:36.340
[yells]

44:37.508 --> 44:39.385
Usability? It's portable.

44:39.468 --> 44:42.846
And once you're wired up
it's easy to control your human puppet.

44:42.930 --> 44:43.889
[yells]

44:43.972 --> 44:44.932
I punched myself.

44:45.015 --> 44:48.644
Maybe not a superpower,
or full mind control...

44:48.727 --> 44:51.939
but still... kind of the best day
of my career.

44:52.523 --> 44:55.067
How you doing?
Are you feeling better about this?

44:56.026 --> 44:57.986
Oh, he's not even talking to me anymore.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.324
That was amazing! How did it feel?

45:02.825 --> 45:03.784
Oh, it sucked.

45:03.867 --> 45:05.369
Actually, I was talking to Kari.

45:05.452 --> 45:08.831
-I love my little Tory puppet.
-Oh, you're so cruel.

45:08.914 --> 45:12.000
No, but seriously,
what did it feel like when it locked up?

45:12.584 --> 45:14.753
There was no faking.
It was 100 percent working

45:14.837 --> 45:18.048
-and it 100% hurt.
-And it was 100% hilarious.

45:18.132 --> 45:20.592
Okay, time for us
to average all our criteria

45:20.676 --> 45:22.469
and come up with the final list.

45:24.388 --> 45:28.100
In our quest to find technology
that gives mere mortals superpowers,

45:28.183 --> 45:31.061
we've tested everything
from controlling lightning...

45:31.145 --> 45:34.148
[Tory] Ninjas, I'm about to light you up
like Christmas trees.

45:34.648 --> 45:36.024
to controlling minds.

45:36.108 --> 45:38.652
I love my job so much!

45:38.735 --> 45:41.780
[Grant] We've scored our tech contenders
using three criteria:

45:42.406 --> 45:46.368
Cost, similarity to the real superpower,
and usability.

45:46.452 --> 45:47.828
Here's how they ranked.

45:47.911 --> 45:50.289
At number six, exoskeleton.

45:50.372 --> 45:52.708
We're still a long way
from Tony Stark's suit,

45:52.791 --> 45:56.044
and this emerging Iron Man tech
comes with a high price tag.

45:57.254 --> 46:00.174
Coming in at number five, invisibility.

46:00.799 --> 46:03.093
It only costs $200, but...

46:03.677 --> 46:06.472
we just couldn't see
this superpower winning.

46:08.891 --> 46:11.894
At number four overall... Jetman.

46:12.519 --> 46:15.314
Similarity to superpower
comes in second...

46:15.814 --> 46:20.444
but loses points for cost at $190,000.

46:23.363 --> 46:26.700
Our number three superpower tech, Dr. Ice.

46:26.992 --> 46:30.454
At just under $1500,
definitely affordable.

46:31.121 --> 46:34.833
But as far as usability,
your nemesis shouldn't be too worried.

46:36.919 --> 46:38.962
At number two overall, Captain Megawatt.

46:39.046 --> 46:40.130
[Tory] Ninja, die!

46:40.839 --> 46:44.134
[Grant] Expensive to build
at just over 130 grand...

46:44.635 --> 46:47.137
but this tech delivered
with controllable lightning

46:47.221 --> 46:49.306
deadly to our ninja bad guys.

46:49.806 --> 46:52.142
And at number one, mind control.

46:52.726 --> 46:54.144
What the [bleep]?

46:54.478 --> 46:55.521
Why?

46:56.188 --> 46:57.314
[Grant] It's totally affordable.

46:58.315 --> 47:01.485
Gets five out of ten for similarity
to the real superpower...

47:02.736 --> 47:05.155
and beats out all the other tech
for usability.

47:06.865 --> 47:09.952
And that's how our superpower
tech contenders stacked up.

47:10.452 --> 47:12.663
-What?
-Mind control!

47:12.746 --> 47:14.831
Mind control? How did that win?

47:14.915 --> 47:18.585
I mean, you have to actually
stick the electrodes on the person's body.

47:18.669 --> 47:20.128
How do you get them to do that?

47:20.212 --> 47:23.006
Trusting me is my superpower.

47:23.090 --> 47:23.966
[groans]
