00:27.651 --> 00:29.151
Whoo! Yeah!

00:32.990 --> 00:35.424
You wanna smoke?

00:35.492 --> 00:37.059
Oh.

00:37.127 --> 00:39.094
No, I'm... I'm okay.

00:39.163 --> 00:41.696
Is this your place?

00:41.765 --> 00:43.231
You don't smoke?

00:43.300 --> 00:45.133
No, I'm good with my beer.

00:45.202 --> 00:47.135
I like to drink.

00:47.204 --> 00:50.572
I like to drink, too,
Do you like the space?

00:50.641 --> 00:53.141
Oh, yeah. Are you kidding me?

00:53.210 --> 00:55.777
It's amazing. It's so cool.

00:55.846 --> 00:57.312
God, you're adorable.

00:57.381 --> 00:59.214
I'm...

00:59.283 --> 01:01.349
You an artist?

01:01.418 --> 01:05.019
Oh, no. I'm just an art lover.

01:05.089 --> 01:10.725
Ah! Well, I'm a lover of art lovers.

01:10.794 --> 01:13.361
Does that count at all, or...

01:13.430 --> 01:15.097
Mm-hmm.

01:15.165 --> 01:17.332
Those are my sculptures there in the front.

01:18.969 --> 01:21.503
Really? I love them.

01:21.572 --> 01:23.905
The lady torso things?

01:23.974 --> 01:25.407
They're so beautiful.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.442
It's bullshit, but it sells.

01:27.511 --> 01:28.844
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:28.912 --> 01:29.845
Hi.

01:29.913 --> 01:31.880
Hi there.

01:33.584 --> 01:34.916
Oh.

01:34.985 --> 01:36.918
Hey, I want you to meet my friend Roscoe.

01:36.987 --> 01:38.553
Okay, baby.

01:40.557 --> 01:41.790
Nice to meet you.

01:41.859 --> 01:43.792
No... Very nice. Yes.

01:43.861 --> 01:46.094
- Enjoy the beer.
- I am.

01:46.163 --> 01:47.529
- Uh-huh.
- Come on.
- Thank you.

01:51.802 --> 01:52.834
Yeah.

01:54.304 --> 01:57.038
Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles.

01:58.408 --> 02:00.342
All right, well...

02:03.113 --> 02:05.046
Okay, that's fine.

02:07.284 --> 02:08.717
That's fine.

02:18.362 --> 02:20.262
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:20.330 --> 02:22.531
What happened?

02:24.434 --> 02:27.002
Did you tell his wife that you're gay?

02:27.070 --> 02:29.671
- I don't think I had to.
- Mm-hmm.

02:29.740 --> 02:32.641
Meanwhile, in other news,

02:32.709 --> 02:34.809
I just got cock-blocked by my daughter.

02:37.347 --> 02:38.847
Huh. You wanna get out of here?

02:38.916 --> 02:39.781
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:39.850 --> 02:40.982
Yeah.

02:43.487 --> 02:45.387
Don't like those.

02:45.455 --> 02:46.922
Love your work.

02:49.293 --> 02:51.193
Come on, now.

02:51.261 --> 02:52.961
Look, I'm finally getting some titty.

02:54.731 --> 02:58.033
Remember when Paul
McCartney married that...

02:58.101 --> 03:02.270
that teenage one-legged
model for five minutes?

03:02.339 --> 03:06.241
And for that, she got to
keep all his Beatles money?

03:06.310 --> 03:10.445
Like, just because he wanted to shtupp her,

03:10.514 --> 03:13.281
she got to keep half of his genius money.

03:13.350 --> 03:15.784
And then he married a
lady 10 years younger,

03:15.852 --> 03:17.485
and everybody was like,

03:17.554 --> 03:20.155
"Eww! What does he have,
like, an old-lady fetish?"

03:24.528 --> 03:28.296
- Asshole, wake up.
- What?

03:28.365 --> 03:31.433
You're sleeping. I'm
pouring my heart out to you.

03:31.501 --> 03:34.035
You were? What did I miss?

03:36.006 --> 03:38.039
I can't believe how old we are.

03:38.108 --> 03:39.874
I can't believe how good we look.

03:41.478 --> 03:44.079
It's so crazy.

03:44.147 --> 03:47.315
It's like, right now, it just feels like

03:47.384 --> 03:49.751
50th birthday parties,

03:49.820 --> 03:52.454
gay weddings, and funerals.

03:52.522 --> 03:55.757
I mean...

03:55.826 --> 03:59.961
I used to think the scary part
about getting older was dying,

04:00.030 --> 04:02.931
and it turns out that the
scary part of getting older

04:03.000 --> 04:04.266
is young people.

04:04.334 --> 04:07.669
It's like we're the Indians,

04:07.738 --> 04:09.771
and they're the white settlers,

04:09.840 --> 04:13.074
and they keep coming and
they take all our resources,

04:13.143 --> 04:16.678
and all we're left with
is diseased blankets.

04:19.616 --> 04:20.915
I'm afraid of dying.

04:22.853 --> 04:23.752
You are?

04:27.624 --> 04:29.457
Have another Ruby Red, Ed.

04:29.526 --> 04:31.092
Yes, Pats.

04:35.599 --> 04:38.033
Honey...

04:38.101 --> 04:40.368
you need to start writing.

04:40.437 --> 04:42.704
When are you gonna write a book?

04:42.773 --> 04:45.440
I know. I got a hundred
things I have to do.

04:45.509 --> 04:47.909
I have to hurry up and get gay
married so I can get gay divorced

04:47.978 --> 04:49.477
and then gay retire.

04:49.546 --> 04:51.813
I want to get gay married.

04:51.882 --> 04:55.383
You are... to me.

04:58.255 --> 04:59.321
Let me have a cigarette.

04:59.389 --> 05:00.955
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

05:01.024 --> 05:03.325
- Being bad.
- Mm-hmm.

05:30.821 --> 05:33.555
- Come on, I wanna see.
- No, Mom.

05:35.058 --> 05:36.591
- Did you like it?
- No.

05:36.660 --> 05:38.927
- Wait, can I have it, since you don't like it?
- No!

05:38.995 --> 05:41.296
- Uh!
- God!

05:41.365 --> 05:43.231
Come on, Max, I wanna see.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.200
I'm trying it! Stop knocking.

05:45.268 --> 05:47.102
Hey, Siri, what's the difference between

05:47.170 --> 05:49.337
the white man's burden
and the black man's burden?

05:49.406 --> 05:52.040
<i>Here's what I found on the Web for</i>

05:52.109 --> 05:54.109
<i>what's the difference between the white
man's burden and the black man's burden.</i>

05:54.177 --> 05:57.412
Max, come on, already. I wanna see.

05:57.481 --> 06:00.515
It's fine. You don't need to
see, you just need to buy it.

06:00.584 --> 06:03.885
[Foreign word], it is so sweet
that you have three girls.

06:03.954 --> 06:07.288
- Angels.
- Thank you.

06:07.357 --> 06:08.656
You're welcome.

06:08.725 --> 06:10.725
Fake.

06:10.794 --> 06:11.593
Fake.

06:14.331 --> 06:16.030
Ladies, please enjoy the course.

06:16.099 --> 06:17.899
Thank you, Chef Daria.

06:17.968 --> 06:20.535
Very nice. Very, very young.

06:20.604 --> 06:22.837
- Not illegal.
- Really cute.

06:22.906 --> 06:25.106
- Joy, smell this.
- Yeah, it's great.

06:25.175 --> 06:26.975
- No, it's okay. Get in there.
- It's fine.

06:27.043 --> 06:28.576
- I can't really smell things.
- Sam, she has allergies.

06:28.645 --> 06:30.345
No, it's from my brain surgery.

06:30.414 --> 06:33.148
- Oh, shit. I'm sorry, I forgot.
- Yeah.

06:33.216 --> 06:34.849
- I'm sorry, you had brain surgery?
- Mmm.

06:34.918 --> 06:36.951
Yes, she had brain surgery.

06:37.020 --> 06:40.021
I mean, they cut her head open, and
she was at work, like, a month later.

06:40.090 --> 06:43.591
It's fine, okay? It
wasn't cancer or anything.

06:43.660 --> 06:46.461
It was right in the front.
Really easy to take out.

06:46.530 --> 06:47.996
Someone even said, "This is, like,

06:48.064 --> 06:50.298
the best possible brain tumor"

06:50.367 --> 06:51.966
And I'm not bragging.

06:52.035 --> 06:53.334
You know what? They didn't
even have to shave my head.

06:53.403 --> 06:55.370
What they did is, like,

06:55.439 --> 06:56.805
they sucked it out through
my nose with, like, a straw...

06:56.873 --> 06:58.673
like, a medical straw.

06:58.742 --> 07:01.276
Did you think you were
gonna die or anything?

07:01.344 --> 07:03.511
No, not really. Not, like, seriously.

07:03.580 --> 07:06.181
- Not even when they first told you?
- No.

07:06.249 --> 07:09.717
It was my ear, nose, and
throat doctor who found it.

07:09.786 --> 07:11.352
When he called me, he was like,

07:11.421 --> 07:13.621
"There's this thing on your MRI.

07:13.690 --> 07:15.757
95% of the time, they're benign.

07:15.826 --> 07:17.792
I'm gonna put you together
with a brain surgeon."

07:17.861 --> 07:20.295
Actually, he just texted me earlier...

07:20.363 --> 07:22.430
the brain surgeon.

07:22.499 --> 07:23.965
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

07:24.034 --> 07:25.900
I guess we're sort of friends now.

07:25.969 --> 07:28.069
He wants me to set him up with someone.

07:28.138 --> 07:31.372
It does seem fast to be back on your feet

07:31.441 --> 07:33.475
after brain surgery.

07:33.543 --> 07:34.976
Right. Yeah, that's what I think.

07:35.045 --> 07:37.879
Wait. Your brain surgeon

07:37.948 --> 07:41.649
just texted you to hook him up?

07:41.718 --> 07:43.651
That's weird, right?

07:43.720 --> 07:45.854
And I don't wanna set
people up anymore, okay?

07:45.922 --> 07:48.223
- I hate it.
- Why doesn't he just date you?

07:48.291 --> 07:50.758
I mean, you're single.

07:50.827 --> 07:53.194
What's your problem? What are you doing?

07:55.899 --> 07:57.265
What?

08:04.341 --> 08:08.510
Oh, my God. Jeff's on Tinder?

08:08.578 --> 08:11.946
What? Oh, no. Oh, shoot. I'm sorry.

08:12.015 --> 08:14.516
- That's shit.
- You husband is on Tinder?

08:14.584 --> 08:17.252
- Joy, no offense. Don't comment.
- Sorry.

08:21.258 --> 08:23.691
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Jeff.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.460
- No, don't! Don't!
- No!

08:25.529 --> 08:27.395
Enough with this shit, Sunny!

08:48.652 --> 08:50.351
Honey, I can't.

08:52.355 --> 08:55.490
You can't... It's my life.

08:55.559 --> 08:59.327
It's hard to watch. I love you.

08:59.396 --> 09:02.764
You think it's harder to watch
than it is to be living it?

09:02.832 --> 09:05.567
Yeah, it might be.

09:05.635 --> 09:09.337
That's just mean.

09:09.406 --> 09:11.839
I know.

09:11.908 --> 09:15.843
And that's all I have for you right now.

09:15.912 --> 09:17.011
I don't know know what to say.

09:17.080 --> 09:20.248
Jesus Christ, I hate him so much.

09:20.317 --> 09:22.483
I just feel like...

09:22.552 --> 09:25.553
Okay, you got out of yours. But I...

09:25.622 --> 09:28.189
Not everybody's ready when
you want them to be ready.

09:30.060 --> 09:31.793
You're right.

09:34.664 --> 09:37.432
Sorry. I'm really...

09:37.500 --> 09:39.801
I'm sorry.

09:39.869 --> 09:41.235
Sorry.

09:52.373 --> 09:54.206
Lunches are ready!

09:57.144 --> 09:59.912
- Thanks, Mom.
- You got it.

09:59.980 --> 10:02.447
Jessie come get your lunch.

10:02.516 --> 10:05.417
I don't eat lunch.

10:05.486 --> 10:06.919
Honey, you're growing.

10:06.987 --> 10:09.254
And please stop, by the way.

10:09.323 --> 10:11.256
Good morning, family.

10:14.161 --> 10:16.061
I'm so excited to start another day.

10:16.130 --> 10:18.831
- I'm not.
- He won't eat his lunch.

10:18.899 --> 10:21.366
That's my boy. You don't eat your lunch.

10:21.435 --> 10:23.302
You eat the other guy's lunch, am I right?

10:23.370 --> 10:26.438
- Yeah. Whatever, Dad.
- That's my boy again.

10:26.507 --> 10:27.840
Don't listen to anyone over 30.

10:29.877 --> 10:33.779
And cut.

10:33.848 --> 10:35.581
It needs something funnier there.

10:35.649 --> 10:38.750
Well, we need to take a
break, but we'll work on it.

10:38.819 --> 10:41.086
Okay.

10:41.155 --> 10:43.989
- Sammy, great as always.
- Okay, Greg.

10:55.536 --> 10:57.169
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:57.238 --> 10:59.104
Will you run the next scene with me?

10:59.173 --> 11:00.973
Oh, sure.

11:01.041 --> 11:05.110
Come on, I'm just
finishing up some kid shit.

11:05.179 --> 11:06.245
Okay.

11:08.983 --> 11:11.049
So you're a real mom, huh?

11:11.118 --> 11:13.785
Yes, sir, I am.

11:13.854 --> 11:15.721
Wow.

11:15.789 --> 11:19.291
It's so weird you're playing my mom.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.792
Why?

11:20.861 --> 11:22.794
Well, because you're hot.

11:22.863 --> 11:25.664
I'd hook up with you.

11:32.406 --> 11:34.039
Which scene do you wanna run?

11:34.108 --> 11:35.941
Uh, the first one we're doing today.

11:36.010 --> 11:37.743
It's 2A.

11:37.811 --> 11:40.178
Okay.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.317
This is a nightmare.

11:45.386 --> 11:47.619
- Are they keeping the audience?
- I think we're letting them go.

11:47.688 --> 11:49.521
- Oy.
- Please.

11:49.590 --> 11:51.523
You know how many pilots I've
shot never made it to broadcast?

11:51.592 --> 11:53.158
I don't even care anymore.

11:53.227 --> 11:55.027
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

11:55.095 --> 11:56.962
You are hilarious, by the way.

11:57.031 --> 11:58.163
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

11:58.232 --> 11:59.298
You, too.

11:59.366 --> 12:01.233
And you're a hottie. Mmm!

12:01.302 --> 12:03.168
Slap a pair of tits on
you, you'd be just my type.

12:03.237 --> 12:05.203
Ha! Yeah.

12:05.272 --> 12:06.905
Must be easier for you, though, right?

12:06.974 --> 12:09.341
I mean, you come in, you do a day's work,

12:09.410 --> 12:10.642
get to move on.

12:10.711 --> 12:12.477
Me, it's just...

12:12.546 --> 12:15.347
the pressure, you know, of being the guy.

12:15.416 --> 12:17.549
- It's my show.
- Yeah.

12:17.618 --> 12:19.785
Everything's on me, so...

12:19.853 --> 12:21.653
Yeah, I feel you.

12:21.722 --> 12:24.756
I mean, I had four failed
pilots by the time I was 13.

12:24.825 --> 12:27.025
- Oh, shit. That's brutal.
- Yeah.

12:27.094 --> 12:29.294
Glad I didn't start young.

12:29.363 --> 12:32.030
They're firing that Jessie kid, by the way.

12:32.099 --> 12:34.132
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

12:34.201 --> 12:36.234
Happening right over
there, you wanna watch.

12:38.005 --> 12:48.780
- Oh, shit.
- Mm-hmm.

12:48.849 --> 12:51.683
- Hi, Jessie.
- Hi, Sam.

12:51.752 --> 12:53.585
Buddy...

12:53.654 --> 12:57.222
It's humiliating.

12:57.291 --> 12:59.725
I know. Listen, you can't cry.

12:59.793 --> 13:01.626
You just can't cry.

13:01.695 --> 13:04.296
You're never gonna make it
unless you learn how to be fired.

13:07.401 --> 13:10.402
- Can you drive me home?
- Oh.

13:10.471 --> 13:13.338
My friend drove me. I don't have a car.

13:13.407 --> 13:15.173
I don't think I can
even afford to live now.

13:15.242 --> 13:17.642
Okay. Yeah.

13:17.711 --> 13:19.578
Yeah, yeah, of course.

13:19.646 --> 13:20.946
Of course. Come on.

13:21.015 --> 13:21.947
Okay.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.955
Just keep taking your
classes and keep trying.

13:30.024 --> 13:31.857
Don't give up. You chose to be an actor.

13:31.925 --> 13:34.593
- It's not easy.
- Yeah.

13:34.661 --> 13:37.429
- You're being so cool.
- That's okay.

13:39.533 --> 13:41.266
Can I say something kind of weird?

13:41.335 --> 13:44.770
Uh, what? Yeah.

13:44.838 --> 13:46.571
I'm totally hard right now.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.507
Oh, shit, dude.

13:48.575 --> 13:50.042
I'm sorry. It's just...

13:50.110 --> 13:52.177
You really make me feel
crazy. I have such a boner.

13:52.246 --> 13:53.378
- Can I take it out?
- No, no.

13:53.447 --> 13:54.980
- Please?
- No, no!

13:55.049 --> 13:57.282
- I have to. I gotta take it out.
- Stop it! Get out!

13:57.351 --> 13:59.718
- Keep the jacket.
- Don't tell anybody.

14:01.121 --> 14:03.155
Oh, Jesus!

14:16.262 --> 14:19.396
Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

14:19.465 --> 14:21.332
It's okay.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.601
Did you order?

14:23.669 --> 14:25.402
- Yeah.
- Mmm-kay.

14:25.471 --> 14:27.171
- Hey.
- Hello.

14:27.240 --> 14:29.373
I'll just have some beets. The beets.

14:29.442 --> 14:31.208
- Great
- Thanks.

14:32.879 --> 14:35.546
So how are you?

14:35.615 --> 14:37.681
Uh, I'm doing well. Yeah.

14:37.750 --> 14:40.251
Good. Good.

14:40.319 --> 14:42.319
You look well.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.191
How are the girls?

14:47.260 --> 14:50.728
Oh, they're, um...

14:50.797 --> 14:52.429
Everything okay?

14:52.498 --> 14:56.033
Yes, Zander, everything's fine.

14:56.102 --> 14:57.935
You're daughters are fine. You're fine.

15:02.041 --> 15:05.109
It's been a long day. I just shouldn't...

15:05.178 --> 15:07.311
There's just something I
wanted to discuss with you.

15:07.380 --> 15:09.380
Okay.

15:09.448 --> 15:12.750
Um, and I'm gonna ask you...

15:12.819 --> 15:16.086
before I begin, to keep an open mind.

15:16.155 --> 15:19.757
Okay. Yes. My mind is open.

15:19.826 --> 15:22.693
It's completely open. I can't wait.

15:25.031 --> 15:28.365
Um, I'm putting a project together,

15:28.434 --> 15:30.935
which means I'm gonna be in
town for the whole summer.

15:31.003 --> 15:32.803
Okay.

15:32.872 --> 15:35.739
And I'm looking at a place in the Valley

15:35.808 --> 15:39.243
not far from our house...

15:39.312 --> 15:41.912
from the girls' home...

15:41.981 --> 15:42.780
your home.

15:44.684 --> 15:46.917
Mm-hmm.

15:46.986 --> 15:49.520
I just thought maybe we could talk about

15:49.589 --> 15:51.655
how the summer would go.

15:51.724 --> 15:54.959
Oh, well, if you wanna spend time

15:55.027 --> 15:57.695
with the girls this
summer, that would be great.

15:57.763 --> 15:59.897
Do you want them for the summer?

15:59.966 --> 16:03.634
There's camps and stuff, but I'm
happy to help you work all that out.

16:03.703 --> 16:06.036
Well, the thing is, um...

16:06.105 --> 16:09.807
This job is going to take up a lot of time.

16:09.876 --> 16:13.644
These people are really depending on me

16:13.713 --> 16:16.146
to shape the whole project.

16:16.215 --> 16:18.716
I mean, really, it's on me.

16:18.784 --> 16:20.718
It's a huge project.

16:20.786 --> 16:23.320
It's actually really exciting.

16:25.358 --> 16:28.525
Okay, so what are you asking me for?

16:28.594 --> 16:33.397
Do you wanna see the girls
this summer, or you don't?

16:33.466 --> 16:34.932
Well, it might be awkward

16:35.001 --> 16:36.901
because I'm gonna be right nearby,

16:36.969 --> 16:38.369
but I'm not gonna have much time.

16:38.437 --> 16:41.171
Okay, I got it.

16:41.240 --> 16:45.876
You want me to help you
make the girls not be upset

16:45.945 --> 16:50.848
that they still won't get to see you,
even though you're gonna be around.

16:50.917 --> 16:54.285
It's a really big opportunity.

16:54.353 --> 16:56.687
Zander, they don't care.

16:56.756 --> 17:00.424
- Hey...
- Yeah, I'm telling you good news here, man.

17:00.493 --> 17:03.093
You don't have to worry about
it. They're living their lives.

17:03.162 --> 17:05.695
I mean, they're happy
if they get to see you,

17:05.765 --> 17:09.867
but they don't expect anything from you.

17:09.935 --> 17:11.301
That's not fair.

17:11.369 --> 17:13.470
You're right, it isn't.

17:15.308 --> 17:16.839
You're always so superior.

17:16.909 --> 17:18.709
Thank you.

17:18.778 --> 17:20.144
Okay.

17:26.652 --> 17:28.919
I just wanna die right now.

17:34.660 --> 17:37.861
You know, I'm not gonna eat these beets.

17:37.930 --> 17:40.364
I'm gonna go.

17:40.433 --> 17:43.467
Okay. Yeah. Great. Thanks for your help.

17:43.536 --> 17:45.569
Thank you for <i>your</i> help.

18:08.939 --> 18:10.705
Mom, Gram.

18:10.774 --> 18:14.442
Gram's home.

18:14.511 --> 18:17.145
Uh!

18:17.214 --> 18:18.446
It'll stop.

18:18.515 --> 18:19.714
She'll get it.

18:28.625 --> 18:31.159
I'll be right back. Watch the stove.

19:02.726 --> 19:04.025
Mom?

19:08.331 --> 19:11.099
Mom?

19:18.308 --> 19:19.574
Yes, hello?

19:19.643 --> 19:21.943
Hi. Hi.

19:22.012 --> 19:23.444
Yes.

19:23.513 --> 19:25.546
Everything's okay.

19:25.615 --> 19:27.949
The password is Tweedledee.

19:28.018 --> 19:29.917
- Yes. Thank you.
- Why is my door open?

19:29.986 --> 19:31.452
- Hi. Mom?
- Hello?

19:31.521 --> 19:33.955
- Mom, hi, I'm here.
- Hello, sweetheart.

19:34.024 --> 19:36.858
Hi. Your alarm was going crazy.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.627
- It was? Oh, dear.
- Yeah.

19:39.696 --> 19:42.830
Yeah. Mom, why do you even set it?

19:42.899 --> 19:45.400
Who's gonna come in here? They'd
be scared of all the piles.

19:45.468 --> 19:48.036
I like it. And it comforts
me. And I like my things.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.838
Okay.

19:50.907 --> 19:52.407
- Mom?
- Hmm?

19:52.475 --> 19:55.777
What if I paid you to clean
off one surface in your house?

19:55.845 --> 19:57.979
- Just one.
- Well, I'll have you know,

19:58.048 --> 19:59.480
I've been weeding out.

19:59.549 --> 20:01.182
I got rid of several papers yesterday,

20:01.251 --> 20:02.884
and I've got a bag in the
garage ready to donate.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.886
Do you want to see the shoes I got today?

20:04.954 --> 20:07.121
If you have a bag ready to donate,

20:07.190 --> 20:09.957
can you give it to me, so I
can get rid of it for you today?

20:10.026 --> 20:11.492
No, sweetheart, I'm adding to it.

20:11.561 --> 20:13.361
I'm not ready for you to take it yet.

20:13.430 --> 20:15.797
- You look so pretty in that color.
- Okay.

20:15.865 --> 20:18.032
You wanna come for dinner? I'm making.

20:18.109 --> 20:21.511
Oh, that would be lovely, but I got bridge.

20:21.579 --> 20:24.247
- Okay. See you.
- Oh, before you go,

20:24.315 --> 20:26.115
can you come have a look at my printer?

20:26.184 --> 20:27.817
Because I'm having a devil of a time

20:27.886 --> 20:29.919
trying to get some
important papers printed out.

20:29.988 --> 20:31.821
- Okay, sure.
- It's just in here.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.959
Phyl, where's your printer?

20:37.028 --> 20:39.228
It's over there, darling. Look, there.

20:40.965 --> 20:43.499
Oh, well, I have to take this off of it.

20:43.568 --> 20:44.901
Yes. Put it over there.

20:51.076 --> 20:53.943
Okay. It wasn't turned on.

20:54.012 --> 20:56.079
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:56.147 --> 20:57.680
Isn't that strange. It was turned on.

20:57.749 --> 21:00.183
You sure you didn't turn it off?

21:01.586 --> 21:03.886
Maybe that's why the alarm went off.

21:03.955 --> 21:07.757
Perhaps somebody was in here
and they turned my printer off.

21:07.826 --> 21:09.450
Okay.

21:09.527 --> 21:12.854
Well, I gotta go. I gotta go.

21:12.922 --> 21:15.665
Um, oh, do you have any vodka?

21:15.734 --> 21:17.867
I always have vodka. It's
in the garage in the freezer.

21:17.936 --> 21:19.368
Okay.

21:19.437 --> 21:22.004
This is very peculiar.

21:33.618 --> 21:37.186
That's called Blue Ice,
and it's very good vodka,

21:37.255 --> 21:38.988
and it's American made, which is important.

21:39.057 --> 21:40.323
I know, I know.

21:42.994 --> 21:45.595
My damn hands.

21:45.663 --> 21:49.165
Oh, God. Did you ask your
doctor if he could get you pot?

21:49.234 --> 21:52.135
Yes, I did, but he said he
couldn't prescribe it to me,

21:52.203 --> 21:53.903
only to cancer patients.

21:53.972 --> 21:55.671
Oh, God.

21:55.740 --> 21:58.633
I'm gonna have Macy get you some.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.835
- All right, dear.
- It's very easy.

22:00.912 --> 22:02.837
But I don't like to smoke it.

22:02.914 --> 22:04.539
I wouldn't mind to eat some of it,

22:04.616 --> 22:06.082
but I don't like the smoking of it.

22:06.142 --> 22:08.818
I was told there was a candy or something.

22:08.887 --> 22:11.521
- Not too sweet.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:11.589 --> 22:13.256
Yeah, they have all that stuff.

22:13.324 --> 22:15.191
I'll get it for you with Macy.

22:15.260 --> 22:18.294
- Okay? Schnapps.
- Okay, dear.

22:18.363 --> 22:21.030
I had jury duty this week.

22:21.099 --> 22:23.766
Believe it or not, I was on a jury.

22:23.835 --> 22:25.401
And it was only a couple of days,

22:25.470 --> 22:27.336
but it was fascinating to me.

22:27.405 --> 22:30.206
My first time called, and I was, you know,

22:30.275 --> 22:32.308
chosen at random to be on the jury.

22:32.377 --> 22:35.011
And they chose me to be the foreperson.

22:38.383 --> 22:41.350
- Okay, well, bye.
- Oh, come.

22:41.419 --> 22:43.619
Mom, please don't touch my hair.

22:43.688 --> 22:45.788
I can't win, Bad girl, bad girl.

22:45.857 --> 22:50.560
Mom. Mom? Can we get rid
of some of these things?

22:50.628 --> 22:52.428
Please. Please.

22:52.489 --> 22:54.889
Don't the piles make you crazy?

22:54.966 --> 22:56.591
Can we get rid of some of the piles?

22:56.668 --> 22:58.067
So you see the piles?

22:58.136 --> 22:59.669
I don't want to talk about it!

22:59.737 --> 23:03.097
Please! It makes me upset.

23:03.174 --> 23:06.475
I've had a very long day, and I just want
to have a little rest before I go out.

23:06.544 --> 23:09.445
Okay. I'm sorry. Okay. Let's go.

23:09.514 --> 23:10.780
We're gonna have dinner. You're coming.

23:10.849 --> 23:12.248
No, I can't, because it's bridge.

23:12.317 --> 23:14.517
No, bridge is tomorrow.

23:14.586 --> 23:16.552
- What's today?
- Today is Tuesday.

23:16.621 --> 23:18.921
- Bridge is Wednesday.
- Oh, so it is.

23:18.990 --> 23:21.157
Okay. Tell me about jury duty.

23:21.226 --> 23:23.860
Well, I thought it was a murderer's case,

23:23.928 --> 23:27.330
because the man in the dark
had eyebrows that met together,

23:27.398 --> 23:29.265
and he had a sort of very grim face.

23:29.334 --> 23:31.934
- Oh, wait.
- So I thought that it was definitely him.

23:32.003 --> 23:36.172
And I said to my fellow jury
people, "Let's convict him."

23:36.241 --> 23:39.976
Because I just wouldn't
have trusted a man like that.

23:40.044 --> 23:43.500
Um, he may have been, you
know, a perfectly nice person.
