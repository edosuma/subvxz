<i>The only thing
I ever knew was cotton.</i>

01:30.133 --> 01:31.426
<i>It was hard work.</i>

01:36.264 --> 01:40.852
Now, you know cotton is ready
when the bud splits,

01:41.019 --> 01:43.104
and the boll is star-shaped,

01:43.271 --> 01:45.940
like a big ol' star in the sky.

01:46.858 --> 01:48.526
Or like your big ol' head.

01:48.693 --> 01:50.570
Hold on, is that some cotton?

01:50.737 --> 01:52.655
Is that cotton?

01:53.782 --> 01:54.866
<i>But I didn't mind, </i>

01:55.033 --> 01:57.410
<i>'cause I got to spend all day
working with my daddy.</i>

01:57.577 --> 02:00.580
- Hurry, take this picture.
- Take a picture of y'all.

02:00.747 --> 02:02.832
Why don't everybody smile?

02:05.710 --> 02:08.045
Teeth.

02:12.467 --> 02:15.553
Hattie, come on,
I need your help in the shed.

02:17.138 --> 02:18.515
Come on.

02:27.315 --> 02:30.527
- Pa... where he taking Ma?
- Get back to work.

02:32.862 --> 02:34.823
Cecil, come back here, boy.

02:36.866 --> 02:38.076
Mama!

02:38.243 --> 02:39.577
Come here.

02:40.119 --> 02:41.454
Look at me, boy.

02:41.621 --> 02:43.706
Don't you lose your temper
with that man.

02:43.873 --> 02:47.085
This his world.
We just living in it.

02:47.252 --> 02:48.586
You hear me?

02:48.753 --> 02:50.547
Now, get on back to work.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.873
Pa, what you gonna do?

03:29.460 --> 03:31.129
Hey.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.728
- Dad!

03:52.817 --> 03:54.444
Oh, my Lord.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.747
Who you looking at?! Huh?

04:05.914 --> 04:09.042
Who wants to go next?!
You get back to work.

04:16.757 --> 04:20.762
Hey, you. Get some of the hands
to help dig a hole for his pa.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.639
Hurry up!

04:29.354 --> 04:32.148
Stop crying.

04:34.859 --> 04:37.403
I'm gonna have you
in the house now.

04:41.574 --> 04:46.204
I'm gonna teach you
how to be a house nigger.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.049
- He's coming.
- Yes'm.

04:58.216 --> 05:00.301
And quiet when you're serving.

05:00.468 --> 05:03.346
I don't even want
to hear you breathe.

05:03.513 --> 05:04.514
Yes, ma'am.

05:04.681 --> 05:07.016
<i>The room should feel
empty when you're in it.</i>

05:13.773 --> 05:18.152
<i>It was much nicer working
in the house than in the field.</i>

05:19.570 --> 05:22.073
Crazy nigger, from the left.

05:27.036 --> 05:29.664
Give me more.

05:37.839 --> 05:39.549
Hmm.

05:58.317 --> 06:03.156
<i>When I got older, I knew
I had to go before he killed me, too.</i>

06:08.953 --> 06:11.414
<i>Part of me was scared to leave.</i>

06:11.998 --> 06:14.333
<i>It was the only world I ever knew.</i>

06:24.302 --> 06:26.304
Ma, I took Pa's watch.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.187
Ma?

06:36.731 --> 06:39.984
Ma, I'm leaving.

06:40.151 --> 06:44.072
<i>My mama never
spoke much after that.</i>

06:44.238 --> 06:46.199
<i>I knew she'd miss me, </i>

06:46.365 --> 06:50.620
<i>but I also knew she wanted me
to leave that place.</i>

06:59.003 --> 07:02.673
<i>And even though
Miss Annabeth never said it, </i>

07:02.840 --> 07:05.384
<i>I knew she'd miss me, too.</i>

07:19.315 --> 07:22.985
<i>I don't think God meant
for people to not have a family.</i>

07:31.035 --> 07:35.289
<i>Outside the cotton fields was even worse
than I thought it would be.</i>

07:37.416 --> 07:41.963
<i>No one would give me a job
nor food nor a place to sleep.</i>

07:50.388 --> 07:53.391
<i>Any white man could kill
any of us at any time</i>

07:53.558 --> 07:56.602
<i>and not be punished for it.</i>

07:56.769 --> 07:59.397
<i>The law wasn't on our side.</i>

08:02.525 --> 08:04.777
<i>The law was against us.</i>

08:11.868 --> 08:14.579
<i>I was hungry all the time.</i>

08:42.899 --> 08:45.484
You know what can happen
to you, son?

08:50.489 --> 08:52.491
Get up.

08:59.290 --> 09:01.417
I said, get up.

09:04.086 --> 09:09.133
I'm gonna have to lie
to the boss man about that window.

09:09.300 --> 09:12.386
The good Lord say
we ain't supposed to lie.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.972
Sorry, sir.

09:16.349 --> 09:18.392
Where's your ma and your pa?

09:18.559 --> 09:21.854
My ma crazy in the head,
and my pa got killed.

09:26.359 --> 09:28.236
I'll make you
some ham sandwiches

09:28.402 --> 09:30.613
and send you on your way.

09:30.780 --> 09:32.490
The boss will be here
in a minute.

09:33.241 --> 09:36.077
Sunday's our busiest morning.

09:37.328 --> 09:41.040
You looking for some help?
I know how to serve.

09:42.083 --> 09:45.711
You done broke our window,
you done stole our food,

09:45.878 --> 09:47.505
and now you asking for a job?

09:47.672 --> 09:50.466
Back in Macon,
I'm a house nigger, a good one.

09:54.220 --> 09:57.098
Don't you ever use that word, son.

09:57.265 --> 09:59.475
That's the white man's word.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.811
It's filled With hate.

10:01.978 --> 10:04.563
Didn't your father
ever teach you any better?

10:09.860 --> 10:12.488
- Slow down.
- Yes, sir.

10:13.281 --> 10:14.573
You got to look through their eyes.

10:16.659 --> 10:18.703
See what it is they want.

10:18.869 --> 10:20.454
- Got it?
- Strokes.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.999
- Yeah, I got it.
- Here.

10:27.878 --> 10:31.090
See what it is they need.

10:32.425 --> 10:34.468
Right this way.

10:35.094 --> 10:36.595
Anticipate.

10:46.230 --> 10:48.190
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ma'am.

10:50.276 --> 10:53.321
Bring a smile to the eyes...

10:53.487 --> 10:55.114
<i>...of your principal.</i>

11:02.330 --> 11:05.082
Perfect. Perfect.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.171
Don't forget to save me them chitlins.

11:10.338 --> 11:13.257
- Why you like chitlins so much?
- 'Cause they're good eating.

11:13.424 --> 11:19.055
The manager of Excelsior, in DC,
he came by yesterday.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.515
He offered me a job as a butler.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.643
He must be paying you
top dollar, huh, boss?

11:25.978 --> 11:27.563
Yeah.

11:28.898 --> 11:31.650
I was thinking about taking it,
but I don't know.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.778
I'm too old to be leaving
North Carolina.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.865
I'm just fine right here.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.786
I told him to hire you.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.705
I'm just now finding my way
around this hotel.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.499
Ain't ready for all them
highfalutin white people,

11:46.665 --> 11:48.250
all their fancy words.

11:48.417 --> 11:52.755
ours,

11:52.922 --> 11:55.925
and the ones that we got
to show the white folks.

11:56.092 --> 11:59.261
Now, to get up in the world,

11:59.428 --> 12:02.807
you have to make
them feel nonthreatened.

12:03.933 --> 12:07.186
Use that, them fancy words
that I've taught you.

12:09.939 --> 12:14.985
White folks up north,
they like some uppity coloreds.

12:17.113 --> 12:19.031
Yeah.

12:19.907 --> 12:24.161
<i>I took that job
up in Washington, DC.</i>

12:24.328 --> 12:29.041
<i>It was the most beautiful hotel
I'd ever seen.</i>

12:34.964 --> 12:36.966
I hope it wasn't
too presumptuous of me

12:37.133 --> 12:39.552
to have prepared a few spirits

12:39.718 --> 12:42.096
after your long journey here
from Buffalo.

12:43.722 --> 12:47.726
The best decision that court ever
made was to slow this whole mess down.

12:47.893 --> 12:52.314
Nigger boys in school with white girls.
Who ever heard of such a thing?

12:52.481 --> 12:54.859
Next thing you know,
they'd be fornicating.

12:55.693 --> 13:00.990
Gentlemen, this here is different.
We could start another Civil War.

13:01.157 --> 13:05.494
Cecil, what do you think about niggers
going to school with white children?

13:05.661 --> 13:08.706
To be honest with you,
Mr. Jenkins,

13:08.873 --> 13:11.250
I tend to not be too concerned

13:11.417 --> 13:14.670
with American or European politics.

13:14.837 --> 13:17.590
Nor should you, Cecil.
They're all criminals.

13:17.756 --> 13:20.426
Earl Warren should be shot
and hanged.

13:20.593 --> 13:25.347
That dumb son-of-a-bitch judge
is trying to integrate our schools.

13:25.514 --> 13:31.020
I think Judge Warren is going to find
that quite challenging.

13:31.187 --> 13:33.647
Damn right, Cecil. Damn right.

13:33.814 --> 13:39.236
<i>Never in my life did I dream
I'd work in a place as fancy as this.</i>

13:40.779 --> 13:43.574
<i>I never dreamed my life
could be so good.</i>

13:52.416 --> 13:56.253
<i>Gloria and I met working
at the Excelsior.</i>

13:56.420 --> 13:58.631
<i>She was a maid at the hotel, </i>

13:58.797 --> 14:01.509
<i>but now her only job
was raising our two boys.</i>

14:05.095 --> 14:08.265
<i>I made sure that they
never laid eyes on a cotton field.</i>

14:11.060 --> 14:15.147
- I got to pee.
- Not today. Don't try that.

14:15.314 --> 14:18.150
- Finish that homework.
- Where Louis at?

14:18.317 --> 14:20.945
- He's taking the trash out.
- Working late again?

14:21.111 --> 14:24.031
- How was your shift?
- Beats working for a living.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.493
I miss you at night, honey.

14:31.288 --> 14:34.291
Didn't you say you got to pee?
Go on, then.

14:34.458 --> 14:37.002
Wash your hands when you come
out of that bathroom, boy.

14:39.255 --> 14:41.507
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

14:41.674 --> 14:42.883
Good morning, sir.

14:43.050 --> 14:46.637
Mm-hm.

14:47.763 --> 14:50.933
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Louis.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.894
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

14:54.061 --> 14:57.231
- Good.
- That woman whose son got killed,

14:57.398 --> 15:00.901
she's around doing speeches now.
What's her name, honey?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.279
- Mamie Till.
- Mamie...

15:03.445 --> 15:05.781
Mamie Till. Mm.

15:05.948 --> 15:09.034
I remember that story just
like it was yesterday,

15:09.201 --> 15:11.537
even though it was three years ago.

15:11.704 --> 15:14.957
It was a dis-damn-grace
what they did to that boy.

15:15.124 --> 15:17.084
Just for looking at a white woman.

15:17.251 --> 15:19.670
Beat him up,

15:19.837 --> 15:23.799
threw his body in the river,
killed him.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.802
He wasn't no older than Louis.
He was 14 at the time.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.805
- Crazy white folks down South.
- Thanks, Ma.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.974
At least we got it
a little better in DC, huh?

15:32.141 --> 15:34.560
Still treating us bad, too.

15:34.727 --> 15:37.062
Get on down here, Charlie!
Wash your hands.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.981
Louis said we should stop
taking the white man's shit.

15:39.148 --> 15:40.274
- Hey.
- Shut up.

15:40.441 --> 15:42.067
- Watch your mouth.
- Watch your mouth.

15:42.234 --> 15:45.529
Hello, Gaines' residence.

15:46.822 --> 15:48.741
Uh, yeah. Hold on, Mr. Kidgan.

15:49.867 --> 15:52.870
- It's the boss man, Dad.
- What's he calling for?

15:53.037 --> 15:57.583
<i>When the white man call,
I always assume the worst.</i>

15:57.750 --> 15:59.168
Yes, sir?

15:59.335 --> 16:01.086
<i>I would have put money on it</i>

16:01.253 --> 16:04.506
<i>that I was getting laid off
or something that day.</i>

16:31.617 --> 16:33.994
- Would you follow me, please?
- Yes, sir.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.754
I'm Cecil Gaines.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.714
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- You, as well.

16:45.881 --> 16:47.800
Have a seat.

17:02.231 --> 17:03.691
Are you political, Mr. Gaines?

17:03.857 --> 17:05.983
- No, sir.
- Good.

17:06.151 --> 17:11.406
We have no tolerance
for politics at the White House.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.492
- How'd you find me?
- I didn't.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.538
You served R.D. Warner
at the Excelsior Hotel.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.207
He oversees operations
for the entire White House.

17:20.374 --> 17:23.377
- You made quite an impression.
- I don't recall.

17:23.544 --> 17:27.923
Mr. Warner and myself make note
of potential staff around town.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.008
Butler positions rarely open,

17:30.175 --> 17:31.802
as most stay on for 30 years or more.

17:31.969 --> 17:34.513
I know I was quite surprised
when I got the call.

17:39.852 --> 17:42.104
It was a surprise
for me, as well.

17:42.271 --> 17:46.525
As the White House maître d',
I normally hire the butler.

17:49.153 --> 17:51.572
Forgive me for saying this,
Mr. Fallows.

17:51.739 --> 17:54.491
I certainly wouldn't want to
be hired under circumstances

17:54.658 --> 17:57.369
that would make you
feel uncomfortable.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.247
Oh, really?

18:00.414 --> 18:02.833
You need butlers
that you've handpicked,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.753
men to your liking
that will fulfill your vision

18:05.919 --> 18:07.880
of a proper White House staff.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.467
Hmm.

18:25.939 --> 18:29.067
Is that... Louis XIII?

18:30.152 --> 18:31.904
These decanters are replicas

18:32.070 --> 18:38.452
of metal flasks that were found
on the battlefield in Jarnac.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.537
Correct?

18:40.704 --> 18:42.748
The Italians, they
know their wines,

18:42.915 --> 18:46.668
and the Irish, they certainly know
how to make a great whiskey.

18:46.835 --> 18:50.964
But I believe the French
have a distinct advantage

18:51.131 --> 18:53.926
when it comes to Cognac.

18:56.053 --> 18:57.554
<i>C'est vrai?</i>

19:00.265 --> 19:02.893
Yeah, you'll make
a good house nigger.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.898
Would you care
for a demitasse?

19:12.736 --> 19:14.863
Sometimes it just be
me and Faye up in here.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.825
Me, Faye
and a little scotch.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.702
Have a good time.

19:24.665 --> 19:26.250
That's how you do it.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.960
You know how to throw
a bash, girl.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.003
What did you do
to this potato salad?

19:30.170 --> 19:32.256
I'll tell you what I did.
I put some dill in it,

19:32.422 --> 19:36.343
because I read in Woman's Day,
where pickles drown out the flavor

19:36.510 --> 19:38.262
and dill bring up the flavor.

19:38.428 --> 19:41.765
- That's what you tasting right now.
- OK. Yeah.

19:41.932 --> 19:44.518
- I like it.
- Make a difference, don't it?

19:44.685 --> 19:45.978
It really does.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.605
Girl, you must be so proud of Cecil.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.358
You know he got that job hisself.
The White House called him,

19:51.525 --> 19:53.819
- he didn't call the White House.
- He's a good man.

19:53.986 --> 19:56.321
- You got a good man.
- She's fun, man!

19:56.488 --> 19:59.324
Not like this one right here.
OI' sourpuss.

19:59.491 --> 20:02.828
- You still mad at me?
- I got reason.

20:02.995 --> 20:06.248
No, you don't. I told you,
I went down to the numbers spot,

20:06.415 --> 20:08.542
played my little numbers,
got me some barbecue,

20:08.709 --> 20:11.628
and then I went down...
I didn't even get nothing to drink!

20:11.795 --> 20:16.174
I am so... I'm so sick of these
numbers spot stories, Howard.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.677
How you expect me to believe you
was down at the numbers spot?

20:18.844 --> 20:20.554
Whether you believe it
or not don't mean it ain't true.

20:20.721 --> 20:22.598
- Come on, stop this mess.
- You want to do this right now?

20:22.764 --> 20:24.349
Come on, y'all.
Come on, come on, come on.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.435
You don't believe it, you don't
have to believe it, but...

20:26.602 --> 20:27.811
- Come on, y'all.
- Such a shuckster.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.688
- You really want to do this right now?
- Stop this right now.

20:29.855 --> 20:31.648
You need to pick on
somebody your own size.

20:31.815 --> 20:34.234
We are here to celebrate,
so y'all could be nice just one time.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.029
You heard the lady.
Come on, get over here, let's celebrate!

20:37.195 --> 20:38.405
Celebrate.

20:38.572 --> 20:40.741
That's why I was out,
trying to make you happy.

20:40.908 --> 20:43.994
- Y'all need to get a room.
- What? What?

20:44.161 --> 20:46.288
Ain't that the truth?
Or something.

20:46.455 --> 20:48.916
He drives me crazy. He just... Ugh!

20:49.875 --> 20:52.628
You ain't, uh...
You want to come to the room with us?

20:52.794 --> 20:54.588
No.

20:54.755 --> 20:57.841
- Hey, where the boys at?
- They upstairs in the back room.

20:58.008 --> 21:00.969
Boys! Get on down here!
I need to see your face now!

21:01.136 --> 21:03.597
- What y'all doing up there?
- Yes, congratulations.

21:03.764 --> 21:05.599
Honey, when you gonna take me
to the White House?

21:05.766 --> 21:08.352
You want to go
to the White House, baby?

21:08.518 --> 21:10.520
You know I want to go
to the White House.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.230
When you want to go?

21:12.397 --> 21:14.566
- Don't play with me now...
- When you want to go?

21:14.733 --> 21:16.818
The White House,
now that's a big step up.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.779
- Ooh!
- Yeah, it's exciting.

21:18.946 --> 21:22.699
Girl, you up in that house now!
I want to hear all the stories.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.993
I don't know how many stories
you gonna hear,

21:25.160 --> 21:27.829
'cause they done swore him
to some kind of secret code,

21:27.996 --> 21:31.541
- and he can't tell me nothing.
- No. Girl, you give it to him right.

21:31.708 --> 21:35.045
- Mm-hm! He'll tell you everything.
- That's the key right there.

21:35.212 --> 21:36.797
You listening?

21:36.964 --> 21:39.174
- Did you hear her?
- Who you been giving it to?

21:39.341 --> 21:41.843
Well, if you was at home,
I could be giving it to you.

21:42.010 --> 21:43.345
I don't know
what you talking about.

21:43.512 --> 21:46.640
Boys, y'all better bring
y'all little narrow butts down here!

21:46.807 --> 21:48.976
- Here they come.
- Called y'all 19 times.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.228
Boys, stop running through this house.
You know better than that.

21:51.395 --> 21:56.191
Elroy! Get over here.
Come here.

21:57.401 --> 21:59.903
Give me some money.

22:00.070 --> 22:04.324
Nah. Tell them... Tell them what
you gonna be when you grow up.

22:04.491 --> 22:07.619
I want to work at the White
House just like Mr. Gaines.

22:07.786 --> 22:09.579
- Ah, that's my boy.
- Right there.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.123
All right, man.

22:11.289 --> 22:13.750
Louis! What you gonna be
when you grow up?

22:13.917 --> 22:15.544
You gonna work at
the White House like your daddy?

22:17.796 --> 22:20.882
- I don't know.
- I'll tell you one thing.

22:21.049 --> 22:23.719
I knew exactly what I wanted
to be when I was 13.

22:23.885 --> 22:26.471
Yeah, a number runner.

22:32.811 --> 22:34.896
I'm Cecil Gaines.
I'm the new butler.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.232
Yes, sir.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.609
<i>There are 16 full-time maids.</i>

22:39.776 --> 22:42.487
<i>We have six butlers,
four carpenters, two painters, </i>

22:42.654 --> 22:45.073
<i>seven electricians,
three dishwashers, three doormen, </i>

22:45.240 --> 22:48.368
<i>a full kitchen staff, including pastry
chef and three full-time calligraphers.</i>

22:48.535 --> 22:51.371
Two painters, seven
electricians, nine engineers...

22:51.538 --> 22:53.707
Here comes Warner.

22:53.874 --> 22:57.836
Uh, Mr. Warner, wanted to thank you
for the opportunity

22:58.003 --> 22:59.713
to work in the White House...

23:06.053 --> 23:08.305
Come on. Here we go.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.852
Ma'am, I'm Cecil Gaines.
I'll be working with you here.

23:14.019 --> 23:15.979
Mr. Gaines,
please don't do that.

23:16.146 --> 23:17.981
- Come on.
- Yes, sir.

23:18.857 --> 23:21.568
Now, when lifting a plate,
never scrape the bottom.

23:21.735 --> 23:24.988
Never listen
or react to conversation.

23:25.155 --> 23:28.700
- The room should feel as...
- Empty when I'm in it.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.496
So then she says...

23:34.414 --> 23:37.292
Then she says, "Stick..."

23:37.459 --> 23:39.336
"OK."

23:39.503 --> 23:41.713
Then she starts
screaming and yells,

23:41.880 --> 23:45.342
"Stick your whole hand in!"
So I put my whole hand in.

23:45.509 --> 23:47.803
Then she yells out,
"Put both hands in!"

23:47.969 --> 23:50.722
"OK!"

23:50.889 --> 23:52.682
Then she screams,
"Now clap!"

23:52.849 --> 23:55.018
I say, "I can't."

23:55.185 --> 23:57.020
She looks up, smiles and says,

23:57.187 --> 23:59.940
"See, I told you my..."

24:00.107 --> 24:01.691
That ain't funny.

24:01.858 --> 24:03.527
Hey, there he is!
Heard you were coming.

24:03.693 --> 24:05.153
- What's your name?
- Cecil.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.072
- Cecil Gaines.
- That ain't funny.

24:07.239 --> 24:10.867
I'm Carter Wilson, head butler.
Don't worry about Big Mo behind you.

24:11.034 --> 24:13.078
That brother will steal your wallet
before you even knew it.

24:13.245 --> 24:15.956
This brother in the mirror over here,
his name's James Holloway.

24:16.123 --> 24:17.624
- He's my second in command.
- James.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.668
Jackie Robinson or Willie Mays?

24:19.835 --> 24:21.044
Why don't you shake
the man's hand first

24:21.211 --> 24:23.296
before you start asking difficult
questions like that?

24:23.463 --> 24:25.132
I just want to know
where the man's coming from.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.592
Look like the jury's still
out on that one, right?

24:27.759 --> 24:30.011
Welcome.
Fancy Freddie give you the tour yet?

24:30.178 --> 24:33.306
He did.
Is the Dodgers still... still losing?

24:33.473 --> 24:35.809
I might be able to answer that question
if Carter over here

24:35.976 --> 24:37.519
stop running his nasty mouth.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.980
Cut the shit
and let's get to work.

25:02.252 --> 25:04.963
- Ready.
- Lord, help us.

25:16.474 --> 25:20.645
Don't be nervous, man.
Just go on and get to it.

25:29.404 --> 25:32.407
You hear nothing,
you see nothing.

25:32.574 --> 25:34.284
You only serve.

25:54.512 --> 25:56.806
Send federal troops to Little Rock?

25:56.973 --> 25:58.433
If it comes to it, yes.

26:00.101 --> 26:04.439
I can't see any situation where
I'd send federal troops to the South.

26:04.606 --> 26:08.777
Ever. Could cause another Civil War.

26:08.944 --> 26:14.699
Sir, if the federal government
doesn't enforce Brown, then who will?

26:14.866 --> 26:16.493
The South must comply with the law.

26:16.660 --> 26:19.329
It's just gonna take some time
to adjust, that's all.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.373
I understand, Mr. President,

26:21.539 --> 26:25.502
but if Faubus continues to block the
Negro children, then what do we do?

26:25.669 --> 26:27.420
We must enforce
the Constitution.

26:28.213 --> 26:30.548
Give Faubus more time.

26:30.715 --> 26:32.384
With a little persuading,
he'll back down.

26:32.550 --> 26:34.469
We just want to move slowly.

26:40.433 --> 26:43.770
- How'd it go?
- I almost shit myself.

26:45.855 --> 26:49.067
I dated a girl once. Every time
I hit her, she shit herself.

26:49.234 --> 26:52.654
- What?
- Got no sense.

26:52.821 --> 26:54.864
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

26:55.031 --> 26:56.408
I put a towel down.

26:58.368 --> 27:00.662
<i>You know, Marcella said
the very same thing last night</i>

27:00.829 --> 27:02.414
<i>just before I put her to sleep.</i>

27:08.712 --> 27:12.299
<i>- Wow. You put her...
- Just like I did Ed.</i>

27:14.092 --> 27:15.844
<i>I'd do it real quick.</i>

27:20.348 --> 27:22.600
<i>- See you!
- Why?</i>

27:24.185 --> 27:27.439
Dang...
Got the popcorn all over the sofa.

27:27.605 --> 27:29.190
Your dad's gonna kill...

27:29.357 --> 27:31.401
Hey, Dad.

27:31.568 --> 27:32.736
- Hi, Mr. Gaines.
- Hey, Dad.

27:32.902 --> 27:35.196
Hey, Elroy.

27:35.363 --> 27:38.616
Louis, I told you about letting these
kids watch that show.

27:38.783 --> 27:40.994
It's too scary.
They're too young for it.

27:41.161 --> 27:42.495
Turn it off.

27:43.496 --> 27:44.956
<i>All you got to do is smile pretty, </i>

27:45.123 --> 27:46.624
<i>and a man will forget
everything he ever learned.</i>

27:46.791 --> 27:48.376
Where your mama at?

27:48.543 --> 27:51.129
Miss Gloria tried staying up,
but she went to sleep.

27:51.296 --> 27:53.131
Elroy, ain't nobody
asked you nothing.

27:53.298 --> 27:54.966
Take your butt home before
your mama come up in here

27:55.133 --> 27:56.259
and whup the both of us.

27:56.426 --> 27:57.594
- Come on, Dad.
- Go on.

27:57.761 --> 27:59.262
- Bye.
- Turn it off.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.898
Don't go stomping up the stairs,
wake your mama up.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.159
What is that?

28:21.326 --> 28:24.245
Is that that Mamie Till stuff?

28:24.412 --> 28:27.582
- I want to go to this.
- Absolutely not.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.837
How come?

28:33.922 --> 28:36.257
Ain't no good can come of that.

28:36.424 --> 28:38.343
Dad, you heard what Mama said?

28:38.510 --> 28:39.636
That mess right there
happened down South.

28:39.803 --> 28:42.555
- This could have been me.
- It happened down South.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.849
I got out of there so we
could have us a better life.

28:45.016 --> 28:48.019
Right now, I'm working for the white
man, make things better for us.

28:48.186 --> 28:49.938
And not just any white man, either.

28:50.105 --> 28:52.482
Put the lights off.
Go to bed.

29:11.251 --> 29:13.294
I have your chicken soup,
Mr. President.

29:13.461 --> 29:15.130
Just set it on the table, Cecil.

29:15.296 --> 29:16.506
Yes, sir.

29:20.218 --> 29:23.471
Did you ever complete school, Cecil?

29:23.638 --> 29:26.266
I didn't go to school,
Mr. President.

29:26.433 --> 29:28.643
I grew up on a cotton farm.

29:28.810 --> 29:31.146
I grew up on a farm.

29:31.312 --> 29:33.523
Do you have any children?

29:33.690 --> 29:35.525
Yes, sir, I have two sons.

29:35.692 --> 29:37.110
Do they go
to an all-colored school?

29:38.820 --> 29:40.738
Yes, sir, they do.

29:47.454 --> 29:49.122
What is it?

29:49.289 --> 29:51.249
State Guard just blocked
all the colored kids again.

29:51.416 --> 29:54.210
Faubus promised me the guards
would escort the kids in.

29:54.377 --> 29:56.546
Governor of Arkansas lied,
Mr. President.

29:56.713 --> 30:00.550
What is wrong with him?
Why is he forcing me to do this?

30:05.805 --> 30:07.724
Yes, sir.

30:08.308 --> 30:10.852
Our next move
needs to be bold and swift.

30:14.814 --> 30:18.276
<i>I have today
issued an executive order</i>

30:18.443 --> 30:21.613
<i>directing the use of troops
under federal authority</i>

30:21.779 --> 30:25.408
<i>to aid in the execution
of federal law</i>

30:25.575 --> 30:28.161
<i>at Little Rock, Arkansas.</i>

30:28.328 --> 30:30.121
<i>This became necessary...</i>

30:30.288 --> 30:33.041
<i>When the president
sent those troops down to Little Rock, </i>

30:33.208 --> 30:38.004
<i>it was the first time I ever seen a
white man stick his neck out for us.</i>

30:39.297 --> 30:43.301
<i>I told Louis that the president was
gonna make things better for us.</i>

30:44.594 --> 30:48.097
All graduations are long.
She was so nosy.

30:48.264 --> 30:50.183
I'm gonna make
some potato salad.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.644
<i>Now he could see that I knew
what I was talking about.</i>

30:52.810 --> 30:55.021
That was wonderful.
I'm so proud of you.

30:55.188 --> 30:58.858
- Thanks, Mama.
- That hat looks stupid.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.777
Your face looks stupid.

31:02.654 --> 31:06.950
- Proud of you, too.
- Dad, did you see...

31:07.116 --> 31:08.952
Don't start something in there.

31:10.370 --> 31:13.039
Did you see one white kid
in my school?

31:21.005 --> 31:25.385
<i>Why couldn't Louis see that
the president made things better for us?</i>

31:26.386 --> 31:27.929
- Thank you.
- Cookie?

31:28.096 --> 31:29.681
- Cookies.
- Thanks.

31:29.847 --> 31:31.599
Thank you.

31:39.274 --> 31:41.067
Boy, I told you
we was gonna be late!

31:41.234 --> 31:42.819
You cannot miss this bus!

31:42.986 --> 31:45.905
- Oh, Lord have mercy.
- Wait, a sec. Wait, wait, wait.

31:46.072 --> 31:48.700
- What?
- Got to say good-bye.

31:48.866 --> 31:51.202
Bus can wait.

31:55.164 --> 31:58.334
Tennessee is
a long ways away, Pop.

31:58.501 --> 32:00.837
Fisk is a really
good school, Dad.

32:01.004 --> 32:03.423
You can change your mind
and go to Howard.

32:03.590 --> 32:07.218
I cannot believe you are still
talking about Howard University.

32:07.385 --> 32:11.347
- He's going to Fisk.
- I know, I know. It's just...

32:11.514 --> 32:13.891
It's just so far away, that's all.

32:14.058 --> 32:16.853
- That's the point.
- What's the point?

32:19.147 --> 32:20.690
Give me a cigarette, and don't
tell me you don't smoke.

32:20.857 --> 32:23.526
- I don't have one.
- Come here.

32:23.693 --> 32:27.322
- You know you want to cry, punk.
- Not for you.

32:27.488 --> 32:30.366
Look under your mattress.
I left you something.

32:30.533 --> 32:34.120
- I can't protect him down South.
- The South has changed, Cecil.

32:34.287 --> 32:35.538
I'm too young for Playboy.

32:35.705 --> 32:36.956
The South ain't what it
was when you was there.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.876
Ma, Louis is leaving me
his filthy magazines.

32:40.043 --> 32:41.878
- Stop lying on your brother.
- Why you slapping him?

32:42.045 --> 32:43.671
He's the one with the magazines.

32:43.838 --> 32:47.091
- I love you, Mama.
- I love you, son.

32:47.258 --> 32:49.177
- I love you, Louis.
- I love you.

32:49.344 --> 32:52.722
- I made you ham sandwiches.
- Thanks, Mama.

32:54.349 --> 32:56.100
Come on, Dad.

32:58.853 --> 33:01.064
OK.

33:08.363 --> 33:09.906
You're the first.

33:11.699 --> 33:14.077
I know.

33:14.243 --> 33:15.995
I'm really proud of you.

33:16.871 --> 33:18.706
I got to go, Dad.

33:24.295 --> 33:27.340
I got to go.

33:32.679 --> 33:34.263
If you need anything, you call me.

33:34.430 --> 33:36.224
- All right.
- All right?

33:36.391 --> 33:37.850
Bye, Mama.

33:44.107 --> 33:46.317
Bye, Louis.

33:55.827 --> 33:57.161
It's all right.

34:06.587 --> 34:08.589
Remind me again why
we're doing this, please.

34:08.755 --> 34:11.592
Somebody? Tell me?
That look like a mugging to me,

34:11.759 --> 34:14.178
- that's what that looks like.
- This is the art of French baking.

34:14.344 --> 34:17.639
Negro, please.
"Art of French baking."

34:17.806 --> 34:19.851
This is absolutely nothing.
That's what this is.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.645
- I don't...
- Boy's always so simple.

34:22.812 --> 34:24.647
You want me to play with it?
I'll play with it.

34:24.813 --> 34:26.565
Play With it like this.

34:26.733 --> 34:29.610
It'd be good if it had a little...
a little nipple on it.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.027
Come on, man.

34:31.195 --> 34:33.239
That's how you play. You jiggle it.
You shake it, you know.

34:33.406 --> 34:34.699
This fool.

34:34.866 --> 34:37.702
Good evening,
Mr. Vice President.

34:39.746 --> 34:42.456
That looks like a tasty treat.

34:42.623 --> 34:44.542
Yes, sir.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.543
I brought you all something.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.009
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

34:53.176 --> 34:54.886
I don't want to say anything negative

34:55.052 --> 34:58.264
about that Kennedy boy.
I'm sure he's a real nice fellow.

34:58.431 --> 35:01.350
But do you really want that
spoiled rich son-of-a-bitch fuck

35:01.517 --> 35:03.936
to be your next president?

35:05.688 --> 35:07.398
Think about it.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.822
We'll cheer for you,
Mr. Vice President.

35:14.989 --> 35:16.741
Thank you, Cecil.

35:19.869 --> 35:22.371
Let me ask you something,
in all candor,

35:22.538 --> 35:26.876
as members of the Negro community,
what are your biggest concerns?

35:30.797 --> 35:32.840
Now, come on now, boys.

35:33.883 --> 35:35.301
Don't be shy.

35:37.762 --> 35:40.431
Holloway, come on.

35:40.598 --> 35:44.268
- Well, since you asked, sir...
- I did.

35:44.435 --> 35:48.397
The colored help gets paid almost
40 percent less than the white help.

35:48.564 --> 35:50.608
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

35:50.775 --> 35:54.612
And it's very difficult for
the colored staff to be promoted.

35:56.113 --> 35:59.116
I'll tell you what. When I'm president,
I'm gonna look into getting you boys

35:59.283 --> 36:01.035
the raises and
the promotions you deserve.

36:01.202 --> 36:04.288
That... that would be swell, sir.

36:04.455 --> 36:08.251
- You got my word on that.
- Thank you, sir.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.169
Now, you tell your people
to vote for me,

36:10.336 --> 36:11.546
and that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

36:11.712 --> 36:14.465
Give that to somebody.

36:39.073 --> 36:41.993
What do you mean, you don't
want to date nobody?

36:42.159 --> 36:43.327
After all these guys
that come after you?

36:43.494 --> 36:46.914
- Girl, please. I'm just...
- Like that one?

36:47.081 --> 36:49.876
I'm talking about you and Isaac.

36:50.042 --> 36:51.335
Now, come on,
tell me what happened.

36:51.502 --> 36:53.129
Y'all seemed happy.

36:53.296 --> 36:55.965
See, I can't even have a normal
conversation with you, because...

37:03.097 --> 37:07.310
- Hey.
- You looking for love, boy?

37:09.353 --> 37:13.482
That's what we call the Lawson workshop,
the love school.

37:13.649 --> 37:17.445
- Is that what you're looking for?
- That's why I came to Fisk.

37:19.238 --> 37:21.115
Me, too.

37:25.411 --> 37:28.789
- I'm Carol Hammie.
- Louis Gaines.

37:28.956 --> 37:30.958
Come on. Follow me.

37:33.210 --> 37:35.338
You a country boy, ain't you?

37:35.504 --> 37:37.632
He's a doctor.
What does your dad do?

37:37.798 --> 37:40.676
He's in politics.

37:40.843 --> 37:43.346
You were gonna need help
finding this place anyway.

37:43.512 --> 37:45.222
...nor can you sustain it
over a month.

37:45.389 --> 37:47.600
- Really?
- This requires time, commitment,

37:47.767 --> 37:49.185
dedication, discipline and focus.

37:49.352 --> 37:52.396
And we are measuring our
accomplishments in waves, right?

37:52.563 --> 37:54.774
This is not a fly-by-night affair.
This doesn't happen over a week.

37:54.941 --> 37:58.194
This requires a fierce discipline,
which is what we've been discussing.

37:58.361 --> 38:00.154
How do you measure these things?

38:00.321 --> 38:02.740
We go back, and we look
at somebody like Gandhi.

38:02.907 --> 38:05.701
Together, we are gonna study
and examine Gandhi's techniques.

38:05.868 --> 38:08.788
What has been so effective
in South Africa, so effective in India,

38:08.955 --> 38:11.457
for his own people and others,

38:11.624 --> 38:14.460
and we're gonna employ it
right here, in Nashville.

38:14.627 --> 38:18.255
So we're gonna form an army.
You and I.

38:18.422 --> 38:21.258
This army has one weapon.
That weapon is love.

38:21.425 --> 38:23.177
Now, I am of the... yes.

38:23.344 --> 38:25.513
If our only weapon is love,

38:25.680 --> 38:27.848
and then their weapons
are weapons,

38:28.015 --> 38:31.519
- I mean, isn't that dangerous?
- Oh, you can be killed.

38:31.686 --> 38:33.896
If anybody's uncomfortable with that,
you know where the door is.

38:34.063 --> 38:36.983
I understand that sounds
provocative, but it's true.

38:38.985 --> 38:42.530
All right, kids.
It's show time.

39:01.716 --> 39:05.428
Gandhi has demonstrated for us
that the brown man,

39:05.594 --> 39:08.222
in his native land, or anywhere
that he's being oppressed...

39:10.433 --> 39:12.143
<i>...can pull himself out
of segregation</i>

39:12.309 --> 39:14.812
with patience, with persistence,

39:14.979 --> 39:17.648
with intelligence and thought,
with discipline...

39:22.194 --> 39:24.155
<i>...and a bit
of a sense of humor.</i>

39:33.497 --> 39:35.374
<i>You know y'all can't sit here.</i>

39:35.541 --> 39:37.752
We would like to be served, please.

39:37.918 --> 39:40.588
<i>This is unprecedented,
what we're talking about, </i>

39:40.755 --> 39:43.841
<i>but it needs a patience
that none of us have ever seen.</i>

39:44.008 --> 39:45.885
You can order food
in the colored section,

39:46.052 --> 39:48.095
but I'm not gonna be
serving you here.

39:48.262 --> 39:51.724
We are organized.
We have a leader with every group.

39:51.891 --> 39:54.435
<i>We have lookouts
with pocket change</i>

39:54.602 --> 39:56.270
<i>and the local phone numbers
for ambulances ready, </i>

39:56.437 --> 39:59.356
<i>and when one wave comes
off that lunch counter, what follows?</i>

39:59.523 --> 40:01.192
<i>A whole 'nother wave
of Negro students</i>

40:01.358 --> 40:03.319
<i>sitting at that lunch counter,
blowing their mind.</i>

40:03.486 --> 40:05.780
We would like
to be served, please.

40:09.450 --> 40:12.036
<i>Now, who wants to role-play?</i>

40:12.203 --> 40:14.497
Jim, I need your help over here.

40:14.663 --> 40:16.499
Now, y'all know you're
not supposed to sit there.

40:16.665 --> 40:19.460
- Attack.
- Get up, nigger! Get up!

40:19.627 --> 40:21.045
This is an experiment.

40:21.212 --> 40:23.380
So do whatever it takes
to break their spirits.

40:23.547 --> 40:25.674
- Come on, get up, nigger.
- Use the language.

40:25.841 --> 40:27.134
I need to hear "nigger" coming
out of your mouth.

40:27.301 --> 40:29.011
- I need to hear "coon."
- I don't feel comfortable saying that.

40:29.178 --> 40:31.806
You came here to get yourself prepared
and to get her prepared.

40:31.972 --> 40:33.891
So let me hear it now.

40:35.017 --> 40:37.228
- Nigger.
- Louder.

40:37.394 --> 40:38.979
Say the words like you mean it.

40:39.146 --> 40:40.940
- Nigger.
- Louder.

40:41.107 --> 40:42.233
You are a nigger!

40:43.400 --> 40:46.028
You need to be sitting
in the colored seating.

40:46.195 --> 40:48.155
This is not for you,
you cannot be served here.

40:48.322 --> 40:50.449
You need to do as you're told
and sit in your place.

40:50.616 --> 40:52.618
- You are a nigger.
- Make her believe it.

40:52.785 --> 40:54.328
- I don't believe you.
- You're a nigger.

40:54.495 --> 40:55.621
You know that's where
the colored people sit.

40:55.788 --> 40:59.208
You see these people over here?
They're in their section over here.

40:59.375 --> 41:02.753
You coon ass!
Get up, you nigger!

41:02.920 --> 41:06.048
If you want us to shop
in this establishment, make them go.

41:06.215 --> 41:07.925
Come on, Robert, let's go.

41:24.567 --> 41:26.402
Nigger lover, get out!

41:26.569 --> 41:28.612
- Get up, monkey. Get up!
- What is this?

41:28.779 --> 41:31.615
Are you listening to us?

41:31.782 --> 41:34.285
This says "whites only."

41:34.451 --> 41:36.912
Get up, nigger. Get up!

41:41.375 --> 41:43.335
- Coons here?
- What are you doing here?

41:43.502 --> 41:44.837
- Does it say "coons?"
- "Whites only."

41:47.423 --> 41:50.176
<i>You don't belong here with them.
This? What is this, huh?</i>

41:50.342 --> 41:52.761
- Does it say "coons" here, huh?
- What are you doing here?

41:52.928 --> 41:55.472
- Pay attention.
- No, this is whites only.

41:56.223 --> 41:58.142
<i>You don't belong here at all.</i>

41:58.851 --> 42:00.895
What are you reading?
I didn't know niggers could read.

42:01.061 --> 42:02.605
What are you, stupid?
You're a nigger lover now?

42:02.771 --> 42:04.690
Get up, you nigger!
Look at me!

42:04.857 --> 42:06.859
- Look at me!
- What are you doing?

42:07.026 --> 42:10.029
You disrespectful monkey. Huh?

42:10.196 --> 42:12.114
Do you understand?
You understand?

42:12.281 --> 42:13.657
Stop it! Stop it!

42:13.824 --> 42:16.118
What do you think you're doing here?

42:18.245 --> 42:21.582
Get up! Get up, you nigger!
Look at me! Look at me!

42:21.749 --> 42:23.709
That up there or is that here?

42:27.171 --> 42:28.464
You don't have to tell me,

42:28.631 --> 42:30.507
- but you have to decide.
- I was a nigger.

42:42.937 --> 42:45.731
- Go back to where you came from!
- Here, you want some coffee?

43:07.002 --> 43:08.712
<i>...the niggers are better
off in their own schools</i>

43:08.879 --> 43:10.214
<i>than they are in the white schools.</i>

43:10.381 --> 43:12.841
- To serving our country.
- Serving our country.

43:13.008 --> 43:14.260
My man.

43:22.226 --> 43:26.689
I feel rich right now.
I like the way that tastes.

43:47.543 --> 43:49.169
<i>They got no business out here.</i>

43:49.336 --> 43:50.754
<i>...better off in their
own schools than they are</i>

43:50.921 --> 43:52.423
<i>in the white schools.</i>

43:57.344 --> 43:59.013
You're all sentenced to 30 days

43:59.179 --> 44:00.597
- in the county jail.
- What?

44:00.764 --> 44:03.434
Bailiff, get these
niggers out of here.

44:25.914 --> 44:28.876
Something special
is going on down here, Dad.

44:32.046 --> 44:35.257
What's so special about
another colored man in jail?

44:37.176 --> 44:40.679
What you doing
with my hard earned money, Pop?

44:40.846 --> 44:42.056
Are you even in school?

44:42.222 --> 44:43.474
I'm trying to change
the way Negroes...

44:43.640 --> 44:45.225
You're breaking the law.

44:46.352 --> 44:49.688
That judge just sentenced you
to 30 days in the county workhouse.

44:49.855 --> 44:51.607
You fixing to get killed.

44:51.774 --> 44:53.192
If I can't sit at any
lunch counter I want,

44:53.359 --> 44:54.985
then I might as well be dead.

44:55.152 --> 44:57.112
- We're fighting for our rights.
- Rights?

44:57.279 --> 44:58.530
- What are you talking about?
- We're trying to change

44:58.697 --> 45:00.074
the nation's consciousness
toward the American Negro.

45:00.240 --> 45:01.492
Them postcards you've been sending me?

45:01.658 --> 45:03.535
- You're a damn liar.
- I have been in school.

45:06.580 --> 45:08.499
Who do you think you're talking to?

45:08.665 --> 45:10.876
I brought you into this world,
I can take you out of it.

45:43.951 --> 45:47.329
- Y'all been able to talk to him?
- Talk to who?

45:47.496 --> 45:50.457
- Louis.
- Yeah, we talk to him.

45:51.625 --> 45:54.128
Said he's joined something
called the "Freedom Riders,"

45:54.294 --> 45:56.839
whatever the hell
that's supposed to mean.

45:57.005 --> 45:58.382
You gonna see him?

45:58.549 --> 46:00.551
I been fixing to trying to see him.

46:00.717 --> 46:02.845
Every time I do,
Cecil get all riled up.

46:03.011 --> 46:04.972
So I don't know when
that's gonna happen.

46:05.139 --> 46:07.474
"Fixing to trying."
See, that's the problem.

46:07.641 --> 46:10.561
You got to stop trying,
and you just got to do it.

46:10.727 --> 46:12.771
He take you
to the White House yet?

46:14.398 --> 46:17.067
No. Cecil say we're going soon.

46:17.234 --> 46:19.820
"Cecil say, Cecil say."

46:19.987 --> 46:23.615
Four years. That's what makes
you a little bit gullible, darling.

46:23.782 --> 46:25.909
I don't understand.
I don't understand why he can't

46:26.076 --> 46:28.370
- get the president to do something.
- See, Gina, that's your problem.

46:28.537 --> 46:30.747
You just say stupid stuff.

46:30.914 --> 46:35.127
President got more to do than be
thinking about Louis' foolishness.

46:36.503 --> 46:38.964
You know,
why don't you just shut up?

46:39.131 --> 46:42.468
It's just a mess.
Be nice.

46:42.634 --> 46:45.596
Who told you
you could tell me to shut up?

46:45.762 --> 46:47.764
- Well... You...
- Go get me a drink.

46:47.931 --> 46:49.475
I want some scotch.

46:51.226 --> 46:56.023
Well, I personally think Louis is
gonna get every one of us killed.

46:56.190 --> 46:58.859
They coming to get us.
They coming to get us.

46:59.026 --> 47:02.362
He crazy like his mama.

47:02.529 --> 47:04.490
I meant it in a good way.

47:05.866 --> 47:09.203
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.

47:09.369 --> 47:11.246
Get back over here.

47:11.413 --> 47:13.373
Let me get your ass.

47:13.540 --> 47:18.921
<i>I received also a wire from
President Eisenhower, which says...</i>

47:19.087 --> 47:22.132
<i>The president lives
at the White House</i>

47:22.299 --> 47:25.552
<i>until the moment the next one
is sworn in.</i>

47:25.719 --> 47:28.388
<i>So the staff has exactly two hours</i>

47:28.555 --> 47:33.268
<i>during the inauguration ceremony,
to move the old president out</i>

47:33.435 --> 47:35.771
<i>and move the new one in.</i>

47:35.938 --> 47:40.609
They say
this new white boy's smooth.

47:40.776 --> 47:42.945
I just need to get my
butt home to Gloria.

47:43.111 --> 47:45.614
'Cause these hours,
they're killing us.

47:45.781 --> 47:47.366
How's your boy doing, Cecil?

47:47.533 --> 47:50.577
Gentlemen, the president's arriving.

47:54.540 --> 47:56.792
- OK.
- Where shall we start?

47:56.959 --> 47:58.418
I'm not sure.
This end, maybe over there?

47:58.585 --> 48:00.045
- Thank you.
- Right this way, Mr. President.

48:00.212 --> 48:03.006
- Hello, everyone.
- Mr. President.

48:03.173 --> 48:06.301
I am thrilled to be
working with all of you

48:06.468 --> 48:08.178
over the next four years.

48:08.345 --> 48:10.847
Eight years, Jack.

48:12.099 --> 48:13.684
Well, you see who wears
the pants around here.

48:15.269 --> 48:17.896
I'm not gonna remember any
of your names, but I'm gonna try.

48:18.063 --> 48:20.107
Jessie. It's a good thing you're here
'cause I'm gonna forget.

48:20.274 --> 48:23.026
- Thank you. This is Lorraine.
- Pleasure to meet you.

48:23.193 --> 48:24.653
- Mr. President.
- How are you, James?

48:24.820 --> 48:25.821
- Carter.
- Pleasure, Mr. President.

48:25.988 --> 48:27.531
- Carter.
- This is Cecil.

48:27.698 --> 48:29.157
- Pleasure to meet you, Mr. President.
- How are you?

48:29.324 --> 48:30.492
- William.
- Mrs. Kennedy.

48:30.659 --> 48:32.578
- Greg.
- How are you?

48:32.744 --> 48:33.912
Winslow.

48:34.079 --> 48:36.164
I got it. She's all right.

48:37.291 --> 48:39.084
Pleasure to meet you,
Miss Caroline.

48:39.251 --> 48:40.460
- Miles.
- Miles.

48:41.503 --> 48:44.840
What's that on your breath,
Gloria? Stop, OK. Stop.

48:45.007 --> 48:46.675
- What's that?
- Baby, that's gin.

48:46.842 --> 48:49.678
- I can smell it from here.
- It said "Addison's disease."

48:49.845 --> 48:51.138
Stop. Stop it, will you stop?

48:51.305 --> 48:53.515
Did you take Charlie
to the dentist today?

48:56.893 --> 48:59.646
Somebody at the White House
got Addison's disease?

49:02.441 --> 49:05.235
No, I did not take Charlie
to the dentist today.

49:05.402 --> 49:08.196
And what you asking me about it for?
You never home.

49:08.363 --> 49:10.866
Now you gonna act like you gonna
take Charlie to the dentist?

49:11.033 --> 49:13.952
You ain't never here.
I don't know how you gonna take him.

49:14.119 --> 49:16.496
His teeth fall out,
waiting on you to take him.

49:16.663 --> 49:20.917
Just go to bed, Gloria.
I'll take him tomorrow.

49:21.084 --> 49:23.629
How many pairs of shoes
does she have?

49:26.381 --> 49:30.302
I said, how many pairs of shoes
does Mrs. Jackie Kennedy have?

49:30.469 --> 49:32.554
How the hell do I know?

49:36.558 --> 49:39.061
You're in that ol' White House
day and night.

49:39.227 --> 49:40.979
Thought you knew everything.

49:44.858 --> 49:46.943
Coming in,
trying to tell me what to do.

49:47.110 --> 49:49.821
Worried about me drinking.

49:49.988 --> 49:52.366
You ought to be worried
about your house.

49:52.532 --> 49:54.993
Our boy's in jail, Cecil.

49:55.160 --> 49:58.914
Our boy's in jail,
and you can't come home.

50:00.123 --> 50:03.251
You... You don't see I'm here,
trying to talk to you?

50:05.337 --> 50:09.841
I bet you wish I spoke French,
just like Jackie.

50:10.008 --> 50:12.469
Jackie Kennedy.

50:12.636 --> 50:15.430
Que sera, sera.

50:16.807 --> 50:19.476
You like that?

50:19.643 --> 50:21.436
You like the way she talk?

50:22.896 --> 50:24.981
Cecil,
you hear me talking to you.

50:26.066 --> 50:27.859
You ain't asleep.

50:44.584 --> 50:46.837
<i>Bobby told the president</i>

50:47.003 --> 50:49.631
<i>they shouldn't be worried about
the Negro sit-ins.</i>

50:49.798 --> 50:53.176
<i>Polls show the US
does not support civil rights.</i>

50:53.343 --> 50:57.097
Told you that white boy was smooth.
A little too smooth for my money.

51:03.145 --> 51:06.940
- Hey, Cecil, how's your boy doing?
- Out of jail, says he's back in school,

51:07.107 --> 51:09.276
but I think he's doing
that freedom riding thing.

51:09.443 --> 51:11.737
How's Gloria doing
with that drinking?

51:13.196 --> 51:14.781
She's hanging.

51:18.118 --> 51:21.121
They say that cat
that's playing is a big deal.

51:21.288 --> 51:25.083
- Pablo Casals, world famous.
- Course he's world famous.

51:25.250 --> 51:27.002
You think Mrs. Kennedy
is gonna have, uh...

51:27.169 --> 51:29.463
some backwoods country fiddle
band playing out there for her?

51:29.629 --> 51:31.006
- Man.
- Why don't you start a band?

51:31.173 --> 51:32.758
Maybe you can go out there, too.

51:32.924 --> 51:35.051
You know what, in fact,
let's all start a band.

51:35.218 --> 51:37.012
I'll play the bongos.
What about you?

51:37.179 --> 51:39.473
I play a mean... skin flute.

51:43.310 --> 51:46.563
He refuses to play in any country
that recognizes Franco's regime.

51:46.730 --> 51:48.607
Who's Franco?

51:51.067 --> 51:52.736
- Forget it, man.
- Huh?

51:52.903 --> 51:55.989
Forget it. You're ignorant.

52:07.584 --> 52:09.503
Carol, are you tired?

52:09.669 --> 52:12.214
You just want me to put my head
on your shoulder.

52:12.380 --> 52:13.590
What wrong with that?

52:13.757 --> 52:14.966
I'm not putting my head
on your shoulder.

52:15.133 --> 52:16.134
You can.

52:19.513 --> 52:20.764
Ever been
on a freedom bus before?

52:20.931 --> 52:22.224
- No, it's my first time.
- No?

52:22.390 --> 52:24.267
- How's your boyfriend feel about that?
- My boyfriend?

52:24.434 --> 52:28.146
Yeah. I mean,
this must upset him, right?

52:28.313 --> 52:29.981
You being on this bus down here.

52:30.148 --> 52:32.234
- I don't have a boyfriend.
- You don't have a boyfriend?

52:32.400 --> 52:34.444
How do you not have a boyfriend?

52:38.990 --> 52:40.826
- You want some peanuts?
- No, thank you.

52:40.992 --> 52:43.453
- You like peanuts or...?
- I don't like peanuts.

52:43.620 --> 52:46.248
- I'm too hot to eat.
- Hey, can I have some of those?

52:46.414 --> 52:48.708
- Long bus ride.
- OK.

52:53.964 --> 52:56.675
Louis, what is that?

53:02.931 --> 53:06.560
- It's a cross. It's a cross.
- Driver, turn! Turn the bus!

53:10.021 --> 53:11.356
Oh, shit.

53:18.738 --> 53:20.240
Niggers, get out here!

53:20.407 --> 53:23.952
Nigger, go home!
Nigger, go home!

54:14.628 --> 54:17.047
Oh, my God.
Everybody out!

54:26.806 --> 54:29.017
<i>"In an old house in Paris</i>

54:29.184 --> 54:32.395
<i>that was covered with vines...</i>

<i>...lived 12 little girls

- Like Caroline.
- Mm-hm.

54:45.158 --> 54:47.869
"She was not afraid of mice."

54:48.036 --> 54:51.081
Why do people ride
in the freedom bus?

54:54.876 --> 54:56.711
Uncle Bobby told my daddy

54:56.878 --> 55:00.548
that the freedom bus
exploded today.

55:05.720 --> 55:07.847
<i>I can't tell you
if I walked off the bus</i>

55:08.014 --> 55:11.559
<i>or if I crawled off
or if someone pulled me off.</i>

55:12.644 --> 55:15.438
<i>I didn't know if my boy
was dead or alive.</i>

55:15.605 --> 55:18.358
<i>When I got off the bus,
a man came up to me, </i>

55:18.525 --> 55:20.443
<i>and I'm coughing and strangling, </i>

55:20.610 --> 55:22.320
<i>and he said, "Boy, you all right?"</i>

55:22.487 --> 55:25.824
<i>And I nodded my head,
and the next thing I knew, </i>

55:25.991 --> 55:27.659
<i>I was on the ground.</i>

55:27.826 --> 55:31.621
<i>He had hit me with a baseball bat.</i>

55:33.123 --> 55:34.541
Hello.

55:34.708 --> 55:37.711
Hi, Dad.
I'm in Mississippi.

55:39.421 --> 55:40.880
<i>I thought you was in Alabama.</i>

55:41.047 --> 55:44.300
<i>We spent two weeks in jail
there, now we're in Mississippi.</i>

55:44.467 --> 55:46.720
I want you to listen
to me, Louis.

55:46.886 --> 55:49.097
I want you to come home.

55:49.264 --> 55:52.058
<i>I know we ain't seen eye to eye, </i>

55:52.225 --> 55:54.436

she wants you home.</i>

55:57.939 --> 56:00.150
- They're keeping me.
- How long?

56:00.316 --> 56:02.068
<i>- Where is he?
- I don't know.</i>

56:02.235 --> 56:03.945
<i>They said three months.</i>

56:04.112 --> 56:06.865
<i>When I get out,
I'm gonna take another ride.</i>

56:07.032 --> 56:09.993
- What are you talking about?
- What's he saying?

56:10.160 --> 56:11.745
Let me talk to him.
Give me that phone.

56:11.911 --> 56:14.664
<i>It is my right to ride that bus.
That is my legal right.</i>

56:14.831 --> 56:18.001
I will exercise my rights
as an American citizen.

56:18.168 --> 56:21.212
<i>American citizen.
What you talking about?</i>

56:21.379 --> 56:23.131
You know what
they're gonna do to you?

56:23.298 --> 56:25.717
They're gonna lynch you

56:25.884 --> 56:28.803
and then they're gonna throw
your little ass in the river.

56:29.846 --> 56:31.264
They're gonna kill you.

56:31.431 --> 56:34.350

gonna have to kill me.

56:41.274 --> 56:44.611
<i>The situation was perilously
close to an explosion.</i>

56:44.778 --> 56:47.614
Arrests were made in mass lots.

56:47.781 --> 56:50.200
<i>Everyone charged

What's wrong, baby?

57:58.017 --> 58:02.188
- What's wrong with me is this.
- What are you talking about?

58:02.355 --> 58:06.192
This is what's wrong with me.
This is wrong. This is wrong.

58:06.359 --> 58:09.571
- We ain't been wrong yet.
- I can't do this to Cecil.

58:09.737 --> 58:12.323
We ain't doing it to Cecil.
I'm doing it to you.

58:12.490 --> 58:15.034
I want you out of my house.

58:16.202 --> 58:19.205
Why do you think God brought us
next to each other each day?

58:19.372 --> 58:22.208
- God ain't got nothing to do with this.
- He put you right next door to me.

58:22.375 --> 58:24.836
You always talking about how
lonely you are without Cecil

58:25.003 --> 58:27.338
being at the White House,
and you need a man that can

58:27.505 --> 58:30.758
appreciate the love and the
woman that you are, like I do.

58:30.925 --> 58:33.511
I want your number-running
ass up out of my house,

58:33.678 --> 58:36.347
off of my sofa right now.

58:37.182 --> 58:39.726
I'm... I'm through.
I told you.

58:39.893 --> 58:41.394
Let me make
a demonstration for you.

58:41.561 --> 58:43.479
Don't come here with
this bullshit crazy talk.

58:43.646 --> 58:45.356
- It's not.
- Some more of this...

58:45.523 --> 58:47.859
This is you, right? You got
your direction that you move in.

58:48.026 --> 58:52.572
- What you doing with my hangers?
- This is you, and this is me.

58:52.739 --> 58:56.034
Now, we seem like we don't fit at all.
We just crash into each other.

58:56.201 --> 58:59.621
But then when
you align things properly,

58:59.787 --> 59:01.664
like God putting you
next door to me,

59:01.831 --> 59:05.126
everything kind of works out.

59:05.293 --> 59:09.130
And even if you slow down,
I got you.

59:10.298 --> 59:12.800
You need to get your yellow
ass up out of my house.

59:12.967 --> 59:15.678
- We need each other.
- What I need is my husband.

59:15.845 --> 59:18.556
And not to be laying up here
in the gutter with you.

59:30.443 --> 59:33.404
On average, how many pills do
you think I take a day, Cecil?

59:34.906 --> 59:38.159
About... 103, sir.

59:41.537 --> 59:44.791
- Help me up.
- Mr. President.

59:51.631 --> 59:54.384
I know your son is a Freedom Ryder.

59:57.136 --> 01:00:00.765
He's in prison right now in Birmingham
with Martin Luther King.

01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:09.107
Do you, uh...

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.360
...you know how he is, sir?

01:00:12.527 --> 01:00:16.948
I'm guessing he's pretty beat up,
but based on his record,

01:00:17.115 --> 01:00:19.033
he must be used to it.

01:00:21.786 --> 01:00:25.164
Cecil, he's been arrested 16 times
over the past two years.

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:29.585
Yes, sir.

01:00:34.132 --> 01:00:37.093
- Will that be all, sir?
- That's it.

01:00:40.555 --> 01:00:42.640
You know, I never understood

01:00:42.807 --> 01:00:44.684
what you all really went through...

01:00:46.269 --> 01:00:48.521
...until I saw that.

01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:53.776
My brother says these kids have...

01:00:56.154 --> 01:00:57.822
...changed his heart.

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:05.621
They've changed mine, too.

01:01:21.846 --> 01:01:24.098
<i>I am therefore
asking the Congress</i>

01:01:24.265 --> 01:01:26.142
<i>to enact legislation</i>

01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:29.187
giving all Americans the right
to be served in facilities

01:01:29.354 --> 01:01:30.688
which are open to the public.

01:01:30.855 --> 01:01:33.608
<i>Hotels, restaurants, theaters, </i>

01:01:33.775 --> 01:01:36.778
<i>retail stores
and similar establishments.</i>

01:01:36.944 --> 01:01:40.198
<i>This seems to me to be
an elementary right.</i>

01:01:40.365 --> 01:01:42.658
<i>Its denial is
an arbitrary indignity</i>

01:01:42.825 --> 01:01:47.163
<i>that no American in 1963
should have to endure, but many do.</i>

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:49.832
<i>A great change is at hand.</i>

01:01:49.999 --> 01:01:54.253
<i>And our task, our obligation,
is to make that revolution, </i>

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:59.300
<i>that change,
peaceful and constructive for all.</i>

01:01:59.467 --> 01:02:03.596
<i>Those who do nothing are
inviting shame as well as violence...</i>

01:02:25.243 --> 01:02:30.248
Hey. Hey, Cecil.
Cecil, what's wrong?

01:02:33.042 --> 01:02:34.919
Cecil?

01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:39.340
Cecil?

01:02:40.842 --> 01:02:42.593
They blew his...

01:02:43.719 --> 01:02:45.638
...head off.

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:52.478
- Who are you talking about?
- Kennedy.

01:02:59.026 --> 01:03:01.195
<i>President Kennedy was shot</i>

01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:03.906
<i>as he drove from Dallas airport
to downtown Dallas...</i>

01:03:04.073 --> 01:03:05.158
<i>They killed him.</i>

01:03:05.324 --> 01:03:08.703
<i>Governor Connally of Texas
in the car with him was also shot.</i>

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:11.372
<i>It is reported that
three bullets rang out.</i>

01:03:11.539 --> 01:03:13.583
<i>A Secret Serviceman has been...</i>

01:03:13.749 --> 01:03:16.210
<i>They killed our man.</i>

01:03:16.377 --> 01:03:19.422
<i>"He's dead." Whether he
referred to President Kennedy or not</i>

01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:21.299
<i>is not yet known.</i>

01:03:21.466 --> 01:03:24.760
<i>The president, cradled in the
arms of his wife, Mrs. Kennedy, </i>

01:03:24.927 --> 01:03:27.472
<i>was carried to an ambulance
and the car rushed</i>

01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:29.515
<i>to Parkland Hospital
outside Dallas...</i>

01:03:29.682 --> 01:03:33.352
<i>Mrs. Kennedy refused
to change her clothes, </i>

01:03:33.519 --> 01:03:38.024
<i>so that everybody could see
what they did to her husband.</i>

01:03:45.865 --> 01:03:48.951
<i>The last time
I saw that much blood</i>

01:03:49.118 --> 01:03:52.038
<i>was the day my daddy was killed.</i>

01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:03.424
Please tell me how I could help you.

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:43.214
Ma, what you doing?

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:48.344
Here. Want you to take this box
and put it in the basement.

01:04:48.511 --> 01:04:50.680
- Make sure you label it "trophies."
- This is Louis' stuff, Ma.

01:04:50.846 --> 01:04:52.348
You know he gonna be pissed.

01:04:52.515 --> 01:04:54.225
I don't care nothing about
Louis being pissed.

01:04:54.392 --> 01:04:56.519
I'm the one pissed.
He ain't been here in three years.

01:04:56.686 --> 01:04:58.229
Why you pissed, Mama?

01:04:58.396 --> 01:05:00.064
And don't put that next
to my jarred okra either.

01:05:00.231 --> 01:05:01.857
Ain't nobody trying to smell
that stankin' okra.

01:05:02.024 --> 01:05:03.943
And when you come back, I want
you to get me some fish food.

01:05:22.837 --> 01:05:25.548
Look what the president...

01:05:25.715 --> 01:05:27.383
...Mrs. Kennedy gave me.

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:29.719
Belonged to the president.

01:05:32.597 --> 01:05:34.223
Gloria...

01:05:35.391 --> 01:05:36.976
President was killed.

01:05:38.644 --> 01:05:40.855
I'm really sorry about the president.

01:05:41.731 --> 01:05:43.608
I really am.

01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:46.110
But you and that White House
can kiss my ass.

01:05:46.277 --> 01:05:48.029
I don't care what
goes on in that house.

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:50.239
I care about what goes on in this house.

01:06:28.778 --> 01:06:33.991
<i>I knew that Gloria had been
unhappy for some time now.</i>

01:06:35.159 --> 01:06:37.870
<i>I knew that's probably
why she drank.</i>

01:06:39.372 --> 01:06:42.416
<i>She wanted me to get along
better with Louis.</i>

01:06:43.959 --> 01:06:46.128
<i>I didn't know how.</i>

01:06:46.295 --> 01:06:47.838
<i>I couldn't.</i>

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:52.968
<i>I could cut back them
long hours at the White House.</i>

01:06:53.135 --> 01:06:55.388
<i>And I did just that.</i>

01:06:55.554 --> 01:06:57.640
How many pairs of shoes she got?

01:06:57.807 --> 01:07:00.685
She got about... 125.

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:03.354
- A hundred twenty-five pairs of shoes?
- Yeah.

01:07:03.521 --> 01:07:08.234
Put them in a line from the blacks
all the way to the whites.

01:07:08.609 --> 01:07:12.196
And I'll tell you what. Next time
there's a light on in an empty room,

01:07:12.363 --> 01:07:15.366
I will fire every sorry son of a bitch
in this house. I mean it, Cecil!

01:07:15.533 --> 01:07:18.661
Go back to Texas and run the country
from a dirt shack if I have to.

01:07:18.828 --> 01:07:20.204
Is that what you want?

01:07:20.371 --> 01:07:21.956
Who do you think pays the
goddamned bills around here?

01:07:22.123 --> 01:07:23.457
I don't, but you
know what I mean.

01:07:23.624 --> 01:07:24.917
Yes, sir.

01:07:26.085 --> 01:07:28.796
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

01:07:28.963 --> 01:07:32.049
Lady Bird and I want you to have this.

01:07:32.216 --> 01:07:35.511
- Matches your eyes.
- Thank you, sir.

01:07:38.431 --> 01:07:40.516
- Get it, Gloria.
- Do it, baby.

01:07:40.683 --> 01:07:43.102
Swim it! Go ahead, Gloria.

01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:47.398
- I see you, baby.
- You see me, babe? Put it on.

01:07:50.818 --> 01:07:52.528
Get it, Gloria.

01:07:52.695 --> 01:07:55.448
- Now that's what I'm talking about.
- Get it, girl! Shake it out! Get it!

01:07:59.952 --> 01:08:02.204
Negro! Get out here.

01:08:02.371 --> 01:08:03.998
Back there stinking up
my bathroom.

01:08:04.165 --> 01:08:05.791
- Oh, Lord.
- Oh, Lord.

01:08:05.958 --> 01:08:07.251
What you doing?

01:08:07.418 --> 01:08:09.378
Hey! Whoo!

01:08:09.545 --> 01:08:11.672
What?

01:08:11.839 --> 01:08:13.090
Get you some!

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:17.219
- You know.
- That's your friend.

01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:21.474
Give me my wig!
What's wrong with you?!

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:24.393
- This my good wig!
- Oh, shit!

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.229
- Sit down.
- We got the spades up.

01:08:27.395 --> 01:08:28.856
Brother just handling his business.

01:08:29.023 --> 01:08:30.691
He can still do the splits,
I'll tell you.

01:08:30.858 --> 01:08:33.068
James told me
that Dr. King told the president

01:08:33.234 --> 01:08:36.279
that we would be going to the streets
down South for our right to vote.

01:08:36.447 --> 01:08:38.157
- Didn't you, baby?
- What?

01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:40.367
Didn't you tell me
that Dr. King told the president

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.578
that we was going down South
for our right to vote?

01:08:42.745 --> 01:08:45.288
- I ain't make that up.
- Is that what you heard?

01:08:45.456 --> 01:08:47.582
That Dr. King ain't no joke,
with his little militant ass.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.127
- She talking too damned much.
- Well, sound like somebody talking.

01:08:50.294 --> 01:08:51.212
Shut up.

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.881
- Leave my bird alone.
- Well, you know them three kids

01:08:54.048 --> 01:08:56.801
got killed down there, trying to get
colored folks registered to vote.

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.301
That's why I didn't want
Louis to go down there.

01:08:58.469 --> 01:08:59.886
That's what I was
trying to tell you.

01:09:00.054 --> 01:09:01.388
You shouldn't have
sent him down there.

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:03.599
- I know.
- He is down there now,

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:05.643
and there ain't nothing
we can do about it.

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.353
The only reason
the president sent the FBI

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:08.729
is 'cause two of them were white.

01:09:08.895 --> 01:09:11.774
- Now who told you that?
- Yeah, who told her that?

01:09:11.941 --> 01:09:15.611
It was in one of them colored newspapers
from Baltimore. That all right with you?

01:09:15.778 --> 01:09:18.113
See, she getting smart now.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:20.407
Honey, you think the president
ought to do something

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.993
- about the Voting Rights bill?
- That ain't the trump.

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.662
President Johnson
just passed the greatest piece

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:27.832
of civil rights legislation
since Lincoln freed the slaves.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.459
It's gonna be very difficult to
pass another bill anytime soon.

01:09:30.626 --> 01:09:32.837
- That's it.
- You see how my wife quizzes me?

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:35.965
- I get it every day.
- Only, you got to know

01:09:36.131 --> 01:09:38.175
how much to say,
when you cross the line.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:39.885
You deal with your woman,
I'll deal with mine.

01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:42.095
At least you tell your wife
what's going on over there.

01:09:42.263 --> 01:09:43.680
- Aces!
- Damn!

01:09:43.848 --> 01:09:45.975
Can't be a king
in your own castle.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:48.143
You hit the strip joint,
that's what I say.

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:51.856
Hey, uh, Glo. Did you hear about
your neighbor, Howard?

01:09:54.108 --> 01:09:58.904
Guy down on 8th Street,
caught him in bed with his wife.

01:09:59.071 --> 01:10:00.531
Shot him dead.

01:10:00.698 --> 01:10:03.868
- Shot him in the back.
- That's it. That's all of it.

01:10:04.034 --> 01:10:08.122
I don't know, maybe he got
what he deserved.

01:10:09.456 --> 01:10:11.375
<i>You sorry sap asses
got to realize</i>

01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:13.460
the Negro ain't gonna take it no more.

01:10:13.627 --> 01:10:15.462
This entire country is a tinderbox.

01:10:15.629 --> 01:10:19.049
Goddamn tinderbox of nigger rage
just waiting to explode!

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:21.343
Now, I want you all
to get on the phone,

01:10:21.510 --> 01:10:23.721
call the NAACP, CORE
and whoever else

01:10:23.888 --> 01:10:25.389
will listen to your sorry asses

01:10:25.556 --> 01:10:27.766
and help me keep them Negroes
off the street.

01:10:27.933 --> 01:10:31.020
Buck, I smell your ass from here!
What the hell are you waiting for?!

01:10:31.186 --> 01:10:34.106
Jesus Christ.

01:10:34.273 --> 01:10:36.984
Cecil, get me some of
that goddamned prune juice.

01:10:43.115 --> 01:10:46.035
I'm not sure what to make
of Malcolm X.

01:10:46.201 --> 01:10:47.703
I know what to make of him.

01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:49.872
Got a better plan
in place than Dr. King.

01:10:50.039 --> 01:10:53.250
If someone puts their hands on
you, put them in the cemetery.

01:10:53.417 --> 01:10:56.545
- That a better plan?
- Ooh, We fixin' to go.

01:10:56.712 --> 01:10:58.005
Bye, Claramay.

01:10:58.172 --> 01:11:00.090
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:11:01.717 --> 01:11:03.510
I mean...

01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:08.849
You just mad 'cause he was
talking about your daddy.

01:11:09.016 --> 01:11:10.935
What?

01:11:11.101 --> 01:11:13.103
He was saying all that
stuff about house Negroes.

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:15.189
I saw you get mad.

01:11:15.356 --> 01:11:17.608
My dad is not a house Negro.

01:11:21.445 --> 01:11:24.323
- He a butler, ain't he?
- Don't talk about my dad.

01:11:24.490 --> 01:11:26.867
I don't talk about your dad,
all right?

01:11:27.034 --> 01:11:28.869
That's 'cause my daddy's
proud of what I'm doing.

01:11:42.758 --> 01:11:44.551
You all right?

01:12:27.136 --> 01:12:31.598
<i>Everybody went to church to
raise money for the kids down in Selma.</i>

01:12:32.433 --> 01:12:36.937
<i>But I didn't go. I wasn't gonna give
money to pay for my son to be killed.</i>

01:12:44.403 --> 01:12:48.115
<i>Once again, them kids got beat.</i>

01:12:48.282 --> 01:12:53.245
<i>This one was so bad that the press
called it "Bloody Sunday."</i>

01:12:53.412 --> 01:12:55.289
<i>They barely left Selma.</i>

01:12:55.456 --> 01:12:58.083
<i>They marched in small groups
through the city of Selma</i>

01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:59.960
<i>- and were not stopped...
- ...mortars and rockets...</i>

01:13:00.127 --> 01:13:02.129
<i>...can pound Con Thien
around the clock</i>

01:13:02.296 --> 01:13:03.964
<i>with devastating effect.</i>

01:13:04.131 --> 01:13:05.799
<i>And our ground troops
cannot go into...</i>

01:13:05.966 --> 01:13:07.718
<i>...it was a different story.</i>

01:13:07.885 --> 01:13:10.554
<i>Mounted sheriff's deputies
helped to break up the column.</i>

01:13:10.721 --> 01:13:12.431
<i>Once the line was broken...</i>

01:13:12.598 --> 01:13:15.017
How are your boys, Cecil?

01:13:22.816 --> 01:13:27.237
I don't know how my oldest is,
Mr. President.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:29.656
I believe he might
be in Selma.

01:13:29.823 --> 01:13:32.284
And, you know,
sometime I feel like

01:13:32.451 --> 01:13:34.703
we're living in
two different worlds.

01:13:36.997 --> 01:13:39.083
Just want to keep him safe.

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:43.128
<i>...marchers were
treated for tear gas burns, </i>

01:13:43.295 --> 01:13:44.838
<i>open wounds and broken bones.</i>

01:13:45.005 --> 01:13:46.423
<i>One hospital treated...</i>

01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:52.304
<i>Every American citizen
must have an equal right to vote.</i>

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:56.809
<i>Yet the harsh fact is that
in many places in this country, </i>

01:13:56.975 --> 01:14:01.355
<i>men and women
are kept from voting</i>

01:14:01.522 --> 01:14:04.066
<i>simply because they are Negroes.</i>

01:14:04.233 --> 01:14:05.943
"Negroes?"

01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:08.570
Since when did he start
calling us Negroes?

01:14:09.655 --> 01:14:11.573
That nigger uses the word
"nigger" more than I use it.

01:14:12.908 --> 01:14:15.536
<i>But really it's all of us...</i>

01:14:15.702 --> 01:14:20.707
<i>...who must overcome
the crippling legacy</i>

01:14:20.874 --> 01:14:23.877
<i>of bigotry and injustice.</i>

01:14:24.044 --> 01:14:26.588
<i>And we shall overcome.</i>

01:14:31.802 --> 01:14:33.554
<i>First,
a barrage of cover fire, </i>

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.597
<i>and then a charge across the street.</i>

01:14:35.764 --> 01:14:38.350
<i>The Marines moved out from
the fortified Army compound</i>

01:14:38.517 --> 01:14:40.144
<i>blitzed by the original attack.</i>

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:42.062
<i>Hey, hey, LBJ!</i>

01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:44.439
<i>How many kids
did you kill today?!</i>

01:14:44.606 --> 01:14:46.650
<i>Hey, hey, LBJ!</i>

01:14:46.817 --> 01:14:48.569
<i>How many kids
did you kill today?!</i>

01:14:48.735 --> 01:14:50.237
<i>...the ancient imperial city.</i>

01:14:50.404 --> 01:14:53.657
<i>It is to Vietnamese
what old Boston is to Americans, </i>

01:14:53.824 --> 01:14:56.660
<i>where many of its country's
leaders are born or educated.</i>

01:14:56.827 --> 01:14:59.705
I wish they'd shut up.

01:14:59.872 --> 01:15:03.000
<i>The first sniper shots ricochet
around the thick walls of the building, </i>

01:15:03.167 --> 01:15:06.879
<i>taking the first casualties
of the first squad.</i>

01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:09.006
<i>The snipers may be
only two or three, </i>

01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:11.758
<i>invisible to the buildings
beyond the wall.</i>

01:15:11.925 --> 01:15:14.303
<i>But there is also a machine gun
down the street to the left.</i>

01:15:14.469 --> 01:15:18.932
Dr. King, you might want to
lie down with that fever.

01:15:19.850 --> 01:15:24.438
President Johnson is making
a tragic error in Vietnam.

01:15:24.605 --> 01:15:27.274
Move over, big yellow.

01:15:27.441 --> 01:15:29.526
Why shouldn't we fight in Vietnam?

01:15:29.693 --> 01:15:31.778
The Vietcong don't call us
"niggers," for one.

01:15:35.073 --> 01:15:38.535
Seriously, how many of
your parents support the war?

01:15:39.870 --> 01:15:44.333
Well, my Lord.
Why do your parents support it?

01:15:45.459 --> 01:15:48.629
We haven't spoken about it specifically,
I just know they do.

01:15:48.795 --> 01:15:51.924
Well, what do your daddy do?

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:55.302
He's a butler.

01:15:55.469 --> 01:15:58.639
The black domestic play an
important role in our history.

01:15:58.805 --> 01:16:00.891
I didn't tell you that
to make fun of me.

01:16:01.058 --> 01:16:04.770
Young brother, the black
domestic defy racial stereotypes

01:16:04.937 --> 01:16:08.190
by being hardworking and trustworthy.

01:16:14.112 --> 01:16:15.906
<i>He slowly
tears down racial hatred</i>

01:16:16.073 --> 01:16:22.162
<i>with his example of a strong work ethic
and dignified character.</i>

01:16:25.374 --> 01:16:29.336
Now, while we perceive the butler
or the maid to be subservient,

01:16:29.503 --> 01:16:33.966
in many ways, they are subversive,
without even knowing it.

01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:40.555
- Come in, Cecil.
- Afternoon, Mr. Warner.

01:16:45.102 --> 01:16:46.895
Thank you for seeing me.

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:04.246
Since the colored...

01:17:04.413 --> 01:17:06.456
...the black staff

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:10.043
does just as much work
as the white staff,

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:14.548
I believe that our salaries
should reflect our service, sir.

01:17:16.466 --> 01:17:18.093
"Black" staff?

01:17:19.386 --> 01:17:22.973
I also feel
that we should have...

01:17:24.850 --> 01:17:28.937
...opportunities of advancement.

01:17:29.104 --> 01:17:31.690
No black houseman

01:17:31.857 --> 01:17:35.777
has ever been promoted
to the engineer's office.

01:17:38.071 --> 01:17:40.824
You're very well liked here, Cecil.

01:17:40.991 --> 01:17:42.993
But if you're unhappy
with your salary or position,

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.370
then I suggest you seek
employment elsewhere.

01:17:45.537 --> 01:17:47.539
- With all due respect...
- Don't let that Martin Luther King shit

01:17:47.706 --> 01:17:51.877
fill your britches out.
Just remember where I found you.

01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:01.803
Yes, sir.

01:18:08.435 --> 01:18:09.936
Excuse me.

01:18:18.862 --> 01:18:22.074
<i>Dr. Martin Luther King,
the apostle of non-violence</i>

01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:26.078
<i>in the civil rights movement has been
shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.</i>

01:18:26.244 --> 01:18:28.497
<i>Police have issued
an All Points Bulletin</i>

01:18:28.663 --> 01:18:31.708
<i>for a well-dressed, young white
man seen running from the scene.</i>

01:18:31.875 --> 01:18:34.669
<i>Officers also reportedly
chased and fired on</i>

01:18:34.836 --> 01:18:37.672
<i>a radio-equipped car
containing two white men.</i>

01:19:04.741 --> 01:19:08.578
<i>I didn't know if I was
gonna get home alive.</i>

01:19:10.288 --> 01:19:14.418
<i>It was the first time I felt like
I didn't belong in my own neighborhood.</i>

01:19:16.044 --> 01:19:17.838
<i>The whole world was changing, </i>

01:19:18.004 --> 01:19:20.590
<i>and I didn't know where I fit in.</i>

01:19:22.259 --> 01:19:24.719
<i>Dr. King has been a buffer
the last two years, </i>

01:19:24.886 --> 01:19:27.139
<i>between the black community
and the white community.</i>

01:19:27.305 --> 01:19:28.598
<i>The white people do not know it, </i>

01:19:28.765 --> 01:19:31.435
<i>but the white people's
best friend is dead.</i>

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:34.104
<i>The black people's leader,
our Moses, </i>

01:19:34.271 --> 01:19:37.482
<i>the once in a four-
or five-hundred year leader, </i>

01:19:37.649 --> 01:19:40.152
<i>has been taken from us
by hatred and bitterness.</i>

01:19:40.318 --> 01:19:42.028
<i>Even as I stand at this hour, </i>

01:19:42.195 --> 01:19:46.616
<i>I cannot even allow hate
to enter my heart at this time, </i>

01:19:46.783 --> 01:19:50.203
<i>for it was sickness,
not meanness, that killed him.</i>

01:20:29.618 --> 01:20:32.829
Ma... my room's pink.

01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:41.296
Make sure you get some more
of my sweet potatoes, Carol.

01:20:41.463 --> 01:20:43.340
I use orange juice
when I make 'em,

01:20:43.507 --> 01:20:45.634
that's what make 'em so... tart.

01:20:47.427 --> 01:20:48.595
How long y'all been dating?

01:20:48.762 --> 01:20:50.180
- Five years.
- We're just friends.

01:20:55.727 --> 01:20:58.230
Is, uh,
all the rest of the students

01:20:58.396 --> 01:21:00.482
are they getting involved
in politics, too?

01:21:05.695 --> 01:21:08.448
There's been a division.
Kind of a split, Ma.

01:21:08.615 --> 01:21:11.993
A few of them,
like John Lewis, they're still...

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:15.413
- I love John Lewis.
- How you know who John Lewis is?

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.457
<i>'Cause, honey,
I read Jet magazine.</i>

01:21:17.624 --> 01:21:20.544
I'm not just sitting up there
sewing for you all day.

01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:22.337
Ooh.

01:21:22.504 --> 01:21:25.340
I'm sick and tired of getting
thrown in jail.

01:21:26.258 --> 01:21:27.884
Yeah, well, that makes
two of us, don't it?

01:21:29.928 --> 01:21:32.472
Dr. King's philosophy ultimately
got him murdered.

01:21:32.639 --> 01:21:34.683
It worked when we started,

01:21:34.849 --> 01:21:38.895
but... now it's time to take
the next step, which is politics.

01:21:39.062 --> 01:21:40.647
So y'all going
to the White House now?

01:21:40.814 --> 01:21:42.023
Daddy, Louis going
to the White House.

01:21:42.190 --> 01:21:43.567
You know they ain't gonna
let you in there

01:21:43.733 --> 01:21:45.151
with them nipples out.

01:21:45.318 --> 01:21:47.362
Maybe one, but not both of 'em.

01:21:47.529 --> 01:21:50.991
Shut up. Nah, we're...
we're more grass roots.

01:21:51.157 --> 01:21:53.493
One-on-one with the community.

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.745
Although we have started
our own political party.

01:21:55.912 --> 01:21:58.248
What's your party?

01:21:58.415 --> 01:21:59.791
You like to party?

01:21:59.958 --> 01:22:03.712
I like to party.
What's your party called?

01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:07.632
The Black Panther Party.

01:22:07.799 --> 01:22:12.095
What kind of name is that?
What's that stand for?

01:22:12.262 --> 01:22:14.931
We... provide free breakfast
for children,

01:22:15.098 --> 01:22:19.019
free medical clinics, free clothing,
self-defense classes.

01:22:19.185 --> 01:22:21.438
And why y'all need self-defense?

01:22:21.605 --> 01:22:23.273
We ain't gettin' beat no more.

01:22:28.612 --> 01:22:30.947
Me and your daddy saw a
wonderful movie the other night.

01:22:31.114 --> 01:22:32.741
Reminded me so much of you.

01:22:32.907 --> 01:22:35.327
Oh, yeah?

01:22:35.493 --> 01:22:37.370
What was the name
of that movie, honey?

01:22:37.537 --> 01:22:39.164
<i>In the Heat of the Night.</i>

01:22:40.332 --> 01:22:46.046
<i>In the Heat... of the Night,
with Sidney Poitier.</i>

01:22:46.212 --> 01:22:48.632
Lord, Sidney Poitier.
I love Sidney Poitier.

01:22:48.798 --> 01:22:52.177
Sidney Poitier's a white man's fantasy
of what he wants us to be.

01:22:52.344 --> 01:22:55.847
But his movies have him
fighting for equal rights.

01:22:56.014 --> 01:22:57.891
Only in a way that's acceptable
to the white status quo.

01:22:58.058 --> 01:23:01.936
- Ah.
- The brother can't act.

01:23:02.103 --> 01:23:03.897
What are you talking about?

01:23:04.064 --> 01:23:05.690
He just won the Academy Award.

01:23:05.857 --> 01:23:07.817
He's breaking down barriers
for all of us.

01:23:07.984 --> 01:23:11.821
By being white.
By acting white.

01:23:11.988 --> 01:23:14.574
Sidney Poitier is nothing but
a rich Uncle Tom.

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.954
Look at you.

01:23:20.121 --> 01:23:22.374
All puffed up.

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:24.584
With your hat on your head.

01:23:24.751 --> 01:23:27.212
Coming in here,
saying whatever you want.

01:23:27.379 --> 01:23:28.838
Girlfriend belching at the table.

01:23:30.131 --> 01:23:31.549
You don't even feel
you gotta go to school,

01:23:31.716 --> 01:23:33.718
even though I gave you the money.

01:23:35.303 --> 01:23:37.430
You need to go.

01:23:39.766 --> 01:23:43.395
Yeah, Louis.
I need you to get out of my house.

01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:47.190
- What?
- Get the hell out of my house!

01:23:47.357 --> 01:23:48.775
- What are you doing?
- Get on out!

01:23:48.942 --> 01:23:50.694
- He's gotta go!
- No, Cecil, no!

01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:52.654
- I can't take this no more!
- We ain't seen this boy!

01:23:52.821 --> 01:23:54.072
We ain't seen this boy!

01:23:54.239 --> 01:23:55.407
I'm gonna snatch the life
out of you, boy!

01:23:55.573 --> 01:23:56.991
- Now, everybody just sit down.
- I'm sorry, Mr. Butler,

01:23:57.158 --> 01:23:59.536
I didn't mean to make
fun of your hero.

01:24:01.371 --> 01:24:04.708
Everything you are and
everything you have is...

01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:07.127
...'cause of that butler.

01:24:07.293 --> 01:24:10.547
Now you take that trifling
low-class bitch...

01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:14.926
...and get out of this house.

01:24:30.191 --> 01:24:32.152
I like Sidney Poitier, Daddy.

01:24:34.654 --> 01:24:36.656
<i>What's that movie he did?
Look Who's Coming to Dinner?</i>

01:24:36.823 --> 01:24:38.241
Everything ain't a joke.

01:24:38.408 --> 01:24:40.827
- Carol came to dinner.
- Hush, Charlie.

01:24:43.997 --> 01:24:46.666
<i>Police took Louis the next day.</i>

01:24:53.006 --> 01:24:56.092
Y'all gonna make me late for work.

01:24:56.259 --> 01:24:57.719
Unc, I'm sorry.

01:24:57.886 --> 01:24:59.137
Who else I'm supposed to call
to bail him out?

01:24:59.304 --> 01:25:02.932
What they got him in for this time?
Sit up!

01:25:03.099 --> 01:25:06.686
Louis said they
stopped him just because.

01:25:07.854 --> 01:25:09.856
Just because.

01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:13.318
He said he wasn't going
to get beat no more, so...

01:25:13.485 --> 01:25:16.112
...he got out the car
and he hit 'em back.

01:25:16.279 --> 01:25:18.406
What about that little gal of his?

01:25:19.365 --> 01:25:21.743
They put her in the hospital.

01:25:21.910 --> 01:25:23.286
The hospital.

01:25:23.453 --> 01:25:25.246
Charlie.

01:25:25.413 --> 01:25:27.665
This shit's gotta stop, man.

01:25:30.084 --> 01:25:32.045
I'm late for work.

01:25:32.212 --> 01:25:34.130
You tell Louis I'm not his mama.

01:25:34.297 --> 01:25:36.716
I want my money back.

01:25:40.094 --> 01:25:41.971
You all right?

01:25:42.138 --> 01:25:43.640
Yeah, I'm all right.

01:25:44.933 --> 01:25:47.101
Thanks, Uncle Carter.

01:25:47.268 --> 01:25:49.938
You need to take all this Black
Panther shit somewhere else.

01:25:50.104 --> 01:25:52.941
Now, I'm not them.
I want my money back, hear me?

01:25:53.107 --> 01:25:55.401
- Yes, sir.
- Every dime.

01:25:57.028 --> 01:26:01.199
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, Unc... don't tell Daddy.

01:26:08.915 --> 01:26:12.418
How you avoid all that sex
in prison?

01:26:12.585 --> 01:26:14.629
Do they teach you that
with the Panthers?

01:26:14.796 --> 01:26:18.383
They teach you how to... to sit...

01:26:23.429 --> 01:26:27.392
- She been drinking again?
- No. She's sober.

01:26:27.559 --> 01:26:30.812
She ain't doing nothing but sewing
and feeding them damn fishes.

01:26:30.979 --> 01:26:33.356
Feed them more than she feed me.

01:26:34.399 --> 01:26:36.860
You excited about
going back to Howard?

01:26:37.026 --> 01:26:39.529
Excited about not going back.

01:26:40.822 --> 01:26:43.157
- What?
- Yeah.

01:26:43.324 --> 01:26:45.535
I'm going to Vietnam.

01:26:45.702 --> 01:26:48.705
Charlie, don't do this.
Don't do this.

01:26:48.872 --> 01:26:52.834
- This country treats us like dogs!
- And do what? Don't do this?

01:26:54.878 --> 01:26:58.548
You fight your country.

01:26:58.715 --> 01:27:01.092
I want to fight for my country.

01:27:01.259 --> 01:27:04.429
- I won't go to your funeral.
- Good.

01:27:04.596 --> 01:27:07.682
'Cause I don't want you there
with all of that...

01:27:08.349 --> 01:27:12.562
...black leather and latex,

01:27:12.729 --> 01:27:17.025
shining and taking away the attention
off of my pretty face in my casket.

01:27:20.403 --> 01:27:22.614
What do they call you now, Louise?

01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:24.407
- Shut up.
- Louise Gaines.

01:27:24.574 --> 01:27:25.700
Charlie, shut up.

01:27:26.075 --> 01:27:29.871
I want to know every goddamn
domestic policy decision right now,

01:27:30.038 --> 01:27:31.372
and I want it on the table right now.

01:27:31.539 --> 01:27:32.540
- OK.
- OK.

01:27:32.707 --> 01:27:34.834
Did you get
the memos we sent last week?

01:27:35.001 --> 01:27:39.172
John and I strongly agree
that the time calls for...

01:27:39.339 --> 01:27:41.090
A goddamn fly,
a goddamn fly in here.

01:27:41.257 --> 01:27:42.926
- Jesus Christ.
- John and I both think

01:27:43.092 --> 01:27:46.512
that the time calls for
a period of benign neglect.

01:27:46.679 --> 01:27:47.847
- Benign neglect.
- Yes.

01:27:48.014 --> 01:27:50.475
I like that. I like that.

01:27:50.642 --> 01:27:54.145
<i>You know, the pigs in the
media describe us as terrorists.</i>

01:27:54.312 --> 01:27:58.650
A terrorist is one who
terrorizes and frightens others.

01:27:58.816 --> 01:28:01.361
We the ones getting terrorized.

01:28:01.527 --> 01:28:03.446
How can we exist in, in peace,

01:28:03.613 --> 01:28:06.658
when we scared to walk
down the street to the store?

01:28:06.824 --> 01:28:09.202
All right, there's this whole black
power movement going on, right?

01:28:09.369 --> 01:28:12.205
- Right.
- What if we, um...

01:28:16.376 --> 01:28:18.503
What if Nixon promotes black power

01:28:18.670 --> 01:28:22.548
to mean "black businesses"
and we find ways to support

01:28:22.715 --> 01:28:26.094
black entrepreneurs, pass the buck
on desegregation to the courts.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:28.805
Push black enterprise

01:28:28.972 --> 01:28:30.723
to win the 20 percent
of the votes it could swing our way.

01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:32.976
- Excellent, sir.
- Absolutely.

01:28:33.142 --> 01:28:35.311
You don't know if your ceiling gonna
cave in 'cause your slum lord

01:28:35.478 --> 01:28:37.981
too busy running around
collecting rent checks.

01:28:38.147 --> 01:28:40.024
But he won't fix your roof.

01:28:40.191 --> 01:28:43.820
It's time we take a stand
against these injustices

01:28:43.987 --> 01:28:45.488
that have plagued our community.

01:28:45.655 --> 01:28:49.200
They take one of ours,
we taking two of theirs.

01:28:49.367 --> 01:28:50.994
- That's right.
- It's been time.

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.913
We just need to make sure
that Nixon black power

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.999
doesn't equate Nixon
with the Black Panthers.

01:28:56.165 --> 01:28:58.835
Have you lost your mind, man?
Did you read Hoover's last memo on that?

01:28:59.002 --> 01:29:01.170
- That's my point.
- Goddamn terrifying.

01:29:01.337 --> 01:29:03.756
No, no, no. I gave him the green light
to gut those sons of bitches.

01:29:03.923 --> 01:29:05.258
- Good.
- Good. Absolutely.

01:29:05.425 --> 01:29:07.969
No, round 'em all up and
throw 'em down an elevator shaft.

01:29:10.555 --> 01:29:14.517
I don't proclaim to know everything.
But I promise you...

01:29:15.435 --> 01:29:17.979
...they'll always beware
of the nigger with a gun.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.694
Will there be anything else,
Mr. President?

01:29:35.788 --> 01:29:38.291
How many kids we got coming
to the breakfast tomorrow morning?

01:29:38.458 --> 01:29:40.460
Got about 25 to 30 coming.

01:29:40.626 --> 01:29:43.046
Twenty-five to 30 kids
will be able to go to school

01:29:43.212 --> 01:29:45.131
and focus on their lessons.

01:29:45.298 --> 01:29:47.717
'Cause they don't want us
to be able to feed our kids.

01:29:47.884 --> 01:29:51.220
They don't want us
to be able to protect ourselves.

01:29:57.977 --> 01:29:59.687
What are we doing here?

01:30:01.731 --> 01:30:04.400
Thought this was going to be
our community service.

01:30:04.567 --> 01:30:07.111
This is community service.

01:30:07.278 --> 01:30:09.655
"Someone kills one of ours,
we kill two of theirs?"

01:30:09.822 --> 01:30:11.491
Community protection.

01:30:11.657 --> 01:30:15.244
Are you ready to kill somebody, Carol?

01:30:16.996 --> 01:30:19.082
'Cause I ain't.

01:30:20.583 --> 01:30:22.752
I am.

01:30:29.425 --> 01:30:31.344
Did you ever love me, baby?

01:30:56.994 --> 01:31:00.081
<i>Today, a day after police
shot it out with the Black Panthers, </i>

01:31:00.248 --> 01:31:02.291
<i>killing two of them,
they raided the apartment...</i>

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:04.377
<i>...the shooting of 26
Panthers in the past year, </i>

01:31:04.544 --> 01:31:07.797
<i>may represent a national campaign
by police to wipe out the Panthers...</i>

01:31:07.964 --> 01:31:10.216
<i>...the criminal reaction
of the occupants in shooting</i>

01:31:10.383 --> 01:31:12.510
<i>at announced police officers, </i>

01:31:12.677 --> 01:31:17.431
<i>emphasizes the extreme viciousness
of the Black Panther Party.</i>

01:31:45.543 --> 01:31:47.128
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

01:31:47.295 --> 01:31:49.297
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday to me, huh?

01:31:49.463 --> 01:31:50.756
Happy birthday to you.

01:31:53.926 --> 01:31:55.720
Right now, this is the present
I want, right here.

01:31:55.887 --> 01:31:58.181
Well, you want it right here?

01:31:58.347 --> 01:32:00.266
Mm-mm, you know right...

01:32:00.433 --> 01:32:02.185
- Right here?
- Kids up... Kids down...?

01:32:02.351 --> 01:32:04.312
Ain't no kids in the house no more.

01:32:04.478 --> 01:32:06.230
Hey, I made you a birthday cake.

01:32:06.397 --> 01:32:08.357
I got all the cake
I want right here.

01:32:08.524 --> 01:32:10.234
No, you crazy.

01:32:10.401 --> 01:32:13.237
I got some champagne
cooling in the icebox.

01:32:13.404 --> 01:32:15.198
And some ice cream, too.
Get some ice cream.

01:32:15.364 --> 01:32:16.782
You gonna be drinking with me?

01:32:18.201 --> 01:32:20.036
You know I don't drink.

01:32:20.203 --> 01:32:22.038
I don't drink.

01:32:22.205 --> 01:32:23.539
Just playing with you.

01:32:23.706 --> 01:32:25.708
I just want to see you move
a little bit. Go ahead.

01:32:27.251 --> 01:32:30.379
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:32:37.345 --> 01:32:39.513
We get any mail
from Charlie today?

01:32:41.474 --> 01:32:43.059
No.

01:32:44.644 --> 01:32:46.312
- No?
- Haven't heard from Charlie.

01:32:46.479 --> 01:32:48.439
I know. I got an idea.

01:32:48.606 --> 01:32:50.691
I think we should go
to Shantay's tonight.

01:32:50.858 --> 01:32:52.944
Oh, no.
No, I'm too old for disco.

01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:54.278
We not old. Come on. We ain't old.

01:32:54.445 --> 01:32:56.155
I just don't feel like
doing no disco.

01:32:56.322 --> 01:32:58.074
Our boys are gone.
It's just you and me.

01:32:58.241 --> 01:33:02.119
You and me, we are free.
I forgot this. I forgot this.

01:33:03.454 --> 01:33:08.376
Now, look at us.
Little happy birthday present.

01:33:10.002 --> 01:33:11.796
I want you to go put it on, upstairs.

01:33:11.963 --> 01:33:13.881
- Put it on?
- Yeah. Go put it on.

01:33:14.048 --> 01:33:15.800
- All right.
- Make it snappy.

01:33:15.967 --> 01:33:18.219
Bring down my sewing kit,
'cause I need to do some alterations.

01:33:22.348 --> 01:33:24.642
Make it snappy!

01:33:28.562 --> 01:33:30.523
Hello.

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:34.819
Hi. Where are you?

01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:37.488
Where?

01:33:38.698 --> 01:33:40.866
You should call me back,
because this is not a good time.

01:33:41.033 --> 01:33:44.161
- He's home again.
- It fit!

01:33:44.328 --> 01:33:45.830
- We gonna go on out tonight.
- Where?

01:33:45.997 --> 01:33:47.915
- He's home and...
- Boy, you good, aren't you?

01:33:48.082 --> 01:33:50.751
- You all right?
- Who that?

01:33:50.918 --> 01:33:53.004
Call me back.

01:33:53.170 --> 01:33:55.047
- OK?
- Oh, it's Louis.

01:33:55.214 --> 01:33:56.799
He asking for some money?

01:33:59.343 --> 01:34:00.886
Hey, Louis.

01:34:02.346 --> 01:34:04.223
I didn't expect to hear
from you on my birthday.

01:34:05.308 --> 01:34:07.226
You should feel
ashamed of yourself.

01:34:07.393 --> 01:34:10.104
You're a grown-ass man calling
your mama, asking for money.

01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:12.815
And guess what?
It's the butler's money.

01:34:12.982 --> 01:34:14.525
It's Uncle Tom's money.

01:34:14.692 --> 01:34:16.736
And he ain't giving
none out today.

01:34:18.362 --> 01:34:19.864
Bye.

01:34:23.492 --> 01:34:25.077
I got it.

01:34:36.213 --> 01:34:37.882
You got the wrong house.

01:34:43.220 --> 01:34:44.805
It's the wrong house.

01:35:42.488 --> 01:35:45.157
<i>Vietnam took my boy, </i>

01:35:45.324 --> 01:35:48.828
<i>and I didn't understand why we
were there in the first place.</i>

01:36:21.485 --> 01:36:23.571
Your father still alive, Cecil?

01:36:25.197 --> 01:36:27.158
No, sir.

01:36:27.324 --> 01:36:29.618
My father died when I was a child.

01:36:36.834 --> 01:36:41.505
Is there anything else that you
would like, Mr. President?

01:36:41.672 --> 01:36:43.632
Yeah. Come sit.

01:36:43.799 --> 01:36:45.593
Sit down, you know?

01:37:04.487 --> 01:37:07.698
There's been a lot of talk
of me resigning and...

01:37:08.574 --> 01:37:10.534
...things of that nature,
but I just want you to know

01:37:10.701 --> 01:37:12.453
it's never gonna happen.

01:37:14.205 --> 01:37:16.749
I'm gonna come out of this thing
stronger than ever.

01:37:24.089 --> 01:37:26.717
Is there anything else
that you would like...

01:37:26.884 --> 01:37:28.344
...Mr. President?

01:37:35.226 --> 01:37:37.561
Louis is here, looking for you.

01:37:42.233 --> 01:37:45.611
- Got everybody all worried.
- Well, I finished school.

01:37:45.778 --> 01:37:46.987
I got my master's
in political science.

01:37:47.154 --> 01:37:50.115
Hey! That's what I'm talking about.

01:37:50.282 --> 01:37:52.576
Get that education.

01:37:52.743 --> 01:37:56.747
There he is!
Well, I'm gonna let you all to it.

01:37:56.914 --> 01:37:59.250
Ain't no need for that, Carter.

01:38:01.001 --> 01:38:04.713
- Hey, Dad.
- Get out of here, Louis.

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:11.804
- Dad...
- I said leave.

01:38:20.479 --> 01:38:22.189
Keep doing what you doing.

01:38:24.733 --> 01:38:27.820
Thank you, Uncle Carter.

01:38:30.072 --> 01:38:33.534
Why you do that? Huh?
That was wrong.

01:38:33.701 --> 01:38:36.412
That boy's hurting, too. He's just
trying to get his act together.

01:38:36.579 --> 01:38:38.789
He should be hurting, Carter.

01:38:39.790 --> 01:38:42.751
Boy didn't even go
to his own brother's funeral.

01:38:43.752 --> 01:38:48.632
He's full of shit is what he is.
He ain't doing nothing right.

01:38:48.799 --> 01:38:51.635
He just got his master's!
What more you want him to do?

01:38:51.802 --> 01:38:56.056
Every gray hair I have
is 'cause of that boy.

01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:09.945
<i>The years started to drift by, </i>

01:39:10.112 --> 01:39:13.699
<i>but the pain in my heart
never went away.</i>

01:39:22.875 --> 01:39:27.087
<i>Through it all,
Louis and I never spoke.</i>

01:39:31.508 --> 01:39:36.138
<i>As we are a nation under God,
so I am sworn...</i>

01:39:56.575 --> 01:39:57.826
<i>Half of our
oil is now imported...</i>

01:39:57.993 --> 01:40:00.037
<i>It is a crisis that strikes
at the very hear':</i>

01:40:00.204 --> 01:40:02.456
<i>and soul and spirit
of our national will.</i>

01:40:02.623 --> 01:40:04.291
<i>- I feel one coming now.
- Not to worry.</i>

01:40:04.458 --> 01:40:06.126
<i>Two of you,
stay home until you feel better.</i>

01:40:06.293 --> 01:40:10.589
<i>OK, Barn, I'll stay.
But I ain't never gonna feel no better.</i>

01:40:19.139 --> 01:40:22.976
<i>In our district alone,
we have nine percent unemployment.</i>

01:40:23.143 --> 01:40:25.771
<i>In the country at large, 14 percent
are living below the poverty line.</i>

01:40:25.938 --> 01:40:29.149
<i>Sixty percent of those
are either black or Hispanic.</i>

01:40:29.316 --> 01:40:31.985
<i>Now, if I'm voted to Congress,
reducing those figures is gonna be</i>

01:40:32.152 --> 01:40:35.280
one of my primary objectives.

01:40:38.826 --> 01:40:40.327
Yeah?

01:40:40.494 --> 01:40:42.246
Oh, hey.

01:40:42.413 --> 01:40:44.164
Thanks for getting back to me.

01:40:48.293 --> 01:40:50.087
How much did he lose by?

01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:55.926
Really?

01:40:56.093 --> 01:40:57.720
All right, then.

01:40:57.886 --> 01:40:59.680
I appreciate it.

01:41:04.643 --> 01:41:06.562
No, he didn't win.

01:41:08.439 --> 01:41:10.691
I think you should call him.

01:41:12.985 --> 01:41:15.988
Right after Charlie passed,

01:41:16.155 --> 01:41:18.657
Louis came over
and paid me a visit.

01:41:18.824 --> 01:41:20.451
Hmm.

01:41:22.035 --> 01:41:25.456
He found me on the kitchen floor.

01:41:25.622 --> 01:41:27.875
I had passed out.

01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:30.043
Drunk.

01:41:30.210 --> 01:41:33.922
I'd gone to the bathroom
all over myself.

01:41:37.050 --> 01:41:39.428
He's the one that cleaned me up.

01:41:42.765 --> 01:41:46.727
And then he told me
I was the best mother

01:41:46.894 --> 01:41:49.688
anybody could ever want.

01:41:52.983 --> 01:41:55.277
I think, about now...

01:41:57.070 --> 01:41:59.948
...he'd want to hear from his daddy.

01:42:01.867 --> 01:42:03.994
I think you ought to call him.

01:42:08.957 --> 01:42:10.626
Mm-hm.

01:42:10.793 --> 01:42:11.794
Cecil?

01:42:14.254 --> 01:42:15.255
Cecil?

01:42:15.422 --> 01:42:18.175
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

01:42:18.342 --> 01:42:20.177
You stay there, I'm coming to you.

01:42:20.344 --> 01:42:23.889
I... have a...

01:42:24.056 --> 01:42:26.683
...secret mission for you.

01:42:26.850 --> 01:42:28.143
Yes, sir.

01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:30.604
I like to send people
money when they write me

01:42:30.771 --> 01:42:32.940
about their financial problems,

01:42:33.106 --> 01:42:37.110
but my staff has been
trying to get me to stop.

01:42:37.277 --> 01:42:41.031
You think you could
help me to keep this going?

01:42:41.198 --> 01:42:43.951
Absolutely, Mr. President.

01:42:44.117 --> 01:42:46.703
Well, I appreciate
your help with this.

01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:49.581
And, please, don't tell Nancy.

01:42:49.748 --> 01:42:51.500
Of course not.

01:42:55.337 --> 01:42:58.423
- Morning, Cecil.
- Morning, Mr. Warner.

01:43:02.845 --> 01:43:04.638
May I sit down?

01:43:13.313 --> 01:43:16.692
I've been here
for over 20 years now.

01:43:19.653 --> 01:43:24.491
For all that time,
the black help

01:43:24.658 --> 01:43:28.954
has been paid a smaller salary
than the white help.

01:43:30.914 --> 01:43:34.418
And I just don't think
that's right, Mr. Warner.

01:43:36.670 --> 01:43:42.301
There are black housemen
who should be engineers by now.

01:43:43.677 --> 01:43:46.805
They should've been promoted
years ago.

01:43:49.308 --> 01:43:51.101
You think so?

01:43:53.979 --> 01:43:59.651
I'm gonna have to be paid
the same as the white help,

01:43:59.818 --> 01:44:03.071
or I'm gonna have to move on.

01:44:04.781 --> 01:44:07.242
I guess you'll be moving on then.

01:44:11.371 --> 01:44:14.666
I told the president
that you'd say that.

01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:21.340
He told me to tell you
to take this up with him, personally.

01:44:25.677 --> 01:44:27.095
Excuse me.

01:44:35.771 --> 01:44:38.315
I'm not comfortable
with all the foreign policy hawks

01:44:38.482 --> 01:44:40.025
surrounding Ronnie, Jim.

01:44:40.192 --> 01:44:44.363
We need more moderates on his staff.
And a summit with the Russians.

01:44:44.529 --> 01:44:46.698
Ronnie has to meet
with them face to face

01:44:46.865 --> 01:44:48.200
if we're ever
going to thaw this ice.

01:44:48.367 --> 01:44:50.869
- Cecil.
- Yes, Mrs. Reagan?

01:44:51.036 --> 01:44:53.705
We will talk, Jim. Yes.

01:44:53.872 --> 01:44:55.540
Yes, ma'am?

01:44:55.707 --> 01:44:57.960
You're very popular around here.

01:44:58.126 --> 01:45:02.547
Everyone says you're the man
that got them raises and promotions.

01:45:02.714 --> 01:45:06.426
- I had no idea.
- I wish I could take credit for that.

01:45:07.177 --> 01:45:09.763
I'd like to invite you
to the State Dinner next week.

01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:12.307
- I'm gonna be there, Mrs. Reagan.
- No.

01:45:12.474 --> 01:45:17.229
Not as a... Not as a butler, Cecil.
I'm inviting you as a guest.

01:45:18.188 --> 01:45:21.358
But the president prefers
for me to serve him personally.

01:45:22.359 --> 01:45:25.404
Don't you worry about, Ronnie.
I'll take care of that.

01:45:26.279 --> 01:45:29.950
So we'll see you next week.
You and your wife.

01:45:30.117 --> 01:45:31.952
My Wife?

01:45:34.955 --> 01:45:37.916
It's... It's Gloria, yes?

01:45:38.083 --> 01:45:40.627
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes.

01:45:42.754 --> 01:45:44.089
Hmm.

01:45:56.935 --> 01:45:58.770
Here's the Entrance Hall.

01:46:03.108 --> 01:46:04.860
Beautiful.

01:46:20.083 --> 01:46:22.711
Can I get you a glass
of champagne, Mr. Gaines?

01:46:22.878 --> 01:46:26.715
- Shut up.
- Right.

01:46:28.717 --> 01:46:30.343
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:46:30.510 --> 01:46:33.972
the President and First Lady
of the United States.

01:46:55.285 --> 01:46:58.997
<i>It was different sitting
at the table instead of serving it.</i>

01:46:59.164 --> 01:47:00.582
<i>Real different.</i>

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:06.630
<i>I could see the two faces
the butlers wore to survive.</i>

01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:12.385
<i>And I knew I'd lived my life
with those same two faces.</i>

01:47:18.934 --> 01:47:24.189
<i>Gloria looked so happy,
but I didn't feel the same way.</i>

01:47:24.356 --> 01:47:28.276
<i>I guess I wished we were there
for real instead of for show.</i>

01:47:38.703 --> 01:47:41.289
I think that's bon appétit, everybody.

01:47:41.456 --> 01:47:42.833
You black mother...

01:47:48.797 --> 01:47:53.009
I want to make myself clear
on this issue.

01:47:54.803 --> 01:48:01.226
If Congress passes sanctions
against South Africa,

01:48:01.393 --> 01:48:05.689
I will be forced to
veto those sanctions.

01:48:05.856 --> 01:48:10.026
Well, Mr. President, we feel
that that would be a major mistake.

01:48:10.193 --> 01:48:13.905
The brutal repression
of South African black citizens

01:48:14.072 --> 01:48:16.867
makes this no longer
a foreign policy issue,

01:48:17.033 --> 01:48:20.620
but a United States racial issue.

01:48:20.787 --> 01:48:23.540
We're senators
from your own party.

01:48:23.707 --> 01:48:25.667
That's why we feel so comfortable
in letting you know

01:48:25.834 --> 01:48:28.879
that South Africa
is a human rights disaster.

01:48:29.045 --> 01:48:32.591
Black people are
being beaten, tortured,

01:48:32.757 --> 01:48:34.759
gunned down
in the middle of the street.

01:48:34.926 --> 01:48:38.680
Americans see all this on TV,
they're horrified by apartheid.

01:48:38.847 --> 01:48:41.558
I've made my decision.

01:48:41.725 --> 01:48:46.188
Mr. President, your reputation
as a world leader is at stake.

01:48:46.354 --> 01:48:48.732
United States of America needs to be

01:48:48.899 --> 01:48:51.067
on the right side of history
on the race issue.

01:48:51.234 --> 01:48:52.819
I say again.

01:48:54.237 --> 01:48:58.158
If Congress passes this bill,

01:48:58.325 --> 01:49:00.994
I Will veto it.

01:49:01.161 --> 01:49:02.829
Period.

01:49:12.297 --> 01:49:16.134
What? You reading now?

01:49:16.301 --> 01:49:18.720
Get up and do the dishes
'fore I shoot your little ass.

01:49:32.567 --> 01:49:36.404
<i>Nothing seemed right to me
after that State Dinner.</i>

01:49:36.571 --> 01:49:38.782
<i>Got all confused.</i>

01:50:05.517 --> 01:50:08.436
<i>They had started writing books</i>

01:50:08.603 --> 01:50:12.899
<i>about everything Louis
and his friends had done.</i>

01:50:18.321 --> 01:50:20.657
<i>Louis was never a criminal.</i>

01:50:24.536 --> 01:50:27.872
<i>He was a hero, </i>

01:50:28.039 --> 01:50:31.376
<i>fighting to save
the soul of our country.</i>

01:50:42.554 --> 01:50:45.390
- Would you like a cookie?
- Thank you, sir.

01:50:45.557 --> 01:50:47.350
- Cookies.
- Thank you.

01:50:47.517 --> 01:50:48.935
Cookie?

01:50:49.102 --> 01:50:51.062
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:50:51.229 --> 01:50:52.689
Thank you.

01:50:52.856 --> 01:50:53.982
Cookie?

01:51:08.788 --> 01:51:14.044
<i>I had always loved sewing.
But just felt different now.</i>

01:51:17.505 --> 01:51:21.968
<i>I didn't know that an old man
could feel so lost.</i>

01:51:22.886 --> 01:51:24.679
<i>That's how I felt.</i>

01:51:25.972 --> 01:51:27.891
<i>That's how I felt.</i>

01:51:34.647 --> 01:51:36.733
<i>Americans always turned</i>

01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:41.780
<i>a blind eye to what we'd done
to our own.</i>

01:51:41.946 --> 01:51:45.742
<i>We look out to the world
and judge.</i>

01:51:45.909 --> 01:51:48.870
<i>We hear about
the concentration camps, </i>

01:51:49.037 --> 01:51:54.000
<i>but these camps went on
for 200 years</i>

01:51:54.167 --> 01:51:56.920
<i>right here in America.</i>

01:52:09.140 --> 01:52:11.267
Buried my daddy right over there.

01:52:15.563 --> 01:52:19.609
My mama would've been
right proud of me,

01:52:19.776 --> 01:52:22.570
being with a man like you's.

01:52:22.737 --> 01:52:26.116
Taking such good care of me
all of these years.

01:52:29.077 --> 01:52:31.121
I love you, Cecil Gaines.

01:52:33.665 --> 01:52:36.000
I love you more, Gloria.

01:52:48.471 --> 01:52:51.891
Are you sure about this?

01:52:52.058 --> 01:52:53.810
Yes, sir.

01:52:53.977 --> 01:52:58.815
I just want to be the one
to tell you first, that's all.

01:52:58.982 --> 01:53:01.568
But you're the best butler here.

01:53:01.734 --> 01:53:04.195
You're like family, Cecil.

01:53:06.197 --> 01:53:08.783
Been an honor serving you.

01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:13.163
Well, not just for me,
I'm sure I speak for all the presidents

01:53:13.329 --> 01:53:17.500
when I say that you've
served your country well.

01:53:19.794 --> 01:53:21.546
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:53:26.468 --> 01:53:27.927
Cecil?

01:53:30.054 --> 01:53:32.682
This whole civil rights issue...

01:53:36.311 --> 01:53:39.439
I sometimes fear I'm...

01:53:39.606 --> 01:53:42.150
on the wrong side of it,
that I'm...

01:53:43.276 --> 01:53:45.361
...just wrong.

01:53:45.528 --> 01:53:49.449
Sometimes I think I'm just
scared of what it really means.

01:53:51.743 --> 01:53:54.579
But I'm trying not to be
so scared anymore.

01:53:55.371 --> 01:53:57.999
<i>- Who do we want to free?!
- Mandela!</i>

01:53:58.166 --> 01:53:59.375
When do we want him free?

01:53:59.542 --> 01:54:00.877
- Now!
- Free Mandela!

01:54:01.044 --> 01:54:05.548
Twenty years ago, we marched
in this country for our rights.

01:54:07.717 --> 01:54:11.638
Today, we march to free
the people of South Africa.

01:54:11.804 --> 01:54:13.181
Yeah!

01:54:13.348 --> 01:54:17.894
Ronald Reagan has attacked or dismantled
every civil rights program

01:54:18.061 --> 01:54:20.063
that has ever been put in place.

01:54:20.230 --> 01:54:21.606
- Yeah!
- Right!

01:54:21.773 --> 01:54:25.443
Aiding the oppression of black South
Africans is absolutely consistent

01:54:25.610 --> 01:54:29.113
with his policies on race issues.
Am I right?

01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:31.699
- Am I right?
- Yes!

01:54:33.701 --> 01:54:35.578
Hold on, hold on.

01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:39.832
Excuse me. Steven?
Where's Steven?

01:54:39.999 --> 01:54:41.834
- Free Mandela!
- Free Mandela, y'all!

01:54:42.001 --> 01:54:43.836
Free Mandela!

01:54:45.588 --> 01:54:50.426
Free Mandela!
Free Mandela! Free Mandela!

01:55:00.937 --> 01:55:03.189
Hi, Dad.

01:55:03.356 --> 01:55:05.692
Hi, Louis.

01:55:07.443 --> 01:55:10.446
What are you doing here?

01:55:15.868 --> 01:55:18.580
I came here to protest with you.

01:55:21.708 --> 01:55:24.294
You'll get arrested, Dad.
You'll lose your job.

01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:28.715
I lost you.

01:55:32.635 --> 01:55:34.470
I'm sorry.

01:55:44.647 --> 01:55:47.483
I'm sorry, son.

01:56:06.711 --> 01:56:10.423
Don't worry, Dad, we'll be
out of here in a few hours.

01:56:10.590 --> 01:56:12.800
Who said I was worried?

01:56:17.555 --> 01:56:21.976
<i>After going to jail,
I thought I'd seen it all.</i>

01:56:22.352 --> 01:56:26.105
- You OK, Daddy?
- Yeah, no, no, no. I'm good.

01:56:26.272 --> 01:56:29.734
<i>But I never imagined I'd see...</i>

01:56:29.901 --> 01:56:31.986
<i>...a black man</i>

01:56:32.153 --> 01:56:37.075
<i>be a real contender for
the President of the United States.</i>

01:56:41.454 --> 01:56:43.498
Here we go.

01:56:43.665 --> 01:56:47.418
- It's that sweet corn.
- That corn look good.

01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:03.518
<i>Gloria and I would walk
to our polling place</i>

01:57:03.685 --> 01:57:08.731
<i>every night to see where
we'd be voting for Barack Obama.</i>

01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:14.529
<i>We'd just... stare at it, smile.</i>

01:57:20.368 --> 01:57:23.413
- You done?
- Pretty much.

01:57:23.579 --> 01:57:25.790
Good. Time to go.

01:57:27.291 --> 01:57:30.002
You done pretty good there.

01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:32.088
Thanks, honey.

01:57:33.423 --> 01:57:37.468
How come Louis' wife
named that child...

01:57:37.635 --> 01:57:40.471
- ...Shaquanda?
- Now, don't start that again.

01:57:40.638 --> 01:57:44.892
I ain't starting it, I just don't know
what kind of name that is.

01:57:45.059 --> 01:57:48.563
I mean, really! Shaquanda?

01:57:48.730 --> 01:57:50.732
I think she done that just to spite me.

01:57:50.898 --> 01:57:54.652
Ain't nobody
done nothing to spite you.

01:57:54.819 --> 01:57:56.738
Yes, she did.

01:57:58.531 --> 01:58:02.118
She a ugly little old girl, too.
That little pug nose.

01:58:02.285 --> 01:58:06.372
- I hope she grow out of it.
- Now, you need to stop that.

01:58:06.539 --> 01:58:08.416
- You know that ain't right.
- Don't you think

01:58:08.583 --> 01:58:10.460
she look a little like
Louis around the mouth?

01:58:10.626 --> 01:58:14.589
I think... she look just like you.

01:58:14.756 --> 01:58:16.591
- Like me?
- Yeah, so you need to...

01:58:16.758 --> 01:58:19.510
...you need
to stop talking about her.

01:58:19.677 --> 01:58:22.680
Let me look at her again,
then, real good.

01:58:25.141 --> 01:58:30.396
She do look a little bit like me.
She a pretty little thing.

01:58:31.731 --> 01:58:34.567
I guess I can put up
with the name Shaquanda.

01:58:36.152 --> 01:58:39.238
I forgot where I put my Bible.

01:58:39.405 --> 01:58:43.117
- You know I need my Bible.
- Mm-hm.

01:58:43.284 --> 01:58:46.871
- I think I left it in the bathroom.
- Why is Louis late?

01:58:48.289 --> 01:58:51.209
Boy gets elected to Congress...

01:58:51.375 --> 01:58:54.754
...and he ain't been on time
getting us to church ever since.

01:58:54.921 --> 01:58:58.883
- I can't believe you still... fussing.
- He gonna be late to his own funeral.

01:58:59.050 --> 01:59:00.718
Are you still fussing
about Louis?

01:59:00.885 --> 01:59:03.596
He said he's gonna be here for us.

01:59:03.763 --> 01:59:07.225
- Go ahead, call him.
- I ain't calling Louis.

01:59:08.100 --> 01:59:11.062
I'm gonna get my purse and...

01:59:15.191 --> 01:59:18.486
What'd you say? Isaiah?

01:59:18.653 --> 01:59:22.198
I see you got... your mark here.

01:59:24.033 --> 01:59:26.160
I'm gonna fall all over myself.

01:59:26.327 --> 01:59:29.247
Baby, you need...
to move that to the other side.

01:59:42.635 --> 01:59:44.428
Baby?

01:59:47.181 --> 01:59:49.308
Honey?

01:59:52.144 --> 01:59:53.688
You sleeping?

01:59:57.692 --> 01:59:59.277
Baby?

02:00:01.654 --> 02:00:03.573
Are you all right?

02:00:28.890 --> 02:00:30.766
<i>...states will be closing, </i>

02:00:30.933 --> 02:00:33.019
<i>and there are some big ones,
especially California, </i>

02:00:33.185 --> 02:00:35.187
<i>the largest state
in the United States, </i>

02:00:35.354 --> 02:00:36.981
<i>with 55 electoral votes.</i>

02:00:37.148 --> 02:00:39.942
<i>Hawaii, that's where
Barack Obama was born.</i>

02:00:40.109 --> 02:00:41.819
<i>will be closing its polls.</i>

02:00:41.986 --> 02:00:45.239
<i>Idaho, Oregon
and Washington state, </i>

02:00:45.406 --> 02:00:47.533
<i>and those states
have been going Democratic</i>

02:00:47.700 --> 02:00:49.827
<i>in presidential contests
in recent years.</i>

02:00:49.994 --> 02:00:51.454
<i>So in a few seconds</i>

02:00:51.621 --> 02:00:53.748
<i>those states
will be closing their polls, </i>

02:00:53.915 --> 02:00:56.500
<i>and presumably we'll
be able to see what's...</i>

02:00:56.667 --> 02:00:58.502
Louis!

02:00:58.669 --> 02:01:00.504
<i>...a major projection at that point.</i>

02:01:00.671 --> 02:01:03.883
<i>This is a moment that a lot of
people have been waiting for...</i>

02:01:04.050 --> 02:01:06.510
Louis, come on down!
Come down!

02:01:06.677 --> 02:01:08.721
<i>...could be rather historic.</i>

02:01:10.598 --> 02:01:14.143
<i>And CNN can now project
that Barack Obama, 47 years old, </i>

02:01:14.310 --> 02:01:16.771
<i>will become the President-Elect</i>

02:01:16.938 --> 02:01:20.024
<i>of the United States. We project...</i>

02:01:20.191 --> 02:01:23.402
<i>If there is anyone out there</i>

02:01:23.569 --> 02:01:27.531
<i>who still doubts that America
is a place where</i>

02:01:27.698 --> 02:01:29.533
<i>all things are possible...</i>

02:01:30.826 --> 02:01:37.208
<i>...who still wonders if the dream of our
founders is alive in our time, </i>

02:01:37.375 --> 02:01:41.462
<i>who still questions
the power of our democracy, </i>

02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:44.006
<i>tonight is your answer.</i>

02:02:49.321 --> 02:02:52.074
<i>You must look
through their eyes...</i>

02:02:54.410 --> 02:02:56.787
<i>...see what it is that they want...</i>

02:02:58.581 --> 02:03:01.292
<i>...see what it is that they need...</i>

02:03:03.210 --> 02:03:05.212
<i>...anticipate...</i>

02:03:08.257 --> 02:03:12.094
...bring a smile
to the principal's eyes.

02:03:20.770 --> 02:03:22.480
Mr. Gaines.

02:03:22.646 --> 02:03:24.982
I'm Admiral Rochon, the chief usher.

02:03:31.238 --> 02:03:35.993
- Nice to meet you, admiral.
- Pleasure's all mine, sir.

02:03:39.330 --> 02:03:42.291
I just wanted to tell you
what an honor it is to meet you, sir.

02:03:43.793 --> 02:03:45.336
The honor is mine.

02:03:45.503 --> 02:03:48.214
The president's so excited
to meet with you.

02:03:49.423 --> 02:03:50.966
Well...

02:03:54.011 --> 02:03:56.514
...that's just fine, isn't it?

02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:58.516
Let me show
you the way.

02:03:58.682 --> 02:04:00.518
I know the way.

02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:06.816
<i>The heart of the question is, </i>

02:04:06.982 --> 02:04:10.152
<i>whether all Americans
are to be afforded equal rights</i>

02:04:10.319 --> 02:04:12.988
<i>and equal opportunities.</i>

02:04:13.155 --> 02:04:19.537
<i>It is the effort of American
Negroes to secure for themselves</i>

02:04:19.703 --> 02:04:24.291
<i>the full blessings of American life.</i>

02:04:24.458 --> 02:04:26.710
<i>We will respond
with that timeless creed</i>

02:04:29.672 --> 02:04:31.507
<i>Yes, we can.</i>
