00:22.022 --> 00:24.257
(kissing)

00:28.461 --> 00:31.331
(clears throat)

00:31.331 --> 00:34.300
Yo, come on, step up.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.102
- You're opening the gate
for me like a gentleman.

00:36.102 --> 00:38.471
You want me to walk
through and thank you

00:38.471 --> 00:40.440
so you can impress her.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.941
It's okay. I'm not impaired

00:41.941 --> 00:43.209
and you're probably
not a gentleman

00:43.209 --> 00:44.411
so just-
(laughs)

00:44.411 --> 00:46.079
- Yo, you got a
problem or somethin'?

00:47.047 --> 00:49.082
- With a con artist like you?

00:49.082 --> 00:50.417
Plenty.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.684
What are you, 22?

00:51.684 --> 00:54.521
It's 3:00, you should be
in college or working.

00:54.521 --> 00:56.056
Obviously neither.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.824
Probably don't use
protection, do you?

00:57.824 --> 01:00.493
You'll knock her up,
provide zero child support,

01:00.493 --> 01:02.228
financially or emotionally.

01:02.228 --> 01:03.763
You're just with her
to get your rocks off

01:03.763 --> 01:06.099
using her vagina for
your prick's pleasure

01:06.099 --> 01:07.901
(laughs) while she
fakes an orgasm

01:07.901 --> 01:09.436
just so you'll stick around.

01:09.436 --> 01:12.338
Meanwhile, you're too timid to
ask that he orally please you

01:12.338 --> 01:14.774
because having your needs met
is not a consideration, right?

01:14.774 --> 01:17.143
- Yo, you better shut your
mouth and keep it moving.

01:17.143 --> 01:18.678
Cause real talk, you
don't know me and--

01:18.678 --> 01:20.647
- You're gonna assault me, huh?

01:20.647 --> 01:21.714
That's the way to
end an argument?

01:21.714 --> 01:23.249
- Lady, lady, lady.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.451
First of all, hold up, you
don't even know him, okay?

01:24.451 --> 01:25.952
Luther has a job.

01:25.952 --> 01:27.687
He works nights, that's why
we're out here right now.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.355
Matter of fact, he works at
the Fullway up the block.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.658
He's a security guard,
so he's a good dude.

01:31.658 --> 01:32.792
- And I know how
to use my tongue

01:32.792 --> 01:35.328
like a goddamn
electric eel.

01:35.328 --> 01:36.396
Word.

01:37.597 --> 01:38.498
- Oh.

01:39.732 --> 01:41.267
I'm sorry.

01:41.267 --> 01:44.037
Sometimes I say things that
I really shouldn't and...

01:44.037 --> 01:45.505
- Bounce.

01:45.505 --> 01:48.041
- Just because he's
a security guard,

01:48.041 --> 01:49.876
doesn't mean that he's
an appropriate companion.

01:49.876 --> 01:51.978
I mean, half the security
guards in New York

01:51.978 --> 01:53.179
have a criminal record.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.082
Have you told her
about your past?

01:58.685 --> 01:59.986
- Luther?

01:59.986 --> 02:01.688
- Yo, this bitch is
fucking crazy, man!

02:01.688 --> 02:03.123
- What do you mean she's crazy?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.457
- Why are we even standing
here talking about--

02:04.457 --> 02:05.291
- It's evident!

02:05.291 --> 02:07.093
He's no match for you.

02:07.093 --> 02:09.729
You probably have a
high school degree

02:09.729 --> 02:12.165
and you're going to
community college.

02:12.165 --> 02:13.633
Nursing is your goal, right?

02:14.434 --> 02:15.702
- How did you know that?

02:15.702 --> 02:17.871
- Because 25 years of
being a social worker,

02:17.871 --> 02:20.206
I see patterns.

02:20.206 --> 02:21.141
Yeah.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.475
And I know you can do better.

02:23.576 --> 02:25.178
You have a tight window
that's open right now

02:25.178 --> 02:28.081
where you can actually
find a really great guy.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.917
Find somebody that has
similar goals that you do,

02:30.917 --> 02:33.486
not some guy who's gonna
spray his sperm around town

02:33.486 --> 02:36.422
and leave you with a baby
and a big bag of bye bye

02:36.422 --> 02:38.324
and that window will slam shut

02:38.324 --> 02:41.594
and all that will be left
are perverts and man-boys

02:41.594 --> 02:43.730
and disappointments that
will make this good dude

02:43.730 --> 02:46.399
who's trying to fuck you in
public look like a priest.

02:46.399 --> 02:47.967
- Hey, yo, bitch, I'm bout to
slap all the shit outta you

02:47.967 --> 02:48.801
- No, no, no!

02:48.801 --> 02:50.436
(shouting)

02:50.436 --> 02:52.572
- What do you mean?

02:52.572 --> 02:53.573
Fuck you, bitch!

02:53.573 --> 02:54.541
And fuck you too.

02:54.541 --> 02:57.210
- What do you mean, fuck me?

02:57.210 --> 02:58.778
What is wrong with you, lady?

02:58.778 --> 02:59.646
- Typical.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.147
- But now he's gone!

03:01.147 --> 03:05.718
- Oh no, I just didn't want
you to be alone like I am

03:05.718 --> 03:07.253
all these years.

03:08.288 --> 03:09.189
Sorry!

03:12.358 --> 03:13.259
Shit.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.529
(calm music)

03:21.401 --> 03:23.536
(kisses)

03:35.715 --> 03:38.218
(chattering)

04:08.014 --> 04:10.149
(sirens)

05:11.311 --> 05:14.047
(phone ringing)

05:16.049 --> 05:18.551
(chattering)

05:29.195 --> 05:31.164
- [Boy] He's insane
in the banana brain!

05:31.164 --> 05:35.134
- Tell me where the delicious
banana brain cereal is hidden

05:35.134 --> 05:38.237
or else the girl gets milked.

05:38.237 --> 05:40.106
(laughs)

05:40.106 --> 05:40.940
- No, please.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.075
I just got this dress.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.244
- Only bananas.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.614
Only bananas...

05:51.451 --> 05:55.621
Only bananas get
milked in the morning.

05:55.621 --> 05:56.723
- Cut, cut, cut!

05:57.790 --> 05:58.925
- Friggin' amateur.

05:58.925 --> 06:01.461
You wanna borrow
my training bra?

06:01.461 --> 06:03.463
- You blow that line
one more time...

06:04.564 --> 06:06.499
(grunts) I'll turn
you into an altar boy.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.603
- Don't treat the kid like that.

06:10.603 --> 06:12.538
- Why didn't you charge
him, shout your line,

06:12.538 --> 06:14.807
and whack his fruity
(mumbles) brains out?

06:14.807 --> 06:15.742
Huh?

06:15.742 --> 06:17.009
Answer me, you little brat.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.479
Why didn't you do that?

06:19.479 --> 06:21.214
- Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.715
Hey, hey, I got it,
I got it, Mitch.

06:22.715 --> 06:23.950
I got it, I got it.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.585
- Fix it, Marty, or
I'm gonna fix him.

06:25.585 --> 06:26.619
- Okay, he's fixed.

06:26.619 --> 06:27.720
Okay, see you.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.521
I get it, man.

06:28.521 --> 06:29.689
Sometimes it feels

06:29.689 --> 06:31.524
like no one's ever
satisfied with you, huh?

06:31.524 --> 06:35.895
like claiming "You don't
appreciate all the sacrifices

06:35.895 --> 06:38.931
You only care about yourself,
you don't care about me."

06:38.931 --> 06:41.134
So what's gonna happen, right?

06:41.134 --> 06:42.835
You, me, you end up
feeling so crappy

06:42.835 --> 06:44.270
that you do whatever you
can to make them happy,

06:44.270 --> 06:45.204
become their servant.

06:45.204 --> 06:46.139
You forget that you have a life.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.039
It'll drive you--

06:48.541 --> 06:50.243
ducking goat nuts.

06:52.645 --> 06:54.313
Okay, I bet you
hate math, right?

06:54.313 --> 06:55.782
Of course.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.284
Well, you see that guy over
there with the mustache?

06:58.284 --> 06:59.218
Like looking away?

06:59.218 --> 07:00.686
Looks a funny man, right?

07:00.686 --> 07:02.088
Well, you don't like that guy.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.857
He is a kid-hating,
homework overloading,

07:04.857 --> 07:07.093
call you out in
the middle of class

07:07.093 --> 07:09.695
when he knows you don't know
the answer math teacher.

07:09.695 --> 07:11.197
I'm talking about
the kind of math

07:11.197 --> 07:13.399
where they tell you letters
or numbers, it makes no sense!

07:13.399 --> 07:15.001
Max, take a stand.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.569
Pick up that spoon,
this is your time.

07:16.569 --> 07:17.804
Do it for the kids.

07:17.804 --> 07:18.905
Do it for the kids
all over the world.

07:18.905 --> 07:20.640
Tell that fun-robbing
hate monster

07:20.640 --> 07:24.510
what time the bananas
get milked around here!

07:24.510 --> 07:25.545
Go, my boy!

07:26.612 --> 07:30.416
- Only bananas get
milked in the morning!

07:30.416 --> 07:32.552
(shouts)

07:37.056 --> 07:37.957
- Fuck.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.298
(knocking)

07:47.366 --> 07:48.968
- I have gun!

07:48.968 --> 07:50.036
Gun.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.204
Gun to shoot.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.773
Go away.

07:53.773 --> 07:58.344
- Mrs. Gonzalez, I'm Judith
Weiss, from the social services.

07:58.344 --> 08:00.913
If you want to continue to
receive state assistance,

08:00.913 --> 08:04.484
you must allow me to
conduct a home inspection.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.384
- Oh.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.689
(laughs) Without the
welfare, I have no home.

08:09.689 --> 08:10.923
Come in, come in, por favor.

08:10.923 --> 08:13.226
- Thank you, thank
you, Mrs. Gonzalez.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.161
Oh, actually cold in here.

08:16.362 --> 08:17.930
How many children do you have?

08:18.998 --> 08:19.899
- I...

08:22.168 --> 08:23.069
Three?

08:24.437 --> 08:27.573
- On your welfare papers,
it says that you have five.

08:27.573 --> 08:28.574
Five children.

08:29.809 --> 08:32.979
Do you want to
reapply for welfare?

08:32.979 --> 08:34.380
- No, no.

08:34.380 --> 08:39.018
Use each of the penny
for five children.

08:39.018 --> 08:39.919
- Okay.

08:40.986 --> 08:44.290
Does Mr. Gonzalez
provide any assistance?

08:44.290 --> 08:47.326
- No hear or see him
in over a year, so no.

08:47.326 --> 08:50.596
- Can you prove to me that
you have five children?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.533
Right?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.333
- Yes!

08:54.333 --> 08:55.167
- Somehow?

08:55.167 --> 08:58.905
- They are playing
with the neighbors.

08:58.905 --> 09:00.072
I will bring them to you.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.207
- Oh, that's really
not necessary.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.075
You can show me their
clothes or their diapers.

09:03.075 --> 09:04.377
- No, keep her company, okay?

09:04.377 --> 09:08.347
I'll be right back.

09:08.347 --> 09:12.351
vamos, vamos, vamos.

09:13.319 --> 09:14.253
See?

09:14.253 --> 09:16.956
These are my five children.

09:21.994 --> 09:22.929
- I see.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.430
Alright, so what is your name?

09:24.430 --> 09:25.331
- Chan Sook.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.769
- Juanita Chan Sook Gonzalez.

09:29.769 --> 09:31.604
- Juanita Chan Sook.

09:31.604 --> 09:32.572
Okay.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.273
And you must be Paco.

09:34.273 --> 09:35.174
- Trey.

09:36.108 --> 09:38.244
(laughs)

09:42.815 --> 09:45.484
(upbeat music)

09:51.190 --> 09:52.091
- Idea!

09:53.926 --> 09:55.027
Talk to me.

09:55.027 --> 09:55.928
Please.

09:55.928 --> 09:56.796
We'll call it...

09:59.599 --> 10:00.833
Squirtgurt.

10:00.833 --> 10:01.734
Togurt.

10:01.734 --> 10:02.568
Twurt.

10:02.568 --> 10:03.869
Do we have Twister?

10:04.804 --> 10:06.272
Twist in the Mouth.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.075
No good, moving on.

10:09.075 --> 10:11.444
If you whist, you whist.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.447
Tort.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.983
The yogurt that gives
you warts, right?

10:16.983 --> 10:22.154
God, why do we need another
fucking yogurt, right?

10:24.056 --> 10:26.559
I'll kill you!

10:26.559 --> 10:27.693
Killgurt.

10:29.161 --> 10:31.731
I'm melting, I'm melting!

10:34.433 --> 10:35.668
- Marty, you killed it.

10:37.236 --> 10:38.204
Nailed it.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.472
Marty, you saved the shoot,

10:39.472 --> 10:41.207
the client thinks
you're a rock star.

10:41.207 --> 10:44.243
- Unbelievable how you get
inside the psychographics

10:44.243 --> 10:45.978
of a preteen demo.

10:45.978 --> 10:48.381
You must have the mind of
an advanced 10 year old.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.583
- Shut the fuck up,
you're just jealous.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.519
Marty, you have just proven
yourself worthy of advance.

10:53.519 --> 10:55.888
- Regardless of
your bipolar record.

10:55.888 --> 10:58.791
- We are shifting you
to a new demographic,

10:58.791 --> 11:00.693
the constipated young adult.

11:01.927 --> 11:02.928
- The adult market?

11:03.729 --> 11:04.764
Constipated adult?

11:04.764 --> 11:06.365
I can go with that.

11:06.365 --> 11:07.967
I mean, it's a start,
right, why not?

11:07.967 --> 11:09.568
Everyone gets constipated
once or twice.

11:09.568 --> 11:10.536
I had an enema once.

11:10.536 --> 11:11.837
But wait, I got it.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.072
How about "Life is full of it

11:13.072 --> 11:15.508
but that doesn't
mean you should be."

11:15.508 --> 11:18.844
- [Summer] Marty,
girlfriend on line one.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.312
- Don't be too literal here.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.849
Midway Investments
is the client.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.818
They're financial, not medical.

11:26.919 --> 11:29.889
I lovingly ascribe
the term constipated

11:29.889 --> 11:32.324
to this particular crop
currently turning 30

11:32.324 --> 11:36.929
because they can't seem to
get off the proverbial pot

11:36.929 --> 11:37.930
of their childhood.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.133
They have careers,
they have money,

11:42.201 --> 11:43.769
but for whatever reason
they seem to lack

11:43.769 --> 11:46.939
the emotional maturity
to let go of their past

11:46.939 --> 11:49.642
and put stock in their futures.

11:50.643 --> 11:51.544
Literally.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.113
- Really good.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.648
- [Summer] Marty,
mom on line two.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.883
- I'm in a very important
meeting, thank you, yep.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.218
Yeah, listening, yeah.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.886
Very attently here.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.989
- It's because they got
too many trophies

12:03.989 --> 12:06.058
and awards and medals
for nothing.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.393
- Yeah, for sitting on the pot.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.527
- Exactly.

12:08.527 --> 12:10.196
For being a big bunch of babies.

12:10.196 --> 12:11.664
(laughs)

12:11.664 --> 12:15.367
- So you can see why we think
you're a natural for this.

12:17.036 --> 12:20.139
10:00 a.m. tomorrow,
be in our meeting

12:20.139 --> 12:21.640
to meet the Midway client.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.010
We want you to be the one to
tell the constipated adult

12:26.212 --> 12:28.180
it's time to become
a confident adult.

12:32.718 --> 12:35.554
(phone chimes)

12:35.554 --> 12:37.757
- No, I said I'd
be home after work.

12:38.724 --> 12:41.360
(phone chimes)

12:46.799 --> 12:48.434
Hey baby, I was
just about to call.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.368
- So why didn't you?

12:49.368 --> 12:50.636
- Mom?

12:50.636 --> 12:51.604
- I left a message
at your office.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.571
What could be more important

12:52.571 --> 12:54.740
than your mother's life at risk?

12:54.740 --> 12:57.009
- Wait, Mom, hold on.

12:57.843 --> 12:58.878
I'll call you right back.

13:00.446 --> 13:01.914
- Marty, where the hell are you?

13:01.914 --> 13:03.182
Move it!

13:03.182 --> 13:04.450
We have to be at the
restaurant at seven.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.385
I need a glass of wine now.

13:06.385 --> 13:07.953
So pick up a bottle
and not a cheap one.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.556
See you on time,
assuming you love me.

13:10.556 --> 13:11.724
You understand?

13:11.724 --> 13:12.625
Bye.

13:14.426 --> 13:15.928
- [Marty] Mom, are you okay?

13:15.928 --> 13:16.962
- I'm fine.

13:16.962 --> 13:17.797
Don't worry.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.631
- Don't worry?

13:18.631 --> 13:19.665
What the hell?

13:19.665 --> 13:20.900
What happened?

13:20.900 --> 13:23.302
- It was a typical young
man blowing off steam.

13:23.302 --> 13:26.338
I said a few things I probably
shouldn't have, you know.

13:26.338 --> 13:28.240
One woman had to
hold him back...

13:28.240 --> 13:30.342
- Held him back, holy shit, Mom.

13:30.342 --> 13:33.245
What did I tell you
about mouthing off
to the wrong people?

13:33.245 --> 13:34.914
- I know.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.849
Lately I just feel so unsettled.

13:36.849 --> 13:38.384
- God, Mom.

13:38.384 --> 13:40.753
Just don't act out.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.389
- Well, I'm really
worried because I...

13:43.389 --> 13:44.924
I did another stupid
thing at work.

13:44.924 --> 13:49.995
I let a woman make false
claims on her paperwork.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.232
I screw up everything.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.235
All I make is mistakes.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.069
- Come on, Mom.

13:57.069 --> 13:58.304
You made me.

13:58.304 --> 14:00.005
- And I never see you.

14:00.005 --> 14:03.475
You live in sunny California
and you never come here.

14:03.475 --> 14:06.445
- Well, I'm planning on
coming to New York soon.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.514
- You promise?

14:08.514 --> 14:09.715
- I don't know.

14:09.715 --> 14:12.218
You know, when I do,
we're gonna have some...

14:12.218 --> 14:13.452
We're gonna have a great time

14:13.452 --> 14:16.755
and check out some of
those edgy galleries

14:16.755 --> 14:18.624
off the beaten path
you like, you know?

14:18.624 --> 14:19.859
And then you'll forget all about

14:19.859 --> 14:22.494
these risky little
mistakes, okay?

14:22.494 --> 14:23.395
- Okay.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.131
- $55.95.

14:26.131 --> 14:27.132
- Fuck.

14:27.132 --> 14:27.967
- What, what, what, what?

14:27.967 --> 14:28.801
Are you okay?

14:28.801 --> 14:30.035
- Yeah.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.537
Everything's great.

14:33.305 --> 14:34.540
How long do you think
this is gonna take?

14:34.540 --> 14:36.108
Because some big stuff
came up at work tonight

14:36.108 --> 14:37.810
and I just gotta get--

14:37.810 --> 14:39.378
- Stop, stop, Marty.

14:39.378 --> 14:40.613
This is important, okay?

14:40.613 --> 14:42.915
I need you to be nice,
especially to Ray,

14:42.915 --> 14:44.250
because all of his blogs are

14:44.250 --> 14:46.385
about the major
retailer buyers, okay?

14:47.519 --> 14:49.855
And he might do a write
up on my line, remember?

14:49.855 --> 14:50.890
Good, okay, so...

14:52.258 --> 14:53.993
(laughs) He thinks your
commercials are funny too,

14:53.993 --> 14:56.295
so they're gonna be
encouraging, right?

14:56.295 --> 14:57.129
Right?

14:57.129 --> 14:58.063
- Absolutely.

14:58.063 --> 14:58.898
- Promise?
- Yes.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.232
- How perfect, honey.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.734
(laughs)

15:01.734 --> 15:04.737
- Well, you know, I heard
you know who is wearing Gucci

15:04.737 --> 15:05.571
to the Oscars.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.405
- Oh gosh.

15:06.405 --> 15:08.173
- How perfect.

15:08.173 --> 15:10.342
(laughs)

15:10.342 --> 15:12.211
- I'd never wear Gucci.

15:12.211 --> 15:17.283
I mean, who wears Gucci anyway?

15:18.651 --> 15:21.053
- How can I convince you
to come down to my studio

15:21.053 --> 15:23.722
and see my lingerie line?

15:23.722 --> 15:28.727
- Oh, I'd really love to,
Miss Lydia, just love it.

15:28.727 --> 15:32.665
(kisses) But I'm
just so overbooked.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.133
Don't you have a
website I can glance?

15:34.133 --> 15:36.068
- Well, the website,
it's coming.

15:36.068 --> 15:37.436
- You ain't got no website?

15:37.436 --> 15:38.737
- No, but it's coming.

15:38.737 --> 15:39.972
- On the way.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.240
- Yeah, we're just
still in production.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.242
We're trying to get
that off the ground.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.476
- It's off, it's off.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.011
- (laughs) Yeah.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.713
But you know what, Ray, I
know if you blog about me.

15:47.713 --> 15:51.216
Listen to me, if you blog
about me, I will get orders.

15:51.216 --> 15:52.885
- Raise the play,
raise the play.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.119
- Raise the play.

15:54.119 --> 15:56.021
He always says that,
I think it's so funny.

15:56.021 --> 15:56.922
- Raise the play.

15:56.922 --> 15:58.190
Raise the play.

15:59.224 --> 16:00.192
- Oh, perfect,
honey, I like that.

16:00.192 --> 16:02.127
Would I blog to that one.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.163
- Alright, so let's
celebrate that.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.798
Okay, no, champagne.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.732
Let's do champagne.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.701
- Oh, that would be perfect.

16:08.701 --> 16:13.238
You should manufacture
your lingerie in Cambodia.

16:13.238 --> 16:14.073
- Really?

16:14.073 --> 16:15.474
- Everyone's there.

16:15.474 --> 16:20.212
It's so inexpensive, fascinating
culture, it's perfect.

16:20.212 --> 16:22.081
- Cambodia is slave labor.

16:22.081 --> 16:23.749
Is that what makes it
fascinating culture,

16:23.749 --> 16:26.218
kids working in a factory
all day for two bucks?

16:29.188 --> 16:30.189
- How perfect.

16:42.101 --> 16:43.502
- I don't feel
loved by you, Marty.

16:43.502 --> 16:46.171
You don't respect my friends,
you eye on the women,

16:46.171 --> 16:49.308
you don't take me on vacations,
and you lie all the time!

16:49.308 --> 16:51.176
And you never let me watch
my favorite TV shows.

16:51.176 --> 16:54.613
Marty only cares about Marty!

16:54.613 --> 16:55.848
- Are you kidding?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.217
That's not true!

16:58.217 --> 17:00.319
I mean, who funded
the startup cost

17:00.319 --> 17:01.820
for your lingerie company?

17:01.820 --> 17:05.124
I spent $12,000 showing you
how much I believe in you.

17:05.124 --> 17:07.693
- Oh my god, Marty,
that was just a loan!

17:09.728 --> 17:11.864
- So this is how
you pay me back?

17:11.864 --> 17:13.332
By just walking out on me?

17:13.332 --> 17:15.267
I mean, you turn a
thank you into fuck you

17:15.267 --> 17:17.770
with 50% interest!

17:17.770 --> 17:19.905
- That's the problem, Marty.

17:19.905 --> 17:21.473
You loaned me money,
you didn't give it to me

17:21.473 --> 17:23.575
because you didn't
believe in me.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.011
I believed in you!

17:26.011 --> 17:27.880
I thought you were different.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.516
But all you love is
being loved or needed,

17:30.516 --> 17:32.551
whatever you think love is.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.852
Just move.

17:33.852 --> 17:36.021
(smacks)

17:38.390 --> 17:41.026
(doorbell rings)

17:41.026 --> 17:41.927
- Back already?

17:45.164 --> 17:47.766
I'll kiss but I don't
know about making up.

17:48.667 --> 17:49.935
- Well, if you want a kiss,

17:49.935 --> 17:51.203
you're gonna have to
invite me in first.

17:51.203 --> 17:52.104
- Rawl?

17:52.938 --> 17:54.173
Rawl!

17:54.173 --> 17:55.307
- I've returned
in body and soul.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.010
- Oh my god, man.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.612
I haven't seen your
ass in like nine years.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.214
- And no matter how
nicely you ask me,

18:02.214 --> 18:04.116
I'm not gonna let you see it.

18:04.116 --> 18:05.651
- Check this out, man.

18:05.651 --> 18:10.322
I saved all your postcards
from Peking to Pittsburgh.

18:10.989 --> 18:12.357
Come on, come on, man.

18:12.357 --> 18:14.460
- Walked around the world.

18:14.460 --> 18:17.729
Sung where Caesar spoke, danced
where Attila the Hun hid.

18:18.864 --> 18:20.265
Dined where Jesus last ate.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.135
Now it is time for me to rest.

18:24.503 --> 18:27.072
- Well, your ass is resting
on a goose down designer sofa,

18:27.072 --> 18:30.075
so rest up, I gotta
get some work done.

18:30.075 --> 18:32.578
(calm music)

18:35.814 --> 18:38.650
(deep breathing)

18:50.696 --> 18:51.597
Amazing.

18:52.798 --> 18:57.870
You got no home,
no cash, nothing.

19:00.706 --> 19:01.907
And you're so together.

19:03.575 --> 19:05.544
- Peace is knowing
you're just a part.

19:11.817 --> 19:12.851
- Just a part, huh?

19:15.187 --> 19:17.422
- Marty, my nomadic life
of nine years has led me

19:17.422 --> 19:20.092
on a journey, a future path.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.328
Along the way, I've
met many craftmakers

19:23.328 --> 19:24.496
whose gifts are golden

19:25.831 --> 19:27.966
yet they sell for pennies and
their family ends up broke

19:27.966 --> 19:29.768
and continues to suffer.

19:29.768 --> 19:32.204
What I want to do is sell
their gifts to the West

19:32.204 --> 19:33.572
through an importation business.

19:33.572 --> 19:35.007
I've looked into it

19:35.007 --> 19:37.342
and it's gonna cost 10,000
American dollars to get started.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.545
I don't have any family
I can borrow from

19:39.545 --> 19:41.046
or friends I can draw from.

19:43.248 --> 19:46.118
Marty, would you
lend me that money?

19:47.452 --> 19:49.588
(laughs)

19:51.290 --> 19:52.257
- Are you serious?

19:55.294 --> 19:57.729
- Rawl, man, this
is our MSW, not ATM.

20:00.365 --> 20:01.600
- Is that a yes?

20:04.469 --> 20:05.370
- Up his ass.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.348
- So where is this
creative director

20:16.348 --> 20:18.250
with his finger on the pulse?

20:19.117 --> 20:20.018
- Oh, with you.

20:21.119 --> 20:22.888
Bill, I would like very
much to introduce you

20:22.888 --> 20:25.357
to Martin Weiss, the
man who's gonna create

20:25.357 --> 20:28.026
your new campaign for
the investor too young

20:28.026 --> 20:30.829
and too insecure to
understand why it is

20:30.829 --> 20:32.998
he ought to be investing.

20:32.998 --> 20:34.266
- How you doing, sir,
nice to meet you.

20:34.266 --> 20:35.167
- Oh.

20:36.668 --> 20:41.139
- I'm thinking the way to
sell investment programs

20:41.139 --> 20:43.675
in this environment
might be with someone

20:43.675 --> 20:46.445
who has nothing to lose.

20:46.445 --> 20:48.447
Imagine a spokesman.

20:48.447 --> 20:51.216
An earthy, long
haired, zenned out dude

20:51.216 --> 20:52.818
who's been to the edge
of the world and back.

20:52.818 --> 20:56.288
He has no money or
desire to have anything.

20:56.288 --> 20:59.324
But he has that one thing
that everyone wants.

20:59.324 --> 21:01.627
It's the secret of his
supreme confidence,

21:01.627 --> 21:03.762
it's the thing that all
your potential clients

21:03.762 --> 21:05.664
loaded with responsibilities
and mortgages

21:05.664 --> 21:07.899
and families and fears all want.

21:10.002 --> 21:10.969
- And what's that?

21:13.839 --> 21:14.740
- Inner peace.

21:16.575 --> 21:19.011
- [Summer] There's an
urgent call for Marty?

21:19.011 --> 21:20.178
- Summer, we're in the
middle of a meeting.

21:22.581 --> 21:24.416
- [Summer] I'm sorry,
sir, I wouldn't interrupt

21:24.416 --> 21:27.085
but there appears
to be an emergency.

21:27.085 --> 21:28.153
- Then what is it?

21:31.890 --> 21:33.091
- [Summer] It's his mother, sir.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.102
(crying)

21:49.408 --> 21:53.211
- I waited in the freezing
cold for two hours

21:53.211 --> 21:55.514
for the locksmith to come.

21:55.514 --> 21:59.051
And without my purse, I
didn't have any cash or cards.

21:59.051 --> 22:02.187
I had to give him my
mother's ring for collateral.

22:02.187 --> 22:03.422
- You gave him Nana's ring?

22:03.422 --> 22:06.458
That's a $3,000 ring
for a $300 collateral.

22:06.458 --> 22:07.859
- Don't make me feel worse.

22:09.294 --> 22:12.798
I had to stand in the street
like a homeless person

22:12.798 --> 22:15.600
begging for change just
to call the locksmith!

22:15.600 --> 22:17.469
- Mom, please, just don't cry.

22:17.469 --> 22:20.105
I know you left your
purse on the train,

22:20.105 --> 22:22.641
but why didn't you
just call me collect?

22:22.641 --> 22:25.477
- Because you are
3,000 miles away.

22:25.477 --> 22:26.645
You can't help me.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.046
- I could have
wired you the money.

22:28.046 --> 22:29.448
- I don't need your money!

22:30.782 --> 22:34.119
Every god-awful night I
come home to an empty house.

22:34.119 --> 22:37.923
Every fucking morning
I wake up alone.

22:37.923 --> 22:40.792
I make one stupid
decision after another

22:40.792 --> 22:44.696
because I have no
one to talk to!

22:44.696 --> 22:46.198
- You have friends--

22:46.198 --> 22:49.935
- My friends are preoccupied
with their own useless lives.

22:49.935 --> 22:50.936
- Mom, listen.

22:50.936 --> 22:52.804
You're just upset, okay?

22:52.804 --> 22:55.040
You're probably
cold, you're hungry.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.342
Just, why don't you
take a nice hot bath.

22:57.342 --> 22:58.310
You know, everything will be--

22:58.310 --> 22:59.578
- I don't want to take a bath!

22:59.578 --> 23:01.513
If you want to get off
the phone, just tell me.

23:01.513 --> 23:03.281
Just stop lying to me
like everyone else!

23:03.281 --> 23:04.116
- Mom!

23:04.116 --> 23:06.251
Mom.

23:07.252 --> 23:08.687
Just take a deep breath, okay?

23:08.687 --> 23:10.255
Just take a deep
breath and calm down.

23:10.255 --> 23:13.325
Let me hear you say
there's no emergency,

23:13.325 --> 23:17.396
everything's okay, I'm
calm and in control.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.231
Cause you are, right?

23:19.231 --> 23:21.566
You said it before, let
me hear you say it again.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.069
Breathe and say it.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.437
- I'm...

23:25.437 --> 23:28.940
I'm calm and in control.

23:29.975 --> 23:30.909
- Right.

23:30.909 --> 23:31.743
Ready?

23:31.743 --> 23:32.611
We're gonna breathe.

23:32.611 --> 23:35.013
One, two, three, hold.

23:37.949 --> 23:42.654
One, two, three, release.

23:49.361 --> 23:51.963
You're the only good
thing in my life.

23:51.963 --> 23:53.632
- Come on, Mom.

23:53.632 --> 23:56.168
That's not true.

23:56.168 --> 23:57.436
- It is.

23:57.436 --> 24:02.007
I'm okay, I'm just
here, by myself.

24:02.007 --> 24:07.012
Have a good day.

24:17.022 --> 24:18.256
- I'd like to be
working for the guy

24:18.256 --> 24:19.891
who scores on the
Midway account,

24:21.126 --> 24:24.396
not with cartoon cat ladies.

24:24.396 --> 24:25.764
- Patty the pussy pickler.

24:26.698 --> 24:27.899
- Mmhm.

24:27.899 --> 24:28.800
- Oh, fuck it.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.403
Just clearing my head.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.806
- Why, so your mom can fill
it with shit again tomorrow?

24:36.975 --> 24:39.377
- That is an interesting
theory, Summer.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.448
Confidence, right?

24:43.448 --> 24:44.716
Confidence.

24:44.716 --> 24:46.651
I can write about
confidence, right?

24:46.651 --> 24:48.119
I'm Mr. Confident.

24:49.421 --> 24:51.056
How am I gonna write
about confidence

24:51.056 --> 24:52.791
when I can't even
get out of bed?

24:53.592 --> 24:54.493
- That's too bad.

24:55.560 --> 24:57.128
I bet if your mom's
life didn't suck so bad,

24:57.128 --> 24:58.797
yours wouldn't either.

25:08.106 --> 25:11.109
(percussion music)

25:39.404 --> 25:41.907
(calm music)

25:50.415 --> 25:52.984
- Want a three month job
to earn that cash you need?

25:54.019 --> 25:56.054
- Marty, I know nothing
about advertising.

25:56.955 --> 25:58.089
- No, no.

25:58.089 --> 26:00.792
It's more like
looking after someone.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.395
Like babysitting.

26:04.863 --> 26:06.631
- You have a hidden
bastard child?

26:08.099 --> 26:09.301
- No.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.902
My parents divorced
when I was five.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.672
Dad bailed on alimony so
Mom went back to school,

26:13.672 --> 26:16.274
got a career, became
a social worker

26:16.274 --> 26:18.176
like her sister, my Aunt Judy.

26:20.278 --> 26:22.213
My Aunt Judy's responsible
for getting my mom

26:22.213 --> 26:23.648
back on her feet.

26:23.648 --> 26:25.517
And hundreds of women.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.384
- Hundreds.

26:26.384 --> 26:27.218
- Yeah.

26:27.218 --> 26:28.453
- Wow, that's amazing.

26:28.453 --> 26:29.654
You know, I knew this
woman in Guatemala who--

26:29.654 --> 26:33.158
- Well, I mean, you
know, it's not amazing.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.027
I mean, sure, I've
given her money,

26:36.027 --> 26:38.830
but that doesn't
fix the big problem.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.765
Working on countless
social cases

26:40.765 --> 26:42.334
where these men
abandon their families

26:42.334 --> 26:44.069
has really affected her.

26:44.069 --> 26:46.871
Aunt Judy hasn't had a
decent boyfriend since.

26:46.871 --> 26:49.541
She's convinced that
all men are pigs.

26:49.541 --> 26:50.575
- How could I help?

26:51.543 --> 26:52.644
- Teach her.

26:52.644 --> 26:54.713
Teach her that men can be good.

26:54.713 --> 26:56.114
Be the man of her dreams.

26:58.416 --> 26:59.784
What?

26:59.784 --> 27:01.119
It's only for a few months.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.355
Alright, a month.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.790
- I'm sorry, Marty, I
can't feign romance.

27:05.790 --> 27:06.825
- Wait, wait, wait.

27:09.060 --> 27:12.564
I'm not asking you to go and
sleep with her for money.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.301
Let me show you this.

27:16.301 --> 27:21.373
You go to New York and
you show this woman

27:22.173 --> 27:23.608
how good a true man can be.

27:23.608 --> 27:25.877
I mean, she's a champion
of the downtrodden.

27:25.877 --> 27:27.879
She makes sure that working
moms on government assistance

27:27.879 --> 27:29.914
get all the assistance
they truly need.

27:29.914 --> 27:31.650
You know, but now
she needs assistance

27:31.650 --> 27:35.186
and I can't help her,
I'm too tied down.

27:35.186 --> 27:36.621
I'm worried.

27:36.621 --> 27:38.623
You'd be like a
personal trainer.

27:38.623 --> 27:40.425
You know, instead of
making a fat person thin,

27:40.425 --> 27:44.195
you'd be making a scared
person brave, you know?

27:44.195 --> 27:45.930
You show Aunt Judy life,

27:45.930 --> 27:47.098
you give her what you've got.

27:47.098 --> 27:49.401
Culture, stories, attention.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.269
You know, you fix her wounds.

27:51.269 --> 27:52.904
- Like a healer.

27:52.904 --> 27:53.805
- Exactly.

27:55.140 --> 27:57.776
You're a healer, restoring
her emotional health.

28:00.445 --> 28:02.714
- Marty, I don't
understand how I'd do this.

28:06.284 --> 28:10.321
- Rawl, do you
understand $10,000?

28:17.562 --> 28:20.799
Dress a little sharper and
I'll get you a haircut.

28:20.799 --> 28:23.134
I'll take you to my barber
and you can crash at Rupert's.

28:23.134 --> 28:25.904
Remember him, the guy who
ran poetry slams in Venice?

28:25.904 --> 28:28.239
Well, he now lives in
Brooklyn and he owes me.

28:28.239 --> 28:30.275
I'll even throw in 500
a week for expenses.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.544
Just give Aunt Judy
all your attention,

28:32.544 --> 28:34.012
share your learnings.

28:34.012 --> 28:35.980
But remember, under no
circumstances let her know

28:35.980 --> 28:36.815
that we're friends.

28:36.815 --> 28:38.016
It would trip her up.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.751
Promise, man, keep
this a secret.

28:40.518 --> 28:42.287
This is serious, Rawl.

28:42.287 --> 28:43.354
You're on a mission.

28:44.389 --> 28:45.557
- A healing mission.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.328
- Shit.

28:50.328 --> 28:51.696
Hey, how about a coffee?

28:51.696 --> 28:52.864
- Oh, not for me.

28:52.864 --> 28:55.033
I haven't had caffeine
in eight years.

28:55.033 --> 28:56.534
Sends me loopy.

28:56.534 --> 28:58.603
- Oh, well, I can't say
I'm technically drug free

28:58.603 --> 29:00.371
because I basically survive
off coffee and cigarettes,

29:00.371 --> 29:03.875
but I haven't done coke, dope,
or green smoke in five years.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.176
Thank you.

29:05.176 --> 29:06.845
But problem is, I also
haven't been beyond

29:06.845 --> 29:10.014
like three blocks of this
shithole either, so...

29:10.014 --> 29:11.483
- You know, I've never
stayed in the same place

29:11.483 --> 29:13.518
for longer than three months
in the last seven years.

29:13.518 --> 29:14.686
- Holy shit, I got it!

29:15.587 --> 29:16.454
You're homophobic.

29:16.454 --> 29:17.388
- Oh, no, no, no.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.523
I embrace all my brothers.

29:18.523 --> 29:20.391
- See, I'm diagnosed
agoraphobic.

29:20.391 --> 29:22.427
Agora's the Greek
word, it means outside.

29:22.427 --> 29:25.263
I am afraid of leaving my home.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.400
That makes you home-ophobic,
afraid of having a home.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.869
See, it's a little (laughs).

29:30.869 --> 29:32.170
- I think comfort's an illusion.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.605
- Bullshit, it's contagious.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.173
- Are you a shut in or a shrink?

29:35.173 --> 29:36.541
- Both.

29:36.541 --> 29:38.243
I have a degree in psychology
from Brute College.

29:38.243 --> 29:39.577
Classes were just full of nuts

29:39.577 --> 29:41.312
trying to manage
their own psychoses.

29:41.312 --> 29:42.881
Why do you think I'm so
afraid to go outside?

29:42.881 --> 29:46.151
Because the world is one big
affliction if you go outside.

29:46.151 --> 29:48.620
You are sure to suffer.

29:48.620 --> 29:52.090
Look at all these fucking books!

29:52.090 --> 29:53.825
I know too much, you know?

29:53.825 --> 29:54.726
- Know too much?

29:55.493 --> 29:56.761
About what?

29:56.761 --> 29:58.663
- Oh, like disaster
and disappointment.

29:58.663 --> 30:00.965
They wait for you around
every little turn.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.200
And love, love.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.402
Oh god, it just
fucking kills you.

30:04.402 --> 30:07.906
So we just repeat and we
repeat until we just give up

30:07.906 --> 30:10.241
or we end up frantically
demanding satisfaction

30:10.241 --> 30:12.076
from someone who's not
even capable of taking care

30:12.076 --> 30:13.611
of themselves.

30:13.611 --> 30:15.313
Or, or, or we spend most of
our lives trying to make up

30:15.313 --> 30:17.015
for what our parents
never gave us

30:17.015 --> 30:19.851
and so the words then are
meaningless next to the message.

30:19.851 --> 30:21.252
- The message?

30:21.252 --> 30:22.253
- Yes, the message, the message,
the big fucking message!

30:22.253 --> 30:23.755
- What's the message?

30:23.755 --> 30:25.023
- There is no message.

30:26.057 --> 30:27.492
Ah.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.427
Or is there?

30:32.230 --> 30:33.131
- Yeah.

30:37.068 --> 30:38.636
- I got presents.

30:38.636 --> 30:42.006
I got presents, I got presents,

30:42.006 --> 30:45.343
I got aloha, aloha.

30:45.343 --> 30:46.711
- A vacation?

30:46.711 --> 30:48.213
- A vacation, baby.

30:48.213 --> 30:49.848
- Marty!

30:49.848 --> 30:52.283
Thank you, oh my god.

30:52.283 --> 30:54.018
I forgive you, I forgive you.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.988
Let me see, when are we going?

30:56.988 --> 30:57.889
- Next month.

30:58.990 --> 31:02.260
I'm going to screw
you in Honolulu, baby.

31:04.529 --> 31:05.563
Come on.

31:05.563 --> 31:07.031
I meant make love.

31:07.031 --> 31:09.300
- I like to screw, I
don't like being screwed.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.836
And I know that's what will
happen if I forgive you.

31:11.836 --> 31:12.871
- I...

31:12.871 --> 31:15.173
- Marty, do you believe in me?

31:16.207 --> 31:17.542
- Yes.

31:17.542 --> 31:20.245
- Then help me with my career.

31:20.245 --> 31:22.380
- I told you, I'll
do everything I can--

31:22.380 --> 31:23.314
- Okay, Marty.

31:23.314 --> 31:24.749
- Once your line is finished.

31:24.749 --> 31:27.385
I'll create a promotional
campaign, a website, everything.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.620
- Marty, my line is finished!

31:28.620 --> 31:29.587
It's just excuses.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.790
Why did I think
you were different?

31:32.790 --> 31:34.826
You said I could be somebody.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.561
- Yes, you can!

31:36.561 --> 31:38.596
- So call your fancy
friends, Marty.

31:39.964 --> 31:43.268
Get them to profile me and my
lingerie in a damn magazine.

31:43.268 --> 31:44.569
Okay?

31:44.569 --> 31:45.904
Get my name out there.

31:48.006 --> 31:49.374
Show me you believe in me!

31:59.250 --> 32:01.252
(sighs)

32:04.522 --> 32:05.490
- Rupert?

32:05.490 --> 32:07.091
- Yeah.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.493
- What's in those bottles?

32:08.493 --> 32:10.194
- Oh, just a little
health drink.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.997
- Some kind of juice?

32:12.997 --> 32:14.365
- (laughs) You could say that.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.234
- What kind?

32:16.234 --> 32:17.635
- Mine.

32:17.635 --> 32:18.469
- It's not.

32:18.469 --> 32:19.537
- Oh, it is.

32:19.537 --> 32:21.439
100% pee from me.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.174
Healthiest drink on
the planet, my friend.

32:23.174 --> 32:24.676
Forget the apple a day lie.

32:24.676 --> 32:26.577
All you really need each day
is a glass of your own urine.

32:26.577 --> 32:29.547
Now the AMA, they
hide the truth, okay,

32:29.547 --> 32:32.817
to keep us all sick and
popping their pills.

32:32.817 --> 32:33.651
- Fascinating.

32:33.651 --> 32:34.585
- Yeah.

32:34.585 --> 32:35.687
Have a drink from me, bud.

32:35.687 --> 32:37.021
There's plenty.

32:37.021 --> 32:37.922
Want one?

32:40.258 --> 32:42.527
Knock that back, I'm
gonna go take a dump.

32:42.527 --> 32:43.728
- I'm good for now.

32:43.728 --> 32:44.696
- Sure.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.164
Maybe later.

32:46.164 --> 32:47.265
Anytime you want it.

32:51.336 --> 32:54.138
(dramatic music)

33:20.398 --> 33:23.401
- Hey, a pack of Rex, please.

33:30.008 --> 33:30.908
Thanks.

33:32.944 --> 33:33.911
- Can I get a lighter, please?

33:33.911 --> 33:34.746
- What kind do you want?

33:34.746 --> 33:35.646
- Any lighter's fine.

33:37.615 --> 33:40.084
(laughs)

33:40.084 --> 33:40.918
- Whoa!

33:40.918 --> 33:41.919
Lady, you alright?

33:41.919 --> 33:43.221
- No, this freak
is following me.

33:43.221 --> 33:44.455
- Hey, buddy, you--

33:44.455 --> 33:45.323
- Hey, I just want
to give her a light.

33:46.758 --> 33:47.592
(gasps)

33:47.592 --> 33:48.426
- Here's a light.

33:48.426 --> 33:49.327
Lights out!

33:55.733 --> 33:58.469
(phone ringing)

34:00.605 --> 34:01.706
- You got Marty.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.940
- Yeah, well, you got trouble.

34:02.940 --> 34:04.475
Some man attacked Rawl
while he was trying

34:04.475 --> 34:06.210
to give your aunt a light.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.279
- Aunt Judy doesn't smoke.

34:08.279 --> 34:09.614
- Judy don't smoke?

34:09.614 --> 34:10.514
- What?

34:11.382 --> 34:13.117
She doesn't smoke?

34:13.117 --> 34:15.353
- No, always told me,
bad for your health.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.687
- Bad?

34:16.687 --> 34:18.322
It almost gave me a concussion.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.225
- I'm sorry, it wasn't her.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.460
You know what, I
meant to tell you this,

34:22.460 --> 34:24.728
but you can ambush her
at the Coffee Clash

34:24.728 --> 34:25.929
around where she lives.

34:25.929 --> 34:27.998
She's there almost every
morning at 9:00 a.m.

34:27.998 --> 34:29.434
- Is that cold, is that
helping the swelling?

34:29.434 --> 34:30.333
- Yeah.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.880
- Relax, take a breath, Judy.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.014
I got your bagel waiting.

34:44.014 --> 34:44.815
Gluten free, right?

34:44.815 --> 34:45.650
That's what you want.

34:45.650 --> 34:46.650
- Yeah, great.

34:46.650 --> 34:47.819
- Everything alright?

34:47.819 --> 34:49.487
- No, I gotta go across
town to the office

34:49.487 --> 34:51.489
of management and budget
to formally request

34:51.489 --> 34:52.824
an increase in textbook funding

34:52.824 --> 34:54.292
for children in public housing.

34:54.292 --> 34:56.726
Sons of bitches won't
cough up another red cent

34:56.726 --> 34:58.930
unless it's for a
fucking animal shelter.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.398
- Hey, politicians.

35:00.398 --> 35:02.133
They care more about cats and
dogs than the gutter kids.

35:02.133 --> 35:03.801
You know, the man knows
exactly where the votes

35:03.801 --> 35:04.635
are coming from.

35:04.635 --> 35:05.470
Don't let 'em shit ya.

35:05.470 --> 35:06.437
- Screw the mayor.

35:06.437 --> 35:07.405
- Absolutely.

35:07.405 --> 35:08.573
He's a supreme sell out.

35:08.573 --> 35:10.241
- Yeah, bear in a bullshit.

35:10.241 --> 35:11.642
- Crapload of corruption.

35:11.642 --> 35:12.477
- Asshole.

35:12.477 --> 35:13.711
Assassin of democracy.

35:13.711 --> 35:16.914
- Asshole assassin of
democracy, alright.

35:16.914 --> 35:18.716
Hey, voice of the
people right here.

35:18.716 --> 35:20.251
Coffee's on the house.

35:20.251 --> 35:21.185
- Oh, thank you, Larry.

35:21.185 --> 35:22.120
- Kick some ass, will you?

35:22.120 --> 35:22.820
- [Judith] How's your wife?

35:22.820 --> 35:23.654
- She's good.

35:23.654 --> 35:24.589
- [Judith] Okay, good.

35:24.589 --> 35:26.390
- Buddy, what do you need?

35:26.390 --> 35:27.325
Hey, hey.

35:27.325 --> 35:28.259
Hey, over here.

35:28.259 --> 35:29.494
- Do you recycle these?

35:29.494 --> 35:31.162
- These, let me see.

35:31.162 --> 35:33.531
Yeah, we fill 'em with
dirt and we plant daisies.

35:33.531 --> 35:34.465
- Fantastic.

35:34.465 --> 35:35.533
Hold on to that, thank you!

35:37.068 --> 35:39.704
(upbeat music)

35:53.451 --> 35:55.052
- Hey, what can I get you?

35:55.052 --> 35:57.188
- [Judith] Babs, when are
you gonna get gluten free?

35:57.188 --> 35:58.523
- I'm working on it.

35:58.523 --> 35:59.357
The usual?

35:59.357 --> 36:00.158
- Yes, please.

36:00.158 --> 36:00.958
- Alright.

36:00.958 --> 36:01.859
And for your friend?

36:04.529 --> 36:06.097
- He's not...

36:06.097 --> 36:07.598
- Oh, too bad.

36:07.598 --> 36:08.966
Kid's got nice cheekbones.

36:10.668 --> 36:11.569
- Oh, uh...

36:12.837 --> 36:13.838
I will get...

36:15.606 --> 36:16.507
Same as her.

36:17.909 --> 36:18.743
- Sounds delicious.

36:18.743 --> 36:19.644
- Thank you.

36:27.285 --> 36:29.086
Reading anything
interesting there?

36:31.022 --> 36:33.357
- Yeah, death, disease, poverty.

36:34.659 --> 36:37.228
The New York City quarterly
social service report.

36:38.863 --> 36:40.731
- Reminds me of Phnom Penh.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.669
- Well, it's right here in the
wealthiest city in the world.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.505
- You know, the US has the
highest teen pregnancy rate

36:47.505 --> 36:49.440
in the industrialized world?

36:49.440 --> 36:51.209
- And the highest TV rate.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.411
And childhood abandonment.

36:53.411 --> 36:54.912
And lowest reading skills.

36:54.912 --> 36:59.283
And it goes on and on and on.

36:59.283 --> 37:01.052
- Well, there are
more toxic places.

37:01.052 --> 37:01.886
- Oh yeah?

37:01.886 --> 37:02.720
Name 'em.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.554
- Nairobi.

37:03.554 --> 37:04.388
Kabul.

37:04.388 --> 37:05.957
Calcutta.

37:05.957 --> 37:06.791
Chernobyl.

37:06.791 --> 37:07.625
Beijing.

37:07.625 --> 37:08.893
- Newark, New Jersey.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.361
- Newark, New Jersey?

37:10.361 --> 37:11.963
- Place is so toxic the
only thing that grows there

37:11.963 --> 37:13.064
is the crime rate.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.199
(laughs)

37:20.571 --> 37:22.406
Let me ask you something.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.775
Have you ever been to
any of those places?

37:24.775 --> 37:26.310
- All of them.

37:26.310 --> 37:27.211
Even Chernobyl.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.214
- Really, isn't it radioactive?

37:30.214 --> 37:31.249
I thought that was off limits.

37:31.249 --> 37:34.752
The only thing off limits in
Russia is other man's vodka.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.921
(laughs)

37:38.489 --> 37:40.191
- What did you do there?

37:40.191 --> 37:43.961
- I started washing
dishes and making omelets.

37:43.961 --> 37:45.463
Soon enough, I was
teaching cooks there

37:45.463 --> 37:47.832
how to cook things other
than boiled cabbage.

37:47.832 --> 37:49.133
- So I take it you're a cook.

37:49.133 --> 37:51.702
- I like to spread
out my resources.

37:52.803 --> 37:54.171
- What were you
doing in Calcutta?

37:54.171 --> 37:56.107
- In Calcutta, I was working

37:56.107 --> 37:57.775
for a German relief organization

37:57.775 --> 38:00.177
distributing water
purification tablets for women

38:00.177 --> 38:01.846
drawing water from unsafe wells.

38:03.214 --> 38:05.516
I realized I get the most
bountiful joy by giving.

38:05.516 --> 38:07.018
- Please.

38:07.018 --> 38:10.388
Been giving my whole life
and I'd really like it back.

38:11.822 --> 38:14.025
- That seems like a
very wounded sentiment.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.092
- Save your tears.

38:15.092 --> 38:16.560
Salt stings.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.728
- Can I ask what it is

38:17.728 --> 38:19.897
that you're so deeply
regretful about?

38:21.399 --> 38:22.933
- You have a couple hours?

38:22.933 --> 38:24.101
- Actually yeah, I do.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.838
- Well, I don't.

38:27.838 --> 38:29.640
And even if I did have a life,

38:29.640 --> 38:31.642
wouldn't have time
to enjoy it, so.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.144
Babs, I'm gonna need my check.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.079
- I feel your spirit.

38:35.079 --> 38:36.580
I'd love to share some
more time with you,

38:36.580 --> 38:38.249
maybe go for a drink.

38:39.050 --> 38:39.884
- A drink?

38:39.884 --> 38:41.319
- Yeah.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.521
- Kid, you sure you
haven't had a few already?

38:43.521 --> 38:45.856
I mean, I'm probably
twice your age.

38:45.856 --> 38:47.491
- With double the wisdom.

38:47.491 --> 38:49.260
I mean, I know that I
would definitely find it

38:49.260 --> 38:50.895
very stimulating.

38:50.895 --> 38:52.963
(laughs)

38:52.963 --> 38:54.632
- I haven't been stimulated
since I ran out of Duracells.

38:54.632 --> 38:55.533
- Excuse me?

38:56.901 --> 39:00.938
- I said it's been a long time
since I said what the hell.

39:00.938 --> 39:02.340
- So it's settled then.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.375
9:00 p.m. tonight
at the Algonquin.

39:04.375 --> 39:05.409
- The Algonquin?

39:06.944 --> 39:08.179
How can I say no to that?

39:08.179 --> 39:09.413
- Exactly.

39:09.413 --> 39:10.715
- What's your name?

39:11.549 --> 39:12.616
- Rawl.

39:12.616 --> 39:13.751
- Rawl?

39:13.751 --> 39:14.652
- Correct.

39:16.487 --> 39:18.656
(coughs)

39:26.831 --> 39:27.732
- Oh, god.

39:32.970 --> 39:35.039
(sighs)

39:37.708 --> 39:38.609
My god...

39:40.778 --> 39:41.812
Oh my god.

39:44.181 --> 39:45.082
Shit.

39:47.251 --> 39:48.185
Who am I kidding?

39:49.553 --> 39:50.988
The only man I'm seeing tonight

39:50.988 --> 39:52.957
is the one who's
delivering the pizza.

39:59.563 --> 40:03.300
- I think Papa
Smurf wants to play.

40:03.300 --> 40:07.037
- Yeah, well, Smurfette
is going to sleep.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.075
- How about one little kiss?

40:12.410 --> 40:15.279
- Just give me a kiss,
Marty, don't announce it.

40:17.748 --> 40:18.783
- Rawr!

40:18.783 --> 40:21.318
(laughs)

40:21.318 --> 40:23.587
(kisses)

40:23.587 --> 40:25.356
- I'm still going to sleep.

40:27.725 --> 40:28.592
- Baby.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.662
It's been a while.

40:31.662 --> 40:33.431
- You always get me
at the wrong time.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.733
Sunsets are my time,
that's when I feel sexy.

40:47.645 --> 40:50.214
- Wake up, the
sunset, it's killer.

40:51.048 --> 40:52.450
- Honey, I've just gotten up.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.551
- Look.

40:53.551 --> 40:56.187
(laughs)

40:56.187 --> 40:57.788
- Marty.

40:57.788 --> 40:59.423
Oh.

40:59.423 --> 41:00.291
That's beautiful.

41:01.425 --> 41:04.361
That's so sweet honey.
Come here.

41:04.361 --> 41:05.863
Get on top of me.

41:11.035 --> 41:11.936
Oh shit.

41:12.903 --> 41:15.306
Oh.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.440
Fuck.

41:16.440 --> 41:17.274
(phone ringing)

41:17.274 --> 41:18.509
Oh shit.

41:18.509 --> 41:19.510
- [Recording] You've
got Marty's home phone,

41:19.510 --> 41:21.111
tell me something good!

41:21.111 --> 41:22.580
- I'm fucking you, I'm--

41:22.580 --> 41:23.981
- [Judith] Marty,
Marty, it's me.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.850
Please pick up the
phone, it's an emergency,

41:25.850 --> 41:27.985
I really need to talk to you.

41:27.985 --> 41:28.886
Marty!

41:30.387 --> 41:31.622
- Wait, wait.

41:31.622 --> 41:32.690
- [Judith] Marty, I
know you're there.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.358
Please answer the phone.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.794
I know you're there and
I really, really need

41:36.794 --> 41:38.696
to talk to you,
it's very important.

41:38.696 --> 41:39.964
Please answer the phone!

41:41.265 --> 41:43.300
It's your mother, I really
need to talk to you.

41:43.300 --> 41:45.736
Please answer the phone,
it's very, very important.

41:45.736 --> 41:47.838
- Oh my god, Marty!

41:47.838 --> 41:49.340
- No!

41:49.340 --> 41:50.608
- [Judith] You are so
selfish, it's your mother.

41:50.608 --> 41:52.276
Damn it, I really
need to talk to you.

41:52.276 --> 41:54.378
Will you please
answer the phone.

41:54.378 --> 41:55.846
- No!

41:55.846 --> 41:59.583
- [Judith] Marty, I am really,
really in trouble here.

41:59.583 --> 42:01.385
I need you to pick
up the phone now!

42:03.187 --> 42:04.522
- Sorry.

42:04.522 --> 42:05.422
I'm sorry.

42:06.824 --> 42:09.193
(moans)

42:09.193 --> 42:10.728
- Marty?

42:10.728 --> 42:11.996
Marty?

42:11.996 --> 42:13.030
- Oh shit.

42:13.030 --> 42:13.931
- Marty?

42:15.799 --> 42:18.369
Oh my god, Marty, are
you being attacked?

42:18.369 --> 42:19.603
Should I call the police?

42:19.603 --> 42:21.338
- Oh, shit, I got it.

42:21.338 --> 42:22.239
- [Judith] Marty!

42:24.008 --> 42:24.975
- Hello?

42:24.975 --> 42:25.809
- Marty?

42:25.809 --> 42:28.546
- Yeah, just, the TV.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.080
TV was on too loud.

42:30.080 --> 42:32.650
- What, you couldn't turn off
the TV to talk to your mother?

42:32.650 --> 42:33.817
- PBS doc, you know.

42:34.885 --> 42:36.220
- What's wrong with you?

42:36.220 --> 42:38.522
- Couldn't finish
fucking your girlfriend?

42:38.522 --> 42:39.757
What is wrong with you?

42:40.658 --> 42:42.059
Get off of me.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.427
- What's the emergency?

42:44.695 --> 42:46.897
- I have been working
on this report all week

42:46.897 --> 42:50.935
and the printer that you told
me to buy, it's not printing.

42:50.935 --> 42:52.570
It's not working, I'm
pressing the button

42:52.570 --> 42:54.572
and it's not working and
I really need it to work.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.240
It's not printing.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.775
- The printer won't work?

42:57.775 --> 42:59.376
- I've gotta be at work
and I need to turn it in.

42:59.376 --> 43:02.313
- Oh god, 4:00 a.m.
in the morning.

43:02.313 --> 43:05.683
- Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.

43:05.683 --> 43:07.384
We can solve this.

43:09.219 --> 43:10.921
- I really need your help!

43:10.921 --> 43:15.626
- What color lights are
flashing on the printer?

43:15.626 --> 43:16.527
- What lights?

43:16.527 --> 43:17.728
There are no lights.

43:17.728 --> 43:19.496
There's no flashing
fucking lights.

43:19.496 --> 43:20.598
- On the power strip.

43:21.865 --> 43:25.603
The orange light, is it on?

43:25.603 --> 43:26.503
- Oh.

43:30.207 --> 43:31.609
- What's going on?

43:31.609 --> 43:32.509
- Oh.

43:34.078 --> 43:35.012
I see green lights!

43:35.012 --> 43:35.913
Okay.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.184
(screams) It's
printing, it's printing!

43:40.184 --> 43:41.318
Oh, thank you, honey.

43:41.318 --> 43:42.753
Thank you so much.

43:42.753 --> 43:45.656
Oh, it must be really
early in the morning there.

43:45.656 --> 43:47.057
I'm so sorry.

43:47.057 --> 43:49.126
- No, no, no, it's okay, really.

43:49.126 --> 43:50.394
- Thank you so much.

43:50.394 --> 43:52.196
I'm sorry, honey,
I'm really sorry.

43:52.196 --> 43:53.764
- No, it's fine.

43:55.666 --> 44:00.404
♪ When you're tired

44:00.404 --> 44:05.175

♪ From above ♪

44:07.978 --> 44:08.879

44:10.247 --> 44:12.416
Shouldn't you be working

44:12.416 --> 44:14.885
They want proposals by
the end of the week.

44:14.885 --> 44:17.688
Not to mention Gummy
Rats, Bigkidsworld.com.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.124
- How was the jingle?

44:22.426 --> 44:25.162
(phone ringing)

44:27.631 --> 44:28.899
- Hi.

44:28.899 --> 44:30.901
- Just calling to see
how that report went.

44:30.901 --> 44:32.369
- Huh, what?

44:32.369 --> 44:33.804
Oh, the report, yes, yes.

44:33.804 --> 44:35.873
It went fine, thank you.

44:35.873 --> 44:37.841
- You know, I'm just wondering

44:37.841 --> 44:41.178
if there was anything going on,

44:41.178 --> 44:43.881
anything freaking
you out, you know?

44:45.015 --> 44:46.450
- Well, yeah.

44:46.450 --> 44:49.219
I fell into a conversation
with this young man

44:49.219 --> 44:52.022
at a diner and he casually
asked me out for a drink.

44:53.357 --> 44:57.928
So probably being polite or
stroking his ego, I don't know,

44:58.729 --> 45:00.698
but I knew he would never show.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.700
I mean, who am I kidding?

45:02.700 --> 45:04.234
- Wait, wait, wait.

45:04.234 --> 45:07.504
So this joker didn't show
up for a drink at the bar?

45:08.338 --> 45:09.606
- No.

45:09.606 --> 45:11.775
Well, maybe he
did, but I didn't.

45:13.811 --> 45:14.978
- Oh, Mom.

45:16.480 --> 45:17.948
Why not?

45:17.948 --> 45:19.817
- I'm old and unattractive.

45:21.418 --> 45:23.587
Nobody's interested in that.

45:23.587 --> 45:26.790
And if, if I find someone
who is interested,

45:26.790 --> 45:28.258
I mean, guess what?

45:28.258 --> 45:30.194
They screw you because
they've just been screwed.

45:30.194 --> 45:32.396
- Come on, what do
you have to lose?

45:32.396 --> 45:33.764
- My sanity, for one.

45:33.764 --> 45:35.299
If another man pisses on me,

45:36.333 --> 45:38.602
I don't think I'll
survive the humiliation.

45:38.602 --> 45:40.370
- Mom, it's a date,
not an attack.

45:42.506 --> 45:44.108
- Yeah, well, maybe.

45:44.108 --> 45:45.576
I blew it.

45:45.576 --> 45:48.178
I mean, nothing ever
works out for me.

45:48.178 --> 45:50.047
- Well, hey, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

45:50.047 --> 45:51.515
What if it did?

45:51.515 --> 45:54.551
What if you go back to
the diner and he's there?

45:54.551 --> 45:56.120
Maybe it's a place
he frequents a lot

45:56.120 --> 45:57.588
and he works in the area.

45:57.588 --> 46:01.091
I mean, you go there,
you say it was a mistake,

46:01.091 --> 46:03.660
and ask if he'll
take a rain check.

46:03.660 --> 46:06.230
- Yeah, well, even if I
did, why would he want to?

46:06.230 --> 46:07.765
- Because you're
great, you know.

46:07.765 --> 46:12.669
You're intelligent and
vivacious and opinionated.

46:12.669 --> 46:14.772
Some guys like the insides too.

46:16.140 --> 46:18.642
(calm music)

46:41.298 --> 46:42.266
- Thank you, sir.

46:42.266 --> 46:44.768
Here, keep the change.
Thank you so much.

46:44.768 --> 46:46.970
- [Rawl] I've always wanted
to breathe in this space.

46:46.970 --> 46:50.240
The spirits here helped
shape our culture.

46:50.240 --> 46:51.441
- Yes, the Algonquin.

46:52.943 --> 46:54.178
This was the breeding ground

46:54.178 --> 46:56.079
for some of our
greatest literati.

46:56.079 --> 46:58.081
This is the room where
Dorothy Parker said

46:58.081 --> 46:59.650
"You can lead a whore
to culture,

46:59.650 --> 47:01.218
but you cannot make her think."

47:02.753 --> 47:03.921
- We're all whores.

47:04.755 --> 47:06.957
I was told that in Algiers.

47:06.957 --> 47:08.358
- Algiers.

47:08.358 --> 47:11.028
It's funny it took coming to
New York to really understand

47:11.028 --> 47:12.462
what that meant.

47:12.462 --> 47:15.098
- Well, guess New
York is a place

47:15.098 --> 47:17.968
where people do have to
sell their souls sometimes

47:17.968 --> 47:18.869
just to pay the rent.

47:18.869 --> 47:20.304
(pops)

47:20.304 --> 47:22.172
- I was requested
to bring our best.

47:23.674 --> 47:24.875
- Oh, champagne.

47:26.543 --> 47:27.611
Can you afford this?

47:29.012 --> 47:32.516
- Sometimes when I let myself
go, I really let myself go.

47:32.516 --> 47:33.750
Thank you.

47:33.750 --> 47:37.554
- Well, here's to
letting yourself go.

47:37.554 --> 47:39.323
(speaking in foreign language)

47:39.323 --> 47:41.091
- It's a common Romanian toast.

47:41.091 --> 47:44.294
To this day, this
year, this world.

47:47.064 --> 47:49.800
- Usually when I drink, I
drink to forget this world.

47:51.802 --> 47:53.337
- Too many do.

47:53.337 --> 47:56.240
People dwell on success but
success is just an outcome,

47:56.240 --> 47:58.408
a concept, it's trivial.

47:58.408 --> 48:00.544
Why focus on a goal
instead of reality?

48:01.879 --> 48:05.382
I mean, what's real, what's
crucial is right here right now.

48:05.382 --> 48:08.852
You and I here together,
not desiring anything else.

48:10.254 --> 48:11.154
Know this.

48:12.890 --> 48:13.790
- Know this.

48:15.425 --> 48:17.961
So what brings you to New York?

48:19.997 --> 48:21.565
- Curiosity.

48:21.565 --> 48:23.033
I've never been.

48:23.033 --> 48:24.534
I'm gonna be here
for two months,

48:24.534 --> 48:27.537
but I don't really have
anyone to show me around,

48:27.537 --> 48:28.572
show me the sights.

48:30.140 --> 48:31.675
I was hoping maybe you could.

48:32.542 --> 48:33.443
Be my friend.

48:35.112 --> 48:36.013
- Your friend?

48:37.547 --> 48:39.082
What does that
mean, your friend?

48:39.082 --> 48:42.219
You want something from me,
I want something from you.

48:43.687 --> 48:47.491
Usually someone is
always taken for a ride.

48:47.491 --> 48:49.626
- Maybe you've never
had the right friend.

48:50.761 --> 48:52.162
- That is for sure.

48:52.162 --> 48:56.133
- A real friendship is
one mind in two bodies.

48:58.835 --> 49:01.838
- Let's toast to
real friendship.

49:01.838 --> 49:03.640
- To real friendship.

49:03.640 --> 49:04.608
- Real friendship.

49:07.678 --> 49:09.846
- I never even left Australia
until I went to college

49:09.846 --> 49:10.747
in California.

49:12.616 --> 49:16.286
At about 21, I soon realized
just how self-serving

49:16.286 --> 49:17.454
people were, you know?

49:18.855 --> 49:21.658
Felt like I had no purpose
in life, no reason to be.

49:23.460 --> 49:26.029
So right before I was
ready to end it all

49:26.029 --> 49:28.732
and throw myself off a
roof, I had this thought.

49:30.100 --> 49:31.702
I at least owe it to
myself to see the world

49:31.702 --> 49:33.036
before I leave it, right?

49:34.137 --> 49:37.307
So I set off on a
journey, adventures.

49:37.307 --> 49:40.243
Set out to see the world,
suck the life out of the world

49:40.243 --> 49:42.779
instead of letting the world
suck the life out of me.

49:44.147 --> 49:48.118
- So becoming a global hobo
saved you from yourself?

49:49.486 --> 49:50.354
- I guess so.

49:53.590 --> 49:54.758
- Why'd you wanna die?

49:57.027 --> 49:58.328
- That was my birthright.

49:59.296 --> 50:00.764
Vindication.

50:00.764 --> 50:03.233
Can thank my parents
for that one.

50:03.233 --> 50:07.938
I started to feel my thoughts,
actions mimicking them.

50:07.938 --> 50:08.839
It terrified me.

50:10.173 --> 50:13.510
I thought I'd end up like
them, just abusive and bitter.

50:13.510 --> 50:16.179
- I can't imagine you ever
being abusive and bitter.

50:19.483 --> 50:22.719
I want to hear your
stories, stuff you've seen.

50:22.719 --> 50:27.791
- (laughs) I see a lot of
tragedy, pain, and sorrow.

50:28.458 --> 50:29.693
- You have a choice.

50:29.693 --> 50:31.294
I could choose to
see good or bad.

50:31.294 --> 50:33.864
Choose to see the good
and life can be good.

50:38.902 --> 50:41.505
- You dropped her off in a cab
when the sun was coming up?

50:42.272 --> 50:43.740
Phenomenal!

50:43.740 --> 50:45.709
Rawl, you fucking Casanova!

50:45.709 --> 50:47.711
- Don't mislead yourself, Marty.

50:47.711 --> 50:50.414
We merely engaged on a
profound conversational level.

50:50.414 --> 50:51.948
I have no romantic interest.

50:51.948 --> 50:52.916
I made that clear.

50:52.916 --> 50:54.484
- Right, right.

50:54.484 --> 50:57.387
I'm just saying it's great,
you guys are getting along.

50:57.387 --> 50:58.422
- Well, Judy's a good person.

50:58.422 --> 51:00.424
She just has a few life issues.

51:00.424 --> 51:02.159
- Yeah, and I'm one of them.

51:02.159 --> 51:04.127
- I plan to take out
Judith on the town.

51:04.127 --> 51:05.695
- Yeah, go for it,
you have my card.

51:05.695 --> 51:06.863
Holy fucking home run!

51:07.664 --> 51:08.799
- Are the Dodgers playing?

51:12.669 --> 51:13.570
- Summer.

51:14.938 --> 51:17.874
Just a few things for
your nephew, right?

51:17.874 --> 51:19.242
No distractions.

51:19.242 --> 51:22.212
You know, we need to hone
the no role models concept

51:22.212 --> 51:23.880
into a reason to let
Midway invest your money.

51:23.880 --> 51:26.383
It can't just be a diatribe
about the state of affairs.

51:26.383 --> 51:28.318
- Yeah, it should be both.

51:28.318 --> 51:29.586
More fun, less glum.

51:29.586 --> 51:30.787
- Yes.

51:30.787 --> 51:31.922
So let's brainstorm
this bitch now.

51:31.922 --> 51:32.789
- Right on.

51:33.657 --> 51:36.426
Oh, your buddy Rawl called,

51:36.426 --> 51:40.030
said something about your
Aunt Judith canceling

51:40.030 --> 51:42.699
on their date and not
wanting to see him again?

51:43.834 --> 51:45.001
Marty?

51:45.769 --> 51:46.736
What's that about?

51:47.604 --> 51:48.905
Is that talking about your mom?

51:48.905 --> 51:50.907
- No, just give me
a minute, please.

51:50.907 --> 51:51.741
Rupert.

51:51.741 --> 51:52.709
- Yeah.

51:52.709 --> 51:53.477
- I need to talk to Rawl.

51:54.811 --> 51:57.948
Well, untangle him out
of his lotus position.

51:57.948 --> 51:59.516
- [Rupert] Take a deep
breath, bud, he's right here.

51:59.516 --> 52:00.350
Hold on.

52:01.985 --> 52:03.587
- [Marty] What the
fuck's going on?

52:03.587 --> 52:04.421
- Marty?

52:04.421 --> 52:05.322
- [Marty] Yeah!

52:06.690 --> 52:09.259
- I got her asking what time
she wanted me to pick her up.

52:09.259 --> 52:11.895
She said never and told me
to never call her again.

52:11.895 --> 52:13.363
- She's just freaked
out, you know,

52:13.363 --> 52:17.567
because it's been a while since
Aunt Judy had a new friend,

52:17.567 --> 52:19.136
so just call her back.

52:19.136 --> 52:21.538
Call her back and be insistent.

52:21.538 --> 52:23.306
- Marty, I swore I'd
never impose my will

52:23.306 --> 52:25.175
on anybody ever again.

52:25.175 --> 52:26.576
- Come on.

52:26.576 --> 52:28.778
Just call her back, right?

52:29.880 --> 52:31.815
Do something big,
something romantic.

52:32.916 --> 52:34.217
- I'm sorry, Marty, okay?

52:35.318 --> 52:37.354
I understand if our
deal is now void.

52:37.354 --> 52:38.255
- Come on.

52:40.724 --> 52:43.226
You fucking tofu-eating pussy!

52:44.995 --> 52:48.031
- Marty, I can't force myself
on her like a salesman.

52:48.031 --> 52:51.334
- Oh, BS, B fucking S, man.

52:51.334 --> 52:53.503
And this is a healing
mission, remember?

52:53.503 --> 52:56.106
Why'd you call my office,
why didn't you call my cell?

52:56.106 --> 52:57.574
You're running
scared, rambling man.

52:57.574 --> 52:58.808
I mean, what are you gonna do?

52:58.808 --> 53:00.810
What, are you just
gonna go and medicate.

53:00.810 --> 53:02.879
Oops, I mean meditate
your life away?

53:03.747 --> 53:05.048
- What do you want me to do?

53:05.048 --> 53:06.516
Bang down her door?

53:06.516 --> 53:08.718
- Come on, man, if you
give up, if you give up...

53:10.053 --> 53:11.588
Don't send me a postcard.

53:13.723 --> 53:14.658
- Postcards?

53:14.658 --> 53:15.625
Who writes those anymore?

53:16.726 --> 53:17.694
Where do they even
sell postcards?

53:17.694 --> 53:18.695
It's weird.

53:23.166 --> 53:24.768
- Hey.

53:24.768 --> 53:27.704
(snaps) Are we gonna
brainstorm this bitch or what?

53:27.704 --> 53:29.439
- What time's the
presentation again tomorrow?

53:29.439 --> 53:30.540
- 9:00 a.m.

53:32.309 --> 53:34.110
- Fuck, I gotta get out
of here, I gotta go.

53:34.110 --> 53:35.078
I'll be back.

53:35.078 --> 53:36.580
Maybe I will, maybe I won't.

53:36.580 --> 53:38.215
- Not without me, you don't.

53:51.995 --> 53:52.896
- Judith!

53:54.164 --> 53:55.065
Judith!

53:59.002 --> 54:01.171
Hey!

54:02.939 --> 54:03.940
It's beautiful out here!

54:10.347 --> 54:11.414
Need a lift?

54:13.116 --> 54:14.451
Come on.

54:14.451 --> 54:15.352
- What?

54:19.522 --> 54:21.024
You've come for me?

54:21.024 --> 54:21.925
- Yes.

man I gave my heart to.

55:11.574 --> 55:13.677
Young, idealistic Gordon.

55:15.512 --> 55:18.348
I ran from him straight into
the arms of my ex-husband.

55:21.051 --> 55:22.152
- I know the feeling.

55:23.320 --> 55:24.220

56:00.690 --> 56:02.125
- [Summer] Oh yeah.

56:02.125 --> 56:03.593
This is what I'm talking about.

56:03.593 --> 56:06.763
- [Marty] I've never
had it so good.

56:06.763 --> 56:09.199
- [Summer] Marty, take
your fingers out of there.

56:09.199 --> 56:10.767
Don't you want the real thing?

56:11.901 --> 56:14.037
- [Marty] I mean,
it's so delicious.

56:14.037 --> 56:16.239
Your mother taught you right.

56:16.239 --> 56:18.041
- [Summer] When
it comes to this,

56:18.041 --> 56:20.477
there isn't anything my
mother didn't teach me.

56:21.444 --> 56:23.747
- [Marty] You want this.

56:26.549 --> 56:27.684
(phone ringing)

56:27.684 --> 56:29.085
Oh shit.

56:29.085 --> 56:30.086
- [Summer] Are you
gonna answer the phone

56:30.086 --> 56:31.554
or are you gonna give it to me?

56:37.460 --> 56:38.361
- Hello?

56:38.361 --> 56:39.396
- [Leslie] Hey, Marty!

56:41.398 --> 56:42.332
- Hey.

56:42.332 --> 56:44.701
- [Leslie] What you doing?

56:44.701 --> 56:47.303
- I am home,

56:48.405 --> 56:51.641
cooking up some ideas
for the Midway proposal.

56:52.475 --> 56:55.378
- [Leslie] Are you with anyone?

56:55.378 --> 56:56.646
- Am I...

56:56.646 --> 56:58.248
Am I with anybody?

56:58.248 --> 57:00.016
What kind of question is
that, am I with anybody?

57:00.016 --> 57:01.050
Why would I be with anybody?

57:01.050 --> 57:03.353
I'm with God, right?

57:03.353 --> 57:05.021
- [Leslie] Well, are you, Marty?

57:10.627 --> 57:13.530
- No, I'm here alone, working.

57:15.165 --> 57:16.032
- [Leslie] Where?

57:16.032 --> 57:18.401
Where are you working?

57:18.401 --> 57:19.235
- Where?

57:19.235 --> 57:21.004
I'm at my easel.

57:21.004 --> 57:23.573
I mean, meter maids aren't
gonna pay for

57:23.573 --> 57:26.609
first class tickets to Hawaii
baby. Daddy got to do his thing.

57:26.609 --> 57:28.478
- [Leslie] Prove it.

57:28.478 --> 57:30.880
I want to hear your
computer make some noise.

57:30.880 --> 57:32.215
- Computer noise?

57:32.215 --> 57:34.484
Come on, baby, you
don't trust me?

57:34.484 --> 57:38.922
- [Leslie] I want to
hear some noise, Marty!

57:38.922 --> 57:41.257
(clicking)

57:43.193 --> 57:44.327
Well, even if you're
at the computer,

57:44.327 --> 57:46.429
doesn't mean that you're alone.

57:46.429 --> 57:48.898
Okay, I want to hear you scream
from the top of your lungs

57:48.898 --> 57:50.366
that you love me.

57:50.366 --> 57:53.303
- Babe, I mean, isn't
this just a little silly?

57:53.303 --> 57:54.137
- [Leslie] Who's there?

57:54.137 --> 57:55.805
- I love you!

57:55.805 --> 57:57.006
- [Leslie] Again.

57:57.006 --> 58:00.977
- I love you, I love
you, love you, love you!

58:00.977 --> 58:01.945
Fuck!

58:01.945 --> 58:02.779
- Bitch--

58:02.779 --> 58:04.514
- It's okay, it's okay.

58:04.514 --> 58:06.015
- Oh my god!

58:06.015 --> 58:08.985
(shouting)

58:08.985 --> 58:10.320
- Summer, get out of here.

58:10.320 --> 58:11.221
Summer.

58:12.655 --> 58:14.858
Get out.

58:14.858 --> 58:18.061
Stop it, stop it, just get out.

58:18.061 --> 58:20.196
(smacks)

58:27.470 --> 58:29.806
- You look like a million pesos.

58:29.806 --> 58:32.308
What happened after
I left last night?

58:32.308 --> 58:34.310
- Well, the good news is I
made up with her at 5:00 a.m.

58:34.310 --> 58:37.113
And the bad news is she
says I have to fire you.

58:37.113 --> 58:37.947
- Ha!

58:37.947 --> 58:39.115
That's funny.

58:39.115 --> 58:41.050
You're lucky I
don't sue your ass.

58:41.050 --> 58:42.585
Okay, they're all
waiting in there for you.

58:42.585 --> 58:44.587
I told them that you
were polishing stats.

58:44.587 --> 58:45.822
You do have stats?

58:48.091 --> 58:49.325
That's what I thought.

58:49.325 --> 58:51.094
Thank god I looked
them up for you.

58:51.094 --> 58:51.961
Shall we?

58:56.933 --> 58:58.101
- Hey, guys.

58:58.101 --> 59:01.337
Sorry I'm late, I was just...

59:01.337 --> 59:02.171
- Oh!

59:02.171 --> 59:03.339
Marty.

59:03.339 --> 59:04.741
- I got it, I got it.

59:04.741 --> 59:06.042
Start talking, say
something, say something.

59:06.042 --> 59:07.343
- Mr. Milk, hello.

59:07.343 --> 59:09.479
Can I get anybody any drinks?

59:09.479 --> 59:10.813
- Summer, please, take a seat.

59:10.813 --> 59:13.716
Marty, we have all seen
great work from you

59:13.716 --> 59:15.051
in the juvenile division.

59:15.051 --> 59:16.519
- Thanks, Lee.

59:16.519 --> 59:18.955
- What do you propose for the
Midway Investment account?

59:18.955 --> 59:20.557
- Well, you know, Midway, right?

59:20.557 --> 59:24.861
Midway Investment Firm,
Midway Investors, Midway.

59:25.662 --> 59:28.531
Who is the Midway investor?

59:28.531 --> 59:29.899
You know, I don't know, right?

59:29.899 --> 59:31.701
Who the hell are these assholes?

59:31.701 --> 59:33.536
- You're talking
to one right here.

59:36.606 --> 59:37.707
- I'll be right back.

59:41.044 --> 59:42.245
- Oh.

59:42.245 --> 59:43.880
Maybe we got the
wrong guy for this.

59:43.880 --> 59:46.783
- No, Marty is absolutely
the right guy for this.

59:46.783 --> 59:51.854
I mean, he has some really
advanced angles on this thing.

59:52.655 --> 59:53.990
- Hey, everyone!

59:53.990 --> 59:55.858
I got some toys, guys.

59:57.594 --> 59:59.228
Playtime, everyone.

59:59.228 --> 01:00:00.129
Everyone play.

01:00:01.564 --> 01:00:02.498
What's the matter?

01:00:02.498 --> 01:00:04.033
You've forgotten how to play?

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:06.469
Look, we're trying to have a
sophisticated meeting here,

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:09.872
now back in the 80s when
the dudes and dudettes

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:11.174
that Midway's trying to target,

01:00:11.174 --> 01:00:13.710
when they were primetime
TV loving kids,

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.912
I was the undisputed
king of cool.

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:17.547
Never needed a gun
to solve my problems.

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:19.115
There wasn't a jam I
couldn't get out of

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:21.117
with a little ingenuity
and a paperclip.

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:23.886
I was their role model
who convinced them

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:26.789
there is always an easy way out.

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:29.592
They were convinced that
easy times would open arms,

01:00:29.592 --> 01:00:32.028
lay ahead, but when
they got out of college,

01:00:32.028 --> 01:00:36.132
they got welcomed into the
adult world full of indecision.

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:39.769
The 9/11, the terrorism,
and a clueless president

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:43.439
and weapons of financial
destruction, no decent jobs,

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:46.676
and the promise of being the
first American generation

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:49.779
to have a worse quality of
life than their parents.

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:51.180
What kind of life is that?

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.548
I don't know, I'm outta here!

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:55.151
That's a life that I don't want.

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:59.355
Well, that may be so, Marty.

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:00.189
Don't hit me now.

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:00.990
Well, why isn't there?

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:02.025
It's not my fault.

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:02.859
Whose fault is it?

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:05.561
See, I believe
trust is dead.

01:01:05.561 --> 01:01:08.197
We need the Midway
campaign to focus

01:01:08.197 --> 01:01:11.034
on the absence of role models.

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:21.144
- In the 25 years that I've
been running this company,

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:26.983
I can't think of a more
original, unique presentation.

01:01:29.352 --> 01:01:33.656
Generation brought up without
a credible role model.

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:35.324
I like the premise.

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:39.495
Suppose we were to invent
the ideal role model

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:44.000
and then market it directly
to this lost generation.

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:47.503
Think that's something you
can come up with, Marty?

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:51.107
- Of course it is, Mr. Milk.

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:52.909
- Five companies bidding
for the same job,

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:55.011
so Monday I'd like
to hear very much

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:57.180
what your idea for the
spokesman might be.

01:01:58.648 --> 01:01:59.515
Good luck.

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:02.685
- You really pulled it off.

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:04.987
I don't know how you
did, but you did it.

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:10.226
So to get the low
self-esteemer to invest,

01:02:10.226 --> 01:02:12.228
we need to understand
how they learned

01:02:12.228 --> 01:02:14.864
to not value themselves
in the first place.

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:17.600
(phone ringing)

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:20.603
- You got Marty.

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:22.739
- She's a fountain girl!

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:23.639
- Rawl?

01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:24.574
Fountain girl?

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:25.908
What are you talking about?

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:26.876
- Judith.

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.177
My wonder entered her garden

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:30.847
and then I discovered
her life flow.

01:02:30.847 --> 01:02:33.549
Marty, the French say if
you find a fountain girl,

01:02:33.549 --> 01:02:35.418
you'll forever bathe in love.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:36.953
Pierre is right.

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:38.588
Marty, it was like having
a hot bottle of champagne

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.023
just exploded all over my face!

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:43.326
- A bottle of hot
champagne on your face?

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:45.261
What are you talking about?

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:47.563
- Sounds like female
ejaculation to me.

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:50.566
- She was deep in passion
and I was gripped in fear,

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:52.068
holding onto the bedposts.

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:54.270
She guided my kisses
down to her garden

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.738
and my tongue tickled her joy.

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:58.307
And soon came a sudden whoosh!

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:00.276
I mean, I'd heard it in
France about fountain girls,

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.944
but I didn't think it was true.

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.780
- Shh, stop talking, please.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.215
- Oh, Marty, I was so excited
that my force was unleashed

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:09.418
and she wasn't even
touching my wonder.

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:10.753
- Look, no more
talking about force.

01:03:10.753 --> 01:03:12.889
Please, just calm
down and slow down.

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:14.423
- I mean, it was an
emotional journey.

01:03:14.423 --> 01:03:18.427
We held nothing back in
mind, in body, in soul.

01:03:18.427 --> 01:03:19.662
We shared everything!

01:03:19.662 --> 01:03:22.365
I mean secrets, dreams, desires.

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:23.666
- Wait, desires?

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:24.901
- Marty, this is it.

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.702
I mean, this is what
being in love is.

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:28.704
It's not being afraid.

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:31.174
And finally, finally this is it.

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:32.642
- What are you talking about?

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:35.244
- She spoke of past
loves, even tragedies.

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:36.746
- Tragedies, what tragedies?

01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:40.149
- She spoke of Gordon, young
love she had when she was 22.

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:42.885
Some idealistic
motorcyclist dropout,

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:44.120
used to write a novel a week.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:45.988
I mean, her family hated him.

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.790
Her father convinced him
that it would kill him

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:49.458
if they got married.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.060
So she went and married
the first college boy

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.128
she could find.

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:53.296
Nervous New Yorker.

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:54.931
- Yes, yes, exactly,
right, right.

01:03:54.931 --> 01:03:57.266
Who she divorced
when her son was five

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:59.035
because she found him cheating.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:00.236
- Yes, yes!

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:01.871
But no, she was the
one doing the cheating.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:02.705
Hey, how do you know?

01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:04.440
- She was cheating?

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.741
Wait, wait, wait, who
the hell is Gordon?

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:08.110
My dad was the first
love of her life.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.078
- Your dad?

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:12.248
Aunt Judy's my mom, you
fucking French found fuck.

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:14.050
- What?

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:17.086
I had sex with your mom?

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:18.321
- Yes.

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:20.890
And it sounds like you
liked it, motherfucker.

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:23.926
- I don't believe this.

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:24.827
- Believe it!

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:27.296
I thought...

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:28.764
I'm a freak.

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:30.233
I thought it would, I
don't know what I thought.

01:04:30.233 --> 01:04:32.401
I'm sorry, man, I should
have been straight with you.

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:33.736
You can keep the money...

01:04:33.736 --> 01:04:35.605
- I don't know what
to say except...

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:38.674
Except thank you.

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:39.575
- Thank you?

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:42.011
Thank you?

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:44.814
- Marty, you can keep the money.

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.716
I never thought I'd
say these three words.

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.117
I'm in love!

01:04:48.117 --> 01:04:49.418
- You're not in love, man.

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.320
You're talking about
my mom, alright?

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.322
She collects rubber bands.

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:54.523
- No, I am in love.

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:56.225
Marty, she opened up
something inside of me.

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.027
- Just stop talking about
anything being opened up

01:04:58.027 --> 01:05:00.196
inside of you, please, okay?

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:02.231
- She is like an
epic living novel.

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:03.366
I can't put her down, I won't.

01:05:03.366 --> 01:05:04.567
- Rawl, stop!

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.068
I don't want to hear
any more of the bullshit

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:07.303
about you sticking the fucking
wonder in her fucking garden

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:08.938
and if there's any more
(mumbles) fucking face

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:10.473
about how you lost
your fucking dick.

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:12.108
You're celibate, you haven't
has sex for 10 fucking years

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:13.609
you motherfucker.

01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:15.611
Rawl, stop talking about
fucking my fucking mother!

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:22.618
- So sweet.

01:05:22.618 --> 01:05:24.453
And it's not even Mother's Day.

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:25.521
- You must go!

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:35.064
(knocking)

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:43.572
(kissing)

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:44.473
- I have a gift.

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:49.545
(speaking in foreign language)

01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:50.780
- You cooked.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.448
- Traveling on a budget,
you learn some things.

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:54.317
This is my favorite dish.

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:56.953
Couscous taught to me
by Kabal Kan Katak.

01:05:56.953 --> 01:05:59.121
He's the leader of an
anti-Taliban force.

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:03.125
This couscous has recruited
more men than Uncle Sam.

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:03.960
- Let me take your coat.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.728
- Oh, thank you.

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:08.264
- You've really done some
stuff, you know that?

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:11.267
You should write a novel.

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:12.835
- It would be incomplete.

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:16.138
I'm living the most
exciting chapter now.

01:06:16.138 --> 01:06:18.941
- (laughs) I'm sorry,
it's such a mess and...

01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:20.943
I had no time to clean up.

01:06:20.943 --> 01:06:22.178
- No, it doesn't
look too bad at all.

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:23.913
- I've got this dinner here.

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.047
I don't know if you'll
like my cooking.

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:26.349
- Hey, who's that?

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:28.751
- Oh yeah, that's my
fucking ex-husband.

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:30.619
He's such an asshole.

01:06:31.754 --> 01:06:33.622
I mean, he was in the
best pictures of Marty

01:06:33.622 --> 01:06:36.258
so I had to cut the
prick's head off.

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:37.727
Too bad it wasn't his prick.

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:40.629
Marty?

01:06:40.629 --> 01:06:41.897
That's my son, you know.

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:44.166
He's the same age as you.

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:46.369
- Oh.

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:47.903
- (laughs) Yeah.

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:49.772
I hope that when he comes into
town, we can all have dinner.

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:51.741
(screams)

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.075
- Oh god.

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:54.343
- [Judith] It's okay, it's okay.

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:55.544
- [Rawl] Don't touch
it, it's ruined.

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:56.479
- No, it's okay.

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:57.546
- No, I made a mess everywhere.

01:06:57.546 --> 01:06:58.614
I think I should just go.

01:06:58.614 --> 01:07:00.082
- No, no, no, no!

01:07:00.082 --> 01:07:02.318
It's just one less dish to wash,
what are you talking about?

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:03.519
Fuck it, let's just go.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:05.021
There's a restaurant
right around the corner

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.956
that I've always wanted
to check out and...

01:07:08.257 --> 01:07:11.093
You said that we would
create our own path.

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:15.731
- Everything happens
for a reason, right?

01:07:16.665 --> 01:07:18.567
- Yeah, not
necessarily a good one.

01:07:19.902 --> 01:07:22.204
I always hated that
New Age bullshit,

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.473
but coming from you
it's worth listening to.

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:28.144
(kisses)

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:30.279
You're such a goon,
you know that?

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.747
What do you see in me?

01:07:33.449 --> 01:07:35.217
- I see everything.

01:07:59.108 --> 01:07:59.975
Lunch.

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:04.213
(kisses)

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:05.448
- Could get used to this.

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:21.529
I could get used to this?

01:08:42.917 --> 01:08:46.188
- Summer, I am way
overloaded on accounts.

01:08:46.188 --> 01:08:48.756
I am promoting you from my
assistant to creative director

01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:51.227
and you're gonna be responsible
for Sour Licks Candy

01:08:51.227 --> 01:08:52.627
and Bigkidsworld.com.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:54.630
- Are you shitting me?

01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:57.899
Can you do that?

01:08:57.899 --> 01:08:58.801
- Absolutely not.

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:02.337
But I've gotta do it if we're
gonna land our firm Midway.

01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:03.772
I'll beg Milk.

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:06.207
But for now it's just
gonna be our little secret.

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:07.977
- Me likey.

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:11.846
But I still want in on
the Midway account, okay?

01:09:11.846 --> 01:09:13.916
Which reminds me, let me get
you those Austin weeklies.

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:15.618
I've been hunting
them down forever.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:22.390
- Thank you.

01:09:45.046 --> 01:09:46.549
- Don't say a word.

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:49.084
Just put on some rags and
grab yourself a roller.

01:09:54.156 --> 01:09:56.125
- No one gets in
the fashion show

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:57.326
unless they're on the list.

01:09:57.326 --> 01:09:59.461
(shouting)

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:00.696
- Ladies, how you doing?

01:10:00.696 --> 01:10:02.398
Hey, I'm with one of the
models, Leslie White?

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:05.768
- I know these
bitches are skinny,

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:08.737
but unless she's invisible,
I'd say you're on your own.

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:11.440
- Come on, hawk, I
just need to get by.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.809
- My my my my my my.

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:17.646
Haven't seen you at one of
these outings in donkey's years.

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:19.882
He's with us.

01:10:20.849 --> 01:10:22.918
(sighs)

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:24.587
- In you go.

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:25.421
- You're a prince.

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:27.022
- Queen, honey.

01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.290
I'm a queen.

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:29.325
- Oh, yes, you are.

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:43.505
- (gasps) Marty!

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:45.207
What are you doing here?

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:47.243
You surprised me.

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:48.978
Hey.

01:10:48.978 --> 01:10:50.479
These new bitches dress so slow

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:51.780
it's making us all look bad.

01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:53.182
I hope they take as
many pictures of me

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:55.050
as they did the girl before me.

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.285
- Are you kidding?

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:57.820
I saw more flashes than
the fourth of July.

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:01.023
- Oh (kisses), what
would I do without you?

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.597
- What would you do?

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:09.865
- [Leslie] I don't know.

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:16.705
- Leslie, I'm here because I...

01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:22.544
Because I need to
close our relationship.

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:27.049
- (laughs) God, Marty, I never
know when you're playing.

01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:28.817
- I'm not playing.

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:29.952
I'm not playing.

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:35.424
- What?

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:38.494
- You know what, I tried to
do what you wanted me to do.

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:42.097
I pieced together a
PR portfolio about you

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:44.767
to show some of my
fancy magazine friends

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:47.770
and so I searched for
some of the restaurant ads

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.938
that you said you
did back in Austin.

01:11:49.938 --> 01:11:51.840
You know, and like
this is what I found.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.975
It's just like...

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:54.343
I just, I...

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:59.715
Mandy Hot Talk, XXX.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:00.949
Hot, right?

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:03.686
I guess you're just
good with your words.

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:05.187
(laughs)

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:09.925
I don't need your deceit or
your manipulation anymore.

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:14.196
I'm tired of wasting
my fucking time for you

01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:16.465
and you're just
driving me all over

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:18.300
and it just doesn't
work, you know?

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.169
- Why is it, Marty,
that I never know

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:22.871
what you're really
feeling unless you're
screaming about it?

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:24.707
Because you have
no balls, Marty,

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:27.176
that's why I never know what
you're fucking thinking.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:29.578
And so I fibbed on a resume.

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.247
You're a fucking liar,
that's what you are.

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:35.417
Lied about loving me, lied
about respecting me in any way,

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:37.286
and you lied about
believing in me.

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:38.854
All you had to do was
make a phone call, Marty.

01:12:38.854 --> 01:12:40.756
- I tried to do what
you wanted to do!

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:41.790
- Fuck you.

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:43.625
Fuck you every fucking day.

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:45.227
I give two shits about you.

01:12:45.227 --> 01:12:47.696
You're too much of a pussy
to ever get some balls

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.732
and change for yourself!

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:51.700
And I will never
spend another moment

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.470
with tears coming down my
eyes for your fucking mess.

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:55.371
How about that?

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:58.640
(applauds)

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:01.143
- I can still make a few calls.

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:05.047
- Did you get all
of that on tape?

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:05.981
Yes.

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.082
- Can I talk to you for a sec?

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:09.985
We need someone on
set behind the scenes

01:13:09.985 --> 01:13:12.921
to publicize what it's like
to advertise with the stars,

01:13:12.921 --> 01:13:14.123
you know?

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:16.825
Someone with a top fashion blog.

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:19.361
- I love Justin Bibi.

01:13:19.361 --> 01:13:20.896
Who must I kill?

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:23.766
- Just type some hype on
Leslie's lingerie line, okay,

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:25.501
and you got a deal.

01:13:25.501 --> 01:13:27.102
- Okay, how perfect.

01:13:27.102 --> 01:13:28.237
I can do that, yes.

01:13:30.072 --> 01:13:33.041
- I had this theory that if
you ever had an experience

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:37.780
where you felt like you can
sense other people's thoughts?

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.249
- Yes.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.684
I'm certain that's how
certain animals communicate.

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:43.886
I also think in a way

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:46.155
that we choose our
own facial structure.

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.589
- You're definitely a lion.

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.291
- Really?

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:53.128
- What do you think I am?

01:13:58.867 --> 01:13:59.968
- Something in water.

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:03.305
Definitely with wings.

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:10.846
You're a swan.

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:14.550
- (laughs) You are real.

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.252
I said something to you
before, I must have.

01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:18.487
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:19.988
You're so graceful
and proud and...

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:21.990
Regal.

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:25.027
- This is too much.

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:29.231
When my father was still alive,

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:31.667
he would take me every
Sunday to Prospect Park

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:35.971
and we would pass the
swans in the lake.

01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:40.275
He would fall silent and
become mesmerized by them.

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:45.714
It was something that I never
saw in him anywhere else.

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:49.051
I knew that if I wanted
to catch the love of a man

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:52.821
like my father, I
had to be a swan.

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:58.961
He was solid, always
knew what to do.

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:02.030
His advice was golden.

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:03.432
If he'd only lived longer,

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:07.469
I probably wouldn't have
made all the stupid mistakes

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:08.370
that I made.

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:12.608
It's because I had no
one to consult with.

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:19.047
I've been foolish
most of my life.

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:33.829
Have you ever been
in love, Rawl?

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:37.132
- Once.

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:39.434
- Why did you leave her?

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:42.104
- I was weak.

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:53.382
- I've decided that
the no role models idea

01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:58.520
is a craptastic idea, right?

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:01.089
Let me tell you why.

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:05.894
Because see, most people
are pathetic, you know?

01:16:06.695 --> 01:16:07.663
They're either lying to someone

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:10.599
or they're lying to themselves.

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:12.834
We're gonna get 'em
from a different...

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:15.938
We're gonna give 'em
someone who tells the truth.

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:18.807
Someone who's not
afraid to tell them

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:21.777
what the fuck is up, right?

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:25.447
And we'll call this
guy Mr. Absolute Truth.

01:16:25.447 --> 01:16:27.983
And we'll put him in situations

01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:30.018
that everyone can identify with.

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:32.087
Like let's say you're
going to your boss

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:33.555
and you need a little
itty bitty raise.

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.090
"I've been working really,
really hard for you

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.392
and just want to take my
wife on a cruise to Alaska

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:38.894
and I think it'd be great--"

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:40.128
No!

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:42.164
And we throw in our guy.

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:45.701
Mr. Absolute Truth Man,
here to save the day!

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:48.003
"Listen, boss man, alright,
bust me out a raise

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:49.504
or I'm gonna take my ass,

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:51.006
I'm gonna run off to the
competition, comprende?"

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:53.475
How about another scene
where a guy's girlfriend

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:57.145
won't oblige him with a
little BJ, just a little one.

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:59.014
He's gonna have to sit
in the middle of the bed

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.849
and just masturbate
while she's sleeping

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:02.217
in the middle of
the fucking night.

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:04.052
And he says to her "Sweetheart,
now I would appreciate

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:06.021
a little hummer if you
just would go downtown

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:07.556
and make things a
little bit easier for me.

01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:08.824
I'd really
appreciate it, baby."

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:11.660
Absolute Truth comes in
and says "Listen, baby.

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:14.763
Either bust out a blowjob
or I will go get a pro

01:17:14.763 --> 01:17:17.332
come and guzzle my shit like
champagne, click, click."

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:18.233
Boom!

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:20.369
Hold on, I got the best one.

01:17:20.369 --> 01:17:22.137
This is one we can
all identify with.

01:17:22.137 --> 01:17:24.373
How about you got
a guy who has a,

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:26.041
let's just say a nagging sister.

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:28.043
She's a class A
complainer, alright?

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:30.178
A real fucking woo!

01:17:30.178 --> 01:17:33.515
"I give you love all my
life and nobody loves me."

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:36.418
She's just nagging the
shit out of him, right?

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:39.621
And so our guy, he hires
his buddy to date her

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:41.256
and to take her and bingo!

01:17:41.256 --> 01:17:43.625
The fucking sister's off his
ass and the problem is solved.

01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:44.893
You wanna know why?

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:45.861
Because this guy had the
money, he had the money!

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:46.962
How'd he get the money, Greg?

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:48.230
I'll answer the question.

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.899
He got the money because
he invests with Midway.

01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:52.100
Boom!

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.302
That's it, money solved
the fucking problem.

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:55.604
And here's the tagline.

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:57.372
Afraid to invest with Midway?

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:59.608
Then you don't deserve money.

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:01.977
It's a no excuses
campaign, right?

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:04.913
You got the balls and
we'll get you the money!

01:18:06.948 --> 01:18:08.216
- Meeting's over.

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:09.117
Out.

01:18:11.019 --> 01:18:13.255
(humming)

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:18.927
Sit down.

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:20.696
Take a seat.

01:18:22.864 --> 01:18:24.800
I gather you're under
a little bit of stress.

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:27.102
What's going on?

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:29.938
- It's me.

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:33.241
- Excuse me?

01:18:33.241 --> 01:18:34.309
- It's my mess.

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:36.545
- Who the hell
else's would it be?

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:41.550
- Everybody else's...
I thought.

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.653
All I wanted was just
to nail this campaign.

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:47.022
You know, I just
don't want to be stuck

01:18:47.022 --> 01:18:49.558
making kids commercials
for the rest of my life!

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:50.392
- Calm down.

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:51.626
- I can't calm down.

01:18:51.626 --> 01:18:53.428
If I'm calm, people
just walk all over me.

01:18:53.428 --> 01:18:54.996
I just let them walk all over me

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:56.565
and I can't be
walked over anymore.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:57.666
I've got to do this.

01:18:57.666 --> 01:18:59.434
I want Midway, I need Midway,

01:18:59.434 --> 01:19:02.070
and I don't know why I just
couldn't fucking do it!

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.971
- Grow up!

01:19:04.372 --> 01:19:05.674
God's sakes.

01:19:06.975 --> 01:19:08.710
You're great with
the kids stuff.

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:11.246
So you hit a wall.

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:14.149
It's not the end of the
world, it's not defeat.

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:15.617
I've seen people waste
their entire lives

01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:18.620
trying to become something that
they're never gonna become.

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:22.057
So maybe this is who you are.

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:23.892
Maybe you're the little kid guy.

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:28.697
- No, no, you're not
getting me, Mr. Milk.

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:32.868
- I get that you are
out of your depth here

01:19:32.868 --> 01:19:35.237
and that you're off of Midway.

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:37.139
- I'm either off
Midway or I'm fired?

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:40.142
Then I guess I'm fired.

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:44.079
- Talent is a harder thing
to ride than pity is.

01:19:46.047 --> 01:19:46.948
It's your call.

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:59.461
- How about I take my
vacation time next week

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.930
and I earn back
the Midway account?

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:07.402
- Oh, what the hell.

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.272
Everybody fucks up once, right?

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.875
I know I did. (laughs)

01:20:13.875 --> 01:20:17.612
Thanks for the driving
directions to Palm Springs.

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:21.049
I will have my cell, but
I am not checking email.

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:22.551
- Okay.

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:24.886
Well, I will be available
24-7 to bounce ideas off of.

01:20:25.954 --> 01:20:27.455
- I might just take
you up on that.

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:30.926
But please, please do not
give out my hotel information

01:20:30.926 --> 01:20:33.328
to anyone, especially my mom.

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:34.496
- Okay.

01:20:34.496 --> 01:20:35.831
Go, mad man, go.

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:40.535
(phone ringing)

01:20:40.535 --> 01:20:41.636
- [Recording] You got
Marty's home phone,

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:42.871
tell me something good.

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:46.274
(crying)

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:55.016
- Mom, are you okay?

01:20:55.016 --> 01:20:56.484
- I'm not okay.

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:58.153
I'm not okay, I'm
not okay, I'm not--

01:20:58.153 --> 01:20:58.987
- Rawl?

01:20:58.987 --> 01:20:59.955
What the fuck?

01:20:59.955 --> 01:21:01.156
- She said if I truly loved her,

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:02.357
I'd understand and
I'd stop bugging her,

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:03.491
but I don't understand,
I don't understand.

01:21:03.491 --> 01:21:05.827
I mean, I want to see her.

01:21:05.827 --> 01:21:06.795
I need to see her.

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:09.130
You must have told
her about our deal.

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:10.999
- I didn't tell her shit.

01:21:10.999 --> 01:21:12.634
- I've never needed
anyone before.

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:13.935
It hurts.

01:21:13.935 --> 01:21:15.770
I can't take it, I
need to make it stop.

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.205
- You're overreacting.

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:19.441
She's probably just
playing hard to get again.

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:21.576
- She put call
blocking on my number.

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:23.578
- Oh.

01:21:23.578 --> 01:21:25.180
- Can't take it.

01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:29.618
I can't take it, I can't
take it, I can't take it,

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:30.418
I can't take it!

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:32.120
- So don't take it, man.

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:37.325
- Okay.

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:38.193
- Okay what?

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:41.062
- I won't take it.

01:21:43.798 --> 01:21:45.867
(sighs)

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:48.503
- How you gonna do that?

01:21:50.171 --> 01:21:51.072
- Sorry, Marty.

01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:53.975
I've ruined everything.

01:21:53.975 --> 01:21:54.910
- Not your fault.

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:57.178
It's mine.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.048
- I will make these
feelings stop.

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:06.388
- Rawl, you're not gonna do
anything stupid, are you?

01:22:07.155 --> 01:22:09.724
- I'll make them stop.

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:11.927
(dial tone)

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:12.827
- What?

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:16.197
(calm music)

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:32.314
(knocking)

01:22:36.651 --> 01:22:37.919
- Come on, come on, come on.

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:39.621
We are fucked, we are fucked.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.089
He's been gone

01:22:41.089 --> 01:22:42.324
since you got off the
phone with him yesterday.

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:43.959
I have no concept
of where he is.

01:22:43.959 --> 01:22:44.793
- I do.

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:45.627
- The laundromat?

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.162
- Why, does he stink?

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:48.730
- No, actually I liked
the way he smells.

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:51.132
It smells like baseball cards
fresh out of the package.

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:52.367
It's nice.

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:53.601
The laundromat,
that's a good place

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:56.237
Something about all
those clothes are
going round and round

01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:57.439
and they're sudsy.

01:22:57.439 --> 01:22:58.974
And the more they
spin, the more you see.

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:01.710
The more you see, so, okay,
he thinks he's in love, right?

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:02.544
- No.

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:03.979
I've been there before.

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:06.581
It's not love anymore.

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:07.816
- Alright, you're right.

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:09.784
Maybe love has a way
of tilting into crazy.

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:11.553
- Fuck, man, we gotta find him.

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:13.588
In college, I had to talk
him out of killing himself

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:14.756
almost every semester.

01:23:14.756 --> 01:23:16.191
- Oh.

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:17.325
Well, I checked the laundry
room and the basement,

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:18.526
I called the laundromat
down the block.

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:20.628
- He's not at a
fucking laundromat!

01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:22.097
- Then he doesn't know
what he's missing.

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:24.499
- Look, he's probably just
lurking around my mom's place.

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:25.533
- You think he's
gonna drop the bomb,

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:26.401
tell your mom he's your whore?

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:27.635
- I don't think so.

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:28.503
I mean, that's what
I love about him,

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:29.504
he'd never hurt anyone.

01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:30.405
- Or pay them to.

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:32.841
- Thanks.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:33.975
I guess that's what
I'm born to do.

01:23:33.975 --> 01:23:35.543
- Come on, buddy, I'm sorry.

01:23:35.543 --> 01:23:37.912
I've seen those bananas
for brains ads you wrote.

01:23:37.912 --> 01:23:40.048
♪ Bananas for brains,
bananas for brains ♪

01:23:40.048 --> 01:23:42.684
♪ You can think all you want
but it's bananas the same ♪

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.119
- It's cute, you're
a sweetheart.

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:46.121
- Rupert, I know you're
afraid to leave this apartment,

01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:48.523
but I need your help
searching for him.

01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:49.958
Can you handle the outside?

01:23:52.627 --> 01:23:53.528
You can.

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:56.798
- I used to be afraid,
but now I'm like afraid

01:23:56.798 --> 01:23:58.666
of not being afraid, it's
a whole other level of--

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.235
- Right, are you coming or not?

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.440
- Yes.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.475
Yes, yes.

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:10.345
I'm coming, but I'm gonna
need you to hold my hand

01:24:10.345 --> 01:24:12.914
because I haven't left
this building in 27 months.

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.050
Please hold my hand.

01:24:20.622 --> 01:24:21.456
- [Marty] You okay?

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:22.357
- Yeah, yeah.

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:30.265
Oh, do you think we can
get some ice cream later?

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:42.510
- Hey, guy.

01:24:43.845 --> 01:24:45.213
Guy.

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:46.047
Buddy, over here.

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:47.649
- What?

01:24:47.649 --> 01:24:49.417
- It wouldn't kill you
to order something.

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:51.352
- If only suicide was that easy.

01:24:51.352 --> 01:24:52.353
- We're fresh out of cyanide.

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:54.122
How about an espresso?

01:24:54.122 --> 01:24:55.023
- Why not?

01:24:58.226 --> 01:25:00.195
- So you keeping your eyes
peeled on the other side

01:25:00.195 --> 01:25:01.196
of the street, man?

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:03.198
- Yeah.

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:04.566
It's nice being out.

01:25:04.566 --> 01:25:06.101
I'm really set being inside.

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:10.972
It's just a solid feeling,
not needing anything.

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:15.009
- So does this mean I can
let go of your fucking hand?

01:25:15.009 --> 01:25:16.044
- No!

01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:18.313
No, no, no, no!

01:25:18.313 --> 01:25:19.147
No.

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:20.748
- Okay.

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:22.217
Come on.

01:25:22.217 --> 01:25:24.552
(clinking)

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:28.790
- Hey, easy, maestro.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:30.225
Hey, relax.

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:32.327
You slugged back enough
caffeine to wire a small city.

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:33.661
Hey, you're done.

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:34.963
I'm cutting your
ass off, this is it.

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:36.498
$37.12.

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:38.900
- Why not?

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:43.438
(cheers)

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:47.809
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:49.043
Get down, get down.

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:50.612
Come on, man, get
off the counter.

01:25:50.612 --> 01:25:51.513
Not on the walls!

01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:54.015
- Why not?

01:25:54.015 --> 01:25:55.250
- Don't touch the customers.

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:56.184
- Why not?

01:25:56.184 --> 01:25:57.285
- Don't touch the customers.

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:59.454
No, come on, no, no.

01:25:59.454 --> 01:26:00.722
Hey, what did I just say?

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:03.458
Hey, I just said no
customers, no customers.

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:05.994
Alright, show's over, okay, pal?

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:07.962
Show's over, you're done,
you're done, you're out of here.

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:10.165
Go home, take a powder, buddy.

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:11.065
- Why not?

01:26:11.065 --> 01:26:12.534
Why not?

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:15.036
Why not!

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:17.605
- Yeah, and people say
"Oh, it's a bad thing,"

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:19.541
the internet making it
easy for guys like me

01:26:19.541 --> 01:26:20.875
to stay at home.

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.177
I think they're right, you know?

01:26:22.177 --> 01:26:24.846
It's kind of fun getting
out in the world.

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:27.482
(laughs) I really like it.

01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:34.088
- Because if you do, I'll
knock your ass backwards.

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:34.989
- Why not?

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:43.765
- Rawl in his undies.

01:26:43.765 --> 01:26:44.699
Rawl in his undies!

01:26:44.699 --> 01:26:46.467
That's Rawl, Rawl in his undies!

01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:48.036
- I gotta put you down.

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:50.071
- Oh, oh.
- Shit.

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.008
Oh, I'm outside.

01:26:54.008 --> 01:26:58.780
I'm touching the ground,
I'm touching the ground!

01:26:59.447 --> 01:27:00.248
- Got another asshole.

01:27:00.248 --> 01:27:05.119
- Let's get this nutjob.

01:27:06.888 --> 01:27:08.656
- Then he goes like this.

01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:11.326
Come on, cut him on that side.

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:12.994
Son of a bitch.

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:19.167
- Rawl.

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:20.602
There he goes.

01:27:20.602 --> 01:27:21.502
- Stay right there.

01:27:22.437 --> 01:27:23.438
Up against the car, let's go.

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:24.806
- Wait, wait!

01:27:24.806 --> 01:27:26.074
- [Rupert] Police
brutality, police brutality!

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:28.009
- What happened, what happened?

01:27:28.009 --> 01:27:29.978
- She took the love away man.

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:30.912
- Police brutality!

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:31.913
- Hey, stay the hell back.

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:34.048
- Okay, okay, okay!

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:34.983
- Where are you taking him?

01:27:34.983 --> 01:27:36.184
- He's going to second precinct.

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:37.218
- It's alright, Rawl.

01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:38.820
- No peace, no justice.

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:39.988
No peace, no justice!

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:40.989
- Shut up.

01:27:40.989 --> 01:27:43.191
Just shut up.

01:27:43.191 --> 01:27:44.125
Shut up.

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:44.959
- [Rupert] No peace, no justice!

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:46.294
- Shut up!

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:47.729
(punches)

01:27:47.729 --> 01:27:48.630
- I needed that.

01:27:54.035 --> 01:27:55.903
- [Marty] So he's
gonna be okay, right?

01:27:55.903 --> 01:27:57.272
- He seems fine for right now,

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:58.506
but we're holding him overnight.

01:27:58.506 --> 01:28:00.375
If he passes the
psych evaluation,

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:02.443
the judge will let him
out with counseling.

01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:04.212
If he can pay the $1,800 fine.

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:07.482
- I got that covered.

01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:10.752
So where do I pick
him up tomorrow?

01:28:10.752 --> 01:28:12.353
- Tomorrow?

01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:14.088
He's gotta go
through the system.

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:16.457
He ain't gonna be out
for at least three days.

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:17.792
- You said he's fine.

01:28:17.792 --> 01:28:19.627
Why is it gonna take three days?

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:21.095
- Don't ask me.

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:24.098
That's just the way they've
always done things around here.

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:28.970
(calm music)

01:28:32.473 --> 01:28:33.374
- Mom?

01:28:34.175 --> 01:28:35.743
It's me, it's Marty, you here?

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.448
Mom!

01:28:41.582 --> 01:28:42.483
Fuck.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.788
Hey, Larry.

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:47.789
- Hey, Marty, man.

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:48.723
What are you doing in town?

01:28:48.723 --> 01:28:50.224
It's not even the holidays.

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:52.427
- Yeah, I'm surprising my
mom, but she's not home yet.

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:53.594
Do you know where she is?

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:54.529
- Well, let me see.

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:55.697
She was in this morning bitching

01:28:55.697 --> 01:28:57.131
about the Staverson
Senior Center.

01:28:57.131 --> 01:28:58.499
They're employing
unlicensed nurses.

01:28:58.499 --> 01:28:59.667
- Alright, Staverson.

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:00.902
Thanks, Larry.

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:01.803
Take care.

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:05.907
- Alice.

01:29:06.808 --> 01:29:08.242
Do you like the nurses?

01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:10.411
- What?

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:11.846
- The nurses, do
you like the nurses?

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:15.550
- Are the nurses
treating you alright?

01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:18.152
Do you like the nurses?

01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:20.455
- No, they yell too much.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:26.227
- Hi everybody, how's it going?

01:29:26.227 --> 01:29:29.297
Just wanted to know how the
staff is treating everyone.

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:30.765
- Hey, what do you expect?

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:33.735
These days, young
people are a disgrace.

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:37.105
- Now, Herb, there's nothing
wrong with kids these days.

01:29:39.073 --> 01:29:41.142
- I'm a little
concerned about him.

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:42.110
What's going on?

01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:43.344
- He's taking Percocet.

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:45.613
- I think they're
overmedicating him.

01:29:45.613 --> 01:29:46.514
I don't think this is good.

01:29:46.514 --> 01:29:47.415
- Mom.

01:29:48.282 --> 01:29:49.117
Mom.

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:50.151
- Oh my god.

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:51.185
Marty?

01:29:51.185 --> 01:29:52.653
Oh my god!

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:55.323
Everybody, this is my son
Marty, Marty from California!

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:56.257
- I need to talk to you.

01:29:56.257 --> 01:29:57.058
- What are you doing here?

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:58.526
- I need to talk to you.

01:29:58.526 --> 01:30:00.027
I need to talk to you
about your new boyfriend.

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:01.996
- What?

01:30:03.164 --> 01:30:05.133
Is everything okay?

01:30:05.133 --> 01:30:09.504
Marty, what's going on?

01:30:09.504 --> 01:30:11.439
What?

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:13.207
- I paid him.

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:14.976
I paid him to see you.

01:30:14.976 --> 01:30:15.810
- Excuse me?

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:16.878
- Your boyfriend, Rawl.

01:30:17.779 --> 01:30:19.614
He's an old buddy of mine.

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:20.948
He needed the cash, so...

01:30:22.283 --> 01:30:24.352
So I got him to romance you.

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:33.795
- So you're saying that
you paid Rawl to see me?

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:36.097
- All I knew was just that
you were suffocating me,

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:37.265
you know?

01:30:37.265 --> 01:30:39.300
I needed your
misery off my back!

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:49.277
- You ungrateful,
rotten, spoiled bastard.

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:51.779
- What's so ungrateful?

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:55.483
The best thing my son ever
gave me was a dishwasher.

01:30:55.483 --> 01:30:57.084
- Shut up!

01:30:57.084 --> 01:31:00.421
How dare you manipulate
my life like this?

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:02.023
- Benny, Benny, Benny, wake up.

01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:05.126
- They serving Jello?
-You want my misery
off of your back?

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:08.830
- No, this kid just sent
a whore to seduce his mom.

01:31:08.830 --> 01:31:10.998
- I have made so many
sacrifices for you.

01:31:10.998 --> 01:31:12.834
I have fed you, I
have clothed you,

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:15.436
I'm still paying off
your fucking education.

01:31:15.436 --> 01:31:18.039
How dare you manipulate
my life like this!

01:31:18.039 --> 01:31:19.607
- You punish me!

01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:21.375
You punish me for being born!

01:31:21.375 --> 01:31:22.743
- You are out of your mind!

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:23.611
- You just said it.

01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:24.745
Look what you said,

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:26.614
after all the sacrifices
you made for me.

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:27.882
- That's not what I meant.

01:31:27.882 --> 01:31:30.585
You're making me so
angry and confused!

01:31:30.585 --> 01:31:33.020
- But that's what
it feels like to me!

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:34.522
You understand?

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:36.390
I mean, maybe that's why you
blanket me with all your shit,

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:37.658
constantly complaining
about problems,

01:31:37.658 --> 01:31:39.660
problems I can't solve.

01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:41.662
I mean, whenever I have
moments of happiness,

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:42.864
it just turns into guilt

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:46.634
because I know you're
fucking miserable.

01:31:46.634 --> 01:31:49.270
- I am not trying to
sabotage your life.

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:52.273
Who am I supposed to
talk to if not my son?

01:31:52.273 --> 01:31:54.609
- But that's it, you
see, just you turn to me.

01:31:54.609 --> 01:31:56.444
You turn to me with
problems that I can't solve

01:31:56.444 --> 01:31:58.279
and you don't want solutions.

01:31:58.279 --> 01:31:59.747
- Of course I want solutions!

01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:01.249
- No, you don't!

01:32:01.249 --> 01:32:03.417
No, you don't, because at
some point in your life,

01:32:03.417 --> 01:32:06.387
you decided that life is
one big fucking problem.

01:32:06.387 --> 01:32:08.155
All my life, you
played the victim,

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:09.857
from blaming your dad
for not doing enough

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:13.961
to blaming my father, my
father for screwing you over.

01:32:15.162 --> 01:32:16.364
Right?

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:17.965
It's always the world
that shit on you.

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:21.269
I was just so sick
of sharing your pain.

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:24.305
So yeah, yeah, I sent you a
man, I sent you a good man,

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:26.173
a man of compassion just
to show you a little joy

01:32:26.173 --> 01:32:27.341
and what do you do?

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:29.176
You just kick him
right out of your life.

01:32:29.176 --> 01:32:30.945
What was it this time, right?

01:32:30.945 --> 01:32:32.513
Not pretty enough?

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:33.748
Too old?

01:32:33.748 --> 01:32:35.449
It's the government's fault?

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:38.219
We live in a sad, brutal
fucking world, right, Mom?

01:32:38.219 --> 01:32:41.956
- I don't have to
listen to this!

01:32:41.956 --> 01:32:44.025
- Well, I don't have
to live it anymore!

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:46.294
It's killing me!

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:49.697
You forget you have a son!

01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:52.033
You have a son!

01:32:58.205 --> 01:33:00.608
(calm music)

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:17.325
- Hey.

01:33:21.395 --> 01:33:22.630
- You're smiling.

01:33:22.630 --> 01:33:25.199
I can't believe you're
smiling, you're in jail.

01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:26.701
It's my fault.

01:33:26.701 --> 01:33:29.904
- Marty, I once spent three
weeks in a ditch in Damascus.

01:33:29.904 --> 01:33:32.640
By comparison, this place is
pretty much a boutique hotel.

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:34.075
- I selfishly used you.

01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:36.544
How can you be okay with that?

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:39.146
- I've transcended.

01:33:39.146 --> 01:33:41.215
- You've got cappuccino
in your cell?

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:42.650
(laughs)

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:45.620
- Marty, I've spent
the last nine years

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.889
as a traveling nomad,
seeking to find myself.

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:51.158
I can feel this.

01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:52.960
I've done everything,
everything you can imagine,

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:55.096
from Zen to acid.

01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:59.166
I thought I'd changed, but
I haven't, not really.

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:03.204
My needs weren't met.

01:34:03.204 --> 01:34:04.105
Until Judith.

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:07.008
- You need my mom?

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:07.942
- Yeah.

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:09.477
But not anymore.

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:10.478
It's thanks to your setup.

01:34:10.478 --> 01:34:11.646
You know, I felt safe in it

01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:13.948
because I knew the
connection wasn't real.

01:34:13.948 --> 01:34:15.750
I'd nothing to lose.

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:18.619
I could finally let my walls
down after all these years.

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:21.522
And then it became real.

01:34:21.522 --> 01:34:24.191
With me, not Judith, but...

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:27.662
Then I finally survived my
fear of what would happen

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:30.031
if I exposed myself and
then I was left alone.

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:32.299
- But I...

01:34:32.299 --> 01:34:33.701
I conned you, man--

01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:34.869
- Wait, buddy.

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:36.804
- You were hurt badly,
you flipped out,

01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:39.840
and you're in jail, and
you could have died.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.575
- I've never felt more alive!

01:34:41.575 --> 01:34:44.612
I don't fear love, I
don't fear losing it.

01:34:45.513 --> 01:34:46.514
I have courage now.

01:34:47.848 --> 01:34:50.284
Marty, all these years I
thought the key to happiness

01:34:50.284 --> 01:34:51.185
was freedom.

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.223
So I traveled, I left, I spent
years bumming around rootless.

01:34:58.159 --> 01:34:59.694
It felt good.

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:01.662
I felt good a lot of the
time, but real happiness,

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:05.299
Marty, real happiness
was eluding me till now.

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:09.370
Now I know the key to freedom.

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:12.139
It's courage.

01:35:13.841 --> 01:35:16.577
I have courage
now, thanks to you.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.816
- Jesus, man.

01:35:21.816 --> 01:35:23.050
If you were so
scared of intimacy,

01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:24.852
why didn't you
just use a condom?

01:35:24.852 --> 01:35:27.354
(laughs)

01:35:27.354 --> 01:35:28.355
- Oh.

01:35:28.355 --> 01:35:29.623
Time to go.

01:35:29.623 --> 01:35:30.357
I'm teaching yoga in
here at the moment.

01:35:30.357 --> 01:35:31.659
- It's great.
- Yoga?

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:33.728
- See ya, bye.

01:35:38.065 --> 01:35:39.567
- Hey, when do we
get to go to Peru?

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.569
They have this shaman there
that can read your future

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:43.904
by the rings around your anus.

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:45.439
- (laughs) That's good.

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:46.607
- Are you sure you
want to take that

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:47.608
to be your business partner?

01:35:47.608 --> 01:35:48.776
- You kidding me?

01:35:48.776 --> 01:35:50.611
He's got more drive than a tank.

01:35:50.611 --> 01:35:53.114
- Woohoo, world, here I come!

01:35:57.818 --> 01:35:59.053
(laughs)

01:35:59.053 --> 01:36:00.254
- Great, planetary
Herpes for all.

01:36:01.388 --> 01:36:03.591
- You ever traveled this
long by yourself before?

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:05.159
- No, never.

01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:08.496
But I'm taking a bus to LA,

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:09.897
I'm gonna get my
thoughts together,

01:36:09.897 --> 01:36:11.699
and I'm doing it, man.

01:36:14.835 --> 01:36:16.937
You know, I want to
thank you, Marty.

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:18.506
Being used never felt so good.

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:22.176
- You think maybe it's
getting laid after 10 years

01:36:22.176 --> 01:36:23.711
that felt good, you asshole?

01:36:25.012 --> 01:36:26.981
- You freed me in more
ways than you'll ever know.

01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:31.418
- Just stick to the decaf, okay?

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:36.791
- You're late!

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:39.493
- They were just all being
maintained, the subway system.

01:36:41.061 --> 01:36:44.064
Okay, I may have
left a little late.

01:36:44.064 --> 01:36:45.099
- How'd you know I'd be here?

01:36:45.099 --> 01:36:46.066
- I called her.

01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:50.104
- All I know is that you
made too much damn sense

01:36:50.104 --> 01:36:52.306
the other day for me
not to give you a hug.

01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:55.643
(kisses)

01:36:55.643 --> 01:36:56.544
- Mom.
- I love you honey.

01:36:57.678 --> 01:37:00.815
- I just want you to be happy.

01:37:00.815 --> 01:37:02.049
- I know.

01:37:02.049 --> 01:37:04.118
I'm so proud of the man
that you have become.

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:08.422
- Hey, you son of a bitch,
you got a bus to catch.

01:37:10.357 --> 01:37:11.225
- Alright.

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:16.630
- Don't forget to
send a postcard.

01:37:19.433 --> 01:37:20.801
- You know, I've
never written one.

01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:22.036
- It's easy.

01:37:22.036 --> 01:37:23.304
Just write about why
you are where you are.

01:37:23.304 --> 01:37:25.172
- And the hand you
held to get there.

01:37:31.879 --> 01:37:33.814
- [Marty] Midway
wants us to invest.

01:37:34.949 --> 01:37:37.017
Investing is taking
charge of your life.

01:37:38.352 --> 01:37:39.987
And I've learned if you don't
take charge of your life,

01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:41.155
somebody else will.

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:43.724
Could be your boss, your lover,

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:46.293
even your mother.

01:37:46.293 --> 01:37:49.330
We unknowingly take
responsibility for
everyone's happiness

01:37:49.330 --> 01:37:50.798
but our own.

01:37:50.798 --> 01:37:53.467
We're gonna show
challenging your assumptions

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:56.003
is the Midway.

01:37:57.972 --> 01:38:01.809
In a laboratory,
three blue-collared
monkeys sit in a cage

01:38:01.809 --> 01:38:03.344
with a staircase inside.

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:06.380
A scientist places a
banana on the top step.

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.816
The first monkey darts up
the steps to snatch it.

01:38:08.816 --> 01:38:10.317
Right before he can
grab the banana,

01:38:10.317 --> 01:38:12.486
a scientist stops him by
spraying all three monkeys

01:38:12.486 --> 01:38:14.088
with ice cold water.

01:38:14.088 --> 01:38:16.857
Now, the second monkey
takes his chances.

01:38:16.857 --> 01:38:18.092
He goes for the banana,

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:19.660
but the other monkeys,
they force him back,

01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:21.328
not wanting another ice bath.

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:24.531
Now the scientist lifts
monkey one out of the cage

01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:27.801
and replaces him with a new
chimp wearing a red collar.

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:30.471
He spots that yummy banana
and he heads up the steps,

01:38:30.471 --> 01:38:32.273
but the other two
monkeys grab his butt

01:38:32.273 --> 01:38:33.741
and refuse to let him go up.

01:38:33.741 --> 01:38:36.110
Now the science nerds
take out the second monkey

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:39.280
and put in a chimp also
strapped with a red collar.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.781
This poor little guy.

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:43.584
He heads to the steps, but
the other two beat him back.

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:46.854
Now those science guys take
out the original third monkey

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:49.957
and replace him with one
wearing another red collar.

01:38:49.957 --> 01:38:52.393
This newest chimp,
feeling like a bite,

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:54.395
he goes for the banana steps.

01:38:54.395 --> 01:38:55.896
But wouldn't you know
it, the other two,

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:57.698
they beat his ass down.

01:38:57.698 --> 01:38:59.900
This victimized little
chimp, he turns to the others

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.669
and says "What was
that all about?"

01:39:02.736 --> 01:39:04.438
The other monkey answers
"That's just the way

01:39:04.438 --> 01:39:06.173
life's always
been around here."

01:39:08.509 --> 01:39:09.343
Words appear.

01:39:09.343 --> 01:39:11.812
Monkey see, monkey do?

01:39:11.812 --> 01:39:12.980
Make your fate.

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:14.748
Just you.

01:39:15.916 --> 01:39:17.651
Midway Investments.

01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:19.353

01:39:34.368 --> 01:39:36.437

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:40.240

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:41.208
