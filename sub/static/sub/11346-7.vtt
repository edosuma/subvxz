ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.739 --> 00:08.309
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.342 --> 00:10.178
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.211 --> 00:11.612
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.645 --> 00:13.681
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.549
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.458
- [Russian accent]
ANGEL!

00:24.492 --> 00:26.394
STOP, ANGEL!

00:52.120 --> 00:52.886
- AAH!

00:52.920 --> 00:55.223
[shouting in Russian,
panicked]

00:55.256 --> 00:58.159
[screaming]

01:08.802 --> 01:11.572
- SO, YOU KNOW HOW,
IN THE SUMMERTIME,

01:11.605 --> 01:12.673
YOU'RE DRINKIN' OUTSIDE

01:12.706 --> 01:14.308

01:14.342 --> 01:15.576
- YEAH, SO YOU DON'T
GET A SUMMONS--YEAH.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.645
- YEAH, SO HOW 'BOUT THIS?
DESIGNER BEER BAGS.

01:17.678 --> 01:20.448
IN SUEDE, LEATHER, VELOUR--
ALL BLINGED OUT.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.350
THAT'S HOT, RIGHT?

01:22.383 --> 01:23.451
GONNA GET ME PAID FOR SURE.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.618
- YEAH, THEY ALREADY
HAVE THOSE.

01:24.652 --> 01:25.619
KOOZIES.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.355
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

01:31.325 --> 01:32.560
- OH, MAN.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.631
- SO LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT.

01:37.665 --> 01:40.368
NO PURSE, NO I.D.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.303
BUTTERFLY TATTOO.

01:42.336 --> 01:45.373
- THE BUS BOYS SAY THE BODY
WASN'T HERE AN HOUR AGO.

01:45.406 --> 01:49.510
NO ONE HEARD ANY SCREAMS.
NO ONE SAW ANYTHING.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.645
BUT SHE WAS RAPED?

01:51.679 --> 01:54.182
- BRUISING ON THE THIGHS.
BLOOD ON THE PANTIES.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.517
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.618
LET'S FLIP HER.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.852
ON THREE.

01:58.886 --> 02:02.523
ONE, TWO, THREE.

02:02.556 --> 02:03.557
[gasps]

02:03.591 --> 02:04.592
- DAMN IT.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.628
- DOC, IS THAT ACID?

02:07.661 --> 02:10.164
I MEAN, HER FACE IS GONE.

02:10.198 --> 02:13.934
- IT LOOKS MECHANICAL,
NOT CHEMICAL.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.238
[scoffs] PULLED HER TEETH,
ROOTS AND ALL.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.939
- NO FINGERTIPS, EITHER.

02:18.972 --> 02:23.511
THESE BUTCHERS
KNEW THEIR BUSINESS.

02:23.544 --> 02:27.215
- THERE'S ANOTHER TAT HERE.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.148
WHAT IS THAT?

02:28.182 --> 02:31.752
CYRILLIC?
EITHER ONE OF YOU READ RUSSIAN?

02:31.785 --> 02:34.522
- I WISH.
- NO DENTAL RECORDS.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.757
NO FINGERPRINTS.
NO FACE.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.692
BUT THEY LEAVE THE TATTOOS.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.862
- WELL, THEY DIDN'T WANT US
TO KNOW WHO SHE WAS.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.898
BUT THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE
SOMEBODY GOT THE MESSAGE.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.252
- WHAT DO WE GOT?

03:38.286 --> 03:39.920
- OUR JANE DOE
IS FEMALE, WHITE.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.923
LATE 20s TO EARLY 30s.
RAPED AND MURDERED.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.959
- WE CANVASSED THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
NO ONE SAW OR HEARD A THING.

03:45.993 --> 03:48.562
- IT'S LIKE THE BODY
MATERIALIZED OUT OF THIN AIR.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.931
- WELL, THEY DID
SOME NUMBER ON HER.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.032
WHAT ABOUT THESE TATTOOS?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.535
- I HAD A BUDDY IN THE GANG UNIT
TAKE A LOOK AT THEM.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.503
THE BUTTERFLY IS GENERIC.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.438
COULD HAVE BEEN INKED
BY ANYONE, ANYWHERE.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.940
BUT THIS ONE'S SPECIFIC
TO THE RUSSIAN MAFIA.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.809
MOST LIKELY DONE
IN THE MOTHERLAND.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.411
- IT'S THE MARK
OF A PROSTITUTE.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.812
- WHAT DO THOSE WORDS MEAN?

04:04.845 --> 04:06.547
- "MOTHER, FORGIVE ME."

04:06.580 --> 04:08.816
- GETTIN' AN IDEA
OF WHO WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.051
- THE PRELIM AUTOPSY REPORT
JUST CAME IN.

04:11.084 --> 04:15.356
SAND WAS FOUND IN THE RECTUM
AND VAGINAL CANAL OF THE VICTIM.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.758
THERE WERE ALSO CUTS
FROM BITS OF GLASS AND DEBRIS.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.026
- M.E. FIX THE TIME OF DEATH?

04:19.059 --> 04:21.895
- UM, YEAH, EIGHT TO TEN HOURS
BEFORE DISCOVERY.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.365
- SO SHE WAS MURDERED
ON A BEACH,

04:24.398 --> 04:25.833
AND THEN DUMPED
AT THE RESTAURANT.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.701
IT'S USUALLY
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.370
- THEY WANTED THE BODY FOUND.

04:29.403 --> 04:30.971
- HOLD ON, DIDN'T THE M.E.'S
OFFICE COLLECT SAND SAMPLES

04:31.004 --> 04:32.940
AFTER THE GILGO BEACH
MURDERS?

04:32.973 --> 04:34.475
- YEAH, THEY WANTED TO SEE
IF ANY OF THE VICTIMS

04:34.508 --> 04:35.943
HAD BEEN MOVED
FROM OTHER SITES.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.411
- ALL RIGHT,
WE GOT LUCKY HERE.

04:37.445 --> 04:39.380
THE SAND WAS MADE UP
OF FINE PARTICLE

04:39.413 --> 04:40.948
AND WHITE MASON...

04:40.981 --> 04:43.351
INDICATING THAT IT'S
FROM A REPAIRED BEACH,

04:43.384 --> 04:45.486
MEANING THAT THE CITY
SPREAD THE SAND.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.421
SO THERE'S ONLY THREE REPAIRED
BEACHES IN THE AREA.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.989
ROCKAWAY, BRIGHTON,
OR CONEY ISLAND.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.525
- WELL, BRIGHTON BEACH IS STILL
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY RUSSIAN.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.594
THEY CALL IT
THE ODESSA BY THE SEA.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.429
- SO IT'S A GOOD PLACE
TO START.

04:55.463 --> 04:56.964
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
IF THIS IS RUSSIAN MOB,

04:56.997 --> 04:58.832
THIS ONE'S GONNA
SCARE PEOPLE OFF.

04:58.866 --> 05:01.435
SO START WITH THE BUTTERFLY.

05:01.469 --> 05:05.873
MAYBE WE CAN FIND OUT
WHO THIS POOR WOMAN WAS.

05:27.595 --> 05:28.829
- NO?

05:28.862 --> 05:30.831
THANK YOU.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.566
- A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE
ARE ILLEGAL.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.968
THE LAST THING THEY WANNA DO
IS TALK TO THE COPS.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.837
GIRL DISAPPEARS,
IT'S NOT THEIR PROBLEM.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.740
- ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY DON'T
KNOW WHO WANTED HER GONE.

05:39.773 --> 05:41.141
- GOOD THING IS,

05:41.174 --> 05:42.576
WITNESSES ARE LIKE CHILDREN--

05:42.610 --> 05:44.712
THEY RESPOND
TO BRIBES AND THREATS.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.814
- [chuckling]
AND THEY'RE EASY TO TRICK.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.352
- I'LL LOOK
FOR THE MANAGER.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.831
- [speaking Russian]

06:21.214 --> 06:22.182

06:22.215 --> 06:23.417
SHUSH! HUH?

06:23.451 --> 06:24.452
- EXCUSE ME, MISS.

06:24.485 --> 06:25.719
MISS.
- [speaking Russian]

06:25.753 --> 06:27.821
- DETECTIVE TUTUOLA, SVU.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.990
I'M TRYING TO I.D. SOMEBODY
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.926
DO ANY OF YOUR CUSTOMERS
HAVE THIS TATTOO?

06:32.960 --> 06:35.195
- NO. DON'T KNOW.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.964
- NO?

06:36.997 --> 06:38.098
HOW 'BOUT THIS GIRL?

06:40.133 --> 06:41.835
WELL, YOU MUST KNOW HER.
YOU HAVE HER UP ON YOUR WALL.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.071
- UH, NO ENGLISH.
SORRY.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.139
- SHE DOESN'T SPEAK ENGLISH.
CALL I.N.S.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.975
THEY'LL SEND
SOME TRANSLATORS DOWN HERE.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.076
- ON IT. WE'LL HAVE
TO SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN

06:49.109 --> 06:50.678
TILL THEY GET HERE.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.980
- NO, WAIT.
WE HAVE A BIG PARTY COMING IN.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.448
- NOW SHE SPEAKS ENGLISH.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.983
- LAST CHANCE.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.718
WHO'S THE GIRL?

06:57.751 --> 06:59.152
WHO'S SHE WITH?

06:59.186 --> 07:00.721
- OKAY.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.490
THAT IS LENA,
AND THE MAN IS DANIEL.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.592
THEY HAD THEIR ENGAGEMENT PARTY
HERE LAST FRIDAY.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.127
I GO NOW?
- ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.531
THEY PAY WITH A CREDIT CARD?

07:12.165 --> 07:14.635
- HEY.
YOU GET THE I.D.?

07:14.668 --> 07:16.737
- OH, JUST THE FIRST NAME

07:16.770 --> 07:18.071
- THAT'S LENA.

07:18.105 --> 07:21.509
SHE HAD A FIANCE,
DANIEL CARTER.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.577

07:23.611 --> 07:26.680
RUNS A NONPROFIT,
NYC HABITATION.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.115
LIVES IN KIPS BAY.

07:28.148 --> 07:29.850
FIN AND ROLLINS
ARE ON THEIR WAY THERE.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.119
- ANY CONNECTION
TO THE RUSSIAN MOB?

07:32.152 --> 07:33.153
- NOT ON PAPER.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.556
THERE'S NO RECORD.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.825
NOW, I KNOW YOU'RE
NOT A ROMANTIC,

07:37.858 --> 07:40.694
BUT...THEY JUST
GOT ENGAGED.

07:40.728 --> 07:41.962
- LOOK, YOU KNOW THE STATS.

07:41.995 --> 07:42.830
WHEN A WOMAN IS MURDERED--

07:42.863 --> 07:45.666
- YOU START WITH
THE MAN IN HER LIFE.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.868
SEE...THAT'S WHY
I'M A FIRM BELIEVER

07:47.901 --> 07:51.171
IN DIVORCE.

07:51.204 --> 07:54.007
WHEN YOU FEEL
THAT...THING BUILDING,

07:54.041 --> 07:57.745
YOU JUST GOTTA
GET THE HELL OUT.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.246
- YOUR PARENTS SPLIT.

07:59.279 --> 08:02.616
- YEAH.

08:02.650 --> 08:04.785
YEAH, MY POP,
HE, UH...

08:04.818 --> 08:08.255
LIKED TO BOUNCE MY MOM

08:08.288 --> 08:10.591
THE DAY HE LEFT,

08:10.624 --> 08:12.926
WE HAD A PARTY.

08:12.960 --> 08:17.230
IT WAS ONE OF THE HAPPIEST
MOMENTS OF MY LIFE.

08:17.264 --> 08:20.133
- YOU EVER TALK TO HIM?

08:20.167 --> 08:23.136
- LAST I HEARD,
HE GOT INTO SOME TROUBLE.

08:23.170 --> 08:27.007
WENT BACK DOWN TO MIAMI.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.942
[speaking foreign language]

08:33.647 --> 08:35.015
THIS T.M.I.?

08:35.048 --> 08:37.250
- NO.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.619
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR FATHER?

08:38.652 --> 08:40.554
- UH...

08:40.588 --> 08:43.290
UH, THAT'S A LONG STORY.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.730
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.264
THEY WORKED HER OVER.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.667
ASIDE FROM THE HEAD WOUND
THAT CAUSED HER DEATH,

08:53.701 --> 08:56.570
SHE WAS RAPED VAGINALLY
AND ANALLY.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.338
- HOW'D THEY DO THAT
TO HER FACE?

08:58.371 --> 09:00.107
- POWER TOOLS.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.143
SANDED OFF HER FACE,
SAWED OFF HER FINGERTIPS.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.345
SHE WAS DEAD BEFORE
THE WORST OF IT.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.881
- SMALL FAVORS.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.017
THANKS, MELINDA.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.586
WHAT DID YOU SAY
THAT HE DID AGAIN?

09:12.620 --> 09:16.323
- HE RUNS A NONPROFIT.
BUILDS HOUSES FOR THE HOMELESS.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.759
- THAT WOULD GIVE HIM
ACCESS TO POWER TOOLS.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.163
- MR. CARTER WORKS FROM HOME.
HE SHOULD BE HERE.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.164
SOMETHING WRONG?

09:24.197 --> 09:25.198
- HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW HIM?

09:25.232 --> 09:26.266
- WE PLAY CHESS TOGETHER.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.635
ONE MOVE EVERY DAY.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.774
YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.910

10:14.347 --> 10:15.315
SO IS THIS LENA?

10:15.348 --> 10:16.416

10:16.449 --> 10:18.051
- YOU GOT A LAST NAME
ON HER?

10:18.085 --> 10:19.152
- SOMETHING RUSSIAN.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.888
- HMM.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.356
THE MAN WAS, UH,
DEFINITELY SMITTEN.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.959
- OLDER MAN, YOUNGER WOMAN.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.260
DANIEL THE JEALOUS TYPE?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.696
- NO.

10:28.729 --> 10:29.730
YOU THINK HE HURT HER?

10:29.763 --> 10:31.031
NO WAY.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.733
LENA IS HIS SUNSHINE.

10:32.766 --> 10:33.901
DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN TO HER?

10:33.934 --> 10:35.168
- WE NEED YOU
TO CALL DANIEL.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.303
ON HIS CELL PHONE.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.038
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

10:38.071 --> 10:40.040
- WE THINK DANIEL MIGHT BE
IN A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.675
WE THINK HE MIGHT BE
RUNNING SCARED.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.976
BUT HE'LL
TALK TO YOU, RIGHT?

10:43.010 --> 10:45.045
- MM-HMM.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.047
FIND OUT WHERE HE IS.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.782

10:48.816 --> 10:51.852
- PUT IT ON SPEAKER.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.386
[line ringing]

10:53.420 --> 10:54.788
- [on phone] HELLO?
HELLO?

10:54.822 --> 10:56.790
- YO, MR. CARTER.
WHERE ARE YOU?

10:56.824 --> 10:58.191
- LUIS? WHY--
WHY ARE YOU--

10:58.225 --> 10:59.793
IS LENA THERE?

10:59.827 --> 11:00.894
- UH...

11:00.928 --> 11:02.996
- [whispering] TELL HIM
YOU HAVE A PACKAGE FOR HIM.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.798
- UH, I GOT A PACKAGE
FOR YOU, BOSS.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.099
UH, UPS WON'T LET ME SIGN.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.034
CAN YOU POP HOME QUICK?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.903
- PACKAGE, WHAT--
WHAT KIND OF PACKAGE?

11:09.937 --> 11:12.039
- THEY WON'T SAY.
YOU GOTTA COME HOME.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.841
- AH, I CAN'T--
I CAN'T LEAVE WHERE I AM.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.243
- YOU OKAY, MAN?
TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.377
MR. CARTER...

11:17.410 --> 11:18.812
- NO, I CAN'T.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:18.846 --> 11:20.080
MR. CARTER!
[click]

11:20.113 --> 11:21.348
[snaps phone shut]

11:21.381 --> 11:22.382
HE SOUNDS SCARED.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.351
- THAT MUSIC?
A KIDS' PARTY?

11:24.384 --> 11:26.319
- I'LL HAVE TARU
TRACE THAT NUMBER.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.788
I NEED TO BORROW YOUR PHONE.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.222
THANK YOU.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.991
THERE'S NO GPS
IN THIS PHONE.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.426
THEY TRIANGULATED THE SIGNAL.
IT'S TOO WIDE AN AREA.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.763
- IF HE'S EVEN STILL HERE.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.932
- ROLLINS SAID THEY HEARD
KIDS ON THE PHONE

11:38.966 --> 11:41.268
AND MUSIC.

11:41.301 --> 11:44.137
THERE'S A CAROUSEL
RIGHT AT THE END OF THE PIER.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.906
WE FOUND A BODY THERE
LAST FALL.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.340
- ALL UNITS CONVERGE.

11:47.374 --> 11:50.177
CHELSEA PIERS PARK,
CAROUSEL AREA.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.246
[calliope plays]

11:53.280 --> 11:58.151
*

11:58.185 --> 11:59.853
I'VE GOT HIM.
12:00.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.188
WE'RE MOVING IN.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.422
- COME ON!

12:02.455 --> 12:05.793
- DANIEL CARTER.
NYPD.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.394
- GO AWAY. GO AWAY.
I DIDN'T CALL YOU.

12:09.429 --> 12:10.163
DANIEL, WHO WILL THEY KILL?
LENA?

12:11.431 --> 12:14.467
- YES!
YOU HAVE TO GO AWAY.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.738
WHERE IS SHE?

12:22.575 --> 12:24.411
IS SHE DEAD?

12:29.349 --> 12:31.418
[crying] THEY SAID
THEY'D BRING HER HERE!

12:31.451 --> 12:32.419
- WHO, DANIEL?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.788
- THAT WAS THE DEAL!
I PAID!

12:34.822 --> 12:37.124
I--I PAID.

12:37.157 --> 12:41.962
[sobbing]
I PAID, I PAID, I PAID.

12:41.995 --> 12:45.365
I PAID!

12:50.437 --> 12:51.872
- THIS WAY, MR. CARTER.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.141
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?
- THANK YOU.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.277
- DETECTIVE.
- COUNSELOR.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.212
- LOOK, DANIEL'S A FRIEND.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.114
I'VE ADVISED HIM
TO COOPERATE FULLY,

13:01.148 --> 13:04.251
BUT CAN I ASK YOU
TO GO EASY ON HIM?

13:04.284 --> 13:07.855
- WE'RE INVESTIGATING A MURDER.
- I KNOW, I UNDERSTAND.

13:07.888 --> 13:11.024
BUT HE LOST HIS WIFE
THREE YEARS AGO--CANCER.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.893
LENA BROUGHT HIM
BACK TO LIFE.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.127
HE WASN'T PREPARED
FOR THIS.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.395
- ARE YOU A CRIMINAL ATTORNEY?

13:15.428 --> 13:17.230
- TAX LAW, PRIMARILY.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.031
SOME ESTATE PLANNING.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.500
- THEN, COUNSELOR,
I WOULD SUGGEST

13:20.533 --> 13:21.869
YOU GO IN...

13:21.902 --> 13:23.971
AND TELL YOUR CLIENT
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.240
- DO YOU RECOGNIZE THESE?

13:27.274 --> 13:29.576
- [sighs]

13:29.609 --> 13:31.544
THIS ONE'S
ON LENA'S HIP.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.982
THE BUTTERFLY'S
ON HER SHOULDER BLADE.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.150
WHY CAN'T I JUST I.D.
THE BODY?

13:37.184 --> 13:38.185
- LATER.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.320
HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?

13:40.353 --> 13:42.990
- JUST TELL THEM
EVERYTHING, DANNY.

13:43.023 --> 13:46.493
- AH, IT'S GONNA
SOUND CHEAP.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.561
WELL, IT IS CHEAP.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.264
WE MET ON A RUSSIAN BRIDE
WEB SITE.

13:51.298 --> 13:54.001
YOURCZARINA.COM.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.904
- WE'VE SEEN SOME SCAMS
RUN THROUGH THOSE SITES.

13:56.937 --> 13:58.571
- THIS WASN'T LIKE THAT.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.408
MY BUDDY TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.010
HE USED TO GO TO RUSSIA
ON BUSINESS,

14:03.043 --> 14:04.878
MEET EIGHT TO TEN GIRLS
FROM THE SITE,

14:04.912 --> 14:06.880
SLEEP WITH THEM ALL
AND MARRY NONE.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.516
HE WAS DIVORCED.
IT WAS LIKE A SEX TRIP FOR HIM.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.884
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

14:10.918 --> 14:13.253
- DETECTIVES...
IT WAS HIS FIANCEE.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.488
- I WAS GOING THROUGH
A LONELY TIME.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.024
I STARTED TROLLING.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.258
NOTHING SERIOUS.

14:18.291 --> 14:19.326
AND THEN I SAW
LENA'S PROFILE,

14:19.359 --> 14:21.561
AND THERE WAS JUST
SOMETHING ABOUT HER RIGHT AWAY.

14:21.594 --> 14:25.398
- SO YOU TWO SKYPED OR...

14:25.432 --> 14:26.333
- SKYPING WASN'T ALLOWED.

14:26.366 --> 14:30.170
WE CHATTED ONLINE
A FEW TIMES, I.M.ing.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.340
I HAD TO FLY TO MOSCOW
TO MEET HER.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.075
SHE--SHE TOOK ME
EVERYWHERE.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.078
EVEN ST. PETERSBURG...

14:38.111 --> 14:42.049
WHERE MY FAMILY
WAS ORIGINALLY FROM.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.984
WE TALKED AND TALKED.

14:44.017 --> 14:46.153
SHE WANTED TO KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.356
- AND THIS WAS ALL PLATONIC?

14:49.389 --> 14:50.557
- WELL, NO.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.692
BUT IT ISN'T WHAT YOU THINK.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.962
WE HAD A REAL
SOUL CONNECTION.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.430
- DID IT GO BOTH WAYS?

14:57.464 --> 15:00.667
DID SHE INTRODUCE YOU TO HER--
HER FRIENDS, HER FAMILY?

15:00.700 --> 15:02.135
- NO, SHE WAS CAREFUL.

15:02.169 --> 15:05.238
SHE HAD BEEN IN
AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP, HER--

15:05.272 --> 15:06.239
SHE WAS SCARED OF HER EX.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.408
HE WAS STALKING HER.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.443
- THAT WHAT SHE TOLD YOU?

15:10.477 --> 15:12.145
- WELL, I SAW HIM.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.114
HE WAS FOLLOWING US.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.483
ONE NIGHT, HE MADE A BIG SCENE
OUTSIDE THE HOTEL

15:16.516 --> 15:18.051
ABOUT HOW HE WANTED
HER BACK.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.053
I WOULD SEE HOW TERRIFIED
SHE WAS.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.391
- AND THAT'S WHEN
YOU CONVINCED HER TO MOVE

15:24.424 --> 15:27.427
TO NEW YORK CITY?

15:27.460 --> 15:29.196
- YEAH.

15:29.229 --> 15:32.299
IT WAS LIKE A FAIRY TALE.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.935
I WAS--I WAS GETTING
A SECOND CHANCE.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.139
AND HOW LONG DID YOU
LIVE TOGETHER

15:39.172 --> 15:41.174
BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED?

15:41.208 --> 15:44.511
- TWO MONTHS.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.146
THE NIGHT AFTER
THE ENGAGEMENT PARTY,

15:46.179 --> 15:49.549
I GOT A CALL THE KIDNAPPERS
WANTED $100,000.

15:49.582 --> 15:52.019
ALL I HAD WAS $80,000.
IT WAS MY LIFE SAVINGS.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.420
BUT I NEVER HESITATED.

15:53.453 --> 15:56.256
- AND YOU DIDN'T
NOTIFY THE POLICE?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.424
- THEY TOLD HIM
NOT TO CALL ANYONE.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.692
THEY SAID
THEY WERE GONNA KILL HER.

15:59.726 --> 16:01.294
- NOW, WHERE'D YOU
DROP THE MONEY?

16:01.328 --> 16:02.562
- A GARBAGE CAN.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.631
BRIGHTON BEACH.

16:04.664 --> 16:09.736
THEN THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO BRING LENA TO THE CAROUSEL.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.039
I GAVE THEM
EVERYTHING I HAD,

16:12.072 --> 16:14.074
AND THEY STILL KILLED HER.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.378
- LOOK, UH--
YOUR CELL PHONE.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.048
YOU HAVE ANY OTHER PHOTOS
OF YOUR RUSSIAN TRIP ON THERE?

16:21.081 --> 16:22.749
- UH...

16:22.782 --> 16:24.417
UH, HUNDREDS.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.653
AND VIDEO.

16:26.686 --> 16:30.190
I-I DIDN'T TAKE ANY PICTURES
OF HER EX.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.258
HE WAS STALKING US.

16:31.291 --> 16:35.762
- SO JUST FOCUS ON
THE PEOPLE IN THE BACKGROUND.

16:35.795 --> 16:39.099
- UH...NO, NO. NO.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.100
[on video] HI, SWEETIE.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.434
- HI.
- BABY DOLL.

16:41.468 --> 16:42.535
WAKE UP.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.703
WAKE UP.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.706
I'VE GOT SOME COFFEE FOR YOU.

16:46.739 --> 16:48.441

16:48.475 --> 16:49.642
COME BACK TO BED.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.010
- NEXT.

16:55.615 --> 17:00.653
- LOOK AT THE CROWD, DANIEL,
NOT YOUR GIRL.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.455
- RIGHT THERE.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.425
EVERYONE ELSE IS LOOKING
AT THE MUSICIANS.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.561
THAT GUY IS
TAKING PICTURES OF YOU.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.130
WAIT, I'LL ZOOM IN.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.502
- THAT'S HER EX.
I'D KNOW THAT FACE ANYWHERE.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.337
- GOOD.
GOOD, DANIEL.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.439
GIVE US A SECOND.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.774
- YOU'RE SURE
THAT'S THE GUY, RIGHT?

17:21.808 --> 17:25.278
- LET'S GET THIS TO REAL TIME'S
FACIAL RECOGNITION DATABASE.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.180
N.C.I.C., INTERPOL TOO.

17:27.214 --> 17:30.250
- HEY, SO I GOT SOMETHING
ON YOURCZARINA.COM.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.684
- YOU FIND OUT WHO OWNS IT?

17:31.718 --> 17:32.652
BET THEIR HANDS
AREN'T CLEAN.

17:32.685 --> 17:35.588
- WELL, THEY ARE HOSTED
BY A ROGUE PROVIDER.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.157
THEY'VE GOT AN OFFICE
HERE IN MANHATTAN.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.525
THEY CLAIM TO DO
INTERNET SECURITY.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.160
IT'S CALLED QUICK-SECURE.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.294
- WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

17:48.801 --> 17:50.437
- OHH-KAY.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.539
WELL, I HAVE
NOTHING ON FILE

17:52.572 --> 17:54.107
FOR YOURCZARINA.COM
OTHER THAN THAT

17:54.141 --> 17:56.143
SOMEONE WIRED IN SOME MONEY
FROM OFFSHORE.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.277
THAT'S ALL I GOT.

17:57.310 --> 17:58.578
- OKAY, THEN GIVE US
THE I.P. ADDRESS

17:58.611 --> 18:00.447
AND THE WIRE INFO,
AND WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.681
- UH, I CAN'T DO THAT

18:01.714 --> 18:04.317
BECAUSE OUR CLIENTS
PAY US TOP DOLLAR

18:04.351 --> 18:05.785
TO MAINTAIN THEIR PRIVACY.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.287
SO IF YOU WANT

18:07.320 --> 18:09.156
YOU GOTTA COME BACK IN

18:14.727 --> 18:16.663
FIRST, SPIT

18:18.731 --> 18:20.367
YOU'RE NOT A FIVE-YEAR-OLD.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.869
- YOU MAKE US GET A WARRANT,
WE'RE GONNA CALL THE FEDS.

18:22.902 --> 18:25.538
- UH, WELL, WE'RE NOT
DOING ANYTHING ILLEGAL HERE.

18:25.572 --> 18:28.708

18:30.610 --> 18:33.713

18:35.615 --> 18:37.184
AND PUT YOUR LITTLE ASS

18:48.528 --> 18:49.496
IS THAT COOL?

18:49.529 --> 18:50.597
- WE DON'T LIKE THEM ANYWAY.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.332
- GREAT, SO WE'RE
ON THE SAME PAGE.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.733
UM, THIS IS
THE PHYSICAL ADDRESS.

18:53.766 --> 18:56.469
UH, THE LAST PLACE
THAT THE WEBSITE

18:56.503 --> 18:58.705
WAS LOGGED INTO
AND CHANGED.

18:58.738 --> 19:03.243
- OKAY. SO THAT'S THE BEST
THAT I CAN DO FOR YOU.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.644
OKAY?
SO ARE WE COOL NOW?

19:13.486 --> 19:17.490
- YEAH.
- AIN'T LIFE A BITCH?

19:17.524 --> 19:19.326
- YOU NEVER HEARD

19:19.359 --> 19:21.228
THEN WHY IS THEIR WEB SITE
BEING RUN

19:21.261 --> 19:22.495
OFF ONE OF YOUR COMPUTERS?

19:22.529 --> 19:23.863
- THIS IS A TRAVEL AGENCY.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.232
I GIVE YOU FLIGHT, HOTEL.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.234
YOU HAVE TO FIND
THE BRIDE YOURSELF.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.202
LOOK, CHECK MY COMPUTER.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.470
MY RECORDS,
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.605
WE RUN
A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS HERE.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.607
- YOU GIVE US PERMISSION

19:34.641 --> 19:37.810
- YES! YES, IF YOU NEED TO.
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.479

19:46.953 --> 19:48.488
[grunting]

19:48.521 --> 19:49.789
- WHAT YOU
RUNNING FROM, MAN?

19:49.822 --> 19:51.791
- [grunting and panting]

20:04.036 --> 20:06.339
- TRAVEL AGENT.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.642
THAT'S A GOOD COVER
FOR THE YOURCZARINA WEBMASTER.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.479
- I-I JUST BOOK FLIGHTS.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.014
- WELL, ONE OF THE GIRLS
YOU FLEW IN GOT MURDERED.

20:15.047 --> 20:19.786
SO IF YOU JUST BOOK FLIGHTS,
TELL US WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.489
- YOU KNOW WHO THIS MAN IS?

20:22.522 --> 20:26.493
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH, DO YOU?

20:26.526 --> 20:28.027
- NO. WHY DON'T YOU TELL US?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.563
- WELL, YOU ALREADY
KNOW HE'S A KILLER.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.600
BUT THIS ONE,
HE LIVES BY THE CODE.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.902
- THE CODE?

20:35.935 --> 20:38.405
- HE'S VOR Y ZAKONE.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.639
HE'S RUSSIAN MAFIA.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.475
IF I TALK,
HE'LL KILL MY FAMILY,

20:42.509 --> 20:44.611
MY FRIENDS, MY DOG,

20:44.644 --> 20:46.379
AS SURE
AS WE'RE SITTING HERE.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.715
- YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR PROBLEM IS?

20:48.748 --> 20:50.617
YOU'RE SCARED
OF THE WRONG PEOPLE.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.852
- LET'S RELEASE HIM.

20:52.885 --> 20:53.753
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.655
- YOU SEE, EVERYBODY
IN BRIGHTON BEACH

20:55.688 --> 20:57.690
SAW YOU GETTING PICKED UP
AND TALKING TO THE COPS.

20:57.724 --> 20:58.991
SO WE'RE GONNA
DROP YOU OFF

20:59.025 --> 21:00.627
RIGHT BACK
ON THAT SAME BOARDWALK.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.496
- YEAH, AND EVERYBODY'S
GONNA KNOW YOU COOPERATED.

21:03.530 --> 21:06.466
- SO I'M SCREWED,
NO MATTER WHAT!

21:06.499 --> 21:09.436
- YOU HELP US,
WE HELP YOU.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.539
I'M THINKING
THAT'S THE BEST YOU GOT.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.710
WE GOT A NAME.

21:17.744 --> 21:19.078
LIEV BODROV.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.447
"THE BUTCHER."

21:20.480 --> 21:22.549
HE'S WANTED ON MULTIPLE
CHARGES OF MURDER,

21:22.582 --> 21:24.617
PROSTITUTION,
AND RACKETEERING.

21:24.651 --> 21:27.053
HE DID TEN YEARS
IN VORKUTA GULAG

21:27.086 --> 21:28.855
IN SIBERIA IN THE '90S.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.857
HE ESCAPED.
THEY HAVEN'T CAUGHT HIM SINCE.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.359
- WELL, I GOT SOMETHING TOO.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.393
WE HEARD BACK FROM INTERPOL.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.528
FOUR OTHER MURDERS
FIT OUR M.O.

21:35.562 --> 21:38.565
MOSCOW, JOHANNESBURG,
VANCOUVER, AND MUNICH.

21:38.598 --> 21:39.866
- SO THE BUTCHER IS RUNNING

21:39.899 --> 21:42.702
AN INTERNATIONAL
PROSTITUTION KIDNAPPING RING?

21:42.735 --> 21:43.836
THAT'S JUST GREAT.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.672
- AND EACH CASE,

21:45.705 --> 21:48.875
OUR VIC WAS FOUND
WITH NO FACE,

21:48.908 --> 21:50.042
THE TEETH REMOVED,

21:50.076 --> 21:51.911
AND HER FINGERTIPS CUT OFF.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.446
NO WAY FOR US TO TRACE.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.714
- EXCEPT...

21:54.747 --> 21:58.685
THEY ALL HAD THE "MOTHER,
FORGIVE ME" TATTOO.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.721
- HE'S BRANDING THEM
SO THE MARK KNOWS

22:01.754 --> 22:03.990
HIS CZARINA IS DEAD.

22:26.513 --> 22:28.648
- THANKS FOR MEETING ME HERE.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.750
- SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO SAY IN FRONT OF MY PARTNER?

22:30.783 --> 22:32.952
- I COULDN'T RISK
COMING TO THE PRECINCT.

22:32.985 --> 22:34.020
- WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:34.053 --> 22:36.389
- I DID MY OWN SEARCH
ONLINE.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.858
AND I FOUND THIS.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.793
DIFFERENT NAME, IRENE.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.429
DIFFERENT HAIRCUT.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.830
DIFFERENT COLOR.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.031
BUT THAT'S LENA.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.899
I'D KNOW HERE ANYWHERE.
SHE'S ALIVE.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.134
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.169
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN
THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.171
- IT WAS TAKEN
AFTER SHE WAS KIDNAPPED.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.540
THAT NECKLACE,
I GAVE IT TO LENA

22:53.573 --> 22:54.641
AT OUR ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.443
SHE DISAPPEARED
THE NEXT MORNING.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.177
I LOVED HER.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.779
I GRIEVED FOR HER.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.981
SHE WAS PLAYING ME
THE WHOLE TIME.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.851
I MEAN, THOSE PEOPLE FAKED
EVERYTHING.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.953
- WE HAVE A BODY IN OUR MORGUE.
THEY DIDN'T FAKE THAT.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.493
DANIEL...I NEED YOU
TO SHOW ME HOW

23:13.526 --> 23:17.530
TO SET UP A DATE
ON A WEB SITE LIKE THIS.

23:17.564 --> 23:19.766
- DETECTIVES,
WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?

23:19.799 --> 23:21.167
- WE WANT TO WIRE UP
AN UNDERCOVER,

23:21.200 --> 23:23.169
SEND HIM OUT ON A DATE
WITH LENA,

23:23.202 --> 23:24.871
A.K.A. IRENE.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.172
- OUR U.C.
NEEDS TO BE HER TYPE.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.541
LONELY, MATURE, WITH MONEY.

23:28.575 --> 23:30.176
- ARE YOU SURE YOU NEED
THE WIRE?

23:30.209 --> 23:32.078
A SUSPECT CAN SAY SOMETHING
EXCULPATORY.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.780
I HAVE SEEN IT BACKFIRE.

23:33.813 --> 23:35.448
- THESE ARE DANGEROUS PEOPLE,
COUNSELOR.

23:35.482 --> 23:37.216
IF OUR U.C.
GETS LURED SOMEWHERE,

23:37.249 --> 23:38.818
WE NEED TO BE ABLE
TO PROTECT HIM.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.219
- HOW QUICKLY
DO YOU NEED THE WARRANT?

23:40.252 --> 23:42.088
- YESTERDAY--
THESE ARE CAREER CRIMINALS

23:42.121 --> 23:43.923
WITH A GLOBAL NETWORK.

23:43.956 --> 23:45.892
- OKAY, I'LL SEE IF ANY
OF THE D.A.'S INVESTIGATORS

23:45.925 --> 23:47.159
FIT YOUR PROFILE.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.228
- WELL, ACTUALLY, UH...

23:49.261 --> 23:50.697
WE GOT IT COVERED.

23:50.730 --> 23:53.800
I'M GONNA TAKE IT.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.535
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU WERE UNDERCOVER?

23:55.568 --> 23:59.038
- PROBABLY BEFORE
EITHER OF YOU WERE BORN.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.139
- REMEMBER, CAPTAIN,

24:00.172 --> 24:01.708
NO MATTER HOW TEMPTING
IT MIGHT BE,

24:01.741 --> 24:03.876
YOU CANNOT GET INTIMATE
WITH THE SUSPECT.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.845
IT WILL UNDERMINE
YOUR CREDIBILITY AT TRIAL.

24:05.878 --> 24:08.515
- I'LL TRY TO CONTROL MYSELF,
COUNSELOR.

24:13.185 --> 24:16.523
- CAPTAIN, TARU SET UP
A LAPTOP IN YOUR OFFICE

24:16.556 --> 24:19.125
SO YOU CAN I.M. LENA
AND IT WON'T TRACE BACK HERE.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.527
YOU WANT US TO COME
IN THERE WITH YOU?

24:20.560 --> 24:21.794
- NOT A CHANCE.

24:21.828 --> 24:22.962
- NOW, I DID A LOT
OF UNDERCOVER WORK

24:22.995 --> 24:23.996
IN NARCOTICS.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.264
I KNOW FINN DID TOO.
THE KEY IS--

24:25.297 --> 24:26.866
- IS TO CHOOSE AN IDENTITY

24:26.899 --> 24:28.935
AS CLOSE TO YOUR OWN
AS POSSIBLE.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.603
I KNOW THE DRILL,
DETECTIVES.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.271
- RIGHT.
SORRY, CAPTAIN.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.873
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW THEY HAD,
YOU KNOW,

24:33.906 --> 24:37.610
TAPE RECORDERS WHEN YOU
GRADUATED THE ACADEMY.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.612
- AT LEAST WE DIDN'T HAVE
TO INFLATE HIS BANK ACCOUNT,

24:39.646 --> 24:41.681
'CAUSE HE HASN'T SPENT
A DOLLAR OF HIS CAPTAIN'S PAY

24:41.714 --> 24:42.882
ON HIS WARDROBE.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.184
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP, FELLAS.

24:45.217 --> 24:48.655
BUT I'VE GOT TO PREPARE
FOR MY CYBER DATE.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.222
- KNOCK IT OUT, KILLA.

24:50.256 --> 24:51.591
- I HEARD THAT!

25:05.137 --> 25:08.875
- UH, LENA'S GETTING
OUT OF THE CAB NOW.

25:08.908 --> 25:10.743
SHE ARRIVED ALONE,
BUT WE MADE TWO GUYS

25:10.777 --> 25:12.645
AT THE END OF THE BAR.

25:16.649 --> 25:19.218
SO, UM, DEFINITELY GET HER
UP TO YOUR ROOM.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.020
WE'LL MOVE IN
ONCE YOU'RE THERE.

25:23.590 --> 25:24.991
YOU'LL DO FINE.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.225
YOU LOOK GOOD.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.273
- IRENE?
- [Russian accent] YES.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.342
MICHAEL?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.712
- YOU ARE, UH,

25:45.745 --> 25:47.279
MUCH PRETTIER
THAN YOUR PICTURE.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.281
- OH, THANK YOU.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.950
AND YOU ARE HANDSOME.
- PLEASE.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.620
THEY SAY I HAVE
A FACE FOR RADIO.

25:53.653 --> 25:56.188
- DON'T SAY THAT.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.157
YOUR EYES ARE VERY KIND.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.793
- MA'AM.

26:00.827 --> 26:02.328
- UM...

26:05.264 --> 26:06.899
- WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?

26:06.933 --> 26:09.301
- CLUB SODA.

26:09.335 --> 26:12.038
I'M, UH, NOT
A DRINKING MAN ANYMORE.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.807
BUT DON'T LET THAT
SPOIL YOUR FUN.

26:14.841 --> 26:17.744
- A MAN WHO DOESN'T DRINK.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.178
YOU'RE NEW FOR ME ALREADY.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.748
[chuckles]

26:21.781 --> 26:23.683
UM, AN ORANGE JUICE,
PLEASE.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.217
CHILDREN'S RIGHTS COALITION?

26:25.251 --> 26:27.053
WHAT DO YOU DO?

26:27.086 --> 26:28.821
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT'S, UH...

26:28.855 --> 26:30.089
JUST WHAT IT SAYS.

26:30.122 --> 26:33.059
WE ADVOCATE FOR THE RIGHTS
OF CHILDREN WORLDWIDE.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.395
THERE ARE HORRIBLE ABUSES
OUT THERE.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.230
- HOW'D YOU GET
INVOLVED WITH THAT?

26:38.264 --> 26:41.701
- PROBABLY STARTED DURING
THE WAR, VIETNAM.

26:41.734 --> 26:45.037
I SAW SOME CONDITIONS
IN THE VILLAGES

26:45.071 --> 26:46.873
THAT TRULY SHOCKED ME.

26:46.906 --> 26:49.241
- SUCH SADNESS.

26:49.275 --> 26:52.078
MUST BE VERY HARD
TO DEAL WITH IT EVERY DAY.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.080
- NO, IT--
PEOPLE THINK THAT,

26:54.113 --> 26:57.416
BUT YOU'RE STANDING UP
FOR VICTIMS

26:57.449 --> 26:59.018
WHO HAVE NO VOICE.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.954
I MEAN, I WORRY
MORE ABOUT MY STAFF.

27:01.988 --> 27:07.326
THE--THE WORK REALLY
TAKES A TOLL ON THEM.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.829
- YOU WORRY ABOUT CHILDREN.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.898
YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR STAFF.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.399
WHO WORRIES ABOUT YOU?

27:19.205 --> 27:21.007
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN MARRIED,
MICHAEL?

27:21.040 --> 27:25.812
- YES.

27:25.845 --> 27:29.415
I'M A WIDOWER.

27:29.448 --> 27:32.885
MARGE, MY WIFE,

27:32.919 --> 27:36.122
I LOST HER
A LONG TIME AGO.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.692
- ANY CHILDREN?

27:42.328 --> 27:44.764
- WELL, THERE
WAS A MISCARRIAGE.

27:44.797 --> 27:48.735
AND, UH...

27:48.768 --> 27:52.004
WE TRIED...

27:52.038 --> 27:53.205
TO ADOPT.

27:55.775 --> 27:59.378
I GUESS I WAS JUST
TOO BUSY ALL THE TIME.

27:59.411 --> 28:03.916
THAT'S...
MY BIGGEST REGRET.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.853
- YOU'RE A MAN.

28:06.886 --> 28:08.721
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.391
- [chuckles]

28:12.424 --> 28:16.028
OKAY. ENOUGH
OF MY VIOLINS.

28:16.062 --> 28:18.030
ALL RIGHT?
I WANNA KNOW ABOUT YOU.

28:18.064 --> 28:20.099
WERE YOU EVER MARRIED?

28:20.132 --> 28:22.134
CHILDREN?

28:22.168 --> 28:25.237
- [giggling softly]

28:25.271 --> 28:27.740
- WHO ARE YOU, IRENE?

28:29.008 --> 28:32.411
- YOU HEAR SAD STORIES
EVERY DAY.

28:32.444 --> 28:35.982
TONIGHT, I JUST WANT
TO ENJOY.

28:36.015 --> 28:38.550
I HOPE YOU'RE
ENJOYING IT TOO.

28:42.421 --> 28:45.191
- I THINK YOU KNOW I AM.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.528
- THANK YOU.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.497
WELL...

28:51.530 --> 28:55.367
AS MY FAVORITE BARTENDER
USED TO SAY,

28:55.401 --> 28:58.037
UH, WE DON'T
HAVE TO GO HOME,

28:58.070 --> 28:59.438
BUT WE CAN'T STAY HERE.

29:01.874 --> 29:05.244
- I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.

29:07.246 --> 29:11.517
- I HAVE A ROOM UPSTAIRS.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.352
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL VIEW.

29:28.567 --> 29:31.037
OKAY?
- [whispers] THANK YOU.

29:31.070 --> 29:34.240
[elevator bell dings]

29:34.273 --> 29:36.542
- HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE?

29:36.575 --> 29:39.111
- ME? NO, NEVER.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.218
- OH. IS SOMETHING WRONG?

29:46.252 --> 29:49.822
- I'M JUST A LITTLE BIT
OLD-FASHIONED.

29:49.856 --> 29:51.958
- BUT YOU GOT A ROOM.

29:51.991 --> 29:55.527
- I WILL BE A GENTLEMAN.
I PROMISE.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.865
- MAYBE WE SHOULD
WAIT FOR A SECOND DATE.

29:58.898 --> 30:02.034
- LEN--LENA, WAIT.
WAI--DAMN IT.

30:02.068 --> 30:05.071
SHE'S ON THE MOVE.
GO! GO! GO!

30:05.104 --> 30:06.906
FREEZE!
- NO!

30:06.939 --> 30:08.307
- POLICE.
UP AGAINST THE WALL.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.876
UP AGAINST THE WALL!
- NO, NO, NO.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.879
- TURN AROUND.
GET YOUR HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

30:12.912 --> 30:14.313
- NO, YOU CAN'T ARREST ME!

30:14.346 --> 30:17.149
[crying] YOU CAN'T!
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.285
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.286
[panting]

30:20.319 --> 30:22.989
PLEASE,
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

30:23.022 --> 30:25.524
WHOEVER YOU ARE.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.259
[handcuffs snapping]

30:31.898 --> 30:34.566
- DON'T DO IT, CAPTAIN.
- WHAT'S THAT?

30:34.600 --> 30:38.504
- HAVE A DRINK.
I KNOW YOU WANT ONE.

30:38.537 --> 30:41.173
LOOK, WE CAUGHT HER.
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

30:41.207 --> 30:44.543
- SHE MADE ME...
AT THE END, SHE MADE ME.

30:44.576 --> 30:47.546
- COME ON.
DID A GOOD JOB, CAPTAIN.

30:47.579 --> 30:50.950
- IT'S NOT YOU
THAT WE REALLY WANT.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.218
IT'S LIEV.

30:52.251 --> 30:54.020
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.321
- THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU

30:55.354 --> 30:58.224
TO SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE IN JAIL.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.326
LOOK, WE UNDERSTAND
HE HAS YOU SCARED,

31:00.359 --> 31:01.460
BUT WE CAN RELOCATE YOU.

31:01.493 --> 31:02.962
PUT YOU IN WITNESS PROTECTION.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.363
- THEY WON'T GET TO YOU
OR YOUR FAMILY.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.398
THAT, WE CAN PROMISE.

31:06.432 --> 31:09.668
- I ONLY HAVE ONE DAUGHTER.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.603
AND LIEV ALREADY HAS HER.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.205
- WHAT?

31:13.239 --> 31:14.606
- HE HAS MY BABY,

31:14.640 --> 31:16.375
AND HE'S GOING TO KILL HER
IF HE FINDS OUT

31:16.408 --> 31:19.011
I'M WITH THE POLICE.

31:19.045 --> 31:21.613
THIS IS HOW
HE CONTROLS PEOPLE.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.983
DO YOU THINK
I WANNA DO THESE THINGS?

31:24.016 --> 31:26.118
- WHAT THINGS, LENA?

31:26.152 --> 31:29.989
YOU NEED TO TELL US
EVERYTHING.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.258
- LIEV RUNS MAIL-ORDER
BRIDE SITES,

31:32.291 --> 31:33.359
HERE AND IN RUSSIA.

31:33.392 --> 31:37.663
- WHICH IS JUST A FRONT
FOR HIS BLACKMAIL OPERATION.

31:37.696 --> 31:41.033
- AND PROSTITUTION.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.202
- SO TELL US
HOW THE SCAM WORKS.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.674
- I MEET WEALTHY MEN
THROUGH THE SITE,

31:48.707 --> 31:51.443
AND I MAKE THEM
FALL FOR ME.

31:51.477 --> 31:55.381
I TELL THEM
I HAVE A JEALOUS EX.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.449
I GET KIDNAPPED AND...

31:57.483 --> 31:59.518
LIEV JUST
TAKES ALL THEIR MONEY.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.088
- YOU LEFT OUT THE PART
WHERE HE KILLS AND DISFIGURES

32:02.121 --> 32:04.590
A GIRL WHO'S
SUPPOSED TO BE YOU.

32:04.623 --> 32:07.226
- YES.

32:07.259 --> 32:09.295
BUT AT FIRST, I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS KILLING THESE GIRLS.

32:09.328 --> 32:12.664
I SWEAR!
- LENA, WHOSE BODIES ARE THEY?

32:14.633 --> 32:16.368
- PROSTITUTES WHO--

32:16.402 --> 32:20.239
WHO WORK FOR LIEV, JUST...

32:20.272 --> 32:22.674
NO FAMILY, ILLEGAL.

32:22.708 --> 32:25.144
NO ONE TO MISS THEM.

32:26.145 --> 32:28.080
- NO MOTHERS
TO FORGIVE THEM.

32:28.114 --> 32:29.348
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

32:29.381 --> 32:31.083
- ALL THE BODIES HAD
"MOTHER, FORGIVE ME"

32:31.117 --> 32:31.883
TATTOOED ON THEIR HIP

32:31.917 --> 32:33.552
AND A BUTTERFLY
ON THEIR SHOULDER.

32:36.655 --> 32:39.491
- THE RUSSIAN ONE
IS HIS BRAND.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.760
THE BUTTERFLY...

32:41.793 --> 32:47.566
I HAD THAT TATTOOED BEFORE
I MET LIEV.

32:47.599 --> 32:50.436
HE SAID IT
MADE ME SPECIAL.

32:50.469 --> 32:53.739
- WELL, YOU ARE SPECIAL,
AREN'T YOU?

32:53.772 --> 32:56.375
THEY DIE AND YOU LIVE.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.410
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.412
I BEG TO STOP.

33:00.446 --> 33:04.116
BUT HE WON'T LET ME!

33:04.150 --> 33:07.353
HE SAYS I'M--
I'M THE BEST AT THIS JOB.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.721
HE HAS ME TRAPPED.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.457
- BECAUSE OF YOUR DAUGHTER?

33:11.490 --> 33:13.592
HE MOVES HER
FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY,

33:13.625 --> 33:15.727
AND I NEVER KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

33:15.761 --> 33:18.197
[crying]

33:18.230 --> 33:20.399
- DOES HE EVER
LET YOU SEE HER?

33:20.432 --> 33:21.733
- EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

33:21.767 --> 33:23.369
FOR A FEW HOURS.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.205
IN A SAFE HOUSE.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.107
AND THEN HE JUST...

33:28.140 --> 33:30.409
HE JUST TAKES HER FROM ME.

33:33.112 --> 33:35.447
CAN YOU GIVE ME MY PHONE?

33:35.481 --> 33:36.682
I SHOW YOU.

33:47.293 --> 33:49.461
MY BABY GIRL.

33:51.397 --> 33:54.100
HER NAME IS ANNA.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.073
[knock on door]

34:03.775 --> 34:06.345
- CAPTAIN, I DID A QUICK CHECK
ON LENA'S I.D.

34:06.378 --> 34:08.547
SHE IS IN THE STATES
ON AN EXPIRED WORK VISA,

34:08.580 --> 34:10.549
BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE
A CRIMINAL RECORD IN RUSSIA.

34:10.582 --> 34:12.851
- DOES SHE EVEN
HAVE A DAUGHTER?

34:12.884 --> 34:14.253
- YEAH, SHE DOES.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.654
ONE--ONE DAUGHTER
THAT'S FOUR YEARS OLD.

34:15.687 --> 34:18.124
- ALL RIGHT,
SO THAT CHECKS OUT.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.792
- OKAY, SO WE USE LENA
TO GET TO LIEV.

34:20.826 --> 34:22.428
- IF HE'S NOT ALREADY SPOOKED.

34:22.461 --> 34:24.163
- AS FAR AS LIEV KNOWS,

34:24.196 --> 34:26.265
SHE'S STILL IN THE ROOM
WITH YOU...

34:26.298 --> 34:27.666
HOOKING HER MARK.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.668
- HOW DO WE DRAW HIM OUT?

34:29.701 --> 34:31.470
- SHE'LL KNOW.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.373
WE GOT IT, CAPTAIN.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.774
- NO, NO. NO.
I'LL HANDLE IT.

34:35.807 --> 34:37.609
UH, YOU TWO
GIVE US THE ROOM.

34:37.643 --> 34:38.710
NO OFFENSE.

34:40.879 --> 34:43.449
AND SEND LENA IN.

34:43.482 --> 34:46.685
RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TO CONSIDER
YOU PART OF A CONSPIRACY

34:46.718 --> 34:48.520
TO COMMIT EXTORTION
AND MURDER.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.789
- LIEV FORCED ME!
- LISTEN TO ME!

34:50.822 --> 34:53.459
YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE
HERE, LENA.

34:53.492 --> 34:56.395
NOW, HELP YOURSELF
BY HELPING US TO GET LIEV.

34:59.831 --> 35:02.334
- I WANT MY DAUGHTER BACK.

35:02.368 --> 35:06.205
- WELL, WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.307
BUT, LENA,
YOU NEED TO COOPERATE.

35:08.340 --> 35:09.475
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

35:09.508 --> 35:10.809
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A DEAL,

35:10.842 --> 35:13.712
YOU HAVE TO TELL US EVERYTHING
ABOUT LIEV'S OPERATION.

35:13.745 --> 35:15.614
CO-CONSPIRATORS,
NAMES, VICTIMS,

35:15.647 --> 35:17.416
DATES, PLACES.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.884
YOU'LL HAVE TO TESTIFY.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.586
- NO.

35:27.226 --> 35:33.232
- OKAY.

35:33.265 --> 35:34.533
AFTER OUR DATE,

35:34.566 --> 35:36.535
WHAT WAS GOING TO BE
THE NEXT STEP WITH ME?

35:40.572 --> 35:43.542
- I WOULD CALL LIEV...

35:43.575 --> 35:46.445
AND I WOULD TELL HIM I HAVE
A BIG FISH ON THE HOOK.

35:49.948 --> 35:52.418
AND THEN I WOULD
SET UP ANOTHER DATE.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.453
- AND LIEV WOULD BE WATCHING,
RIGHT?

35:54.486 --> 35:58.424
- YES, HE ALWAYS WATCHES.

35:58.457 --> 35:59.658
- CALL HIM.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.695
SET IT UP.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.289
- I KNOW WHAT
YOU THINK OF ME.

36:30.322 --> 36:33.925
BUT WE NEED TO LOOK
LIKE WE'RE LOVERS.

36:33.959 --> 36:36.828
COME CLOSER, CAPTAIN.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.598
SMILE.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.533
I'M GONNA KISS YOU.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.569
OTHERWISE,
HE'LL KNOW, OKAY?

36:53.345 --> 36:54.613
THANK YOU.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.949
THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME
GET MY ANNA BACK.

37:39.325 --> 37:40.792
- POLICE, DROP YOUR WEAPON.

37:40.826 --> 37:41.993
[gunfire]

37:48.334 --> 37:49.768
- [screaming]
NO! STOP!

37:49.801 --> 37:51.837
NO! NO!

37:51.870 --> 37:53.572
- OKAY, BACK UP.
- LIEV!

37:53.605 --> 37:54.706
- NO, LENA, BACK UP!
- NO. LIEV.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.808
WHERE IS SHE?
WHERE IS SHE?

37:56.842 --> 37:58.009
WHERE IS SHE?!

37:58.043 --> 37:59.645
WHERE'S ANNA?!

37:59.678 --> 38:01.447
- HE'S GONE, LENA.
COME ON.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.515
- [sobbing] NO!

38:03.549 --> 38:05.917
NO....

38:05.951 --> 38:08.053
WE'LL NEVER FIND HER!

38:08.086 --> 38:10.422
WE'LL NEVER
FIND HER!

38:10.456 --> 38:12.090
HIS SOLDIERS WILL KILL HER!

38:12.123 --> 38:14.793
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?!

38:14.826 --> 38:16.695
THEY WILL KILL ANNA!

38:16.728 --> 38:18.330
[cell phone ringing]

38:21.733 --> 38:23.569
- THIS TEXT JUST CAME IN
IN RUSSIAN.

38:23.602 --> 38:25.103
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

38:25.136 --> 38:28.974
IT'S--IT'S ONE
OF LIEV'S PEOPLE

38:29.007 --> 38:33.379
ASKING WHERE
TO MEET HIM AFTER.

38:33.412 --> 38:34.846
HE'S GOT ANNA!

38:34.880 --> 38:37.683
- DO YOU KNOW THE LOCATION
OF ANY OF THE SAFE HOUSES?

38:37.716 --> 38:38.850
- YES, YES, ONE.

38:38.884 --> 38:42.020
UM, IN BRIGHTON BEACH.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.671
[crackling and clanging
on radio]

38:59.705 --> 39:00.806
- I'M SCARED.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.709
- [on radio] ONE, TWO, THREE.
- IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

39:03.742 --> 39:05.777

39:12.951 --> 39:15.921

39:15.954 --> 39:17.389
- MY DAUGHTER'S IN THERE.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.530
- WE'RE CLEAR, CAPTAIN.
THEY'RE DOWN.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.867
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!
- TAKE IT EASY.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.437
- WHO GOT HIT?

39:31.470 --> 39:32.604
- I'M OKAY, CAPTAIN.

39:32.638 --> 39:33.639
VEST GOT IT.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.173
- HE'S LUCKY AS HELL.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.843
- CAPTAIN, I JUST SEARCHED
THE HOUSE ROOM BY ROOM.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.779
I COULDN'T FIND
THE DAUGHTER ANYWHERE.

39:40.812 --> 39:41.780
[gunshots]

39:41.813 --> 39:44.483
- SHOTS FIRED!
SHOTS FIRED!

39:47.786 --> 39:50.121
- YOU READY?
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.659
I GOT IT.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.727
LENA?

39:55.761 --> 39:57.896
- LENA!

40:01.967 --> 40:03.602
- SON OF A BITCH.

40:03.635 --> 40:07.706
I GOT HER.
- AMARO, SHE'S GOT HIS GUN!

40:07.739 --> 40:10.141
- CENTRAL, BE ADVISED
THAT THE PERP IS FEMALE,

40:10.175 --> 40:13.579
BLONDE, IN HER 20s,
WITH AN OFFICER'S GUN.

40:13.612 --> 40:15.447
I WANT THIS BITCH
CAUGHT NOW!

40:15.481 --> 40:17.683

[siren blaring]

40:34.099 --> 40:35.634
[gun clatters on ground]

40:35.667 --> 40:37.736
- DON'T MOVE!

40:37.769 --> 40:39.938
DON'T MOVE, OR I'LL BLOW
YOUR DAMN HEAD OFF RIGHT NOW!

40:39.971 --> 40:42.608
- DON'T SHOOT! DON'T SHOOT!
DON'T SHOOT!

40:42.641 --> 40:43.909
- FREEZE!

40:47.979 --> 40:50.148
[sirens approaching]

41:02.628 --> 41:04.062
- GET UP.

41:08.900 --> 41:10.201
[Lena chuckling]

41:10.235 --> 41:13.104
- THE D.A. SAYS
SHE WANTS ME TO TESTIFY.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.140
DO I HAVE TO?
I'LL LOOK LIKE A FOOL.

41:15.173 --> 41:17.609
- NO, NO.
THIS WOMAN IS VERY,

41:17.643 --> 41:19.277
VERY GOOD
AT WHAT SHE DOES.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.580
ANY MAN
WOULD FALL FOR HER.

41:21.613 --> 41:24.282
- THE NEWSPAPERS SAY
SHE WALKED YOU INTO A TRAP.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.350
CLAIMED SHE
HAD A DAUGHTER?

41:25.383 --> 41:28.720
- WELL, TURNS OUT
THAT SHE DID HAVE A DAUGHTER.

41:28.754 --> 41:31.089
FOUR YEARS AGO, THE CHILD
WAS ABDUCTED AND MURDERED

41:31.122 --> 41:32.891
IN ST. PETERSBURG.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.060
LIEV FOUND THE KILLERS
AND TOOK THEM OUT.

41:35.093 --> 41:37.095
SO SINCE THEN, SHE HAS
BEEN IN LIEV'S DEBT.

41:37.128 --> 41:38.897
THEY WORK TOGETHER
AS A TEAM.

41:38.930 --> 41:40.732
- MAYBE NOT.

41:40.766 --> 41:41.867
HE MIGHT HAVE MADE HER
DO THESE THINGS.

41:41.900 --> 41:46.638
- SHE SHOT A 22-YEAR-OLD OFFICER
AT POINT BLANK RANGE.

41:46.672 --> 41:50.208
NOW, LIEV MAYBE BROUGHT HER
INTO HIS WORLD,

41:50.241 --> 41:51.910
BUT SHE HAS SINCE
CROSSED OVER.

41:53.912 --> 41:56.081
- THERE'S--THERE'S
ANOTHER SIDE OF HER.

41:56.114 --> 41:59.284
I KNOW YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT,
BUT THERE REALLY IS.

41:59.317 --> 42:02.754
- DANIEL...

42:02.788 --> 42:04.856
I BELIEVE YOU.

42:08.193 --> 42:09.995
- OKAY.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.330
I'LL DO WHAT YOU WANT.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.566
- OKAY. THANK YOU.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.537
LIV...

42:21.072 --> 42:24.643
ABOUT THAT STUFF
I SAID ON THE WIRE...

42:25.911 --> 42:27.913
- WHAT STUFF?

42:30.381 --> 42:32.250
- OKAY.
