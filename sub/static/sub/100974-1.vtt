01:07:35.083 --> 01:07:36.375
I thought you were dead.

01:07:37.625 --> 01:07:38.833
Sorry to disappoint you.

01:07:39.916 --> 01:07:41.833
What's this piece of shit doing here?

01:07:42.416 --> 01:07:43.291
That's my lawyer.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.458
And I'm the pope.

01:07:46.875 --> 01:07:50.125
I figured you'd come crawling
out of the woodwork sooner or later.

01:07:50.791 --> 01:07:54.000
Everybody comes crawling back
to Daddy in the end...

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:56.208
for a handout.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:01.000
-Where's the good stuff?
-Have a drink.

01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:04.958
Kind of disappointed, Pops.

01:08:05.041 --> 01:08:08.208
I mean, I thought you would have
some kind of Roman orgy going on

01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:09.583
with your fucking sheep.

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:13.333
Nah. I'm 100% American. Legit.

01:08:14.375 --> 01:08:15.208
Honest.

01:08:16.625 --> 01:08:18.082
I own the bank.

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:23.375
No more busting kneecaps
for 10% on the streets.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.500
We issue credit cards

01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:30.291
and charge some fuckhead farmer
from Arkansas 25%.

01:08:31.625 --> 01:08:32.750
If he don't pay,

01:08:33.666 --> 01:08:37.125
I send in the US marshal
and take his home.

01:08:38.041 --> 01:08:41.041
Takes a big man to exploit the poor.

01:08:41.457 --> 01:08:43.457
[chuckles]
Who thought it would be so easy?

01:08:43.541 --> 01:08:46.291
Still see you're having daddy issues.

01:08:46.750 --> 01:08:47.957
Like never before,

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:48.875
Daddy.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:51.416
-Yeah, we need something.
-Ah.

01:08:52.416 --> 01:08:55.625
You come here asking for something?
In the past, you just took.

01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:59.332
He's just pissed off
because I fucked his wife.

01:08:59.791 --> 01:09:01.707
Not my mother, his second wife.

01:09:02.625 --> 01:09:03.957
How is Victoria?

01:09:04.957 --> 01:09:06.166
Don't know if you heard.

01:09:07.332 --> 01:09:08.166
I shot her.

01:09:10.541 --> 01:09:13.250
Well... [sniffs] this is awkward.

01:09:16.375 --> 01:09:18.000
You fucking set me up!

01:09:19.375 --> 01:09:21.041
You tried to fucking kill me!

01:09:22.832 --> 01:09:26.957
What kind of sicko fucks his stepmother?

01:09:27.041 --> 01:09:29.041
I introduced you to her.

01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:33.332
-I gave you the world.
-You didn't give me shit!

01:09:33.416 --> 01:09:35.375
-Now, get the fuck out of here!
-Fuck you!

01:09:35.457 --> 01:09:38.125
You didn't give me shit!
You gave her everything!

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:39.957
Oh, grow up, Kevin!

01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:41.666
Grow up? Shut the fuck up!

01:09:42.416 --> 01:09:44.125
Oh, go to your party!

01:09:44.207 --> 01:09:45.957
-Go to your party!
-Do you want my tits?

01:09:46.041 --> 01:09:47.791
Do you want my shoes?

01:09:47.875 --> 01:09:49.832
-You fucking bitch.
-Oh, is that the best you got?

01:09:49.916 --> 01:09:52.041
-You fucking bitch!
-That the best you got?

01:09:52.125 --> 01:09:54.125
-Go back to your party!
-Is this okay with Daddy?

01:09:54.207 --> 01:09:56.375
-Go back to your party. Go.
-Tell him, Daddy.

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:58.958
-I'm his favorite.
-Go. Your heart is black!

01:09:59.041 --> 01:10:02.083
Your heart is black! You're dead inside!

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.291
Nah, you don't-- You know what he says?

01:10:07.375 --> 01:10:11.041
I get a call,
my father wants to apologize to me.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.541
And you know, I knew it was bullshit,

01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:15.958
but I wanted to believe it.
I really did. I wanted to believe it.

01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:18.166
I wanted to believe
that he was gonna apologize to me.

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:20.666
I don't know why.
I know I'm fucking crazy.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:21.750
You know what I got?

01:10:22.375 --> 01:10:23.458
I got that.

01:10:23.541 --> 01:10:24.833
Two bullets.

01:10:24.916 --> 01:10:27.416
That was my fucking birthday present.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.000
You tried to fucking kill me

01:10:29.208 --> 01:10:30.916
like you killed my mother.

01:10:33.541 --> 01:10:36.291
If you think I'm going to apologize,
you're wrong.

01:10:37.416 --> 01:10:38.958
We all use each other.

01:10:46.041 --> 01:10:48.666
And we all hate each other.

01:10:50.083 --> 01:10:51.083
I'm sorry, Bricke.

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.583
-[gunshot]
-[Kevin cries out]

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:12.833
Fuck.

01:11:13.708 --> 01:11:14.958
[groaning]

01:11:15.041 --> 01:11:16.958
Fucking psycho! What did you do?

01:11:17.041 --> 01:11:18.541
I got fucking shot.

01:11:18.625 --> 01:11:20.750
-Did you kill your father, you asshole?
-Yes, I did.

01:11:20.833 --> 01:11:23.041
Get me up. I got a fucking plan!

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:27.583
[breathing heavily, grunting]

01:11:28.458 --> 01:11:29.666
What's the fucking plan?

01:11:30.291 --> 01:11:31.375
[Kevin] Just give me a second.

01:11:33.916 --> 01:11:34.958
[beeping]

01:11:39.083 --> 01:11:40.666
What the fuck is going on?
We gotta go.

01:11:41.791 --> 01:11:43.500
-[buzzing]
-[Kevin] Trust me.

01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:47.875
Sorry, Pops.

01:11:47.958 --> 01:11:48.958
[hand scanner beeping]

01:11:49.041 --> 01:11:50.041
Why are you locking the door?

01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:52.250
[Kevin] Fucking son of a bitch,
you had to shoot me.

01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:56.291
All right?

01:12:00.166 --> 01:12:02.166
Come on. Where the fuck are they at?

01:12:03.541 --> 01:12:04.375
Fuck.

01:12:06.875 --> 01:12:07.708
Yes!

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.500
[banging on door]

01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:16.458
[Lonnie] Open up!

01:12:20.125 --> 01:12:21.125
[Kevin] Trust me.

01:12:38.458 --> 01:12:41.375
Piece of shit motherfucker!

01:12:46.208 --> 01:12:47.916
Die, you motherfuckers!

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.708
It's clear. Blow that fucking wall.

01:13:21.791 --> 01:13:22.791
What the fuck? Let's go.

01:13:33.583 --> 01:13:34.416
Come on.

01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:36.458
[gun fires]

01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:37.541
[Kevin] Fuck.

01:13:37.625 --> 01:13:38.500
[gasping]

01:13:40.083 --> 01:13:40.958
[Bricke] Cash!

01:13:42.833 --> 01:13:44.000
Cash! Let's go!

01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:47.333
Come on!

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.875
-Fucking Connie.
-Come on!

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.458
Son of a bitch!

01:14:20.583 --> 01:14:21.458
[man] After them!

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:23.833
[gunfire]

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:37.750
If this gunshot doesn't kill me,
your driving is.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.166
[sirens wailing in distance]

01:14:43.666 --> 01:14:44.750
[groans]

01:14:44.833 --> 01:14:48.000
Lonnie will be looking for you.
Get yourself cleaned up.

01:14:48.333 --> 01:14:49.500
See you at the train station.

01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:51.708
[car engine starts]

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.000
Bricke, you're bleeding.

01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:26.041
Not my blood. Your boyfriend's.

01:15:34.125 --> 01:15:35.250
I know about the girl.

01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:48.333
I can explain.

01:15:49.208 --> 01:15:50.041
What?

01:15:52.333 --> 01:15:53.916
How you sold us out to the FBI?

01:15:57.833 --> 01:15:59.000
She's my sister.

01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:04.375
I told you I can explain.

01:16:14.416 --> 01:16:16.125
Maybe this is what we both wanted.

01:16:17.375 --> 01:16:18.791
-[footsteps approach]
-[thud]

01:16:22.708 --> 01:16:24.250
[match lighting]

01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:25.166
[Lonnie] Bricke.

01:16:40.083 --> 01:16:43.083
[breathing heavily]

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.208
[yells]

01:16:52.875 --> 01:16:55.541
[breathing heavily]

01:16:55.625 --> 01:16:56.708
Listen to me, Bricke.

01:16:58.166 --> 01:16:59.791
I have guys all over this town,

01:16:59.875 --> 01:17:02.041
anywhere anyone has ever seen Kevin.

01:17:02.125 --> 01:17:03.750
So it's just a matter of time.

01:17:03.875 --> 01:17:06.583
Something I have, you don't...
[exhales]

01:17:13.458 --> 01:17:14.833
Who the fuck are you again?

01:17:16.833 --> 01:17:18.041
I'm just a call girl.

01:17:18.791 --> 01:17:19.875
[inhales sharply]

01:17:20.416 --> 01:17:23.708
Then you won't mind
if I torture this cocksucker to death?

01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:25.125
Huh?

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:28.958
You really call this call girl, man?

01:17:32.416 --> 01:17:34.916
[grunts, sighs]

01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:42.500
This is your last chance, Bricke.

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:44.625
[Bricke] For what?

01:17:46.916 --> 01:17:48.000
My lap dance?

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:52.541
[laughing]

01:17:55.458 --> 01:17:56.583
Yeah.

01:17:57.166 --> 01:17:58.583
I'll be your bitch.

01:18:03.166 --> 01:18:05.166
You've just got a be a little more, uh...

01:18:06.166 --> 01:18:07.916
comprehensive to me, alright?

01:18:09.583 --> 01:18:13.041
Where's Kevin?
I'm not fucking asking you again!

01:18:13.125 --> 01:18:13.958
[gun cocks]

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:15.625
[Shelby] Wait!

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:18.750
[breathing heavily] Hmm?

01:18:19.291 --> 01:18:20.791
I'm who you want.

01:18:23.875 --> 01:18:25.500
[breathing heavily] She's lying.

01:18:26.666 --> 01:18:27.958
Kevin Cash.

01:18:28.666 --> 01:18:31.291
Calls himself Cash
'cause he can't stand Dumois.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.125
And he's got a fiancée

01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:36.333
who he will do just about anything for.

01:18:37.541 --> 01:18:38.375
Me.

01:18:39.208 --> 01:18:40.708
Yeah.

01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:43.750
Oh, yeah.

01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:46.791
[exhales]

01:18:48.416 --> 01:18:49.458
So...

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.666
take her to the car.

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:57.958
Wait for me.
I wanna ask her a couple of questions.

01:18:58.041 --> 01:18:59.250
-[Bricke] No.
-[Lonnie] Yeah.

01:18:59.333 --> 01:19:01.458
Yeah, come on! [cackling]

01:19:02.208 --> 01:19:03.041
Fucker!

01:19:04.291 --> 01:19:06.291
[breathing heavily]

01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:09.541
[grunts, pants]

01:19:25.083 --> 01:19:26.958
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

01:19:29.708 --> 01:19:30.958
Maybe you met him before.

01:19:43.833 --> 01:19:45.125
You boys have fun now.

01:19:47.666 --> 01:19:51.000
-[door opening]
-[footsteps approaching]

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:17.541
Now, you see,
I thought that you might wanna see this.

01:20:40.666 --> 01:20:41.500
Hiya, Bricke.

01:20:46.291 --> 01:20:47.750
I thought you'd quit smoking.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.083
You're right, Bricke.

01:20:52.541 --> 01:20:53.458
I should quit.

01:20:55.333 --> 01:20:59.291
But I had some other priorities before.

01:21:03.916 --> 01:21:04.916
Gotta tell ya,

01:21:05.916 --> 01:21:07.333
a moment like this,

01:21:09.958 --> 01:21:11.375
I've been waiting for it.

01:21:20.833 --> 01:21:22.166
I guess you can say...

01:21:22.916 --> 01:21:24.708
it gave me a reason to live.

01:21:29.625 --> 01:21:31.625
[breathing heavily]

01:21:33.791 --> 01:21:35.416
Wasn't much water on the floor.

01:21:35.500 --> 01:21:37.041
[sets down gas can forcefully]

01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:42.125
It took me a long minute to roll around
and put myself out.

01:21:47.208 --> 01:21:48.666
Showed me what I was made of.

01:21:50.458 --> 01:21:51.291
You kinda owe me one.

01:21:54.583 --> 01:21:56.666
[panting]

01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:58.916
-You kinda owe me one, right?
-Yeah.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:00.625
-You kinda owe me one, don't you?
-Yeah.

01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:02.166
[growling]

01:22:02.708 --> 01:22:03.541
[yelling] Yeah.

01:22:03.625 --> 01:22:05.833
[breathing heavily]

01:22:12.166 --> 01:22:14.166
[gasping in pain]

01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:27.208
Tell me, Bricke.

01:22:27.666 --> 01:22:29.250
[breathing heavily]

01:22:29.333 --> 01:22:31.500
You got something to live for? Huh?

01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:44.416
[breathing heavily]

01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:58.583
[Shelby] Bricke!

01:22:59.250 --> 01:23:00.791
No! Bricke!

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:01.958
Bricke!

01:23:02.583 --> 01:23:03.750
Bricke!

01:23:04.916 --> 01:23:05.750
Bricke!

01:24:18.875 --> 01:24:21.583
[coughing]

01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:26.791
[alarm sounding]

01:49:50.333 --> 01:49:52.041
[muffled cries]

01:49:57.625 --> 01:49:58.750
What the fuck's going on?

01:49:58.833 --> 01:50:00.833
She's in the server room, to the left.

01:50:07.666 --> 01:50:10.041
Freeze! Freeze!

01:50:11.958 --> 01:50:13.041
Are you alone?

01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:18.125
Sir, she betrayed me.

01:50:18.583 --> 01:50:19.833
Get out. Get down.

01:50:20.333 --> 01:50:21.750
[Carl]
What're you gonna do with her?

01:50:29.041 --> 01:50:33.250
I need you to tell me
what the fuck is going on right now.

01:51:19.333 --> 01:51:20.375
Six minutes, Ross.

01:51:24.666 --> 01:51:25.500
Cover the truck.

01:51:28.625 --> 01:51:30.083
[alarm sounding]

01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:37.375
-[computer beeps]
-[tech] There we go.

01:51:37.458 --> 01:51:40.250
-[high-pitched ringing resumes]
-[groaning]

01:51:46.625 --> 01:51:47.541
Call her!

01:51:47.625 --> 01:51:48.625
It's on.

01:51:52.125 --> 01:51:53.583
-[gun fires]
-[yells]

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:55.916
[gasping]

01:52:01.208 --> 01:52:03.375
Oh, shit. Did I just do that?

01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:07.583
-What did you do?
-Look at you.

01:52:08.375 --> 01:52:10.958
-You're like a lion with no balls.
-What are you doing?

01:52:11.041 --> 01:52:12.916
Everyone's at the zoo, staring at him.

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.125
Look, it's a lion with no fucking balls.

01:52:15.375 --> 01:52:16.208
Don't.

01:52:16.708 --> 01:52:17.833
Don't do it, please.

01:52:18.166 --> 01:52:19.541
Don't do it. Don't do what?

01:52:20.083 --> 01:52:21.541
-Don't...
-Please don't do it.

01:52:21.625 --> 01:52:23.791
Please don't do what? What shouldn't I do?

01:52:23.875 --> 01:52:25.875
-Please don't do this. Stop!
-What?

01:52:25.958 --> 01:52:27.500
-Not kill your best friend?
-Stop!

01:52:28.541 --> 01:52:31.166
-No!
-[Kevin] What are you doing? Huh?

01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:32.333
What do you wanna do?

01:52:32.708 --> 01:52:33.875
-Huh?
-[Bricke groans]

01:52:34.375 --> 01:52:35.666
Oh, you wanna dance.

01:52:36.291 --> 01:52:37.125
[Bricke screams]

01:52:37.208 --> 01:52:41.291
You're never there
for the people you love. [yells]

01:52:41.375 --> 01:52:42.750
-[thudding]
-[Bricke groans]

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.458
[choking]

01:52:46.541 --> 01:52:47.375
Come on.

01:52:48.416 --> 01:52:49.791
I got a secret to tell you.

01:52:51.208 --> 01:52:52.833
You need to pay attention to this.

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:02.625
[Kevin]
Every Friday, we'd meet in the yard.

01:53:03.583 --> 01:53:04.500
They'd yell,

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:05.833
"Fight!"

01:53:07.833 --> 01:53:10.750
and get us to do
the nastiest shit to each other.

01:53:13.708 --> 01:53:15.125
[dog barking]

01:53:20.041 --> 01:53:21.041
[high-pitched ringing]

01:53:21.125 --> 01:53:23.333
[Kevin] And then,
they would turn on the brain rape.

01:53:29.666 --> 01:53:31.666
[grunting]

01:53:35.083 --> 01:53:37.583
-Get in there!
-[Kevin] You ever read William Burroughs?

01:53:37.666 --> 01:53:43.166
He had a thing called "the cop within,"
you know, morality, right, wrong.

01:53:44.791 --> 01:53:45.666
[high-pitched ringing]

01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:48.875
[Kevin] Turns out,
even a sociopathic fucker like me has one.

01:53:51.500 --> 01:53:52.541
[groaning]

01:53:53.125 --> 01:53:53.958
Motherfucker!

01:53:54.041 --> 01:53:55.291
[yelling]

01:53:56.916 --> 01:53:59.875
[Kevin]
And I had something else nobody else had:

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.125
time to figure it out,

01:54:03.708 --> 01:54:04.875
time to practice.

01:54:14.208 --> 01:54:15.291
[high-pitched ringing]

01:54:16.458 --> 01:54:17.333
[Kevin] And finally,

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:20.833
one day...

01:54:22.708 --> 01:54:23.625
I get clarity...

01:54:27.041 --> 01:54:31.375
that absolutely nothing meant anything.

01:54:34.875 --> 01:54:37.041
[barking]

01:54:37.125 --> 01:54:38.708
[yelling]

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.083
[Kevin] And Jesus Christ as my witness,

01:54:45.250 --> 01:54:46.291
that set me free.

01:55:14.125 --> 01:55:15.333
Come on, shoot me.

01:55:16.083 --> 01:55:17.541
Fucking shoot me!

01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:22.625
You know actually killing your brother
got me out of jail?

01:55:23.791 --> 01:55:24.958
Can you believe that?

01:55:25.333 --> 01:55:27.500
I mean, motherfucker!

01:55:29.666 --> 01:55:31.583
Cruel and unusual punishment?

01:55:35.125 --> 01:55:36.500
Human experiments?

01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:39.708
My lawyers had a field day with that one.

01:55:46.583 --> 01:55:48.916
They didn't realize what a gift it was.

01:55:49.791 --> 01:55:51.083
Take Dupree with you.

01:55:53.625 --> 01:55:56.333
[Kevin] Um, I'm not sure
if you're listening to me.

01:55:57.250 --> 01:55:59.375
I don't feel anything anymore.

01:55:59.833 --> 01:56:02.833
Not for you
and certainly not for that bitch.

01:56:03.416 --> 01:56:04.833
[laughing] You can have that one.

01:56:06.083 --> 01:56:08.291
What are you doing?
Trying to shoot me again?

01:56:10.958 --> 01:56:12.083
Come on, try.

01:56:23.125 --> 01:56:24.625
Oh, that felt good.

01:56:25.625 --> 01:56:26.958
Are we still friends?

01:56:28.625 --> 01:56:29.791
I didn't mean it.

01:56:29.875 --> 01:56:31.166
[Bricke groans]

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:36.708
[humming]

01:56:36.791 --> 01:56:39.166
Pussy. That's your problem.
That's your problem.

01:56:39.250 --> 01:56:41.375
You know, I actually like you, Bricke.

01:56:41.458 --> 01:56:42.583
I really do.

01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:44.083
Bricke.

01:56:45.208 --> 01:56:46.666
How about one more? [pumps shotgun]

01:56:51.708 --> 01:56:52.583
Huh?

01:56:54.208 --> 01:56:55.166
What was that?

01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:56.500
I can't hear you.

01:56:57.291 --> 01:56:58.666
Speak into my good ear.

01:57:00.291 --> 01:57:01.125
Bricke.

01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:02.916
Come on, Brickey.

01:57:03.250 --> 01:57:04.250
Bricke, wake up!

01:57:05.625 --> 01:57:08.125
You know what
the really fucked-up thing is?

01:57:09.125 --> 01:57:10.208
In this world...

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.166
unfortunately,

01:57:12.916 --> 01:57:14.666
that makes me the superhero.

01:57:15.791 --> 01:57:17.875
[laughing]

01:57:17.958 --> 01:57:19.833
What, are you smiling? [laughing]

01:57:21.208 --> 01:57:22.208
Why are you smiling?

01:57:22.583 --> 01:57:23.500
Something funny?

01:57:24.833 --> 01:57:27.041
You're a tough son of a bitch,
you know that?

01:57:27.375 --> 01:57:30.583
[both laughing]

01:57:30.666 --> 01:57:32.375
I mean, I'm impressed.

01:57:34.791 --> 01:57:36.125
Are you bulletproof?

01:57:36.250 --> 01:57:37.208
Am I what?

01:57:42.416 --> 01:57:43.333
[yells]

01:57:44.041 --> 01:57:44.958
Fucker!

01:57:49.166 --> 01:57:50.708
High middle, not bad.

01:57:51.458 --> 01:57:53.125
Maybe down a touch.

01:57:53.666 --> 01:57:55.166
Three points for the next one.

01:57:58.416 --> 01:58:00.291
Fucking-- [yells]

01:58:02.916 --> 01:58:04.083
[FBI agent] Ouch, that hurt.

01:58:05.125 --> 01:58:07.833
Okay. Take the final one.
I'm getting bored.

01:58:08.375 --> 01:58:09.833
But I'm not done playing yet.

01:58:09.916 --> 01:58:10.875
I said, end it.

01:58:14.750 --> 01:58:17.750
You fucking piece of shit motherfucker!

01:58:17.833 --> 01:58:21.750
You motherfucking piece of shit!

01:58:24.791 --> 01:58:26.666
You fucking bitch-ass mother--

01:59:10.333 --> 01:59:11.375
Bricke, right?

01:59:13.333 --> 01:59:14.375
How you doing?

01:59:18.125 --> 01:59:19.333
Doesn't look good.

01:59:20.625 --> 01:59:24.041
Hey. Thanks for helping with this, Bricke.
You did a great job.

01:59:25.125 --> 01:59:27.125
Finally got this motherfucker.

01:59:28.625 --> 01:59:29.958
I owe you a medal.

01:59:31.833 --> 01:59:34.708
Now all we need to do is find
this three-way thing's girlfriend,

01:59:34.791 --> 01:59:36.416
and we can end this chapter permanently.

01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:38.500
[breathing heavily]

01:59:42.333 --> 01:59:43.750
[Bricke] You promised her.

01:59:44.250 --> 01:59:46.500
Yeah, I remember, but you know what?

01:59:47.333 --> 01:59:48.541
Things are changing.

01:59:49.041 --> 01:59:51.250
Everything's moving like planets.

01:59:52.166 --> 01:59:54.750
We're not gonna keep that promise,
are we, Posner?

01:59:56.041 --> 01:59:58.125
I'm afraid not. [chuckles]

01:59:58.541 --> 02:00:00.208
Sorry, Bricke. [chuckles]

02:00:01.208 --> 02:00:02.708
[FBI agent] What about you, now? Hmm?

02:00:03.333 --> 02:00:04.666
I mean, I'm no doctor,

02:00:05.291 --> 02:00:06.750
but I think he won't make it.

02:00:07.375 --> 02:00:08.458
Oh, he won't.

02:00:10.458 --> 02:00:13.625
-Should I finish him?
-Uh-uh, don't waste a bullet for a dog.

02:00:14.083 --> 02:00:16.625
Let him die, slowly.

02:00:18.125 --> 02:00:19.750
One last promise.

02:00:21.416 --> 02:00:22.708
I will care for her...

02:00:24.041 --> 02:00:25.375
with tenderness.

02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:28.666
Yeah.

02:01:24.708 --> 02:01:25.708
[grunts]

02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:29.500
[grunts]

02:01:46.208 --> 02:01:47.708
You know what I could do with now?

02:01:48.250 --> 02:01:49.291
Coffee and pussy?

02:01:49.625 --> 02:01:51.583
You got the pussy right. [laughs]

02:01:55.291 --> 02:01:56.583
[grunting]

02:02:29.291 --> 02:02:30.916

[wheezing, coughing]

02:03:27.583 --> 02:03:29.583
[Sawyer] I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

02:03:30.291 --> 02:03:33.416
I just need you to tell me
what is going on.

02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:36.125
You can talk to me. I can help you.

02:03:36.458 --> 02:03:39.666
I'm gonna put this down, okay?
I'm gonna put this down.

02:03:40.291 --> 02:03:41.708
[yells]

02:03:42.500 --> 02:03:43.791
Get off me!

02:03:46.166 --> 02:03:48.000
-[grunting]
-[yelling]

02:03:48.083 --> 02:03:49.458
Fucking bitch.

02:04:22.875 --> 02:04:25.333
[breathing heavily]

02:04:30.958 --> 02:04:33.208
[both grunting]

02:04:33.625 --> 02:04:34.583
Settle down.

02:04:34.666 --> 02:04:35.875
You have the right to--

02:04:36.375 --> 02:04:38.333
You have the right to remain silent.

02:04:38.833 --> 02:04:43.166
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

02:04:43.250 --> 02:04:44.916
in a court of-- Fuck.

02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:05.708
-Coward.
-You see this?

02:05:07.125 --> 02:05:09.458
-Stop fucking around!
-Bitch.

02:05:14.458 --> 02:05:16.083
What the fuck is wrong with you?

02:05:17.208 --> 02:05:21.583
What the fuck is wrong with you?

02:05:25.333 --> 02:05:26.708
-[kicks]
-[Sawyer groans]

02:05:45.041 --> 02:05:46.791

[machine beeping]

02:08:30.291 --> 02:08:31.500
[security guard] Go! Go! Go!

02:08:33.208 --> 02:08:34.041
Stop!

02:08:47.375 --> 02:08:48.500
Stop!

02:08:50.208 --> 02:08:52.208
I said stop! Get your ass on the ground.

02:08:53.208 --> 02:08:54.333
We will shoot you.

02:08:54.416 --> 02:08:55.458
Get down!

02:08:56.708 --> 02:08:58.125
Down on the ground.

02:09:00.166 --> 02:09:02.291
Hands in the air!
Get down on your knees, now!

02:09:02.958 --> 02:09:03.958
We will shoot!

02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:05.750
You got five seconds.

02:09:06.250 --> 02:09:07.125
