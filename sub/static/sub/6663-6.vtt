with him every year.

01:15.276 --> 01:18.210
I know. It's Evan Turner.
He invited me out.

01:18.212 --> 01:21.280
He's super cool, and he
likes me for some reason.

Evan Turner?
Who's Evan Turner?
I don't know any Evan Turner.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.587
That's because he runs
in higher circles than I do.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.356
For god sake, he wears
a shark tooth necklace.

01:31.358 --> 01:34.726

administrators allow that?

01:34.728 --> 01:36.428

someone's eye out.

01:37.498 --> 01:40.165
No! He's nice.
His dad owns an Arby's.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.835
He gets free roast beef

01:42.837 --> 01:45.237

free roast beef.

talking about?

out of his toy-box costume.

02:04.057 --> 02:04.690
This doesn't help.

ditching your grandfather.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.229
Pops looks forward
to this every year.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.431

Well, sorry to
ruin your night.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.012
Actually,
I ruined your night.

18:01.014 --> 18:05.349
I sort of mentioned
to mom that you were
gonna ask Lexy out.

18:05.351 --> 18:08.686
What? You might as well have
driven her there yourself.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.789
I know! Sometimes I forget
how crazy she is.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.125
How can you forget that?

18:15.160 --> 18:17.428
I'm sorry...

18:17.430 --> 18:18.830
For real.

18:18.832 --> 18:21.899
After tonight, I'm thinking
if we don't look out
for each other,

18:21.901 --> 18:25.369
we're never gonna make it
out of this house alive.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.271
Agreed.

18:29.475 --> 18:30.241
Listen...

18:30.243 --> 18:33.144
There's another party
at Allison Brenner's.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.445
Could be fun.

18:34.447 --> 18:37.849
I think she said
you were kinda cute.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.251
Say no more.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.619
Hulk ready to rock!

18:41.621 --> 18:42.353
Yeah, don't talk like that.

You're missing a spot.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.669
You're missing a spot.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.973
You're missing a spot
over and over.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.175
I get it. You're angry.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.476
(SCOFFS)
I said I was sorry.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.112
Not good enough.
I went to bat for you.

19:08.114 --> 19:10.014
I told your mom
that you were an adult.

19:10.016 --> 19:13.417
And what do you do?
You go act like a giant moron.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.352
Not by choice.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.121
All I wanted to do
was dress up,

19:17.123 --> 19:19.290
eat some candy,
and have fun.

19:19.292 --> 19:20.191
Then why the hell didn't you?

19:20.193 --> 19:23.027
'Cause no one
else wanted to!

19:25.764 --> 19:26.764
Yeah, you're at
that weird age

19:26.766 --> 19:30.501
between being a dumb kid
and a stupid grownup.

19:30.503 --> 19:34.438
I just wish things could
stay the same, you know?

19:34.640 --> 19:35.640
Yeah.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.876
Yeah, I get it. I get it.

19:38.878 --> 19:39.710
Well...

19:39.712 --> 19:43.314
Maybe your friends
have grown out
of trick-or-treating,
