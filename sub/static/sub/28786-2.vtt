WEBVTT

00:11.965 --> 00:13.620
- Nice pantsuit.

00:13.689 --> 00:16.689
Did your funeral director's
license finally come through?

00:16.758 --> 00:18.965
- Ha-ha.
Everyone at work now knows

00:19.034 --> 00:21.172
that I'm the assistant Charles
was having the affair with,

00:21.241 --> 00:23.517
so I don't want them to look at
me and think, "sex, sex, sex."

00:23.586 --> 00:25.655
- Well, mission accomplished.

00:25.724 --> 00:27.551
Hey, did you get
one of these?

00:30.275 --> 00:31.620
- "Even though
we're all post-gender,

00:31.689 --> 00:33.482
"we're not post-gender-reveal.

00:33.551 --> 00:35.034
"Come find out
if the baby's a girl,

00:35.103 --> 00:37.827
a boy, or TBD
this Saturday."

00:37.896 --> 00:39.655
Oh, how fun.

00:39.724 --> 00:41.620
- Yeah, I still
don't trust that Clare.

00:41.689 --> 00:43.103
- Well, you certainly
liked her mother.

00:43.172 --> 00:44.379
- That was missionary work.

00:44.448 --> 00:45.620
You know,
you visit the natives,

00:45.689 --> 00:46.862
you show them
the way to heaven...

00:46.931 --> 00:48.068
- Well, we're going.

00:48.137 --> 00:50.482
I like Clare now.
And Josh is happy.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.137
Happy and scared.
This is a big change.

00:53.206 --> 00:54.551
- Yeah, well,
speaking of change,

00:54.620 --> 00:56.103
that pussy-bow
needs to go.

00:56.172 --> 00:58.310
I mean, you look like
Nancy Pelosi on the bottom

00:58.379 --> 00:59.551
and Melania Trump
on top.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.793
- Oh, that's no fun
for anyone.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.517
- ♪ Uh-huh ♪

01:07.586 --> 01:09.965
♪ Gotta be,
you gotta be a good girl ♪

01:13.413 --> 01:15.482
- So we sent the book out
to readers

01:15.551 --> 01:17.379
from some of your target demos

01:17.448 --> 01:19.827
and we got some
very strong data.

01:19.896 --> 01:21.689
Um, I have a report here
if you'd like--

01:21.758 --> 01:23.758
- I'm sorry, I've been
in publishing for 20 years.

01:23.827 --> 01:27.482
Since when do we use focus
groups to vet our authors?

01:27.551 --> 01:29.517
- Since I'm the publisher.

01:29.586 --> 01:31.241
And this is my first release,

01:31.310 --> 01:32.655
it needs to be
the right one.

01:32.724 --> 01:34.758
- And I think "CLAW"
still needs more work,

01:34.827 --> 01:37.103
and Quinn has been very
resistant to my suggestions.

01:37.172 --> 01:39.620
- Oh, look at you two.

01:39.689 --> 01:41.172
Acting like you have a choice.

01:41.241 --> 01:42.689
We work for her now.

01:42.758 --> 01:45.172
So we are happy--
no, thrilled--

01:45.241 --> 01:46.862
to debut with her...
book.

01:46.931 --> 01:49.206
- Okay,
so, the highlight reel.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.448
- I think this is so smart.
- Me too.

01:51.517 --> 01:54.448
- I hated it.
It is so offensive to women.

01:54.517 --> 01:55.965
- Who wrote this? It's insane.

01:56.034 --> 01:58.517
And I'm from Florida
so, like, I know.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.482
- It's Machiavellian,
it's inhuman.

02:00.551 --> 02:02.689
- I hate this book
and I hate the people

02:02.758 --> 02:04.965
who are giving
this woman a voice.

02:05.034 --> 02:06.689
- It made my shingles
flare up.

02:06.758 --> 02:08.517
- I'd just like to un-read it.

02:08.586 --> 02:09.724
Please, is there--is there
some way

02:09.793 --> 02:12.241
to un-read something?

02:12.310 --> 02:13.965
- Wow.
- So what I heard

02:14.034 --> 02:16.931
is that
there are strong reactions.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.413
Which is good.

02:19.482 --> 02:21.344
Or it could be good.

02:24.862 --> 02:27.793
Our bill.

02:27.862 --> 02:29.275
Bye-bye.

02:35.379 --> 02:36.862
- I'm so sorry, Kels.

02:36.931 --> 02:39.000
I have tried to get Quinn
to soften the tone,

02:39.068 --> 02:41.379
but she--she rejected
every edit.

02:42.482 --> 02:43.413
How am I supposed to tell

02:43.482 --> 02:45.206
the woman who gave me my job

02:45.275 --> 02:46.413
that her book sucks?

02:46.482 --> 02:48.137
- How?

02:48.206 --> 02:50.551
- Oof,
that is a toughie.

02:50.620 --> 02:52.793
But you are
the publisher now.

02:52.862 --> 02:54.793
So good luck.

03:01.241 --> 03:03.310
- Well, she looks like
she's in a good mood.

03:03.379 --> 03:04.896
- Yeah,
I'll take care of that.

03:04.965 --> 03:06.758
Hi, Quinn.
- Sorry I'm late, girls.

03:06.827 --> 03:08.724
I know I'm not supposed
to say "girls" anymore,

03:08.793 --> 03:10.793
but who gives a--
champagne.

03:10.862 --> 03:12.931
- Yes.
- This is gonna be fun.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.310
- I wanted you
to know how much

03:14.379 --> 03:15.517
I appreciate
your support and--

03:15.586 --> 03:16.758
- Yeah, me first.

03:16.827 --> 03:19.275
I got a little something
for you two.

03:19.344 --> 03:21.310
- Oh.

03:21.379 --> 03:22.862
- Oh, my God!

03:22.931 --> 03:24.793
- There's only 20 in there,
the rest are at your office.

03:24.862 --> 03:27.000
I hope I got your
titles right.

03:27.068 --> 03:29.206
Publisher.
Editor.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.724
- It's so heavy.
I-is this gold?

03:31.793 --> 03:33.137
- Yeah.

03:33.206 --> 03:34.344
I know it's silly.

03:34.413 --> 03:36.241
Nobody uses
business cards anymore,

03:36.310 --> 03:37.862
but publishing
is so uncertain.

03:37.931 --> 03:39.827
It's good to have something
you can take with you

03:39.896 --> 03:42.310
if you have to,
you know, leave suddenly.

03:42.379 --> 03:43.655
Poor Charles.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.655
Anyway, uh, Liza said
that you had something

03:46.724 --> 03:48.103
you wanted to talk
to me about, Kelsey?

03:48.172 --> 03:49.310
I am all ears.

03:49.379 --> 03:50.965
- Yeah, well,

03:51.034 --> 03:53.586
we were talking
and we think that we should

03:53.655 --> 03:56.034
hold "CLAW" for the spring.

03:56.103 --> 03:57.827
There's just a little bit
of work that can be done

03:57.896 --> 03:59.758
on the tone of the book.
- Yeah.

03:59.827 --> 04:01.000
- In today's climate,
you know,

04:01.068 --> 04:03.034
it can skew
a little anti-woman.

04:03.103 --> 04:04.793
- Yeah, I like that.
It's controversial.

04:04.862 --> 04:06.275
I'm the writer,
you're the publisher.

04:06.344 --> 04:07.620
Let's just both do our jobs.

04:07.689 --> 04:08.655
- And I'm your editor.

04:08.724 --> 04:09.965
So I have to say,

04:10.034 --> 04:12.000
it's a give-and-take
collaboration.

04:12.068 --> 04:13.931
If a writer doesn't
wanna take notes,

04:14.000 --> 04:16.517
then they might as well
self-publish.

04:16.586 --> 04:18.931
- Yeah, I think
I'm kind of doing that.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.620
Do you remember
when I saved your company

04:20.689 --> 04:22.241
and then I made you
publisher?

04:22.310 --> 04:23.724
I cheered you on.

04:23.793 --> 04:25.172
Now it's your turn
to cheer me.

04:26.793 --> 04:30.137
- And I really am grateful
for that, Quinn, um...

04:30.206 --> 04:33.172
it just--it doesn't
really work like that.

04:33.241 --> 04:34.344
- What's happening?

04:34.413 --> 04:35.517
- State cheerleading champs,
1998.

04:35.586 --> 04:36.931
My first big win.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.827
I do think you tried to cut this
from the book.

04:38.896 --> 04:40.448
- Uh, yeah, there was--there was
a lot of high school stuff

04:40.517 --> 04:41.793
in there, Quinn.

04:41.862 --> 04:43.241
-  Guess who
wrote a masterpiece.

04:43.310 --> 04:45.068
You repeat after me,
that's how a chant works, right?

04:45.137 --> 04:47.310
Guess who wrote
a masterpiece.

04:49.206 --> 04:52.103
Guess who wrote a masterpiece.
Take it, Big K!

04:52.172 --> 04:53.689
- Big K.

04:53.758 --> 04:55.241
Guess who wrote a masterpiece.

04:55.310 --> 04:56.862
- It will be
our first release!

04:56.931 --> 04:59.034
It will be
our first release.

04:59.103 --> 05:01.137
It will be our first release.

05:01.206 --> 05:03.172
- Right, but now like
you're not terrified.

05:03.241 --> 05:05.448
all: It will be
our first release!

05:05.517 --> 05:07.000
Guess who wrote a masterpiece!

05:07.068 --> 05:08.827
It will be
our first release!

05:08.896 --> 05:10.379
- Yeah!
- Isn't this fun?

05:10.448 --> 05:11.724
- Yeah!
- So fun.

05:11.793 --> 05:12.862
Are you crying?

05:12.931 --> 05:14.068
- What the hell was that?

05:14.137 --> 05:15.517
- Chapter three
of "CLAW."

05:15.586 --> 05:17.000
Charm and Disarm.

05:17.068 --> 05:18.758
- It's not about
what she did.

05:18.827 --> 05:20.517
It's about
what I didn't do.

05:20.586 --> 05:22.068
If I can't stand up
to Quinn,

05:22.137 --> 05:24.379
how the hell am I
supposed to do this job?

05:24.448 --> 05:26.172
I'm just a name
on a card.

05:26.241 --> 05:28.655
- No, Kelsey, you're not.
- Oh, my God.

05:28.724 --> 05:30.344
I'm screwed.
Face it, Liza,

05:30.413 --> 05:32.103
we're both screwed.

05:43.413 --> 05:44.793
- I'm a genius.

05:44.862 --> 05:46.379
- Absolutely.
Why?

05:46.448 --> 05:47.551
I mean, uh,
what's that?

05:47.620 --> 05:49.206
- It's the book
we publish first,

05:49.275 --> 05:51.482
before "CLAW."

05:51.551 --> 05:52.931
- But it's a screenplay.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.586
- It's the movie that
Reese Witherspoon's company

05:54.655 --> 05:55.931
is producing.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.965
I had breakfast with
her development exec,

05:58.034 --> 06:00.034
and I convinced her
that it would be a great novel,

06:00.103 --> 06:01.379
which it would.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.206
It's sexy

06:03.275 --> 06:04.448
and it's millennial

06:04.517 --> 06:05.827
and it's set
in the fashion world.

06:05.896 --> 06:07.724
It's perfect.
And if we publish it now,

06:07.793 --> 06:09.137
before the movie comes out,

06:09.206 --> 06:11.379
Reese is gonna be promoting
the hell out of it.

06:11.448 --> 06:13.517
- Reverse-engineer a novel
from a screenplay.

06:13.586 --> 06:15.137
- Yes.
- But that takes time.

06:15.206 --> 06:17.068
We need a writer.
- We have one.

06:17.137 --> 06:18.172
The screenwriter.

06:18.241 --> 06:20.000
She's already written
a sample chapter

06:20.068 --> 06:21.103
and it's great.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.517
We can have this thing out
in a month.

06:22.586 --> 06:23.896
And how can Quinn say no?

06:23.965 --> 06:25.862
She loves Reese.
Everybody loves Reese.

06:25.931 --> 06:28.172
I can bump Quinn's book,
look like a hero,

06:28.241 --> 06:29.931
and keep my job.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.655
- She wouldn't fire you for
making a hard decision, Kelsey.

06:32.724 --> 06:34.344
- Well, now we never
have to find out.

06:34.413 --> 06:35.620
What are you waiting for?

06:35.689 --> 06:37.172
Read. Read, read, read.
Before tonight.

06:37.241 --> 06:38.689
- Okay.

06:52.241 --> 06:53.448
- Wow.

06:53.517 --> 06:55.689
Waiting for a drink
like the rest of us?

06:55.758 --> 06:56.758
Don't you host
committee members

06:56.827 --> 06:58.758
have a private room
somewhere?

06:58.827 --> 07:01.241
- I didn't even know I was
co-hosting this event.

07:01.310 --> 07:02.655
Everybody on that list

07:02.724 --> 07:04.620
has been in publishing
forever.

07:04.689 --> 07:06.689
I do not belong here.

07:06.758 --> 07:08.034
- You're standing
in front of a bar.

07:08.103 --> 07:10.448
You never belonged anywhere
more in your life.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.137
Here, have mine.

07:15.586 --> 07:17.344
- Wow, tough day.

07:17.413 --> 07:19.275
- Tough week.

07:19.344 --> 07:21.034
But a good day.

07:21.103 --> 07:23.517
I had a little breakthrough
at work.

07:23.586 --> 07:25.379
And it's nice to see
a friendly face.

07:25.448 --> 07:27.931
- Actually, that's what
I want to talk to you about.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.482
I don't wanna be friends
with you anymore.

07:29.551 --> 07:32.241
It's, uh, too difficult.

07:32.310 --> 07:34.965
- Because I have a job
and you're not working?

07:35.034 --> 07:36.689
That is so--

07:38.896 --> 07:41.241
Not... friends.

07:41.310 --> 07:42.241
You mean...

07:42.310 --> 07:43.241
- I mean...

07:46.620 --> 07:50.068
- Oh, my God,
you got a job.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.413
- Let's just say
things are looking up.

07:56.103 --> 07:58.379
- Our first time out
as a couple.

07:58.448 --> 08:01.275
- I feel a little
Eliza Doolittle-y at the moment.

08:01.344 --> 08:04.896
- Too bad Professor Higgins
still has to pretend you're 28.

08:04.965 --> 08:07.206
- I know,
it's not what we planned.

08:10.931 --> 08:12.448
- Diva, Enzo, hi.

08:12.517 --> 08:14.448
Okay, oh, my God, I was just
schmoozing the editor

08:14.517 --> 08:16.827
of "Modern Romance"--
yes, the "Modern Romance,"

08:16.896 --> 08:19.758
and I think we should
submit your story.

08:19.827 --> 08:21.413
- What--what story?

08:21.482 --> 08:23.172
- Your love story, come on.

08:23.241 --> 08:25.827
The photo of you two embracing,
fresh out of the sewer,

08:25.896 --> 08:27.758
dripping with America's
digested bounty.

08:27.827 --> 08:29.000
It's gone viral.

08:29.068 --> 08:30.551
It's a story as old as time

08:30.620 --> 08:32.310
but fresh as this
morning's flush.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.172
- Wait, the paper would run
our story?

08:34.241 --> 08:35.103
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:35.172 --> 08:36.137
It's just like Romeo and Juliet,

08:36.206 --> 08:37.689
if Romeo smelled a little bit

08:37.758 --> 08:39.655
and there was poop
in Juliet's ear.

08:39.724 --> 08:41.931
- Absolutely not.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.689
We are not doing that.

08:50.379 --> 08:53.758
- What's that all about?

08:53.827 --> 08:56.620
- Diana is giving us
the cold shoulder.

08:56.689 --> 08:58.931
- She's still prickly
about me and you.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.034
I think she's hurt
I didn't confide in her.

09:03.103 --> 09:05.379
- You're taking some bullets
meant for me.

09:05.448 --> 09:08.931
Come on,
I should've done this sooner.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.827
Hello, Charles, Liza.

09:13.896 --> 09:16.379
You remember Enzo?

09:16.448 --> 09:18.241
Having, uh, fun?

09:18.310 --> 09:19.620
- Diana,
you and I both know

09:19.689 --> 09:22.172
that I owe you an apology.

09:22.241 --> 09:25.482
- Well, uh, if pressed,
some might say

09:25.551 --> 09:28.379
that leaving a place
we worked together for 20 years

09:28.448 --> 09:30.103
without a word,
and carrying on an affair

09:30.172 --> 09:31.758
with my assistant
right under my nose,

09:31.827 --> 09:36.241
could merit
some form of apology.

09:37.758 --> 09:42.413
- I can't apologize
for falling in love with Liza.

09:42.482 --> 09:45.034
But you are right.

09:45.103 --> 09:46.551
You should've been
the first person I told

09:46.620 --> 09:48.655
that I was leaving.

09:48.724 --> 09:50.896
You have been by my side,

09:50.965 --> 09:52.862
making tough decisions with me,

09:52.931 --> 09:55.172
and I owed you that,

09:55.241 --> 09:57.517
and more.

09:57.586 --> 09:59.482
- Charles.

09:59.551 --> 10:01.896
I guess I just
always hoped

10:01.965 --> 10:05.241
that maybe one day
you and I...

10:05.310 --> 10:06.965
Would run the company
together.

10:07.034 --> 10:08.517
So.

10:08.586 --> 10:11.241
- Well, unfortunately,
Quinn wanted a millennial

10:11.310 --> 10:12.793
as the face
of the company.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.206
- Oh, so it wasn't
your decision?

10:15.275 --> 10:16.689
- Uh, no.

10:16.758 --> 10:18.655
- So what I'm hearing
is that if it were up to you,

10:18.724 --> 10:20.310
I'd be running Millennial.

10:20.379 --> 10:21.862
- That's not exactly
what I was saying.

10:21.931 --> 10:23.103
- Well, that's what I heard,

10:23.172 --> 10:24.862
so why don't we just
leave it at that?

10:24.931 --> 10:26.827
It's so good to be on
the same page, Charles.

10:26.896 --> 10:28.551
Like it's always been.

10:30.448 --> 10:33.000
Do I see a dance floor
over there?

10:33.068 --> 10:34.517
Have fun, you two.

10:37.862 --> 10:40.448
- She seems better.

10:40.517 --> 10:42.689
- Is that what you think?

10:42.758 --> 10:44.551
About Kelsey only
getting the job

10:44.620 --> 10:45.793
because she's
a millennial?

10:45.862 --> 10:48.724
- No.
Of course not.

10:48.793 --> 10:51.275
She is capable
and smart.

10:51.344 --> 10:54.793
I knew that years ago
when I gave her the imprint.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.655
If anything,
her youth is against her.

10:57.724 --> 10:58.862
- What does that mean?

10:58.931 --> 11:01.172
- Experience means something.

11:01.241 --> 11:03.172
Kelsey will do
a great job.

11:03.241 --> 11:05.827
She'll get there.
- She's already there.

11:05.896 --> 11:08.275
You should've seen
her today.

11:08.344 --> 11:10.586
Quinn's book isn't ready
and she's pressuring us

11:10.655 --> 11:12.068
to make "CLAW"
our first release.

11:12.137 --> 11:14.000
But Kelsey came up
with a plan to block her

11:14.068 --> 11:15.793
with a project
from Reese's company.

11:15.862 --> 11:18.172
It was great thinking,
on the spot.

11:18.241 --> 11:22.310
You would've been
so proud of her.

11:22.379 --> 11:24.068
What?

11:24.137 --> 11:25.413
- I would've done it
differently.

11:25.482 --> 11:27.862
Any time there
is a regime change,

11:27.931 --> 11:29.655
you take out
the trash first.

11:29.724 --> 11:31.862
If it bombs,
it doesn't hurt you.

11:31.931 --> 11:34.448
They blame the old regime.

11:34.517 --> 11:38.448
Second book is bad?
That'll stick to you.

11:40.448 --> 11:46.206
But you know what?
Maybe it'll work.

11:46.275 --> 11:47.724
We good?

11:50.344 --> 11:52.344
- We're good.

11:52.413 --> 11:54.172
- Charles as good as said
he'd pick me.

11:54.241 --> 11:56.379
I knew it, I knew it.
We have this--this connection.

11:56.448 --> 11:59.275
We're like two bodies,
one mind.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.413
- That doesn't sound
like quite enough mind.

12:01.482 --> 12:03.827
Life is funny, isn't it?

12:03.896 --> 12:04.896
I mean, he's the guy
I always thought

12:04.965 --> 12:07.103
I'd end up with.
It's ironic.

12:07.172 --> 12:08.586
- You had a crush
on Charles?

12:08.655 --> 12:10.965
I'm just saying life is funny.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.344
You know?
I--I always thought

12:12.413 --> 12:13.965
I'd end up with
someone like him.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.482
Cultured, sophisticated,
man of the world,

12:16.551 --> 12:17.931
you know...

12:18.000 --> 12:22.034
Life had other plans.
And I'm with you.

12:25.655 --> 12:26.793
What?

12:26.862 --> 12:28.517
- I'm just...

12:28.586 --> 12:30.965
I'm never gonna
be enough for you, am I?

12:31.034 --> 12:32.379
And even if I were,

12:32.448 --> 12:33.931
you're in love
with someone else.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.379
- Enzo, come on,
I'm just saying

12:35.448 --> 12:37.793
that I'm a realist,
not a romantic.

12:37.862 --> 12:38.896
- No.

12:38.965 --> 12:42.413
No, what you're
saying is...

12:42.482 --> 12:44.379
you're settling.

12:44.448 --> 12:45.586
And you know what?

12:45.655 --> 12:47.379
Maybe I am too.

12:47.448 --> 12:49.896
For someone who is just taking
what she could get.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.034
- But--Enzo, I--

12:56.103 --> 12:57.862
- Good night, Diana.

13:07.793 --> 13:09.344
- Knock-knock. Hi.

13:09.413 --> 13:11.172
I'm here to do your kills
from the publicity photos

13:11.241 --> 13:13.034
at the literacy event
last night.

13:13.103 --> 13:15.551
Uh, let's see.
Kill, kill.

13:15.620 --> 13:16.724
Ooh, little pooch there.

13:16.793 --> 13:18.551
Ooh, neck, no.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.103
Oh, my God,

13:20.172 --> 13:23.103
Enzo looks gorge
in a tux, though!

13:23.172 --> 13:24.827
I mean you guys
really are the couple.

13:24.896 --> 13:26.862
Look at that.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.517
- We were, perhaps.

13:31.068 --> 13:32.241
We're not together
anymore.

13:32.310 --> 13:34.965
- Oh, my God, Diana,
that is awful.

13:35.034 --> 13:37.172
I mean--no I mean
it's awful that, um,

13:37.241 --> 13:38.862
everyone thinks they gotta be
boo'd up all the time.

13:38.931 --> 13:41.103
You know, at least you and I
can do the bars now together.

13:41.172 --> 13:42.448
Once I edit your look.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.517
Ooh, I better call
the paper

13:44.586 --> 13:46.103
and kill
the "Modern Romance" story.

13:46.172 --> 13:47.689
- I thought I told you
I didn't want to do that.

13:47.758 --> 13:50.379
I will call them myself.

13:50.448 --> 13:52.448
- Okay, great.

14:06.482 --> 14:08.344
- What does that mean,
"taking out the trash?"

14:08.413 --> 14:09.965
- Well, there's
something to be said

14:10.034 --> 14:12.068
for pushing "CLAW"
out now and moving on.

14:12.137 --> 14:14.137
And Charles says
we can blame him for it.

14:14.206 --> 14:16.068
And it won't stick to us.

14:16.137 --> 14:19.241
- Wait, you discussed this
with Charles?

14:19.310 --> 14:22.241
So you're running
my decisions past him?

14:22.310 --> 14:24.482
- No, I was just talking
about our day

14:24.551 --> 14:26.758
and how Quinn can be
so tricky to handle and--

14:26.827 --> 14:28.620
- And how
I'm out of my depth?

14:28.689 --> 14:30.241
That's what you think.

14:30.310 --> 14:31.724
I mean you
and I both know

14:31.793 --> 14:33.551
that I choked at dinner
with Quinn the other night.

14:33.620 --> 14:35.344
- Well, I wasn't strong
enough with her either.

14:35.413 --> 14:37.275
She walked all over me
with the edits.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.206
- So I'm not
strong enough?

14:39.275 --> 14:42.137
Well, lucky for me,
you two just gave me

14:42.206 --> 14:43.551
all the strength
that I need.

14:43.620 --> 14:45.965
- Kelsey.
- Set up a dinner with Quinn.

14:46.034 --> 14:47.655
Just her and me.

14:47.724 --> 14:49.586
That's all.

14:53.862 --> 14:55.517
- You can't push my book
to the spring.

14:55.586 --> 14:57.448
It's tied to my campaign.

14:57.517 --> 14:58.655
- I'm sorry, what?

14:58.724 --> 15:00.517
- Look, between
you and me,

15:00.586 --> 15:01.793
I'm running for Senate.

15:01.862 --> 15:02.965
California.

15:03.034 --> 15:04.310
I wish you were registered
there.

15:04.379 --> 15:05.724
Maybe we can arrange that.

15:05.793 --> 15:08.620
Okay, anyway, "CLAW"
is going to introduce me,

15:08.689 --> 15:12.482
and soon, as a strong,
independent voice.

15:12.551 --> 15:13.965
- Wow.

15:14.034 --> 15:16.275
Congratulations, Quinn.
- Thank you.

15:16.344 --> 15:18.137
- But that doesn't concern me.

15:18.206 --> 15:20.068
I have a campaign too,

15:20.137 --> 15:21.620
and that is to make sure
that every book

15:21.689 --> 15:23.758
that comes out of Millennial
is the best

15:23.827 --> 15:25.517
that it can possibly be.

15:25.586 --> 15:27.172
And frankly,
"CLAW" isn't there.

15:27.241 --> 15:28.931
- That's my decision

15:29.000 --> 15:30.586
and I'm afraid it's final.

15:30.655 --> 15:32.000
- I admire that.

15:32.068 --> 15:33.689
Speaking your truth
to power.

15:33.758 --> 15:36.413
Even if power still wins.

15:36.482 --> 15:38.689
- You have a seat
on the board, Quinn.

15:38.758 --> 15:41.034
Board members don't tell
publishers what to do.

15:41.103 --> 15:42.724
- Oh, Kelsey.

15:42.793 --> 15:43.965
Don't make an enemy so soon

15:44.034 --> 15:46.620
in what could be
a very long career.

15:48.931 --> 15:50.827
Okay.

15:50.896 --> 15:52.758
Publish "CLAW" now,

15:52.827 --> 15:55.517
and if it's a flop, like
you think it's going to be,

15:55.586 --> 15:59.413
you will never
hear from me again.

15:59.482 --> 16:01.172
But it's gonna
be a big hit.

16:01.241 --> 16:03.344
- I don't think it will be.

16:03.413 --> 16:05.931
- Look, this is a win-win
for you, Kelsey.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.517
If you just get your ego
out of the way.

16:07.586 --> 16:10.862
If it fails, I will be
out of your life forever.

16:10.931 --> 16:12.172
If it's a hit...

16:12.241 --> 16:13.965
You're gonna look like
a genius publisher

16:14.034 --> 16:15.655
from day one.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.448
That's a good deal.

16:19.206 --> 16:21.655
- You're a writer, Quinn.

16:21.724 --> 16:23.344
Put it in writing.

16:23.413 --> 16:26.862
If "CLAW" fails, you go.

16:26.931 --> 16:29.862
- Baller move.

16:29.931 --> 16:31.413
I like you, Kelsey.

16:31.482 --> 16:33.931
- Awesome.

16:36.482 --> 16:38.793
- You've become
quite the chef.

16:38.862 --> 16:41.344
- Oh, yeah,
I really, uh--

16:41.413 --> 16:43.206
Mastered the Postmates app.

16:44.344 --> 16:45.655
- I think I might wanna

16:45.724 --> 16:48.862
branch out
to other cuisines, though.

16:48.931 --> 16:50.793
Seamless.

16:50.862 --> 16:53.620
Uber Eats.

16:53.689 --> 16:55.137
- How did work go today?

16:55.206 --> 16:59.068
What did you guys decide to do
with Quinn's book?

16:59.137 --> 17:00.896
- Actually, Charles,

17:00.965 --> 17:02.379
I don't think
it's a good idea

17:02.448 --> 17:04.965
for us to talk
about Millennial.

17:05.034 --> 17:09.103
I don't want Kelsey thinking
I'm back-channeling with you.

17:09.172 --> 17:11.206
We need a--
what's it called?

17:11.275 --> 17:13.689
A Chinese wall
between us.

17:16.137 --> 17:17.965
- You're right.

17:18.034 --> 17:19.310
I'm sorry.

17:19.379 --> 17:22.034
Uh, you don't tell me
about your day

17:22.103 --> 17:23.586
and I won't tell
you about my day.

17:23.655 --> 17:27.206
So don't ask for details
about the kids' movie tomorrow.

17:27.275 --> 17:29.896
Apparently there,
um, is...

17:29.965 --> 17:32.137
a puppy and a mermaid,

17:32.206 --> 17:33.862
and they both--

17:33.931 --> 17:36.172
- Get lost in space.

17:36.241 --> 17:38.482
That's all you get.

17:38.551 --> 17:41.413
- Well, that's not
all you get.

17:56.655 --> 18:00.827
- ♪ Falling in love
completely... ♪

18:02.482 --> 18:04.310
- Hi, welcome.
Signature cocktail?

18:04.379 --> 18:05.724
It's an Epidura-tini.

18:05.793 --> 18:08.206
Smooth as a spinal block,
but with lime.

18:08.275 --> 18:09.965
- Ah, fabulous.

18:10.034 --> 18:11.620
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

18:11.689 --> 18:12.689
Enjoy.

18:20.379 --> 18:21.620
- Peace offering.

18:21.689 --> 18:23.482
I laid down
some ground rules.

18:23.551 --> 18:24.689
I won't talk about
the business

18:24.758 --> 18:26.620
when I'm with him
and he won't ask.

18:26.689 --> 18:28.103
- That's good.

18:28.172 --> 18:29.931
But we're still gonna
publish Quinn's book first.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.379
I can't fight
with her and Charles.

18:32.448 --> 18:33.931
And I don't want
to fight with you.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.137
- Well, if you fight with me,
I'm on your side,

18:36.206 --> 18:38.448
so I'll take me down.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.379
Come on, you survived
your first week.

18:40.448 --> 18:42.551
Let's celebrate!
- Okay.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.137
- Oh!

18:44.206 --> 18:46.551
- Ladies and gentlemen
and non-binaries.

18:46.620 --> 18:48.586
Hi, can I have
your attention, please?

18:48.655 --> 18:50.793
Okay, the sealed envelope
from the doctor

18:50.862 --> 18:52.896
has gone to the balloon company
and they filled

18:52.965 --> 18:54.241
that gold balloon on top

18:54.310 --> 18:56.965
with either pink confetti
or blue.

18:57.034 --> 18:59.172
Okay, now, Josh,
as the male,

18:59.241 --> 19:01.448
you have the honor
of penetrating

19:01.517 --> 19:03.586
the yielding softness
of that balloon

19:03.655 --> 19:06.275
with your golden phallus.

19:06.344 --> 19:08.344
I.e., this safety pin
right here, okay?

19:08.413 --> 19:10.551
So, Liza,
get the balloons, please.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.241
- Please gather.

19:12.310 --> 19:14.310
All right, let's do this
in T-minus ten,

19:14.379 --> 19:15.448
nine...

19:15.517 --> 19:18.517
all: Eight, seven, six...

19:18.586 --> 19:19.931
- Let me help you.
- Wait, wait, wait.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.724
It's just trapped.
- Oh, I got it.

19:22.896 --> 19:25.241
- Oh, my God, no!
- No, no, no, no.

19:25.310 --> 19:26.793
- No!
- Come back.

19:26.862 --> 19:28.620
- I am so sorry, can we call
the balloon company?

19:28.689 --> 19:30.896
You don't wanna have
to wait two weeks, do you?

19:30.965 --> 19:32.172
-  Uh, guys.

19:32.241 --> 19:33.758
I don't think
I'm gonna have to.

19:33.827 --> 19:34.689
-  What?

19:34.758 --> 19:36.379
- I think the baby's coming.

19:36.448 --> 19:37.620
- Now?
- Now.

19:37.689 --> 19:39.344
Now, I mean like, right now.

19:39.413 --> 19:40.793
- Oh, my God!

19:40.862 --> 19:42.482
Uh, okay, will somebody
please call a car?

19:42.551 --> 19:43.896
- Two minutes!
Yes.

19:46.689 --> 19:48.000
- Three more minutes,

19:48.068 --> 19:49.413
just hang on.

19:49.482 --> 19:51.206
- Shouldn't somebody else
be in the splash zone?

19:51.275 --> 19:52.724
- Maggie.

19:52.793 --> 19:54.517
You and I are the only two
women on the planet

19:54.586 --> 19:56.448
who've been
inside my mother.

19:56.517 --> 19:57.758
We're bonded!

19:57.827 --> 19:59.448
- Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

19:59.517 --> 20:00.896
Oh, my God,
it's coming for me.

20:00.965 --> 20:02.379
- Hey, hey, hey,
remember your breathing?

20:02.448 --> 20:04.413
Right, deep breaths.
- Not helping.

20:04.482 --> 20:05.758
- I need to push.

20:05.827 --> 20:06.965
both: No, don't push!
- Do not push.

20:07.034 --> 20:08.517
- No baby in my Uber!

20:08.586 --> 20:10.068
- Too late.

20:10.137 --> 20:11.241
-  Oh, wow!

20:11.310 --> 20:13.000
- There goes
my five-star rating.

20:21.034 --> 20:22.793
- Yo, Enzo.

20:22.862 --> 20:24.034
You see this?

20:24.103 --> 20:25.551
There's that picture again.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.931
And some article about love.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.172
- Get out of here.

20:29.241 --> 20:30.241
The hell am I
paying you for?

20:30.310 --> 20:31.724
- Okay, loverboy.

20:31.793 --> 20:34.896
- "Flush With Love"?
What the--

20:34.965 --> 20:38.896
"Dreams we have as a child,
dreams we pack..."

20:38.965 --> 20:40.793
- ...in a box for college.

20:40.862 --> 20:42.379
Dreams you unpack
when you move

20:42.448 --> 20:43.758
into your first apartment.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.034
Who you'll meet,
where you'll work,

20:46.103 --> 20:47.827
who you'll fall in love with.

20:47.896 --> 20:51.931
Think you have it all
figured out?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.586
Life has better ideas.

20:54.655 --> 20:57.586
A bigger imagination
takes bigger chances

20:57.655 --> 21:00.448
than someone
like me, a year ago.

21:00.517 --> 21:04.000
Moving through her forties
in a cloud of old ideas.

21:06.517 --> 21:09.448
Life gives you more
than you thought,

21:09.517 --> 21:12.689
but maybe not
in the package you expected.

21:12.758 --> 21:14.206
- Liza.

21:14.275 --> 21:17.862

21:17.931 --> 21:21.758

21:21.827 --> 21:24.000
♪ If you call out,

21:24.068 --> 21:25.931
- It's deeper than that.

21:28.172 --> 21:31.241
It's what you need
underneath the want.

21:33.965 --> 21:36.931
It gives you what
you can't breathe without.

21:40.896 --> 21:42.965
- Did you mean this?

21:45.103 --> 21:47.517
- Yes.
- Even this part?

21:47.586 --> 21:50.034
Where you say you're not looking
for the man of your dreams?

21:50.103 --> 21:52.241
That what you care about now
is the man at night

21:52.310 --> 21:54.137
sleeping next to you,
dreaming?

21:54.206 --> 21:57.103
- Yes.

21:57.172 --> 22:00.793
I mean it.

22:00.862 --> 22:03.034
Every word.

22:07.310 --> 22:08.482
Get over here.

22:08.551 --> 22:10.344
- You get over here.

22:15.655 --> 22:18.034
So go ahead and plan.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.758
Just know,
when all your scheming

22:20.827 --> 22:24.310
and planning,
and hoping is done,

22:24.379 --> 22:27.758
life plans back.

22:27.827 --> 22:30.379
- Hi.

22:30.448 --> 22:31.517
Everything okay?

22:31.586 --> 22:34.034
- Yeah.
Baby girl.

22:34.103 --> 22:36.344
- Hmm.
- They're happy.

22:36.413 --> 22:38.965
- Good for them.

22:39.034 --> 22:40.793
Me too.

22:42.034 --> 22:43.758
You?

22:43.827 --> 22:46.172

22:46.241 --> 22:47.965
Me too.
