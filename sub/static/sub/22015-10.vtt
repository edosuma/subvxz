WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:06.407
.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.275
- In the
criminal justice system,

00:09.477 --> 00:11.479
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.182
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.215 --> 00:15.649
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:15.683 --> 00:17.251
are members of an elite squad

00:17.285 --> 00:19.320
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.222
These are their stories.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.463
He's my blood.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.599
He will never be a part of you

00:31.632 --> 00:33.234
the way he is a part of me.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.769
- Grandma, Grandma!

00:35.803 --> 00:37.405
- Hey, mama's here, sweet boy.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.807
Mama's here, you're okay.
- Grandma Sheila.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.642
I saw her.
- Oh, honey.

00:41.675 --> 00:44.845
You just had a dream, okay?
But mama's here with you now.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.747
- Noah.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.349
You know how
we talked about you

00:48.382 --> 00:50.284
sleeping in your own bed
all night, remember?

00:50.318 --> 00:52.086
- Please, mama,
please, mama, please, mama.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.622
- Okay, okay, okay.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.590
One more night, okay?

00:59.193 --> 01:01.429
- Eddie wants
to sleep with us too.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.731
- Of course, it wouldn't
be a proper slumber party

01:03.764 --> 01:05.166
without Eddie.

01:05.199 --> 01:08.569
- Grandma Sheila,
is she all right?

01:08.602 --> 01:12.540
- Yes, honey, of course.
- I want to see her.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.844
- Okay, now let's
go to bed, honey.

01:16.877 --> 01:20.080
Let's go to bed.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.850
- This morning,
we're going to continue

01:22.883 --> 01:24.252
with ecosystems.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.519
Now who remembers
what ecology is?

01:25.553 --> 01:27.221
- I know, I know!
- How organisms

01:27.255 --> 01:28.789
act to each other
in their environments.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.859
- Good, Taylor, but next time,
wait till I call on you.

01:31.892 --> 01:35.329
Now organisms are...Mariel?

01:35.363 --> 01:37.198
- Any living thing.

01:37.231 --> 01:40.334
- Yes, and living things
interact in different ways.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.803
Now some can cooperate,
like ants building a nest.

01:42.836 --> 01:46.840
And others prey on each other.
So who can give me an example?

01:46.874 --> 01:48.809
- The tick is
sucking the dog's blood.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.911
It means the tick
is a parasite.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.182
- Yeah...

01:54.215 --> 01:57.885
- I'm on a new medicine,
it's making me sleepy.

01:57.918 --> 02:00.621
- Oh, okay.
- I'll be fine.

02:00.654 --> 02:04.492
- Okay, clean up, everyone.
Snack time.

02:04.525 --> 02:08.262
- I'm sorry I spilled juice.
- No worries, accidents happen.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.931
Let's just get
some paper towels.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.437
- Oh, my God, Cody!

02:16.470 --> 02:19.139
Go find Principal Flock, now!

02:21.242 --> 02:24.478
- Mariel McLaughlin is 15,
has MD, epilepsy,

02:24.512 --> 02:27.715
and some learning issues.
Cody Hill is 19, has autism.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.450
- And you said a teacher
found them together?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.552
- On the floor
of a supply closet.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.254
We don't really know
what was happening,

02:33.287 --> 02:34.355
but we do have
mandated reporting.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.923
- You did the right thing.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.326
- This is Mariel and Cody's
teacher, Vanessa Banks.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.593
- They should
have been supervised,

02:39.627 --> 02:41.429
I don't know how
they slipped away.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.397
- Not really.

02:43.431 --> 02:44.932
They were both pretty upset.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.534
So I thought it best
to separate them.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.936
- Their parents are on the way.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.938
Obviously we don't want
legal action.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.540
- Mariel is underage.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.408
- Well they have
impaired social interaction.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.277
They're very
sheltered, immature.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.446
- Okay, we'll talk to them.
We'll sort it out.

03:00.581 --> 03:04.218
- Oh, no, honey.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.320
I just need to figure out
what happened

03:06.354 --> 03:09.757
between you and Cody.
- Oh, my God, Mariel.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.592
- Detective Rollins, SVU.

03:11.625 --> 03:15.296
- We had to, Mrs. McLaughlin.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.932
Mariel, are you all right?

03:18.966 --> 03:20.301
What happened?

03:20.334 --> 03:23.604
- Mommy, Cody raped me.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.243
- Oh, my God, sweetie.
- Okay.

03:35.949 --> 03:43.357
*

04:19.793 --> 04:20.294
.

04:20.328 --> 04:21.161
- I'm sure my son
didn't do anything wrong.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.365
Tell the police officer, Cody.

04:24.398 --> 04:27.335
- Can you tell me
how you and uh...

04:27.368 --> 04:29.603
And Mariel ended up
alone in the supply room?

04:29.637 --> 04:31.372
- I told the cafeteria monitor

04:31.405 --> 04:33.741
that Mariel
left her sweater in class.

04:33.774 --> 04:34.975
And I wheeled her out.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.710
- Okay, and when
you were alone,

04:36.744 --> 04:38.045
what did you do?

04:38.078 --> 04:39.747
- I helped her
out of the wheelchair.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.617
We laid down on the floor,
then we had sex.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.919
- It's okay.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.521
Mariel's the Little Mermaid,

04:47.555 --> 04:49.590
because she can't
use her legs so good.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.525
And I'm her prince, Eric.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.594
- That's his favorite movie.

04:53.627 --> 04:56.697
Look, this is just
kids being kids.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.966
My son doesn't even fully
understand what sex is.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.368
- Yeah, I do.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.002
You put your penis
inside the girl.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.472
It means you're in love.

05:06.374 --> 05:09.410
- Yeah.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.780
- I don't know what to say.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.915
This is a discipline issue,
not a police matter.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.517
- It might be, Mr. Hill.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.552
- Did Mariel's mother
make a complaint?

05:18.586 --> 05:20.821
Overprotective is
putting it mildly.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.056
- It's not up to her.
Mariel's underage.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.658
We need to bring
Cody to the station,

05:24.692 --> 05:27.828
get a statement.
We'll talk to the ADA.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.700
- Cody helped me
out of my chair.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.835
I can walk,
but it's hard for me.

05:34.868 --> 05:37.705
- She has
muscle weakness, atrophy.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.707
- Oh, I see.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.775
Mariel, then what happened?

05:41.809 --> 05:45.112
- I took my sweater off.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.680
We took our pants off.

05:46.714 --> 05:49.450
- Mariel, you said
you were raped.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.118
Did Cody force you
to do something

05:51.151 --> 05:52.720
that you didn't want to?

05:52.753 --> 05:56.424
- No, we're in love.
We're getting married.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.561
- Sorry, do you know
what rape means, Mariel?

06:00.594 --> 06:02.430
- Yes, when a boy
puts his penis

06:02.463 --> 06:04.732
on your vagina.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.602
I heard one of the aides
talking about it.

06:08.636 --> 06:11.605
- Yes.

06:11.639 --> 06:15.743
- Okay, and did you say no,
or that you didn't want it?

06:15.776 --> 06:17.711
- No.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.680
I liked it.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.050
Like we were real grown-ups.
- Mariel, honey.

06:23.083 --> 06:25.753
Um, give us a minute, okay?

06:25.786 --> 06:27.688
Can I just...

06:29.690 --> 06:31.792
I...I don't know
what's going on,

06:31.825 --> 06:33.461
but I should
get my daughter home.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.763
She's--she's not well,
she has anxiety issues.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.898
- Well, I understand,
but we need

06:37.931 --> 06:39.667
to get Mariel to a hospital.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.834
- Yeah, for a rape kit.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.803
She needs to be
tested for STDs,

06:42.836 --> 06:45.138
just to make sure she's okay.
- We'll go to her pediatrician.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.775
- And you're more than welcome
to call her doctor, of course,

06:47.808 --> 06:50.744
but she really needs
to be seen by somebody

06:50.778 --> 06:53.581
with experience
in these kinds of cases, okay?

06:54.515 --> 06:56.650
Mariel.

06:56.684 --> 06:59.520
- And autistic.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.522
- And she's 15
and says he raped her?

07:01.555 --> 07:03.691
- Rollins doesn't think she
understood what the word meant.

07:03.724 --> 07:07.595
I get the sense this is a
Romeo and Juliet scenario here.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.530
Should we call Liv?
- No, we don't call Liv.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.032
She's still on leave.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.568
- We take his statement,
then we wait on the rape kit.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.837
Take it to Barba, figure out
if we've got a crime.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.507
- Yeah, I'm cool.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.079
- Well, how invasive
is this procedure?

07:26.113 --> 07:27.581
- The nurse will
take some swabs,

07:27.615 --> 07:29.483
and some photographs.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.951
- Dr. Levy,
thank God you're here.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.820
- Hi.
- Hey, Detective Rollins, SVU.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.188
- Alexandra Levy,
Mariel's pediatrician.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.257
- Mariel's right here.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.560
- I'm okay.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.929
- She's really nervous.
- We can sedate her.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.098
- Likely ketamine,
10 milligrams.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.767
- The IV has to be
in her right arm.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.837
She's got phlebitis in the--
- I remember, Dawn.

07:49.870 --> 07:53.807
Mariel, can I take your vitals?
Excuse me.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.717
It's just seeing her like this.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.586
She puts on
a brave face for me,

08:05.619 --> 08:07.254
but it never
gets any easier.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.922
- What, may I ask,
is her condition?

08:08.956 --> 08:10.991
- She was diagnosed
with muscular dystrophy

08:11.024 --> 08:12.726
when she was four.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.897
That put her in the wheelchair,
and then epilepsy.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.566
Blood cancer, twice.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.668
- Sounds like a rough road.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.135
- Well, like they say,

08:22.169 --> 08:25.839
the lord never gives you
more than you can handle.

08:27.875 --> 08:31.278
Can I just see
what the numbers are?

08:31.311 --> 08:33.781
- Oh!
- War!

08:33.814 --> 08:38.719
both: I-de-clare-war!

08:38.752 --> 08:41.221
- You got me again!
I surrender, I surrender.

08:43.123 --> 08:46.326
- I thought you said no work.
- It's Amanda, I'll be quick.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.195
Hey.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.163
You're where?

08:50.197 --> 08:54.134
Uh, no, I'm coming right now.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.171
Hi.
- Hey, sorry.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.574
I hope this isn't a bad time.
- No, come on in.

09:00.608 --> 09:04.144
I'm just getting beat
at cards again.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.113
- I'm great.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.882
- So, Noah, how about you
change into your PJs, right?

09:08.916 --> 09:10.317
And I'm going to talk
to Amanda for a second.

09:10.350 --> 09:13.721
I'll be super quick.
- He seems good.

09:13.754 --> 09:17.057
- Yeah, he is.
We're getting there.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.359
He still wants
to sleep in the bed with me.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.629
And I'm letting him,
so I don't know if that's

09:21.662 --> 09:24.097
for him or for me.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.666
- I hear you.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.334
- So, you guys
managing without me?

09:27.367 --> 09:30.037
- Yeah, and Fin loves being
in charge, I can tell you that.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.973
Okay.

09:33.006 --> 09:35.375
You got a file?
- Yeah.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.944
I just wanted you
to go over this.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.813
Just make sure we're
not missing something.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.882
- Okay.

09:43.183 --> 09:46.754
15, 19, both have disabilities.
She's in a wheelchair?

09:46.787 --> 09:48.255
- Yeah, but she's
not paralyzed.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.924
And the rape kit came back
negative for trauma, semen.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.293
So whatever they did, it seems
like it was consensual.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.096
- He doesn't want to pursue.

09:56.129 --> 09:57.865
- Okay.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.835
But there's something else.
- Yeah.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.972
Yeah it's...
it's the girl's mother.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.074
You know Jesse
had a fever last week, right?

10:07.107 --> 10:10.177
And of course I was concerned,
but I didn't rush to the ER.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.279
And you know, I've seen
you when Noah's sick.

10:12.312 --> 10:13.981
It's just... I don't know.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.849
Granted, this mother's
been through a lot.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.418
But--
- You think there's an issue.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.921
I'm not sure.

10:20.954 --> 10:25.092
But I had Warner
check Mariel's tox screen.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.295
- Well, if she's incapacitated,
then that's a different story.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.763
- Yeah.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.099
Anyway, I'll find out.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.400
- Well, keep me posted.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.002
I mean, I'm supposed
to be off-duty,

10:35.035 --> 10:37.037
but I'm just here
playing cards.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.674
- I'm ready for bed!
- Wow, that was fast.

10:40.708 --> 10:41.875
- All right, see you guys.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.944
- Say bye. Bye-bye!
- Bye!

10:43.977 --> 10:46.113
- All right, keep me posted.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.118
- You made
the right call, Amanda.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.253
- You could say that.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.155
She had half a pharmacy
in her system.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.724
- But she is sick.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.091
And a lot of
these drugs make sense.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.760
Like the Valproate,
for seizures.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.895
- She also had a cocktail

11:01.929 --> 11:04.932
of others.
Paxil, St. John's Wort, Ginko.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.801
And some of these have
severe adverse interactions

11:07.835 --> 11:09.770
with the
anti-seizure medication.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.138
- Could that
just be an oversight?

11:11.171 --> 11:13.406
- Not by any
reputable professional.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.075
If this was purposeful,

11:15.108 --> 11:17.210
I'd say you're looking
at medical malpractice.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.479
And possibly a case
of child abuse.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.853
*

11:29.356 --> 11:29.723
.

11:29.757 --> 11:30.590
- Yeah!

11:32.325 --> 11:34.161
- Oh, my God, this is
the best birthday ever!

11:34.194 --> 11:36.329
Ever, ever!
- Whoo-hoo!

11:36.363 --> 11:39.032
Yay, we're going to--

11:40.267 --> 11:42.469
People have been so generous.

11:42.502 --> 11:45.105
Mariel loved Disney World.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.740
- She's lucky she's
got so much support.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.508
- People just respond
to her, you know?

11:48.541 --> 11:50.310
How brave she is.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.747
Now, you said you
were here about Cody?

11:53.781 --> 11:55.348
- Uh, yeah.
We wanted to let you know

11:55.382 --> 11:58.485
that the ADA
is not going to press charges.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.253
- Oh...

12:00.287 --> 12:02.255
Well, that's probably
for the best.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.828
Why are they here?
Detective Rollins?

12:07.861 --> 12:09.362
- Yeah, we're just
talking to your mother.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.364
Are you feeling better, Mariel?
- She is,

12:11.398 --> 12:13.834
but we're going to take off
another day from school.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.804
Now you go rest, okay, honey?

12:19.306 --> 12:21.241
She's having a reaction
to the ketamine,

12:21.274 --> 12:22.776
I should really
get back to her.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.045
- Well, actually,
we have something else

12:25.078 --> 12:28.015
that we need to discuss.
Mariel's meds.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.549
- I don't understand.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.284
- You know, they did
a tox screen at the hospital,

12:31.318 --> 12:34.287
and our medical examiner
found some issues.

12:34.321 --> 12:36.123
She's on Valproate?

12:36.156 --> 12:37.791
- Yes, I told you,
she has epilepsy.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.260
- Mm-hm.

12:40.293 --> 12:44.131
- Did you know the combination
can induce seizures?

12:44.164 --> 12:46.199
- I didn't.
- Yeah, so who recommended

12:46.233 --> 12:48.201
the supplements?

12:49.937 --> 12:53.273
- Well, you know, I'm always
looking for a new regimen.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.475
A new protocol.
I do research online

12:55.508 --> 12:58.045
for alternative medicines
and therapies.

12:58.078 --> 13:01.915
It's a full-time job.
I'm a single mother.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.450
I must have missed something.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.253
- So Mariel's father
is not in the picture?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.055
- He left when she was six.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.323
He couldn't
handle her illnesses.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.359
- I'm sure it
can be overwhelming.

13:12.392 --> 13:16.063
Listen, we can get you
some support or counseling.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.266
- Thank you, but I'm fine.
I'll call Dr. Levy,

13:19.299 --> 13:22.235
I'll have her make an
adjustment to the medication.

13:26.339 --> 13:27.941
- I took Mariel off Paxil

13:27.975 --> 13:29.977
and recommended against
Ginko Biloba a year ago.

13:30.010 --> 13:32.145
- Yeah, but you can see
she's still taking it.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.981
- I doubt her other specialists
would have given her refills

13:34.014 --> 13:35.115
knowing that
she's had seizures.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.850
It must be a mix-up.

13:36.884 --> 13:39.386
- Well, have you seen
this kind of mix

13:39.419 --> 13:41.454
- No, I haven't.
- So...

13:41.488 --> 13:43.891
- Can I ask, is this related
to the sexual encounter?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.026
- It might be, how long has
Mariel been your patient?

13:46.059 --> 13:49.596
- About two years, she was 13.
They were new to the city.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.264
A parent comes in,

13:51.298 --> 13:53.166
tells you about their
child's medical history,

13:53.200 --> 13:54.501
you believe them.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.204
- Well, these,
these other specialists.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.472
Can you tell us what they
were treating her for?

14:02.175 --> 14:03.476
- I'm sorry,
you're going to have to ask

14:03.510 --> 14:05.946
Mariel's mother for
that information.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.248
Thank you for bringing
this to my attention.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.884
I need to make some calls.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.357
So what now,
we ask Barba for a warrant?

14:17.390 --> 14:19.159
- Or, we get a parent's okay

14:19.192 --> 14:20.627
to look at
Mariel's medical history.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.129
- Dawn's not going
to agree to that.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.663
- But Mariel's father might.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.933
- Okay, should we
check in with Fin first?

14:25.966 --> 14:28.401
- Better to ask for
forgiveness than permission.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.471
- I'm not a bad father,
I send money every month.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.274
But her mom tells me
Mariel spending time with me

14:34.307 --> 14:36.043
is too stressful for her.

14:36.076 --> 14:39.279
- Well, Dawn knows what's best.

14:39.312 --> 14:41.014
What she's
gone through with Mariel,

14:41.048 --> 14:43.250
in an out of hospitals
ever since she was a baby.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.285
- So she's been ill
her whole life?

14:45.318 --> 14:48.455
- MD at four, leukemia at six.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.192
You don't know
what a gut punch it is

14:52.225 --> 14:54.227
to see your little girl
losing her hair.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.662
And throwing up.

14:55.695 --> 14:57.330
You know, maybe there
was a part of me

14:57.364 --> 14:59.232
that couldn't handle it.

14:59.266 --> 15:00.968
- But when she was younger,
you were there, right?

15:01.001 --> 15:03.971
The hospitals, the doctors?
- Yeah, I tried.

15:04.004 --> 15:07.474
We moved half a dozen times
chasing the best treatments.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.910
- Did you happen to save
any of those old records?

15:14.214 --> 15:16.716
- Munchausen by Proxy.
A mental illness

15:16.749 --> 15:18.585
where a parent makes up
fake symptoms,

15:18.618 --> 15:20.720
or causes symptoms.
- Medical child abuse.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.522
- Isn't that usually
with younger kids?

15:22.555 --> 15:24.291
- It usually is, yes, but--

15:24.324 --> 15:26.159
- Mariel's 15,
that's a long time

15:26.193 --> 15:27.694
to go along with being sick.

15:27.727 --> 15:30.230
- I'm positive that this
is what we're looking at, Fin.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.532
Multiple diagnoses
from a dozen doctors

15:32.565 --> 15:34.634
that we know of,
from six different states.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.337
50 different medications,
at least ten surgeries.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.571
- Well,
aren't these doctors to blame?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.473
- No, because the mother is...

15:40.507 --> 15:42.742
She's a very smart liar.
Master manipulator.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.311
From one doctor to the next,

15:44.344 --> 15:46.179
she says that they've
lost the records.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.647
So she
fills in the blanks herself.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.349
- And these doctors have
no reason not to believe

15:49.382 --> 15:50.583
what she's been telling them.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.352
- So Dawn has been
medicating Mariel.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.021
She's been making
her own daughter sick.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.356
And she knows how to do it.
She's been getting drugs

15:56.389 --> 15:58.225
from online or off the streets.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.027
- All right.

16:00.060 --> 16:04.397
Now it's time to call
Liv, Barba, and Child Services.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.271
- When can me
and my mom go home?

16:11.304 --> 16:14.774
It's movie night.
Is she okay?

16:14.807 --> 16:18.278
- We're still figuring
some things out.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.048
- She's a smart lady.

16:21.081 --> 16:24.084
- She didn't ask for a lawyer.
- Maybe not that smart.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.452
- Aren't you supposed
to be on leave?

16:25.485 --> 16:26.719
- I am, but I
need to be here.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.255
- I get it.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.656
- We got enough
for a case, Barba?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.524
- Based on the files
you gave me, probably.

16:31.558 --> 16:34.794
I need a full medical
and psych work-up on Mariel.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.763
And I need a court order for a
full psych eval on Dawn.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.167
- She's been getting away
with this for 15 years.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.601
She's good at
covering her tracks.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.571
- So she knows what
she's doing is wrong?

16:48.608 --> 16:52.279
- Mrs. McLaughlin,
I'm Lieutenant Benson.

16:52.312 --> 16:56.816
- Oh, someone in charge, good.
I need to be with Mariel.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.385
She must be so scared.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.620
- Dawn, don't worry.
Mariel is fine.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.655
- So I just have
a few questions

17:02.689 --> 17:05.058
about the number
of different doctors

17:05.092 --> 17:06.526
that Mariel's been to.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.595
- She was born with
a compromised immune system.

17:08.628 --> 17:11.131
She has multiple issues.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.365
Now when did that start?

17:12.399 --> 17:14.434
- May of 2010.
- So it says here

17:14.467 --> 17:17.370
that a doctor Sanders
from North Carolina

17:17.404 --> 17:22.342
conducted a dozen tests from
May to October of that year.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.244
But they were all negative.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.713
- When you have a sick child,
you don't give up

17:26.746 --> 17:29.382
just because one doctor
has his head on backwards.

17:29.416 --> 17:33.320
She was diagnosed in December,
after we moved to New York.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.787
- Do you have
documentation of that?

17:34.821 --> 17:36.489
- I'm still not clear
why you need it.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.191
- Okay, Mrs. McLaughlin,

17:38.225 --> 17:40.493
I'm just going
to be honest with you.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.630
Your daughter's
medical records, her files...

17:43.663 --> 17:46.466
They show that you weren't
looking for doctors

17:46.499 --> 17:48.568
who could cure Mariel.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.238
You were looking for doctors
who would agree with you,

17:51.271 --> 17:54.307
who would say
that she was sick.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.743
- No, I'm a good mother.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.512
I was raised in an ugly,
abusive household.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.315
I am blessed
to have a daughter.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.184
To show her
what love should be.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.752
- That's not love.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.355
That's what you wanted,
not what he wanted.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.357
- Okay, okay.
- She wanted.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.824
- Dawn.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.861
We know you love your daughter.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.230
And you're doing
the best that you can.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.899
And doctors, they don't
always know the answer.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.535
- I just want my child
to be well.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.838
Healthy, happy.
That's all I've ever wanted.

18:25.872 --> 18:29.576
Can you understand that?
- Yes, but you are hurting her.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.212
- No you're wrong.
I'm taking Mariel home.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.646
- No.
Fin!

18:33.680 --> 18:35.682
- Mariel! Mariel!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.350
- No, no, no, Mariel, honey!
- Hold on, hold on, no, no, no.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.885
We're going home right now.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.753
- We're going right now!
- Take it easy, take it easy.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.190
- Oh, no, no, no.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.524
- Let me go, she needs me.

18:44.557 --> 18:45.825
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- Mariel!

18:45.858 --> 18:47.727
- Yeah, she's fine, honey.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.796
I got you, why don't
we sit back down, baby?

18:49.829 --> 18:50.930
Okay?

18:50.963 --> 18:53.600
- Let me go. Mariel!
- Nice and easy, nice and easy.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.302
Let's lower her down...
- She's seizing!

18:55.335 --> 18:56.636
- Mariel!
- It's okay.

18:56.669 --> 18:57.804
- SVU portable, we need a bus.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.539
We have a minor
having a seizure.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.841
- Airway's clear.
Mariel, hang in there, honey.

19:06.513 --> 19:06.679
.

19:06.713 --> 19:07.013
- Mommy!

19:08.315 --> 19:10.250
Mommy?
- Noah!

19:10.283 --> 19:12.585
Noah, come here, baby.
- Mommy, you made it!

19:12.619 --> 19:13.786
- Noah, hey, baby--

19:13.820 --> 19:15.555
- Go outside, Noah.
Go on the porch.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.889
- No!

19:21.428 --> 19:23.830
- Oh, Melinda.

19:23.863 --> 19:27.467
- Yeah, yeah.
How's Mariel?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.801
- Recovering.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.304
She had excessive amounts
of Paxil, Ginko,

19:31.338 --> 19:32.739
and other supplements
in her system,

19:32.772 --> 19:33.940
which caused the seizure.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.210
And how's her health otherwise?

19:37.244 --> 19:38.711
- She'll need more evaluation,

19:38.745 --> 19:41.581
but initial reports
are encouraging.

19:41.614 --> 19:44.484
It appears she doesn't have MD.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.653
Or a seizure disorder.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.256
- Dawn McLaughlin's
being held at Bellevue,

19:49.289 --> 19:51.391
pending her psych eval.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.493
- Rollins is with her.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.495
Her father's driving up
from Pennsylvania.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.830
- Okay.
- Let's get you home.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.899
I got a patrol car outside.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.803
- I'll see you.
- Mm-hm.

20:03.836 --> 20:06.939
Lucy.

20:06.973 --> 20:09.609
Don't wake him.

20:14.381 --> 20:17.917
- If I was really trying
to harm her, I could have.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.020
Mess with her feeding tube,
made her overdose.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.890
- Did you ever think
about doing that?

20:26.058 --> 20:28.461
- I was just trying
to raise her right.

20:28.495 --> 20:31.331
- Because you weren't
raised right?

20:33.500 --> 20:36.703
Did someone hurt you
when you were young, Dawn?

20:39.472 --> 20:41.274
- My stepfather.

20:43.476 --> 20:46.279
But this is about Mariel.
- And you too.

20:46.313 --> 20:49.982
*

20:50.016 --> 20:51.984
How did he hurt you?

20:54.887 --> 20:56.789
- I was abused,
so I'm an abuser?

20:56.823 --> 21:00.527
If her lawyer goes with psych
defense, she could get off.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.695
- Just as long as
she never gets custody

21:02.729 --> 21:04.597
of her daughter again.

21:04.997 --> 21:09.001
- Sometimes I would act like
he hurt me worse than he did.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.804
Then mom would let me
stay home from school.

21:11.838 --> 21:13.640
Just us.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.676
- You taught yourself
how to manipulate authority.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.379
Learned self-preservation.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.985
Dawn.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.554
Why do you think
you gave Mariel

21:27.587 --> 21:30.423
the meds that caused a seizure?

21:32.825 --> 21:34.093
- I just--

21:34.126 --> 21:37.830
I wanted someone to see
that she was sick.

21:37.864 --> 21:39.966
To treat her.

21:46.105 --> 21:48.541
- She fits all the
diagnostic criteria

21:48.575 --> 21:52.812
for Factitious Disorder,
or Munchausen by Proxy.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.715
There's a cognitive distortion
in her thinking.

21:55.748 --> 21:57.484
She knows what
she's doing is wrong,

21:57.517 --> 21:58.951
but she doesn't know
why she's doing it.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.520
And she certainly
can't stop herself.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.021
- Is she competent
to stand trial?

22:02.054 --> 22:03.690
- In my opinion, yes.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.593
But she's going to need
a lot of treatment.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.695
- So is Mariel.

22:08.728 --> 22:11.431
- I don't understand,
I'm not sick?

22:11.464 --> 22:13.666
- No, you're going
to be fine, Mariel.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.702
You're walking,
you're getting stronger.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.970
It's going to take a while,
but you are healthy.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.840
But I'm always so tired,

22:20.873 --> 22:22.975
sick to my stomach, weak.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.011
This can't be.

22:25.044 --> 22:28.548
- I know it's hard, sweetheart.

22:28.581 --> 22:31.618
But your mom
was making you sick.

22:32.952 --> 22:36.823
She was giving you medication
that made you feel bad.

22:41.461 --> 22:44.464
- Mariel, because
there's something wrong

22:44.497 --> 22:46.766
with your mom's brain.

22:48.200 --> 22:51.170
And she didn't understand
how to take care of you.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.139
She didn't know
what was good for you.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.074
She loves me.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.644
- She does love you,
absolutely.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.713
This is a lot to process,

23:00.747 --> 23:03.950
and we are going to get you
a lot of help to feel better.

23:03.983 --> 23:07.720
And Mariel,
you're going to be okay.

23:07.754 --> 23:12.725
*

23:12.759 --> 23:15.061
- Stealing all the ice cream.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.163
- I never trusted
that elephant.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.600
- So, what's happening
with Dawn McLaughlin?

23:20.633 --> 23:22.168
- Yeah, she was
arraigned today.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.169
Charged with
reckless endangerment.

23:23.202 --> 23:24.871
The judge ROR'd her,

23:24.904 --> 23:26.573
which was completely
against my recommendation.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.140
- Rafael.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.877
Do you really think
this woman belongs behind bars?

23:30.910 --> 23:33.513
She's mentally ill, like...

23:37.950 --> 23:39.986
- Noah keeps
asking me to see her.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.421
I don't know what to tell him.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.158
Just avoid the subject
all together.

23:46.192 --> 23:49.095
- Liv, you're going
to get through this.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.698
You've gotten through
a lot worse.

23:57.136 --> 24:00.139
- It's Fin. Hey.

24:03.676 --> 24:06.579
- Dawn just showed up
at Mercy Hospital.

24:09.215 --> 24:11.518
- No! No!

24:11.551 --> 24:13.052
- I'm taking this out of you.
They are hurting you.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.521
- No!
You were the one hurting me!

24:14.554 --> 24:18.057
- Dawn, back up, Dawn!

24:18.090 --> 24:19.592
Now we're going
to have to arrest you.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.528
You can't be here.
- Hey, hey.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.895
You're going to be all right.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.697
- Stay the hell away
from our daughter!

24:24.731 --> 24:27.800
- Mariel, I love you!
- You love me being sick.

24:27.834 --> 24:30.670
You took away my life,
you almost killed me!

24:30.703 --> 24:33.740
- No, they're lying to you!

24:33.773 --> 24:36.643
I'm the only one who knows
how to take care of you.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.978
- Get her out of here.
- I am the only one!

24:40.312 --> 24:42.915
- All I ever wanted was
to be normal.

24:42.949 --> 24:47.720
*

24:47.754 --> 24:50.156
Now I never will.

24:56.295 --> 25:00.567
- Okay, Barba.
Yeah, thanks.

25:01.734 --> 25:04.070
Dawn made bail,
she's out again.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.872
How is that possible?

25:05.905 --> 25:08.541
- One of her supporters raised
the cash through GoFundMe.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.042
I mean, she's not
allowed within 100 feet

25:10.076 --> 25:13.913
of the hospital or Mariel.
They GPS'd them both.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.882
Ugh...

25:15.915 --> 25:18.785
You know, what Dawn
did to her daughter,

25:18.818 --> 25:23.756
she took away her childhood.
It's unforgivable.

25:23.790 --> 25:26.025
But...

25:26.058 --> 25:28.260
She's sick.

25:28.294 --> 25:31.030
I just, I can't
wrap my head around

25:31.063 --> 25:33.833
that we want her punished.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.636
- Listen, Rollins, why don't
you go home and be with Jesse?

25:36.669 --> 25:38.337
I haven't forgotten that you
have a kid too, you know?

25:38.370 --> 25:40.973
- After what Liv
went through, I'm fine.

25:41.007 --> 25:44.577
- Look, you're a single mom.
You're a full-time cop.

25:44.611 --> 25:46.045
Your life is not easy.

25:46.078 --> 25:49.582
And it's okay to say that
out loud every once in a while.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.224
- Rollins.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.129
Mariel?

26:03.162 --> 26:05.598
Okay, you, uh...

26:05.632 --> 26:08.367
You just stay--
you stay where you are.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.037
Okay, we're on our way.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.940
*

26:16.108 --> 26:23.082
*

26:23.115 --> 26:25.785
What did you do?

26:28.320 --> 26:31.791
- You're too late.
She's dead.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.963
I killed her.

26:39.999 --> 26:43.736
*

26:47.907 --> 26:48.074
.

26:48.107 --> 26:48.708
- I felt so good.
Energetic.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.410
Colors were brighter.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.113
I felt alive,
like I was coming out of a fog.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.915
- You were detoxing
from a lot of meds.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.117
- My whole life,
I thought I was stupid.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.119
She did that to me,
my own mother.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.788
- Tell us what
happened earlier.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.122
- You mean after
she came to the hospital

27:03.155 --> 27:05.024
and tried to kill me?
- Listen, Mariel.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.826
That shouldn't have happened,
and I'm very sorry.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.728
But you were safe there.

27:08.761 --> 27:10.930
What if she came back and there
was no one there to stop her?

27:10.963 --> 27:12.231
- Is that why you went
to your mother's apartment?

27:12.264 --> 27:13.800
To stop her?
- I just wanted her

27:13.833 --> 27:15.101
to leave me alone.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.903
I thought if I
brought a weapon,

27:16.936 --> 27:19.906
like that hammer,
she'd listen to me.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.174
- What happened
after you got there?

27:23.175 --> 27:25.678
- She tried to hug me.
I wouldn't let her.

27:25.712 --> 27:28.681
She went to get my pills
so I'd calm down, she said.

27:28.715 --> 27:31.383
I said I didn't need pills,
to leave me alone.

27:32.919 --> 27:34.954
- She said I was
her daughter forever.

27:34.987 --> 27:38.224
That I'd always need her
to take care of me.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.863
So I hit her with the hammer.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.167
*

27:48.200 --> 27:50.369
- Was your mother
trying to hurt you?

27:50.402 --> 27:51.904
Was she threatening you?
- I just knew she was

27:51.938 --> 27:53.205
never going to let me go.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.241
I had to.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.276
Mariel, were you--

27:57.309 --> 28:01.247
I felt good.
I was in control for once.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.717
Not her.
- Mariel, stop talking.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.919
My daughter was brutalized.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.888
And whatever happened,
Dawn deserved it.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.923
I mean, you see that, right?

28:10.957 --> 28:13.325
I mean, you can let her go now.

28:13.359 --> 28:15.427
- I'm sorry, I can't do that.

28:15.461 --> 28:19.198
- Well, I'm calling a lawyer.
- No, I think you should.

28:19.231 --> 28:26.272
*

28:28.374 --> 28:31.143
- Cause of death
was blunt force trauma.

28:31.177 --> 28:34.213
The wound is consistent with
having been hit from behind.

28:34.246 --> 28:36.448
The first blow caused her
to fall to the floor.

28:36.482 --> 28:39.451
- Not necessarily.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.954
Knocking someone out
is harder than you think.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.990
And she was clutching
her head with both hands.

28:44.023 --> 28:47.026
- I would say absolutely.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.228
- How many blows
did the defendant strike

28:49.261 --> 28:51.530
after her mother
was incapacitated,

28:51.563 --> 28:54.166
clutching her head?
- Three.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.236
- From the cast-off.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.505
Stripes of blood on the wall.
There were three.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.373
When the hammer
was pulled back,

29:01.407 --> 29:04.977
blood spattered onto the wall,
forming a line pattern.

29:05.011 --> 29:06.378
- Thank you.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.384
- Dr. Warner,
you evaluated a tox screen

29:12.418 --> 29:15.287
done on Mariel as part of a
rape kit several weeks ago.

29:15.321 --> 29:17.256
- Yes.
- And you found multiple

29:17.289 --> 29:19.491
counteractive medications
and supplements.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.393
- That's right.
- Side effects include

29:21.427 --> 29:25.898
a higher risk of seizure,
confusion, lack of judgment.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.000
- Yes, but at the
time of the murder,

29:28.034 --> 29:29.869
she had detoxed
for several days.

29:29.902 --> 29:33.272
- Have you ever seen a case of
Munchausen by Proxy like this?

29:33.305 --> 29:36.242
With 15 years
of prescription abuse?

29:36.275 --> 29:38.510
- No, I haven't.
- So you don't know the effects

29:38.544 --> 29:40.479
that this type
of long-term abuse could have,

29:40.512 --> 29:43.883
or how long it might take
to fully detox.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.451
- No.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.019
- Thank you.

29:47.053 --> 29:49.121
- Redirect, Your Honor.

29:51.323 --> 29:54.894
- Dr. Warner.
From the position of the body,

29:54.927 --> 29:57.163
the number of blows,
the blood spatter.

29:57.196 --> 30:00.099
In your opinion, is this
consistent with self

30:00.132 --> 30:02.301
- Not likely, no.

30:02.334 --> 30:05.838
- People rest.

30:05.872 --> 30:08.307
- We call Dr. Elizabeth Olivet.

30:10.142 --> 30:12.912
Dr. Olivet,
you examined Mariel

30:12.945 --> 30:15.314
48 hours after she was informed

30:15.347 --> 30:18.284
her mother had been diagnosed
with Munchausen by Proxy.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.019
Is that right?
- Yes.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.288
- So after she found out
that her mother

30:22.321 --> 30:24.924
had force-fed her medications,

30:24.957 --> 30:27.459
subjected her
to multiple and painful

30:27.493 --> 30:30.262
unnecessary medical treatments
and surgeries,

30:30.296 --> 30:31.998
had in effect,
destroyed her childhood.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.632
- Yes.
- Did you find

30:33.665 --> 30:37.536
she was suffering from PTSD,
mood imbalances, dissociation?

30:37.569 --> 30:40.172
- Yes, but that didn't
alter my conclusion

30:40.206 --> 30:42.341
that Mariel
knew right from wrong.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.543
She was aware of the
consequences of her actions.

30:44.576 --> 30:47.146
- Wasn't she terrified
of her mother?

30:47.179 --> 30:49.348
Afraid she'd never
escape her control?

30:49.381 --> 30:51.350
- She expressed
some of those feelings, yes.

30:51.383 --> 30:56.288
But she also expressed extreme
anger and rage at her mother.

31:00.659 --> 31:03.462
- Defense exhibit D.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.997
A copy of the DSM-5

31:05.031 --> 31:07.099
and articles on
Munchausen by Proxy

31:07.133 --> 31:09.001
that Mariel
had Googled that day.

31:09.035 --> 31:10.602
Can you read
the highlighted section?

31:10.636 --> 31:13.505
- "Despite the number of cases
of Munchausen by Proxy,

31:13.539 --> 31:15.607
"that have been
evaluated and treated,

31:15.641 --> 31:19.245
there is little research
on effective treatment."

31:19.278 --> 31:22.214
- And this, defense exhibit E.

31:22.248 --> 31:24.183
The state of New York
sentencing guidelines

31:24.216 --> 31:25.952
for reckless endangerment.

31:25.985 --> 31:28.520
- The crime that Mariel's
mother had been charged with.

31:28.554 --> 31:31.323
I've highlighted
the minimum sentence, which is?

31:31.357 --> 31:34.126
- One year.
- So after Mariel found out

31:34.160 --> 31:37.263
that there is
no treatment for Munchausen's.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.165
After finding out the sentence

31:39.198 --> 31:41.333
could be as minimal
as one year.

31:41.367 --> 31:44.403
A few hours after her mother

31:44.436 --> 31:47.006
had violated
an order of protection

31:47.039 --> 31:49.976
and tried to pull out her IV.

31:50.009 --> 31:52.211
Is it possible that Mariel

31:52.244 --> 31:54.280
lost faith in the system
to protect her,

31:54.313 --> 31:58.584
and felt her only option
was to defend herself?

31:58.617 --> 32:00.519
To save her own life?

32:00.552 --> 32:04.256
*

32:04.290 --> 32:06.325
- It's possible, yes.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.097
- Nothing further.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.201
- Mr. Barba.

32:15.234 --> 32:17.503
- No questions, Your Honor.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.405
- Mariel did use
the hospital computer

32:19.438 --> 32:21.173
to research
Munchausen by Proxy.

32:21.207 --> 32:22.308
- A few hours.

32:22.341 --> 32:23.575
And the defense claims

32:23.609 --> 32:25.277
that's part of her
emotional disturbance?

32:25.311 --> 32:27.179
- All it takes
is one juror, what else?

32:27.213 --> 32:29.148
- Well, that's it
for her Google searches,

32:29.181 --> 32:31.383
but she did watch
"The Little Mermaid"

32:31.417 --> 32:34.353
seven times in three days.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.588
- Well, her classmate, Cody.
The 19-year-old with autism.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.257
- We didn't charge him.
- Well, Mariel thought

32:38.290 --> 32:39.725
that she was
the Little Mermaid,

32:39.758 --> 32:42.228
and that Cody
was her Prince Eric.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.502
- My whole life,
I wanted to be normal.

32:50.536 --> 32:54.706
Like a real girl, but I was
always in the hospital

32:54.740 --> 32:57.276
Sick, tired.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.611
Food didn't taste good.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.714
I had trouble
using the bathroom.

33:02.748 --> 33:07.086
I couldn't walk.
I couldn't think clearly.

33:07.119 --> 33:10.622
- I'm getting healthier.

33:10.656 --> 33:14.460
Stronger every day.
I feel like I have hope.

33:14.493 --> 33:18.597
- How did you react when you
found out that your mother

33:18.630 --> 33:20.232
had made you ill?

33:20.266 --> 33:22.568
- At first,
I couldn't believe it.

33:22.601 --> 33:25.771
But then when I started
to feel better,

33:25.804 --> 33:28.474
I realized it was true.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.810
I was sad,
but I was with my dad,

33:31.843 --> 33:35.681
and mostly I didn't want
to think about her anymore.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.151
- Tell me about the day

33:39.185 --> 33:40.586
you went to your
mother's apartment.

33:40.619 --> 33:43.355
- I was having a good day.
I was up.

33:43.389 --> 33:46.058
Walking on my own.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.527
Then my mom came in,

33:48.560 --> 33:50.429
she was yelling.

33:50.462 --> 33:53.499
She tried to tear my IV out.

33:53.532 --> 33:57.669
The cops took her away.

33:57.703 --> 34:02.274
- Scared, like I'd never
get away from her.

34:03.175 --> 34:06.778
So when my dad left the room...

34:06.812 --> 34:08.547
I snuck out.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.483
I got a hammer from his truck.

34:11.517 --> 34:13.785
I went to my mom's apartment.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.691
- To tell her
to leave me alone.

34:19.725 --> 34:24.363
- I told her to stay away.

34:24.396 --> 34:27.266
She said that
would never happen.

34:27.299 --> 34:29.168
That the jury
would feel sorry for her

34:29.201 --> 34:31.670
and not put her in jail.

34:31.703 --> 34:35.507
That there was nothing I could
do to keep her away from me.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.712
- I must have swung the hammer.

34:40.746 --> 34:43.482
I just remember
feeling so afraid.

34:43.515 --> 34:46.785
Like I'd never be free, ever.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.754
- Thank you Mariel.

34:48.787 --> 34:50.522
Nothing further.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.496
- Hi, Mariel.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.565
- Hi.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.467
- I'm very sorry
for what you've been through

35:01.500 --> 35:03.669
in your life,
and the last thing I want to do

35:03.702 --> 35:06.605
is cause you more pain,
but I have...

35:06.638 --> 35:08.840
I have a few questions, okay?

35:08.874 --> 35:10.742
- I understand.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.478
- After your mother
came to your hospital room,

35:12.511 --> 35:14.213
you decided to confront her.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.415
- Yes.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.451
- From the timeline that was

35:19.485 --> 35:22.321
a few hours later,
does that sound about right?

35:22.354 --> 35:23.722
- I guess.
- Do you remember

35:23.755 --> 35:27.393
what you did
during those two hours?

35:28.760 --> 35:30.529
Do you remember watching
"The Little Mermaid"

35:30.562 --> 35:32.498
on the hospital computer?

35:32.531 --> 35:35.701
- Objection, relevance.
- I'll get there, Your Honor.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.636
- I'll allow it.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.539
- Yes, I did.

35:40.572 --> 35:41.807
- Yes.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.509
- You thought
you were the Little Mermaid,

35:43.542 --> 35:45.511
and your friend Cody
was Prince Eric?

35:45.544 --> 35:48.280
- Yes.
- Mariel.

35:49.281 --> 35:52.384
- Yes.

35:52.418 --> 35:54.886
- What did your mother
feel about that?

35:54.920 --> 35:59.258
- She said I was too sick
to have a boyfriend.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.493
Too sick to get married.

36:01.527 --> 36:03.362
- Your mother took you
out of that school, didn't she?

36:03.395 --> 36:05.664
- She said because of Cody.

36:05.697 --> 36:09.535
It's why the police came
to the school, our house.

36:09.568 --> 36:12.338
- Objection.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.806
- I'll allow it.

36:16.642 --> 36:19.511
- She told me
I'd never see Cody again.

36:19.545 --> 36:22.414
That I'd never
get out of the wheelchair.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.682
- You were angry
that she stole your childhood,

36:23.715 --> 36:25.551
and she wouldn't
let you grow up?

36:25.584 --> 36:28.420
- Ariel, in the movie,
is mad at her father,

36:28.454 --> 36:30.756
but he let her get married.

36:30.789 --> 36:34.693
My mother was like Ursula,
evil.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.528
- You were angry she wouldn't
let you be a real girl?

36:36.562 --> 36:39.998
- I am a real girl!
I'm not a mermaid.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.234
She was never going to let me.

36:42.268 --> 36:44.903
Never going to let you what?
- Never going to let me.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.638
- All right.

36:46.672 --> 36:49.608
- I hate her!
I hate her, I hate her!

36:49.641 --> 36:50.909
- Move to strike,
non-responsive.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.411
- I wanted her dead.

36:52.444 --> 36:55.314
I'm glad I did it,
I'm not sorry.

36:58.350 --> 37:05.524
*

37:16.735 --> 37:16.868
.

37:16.902 --> 37:17.469
- You did your job, Rafael.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.573
- I also might have sent

37:21.607 --> 37:23.842
a horrifically abused
teenager to prison.

37:23.875 --> 37:27.379
- They could acquit.

37:27.413 --> 37:30.849
Or you could drop the charges.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.484
- I drop the charges,

37:32.518 --> 37:34.320
that's tantamount to saying
there's no rule of law.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.455
That the judicial system
changes its mind.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.524
Makes exceptions on a whim.

37:38.557 --> 37:40.859
Or for sympathetic defendants.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.832
Yeah, that's the jury's
determination, not mine.

37:46.865 --> 37:49.601
- Well, the law says
she's guilty.

37:49.635 --> 37:53.639
But your heart says she's not.
So...

37:55.407 --> 37:57.609
So what are you going to do?

37:57.643 --> 37:59.711
- I don't know.

38:05.050 --> 38:06.985
I don't know.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.760
I know it's been
a very long run--

38:14.793 --> 38:17.329
Hold the door, please.
Thank you.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.498
Yeah, I'm heading back in now.
Look, I don't want the girl

38:19.531 --> 38:21.567
to get life either,
but that's the law.

38:21.600 --> 38:22.768
I'm in the elevator,
I got to go.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.371
Okay, thanks.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.344
She could get life in prison?

38:38.484 --> 38:40.852
- You're jurors on the case.

38:40.886 --> 38:43.389
I didn't realize you were here.

38:45.424 --> 38:46.992
- I would not have expected
this from you, Mr. Barba.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.794
- I apologize, Your Honor.

38:48.827 --> 38:49.928
- We can discuss how
and why this happened

38:49.961 --> 38:52.398
after we adjourn.
For now,

38:52.431 --> 38:54.800
Ms. Glazer, I need
to confirm what happened.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.602
You three saw
Mr. Barba this morning.

38:56.635 --> 38:57.903
- Yes, in the elevator.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.938
- And what did you
overhear him say?

38:59.971 --> 39:03.875
- He said Mariel McLaughlin
could get life in prison.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.711
- And you two
overheard this as well?

39:05.744 --> 39:07.446
- Yes, Your Honor.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.116
I have no choice.
I hereby declare a mistrial.

39:11.149 --> 39:12.884
- I'd like to apologize
to the court,

39:12.918 --> 39:15.554
to Ms. McLaughlin,
and to Ms. Miglani.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.423
And if defense council agrees,

39:17.456 --> 39:19.558
I'd ask for the case
to be moved to family court.

39:19.591 --> 39:22.060
- I can only hope this wasn't
your intent in the first place.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.730
And if I find out
it was, God help you.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.498
So waived, we're adjourned.

39:26.532 --> 39:30.436
Mr. Barba,
report to my chambers now.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.838
*

39:32.871 --> 39:36.708
- See you guys
at 3:00, thank you.

39:36.742 --> 39:37.976
- There you are.

39:38.009 --> 39:39.778
What are you doing here?

39:39.811 --> 39:41.413
- I was in the building,
checking in with Dodds.

39:41.447 --> 39:45.183
You know I got to come
back to work eventually.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.718
You okay?

39:46.752 --> 39:48.787
I heard Judge Barth
read you the riot act.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.856
- I deserved it.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.558
- Well, whether you
deserved it or not,

39:52.591 --> 39:55.927
I have absolute faith

39:55.961 --> 39:57.763
in your humanity.

39:59.698 --> 40:02.033
- The family court judge gave
Mariel a three year sentence.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.736
Suspended to probation,
community service.

40:04.770 --> 40:08.674
With the stipulation of regular
mental health evaluations.

40:08.707 --> 40:11.510
- So...

40:11.543 --> 40:14.145
Justice was served.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.181
- Hope so.

40:18.149 --> 40:20.886
- My dad rented
an apartment for us.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.788
I have to keep seeing
a psychiatrist,

40:22.821 --> 40:25.123
and do community service.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.759
Cody's going
to volunteer with me.

40:27.793 --> 40:30.496
I think I'm going
to like helping people.

40:30.529 --> 40:31.763
- Sure you will.
- Mariel.

40:31.797 --> 40:34.065
I know you lost a lot of years,

40:34.099 --> 40:37.469
but you've got
your whole life ahead of you.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.237
- Yeah.

40:39.270 --> 40:42.508
Can I ask you something?

40:42.541 --> 40:45.777
Do you think it's wrong
that I miss my mother?

40:48.814 --> 40:50.516
*

40:50.549 --> 40:53.084
- No, I don't.

40:54.620 --> 40:56.622
- Mariel, let's go.

40:56.655 --> 40:59.625
- Hey, you take care
of yourself, okay?

40:59.658 --> 41:01.627
- Thank you.

41:04.696 --> 41:07.666
- So you want to grab a cup
of coffee before we head back?

41:07.699 --> 41:10.602
- You know, actually,
I'm going to head home.

41:10.636 --> 41:14.873
Can you cover for me with Fin?
- Yeah, you got it.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.944
- There's ten seconds
left of the clock.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.579
They're going
to make a comeback.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.548
But there she goes!
She steals the ball,

41:22.581 --> 41:24.650
she heads across the court,
she shoots--

41:24.683 --> 41:27.819
She  scores!

41:27.853 --> 41:30.221
Yeah, that's right!

41:30.255 --> 41:32.490
Yes!

41:39.064 --> 41:41.266
Hi, Mom. It's me.

41:43.168 --> 41:45.904
Yes, I know it's been a while.

41:45.937 --> 41:48.607
Can you just
be happy I called?

41:50.041 --> 41:52.310
Okay, wait, listen, um...

41:52.343 --> 41:55.714
Can you say hello
to Jesse for me?

41:55.747 --> 41:57.115
Okay.

41:57.148 --> 41:59.785
Can you say "hi, grandma"?
- Hi, grandma.

42:01.286 --> 42:02.988
You heard her?

42:03.021 --> 42:10.195
*

42:20.572 --> 42:20.739
.

42:23.642 --> 42:30.682
*
