WEBVTT

00:20.938 --> 00:24.101
(SIGHING)
Okay, therafy me.

00:33.825 --> 00:35.031
You're late.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.278
You're fat.

00:39.081 --> 00:40.241
It's unusual.

00:40.332 --> 00:44.746
You know how far
the parking lot is?
My Ieg's been hurting.

00:44.836 --> 00:47.248
Anything been on
your mind lately?
Any particular stress?

00:47.339 --> 00:49.955
Nope. Probably
just gonna rain.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.039
Hmm.

00:51.134 --> 00:54.501
You like the new
Monet reproduction
in the waiting room?

00:54.638 --> 00:56.424
The Water Lilies?

00:57.015 --> 01:00.678
lwas late. lwasn't
focusing on the decor,

01:00.811 --> 01:03.928
but it sounds
appropriately bland
and calming.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.308
Stress can also make
you absent-minded.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.311
I'm not stressed.

01:08.986 --> 01:12.319
Beyond the stress induced
by you telling me
how stressed I am.

01:13.532 --> 01:15.113
Just an ordinary week.

01:17.869 --> 01:18.995
Okay.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.825
Tell me about it.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.742
(WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA)

01:26.837 --> 01:28.498
HOUSE: / had a patient...

01:28.589 --> 01:29.999
CUDDY: House?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.503
Good, I have
a case for you.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.084
Beer?

01:35.178 --> 01:36.338
Amnesia.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.134
She was found
jogging in the street,
disoriented.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.260
She almost got hit
by a truck.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.558
The MRI showed
no abnormalities.

01:43.687 --> 01:47.145
No ID on her,
just herjogging clothes
and her heart rate monitor.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.473
We know absolutely
nothing about her.

01:49.568 --> 01:51.274
HOUSE: We know
she has money.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.228
Blaze Outriggers,
400 bucks a pair.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.400
People who have money
don't just disappear.

01:56.491 --> 01:59.107
Sooner or later,
someone is gonna
show up looking for her.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.328
Can I have
something to eat?

02:00.412 --> 02:02.949
She just ate
15 minutes ago.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.120
She keeps forgetting.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.449
You don't eat
because you remember
it's time to eat,

02:07.544 --> 02:08.750
you eat because
you're hungry.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.953
Her metabolism
is in high gear.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.630
She is an extreme
long-distance runner who...

02:13.717 --> 02:15.753
NOLAN:
Why were you in the ER?

02:16.553 --> 02:17.713
That's your question?

02:19.222 --> 02:22.180
You're a psychotherapist,
you're hearing about
a great amnesia case,

02:22.267 --> 02:23.973
and all you're
asking me is geography?

02:24.061 --> 02:25.892
Just curious.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.099
l was avoiding Wilson.

02:33.737 --> 02:37.275
It's not something
you couldn't have seen
eight miles away.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.822
Wilson’s a processor.

02:39.910 --> 02:43.744
/ knew there were some
things that he’d want
to process with me.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.206
At length.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.996
Sam's moving in.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.701
If it's before Friday,
your assistant wins
the pool.

02:50.796 --> 02:54.254
l was just wondering
what your plans were.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.253
Tonight?
In life.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.752
Sam likes you...

03:00.847 --> 03:02.178
But she wants me
to move out.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.516
No.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.926
I want you to move out.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.683
I didn't know things
with Sam would happen
so quickly.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.436
I didn't...
I don't want to make
a mistake here.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.642
I've made a lot
of mistakes.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.317
By moving too quickly.

03:16.446 --> 03:17.856
Given your usual
rate of commitment,

03:17.948 --> 03:20.109
I'm surprised you're
not already re-divorced.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.988
I could help you
find a place.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.114
What's wrong
with my old place?

03:25.205 --> 03:30.040
Nothing. ljust thought
you might want to
find somewhere new.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.617
Somewhere...

03:32.546 --> 03:34.832
Where I didn't abuse
drugs and hallucinate?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.543
Yes.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.378
I'm fine.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.458
NOLAN: You’re fine?

03:41.972 --> 03:44.714
Your best friend
is tossing you out,
and you're fine?

03:45.642 --> 03:47.348
Why wouldn't I be?

04:24.890 --> 04:29.680
You're not feeling
a little betrayed
and angry?

04:30.896 --> 04:32.727
Wilson bought
a two-bedroom condo

04:32.814 --> 04:34.315
specifically so that
you could move in
with him.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.264
It wasn't
that long ago.

04:36.485 --> 04:39.352
You don't feel
a little jerked around?

04:40.989 --> 04:43.651
He couldn't foresee
Sam coming back
into his life.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.074
That's a very
rational defense
of your friend,

04:46.161 --> 04:48.447
and I'm not buying it.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.653
Based on what?

04:49.748 --> 04:52.034
Based on the fact
that you were late,

04:52.125 --> 04:54.207
and you didn't
notice the pictures
in the outer office.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.454
Those aren't symptoms.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.625
They are to me.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.830
And here's another one,
you took the case. Hmm.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.541
No negotiating.
No bargaining.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.922
No clinic hours
changed hands.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.469
Were you looking
for something
to distract you

05:06.556 --> 05:08.217
from the fact that
your best friend
just threw you out?

05:09.267 --> 05:10.473
The case was interesting.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.597
It's not organic,
it's not mysterious.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.851
Most likely
some psychologically
traumatic event occurred

05:16.942 --> 05:20.309
that made
the patient's brain choose
to forget everything.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.483
Or not.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.437
HOUSE: Here.

05:23.782 --> 05:27.149
Loss of differentiation
between gray
and white matter.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.484
TAUB: lt's subtle.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.114
But it's in the area
that controls memory.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.116
Not likely
it's a coincidence.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.118
Bacterial infection?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.575
Do I need
to know this?

05:37.295 --> 05:39.001
Fine, I'll give you
the CliffNotes version.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.205
Chase, MS.
Taub, physical trauma.

05:41.299 --> 05:42.960
I could tell you
why we ruled them out.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.416
Or not.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.799
It's probably a toxin,
and we need to find
it before it kills her.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.096
We should
search her house.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.389
Good luck with that.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.930
Her heart rate monitor
has a serial number.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.603
The distributor
can match the number
to the store that sold it.

05:57.691 --> 05:58.931
She's a serious athlete.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.640
She might have been there
often enough to be remembered.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.191
Brilliant.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.860
Did he really say that?

06:03.947 --> 06:05.107
Subtextually.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.195
Long shot.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.865
Even if the store clerk
does know who she is,

06:08.952 --> 06:10.488
the store's probably
close to where she lives.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.444
Just seeing
those surroundings
might spark a memory.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.870
You want us to
take her there?

06:13.957 --> 06:15.288
No.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.293
I'll take her.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.121
Really?

06:19.963 --> 06:22.796
lt's unusual for you to
spend time with a patient,
isn't it?

06:22.924 --> 06:25.791
Patients are boring,
as people.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.376
This one, I'm sure,
was no exception,

06:27.470 --> 06:30.303
but her situation
was interesting.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.722
Besides, lwas
still avoiding Wilson,

06:32.809 --> 06:35.050
and no better way to avoid
than leaving the hospital.

06:35.145 --> 06:38.433
Maybe. Or were you
avoiding going home?

06:38.857 --> 06:40.313
There's a reason
they tell addicts

06:40.400 --> 06:41.765
to stay away
from old geography.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.397
I wasn't avoiding going home.
I'd already gone home,

06:45.322 --> 06:47.278
before / came in
to work that day.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.276
/ went straight
there from Wilson’s.

06:52.829 --> 06:53.909
(THUD)

06:53.997 --> 06:55.578
ALVlE: Hey! Take it easy.
You're gonna kill me.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.201
God, why don't
people knock...

06:57.292 --> 07:00.750
House, it's you!
Where you been?
Hold up a second.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.414
NOLAN: Alvie?

07:02.756 --> 07:05.463
Juan Alvarez?
You let him stay
at your place?

07:06.176 --> 07:07.666
Not exactly.

07:09.512 --> 07:10.843
(THUD)

07:12.182 --> 07:14.264
l was beginning to
wonder if you were
ever gonna show up.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.512
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

07:18.104 --> 07:19.184
Why are you here?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.763
When I left Mayfield,
I went back to
the old neighborhood.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.940
You know, you shouldn't leave
the bathroom window unlocked.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.939
Yeah, thanks for
the safety lesson.
Why are you here?

07:27.030 --> 07:28.486
Like I said,
when I went back
to the neighborhood,

07:28.573 --> 07:30.234
I found out Immigration
was looking for me.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.941
So I decided to visit
my old buddy House.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.778
And turn his apartment
into a giant prison
jumpsuit.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.112
Juan Alvarez is
no freeloader.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.788
I do my part,
earn my keep.

07:38.875 --> 07:41.207
The first week,
I made you dinner,
but you never showed up.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.034
The second week,
I organized your stuff.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.203
My stuff?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.378
But still,
you never showed up.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.878
So this week, since
I'm a real good painter,
I decided to feng shui...

07:48.969 --> 07:51.210
Coffee table.
Where'd you put it?

07:53.723 --> 07:55.133
In the bedroom?

07:55.225 --> 07:57.807
The paint's
notcheap,House.
It's a custom color.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.634
It's a mix of
titanium yellow
and ochre.

07:59.729 --> 08:00.980
Ochre. I don't even
like that stuff.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.474
It's like a fruit,
it's got hair on it,

08:02.565 --> 08:03.600
but they say
it's a vegetable...

08:03.692 --> 08:07.355
You sold my table
to pay for paint
that I don't want?

08:09.489 --> 08:12.231
I had to sell some
other things, too.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.485
Get out.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.161
No, papa, just give
the color a chance.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.615
Look, I'm going
to work now.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.416
And when I come back,
the walls will be

08:23.503 --> 08:25.539
a less exciting color,
and you will be gone.

08:27.924 --> 08:33.419
So Wilson threw you out,
and you threw Alvie out.
Just another week?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.219
HOUSE: But unlike me,
Alvie didn't leave.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.092
I took my motorcycle
to work that day.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.435
When I went home
to get my car,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.885
he was painting
the ceiling magenta.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.930
So I brought him with me
to protect the apartment.

08:45.608 --> 08:46.688
VVhy?

08:46.776 --> 08:48.516
To protect the apartment.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.940
Whoa, deja vu.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.317
Tossing him out,
or sending him
to the movies,

08:53.408 --> 08:55.319
or locking him
in the bathroom

08:55.410 --> 08:57.822
would also minimize
Alvie's destructive force.

08:57.912 --> 09:01.700
But you chose his company
deliberately. Why?

09:01.791 --> 09:03.873
Obviously, because
he's a Wilson substitute.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.700
You can barely
tell the difference
between them,

09:05.795 --> 09:07.535
especially when Wilson
raps about the 'hood.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.370
I'm not suggesting
Alvie's a substitute,

09:09.466 --> 09:11.377
but he would make
a great distraction.

09:11.468 --> 09:12.628
From what?

09:12.719 --> 09:14.459
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.471
Go on.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.261
Maybe the heart rate
monitor was a gift.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.732
That's why no one
recognized her.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.522
Shut up, Alvie.

09:28.610 --> 09:32.819
Anything familiar?
Church? Grocery store?

09:33.698 --> 09:34.904
Sorry.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.197
It's okay, Miss X.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.112
Maybe she's never been
to this town before.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.410
Bought the heart rate monitor
on the store's website.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.579
You know that Puerto Ricans
are US citizens, right?

09:42.665 --> 09:44.326
Instead of working the case,
why don't you contemplate

09:44.417 --> 09:46.999
the inanity of an American
with American immigration
issues?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.169
I had a birth certificate.
I lost it.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.166
So get a new one.
I tried that, House.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.122
But the town hall
had burned down
when l was a kid,

09:53.218 --> 09:54.583
destroyed the records.

09:54.677 --> 09:55.837
There's only one copy?

09:56.346 --> 09:58.507
They tried to make me
fill out a whole bunch
of forms

09:58.598 --> 09:59.633
before they'd
give it to me.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.636
I decided it'd be
quicker and easier
to do it myself.

10:02.727 --> 10:03.762
How'd that go?

10:03.853 --> 10:04.968
They figured out
it was forged,

10:05.063 --> 10:07.179
and now, for some reason,
they don't believe
anything I say.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.650
They actually think
I'm lying about
being Puerto Rican.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.567
Told me I had to go
to a special hearing
to prove it.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.145
What if nothing
ever looks familiar?

10:18.076 --> 10:20.988
Then someone
will show up,
a spouse, a friend,

10:21.079 --> 10:22.364
to tell you who
you really are

10:22.455 --> 10:23.831
and what you
should be feeling.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.200
They always do.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.538
I don't know
who that is,
but I miss him.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.123
What did they say
at the hearing?

10:35.218 --> 10:37.675
I didn't go.
I lied once.

10:37.762 --> 10:38.968
Your mother's
Puerto Rican,

10:39.055 --> 10:40.170
therefore you are
Puerto Rican.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.755
All you gotta do
is prove your mom
is your mom.

10:41.850 --> 10:42.965
Find some
documentation...

10:43.059 --> 10:45.516
People like that
don't listen to
people like me.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.184
Donuts. Hey, House,
let's get donuts!

10:47.272 --> 10:48.261
Alvie, the hearing...

10:48.356 --> 10:49.436
Everyone loves donuts.

10:49.524 --> 10:52.311
Glazed, crullers,
elephant ears,
even donut holes.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.562
Much better than
the sporting goods store.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.268
I bet Mrs. X went there
all the time.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.899
We're not here...

10:57.574 --> 10:59.405
HOUSE: And then / realized...

11:00.243 --> 11:01.403
You make a good point.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.112
Dozen glazed,
dozen jelly-filled?

11:06.791 --> 11:08.827
You want
the usual, right?

11:09.210 --> 11:12.043
Your old friend,
the fried carbohydrate.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.586
She needed
the calorically
dense food

11:13.673 --> 11:14.662
to support
the running habit.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.588
Do you know her name?

11:18.928 --> 11:21.920
Sandy or Shelley,
I don't know.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.926
The guy she's with
called her that once.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.180
| just work here.

11:25.268 --> 11:26.929
Do you know
where they live?

11:27.562 --> 11:30.679
He left a business card
in our free donut jar.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.309
It's up on
the Wall of Winners.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.897
(RINGS)

11:40.533 --> 11:41.568
Sidney.

11:43.786 --> 11:47.153
God, lwas
so worried about you.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.115
What happened?

12:00.303 --> 12:02.214
The police said
it was too soon
to do anything,

12:02.305 --> 12:04.717
so I started calling
hospitals on my own.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.934
Princeton-Plainsboro
wasn't even on my list.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.350
You really think
something around here
could have made her sick?

12:09.437 --> 12:12.395
HOUSE: Here, work,
anywhere she could
have been exposed.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.723
Why wasn't
Princeton-Plainsboro
on your list?

12:14.817 --> 12:18.480
Well, I mean,
it's a long way to run,
even for her.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.946
What is it I do
besides run?

12:25.328 --> 12:29.037
You're a lawyer.
Civil rights,
class-action suits.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.793
That doesn't
sound like me.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.041
Do you have any idea
what would sound like you?

12:38.716 --> 12:40.047
Good point.

12:40.134 --> 12:43.092
NOLAN: So what
were you thinking
during all this?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.761
HOUSE: That it was
a strange position
to be in.

12:46.391 --> 12:47.927
At that moment,
she was more comfortable

12:48.017 --> 12:49.928
with me than
with her husband.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.180
And he was
picking up on it.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.683
What about you?

12:55.233 --> 12:56.473
What about me how?

12:57.193 --> 13:01.402
There was a sort of
artificial intimacy
between you.

13:02.156 --> 13:03.282
She had been
dependent on you.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.028
Did you find
that attractive
on some level?

13:07.578 --> 13:08.784
Disturbing?

13:08.871 --> 13:10.077
Those are
my two choices?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.371
None of the above.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.742
She was just a patient.
She was interesting.

13:19.090 --> 13:22.378
So we're really married.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.925
For four years.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.428
Miss X, you lead
a lemon-fresh life.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.471
I found three
different cleansers
under the sink.

13:29.559 --> 13:30.969
Cleaned out
the medicine cabinets, too.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.642
You know,
she just won a settlement
for some families

13:33.730 --> 13:36.437
whose housing development
was built on
an old methane field.

13:36.607 --> 13:39.064
HOUSE: A toxic
exposure to methane
could explain this.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.479
l surf?

13:41.571 --> 13:42.856
You stopped
before we met.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.692
You've been too busy.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.783
And we're married?

13:49.954 --> 13:51.034
Yes.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.658
ALVlE: All right,
it's nothing personal.

13:52.749 --> 13:53.864
I bet she didn't think
you were her type

13:53.958 --> 13:55.994
back when you
first met either.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.746
HOUSE: We'll take her
back to the hospital,

13:57.837 --> 14:00.499
test her blood
and urine,
start treatment.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.007
(SIDNEY GROANS)

14:02.091 --> 14:04.002
Are you okay?
I'm all right.

14:04.761 --> 14:05.796
What happened?

14:05.887 --> 14:08.469
I don't know. My foot
suddenly went numb.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.091
Her pants are wet.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.140
Urinary incontinence.

14:13.936 --> 14:18.600
She's having
complex partial seizures.
This isn't methane.

14:19.484 --> 14:20.769
And you can
leave the bucket.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.849
We need to get her...

14:21.944 --> 14:22.899
NOLAN: Seizures?

14:22.987 --> 14:24.022
(CHUCKLES)

14:24.113 --> 14:25.899
This is
the second diagnosis
you've come up with

14:25.990 --> 14:27.696
that has a personal
resonance for you.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.030
I'm choosing my diagnoses
based on personal issues?

14:31.412 --> 14:33.323
You think she fell
down the stairs
and peed her pants

14:33.414 --> 14:34.529
'cause Wilson
dumped her, too?

14:34.624 --> 14:37.240
You're choosing to
tell me about this case.
So let's look at it.

14:37.335 --> 14:39.997
First, you were fixated
on a harmful toxin
from her past,

14:40.088 --> 14:41.077
possibly because
you're worried

14:41.172 --> 14:42.287
about a harmful
toxin from your...

14:42.382 --> 14:45.169
Chase had the toxin idea.
Maybe he's obsessed
with my past.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.840
And now you're
talking about
a seizure disorder...

14:46.928 --> 14:48.293
Which is also
not a toxin.

14:48.388 --> 14:52.347
But which is most likely
caused by an old injury
to the brain.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.470
Why do you see your past
as such a threat?

14:56.187 --> 14:57.973
Not only am I
unthreatened by it,

14:58.064 --> 14:59.144
l was trying
to get it back.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.147
There's a ding mark.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.859
It's a piece ofjunk.
It was dinged
when it came in.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.733
Sure. The cup marks,
the scuffs,

15:07.824 --> 15:09.030
and the paint,
and those three chips.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.402
This fourth one is new.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.485
I run a pawn shop,
not a storage company.
Do you want it or not?

15:14.539 --> 15:16.200
That should be it.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.575
You said you
pawned five books.
There's only four.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.456
That's all there is.

15:23.047 --> 15:26.164
Where's Approach to
the Acute Abdomen?

15:28.511 --> 15:29.591
Sold it.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.545
To?
I can't tell you.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.380
It's the law,
and it should be.

15:34.475 --> 15:37.842
Crazy bastards like you
try to hunt down their stuff.

15:40.523 --> 15:41.683
How much for the pile?

15:47.363 --> 15:48.478
You said it was junk.

15:48.573 --> 15:51.280
No, no.
It's yourjunk,
you want it.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.153
$500.
Take it or leave it.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.369
Why is it so important
that you get
your stuff back?

16:05.590 --> 16:07.546
Unlike
the rest of humanity,

16:07.633 --> 16:10.215
who's okay when their
belongings are taken?

16:10.344 --> 16:12.255
Everyone wants their stuff.
That's why it's their stuff.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.473
Everyone doesn't
pay five times
what it's worth.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.720
I like my stuff.
I hate it when
Wilson moves...

16:17.810 --> 16:18.890
Oh.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.598
This is not
about Wilson!

16:32.700 --> 16:33.860
Say it.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.196
(LAUGHS)

16:41.751 --> 16:43.867

say anything.

And hike!

17:18.246 --> 17:20.237
NOLAN: Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.617
You seriously thought
you're gonna tell me
that Wilson showed up,

17:22.708 --> 17:23.823
but not tell me
what he said?

17:23.918 --> 17:25.408
Because I thought
you were a smart guy

17:25.503 --> 17:27.459
who didn't
need the obvious
spelled out to him.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.796
Wilson noticed
that I didn't come
to my office all day.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.043
He came to find me.

17:32.134 --> 17:35.046
Wanted to
make sure I'm okay.
Bonng,bonng,bonng.

That's very sad, Alvie.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.115

an immigration hearing.

end up in jail.

18:11.841 --> 18:13.047
about other
people's emotions,

18:13.134 --> 18:15.671
but your actions
indicate otherwise.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.757
You dismiss Alvie's story
about his mother,

18:18.848 --> 18:20.588
but you cared enough
to schedule a hearing.

18:20.683 --> 18:23.174
I cared
for eight seconds.

I think she's at
an earlier stage

she's looking at
her grownup future,
and it puts her to sleep.

If he just bored her,
she'd hide it to be polite.

in therapy for a year.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.792
You know when | ask you
to talk about anything,

21:33.876 --> 21:35.741
I mean anything
that affects you.

21:36.045 --> 21:39.788
What upset you,
what made you mad,
or relieved, orjoyful.

21:39.882 --> 21:43.545
You want me to believe
that this case
means nothing?

21:45.554 --> 21:46.714
Then

21:50.267 --> 21:51.552
why should I
listen to it?

22:12.540 --> 22:14.155
Are you charging me
for this time?

22:14.250 --> 22:15.365
Yes.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.751
This is ridiculous.

22:22.049 --> 22:25.007
What's that?
On the back of your arm?

22:27.930 --> 22:30.046
It's just a bruise.
I fell.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.347
You remember falling?

22:33.686 --> 22:35.722
No. lwas drunk.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.269
Hence the balance issues.

22:38.357 --> 22:42.020
It looks like
you fell on the tip
of someone's boot.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.613
I said something that
someone objected to.

22:52.079 --> 22:53.364
Well, if you
don't remember,
then how...

22:53.455 --> 22:56.788
It's usually the way it is
when someone hits me.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.374
People who kick when
you're down are jerks,

22:59.461 --> 23:01.713
but they're generally
not irrational jerks.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.209
You got drunk enough
to get into a bar fight
and not remember,

23:04.300 --> 23:07.508
and you've been insisting
that everything's fine?

23:08.596 --> 23:10.757
Why go out and
get blind drunk?

23:10.848 --> 23:12.384
Were you looking
for a fight?

23:14.059 --> 23:15.390
I don't know.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.230
What have
you screwed up?

23:22.318 --> 23:23.398
What?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.567
You say that
when you've been
hit in the past,

23:25.654 --> 23:28.487
it's because you've
provoked it with
something that you said.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.565
Which means you're
well aware of the risks.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.615
So, on some level,
you were in that bar

23:32.703 --> 23:35.069
looking for someone
to hurt you.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.495
Logically,
people punish themselves
for something they did,

23:39.585 --> 23:41.701
or something
they didn't do.

23:43.088 --> 23:46.330
So, what did
you screw up?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.090
I don't know.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.027
Okay, there may be
a problem.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.370
All right.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.122
Let's talk
about Wilson.

24:22.920 --> 24:26.333
I told him your book
was contaminated
with anthrax spores.

24:26.423 --> 24:29.586
Then I gave him $300.
The address of the buyer.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.219
Maybe I was hasty
in asking you to move out.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.975
Why don't you stay
with me and Sam
for a little while?

24:37.059 --> 24:38.720
There's no need
to hurry things.

24:39.645 --> 24:41.385
What prompted this?

24:42.564 --> 24:46.807
Look, the whole idea
was that after Mayfield,
you wouldn't be on your own.

24:46.902 --> 24:48.483
I can touch base with
you a lot more easily

24:48.570 --> 24:49.980
if you're staying
with me than...

24:50.072 --> 24:51.482
For God's sake, Wilson.

24:51.740 --> 24:55.232
You really span the chasm
from wishy to washy.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.911
If you're gonna be an ass,
be an ass. Stick with it.

24:59.415 --> 25:01.155
Why were you being
so hard on the guy,

25:01.250 --> 25:02.581
when he was
being conciliatory?

25:02.668 --> 25:07.913
Come on,
Cuddy played on his guilt.
She put him up to this.

25:08.007 --> 25:09.497
How do you know that?

25:09.591 --> 25:11.843
How do you know
this wasn't entirely
his own idea?

25:11.927 --> 25:14.669
Two reasons.
First, he wants to create

25:14.763 --> 25:16.674
the perfect environment
to be with Sam.

25:16.974 --> 25:19.511
He's been thinking about
asking me to leave
for a while.

25:19.601 --> 25:23.059
Finally, he does it,
and immediately turns around
and changes his mind?

25:23.147 --> 25:24.432
No. He talked
to somebody.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.646
Maybe it was Sam.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.983
HOUSE: Yeah,
that’s a possibility.

25:30.904 --> 25:34.772
I want this to be
the last serious
relationship I ever have.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.357
I want this
to be the one.

25:36.452 --> 25:37.567
Me, too.

25:41.582 --> 25:44.870
Where's House?
It's not as meaningful
without him.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.914
Okay, not Sam.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.875
That still doesn't
answer why Cuddy.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.672
Because they've
been talking about me.

25:53.177 --> 25:55.338
She called me to
check on the patient,

25:55.429 --> 25:57.590
which she never does
without a reason.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.342
| asked why,
and she said...

25:59.433 --> 26:01.719
She's a barracuda
attorney, House.

26:01.810 --> 26:03.971
These are
the kind of patients
we like to keep happy.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.599
Right now,
the patient's lucky

26:05.689 --> 26:07.680
if she can spell
"jurisprudence."

26:07.775 --> 26:10.892
CUDDY: Yeah,
but when she gets
that memory back,

26:10.986 --> 26:12.317
which we're trying
to make happen,

26:12.404 --> 26:16.192
she'll be able to
spell "lawsuit."
I'm just touching base.

26:17.826 --> 26:22.365
"Touching base."
Wilson used exactly
the same phrase.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.910
Colluding about me is
their favorite pastime.

26:26.210 --> 26:28.292
Okay, you think
they talked.

26:30.672 --> 26:33.379
How do you think
that conversation went?

26:37.054 --> 26:39.010
WILSON: I'm worried
about House.

26:41.016 --> 26:44.179
Me, too.
Couldn't you have waited?

26:44.686 --> 26:48.554
It's way too early for
him to be on his own,
back in the old apartment.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.059
What makes you think
he can handle it?

26:50.150 --> 26:51.651
I offered to find
him a new place.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.111
You have to let him
back into your condo.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.981
Sam and ljust got
him out of the condo.

26:55.114 --> 26:58.072
You know what House is like,
he's self-destructive.
(MOUTHING)

26:58.158 --> 26:59.398
Without
constant supervision,

26:59.493 --> 27:01.950
he's gonna slide
back into drugs.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.904
If you're not
watching him,
I've got to.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.124
Yeah.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.286
So they don't
trust you.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.869
They assume you'll fail.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.205
Are these
their fears or yours?

27:15.634 --> 27:16.669
(CHUCKUNG)

27:16.760 --> 27:19.877
Let's turn on
the lights. Hmm?

27:21.807 --> 27:23.297
In your brain.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.217
Maybe they did
talk about you,

27:27.771 --> 27:30.854
but how do you know
it didn't happen
like this?

27:31.775 --> 27:32.890
I'm worried
about House.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.020
VVhy?

27:34.111 --> 27:35.897
It's the first time
he'll be on his
own since Mayfield.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.486
No, you're being
over-protective.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.655
House doesn't need to be
wrapped in cotton wool.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.733
But you know that,
or you wouldn't have
asked him to move out.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.615
Okay. I guess this
is really about me.

27:45.706 --> 27:48.072
It's just I feel
like a jerk.

27:48.750 --> 27:51.992
Sure, Sam and I
are gonna wanna be
on our own eventually,

27:52.671 --> 27:54.753
but I kind of
sprang this on him.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.421
The right way
would've been
tojust tell him

27:56.508 --> 27:57.497
to take as long
as he needed,

27:57.593 --> 27:59.504
that there's no hurry.

27:59.970 --> 28:03.053
So it's not what you did,
but how you did it?

28:03.140 --> 28:06.758
That matters
in a friendship.
I need to fix this.

28:07.311 --> 28:10.599
Why don't you talk to him
about moving back in?

28:11.315 --> 28:12.771
Just touch base.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.733
We're having
a consent issue
with the patient.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.856
Wait a minute.
Taub's not here.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.027
Yeah, he is.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.776
We're having
a consent issue
with the patient.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.574
What's Taub doing in
my imaginary version

28:24.661 --> 28:25.696
of a scene with
Wilson and Cuddy?

28:25.787 --> 28:28.403
Your version
needed to be ended.
Because it's crap.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.534
It's all sweetness
and light and faith

28:30.626 --> 28:31.786
that I'm gonna choose
the right path.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.204
Yeah, that sounds
like Wilson.

28:34.296 --> 28:35.832
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

28:36.632 --> 28:37.917
(RAIN PATTERING)

28:38.008 --> 28:41.592
I have as much
evidence for mine
as you do for yours.

28:41.678 --> 28:43.464
I know Wilson's
your friend,

28:43.555 --> 28:46.718
so he could be wondering
if he did right by you.

28:46.808 --> 28:47.934
And I know he wouldn't
have asked you

28:48.018 --> 28:49.098
to move out in
the first place

28:49.186 --> 28:51.427
unless he was convinced
you could handle life
on your own.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.433
And I know that
he and Cuddy have gone
behind my back before

28:54.524 --> 28:57.516
to strategize about
"the House problem."

28:57.611 --> 28:59.772
So there's truth
in both versions.

28:59.863 --> 29:01.603
But you choose to
focus on the parts

29:01.698 --> 29:04.155
that make you
uncomfortable. So...

29:10.540 --> 29:15.660
Why are you and
Wilson friends?

29:18.966 --> 29:22.424
Do you think this friendship
is the best you can do?

29:23.178 --> 29:26.011
Wilson is not
a consolation prize.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.589
There,
you're defending him.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.595
And a minute ago,
he was skulking around
in the background

29:30.686 --> 29:33.302
like some sort of
manipulative Iago.

29:34.815 --> 29:36.055
He's my friend.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.440
So what do you
value in him?

29:43.991 --> 29:47.734
I can say
whatever I want to him,
and he'll never leave.

29:47.828 --> 29:49.659
He's sort of leaving.

29:49.871 --> 29:52.453
At least, he won't
be around as much.

29:54.042 --> 29:57.079
Because he's
putting Sam first.

29:57.254 --> 29:58.494
For now.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.581
After the divorce,
he'll probably ask me
to move in again.

30:02.676 --> 30:04.212
I take the long view.

30:06.096 --> 30:07.336
You say that to Wilson?

30:07.431 --> 30:08.420
Are you kidding?

30:08.515 --> 30:11.848
That's the kind of remark
that leads people
to hit you.

30:15.731 --> 30:17.141
Maybe you've been right
from the beginning.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.312
(LAUGHING)

30:18.400 --> 30:19.810
Maybe this isn't
about Wilson.

30:22.195 --> 30:24.186
You say that now
that I finally
agree with you?

30:24.281 --> 30:26.317
Do you just argue
the opposite of
whatever I say?

30:26.408 --> 30:29.195
I don't mean
the Wilson thing
doesn't bother you.

30:29.286 --> 30:30.822
But it sounds like
he's the closest

30:30.912 --> 30:32.652
you could come to
a safe relationship.

30:32.748 --> 30:35.364
You'd have to do
something major
to screw it up.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.996
What else have you
been involved in
this week?

30:40.756 --> 30:42.587
What would you want to
punish yourself for?

30:44.384 --> 30:46.420
I told you
I don't know.

30:48.722 --> 30:51.589
Okay, let's approach it
from a different angle.

30:52.059 --> 30:57.599
Have you gotten
any other people angry
at you over anything?

30:58.774 --> 31:02.312
VVeH,yeah.
That's why I called it
an ordinary week.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.897
Okay. Tell me about it.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.032
JAY: You'd be losing
a part of your brain.

31:15.123 --> 31:18.331
It is my brain.
Why is it not
my right to consent?

31:19.336 --> 31:22.328
I'm sorry, but I'll
take this to court,
if necessary, all right?

31:22.422 --> 31:25.164
Sidney's in no position
to make decisions
about herself right now.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.589
She doesn't even
know who she is.

31:26.676 --> 31:29.543
I read your consent form
and I understood it.
I want the surgery.

31:29.638 --> 31:30.753
JAY: Why wouldn't she?

31:30.847 --> 31:33.884
Of course she's willing
to risk losing her
memories permanently,

31:33.975 --> 31:37.058
she has no idea
how important
those memories are.

31:37.145 --> 31:38.931
Does she even know
what "risk" is?

31:39.022 --> 31:40.558
She's never
lost anything!

31:40.649 --> 31:43.436
Without the surgery,
she'll lose everything.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.438
The prion infection
will continue to advance

31:45.529 --> 31:46.735
and destroy
her whole brain.

31:46.822 --> 31:49.029
There has to
be another way.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.197
Please.

31:53.787 --> 31:55.448
I'm speaking
for my wife,

31:55.831 --> 31:57.321
the wife I lived with
for four years,

31:57.416 --> 32:00.203
who isn't here and
can't defend herself.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.043
Dr. House,
are you listening?

32:03.713 --> 32:07.501
Well, you can stop arguing
'cause it doesn't matter
anymore.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.386
Look at the variability
in the heart rate.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.756
The SE's spread
into the brainstem.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.551
Wherever it is,
you can still cut it out.

32:17.144 --> 32:20.602
No. We can't
cut the brainstem.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.054
HOUSE: This thing's
moving too quickly.

32:22.149 --> 32:24.435
Surgery is
no longer an option.

32:24.526 --> 32:27.518
Which, I guess,
means you've won.
Congratulations.

32:28.572 --> 32:31.029
Put in a pacer,
and start her on
chemo and radiation.

32:31.116 --> 32:33.232
It won't cure her,
but it'll buy
a couple weeks,

32:33.326 --> 32:35.703
so she can find out
who she is
before she dies.

32:38.707 --> 32:40.197
NOLAN:
That was pretty rough.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.533
Do you always break the news
to your patients that way?

32:42.752 --> 32:45.334
Or were you
shorthanding it for me?

32:45.422 --> 32:47.458
Husband was
being an idiot.

32:47.549 --> 32:49.005
Well, he was
asking for it.

32:50.218 --> 32:53.585
But to punish him,
you had to punish
the wife, too.

32:53.847 --> 32:55.803
Why did he make you
so angry?

32:55.891 --> 32:58.849
Because he didn't want
to cooperate with you?

32:59.603 --> 33:02.970
He'd rather risk
his wife's life
than their marriage.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.643
People's brains
stop working
when they think

33:05.734 --> 33:07.270
they're gonna lose
someone they love.

Your leg hurting?

33:14.326 --> 33:15.532
It's all right.

33:16.411 --> 33:17.571
Okay.

33:18.371 --> 33:19.656

you pissed off?

(LAWN MOWER WHIRRING)

33:28.256 --> 33:29.837
Fifty bucks
for the book.

33:29.925 --> 33:31.085
Forget it.

33:31.927 --> 33:34.213
You paid $25.
That's 100% return.

33:34.304 --> 33:35.384
That's what I paid.

33:35.472 --> 33:38.214
But it's a rare
surgical text,
nearly 100 years old,

33:38.308 --> 33:42.677
plates in mint condition.
That book's worth
several thousand dollars.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.932
$2,000.
I'll write you a check.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.058
Nice try.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.526
Face it. I had
the wit to recognize

33:48.610 --> 33:50.441
something valuable
when I saw it.

33:50.529 --> 33:55.819
In the great Darwinian race,
I get my just reward,
you become roadkill.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.545
Yo, House, you wanna
stop by the library?

34:10.632 --> 34:11.792
'Cause I got
a book to return.

Anyone see you?

34:19.391 --> 34:21.052
Yeah, Prof saw me
walking down the driveway.

34:21.142 --> 34:22.882
He said the roses
need more fertilizer.

34:22.978 --> 34:23.967
(ENGINE STARTING)

34:29.150 --> 34:32.642
I didn't know there was
a section of the brain
just for hope.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.398
It's very, very tiny.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.731
We used fluoroscopy to
guide pacemaker placement
in the patient's heart.

34:37.826 --> 34:38.986
Hello.

34:40.120 --> 34:43.612
Hello.
Rapidly progressive

34:43.707 --> 34:45.197
This isn't SE,
and whatever it is,

34:45.292 --> 34:46.372
it's notjust
in her brain,

34:46.459 --> 34:47.915
it's attacking
her whole body.

34:48.003 --> 34:51.621
You work for House?
I guess we're teammates.
Isn't that cool?

34:52.507 --> 34:53.667
Hello.

34:54.968 --> 34:56.003
Juan Alvarez?

34:56.094 --> 34:57.083
What the hell?

34:57.178 --> 34:59.794
We're taking you
into custody.
Deportation order.

34:59.889 --> 35:02.380
I'm a citizen.
You're disrespecting
Puerto Rico.

35:02.475 --> 35:05.342
If you're a citizen,
why did you miss

35:07.897 --> 35:09.683
You called them?

35:15.363 --> 35:16.944
What's going on?

35:27.584 --> 35:29.074
We're trying to
stabilize her heart.

35:29.169 --> 35:30.659
She's still tachy
and hypotensive.

Slow-moving infection

to her brain.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.919
I'm not talking to you.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.180
How could you
turn me in?

35:44.267 --> 35:46.178
CHASE: Her extreme exercise
suppresses her immune system,

35:46.269 --> 35:47.850
allows the infection
to smoulder.

35:47.937 --> 35:51.179
HOUSE: Or allows
an old infection
to re-activate. TB.

35:52.442 --> 35:54.307
Start her on
a multi-drug regimen.

I don't like you, House.
I hate you.

will take time to work.

A gentle reminder,
the use of cell phones
is prohibited.

36:03.745 --> 36:06.487
Give her the first dose
directly into the lungs
in the OR.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.617
Before the less-gentle
arrest for contempt.

36:08.708 --> 36:10.664
Put her in an isolation
room with UV light.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.915
And get yourselves tested.
You've all been exposed.

You are?

of Juan Alvarez.

36:43.660 --> 36:46.197
My mother's DNA was
still on that cross?

36:46.287 --> 36:47.447
It could be.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.830
You faked it?

36:54.045 --> 36:56.878
It wasn't just me.
You lied to them, too.

36:56.965 --> 36:59.672
But I'm better at it
than you are.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.630
(RAPPING) I’m gonna re-paint

02 sats are dropping.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.511
We may need to tube her.
Grab some IV furosemide.

37:16.192 --> 37:17.773
Wait. Wait.

37:17.861 --> 37:18.896
She's crashing.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.147
CHASE: We need to
get her on a vent.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.281
There's something
on her ankle.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.289
FOREMAN: A tattoo.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.543
"Eddie would go."
It's a surfing phrase.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.339
Must be from
her earlier life.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.210
She tried to
get it removed.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.091
But they only took off
the top layers of skin.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.888
The ink is still in
the deeper layers.

37:49.309 --> 37:50.845
It set off
an allergic reaction.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.851
She was fine
until she started
the long-distance running.

37:53.938 --> 37:56.395
The ultra-marathoning
modified her immune system

37:56.524 --> 37:58.810
and set off
the allergic reaction.

37:58.902 --> 38:02.770
We did
a full-thickness skin graft
and she'll be okay.

38:04.532 --> 38:09.196
So, you were right
in the end.
It was her past.

38:10.872 --> 38:12.453
Did she get
her memory back?

HOUSE: Not yet.

NOLAN: Will she?

38:17.670 --> 38:19.126
No way to know.

38:19.214 --> 38:21.170
SIDNEY: I think roses
are my favorite.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.959
But I guess
I told you that
at some point.

38:25.053 --> 38:26.668
I don't remember.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.469
(BOTH LAUGHING)

38:29.390 --> 38:31.802
NOLAN: He's treating her
as though they've just met.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.978
He's courting her.
Whose idea was that?

38:38.817 --> 38:40.398
He was doing
the opposite of
everything he should,

38:40.485 --> 38:41.565
suddenly he's changed.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.813
Taub thought
it might...

38:42.904 --> 38:44.644
That was your idea.

38:44.906 --> 38:48.194
And you asked me
what I thought was
going on between them.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.366
It's their relationship
that's on your mind.

38:50.453 --> 38:52.489
That's why you've
been thinking about
this case.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.081

38:54.165 --> 38:56.747
Lost one with Wilson,
gained one with Alvie...

NOLAN: You gonna tell me
what the note said?

39:27.699 --> 39:31.408
Alvie was very grateful
that I'd gotten him
out of trouble.

39:31.661 --> 39:33.526
It allowed him to go stay
with his cousin in Phoenix

39:33.621 --> 39:37.205
without worrying
about Immigration
looking for him there.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.579
You didn't think
he was gonna
stay forever?

39:40.670 --> 39:41.750
No.

39:43.464 --> 39:45.204
What happened next?

39:50.805 --> 39:52.670

you want me to say?

I don't know,
you're the one
who set the theme.

Something
about relationships

40:37.352 --> 40:39.092
made you go out
and provoke a fight.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.887
Wilson and Sam
have a relationship.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.561
You're not thrilled
about it.

40:45.652 --> 40:46.892
They're happy.

40:48.404 --> 40:52.022
Why should
I screw that up?
Everyone's happy.

Wilson and Sam,
Cuddy and Lucas,
even Alvie and his...

40:59.499 --> 41:01.785
Cuddy and Lucas are
moving in together?

41:02.293 --> 41:03.829
You didn't mention that.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.956
They've talked about
moving in together before.

41:06.047 --> 41:08.038
It's not big news.

to your Cuddy?

Her great-grandfather.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.700
I've had it for years.

41:46.254 --> 41:49.121
Always meant to
give it to her
for a special occasion.

41:50.049 --> 41:51.914
Like her housewarming?

41:52.677 --> 41:54.292
It's just a gift.

41:54.721 --> 41:57.428
A woman you care about
has taken one step
further away from you

41:57.515 --> 41:59.597
and closer
to someone else.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.174
I think I can
safely say, yes,

42:01.269 --> 42:03.385
it's significant
if you don't mention it.

42:03.479 --> 42:06.221
You were willing to
punish the husband
of your patient

42:06.315 --> 42:08.647
because you identified
with him.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.519
He was also losing
someone he loved.

42:12.613 --> 42:13.989
I'm not gonna go out
and get hammered

42:14.073 --> 42:17.065
because a woman
I'm not even with is
moving in with someone.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.946
That'd be pathetic.

42:21.622 --> 42:23.283

42:26.461 --> 42:27.621
When I first
came to you,

42:28.546 --> 42:31.208
I told you that
I wanted to be happy.

42:31.299 --> 42:35.633
I followed your advice,
and instead I'm
just miserable.

42:36.345 --> 42:38.472
How is this
working for me?

42:38.931 --> 42:41.013
It takes time.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.591
For a year,
I've done everything
you've asked,

42:43.686 --> 42:45.802
and everybody else
is happy.

42:46.355 --> 42:49.518
I run my treadmill,
you just sit there
and watch.

42:50.777 --> 42:52.642
You're a faith healer.

42:53.613 --> 42:56.821
You take advantage
of people who want
to believe.

42:59.702 --> 43:02.535
But there's nothing
in your bag of tricks.

43:04.832 --> 43:05.992

Whatever the answer is,
you don't have it.
