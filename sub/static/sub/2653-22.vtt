00:02.336 --> 00:05.044
Oh, New Yorker, you've done it again.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.608
Jay, check out this cartoon.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.551
- Does it have a talking dog?
- No, it's a commentary-

00:08.609 --> 00:09.883
I'm out.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.652
Here you go. One of my best efforts.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.420
- Have at it.
- I can't eat that.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.792
- Why not?
- The pickle's touching it.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.192
- There.
- The juice got on the bread and-

00:20.254 --> 00:21.756
Eew! What's that stuff?

00:21.822 --> 00:24.200
- Spices.
- They look like Sea-Monkeys.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.932
Have you ever really examined
a jar of pickles, Jay?

00:26.994 --> 00:28.905
It's like a swamp in there. I'll pass.

00:28.963 --> 00:31.705
- What happened?
- I made him a beautiful sandwich, and he won't eat it.

00:31.766 --> 00:33.905
Yeah, 'cause it had pickles on it.

00:33.968 --> 00:36.209
Joe is taking a nap.
I'm gonna go to the dry cleaners.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.216
- Well, if you're passing a sushi restaurant-
- She's not.

00:38.272 --> 00:42.687
- I've never heard of anyone not liking pickles.
- Aw, big day for you then.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.654
I'm just gonna make myself
a grilled cheese.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.988
I think I saw some Gruyère in there.
Do we have any fig?

00:47.048 --> 00:48.391
Uh-uh. Sit down.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.259
This whole persnickety thing
is not gonna fly in the world.

00:51.318 --> 00:54.197
Never hand people another reason
to make fun of you.

00:54.255 --> 00:57.828
You mean like all the cool kids
with their leather jackets and their pickles?

00:57.892 --> 01:02.136
Well, you're gonna sit there
until you at least try a pickle.

01:02.196 --> 01:05.200
- You're drunk with power.
- You got that right.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.510
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:09.570 --> 01:11.709
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:11.772 --> 01:13.683
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:13.741 --> 01:15.846
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:15.910 --> 01:17.014
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:20.781 --> 01:22.283
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:22.349 --> 01:24.056
The Tonys are coming.

01:24.118 --> 01:27.122
This is exactly why I don't want you
watching them. You're already so angry.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.690
Not that Tonys.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.326
Anthony Lamarque. Botox Tony.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.564
- They're coming to the wedding.
- Oh.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.869
But, seriously, another revival
of Anything Goes?

01:35.930 --> 01:37.432
Are we really doing this again?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.000
I'm surprised that they're coming...

01:39.066 --> 01:40.807
because when I mentioned
the wedding to Tony...

01:40.868 --> 01:42.541
he seemed completely disinter-

01:42.603 --> 01:44.514
Oh! The Botox.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.074
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:46.140 --> 01:48.142
Your cousin Pete.
All of his kids.

01:48.209 --> 01:49.882
Everyone's accepting, Mitchell!

01:49.944 --> 01:52.015
We haven't even gotten the list
from my dad yet.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.116
And your dad's friends
drink like soldiers...

01:54.181 --> 01:55.751
because they were soldiers.

01:55.816 --> 01:58.023
I mean, I am grateful
for their service...

01:58.085 --> 02:00.190
but we are not gonna be able
to afford this wedding.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.894
- Maybe we need to pull back on a few things.
- Like what?

02:02.957 --> 02:04.834
Uh, the centerpieces?

02:04.892 --> 02:06.735
Why even have a wedding?

02:06.794 --> 02:10.071
I don't know. Because we love and respect
each other and we're raising a child together.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.633
Do you want to help or not?

02:11.699 --> 02:14.077
Maybe we could send "un-vitations."
Is that a thing?

02:14.135 --> 02:16.775
We've already made a lot of people angry
by just being able to get married.

02:16.837 --> 02:19.340
Let's not alienate the ones on our side.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.113
Maybe we could sell something.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.677
We're thousands over budget.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.620
It would have to be something great.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.282
Here, you can sell my diamond ring.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.088
Oh, honey, that's candy.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.758
I'm gonna kill that Jackson.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.354
I do have something of value-

02:33.420 --> 02:35.593
a Spider-Man vs. Dr. Octopus comic book.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.034
Issue number 3, 1963.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.594
Near-mint condition.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.435
It's worth five grand.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.668
I traded a football for it
when I was nine years old...

02:43.731 --> 02:45.233
and my dad was mad...

02:45.299 --> 02:48.109
because the football
was signed by Dan Marino.

02:48.169 --> 02:50.240
I said, "Get it signed by Rita Moreno...

02:50.304 --> 02:51.806
and I'll keep it."

02:51.872 --> 02:55.479
Oh, no. My nephews are flying in from Tulsa-
the big ones.

02:55.543 --> 02:58.990
- The pie eaters?
- That's it. I gotta sell my Wyatt Earp.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.787
This here is a belt buckle...

03:00.848 --> 03:03.328
once worn by the great Wyatt Earp.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.421
My grandpa gave it to me
when I was seven years old...

03:05.486 --> 03:08.990
and he said,
"Son, this will keep the bad guys away."

03:09.056 --> 03:13.163
In my early 20s, I wore it
to a cowboys-and-Indians disco party.

03:13.227 --> 03:16.504
And let's just say it didn't.

03:16.564 --> 03:19.067
No. I can't let you do that.
That means the world to you.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.135
Cam, I will sell my Spider-Man.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.875
Mitchell, my belt buckle was owned...

03:22.937 --> 03:24.507
by a legend of the Old West.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.416
I don't think your comic book
would even cover our balloon budget.

03:27.474 --> 03:30.944
That's very of fens- Wait.
What's the balloon budget?

03:33.647 --> 03:36.093
Hey, Mom,
can we put this stuff somewhere else?

03:36.150 --> 03:38.096
- It's cluttering up my room.
- What is it?

03:38.152 --> 03:41.258
Oh, just some mementos of mine.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.824
A few of your dad's.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.063
- Oh! Zima!
- Yeah.

03:45.125 --> 03:47.696
- What's Zima?
- Just a party in a bottle.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.708
Man, that reminds me of some wild times.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.334
Cranking the Björk in my Saturn...

03:52.399 --> 03:55.312
before me and my buddies snuck some "Z"
into Sleepless in Seattle.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.645
I wish you'd cover my ears for that.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.810
Ooh, Mom. Who's this hottie
with his arm around you?

03:59.873 --> 04:01.318
Cute!

04:01.375 --> 04:03.651
Oh, that's Bobby Nash, my old boyfriend.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.691
Why'd you break up with him? For Dad?

04:05.746 --> 04:08.386
Let's just say he took his eye off the ball
and struck out.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.894
- Hmm.
- So I stepped up to the plate...

04:09.950 --> 04:11.395
and nailed her in the cheap seats.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.160
- Yeah, let's not say that.
- Well, I'm off.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.565
Oh, honey, I've gotta stop by the drugstore.
Do you need anything?

04:16.624 --> 04:19.969
No, thank you, my dear. The Dunphy glands
produce all the drugs I need.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.700
- Mm-hmm.
- Except for, uh, foot spray.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.504
- Could you grab me some of that?
- Sure.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.704
Wow, Mom!

04:26.767 --> 04:28.508
What a dork, right?

04:28.569 --> 04:30.776
- What were you thinking?
- it was comfortable.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.648
My dad didn't approve. Enough said.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.178
I know it's hard to believe...

04:36.243 --> 04:39.053
but I was actually
a bit of a nerd back in the day...

04:39.113 --> 04:41.957
and it was suggested that I was
out of my league when I landed Claire.

04:42.016 --> 04:43.518
By Jay, mostly.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.655
And my friends. A-And my parents.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.157
And Claire.

04:48.222 --> 04:50.259
What's this?

04:50.324 --> 04:51.826
Oh, my gosh.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.566
That is your father's
answering machine from college. Wow.

04:54.628 --> 04:58.201
God, I sometimes forget
how old you guys are.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.869
♪ You've reached Phil's world!♪

04:59.933 --> 05:01.844
♪ Party time! Excellent!♪

05:01.902 --> 05:03.404
Schwing!

05:03.470 --> 05:05.074
He's so cute.

05:05.139 --> 05:08.313
Hi, Phil. This is Mitchell, uh, Pritchett,
Claire's brother.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.652
I just wanted to thank you
for setting me up with your cousin.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.783
She was very nice.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.417
- Ooh.
- The only problem is...

05:15.482 --> 05:18.053
she lives kinda far, so-

05:18.118 --> 05:20.428
That's the only problem?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.023
Hey, Dunph-dog it's Ling

05:22.089 --> 05:24.035
Grab your rollerblades
and meet us at the bike path, playa!

05:24.091 --> 05:27.163
But I gotta be done by 3:00, 'cause today's
the day I'm flyin' my new helicopter.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.707
Phil? Hey, it's Claire.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.834
Um- I need to tell you something..

05:31.899 --> 05:34.072
And I don't want to do it
on your machine.

05:34.134 --> 05:37.377
- It's really important. Life and death important.
- No, no. No, no.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.247
- Come on. Come on.
- Not death. Um, just life.

05:39.306 --> 05:41.684
I mean-
Oh, hell, I'm pregnant!

05:41.742 --> 05:43.312
Ah! Sweet newlyweds!

05:43.377 --> 05:45.186
Don't worry,
You don't have to marry me or anything

05:45.245 --> 05:48.317
Let's talk as soon as you can.
Why weren't we more careful?

05:48.382 --> 05:50.328
Stupid Duran Duran concert

05:50.384 --> 05:52.591
All right! That's enough.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.065
I was conceived
at a Duran Duran concert?

05:55.122 --> 05:56.897
Classy start to a classy life.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.961
You were not conceived at the concert.
It was after the concert.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.633
- In the car?
- It was a very nice car.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.836
Listen, I am done.
Stop snooping. I'm going.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.211
The seats folded all the way back.

06:09.269 --> 06:10.771
Oh! images.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.818
- Can't believe they kept it.
- I have a name.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.183
- The answering machine.
- Oh.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.745
You know, we could
have some fun with this.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.659
- I'm home!
- Hi, Mom.

06:21.715 --> 06:25.390
Manny, what are you doing
sitting in front of a pickle?

06:25.452 --> 06:27.728
Jay says I can't leave until I taste it.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.825
Why do you torture him like this?

06:29.890 --> 06:33.394
'Cause he's too stuck in his ways, Gloria.
This is good for him.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.771
He'll taste the pickle, he'll find that
he likes it, he'll try more things.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.537
This is good parenting.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.510
This is not going to play well
in my memoir.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.945
You know, you're one to talk.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.882
How many times have I asked you
to try my mother's blood sausages?

06:45.939 --> 06:47.384
Totally different. That's disgusting.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.614
How do you know it's disgusting
if you've never tried it?

06:49.676 --> 06:54.989
You've never tried Grandma's delicious
blood sausage that's right there in the freezer?

06:55.048 --> 06:57.858
Oh, you're right.
We do have some leftovers.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.955
Really? it hasn't been
all gobbled up yet?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.832
Okay, Mr. Father of the Year...

07:02.890 --> 07:07.566
it's time for you to show Manny
that you're not a hypocrite.

07:08.695 --> 07:10.697
Looks like you're in quite a conundrum.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.903
- You know, you could've said-
- "A pickle"! Dang it!

07:12.966 --> 07:14.570
It was right there.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.719
- Hello.
- Hi. Can I help you?

07:23.777 --> 07:27.156
Uh, yes. I have something pretty special
that means the world to me.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.990
Yet I gladly part with it
to prove my love for my fiancé.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.121
- Cam, you don't have to-
- I do.

07:32.186 --> 07:36.828
This is a belt buckle that was once owned
by the legendary Wyatt Earp.

07:36.890 --> 07:40.269
And when my grandfather gave it to me,
God rest his soul, he said...

07:40.327 --> 07:43.069
"Son, this here is"-
Um-

07:43.130 --> 07:44.632
Okay?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.644
I can't be here for this. You do it.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.543
And get a price on that divine lamp.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.618
- Um, anyway-
- I didn't want to say anything in front of your fiancé...

07:53.674 --> 07:57.520
but this is a cheap replica
given away by a gas station chain in the '60s.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.889
There's tons of them out there.
It's worth about 20 bucks.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.086
Are you sure?

08:04.051 --> 08:06.895
- Pretty sure.
- Wow.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.730
That family loves to dress up a story.
And a pig.

08:09.790 --> 08:13.636
Well, how about a first-edition #3
Spider-Man Versus Dr. Octopus...

08:13.694 --> 08:15.401
in near-mint condition?

08:17.064 --> 08:18.475
Keep talking.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.136
That-

08:20.200 --> 08:22.271
Uh, that's pretty much it.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.116
Why isn't she calling?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.414
Aren't you the doubter?

08:28.475 --> 08:31.149
She'll call in three...

08:31.211 --> 08:33.087
two-

08:33.145 --> 08:34.784
- One! One's next!
- Yeah.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.759
Oh! Oh! Shh! Shh!

08:36.817 --> 08:37.955
Press "record."

08:39.352 --> 08:40.660
Hi, Mom.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.496
Haley, honey, did you mean to send
this text to your dad?

08:43.557 --> 08:45.059
Text? What does it say?

08:45.125 --> 08:48.971
Um- "I hate to spoil
your golf game, but"-

08:49.963 --> 08:52.375
Uh- No, no. I-I didn't send that.

08:52.432 --> 08:55.242
Must have accidentally dictated
when you and Dad were talking.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.009
Okay. That's weird.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.017
Well, while I have you on the phone,
would you mind emptying the dishwasher and-

09:00.073 --> 09:01.916
- Oh, you're breaking up.
- Haley?

09:01.975 --> 09:03.716
- Can you hear me now?
- Nope. Bye.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.586
- Got it.
- Told you we'd get it.

09:05.646 --> 09:08.490
Now just for a little creative editing.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.293
Your mind is so brilliant.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.332
If you put this much effort into your schoolwork,
there is no telling the things you could-

09:14.388 --> 09:15.958
Why do you have to ruin everything?

09:16.023 --> 09:18.970
I know!
She's always talking about my potential.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.137
Fore!

09:25.198 --> 09:27.644
- Do you think I hit her?
- Nah, she's fine.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.648
Sorry I'm so distracted today.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.206
What's wrong, buddy?

09:33.173 --> 09:34.880
Let me ask you something.

09:34.942 --> 09:37.616
Do you ever get the sense that your wife
feels like she could have done better?

09:37.678 --> 09:39.715
God, no.
She's the luckiest woman on Earth.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.726
If anything, I could've done better.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.625
The noises that
come out of that woman at night?

09:43.684 --> 09:46.096
- - it's like she's
that black guy from Police Academy

09:46.153 --> 09:47.689
Speak of the devil.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.234
A message from my wife,
not the black guy from Police Academy

09:50.290 --> 09:52.395
- Oh, that'd be so awesome.
- That would be neat.

09:52.459 --> 09:53.961
Hey, it's Claire.

09:54.027 --> 09:57.031
Um, I hate to spoil your golf game,
but... I'm pregnant!

09:57.097 --> 09:59.577
- What?
- Let's talk as soon as you can.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.306
I have to leave.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.143
What? We're in the middle of a game.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.807
I have to be with Claire!

10:04.871 --> 10:07.044
My clubs!

10:08.275 --> 10:09.845
My hat!

10:11.511 --> 10:13.081
My sandwich!

10:16.850 --> 10:18.830
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.592
I'm sorry I freaked out in there.

10:20.654 --> 10:23.760
- How much did we get for it?
- You know, here. I couldn't do it.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.566
- What?
- No. This belt buckle means so much to you.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.369
I'm just gonna-
I am going to sell my comic book instead.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.466
- Oh, Mitchell, that is so sweet.
- It's okay.

10:31.531 --> 10:34.137
The idea of me parting ways
with a belt buckle...

10:34.201 --> 10:37.011
that my grandfather
arm-wrestled Wyatt Earp for-

10:37.070 --> 10:38.879
He arm-wrestled him?

10:38.939 --> 10:41.715
Oh, yeah, but not in a contentious way.
You know, they were friends.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.880
My grandfather saved his life
during a train robbery.

10:43.944 --> 10:47.187
- A train robbery? That's- Wow. Cam, wow!
- Yeah.

10:47.247 --> 10:50.785
They had a real bond.
The great Wyatt Earp and Honest Abe Tucker.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.728
Mm-hmm.

10:52.786 --> 10:56.598
I have it, I'll store it,
and if I need to, I will use it.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.874
You know what? I quit.
Pardon me for trying to broaden his horizons.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.499
No, no, no.
You're not quitting anything.

11:04.564 --> 11:07.443
You're going to eat your sausage,
and you're going to eat your pickle.

11:07.501 --> 11:10.243
I am tired of every day
cooking two different meals.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.477
"No tomatoes."
"White meat only." "Extra bacon."

11:13.540 --> 11:15.383
He gets extra bacon? What the hell?

11:15.442 --> 11:18.480
Today is the day
you two are stopping this silliness.

11:18.545 --> 11:21.253
Fine. We'll all conquer something today.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.817
What do I have to conquer?
I eat everything.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.387
- Pet Stella's belly.
- What?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.330
You won't touch Stella's belly.

11:28.388 --> 11:32.268
Yeah, because it's the creepiest thing ever.
Has, like, 30 nipples.

11:32.325 --> 11:35.272
I'll eat the blood sausage,
Manny eats the pickles...

11:35.328 --> 11:36.830
you pet her belly.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.308
I'd rather eat the dog.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.140
Don't be a hypocrite.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.305
Nice and long, like you mean it.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.849
I want to see that leg shake.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.028
- Hey! What's happening?
- Oh! Let me get these!

11:57.084 --> 11:59.291
- I'm just so happy!
- Really?

11:59.352 --> 12:01.491
- Did you finally get a hole in one?
- "A hole in one."

12:01.555 --> 12:04.661
- I hope our baby has your sense of humor.
- Our what?

12:04.725 --> 12:08.036
Why didn't I see it? The drugstore, the
bloated ankles, you've been so moody lately.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.166
- What are you talking about?
- There it is.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.470
Phil, I am not pregnant.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.033
- You're not?
- No.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.943
- Why'd you leave me that message?
- Didn't leave you a message.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.776
You sure? You're very forgetful
when you're pregnant.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.340
- I think I would remember.
- Then why have you been so moody?

12:19.406 --> 12:21.579
Maybe because you just told me
I have giant ankles.

12:21.641 --> 12:23.552
Shh. I don't want him
to hear us fight like this.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.112
Give me this.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.028
Okay. This is gonna be good for everybody,
so let's get it over with.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.563
- Fine.
- Okay.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.462
We'll go on the count of three.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.195
One, two...

12:37.924 --> 12:39.403
three.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.974
- Oh, no!
- I'm gonna throw up!

12:43.029 --> 12:45.066
Why so moist, Jay? Why?

12:45.132 --> 12:48.272
Move!

12:48.335 --> 12:50.212
Is this a bad time?

12:53.473 --> 12:55.316
Sorry to barge in here like this.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.549
I guess it's weird that, uh,
I'm still storing stuff here.

12:58.612 --> 13:03.220
I just wish you would have come in sooner
before I went to second base with Stella.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.058
All right, I'll be two minutes.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.655
If you need money for the wedding,
why sell something that you love?

13:07.721 --> 13:10.201
- Why don't you just ask Jay?
- No. No, no, no.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.999
- Why not? He's your father.
- I don't feel right asking my dad for money.

13:13.059 --> 13:16.006
I'm an adult, and I have my comic book.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.841
I hate to spoil your golf game,
but... I'm pregnant!

13:19.900 --> 13:21.538
Let's talk as soon as you can.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.207
- Oh, they are good.
- I can't believe they pulled such an elaborate stunt.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.875
I don't know whether to be angry
or impressed.

13:25.939 --> 13:28.146
It's so diabolical.
I don't know where they get that fr-

13:28.208 --> 13:30.882
W-Wait.
We could really have some fun with this.

13:33.180 --> 13:36.684
- It's funny. I never saw you as a comic book guy.
- Oh, no, I wasn't.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.890
But I don't know-
Spider-Man, he spoke to me.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.456
I-i think it's because
it's about this nerdy kid...

13:42.522 --> 13:45.992
who has this special secret side of himself
that he can't share with anybody.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.039
And that's how I always felt.

13:48.094 --> 13:52.133
- Oh. - Spider-Man made me feel
like it was okay to be different.

13:52.199 --> 13:55.874
He made me feel tough enough
to get through the rough times.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.974
Oh, Mitchell, that's so sweet. I didn't know that.
Are you sure you want to sell it?

13:59.039 --> 14:02.282
Yes, yes. Because, like Spider-Man,
I am brave and strong.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.880
Spider web! Spider web!

14:04.945 --> 14:06.583
- My mouth!
- Mitchell!

14:06.646 --> 14:08.887
What- Oh! No! No!

14:08.949 --> 14:10.519
Oh, no.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.358
- Give me a break, Phil!
- What do you want from me?

14:17.424 --> 14:18.994
- Shh!
- I didn't say anything.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.437
A little compassion when you thought
I was pregnant would have been nice!

14:21.494 --> 14:22.996
- Uh-oh.
- I'm sorry.

14:23.063 --> 14:26.442
- It was a knee-jerk reaction.
- You got that half right!

14:26.499 --> 14:29.002
Well, you're not pregnant anyway,
so who cares?

14:29.069 --> 14:30.707
And what did I say that was so terrible?

14:30.770 --> 14:35.116
I believe your exact words were,
"Great! Another kid that we can screw up!"

14:35.175 --> 14:37.519
Oh, well, I'm sorry,
but we both know that's true!

14:37.577 --> 14:40.251
Wait! Are you saying we never
should have had them in the first place?

14:40.313 --> 14:41.815
Like you never said that?

14:41.882 --> 14:44.419
This is awful. Is this what you thought
was going to happen?

14:44.484 --> 14:47.693
I didn't think that far ahead. I never do.
You know that. You should've stopped me!

14:47.754 --> 14:51.031
You said this was going to be fun.
Nobody is having fun.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.593
Careful? Please, Phil!

14:52.659 --> 14:54.798
If you hadn't gotten me pregnant,
I never would have married you!

14:54.861 --> 14:56.363
I would have married Bobby Nash!

14:56.429 --> 14:57.772
- You would?
- Oh, yeah!

14:57.831 --> 15:01.040
And right now, I would be
on my 100-acre ranch in Aspen...

15:01.101 --> 15:03.638
with my strapping
6'4" hedge-fund husband.

15:03.703 --> 15:07.378
- You really wish you'd married Bobby?
- Oh, every single day!

15:11.411 --> 15:12.856
No. Phil.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.551
Dad, are you okay?

15:14.614 --> 15:17.493
Yep. That's what I am
to everyone around here.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.995
- Mom-
- Just "okay."

15:19.052 --> 15:20.554
- Phil!
- Hey, Mom?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.190
Not now. Phil.

15:23.223 --> 15:26.136
You guys hear that? We totally got 'em.

15:26.192 --> 15:30.197
- Quick! We need a blow dryer!
- Is this some sort of gay emergency?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.300
No, Dad, it's not a gay emergency.
It's my comic book.

15:32.365 --> 15:35.141
We need-
Oh, God! it's ruined!

15:35.201 --> 15:37.875
Mitchell, it's okay.
It probably wasn't worth that much anyway.

15:37.938 --> 15:41.511
It was worth $5,000! Your belt buckle is garbage.
It came from a gas station!

15:41.574 --> 15:44.487
Your grandfather never met Wyatt Earp!

15:44.544 --> 15:48.082
I didn't hold on to that
for quite as long as I thought.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.755
Hey, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to blurt it out like that.

15:51.818 --> 15:55.493
No, it's- it's okay. I kind of suspected
the dates didn't line up.

15:55.555 --> 15:59.093
- Now I'm starting to think that wasn't
Amelia Earhart's compass. - Well-

15:59.159 --> 16:02.902
I'm so sorry, but I am sure that Jay
can help you two out.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.409
No, no, no, no, no.
We want to do this on our own.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.411
Can I ask you a question?

16:07.467 --> 16:09.879
Why are you having
such a big thing anyway?

16:09.936 --> 16:12.177
Well, because we're only
getting married once.

16:12.238 --> 16:15.185
I'm just saying, why do you
need to make it into a spectacle?

16:15.241 --> 16:17.653
- A s- A spectacle?
- This could be the universe's way...

16:17.711 --> 16:19.554
of telling you to bring it down a notch.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.683
Invite your family, your friend Pepper.

16:21.748 --> 16:25.093
And what's his name-
th-th-the flouncy one. L'David.

16:25.151 --> 16:27.825
I don't have a flouncy friend
named L'David, Dad.

16:27.887 --> 16:30.959
Do you mean L'Michael or J'Marcus?
I'm not sure who you're referring to.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.197
Whatever.
I'm just saying keep it small.

16:33.259 --> 16:36.297
Why pay all that money
for people you barely know?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.400
- Oh, you mean like any of your friends?
- Oh, please.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.706
- You don't want any of my friends there.
- Really?

16:40.767 --> 16:42.713
Because I've been asking for a list
for months now.

16:42.769 --> 16:46.615
- So who doesn't want them there, me or you?
- Why are you getting upset?

16:46.673 --> 16:49.620
Because, Dad, if this was Claire's wedding,
you would be all over it.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.782
You'd be wanting to have it at your club.
You'd be inviting all your friends.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.725
Oh, please! I wasn't that thrilled
when Claire got married either.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.092
"Either"?
For God's sake, just stop talking.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.653
Everybody back off.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.426
I don't think I'm out of line...

17:01.488 --> 17:04.958
suggesting my friends don't want to see
a father-son dance at a big gay wedding.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.096
There is no father-son dance, Dad.

17:07.160 --> 17:11.301
I don't know what things go on. Do I walk you
down the aisle? Does someone throw a bouquet?

17:11.364 --> 17:15.073
I'm just saying, I don't know how this stuff
plays out with my guys from the club.

17:15.135 --> 17:18.082
You mean the guys who sit around
the locker room watching football naked?

17:18.137 --> 17:20.617
No, this isn't about them.
This is about you

17:20.673 --> 17:22.618
You are the one
that's uncomfortable here.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.915
Fine. I admit it.
This whole wedding thing is weird to me.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.457
Wow.

17:26.512 --> 17:29.221
Now, see, why do you get to be you,
but I don't get to be me?

17:29.282 --> 17:31.990
I didn't choose to be uncomfortable.
I was born this way.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.658
Are you really throwing a gay anthem
in our face right now?

17:34.721 --> 17:37.327
Give me some credit.
You know how far I've come.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.631
I mean, what more do you want from me?

17:39.692 --> 17:42.002
You know what, Dad?
You do. You get to be you.

17:42.062 --> 17:47.011
If it really makes you that uncomfortable,
then... don't come to the wedding.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.307
- Ay.
- Mitchell.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.712
No! See? We're scaling back already.

17:55.675 --> 17:59.487
Phil, honey. What happened down there?

17:59.546 --> 18:02.459
- You attacked me.
- In a fun way. We were both doing it.

18:02.515 --> 18:06.429
I heard you this morning
talking about your super-cute boyfriend Bobby...

18:06.486 --> 18:07.988
saying I was the comfortable choice...

18:08.054 --> 18:10.000
that you only married me
because your dad hated it.

18:10.056 --> 18:12.559
No, sweetheart.
I was not talking about you.

18:12.625 --> 18:17.904
I was explaining to the girls about an outfit
that I was wearing in a picture...

18:17.964 --> 18:22.379
that was the comfortable choice
that my dad hated.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.245
Oh, honey. You can't possibly think
that's why I married you.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.444
Okay, I-I get it a-about your dad.

18:27.507 --> 18:31.421
I-I- Sometimes I do wonder, you know,
if you hadn't gotten pregnant-

18:31.478 --> 18:33.754
- Would we even be here right now?
- Yeah.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.259
I wonder the same thing too.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.296
- You do?
- Yes. All the time.

18:38.351 --> 18:42.299
Just last week, you and the kids
were outside washing the car...

18:42.355 --> 18:44.335
and you got in that soap battle...

18:44.390 --> 18:47.132
and everybody was running around,
laughing.

18:47.193 --> 18:50.868
And I stood there
at the kitchen window...

18:50.930 --> 18:53.934
and I was thinking how lucky I am.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.004
Because I would have missed all of this
if I hadn't married you.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.710
I knew you were watching.
That's why I dropped the sponge.

18:59.772 --> 19:02.878
Mmm. That's what got my attention
in the first place.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.286
You really don't regret
not marrying Bobby Nash?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.552
No. He was cute, but he was boring.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.560
He never once made me laugh.

19:09.616 --> 19:13.086
- You laugh at me all the time.
- I do.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.729
I liked how happy you were
when you thought I was pregnant.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.995
Of course I was.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.435
Oh.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.135
Hmm.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.145
Do you think you could
pick that up for me?

19:28.201 --> 19:30.909
- I don't know.
- Oh?

19:30.970 --> 19:34.144
- It's so far down here.
- Schwing!

19:34.207 --> 19:36.983
See? I told you they were gonna be fine.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.489
Door lock!

19:39.546 --> 19:40.923
- Run!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

19:40.980 --> 19:42.050
Ew! Ew!

19:44.083 --> 19:46.256
Hey, Phil. It's Mitchell, Claire's brother.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.789
I heard about your and Claire's
whole pregnancy situation...

19:49.856 --> 19:53.565
and I'm sorry my dad
didn't have a better reaction.

19:53.626 --> 19:56.869
Don't take it personally
He's just like that. He'l- He'll come around

19:56.930 --> 19:58.466
And if not-

19:58.531 --> 20:02.172
well, his loss.

20:02.235 --> 20:04.977
Yeah, okay. anyway.
uh, now that we're gonna be family..

20:05.038 --> 20:07.245
It's probably a little weird for me
to date your cousin.

20:07.307 --> 20:11.278
So maybe you could ask her
to stop paging me?

20:11.344 --> 20:13.221
Wow.

20:13.279 --> 20:14.781
- It's so crazy.
- I know.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.849
Uncle Mitchell with a pager.

20:25.024 --> 20:26.901
No, Stella. ¡Que no!

20:34.934 --> 20:37.380
Stella, I said no.

20:41.174 --> 20:42.983
You-

20:44.544 --> 20:46.990
Okay. But just this time, okay?

20:47.046 --> 20:50.118
And you keep your mouth shut about this.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.858
Who's there?
