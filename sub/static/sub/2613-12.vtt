00:56.687 --> 00:58.006
Damn it!

01:02.988 --> 01:05.104
Son of a bitch.

01:05.384 --> 01:07.736
You look where you're going?
You almost killed me.

01:07.736 --> 01:08.807
I barely tapped you.

01:08.807 --> 01:09.851
You rammed my bumper, man.

01:09.851 --> 01:11.735
Let the insurance companies 
take care of this.

01:11.735 --> 01:13.007
Just give me your information.

01:13.007 --> 01:15.313
Yeah, like hell. 
You give me yours. / Fine.

01:15.313 --> 01:17.107
Here, idiot.

01:17.588 --> 01:18.587
Back off.

01:18.587 --> 01:20.292
Hand it over. / I said back off!

01:20.611 --> 01:23.029
Back off! / Get your hands off me.

02:07.470 --> 02:08.600
Excuse me.

02:09.636 --> 02:10.872
Excuse me.

02:13.110 --> 02:14.826
Would you mind I asked 
you a few questions?

02:14.826 --> 02:16.915
Everybody's been asking 
me questions today.

02:16.915 --> 02:20.846
Because it helps our witnesses 
have fresh memories.

02:21.119 --> 02:23.749
I memorized the alphabet.

02:28.295 --> 02:31.249
You did? That's good.
That's not easy, is it?

02:31.249 --> 02:32.763
No. / No.

02:33.159 --> 02:36.515
no. My name is Horatio.

02:36.515 --> 02:38.685
- What's yours, buddy?
- It's not buddy.

02:38.685 --> 02:41.835
It's Eugene thomas walters.

02:41.835 --> 02:43.348
Eugene.

02:43.645 --> 02:45.444
I saw everything.

02:46.175 --> 02:48.275
What can you tell me about the 
man who held the gun,

02:48.275 --> 02:50.240
who did the shooting?
Did you see his face?

02:50.240 --> 02:51.879
Colton.

02:51.879 --> 02:54.096
Colton. So, you know his name.

02:54.096 --> 02:55.614
Do you know him?

02:56.140 --> 02:59.164
No. I saw everything.

02:59.164 --> 03:01.368
He had clean windows.

03:01.368 --> 03:03.078
His windows were clean.

03:03.078 --> 03:04.414
Yes...

03:04.414 --> 03:07.244
Eugene, will you do me a favor?

03:07.244 --> 03:08.415
Would you wait right here?

03:08.415 --> 03:10.112
Yes. / Okay.

03:15.180 --> 03:17.344
Is Eugene our only witness?

03:17.344 --> 03:18.683
Yes, he is.

03:18.683 --> 03:21.326
I'm guessing he's mental age is about...

03:21.326 --> 03:22.602
seven or eight. / Mm-hmm.

03:22.602 --> 03:23.860
It's called pre-logic.

03:23.860 --> 03:29.507
He has a difficulty distinguishing
between fantasy and reality.

03:29.507 --> 03:31.028
But he says he saw everything.

03:31.028 --> 03:34.293
Yeah. That's what he says...

03:34.685 --> 03:36.554
and that...

03:36.837 --> 03:38.768
is going to be the challenge.

04:28.454 --> 04:31.447
Okay. Our victim's name
is Richard beckham.

04:31.447 --> 04:33.877
Let's find out everything
we can about him, all right?

04:33.877 --> 04:36.816
If he works in the building
or was just visiting.

04:36.816 --> 04:38.002
What about our witness?

04:38.002 --> 04:40.597
He does have information 
on our suspect, Colton.

04:40.597 --> 04:42.888
No jury would find Eugine competent,

04:42.888 --> 04:44.699
and I don't want to put 
him through that, all right?

04:44.699 --> 04:46.292
A witness is a witness. / Right.

04:46.292 --> 04:48.284
Let's stay with the evidence.

04:48.284 --> 04:49.783
You got it. / All right.

04:52.715 --> 04:57.119
People might play nicer with a fender bender
if they realized that three out of ten people

04:57.119 --> 04:58.899
stash a gun in their car.

04:59.534 --> 05:01.337
That true? / Yup.

05:02.016 --> 05:05.203
Then I'll think a little harder
next time I flip someone the bird.

05:07.239 --> 05:09.365
That glass belong to the bad guy's car?

05:09.365 --> 05:13.643
There's no broken lights
on the victim's car, so... / Whoa...

05:13.643 --> 05:16.613
found something else that 
might belong to the bad guy.

05:21.985 --> 05:23.773
380 beretta tomcat.

05:24.573 --> 05:26.891
That's what I like about criminals.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.096
Not the brightest.

05:28.096 --> 05:30.721
Leaving a murder weapon at the scene.
That's good.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.751
Unless it's not the murder weapon.

05:33.292 --> 05:36.285
Why is that? / It's fully loaded.

05:36.285 --> 05:38.594
Maybe there was one in the chamber.

05:41.265 --> 05:44.770
Well, the only way to tell for sure
if this is the actual murder weapon

05:44.770 --> 05:46.766
is to find the bullet and the casing.

05:47.644 --> 05:49.426
Then start looking...

05:50.513 --> 05:52.306
Because we got a through-and-through.

05:54.734 --> 05:56.813
Got another D.B. Gentlemen?

05:56.813 --> 05:57.921
Yes, ma'am.

05:58.543 --> 05:59.911
See you later, Calleigh.

06:05.331 --> 06:08.377
African american girl,
could be in her teens.

06:08.888 --> 06:10.182
Who called it in?

06:10.182 --> 06:12.521
Couple of snowbirds from Ottawa

06:12.521 --> 06:14.407
on their way to lauderdale for the winter.

06:14.407 --> 06:17.249
Stopped to stretch their legs,
and they found her instead.

06:17.249 --> 06:19.584
Why isn't Broward county handling this?

06:19.584 --> 06:22.581
'Cause county line is 500 yards that way.

06:24.423 --> 06:27.914
- Welcome to the boonies.
- Oh, sweetheart,

06:27.914 --> 06:32.498
you should be out chasing 
boys and learning cheers...

06:34.118 --> 06:35.776
not here with me.

06:40.656 --> 06:43.689
Jenny kincaid. 16.

06:44.108 --> 06:46.660
Money's gone...they left the wallet.

06:46.660 --> 06:48.656
Robbery gone bad?

06:48.656 --> 06:52.551
I don't even think the murder
was committed here. Look.

06:54.290 --> 06:56.219
Double lividity.

06:57.324 --> 07:00.013
Yeah, they probably brought 
her here lying on one side,

07:00.013 --> 07:01.393
dumped her lying on the other.

07:01.393 --> 07:03.156
Blood settled twice.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.127
Her neck looks like it's been broken.

07:05.890 --> 07:07.688
Trauma or a fall?

07:07.688 --> 07:10.246
I'll know better when we get 
her back for the post.

07:15.199 --> 07:17.520
That weather's coming in pretty fast.

07:19.476 --> 07:21.759
You willing to hold off on trace?

07:21.759 --> 07:25.669
- I am if you are.
- I'll do the rest at post.

08:28.402 --> 08:29.883
I knew you'd be waiting.

08:29.883 --> 08:31.124
Probative?

08:31.506 --> 08:33.619
There was no bullet in the parking structure,

08:33.619 --> 08:35.679
so I'm going to go to the lab and 
check for prints on the gun.

08:35.679 --> 08:37.054
I'll let you know if I find anything.

08:37.054 --> 08:38.596
Okay, do that. / Okay.

08:39.866 --> 08:41.034
Eugene.

08:41.034 --> 08:42.368
Hi.

08:45.074 --> 08:46.356
Eugene, what are you doing here?

08:46.356 --> 08:48.852
A policeman drove me here.

08:48.852 --> 08:50.361
You, you left me.

08:50.361 --> 08:53.107
I, I'm continuing with the investigation.

08:53.107 --> 08:55.084
Well, I saw everything.

08:55.084 --> 08:56.492
Don't you want my help?

08:56.492 --> 08:58.547
I do want your help. Um...

08:59.385 --> 09:01.738
I'm smarter than people think I am.

09:01.738 --> 09:03.712
All right, have you...

09:04.475 --> 09:07.353
have you ever looked at mug shots? / Yeah.

09:08.209 --> 09:09.701
What are mug shots?

09:09.701 --> 09:11.324
You know what? Let's go find out.

09:11.324 --> 09:14.393
Let's look at some, all right?
Come on.

09:19.039 --> 09:20.586
Colton's not in here.

09:20.586 --> 09:22.790
All right, you konw, sometimes...

09:22.790 --> 09:25.555
sometimes people look different in pictures.

09:25.555 --> 09:27.598
Then how do you know it's them?

09:30.246 --> 09:34.084
That... that is an excellent point.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.115
I think I'm too confused.

09:40.603 --> 09:43.663
Okay. /  It's 'cause I...

09:44.016 --> 09:46.426
was sick when I was little.

09:46.426 --> 09:47.652
I got a fever.

09:47.652 --> 09:49.705
Eugene, you did fine.

09:49.705 --> 09:51.560
You did great.

09:51.560 --> 09:55.959
I want to be able to do a real job, like you.

09:59.611 --> 10:01.150
Eugene...

10:02.081 --> 10:04.506
Eugene, what do you remember...

10:04.506 --> 10:07.298
what do you remember
about the car that got hit?

10:07.298 --> 10:08.606
It was silver.

10:08.606 --> 10:13.550
A silver car with heavy 
weights and towels and...

10:14.085 --> 10:17.831
a jump rope, and... lots of bottles...

10:17.831 --> 10:24.437
Oh, oh, one of those big gigantic rubber 
bands and lots of bottles of water.

10:24.437 --> 10:26.516
And these things were inside the car..

10:26.516 --> 10:28.464
Yeah, inside the car.

10:28.464 --> 10:33.558
And you know this because you washed 
the silver car's windows, didn't you?

10:34.364 --> 10:36.775
I wash people's windows all the time.

10:36.775 --> 10:38.343
Some people yell at me.

10:38.343 --> 10:39.846
Some people give me quarters.

10:39.846 --> 10:42.481
- Hang on, buddy.
- I got a vermont quarter.

10:42.481 --> 10:44.518
I,I keep wanting a florida quarter,

10:44.518 --> 10:46.570
- Okay, hang on, buddy.
- But they're really hard to find.

10:46.570 --> 10:49.196
- I got it. Hang on.
- Florida quarters are hard.

10:49.196 --> 10:50.475
Yeah, Yelina, listen,

10:50.475 --> 10:54.002
I think our shooter may be a fitness trainer.

10:54.002 --> 10:56.288
Well, there's no gym in the building.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.390
I'll canvass and see if anyone 
had an appointment with a trainer.

10:59.390 --> 11:01.291
Okay, what about our victim's office?

11:01.291 --> 11:03.065
Manager let me in.

11:03.065 --> 11:07.940
You'll be interested to know that 
our victim was a diamond broker.

11:07.940 --> 11:09.056
Okay, here's what you do.

11:09.056 --> 11:12.704
Get a client list and find out
if he had a delivery today, all right?

11:12.704 --> 11:13.991
You got it.

11:16.339 --> 11:18.354
Nice going, Eugene.

11:23.488 --> 11:26.198
Alexx, what's up?
You forget about your boys, or what?

11:26.198 --> 11:27.862
No way, baby. Never.

11:27.862 --> 11:30.281
All right, so where's that 
trace you promised us?

11:30.281 --> 11:31.800
The rest stop girl.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.600
Just finished post on 
Horatio's garage shooting.

11:35.756 --> 11:37.836
She hasn't shown up yet.

11:37.836 --> 11:40.260
Alexx, that was four hours ago.

11:52.222 --> 11:54.972
Okay, first call came in at 9:15.

11:54.972 --> 11:57.974
Opa-locka body haulers dispatched at 9:45.

11:57.974 --> 11:59.656
There's no record of them dropping it off?

11:59.656 --> 12:01.248
Rest stop's 20 miles from here.

12:01.248 --> 12:02.852
Should take an hour, tops.

12:02.852 --> 12:05.531
I never saw that transport guy before.
Does he work for us?

12:05.531 --> 12:07.915
Crime scenes in the sticks
aren't handled by our guys.

12:07.915 --> 12:11.107
County hires outside haulers, more efficient.

12:11.728 --> 12:12.541
Neck fracture.

12:12.541 --> 12:14.839
Haven't collected trace, so take it easy, okay?

12:14.839 --> 12:16.788
Yes, ma'am. Good luck, boys.

12:16.788 --> 12:18.943
Okay, well, anybody get his name 'cause I didn't.

12:18.943 --> 12:20.904
When's the last time you
asked for a hauler's name?

12:20.904 --> 12:25.504
Oh, lord, please don't tell me we sent 
a body away with a complete stranger.

12:25.504 --> 12:29.808
- Alexx, we sent a body away...
- Timmy... I know.

13:17.893 --> 13:19.269
Hey...

13:19.269 --> 13:20.757
Looked for you in firearms.

13:20.757 --> 13:24.250
Yeah, I hit a dead end with the gun.
It was registered to our victim.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.196
Let's say the victim pulled out his 
own weapon for self-defense purposes,

13:27.196 --> 13:29.743
and the bad guy took it and shot him with it.

13:29.743 --> 13:32.449
Unfortunately, there's just  no way to prove it.

13:32.449 --> 13:35.103
Because we have no prints on the gun, right?

13:35.103 --> 13:36.030
Mm-hmm.

13:36.030 --> 13:38.597
I'm looking at these pictures 
because I couldn't get a stock number,

13:38.597 --> 13:41.528
so I had to do a practical.

13:44.667 --> 13:47.632
and where one door closes...

13:48.218 --> 13:50.262
killer drives a Chrysler concorde.

13:50.262 --> 13:52.597
I'll get ahold of DMV. / Nice.

13:55.743 --> 13:58.810
Doug, did you shoot Richard beckham?

13:59.815 --> 14:00.637
Who is that?

14:00.637 --> 14:04.551
A broken tail light from your car
places you at the scene.

14:04.551 --> 14:06.584
Look, whoever the guy was,

14:07.445 --> 14:09.305
he rams my bumper,

14:09.305 --> 14:10.604
next thing I know, he pulls out a gun.

14:10.604 --> 14:12.817
Right, and you shot him with that gun, right?

14:12.817 --> 14:14.372
No. no. No way.

14:14.372 --> 14:16.259
He scared the hell out
of me, waving that thing around.

14:16.259 --> 14:19.198
I got back in my car, and I took off.

14:19.658 --> 14:21.326
- My bumper, man.
- Don't even think about it.

14:21.326 --> 14:23.083
Get back in the car. / Whoa, whoa.

14:23.083 --> 14:24.808
Get back in the car!

14:27.059 --> 14:29.839
He was alive when I drove away.

14:30.880 --> 14:34.005
What do we have here?

14:34.005 --> 14:38.703
Doug, did you know that Richard 
beckham was a diamond dealer?

14:39.374 --> 14:41.687
No. / Did you know he was delivering two million

14:41.687 --> 14:44.667
in cut diamonds to Brianna corsini this morning?

14:45.599 --> 14:49.237
No. / But you were with her 
earlier this morning, right?

14:49.237 --> 14:51.219
You are her trainer, right?

14:52.240 --> 14:54.066
Yeah. / We got a yes.

14:54.066 --> 14:56.401
Did you ever go by the name of Colton?

14:56.401 --> 14:58.724
No. / So we're back to no.

14:59.103 --> 15:01.683
Look, if, if you don't believe me,

15:01.683 --> 15:03.418
please, ask around.

15:04.457 --> 15:06.464
I think I might just do that.

15:14.252 --> 15:15.664
Okay, Eugene.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.148
This is your chance.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.339
Now take your time.

15:25.597 --> 15:28.323
- They don't look like Colton.
- You're sure?

15:28.323 --> 15:32.696
Unless Colton changed his face,
Colton was...

15:33.221 --> 15:35.818
Okay. Colton's very angry.

15:35.818 --> 15:37.666
Yeah. / Right.

15:39.321 --> 15:41.994
- You're disappointed in me.
- No, this is hard stuff.

15:41.994 --> 15:43.228
Yeah.

15:43.692 --> 15:48.191
Yeah, my dad used to look disappointed.

15:50.315 --> 15:53.445
I'm not stupid. / No. Eugene,

15:53.445 --> 15:56.254
I know that. I know that.

15:56.941 --> 15:58.745
All right?

15:58.745 --> 16:00.575
We're going to get you a ride home.

16:00.575 --> 16:02.843
It's a halfway house, it's not a home.

16:02.843 --> 16:04.953
Okay. It's not a problem.

16:04.953 --> 16:07.110
You ready? / Uh-oh.

16:07.110 --> 16:10.728
- What's the matter?
- My tie, it's messed up.

16:10.728 --> 16:11.968
May I? / I need my mirror.

16:11.968 --> 16:13.103
Eugene.. / My mirror.

16:13.103 --> 16:14.605
It's okay. Come here.

16:14.605 --> 16:16.381
Let me do it. / Yeah.

16:16.818 --> 16:18.516
There you go.

16:18.516 --> 16:20.026
There.

16:20.026 --> 16:21.889
It's good now. / Yeah.

16:22.662 --> 16:24.749
Thank you, H.

16:26.372 --> 16:28.884
You're welcome, Eugene.
Come on.

17:29.773 --> 17:31.697
Hey. / It's good timing.

17:32.081 --> 17:33.397
Talk to me.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.356
Well, I examined the filament of Doug's car

17:36.356 --> 17:38.377
against a normal concorde bulb,

17:38.377 --> 17:39.899
and they were different colors.

17:39.899 --> 17:41.895
So I tried something else.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.543
I heated the filament first
before I broke the bulb,

17:44.543 --> 17:45.915
and when the air rushed in,

17:45.915 --> 17:48.832
the oxidation caused the 
filament to change color.

17:54.503 --> 17:57.379
which means the bulb was hot
when it was broken, right?

17:57.379 --> 17:59.899
Which is how Doug 
conveniently had the accident.

17:59.899 --> 18:02.210
He backed into Richard's car.

18:05.881 --> 18:07.531
We're talking about a bump-and-run team.

18:07.531 --> 18:09.528
So there's another party involved here.

18:09.528 --> 18:12.422
Okay, we need to take another
look at the crime scene.

18:12.422 --> 18:13.406
Okay.

18:22.975 --> 18:25.024
Yelina just booked Doug.

18:25.446 --> 18:26.878
Okay.

18:27.291 --> 18:29.690
All right, here's the problem 
with Doug. He's a sidekick.

18:29.690 --> 18:30.889
We are looking for the shooter.

18:30.889 --> 18:32.913
Eugene has been right all along.

18:32.913 --> 18:34.761
It, it's just that Colton.

18:34.761 --> 18:36.061
isn't a lot to go on.

18:36.061 --> 18:37.821
And that's why we have
to recover that bullet.

18:37.821 --> 18:40.303
I don't know what to do.
I have been through the garage,

18:40.303 --> 18:43.675
top to bottom, twice,
back with a metal detector,

18:43.675 --> 18:46.063
- and I haven't found the bullet.
- Hold on a second.

18:47.131 --> 18:48.348
Huh.

18:48.348 --> 18:50.614
Take a look at this parking space.

18:51.116 --> 18:54.186
- It's empty.
- Empty at the time of the photograph, right?

18:54.186 --> 18:56.282
So it wasn't necessarily empty

18:56.282 --> 18:57.404
when our victim was shot.

18:57.404 --> 18:59.500
These parking spaces are assigned, right?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.460
So if we find the car, we might find the bullet.

19:01.460 --> 19:05.103
We find the bullet, we find the shooter.

19:06.185 --> 19:07.311
This is the spot.

19:07.311 --> 19:09.730
Homicide is talking to the owner of the car,

19:09.730 --> 19:12.942
and he says he was at the 
dentist on crime day.

19:12.942 --> 19:15.484
And he didn't notice the guy
bleeding on the concrete?

19:15.484 --> 19:17.543
He said he was very busy.

19:19.555 --> 19:21.584
Does he usually park here?

19:21.584 --> 19:23.035
Well, here's what he said

19:23.035 --> 19:26.506
A reserved space and he always...

19:26.922 --> 19:28.336
parks head out.

19:28.336 --> 19:30.416
So, if the bullet's here, it'll be in the front.

19:37.801 --> 19:38.900
There it is.

19:49.228 --> 19:50.770
Looks like a .45.

19:50.770 --> 19:52.158
Not the victim's gun.

19:52.439 --> 19:53.816
Still has blood on it.

19:53.816 --> 19:56.034
Five lands and grooves
with a right hand twist.

19:56.034 --> 19:58.594
There's only one weapon 
I know with generals like that.

19:58.594 --> 19:59.863
Smith & wesson revolver.

19:59.863 --> 20:03.824
So this is our trajectory right here.

20:06.479 --> 20:08.088
Which means...

20:08.540 --> 20:12.273
Richard beckham was killed
somewhere in this area, right?

20:12.322 --> 20:13.727
You rammed my bumper, man.

20:13.727 --> 20:15.559
- Just give me your information.
- Like hell. You give me yours.

20:15.559 --> 20:17.681
Fine. Here.

20:19.826 --> 20:21.634
And the shooter...

20:21.634 --> 20:23.577
worked along this line.

20:23.577 --> 20:25.073
Hey, back off!

20:26.150 --> 20:28.321
And the victim never saw what hit him

20:28.625 --> 20:31.326
because that's the way these teams work.

20:37.646 --> 20:40.593
I'll run the bullet through IBIS. / Okay.

20:41.578 --> 20:42.809
Let's do that.

20:46.889 --> 20:48.966
Timmy said you found the body hauler.

20:49.299 --> 20:52.410
Yeah. Genius was trying to leave 
town in the company van.

20:52.410 --> 20:53.708
Did he still have the body?

20:53.708 --> 20:55.209
No, but he had this.

20:55.209 --> 20:58.645
He said that some guy flagged him 
down right after he left the rest stop

20:58.645 --> 21:00.479
and said he would pay for the body.

21:00.479 --> 21:02.646
Hauler sold that girl's body?

21:03.166 --> 21:06.710
Well, Eric, if the body's out there,

21:06.710 --> 21:08.248
why are we in here?

21:08.248 --> 21:11.349
Well, my guy at the Fed told me that with new bills

21:11.349 --> 21:15.678
it's very probable that only six sets 
of hands have touched them.

21:15.678 --> 21:18.362
So, ninhydrin will find them.

21:23.791 --> 21:26.884
Bureau of engraving is entirely mechanized.

21:35.523 --> 21:39.227
So, that leaves...

21:39.227 --> 21:40.457
the Fed...

21:41.659 --> 21:43.382
the bank teller...

21:43.382 --> 21:45.802
and the little creep who sold the body.

21:45.802 --> 21:48.095
And the bigger creep who paid for it.

21:49.063 --> 21:52.147
Oh, yeah. Run that sucker.

22:04.062 --> 22:05.380
Got one.

22:07.893 --> 22:09.918
All right, looks like our mystery man

22:09.918 --> 22:12.687
had a DUI back in '87.

22:13.159 --> 22:16.069
Thomas kincaid. Age 47.

22:17.376 --> 22:19.060
Look at the address.

22:19.587 --> 22:21.886
That's the same as Jenny's driver's license.

22:22.479 --> 22:24.024
The victim's father.

22:26.633 --> 22:28.863
That's your print on the stack of hundreds.

22:28.863 --> 22:31.160
And we know that you paid off the body hauler,

22:31.160 --> 22:32.782
and you dumped your daughter's corpse.

22:32.782 --> 22:34.094
Jenny...

22:34.094 --> 22:35.821
Jenny, Jenny went to the mall.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.727
We have no idea where she is.

22:37.727 --> 22:40.165
My wife's out looking
for our daughter right now.

22:40.165 --> 22:42.088
Her and her sister.

22:42.088 --> 22:45.031
Mr. Kincaid, you know where Jenny is.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.959
Why don't you just tell us?

22:47.996 --> 22:51.472
All right, well, uh, mind if we look in your car?

22:51.472 --> 22:53.349
Trunk maybe? / I do.

22:53.349 --> 22:54.692
No problem. Your wife's going to get back,

22:54.692 --> 22:56.671
we'll just ask her.

22:56.671 --> 22:58.182
Okay, well, I'll have her call you.

22:58.182 --> 23:01.561
Oh, no, don't bother.
We've already got a warrant and a backhoe.

23:01.561 --> 23:03.879
Uh, what do you think we should
start digging up first?

23:03.879 --> 23:05.103
The pool? / Sure.

23:05.103 --> 23:07.120
Maybe the gardens?

23:07.120 --> 23:11.303
I, uh, I'll take you to her.
To my daughter.

23:11.303 --> 23:14.477
- She's on the property?
- Hmm, Yeah.

23:53.374 --> 23:54.774
Yeah, we found her.

23:54.774 --> 23:56.090
Don't you let her out of your sight.

23:56.090 --> 23:57.899
I'll come get her myself.

24:02.261 --> 24:04.341
I want to know why.

24:04.341 --> 24:06.743
We were talking at the top of the stairs,

24:06.743 --> 24:09.263
and... she fell.

24:09.263 --> 24:10.660
She fell?

24:11.464 --> 24:12.984
What were you talking about?

24:12.984 --> 24:14.837
Uh, it was nothing special.

24:16.338 --> 24:18.162
It, it was an accident.

24:18.162 --> 24:22.321
Most people, when they 
have accidents, they call 911.

24:22.321 --> 24:24.354
They don't cover them up.

24:26.310 --> 24:28.190
Get him out of here.

24:32.562 --> 24:33.836
Officer, what's going on here?

24:33.836 --> 24:35.430
Don't worry. Everything's going 
to be okay. Come on.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.854
- Thomas?
- Officer, what's the meaning of this?

24:36.854 --> 24:38.326
Why are the police here?

24:39.512 --> 24:40.495
Are you handcuffed?

24:40.495 --> 24:42.369
- It's a misunderstanding, honey.
- Is Jenny okay?

24:42.369 --> 24:44.781
Go with your sister.
Go on.I, I'll be back.

24:59.102 --> 25:00.706
So, what happened to our girl?

25:00.706 --> 25:02.774
Broken neck that we knew about.

25:02.774 --> 25:05.251
But a subdural hematoma that we didn't.

25:05.487 --> 25:08.221
Impact ricocheted the brain
to the front of the skull.

25:08.221 --> 25:10.066
Contra-coup contusion.

25:11.515 --> 25:13.621
Typical in falls.

25:15.743 --> 25:18.313
Hey, Alexx, are you sure
nobody snapped her neck?

25:18.313 --> 25:23.209
Well, if someone had, there'd be 
bruising on this part of her throat.

25:23.209 --> 25:25.111
None. See?

25:25.535 --> 25:27.741
Her old man was telling the truth.

25:27.741 --> 25:28.993
Why did he try to hide the body?

25:28.993 --> 25:30.690
I don't know, Timmy.

25:31.026 --> 25:33.020
Why don't you go ask daddy,

25:33.020 --> 25:35.767
while I check for sub-cue bruising?

25:36.259 --> 25:37.552
What's that thing for?

25:37.552 --> 25:39.697
To see what you and I can't.

25:42.922 --> 25:45.026
Jenny found out that...

25:45.350 --> 25:47.597
that I was having an affair.

25:47.983 --> 25:50.285
She was going to tell my wife.

25:50.658 --> 25:52.269
So, that's what you were arguing about.

25:52.269 --> 25:53.996
Jenny got mad.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.105
I couldn't blame her.

25:56.105 --> 25:57.482
How could you do this to mom?

25:57.482 --> 26:01.207
- It's complicated.
- No, it's disgusting.

26:01.207 --> 26:03.810
I grabbed her arm to calm her down.

26:03.810 --> 26:05.561
She said to let go.

26:05.561 --> 26:07.566
- She'd tell her mom.
- She broke free from you?

26:07.566 --> 26:10.357
Yeah. And I tried to grab her again.

26:10.784 --> 26:15.014
And I, I must've been yelling at her.

26:15.014 --> 26:16.642
Must have scared her.

26:19.008 --> 26:21.068
'Cause that's when she fell.

26:21.472 --> 26:22.369
It's disgusting.

26:22.369 --> 26:23.508
Jenny, calm down. / No.

26:23.508 --> 26:24.422
Jenny!

26:29.637 --> 26:32.024
I, I couldn't just let my wife...

26:32.024 --> 26:34.764
I couldn't let my wife know
I was having an affair.

26:35.298 --> 26:36.981
I, I just needed time.

26:36.981 --> 26:40.698
Wouldn't it have been easier to explain to 
your wife than to hide your daughter's body?

26:40.698 --> 26:42.458
This wasn't just any affair.

26:44.018 --> 26:46.584
This was with my wife's sister.

26:46.584 --> 26:49.157
You mean the woman consoling your wife?

26:49.157 --> 26:52.198
Yeah. they're sisters.

27:03.702 --> 27:05.174
From Alexx.

27:14.824 --> 27:17.861
This is subcutaneous photos from the M.E.

27:17.861 --> 27:19.611
Bruising at right angle.

27:19.611 --> 27:21.786
Two points of contact.

27:22.084 --> 27:24.749
Jenny didn't fall. You pushed her.

27:25.406 --> 27:27.623
How could you do this? / Stop. Stop!

27:32.398 --> 27:34.117
No.

27:34.117 --> 27:37.427
- It did not happen that way.
- Take a look. The proof is right there.

27:37.427 --> 27:39.972
I think I'll need my lawyer now.

27:44.221 --> 27:46.813
Oh, come on, hit.

27:50.448 --> 27:51.709
Anything?

27:51.709 --> 27:54.136
I've been running this bullet
through IBIS for an hour,

27:54.136 --> 27:56.162
and I don't even have a likely suspect.

27:56.162 --> 27:58.655
So our guy is not a first-timer.

27:58.655 --> 27:59.626
But the gun is.

27:59.626 --> 28:04.012
So maybe he's the type of criminal 
that uses a fresh gun for every crime.

28:04.012 --> 28:06.105
So he gets rid of his old ones.

28:06.823 --> 28:08.009
All right.

28:09.119 --> 28:11.570
Checking F.J.D.

28:11.570 --> 28:14.041
For a stolen Smith & wesson.

28:18.693 --> 28:20.622
Lucky for us. It's a pretty rare model.

28:20.622 --> 28:23.296
Let's pick up this Chris...

28:34.992 --> 28:37.399
Let's pick up this Chris hildago fast, okay?

28:37.399 --> 28:38.923
You got it.

28:43.197 --> 28:44.043
Doctor?

28:44.043 --> 28:45.722
- Lieutenant Caine?
- How's he doing?

28:45.722 --> 28:47.225
Well, he's in no shape for questions.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.027
- And what does that mean?
- It means that he's not good.

28:49.027 --> 28:50.601
He was beaten badly, 
head traum broken pelvis.

28:50.601 --> 28:52.698
Okay, let me ask you another question.
Is he going to make it?

28:52.698 --> 28:55.264
Well, he's still bleeding because 
there's an irreversible D.I.C.

28:55.264 --> 28:56.346
D.I.C... What is that?

28:56.346 --> 29:00.391
Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
That means his blood won't clot.

29:00.391 --> 29:01.676
Look at this, we're not going to win this one.

29:01.676 --> 29:04.384
What are we talking about in 
terms of time frame, how long?

29:04.384 --> 29:06.502
It could be minutes, hours.

29:07.677 --> 29:11.020
Okay. Okay.

29:30.635 --> 29:34.974
Hey. / H.

29:35.344 --> 29:36.722
Hey.

29:38.118 --> 29:41.787
Did... we get the bad guy?

29:41.787 --> 29:43.878
No, not yet.

29:43.878 --> 29:45.679
But, Eugene, we will.

29:45.679 --> 29:47.366
We're going to get him.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.913
I want to go with you.

29:50.913 --> 29:52.469
Okay, I understand that.

29:52.926 --> 29:56.349
I need you to rest, okay?

29:56.349 --> 29:59.212
We're partners, right?

30:00.198 --> 30:01.889
Yeah.

30:02.258 --> 30:05.470
Yes, we are partners.

30:05.470 --> 30:08.221
But listen to me.
You know Eugene, sometimes...

30:08.221 --> 30:13.368
sometimes, partners cover for each other.

30:14.286 --> 30:17.206
And I'm covering for you.

30:17.738 --> 30:21.407
Okay..partner.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.503
Lieutenant Caine?

30:28.772 --> 30:32.205
Okay. Give me a minute.
Eugene, listen to me.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.612
They're going to pull me out of here, okay,

30:33.612 --> 30:35.829
but I'm going to be back in about an hour.

30:35.829 --> 30:39.684
But here's what I want you to do, Eugene.

30:39.939 --> 30:43.246
I want you to hang in there.
I want you to hang on, okay?

30:43.246 --> 30:45.291
O... kay.

30:45.291 --> 30:48.592
Okay... okay, partner.

30:52.027 --> 30:54.466
I'm sorry. / Yeah.

30:55.042 --> 30:56.157
I don't, uh...

30:56.157 --> 30:57.668
I don't think he has any family.

30:57.668 --> 30:58.905
He's indigent,

30:58.905 --> 31:00.749
so that means the county
will dispose of his body.

31:00.749 --> 31:03.521
Ma'am, the man is still alive, okay?

31:03.521 --> 31:05.260
So, thank you for your help

31:05.260 --> 31:07.302
and I'll check back with you in about an hour.

31:07.662 --> 31:09.795
Okay? Thank you.

31:19.334 --> 31:20.722
Hey, Dougie.

31:20.722 --> 31:23.486
So, decided to sic your 
partner on Eugene, huh?

31:23.486 --> 31:24.527
- I told you I didn't have a partner.
- Where is your cell phone?

31:24.527 --> 31:26.782
Right here, huh?

31:28.312 --> 31:29.991
This is your cell phone? / Yes, it is.

31:29.991 --> 31:31.261
You decided to call your buddy.

31:31.261 --> 31:32.238
No, I didn't call anyone.

31:32.238 --> 31:34.065
No? Whose number is this?
Whose number is that?

31:34.065 --> 31:35.496
It's my bail bondsman.
Bail bond. No partner.

31:35.496 --> 31:39.288
Okay, let's try calls received.
You see, it occurred to me, Doug...

31:39.288 --> 31:41.577
it occurred to me that once your 
partner finished off Eugene,

31:41.577 --> 31:43.866
he would call you. On this phone.

31:43.866 --> 31:47.348
Now, whose number is that?
Let's find out. What do you think?

31:49.508 --> 31:51.767
Hello. / Yeah, Colton.

31:51.767 --> 31:54.136
Hey, Colton, you just made
a big mistake, my friend.

31:54.136 --> 31:56.731
You should have never 
laid a hand on Eugene.

31:56.731 --> 31:59.052
Who is this? / Who is this?

32:01.042 --> 32:03.668
You are about to find out.

32:13.011 --> 32:14.856
Hey, I got your page.

32:14.856 --> 32:17.293
You hear that our victim's
dad here dummied up?

32:17.293 --> 32:19.559
Yeah, and lawyered up.

32:19.559 --> 32:21.850
Got me thinking about the struggle.

32:22.279 --> 32:24.960
Thought about my own kids fighting. Whoo.

32:24.960 --> 32:30.017
They scratch, pull hair, kick and bite.

32:30.891 --> 32:32.984
Well, what have you got?

32:34.731 --> 32:36.517
Right now, just a hunch.

32:45.429 --> 32:47.422
Okay, what about now?

32:48.254 --> 32:49.682
Tissue.

32:49.682 --> 32:51.981
And the DNA of whoever she bit.

32:56.772 --> 32:58.055
Results from the tissue?

32:58.055 --> 32:59.262
Yeah.

33:00.519 --> 33:04.228
Alleles indicate a close family relative.
The father?

33:04.228 --> 33:07.698
No. I've got the dad's DNA profile right here.
Look a little closer.

33:10.086 --> 33:11.145
Female?

33:11.145 --> 33:13.929
Did the math, and it's not the mom.

33:14.322 --> 33:18.661
- The aunt?
- Or as dad likes to call her, the uh, mistress.

33:19.051 --> 33:20.171
Excuse me?

33:20.799 --> 33:22.702
Roll up your sleeves.

33:28.496 --> 33:30.062
The other one, too.

33:38.473 --> 33:40.351
- This is none of your concern.
- You're sleeping with my dad.

33:40.351 --> 33:41.863
Either you tell my mom, or I will.

33:41.863 --> 33:43.174
Just shut up!

33:58.014 --> 34:00.102
Thomas promised me he wouldn't tell.

34:00.102 --> 34:02.513
He didn't. DNA did.

34:03.235 --> 34:04.964
Was he even there?

34:05.309 --> 34:08.428
He was downstairs, reading a book.

34:20.304 --> 34:21.896
I lied.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.952
I told him she fell.

34:26.952 --> 34:29.081
That wasn't enough for you to 
take away your sister's husband.

34:29.081 --> 34:32.460
You wanted to take away her daughter, too.

34:32.547 --> 34:35.009
She didn't deserve either.

35:06.776 --> 35:11.222
The man's going to spend years behind bars
when all he had to do was tell the truth.

35:21.183 --> 35:23.835
Cover-up gets them every time.

35:36.590 --> 35:39.062
Can we get you a ride home?

35:39.647 --> 35:41.704
I don't have a home.

35:43.548 --> 35:45.627
I'm sorry.

35:46.963 --> 35:48.937
I knew something was wrong.

35:48.937 --> 35:51.737
I just couldn't put my finger on it.

35:52.920 --> 35:55.865
My daughter figured it out.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.374
She was always so smart.

36:15.045 --> 36:17.383
So, you're Chris hildago.

36:17.383 --> 36:20.240
I know, not what you expected.
I get that a lot.

36:20.240 --> 36:23.228
I understand that you 
reported a gun missing.

36:23.228 --> 36:25.806
Yeah, it disappeared from work two days ago.

36:25.806 --> 36:28.802
.45 is a rather big gun for a woman.

36:28.802 --> 36:31.963
Yeah, well, not too many women work where I do.

36:31.963 --> 36:33.136
And where do you work?

36:33.136 --> 36:36.525
A pharmaceutical company
in the bad part of liberty city.

36:36.525 --> 36:39.222
It's the cleaning crew
that makes me nervous.

36:39.222 --> 36:41.830
Owner hires work release.
Cheap labor.

36:41.830 --> 36:43.290
Who do you think took your gun?

36:43.290 --> 36:44.689
This one guy.

36:44.689 --> 36:46.802
He's always macking me.

36:46.802 --> 36:48.710
I shine him on.

36:49.426 --> 36:52.891
Wayne...something.

36:52.891 --> 36:55.232
Okay. does Wayne still work there?

36:55.232 --> 36:59.380
Probably look too obvious if he quit
the day after he stole my gun.

37:05.772 --> 37:07.136
Wayne delroy? / Yeah.

37:07.776 --> 37:08.724
Can I help you?

37:08.724 --> 37:12.083
Chris hildago tells me that you 
asked her out three times,

37:12.083 --> 37:14.780
and when she turned you down,
her gun disappeared.

37:14.780 --> 37:17.531
Three times? She's not that hot.

37:17.909 --> 37:20.560
Besides, I'm not allowed to have firearms.

37:20.560 --> 37:22.700
- Work release.
- So, you were in the joint?

37:22.700 --> 37:24.541
Did you have a nickname in there?

37:24.541 --> 37:26.076
Jackknife,

37:26.076 --> 37:28.988
- 'cause of how I worked one.
- But not Colton?

37:28.988 --> 37:30.693
You mean like the sneakers?

37:30.693 --> 37:32.946
What do you mean, the sneakers?
What are you talking about?

37:32.946 --> 37:35.917
Well, I don't wear them,
but a lot of guys wear colton sneakers.

37:35.917 --> 37:38.198
Sneakers. who wears them?

37:42.953 --> 37:44.860
Thank you, Wayne.

37:47.768 --> 37:49.252
What's your name, pardner?

37:50.682 --> 37:52.767
Tolson, Pete tolson.

37:53.642 --> 37:55.197
Is your locker, Pete?

37:55.197 --> 38:00.151
Yup. / So, I take it that these...

38:00.151 --> 38:02.694
colton sneakers would be yours, then.

38:02.694 --> 38:03.676
That's my locker.

38:03.676 --> 38:05.909
- You shot Richard beckham, didn't you?
- I didn't shoot anyone.

38:05.909 --> 38:07.533
No?

38:08.008 --> 38:10.693
Okay. Let's see.

38:10.693 --> 38:13.048
Mind if I look in your locker, Pete?

38:13.048 --> 38:15.179
Go ahead. / Okay.

38:20.770 --> 38:22.119
This is interesting.

38:30.584 --> 38:32.545
I bought those off a fence.

38:34.455 --> 38:35.663
Really?

38:35.663 --> 38:36.837
Pete, here's what I think.

38:36.837 --> 38:40.667
I think you're part of a bump-and-run team
that crashed into Richard beckham,

38:40.667 --> 38:42.902
who was a diamond dealer.

38:49.368 --> 38:53.022
An argument between your partner 
and Mr. Beckham ensued,

38:53.022 --> 38:55.464
during which you shot Mr. Beckham.

38:55.464 --> 38:57.252
- You rammed my bumper, man.
- Give me your information.

38:57.252 --> 38:58.711
Yeah, like hell. you give me yours.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.223
Fine, here.

39:00.223 --> 39:02.554
Hey, back off. / Hand it over.
- Get your hands off me!

39:06.089 --> 39:08.670
Your partner reached into the car,

39:08.670 --> 39:10.623
grabbed these diamonds
and handed them to you.

39:10.623 --> 39:12.183
That's what I think.

39:17.953 --> 39:19.028
Here you go.

39:21.900 --> 39:24.390
All you've got are a bunch of 
diamonds I bought off a fence.

39:24.390 --> 39:25.536
Oh, on the contrary, Pete.

39:25.536 --> 39:30.231
I have... a witness who
saw you do the shooting.

39:30.231 --> 39:32.211
Yeah, like hell. you give me yours.

39:32.211 --> 39:33.826
Fine, here.

39:33.826 --> 39:35.473
- Hey, back off.
- Get your hands off me!

39:35.473 --> 39:38.106
I said hand it over. I said back off.

39:40.506 --> 39:42.411
Come on, let's go, let's go.

39:46.091 --> 39:47.265
That's a nice fairy tale.

39:47.265 --> 39:48.350
These your clothes?

39:48.350 --> 39:50.406
Yup. Laundry day.

39:50.406 --> 39:53.458
Laundry day.
I'm going to take these too.

39:59.259 --> 40:00.790
Yeah..

40:00.790 --> 40:02.346
Yeah, no, that's good.

40:02.346 --> 40:03.422
No, that's good.

40:03.422 --> 40:05.740
Okay, listen, um, I'll be right here.

40:05.740 --> 40:07.049
Yeah, I'll be here.

40:08.932 --> 40:10.586
Hey, um...

40:15.397 --> 40:18.180
Yeah? Yeah, speaking.

40:18.895 --> 40:20.569
Yes, doctor.

40:24.658 --> 40:26.108
I understand.

40:27.690 --> 40:30.308
No. Huh-uh.

40:30.308 --> 40:31.923
Okay.

40:53.227 --> 40:54.763
Okay.

40:56.475 --> 40:58.171
Better be you.

41:11.124 --> 41:12.817
We got a problem. / How so?

41:12.817 --> 41:14.781
Tolson. He beat us to the punch.

41:14.781 --> 41:17.389
He's in there cutting a deal with 
the state's attorney right now.

41:17.389 --> 41:18.603
Is that the problem?

41:23.833 --> 41:25.224
Gentlemen.

41:28.513 --> 41:34.305
Pete, I understand that you just rolled
over on your partner for the diamond heist.

41:34.305 --> 41:38.034
Hey, man, I'm not doing less than 
20 years for shooting that guy.

41:38.034 --> 41:39.135
We all pay.

41:39.135 --> 41:42.011
Yes, we do, Colton.

41:44.800 --> 41:46.941
Do you know what that is?

41:46.941 --> 41:52.571
That is your shirt with 
Eugene walker's blood on it.

41:52.571 --> 41:56.130
And it got there because you beat him to death.

41:56.436 --> 42:01.559
Now, I know you tried to wash it,
but DNA, Pete, is a funny thing,

42:01.559 --> 42:04.331
and it has a tendency to hang around.

42:07.010 --> 42:08.953
I did that guy a favor, man.

42:08.953 --> 42:11.061
That guy was a retard.

42:18.423 --> 42:19.886
You know, Pete,

42:19.886 --> 42:21.753
Eugene had some things to overcome,

42:21.753 --> 42:24.560
I will give you that, but you know what?

42:24.560 --> 42:28.723
You know what, Pete?
At the end of the day, he...

42:28.723 --> 42:32.686
just put you away for life.

42:47.794 --> 42:49.096
Excuse me.

42:49.455 --> 42:50.709
Excuse me.

42:51.332 --> 42:52.816
Hang on a minute, will you?

42:52.816 --> 42:55.538
Um, there's been a change of plans,

42:55.538 --> 42:56.961
and he's...

42:56.961 --> 42:58.980
he's going to have a private burial.

42:58.980 --> 43:01.884
So, I'll take it from here, all right?

43:01.884 --> 43:03.461
Sure, okay. / Thank you.

43:04.170 --> 43:05.273
Thank you.

43:26.625 --> 43:28.416
Eugene...

43:29.806 --> 43:32.668
Eugene, I think your dad 
would be proud of you.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.623
I really do.

43:44.185 --> 43:46.259
I know I am.
