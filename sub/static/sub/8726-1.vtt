02:14.880 --> 02:16.320
<i>Hello, Quinn.</i>

02:17.520 --> 02:19.680
Good morning, Quinn.
How's it going, mate?

02:19.760 --> 02:20.680
What's up, guys?

02:20.760 --> 02:22.400
Working the late shift,
are you?

02:22.440 --> 02:24.840
Ha! Someone's got to clean up
after you guys.

02:36.360 --> 02:37.440
<i>All right, Quinn.</i>

02:37.520 --> 02:38.760
Oi, oi, oi.
Come on, then.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.400
You're not havin' one yourself, then?

02:42.440 --> 02:44.560
No.
I'm trying to cut back.

02:48.440 --> 02:51.240
You heard from the school, then,
didn't you?

02:52.280 --> 02:54.360
Down you go.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.160
Good night, lads.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.080
- See you, Karen.
- <i>Great work. Have a good weekend.</i>

03:16.160 --> 03:17.440
Oi, Karen, here's the new recruit.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.840
- Employment office is up top.
- <i>Hi, Mum!</i>

03:19.920 --> 03:21.720
Quinn, how are you, mate?

03:23.120 --> 03:24.720
Have you been smoking?

03:24.800 --> 03:27.480
No, I told you-- I only smoke
when I've been drinking.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.120
What's wrong?

03:30.160 --> 03:31.200
Nothing.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.880
Quinn... what is it?

03:40.400 --> 03:42.840
You've got something
you want to show me.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.320
You know what it says.

04:05.360 --> 04:09.720
Scholarship was worth...
Â£3,000 a year.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.080
<i>We don't have that sort of money.</i>

04:12.120 --> 04:14.120
Maybe we could ask Dad to pay.

04:17.160 --> 04:18.720
Sorry.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.680
<i>Karen?</i>

04:19.760 --> 04:20.640
What?

04:20.720 --> 04:22.120
Got a problem at number 4.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.560
Jess says he's hit
some sort of a void.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.240
Oh, that bitch hasn't a clue
to what she's doing.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.920
Hey... Quinn.

04:52.040 --> 04:55.120
And what brings you
to the arsehole of the world?

04:55.160 --> 04:57.720
You're passing through it.
What's that make you?

04:57.800 --> 04:59.240
Ha.

05:00.520 --> 05:01.720
Here.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.120
Why don't you go inside
and have a wee look?

05:17.800 --> 05:19.520
<i>Oh.</i>

05:39.720 --> 05:41.480
Wicked.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.040
Whoa.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.560
- <i>I know it's still...</i>
- <i>Well, I covered it.</i>

06:29.640 --> 06:30.520
What-- Quinn!

06:31.920 --> 06:33.640
Mum, there's something in there.

06:33.680 --> 06:34.840
There's something in the hole!

06:34.920 --> 06:36.000
Damn it, Jess!

06:36.080 --> 06:37.480
It's unsafe conditions!

06:37.560 --> 06:39.240
Here.
Let's look at this void.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.840
It's unsafe!

06:40.880 --> 06:43.600
I'm just going to wash
your eyes out, okay?

06:43.640 --> 06:44.960
Mum, we've got to go!

06:45.040 --> 06:47.240
No, no.
We've got to do this fast.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.240
Open your eyes.
Open them up. Open them.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.040
Oh.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.320
Give me that.

07:12.840 --> 07:13.720
Get in!

07:20.880 --> 07:22.720
Mum, there was something in there!

07:25.520 --> 07:27.360
Come here!

07:31.640 --> 07:33.720
Come on! Come on!

07:36.760 --> 07:37.480
Mum!

07:55.520 --> 07:56.920
Mum?

07:58.480 --> 08:03.160
Mum?

08:13.320 --> 08:15.400
<i>I've kept this for years,</i>

08:15.440 --> 08:17.800
<i>because someday
it will be up to you.</i>

08:17.840 --> 08:20.240
<i>I don't want you to be afraid.</i>

08:20.320 --> 08:22.400
<i>I want you to understand.</i>

08:24.680 --> 08:26.960
<i>Knowledge is the only weapon
we've got left.</i>

08:27.000 --> 08:29.680
<i>In the beginning,
it was ignorance that destroyed us.</i>

08:29.720 --> 08:33.360
<i>I saw the first, but soon
the world saw millions.</i>

08:33.400 --> 08:34.960
<i>No one knew how
they spawned so fast.</i>

08:35.039 --> 08:36.520
<i>They swarmed like locusts,</i>

08:36.640 --> 08:38.480
<i>burning everything in their path,</i>

08:38.520 --> 08:41.640
<i>driven by one purpose--
to feed.</i>

08:41.640 --> 08:43.840
<i>Even then, we couldn't believe
they were real.</i>

08:43.880 --> 08:46.520
<i>Ancient man had made them into myths,</i>

08:46.640 --> 08:49.840
<i>but nature had made something
far more terrible.</i>

08:49.880 --> 08:53.040
<i>Too late, our scientists discovered
their true identity--</i>

08:53.080 --> 08:56.320
<i>a species which had burned
the dinosaurs to dust,</i>

08:56.400 --> 08:59.360
<i>whose ash had brought on ice ages,</i>

08:59.440 --> 09:02.600
<i>who, in eons past, had scorched
the world clean of life,</i>

09:02.640 --> 09:05.520
<i>then starved, then slept,</i>

09:05.640 --> 09:07.880
<i>waiting for the Earth
to replenish itself,</i>

09:08.000 --> 09:10.640
- <i>5... 4... 3...</i>
- <i>waiting to start their cycle anew.</i>

09:10.760 --> 09:13.320
- <i>2... 1.</i>
- <i>Our weapons shot fire back at them,</i>

09:13.400 --> 09:15.120
<i>yet for every one of them killed,</i>

09:15.160 --> 09:16.760
<i>a hundred took its place.</i>

09:16.840 --> 09:18.440
<i>They seemed invulnerable.</i>

09:20.240 --> 09:22.720
<i>We could only look on
as our leaders used</i>

09:22.760 --> 09:25.120
<i>their greatest arsenal to destroy them.</i>

09:25.200 --> 09:27.440
<i>But in the end,
we only helped them,</i>

09:27.480 --> 09:29.200
<i>till the world burned</i>

09:29.280 --> 09:32.840
<i>and the few of us that were left
fled the cities,</i>

09:32.880 --> 09:35.000
<i>found shelter where we could.</i>

09:35.080 --> 09:38.240
<i>You have to understand our past</i>

09:38.320 --> 09:40.240
<i>because you will decide our future.</i>

09:40.320 --> 09:41.640
<i>They're starving now,</i>

09:41.720 --> 09:44.400
<i>and they're more dangerous
than ever.</i>

09:44.440 --> 09:46.600
<i>But we have to go on.</i>

09:46.640 --> 09:49.040
<i>We have to outlast them.</i>

09:49.120 --> 09:52.320
<i>Only one species is getting
out of this alive.</i>

10:07.640 --> 10:08.840
<i>Hey, Quinn!</i>

10:08.880 --> 10:10.640
<i>Come and have a look at this!</i>

10:10.640 --> 10:14.120
It's a straight drop now
from the water tower.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.880
You just pull the plug,

10:15.880 --> 10:19.040
<i>500 gallons per minute
hits the walls.</i>

10:20.720 --> 10:22.520
Don't care about the specs, Jerry.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.600
1,200 centigrade--
can it take it?

10:24.640 --> 10:26.240
Yeah. Course it can.

10:26.320 --> 10:29.160
Remember, I used to build
blast furnaces for a living.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.760
<i>I know all about fire.</i>

10:30.760 --> 10:32.960
Of course you do.
Sorry, mate.

10:33.040 --> 10:33.960
Nice one.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.880
Eddie's gone psycho.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.440
- Jared?
- <i>Yeah, Quinn?</i>

10:52.520 --> 10:54.400
Keep 'em at it.
No slacking!

10:54.480 --> 10:56.320
You heard him.
No slacking.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.880
Go!

11:03.920 --> 11:06.080
<i>...I shall always walk.</i>

11:06.160 --> 11:08.080
<i>Ye, though his brethren rose</i>

11:08.160 --> 11:10.480
<i>like locusts from the Earth, Quinn,</i>

11:10.560 --> 11:12.640
- no weapon could save me!
- Yeah.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.440
- No fire could extinguish theirs!
- Yeah.

11:15.520 --> 11:17.480
- They will prepare...
- Cheers, mate.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.560
What's up, Quinn?

11:44.720 --> 11:46.080
What are you doing, Eddie?

11:46.160 --> 11:49.440
Me and a few others,
we're going harvesting, Quinn.

11:49.520 --> 11:50.600
No, you're not.

11:50.680 --> 11:53.160
It's not ready.
We spoke about this.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.720
Half the stuff's not ripe.
You pick it now, it won't germinate.

11:55.760 --> 11:58.160
That means no seeds.
That means nothing to plant next season.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.440
There won't be a next season.
We'll be starved to death.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.320
What is this?
We can do it, Eddie.

12:02.400 --> 12:04.320
We decided, all of us,
you as well--

12:04.400 --> 12:07.400
dig in, work together,
outlast them.

12:07.480 --> 12:10.200
Kids can't eat hope, Quinn.
Edinburgh's gone.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.600
<i>We haven't heard from Pembury
or Norwich in two years!</i>

12:13.680 --> 12:15.200
We're on our own, Quinn.

12:15.280 --> 12:18.880
Yeah, we know that. That's why we have to hang on.
Maybe we <i>are</i> all that's left.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.040
Eight years I've listened to you,
and for what?

12:22.120 --> 12:24.720
Two kids and a wife
buried on the road.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.760
I'm not losing these, Quinn,

12:26.840 --> 12:28.240
<i>not when there's food out there.</i>

12:28.280 --> 12:29.960
Sorry, Eddie.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.280
You're not going anywhere.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.320
- Give me the keys.
- You bloody take 'em from me.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.960
It's a community, not a prison.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.880
Eddie... you can argue
as much as you like.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.800
It makes no difference.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.240
<i>The point is,
if you go out those gates,</i>

12:45.320 --> 12:46.880
then you jeopardize this community--

12:46.960 --> 12:49.160
you can stay out there,
because you're not coming back.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.520
All right.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.360
I'm keeping these.

13:09.360 --> 13:12.400
Hey, Quinn.

13:12.480 --> 13:15.360
You know, I'm your best friend,

13:15.440 --> 13:18.120
and sometimes
even I don't like you.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.120
Sorry.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.040
"Join me,"
the black knight says,

13:36.120 --> 13:38.960
"then we can end
this conflict forever."

13:39.000 --> 13:40.920
Never!

13:44.720 --> 13:47.520
"I'll never join you,"
the white knight says.

13:47.600 --> 13:49.480
"You killed my father."

13:54.960 --> 13:55.880
Creedy!

13:57.720 --> 14:01.480
The black knight stares
through the holes in his shiny mask,

14:01.520 --> 14:05.440
<i>and he speaks words that burn
into our hero's heart forever.</i>

14:10.960 --> 14:13.760
"I... am your father."

14:16.880 --> 14:17.800
No!

14:23.480 --> 14:25.920
Did you make that up, Mr. Quinn?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.360
Course I did.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.760
All right, kids.
Time for bed.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.000
- No! No!
- One more!

14:34.040 --> 14:36.200
Tomorrow. No, no.
Prayers first.

14:37.760 --> 14:38.640
<i>Tomorrow!</i>

14:38.720 --> 14:40.360
- "The Lion King"!
- Yeah!

14:40.440 --> 14:42.560
<i>Tomorrow!
Prayers first!</i>

14:46.880 --> 14:48.200
Okay.

14:50.160 --> 14:52.120
<i>Ready?</i>

14:52.200 --> 14:54.440
What do we do when we wake?

14:54.480 --> 14:58.520
Keep both eyes on the sky.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.760
What do we do when we sleep?

15:00.840 --> 15:04.040
Keep one eye on the sky.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.240
What do we do when we see them?

15:06.320 --> 15:09.160
Dig hard, dig deep,

15:09.200 --> 15:10.640
run for shelter,

15:10.680 --> 15:12.880
and never look back.

15:12.920 --> 15:13.840
Well done.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.080
Good night, guys.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.080
Bedtime.

15:17.520 --> 15:18.400
Bedtime!

15:18.480 --> 15:19.480
Good night.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.360
<i>Why can't we stay up later?</i>

15:44.480 --> 15:45.800
Michael?

15:45.840 --> 15:47.400
Quinn's asleep.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.320
I took the keys.
Let's go.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.560
<i>You keep quiet.</i>

17:12.040 --> 17:13.560
<i>Hello, Liam.</i>

17:13.680 --> 17:16.800
Willem says it's dragon breath.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.680
Don't you listen to him.
It's just the wind.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.720
Okay.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.640
Oh, God.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.280
Ajay, alarm.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.960
Take cover, kids.
Come on, now.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.320
There we go, then.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.560
<i>Okay, children!</i>

19:13.680 --> 19:16.200
Head up!
One at a time!

19:16.280 --> 19:17.320
1... 2...

19:17.320 --> 19:20.400
<i>Single file. Single file.</i>

19:24.640 --> 19:25.680
Let's move!

19:25.760 --> 19:26.800
Right.

19:29.680 --> 19:32.000
Move the kids.
Let's go. Come on.

19:33.800 --> 19:34.760
Creedy?

19:34.800 --> 19:35.960
- Yeah?
- You got a count?

19:36.040 --> 19:36.920
Yeah. We're good.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.160
<i>Quinn!</i>

19:39.240 --> 19:40.440
Quinn!

19:40.520 --> 19:41.800
<i>In the field.</i>

20:30.800 --> 20:31.680
Dragons!

20:31.760 --> 20:32.640
Go get Eddie.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.040
Rachel!

21:03.080 --> 21:04.520
<i>I'm here!</i>

21:05.520 --> 21:08.240
Devon!

21:08.280 --> 21:09.480
- Devon!
- <i>Michael!</i>

21:09.520 --> 21:11.640
- D-- where's Michael?
- <i>Michael?</i>

21:12.960 --> 21:14.680
Michael! Michael!

21:14.760 --> 21:15.800
You okay?

21:17.520 --> 21:19.200
- Where's Matt?
- He's dead.

21:20.720 --> 21:21.640
Eddie!

21:23.920 --> 21:25.800
Let's go! Move!

21:40.240 --> 21:42.240
- Come on! Go!
- Come on, Michael!

21:42.320 --> 21:44.560
Go! Move!

21:46.000 --> 21:47.400
Keep going! Come on!

22:02.040 --> 22:04.840
Dad... w-what'll we do?

22:06.160 --> 22:07.520
<i>We're trapped!</i>

22:19.360 --> 22:20.840
Come on!

22:20.880 --> 22:22.240
Go!

22:22.320 --> 22:25.480
- Move it!
- Hurry up!

22:25.520 --> 22:27.560
Go! Come on!
Quick!

22:29.200 --> 22:31.240
Get in there!
Get in!

22:48.200 --> 22:49.240
<i>You okay?</i>

23:12.240 --> 23:14.120
Devon!

23:14.160 --> 23:15.720
Come on, Creedy.
Come on, Creedy!

23:15.800 --> 23:18.160
- It's gonna blow up!
- Back up! Back up! Back up!

23:18.200 --> 23:20.040
<i>Oh, my God! Back up!</i>

23:20.080 --> 23:21.480
I'm going as fast as I can!

23:25.400 --> 23:27.720
<i>Back up! Back up! Back up!</i>

23:32.040 --> 23:33.760
Stop! Quinn, stop!

23:33.840 --> 23:35.720
- Let me bloody go!
- No!

23:41.800 --> 23:42.760
No, Quinn!

23:47.480 --> 23:48.600
Devon's there!

23:51.760 --> 23:52.840
Devon!

23:54.360 --> 23:55.400
Devon!

24:02.120 --> 24:04.440
<i>He doesn't care about us.</i>

24:04.520 --> 24:07.080
<i>He just wants the damn ash
off that field.</i>

24:34.120 --> 24:36.520
Creedy's one-and-only black label,

24:36.600 --> 24:39.000
aged two weeks
in a steel barrel.

24:39.080 --> 24:40.680
Now, the secret's swallowing fast.

24:40.760 --> 24:43.680
That way it just burns your stomach
and not your throat.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.080
Go on.

24:47.120 --> 24:48.600
Sip it and weep.

24:48.680 --> 24:50.200
Poor bastard.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.000
Who? Eddie?

24:54.040 --> 24:55.440
A father's not meant to bury his kids.

24:55.520 --> 24:57.000
It's supposed to be
the other way around.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.200
Yeah, well,
he wouldn't have had to

24:58.280 --> 24:59.560
- if he'd just listened, would he?
- <i>No.</i>

24:59.600 --> 25:01.760
No, Creedy.
Maybe he was right.

25:01.840 --> 25:05.160
It's easy to square your shoulders
and bear it when you don't have kids.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.160
Maybe there won't be
another harvest.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.280
No. Not now,
with half the crop gone.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.680
God knows how we're going
to get through.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.840
You remember when we'd go out
and bring in 80%, 90% of it?

25:16.880 --> 25:18.600
Not anymore.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.840
Not in the last few years.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.480
<i>They're hungrier, too.</i>

25:22.560 --> 25:24.200
Hey...

25:24.240 --> 25:26.680
you're not giving up on me,
are you?

25:29.400 --> 25:31.280
No.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.000
I just thought
if we could hang on,

25:34.080 --> 25:36.480
somehow we'd make it through.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.520
<i>This is a national civil defense alert
for all who can hear this...</i>

25:52.560 --> 25:55.520
<i>...no choice but to authorize
the use of nuclear weapons...</i>

26:18.400 --> 26:21.680
<i>The sole survivor was
a 12-year-old boy...</i>

26:31.560 --> 26:33.480
<i>Roger that.</i>

26:33.560 --> 26:36.440
<i>I'm going in.
Stay high on my...</i>

26:36.520 --> 26:39.120
<i>Charge all weapons.</i>

26:41.960 --> 26:44.040
Hey, Barlow, I've got voices.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.880
Ajay, what are you smoking?

26:45.960 --> 26:47.840
I'm not messing with you, Barlow.

26:47.920 --> 26:48.800
Take a look.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.280
A look at what?

26:51.360 --> 26:52.720
She's not moving.

26:52.760 --> 26:55.200
Forget the bird
and use the scope, you wanker.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.080
Oh, dear.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.360
<i>Creedy!</i>

27:16.440 --> 27:17.640
<i>Creedy!</i>

27:17.680 --> 27:19.680
I've got to go.

27:23.640 --> 27:26.960
<i>All right, lads,
this isn't a drill!</i>

27:28.200 --> 27:29.800
<i>Move it along!</i>

27:29.840 --> 27:31.360
<i>Get those out.
One to Creedy.</i>

27:31.440 --> 27:32.880
<i>Another one to Jared!</i>

27:32.960 --> 27:34.840
Here's Creedy's.

27:34.920 --> 27:37.040
<i>All right, all right!
Come on, then! Come on!</i>

27:37.120 --> 27:38.120
Extra shells!

27:39.680 --> 27:41.000
<i>Come on!</i>

27:41.040 --> 27:42.560
<i>We haven't got all day!</i>

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
Marauders.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.160
Years since we've seen them.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.840
Well, look on the bright side.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.200
At least we're not alone.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.560
Oh.

29:20.640 --> 29:24.560
Only one thing worse than a dragon...

29:24.640 --> 29:26.080
Americans.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.320
Oh, what a dump.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.480
Who's in charge?!

29:43.880 --> 29:45.960
Well, that would be you, then.

29:57.040 --> 30:01.080
Anything happens,
you know what to do.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.720
Uh, no.
I have no idea.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.560
Me neither.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.720
That's a big tank.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.600
You responsible for this place?

30:41.680 --> 30:42.680
Who are you?

30:42.760 --> 30:45.040
Name's Van Zan,
Kentucky Irregulars.

30:45.080 --> 30:46.600
You're a long way from home,
Van Zan. You lost?

30:49.240 --> 30:52.560
Rebuilt a National Guard C5A.

30:52.640 --> 30:55.640
Flew it 8,000 miles on 2 engines
and tried to set it down

30:55.720 --> 30:59.280
<i>on the old strip
outside of Manchester.</i>

30:59.360 --> 31:02.520
<i>Lost 122 men and most of my fuel.</i>

31:02.600 --> 31:05.040
We need shelter and a place
to refit artillery.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.640
We'll be out of your hair
by 1800 hours tomorrow.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.000
That's a good story,
especially the bit about the plane,

31:10.040 --> 31:12.280
but there hasn't been
anything in the air for 20 years.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.480
That's their territory.

31:14.480 --> 31:17.400
It's my territory.
It's <i>your</i> territory.

31:17.480 --> 31:18.680
They're just rentin' it.

31:18.760 --> 31:19.960
Turn around, Van Zan.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.360
Don't be a fool.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.520
We can do this easy...

31:31.600 --> 31:35.560
or we can do it real easy.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.680
You try it.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.960
You ever seen one of these?

31:51.040 --> 31:53.280
Not many men have.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.520
Got it off the first one I killed.

31:57.720 --> 32:00.120
The plane was better.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.760
So now you're a dragon killer.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.760
That's not even original.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.360
It was in a wheat field

32:06.440 --> 32:09.880
just south of Coffeyville, Kansas.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.840
It was late November.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.760
It's a month of mist.

32:13.840 --> 32:15.920
And we were caught in the open.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.040
The sun was setting behind us.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.120
There was nowhere to run.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.800
Twice it came in on us,

32:21.840 --> 32:24.560
and twice it missed the heart of us.

32:27.520 --> 32:31.920
And that's when I had an epiphany.

32:32.000 --> 32:37.280
You see, they have great vision...
in the day.

32:37.360 --> 32:41.800
And they have
even better vision at night.

32:41.880 --> 32:44.840
But in the failing light,
they can't focus.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.120
Magic hour.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.160
Coffeyville.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.960
It's etched in American history

33:07.040 --> 33:09.640
because the outlaw Dalton boys
were killed there.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.160
Ordinary townsfolk rose up
and took 'em down.

33:14.840 --> 33:16.920
Maybe you're the Dalton boys.

33:17.000 --> 33:22.280
No, no...
we're the townsfolk.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.720
You try anything...

33:33.800 --> 33:36.120
I'll kill you.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.760
Didn't get your name.

33:41.840 --> 33:43.240
Quinn.

34:21.639 --> 34:23.520
Well... I'm sure you've got

34:23.600 --> 34:26.360
a perfectly good explanation for this,

34:26.440 --> 34:28.280
but I'm buggered
if I know what it is.

34:30.159 --> 34:31.880
He's a dragon slayer.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.560
A what?

34:33.639 --> 34:36.159
He's a dragon slayer!

34:36.280 --> 34:37.800
Oh, he's a dragon slayer.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.080
Oh, good.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.760
And I suppose that makes you
King Arthur, does it?

34:41.840 --> 34:44.040
Christ Almighty, Quinn.

34:44.080 --> 34:46.000
I mean, even if you believe that,

34:46.080 --> 34:48.000
and you'd have to be an imbecile,

34:48.080 --> 34:50.760
- do you not think we'd be easy meat for these guys?
- You weren't there.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.040
Look at this guy.
Look. Look.

34:52.080 --> 34:54.320
I mean, he looks like-- like a--
like a rogue Marine.

34:54.360 --> 34:57.560
You remember those guys?
Oh, yeah, sure.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.320
They blew up plenty of dragons
in their time,

34:59.400 --> 35:00.760
but they also took
half the world--

35:00.840 --> 35:02.760
You weren't there!
I saw his eyes, Creedy!

35:38.280 --> 35:40.600
<i>Move it! Move it! Move it!</i>

36:04.160 --> 36:05.800
Great job.

36:05.880 --> 36:09.160
We ran a 30-mile grid
in every direction-- nothing.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.120
Could be on the moon, Denton.

36:13.160 --> 36:17.920
Quinn, this is Alexandra Jensen,
U.S. Cavalry.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.640
Oh. Captain Creedy.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.640
Hey.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.640
How you doin'?
Creedy.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.160
Denton Van Zan.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.520
How are you?

36:25.600 --> 36:26.960
Excuse me.

36:27.040 --> 36:28.640
Who are they?

36:29.760 --> 36:31.080
Archangels.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.080
Huh?

36:32.120 --> 36:33.520
17 seconds...

36:33.560 --> 36:36.640
once they jump from the chopper,
that's their life expectancy.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.360
You never thought
of giving them parachutes?

36:39.440 --> 36:41.320
They're not much help.
They're bulla men.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.920
What?

36:43.000 --> 36:47.400
They were used by gladiators
to snare other men.

36:47.480 --> 36:50.040
Not men, dragons.

36:50.120 --> 36:53.640
So, you guys, uh,
jump out the chopper

36:53.800 --> 36:56.840
and use a net to snare dragons?

36:56.920 --> 36:58.400
Mm-hmm.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.080
Ha. I mean, sure, yeah.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.960
I mean you would, wouldn't you?

37:17.160 --> 37:20.640
Three watches, eight hours each.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.120
All the kids in the shelter.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.040
Rifles on the keep and walls.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.480
Excuse me.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.840
Aren't you forgetting
who let them in?

37:28.880 --> 37:31.400
Don't mean I trust 'em.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.320
All right, guys.

37:54.560 --> 37:58.000
I just brewed a fresh pot,
if that's what you're looking for.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.120
A whetstone, actually.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.160
Sure.

38:10.480 --> 38:11.960
Is that your son?

38:12.040 --> 38:15.400
No.
Got him from the pound.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.520
Hmm. Is that where you
get all your children?

38:23.000 --> 38:25.280
I found him in a village near Bray.

38:25.360 --> 38:27.640
<i>3 years old,
sitting with his mum.</i>

38:27.760 --> 38:29.880
<i>He kept trying to wake her up.</i>

38:29.960 --> 38:32.040
She had been dead for days.

38:33.640 --> 38:38.000
We were making our way up here, a few of us--
me, Creedy, and Barlow.

38:38.080 --> 38:40.000
No idea how we were gonna survive.

38:40.080 --> 38:43.520
Anyway, I grabbed him.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.160
What else was I gonna do?

38:45.160 --> 38:47.400
Leave him.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.360
Most men would have...

38:49.400 --> 38:51.640
especially back in the early years.

38:51.760 --> 38:54.440
Everybody's just running
for their lives.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.760
Yeah.
Well, I didn't.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.960
Regretted it ever since, of course.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.160
What are you doing here?

39:19.840 --> 39:22.120
What do you want?

39:23.600 --> 39:26.320
You want to know anything,
you ask Van Zan.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.120
Goosh, you alive?!

39:54.160 --> 39:55.640
Not even close, Denton.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.320
Alex! Radios are down!

40:02.400 --> 40:05.120
Cover the east ridge
and tell me what you see!

40:05.160 --> 40:06.960
Men, get ready to rock 'n' roll!

40:07.000 --> 40:08.320
We got a dragon to kill!

40:09.160 --> 40:11.160
- Goosh, set the triangulators!
- <i>Roger that!</i>

40:11.160 --> 40:14.480
<i>Tito, Mead, Piscatella,
bounce your butts!</i>

40:14.520 --> 40:17.480
<i>Move out!</i>

40:55.800 --> 40:57.640
Alex, what do you see?

40:59.080 --> 41:00.520
<i>No sign of it.</i>

41:00.600 --> 41:02.960
Visibility is about 3 miles
on the deck.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.040
<i>Roger that.</i>

41:04.080 --> 41:06.640
<i>Stay on the deck
till I get the verticals up.</i>

41:06.800 --> 41:09.120
<i>Copy that, Van Zan.</i>

41:09.160 --> 41:11.160
Waiting for triangulator.
Safety first, guys.

41:11.280 --> 41:13.800
Safety?! What part of this job
do you find safe?!

41:13.840 --> 41:16.280
It's not you I'm worried about.
It's my chopper.

41:16.360 --> 41:19.320
Oh. Cold.
Ha ha ha ha!

41:24.760 --> 41:26.160
<i>First vertical's up.</i>

41:26.280 --> 41:27.880
Vertical 1 up, Alex.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.480
Copy that.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.040
<i>Second vertical is up.</i>

41:40.120 --> 41:41.760
Second vertical is up, Alex.

41:41.840 --> 41:44.480
<i>Now, once I have radar,
you go to 5, 000 feet.</i>

41:44.560 --> 41:46.800
<i>Fly directly back above my location.</i>

41:46.840 --> 41:49.640
<i>Gideon, you and the boys bring that bitch
right down on my head,</i>

41:49.760 --> 41:50.920
<i>and I'll take it from there.</i>

41:50.960 --> 41:52.440
Copy that, Van Zan.

41:52.520 --> 41:54.640
Alvarez, you're the bait.

41:54.760 --> 41:56.080
Jefferson, you and I
are the gunners.

41:56.120 --> 41:57.640
<i>We don't open our chutes</i>

41:57.640 --> 42:01.640
until you give us confirmation
that it's down, right?

42:05.160 --> 42:07.160
Bogey on our tail, 200 yards!

42:07.320 --> 42:08.840
- <i>Go, go, go, go!</i>
- <i>Roger!</i>

42:08.920 --> 42:11.080
I'll try to lose it up
in the clouds.

42:19.160 --> 42:22.080
Piscatella, do you read me?

42:34.800 --> 42:37.640
<i>God damn it, Piscatella!
Get your vertical up!</i>

42:43.600 --> 42:46.400
<i>Come on, number 3!
Piscatella, that's you!</i>

42:46.480 --> 42:47.880
<i>I'm almost there!</i>

42:47.920 --> 42:49.360
<i>I'm almost at the top of the--</i>

42:55.560 --> 42:57.480
God damn it, Piscatella.
Come in.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.600
Ajay?

43:00.640 --> 43:03.040
<i>Can you hear anything?</i>

43:03.120 --> 43:04.520
<i>Van Zan's trying
to take it on, Quinn,</i>

43:04.560 --> 43:06.160
using some kind of 3-d mapping device.

43:06.320 --> 43:07.880
<i>If they don't get
that third vertical up,</i>

43:07.960 --> 43:09.480
<i>Alex is flying blind.</i>

43:16.920 --> 43:18.880
Come on!

43:22.000 --> 43:23.320
<i>Van Zan, what's going on?</i>

43:23.400 --> 43:25.920
<i>I'm at altitude.
We're blind up here.</i>

43:26.000 --> 43:29.560
Can you give me some time?
I'm having trouble with the third vertical.

43:32.400 --> 43:34.880
<i>Come on, number 3!
Piscatella, that's you!</i>

43:34.960 --> 43:36.040
<i>Get your vertical up!</i>

44:01.360 --> 44:02.440
<i>All right, Piscatella.</i>

44:02.480 --> 44:03.520
<i>Third vertical's up.</i>

44:03.600 --> 44:04.680
Alex, we have visual.

44:06.480 --> 44:07.520
Monitor's coming up.

44:11.160 --> 44:13.160
Hold on!

44:13.240 --> 44:15.080
<i>Alvarez!</i>

44:21.040 --> 44:23.320
<i>It's right on us!
It's right on us!</i>

44:23.400 --> 44:25.160
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

44:27.920 --> 44:28.640
Damn it!

44:30.800 --> 44:31.760
Talk to me, Alex!

44:31.800 --> 44:34.120
Angels are flying.

44:48.760 --> 44:51.240
<i>Alex, do you have a reading?!</i>

44:53.560 --> 44:55.240
Okay. Target-- 1,500 feet.

44:55.320 --> 44:58.520
Copy that.
Alvarez, do you have a visual?!

44:58.600 --> 45:00.600
Negative.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.280
Damn it!
It's right on top of me! Shoot!

45:05.360 --> 45:07.360
Shoot at what?!
I can't see a thing!

45:11.440 --> 45:13.360
<i>Nets away!</i>

45:16.720 --> 45:17.720
Great shot!

45:17.800 --> 45:19.600
<i>All right, Jefferson!</i>

45:19.640 --> 45:21.720
<i>Roger that.</i>

45:21.800 --> 45:23.840
Alvarez, can you see it?

45:23.920 --> 45:25.920
Negative.
I think it's down.

45:27.080 --> 45:28.680
Copy that.

45:29.560 --> 45:32.640
Shit! Alex, both nets
just flew right by me.

45:32.720 --> 45:35.640
Alvarez, can you confirm
that it is down?

45:36.400 --> 45:37.720
Copy that!

45:37.800 --> 45:41.560
<i>Negative! It's on me!</i>

45:57.160 --> 46:01.640
Jefferson, I'm not getting
any contact with Alvarez.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.040
Keep your eyes open.

46:03.120 --> 46:04.280
Roger that.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.160
- <i>Jefferson, look out!</i>
- Oh, my...

46:16.080 --> 46:17.480
<i>Gideon's down.</i>

46:19.480 --> 46:21.360
<i>Piscatella.</i>

46:21.400 --> 46:23.560
- <i>Piscatella, do you read me?</i>
- Van Zan.

46:23.600 --> 46:24.760
Who is this?

46:24.840 --> 46:25.720
<i>Quinn.</i>

46:25.800 --> 46:27.000
<i>Quinn, where's Piscatella?</i>

46:27.080 --> 46:28.880
- He's gone.
- <i>Are you ready to ride?</i>

46:28.920 --> 46:31.400
'Cause you got about 30 seconds
till the bitch is on top of you.

46:31.480 --> 46:32.640
<i>You bring her to me.</i>

46:32.720 --> 46:35.840
You're the bait, Quinn,
1,600 pounds of horseflesh.

46:35.920 --> 46:38.160
<i>Ride her right down my throat.
Do you read me?</i>

46:38.240 --> 46:39.880
<i>Ride the north road to the quarry.</i>

46:39.920 --> 46:41.280
Bring her to me, Quinn.

46:44.160 --> 46:45.720
I'm coming.

46:48.360 --> 46:50.280
Hmm? Here we go.

46:55.440 --> 46:56.800
Okay. Okay.

46:59.320 --> 47:01.400
Come on!

47:01.480 --> 47:06.040
Line up 20 yards south by southwest!

47:06.120 --> 47:08.200
Come on!

47:16.200 --> 47:17.800
Come on!

47:21.480 --> 47:22.840
<i>1,200 yards.</i>

47:22.920 --> 47:26.600
<i>Wind velocity--
10.2 north by northwest.</i>

47:26.640 --> 47:28.840
Come on! Come on!

48:50.600 --> 48:52.680
Yeah, this is really good stuff.
Thanks.

48:52.720 --> 48:54.720
<i>I don't a-care about that</i>

48:54.800 --> 48:56.400
- <i>Got a new fool</i>
- Hey, good day, Quinn, yeah?

48:56.480 --> 48:58.200
- <i>I'd like to laugh at</i>
- All right, Quinn.

48:58.280 --> 49:00.160
<i>I have only one burning desire</i>

49:00.240 --> 49:01.480
Hats off to you, mate.

49:01.560 --> 49:03.480
Yeah!

49:14.680 --> 49:16.800
<i>...stand, baby</i>

49:16.880 --> 49:19.200
<i>Listen here, baby</i>

49:19.280 --> 49:21.400
<i>And stop actin' so crazy</i>

49:21.480 --> 49:23.080
<i>You say your mom ain't home</i>

49:23.120 --> 49:24.680
<i>It ain't my concern</i>

49:24.720 --> 49:26.120
<i>Just a-play with me</i>

49:26.160 --> 49:28.320
<i>And you won't get burned</i>

49:28.400 --> 49:31.400
<i>I have only one itchin' desire</i>

49:31.480 --> 49:34.320
<i>Let me stand next to your fire</i>

49:34.360 --> 49:36.280
<i>Let me stand, yeah</i>

49:36.360 --> 49:39.120
<i>Let me stand, baby</i>

49:39.200 --> 49:40.280
<i>Let me stand</i>

49:53.680 --> 49:56.680
Envy the country
that has heroes, huh?!

50:02.920 --> 50:06.200
I say pity the country
that needs 'em.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.840
<i>What are you celebrating?</i>

50:12.920 --> 50:16.840
<i>One dragon down, three men dead?
Oh, yeah.</i>

50:16.920 --> 50:21.160
At that rate, we might just be
getting somewhere in about 320 years.

50:21.200 --> 50:24.200
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

50:24.280 --> 50:26.720
<i>You want a little accommodation?</i>

50:26.800 --> 50:29.040
Unh-unh.

50:29.120 --> 50:32.160
These beasts live on ash.

50:32.240 --> 50:34.840
<i>They feed on death.</i>

50:34.920 --> 50:37.320
There's no middle ground...

50:37.360 --> 50:42.320
not for them, not for us.

50:42.400 --> 50:46.200
And sure as hell not for my men
who died out there today.

50:50.760 --> 50:53.880
But you go ahead.

50:53.960 --> 50:59.400
Have your little... <i>soiree.</i>

50:59.480 --> 51:01.480
Personally, you disgust me.

51:08.600 --> 51:10.960
We bury our dead at dawn.

52:23.180 --> 52:24.640
What are you doing here, Quinn?

52:26.280 --> 52:30.400
You're standing on ground
where I've buried hundreds.

52:30.480 --> 52:31.680
This is my home.

52:31.760 --> 52:34.480
<i>I'm asking the questions.</i>

52:34.520 --> 52:35.880
What are <i>you</i> doing here?

52:38.040 --> 52:41.400
I lead... you follow.

53:02.360 --> 53:04.240
I kept these for you.

53:04.280 --> 53:07.400
They sent them off proud, Alex.

53:07.480 --> 53:10.280
Alex is the keeper of the dead, Quinn.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.400
She's our memory.

53:11.480 --> 53:13.320
When this thing is over,

53:13.360 --> 53:15.560
she's gonna build a wall
with those things.

53:15.600 --> 53:18.360
<i>And, unfortunately,
it's gonna be a very long wall.</i>

53:18.440 --> 53:20.520
I'm out of resources, Quinn.

53:20.600 --> 53:22.480
I'm out of men.

53:22.520 --> 53:24.120
<i>Alex, tell him.</i>

53:25.200 --> 53:26.800
<i>Did you see the one we brought down,
the big bull?</i>

53:26.800 --> 53:27.840
Yeah.

53:27.920 --> 53:30.160
Well, it wasn't.
It was a female.

53:30.240 --> 53:33.040
There was at least one egg,
probably more.

53:33.080 --> 53:36.520
We've hit over 200 of them,
and as far as we can tell,

53:36.600 --> 53:38.200
they're all females.

53:38.280 --> 53:40.840
How about you, Quinn?
You ever seen a male?

53:40.880 --> 53:41.800
I don't know.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.200
When I'm running for my life,

53:43.280 --> 53:44.920
I don't stop to look at the plumbing.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.840
Well, we have.

53:46.920 --> 53:49.080
Alex discovered it about two years back.

53:49.200 --> 53:51.560
She worked out
how the fire in the glands--

53:51.600 --> 53:54.200
Two glands in the mouth
secrete separate chemicals, yep.

53:54.280 --> 53:55.320
That's right.

53:55.400 --> 53:58.280
Combine in exhalation-- nitro-napalm.

53:58.320 --> 54:00.600
Yeah. Well, the chemical engineer
is dead now.

54:00.680 --> 54:01.640
That was his theory.

54:01.720 --> 54:04.000
We figure they're like fish.

54:04.080 --> 54:06.040
The females spawn the eggs.

54:06.120 --> 54:09.920
One male passes over
and fertilizes thousands.

54:10.000 --> 54:11.920
Did you hear what she said, Quinn?

54:12.000 --> 54:13.320
One male.

54:13.360 --> 54:15.960
That's why we never see any others,
'cause there's only one.

54:16.040 --> 54:17.880
Now, we tracked
the epidemiology of these things,

54:17.960 --> 54:19.440
and we found out
where they're from.

54:19.520 --> 54:20.720
And that is why we're here.

54:20.840 --> 54:26.000
<i>We kill the male,
we kill the species.</i>

54:26.040 --> 54:27.800
We're going to London.

54:27.880 --> 54:30.440
Good luck.
It's that way.

54:30.520 --> 54:32.640
<i>No, I need soldiers.</i>

54:32.720 --> 54:35.720
- Quinn, are you listening to me? I need men--
- <i>Men from Pembury went to London.</i>

54:35.800 --> 54:38.200
And maybe she's right,
because they disturbed something.

54:38.280 --> 54:39.320
90 of them died,

54:39.400 --> 54:41.320
and then it backtracked them
to their fortress.

54:41.360 --> 54:43.440
And you haven't seen
destruction like that, Van Zan...

54:43.520 --> 54:44.480
not even in this world.

54:44.560 --> 54:45.640
So we walk over dead men--

54:45.720 --> 54:47.440
Not with my people, you won't!

54:47.520 --> 54:49.320
I've got a castle full of them.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.080
I'm trying to keep them alive.

54:51.160 --> 54:53.920
You're just letting them die slower.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.880
I said no.

54:55.960 --> 54:57.880
I made a mistake letting you
through those gates.

54:57.960 --> 55:00.520
I saw something in your eyes.
I thought it was awe. I was wrong.

55:00.600 --> 55:02.600
It's madness.
You're insane.

55:02.680 --> 55:05.640
And I want you out
before you do more damage.

55:11.080 --> 55:13.480
Look out the window.

55:13.520 --> 55:16.320
Eden's not burning.
It's burnt.

55:25.080 --> 55:27.720
Why don't you want to go?

55:30.320 --> 55:32.720
What happened there?

55:34.800 --> 55:38.320
My mother was working on a railway tunnel--
project engineer.

55:38.400 --> 55:40.480
She died there, okay?

55:44.040 --> 55:46.520
You've seen it, haven't you?

55:50.800 --> 55:52.760
<i>Quinn!</i>

55:52.840 --> 55:54.920
Trouble.

55:58.200 --> 56:00.160
There's nothing magical about 'em.

56:00.240 --> 56:02.320
They're made up
of a collection of organs.

56:02.360 --> 56:04.320
They have a mind, a heart,
and a liver.

56:04.400 --> 56:06.960
You take out one of these,
you bring down the beast!

56:11.960 --> 56:15.520
Is that it?
Four of you?

56:18.200 --> 56:19.600
Eddie.

56:19.640 --> 56:21.840
Eddie, what you doin'?

56:21.880 --> 56:23.640
You got kids, man.

56:23.720 --> 56:27.040
That's why I'm going, Creedy.
That's why.

56:30.240 --> 56:33.240
The volunteer section of this campaign's now over.
It's time for the draft.

56:33.320 --> 56:35.120
Tito, Mead...

56:35.160 --> 56:36.920
get the six strongest men they have
and load 'em up.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.160
- Right.
- Got it.

56:38.200 --> 56:40.640
Dig your own holes.
Die in 'em.

56:42.680 --> 56:44.320
Oi!

56:44.400 --> 56:45.520
I said no!

56:45.560 --> 56:46.360
No, Quinn!

56:51.960 --> 56:53.560
Get out of my way, Quinn.

57:27.600 --> 57:29.400
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

57:29.480 --> 57:31.400
<i>Get him off!</i>

57:31.480 --> 57:38.160
I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!

57:38.200 --> 57:39.440
- That's what we need.
- <i>I'll kill ya!</i>

57:39.520 --> 57:42.120
He's gonna bring it back here!

57:42.440 --> 57:44.040
<i>All right.</i>

57:44.120 --> 57:46.720
<i>All right, he's had enough.</i>

57:51.200 --> 57:52.560
Go, London!

57:56.160 --> 57:58.640
Come on!
Move 'em out!

57:58.680 --> 58:00.720
Come on!
Grab those guys!

58:07.560 --> 58:09.520
<i>You, you, you!</i>

58:25.600 --> 58:27.000
He would have killed you.

58:27.080 --> 58:28.360
He doesn't feel things.

58:28.440 --> 58:31.920
That's the only way
he can do what he does.

58:33.720 --> 58:35.360
Here. Take this.

58:35.440 --> 58:37.640
Iodine.

58:37.720 --> 58:40.400
Hurts like hell,
but it kills anything.

59:08.120 --> 59:10.480
Good luck, Quinn.

59:37.400 --> 59:40.360
You too busy to say goodbye?

59:40.440 --> 59:41.840
You're not my father.

59:41.920 --> 59:43.200
You can't stop me, Quinn.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.360
I can be an archangel.

59:45.400 --> 59:47.040
Gideon says he'll teach me.

59:47.120 --> 59:48.680
17 seconds.

59:48.760 --> 59:50.720
Did he tell you
that's how long they live?

59:50.800 --> 59:53.080
Not the good ones.
Gideon's an 8-year veteran.

59:53.160 --> 59:54.560
At least they're still killing them.

59:54.640 --> 59:58.640
A couple of years, Jared.
That's all I'm asking for. Give me that.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:01.600
After that, you'll be old enough,
and you can lead 'em.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:04.240
That's what I want.
Out of everyone, you're the best.

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.200
It's a waste of time, Quinn--
all of it.

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:10.520
You're right.
I'm not your father.

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.880
I can't... lock you in.
I can't make you stay.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.840
And if you think you're man enough
to speak like that,

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.920
then I guess
you're man enough to go.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.480
Goodbye, Jared.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:35.320
You look after yourself.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.120
<i>That dragon smells like shit.</i>

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.240
Are you gonna burn it?

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.360
I love it.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.360
They hate the smell of their dead.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.600
It's the only thing that scares 'em.

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:20.960
It might buy us a couple of days.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.960
Sorry, Quinn.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.640
So am I.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.320
This time I was thinking
I got rid of you for sure.

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:08.560
<i>Van Zan, what are we doing?</i>

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:11.160
Do you see a way through?

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.880
<i>Negative.
It's blocked for miles.</i>

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.160
As far as the river, Denton.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.480
Head back, Alex.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.360
- <i>Find me a way around.</i>
- Copy.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.520
Is this Pembury?

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:34.600
This looks like Pembury.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:35.920
Do you want to turn back?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.520
<i>Nukes must have done this.</i>

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.200
Nukes didn't do this.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:40.880
Should we set the triangulators?

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:49.120
No time.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.280
Man the 50-cal, lock and load,

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.240
cut the engines,
and take your positions.

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.120
You heard him!
Lock and load!

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.120
<i>Let's move! Let's move!</i>

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.000
<i>I think it's playing with us.</i>

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:29.800
It's not playing with us.

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:31.760
It's setting us up.

01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.480
Easy. Easy.

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.360
Easy, girl.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.480
Van Zan, it's Alex.
Can you read me?

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.520
<i>Van Zan, can you hear me?</i>

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.680
<i>Van Zan, if you can hear me,
I'm coming back.</i>

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.560
<i>Can anybody hear me?</i>

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:10.160
<i>Van Zan!</i>

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:21.880
Denton...

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.000
<i>what happened?</i>

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.920
It was him.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:33.680
<i>Where are the soldiers?</i>

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.840
<i>One pass.</i>

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.720
<i>He flew over just once.</i>

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:48.319
<i>The castle.</i>

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.880
Get the hell out of there!
Take cover, everybody!

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.319
<i>Get it moving!</i>

01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:42.399
Anybody upstairs?!

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.160
Jared!

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.280
- Creedy!
- <i>Quinn!</i>

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.800
Have you got them all?

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.120
<i>Creedy, help!</i>

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.920
I'll get him!
You take her downstairs!

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.680
<i>Hurry up! That big boy won't stop
until it's killed us all!</i>

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.560
<i>Katie-- she won't move.</i>

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.320
Come on, Katie.
Willem, get on my shoulder.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:08.680
Katie, come on.
Let go of the wall.

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.160
Let go. Let go!

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.560
Take her! Take her!

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:35.320
<i>Everybody, move to the back!</i>

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.800
I've got all the kids.
Okay, keep pushing up.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.640
Katie's blanket.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.320
Where is everyone?!

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.960
Don't you go up there, Quinn!

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:57.320
There's 65 people up there, Creedy.
I'm going!

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.960
<i>God damn it, Quinn.</i>

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.080
Don't you dare leave!
It's too dangerous!

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.320
I'll clean it up.

01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:03.880
Creedy!

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.080
<i>No!</i>

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.560
Creedy!

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.320
No!

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.400
No!

01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:54.000
<i>Creedy!</i>

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:01.080
What do we do when we wake?

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.960
Keep both eyes on the sky.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.280
What do we do...

01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.120
What do we...

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.680
What do we do when we sleep?

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:18.800
Keep one eye on the sky.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.040
What do we do when we see him?

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.840
Dig hard, dig deep, run for shelter,

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:27.280
and never look back.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.640
Jared...

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.920
We're alive!

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.720
We're in here!

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.960
Push!

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.560
<i>Back away!</i>

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.280
<i>You were right.</i>

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.040
I salvaged what I could
from your armory.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.600
<i>We got one rifle,</i>

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:49.720
two automatics, two crossbows,

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.680
and explosive heads.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.080
You, me, and Alex--

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.920
<i>down the coast in the chopper.</i>

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.400
Stay tight to the cliffs.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:09.240
The Thames will take us right into
the heart of London.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.960
<i>I know where he lives.</i>

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:15.120
Magic hour--

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.240
you say that's when
they're the weakest.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.840
We'll see.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.960
You're going home.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:24.800
Jared!

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.720
Yeah, Quinn?

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.720
You keep them safe.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:57.360
Well, this town's gone to hell.

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.400
They must have heard us coming.

01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:03.120
What's stopping them?

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.200
It's not us.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.960
Either way, we gotta get in there.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.680
Come on, guys.
We're outnumbered hundreds to 3.

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.280
I know this city
from the sky down,

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.760
and I know it
from the bottom up.

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:17.240
<i>If we can get in quiet,
I can sneak us into some tunnels.</i>

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.280
<i>That should get us close.</i>

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:26.560
Good Christ.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.360
Did he see us?

01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:48.320
<i>They must be starving.
They're eating their own.</i>

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:52.320
Oh, we're dead.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:54.560
Look on the bright side.

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.520
Now we've got <i>him</i>
outnumbered 3 to 1.

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:03.120
Now... you ready?

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.760
Yeah.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.840
Quinn...

01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:09.520
You lead. We follow.

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.520
There's an underground passage--

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:42.680
leads to the construction site!

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.640
Down here!

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:05.000
Clear.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:24.080
Four tunnels meet at this shaft.

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:25.840
Leads up to a square.
There used to be buildings up there.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.280
If they're still around,
could be good coverage.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.560
Yeah, if it goes to the street,
that's what we take.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:30.800
Alex, give me the sticks.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.840
Quinn, these are
highly volatile heads.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.640
You fire them with your crossbow.

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:43.280
Now, when you...

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.160
<i>He knows we're here. Shh.</i>

01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:50.000
Okay.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.960
How tall is that shaft?

01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.400
150 feet.

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.720
<i>All right.
Here's the plan--</i>

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:00.320
when we get to street level, we gotta
bring that bull's ass to the ground,

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.240
<i>and I'm gonna take care of that.</i>

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.080
Now, one shot's gonna kill him,
and it's gonna be with this.

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:06.840
<i>He only exposes his chest
before he breathes fire.</i>

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:09.200
<i>Now, these are magnesium-tip
C-4 arrows,</i>

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.760
<i>and they only fly about 50 feet.</i>

01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:12.760
<i>So, when you fire,
you gotta be standing in the furnace.</i>

01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.600
So do not hesitate.
If you do, we die.

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.320
<i>Ah, he's playing hide-and-seek.</i>

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:27.160
<i>More like cat and mouse.</i>

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:53.320
<i>Quinn!</i>

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.600
Use it!

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.800
Oh, he's eating it up.

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:18.040
<i>I can't see a damn thing, Quinn.</i>

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:20.080
<i>What am I looking at?</i>

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.760
<i>This is an enclosed square.
It's about 100 meters across.</i>

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.560
<i>There's a building
right in the middle.</i>

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.520
<i>That chimney looks down
over the lot of it.</i>

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.280
<i>What do you think?</i>

01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.320
I don't know yet.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.240
Hey...

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.560
you scared?

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.200
No.

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.320
It was your idea to come to London.

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.320
Yeah, I thought
I'd be at 3,500 feet.

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:50.280
Yeah, I thought I'd have over
200 men with me right now.

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.600
Life's got a funny way of turning
out different, though, don't it?

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:54.880
Yeah.

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:02.240
See that railcar?

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.320
<i>It'll give us a better view.</i>

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:06.880
Move.

01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.840
<i>Drop your packs--
weapons only.</i>

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.120
Okay, we're gonna have a window--

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.120
10, maybe 12 seconds every time
he makes a turn, and we're gonna use it.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.320
- How?
- <i>We're gonna split up.</i>

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:52.560
We stay together, take a hit,
and we're gone,

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:54.080
so we gotta use every angle.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.320
Now, Quinn, you're gonna take
that west wall.

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:59.080
<i>Don't lock and load till you get there.
You got it?</i>

01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.040
Okay. What about you?

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.200
I got the north.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:06.240
Alex, I need you to stay right here.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.080
Now, when Quinn and I make a move,
it's gonna draw him off,

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:11.320
and I don't think
the son of a bitch can count.

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:14.280
Now, he's gonna make another turn.

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.600
<i>When he does,
I'm gonna tell you to go.</i>

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.640
You're gonna run like hell to that east wall.
Don't think about it--

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:19.680
It's water!

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:22.160
Keep it.
You're gonna need it.

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:29.400
We have paid a terrible price.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.800
And now we got a chance
to make a difference.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.120
We will.

01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.880
Now, that's our first window.

01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:02.960
Quinn...

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.320
Move!

01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.080
The arrows.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.920
Alex!

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.800
<i>In about 8 seconds,
we're gonna have a window!</i>

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.800
<i>Now, when I tell you to go,</i>

01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:27.600
<i>you run like hell straight
to the base of this chimney!</i>

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.960
<i>Are you ready?!</i>

01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.160
<i>Go! Go!</i>

01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:37.840
No!

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:44.960
Run like the wind, baby!

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:55.880
Come on, big boy!

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.320
That's right.

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.560
<i>Quinn!</i>

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.440
Alex!

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.000
Stop!

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.840
I'm fine.

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.640
What are we gonna do?

01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.480
I lost the explosives.

01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:08.240
We're gonna find 'em.

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.160
Keep going!

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.000
Go around the other side!

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.640
I'll slow him down!

01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.320
He's not moving.
He's waiting for us.

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:53.600
Quinn... by the truck-- the arrow.

01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:56.160
<i>By the wheel.</i>

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:23.960
No!

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:29.680
Die!

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:40.040
He always thought you could do it.

01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:43.760
And you did.

01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:51.640
Come on.

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:30.160
Quinn! Quinn! Quinn!

01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.280
We got a signal!
Quinn!

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:33.760
We got a signal.

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.880
Well, what's the problem?

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.920
They're speaking French.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.520
Well, don't come to me.
I'm lousy at French.

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.520
They want to speak
to the person in charge.

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:48.080
Well, that would be you, then.

01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:50.320
<i>Just keep 'em talking.</i>

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:54.960
Get us a good bottle of wine
or something.

01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.400
Go on, now.

01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:57.960
Thanks, Quinn.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.640
Go on, all of you.

01:32:01.720 --> 01:32:05.040
- All right. Cheers.
- Well done!

01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:08.520
You think it'll last?

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.400
I don't know.

01:32:10.480 --> 01:32:12.840
It's been, what, three months

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.960
since we saw the last one?

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:19.200
If they come, they'll burn,
we'll build.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.080
Or maybe I'll just kill 'em.

01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.440
And here I thought

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:25.840
optimism was against your nature.

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.160
It's a recent development.

01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:34.680
Well, here's to evolution.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:24.520
<i>These embers burn down low</i>

01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:33.480
<i>And with my face aglow</i>

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:43.080
<i>You are all I know</i>

01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:46.800
<i>Set this place on fire</i>

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:50.200
<i>Let the flames rise higher</i>

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:54.120
<i>And as they reach the ceiling</i>

01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.720
<i>At your feet I'm kneeling</i>

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:12.920
<i>Drawing ever near</i>

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:21.840
<i>My cause revealed as clear</i>

01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:31.880
<i>Yes, I burn for you here</i>

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:35.480
<i>Set this place on fire</i>

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:39.000
<i>Let the flames rise higher</i>

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:42.840
<i>And as they reach the ceiling</i>

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:46.880
<i>At your feet I'm kneeling</i>

01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:52.800
<i>With every trailing plume</i>

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:57.480
<i>Know it bears me home</i>

01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:06.680
<i>Let it burn</i>

01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:13.840
<i>Let it burn</i>

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.720
<i>Find me</i>

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.520
<i>I'm falling</i>

01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:43.000
<i>And fooling myself that it's flight</i>

01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.880
<i>Imperfect</i>

01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.680
<i>I plummet</i>

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.280
<i>And ponder</i>

01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.720
<i>Pushed away on principle</i>

01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:55.400
<i>Walk away and I stare</i>

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:58.920
<i>Would you stand me up again?</i>

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:02.440
<i>Wonder if I've said too much</i>

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:06.920
<i>And we'll never speak again</i>

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:13.680
<i>Forfeit</i>

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.440
<i>My future</i>

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:19.160
<i>For feelings of few far betweens</i>

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.760
<i>Mindless</i>

01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.920
<i>Of merciful</i>

01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:24.200
<i>Measures</i>

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.920
<i>Making ends preempt the means</i>

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.320
<i>And I searched your eyes for an answer</i>

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:34.720
<i>And shuddered at what I found there</i>

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:38.240
<i>As my skin shrunk away from conclusion</i>

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:41.960
<i>That you lack the strength to care</i>

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.480
<i>Walk away and I stare</i>

01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:49.000
<i>Would you stand me up again?</i>

01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:52.680
<i>Wonder if I've said too much</i>

01:36:52.720 --> 01:37:00.400
<i>And we'll never speak again</i>

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.600
<i>Never speak again</i>

01:37:04.305 --> 01:37:10.329
