WEBVTT

00:01.129 --> 00:03.929
(sirens)

00:03.997 --> 00:08.100
Magnus. Just the name screams
"super criminal genius guy".

00:08.167 --> 00:10.207
Prison psych team
tested his I.Q.

00:10.299 --> 00:12.466
He scored off the charts,
apparently.

00:12.534 --> 00:15.102
Why don't you just tell me what
the hell it is you're up to?

00:15.170 --> 00:18.172
Maybe it's all a misdirect,
like a magician.

00:18.239 --> 00:21.108
- Gregory Harrow?
- Hey, what's up?

00:21.176 --> 00:24.477
A little over five years ago,
Gregory Harrow is suspected

00:24.545 --> 00:26.096
of murdering a woman
in college: Andrea Fry.

00:26.215 --> 00:28.783
I need you to find
Magnus' link to the case.

00:28.851 --> 00:31.219
Who's Andrea Fry?

00:31.286 --> 00:34.387
Who are you?

00:34.455 --> 00:37.791
Andrea Fry is Magnus' daughter.

00:37.859 --> 00:40.460
- You're on a mission for justice.
- Do you believe in evil,

00:40.528 --> 00:42.863
- Mr. Logan?
- So what are you in for?

00:42.931 --> 00:44.798
I have many sins
to account for.

00:44.866 --> 00:46.667
- Couldn't escape,
so he did the next best thing:

00:46.735 --> 00:49.369
- he brought Harrow to him.
- Into the same damn cell.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.708
Our appointment with destiny
has merely been delayed.

01:02.016 --> 01:05.618

01:15.161 --> 01:17.129
Mr. Wyle,

01:17.196 --> 01:20.899
I hope you have
some good news for me.

01:25.170 --> 01:27.104
Guy's been through six lawyers
in the last two months.

01:27.172 --> 01:30.174
I guess nobody's crazy enough
to stay on the case.

01:30.241 --> 01:33.077
(chuckle)

01:47.758 --> 01:50.493
(siren)

01:50.561 --> 01:53.563
Hey, how did it go, man?

01:53.630 --> 01:56.431
It was good, dude.
Paramedic skills still intact.

01:56.499 --> 01:58.433
Like there was
any doubt, come on!

01:58.501 --> 02:01.804
So Sandra's sick with the flu, huh? You got it?
It's been going around.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.840
- Yeah, this thing's been a killer. Dodged a bullet, there!
- Too bad you weren't riding

02:04.908 --> 02:08.410
with me, though. Bonnie and Clyde, back at it.
You'd be Bonnie, of course.

02:08.477 --> 02:10.544
You're a better Bonnie.
You look good as a blonde.

02:10.613 --> 02:12.414
You know, you're not the first
person to tell me that.

02:12.481 --> 02:14.716
Well, it's not me that makes
the schedules, man. It's Ryder.

02:14.783 --> 02:16.718
Yeah. And ever since Elyse
got transferred, Ryder's been

02:16.785 --> 02:19.821
sticking me with every mouth
breather under the sun.

02:19.888 --> 02:21.856
- Mr. Bey, need you on the rig.
- Hey, sir.

02:21.924 --> 02:24.759
Oh! Yes, sir.
And who am I riding with today?

02:24.827 --> 02:27.561
Me.

02:27.629 --> 02:29.763
I take it
that you have an issue

02:29.831 --> 02:32.032
- with my scheduling?
- No, no!

02:32.100 --> 02:34.000
- Think you can do a better job?
- No, not at all.

02:34.068 --> 02:36.069
May I ask why

02:36.137 --> 02:38.105
I have the pleasure
of your company today, sir?

02:38.172 --> 02:40.574
Well, I'm not just
a supervisor, I am a paramedic.

02:40.642 --> 02:42.808
And as a paramedic,
I like to keep my skills fresh.

02:42.876 --> 02:44.777
Oh! You've come
to the right place.

02:44.845 --> 02:47.046
His skills are very fresh,
sir. I can vouch for that.

02:47.114 --> 02:49.482
Hmm.

02:49.550 --> 02:51.484
I feel like today
is going to be a long day.

02:51.552 --> 02:53.653
- Good luck, Bonnie.
- Toodle-loo, Clyde!

03:07.767 --> 03:10.935
Give him a minute.

03:23.382 --> 03:26.684
OK, Magnus. Let's go.

03:28.887 --> 03:32.322
Got some bad news? I guess you won't
be getting out of here anytime soon.

03:32.390 --> 03:35.225
I think I'll stick around.

03:35.293 --> 03:38.262
Lockdown! Put us in lockdown!

03:45.381 --> 03:50.938
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

03:56.999 --> 03:58.784
About a half hour ago,
a unit recovered

03:58.904 --> 04:01.301
Magnus's abandoned vehicle
there, near 16th Avenue.

04:01.428 --> 04:03.135
- Have you been in touch --
- ...with metro? Yeah.

04:03.255 --> 04:04.880
It's the first thing I did.
They got roadblocks set up

04:05.000 --> 04:08.533
- in a three-kilometre radius.
- Local airports?

04:08.601 --> 04:10.509
I already briefed airport
security, they got Magnus' photo

04:10.629 --> 04:12.020
and all his knowns. He's not
going to fly anywhere today.

04:12.140 --> 04:15.607
- OK. Easy on the caffeine.
- OK, look, I think we all know

04:15.674 --> 04:18.007
we won't be able to track Magnus
using conventional methods.

04:18.076 --> 04:20.476
His I.Q. is off the charts,
he is extremely resourceful

04:20.545 --> 04:23.079
and he will always stay
ten steps ahead of us.

04:23.147 --> 04:25.382
I've been in a lot of people's
minds, nothing like Magnus.

04:25.450 --> 04:28.017
Trying to get a read on him is
like trying to hold on to a jet.

04:28.085 --> 04:31.154
We need to think faster
and figure out where he's going

04:31.222 --> 04:33.156
- and get there before him.
- Michelle,

04:33.224 --> 04:35.391
you know him better than
anybody. Where's he heading?

04:35.459 --> 04:37.360
This is pretty easy: Gregory
Harrow. He killed his daughter,

04:37.427 --> 04:40.529
- he's going to take him out.
- That's what I thought at first

04:40.597 --> 04:43.099
but... take a look at that.

04:43.167 --> 04:46.201
Gregory's dead?
Last I heard, he was in jail.

04:46.269 --> 04:48.603
Gregory was released
after six months.

04:48.671 --> 04:52.174
His father paid for the best litigators
in the city, got him out on appeal.

04:52.242 --> 04:55.978
- A few days later, his card was
punched: motorcycle accident.

04:56.045 --> 04:57.946
The fickle hands of faith
cast him a smackdown.

04:58.014 --> 05:00.782
- You can't cheat justice.
But the question remains:

05:00.849 --> 05:02.817
- where is Magnus heading?
- He could be coming after you,

05:02.885 --> 05:04.986
Michelle. I mean,
you put him in jail twice.

05:05.053 --> 05:06.888
No. He's not after me. It was
a game for him between us.

05:06.955 --> 05:08.856
Magnus has a specific goal.

05:08.924 --> 05:10.691
It's believed
he has a sizeable nest egg,

05:10.759 --> 05:12.760
possibly in the Caribbean.

05:12.828 --> 05:14.461
50 million still unaccounted
for. They never found it.

05:14.529 --> 05:17.330
Then, we search again. If he's
trying to leave the country,

05:17.398 --> 05:19.766
then we have
a very short window.

05:19.834 --> 05:21.868
Dev, you keep in close contact
with metro. Can you put out

05:21.936 --> 05:23.837
a system-wide alert
to all the federal agencies?

05:23.905 --> 05:26.639
You and I are going to go talk
to Magnus' accomplice.

05:26.707 --> 05:28.541
Have you ever been
to Kingston Pen?

05:28.609 --> 05:31.077
First time for everything.
Decaf.

05:43.957 --> 05:45.724
You're the litigator
Robin Wise.

05:45.792 --> 05:47.726
Sorry. I work
by referral only.

05:47.794 --> 05:50.695
- Hmm...
- Do I know you?

05:50.762 --> 05:53.397
Oh, we haven't met.
Magnus Elphrenson.

05:53.465 --> 05:55.233
Please, stay.

05:55.301 --> 05:57.735
I could scream for help.

05:57.803 --> 06:00.438
That would change the tone of
this conversation very abruptly.

06:01.573 --> 06:04.075
- Can I take this?
- Could I have a coffee, please?

06:04.143 --> 06:06.844
Thank you.

06:06.911 --> 06:09.012
What do you want from me?

06:09.080 --> 06:12.182
I consider myself
a very resourceful man,

06:12.250 --> 06:16.153
a man who can find
the answer to any question.

06:16.221 --> 06:20.257
But there are some questions
even I can't answer.

06:24.627 --> 06:26.562
I was watching them
on the monitor the whole time.

06:26.629 --> 06:29.531
Looked like
any other legal meeting.

06:29.599 --> 06:32.134
Thank you.

06:38.374 --> 06:41.109
So, what are you thinking?

06:41.177 --> 06:45.480
From meeting with the other
lawyers, Magnus knew the drill.

06:48.050 --> 06:51.519
While the guard was bringing
Magnus from his cell,

06:51.587 --> 06:54.821
<i>Magnus' accomplice put an</i>
<i>induction shunt on the camera.</i>

06:54.890 --> 06:57.858
<i>It hijacked the signal</i>
<i>and fed it to a recorder,</i>

06:57.926 --> 06:59.894
<i>which captured 20 seconds</i>

06:59.961 --> 07:02.529
<i>of them talking quietly</i>
<i>at the table...</i>

07:02.597 --> 07:05.299
<i>...played it back in a loop</i>
<i>into the guard's station.</i>

07:05.367 --> 07:08.302
<i>It was seamless.</i>

07:08.370 --> 07:11.304
<i>Gave them ample time to open</i>
<i>Magnus' cuffs, change clothes,</i>

07:11.372 --> 07:13.640
<i>change hair...</i>
<i>By the time the camera</i>

07:13.708 --> 07:17.310
<i>was turned on again, the guy
already had his head in his hands.</i>

07:17.378 --> 07:20.747
- The guard said it wasn't more than two or three minutes.
- That's all he'd need.

07:20.815 --> 07:24.451
Magnus would have been
practicing this for months.

07:24.519 --> 07:26.585
Let's bring him in.

07:28.588 --> 07:33.592
Nice forgery. Shawn Wyle,
LLBC, criminal Law.

07:33.660 --> 07:36.829
Look, you guys got me on this already.
What do you want from me?

07:36.897 --> 07:40.265
- Information.
- I got nothing to give.

07:40.333 --> 07:42.333
You helped a prisoner escape
from a federal penitentiary.

07:42.401 --> 07:44.335
Come on!

07:44.403 --> 07:46.203
He must have given you
some kind of incentive.

07:46.271 --> 07:48.205
But all the money in the world

07:48.273 --> 07:50.575
won't do you any good
in here, will it?

07:50.643 --> 07:54.011
If you help us out, I can talk to the Crown,
maybe get you out of here before retirement age.

07:54.079 --> 07:56.080
But you have to give us
something that will help.

07:56.148 --> 07:59.817
Look, I don't know anything.

07:59.884 --> 08:01.819
- Where you headed?
- I'm going to find a nice,

08:01.886 --> 08:05.856
shady spot by a temple,
beneath a Banyan tree.

08:05.924 --> 08:07.825
We already have a rough idea

08:07.892 --> 08:10.360
of where he's headed.
Somewhere hot, tropical.

08:10.428 --> 08:12.529
All we need is a little help
narrowing it down.

08:12.597 --> 08:14.630
If you guys
want help finding Magnus,

08:14.698 --> 08:16.699
you've come to the wrong place.

08:16.767 --> 08:20.035
Banyan trees and temples.
Could be Cambodia,

08:20.103 --> 08:22.037
India, Thailand.

08:22.105 --> 08:24.106
He'd never give anyone
his actual destination.

08:24.174 --> 08:26.041
That's right. He knew
we would have got it from him.

08:26.109 --> 08:28.010
He wants us to think
he's running.

08:28.078 --> 08:30.144
But I don't think
he's going anywhere.

08:30.212 --> 08:32.212
He's got unfinished business.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.148
We just have to figure
out what it is.

08:34.216 --> 08:36.116
(phone ringing)
Yeah?

08:36.184 --> 08:38.453
Hey, Michelle:
we had a Magnus sighting.

08:42.091 --> 08:45.526
You're OK?

08:45.594 --> 08:48.028
He wanted to know the details
of Harrow's prison release.

08:48.096 --> 08:49.897
What did you tell him?

08:49.965 --> 08:52.833
That Harrow's father hired me
to file a motion of appeal.

08:52.901 --> 08:56.136
And this appeal
was based on...?

08:56.204 --> 08:58.171
Some issues with the chain
of evidence.

08:58.239 --> 09:00.173
But it was obvious
it wasn't going to be granted.

09:00.241 --> 09:02.642
Harrow cut me loose
a week later.

09:02.710 --> 09:05.512
But Gregory Harrow
was released.

09:05.579 --> 09:09.015
That wasn't my doing. (Thinking to herself): <i>It
always helps to be a rich man's son.</i>

09:09.082 --> 09:12.385
- What did he say when you told him this?
- He said

09:12.452 --> 09:14.754
that I told him everything
he needed to know.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.723
And then he gave me this.

09:16.790 --> 09:19.525
He said it's for you.

09:21.728 --> 09:25.163
"On wrongs,
swift vengeance waits."

09:25.231 --> 09:28.634
Alexander Pope:
one of his better lines.

09:28.701 --> 09:32.804
So Magnus still sees himself
as the avenging angel.

09:32.872 --> 09:35.172
I've been on with Metro.
They've been checking

09:35.240 --> 09:37.542
security cams, traffic cams,
in the area of the coffee shop.

09:37.609 --> 09:39.810
There's no Magnus
on any of them.

09:39.878 --> 09:42.146
He worked out the camera angles and only moved
when there was someone there to cover him.

09:42.213 --> 09:45.382
There are units canvassing
the area. Maybe we'll get lucky?

09:45.450 --> 09:47.652
- Don't hold your breath.
- He exposed himself

09:47.719 --> 09:49.653
to a lot of risk
to talk to the lawyer.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.555
Sounds like
he didn't get much, though.

09:51.622 --> 09:54.624
- She said that he got what he needed.
- Yeah, I got a read off her.

09:54.692 --> 09:57.293
She was thinking, "It helps
to be a rich man's son."

09:57.361 --> 10:01.598
So I guess she thinks he got out of prison
because of his dad's money or influence.

10:01.666 --> 10:03.833
Dev, can you pull up
Gregory Harrow's file?

10:03.901 --> 10:05.734
Yeah, but he's dead.
What do we care?

10:05.802 --> 10:08.070
Because Magnus cares.

10:08.137 --> 10:11.373
Copy that.

10:21.884 --> 10:25.653
Weird, the file's incomplete. It
stops when Harrow went to prison,

10:25.721 --> 10:28.089
and then the next entry
is just "he's dead".

10:28.156 --> 10:30.758
- It's been redacted.
- So what are we looking at?

10:30.826 --> 10:34.428
- Another agency who doesn't want us to look
at this file? - Doesn't mean we won't get it.

10:34.496 --> 10:37.398
Whoever put the fix in on this is
working at a pretty high level.

10:37.466 --> 10:40.968
We have to find out what happened to Gregory
Harrow in the month before his death.

10:41.035 --> 10:42.970
Give me three hours,
a bag of cheesy puffs

10:43.037 --> 10:45.839
and some grape drink. Stat.

10:45.907 --> 10:47.808
Hey. I'm going to go home,
grab a shower,

10:47.875 --> 10:49.610
change my clothes.
How are you doing?

10:49.677 --> 10:52.079
I'm fine. I'll be better once
Magnus is back behind bars.

10:52.146 --> 10:54.213
Hey, look, you got him before,
You'll get him again.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.916
He's the smartest criminal
I've ever tracked.

10:56.984 --> 10:59.585
Look, we're in this together,
OK? We'll get him.

10:59.653 --> 11:01.520
OK. I'll call you
when I have something.

11:01.588 --> 11:04.523
All right, cool.

11:12.331 --> 11:16.300
So, sir, you decided
to brush on your skills,

11:16.368 --> 11:18.903
and you chose me
as the... brush.

11:18.971 --> 11:21.405
I am sure flattered.
Tickled, really.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.908
- Honoured actually. Honoured.
- You're blathering, Mr. Bey.

11:23.976 --> 11:27.478
Well, blathering was my minor
in my college. That was a joke.

11:27.546 --> 11:30.348
They didn't really have blathering.
Well, it was an MFA course,

11:30.415 --> 11:33.317
but you had to get your bachelor
in rambling first,

11:33.385 --> 11:35.386
and then, you'd go right
to blathering.

11:35.454 --> 11:37.721
- You're still blathering.
- OK.

11:37.789 --> 11:40.525
(Woman on the radio): <i>Dispatch to 113. We
have a man in seizure, a man in seizure.</i>

11:40.592 --> 11:43.059
<i>Winston Churchill</i>
<i>at the Queensway. Over.</i>

11:43.127 --> 11:45.094
113, we're on our way.

11:45.163 --> 11:48.765
- Be there in about five minutes.
- Dundas to the 427?

11:48.832 --> 11:52.869
- No, we're going to take the Lakeshore.
- This close to rush hour?

11:52.936 --> 11:54.904
(Sighing): OK! Yeah,
we can take the Lakeshore.

11:54.972 --> 11:57.940
(siren)

12:11.321 --> 12:13.689
Hello again, Mr. Logan.

12:21.403 --> 12:25.494
You truly don't know what a pear tastes like,
until you've been denied one for years.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.393
You should have called ahead, I
would have got some organic ones.

12:28.461 --> 12:31.096
Keep emptying your pockets.

12:34.967 --> 12:37.603
Oh, I took the liberty
of disconnecting your internet

12:37.670 --> 12:40.070
and your land line. Forgive me
for being overzealous.

12:40.138 --> 12:42.573
If I don't check in soon, you
know they'll wonder where I am.

12:42.641 --> 12:45.543
I'll be a ghost by then.

12:45.611 --> 12:47.845
Back against the pillar.

12:53.552 --> 12:57.654
So, why are you here?
Why me?

12:57.722 --> 13:01.959
I considered paying a call
on Sergeant McCluskey,

13:02.026 --> 13:05.229
but I'm not ready yet.

13:05.296 --> 13:07.464
We'll have our time.

13:07.531 --> 13:09.499
OK, I see,
you're here for a reason.

13:09.567 --> 13:11.735
What is it?

13:18.709 --> 13:20.843
This is about
Gregory Harrow, isn't it?

13:20.911 --> 13:23.946
You know, I find it very,
very interesting, Mr. Logan,

13:24.014 --> 13:27.483
that you've been made a full-time special
consultant in Sergeant McCluskey's unit.

13:27.550 --> 13:30.686
It's not that unusual.

13:30.754 --> 13:33.855
The IIB employs specialists

13:33.923 --> 13:37.125
with unique
investigative expertise.

13:37.193 --> 13:39.895
And no offence,
but you're a paramedic.

13:39.962 --> 13:43.531
You're an expert in intubation,
not investigation.

13:43.599 --> 13:46.133
So...

13:46.201 --> 13:48.102
what does she see in you?
What is it

13:48.170 --> 13:50.137
that merits
her special attention?

13:50.205 --> 13:52.139
I don't think you're here
to talk about my resume.

13:52.207 --> 13:55.876
Why did you harass
the Harrow family lawyer?

13:55.944 --> 13:57.878
She had information I required.

13:57.946 --> 14:00.781
- What information?
- Don't play games.

14:00.849 --> 14:04.151
You know she said she had nothing to
do with Gregory Harrow's release.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.987
So, what does this
have to do with us?

14:07.055 --> 14:10.490
By now, sergeant McCluskey
has looked at Harrow's record.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.526
I need to know what happened
to him between the time

14:12.593 --> 14:15.196
of his release
and the time of his death.

14:15.263 --> 14:18.131
You don't expect me
to tell you.

14:18.199 --> 14:21.901
Oh, now here's where
it gets interesting.

14:21.969 --> 14:25.771
One of two things
just happened.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.740
Either you know the answer
I'm looking for

14:27.808 --> 14:31.277
and you're keeping it from me...
or you know nothing

14:31.345 --> 14:34.880
and you're trying to bluff me
into revealing my hand.

14:37.583 --> 14:40.953
So which is it, Mr. Logan?

14:42.455 --> 14:44.622
You're bluffing.

14:44.690 --> 14:46.825
You don't know.

14:46.893 --> 14:49.460
(Magnus sighs.)

14:49.527 --> 14:52.730
I imagine the files
were adjusted.

14:55.300 --> 14:57.268
What are you planning on doing?

14:57.336 --> 14:59.036
I can't do all
of your work for you.

14:59.104 --> 15:01.906
I'm sure McCluskey
is already working things out.

15:01.974 --> 15:04.307
Nipping at my heels.

15:04.375 --> 15:09.079
(Thinking to himself): <i>The sins of the son are</i>
<i>sometimes paid by the father</i>

15:09.146 --> 15:12.315
Good day, Mr. Logan.

15:21.124 --> 15:23.692
Klein, what's the status
on Magnus Elphrenson?

15:23.760 --> 15:25.527
It's nice of you
to take an interest.

15:25.595 --> 15:27.696
We have some promising leads.

15:27.764 --> 15:30.900
Word upstairs is you've been
sniffing around the wrong trees.

15:30.967 --> 15:32.902
That sounds unhealthy.

15:32.969 --> 15:35.470
What's really going on?

15:35.538 --> 15:38.472
Someone in your unit
was flagged doing a hard search

15:38.540 --> 15:41.776
- on the Gregory Harrow file.
- Flagged by whom?

15:41.843 --> 15:43.778
I don't know.

15:43.845 --> 15:47.048
All I know is that I got a call.
Feathers were ruffled.

15:47.116 --> 15:48.950
Well, give me a chance
to smooth them out.

15:49.018 --> 15:50.952
- Who do I speak to?
- You needn't worry about that.

15:51.020 --> 15:53.686
All you need to worry about
is finding Magnus.

15:53.754 --> 15:56.123
We'll find him.
Of course,

15:56.190 --> 15:59.092
it would be infinitely easier if
we had the information we needed.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.228
We need that file.

16:03.231 --> 16:06.533
Come on, Jeremy, we've been
in the trenches together.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.634
No one needs to know
where it came from.

16:14.374 --> 16:18.077
He sent you a text
to come pick me up?

16:18.145 --> 16:20.446
From your cell.
He left it outside.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.481
Oh, that was nice.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.916
I just don't understand
why he would come here.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.918
Why come after you?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.787
He came here trying to pry
information from me.

16:29.855 --> 16:33.058
He said he wasn't ready for you.
I think he's afraid.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.461
Magnus isn't scared of anything. Did
you manage to get anything from him?

16:36.528 --> 16:38.964
Yeah, I think he has a serious
beef with Harrow senior.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.465
Or he just wants us
to think that.

16:41.532 --> 16:44.734
No, I got it from a read.
He doesn't know I know.

16:44.802 --> 16:46.736
Well, however Harrow fits
into this, we have to make sure

16:46.804 --> 16:49.573
we're making the rules
of this game, not Magnus.

16:49.640 --> 16:53.444
(siren)

16:53.511 --> 16:55.745
- What are we dealing with here?
- He was seizing

16:55.813 --> 16:58.681
- when we arrived. - Administered 10mg
of diazepam. Put him on a phenytoin drip.

16:58.748 --> 17:02.151
He's stable. - His heart rate is slightly
elevated; there's a tremor

17:02.219 --> 17:04.887
in his left hand even after the
seizure passed. I'm thinking--

17:04.954 --> 17:07.357
- I was thinking it was brought
on by alcohol withdrawal.

17:07.424 --> 17:10.359
- What he said.
- Makes sense. I'll run some blood tests to confirm.

17:12.661 --> 17:14.628
You're really enjoying
this, aren't you, sir?

17:14.696 --> 17:16.798
Yeah. You know what?
Let's take lunch on the road,

17:16.866 --> 17:18.800
you know, see if we can get
in another call.

17:18.867 --> 17:20.801
- Hey Oz.
- Oh, Spike!

17:20.869 --> 17:23.472
- Look at this guy!
- How are you, man?

17:23.539 --> 17:25.040
- Got the big stun gun in there.
- Yeah. Don't touch the tazer.

17:25.108 --> 17:27.976
- What's going on with this?
- Ah. I got shrapnel

17:28.042 --> 17:30.911
from a door charge, you know.
Just got a couple of stitches.

17:30.979 --> 17:33.247
No biggie. Not like that time
at the junction, remember that?

17:33.315 --> 17:35.816
The guy with all that C4?
All of it goes off at once.

17:35.884 --> 17:38.219
- Takes out half a building.
- Wow.

17:38.286 --> 17:40.054
- It was a terrifying day.
- This guy, he kept

17:40.122 --> 17:42.323
his cool the whole time.

17:42.391 --> 17:45.691
No, I'm serious, man. You're one of those guys, you know.
You had our back the whole time.

17:45.759 --> 17:48.594
- Right back at you, slick.
- All right. Be good!

17:48.662 --> 17:51.297
Careful! Don't get
that thing wet!

17:51.365 --> 17:55.235
Nice uniform. Those SRU boys
wear them well, don't they?

17:55.302 --> 17:58.138
Mmm, something about a man
in Kevlar. Ooh!

17:58.205 --> 18:00.105
Please. Black and grey?

18:00.173 --> 18:02.674
- Yawn. Let's go.
- Oh, now he wants to go.

18:09.215 --> 18:12.617
Mr. Harrow's
been waiting for you.

18:16.555 --> 18:18.756
Come in, sit down, please.
Can I get you a drink?

18:18.823 --> 18:20.658
No, thank you.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.294
Well, thank you very much
for coming by,

18:23.362 --> 18:27.331
but I have already been made aware
of Mr. Elphrenson's escape.

18:27.399 --> 18:29.767
Do you have any idea
why he would be after you?

18:29.834 --> 18:33.103
After me? No reason.

18:33.171 --> 18:37.040
He had a problem with my son...
my son is dead.

18:37.108 --> 18:40.310
Well, we think he still might be
interested in you for some reason.

18:40.378 --> 18:42.912
I can't imagine why.
He's already taken

18:42.980 --> 18:45.014
everything I care about.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.817
Somehow, he managed
to contact us from prison:

18:47.885 --> 18:50.486
emails, phone calls, threats.

18:50.554 --> 18:54.190
Threats seeking justice
for his daughter.

18:54.257 --> 18:57.993
My wife finally found it
intolerable, and she left me.

18:58.061 --> 19:00.028
As for my son...

19:00.097 --> 19:02.198
I refused to speak to him
after he got out of prison.

19:02.265 --> 19:06.334
The things that he did
to that girl were...

19:06.402 --> 19:10.271
I should have you locked up
and throw away the key!

19:10.339 --> 19:14.041
Still... he was my son.

19:14.110 --> 19:16.511
Magnus believes there was
some kind of injustice done,

19:16.579 --> 19:18.513
due to your son's
early release.

19:18.581 --> 19:20.481
I'm afraid I don't understand

19:20.548 --> 19:22.949
- what you're talking about.
- He believes that you might

19:23.017 --> 19:25.219
have pulled some strings
to get Gregory out of jail.

19:25.286 --> 19:27.521
I don't care what he thinks.

19:27.589 --> 19:30.857
I see no reason for all
of this to be dredged up again.

19:30.925 --> 19:33.594
We're asking these questions
because Magnus is asking them.

19:33.661 --> 19:35.629
We're just trying to figure out
what it is he wants exactly.

19:35.696 --> 19:38.831
Well, unfortunately,
you've come to the wrong place.

19:38.898 --> 19:42.535
So, I have a meeting
in just a few minutes.

19:42.603 --> 19:45.104
- If you don't mind...
- Thank you for your time.

19:45.172 --> 19:47.173
Not at all,
always happy to be of help.

20:07.860 --> 20:10.661
Dev, any luck finding
the Harrow file?

20:10.728 --> 20:14.331
No, sorry. I feel like I've knocked
on every door I can. I just...

20:14.399 --> 20:17.668
Next time, come to the master.

20:17.735 --> 20:20.871
The master, eh?

20:20.938 --> 20:23.340
Wait a second,
this is exactly what we need.

20:23.408 --> 20:27.143
How'd you get your hands
on it? Forget I asked.

20:27.211 --> 20:29.245
Thank you.

20:32.616 --> 20:34.617
Two weeks after the motion
was filed by Robin Wise,

20:34.685 --> 20:37.953
another motion for appeal
was filed. No more compelling,

20:38.021 --> 20:40.355
but the judge granted it.
His stamp's here.

20:40.423 --> 20:42.391
Yeah, but there's
another stamp right next to it

20:42.458 --> 20:45.527
from another office. Code CF10.

20:45.595 --> 20:48.096
- What is that? Military?
- Or Intelligence.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.998
- OK, before we get
all conspiracy theory:

20:50.066 --> 20:52.801
The prison release
was signed off by a dune named

20:52.868 --> 20:54.969
Michael Thorpe,
from Correctional Services.

20:55.037 --> 20:57.806
What do we have on him?

21:02.644 --> 21:04.611
Mr. Thorpe is retired.

21:04.679 --> 21:08.115
He left public service
in September, 2010.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.150
Wait, this isn't right,
then. Look, he signed this

21:10.218 --> 21:12.152
January, 2011.

21:12.220 --> 21:14.922
Actually,
look at these signatures:

21:14.989 --> 21:17.424
the death certificate,
the prison release.

21:17.491 --> 21:20.459
[Michelle]: Different name,
same signature style.

21:20.527 --> 21:22.862
[Dev]: Yeah, you're right.
The handwriting's identical.

21:22.930 --> 21:24.931
These are all forgeries.

21:24.998 --> 21:26.966
Including the death
certificate.

21:27.034 --> 21:30.669
Michelle? Metro's on the line. There's
been a break-in at the Harrow house.

21:35.041 --> 21:36.708
[Man]: Mr. Harrow was gone
for the day.

21:36.776 --> 21:38.744
I stepped out for supplies.

21:38.811 --> 21:40.712
When I got back,
the back door was open.

21:40.780 --> 21:42.748
- What about your alarm system?
- Disabled.

21:42.815 --> 21:45.150
Security monitor too.
They don't know how.

21:45.218 --> 21:47.585
- Magnus.
- Is Mr. Harrow here?

21:47.653 --> 21:50.688
In the study.

21:52.924 --> 21:55.292
Thanks.

21:59.631 --> 22:03.134
Ah! Sergeant McCluskey, I'm sorry
you had to come all this way.

22:03.201 --> 22:05.836
- There's no need, really.
- We understand you had a break-in.

22:05.904 --> 22:08.271
Well. Terrence found
the door open

22:08.338 --> 22:10.306
and he overreacted.

22:10.374 --> 22:12.075
Well, your security system
was disabled, and your cameras

22:12.143 --> 22:14.244
were blacked out.
I wouldn't say he overreacted.

22:14.311 --> 22:17.613
Yes, well... The point
is that nothing was disturbed

22:17.681 --> 22:19.749
and whoever did this
went away empty-handed.

22:21.886 --> 22:24.086
Bastard!

22:30.026 --> 22:34.263
What? Where are you going?

22:34.330 --> 22:35.898
Is this your son's urn?

22:35.965 --> 22:38.333
Yes. Is there a problem?

22:51.847 --> 22:53.815
I think I know why Magnus came.

22:53.882 --> 22:55.816
- Why?
- I think he took a sample

22:55.883 --> 22:57.884
of Gregory's ashes.

23:00.888 --> 23:04.825
He doesn't think
Gregory Harrow is dead.

23:04.892 --> 23:06.927
Neither do I.

23:11.693 --> 23:13.918
DNA results are in.

23:14.412 --> 23:17.247
We know the individual
was young and healthy...

23:17.314 --> 23:20.283
and apparently four-legged.
It was a pig.

23:20.351 --> 23:21.984
- Come on!
- Yeah.

23:22.052 --> 23:24.353
So if we know this,
Magnus knows this.

23:24.421 --> 23:27.122
Results are in,
Gregory Harrow is alive.

23:27.190 --> 23:29.158
I know.

23:29.225 --> 23:31.126
You can't,
the results just came in.

23:31.194 --> 23:33.895
I found out another way.
Conference room. Everyone.

23:35.865 --> 23:39.934
Team, this is
Sergeant White, CSIS.

23:40.001 --> 23:42.803
I'm here to talk
about your case.

23:42.871 --> 23:45.406
If you don't mind my asking,
why is this on your radar?

23:45.474 --> 23:48.443
Gregory Harrow is in the highest
level of witness protection.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.578
- OK, I'm sorry.
Let me get this right:

23:50.645 --> 23:53.414
you sprung Harrow from jail,
forged documents,

23:53.482 --> 23:56.116
faked his death
and put pig ashes in the urn?

23:56.184 --> 23:59.119
- Harrow was a valuable asset.
- What did he do

23:59.187 --> 24:01.455
- for you exactly?
- That's a state secret.

24:01.522 --> 24:04.424
We're asking you to work with us, Sergeant.
Harrow's life is at stake.

24:04.492 --> 24:07.727
All of this is above
my pay grade.

24:07.795 --> 24:10.329
From what I understand,
Harrow shared a prison cell

24:10.397 --> 24:12.698
with a certain individual,
a person of interest.

24:12.765 --> 24:15.501
This person of interest,
he was a... What was he? A spy?

24:15.569 --> 24:18.537
All I know is that Harrow
put his life on the line

24:18.605 --> 24:20.539
in order to assist us
in bringing this individual

24:20.607 --> 24:22.608
to justice. And in return
for that favour,

24:22.675 --> 24:24.643
we offered certain...

24:24.711 --> 24:27.412
concessions regarding
his sentence.

24:27.480 --> 24:30.615
[Michelle]: What could he have to
do with intelligence operations?

24:30.682 --> 24:34.986
[Man]: <i>I don't care what you tell them,
just shut them down! This ends now!</i>

24:35.053 --> 24:37.455
You're not telling us
the truth, are you?

24:37.523 --> 24:40.958
Someone's scared. And she's
just here to shut us down.

24:42.793 --> 24:46.630
- Your investigation into this Harrow matter goes no further.
- He needs to be warned.

24:46.697 --> 24:48.865
CSIS has the situation
under control.

24:48.933 --> 24:51.835
You don't know
Magnus. He will kill him.

24:51.902 --> 24:54.371
Best of luck with your case.

25:00.810 --> 25:03.312
Sometimes a convict
gets lucky and he shares a cell

25:03.380 --> 25:05.648
with someone of interest:
a spy, a gangster,

25:05.715 --> 25:08.083
a terror suspect.
If he's smart, he gathers intel

25:08.152 --> 25:09.918
and turns into
something of value.

25:09.986 --> 25:12.421
Gregory Harrow is not the
sharpest knife in the drawer.

25:12.489 --> 25:14.389
Even if he did have
amazing intel, he wouldn't know

25:14.457 --> 25:17.091
- what to do with it.
- What are you implying?

25:17.160 --> 25:19.361
- This is a cover-up.
- She was scared.

25:19.428 --> 25:21.429
I saw a guy telling her
to shut us down.

25:21.497 --> 25:23.698
Who's her commanding officer?

25:23.766 --> 25:25.933
Colonel Ranna. He's
top-flight intelligence agent.

25:26.001 --> 25:28.170
I find it difficult to believe
he's been compromised.

25:28.237 --> 25:31.539
Charles Harrow has endless
finances and serious clout.

25:31.606 --> 25:33.541
He could have gotten to Ranna.

25:33.608 --> 25:35.476
We're reaching here, guys.

25:35.544 --> 25:37.645
Shouldn't we be focused
on capturing Magnus?

25:37.712 --> 25:40.614
- We've got every available unit scouring the city.
- Let's bring in Charles Harrow.

25:40.682 --> 25:43.484
Alright, right now,
all you have are allegations.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.988
Find some proof before you turn my
life into a political nightmare.

25:54.161 --> 25:56.896
Hey!

25:56.963 --> 25:58.898
Thanks.

25:58.965 --> 26:01.201
I've been going through
Charles Harrow's books.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.502
It's a bit like
falling down the rabbit hole,

26:03.570 --> 26:05.671
but I think I've found where
the body might be buried.

26:05.738 --> 26:07.772
Harrow made significant
contributions

26:07.840 --> 26:10.275
to a number
of philanthropic organizations.

26:10.343 --> 26:12.877
- How significant?
- Six zeroes significant.

26:12.945 --> 26:15.514
A rich man giving
to charity isn't strange.

26:15.582 --> 26:17.616
Yeah, except...

26:17.684 --> 26:19.817
that one charity in particular,
I noticed a big spike

26:19.884 --> 26:22.886
in donations right around the time that
Gregory went into witness protection.

26:22.954 --> 26:25.690
I'm bringing him in.

26:25.757 --> 26:28.826
<i>Actually, my son</i>

26:28.893 --> 26:31.629
assisted in bringing down
a Russian spy

26:31.697 --> 26:33.997
that he met in prison.

26:34.065 --> 26:36.766
He was placed
in Witness Protection

26:36.834 --> 26:39.969
for his own safety. They won't
even tell me where he is.

26:40.037 --> 26:42.839
Why didn't you
tell us this before?

26:42.906 --> 26:46.710
Well, I was sworn to secrecy.

26:46.777 --> 26:49.779
You said you were estranged from your son.
Was it also a lie?

26:49.847 --> 26:52.047
No.

26:52.115 --> 26:55.417
When Gregory was arrested for
what he did to that poor girl...

26:55.485 --> 26:58.186
I have to tell you,
my family's life was ruined.

26:58.255 --> 27:01.357
And by everyone thinking that he was
dead and buried, you could wipe

27:01.424 --> 27:03.626
his slate clean.
You could start over.

27:03.693 --> 27:06.295
- Colonel, I'm asking
man to man:

27:06.363 --> 27:11.199
<i>please, help me.</i>
<i>I don't blame you, Charles.</i>

27:11.267 --> 27:13.601
- Blame me for what?
- For buying your kid's way

27:13.669 --> 27:16.771
into Witness Protection.
Getting him a new life.

27:16.838 --> 27:20.174
He's your son:
who could blame you?

27:25.113 --> 27:26.947
- How did it go in there?
- I got him talking

27:27.015 --> 27:28.949
to a Colonel.
Must be Colonel Ranna.

27:29.017 --> 27:31.217
Maybe he's not as clean
as his rep would suggest.

27:31.286 --> 27:34.053
"At every word
a reputation dies."

27:34.121 --> 27:37.223
Alexander Pope said that too.

27:37.292 --> 27:40.026
You know how you're always telling me to
follow the money? So I followed the money,

27:40.094 --> 27:42.162
and you know, the charity that
Harold contributed millions too?

27:42.229 --> 27:44.964
They immediately contracted
a private security firm,

27:45.032 --> 27:48.167
here in Canada-- - OK. Can we prove that
Ranna took money from Harrow?

27:48.234 --> 27:51.970
Yes. Forensic accounting
will get you every time.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.706
Ranna's an advisor
to the company.

28:04.583 --> 28:07.752
- Oh, man.
- Hm!

28:07.820 --> 28:09.887
- Oh, man!
- Didn't I tell you?

28:09.955 --> 28:12.757
Who would have thought a laundromat
would have the best coffee in Toronto?

28:12.825 --> 28:15.860
I used to go there twice a day
when I was on the road.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.396
Any emergency call
in the area, I would take it,

28:18.464 --> 28:20.397
just for this, even if I was
halfway across the city.

28:20.465 --> 28:24.802
- Hey, to good coffee.
- And good company.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.871
So what are you really
doing out here, sir?

28:26.939 --> 28:29.240
- I told you.
- Right, the "sharpening

28:29.308 --> 28:31.242
of the skills". I don't buy
that for a second, sir.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.277
What is this?
Some sort of supervisor test?

28:33.345 --> 28:35.778
Like a secret shopper screening
kind of a thing?

28:35.847 --> 28:38.681
It's nothing like that.
I miss it.

28:38.749 --> 28:41.084
The road, the adrenaline,

28:41.152 --> 28:43.320
the camaraderie, it's just...

28:43.387 --> 28:45.788
- The coffee?
- Yes, the coffee.

28:45.857 --> 28:48.391
So I figured, you know,
I'd give myself a little reward,

28:48.459 --> 28:51.526
go back in time a few years,
see if the road is as much fun

28:51.594 --> 28:54.196
- as I remember it being.
- And is it?

28:54.264 --> 28:56.932
Yeah. Hell, yeah.
(laughing)

28:59.602 --> 29:02.671
Colonel Ranna?
Sergeant McCluskey, IIB.

29:02.739 --> 29:04.740
McCluskey, I've heard
good things.

29:04.807 --> 29:06.842
- They say you're one to watch.
- Thank you, sir.

29:06.909 --> 29:09.710
Look, we don't want to waste your time, we're
here to talk to you about Gregory Harrow

29:09.778 --> 29:14.115
It was reported to me that
you had stumbled onto this.

29:14.183 --> 29:17.785
I'm sure you both know
this is highly confidential.

29:17.853 --> 29:21.055
And if there's nothing more,
I do have a committee meeting.

29:21.123 --> 29:24.291
We know that Harrow paid you.

29:24.359 --> 29:26.393
How did it feel to give
a new life to a rapist

29:26.460 --> 29:28.395
and murderer?

29:28.462 --> 29:30.364
I was doing my job.

29:30.431 --> 29:32.366
Harrow had vital intel that led

29:32.433 --> 29:34.567
to the arrest
of a person of interest.

29:34.635 --> 29:37.604
- [Michelle]: We have no evidence of that.
<i>- I've covered the bases,</i>

29:37.671 --> 29:39.773
<i>the Russian is already</i>
<i>out of the country...</i>

29:39.840 --> 29:42.442
You come down here
and question me on matters

29:42.510 --> 29:44.377
of national security?
I would have

29:44.445 --> 29:47.947
expected more from someone
with your reputation.

29:48.015 --> 29:50.082
Forensic accounting
will get you every time.

29:50.150 --> 29:53.486
Intelligence Officer's actions
are protected

29:53.554 --> 29:56.955
by the Security
of Information Act. I suggest

29:57.023 --> 29:59.991
- you read it sometime.
- The Act doesn't cover

30:00.059 --> 30:02.795
personal accounts.
I have actually read it, sir.

30:02.862 --> 30:07.098
Look, you know
how this is going to go down.

30:07.166 --> 30:09.167
(sighing)
What do you want?

30:09.235 --> 30:11.537
Well, the truth
would be a good start.

30:16.142 --> 30:19.044
Charles was sent to me
by a mutual friend.

30:19.111 --> 30:21.379
He said that his son
wasn't safe,

30:21.447 --> 30:23.548
that Elphrenson was planning
on killing him.

30:23.615 --> 30:27.018
He asked for my help. I had use
for him, and he helped.

30:27.086 --> 30:30.054
- For a price.
- This was an official action.

30:30.121 --> 30:33.157
Once I gave him his new identity,
I washed my hands of all of it.

30:33.224 --> 30:35.259
Alright, can you
tell us where he is?

30:35.327 --> 30:37.261
Your cooperation
will be on record.

30:37.329 --> 30:39.863
If you're gonna go
any farther with this,

30:39.931 --> 30:42.199
you're gonna have to use
that proof of yours.

30:42.267 --> 30:45.068
But if I were you,
I would think carefully

30:45.135 --> 30:47.036
before taking this
to the next level.

30:47.104 --> 30:49.372
We don't have much time.

30:49.440 --> 30:51.407
Gregory Harrow is going to die.

30:51.475 --> 30:54.510
It's sensitive intel
protected on a secret server.

30:54.578 --> 30:56.846
Yes, we found the servers.

30:56.913 --> 31:00.082
<i>- How do they know about Wipserv?
- We know about Wipserv.</i>

31:00.149 --> 31:03.085
You can help us.
You know how to get in.

31:03.152 --> 31:05.887
This information will not
be made available to you.

31:05.955 --> 31:09.624
You've made a mistake.
You can make it right.

31:09.692 --> 31:13.195
Just think about it,
tell us what the password is.

31:13.262 --> 31:15.997
<i>Invictus.</i>

31:16.064 --> 31:19.000
If you want any more. You'll
have to go through the D.N.D.

31:21.536 --> 31:24.038
- We're OK.
- Hm-hmm.

31:24.106 --> 31:26.707
So he said Gregory's new identity is
on a secure server. Can you get us in?

31:26.774 --> 31:29.410
Well, servers are a lot like
an endless series of doors.

31:29.478 --> 31:31.845
- I need to know which one.
- Try Wipserv.

31:31.913 --> 31:34.147
Wipserv.

31:34.215 --> 31:36.182
Alright, you're one for two.

31:36.250 --> 31:39.052
- You got a login?
- Try invictus.

31:43.857 --> 31:46.059
[Dev]: Well, yes.
You're batting a thousand

31:46.127 --> 31:48.060
- today, buddy.
- I've got my moments.

31:55.135 --> 31:58.470
There he is.
Right there. Wow.

31:58.538 --> 32:01.606
[Dev]: OK,
Gregory Harrow is now

32:01.674 --> 32:04.375
Jeremy Metzger.
He's living in Vancouver.

32:04.443 --> 32:07.745
This is the information that Magnus wants more
than anything. We need to keep this tight.

32:07.812 --> 32:10.781
(cell phone ringing)

32:10.849 --> 32:13.684
- Yeah.
- [Hello, Michelle.]

32:13.752 --> 32:16.421
- Magnus.
- What?

32:16.488 --> 32:19.223
- Keep him on the line.
- I just wanted to thank you and your team.

32:19.291 --> 32:21.324
- For what exactly?
- [You want to keep me talking]

32:21.392 --> 32:24.061
[to give your associate a chance
to run a tree. He can]

32:24.128 --> 32:26.763
take all the time he wants,
he's not going to find me.

32:26.830 --> 32:29.332
He's using a VOIP
and a spoofer.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.668
- What does that mean?
- It's complicated.

32:31.735 --> 32:33.903
- It means he's good.
- I set the table for you,

32:33.971 --> 32:35.905
and you've served it up
just the way I needed it.

32:35.973 --> 32:38.107
Magnus, you don't have to kill
Gregory Harrow.

32:38.175 --> 32:40.676
- He does need to die.
- OK, I almost got him.

32:40.743 --> 32:43.645
I've caught you twice before, Magnus. You
know what they say? Third time's the charm.

32:43.713 --> 32:46.915
It was nice to hear
your voice, Michelle.

32:46.983 --> 32:49.218
We'll talk again soon.

32:49.286 --> 32:52.320
Ah... he's gone.

32:52.388 --> 32:55.090
- Is that enough?
- He's here!

32:55.157 --> 32:58.059
He's here. He's in the building.
He's in the server room.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.029
Security, we have a breach. We
need to lock the building down

33:02.098 --> 33:04.165
immediately. Lock it down.
Full sweep.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.501
[Michelle]: Dev,
stay in contact.

33:06.569 --> 33:08.835
Michelle, wait. He's
in the elevator. He's jacking

33:08.903 --> 33:13.173
- in the security system.
- [Klein]: Everyone, we have a security breach.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.375
How did he get my cameras?

33:15.443 --> 33:17.644
I'll bring him to you,
I got control of the elevators!

33:17.712 --> 33:21.348
(alarm ringing continuously)

33:25.952 --> 33:29.088
[Toby]: Alright,
he's almost here.

33:38.332 --> 33:40.398
He's gone.

33:47.902 --> 33:50.137
- How did he do this?
- Well, we're talking

33:50.205 --> 33:52.139
about a man who escaped
maximum security

33:52.207 --> 33:53.772
not once, but four times.

33:54.078 --> 33:56.946
Security has been over the entire
building, nothing. He just vanished.

33:57.013 --> 33:59.715
- Wow.
- I was just in the server room.

33:59.783 --> 34:01.984
It looks like Magnus
was camped out down there.

34:02.051 --> 34:04.786
He punched a hole
in my firewall.

34:04.854 --> 34:07.856
He's been watching my computer. It's safe
to say that he knows everything that we do.

34:07.923 --> 34:09.824
So, he's got the new name
and address.

34:09.891 --> 34:12.793
Well, he played us all the way.

34:12.862 --> 34:14.896
Let's contact the IIB field
office in Vancouver.

34:14.964 --> 34:16.931
See if they can find
this Jeremy Metzger.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
- Alright, then what?
- We put him in a safe house

34:19.067 --> 34:21.101
and wait for Magnus.

34:21.168 --> 34:25.438
(woman speaking hysterically
in German)

34:25.507 --> 34:29.043
Wow, that's a lot of German. Ma'am,
I need you to calm down. Can you

34:29.110 --> 34:31.879
breathe for me, please?
There you go.

34:31.946 --> 34:33.547
He's in anaphylactic shock.
I'll give him a shot

34:33.614 --> 34:35.614
of epinephrine, and then
we'll get him to Emerg--

34:35.681 --> 34:37.183
No, he's already had an epi-pen. 
It's not doing enough to

34:37.251 --> 34:39.918
bring down the tongue swelling.
It's blocking his airway.

34:39.987 --> 34:43.123
He's getting air. The epinephrine
will continue to give him relief.

34:43.190 --> 34:46.426
The best thing we can do right now
is just to get him to St-Luke's.

34:46.494 --> 34:49.862
It's getting worse, sir, we have to give
him the intercardial injection. Sir?

34:49.929 --> 34:52.898
Sir, it's not a discussion,
the ICI kit, please.

34:55.701 --> 34:57.903
Ma'am, I know this looks bad,
and you can't understand me,

34:57.970 --> 34:59.571
but it's gonna be fine. We're
gonna get him to the hospital,

34:59.639 --> 35:01.840
OK? Just need you
to calm down, we got this.

35:01.908 --> 35:04.410
(woman speaking in German)
OK, here we go,

35:04.477 --> 35:06.344
here we go.

35:06.412 --> 35:08.413
(cell phone ringing)

35:08.480 --> 35:10.515
- [Vancouver credit bureau.]
- Yes, hello there.

35:10.582 --> 35:13.551
This is Andrew Preston,
I'm with CPB Collections.

35:13.618 --> 35:15.986
I'm trying to contact
a Mr. Jeremy Metzger

35:16.055 --> 35:18.089
regarding a delinquent account.

35:18.157 --> 35:20.091
Last known address
is 2166 Robson.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.260
Do you think you'd be able
to help me with that, please?

35:22.327 --> 35:25.663
Woman: [Certainly,
just give me a moment.]

35:25.730 --> 35:28.331
[Jeremy Metzger
is no longer at that address.]

35:28.399 --> 35:31.334
[His accounts have been paid
in full and are now closed.]

35:31.402 --> 35:34.004
Oh, dear, I see.

35:34.072 --> 35:37.041
You wouldn't happen to have a forwarding
address? - [No, but there's a note.]

35:37.108 --> 35:39.976
[Inquiries into Metzger's
accounts should be directed]

35:40.044 --> 35:42.378
[to the firm of Mintz and Mint
in Toronto.]

35:42.446 --> 35:46.348
- [You need their phone number?]
- No, I have it, thank you.

35:59.829 --> 36:01.797
McCluskey?

36:01.864 --> 36:03.932
I'm here at Metzger's address,
but Metzger isn't.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.368
The place has been cleaned up
for a long time.

36:06.436 --> 36:10.306
OK, thanks for the update.

36:14.410 --> 36:16.978
So, I spoke
with "Jeremy's" landlady.

36:17.045 --> 36:19.914
Turns out he moved out of the
apartment two and a half months ago.

36:19.982 --> 36:22.817
Two months ago, he was charged
with sexual assault in West Van.

36:22.884 --> 36:24.919
Come on... he did it again?

36:24.987 --> 36:27.254
Charges were dropped
for lack of evidence.

36:27.322 --> 36:29.256
Alright, so where did he go?

36:29.324 --> 36:31.925
Wait, I got a read off Charles.

36:31.993 --> 36:33.960
He said, "I should lock you up
and throw away the key."

36:34.028 --> 36:36.663
Maybe that was after the sexual
assaults in Vancouver.

36:36.731 --> 36:37.931
He brought him home.

36:37.999 --> 36:40.467
(phone ringing)

36:40.535 --> 36:44.303
- Man: [Harrow residence.]
- Sergeant McCluskey from IIB. I need to speak to Charles Harrow.

36:44.371 --> 36:48.073
Mr. Harrow isn't here. He's up at the cottage.
I just told your colleague the same thing.

36:48.142 --> 36:50.776
- My colleague?
- [Special Consultant Logan.]

36:50.844 --> 36:53.513
- [He called here a minute ago.]
- Number of the cottage?

36:53.580 --> 36:55.615
There's no phone service,
not even cellular.

36:55.682 --> 36:57.716
Well, then I need the address.

37:00.253 --> 37:02.554
- Thank you. Dev--
- Yeah, I got it.

37:02.622 --> 37:05.524
- Toby, come on.
- I'll send backup your way.

37:32.015 --> 37:35.518
Just once, can you bring me something that
doesn't come from a drive-thru window?

37:35.586 --> 37:38.054
Be grateful for what you get.

37:38.121 --> 37:40.056
[Michelle]: Is this
the right road?

37:40.123 --> 37:42.392
I don't know, it's not
on the GPS. But I think it is.

37:42.459 --> 37:45.061
I don't get this guy. I mean,
I get protecting your son,

37:45.128 --> 37:47.263
- but the kid's a monster.
- Maybe it's love or guilt.

37:47.331 --> 37:49.732
Whatever it is,
he's just as guilty

37:49.800 --> 37:51.834
as his son, allowing him
to hurt women again.

37:51.902 --> 37:53.969
Let's just hope
he's still alive.

37:56.272 --> 37:58.507
(door slamming)
Oh, don't run out now...

37:58.575 --> 38:02.144
especially when I went
to so much trouble to find you.

38:05.514 --> 38:11.114
We have some unfinished business, Gregory,
that I am very anxious to put to rest.

38:15.033 --> 38:16.900
Here.

38:16.968 --> 38:19.236
How did you find us?

38:19.303 --> 38:21.238
Gregory has mild epilepsy.

38:21.305 --> 38:23.841
You picked up a prescription
for Dilantin.

38:23.908 --> 38:26.009
How the hell did you know that?

38:26.077 --> 38:28.946
First rule of war:
know your enemy. And I know

38:29.013 --> 38:31.447
all about what you've done.
On your knees.

38:34.184 --> 38:36.919
And you...

38:36.987 --> 38:40.389
sending the wayward son
to Vancouver...

38:40.457 --> 38:42.424
with a new name...

38:42.492 --> 38:45.494
and a hope, hm, that this time,

38:45.562 --> 38:48.029
he'd stay out of trouble.

38:50.266 --> 38:52.300
But you just couldn't help
yourself, could you, Gregory?

38:52.368 --> 38:54.402
I didn't do anything
to that girl.

38:54.470 --> 38:57.906
That's just what you said
at the trial about Andrea.

38:57.974 --> 39:01.542
- My daughter.
- Like you're father of the year or something.

39:01.610 --> 39:04.078
- Gregory, shut up!
- What difference does it make,

39:04.146 --> 39:07.948
- Dad? He's going to kill me.
- I know what he did to your daughter...

39:08.016 --> 39:11.852
I'm sorry, but it
can't be changed now. Please...

39:11.920 --> 39:15.022
I'm begging you
father to father.

39:15.090 --> 39:18.225
Please don't kill my boy.

39:18.293 --> 39:22.195
- Dev, where's our backup?
- They said they would be there within 10 minutes.

39:22.263 --> 39:24.498
Well, we don't have time,
we're going in.

39:26.734 --> 39:28.669
You know, in all my crimes...

39:28.736 --> 39:30.704
I have never spilled blood

39:30.772 --> 39:33.473
and I don't wish to,
but tonight

39:33.541 --> 39:36.976
justice is the master.

39:37.044 --> 39:41.147
And I will be its servant.

39:41.215 --> 39:44.083
Welcome, Michelle!

39:44.151 --> 39:46.352
Now we can begin.

39:46.420 --> 39:48.321
Ah!

39:48.388 --> 39:51.323
- Drop the gun, Gregory.
- Don't listen to her, Gregory,

39:51.390 --> 39:54.226
- she's the one who put you in prison.
- Think about what you're doing.

39:54.294 --> 39:56.829
- You back off!
- Don't do this, son.

39:56.896 --> 39:59.731
- Just shut up!
- Put the gun down, and we can talk about this.

39:59.799 --> 40:01.733
There's nothing
to talk about, Gregory.

40:01.801 --> 40:03.969
The power is in your hands.
Are you a man or not?

40:04.037 --> 40:06.138
He's done something.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.508
Don't do it, Greg!

40:11.576 --> 40:13.577
[Charles]: Gregory, no!
What happened? Is he OK?

40:13.645 --> 40:15.880
The gun backfired.

40:15.948 --> 40:18.749
[Charles]: Quickly.

40:18.817 --> 40:21.185
(Charles weeping softly)

40:21.253 --> 40:23.686
He's gone.

40:23.754 --> 40:27.357
No! No!
(Charles sobbing)

40:27.424 --> 40:30.526
I'm sorry, Charles.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.762
I know your pain.

40:44.874 --> 40:47.041
- So?
- Turns out the dose

40:47.109 --> 40:49.344
from the epi-pen
wasn't strong enough.

40:49.412 --> 40:52.313
So your emergency ICI
saved his life.

40:52.382 --> 40:55.116
I didn't say that. Your idea
could have worked, too.

40:55.184 --> 40:57.386
I just had to make the call.

40:57.453 --> 41:00.088
Yeah, it was a good one.
The type of call

41:00.155 --> 41:02.122
I'd like to think
I used to make back in the day.

41:02.190 --> 41:05.025
You know,
I was thinking about that.

41:05.093 --> 41:07.828
- I know you said you missed being on the road,
right? - I miss it once in a while,

41:07.896 --> 41:10.364
but I love my job
and I'm damn good at it.

41:10.432 --> 41:12.800
You see, I think I'm good
at this job, and I should stick

41:12.868 --> 41:15.335
to it. Maybe this supervisor
thing is not for me.

41:15.404 --> 41:17.370
Are you kidding me?
The way you took control,

41:17.438 --> 41:19.439
the way you put me in my place?

41:19.507 --> 41:21.674
That is supervisor behaviour.

41:21.742 --> 41:24.611
Are you sure? You seemed
pretty mad when I did that.

41:24.678 --> 41:26.646
Wait...

41:26.714 --> 41:30.082
Look, being a supervisor's
not a job description.

41:30.150 --> 41:32.084
It's an attitude,
and you got it.

41:32.152 --> 41:34.252
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.622
Got that...
street smart

41:36.689 --> 41:39.024
kind of swag? Right? That's
a thing. People say that, right?

41:39.091 --> 41:41.627
- Swag?
- Yeah, you shouldn't say that.

41:41.694 --> 41:43.629
Do you know a place
where I can find the best

41:43.696 --> 41:46.031
breakfast burrito in the city
'cause I am starving.

41:46.098 --> 41:49.366
Look, I know this place where they
make their own spicy salsa...

41:49.435 --> 41:51.936
burn your face right off.
Oof! Lead the way, sir.

41:52.003 --> 41:54.405
Alright.

41:59.244 --> 42:01.779
So he got what he wanted,

42:01.847 --> 42:03.781
Gregory Harrow is dead.

42:03.849 --> 42:05.782
And he didn't even pull
the trigger.

42:05.850 --> 42:07.951
- He got Gregory to do it for him.
- He looks pretty happy

42:08.018 --> 42:10.487
for a guy going back to prison.

42:10.555 --> 42:13.022
Maybe, he's planning
his next escape.

42:15.960 --> 42:18.294
