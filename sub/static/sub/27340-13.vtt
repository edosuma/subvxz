00:01.168 --> 00:02.468
NARRATOR: Previously
on "Ex on the Beach."

00:02.570 --> 00:04.837
A bunch of reality stars are
looking for love in Malibu

00:04.939 --> 00:08.273
while living with their exes.
And they don't know it yet,

00:08.376 --> 00:10.609
but they're about to take
a lie detector test

00:10.711 --> 00:14.113
to see if they're over their ex
or if they're full of [bleep].

00:16.384 --> 00:19.251
Nicole and Chad couldn't make
it through their ex arrivals,

00:19.353 --> 00:21.720
and Nicole was sent home
for getting physical.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.922
- [bleep] I'm shaking.

00:24.025 --> 00:27.192
- NARRATOR: Maya and Malcolm are
solid even though her ex, Perez,

00:27.294 --> 00:28.660
is still in the house.

00:28.763 --> 00:31.930
- I'm just saying I came in
with cocoa butter, is all it is.

00:32.033 --> 00:35.000
- NARRATOR: Poor Angela said
goodbye to her new love, Nelson,

00:35.102 --> 00:38.070
just in time for
her old love, Tor'i.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.471
- Yeah, you stole my
[bleep] money, bitch.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.507
- TOR'I: But you came
and laid up with him.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.642
- Yeah, I did, and
I'd do it again!

00:43.744 --> 00:44.676
I would do it again!

00:44.779 --> 00:46.912
I would cheat on you
10 more times, bitch,

00:47.014 --> 00:48.814
'cause you're a
[bleep] bum, bitch!

00:48.916 --> 00:52.451
- NARRATOR: And tonight,
it's our penultimate episode.

00:52.553 --> 00:53.419
Look it up.

00:53.521 --> 00:56.021
Chad channels his inner landlord

00:56.123 --> 00:58.290
while Maddie claims
squatter's rights.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.859
- I mean, I'll just be a
bitch to him while I'm here.

01:00.961 --> 01:03.429
- NARRATOR: Angela gets
called out by her ex, Tor'i,

01:03.531 --> 01:05.731
for her DMs to her fantasy team.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.534
- You weren't Snapchatting
MLB and NBA players

01:08.636 --> 01:10.669
while we were together?
- NARRATOR: Go sports!

01:10.771 --> 01:14.473
Another ex arrives, and
you'll never guess who it is.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.342
And the house is shook

01:17.445 --> 01:20.079
when some exes are
sent home without warning.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.247
- Uh... [bleep].

01:24.085 --> 01:25.651

01:40.134 --> 01:41.667
- NARRATOR: Welcome back.

01:41.769 --> 01:45.471
Angela was pissed with a capital
P when her ex, Tor'i, washed up.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.106
So she ditched him at the beach

01:47.208 --> 01:48.674
and made her way back
to the house

01:48.776 --> 01:51.076
to tell everyone
he broke her bank account--

01:51.178 --> 01:53.278
I mean, her heart.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.746
- He walked up, and I was like,

01:54.849 --> 01:56.748
"I hope you didn't get
your checkbook wet,

01:56.851 --> 01:58.317
'cause you owe me money"

01:58.419 --> 02:00.719
"Bitch, you're a fraud.
You're a scammer."

02:00.821 --> 02:02.387
Said that he doesn't
owe me [bleep].

02:02.490 --> 02:04.456
I'm lying about the
whole money situation.

02:04.558 --> 02:07.860
- Oh, he's a full wack.
- ANGELA: It was so bad,

02:07.962 --> 02:09.862
Nurys was holding me
back from [unintelligible].

02:09.964 --> 02:10.929
- Wow.

02:11.031 --> 02:12.531
- I had Angela's back
even though

02:12.633 --> 02:14.233
I know we've had
our differences.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.368
Tor'i was antagonizing
her the whole time.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.903
That [bleep]
is so disrespectful.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.242
- What's up, guys?
- What's up?

02:23.344 --> 02:24.543
- How's it going?

02:27.214 --> 02:29.114
- Awkward!

02:29.216 --> 02:30.616
- I'm Tor'i.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.317
How's it going?
What's up with it?

02:32.419 --> 02:34.019
- COREY: What's going on?

02:34.121 --> 02:35.120
Good meet you.
- I'm Corey.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.589
- Tor'i.
Good to meet you.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.658
Angela needs to be held
accountable for her actions.

02:41.162 --> 02:44.296
She cheated on me on national
TV with Johnny Bananas.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.598
But I have my suspicion
she was cheating on me

02:46.700 --> 02:49.368
with multiple people.
Like, who does that?

02:49.470 --> 02:51.537
Good to meet you.
Good to meet you, boss.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.939
- Good to meet you, brother.
- Good to meet you, too.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.574
- Can I talk to you?
- Oh, yeah.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.709
- Tor'i walks in.
He's, like, all smiles.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.579
Like, I don't know if I, like,
fully trust Angela because

03:00.681 --> 03:03.282
she did cheat on him, but I'm
gonna get to the bottom of it.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.352
- You know how it is, because
his bro's on the beach.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.254
- ANGELA: Tori's
presence annoys me.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.790
His laugh is aggravating.

03:11.892 --> 03:14.493
- [laughs]

03:14.595 --> 03:15.928
- He makes me sick.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.363
I just need to be as far away
from him as possible

03:18.465 --> 03:19.898
to avoid killing him.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.236
So my plan moving forward is
just to ignore, ignore, ignore.

03:24.338 --> 03:26.438
- I have, like,
a million questions.

03:26.540 --> 03:27.839
What, were you all,
like, splitting rent?

03:27.942 --> 03:29.608
Like, was there, like,
a miscommunication?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.945
- I was taking on all the
financial responsibility myself,

03:33.047 --> 03:36.481
you know, from the first two or
three months we were together.

03:36.584 --> 03:39.718
And then when I tell her, like,
it's beginning to be too much,

03:39.820 --> 03:41.587
that's when she
stepped up and helped.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.522
You know, I'm like,
I found a ride or die,

03:43.624 --> 03:45.524
a chick that's gonna
have my back regardless.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.459
That's when she's like,
"Oh, I was paying your rent.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.860
I was doing this.
I was doing that."

03:48.963 --> 03:50.596
I'm like, "No, you
were pulling your share."

03:50.698 --> 03:52.231
- I feel a bit bad for Tor'i.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.865
Everything that Angela
said about him, like,

03:53.968 --> 03:56.168
isn't reflecting back at
me when I talk to him.

03:56.270 --> 03:59.304
- She, like, went to YouTube
to spread a bunch of rumors.

03:59.406 --> 04:03.308
- Someone did rob me, except
that person was my ex.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.310
He completely wiped
out my PayPal clean.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.212
I didn't realize
until I got to LA

04:07.314 --> 04:09.815
that I would have
to be supporting him.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.984
Dude, she cheated on me.
Like, that's what I'm saying.

04:12.086 --> 04:15.287
So she wanted to flip the
narrative to make people believe

04:15.389 --> 04:18.055
that I was such a bad guy that
they would feel sorry for her.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.858
She's been playing the victim
role since she got on TV,

04:20.961 --> 04:23.295
you know what I mean?
Like, I'm tired of that.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.397
- Did you forgive
her for cheating?

04:25.499 --> 04:26.865
- That's the sticky situation.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.800
Like, we didn't really
talk about it much.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.670
And her first time owning up
to it was at the beach today.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.306
- I would cheat on you
10 more times, bitch,

04:34.408 --> 04:36.174
'cause you're a
[bleep] bum, bitch!

04:36.277 --> 04:38.510
- Honestly, one of the biggest
pieces of advice is it gets

04:38.612 --> 04:40.479
a pressure cooker in here
and people pop off easily.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.447
Keep your tone down.
I got into it with

04:42.549 --> 04:44.316
[bleep] [unintelligible]
last night.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.585
- You [unintelligible].
- Go ahead, [bleep] baby.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.020
- Then stop talking--
- Go ahead.

04:48.122 --> 04:49.655
- Then stop talking [bleep].
Like I thought.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.857
- I ain't talking [bleep].
Go eat Jozea's food.

04:51.959 --> 04:52.924
- [crunching]

04:53.027 --> 04:55.494
- He wanted to eliminate
four exes last night.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.896
He was like, "They're eating
my food, taking my bed."

04:57.998 --> 05:00.899
I was like, "That is
not your [bleep] food."

05:01.001 --> 05:03.068
I was like,
"Dude, that's not your food."

05:03.170 --> 05:04.836
Like, exes are people, too.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.505
- [laughing] Exes
are people, too!

05:06.607 --> 05:09.141
- There's no [bleep] rulebook
where, like, we are,

05:09.243 --> 05:10.242
like, above these people.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.777
We have the power
to vote them out.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.680
But as far, like, you
know, being over someone,

05:14.782 --> 05:16.415
that's as far as it goes.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.084
- So we're gonna be here.
It's gonna be a good time.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.185
- We're stuck in here, man.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.556
- ANNOUNCER: Sorry, Tor'i, but
Corey's only talking to you

05:24.658 --> 05:27.859
because he's lonely ever since
he lost his cuddle buddy, Jozea.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.828

of catching up to do.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.247

05:53.520 --> 05:54.820
- NARRATOR:
Speaking of panties,

05:54.922 --> 05:57.522
let's see who's got
Chad's panties in a bunch.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.191
- I can't figure out what
Maddie's doing there.

05:59.293 --> 06:01.526
I feel like she's trying to turn
him to her side or something.

06:01.628 --> 06:04.329
- Oh, bro, you know it.
- Who cares?

06:04.431 --> 06:05.797
- CHAD: I don't think
that's gonna happen.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.332
I mean,
Maddie's a great girl.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.101
Yeah, she can be rude.
She's sucks sometimes.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.069
She's hot, though.
But at the end of the day,

06:11.171 --> 06:14.573
I have decided 110%
to give my heart to Nicole.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.741
So for me right now,

06:15.843 --> 06:18.009
the only thing
I can think about is gains

06:18.112 --> 06:19.044
before...

06:20.848 --> 06:21.880
...titties.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.983
- Just open the door
real quick and be like--

06:25.085 --> 06:26.885
- I'm gonna say "chicken legs!"
or something.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.920
- Something to [bleep] with
him all day, [bleep] that.

06:29.022 --> 06:31.823
- If I was to write a book about
me and Chad's relationship,

06:31.925 --> 06:35.060
it would be, like,
"How Can Malibitch Barbie

06:35.162 --> 06:38.697
and Bobybuilder Boy [bleep]
with Each Other This Time?"

06:38.799 --> 06:40.465
Maybe instead of
working out your arms,

06:40.567 --> 06:43.001
you should work out your legs.
Chicken legs!

06:43.103 --> 06:45.103
- What a [bleep] bitch.
- Just go. Go on.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.438
- [laughs]

06:46.540 --> 06:48.039
- She's just trying
to stir [bleep] up.

06:48.142 --> 06:49.341
- That's funny.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.675
Totally rude.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.711
- [unintelligible]

06:52.813 --> 06:55.480
- Low blows!
A low blow!

06:55.582 --> 06:57.916

06:58.018 --> 07:00.252

what nobody asked for--

07:00.354 --> 07:02.988
The return of some
familiar faces.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.624
Oh, man! I can't wait.

We're just, like, best friends.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.104
- I'll just be a
bitch to him while I'm here.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.940
- Maddie has, like, a little
demon hidden inside her.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.342
Like, she looks like this
little angel, but, like,

07:24.445 --> 07:26.077
she's got a dark side
to her, you know?

07:26.180 --> 07:29.614
And she's definitely showing
her, you know, other colors.

07:29.716 --> 07:31.683
They're coming out to play.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.084

07:33.187 --> 07:34.686

- Oh god.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.354
- You've been served.

07:36.457 --> 07:42.561

07:44.498 --> 07:46.498

even your house!

07:46.600 --> 07:47.899
You don't own it!

07:49.069 --> 07:50.735
Aah!

07:50.838 --> 07:52.871
- Y'all have me dying
when y'all go at it.

07:52.973 --> 07:54.706
It's the funniest [bleep] ever.

07:56.510 --> 08:02.380
- ♪

08:02.483 --> 08:04.850

be over, and we've made it
through all this [bleep].

08:07.988 --> 08:10.055
- It's been a freaking
roller coaster.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.556
- It's crazy.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.692

Head out!

Tor'i looks a little nervous.

Maybe Angela's gonna
pull out these receipts.

I wanna see them.

while we were together.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.703

been honest with me

reasoning behind it?

"It just looks bad

16:12.205 --> 16:14.138

respect for Nicole,

That is disrespectful to Nicole

16:28.355 --> 16:29.687

16:34.027 --> 16:35.426

with a girl.

I flirt, but I'm a flirt.

it would be very
interesting to me

16:46.272 --> 16:47.705

16:47.807 --> 16:49.741

26:55.615 --> 26:58.449
but this time I'm gonna
let Diandra read it.

26:58.551 --> 26:59.917
- Me?
- NURYS: Yeah!

27:00.019 --> 27:01.719
- DIANDRA: We have another
message in the bottle.

27:01.821 --> 27:05.322
And I'm like, what the
[bleep] is about to go down?

27:05.424 --> 27:06.857
"Nurys has chosen
to bring Nelson

27:06.959 --> 27:08.626
"back into the house for Angela.

27:08.728 --> 27:12.062
"As a result, Nurys, you must
send home one ex immediately.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.865
Please choose now."

27:14.967 --> 27:16.166
- Holy [bleep]!

27:16.268 --> 27:19.303
- So obviously this
decision is a little hard.

27:19.405 --> 27:22.506
- PEREZ: I am a little scared.
[farts]

27:25.077 --> 27:27.277
- But I think
what's best for the house--

27:27.380 --> 27:29.480
I have all the power.

27:29.582 --> 27:31.815
I've been wanting
this for a while.

27:31.917 --> 27:34.318
The mean girls always think that
they have everything in control.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.653
Now it's up to me.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.087
I bet you guys
never expected that.

27:37.189 --> 27:42.660
--And best for the relationships
in this house is for...

27:44.664 --> 27:45.796
...Maddie to go home.

27:45.898 --> 27:49.033
- Holy [bleep]!
- Oof!

27:49.135 --> 27:50.701
- I don't blame
Nurys on this one.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.636
I think Nurys is
close with Nicole.

27:52.738 --> 27:54.171
She sees that Chad
is struggling.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.473
Like, the longer Maddie
stays in the house,

27:56.575 --> 27:58.676
the more drama there is
between Chad and Maddie.

27:58.778 --> 28:01.812
- Sorry, Maddie, but I want
Nicole and Chad to really

28:01.914 --> 28:04.248
work things out
outside of this house.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.949
And you being here
is not beneficial

28:06.052 --> 28:10.254
to their relationship,
so... sorry.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.690
- I wanted this moment.
You know, I wanted her gone.

28:12.792 --> 28:14.258
It's just I felt
she started getting

28:14.360 --> 28:15.559
mean and snarky and stuff.

28:15.661 --> 28:17.428
And in my best interests
of my relationship,

28:17.530 --> 28:20.964
she did need to go.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.400
- Well, it was nice
knowing you, Maddie.

- Yes, we're growing.

29:30.669 --> 29:31.835
- Do you see that?

29:31.937 --> 29:33.537
Nurys is just
a better woman than me

29:33.639 --> 29:35.372
for bringing Nelson back up.
She didn't have to.

29:35.474 --> 29:36.907
We've had our ups and downs.

29:37.009 --> 29:40.244
And if the tables were turned,
and it was me down in that shack

29:40.346 --> 29:42.479
bringing up someone from her,
I might not have done it.

29:42.581 --> 29:43.714
Actually, I'm pretty
sure I wouldn't have.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.883

29:55.494 --> 29:56.960
- Sheesh.

29:57.062 --> 29:58.796

- I might crush her.

- Malcolm, isn't his-- you know
what you talked about before?

30:01.567 --> 30:02.699
- This is not a three-way.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.568
At this point with
me and Malcolm,

30:04.670 --> 30:06.036
I feel like what
we have is real.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.704
He's honestly becoming my
best friend at this point,

30:07.807 --> 30:09.039
and I love it.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.942
I do feel like I am
willing now to trust him.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.511
- Straight line!
- A two-way or a no way.

This is not a three-way.

It's just not the
one you're expecting.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.190
- MORGAN: Draw me!
- I'm scared.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.125
- Chad, who knew you
were such an artiste?

30:29.662 --> 30:31.862
- Boom. That's you.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.631

- Wait, draw me.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.638
- Hold on.
- Why am I a dill pickle?

30:41.740 --> 30:43.006
- 'Cause you're,
like, a fun pickle.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.842
- You're sour and
people like to bite you.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.276
- You're a
happy pickle at that.

30:46.378 --> 30:47.377
- Here you go, Morgan.

30:47.479 --> 30:48.445

30:49.648 --> 30:50.781

to take a stand,

30:52.952 --> 30:54.318
Chad-- don't talk
to her like that!

30:56.288 --> 30:58.488
- CHAD: So it's, like, day
three now without Nicole,

30:58.591 --> 31:01.158
and there's just nothing more
to do in the house, you know?

31:01.260 --> 31:02.492
We've already bro'd out.

31:02.595 --> 31:04.828
- Pose number one-- go!
Ooh, obliques.

31:04.930 --> 31:06.964
Pose number two!
Ooh, solid bicep.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.966
Pose number three.
Double bicep.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.901
Pose number four!
Superman.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.707
- It's a cookietini.

31:16.809 --> 31:19.343
I really just want my
girl back, you know?

31:20.613 --> 31:24.581
With the final elimination
- coming up, the end is near.!

31:24.683 --> 31:26.650
- If we all give a
crush to someone,

31:26.752 --> 31:27.985
all of those people are safe.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.287
The people who
don't have crushes--

31:30.389 --> 31:31.889
- Right.
- Yes, crush.

31:31.991 --> 31:33.523
- I've never seen
that happen before.

31:33.626 --> 31:34.958
- Everyone we give a crush.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.960
It'll either be a tie
or it'll go the exes,

31:37.062 --> 31:38.428
and then they could tie itup.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.230
- Okay, so each of
us give a crush,

31:40.332 --> 31:42.933
and then between those
people, they get a--

31:43.035 --> 31:45.535
- It's never been
just one crush--

31:45.638 --> 31:47.738
- We're all gonna be like
no cuts!

31:47.840 --> 31:50.173
- We're gonna say all love.
- It's all love.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.441
- [shouting]

31:51.543 --> 31:52.743
- It's all love, baby!

31:52.845 --> 31:54.778
- MAYA: With this being
the last elimination,

31:54.880 --> 31:56.280
we all decided to switch it up.

31:56.382 --> 31:59.917
I'm queen of cutting, and for
once I want to show some love.

32:00.019 --> 32:04.121
So we all decide to crush people
that either we are together with

32:04.223 --> 32:07.291
or people that we had a problem
with, but we want to squash it.

32:07.393 --> 32:09.026
- There he is.

32:09.128 --> 32:12.863
- So we came up with this
plan to crush everyone,

32:12.965 --> 32:15.499
and then we make
the exes decide.

32:15.601 --> 32:16.934
- MORGAN: We feel like
we could end

32:17.036 --> 32:19.136
on a positive note,
crush everyone.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.837
- So [unintelligible]
it up today?

32:20.940 --> 32:22.272
- Exes, but--
- But there's still--

32:22.374 --> 32:23.907
It's not gonna end
on a positive note.

32:24.009 --> 32:25.208
Someone's gonna be voted out.

32:25.311 --> 32:26.877
And I don't have
anyone to crush on.

32:26.979 --> 32:29.446
So I could just cut somebody.
- Crush Corey?

32:29.548 --> 32:31.348
- Basically because all
you guys wanna crush,

32:31.450 --> 32:33.283
and I'm gonna do the opposite.
What do you say?

32:33.385 --> 32:35.786
- There it is.
- That sounds about right.

32:35.888 --> 32:38.322
- Actually, that makes sense.

32:38.424 --> 32:41.124
- Every time I've ever wanted
you to cut, you crush.

32:41.226 --> 32:43.894
- Can we cut Cory
tonight, please?

32:43.996 --> 32:47.931
Corey never goes with the group.
He is so annoying.

32:48.033 --> 32:49.967
- So when they are asked,

32:50.069 --> 32:51.969
because you know
they ask "Who cut me?"

32:52.071 --> 32:53.437
- Alright.
- Alright.

32:53.539 --> 32:56.039
Fine. I support it.
I'm gonna need that same energy.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.041
- And I'll support
you on that cut, too.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.077
- So we have a game
plan, then, you know?

33:00.179 --> 33:01.144
- Perfect.

33:01.246 --> 33:03.513
- So, like, you
suck, but whatever.

33:03.615 --> 33:04.815
- Don't care what
you think, Morgan.

33:04.917 --> 33:06.116
- We can't win with this guy.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.651
So we're letting him
do what he wants,

33:07.753 --> 33:10.253
and we're just gonna crush who
we need to crush, and that's it.

33:10.356 --> 33:13.390
And whoever he cuts, he cuts.
- Yeah.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.826
- NARRATOR: Corey
plays by Corey's rules.

33:15.928 --> 33:18.762
- Two, three...
- ALL: Crush!

33:18.864 --> 33:20.130
- MORGAN: And then
there's Corey.

33:21.934 --> 33:24.634
Alright, well, that was good.

33:24.737 --> 33:26.903
- God, Morgan's so annoying.
- Why?

33:27.006 --> 33:28.038
- 'Cause she's just an idiot.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.773
I can't wait
until we get out of here

33:29.875 --> 33:31.908
just to get away from her.

33:32.011 --> 33:33.810
It's a good thing she chose
a dude from "Survivor"

33:33.912 --> 33:35.846
'cause I couldn't
survive a month with her.

33:38.884 --> 33:40.283
- I'm actually waiting
on the cooking.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.552
- We could talk now or after
you're done, I don't care.

33:42.654 --> 33:43.653
- We can talk now.

33:43.756 --> 33:45.122
- ANGELA:
Both of us played a role

33:45.224 --> 33:47.591
in the demise
of our relationship.

33:47.693 --> 33:51.061
I cheated.
He stole from me.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.530
Ew, I'm, like, shaking. Ew!

33:53.632 --> 33:56.199
- First, I want to start
off by apologizing to you,

33:56.301 --> 33:58.735
telling you I'm sorry for
the way I treated you.

33:58.837 --> 33:59.803
You were there for me.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.371
You moved across
country to live with me.

34:01.473 --> 34:03.607
And...

34:03.709 --> 34:07.544
I did you wrong,
you know, for--

34:07.646 --> 34:09.012
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

34:11.984 --> 34:14.851
- If you're still so
emotionally invested in someone,

34:14.953 --> 34:17.387
you still kind of care for
them someway, somehow.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.089
That's why I always
told Morgan, like,

34:19.190 --> 34:21.158
why are you upset that Corey
Brooks is walking around?

34:21.260 --> 34:23.893
Because you care.
So...

34:23.996 --> 34:25.529
Angela might
still like Tor'i.

34:27.099 --> 34:28.565
- I appreciate your apology.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.568
[sniffs]

34:31.670 --> 34:34.036
- I know I have to live
in this house with Angela.

34:34.139 --> 34:37.741
So I'll say sorry as many
times as I need to.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.009
I know that ultimately,

34:39.110 --> 34:40.577
it'll make my stay
a little bit easier.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.712
You know, I know we were
going through our struggles,

34:42.815 --> 34:45.815
but to know that, like, you
stepped outside of what we had,

34:45.918 --> 34:47.684
like, I would never
do that to you.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.652
- And I apologize.
It was wrong.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.054
I shouldn't have done it.

34:53.158 --> 34:54.991
- I don't know where
to go from here.

34:55.094 --> 34:58.995
I just know I do
still care about you.

34:59.098 --> 35:02.165
- Maybe because we had so
much chemistry during

35:02.267 --> 35:05.902
our relationship, that's kind
of hard to just disappear.

35:06.004 --> 35:08.004
But my heart is
still with Nelson.

35:08.107 --> 35:10.440
It's just.. the
[bleep] situation.

- PEREZ: So tonight's
the final elimination.

36:19.778 --> 36:22.879
Me and Tur'I are highest on
the chopping block right now--

36:22.981 --> 36:24.414
Mainly, in my situation,

36:24.516 --> 36:26.783
because of the lack of
connections that I've made.

36:26.885 --> 36:30.287
But it would be unfortunate
'cause I would like to stay,

36:30.389 --> 36:33.690
I'm having a good time, and
I've enjoyed my time here.

36:37.196 --> 36:39.596
- TUR'I: This is the beginning
of a fresh start

36:39.698 --> 36:40.997
for Angela and I.

36:41.099 --> 36:42.899
It really feels like I'm
on the chopping block.

36:43.001 --> 36:44.201
I don't want to go home

36:44.303 --> 36:46.403
because I don't have
to avoid her anymore,

36:46.505 --> 36:49.706
so that makes my time
here a lot more fun.

36:49.808 --> 36:51.441
I get to
enjoy myself now.

to cut or crush.

Exes, one by one you'll come
forward to the pink pineapples,

38:00.312 --> 38:02.445
and I'll count how
many crush votes you have,

38:02.547 --> 38:04.414
how many cut votes
you've receive.

38:04.516 --> 38:06.516
The ex with the most
cut votes has gotta go.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.752
They'll be leaving.

38:08.854 --> 38:12.756
Now, a reminder-- a crush
vote cancels out a cut vote.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.991
Hopefully some of y'all got
in enough crush votes

38:15.093 --> 38:16.526

We got seven crushes.

38:55.634 --> 38:58.068
This looks like it's
going towards maybe a tie.

38:58.170 --> 39:01.971
That's history, which
means one vote is left.
