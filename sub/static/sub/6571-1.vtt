00:01.014 --> 00:04.006
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:04.118 --> 00:06.177
<i>and the one son who had no choice...</i>

00:06.286 --> 00:08.618
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.128 --> 00:15.789
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:19.633 --> 00:21.601
<i>This is Michael Bluth.</i>

00:21.702 --> 00:25.900
<i>Right now he's taking his son, George Michael,
to start a new life in Arizona.</i>

00:26.006 --> 00:28.770
Phoenix, Arizona, huh?
This is it, boy.

00:28.876 --> 00:30.867
We are free.

00:30.978 --> 00:32.969
We're gonna follow our dreams,
you know?

00:33.080 --> 00:35.981
And the best part of it?
Not workin' for the family anymore.

00:36.083 --> 00:39.382
Yeah, but don't-
don't you always say "family first"?

00:39.486 --> 00:44.150
Yes, I do.
But that is not a family, okay?

00:44.258 --> 00:48.194
They're a bunch of greedy, selfish people
who have our nose.

00:48.295 --> 00:51.696
- And Aunt Lindsay.
- She's not my real aunt?

00:51.799 --> 00:55.064
Not a real nose. Got a picture of her
when she's 14 in a swimming cap.

00:55.169 --> 00:57.137
She looks like a falcon.

00:57.237 --> 01:01.333
Spent an entire year living in that
stupid model home with those people...

01:01.442 --> 01:03.603
and all they did was lie to us.

01:03.710 --> 01:07.578
<i>The most recent lie was Michael's
father had had a heart attack while in prison.</i>

01:07.681 --> 01:10.411
We lost him.

01:10.517 --> 01:14.248
<i>What the doctor meant to say
was that George Sr. Had escaped...</i>

01:14.354 --> 01:17.949
<i>a feat he'd accomplished by using
the family's portable stairway vehicle.</i>

01:20.194 --> 01:23.095
I'd love to see the look on their faces
right now.

01:23.197 --> 01:26.428
- "Where'd he go?"
- Or they- they think we're just headed home.

01:26.533 --> 01:29.001
Actually, you know,
that's kind of what I thought...

01:29.103 --> 01:31.298
until I heard about
all that Phoenix stuff.

01:31.405 --> 01:35.102
<i>Michael was concerned
that the full impact ofhis departure...</i>

01:35.209 --> 01:37.769
<i>might have been lost on his family.</i>

01:37.878 --> 01:40.540
- Hello. Who is this?
- Yes, this is Dr. Blumen.

01:40.647 --> 01:43.081
I'm calling regarding Michael Bluth.

01:43.183 --> 01:47.119
Michael! Phone!

01:47.221 --> 01:51.487
They think we're still there.
We're goin' back.

01:51.592 --> 01:54.561
Hey, Mom. Any messages?

01:54.661 --> 01:57.186
None.

01:57.297 --> 01:59.231
No, there was a message.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.301
It was about my health,
but it doesn't matter.

02:01.401 --> 02:03.301
My son and l-

02:03.403 --> 02:05.963
<i>Buster, what are you doing
with Mother's rape horn?</i>

02:06.073 --> 02:11.136
<i>Yes, I have a rape horn, Michael,
because you took away my mace.</i>

02:11.245 --> 02:14.646
Yeah, like anyone would want to "R" her.

02:14.748 --> 02:16.648
This is what I'm talking about, Michael.

02:16.750 --> 02:20.743
<i>Now that your father has deserted us,
Buster's become impossible to control.</i>

02:20.854 --> 02:24.085
<i>Suddenly he's too much of a big shot
to brush Mother's hair.</i>

02:24.191 --> 02:25.818
Well, I'm not he-

02:28.662 --> 02:32.098
I'm not helping you
with Buster anymore.

02:32.199 --> 02:34.895
I'm not helping anyone with anything.

02:35.002 --> 02:37.869
I came here to tell you
that my son and l-

02:43.443 --> 02:46.571
<i>George Michael, meanwhile,
was approached by his cousin Maeby.</i>

02:46.680 --> 02:48.773
So, you're really leavin', huh?

02:48.882 --> 02:51.578
Have you told your girlfriend, Bland?
I mean, Ann.

02:51.685 --> 02:55.086
- She's not my girlfriend, and she's not bland.
- Really?

02:55.189 --> 02:57.783
Because, I mean, under her school picture
it said "not pictured."

02:57.891 --> 03:00.416
Okay, they printed a retraction
in the spring supplement.

03:00.527 --> 03:03.758
And, yeah, she was really lookin' forward
to seeing me in my Uncle Sam outfit...

03:03.864 --> 03:06.059
<i>in that Get Out The Vote
assembly tomorrow.</i>

03:06.166 --> 03:08.191
Wasn't that supposed to be
before the election?

03:08.302 --> 03:11.362
They had to postpone it when that foreign
exchange student parked too close to the gym.

03:11.471 --> 03:13.564
I do it. I play Uncle Sam.

03:13.674 --> 03:16.973
Better than part I have now-
guy who orders strike on Pearl Harbor.

03:17.077 --> 03:20.569
<i>I don't know why you're not taking
this "I'm out ofhere"seriously...</i>

03:20.681 --> 03:23.912
but I am out of here, seriously.

03:24.017 --> 03:27.544
- Let's face it, Michael.
You've made this threat before.
- Tell me. When?

03:29.223 --> 03:31.987
That's it. I'm out of here.

03:36.129 --> 03:38.791
- Ta-da!
- I'm out of here.

03:38.899 --> 03:42.027
<i>We got the attacking animal down.</i>

03:42.135 --> 03:44.729
I'm out of this family, seriously.

03:44.838 --> 03:47.807
This time we're gonna be so far away,
you'll never be able to find us.

03:47.908 --> 03:50.172
- We're goin' to Phoenix.
- Don't tell 'em where.

03:50.277 --> 03:52.302
- L-I just thought-
- It doesn't matter why.

03:52.412 --> 03:54.880
Michael, maybe the reason
why you always come back...

03:54.982 --> 03:57.576
is because you need us
more than we need you.

03:57.684 --> 03:59.811
Oh, that's rich.

03:59.920 --> 04:04.016
Huh. I need you.
All right, I'll tell you what.

04:04.124 --> 04:06.820
<i>Mom, you're always asking me
to help you look after Buster.</i>

04:06.927 --> 04:09.521
You can find somebody else.
I hope she doesn't kill you.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.928
I'll kill her first.

04:12.032 --> 04:15.695
And good luck trying to find someone else
to run the business, by the way.

04:15.802 --> 04:18.269
Gob, instead of always coming to me
asking me for money...

04:18.372 --> 04:20.363
saying, "I've made a huge mistake"...

04:20.474 --> 04:22.499
you can bail yourself out next time.

04:22.609 --> 04:26.773
I've never admitted to a mistake.
What would I have made a mistake about?

04:26.880 --> 04:30.372
<i>Lindsay, instead of sleeping in twin beds,
you and your husband take the master bedroom.</i>

04:30.484 --> 04:33.453
It's not like you've never come to me
with your marital problems...

04:33.553 --> 04:36.545
saying, "Oh, help me, Michael.
I think my husband might be a"-

04:36.657 --> 04:38.557
Ohh!

04:38.659 --> 04:42.993
- Well- It's-
- Here we go.

04:43.096 --> 04:47.032
<i>And so, once again, the guys were
on their way to Phoenix, never to look back.</i>

04:47.134 --> 04:49.034
It's just the lab calling.

04:49.136 --> 04:51.229
We'll give him the bad news in Phoenix.

04:51.338 --> 04:53.806
- They know we're gone.
- Great.

04:53.907 --> 04:57.502
You did say Phoenix again,
but what do we care?

04:57.611 --> 04:59.511
Sorry.

04:59.613 --> 05:04.573
Now, do you want to steer, or are you
too old to sit on your pop's lap and drive?

05:08.155 --> 05:10.146
I think I might be.

05:10.257 --> 05:12.157
Okay.

05:23.603 --> 05:26.071
Car's registered to George Bluth,
so we had to check.

05:26.173 --> 05:29.336
- But he's been caught, so you're free to go.
- He's been caught?

05:29.443 --> 05:31.911
<i>Michael knew
ifhe went back to see his father...</i>

05:32.012 --> 05:34.879
<i>he would only end up
saying something hurtful.</i>

05:34.981 --> 05:37.279
We're goin' back.

05:37.384 --> 05:40.046
<i>In fact, the police only
thought they'd arrested George Sr.</i>

05:40.153 --> 05:43.850
Do you have any cookies
with no preservatives?

05:43.957 --> 05:46.619
<i>But had gotten
his twin brother, Oscar, instead.</i>

05:46.727 --> 05:49.355
- Oscar! A tall tea for Oscar!
- Yeah!

05:49.463 --> 05:51.863
Oh, good grief. It's Oscar.

05:51.965 --> 05:54.866
Oh, thank God you've come.

05:54.968 --> 05:58.404
<i>Lucille had a relationship
with Oscar years earlier...</i>

05:58.505 --> 06:00.973
<i>- which she was not eager to rekindle.
- What is wrong with you?</i>

06:01.074 --> 06:03.042
- The boy is here.
- Oh.

06:03.143 --> 06:07.204
<i>- They said my father was here.
- Did they?</i>

06:09.483 --> 06:12.452
- Let's get out of here.
- What-What about Oscar?

06:12.552 --> 06:14.918
Yes. They impounded my, uh-
my humble trailer.

06:15.021 --> 06:16.921
- You'll stay with us.
- No, he won't.

06:17.023 --> 06:19.218
You're the one who says
I need a father figure.

06:19.326 --> 06:22.659
Yes. A father figure.

06:24.698 --> 06:27.394
Fine. But you're not sleeping
in my bed.

06:27.501 --> 06:29.969
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

06:31.671 --> 06:34.162
<i>Soon, Michael arrived to claim his father...</i>

06:34.274 --> 06:37.175
<i>and was met by the family attorney,
Barry Zuckerkorn.</i>

06:37.277 --> 06:39.245
- Hmm.
- No, I know, I know, I know.

06:39.346 --> 06:41.906
Everybody says leave it alone,
leave it alone.

06:42.015 --> 06:44.745
Does this look contagious to you?
Hey, kiddo.

06:44.851 --> 06:47.251
All right. It wasn't your father.

06:47.354 --> 06:50.255
It was your uncle.
I ran into them as they were leaving.

06:50.357 --> 06:52.450
There he is! Got ya!

06:52.559 --> 06:55.687
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Yeah!

06:55.796 --> 06:59.095
I only came back to tell him I was leaving,
so I guess it's time to go, Son.

06:59.199 --> 07:01.997
- Where you going?
- We can't tell you.

07:02.102 --> 07:04.764
No, no. We can tell Barry.
We're going to Phoenix.

07:04.871 --> 07:07.066
Oh, I wish you hadn't have said that.

07:07.174 --> 07:10.143
As your lawyer, I have to inform you
you cannot leave the state.

07:10.243 --> 07:12.438
With your father gone,
they want to hold you.

07:12.546 --> 07:14.776
- M-Me?
- They're going to indict you tomorrow.

07:14.881 --> 07:18.476
All you have to do is come up with the bail.
Take it out of the business.

07:18.585 --> 07:21.611
But l- I can't. I quit. I don't want
to follow in my father's footsteps.

07:21.721 --> 07:24.815
Then you might wind up on his cot.

07:24.925 --> 07:30.056
Oh, man, I wish you hadn't
said Phoenix. Wow.

07:31.963 --> 07:32.297
<i>Michael had just found out
he couldn't leave the state...</i>

07:32.297 --> 07:34.527
<i>Michael had just found out
he couldn't leave the state...</i>

07:34.632 --> 07:36.532
<i>unless he came up with bail.</i>

07:36.634 --> 07:39.899
Okay, listen. I'm gonna get the company
checkbook and don't tell the family.

07:40.004 --> 07:43.132
We can't give them the satisfaction of
telling them that I need money, okay?

07:43.241 --> 07:46.540
- Do you remember what we say about the family?
- It's not Aunt Lindsay's nose.

07:46.644 --> 07:48.202
Yes, but no.

07:48.313 --> 07:50.713
Don't- Don't tell them
that we were goin' to-

07:50.815 --> 07:53.807
- We say we don't need them. Hmm?
- Oh. Yeah. Okay.

07:53.918 --> 07:56.352
The new one. I didn't-

07:56.454 --> 07:59.116
<i>It comes
from knowing you're toned and fit.</i>

07:59.224 --> 08:01.488
- What are you doing?
- I'm exercising, Michael.

08:01.593 --> 08:04.858
I see you found an exercise tape
made for people as lazy as you are.

08:04.963 --> 08:08.228
- I do have a love life.
- Tighten, one, two, three.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.233
Okay, this is going off.

08:10.335 --> 08:14.396
<i>One night in the master bedroom,
and you got yourself a love life again?</i>

08:14.506 --> 08:16.701
Well, I'll be honest.
At first, it was awkward.

08:16.808 --> 08:20.574
Together, two, three, four.

08:20.678 --> 08:23.306
<i>- Release, two, three, four.
- Oh, Lindsay.</i>

08:23.414 --> 08:28.113
Uh, well, this is exciting.

08:28.219 --> 08:31.017
- Finally we can be a normal couple.
- Nice to be back in a queen.

08:33.323 --> 08:35.292
- It's too much pressure.
- I can't do this.

08:35.393 --> 08:39.352
<i>So Lindsay and Tobias finally
took a hard look at their relationship.</i>

08:39.464 --> 08:43.957
You know, Lindsay, as a therapist,
I have advised a number of couples...

08:44.068 --> 08:47.060
<i>to explore an open relationship...</i>

08:47.171 --> 08:50.163
where-where the couple
remains emotionally committed...

08:50.275 --> 08:54.075
but free to explore
extramarital encounters.

08:54.178 --> 08:57.204
- Did it work for those people?
- No. It never does.

08:57.315 --> 09:01.775
These people somehow delude themselves
into thinking it might, but-

09:03.421 --> 09:06.356
but it might work for us.

09:06.457 --> 09:10.052
- We could give it a shot.
- Great. We'll hammer out the details later.

09:10.161 --> 09:12.925
Right now we've got a daughter to tell.

09:13.031 --> 09:15.795
Maeby, we're having a family meeting!

09:15.900 --> 09:19.233
<i>- On her way to the family meeting...
- Family meeting!</i>

09:19.337 --> 09:21.271
<i>- Lindsay had an unexpected encounter.
- Hello.</i>

09:21.372 --> 09:23.101
Oh, hi. Gob told me to come by.

09:23.207 --> 09:24.902
Well, uh, I don't think he's here.

09:25.009 --> 09:28.001
Well, tell him I like what I see.

09:29.747 --> 09:33.080
And we probably won't even act on it.
We're not gonna get a divorce.

09:33.184 --> 09:35.744
If anything, it'll bring
Mommy and Daddy closer together.

09:35.853 --> 09:37.821
I met someone. I've got a date.

09:37.922 --> 09:39.822
I'm dating someone.

09:40.925 --> 09:46.659
Well.
Let the great experiment begin!

09:46.764 --> 09:50.427
- You're not using my master bedroom for that.
- I believe you left.

09:50.535 --> 09:52.662
Or did you realize
how much you need us after all?

09:52.770 --> 09:55.364
- Actually, I came back because I need something.
- Hmm.

09:55.473 --> 09:59.432
Some things. Like the checkbook.
Where's the corporate checkbook?

09:59.544 --> 10:01.774
Gob must've taken it to the office.

10:01.879 --> 10:05.940
<i>Mom put him in charge.
That's right, Michael. He's got your oldjob.</i>

10:06.050 --> 10:09.508
Well, I better get over there before
he brings the whole company down.

10:09.621 --> 10:12.647
It's only been three hours.
How much damage could he really do?

10:12.757 --> 10:14.657
And release.

10:14.759 --> 10:19.628
<i>In three hours,
Gob had done $45,000 in damage.</i>

10:19.731 --> 10:21.699
In there, please.

10:23.468 --> 10:26.130
Hey, where's my desk?

10:26.237 --> 10:29.297
Oh, I think it's the massage table
in the break room now.

10:30.341 --> 10:32.172
- Take the window.
- No, hold it.

10:32.276 --> 10:34.540
Gob, Mom may think
that she's given you my job...

10:34.646 --> 10:36.841
but the board still has to
approve that decision.

10:36.948 --> 10:40.213
- Actually, they already have.
- Why should we believe in you?

10:40.318 --> 10:43.253
For the same reason you should
believe that a hundred-dollar bill...

10:43.354 --> 10:46.517
is no more than a hundred pennies.

10:49.761 --> 10:51.319
<i>They approved me unanimously.</i>

10:51.429 --> 10:54.592
Why wouldn't they?
You've only lost them $99 so far.

10:54.699 --> 10:56.758
I've already been pretty successful.

10:56.868 --> 10:59.996
Showing the model house again.
Sent a Realtor over there yesterday.

11:00.104 --> 11:03.699
<i>It was this Realtor who'd run into
Lindsay, thinking she was looking for a home.</i>

11:03.808 --> 11:07.676
I have an open thing goin' on too.
I'll give you the address, and you can come by.

11:07.779 --> 11:10.748
<i>And I think you'll really
like the neighbors.</i>

11:10.848 --> 11:12.679
Okay.

11:12.784 --> 11:15.878
So what brings you here?
I hope it's not for a handout.

11:15.987 --> 11:18.353
I run a pretty tight ship around here.

11:18.456 --> 11:21.118
- With a pool table?
- It's a gaming ship.

11:21.225 --> 11:25.093
<i>I'm here because
I thought you might need me.</i>

11:26.264 --> 11:28.391
- I need you?
- That's right.

11:28.499 --> 11:30.933
Oh, boy, that's good.

11:31.035 --> 11:34.903
Can't wait to call the guys in
to hear this one.

11:35.006 --> 11:37.531
Listen-
How do you intercom on this?

11:37.642 --> 11:39.633
- Star two.
- Yeah. At the same time?

11:39.744 --> 11:41.712
Yeah, just-
No, the star in the corner. The star.

11:41.813 --> 11:44.281
- So if I do it like that-
- No, turn it around the other way. Star.

11:44.382 --> 11:46.850
- Oh, that star.
- Let's just hang it up. There we go.

11:46.951 --> 11:50.148
L-I thought that you might need me
to help you with the books.

11:50.254 --> 11:53.121
You know, the corporate checkbook.
Where is it?

11:53.224 --> 11:56.853
Actually, Mom's got it.
She wasn't comfortable with me-

11:56.961 --> 11:59.429
<i>Michael now had the distasteful choice...</i>

11:59.530 --> 12:02.158
<i>of either asking his mother for money
or going tojail.</i>

12:02.266 --> 12:05.064
Maybe Buster killed her already.

12:05.169 --> 12:07.637
<i>Tobias was also having a bad day.</i>

12:07.739 --> 12:11.140
<i>Lindsay had met someone,
and he hadn't.</i>

12:11.242 --> 12:15.508
<i>And that's when he found what he thought
was a support group for depressed men.</i>

12:19.383 --> 12:21.977
Well, if it isn't the boy
who cried "Phoenix."

12:22.086 --> 12:26.079
Ohh! No, I was just, uh-
just worried about Buster.

12:26.190 --> 12:30.092
<i>I thought maybe I should
give him a little guidance.</i>

12:30.194 --> 12:33.254
Write him a check. Be a role model.
Where's the company checkbook?

12:33.364 --> 12:35.832
I already have a new role model,
Michael.

12:35.933 --> 12:39.801
- His Uncle Oscar is living here now.
- Wow.

12:39.904 --> 12:42.702
You guys have accomplished a lot
in the last three hours.

12:42.807 --> 12:45.708
- Where is he?
- I sent him out for a new air horn.

12:50.548 --> 12:53.449
Yeah!

12:53.551 --> 12:56.884
- We've got it all under control.
- Great.

12:58.923 --> 13:02.484
I'm just worried that it's
only gonna be a matter of time...

13:02.593 --> 13:06.120
before the media starts putting together
all the pieces of this Iraq story.

13:06.230 --> 13:08.892
<i>Michael had recently
found out that the model home...</i>

13:09.000 --> 13:11.560
<i>he and his son currently lived in...</i>

13:11.669 --> 13:16.470
<i>was very similar to some his father
may have illegally been building in Iraq.</i>

13:16.574 --> 13:21.204
They haven't yet. And frankly,
it's a very difficult charge to prove.

13:26.918 --> 13:29.978
Man, that jury's gonna
fall in love with you.

13:30.087 --> 13:34.581
- What do you need, Michael?
- I don't need anything.

13:34.692 --> 13:37.661
I'm great,
'cause everyone else is great.

13:37.762 --> 13:41.755
I can't tell you how nice it is
to not be needed anymore.

13:41.866 --> 13:44.426
<i>I want you.</i>

13:46.003 --> 13:50.064
Okay, the jury might actually like that.

13:50.174 --> 13:54.270
<i>It was at that moment that Gob
found something thejury might not like.</i>

13:55.346 --> 13:57.541
Hammer. Oops.

14:07.525 --> 14:09.959
<i>And Lindsay arrived
at what she thought was a date.</i>

14:10.061 --> 14:11.961
<i>Hey! You found it.</i>

14:12.063 --> 14:14.554
So, shall we start in the kitchen?

14:14.665 --> 14:17.361
- I thought the bedroom.
- Sure.

14:17.468 --> 14:20.403
I'll meet you up there.
I gotta make this place smell like cookies.

14:20.504 --> 14:24.907
And you should know,
I am anticipating multiples on this.

14:25.009 --> 14:28.706
Well, I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't think that was a possibility.

14:33.184 --> 14:36.745
<i>Lindsay was nervous
and took a shower to relax.</i>

14:36.854 --> 14:40.290
I can't do this. I'm not ready for this.

14:42.026 --> 14:44.790
<i>Come on, kids. We'll go downstairs
and have some cookies.</i>

14:44.896 --> 14:47.091
<i>The kids were in for some bad news too.</i>

14:47.198 --> 14:50.929
<i>Tobias, meanwhile, discovered that
what he thought was a support group...</i>

14:51.035 --> 14:54.163
<i>turned out to be a team
ofbald men painted blue.</i>

14:55.773 --> 14:58.367
<i>Even Lucille was about
to find herself in trouble.</i>

14:58.476 --> 15:00.569
Oh, you've done this before.

15:00.678 --> 15:03.146
You know, you should let
your hair grow long.

15:03.247 --> 15:06.444
Yeah? I've thought about it.
I guess I'd look like you.

15:06.550 --> 15:09.576
More than you'll ever know.

15:12.423 --> 15:14.721
Are you living in one
of Saddam's many palaces?

15:14.825 --> 15:17.293
They may have been built
by the same developer.

15:17.395 --> 15:21.525
<i>And a seal attack.
Meet one surprised bather, coming up.</i>

15:24.869 --> 15:28.270
<i>Seven minutes had passed
since Gob had discovered the document.</i>

15:28.372 --> 15:31.136
Gob, your mother on line one.

15:32.343 --> 15:35.107
I'm coming over.
Don't talk to anyone.

15:35.212 --> 15:38.704
<i>It was at that moment that Lucille
was stopped by a documentary filmmaker.</i>

15:38.816 --> 15:43.082
Uh, your company's being accused of
profiting off the building of houses in Iraq.

15:43.187 --> 15:45.621
That's crazy.
We're all loyal Americans.

15:45.723 --> 15:49.250
Oh, yeah. Would you enlist
your son or daughter in the army?

15:51.996 --> 15:54.464
Yes.

15:57.134 --> 16:00.626
<i>Michael was out of options...</i>

16:00.738 --> 16:05.141
<i>and, knowing that his father had a penchant
for hiding valuable things in walls...</i>

16:05.242 --> 16:08.405
<i>considered one last desperate gambit.</i>

16:08.512 --> 16:12.312
This is crazy. What am I doing?
Using a hammer to try to-

16:17.254 --> 16:19.848
- Are you crazy?
- Are you blue?

16:19.957 --> 16:23.358
Only in color, Michael.
Only in color.

16:23.461 --> 16:26.328
It seems I might have stumbled
upon an acting opportunity.

16:26.430 --> 16:28.660
As a member of the Blue Man Group?

16:28.766 --> 16:30.666
Oh, no, you're thinking
of the support group.

16:30.768 --> 16:34.499
I made that same mistake myself.
They're called the Blue Man Group.

16:34.605 --> 16:37.369
But it's funny. If I hadn't
sought out a support group...

16:37.475 --> 16:42.208
I never would've gotten this gig
as an understudy for a performance art group.

16:44.015 --> 16:46.950
You know, the universe works
in mysterious ways, Michael.

16:47.051 --> 16:51.511
You never know where help is going
to come from until you look for it.

16:51.622 --> 16:54.682
Why does everybody think
that I need help?

16:54.792 --> 16:57.761
Michael, look at you.

16:57.862 --> 17:02.231
I mean, you're holding a sledgehammer,
your shirt is cov- Oh, I did that.

17:02.333 --> 17:05.733
Um, here, let me, uh-Well-

17:05.836 --> 17:08.896
<i>And Michael realized
that he, too, had been too proud.</i>

17:09.006 --> 17:11.372
- I need money.
- I can't help you.

17:11.474 --> 17:16.002
I know. It did bother me
that they did so well without me.

17:16.113 --> 17:18.411
But l-I do have to ask them for help.

17:18.516 --> 17:20.780
And I have to ask for an audition.

17:20.885 --> 17:23.251
You haven't auditioned yet?

17:23.354 --> 17:25.685
Oh, no, no.
I'm not in the group yet.

17:25.790 --> 17:28.884
No, I'm afraid I just "blue" myself.

17:30.361 --> 17:33.125
There's gotta be
a better way to say that.

17:34.665 --> 17:37.099
<i>Tobias rushed to the theater,
hoping to be seen.</i>

17:37.201 --> 17:39.465
<i>Unfortunately, it was dusk,
and he couldn't be seen.</i>

17:39.570 --> 17:42.835
What the hell was that?

17:42.940 --> 17:47.240
<i>So, for the second time in two days,
the family gathered at the hospital.</i>

17:47.344 --> 17:49.904
Everything's gonna be okay.
I'm sure he's gonna be fine.

17:50.014 --> 17:53.745
I'm so sorry that this happened.
I spoke to him just before he left the house.

17:53.851 --> 17:57.582
- Oh, really? What was the last thing he said?
- I just "blue" myself.

17:57.688 --> 18:01.454
He said some wonderful things...

18:01.559 --> 18:04.926
including the fact
that sometimes people...

18:05.029 --> 18:07.759
are too proud to ask for help
when they need it.

18:07.865 --> 18:11.995
- Oh, God! Fine. I need you!
- I need you, okay, Michael?
- No, l-I didn't mean for-

18:12.103 --> 18:14.867
He was a Realtor, Michael.
Now my husband's in the hospital.

18:14.972 --> 18:20.000
Mom volunteered me for the army
just because the fat man dared her to.

18:20.111 --> 18:24.275
- We can't let them take Buster.
- I lost my wig, my Uncle Sam wig.

18:24.381 --> 18:27.373
<i>Michael, I am sitting on
some very hot information here.</i>

18:27.485 --> 18:30.545
I know too much.
I've got the thingy.

18:30.654 --> 18:33.680
Half in English, half in scribbly.

18:33.791 --> 18:37.022
Michael, please, we need you!

18:38.596 --> 18:41.258
Well, I hate to cancel
my medical follow-up in Phoenix...

18:41.365 --> 18:44.357
but you give me the corporate checkbook,
I'll see what I can do.

18:44.468 --> 18:46.698
Excuse me. Mrs. Fünke.

18:46.804 --> 18:49.864
- Oh, this guy again.
- How is he, Doctor?

18:49.974 --> 18:52.340
It, uh, looks like he's dead.

18:52.443 --> 18:54.741
<i>- Oh, my God!
- Oh, little guy!</i>

18:54.845 --> 18:58.281
- The tears aren't coming!
The tears just aren't coming!
- Okay, okay.

18:58.382 --> 19:00.475
<i>Uh, just to be clear-</i>

19:00.584 --> 19:03.018
Looks like he's dead, or he is dead?

19:03.120 --> 19:05.088
It just looks like he's dead.

19:05.189 --> 19:08.022
He's got, like, blue paint on him
or something, but he's going to be fine.

19:08.125 --> 19:10.593
- What is wrong with you?
- What a- doctor!

19:10.694 --> 19:14.858
- I'll let you celebrate privately.
- Hey, we want this comped!

19:14.965 --> 19:17.433
Well, I'm gonna-
I'm just gonna head out.

19:17.535 --> 19:21.494
You don't need some, uh, piece of-
uncle hanging around.

19:21.605 --> 19:24.733
Hey, hey! That's not my dad. That's not the guy
you want. If you want anybody, it's me.

19:24.842 --> 19:26.503
<i>- What?
- Michael?</i>

19:26.610 --> 19:29.238
<i>Yeah. I gotta turn myself in
or make bail...</i>

19:29.346 --> 19:31.314
uh, maybe by, like, 8:00.

19:31.415 --> 19:33.679
Hey, hey, hey. That's enough.

19:33.784 --> 19:36.912
Whoa, hey. You might want
to have that looked at.

19:37.021 --> 19:40.184
Thanks, Mikey.

19:41.859 --> 19:44.089
They think I'm involved
in this Iraq thing...

19:44.195 --> 19:46.663
and I can't prove that I'm not
with Dad not around...

19:46.764 --> 19:49.460
so I need your help
or I'm gonna go to jail.

19:49.567 --> 19:54.402
We've got the proof, Michael.
Dad signed a contract with Saddam.

19:55.739 --> 19:57.707
Hussein.

19:59.343 --> 20:01.038
Use it.

20:01.145 --> 20:04.876
<i>If it makes your father look bad,
then so be it. He's long gone now.</i>

20:04.982 --> 20:08.713
- Hey, uh, where's the briefcase?
- Oscar has it.

20:08.819 --> 20:11.253
Hey, I'm awfully sorry I'm late.

20:11.355 --> 20:14.916
I got here as fast as l-
Oh, how is he?

20:15.025 --> 20:16.993
Did you just change your clothes?

20:17.094 --> 20:19.722
Hey, look what I found on windowsill.

20:19.830 --> 20:22.230
<i>Just hat. Someone take wig.</i>

20:22.333 --> 20:25.769
<i>In fact, it was George Sr. Who took wig...</i>

20:25.869 --> 20:28.633
<i>- Hit it!
- and was fleeing the country with the evidence...</i>

20:28.739 --> 20:30.764
<i>Michael so badly needed.</i>

20:32.876 --> 20:34.844
You made a huge mistake.

20:37.248 --> 20:39.375
<i>On the next Arrested Development.</i>

20:39.483 --> 20:44.182
<i>- Lindsay almost stumbles
upon a dating opportunity.
- You look really hot.</i>

20:44.288 --> 20:49.248
<i>But instead, is admitted to the hospital
with a fever of 104.</i>

20:50.728 --> 20:53.356
<i>Michael finally gets
the corporate checkbook...</i>

20:54.999 --> 20:58.264
<i>only to find that the family
has gotten to it first.</i>

20:58.369 --> 21:00.428
<i>And Barry lands in jail.</i>

21:00.537 --> 21:02.596
You're glad Tobias is pressing charges?

21:02.706 --> 21:06.198
I am having the time of my life.

21:06.310 --> 21:08.574
<i>- Hey.
- Hey, Dr. Hate.</i>

21:08.679 --> 21:10.647
<i>No touching!</i>
