00:00.055 --> 00:01.226
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis...

00:01.312 --> 00:03.484
<i>No matter were we try to hide
on this planet,</i>

00:03.670 --> 00:06.111
the Replicator satellite
will be able to track us.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.946
<i>Atlantis is leaving.</i>

00:08.045 --> 00:11.141
- We're not flying high enough.
- We don't have enough power.

00:14.920 --> 00:15.987
<i>We are lost.</i>

00:16.285 --> 00:19.247
We dropped out of hyperspace way
too soon. I have no idea where we are.

00:19.327 --> 00:21.424
She's unresponsive
and her pupils are sluggish.

00:21.573 --> 00:23.895
Prep the OR and have the scanner
ready when we get there.

00:24.084 --> 00:26.498
Several conduits were affected
by the brush with the beam.

00:26.580 --> 00:28.647
She's suffering from cerebral oedema,

00:28.729 --> 00:31.156
which may have caused
substantial brain damage.

00:31.236 --> 00:33.013
- What is that?
- An asteroid belt?

00:33.093 --> 00:36.411
<i>We're gonna clear a path through
the belt by firing our drones.</i>

00:36.810 --> 00:39.397
Elizabeth's crashing. If we
do this thing, we need to do it now.

00:39.494 --> 00:40.520
What did you do?

00:40.692 --> 00:42.314
- I reactivated the nanites.
- Dammit!

00:42.394 --> 00:45.422
<i>But I'm certain they're not gonna try</i>
<i>to take her over or contact the others!</i>

00:45.502 --> 00:47.068
This is a very bad idea.

00:47.191 --> 00:49.013
There's a planet out there with ZPMs?

00:49.094 --> 00:50.998
<i>That would be the Replicator homeworld.</i>

00:51.942 --> 00:53.275
You feel up to a heist?

01:08.268 --> 01:10.614
OK, when I say,
go ahead and try the left one.

01:12.123 --> 01:13.917
Geez!
I said, "when I say!"

01:13.998 --> 01:15.256
I thought you did say!

01:15.500 --> 01:16.703
How's it going, boys?

01:17.023 --> 01:18.606
We'd be making a lot more progress

01:18.688 --> 01:21.316
if Timmy Torture over here wasn't
trying to kill me every 2 sec.

01:21.396 --> 01:23.229
I'm not trying to kill him.

01:24.597 --> 01:26.996
So, can you make it
jump into hyperspace or not?

01:27.218 --> 01:28.219
Yes, I think so.

01:28.299 --> 01:29.903
<i>- You think so?</i>
- Yes, think.

01:30.089 --> 01:31.613
You said you could do it.

01:31.775 --> 01:33.990
Correction I said "probably" do it.

01:34.350 --> 01:37.777
Yes, he has trouble with an algorithm
he created during his near-ascension.

01:37.858 --> 01:41.081
This is unbelievably complex
physics here, alright?

01:41.163 --> 01:44.323
I mean, it makes string theory look
like non-linear dynamics.

01:45.538 --> 01:46.842
Even if I do get it working,

01:46.922 --> 01:49.707
there's still a thousand things
that could go terribly, terribly wrong.

01:49.788 --> 01:53.064
I get it, it's difficult.
Million-to-one odds...

01:53.410 --> 01:56.677
Was there something else you needed,
or were you here to prod and belittle?

01:56.757 --> 01:57.760
No, not.

01:58.338 --> 01:59.466
Not merely.

01:59.546 --> 02:02.015
There's another problem
we need to be thinking about.

02:02.096 --> 02:04.562
Such as, what do we do
when we get there?

02:05.469 --> 02:07.727
<i>Getting this thing to jump
into hyperspace may be easy.</i>

02:07.809 --> 02:10.106
Infiltrating the city, stealing the ZPM,

02:10.187 --> 02:12.271
and getting out,
I think that's a little dicey.

02:12.367 --> 02:13.359
<i>To say the least.</i>

02:13.439 --> 02:15.094
<i>- I've been thinking about that.</i>
- And?

02:15.176 --> 02:18.058
And I think that if we stand
any chance of succeeding,

02:18.140 --> 02:19.629
we're gonna need some help.

02:19.955 --> 02:20.975
From who?

02:30.873 --> 02:32.256

03:42.746 --> 03:44.003
The nanites inside you,

03:44.097 --> 03:45.837
I think, if we got them
in close proximity

03:45.919 --> 03:47.457
to the human-form Replicator's city,

03:47.537 --> 03:49.629
I'd be able to manipulate them
to remotely hack

03:49.712 --> 03:51.242
into the Replicator mainframe.

03:51.390 --> 03:54.769
We'd be able to find out the closest ZPM
and the quickest way to get in and out.

03:54.850 --> 03:57.331
Not only that, we'd be able to track
their movement as well.

03:57.413 --> 03:59.324
We'll know they're coming
before they spot us.

03:59.404 --> 04:01.285
Which does not eliminate the danger.

04:01.559 --> 04:02.599
<i>Far from it.</i>

04:02.681 --> 04:04.422
<i>But it does give us a significant edge.</i>

04:04.504 --> 04:07.749
What happens if the Replicators take
control of the nanites inside me?

04:07.829 --> 04:10.039
- They won't. I'd block any attempt...
<i>- But if they do?</i>

04:10.119 --> 04:12.608
I ordered Rodney to write a kill switch
into the nanites' code.

04:12.689 --> 04:15.558
If we trigger the program,
it'll neutralize them.

04:18.187 --> 04:20.137
Neutralize them,
you mean shut them off?

04:20.519 --> 04:21.653
Yes.

04:21.733 --> 04:24.533
And you said the nanites are
all that are keeping me alive.

04:25.298 --> 04:26.353
<i>They are.</i>

04:26.855 --> 04:28.935
If we shut them off, it will...

04:29.880 --> 04:30.814
kill you.

04:33.620 --> 04:35.401
But that's not gonna happen.

04:35.536 --> 04:36.542
Alright?

04:36.855 --> 04:40.310
I've ordered Rodney to keep an eye
on the bastards, make sure they behave.

04:41.301 --> 04:43.048
<i>We would not ask this
of you if it was not</i>

04:43.129 --> 04:45.328
the only chance of
this mission succeeding.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.621
She's right, if we don't get hold
of a ZPM, the City and everyone in...

04:49.715 --> 04:51.007
When do we leave?

04:53.318 --> 04:54.327
Right now.

04:54.541 --> 04:55.472
<i>What? Wait,</i>

04:55.552 --> 04:58.667
No... not right now. Look, I haven't
finished finalizing the power distrib...

04:58.749 --> 05:00.611
Finalize it. We need to move.

05:10.718 --> 05:12.465
You're gonna be OK, Elizabeth.

05:13.117 --> 05:14.120
Still,

05:14.565 --> 05:17.333
I would like all of you
to keep a very close eye on me,

05:17.414 --> 05:19.521
and the first sign
of any suspicious behavior,

05:19.602 --> 05:21.698
do not hesitate
with that kill switch.

05:22.525 --> 05:25.454
- OK, but that's not gonna happen...
<i>- John, I mean it.</i>

05:33.134 --> 05:34.140
<i>Hey, Teyla!</i>

05:34.767 --> 05:35.773
Wait up.

05:38.792 --> 05:40.913
I'm gonna need you
to sit this one out.

05:41.292 --> 05:42.911
John, if this mission is not successful

05:42.992 --> 05:44.725
Zelenka thinks he found a planet

05:44.807 --> 05:46.424
that can sustain human life.

05:46.879 --> 05:49.652
He's fairly confident that he can get
the City there in one jump.

05:49.732 --> 05:51.775
Without the shields,
we will be unable to land.

05:51.857 --> 05:55.534
I know. We won't even have enough
power to establish orbit.

05:56.589 --> 05:59.712
You're gonna have to do a fly-by,
and get everybody else in the Jumper.

05:59.792 --> 06:02.267
- You mean abandon the City.
- Well, if it comes to that.

06:03.442 --> 06:05.311
Alright, these people
are gonna need a leader.

06:05.405 --> 06:08.452
Somebody who can keep them alive, keep
them together, more importantly, not

06:08.546 --> 06:09.882
let them give up hope.

06:11.168 --> 06:12.239
That's you, Teyla.

06:12.433 --> 06:14.542
Look, if I'm not back twelve hours,

06:15.375 --> 06:16.381
give the order.

06:26.061 --> 06:27.086
Alright.

06:27.713 --> 06:28.716
Now.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.125
- Are you certain?
- Yes.

06:32.369 --> 06:35.938
I only ask 'cause the last time you were
less than definitive in your answer...

06:36.524 --> 06:37.527
Alright.

06:42.329 --> 06:44.138
- OK.
- Yes?

06:45.191 --> 06:47.719
- I think we got it.
- Good, good, now...

06:48.053 --> 06:50.119
now, as long as we don't
burn up all of the power

06:50.199 --> 06:51.622
on the initial jump, then...

06:52.485 --> 06:53.899
Yes, yes, right, OK.

06:54.525 --> 06:55.531
I'll leave now.

07:00.483 --> 07:03.427
- You ready?
- Yes. I'm not sure if it's gonna work,

07:03.523 --> 07:05.168
I've done everything
I can to make it.

07:05.248 --> 07:06.714
Sheppard, we're ready.

07:25.772 --> 07:27.570
<i>Alright Teyla, we're ready to launch.</i>

07:27.650 --> 07:28.698
Understood.

07:28.953 --> 07:30.742
Open the Jumper bay doors.

07:31.542 --> 07:34.312
Remember, no wild parties
while we're gone.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.647
<i>We will try to restrain ourselves.</i>

07:37.895 --> 07:39.054
Good luck.

07:39.455 --> 07:41.330
<i>Alright, here we go.</i>

07:48.340 --> 07:49.743
Rodney, you ready?

07:52.494 --> 07:55.472
Did I mention that this might not work?
And that we could either drop out of

07:55.552 --> 07:58.588
hyperspace prematurely and end up
stranded in the middle of deep space,

07:58.675 --> 08:01.010
<i>or quite possibly, be vaporized
the moment I touch that.</i>

08:01.090 --> 08:02.636
Just answer the damn question.

08:04.007 --> 08:05.156
Yeah, I'm ready.

08:05.236 --> 08:06.454
Good, sit down.

08:11.452 --> 08:12.617
Here goes.

08:13.872 --> 08:16.988
OK, opening
hyperspace window in three,

08:17.562 --> 08:18.573
two,

08:18.860 --> 08:19.948
one...

08:29.739 --> 08:32.717
Oh my! that's... beautiful.

08:32.964 --> 08:34.044
Yeah, it is.

08:34.604 --> 08:36.231
It's like Elwynn Forest.

08:37.472 --> 08:38.621
Oh, nothing, it's

08:38.702 --> 08:40.534
one of the lands in Warcraft.

08:40.957 --> 08:42.667
That's a game I play.

08:44.225 --> 08:45.756
Well, occasionally.

08:50.506 --> 08:51.859
You gonna be OK?

08:52.132 --> 08:54.866
Yeah, I just... you know,
I don't get to get offworld much,

08:54.946 --> 08:56.410
or ever, hardly.

08:56.515 --> 08:58.798
You'd better take a picture
we're not gonna be here long.

08:58.878 --> 09:00.260
Right, good idea.

09:00.711 --> 09:02.566
This is Colonel Carter
calling the Apollo.

09:02.646 --> 09:04.158
Colonel Ellis, do you read?

09:04.238 --> 09:05.688
<i>Five by five, Colonel.</i>

09:06.071 --> 09:08.831
We've stepped through the Gate
and are ready for transport.

09:08.911 --> 09:11.070
- No, wait...
<i>- Stand-by.</i>

09:19.225 --> 09:21.411
Welcome to the Pegasus galaxy, Colonel.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.856
Thank you.
Still no word from Atlantis?

09:25.283 --> 09:26.390
Nothing.

09:26.991 --> 09:28.545
<i>I've been going over the specs</i>

09:28.625 --> 09:31.547
for these modifications you're proposing
for the sensor array.

09:31.627 --> 09:35.411
You're asking for a five-fold increase
in power consumption?

09:35.494 --> 09:38.916
Plus, you want to cannibalize parts
from half a dozen other key

09:38.996 --> 09:41.505
<i>systems, including
subspace communications.</i>

09:41.879 --> 09:42.931
That's correct.

09:43.181 --> 09:44.722
What if they try and contact us?

09:45.515 --> 09:47.644
If they could, they would have done it.

09:47.808 --> 09:49.482
All of this is based on the assumption

09:49.562 --> 09:51.567
that they dropped out
of hyperspace early.

09:51.818 --> 09:54.757
Yeah, we believe
that's the most likely scenario.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.706
Alright, let's do it.

10:11.934 --> 10:13.414
<i>Congratulations, Rodney.</i>

10:13.494 --> 10:14.937
Your hyperdrive worked.

10:15.060 --> 10:16.960
Unfortunately, believe it or not,

10:17.040 --> 10:18.806
Zelenka was actually right.

10:19.134 --> 10:20.925
We burned up way more power on the jump

10:21.005 --> 10:22.223
<i>than we expected.</i>

10:22.496 --> 10:24.335
What are you saying?
We can't get back?

10:24.415 --> 10:26.701
No, what I am saying is that the...

10:27.712 --> 10:29.918
Actually,
that's exactly what I'm saying.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.571
I suppose, once we steal the ZPM,
I could utilise its power.

10:32.659 --> 10:36.182
- Need to make sure I don't overload...
- Let's take this one step at a time!

10:36.356 --> 10:37.484
First things first.

10:37.564 --> 10:39.472
Let's worry about getting the ZPM.

10:39.964 --> 10:40.977
Right.

10:42.780 --> 10:45.828
- I'm gonna try to initialize the link.
- What do you want me to do?

10:45.908 --> 10:48.110
Nothing. Just sit there.
It's completely wireless.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.408
Let me know if anything
pops into your mind.

10:50.733 --> 10:51.943
What do you mean?

10:52.023 --> 10:53.890
Will I just sort of sense something,

10:53.970 --> 10:55.280
or is it more of a...

10:57.334 --> 10:58.334
Oh, my God.

11:01.976 --> 11:02.748
<i>I did it.</i>

11:02.828 --> 11:04.586
I mean, she did it.

11:06.698 --> 11:09.634
<i>But we have to move fast. Even though
her nanites are in lurking mode,</i>

11:09.714 --> 11:12.888
won't take long for them to figure out
another player has joined the game.

11:12.970 --> 11:14.617
How you feeling, Elizabeth?

11:14.697 --> 11:15.882
Very strange.

11:16.834 --> 11:19.659
<i>I can suddenly see the entire city
directly in front of me.</i>

11:19.739 --> 11:22.358
Every corridor, every single room...

11:27.591 --> 11:28.602
That way.

11:28.903 --> 11:29.956
The ZPM.

11:31.385 --> 11:35.308
Fourth quadrant, top level, easy access.
There's hardly anyone around.

11:36.442 --> 11:37.918
Alright, works for me.

11:52.172 --> 11:54.760
Alright, we're down.
Rodney, stay here with Elizabeth,

11:54.840 --> 11:57.858
keep sifting through the intel.
You guys can guide us through by radio.

11:59.772 --> 12:01.980
<i>Twenty meters to the left
behind the jumper,</i>

12:02.060 --> 12:03.387
<i>there's an access door.</i>

12:03.467 --> 12:04.764
Down one flight of stairs,

12:04.844 --> 12:06.592
you'll enter auxiliary corridor seven.

12:08.820 --> 12:09.900
Go now, it's clear.

12:26.767 --> 12:28.379
We're at the corridor.

12:28.461 --> 12:29.630
<i>Go right.</i>

12:29.710 --> 12:30.883
<i>At 6.5 meters,</i>

12:30.963 --> 12:33.443
<i>- there should be another corridor.</i>
- OK, we see it.

12:33.523 --> 12:35.087
<i>Turn left. Wait! Go back!</i>

12:38.531 --> 12:40.389
It's alright, he didn't see you.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.152
Really? You know that?

12:43.846 --> 12:46.255
Yeah. Like I said, it's very strange.

12:48.053 --> 12:49.208
Can we go now?

12:49.775 --> 12:50.813
<i>Yes, go.</i>

12:54.596 --> 12:56.044
<i>Turn left, then right.</i>

13:06.306 --> 13:08.191
It should be directly in front of you.

13:08.271 --> 13:09.620
<i>Yeah, I see it.</i>

13:11.048 --> 13:12.268
Hold up, Chewie.

13:16.111 --> 13:18.736
Aren't they gonna notice
when we pull the plug on this thing?

13:18.816 --> 13:20.567
<i>Probably,
but they've got dozens of ZPMs.</i>

13:20.647 --> 13:23.432
Let's just hope that they don't notice
until we're long gone.

13:23.585 --> 13:25.120
<i>That's wishful thinking.</i>

13:25.243 --> 13:26.511
<i>We still in the clear?</i>

13:26.917 --> 13:29.829
There's a small group of Replicators
two corridors over, heading your way,

13:29.909 --> 13:31.518
<i>so you need to move quickly.</i>

13:38.762 --> 13:39.787
Got it.

13:40.484 --> 13:41.765
We're on our way.

13:54.949 --> 13:56.385
Hook up the ZPM, we're leaving.

13:56.465 --> 13:58.880
- Wait a minute. We can't go.
- What are you talking about?

13:58.999 --> 14:01.012
You said you could get
the hyperdrive back online.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.913
I mean, we can, but not yet. Look,
while Elizabeth's been connected,

14:04.015 --> 14:07.331
I've been going over the Replicator's
base code, and I found this.

14:09.188 --> 14:10.266
What is that?

14:11.978 --> 14:13.078
The Holy Grail.

14:13.180 --> 14:15.030
It's their whole reason for being.

14:15.364 --> 14:17.937
It's a command code
that directs them to attack the Wraith.

14:18.017 --> 14:19.646
But they don't attack the Wraith.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.692
They've been sitting on their nanite
asses for 10,000 years.

14:22.772 --> 14:24.360
That's because it's been deactivated.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.331
- And how did that happen?
- I've no idea.

14:26.427 --> 14:29.184
Maybe the Ancients did it when
they realised they'd lost control.

14:29.282 --> 14:31.141
You're just noticing this now, huh?

14:31.562 --> 14:34.954
<i>This is just one in millions
of commands in the base code.</i>

14:35.034 --> 14:37.801
Look, I always had a hunch that
something like this might be in there,

14:37.881 --> 14:39.703
but believe me, it was not easy to find.

14:39.956 --> 14:41.107
Can you reactivate it?

14:41.203 --> 14:43.653
Yes, but there's a problem.

14:43.763 --> 14:45.675
Look, I can reprogram
the nanites in your brain

14:45.767 --> 14:47.610
and use that link
to upload the changes, but

14:47.721 --> 14:50.988
we'll need to wait for the next merge to
affect all the Replicators at once, and

14:51.144 --> 14:53.284
we have no idea when that could be.
Not only that, but

14:53.404 --> 14:55.386
the instant it happens,
they'll know you're there.

14:55.466 --> 14:57.351
<i>They'll take immediate
steps to assimilate you.</i>

14:57.431 --> 14:59.002
Then we're not doing it.

14:59.446 --> 15:01.798
John...
You know what this could mean.

15:02.248 --> 15:04.192
If the Replicators go to war
with the Wraith?

15:04.272 --> 15:05.902
Forget about it. It's not happening.

15:05.982 --> 15:08.306
- That's not your call.
- The hell it isn't!

15:09.677 --> 15:11.236
Hang on. There may be another way.

15:11.376 --> 15:13.065
There's a central data core.

15:14.241 --> 15:18.280
It's kind of like a back-up
hard-drive for all the Replicators.

15:18.391 --> 15:21.410
<i>If I can upload the reactivated
attack command directly into that,</i>

15:21.563 --> 15:24.390
we wouldn't need to use Elizabeth.
We could be half way back to Atlantis

15:24.470 --> 15:26.631
when the attack command
takes effect at the next merge.

15:26.817 --> 15:28.549
That sounds a little more like it.

15:28.766 --> 15:31.267
There's one small problem,

15:31.891 --> 15:33.952
which is not actually a small problem.

15:34.032 --> 15:37.239
The core is at the center of the city,
several levels down.

15:37.319 --> 15:39.579
It would be impossible
to get there undetected.

15:39.834 --> 15:40.834
Great.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.030
We're gonna have to come back
after we take the ZPM back to Atlantis

15:44.139 --> 15:45.521
and after we land the City.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.333
<i>I don't think we'll have another chance.</i>

15:47.429 --> 15:48.451
<i>He's right.</i>

15:48.809 --> 15:50.498
Once they notice the ZPM is missing,

15:50.596 --> 15:53.277
they'll be able to trace
the source of the infiltration.

15:53.357 --> 15:56.118
I will never get this kind
of undetected access again.

15:56.435 --> 15:58.787
If we're gonna do this,
it's now or never.

16:02.387 --> 16:05.046
You're gonna turn the cloak
in an anti-Replicator field?

16:05.126 --> 16:07.131
Yes, by interfacing
the A.R.G's control crystal

16:07.211 --> 16:08.958
with the Jumper's cloaking generator.

16:09.038 --> 16:11.724
The only question is how far
I can widen the field.

16:11.914 --> 16:15.585
Look, go ahead and fly us as close
to the center of the city as possible.

16:15.666 --> 16:16.634
There.

16:16.714 --> 16:19.350
<i>- But won't we be visible?</i>
- Yes, we will.

16:19.705 --> 16:21.484
The anti-Replicator field
will protect us.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.020
That is, assuming that I can
extend the field wide enough

16:24.109 --> 16:26.859
to encompass not only the Jumper,
but also the core room, and

16:26.939 --> 16:29.849
also assuming we can run fast enough
to get there, input the command, and

16:29.983 --> 16:33.874
get back before the Replicators figure
out how to override the field, and...

16:33.954 --> 16:35.433
You know, slaughter us.

16:36.083 --> 16:38.060
Don't worry about it.
You're not coming with us.

16:38.277 --> 16:40.062
<i>- Neither is Elizabeth.</i>
- I'm sorry, what?

16:40.142 --> 16:43.256
You guys can guide us through
by radio like you did last time.

16:44.061 --> 16:47.285
Wait a minute. If I'm not there, how are
we supposed to input the command?

16:47.387 --> 16:50.628
Put it on a tablet. I'll plug it
into the core and upload it myself.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.981
Oh, plug and play, huh?
What, you think it's that simple?

16:53.070 --> 16:55.578
Well, it will be, because
you're gonna make it that simple.

16:56.042 --> 16:57.413
- Yeah...
<i>- I need you</i>

16:57.829 --> 16:59.373
to stay here, Rodney.

16:59.584 --> 17:00.750
- Why?
- Rodney!

17:00.835 --> 17:02.293
To keep an eye on me.

17:02.975 --> 17:05.176
You may need to activate
the kill switch on the nanites.

17:05.271 --> 17:08.670
You'll be able to keep a closer eye on
me if we both stay here in the Jumper.

17:13.248 --> 17:14.248
Alright.

17:15.001 --> 17:16.473
Get out of that.

17:19.156 --> 17:22.348
- The core is beneath that platform.
- How far beneath?

17:23.422 --> 17:24.521
Nine levels.

17:26.364 --> 17:27.443
Piece of cake.

17:44.414 --> 17:46.587
- Anything?
- No.

17:48.859 --> 17:49.948
<i>Eleven jumps.</i>

17:50.899 --> 17:53.564
I'm sorry. Even with the scanners' range
significantly increased,

17:53.675 --> 17:55.429
we've only covered a small area so far.

17:56.377 --> 17:59.914
<i>We still have 39 more jumps before
we reach the original Lantian planet.</i>

18:00.025 --> 18:00.892
Thirty nine?

18:02.349 --> 18:04.779
Space is quite vast.

18:06.728 --> 18:07.895
You don't say.

18:10.982 --> 18:12.357
Engage hyperdrive.

18:13.737 --> 18:15.137
<i>Stop number twelve.</i>

18:29.045 --> 18:32.782
- We're visible.
- Engaging anti-Replicator field now.

18:43.686 --> 18:44.897
It's working.

18:45.146 --> 18:48.557
OK, let's jack it up,
see how far we can penetrate.

18:49.395 --> 18:50.395
Penetrate?

18:50.899 --> 18:51.899
What?

18:54.076 --> 18:55.559
Alright, here we go.

19:07.552 --> 19:09.665
- It's working.
- Damn right, it's working.

19:09.786 --> 19:12.275
It's encompassed the core room.
You're good to go.

19:17.401 --> 19:19.623
What, you don't believe me,
but you believe her?

19:19.738 --> 19:20.849
No offense.

19:21.634 --> 19:22.834
Offense taken.

19:23.359 --> 19:25.314
Straight down, nine levels.

19:25.900 --> 19:28.463
Then a short run down a corridor
to the core room.

19:31.416 --> 19:34.400
OK, I've written a basic
block-storage transport protocol

19:34.507 --> 19:38.214
to upload the attack command
directly from this tablet into the core.

19:38.384 --> 19:41.365
All you need to do is plug
this cable into the main circuit,

19:41.498 --> 19:44.160
it'll automatically configure
and upload the command.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.328
Plug it in.

19:45.703 --> 19:47.652
- You wanted simple.
- I like simple.

19:48.095 --> 19:50.960
Well, we created that adapter
to interface with Ancient tech,

19:51.275 --> 19:54.848
which the Replicators love to imitate,
so you shouldn't have a problem there.

19:54.959 --> 19:57.312
Now, you need to move fast,
because as soon as they find out

19:57.423 --> 19:59.927
what we're up to, they're going
to figure out a way around it.

20:00.007 --> 20:01.856
Just do what you did last time.

20:02.457 --> 20:03.973
We'll be back before you know it.

20:04.651 --> 20:05.651
<i>Let's go.</i>

20:25.516 --> 20:26.716
What is it?

20:26.934 --> 20:29.937
An anomalous energy reading in the 2nd
quadrant of the communications tower.

20:30.049 --> 20:31.982
- Source?
- Undetermined as of yet.

20:32.090 --> 20:35.360
It's creating a disruptive field,
emanating downwards from the top level,

20:35.493 --> 20:38.049
<i>encompassing nine levels
directly below it.</i>

20:38.397 --> 20:39.464
The core.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.800
<i>OK, we're here. Left or right?</i>

20:43.137 --> 20:44.179
Left.

20:56.279 --> 20:57.734
Shield's working, Rodney.

20:57.814 --> 21:01.020
- Good, make sure to stay behind it.
<i>- Thanks for the tip.</i>

21:01.682 --> 21:02.948
Now turn right.

21:22.637 --> 21:23.977
Alright, we're here.

21:24.097 --> 21:26.638
I'm assuming the big
glowy thing is the core.

21:27.505 --> 21:29.574
Indeed, it is. OK,
there should be an open slot

21:29.694 --> 21:31.852
in the control panel
that you can plug the cable into.

21:33.433 --> 21:34.523
Alright.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.143
Here goes.

21:42.663 --> 21:43.763
It's plugged in.

21:43.883 --> 21:44.872
It is?

21:45.195 --> 21:48.535
Why am I not reading anything? Are you
sure you plugged it into the right slot?

21:49.936 --> 21:51.705
There's only one slot, Rodney.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.722
Hurry, John, they're coming,
and there's hundreds of them.

21:57.040 --> 22:00.004
- Won't the field protect us?
<i>- As long as you hurry.</i>

22:00.680 --> 22:03.091
OK, look, try plugging it in again.

22:05.676 --> 22:07.470
Alright, it's plugged in again.

22:09.265 --> 22:11.162
Still nothing. What did you do?

22:11.282 --> 22:12.525
I didn't do anything.

22:19.939 --> 22:21.609
They keep attacking the field.

22:22.407 --> 22:24.529
<i>They're deliberately
sacrificing themselves.</i>

22:24.768 --> 22:25.947
Why would they do that?

22:27.084 --> 22:28.283
The more they attack the field,

22:28.365 --> 22:30.952
the quicker they can figure out
how to override it.

22:31.111 --> 22:32.983
Then we need to get the hell ot of here.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.624
Rodney, why is this not working?

22:34.928 --> 22:37.713
<i>It's not working because
the core is not recognizing the tablet.</i>

22:37.833 --> 22:38.940
Why not?

22:39.060 --> 22:40.341
I don't know!

22:47.131 --> 22:49.158
<i>- We're almost through the field.</i>
- Good.

22:49.375 --> 22:50.488
I'm on my way.

22:52.878 --> 22:55.574
You need to implement
adjustments in the negotiation protocol

22:55.654 --> 22:58.020
to exploit parallelism
at the device interface.

22:58.736 --> 23:00.434
- What?
<i>- Just do what I say.</i>

23:00.554 --> 23:04.097
<i>Start by unplugging the cable. 
Access the tablet's root directory.</i>

23:04.934 --> 23:06.403
This is not simple.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.474
- You have to get them out of there.
- We're not done...

23:18.554 --> 23:21.600
There's no more time!
The Replicators have breached the field!

23:24.594 --> 23:26.381
What do you mean
they breached the field?

23:26.501 --> 23:29.544
<i>They figured how to override it.
Look, we need to move much faster.</i>

23:29.640 --> 23:31.822
<i>You need to make changes
to the negotiation protocol</i>

23:31.942 --> 23:33.991
<i>to allow for direct data placement.</i>

23:34.111 --> 23:36.619
We need to allow for resynchronization
of the packet boundaries

23:36.739 --> 23:38.224
within the data stream.

23:38.344 --> 23:40.424
Oberoth is heading to the core room.

23:40.666 --> 23:42.563
- He knows it's us.
- How far is he?

23:42.645 --> 23:44.193
- Can they make a run for it?
- No.

23:44.273 --> 23:46.958
Replicators are apoaching
from every direction. They're trapped.

23:47.038 --> 23:48.859
Which means they're as good as dead.

23:49.183 --> 23:50.716
We can hear you, you know.

23:50.836 --> 23:52.008
What? No.

23:52.128 --> 23:54.775
When I say, "as good as dead,"
I mean it as more of a...

23:54.895 --> 23:56.855
- Elizabeth, what are you doing?
- Stay here!

23:56.975 --> 23:58.724
Elizabeth, you can't go out there!

23:58.844 --> 24:00.308
<i>- Elizabeth!</i>
- What's going on?

24:00.404 --> 24:02.539
<i>- Elizabeth just left the jumper.</i>
- Why?

24:02.731 --> 24:04.590
I don't know. She just ran out.

24:04.710 --> 24:07.105
<i>Elizabeth, this is Sheppard,
do you copy?</i>

24:10.607 --> 24:11.632
Respond.

24:12.238 --> 24:14.530
- If they capture her...
- I know, I know.

24:14.773 --> 24:16.243
<i>So, what do we do now?</i>

24:17.529 --> 24:20.767
She said to hit the kill switch on the
nanites if she did anything suspicious.

24:21.717 --> 24:22.717
I know, but...

24:26.818 --> 24:27.628
Sheppard.

24:30.081 --> 24:31.401
Make the call.

24:33.914 --> 24:34.916
Do it.

24:46.163 --> 24:48.482
- It's not working.
- What?

24:48.602 --> 24:51.246
- Why not?
<i>- Just... give me a second.</i>

24:53.938 --> 24:57.985
I'm not getting confirmation, and don't
ask why, because I don't know, OK?

24:58.078 --> 24:59.992
The last time she had
active nanites inside her,

25:00.112 --> 25:03.375
she was able to exert a certain control.
Maybe she's doing it here now, or...

25:03.455 --> 25:05.751
maybe there's interference
that's affecting the frequency.

25:05.831 --> 25:08.491
<i>I don't know.
I need to run a diagnostic.</i>

25:08.611 --> 25:11.274
Better yet, why don't you figure out
a way how to get us out here?

25:11.883 --> 25:14.755
If we're screwed, we might
as well complete the mission.

25:30.537 --> 25:31.584
Dr. Weir?

25:32.192 --> 25:33.372
Hello, Oberoth.

25:34.584 --> 25:35.876
You're surprised.

25:36.065 --> 25:37.156
Indeed, I am.

25:38.526 --> 25:40.418
Niam infected me with nanites.

25:41.349 --> 25:43.147
Yes, I can detect them now.

25:43.267 --> 25:44.955
We were able to neutralize them,

25:45.876 --> 25:47.212
and then reprogram

25:48.254 --> 25:50.730
and manipulate them to suit our needs.

25:51.871 --> 25:53.149
Industrious of you.

25:53.388 --> 25:57.509
Which is why, now that I've been able to
establish a physical link through you,

25:59.284 --> 26:02.445
I have direct access
to the Replicator collective.

26:05.189 --> 26:06.614
I'm in control now.

26:11.914 --> 26:13.377
OK, I'm plugged in. Anything?

26:17.598 --> 26:19.675
Yes! Yes, it's working!

26:36.358 --> 26:38.110
What the hell just happened?

26:40.294 --> 26:42.053
The Replicators have all frozen.

26:42.173 --> 26:44.700
Well, I can see that, but who did it?

26:44.921 --> 26:46.167
<i>It wasn't me.</i>

26:46.759 --> 26:48.096
It might have been Elizabeth.

26:48.187 --> 26:50.053
<i>- Can she do that?</i>
- I don't know. I mean,

26:50.166 --> 26:52.998
<i>she'd have to link directly
with the collective, which means the</i>

26:53.078 --> 26:56.490
<i>chances they'll be able to take over her
nanites have increased exponentially.</i>

26:56.570 --> 26:58.419
How long before they come back to life?

26:58.499 --> 27:01.298
<i>Your guess is as good as mine,
but I would err on the side of less time</i>

27:01.378 --> 27:03.302
<i>- rather than more.</i>
- So we go?

27:03.664 --> 27:06.055
Yeah, first things first. How are we
doing with the upload?

27:07.428 --> 27:09.037
Almost there. Just a few more seconds.

27:09.157 --> 27:11.858
<i>- How many seconds?</i>
Don't start with that again!

27:14.950 --> 27:16.754
I'm impressed with your strength,

27:17.664 --> 27:20.575
Dr. Weir, but I must remind you,
that it's only a matter of time

27:21.088 --> 27:23.700
before I make the necessary corrections

27:23.809 --> 27:26.320
to overcome the hold you have on me.

27:26.830 --> 27:28.994
I am prepared to fight
for as long as I need.

27:29.671 --> 27:30.761
Good for you.

27:31.653 --> 27:34.815
Your desire to protect
your people is admirable,

27:36.275 --> 27:37.888
but you will, ultimately,

27:38.813 --> 27:39.610
fail.

27:39.730 --> 27:40.936
Keep thinking that.

27:41.973 --> 27:44.509
Keep allowing your arrogance
to undermine you.

27:44.726 --> 27:46.953
You know it's true, Dr. Weir.

27:49.697 --> 27:51.589
I can feel you weakening already.

27:54.968 --> 27:56.214
Despite your desire

27:57.012 --> 27:59.500
this is a fight for which you are...

27:59.923 --> 28:00.976
clearly

28:01.387 --> 28:02.652
ill-equipped.

28:02.732 --> 28:04.321
<i>That's it, you're done! Unplug and go!</i>

28:24.204 --> 28:25.526
Once again,

28:26.062 --> 28:27.798
you have underestimated me.

28:35.233 --> 28:36.770
<i>They're moving again!</i>

28:39.866 --> 28:41.901
Yeah. I know.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.511
Well,

29:13.949 --> 29:15.143
this is familiar.

29:15.493 --> 29:17.871
I'm trying to decide
if this incursion of yours

29:17.981 --> 29:20.439
reflects considerable bravery or

29:20.519 --> 29:22.441
- stupidity.
- Where's Dr. Weir?

29:23.279 --> 29:25.165
Her attempts to seize
control of the collective

29:25.275 --> 29:27.280
proved too taxing for her,

29:27.626 --> 29:30.551
<i>rendering her mind and body
virtually moribund.</i>

29:31.030 --> 29:32.724
She has been taken to be...

29:33.039 --> 29:34.269
repaired.

29:34.528 --> 29:37.480
- You're gonna take control of her.
- That has already occurred.

29:38.692 --> 29:40.793
Unfortunately, I was not able to

29:40.873 --> 29:43.599
glean all the information
I need from her,

29:43.736 --> 29:46.006
so I will have to extract it from you.

29:46.305 --> 29:47.644
Information?

29:47.767 --> 29:49.802
About the precise location of Atlantis.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.805
You left your planet before
we were able to destroy it.

29:53.130 --> 29:55.043
Sorry to spoil your plans.

29:55.153 --> 29:56.616
Nothing is spoiled,

29:56.830 --> 29:58.963
merely prolonged,

29:59.291 --> 30:00.780
and now, with your help,

30:00.931 --> 30:02.690
we will complete the destruction.

30:03.668 --> 30:06.694
Seeing how none of us
will volunteer the information...

30:07.290 --> 30:09.286
You know quite well

30:09.654 --> 30:12.757
that we have a simple method
for extracting what we need.

30:41.892 --> 30:43.026
Problems?

31:03.079 --> 31:04.126
What?

31:04.263 --> 31:06.586
I figured, you'd messed with our minds,

31:07.488 --> 31:09.214
so I'd mess with yours.

31:09.634 --> 31:11.835
You didn't overpower me, Oberoth.

31:12.204 --> 31:15.033
The Replicator guards
didn't capture my team.

31:17.218 --> 31:20.389
It was all a fictional scenario
played out in your mind.

31:21.428 --> 31:23.574
In reality,
your guards are still frozen,

31:23.684 --> 31:27.005
and my team is escaping as we speak.

31:28.229 --> 31:29.889
You were wrong, Oberoth.

31:30.627 --> 31:32.828
I have never underestimated you,

31:34.304 --> 31:36.783
but you have clearly underestimated me.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.361
You will not leave this city alive!

31:39.498 --> 31:40.578
<i>Maybe not,</i>

31:42.009 --> 31:43.581
but my team will.

31:44.162 --> 31:46.192
- Still nothing from Elizabeth?
- <i>No.</i>

31:46.300 --> 31:49.533
<i>Can't communicate with her or track her.
It's like she just... disappeared.</i>

31:49.615 --> 31:51.378
If she's the one
who froze the Replicators,

31:51.460 --> 31:53.271
that means she's probably still alive.

31:53.353 --> 31:54.877
<i>For the moment, maybe.</i>

31:54.973 --> 31:56.711
- She can't be that far.
- We'll find her.

31:56.954 --> 31:59.920
You better make it fast. The Replicators
could unfreeze at any moment.

32:00.016 --> 32:01.478
<i>Thanks, Rodney!</i>

32:03.951 --> 32:05.865
I admire your tenacity,

32:07.218 --> 32:08.773
but I won't be fooled again.

32:16.046 --> 32:18.260
You're struggling, Dr. Weir.

32:38.874 --> 32:40.304
Get to the jumper!

32:40.774 --> 32:42.264
You're coming with us.

32:42.928 --> 32:45.518
I can't keep them frozen much longer!

32:45.720 --> 32:47.812
We're not leaving you behind!

32:47.892 --> 32:49.506
If you don't leave right now,

32:49.615 --> 32:51.446
none of us will get out of here, so go!

32:51.556 --> 32:53.067
That's an order!

32:54.565 --> 32:55.694
Come on!

32:56.303 --> 32:57.238
Go!

33:01.594 --> 33:02.618
Oh, thank God.

33:07.772 --> 33:09.356
<i>Can we cloak?</i>

33:10.791 --> 33:12.432
Rodney, can we cloak?

33:13.604 --> 33:14.563
No, Not yet.

33:14.645 --> 33:17.716
We drained too much power trying
to convert the cloak into an AR field.

33:17.796 --> 33:20.468
I'll try to interface the ZPM,
but we're going to need some time.

33:21.563 --> 33:23.982
Alright, we'll just have
to make a run for it then.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.066
How's hyperspace looking?

33:34.527 --> 33:37.002
Not good. Harnessing power
from the ZPM is tricky.

33:37.084 --> 33:38.788
If I'm off even
 a slightest amount, then

33:38.884 --> 33:40.739
- we could all...
- Two ships heading our way.

33:43.574 --> 33:46.335
<i>- Rodney!</i>
- I need more time!

33:48.850 --> 33:50.123
We just lost weapons!

33:50.203 --> 33:51.505
- Dammit!
- Come on, McKay!

33:51.592 --> 33:53.018
This is not simple, you know?

33:53.100 --> 33:56.148
If I don't properly calibrate the power
output, we could incinerate the moment

33:56.243 --> 33:57.733
the hyperspace window opens!

34:00.166 --> 34:02.135
I'm picking something up dead ahead.

34:12.726 --> 34:13.928
Oh, crap.

34:15.478 --> 34:17.139
They're powering up weapons!

34:24.630 --> 34:26.451
What the hell was that?

34:30.780 --> 34:33.773
<i>Colonel Sheppard, this is the Apollo,
do you read?</i>

34:33.869 --> 34:35.460
Colonel Ellis, is that you?

34:35.540 --> 34:37.449
Affirmative. The 302 bay is open,

34:37.545 --> 34:40.456
and you have permission to come aboard.
I suggest you hurry.

34:40.594 --> 34:42.717
<i>Copy that, Apollo. We're on our way.</i>

34:42.876 --> 34:45.692
Can I just add that your timing
is pretty damn perfect?

34:45.802 --> 34:49.150
<i>We would've got here earlier, but we had
a little trouble finding Atlantis.</i>

34:51.119 --> 34:52.268
Wait, is that you?

34:52.731 --> 34:55.146
It's me, Rodney.
I'll explain when you get onboard.

34:55.342 --> 34:56.427
Colonel...

34:56.766 --> 34:59.817
We lost Dr. Weir
on the Replicator planet. Can you...

35:00.239 --> 35:02.672
<i>lock on her locator beacon
and beam her up?</i>

35:05.378 --> 35:07.158
I'm not picking up any signal.

35:10.791 --> 35:12.062
Copy that.

35:28.541 --> 35:31.247
Here's a good one, M35-117.

35:31.493 --> 35:34.411
- Does Dr. Weir know about it?
- Not on our primary or back-up list.

35:34.506 --> 35:37.089
I purposefully searched for a planet
we'd never considered before.

35:37.171 --> 35:40.426
The Replicators can probe her mind
all they want, they won't find it.

35:40.522 --> 35:41.669
Good...

35:42.047 --> 35:44.679
- For us.
- Well, look, it's a...

35:44.802 --> 35:47.303
stable atmosphere, a big ocean.

35:47.399 --> 35:49.408
Besides the large, particularly

35:49.490 --> 35:51.920
venomous snake-like creature
that inhabits the main land,

35:52.032 --> 35:54.081
it looks to be a welcoming environment.

35:56.047 --> 35:58.249
Alright. Radek, how we doing?

35:58.358 --> 36:00.887
<i>All set here. The ZPM is online.</i>

36:01.174 --> 36:02.253
OK,

36:02.663 --> 36:03.948
here we go.

36:23.316 --> 36:24.592
We did it.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.322
Well, there's still the small matter
of landing this thing.

36:29.043 --> 36:31.230
I'll just jump in the chair,
ease us down.

36:31.407 --> 36:32.868
Well, that could be tricky.

36:32.948 --> 36:35.289
We drained a lot of power
from the ZPM just getting here.

36:35.398 --> 36:37.757
We got enough energy to keep
the shield up for re-entry.

36:37.845 --> 36:40.531
There better be. A City this size
will create considerable friction.

36:40.627 --> 36:42.728
We come in too fast
or too steep, and the shield

36:42.824 --> 36:45.830
could attenuate under the stress,
the whole place will be torn to shreds

36:45.953 --> 36:47.466
or burn up, or both...

36:47.906 --> 36:49.593
It never ends with you, you know?

36:50.052 --> 36:50.886
What?

36:50.995 --> 36:53.263
Tell everyone to buckle up.
We're going in.

37:12.379 --> 37:14.120
Shield's holding. So far so good.

37:14.765 --> 37:17.069
- What's wrong?
- Angle's too steep.

37:17.178 --> 37:19.427
Like this, we're gonna put
too much strain on the shield,

37:19.509 --> 37:21.695
which means more power draining
from the ZPM.

37:21.805 --> 37:23.486
Sheppard, we're coming in too steep.

37:23.582 --> 37:25.545
We need to ease up
on the angle of re-entry.

37:26.370 --> 37:29.076
In fact, you mean entry.
You see, we never actually left this...

37:29.421 --> 37:30.717
Right, right.

37:36.952 --> 37:38.469
<i>Ease up on the angle!</i>

37:39.207 --> 37:41.061
I heard you the first time, Rodney.

37:41.434 --> 37:43.313
And yet we're still coming in too steep!

37:48.378 --> 37:49.593
Hang on!

37:56.553 --> 37:58.077
We're over the ocean!

37:58.316 --> 38:01.206
Sheppard you need to slow us down.
We're coming in over the water.

38:01.473 --> 38:02.635
Copy that.

38:09.915 --> 38:11.910
<i>Still too fast! Slow down!</i>

38:12.380 --> 38:13.885
<i>We want to touch down gently, like</i>

38:14.493 --> 38:16.803
like a leaf kissing
the surface of a pond.

38:37.237 --> 38:38.701
Nice kissing.

38:45.454 --> 38:46.459
How we doing?

38:48.553 --> 38:49.962
Systems are looking good...

38:50.042 --> 38:51.153
<i>So far,</i>

38:51.287 --> 38:52.982
and plenty of power in the ZPM.

38:54.267 --> 38:55.578
Drop the shield.

39:00.444 --> 39:02.207
<i>Colonel Sheppard, we made it.</i>

39:02.302 --> 39:04.640
<i>The City's floating safely on the ocean.</i>

39:05.118 --> 39:06.457
<i>Excellent landing.</i>

39:07.892 --> 39:09.092
Thank you.

39:45.109 --> 39:46.810
Who d'you think's gonna replace her?

39:50.426 --> 39:51.683
I don't know.

39:55.155 --> 39:56.426
Whoever it is...

39:57.697 --> 39:59.323
That's tough shoes to fill.

40:04.107 --> 40:05.245
Yes.

40:19.033 --> 40:21.307
- OK, let's give it a go.
- Right.

40:35.556 --> 40:38.098
This is Atlantis,
calling Stargate Command.

40:38.207 --> 40:39.437
Do you read?

40:43.878 --> 40:46.529
<i>We read you, Atlantis.
Good to hear from you.</i>

40:46.652 --> 40:47.950
Great to be heard.

40:48.055 --> 40:50.438
Tell General Landry
we're back on the grid.

40:50.861 --> 40:52.244
<i>Rodney...</i>

40:52.433 --> 40:53.617
What?

40:53.759 --> 40:55.378
Long-range scanners detect a massive

40:55.458 --> 40:58.228
<i>fleet of ships being launched
from the Replicator planet,</i>

40:59.677 --> 41:01.618
but they're not heading for us.

41:03.381 --> 41:05.049
That's a Wraith planet.

41:05.541 --> 41:07.891
The attack command
must have been activated.

41:07.971 --> 41:09.682
What do you know? It worked!

41:13.792 --> 41:15.180
There you are.

41:17.017 --> 41:18.329
Two moons.

41:18.616 --> 41:20.133
Actually, there are five.

41:20.256 --> 41:22.935
It's just these these are only two
visible to the naked eye.

41:23.878 --> 41:25.382
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:28.922 --> 41:32.243
Heard you and Rodney got us reconnected
to the intergalactic bridge.

41:32.366 --> 41:33.255
Yeah.

41:33.367 --> 41:36.370
General Landry was understandably
relieved to hear from us.

41:36.726 --> 41:40.402
You know, in all the excitement I never
got a chance to congratulate you.

41:42.356 --> 41:44.980
Your promotion.
You're a full bird Colonel now.

41:45.266 --> 41:46.366
Thank you.

41:48.217 --> 41:50.185
- So you sticking around?
- No.

41:50.704 --> 41:52.753
General Landry wants
Dr. Lee and I to gate back,

41:52.849 --> 41:55.354
give him a full briefing
on the situation here.

41:55.434 --> 41:57.284
The Apollo's gonna remain
in orbit for a while

41:57.393 --> 41:59.025
in case you need any assistance.

42:00.489 --> 42:03.428
Thanks for saving our asses
back there from the bad guys.

42:04.575 --> 42:06.119
That was a risky move.

42:06.229 --> 42:08.785
It was nothing compared to the risk
that you and your team took.

42:09.481 --> 42:12.037
Frankly, I'm amazed that
you were able to pull it off.

42:14.306 --> 42:15.564
We had a lot of help.

42:17.340 --> 42:18.441
Yeah.

42:19.786 --> 42:21.714
General Landry sends his condolences.

42:22.834 --> 42:25.634
