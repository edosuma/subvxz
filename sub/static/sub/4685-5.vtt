Morning, Bertram.

00:05.799 --> 00:08.300
I could use a banana,

00:03.295 --> 00:08.300
sunscreen, and some peanuts.

00:08.426 --> 00:09.511
And I could use a rich

00:10.720 --> 00:12.440
- I guess we're both

00:17.333 --> 00:18.937
all by myself in Central Park.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.730
- The banana's
- if I get hungry,

00:20.855 --> 00:22.249
- The sunscreen's
- in case it's hot,

00:22.273 --> 00:23.754
And the peanuts are in case

00:23.755 --> 00:25.234

00:49.468 --> 00:50.843

00:48.090 --> 00:50.843

09:59.016 --> 10:00.118
J.J. Mayfield, music producer.

10:00.142 --> 10:01.415
My card, my brochure,

10:01.416 --> 10:02.686
my profile.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.148
You make music videos?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.983
I make stars, kid.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.108
I make kids stars.

10:09.901 --> 10:11.778
You discovered T-Jam?

10:11.903 --> 10:13.822
- I just downloaded
- his latest ringtone.

10:13.947 --> 10:14.781
- I always wanted to be
- my own ringtone!

10:14.906 --> 10:16.067
- You think we're
- that good?

10:16.158 --> 10:17.598
I think spicy Italian

10:17.599 --> 10:19.036
sausage is good.

10:19.161 --> 10:20.975
I think world peace is good,

10:20.976 --> 10:22.789
but you guys are great.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.125
Let's make a demo.

10:24.126 --> 10:25.334
I'll kick open some doors,

10:22.914 --> 10:25.334
book some clubs.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.419
- Next stop, - "Hello, I'm famous.
- Who are you?"

10:28.420 --> 10:29.671
- Call me.
- We'll call you...

10:32.716 --> 10:34.134
- I think we just
- got discovered!

10:34.259 --> 10:35.553
I knew I was good,

10:35.554 --> 10:36.845
but I didn't know

10:34.259 --> 10:36.845
I was sausage good!

10:41.266 --> 10:43.602
Oh. It says here

10:43.603 --> 10:45.937
it costs $1,200 to

10:41.266 --> 10:45.937
produce a demo video.

10:46.063 --> 10:47.743
- How much do we have
- in the guitar case?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.380
42 dollars, 10 cents,

10:51.381 --> 10:53.945
three arcade tokens...

10:48.815 --> 10:53.945
Ooh! Some raisins.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.245
Definitely not raisins.

11:02.746 --> 11:03.746
Stupid squirrels!

11:09.920 --> 11:10.921
And here's the new you!

11:14.049 --> 11:15.049
Ugh.

11:17.386 --> 11:18.846
I guess the camera

11:18.847 --> 11:20.305
does add a few pounds.

11:20.431 --> 11:22.537
So does a steady diet

11:22.538 --> 11:24.643
of bacon and donuts.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.287
- Hey. Before you kids - came along, I was
- A swimsuit model.

11:26.311 --> 11:29.231
Really?

11:29.356 --> 11:30.566
No, but I didn't

11:30.567 --> 11:31.775
break a sweat

11:29.356 --> 11:31.775
putting on my socks.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.486
Don't worry, I'll just work

11:34.487 --> 11:36.655
a little computer magic.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.700
- First, let's add some
- highlights to your wig.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.159
EMMA: Oops.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.789
- I look like America's
- most wanted leprechaun.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.335
- Now, let's shave off
- a few pounds.

11:50.461 --> 11:52.170
You'll go from chunky...

11:53.338 --> 11:54.423
To hunky!

11:57.050 --> 11:58.302
Wow.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.137
- Can I borrow that
- for a second?

12:01.680 --> 12:02.681
(CHUCKLES)

12:04.642 --> 12:05.956
Okay, now you've

12:05.957 --> 12:07.269
gone too far.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.604
You look like

12:08.605 --> 12:09.813
a Bertram bobblehead.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.544
Who cares?

12:11.545 --> 12:13.024
I'm thin with hair.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.024
Press send.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.338
- Okay, how are we gonna
- come up with $1,200?

12:17.362 --> 12:19.906
Ooh!

12:20.031 --> 12:21.616
This has gotta be worth

12:21.617 --> 12:23.201
at least $1,250.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.703
We'll have money

12:24.704 --> 12:26.079
left over for sushi.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.605
- I can't steal from
- your parents.

12:28.873 --> 12:29.896
It's not stealing.

12:29.897 --> 12:30.917
It's just...

12:31.042 --> 12:33.587
Taking without permission.

12:33.712 --> 12:34.776
I can hear the judge

12:34.777 --> 12:35.839
laughing now.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.090
Okay, I have about

12:37.091 --> 12:38.216
$800 in savings.

12:38.342 --> 12:39.510
Great! I've got $100

12:39.511 --> 12:40.678
in birthday money.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.263
That equals

12:42.264 --> 12:43.681
the $1,200 we need!

12:43.847 --> 12:44.848
What we need

12:44.849 --> 12:45.849
is to get you

12:43.847 --> 12:45.849
a math tutor!

12:47.851 --> 12:48.894
ZURI: (ON INTERCOM)

12:48.895 --> 12:49.936
Maybe I can help you out.

12:50.688 --> 12:51.689
Zuri?

12:53.857 --> 12:55.275
- It's not polite
- to eavesdrop.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.152
I can let you have

12:57.153 --> 12:58.903
a hundred bucks.

12:59.738 --> 13:00.738
Keep talking.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.283
And I can give you

13:02.284 --> 13:03.659
the rest in rupees.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.850
I will be a silent partner.

13:06.851 --> 13:08.288
I will stay in the background.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.749
- I will support and strategize.
- I will...

13:10.874 --> 13:12.876
For a silent partner,

13:12.877 --> 13:14.878
you sure run your mouth.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.856
- Thanks, guys. - We'll pay you back
- Every penny.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.923
So?

13:19.049 --> 13:21.152
- Let's give Mr. Mayfield a call - and tell him
the JessieLuke - Project is ready to roll.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.657
(CHUCKLES) You mean

13:22.658 --> 13:24.137
the LukeJessie Project.

13:24.262 --> 13:26.014
- Oh, no, no, no,
- the JessieLuke Project.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.766
- LUKE: LukeJessie.
- JESSIE: Really?

13:27.891 --> 13:29.393
When this thing goes south,

13:29.394 --> 13:30.894
I get my money back

13:27.891 --> 13:30.894
before you.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.903
- This is it.
- Your launch pad.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.265
- (MIMICS EXPLOSION)
- Into orbit.

13:41.363 --> 13:42.364
(LAUGHS)

13:43.407 --> 13:44.929
Houston, we have a problem!

13:44.930 --> 13:46.451
Too much talent!

13:48.412 --> 13:50.727
Well, I did place second in

13:50.728 --> 13:53.041
my middle school talent show.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.774
I would have won, but Tiffany

13:55.775 --> 13:58.380
Haskell's flaming baton set my

13:53.166 --> 13:58.380
sock puppets on fire.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.924
- Great story.
- Save it for the talk shows.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.134
We're gonna be

14:02.135 --> 14:03.260
on talk shows?

14:03.385 --> 14:05.095
- I call the seat
- closest to Conan!

14:05.220 --> 14:06.576
What? Why do you get

14:06.577 --> 14:07.931
to sit next to Conan?

14:08.056 --> 14:09.141
Oh, because I have charm,

14:09.142 --> 14:10.225
talent and the freckles.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.310
Wow...

14:12.436 --> 14:13.436
Let's shoot this thing.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.063
- Here? Just in front
- of the wall?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.290
- We'll put the background
- in later.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.874
- You make your magic,
- I'll make mine.

14:19.943 --> 14:21.986
Forget that.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.239
- We need to zazz up the act.
- Here.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.328
How am I supposed to play

14:29.329 --> 14:31.246
a sensitive song of

14:27.409 --> 14:31.246
love and loss on this?

14:32.330 --> 14:33.791
Easy, like this.

14:33.957 --> 14:36.042
(DISTORTED CHORD RINGING)

14:37.961 --> 14:39.713
- My teeth are actually
- vibrating.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.257
Cool, huh?

14:42.382 --> 14:43.676
Now, go pour yourself

14:43.677 --> 14:44.968
into this.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.849
- Lovely.
- Where's the rest of it?

14:52.976 --> 14:54.061
Look, if we're

14:54.062 --> 14:55.145
making changes,

14:55.270 --> 14:56.980
it would be nice if your look

14:56.981 --> 14:58.690
matched the theme of my song.

14:58.816 --> 15:00.046
What, you want me

15:00.047 --> 15:01.276
to dress like a cowboy?

15:02.778 --> 15:03.778
(CHUCKLES)

15:03.862 --> 15:04.862
Howdy, partner.

15:10.327 --> 15:11.703
Hey, where you been,

15:11.704 --> 15:13.079
door munchkins?

15:13.204 --> 15:15.103
We gave Jessie and Luke money

15:15.104 --> 15:17.000
for their music video.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.544
They have been discovered

15:18.545 --> 15:20.003
by a big-time producer.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.087
Woot, woot!

15:21.880 --> 15:22.380
See?

15:22.506 --> 15:24.675
J.J. Mayfield?

15:24.800 --> 15:26.343
- The guy's
- a scam artist!

15:26.468 --> 15:27.991
He takes advantage of suckers

15:27.992 --> 15:29.513
with big dreams and small IQs.

15:29.638 --> 15:30.806
How do you know?

15:31.014 --> 15:32.119
Because I was one

15:32.120 --> 15:33.224
of those suckers!

15:33.350 --> 15:34.810
Last year, J.J. told me

15:34.811 --> 15:36.269
he could open doors,

15:36.394 --> 15:37.709
but 12 hundred bucks later,

15:37.710 --> 15:39.022
the only one opening doors

15:36.394 --> 15:39.022
is me!

15:42.192 --> 15:43.193
See?

15:44.695 --> 15:45.883
Jessie better not

15:45.884 --> 15:47.071
lose my money.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.553
I get paid back

15:48.554 --> 15:49.908
or things get ugly.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.245
How's it going?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.124
Thor?

16:01.712 --> 16:03.773
- I've been checking out - the profiles
of my - High school classmates,

16:03.797 --> 16:06.591
And I look so much better.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.928
They all got fat and bald!

16:10.053 --> 16:11.773
- And the guys don't look
- so great either.

16:12.222 --> 16:15.058
(TABLET CHIMES)

- I can't wait to get
- in touch with her!

If things work out,

16:23.693 --> 16:25.151
you're gonna be watching

16:22.232 --> 16:25.151
my tiny new butt

16:25.276 --> 16:26.695
strut off into the sunset.

16:28.405 --> 16:29.823
Right.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.409

Please tell me she's a school

16:42.628 --> 16:44.170
teacher or she operates

16:41.084 --> 16:44.170
a pickpocket ring.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.423
Nope.

16:46.548 --> 16:47.591
They're tagged with

16:47.592 --> 16:48.633
the same last name.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.176
They're all hers.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.619
And look! It says

16:54.620 --> 16:55.849
she wants to have more.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.272
What a waste.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.692
I can't believe I worked

17:05.693 --> 17:07.193
so hard to get into shape.

17:07.318 --> 17:08.998
- I'm gonna go get
- a bacon-wrapped donut.

17:10.948 --> 17:12.866
- You sure don't look
- like Dr. Chang,

17:14.367 --> 17:16.286
But okay.

Here's your key.

Tony's job is tougher

17:25.526 --> 17:26.922
than it looks.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.194
Yeah. And I ate too many

17:28.194 --> 17:29.257
kickback cookies.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.384
I feel sick.

Here are your

17:43.146 --> 17:45.356
- Oh, looks like
- your macaroni salad spilled.

17:50.988 --> 17:52.593
That wasn't macaroni salad.

17:52.594 --> 17:54.198
That was tossed cookies.

17:56.034 --> 17:57.599
Uh-oh. Now I feel terrible

17:57.600 --> 17:59.162
for taking her tip.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.288
And I will get over it.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.653
I look so stupid.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.717
If I saw me,

18:08.588 --> 18:12.717
I'd beat myself up.

18:12.843 --> 18:14.929
Well, I'm wearing

18:14.930 --> 18:17.014
a dress that, in my hometown,

18:12.843 --> 18:17.014
would get me arrested.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.932
What's your hometown?

18:18.933 --> 18:20.684
Lamesville, USA?

18:20.809 --> 18:22.936
No! That's our sister city.

18:24.646 --> 18:25.981
- Hey, hey.
- You both look great.

18:26.189 --> 18:28.001
- Let's show the video camera
- how great you look!

First, she has

18:29.111 --> 18:30.193
to change her song.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.921
- It's just a backup
- for my dancing anyways!

(GASPS) No, you are

18:33.510 --> 18:35.073

18:31.945 --> 18:35.073
for my singing.

18:35.198 --> 18:38.743
(GASPS)

18:38.869 --> 18:40.245
The only reason people will

18:40.246 --> 18:41.621
watch this video is because

18:38.869 --> 18:41.621
I'm starring in it!

You little egomaniac.

Do, re, mi. Me.

18:44.041 --> 18:46.793
Not you, me!

18:46.918 --> 18:48.566
Who cares? I got

18:48.567 --> 18:50.213
a Lady Gaga wannabe

18:46.918 --> 18:50.213
coming in half an hour,

18:50.296 --> 18:51.694
and if I keep her waiting,

18:51.695 --> 18:53.091
her meat dress is gonna spoil.

18:55.010 --> 18:57.011
