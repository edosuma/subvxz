WEBVTT

00:00.950 --> 00:03.151
RUXIN: So that dumb jock,
Bethesda, was pissed, and

00:03.285 --> 00:06.571
Hudabega was rip shit about
Geoffrey's little baseball

00:06.705 --> 00:08.156
incident.
PETE: You mean the "little

00:08.290 --> 00:10.124
incident" where you gave your
only son performance-enhancing

00:10.242 --> 00:13.661
drugs? You still have that
Sammy Sosa jersey? Yeah.

00:13.829 --> 00:15.496
Yeah, game's more interesting
that way. What can I say?

00:15.664 --> 00:17.131
KEVIN: Well, did Hudabega
fire you, then?

00:17.249 --> 00:19.467
No, I didn't get fired, but
I've been banished to Korea.

00:19.585 --> 00:21.719
(Kevin groans)
We represent the company that

00:21.837 --> 00:24.472
owns the ferry that allegedly
tipped over and killed all those

00:24.590 --> 00:26.307
people.
Allegedly?

00:26.425 --> 00:28.176
My job is to prove that
everybody walked to one side of

00:28.310 --> 00:30.261
the ferry to look over the side.
At what?

00:30.396 --> 00:32.479
Perhaps the Malaysian plane.
I can't speculate at this point.

00:32.598 --> 00:35.400
Wow.
And the thing tipped over.

00:35.517 --> 00:39.103
Allegedly. TACO: You know what you
should bring? You should bring this.

00:39.238 --> 00:41.573
You don't want to look like a
tourist.

00:41.690 --> 00:43.858
A tiny gong.
Thanks, Taco.

00:44.026 --> 00:45.706
We're gonna really miss you,
though, Ruxin.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.662
I think you guys really are
gonna miss me.

00:47.780 --> 00:50.248
I know that I am the denture
glue that keeps these teeth in

00:50.366 --> 00:54.702
the mouth that is this league,
and I want you to know I'm gonna

00:54.837 --> 00:58.506
stay involved. I'm gonna be present for
everyone, 'cause I know you need it.

00:58.624 --> 01:00.258
Right.
I, for example, will not

01:00.376 --> 01:03.678
cease to taunt Andre with the
fury of a thousand suns for what

01:03.796 --> 01:07.432
he did.
ANDRE: I have no words.

01:07.549 --> 01:10.051
Except for two.
I'm sorry.

01:10.219 --> 01:12.687
(whispering): I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:12.805 --> 01:14.722
What, are you taking us to prom?

01:14.890 --> 01:18.810
No, you are now a part of the
Andre apology tour.

01:18.944 --> 01:22.897
I have colluded against you with
the great Jay Glazer, and I

01:23.032 --> 01:26.651
accept my punishment, so hit me
with what you got.

01:26.785 --> 01:28.903
Sure.
Cool.

01:29.038 --> 01:32.490
Okay. Why do these flowers smell
like Polo Sport? Beside the point!

01:32.625 --> 01:34.409
I need to know what the
punishment is.

01:34.576 --> 01:36.711
Understood.
We'll let you know.

01:36.829 --> 01:38.670
You can't do this to me!
You have to punish me.

01:38.797 --> 01:40.748
Punish me!
Classic bottom.

01:40.916 --> 01:42.550
All right, if a bullet is
coming, I need to know when it's

01:42.668 --> 01:43.918
coming.
That makes sense.

01:44.086 --> 01:46.054
Just tell me now.
I understand your concern.

01:46.171 --> 01:47.889
You're a bunch of dicks.
No, sorry, I take that back.

01:48.007 --> 01:49.807
You're not dicks.
I apologize for that.

01:49.925 --> 01:51.676
Put that in the apology to as well.

01:51.810 --> 01:53.594
You can keep the flowers.
I love you all.

01:53.762 --> 01:56.097
(stammers)
All right, good talk, Andre.

01:56.265 --> 01:58.232
Thanks for the flowers, Andre.

01:58.350 --> 02:00.685
Thank you.
So what's the punishment?

02:00.819 --> 02:02.487
There is no punishment.
Ghost punishment.

02:02.604 --> 02:04.272
Ah.
The best.

02:04.440 --> 02:06.190
But Ruxin still has
to go to Korea.

02:06.325 --> 02:08.192
Yeah, but that's more like a
reward for us.

02:08.327 --> 02:10.360
You're gonna want to take
this with you, too.

02:10.496 --> 02:12.536
I don't think there's anything
like that over there.

02:12.614 --> 02:17.593
Is this secretly filled with pot for me
to give to some weirdo in Korea? Nope.

02:17.959 --> 02:23.407
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:23.527 --> 02:25.978
The truth is, I've been here
for a long time, performing at a

02:26.113 --> 02:29.065
very high level.
I've been here for a long time,

02:29.199 --> 02:33.236
and I feel I deserve a raise.
I hear you, I really do.

02:33.370 --> 02:35.321
Good. Okay.
I want you to hear me when I

02:35.456 --> 02:37.907
say absolutely not.
Why would we do that?

02:38.075 --> 02:40.626
A raise for me could do a lot
to boost morale around

02:40.744 --> 02:42.962
this place.
I could be, like, the Rudy for

02:43.080 --> 02:45.498
this entire office of sad sack
losers.

02:45.632 --> 02:51.087
That's your pitch? Well, that and... I
got a really nice bottle of Chardonnay.

02:51.221 --> 02:53.256
Ooh.
Oh, I've heard of that, but I

02:53.423 --> 02:54.924
haven't tried it.
I think we should crack this

02:55.092 --> 02:57.310
bad boy open, celebrate my
raise.

02:57.427 --> 03:03.432
Huh. Well... (sighs)
I'll tell you what.

03:03.567 --> 03:06.102
Maybe in a couple weeks-- it's
my birthday-- but, uh, no raise.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.111
Give me my Chardonnay back.
Give me my Chard...

03:08.272 --> 03:09.772
No, no, no, that's not how
it's done.

03:09.907 --> 03:11.741
You don't give Chardonnay and
then ask for it back.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.776
Hmm-mm.
Fine.

03:13.911 --> 03:16.245
Yeah. Savage.
Ah, ah, ah! No, no, no, no, no!

03:16.363 --> 03:20.583
Off, off, off, off, off! Off!
Goddamn it!

03:20.701 --> 03:23.169
So my dickhead boss totally
Heisman-ed my attempt for a

03:23.287 --> 03:27.006
raise. I swear, I think he's trying to
franchise-tag me. Franchise-tag you?

03:27.124 --> 03:28.758
Yeah.
You think you deserve to be

03:28.876 --> 03:31.117
paid the average of the top five
people at your position?

03:31.211 --> 03:33.629
That's a good point.
You want to get paid like

03:33.764 --> 03:35.965
Darelle Revis, but you don't
have a competing offer.

03:36.099 --> 03:37.683
JENNY: Yeah, you need
that leverage.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.761
You need a stocking horse.
Okay, I figured it out.

03:39.803 --> 03:42.438
I figured out my punishment.
You guys hid my car keys, right?

03:42.556 --> 03:47.310
No. Who, then, wrecked my trilby
hat from my Hat of the Month Club?

03:47.444 --> 03:49.278
God.
Or a really, really smart,

03:49.396 --> 03:51.397
fashionable person.
I just want to know what my

03:51.532 --> 03:54.283
punishment is, and can it please
just happen today?

03:54.401 --> 03:56.642
Not how it works, Andre.
The punishee does not decide the

03:56.737 --> 03:58.898
schedule of the punisher.
Yeah, you don't get to decide

03:58.906 --> 04:00.957
when you get mugged.
I'm gonna get mugged?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.326
Maybe.
Just sit down and relax.

04:03.460 --> 04:06.379
Oh, I'll sit down in this
chair, Jenny?

04:06.496 --> 04:08.497
Or continue to stand up and
be a weirdo.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.800
I guess now because you want
me to stand, I will sit.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.835
We'd love you to leave.
Well, then, guess what.

04:13.003 --> 04:16.305
I'm gonna <i> stay</i> in this chair.
(chuckles) Figuring all of this

04:16.423 --> 04:19.175
out.
Okay.

04:19.309 --> 04:23.429
Oh, damn it! Oh! You... God!
(grunts) I lost to Russell.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.681
Well, you should have played
Sproles in the flex.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.010
You got him sitting on your
bench, and he's killing it.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.152
Honestly, I thought it was a
Vincent Jackson play.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.438
Why?
He's huge.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.992
So you choose your lineup
based on height?

04:36.109 --> 04:39.362
It is a big man's game, Pete.
You know what?

04:39.496 --> 04:41.831
You're a height supremacist,
Jenny.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.699
Excuse me?
Uh-huh.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.451
That's a pretty big accusation.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.867
I am not a height supremacist.
I have Russell Wilson on my

04:47.955 --> 04:49.922
team.
And you never play him.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.508
Yeah, and by the way,
remember she passed on Randall

04:52.626 --> 04:56.262
Cobb in the seventh to pick up Kelvin
Benjamin, an unproven rookie? Yeah.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.700
I don't feel bad about that.
Kelvin Benjamin is six-six and

04:58.765 --> 05:01.434
he has the catch radius of a guy
who is six-nine.

05:01.551 --> 05:05.605
I rest my case, Your Honor. Hey, Pete,
what are you doing? Eagles-Colts.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.762
Great. I need to run some
Taco Corp business by you.

05:07.891 --> 05:09.942
Now, Taco Corp's getting into
real estate.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.228
Great.
Uh... what do you think?

05:12.396 --> 05:14.614
It-it-it looks great.
Can you... Yes.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.148
What does it look like on
this side?

05:16.283 --> 05:17.566
It looks great over there, too.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.201
Yeah, what about the font?
Yes.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.569
Yeah, lower, you want it higher?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.488
Taco, yes, as a board member,
I approve.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.457
Great. Easy.
Taco, how are you gonna buy

05:24.574 --> 05:26.909
houses if you clearly can't even
afford a printer?

05:27.077 --> 05:29.078
I mean, you do it.
Can't be that hard.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.913
I don't think you understand
how real estate works.

05:31.048 --> 05:33.165
I don't think he understands
how signs work.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.418
Look, I get that you guys are
skeptical, okay?

05:35.585 --> 05:39.171
When Steve Jobs invented the
first job, everyone thought he

05:39.306 --> 05:42.141
was an idiot, but today,
everyone has jobs.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.261
And look how well Steve Jobs is
doing. Hmm?

05:45.395 --> 05:48.264
When are you guys gonna realize
that Taco Corp is a real

05:48.398 --> 05:52.318
corporation with real employees
and real board members?

05:52.436 --> 05:57.940
Interesting.
What the hell?

05:58.075 --> 06:00.993
Let me guess, Taco Corp is
entering the space race, and

06:01.111 --> 06:04.664
this is your rocket ship?
Love how you push me to be

06:04.781 --> 06:07.283
better, Pete, but no.
This is the first-ever

06:07.417 --> 06:10.419
EBDB kiosk.
That's right, you can sign up

06:10.537 --> 06:13.205
and find out who your Eskimo
brothers are in the comfort of

06:13.340 --> 06:18.294
"The EBDB does not treat
venereal diseases."

06:18.428 --> 06:20.796
No, a couple people found
that out the hard way.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.965
Listen, I have a business
proposition for you.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.967
I'm trying to get a raise.
No, no, no, no, if you're

06:25.135 --> 06:27.136
gonna talk business, we need to
do it in the boardroom.

06:27.270 --> 06:28.721
I think we're fine right here.

06:28.855 --> 06:30.973
Follow me.
It's just one door down.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.726
First door on your left.
Yes.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.728
Come on in, sir.
Oh, God. Jesus.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.730
Yeah.
Okay.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.949
Welcome, sir.
What I need is for Taco Corp

06:40.067 --> 06:42.485
to write me a job offer for
$150,000.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.653
Whoa, that's pretty steep, Pete.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.861
The good news is, you don't
actually have to pay me.

06:46.873 --> 06:50.242
(fly buzzing)
I can't tell which is more

06:50.377 --> 06:52.244
professional, the boardroom or
the kiosk.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.379
I think they're both fine.
I don't think they're...

06:54.381 --> 06:56.248
No, you know what, I think
the kiosk.

06:56.383 --> 06:59.468
Let's move it back to the kiosk.
Come on, follow me.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.170
All right.
Move it to the kiosk.

07:01.338 --> 07:05.474
All right. Yeah, this is
much more business-y. Good.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.676
It's like my good friend Mark
from Cuba says, "How you do the

07:07.811 --> 07:10.262
small things is how you do
everything."

07:10.397 --> 07:16.769
All right, now, um, here we go...
First name. Spartacus.

07:16.903 --> 07:19.522
You know what? This would better in the
boardroom. You know, I think this is

07:19.689 --> 07:22.024
fine, right here. This-this is
boardroom, let's do it. Follow me!

07:22.192 --> 07:23.859
Real... Jesus Christ.
Here we go!

07:24.027 --> 07:29.698
So, next question: Where do you see
yourself five years in the past? What?

07:29.833 --> 07:33.202
Okay, this one's a quizzler:
What kind of horse is this?

07:33.370 --> 07:36.622
Appaloosa.
Appaloosa... okay.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.875
Let me test your reflexes.
Lift up your hand... whoa.

07:40.010 --> 07:41.710
Wow.
Yeah.

07:41.845 --> 07:44.797
Just met you, Spartacus, but I
really like you, and I think

07:44.931 --> 07:46.382
that...
(fly buzzing)

07:46.550 --> 07:50.052
Oh, God, no, please, please.
Just feel like...

07:50.220 --> 07:52.605
You are fake hired.
Fake thank you.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.690
I am gonna write up the fake
contract.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.525
You know, let me write the
offer and then you can just kind

07:56.643 --> 07:58.944
of sign it.
That sounds like business.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.832
Hey, use some of that newfound
fake money to cover my parking,

08:00.952 --> 08:02.017
will you?
(whoops)

08:02.137 --> 08:03.477
You got it, Taco.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:13.778 --> 08:15.579
Okay...
Welcome to the schmooze-fest.

08:15.699 --> 08:20.816
No, it's nice. Okay, there is my new
boss, Mr. Lipscome. He's a D.A.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.652
Lipscome?
Lipscome.

08:22.819 --> 08:24.203
Lipscome.
Don't make it filthy.

08:24.321 --> 08:26.455
His name is "Lipscome."
I know, but emphasis on the

08:26.573 --> 08:28.741
"lips," not the "come" part.
Lips... Lipscome.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.994
Just let it go, okay? Mr. Lipscome...
Now, I don't know much about him.

08:32.162 --> 08:34.282
All I know is he's from Philly
and he's an Eagles fan.

08:34.298 --> 08:35.464
That's my language.
Great.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.465
I can do this.
Great.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.668
I can do this. Do you want, like, flirty
and sophisticated? Do you want...

08:38.802 --> 08:40.135
No, no, no, no.
...guy's girl?

08:40.254 --> 08:42.505
I can go sexy.
I'd settle for sober.

08:42.639 --> 08:45.925
Just go over to him, tell him
how much I admire him, his worth

08:46.059 --> 08:48.511
ethic, blah, blah, blah...
Babe, I got this.

08:48.645 --> 08:49.679
Good.
Okay?

08:49.813 --> 08:51.013
Okay.
I would like a martini.

08:51.148 --> 08:52.481
No.
Gimlet?

08:52.599 --> 08:54.684
Thank you.
The shrimp needs to be

08:54.818 --> 08:58.104
chilled, not frozen. When you freeze
it, ice crystals form. Mr. Lipscome.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.323
Hello, I'm Jenny MacArthur.
I'm Kevin's wife.

09:00.440 --> 09:03.409
It is so nice to meet you.
I can't tell you how excited

09:03.527 --> 09:05.745
Kevin is to work with you.
He looks up to you, and...

09:05.862 --> 09:08.497
Um... it's...
(Lipscome chuckles)

09:08.615 --> 09:11.033
That's, uh, it's actually me.
I'm Gary Lipscome.

09:11.201 --> 09:13.336
Oh, I'm so sorry!
That's all right.

09:13.453 --> 09:16.005
He was just so tall and...
I'm sorry?

09:16.123 --> 09:21.544
He... he just, uh, was very...
Tall, you said. Like a D.A.

09:21.678 --> 09:24.263
He's tall like a D.A....
I... it was...

09:24.381 --> 09:26.098
...and I'm short and
therefore not like a D.A., is

09:26.216 --> 09:27.883
that what you're trying to say?
No.

09:28.018 --> 09:30.553
No, that is not what I am saying
at all.

09:30.721 --> 09:34.690
You're crouching.
No, I'm... I'm not.

09:34.808 --> 09:38.227
Funny thing is, I love short people.

09:38.395 --> 09:41.280
Some of my very closest friends
are short.

09:41.398 --> 09:43.366
Oh, hello.
Hi.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.734
Hi.
Thank you.

09:44.868 --> 09:46.569
Honey... oh.
Uh, Mr. Lipscome.

09:46.737 --> 09:50.790
MacArthur.
He's very grumpy.

09:50.907 --> 09:52.742
What is wrong with you?
Why can't you keep your height

09:52.909 --> 09:56.712
power thoughts to yourself? Kevin,
he is shockingly short. So?

09:56.830 --> 09:58.714
There is Peter Dinklage,
there is Mr. Lipscome, and then

09:58.832 --> 10:01.133
there's the rest of us.
"Us"?

10:01.251 --> 10:03.586
My God, come on, Adolf
Heightler.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.971
Geez, Louise...
I didn't mean to offend your

10:06.089 --> 10:08.891
boss.
I look at all heights equally.

10:09.009 --> 10:12.311
Yeah, sure you do.
Sieg height!

10:12.429 --> 10:13.929
Height!
No, it's not funny.

10:14.064 --> 10:16.766
That's offensive.
I have plenty of short friends.

10:16.933 --> 10:19.735
Oh, good.
Who?

10:19.853 --> 10:21.103
Ellie.
Not a friend.

10:21.238 --> 10:22.605
That's your child.
(over computer): I don't even

10:22.739 --> 10:24.106
think Ellie considers you a
friend.

10:24.241 --> 10:26.742
Blah, you just keep it down,
Computer Ruxin.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.661
I told you I wouldn't abandon
the league.

10:28.779 --> 10:30.996
That's why I zinged you from
around the globe.

10:31.114 --> 10:33.082
You're a great friend, Ruxin.
How's Korea?

10:33.200 --> 10:36.619
It's a shitstorm horrorscape.
The only advantage is that I'm

10:36.787 --> 10:39.955
up when the waiver wire opens.
(man speaking Korean)

10:40.090 --> 10:42.958
Yeah.
(man speaking Korean)

10:43.093 --> 10:45.461
Sorry, Mr. O.
Who is yelling at you?

10:45.595 --> 10:47.630
His name is Mr. O.
He's either the president of the

10:47.798 --> 10:49.849
company or he may be my
assistant.

10:49.966 --> 10:51.851
I can't tell.
Everybody just screams all the

10:51.968 --> 10:54.470
time.
The people here never go home.

10:54.604 --> 10:57.306
All they do is work.
Honestly, Kevin, the janitors

10:57.474 --> 10:59.725
are more motivated than you.
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

10:59.860 --> 11:01.221
Come here, I'll show you
motivated.

11:01.311 --> 11:02.812
Hey! Where am I going?
Oh, yeah!

11:02.946 --> 11:04.814
Oh, my God, is Sala.
Ah.

11:04.948 --> 11:06.816
Show him that pretty...
Deal with that.

11:06.983 --> 11:08.234
You know what?
I'm sorry.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.821
I-I messed up. But I am going to fix
this, okay? He's from Philly, right?

11:11.988 --> 11:13.823
Yeah.
Okay, I can work with this.

11:13.957 --> 11:16.292
I'm so sorry I'm late!
I knew that you guys had started

11:16.410 --> 11:19.128
without me.
One Cosmopolitan, please.

11:19.246 --> 11:24.500
Hi, I am Andrea.
Are we talking about football?

11:24.634 --> 11:27.670
I love their costumes, they're
so cute.

11:27.804 --> 11:30.756
What is going on?
It's me, Andre.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.142
Oh!
What are you doing, Andre?

11:33.260 --> 11:36.178
Since you guys haven't yet
punished me, I decided I would

11:36.313 --> 11:39.432
punish myself.
Is it really a punishment, or

11:39.566 --> 11:41.350
are you just kind of exploring
some things?

11:41.518 --> 11:43.558
Yeah, I dressed like a woman.
This is my punishment.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.738
I just feel like a punishment
should be something that's hard,

11:45.856 --> 11:47.336
and you just seem to be smiling
a lot.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.941
Like, right now, you're
really...

11:49.075 --> 11:51.861
Because I don't want to... I
don't want you to think I'm not

11:51.995 --> 11:53.863
doing it...
How often are doing this?

11:53.997 --> 11:56.198
I'm super excited, 'cause I
want more girlfriends.

11:56.333 --> 11:59.084
We should totally go out and
get skinny margs...

11:59.202 --> 12:00.870
Yeah.
...and have some nachos.

12:01.037 --> 12:04.457
Well, you know what? I think Ruxin
would like to see some of this. Ruxin?

12:04.591 --> 12:06.091
Thank you, finally. Meet Andrea.

12:06.209 --> 12:09.128
Holy shit!
Is that little Ruxin?

12:09.262 --> 12:12.381
Hi, Ruxin, it's me, Andrea.
I think I had fish and soy

12:12.516 --> 12:14.884
milk for breakfast and this is
more disgusting.

12:15.018 --> 12:16.719
Oh, my gosh.
Turn around, baby.

12:16.853 --> 12:18.604
What's that?
You want to see me dance?

12:18.722 --> 12:20.973
That's right, Andre.
Give Daddy a show.

12:21.107 --> 12:25.361
♪ I'm a naughty girl
In a dirty little world

12:25.479 --> 12:29.865
Will you show me what to do? ♪
I think there's a bunch of

12:29.983 --> 12:33.986
businessmen here who would pay a lot
of money for your panties, Andre. Huh?

12:34.120 --> 12:35.654
What?
(man speaking Korean)

12:35.789 --> 12:37.072
Korea signing off.
Sorry, so sorry, so sorry.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.625
Oh, bye, bye.
Are we done?

12:39.743 --> 12:42.628
No, Andre, you don't get to
decide your own punishment.

12:42.746 --> 12:45.297
We set the punishment and you go
by our sweet time.

12:45.415 --> 12:47.583
Oh, come on, man!
This is bullshit.

12:47.751 --> 12:50.002
You think I like this?
I don't like this.

12:50.136 --> 12:53.172
Okay? I'm a man!
And I deserve respect.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.706
You've got it, Andre.
Put 'er there.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.642
Thank... hey!
You do not get to touch that!

12:56.760 --> 13:03.015
Hey! Hey! Ah... I broke a heel.
Damn it!

13:03.149 --> 13:06.769
These were Manolo Blahniks.
I have to say, this is the

13:06.937 --> 13:09.605
best I've ever seen him dress.
He looked beautiful.

13:09.739 --> 13:12.575
Why are there condoms in here?

13:12.692 --> 13:16.245
Dear Mr. Darren Sproles, my
name is Ellie MacArthur, and I

13:16.363 --> 13:18.914
would like to invite you to my
Sadie Hawkins dance.

13:19.032 --> 13:23.669
It may sound a little cheesy--
or maybe cheese-steaky-- but the

13:23.787 --> 13:27.289
Eagles are my favorite team and
you're my favorite player.

13:27.457 --> 13:29.792
What are the Eagles?
Oh, cut!

13:29.960 --> 13:32.261
Ellie!
Just say what I wrote.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.463
And turn up the cute factor.
I need you to smile with your

13:34.631 --> 13:37.132
whole face.
Once I get that little man

13:37.267 --> 13:39.301
dancing on the dance floor, no
one's ever gonna call me a

13:39.469 --> 13:41.854
height supremacist.
And... action!

13:41.972 --> 13:49.144
Dear Mr. Darren Sproles... No, no, no...
Taco Corp. Never heard of 'em.

13:49.312 --> 13:50.633
Well, they're a brand-new
startup.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.565
They're incubating a pretty
radical new platform in the

13:52.699 --> 13:55.284
social media space.
I don't know what that means.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.286
Neither do I.
But they've made me an

13:57.404 --> 14:00.155
aggressive offer, Bill.
And as they say, I'm forced to

14:00.290 --> 14:05.327
consider it. All right, well, let me take
this upstairs and see what I can do.

14:05.495 --> 14:07.379
That's good, 'cause I'd hate
to, uh, take back that bottle of

14:07.497 --> 14:10.583
Chardonnay.
You son of a bitch.

14:10.717 --> 14:15.888
I'll make the call now.
>> <i> Thursday Night Football--</i>

14:16.006 --> 14:17.890
could it get any better than
this?

14:18.008 --> 14:19.892
I wish football was on every
night-- Friday night, Saturday

14:20.010 --> 14:21.977
night.
They should have football

14:22.095 --> 14:24.346
every night, not just Thursdays.
Yeah, I just said that,

14:24.481 --> 14:27.349
Ruxin.
We... Forget it.

14:27.484 --> 14:30.853
What's your issue?
What? I got to, I got to pee.

14:30.987 --> 14:33.155
Go pee. The bathroom's right
there.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.158
Oh, no, I'm not gonna go pee
so you guys can pull out your

14:36.276 --> 14:38.327
little punishment tricks.
No, no, no. No, thank you.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.245
I don't need something up my
butt.

14:40.363 --> 14:42.665
There's a first.
(both laugh)

14:42.782 --> 14:44.867
There's a first.
We said that already.

14:45.001 --> 14:47.169
I already said that, Computer
Ruspin.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.872
Oh, shit! Kevin, your first
drink is on me.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.541
Thanks to your Taco Corp plan,
I got a raise!

14:52.709 --> 14:54.710
Who's here-- is that Pete?
No.

14:54.844 --> 14:56.712
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

14:56.846 --> 14:58.714
So, you're staying at your
old job?

14:58.848 --> 15:00.768
Yeah, of course I am.
You're refusing Taco Corp's

15:00.884 --> 15:03.218
offer?
It was a fake offer, Taco.

15:03.386 --> 15:06.021
It was generous!
It was beyond generous!

15:06.139 --> 15:08.023
You were never gonna pay me!
I was gonna pretend to pay

15:08.141 --> 15:10.392
you. A deal's a deal!
Whatever, Taco.

15:10.527 --> 15:12.444
I'm staying at my old job.
Sorry.

15:12.562 --> 15:14.480
Oh, my... You are making a
huge mistake.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.534
Taco Corp is blowing up and
you're gonna miss it.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.951
You know why, Pete No Known Last
Name?

15:19.069 --> 15:22.955
Because you're fired!
(all oohing)

15:23.073 --> 15:26.041
No, Mr. O, I-I wasn't making
fun of your last name or your

15:26.159 --> 15:28.494
culture.
For that delayed comment,

15:28.628 --> 15:31.130
Ruspin, you're fired, too!
You're all fired!

15:31.247 --> 15:33.132
I'm gonna get some ice cream.
You guys need anything?

15:33.249 --> 15:35.134
No, thanks.
No, I'm good.

15:35.251 --> 15:37.336
Is he getting ice cream?
Taco's gonna put a bee in

15:37.470 --> 15:40.255
Andre's ice cream?
Holy shit, you guys!

15:40.390 --> 15:42.391
Darren Sproles said yes!
What?!

15:42.509 --> 15:44.393
Yes!
Get out of here.

15:44.511 --> 15:47.096
Let me see! Let me see!
Hi, Ellie.

15:47.230 --> 15:49.630
This is Darren Sproles and I
would love to attend your school

15:49.766 --> 15:52.151
dance with you.
I'll be there.

15:52.268 --> 15:54.153
Babe, you did this?
This is great!

15:54.270 --> 15:56.155
My boss is a huge Eagles fan!
I know!

15:56.272 --> 15:58.157
This is gonna be good for me.
Aw, Darren Sproles, you are

15:58.274 --> 16:00.943
so cool and smart and nice and
short.

16:01.077 --> 16:03.445
Wait, Martin Short is in the
video?

16:03.613 --> 16:05.447
Yeah, he... Ruxin!

16:07.793 --> 16:10.865
Oh, there's our guest of
honor Darren Sproles!

16:10.985 --> 16:12.852
Ellie, this is the highlight of
your existence.

16:12.987 --> 16:16.856
It is, babe. It's never going to get
better than this right now. Yeah...

16:16.991 --> 16:18.858
You know what, let's start
with a Dad picture.

16:18.993 --> 16:20.860
Yeah, we need a Dad picture.
Get in there.

16:20.995 --> 16:24.864
All right, ready? One, two...
Yeah! Yes!

16:24.999 --> 16:26.866
My turn! Look, I have to.
I'm sorry.

16:27.001 --> 16:29.168
Okay, all right.
Okay, you ready?

16:29.286 --> 16:33.089
All right. Uh, one, two...
Shiva-ship!

16:33.207 --> 16:35.091
What are you...?
What are you...?

16:35.209 --> 16:37.260
Did you get it?
No, no, no, no!

16:37.378 --> 16:39.462
What are you guys doing here?
We did not want to miss

16:39.596 --> 16:41.597
Ellie's special day.
Me neither.

16:41.715 --> 16:43.683
All right, just pace
yourselves. I get him first.

16:43.801 --> 16:45.685
What is your...?
Why are you squirming?

16:45.803 --> 16:47.687
What's your problem?
I have a U.T.I.

16:47.805 --> 16:49.689
What?
A urinary tract infection.

16:49.807 --> 16:51.691
It's no big deal.
Don't you get that by

16:51.809 --> 16:53.059
having sex with lots and lots
of people?

16:53.227 --> 16:56.187
Yeah, that's one way. One way you will
never get it. Okay, well, I got mine

16:56.230 --> 16:58.114
because I held in my pee too
long.

16:58.232 --> 17:00.116
The Seahawks have Beast
Mode and we have Yeast Mode.

17:00.234 --> 17:03.152
No Yeast Mode, okay?
I'm regular Andre.

17:03.287 --> 17:05.154
Uh-uh. From Tefl-Andre to
Yeast Mode.

17:05.289 --> 17:07.156
That is a punishment I can get
behind.

17:07.290 --> 17:09.251
Darren, what do you think?
No, no, please, Darren?

17:09.292 --> 17:11.160
No! Don't talk to him!
Hi, hi, uh, Mr. Sproles.

17:11.295 --> 17:13.162
I'm-I'm Pete Eckhart.
I'm just a huge fan.

17:13.297 --> 17:15.164
It's so great to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

17:15.299 --> 17:17.165
I'm, uh, Dr. Andre Nowzik.
I'm the number one plastic

17:17.300 --> 17:20.053
surgeon in Chicago, and, uh,
this is our friend Ruxin.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.387
It's such a treat that you're
there, Darren, especially since

17:22.506 --> 17:27.926
Jenny hates short people. What?
Ruxin... Really? Uh... no!

17:28.095 --> 17:31.764
That is so not true.
I love anything short.

17:31.899 --> 17:33.766
I love short people.
Are you hungry?

17:33.934 --> 17:35.768
You should have something to
eat before you dance the night

17:35.936 --> 17:38.020
away. Here you go.
Minis?

17:38.155 --> 17:40.022
What?
Minis?

17:40.157 --> 17:42.024
No! They're-they're fun size.
Fun size, huh?

17:42.159 --> 17:44.026
No!
Come on now.

17:44.161 --> 17:46.041
Oh, I didn't mean it like
that, come on, Darren!

17:46.163 --> 17:50.032
No, the truth is, Jenny has always
been a fan of the short players. Yes!

17:50.167 --> 17:54.036
You know, she keeps her fantasy
roster stacked with them. Yeah.

17:54.171 --> 17:56.038
Right now she got stuck with
Vincent Jackson.

17:56.173 --> 17:58.875
Oh, Vincent Jackson. (groans)
He's so tall.

17:59.009 --> 18:01.878
She's been clamoring to get
Tavon Austin off of my squad.

18:02.012 --> 18:06.048
Now, that's a small dude.
He is small. Yes.

18:06.183 --> 18:08.468
It's funny you mention that.
He is kind of small.

18:08.602 --> 18:13.272
I love small.
Okay, Pete, I will talk about

18:13.390 --> 18:15.475
that trade with you.
Let's go ahead and just make

18:15.609 --> 18:19.479
it official right here. No, I, I
have no interest in, uh... Shake!

18:19.613 --> 18:21.814
Shake on it, shake!
Quite a trade.

18:21.949 --> 18:24.283
Oh, yeah!
Quite a trade.

18:24.401 --> 18:26.481
Good grip there, Jenny.
I just want to say thank you.

18:26.487 --> 18:28.371
And I want to say thank you,
sir.

18:28.489 --> 18:30.373
Oh, anytime.
Well, I'm happy.

18:30.491 --> 18:32.825
Great trade, Jenny. (laughs)
Would you like to dance?

18:32.960 --> 18:34.827
I'd love to.
Let's go.

18:34.962 --> 18:36.829
Have fun, guys.
Yeah.

18:36.964 --> 18:39.004
I got to hit the bathroom.
This U.T.I. is the worst.

18:39.049 --> 18:43.836
All right, just excuse
yourself that way, please.

18:43.971 --> 18:46.005
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Whoa! Closed!

18:46.140 --> 18:48.007
Andre, where are you taking me?

18:48.142 --> 18:50.009
Guys, I got to use the girl's
bathroom.

18:50.144 --> 18:52.011
No, no! No, Andre, don't!
No, Andre, no! No!

18:52.146 --> 18:57.650
Okay, I have an idea. Here. No! No! Oh,
my God! Oh, my God! Andre, stop it!

18:57.768 --> 18:58.828
Oh, my God! You're gonna get
arrested.

18:58.942 --> 19:00.826
It burns.
Ruxin?

19:00.944 --> 19:02.828
Wait, what's going on?
What-what are you showing me?

19:02.946 --> 19:06.031
Aw, middle school water fountain
forever unclean.

19:06.166 --> 19:10.035
Would you hurry up, please? You're gonna...
Okay, I'll go... You good?

19:10.203 --> 19:12.371
Oh, Mr. Lipscome!
How are you?

19:12.539 --> 19:14.373
MacArthur. Good.
Have you had an opportunity

19:14.541 --> 19:16.709
to meet Darren Sproles?
Oh! Oh, my God!

19:16.843 --> 19:20.713
Yes! Mr. Sproles, uh, Darren, it's such
an honor to meet you. How you doing?

19:20.847 --> 19:22.715
I'm a huge fan.
Well, thank you.

19:22.849 --> 19:24.717
I'm gonna go grab some water.
Uh, I can grab you a bottle

19:24.851 --> 19:26.731
of water over here.
Ah, no. Got a fountain right

19:26.853 --> 19:30.723
over here I can use. No! You cannot
use that water fountain! Why?

19:30.857 --> 19:33.025
No. Not for you.
There's a perfectly good

19:33.143 --> 19:35.894
fountain right there.
Wow, really-- the tiny water

19:36.029 --> 19:41.316
fountain? No, I didn't mean it like that.
Yeah, she did.

19:41.451 --> 19:43.736
You really got a problem with
short people, huh?

19:43.870 --> 19:45.821
No, I don't.
Oh, yes, she does.

19:45.955 --> 19:47.956
She's a height supremacist.
What? No!

19:48.074 --> 19:49.375
I love short people!
Come on, Darren, we don't

19:49.492 --> 19:50.793
need this.
Darren, I will play you next

19:50.910 --> 19:53.829
week even though you are mini
tiny tiny.

19:53.963 --> 19:55.831
God!
Great. Thank you.

19:55.965 --> 19:58.751
I got to pee again!
No, Yeast Mode!

19:59.721 --> 20:01.222
Well, at least Ellie's still
having a good time.

20:01.356 --> 20:03.224
That sucked.
Thanks a lot, Yeast Mode.

20:03.358 --> 20:05.392
It's not my fault.
I have a U.T.I. and a gluten

20:05.527 --> 20:07.611
allergy, thank you very much.
Can someone point me towards

20:07.729 --> 20:09.613
Jenny?
I want to see her suffer.

20:09.731 --> 20:12.283
Hi, Ruxin. How are you?
(Ruxin yells)

20:12.400 --> 20:15.870
Ah, gentlemen.
I have some huge Taco Corp news.

20:15.987 --> 20:18.122
Yeah? What's going on?
Taco Corp has officially

20:18.240 --> 20:25.676
sold the EBDB. Really? How much
you get for it? Uh, $1.1 million.

20:25.796 --> 20:27.847
What?
Mm-hmm.

20:27.965 --> 20:29.849
Wait, who gave you a million
dollars for that?

20:29.967 --> 20:32.185
It was my good friend Mark
from Cuba.

20:32.303 --> 20:36.105
Whoa.
Hey, Taco, what's cracking?

20:36.223 --> 20:40.226
Hey, Mark. How's Cuba? Wait, Mark
from Cuba is Mark Cuban? Duh.

20:40.361 --> 20:42.729
Yeah, how do you know Mark?
From <i> Shark Tank.</i>

20:42.897 --> 20:45.865
Taco, I love the EBDB, man.
I see it as a radical new

20:45.983 --> 20:47.734
platform in the social media
space.

20:47.868 --> 20:50.069
Bro, man, we got to incubate
this thing.

20:50.237 --> 20:52.398
Hey! That-That's what I said!
You should have invested,

20:52.456 --> 20:54.874
man, ha!
Oh, Pete! You could have

20:54.992 --> 20:57.744
made so much money if you'd
stuck with Taco Corp.

20:57.912 --> 20:59.913
(bleep) my life!
See you, bro.

21:00.080 --> 21:02.498
Hi, Mark, if I can, I have a
pitch.

21:02.633 --> 21:05.752
It's called Smooth-eHarmony and
it's a dating site and a

21:05.920 --> 21:08.054
smoothie service...
See you, Mark.

21:08.172 --> 21:10.423
Ah, it was a million dollar
idea.

21:10.557 --> 21:12.675
You know what?
Now that I have a bit of money,

21:12.810 --> 21:14.761
I think I will buy that house.
Yes, you should and I should

21:14.895 --> 21:16.763
absolutely be your real estate
agent.

21:16.897 --> 21:20.767
Yes. Mm, I don't think you're tall
enough for me.

21:20.901 --> 21:23.759
Does this place have a bathroom?
Yeah, it's behind the kiosk.

21:23.997 --> 21:25.280
Okay, good.
I go in the tire.
