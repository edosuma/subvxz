00:46.429 --> 00:48.097
Gentlemen!
Lock and load!

00:55.271 --> 00:58.842
Connie Kaminski, you're under arrest.
Show me your hands. Show 'em!

00:58.908 --> 01:01.110
<i>Yep, that's me.
Connie Kaminski.</i>

01:01.177 --> 01:02.579
<i>And holy shit, that was scary.</i>

01:02.645 --> 01:05.748
<i>I mean, I almost wet the bed.
I don't know why they didn't just knock.</i>

01:05.815 --> 01:09.819
<i>I mean, this is a story about coupons.
Little old coupons. They j...</i>

01:09.886 --> 01:13.189
<i>You know what? I should probably
start from the beginning.</i>

01:14.891 --> 01:16.559
<i>Hiya. Me again.</i>

01:16.626 --> 01:19.229
<i>Okay, yeah. This is
the perfect place to start.</i>

01:22.432 --> 01:24.400
<i>Here's a fun fact:</i>

01:24.467 --> 01:27.537
<i>I'm a three-time gold-medal-winning
Olympic racewalker.</i>

01:27.604 --> 01:30.406
<i>And you know what that's worth
out in the real world?</i>

01:30.473 --> 01:32.876
<i>Absolutely nothing.</i>

01:32.942 --> 01:35.745
<i>Did you know most Olympic
athletes aren't famous?</i>

01:35.812 --> 01:37.881
<i>And they sure as heck
aren't rich.</i>

01:37.947 --> 01:42.185
<i>Go ahead, look it up.
I mean, not now, but, you know, later.</i>

01:42.252 --> 01:45.555
<i>And, yeah, I may have retired,
but I don't quit.</i>

01:45.622 --> 01:48.825
<i>I figure no matter what you
do, give it all you got.</i>

01:48.892 --> 01:52.095
- <i>Hola.</i>
- <i>Hola,</i> Mrs. Flores.

01:52.762 --> 01:54.163
Do you have my coupons?

01:58.768 --> 02:00.837
Oh. Super-duper.

02:04.841 --> 02:05.942
Hey.

02:14.517 --> 02:16.386
You know what,

02:16.452 --> 02:19.289
you can never have
too much toilet paper, right?

02:19.355 --> 02:21.291
Okay, enjoy.

02:25.595 --> 02:28.665
You might wanna pack a jacket.
The weather showed rain in Cleveland.

02:28.731 --> 02:33.436
Oh, um, hey, did I just see you giving
the paper lady a bunch of stuff for free?

02:33.503 --> 02:35.538
Rick, she's barely getting by.

02:35.605 --> 02:37.941
Yeah, but at least
she has a job.

02:38.007 --> 02:40.577
And you are spending money
that we don't have.

02:40.643 --> 02:43.780
I am not spending money.
I am saving us money.

02:43.846 --> 02:45.648
- <i>This is my husband Rick.</i>
- You literally are.

02:45.715 --> 02:47.984
<i>He works for the IRS.</i>

02:48.051 --> 02:50.420
<i>And his job is to look
for people's mistakes.</i>

02:50.486 --> 02:51.588
I'll get it.

02:51.654 --> 02:53.389
What's this? Is this new?

02:54.057 --> 02:55.959
There's, like,
50 jugs of Tide.

02:56.025 --> 02:57.226
It's couponing 101.

02:57.293 --> 03:02.231
When Tide hits a six-month stock-up
price, you stock up, okay?

03:02.298 --> 03:06.336
That's 400 dollars' worth of
detergent that I got for $57.

03:06.402 --> 03:08.338
My mom used coupons...

03:08.404 --> 03:10.607
<i>We didn't always
argue about money.</i>

03:10.673 --> 03:13.343
<i>It was only after we tried
to start a family.</i>

03:13.409 --> 03:16.679
<i>And we tried.
And we tried.</i>

03:17.347 --> 03:18.615
<i>And we tried.</i>

03:19.482 --> 03:21.818
<i>And then, it finally happened.</i>

03:22.652 --> 03:25.288
<i>We were going to have a girl.</i>

03:25.355 --> 03:28.858
<i>But I just couldn't get
to the finish line.</i>

03:30.493 --> 03:35.732
<i>After that, for a while we
didn't argue about anything.</i>

03:35.798 --> 03:38.968
<i>Then Rick discovered
he could travel more for work.</i>

03:39.035 --> 03:41.904
<i>Now he's gone three weeks
out of every month.</i>

03:41.971 --> 03:43.406
<i>But that's okay.</i>

03:43.473 --> 03:44.974
<i>'Cause if that didn't happen,</i>

03:45.041 --> 03:47.443
<i>I might not have met
my best friend, JoJo.</i>

03:47.510 --> 03:51.381
Yo, yo, yo!
It's time to save with JoJo.

03:51.447 --> 03:54.884
Here is the thing
I love about coupons.

03:54.951 --> 03:58.354
I control my time,
I control my income,

03:58.421 --> 04:00.056
I control my life.

04:00.123 --> 04:02.659
So, JoJo's deal of the week
is right here...

04:02.725 --> 04:05.895
You sure as shit doing a good
job controlling your income.

04:05.962 --> 04:08.731
- Mom.
- 'Cause you ain't got no money.

04:08.798 --> 04:10.900
Stop. Mama, no. Stop it!

04:10.967 --> 04:13.936
You know I'm just... I'm over
here busy trying to build my brand

04:14.003 --> 04:15.972
as a successful entrepreneur.

04:16.039 --> 04:18.474
I'm my own CEO.

04:18.541 --> 04:22.312
CEO! What the F are you talking about?

04:22.378 --> 04:24.547
You nothing but a saleswoman
that don't make no sales.

04:24.614 --> 04:27.483
Yeah, Mama, that's a business.
Sometimes you don't make sale...

04:27.550 --> 04:28.885
You ever heard of Steve Jobs?

04:28.951 --> 04:30.787
What do you know
about a job?

04:30.853 --> 04:33.489
Okay, Mama. You be like that.
I'm going next door.

04:33.556 --> 04:35.892
Why you gotta spend
so much time with that girl?

04:35.958 --> 04:38.561
You and her carting around
all them food stamps.

04:38.628 --> 04:40.697
They're not food stamps.
They're coupons.

04:40.763 --> 04:42.598
White people use them.
Why can't we?

04:42.665 --> 04:44.867
Oh, so if white people
were jumping off a bridge...

04:44.934 --> 04:46.502
Oh, my gosh. Again.

04:46.569 --> 04:48.071
No, if white people
were jumping off a bridge,

04:48.137 --> 04:50.506
- I would not jump off a bridge.
- Why you got such a damn attitude?

04:50.573 --> 04:53.076
You're always talking about white people!
Like, no, of course not!

04:53.142 --> 04:54.911
Get on my nerves.

04:58.848 --> 05:02.085
Oh, hallelujah, praise the Lord.
Look who's here.

05:02.151 --> 05:04.754
- The savior of savings.
- What up, Rick Dick?

05:04.821 --> 05:06.689
Oh, hey,
I had a question for you.

05:06.756 --> 05:09.358
Um, has anybody
ever been happy to see you?

05:09.425 --> 05:12.128
Like, have you ever walked into
a room and someone's gone like,

05:12.195 --> 05:15.465
"Hey, everybody, look!
My cool IRS auditor just walked in"?

05:15.531 --> 05:17.100
- Yeah, they don't have to be happy.
- Oh, okay.

05:17.166 --> 05:19.068
I'm respected. I'm valued.

05:19.135 --> 05:20.536
Mmm.

05:20.603 --> 05:22.105
- I'm leaving.
- There you go.

05:22.171 --> 05:24.073
Those are the two words
we love to hear you say.

05:24.140 --> 05:25.975
All right, now. Bye, Rick.

05:26.042 --> 05:28.010
- Hey, Rick, I had one more question.
- Don't slam...

05:29.011 --> 05:31.147
- Hey, girl.
- Hiya, JoJo.

05:31.214 --> 05:35.418
All right,
I have got some stuff for you.

05:35.485 --> 05:36.886
- Look at all these.
- Oh, my gosh.

05:36.953 --> 05:38.821
- Big day.
- Big day.

05:44.060 --> 05:46.896
- Buy one, get one.
- BOGO!

05:46.963 --> 05:48.998
Rick should be happy
I taught you how to stockpile.

05:49.065 --> 05:51.801
Yeah, he doesn't get any of this.

05:51.868 --> 05:55.471
Oh, lookee. I only need
one more Colgate proof of purchase

05:55.538 --> 05:57.740
- to get a free AT&T gift card.
- You see that?

05:57.807 --> 06:01.544
You think Rick knows how to pay
a phone bill with toothpaste? No.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.613
You're winning.

06:03.679 --> 06:06.616
Hey, did you know that winning actually
changes the way your brain works?

06:06.682 --> 06:09.619
Like, every time you win,
you get a teensy bit smarter.

06:09.685 --> 06:11.487
They call it
the winner effect.

06:11.554 --> 06:15.124
You know, basically, the more you
win, the more you will win.

06:15.191 --> 06:16.759
Winning becomes habit.

06:18.761 --> 06:19.896
I really need a win.

06:31.507 --> 06:32.542
Yes!

06:53.196 --> 06:55.097
You doing okay today, Greg?

06:57.767 --> 07:00.736
You know,
I read that if you're lucky,

07:00.803 --> 07:04.207
you only get about 30,000 days
on planet Earth.

07:04.273 --> 07:05.875
- Right.
- That's not a lot.

07:07.043 --> 07:08.878
Maybe you should try
to make every day count.

07:08.945 --> 07:11.047
Total is $138.55.

07:12.915 --> 07:13.983
Is it?

07:14.050 --> 07:16.652
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

07:18.287 --> 07:20.690
It's like
a thousand coupons, man.

07:42.311 --> 07:46.916
Well, good for you, lady.
You saved $122.10.

07:46.983 --> 07:49.986
It is good for me, Greg.
It is good for me.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.855
"Watch the pennies, and the dollars
will take care of themselves."

07:52.922 --> 07:55.258
- All right.
- Sorry about the wait.

07:55.324 --> 07:57.526
Don't be.
That was impressive.

07:58.194 --> 07:59.228
Change.

08:01.697 --> 08:02.765
Your trophy.

08:33.696 --> 08:34.830
<i>"Dear General Mills,</i>

08:34.897 --> 08:36.799
<i>I recently purchased
a box of Wheaties cereal</i>

08:36.866 --> 08:39.335
<i>from my local A&G Family Mart
here in Phoenix.</i>

08:39.402 --> 08:43.706
<i>When I opened it, I discovered,
to my chagrin, that the cereal was stale.</i>

08:43.773 --> 08:47.143
<i>As a former Olympic athlete,
I was very disappointed.</i>

08:47.209 --> 08:49.578
<i>'Breakfast of champions'?</i>

08:49.645 --> 08:52.949
<i>With cereal this stale,
it's more like 'breakfast of chump-ions.'"</i>

08:53.015 --> 08:56.252
No shade, but, um, we both know
the before we were working with.

08:56.319 --> 08:58.321
But why don't you
take a little look

08:58.387 --> 09:01.924
- at the after!
- Oh, my God!

09:01.991 --> 09:04.627
- Wow.
- Yes, girl! Look at you!

09:04.694 --> 09:08.297
Who is that?
Is that Halle Berry from 2002?

09:09.732 --> 09:11.067
So what I've used here

09:11.133 --> 09:14.003
is the Back-2-Black
executive package.

09:14.070 --> 09:17.239
I try to tell people, like, that
white-girl makeup does not work for us.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.374
You know what I mean? Okay.

09:18.441 --> 09:20.176
- Mm-hmm.
- You need your own stuff.

09:20.242 --> 09:23.346
So, do we have a sale?

09:23.412 --> 09:24.947
Do you take credit cards?

09:25.014 --> 09:27.116
Unfortunately,
I can only accept cash.

09:27.183 --> 09:29.685
I have a history
with identity theft.

09:29.752 --> 09:31.988
- What?
- No. Girl. No, no, no.

09:32.054 --> 09:34.757
No, I did not steal
anybody's identity. No way.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.859
I had my identity stolen.

09:36.926 --> 09:38.894
My credit's trash.
I can't even walk into a bank.

09:38.961 --> 09:40.396
- Mmm.
- It's a whole thing. You don't even need

09:40.463 --> 09:42.398
to worry
about that right now, so...

09:43.699 --> 09:45.034
I need to think about it.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.763
Fun trip?

10:13.829 --> 10:16.165
Fun? What's fun about work?

10:16.232 --> 10:20.703
Hey, what do you say we go out for
a nice dinner tonight? Maybe sushi?

10:20.770 --> 10:22.171
Sushi's expensive.

10:22.238 --> 10:24.173
Didn't you say you had
some kinda coupon thing

10:24.240 --> 10:25.341
from TGI Fridays?

10:27.109 --> 10:29.178
Mm-hmm.

10:29.245 --> 10:32.148
<i>Looks like the
Arizona fans will stay on their feet</i>

10:32.214 --> 10:35.918
<i>as Harris steps to the plate
with a chance to tie it up.</i>

10:35.985 --> 10:40.156
<i>Pitch... Oh, inside!
And near his head.</i>

10:50.399 --> 10:52.334
- Earl!
- Hey there, JoJo.

10:52.401 --> 10:55.071
You better not have a bunch
of bills in there for me.

10:55.137 --> 10:56.972
Ugh. Oof.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.075
- You got this?
- Oh.

10:59.141 --> 11:02.778
- I don't know nothing about this.
- Okay. Damn.

11:02.845 --> 11:05.381
- Oh, I loved your new YouTube video, JoJo.
- Oh, yeah?

11:05.448 --> 11:08.451
Yeah. You know, I keep asking
myself, "How does she do it?"

11:08.517 --> 11:09.985
It's like
you can read my mind.

11:10.052 --> 11:11.887
That's 'cause I can.
Come here.

11:11.954 --> 11:14.023
I'm gonna tell you what you're thinking.
Look at me.

11:22.031 --> 11:23.432
Oh. Uh...

11:23.499 --> 11:25.501
- Oh, boy.
- I'm just playing with you, Earl.

11:25.568 --> 11:27.770
- I can't tell what you're thinking.
- I should be going.

11:27.837 --> 11:28.938
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:32.241 --> 11:33.309
Bye!

11:41.317 --> 11:44.487
I'm leaving. I'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

11:44.553 --> 11:45.754
Mm-hmm.

11:47.423 --> 11:48.824
You had a choice.

11:48.891 --> 11:53.195
We could've been eating out at
expensive and fancy places all the time.

11:53.262 --> 11:58.067
Instead, you chose four
rounds of IVF treatments.

11:58.134 --> 12:01.137
You knew I wanted to quit
after one, but...

12:02.938 --> 12:05.508
You're trying to replace
what you lost with coupons.

12:05.574 --> 12:08.878
Are you kidding me right now?
We lost a baby.

12:09.512 --> 12:11.814
Get out of this room.

12:12.081 --> 12:13.182
And get a job.

12:22.358 --> 12:24.126
Mail's here.

13:00.663 --> 13:02.598
<i>Oh, my...</i>

13:06.368 --> 13:07.636
See that, Greg?

13:07.703 --> 13:09.972
"Watch the pennies, and the dollars
will take care of themselves."

13:10.039 --> 13:11.907
Why do you always say that?

13:11.974 --> 13:14.376
'Cause it's the little things
that matter.

13:14.443 --> 13:16.512
Mmm. Little things.

13:16.579 --> 13:19.381
Like wasting your time writing
a stupid complaint letter?

13:19.448 --> 13:22.251
- How did you know that?
- You're not special.

13:22.318 --> 13:25.988
They always send you coupons for free
shit when you bitch to the manufacturer.

13:41.604 --> 13:45.407
<i>"Fifty percent less fat?
More like 100% less flavor."</i>

13:45.474 --> 13:47.409
<i>"How about new

13:47.476 --> 13:50.012
<i>"Your trash bags are garbage."</i>

13:50.079 --> 13:52.014
<i>"Your cookie isn't soft,

<i>"If you meant for the cheese
flavor to taste like feet,</i>

13:56.485 --> 13:58.954
<i>then bravo, my friend,
you nailed it."</i>

14:31.553 --> 14:34.189
- Okay, don't... don't peek. Okay.
- Okay.

14:35.190 --> 14:36.292
Okay, open.

14:37.426 --> 14:40.696
What? No, Connie!

14:40.763 --> 14:41.530
You told me
you wrote that letter

14:41.597 --> 14:43.499
- 'cause your cereal was stale.
- Yeah.

14:43.565 --> 14:45.701
So, what, the whole fucking
house has gone stale?

14:46.468 --> 14:48.370
- Not exactly...
- Oh, shit!

14:48.437 --> 14:50.039
- You got Cottonelle Ultra?
- Yeah.

14:50.105 --> 14:52.408
- You got 36 family rolls for free?
- Yeah.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.476
That coupon's worth,
like, 40 bucks.

14:54.543 --> 14:57.012
Well, you can get one too.
Just write a letter to Cottonelle.

14:57.079 --> 14:58.614
And say what?
"Dear Cottonelle,

14:58.681 --> 15:01.216
your supersoft toilet paper
scratched up my ass"?

15:01.283 --> 15:02.685
Please,
they're not gonna believe me!

15:02.751 --> 15:05.220
Or, better yet,
just pay me for the coupon.

15:05.287 --> 15:07.323
Okay.

15:07.389 --> 15:10.192
Actually, how much would you pay
me for this Cottonelle coupon?

15:10.259 --> 15:12.695
Would you pay maybe half
of what it's worth?

15:12.761 --> 15:15.364
Twenty bucks? Yeah, why not?

15:15.431 --> 15:18.434
So you'd give me 20 bucks for
this coupon that I got for free?

15:18.500 --> 15:21.170
That's quite a profit,
don't you think?

15:21.236 --> 15:24.273
Imagine if we got more of these,
and we sold them to people for half.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.675
That would...
That'd be a real business.

15:28.143 --> 15:30.279
How is that a real business?

15:30.346 --> 15:34.049
Even if you wanted to,
how would you ever get enough to sell?

15:34.116 --> 15:37.086
I think I know where
we can get 'em in bulk.

15:37.152 --> 15:41.023
Advanced Solutions works with
the top Fortune 500 companies

15:41.090 --> 15:43.325
to handle all of
your coupon printing needs.

15:43.392 --> 15:46.462
<i>Each week, when customers
redeem your coupons,</i>

15:46.528 --> 15:50.032
<i>they'll be sent back to our
Advanced Solutions printing facility</i>

15:50.099 --> 15:53.135
<i>and coupon clearinghouse
in Chihuahua, Mexico.</i>

15:54.503 --> 15:57.005
Chihuahua, Mexico.
That's not far from here.

15:57.072 --> 15:58.741
Okay, Chihuahua.
What's your point?

15:58.807 --> 16:00.542
That's where
all the coupons are.

16:00.609 --> 16:02.144
So what,
you want to rob the place?

16:02.211 --> 16:03.579
- No.
- Oh.

16:03.645 --> 16:08.150
No, no. Not rob. Just remove
or just separate some.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.619
No. No. Uh-uh.
Are you crazy?

16:10.686 --> 16:12.755
JoJo, I need you.

16:12.821 --> 16:15.090
There's no one better
at selling people stuff.

16:15.157 --> 16:16.358
Then how come I'm so broke?

16:16.425 --> 16:19.461
Yeah. Exactly. It's not fair.

16:19.528 --> 16:22.598
Like, all you wanted
was a successful business.

16:22.664 --> 16:26.735
But because someone ruined your
credit, you can never fix that?

16:26.802 --> 16:28.537
And all I wanted was a baby,

16:28.604 --> 16:31.540
and I... now I gotta pay
for that the rest of my life?

16:31.607 --> 16:33.809
No one is gonna help us.

16:33.876 --> 16:35.744
You know who gets rewarded?

16:35.811 --> 16:38.514
People who don't follow
the rules.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.716
It's time we start
bending 'em a little.

16:44.319 --> 16:46.688
I want you to know you don't
have to keep selling me on it,

16:46.755 --> 16:48.590
- 'cause I'm in.
- I'm just saying,

16:48.657 --> 16:51.126
you know, you lodge one complaint,
they send you a free coupon.

16:51.193 --> 16:53.395
- They're handing them out like hot cakes.
- Mm-hmm.

16:53.462 --> 16:55.731
And... And we're just
taking a few extra.

16:55.798 --> 16:57.533
Mmm.
Well, we're stealing them.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.168
And all we're doing is
making them more accessible.

16:59.234 --> 17:00.669
- By smuggling them.
- That...

17:00.736 --> 17:03.405
Honestly, these companies
make bazillions of dollars,

17:03.472 --> 17:06.541
so it's not like they're gonna
miss a couple of coupons.

17:06.608 --> 17:12.281
I'm just telling you that it is stealing,
smuggling and selling illegally.

17:12.347 --> 17:14.550
It sounds bad
when you say it like that.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.085
- It is bad, girl.
- Well, don't say it like that.

17:17.152 --> 17:18.487
It doesn't have to sound bad.

17:18.554 --> 17:20.556
I think it's gonna be good.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.124
No, it's gonna be good.

17:22.191 --> 17:25.093
It's gonna be good.
I can feel it.

17:29.865 --> 17:31.733
Hey, congratulations, Sunil.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.302
Congrats on being
a grandfather.

17:33.368 --> 17:35.471
- Thank you.
- Not everybody's got a...

17:36.438 --> 17:38.607
Not everybody's got a family.

17:38.674 --> 17:40.542
<i>Attention, shoppers.
If you have our club card,</i>

17:40.609 --> 17:43.846
<i>you can save 10% today
in our deli department.</i>

17:43.912 --> 17:46.381
<i>Get 10% off today
in the deli department...</i>

17:47.749 --> 17:49.618
- No, just...
- It's still not working.

17:49.685 --> 17:52.387
Yeah, I see that.
Just punch it in manually

17:52.454 --> 17:55.858
- and give her the coupon price.
- Dave. Dave. Hold on. Wait.

17:55.924 --> 17:59.361
Can I... Can I take a look at that
before you make the transaction?

17:59.428 --> 18:01.330
- Before you punch it in.
- Sorry, folks.

18:01.396 --> 18:04.466
We're just gonna be a minute.
Alice will help you on one.

18:04.533 --> 18:07.202
Yeah. No. This is,
uh, this is not a real coupon.

18:07.269 --> 18:08.837
I-I don't understand.

18:08.904 --> 18:10.305
It's a fake, ma'am.

18:10.372 --> 18:12.608
How is it fake?
Look, uh, who are you?

18:13.375 --> 18:14.910
I am, uh, Ken Miller.

18:14.977 --> 18:16.645
I'm the loss prevention
officer

18:16.712 --> 18:19.515
for all the A&G Family Marts
across the Southwest.

18:19.581 --> 18:22.217
You're lucky I was here today
to spot this little guy.

18:22.284 --> 18:25.354
Take a look here.
See that expiration date?

18:25.420 --> 18:27.890
Does that look familiar
to you? November 31st?

18:27.956 --> 18:31.426
It shouldn't. There's only 30
days in the month of November.

18:31.493 --> 18:33.629
So whoever tried to replicate
this little guy,

18:33.695 --> 18:35.497
clearly, they didn't look
at a calendar.

18:35.564 --> 18:36.932
Probably out of China.

18:36.999 --> 18:39.501
You know, they screw up the dates
all the time. There's always a flaw.

18:39.568 --> 18:41.937
You know, if you know what to look
for, it's easy to spot.

18:42.004 --> 18:44.373
Well, can you just make
an exception?

18:44.439 --> 18:46.842
I mean, we could just honor
it, Ken, this one time.

18:46.909 --> 18:49.711
She's been coming here
for, like, 150 years.

18:49.778 --> 18:52.748
Yeah, I don't care if she's
Dame Judi Dench, Dave.

18:52.814 --> 18:54.883
You leave the food out,
the critters will get it.

18:54.950 --> 18:56.885
This is how this starts.
I'm just saying.

18:56.952 --> 18:59.288
Sorry to compare you to rodents, ma'am.
I didn't mean that.

18:59.354 --> 19:02.524
I just mean to say that rules are rules.
But if it helps, I...

19:02.591 --> 19:05.427
If it helps?
I have hemorrhoids.

19:05.494 --> 19:08.430
You know what helps, honey?
Preparation H.

19:08.497 --> 19:10.666
Well, we're happy to sell
it to ya at full price.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.401
Well,
then why don't you buy it?

19:12.467 --> 19:14.369
Because you're
a giant asshole!

19:17.506 --> 19:19.408
That's a good one, ma'am.

19:19.474 --> 19:22.578
But as Dave will attest,
I've been told that before.

19:24.179 --> 19:26.915
You should put that in the burn pile.
See you, Dave. I'll be back next month.

19:29.785 --> 19:34.256
Hey, sorry. Um, would you mind if we
switched seats, just for this last part?

19:34.323 --> 19:36.925
She really likes to watch
out the window as we land.

19:36.992 --> 19:39.628
- And it helps calm her down.
- Mmm. Yeah.

19:39.695 --> 19:41.930
No, even if
I wanted to switch,

19:41.997 --> 19:46.768
I think it's more important that your
daughter learn a valuable lesson.

19:46.835 --> 19:50.906
That's not how the world works, you know.
You don't always get your way.

19:50.973 --> 19:54.910
- Are you for real, dude?
- Okay.

20:33.448 --> 20:37.052
Fuck!

20:38.987 --> 20:40.455
Fuck.

20:50.732 --> 20:53.502
So, what, we're just gonna
eeny, meeny, miny, mo,

20:53.568 --> 20:57.406
pick some random dude and be
like, "Could you steal for us?"

20:58.373 --> 21:00.942
Yeah.
We need someone on the inside.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.045
We need an inside man.

21:03.111 --> 21:06.415
Ooh, what about that guy? He
looks like that badass dude from <i>Machete.</i>

21:06.481 --> 21:08.917
- Too sketchy.
- We want sketchy.

21:08.984 --> 21:11.920
We want him to help us,
not chop us up into tiny pieces.

21:11.987 --> 21:14.790
What about this Cesar
Millan-looking motherfucker?

21:15.457 --> 21:16.525
Too square.

21:19.928 --> 21:21.863
We need that guy.

21:21.930 --> 21:24.332
That guy?
Why that guy?

21:24.399 --> 21:26.601
'Cause he's already
bending the rules.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.641
Look at that. We got two
for the price of one.

21:33.475 --> 21:35.343
- BOGO.
- BOGO.

21:35.410 --> 21:37.879
Are you interested in a way
to make some more money?

21:37.946 --> 21:40.415
No, that sounds creepy.
Just be like, "Oh, hey, we have a"...

21:40.482 --> 21:41.983
- We have a business opportunity for you.
- Yes, yes.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.552
- Okay. That's better.
- That's it, that's it.

21:47.956 --> 21:50.759
- Okay. Here goes nothing.
- All right.

21:56.098 --> 21:57.399
Why is she running?

21:57.466 --> 21:59.134
- Shit! Shit, shit.
- Oh, my God. Wait!

22:01.570 --> 22:03.371
We have money. Money.
Dinero. Dinero. We have it!

22:05.841 --> 22:08.043
No! Dinero. We have dinero for you.
We have it.

22:08.110 --> 22:09.911
For you, yeah.

22:09.978 --> 22:11.880
- For me? Oh.
- Yeah, man. Yeah.

22:19.454 --> 22:21.389
What is she doing?

22:21.456 --> 22:23.391
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!
- Oh, no, no, no!

22:23.458 --> 22:25.927
Stop! What...

22:25.994 --> 22:27.429
Alejandro!

22:27.496 --> 22:29.397
These women
are trying to help us.

22:32.033 --> 22:33.668
- Uh.
- It's okay. It's okay.

22:33.735 --> 22:35.403
Oh!

22:38.740 --> 22:40.542
Okay, here we go.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.478
- Hi.
- Mmm.

22:44.646 --> 22:47.816
Okay, here we go.
You good? Okay, here we go.

22:50.485 --> 22:54.890
You never trail someone
in Mexico. Ever.

22:54.956 --> 22:56.158
You <i>estúpida.</i>

23:00.629 --> 23:03.832
My... My wife is angry.
But she's right.

23:03.899 --> 23:05.700
She is angry.

23:05.767 --> 23:08.436
And also... pregnant?

23:08.503 --> 23:11.873
- It is very early. But yes.
- Oh, wow.

23:11.940 --> 23:13.942
Minimum wage
is only two dollars an hour.

23:14.009 --> 23:16.077
Do you really have a way
for us to make some money?

23:16.144 --> 23:19.915
Wait, your wage is two dollars an hour?

23:19.981 --> 23:22.150
That's a crime.
You gotta talk to somebody about that.

23:22.217 --> 23:24.052
I should talk to my boss
and ask for a raise?

23:24.119 --> 23:25.587
- Yes.
- Yes.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.889
Yes, you should definitely
talk to your boss.

23:27.956 --> 23:30.659
Are you crazy?
This company's American.

23:30.725 --> 23:33.728
They only moved here so they
could take advantage of us.

23:33.795 --> 23:36.164
That's all the more reason
you should hear us out.

23:38.166 --> 23:42.504
These coupons. They all come
from your factory, yes?

23:42.571 --> 23:44.806
<i>Sí, sí,</i>
we make all kinds of coupons.

23:44.873 --> 23:48.476
We don't need all kinds.
Just the ones for free stuff.

23:48.543 --> 23:49.778
Can you get more of these?

23:50.712 --> 23:52.814
Are you asking me to steal?

23:52.881 --> 23:59.688
Again, everyone is making it sound so
bad, but it's...

23:59.754 --> 24:01.223
- Technically, yes.
- Yeah.

24:01.289 --> 24:03.258
- Uh.
- Okay, okay.

24:03.325 --> 24:05.126
It's like Robin Hood, okay?

24:05.193 --> 24:07.996
You are gonna take these
coupons from this company

24:08.063 --> 24:09.998
that pays you chump change,

24:10.065 --> 24:12.601
and then we're gonna get them to
families who really need them.

24:12.667 --> 24:15.670
She's right. Do you have any idea
how expensive diapers are?

24:15.737 --> 24:18.240
And, obviously,
you would be sharing in the profits.

24:18.306 --> 24:20.609
- Yeah.
- <i>La puta's</i> right.

24:20.675 --> 24:25.013
But we don't need your Robin Hood.
We have Jesús Malverde.

24:25.080 --> 24:27.816
He took from the rich
and gave to the poor families.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.151
We will follow
in his footsteps.

24:30.218 --> 24:33.722
Okay, yeah. Go with him. I mean,
this dude is dope as hell. I love it.

24:33.788 --> 24:34.990
Rosa, no.

24:49.237 --> 24:51.039
A wise man once said,

24:51.106 --> 24:55.777
"Family is not an important thing.
It is everything."

24:55.844 --> 24:58.013
Was that Jesús Malverde
as well?

24:58.079 --> 25:01.683
It is the words
of Michael J. Fox.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.084
Michael J. Fox?

25:04.085 --> 25:06.054
The damn actor?

25:06.121 --> 25:08.790
- Like, Marty McFly?
- Doesn't matter who said it, JoJo.

25:08.857 --> 25:09.858
He's right.

25:10.725 --> 25:12.294
Michael J. Fox is right.

25:20.201 --> 25:22.837
Okay.

25:22.904 --> 25:24.339
- Yes.
- Yes?

25:24.406 --> 25:25.974
- I will do it.
- You will?

25:26.041 --> 25:29.077
For real?
Like for... Oh. Oh, wow.

25:29.144 --> 25:31.947
I mean, 'cause it took me a while
to get on board, and I know her.

25:32.013 --> 25:34.082
You are ready, huh?

25:34.149 --> 25:36.017
And here is how we will do it.

25:36.084 --> 25:39.721
<i>The factory is split in two.
Printing and redemption.</i>

25:39.788 --> 25:43.792
<i>And the right hand does not
know what the left hand does.</i>

25:43.858 --> 25:46.728
<i>Rosa works on
the coupon redemption side.</i>

25:46.795 --> 25:50.999
<i>All day counting used coupons,
very tedious.</i>

25:51.066 --> 25:53.268
<i>And I work on the print side.</i>

25:53.335 --> 25:57.005
<i>It is man's work.
Heavy lifting, dangerous.</i>

25:57.072 --> 26:00.675
- Just get to the point.
- Don't boss me.

26:01.443 --> 26:03.244
Anyway.

26:03.311 --> 26:07.015
<i>With each coupon we print,
there is always extra.</i>

26:07.082 --> 26:10.018
<i>Even with the free coupons.</i>

26:10.085 --> 26:14.055
<i>It is normal for us to destroy
these extra coupons.</i>

26:15.390 --> 26:17.058
But no more.

26:17.125 --> 26:19.728
Oh, Alejandro,
you very sexy right now.

26:21.129 --> 26:23.398
Instead,
I will send them to you.

26:23.465 --> 26:26.368
<i>Our trucks ship coupons
all across the US.</i>

26:26.434 --> 26:29.270
<i>And as for the border,
this is no problem.</i>

26:29.337 --> 26:32.774
<i>They stop drugs because
there is a war on drugs.</i>

26:33.375 --> 26:35.343
<i>But who cares about coupons?</i>

26:40.849 --> 26:42.017
<i>Gracias.</i>

26:48.123 --> 26:50.425
Okay, Mama,
just please be quiet, okay?

26:50.492 --> 26:53.294
I ain't saying a word.

26:53.361 --> 26:56.931
Yo, yo, yo.
It's time to save with JoJo.

26:56.998 --> 27:00.068
Is it hot in here,
or is it just me?

27:00.135 --> 27:01.770
It's you.

27:02.404 --> 27:04.005
I have to start again now!

27:04.072 --> 27:06.741
<i>I'm getting my Cheetos fix</i>

27:06.808 --> 27:10.879
thanks to my flamin' hot site
for coupons,

27:10.945 --> 27:13.281
savvysupersaver.com.

27:13.348 --> 27:16.951
<i>You get a bunch of coupons.
All of them are gonna be half off, okay?</i>

27:17.018 --> 27:20.955
So, go there, get your coupons,
make your savings, okay?

27:30.331 --> 27:31.866
$47.99.

27:32.467 --> 27:34.135
Whoa, look at that. Free!

27:41.142 --> 27:42.143
Okay.

27:48.316 --> 27:51.019
- Hey, I got it.
- Thank you, Earl.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.388
Savvy Super Saver, huh?

27:54.456 --> 27:57.792
<i>Now, did I say save,
or did I say save?</i>

27:57.859 --> 28:00.161
<i>You get a free coupon!
You get a free coupon!</i>

28:00.228 --> 28:01.463
<i>You get a free coupon!</i>

28:16.344 --> 28:17.979
Keep an eye on that for me,
okay?

28:34.229 --> 28:37.031
Okay.

28:37.098 --> 28:41.002
<i>You have 74 new
voice messages. First voice message.</i>

28:41.069 --> 28:42.837
<i>I'm calling from General Mills</i>

28:42.904 --> 28:46.107
<i>about a fraudulent, um, uh,
coupon for Cocoa Puffs.</i>

28:46.174 --> 28:47.442
<i>Coupon for Cocoa Puffs.</i>

28:47.509 --> 28:49.511
<i>That sounds funny, I guess.
Anyway...</i>

28:49.577 --> 28:51.212
<i>There's
been a run on Schick razors.</i>

28:51.279 --> 28:53.781
<i>In the past month,
this one counterfeit coupon</i>

28:53.848 --> 28:56.217
<i>has cost us hundreds of
thousands of dollars.</i>

28:56.284 --> 28:59.521
<i>Uh, we've
had, uh, several of your A&G stores</i>

28:59.587 --> 29:02.423
<i>attempting to redeem this counterfeit
coupon for Huggies diapers.</i>

29:02.490 --> 29:04.125
- There's no flaw.
- <i>If you're looking at</i>

29:04.192 --> 29:05.860
<i>these redemption numbers,</i>

29:05.927 --> 29:07.896
<i>this is quickly becoming
a serious issue.</i>

29:07.962 --> 29:10.064
<i>Which is why we're
calling on all LPOs</i>

29:10.131 --> 29:12.867
<i>to look into
these fraudulent Tide coupons.</i>

29:12.934 --> 29:14.335
<i>This is code red.</i>

29:14.402 --> 29:16.004
- <i>I've mailed you...</i>
- There's no flaw.

29:16.070 --> 29:17.839
<i>...of the fraudulent coupon.
If Gerber didn't...</i>

29:17.906 --> 29:21.843
<i>Eleven days. No sleep.
Just me and the receipts.</i>

29:21.910 --> 29:25.413
<i>On a diet of coffee
and heartburn.</i>

29:25.480 --> 29:29.517
<i>The key was finding discounts that
matched the coupons in question.</i>

29:30.285 --> 29:32.053
<i>It was no small task.</i>

29:32.120 --> 29:35.356
Aha! Yes!

29:35.423 --> 29:37.559
<i>Then, accessing
our financial database,</i>

29:37.625 --> 29:41.362
I was able to trace the credit
card number back to you, back here.

29:41.429 --> 29:42.830
And here we are today.

29:42.897 --> 29:44.599
But you're not a detective.

29:44.666 --> 29:47.368
'Cause you sort of look
like a detective.

29:47.435 --> 29:50.104
Detective...
Do I look like a detective?

29:50.171 --> 29:53.341
Huh. I'll pocket that
compliment for a rainy day.

29:53.408 --> 29:57.111
I, uh, no,
I work for A&G Family Mart.

29:57.178 --> 30:00.048
Anyways, let's cut to
the Chevy Chase here.

30:00.114 --> 30:02.584
If I ask a question,
just assume I know the answer.

30:02.650 --> 30:04.953
So, stick to the facts,
would you, ma'am?

30:05.019 --> 30:07.121
Spill it.
Where'd you get the coupons?

30:07.188 --> 30:09.123
Uh, okay.

30:09.190 --> 30:13.127
Well, a friend sent me this video
of this Black woman going on and on

30:13.194 --> 30:15.129
about all this stuff
she got for half off

30:15.196 --> 30:18.533
with these coupons
from some website.

30:18.600 --> 30:20.101
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna stop you there.

30:20.168 --> 30:23.037
You purchased these coupons
off a website?

30:23.104 --> 30:26.241
Do you have any idea how many
Cheerios a one-year-old goes through?

30:26.307 --> 30:27.976
Well, what's the name
of this website?

30:28.042 --> 30:32.280
Uh, Super Snappy Saver?

30:32.347 --> 30:35.149
Super Snazzy something.

30:35.216 --> 30:37.418
- Snazzy Super Saver.
- Uh...

30:37.485 --> 30:39.921
I remember thinking,
"What a dumb name."

30:39.988 --> 30:42.457
Yeah. Sp-Speedy Shopper?
Could that be it?

30:42.523 --> 30:44.225
Speedy Shopper?
No. That's not even close.

30:44.292 --> 30:46.027
Well, I'm trying
to be helpful.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.595
You said you already knew the answers.

30:47.662 --> 30:49.964
- I-I know a lot of 'em, but the point...
- One minute.

30:58.539 --> 31:00.541
Savvy!

31:00.608 --> 31:03.244
S... Are you talking to me,
ma'am?

31:03.311 --> 31:04.612
Savvy Super Saver.

31:04.679 --> 31:06.914
Savvy, is that one V or two?

31:06.981 --> 31:10.018
Oh, no, I guess one would be
"savy." So it's two. Two V's.

31:14.255 --> 31:17.058
"Watch the pennies, and the dollars
will take care of themselves."

31:17.125 --> 31:20.662
Savvy Super Saver.

31:24.565 --> 31:26.067
My hands hurt.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.236
We're filling
hundreds of orders a day.

31:28.303 --> 31:30.705
Don't you feel like this is
all happening way too fast?

31:30.772 --> 31:33.374
No, fast is good. Fast is...

31:34.375 --> 31:36.177
- Oh, crap.
- What?

31:36.244 --> 31:39.347
Frozen? No. No.

31:39.414 --> 31:42.583
Connie, I told you this
is all happening too fast!

31:42.650 --> 31:44.552
I'm like,
"Whoop, whoop, whoop!"

31:44.619 --> 31:46.521
Alarm bells
are just going off in my mind.

31:46.587 --> 31:47.955
- Let me refresh it.
- So just...

31:48.022 --> 31:49.390
Okay, close the page.
Start again.

31:49.457 --> 31:50.658
Did we lose all that money?

31:50.725 --> 31:52.660
- I don't know.
- Fuck!

31:52.727 --> 31:54.962
Uh-huh.

31:55.029 --> 31:57.632
Uh-huh, yep. So...

31:57.699 --> 32:02.403
Abnormally large amounts of money
in the account. Right.

32:02.470 --> 32:05.640
Okay, and... and how do we unfreeze it?

32:07.675 --> 32:09.577
Uh-huh.

32:09.644 --> 32:12.747
Oh, so we just have to prove
that it's a legitimate business.

32:12.814 --> 32:15.983
Okay. Got it.

32:16.050 --> 32:17.752
Yes.

32:17.819 --> 32:21.022
All good. Okay. Okey dokey.
Thanks so much. Bye.

32:21.723 --> 32:23.991
I knew this was
too good to be true.

32:24.058 --> 32:25.526
Is it though?

32:25.593 --> 32:28.496
The PayPal rep
made it seem simple enough.

32:28.563 --> 32:31.199
We just need someone who's had
experience with this sort of thing.

32:31.265 --> 32:34.635
Like selling stolen shit for
abnormally large amounts of money.

32:34.702 --> 32:36.337
- Like that sort of thing?
- Exactly.

32:36.404 --> 32:39.540
Oh, okay.

32:39.607 --> 32:41.776
What about that girl
who stole your identity?

32:41.843 --> 32:44.345
Tempe Tina? Really?

32:44.412 --> 32:48.182
You wanna go to the little
brat who ruined my entire life?

32:49.684 --> 32:51.319
JoJo...

32:51.386 --> 32:53.554
- Girl, this is unnecessary.
- I know, but we need her.

32:53.621 --> 32:54.455
What the fuck
is this about?

32:54.522 --> 32:56.290
Just to clear the air,

32:56.357 --> 32:59.026
the shit I did to you as a
kid, that was a side gig, okay.

32:59.093 --> 33:00.795
I dabble in the dark web.

33:00.862 --> 33:04.565
Okay, well, just to clear the
air on my side, just so you know,

33:04.632 --> 33:07.668
after that little stunt you
pulled, I went to the police.

33:07.735 --> 33:09.470
- They didn't help me.
- That's true.

33:09.537 --> 33:11.606
I went to social security.
They didn't believe me.

33:11.672 --> 33:13.608
And I went to my bank.
And guess what?

33:13.674 --> 33:15.610
Those motherfuckers
didn't trust me.

33:15.676 --> 33:18.579
Girl, you know,
I had so much debt because of you.

33:18.646 --> 33:20.481
I had to move back home
with my mama.

33:20.548 --> 33:24.085
You know how embarrassing that shit is?
I'm a grown-ass woman.

33:24.152 --> 33:25.653
I'm really sorry about that.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.655
I-I really... I had no idea.

33:27.722 --> 33:29.157
Yeah, well, okay.

33:29.690 --> 33:32.059
- Electric car?
- What?

33:32.126 --> 33:35.329
Is this an electric car?
It's just so quiet, isn't it?

33:35.396 --> 33:37.198
I mean, I've never been
blindfolded before,

33:37.265 --> 33:39.066
and it's true what they say.

33:39.133 --> 33:41.436
All your other senses
are so heightened.

33:42.403 --> 33:44.338
Ooh...

33:44.405 --> 33:46.207
- Did we just go over train tracks?
- I felt that.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.742
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah.

33:47.809 --> 33:50.111
- They are heightened, I...
- That's so weird.

33:50.178 --> 33:52.647
Are you eating Juicy Fruit?
The gum. Is that what you eatin'?

33:52.713 --> 33:54.615
You smell that?
Oh, I love Juicy Fruit.

33:54.682 --> 33:57.318
- Oh, I haven't had it in forever.
- Me either. Me either.

33:57.385 --> 33:58.786
Can you guys
just shut the fuck up?

33:58.853 --> 34:00.154
Okay, rude.

34:00.221 --> 34:02.123
My specialty
is cybersecurity.

34:02.190 --> 34:04.559
You guys have any idea
what that means?

34:04.625 --> 34:05.860
- No. Not a clue.
- No.

34:05.927 --> 34:08.463
Okay. Governments
and global corporations

34:08.529 --> 34:11.331
deal with security attacks
every single day.

34:11.399 --> 34:14.302
My job is to identify 'em,
prevent 'em,

34:14.368 --> 34:18.139
or, if they pay me enough,
to create 'em.

34:19.774 --> 34:21.342
Humblebrag.

34:25.813 --> 34:28.649
How the fuck did you
make this kind of coin from coupons?

34:28.716 --> 34:29.750
Take 'em off.

34:30.551 --> 34:32.320
Whew.

34:32.386 --> 34:34.222
You can't have this much money
flowing in a single account.

34:34.288 --> 34:36.657
I can unfreeze this for you,
but we gotta spread this shit out.

34:36.724 --> 34:39.694
I'm talking MoneyPak, PayPal,
Venmo, Google Pay.

34:42.429 --> 34:44.431
Okay, wow.

34:44.498 --> 34:46.567
You're cashing in
with this craptacular site,

34:46.634 --> 34:48.168
Savvy Super Saver?

34:48.235 --> 34:50.471
- It was a template.
- Right.

34:50.538 --> 34:53.241
And the site isn't savvy,
the shoppers are.

34:53.306 --> 34:54.408
There we go. That part.

34:54.475 --> 34:55.610
The site is registered

34:55.676 --> 34:57.712
to a Charles Barkin
from Hackensack.

34:57.778 --> 35:01.148
Charlie Barkin. It's from
<i>All Dogs Go to Heaven.</i>

35:01.215 --> 35:04.485
- And the address is a Petco in New Jersey.
- Boom.

35:04.552 --> 35:08.556
Well, look at you. We got ourselves
a couple of queenpins in the making.

35:08.623 --> 35:11.425
- Damn, you hear that?
- Mm-hmm.

35:11.492 --> 35:13.661
We queenpins, bitch.

35:13.728 --> 35:16.397
Relax, 'cause it's still
way too easy to trace back to you.

35:16.464 --> 35:19.667
Is there anything else
I should know about?

35:19.734 --> 35:22.436
<i>Yo, yo, yo.
It's time to save with JoJo.</i>

35:22.503 --> 35:24.839
<i>You know what makes your booty
so fine?</i>

35:24.906 --> 35:28.910
<i>Half-off booty
from savvysupersaver.com.</i>

35:30.878 --> 35:32.580
Seriously?

35:32.647 --> 35:34.415
You see, my YouTube's
a part of my brand, so...

35:34.482 --> 35:36.684
<i>That's 48 real rolls,
okay, y'all?</i>

35:36.751 --> 35:38.953
<i>Head over to Savvy Super Sa...</i>

35:39.020 --> 35:44.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
Where you go, girl?

35:44.525 --> 35:47.295
Trust me, nobody gives a bag
of dicks about your brand.

35:47.361 --> 35:49.764
What you guys need
is a front for your business.

35:49.830 --> 35:50.965
All of this money is dirty,

35:51.032 --> 35:53.467
so don't go spending dough
on shit you can't write off.

35:53.534 --> 35:54.902
Give it six months,

35:54.969 --> 35:57.538
and make sure it ain't
Alarm-ageddon out there.

35:57.605 --> 36:01.309
You got that? And to start,
we need aliases, and lots of 'em.

36:01.375 --> 36:04.412
From there, we open up bank
accounts, apply for credit cards,

36:04.478 --> 36:07.381
and don't be doing this shit
at home.

36:07.448 --> 36:09.383
Rent a stash house, okay?

36:09.450 --> 36:12.253
And from now on, use this.
It's an IronKey.

36:12.320 --> 36:14.655
It's military-grade encryption.
Just stick it in your USB.

36:14.722 --> 36:18.326
Uh, for my help, I take 10%
of everything you make.

36:18.392 --> 36:19.827
Girl, what?

36:19.894 --> 36:21.262
Well, I'm worth it.

36:21.329 --> 36:23.297
The good news is, ladies,

36:23.364 --> 36:25.399
is you are entering
a real growth industry, okay.

36:25.466 --> 36:28.402
Pink-collar crime,
it's fly as fuck right now.

36:28.469 --> 36:31.405
We get you square,
and this coupon hustle,

36:31.472 --> 36:33.674
it's gonna pay off
in a big, big way.

36:35.009 --> 36:37.678
Could you say it all again
and, like, much slower?

36:37.745 --> 36:39.847
I don't know what half
those things you said were.

36:39.914 --> 36:42.316
- And do you have a pad and pen maybe?
- Pen and paper, yeah.

36:42.383 --> 36:44.418
Or give me my phone back.
I'll take notes.

36:44.485 --> 36:46.887
- Just to write it down.
- No. No.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.956
- We don't got it, but we got it.
- We will wing it.

36:58.032 --> 36:59.734
<i>Yeah, I mean,
you and me are...</i>

36:59.800 --> 37:01.969
We're standing on the tip
of the iceberg here.

37:02.036 --> 37:04.772
Ah, it's probably just...
...China.

37:04.839 --> 37:07.808
Oh. Can't be China.

37:07.875 --> 37:09.610
Why not China?

37:09.677 --> 37:12.380
Ah, no, China's just...
You gotta trust me on this one.

37:12.446 --> 37:14.682
I mean these...
these are gall-damn perfect.

37:14.749 --> 37:17.718
You know this...
China couldn't pull this one off. No.

37:17.785 --> 37:19.687
These... It's all
in the file folder.

37:19.754 --> 37:21.589
- I mean, the, uh, coupon warning sheets...
- Yeah. Okay.

37:21.656 --> 37:23.557
...the website,
the interview with the mother.

37:23.624 --> 37:25.793
- It's... It's... It's a real bombshell.
- Yeah.

37:25.860 --> 37:29.597
Don't say bombshell
in an FBI building.

37:29.664 --> 37:32.933
- I thought maybe don't say bomb.
- Don't say bomb anything.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.835
- Sorry.
- What's wrong with you?

37:34.902 --> 37:38.606
No, I just... I'm trying to
relay the severity of the case.

37:38.673 --> 37:39.807
I just, uh...

37:39.874 --> 37:41.709
This is a crisis
at a national level.

37:41.776 --> 37:44.311
- This is my Pelican Brief.
- Okay. Okay.

37:44.378 --> 37:46.380
- Okay. Ken? Ken, okay.
- Yes, sir.

37:46.447 --> 37:49.850
Ken, you have my attention.
You have her attention.

37:49.917 --> 37:51.452
Oh. Hey.

37:51.519 --> 37:55.056
I think we should run this
up the chain to HQ.

37:56.424 --> 37:59.427
- That's, uh, it's good to hear that.
- Yeah.

37:59.493 --> 38:01.362
'Cause, I mean,
that's great.

38:01.429 --> 38:02.963
Uh, we're gonna need a whole
team working on this thing.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.498
Yep, yep. Mm-hmm.

38:04.565 --> 38:07.635
- Is... Do you do tours?
- Uh, we d... We don't.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.603
Well, you got my card.
I gave you my card and that.

38:09.670 --> 38:10.638
Yeah, we got your card.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.039
- We got your email.
- Email.

38:12.106 --> 38:14.375
We got your... your snail mail.
We got everything.

38:14.442 --> 38:15.876
- Trust me, trust me.
- That's good.

38:15.943 --> 38:17.878
You're going to be hearing
from DC real soon. Yeah.

38:17.945 --> 38:20.514
- Okay. Thanks so much, guys. This is fun.
- Thank you.

38:20.581 --> 38:22.450
- Appreciate it, uh...
- We'll do it again.

38:22.516 --> 38:24.118
Ken. See you, Ken.

38:26.554 --> 38:31.692
Who the fuck let that kook in here?
I mean, come on. Coupons? Coupons?

38:31.759 --> 38:33.928
Dealing with
national security, terrorism,

38:33.994 --> 38:36.363
and this nutbag
is babbling on about coupons.

38:36.430 --> 38:37.698
I can't... Just... Here.

38:37.765 --> 38:41.602
Why don't we let that shit
get lost in DC?

38:43.637 --> 38:45.072
<i>This is Ken Miller.</i>

38:45.139 --> 38:48.442
<i>Salt Lake City referred
my coupon case to HQ.</i>

38:48.509 --> 38:52.680
<i>Uh, whether I gotta fax or email or
what have you, uh, you let me know,</i>

38:52.747 --> 38:56.050
<i>'cause I would love to get in touch
with, uh, you guys and gals,</i>

38:56.117 --> 38:57.952
<i>whoever's working the beat.</i>

38:58.018 --> 39:00.087
<i>All right. Ken Miller.</i>

39:05.793 --> 39:07.595
- Looking for someone?
- I was told to find

39:07.661 --> 39:10.064
the lowest rung on the ladder.
Is that you?

39:16.036 --> 39:17.705
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

39:17.772 --> 39:18.773
Mm-hmm.

39:44.598 --> 39:46.834
- Nice truck!
- Nice new house!

39:46.901 --> 39:49.937
- So big!
- Thank you.

39:50.004 --> 39:51.806
Had to rent it
for the business.

39:51.872 --> 39:55.442
<i>Uh, just leaving
message number umpteenth.</i>

39:55.509 --> 39:57.745
<i>Uh, hoping y'all are gonna
give me a call back.</i>

39:57.812 --> 40:00.748
<i>I am sitting here waiting.
I think you know my number by now.</i>

40:00.815 --> 40:02.917
Okay, what's with all
the free fucking coupons?

40:11.525 --> 40:12.660
<i>Hey, this is Ken Miller.</i>

40:12.726 --> 40:14.562
<i>I... Shit.</i>

40:14.628 --> 40:17.498
<i>I just spilled some coffee.
I'm gonna call you guys back.</i>

40:20.935 --> 40:24.205
<i>This is Ken.
Just checking in again.</i>

40:24.271 --> 40:26.740
<i>Um, Miller, it's Ken Miller.</i>

40:26.807 --> 40:29.777
<i>The "I" still stands for
investigation, right?</i>

40:39.687 --> 40:42.656
- It's been six months!
- I know.

40:42.723 --> 40:47.761
Today's the day we finally
get to spend our money!

40:47.828 --> 40:50.831
I know. Hey, I added up
everything in all of our accounts.

40:50.898 --> 40:52.666
- Mm-hmm.
- You wanna know what we've got?

40:54.568 --> 40:57.104
- 5,230,000...
- What?

40:57.171 --> 40:58.772
...and 55 cents.

40:58.839 --> 41:00.241
- We're millionaires!
- I know!

41:00.307 --> 41:03.077
We're filthy fucking rich!

41:03.143 --> 41:05.512
- <i>♪ Hey, Dirty ♪</i>
- What?

41:05.579 --> 41:08.515
<i>♪ Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry ♪</i>

41:08.582 --> 41:09.984
- <i>♪ I said hey ♪</i>
- Sing it!

41:10.050 --> 41:14.622
<i>♪ Baby, I got your money
Hey Dirty ♪</i>

41:14.688 --> 41:17.591
<i>♪ Baby, I got your money
Don't you worry ♪</i>

41:17.658 --> 41:19.093
- Hey.
- Wait. Dirty.

41:19.159 --> 41:22.162
Didn't Tempe Tina say
that all the money is dirty?

41:22.229 --> 41:25.099
- What?
- We still have to clean it.

41:26.300 --> 41:27.735
Fuck!

41:27.801 --> 41:30.938
Did she? Wha...
Call her ass up.

41:35.075 --> 41:36.744
<i>We're sorry.
You have reached a number</i>

41:36.810 --> 41:39.613
<i>that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.</i>

41:39.680 --> 41:40.848
<i>If you feel you have re...</i>

41:40.915 --> 41:42.983
Think she's using
a burner phone?

41:43.050 --> 41:45.319
What do we do now?
I'm a multimillionaire

41:45.386 --> 41:46.987
and I can't spend
any of my money?

41:47.054 --> 41:48.255
That's fucking bullshit.

41:48.322 --> 41:50.257
Wait a minute.

41:50.324 --> 41:52.326
- Rick.
- What about him?

41:53.394 --> 41:55.296
Rick is always griping to me

41:55.362 --> 41:57.765
about how these different
companies hide their money.

41:57.831 --> 42:00.868
They funnel money through, like,
offshore accounts in the Cayman Islands.

42:00.935 --> 42:03.304
Honestly, I try to tune out
all of the audit talk,

42:03.370 --> 42:08.142
but there was this one story about this
comptroller guy in Tacoma, Washington,

42:08.208 --> 42:10.077
who embezzled $25 million.

42:10.144 --> 42:14.281
And the only reason I remember
is because his name was Guy Rich.

42:14.348 --> 42:16.150
- Guy Rich?
- That's what I said.

42:16.216 --> 42:18.052
Rick was like, "Yeah."

42:18.118 --> 42:22.356
Anyway, he said that Guy's
stupidity actually helped him.

42:22.423 --> 42:24.792
'Cause he didn't know anything
about the Cayman Islands account.

42:24.858 --> 42:27.895
So what he did instead
was bought a bunch of stuff.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.863
And then he went out
and sold it,

42:29.930 --> 42:33.600
and whatever he made
from selling it was clean.

42:33.667 --> 42:36.870
JoJo, we need to get all of our money
out of these different bank accounts,

42:36.937 --> 42:40.607
buy a bunch of expensive stuff
and then sell it.

42:40.674 --> 42:42.743
And all the money
we make from selling it

42:42.810 --> 42:44.244
- will be clean.
- Will be clean.

42:45.346 --> 42:47.348
Okay. All right.

42:47.414 --> 42:50.851
But you can't just walk into a bank
and take out a shitload of money.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.020
Can you?

42:53.087 --> 42:55.856
Ooh. Girl,
we are gonna get you together.

42:55.923 --> 42:57.324
Really?
This dress with that blazer?

42:57.391 --> 43:00.661
Yes! A hundred percent!
Just trust me, okay?

43:00.728 --> 43:02.363
<i>Just let JoJo work her magic.</i>

43:02.429 --> 43:03.897
Yes!

43:25.886 --> 43:27.354
Hi. Joseph Johnson, please.

43:27.421 --> 43:29.356
Straight ahead
through that door.

43:35.763 --> 43:37.431
And you must be Melissa.

43:37.498 --> 43:39.666
- Very nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

43:39.733 --> 43:40.834
I'll be honest with you,
Melissa.

43:40.901 --> 43:42.336
I was pretty suspicious
at first.

43:42.403 --> 43:44.438
You moving around
this kind of money.

43:44.505 --> 43:47.207
With this being a border state,
we're extra vigilant, Nancy,

43:47.274 --> 43:49.943
because we're dealing with
some pretty dangerous people.

43:50.010 --> 43:51.311
Lucky for us, Stephanie,

43:51.378 --> 43:53.380
the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network

43:53.447 --> 43:55.382
has established
dollar amount thresholds

43:55.449 --> 43:56.984
to guard against
money laundering.

43:57.051 --> 43:59.386
But obviously
you're not the cartel.

43:59.453 --> 44:03.991
You're not hiring mules,
smuggling what have you across the border.

44:04.058 --> 44:08.729
No, no. You're just a hardworking,
successful, female entrepreneur.

44:08.796 --> 44:13.267
Now, your business.
What is Back-2-Black exactly?

44:13.333 --> 44:16.403
It's a cosmetics line

44:16.470 --> 44:18.972
for...
...people of color.

44:20.174 --> 44:22.042
People of color?

44:22.476 --> 44:23.477
Huh.

44:26.480 --> 44:30.751
Well, if there's a demand,
why not you?

44:30.818 --> 44:33.954
Hey, Barbara, we're gonna need some help
carrying Ms. Russell's money over here.

44:35.956 --> 44:38.158
Let's go get you your money.

44:38.225 --> 44:40.127
Will hundreds be a problem?

44:41.962 --> 44:43.230
Super-duper.

44:48.168 --> 44:49.436
Oh, my God.

44:49.503 --> 44:51.371
- Look at all this money.
- I know.

44:51.438 --> 44:53.440
How are we
gonna clean it all?

44:53.507 --> 44:57.311
You know we gotta go shopping.
What would a guy buy with all this cash?

44:57.377 --> 44:59.813
Yeah.
Like, what would Rick buy?

45:05.352 --> 45:07.321
What's up? I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

45:07.387 --> 45:09.256
Hey, quick question.

45:10.290 --> 45:14.361
What would I buy
if money was no object?

45:14.428 --> 45:17.030
Why are you asking me?
You know what, doesn't matter.

45:17.097 --> 45:20.767
I guess I would buy
a Lamborghini.

45:46.360 --> 45:48.562
And finally,
the Lamborghini Urus

45:48.629 --> 45:51.165
merges the soul
of a sports car

45:51.231 --> 45:53.433
with the functionality
of an SUV.

45:53.500 --> 45:56.270
You truly can't call yourself
a real American

45:56.336 --> 45:59.139
till you've been behind the
wheel of a Marathon Coach

45:59.206 --> 46:01.942
- built on a Prevost chassis.
- How much for this one?

46:02.009 --> 46:05.846
This beauty
is priced at $265,000.

46:05.913 --> 46:07.581
Oh, uh,
don't forget the boat.

46:07.648 --> 46:09.283
Oh, yeah.
How much for the boat?

46:09.349 --> 46:11.451
What do you say, ladies?
Which one do you want?

46:12.653 --> 46:13.921
We'll take them all.

46:25.065 --> 46:28.135
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

46:35.475 --> 46:40.280
You know, every A&G store in America
is affected as well, so I hear ya.

46:40.347 --> 46:41.982
- I hear ya.
- <i>Do you, Ken?</i>

46:42.049 --> 46:43.483
<i>Do you understand
the trickle-down</i>

46:43.550 --> 46:46.019
<i>if corporations like us
don't make money?</i>

46:46.086 --> 46:49.289
<i>We can't pay taxes. Then suddenly
the roads aren't getting fixed.</i>

46:49.356 --> 46:51.425
<i>Teachers are losing
their jobs.</i>

46:51.491 --> 46:54.261
<i>Before you know it, John Q.
Public is getting mugged at gunpoint,</i>

46:54.328 --> 46:55.996
- <i>maybe gang-raped.</i>
- Uh...

46:56.063 --> 46:58.165
<i>And where are the cops?
There are no more cops.</i>

46:58.232 --> 46:59.499
Okay, Craig, I...

47:00.100 --> 47:01.568
Oh, 7:00 a.m.

47:01.635 --> 47:03.937
Yeah, one sec, Craig.
I gotta call you back.

47:04.004 --> 47:05.606
<i>We're
supposed to be the good guys here,</i>

47:05.672 --> 47:07.608
<i>giving everybody
a great deal. Shit...</i>

47:07.674 --> 47:11.411
Yeah. Hey, you know, Bill, I...
I actually got another call coming in.

47:11.478 --> 47:13.080
I'm going to switch over,
okay?

47:13.146 --> 47:15.115
<i>It's a goddamn priority
we find out who...</i>

47:16.250 --> 47:17.951
Hello?

47:18.018 --> 47:19.620
<i>Oh, hi. Yes,
I'm calling for Ken Miller.</i>

47:19.686 --> 47:21.154
<i>Speaking.</i>

47:21.221 --> 47:23.390
Ken, hi.
My name is Albert Anderson.

47:23.457 --> 47:25.525
I'm calling from the Federal
Bureau of Investigations

47:25.592 --> 47:27.894
about your counterfeit
coupon case.

47:27.961 --> 47:30.330
<i>Thank God you're calling me.
Hey, wait a sec.</i>

47:30.397 --> 47:34.935
I have been calling you guys,
leaving messages ad nauseam,

47:35.002 --> 47:36.670
and here you are,
finally getting back to me.

47:36.737 --> 47:38.572
This is "real soon"?
Let me tell you what.

47:38.639 --> 47:41.341
We need boots on the ground
ASAP right now. Okay, bud?

47:41.408 --> 47:42.943
Uh,

47:43.010 --> 47:45.212
I'm an intelligence analyst

47:45.279 --> 47:49.049
working out of
a sub-subbasement.

47:49.116 --> 47:52.252
My field experience
is literally zero.

47:52.319 --> 47:55.322
Yeah, that sounds about right.
You got to be fucking kidding me.

47:55.389 --> 47:59.226
Unfortunately, no. But I am calling
you because I think I can help.

47:59.293 --> 48:02.029
Yeah, don't...
don't let me stop ya.

48:02.095 --> 48:03.964
Give me
the master plan here, bub.

48:04.031 --> 48:07.401
Okay, uh, well, this Savvy
Super Saver website.

48:07.467 --> 48:10.337
Now, the interface
is complete amateur hour,

48:10.404 --> 48:13.073
<i>but the problem
is with the site's back end.</i>

48:13.140 --> 48:15.575
<i>I've used every possible tool
at my disposal</i>

48:15.642 --> 48:17.644
<i>and I am meeting
nothing but dead ends.</i>

48:17.711 --> 48:19.579
<i>The IP address is untraceable,</i>

48:19.646 --> 48:22.349
there's no analytics,
no cookie trails.

48:23.350 --> 48:25.218
Guess what I'm trying
to say is...

48:26.219 --> 48:29.156
none of it really adds up.

48:29.222 --> 48:32.359
Okay, so how's that
supposed to help me, Albert?

48:32.426 --> 48:36.163
Oh, well, I guess it doesn't.
But, um...

48:36.229 --> 48:39.199
The fuck, Albert?
Talking about cookie trails.

48:39.266 --> 48:40.701
<i>I don't know this shit.</i>

48:40.767 --> 48:43.170
Do you realize that
these counterfeit coupons,

48:43.236 --> 48:45.305
tens of thousands of 'em,
have been mailed out all over the country?

48:45.372 --> 48:47.674
- <i>And I'm the one who's supposed to...</i>
- Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

48:47.741 --> 48:49.276
Did you say mail?

48:49.343 --> 48:53.413
Like, postal, snail mail,
not by email?

48:53.480 --> 48:57.617
Mail. Like...
Like through the post office.

48:57.684 --> 49:00.754
Okay. Help is on the way.

49:00.821 --> 49:03.490
Yeah, you're gonna have those boots
on the ground within 48 hours.

49:03.557 --> 49:07.627
Okay, so now we're talking.
Now what are we...

49:07.694 --> 49:09.429
And he hung up. Goddamn.

49:25.445 --> 49:26.513
Ken Miller?

49:27.180 --> 49:28.715
Oh, yeah. And you are?

49:28.782 --> 49:31.752
- Simon Kilmurry, US postal inspector.
- Oh, with the Federal Bureau...

49:31.818 --> 49:33.720
US... Sorry, say that again?

49:33.787 --> 49:36.590
I'm with the US Postal Service.

49:36.656 --> 49:40.460
The Postal Service? No. No, no.
They said that they were sending the FBI.

49:40.527 --> 49:44.064
This is unacceptable.
They... I...

49:44.131 --> 49:47.067
So what do you do?
You, like, carry mail around or something?

49:47.134 --> 49:51.071
That would be a mailman.
They carry the mail. I carry a gun.

49:51.138 --> 49:54.040
This company, Kimberly-Clark,

49:54.107 --> 49:56.510
issues just under
a thousand of these coupons.

49:56.576 --> 50:01.314
As of this week,
over 15,000 of them have been redeemed.

50:01.381 --> 50:04.117
As if that wasn't bad enough,
we can't tell the difference

50:04.184 --> 50:06.753
between the real,
legitimate coupons and the counterfeits.

50:06.820 --> 50:10.357
Well, I do appreciate you
contacting the FBI,

50:10.424 --> 50:13.427
but the postal inspectors
will take it from here.

50:14.294 --> 50:16.129
I appreciate your initiative,

50:16.196 --> 50:18.298
but this is my case.
All right?

50:18.365 --> 50:20.233
You're gonna need me
on this one.

50:20.300 --> 50:22.769
You can't just waltz in here
and take the food off my plate.

50:22.836 --> 50:26.406
This is my thing. This is my deal.
Unless you wanna be partners.

50:26.473 --> 50:28.642
- We could be partners on this.
- No. No, we can't be partners.

50:28.708 --> 50:30.710
And you wanna know why
we can't be partners?

50:30.777 --> 50:32.779
'Cause I'm a federal
law enforcement officer.

50:32.846 --> 50:36.383
I carry a firearm, I solve
crimes, and I arrest people.

50:36.450 --> 50:39.619
You're a private citizen who
chases around 15-year-old girls

50:39.686 --> 50:42.656
for lifting packs
of Juicy Fruit.

50:42.722 --> 50:45.492
That's one thing I do
of many.

50:45.559 --> 50:49.463
I-I know coupons.
I live coupons.

50:49.529 --> 50:52.532
So what happened when you tried
to order some off the website?

50:53.600 --> 50:54.835
What are you... I didn't.

50:54.901 --> 50:56.203
So you've done nothing?

50:56.269 --> 50:57.471
I did someth...

50:57.537 --> 50:59.673
- I did a lot of things.
- I did...

50:59.739 --> 51:02.209
You know what I did?
Here's what the fuck I did.

51:02.275 --> 51:04.611
I called the FBI, and I said,
"Can you help me out?"

51:04.678 --> 51:07.814
They said, "Sure, boots on the ground."
And then they brought me a postman.

51:07.881 --> 51:12.319
All right, Ken, I tell you what.
You seem to know a lot about coupons.

51:12.385 --> 51:17.190
So, why don't you order some off the
website, and they'll come in the mail.

51:17.257 --> 51:19.226
And then we can all see
where they're from.

51:19.292 --> 51:23.296
But, uh, just to be clear so
there's good boundaries in place,

51:23.363 --> 51:24.798
we're not partners.

51:24.865 --> 51:28.802
But what
about you making me, uh,

51:28.869 --> 51:31.671
some sort of a deputized
citizen or something?

51:31.738 --> 51:33.573
Just from
a placard standpoint.

51:34.975 --> 51:37.577
- A deputized citizen?
- Yeah.

51:37.644 --> 51:39.880
So what am I doing?
Am I forming a posse here?

51:39.946 --> 51:41.915
No, I'm sorry. It's...

51:42.649 --> 51:44.784
What's your action item?

51:44.851 --> 51:48.255
- My... My actionable item?
- What is your action item?

51:48.321 --> 51:51.258
Action item is to order
the coupons off the website.

51:53.326 --> 51:55.929
That's a good i...
That was a good idea too.

51:59.866 --> 52:01.635
Oh, yes.

52:04.271 --> 52:06.373
Guns? No. No way.

52:06.439 --> 52:08.875
Not happening. Never.

52:08.942 --> 52:11.478
We can go to Shake Baby after
and get a milkshake.

52:14.314 --> 52:16.283
What has
the best resale value?

52:16.349 --> 52:18.818
We're looking for
a good investment.

52:18.885 --> 52:21.555
All right, well,
that'd probably be this here.

52:21.621 --> 52:24.858
This is a KelTec
KSG tactical shotgun.

52:24.925 --> 52:27.460
It's pump-action. Right?

52:27.527 --> 52:29.829
Now y'all seen <i>John Wick,</i> right?
John Wick movies?

52:29.896 --> 52:31.765
- Yes. Absolutely.
- Yeah, yeah.

52:31.831 --> 52:33.333
There ain't
no better commercial for a gun

52:33.400 --> 52:34.834
than a John Wick movie.

52:34.901 --> 52:38.838
The moment Keanu
used this sexy bad boy,

52:38.905 --> 52:40.874
the price just went
straight through the roof.

52:40.941 --> 52:43.343
Is it cheaper
if we buy them in bulk?

52:47.514 --> 52:49.583
- Ah.
- Mmm.

52:50.383 --> 52:51.718
Mmm.

52:51.785 --> 52:53.520
That probably shouldn't
have been that easy.

53:02.662 --> 53:04.531
Champagne?

53:17.444 --> 53:18.545
Oh. Ah!

53:19.012 --> 53:20.347
Oh, yeah!

53:20.413 --> 53:22.682
- Coupons! Coupons!
- Coupons! Coupons!

53:29.889 --> 53:31.491
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

53:31.558 --> 53:33.627
What are you going to do
with your half of the money?

53:33.693 --> 53:35.362
Oh, okay.

53:35.428 --> 53:37.430
Um, I'm gonna pay off
Mama Josie's mortgage...

53:37.497 --> 53:39.666
- Mmm, mm-hmm.
- ...hire her a live-in housekeeper,

53:39.733 --> 53:41.935
and then, I don't know.

53:42.002 --> 53:45.271
I wanna go somewhere exotic.
Like somewhere with a beach.

53:45.338 --> 53:46.840
- You know?
- Mmm.

53:46.906 --> 53:48.675
What about you?
What are you gonna do with your share?

53:48.742 --> 53:50.777
Well...

53:52.479 --> 53:54.814
- Okay. You want to hear something crazy?
- Always.

53:54.881 --> 53:58.952
I made an appointment
at the fertility clinic.

54:00.453 --> 54:02.288
And I know it's a long shot,

54:02.355 --> 54:04.691
but I just figured, why not?
You know?

54:04.758 --> 54:07.994
Yeah, okay.
Uh... What did Rick say?

54:08.695 --> 54:10.330
I didn't tell Rick.

54:11.064 --> 54:12.932
I was kinda hoping
you'd go with me.

54:13.900 --> 54:17.671
Connie. Of course!
You know I gotta go.

54:17.737 --> 54:19.806
- You will?
- Yes!

54:19.873 --> 54:22.475
'Cause when this little girl asks her
auntie JoJo the story of her life,

54:22.542 --> 54:25.845
I'm gonna say, "Girl,
this all started with a coupon."

54:27.647 --> 54:32.752
Okay, so what we got here
is a address for a pet store,

54:32.819 --> 54:34.054
a Petco in Kansas.

54:34.120 --> 54:35.622
I Google Mapped it.

54:35.689 --> 54:38.091
The nearest airport
is Kansas City, Missouri.

54:38.158 --> 54:41.695
So I took the liberty of booking us
a little red-eye flight over there.

54:41.761 --> 54:43.663
Booked us? Okay.

54:43.730 --> 54:46.633
Ken, we are not doing this.
We are not...

54:46.700 --> 54:49.669
Kansas, huh?
Did you check the postage?

54:49.736 --> 54:52.839
- What, like the stamp?
- Well, there is no stamp.

54:52.906 --> 54:55.108
They're using
an online postage service,

54:55.175 --> 54:57.444
which also means
there's no postmark.

54:57.510 --> 55:00.613
- Okay, so...
- Okay, so the zip code on the postmark

55:00.680 --> 55:03.349
and the zip code on the return
address, well, they don't match.

55:03.416 --> 55:06.720
So, the return address, well,
that's Kansas, anything starting with 6-6.

55:06.786 --> 55:09.456
And the postage, 8-5-0-1-3,

55:09.522 --> 55:11.691
anything starting with 8-5,
that's Arizona.

55:11.758 --> 55:15.028
And the last three digits,
0-1-3, that's Phoenix.

55:15.095 --> 55:17.097
So screw
what the return address says.

55:17.163 --> 55:18.765
These things were mailed...

55:18.832 --> 55:21.134
Mailed from Phoenix.
That's impressive. Holy shit.

55:21.201 --> 55:22.569
I'm sorry.

55:22.635 --> 55:24.704
Did you actually memorize
the zip code

55:24.771 --> 55:25.872
for every city in the country?

55:25.939 --> 55:28.007
I'm a postal inspector, Ken.

55:28.074 --> 55:30.477
And all things being equal,

55:30.543 --> 55:32.746
the simplest explanation
tends to be the right one.

55:32.812 --> 55:34.447
Oh, my God.

55:34.514 --> 55:35.749
So if those things
were mailed out of Phoenix,

55:35.815 --> 55:37.484
then the criminal outfit
behind these are...

55:37.550 --> 55:38.952
- From Phoenix.
- ...also in Phoenix.

55:39.018 --> 55:40.954
Yeah, that's... You gotta
let me in on this thing.

55:41.020 --> 55:43.490
I'm Mr. Phoenix.
I'm there every month.

55:43.556 --> 55:45.925
There's nine A&G stores
in the area. I can help.

55:45.992 --> 55:48.461
- Ken, we've been through it.
- Please, come on.

55:52.699 --> 55:55.168
All right.
I shouldn't be doing this.

55:55.969 --> 55:57.637
- What are you...
- Okay.

55:57.704 --> 55:59.639
Put your left hand on my badge
and raise your right hand.

55:59.706 --> 56:02.575
- Oh, holy shit. Yes, yes, yes. Okay.
- Repeat after me.

56:02.642 --> 56:04.644
I, Ken Miller,
do solemnly swear...

56:04.711 --> 56:06.713
I, Ken Miller,
do solemnly swear...

56:06.780 --> 56:08.181
That I'm being fucked with.

56:08.248 --> 56:10.917
That I'm being...
Oh, fuck you, man. Come on!

56:10.984 --> 56:12.552
- What did you think was gonna happen?
- I don't know.

56:12.619 --> 56:15.054
I don't have the power to make you a
deputy on anything. We've talked about it.

56:15.121 --> 56:17.957
Thought you might give me a chance.
I thought maybe you would...

56:18.024 --> 56:20.460
Okay, listen. Y-You're right.

56:20.527 --> 56:24.831
Fifteen years I've spent tracking lowlifes
shoving shit in their pockets. I get it.

56:24.898 --> 56:28.468
But it's a real case.
I... I...

56:28.535 --> 56:31.604
I thought you'd give me a chance at
doing something that actually mattered.

56:33.873 --> 56:36.676
I... Oh, shit.

56:37.644 --> 56:38.912
Maybe you can help.

56:38.978 --> 56:40.513
You do know Phoenix,
and you already gave me

56:40.580 --> 56:42.015
a really good lead
with those coupons.

56:42.081 --> 56:43.983
And I don't want you
to feel bad.

56:44.050 --> 56:46.186
ATF, DEA, FBI,

56:46.252 --> 56:48.955
most of those assholes would already
be on a plane to Kansas by now.

56:50.123 --> 56:51.858
But you can't cheat the mail.

56:51.925 --> 56:53.760
<i>And you
can't cheat Father Time.</i>

56:53.827 --> 56:57.130
There is a price to pay for all
your training over the years.

56:57.197 --> 57:01.801
- I hate to say it.
- This is... your last shot.

57:03.770 --> 57:05.171
Well...

57:05.238 --> 57:07.640
I'm egg-cited to give it a go.

57:07.707 --> 57:11.044
Egg humor.
Well, here's one for you.

57:11.110 --> 57:12.612
Uh, last time we tried this,

57:12.679 --> 57:16.082
your average yield
was only four or five eggs.

57:16.149 --> 57:18.251
Whew.
Damn, girl.

57:18.318 --> 57:20.620
But the good news
is that we still have

57:20.687 --> 57:22.755
some of Rick's sperm
from last time. So...

57:22.822 --> 57:26.092
Uh, do we have to use
his sperm?

57:27.660 --> 57:30.263
Well, no, but...

57:30.330 --> 57:33.166
I mean, he is your husband.

57:34.567 --> 57:36.903
Yeah, I think
we'd like to shop around.

57:36.970 --> 57:39.973
- Okay, so there's no photos?
- No photos.

57:40.039 --> 57:41.908
- It feels like a huge flaw in the system.
- Aw.

57:41.975 --> 57:45.178
- What about that one?
- Oh. Well, let's take a closer look.

57:50.016 --> 57:51.651
Geez.

57:51.718 --> 57:54.888
This donor was very active.
We have over 400 vials.

57:55.855 --> 57:57.523
- 400?
- Yeah.

57:57.590 --> 57:59.225
6'2", high IQ,

57:59.292 --> 58:01.561
- extremely high motility levels.
- Ooh.

58:01.628 --> 58:03.630
His little guys
are like Olympic swimmers.

58:03.696 --> 58:05.832
- Olympic?
- Uh-huh.

58:05.899 --> 58:07.967
Hello, Mr. Baby Batter.

58:08.034 --> 58:10.837
You know what?

58:10.904 --> 58:13.640
I bet a lot of women can't
afford high-quality sperm.

58:13.706 --> 58:16.075
We could get it to
them at a discount price.

58:16.142 --> 58:17.977
Do you take cash?

58:24.284 --> 58:27.887
Did we just spend $330,000
on one man's sperm?

58:30.156 --> 58:33.026
You know, I bet we'll be the first
people to launder money selling semen.

58:33.092 --> 58:34.594
Right?

58:34.661 --> 58:36.562
I don't know.

58:36.629 --> 58:38.731
Getting a call
from Switzerland.

58:38.798 --> 58:39.832
Weird.

58:40.633 --> 58:41.834
Hello?

58:43.169 --> 58:44.837
Oh, hey, Tina.

58:44.904 --> 58:46.306
Are... Are you in Switzerland?

58:48.041 --> 58:49.776
Oh, no, right. You're here.

58:49.842 --> 58:51.277
Oh, you're here, here.

58:51.344 --> 58:54.080
Yeah, okay.
Uh, we'll be out in a jiff.

58:56.049 --> 58:57.050
- She's here.
- Oh.

59:05.391 --> 59:07.860
Tempe, Juicy Fruit?

59:18.004 --> 59:20.807
Any idea
why I brought you guys here?

59:20.873 --> 59:21.941
- No.
- No.

59:22.008 --> 59:23.910
Where the fuck
is all your money?

59:24.744 --> 59:26.879
- Oh, that. We...
- Oh.

59:26.946 --> 59:29.649
- Um, relax.
- Girl, we got it.

59:29.716 --> 59:31.918
We took care of everything.
I mean, we're self-starters.

59:31.985 --> 59:34.721
- We're queenpins. Remember you said?
- That's who you're looking at.

59:34.787 --> 59:36.222
- You said it.
- "Queenpins."

59:36.289 --> 59:37.657
We're cleaning it!

59:37.724 --> 59:41.060
Okay. And, uh,
why are you cleaning it?

59:41.127 --> 59:45.198
- Because it's... dirty.
- It's dirty, Tina.

59:45.264 --> 59:48.768
You don't have any dirty money.
Do you know why?

59:48.835 --> 59:52.705
'Cause your front company
Back-2-Black's sole purpose

59:52.772 --> 59:54.240
is to clean your money.

59:54.307 --> 59:57.210
So, you're...
you're telling us that w...

59:58.478 --> 59:59.512
- Wait.
- That we don't...

59:59.579 --> 01:00:01.914
- All the fucking money is already clean?
- Oh, my God.

01:00:01.981 --> 01:00:03.783
I'm just, like, over you guys.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:05.852
- Can I be honest?
- Yeah.

01:00:05.918 --> 01:00:07.754
- I wish you would've let me write...
- That's what I'm saying.

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:09.789
You didn't let her write it
down, so we didn't know.

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:12.325
I asked for a pad. You said it was dirty.
I got home. I...

01:00:12.392 --> 01:00:14.927
All right. You're gonna go to
the bank every couple of days.

01:00:14.994 --> 01:00:17.063
Just take the money
in small increments. Okay?

01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:18.731
And put it in the bank
in small increments.

01:00:18.798 --> 01:00:20.666
Can you do that?
And not fuck that up?

01:00:20.733 --> 01:00:23.036
We can...
That's something we can totally do.

01:00:23.102 --> 01:00:25.171
- We st...
- We, um...

01:00:25.238 --> 01:00:28.141
We still have
some of it left, but...

01:00:29.142 --> 01:00:30.877
We bought a few things.

01:00:31.411 --> 01:00:33.413
A few things?

01:00:33.479 --> 01:00:37.683
You guys said a few things.
This is not a few things.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:41.220
This is a big red flag.
You need to sell this shit now.

01:00:41.287 --> 01:00:42.922
Okay. Yeah.

01:00:42.989 --> 01:00:44.457
We also bought
a bunch of guns.

01:00:44.524 --> 01:00:47.393
Guns?
Where are you gonna sell guns?

01:00:48.428 --> 01:00:50.029
We're gonna
figure that out.

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:52.165
Or eBay.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:55.134
- Or eBay.
- Was my first thought.

01:00:56.436 --> 01:00:58.805
There's nothing more
important than the mail, Ken.

01:00:58.871 --> 01:01:02.175
People put pen to paper
with their innermost thoughts.

01:01:02.241 --> 01:01:05.111
And then they seal it in an
envelope, and they put a stamp on it.

01:01:05.178 --> 01:01:07.413
They trust us with their
secrets, and we deliver.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.015
Yeah, no, I guess...

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.417
I have a hard time
believing anybody gives a hoot

01:01:11.484 --> 01:01:13.719
when they get a letter
in the mail.

01:01:13.786 --> 01:01:16.089
Yeah.

01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:26.299
I have a feeling
that Leo F. Sullivan

01:01:26.365 --> 01:01:28.734
gave a hoot about getting
a letter in the mail.

01:01:32.839 --> 01:01:35.942
Marked October 16th, 1918.

01:01:39.378 --> 01:01:41.280
"Dear Mary,

01:01:41.347 --> 01:01:44.217
I received two of your
letters a couple weeks ago,

01:01:44.283 --> 01:01:47.019
and they brought the usual
amount of good cheer.

01:01:47.086 --> 01:01:50.223
Those letters made the trip
with me to the front,

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:54.127
and now all I have to do
is put my hand in my pocket,

01:01:54.193 --> 01:01:55.761
and there you are.

01:01:55.828 --> 01:01:57.830
I spoke to
Father Tom Holbrook

01:01:57.897 --> 01:02:00.766
about my big desire within
to return to you

01:02:00.833 --> 01:02:05.338
and the ache in my heart to meet our
little Irene and hold her in my arms.

01:02:06.172 --> 01:02:07.874
I took my last confession

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:10.977
and now head out to battle
with a clear conscience

01:02:11.043 --> 01:02:15.448
and a heart full of thoughts
of you, my dear, sweet Mary.

01:02:15.515 --> 01:02:19.485
As ever I remain,
Leo F. Sullivan."

01:02:26.592 --> 01:02:29.262
I think some people do care
about getting a letter, Ken.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:35.134
- Wait, wha... what happened?
- What do you mean what happened?

01:02:35.201 --> 01:02:36.536
Did he make it?

01:02:36.602 --> 01:02:39.805
You know, did he, um...
did he survive the battle?

01:02:39.872 --> 01:02:42.108
Doesn't matter if Leo made
it or Leo didn't make it.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:45.878
What matters is that the letter survived.
The letter made it.

01:02:45.945 --> 01:02:47.980
And it's something
that we take very seriously.

01:02:48.047 --> 01:02:50.950
Yeah, I get that. I just...

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.819
It's hard not to think
about the Sullivan family.

01:02:53.886 --> 01:02:56.956
What... Whatever happened to Mary?
Did she become a widow?

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.058
Ken. Ken, it was
a hundred years ago.

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:00.960
All the Sullivans
are probably dead.

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:04.063
I wonder.
Did he ever get to hold Irene?

01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:06.299
Are these relatives
of yours? Are they...

01:03:06.365 --> 01:03:08.968
I think we're all related
in some ways. Don't you, Ken?

01:03:09.969 --> 01:03:10.970
Hmm?

01:03:12.104 --> 01:03:13.839
Welcome to Phoenix.

01:03:13.906 --> 01:03:17.610
5,000 square miles of hot-as-shit
desert, suburban sprawl.

01:03:17.677 --> 01:03:20.613
Yeah, well, some haystacks
are bigger than others,

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.982
but the bad guys
are out there.

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:24.383
Trouble for them,

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:27.286
they decided to do bad things
through the mail.

01:03:27.353 --> 01:03:29.855
Now we're gonna handle this
the post office way.

01:03:29.922 --> 01:03:32.124
Yeah, I kinda wish you
hadn't read me that letter.

01:03:32.191 --> 01:03:34.994
I can't stop thinking
if that guy survived or not.

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:37.230
Oh, Ken, you're missing
the point of it.

01:03:37.296 --> 01:03:41.167
<i>...where the temperature is
currently 89 degrees, southwest winds...</i>

01:04:10.429 --> 01:04:13.399
Hey. What's going on
around here?

01:04:15.968 --> 01:04:18.037
Did we get a new TV?

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:21.374
I can't get anything past you.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.175
It was supposed to be
a surprise.

01:04:23.242 --> 01:04:26.312
You know,
you telling me to get a job

01:04:26.379 --> 01:04:29.115
was exactly the push I needed
to realize I could do better.

01:04:29.181 --> 01:04:31.584
So I marched out there,
and I got a job.

01:04:31.651 --> 01:04:33.586
A job doing what?

01:04:33.653 --> 01:04:36.555
Sales.
Just a boring old sales job.

01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:39.425
You know, filling orders
and stuffing envelopes mostly.

01:04:39.492 --> 01:04:42.261
And the couponing?
What's going on with that?

01:04:42.328 --> 01:04:44.463
Oh, I don't use coupons
anymore.

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:45.464
You're shitting me.

01:04:45.531 --> 01:04:47.166
I hope you don't mind.

01:04:47.233 --> 01:04:49.969
I used my first paycheck
to buy you your 4K TV.

01:04:50.036 --> 01:04:52.371
Why would I mind?
I mean...

01:04:52.438 --> 01:04:56.175
...got a brand-new TV
and a brand-new wife.

01:04:58.377 --> 01:05:01.047
Yep. Connie 2.0.

01:05:01.113 --> 01:05:02.281
Enjoy.

01:05:05.017 --> 01:05:07.320
Are you sure you don't wanna
discuss this with your husband

01:05:07.386 --> 01:05:09.322
before I implant the embryos?

01:05:09.388 --> 01:05:11.557
Remember,
I can't un-bake the cake.

01:05:11.624 --> 01:05:14.193
Dude. It's her body.
It's her choice.

01:05:15.728 --> 01:05:17.163
No.

01:05:17.229 --> 01:05:19.365
We didn't use
any of his ingredients.

01:05:19.432 --> 01:05:21.701
He doesn't deserve
a piece of my cake.

01:05:21.767 --> 01:05:25.304
You all know Ken
Miller, the store's LPO.

01:05:25.371 --> 01:05:28.507
And with him
is Simon Kilmurry.

01:05:28.574 --> 01:05:30.743
He's an FBI agent
who wants to ask you...

01:05:30.810 --> 01:05:33.179
- A postal inspector.
- What's that?

01:05:33.245 --> 01:05:35.348
I'm a US postal inspector.

01:05:35.414 --> 01:05:39.251
Oh. He's a postal inspector,
whatever that means.

01:05:39.318 --> 01:05:42.388
We're just looking for any customers
with strange coupon habits,

01:05:42.455 --> 01:05:46.992
any irregular coupon activity,
uh, frequency of use,

01:05:47.059 --> 01:05:50.363
any customers who have
unusually high savings.

01:05:50.429 --> 01:05:53.999
First of all, people literally
forget you're even a human being.

01:05:54.066 --> 01:05:57.136
Then she's gonna lecture me on how
plastic bags are killing our planet

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:59.238
like I'm the asshole
who invented plastic.

01:05:59.305 --> 01:06:02.174
We call her the "Oh, wait.
I have a coupon" lady

01:06:02.241 --> 01:06:06.145
'cause she only remembers she has a
coupon in her hand after she's paid.

01:06:06.212 --> 01:06:09.215
We call him "Mr. Bullshit" 'cause he
makes you check in the back for stuff.

01:06:09.281 --> 01:06:14.153
And every time we tell him we're out,
he always screams out, "Bullshit!" Yeah.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:17.123
Well, I guess that's it.
Hope it helps.

01:06:17.189 --> 01:06:19.692
Oh, wait.
We do have one other cashier.

01:06:19.759 --> 01:06:22.695
I call her
the "Crazy Coupon Lady."

01:06:22.762 --> 01:06:25.197
Got this smile
plastered across her face,

01:06:25.264 --> 01:06:28.300
ridiculous amount of coupons
in her hand every time.

01:06:28.367 --> 01:06:32.405
And, of course, everybody's backed
up, waiting, waiting, waiting.

01:06:32.471 --> 01:06:36.575
And they're getting pissed
at me. At me!

01:06:36.642 --> 01:06:38.210
- And the worst part...
- Okay.

01:06:38.277 --> 01:06:40.713
...she had this fucking
catchphrase, okay,

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:44.750
this little saying she would spew
at me every time before she left.

01:06:44.817 --> 01:06:46.519
"Watch the pennies,

01:06:46.585 --> 01:06:48.354
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah." And I'm like...

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.456
I'm sorry, I gotta
back you up there.

01:06:50.523 --> 01:06:52.458
Did you say...
Was the phrase,

01:06:52.525 --> 01:06:56.162
"Watch the pennies, and then the
dollars will take care of themselves"?

01:06:56.796 --> 01:06:59.098
Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly it.

01:06:59.165 --> 01:07:01.467
Okay, we're connecting then now.
We're connecting here.

01:07:01.534 --> 01:07:04.203
So let me ask you this. What is her name?
What is this woman's name?

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:05.805
I don't know her name, man.
I fucking hate her.

01:07:05.871 --> 01:07:08.207
But you've done the transactions.
You see the card.

01:07:08.274 --> 01:07:10.743
- I'm sure you got her name, right?
- Crazy Coupon Lady.

01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:13.646
- Description. What does she look like?
- She's, like, three feet tall.

01:07:13.712 --> 01:07:15.281
- Call a sketch artist!
- Okay.

01:07:15.347 --> 01:07:17.216
We gotta have somebody
down here.

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:19.185
Can you stay there
for a second?

01:07:19.251 --> 01:07:21.554
Ken, Ken. I'd like to talk
to you for just a minute.

01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:23.656
This is good.
Don't forget the...

01:07:23.722 --> 01:07:25.424
- Remember where we were at.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:07:25.491 --> 01:07:27.226
You can't be
screaming at him.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.495
What did you scream at the
guy, "Call a sketch artist"?

01:07:29.562 --> 01:07:32.465
- Yeah, I...
- Who do you think she is, Keyser Söze?

01:07:32.531 --> 01:07:34.467
Ken, just take it
down a notch.

01:07:34.533 --> 01:07:38.571
- Slow it all down. Okay?
- I'm slowing it down,

01:07:38.637 --> 01:07:42.475
and I'm going to slowly tell
you exactly what happened there.

01:07:42.541 --> 01:07:46.712
He gave us the seed that's gonna
become the fucking branches, okay?

01:07:46.779 --> 01:07:48.481
- That lady, that's the gal.
- What does it...

01:07:48.547 --> 01:07:50.749
That's the gal! That phrase.
Did you not hear it?

01:07:50.816 --> 01:07:53.853
"Watch the pennies. Dollars take
care of themselves." That's...

01:07:53.919 --> 01:07:58.624
I mean, that is literally plastered
on the Savvy Super Saver website.

01:08:00.326 --> 01:08:03.496
Okay. Well, that is interesting.
That's helpful.

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:08.767
And did you know that
your average shopper

01:08:08.834 --> 01:08:13.506
travels 2.27 miles to their
nearest local grocery store?

01:08:13.572 --> 01:08:16.609
- Is that true? Are you right about that?
- Yeah. That's a fact.

01:08:16.675 --> 01:08:19.612
If you are, that means our haystack
just went from 5,000 square miles

01:08:19.678 --> 01:08:21.814
- down to a two-mile radius...
- We're shrinking it.

01:08:21.881 --> 01:08:24.283
...and we should get boots
on the ground. Look at me.

01:08:25.451 --> 01:08:28.587
- That's good, Ken. That's great.
- Thanks.

01:08:28.654 --> 01:08:30.555
Now do it without
the screaming, okay?

01:08:30.622 --> 01:08:32.825
It's just passion.
I'm a passionate man.

01:08:32.892 --> 01:08:34.792
You can be passionate
without being an idiot.

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:41.200
Whew.

01:08:41.267 --> 01:08:43.536
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:08:43.602 --> 01:08:45.270
Ugh, girl, eBay is a bust.

01:08:45.337 --> 01:08:47.540
It's just too much.
I can't sell it fast enough.

01:08:47.606 --> 01:08:51.277
What are we gonna do? It's not like we
can have a yard sale for all this shit.

01:08:56.916 --> 01:08:59.585
We are investigating
a counterfeit coupon ring

01:08:59.652 --> 01:09:03.221
that we believe is operating
somewhere within your postal routes.

01:09:03.288 --> 01:09:05.758
Now, the mail that's being
picked up is primarily envelopes

01:09:05.823 --> 01:09:09.627
with a Kansas return address
and marked "Savvy Super Saver."

01:09:09.694 --> 01:09:14.265
Suspect is a Caucasian female,
late 30s, approximately 5'1".

01:09:14.332 --> 01:09:18.636
One witness described her as overly
cheerful with a superiority complex.

01:09:18.703 --> 01:09:21.907
She may or may not
have accomplices.

01:09:21.974 --> 01:09:25.877
Hey, Earl, what about that gal
you won't stop blabbing about?

01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:28.781
Um, not sure I know
what he's talking about.

01:09:28.846 --> 01:09:31.584
You know, the girl.
She makes all these coupon videos.

01:09:31.649 --> 01:09:33.419
I'm sorry.
Did you say "coupon videos"?

01:09:33.484 --> 01:09:36.822
I don't know
nothing about nobody, uh...

01:09:36.889 --> 01:09:39.591
The girl. Yeah, she lives over
on, uh, Clayton Avenue.

01:09:39.658 --> 01:09:43.395
What's her name? Uh, Coco? JoJo?
It's JoJo, right? Or is it Coco?

01:09:43.462 --> 01:09:46.665
Hold on. You said she's Caucasian?
Whoopsie-daisy. Never mind.

01:09:46.732 --> 01:09:50.269
She's a Black gal.
A Black woman. Lady. So...

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:53.538
Oh, shit. Look.
These open carry dudes.

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:54.807
Hi. Do you have oat milk?

01:09:54.873 --> 01:09:56.442
Oat milk is over there.

01:09:56.508 --> 01:09:58.711
Oh. Maybe they want to buy our guns?

01:09:58.777 --> 01:10:01.847
- Morning. What can I get for you two?
- Hey, what's up, baby?

01:10:01.914 --> 01:10:05.651
- Let me grab a skinny caramel macchiato.
- Connie.

01:10:05.718 --> 01:10:08.954
- Large coffee. Black.
- What are you doing?

01:10:09.021 --> 01:10:10.789
Mmm.

01:10:10.856 --> 01:10:12.324
Nice.

01:10:12.391 --> 01:10:16.996
Couldn't help but notice. Are you
fellas part of some sort of gun club?

01:10:17.062 --> 01:10:19.498
Just practicing
our right to bear arms...

01:10:19.565 --> 01:10:21.500
- Oh, okay.
- ...while we pick up coffee.

01:10:21.567 --> 01:10:25.738
- I got two macchiatos for Stephanie.
- Oh, that's me.

01:10:25.804 --> 01:10:27.940
- Stephanie. Hiya. And you are?
- Hey.

01:10:28.007 --> 01:10:29.408
I'm Rattlesnake.

01:10:30.109 --> 01:10:31.677
That's catchy.
Rattlesnake.

01:10:31.744 --> 01:10:33.712
- Sandman.
- That's a good one too.

01:10:35.347 --> 01:10:37.750
Hey, I was wondering...

01:10:37.816 --> 01:10:39.051
We don't know where we're going.
We don't know who these people are.

01:10:39.118 --> 01:10:41.654
Yes, we do.
He dropped me a pin.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.555
- Oh, he dropped you a pin.
- Yeah.

01:10:43.622 --> 01:10:46.058
- So we know... We're good now. That's it.
- JoJo.

01:10:46.125 --> 01:10:49.028
What do you want me to say? It's not
like we can have a yard sale, okay?

01:10:49.094 --> 01:10:52.031
And you just do what you do on your
sales calls, like you taught me.

01:10:52.097 --> 01:10:53.732
You make the customer
the hero.

01:10:53.799 --> 01:10:55.401
- The hero?
- Yeah.

01:10:55.467 --> 01:10:57.936
These guys could be KKK,
Aryan Brotherhood, anything.

01:10:58.003 --> 01:11:00.039
And you want me
to make them the heroes?

01:11:00.105 --> 01:11:04.076
I highly doubt that, okay?
Did you see what Rattlesnake ordered?

01:11:04.143 --> 01:11:06.779
A caramel macchiato
doesn't sound very KKK to me.

01:11:06.845 --> 01:11:10.315
Am I in any kind
of trouble here, or...

01:11:11.116 --> 01:11:14.053
Well, it's kind of
up to you, Earl.

01:11:14.119 --> 01:11:16.088
You gonna dance
with the tiger?

01:11:17.056 --> 01:11:19.525
- You gonna play some ball?
- I'm sorry...

01:11:19.591 --> 01:11:22.661
I'm not quite sure who the tiger is that
someone would be dancing with, Earl.

01:11:22.728 --> 01:11:24.530
- Are you?
- No, sir.

01:11:24.596 --> 01:11:26.398
- It's about cooperation.
- Do you mind if I call you Earl?

01:11:26.465 --> 01:11:27.866
Oh, no. No problem.

01:11:27.933 --> 01:11:30.402
Earl, how long have you been
with the post office?

01:11:30.469 --> 01:11:33.539
- Oh, well, it's going on eleven years now.
- Eleven years.

01:11:33.605 --> 01:11:35.074
And have you had
the same route for most of it?

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.942
Oh, yes, sir.
That's how I like it.

01:11:37.009 --> 01:11:40.045
Okay. And probably getting pretty
close to your pension here?

01:11:40.112 --> 01:11:41.680
Oh, you bet. Yes.

01:11:41.747 --> 01:11:43.849
Who's the Earl, girl?

01:11:46.885 --> 01:11:49.655
- Who's the girl, Earl?
- Whoa, am I under arrest here?

01:11:49.722 --> 01:11:52.825
No, you're not under arrest.
God, that was loud. It scared me too.

01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:54.426
But we need some answers.

01:11:54.493 --> 01:11:57.396
The guy out there is
talking about coupon videos.

01:11:57.463 --> 01:11:59.665
You seem to not know
a darn thing about it.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:02.468
That had nothing to...
I don't know what he was talking about.

01:12:02.534 --> 01:12:05.704
You might want to talk to Adam,
'cause I have no idea about any girl...

01:12:05.771 --> 01:12:07.840
- Adam. What's his last name?
- Phillips.

01:12:07.906 --> 01:12:09.842
Adam Phil... Two L's?

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:11.744
You're not giving me
enough here!

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:13.879
I think it's pretty clear that
Earl doesn't know anything.

01:12:13.946 --> 01:12:16.582
I think your coworker must have
got his signals crossed somehow.

01:12:16.648 --> 01:12:19.985
- Yes, sir.
- Unfortunately, there is one kind

01:12:20.052 --> 01:12:22.154
of uncomfortable question
pertaining to this.

01:12:22.221 --> 01:12:23.522
Yes, sir.

01:12:25.057 --> 01:12:26.725
Have you ever danced
with a tiger?

01:12:28.827 --> 01:12:30.162
It was his joke.
It wasn't...

01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:32.898
- Tiger dance.
- What are you... Don't dance.

01:12:32.965 --> 01:12:34.933
Anyway, thank you so much.
I appreciate you.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.002
- Sure thing. No problem.
- Sorry about the confusion.

01:12:37.069 --> 01:12:39.338
- Oh, no. It's cool.
- Have a good time out there.

01:12:43.175 --> 01:12:46.879
The hell was that?
I had him on the ropes.

01:12:46.945 --> 01:12:48.947
Screaming at somebody doesn't
make 'em tell you the truth.

01:12:49.014 --> 01:12:51.450
He could've been sweating bullets.
I had him bent, man.

01:12:51.517 --> 01:12:53.786
Let's agree to disagree.
We're gonna go for a ride.

01:13:04.496 --> 01:13:05.664
Hey, Earl!

01:13:05.731 --> 01:13:08.634
Oh, hey!

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:10.736
There you go. Yeah.

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:13.472
Uh, that top one right there for JoJo
is real, real important, Ms. Johnson.

01:13:13.539 --> 01:13:16.108
Oh, that girl
been up to something.

01:13:16.175 --> 01:13:18.777
You just gotta promise that she
get that letter, Ms. Johnson.

01:13:18.844 --> 01:13:21.847
Oh, yeah, yeah, you the mailman.
Now, I get how this shit works.

01:13:26.919 --> 01:13:28.887
Yeah,
I don't know about that interaction.

01:13:28.954 --> 01:13:31.156
And now
he's just standing there.

01:13:31.223 --> 01:13:35.127
The DMV database lists
two names at 1579 Clayton.

01:13:35.194 --> 01:13:37.830
Josephine Johnson,
60 years of age,

01:13:37.896 --> 01:13:40.566
and Joanna Johnson,
33 years of age.

01:13:40.632 --> 01:13:42.134
Joanna Johnson.

01:13:43.268 --> 01:13:44.970
The fuck's that sound?

01:13:46.238 --> 01:13:49.241
It's 120 degrees.
Car's overheating, and the fan's dying.

01:13:49.308 --> 01:13:53.679
Go ahead. Roll down your windows,
and, uh, I gotta kill the engine here.

01:13:53.745 --> 01:13:56.081
That's no good.

01:13:57.616 --> 01:13:59.751
Ooh. Okay.

01:14:00.786 --> 01:14:06.191
Joanna Johnson.
Joanna John... JJ. Jo...

01:14:06.258 --> 01:14:08.894
Oh! JoJo?

01:14:08.961 --> 01:14:12.664
We must be crazy. Oh, my God.
I don't have any cell service. Do you?

01:14:12.731 --> 01:14:16.902
Will you relax? I promise I will
not let anything happen to you.

01:14:16.969 --> 01:14:19.104
You can't promise that.

01:14:19.171 --> 01:14:21.573
You have no idea what
you're asking me to do here.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.841
I understand.

01:14:22.908 --> 01:14:24.877
No, you do not understand.

01:14:26.144 --> 01:14:30.115
- All right.
- What the fuck is this?

01:14:30.182 --> 01:14:32.117
Okay.

01:14:32.184 --> 01:14:34.720
Wait.
Is that a helicopter? What?

01:14:34.786 --> 01:14:36.755
Talk about a stockpile. Yikes.

01:14:36.822 --> 01:14:38.523
Oh, my God.
Is that a missile?

01:14:39.157 --> 01:14:41.560
Okay.

01:14:41.627 --> 01:14:43.228
- We got it.
- All right. Oh, you're gonna get...

01:14:43.295 --> 01:14:45.097
Gentlemen.
Thank you. Whoop.

01:14:45.764 --> 01:14:46.932
Oh, sure.

01:14:49.167 --> 01:14:51.236
This is Captain Pain.

01:14:51.303 --> 01:14:53.739
These are the guns
I was telling you about.

01:14:53.805 --> 01:14:56.174
Captain Pain. Connie.

01:14:56.241 --> 01:14:59.144
Stephanie Kaminski.
Nice to m... meet you.

01:14:59.211 --> 01:15:01.546
This is a cool place
you guys have.

01:15:05.150 --> 01:15:08.020
- What the fuck is this?
- All right, boys.

01:15:08.086 --> 01:15:10.689
I think you guys love guns as
much as I love guns, right?

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:14.293
So, uh, like we told
your friend Rattlesnake,

01:15:14.359 --> 01:15:16.762
we just happen to have
a surplus in our stockpile.

01:15:16.828 --> 01:15:18.330
- One too many.
- Personal favorite.

01:15:18.397 --> 01:15:20.632
This here is the KelTec
pump-action shotgun.

01:15:20.699 --> 01:15:22.334
- Easy, easy.
- It's cool.

01:15:22.401 --> 01:15:24.903
It's not loaded. You can ch...
Connie, just show 'em.

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:27.906
Easy to handle, quickest reload
on the market. You know, even...

01:15:27.973 --> 01:15:30.309
Do you wanna take
a look at that, Sandman?

01:15:30.375 --> 01:15:35.047
- So hot. I'm gonna faint.
- I just found it. It's, uh...

01:15:35.113 --> 01:15:37.082
She says, and I quote,

01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:42.187
"A friend sent a video of an
African-American woman going on and on."

01:15:42.254 --> 01:15:46.258
That woman
was in a coupon video.

01:15:46.325 --> 01:15:49.695
- And all things being equal...
- Uh, the... Don't say it.

01:15:49.761 --> 01:15:53.065
"The simplest explanation tends
to be the right one." Yeah.

01:15:53.131 --> 01:15:55.734
- So, where are you, JoJo?
- Where are you, JoJo?

01:16:06.111 --> 01:16:08.113
No deal.

01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:10.349
- All right. Let's wrap it up. Let's go.
- Wait, wait.

01:16:10.415 --> 01:16:13.018
No. It's just... We thought
the money was dirty, so w...

01:16:13.085 --> 01:16:14.753
What did you say?

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.288
- Whose money's dirty? Our money's dirty?
- Wait!

01:16:16.355 --> 01:16:18.790
- We thought our money...
- What did you just say?

01:16:18.857 --> 01:16:21.893
Don't even... What she meant was,
we came into a bunch of fucking money.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.096
It doesn't matter how.

01:16:24.162 --> 01:16:26.131
We thought it was dirty.
It was not.

01:16:26.198 --> 01:16:28.333
We bought all these guns,
and now we have to off-load them.

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:30.068
That's it.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:34.006
And we'll give you
a really good discount.

01:16:34.072 --> 01:16:35.707
What kind of discount?

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:40.879
- Eleven hundred each? Seventy thousand?
- That's retail.

01:16:40.946 --> 01:16:42.381
- That is not retail!
- Get outta here, dude.

01:16:42.447 --> 01:16:43.782
Fifty.

01:16:44.316 --> 01:16:46.818
- Sixty-five.
- Sixty.

01:16:46.885 --> 01:16:49.321
Sixty-five.
It's a good deal.

01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.796
Okay. You got a deal.

01:16:58.930 --> 01:17:00.198
We'll take 'em all.

01:17:11.777 --> 01:17:13.278
Don't do that. Ken.

01:17:13.345 --> 01:17:14.980
- I'm sorry.
- Don't do that.

01:17:15.947 --> 01:17:17.115
Don't do that.

01:17:20.519 --> 01:17:22.921
Yo, heads up. Heads up.

01:17:23.455 --> 01:17:25.057
Okay.

01:17:25.123 --> 01:17:27.325
Is that her? Is that J...
That's JoJo?

01:17:27.392 --> 01:17:29.428
Yeah. Well,
she pulled in the right driveway.

01:17:29.494 --> 01:17:31.963
Well, we'll see
in a minute here.

01:17:35.133 --> 01:17:38.170
<i>JoJo! JoJo! JoJo!</i>

01:17:38.236 --> 01:17:42.207
<i>JoJo! JoJo! JoJo!</i>

01:17:42.274 --> 01:17:44.042
<i>JoJo! Jo...</i>

01:17:44.109 --> 01:17:46.912
<i>Okay. You got a deal.</i>

01:18:01.126 --> 01:18:03.762
What the hell is she doing?

01:18:15.006 --> 01:18:18.143
<i>Happiness is
when what you think, say and do...</i>

01:18:19.478 --> 01:18:21.213
Think that's Joanna Johnson?

01:18:25.183 --> 01:18:27.018
That's JoJo.

01:18:27.085 --> 01:18:28.987
Now we just gotta see
who she's working with.

01:18:36.228 --> 01:18:39.865
Wow.
That was quite a show.

01:18:42.033 --> 01:18:45.871
Yeah. The hell?
So, okay, now what?

01:18:45.937 --> 01:18:49.274
Now. Now we wait.

01:18:49.841 --> 01:18:50.742
Wait?

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:52.210
Isn't that what we been doing
all damn day?

01:18:52.277 --> 01:18:56.314
Why don't we just go on her front
lawn, knock on the door and arrest her?

01:18:56.381 --> 01:18:59.251
Arrest her?
Arrest her for what?

01:18:59.317 --> 01:19:02.787
For putting on a damn show
in her driveway?

01:19:02.854 --> 01:19:05.257
You know, Ken, you actually
do have to collect evidence.

01:19:05.323 --> 01:19:07.926
Okay, well, if we're gonna
be here all dang night,

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:11.163
then I'm just gonna pull
my trousers up.

01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:17.869
What's that noise?

01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:19.404
That noise.

01:19:19.471 --> 01:19:22.841
That's the...
Oh, God.

01:19:22.908 --> 01:19:24.943
Geez. Are you regular?

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.411
Huh?

01:19:26.478 --> 01:19:29.581
Every morning, I shit like clockwork.

01:19:29.648 --> 01:19:32.150
So what is that,
some kind of a shit alarm?

01:19:32.217 --> 01:19:34.052
- No...
- What's with the chimes?

01:19:34.119 --> 01:19:37.088
Yeah, well, the chimes are soothing.
They set things in motion.

01:19:37.155 --> 01:19:39.157
I'm just trying to find
out what's going on.

01:19:39.224 --> 01:19:41.459
- Ma, it's none of your business.
- No, hey, hey!

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:44.829
I'm not one of
your little friends... Ow.

01:19:44.896 --> 01:19:48.099
Oh. Every time
I yell at you, it hurts.

01:19:48.166 --> 01:19:51.836
I call it my JoJo pain.

01:19:51.903 --> 01:19:53.171
Ma.

01:19:53.238 --> 01:19:54.606
I'm sorry. Okay, Mama?
Come here.

01:19:54.673 --> 01:19:57.108
- Oh!
- My mama.

01:19:57.175 --> 01:19:59.244
- I'm sorry. I'm just working hard, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:59.311 --> 01:20:02.847
How you think I'm able to buy all this
new stuff and pay all these bills?

01:20:02.914 --> 01:20:04.950
Another stack of them bills
shown up here yesterday.

01:20:05.016 --> 01:20:06.618
Okay. I'm gonna
take care of it later.

01:20:06.685 --> 01:20:08.520
- Love you, Ma. See you later, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:09.588 --> 01:20:11.590
Don't come in here late!

01:20:14.593 --> 01:20:16.561
Hold up.
Target's on the move.

01:20:16.628 --> 01:20:20.165
- Eyes open. Just stay alert here.
- All right.

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:22.033
Okay.

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:25.570
Hold it together, Ken.
This is your white whale.

01:20:43.521 --> 01:20:45.023
You ever hear of Mr. Zip?

01:20:45.090 --> 01:20:46.424
No, I haven't
heard of that guy.

01:20:46.491 --> 01:20:47.926
- Robert A. Moon.
- Mmm.

01:20:50.395 --> 01:20:53.231
<i>You don't get to the
top of Mount Everest by following...</i>

01:20:55.267 --> 01:20:57.402
He's the genius
behind the zip code.

01:20:58.436 --> 01:21:00.305
<i>The journey is the destina...</i>

01:21:08.179 --> 01:21:10.248
We'll turn around
up here and circle back.

01:21:10.315 --> 01:21:12.617
Yeah, I'm just saying
it's not good to hold it in.

01:21:29.301 --> 01:21:31.002
- Oh, God.
- Hang on.

01:21:31.069 --> 01:21:33.104
Where'd the minivan come from?

01:21:34.105 --> 01:21:36.941
I don't wanna
startle you, Simon,

01:21:37.008 --> 01:21:38.677
but, uh, you should know

01:21:38.743 --> 01:21:43.248
that I'm prepared to take
this thing the whole way.

01:21:45.083 --> 01:21:46.117
What?

01:21:47.118 --> 01:21:49.254
What are you saying?

01:21:49.321 --> 01:21:52.490
I'm gonna shit my pants,
but that's okay.

01:21:52.557 --> 01:21:55.493
No. Actually, Ken,
that's not okay.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:59.097
Okay? There's not a world that
exists where that would be okay.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:02.734
Well, in this world
it does exist. This is real.

01:22:02.801 --> 01:22:05.270
You gotta embrace it 'cause I'm
not getting out of this vehicle.

01:22:05.337 --> 01:22:06.571
Ken.

01:22:06.638 --> 01:22:08.273
Ken.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.076
You don't shit...
You don't shit in the car.

01:22:11.142 --> 01:22:14.346
Okay, I'm gonna do a bank run.
I'll be back in a jiff.

01:22:14.412 --> 01:22:16.247
Perfect.

01:22:16.314 --> 01:22:19.718
All men are forced to make
difficult decisions. This is mine.

01:22:19.784 --> 01:22:22.454
We're too close,
and I have come too far.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.189
I hear everything
you're saying.

01:22:25.056 --> 01:22:26.658
You don't shit
in the car, Ken.

01:22:26.725 --> 01:22:28.593
You don't shit
in the car.

01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:31.262
It's a rental. You pay a cleaning fee.
Everybody moves on.

01:22:31.329 --> 01:22:33.131
Yeah, it's a rental
that I rented.

01:22:33.198 --> 01:22:35.467
Most people wouldn't even
tell me that they had to shit.

01:22:35.533 --> 01:22:38.002
They just would make up an excuse
and they'd get out of the car, okay?

01:22:38.069 --> 01:22:39.204
You're a grown man, Ken.

01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:41.005
Go walk to the restroom.

01:22:41.072 --> 01:22:42.774
Go shit
in the fucking brush.

01:22:42.841 --> 01:22:45.310
I really don't care.
Just figure it out and go and take a...

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:47.445
Holy shit.

01:22:48.146 --> 01:22:49.447
Late 30s.

01:22:49.514 --> 01:22:54.085
Slim build, 5'1".
Seems cheerful enough.

01:22:54.619 --> 01:22:56.588
My white whale.

01:22:57.789 --> 01:22:59.257
Ah. There she blows.

01:22:59.324 --> 01:23:03.328
Jesus Christ!

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:05.463
Fucking animal.

01:23:06.097 --> 01:23:07.465
Are you serious?

01:23:07.532 --> 01:23:10.268
Are you fucking crazy?

01:23:10.335 --> 01:23:14.038
Jesus Christ! You can't
just take a shit in a car.

01:23:14.105 --> 01:23:16.541
I know. I'm sorry.

01:23:16.608 --> 01:23:19.043
To be fair, this is like
my beach in Normandy...

01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:21.713
No, it's not. This isn't heroic.
This is bad stomach management.

01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.315
Your ass smells like a fucking
outhouse at a carnival.

01:23:24.382 --> 01:23:26.084
Go wipe your ass
like a puppy on the grass.

01:23:26.151 --> 01:23:27.519
Get that fucking ass
out of here.

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.054
I don't wanna get it
on the seat,

01:23:30.121 --> 01:23:32.690
so I'm gonna sit up like this,
or something.

01:23:34.726 --> 01:23:36.261
Well, we got her.

01:23:39.697 --> 01:23:42.200
A silver 2010 Dodge Caravan.

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:46.404
Now, that is registered
to Connie Kaminski,

01:23:46.471 --> 01:23:48.640
born Connie Stevens
of Olathe, Kansas,

01:23:48.706 --> 01:23:53.344
uh, both parents deceased,
and get this, former Olympian.

01:23:53.411 --> 01:23:56.247
- Olympian? What event?
- Racewalking.

01:23:56.314 --> 01:24:00.151
That's not real. Did you
say racewalking? That's a real thing?

01:24:00.218 --> 01:24:03.755
It's a largely ignored
but often ridiculed event,

01:24:03.822 --> 01:24:05.557
kinda like couponing.

01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:08.593
Why are you wearing
pajama pants?

01:24:09.794 --> 01:24:12.730
- I took one for the team. Yeah.
- He had an accident.

01:24:12.797 --> 01:24:15.467
Nothing wrong
with a little elasticity.

01:24:15.533 --> 01:24:17.735
Except in
a professional environment.

01:24:17.802 --> 01:24:20.405
- I wish I was dressed different.
- Moving on.

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:23.541
Now, cashier Greg Garcia
corroborated.

01:24:23.608 --> 01:24:28.313
Ooh! That's her.
That giant fucking smile.

01:24:30.181 --> 01:24:32.150
I think
I got something here.

01:24:32.217 --> 01:24:36.354
It's an invoice.
A lease on an airplane hangar.

01:24:36.421 --> 01:24:38.556
An airplane hangar?

01:24:38.623 --> 01:24:41.259
What the hell are they doing
with an airplane hangar?

01:24:42.861 --> 01:24:44.629
Let's go, boys! Gear up.

01:24:44.696 --> 01:24:46.831
I think
I owe you an apology.

01:24:46.898 --> 01:24:49.701
You guys are like the FBI.

01:24:49.767 --> 01:24:52.837
Negative.
FBI's like us.

01:24:52.904 --> 01:24:55.707
Don't fuck with the post office.

01:24:55.773 --> 01:24:58.476
Uh, you know,
careful out there.

01:24:58.543 --> 01:25:00.879
Good luck, you know.
Do your thing.

01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:05.817
Wanna do a ride-along?

01:25:08.486 --> 01:25:10.355
You messing with me?

01:25:10.822 --> 01:25:12.490
That's a 10-4.

01:25:14.859 --> 01:25:17.228
Just stay out of the way
and listen.

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:44.622
So what are we dealing with?

01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:47.659
Drug runners?
Arms dealers?

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:49.928
It's coupons.

01:25:52.297 --> 01:25:54.299
Come again?

01:25:54.365 --> 01:25:59.270
It's coupons.
It's two women counterfeiting coupons.

01:26:02.674 --> 01:26:04.842
I mean,
this feels like a lot.

01:26:04.909 --> 01:26:07.879
You don't think we're coming
in a little hot here, boss?

01:26:07.946 --> 01:26:10.615
- Boss.
- All right, gentlemen. Lock and load!

01:26:17.555 --> 01:26:20.792
Good Lord have mercy, Jesus.

01:26:20.858 --> 01:26:23.394
My own child
fixing to suffocate me.

01:26:23.461 --> 01:26:25.430
Ma. Oh, my gosh.

01:26:25.496 --> 01:26:27.932
- Help me with this thing.
- Okay, okay.

01:26:27.999 --> 01:26:30.668
Ma, I'm not trying to suffocate you.

01:26:30.735 --> 01:26:32.637
I thought you stopped
breathing or something.

01:26:32.704 --> 01:26:34.906
- I was trying to save your ass.
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:34.973 --> 01:26:39.377
Ma, I can't sleep. I don't know.
I'm just anxious. I...

01:26:39.444 --> 01:26:41.279
I fear something bad
must have happened.

01:26:41.346 --> 01:26:42.880
- Ken.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:42.947 --> 01:26:44.983
- Do not go near that house.
- No, sir.

01:26:45.049 --> 01:26:46.718
I want you
staying by the vehicles.

01:26:46.784 --> 01:26:48.319
I will fall back, sir.

01:26:48.386 --> 01:26:50.555
- You are not in the military, Ken.
- Yes, sir.

01:26:50.622 --> 01:26:52.957
Do not get
caught up in this moment.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:03.601
Mmm.

01:27:04.936 --> 01:27:06.871
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:27:11.809 --> 01:27:12.877
Hmm.

01:27:18.683 --> 01:27:21.352
<i>Dear JoJo,
you in some serious shit, girl.</i>

01:27:21.419 --> 01:27:23.921

01:27:25.690 --> 01:27:26.891
- <i>Hugs and kisses.</i>
- Feds?

01:27:29.794 --> 01:27:31.562
How was your trip?

01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:33.831
Connie Kaminski. You're under arrest.

01:27:33.898 --> 01:27:36.034
Show me your hands! Show 'em!

01:27:37.735 --> 01:27:39.437
Keep 'em up. Don't move.

01:27:41.005 --> 01:27:43.408
Freeze! Freeze!

01:27:43.474 --> 01:27:44.842
What the hell
is going on here?

01:27:44.909 --> 01:27:46.611
Okay. Oh, my God. Okay.

01:27:46.678 --> 01:27:49.380
Okay. This is Joanna Johnson.
The po-po got in my house...

01:27:49.447 --> 01:27:51.449
- Stop!
- Joanna Johnson! We have a warrant!

01:27:51.516 --> 01:27:55.086
- Girl, I knew you was up to something.
- Ma, don't say anything. Ma!

01:27:55.153 --> 01:27:58.856
In all my life I never had no
police up in my house like this.

01:28:46.671 --> 01:28:49.040
Move! Go, go, go!

01:28:49.107 --> 01:28:51.609
- With me! Move, move, move!
- Stairs clear!

01:28:57.715 --> 01:29:00.151
This is a fuck ton
of coupons, sir.

01:29:00.218 --> 01:29:02.987
Look, baby diapers.

01:29:03.054 --> 01:29:04.856
Could use these. Just had one.

01:29:14.165 --> 01:29:16.868
- I got the computer.
- Sir, what about this room full of food?

01:29:16.934 --> 01:29:19.170
What about it?
It's food. Leave it.

<i>Coming up, an anonymous tip helps

01:29:45.163 --> 01:29:46.731
How are you?

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:49.433
Look, let's get down
to brass tacks.

01:29:50.268 --> 01:29:53.871
What do I get
if I turn state's evidence?

01:29:53.938 --> 01:29:56.841
You really want me to believe you
don't have anything to do with this?

01:29:56.908 --> 01:30:01.112
All you've told me is my wife's been
arrested for something involving coupons.

01:30:01.179 --> 01:30:03.014
What, she used
an expired coupon?

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:06.751
Well, your wife ran
an intricate financial scam

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:09.453
involving
over 240 companies,

01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:12.089
costing them tens of millions of
dollars, right under your nose.

01:30:12.156 --> 01:30:15.726
And you're an auditor for
the Internal Revenue Service.

01:30:17.862 --> 01:30:19.664
We have
separate bank accounts.

01:30:19.730 --> 01:30:21.532
I'm sorry,
what did you say the site was?

01:30:21.599 --> 01:30:25.102
It's Savvy Shopper
or some...

01:30:25.169 --> 01:30:28.739
No, it doesn't...
It does not ring a bell. I'm sorry.

01:30:28.806 --> 01:30:31.576
We recovered
your YouTube videos.

01:30:31.642 --> 01:30:36.747

01:30:47.692 --> 01:30:49.560
I thought
we deleted that shit.

01:30:49.627 --> 01:30:52.163
Have you ever heard the term,
"Savvy Super Saver"?

01:30:52.230 --> 01:30:55.066
- Well, quite obviously, yes.
- Okay.

01:30:57.101 --> 01:30:59.103
I want you
to go in there with me.

01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:01.906
What? Really?

01:31:01.973 --> 01:31:05.276
I think you understand this
woman more than I do, so yeah.

01:31:08.045 --> 01:31:09.780
Okay.

01:31:25.329 --> 01:31:26.864
Connie, this is Ken Miller.

01:31:26.931 --> 01:31:28.866
This is the, uh,
loss prevention officer

01:31:28.933 --> 01:31:32.003
that was pivotal
in tracking you down.

01:31:32.069 --> 01:31:35.873
- For starters, let's talk coupons.
- Okay.

01:31:37.208 --> 01:31:39.277
What do you wanna know?

01:31:39.343 --> 01:31:42.280
I mean, most people
undervalue coupons.

01:31:42.346 --> 01:31:45.082
I don't undervalue coupons.

01:31:45.816 --> 01:31:48.886
No. I guess you don't.

01:31:48.953 --> 01:31:51.155
I suppose that's why I'm here.

01:31:51.222 --> 01:31:53.024
But, you know, most people do.

01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:57.295
Well, here's what I think.
I think you preyed on people.

01:31:57.361 --> 01:32:02.667
I think nobody understands better than
you that people use coupons to save money

01:32:02.733 --> 01:32:05.803
or to buy things that they need,
and I think you took advantage of that.

01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:08.039
No. No, you're wrong.

01:32:08.105 --> 01:32:09.774
Tell me how I'm wrong.

01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:11.642
- That's not really why...
- That's not what...

01:32:11.709 --> 01:32:14.211
That's not really why people
use coupons.

01:32:14.278 --> 01:32:18.916
It's not about what you buy.
It's about the, uh... the feeling you get.

01:32:19.650 --> 01:32:20.952
They've done studies.

01:32:21.018 --> 01:32:23.788
When folks use coupons,
their oxytocin levels,

01:32:23.854 --> 01:32:27.325
they kinda spike and they get
that little tingly sensation.

01:32:27.391 --> 01:32:29.894
They call it
the "coupon high."

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:34.832
Supposedly, it's better than intimacy
with another person, or so I've been told.

01:32:36.834 --> 01:32:39.370
Sorry, I... I'm unclear.
Did you...

01:32:39.437 --> 01:32:42.139
Have you not used a coupon
or have you not had sex?

01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:45.109
T... What happened?

01:32:45.176 --> 01:32:49.613
No, that's... Oh, no.
This is not about me. This is about you.

01:32:49.680 --> 01:32:53.050
You... you had...
You had a good life, Connie.

01:32:53.117 --> 01:32:56.087
You had the nice house
and loving husband.

01:32:56.153 --> 01:32:58.389
Wha... Why... Why would you risk
losing all of that?

01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:05.396
I knew I was worth more.

01:33:05.463 --> 01:33:07.131
And what do you know
about my life?

01:33:07.198 --> 01:33:09.400
Just 'cause you've watched me
from a distance

01:33:09.467 --> 01:33:11.702
does not mean
you really know me.

01:33:12.737 --> 01:33:15.706
You happy with the life
that you're living?

01:33:15.773 --> 01:33:18.809
Haven't you ever wanted just
a little bit more out of life?

01:33:21.312 --> 01:33:23.848
Maybe we just value
different things.

01:33:25.449 --> 01:33:28.052
Well, I'll tell you what I value, Connie.
I value the law.

01:33:28.119 --> 01:33:30.654
Just because you want
a little more out of life

01:33:30.721 --> 01:33:33.124
does not give you an excuse
to break those laws.

01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:35.960
Now, it is not my job
to judge you.

01:33:36.027 --> 01:33:38.062
And you seem
like a nice enough lady.

01:33:38.129 --> 01:33:40.231
But I want to make sure
that you are grasping

01:33:40.297 --> 01:33:43.000
the gravity of the situation
that you're in.

01:33:43.067 --> 01:33:47.104
It is one year
for every $100,000 of fraud.

01:33:47.171 --> 01:33:50.674
So, with what you've stolen,
your sentencing is off the charts.

01:33:50.741 --> 01:33:53.811
You are facing
40 years to life.

01:33:54.779 --> 01:33:55.813
What?

01:33:58.349 --> 01:34:00.217
- Uh...
- Thank you.

01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:09.460
You should, uh, probably get
yourself a really good lawyer.

01:34:09.527 --> 01:34:13.230
And if I were you, I would
pay full price for this one.

01:34:24.075 --> 01:34:25.709
<i>They said 40 years to life.</i>

01:34:26.844 --> 01:34:28.813
Forty years to life?

01:34:28.879 --> 01:34:32.917
But they said that if I took full
responsibility for starting all of it,

01:34:32.983 --> 01:34:34.218
they would go easy on you.

01:34:34.285 --> 01:34:36.120
No, Connie.
What about you?

01:34:36.187 --> 01:34:38.856
I'm up a creek either way.
It doesn't...

01:34:40.124 --> 01:34:41.926
I did rope you into it,

01:34:41.992 --> 01:34:45.262
and if I can make it easier
on you, then...

01:34:45.329 --> 01:34:47.798
Can you believe they are
calling what we did fraud?

01:34:47.865 --> 01:34:49.500
I know, that's so stup...

01:34:49.567 --> 01:34:51.735
- It's like, we didn't defraud anybody.
- No.

01:34:52.903 --> 01:34:55.473
- Now, theft... Maybe. A little.
- Maybe theft. Maybe.

01:34:55.539 --> 01:34:57.141
Joanna Johnson?

01:34:57.208 --> 01:34:58.476
That's me. Hi.

01:34:58.542 --> 01:35:00.277
You made bail.
Let's go.

01:35:02.980 --> 01:35:04.348
Mama Josie.

01:35:09.587 --> 01:35:11.722
- Connie Kaminski?
- Ooh! That's me!

01:35:13.891 --> 01:35:16.160
- I made bail too?
- No. You got a visitor.

01:35:20.331 --> 01:35:21.832
What the fuck, Connie?

01:35:23.434 --> 01:35:25.503
I told you
that I stopped using coupons.

01:35:25.569 --> 01:35:28.539
I just didn't tell you
that I started selling them.

01:35:28.606 --> 01:35:30.274
Look, it's a good job.

01:35:30.341 --> 01:35:31.976
It's not a job!

01:35:32.042 --> 01:35:34.411
Would you...
Would you just bail me out?

01:35:34.478 --> 01:35:36.514
Oh, you don't have
a coupon for that?

01:35:40.017 --> 01:35:42.086
Rick, next time
you walk into a room

01:35:42.153 --> 01:35:44.321
and you think everyone there
is sorry to see you,

01:35:44.388 --> 01:35:46.257
just know it's not 'cause
you're an auditor.

01:35:46.323 --> 01:35:48.392
It's 'cause you're an asshole.

01:35:49.426 --> 01:35:51.328
I'd like a divorce.

01:36:12.316 --> 01:36:13.517
Earl?

01:36:14.618 --> 01:36:16.187
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:36:16.253 --> 01:36:18.455
- These are for you.
- I... Oh, thank you.

01:36:18.522 --> 01:36:20.524
I thought you
were my mama, so...

01:36:20.591 --> 01:36:23.928
Yeah, well, I think your mama's
cooperating with the authorities.

01:36:24.595 --> 01:36:26.997
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

01:36:27.064 --> 01:36:30.067
- Well, thank you. This is nice.
- You're welcome.

01:36:30.634 --> 01:36:32.536
How you doing?

01:36:32.603 --> 01:36:36.407
- Um... I'm doing. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:36:36.473 --> 01:36:38.042
Better days.

01:36:38.108 --> 01:36:39.610
Just got the official tally.

01:36:39.677 --> 01:36:43.180
Over 40 million dollars' worth
of counterfeit coupons.

01:36:43.247 --> 01:36:45.216
We traced it back
to a facility in Mexico,

01:36:45.282 --> 01:36:47.618
a US company
called Advanced Solutions.

01:36:47.685 --> 01:36:50.087
It's the same place that makes
the real coupons, yeah.

01:36:50.154 --> 01:36:52.189
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Used to be up in Michigan.

01:36:52.256 --> 01:36:55.960
Moved down to Mexico to save some money.
They got a factory overseas too.

01:36:56.026 --> 01:36:57.628
We know who their
Mexican counterparts were?

01:36:57.695 --> 01:37:00.431
Uh, yeah.
Advanced Solutions employees

01:37:00.497 --> 01:37:03.200
Alejandro and Rosa Diaz,
husband and wife.

01:37:03.267 --> 01:37:06.637
<i>One of Kaminski's
aliases would wire money orders</i>

01:37:06.704 --> 01:37:10.541
<i>totaling well over a million
dollars, and that's a lot of pesos.</i>

01:37:10.608 --> 01:37:12.376
Mexican government
gonna pursue 'em?

01:37:12.443 --> 01:37:14.245
Nope.
Trail's gone cold.

01:37:14.311 --> 01:37:16.981
Uh, when news of the arrests
broke, these two disappeared.

01:37:17.047 --> 01:37:19.883
They're probably sitting on a
beach somewhere drinking mai tais.

01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:22.987
<i>My lawyer,
this super expensive fella,</i>

01:37:23.053 --> 01:37:25.155
<i>sure had an interesting way
of looking at things.</i>

01:37:25.222 --> 01:37:27.992
All you did was take
advantage of a loophole.

01:37:28.058 --> 01:37:31.428
These corporations you're accused of
exploiting use loopholes all the time

01:37:31.495 --> 01:37:33.197
and take advantage
of a broken system.

01:37:33.264 --> 01:37:35.132
<i>He always liked to say...</i>

01:37:35.199 --> 01:37:38.002
Just because someone says
something, doesn't make it true.

01:37:38.068 --> 01:37:40.170
<i>The funny thing is,
whenever he said it,</i>

01:37:40.237 --> 01:37:42.406
<i>most everyone
took it to be fact.</i>

01:37:42.473 --> 01:37:47.911
My client is just following the
lead of a successful corporation.

01:37:47.978 --> 01:37:50.247
Will the defendants
please rise?

01:37:53.617 --> 01:37:56.053
Through all this,
I've learned more about coupons

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:59.256
and America's shopping habits
than I ever cared to know.

01:37:59.323 --> 01:38:04.628
The court has considered the nature
and circumstances of the offense

01:38:04.695 --> 01:38:09.500
in arriving at a sentence for Ms.
Johnson and Mrs. Kaminski.

01:38:11.235 --> 01:38:14.071
The court sentences
the defendant Joanna Johnson

01:38:14.138 --> 01:38:19.043
to ten days in jail suspended
and one-year probation.

01:38:20.444 --> 01:38:23.347
As for the defendant,
Connie Kaminski,

01:38:23.414 --> 01:38:27.418
she will be incarcerated in the
Arizona Department of Corrections

01:38:27.484 --> 01:38:32.690
for a term of 11 months,
with the possibility of parole.

01:38:32.756 --> 01:38:34.725
That's all.

01:38:34.792 --> 01:38:36.026
Oh, my G...

01:38:36.627 --> 01:38:38.128
Well, lookee there.

01:38:38.195 --> 01:38:40.964
First time in history
a Black woman gets off

01:38:41.031 --> 01:38:43.734
and a white woman gets to do
some time.

01:38:43.801 --> 01:38:46.036
<i>That loss
prevention guy was right.</i>

01:38:46.103 --> 01:38:47.738
<i>You get what you pay for.</i>

01:38:47.805 --> 01:38:49.573
<i>Not 40 years to life. Just...</i>

01:38:49.640 --> 01:38:52.142
Eleven fucking months!

01:38:52.209 --> 01:38:55.245
All right. Look,
you didn't hear this from me,

01:38:55.312 --> 01:38:59.416
but we may have received multiple
phone calls from numerous corporations,

01:38:59.483 --> 01:39:02.086
saying, you know, uh,
"We don't want our logo on the news.

01:39:02.152 --> 01:39:04.021
- Our shareholders... Keep it quiet."
- Oh, God.

01:39:04.088 --> 01:39:06.323
Bottom line, they just
want this to go away.

01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:08.559
The damage she's done, we're gonna
throw the rules out the window?

01:39:08.625 --> 01:39:12.329
They don't matter?
She cost P&G alone $80 million.

01:39:12.396 --> 01:39:15.466
For P&G and for every other
company, this was just a write-off.

01:39:15.532 --> 01:39:18.068
And, uh, it'll probably be
eight with good behavior.

01:39:18.135 --> 01:39:19.770
Oh, God.

01:39:19.837 --> 01:39:22.740
Oh, my God.
I-I just... I don't get it.

01:39:22.806 --> 01:39:26.310
So, uh, you're telling me that's it?
Move on, it's over?

01:39:26.377 --> 01:39:28.379
Well, that's all there is.
That's law enforcement.

01:39:28.445 --> 01:39:31.782
You just do the best that you can, Ken.
You try to be fair.

01:39:31.849 --> 01:39:35.652
You follow the law and if everything
goes well, you get to go home safe,

01:39:35.719 --> 01:39:39.256
and hopefully to someone
that you love.

01:39:39.323 --> 01:39:41.358
Which reminds me,
I need to call my wife.

01:39:42.192 --> 01:39:43.594
See you later.

01:39:47.598 --> 01:39:50.634
- Oh, one more thing.
- Wow.

01:39:51.735 --> 01:39:53.704
I almost forgot.

01:39:59.643 --> 01:40:04.615
Dated December 3rd, 1918.

01:40:04.681 --> 01:40:09.453
"My dearest Leo,
when word arrived from Pastor Holbrook

01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:11.588
that your injuries
were not life-threatening,

01:40:11.655 --> 01:40:14.491
and that you were on your way
back home to us,

01:40:14.558 --> 01:40:16.693
my heart leapt from my chest.

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:22.433
Our little Irene could not decipher
my tears as those of pure joy.

01:40:22.499 --> 01:40:26.603
My only hope now is that you receive
this letter before you depart,

01:40:26.670 --> 01:40:29.840
and that my words
will accompany you

01:40:29.907 --> 01:40:31.809
on your arduous journey
back home.

01:40:31.875 --> 01:40:35.479
With grace,
faith and love. Mary."

01:40:37.748 --> 01:40:39.082
This one's for you.

01:40:39.516 --> 01:40:43.086
What? Really?

01:40:43.153 --> 01:40:47.391
- Oh... Not the letter.
- You can't separate the letters.

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:49.827
What good would the letters be
if they weren't together?

01:40:49.893 --> 01:40:51.728
- Right.
- The letters are kind of archival.

01:40:51.795 --> 01:40:54.198
What I mean is that
this lesson is for you.

01:40:55.265 --> 01:40:57.301
The lesson's for you, Ken.

01:40:57.935 --> 01:40:59.636
You're a good man.

01:40:59.703 --> 01:41:01.538
I enjoyed working
alongside you.

01:41:03.707 --> 01:41:06.643
Don't go searching for too much.
You're pretty great the way you are.

01:41:28.699 --> 01:41:31.335
Could you just make
an exception?

01:41:34.304 --> 01:41:37.374
Uh, honor it.
Yeah. Give her a discount.

01:41:38.442 --> 01:41:40.177
<i>You may be asking yourself,</i>

01:41:40.244 --> 01:41:42.779
<i>"Who won and who lost
through all of this?"</i>

01:41:44.448 --> 01:41:47.718
<i>And I guess that's
really for you to decide.</i>

01:41:48.752 --> 01:41:50.420
Yes!

01:41:52.222 --> 01:41:53.690
<i>Rick and I got a divorce.</i>

01:41:53.757 --> 01:41:56.860
<i>So, yeah.
I guess I lost my husband.</i>

01:41:56.927 --> 01:41:59.663
<i>But not in the way
you lose something important,</i>

01:41:59.730 --> 01:42:02.399
<i>like your car keys or your cell
phone or something like that.</i>

01:42:03.734 --> 01:42:06.436
- Please, take it all.
- I just wanna get rid of it.

01:42:06.503 --> 01:42:08.438
Definitely don't need those.

01:42:08.505 --> 01:42:10.874
Ah, careful now. You don't know
what you need till it's gone.

01:42:10.941 --> 01:42:13.410
Sage advice. You get that
from your parole officer?

01:42:15.012 --> 01:42:17.447
<i>And after paying
the fancy lawyer,</i>

01:42:17.514 --> 01:42:21.385
<i>we still have
a little money left over.</i>

01:42:21.451 --> 01:42:25.722
<i>As for JoJo, she finally figured
out exactly what Earl was thinking.</i>

01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:31.662
<i>Have you ever been
to Montenegro?</i>

01:42:32.462 --> 01:42:33.497
We need that guy.

01:42:33.564 --> 01:42:35.265
Why that guy?

01:42:35.332 --> 01:42:37.200
'Cause he's
already bending the rules.

01:42:37.267 --> 01:42:40.671
<i>JoJo says I'm gonna love it
when I get there.</i>

01:42:40.737 --> 01:42:43.640
<i>In fact, she's already found
the perfect spot</i>

01:42:43.707 --> 01:42:46.710
<i>for our new
and improved business.</i>

01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:55.485
<i>Oh, and did you know Montenegro
has no extradition to the US?</i>

01:42:58.922 --> 01:43:02.292
<i>If you ever find yourself
doing a stretch in the slammer,</i>

01:43:02.359 --> 01:43:04.728
<i>you should still try to make
every day count.</i>

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:11.935
<i>Especially your last day.</i>

01:43:20.344 --> 01:43:22.613
<i>Sometimes you look back
and you think,</i>

01:43:22.679 --> 01:43:26.683
<i>"Well, if that didn't happen and that
didn't happen and that didn't happen,</i>

01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:28.885
<i>I wouldn't be who I am today."</i>

01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:35.926
Betcha I can walk a mile
faster than you can run one.

01:43:44.568 --> 01:43:46.770
<i>And it turns out,</i>

01:43:46.837 --> 01:43:48.872
<i>it really doesn't matter how
you get to the finish line.</i>

01:43:48.939 --> 01:43:51.508
<i>Just as long as you get there.</i>

01:44:22.487 --> 01:44:27.487
