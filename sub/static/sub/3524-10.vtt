<i>- There ain't no bear back there.
- Felas!</i>

01:53.379 --> 01:57.145
<i>Wel, the way l feel right now,
l'd like to meet a bear.</i>

01:57.250 --> 01:59.377
<i>What would you do if you did meet him?</i>

01:59.452 --> 02:02.717
<i>That bear would have just as much chance
as this pork chop.</i>

02:06.926 --> 02:09.793
<i>Where you boys al going? lt ain't over.</i>

02:12.165 --> 02:15.623
<i>Somebody's going to get something
they ain't expecting.</i>

02:26.779 --> 02:28.178
<i>Have a bite.</i>

02:46.766 --> 02:48.165
<i>Look out, here he comes!</i>

02:58.178 --> 02:59.440
Where's Furio?

02:59.546 --> 03:02.811
He couldn't get a flight out of Rome,
so I'm driving again today.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.214
Come on in, he'll be right down.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.127
No coffee. I gotta go. Okay?

03:26.606 --> 03:29.871
- What did you do to your hair?
- I cut it. What do you think?

03:29.943 --> 03:34.403
I thought we agreed that you'd talk to me
before doing something to your hair.

03:34.647 --> 03:36.615
What do you think of it?

03:39.953 --> 03:42.319
- It's short.
- Good, he eats his carrots.

03:44.023 --> 03:46.958
- Makes you look younger.
- Benny's waiting for you.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.493
All right. Well, here.

03:53.700 --> 03:55.292
<i>You fat honey dripper.</i>

03:55.468 --> 03:59.461
<i>Come up with the rest of our money,
or l'l strip the lard off your ugly...</i>

04:01.074 --> 04:02.268
<i>Pretty.</i>

04:10.984 --> 04:12.952
Cosette? Come on, Mommy.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.310
Let's go for a walk.

04:19.192 --> 04:21.524
- Where's the dog?
- You shut the TV?

04:24.664 --> 04:26.029
Where's the dog?

04:28.534 --> 04:30.297
Oh, my God! Cosette.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.666
- What?
- Christopher!

04:33.072 --> 04:35.336
She's not breathing. Her neck feels broken.

04:35.408 --> 04:36.636
What the fuck?

04:36.709 --> 04:38.734
Oh, my God, she's dead!

04:42.081 --> 04:43.878
- I fell asleep.
- What?

04:44.884 --> 04:47.148
She must've crawled under there for warmth.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.085
Are you fucking crazy?

04:49.789 --> 04:51.450
You fucking killed her!

04:51.524 --> 04:54.391
- I didn't kill her. I must have sat on her.
- Jesus.

04:55.662 --> 04:58.222
- My poor baby.
- I'm sorry.

04:58.431 --> 05:00.558
It was an accident, for Christ's sake.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.162
How long have I said
she shouldn't be on the furniture?

05:05.238 --> 05:07.968
It's because you were
fucking high, Christopher.

05:08.474 --> 05:11.705
You and your fucking smack! Fuck!

05:12.745 --> 05:13.939
Lifestyle.

05:14.414 --> 05:17.781
- I'll get you another dog.
- I don't want another dog!

05:22.455 --> 05:24.753
- Four in the side.
- One up the ass.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.998
So nobody's heard from Ralph?

05:33.266 --> 05:34.858
I'm starting to worry.

05:35.702 --> 05:38.603
- I'll call him again.
- Try the gay man's choir.

05:39.038 --> 05:41.336
I read they were having tryouts today.

05:41.741 --> 05:43.641
Three ball, far corner.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.068
Son of a bitch.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.404
Where you been?

05:50.283 --> 05:53.252
This was in the mail
for you outside, Tony. UPS.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.754
- What's going on?
- He's calling Ralph.

05:56.823 --> 05:59.121
<i>Leave a message
and leave your phone number.</i>

05:59.192 --> 06:02.286
<i>With my schedule,
l cannot look up phone numbers.</i>

06:02.729 --> 06:04.424
Answering machine, again.

06:04.997 --> 06:06.225
You're up, T.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.961
How you doing? Feeling all right?

06:10.269 --> 06:12.794
Me? Yeah, great.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.706
Fuck.

06:25.017 --> 06:26.416
What's that, Ton'?

06:26.486 --> 06:28.818
That's Tony and Ralph's horse, Pie-O-My.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.583
Where you going? Your shot.

06:37.029 --> 06:38.690
What are you doing?

06:38.965 --> 06:41.126
That's a forfeit. That's our money.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.807
<i>- Bing.
- Get rid of that fucking picture.</i>

06:52.879 --> 06:55.643
<i>- What? You don't want to...
- You hear me? Burn it!</i>

06:55.815 --> 06:58.750
I never want to see the fucking thing again!

07:22.708 --> 07:23.697
What?

07:44.630 --> 07:47.155
What's with Ralph?
Fucking Bermuda Triangle?

07:47.233 --> 07:50.532
This shit with his kid.
He's probably down in the bunker.

07:50.603 --> 07:53.231
I'll tell you. If I didn't know better...

07:55.475 --> 07:58.706
- We're off the record here, Albert.
- We're off the record?

07:59.178 --> 08:00.509
It's Tony.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.477
What? Am I wrong?

08:06.085 --> 08:07.985
Honestly? I don't know.

08:10.556 --> 08:11.955
Take a leak.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.460
This is bad, my friend.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

08:21.534 --> 08:24.094
I wouldn't piss on this Ralph
if he was on fire.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.298
But to whack the guy over a horse?
How fucked up is that?

08:27.373 --> 08:30.137
If it can happen to him,
it can happen to any of us.

08:30.209 --> 08:32.972
What's next? You get clipped
for wearing the wrong shoes?

08:33.044 --> 08:36.879
What can you do? Tony's the boss.
Centuries of tradition here.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.711
Exactly my point. If Tony did do this...

08:40.119 --> 08:42.553
whack Ralph over a fucking horse...

08:43.188 --> 08:46.989
that guy would be the first guy on line
to pull his fucking plug.

09:10.983 --> 09:13.645
I think Justin recognized me
a few minutes ago.

09:19.158 --> 09:20.250
Thank you.

09:30.202 --> 09:32.136
Come in, he's getting dressed.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.129
I'll wait in the car.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.110
Well, welcome back.

09:40.279 --> 09:41.769
I bring presents.

09:42.448 --> 09:44.177
Really? That is so sweet.

09:45.651 --> 09:48.984
Also, for the grownups,
I bring some of my uncle's wine...

09:49.488 --> 09:50.819
but it's come later.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.949
I just made some coffee. Are you sure?

09:53.025 --> 09:55.016
Thank you, but I wait in the car.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.411
What's the matter with you?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.186
I'm sad for my father.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.589
All right, but you gotta get over it.

11:05.264 --> 11:07.232
So I unwrap the paper...

11:07.600 --> 11:09.192
and there she is...

11:11.303 --> 11:14.033
with her head held high
and her ears perked up.

11:15.274 --> 11:17.174
And there I am smiling.

11:18.778 --> 11:20.245
What happened then?

11:23.582 --> 11:25.812
Still, I gotta be the sad clown.

11:25.885 --> 11:28.786
A front for my friends, my family.

11:30.222 --> 11:31.849
You know, a brave front.

11:31.924 --> 11:34.757
I've heard you describe yourself this way.

11:35.261 --> 11:36.523
The sad clown.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.464
I've never seen it.

11:39.598 --> 11:42.465
Carmela also painted
a very different picture.

11:42.601 --> 11:43.966
What do you mean?

11:44.070 --> 11:46.800
Volatile, punching the walls.

11:47.673 --> 11:50.073
Compulsive gorging on food.

11:51.911 --> 11:55.278
Kind of a far cry from the seltzer bottle
and bicycle horn.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.879
I'm sorry.

11:57.149 --> 12:00.380
Maybe you'd like Carmela to be here,
if I'm so fucking obnoxious.

12:00.453 --> 12:04.082
What I'm trying to establish
is your response to sadness...

12:04.223 --> 12:06.316
is usually rage, not humor.

12:06.492 --> 12:10.326
You two don't have to trouble yourselves.
Because I doubled my dosage.

12:10.496 --> 12:13.932
I don't want you
taking 80 milligrams of Prozac.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.763
You kick it up to 80 for a week, 10 days...

12:17.203 --> 12:20.001
just to pull back on the stick,
get the nose up...

12:20.372 --> 12:24.103
then you duck back down to 40
before the limp dick thing sets in.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.704
One: That's ineffective.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.741
Two: It's not a treatment for grief.

12:34.787 --> 12:36.448
Let's get back to Pie-O-My.

12:37.490 --> 12:40.323
It's sad that you've lost something
that you love.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.387
That being said...

12:43.095 --> 12:45.859
- it is a horse.
- What the fuck is the matter with you?

12:45.931 --> 12:49.128
The only other time you've become
this emotional in here...

12:50.603 --> 12:53.902
- it was those ducks.
- That was a whole different thing.

12:53.973 --> 12:56.601
- They were ducks.
- Is it different?

12:56.809 --> 12:59.710
You haven't grieved in this way for people.

13:00.312 --> 13:02.109
Your mother, your best friend.

13:02.181 --> 13:06.777
Can't I just be sad for a horse
without some touchy-feely...

13:07.219 --> 13:09.619
Freudian shit component to it?

13:10.122 --> 13:13.285
When it was the ducks,
it embodied feelings of dread...

13:13.359 --> 13:16.624
about your family, that something terrible
was going to happen.

13:16.695 --> 13:18.629
It's just the miserable way she died.

13:18.697 --> 13:22.463
It just makes me wonder
what kind of fucking toilet world we live in.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.526
A friend of the family, little boy...

13:24.603 --> 13:28.164
gets shot with an arrow,
cuts off the flow of blood to his brain.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.140
Thirteen years old.

13:30.209 --> 13:33.042
He's going to live,
but he's never gonna be right.

13:33.212 --> 13:35.612
- How awful for the parents.
- Yeah.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.616
My nephew.
I love that kid like I love my son.

13:42.922 --> 13:45.857
But I think he's got a drug problem, heroin.

13:47.393 --> 13:51.489
It kills me just to say it, because I got
so many hopes tied up in this kid.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.197
This is Christopher?

13:53.265 --> 13:56.462
This 9l11 shit, I don't know.
The shit that's going on everywhere.

13:56.535 --> 13:59.333
It's like some fucking asshole
is stalking the human race.

13:59.405 --> 14:03.068
Anthony, do any of your associates
think about any of this?

14:03.242 --> 14:05.506
I don't know, we don't talk about it.

14:14.119 --> 14:18.852
I know it's fucking ridiculous, but I feel like
the reverend Rodney King Jr., you know?

14:18.924 --> 14:22.291
- "Why can't we all just get along?"
- What's ridiculous about it?

14:22.361 --> 14:25.660
Come on, don't jerk me off.
This is me you're talking to.

14:27.733 --> 14:30.998
You've caused much suffering yourself,
haven't you?

14:39.011 --> 14:40.535
My wife prays to God.

14:42.314 --> 14:44.544
What kind of God does this shit?

14:47.253 --> 14:49.448
How about Carmine Lupertazzi?

14:50.022 --> 14:53.321
Christopher ever talk about a dinner
with him and Tony last July?

14:54.360 --> 14:56.157
What's the matter, Adriana?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.560
You and Christopher arguing?

14:58.998 --> 15:01.626
It's a stressful time, right before a wedding.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.732
A lot of guys get cold feet.

15:03.802 --> 15:06.635
He's fucking stoned on H all the time, okay?

15:07.940 --> 15:09.407
There, you happy?

15:11.477 --> 15:14.173
We put you guys
on the mailing list for Hazelden.

15:14.246 --> 15:15.474
That rehab shit?

15:15.547 --> 15:18.209
That's where all the brochures
are coming from? From you?

15:18.284 --> 15:21.344
Convince him he needs help,
that he should be in rehab.

15:27.459 --> 15:30.223
Look at you, with that little face.

15:40.506 --> 15:44.840
These flat screens,
I'll tell you, no glare, high definition.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.912
<i>I was watching On the Waterfront
down at Sears.</i>

15:47.980 --> 15:51.313
Karl Malden's nose hairs
looked like fucking BX cables.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.447
Voice mail again.

15:57.356 --> 16:00.348
Chrissy, we're down here
waiting for the TVs.

16:01.994 --> 16:03.518
Let me ask you something.

16:03.595 --> 16:06.223
The other day, T with that picture...

16:07.066 --> 16:09.330
he looked like he was going to cry.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.338
Still no word from Ralph.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.405
Where the fuck is this kid?

16:35.294 --> 16:37.023
What you want around here?

16:37.296 --> 16:39.662
- Can you do an eighth of scag?
- $500.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.126
Yeah, wrap it up.

16:43.035 --> 16:46.698
- Get the fuck out the car, bitch!
- Motherfucker, you know who I am?

16:46.939 --> 16:48.463
Who the fuck is this?

16:52.978 --> 16:54.639
You know who the fuck I'm with?

16:54.713 --> 16:57.204
You ain't no fucking cop, that's for sure.

16:58.584 --> 17:02.350
- The fuck you going to do with that?
- Stick it up your mother's twat!

17:12.498 --> 17:13.931
Goddamn it!

17:15.034 --> 17:16.126
What?

17:17.502 --> 17:20.563
Little piece of shit.
The cork, it got stuck in the bottle.

17:20.638 --> 17:21.731
Homemade crap.

17:21.807 --> 17:26.243
That somebody cared enough about to carry
all the way from the old country for you.

17:29.681 --> 17:31.444
What a fucking week.

17:32.518 --> 17:35.885
I talked to Ronnie, asked her
if she's even heard from Ralph.

17:36.655 --> 17:40.022
Little fucking kid's
got a respiratory infection now.

17:41.527 --> 17:44.519
She just heard about Pie-O-My,
she's sick about it.

17:46.765 --> 17:49.461
Hello? We're talking about Justin here.

17:50.769 --> 17:54.000
Sorry, I was thinking about my mother,
her skin condition.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.079
Oh, my God. Did I forget to take that out?

18:05.150 --> 18:06.742
What's wrong with you?

18:08.053 --> 18:10.021
Really, Ma. Dad's right.

18:10.255 --> 18:13.019
It's not a bad drive.
It's interstate up to Boston.

18:13.092 --> 18:17.620
If you don't want to accompany me, fine.
Your sister can come up from Florida.

18:17.696 --> 18:20.927
Come on, she's not going to do that.
Of course I'll go.

18:23.836 --> 18:26.361
Did she tell you, Hugh? My horse died.

18:26.905 --> 18:28.202
Pie-O-My?

18:28.507 --> 18:29.804
That's too bad.

18:30.442 --> 18:33.275
- God, this wine.
- There was a fire at the stables.

18:33.378 --> 18:36.108
She had to be destroyed.
You should've seen her.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.416
String beans, Hugh?

18:44.123 --> 18:47.388
- Baby, what happened?
- He got jacked by some spics.

18:47.626 --> 18:52.029
- They took his ride, his fucking watch, too.
- Jesus Christ, the Cartier?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.932
- Christopher, you're bleeding.
- Stop touching it.

18:59.905 --> 19:02.806
- Do you think I could get some money?
- What?

19:04.076 --> 19:05.839
- Who are you?
- Eddie.

19:06.712 --> 19:09.146
- From down the park.
- He's good people, Adriana.

19:09.214 --> 19:12.342
I took him home. He was all fucked up,
but I straightened him out.

19:12.417 --> 19:13.850
He owes me $30.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.977
- Get the fuck out of here.
- What?

19:17.389 --> 19:18.856
Get out of my house.

19:20.592 --> 19:23.220
- Don't stiff me on this, man.
- Get out!

19:25.230 --> 19:27.596
What's the matter with you?
The guy's my friend.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.133
That's your friend?

19:35.741 --> 19:39.108
- Hazelden? What's this?
- It came for you in the mail.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.236
Recovery?

19:44.216 --> 19:46.912
You put me on mailing lists
for junkies, now?

19:48.987 --> 19:51.114
Where do you get your balls?

20:07.306 --> 20:10.469
- What are you doing?
- What? Sil said torch it.

20:14.446 --> 20:18.246
A classy piece like this?
Horse with the trees, wooden frame?

20:19.017 --> 20:21.247
$25,000 to $30,000 at a minimum.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.949
I think it was Tony said
he wanted it burnt, Paulie, specifically.

20:25.190 --> 20:28.353
- Put it in my car, I'll take it home.
- All right.

20:28.527 --> 20:31.257
It'd be an honor to hang this picture
in my house.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.990
Tony, can you come down here, please?

20:37.035 --> 20:38.696
What's the matter?

20:44.509 --> 20:46.704
- What happened?
- Your nephew.

20:48.380 --> 20:50.780
Christopher did this? He hit you?

20:52.417 --> 20:53.475
What for?

20:53.552 --> 20:55.747
- What's the difference?
- He was high.

20:56.288 --> 20:59.280
Little prick, I'm going to wring
his fucking neck. Where is he?

20:59.358 --> 21:01.588
He's been using drugs. Heroin.

21:06.431 --> 21:08.763
<i>- Who's this?
- You caled me, maricon.</i>

21:09.835 --> 21:12.303
<i>- Where's Christopher, asshole?
- Fuck your mother.</i>

21:12.371 --> 21:16.467
His car was stolen by some Puerto Ricans.
They took his cell phone, too.

21:16.808 --> 21:18.503
I don't know what to do.

21:18.644 --> 21:21.204
I already packed a suitcase
for my aunt's in Daytona.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.942
Take it easy.
Don't do something you'll regret.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.041
Three weeks before their wedding.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.348
Maybe he needs to be in rehab.

21:28.887 --> 21:31.685
You can hire someone
to do an intervention, apparently.

21:31.757 --> 21:34.157
Girls, come on. We're a family here.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.194
Now I gotta spell it out for you?

21:42.467 --> 21:45.732
Take it easy.
Let me figure out how to handle this.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.033
Please, don't hurt him.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.597
<i>...fight plan wil win out.</i>

22:18.937 --> 22:22.202
<i>At this stage the fight
is getting closer because...</i>

22:25.410 --> 22:27.878
Why am I always having to come here?

22:35.787 --> 22:38.688
- How are you doing, man?
- Did we come at a bad time?

22:39.958 --> 22:41.482
The decorating ideas.

22:42.127 --> 22:43.617
You want to come in?

22:48.400 --> 22:49.799
I'm sorry for the mess.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.264
Please, this is nothing.

22:53.505 --> 22:56.565
<i>So, there is a page from Metropolitan Home.</i>

22:57.142 --> 23:01.306
Now, wait till you see how
a mirrored backsplash can amplify a room.

23:03.715 --> 23:05.876
You want something? Something to drink?

23:05.951 --> 23:07.111
We gotta go.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.283
If you've got a cup of coffee.

23:14.893 --> 23:17.862
<i>- He loved that little man, by the way.
- Gobbetto.</i>

23:19.398 --> 23:20.490
He's good luck.

23:20.565 --> 23:24.092
Not that he remembered to thank you.
And Meadow loved that book.

23:25.871 --> 23:29.034
You know, I feel bad.
I didn't give you something.

23:29.741 --> 23:33.040
I bring something,
but I forgot it when I left that morning.

23:36.415 --> 23:41.079
Balsamic vinegar, 35 years.
From my sister's husband's family.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.110
Live in Modena.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.561
So, aside from your Dad...

23:51.696 --> 23:55.598
- was it wonderful being back in Italy?
- It was wonderful, yeah.

23:56.802 --> 23:59.293
Go home and see your friends, your family.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.035
I gotta be honest...

24:03.008 --> 24:04.475
it was not so nice.

24:05.410 --> 24:07.970
- I don't belong there no more.
- No?

24:08.313 --> 24:09.712
Something change.

24:10.682 --> 24:13.048
- Maybe me.
- What do you mean?

24:14.686 --> 24:17.177
I'm like a visitor in my own town.

24:17.756 --> 24:19.417
Life went on without me.

24:20.725 --> 24:22.625
There is nothing there for me now.

24:22.694 --> 24:26.391
- No special someone?
- I feel strange to live here also.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.598
Maybe I should never have come to America.

24:30.669 --> 24:33.263
You've made such a nice life
for yourself, though.

24:33.338 --> 24:35.101
You've got a wonderful home.

24:35.173 --> 24:36.902
- A girlfriend.
- No.

24:36.975 --> 24:39.205
What do you mean, no? Jessica?

24:42.848 --> 24:44.839
I try to talk to her...

24:45.717 --> 24:48.015
but there is no communication.

24:48.753 --> 24:51.654
Like with some people,
you know what I mean?

24:54.960 --> 24:58.054
<i>- That's what love is built on.
- Sì.</i>

25:02.501 --> 25:04.230
So why did you come back?

25:05.637 --> 25:09.129
You said you'd take me to CompUSA
so I could get a new Magic Stick.

25:09.207 --> 25:10.367
And I will.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.740
I got stuff to do. I told you.

25:16.448 --> 25:17.972
I'd better get going.

25:18.750 --> 25:21.275
Thank you very much for the vinegar.

25:41.673 --> 25:44.301
Where's Branca? She jump ship already?

25:45.176 --> 25:48.009
She's in hospital for a while. Cyst.

25:51.149 --> 25:53.982
Where's the old fart? I gotta talk to him.

25:54.319 --> 25:57.413
It's his afternoon nap.
You want me to wake him?

25:59.157 --> 26:00.749
Give him a while.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.626
Want some wine?
From Furio's uncle in Italy?

26:13.104 --> 26:15.629
He says they had a lot of sun in this year.

26:16.875 --> 26:17.842
<i>Salute.</i>

26:23.415 --> 26:24.882
It needs ice.

26:31.456 --> 26:33.549
I'm going to watch the Bloomberg.

26:41.933 --> 26:45.460
- What's all that?
- I'm making a website for my business.

26:47.305 --> 26:48.932
You know how to do that?

26:49.007 --> 26:51.271
I'm going to pay somebody...

26:51.810 --> 26:55.075
$35 an hour? I stuck, I call Bill.

26:56.581 --> 26:58.378
You got married yet?

26:58.617 --> 27:02.075
Maybe when he gets back
from Port St. Lucie.

27:02.921 --> 27:05.412
The baseball spring training for his Mets.

27:08.693 --> 27:10.456
That Bill's a lucky man.

27:12.430 --> 27:16.366
You Russians, you got all the angles,
you come over here, you bust your ass.

27:16.434 --> 27:17.833
People are people.

27:20.205 --> 27:23.732
Look at you.
You got every excuse to be in the bottle...

27:23.875 --> 27:26.537
and here you are designing websites.

27:27.679 --> 27:29.613
What do you mean? What excuse?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.815
- Your...
- No, what?

27:35.654 --> 27:37.645
Come on, you know, that...

27:38.189 --> 27:39.383
My leg.

27:40.425 --> 27:41.756
Of course.

27:42.160 --> 27:44.458
I don't think of it right away.

27:48.733 --> 27:50.223
There are worse things.

27:50.301 --> 27:52.895
<i>...digital countdown timer
with automatic shut-off.</i>

27:52.971 --> 27:55.997
<i>Simply put your food in
and set the timer, walk away.</i>

27:56.074 --> 27:58.702
<i>Your new George Foreman Gril
wil tel you exactly...</i>

27:58.777 --> 28:01.507
<i>when your food is griled to perfection.</i>

28:01.880 --> 28:03.905
<i>This gril does al the work for you.</i>

28:03.982 --> 28:07.782
<i>With my exclusive 20-minute
digital countdown timer with auto...</i>

28:08.253 --> 28:10.653
Heroin, you got only one option.

28:10.755 --> 28:15.249
A dog you love catches rabies,
you put her out of its misery, Anthony.

28:18.697 --> 28:19.686
<i>Salute.</i>

28:31.476 --> 28:33.205
So what do I do, Uncle Jun'?

28:33.278 --> 28:36.907
The feds get him in his condition,
who knows what he's liable to say.

28:37.248 --> 28:39.808
You go on trial, like me,
you won't sleep at night.

28:39.884 --> 28:42.079
All the more reason to clean him up.

28:46.024 --> 28:47.548
Still, he's...

28:48.259 --> 28:51.319
He's a major liability.
If it were anybody else...

28:54.299 --> 28:56.597
It reminds me of people's feet.

29:01.005 --> 29:03.838
I don't know if I can do that other thing.

29:04.509 --> 29:06.602
Dominic Palladino, do you remember him?

29:06.678 --> 29:09.647
- B&E guy, a real juicer.
- He's in AA now.

29:09.981 --> 29:12.575
I thought maybe I'd give him a call.

29:13.551 --> 29:15.451
They can treat this shit nowadays.

29:15.520 --> 29:19.081
Me with the competency hearings.
You with the head shrinkers.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.589
This one in rehab now.

29:26.931 --> 29:30.094
I was so upset when he didn't bring me
a present back from Italy.

29:30.168 --> 29:32.363
He got something for A.J. And for Meadow.

29:32.971 --> 29:36.202
He gave me some vinegar,
but I don't think it was meant for me.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.572
It must've meant something, that he felt bad.

29:38.643 --> 29:41.203
Carmela, you sound like you're 15 years old.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.543
I say I'm helping him decorate.

29:43.615 --> 29:46.140
I bring A.J. With me.
Now even he smells a rat.

29:47.118 --> 29:50.952
If Tony suspects one iota,
you know what'll happen to Furio.

29:51.022 --> 29:54.014
These guys are living in a different century.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.853
- It didn't stop you.
- Steve at the gym?

29:58.096 --> 30:01.395
I felt so guilty all the time.
The lies and the sneaking.

30:02.033 --> 30:05.093
It took Jackie going in the hospital
to get me to stop.

30:06.337 --> 30:09.500
- We haven't slept together yet.
- You're not fucking him?

30:09.974 --> 30:12.067
So this isn't really real.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.338
It is real.

30:15.446 --> 30:16.970
We communicate.

30:17.382 --> 30:19.816
He looks at me like I'm beautiful.

30:20.018 --> 30:22.578
He thinks I'm interesting when I talk.

30:23.121 --> 30:27.023
Just those few minutes
when we see each other, I live for those.

30:28.393 --> 30:32.557
I feel like my life is slipping through
my fingers and I will never be happy.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.629
If you haven't slept with him yet, don't.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.894
And don't go over there anymore.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.047
We're all here?

30:55.553 --> 30:56.645
Good afternoon.

30:56.721 --> 30:59.281
For those of you who don't know me,
I am Dominic...

30:59.357 --> 31:01.291
and I'm an alcoholic and an addict.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.224
Don't forget "scumbag. "

31:04.395 --> 31:06.420
As some of you obviously don't know...

31:06.497 --> 31:09.364
I've also been in recovery now
going on four years.

31:09.868 --> 31:13.235
I joined AA in prison,
and frankly, it saved my life.

31:14.706 --> 31:18.301
Okay, now, we're all here today
because we have one thing in common.

31:18.376 --> 31:21.743
Not only do we share
a certain background and culture...

31:21.813 --> 31:25.374
we care about Chris and want to help him
with his heroin addiction.

31:26.150 --> 31:29.210
Any one of you been involved
in an intervention before?

31:37.762 --> 31:40.595
Caught our daughter
smoking pot once, but...

31:40.665 --> 31:42.496
- Not really, no.
- No problem.

31:42.700 --> 31:45.692
An intervention
is a non-judgmental confrontation.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.369
A "care-frontation," we call it.

31:49.841 --> 31:53.242
Now, what I need from you guys
is to make a list of specific times...

31:53.311 --> 31:56.109
where Christopher's drug use
impacted on you directly.

31:58.516 --> 32:00.484
For example, Adriana, is it?

32:01.619 --> 32:03.519
You would say something like this:

32:03.588 --> 32:06.921
"Christopher, last Monday you came home
from work high...

32:06.991 --> 32:10.119
"and belligerent,
and you were physically abusive to me. "

32:11.296 --> 32:13.526
What if he's high when we try to talk to him?

32:13.631 --> 32:15.258
Then we wait till he's sober.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.927
My first intervention, Steven Patrano
waited 10 hours for me to sober up.

32:19.003 --> 32:22.461
- Your first intervention?
- In 1997, I suffered a relapse.

32:22.674 --> 32:26.906
As in heroin addiction, alcoholics
suffer a fairly high recidivism rate.

32:27.211 --> 32:30.510
Great. So he's taking advice
from a two-time loser.

32:31.349 --> 32:33.544
There are no losers in recovery.

32:35.019 --> 32:37.544
Actually, I never really met Ralph's kid.

32:37.989 --> 32:40.389
I saw him once from a distance, though.

32:40.692 --> 32:41.886
Handsome boy.

32:43.428 --> 32:46.864
He's got a long struggle ahead of him,
that's for sure.

32:47.265 --> 32:48.789
Doctors, rehab...

32:49.467 --> 32:51.094
physical therapy...

32:53.738 --> 32:56.901
I think I'm going to have
the medallions of veal.

33:11.089 --> 33:13.853
You make me late for a table
at Tavern on the fucking Green?

33:13.925 --> 33:15.825
How's the real estate business?

33:15.893 --> 33:17.690
- Excuse me?
- You know, HUD.

33:17.962 --> 33:21.090
Garside Street, you, Ralph, Zellman.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.198
Zellman tell you this?

33:25.503 --> 33:28.404
Carmine doesn't know anything
about this yet.

33:28.639 --> 33:31.699
I'm giving you an opportunity to cut a deal,
make it right.

33:31.776 --> 33:35.644
Last time, Frelinghuysen Avenue, I cut you
in out of friendship, but that's over.

33:35.713 --> 33:38.375
You got nothing coming to you.
You or Carmine.

33:39.784 --> 33:42.150
You sure you want to go down this road?

34:01.105 --> 34:04.506
How much to paint a different suit on him,
change his face a little?

34:04.575 --> 34:06.805
- Pardon me?
- Why throw it away?

34:07.545 --> 34:09.137
A stronger chin, maybe.

34:09.414 --> 34:12.110
I was thinking like those paintings
in the courthouse.

34:12.183 --> 34:15.983
Something classy, you know,
like a Revolutionary War general.

34:16.353 --> 34:18.844
Napoleon and his horse. That kind of thing.

34:19.424 --> 34:21.858
He's rather portly to be Napoleon.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.956
Not Napoleon, exactly.

34:24.795 --> 34:26.058
Like Napoleon.

34:29.534 --> 34:31.024
Sit down. Relax.

34:36.107 --> 34:37.835
What's going on, Ton'?

34:39.577 --> 34:42.808
I think I know what happened to Ralph,
and if I'm right...

34:43.081 --> 34:44.605
he ain't coming back.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.313
- It was New York.
- Johnny Sack?

34:51.755 --> 34:53.656
What was it? The fat joke?

34:54.092 --> 34:55.821
I'm sure that didn't help.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.318
Carmine.

34:58.596 --> 35:01.224
This HUD thing we're into,
they wanted a piece of it.

35:01.299 --> 35:03.324
I think they confronted Ralph...

35:03.968 --> 35:06.334
- things went sour.
- What'd he say, John?

35:06.504 --> 35:09.098
Wasn't what he said so much
as what he didn't say.

35:09.173 --> 35:11.004
We're talking about New York here.

35:11.075 --> 35:13.976
Before we do anything
in terms of a payback...

35:14.812 --> 35:16.336
you go to your people.

35:16.481 --> 35:18.346
I want a full investigation.

35:19.117 --> 35:22.109
Nobody makes a move
until we know what happened.

35:22.487 --> 35:23.784
You understand?

35:28.493 --> 35:29.755
What the fuck?

35:33.397 --> 35:35.331
- What's going on?
- Have a seat.

35:37.768 --> 35:40.168
I'm Dominic.
I know you don't know me, but...

35:40.404 --> 35:43.396
You're the guy who broke into
Stew Leonard's that time.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.408
You stole all those pork loins.

35:46.277 --> 35:49.007
Yeah, but that's not why I'm here today.

35:50.615 --> 35:53.607
- We're here to talk about your drug problem.
- What?

35:54.986 --> 35:58.353
- Jesus Christ, you fucking kidding me?
- Sorry, baby, please.

35:59.690 --> 36:01.157
No, fuck this shit.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.486
You were told once. Now, sit down.

36:05.229 --> 36:06.491
Sit down.

36:19.243 --> 36:21.609
Ma? Jesus.

36:28.486 --> 36:30.351
This won't be easy for any of us.

36:30.421 --> 36:34.289
But I want you to know that we're here today
because we care about you.

36:34.759 --> 36:38.251
- What was this, your idea?
- All we ask is that you listen.

36:41.332 --> 36:43.425
Adriana, you want to begin?

36:50.708 --> 36:52.869
"Christopher, I love you very much.

36:53.578 --> 36:56.547
"My only dream is that
we have a happy life together.

36:56.881 --> 37:00.009
"The last few months,
things have got very bad with us...

37:00.117 --> 37:02.517
"because of you using drugs all the time.

37:03.054 --> 37:06.717
- "You're high all the time and I can't take it. "
- Be specific, hon.

37:09.493 --> 37:13.054
"When we first started going out,
we made love all the time.

37:13.764 --> 37:17.291
- "Now, because of the drugs... "
- Jesus, is this fucking necessary?

37:17.368 --> 37:18.392
Go ahead.

37:19.337 --> 37:21.737
"... you can no longer function as a man.

37:23.474 --> 37:27.035
"Last week when I came home
to learn that you had killed our dog...

37:27.144 --> 37:28.941
"that was the final straw. "

37:31.015 --> 37:33.916
You killed the dog? What'd you do that for?

37:34.318 --> 37:36.411
- It was an accident.
- Was it barking?

37:36.487 --> 37:38.921
He sat on her while he was high.

37:39.257 --> 37:41.691
- Jesus Christ.
- I fell asleep.

37:42.226 --> 37:44.251
She got suffocated or something.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.130
Are you done, Adriana?

37:54.138 --> 37:55.605
You killed little Cosette?

37:55.673 --> 37:58.198
I ought to suffocate you, you little prick!

37:58.309 --> 38:00.106
Tony, we're going in order.

38:01.379 --> 38:03.404
"When I came in to open up one morning...

38:03.481 --> 38:08.077
"you had your head half in the toilet.
Your hair was in the toilet water.

38:08.386 --> 38:10.786
- "Disgusting. "
- I told you, I had the flu.

38:10.988 --> 38:13.923
- I said my piece.
- Great, I can't even defend myself, now?

38:13.991 --> 38:16.960
- No one's attacking you.
- It doesn't change anything.

38:18.029 --> 38:20.998
But I can verify that he was sick
for a little while.

38:21.499 --> 38:24.434
This thing with the dog.
How could you not see it on the chair?

38:24.502 --> 38:25.867
You're getting emotional.

38:25.936 --> 38:28.803
That's because I know what it's like
to lose a pet!

38:32.510 --> 38:35.968
I happen to know that you were high
at my mother-in-law's wake.

38:36.213 --> 38:40.479
You were talking non-stop for 20 minutes,
nothing but gibberish.

38:40.751 --> 38:42.378
My mother's wake.

38:43.054 --> 38:44.385
Jesus Christ.

38:50.895 --> 38:53.989
- You want to read your statement?
- I don't write nothing down.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.192
So I'll keep this short and sweet.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.461
You're weak. You're out of control.

38:58.636 --> 39:01.605
You've become an embarrassment
to yourself and everybody else.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.572
- Listen to you.
- Guys.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.405
We said "non-judgmental. "

39:06.711 --> 39:08.975
Fuck that. Let him take his medicine.

39:09.146 --> 39:11.706
Seriously, you want to talk
about fucking up?

39:11.849 --> 39:13.578
- Watch it, Chrissy.
- What?

39:13.784 --> 39:15.615
I thought we're being honest here.

39:16.787 --> 39:19.779
You got some balls, you know that.
All of you.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.423
You want to talk about self-control,
how about you, Sil?

39:24.662 --> 39:28.359
Fucking every slut working in the place
when you got a wife and kids.

39:30.234 --> 39:31.496
Or you, Paulie.

39:31.569 --> 39:34.367
Remember last winter in the woods
with the Russian guy?

39:34.438 --> 39:35.871
I am warning you!

39:35.940 --> 39:38.306
There he goes, Mr. Type A personality.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.106
We're talking about
you killing yourself with drugs!

39:41.178 --> 39:42.668
Not my fucking personality!

39:42.747 --> 39:44.681
- Right.
- I'm going to kill myself?

39:44.749 --> 39:47.582
The way you eat,
you'll have a heart attack before you're 50.

39:47.651 --> 39:49.812
- Sit down.
- You're talking to the boss.

39:49.887 --> 39:52.913
Good, maybe someone will smack
some goddamn sense into him!

39:52.990 --> 39:55.823
Great, my own mother.
Fuck you, you fucking whore!

39:56.694 --> 39:57.991
Son of a bitch!

40:00.631 --> 40:01.962
Guys, please!

40:02.032 --> 40:03.465
Come on!

40:04.101 --> 40:05.090
Stop it!

40:11.876 --> 40:13.901
Excuse me. How's he doing?

40:14.512 --> 40:16.036
I'm a relative.

40:16.113 --> 40:19.480
He slipped off the kitchen counter
spraying for ants?

40:19.617 --> 40:21.141
He was wearing socks.

40:21.986 --> 40:25.251
- Are you aware that he has a drug problem?
- Really?

40:26.524 --> 40:30.790
The man has a hairline skull fracture.
We'll admit him, keep him overnight.

40:31.762 --> 40:32.888
One minute.

40:36.634 --> 40:38.261
Give us a minute, okay?

40:49.914 --> 40:51.381
Does it hurt?

40:52.383 --> 40:54.476
They gave me some aspirin.

40:56.053 --> 40:59.181
Enjoy it, because it's the last fucking drug
you'll ever take.

41:01.892 --> 41:05.089
- I'm sorry, T.
- Shut the fuck up and listen to me.

41:06.664 --> 41:10.065
You're my nephew, Christopher,
and I love you.

41:11.969 --> 41:14.403
That's the only reason
you're alive right now.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.168
If it were anybody else, anybody...

41:17.541 --> 41:21.238
they would've had their intervention
through the back of their head.

41:21.912 --> 41:24.107
You and me, we're close.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.344
We've done a lot of things for each other.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.386
That cop shot my father.

41:31.121 --> 41:33.851
I know what you're telling me,
I'll never forget that.

41:33.924 --> 41:35.391
This is how you repay me.

41:35.459 --> 41:38.656
I gotta worry if you'll flip
over a nickel bag of white powder.

41:38.729 --> 41:41.095
- No, Tony, never.
- You lied to me.

41:41.298 --> 41:45.462
I told you, you were the future of this family.
I gave you that responsibility.

41:45.536 --> 41:48.596
And you looked me in the eye,
and you accepted it...

41:48.672 --> 41:50.731
and you were fucking high.

41:53.611 --> 41:54.873
Shut up.

41:56.247 --> 42:00.308
Tomorrow morning I gotta go with Patsy
up to this rehab place in Pennsylvania.

42:00.384 --> 42:02.375
You're going in. You're staying in.

42:02.453 --> 42:05.684
You'll go to every session,
and you'll keep your mouth shut.

42:05.756 --> 42:08.748
Now, if you need anything, anything at all...

42:10.160 --> 42:13.152
Patsy's going to be
half a mile away from you...

42:13.697 --> 42:15.062
in a motel.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.999
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

42:21.772 --> 42:24.297
- Do you understand?
- Tony, I'm sorry!

42:29.480 --> 42:31.710
How did I fucking get to this?

42:41.992 --> 42:44.825
- So he comes again.
- Brought some pastries.

42:45.329 --> 42:47.058
- Is he taking a nap?
- Yeah.

42:47.731 --> 42:50.894
- Is he driving you to drink?
- I can drive myself.

43:14.458 --> 43:15.948
I needed that.

43:16.694 --> 43:18.093
What's the matter?

43:18.228 --> 43:21.220
Spent a long time in the hospital last night.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.000
The shit that goes on down there.

43:28.138 --> 43:30.265
I wasn't expecting visitors.

43:44.521 --> 43:46.318
How about those Mets?

43:46.957 --> 43:49.118
Don't start with me and those Mets.

43:57.001 --> 43:59.128
You know, I was thinking about you.

44:00.604 --> 44:02.572
- So you're drunk already.
- No.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.437
I was thinking about the way you are.

44:04.508 --> 44:08.604
How you always have this little smile,
like you got your own private joke.

44:13.517 --> 44:15.348
You don't talk much, do you?

44:21.992 --> 44:23.516
I wish I knew your secret.

44:23.594 --> 44:26.791
Lose a leg and start making websites.

44:28.132 --> 44:32.466
That's the whole purpose for people
like me, to inspire people like you.

44:36.073 --> 44:39.770
- Jesus, no offense.
- That's the trouble with you Americans.

44:40.077 --> 44:42.807
You expect nothing bad ever to happen...

44:43.080 --> 44:46.345
when the rest of the world expects
only bad to happen.

44:46.417 --> 44:49.716
- They're not disappointed.
- That's a fucking grim outlook.

44:50.354 --> 44:53.255
You have everything, and still you complain.

44:53.724 --> 44:56.659
You lie on couches
and bitch to your psychiatrist.

44:57.995 --> 45:00.486
You got too much time
to think about yourselves.

45:00.564 --> 45:02.589
Sounds like me all right.

45:04.334 --> 45:05.767
You're not so bad.

45:06.637 --> 45:08.832
You have many fine qualities.

45:09.106 --> 45:11.734
You are big and strong...

45:12.543 --> 45:15.011
full of life, mischief.

45:15.679 --> 45:18.147
I have always feel positive towards you.

45:22.753 --> 45:24.584
You should see yourself now...

45:25.856 --> 45:29.121
in the shadows there,
with the smoke all around you.

45:31.095 --> 45:34.587
You're beautiful.
You remind me of that movie star...

45:36.166 --> 45:38.327
- Irina is beautiful.
- Greta Garbo.

46:39.129 --> 46:40.994
- May I help you?
- Yeah.

46:44.902 --> 46:47.837
<i>Brad to reception, your 1:00 client is here.</i>

46:51.842 --> 46:53.139
You'll call me later?

46:53.210 --> 46:56.111
No phone calls for the first two weeks.
House rules.

46:59.850 --> 47:01.078
I'll write.

47:01.618 --> 47:04.519
I was thinking of keeping a journal anyway.

47:04.922 --> 47:07.413
Get it published, maybe,
under my pen name.

47:12.029 --> 47:13.394
Congratulations.

47:15.332 --> 47:18.267
You got here, dude. That's the hardest part.

47:19.803 --> 47:22.067
I'm going to have to search your bag.

47:28.278 --> 47:31.076
- Cigarettes are okay, right?
- Cigarettes are fine.

47:31.148 --> 47:35.642
They're encouraged for patients who smoke.
But, Chris, no chocolate allowed.

47:35.819 --> 47:38.583
No caffeine
or substances containing caffeine.

47:42.159 --> 47:43.387
All set?

47:54.872 --> 47:57.033
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

48:18.395 --> 48:20.363
When's Bill coming back?

48:21.598 --> 48:22.929
Next week.

48:25.135 --> 48:27.603
I'll be busy for a few days...

48:28.972 --> 48:30.872
but I'll see you when I can.

48:31.675 --> 48:33.575
I think it's not a good idea.

48:34.177 --> 48:36.577
- What do you mean?
- Maybe I call you.

48:37.514 --> 48:39.038
But I don't think so.

48:39.149 --> 48:41.982
- You didn't like it?
- I like it very much.

48:42.619 --> 48:44.348
But, Tony, come on.

48:45.022 --> 48:47.923
You're a nice guy,
but I got my own problems.

48:47.991 --> 48:50.289
I don't want all the time prop you up.

48:52.329 --> 48:54.661
What, are you fucking kidding me?

49:00.904 --> 49:03.805
- What you doing?
- I didn't expect you so soon.

49:06.476 --> 49:08.410
Tell my uncle I'll talk to him later.

51:22.779 --> 51:26.306
<i>Lowe is not a 98-99 mile an hour guy.</i>

51:30.454 --> 51:34.117
<i>Driven out to deep left field!
Giving chase is Henderson, on the run!</i>

51:35.425 --> 51:37.586
<i>See ya! An opposite-field home run...</i>
