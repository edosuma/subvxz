BONNIE: Ric wants to bring Jo back to life

00:05.000 --> 00:06.650
with a stone
that's filled with evil incarnate.

00:06.840 --> 00:07.887
RIC: The Phoenix Stone.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.087
Bonnie, are you okay?

00:09.240 --> 00:11.811
BONNIE: There's something wrong
with that stone. We have to destroy it.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.207
My mother's a lunatic
and everyone's too scared to stop her.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.561
The deal has been made.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.683
We don't mess with them.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.804
And I'm the only one
who knows where she is.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.889
DAMON: She has Caroline. She has Elena.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.969
- This is her plan.
- Then we don't let her fracture us.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.207
Or we do.

DAMON: ...Four Heretics
at the funeral. Dead Malcolm makes five.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.409
But in 1903? There were six.

00:42.640 --> 00:43.846
Which means there's one more.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.122
I'm gonna find him. Negotiate a trade.

00:46.320 --> 00:48.084

No, and please don't ask me to.

I have no desire to get mixed up

You know, how long are you planning
on crashing here, Damon?

You know, you could compel yourself
a whole sorority house if you wanted to.

I'm starting to enjoy the luxury of having
one barely functional showerhead

by the four that I have in my actual home.

Relax. It's just till we hunt down
Lily's little lone-wolf Heretic

03:03.760 --> 03:05.762
and swap him out
for my girlfriend in a coma.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.530
Yeah, and, uh,
how long until that happens, huh?

03:19.280 --> 03:21.442
Oh, trust me, you're not. What's up?

03:21.680 --> 03:23.444
That Phoenix Stone
that I touched yesterday.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.889
You did destroy it
like you promised me, correct?

03:27.080 --> 03:28.844
- Why, what happened?
- I just had another vision.

10 minutes had gone by.

Stone's gone and I, you know,
watched it dissolve in hydrofluoric acid.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.721
- You're positive.
- Bonnie, the stone's gone.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.325

'cause Lily made a bunch of phone calls

03:48.920 --> 03:50.365

and something tells me she's not
making plans for her spring break.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.681
Why would Lily send one of her Heretics
to Myrtle Beach?

03:55.920 --> 03:59.322
Tell you what. You ask him yourself,
after he's safe in my car's trunk. Hmm?

was contained in an amulet.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.487
To be siphoned in times of need.

11:32.680 --> 11:35.524
I have a brother who's away at war.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.843
A father who judges me
for not joining him,

11:38.040 --> 11:41.362
and a mother who was strong and kind.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.444
She died when I was 10.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.405
I'm so sorry.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.691
Ah. It was a long time ago.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.004
There's no shame in missing her.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.968
A man on the outside
with the heart of a boy.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.643
There are worse things.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.449
Your chaperone is quite persistent.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.691
Then we shall elude him.

12:11.720 --> 12:13.563
- Come.
- What are you doing?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.086
(CHANTING SPELL)

12:22.520 --> 12:23.965
How did he not see us?

12:28.240 --> 12:29.480

12:30.400 --> 12:31.686

12:32.520 --> 12:34.090
None of your business.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.840
(CHUCKLES)

12:37.680 --> 12:39.967
I know why
you put that burning spell on me.

12:40.680 --> 12:43.604
It's not so Mary Louise and Nora
couldn't touch me.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.884
It's so Stefan wouldn't.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.205
Be more obvious.

12:48.400 --> 12:53.008
Well, since you're so curious,
please allow me to continue.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.930
Julian is going to kill me.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.884
Just compliment
the whiteness of his teeth.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.411
He'll forget all about it.

13:05.720 --> 13:06.960
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

13:26.000 --> 13:27.445

13:28.320 --> 13:29.560
No.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.086
No.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.929
It's just that I've never...

13:36.320 --> 13:38.322

(MUSIC PLAYING)

13:51.680 --> 13:52.920
(CHUCKUNG)

14:57.720 --> 15:00.041
It was his first time.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.004
I'm sure you've been someone's first.

15:02.200 --> 15:06.683
So you know what it's like to have
a completely unforgettable place

15:06.920 --> 15:08.331
in someone else's mind.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.211
Of course.

15:17.320 --> 15:18.651
(CHUCKLES)

15:19.880 --> 15:21.450
That's what I thought.

15:24.720 --> 15:28.327
Okay, so what's the plan?

15:28.520 --> 15:30.568
Okay, fair trade.
One Heretic in good condition,

15:30.760 --> 15:32.444
in return for the coffin housing Elena.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.211
No, I meant the plan
where we try to capture a powerful Heretic

15:35.400 --> 15:36.561
who'd prefer we were dead.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.444
Easy. B-Town stuns him with magic.

15:38.640 --> 15:41.883
You shoot him with vervain.
I snap his neck.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.361
Yeah. Right after we get him
to siphon away my visions.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.247
Wait, what?

15:46.400 --> 15:48.448
Well, the visions are magic.
He's a siphon.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.926
It's worth a shot, right?

15:50.960 --> 15:53.008
Any other suggestions
of how we can rid Bonnie

15:53.200 --> 15:55.282
of this mysterious pain she's in, Ric?

15:57.720 --> 15:58.960
Hmm.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.804
Room service. Free shrimp.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.281
Yeah, you folks have the wrong... Holy...

16:07.000 --> 16:08.650
(CHUCKLES) Damon Salvatore!

16:09.440 --> 16:11.329
- You know me?
- Of course, I know you.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.491
It's good to see you're well, old friend.
Come here, man.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.206
Hey. All right.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.371
(LAUGHS) Come in, come in. Come on.

16:27.600 --> 16:32.367
Uh, you caught me in the middle
of a 72-hour social gathering.

16:32.560 --> 16:33.686
(GRUNTS)

16:33.880 --> 16:35.120
Make yourself at home.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.130
Uh, friend with the vervain gun,

16:37.320 --> 16:40.529
if you could holster that
I sure would feel a lot more comfortable.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.007
- How do you know Damon?
- Well, he's Lily's son.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.245
The hero soldier. (LAUGHS)

16:49.840 --> 16:53.481
We... We met at a bar near Gettysburg.
July of 1863. Nothing?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.250
I go to a lot of bars.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.483
(CHUCKLES) Right, right, right.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.126
Uh, well, your mom was going through
a rough patch.

17:00.320 --> 17:03.369
She could not move on
until she knew her boys were okay,

17:03.560 --> 17:06.006
so she sent me out to find you.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.123
My mother abandoned her family
and ran for the hills.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.128
She didn't give a flying crap about me.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.209
I sense hostility and that's fine.

17:12.440 --> 17:15.444
All emotions are valid and welcome here.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.047
But it's the truth.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.884
She just wanted to know
you were happy, Damon.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.319
She loved you.

17:21.359 --> 17:23.249
Hey. you guys. What can I get you?

17:23.440 --> 17:26.090
Cocktail? Joint? Jenny?

17:26.319 --> 17:27.685
Does my mom know you're here?

17:27.880 --> 17:29.166
Hey, hey, hey. (SHUSHING)

17:30.400 --> 17:31.731
(LAUGHS) Shh.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.250
(RADIO PLAYING)

17:39.320 --> 17:41.800
No,no,no.
Keep the car on this side of the road.

17:42.600 --> 17:43.840
(SIGHS)

17:44.400 --> 17:46.050
Valerie never told me about your romance.

17:46.240 --> 17:48.322
Well, Valerie never told me
that you were alive.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.326
Would it have mattered?

17:51.960 --> 17:53.007
Is that a real question?

17:53.160 --> 17:54.764
She told me
that you'd forgotten all about me.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.765
She said you'd moved on and that,

17:57.080 --> 17:59.048
that was the only way
I was able to move on as well.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.811
My mother was practically
ripped out of my arms

18:02.000 --> 18:03.650
and sent to a TB ward.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.291
You don't move on from that.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.924
You find distractions.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.250
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

18:21.000 --> 18:23.162
Come with me, I wanna show you something.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.006
(CHUCKLES)

18:30.520 --> 18:32.284
VALERIE: This is romantic.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.084
This is my mother's grave.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.964
I come here every day
to replace the flowers.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.765
She's been dead for six years,

18:46.960 --> 18:50.123
but I'm still trying to make up
for my failure.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.120
What do you mean by that?

18:53.960 --> 18:55.246
She had consumption.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.801
One day, her coughing would not stop.

18:58.000 --> 19:02.801
My father sent me to go buy some flowers
to make an herbal tonic.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.764
I ran to town as fast as I could,

19:04.960 --> 19:07.281
but by the time I got home
with the flowers,

19:08.480 --> 19:10.482
she'd been taken to the sanatorium.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.046
(STEFAN SIGHS)

19:12.240 --> 19:14.163
You never got to say goodbye.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.324
She died in the TB ward, shortly after.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.362
I always wonder what would've happened

19:26.600 --> 19:30.366
if I'd just been able
to run a little faster.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.965
The tonic would have helped her.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.011
She could have lived.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.127
Were these the kind of flowers
you were sent for?

19:41.080 --> 19:44.641
- Yes. Cream--
- Cream violets.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.047
The tonic would not have saved her.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.561
That's very kind of you
but you cannot be certain.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.046
But I am.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.203
I worked in a sanatorium,
caring for patients

19:57.400 --> 19:58.970
who were just like your mother.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.881
Cream violets
have no medicinal properties.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.443
It's an old wives' tale.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.847
Your father sent you on a fool's errand.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.166
You were only 10.

20:13.360 --> 20:16.603
He probably wanted you out of the house
to make it easier on himself.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.246
No matter what,
you could not have saved your mother.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.608
Her death is not your fault.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.089
JULIAN: Time to say goodbye.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.928
I expected you would visit here
sooner or later.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.884
Sir, if you would just let me explain.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.367
We are leaving for New York. Now.

20:46.560 --> 20:47.891
I did not mean to disobey you.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.844
It was not me who you disobeyed.

20:50.080 --> 20:52.526
Come with me now,
and we will speak no more of it.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.080
The carriage awaits.

20:57.600 --> 20:59.045
When will I see you again?

20:59.240 --> 21:01.402
I will find my way back to you.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.925
I promise.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.246
So it's kind of like The Notebook

21:18.440 --> 21:22.445
except you two never reconnect
and he totally forgets about you.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.369
Julian was in a hurry to get to Europe.

21:25.560 --> 21:29.281
He convinced me to lie to Lily,
tell her that Stefan was happy.

21:29.480 --> 21:35.283
Believe me, Julian had a way
of convincing anyone to do anything.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.245
RIC: So why did Lily send you here?

21:39.480 --> 21:40.527
(CHUCKLES)

21:40.680 --> 21:42.921
She didn't send me here, exactly.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.929
She had a job and I volunteered.

21:45.120 --> 21:48.488
She has the family on a short leash,
back home, with this whole

21:48.680 --> 21:51.286
"I took you in as orphans,
so I know what's best for you" vibe.

21:51.480 --> 21:52.527
No, thank you.

21:52.680 --> 21:56.446
You know, you can get a drink served
to you here in a fishbowl here? (LAUGHS)

21:56.800 --> 22:02.250
Oh, hey, the other day I called
a number on this card

22:02.440 --> 22:04.522
and just like that, I had a girlfriend.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.000
It's called an escort service.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.522
But she really got who I am, you know?

22:09.760 --> 22:11.808
It was a beautiful human experience.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.401
And that's what I've discovered here.
Freedom.

22:14.640 --> 22:18.770
The bad trip inside that prison world
has ended, my friends,

22:18.960 --> 22:22.487
and I am breathing in
what my soul was craving.

22:22.680 --> 22:25.684
F-R-E-E-dom.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.884
Well, in the spirit of helping others
with their freedom,

22:29.080 --> 22:30.525
I have a favor to ask you.

22:30.720 --> 22:33.246
You know, as a siphoner.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.530
- Huh?
- Let me translate for you.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.131
My friends were playing
with some mystical tools

22:37.320 --> 22:38.367
they didn't quite understand

22:38.560 --> 22:41.166
and now Bonnie's chasing
her own white rabbit around the farm.

22:41.360 --> 22:46.082
So you want me to, what,
siphon her problems away?

22:46.400 --> 22:48.767
Just think of it as one big magical toke.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.280
(LAUGHS)

22:51.440 --> 22:53.841
I don't really like to mix mediums
if you know what I mean.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.485
Siphon the damn visions.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.882
We won't tell Lily
that we saw you avoiding

22:58.080 --> 23:01.084
whatever mission you were sent to do
and we'll call it a day.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.406
Okay then, come on.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.483
-(EXHALES) Ready? Okay.
- Yeah.

How do you know about the Phoenix Stone?

23:37.520 --> 23:38.760
How do you know about the Phoenix Stone?

- You lied to me.
- I didn't lie to you.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.049
Ric lied to you.
I just kept my mouth shut.

24:23.240 --> 24:25.208
Wait, I am not gonna be stuck
in the middle of this.

24:25.440 --> 24:27.283
No, no. You sort this out.

24:27.520 --> 24:29.488

they don't mean anything?
Doesn't matter to you?

Of course, they matter.
But bringing Jo back matters more.

Obviously, it was all a lie, right?

25:31.800 --> 25:32.847
What do you mean?

25:33.040 --> 25:34.610
Well, Valerie was using me.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.048
No. No, Valerie wouldn't have hurt you,

25:37.240 --> 25:39.766
because that would have
inadvertently hurt me as well.

25:39.960 --> 25:41.007
Hmm. Did it ever occur to you

25:41.200 --> 25:46.331
that maybe Valerie doesn't give a crap
about you or anyone else.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.766
I don't believe that.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.200
No?

25:50.120 --> 25:52.361
How about the part
where she sent me a telegram

25:52.560 --> 25:54.289
saying she was coming back?

25:54.480 --> 25:55.811
She what?

25:58.240 --> 25:59.890
STEFAN: She had been gone a few months.

26:00.720 --> 26:03.246
VALERIE: "I promised
I would find my way back to you.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.086
"I long to be in your arms again."

26:08.800 --> 26:11.167
STEFAN:
She said she wanted to run away with me.

26:11.360 --> 26:14.603
Her telegram said to meet her Friday
at noon.

26:14.920 --> 26:17.241
(CHUCKLES) I showed up two hours early.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.087
VALERIE: He waited and waited for me.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.763
With every passing footstep,
he would turn,

26:23.960 --> 26:25.450
expecting to see me.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.442
STEFAN: Sat around all day, like an idiot.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.484
Past sundown. After nightfall.

26:33.600 --> 26:34.840
But she never showed up.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.290
So yeah, I guess you could say

26:37.480 --> 26:40.370
I'm wondering
what the hell the whole point was.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.770
Surely you're not still angry with her?

26:49.640 --> 26:51.483
It was 150 years ago.

26:52.600 --> 26:57.128
VALERIE: Eventually he accepted
that he'd been "abandoned all over again."

26:58.040 --> 26:59.769
And then he "walked home,

27:01.640 --> 27:04.325
"under the cold and distant stars."

27:10.960 --> 27:12.769
How could you do that to him?

27:18.240 --> 27:20.004
There was a change of plan.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.090
I'm done talking to you about this.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.886
On the very day
our ship leaves for England?

27:50.080 --> 27:51.491
Let me pass. I'm not going.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.603
Yes. You are.

27:54.720 --> 27:58.008
Because Lily will not travel anywhere
without her precious little orphans

27:58.200 --> 28:00.089
and it is imperative that I leave today.

28:05.320 --> 28:07.402
- Do I frighten you?
- No.

28:07.840 --> 28:10.241
Hmm. Because I can hear
your heart beating faster.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.242
Both your hearts, in fact.

28:15.200 --> 28:18.090
Does Stefan Salvatore know
that you're pregnant with his child?

28:30.160 --> 28:31.400
DAMON: I lied.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.806
I do remember you.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.206
I was fighting for the South.

28:35.440 --> 28:38.171
It's not exactly a time I like
to reminisce about in front of my friends.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.368
Yeah, you had the same opinion back then.

28:40.560 --> 28:42.244
Hated everything your side believed in.

28:42.440 --> 28:45.649
Hey, you wanted to desert,
but feared shaming your old man.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.330
You compelled me to take sick leave.

28:47.520 --> 28:50.251
The next day, my entire regiment
was slaughtered in Gettysburg.

28:51.840 --> 28:52.887
You saved my life.

28:53.080 --> 28:54.320
I couldn't compel you back then.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.046
All I did was talk to you.

28:56.440 --> 28:59.250
From one human to another.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.050
I told you to follow your heart.

Now it's my turn to desert.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.410
I don't wanna be a part
of Lily's cavalry, okay.

I don't want rules or a chain of command.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.004
I just wanna have fun. (LAUGHS)

29:12.440 --> 29:14.727
You know what,
a little extra piece of advice?

29:14.960 --> 29:16.962
A lot of people want the Phoenix Stone.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.523
Mess with it, you end up dead.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.210
Full disclosure.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.524
I don't care about the stone.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.926
Then why are you chasing me, man?

29:25.120 --> 29:28.442

30:32.200 --> 30:33.247
Is Valerie here?

30:33.440 --> 30:37.923
I heard her leave the house.
I guess torture makes her hungry.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.247
Forgive me for prying,

30:43.480 --> 30:45.448
but I heard your mother died
this past spring.

30:46.720 --> 30:50.088
I just spent the day
reliving Stefan's first time.

30:50.320 --> 30:52.322
I really don't feel like talking
about my dead mother

30:52.520 --> 30:54.204
with my hostage-taker.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.640
But thanks.

30:55.840 --> 31:00.209
I was simply curious about
one's ability to heal after such a loss.

31:03.400 --> 31:04.845
Well, you must've had a mother.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.287
I mean, even Mussolini had a mother.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.127
Of course, I had a mother.

31:09.320 --> 31:13.723
Then you know that love is different
than any other kind of love.

31:14.360 --> 31:16.761
Hey, Stefan wrote about you all the time.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.844
You can read for yourself.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.366
He missed you.

Uh, is this one of those mean-girl tricks?

31:51.240 --> 31:54.449
No. It's a reward for Stefan's honesty.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.810
Go, before I change my mind.

32:04.840 --> 32:09.528

I can see that
sometimes you still do as well.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.410
It's a comfort.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.724
It's strange to be here with you.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.242
Finally able to tell you the truth.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.251
Please don't tell Lily.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.086
Well, you have your reasons
for staying here

33:04.240 --> 33:06.607

by beating me senseless.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.444
Till I was left near dead.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.001
And the other heartbeat inside me stopped.

33:36.920 --> 33:40.766
When I regained consciousness,
I was on the ship to England.

33:42.520 --> 33:46.161
Lily said Julian had found me
robbed and beaten on the street.

33:47.760 --> 33:51.970
She believed him, of course,
and she healed me with her blood.

33:53.440 --> 33:56.284
Julian knew I could never tell Lily
what he had done,

33:56.440 --> 33:58.681

also have exposed my lies-</i>

33:59.120 --> 34:00.849

for having an affair with her son.

I didn't want to live
under Julian's thumb.

I drew myself a bath.

that book already. Cover to cover.
