about it. People just go off the wall.

we're on the job.

little easier knowing we're out there...

01:47.974 --> 01:50.966

walking the streets at night,

01:51.044 --> 01:53.979
well, that's a good feeling.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.650
Okay.

01:58.718 --> 02:02.484

in this district.

08:32.809 --> 08:35.142

of a monster
prowling the neighborhood.

We've been to this house before.
The lady has a history of medication.

- Yeah, maybe. But she's not
the only one seeing monsters.

in this area in the past 60 days.

08:51.196 --> 08:53.960
- No.
- Yeah.

08:54.032 --> 08:56.330
Also, these sightings only occur
on nights when there's a full moon,

08:56.401 --> 08:59.734
- which tells me something.
- [Paula] What?

08:59.804 --> 09:02.967
What you saw was large, right?
Maybe seven, eight feet tall...

09:03.041 --> 09:06.408
when it stood up on its two legs,
and it was covered in fur...

09:06.477 --> 09:09.071
and had glowing red eyes
and claws...

09:09.147 --> 09:11.911
claws sharp enough to gouge
the wood off that front door.

09:11.983 --> 09:16.249
- You're not serious?
- And dare I forget teeth?

09:16.321 --> 09:19.813

Yeah, look at that.

09:19.891 --> 09:22.382
Deputy, how long were you gonna
hide that from the E.M.T. S?

09:22.460 --> 09:24.394
- I don't...
- Where'd you get that, Keith?

09:24.462 --> 09:27.090
I don't even know
where that came from.

09:27.165 --> 09:29.759
I mean, I didn't see anything
that he's talking about.

09:30.835 --> 09:33.303
Big teeth,
eight feet tall.

09:33.371 --> 09:35.669
- What the hell are you describing?
- A werewolf.

09:35.740 --> 09:39.198
- Excuse me?
- It's what did that.

09:39.277 --> 09:42.974
It also attacked one Hymen Escallera
29 days ago during the last full moon.

09:43.047 --> 09:45.140
Hymen died of his wounds
in Compton General Hospital,

09:45.216 --> 09:48.185
but not before giving a detailed
description of what attacked him.

09:48.253 --> 09:51.154
My partner and I
are here to catch it.

09:51.222 --> 09:53.884
Unfortunately, though, Deputy,
you've been bitten.

09:53.958 --> 09:56.290
The skin is broken.

09:56.361 --> 09:58.295
Werewolf law pretty much
universally holds that...

09:58.363 --> 10:01.855
someone who's been bitten
by such a creature is gonna
become such a creature himself.

10:01.933 --> 10:04.800
- So...
- Wait a minute. I mean...

10:04.869 --> 10:06.803

what happened, though.

be isolated and kept under guard.

- Agent Mulder?

10:20.985 --> 10:23.215

a second?

10:23.288 --> 10:26.917
Excuse me.
What is it?

10:26.991 --> 10:30.620
What is it? Mulder, have you noticed
that we're on television?

10:30.695 --> 10:33.664
I don't think it's live television,
Scully. She just said [Bleep]

10:33.731 --> 10:36.199
But it's a camera,
and it's recording.

10:36.267 --> 10:38.963
It's recording everything that you
are saying. Do you understand that?

10:39.037 --> 10:41.005
I just wanna make sure
that you're clear on that.

10:41.072 --> 10:43.006
Sure, I'm clear on that,
Scully.

10:43.074 --> 10:45.941
My point being, Mulder,
that we are on a case.

10:46.010 --> 10:49.002
Well, this presents an opportunity.
I feel we're very close here.

10:49.080 --> 10:52.311
And the possibility of capturing
concrete proof of the paranormal...

10:52.383 --> 10:55.546
of a werewolf in front
of a national audience,
even an international audience...

10:55.620 --> 10:58.589
- What's not to love?
- Well...

10:58.656 --> 11:02.820
Look, Mulder, you wanna talk
about werewolves to me,
you can knock yourself out.

11:02.894 --> 11:05.419
I may not agree with you, but at least
I'm not gonna hold it against you.

11:05.496 --> 11:08.932
But this... Mulder,
this could ruin your career.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.059
[Chuckles]
What career?

11:11.135 --> 11:13.535
Scully, I appreciate it.
You don't want me looking foolish.

11:13.604 --> 11:16.095
I do.
I appreciate that.

11:16.174 --> 11:18.574
I don't want me
looking foolish, Mulder.

11:20.812 --> 11:22.746
Okay, fine.
Well, do me a favor.

11:22.814 --> 11:24.748
Will you just escort
Deputy Wetzel to the hospital?

11:24.816 --> 11:27.512
Just keep an eye on him
in case I'm right? Thank you.

11:29.987 --> 11:32.012
- I'm gonna call Skinner, Mulder.
- Okay.

11:32.090 --> 11:34.854
I'm sure he's gonna wanna say
a couple words about this.

11:37.628 --> 11:39.562

huh?

into the house and get her.

12:06.756 --> 12:10.385
Uh, it was big and had claws
pretty much. Keeps going on and on.

12:10.460 --> 12:12.951
Yeah, all right. Tell her to describe it
in detail to the sketch artist.

12:13.029 --> 12:14.963
- Will you work with her? Yeah.
- Claw monster?

12:15.031 --> 12:17.761
- Just do it, Ricky.
- Okay.

12:17.834 --> 12:21.326
Hey, look at that.
Excuse me.

12:21.404 --> 12:24.862
Look at this.
It's like five claw marks.

12:24.941 --> 12:28.775
Just like the human hand
has five fingers. Pretty much
the same spread too.

12:28.845 --> 12:31.006
- Agent, you seriously believe...
- Huh?

12:31.080 --> 12:33.014

some kind of a...

12:33.082 --> 12:35.141
I'll show you.

12:35.218 --> 12:37.379
This.

12:37.453 --> 12:39.648

and he just
keeps coming back.

dark out, and I'm parked up the street.

Yeah, come on, Ricky.
I'll walk you to your car.

- Yeah, you can return the vest later.

13:20.563 --> 13:23.555
- This is what she was tellin'...
- That's what she's saying.
That's the claw monster.

13:25.001 --> 13:27.196
You catch?
[Sobbing]

13:28.471 --> 13:30.939
- Catch-Catch him?
- Si. Si.

13:31.007 --> 13:32.941
You catch.

13:48.724 --> 13:52.125
[Mulder]
How's Deputy Wetzel?

13:52.195 --> 13:55.187
- You let him get released?
- Well,

13:55.264 --> 13:57.664
those weren't
teeth marks, Mulder.

13:57.733 --> 13:59.997
They turned out
to be insect bites.

14:00.069 --> 14:03.129
Individual welts
or stings of some sort.

14:04.407 --> 14:07.137
Together, they just look like
a larger pattern,

14:07.210 --> 14:09.371
especially when
we want them to.

14:11.347 --> 14:14.077
Although, it was
an understandable conclusion...

14:14.150 --> 14:16.141
that I'm sure
anybody would have made.

14:18.221 --> 14:21.315
So what did
Skinner say?

14:21.390 --> 14:24.882
He said that the F.B.I.
Has nothing to hide,

14:24.961 --> 14:26.895
and neither do we.

14:26.963 --> 14:28.988
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm not entirely convinced...

14:29.065 --> 14:31.226
that we're looking for
a werewolf anymore.

14:31.300 --> 14:35.066
- Oh. All right. Good.
- Yeah, it's something else.

14:35.137 --> 14:37.970
I'm not sure what.
Some other kind of creature though.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.974
- I have a... Hey, what's going on?
- [Police Radio Chattering]

14:40.042 --> 14:42.340
Six blocks from here.
Could be what we're looking for.

14:45.681 --> 14:47.808
No. You go
with someone else.

14:47.884 --> 14:51.047
[Man Over Police Radio]
Man down at the corner of...

14:51.120 --> 14:53.111
[Continues, Indistinct]

15:07.003 --> 15:08.937
Guys, watch out.
I'm a doctor.

15:11.607 --> 15:13.541
Oh, man, it's Ricky.

15:22.184 --> 15:24.118
[Mulder]
That's what I was afraid of, Scully.

15:30.425 --> 15:33.690
[Wetzel] When a fellow offcer
goes down in the line of duty,

15:33.761 --> 15:36.025
or even if it's...
even if it's not a fellow offcer...

15:36.097 --> 15:38.657
if it's just somebody working
part-time with the department...

15:38.733 --> 15:41.964
in a support, uh...

15:42.036 --> 15:45.267
artistic capacity...

15:45.339 --> 15:48.536
like Ricky there...
we all feel it.

15:48.609 --> 15:52.443
Uh, that there is
every cop's worst nightmare.

15:52.513 --> 15:56.108
But that's when you gotta
cowboy up and give 150 percent...

15:56.184 --> 15:58.118
and catch the bad guys.

15:59.887 --> 16:01.946
[Scully] Last call from his phone
was made to the Road Club.

16:02.023 --> 16:06.153
Ricky called in requesting roadside
assistance for his flat tire.

16:06.227 --> 16:08.491
He asked them to hurry.
He said he didn't feel safe.

16:10.364 --> 16:13.595
- What's that?
- Our suspect, apparently.

16:13.668 --> 16:16.831
- [Scoffs]
- The slash marks match up pretty well,

16:16.904 --> 16:18.838
wouldn't you say?

16:25.947 --> 16:27.881
Somebody lost a nail.

16:30.017 --> 16:32.713
Nice color.

16:32.787 --> 16:35.278
Check out this color,
Mulder.

16:35.356 --> 16:37.290
Blood red.

16:38.893 --> 16:41.521
Hey, uh, who called 911
on this?

16:41.596 --> 16:44.429
- [Knocking On Door]
- [Paula] Steve and Edy?
Sergeant Paula.

16:44.499 --> 16:47.764
The Steve and Edy?

16:47.835 --> 16:50.770
They're good folk. They usually call us
if there's trouble in the neighborhood.

16:53.274 --> 16:56.209
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God! Look at this!

16:56.277 --> 16:58.745
- Look at all these people. Lord!
- How are you doin' this evening?

16:58.813 --> 17:01.907
- We fine.
- Can y'all tell us
what happened out here?

17:01.983 --> 17:03.848
Not with me lookin'
like this. Mm-mmm.

17:03.918 --> 17:06.215
Now, you should know
better than that, Sergeant Paula!

17:06.287 --> 17:09.882
Like she gonna run from a camera.
Look it here.

17:09.957 --> 17:14.121
We heard all this screamin',
peeked out the window,

17:14.194 --> 17:18.393
and this boy with crazy hair
was having a conniption fit...

17:18.465 --> 17:20.525
all rolled up there
by the phone.

17:20.601 --> 17:23.229
You didn't see his...
his attacker?

17:23.304 --> 17:25.795
- Mmm.
- I'm ready for my close-up.

17:25.873 --> 17:28.204
Ain't nobody care about your scabby ass.
This is police business.

17:28.276 --> 17:31.268
- What?
- Now, I didn't see...

17:31.345 --> 17:33.438
- What'd you say? Attacker?
- Attacker.

17:33.514 --> 17:37.678
- No, he was just kind of
all rolled up and yellin'.
- Mm-hmm.

17:37.752 --> 17:40.277
Did you see anything...

17:40.354 --> 17:42.288
that looked like this?

17:42.356 --> 17:45.120
- Ooh, stop!
- Or this?

17:45.193 --> 17:48.629
- Ooh! Excuse me?
- That's gonna give me nightmares.

17:48.696 --> 17:51.563
- So you didn't see anything at all?
- Uh-uh. No.

17:51.632 --> 17:53.793
Did you, uh...
Did you see a woman?

17:53.868 --> 17:56.769
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

17:56.838 --> 17:59.864
- Chantara. I know that
skanky-ass color anywhere.
- Mm-hmm.

17:59.941 --> 18:02.136
- Sure do.
- Chantara a streetwalker?

18:02.210 --> 18:04.576
- Mm-hmm. She work the corner.
- Mm-hmm.

18:04.645 --> 18:06.636
- She on the pipe, so we don't associate.
- Oh, yeah.

18:06.714 --> 18:08.648
- Mm-mmm. No.
- You know what I'm sayin'?

18:08.716 --> 18:11.947
Well, we should go...
We should go talk to Chantara then.

18:12.019 --> 18:14.249
- Well, I wish you would. Mm-hmm.
- That's right.

18:14.322 --> 18:17.689
Hey! Hey!
When I'm a-get my own TV show?

18:17.758 --> 18:20.886
- # If I didn't care #
- Oh, she's showin' off now.

18:20.962 --> 18:23.453
- # More than words can say #
- Stop! Stop! Get in there! Stop this!

18:23.531 --> 18:25.590
- Would you excuse us? Excuse us.
- # If I didn't care ##

18:25.666 --> 18:29.193
Get in there! Stop this!
Bye, y'all. Bye.

18:29.270 --> 18:31.329
So apparently,
we're on the lookout...

18:31.405 --> 18:34.499
for someone whose hair
matches her fingernails.

18:34.575 --> 18:38.636
Bubblegum pink. That would be
a good color for you, Scully.

18:42.850 --> 18:45.944
I'd have to say that at this point
in the investigation,

18:46.020 --> 18:48.454
I'm-I'm usually
a little more secure...

18:48.522 --> 18:50.956
in-in what it is
we're actually investigating.

18:51.025 --> 18:54.188
But we've had so many conflicting
eyewitness reports...

18:54.262 --> 18:58.164
that it's hard to ascertain exactly
what it is we're looking for.

19:02.837 --> 19:07.171
But the crimes we are investigating
are... are paranormal.

19:07.241 --> 19:09.937
I can say that...

19:10.011 --> 19:12.912
with absolute conviction.

19:12.980 --> 19:16.279
And the nature of these crimes,
they're-they're notoriously
hard to quantify...

19:16.350 --> 19:20.650
in any kind of rigorous scientific
level, as Agent Scully will tell you.

19:20.721 --> 19:24.521
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, which in its own way...

19:24.592 --> 19:29.188
is a kind of a validation, if
you think about it, in and of itself.

19:29.263 --> 19:33.165
But, you know, that's our job.
That's why they pay us the big bucks.

19:35.102 --> 19:37.036
Bubblegum pink.

19:40.408 --> 19:44.105
- Don't run! F.B.I.!
- Chantara Gomez?

19:44.178 --> 19:46.612
- Chantara...
- Chantara Gomez?

19:46.681 --> 19:48.876
[Chuckles]

19:48.950 --> 19:52.852
- Don't run! It's okay.
- [Car Doors Opening, Closing]

19:54.455 --> 19:57.151
- It's okay.
- [Panting, Sobbing]

19:57.224 --> 20:00.819
- It's all right.
- Chantara Gomez?

20:00.895 --> 20:03.420
- Can I see your hands, please?
- I didn't do nothing!

20:03.497 --> 20:06.091
- Can I see your hands, please?
It's okay.
- [Sobbing]

20:06.167 --> 20:08.533
- We need to see your hands.
- Show her your hands.

20:14.742 --> 20:18.542
Earlier this evening, a man
was attacked. He was badly slashed.

20:18.612 --> 20:21.513
And do you realize that
this places you at the crime scene?

20:21.582 --> 20:24.312
Fisher and Delmont. That's
your usual hang, isn't it, Chantara?

20:24.385 --> 20:27.877
Look, I heard screaming, okay?
And I went and I tried to help this guy.

20:27.955 --> 20:31.083
And when I heard the sirens, I just
ran away, okay? I didn't do nothing!

20:31.158 --> 20:33.183
Look, I believe you.
I think you saw something.

20:33.260 --> 20:36.627
You witnessed something.
Tell me what it is.

20:36.697 --> 20:38.961
- I can't.
- You can tell us, Chantara.

20:41.936 --> 20:44.598
- Come on. It's okay.
- Chantara.

20:44.672 --> 20:49.507
If you're afraid that what you tell us,
we're not gonna believe it, don't be.

20:49.577 --> 20:52.171
So whatever it is
you saw tonight,

20:52.246 --> 20:54.476
whatever it is,
whatever you think you saw,

20:54.548 --> 20:58.416
however strange
or terrifying or bizarre,

20:58.486 --> 21:00.477
you are not gonna
surprise me.

21:00.554 --> 21:02.488
Okay?

21:03.924 --> 21:06.392
You'll protect me
from Chuko?

21:06.460 --> 21:09.623
- Who's Chuko?
- Mi novio.

21:09.697 --> 21:12.723
He's the one who cut that guy up,
not me! I didn't do anything!

21:12.800 --> 21:15.166
- I'm sorry. What?
- Mi novio. Her boyfriend.

21:15.236 --> 21:17.170
No, I got that.

21:18.773 --> 21:21.139
Look, he's been chasing me
for a week, okay?

21:21.208 --> 21:25.372
He said he was gonna twist my
neck off like a little chicken
if I didn't give him more money.

21:25.446 --> 21:27.914
- Chuko.
- Chuko Munos.

21:27.982 --> 21:30.081
The cops know who he is.

21:36.487 --> 21:38.921
This is my favorite part of the job...
knockin' down crack houses.

21:38.989 --> 21:40.752
I heard that.

21:40.825 --> 21:42.918
I don't understand.
I told you everything you need to know!

21:42.993 --> 21:45.461
- Chantara, first of all,
- I just wanna go home now!

21:45.529 --> 21:48.089
You are not out of the woods yet
as far as possible
accessory charges, all right?

21:48.165 --> 21:51.532
- Chuko's the one you want!
- So the sooner we find him,
the sooner we can let you go.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.661
He's gonna kill me! You don't
understand! He's gonna kill me!

21:53.737 --> 21:55.762
He told me he was gonna
twist my neck off like a chicken!

21:55.840 --> 21:57.705
Chantara, no one's
gonna kill you.

21:57.775 --> 22:00.437
- He's gonna kill me!
- Chantara, look around...
look around you!

22:00.511 --> 22:04.345
You see all the deputies here?
You see? No one is going to get you.

22:04.415 --> 22:06.713
- [Sobbing]
- Now, what's more, Deputy Wetzel here...

22:06.784 --> 22:09.344
is going to keep an eye on you
while we go and put the cuffs on Chuko.

22:09.420 --> 22:11.684
No one is going
to get you.

22:11.755 --> 22:14.189
[Police Radio Chattering]

22:20.197 --> 22:23.325
Chuko Munos.
The man himself.

22:23.400 --> 22:26.892
Only distinguishing feature
is a tattoo on his skull.

22:26.971 --> 22:29.701
- He's not our guy.
- What do you mean?

22:29.773 --> 22:32.833
I don't care how bad his rep is,
he can't turn over a squad car.

22:32.910 --> 22:36.073
Maybe not by himself,
but he's probably got friends, right?

22:36.147 --> 22:38.445
There's something else
going on.

22:39.850 --> 22:43.013
Let's hit it.

22:43.087 --> 22:45.612
[Man Over Radio] Units on a warrant.
Let's hold all radio traffc.

23:00.404 --> 23:02.338
[Banging]

23:04.909 --> 23:07.707
[Yelling, Shouting]

23:07.778 --> 23:10.008
[Paula]
Go, go, go!

23:10.080 --> 23:12.605
Hands above your head!
Get your hands above your head!

23:12.683 --> 23:14.742
[Shouting Continues]

23:14.818 --> 23:17.548
- Clear above your head!
- Let's see your hands!

23:21.692 --> 23:24.388
- Have you seen Chuko Munos?
- [Bleep] you, mother... [Bleep]

23:24.461 --> 23:26.395
[Spits, Yells]

23:26.463 --> 23:28.397
[Yelling, Shouting]

23:30.968 --> 23:33.129
Put your hands on the wall!
On the wall!

23:33.204 --> 23:35.695
- [Crying]
- [Shouting Continues]

23:37.875 --> 23:39.843
Get your [Bleep] hands off me.

23:41.779 --> 23:43.770
Oh, man.

23:43.847 --> 23:46.577
[Paula]
Agents! Agents, in here.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.090
Hey, what happened?
Wake up.

23:59.163 --> 24:01.927
- What happened to your friend in there?
- Check the tattoo.

24:05.436 --> 24:08.735
- Looks like he O.D. 'd.
- Yeah, but how long ago?

24:08.806 --> 24:11.297
[Scully]
Couple days. Maybe a week.

24:11.375 --> 24:13.502
He didn't attack Ricky Kola,
that's for sure.

24:16.914 --> 24:20.145
- [Gunfre]
- Shots fired!

24:20.217 --> 24:23.209
- [Yelling, Shouting]
- [Gunfre Continues]

24:29.760 --> 24:32.024
- It's here!
- What?

24:32.096 --> 24:35.554
- It's gettin'away!
- What you got? What you shooting at?

24:35.633 --> 24:39.034
What are you shooting at?
Keith, what are you doin'?

24:39.103 --> 24:41.867
It came back.
It was here.

24:41.939 --> 24:44.237
- [Panting] It-It was here.
- Keith!

24:46.110 --> 24:49.511
Oh, man. I heard her screamin',
and I tried to...

24:49.580 --> 24:51.514
I tried to stop it.
I swear to you, I tried.

24:51.582 --> 24:54.210
- I did everything I could do.
- Oh, sh...

24:54.285 --> 24:56.981
I did everything I could do.

24:57.054 --> 24:59.045
[Scully]
What is it, Mulder?

25:03.294 --> 25:05.922
What...
[Sighs]

25:10.868 --> 25:14.065
- [Paula] Call it in.
- [Male Offcer] 212-40,
I have a possible 9-27.

25:19.408 --> 25:21.933
[Paula] I wish someone would explain
to me what the hell is going on here.

25:22.011 --> 25:24.036
It just doesn't make sense.

25:24.113 --> 25:28.675
Keith Wetzel may be a little green,
but he is a solid deputy.

25:28.751 --> 25:31.447
Nothing could've gotten past him
and killed that woman.

25:31.520 --> 25:34.683
There's no sign of what he was
shooting at. This is all we found.

25:34.757 --> 25:36.748
Nine millimeter.
It's our issue.

25:36.826 --> 25:39.056
- Where did you find that?
- It was lying in
the middle of the street.

25:39.128 --> 25:41.926
Doesn't look like
a ricochet.

25:41.998 --> 25:45.456
Maybe Wetzel hit what he was aiming at.
Excuse me.

25:52.274 --> 25:54.208
Hey, Deputy.

25:55.378 --> 25:57.312
You ready
to talk to me now?

26:02.084 --> 26:05.485
You and I both know you saw something.
We're way past claiming you didn't.

26:09.592 --> 26:11.526
I only know
what I thought I saw.

26:11.594 --> 26:13.528
Well, describe it
for me.

26:18.134 --> 26:21.228
[Sighs]
The Wasp Man.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.908
The Wasp Man?

26:26.976 --> 26:29.308
- It's ridicu... It's ridiculous.
- [Car Engine Starts]

26:29.378 --> 26:31.744
Scary stories my older brother
used to tell me when I was a kid...

26:31.814 --> 26:34.374
about a monster,
head like a wasp...

26:34.450 --> 26:36.714
and a mouth full of stingers
instead of teeth.

26:38.054 --> 26:40.318
He said that it would
come get me in my sleep,

26:40.389 --> 26:44.587
and that... and that it would
sting me to death.

26:44.660 --> 26:48.152
So you're saying that the Wasp Man
attacked you both times...

26:48.230 --> 26:50.960
- here and earlier in the patrol car?
- L...

26:51.033 --> 26:54.628
I'm not saying that
that's what it was, okay?

26:54.703 --> 26:58.298
I mean, they didn't see it.
It's not on the videotape.

27:01.377 --> 27:03.368
This-This can't be real.

27:03.446 --> 27:06.609
No, I think maybe it can.
Just relax a minute. Excuse me.

27:06.682 --> 27:10.812
Scully, we came on this case
lookin' for a werewolf, right?

27:10.886 --> 27:12.820
No, you did.
That's correct.

27:12.888 --> 27:15.118
Hymen Escallera claimed
he was attacked by a werewolf,

27:15.191 --> 27:19.491
and the wounds that he sustained
would seem to bear that out, right?

27:19.562 --> 27:22.224
And then, uh,
Wetzel over here sees a wasp man...

27:22.298 --> 27:24.266
with stingers for teeth,
and he gets a bite mark...

27:24.333 --> 27:26.858
that you say is irrefutably
insect-like, right?

27:26.936 --> 27:29.302
Mulder, that's not exactly...
[Sighs]

27:29.371 --> 27:31.464
[Mulder] And another eyewitness
claims she sees Freddy Krueger.

27:31.540 --> 27:34.998
Scully, what if... what if
we're dealing with one creature,

27:35.077 --> 27:39.309
one entity, that when it attacks appears
to you as your worst nightmare?

27:39.381 --> 27:43.112
Fear. Maybe that's what
this thing feeds on.

27:45.354 --> 27:48.323
- Okay, well, for the sake
of this argument,
- Yeah?

27:48.390 --> 27:50.858
How would one catch
something like that?

27:50.926 --> 27:53.190
[Chuckles]

27:53.262 --> 27:57.221
Probably by... by figuring out
how it chooses its prey.

27:57.299 --> 28:00.132
I mean, they're...
It seems to spread like a contagion.

28:00.202 --> 28:03.729
One person's fear becomes the next.
There's a definite chain of victims.

28:03.806 --> 28:06.832
Tonight it went from Mrs. Guerrero
to Wetzel and the sketch artist.

28:06.909 --> 28:11.107
And then from the sketch artist
to Chantara Gomez.

28:11.180 --> 28:13.307
- And then... Right.
- Chantara Gomez back to Wetzel.

28:13.382 --> 28:16.317
- But you're missing someone, Mulder.
- Who?

28:17.720 --> 28:20.712
Edy.
Steve and Edy.

28:20.789 --> 28:22.723
They're a part
of this chain too.

28:22.791 --> 28:25.282
And according to your theory,
they would've been attacked, right?

28:41.443 --> 28:44.037
So we're back at the home
of Steve and Edy.

28:44.113 --> 28:48.277
We should probably check on them because
they seem to fit a victim profile.

28:48.350 --> 28:51.410
I'm sorry.
Are you talking to me?

28:51.487 --> 28:53.421
[Steve, Edy Screaming]

28:55.791 --> 28:58.157
- [Steve] Shut up!
What's going on with you?
- Hey!

28:58.227 --> 29:01.094
[Screaming Continues]

29:01.163 --> 29:05.190
What the hell are...
What the hell is this?

29:05.267 --> 29:07.929
[Scully]
Steve, are you gonna be all right?

29:08.003 --> 29:10.972
- I'm all right.
- [Edy Sobbing]
Somebody ask if I'm all right.

29:11.040 --> 29:14.009
I'm the victim! I'm the victim here!
He don't treat me right.

29:14.076 --> 29:16.044
- All right.
- You better appreciate me, or I'll walk!

29:16.111 --> 29:19.205
- The hell you would!
- We're not here to get involved
in any kind of personal...

29:19.281 --> 29:22.216
He treats my mama with disrespect!
He treats me with disrespect!

29:22.284 --> 29:24.411
- Oh, shut up!
- We're not here to get involved
with personal problems.

29:24.486 --> 29:28.183
- See? You! You shut up!
- Settle down.

29:28.257 --> 29:30.623
[Sobbing]
He won't make love to me.

29:30.693 --> 29:32.627
Oh. Uh...

29:32.695 --> 29:34.663
- I should have never touched
your stupid ass!
- All right.

29:34.730 --> 29:37.631
- Oh, no, no!
- Look, you guys.

29:37.700 --> 29:41.466
Steve, Edy, the reason
why we are here...

29:41.537 --> 29:44.233
is because we are concerned
about your safety.

29:44.306 --> 29:46.240
- How's that?
- We're concerned about your lives.

29:46.308 --> 29:49.038
You witnessed a violent attack
right across the street from your house.

29:49.111 --> 29:51.944
So you say! I just saw
a rolled up boy with crazy hair!

29:52.014 --> 29:54.676
Well, take our word for it.
Because of your proximity to the attack,

29:54.750 --> 29:56.479
we think you may be
targeted as well.

29:56.552 --> 29:59.043
- Why? Because we called the police?
- No, no, no.

29:59.121 --> 30:01.954
That's not why.
I can't really explain it exactly, but...

30:02.024 --> 30:05.118
I think the key is to remain
unemotional, okay?

30:05.194 --> 30:08.163
Try to stay calm.
Try to keep your heart rate down.

30:08.230 --> 30:10.164
Try to keep your adrenaline down.
Try to...

30:10.232 --> 30:12.462
- Just try to relax.
- [Sobbing] Oh, no!

30:12.534 --> 30:15.059
Good luck! You don't know
who you're talkin'to about that!

30:15.137 --> 30:17.605
Oh, you!
[Sobbing]

30:17.673 --> 30:19.470
Yeah, I think maybe we should
stay here for a little while.

30:19.541 --> 30:21.475
All right, let's just...

30:21.543 --> 30:24.376
let's just...
let's just, uh, relax.

30:24.446 --> 30:26.573
Just relax.

30:27.750 --> 30:29.684
[Toilet Flushing]

30:29.752 --> 30:32.585
Mr. Mulder, lookee here.

30:32.655 --> 30:34.589
I got to go to bed.

30:37.693 --> 30:41.094
How ya doin', Edy?
You still upset?

30:43.198 --> 30:45.462
I'm scared.

30:45.534 --> 30:48.264
You're scared?

30:48.337 --> 30:50.464
I'm scared
he's gonna leave me.

30:50.539 --> 30:52.473
[Sobbing]

31:00.916 --> 31:03.680
Oh!

31:03.752 --> 31:05.686
No, man. No.

31:07.022 --> 31:09.149
You think we should
take 'em to a hotel?

31:11.160 --> 31:13.094
- We don't need no hotel.
- Mm-mmm.

31:13.162 --> 31:15.289
- We've been livin' in
this house for 17 years.
- Oh, yeah.

31:15.364 --> 31:17.298
- Ain't nobody gonna chase us out.
- Mm-mmm.

31:17.366 --> 31:19.596
- You're not afraid?
- Now, I didn't say that.

31:19.668 --> 31:22.034
I said ain't nobody
gonna chase us out.

31:22.104 --> 31:24.605
- Mm-mmm.
- No.

31:30.744 --> 31:33.611
Oh, God.
More of you?

31:33.680 --> 31:37.377
- Are we any closer to an arrest?
- I'm afraid not.

31:37.451 --> 31:39.442
- Mulder, what next?
- Well, I'd say...

31:39.519 --> 31:41.453
we should station
a couple deputies out here,

31:41.521 --> 31:43.455
but I don't think
it's coming back here.

31:43.523 --> 31:47.584
We're just playing catch-up with this
thing. It doesn't do what you'd expect.

31:47.661 --> 31:50.494
And, uh... Well, we got
four or five hours till the moon sets.

31:50.564 --> 31:54.193
The attacks only occur on a full moon.
Then we're out of luck.

31:54.267 --> 31:56.861
Well, I want to examine
Chantara Gomez.

31:56.937 --> 31:59.838
- [Mulder] For a possible contagion?
- Your contagion of fear?

31:59.906 --> 32:01.840
- Yeah. No?
- No.

32:01.908 --> 32:05.207
But if I can't figure out
what this thing was, at least
I can figure out what it wasn't.

32:05.278 --> 32:08.372
Make it fast.
And fill that tank up with gas.

32:08.448 --> 32:10.916
Uh, Deputy, you're the only person
that's seen this twice,

32:10.984 --> 32:13.145
so I'd like to ride with you
if you don't mind.

32:13.220 --> 32:15.620
- Let's go.
- Thanks.

32:32.973 --> 32:34.907
You really believe me,
huh?

32:34.975 --> 32:37.205
You really believe I saw
what I thought I saw?

32:37.277 --> 32:39.302
Yeah, I believe you.

32:39.379 --> 32:41.939
- Why?
- Why do I believe you?

32:42.015 --> 32:44.483
Yeah, I mean, what proof do you have
what I'm saying is real?

32:44.551 --> 32:46.781
I mean, it's not...
it's not on the videotape.

32:48.722 --> 32:50.917
The camera doesn't always
tell the whole story.

32:52.025 --> 32:53.959
And what about
your partner?

32:54.027 --> 32:55.961
Does she believe me?

32:57.297 --> 32:59.288
I don't think
she thinks you're lying.

33:00.534 --> 33:03.594
Yeah, but what?
Maybe I'm crazy?

33:03.670 --> 33:06.036
I've been on the job 18 months.
It's all I ever wanted to do.

33:06.106 --> 33:09.598
Right out of the gate,
I get some kind of rep like I'm crazy.

33:09.676 --> 33:11.974
I mean,
you know how cops are.

33:12.045 --> 33:14.946
How's somebody supposed
to live that down?

33:15.015 --> 33:17.506
I don't know.

33:17.584 --> 33:20.109
I guess just do
good work.

33:20.187 --> 33:22.655
I mean, it's a hard enough
job already, you know?

33:22.723 --> 33:25.248
You want to help people, but it's like
the freakin' wild west out here.

33:25.325 --> 33:27.259
You know people hate you?

33:28.595 --> 33:31.621
Every shift I go out
thinkin'...

33:31.698 --> 33:33.632
Go ahead.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.134
I go out thinkin', "You know,
there is somebody out there...

33:36.203 --> 33:38.398
"who wants to take me out.

33:38.472 --> 33:40.406
Am I gonna
run into him tonight?"

33:43.810 --> 33:46.745
It's hard to have a fast-track career
in law enforcement...

33:46.813 --> 33:49.475
when everybody thinks
you're nuts.

33:49.549 --> 33:51.483
Tell me about it.

33:51.551 --> 33:55.214
[Scully]
Chantara Gomez, age 31.

33:55.288 --> 33:57.813
Apparent cause of death
is the fracturing...

33:57.891 --> 34:00.257
of the second and third
cervical vertebrae.

34:00.327 --> 34:04.229
There are contusions
consistent with a choking...

34:04.297 --> 34:08.130
or a throttling
by very powerful hands.

34:08.201 --> 34:10.829
People are saying her pimp killed her
from beyond the grave.

34:12.371 --> 34:14.601
That's the story going around.
It's crazy, huh?

34:14.674 --> 34:17.302
Well, let's see if we can
put that story to rest, shall we?

34:18.844 --> 34:21.040
The other thing I heard
was, uh,

34:21.114 --> 34:23.047
something about contagion.

34:23.116 --> 34:25.208
- Like, with this body?
- [Chuckles]

34:25.284 --> 34:28.482
That's-That's completely
inaccurate.

34:28.554 --> 34:30.455
It's, uh...

34:30.524 --> 34:35.120
The investigation is... We're moving
towards an apparent chain of victims.

34:35.195 --> 34:37.719
And I seriously doubt that
we're gonna find anything...

34:37.797 --> 34:40.858
that looks like
a contagious pathology here.

34:40.934 --> 34:43.960
Because, I mean, if we were,
we should be taking precautions.

34:44.036 --> 34:47.495
If the body
could be contagious, you...

34:47.574 --> 34:49.542
We're not even
wearing masks.

34:49.609 --> 34:51.940
Look, this is obviously
a murder here.

34:52.012 --> 34:54.378
I mean, this woman died
of a broken neck, right?

34:54.447 --> 34:57.007
Not the hantavirus.

34:57.083 --> 34:59.574
- Who said anything about the hantavirus?
- Nobody.

34:59.653 --> 35:03.384
I just... I was, um...
It was a figure of speech.

35:05.325 --> 35:07.259
The reason I ask is,
why is it so urgent...

35:07.327 --> 35:10.228
to do an autopsy
at 3:00 in the morning?

35:10.297 --> 35:12.424
I mean, that kind of rush.
It's just unheard of.

35:14.167 --> 35:16.499
We are trying to look
for the killer.

35:18.305 --> 35:21.468
We got murder victims
stacked three deep in the freezer.

35:23.109 --> 35:25.976
Plus, you got this camera crew
recording everything. Why?

35:28.882 --> 35:31.316
Because the F.B.I.
Has nothing to hide.

35:34.087 --> 35:36.282
Look, there is
no ulterior motive here.

35:36.356 --> 35:38.654
It's...

35:38.725 --> 35:41.455
Are you gonna
help me out here or what?

35:41.528 --> 35:43.462
Yeah, of course.

35:43.530 --> 35:45.498
Thank you.

35:45.565 --> 35:47.499
Why did you mention
the hantavirus?

35:47.567 --> 35:52.027
- Look, l...
- [Sneezing]

35:52.105 --> 35:54.039
Oh, my God.

36:03.850 --> 36:08.287
- [Gagging]
- Call 911. Call 911!

36:08.355 --> 36:10.687
911! Get out of here!
Come on!

36:14.626 --> 36:16.560
[Scully]
It's not the hantavirus.

36:16.628 --> 36:19.529
It looks for all the world
like the hantavirus,

36:19.598 --> 36:23.261
but I can promise you
that it's not.

36:23.335 --> 36:25.963
Well, I mean, she exhibited
all the symptoms...

36:26.037 --> 36:29.165
the hemorrhagic fever,
the severe chills, acute shock...

36:29.241 --> 36:33.575
I mean, the thing is that they all
developed in a matter of seconds.

36:33.645 --> 36:36.239
And the hantavirus
doesn't kill that fast.

36:36.314 --> 36:39.181
I mean, no virus in the world
kills that fast.

36:40.719 --> 36:43.813
You were talking about the hantavirus
right before she died?

36:43.889 --> 36:47.484
- Why?
- Because she kept bringing it up.

36:47.559 --> 36:49.993
I mean, it was like
the power of suggestion, Mulder.

36:50.061 --> 36:54.088
She was standing there. She was saying
that she was afraid of contagion.

36:54.166 --> 36:56.259
And then all of a sudden,
she just...

36:56.334 --> 37:00.361
She was afraid.
She was afraid,

37:00.438 --> 37:03.930
and her fear killed her in the worst
possible way that she could imagine.

37:04.009 --> 37:05.943
- And what do you mean by that?
- It's the same.

37:06.011 --> 37:08.502
It's the same M.O., what we've been
looking for all night.

37:08.580 --> 37:13.449
This entity or force somehow
vectored off Chantara Gomez
to attack this other woman.

37:13.518 --> 37:15.816
No, Mulder.
I was standing right here.

37:15.887 --> 37:18.515
I didn't see anything.
They didn't see anything.

37:18.590 --> 37:20.785
Yeah, but you weren't afraid.

37:20.859 --> 37:23.589
The hell I wasn't afraid.
I don't know what's going on here.

37:23.662 --> 37:26.495
No, you weren't afraid
for your life.

37:26.565 --> 37:29.125
Neither were Steve and Edy,
and it left them alone.

37:29.201 --> 37:32.364
Mortal fear. I think
that's what it comes down to.

37:32.437 --> 37:35.338
This thing, whatever it is,
is attracted to that.

37:35.407 --> 37:38.570
Everybody who was attacked
felt that intensely.

37:38.643 --> 37:42.545
- For [Bleep] sakes.
- No, no, no. It makes perfect sense.

37:42.614 --> 37:45.674
You asked me earlier, "What would
this thing be doing in Willow Park?"

37:45.750 --> 37:47.911
Well, where else would it go
but a high-crime neighborhood?

37:47.986 --> 37:51.422
Somewhere where people live
behind barred windows and
are afraid to go out at night.

37:53.892 --> 37:57.157
- Where's Deputy Wetzel?
- Back on patrol.

37:57.229 --> 37:59.959
Mulder, you were... you were walking
around with him for three hours.

38:00.031 --> 38:01.931
- You didn't see anything?
- No, no. But I was with him.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.231
I was backing him up.

38:05.303 --> 38:08.704
[Wetzel] Like I said,
there's something about a full moon.

38:08.773 --> 38:10.764
Things definitely
get strange.

38:15.013 --> 38:18.949
Well, we checked
everyplace else tonight.

38:19.017 --> 38:20.951
Let's check this place again.

39:11.336 --> 39:14.066
[Whispering]
Aw! Come on.

39:15.240 --> 39:17.538
God... [Bleep]

39:17.609 --> 39:19.975
[Rumbling Overhead]

39:20.045 --> 39:22.570
- I'm callin' for backup.
- [Rumbling Continues]

39:22.647 --> 39:24.638
Get out!
Get out now! Get out!

39:24.716 --> 39:28.015
- It won't open!
- Let's go! I got it! I got it!

39:28.086 --> 39:31.522
- Come on! I can't open it!
- Oh, God!

39:31.589 --> 39:33.352
- [Shouting]
- [Rumbling Continues]

39:33.425 --> 39:36.417
Oh... [Bleep]

39:36.494 --> 39:38.428
[Siren Wailing]

39:44.302 --> 39:46.236
[Scully]
That's Wetzel's car.

40:08.526 --> 40:10.721
- Wetzel!
- Get the battering ram.

40:10.795 --> 40:12.729
Let's go around back.

40:21.806 --> 40:24.070
[Mulder]
That gun's not gonna do ya any good.

40:49.868 --> 40:52.666
[Banging]

40:52.737 --> 40:55.262
That's
the battering ram.

40:55.340 --> 40:57.672
Well, how come
they're not in yet?

40:57.742 --> 40:59.676
[Rumbling]

41:03.615 --> 41:06.413
- Wind?
- If you say so.

41:14.893 --> 41:17.623
- [Rattling]
- I wonder who's in there.

41:29.107 --> 41:31.871
[Both Screaming]

41:31.943 --> 41:34.503
Damn!

41:34.579 --> 41:36.740
- I hate you guys.
- Where's Wetzel?

41:36.815 --> 41:38.806
[Cameraman] We don't know.
There's something out there.

41:38.883 --> 41:41.215
- Stay where you are.
- [Bleep] yeah!

41:41.286 --> 41:44.414
Look at this. Scully.

41:44.489 --> 41:47.117
[Rumbling]

41:49.527 --> 41:52.496
- Deputy Wetzel?
- [Paula] Scully!

41:52.564 --> 41:54.498
Have you found him?

41:54.566 --> 41:57.000
[Rumbling Continues]

41:58.803 --> 42:00.737
Wetzel?

42:06.878 --> 42:09.904
- Wetzel?
- [Wetzel Screaming]

42:09.981 --> 42:12.506
- Wetzel!
- [Shouting, Indistinct]

42:14.586 --> 42:18.989
- Wetzel!
- Help me! Please help me!

42:19.057 --> 42:20.991
Wetzel,
don't be afraid!

42:21.059 --> 42:23.823
- It can't hurt you! Don't be afraid!
- [Shouting Continues]

42:23.895 --> 42:26.557
- That's what it wants! Look... Wetzel!
- Help me!

42:26.631 --> 42:30.863
It can't hurt you! You're a [Bleep]
Sheriff's deputy, Wetzel!

42:30.935 --> 42:35.099
Don't be afraid now! You're on
national television, so cowboy up!

42:35.173 --> 42:37.107
[Shouting Continues]

42:39.878 --> 42:41.812
Jeez!

42:49.454 --> 42:52.014
Wetzel.

42:52.090 --> 42:54.024
[Scully]
He's alive.

42:56.261 --> 42:57.956
- [Banging]
- [Male Offcer] Deputy Wetzel!

42:58.029 --> 42:59.963
We're up here!

43:00.031 --> 43:01.965
[Footsteps
Ascending Stairs]

43:08.439 --> 43:12.000
[Paula]
[Bleep] What happened?

43:14.445 --> 43:16.379
The sun just came up.

43:21.217 --> 43:23.151
Hang in there, kid.

43:24.587 --> 43:28.284
Do you think the deputy
stopped it, whatever it was?

43:28.357 --> 43:30.382
Maybe it just went away
until the next full moon.

43:31.994 --> 43:33.928
I don't know. You gotta figure
there's enough fear in the world...

43:33.996 --> 43:38.365
that if it doesn't show up in Willow
Park, it's gonna show up someplace else.

43:38.434 --> 43:40.834
You didn't get the proof
that you wanted, Mulder.

43:40.903 --> 43:43.633
Well, hey, it all depends
on how they edit it together.

43:43.706 --> 43:45.936
[Scully] This is gonna be
a hard one to write up.

43:46.008 --> 43:48.602
[Female Offcer On Radio]
132 at Bush. I've got him at gunpoint.

43:48.678 --> 43:52.614
[Female Dispatcher] Okay, gunpoint.
132 and Bush. Cover's code three.

44:25.080 --> 44:27.742
[Child]
I made this!
