WEBVTT

00:04.472 --> 00:05.771
<i> - When it comes to my cell,</i>

00:05.840 --> 00:08.440
<i> we are so confident</i>
<i> in each other that</i>

00:08.509 --> 00:11.577
<i> we all genuinely want</i>
<i> to get to a final together.</i>

00:11.645 --> 00:13.412
<i> That's our end goal.</i>
<i> all: Emerald!</i>

00:13.481 --> 00:15.881
- Today's mission is called
Million Dollar Heist.

00:15.950 --> 00:19.818
<i> - Ruby Cell is the only cell</i>
<i> that has not won a mission.</i>

00:19.887 --> 00:21.620
<i> That puts a lot</i>
<i> of pressure on me.</i>

00:21.689 --> 00:23.522
<i> We can't afford</i>
<i> to lose this mission.</i>

00:23.591 --> 00:26.492
- Big T, that's the wrong car.
- Big T, it's the wrong car!

00:26.560 --> 00:27.760
- [bleep]

00:28.963 --> 00:30.729
- All right, Emerald wins.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.131
This is just a little taste

00:32.199 --> 00:34.433
of what's to come in my final.

00:34.502 --> 00:35.968
- The decision
that we're gonna make

00:36.037 --> 00:39.338
is gonna be what's best
for ourselves and our cell.

00:39.407 --> 00:42.007
- I really want to go down
and fight tonight.

00:42.076 --> 00:45.344
Most likely I would want
to infiltrate Emerald's Cell.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.381
- Big T, the choice is yours.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.917
- Tonight, TJ,
I'm going up against Emy.

00:51.986 --> 00:54.453
- Go. Jump. Straight.

00:57.792 --> 00:59.425
- Whoo!

00:59.493 --> 01:03.529
- [indistinct].
four eliminations. Four and oh.

01:03.597 --> 01:06.865
- Well, Big T, you tried.
- Thank you, TJ.

01:06.934 --> 01:10.235
- You want to infiltrate and
steal any other cell up there?

01:10.304 --> 01:12.237
- I'm gonna rejoin Sapphire.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.874
<i> - I guarantee a guy's</i>
<i> going home soon.</i>

01:15.943 --> 01:18.710
<i> And after that,</i>
<i> is it gonna be the final?</i>

01:18.779 --> 01:20.846
<i> Like, are we right around</i>
<i> the corner?</i>

01:20.915 --> 01:23.816
<i> I can taste that final.</i>

01:36.964 --> 01:38.797
<i> - Whoo!</i>

01:40.401 --> 01:43.535
- The Em dog!

01:43.604 --> 01:45.537
- Yay!

01:45.606 --> 01:48.407
- No more cold showers
for the rest of my life.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.608
- What are you talking about?
[indistinct] got one

01:49.677 --> 01:51.810
lined up for you tomorrow.
- [chuckles]

01:51.879 --> 01:53.645
- Nah, you killed it.

02:17.404 --> 02:18.670
- No, no one
wants me in the Final.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.807
You know damn well people
don't want me in the Final.

02:21.876 --> 02:24.910
The thing is what are you
gonna do about it?

02:24.979 --> 02:27.346
'Cause if you come for me,
I'm coming for you.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.490
<i> - Hi.</i>
- Hey.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.192
Should I--should I come home
right now?

02:40.261 --> 02:43.362
I should come home?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.364
Or should they stay here
and win another million?

02:46.700 --> 02:49.568
- No, I might as well
just leave.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.273
- I miss you too.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.241
You know, I've done a lot
in these challenges.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.810
You know, multiple Final wins,

02:58.879 --> 03:01.847
<i> but one thing I haven't done</i>
<i> is win two in a row.</i>

03:01.916 --> 03:05.150
I think it'd be nice.
You know, add that to the,

03:05.219 --> 03:09.021
you know, the portfolio
of Challenge achievements.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.889
How's CJ?
<i> - CJ.</i>

03:10.958 --> 03:13.592
- Ooh-ooh!

03:13.661 --> 03:16.461
Hey! That's my buddy.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.363
Let me see how big you are.
Let me see your muscles.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.233
<i> - Show him your muscles.</i>
- What up, dude?

03:21.302 --> 03:24.803
Ay, hey! Yay, yay.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.872
[laughs]

03:26.941 --> 03:31.310
<i> - Where you at?</i>
- Oh, I'm at a secret location.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.478
But don't worry, I'm taking
care of some bad guys, buddy.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.148
Gotta get that ice cream money.

03:36.217 --> 03:39.251
<i> - Say what?</i>
- Say what?

03:39.320 --> 03:42.521
<i> - We love you. We miss you.</i>
- Bye.

03:50.331 --> 03:53.699
- What would you do if you won?
- I'd move to the States.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.767
- Move to United States?
- Yes.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.469
- Whoa!

03:57.538 --> 03:59.171
Where do you want to go
in the United States?

03:59.240 --> 04:00.372
Have you been there?
- Never.

04:00.441 --> 04:01.974
- Oh, my God.
Where do you want to go?

04:05.613 --> 04:07.546
- You would kill it in LA.

04:11.518 --> 04:14.653
And then, yeah.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.022
I want to win this season
because

04:17.091 --> 04:20.292
I want to help my family.
I've always wanted to--

04:20.361 --> 04:23.929
<i> Hey, I'm not gonna say</i>
<i> "get my family out of poverty"</i>

04:23.998 --> 04:26.265
<i> because we have</i>
<i> a place to live,</i>

04:26.333 --> 04:29.768
we have food but...

04:29.837 --> 04:32.004
<i> it has always been</i>
<i> a struggle with money.</i>

04:32.072 --> 04:35.907
So I'm trying to do
something good for my family.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.744
- Did you win "Survivor?"
- No, I came in second.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.078
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.448
Once you do it and then, like,

04:43.517 --> 04:46.418
you don't win, I don't know,

04:46.487 --> 04:48.053
I'm such a competitor
that now I'm addicted.

04:48.122 --> 04:50.522
I want to prove to myself
that I can actually do it.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.657
After everything
I've been through

04:51.725 --> 04:52.991
over the past couple years,

04:53.060 --> 04:54.559
I truly feel like I'm ready

04:54.628 --> 04:57.396
to step into that role
of being a Challenge champion.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.197
<i> I was with Jordan.</i>
<i> We got engaged.</i>

04:59.266 --> 05:01.099
- Marry me.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.505
- As of last year, we broke up.

05:06.573 --> 05:10.842
<i> - ♪ Feels like</i>
<i> I just woke up ♪</i>

05:10.911 --> 05:14.713
- It was incredibly difficult
to go through a breakup.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.682
I feel like I was
at the top of a mountain

05:16.750 --> 05:19.051
and I hit every rock
on the way down.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.555
- You think I'm gonna win
this season? Me too.

05:23.624 --> 05:24.990
<i> I don't need a man in my life</i>

05:25.059 --> 05:27.192
and I get to prove to myself
now that I'm not weak

05:27.261 --> 05:29.261
and that I'm strong
and that I can climb back up

05:29.330 --> 05:30.729
from any hole
that I've been in.

05:30.798 --> 05:33.865
<i> Winning this season is--</i>
<i> just feels so long overdue.</i>

05:33.934 --> 05:35.000
<i> And that's really</i>
<i> what I want to do.</i>

05:35.069 --> 05:37.302
<i> I want to win</i>
<i> that title for me.</i>

05:37.371 --> 05:42.574
<i> - ♪ No one stays the same ♪</i>

05:42.643 --> 05:44.976
<i> - ♪ Oh, oh ♪</i>

05:45.045 --> 05:50.716
<i> - ♪ Change is a thing</i>
<i> you can count on ♪</i>

05:50.784 --> 05:52.250
<i> - ♪ Oh, oh ♪</i>

05:52.319 --> 05:58.523
<i> - ♪ I feel</i>
<i> so much younger now ♪</i>

06:00.027 --> 06:01.126
- This game is--

06:01.195 --> 06:03.762
almost more than any other
that we've played,

06:03.831 --> 06:06.932
has more moving parts and--
and more

06:07.000 --> 06:10.969
opportunities in it
than any game I've seen.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.504
I had this conversation
with Chris.

06:12.573 --> 06:17.275
Both of us just now became
infinitely more valuable

06:17.344 --> 06:19.945
because it's no longer--

06:20.013 --> 06:22.581
especially him 'cause no one
wants to see him in elimination

06:22.649 --> 06:23.982
and everyone wants
to run it with him.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.651
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
I told CT before.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.687
I've made it abundantly clear

06:28.756 --> 06:29.955
I want to run
the final with him.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.357
'Cause he wins
[bleep] everything.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.494
<i> - CT, people know he's</i>
<i> a big threat in this game.</i>

06:35.562 --> 06:37.662
I've learned a lot
and I've seen a lot.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.065
If you take a CT to the final,

06:40.134 --> 06:42.834
<i> he will win it all.</i>
<i> We can't have that.</i>

06:42.903 --> 06:45.604
This is my season to win. Mine.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.210
<i> - Me and Devin</i>
<i> had a weird relationship.</i>

06:52.279 --> 06:53.745
<i> We're like brothers.</i>

06:53.814 --> 06:55.781
Devin in this game
has done a lot for me.

06:55.849 --> 06:58.049
He's protected me and he's won

06:58.118 --> 07:01.720
numerous amounts of times
and saved me

07:01.789 --> 07:03.255
and I want to pay that back.

07:03.323 --> 07:06.091
<i> If I win, I would do</i>
<i> everything I can to save him.</i>

07:06.160 --> 07:09.127
We'll probably end up
in there again, anyway.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.429
I will.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.864
And as long as--
if you don't win,

07:12.933 --> 07:14.733
then you've got a strong chance
of going in.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.868
- Hell yeah. Hell yeah.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.905
This entire game
I have made sure

07:19.973 --> 07:21.506
not to get ahead of myself,

07:21.575 --> 07:23.475
but it's really,
really difficult

07:23.544 --> 07:24.810
not to look ahead right now

07:24.878 --> 07:26.845
<i> 'cause we are on the brink</i>

07:26.914 --> 07:29.681
of potentially
the final male elimination.

07:29.750 --> 07:32.150
This is a must-win for Emerald.

07:32.219 --> 07:35.454
I'm not expecting
to get through this game

07:35.522 --> 07:36.788
without having to go in,

07:36.857 --> 07:38.890
but I certainly
would like that.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.960
And I hope that the deals
and the relationships

07:42.029 --> 07:43.361
that I've built
while I'm in here

07:43.430 --> 07:45.297
is enough to keep me out of it.

07:45.365 --> 07:47.199
Maybe.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.869
<i> - Okay, I understand</i>
<i> that Ruby--</i>

07:50.938 --> 07:54.339
I don't know why we have that,
like, we are so bad.

07:54.408 --> 07:58.176
But if you think like the--
the people is good.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.078
- Just mistakes, that's all.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.980
I'm happy to be
a part of your team.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.416
- I'm very competitive.
I love to win.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.618
It's the best thing ever.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.987
It's the only thing
that make me happy.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.690
I'm a rookie,
but I'm not idiot.

08:11.758 --> 08:14.426
I know everything
is happening around me.

08:14.495 --> 08:17.429
I am in the chopping block,
so I have to win to be safe.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.698
I wanna work for my team.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.601
And if we can, like,
protect together

08:22.669 --> 08:24.469
to maintain the team
is good for me.

08:24.538 --> 08:27.873
- Exactly, and I respect that.
- With some limits, obviously.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.408
<i> - Myself and Logan,</i>
<i> we are a strong team</i>

08:30.477 --> 08:32.210
<i> and I have to trust Logan,</i>

08:32.279 --> 08:35.080
but I haven't had the best
intuition about people.

08:35.148 --> 08:37.782
And I have been stabbed
in my back before.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.651
I'm all about working together,
getting the job done.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.286
- You have to--to trust
in your team.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.722
If not, it's stupid.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.757
- Without trust,
you don't have anything.

08:56.136 --> 08:59.070
[alarms blaring]

09:09.216 --> 09:10.916
- Ooh.

09:13.654 --> 09:14.920
- Hell yeah.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.393
- Whoo!

09:23.330 --> 09:25.130
- Wow.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.232
- Love to see it.

09:28.535 --> 09:31.770
- All right, agents.
Welcome to your next mission.
- Hate to see it.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.375
Today's mission
is called Dead Drop.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.915
Hanging out over the water
is a gauntlet.

09:45.485 --> 09:50.088
And on one end of the gauntlet
are ten top secret capsules.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.959
<i> You're gonna have to</i>
<i> navigate that gauntlet</i>

09:54.027 --> 09:56.094
all while trying
to avoid the bombs

09:56.163 --> 09:59.197
that are being winged at you
from the opposing cells.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.999
You get knocked off
into the water,

10:01.068 --> 10:03.268
you can climb up and try again.

10:03.337 --> 10:06.471
However, if you get knocked off
into the water with a capsule,

10:06.540 --> 10:08.373
that capsule is dead.

10:08.442 --> 10:11.810
The cell that transfers
the most capsules the fastest

10:11.878 --> 10:15.981
will win today's mission
and become our Agency. Got it?

10:16.049 --> 10:17.449
- Got it.
- Got it.

10:17.517 --> 10:18.650
- All right, agents, let's go.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.385
Good luck.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.287
- Bombs away, baby!

10:23.690 --> 10:26.291
<i> - Sapphire Cell up first.</i>

10:26.360 --> 10:27.993
Ready? Go.

10:35.202 --> 10:39.437
<i> - Classic CT,</i>
<i> just absolutely beasting this.</i>

10:39.506 --> 10:41.172
- Yeah, CT, nice.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.310
<i> - Right now, he's figured out</i>

10:45.379 --> 10:50.482
that you too can use these
bombs to your advantage.

10:50.550 --> 10:51.983
<i> You can hold onto 'em.</i>

10:52.052 --> 10:54.119
<i> You can throw 'em</i>
<i> back at people.</i>

10:54.187 --> 10:55.453
This is gonna be a problem.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.391
- Oh, God.
- [bleep]

10:59.459 --> 11:02.794
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- [bleep]

11:05.298 --> 11:06.798
- Whoo!

11:08.135 --> 11:11.236
- That's it, Kyle,
there you go!

11:16.143 --> 11:18.843
- Throw me out the plane,
throw me out the helicopter.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.478
I'll do anything like that.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.947
But throw me into some water?
Don't like it.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.849
Could fall wrong. Hate it.

11:27.421 --> 11:29.154
- Whoa.

11:35.629 --> 11:37.362
- Oh!
- Whoo!

11:43.537 --> 11:46.538
- Today's mission
is called Drop Dead.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.139
<i> You gotta run across</i>
<i> an obstacle course</i>

11:48.208 --> 11:49.808
<i> hanging over the ocean.</i>

11:49.876 --> 11:51.876
While you're running across,
the opposing teams are gonna be

11:51.945 --> 11:54.079
swinging bombs into you
trying to knock you off.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.281
The team with
the most capsules wins.

11:56.349 --> 11:59.451

I'm gonna use this bomb

19:27.333 --> 19:29.500

26:18.678 --> 26:20.044
<i> - Devin's definitely</i>
<i> getting nervous</i>

26:20.112 --> 26:21.779
because it's getting
to that time where

26:21.847 --> 26:23.447
people are willing to do
whatever they have to do

26:23.516 --> 26:24.715
to stay in the game.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.050
And I think that
Devin's afraid that

26:26.118 --> 26:27.918
he might get called out
in an elimination.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.256
- Whoa!

26:39.765 --> 26:42.032
- Kaycee's so strong
at everything,

26:42.101 --> 26:43.500
<i> but she's not</i>
<i> the kind of person</i>

26:43.569 --> 26:46.637
<i> that walks around like</i>
<i> she's better than everybody.</i>

26:46.706 --> 26:48.806
She's very humble.
She's very calm.

26:48.874 --> 26:50.641
She knows her abilities.

26:50.710 --> 26:53.978
I am so proud of her.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.779
- Hit him.

26:57.216 --> 27:00.150
- Oh, oh, come on!
- Whoa!

27:06.425 --> 27:08.626
- Get him!
Light him up, light him up!

27:24.443 --> 27:26.377
<i> - I ate [bleep].</i>

27:26.445 --> 27:27.811
Good shot, Tori.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.847
I [bleep] hate you,
but good shot.

27:45.498 --> 27:48.799
- [bleep]

27:48.868 --> 27:50.434
- Good job, Emanual.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.008
<i> - If our cell doesn't win,</i>

27:58.077 --> 28:02.279
the risk of me going in
is major.

28:02.348 --> 28:04.948
<i> And I really want</i>
<i> to go to the final.</i>

28:05.017 --> 28:07.151
<i> If I get to that final,</i>

28:07.219 --> 28:08.852
there's no way
I'm not gonna win.

28:13.426 --> 28:14.758
- Whoo!

28:14.827 --> 28:16.927
- Nice.
[airhorn blows]

28:16.996 --> 28:18.796
All right, time. Good job.

28:21.634 --> 28:24.868
- Emerald Cell gets
seven capsules as well,

28:24.937 --> 28:26.937
which means it's gonna
come down to time.

28:27.006 --> 28:28.105
Who got it quicker?

28:28.174 --> 28:31.175
<i> Was it Emerald or was it CT?</i>

28:36.315 --> 28:37.815
- Great job today.

28:40.686 --> 28:44.421
Two cells got seven
top secret capsules today.

28:45.991 --> 28:50.394
That's the Sapphire Cell
and the Emerald Cell.

28:50.463 --> 28:53.363
So it all came down to time.

28:53.432 --> 28:57.067
- I am praying that
my team wins the Agency.

28:57.136 --> 29:00.637
<i> I do not want to see</i>
<i> either of the guys on my team</i>

29:00.706 --> 29:03.907
go into elimination so I'm just
crossing my fingers,

29:03.976 --> 29:05.943
hoping that somehow
we pull it through.

29:06.011 --> 29:10.414
- The one cell
to get it done the fastest...

29:10.483 --> 29:11.849
was...

29:17.957 --> 29:22.693
- The one cell to get it done
the fastest...

29:22.762 --> 29:25.963
was...

29:29.401 --> 29:30.400
Sapphire Cell.

29:30.469 --> 29:33.237
[all scream]

29:37.810 --> 29:40.677
[squeals]
<i> - Aye!</i>

29:40.746 --> 29:43.847
I believe this is my 55th

29:43.916 --> 29:45.415
daily Challenge win.

29:45.484 --> 29:48.152
- Uncle CT!
- Still in the Agency.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.521
- Who's keeping count?

29:50.589 --> 29:52.656
<i> Proud of this one.</i>

29:52.725 --> 29:54.725
- So Sapphire Cell,

29:54.794 --> 29:56.093
you are now the Agency,

29:56.162 --> 29:58.796
thanks to your fearless leader,
CT.

29:58.864 --> 30:01.064
- Stop. Making it weird.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.667
- I need you to go back
to Headquarters, deliberate,

30:03.736 --> 30:07.504
and compromise one male agent
to send into the Lair.

30:07.573 --> 30:11.108
All right, agents.
I'll see you there.

30:12.878 --> 30:16.580
- [chuckles] Well done, CT.

30:16.649 --> 30:19.183
Kyle and Emy,
you were there as well.

30:23.689 --> 30:26.290
- Whoo!

30:26.358 --> 30:28.292
I'm a winner!

30:28.360 --> 30:32.796
I'm a winner! I'm a winner!

30:32.865 --> 30:36.300
Losers! Losers!

30:37.469 --> 30:40.170
Yes! Pulled off the win!

30:40.239 --> 30:43.674
I am the greatest Challenge
competitor of all time.

30:43.742 --> 30:46.577
It's me. I'm the winner.

30:46.645 --> 30:49.279
Everyone else is the loser.

30:49.348 --> 30:54.184
Well, CT won,
but I was there as well.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.654
We are the winners,
you are the losers.

30:57.723 --> 31:00.157
Le-hoo-zuh-hers!

31:00.226 --> 31:03.560
- Kyle, you've won one thing
the entire time

31:03.629 --> 31:05.329
you've been here, man.

31:05.397 --> 31:08.765
Win with a little grace,
you little [bleep].

31:08.834 --> 31:10.667
<i> - We killed it.</i>
<i> [both laugh]</i>

31:15.641 --> 31:18.675
- Big win today, Dev.
- Yeah, you guys crushed it.

31:18.744 --> 31:20.110
- Thanks, man.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.179
- Absolutely crushed it.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.682
- I mean, CT crushed it.

31:25.751 --> 31:28.785
- Hey, it's all right, though.
Can't win them all.

31:28.854 --> 31:31.288
- No. - We all tried

31:31.357 --> 31:33.924
and it is what it is, really.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.158
- Yup.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.995
Just have to come up with

31:38.063 --> 31:40.297
a few ideas

31:40.366 --> 31:42.132
of what we're gonna do.

31:42.201 --> 31:47.004
The best way to save you.

31:47.072 --> 31:50.941
- Yeah, I mean,
I appreciate that.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.442
- Now that I'm in the Agency,

31:52.511 --> 31:54.044
I want to pay back the favors

31:54.113 --> 31:55.612
that have been done for me.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.048
And I do want to keep
Devin safe in here

31:58.117 --> 32:01.318
because he repeatedly
hasn't voted me in

32:01.387 --> 32:02.986
<i> and I want to</i>
<i> pay back my friend.</i>

32:03.055 --> 32:05.555
Hopefully,
whoever we vote into the Lair

32:05.624 --> 32:06.890
won't pick Devin.

32:06.959 --> 32:09.960
- At this stage in the game,
if somebody calls me out,

32:10.029 --> 32:11.194
they call me out, you know,

32:11.263 --> 32:13.931
and then I got to
just get down there and--

32:13.999 --> 32:17.935
and earn my--earn my spot.

32:18.003 --> 32:21.672
This [bleep] close.
- Yeah.

32:21.740 --> 32:25.375
<i> - ♪ I feel so close to you</i>
<i> right now ♪</i>

32:25.444 --> 32:29.379
<i> ♪ It's a forcefield ♪</i>

32:29.448 --> 32:33.016

- Okay, this is beautiful.
- Whoo.

32:49.134 --> 32:52.736
- Whoo!

32:52.805 --> 32:54.638
- So here you go.

32:54.707 --> 33:00.644

33:03.082 --> 33:05.248

33:16.028 --> 33:23.166

33:29.241 --> 33:30.574
- Good job today, guys.

33:30.642 --> 33:33.243
First of all,
great [bleep] job.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.644
- We tried.
- We tried.

33:34.713 --> 33:37.080
- Yeah, sorry that
we couldn't really come through

33:37.149 --> 33:39.850
the way that we wanted to,
obviously.

33:39.918 --> 33:42.452
- But, um,

33:42.521 --> 33:45.255
when it comes down to,
like, the Agency vote,

33:45.324 --> 33:47.758
I feel like
you're in a pretty good place

33:47.826 --> 33:52.429
because of who won.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.499
- Yeah.
- I'm not sure about you.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.368
- The final feels so close.

33:58.437 --> 34:02.072
I feel like
it's just around the corner

34:02.141 --> 34:04.508
and all this work I've done,

34:04.576 --> 34:08.979
and all these political
strategies I've been building

34:09.048 --> 34:11.782
<i> and everything I've done,</i>

34:11.850 --> 34:13.884
<i> to, like, be reined in,</i>

34:13.952 --> 34:17.721
I would be heartbroken.

34:17.790 --> 34:20.090
- Have you heard of anyone
wanting to volunteer to go in?

34:20.159 --> 34:22.125
- No.
- No?

34:22.194 --> 34:23.560
- Nobody wants to.

34:23.629 --> 34:26.696
It's so--it could be
the last guys' elimination.

34:26.765 --> 34:29.099
The last elimination.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.102
- But whoever goes down there

34:32.171 --> 34:33.804
is gonna be looking
at the two of us.

34:33.872 --> 34:37.641
If it's anything speed
or strength related,

34:37.709 --> 34:38.675
it's your boy.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.912
If it's anything
size or weight-related,

34:41.980 --> 34:44.481
it's you.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.157
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers. Cheers, y'all.

34:54.226 --> 34:56.493
- Ruby until death.
Ruby's never won anything

34:56.562 --> 35:00.664
but that doesn't mean that
Ruby can't win the big thing.

35:00.732 --> 35:02.799
There's a good chance that
one of you guys is going in.

35:05.170 --> 35:06.670
- Um, you know,

35:06.738 --> 35:09.172
I think they know
we are a threat.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.941
<i> I think CT, I think how--</i>

35:11.009 --> 35:13.543
and, who knows, we all have
our good friends in this,

35:13.612 --> 35:15.579
but they know this is the final

35:15.647 --> 35:16.980
and they gonna do
what's best for them,

35:17.049 --> 35:19.683
so I think my head's
on the chopping block.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.251
I think your head's
on the chopping block.

35:21.320 --> 35:23.186
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.557
- If you go in
and you don't pick each other

35:27.626 --> 35:30.427
and you come back to Ruby,
we have a good [bleep] shot.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.334
- I gave him my word.
I'm a man of my word.

35:39.104 --> 35:42.506
Ruby to death. I don't know
if I can trust Logan.

35:42.574 --> 35:46.610
Hopefully, he doesn't stab me
in the back.

36:09.234 --> 36:11.668
<i> - Any of these male</i>

36:11.737 --> 36:14.004
<i> who are not safe</i>
<i> can go into elimination.</i>

36:14.072 --> 36:19.342
<i> Nelson, Emanual,</i>
<i> Logan, Devin, any of them.</i>

36:19.411 --> 36:20.777
<i> And I want to listen</i>
<i> to everyone</i>

36:20.846 --> 36:22.012
and I just want
to figure it out;

36:22.080 --> 36:24.414
<i> who's lying</i>
<i> and who's not lying</i>

36:24.483 --> 36:26.950
<i> 'cause a lot of people can</i>

36:27.019 --> 36:28.451
kiss asses before the final.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.320
<i> I just want to see</i>
<i> who's real and who's not.</i>

36:30.389 --> 36:31.922
<i> Who really wants to be here.</i>

36:31.990 --> 36:33.190
It's a really tough
decision for me.

36:33.258 --> 36:37.327
It will be tough though.
I know it.

36:38.130 --> 36:41.932
<i> - Agency, you have 20 minutes</i>
<i> to gather intel.</i>

36:42.000 --> 36:44.534
<i> Then you must compromise</i>
<i> one agent</i>

36:44.603 --> 36:46.169
<i> and send them into the Lair.</i>

36:46.238 --> 36:48.738
<i> Use this time wisely.</i>

36:49.775 --> 36:51.341
- Yeah.

36:51.410 --> 36:54.110
Who's got some intel?

36:54.179 --> 36:55.812
Anyone want to take it away?

36:55.881 --> 36:57.814
- Yeah, I'll kick us off,
I guess.

36:57.883 --> 37:01.051
I see three friends here
as the Agency.

37:01.119 --> 37:04.020
And I hope that
you all value that friendship

37:04.089 --> 37:05.755
as much as I do.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.157
I don't want to be
the Headquarters vote.

37:07.226 --> 37:08.491
It's pretty obvious.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.462
And I get it,
there's eyes on me.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.733
If someone wants
to call me out down there

37:16.802 --> 37:18.201
'cause they see
something physical

37:18.270 --> 37:20.170
and they think
I'm just gonna lay down,

37:20.239 --> 37:22.939
you got another thing coming.

37:23.008 --> 37:25.208
When I want to turn it on,
I can turn it on.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.077
If anyone thinks
they're gonna call me out

37:27.145 --> 37:28.678
and I'm just gonna
go down there and say,

37:28.747 --> 37:31.348
"Okay, good luck in the final,"
you're [bleep] wrong.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.650
You're getting
everything I have.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.321
- If I become
Headquarters vote,

37:38.390 --> 37:41.891
hopefully, you don't
come for revenge, Devin.

37:41.960 --> 37:45.895
But, um, I'm gonna do
what I have to do down there.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.932
Because I want to run
in this final.

37:50.135 --> 37:53.937
He's no physical aspect.
He's okay with puzzles.

37:54.006 --> 37:56.006
<i> But I know that</i>
<i> I'm on the chopping block</i>

37:56.074 --> 37:58.975
and even though Devin and I
are friends in this game,

37:59.044 --> 38:02.445
<i> it's about that time</i>
<i> I put myself first.</i>

38:02.514 --> 38:04.547
We're at a point where

38:04.616 --> 38:06.583
the final's
right around the corner.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.718
This has always been
a dream of mine.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.254
This has always been
a goal of mine to accomplish,

38:11.323 --> 38:14.357
and I will die down there.

38:14.426 --> 38:17.093
I'm gonna give it all I got.

38:17.162 --> 38:18.828
- Any recommendations for us?

38:18.897 --> 38:22.198
I mean, green team's looking
real strong in this final--

38:22.267 --> 38:23.466
- Yeah, I was gonna say...

38:29.841 --> 38:30.974
- Why?

38:36.615 --> 38:38.114
- Say more.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.083
It is important for me
to--to protect Emanual

38:40.152 --> 38:42.819
as best as I can because
he's my Romanian friend.

38:42.888 --> 38:44.421
We both come from
the same country,

38:44.489 --> 38:45.755
from the same hood

38:45.824 --> 38:48.858
<i> and we need</i>
<i> to protect each other.</i>

38:48.927 --> 38:51.227
This is how
real friendships go.

38:51.296 --> 38:53.363
- That's all I know.
- I mean, you're the only guy

38:53.432 --> 38:56.599
who hasn't gone in
out of--of us.

38:58.170 --> 39:01.504
- Might want to defend
yourself here, bud.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.575
<i> - Emanual's the only rookie</i>

39:05.644 --> 39:06.976
who hasn't been
into the Lair so far,

39:07.045 --> 39:08.478
and he has probably
one of the best political games

39:08.547 --> 39:10.280
I've ever seen
because I don't know

39:10.349 --> 39:12.282
<i> how he's avoided it over bets.</i>

39:12.351 --> 39:14.551
<i> And there might be a chance</i>
<i> that he could</i>

39:14.619 --> 39:16.586
slither his way
out of this one too.

39:18.256 --> 39:20.423
- You guys aren't really
giving us anything here.

39:20.492 --> 39:23.660
You're just sitting around
being like, "don't pick me."

39:23.729 --> 39:26.096
Okay, I get that. But--

39:26.164 --> 39:28.198
- Sell souls, guys, come on.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.533
<i> - I know I haven't</i>
<i> been down there,</i>

39:30.602 --> 39:32.469
but going down there,

39:32.537 --> 39:34.637
it doesn't mean
you prove yourself.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.107
This is not a way
to proving yourself.

39:37.175 --> 39:39.442
You just have to stay away
from the Lair.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.544
And that's what
I'm trying to do.

39:47.219 --> 39:49.619
- I think we respect
each other too much for that...

39:49.688 --> 39:50.920
- Oh, come on.
- To be honest with you.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.689
It's not "come on," Amanda.
This is not a game.

39:52.758 --> 39:55.125
- It's a million dollars.

39:57.596 --> 39:59.629
- So who--who then? Who then?

39:59.698 --> 40:02.499
Out of all four of you,
who do you think?

40:04.536 --> 40:07.070
- I can't--
I wish I can say a name, CT.

40:07.139 --> 40:09.105
I wish I could.
But we don't know

40:09.174 --> 40:10.907
what the elimination's
gonna unfold, man.

40:10.976 --> 40:13.510
Nobody's gonna sit here
and volunteer their self

40:13.578 --> 40:18.181
to go down there
and maybe even go home.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.455
- It's not really--
look, all right.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.390
You know what, [bleep].
Look, it's not really hard.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.859
Everybody is assuming--
everybody's hoping for Emanual

40:29.928 --> 40:31.394
because he hasn't gone in yet.

40:31.463 --> 40:32.595
There's five of them
on that team.

40:32.664 --> 40:33.897
And if we're gonna
weaken Emerald,

40:33.965 --> 40:35.331
we should be taking
the shot at him.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.800
He hasn't gone in.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.134
He's done more for me,
you've done more for me,

40:38.203 --> 40:40.970
you've done more for me.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.505
Let's be honest.
We all know what time it is.

40:42.574 --> 40:43.640
Me and him have been great,

40:43.708 --> 40:45.108
but it just comes down
to these numbers.

40:45.177 --> 40:47.177
Stop bull[bleep], people.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.080
One of you guys say something

40:51.149 --> 40:55.351
or do something
that saves your ass.

40:55.420 --> 40:57.020
Like, both of you
keep saying you're gonna do

40:57.088 --> 40:58.988
different things all the time
so we can't get a read on it.

40:59.057 --> 41:00.256
It's like, you're both
just saying what you think

41:00.325 --> 41:02.492
somebody is gonna hear,
which makes trusting

41:02.561 --> 41:04.027
either one of you impossible.

41:05.931 --> 41:08.531
So I'm just as confused
as anybody else at this point.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.633
Like nobody knows
what anybody's gonna do.

41:10.702 --> 41:11.968
It's all gonna happen
when we get there,

41:12.037 --> 41:13.269
people are gonna see what it is

41:13.338 --> 41:15.872
and they're gonna
do what they can to survive.

41:15.941 --> 41:17.407
That's what's gonna happen.
So guys,

41:17.476 --> 41:19.943
somebody's gonna get sabotaged
one way or another here.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.778
<i> Nobody wants to go in.</i>
<i> at the same time,</i>

41:21.847 --> 41:24.314
nobody wants to
say a name because

41:24.382 --> 41:25.815
nobody wants to get called out.

41:25.884 --> 41:29.986
But this is the last
elimination before the final

41:30.055 --> 41:33.089
and nobody's fighting for it.
I'm getting frustrated.

41:38.029 --> 41:40.830
<i> - Agency, your time is up.</i>

41:43.068 --> 41:46.903
<i> You must now select</i>
<i> one player to compromise.</i>

41:58.717 --> 42:01.751
<i> - Nobody knows</i>
<i> what anybody's gonna do.</i>

42:01.820 --> 42:03.586
People are gonna see
what it is and they're gonna

42:03.655 --> 42:06.523
do what they can to survive.

42:06.591 --> 42:08.525
So guys,
somebody's gonna get sabotaged

42:08.593 --> 42:11.694
one way or another here.

42:11.763 --> 42:14.330
<i> - Agency, your time is up.</i>

42:14.399 --> 42:17.634
<i> You must now select</i>
<i> one player to compromise.</i>

42:53.104 --> 42:54.671
- Logie.
- Good luck, Logan.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.139
- Good luck, Logan.
- Good luck, brother.

42:56.207 --> 42:57.907
<i> - Emy's protecting Emanual,</i>
<i> of course.</i>

42:57.976 --> 42:59.576
So we compromise Logan.

42:59.644 --> 43:00.743
- Good luck.

43:00.812 --> 43:02.178
- Go do what you gotta do
down there, man.

43:02.247 --> 43:05.114
- When I had the power,
I save Emy.

43:05.183 --> 43:07.450
<i> I protect CT all the time,</i>

43:07.519 --> 43:09.385
but it's not enough?

43:09.454 --> 43:12.989
<i> This is a betray</i>
<i> I'm not gonna forget.</i>

43:16.261 --> 43:17.794
<i> - Ha-ha, Logan!</i>

43:17.862 --> 43:19.963
Don't trust him,
don't like him.

43:20.031 --> 43:21.998
Get yourself
in the Lair, buddy.

43:23.168 --> 43:26.836
- Good luck, Logan.
<i> - Buena suerte.</i>

43:33.211 --> 43:36.045
- First of all,
I just want to say

43:36.114 --> 43:37.380
good luck tonight, brother.

43:37.449 --> 43:40.416
I understand that, um,
we're all friends here.

43:40.485 --> 43:43.453
But...we're in
the final now, brother,

43:43.521 --> 43:44.754
there's nothing more we can do.

43:44.823 --> 43:46.022
If I was in
the same position as you,

43:46.091 --> 43:47.724
I would be helping you.
That's what friends do.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.525
We help each other
get as far as we can.

43:49.594 --> 43:52.028
And then we play for ourselves.

43:52.097 --> 43:53.963
- You didn't ask
to be put in this position.

43:54.032 --> 43:55.932
You said,
"I don't want to be here."

43:56.001 --> 43:58.201
So it's not like
it's your fault.

43:58.269 --> 43:59.769
Ultimately,
you have to make a decision

43:59.838 --> 44:01.738
and you're gonna do
whatever is best for you,

44:01.806 --> 44:03.606
but you didn't ask to be here.

44:03.675 --> 44:06.042
<i> - We made a deal. I said,</i>
<i> "Okay, Nelson, you are safe."</i>

44:06.111 --> 44:08.277
<i> That's true,</i>
<i> but I'm very competitive</i>

44:08.346 --> 44:12.148
and I love to win.
It's the best thing ever.

44:12.217 --> 44:14.484
It's the only thing
that make me happy.

44:14.552 --> 44:17.320
<i> I don't know</i>
<i> which one I'm gonna pick.</i>

44:17.389 --> 44:19.722
I want to play this season.
It's my first one.

44:19.791 --> 44:20.990
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

44:21.059 --> 44:23.760
I don't want to make mistakes.

44:25.997 --> 44:27.563
- Goddamn, I was fishing
in that deliberation

44:27.632 --> 44:28.998
and got nothing.
- Yeah.

44:29.067 --> 44:31.267
Control the controllables, bro.
- [imitates fishing cast]

44:31.336 --> 44:35.338
- I would be a little
surprised, you know,

44:35.407 --> 44:38.474
if out of the three options
he went with me.

44:38.543 --> 44:40.443
But, you know, I gotta--

44:40.512 --> 44:42.412
I gotta hope for something
strategy based.

44:42.480 --> 44:45.481
I've been saving it, you know,
for when I need it.

44:45.550 --> 44:48.518
I feel confident either way.

44:48.586 --> 44:50.953
I can beat him. If I have to.

44:51.022 --> 44:54.290
Got some heavy hitters
on my on--my beating list.

44:54.359 --> 44:55.692
You know, no matter
who goes down there,

44:55.760 --> 44:57.293
it's gonna be a good fight.

44:57.362 --> 44:58.528
There's not--
there's no one weak left.

44:58.596 --> 45:01.798
That's why we're here.

45:06.671 --> 45:11.040
- It's one of me or Devin.

45:11.109 --> 45:14.243
I guess we'll wait and see.

45:14.312 --> 45:16.379
- Yeah, they could have thrown
in either Devin or Nelson,

45:16.448 --> 45:18.314
but they decided
to throw in Logan again.

45:18.383 --> 45:22.452
But I think he's planning on
going against one of you guys.

45:22.520 --> 45:23.853
I mean, it sucks.
I feel like either way

45:23.922 --> 45:25.855
I'm losing somebody
I really care about.

45:25.924 --> 45:27.056
I don't want you to go

45:27.125 --> 45:28.991
and I definitely
don't want Devin to go.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.226
- And you don't want
Logan to go.

45:30.295 --> 45:31.527
- And I don't want Logan
to go.

45:31.596 --> 45:34.564
So no matter what,
tonight, I'm gonna be sad.

45:34.632 --> 45:36.566
There is no win.

45:44.943 --> 45:48.644
- Oh!

45:48.713 --> 45:52.615
Who's gonna leave?

45:52.684 --> 45:54.917
- Uh-oh.

45:54.986 --> 45:59.789
- Ready for fight.

45:59.858 --> 46:01.891
<i> - Logan,</i>
<i> I made a deal with him,</i>

46:01.960 --> 46:03.426
but I never feel safe.

46:03.495 --> 46:05.561
I never feel comfortable
in this game

46:05.630 --> 46:09.332
<i> because you see my loyalty,</i>
<i> you see my trust.</i>

46:09.400 --> 46:13.202
<i> Those things just come back</i>
<i> and bite me in the ass.</i>

46:13.271 --> 46:15.271
I don't know if I'm safe, man.

46:49.374 --> 46:52.074
- All right, agents,
welcome back to the Lair.

46:55.914 --> 46:57.547
Sapphire Cell,

46:57.615 --> 46:59.215
by winning the last mission,

46:59.284 --> 47:01.050
you became the Agency,

47:01.119 --> 47:04.887
and you were tasked with
compromising one male agent.

47:04.956 --> 47:07.590
You chose Logan.

47:07.659 --> 47:09.325
Logan, come on down.

47:09.394 --> 47:10.593
- Go, Logan.
- Go, Logan.

47:10.662 --> 47:14.230
- Good luck, Logan.

47:21.506 --> 47:22.738
- All right, Logan,

47:22.807 --> 47:25.107
we need to find someone
for you to battle against

47:25.176 --> 47:28.244
and the decision is yours.
- Yep.

47:28.313 --> 47:31.214
- It can be anyone
from either the Ruby Cell

47:31.282 --> 47:33.683
or the Emerald Cell.
Who's it gonna be?

47:41.793 --> 47:45.194
- I'm gonna make this
with pain in my heart.

47:48.933 --> 47:51.067
Difficult for me,

47:51.135 --> 47:54.003
but I have to call
one of my friends.

47:54.072 --> 47:56.305
I don't have many options here.

47:56.374 --> 48:01.143
Sorry, but I didn't want this.

48:14.425 --> 48:17.426
- All right, Logan,
who's it gonna be?

48:17.495 --> 48:20.930
- I'm gonna make this
with pain in my heart.

48:20.999 --> 48:23.232
So I have to call
one of my friends.

48:28.106 --> 48:31.507
It's difficult for me.

48:31.576 --> 48:34.810
I'm gonna call Emanual.
Sorry, bro.

48:36.814 --> 48:38.447
<i> - Wow.</i>

48:38.516 --> 48:40.883
Somebody that keep their word
in this game,

48:40.952 --> 48:42.618
<i> man, that means a lot.</i>

48:42.687 --> 48:45.121
<i> That's somebody you can trust</i>
<i> and want to keep by your side.</i>

48:45.189 --> 48:47.790
Respect to you, Logan.

48:47.859 --> 48:50.192
- Sorry, man.

48:50.261 --> 48:51.494
<i> - Let's go. I'm safe.</i>

48:51.562 --> 48:53.996
And I'm likely
going to the final.

48:54.065 --> 48:56.098
♪ Final dance, final dance ♪

48:56.167 --> 48:57.967
♪ I'm the man, I'm the man ♪

48:58.036 --> 49:00.403
Ooh! Yeah!

49:02.173 --> 49:04.040
<i> - Logan, why did you</i>
<i> call me down?</i>

49:04.108 --> 49:05.308
I'm going to kick your ass

49:05.376 --> 49:07.510
and I don't want that.

49:07.578 --> 49:09.879
- Wow.

49:09.948 --> 49:12.181
<i> - I have to call Emanual</i>

49:12.250 --> 49:14.450
<i> because at the end,</i>

49:14.519 --> 49:18.988
if you brag your worth once,

49:19.057 --> 49:22.825
it's gonna follow
all your life.

49:22.894 --> 49:24.360
- At least it wasn't our boy.

49:24.429 --> 49:27.463
- Devin got saved?
I thought he was calling Devin.

49:27.532 --> 49:31.167
- Two monsters going at it,
head to head.

49:31.235 --> 49:33.135
I love it.

49:33.204 --> 49:37.106
Tonight's game
is called Rocket Run.

49:41.112 --> 49:43.546
Dividing the Lair
are two rockets

49:43.614 --> 49:46.148
with a podium on each side.

49:46.217 --> 49:48.951
When I say "Go,"
you will have 15 seconds

49:49.020 --> 49:52.054
to race from your start podium,
jump over the rocket,

49:52.123 --> 49:53.756
pull the lever
on the opposite side,

49:53.825 --> 49:57.059
jump back over the rocket,
pull this lever.

49:57.128 --> 49:58.627
We'll keep doing this

49:58.696 --> 50:03.466
until one of you
fails to finish in 15 seconds.

50:04.802 --> 50:07.403
If you fail to finish,
you are out.

50:07.472 --> 50:10.473
You will be deactivated
immediately and sent home.

50:10.541 --> 50:13.075
All right? Good luck.

50:13.144 --> 50:14.944
- Go, go, Emanual.
- Let's go!

50:15.013 --> 50:17.313
- Let's go, boys.
- Whoo!

50:19.817 --> 50:21.150
- Bad pick, Logie.

50:21.219 --> 50:23.419
- Let's go, Logan.

50:28.626 --> 50:30.192
<i> - I've been here before.</i>

50:30.261 --> 50:31.827
<i> This is the third time.</i>

50:33.064 --> 50:36.966
And I wanted, like,
some fight or some contact.

50:37.035 --> 50:38.434
<i> I'm a demon.</i>

50:38.503 --> 50:40.069
<i> I'm on fire.</i>

50:40.138 --> 50:41.771
<i> I don't have a soul.</i>

50:41.839 --> 50:43.572
I'm already dead.

50:43.641 --> 50:45.975
So I don't
give a [bleep] anymore.

50:46.044 --> 50:47.643
<i> I'm gonna fight.</i>

50:47.712 --> 50:49.979
<i> I feel that I was born</i>
<i> for--for competing.</i>

50:50.048 --> 50:51.881
That's why I'm here.

50:51.949 --> 50:54.250
<i> - I've been waiting</i>
<i> for this moment.</i>

50:54.318 --> 50:56.886
<i> I understand why Logan</i>
<i> called me down.</i>

50:56.954 --> 50:58.020
He never wanted to do this.

50:58.089 --> 51:00.022
We are really good friends,

51:00.091 --> 51:03.959
but I think that was
a terrible mistake for him.

51:04.028 --> 51:08.431
I'm dancing, so jumping over
obstacles is my thing.

51:08.499 --> 51:11.100
<i> Hey, they don't want</i>
<i> to call the vampire down.</i>

51:11.169 --> 51:12.802
I got Romanian blood

51:12.870 --> 51:16.906
and you're all gonna see
what's a Romanian good at:

51:16.974 --> 51:18.474
everything.

51:23.381 --> 51:25.548
- Give us a show!

51:25.616 --> 51:27.450
- This is not about speed.

51:27.518 --> 51:30.252
15 seconds is
a long [bleep] time.

51:30.321 --> 51:32.154
Good luck, boys.

51:32.223 --> 51:34.657
Marathon, not a sprint.

51:36.194 --> 51:37.593
<i> - I would honestly say</i>

51:37.662 --> 51:41.597
<i> these are the two best</i>
<i> male rookies we've had</i>

51:41.666 --> 51:44.834
<i> and they're facing off</i>
<i> against each other.</i>

51:44.902 --> 51:46.969
It's literally
battle of the rookie.

51:47.038 --> 51:49.205
<i> Who wants male rookie</i>
<i> of the season?</i>

51:49.273 --> 51:51.340
Go on, guys, fight for it.

51:58.149 --> 52:00.983
- All right, agents, you ready?

52:01.052 --> 52:02.518
[airhorn blasts]

52:14.966 --> 52:18.634
<i> - Logan has a good endurance,</i>
<i> but I run</i>

52:18.703 --> 52:21.470
<i> and we have</i>
<i> to get this done fast.</i>

52:21.539 --> 52:23.272
I'm also fast.

52:23.341 --> 52:26.542
<i> You give me 15 seconds,</i>
<i> I only need five seconds.</i>

52:26.611 --> 52:28.310
- Let's go, Eman!
- That's good.

52:28.379 --> 52:30.646
- Good job.
- Go. [airhorn blasts]

52:33.718 --> 52:35.718
- Let's go, Eman, yeah!

52:35.786 --> 52:39.021
- Good pace, good pace.
Good job. Good job.

52:39.090 --> 52:41.790
Breathe, Eman, breathe.
You got this.

52:41.859 --> 52:43.192
- Yes!

52:43.261 --> 52:45.394
- Go. [airhorn blasts]

52:45.463 --> 52:47.997
- Go!
- Nice, there we go.

52:48.065 --> 52:49.298
- Great!

52:49.367 --> 52:54.670
- Good work. Good pace.
Good job. Okay.

52:54.739 --> 52:56.372
- This is gonna be
[bleep] hard, bro.

52:56.440 --> 52:58.407
- They'll be doing it
for a while.

52:58.476 --> 53:00.009
[airhorn blasts]

53:00.077 --> 53:01.810
- There you go. Nice and easy.

53:01.879 --> 53:04.513
<i> Logan's on my team,</i>
<i> and if I'm looking at</i>

53:04.582 --> 53:06.615
my chances of winning
this million dollars,

53:06.684 --> 53:08.017
I have to think about my team

53:08.085 --> 53:09.752
before I think about my crush.

53:09.820 --> 53:12.521
So I'm verbally
rooting for Logan

53:12.590 --> 53:14.523
but in my heart,
I'm rooting for Emanual.

53:14.592 --> 53:17.193
So it's a lose-lose.

53:17.261 --> 53:19.828
- You got this, Emanualito.
Vamonos.

53:19.897 --> 53:22.431
- Good job, Logan.
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

53:25.436 --> 53:26.802
[airhorn blasts]

53:33.110 --> 53:35.511
- Nice work.
This what you train for, baby.

53:35.580 --> 53:38.247
- We got round after round,

53:38.316 --> 53:40.416
<i> after horn blow,</i>
<i> after horn blow,</i>

53:40.484 --> 53:42.551
<i> after reset, after reset.</i>

53:42.620 --> 53:45.521
I mean, these guys
have got to be tired.

53:45.590 --> 53:47.223
Eventually one of these guys
is gonna break.

53:47.291 --> 53:48.490
- Thought it was
gonna be like speed.

53:48.559 --> 53:50.693
- Total endurance.
[airhorn blasts]

54:01.072 --> 54:03.138
<i> - My hamstring</i>
<i> now is feeling good</i>

54:03.207 --> 54:07.610
but running in sand and jumping
is not the best thing for this,

54:07.678 --> 54:11.847
<i> but I'm not gonna stop</i>
<i> until the leg breaks.</i>

54:11.916 --> 54:15.050
<i> So I'm gonna keep</i>
<i> running and running.</i>

54:18.322 --> 54:21.624
- Both of them, I think
could do this all [bleep] day.

54:21.692 --> 54:22.858
- All right, gentlemen.

54:22.927 --> 54:25.160
It's time to heat
things up a little bit.

54:25.229 --> 54:27.563
We're gonna bring this time
down to ten seconds.

54:27.632 --> 54:30.532
- Whoo! Ten seconds!
- Let's go!

54:30.601 --> 54:33.435
- Now you gotta move.
Now you gotta move!

54:33.504 --> 54:35.704
<i> - It's really important</i>
<i> for me to win this season.</i>

54:35.773 --> 54:37.339
I want to bring my mom home.

54:37.408 --> 54:38.974
<i> I just want to help her</i>

54:39.043 --> 54:42.144
and give her
the opportunity to do

54:42.213 --> 54:44.580
<i> and to feel everything</i>
<i> she never felt</i>

54:44.649 --> 54:46.615
because she had to take care
of me and my brother.

54:46.684 --> 54:49.084
<i> Mom, I love you.</i>
<i> You best, mama.</i>

54:51.656 --> 54:54.957
- 10 seconds, so speed it up.

54:59.230 --> 55:01.797
- Focus now.

55:01.866 --> 55:04.833
- Now it's a race, gentlemen.
Now it's a race.

55:04.902 --> 55:07.803
- Ready?
Go. [airhorn blasts]

55:07.872 --> 55:09.405
- Let's go. Let's go, Emanual!
- Go!

55:09.473 --> 55:11.607
- Go, go, go!
- Hurry!

55:13.477 --> 55:15.911
- Logan, Emanual, ready?

55:15.980 --> 55:17.646
Go. [airhorn blasts]

55:17.715 --> 55:18.947
- Let's go. Let's go, Emanual!
- Go!

55:20.217 --> 55:21.750
<i> - This elimination</i>
<i> is called Rocket Run.</i>

55:21.819 --> 55:23.986
They have to jump over
a missile, flip a lever,

55:24.055 --> 55:25.921
<i> jump back over the missile,</i>
<i> and flip the lever</i>

55:25.990 --> 55:27.823
<i> before the ten seconds is up.</i>

55:27.892 --> 55:29.558
I think it's definitely
gonna get more difficult,

55:29.627 --> 55:30.926
especially because
it was already

55:30.995 --> 55:32.027
coming down to the wire.

55:32.096 --> 55:34.530
Now they're really
gonna have to hustle.

55:38.836 --> 55:39.768
- There we go.
- Good job, Logan.

55:39.837 --> 55:41.403
Nice and easy, nice and easy.

55:41.472 --> 55:43.605
<i> Now it's a full-blown sprint</i>
<i> between the two guys,</i>

55:43.674 --> 55:46.342
but honestly,
Emanual's endurance is insane

55:46.410 --> 55:49.111
and you could just see every
time he hops over that rocket,

55:50.414 --> 55:51.814
he'<i> But Logan seems to be</i>et.
<i> having a little bit more</i>

55:51.882 --> 55:52.915
<i> of a difficult time with this.</i>

55:52.983 --> 55:54.783
- Go, go!

55:54.852 --> 55:56.185
- Ohm, boy, this is
gonna get spicy.

55:56.253 --> 55:58.354
- This is gonna get tasty.

55:59.190 --> 56:01.256
- You better pick it up, Eman.
[airhorn blasts]

56:01.325 --> 56:03.759
- Breathe, breathe.
- Your mama, Emanual.

56:03.828 --> 56:06.095
- Ten seconds, right? Okay.

56:06.163 --> 56:07.463
<i> You know what?</i>

56:07.531 --> 56:09.398
I feel like
this is better for me.

56:09.467 --> 56:11.567
<i> I've been preserving my energy</i>

56:11.635 --> 56:13.769
<i> and now I can go fast.</i>

56:16.173 --> 56:17.806
[airhorn blasts]

56:23.280 --> 56:27.950
- No mistakes, no mistakes.
- Four, three, two, one.

56:28.018 --> 56:31.420
- Emanual,
endurance is the best.

56:31.489 --> 56:32.521
Yeah, he's the best.

56:32.590 --> 56:34.356
His training
is so good in this.

56:34.425 --> 56:35.924
It's gonna be
a long night for me.

56:35.993 --> 56:40.462
But maybe I can win if
Emanual makes one mistake.

56:40.998 --> 56:42.498
[airhorn blasts]
- This is your game, Emanual.

56:42.566 --> 56:46.869
- This is you, Emanual.
You keep going.

56:46.937 --> 56:49.338
Come on, go!

56:49.407 --> 56:51.673
- One!
- Come on.

56:51.742 --> 56:53.976
[airhorn blasts]
- Getting close.

56:54.044 --> 56:56.645
Who wants it more?

56:56.714 --> 56:59.148
Make sure you get that damn--

57:02.453 --> 57:05.154
- Go!
- Go, go, Emanual!

57:05.222 --> 57:07.589
[airhorn blasts]

57:08.793 --> 57:11.560
- Emanual, let's go!

57:11.629 --> 57:15.330
Romanian does win,
mother[bleep]!

57:15.399 --> 57:17.032
I'm really happy for Emanual.

57:17.101 --> 57:18.534
<i> I think he's really proud</i>
<i> of himself.</i>

57:18.602 --> 57:19.835
<i> He should be.</i>

57:19.904 --> 57:22.171
And yeah,
let's go to the final, baby.

57:22.239 --> 57:24.807
- Let's go!

57:26.143 --> 57:28.610
- Congrats. Whoo!

57:30.581 --> 57:31.947
- Yeah!

57:32.016 --> 57:34.349
- Thank you.
- Good job, Logan.

57:34.418 --> 57:35.551
- Good job, Logan.

57:35.619 --> 57:37.352
- I'm so sad.
- No, it's okay.

57:37.421 --> 57:40.122
It's okay, man. Whoo.

57:41.258 --> 57:43.792
Maybe I have to train
a little bit more.

57:43.861 --> 57:46.795
I tried but I'm really happy

57:46.864 --> 57:48.564
for my friend, Emanual.

57:48.632 --> 57:53.068
I pick him
and this is what happened.

57:53.137 --> 57:54.870
I'm Logan Sampedro [indistinct]

57:54.939 --> 57:57.306
and you, for sure,
are gonna see me again.

57:57.374 --> 57:58.674
For sure.

57:58.742 --> 58:00.242
- I'm gonna drink
your blood now.

58:00.311 --> 58:02.744
[crunching noise]
- Ah!

58:02.813 --> 58:07.483
[both chuckle]

58:07.551 --> 58:09.384
- Yeah!

58:09.453 --> 58:11.820
<i> I'm feeling great,</i>
<i> but at the same time,</i>

58:11.889 --> 58:13.956
<i> I'm quite sad</i>
<i> because Logan is my friend.</i>

58:14.024 --> 58:18.060
I hate to say it but
I won, Logan!

58:18.128 --> 58:19.928
<i> To be honest,</i>
<i> I've been dreaming about</i>

58:19.997 --> 58:21.196
<i> going down in the Lair.</i>

58:21.265 --> 58:23.932
Eventually, I had to go
and look at me.

58:24.001 --> 58:26.201
<i> I only thought</i>
<i> about my family.</i>

58:26.270 --> 58:29.338
I was just running
and I could never stop.

58:29.406 --> 58:33.108
If I would stop, probably
I would have been dead.

58:33.177 --> 58:35.744
Like, death would be
the stop for me.

58:37.848 --> 58:39.515
- Well, Logan,

58:39.583 --> 58:41.083
you lost tonight's
elimination round,

58:41.151 --> 58:43.752
which means you are
deactivated immediately.

58:43.821 --> 58:45.754
But I'm sure we'll see you
in the future.

58:45.823 --> 58:47.256
Take care of yourself, man.

58:47.324 --> 58:49.992
- We love you, Logan.
- We love you, Logan!

58:50.060 --> 58:52.995
- Bye, Logan.
- This goodbye is a good one.

58:53.063 --> 58:55.130
- Thank you very much
to everyone.

58:55.199 --> 58:57.065
It was [bleep] nice
on the season.

58:57.134 --> 59:00.469
Ruby until [bleep] death.
- Love you, Logan!

59:00.538 --> 59:01.870
We love you, Logan.

59:01.939 --> 59:04.206
- Love you, Logs.
- You [bleep] get it.

59:04.275 --> 59:06.608
- Thank you, brother.

59:06.677 --> 59:08.810
- I didn't get the money.
[bleep] the money.

59:08.879 --> 59:13.649
But I get--I got friends,
I got experience,

59:13.717 --> 59:16.084
and that is
the best present for me.

59:16.153 --> 59:19.288
Congrats, my bro.
I'm really happy for you.

59:20.691 --> 59:22.190
- Congratulations, Emanual.

59:22.259 --> 59:23.392
Nice work.

59:23.460 --> 59:26.094
And now,

59:26.163 --> 59:29.031
by winning tonight's
elimination round,

59:29.099 --> 59:32.868
you are still in the game.
Go ahead and rejoin the group.

59:32.937 --> 59:34.636
- [gasps] Shut the [bleep] up.

59:34.705 --> 59:37.339
- Yep.

59:37.408 --> 59:40.709
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

59:40.778 --> 59:43.512
- Emanual. Emanual.

59:43.581 --> 59:45.647
- Join the rest of the group.

59:45.716 --> 59:47.149
- Whoo.

59:47.217 --> 59:48.917
- So right now,

59:48.986 --> 59:52.220
there are ten agents remaining.

59:52.289 --> 59:55.057
All of you are closer
to the final

59:55.125 --> 59:58.293
than you can ever imagine.

59:58.362 --> 1:00:00.929
However,

1:00:00.998 --> 1:00:06.335
we are standing in the Lair.

1:00:06.403 --> 1:00:10.172
What do we do in the Lair?

1:00:10.240 --> 1:00:12.407
- Eliminate.
- We eliminate people.

1:00:12.476 --> 1:00:15.611
<i> - What the hell?</i>
<i> What is going on here?</i>

1:00:15.679 --> 1:00:17.045
What have you got
planned for us?

1:00:17.114 --> 1:00:19.915
- So that is exactly what we
are gonna do.

1:00:19.984 --> 1:00:22.851
Right here, right now.

1:00:22.920 --> 1:00:26.521
This is the night
of elimination.

1:00:26.590 --> 1:00:30.158
<i> - What?</i>

1:00:30.227 --> 1:00:31.293
What?

1:00:31.362 --> 1:00:33.395
<i> Like right now?</i>

1:00:33.464 --> 1:00:35.864
TJ, right now?

1:00:35.933 --> 1:00:39.801
- And before we leave,
two more agents

1:00:39.870 --> 1:00:41.803
will be deactivated
and sent home.

1:00:41.872 --> 1:00:43.972
<i> - Super twist.</i>

1:00:44.041 --> 1:00:46.208
Stress is through the roof
right now.

1:00:48.078 --> 1:00:49.745
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:00:49.813 --> 1:00:51.747
I didn't go all this way

1:00:51.815 --> 1:00:53.515
<i> for you to change up</i>
<i> the game now.</i>

1:00:53.584 --> 1:00:55.384
Right before the final?

1:00:55.452 --> 1:00:58.186
Oh, my God.

1:01:02.926 --> 1:01:04.893
<i> - How many more things</i>

1:01:04.962 --> 1:01:08.196
do I need to do
to get to this final?

1:01:08.265 --> 1:01:09.398
I feel like I've done it all.

1:01:09.466 --> 1:01:11.767
I've played a perfect
political game.

1:01:11.835 --> 1:01:13.969
I've called the dogs off
of my allies.

1:01:14.038 --> 1:01:15.437
<i> I've won missions.</i>

1:01:15.506 --> 1:01:18.407
What else do I need to do, TJ?

1:01:28.285 --> 1:01:29.651
<i> - This is the night</i>
<i> of eliminations.</i>

1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:31.787
<i> Two more agents</i>
<i> will be sent home.</i>

1:01:31.855 --> 1:01:33.155
<i> - Everything's on the line.</i>

1:01:33.223 --> 1:01:36.124
<i> The best of the best</i>
<i> from the entire world.</i>

1:01:36.193 --> 1:01:37.793
<i> It's time to go to war.</i>

1:01:37.861 --> 1:01:40.429
<i> - All right, agents,</i>
<i> welcome to my final.</i>

1:01:40.497 --> 1:01:41.663
<i> - Go!</i>

1:01:41.732 --> 1:01:44.566
<i> - An epic test of your mind,</i>
<i> body, and heart.</i>

1:01:44.635 --> 1:01:47.035
<i> - Let's go!</i>
<i> - [screams]</i>
