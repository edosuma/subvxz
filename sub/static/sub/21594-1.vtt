Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:11.870 --> 01:13.836
<i>You might think life is easy</i>

01:13.838 --> 01:16.240
<i>for a cute little squirrel
with a fluffy tail,</i>

01:16.242 --> 01:17.573
<i>but it's not.</i>

01:17.575 --> 01:20.410
<i>Sure, when kids see you in
the park, they go, "Aww!"</i>

01:20.412 --> 01:22.279
Aww!

01:22.281 --> 01:24.781
- <i>If you're lucky, they give you nuts.</i>
- Huh.

01:24.783 --> 01:26.916
<i>If you're unlucky,
they</i> are <i>nuts.</i>

01:28.620 --> 01:31.288
<i>Being the little guy means
everything's out to get you.</i>

01:31.290 --> 01:32.488
<i>Bikes.</i>

01:33.792 --> 01:35.659
<i>Cars.</i>

01:35.661 --> 01:36.894
<i>Gum.</i>

01:36.896 --> 01:38.494
Ugh.

01:38.496 --> 01:39.763
Whoa!

01:39.765 --> 01:41.898
<i>But things got a whole
lot better last summer</i>

01:41.900 --> 01:43.866
<i>when the nut shop
went out of business</i>

01:43.868 --> 01:46.904
<i>and left a lifetime supply
of food in the basement.</i>

01:46.906 --> 01:48.672
<i>For once,</i>

01:48.674 --> 01:52.543
<i>the little guy at the bottom of
the food chain came out on top.</i>

01:56.649 --> 01:59.218
Cannonball!

02:03.621 --> 02:07.457
- You the man, Surly!
- Ha-ha! Thank you. Thank you.

02:07.459 --> 02:09.660
I call that one the Peanut Buster.

02:09.662 --> 02:11.294
Patent pending.

02:11.296 --> 02:13.930
Excellent. A very tight tuck.

02:13.932 --> 02:16.566
And a high degree of difficulty.

02:16.568 --> 02:18.435
Pfft. I prefer a cleaner entry.

02:18.437 --> 02:20.806
A little too much splash.

02:22.307 --> 02:24.774
Whoa! Nice. Ten.

02:24.776 --> 02:28.679
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
gotta get back to slacking off.

02:28.681 --> 02:31.280
Looking good, Surly!

02:31.282 --> 02:33.750
Hey, Bruce, remember to pace yourself.

02:33.752 --> 02:35.352
Why would I wanna do that?

02:35.354 --> 02:37.221
Playing with your food. Nice.

02:37.223 --> 02:38.822
- Look out!
- Whoa!

02:38.824 --> 02:41.391
Slow down or someone's gonna get hurt.

02:41.393 --> 02:43.427
That's the plan!

02:43.429 --> 02:45.830
Yee-ha!

02:48.734 --> 02:51.500
Precious. Come on, that's
disgusting. We talked about this.

02:51.502 --> 02:54.704
- No lick-licks.
- Uh, sorry, boss.

02:54.706 --> 02:57.673
It's hard to respect your personal
space when you taste like peanut butter.

02:57.675 --> 02:59.775
There's a peanut butter
machine right there.

02:59.777 --> 03:01.945
No way! Peanut butter!

03:01.947 --> 03:04.447
Come on. Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.

03:04.449 --> 03:06.750
What do you need shoes
for? You're a wild animal.

03:06.752 --> 03:09.252
Come on, snake eyes!

03:09.254 --> 03:12.724
One peanut colada coming right up.

03:13.025 --> 03:14.791
Keep 'em coming, Morty!

03:14.793 --> 03:18.461
All right, clear a path.
Mixed nuts coming through.

03:18.463 --> 03:21.597
Stuff your face until it's pink.
How many peanuts can you drink?

03:21.599 --> 03:25.702
Hot, fresh popcorn!

03:25.704 --> 03:27.937
The fun never stops
with the corn that pops!

03:27.939 --> 03:29.606
Popcorn here!

03:29.608 --> 03:32.078
Get your popcorn!

03:32.911 --> 03:36.147
No fair. Mine didn't pop.

03:38.751 --> 03:40.750
That was awesome!

03:42.888 --> 03:45.354
This is the life, Buddy, huh?

03:45.356 --> 03:47.990
Kickin' back. Literally doing nothing.

03:47.992 --> 03:51.197
Remember when we had to
work for these things?

03:57.402 --> 03:59.602
Come on, Dad. Hurry up.

03:59.604 --> 04:02.040
Careful, sweetheart. Not too fast.

04:05.044 --> 04:06.876
There it is.

04:06.878 --> 04:10.913
With a little hard work and
determination, that nut will be ours.

04:10.915 --> 04:12.882
Uh, Andie,

04:12.884 --> 04:16.053
why don't we just get free nuts
from the nut shop like everyone else?

04:16.055 --> 04:18.721
Does anybody else think that's a good idea?

04:18.723 --> 04:20.957
- Uh, yeah. I do. I do.
- Ooh, ooh! Ooh, ooh!

04:20.959 --> 04:23.627
No. It's a terrible idea.

04:23.629 --> 04:24.860
Ooh.

04:24.862 --> 04:27.464
Come on, guys. We're wild animals.

04:27.466 --> 04:29.666
Living off the nut shop is unnatural.

04:29.668 --> 04:32.635
But their products are a
hundred percent organic.

04:32.637 --> 04:35.940
Now, who thinks we should go get that nut?

04:38.810 --> 04:41.711
Guys, this is when you're
supposed to put your hands up.

04:41.713 --> 04:43.480
- Right!
- Okay!

04:43.482 --> 04:44.848
That's better.

04:44.850 --> 04:47.520
Now, pay attention because
this will be on the test.

04:52.524 --> 04:54.791
Remember, the nut is your friend.

04:54.793 --> 04:57.127
It's been waiting its whole life for this.

04:57.129 --> 05:01.367
Place your hands at ten
and two and gently pu...

05:02.134 --> 05:04.804
Gently pull.

05:06.805 --> 05:09.973
Uh, Andie, will this be on the test?

05:09.975 --> 05:13.810
Please hold all questions until
the end of the demonstration.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.414
- The nut shop's looking better and better.
- Mm-hmm.

05:22.454 --> 05:25.688
See, class? Hard work always pays off.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.130
Ooh!

05:34.833 --> 05:36.535
Ooh!

05:37.468 --> 05:40.036
See? That wasn't so bad.

05:40.038 --> 05:42.841
Now we can squirrel that
nut away for the winter.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.742
Who wants to go to the nut shop?

05:45.744 --> 05:46.942
Nut shop!

05:46.944 --> 05:49.048
Whoo-hoo!

05:51.583 --> 05:54.683
Johnny's got the early lead,
but Jimmy's close behind.

05:54.685 --> 05:57.053
Official eating contest
rules are in full effect.

05:57.055 --> 06:01.091
Any regurgitory reversals will
result in disqualification.

06:01.093 --> 06:03.295
Yay!

06:07.499 --> 06:08.664
Whoo-hoo!

06:08.666 --> 06:11.834
Here come peanuts!

06:11.836 --> 06:14.471
Attaboy, Johnny! Show
those nuts who's boss.

06:14.473 --> 06:15.805
Are you joking?

06:15.807 --> 06:17.574
An eating contest?

06:17.576 --> 06:19.009
What? It's good for morale.

06:19.011 --> 06:20.510
Surly.

06:20.512 --> 06:22.211
Hold that cranky response.

06:22.213 --> 06:24.250
I got you something.

06:26.218 --> 06:28.651
- A Brazil nut?
- Yeah.

06:28.653 --> 06:32.087
It's, uh, exotic. I, uh,
thought you might like, uh...

06:32.089 --> 06:34.591
That's really sweet.

06:34.593 --> 06:38.527
I... I can't believe you saved it for me.

06:38.529 --> 06:43.001
But, you know, I won't
take food from the nut shop.

06:44.903 --> 06:48.171
Well, that was supposed
to play out differently.

06:48.173 --> 06:51.908
Living off the nut shop was okay in the
beginning, but look at what it's become.

06:51.910 --> 06:53.844
And Jimmy tries to take the lead

06:53.846 --> 06:56.579
with his patented hammer-head technique.

06:56.581 --> 06:59.084
What a tremendous athlete!

07:00.052 --> 07:02.252
Ha-ha! Classic.

07:02.254 --> 07:04.855
This is not what animals do.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.257
We work hard. We store. We save.

07:07.259 --> 07:10.627
Look at all of you. Lazy and spoiled and...

07:10.629 --> 07:11.795
fat.

07:11.797 --> 07:13.796
Who you calling fat?

07:13.798 --> 07:15.233
Hmm.

07:15.867 --> 07:17.700
Come back to the park, Surly.

07:17.702 --> 07:19.569
It's where we belong.

07:28.514 --> 07:31.714
That's my favorite thing about being mayor.

07:33.785 --> 07:35.819
You get to sign your own permits.

07:35.821 --> 07:38.053
Hear! Hear!

07:38.055 --> 07:42.892
Every square inch of this
city is generating profits.

07:42.894 --> 07:45.562
How else could we skim enough off the top

07:45.564 --> 07:47.998
to build ourselves that
private golf course?

07:48.000 --> 07:49.832
Am I right, people?

07:49.834 --> 07:51.834
Fore!

07:51.836 --> 07:55.605
But I've got a thorn in my side.

07:55.607 --> 07:59.709
One part of this city
puts nothing in my pocket.

07:59.711 --> 08:01.545
Liberty Park.

08:01.547 --> 08:04.781
Nothing but grass and trees.

08:04.783 --> 08:10.120
Sittin' on premium city real
estate, generates zero profit.

08:10.122 --> 08:13.723
And I can't very well charge
children to climb trees now, can I?

08:13.725 --> 08:15.992
I'll look into it, sir. Dollar a climb?

08:15.994 --> 08:17.696
No need.

08:18.329 --> 08:20.863
I got bigger plans than trees.

08:25.336 --> 08:28.103
Andie, come back. Come on, what's with you?

08:28.105 --> 08:31.675
- Why are you so mad?
- The animals are losing their instincts.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.275
They're not gathering or
storing anything for winter,

08:34.278 --> 08:36.278
and they're not working together.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.013
Take it easy.

08:38.015 --> 08:39.682
That's all anybody does around here.

08:39.683 --> 08:42.051
Take it easy.

08:42.053 --> 08:43.919
<i>♪ For she's A jolly good eater ♪</i>

08:43.922 --> 08:45.754
What's wrong with easy?

08:45.756 --> 08:47.924
Easy doesn't build character.

08:47.926 --> 08:49.925
Easy doesn't last.

08:49.927 --> 08:51.026
That's ridiculous.

08:51.028 --> 08:52.628
Look at 'em.

08:52.630 --> 08:54.330
Working together, building character.

08:54.332 --> 08:56.766
Morale is at an all-time high.

08:56.768 --> 09:00.002
- You've got to get with the program, Andie.
- It's a house of cards, Surly,

09:00.004 --> 09:03.172
and it's only a matter of time
till it comes crashing down.

09:03.174 --> 09:07.009
Relax. It's not like the
nut shop's gonna explode.

09:07.011 --> 09:08.579
Aah!

09:12.951 --> 09:14.217
Oh, no.

09:14.219 --> 09:16.752
The peanut butter machine was in there.

09:16.754 --> 09:20.055
Oh, I can still taste you on my lips.

09:20.057 --> 09:21.824
No.

09:21.826 --> 09:23.394
Oh, dear.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.772
Mole, you had one job.

09:35.774 --> 09:37.306
What was that again?

09:37.308 --> 09:40.643
Shut off the boiler so it doesn't explode.

09:40.645 --> 09:43.747
It's not my fault. I told Jimmy to do it.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.214
I told Johnny to do it.

09:45.216 --> 09:46.782
I told Jamie to do it.

09:46.784 --> 09:48.318
And I told Mole to do it.

09:48.320 --> 09:50.820
Oh, right. It <i>is</i> my fault.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.432
What are we going to do, Surly?

10:03.434 --> 10:05.768
Yeah, what are we gonna do?

10:05.770 --> 10:07.804
Where are we gonna get food?

10:07.806 --> 10:10.073
It's okay.

10:10.075 --> 10:12.175
It's okay. We'll be fine.

10:12.177 --> 10:15.377
We'll just go back to scrounging
and gathering like nature intended.

10:15.379 --> 10:18.348
- This will be a good thing.
- What?

10:18.350 --> 10:20.949
You think the nut shop
blowing up is a good thing?

10:20.951 --> 10:22.719
Well, I got news for you.

10:22.721 --> 10:25.220
Nobody's gonna gather.
Nobody's gonna scrounge.

10:25.222 --> 10:29.258
Nobody's gonna break their back
collecting dirty old stale acorns.

10:29.260 --> 10:33.296
Sit down, put your feet up and
Surly will take care of everything.

10:33.298 --> 10:34.897
It's over, Surly.

10:34.899 --> 10:37.333
Things can't go back to the way they were.

10:37.335 --> 10:40.170
I'll find a new place, even
better than the nut shop.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.905
Like a nut market.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.406
Or a nut emporium.

10:43.408 --> 10:45.809
In fact, why limit ourselves to nuts?

10:45.811 --> 10:47.243
The city's got everything.

10:47.245 --> 10:50.946
Popcorn, doughnuts, hot dog on a stick.

10:50.948 --> 10:52.781
Hot dog on a stick?

10:52.783 --> 10:54.017
Yeah!

10:54.019 --> 10:55.451
I love hot dogs.

10:55.453 --> 10:57.020
I love sticks.

10:57.022 --> 10:58.988
What do you say, Buddy? You in?

10:58.990 --> 11:00.390
You can do it, Surly!

11:00.392 --> 11:03.059
Bring us back a smorgasbord!

11:03.061 --> 11:05.361
Hot dog on a stick! Hot dog on a stick!

11:05.363 --> 11:08.330
There are no shortcuts in life, Surly.

11:08.332 --> 11:10.065
Oh, really?

11:10.067 --> 11:13.605
Come on, Buddy. Let's take the shortcut.

11:18.777 --> 11:22.480
When we find food, Andie's
gonna be all like...

11:23.347 --> 11:26.749
"Oh, Surly, you were right all along

11:26.751 --> 11:29.219
and I was wrong all along."

11:29.221 --> 11:32.821
"Please, Andie, don't
beat yourself up about it."

11:32.823 --> 11:34.190
"Oh, Surly,

11:34.192 --> 11:36.459
you're so wise and forgiving

11:36.461 --> 11:39.027
and kind and nice and furry."

11:39.029 --> 11:40.863
"Shh.

11:40.865 --> 11:43.199
Don't worry, Andie. I forgive you."

11:43.201 --> 11:44.769
Huh?

11:47.505 --> 11:49.004
Jackpot.

11:49.006 --> 11:52.276
Or should I say... Le Jackpot.

11:53.177 --> 11:56.813
Oh, baby, you gotta
try this "es-car-got."

11:56.815 --> 11:59.148
Oh, that's good!

11:59.150 --> 12:00.783
- Aah!
- Aah!

12:00.785 --> 12:02.417
Move it, Buddy! Let's go!

12:02.419 --> 12:05.389
Get out of my restaurant,
you disgusting rodents!

12:08.058 --> 12:09.792
Jackpot.

12:09.794 --> 12:14.265
Salty, overpriced snack
food jackpot. Come on.

12:14.566 --> 12:16.232
Thank you, popcorn.

12:18.370 --> 12:21.036
Oh! Yes.

12:21.038 --> 12:22.975
Buddy, look. One left.

12:23.341 --> 12:25.543
Oh, come on!

12:27.077 --> 12:29.912
<i>All units, we have a
code seven in progress.</i>

12:29.914 --> 12:31.848
<i>That's half-priced
doughnuts, people.</i>

12:31.850 --> 12:35.050
- <i>Get moving.</i>
- Dibs on the jelly! Get in there! Get in there!

12:35.052 --> 12:39.522
Jackpot. Deep-fried, honey-glazed,
artery-clogging jackpot.

12:41.592 --> 12:44.262
You... Get back here!

12:53.205 --> 12:55.874
Not the doughnut. Not the doughnut.

13:00.445 --> 13:04.283
Wow. Those guys are
serious about doughnuts.

13:05.350 --> 13:08.184
Ah, let's face it. There's
no food for us out here.

13:08.186 --> 13:10.589
Let's go back to the park.

13:21.966 --> 13:23.432
This is our stop.

13:23.434 --> 13:26.169
Pay attention. Timing is everything.

13:26.171 --> 13:29.474
One, two, three.

13:33.010 --> 13:35.379
I forgot to account for the mailbox.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.651
Everyone is gonna expect us to have food.

13:41.653 --> 13:44.387
So we're gonna need to
let them down easy. Got it?

13:44.389 --> 13:46.792
All right, follow my lead.

13:51.897 --> 13:53.095
Look.

13:53.097 --> 13:54.564
- Hey, Surly's back.
- Huh?

13:54.566 --> 13:56.299
- Come on.
- Yay, Surly!

13:56.301 --> 13:58.267
- Surly!
- Surly!

13:58.269 --> 13:59.469
Did you find food?

13:59.471 --> 14:01.304
Uh...

14:01.306 --> 14:04.140
They found food!

14:04.142 --> 14:07.576
What Buddy means is we found
food, but it's complicated.

14:07.578 --> 14:09.780
Did you find popcorn?

14:10.014 --> 14:11.079
Buddy!

14:11.081 --> 14:12.581
Did you find doughnuts?

14:12.583 --> 14:14.651
Here's the thing.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.986
- How many doughnuts?
- Everybody, hold on.

14:16.988 --> 14:18.287
Eight doughnuts?

14:19.658 --> 14:22.094
There is no food!

14:24.296 --> 14:26.665
We're all gonna die!

14:29.333 --> 14:31.267
Everybody calm down.

14:31.269 --> 14:32.568
Calm down.

14:34.405 --> 14:36.039
Thank you.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.273
Come on, guys. Look around.

14:38.275 --> 14:41.143
We're the luckiest animals in the world.

14:41.145 --> 14:44.147
Our park has everything we need.

14:47.686 --> 14:50.719
<i>♪ This park's our home ♪</i>

14:50.721 --> 14:52.988
- What are you doing?
- Singing.

14:52.990 --> 14:54.589
It felt like the right thing to do.

14:54.591 --> 14:57.326
When's the last time you saw somebody
spontaneously break into song?

14:57.328 --> 14:59.329
Oh, come on, they were into it.

15:00.664 --> 15:02.598
It was a little awkward.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.334
You're not a great singer.

15:04.336 --> 15:06.536
Honestly, it was kind of pitchy.

15:06.538 --> 15:09.104
Geez. Tough crowd.

15:09.106 --> 15:13.010
We all love the park, but please,
please never do that again.

15:22.687 --> 15:24.353
One question! One question!

15:24.355 --> 15:28.324
Ladies and gentlemen of the
press, welcome to Liberty Park.

15:28.326 --> 15:32.996
I think we can all agree this boring
old park needs a shot in the arm.

15:32.998 --> 15:34.196
Behold!

15:34.198 --> 15:36.232
Libertyland!

15:36.234 --> 15:38.804
The greatest place on Earth!

15:39.770 --> 15:41.738
Who wants a regular park

15:41.740 --> 15:45.574
when you can have an amusement park?

15:45.576 --> 15:49.612
It's more fun, more rides, more games.

15:49.614 --> 15:52.415
And more profit.

15:52.417 --> 15:55.685
Libertyland is my greatest creation!

15:55.687 --> 15:59.488
You told me I was your greatest creation.

15:59.490 --> 16:01.656
No, no. Of course you are, sweetheart.

16:01.658 --> 16:05.328
Now, Libertyland is my
second greatest creation.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.497
No, no, no. This is all wrong.

16:07.499 --> 16:10.733
I want the Tilt-a-Whirl
here, bumper cars here

16:10.735 --> 16:15.371
and cotton candy here, here,
here, here, here and here!

16:15.373 --> 16:17.773
That's a lot of cotton candy now, snookums.

16:17.775 --> 16:19.642
We don't want your teeth to fall out.

16:19.644 --> 16:23.146
But I want it!

16:25.817 --> 16:28.217
Okay, she wants her teeth
to fall out. Let's do it.

16:28.219 --> 16:30.252
Can we get some more cotton
candy in here, please?

16:30.254 --> 16:32.354
- Yes, sir.
- Now!

16:32.356 --> 16:35.657
- This doesn't look good.
- Why don't you sing a song about it?

16:35.659 --> 16:38.326
Mr. Mayor, over here. Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor.

16:38.328 --> 16:40.629
What's going to happen to
the animals in the park?

16:40.631 --> 16:43.098
Ah. Nobody cares about these animals.

16:44.201 --> 16:46.835
Nobody cares more than me.

16:46.837 --> 16:49.671
But don't you worry. I
will take care of 'em.

16:49.673 --> 16:54.243
I will make sure they're all taken care of.

16:54.245 --> 16:59.084
And without further ado, let
the ground-breaking begin.

16:59.783 --> 17:01.349
Look at that sign.

17:01.351 --> 17:02.819
They're gonna destroy the park.

17:02.821 --> 17:05.320
We're all gonna die!

17:05.323 --> 17:08.290
Calm down. It's a fat
guy with a tiny shovel.

17:08.291 --> 17:10.160
How much damage can he do?

17:13.530 --> 17:15.097
Oh, I get it.

17:15.098 --> 17:17.166
The tiny shovel was a symbolic gesture.

17:17.669 --> 17:19.704
Oh, no!

17:20.105 --> 17:21.605
Run!

17:22.173 --> 17:25.175
Well, my work here is done.

17:26.478 --> 17:29.778
You see, sweetheart? I make
the speech, they do the work.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.314
Whew.

17:31.316 --> 17:32.817
Aah!

17:40.157 --> 17:42.557
Abandon park!

17:42.559 --> 17:44.494
Hey, where's everyone going?

17:44.496 --> 17:46.129
Wait up.

17:46.131 --> 17:48.430
Andie. Andie!

17:48.432 --> 17:51.534
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, slow
down. Who put you in charge?

17:51.536 --> 17:53.736
This isn't about who's in charge, Surly.

17:53.738 --> 17:55.403
It's about keeping us safe.

17:55.405 --> 17:58.141
Are you saying I can't keep us safe?

17:58.143 --> 18:00.910
You had your chance to take care
of the group and you blew it.

18:00.912 --> 18:03.746
Instead of doing what was
right, you did what was easy.

18:05.415 --> 18:07.249
Easy? Ha.

18:07.251 --> 18:10.553
Look at you. You're running away.
What could be easier than that?

18:10.555 --> 18:12.455
I'm sorry. What do you think we should do?

18:12.457 --> 18:14.593
We, uh...

18:14.791 --> 18:16.359
We fight.

18:16.361 --> 18:20.529
- Fight the humans?
- We're all gonna die!

18:20.531 --> 18:24.499
Tiny animals do not fight
humans with giant machines.

18:24.501 --> 18:27.202
If you wanna tuck tail and run, go ahead,

18:27.204 --> 18:28.804
but I'm staying here.

18:28.806 --> 18:31.340
This park belongs to us,

18:31.342 --> 18:33.575
and I think it's worth fighting for.

18:33.577 --> 18:35.844
Let's go get 'em. Who's with me?

18:35.846 --> 18:37.646
We're with you, Surly.

18:37.648 --> 18:39.248
Heck, yes, we are.

18:40.285 --> 18:41.584
Ha.

18:41.586 --> 18:43.818
Please, Surly, think
about what you're saying.

18:43.820 --> 18:46.957
- For the park!
- Whee!

18:51.328 --> 18:53.932
Let me show you guys how it's done.

18:59.470 --> 19:03.672
In the name of the park, I order
you to stop your vehicle and... Aah!

19:05.309 --> 19:08.643
So much for peaceful protest.

19:08.645 --> 19:11.950
Let's see you drive without this.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.334
Aah!

19:31.336 --> 19:32.735
Whoa! Surly!

19:32.737 --> 19:35.270
- That was awesome.
- You okay?

19:35.272 --> 19:36.805
I'm good.

19:36.807 --> 19:38.940
But you guys get the next one.

19:38.942 --> 19:42.344
So I told the foreman, "My head's
so thick I don't need a hard hat."

19:46.750 --> 19:48.817
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig.

19:54.325 --> 19:56.525
Hold on! I'll be done in a second! Whoa!

19:56.527 --> 19:58.395
Don't forget to flush.

19:59.830 --> 20:02.332
Let's trash this place.

20:05.036 --> 20:08.536
I'm defiling this thing.

20:08.538 --> 20:10.538
This is what I call a number three.

20:10.540 --> 20:13.909
Whoa, whoa! Hey!

20:13.911 --> 20:16.181
Look what I found. Hut, hut, hut!

20:19.317 --> 20:21.984
Whoa! It's good!

20:21.986 --> 20:24.355
I wonder what this thing does. Whoa! Whoa!

20:29.826 --> 20:31.861
You guys gotta try this thing.

20:31.863 --> 20:34.298
Trailer trash. Ah!

20:39.737 --> 20:43.038
Nobody cuts down a tree in my park.

20:43.040 --> 20:46.042
Fire!

20:46.044 --> 20:49.814
I may not be aerodynamic, but
I'm an excellent projectile.

20:51.782 --> 20:55.919
Ha! Now we both got a squished-in face.

20:56.753 --> 20:59.057
One left. You ready, Buddy?

20:59.891 --> 21:02.093
Go, go, go, go!

21:04.595 --> 21:06.828
No, no, no! No, no, no! Back in the hive!

21:06.830 --> 21:09.800
No! Not yet! Ouch! No! No!

21:11.935 --> 21:13.937
Huh? Aah!

21:20.711 --> 21:23.645
Aah! Aah!

21:26.416 --> 21:27.982
Nice work, Buddy.

21:27.984 --> 21:30.885
We took a lot of stings
for the team on that one.

21:30.887 --> 21:33.788
How did you not get stung?

21:33.790 --> 21:36.025
Aah!

21:36.027 --> 21:37.727
You better run.

21:37.729 --> 21:40.563
I'm off leash, on a rampage.

21:43.534 --> 21:45.934
Hello.

21:45.936 --> 21:47.769
Yep, this is he.

21:47.771 --> 21:49.904
Yes, I received your bribe.

21:49.906 --> 21:52.475
Oh, did I say "bribe"?

21:52.477 --> 21:55.143
Why, I meant "campaign contribution."

21:57.749 --> 22:00.151
- Gotta go.
- <i>No, no. Sir...</i>

22:00.651 --> 22:02.353
Come in!

22:02.819 --> 22:04.652
Um, M-Mr. Mayor?

22:04.654 --> 22:06.756
Well, look who it is.

22:06.758 --> 22:08.556
How nice of you

22:08.558 --> 22:10.926
to take time out of your busy day

22:10.928 --> 22:12.761
to come down here and let me know

22:12.763 --> 22:15.530
that construction is right on schedule.

22:15.532 --> 22:18.401
Actually, sir, that's not why I'm here.

22:18.403 --> 22:21.804
Well, then you must be here to tell
me that we're ahead of schedule.

22:21.806 --> 22:24.907
- Uh...
- 'Cause I know you ain't here to tell me

22:24.909 --> 22:26.941
that we have fallen behind.

22:26.943 --> 22:29.879
Sir, we were overrun by animals.

22:29.881 --> 22:32.148
They threw our potty in the river.

22:32.150 --> 22:38.687
Libertyland will proceed according to plan.

22:38.689 --> 22:43.194
Some mangy little rodents
think they can stop me?

22:43.795 --> 22:46.461
Well, I'll show them what happens

22:46.463 --> 22:49.498
when you mess with Percival J. Muldoon.

22:51.001 --> 22:53.602
Oh, yes, I will.

22:53.604 --> 22:56.307
Oh, yes, I will.

23:02.779 --> 23:04.447
Way to go, Surly!

23:04.449 --> 23:07.449
- You saved the park!
- You did it, Surly!

23:07.451 --> 23:11.886
Let's just say that bulldozer wrote
a check its scoop couldn't cash.

23:11.888 --> 23:15.024
Ah. Stop that. We talked about this.

23:15.026 --> 23:17.793
Oh, come on. We're celebrating.

23:17.795 --> 23:20.728
Fine. One more lick, then you're cut off.

23:20.730 --> 23:23.766
Ooh. Thanks, boss. I'm gonna make it count.

23:23.768 --> 23:25.633
Whoa, it's gonna be a good one.

23:25.635 --> 23:27.836
It's gonna be a good one!

23:27.838 --> 23:29.904
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

23:29.906 --> 23:31.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

23:33.211 --> 23:35.611
Wow. That was intense.

23:35.613 --> 23:37.912
Ooh, you taste good today.

23:37.914 --> 23:40.982
Stale acorns, with just
a hint of bulldozer.

23:40.984 --> 23:43.853
Way to go, everyone. We did it.

23:43.855 --> 23:47.989
I know everyone is hungry, so I
brought you all a little surprise.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.959
Ta-da! It's all the nuts
I was saving for winter.

23:50.961 --> 23:52.928
Ugh. Yech!

23:52.930 --> 23:55.631
Not exactly what I'd call "fine dining."

23:55.633 --> 23:57.766
Oh, come on, Surly. Have one.

23:57.768 --> 24:00.068
We're all in this together.

24:01.873 --> 24:05.009
Where'd you get this thing,
the bottom of a vacuum bag?

24:06.943 --> 24:08.943
Delicious!

24:10.647 --> 24:13.650
Whew. More like dust-licious.

24:14.719 --> 24:16.321
Hey, what the...

24:17.821 --> 24:21.657
See? There's life after the nut shop.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.160
Hmm.

24:25.162 --> 24:27.230
Oh, don't be like that.

24:43.647 --> 24:46.180
Hey. There you are.

24:46.182 --> 24:49.951
I never got a chance to
say you were amazing today.

24:49.953 --> 24:51.554
I'm always amazing.

24:51.556 --> 24:53.322
Today you just happened to notice.

24:53.324 --> 24:55.090
I'm serious.

24:55.092 --> 24:57.625
I didn't think we stood a
chance against those bulldozers,

24:57.627 --> 25:02.998
but when you pulled everyone
together, we were unstoppable.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.801
Well, don't get used to
it. It was a one-time thing.

25:05.803 --> 25:10.341
Today was a good day. Why are
you so intent on being grumpy?

25:10.740 --> 25:12.173
Are you happy it's gone?

25:12.175 --> 25:13.709
Surly...

25:13.711 --> 25:15.177
Answer the question.

25:15.179 --> 25:18.846
I'm glad we're all living
together in the park again.

25:18.848 --> 25:21.249
- Yes.
- Even if we starve?

25:21.251 --> 25:24.620
We're not gonna starve.
Quit being so dramatic.

25:24.622 --> 25:27.922
Animals did just fine
before there were nut shops.

25:27.924 --> 25:31.259
Well, sorry if I'm not as
excited about it as you are.

25:31.261 --> 25:32.894
It would be nice if you could be.

25:32.896 --> 25:34.162
- Excited?
- Yes.

25:34.164 --> 25:37.799
About scrounging for dusty old nuts? Ha.

25:37.801 --> 25:40.902
The animals look up to you,
Surly. You need to set an example.

25:40.904 --> 25:43.271
And what do you expect me to do?

25:43.273 --> 25:45.774
You could start by getting up at sunrise.

25:45.776 --> 25:47.809
Get a head start on the scrounging.

25:47.811 --> 25:49.644
The animals will wake up
and see you working hard

25:49.646 --> 25:52.347
and think, "I should work hard too."

25:52.349 --> 25:54.949
I'm gonna have to give that a hard pass.

25:54.951 --> 25:56.785
I'm sleeping in.

25:56.787 --> 26:00.055
Well, you know what they say.
"The early squirrel gets the nut."

26:00.057 --> 26:01.757
That's not even a thing.

26:01.759 --> 26:05.893
You just replaced "bird" with
"squirrel" and "worm" with "nut."

26:05.895 --> 26:08.331
Well, it doesn't make it any less true.

26:09.133 --> 26:10.668
Good night, Andie.

26:25.883 --> 26:27.749
Rise and shine, people.

26:27.751 --> 26:30.853
Today is going to be a great day.

26:30.855 --> 26:32.755
I think I'm having a nightmare.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.890
Up you get. Clap your hands.

26:34.892 --> 26:38.693
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

26:38.695 --> 26:40.996
What does that make yesterday?

26:42.365 --> 26:44.400
Hey, Precious, wake up.

26:44.402 --> 26:45.968
She's still sleeping.

26:45.970 --> 26:47.702
Aah!

26:47.704 --> 26:50.372
Aah!

26:50.374 --> 26:53.074
Hey, Andie. I'm starving.
What's for breakfast?

26:53.076 --> 26:54.142
Whatever you want.

26:56.212 --> 26:58.080
As long as you gather it yourself.

26:58.082 --> 27:00.114
Are you kidding me?

27:00.116 --> 27:03.017
Please, Andie, stop.
Quit while you're behind.

27:03.019 --> 27:05.054
Why lounge around

27:05.056 --> 27:09.224
when you can scrounge around
for some nuts on the ground?

27:09.226 --> 27:12.094
Take your rhymes somewhere else, sister.

27:12.096 --> 27:13.562
You're right. You should hang back.

27:13.564 --> 27:18.232
Wouldn't want everybody to see that
Surly Squirrel has lost his instincts.

27:18.234 --> 27:19.867
Hmph.

27:21.005 --> 27:23.207
Try and keep up.

27:33.451 --> 27:34.917
Nuts.

27:34.919 --> 27:36.919
That's strange. Where did those come from?

27:36.921 --> 27:39.153
<i>♪ Uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh ♪</i>

27:39.155 --> 27:41.757
<i>♪ Uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh, uh, uh ♪</i>

27:41.759 --> 27:44.826
No instincts, huh? How do you explain this?

27:44.828 --> 27:46.394
- Aah!
- Surly!

27:46.396 --> 27:48.396
Well, this is embarrassing.

27:48.398 --> 27:51.201
Surly's trapped. Come on.

27:51.469 --> 27:52.767
Pull!

27:52.769 --> 27:54.769
We're all gonna die!

27:54.771 --> 27:57.105
More specifically, you're gonna die.

27:57.107 --> 27:58.507
Way to keep it positive.

27:58.509 --> 28:00.007
Get me out of here!

28:00.009 --> 28:01.477
Pull!

28:03.079 --> 28:06.180
It won't open. It won't open!

28:06.182 --> 28:09.418
Mr. Mayor, you have called
the right man for the job.

28:09.420 --> 28:12.821
You'll be back to building
your amusement park in no time.

28:12.823 --> 28:14.222
Let me demonstrate.

28:14.224 --> 28:16.024
The little squirrel having a nice day.

28:16.026 --> 28:18.526
He sees a nut. "Hello there, nut."

28:18.528 --> 28:21.497
Cage closes. We drive him
to the forest, let him go.

28:21.499 --> 28:23.798
Good as new.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.801
I see. And this won't hurt the animals?

28:25.803 --> 28:29.036
Oh, no, Mr. Mayor. Humane traps only.

28:29.038 --> 28:30.873
Nobody's hurt. Everybody's happy.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.174
- Well, may I?
- Of course.

28:33.176 --> 28:35.076
I don't want humane.

28:35.078 --> 28:39.081
I want painful, gruesome termination!

28:39.083 --> 28:41.150
Mr. Mayor,

28:41.152 --> 28:44.853
that is a horrible and twisted
way to deal with the animals.

28:47.458 --> 28:49.557
- Daddy.
- Oh.

28:49.559 --> 28:52.527
I can help. I'm good at shooting
cute, little defenseless creatures.

28:52.529 --> 28:56.565
Oh, sweetheart, Daddy is so proud of you.

28:56.567 --> 28:58.400
Oh, look.

28:58.402 --> 29:00.201
We got one.

29:00.203 --> 29:02.504
Go get 'em, Frankie!

29:02.506 --> 29:05.340
Go, Frankie! Go!

29:05.342 --> 29:07.843
On three. Everyone, pull together.

29:07.845 --> 29:11.013
One, two, three!

29:13.817 --> 29:15.449
You okay?

29:15.451 --> 29:18.554
I'm fine. I-I'm fine.
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

29:18.556 --> 29:21.088
You had me worried there for a second.

29:21.090 --> 29:23.091
Wait. What's that sound?

29:23.093 --> 29:25.126
It's probably the little
paranoid voice in your head,

29:25.128 --> 29:27.028
screaming at the top of its lungs again.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.229
I'm serious.

29:28.231 --> 29:30.199
You certainly are.

29:30.201 --> 29:32.970
You know, you're not as
funny as you think you are.

29:36.140 --> 29:38.440
Dog! Run!

29:44.448 --> 29:46.180
Precious, help!

29:46.182 --> 29:48.385
Aah!

29:51.888 --> 29:54.055
Okay, someone's gonna pay for that.

29:54.057 --> 29:55.990
Whoa.

30:10.307 --> 30:12.207
Why is he looking at me like that?

30:12.209 --> 30:14.575
What a beauty.

30:14.577 --> 30:18.247
That smushed-in face. Those bulging eyes.

30:18.249 --> 30:21.449
She's like... an angel.

30:21.451 --> 30:23.451
Just go with it.

30:23.453 --> 30:26.020
What? No. Gross.

30:26.022 --> 30:30.026
You gotta go talk to him, or
that mutt is gonna rip us apart.

30:31.161 --> 30:33.527
Ohh!

30:33.529 --> 30:35.932
You owe me big time.

30:36.567 --> 30:39.567
Hey there, handsome.

30:39.569 --> 30:41.370
Hey there, precious.

30:41.372 --> 30:43.171
What? How do you know my name?

30:43.173 --> 30:45.106
What, your name is actually Precious?

30:45.108 --> 30:46.374
Whoa.

30:46.376 --> 30:49.210
My name's Frankie. It's long for "Frank."

30:49.212 --> 30:52.180
Hey, I just had the most
unbelievable thought.

30:52.182 --> 30:54.917
I'm Frankie. You're Precious.

30:54.919 --> 30:58.620
That makes us... Frecious.

30:58.622 --> 31:02.056
Keep him occupied. Try
using your feminine charm.

31:02.058 --> 31:04.058
This is my feminine charm.

31:05.663 --> 31:09.163
So, uh, tell me more about you.

31:09.165 --> 31:11.033
What do you do for fun?

31:11.035 --> 31:14.303
I would be more than happy to show you.

31:14.305 --> 31:16.371
Come here, you! Come back here!

31:16.373 --> 31:18.440
- Get going.
- I can't look away.

31:18.442 --> 31:20.942
This guy's dumber than a bowling
ball with a face painted on it.

31:20.944 --> 31:22.643
I'm gonna get you.

31:22.645 --> 31:25.479
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.

31:25.481 --> 31:27.114
Huh? Huh?

31:27.116 --> 31:28.449
Gotcha.

31:28.451 --> 31:30.384
Aah! Aah! Aah!

31:37.193 --> 31:39.661
Frankie's got a girlfriend!

31:39.663 --> 31:42.331
Daddy, I got a new dog!

31:42.333 --> 31:44.665
My little prince met a princess.

31:44.667 --> 31:47.201
- Surly!
- Precious!

31:47.203 --> 31:50.138
I'm coming for you,
Precious! Hang in there!

31:51.107 --> 31:53.107
Ha-ha! Come on, boys!

31:53.109 --> 31:55.110
Tonight we dine on squirrel!

31:55.112 --> 31:57.746
Aah!

31:57.748 --> 32:00.985
Aah!

32:02.152 --> 32:04.652
Over the... Guys in a...

32:04.654 --> 32:06.723
Slow down. What are you saying?

32:07.057 --> 32:08.190
Uh...

32:08.192 --> 32:10.525
We're all gonna die!

32:10.527 --> 32:13.362
Oh, no! Everybody scatter!

32:31.714 --> 32:33.149
My egg!

32:34.218 --> 32:37.318
No one's getting scrambled on my watch.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.620
Oh, thank you.

32:38.622 --> 32:41.057
Come on. Let's get out of here.

32:41.557 --> 32:44.459
Everybody out. We gotta go.

32:44.461 --> 32:46.797
Leave it. There's no time.

32:49.732 --> 32:52.734
Guys, wait up!

32:52.736 --> 32:55.636
Get back here, you chubby little beast!

32:55.638 --> 32:58.675
Come on, tiny legs. Go faster!

32:59.108 --> 33:02.913
This is so much fun! Ooh!

33:05.182 --> 33:06.782
Oh!
Ha-ha-ha!

33:08.152 --> 33:10.719
Ow! My fingers!

33:10.721 --> 33:12.586
And stay out!

33:12.588 --> 33:14.823
You're gonna pay for this.

33:14.825 --> 33:17.760
Fire in the hole.

33:18.729 --> 33:22.564
That's not good. Aah!

33:22.566 --> 33:23.968
Aah!

33:28.372 --> 33:30.671
Aah!

33:30.673 --> 33:32.076
Huh?

33:33.743 --> 33:36.846
Aah!

33:37.780 --> 33:41.149
I'd say we got him.

33:41.151 --> 33:42.952
Smile.

33:45.288 --> 33:48.256
You've completely destroyed this park.

33:48.258 --> 33:52.193
And I must say I am a fan of your work.

33:52.195 --> 33:55.798
All right, you layabouts, get moving.

34:02.205 --> 34:04.139
Buckle up, sweetheart.

34:04.141 --> 34:06.644
You know Daddy's got a lead foot.

34:09.179 --> 34:10.277
Precious!

34:10.280 --> 34:13.016
Surly!

34:13.449 --> 34:14.882
We gotta rescue Precious.

34:14.885 --> 34:17.518
It's my fault she was
taken by that crazy kid.

34:17.521 --> 34:19.554
You and Buddy go after Precious.

34:19.556 --> 34:21.655
I'll find us a new place to live.

34:21.657 --> 34:23.724
- What?
- Look around, Surly. It's over.

34:23.726 --> 34:25.726
We have to leave the park.

34:25.728 --> 34:28.862
- Where are we gonna go?
- There's another park on the other side of town.

34:28.864 --> 34:30.699
We'll check it out and report back.

34:30.701 --> 34:33.568
What about the rest of
us? What should we do?

34:33.570 --> 34:36.737
You have the most important
job of all, little guy.

34:36.739 --> 34:39.172
Try to not get killed.

34:39.175 --> 34:42.677
I'll try, but I can't make any promises.

34:42.679 --> 34:45.014
Okay, let's get moving.

34:45.181 --> 34:46.750
Hey.

34:47.717 --> 34:49.382
Be careful out there.

34:49.385 --> 34:52.221
Yeah. You too.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.164
Out of my way, riffraff!

35:02.166 --> 35:04.902
I don't have time for traffic.

35:06.570 --> 35:08.205
Aah!

35:10.641 --> 35:12.909
Whoa!

35:13.376 --> 35:14.909
Faster, Daddy! Go faster!

35:14.911 --> 35:16.443
Slow down!

35:16.445 --> 35:18.412
I know this relationship is moving fast,

35:18.414 --> 35:19.813
but when it's right, it's right.

35:19.815 --> 35:22.550
No. Slow down the car!

35:22.552 --> 35:24.654
Aah! Aah!

35:29.393 --> 35:30.925
I voted for you.

35:30.927 --> 35:33.728
Very nice to meet you.
Have a good day. Bye-bye.

35:33.730 --> 35:36.530
Aah! Whoa!

35:36.532 --> 35:38.067
Whoa!

35:38.702 --> 35:40.671
Ow! Come on, man!

35:45.509 --> 35:47.177
Aah!

35:54.684 --> 35:57.418
Silly doggy. Your new home is this way.

35:57.420 --> 35:58.586
Help!

35:58.588 --> 36:02.726
I'm not a rescue! I need to be rescued!

36:04.427 --> 36:06.360
Run, doggies! Run!

36:09.833 --> 36:11.633
Whoa! Ow!

36:11.635 --> 36:14.369
Whoa. Are you okay?

36:14.371 --> 36:15.970
Your owner is deranged.

36:15.972 --> 36:18.539
Yeah. She's got a screw
loose, that's for sure.

36:18.541 --> 36:20.809
Who wants to eat today?

36:20.811 --> 36:22.811
Oh, come on. She's gonna feed us.

36:22.813 --> 36:26.581
I make it a rule to never
take food from psychos.

36:26.583 --> 36:28.686
But I'm starving.

36:28.985 --> 36:30.985
Frankie, sit.

36:30.987 --> 36:33.287
Stand on your hind legs.

36:33.289 --> 36:35.523
Stand on one foot.

36:35.525 --> 36:37.559
What are you, a circus dog?

36:37.561 --> 36:40.262
I could be. You got a
thing for circus dogs?

36:40.264 --> 36:41.630
Play dead.

36:45.335 --> 36:47.969
You got me. Ooh! Ah!

36:47.971 --> 36:50.338
You got me.

36:50.340 --> 36:52.340
Man, that is dark.

36:52.342 --> 36:54.041
Good boy.

36:54.043 --> 36:57.912
Life is easy when you do
exactly what you're told.

36:57.914 --> 37:00.282
Now it's your turn.

37:00.284 --> 37:01.751
Roll over.

37:04.054 --> 37:06.789
I said roll over!

37:08.858 --> 37:10.691
What are you doing? Roll over.

37:10.693 --> 37:12.961
I don't know how. I'm
not classically trained.

37:12.963 --> 37:14.896
Oh, boy. This ain't gonna be good.

37:14.898 --> 37:17.798
Aah! You better learn to do some tricks

37:17.800 --> 37:20.367
or you're gonna be hungry.

37:25.442 --> 37:28.911
We've gotta find the mayor's
house and get Precious back.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.447
Who are you waving to?

37:32.014 --> 37:34.016
Oh.

37:35.619 --> 37:38.322
No time to make new friends, Buddy.

37:39.856 --> 37:42.493
Come on. This looks like a shortcut.

37:43.427 --> 37:45.229
Oh, don't tell me you're scared.

37:46.730 --> 37:49.898
Everyone knows there's nothing
safer than a dark alley.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.869
Come on. Aah!

37:54.036 --> 37:57.306
Just a... lovable little dolly.

38:01.043 --> 38:03.378
Well, that's shoddy workmanship.

38:03.380 --> 38:05.249
Aah!

38:08.452 --> 38:10.552
Dead end. Oh, no.

38:10.554 --> 38:12.487
This is bad.

38:12.489 --> 38:13.887
I'm too young to die.

38:13.889 --> 38:16.023
I'm too furry to die.

38:16.025 --> 38:18.025
It's been nice knowing you, Buddy.

38:27.838 --> 38:29.537
Oh. Whew.

38:29.539 --> 38:31.840
I thought we were in real
trouble there for a second.

38:31.842 --> 38:34.409
You scared us, you cute little guy.

38:34.411 --> 38:35.744
Boop.

38:35.746 --> 38:37.347
Aah!

38:39.416 --> 38:41.449
I shouldn't have booped
his cute little nose.

38:41.451 --> 38:43.584
Don't call me cute!

38:43.586 --> 38:45.855
The boop was too much.

38:47.556 --> 38:50.124
This is my city. You are on my turf.

38:50.126 --> 38:53.094
How can someone so cute be so violent?

38:53.096 --> 38:54.829
Ohh!

38:54.831 --> 38:57.831
I said don't call me cute!

38:57.833 --> 38:59.534
Got it.

38:59.536 --> 39:01.802
My name is Mr. Feng.

39:01.804 --> 39:04.539
I was cursed with these big adorable eyes

39:04.541 --> 39:06.641
and this fuzzy little body.

39:06.643 --> 39:08.142
But make no mistake.

39:08.144 --> 39:11.380
I'm a weapon of mouse destruction.

39:11.815 --> 39:13.447
Witness the power

39:13.449 --> 39:15.816
of my
1/16th-of-an-inch punch.

39:15.818 --> 39:18.221
Aw, that's cute.

39:20.123 --> 39:22.590
And painfully efficient.

39:22.592 --> 39:26.028
The city is no place for park animals.

39:27.731 --> 39:29.831
My army is unstoppable.

39:29.833 --> 39:31.833
Each mouse more deadly than the last.

39:33.737 --> 39:36.670
If you're telling me that the
first mouse is the least deadly,

39:36.672 --> 39:38.139
I'd like to speak with him.

39:38.141 --> 39:40.474
Any last words?

39:40.476 --> 39:42.744
Yeah. Just one.

39:42.746 --> 39:43.811
Cat!

39:43.813 --> 39:46.748
Aah!

39:46.750 --> 39:48.518
Come on, Buddy.

39:50.186 --> 39:53.086
There's no cat. Get them!

39:53.088 --> 39:55.592
You were right. No more dark alleys.

39:59.996 --> 40:01.965
Taxi!

40:03.166 --> 40:04.898
No! Buddy!

40:06.469 --> 40:09.170
- Run!
- Get the rat!

40:09.172 --> 40:11.104
Get me your hand, Buddy. I got you.

40:11.106 --> 40:13.076
Come on. Jump!

40:14.010 --> 40:15.345
Don't let go!

40:16.679 --> 40:20.014
If you ever come back to
the city, you are dead!

40:20.016 --> 40:23.050
See you later, you cutie patootie.

40:23.052 --> 40:25.655
Wow. That sounded tougher in my head.

40:27.791 --> 40:30.928
Hurry up. The new park
is right over that wall.

40:33.563 --> 40:35.063
What is taking them so long?

40:35.065 --> 40:37.065
Huh. Huh. Whoa.

40:37.067 --> 40:39.166
Huh. Huh. Whoa.

40:39.168 --> 40:41.836
Huh. Huh. Whoa.

40:41.838 --> 40:43.670
Huh. Huh. Whoa.

40:43.672 --> 40:45.639
Huh. Huh. Whoa.

40:45.641 --> 40:49.111
- Come on!
- We were just doing what the sign said.

40:54.550 --> 40:56.885
It's as pretty as a picture.

40:56.887 --> 40:59.720
A picture of a beautiful park.

40:59.722 --> 41:01.889
It's perfect.

41:01.891 --> 41:03.758
Yeah. You're right.

41:03.760 --> 41:05.159
It's not bad.

41:07.264 --> 41:08.963
Ohh!

41:08.965 --> 41:11.668
- Out of my way!
- No way! Me first!

41:12.869 --> 41:14.702
How good is this?

41:14.704 --> 41:16.237
And we've got the place to ourselves.

41:16.239 --> 41:18.139
Hello!

41:18.141 --> 41:19.874
Everyone's gonna love it.

41:19.876 --> 41:22.876
Mole can dig a new hole right over there.

41:22.878 --> 41:25.947
The chipmunks can live in
that beautiful old tree.

41:25.949 --> 41:30.083
Gradually hollowing it
out until it stops living.

41:30.085 --> 41:33.522
This park has everything we need.

41:34.190 --> 41:37.291
<i>♪ This park's our home... ♪</i>

41:43.567 --> 41:45.999
- What is it?
- Beats me.

41:46.001 --> 41:48.304
Looks delicious.

41:48.672 --> 41:50.671
It's stuck.

41:50.673 --> 41:51.773
Get it out!

41:51.775 --> 41:52.706
Get it out!

41:52.708 --> 41:54.075
At this point,

41:54.077 --> 41:56.344
I'm tempted to let natural
selection take its course.

41:56.346 --> 41:57.646
Get it out!

41:58.914 --> 42:03.019
- That thing stole my ball!
- You gotta play it as it lays.

42:05.221 --> 42:08.324
- Aah!
- That's a stroke.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.057
That's a stroke.

42:10.059 --> 42:11.693
I'm counting all these, Barry.

42:11.695 --> 42:13.827
Spit that thing out.

42:13.829 --> 42:17.134
- I'm trying. I'm trying.
- Look out!

42:18.702 --> 42:20.300
It came out.

42:20.302 --> 42:22.338
- Aah!
- Run that thing over!

42:23.106 --> 42:25.940
- Look out!
- Hey!

42:25.942 --> 42:27.874
Aah!

42:27.876 --> 42:31.079
Aah!

42:31.081 --> 42:34.617
Nice park, Andie. This place is great.

42:38.288 --> 42:41.525
Buddy, look. It's the mayor's car.

42:42.958 --> 42:45.827
Hang on, Precious. We're coming for you.

42:47.998 --> 42:51.068
Mailbox. Good lookin' out, Buddy.

42:56.739 --> 42:59.275
So many mailboxes.

43:18.027 --> 43:21.263
Come on down, Buddy. I gotcha.

43:22.364 --> 43:24.699
Were you aiming for my face?

43:24.701 --> 43:27.101
This is gonna be a stealth mission.

43:27.103 --> 43:30.838
So shh. Don't say a word.

43:30.840 --> 43:33.543
That shouldn't be a problem for you.

43:48.391 --> 43:50.293
Aah!

43:51.728 --> 43:53.864
Okay, that's a little creepy.

43:59.068 --> 44:01.436
Buddy, check this out.

44:11.380 --> 44:13.981
I call that one the Flying Squirrel.

44:13.983 --> 44:16.284
Ooh, I'm gonna kill you!

44:16.286 --> 44:18.786
You kept me on hold for 10 minutes!

44:18.788 --> 44:22.023
Anyhoo, the roller coaster
was delivered today.

44:22.025 --> 44:25.226
Got a great deal on a used
one that was condemned.

44:25.228 --> 44:27.195
Safety-schmafety.

44:27.197 --> 44:28.795
I want profitability.

44:33.902 --> 44:36.838
My name's Emma, and
this is my sister, Maddy.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.438
Can we come in and play?

44:38.440 --> 44:40.441
No way! You have no bodies.

44:40.443 --> 44:43.443
Our castle is for body people only.

44:43.445 --> 44:44.945
Fine.

44:44.947 --> 44:47.949
We'll use our piranha
teeth and chew our way in!

44:47.951 --> 44:49.816
Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh!

44:49.818 --> 44:52.420
And this is what they mean when they say,

44:52.422 --> 44:54.354
"There were warning signs."

44:54.356 --> 44:57.191
Yeah. You sleep better if you don't watch.

44:57.193 --> 44:59.526
Hey, what's wrong?

44:59.528 --> 45:01.862
- You're hungry, babe?
- Starving.

45:01.864 --> 45:03.898
She ever gonna feed me?

45:03.900 --> 45:07.400
Hard to say. But don't worry.
Frankie's got you covered.

45:10.405 --> 45:12.340
Dinner is served.

45:12.342 --> 45:17.144
You want me to eat your
barf? That is revolting.

45:17.146 --> 45:21.916
Revolting? No, girl. Regurgitation.
There's a big difference.

45:21.918 --> 45:24.985
Whatever it's called, it looks nasty. Hmm!

45:24.987 --> 45:28.356
Sorry, sweetie. I was just
trying to do somethin' nice.

45:28.358 --> 45:31.057
I didn't mean to gross you out or nothin'.

45:31.059 --> 45:32.994
Hmm. No sense letting this go to waste.

45:32.996 --> 45:35.796
Oh, no!

45:37.432 --> 45:40.267
Well, no sense letting that
go to waste either, right?

45:40.269 --> 45:43.037
It's amazing how quickly
rock bottom sneaks up on you.

45:43.039 --> 45:45.238
Psst! Precious!

45:45.240 --> 45:48.242
What are you, vegan? This has no taste.

45:48.244 --> 45:49.911
Hey, Frankie, what's that behind you?

45:49.913 --> 45:51.345
Huh!

45:51.347 --> 45:53.046
You want to see me catch it, don't you?

45:53.048 --> 45:55.115
Hey, get back here. Get back here, you.

45:55.117 --> 45:57.818
Help, help! They're eating everyone!

46:00.289 --> 46:02.824
I'm gonna get ya. Oh! Oh!

46:02.826 --> 46:05.025
- I'm gonna meet up with you. I'm gonna catch ya.
- Shh.

46:05.027 --> 46:08.563
I'm gonna catch ya. I'm gonna
catch ya. Come on. Get back here.

46:08.565 --> 46:11.298
Come on. Get back here.

46:11.300 --> 46:13.200
Get back here. Hey.

46:13.202 --> 46:16.237
Hey, what's goin' on?

46:16.239 --> 46:19.340
Sorry, Frankie. You're not really my type.

46:19.342 --> 46:21.474
I was just pretending to
like you to save my friends.

46:21.476 --> 46:24.077
Pretending?

46:24.079 --> 46:27.583
But together we're Frecious.

46:28.284 --> 46:29.416
Come on.

46:33.489 --> 46:35.923
Huh?

46:35.925 --> 46:37.557
Aah!

46:37.559 --> 46:38.925
Hop on!

46:38.927 --> 46:40.293
Come on! Move it!

46:40.295 --> 46:44.164
I'm a pug! I'm not built for
speed! Or power! Or looks!

46:46.068 --> 46:47.871
She's shooting at us!

46:51.139 --> 46:55.108
Giddyup. Yee-ha! Ride, ride, ride!

46:55.110 --> 46:56.978
Stop kicking me! I'm not a horse!

46:56.980 --> 47:00.180
Good idea, Buddy. Watch the rear.

47:00.182 --> 47:03.583
When I catch you, your
heads are going on the wall!

47:03.585 --> 47:05.219
I don't think that's an empty threat!

47:05.221 --> 47:07.188
Hang on!

47:07.190 --> 47:10.291
This is the worst rescue of all time!

47:10.293 --> 47:11.592
Daddy!

47:11.594 --> 47:15.229
What's all this ruckus? Hey, now!

47:17.300 --> 47:20.400
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Gotcha!

47:20.402 --> 47:22.570
Stop! Stop! Throw this puppy in reverse!

47:22.572 --> 47:25.075
Get back here!

47:26.275 --> 47:27.974
- Aah!
- Bottoms up!

47:27.976 --> 47:30.913
- Ohh!
- Yee-ha!

47:32.916 --> 47:35.383
Daddy, they're getting away!

47:35.385 --> 47:38.219
Hold up. There's something I gotta do.

47:38.221 --> 47:40.423
Come on! We gotta go!

47:41.056 --> 47:43.092
Buddy, you worry too much.

47:44.494 --> 47:47.128
Well, well, well. We meet again.

47:47.130 --> 47:48.561
Hyah!

47:49.965 --> 47:52.599
Little mayor!

47:52.601 --> 47:55.538
It's squirrel season.

47:56.005 --> 47:57.438
Whoa!

47:57.440 --> 47:59.307
Ha! Is that all you got?

47:59.309 --> 48:01.644
Buddy!

48:03.313 --> 48:04.577
Buddy, no!

48:04.579 --> 48:06.112
You got one!

48:06.114 --> 48:07.683
Buddy!

48:08.284 --> 48:10.019
No!

48:15.625 --> 48:17.860
And stay out!

48:32.474 --> 48:34.510
Andie.

48:35.177 --> 48:36.711
It's Buddy.

48:36.713 --> 48:38.481
Oh, no.

48:38.614 --> 48:40.180
What happened?

48:40.182 --> 48:42.182
He's hurt real bad.

48:42.184 --> 48:44.985
Here, let me help you.

48:44.987 --> 48:48.724
Oh, his chest is moving. That means he's
breathing. That's gotta be good, right?

48:58.768 --> 49:03.807
It's all my fault. If I hadn't been
so reckless, he'd still be okay.

49:10.246 --> 49:13.313
Let me get this straight.
Liberty Park is destroyed,

49:13.315 --> 49:16.483
the backup park was a bust
and now Buddy's hurt too?

49:16.485 --> 49:18.753
Yes, yes and yes.

49:18.755 --> 49:21.054
Wow, I'm never right.

49:21.056 --> 49:24.760
Now it happens three times in a
row, and I'm not even happy about it.

49:26.128 --> 49:29.396
Hey, Buddy, remember when we...
we hid in that jack o' lantern

49:29.398 --> 49:31.731
so we could steal Halloween
candy from the trick-or-treaters?

49:33.302 --> 49:36.436
I didn't notice the candle
and my tail caught on fire.

49:36.438 --> 49:39.407
Meanwhile, you got away
with two bags of candy.

49:41.043 --> 49:43.644
Or that time we mailed
ourselves to the peanut factory.

49:43.646 --> 49:45.479
You got there fine.

49:45.481 --> 49:47.414
I got flagged as a suspicious package

49:47.416 --> 49:50.251
and spent two weeks at the FBI.

49:50.253 --> 49:52.619
It should have been me
who fell off that ledge.

49:52.621 --> 49:56.791
You're the lucky one. You're
the one who always ends up okay.

49:56.793 --> 50:00.028
- Hey, you need a break.
- I'm fine.

50:04.699 --> 50:07.168
Tell me about Buddy.

50:07.170 --> 50:09.806
How did you guys get to be so close?

50:11.139 --> 50:13.340
I've known Buddy forever.

50:13.342 --> 50:15.342
Met him the year of the hurricane.

50:15.344 --> 50:17.711
The sky was a terrible color.

50:17.713 --> 50:19.746
Never seen anything like it.

50:26.456 --> 50:30.257
Surly!

50:30.259 --> 50:32.161
Surly!

50:38.333 --> 50:42.735
- Wow! That sure is a howler! Bad as I've ever seen!
- Oh, totally.

50:42.737 --> 50:45.840
<i>Then I saw him, the
tiniest little rat.</i>

50:45.842 --> 50:48.409
<i>He couldn't have been
more than a few weeks old.</i>

50:48.411 --> 50:51.512
Oh, no! We have to help him!

50:51.514 --> 50:54.447
It's too late! There's nothing we can do!

50:54.449 --> 50:57.150
- No!
- Seal the door!

50:57.152 --> 51:00.622
Wait! Ohh! I'm coming
for you, little buddy!

51:02.324 --> 51:04.660
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

51:09.132 --> 51:12.135
Little guy! Little buddy!

51:17.405 --> 51:19.641
Aah!

51:20.242 --> 51:21.945
Hang on!

51:22.577 --> 51:24.112
Hang on!

51:26.349 --> 51:28.051
You got it? You got it?

51:29.184 --> 51:30.753
Get down!

51:31.920 --> 51:34.056
<i>That's when I blacked out.</i>

51:34.724 --> 51:37.894
<i>I have no idea how he kept me alive.</i>

51:40.596 --> 51:43.132
<i>He never spoke a word about it.</i>

51:43.766 --> 51:46.034
<i>Or anything else.</i>

51:50.438 --> 51:53.206
When I woke up, he was there,

51:53.208 --> 51:55.775
and he hasn't left my side ever since.

51:55.777 --> 52:00.380
Can you believe this
goofball saved my life?

52:00.382 --> 52:02.818
Sounds like you saved each other.

52:17.333 --> 52:20.434
Bring it down nice and easy.

52:20.436 --> 52:22.905
Okay, that's good.

52:24.974 --> 52:26.639
Library Land?

52:26.641 --> 52:28.675
Oh. That doesn't sound fun at all.

52:28.677 --> 52:31.845
It says "Libertyland," you moron.

52:31.847 --> 52:35.481
- You should have gone to Library Land when you was a kid.
- Ooh!

52:35.483 --> 52:38.818
Tell your crew of illiterate
layabouts to hurry up!

52:38.820 --> 52:42.655
Mr. Mayor, if we go any faster, we're
going to have to start cutting corners.

52:42.657 --> 52:45.291
So cut 'em. I never liked corners.

52:45.293 --> 52:48.829
I prefer rounded shapes myself.

52:48.831 --> 52:51.798
And look at this ride.
Those are office chairs.

52:51.800 --> 52:54.836
Kids love office chairs.

52:56.739 --> 52:58.472
What if somebody gets hurt?

52:58.474 --> 53:00.840
That is an excellent point.

53:00.842 --> 53:06.648
I'm going to need you to make a sign with
large red letters that says, "No refunds!"

53:10.018 --> 53:12.254
We've got to do something.

53:12.887 --> 53:15.722
So do something.

53:15.724 --> 53:18.325
We need you to come up with a plan.

53:18.327 --> 53:21.996
Your plan is for me to come up with
a plan? Oh, that's a great plan.

53:21.998 --> 53:25.633
News flash, Andie. My
crazy plans don't work.

53:25.635 --> 53:27.870
Look what happened to Buddy.

53:29.938 --> 53:31.505
Look at them, Surly.

53:31.507 --> 53:33.673
They've lost the nut shop.
They've lost the park.

53:33.675 --> 53:36.644
There's nothing to eat,
but they're still here.

53:36.646 --> 53:38.945
Why do you think that is?

53:38.947 --> 53:41.315
'Cause there's nowhere left to go.

53:41.317 --> 53:43.416
They're here because of you.

53:43.418 --> 53:45.485
They need something to believe in.

53:45.487 --> 53:47.989
<i>I</i> need something to believe in.

53:49.291 --> 53:52.894
What happens if he doesn't
wake up, Andie? Then what?

53:55.530 --> 54:00.168
Hey, Buddy. I never got a chance
to say thanks for breaking me out.

54:01.603 --> 54:03.771
Leave him alone.

54:03.773 --> 54:06.342
I was just tryin' to say thanks.

54:06.775 --> 54:09.444
Did... Did he just move?

54:10.445 --> 54:12.545
Come on, Buddy. Wake up.

54:12.547 --> 54:15.048
- Come back to me, Buddy!
- Surly.

54:15.050 --> 54:16.450
- Lick him again!
- But...

54:16.452 --> 54:17.751
- Do it!
- But you just said...

54:17.753 --> 54:20.021
Who cares what I said. Just do it!

54:23.925 --> 54:26.461
Come on. Come on.

54:30.065 --> 54:32.032
Ha, ha! I knew it!

54:32.034 --> 54:36.003
Even in a coma, nobody can stand
to have dog slobber on their face.

54:36.005 --> 54:37.604
Hey, I resent that.

54:37.606 --> 54:39.106
I've seen the places you lick.

54:39.108 --> 54:40.641
Oh, touché.

54:40.643 --> 54:43.478
Now hit him with everything you got.

54:54.356 --> 54:56.423
Buddy.

54:56.425 --> 54:57.891
I thought I lost you.

54:59.728 --> 55:01.729
My licks are magical!

55:01.731 --> 55:03.496
Hey, anybody else need one?

55:03.498 --> 55:04.932
No, we're good.

55:04.934 --> 55:07.034
I'm so sorry, Buddy.

55:07.036 --> 55:10.239
I promise I'll never do
anything reckless again.

55:12.407 --> 55:14.874
Don't turn over a new leaf just yet.

55:14.876 --> 55:17.543
We still need to save the park.

55:17.545 --> 55:21.815
What do you expect me to do? Lead us into
battle against the mayor and his goons?

55:21.817 --> 55:26.289
Destroy all the rides and take back
Liberty Park by force? I mean, come on...

55:31.626 --> 55:32.959
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:32.961 --> 55:35.130
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

55:36.798 --> 55:39.532
Geez, guys, that's kind of lot of pressure.

55:39.534 --> 55:42.304
You can do it, boss. It's all you.

55:43.172 --> 55:46.139
No. It's not <i>all</i> me.

55:46.141 --> 55:50.510
If we wanna stop these guys,
it's gonna take everyone.

55:50.512 --> 55:52.813
Gather round. Let's make a plan.

55:55.851 --> 55:58.418
Thank you. Thank you.

55:58.420 --> 56:00.586
Thank you all for coming.

56:00.588 --> 56:04.057
What are you waiting for? Take my picture!

56:04.059 --> 56:06.092
Oh, that kid's a monster.

56:06.094 --> 56:07.860
Her and her dog both.

56:07.862 --> 56:09.762
Hey, Frankie's nothing like her.

56:09.764 --> 56:11.697
You've got no idea what he's been through.

56:11.699 --> 56:13.566
Come on, Frankie. Move it!

56:13.568 --> 56:16.003
Mr. Mayor, what do you say to allegations

56:16.005 --> 56:19.139
that this amusement park is
an environmental catastrophe?

56:19.141 --> 56:22.675
Well, I, uh... I, um...

56:24.079 --> 56:28.050
No questions? All right,
well, then hit the switch.

56:30.820 --> 56:32.586
"Lie Land"?

56:32.588 --> 56:34.755
I-I'll get that fixed right away.

56:34.757 --> 56:38.492
Nah, don't bother. No sense in
running up the electric bill.

56:38.494 --> 56:39.760
- Mr. Mayor!
- Mr. Mayor!

56:39.762 --> 56:41.628
Hey, what's going on?

56:41.630 --> 56:47.066
Now, now, tonight is an exclusive
event for my campaign contributors.

56:47.068 --> 56:51.137
You will be more than welcome to
buy your very own full-priced tickets

56:51.139 --> 56:53.539
when it opens to the public.

56:53.541 --> 56:54.974
Perfect timing.

56:54.976 --> 56:57.445
Launch the aerial campaign!

57:00.081 --> 57:01.849
Aah! My eyes!

57:01.851 --> 57:04.083
That's the sign! That's the sign!

57:09.724 --> 57:12.592
- Remember your training!
- You had training?

57:12.594 --> 57:14.262
Waah!

57:15.931 --> 57:17.597
Whoo-hoo!

57:17.599 --> 57:20.001
I'm good to go! I'm good to go!

57:20.802 --> 57:22.404
Aah!

57:24.139 --> 57:27.007
I'm flyin'! I'm flyin'!

57:27.009 --> 57:29.108
Ooof!

57:48.664 --> 57:50.664
Time to eat my vegetables.

57:50.666 --> 57:52.900
And by vegetables, I mean ketchup.

57:52.902 --> 57:54.034
Huh?

57:54.036 --> 57:56.302
Yahoo!

57:56.304 --> 57:58.871
Yeah.

57:58.873 --> 58:03.346
- White tuxedo.
- Target acquired.

58:08.650 --> 58:11.586
When that clock hits 9:00, we attack.

58:14.556 --> 58:17.090
That clock hasn't worked in 30 years.

58:17.092 --> 58:19.760
What? Ahh! All right, fine.

58:19.762 --> 58:22.731
Everyone go! Just forget
the clock! Just go!

58:24.800 --> 58:28.001
Ahh! My white tuxedo!

58:33.641 --> 58:35.543
Dive! Dive! Dive!

58:36.210 --> 58:38.945
Get 'em! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

58:42.585 --> 58:45.318
Stop pecking me! Stop!

58:50.759 --> 58:52.159
Ohh! Aah!

58:52.161 --> 58:54.695
Drink up! Drink up!

58:57.099 --> 58:59.166
Get it! Whack that mole!

58:59.168 --> 59:01.200
Whack-a-mole? How
do you like it?

59:01.202 --> 59:02.970
How do you like it?

59:02.972 --> 59:04.637
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

59:04.639 --> 59:07.475
The very existence of this game offends me.

59:09.311 --> 59:12.213
Nice chewing, guys!

59:22.123 --> 59:26.293
I want that squirrel's
head deep-fried on a stick!

59:40.342 --> 59:41.907
- What are you doing?
- What?

59:41.909 --> 59:44.110
Nobody likes a parking hog.

59:44.112 --> 59:46.648
Ugh. Fine.

59:56.090 --> 59:59.693
Move it! Move it! Go! Go! Go! Go!

59:59.695 --> 01:00:01.994
Aah!

01:00:01.996 --> 01:00:05.331
Dad!

01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:07.435
Spread out! Spread out, boys!

01:00:08.302 --> 01:00:11.771
Come out, come out wherever you are!

01:00:11.773 --> 01:00:14.206
Yeah. We're not gonna hurt you.

01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:15.842
Punch it!

01:00:15.844 --> 01:00:17.711
- Aha!
- Whoo!

01:00:17.713 --> 01:00:19.345
It's Groundhog Day!

01:00:19.347 --> 01:00:21.248
You are a terrible driver!

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.383
What do you expect? I'm a groundhog!

01:00:23.385 --> 01:00:26.322
I need backup! I need backup!

01:00:28.056 --> 01:00:31.726
- Ha, ha! I got him!
- Watch the road! Watch the road!

01:00:33.394 --> 01:00:34.795
Ohh!

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:36.262
- What the...
- Let me go!

01:00:36.264 --> 01:00:38.898
Got 'em. Six more weeks of winter.

01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.001
Yeah, that's a groundhog joke.

01:00:42.471 --> 01:00:45.938
Whoa! Ohh! Everybody take cover!

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.108
Come here, fuzzy little guys!

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:50.312
Where do you think you're going?

01:00:51.313 --> 01:00:53.813
Buddy, stay behind me!

01:00:53.815 --> 01:00:56.083
- Surly!
- Precious, look out!

01:00:56.085 --> 01:00:57.918
No, let me go, you...

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.452
Precious!

01:00:59.454 --> 01:01:01.257
No! Buddy!

01:01:05.893 --> 01:01:07.494
No! Buddy!

01:01:07.496 --> 01:01:09.898
Ah, got ya, you little critter.

01:01:17.005 --> 01:01:18.874
Okay, boys.

01:01:19.407 --> 01:01:21.407
Andie!

01:01:21.409 --> 01:01:23.745
Andie, up here!

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.786
Surly, they've got everyone.
The groundhogs, Mole, even Buddy.

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:34.820
- We can't win this thing.
- Sure, we can.

01:01:34.822 --> 01:01:38.791
No, Andie, we can't.
Not with only two of us.

01:01:38.793 --> 01:01:41.829
But... we have to try.

01:01:43.465 --> 01:01:45.367
Save yourself.

01:01:45.967 --> 01:01:47.200
Surly, stop!

01:01:47.202 --> 01:01:49.802
Find somewhere to hide!

01:01:49.804 --> 01:01:51.639
Surly!

01:01:57.445 --> 01:02:00.813
That's all of them, Mr. Mayor.

01:02:00.815 --> 01:02:04.818
Ladies and gentlemen, get back
out there and have a good time.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:09.758
I assure you that our little
rodent problem has been solved.

01:02:30.112 --> 01:02:32.378
Aah!

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.115
I know you're out there! Come and get me!

01:02:41.523 --> 01:02:45.291
Mr. Feng will be happy to see you.

01:02:45.293 --> 01:02:47.429
Aah!

01:02:48.063 --> 01:02:49.996
Get going! Move it!

01:02:49.998 --> 01:02:53.302
You were a lot cuter
before you had a weapon.

01:02:54.369 --> 01:02:56.970
You're a long way from
the park, little squirrel.

01:02:56.972 --> 01:02:59.206
Yeah, you're in the city now.

01:03:01.009 --> 01:03:02.577
Aah!

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:24.400
Ohh! Ahh! Ow! Ooh! Ohh!

01:03:42.317 --> 01:03:44.483
I told you to stay out of the city.

01:03:44.485 --> 01:03:46.353
You didn't listen.

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:48.287
Now you gonna pay.

01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:50.055
I came to talk to you.

01:03:50.057 --> 01:03:52.525
- Get rid of him.
- What's the problem?

01:03:52.527 --> 01:03:55.528
You too cute to face me yourself?

01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:56.929
Cute!

01:04:02.271 --> 01:04:04.037
Never call me cute!

01:04:04.039 --> 01:04:06.305
Yeah, yeah. Never call
you cute. I heard you.

01:04:06.307 --> 01:04:08.374
But guess what. You are cute.

01:04:08.376 --> 01:04:11.110
And no matter how many
times you kick me... Ohh!

01:04:11.112 --> 01:04:12.945
Or punch me... Ohh!

01:04:12.947 --> 01:04:16.115
It's not gonna change
the fact that you're cute.

01:04:16.117 --> 01:04:18.952
You're an animal, and all animals are cute.

01:04:18.954 --> 01:04:21.688
Well, with the exception of the
platypus. Those things are rough.

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:24.291
Why are you here?

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:26.659
I need your help to take back the park.

01:04:26.661 --> 01:04:30.362
I don't care about your park.
I used to live in a park.

01:04:30.364 --> 01:04:32.164
We all did.

01:04:32.166 --> 01:04:36.670
<i>We were peaceful and happy,
but people called us vermin.</i>

01:04:36.672 --> 01:04:41.141
<i>They forced us out and turned
our home into a golf course.</i>

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:43.075
<i>We hid in the city</i>

01:04:43.077 --> 01:04:46.378
<i>and vowed to transform
from cute and peaceful</i>

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:50.050
<i>to armed and dangerous.</i>

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:54.253
<i>We trained with the kung fu
masters of the Shaolin temple.</i>

01:04:54.255 --> 01:04:59.358
<i>We grew strong and made sure our
home would never be in danger again.</i>

01:05:01.028 --> 01:05:04.465
Now I'm a city mouse, and I hate parks.

01:05:08.436 --> 01:05:11.704
There's no such thing as a
city mouse or a park mouse.

01:05:11.706 --> 01:05:15.175
We're all animals, and we need
to look out for each other.

01:05:19.313 --> 01:05:22.983
Don't you see? They're doing the
same thing to us that they did to you.

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:25.217
This is your chance to do the right thing.

01:05:25.219 --> 01:05:28.655
Enough!

01:05:28.657 --> 01:05:30.590
You might as well do it,

01:05:30.592 --> 01:05:33.325
because if you don't
help me save my friends,

01:05:33.327 --> 01:05:35.630
I got nothing to live for.

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:43.670
Mm.

01:05:43.672 --> 01:05:45.637
- Andie.
- She's awake.

01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:48.877
Mm.

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:51.244
Is everyone here?

01:05:51.246 --> 01:05:53.412
Everyone but Surly.

01:05:53.414 --> 01:05:55.347
What happened to Surly?

01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:58.886
He's probably got those animal control
creeps right where he wants them.

01:06:00.088 --> 01:06:04.626
You're not gonna like where you're going.

01:06:06.795 --> 01:06:09.695
What's going on? Where are they taking us?

01:06:09.697 --> 01:06:14.101
We're all gonna die. Definitely gonna die.

01:06:17.304 --> 01:06:18.704
Stop!

01:06:18.706 --> 01:06:21.742
Hello, roadkill.

01:06:23.378 --> 01:06:26.648
- Now!
- Charge!

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:41.061
Surly?

01:06:41.063 --> 01:06:42.795
Before you get mad, just remember,

01:06:42.797 --> 01:06:44.932
you're the one who wanted a crazy plan.

01:06:45.766 --> 01:06:48.803
I'd like to you to meet
my new friend, Mr. Feng.

01:06:50.105 --> 01:06:52.304
Oh, he's so cute!

01:06:54.608 --> 01:06:57.142
That reminds me. Don't call him cute.

01:06:57.144 --> 01:07:00.079
How did you convince a gang
of city mice to come help us?

01:07:00.081 --> 01:07:04.184
We are not city mice. We are just mice.

01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:08.655
A long time ago, Mr. Feng and his friends
were chased out of their homes too.

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:13.562
Nobody was there to stand up
for us, and we lost everything.

01:07:14.195 --> 01:07:16.128
But Surly is right.

01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:20.499
We are all animals, and
we are in this together.

01:07:20.501 --> 01:07:24.840
Individually, we might be
tiny, but together we're giants.

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.273
- For the park!
- For the park!

01:07:36.885 --> 01:07:39.251
Hey, how's it going?

01:07:39.253 --> 01:07:42.557
There's so many of them!

01:07:48.396 --> 01:07:51.867
Lift!

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.202
Wow! That was close.

01:07:55.769 --> 01:07:58.306
Dig, dig, dig, dig. Run!

01:08:01.342 --> 01:08:03.443
All right, Buddy, let her rip!

01:08:06.213 --> 01:08:08.882
Yeah, Buddy!

01:08:08.884 --> 01:08:10.483
That is what I'm talking about.

01:08:10.485 --> 01:08:13.789
Hey, guys, there's more
of them over... Ohh!

01:08:17.225 --> 01:08:20.593
Popcorn! Popcorn! Aah!

01:08:24.666 --> 01:08:26.566
Oh!

01:08:26.568 --> 01:08:30.238
Whoo-hoo!

01:08:38.845 --> 01:08:40.782
Hey, Frankie.

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:44.685
Thought I'd stop by, see how you're doing.

01:08:45.353 --> 01:08:47.386
I'm fine.

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:51.225
I also wanted to say that I'm sorry.

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:53.459
Don't worry about it.

01:08:53.461 --> 01:08:55.727
I'm used to people treating me bad.

01:08:55.729 --> 01:08:58.298
Nobody deserves to live like that.

01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:01.334
You know, you don't need to
pretend to like me anymore.

01:09:01.336 --> 01:09:04.437
Hey, I'm not pretending.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:06.606
Then why'd you run out on me?

01:09:06.608 --> 01:09:09.474
I don't regret running away, all right?

01:09:09.475 --> 01:09:11.845
I regret not taking you with me.

01:09:13.814 --> 01:09:17.549
You looked out for me. You're
a good guy with a good heart.

01:09:17.551 --> 01:09:20.087
That's not something
I'm gonna walk away from.

01:09:20.755 --> 01:09:23.189
Why should I trust you?

01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:26.526
What...

01:09:26.528 --> 01:09:28.260
Wh-What are you doing?

01:09:28.261 --> 01:09:30.462
I'm trying to regurgitate
something for you.

01:09:30.465 --> 01:09:35.434
Sorry. I haven't... eaten in a while.

01:09:35.435 --> 01:09:39.938
Whoa, babe! You'd do that for me?

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:44.712
Like you said, together we're Frecious.

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:49.415
Knock them out.

01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:51.718
With pleasure.

01:09:55.890 --> 01:09:58.126
- Now!
- Look out!

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:01.960
No, no, no! Precious!

01:10:01.962 --> 01:10:05.031
I'm fine. It only hit my collar.

01:10:05.033 --> 01:10:06.965
Go! Go! Go!

01:10:06.967 --> 01:10:10.469
This is crazy! You literally
took a bullet for me.

01:10:10.471 --> 01:10:12.037
That's like true love!

01:10:12.039 --> 01:10:14.339
- I guess it is.
- Take the shot!

01:10:14.341 --> 01:10:17.344
Bye-bye, little doggies.

01:10:18.479 --> 01:10:21.680
- Help!
- What are you doing? They're getting away!

01:10:21.682 --> 01:10:24.416
Ow! Tiny teeth are so sharp!

01:10:24.418 --> 01:10:27.653
Do I have to do everything myself?

01:10:27.655 --> 01:10:30.956
Ooh.

01:10:30.958 --> 01:10:33.660
Stop touching me! What
do you have against me?

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:35.995
Not so defenseless now, are we?

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:43.204
Andie, turn him this way! Buddy, fire!

01:10:48.409 --> 01:10:51.510
- Nice shot!
- You shot me with a dart?

01:10:51.512 --> 01:10:54.448
Ooh, ooh. Not good.

01:10:59.453 --> 01:11:02.522
I don't feel so good.

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:05.090
Uhh.

01:11:05.092 --> 01:11:09.764
Ahh. Whoo-hoo!

01:11:10.765 --> 01:11:13.900
Hello, doggies.

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:16.369
Heather, sit!

01:11:16.371 --> 01:11:19.472
Whoa! Play dead!

01:11:19.474 --> 01:11:22.375
Man, I'm good at this. I should get a dog.

01:11:22.377 --> 01:11:25.111
It's coming right for us!

01:11:25.113 --> 01:11:27.479
Take cover!

01:11:27.481 --> 01:11:28.781
Whoa!

01:11:28.783 --> 01:11:31.483
Hey! Hey, stop!

01:11:31.485 --> 01:11:33.054
No!

01:11:40.528 --> 01:11:42.361
Stand up!

01:11:42.363 --> 01:11:46.432
All together! Right. Left.
Right. Left. Right. Left.

01:11:46.434 --> 01:11:48.403
Whoa, Dwayne, are you okay?

01:11:53.073 --> 01:11:56.544
Get him!

01:12:01.448 --> 01:12:04.185
Flying fist!

01:12:08.422 --> 01:12:10.291
Look out!

01:12:10.958 --> 01:12:12.860
Get down!

01:12:27.809 --> 01:12:29.842
Don't mess with the little guy.

01:12:29.844 --> 01:12:31.643
I'm not getting paid enough for this!

01:12:31.645 --> 01:12:35.080
No, you can't leave!
Stop! Stop! I order you!

01:12:35.082 --> 01:12:37.116
Stop right there.

01:12:40.488 --> 01:12:44.757
Oh! Please accept my formal resignation.

01:12:54.168 --> 01:12:56.037
Hmm?

01:12:58.773 --> 01:13:01.107
Mmm! Ohh!

01:13:01.109 --> 01:13:03.643
That is a lot of sugar for a little guy.

01:13:04.945 --> 01:13:06.545
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

01:13:06.547 --> 01:13:09.449
Aah! Ha! Ha! Ha!

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:10.950
No!

01:13:10.952 --> 01:13:12.184
No!

01:13:12.186 --> 01:13:13.885
Yikes.

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:22.227
That has got to be a safety violation.

01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:25.197
Whoever's in charge of
this place is going to jail.

01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:27.532
Whoo. I would hate to be that guy.

01:13:27.534 --> 01:13:29.104
Ha!

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.678
So long, suckers!

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.682
I hear Canada is nice this time of year.

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:44.584
You're not getting away that easy!

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:46.221
Ta-ta!

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:48.153
Huh?

01:13:48.155 --> 01:13:50.089
Aah!

01:13:52.126 --> 01:13:53.925
He's getting away!

01:13:53.927 --> 01:13:56.528
Buddy, we don't have time for rides!

01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:59.098
<i>Please keep your arms and legs
inside the ride at all times.</i>

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:02.634
<i>If an arm or leg becomes detached, you
can pick it up at the lost and found.</i>

01:14:02.636 --> 01:14:05.036
<i>And remember: no refunds!</i>

01:14:05.038 --> 01:14:08.208
The balloon! Buddy, you're a genius!

01:14:11.746 --> 01:14:14.582
Maybe we should put the safety bar down.

01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:21.423
Safety bars are overrated.

01:14:26.261 --> 01:14:29.064
Humans actually like this?

01:14:32.567 --> 01:14:35.002
Whoa!

01:14:35.904 --> 01:14:37.405
Aah!

01:14:39.841 --> 01:14:42.476
It's too far! We're not gonna make it!

01:14:46.046 --> 01:14:49.583
Good idea, Buddy. We
only got one shot at this.

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:53.686
Aah! Aah! Here we go! Here we go!

01:14:53.688 --> 01:14:56.755
Three, two, one... now!

01:14:56.757 --> 01:14:59.925
Aah!

01:15:03.997 --> 01:15:07.701
Oh, I'm going to mount
your head on my wall.

01:15:11.872 --> 01:15:15.040
Time to take down this sack of hot air.

01:15:15.042 --> 01:15:18.009
I should've exterminated
you when I had the chance.

01:15:18.011 --> 01:15:21.313
All right, time to take
down this sack of hot air.

01:15:21.315 --> 01:15:25.720
You destroyed Libertyland.
And now you're going down.

01:15:27.354 --> 01:15:29.789
Aah! Aah! Get off! Get off me!

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:31.357
Whoa!

01:15:31.359 --> 01:15:34.729
It's times like this I wish I had rabies.

01:15:35.997 --> 01:15:37.662
Get off! Get off!

01:15:37.664 --> 01:15:40.635
Whoa! Aah!

01:15:44.238 --> 01:15:46.738
Where is he? Where'd he go?

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:50.310
- Howdy!
- Aah!

01:15:53.747 --> 01:15:56.518
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:02.322
Whoa!

01:16:04.225 --> 01:16:06.791
- Surly!
- Andie!

01:16:06.793 --> 01:16:08.928
Uhh! Ohh!

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:12.999
Whoo. My taxidermist is
gonna have quite the job

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:15.233
putting you back together again.

01:16:15.235 --> 01:16:17.236
Ohh!

01:16:17.238 --> 01:16:19.106
Huh?

01:16:19.806 --> 01:16:21.240
What-What the...

01:16:21.242 --> 01:16:23.041
This one's for Buddy!

01:16:23.043 --> 01:16:26.113
Whoa!

01:16:34.721 --> 01:16:36.955
- I'm okay!
- Attack!

01:16:36.957 --> 01:16:40.726
Aah! Aah! Help! Help!
Help! I'm not okay! Help!

01:16:40.728 --> 01:16:43.896
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:47.232
Wow. Those guys are hungry.

01:16:47.234 --> 01:16:49.802
Use your teeth, fellas! Get in there!

01:16:57.811 --> 01:17:00.379
Mr. Mayor, you're coming with me.

01:17:00.381 --> 01:17:02.281
Oh!

01:17:02.283 --> 01:17:05.817
Sarge, we're gonna take this
into evidence. Code seven.

01:17:05.819 --> 01:17:07.452
Copy that, rookie.

01:17:07.454 --> 01:17:11.156
Get your hands off of
me! Do you know who I am?

01:17:11.158 --> 01:17:14.860
You, sir, are going to
jail for a long time.

01:17:14.862 --> 01:17:18.998
Help! I can't go to jail! I'm rich!

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.735
Get your hands off me!
Do you know who I am?

01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:24.070
Aah!

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:27.173
You. You shot me with a dart!

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:29.909
Please, please, let me explain.

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:33.012
Help! Help! Somebody call the police!

01:17:33.014 --> 01:17:37.717
Her tiny teeth are so sharp! Ow! Ow!

01:17:37.719 --> 01:17:40.622
This amusement park is closed!

01:17:48.863 --> 01:17:50.798
Way to go, Surly!

01:17:53.868 --> 01:17:56.067
Hey, where's Andie?

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:03.308
Whoo-hoo!

01:18:06.913 --> 01:18:09.214
Yeah!

01:18:09.216 --> 01:18:11.217
Whoo-hoo!

01:18:12.987 --> 01:18:15.623
Whoo!

01:18:24.899 --> 01:18:27.333
Way to go, Andie!

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:28.903
Yay, Andie!

01:18:30.872 --> 01:18:32.838
- Whoa.
- Yay, Andie!

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.107
Way to go, Andie!

01:18:35.109 --> 01:18:38.213
Way to go, guys! We did it!

01:18:38.945 --> 01:18:40.979
Ugh! Buddy!

01:18:40.981 --> 01:18:44.215
Ugh! Precious, no licking.
We talked about this.

01:18:44.217 --> 01:18:47.152
Ohh! Come on, man, we just met.

01:18:47.154 --> 01:18:49.388
Ohh!

01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:51.891
Great. Two slobber monsters.

01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:56.094
The mayor is gone! The rides
are destroyed! We're all gonna...

01:18:56.096 --> 01:18:58.030
live!

01:19:06.573 --> 01:19:09.040
<i>It took a lot of clean up
to get rid of Libertyland,</i>

01:19:09.042 --> 01:19:11.277
<i>but everyone in town pitched in.</i>

01:19:11.279 --> 01:19:13.912
<i>Turns out, some humans
aren't half bad.</i>

01:19:13.914 --> 01:19:17.282
<i>Sure, they're ugly and they've got
no fur, but they're not half bad.</i>

01:19:19.220 --> 01:19:23.088
<i>So I bet you're wondering if I learned
some huge lesson from all this.</i>

01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:27.893
- <i>Nope. I'm happy to say I didn't learn a thing.</i>
- <i>Surly.</i>

01:19:27.895 --> 01:19:31.362
<i>Okay, fine. I learned that
we're better together.</i>

01:19:31.364 --> 01:19:35.702
<i>We put aside our differences and work
as a team, there's nothing we can't do.</i>

01:19:37.537 --> 01:19:40.138
<i>Mr. Feng and his friends
moved into the park</i>

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:43.644
<i>and started exploring
more peaceful pursuits.</i>

01:19:44.377 --> 01:19:49.415
Tai chi. It's like fighting in slow motion.

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:51.049
Tough!

01:19:51.051 --> 01:19:53.320
And cute.

01:19:54.121 --> 01:19:56.856
<i>Oh, and one more thing.</i>

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:59.892
<i>I learned to appreciate what
was right in front of me.</i>

01:20:01.996 --> 01:20:03.595
Uhh!

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:10.535
All right, all right,
stop lickin' Uncle Surly.

01:20:10.537 --> 01:20:13.606
I am so sorry. I don't
know what got into them.

01:20:13.608 --> 01:20:17.276
But, Dad, you said it's a
dog's job to chase squirrels.

01:20:17.278 --> 01:20:19.277
Frankie, what are you teaching these kids?

01:20:19.279 --> 01:20:21.179
Hey, I'm teaching them the skills they need

01:20:21.181 --> 01:20:23.449
to be competitive in the dog marketplace.

01:20:23.451 --> 01:20:26.050
Come on, pups. Let's
go mark some territory.

01:20:28.355 --> 01:20:31.089
You know, Andie, you were right.

01:20:31.091 --> 01:20:33.291
I'm so happy we're back in the park,

01:20:33.293 --> 01:20:35.593
living off the land like nature intended.

01:20:35.595 --> 01:20:38.597
I can honestly say I'm a changed squirrel.

01:20:38.599 --> 01:20:40.366
Well, that's great, Surly, because I...

01:20:40.368 --> 01:20:42.870
What is that smell?

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.641
It's... a nut cart.

01:20:48.643 --> 01:20:52.311
Please! Please! I promise
I'll only take one bag.

01:20:52.313 --> 01:20:55.080
Better make it two.
Because I am not sharing.

01:20:55.082 --> 01:20:56.248
Yes!

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:58.384
This is why I love you!

01:21:00.554 --> 01:21:02.353
Let's get nuts.

01:21:02.355 --> 01:21:04.490
- Hyah!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:08.360
Ride, Precious, ride! Hyah!

01:21:10.398 --> 01:21:12.563
Aah!

01:21:52.305 --> 01:21:54.505
Ow, ow!

01:23:24.765 --> 01:23:28.534
Witness the power of my
1/16th-of-an-inch punch.

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:30.938
Aw, that's cute.

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:35.540
- Can we do it one more time? That one didn't feel right.
- Cut.

01:23:35.542 --> 01:23:38.643
- Take 28.
- Aw, that's cute.

01:23:41.748 --> 01:23:44.650
Take 44.

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:48.187

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:51.158
Can we try one without the punch?

01:23:52.725 --> 01:23:55.294
I said, don't call me cute.

01:23:55.296 --> 01:23:59.130
Get them! Do-do-do-do-do.
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

01:23:59.132 --> 01:24:04.871
Aah! You are going to face
the furry of my... Aah!
