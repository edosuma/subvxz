WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.603
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.636 --> 00:04.638
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.607
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.576 --> 00:11.945
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:11.979 --> 00:14.282
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.586
Previously on The Resident...

00:18.619 --> 00:20.088
What happened in the elevator
stays in the elevator.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.989
MINA:
I'm taking your pulse
to make sure you don't

00:22.022 --> 00:23.191
have an arrhythmia.

00:23.224 --> 00:24.525
We are never gonna
have a normal life

00:24.558 --> 00:25.893
if you keep overreacting
to every little thing.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.795
-They found Julian's car.
-Did they find her body?

00:27.828 --> 00:29.163
CONRAD:
Still searching.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.065
DEVON: The landlady
let me in to get Julian's cat.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.866
NIC: And you just
took her phone bill?

00:32.900 --> 00:34.868
DEVON:
Look at the last number
that Julian called.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.070
It was an office at the FDA.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.338
Is Jessie being tested?

00:37.371 --> 00:38.806
JESSIE:
Stop going through
my stuff, Nic.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.874
Quit lying to me!
I'm done trying to save you.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.643
You want your pills?
Take them.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.845
(crying)

00:45.913 --> 00:47.315
* Please don't judge me *

00:47.348 --> 00:50.151
* I am acting,
acting differently *

00:50.184 --> 00:52.686
* And you know me, you know *

00:52.720 --> 00:55.055
* Know what's inside *

00:55.089 --> 00:56.624
* Please always love me *

00:56.657 --> 00:59.360
* Even though
I lost my mind... *

00:59.393 --> 01:01.895
I have a surprise for you.
(moans)

01:05.099 --> 01:07.301
I made a reservation.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.405
To a place you've been
talking about forever.

01:11.439 --> 01:14.242
-Stop. No, you didn't.
-(chuckles)

01:14.275 --> 01:16.210
-At Juniper Zest?
-Yes!

01:16.244 --> 01:18.512
How did you get a reservation
on Valentine's Day?

01:18.546 --> 01:20.114
Ah, anything is possible

01:20.148 --> 01:21.749
when you call
eight months in advance.

01:21.782 --> 01:25.319
(both moan softly)

01:25.353 --> 01:27.388
I'll have to meet you there.
I've got that...

01:27.421 --> 01:29.890
Family Day thing
at Jessie's rehab.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.394
Right. Well, I'm sorry.
That won't be fun.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.028
Mm, which part?

01:35.062 --> 01:36.864
The part where
you hear endless stories

01:36.897 --> 01:38.299
of people hitting rock bottom

01:38.332 --> 01:39.900
or the part where we do
family trust falls?

01:39.933 --> 01:42.703
Oh, my mistake.
That sounds like a blast.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.472
(chuckles):
Oh, God.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.444
-Do you need anything?
-No, I'm fine.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.780
* Please always love me
even though *

01:52.813 --> 01:55.949
* I lo-I lo-I lost
my mi-ind *

01:55.983 --> 01:58.719
* Wake up, survive,
I will get better... *

01:58.752 --> 02:00.421
Mina's been filling me in
on everything.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.291
-Any word from Julian?
-How's your heart?

02:03.324 --> 02:05.193
One thing I'm a little sick of

02:05.226 --> 02:06.827
is everyone asking me,
"How's your heart?"

02:06.860 --> 02:09.129
-I hear that.
-(both chuckle softly)

02:09.163 --> 02:10.798
I found your shirt.

02:10.831 --> 02:13.401
It was still
in the guest room closet.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.403
-Why are those here?
-Don't look at me.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.438
They're for Gertie
down the hall.

02:17.471 --> 02:21.209
It's a thank you
for taking Julian's cat.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.244
Aw, Gertie's a good woman.
She deserves flowers.

02:23.277 --> 02:27.215
As for me, I told Micah
no flowers, no cards, no candy.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.549
(laughs)

02:28.582 --> 02:30.318
-I'll walk you out.
-So I take it

02:30.351 --> 02:31.952
you guys don't have plans
for tonight, then?

02:31.985 --> 02:33.954
Oh, I don't do
corporate holidays.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.757
Oh, she's crazy. I think
all holidays are great holidays,

02:36.790 --> 02:38.759
especially the ones
featuring chocolate.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.594
Look, if you change your mind
about being

02:40.628 --> 02:42.530
wined and dined tonight,
let me know.

02:42.563 --> 02:45.266
-* Please always love me
even though *
-(whispers): Bye.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.869
* I lo-I lo-I lost
my mi-ind. *

02:48.902 --> 02:51.772
-Micah has a key now?
-It was only logical.

02:51.805 --> 02:53.274
Such a romantic.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.409
Micah and I are
right where we should be.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.110
No drama, no surprises.

02:57.144 --> 02:59.780
So let the man take you
to dinner on Valentine's Day.

02:59.813 --> 03:02.049
Oh, is this Dr. Devon
I see with Miss Mina?

03:02.082 --> 03:04.385
Hi, Gertie. I was actually
just coming to see you.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.854
Thank you again
for taking Julian's cat.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.189
Oh, please.
Needy Pete's a joy.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.024
That's what I'm calling the cat.

03:11.058 --> 03:13.627
Little kitty can't stand
to be left alone.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.929
Here.
Gluten-free, dairy-free,

03:15.963 --> 03:18.766
-sugar-free, still delicious.
-Hmm.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.701
Secret recipe.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.971
You come by and visit with
Pete and me any old time, okay?

03:24.004 --> 03:27.040
Not on Tuesday afternoon.
That's Pilates day.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.377
Wednesday and Thursday is yoga.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.645
Monday and Friday is tap class.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.647
Guess what I'm saying is
call me first.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.148
You got it.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.216
Thanks.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.653
Hmm, I think she wants
to be your valentine.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.154
Hilarious.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.190
-You'd make such a cute couple.
-(chuckles)

03:48.996 --> 03:51.365
Happy VD, boss-man.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.033
What do I have today?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.402
Uh, couple of meetings,

03:54.435 --> 03:56.003
and tonight
that black-tie fund-raiser.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.605
Do you need a date for that?

03:57.638 --> 03:59.239
Lots of lonely,
desperate ladies today.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.809
No, Grayson.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.012
Look, don't say I'm the one
that told you, but, uh,

04:05.045 --> 04:06.947
the 'rents
are back on the rocks.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.517
What?

04:09.550 --> 04:12.320
My mom's mad at my dad again.
Maybe you can get back in there.

04:15.356 --> 04:17.891
Grayson, for someone
in my position,

04:17.925 --> 04:20.894
tonight's fund-raiser
is as necessary as it is boring.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.563
And consequently,
I'll be going alone.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.097
However, you may not be aware

04:24.131 --> 04:25.733
that I have
a long-standing tradition

04:25.766 --> 04:28.602
of spending "VD"
with a scalpel in my hand,

04:28.636 --> 04:30.371
so I need you to book
back-to-back surgeries.

04:30.404 --> 04:33.006
I don't care what the specialty
is, make that happen.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.108
-You got it, boss-man.
-Don't call me boss-man.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.610
-You got it, boss.
-Nope.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.247
I got your text.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.049
You know the last person
Julian called?

04:42.082 --> 04:44.151
I tried that number again
on the way to work,

04:44.184 --> 04:46.119
and I finally got a person
on the other line.

04:46.153 --> 04:49.723
It's an FDA agent
named Mark Truscott.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.759
He was the last person
that Julian called.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.127
-Did he say why she called?
-No.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.129
Did it have anything to do
with QuoVadis?

04:56.163 --> 04:58.298
No. She wanted advice.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.933
She was thinking about
changing careers.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.735
(sighs)
I guess that makes sense,

05:01.769 --> 05:03.904
given what she told you
about things being off at work.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.774
Yeah, but Truscott scheduled
a meeting with her.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.175
And she never showed.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.243
That's very odd.

05:10.277 --> 05:14.214
I don't even think the police
are looking for her anymore.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.117
It's like everyone has moved on.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.687
Except me.

05:26.594 --> 05:28.962
What do you think
we'll see the most of today--

05:28.996 --> 05:31.499
suicide attempts
or proposals gone wrong?

05:31.532 --> 05:33.934
-Such a cynic.
-How do proposals go wrong?

05:33.967 --> 05:35.669
You know,
hot-air balloon mishaps,

05:35.703 --> 05:38.439
accidentally drinking engagement
rings in champagne glasses,

05:38.472 --> 05:40.974
people doing stupid things
in the name of love.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.976
See, that's why it's better
to do stupid things

05:43.010 --> 05:44.845
-in the name of sex.
-Hear, hear.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.318
Hmm.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.387
You know you're supposed
to read those first, right?

05:56.123 --> 05:59.092
"Wink, wink."
High literature indeed.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.532
I ordered
some special ones online.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.999
Just for you, Irving.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.736
(giggling)

06:08.769 --> 06:12.305
Um, I think HR would discourage
me from reading these out loud.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.817
What are you doing?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.318
Well, I figure
if I'm going to accept

06:25.352 --> 06:26.987
a fortune from
a stale piece of sugar,

06:27.020 --> 06:29.457
I should at least have
control over what it says.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.258
Oh, look at that.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.360
-"Real love."
-Yeah, don't bother.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.128
Another one with the cynicism.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.030
Listen, bruh,
instead of focusing on

06:37.064 --> 06:39.066
resentment over
what we currently do not have,

06:39.099 --> 06:40.601
let's use today
as an opportunity

06:40.634 --> 06:41.935
to celebrate what's to come.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.975
AJ Austin, doctor of love.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.912
PARAMEDIC:
70-year-old female found
unconscious and asystolic.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.647
A neighbor initiated CPR.

06:53.681 --> 06:56.684
She's been down for 30 minutes.
Still no pulse.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.752
All right, stop compressions,
hold ventilations.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.288
Gertie.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.426
Time of death: 9:06.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.599
She was fine an hour ago.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.467
How did she die?

07:29.750 --> 07:31.418
I only stayed there
a little while,

07:31.451 --> 07:34.622
but still, Gertie remembered
everything about me.

07:34.655 --> 07:37.991
She delivered cookies
for all the holidays.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.928
She acted like
everyone's mother.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.963
-Except in a good way.
-(chuckles softly)

07:42.996 --> 07:45.733
She once told me that
the boys used to call her...

07:45.766 --> 07:47.935
-Flirty Gertie.
-(both chuckle)

07:47.968 --> 07:49.637
(door opens)

07:49.670 --> 07:51.872
Dr. Okafor and Dr. Pravesh.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.607
This is Gertie's niece, Nora.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.009
It's nice to meet you both.
Is Aunt Gertie okay?

07:56.043 --> 07:57.978
Uh, please, have a seat.

08:08.055 --> 08:11.391
Gertie was found unconscious
in her apartment building.

08:11.424 --> 08:14.327
Someone called 911,
and the paramedics did

08:14.361 --> 08:16.496
everything they could
to revive her...

08:17.531 --> 08:19.099
...but your aunt died.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.840
We are so sorry for your loss.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.352
(exhales sharply)
Damn it.

08:39.386 --> 08:42.389
Of course. Of course she died,
today of all days. Damn it.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.057
(Nora sighs)

08:45.726 --> 08:47.695
Now what?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.763
Well, you were listed
as her next of kin.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.032
Great. So who do I need to call?

08:52.065 --> 08:54.334
Funeral home? Cremation place?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.637
Chastain social workers
can help with all of that.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.371
If there's someone else
you need to notify,

08:58.405 --> 09:00.307
like other family members,
they can help with that, too.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.843
There is no one else.
I'm her only living relative.

09:04.477 --> 09:06.446
How long until
the insurance money kicks in?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.185
Look, I know that she was sweet
to everyone else, but with me,

09:12.219 --> 09:13.987
it was judge, judge, judge.

09:14.021 --> 09:17.057
She hated every guy that
I brought home, every damn one.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.392
But this time, I thought
she might like him.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.394
He's nice, no kids,
owns a bike shop in Portland.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.030
I don't make a lot
as a telemarketer,

09:23.063 --> 09:25.198
so I was coming over today
to ask Gertie for money

09:25.232 --> 09:26.934
to help me move to be with him,

09:26.967 --> 09:29.136
and I don't know if she would
have said yes, but...

09:29.169 --> 09:30.370
(groans) Doesn't matter.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.239
This is giving me
another one of my headaches.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.908
Where's the, um...
the death certificate?

09:34.942 --> 09:37.577
We don't have the cause of death
yet to list on it.

09:37.611 --> 09:40.013
She's gone.
Say she died from being old.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.650
Calling the cremation place
to come pick her up,

09:42.683 --> 09:44.384
so give me that
death certificate ASAP.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.428
(indistinct chatter)

09:57.430 --> 09:59.332
Your ortho consult's in Bay Two.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.235
Chet Aiken, 26-year-old male,
single, motor vehicle accident.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.571
Ugh. Boys and their cars.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.674
Yeah. I had to put him
behind a curtain.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.541
He was freaking people out.

10:08.575 --> 10:09.943
(knocks)

10:09.977 --> 10:11.411
License and registration.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.081
They said a doctor
had to get it off me.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.085
Well, that's true.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.923
Looks like a clean impalement.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.425
-Hold the door.
-Hmm?

10:25.458 --> 10:27.594
-Think of England.
-What?

10:27.627 --> 10:30.731
Mmm!
(grunting)

10:30.764 --> 10:32.365
Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.768
-Had to be done.
-(sharp panting)

10:34.802 --> 10:38.105
You're lucky you didn't hit
any bone or arteries.

10:38.138 --> 10:41.108
-Do you have any neck pain?
-No.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.477
You were the driver, right?
How fast were you going?

10:44.511 --> 10:46.980
Um, I don't know.
I couldn't see the speedometer.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.817
How did the door
end up in this position?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.786
These look like
seat belt abrasions,

10:52.820 --> 10:54.187
but they're on
the back of your neck.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.655
Did the airbags deploy?

10:55.689 --> 10:58.425
I don't see any facial bruising
or lacerations.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.727
I-It happened so fast.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.629
She was fine,
but my-my seat belt wasn't on.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.264
You had a passenger?
Is she here?

11:04.297 --> 11:06.333
No. She didn't want to come.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.770
I mean, we didn't know
each other that well.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.605
You weren't driving in the car.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.775
Her profile was awesome.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.711
Like, so awesome that I thought
I might be getting catfished.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.413
Her name even sounds
fake pretty.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.850
-Bella. Am I right?
-Mm.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.317
And then I meet her,

11:24.351 --> 11:26.353
and she's as hot
as she is online

11:26.386 --> 11:28.621
and funny and smart,

11:28.655 --> 11:31.524
and she asked me to get coffee
today, on Valentine's Day,

11:31.558 --> 11:34.094
so, I mean, she must like me,
too, right?

11:34.127 --> 11:36.096
She must like a part of you.

11:36.129 --> 11:39.967
And then after coffee,
we ended up in my car.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.170
But not-not out in the open.
We're not animals.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.806
But one of us
hit the emergency brake.

11:45.839 --> 11:48.641
We rolled down the hill,
and, bam, right into a fence.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.678
It's just, I can't quite work
out the physics of the thing.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.546
Well, the seat was here,

11:53.580 --> 11:57.450
and-and... and she-she was,
she was strapped in, like...

11:57.484 --> 12:01.188
And I... I was more...
I was like...

12:01.221 --> 12:03.190
I am an idiot.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.926
KIT:
Mm, no, you're gonna be okay.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.799
Hello.
Dr. Hawkins.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.633
I'm Andre.
This is Otto.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.402
How fast can you
get him admitted?

12:15.435 --> 12:19.172
Oh, honey, don't be so extra.
It's just a virus.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.041
Just give me some fluids
and acetaminophen.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.876
ANDRE:
Two years in med school
a century ago

12:22.910 --> 12:24.377
does not make you
a doctor today.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.980
-Says you.
-Got out while you could.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.616
Good for you. Yeah.
What do you do now?

12:29.649 --> 12:31.084
I'm a substitute teacher.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.820
Middle school.
That's why he talks like that.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.754
Oh, you low-key love it.

12:34.788 --> 12:38.325
And I want out because we've got
lit Valentine's plans tonight.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.760
-(laughs)
-Denied.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.262
-Wha...
-We're saving our nickels.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.231
It's too late.
I already made a rezzy.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.766
-All right, what can you tell me
about your symptoms?
-Allow me.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.436
He's been tired, weak, dizzy,

12:49.469 --> 12:50.904
and some of his joints
are swollen.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.439
Are you on any medications?

12:52.472 --> 12:54.541
Oh, zero. I-I've been sober
for 20 years.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.277
I don't even take an aspirin
for a headache.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.547
-Stubborn old coot.
-Mind over matter, my love.
(chuckles)

13:00.580 --> 13:03.716
I like that. I'll be back when
I have your initial lab results.

13:03.750 --> 13:06.719
Uh, Dr. Hawkins,
hold on, please.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.655
We have a catastrophic
health care plan

13:08.688 --> 13:10.090
with a high deductible.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.259
-Joys of insurance, huh?
-Mm.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.161
Don't worry.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.629
I will only order tests
that are absolutely necessary.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.067
-(sighs)
-(Otto mutters)

13:20.100 --> 13:22.035
BELL:
Give the appy in OR Three
to someone else.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.004
I want the partial colectomy
that's on the way in.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.605
NURSE PUND:
Yes, Dr. Bell.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.574
(sighs)

13:27.607 --> 13:29.376
I need to fast-track an autopsy.

13:29.409 --> 13:32.079
Today I'm a surgeon.
Ask somebody else.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.646
It's for a patient
who died very suddenly.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.548
She was an active 70-year-old
with no apparent symptoms...

13:35.582 --> 13:37.750
-70? It was her heart.
-That doesn't make any sense.

13:37.784 --> 13:39.386
We can't know that
until the autopsy.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.821
She was a nonsmoker, she
participated in her community,

13:41.855 --> 13:43.656
she was physically active
on a daily basis.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.158
Why are you still talking about

13:45.192 --> 13:47.694
an autopsy like
it's a forgone conclusion?

13:47.727 --> 13:49.329
They cost thousands of dollars.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.398
Unless the family wants
to pay out of pocket

13:51.431 --> 13:52.665
or the coroner wants it

13:52.699 --> 13:54.968
or her insurance authorizes it,
it's not happening.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.636
It's not coming
out of Chastain's budget

13:56.669 --> 14:00.207
because, trust me...
it's always their heart.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.857
Dr. Okafor.

14:17.891 --> 14:20.193
I understand the patient
brought into the ER today

14:20.227 --> 14:21.661
was a friend of yours.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.097
She was my neighbor.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.733
-My condolences.
-Thank you.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.602
You want to talk about it?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.071
No.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.508
Excuse me,
I need to make a call.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.611
(sighs)

14:38.645 --> 14:40.580
Hi, Micah.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.850
I changed my mind about dinner.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.418
See?
I knew it.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.820
Deep down,
you love Valentine's Day.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.523
No.
But I love you, and...

14:50.557 --> 14:52.825
you love Valentine's Day.

14:52.859 --> 14:54.827
And life is too short.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.830
I don't want to be selfish
and just think of myself.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.399
MICAH:
No, you're not being selfish.
You literally

14:59.432 --> 15:00.533
think about everyone.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.069
And I like where this is going.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.737
So, we can have dinner

15:04.771 --> 15:07.140
with all of the traditional
couples tonight.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.942
Yes.
It's a little late

15:08.976 --> 15:11.578
for reservations-- we might
end up at an all-night diner.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.981
But if I'm with you,
it's all good.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.516
(phone beeps)

15:18.085 --> 15:19.552
-(laughs)
-(phone beeps)

15:22.622 --> 15:25.392
Good news, Chet.
You're gonna be just fine.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.360
We reduced your
wrist dislocation

15:27.394 --> 15:29.229
and cleaned up the wounds.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.165
We put you in a splint, and
as long as you keep it immobile,

15:32.199 --> 15:33.733
it should heal quickly.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.568
I'll write you a prescription
for antibiotics

15:35.602 --> 15:37.804
so you won't get
an infection in that arm.

15:37.837 --> 15:39.439
Thanks so much, Doc.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.374
Oh, don't mention it.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.877
We're a little backed up
because apparently this holiday

15:44.911 --> 15:47.047
makes people do
oddly dangerous things,

15:47.080 --> 15:49.949
but someone should be in
in a bit and get you in a sling,

15:49.983 --> 15:51.918
and you can get out of here.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.054
This is the kind of crap
that only happens to me.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.256
I meet a hot girl,

15:56.289 --> 15:58.625
I think she's into me,
and I do something stupid.

15:58.658 --> 16:02.229
Well, to be fair, you did have
a slight technical malfunction

16:02.262 --> 16:04.431
when you hit the
emergency brake. (chuckles)

16:04.464 --> 16:06.766
-No one could've predicted that.
-Maybe.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.602
But she wouldn't even come
to the hospital with me.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.971
I mean, I should've had car sex
with a nice girl.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.908
-You'll get through this.
-People like you don't get it.

16:15.942 --> 16:18.145
I mean, you've never done
anything like this.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.614
Well, maybe not exactly
like this. (chuckles)

16:27.554 --> 16:29.422
You're severely anemic
and your sodium's low.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.890
Looks like someone's getting

16:30.923 --> 16:33.493
steak and spinach for dinner,
extra salt.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.263
I already told you, Italian.
We have a reservation.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.466
Otto... (sighs)
you're also showing signs

16:39.499 --> 16:42.635
of low kidney failure, so I need
to run some more tests.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.505
You won't be able
to leave the hospital today.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.608
On the upside,

16:48.641 --> 16:51.178
cafeteria makes
a mean spaghetti.

16:51.211 --> 16:54.481
I'll bring two bowls up,
we'll pretend we're in Italy.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.649
Remember Rome,

16:56.683 --> 16:58.785
when the Pope blessed us
in the streets?

16:58.818 --> 17:00.153
(laughs):
You wish.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.655
The Pope is not known for
his great love of our people.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.158
OTTO:
Well, maybe it's
a blessing in disguise.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.026
I can cancel tonight
and put that money

17:07.060 --> 17:10.097
into that Alaskan tour
we always wanted to take.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.998
CONRAD:
I'll be back when
I have the results.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.203
Oh, remember that
Caribbean cruise we went on?

17:16.236 --> 17:20.006
Oh, how we danced.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.647
Damn it.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.882
No one cares about the truth,
not the police,

17:29.916 --> 17:31.384
not this hospital.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.120
Gertie's primary care physician

17:33.153 --> 17:34.687
said she died
of atherosclerosis,

17:34.721 --> 17:36.489
which she was never
diagnosed with.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.925
Uh, it's because of her age.
We can't get an autopsy

17:38.958 --> 17:40.993
because no one cares
what kills the elderly.

17:41.027 --> 17:42.895
And now we're supposed to give
a death certificate

17:42.929 --> 17:45.998
to the family that says a lie.
It isn't right.

17:46.032 --> 17:48.835
The government bases their stats
on death certificates.

17:48.868 --> 17:52.805
We might have to work
outside the system

17:52.839 --> 17:55.542
if we want to get this done.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.345
Would you consider donating
Gertie's body to science?

17:58.378 --> 18:00.380
Chastain has a relationship
with a local university...

18:00.413 --> 18:02.048
W-Why?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.016
Well, you'd be helping
to educate future doctors.

18:04.050 --> 18:05.518
Look, my head is killing me.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.754
I'm not weeding through
a bunch of extra paperwork.

18:07.787 --> 18:08.955
I just want
her death certificate

18:08.988 --> 18:10.523
so I can get the money
and move to Portland.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.795
If you donate her body, you
don't have to pay for a funeral.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.064
And I'll get
the death certificate?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.768
Where do I sign?

18:23.536 --> 18:25.372
-(alarms beeping)
-(air hissing)

18:26.406 --> 18:28.575
-What do we have?
-His oxygen levels are dropping.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.743
He was talking about the Pope
and he wasn't making any sense,

18:30.777 --> 18:32.245
and then he started
coughing up blood.

18:32.279 --> 18:34.781
-(coughs, chokes)
-Oh!

18:34.814 --> 18:36.783
Page Pulm and Thoracic.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.885
Tell them he has
massive hemoptysis.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.588
I need that airway cart now.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.957
Step back.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.697
Bronchoscope.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.140
(quietly):
Thank you.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.378
I need a double-lumen
endotracheal tube.

19:05.412 --> 19:08.014
His left lung is hemorrhaging.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.918
ANDRE:
What are you doing?

19:11.951 --> 19:14.654
I'm inserting this tube
to block off the bleeding

19:14.687 --> 19:17.424
and to allow the good lung
to keep getting oxygen.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.635
-Will he be okay?
-We just bought Otto some time

19:28.668 --> 19:30.670
so we can figure out
why this bleeding is happening.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.972
Let's get him
to Interventional Radiology.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.418
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.287
-Surprise. (chuckles)
-What?

19:47.320 --> 19:49.522
-Mm.
-Ooh.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.024
(chuckles)
Mmm.

19:52.058 --> 19:54.861
(both laugh)

19:54.894 --> 19:56.329
-Ooh.
-(laughs)

19:56.363 --> 19:58.197
Hold on, hold on.
Someone might come in.

19:58.231 --> 20:01.100
Oh, so let them.
It's Valentine's Day,

20:01.133 --> 20:03.970
-and I'm getting some sugar.
-Wait, wait, wait.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.373
Do you want to meet
on the on-call rooms on three?

20:06.406 --> 20:09.609
Huh? I could sneak up there
and meet you in a few minutes.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.011
Or we could walk
up there together.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.714
Jess, come on.
We're at work.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.817
-And?
-And it's not professional.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.319
(scoffs)
So what? Other people

20:19.352 --> 20:21.321
have relationships at work.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.222
It's complicated, that's all.

20:25.024 --> 20:27.193
I don't think
it's complicated at all.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.195
You come to my apartment,
you make pasta,

20:29.228 --> 20:32.532
we watch movies, and you rub
my feet, and you like it.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.200
-Can you...
-(indistinct chatter
in distance)

20:34.233 --> 20:35.835
(quietly):
just a little less?

20:35.868 --> 20:36.869
No, I cannot!

20:40.273 --> 20:42.475
What, are you ashamed of me?

20:42.509 --> 20:45.545
That's...
No, of course not.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.880
That's a crazy thing to say.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.450
Okay.
Well, then let's go, right now.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.087
Take my hand and walk
down the hall with me.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.729
Hmm.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.937
You know, no one thought

21:10.970 --> 21:13.205
you were any great prize
either, Irving...

21:15.174 --> 21:17.209
...but I did.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.886
(phone vibrating)

21:29.155 --> 21:31.924
Hey! How's it going?

21:31.958 --> 21:33.493
Oh, you know, ball of fun.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.928
Yeah, I bet.
You doing okay?

21:35.962 --> 21:37.764
Oh, sure.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.433
Turns out, trust fall thing--
not a joke.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.936
-Oh. Anyone get dropped?
-No, but I thought about it.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.372
(sighs)

21:45.405 --> 21:47.206
You know what Family Day is?

21:47.239 --> 21:48.941
It's a day for addicts
to blame their families

21:48.975 --> 21:50.009
for their addictions.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.744
I'm about to kick a few people
in the shins.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.245
Well, that sounds about right.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.981
(sighs)
There's more.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.816
There's a group thing
in the morning.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.751
I have to stay overnight.
I can't

21:58.785 --> 22:01.388
come to the restaurant with you,
Conrad. I'm so sorry.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.055
That's okay.
We'll do it some other time.

22:03.089 --> 22:05.592
Oh, but you called eight months
ago to book a table.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.226
I'll just give it
to somebody else.

22:07.259 --> 22:08.795
Nic, really,
it's just a day on the calendar.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.464
-Of course you need
to be there with Jessie.
-It sucks.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.766
I know.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.802
MAN:
Door three closing.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.706
I got to go.
Another session's starting.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.609
-Don't kick anyone.
-I'll try.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.677
Happy Valentine's Day.
I love you.

22:24.711 --> 22:26.345
-Happy Valen...
-(phone beeps)

22:30.617 --> 22:32.585
(Chet groaning faintly)

22:35.388 --> 22:37.790
(Chet groaning, grunting)

22:37.824 --> 22:40.893
What in heaven's name? Chet!

22:40.927 --> 22:42.895
Chet, are you okay?
Unlock the door!

22:42.929 --> 22:45.598
(groans):
Ow, she broke me again.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.034
Bella, I assume.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.169
Sorry. He said
he was good to go.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.539
I said you had to be gentle.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.173
It was nice to meet you.

23:00.246 --> 23:01.881
(monitor beeping steadily)

23:07.687 --> 23:09.889
Biopsy results are back.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.591
He has an autoimmune disorder.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.860
It's attacking his blood vessels

23:13.893 --> 23:15.828
and it's what caused the anemia
and the kidney failure.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.430
NOLAN:
Polyarteritis nodosa.

23:17.464 --> 23:19.866
It's treatable with medication.
Once we've got it under control,

23:19.899 --> 23:21.901
you can go back
to your normal life.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.235
Right.

23:23.269 --> 23:25.538
(sighs):
Our normal life.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.278
Andre, this is good news.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.180
Otto will recover.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.182
I know.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.184
But...

23:38.217 --> 23:41.220
that's not the only thing
going on here, is it?

23:41.253 --> 23:43.790
He's talking about a cruise
we never went on.

23:43.823 --> 23:48.260
And about Tijuana
and this casino in Vegas.

23:48.294 --> 23:51.931
All things we said we'll do
someday, but we haven't yet.

23:51.964 --> 23:55.535
Now, at first, I thought
he was joking or confused,

23:55.568 --> 23:59.438
but then I called to cancel the
Italian place near our house.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.741
It turns out, he never had
a reservation there.

24:01.774 --> 24:04.477
It was a lie.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.646
Or he forgot.

24:08.347 --> 24:10.349
Or he was drunk. (sighs)

24:12.384 --> 24:14.554
His drinking--

24:14.587 --> 24:17.657
that's why he didn't
finish med school.

24:17.690 --> 24:21.928
I was young; I thought
I'd scored with this hot doctor.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.031
Then he started lying
about where he'd been,

24:25.064 --> 24:26.633
what he was doing.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.536
Took me years to figure it out.

24:29.569 --> 24:32.171
Then years for him to get sober.

24:32.204 --> 24:36.643
And it was worth it because...
God, I love that man.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.647
But now here we are.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.218
I can't do this again.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.621
Andre...

24:48.655 --> 24:51.123
I don't think Otto is drinking.

24:51.157 --> 24:53.926
Nothing indicating that
came up in his blood tests.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.795
Then why is he doing this?

24:55.828 --> 24:58.531
Tell me more about what he says.

25:00.600 --> 25:03.269
How would you like to do
something epic and romantic

25:03.302 --> 25:05.337
for Valentine's Day?

25:05.371 --> 25:07.339
What do you have in mind?

25:07.373 --> 25:10.476
Cut into my dead neighbor lady
to find out what killed her.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.178
You're asking me
to perform an autopsy?

25:12.211 --> 25:13.880
Since we technically
don't have permission,

25:13.913 --> 25:15.915
we'll say
it's for your anatomy class.

25:15.948 --> 25:18.651
So you want me
to help you steal an autopsy.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.322
Sexy. I'm in.

25:34.801 --> 25:37.169
(door opens)

25:37.203 --> 25:40.573
Gather around the table.
Don't get in their way.

25:40.607 --> 25:42.642
You know, I forgot
how easy it is to maneuver

25:42.675 --> 25:44.711
when you're not trying
to keep someone alive.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.879
And when you don't have to stop
to suction blood out of the way.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.514
Are we late or something?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.049
Did class already start?

25:50.082 --> 25:51.684
Yeah, why wasn't this field trip
in the syllabus?

25:51.718 --> 25:54.654
Shh. Let the surgeons
concentrate.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.723
(gasps)
Look, they skipped the lungs.

25:56.756 --> 25:58.324
MINA: In honor of the holiday,
we decided to start

25:58.357 --> 26:01.393
-with the heart.
-I wanted to see the lungs.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.131
My parents pay a lot of money
for my education.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.036
AUSTIN: Well, you tell
your parents congratulations.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.838
Today, they got a deal.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.906
Most students
at your level have never seen

26:13.940 --> 26:16.042
a fresh cadaver dissection.

26:21.213 --> 26:24.116
You, coupon cutter,

26:24.150 --> 26:25.885
if this cadaver had
atherosclerosis,

26:25.918 --> 26:28.054
what would the arteries
look like?

26:28.087 --> 26:29.856
They'd be hard and narrow.

26:29.889 --> 26:33.092
Correct.
Now look at these babies.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.728
They are as wide
and free-flowing

26:35.762 --> 26:38.731
as summer water
on a mountain range.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.833
There's no plaque at all.

26:40.867 --> 26:43.202
AUSTIN:
Explain, student.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.604
This person did not die
of heart disease.

26:45.638 --> 26:49.976
If atherosclerosis
didn't kill her, what did?

26:50.009 --> 26:52.044
I intend to find out.

27:02.521 --> 27:04.891
(door opens, closes)

27:04.924 --> 27:06.525
(lock clicks)

27:06.558 --> 27:07.960
Hello?

27:14.266 --> 27:16.836
Those candy hearts were
extremely inappropriate.

27:18.437 --> 27:21.273
They gave me
an inappropriate idea.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.443
See, this day is all about
couples, which, let's face it,

27:24.476 --> 27:26.478
can be hell for the rest of us.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.748
Now, I'm not looking
to couple up,

27:28.781 --> 27:31.918
but I could use a distraction.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.786
A distraction?

27:33.820 --> 27:36.555
Mm-hmm. I'm not
in a thing right now.

27:36.588 --> 27:38.490
I've never seen you in a thing.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.693
You do like
sex with women, right?

27:41.861 --> 27:43.662
Great.

27:43.696 --> 27:46.365
Then my place, your place,
I don't really care.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.667
Just be freshly showered,
bring your own birth control,

27:48.701 --> 27:50.636
and no cuddling after.

27:50.669 --> 27:55.007
It's a onetime offer, and I will
deny it ever happened.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.943
So?

27:59.779 --> 28:01.781
Congratulations.

28:01.814 --> 28:04.416
You just sexed yourself
into a Galeazzi fracture,

28:04.450 --> 28:07.186
and now I have to operate
on your arm.

28:07.219 --> 28:09.288
(sighs):
I'm sorry.

28:09.321 --> 28:12.124
Who does their business
in a hospital?

28:12.158 --> 28:16.028
Do you have any idea how many
bacteria are festering in here?

28:16.062 --> 28:17.696
One in 20 patients contracts

28:17.730 --> 28:18.931
a health care-associated
infection.

28:18.965 --> 28:20.867
What were you thinking?

28:20.900 --> 28:23.302
Bella texted to see
if I was all right, so...

28:23.335 --> 28:26.305
I thought that maybe
we could be a thing, after all.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.875
The time for her to ask
if you were okay

28:28.908 --> 28:30.910
was when you were removed
from her vagina

28:30.943 --> 28:32.544
and put into the ambulance.

28:32.578 --> 28:34.380
She didn't do that,

28:34.413 --> 28:38.217
which means she is not looking
for a relationship with you.

28:38.250 --> 28:41.620
But she said she never
had sex in a hospital.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.091
There are love matches,

28:45.124 --> 28:47.559
and there are sex matches.

28:47.593 --> 28:50.196
You're saying that
this is only a sex match?

28:50.229 --> 28:53.432
I'm saying this is neither.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.467
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

29:00.773 --> 29:05.778
And now we get a look
inside this woman's computer.

29:05.812 --> 29:07.546
Don't you see inside people
all the time?

29:07.579 --> 29:09.548
We're not neurosurgeons.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.550
We don't often get
the opportunity to witness

29:11.583 --> 29:14.220
the majesty
that is the human brain.

29:37.643 --> 29:40.246
So, as Dr. Okafor
dissects the brain,

29:40.279 --> 29:42.081
she is using
a technique called?

29:42.114 --> 29:44.283
Fiber tract
dissection technique.

29:44.316 --> 29:45.717
SEBASTIAN:
She's looking for evidence of

29:45.751 --> 29:47.619
a disease process
that could cause sudden death.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.755
MINA:
Mystery solved.

29:49.788 --> 29:52.591
Cause of death:
ruptured brain aneurysm.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.226
SEBASTIAN:
Why did she have an aneurysm?

29:54.260 --> 29:56.728
-DEVON: Any guesses?
-She was born with it?

29:56.762 --> 29:57.964
That's often the case,
but this woman

29:57.997 --> 29:59.098
was 70 at the time of her death.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.033
That is a long time to live

30:01.067 --> 30:03.069
without knowing about
a congenital defect.

30:03.102 --> 30:04.403
She may have
some other condition

30:04.436 --> 30:06.005
which could cause
the aneurysm to form.

30:06.038 --> 30:09.575
In an autopsy, we have
the luxury of a deep dive.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.444
We found no evidence of disease
in the thoracic cavity.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.081
Now we get to explore further
in the abdomen.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.116
Let the party begin.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.664
Liver looks clear.

30:32.698 --> 30:34.233
Kidneys do not.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.236
What are those?

30:37.269 --> 30:38.837
Cysts. A lot of them.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.974
It looks like Gertie had
polycystic kidney disorder.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.976
Can go undetected for years.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.778
Brain aneurysms are often
complications of PKD.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.247
It's a genetic condition.

30:48.280 --> 30:50.316
Her niece Nora
is having headaches.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.650
AUSTIN: Oh, well,
she could very well have

30:51.683 --> 30:52.985
-an aneurysm like her aunt.
-MINA: Yeah.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.520
We need to get her into
an MRI machine immediately.

30:54.553 --> 30:56.822
I'll alert the radiologist.
We need a stat read.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.290
And if we're right,
there's a ticking time bomb

30:58.324 --> 30:59.691
waiting to go off in her head.

31:04.330 --> 31:05.597
(door opens)

31:05.631 --> 31:06.798
Why am I back in this room?

31:06.832 --> 31:08.767
Did someone else die?

31:08.800 --> 31:12.438
Nora, the professor of the class
you donated Gertie's body to,

31:12.471 --> 31:13.839
he found something.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.508
Your aunt died
from a brain aneurysm.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.644
He also found cysts on her
kidneys, leading us to believe

31:18.677 --> 31:20.246
that she had
polycystic kidney disease.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.681
We think you may have it, too.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.850
-That's crazy. I feel fine.
-So did Gertie.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.618
This morning,
you said you had a headache.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.020
Which I got from you,

31:28.054 --> 31:29.655
because everything about this
is terrible.

31:29.688 --> 31:31.357
But then you had another one
later on.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.993
-How often are you getting them?
-I mean, most days,

31:34.026 --> 31:36.562
but my life is annoying.
It would give anyone a headache.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.530
Okay, we need to do
an MRI of your brain

31:38.564 --> 31:40.066
to make sure that's all it is.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.101
So, I don't even have
the insurance money yet,

31:42.134 --> 31:45.204
and now I have to spend it all
on some tests that I don't need?

31:45.237 --> 31:46.738
This is what doctors do.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.907
I don't like overtesting
any more than you do.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.876
But in this case,
your life could be in danger.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.311
This is the only way
to find out.

31:52.344 --> 31:53.712
Well, my insurance is crap.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.247
How much is that
gonna put me back?

31:55.281 --> 31:56.582
Okay, we can talk
to billing about it,

31:56.615 --> 31:57.583
but, Nora, listen to me.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.885
If you have an aneurysm
in your brain,

31:59.918 --> 32:01.453
it could rupture at any time.

32:01.487 --> 32:02.588
We need that MRI.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.024
Oh, fine.

32:05.057 --> 32:07.193
Okay.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.228
Grab your things.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.629
(water running)

32:10.662 --> 32:12.664
That in there is one hot mess.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.700
His wrist is the least
of his problems.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.735
BELL: Yeah, I've made
some mistakes in my life,

32:16.768 --> 32:19.972
but being that guy is one
I've managed to avoid.

32:20.006 --> 32:22.008
So what's the rest
of your day like?

32:22.041 --> 32:24.576
Oh, after this,

32:24.610 --> 32:28.647
quick lap chole,
and then a fund-raiser.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.683
Oh, Cupid Fights Cancer
in Midtown?

32:31.717 --> 32:34.386
-That's the one. You going?
-I am.

32:36.355 --> 32:39.225
Seems kind of silly
to take two cars.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.960
It does, doesn't it?

32:43.929 --> 32:46.332
(water running)

32:46.365 --> 32:47.933
NOLAN:
This is Otto's MRI.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.402
Uh, loss of brain volume,
the obvious atrophy.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.404
You're looking at damage
caused most likely

32:52.438 --> 32:54.073
by years of alcohol abuse.

32:54.106 --> 32:56.542
(sighs) These symptoms
are just surfacing now

32:56.575 --> 32:58.744
after Otto's been
sober for years.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.279
People don't realize
the damage from alcohol

33:00.312 --> 33:01.913
can last a lifetime.

33:01.947 --> 33:04.416
There's no surgery.
There's no medicine.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.018
There's no way to repair this.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.155
Dementia's only gonna get worse.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.823
I'll speak with Andre.

33:15.794 --> 33:18.364
(monitor beeping steadily)

33:18.397 --> 33:21.400
DR. GUY: First time
in a brain, Dr. Okafor?

33:21.433 --> 33:23.735
MINA:
A live one, yes.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.506
Ah. The vessel walls
are so thin.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.208
GUY:
They are.

33:29.241 --> 33:31.277
The patient's lucky
you caught this when you did.

33:31.310 --> 33:32.511
It was about to burst.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.448
Look, here's a second aneurysm.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.817
MINA:
That one is smaller. Less risky.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.986
GUY:
You know the surgical adage,

33:41.019 --> 33:43.289
"See one, do one, teach one"?

33:43.322 --> 33:45.324
I do.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.326
Well, you just saw one.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.228
Care to try doing one?

33:49.261 --> 33:51.363
I would.

33:51.397 --> 33:52.598
Hmm.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.034
Isolating the vessel.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.307
(monitor beeping steadily)

34:01.340 --> 34:03.075
DEVON:
The surgery was a success, Nora.

34:03.109 --> 34:06.478
You had two aneurysms,
and they've both been fixed.

34:06.512 --> 34:08.547
And I won't get any more?

34:08.580 --> 34:10.582
And now that you're aware
of your PKD,

34:10.616 --> 34:12.818
you can go in for regular
screenings to minimize risk.

34:12.851 --> 34:16.088
And it's all because you donated
Gertie's body to science.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.725
No.

34:19.758 --> 34:22.228
It was because of Aunt Gertie.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.502
She was a good woman.

34:30.536 --> 34:32.504
I will miss seeing her
in the building and...

34:32.538 --> 34:34.906
Anyway, did you get
that death certificate?

34:34.940 --> 34:37.008
I'm gonna need her money
to pay for this operation

34:37.042 --> 34:38.877
and move to Portland.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.783
CONRAD:
It's called "confabulation."

34:44.816 --> 34:46.418
He's getting things confused,

34:46.452 --> 34:48.487
so his brain makes up
the reality for him.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.189
But why is it happening?

34:50.222 --> 34:52.158
We think it's a result
of brain damage

34:52.191 --> 34:55.026
due to his past alcoholism.

34:55.060 --> 34:56.595
(sighs)

34:56.628 --> 34:59.231
Sometimes the damage
shows up years later.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.600
He's having a hard time
differentiating between

35:01.633 --> 35:04.270
what did happen
and what could happen.

35:04.303 --> 35:07.072
But the most important thing
to know is that Otto

35:07.105 --> 35:09.441
doesn't mean to hurt you.

35:09.475 --> 35:12.344
We were saving our nickels
for Paris.

35:12.378 --> 35:16.715
For Zurich, Bora Bora, Vietnam.

35:16.748 --> 35:20.386
I know this is difficult,
but you can still be together.

35:20.419 --> 35:23.355
Once Otto is stabilized,
he can go home with you.

35:23.389 --> 35:24.990
Home. We were gonna see
the whole world.

35:25.023 --> 35:27.459
I know.
But if you want to be with Otto,

35:27.493 --> 35:30.496
you now have to find a way
to be with him in his world.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.922
(monitor beeping steadily)

35:56.955 --> 35:59.625
Andre, why are we still here?

35:59.658 --> 36:02.961
Did we go out
for Valentine's Day?

36:02.994 --> 36:05.030
I-I can't recall.

36:06.232 --> 36:07.466
Let me show you something.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.941
* Follow me into... *

36:15.974 --> 36:17.609
(Otto gasping)

36:19.645 --> 36:22.314
Oh, it's so beautiful.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.617
Did we go to Paris?

36:25.651 --> 36:28.019
I-I can't quite recall.

36:32.358 --> 36:33.759
We did go.

36:33.792 --> 36:36.194
And it was beautiful.

36:36.228 --> 36:38.697
(laughs softly)

36:41.032 --> 36:42.401
(Otto gasps)

36:42.434 --> 36:45.971
-(sighs): Oh, it's Spain.
-(quietly): Yeah.

36:46.004 --> 36:48.607
Vejer De La Frontera.

36:48.640 --> 36:52.678
We sat near that fountain,
and we kissed for hours.

36:54.145 --> 36:56.315
I remember.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.617
It was so romantic.

36:58.650 --> 37:02.321
* Next to you *

37:02.354 --> 37:06.625
* Walking with a ghost *

37:06.658 --> 37:08.059
(Otto sighs)

37:10.028 --> 37:13.164
Hawkins, I got your text.
What's good?

37:13.198 --> 37:15.200
Eh, you know
what's happening in there?

37:17.703 --> 37:19.671
Looks like a lot of money
spent on stock images.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.373
That's a couple in love.

37:21.407 --> 37:23.909
And when one couldn't
leave his world,

37:23.942 --> 37:27.012
the other found a way to make it
better than reality.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.680
Interesting.

37:28.714 --> 37:31.049
Here.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.385
Word on the street is
you're quite the romantic.

37:33.419 --> 37:36.054
Well, I have been known
to write a sonnet or three.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.556
What's this?

37:37.589 --> 37:40.392
It's a reservation
for a very hot table

37:40.426 --> 37:42.728
-at a very hot restaurant.
-Whoa. Wow.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.196
I can't go,
so you should take someone.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.533
You know, I hear
their scallop appetizers

37:47.566 --> 37:50.001
actually make the angels weep.

37:51.236 --> 37:53.372
Thanks, man, but I think
I'm gonna pay it forward

37:53.405 --> 37:56.475
-and give it to someone else.
-Who?

37:56.508 --> 37:59.077
Someone who's already in love.

38:02.781 --> 38:08.520
* I am here alone next to you *

38:08.554 --> 38:10.889
* Walking with... *

38:10.922 --> 38:13.224
Jessica.

38:13.258 --> 38:14.893
I want to show you something.

38:16.762 --> 38:19.631
Before you say no, just look.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.634
Really?

38:22.668 --> 38:25.604
A crappy sign
and a mid-floor hookup?

38:25.637 --> 38:27.606
Just because
it happened here once...

38:27.639 --> 38:29.207
Jessica, wait.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.609
I freaked out.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.378
I thought maybe
if I went public with you,

38:32.411 --> 38:34.012
people might think it was funny.

38:34.045 --> 38:35.547
Because it's so funny

38:35.581 --> 38:37.282
that someone would want
to be with me?

38:37.315 --> 38:40.719
No. Because of me.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.254
No one here has ever
looked at me that way,

38:43.288 --> 38:44.956
like an option.

38:44.990 --> 38:46.958
But I guess that's not true.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.461
I could be with someone else,
just like you could.

38:51.196 --> 38:53.799
But I don't want that.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.435
Chastain maintenance
put that sign up.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.105
-(elevator bell dings)
-They gave us 30 minutes.

39:05.511 --> 39:07.345
(laughs)

39:08.547 --> 39:10.849
You told maintenance about us?
(chuckles)

39:12.818 --> 39:16.955
* Can you hear me? *

39:16.988 --> 39:18.289
* Can you hear me... *

39:18.323 --> 39:20.759
(shouting):
I'm gonna tell everyone!

39:20.792 --> 39:23.462
(laughs)

39:26.131 --> 39:29.935
* I am here alone next to you *

39:29.968 --> 39:31.903
* Next to you *

39:31.937 --> 39:36.875
* Walking with a ghost... *

39:40.412 --> 39:43.381
Wow. Don't you look dapper.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.019
I could say the same thing.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.589
Could you?
You'd say "dapper"?

39:50.622 --> 39:52.023
N-No, no, I wouldn't,
I wouldn't prob--

39:52.057 --> 39:53.925
I wouldn't say-- I mean,
dapper wouldn't be the...

39:53.959 --> 39:54.993
Shh.

39:55.026 --> 39:59.665
* Can you hear a raven call? *

39:59.698 --> 40:05.203
* Shadows on an empty wall *

40:05.236 --> 40:09.174
* Distant even though
we lay close... *

40:09.207 --> 40:10.609
Shall we?

40:13.545 --> 40:15.514
* Hollow hands... *

40:15.547 --> 40:18.584
Well, we don't want
to be late, do we?

40:19.651 --> 40:23.489
* Can you hear me? *

40:23.522 --> 40:26.792
* Can you hear me...? *

40:26.825 --> 40:30.496
* If you can't feel me *

40:30.529 --> 40:32.864
* If you can't *

40:32.898 --> 40:37.102
* I am here alone next to you *

40:37.135 --> 40:39.505
* Next to you *

40:39.538 --> 40:44.142
* Walking with a ghost *

40:46.311 --> 40:51.182
* Walking with a ghost. *

40:51.216 --> 40:53.619
You were supposed to be at
the most exclusive restaurant

40:53.652 --> 40:54.953
in Atlanta right now.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.855
The restaurant
I have brought to you

40:56.888 --> 41:00.058
is so much better,
you have no idea!

41:00.091 --> 41:04.129
(chuckles) There's a band
playing the most romantic...

41:04.162 --> 41:06.965
-(over stereo):
* I can dream about you *
-Oh.

41:06.998 --> 41:08.734
-...'80s pop songs.
-(both laugh)

41:08.767 --> 41:10.435
-I'll take it.
-Okay.

41:10.468 --> 41:14.973
We are serving
gourmet cuisine, starring

41:15.006 --> 41:17.843
(French accent):
the string fromage,

41:17.876 --> 41:21.479
(normal voice): uh, some sort of
processed meat stick thingy,

41:21.513 --> 41:23.882
and two apples,
only mildly bruised.

41:23.915 --> 41:25.984
-Very nutritious.
-Exactly.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.621
-(French accent): And to drink,
we have the sparkling water.
-(laughs)

41:29.655 --> 41:31.790
(normal voice):
Because I have to drive back.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.324
But if there's anything
you taught me...

41:33.358 --> 41:35.326
Everything tastes better
in a wine glass.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.362
* How to hold me just right *

41:38.997 --> 41:40.566
* Moving... *

41:40.599 --> 41:43.769
-Happy Valentine's Day.
-Mm.

41:43.802 --> 41:45.771
* I don't see under my feet... *

41:45.804 --> 41:48.206
CONRAD (sighs):
Mm.

41:49.474 --> 41:51.442
(Nic sighs)

41:51.476 --> 41:53.211
With everything
that's going on with Jessie,

41:53.244 --> 41:55.981
I wish there was
more I could do.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.983
I know.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.285
But you being here
makes everything a bit better.

42:00.318 --> 42:04.089
* I can dream about you... *

42:04.122 --> 42:06.992
And this, I mean...

42:07.025 --> 42:09.294
Just about perfect.

42:09.327 --> 42:12.463
* I can dream about you *

42:12.497 --> 42:15.200
* You know how to hold me
just right *

42:17.168 --> 42:20.806
* I can dream about you. *

42:20.839 --> 42:22.373
(R&B music playing quietly)

42:22.407 --> 42:24.009
MICAH:
Uh, for the record,

42:24.042 --> 42:25.644
I called this place,
and they said

42:25.677 --> 42:28.213
they couldn't even get me in
until next Valentine's Day.

42:28.246 --> 42:30.315
Lucky Dr. Austin gave us
his reservation. (chuckles)

42:30.348 --> 42:32.283
He says to try
the scallop appetizer.

42:32.317 --> 42:33.885
All right.

42:33.919 --> 42:35.453
You okay?

42:35.486 --> 42:37.288
-You're all sweaty.
-I'm fine.

42:37.322 --> 42:39.490
Your pulse is racing, too.

42:39.524 --> 42:42.193
No, it's not.
Please, stop.

42:43.862 --> 42:45.831
Thank you.

42:56.074 --> 42:58.910
Micah? Someone call 911!
He's had a heart transplant!

42:58.944 --> 43:01.546
Wait, Mina. Wait, wait, wait.

43:02.447 --> 43:04.850
Okay, so my pulse may be
racing a little,

43:04.883 --> 43:07.686
and it is my heart, but it's not
because of my transplant.

43:19.264 --> 43:21.867
Dr. Mina Okafor...

43:21.900 --> 43:23.468
will you marry me?

43:23.501 --> 43:25.904
(patrons applauding)

44:11.382 --> 44:13.384
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:15.120 --> 44:16.888
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:16.922 --> 44:18.924
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:22.327 --> 44:24.129
Welcome to the galaxy.

44:25.330 --> 44:27.298
Should be fun. I'll lead.

44:29.134 --> 44:32.003
* We're breaking waves
Shooting stars *

44:32.037 --> 44:33.404
We're gonna make a run for it.

44:33.438 --> 44:34.639
* Live for glory, not forever *

44:34.672 --> 44:39.110
