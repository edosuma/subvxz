WEBVTT

00:04.471 --> 00:06.140
Previously on ER:

00:06.174 --> 00:07.675
You two know
each other.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.210
Gordana's here
to observe

00:09.243 --> 00:10.444
a correctional
congenital heart repair

00:10.478 --> 00:11.545
on a young boy from Croatia.

00:11.579 --> 00:14.182
Eric... where are you?

00:14.215 --> 00:15.616
I have to go get him.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.451
Why?

00:17.485 --> 00:18.819
I mean, Eric's been
gone for weeks.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.421
What's one more day?

00:20.454 --> 00:22.523
He's off his meds,
and if I don't go now,

00:22.556 --> 00:24.058
he might disappear again.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.426
John, you really need
to take this call.

00:25.459 --> 00:26.627
He's in V-tach.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.596
WEAVER:
It's your grandmother.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.498
I'm sorry.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.266
( sobbing )

00:32.299 --> 00:34.268
GALLANT:
Okay, cough for me.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.203
( coughs )

00:35.236 --> 00:36.537
How much longer?

00:36.570 --> 00:37.805
Chuny, can you call Psych
for this guy?

00:37.838 --> 00:38.706
Already did.

00:38.739 --> 00:39.807
A moth flew in my ear.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.075
I'm trying
to lure it out.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.210
HORVAT:
Is Dr. Kovac here?

00:42.243 --> 00:43.511
What the hell
would you do?

00:43.544 --> 00:44.578
Try Trauma One.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.116
KOVAC:
V-fib,

00:48.149 --> 00:49.183
charge again.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.518
Hey.

00:51.752 --> 00:53.121
Charged.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.123
Okay, clear.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.496
360 again.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.170
Charged.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.271
Clear.

01:18.579 --> 01:23.151
Time of death:
9:37.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.560
MAN:
Sorry to trouble you
with this today.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.395
CARTER:
That's all right.
I understand.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.430
These are
complicated issues.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.898
They certainly are.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.534
I wanted to give you time
to think about things,

01:40.568 --> 01:41.669
and... look over
the papers

01:41.702 --> 01:43.604
before the will
is officially read.

01:43.637 --> 01:44.672
Mm-hmm.
I'll make sure to.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.274
Cal.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.609
Well, I didn't realize
you were here, Jack.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.578
Well, I flew in
three days ago.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.613
I telephoned you in New York.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.415
Did you get my message?

01:54.448 --> 01:56.550
That's Eleanor's
apartment now.

01:56.584 --> 01:57.918
Oh.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.522
I just... wanted to express
my condolences.

02:01.555 --> 02:04.558
Well, I'll, uh, see you both
at the service.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.626
I appreciate
the visit.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.295
Bye.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.267
Is red not somber enough?

02:13.301 --> 02:14.502
No, you look fine.

02:14.535 --> 02:17.905
She liked men
to wear red ties.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.708
That's very
Republican of her.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.776
I think
that's blue now.

02:22.810 --> 02:26.514
I didn't realize, uh, estate
lawyers made house calls.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.249
The Foundation Board

02:28.282 --> 02:30.251
has called an emergency
meeting for next week.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.485
He just wanted me
to be prepared.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.221
Prepared for what?

02:33.254 --> 02:37.625
Gamma stipulated it in her will
that I be put in charge.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.560
She appointed me President.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.899
I see.

02:45.933 --> 02:49.537
Well, I think
that would be a good thing.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.704
( chuckles )

02:50.738 --> 02:52.473
For me or the Foundation?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.308
Both.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.245
It should be you, Dad.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.613
Well, I guess that's
not what she wanted.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.783
Well, I think she figured
I'm in Chicago,

03:02.816 --> 03:04.585
it'd be easier
for me.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.521
She put you in charge
of the family fortune,

03:07.555 --> 03:10.258
and left me with a little
bachelor's trust fund.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.394
I don't think it was
a question of geography.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.463
I've also tried to stay
as involved as I could.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.530
John, who are
you kidding?

03:16.564 --> 03:18.266
Want me to tell you
the truth?

03:18.299 --> 03:21.502
She was disappointed in you
as a son, as a father...

03:21.535 --> 03:23.337
She didn't think
you were up to it.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.507
You could sugar-coat it
a little.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.680
It's an opportunity for you.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.014
Not one
that I wanted.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.285
Now I'm stuck having
to run the damn thing...

03:37.285 --> 03:38.586
or walk away.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.788
Looks like she managed
to screw us both.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.023
Almost time.
Are we waiting on Abby?

03:43.056 --> 03:45.526
She's meeting us
at the cemetery.

03:47.000 --> 03:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:59.607 --> 04:01.709
That's good.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.944
You look like a hooker.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.981
( crashing )

04:12.586 --> 04:13.587
Eric!

04:17.391 --> 04:18.426
What are you doing?

04:18.459 --> 04:19.593
I broke into
your apartment.

04:19.627 --> 04:20.594
I'm home.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.562
I can see that now.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.963
What happened to you?

04:22.996 --> 04:25.699
I got into a fight with
a guy in the lunch room.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.601
He took the last Jell-O cup.

04:27.635 --> 04:28.936
God.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.505
What? He cut the line.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.607
You're a mess.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.975
Yeah, I had to jump
through a window

04:35.008 --> 04:36.410
and scoot through some bushes.

04:36.444 --> 04:37.611
It's a voluntary program.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.647
You can leave
whenever you want.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.482
Where's the fun in that?

04:43.517 --> 04:45.519
You're not taking
your meds.

04:45.553 --> 04:47.888
I have, I swear.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.491
I just lowered
the dosages a bit.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.025
How?

04:52.059 --> 04:53.661
By cheeking them.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.930
They had me on too much.
It was a real downer.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.567
Okay, so a few hours
after our conversation,

04:59.600 --> 05:01.068
you pick a fight
with another patient...

05:01.101 --> 05:02.936
Client.
They call us clients.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.638
...and then skip out
on the whole thing.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.375
Yeah, I think maybe we could
find a better situation,

05:07.408 --> 05:08.976
you know, like in Maui.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.080
You should've called me.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.549
Give me that.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.950
( sighs )

05:16.984 --> 05:18.919
Why didn't you call me?

05:18.952 --> 05:20.954
I don't know.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.490
I really don't.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.724
Maybe I should just go.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.793
No, sit down,
sit down, sit down.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.528
I could use a drink,
I know that.

05:30.431 --> 05:32.433
Is your apartment spinning?

06:27.187 --> 06:28.689
You feel that?
¿Le duele?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.624
Dejalo.
¿Tiene otro médico?

06:30.658 --> 06:33.093
Tu eres un hombre malo.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.828
I'm working
for la migra.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.497
No quiero que el toque mijo.

06:36.530 --> 06:37.931
She says you're
a bad man

06:37.965 --> 06:39.199
and she doesn't want you
touching her son.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.968
Oh, get an abdominal scan
with contrast

06:41.001 --> 06:42.603
to rule out appendicitis,

06:42.636 --> 06:44.838
and tell Evita here I can
prescribe a good ESL class.

06:44.872 --> 06:45.806
Rayos Equis.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.074
23-year-old
minor leaguer.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.809
Sinkable episode
after wind sprints.

06:48.842 --> 06:49.910
Tu eres un jerk.

06:49.943 --> 06:50.944
She says
you're a jerk.

06:50.978 --> 06:51.979
Yeah, got that.

06:52.012 --> 06:53.080
Parietal hematoma on the left.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.648
BP 104/58.
Pulse 120.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.617
He got dizzy,
so I walk him

06:56.650 --> 06:58.185
to the dugout, he
must've hit his head

06:58.218 --> 06:59.820
on the steps when
he passed out.

06:59.853 --> 07:03.524
CBC, chem panel, UA, EKG,
lateral C-spine and head CT.

07:03.557 --> 07:04.825
ROMANO:
No Battles.

07:04.858 --> 07:05.959
Has he had incidents
like this before?

07:05.993 --> 07:07.160
This guy's
a stallion.

07:07.194 --> 07:08.896
He went from
instructional league

07:08.929 --> 07:10.498
to Triple A
in a single season.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.765
That's impressive.
Chest is clear.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.200
Belly's benign.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.935
He was on his way to be
called up to the show.

07:14.968 --> 07:15.936
What show?

07:15.969 --> 07:17.237
Ignore him. He's fine.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.972
Shoot the neck film
and get him to CT.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.040
Uh, you good here?

07:20.073 --> 07:21.642
Yeah, sure, I'll use my foot

07:21.675 --> 07:23.043
to put on the BP cuff.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.545
That boy has gotten worse.

07:24.578 --> 07:25.546
What boy?

07:25.579 --> 07:26.814
Onta, the Croatian kid.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.649
I thought it was all
set up at Mercy?

07:28.682 --> 07:29.517
It needs to happen sooner.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.118
No, no, no.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.920
We have enough trouble taking
care of our own uninsured.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.187
He's dying, Kerry.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.223
His mother smuggled him
onto a plane.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.825
I-I need you
to try again, please.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.059
Look, even
if they donate

07:39.092 --> 07:40.628
medical supplies
and facilities...

07:40.661 --> 07:42.963
I know, the rest would be
for me to take care of.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.732
The cardiothoracic team,
nurses, transport...

07:44.765 --> 07:46.667
I'll do it.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.803
Don't count
on anything.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.777
Jaycee said she'd do it
on one condition--

07:56.810 --> 07:58.245
she needs two weeks off in June

07:58.278 --> 08:00.247
that the surgical N.M.
denied her twice already.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.882
I-I can't control
vacation schedules.

08:01.915 --> 08:03.584
Hey, everything's
on negotiation.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.619
I thought nurses were supposed
to be angels of mercy.

08:05.653 --> 08:06.954
Even mercy has a price.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.622
Jerry, can you track
this flight for me?

08:08.656 --> 08:10.658
Mm-hmm.
Air Flugelros?

08:10.691 --> 08:12.125
Yeah, it has
a sick kid on it.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.894
They don't have hospitals
in Germany?

08:13.927 --> 08:16.129
And get Dr. DeFord on the phone.
I'll take it in here.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.264
Checking out
of Loser's Lounge?

08:17.297 --> 08:18.231
Try not to kill anyone, Lurch.

08:18.265 --> 08:19.733
We'll do our best.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.301
CT's back on
the ball player in Two.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.236
Negative-- looks
like a concussion.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.139
Except his 12-lead EKG shows a
corrected QT at a level of .49.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.875
Long QT syndrome?
I doubt it.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.643
He's just a young athlete
who's trying to...

08:29.677 --> 08:30.678
Yeah, I know, "Baseball

08:30.711 --> 08:31.979
been berry
berry good" to him.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.179
Let's check a family history,
just to be sure.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.582
Okay.

08:34.615 --> 08:35.749
You know what?
I'll do it myself.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.083
I thought you
were going home.

08:37.116 --> 08:40.320
Well, you know me.
I live for this place.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.823
She used to tell me
how much it meant

08:42.856 --> 08:44.091
to have you in her life.

08:44.124 --> 08:46.927
She was lucky to have you
looking after her.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.195
Oh, I was the lucky one.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.663
This is Gammy's good friend,
Vivian.

08:49.697 --> 08:50.764
Hello.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.065
Are you a relation?

08:52.099 --> 08:53.233
I'm her son.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.335
I'm so pleased to meet you.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.104
Thanks for coming.
This way, please.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.806
They're almost ready
to start, Dr. Carter.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.774
Let's wait another
five minutes.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.009
Abby not here yet?

09:02.042 --> 09:03.944
Yeah, I sent
a car for her, but...

09:03.977 --> 09:05.212
I guess she's running late.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.780
MAN:
So what do you do for that?

09:06.814 --> 09:08.181
Well, surgeons
can insert an ICD.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.618
It's an implantable
cardioverter defibrillator,

09:10.651 --> 09:13.186
and that can shock your heart
back into a normal rhythm.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.822
He doesn't drink
enough water.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.289
He was probably
just dehydrated.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.325
If I get one
of those things, an ICD,

09:18.358 --> 09:20.160
what then?

09:20.193 --> 09:22.095
Well, then you'll be on
beta blockers and rest

09:22.129 --> 09:23.864
for about six months,
after which we can

09:23.897 --> 09:25.833
gradually increase your
level of strenuous activity.

09:25.866 --> 09:26.967
Six months?

09:27.000 --> 09:27.968
No, we can't stop
playing for...

09:28.001 --> 09:29.369
Lucia, please. Por favor.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.971
A guy with
a heart condition
who gets dropped out

09:31.004 --> 09:32.272
for a whole season,

09:32.305 --> 09:34.207
what team will ever take
a chance on you then?

09:34.241 --> 09:37.177
With long QT, there's a risk of
cardiac arrest and sudden death.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.212
You don't understand.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.380
I'm about to get
my shot.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.314
Tuesday night

09:41.348 --> 09:42.716
at Wrigley Field.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.185
Our whole life
has been waiting for this.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.823
All right, well, we can
treat this less aggressively,

09:49.857 --> 09:50.958
but just for the moment.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.826
Dr. Lewis,
you have a minute?

09:52.860 --> 09:54.261
Yeah.
Thank you,
doctor.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.929
I'm expecting
box seats.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.765
Do you want a cards
consult for the ICD?

09:57.798 --> 09:59.032
Nah, just give IV fluids

09:59.066 --> 10:00.133
and a stress test
later in the day.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.835
I thought you were
recommending...

10:01.869 --> 10:03.103
I had an ER overreaction
kick in.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.237
I worked through it.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.305
All right.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.340
( yawning )

10:07.374 --> 10:11.211
* Wake up, Little Susie,
wake up *

10:11.244 --> 10:15.182
* I promised your mama I'd
have you home by 10:00... *

10:15.215 --> 10:16.416
Have the paperwork
for us

10:16.449 --> 10:17.350
to look over.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.752
What paperwork?

10:18.786 --> 10:19.720
You know,
the end of the affair.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.288
Oh, right.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.857
Jerry, get me the surgical
nurse manager back on the phone.

10:23.891 --> 10:24.892
You ever think about

10:24.925 --> 10:26.326
getting a personal assistant?

10:26.359 --> 10:28.662
Susan, drunk in Three's
waiting on his banana bag.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.764
And you,
I need to talk to you.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.132
I'll be back in a minute.

10:32.165 --> 10:33.400
Okay.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.135
What are you doing tonight?

10:35.168 --> 10:38.872
Take it easy, cowboy,
I'm a married man.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.841
Thanks.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.741
( Road Runner cartoon plays )

11:22.315 --> 11:24.918
O God, whose mercies
cannot be numbered,

11:24.952 --> 11:27.988
accept our prayers on behalf
of your servant Millicent

11:28.021 --> 11:31.892
and grant her an entrance into
the land of light and joy

11:31.925 --> 11:34.361
in the fellowship
of your saints.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.930
Tears have
been my meat

11:36.964 --> 11:40.133
day and night.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.002
While they daily
say to me,

11:42.035 --> 11:43.904
"Where now
is your God?"

11:43.937 --> 11:46.807
Now when I think
about these things

11:46.840 --> 11:49.042
I pour out my heart
by myself

11:49.076 --> 11:51.011
for I went
with the multitude

11:51.044 --> 11:53.213
and brought them into
the house of God.

11:53.246 --> 11:57.951
Why are you so full of
heaviness, O my soul?

11:57.985 --> 12:01.922
And why are you so
disquieted within me?

12:01.955 --> 12:03.456
Just as the deer

12:03.490 --> 12:04.892
longs for the water brooks,

12:04.925 --> 12:07.260
so longs my soul
after you, O Lord.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.361
What are you doing?

12:08.395 --> 12:09.797
There was a minibar
in there.

12:09.830 --> 12:10.463
You know how vodka
goes through me.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.965
Get back in the car.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.033
I'm trying to make
this work, Abby.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.034
You just
got to give me

12:14.067 --> 12:15.869
a little
more room here.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.805
I swear to God, if you do not
get back in this car this minute

12:17.838 --> 12:19.239
I will get a gun
and I will shoot you dead.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.473
Wow.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.809
You learn that approach
in nursing school?

12:21.809 --> 12:23.076
Get in the car.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.913
ERIC:
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.815
Then stop
chasing me.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.916
Eric...

12:28.949 --> 12:30.984
Hey, John,
what's up?

12:31.018 --> 12:33.220
Why are you so
disquieted within me?

12:33.253 --> 12:34.421
Put your trust in God...

12:34.454 --> 12:35.923
JACK:
You need to calm
down, son.

12:35.956 --> 12:38.091
Sorry about your
grandmother.

12:38.125 --> 12:41.194
It's tough to lose somebody.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.262
Why don't we go...

12:42.295 --> 12:43.463
This is quite
a send-off.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.098
She must have been very loved.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.434
Or very rich.

12:47.467 --> 12:48.335
Eric...

12:48.368 --> 12:50.370
Sorry.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.873
I don't feel so good.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.083
Brought your brother.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.586
It's not exactly my
bowl of rice, Kovac.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.955
Besides, I've
got a date.

13:07.988 --> 13:08.989
Hot little brunette
in radiology.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.357
Oh, you'll be disappointed.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.525
Hey, listen, all you'd have
to do is be there

13:12.559 --> 13:14.094
as a support surgeon.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.163
Uh, some dying kid's
desperate mom stuck him

13:16.196 --> 13:17.965
aboard a plane, huh?

13:17.998 --> 13:20.233
You know, that's almost enough
to pluck at my heartstrings,

13:20.267 --> 13:22.535
which I might add,
are notoriously unpluckable.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.274
I'll really be disappointed.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.342
Trust me.

13:32.645 --> 13:36.283
Will Corday be scrubbing in?

13:36.316 --> 13:37.284
Says here under
the Illinois

13:37.317 --> 13:38.451
Marital
Dissolution Act,

13:38.485 --> 13:39.920
"A marriage can
be invalidated

13:39.953 --> 13:41.288
for only one of the
following reasons."

13:41.321 --> 13:42.589
Okay, keep going.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.624
Uh, fraud. Did you
ever fake anything?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.226
No. You?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.627
No. I'm just
a screamer.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.897
Uh, "Unacknowledged
prior marriage?"

13:49.930 --> 13:51.398
Right, like either
of us is a bigamist.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.400
I have an uncle
who's a Mormon.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.202
Next.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.270
Uh... "Under the age
of legal consent."

13:57.304 --> 13:58.371
Don't I wish.

13:58.405 --> 13:59.539
Don't I wish.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.074
"Lack capacity
to acquiesce

14:01.108 --> 14:02.642
"to the use of
drugs, alcohol,

14:02.675 --> 14:05.412
or some mind-altering
controlled substance."

14:05.445 --> 14:06.479
I think we have a winner.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.415
Which one of us
was trashed?

14:08.448 --> 14:09.216
Split the difference.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.918
Okay, you know,

14:10.951 --> 14:12.552
let me be the
gentleman this
one last time.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.287
Oh, I don't recall
any precedent for that.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.189
Okay, so you're going
to have to sign these,

14:16.223 --> 14:17.590
and I'll take them
into Family Court.

14:17.624 --> 14:18.992
Here.
Okay.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.393
All right.
Don't kick my ass.

14:20.427 --> 14:24.031
Just, uh, initial paragraph two
and sign page three.

14:24.064 --> 14:26.233
Done... and done.

14:26.266 --> 14:27.367
All right,
there we go.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.601
Unknotting the
bonds of love?

14:28.635 --> 14:30.070
Yeah, something like that.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.271
Or impetuous lust.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.405
Maybe something in between.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.041
Jennifer Rosen, 43.
See you later?

14:34.074 --> 14:35.508
Yeah. Call me
when we're divorced.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.177
Picked her up at home.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.279
She was a neighbor's
Botox party last night.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.380
Botox party?

14:40.413 --> 14:41.581
Your day
will come.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.250
She's having
trouble swallowing.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.517
I'm sorry, Luka.
I just can't.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.386
I'm getting DeFord
Steen from Rush

14:46.419 --> 14:48.521
to do the Tet repair,
but I still need a County

14:48.555 --> 14:49.689
support team.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.124
It's just too far afield
for me.

14:51.158 --> 14:52.325
Come on. I'll
do anything.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.526
I'll-I'll mow
your lawn.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.995
I'll-I'll
baby-sit Ella.

14:55.028 --> 14:55.963
Over my dead body.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.297
And this guy's, too,

14:57.330 --> 14:59.166
if you don't tie off
that bleeder.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.501
Suction from above.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.571
Three-O proline
on a needle driver.

15:04.604 --> 15:05.672
Look, Luka,

15:05.705 --> 15:07.374
I appreciate your commitment.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.608
I really do, but
don't you think

15:08.641 --> 15:10.143
this is all just
a little bit...

15:10.177 --> 15:11.478
rash?

15:11.511 --> 15:15.082
It's the only chance
this boy has.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.552
Is Dr. Dorset part
of this team?

15:19.586 --> 15:21.688
Uh...

15:21.721 --> 15:23.490
is-is that a problem?

15:23.523 --> 15:25.592
Yes.

15:29.029 --> 15:32.165
Okay, no, no. Fine.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.501
F-Fine. I'll do it.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.339
He's calmer now.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.508
I gave him some
Depakote.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.410
How much?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.512
The whole bottle.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.150
I was stuck.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.251
I-I...

15:51.284 --> 15:52.519
He couldn't
be left alone,

15:52.552 --> 15:54.387
and I really wanted
to be here with you,

15:54.421 --> 15:56.356
and I thought he would
just wait in the car,

15:56.389 --> 15:58.525
and I'm really
sorry, John.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.264
I'm going to drop him
off at the hospital,

16:04.297 --> 16:06.299
and then I'll come
by the house, okay?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.634
What for?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.502
Because he agreed
to be evaluated,

16:09.536 --> 16:11.304
maybe go into a locked ward.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.706
No, I mean,
why come by the house?

16:24.151 --> 16:26.086
I know...

16:26.119 --> 16:28.321
what happened was terrible.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.559
Unforgivable, really, but...

16:34.527 --> 16:36.629
my brother is sick,
and he's struggling.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.531
I'm just trying to
help him survive.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.667
I know.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.303
So go do that.

17:01.388 --> 17:02.555
Didn't your
doctor tell you

17:02.589 --> 17:04.257
that Botox is
not FDA-approved

17:04.290 --> 17:05.425
for neck wrinkles?

17:05.458 --> 17:07.394
They say botulism is beautiful.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.296
Yeah, until you need
an NG feeding tube.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.463
A what?

17:10.497 --> 17:11.830
It's an internal
catheter

17:11.864 --> 17:13.833
which goes from your
nose to your stomach.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.602
Now, you'll have
to use that

17:15.635 --> 17:18.204
to feed yourself
about four cans
of solution a day.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.606
Will I lose weight?

17:19.638 --> 17:21.608
GSW times three
en route.

17:21.641 --> 17:23.109
That's not the point.

17:23.109 --> 17:24.176
How long till they get here?

17:24.211 --> 17:28.281
Now.

17:28.315 --> 17:29.616
Gallant, let's take her
in suture.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.118
Pratt, two kids coming in.

17:31.118 --> 17:32.619
GSW to the right
hand, chest and arm.

17:32.652 --> 17:33.820
My babies.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.122
Where... where are my babies?

17:35.155 --> 17:36.723
They are right behind us.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.725
Turner Mitchell,
single GSW to
the upper abdomen.

17:38.758 --> 17:39.759
Where does it hurt, Turner?

17:39.792 --> 17:40.627
Where the bullet went in.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.162
Nine-year-old girl.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.596
Multiple abrasions
to the head and neck.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.831
Denies LOC.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.366
I'm okay.
Help my kids first.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.568
They're being taken care of,
Mrs. Mitchell.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.403
BP's 100/74
after two liters.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.604
...over 64.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.173
But he's tachy at 120.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.208
Hold him steady.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.443
I can't find any GSW.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.610
Me, either.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.546
My back hurts,
my neck.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.747
What's your name,
pretty girl?

18:00.780 --> 18:01.848
Noelle.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.350
Well, Merry
Christmas, Noelle.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.584
We're going to
fix you right up.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.618
One, two...
Three.

18:05.652 --> 18:08.421
BP's 90 systolic.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.823
Single small-caliber wound
in the right lateral chest.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.525
We were watching Bugs Bunny.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.194
The window started...
Exit wound.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.429
smashing and then...
Okay, hang
another liter.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.697
Betadine the
right chest.
Nothing.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.831
Good, Gallant.
Keep going.

18:18.865 --> 18:21.534
My-my stuff'll

18:21.568 --> 18:23.603
come around
for-for a second time.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.372
Is there a husband
we can call?
No, he's gone.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.839
It's just-just me now.
Okay.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.541
Ma'am I'm going
to numb you up, okay?

18:28.575 --> 18:30.543
What about my kids?
I'll go check
on them.

18:30.577 --> 18:31.744
Prep and anesthetize.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.180
I'll be back for the chest tube.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.747
BP's down to 64/48.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.849
Sterile gloves
and a seven French
triple lumen.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.818
Gallant's going to need
the SonoSite when you're done.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.520
Take it.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.455
Dr. Kovac, there's
a telephone call for you.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.290
They say it's important.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.691
Take a message.

18:44.724 --> 18:45.792
Let's prep a six-O
ET tube and a two mac.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.527
80 of SUX
and ten of etomidate.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.462
It's that airplane
that you asked me to track.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.631
Okay, ask them
what the problem is.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.633
Uh, hey, uh, what's the problem?

18:53.666 --> 18:55.768
Okay, wire's in.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.604
Needle back.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.239
Is this the Unifo kid?

18:59.272 --> 19:00.640
Yeah. Sounds like a Tet spell.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.875
He's saying bad breathing
and "Blau."

19:02.909 --> 19:04.344
Okay, hold out the phone.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.279
Okay, catheter
is in.

19:06.313 --> 19:09.549
Hook up
the infuser.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.784
Morphine
from the medicine...

19:11.818 --> 19:13.753
Pressure's only up
to 70.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.555
Luka, go ahead.
I got it.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.689
Okay.

19:16.723 --> 19:17.857
Take it outside.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.292
DPL kit for Pratt?
Over there.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.493
What?

19:20.527 --> 19:21.661
Says he's doing
DPL on the girl.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.595
My pager's going mad.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.830
Oh, start up here.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.298
I got to go see
what the hell he is up to.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.499
NG tube and a Foley.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.734
What's his first Hemacue?
12.8.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.302
Talk to me, Pratt.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.938
She's persistently hypotensive
and bradycardic

19:31.971 --> 19:34.607
with warm, dry skin
and good CAP refill.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.808
Spinal shock.

19:35.842 --> 19:36.876
Or complete transection.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.245
Hi, sweetie.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.247
Can you squeeze my hand?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.814
Shrug your shoulders?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.583
I can't feel anything.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.817
Okay. Don't worry.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.619
We're going
to take good care of you.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.555
She has no motor
or sensory below C5.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.789
Where's the GSW?

19:49.822 --> 19:50.957
There isn't any.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.459
Her mom pulled
a bookcase down

19:52.492 --> 19:53.693
to protect her.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.628
Oh, must have caused
a spinal cord injury.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.364
Like, I said,
she needs a DPL.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.432
Do a SonoSite,
and wait for Corday.

19:59.466 --> 20:00.633
Start the steroids?

20:00.667 --> 20:02.001
Uh... yeah.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.803
900 milligrams
of Solumedrol,

20:03.836 --> 20:05.738
then 5.4 per hour.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.299
( screams )

20:32.332 --> 20:33.766
It is an unfortunate situation,

20:33.800 --> 20:36.336
but if Mercy is committed
to doing the surgery,

20:36.369 --> 20:37.704
then they should follow through.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.005
That's not going
to happen.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.740
And our facilities
provide the best--

20:40.773 --> 20:42.642
perhaps the only--
last-minute option.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.011
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I need an answer.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.713
It's hard enough

20:46.746 --> 20:49.549
to keep pace with
our own problems, Dr. Kovac.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.652
If it were a wealthy businessman
in need of an artificial heart,

20:52.685 --> 20:54.454
we'll find the reason to do it.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.356
Artificial heart
implantation

20:56.389 --> 20:57.924
is a cutting-edge
surgery

20:57.957 --> 20:59.926
that has benefits
to medical science,

20:59.959 --> 21:01.861
as well as the patient.
I know all that.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.396
You don't have
to tell me.

21:03.430 --> 21:04.864
We're talking about
one sick boy here...

21:04.897 --> 21:06.899
Uniform and Tet Repair,
while important, are more...

21:06.933 --> 21:10.637
who we have the ability to save,
but not the will to do it!

21:10.670 --> 21:13.940
( sighs )

21:13.973 --> 21:16.343
And after all the talk,
we won't save this boy

21:16.376 --> 21:19.646
for only one reason:
because we don't want to.

21:19.679 --> 21:22.349
It's more complicated
than that, Luka.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.883
Yeah, you're right.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.985
There's also the money.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.734
( door closes )

21:43.936 --> 21:47.607
I didn't know Gamma had
The Collected Oscar Wilde

21:47.640 --> 21:48.875
in first edition.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.910
Oh.

21:50.943 --> 21:55.014
There was a story about him
late in his life

21:55.047 --> 21:57.717
she... loved to tell.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.018
I can't really remember.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.621
He was on his deathbed
drinking champagne,

22:01.654 --> 22:04.724
and a friend of his asked him
what he was doing,

22:04.757 --> 22:06.926
and he said, "Isn't it obvious?

22:06.959 --> 22:09.662
I'm dying beyond my means."

22:12.799 --> 22:14.401
She was a society lady

22:14.434 --> 22:16.969
with the heart
of Stonewall Jackson.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.975
I didn't mean
what I said before.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.011
Oh, it is what it is, John.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.680
We can't pretend
it was anything else.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.020
Not much of a party, huh?

22:34.053 --> 22:36.423
Not much of a funeral.

22:36.423 --> 22:38.591
It was certainly memorable.

22:38.625 --> 22:41.494
More like embarrassing.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.863
So, Abby's not here.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.768
I was just having
a hard time mingling.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.603
Sharing duck canapés and cosmos

22:50.637 --> 22:53.540
with a bunch of people
that I don't really know.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.875
You don't need to stay
if you don't want.

22:55.908 --> 22:56.976
It's all right.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.812
I'm sorry, Dad.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.919
I'm really sorry.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.456
I feel like I blew it.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.123
Well, you didn't.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.460
Neither did Abby.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.031
Let it go, son.

23:21.601 --> 23:25.472
Just let it go.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.039
They're ready for her
up in CT.

23:27.073 --> 23:28.708
So, you're on Harper, huh?

23:28.741 --> 23:30.943
I live on Williams
about six blocks east.

23:30.977 --> 23:33.780
I don't know any doctors
in our neighborhood.

23:33.813 --> 23:34.714
So, what do
you want to be?

23:34.747 --> 23:36.215
A fashion designer.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.150
Oh, that's good,
but with a smile like that,

23:38.184 --> 23:39.986
you should think
about becoming a model.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.888
Stuff like that never happens.

23:41.921 --> 23:42.922
Oh, sure it does.

23:42.955 --> 23:43.990
I've seen it happen.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.692
I'll come find you later, okay?

23:45.725 --> 23:47.927
We'll bring you back
as soon as the CT's done.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.195
I still can't
move anything.

23:49.228 --> 23:50.930
Why can't I move?

23:50.963 --> 23:52.198
We're going
to figure that out.

23:52.231 --> 23:54.000
Dr. Romano,
did you forget something?

23:54.033 --> 23:55.101
Yeah, I did.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.603
Denzel, I
need my Ancef,

23:56.636 --> 23:57.670
Exam Two, pronto.

23:57.704 --> 23:58.905
IM or IV?

23:58.938 --> 24:00.106
What's it matter to you?

24:00.139 --> 24:01.874
Nurses always
give antibiotics.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.943
And I've got to push this girl
through CT.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.044
Well, let her do that.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.145
You come with me now.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.914
Come on.
I haven't got all day.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.617
Romano's got
a new bitch, huh?

24:14.053 --> 24:15.922
Malik, hook me up with
a portable defibrillator

24:15.955 --> 24:16.923
and a drug box.

24:16.956 --> 24:29.702
Is somebody going
on a run?

24:29.736 --> 24:31.137
I'm not sure
why you'd want

24:31.170 --> 24:32.739
an Affirmative
Action imbecile

24:32.772 --> 24:34.140
fixing you up,

24:34.173 --> 24:35.842
but if you're trying
to humiliate me...

24:35.875 --> 24:36.709
Zip it.

24:36.743 --> 24:37.744
You've demonstrated

24:37.777 --> 24:39.178
a certain amount
of integrity.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.180
Now, it won't last long
if you keep working here,

24:41.213 --> 24:43.115
but for the time being,
it suits my purposes.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.751
I'd prefer to keep this
between us.

24:44.784 --> 24:45.618
How did that happen?

24:45.652 --> 24:46.953
It's not important.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.821
There's some tissue
that's devitalized.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.189
It'll probably need
debridement.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.824
Look, I don't know
much about burns,

24:51.858 --> 24:53.092
but I'd say you're
going to need

24:53.125 --> 24:55.027
a little bit more
than debridement.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.128
Just do it.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.263
Just do it?

24:57.296 --> 24:59.065
Some of this is
circumferential.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.133
The vessels under the
eschar look charred.

25:01.167 --> 25:04.604
I don't even know if
I can take care of
an injury that severe.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.673
All right, then.

25:08.941 --> 25:09.876
I'll get Corday.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.578
No, get Lewis.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.813
She's the least annoying
of the bunch down here.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.047
Look, Dr. Romano,

25:15.081 --> 25:17.016
you need a surgeon
to examine that.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.819
I am a surgeon.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.191
Hey, Jerry, have you seen

25:25.224 --> 25:26.626
Abby?

25:26.659 --> 25:27.794
Ah, she's off today.

25:27.827 --> 25:29.061
I thought you were, too.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.897
Jerry, tell Malik
to let me know

25:30.930 --> 25:33.199
when the postical
postal worker
in Four wakes up.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.635
Postical... I don't think
I can even say that.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.804
Carter, I thought you
went to the funeral.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.138
Yeah, if you can call it that.

25:39.171 --> 25:40.239
Excuse me.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.307
Curtis Mitchell.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.709
They say my family's here.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.110
Uh, yeah,
I'll take you to them.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.177
You going
to be here a while?

25:45.211 --> 25:46.813
Did they tell you
what happened?

25:46.846 --> 25:47.980
Yeah, they told me.

25:48.014 --> 25:49.081
Your mom was lucky.

25:49.115 --> 25:50.683
A bullet passed
through her chest,

25:50.717 --> 25:52.619
but we were able
to reinflate her lung.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.286
What about Turner?

25:54.320 --> 25:56.055
Shot to the abdomen,
but he's stable.

25:56.088 --> 25:57.957
And my little sister?

25:57.990 --> 25:59.892
Uh, no bullet wounds--
that's good,

25:59.926 --> 26:03.029
but a bookcase fell on her,
so there's some paralysis,

26:03.062 --> 26:04.864
which we're hoping
is temporary,

26:04.897 --> 26:07.834
but we won't know more
until we get back her CT.

26:17.043 --> 26:19.311
Hey, Mama.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.880
How are the kids?

26:20.913 --> 26:22.114
Did you see them?

26:22.148 --> 26:23.750
No, not yet.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.151
Are you all right?

26:25.184 --> 26:27.787
I was trying to protect her.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.255
It's not your fault.

26:29.288 --> 26:32.124
I-I pulled the bookcase
down on top of her.

26:34.393 --> 26:36.028
Did you see who did this?

26:39.999 --> 26:41.934
Mama, did you see who did this?

26:41.968 --> 26:44.671
Don't do anything, Curtis.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.773
You hear me?

26:48.307 --> 26:51.010
Don't you do anything.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.981
Have them send type-

26:55.014 --> 26:56.315
specific
to the OR.

26:56.348 --> 26:57.349
That's my brother.

26:57.383 --> 26:58.751
Cefoxitin's
on board.

26:58.785 --> 26:59.986
Turner?
Second unit's in.

27:00.019 --> 27:00.953
That's my brother.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.021
What's going on?

27:02.054 --> 27:03.389
We're taking him
to the OR.

27:03.422 --> 27:04.957
He needs
exploratory surgery.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.125
He's bleeding
internally.

27:06.158 --> 27:07.694
Can you make it stop?

27:07.727 --> 27:09.395
We think a bullet
ripped into his spleen.

27:09.428 --> 27:10.429
We may need
to remove it.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.764
Turner,
you all right?

27:11.798 --> 27:12.999
We got to get
him upstairs.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.735
You stay strong,
little man, okay?

27:17.704 --> 27:19.972
Stay strong, little man.

27:25.778 --> 27:28.815
Boy, the standard of care
really does suck here.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.759
Miss Perez?

27:39.792 --> 27:43.029
He's got a swing
like a young Ted Williams.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.464
That's what everybody says
anyway.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.199
Sounds like
a natural.

27:47.233 --> 27:48.968
I just...

27:49.001 --> 27:50.436
We can't give
up on that.

27:50.469 --> 27:53.139
You don't have
to explain it to me.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.373
Robert.

27:54.406 --> 27:56.175
Shall we, uh,
step inside?

27:56.208 --> 27:58.811
Gallant told me
what happened.

27:58.845 --> 28:01.047
So much for
his integrity.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.815
He was concerned.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.083
( sighing )

28:05.451 --> 28:07.119
May I?

28:07.153 --> 28:09.756
It may be a little worse
than I thought initially.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.826
Normally,
in order to determine

28:13.860 --> 28:15.762
full assessment
for escharotomy...

28:15.795 --> 28:16.963
We need to determine
pain in...

28:16.996 --> 28:19.165
which we cannot
do in this case,

28:19.198 --> 28:23.402
because I'm the guy with
the piece of driftwood
hanging off his shoulder.

28:23.435 --> 28:25.271
There are other ways
to determine

28:25.304 --> 28:27.173
if the procedure is called for.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.775
No, no escarotomy.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.312
Some of these
are full-thickness burns.

28:33.345 --> 28:36.248
If the blood supply to the hand
is compromised...

28:36.282 --> 28:38.517
No, as long as I can feel
a good radial pulse,

28:38.550 --> 28:40.853
I am not going to let
the surgical "B" Team

28:40.887 --> 28:44.156
start hacking
away at me.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.358
It's possible
the arm could become eschemic.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.895
In which case, it's already
too late to save it.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.296
I know. I get it.
I understand.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.198
Capice.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.001
You should see Corday.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.402
I don't want to see Corday.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.437
At least get
a Plastics assessment.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.173
Will you do that, Robert?

29:04.176 --> 29:05.444
Hi, it's Abby.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.179
Leave me a message
after the beep. Thanks.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.548
Hey, I thought you were going
to be here with Eric.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.417
Dr. Carter.
I was trying to catch you.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.919
Dr. Carter.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.286
I guess
there was a change of plan.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.421
( whistling )

29:15.454 --> 29:16.989
And I'm going
to hang up now,

29:17.023 --> 29:19.291
because you're standing
right in front of me.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.060
Where's Eric?

29:21.093 --> 29:22.361
Upstairs
with Myers.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.830
Are you okay?

29:23.830 --> 29:25.031
Look, I'm
really sorry.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.099
I feel like such
a terrible person.

29:27.133 --> 29:29.135
Yeah, well, it's been
a bad time all around.

29:29.168 --> 29:30.369
CURTIS:
Hey...!

29:30.402 --> 29:32.204
I'm going to
wipe them out!

29:32.238 --> 29:34.073
Look, I swear I
would kill them!

29:34.106 --> 29:36.042
I would do them all,
and I'll take this whole

29:36.075 --> 29:37.109
damn world
with me, man!

29:37.143 --> 29:38.945
You going
to be cool...

29:38.978 --> 29:40.012
I'll take them with me!

29:40.046 --> 29:41.047
...or you want to be
in custody?

29:41.080 --> 29:42.214
I'm cool,
all right?!

29:42.248 --> 29:43.382
I'm cool, man.

29:43.415 --> 29:44.951
Okay, I'll get a suture kit.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.052
Sit.

29:47.887 --> 29:50.189
I'm going to come back later.

29:50.222 --> 29:52.258
Good.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.994
Ain't you
a doctor?

29:55.027 --> 29:56.295
Just a hobby, really.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.865
What's that,
Black Pharaohs?

29:58.865 --> 30:01.033
No, man, Righteous Lords.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.935
How long
you been into that?

30:02.969 --> 30:05.104
I'm not anymore.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.173
I used to run with
them a while before.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.407
I stopped, man. Ah!

30:08.440 --> 30:10.242
Outgrew it?

30:10.276 --> 30:11.477
My mama begged me.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.045
I got a job bagging groceries.

30:13.079 --> 30:14.480
Okay, this will
sting a little.

30:16.916 --> 30:18.050
They were after me.

30:18.084 --> 30:19.852
Who was?
The Dis...

30:19.886 --> 30:21.153
( yelling )

30:21.187 --> 30:23.189
The Disciples, man.
Uh-uh-uh...

30:23.222 --> 30:24.857
They think they own my 'hood.

30:24.891 --> 30:26.325
Probably think
I was an easy target

30:26.358 --> 30:27.994
ever since I left my crew.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.396
So, now Turner, Noelle and Mama,
they paying for it?

30:36.969 --> 30:38.637
Luka, the board's answer
was no.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.606
Oh, this is for
something else.

30:40.639 --> 30:42.909
However,
I convinced them to agree

30:42.942 --> 30:45.111
that if a boy with
no other options

30:45.144 --> 30:47.113
shows up at County
General's doors

30:47.146 --> 30:49.181
in need of an
emergency... repair,

30:49.215 --> 30:51.417
well, he wouldn't
be turned away.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.885
Hypothetically?

30:52.919 --> 30:55.554
And completely off the record.

30:55.587 --> 30:58.157
Kerry, thank you.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.129
( woman
speaking German )

31:03.162 --> 31:05.932
Ladies and gentlemen,
please remain seated.

31:11.437 --> 31:12.939
You are Dr. Kovac?

31:12.939 --> 31:14.440
Yeah.

31:14.473 --> 31:15.942
Base line cyanosis.

31:15.975 --> 31:18.010
...breather
at six liters.

31:35.194 --> 31:39.198
That the X ray
the lady doc was talking about?

31:39.231 --> 31:42.234
Come on, talk to me, man.

31:42.268 --> 31:44.070
She has no return
of her reflexes.

31:44.103 --> 31:46.105
She's having
difficulty breathing.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.074
That could indicate
paralysis.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.041
Will she walk?

31:49.075 --> 31:50.576
If the swelling goes down,

31:50.609 --> 31:53.045
we can put her
on a regimen of
physical therapy.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.646
Will she walk?

31:54.680 --> 31:57.349
I don't know.

32:03.355 --> 32:05.324
Hey, there, baby girl.

32:05.357 --> 32:08.527
Curtis. Mom's okay.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.362
Yeah, I know.

32:10.396 --> 32:12.364
We didn't do
anything.

32:12.398 --> 32:14.333
Why did they shoot at us?

32:14.366 --> 32:15.634
I'm going to go home,

32:15.667 --> 32:17.203
and I'm going
to get things fixed up.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.271
You just stay here
and get better, okay?

32:19.305 --> 32:21.273
Neural ICU's
ready to take her.

32:21.307 --> 32:22.674
When can I visit?

32:22.708 --> 32:24.176
It's open 24 hours.

32:24.210 --> 32:26.112
Am I going to have to stay here?

32:26.145 --> 32:27.346
For a while, yeah.

32:27.379 --> 32:29.281
I can't go home
with you tonight?

32:29.315 --> 32:31.583
No, not tonight,
baby girl, not tonight.

32:31.617 --> 32:34.186
But these folks going
to take care of you.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.155
You try to get some
sleep, all right?

32:39.091 --> 32:40.059
The car is outside.

32:40.092 --> 32:41.327
Are you back?
Yeah.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.661
Too bad it's like this,
though, man.

32:42.694 --> 32:43.529
Where you going, Curtis?

32:43.562 --> 32:45.031
Like I said, fix things.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.665
Yo, they shot up
Jamal's crib, too.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.467
That's not the way
to get it done.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.369
You did a good thing
for your mom.

32:50.402 --> 32:51.370
Don't undo it now.

32:51.403 --> 32:52.371
The Disciples undid it

32:52.404 --> 32:53.505
when they shot up
my family.

32:53.539 --> 32:54.706
Your family needs you.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.408
Yo, Doc...

32:56.442 --> 32:59.378
Hey, Curtis.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.380
Hey, Curtis.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.049
You just didn't
do that, right?

33:03.082 --> 33:04.216
All right, what am I supposed

33:04.250 --> 33:06.052
to tell
that little girl upstairs

33:06.052 --> 33:07.219
when you don't show up?

33:10.489 --> 33:12.458
You tell her I'm a warrior.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.526
You tell her that.

33:23.735 --> 33:26.238
( engine starting )

33:39.785 --> 33:41.120
Sats are falling!

33:41.153 --> 33:42.421
Can't get a good angle!

33:42.454 --> 33:44.190
PVCs, we've got to bag him!

33:44.223 --> 33:45.457
No, will have
to wait!

33:45.491 --> 33:46.692
He's going to go
into arrest!

33:46.725 --> 33:48.194
Let me give it a shot!

33:48.227 --> 33:49.795
I don't think
it's possible!

33:49.828 --> 33:51.330
We do it all the time!

33:51.363 --> 33:53.232
Here,

33:53.265 --> 33:55.101
bag for me!

33:57.103 --> 33:58.404
You've got to get low,

33:58.437 --> 34:01.140
like you're having sex
in a Volkswagen,

34:01.173 --> 34:02.341
you know what I mean?

34:02.374 --> 34:03.542
He's about to go
into V-tach!

34:03.575 --> 34:04.576
Don't miss!

34:04.610 --> 34:05.611
You're a real motivator!

34:05.644 --> 34:07.113
Did anyone ever tell you that?

34:12.251 --> 34:14.286
CORDAY:
Are the bypass tech
and machine ready?

34:14.320 --> 34:15.821
On their way.
Where can I plug in?

34:15.853 --> 34:17.523
Uh, you are?
The echocardiologist.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.257
Kovac promised me
Cubs tickets.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.226
Dr. Corday.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.527
What a pleasant surprise.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.527
Oh, I didn't realize

34:22.561 --> 34:24.263
that Kovac had
recruited you.

34:24.295 --> 34:25.431
He's a persuasive man.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.697
They're three
minutes out.

34:26.732 --> 34:27.799
( hangs up phone )

34:27.833 --> 34:29.268
( helicopter approaching )

34:39.578 --> 34:43.149
( speaking Croatian )

34:43.181 --> 34:44.183
Are they ready?

34:44.216 --> 34:45.417
Standing by
in the OR.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.753
Okay.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.155
Let's roll.

34:50.156 --> 34:52.824
Be careful of the tube.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.693
Bradying down,
looks like 65.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.462
KOVAC:
Half mig of atropine.

34:56.495 --> 34:57.496
Let's keep moving.

34:57.529 --> 34:58.730
No, he might arrest.

34:58.764 --> 34:59.765
Eagle Scout, Doc.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.800
Stats are off
the chart, low.

35:01.833 --> 35:02.901
No pulse.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.903
Okay, starting CPR.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.438
You want epi?

35:06.472 --> 35:08.607
.5 escalating doses.

35:08.640 --> 35:10.376
Okay, pushing it.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.877
...doesn't work.

35:11.910 --> 35:12.911
Nothing works.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.281
I just want his heart
to beat.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.648
I got a pulse.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.817
Okay. Go! Go! Go! Go!

35:20.719 --> 35:22.788
Pressure's only 60
on maximum dopamine.

35:22.821 --> 35:23.722
He needs suctioning.

35:23.755 --> 35:24.756
Where's the CD Team?

35:24.790 --> 35:25.524
They're on
their way in.

35:25.557 --> 35:26.658
You intubated?

35:26.692 --> 35:28.327
Yeah, he's in pulmonary edema.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.229
CORDAY:
All right,
let's get started. Here we go.

35:30.262 --> 35:31.330
Is he stable enough
for general

35:31.363 --> 35:32.498
anesthesia?
I'll scrub in.

35:32.531 --> 35:33.799
KOVAC:
Okay, let's prep the chest.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.201
It's all right, Luka.

35:35.201 --> 35:36.202
We have it.
Porcine pulmonary

35:36.235 --> 35:37.436
valve and Dacron conduit.

35:37.469 --> 35:38.737
Let's get a look
at his coronary

35:38.770 --> 35:39.705
anatomy.
All set.

35:51.817 --> 35:52.884
It's been
a pretty good gig

35:52.918 --> 35:54.220
being married to you,
all in all.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.454
No complaints.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.888
If you ever need a letter
of recommendation.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.890
My resume speaks
for itself.

35:58.924 --> 36:01.693
Is that split move you do,
is that a special skill?

36:01.727 --> 36:03.429
( laughing )

36:03.462 --> 36:05.764
Ah, so...

36:05.797 --> 36:09.701
I guess we'll be running
into each other.

36:09.735 --> 36:12.404
You know, just because
we're splitting up

36:12.438 --> 36:15.307
doesn't mean, you know,
we have to end it.

36:15.341 --> 36:17.243
Makes sense to me.

36:17.243 --> 36:19.611
I hear divorcees
have the best sex.

36:19.645 --> 36:21.413
We're technically annulled,
not divorced.

36:21.447 --> 36:23.482
Work with me here.
I will.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.950
I got a roommate.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.585
That's okay.

36:26.618 --> 36:27.853
I know a bench
in Lincoln Park.

36:27.886 --> 36:30.456
SURGEON:
Are we ready
for bypass?

36:30.489 --> 36:31.723
SURGEON 2:
Ready.

36:31.757 --> 36:34.626
Run up the pump starting
at... 9:37.

36:44.903 --> 36:47.273
There'll be some
outrage at the top

36:47.273 --> 36:48.774
but we'll handle that.

36:48.807 --> 36:49.941
So, he's doing well?

36:49.975 --> 36:51.643
Yeah, stable on bypass.

36:51.677 --> 36:52.944
... pericardium.

36:52.978 --> 36:56.415
SURGEON:
Pump prime gradient
less than ten.

36:56.448 --> 36:59.351
CORDAY:
Low dose epi
at 0.5 started.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.420
Pressure's
up to 120/70.

37:01.453 --> 37:07.726
I thought if I could save him,
it would make me feel...

37:07.759 --> 37:13.865
I don't know, like, uh...
maybe I was a doctor again.

37:16.001 --> 37:19.471
Hey, does this look like
a pubic ramus fracture to you?

37:19.505 --> 37:20.606
No.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.841
Avulsion of the
ischial tuberosity.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.910
Abby's on her way down.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.512
Dr. Romano,
how's it going?

37:26.545 --> 37:27.679
How's what going?

37:27.713 --> 37:28.814
Nothing.

37:28.847 --> 37:29.915
Back to work.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.483
NURSE:
Gallant.

37:31.517 --> 37:32.984
I'm putting Mrs. Mitchell
in One.

37:33.018 --> 37:34.586
I'll be back from Ortho
in a minute.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.355
What's the chest tube
output like?

37:36.388 --> 37:38.490
Less than 50cc's an
hour. Normal sats.

37:38.524 --> 37:40.992
Mrs. Mitchell,
how are you feeling?

37:41.026 --> 37:42.494
Is Curtis here?

37:42.528 --> 37:44.830
He had to go out
for a little while.

37:44.863 --> 37:47.399
He said he'd come back later
for a visit.

37:47.433 --> 37:50.536
You're a doctor.
You dress so nice.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.504
Yeah, I had a funeral.

37:52.538 --> 37:54.940
Somebody close to you?

37:55.907 --> 37:57.476
Yes, ma'am.

37:57.509 --> 37:58.477
Oh, I'm sorry.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.811
Must be hard.

37:59.845 --> 38:01.380
Uh, Turner's doing better.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.515
He's out of surgery
and Noelle is up

38:03.549 --> 38:04.750
in the neuro ICU.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.518
You can see her
tomorrow.

38:06.552 --> 38:09.888
W-Will you wake me up
when Curtis comes back?

38:09.921 --> 38:11.790
I'll make sure
that the doctor knows.

38:13.359 --> 38:15.694
He's a good boy, my Curtis.

38:18.597 --> 38:19.865
How did Kovac
get you on board?

38:19.898 --> 38:21.967
Well, he asked.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.936
Ah. That was easy.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.774
So, what do you
want to do now?

38:28.807 --> 38:30.942
Because, look,
normally, tonight,

38:30.976 --> 38:32.844
I would just be
sitting at home

38:32.878 --> 38:34.513
watching Trading Places.

38:34.546 --> 38:37.949
But fortunately for you,
it's ladies night.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.519
( giggling )

38:40.552 --> 38:43.389
Yeah, you're right.
My daughter's waiting.

38:43.389 --> 38:45.123
I see, well,
have I mentioned

38:45.156 --> 38:48.460
how much I love kids?

38:50.396 --> 38:52.398
My car's just up the street.
You want a ride?

38:56.702 --> 39:00.038
Which way are you going?

39:00.071 --> 39:04.410
Uh... whichever way
you point me towards.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.993
I'm... really sorry, uh...

39:22.027 --> 39:24.663
I-I just can't tonight.

39:24.696 --> 39:28.033
Um... can I take a rain check?

39:32.103 --> 39:35.441
Nice evening
for a stroll.

39:36.742 --> 39:39.110
Lizzie.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.850
How'd it go with Plastics?

39:45.817 --> 39:46.952
What did Gallant do,

39:46.985 --> 39:48.887
post it on the
bulletin board?

39:48.920 --> 39:52.591
No, Plastics consulted me.

39:52.624 --> 39:55.093
They knew that I'd examined
your other infection.

39:55.126 --> 40:00.499
Well, he wants to admit
me for wound care,

40:00.532 --> 40:02.801
daily debridements, and,
uh, pulse monitoring.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.470
And in about a week,
do skin grafts

40:04.503 --> 40:06.137
on the dorsum and
the volar aspect.

40:06.171 --> 40:08.006
Well, that seems reasonable.

40:08.039 --> 40:10.008
Does it?

40:10.041 --> 40:12.844
I was making tea.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.580
I put the pot on.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.815
I, uh, got distracted.

40:16.848 --> 40:21.152
My sling got caught on
the burner and, uh...

40:21.186 --> 40:24.089
my arm was on fire...

40:24.122 --> 40:27.192
and I didn't realize it
until I saw the flames.

40:27.225 --> 40:29.127
It's ridiculous.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.897
Unfortunately, things like that
can happen

40:31.930 --> 40:33.164
during sensory recovery.

40:33.198 --> 40:35.033
Yeah, but I'm not recovering.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.868
I'll never get the feeling back.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.036
Robert, listen to me.

40:38.069 --> 40:39.705
Just because you're discouraged

40:39.738 --> 40:42.007
don't do anything
that might cause a delay.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.909
It's just going to keep going
like this.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.111
You can't afford
to have another infection.
It's over.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.246
Compartment syndrome,
vascular insufficiency...

40:48.279 --> 40:51.016
Lizzie, you're not hearing me.
It's over.

40:53.051 --> 40:56.087
It's time for me
to cut my losses.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.023
Robert...

40:58.056 --> 41:00.091
No, we both know I'll be
better off without it.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.192
You as much as said so.

41:01.226 --> 41:02.661
No, what I said was amputation

41:02.694 --> 41:04.195
was always a possibility
down the line,

41:04.229 --> 41:05.797
but I-I don't think...

41:05.831 --> 41:08.534
I'm very, very glad
we had this chat.

41:12.704 --> 41:16.007
Will you, uh, check
the OR schedule to set it up?

41:16.041 --> 41:17.809
As soon as possible.

41:17.843 --> 41:20.646
I just want to be rid
of the damn thing.

41:28.153 --> 41:29.555
Hey.

41:29.588 --> 41:30.922
Hey.

41:30.956 --> 41:33.091
Have you seen Carter?

41:33.124 --> 41:35.226
Uh, he was
here before.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.563
Everything okay?

41:42.801 --> 41:44.570
Hey, I heard about the boy.

41:44.603 --> 41:45.604
Congratulations.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.573
Thanks.

41:53.244 --> 41:55.180
Okay, see you tomorrow.

41:55.213 --> 41:58.950
Actually, uh,
you won't see me
for a while.

42:00.151 --> 42:01.987
I'm going to the Congo.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.755
What?

42:03.789 --> 42:07.292
The Alliance
de Medicine
Internacionale.

42:07.325 --> 42:08.760
I'm off tomorrow

42:08.794 --> 42:10.996
and then I'm going
to West Africa.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.865
I didn't realize
that was so soon.

42:28.947 --> 42:31.049
Take care of yourself.

42:31.082 --> 42:33.619
I mean it.

42:33.652 --> 42:34.920
Yeah.

42:36.121 --> 42:38.724
Hold down the fort.

42:49.034 --> 42:49.334
She's in the lounge.

42:49.367 --> 42:50.769
Who?

42:50.802 --> 42:52.103
You're not going
to play that, are you?

42:52.137 --> 42:53.639
PARAMEDIC:
GSW to the
chest and back.

42:53.672 --> 42:54.640
PRATT:
No LOC, but
he's altered.

42:54.673 --> 42:55.807
Who's attending?

42:55.841 --> 42:57.075
Uh... Chen's in three
with hot MI.

42:57.108 --> 42:58.644
So, who's going
to take this?

42:58.644 --> 42:59.645
Pratt needs
an attending.

42:59.678 --> 43:00.812
You're an attending.

43:00.846 --> 43:02.247
PARAMEDIC:
BP 90/66 after a liter.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.949
Hey!

43:03.982 --> 43:05.350
Hey, where's Curtis?

43:05.383 --> 43:06.885
I don't know, man.
I don't know.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.186
Was anybody with him?
A bunch of them down.

43:08.219 --> 43:09.821
A couple pronounced
on the scene.

43:09.855 --> 43:10.822
PRATT:
Tachy at 130.

43:10.856 --> 43:11.857
MAN:
I can't breathe.

43:11.890 --> 43:12.858
PRATT:
Lost the pulse.

43:12.891 --> 43:14.025
CARTER:
All right,

43:14.059 --> 43:15.326
start compressions.
Let's go.

43:17.328 --> 43:18.664
No pressure, no pulse.

43:18.697 --> 43:20.131
All right, stop CPR.

43:20.165 --> 43:22.000
I'm in, you bag.
Thoracotomy tray.

43:22.033 --> 43:23.068
Carter, I'm here.

43:23.101 --> 43:24.670
Betadine
and ten blade next.

43:24.703 --> 43:25.937
Jing-Mei's got it.

43:25.971 --> 43:26.938
Come on, Pratt!
Don't just stand there.

43:26.972 --> 43:28.106
Do a central line.

43:28.139 --> 43:29.007
This is my patient.
I got it.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.776
CHUNY:
Still no pulse.

43:30.809 --> 43:32.143
Carter, it's okay.
You don't have to do this.

43:32.177 --> 43:33.311
All right, give me

43:33.344 --> 43:34.846
the ten blade.
John, let them take it.

43:41.019 --> 43:42.788
CHEN:
Fifth intercostal space

43:42.821 --> 43:44.990
all the way
to the mid-axillary line.

43:49.094 --> 43:51.763
ABBY:
Okay, why don't we just
get out of here?

43:51.797 --> 43:54.132
You know I came in
to find you, right?

43:54.165 --> 43:55.801
I shouldn't have
come in here.

43:55.834 --> 43:57.135
I shouldn't have come.

43:57.168 --> 43:58.770
It's okay.
Things are going to get better.

43:58.804 --> 44:00.038
Can you do me a favor?
Yeah.

44:00.071 --> 44:01.272
Can you leave me alone?

44:01.306 --> 44:03.308
What?

44:03.341 --> 44:05.010
I need some time.

44:05.043 --> 44:08.914
Can you just go?

44:08.947 --> 44:10.982
Okay.

44:20.726 --> 44:29.300
( sobbing )
