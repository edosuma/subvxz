( theme music playing )

00:34.962 --> 00:36.795
( lock beeps )

00:36.795 --> 00:39.545
- Man: I've got it. It's okay.
- ( woman laughs )

00:39.545 --> 00:41.254
- ( lock beeps )
- Man: No. Hey!

00:46.170 --> 00:47.295
Yeah.

00:55.254 --> 00:56.920
Is this, uh...

00:58.420 --> 01:00.586
Are you sure this is
the right one?

01:00.586 --> 01:01.962
Uh-huh, yeah.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.795
This--
this is the one.

01:10.586 --> 01:12.545
Well, I don't
recognize anything.

01:12.545 --> 01:14.461
- ( chuckles )
- Well...

01:15.753 --> 01:18.795
Been 56 years,
my love.

01:18.795 --> 01:22.129
- 56 years.
- ( chuckles ) Yeah.

01:22.129 --> 01:24.795
- Oh.
- Mm.

01:24.795 --> 01:27.336
So, um,
which one was it?

01:27.336 --> 01:29.170
Do you remember?

01:32.336 --> 01:36.170
( chuckles )
I don't remember!

01:36.170 --> 01:38.170
Take a guess.

01:38.170 --> 01:39.795
Huh?

01:42.004 --> 01:43.004
Nope.

01:45.087 --> 01:48.545
- ( chuckles )
That one.
- No.

01:48.545 --> 01:50.461
Both of them!

01:50.461 --> 01:52.212
I was an animal!

01:52.212 --> 01:53.962
( bellows )

01:53.962 --> 01:56.378
- ( bellows )
- ( both chuckling )

01:56.378 --> 02:00.336
Well, those days
are over now.

02:00.336 --> 02:03.712
- Mm.
- Uh, ahem, well...

02:03.712 --> 02:05.545
What?

02:05.545 --> 02:07.170
( gasps )

02:07.170 --> 02:11.045
- You didn't.
- ( chuckles ) I did.

02:11.045 --> 02:12.295
W-what happens?

02:12.295 --> 02:14.420
You mean, you just
take one and then you...

02:14.420 --> 02:16.628
( laughing )

02:16.628 --> 02:18.545
- you wait for it
to pop up?
- Yeah.

02:18.545 --> 02:20.212
I took one
half an hour ago.

02:20.212 --> 02:23.753
- Oh, you did not!
- Yes, I did, baby!

02:23.753 --> 02:25.545
Oh, God!

02:25.545 --> 02:27.420
( chuckles )

02:27.420 --> 02:29.420
Well, uh...

02:29.420 --> 02:31.878
( stammering )
We-- it's going to be

02:31.878 --> 02:34.461
a very big day
for us tomorrow

02:34.461 --> 02:40.378
and-- and I'm not
really, you know,
prepared for that.

02:42.378 --> 02:44.753
Uh, it's been
quite a long time...

02:44.753 --> 02:46.336
- Mm.
- ...you know,
and, uh...

02:46.336 --> 02:48.878
Tonight is for us.

02:48.878 --> 02:51.503
Let's-- let's travel
back in time.

02:51.503 --> 02:55.129
Let's be us
56 years ago.

02:55.129 --> 02:57.795
Me and my bride

02:57.795 --> 02:59.920
on our
wedding night.

03:02.045 --> 03:06.878
Oh, I would love to.

03:16.378 --> 03:17.920
Are you okay?

03:17.920 --> 03:20.753
I'm-- I'm okay, yeah.

03:28.503 --> 03:31.378
- ( moans )
- Oh, don't--
don't strain yourself.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.920
No, no, no, no, I'm...
( grunts )

03:33.920 --> 03:35.670
I'm okay.

03:35.670 --> 03:38.962
- I am. I'm okay.
- Yeah? Okay.

03:41.254 --> 03:44.461
May-- maybe I should get
a little more of that stuff...

03:44.461 --> 03:46.170
- No, no, no.
- ...on me.

03:46.170 --> 03:48.837
No, I think--
I think we have enough.

03:48.837 --> 03:51.170
- Yeah?
- ( both groan )

03:52.712 --> 03:54.837
I'm so close.

03:54.837 --> 03:56.586
( chuckles )
I'm so close.

03:56.586 --> 03:59.670
Lorraine:
Is there anything
I can do to help?

03:59.670 --> 04:02.170
- Honey?
- ( moans )

04:03.962 --> 04:06.670
( mumbles, coughs )

04:09.753 --> 04:11.628
( exhales )

04:14.378 --> 04:17.045
Charlie?

04:17.045 --> 04:18.670
Charlie!

04:20.129 --> 04:22.503
Charlie!
( whimpers )

04:35.170 --> 04:37.837
Are you...?

04:37.837 --> 04:39.628
Honey.

04:39.628 --> 04:42.004
- ( grunts )
- Honey?

04:43.378 --> 04:45.628
- ( laughing )
- Oh!

04:45.628 --> 04:48.170
Ooh! You!

04:53.670 --> 04:55.045
Oh.

04:58.212 --> 04:59.670
We tried.

04:59.670 --> 05:02.045
( stammering )
I'm so sorry.

05:02.045 --> 05:04.712
No, we tried.
It's all right.

05:04.712 --> 05:07.336
We were so close!

05:10.712 --> 05:13.212
We weren't that close.

05:13.212 --> 05:15.753
( laughing )

05:20.087 --> 05:23.920
Well, give me
a good smooch, woman.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.712
You've got one.

05:25.712 --> 05:27.920
All right.

05:29.545 --> 05:32.129
- And the Hunan chicken.
- ( TV playing )

05:32.129 --> 05:33.837
( chuckles )
Yeah.

05:33.837 --> 05:37.045
- And, um-- what?
- Soup.

05:37.045 --> 05:40.545
Soup instead
of the egg rolls.

05:42.212 --> 05:43.461
Yep.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.712
About 20 minutes?

05:48.129 --> 05:49.545
Sounds perfect.

05:49.545 --> 05:51.712
Room 104.

05:51.712 --> 05:53.795
Yeah. Okay.

05:53.795 --> 05:55.545
And thank you.

05:55.545 --> 05:57.503
All right.

05:57.503 --> 06:00.586
Woman on TV:
No more struggling to ship
your hard-packed packages.

06:00.586 --> 06:02.628
Order yours now.

06:02.628 --> 06:04.878
- ( crowd cheering )
- It's starting!

06:04.878 --> 06:08.212
Oh, I'm coming!
I just have to do
my little pluck.

06:08.212 --> 06:11.170
Host on TV:
It's time for
"America's..."

06:11.170 --> 06:14.878
So, do you wanna go over
at breakfast in the morning

06:14.878 --> 06:18.878
or do you wanna stay here
and have some quiet time,

06:18.878 --> 06:20.129
just the two of us?

06:20.129 --> 06:21.795
I don't know.

06:21.795 --> 06:23.837
Do you know what
Elaine is serving?

06:23.837 --> 06:24.878
No, I don't.

06:24.878 --> 06:26.461
Can always
call and ask.

06:26.461 --> 06:28.295
No, let's just
eat here.

06:28.295 --> 06:32.129
And I-- and I can
test you again on
your grandkids' names

06:32.129 --> 06:34.212
before we get there.

06:34.212 --> 06:37.295
- Already got that down.
- Oh, you certainly do not.

06:37.295 --> 06:41.004
Listen here, woman,
this mind is like
a steel trap.

06:41.004 --> 06:42.878
( coughing )

06:42.878 --> 06:44.962
Here I come--
great-grandkids.

06:44.962 --> 06:47.129
- You ready?
- Let's hear it.

06:47.129 --> 06:48.878
( chuckles )

06:48.878 --> 06:51.336
Let's see here.
Elaine and Mike,

06:51.336 --> 06:57.295
they have, uh,
Abby, Elliot, and Cara.

06:57.295 --> 07:00.670
And Abby has
Todd and Brad.

07:00.670 --> 07:04.420
Elliot has Ross,
Jen, and Jody.

07:04.420 --> 07:08.129
Cara--
Julian and Jenny.

07:09.461 --> 07:11.586
Oh, yeah, that leaves
Max and Laura.

07:11.586 --> 07:14.837
They just have
the one-- Stephanie.
( chuckles )

07:16.920 --> 07:19.878
I'm missing one.
Who am I missing?

07:21.503 --> 07:23.962
Guess I really wore you out
back there, didn't I?

07:25.378 --> 07:28.045
( game show playing
on TV )

07:31.045 --> 07:32.670
My love?

07:36.878 --> 07:38.503
Lorraine?

07:42.004 --> 07:43.586
My love?

07:51.878 --> 07:54.170
I, uh...

08:00.712 --> 08:04.004
( crying, mumbling )

08:06.087 --> 08:07.712
( grunts )

08:11.503 --> 08:13.170
Lorraine?

08:13.170 --> 08:14.712
Lorraine!

08:14.712 --> 08:15.878
Lorraine?!

08:17.336 --> 08:19.212
Try!

08:19.212 --> 08:21.087
( crying )

08:25.586 --> 08:27.545
( dial tone humming )

08:41.212 --> 08:43.045
Lorraine.

08:59.004 --> 09:01.378
( touch tones beeping )

09:09.295 --> 09:11.295
( line ringing )

09:21.545 --> 09:23.129
Woman over phone:
Hello?

09:25.503 --> 09:27.420
Hello?

09:27.420 --> 09:29.461
Um, it's Dad.

09:29.461 --> 09:32.087
Oh, hey, Dad.

09:32.087 --> 09:33.712
How's the motel?

09:33.712 --> 09:37.045
- It's... good.
- Good.

09:37.045 --> 09:38.336
What's up?

09:40.461 --> 09:42.295
- I'm sorry,
did you say something?
- ( clears throat )

09:42.295 --> 09:46.129
I think my phone
is kind of cutting out,

09:46.129 --> 09:48.004
so let me go outside.

09:54.129 --> 09:57.878
Um, uh...

09:57.878 --> 09:59.670
your mother...

09:59.670 --> 10:02.545
I'm sorry, I think
you're still cutting out.

10:05.503 --> 10:07.545
Your mother, uh...

10:09.545 --> 10:11.628
Dad.

10:11.628 --> 10:13.962
Um...

10:13.962 --> 10:15.795
Are you okay?

10:20.045 --> 10:21.962
Your mother
wants to, uh--

10:21.962 --> 10:25.004
wants to know what you're
serving for breakfast tomorrow.

10:25.004 --> 10:27.461
Oh, I'm just gonna
heat up the quiches

10:27.461 --> 10:30.087
and put out the banana bread
and let the kids do cereals.

10:30.087 --> 10:33.004
Make it easy.
Are you guys gonna come
for breakfast?

10:35.378 --> 10:36.254
Dad?

10:37.920 --> 10:41.962
Um, yeah, I'm just
having trouble,

10:41.962 --> 10:47.837
um, remembering
all the grandkids' names.

10:47.837 --> 10:49.087
Doesn't matter.

10:50.545 --> 10:51.753
Oh, it does.

10:53.378 --> 10:55.087
There's only 15.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.670
Who am I missing?

10:58.670 --> 11:01.212
Oh, Maggie just had
baby Lorraine.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.045
Dad?

11:12.045 --> 11:13.753
Hello?

11:13.753 --> 11:15.420
So, we'll see you
in the morning?

11:16.753 --> 11:19.045
Sure, yeah, right.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.254
I got it.

11:22.712 --> 11:23.920
Thank you.

11:26.586 --> 11:29.295
- I love you, honey.
- Love you, too, Dad.

11:29.295 --> 11:30.753
See you tomorrow.

11:30.753 --> 11:32.795
( disconnect tone
humming )

11:32.795 --> 11:35.670
Bobby on TV:
...and which new square
would you like to go to next?

11:35.670 --> 11:37.670
- Mike on TV: Huh...
- Bobby: Now, you still
have a chance

11:37.670 --> 11:39.795
at that vacation
for two to Hawaii.

11:39.795 --> 11:41.628
- Mike: Up, Bobby. Up.
- Bobby: Here?

11:41.628 --> 11:44.129
- Mike: Yeah, that's it.
- ( crowd cheering )

11:44.129 --> 11:46.336
Bobby:
Oh, no hidden square there.

11:46.336 --> 11:49.420
But we'll have
the next question coming up.

11:49.420 --> 11:51.087
What a game so far!

11:51.087 --> 11:53.420
Everyone's having
a great day.

11:53.420 --> 11:57.129
Now, don't go away.
We'll be right back
after these messages.

11:57.129 --> 11:58.378
( engine revving )

11:58.378 --> 12:00.254
Announcer:
On the race track,

12:00.254 --> 12:02.586
a man is measured
by where he...

12:02.586 --> 12:04.503
( continues indistinctly )

12:08.336 --> 12:11.129
Would you like me to mute
the commercials, my love?

12:14.712 --> 12:16.795
Ah, I agree.

12:16.795 --> 12:20.962
Just a lot of noise
we don't need to hear.

12:22.461 --> 12:23.962
( TV mutes )

12:27.336 --> 12:29.628
Oh, would you like
some wine

12:29.628 --> 12:32.129
if I-- if I pour some?

12:34.129 --> 12:37.212
Or do you wanna
wait till the--

12:37.212 --> 12:39.045
till the food gets here?

13:03.753 --> 13:08.004
This is that wine
from Nancy's son's vineyard.

13:11.378 --> 13:14.212
They said it was fancy,

13:14.212 --> 13:15.712
so I kept it.

13:42.753 --> 13:45.920
It's good.
That is really good.

14:03.420 --> 14:06.378
I used to--

14:06.378 --> 14:10.628
I used to keep a big bag
of Double Stuf Oreos...

14:12.087 --> 14:15.962
in a small, empty slot
behind my sock drawer.

14:19.378 --> 14:21.962
Always wondered if you knew
and just didn't say anything

14:21.962 --> 14:26.045
or if I really
hid it from you.

14:26.045 --> 14:29.586
Well, I needed it.

14:29.586 --> 14:32.586
I know,
bad for me.

14:32.586 --> 14:34.545
I needed
my sugar, though.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.420
Sorry about that.

14:42.837 --> 14:45.795
Oh, yeah, God, I...

14:48.295 --> 14:50.087
I voted
for Goldwater.

14:50.087 --> 14:51.753
I don't know,

14:51.753 --> 14:54.295
I think I thought
he would clean things up,

14:54.295 --> 14:58.461
or end the war, or--

14:58.461 --> 15:02.420
I don't know,
I just-- I don't know
why I lied like that.

15:02.420 --> 15:04.837
I-- I just-- I...

15:06.420 --> 15:09.795
it was just
a dumb thing

15:09.795 --> 15:13.586
and I'm sorry.

15:34.129 --> 15:35.503
( clears throat )

15:36.962 --> 15:39.586
Lorraine.

15:39.586 --> 15:42.712
Lorraine.
( crying )

15:42.712 --> 15:44.628
Lorraine.

15:46.295 --> 15:48.295
Lorraine.

15:50.378 --> 15:51.837
Lorraine.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.837
( screaming )

16:08.837 --> 16:10.712
Ah, God!

16:16.420 --> 16:18.378
I know about Ed.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.004
I do.

16:20.004 --> 16:22.212
I know about Ed!

16:27.045 --> 16:28.420
It's okay.

16:30.753 --> 16:33.503
( crying )
It's okay.

16:36.545 --> 16:38.045
No, it's okay.

16:38.045 --> 16:41.378
It is.
It's-- it's okay.

16:48.336 --> 16:50.129
( grunting )

16:52.087 --> 16:54.962
( crying out )

17:02.837 --> 17:05.295
You didn't know
I knew, did you?

17:07.378 --> 17:09.087
I never...

17:11.420 --> 17:13.295
never told anyone.

17:16.004 --> 17:19.878
Anyway,
Ed came to me
to tell me.

17:23.045 --> 17:25.212
Came to my office.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.586
Wanted to see me
right away.

17:29.545 --> 17:33.503
And I knew,
I just-- I could
feel in my gut

17:33.503 --> 17:36.795
that he was gonna tell me
that he had cancer.

17:36.795 --> 17:38.461
( chuckles )

17:38.461 --> 17:40.461
I just knew it.

17:40.461 --> 17:44.461
So, right when
he walked in the room...

17:45.920 --> 17:49.295
I rushed up
to give him a hug

17:49.295 --> 17:51.004
and he flinched.

17:52.545 --> 17:55.004
He pulled back
at the last second...

17:56.545 --> 17:58.129
like I was
gonna hit him.

17:59.503 --> 18:03.336
And I could see that
he was afraid of me.

18:09.087 --> 18:12.712
Then he sat me down
and he told me what had
been happening with you two...

18:14.670 --> 18:16.212
and how long.

18:19.295 --> 18:24.795
And he told me how he said
he wanted to marry you

18:24.795 --> 18:28.503
and leave Anne.

18:30.837 --> 18:34.004
I-- I thought I was
gonna strangle him,

18:34.004 --> 18:38.004
but I just...

18:39.129 --> 18:40.545
I didn't feel angry.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.295
All I could feel was...

18:50.045 --> 18:51.378
fear.

18:55.503 --> 18:58.878
I simply became
terribly afraid...

19:01.420 --> 19:03.712
that you were--

19:03.712 --> 19:08.586
you were gonna be gone
before I got home that night.

19:10.004 --> 19:13.170
It was the longest day
of my life, Lorraine.

19:19.670 --> 19:23.378
It was a Monday.
I don't know if you
remember that or not.

19:25.586 --> 19:30.045
You made the chicken
or that turkey divan

19:30.045 --> 19:31.878
and the King rolls.

19:31.878 --> 19:36.378
The kids ate early,
went to bed.

19:36.378 --> 19:38.212
I came home
around 9:00.

19:39.545 --> 19:40.753
There you were...

19:42.212 --> 19:44.295
at the dining room table.

19:46.420 --> 19:48.045
You hadn't eaten.

19:50.254 --> 19:52.254
You were
waiting for me.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.628
( exhales )

19:57.628 --> 20:01.545
Well, I didn't know if that was
a good thing or a bad thing.

20:05.254 --> 20:08.503
Well, we talked.

20:08.503 --> 20:10.753
We just talked.

20:10.753 --> 20:15.420
About Elaine,
her new boyfriend.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.129
And, um...

20:19.461 --> 20:24.461
rising prices of--
at the cinema were coming up.

20:26.962 --> 20:28.712
Oh, God, I was
so scared, Lorraine.

20:28.712 --> 20:32.295
I-- I--
I could barely eat.

20:34.461 --> 20:36.170
And then you said it.

20:39.254 --> 20:40.837
I will never
forget it.

20:43.837 --> 20:45.295
"You know, Charlie...

20:46.837 --> 20:49.920
I was thinking,

20:49.920 --> 20:55.336
what if we skipped dinner
with Ed and Anne Saturday night,

20:55.336 --> 20:58.420
went to see a movie,

20:58.420 --> 21:00.670
just the two of us?"

21:08.129 --> 21:11.004
I started to cry.
I don't know if
you saw or not.

21:12.586 --> 21:15.004
I think I hid it from you.
Did you notice?

21:19.795 --> 21:23.503
And I promised myself
right then and there

21:23.503 --> 21:27.461
I would never
bring that up to you

21:27.461 --> 21:29.212
no matter what.

21:32.378 --> 21:36.378
That I would be grateful
that you chose me.

21:43.795 --> 21:46.045
That you chose us.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.545
What made you stay?

22:00.586 --> 22:03.378
I convinced myself
for a long time

22:03.378 --> 22:05.129
that it wasn't important.

22:05.129 --> 22:07.712
I-- I-- it's...

22:08.878 --> 22:11.045
somehow,
now it's like...

22:12.920 --> 22:15.378
it's really important
to me.

22:17.254 --> 22:19.295
( music playing )

22:30.087 --> 22:32.420
If you are here...

22:34.503 --> 22:36.962
if you can
hear me somehow...

22:40.795 --> 22:43.087
would you tell me
the truth?

22:48.962 --> 22:51.254
Did you stay for me?

22:51.254 --> 22:53.753
( music continues )

23:19.628 --> 23:21.586
( crying )

23:25.461 --> 23:26.920
( sniffles )

23:38.170 --> 23:39.670
My love,

23:39.670 --> 23:42.503
I think I will never
understand you.

23:49.503 --> 23:51.336
But I love you.

23:56.170 --> 23:57.962
And I think
that's okay.

23:59.503 --> 24:01.878
( sobs )
I think that's
all right.

24:10.045 --> 24:11.837
It's all right.
