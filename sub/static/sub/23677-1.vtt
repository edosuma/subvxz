03:38.635 --> 03:40.437
Just a little palsy.

- Well, I'm gonna dissolve it.

04:54.557 --> 04:57.160

Yeah, right.

05:07.869 --> 05:10.104
Well, come see if you don't believe me.

05:52.181 --> 05:56.852
The acid's kind of weak, so takes about
a month for the flesh to dissolve.

Why are you doing this?

06:06.061 --> 06:07.883

Yes.

Hey. Dahmer.

57:09.071 --> 57:12.395
I'm Professor Mondale and you're gonna
have a very bright future ahead of you.

57:12.475 --> 57:14.353
Thank you, Son.

57:20.549 --> 57:22.373
How'd it go?

57:23.653 --> 57:25.475
You all right?

57:26.155 --> 57:27.966
It was great.

57:31.260 --> 57:33.332
You know...

57:33.419 --> 57:35.285
...that it has been difficult
with your mother.

57:35.365 --> 57:39.656
I don't want to say anything bad about her.

57:40.436 --> 57:41.947
Just...

57:45.040 --> 57:47.131
Is she going back to the hospital?

57:48.111 --> 57:50.500
Not exactly.

57:50.580 --> 57:52.669
When you were younger...

57:53.749 --> 57:57.541
...but then life gets in the...

57:57.621 --> 58:00.305
I work and...

58:03.312 --> 58:05.899
...so while you were away,
I moved into a motel.

58:05.979 --> 58:08.661
It's just down the block.

58:10.133 --> 58:13.395
I just thought it would be easier...

58:14.104 --> 58:15.976
...while you were away.

58:16.973 --> 58:18.817
You okay?

58:22.211 --> 58:24.023
It'll be amicable.

58:33.421 --> 58:35.303
JOYCE: Hey, kid.

58:36.493 --> 58:39.505
I know you spoke to your dad. You okay?

58:42.731 --> 58:44.242
Aw.

58:52.507 --> 58:54.999
Do you want to talk to somebody about it now?

58:55.279 --> 58:57.934
- JEFF: Hmm.
- Okay.

58:58.014 --> 58:59.858
Get some sleep, honey.

DR. MATTHEWS: Hello.

59:27.944 --> 59:31.207
- You're running a cold, huh?
- I think so.

59:32.282 --> 59:34.360
I've been getting chills.

59:36.352 --> 59:37.870
DR. MATTHEWS: Well...

59:38.787 --> 59:40.851
...it's always good to see your patients.

59:43.859 --> 59:46.138
So, a physical maybe?

59:54.736 --> 59:56.793
Stick out your tongue, say "ah."

59:56.873 --> 59:58.895
JEFF: Ah.

59:58.975 --> 01:00:00.986
Okay. Tonsils look good.

01:00:02.978 --> 01:00:04.700
All right.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:06.992
Turn your head. Let's look in those ears.

01:00:09.651 --> 01:00:11.740
Do you do surgery?

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.344
No.

01:00:14.424 --> 01:00:16.412
Why not?

Turn your head.

01:00:18.728 --> 01:00:21.058
Well, I like caring for people, but...

01:00:21.138 --> 01:00:24.721
...I'm not the type of person who
wants to cut someone open, so this.

01:00:24.801 --> 01:00:27.625
Well, I almost became a podiatrist.

01:00:28.405 --> 01:00:31.194
- Less blood.
- Yeah.

01:00:31.574 --> 01:00:33.139
Exactly.

01:00:34.977 --> 01:00:38.991
- What about what's on a patient's mind?
- You mean a psychiatrist?

01:00:43.051 --> 01:00:45.531
Okay. Just relax, okay?

01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:54.739
Take a deep breath.

01:00:56.932 --> 01:01:00.179
Good. And another deep breath.

01:01:04.806 --> 01:01:07.432
Well, you seem healthy to me.

01:01:08.912 --> 01:01:10.925
Now before I weigh you...

01:01:12.534 --> 01:01:14.606
...does it hurt when you urinate?

01:01:15.018 --> 01:01:16.773
Uh, no.

01:01:16.853 --> 01:01:18.409
Okay.

01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:22.106

01:01:29.565 --> 01:01:31.454
Sort of.

01:01:32.134 --> 01:01:35.804
Well, you're at that age.
Okay. Drop your underpants.

banged your best friend's mom?

You guys haven't actually banged
your best friend's mom, right?

01:03:49.772 --> 01:03:51.527
You're just messing with me.

- I wish I had a best friend.
- Jesus, Dahmer.

01:03:57.046 --> 01:03:59.736

the fridge before my folks get home?

- Just give me one sec.

in your clubhouse kinda creeped me out.

we like about him, right?

the way we treat him is mean?

- No. I...

...I think... I think he seems to enjoy it.

01:04:50.099 --> 01:04:53.156
I think if he didn't want to,
he wouldn't do it. Right?

01:04:53.236 --> 01:04:56.425
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

somehow gotten into a scenario...

representing him and not me.

01:12:25.585 --> 01:12:27.391
You in?

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:34.883
Awesome. You excited?

01:12:34.963 --> 01:12:37.775
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Awesome. Yes!

01:12:41.469 --> 01:12:43.549
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:12:56.852 --> 01:12:59.575
So, is... (INAUDIBLE) coming?

01:12:59.655 --> 01:13:02.310
Uh, yeah. He said he was.

01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:04.580
How about Burowski and Gunsler?

01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:06.749
Oh, Burowski's...

01:13:06.829 --> 01:13:09.766
...Burowski didn't pay. Um...

01:13:09.846 --> 01:13:12.244
...but Gunsler said he was coming.

01:13:20.742 --> 01:13:22.731
Jeez, Dahmer.

01:13:22.811 --> 01:13:25.089
Never seen you drink like that before.

01:13:30.985 --> 01:13:32.864
Here I am.

01:13:53.441 --> 01:13:55.498
Where are we meeting these idiots?

01:13:55.978 --> 01:14:00.458
Um, we're gonna meet them
by the lockers at fatties.

01:14:04.285 --> 01:14:07.843
- Okay, about time.
- Sorry, guys. Money?

01:14:07.923 --> 01:14:10.646
You've got money, money, money?

01:14:10.726 --> 01:14:15.184
- Thank you for coming.
- Here we go. Cash, cash, cash, cash.

01:14:15.864 --> 01:14:18.593
All right, that's about $15. Not bad.

01:14:18.673 --> 01:14:23.058
- Let's get this show on the road.
- All right. I now present to you, Jeff.

01:14:23.138 --> 01:14:24.687
Jeffrey.

01:14:24.767 --> 01:14:26.862
For this, I'm Jeffrey.

01:14:27.042 --> 01:14:30.866
Okay. Then I present to you,
Jeffrey Dahmer...

01:14:30.946 --> 01:14:33.163
- ...in his command performance.
- (APPLAUSE)

01:14:39.386 --> 01:14:41.865
Gladly.

01:15:18.926 --> 01:15:21.050
- JEFF: Hey, man.
- Get off me, man.

01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:22.952
JEFF: It's just my medicine.

01:15:23.632 --> 01:15:25.270
It's just medicine.

01:15:44.986 --> 01:15:47.264
I'm so hungry!

01:16:02.269 --> 01:16:04.893
Hey! Hey, kid. Get out.

01:16:04.973 --> 01:16:07.385
Out. Leave.

01:16:34.735 --> 01:16:36.814
Here I am!

01:17:14.478 --> 01:17:16.032
Hey.

01:17:24.552 --> 01:17:26.431
That was awesome.

01:17:34.462 --> 01:17:36.341
Oh, hi, honey.

01:17:38.165 --> 01:17:40.411
Hey, guess what? The divorce is final.

01:17:43.137 --> 01:17:45.032
Your dad got the house.

01:17:46.442 --> 01:17:48.330
I gotta go to grandma's with your brother...

01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:52.000
...but I need you not to tell your dad that
we're going. Okay, can I count on you to...

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:55.688
...to not tell your dad
that I'm going? For me.

01:17:57.052 --> 01:17:58.930
I won't.

01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:02.029
(DAMHER YELLS)

01:19:33.013 --> 01:19:35.137
NEIL: Dead animals probably
turn up all the time.

01:19:35.217 --> 01:19:39.608
No, this was... this was
a specific incident. It was creepy.

01:19:39.688 --> 01:19:41.177
- And you know what...
- It's not creepy.

01:19:41.257 --> 01:19:44.079
- I bet it was a coh-ven of witches.
- You mean a coven?

01:19:44.159 --> 01:19:45.580
- It's coven?
- Yeah.

01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:49.251
Whatever. There's been a reported
rise in satanic witch cults.

01:19:49.331 --> 01:19:52.187
- According to what? According to who?
- What? Where?

01:19:52.267 --> 01:19:54.056
- Everyone.
- You know what you should do?

01:19:54.136 --> 01:19:57.592
You should get one of the witch cults to wish
in their cauldron to get you a prom date.

01:19:57.672 --> 01:20:00.328
- Piss off.
- Mike's looking for a prom date.

01:20:00.408 --> 01:20:02.731
Oh, yeah, and Derf's planning
to put you up for prom King.

01:20:02.811 --> 01:20:04.533
- No, I'm not.
- It doesn't matter.

01:20:04.613 --> 01:20:08.437
There isn't a girl within 50 miles of the
place who would go to prom with Dahmer.

01:20:09.417 --> 01:20:10.928
No?

01:20:31.071 --> 01:20:34.463
- Bridget. Hello.
- Hi.

01:20:34.543 --> 01:20:37.432
I know we don't know each other too well...

01:20:37.512 --> 01:20:39.568
- BRIDGET: Not really.
- Um...

01:20:39.648 --> 01:20:44.540
...I heard your friend, um,
Margaret was going to the prom?

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:48.443
Yeah, with Bryan Gunsler.
They're friends from debate.

01:20:48.523 --> 01:20:50.613
What are you doing Saturday?

01:20:51.193 --> 01:20:53.416
Some final papers are due.

01:20:53.996 --> 01:20:56.674
Well, do you want to go to prom?

01:20:57.365 --> 01:20:59.888
Oh, with who?

01:20:59.968 --> 01:21:01.524
Me.

01:21:02.204 --> 01:21:04.073
Oh, um...

01:21:05.015 --> 01:21:07.613
- ...I don't know.
- You can go with me...

01:21:07.693 --> 01:21:10.191
...but spend the time with her.

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:14.737
I don't think that's a very good idea.

01:21:15.577 --> 01:21:16.859
Why?

01:21:16.939 --> 01:21:21.217
Look, I'm going to be late for class, so...

01:21:22.057 --> 01:21:23.768
It will be fun.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.786
You're not gonna be weird or... drink?

01:21:30.832 --> 01:21:32.643
No, I won't.

01:21:36.837 --> 01:21:38.527
Look...

01:21:38.607 --> 01:21:40.654
...a lot of upperclassmen...

01:21:40.734 --> 01:21:42.625
...don't know who you are.

01:21:43.311 --> 01:21:45.791
But if you to go to the prom...

01:21:45.871 --> 01:21:48.726
...you will be way ahead
of most of your class.

01:21:52.519 --> 01:21:54.932
You want to seem normal, right?

01:21:57.258 --> 01:21:59.081
I guess.

01:21:59.461 --> 01:22:02.184
A lot of freshmen just want to be asked.

01:22:02.264 --> 01:22:04.909
So it's totally normal that I thought of you.

01:22:08.586 --> 01:22:11.326
I don't know. Just let me think about it?

01:22:11.406 --> 01:22:13.261
I'll talk to my parents.

01:22:13.641 --> 01:22:15.152
Okay.

01:22:24.952 --> 01:22:27.034

01:22:51.812 --> 01:22:55.337
Oh, okay. Just stand in front
of the backdrop for me.

01:22:55.417 --> 01:22:57.428
You guys are my last ones tonight.

01:23:06.526 --> 01:23:08.338
Get closer.

01:23:10.664 --> 01:23:13.122
Don't be scared, she's not gonna bite.

01:23:14.202 --> 01:23:16.213
And smile.

01:23:49.036 --> 01:23:50.859
Oh, look who showed.

01:23:51.839 --> 01:23:54.663
- Unbelievable.
- NEIL: What is?

01:23:54.943 --> 01:23:56.632
Just look.

01:23:57.212 --> 01:23:59.089
Thank you.

01:24:04.385 --> 01:24:06.189
That was sweet.

01:24:07.889 --> 01:24:09.344
I tried.

01:24:09.424 --> 01:24:11.502
Can you get us a drink?

01:24:19.566 --> 01:24:23.024
Dahmer. Hey. It's good to see you here.

01:24:23.104 --> 01:24:24.979
Hey, Neil.

01:24:27.274 --> 01:24:29.690
Hey, I just wanted to...

01:24:30.461 --> 01:24:33.136
...apologize for what happened at the mall.

01:24:34.416 --> 01:24:36.089
You weren't there.

01:24:36.169 --> 01:24:38.950
I know. I couldn't...

01:24:41.596 --> 01:24:43.627
You know, you didn't have to do that.

01:24:46.426 --> 01:24:48.216
It wasn't bad.

01:24:48.296 --> 01:24:49.818
Yeah?

01:24:50.198 --> 01:24:52.154
I don't know. I just...

01:24:52.234 --> 01:24:53.789
Neil.

01:24:54.769 --> 01:24:56.646
I'm sorry.

01:25:33.707 --> 01:25:36.587

your hands around my waist.

- Hi, I'm Penny.

01:25:53.028 --> 01:25:54.831
Um, Bridget.

01:25:56.731 --> 01:25:58.254
Congrats.

01:25:59.434 --> 01:26:01.257
On what?

01:26:02.237 --> 01:26:04.058
We made it.

01:26:04.138 --> 01:26:06.417
Oh, yeah, right.

01:26:14.147 --> 01:26:17.194

art classes over the summer.

exciting, fun things.

01:37:04.665 --> 01:37:06.476

01:37:15.008 --> 01:37:16.886
Sorry, man.

01:37:19.713 --> 01:37:23.193
My mom will just kill me if I don't
get home for dinner on time, so...

01:37:24.118 --> 01:37:27.977
