in high school.

18:21.068 --> 18:23.689
Like, it tastes so good,
and you keep having it,

18:23.758 --> 18:26.206
and then you wake up
on the grass the next day.

18:26.275 --> 18:27.517
And you're like, ",
what happened?"

18:32.586 --> 18:33.827
Yeah, 10:00,
I'm gotta go get ready.

18:33.896 --> 18:35.482
I gotta shave.I have a question.

18:35.551 --> 18:37.344
What, how did your armpits
get so sweaty?
I don't know.

18:37.413 --> 18:39.724
Why are you raising your hand
like you're in school?

18:39.793 --> 18:41.137
If Sam did come here,

18:41.206 --> 18:42.724
like, what would it have
been like for you two?

18:42.793 --> 18:44.034
Yeah.

18:44.103 --> 18:45.620
Would you have legit
let her just do her

18:45.689 --> 18:47.379
in the house, or would
you have ragged
a little bit?

18:47.448 --> 18:48.551
What do you mean?
Ragged about what?

18:48.620 --> 18:49.862
I have a kid on the way.

18:49.931 --> 18:51.344
You think I give a
what she does?

18:51.413 --> 18:52.896
Are you ragging on her
with the doll

18:52.965 --> 18:54.137
just because
she's not here?

18:54.206 --> 18:56.379
I would do it
if she was here.

18:56.448 --> 18:59.206
Hearing Ron talk about Sam
is giving me flashbacks

18:59.275 --> 19:02.137
of, like, back to their
torturous relationship.

19:02.206 --> 19:04.620
It's like I'm a battered child
remembering my past.

19:04.689 --> 19:06.827
There would have been
a division in the house.

19:06.896 --> 19:08.724
And you would have been
on her side, so...

19:08.793 --> 19:10.034
Me and her were
always closer.

19:10.103 --> 19:12.655
Oh, she's-- she's
a  titty-sucker.

19:12.724 --> 19:15.034
Deena and Ron
are fighting over Sam.

19:15.103 --> 19:18.103
I'm like, "Oh, ,
it's happening again."

19:18.172 --> 19:20.551
Is it gonna be this way
the whole time?

19:20.620 --> 19:23.413
When me and her dated,
she never talked to you,

19:23.482 --> 19:25.275
she never talked to you,
she never talked to you.

19:25.344 --> 19:26.724
She talked to me.Not really.

19:26.793 --> 19:28.655
Ooh!Not the way
she talks to you now

19:28.724 --> 19:30.034
and she talked to you
after we broke up.

19:30.103 --> 19:31.275
That's a fact.
That's true.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.034
It's a dead-up
fact.

19:33.103 --> 19:35.241
Ron needs to stop talking
about Sam and, like,

19:35.310 --> 19:36.827
move the  on.

19:36.896 --> 19:40.137
Sam told me that he used to
call her on blocked numbers

19:40.206 --> 19:42.620
and used to, like,
be really weird.

19:42.689 --> 19:44.482
She was afraid she was gonna
get in the house

19:44.551 --> 19:46.862
and he would get drunk
and spiral

19:46.931 --> 19:48.482
and try and get back
with her or something.

19:48.551 --> 19:53.000
Me and her really do
have a good friendship.
She did talk to me.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.413
Anyway, I think she's
hanging with Angelina now.

19:54.482 --> 19:56.793
That's what I heard.

20:00.551 --> 20:01.965
You all right?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.862
Your face looks like
you're not okay.

20:03.931 --> 20:05.413
No, 'cause I'm annoyed.

20:05.482 --> 20:07.689
Yeah, you literally
are like this.

20:07.758 --> 20:10.068
Deena's very defensive
when it comes to Sam.

20:10.137 --> 20:11.344
And by doing that,
she's starting

20:11.413 --> 20:12.965
to pick fights with Ron.

20:13.034 --> 20:14.517
But right now,
let's end this .

20:14.586 --> 20:17.344
Go out and like full-on rage.

So this Colombian girl,

38:12.482 --> 38:14.241
I think she partied too hard,

38:14.310 --> 38:16.448
and now it's all
hitting her at once.

38:16.517 --> 38:18.965
She's stumbling,
her eyes are bugged out.

38:19.034 --> 38:20.241
She doesn't even know
where she is.

38:20.310 --> 38:21.862
I'm sorry.No, it's fine.

38:21.931 --> 38:24.206
I've got you.

38:24.275 --> 38:26.068
I'm so embarrassed.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.172
Listen, I've been
there, bitch.

38:28.241 --> 38:30.655
Bitch, I'm Snooki.
I've been there.

38:30.724 --> 38:32.517
I'm trying to take care
of her 'cause I feel bad,

38:32.586 --> 38:33.482
'cause I feel like
this is my fault.

38:33.551 --> 38:35.896
Just sit, sit.

38:35.965 --> 38:39.620
Oh, you're throwing up?
Oh, she's dying.

38:39.689 --> 38:40.965
Damn, what happened?

38:41.034 --> 38:42.724
She's dying.

38:42.793 --> 38:43.931
Colombiana,
you okay?

38:44.000 --> 38:45.103
She's-- She--

38:45.172 --> 38:46.103
I'm like-- Oh!

38:46.172 --> 38:48.172
Oh, my goodness.Ooh!

38:48.241 --> 38:53.413
Holy ,
she's projectile.

38:53.482 --> 38:56.793
Oh, my God.
This totally backfired.

38:56.862 --> 38:58.931
I hope she doesn't die,
'cause if she does die,

38:59.000 --> 39:02.517
I made the drink, and I'm
going to jail for murder.

39:02.586 --> 39:04.000
I'm thinking
we need a medic.

39:06.206 --> 39:08.103
No, you're fine.
Breathe.

39:10.517 --> 39:14.000
No, don't move, don't move.
Don't-- Ooh!

39:14.068 --> 39:16.896
Trust me... You're gonna be
absent for that class.

39:16.965 --> 39:18.862
Don't-- Don't move,
don 't move.

39:18.931 --> 39:21.413
Ooh, God.
Whoa!

39:21.482 --> 39:23.482
Here, put this on.Whoa.

39:23.551 --> 39:26.793
You have throw-up
everywhere... Oh, God.

39:26.862 --> 39:29.689
I'm trying to get the puke
out your hair.

39:29.758 --> 39:31.896
Where's Ronnie?

39:31.965 --> 39:34.137
It was fun hanging
here out with you.

39:34.206 --> 39:37.862
Like, it was a pleasure.
Had a good time.

39:39.448 --> 39:42.862
You're beautiful.
Like, you are... gorgeous.

39:42.931 --> 39:45.517
Like...

39:45.586 --> 39:47.275
You would get me
into a lot of trouble.

39:47.344 --> 39:48.758
I don't see your house.

39:48.827 --> 39:51.689
Why you don't-- you don't--
I don't see your house?

39:51.758 --> 39:53.137
You wanna see the house?I want to see it.

39:53.206 --> 39:54.931
All right,
I'll show you the house.

39:55.000 --> 39:58.793
Before I leave.

39:58.862 --> 40:01.862
Ronnie is, like, one step

40:01.931 --> 40:04.655
above playing with fire right
now, you know what I'm saying?

40:04.724 --> 40:08.034
Like, it was cute in the club.
It was funny.

40:08.103 --> 40:09.931
He might have flirted
with the line, but to me,

40:10.000 --> 40:11.724
like, he's taking it
way too far right now.

40:11.793 --> 40:13.655
That's the throw-up
situation.

40:15.620 --> 40:17.137
That's the kitchen.

40:17.206 --> 40:19.034
That's my fake
ex-girlfriend.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.034
And we're going
all the way upstairs.

40:24.103 --> 40:27.827
Just be careful.
Very tricky stairs.

40:27.896 --> 40:32.206
This is my room...
right here.

40:32.275 --> 40:35.620
This is the bathroom.

40:35.689 --> 40:37.758
I wonder
if this door works.

40:41.689 --> 40:45.655
Did he bring
the girl upstairs?I think so.

40:45.724 --> 40:48.137
If Ronnie does anything
French right now,

40:48.206 --> 40:49.620
it should be "au revoir."

40:49.689 --> 40:51.689
Like, goodbye,
get out of this house,

40:51.758 --> 40:54.137
you do not want to do this.

40:59.379 --> 41:01.724
Yo, Ron.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.379
No, thank you.
