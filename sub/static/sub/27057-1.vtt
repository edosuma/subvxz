03:44.210 --> 03:46.070
Follow me.

03:47.776 --> 03:49.160
W-Where are you taking me?

04:29.170 --> 04:31.668
What? Where are you going?

04:31.688 --> 04:34.090
They'll kill me! They'll kill me!

04:34.110 --> 04:35.655
Let me out!

04:35.675 --> 04:37.120
Don't leave me here!

05:17.070 --> 05:18.210
Stop!

05:19.135 --> 05:21.030
Diver!

05:21.554 --> 05:23.010
You can't have him!

05:23.030 --> 05:24.411
It's over, Nikolai.

05:24.431 --> 05:26.050
Not for us.

05:26.070 --> 05:28.040
Never.

05:54.797 --> 05:56.080
Who are you?

06:46.060 --> 06:49.020
<i>Henrik would have never seen the dawn.</i>

06:49.040 --> 06:53.020
<i>KGB would have sooner slit
his throat than see him free.</i>

07:00.020 --> 07:02.170
Okay. Let's get you home.

07:02.190 --> 07:04.130
Come on.

07:04.615 --> 07:08.000
<i>Instead, he returned to Estonia.</i>

07:08.020 --> 07:10.000
<i>Their own Mandela.</i>

07:10.020 --> 07:13.120
<i>Expelled the Soviets,
declared independence,</i>

07:13.666 --> 07:16.220
<i>and led them to the promised land.</i>

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
<i>Diver risked his life
that night to save Henrik,</i>

07:21.020 --> 07:23.200
<i>but he also had his own agenda.</i>

07:24.184 --> 07:25.326
<i>More on that later.</i>

07:31.306 --> 07:33.226
Happy birthday.

07:33.246 --> 07:34.286
Thank you.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.220
Yeah. That's right.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.426
July 4th.

07:43.446 --> 07:45.446
Happy birthday.

07:46.226 --> 07:47.968
Happy birthday to your sad,

07:47.988 --> 07:50.426
fading former superpower of a country.

07:51.176 --> 07:53.166
I'll show you a superpower.

07:59.206 --> 08:00.493
You know what...

08:00.493 --> 08:03.493
We need to play it cool at the barbecue.

08:03.513 --> 08:04.593
Tonight.

08:05.009 --> 08:07.653
Strictly professional. Hands off, okay?

08:07.673 --> 08:10.623
I-I can't... I can't promise anything.

08:16.523 --> 08:18.453
Seriously?

08:18.473 --> 08:20.418
I mean, nonstop since you found this guy.

08:20.443 --> 08:22.981
Y-You don't actually think
he was CIA, do you?

08:23.443 --> 08:26.247
I don't know. A lot
of what he says sounds legit.

08:26.267 --> 08:27.613
Listen to this.

08:27.633 --> 08:30.925
<i>He was the CIA's
go-to wetworks man in Berlin</i>

08:30.945 --> 08:35.472
<i>from '83, '84...
up to the fall of the wall.</i>

08:35.493 --> 08:36.503
Those dates.

08:36.523 --> 08:37.533
<i>Diver was the best.</i>

08:37.553 --> 08:38.613
Diver would have been the one.

08:38.633 --> 08:40.503
Daniel, please.

08:40.523 --> 08:43.623
<i>And then he just disappeared...</i>

08:44.131 --> 08:46.453
<i>like smoke.</i>

08:51.463 --> 08:52.503
Now you're talking.

08:55.643 --> 08:57.603
For your information...

08:57.623 --> 08:59.453
I will gladly postpone

08:59.473 --> 09:01.463
my 9:00 a.m. meeting
with the undersecretary

09:01.483 --> 09:03.513
for breakfast in bed with you.

09:11.533 --> 09:15.513
You know the BfV probably still
has the Stasi file on Diver

09:15.533 --> 09:17.523
in the archives somewhere.

09:20.463 --> 09:22.473
I know why you're doing this.

09:22.493 --> 09:23.613
I get it.

09:24.088 --> 09:27.603
But wanting something to be true
doesn't make it so.

09:33.390 --> 09:34.932
The years line up.

09:35.543 --> 09:37.593
Berlin would have been
his hunting ground.

09:43.938 --> 09:46.543
You think Diver killed your mother?

09:46.563 --> 09:49.503
She was killed with
Lukas Becker, who was a traitor.

09:49.523 --> 09:51.493
CIA wanted him dead.

09:53.909 --> 09:55.244
Please.

09:56.283 --> 09:57.603
As a favor for me.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.976
That's a red line I can't cross.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.603
Okay.

10:08.010 --> 10:10.051
Oh, fuck it. Now <i> I</i> need to know.

10:11.052 --> 10:13.633
I'll find out if Diver was real.

10:17.643 --> 10:21.103
Oh, I got a... I got a surprise for you.

10:22.493 --> 10:24.226
Happy birthday.

10:24.246 --> 10:27.254
- Thank you.
- 'Cause I know you like presents.

10:27.274 --> 10:28.653
I do.

10:28.673 --> 10:30.731
I'm afraid.

10:30.751 --> 10:32.543
- It'll blow your mind.
- Yeah?

10:35.633 --> 10:37.613
I love it. Thank you.

10:37.633 --> 10:40.018
- I got some bad news for you now.
- What?

10:40.038 --> 10:41.513
You're not gonna make your 9:00 a.m.

11:15.523 --> 11:16.493
Hey.

11:35.563 --> 11:37.389
No. No.

11:37.409 --> 11:38.449
Hey, Robert.

11:38.469 --> 11:40.623
Fuck you, you fucking fuck!

11:40.643 --> 11:42.503
Okay.

11:42.523 --> 11:44.296
- Okay.
- Okay, I love you, too.

11:44.316 --> 11:47.463
Good morning, Chief. Happy Fourth.

11:54.443 --> 11:56.443
<i> Chief, I have COS Warsaw</i>

11:56.463 --> 11:57.523
<i>for you on the green line.</i>

11:57.543 --> 11:58.643
Thank you.

12:01.623 --> 12:02.653
Karen.

12:02.673 --> 12:04.593
How are the Poles treating you?

12:04.613 --> 12:06.556
<i>Good. Good.</i>

12:06.576 --> 12:08.986
<i>Listen, Val, I just got a call
you need to know about</i>

12:09.006 --> 12:12.523
<i>from Rafael Torres,
who's alone in Tallinn Station.</i>

12:12.543 --> 12:15.583
<i>Says Russia's making a move on Estonia.</i>

12:15.603 --> 12:17.563
Well, I haven't heard
anything about that,

12:17.583 --> 12:19.593
but nationalists and Ethnic Russians

12:19.613 --> 12:22.182
being at each other's throats
is nothing new, is it?

12:22.202 --> 12:25.777
<i>He claims that advanced Russian
forces are already embedded.</i>

12:25.797 --> 12:27.170
<i>We'd like to hand it off to you.</i>

12:27.190 --> 12:28.493
Is this about Henrik Viiding?

12:28.513 --> 12:30.624
<i>He's back on his soapbox,
inciting the nationalists,</i>

12:30.644 --> 12:33.523
<i>and he'll have a big stage at
their Centennial celebration.</i>

12:33.664 --> 12:36.190
***

12:36.490 --> 12:38.483
<i>Nobody can fault him
for loving his country,</i>

12:38.503 --> 12:39.943
<i>but he's got blinders on.</i>

12:39.963 --> 12:42.523
You know, Berlin Station
bailed him out 30 years ago.

12:42.543 --> 12:44.623
Please don't tell me that
we're still his safe keeper.

12:44.643 --> 12:46.523
<i>Mm, I'm afraid so.</i>

12:46.543 --> 12:48.673
<i>You may need to go in and talk him down.</i>

12:49.453 --> 12:50.483
<i>NATO is worried...</i>

12:50.503 --> 12:52.563
<i>one of its own in Russia's cross hairs.</i>

12:53.047 --> 12:54.563
<i>This is how it started in the Ukraine.</i>

12:54.583 --> 12:57.533
<i>One good poke in the eye,
and Estonia's next.</i>

12:57.553 --> 12:58.673
Okay, Karen.

12:59.189 --> 13:00.463
We'll take it from here.

13:00.483 --> 13:02.810
Next time you're in town,
don't you dare forget

13:02.830 --> 13:04.270
that you owe me a drink.

13:04.290 --> 13:05.593
<i>Happy Fourth, Val.</i>

13:05.613 --> 13:07.553
You too.

15:48.543 --> 15:50.208
Gunnar, Gunnar, Gunnar.

16:08.503 --> 16:09.603
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

16:09.623 --> 16:11.563
Nyea, nyea.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

18:02.563 --> 18:05.603
Nice place. It's very swank.

18:07.463 --> 18:08.573
You've been here before, haven't you?

18:08.593 --> 18:10.523
- No. Never.
- No?

18:10.543 --> 18:12.443
Well, I'm glad you're here now.

18:12.463 --> 18:14.603
Irasshaimase, everybody!

18:14.623 --> 18:17.483
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, Happy Fourth!

18:17.503 --> 18:18.523
Happy 4th of July.

18:18.543 --> 18:20.503
Okay, I got something for you.

18:20.523 --> 18:21.573
- Oh.
- Uh...

18:24.573 --> 18:25.563
Fuck.

18:27.543 --> 18:30.463
Yeah, your Japanese is no bueno.

18:30.483 --> 18:31.633
Okay, well, that was a haiku.

18:31.653 --> 18:34.443
And four years at Tokyo Station,
I'll be dreaming in Japanese.

18:34.463 --> 18:35.533
Okay. And I'll be there to visit

18:35.553 --> 18:38.094
because the wasabi Kit Kats are the best.

18:38.114 --> 18:39.563
You better.

18:39.583 --> 18:40.603
Cheers.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.643
Um, what the hell are
those two trying to prove?

18:45.663 --> 18:48.623
Who the hell do they think
they're fooling?

18:48.643 --> 18:50.533
Are we supposed to play along that

18:50.553 --> 18:52.473
- we don't know they're a thing?
- Yeah, I think we are.

18:52.493 --> 18:53.958
- Oh, hi.
- What?

18:53.978 --> 18:55.573
Oh, come on. We just bumped
into each other in the elevator.

18:55.593 --> 18:56.573
Give me a beer.

18:58.473 --> 19:00.593
Happy 4th of July.

19:02.151 --> 19:04.503
Mm. It's good.

19:04.523 --> 19:07.643
I just got a night action from Estonia.

19:07.663 --> 19:09.593
Ethnic Russians and Free Estonians

19:09.613 --> 19:12.009
are at each other's throats again.

19:12.583 --> 19:15.673
The situation on the ground
is very unstable.

19:16.453 --> 19:18.553
But why are we getting a distress
call from Tallinn Station?

19:18.573 --> 19:21.193
Because they're understaffed.

19:21.213 --> 19:23.593
Practically shut down.

19:23.613 --> 19:26.533
There's just one guy there...
named Torres.

19:49.663 --> 19:55.483
Happy Fourth of July, motherfuckers!

19:59.623 --> 20:01.553
Oww!

20:05.513 --> 20:06.583
Now strong finish!

20:06.603 --> 20:09.483
Strong finish! Everybody in the back!

20:44.663 --> 20:46.443
It's okay.

20:46.463 --> 20:47.623
It's okay, friend.

20:52.623 --> 20:55.493
Yeah, well, Henrik Viiding is
making noises again

20:55.513 --> 20:57.603
about pulling down Soviet monuments.

20:57.623 --> 20:59.443
I get it. If I had to walk past

20:59.463 --> 21:01.866
Robert E. Lee statues every day,
I'd want to raise hell, too.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.132
You know we didn't save
that motherfucker's ass

21:04.152 --> 21:06.553
from a Stasi jail cell
that night just to get pulled

21:06.573 --> 21:09.463
into a shooting war
with Russia 30 years later.

21:10.127 --> 21:13.116
Daniel, Robert, I want you both
to go to Tallinn tomorrow,

21:13.136 --> 21:15.653
and I want you to rendezvous with Torres.

21:15.673 --> 21:17.593
And I want you to tell Henrik Viiding

21:17.613 --> 21:20.673
to keep his hands off
those Russian war memorials.

21:21.034 --> 21:22.603
Don't poke the bear.

21:22.623 --> 21:26.523
Big wars...
they can start in small places.

22:42.463 --> 22:45.553
Happy Fourth of July, motherfucker.

22:54.279 --> 22:58.299
She's an agent of a foreign
intelligence service, Daniel.

22:59.493 --> 23:01.613
You know what you have to do.

23:01.633 --> 23:03.563
- Valerie...
- No.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.200
No, don't.

23:06.099 --> 23:07.661
Known for a long time.

23:11.493 --> 23:13.573
I'm actually very happy for you.

23:15.663 --> 23:18.493
I'll clear her as soon
as I get back. I promise.

23:19.533 --> 23:21.513
Excuse me.

23:21.533 --> 23:24.593
So, uh, Estonia is
your last mission out of Berlin.

23:24.613 --> 23:27.583
You know what?
As a matter of fact, it is.

23:29.603 --> 23:31.756
Valerie. We'll get him to listen.

23:31.776 --> 23:33.553
Don't worry.

23:33.573 --> 23:35.673
I'm counting on it.

23:36.235 --> 23:38.493
- Hi!
- Esther.

23:38.513 --> 23:40.245
Thank you so much for coming.

23:40.265 --> 23:41.945
Thank you for having me.

23:42.393 --> 23:44.531
It really suits you, you know.

23:45.330 --> 23:47.250
What, this? No, it's ancient.

23:47.275 --> 23:49.355
No. Being in charge.

23:49.583 --> 23:51.580
You make it look easy.

23:52.303 --> 23:54.443
Well, you're not exactly wilting
under the pressure, either.

23:54.468 --> 23:56.288
Let's have a toast.

23:56.313 --> 23:58.353
What are we toasting to?

23:58.476 --> 23:59.556
America.

23:59.581 --> 24:01.461
- To family.
- To family.

24:01.563 --> 24:03.099
- Cheers.
- Come on!

24:03.119 --> 24:05.643
- Cheers.
- Prost. Prost. Prost.

24:05.663 --> 24:08.553
Look... the embassy fireworks.
Here we go.

24:08.573 --> 24:11.563
Beautiful!

24:11.583 --> 24:13.623
- Hey
- Hey.

24:16.303 --> 24:17.373
Diver.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.613
He was real.

24:22.069 --> 24:23.673
Did you get his file?

24:24.277 --> 24:25.910
Lost when the wall came down.

24:26.291 --> 24:28.116
Lost or taken?

24:29.201 --> 24:30.523
I don't know.

24:32.037 --> 24:34.706
Maybe Henrik knows.
I'll ask him tomorrow.

25:52.503 --> 25:54.493
- Howdy.
- Hi.

26:15.553 --> 26:17.523
- Where are you going?
- Upstairs.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.244
We were told Torres would be waiting.

26:19.269 --> 26:21.349
Hmm. No one's up there. Station's empty.

26:21.543 --> 26:22.583
So, where is he?

26:30.593 --> 26:32.593
What is this, Marine? Why is he off-site?

26:32.613 --> 26:35.483
It's a need-to-know basis, and I don't.

26:35.503 --> 26:36.884
It's not far... down by the water.

26:36.904 --> 26:38.914
- Do you know this guy?
- Know him some.

26:38.934 --> 26:39.994
And?

26:42.663 --> 26:44.573
Beautiful.

27:19.543 --> 27:21.493
Well, this is it.

27:21.513 --> 27:23.463
Why is he meeting us in a safehouse?

27:40.593 --> 27:42.593
Over here!

27:42.613 --> 27:44.583
Come on up!

28:07.543 --> 28:09.483
You got to be shitting me.

28:09.503 --> 28:10.636
Damn!

28:10.656 --> 28:12.663
It's nice to see some friendlies.

28:14.603 --> 28:16.912
- Torres.
- What the fuck is this?

28:17.443 --> 28:18.503
Fuck you doing here?

28:18.972 --> 28:20.523
The beefy motherfucker in the chair

28:20.543 --> 28:22.483
beaten to a pulp behind me.

28:22.503 --> 28:23.893
Oh, you mean him?

28:25.453 --> 28:26.503
Ebony to my ivory.

28:26.523 --> 28:28.189
Who signed off on this?

28:29.428 --> 28:30.418
<i>I</i> did.

28:30.443 --> 28:32.483
What the fuck's the matter with you?

28:32.503 --> 28:33.739
We need to see your COS.

28:33.759 --> 28:35.443
Uh, he's in Tampa.

28:35.463 --> 28:38.383
Three-bedroom off the seventh
green, living the dream.

28:38.408 --> 28:39.418
Oh, buddy.

28:39.443 --> 28:42.453
You've gone way the fuck
upriver, haven't you?

28:52.936 --> 28:54.108
Fingertips.

28:59.603 --> 29:01.473
They're burned off.

29:04.859 --> 29:05.899
Hmm?

29:12.653 --> 29:14.583
No Russian.

29:14.603 --> 29:16.523
No speak.

29:16.543 --> 29:18.493
This man is wrong.

29:18.513 --> 29:19.543
He's crazy.

29:19.563 --> 29:21.300
Yeah, I'd have to concur.

29:21.443 --> 29:23.386
The Russians are already making a move.

29:23.453 --> 29:25.483
Little green men in Estonia.

29:25.503 --> 29:29.002
Saw a ghost in the street two weeks ago,

29:29.022 --> 29:30.583
set up surveillance.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.712
Haven't seen him since.

29:33.473 --> 29:36.007
The guy's name is Sergei Basarov.

29:36.503 --> 29:39.483
Know him from Homs and Aleppo.

29:39.503 --> 29:40.643
Sniper.

29:41.054 --> 29:42.593
Took out some good people.

29:42.613 --> 29:44.453
Russian Special Forces?

29:44.473 --> 29:46.653
Spetsnaz. No doubt.

29:47.060 --> 29:48.603
The Russians are already here.

29:49.020 --> 29:50.663
How'd you find this charmer?

29:51.443 --> 29:54.265
Oh, I separated him from the herd.

29:54.285 --> 29:55.453
Set up a trap.

29:55.473 --> 29:57.070
Yeah? What did you use to bait him?

29:57.333 --> 29:58.323
Me.

29:58.463 --> 30:01.573
The chance to stomp a drunk American.

30:01.593 --> 30:04.603
The bar where I found him
was full of Ethnic Russians.

30:04.623 --> 30:07.206
No one would pass that up.

30:07.226 --> 30:11.513
So, you bagged this guy
because he <i> didn't</i> kick your ass?

30:11.533 --> 30:14.513
He showed military discipline
by staying out of it.

30:14.533 --> 30:16.673
He was the only one who laid back.

30:17.453 --> 30:19.443
And he was the only one
who wasn't wearing

30:19.463 --> 30:20.775
a St. George ribbon.

30:20.795 --> 30:23.503
Because he <i> wasn't</i> wearing
a pro-Russian ribbon,

30:23.523 --> 30:25.543
you think that he was Russian?

30:28.473 --> 30:30.563
They love playing games.

30:38.099 --> 30:41.443
This says he's Estonian.
Says his name's Juho Spota.

30:41.463 --> 30:42.553
Have you checked him out?

30:42.573 --> 30:44.603
- Yep.
- And...

30:44.623 --> 30:45.623
It's valid.

30:47.290 --> 30:49.390
I am metalworker.

30:49.563 --> 30:51.453
I am metalworker!

30:51.473 --> 30:52.739
Metalworker. I am metalworker.

30:52.759 --> 30:55.493
Okay. We're out of here.
We're gonna go talk to Henrik.

30:55.513 --> 30:57.672
When we get back, this guy's gone.

30:58.553 --> 30:59.633
Say it.

31:01.092 --> 31:03.052
I need to hear you say it.

31:03.523 --> 31:05.573
I'll release him.

31:11.643 --> 31:13.469
But I'm not wrong!

31:31.513 --> 31:35.523
With all due respect, you
need to listen to us, Henrik.

31:35.543 --> 31:36.573
Ohh.

31:44.094 --> 31:46.428
Just leave the fucking monuments
alone, Henrik.

31:46.453 --> 31:49.275
You have to try this.
Best compote in Tallinn.

31:49.295 --> 31:50.475
I'm...

31:51.493 --> 31:53.513
Thank you, Henrik.

31:53.533 --> 31:54.533
Delicious.

31:54.553 --> 31:56.553
At the Centennial tomorrow,

31:56.573 --> 31:58.553
we need your people to stand down.

31:58.573 --> 32:00.543
Do you know what you're asking?

32:00.563 --> 32:04.573
That monument canonizes
our oppressors, our murderers.

32:04.593 --> 32:07.032
29 years ago, we chased the Russians out,

32:07.052 --> 32:08.543
but in their minds, they never left.

32:08.563 --> 32:09.925
For '89, Henrik.

32:09.945 --> 32:12.543
For all we've done for you, you owe us.

32:12.563 --> 32:14.443
Emotions are raw.

32:14.463 --> 32:16.643
We need you to leave
the monuments untouched.

32:16.663 --> 32:18.453
The Kremlin is watching.

32:18.473 --> 32:19.543
Oh, fuck the Kremlin.

32:19.563 --> 32:20.563
Thank you, dear.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.523
Fine. Fuck the Kremlin.

32:22.543 --> 32:24.563
But don't think for a second
they'll eat shit

32:24.583 --> 32:26.483
while you humiliate them.

32:26.503 --> 32:29.583
"We will protect every NATO ally."

32:29.603 --> 32:31.443
President Obama's words

32:31.463 --> 32:32.593
delivered right here on the Square.

32:32.613 --> 32:34.603
He promised the U.S.
would come to our defense.

32:34.623 --> 32:37.443
He sat right where you are sitting
and promised me personally.

32:37.463 --> 32:38.523
Yeah, well, that was a lifetime ago.

32:38.543 --> 32:39.742
The world has changed,

32:39.767 --> 32:41.453
and so has America.

32:42.653 --> 32:43.986
You all right?

32:44.453 --> 32:46.553
No. I haven't been right lately.

32:46.573 --> 32:49.107
My wife is dragging me
on holiday after Centennial.

32:49.127 --> 32:50.613
So, do we have your word about tomorrow?

32:50.633 --> 32:53.473
Lead your people once again.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.493
They need you. So do we.

32:55.513 --> 32:56.613
Sofia Vesik.

32:56.633 --> 32:59.453
Hey. Meet my friends.

32:59.473 --> 33:00.670
Hi.

33:01.513 --> 33:02.961
Do your friends have names?

33:02.981 --> 33:04.473
I'm Daniel. This is Robert.

33:04.493 --> 33:06.503
- Robert.
- Do they have last names?

33:06.523 --> 33:10.453
CEO of Tervik Systems, uh,
Employee Number 3 at Skype,

33:10.473 --> 33:12.082
10 million followers at Twitter.

33:12.102 --> 33:14.533
He's exaggerating...
worse than my parents.

33:14.553 --> 33:15.573
Sofia! She's a force of nature.

33:15.593 --> 33:17.573
Tell them about
your "Sama Kaart" program.

33:17.593 --> 33:19.671
Maybe some other time.

33:19.691 --> 33:20.751
Good to meet you.

33:20.771 --> 33:22.543
Any friend of Henrik's...

33:22.563 --> 33:23.985
Bye.

33:24.493 --> 33:27.543
I'll do what I can to put
the pin back in the grenade,

33:27.563 --> 33:29.503
but I'm the old guard.

33:29.523 --> 33:31.121
She might not know it yet,

33:31.141 --> 33:32.623
but the next Prime Minister of Estonia

33:32.643 --> 33:34.663
is sitting right over there.

33:40.583 --> 33:43.523
It must be a hard season for CIA,

33:43.543 --> 33:45.633
battling the ire of your allies
around the world.

33:45.653 --> 33:49.523
You can still trust us, Henrik.
I hope you know that.

33:49.543 --> 33:51.095
Tell us about Sofia.

33:51.443 --> 33:53.453
Can she be brought into our tent?

33:53.473 --> 33:54.513
You mean America's?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.453
No, we mean <i> ours.</i>

33:56.473 --> 33:58.583
Well, she can't be bought.

33:58.603 --> 34:00.473
CIA will only have her loyalty

34:00.493 --> 34:03.463
if she's persuaded it's best for Estonia.

34:03.483 --> 34:05.583
Is that how Diver
brought you into the fold?

34:07.613 --> 34:09.523
You knew him, didn't you?

34:10.583 --> 34:13.503
My name is in the history books.

34:13.523 --> 34:15.592
But he's the one
who should be remembered.

34:20.463 --> 34:22.663
Oh. Yeah. Sure.

34:27.612 --> 34:29.473
100 more years.

34:29.493 --> 34:30.716
Okay, good one.

34:33.096 --> 34:34.827
We were talking about Diver, Henrik.

34:34.847 --> 34:37.092
Wait a minute. You all right?
You want to sit down?

34:37.112 --> 34:38.319
Do you see that?

34:38.339 --> 34:39.533
Henrik?

34:39.553 --> 34:40.632
Halos.

34:41.103 --> 34:43.513
- Okay!
- They're beautiful!

34:43.533 --> 34:45.473
We need to get an ambulance, Daniel.

34:45.493 --> 34:47.572
- I'm gonna go get help.
- Give us some room.

34:58.483 --> 35:00.513
We were with him when he collapsed.

35:00.533 --> 35:02.493
- How long ago?
- 10, 15 minutes.

35:02.513 --> 35:03.523
You got to do something.

35:03.543 --> 35:05.653
I'm sorry. You need to wait over there.

35:08.583 --> 35:11.384
Un-fucking-believable.

35:41.493 --> 35:43.207
Juho Spota.

36:00.563 --> 36:03.493
Tell Sergei I'm coming.

36:22.503 --> 36:24.573
<i>Was he still breathing when you arrived?</i>

36:24.593 --> 36:26.112
No, it doesn't look good.

36:26.132 --> 36:28.503
Okay, if he dies,
what's the next domino to drop?

36:28.523 --> 36:29.644
<i>Unclear.</i>

36:29.664 --> 36:30.984
You know, a country in mourning

36:31.004 --> 36:32.513
could snuff out the fire itself

36:32.533 --> 36:33.623
or light an even fucking bigger one.

36:33.643 --> 36:35.300
And what does Torres think?

36:35.443 --> 36:37.543
You know, he's seeing little green men...

36:37.563 --> 36:40.503
Russian operatives
blending into the population.

36:40.523 --> 36:42.240
Well, worked in Ukraine, didn't it?

36:42.260 --> 36:43.374
<i>You have no idea.</i>

36:43.394 --> 36:45.503
I d... I don't think
we can trust this Torres.

36:45.523 --> 36:47.271
He's a... He's a liability.

36:47.453 --> 36:49.503
You know, I spoke to his CO in Homs,

36:49.523 --> 36:51.603
and he said his IQ was off the charts,

36:51.623 --> 36:54.573
even if he does use some
rather unconventional methods.

36:54.593 --> 36:56.563
And Henrik... I-I've seen a heart attack.

36:56.583 --> 36:58.593
This was... This was different.

36:58.613 --> 37:00.513
Robert, what are you saying?

37:00.533 --> 37:01.921
What, you think he was poisoned?

37:03.008 --> 37:04.553
Hang on a second. The doctor's coming.

37:09.453 --> 37:11.305
My team worked tirelessly,

37:11.325 --> 37:13.483
but there was nothing that could be done.

37:16.523 --> 37:20.473
Henrik Viiding passed of cardiac arrest

37:20.493 --> 37:24.563
at exactly 18:39.

37:27.603 --> 37:29.483
Oh, shit. He's dead.

37:29.503 --> 37:30.533
What's our exposure?

37:30.553 --> 37:32.543
Minimal. We can handle it.

37:32.563 --> 37:35.443
<i>Robert, we need answers. Please get them.</i>

37:40.673 --> 37:42.771
That was way more
than just a heart attack.

37:42.791 --> 37:44.563
We need to get to the body
and get a sample.

37:44.583 --> 37:45.573
Excuse me.

37:45.593 --> 37:48.473
Uh, the men who brought Henrik in?

37:48.493 --> 37:49.974
They're right over there.

37:49.994 --> 37:52.463
I'll see if I can get to him.

37:54.583 --> 37:55.727
Thank you.

41:27.593 --> 41:29.453
Katja.

41:49.523 --> 41:50.663
Sergei?

44:23.553 --> 44:25.533
<i>Hey, it's Robert. Leave a message.</i>

44:25.553 --> 44:27.299
Hey, there's no sign of poisoning

44:27.319 --> 44:29.613
on the lips or the extremities,
so I took a hair sample.

44:29.633 --> 44:31.623
Meet me at the depot, soonest.

44:43.663 --> 44:45.463
Hey.

44:45.483 --> 44:46.463
Hey.

44:46.483 --> 44:47.523
How's your mother?

44:47.543 --> 44:50.603
I meant to ask you last night.
Sorry about that.

44:50.936 --> 44:52.986
Went well. She's a trouper.

44:53.453 --> 44:55.971
Two stents and a bypass.
She's already home.

44:55.991 --> 44:57.553
Well, that's good.

44:57.573 --> 44:59.503
The home part, I mean.

45:00.543 --> 45:02.553
I know it's hard not being there.

45:02.573 --> 45:03.603
Mm.

45:03.623 --> 45:06.553
She's got a lot of friends,
people from church.

45:06.573 --> 45:08.082
It's okay.

45:08.102 --> 45:10.149
No, it's not okay. She's your mother.

45:10.453 --> 45:12.125
So, why don't you pick a few dates

45:12.150 --> 45:13.443
and I'll arrange a leave

45:13.463 --> 45:15.493
and you can go and be with her, yeah?

45:15.513 --> 45:17.633
Maybe after I bring in Adeyemi.

45:18.115 --> 45:20.034
Where are we with that?

45:20.523 --> 45:23.553
His son, Dove,
is a bit of a player, but...

45:23.573 --> 45:24.872
he's into me.

45:26.320 --> 45:27.420
Adeyemi's warming up.

45:27.573 --> 45:29.877
I'm his new favorite chess partner.

45:30.623 --> 45:32.838
Earn their trust, April.

45:33.553 --> 45:36.583
Get Adeyemi to hand over
his tech and then get out.

45:46.841 --> 45:48.088
Talk to me.

45:48.108 --> 45:50.483
Hey. I need two
on the next train out of here.

45:50.503 --> 45:51.603
Confirming.

45:51.623 --> 45:53.603
Two out of...

45:53.623 --> 45:55.493
Balti Jaam Depot.

45:55.513 --> 45:56.583
Okay, heading there now.

45:56.603 --> 45:58.583
You're set. I'm sending.

45:59.114 --> 46:00.563
Oh, uh, do you want to talk to Val?

46:00.583 --> 46:03.593
No. Um, tell her
I'll call her from the train.

46:19.583 --> 46:21.603
Where is it?

46:23.305 --> 46:24.563
Where is it?

47:32.593 --> 47:35.513
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! No, no, no, no!

47:36.543 --> 47:37.653
Aah!

47:51.483 --> 47:52.473
Aah!

48:57.463 --> 48:58.919
Oh, shit.

48:59.583 --> 49:01.129
Oh, fuck.

49:08.633 --> 49:10.180
Oh!

49:29.533 --> 49:31.453
Who did that to you?

49:31.473 --> 49:33.543
I don't know. We need to get out of here.

49:33.563 --> 49:35.443
Ticket's on your phone.

49:35.463 --> 49:36.653
Platform 12.

49:50.533 --> 49:53.453
He had training. He's definitely
been in the field.

49:53.473 --> 49:55.389
Spetsnaz? Fuck!

49:55.409 --> 49:57.936
Torres was right.
There's something going on here.

50:01.483 --> 50:03.593
Whose side are these guys on?

50:03.613 --> 50:04.653
I don't know.

50:04.673 --> 50:06.463
It's some serious shit, Daniel.

50:06.483 --> 50:09.463
We're up to our fucking eyeballs
in Russian operatives.

50:09.483 --> 50:10.543
They got rid of Henrik.

50:10.563 --> 50:13.356
They can't leave any influential
peacemakers on the board.

50:13.381 --> 50:14.421
Sofia's a target.

50:15.245 --> 50:18.513
No. You're way overqualified
for bodyguard detail.

50:18.533 --> 50:20.060
You're coming back to Berlin with me.

50:20.080 --> 50:21.583
I'm not asking. I have to stay here.

50:24.523 --> 50:26.503
This place is a time bomb.
The fuse is lit.

50:26.523 --> 50:29.009
If they get to Sofia, the whole
fucking thing blows up.

50:29.968 --> 50:32.453
Daniel, we need proof
to take back to Langley.

50:32.473 --> 50:34.443
Here. Get this to Valerie.

50:36.603 --> 50:38.493
- I'll take them with me.
- Excuse me.

50:38.513 --> 50:40.543
- Go. I got this.
- Daniel.

50:40.563 --> 50:41.971
Daniel.

51:07.297 --> 51:08.289
Yes?

51:08.309 --> 51:10.603
<i>It went to shit, Valerie.</i>

51:10.623 --> 51:12.473
Robert, where are you?

51:12.493 --> 51:15.563
I'm on a train overnight
to Warsaw, connecting to Berlin.

51:16.593 --> 51:18.100
What happened?

51:18.563 --> 51:20.483
Daniel.

51:20.503 --> 51:21.623
Is he with you?

51:21.643 --> 51:22.603
<i>No.</i>

51:22.623 --> 51:24.533
Robert, where's Daniel?

51:24.553 --> 51:25.857
<i>We got separated.</i>

51:26.443 --> 51:29.483
I left him there. He's wounded.

51:33.473 --> 51:35.663
I... I don't...
I don't know what happened.

51:36.350 --> 51:38.400
Just get home safe, Robert.
