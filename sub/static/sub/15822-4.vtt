00:45.133 --> 00:46.767
thank you, officer.

00:51.934 --> 00:53.434
we were across the street at a court

00:53.467 --> 00:55.100
when communications called.

00:55.133 --> 00:57.367
-how'd you get here so fast?  - someone else called me.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.167
-who?  -chief johnson.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.767
ah, y'all remember Ricardo Ramos,

01:01.801 --> 01:05.300
-our friendly reporter from the times?  -how you doing, ricky?

01:05.334 --> 01:07.133
i was on my way to work, when -- bang, bang, bang!

01:07.167 --> 01:09.234
-did you see the shooter?  -no, i came from around that corner,

01:09.267 --> 01:10.834
found this guy laying here.

01:10.868 --> 01:13.567
-when i rolled him over,  -he -- you rolled him over?!

01:14.601 --> 01:17.000
ricardo, that press badge

01:17.033 --> 01:19.734
does not give you the right to tamper with the crime scene.

01:19.767 --> 01:21.434
you have compromised the evidence.

01:21.467 --> 01:24.367
hey, hey, chief johnson, you ever hear of cpr? i was trying to help.

01:26.601 --> 01:29.200
look, i called 911.

01:29.234 --> 01:30.634
when the paramedics cut open the shirt,

01:30.634 --> 01:31.834
i called you directly...

01:31.868 --> 01:33.667
because given the circumstances of this case,

01:33.701 --> 01:35.234
it has priority written all over it.

01:35.267 --> 01:36.501
what circumstances?

01:36.534 --> 01:37.701
well, may i?

01:38.634 --> 01:40.167
go ahead.

01:42.634 --> 01:44.667
no, no, no!

01:44.701 --> 01:46.767
easy. easy! hold on, hold on.

01:46.801 --> 01:48.734
let go, let go.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.834
he's wearing a wire.

02:02.467 --> 02:04.601
no i.d.

02:07.067 --> 02:09.400
you don't recognize this guy?

02:09.434 --> 02:11.334
ricardo, i want to thank you so much for your help,

02:11.367 --> 02:12.734
but now you must let us do our job.

02:12.767 --> 02:14.067
and then you'll get your story.

02:14.100 --> 02:15.133
oh, no. i have a story.

02:15.167 --> 02:17.200
what are you gonna write?

02:17.234 --> 02:19.601
"unidentified man found dead"?

02:19.634 --> 02:23.033
"unidentified man found dead wearing a wire."

02:23.067 --> 02:25.734
"police not only fail to protect an undercover operative,

02:25.767 --> 02:27.467
they can't even identify him."

02:27.501 --> 02:28.868
for one thing, we're not even sure

02:28.901 --> 02:30.400
this is an undercover operation.

02:30.434 --> 02:33.200
and in this case, ricardo, you're not just a reporter.

02:33.234 --> 02:35.300
you're also our only witness.

02:35.334 --> 02:37.334
we could tie up your whole day asking you questions,

02:37.367 --> 02:39.660
checking facts, testing your hands for gunshot residue.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.934
you're not going to do that.

02:40.968 --> 02:43.667
detective sanchez, mr. ramos here would love to give you his statement.

02:43.701 --> 02:45.167
thank you. thank you so much.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.267
vamos, ramos.

02:48.033 --> 02:51.434
okay. what do we have here?

02:51.467 --> 02:56.000
our victim took 3 rounds from a 9-millimeter.

02:56.033 --> 02:59.300
one of the rounds went right through his cellphone in his breast pocket.

02:59.334 --> 03:02.000
okay, no wallet, but we do have a set of keys.

03:02.033 --> 03:04.945
so either the person who robbed him didn't know he was wearing a wire,

03:04.945 --> 03:05.367
or he --

03:05.400 --> 03:07.934
shooter wanted to make it look like a robbery.

03:07.968 --> 03:09.334
well, yeah.

03:09.367 --> 03:11.934
look, no way this is an undercover cop.

03:11.968 --> 03:14.267
his backup would be on top of this inside of 30 seconds.

03:14.300 --> 03:16.300
yeah, but it could be a confidential informant.

03:16.334 --> 03:18.167
i say no. his backup would still be here.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.300
okay, lieutenant flynn, would you please check

03:20.334 --> 03:22.000
with the watch commander at narcotics --

03:22.033 --> 03:23.734
see if anyone was working a wire today?

03:23.767 --> 03:27.434
and, uh, better call internal affairs, too.

03:27.467 --> 03:29.100
lieutenant provenza, what are you doing?!

03:29.133 --> 03:32.601
shoes. these are custom-made.

03:32.634 --> 03:36.000
i got a pair just like them. very comfortable, too.

03:36.033 --> 03:39.367
and, see, that is the customer number

03:39.400 --> 03:41.234
printed right there inside.

03:41.267 --> 03:43.300
might tell us who this guy is.

03:43.334 --> 03:45.033
you wear homemade shoes?

03:45.067 --> 03:47.601
custom-made.

03:47.634 --> 03:50.033
and, y-yes, ma'am, i do.

03:50.067 --> 03:52.901
i have a little bit of a...orthopedic issue.

03:52.934 --> 03:54.934
does medicare pay for them?

03:54.968 --> 03:56.634
okay, lieutenant tao,

03:56.667 --> 03:58.934
please run the victim's prints through afis.

03:58.968 --> 04:01.300
see if we can get a more traditional i.d. on him.

04:01.334 --> 04:03.934
and, sergeant gabriel, get some uniforms,

04:03.968 --> 04:06.634
canvass all the buildings with a view down onto the street.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.868
somebody saw something.

04:07.901 --> 04:09.334
uh, here's the thing, chief.

04:09.367 --> 04:12.033
this camera was transmitting audio and video

04:12.067 --> 04:15.567
to a remote receiver up until the paramedics disconnected it.

04:15.601 --> 04:18.466
whoever's on the other end could have witnessed the whole shooting

04:18.500 --> 04:21.166
and probably recorded the whole thing onto a computer.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.901
so, where are they?

04:33.634 --> 04:36.100
buzz, what can you tell me about that wire?

04:36.133 --> 04:38.901
well, this camera's pretty powerful for its size.

04:38.934 --> 04:40.834
a ccd sensor, high-gain antenna,

04:40.868 --> 04:43.968
2.4 gigahertz transmitter, and the receiver's portable.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.534
you can hook it up to any laptop.

04:45.567 --> 04:47.934
-is it one of ours?  -well, that's hard to tell.

04:47.968 --> 04:50.167
i mean, you can buy this at any electronics store,

04:50.200 --> 04:51.567
but this one looks brand-new.

04:51.601 --> 04:52.801
well, there's your answer.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.667
if it's new, it can't be l.a.p.d.

04:54.701 --> 04:57.934
i don't think there's even a remote chance this guy was working for us.

04:57.968 --> 04:59.501
well, for what it's worth,

04:59.534 --> 05:01.801
narcotics says they haven't run a wire in over a week.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.100
central, hollenbeck -- they're both quiet, too.

05:04.133 --> 05:07.701
i got to tell you, chief -- these divisions,

05:07.734 --> 05:09.634
they keep their c.i.s under a pretty tight lid.

05:10.501 --> 05:13.667
ladies and gentleman, once again,

05:13.701 --> 05:16.067
i must ask you to hold your applause -- drumroll, please.

05:16.100 --> 05:18.868
the name of our vic is...

05:18.901 --> 05:20.567
benjamin masters.

05:20.601 --> 05:22.401
the company that made his shoes gave me his name,

05:22.401 --> 05:24.467
his credit-card number,

05:24.501 --> 05:28.000
and his ship-to address -- la brea realty, thousand oaks.

05:28.033 --> 05:30.300
i'm calling now, thank you.

05:30.334 --> 05:34.000
now, why was a real-estate agent wearing a wire?

05:34.033 --> 05:36.834
could be a fed sting on mortgage lenders.

05:36.868 --> 05:38.067
are we sure that the victim

05:38.100 --> 05:39.868
didn't just steal mr. masters' shoes?

05:39.901 --> 05:42.367
i'd hate to notify his next of kin based on his footwear.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.501
chief, looks like him. he lives in woodland hills.

05:47.901 --> 05:49.300
excuse me, chief,

05:49.334 --> 05:51.168
i have checked with the fbi, dea,

05:51.178 --> 05:53.340
atf, doj, and ice.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.901
nobody claims our john doe.

05:55.934 --> 05:57.634
we have a name. it's benjamin masters.

05:57.667 --> 05:58.901
i hate to make you

05:58.934 --> 06:00.801
run through the same gauntlet again, detective,

06:00.834 --> 06:03.634
but i think that we should give the feds another go.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.133
thank you.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.467
um, buzz, what kind of a range does that transmitter have?

06:07.501 --> 06:09.367
about a mile line of sight --

06:09.400 --> 06:11.767
a little less in they city with all the high-rises.

06:11.801 --> 06:13.734
so, the receiver could be pretty much anywhere

06:13.767 --> 06:15.033
in the downtown area.

06:15.067 --> 06:17.801
yeah, including this very building.

06:17.834 --> 06:20.801
there's still the issue of his cellphone.

06:20.834 --> 06:22.334
it's a prepaid model.

06:22.367 --> 06:25.234
the sim card was destroyed by the bullet.

06:25.267 --> 06:28.334
the technology is available to dump it.

06:28.367 --> 06:31.167
we just don't have it...here.

06:31.200 --> 06:32.601
okay, according to la brea realty,

06:32.634 --> 06:34.701
benjamin masters was a sales agent

06:34.734 --> 06:36.300
up until about six months ago when --

06:36.334 --> 06:38.434
he was downsized.

06:38.467 --> 06:40.801
so, if he's not working there, where is he working?

06:40.834 --> 06:43.133
i do not want to talk about this right now, sergeant!

06:44.634 --> 06:46.501
excuse me.

06:55.767 --> 06:59.267
uh...chief, you know, uh,

06:59.300 --> 07:01.534
if you want to go on out to this woodland hills address

07:01.567 --> 07:02.968
and, you know, visit with the family,

07:03.000 --> 07:05.767
i-i'll take care of things here.

07:05.801 --> 07:08.167
okay. good luck with that.

07:09.634 --> 07:11.000
gentlemen.

07:16.767 --> 07:18.133
lieutenant tao? please.

07:30.901 --> 07:33.033
how does someone who lives here

07:33.067 --> 07:35.767
end up dead on the streets of downtown?

07:35.801 --> 07:37.067
i give up.

07:37.100 --> 07:40.367
i thought i could reverse-engineer this cellphone,

07:40.400 --> 07:41.567
but i can't.

07:41.601 --> 07:43.000
sorry, chief.

07:43.033 --> 07:46.200
maybe you could have one of your friends at the fbi give it a shot.

07:46.234 --> 07:48.868
um...lieutenant, maybe you can tell me.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.667
are sergeant gabriel and detective daniels

07:51.701 --> 07:53.667
still together?

07:53.701 --> 07:56.234
well, you know how relationships are.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.801
once you realize

07:57.834 --> 08:02.100
that love is more than just sexual attraction --

08:02.133 --> 08:03.534
when you go beyond the purely carnal

08:03.567 --> 08:05.767
and the lust wears off -- okay, okay, never mind, never mind!

08:05.801 --> 08:08.200
i don't want to hear another word about that!

08:08.234 --> 08:10.133
not one word!

08:17.234 --> 08:21.334
this is exactly why i don't like people dating at work!

08:26.133 --> 08:28.300
sorry, lieutenant. it's not your fault.

08:28.334 --> 08:30.367
oh, no, chief, it's just been a while

08:30.400 --> 08:32.567
since i've been on a death notification.

08:32.601 --> 08:36.534
oh, well, best not to get out of practice.

08:36.567 --> 08:37.868
hi. mrs. masters?

08:37.900 --> 08:40.033
trisha. i'm so sorry.

08:40.067 --> 08:42.033
are we showing the house today?

08:42.067 --> 08:44.501
um, ma'am, i'm deputy chief johnson,

08:44.534 --> 08:46.534
and this is lieutenant tao.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.701
we're from the los angeles police.

08:48.734 --> 08:51.400
do you mind if we come in for a talk?

08:51.434 --> 08:52.567
please.

08:52.601 --> 08:55.467
i'm just getting organized for our next open house.

08:55.501 --> 08:58.434
my husband's in real estate, so we're always, like,

08:58.467 --> 09:00.934
just moving in or just moving out.

09:00.968 --> 09:02.100
i understand.

09:02.133 --> 09:04.467
mrs. masters, is there anyone else at home?

09:04.501 --> 09:08.100
uh, my kids are in school, and ben is at work.

09:08.133 --> 09:10.400
ma'am is there a computer in the house --

09:10.434 --> 09:12.734
something with wireless access or a webcam receiver?

09:12.767 --> 09:14.834
wireless -- um...

09:14.868 --> 09:18.734
well, we do have a family computer in the den.

09:18.767 --> 09:23.400
and ben takes his laptop to work, so...

09:23.434 --> 09:26.467
um...are we...

09:26.501 --> 09:29.300
are we in some sort of trouble?

09:29.334 --> 09:32.000
did ben take his car to work today?

09:34.634 --> 09:35.934
mrs. masters?

09:35.968 --> 09:39.367
oh, god. there's been an accident?

09:39.400 --> 09:42.400
ma'am, are these his keys?

09:44.100 --> 09:45.901
w-why do you have these?

09:48.434 --> 09:50.000
what is going on?

09:52.701 --> 09:56.367
-ma'am, we have some very bad news.  -oh, god.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.000
unfortunately --

09:58.033 --> 10:01.300
-no, no, no, no, no.  -mrs. masters, your husband was murdered this morning.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.934
we are very, very sorry.

10:02.968 --> 10:05.434
i promise you that we are doing everything we can

10:05.467 --> 10:06.601
to find out what happened to him.

10:06.634 --> 10:08.934
no, you know what? this is a mistake.

10:08.968 --> 10:10.934
wait, wait, you know, i-i just talked to him.

10:10.968 --> 10:13.067
t-this morning i talked to him. he's at work.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.767
according to his employers, ben was laid off six months ago.

10:15.767 --> 10:17.133
no, no, no, no, no.

10:17.166 --> 10:20.066
i just told you, okay? ben is at work.

10:20.099 --> 10:22.800
h-he just got back from a business trip,

10:22.834 --> 10:25.099
a-and this key here -- see this key on the ring? --

10:25.133 --> 10:28.834
it's for a lockbox for this property that he shows.

10:28.867 --> 10:31.567
so h-how could he not be at work?

10:31.600 --> 10:32.834
i'm so sorry, ma'am. we have to --

10:32.867 --> 10:35.834
no, no, if ben was laid off, okay,

10:35.867 --> 10:39.200
then just tell me -- where did he get the $100,000 bonus?

10:52.133 --> 10:53.366
-hey, uh, chief?  -yes.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.600
i just wanted to apologize for the outburst earlier.

10:58.633 --> 11:01.600
it was totally inappropriate, and it won't happen again.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.333
i hope not, sergeant.

11:03.366 --> 11:06.166
you see, the thing is --

11:06.200 --> 11:08.733
and i don't want to go into too many details --

11:08.767 --> 11:10.133
oh, please don't.

11:11.999 --> 11:14.867
daniels and i broke up a couple weeks ago.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.867
and things have been...

11:16.900 --> 11:20.033
awkward since then.

11:21.266 --> 11:24.433
anyway, i'm afraid that it, um...

11:24.467 --> 11:26.133
the stuff between us might be affecting

11:26.166 --> 11:28.667
the cohesiveness of our division,

11:28.700 --> 11:31.066
and i'm not sure that we both can stay.

11:31.099 --> 11:33.733
and i've been thinking that it might be best

11:33.767 --> 11:36.266
if daniels transferred out.

11:36.300 --> 11:39.867
-i mean, i'm not -- i'm not angry. -oh, i can see that.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.966
i'm just thinking about what's best for her

11:41.999 --> 11:44.800
and what's best for the entire --

11:44.834 --> 11:47.433
excuse me, chief, is this a good time?

11:47.467 --> 11:50.467
yes, it is. it's a perfect time, detective.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.834
come on in.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.266
okay, i have spoken

11:55.300 --> 11:59.133
with every federal and state agency you can think of,

11:59.166 --> 12:01.433
and none of them has any knowledge of benjamin masters

12:01.467 --> 12:05.033
as either an agent, a c.i., or a suspect.

12:05.066 --> 12:07.966
what about the $100,000 bonus he told his wife about?

12:07.999 --> 12:11.033
masters hasn't received a paycheck since he lost his job.

12:11.066 --> 12:13.133
in fact, in the past five months,

12:13.166 --> 12:15.533
he's borrowed nearly $200,000 against his home.

12:15.567 --> 12:18.834
-so, she was lying to us?  -or he was lying to her.

12:18.867 --> 12:22.867
six weeks ago, he paid off over half of his entire debt --

12:22.900 --> 12:25.567
$113,000 in cash --

12:25.600 --> 12:28.166
which suggests he found a new way to earn a living...

12:28.200 --> 12:29.733
under the table.

12:29.767 --> 12:33.633
well, thank you, detective. that was thorough.

12:42.366 --> 12:44.366
tell me, sergeant, can you do that --

12:44.400 --> 12:46.733
what she just did -- the forensic accounting?

12:46.767 --> 12:48.066
what do you mean -- the stuff with the banks?

12:48.099 --> 12:50.600
'cause i need someone with expertise

12:50.633 --> 12:53.834
with "that stuff with the banks" on our team.

12:55.233 --> 12:59.500
and since you think the cohesiveness of our division

12:59.533 --> 13:01.133
is being hurt,

13:01.166 --> 13:03.934
then one of you absolutely must go.

13:03.966 --> 13:06.366
fill out that transfer request,

13:06.400 --> 13:09.166
and start thinking about where you might want me to send you.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.400
heads up, everybody!

13:13.433 --> 13:14.667
benjamin masters kept a key

13:14.700 --> 13:16.800
to one of his company's lockboxes for a reason.

13:16.834 --> 13:18.667
if we find that lockbox, we might just find

13:18.700 --> 13:20.767
where he's been going for the past six months

13:20.800 --> 13:22.567
when he told his wife he was at work.

13:22.600 --> 13:25.099
we could find the computer on the receiving end of the wire.

13:25.133 --> 13:26.033
let's start our search

13:26.034 --> 13:28.034
within the radius of the camera's transmitter.

13:28.066 --> 13:30.166
detective daniels, please call traffic and have them check

13:30.200 --> 13:33.900
the impound lots and surface streets for mr. masters' car.

13:33.934 --> 13:34.934
lieutenant provenza, please search

13:34.966 --> 13:37.733
all the la brea realty properties listed inside that circle.

13:37.767 --> 13:40.066
w-wait a minute, chief.

13:40.099 --> 13:42.266
there's three pages of them here!

13:41.300 --> 13:43.934
detective sanchez and lieutenant flynn will help you.

13:43.966 --> 13:45.066
lieutenant tao, let's you and i go to the fbi

13:45.067 --> 13:47.067
and see about this phone.

13:47.099 --> 13:48.834
thank you.

13:54.400 --> 13:58.166
benjamin masters was definitely not working for the fbi.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.500
but we were able to crack his prepaid cell.

14:00.533 --> 14:02.700
it was easier than we thought, actually.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.700
well, sure, it's easy when you have

14:04.733 --> 14:06.867
a state-of-the-art convolutional decoder.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.266
so, who was he calling?

14:08.300 --> 14:12.300
well, that's where things get more complicated.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.567
you're looking at one of the largest

14:15.600 --> 14:17.767
drug-trafficking organizations in the u.s.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.667
came up from south america in the '90s.

14:20.700 --> 14:24.867
run by raul mejia -- aka "el jefe."

14:24.900 --> 14:27.834
got an entire black book dedicated to his operation.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.300
and what's masters' connection?

14:30.333 --> 14:31.800
his phone.

14:31.834 --> 14:34.800
it was part of a batch of prepaid cellphones

14:34.834 --> 14:37.033
el jefe bought in bulk and handed out to his crew.

14:37.066 --> 14:38.867
now, there are literally dozens of calls

14:38.900 --> 14:42.999
between and ben masters and another number in the batch.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.266
so much for narrowing down our suspects.

14:47.300 --> 14:50.066
you said this was a south american gang.

14:50.099 --> 14:52.966
masters wasn't latino.

14:52.999 --> 14:54.934
recently, they've been hiring anglos

14:54.966 --> 14:57.066
to carry their cargo across the border.

14:57.099 --> 14:59.366
white faces attract less attention at customs.

14:59.400 --> 15:03.133
that explains the business trips his wife said he was taking.

15:03.166 --> 15:05.033
and the sudden inflow of cash.

15:05.066 --> 15:07.500
log says the last call masters received

15:07.533 --> 15:10.266
came in 9:18 a.m. --

15:10.300 --> 15:11.934
20 minutes before he was shot.

15:11.966 --> 15:13.867
well, find out who he was talking to...

15:13.900 --> 15:15.133
maybe find the shooter.

15:15.166 --> 15:18.667
i really need to see that video from ben masters' wire.

15:21.099 --> 15:23.633
i'm telling you, this is the dumbest snipe hunt

15:23.667 --> 15:24.999
she has ever sent us on.

15:25.033 --> 15:28.233
i'm out here pounding the pavement like some damn rookie!

15:28.266 --> 15:29.166
what's the matter?

15:29.167 --> 15:30.734
your medicare shoes don't like to walk uphill?

15:30.767 --> 15:32.834
well, one of them's about to walk up your ass!

15:32.867 --> 15:34.867
now, you don't you worry about my shoes, flynn.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.300
you just worry about the fact

15:36.333 --> 15:37.966
that we are never going to find this car.

15:37.999 --> 15:39.600
oh, yeah? we're gonna find the car.

15:39.633 --> 15:41.200
l-lieutenants!

15:41.233 --> 15:43.934
there's only one more building inside the mile radius.

15:43.966 --> 15:47.099
if it is not here, then it's got to be at the last building.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.700
flynn, what in the hell are you doing?

15:50.733 --> 15:52.800
i'm using my head as an antenna.

15:52.834 --> 15:53.834
you want to try?

15:53.867 --> 15:54.867
uh, no, thank you.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.500
okay, i read about it on the internet.

15:56.533 --> 15:58.533
it says it increases the range by 100 feet.

15:58.567 --> 15:59.900
i don't -- i don't care.

16:16.467 --> 16:19.300
all right, looks like he was living in the car.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.966
a bunch of clothes and garbage.

16:21.999 --> 16:23.667
there's no computer.

16:26.099 --> 16:27.966
okay. we got the building.

16:27.999 --> 16:31.667
all we have to do now is find the lockbox that this key opens.

16:51.300 --> 16:54.300
so...this is where he's been going to work

16:54.333 --> 16:55.633
for the last six months.

16:55.667 --> 16:56.999
and the wife never knew.

16:57.033 --> 16:58.834
they never do.

16:58.867 --> 17:01.533
hey, lieutenants. in here.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.300
you gentlemen up for a movie?

17:26.133 --> 17:27.666
testing...

17:28.600 --> 17:30.767
testing.

17:32.099 --> 17:34.133
and now back from the dead,

17:34.166 --> 17:36.433
via the video camera from his shirt --

17:36.467 --> 17:39.133
chief johnson, meet benjamin masters.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.567
you can do this.

17:43.066 --> 17:45.366
-you can do this.  -doesn't look like a drug dealer to me.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.934
i think that's the point, sergeant.

17:47.966 --> 17:50.166
okay.

17:51.300 --> 17:55.400
yeah?

17:55.433 --> 17:57.934
why not?!

17:57.966 --> 18:00.099
no, we're doing this now.

18:00.133 --> 18:02.867
no. no way, man. we can't meet here.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.266
because.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.533
listen, they're showing other units in the building today.

18:07.567 --> 18:10.066
i don't want anyone to see us together.

18:10.099 --> 18:12.467
just meet me where i said.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.066
if you screw me on this,

18:14.099 --> 18:17.233
i'm telling you, i am not going down alone.

18:17.266 --> 18:19.867
i want what you stole from me!

18:20.767 --> 18:22.200
no.

18:22.233 --> 18:23.900
i'm leaving now.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.999
okay.

18:28.033 --> 18:30.066
let's go.

18:30.099 --> 18:32.467
okay, buzz. uh, all right, let's -- fast-forward.

18:32.500 --> 18:33.600
let's go.

18:35.433 --> 18:37.333
no, no. no, no.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.600
all right...

18:39.633 --> 18:41.200
there!

18:41.233 --> 18:42.834
okay.

18:42.867 --> 18:46.133
and here comes masters around the corner

18:46.166 --> 18:47.667
and into the alley.

18:49.233 --> 18:50.966
and then...

18:55.767 --> 18:58.433
i don't know what y'all are so excited about.

18:58.467 --> 19:00.934
we don't even get to see the killer's face.

19:00.966 --> 19:03.567
chief, h-hold on. it's not a total loss.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.300
now, buzz, i want you to -- i want you to go back.

19:06.333 --> 19:09.133
all right. come on.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.600
all right, now -- right there, stop.

19:11.633 --> 19:15.533
go forward slowly.

19:15.567 --> 19:16.834
come on, come on.

19:16.867 --> 19:18.600
there.

19:18.633 --> 19:19.733
there it is.

19:19.767 --> 19:23.200
you know, i never liked big rings on a guy.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.400
it's gaudy.

19:24.433 --> 19:26.333
thank you, buzz.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.166
wait, chief -- c-ch--

19:29.200 --> 19:32.934
i think you, uh -- i think you need to see this.

19:32.966 --> 19:36.033
okay, buzz, if you would be so kind...

19:36.066 --> 19:39.133
we may not have the murderer on tape,

19:39.166 --> 19:42.166
but look who we found later.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.266
oh, for heaven's sakes!

19:44.300 --> 19:45.966
freeze that!

19:45.999 --> 19:48.333
doesn't look like he's doing cpr to me.

19:55.767 --> 19:57.233
i wasn't lying, chief johnson.

19:57.266 --> 19:59.066
i didn't know if he was still alive.

19:59.099 --> 20:01.600
and you thought the best way to get his heart pumping again

20:01.633 --> 20:03.400
would be to rifle through his pockets?

20:03.433 --> 20:05.567
ricardo, i-i feel like you don't understand --

20:05.600 --> 20:07.166
-chief -- -still talking --

20:07.200 --> 20:09.433
that your access to the l.a.p.d.

20:09.467 --> 20:12.033
depends on your not interfering with criminal inquiries.

20:12.066 --> 20:14.828
things like moving bodies and calling suspects' attorneys.

20:14.828 --> 20:15.700
okay, look, i --

20:17.033 --> 20:20.166
and now you've crossed the line into criminal behavior.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.834
when the district attorney sees this tape,

20:21.867 --> 20:23.567
he will happily charge you

20:23.568 --> 20:24.568
with attempting to steal from a murder victim.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.500
okay. okay. i see where this is going.

20:26.533 --> 20:27.834
what do you want from me?

20:27.867 --> 20:31.700
oh, no, ricardo, it's what you want from us -- an exclusive.

20:33.467 --> 20:34.700
pencils up.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.634
"sources inside the l.a.p.d.

20:42.667 --> 20:44.567
"say the unidentified man found dead

20:44.601 --> 20:46.834
"in a downtown alley early yesterday morning

20:46.868 --> 20:49.000
"was wearing a concealed video camera,

20:49.033 --> 20:51.634
"which means that the killer was caught on tape.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.000
"the department is mustering all available resources

20:54.033 --> 20:55.567
"so they can locate the base receiver

20:55.601 --> 20:57.667
and bring the killer to justice."

20:57.701 --> 21:00.367
and you'll run that on the front page of tomorrow's paper.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.367
and if my editor doesn't go along with it?

21:02.400 --> 21:05.067
then it will suck to be you.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.033
hurry up, now!

21:07.067 --> 21:08.634
you're on a deadline.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.634
do you really want the killer to know that you've got him on tape?

21:20.667 --> 21:23.267
no comment.

21:27.701 --> 21:31.267
so, let's say the killer actually reads this article.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.767
do you really think he's gonna risk

21:32.801 --> 21:34.367
breaking into the loft masters was using

21:34.400 --> 21:36.400
to steal this tape of himself committing murder?

21:36.434 --> 21:37.601
i sure hope so, will,

21:37.634 --> 21:40.300
'cause that's exactly where i'll be waiting for him.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.300
hey, paper got it wrong.

21:47.334 --> 21:49.968
i thought you guys found the video of ben masters' murder.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.434
we did. it's on his hard drive.

21:51.467 --> 21:53.868
but we want the killer to think it's still out there.

21:53.901 --> 21:55.834
we're hoping that this article will get him

21:55.868 --> 21:57.734
to come looking for masters' computer.

21:57.767 --> 21:59.934
hmm.

22:02.567 --> 22:05.033
where does masters live?

22:05.067 --> 22:07.000
some place in woodland hills.

22:07.033 --> 22:08.868
hey! wait a minute!

22:08.901 --> 22:10.834
what?

22:10.868 --> 22:13.634
you're not thinking about taking over my case, are you?

22:13.667 --> 22:15.901
brenda, this could be the break we've been looking for.

22:15.934 --> 22:18.667
if we get this guy and he cooperates, then --

22:18.701 --> 22:19.868
then what?

22:19.901 --> 22:21.934
i lose my case, and the killer gets a short stint

22:21.968 --> 22:23.801
in a powder-puff prison and a nice house in idaho,

22:23.834 --> 22:25.801
courtesy of the federal government.

22:25.834 --> 22:27.701
that's not my idea of justice.

22:27.734 --> 22:28.868
hey.

22:30.434 --> 22:32.901
if whoever murdered masters comes looking for the tape

22:32.934 --> 22:34.801
and we can get him to flip on el jefe,

22:34.834 --> 22:37.067
we can take down that entire wall.

22:37.100 --> 22:39.267
what do you want?

22:39.300 --> 22:42.067
i want to take over the sting on ben masters' house.

22:44.467 --> 22:46.334
if i give you that,

22:46.367 --> 22:48.300
then i need something in return.

22:48.334 --> 22:49.634
like what?

22:49.667 --> 22:52.868
the fbi folder on the gang, the entire black book.

22:52.901 --> 22:56.267
so i know who it is i'm giving away.

22:57.467 --> 22:59.133
okay.

23:08.901 --> 23:10.534
i give you the black book,

23:10.567 --> 23:13.567
your team backs off ben masters' house completely.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.200
completely -- i mean it.

23:15.234 --> 23:16.434
done.

23:51.934 --> 23:53.133
don't move!

23:56.100 --> 23:57.868
now, step forward slowly.

23:59.167 --> 24:01.367
step forward slowly! put the computer down slowly.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.334
don't drop it, or i'll blow your head off!

24:03.367 --> 24:04.367
okay, okay, all right.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.067
down on your knees!

24:06.100 --> 24:07.467
hands behind your head!

24:15.400 --> 24:17.501
i'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson.

24:17.534 --> 24:18.601
and you are?

24:18.634 --> 24:20.434
none of your business. ow! what the hell, man?!

24:20.467 --> 24:22.367
well, i'll be sure to let the times know

24:22.400 --> 24:25.300
that they have another loyal reader.

24:25.334 --> 24:27.834
you are under arrest for the murder of benjamin masters.

24:27.868 --> 24:29.100
detective sanchez.

24:30.968 --> 24:32.400
take it easy, man!

24:32.434 --> 24:33.300
thank you.

24:33.334 --> 24:35.167
you have the right to shut up!

24:35.200 --> 24:36.334
any stupid thing you say

24:36.367 --> 24:38.234
can and will be used against you in a court of law.

24:38.267 --> 24:39.734
you have the right to an attorney.

24:39.767 --> 24:41.601
if your broke ass can't afford an attorney,

24:41.634 --> 24:43.734
one will be appointed for you...

24:56.754 --> 24:59.587
-what the hell is this?!  -mrs. masters.

24:59.621 --> 25:02.721
the paper says that you have a video of my husband's murder.

25:02.754 --> 25:03.821
i want to see it.

25:03.854 --> 25:05.721
i'm sorry, ma'am. i can't let you do that.

25:05.754 --> 25:09.087
last night, i was up with two crying kids

25:09.120 --> 25:11.654
because you told me that ben was murdered.

25:11.687 --> 25:12.888
and then this morning,

25:12.920 --> 25:15.320
i read this -- this horrible article about --

25:15.354 --> 25:18.754
no! -- how the victim has yet to be identified!

25:18.788 --> 25:21.687
i'm so sorry. i could have kept you better informed.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.020
i really am. i --

25:23.053 --> 25:25.554
wait. is this dean murphy?

25:27.521 --> 25:29.120
you know this man?

25:29.154 --> 25:31.554
he went to high school with my husband.

25:31.587 --> 25:34.487
he...got into drugs.

25:34.521 --> 25:36.087
what is all this?

25:39.020 --> 25:41.521
had ben seen dean recently?

25:41.554 --> 25:42.587
i don't know.

25:42.621 --> 25:45.821
okay, i don't -- i don't know anything more.

25:45.854 --> 25:48.087
-okay, let's go back to my office...  -no, no, no, no!

25:48.120 --> 25:51.788
if you have video of my husband's murder, i want to see it!

25:51.821 --> 25:53.220
i want the tape!

25:53.254 --> 25:54.953
i just don't think that's a good idea.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.287
i can handle it.

25:57.320 --> 26:01.687
i know no one thinks that i can handle anything...

26:01.721 --> 26:03.721
but i can.

26:03.754 --> 26:06.788
i can handle it.

26:06.821 --> 26:08.920
no, i can handle -- i can handle it.

26:08.953 --> 26:10.754
it's okay. it's okay.

26:10.788 --> 26:13.421
how about if we get some coffee, okay?

26:13.454 --> 26:14.521
come on.

26:14.554 --> 26:16.053
okay.

26:21.987 --> 26:25.953
lieutenant tao, where's dean murphy? interview 1.

26:25.987 --> 26:27.953
would you please meet me there in five minutes

26:27.987 --> 26:32.020
and bring your blowback and blood-patter-tester kit?

26:32.053 --> 26:33.087
my what?

26:33.120 --> 26:35.654
i believe it's right in there.

26:35.687 --> 26:37.254
thank you.

26:38.621 --> 26:40.654
oh.

26:40.687 --> 26:43.254
my b.b.s.t.

26:44.788 --> 26:47.320
on headphones

26:59.254 --> 27:01.521
you don't know what you're talking about!

27:01.554 --> 27:03.687
tell me you are not lying. i'm not lying.

27:03.721 --> 27:05.621
i saw the paperwork on your desk, david.

27:05.654 --> 27:07.554
well, did you read it, irene?

27:07.587 --> 27:10.354
because if you had, you would have seen it said

27:10.387 --> 27:12.654
"sergeant gabriel" and not "detective daniels."

27:12.687 --> 27:14.953
oh, no, you are not leaving priority homicide

27:14.987 --> 27:17.020
-and blaming it on me.  -one of us has to go.

27:17.053 --> 27:20.220
well, that's because you are acting like such a baby!

27:20.254 --> 27:21.687
the minute you turn in that paperwork,

27:21.721 --> 27:23.387
every guy in this building will say that you left phd

27:23.421 --> 27:25.020
because i broke up with you.

27:25.053 --> 27:26.521
whoa, whoa, whoa! is that what you're telling people?

27:26.554 --> 27:28.287
that you broke up with me?!

27:28.320 --> 27:30.521
i'm not talking about -- because i have a problem with that!

27:30.554 --> 27:32.821
-i'm not talking about it at all!  -that is enough!

27:32.854 --> 27:35.354
i've had it with both of you!

27:35.387 --> 27:37.587
now, wait for me in my office!

27:38.587 --> 27:40.687
you happy? you did this.

27:40.721 --> 27:42.987
no. i'm not. you did this.

27:43.020 --> 27:45.521
please tell me you weren't recording that.

27:45.554 --> 27:48.387
unfortunately, no.

27:49.654 --> 27:52.421
i'd tell you how ashamed i am of both of you,

27:52.454 --> 27:55.320
but i have to get this done before we have visitors.

27:55.354 --> 27:58.687
please let me know when they arrive.

27:58.721 --> 28:00.587
yes, ma'am.

28:07.654 --> 28:08.987
hi, again, mr. murphy.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.521
that is your name --

28:11.554 --> 28:14.187
dean emmet murphy?

28:19.920 --> 28:21.888
shit!

28:26.053 --> 28:27.421
what are you doing?

28:27.454 --> 28:28.654
hang on, hang on.

28:28.687 --> 28:30.821
let me get my ducks in a row here.

28:30.854 --> 28:33.254
you're a pretty big arrest for me.

28:36.754 --> 28:38.854
now...

28:38.888 --> 28:42.721
i have read your file, mr. murphy,

28:42.754 --> 28:46.487
and according to the fbi, you are a rising star

28:46.521 --> 28:49.721
in a very large drug-trafficking organization.

28:49.754 --> 28:54.053
they even have video of you with a major kingpin --

28:54.087 --> 28:55.987
i believe y'all call him el jefe --

28:56.020 --> 28:57.654
on his yacht, near catalina.

28:57.687 --> 29:00.654
i don't know what you're talking about.

29:00.687 --> 29:02.020
well, that's okay

29:02.053 --> 29:04.821
because we have some pretty important videotape of our own.

29:04.854 --> 29:08.187
it show you shooting ben masters at point-blank range.

29:09.387 --> 29:12.888
and since the murder was so up close and personal,

29:12.920 --> 29:17.187
i'm sure we'll find loads of physical evidence, as well.

29:21.487 --> 29:24.154
you recognize this ring, mr. murphy?

29:24.187 --> 29:26.320
you're wearing it right now.

29:26.354 --> 29:28.654
and you were wearing it on the day the videotape was taken.

29:28.687 --> 29:32.687
would you please remove that ring and set it on the table?

29:35.587 --> 29:38.721
sir, i can compel you to do so.

29:43.287 --> 29:44.821
thank you.

29:45.687 --> 29:47.053
what are you gonna do with it?

29:49.187 --> 29:51.621
when you shoot someone at close range,

29:51.654 --> 29:54.987
tiny bits of their blood and tissue blow back at you.

29:55.020 --> 29:58.888
you're literally walking around with pieces of your victim.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.854
you can wash your hands, but it doesn't come off that easily.

30:01.888 --> 30:07.320
this is the latest in l.a.p.d. technology.

30:11.320 --> 30:14.920
lieutenant provenza, what is that bag lieutenant tao has?

30:14.953 --> 30:18.821
i believe that holds his personal grooming items.

30:24.187 --> 30:26.387
you don't want this to turn red.

30:26.421 --> 30:28.020
okay, what is he doing now?

30:28.053 --> 30:31.654
well, it looks like he is about to spray the suspect's ring

30:31.687 --> 30:35.087
with a little squirt of breath freshener.

30:39.354 --> 30:40.920
it's positive.

30:40.953 --> 30:42.053
oh, man.

30:42.087 --> 30:43.788
lieutenant, now, if you will please

30:43.821 --> 30:45.220
take that ring back to our crime lab,

30:45.254 --> 30:48.421
i'm sure you'll get a match to ben masters' dna.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.788
agent howard, what are you doing here?

30:56.821 --> 30:58.621
i just came from a 12-person stakeout

30:58.654 --> 31:00.621
at ben masters' house in woodland hills.

31:00.654 --> 31:02.687
oh, uh, what were you doing there?

31:02.721 --> 31:04.888
we were at the loft downtown.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.320
do you have the guy?

31:07.953 --> 31:10.020
he's under arrest.

31:13.421 --> 31:15.421
whoa, whoa, whoa! wait!

31:15.454 --> 31:16.987
where are you going?

31:17.020 --> 31:20.087
did you not notice? i just proved you committed murder.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.953
so we're sort of done here.

31:21.987 --> 31:23.754
unless...i mean

31:23.788 --> 31:26.187
are there extenuating circumstances

31:26.220 --> 31:28.020
you might like me to know about?

31:28.053 --> 31:31.521
i mean, did ben masters do something to you?

31:31.554 --> 31:33.654
like, were you being threatened or something?

31:33.687 --> 31:35.721
yes! y-yeah, he was threatening me.

31:35.754 --> 31:38.187
weren't you even gonna ask me about that?

31:39.454 --> 31:41.053
okay.

31:46.920 --> 31:49.187
tell me what he did,

31:49.220 --> 31:51.987
and i'll take it into consideration.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.987
one day last year,

31:57.020 --> 31:59.754
i went by his house... just to say hey.

31:59.788 --> 32:03.320
you could tell he didn't even want the neighbors to see us talking.

32:03.354 --> 32:05.421
like, i'm some scumbag off the street.

32:05.454 --> 32:07.020
okay, whatever, you know.

32:07.053 --> 32:08.721
nice to see you, too, benji.

32:08.754 --> 32:11.154
enjoy your big house, huh?

32:12.154 --> 32:14.287
then, like, three months ago,

32:14.320 --> 32:17.854
out of nowhere, he calls me up.

32:17.888 --> 32:20.621
he's all, "hey, buddy, how's it going?"

32:20.654 --> 32:23.587
said he needed to make some extra cash,

32:23.621 --> 32:26.953
and since i'm a criminal, maybe i could help.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.554
so i hooked him up.

32:29.587 --> 32:32.320
so, you had him carry drugs for you across the border.

32:33.521 --> 32:35.953
it's okay. you can talk about that.

32:35.987 --> 32:38.387
i will not be arresting you for drugs ever.

32:38.421 --> 32:40.220
it's not my job.

32:43.254 --> 32:47.254
he muled for me, and then he kept the coke

32:47.287 --> 32:49.920
in one of those vacant lofts he couldn't sell

32:49.953 --> 32:51.120
and made me a key

32:51.154 --> 32:53.587
so i could pick it up and pay him, you know?

32:53.621 --> 32:54.721
i paid him to do it.

32:54.754 --> 32:56.687
ben was wearing the video recorder

32:56.721 --> 32:58.587
when you spoke to him on the phone.

32:58.621 --> 33:00.854
he said he wanted what you stole from him.

33:00.888 --> 33:02.920
i didn't steal anything.

33:02.953 --> 33:07.387
i borrowed some coke for another deal i had going.

33:07.421 --> 33:09.254
he said he was gonna tell raul

33:09.287 --> 33:11.187
if i didn't pay him back by yesterday,

33:11.220 --> 33:12.888
but i didn't have the money yet.

33:12.920 --> 33:16.120
i told him raul would kill me.

33:16.154 --> 33:18.320
you know what he said?

33:18.354 --> 33:19.821
"better you than me."

33:19.854 --> 33:23.654
after i got him 100 grand and hooked him up with my crew,

33:23.687 --> 33:25.421
he pulls that crap with me.

33:28.821 --> 33:30.020
thank you.

33:30.053 --> 33:32.888
fyi, agent howard in the house.

33:34.154 --> 33:35.621
ben betrayed you.

33:35.654 --> 33:37.621
he tried to get you on camera

33:37.654 --> 33:39.953
saying you stole el jefe's drugs,

33:39.987 --> 33:42.387
-but instead he videotaped you...  -fritz.

33:42.421 --> 33:45.320
hey, will. how you doing?

33:45.354 --> 33:47.187
good, good.

33:47.220 --> 33:48.254
you?

33:48.287 --> 33:50.821
good. yeah. no complaints.

33:50.854 --> 33:51.987
good, good.

33:52.020 --> 33:54.287
you here to see brenda?

33:55.187 --> 33:57.788
i'll just wait here with you.

33:57.821 --> 33:59.387
great.

33:59.421 --> 34:01.120
great.

34:02.888 --> 34:04.487
i didn't want it to happen.

34:04.521 --> 34:06.754
i never killed anybody. i swear on my mother.

34:06.788 --> 34:07.953
w-what am i gonna do?

34:07.987 --> 34:09.953
buzz, better tell the chief the fbi's here.

34:09.987 --> 34:11.754
chief, lieutenant tao says the fbi

34:11.788 --> 34:13.987
is waiting outside your door right now.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.888
dean, i need you to listen to me.

34:17.920 --> 34:21.254
we don't have much time. the fbi will be here any minute.

34:21.286 --> 34:22.888
now, all i have to offer you

34:22.920 --> 34:25.521
is life in prison without parole.

34:25.554 --> 34:26.953
but the fbi wants el jefe,

34:26.987 --> 34:28.888
and they're gonna offer you a deal

34:28.920 --> 34:30.888
in exchange for your cooperation.

34:32.754 --> 34:33.953
what do i have to do?

34:33.987 --> 34:35.120
all you have to do

34:35.154 --> 34:37.120
is wear a little video camera inside your shirt

34:37.154 --> 34:38.621
and get el jefe to tell you

34:38.654 --> 34:40.286
everything the feds want to hear.

34:40.320 --> 34:43.120
this is one case chief johnson won't be closing.

34:43.154 --> 34:45.120
say goodbye, dean murphy.

34:45.154 --> 34:48.487
in about five minutes, he's going to become the property of the fbi.

34:48.521 --> 34:50.754
mm, i wouldn't be so sure.

34:52.454 --> 34:54.353
okay, i --

34:54.387 --> 34:55.687
i can do that.

34:56.953 --> 35:00.087
now, when you go in...

35:00.120 --> 35:02.320
the fbi will try and stay within a hoot and a holler

35:02.354 --> 35:03.587
in case you need their help

35:03.621 --> 35:05.854
'cause it's their job to protect you.

35:05.888 --> 35:07.854
but they won't be able to.

35:07.888 --> 35:08.987
what did she say?

35:09.020 --> 35:10.854
wait, what did you say?

35:10.888 --> 35:13.854
by now, el jefe already knows that you've been picked up by the police.

35:13.888 --> 35:15.354
he probably also knows that ben,

35:15.387 --> 35:17.354
the man you brought into the organization,

35:17.387 --> 35:19.187
was wearing a wire when he was killed.

35:19.220 --> 35:21.053
stop. why -- why are you telling me that --

35:21.087 --> 35:22.421
what do you think is gonna happen

35:22.454 --> 35:24.454
when you're out on his boat in the middle of the ocean

35:24.487 --> 35:26.554
and el jefe suddenly decides he doesn't trust you anymore?

35:26.587 --> 35:30.320
he's gonna tie your feet to an anchor and feed you to the sharks!

35:30.354 --> 35:32.138
you don't even know what kind of deal they're gonna --

35:32.138 --> 35:34.187
and there won't be a thing your fbi handlers can do about it.

35:34.220 --> 35:36.554
-why are you telling me this?  -because i want you to live...

35:38.053 --> 35:39.287
...and do your time.

35:39.320 --> 35:40.953
but the fbi, they don't care about you!

35:40.987 --> 35:43.087
they've got this big investigation.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.187
so, who are you gonna trust, hmm?

35:45.220 --> 35:48.687
i'm telling you, dean -- you may not realize it,

35:48.721 --> 35:52.320
but you are way, way out of your league.

35:52.354 --> 35:55.721
if you want to live, go to jail.

36:01.587 --> 36:03.521
you're offering me

36:03.554 --> 36:06.154
life in prison without parole.

36:07.554 --> 36:10.120
the fbi's gonna offer me a deal.

36:11.454 --> 36:12.854
i'll get protected.

36:12.888 --> 36:14.587
so protected that, in a month or so,

36:14.621 --> 36:16.754
i'll be be watching your murder on tape.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.421
i'll take my chances.

36:41.421 --> 36:43.220
fritzi.

36:45.721 --> 36:48.454
okay, the suspect's all yours.

36:49.621 --> 36:51.154
anything else i should know?

36:51.187 --> 36:52.421
no.

36:52.454 --> 36:55.387
i've prepared him for you as well as i can.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.020
great.

37:04.687 --> 37:07.654
you did your best, brenda.

37:07.687 --> 37:09.587
we can't win 'em all.

37:09.621 --> 37:12.354
i should not have lost this one, will.

37:54.621 --> 37:57.554
um...chief?

37:57.587 --> 37:58.987
chief?

38:01.654 --> 38:03.187
i'm sorry.

38:03.220 --> 38:05.687
this is not what i thought would happen,

38:05.721 --> 38:07.187
and i will...

38:07.220 --> 38:09.354
i will do better -- i will.

38:09.387 --> 38:12.754
and you won't have any problems from me. i swear.

38:18.987 --> 38:20.220
then neither one of you

38:20.254 --> 38:22.754
will mind complying with this direct order.

38:22.788 --> 38:24.521
work it out!

38:24.554 --> 38:28.387
i don't want to hear about this affair again.

38:28.421 --> 38:29.888
ever.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.220
is that understood?

38:31.254 --> 38:33.554
-absolutely.  -yes, ma'am.

38:35.387 --> 38:37.387
the transfer -- give it to me.

38:37.421 --> 38:40.554
transfer, transfer.

38:43.120 --> 38:46.154
i don't come to work every day to watch soap operas,

38:46.187 --> 38:48.387
and i mean it!

38:48.421 --> 38:50.220
dismissed!

39:42.788 --> 39:43.854
hello.

39:43.888 --> 39:45.687
hi.

39:47.354 --> 39:49.587
i've got some good news for you.

39:49.621 --> 39:50.987
what's that?

39:51.020 --> 39:54.120
your friend dean murphy is headed back to l.a.p.d.

39:56.421 --> 39:59.053
didn't the fbi offer him a deal?

39:59.087 --> 40:01.254
oh, yeah. we offered him a deal.

40:01.287 --> 40:03.187
but, you know,

40:03.220 --> 40:06.421
somehow, even after an all-night discussion,

40:06.454 --> 40:09.154
he decided he'd be better off staying in prison.

40:09.187 --> 40:10.554
is that what you told him?

40:10.587 --> 40:12.821
i-i told him the truth.

40:12.854 --> 40:16.721
well, great, great, great.

40:16.754 --> 40:19.287
you closed your case.

40:19.320 --> 40:20.788
that's great.

40:22.387 --> 40:24.654
dean murphy committed premeditated murder.

40:24.687 --> 40:25.953
he confessed to it.

40:25.987 --> 40:28.454
he should go to jail for the rest of his life -- the end.

40:28.487 --> 40:31.320
well, that's one way of looking at it.

40:31.354 --> 40:32.788
here's another.

40:32.821 --> 40:35.187
you came to me for help. i gave it to you.

40:35.220 --> 40:36.754
you took everything i had,

40:36.788 --> 40:38.454
and then you stole my case.

40:38.487 --> 40:41.254
and you made me extremely vulnerable at work.

40:41.287 --> 40:43.421
that's a somewhat milder version

40:43.454 --> 40:44.821
of what your killer did to his friend.

40:44.854 --> 40:45.987
and i got to tell you, brenda,

40:46.020 --> 40:49.521
-i am so sick of this double standard.  -what double standard

40:49.554 --> 40:51.987
you sent me on a needless and very expensive stakeout.

40:52.020 --> 40:54.521
you undermined three years of hard work.

40:54.554 --> 40:57.854
and if i had done anything remotely similar to that --

40:57.888 --> 40:59.521
if i had screwed with your case,

40:59.554 --> 41:02.020
my god, you would have changed the locks on the doors.

41:02.053 --> 41:04.854
i would have been so far out of line,

41:04.888 --> 41:08.154
but here is the difference -- i would know it.

41:08.187 --> 41:10.987
and i would try to correct it somehow.

41:11.020 --> 41:13.521
now, wait a minute. just hold on.

41:13.554 --> 41:14.953
i never lied to you.

41:14.987 --> 41:19.320
i gave you exactly what you asked for -- exactly.

41:19.354 --> 41:21.254
now, i'm sorry.

41:21.287 --> 41:25.320
i-i should have called you when we took dean into custody,

41:25.354 --> 41:27.287
so i apologize for that.

41:29.754 --> 41:31.788
that -- that's what you're sorry for?

41:31.821 --> 41:33.220
yes.

41:33.254 --> 41:34.354
really?

41:35.254 --> 41:36.888
that's it?

41:39.621 --> 41:41.554
apology not accepted.

41:42.621 --> 41:45.053
all i did -- now, wait a minute, fritz.

41:45.087 --> 41:48.187
all i did was try to get the justice system

41:48.220 --> 41:49.654
to work for my victim -- that is all i did.

41:49.687 --> 41:50.721
that's bullshit!

41:50.754 --> 41:52.788
you didn't do it for the justice system!

41:52.821 --> 41:54.554
you didn't do it for the victim!

41:54.587 --> 41:56.220
you did it to close your case!

41:56.254 --> 41:57.421
that's it!

41:57.454 --> 41:59.421
it's obviously the most important thing to you.

41:59.454 --> 42:00.487
it's clearly not me!

42:00.521 --> 42:02.120
and, you know, maybe that's fine,

42:02.154 --> 42:03.920
but, brenda, for once in your life,

42:03.953 --> 42:05.387
be honest with yourself.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.721
i am tired. i am hungry. i am angry.

42:09.754 --> 42:11.187
i'm gonna find my sponsor.

42:11.220 --> 42:13.754
i'm gonna go to a meeting. maybe two.
