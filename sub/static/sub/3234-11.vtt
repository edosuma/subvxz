00:37.005 --> 00:38.739
[sighs]

00:38.773 --> 00:43.174
Yo, I thought I was going
to see some, like, vaginas.

00:46.844 --> 00:50.979
I didn't say she actually
painted vaginas.

00:51.013 --> 00:52.079
I said

00:52.114 --> 00:53.814
some of her paintings

00:53.848 --> 00:56.916
looked like vaginas.

00:57.984 --> 01:00.118
Uh, seriously?

01:00.152 --> 01:02.119
[whispers] Not even close.

01:02.153 --> 01:03.319
[chuckles]

01:03.354 --> 01:06.688
Georgia O'Keeffe painted
all kinds of stuff.

01:06.723 --> 01:10.991
Huh. Everyday items,
her surroundings.

01:11.025 --> 01:15.527
Some of it evoked
an erotic nature.

01:15.562 --> 01:17.062
[snickers]

01:17.096 --> 01:19.530
It's who she was.

01:19.564 --> 01:23.800
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.935
This chick have medical issues?

01:27.036 --> 01:28.336
This particular painting--

01:28.370 --> 01:29.770
Mmm.

01:29.805 --> 01:31.438
...is of a door.

01:33.474 --> 01:35.674
Any other doors
we can check out?

01:35.709 --> 01:38.943
Like, real ones or...

01:39.945 --> 01:41.278
[groans]

01:41.312 --> 01:43.947
You know,
I-I-I don't get it.

01:43.981 --> 01:46.949
Why would anyone paint
a picture of a door

01:46.983 --> 01:50.585
over and over again,
like, dozens of times?

01:50.619 --> 01:51.986
But it wasn't the same.

01:52.020 --> 01:54.388
Uh, yeah, it was.

01:54.422 --> 01:57.023
It was the same subject, but
it was different every time.

01:57.057 --> 01:58.357
The light was different.

01:58.391 --> 01:59.725
Her mood was different.

01:59.759 --> 02:02.293
She saw something new
every time she painted it.

02:02.328 --> 02:05.863
And that's not psycho to you?

02:05.897 --> 02:09.198
Well, then, why should we
do anything more than once?

02:09.233 --> 02:11.900
Should I just smoke
this one cigarette?

02:11.935 --> 02:15.536
Maybe we should only have sex
once if it's the same thing.

02:15.571 --> 02:17.171
Whoa, no--

02:17.205 --> 02:19.473
Should we just watch
one sunset?

02:19.507 --> 02:23.176
Or live just one day.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.977
Because it's new every time.

02:25.011 --> 02:26.712
Each time, it's
a different experience.

02:26.746 --> 02:29.147
Okay, fine.

02:29.181 --> 02:32.983
I guess the cow skull
pictures were cool,

02:33.018 --> 02:35.018
but a door?

02:35.052 --> 02:37.487
I will say it again.

02:37.521 --> 02:39.855
[chuckles] A door.

02:39.890 --> 02:41.056
[snores] [chuckles]

02:41.091 --> 02:42.891
Why not a door?

02:42.926 --> 02:44.759
Sometimes you get fixated
on something,

02:44.794 --> 02:47.194
and you might not even get why.

02:47.229 --> 02:49.763
You open yourself up
and go with the flow,

02:49.798 --> 02:51.498
wherever the universe
takes you.

02:51.532 --> 02:52.565
[snickers]

02:52.600 --> 02:57.503
Okay, so the universe
took her to a door,

02:57.537 --> 02:59.437
and she got all obsessed
with it

02:59.472 --> 03:04.442
and just had to paint it
20 times until it was perfect.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.877
No, I wouldn't say that.
Nothing's perfect.

03:06.911 --> 03:08.579
Yeah?

03:08.613 --> 03:09.913
Well...

03:11.182 --> 03:13.082
Oh, yeah.

03:13.117 --> 03:14.884
Some things.

03:21.524 --> 03:23.124
[giggles]

03:29.198 --> 03:30.899
Oh, that was so sweet,

03:30.933 --> 03:32.802
I think I threw up
in my mouth a little bit.

03:32.836 --> 03:35.038
[laughs]

03:35.073 --> 03:37.474
You can't admit just
for once that I'm right.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.642
Come on.

03:38.677 --> 03:42.046
That O'Keeffe lady
kept trying over and over

03:42.080 --> 03:44.114
until that stupid door

03:44.149 --> 03:46.150
was perfect.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.752
No. That door was her home,
and she loved it.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.923
To me, that's about making
that feeling last.

04:05.370 --> 04:15.071
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:24.154 --> 04:26.322
[machine whirring]

04:27.824 --> 04:30.359
All right, here we go.
You ready?

04:30.393 --> 04:33.529
[labored breathing]

04:34.597 --> 04:36.965
Come on, give me a step.
Give me one step.

04:39.435 --> 04:41.270
[exhales]

04:43.039 --> 04:44.473
Nope.

04:44.507 --> 04:46.074
Nope, that's it.
Take me up.

04:46.109 --> 04:47.609
You can do this, Hank.

04:47.643 --> 04:49.544
Come on, it's supposed to hurt.

04:49.579 --> 04:52.047
Pain is weakness
leaving your body.

04:52.081 --> 04:53.615
Pain is my foot
in your ass, Marie.

04:53.649 --> 04:56.518
Hey, if you can get your leg
up that high, I say go for it.

04:56.552 --> 04:58.953
Take me up. Take me up.
All right, coffee break.

04:58.988 --> 05:01.623
We're gonna let you rest for a minute,
and then we're gonna try it again.

05:01.657 --> 05:03.258
Never mind about your coffee break.
Take me up.

05:03.292 --> 05:05.093
I'm done. I'm done.

05:05.127 --> 05:06.694
[grunts] [machine whirrs]

05:09.598 --> 05:12.333
Come on, Uncle Hank.
You can do it.

05:12.367 --> 05:14.135
How else are you going
to get out of here?

05:14.169 --> 05:15.403
Don't you have any friends?

05:15.437 --> 05:17.338
I mean Jesus, find
something better to do.

05:17.372 --> 05:18.739
I don't need everyone
staring at me

05:18.774 --> 05:21.842
hanging here
like a camel's ball sack.

05:21.877 --> 05:24.779
Hank, he just wants
to be supportive.

05:24.813 --> 05:26.181
It's all right.

05:29.619 --> 05:31.187
All right, I'll be right back.

05:31.221 --> 05:32.855
Okay?
I'll be right back.

05:34.525 --> 05:37.694
You gonna get me out
of here sometime today?

05:37.729 --> 05:39.764
[machine whirring]

05:39.798 --> 05:41.031
Honey--

05:44.901 --> 05:46.034
We got our first bill,

05:46.068 --> 05:48.637
and, you know,
if you're still insistent--

05:48.671 --> 05:49.671
I am.

05:57.313 --> 05:58.580
Prepare yourself.

06:04.154 --> 06:05.454
[whispers] Yeah.

06:05.489 --> 06:09.225
They're gonna start coming in
weekly like that, so...

06:09.259 --> 06:10.660
Okay.

06:10.694 --> 06:12.729
You're sure you can do this?

06:15.733 --> 06:16.733
Yeah.

06:52.095 --> 06:53.996
[scale beeps]

06:54.030 --> 06:55.397
I'll do that.

06:58.602 --> 07:00.202
[scale beeps]
What the hell, man?

07:01.939 --> 07:03.740
What, I can't work a scale now?

07:05.243 --> 07:06.977
This is bullshit.

07:07.011 --> 07:08.712
Just say it.

07:08.746 --> 07:10.014
Just say the words.

07:10.048 --> 07:11.916
You think I'm stealing.
Shh.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.095
[Group leader]
Walk with who you are.

07:30.129 --> 07:33.195
That was a phrase my sponsor
used to use with me

07:33.230 --> 07:35.898
back when I first started
coming to meetings.

07:35.932 --> 07:38.434
It's probably just a different
way of saying "Be yourself."

07:38.468 --> 07:39.802
Right?

07:41.271 --> 07:44.373
But this idea of "walk"

07:44.407 --> 07:45.841
also tells me

07:45.875 --> 07:48.143
that I have to move forward.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.145
Always good advice,
at least for me.

07:50.179 --> 07:54.082
I see we have some
new people here at group,

07:54.116 --> 07:55.350
a couple new faces.

07:55.384 --> 07:57.385
Let's see some hands.

07:57.419 --> 07:58.453
First time?

08:06.294 --> 08:08.696
Great. Welcome.

08:08.730 --> 08:11.331
Maybe we can go around,
introduce ourselves.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.500
Say whatever's on your mind.

08:13.535 --> 08:15.602
How about you?
You want to start us off?

08:17.138 --> 08:18.672
[clears throat]

08:18.706 --> 08:22.743
Yeah. My name is Andrea...

08:22.777 --> 08:24.111
and, uh...

08:27.582 --> 08:30.483
We don't bite.
No judgments.

08:30.518 --> 08:33.653
You can be as open and honest
as you want to be.

08:35.655 --> 08:38.991
Honestly, I don't
want to be here.

08:42.496 --> 08:44.398
All right.
Fair enough.

08:44.432 --> 08:45.866
Who else had their hand up?

08:51.939 --> 08:53.839
Hey. 'Sup?

08:53.874 --> 08:56.141
My name's Jesse.

08:56.176 --> 08:58.010
Why, hello.

08:58.044 --> 08:59.178
My name is Brandon.

09:00.981 --> 09:03.549
And this is, I believe, Peter?

09:03.583 --> 09:05.617
Right. I'm Peter.
How are you?

09:14.827 --> 09:17.929
Look, I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

09:17.964 --> 09:20.298
It's gonna get a little
slower smuggling product

09:20.333 --> 09:23.134
with Grandpa Anus
watching every move I make.

09:23.168 --> 09:26.503
But don't worry.
I'll keep it flowing.

09:26.538 --> 09:28.371
Great. Right on.

09:28.406 --> 09:30.006
Yeah.

09:30.041 --> 09:32.375
So how's it selling?

09:32.409 --> 09:33.843
Mad volume?

09:33.877 --> 09:37.278
Yeah. It's, uh...

09:37.313 --> 09:39.013
You know, it's, um...

09:40.616 --> 09:41.817
It's not so good.

09:43.121 --> 09:44.488
What do you mean?

09:44.522 --> 09:46.690
How much have you sold?

09:46.724 --> 09:48.091
I sold a teenth.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.759
One teenth?

09:49.793 --> 09:51.126
That's it?

09:51.161 --> 09:52.828
Yeah.

09:52.863 --> 09:53.829
To who?

09:53.864 --> 09:55.431
To him.

09:57.534 --> 10:00.268
Look, it's not so easy
selling to these people.

10:00.303 --> 10:02.170
They're here trying
to better themselves.

10:02.204 --> 10:03.304
Yeah, there's, like,

10:03.339 --> 10:05.840
positivity and stuff
going on here.

10:05.874 --> 10:09.577
I'm out risking my ass
to get product for you two,

10:09.611 --> 10:12.446
and you're too pussy to sell?

10:12.480 --> 10:14.481
You're pathetic.

10:15.850 --> 10:18.985
You know what?
I want it back. All of it.

10:19.020 --> 10:20.720
I'll sell it myself.

10:20.755 --> 10:22.522
Come on, man.
Don't be like that.

10:22.556 --> 10:25.191
Selling to these people, it's
like shooting a baby in the face.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.325
It's not natural.

10:26.360 --> 10:28.728
Yeah, Jesse,
it's not easy like you think.

10:28.763 --> 10:33.035
I'll show you exactly
how easy it is.

10:52.496 --> 10:54.030
Oh, hey. Sorry.

10:54.065 --> 10:55.065
No. Go ahead.

10:55.099 --> 10:57.701
It's Andrea, right?

10:57.735 --> 10:59.536
Yeah.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.401
Hey, um, my name's Jesse,

11:01.435 --> 11:05.737
and, uh, I don't really
want to be here, either.

11:09.306 --> 11:11.373
Oh, um--

11:11.407 --> 11:12.407
Sorry.
[chuckles]

11:12.441 --> 11:13.441
Thanks.

11:33.122 --> 11:36.224
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

11:36.259 --> 11:37.259
No.

11:38.561 --> 11:39.761
Your dad is.

11:45.402 --> 11:47.870
[Walter, Jr.] How'd you get her 
to sleep so quick?

11:47.905 --> 11:49.405
Are you that boring?

11:50.674 --> 11:52.175
I'm comforting.

11:53.777 --> 11:55.545
I'm a comforting presence.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.984
[whispers] There we go.

12:01.018 --> 12:02.119
Shh, shh.

12:06.359 --> 12:07.726
Hey, so check it out.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.161
Huh?

12:09.196 --> 12:11.196
See what that means?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.331
Check out the date.

12:12.366 --> 12:15.800
Next Thursday
is officially six months

12:15.834 --> 12:18.333
that I have had my learner's,

12:18.367 --> 12:21.032
which means I can
get my provisional

12:21.066 --> 12:23.364
and start driving by myself.

12:25.629 --> 12:27.960
Since when? You don't
turn 16 for two more months.

12:27.994 --> 12:30.563
It doesn't matter.
It's a provisional.

12:30.597 --> 12:33.699
Look it up. They changed
the law, like, 10 years ago.

12:33.733 --> 12:35.768
Oh, yeah? Well,
I didn't vote for that.

12:35.802 --> 12:37.403
Doesn't matter
if you voted for it.

12:37.437 --> 12:39.571
It's the law.

12:39.605 --> 12:40.772
So both of you start thinking

12:40.806 --> 12:42.474
about what kind of car
you want to buy me.

12:42.508 --> 12:43.842
Mmm.

12:43.876 --> 12:45.143
I think I'd be good with either

12:45.177 --> 12:48.413
an old IROC or a 'Stang.

12:48.447 --> 12:50.949
Ah, a 'Stang.

12:50.984 --> 12:52.384
Hmm.
Mm-hmm.

12:52.418 --> 12:55.087
How about something with
playing cards in the spokes?

12:55.121 --> 12:57.656
Makes a nice
motor-y sound, you know?

12:57.690 --> 12:59.191
[imitates motor clicking]
[chuckles]

12:59.225 --> 13:01.694
[both laughing]

13:01.728 --> 13:03.996
Yeah, yeah. You're not
gonna get off that easy.

13:04.030 --> 13:08.400
Well, I-- I think
that this is, um--

13:08.434 --> 13:12.004
We should probably table
this discussion for later.

13:12.038 --> 13:13.839
Your dad and I have
a couple things

13:13.874 --> 13:15.608
we need to talk about, so--

13:15.642 --> 13:16.742
Okay.

13:18.645 --> 13:21.914
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback

13:21.949 --> 13:24.284
in Grabber Lime

13:24.318 --> 13:25.819
with a shaker hood.

13:25.853 --> 13:26.853
Mmm.

13:26.888 --> 13:28.522
'Stang.

13:28.556 --> 13:30.556
I want to write that down
so I don't forget.

13:30.590 --> 13:33.057
Oh, darn it. No pencil!

13:33.092 --> 13:34.924
[groans] [laughing]

13:58.445 --> 14:01.013
What is Ice Station Zebra
Associates?

14:03.750 --> 14:07.086
It's a loan-out.
It's fine.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.421
Whose loan-out?

14:09.455 --> 14:12.090
It's fine. Really.

14:13.325 --> 14:16.561
I...have a guy.

14:16.596 --> 14:18.396
Okay.

14:18.431 --> 14:21.433
Um, does your guy know

14:21.467 --> 14:24.002
the tax code and regulations
in New Mexico?

14:24.036 --> 14:26.471
'Cause there's very
specific paperwork

14:26.506 --> 14:27.939
that has to be submitted
quarterly on this.

14:27.974 --> 14:30.808
Yes. My guy is a top...

14:30.843 --> 14:31.809
guy.

14:31.844 --> 14:32.810
Who is he?

14:32.845 --> 14:34.211
Uh.
What's his name?

14:34.246 --> 14:35.779
What are his qualifications?

14:35.813 --> 14:41.121
Walt, this money has
to be unimpeachable

14:41.155 --> 14:44.256
when it reaches Hank and Marie.

14:44.291 --> 14:46.792
And it is. It will be.

14:46.827 --> 14:48.527
But how do I know that?

14:48.562 --> 14:50.763
I mean, apparently, you can't
even tell me the man's name.

14:50.797 --> 14:51.798
Oh. Jesus.

14:51.832 --> 14:54.600
Skyler, do you
really want to know?

14:54.635 --> 14:55.935
I mean, do you really
want to know?

14:59.973 --> 15:00.972
Really?

15:07.511 --> 15:10.011
[man coughing]

15:16.550 --> 15:18.284
[coughing continues]

15:32.697 --> 15:33.831
[door closes]

15:33.865 --> 15:36.032
[Saul]
Hello. Welcome.

15:36.067 --> 15:37.934
What a pleasure it is
to have you.

15:37.968 --> 15:40.236
I'm just gonna call you
Skyler, if that's okay.

15:40.270 --> 15:41.703
It's a lovely name.

15:41.738 --> 15:45.173
Reminds me
of a big beautiful sky.

15:45.207 --> 15:47.041
Walt never told me
how lucky he was--

15:47.075 --> 15:49.977
prior to recent
unfortunate events.

15:50.011 --> 15:51.611
Clearly, his taste in women

15:51.646 --> 15:53.380
is the same as his taste
in lawyers--

15:53.414 --> 15:55.415
only the very best

15:55.449 --> 15:59.018
with just the right
amount of dirty.

15:59.052 --> 16:00.852
[laughs] That's a joke.

16:00.887 --> 16:03.021
That's a joke.

16:03.055 --> 16:05.824
It's funny because you are
so clearly very classy.

16:05.858 --> 16:08.826
Here. Please, sit down.

16:08.861 --> 16:13.564
So Walt tells me that you have
some concerns I can alleviate.

16:13.599 --> 16:16.503
Uh, yes, I do.
I have...

16:17.674 --> 16:19.109
concerns.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.384
If we're going
to go down this road,

16:22.418 --> 16:24.022
and clearly we are

16:24.056 --> 16:25.425
for the sake of
my brother-in-law.

16:25.460 --> 16:27.798
I've heard about him.

16:27.832 --> 16:29.699
He's an American hero.

16:31.302 --> 16:34.070
At any rate,
I need some assurances

16:34.105 --> 16:35.872
that we're gonna go
about this in a manner

16:35.906 --> 16:38.741
that is extremely safe
and cautious.

16:38.776 --> 16:42.011
Fair enough. I'll walk you
through the process.

16:42.046 --> 16:43.246
First step is something

16:43.280 --> 16:46.382
we like to call
money laundering, all right?

16:46.417 --> 16:50.486
Take your money, represented
by, say, these jelly beans.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.654
You know, I'm a bookkeeper-- Then I--

16:52.689 --> 16:55.591
...so I actually know
what money laundering is.

16:55.625 --> 16:56.925
Uh-huh.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.461
Well...
Yeah.

16:59.495 --> 17:01.696
And, as with most things,

17:01.731 --> 17:03.799
the devil is in the details.

17:03.833 --> 17:05.133
So to begin with,

17:05.167 --> 17:07.935
what are we saying is
the source of this money?

17:07.970 --> 17:09.837
That's simple.

17:09.872 --> 17:13.107
Walt here actually
came up with a great story

17:13.141 --> 17:14.308
about gambling winnings.

17:14.342 --> 17:16.443
Blackjack, right?
Some card counting?

17:16.477 --> 17:19.279
Well, actually,
that was Skyler's idea.

17:19.313 --> 17:22.248
[clears throat] Well,

17:22.282 --> 17:24.451
you grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

17:24.484 --> 17:26.486
Well, there you have it.

17:26.520 --> 17:27.788
I'll generate

17:27.821 --> 17:29.624
false currency
transaction reports

17:29.658 --> 17:30.726
out the wazoo.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.598
As well as
the necessary W-2Gs.

17:33.632 --> 17:36.002
I know a couple casino managers

17:36.036 --> 17:38.772
who will jump at the chance
to report false losses.

17:38.807 --> 17:40.107
It's a win-win for everyone.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.944
Yeah, but you can't
sell that for very long.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Way ahead of you.

17:45.014 --> 17:48.684
We declare just enough
so as not to arouse suspicion,

17:48.718 --> 17:51.955
then Walt's one-time winnings
become seed money

17:51.989 --> 17:53.556
for an investment.

17:53.591 --> 17:55.625
Investment in what?

17:55.660 --> 17:57.894
Drum roll please.
Wait for it.

17:57.929 --> 17:59.062
Laser tag.

18:01.867 --> 18:02.934
Laser tag.

18:02.968 --> 18:05.169
7,000 square feet
of rollicking fun

18:05.204 --> 18:07.606
in the heart of northern
Bernlillo County.

18:08.641 --> 18:10.676
Laser tag?

18:10.710 --> 18:13.713
Yeah. There's guns
and glow lights and--

18:13.747 --> 18:15.682
Kids wear the vests,

18:15.716 --> 18:16.749
and they have to
split into teams--

18:16.784 --> 18:18.451
Right. No, actually,
I know what it is.

18:18.486 --> 18:21.155
It's just that in relation to Walt, it's--

18:21.189 --> 18:24.525
I mean, it doesn't
make any sense.

18:24.559 --> 18:27.095
It makes more sense
than you two being together.

18:27.129 --> 18:29.097
I'm still trying to figure out
how that happened.

18:29.132 --> 18:31.266
Do you even know Walt?
I mean...

18:31.301 --> 18:34.970
how would he of all people
buy a laser tag business?

18:35.004 --> 18:36.605
It doesn't add up.

18:36.639 --> 18:38.473
It adds up perfectly.
Walt's a scientist.

18:38.508 --> 18:40.175
Scientists love lasers.

18:41.811 --> 18:43.445
Plus they got
bumper boats, so--

18:43.480 --> 18:45.114
Hey, everybody.

18:45.148 --> 18:48.651
Walt suddenly decided
to invest in laser tag.

18:48.685 --> 18:50.219
Just out of the blue.

18:50.253 --> 18:52.988
Really? That's what we're
supposed to tell people,

18:53.023 --> 18:56.458
our family, our friends,
the government?

18:56.493 --> 18:57.961
Let me bottom line
this for you.

18:57.995 --> 19:00.464
You don't need to be involved.

19:00.499 --> 19:03.035
Because I've been doing this
for a lot of years--

19:03.070 --> 19:04.971
successfully,
believe it or not--

19:05.006 --> 19:07.609
without your help.

19:07.643 --> 19:10.446
So thank you for stopping by.

19:28.802 --> 19:30.403
You want a beer or something?

19:32.006 --> 19:33.407
Or something.

19:34.409 --> 19:35.376
What do you mean?

19:35.410 --> 19:36.744
[laughs]

19:36.778 --> 19:38.546
Like beer.

19:38.580 --> 19:40.015
[laughs]

19:40.049 --> 19:41.416
I'm clean out of anything else.

19:44.321 --> 19:47.523
Even if I wasn't,
we're not supposed to.

19:48.592 --> 19:50.527
Yeah.

19:50.561 --> 19:52.696
I've heard it over

19:52.731 --> 19:54.265
and over

19:54.299 --> 19:56.167
and over again.

19:59.305 --> 20:01.607
You know, don't you think
it's ridiculous

20:01.641 --> 20:05.277
that society says beer is okay

20:05.312 --> 20:10.183
and a little hit
of something sweet is wrong?

20:10.218 --> 20:12.219
I mean...

20:12.253 --> 20:14.689
what's the point of shutting
yourself off completely

20:14.723 --> 20:18.860
from something that
lifts you off the ground?

20:22.532 --> 20:25.335
I spend so much energy

20:25.369 --> 20:29.907
fighting the urge not to use,

20:29.941 --> 20:32.276
and I feel like crap
because of it.

20:36.415 --> 20:39.151
I know. It's just...

20:39.186 --> 20:40.286
What?

20:42.389 --> 20:46.059
I can't get caught using again.

20:49.931 --> 20:51.799
See, the thing is...

20:53.869 --> 20:55.971
[whispering] not to get caught.

20:59.176 --> 21:01.711
You ever try that blue stuff
that's going around?

21:03.047 --> 21:04.781
[exhales]

21:04.816 --> 21:07.718
Just a little gas in the tank,

21:07.752 --> 21:11.455
and suddenly...

21:11.490 --> 21:13.224
everything is interesting.

21:16.095 --> 21:18.530
Man, I wish I can make
that feeling last.

21:23.670 --> 21:26.205
Like I said,
I got nothing here.

21:29.375 --> 21:32.311
What if I could get some?

21:37.517 --> 21:38.517
[door opens]

21:39.852 --> 21:40.952
Mommy! Mommy!

21:40.986 --> 21:42.253
Hey, B!

21:42.287 --> 21:45.421
Oh, your Nana
brought you home early.

21:47.622 --> 21:50.357
Grandma, I thought
you were keeping Brock today.

21:50.391 --> 21:53.593
I was.
Then I saw your car.

21:53.627 --> 21:55.327
I thought you had a meeting.

21:55.361 --> 21:57.796
I did, but we changed the time.

21:57.831 --> 22:00.031
Grandma, this is Jesse.

22:00.066 --> 22:01.433
He's from the meeting.

22:01.467 --> 22:03.301
He's like a sponsor.

22:03.336 --> 22:05.370
Jesse, this is Grandma.

22:07.805 --> 22:10.939
[speaks Spanish]

22:13.175 --> 22:17.877
[speaking Spanish]

22:21.213 --> 22:23.314
Jesse, this is Brock.

22:25.451 --> 22:27.218
So, you, uh--

22:27.253 --> 22:29.354
You have a kid, huh?

22:29.388 --> 22:30.655
What's up?

22:31.690 --> 22:32.890
Brock, huh?

22:34.159 --> 22:35.625
That's a cool name.

22:37.428 --> 22:39.962
Here.
Give it up.

22:50.139 --> 22:52.273
Brock is almost 6.

22:52.307 --> 22:55.109
You okay with kids?

22:55.143 --> 22:57.610
What? Yeah, he's cool.

22:59.579 --> 23:01.713
Okay, Brock is gonna
go play in his room

23:01.747 --> 23:03.248
while the big people talk.

23:03.282 --> 23:06.216
He's gonna go play with his
Legos and his cars

23:06.251 --> 23:08.184
Say "Bye, Jesse."
Bye, Jesse.

23:20.354 --> 23:22.849
Safe and cautious,
that's all I'm asking,

23:22.884 --> 23:26.447
and that man is neither.

23:26.482 --> 23:29.845
I'll admit, he comes across
like a circus clown.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.077
But he actually knows
what he's doing.

23:33.111 --> 23:34.942
Safe and cautious is you

23:34.976 --> 23:36.874
not being involved
in this at all.

23:36.908 --> 23:38.573
Well, it's a little
late on that.

23:38.607 --> 23:41.938
This is what happens when you decide
to pay our bills with drug money.

23:47.735 --> 23:52.535
Skyler, this isn't just about
what happened before.

23:55.703 --> 23:59.470
My involvement
in this is ongoing.

24:01.570 --> 24:02.769
Understand?

24:05.103 --> 24:06.402
I can't just quit.

24:08.902 --> 24:11.967
I have something of a contract.

24:12.001 --> 24:15.135
It's all very safe
and professional

24:15.170 --> 24:16.802
and structured.

24:17.703 --> 24:19.403
I can't simply quit.

24:29.968 --> 24:30.967
Where are you going?

24:46.609 --> 24:51.708
If you're gonna launder money,
Walt, at least do it right.

25:10.992 --> 25:13.660
You worked here four years.

25:13.694 --> 25:15.461
It's a business you understand.

25:15.496 --> 25:17.429
It's a story
people will believe.

25:17.464 --> 25:20.365
Not laser tag. This.

25:20.399 --> 25:22.300
This is what we buy.

25:23.869 --> 25:24.869
You.

25:27.205 --> 25:28.505
This is what you buy.

25:53.727 --> 25:55.127
[muttering]

25:58.431 --> 26:01.367
Hey, uh, Jesse, right?

26:02.535 --> 26:04.169
Brandon. Peter.

26:04.204 --> 26:05.804
How goes it?
Hanging in there?

26:05.838 --> 26:08.940
Please, just--
Dumb ass.

26:08.974 --> 26:12.577
Sorry, man. I was trying
to keep it on the DL.

26:12.612 --> 26:16.915
So you and that girl,
you do the deed yet?

26:16.949 --> 26:18.717
Do what?

26:18.751 --> 26:22.554
You know, sell to her.

26:24.490 --> 26:26.223
What are you two
even doing here?

26:28.193 --> 26:29.260
What do you mean?

26:29.294 --> 26:32.362
You can't get
your nut up to sell.

26:32.397 --> 26:33.864
What's the point
of even coming?

26:33.898 --> 26:36.700
Homie, I'm on, like, step 5.

26:36.734 --> 26:38.001
Deuce, yo.

26:38.036 --> 26:39.102
I'm catching up.

26:45.543 --> 26:46.943
Whatever.

26:46.978 --> 26:48.311
Later.

26:53.650 --> 26:55.751
Dude needs to come
into the fold.

26:58.154 --> 26:59.187
[Badger] Yep.

27:00.322 --> 27:02.689
Oh, you know,

27:02.724 --> 27:05.124
I have magical powers.

27:05.158 --> 27:06.158
You want to see?

27:08.928 --> 27:09.961
Ready?

27:13.598 --> 27:14.766
That's not real.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.338
[laughs] [whispers] It is real.

27:16.373 --> 27:18.277
All right, do you want
to see something that's real?

27:18.311 --> 27:20.012
Look at this.
Watch this.

27:21.315 --> 27:22.515
Ready?

27:28.721 --> 27:30.555
You like that?

27:30.590 --> 27:33.625
That's science and stuff.
Makes it do that.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.829
Do it again.

27:36.864 --> 27:37.997
Let Jesse eat
his dinner, Brock.

27:38.031 --> 27:38.998
It's okay.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.099
It's okay.

27:40.133 --> 27:41.533
Want to see it again?

27:41.568 --> 27:43.535
Could you do a trick
with firecrackers?

27:43.569 --> 27:45.370
Firecrackers.

27:45.405 --> 27:50.610
You know, I don't have
any firecrackers on me.

27:50.645 --> 27:51.946
Who does tricks
with firecrackers?

27:51.980 --> 27:53.448
Tomás.

27:53.482 --> 27:56.618
Tomás does tricks
with firecrackers, huh?

27:56.652 --> 27:57.786
Who's Tomás?

27:57.820 --> 27:59.087
He's my kid brother.

27:59.121 --> 28:01.022
Yeah?

28:01.056 --> 28:02.423
And we don't talk about him.

28:03.558 --> 28:06.328
Come on.
Eat your food, Brock.

28:08.999 --> 28:10.466
[Jesse] Can I have a chip?

28:10.500 --> 28:12.001
I'm gonna steal your chip.

28:12.035 --> 28:13.602
[Brock] Hey, that's mine.

28:15.806 --> 28:18.141
[Saul] That's it?
That's what you want to buy?

28:18.175 --> 28:19.909
[Walt] People will
believe it at least.

28:19.944 --> 28:21.311
[chuckles]

28:21.345 --> 28:23.380
I worked here for four years.

28:23.414 --> 28:25.649
Wax on, wax off.
Was that you?

28:25.683 --> 28:29.786
Hey, how come you guys always get
with the air freshener, huh?

28:29.820 --> 28:31.654
I explicitly say
I want no air freshener,

28:31.689 --> 28:32.989
and every time I drive away

28:33.024 --> 28:35.058
smelling like an Alpine w3-- house.

28:37.094 --> 28:40.163
All due respect, I don't see it.
So I vote no.

28:40.197 --> 28:43.496
Makes a better story
than your laser tag.

28:43.531 --> 28:46.126
Is that you talking
or Yoko Ono?

28:46.160 --> 28:48.458
She has a point.

28:48.492 --> 28:51.096
It makes more sense
that I invest right here.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.697
Based on her years
of experience

28:52.732 --> 28:55.266
in money laundering, I suppose.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.968
Let me tell you something.

28:57.003 --> 28:59.404
If you're committed enough,
you can make any story work.

28:59.438 --> 29:02.273
I once convinced a woman
that I was Kevin Costner.

29:02.308 --> 29:04.975
And it worked
because I believed it.

29:05.010 --> 29:07.678
It has nothing to do
with the story.

29:07.712 --> 29:10.447
Besides, this dump
isn't gonna work

29:10.482 --> 29:11.849
because it doesn't have
a Danny.

29:11.883 --> 29:13.384
Okay?
There's no Danny here.

29:14.786 --> 29:17.521
What in God's name is a Danny?

29:17.556 --> 29:20.090
Danny runs the laser tag.

29:20.125 --> 29:22.493
Danny is the guy
who had a vision.

29:22.527 --> 29:23.994
Where others saw a dirt lot,

29:24.028 --> 29:27.097
he saw black lights,
rubber aliens,

29:27.132 --> 29:29.500
teenagers running around
with ray guns, right?

29:29.534 --> 29:31.902
It was like Bugsy Siegel
in the desert.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.970
And when the stock market
took a shit

29:34.005 --> 29:35.438
and Danny got into trouble,

29:35.472 --> 29:37.040
he went searching for exactly

29:37.074 --> 29:39.342
the type of situation
that we're offering.

29:39.376 --> 29:41.678
Danny will look the other way

29:41.712 --> 29:44.013
to keep his dream afloat.

29:44.048 --> 29:46.783
In other words, Danny
can be trusted completely.

29:46.817 --> 29:51.020
That guy-- the guy with the
eyebrows that won't quit--

29:51.055 --> 29:52.155
is he a Danny?

29:52.189 --> 29:53.456
[no audible dialogue]

29:53.490 --> 29:54.991
You buy this place,

29:55.025 --> 29:56.526
all you got is a big building

29:56.560 --> 29:57.660
that squirts water.

29:57.694 --> 30:00.162
You got no Danny here.

30:12.609 --> 30:14.710
You want to stay for dinner?

30:14.745 --> 30:15.778
Yeah.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.047
Thanks.

30:19.249 --> 30:20.649
What time is it?

30:22.853 --> 30:23.953
Early still.

30:28.225 --> 30:29.325
So...

30:32.329 --> 30:35.064
[chuckles] What?

30:35.098 --> 30:37.032
I thought maybe,

30:37.067 --> 30:38.634
if you're holding,

30:38.668 --> 30:40.536
we can do something.

30:42.038 --> 30:43.972
What?

30:44.007 --> 30:47.976
You know, that blue stuff
you were talking about?

30:48.011 --> 30:50.245
Maybe you had a line on some.

30:50.280 --> 30:53.749
Wait. Whoa. What?

30:55.418 --> 30:58.019
I thought you said
the kid is coming home.

30:58.054 --> 31:00.055
Yeah, in a few hours.

31:01.190 --> 31:03.258
And you seriously
want to get high?

31:03.292 --> 31:06.761
I don't know what you're
getting so pissed about.

31:06.796 --> 31:09.231
You're the one who
brought it up the other day.

31:09.265 --> 31:12.100
Yeah, that was before
I found out you got a kid.

31:13.302 --> 31:15.036
What kind of mother are you?

31:15.071 --> 31:17.305
What?

31:17.340 --> 31:18.973
You heard me.
What kind of mom gets wasted

31:19.007 --> 31:20.608
with a little kid
to take care of?

31:25.113 --> 31:28.215
Nobody can say
I don't take care of my son.

31:28.250 --> 31:31.085
You gonna come
in my house and judge me?

31:31.119 --> 31:32.186
Like you got no responsibility,

31:32.220 --> 31:33.754
so it's okay
for you to get high.

31:33.789 --> 31:35.322
Look, I-- What do you know about me?

31:35.357 --> 31:36.857
I take care of my baby.

31:36.891 --> 31:38.158
I'll do anything for him.

31:38.193 --> 31:42.696
The day Brock was born,
I swore...

31:42.730 --> 31:45.732
I won't let what happened
to Tomás happen to my son.

31:47.534 --> 31:48.801
I'll die first.

31:50.604 --> 31:51.737
Sorry. I--

31:53.806 --> 31:54.839
I just--

31:59.645 --> 32:02.747
Look, I'll get out
of here if you want.

32:02.781 --> 32:04.748
That's what you want
to do, then go.

32:04.783 --> 32:06.750
It's not what I want.

32:06.784 --> 32:11.053
Look, I was out of line
talking about that stuff.

32:22.631 --> 32:24.064
We both were.

32:27.469 --> 32:29.170
You're right.

32:29.204 --> 32:32.740
I don't know what
you've been through.

32:32.774 --> 32:34.775
You can tell me if you want.

32:39.047 --> 32:42.184
This whole neighborhood
is run by gangs.

32:42.218 --> 32:45.293
They run the drugs,
control the streets.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.870
And they sort of took Tomás in.

32:53.373 --> 32:55.775
No dad around.

32:55.809 --> 32:59.812
8 years old,
they got Tomás slinging.

33:01.281 --> 33:02.948
Part of some crew.

33:05.385 --> 33:08.721
Then, when he was 10...

33:08.755 --> 33:11.624
for some initiation
or something...

33:14.494 --> 33:16.028
they made him kill somebody.

33:19.232 --> 33:21.934
I heard the rumors.
I didn't believe it at first.

33:21.968 --> 33:23.101
[exhales]

33:25.738 --> 33:27.572
But then I saw him,
like, a weekater.

33:31.511 --> 33:34.312
He told me, yeah, he did it.

33:36.649 --> 33:38.250
They gave Tomás a gun.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.486
Gave him a choice.

33:42.722 --> 33:44.289
Him or some dude.

33:46.726 --> 33:47.926
So he did it.

33:50.162 --> 33:51.896
Told me all about it
like it was nothing.

33:53.732 --> 33:56.134
Who did he say he killed?

33:57.436 --> 33:58.936
Some dealer...

34:00.973 --> 34:01.939
[smacks lips]

34:01.973 --> 34:03.741
from some outside crew.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.276
Right around the corner
from here,

34:06.311 --> 34:08.212
over off the Central.

34:11.014 --> 34:14.351
Just rode up on his bike
and shot him.

34:18.289 --> 34:20.023
Off the Central?

34:21.926 --> 34:24.527
Like, over by the train tracks?

34:26.764 --> 34:28.297
When was this?

34:30.067 --> 34:31.701
A few months back.

34:36.306 --> 34:38.141
What else did he tell you?

34:43.414 --> 34:45.915
He shot the guy
right through the neck.

34:47.551 --> 34:49.119
Shot him dead.

34:52.590 --> 34:55.324
Just because he was
working the wrong corner.

35:01.365 --> 35:03.132
It won't happen again.

35:04.835 --> 35:06.636
Not to my son.

35:16.933 --> 35:18.734
[monitor beeping]

35:23.440 --> 35:24.773
Guess what.

35:26.876 --> 35:28.210
People who say "Guess what"

35:28.245 --> 35:30.847
and then actually
expect you to guess--

35:30.881 --> 35:32.782
I hate those people.

35:32.816 --> 35:34.683
Well, I just heard

35:34.717 --> 35:39.554
about a certain patient
named Schrader-comma-Hank

35:39.589 --> 35:42.592
who is going to be released
at the end of this week.

35:43.762 --> 35:45.463
Isn't that fantastic?

35:47.232 --> 35:49.734
Are they planning on rolling me
out the front door at least,

35:49.768 --> 35:51.669
or they'll put me
on a greased plank

35:51.703 --> 35:53.471
and, uh, slide me
out the window?

35:53.505 --> 35:54.906
Hey.

35:54.940 --> 35:56.340
Listen, I don't care

35:56.375 --> 35:58.643
what any damned
insurance company thinks.

35:58.677 --> 36:01.213
I'm not leaving here
until I'm well.

36:01.247 --> 36:03.815
Hank, this isn't
about insurance.

36:03.849 --> 36:06.017
I've talked to everybody,
and they all say

36:06.052 --> 36:08.086
that you are healthy
enough to go home.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.922
Oh, I'm healthy
enough, huh? Yeah.

36:09.956 --> 36:12.024
Hank, you get stronger
every day.

36:12.058 --> 36:14.260
You don't need to be
in a hospital.

36:14.294 --> 36:17.730
In this condition, yeah, I do.

36:17.764 --> 36:19.732
You'll be just as comfortable at home

36:19.766 --> 36:20.833
as you are here.

36:20.867 --> 36:22.568
You'll have all the same equipment--

36:22.603 --> 36:24.337
All the same equipment?
What--

36:24.371 --> 36:25.772
The equipment--
...does that mean?

36:25.806 --> 36:27.073
...that you have here
that you need.

36:27.108 --> 36:28.575
Short term.

36:28.609 --> 36:31.044
You'll do your PT at home,

36:31.079 --> 36:34.682
and it'll be great
because you'll be home.

36:34.716 --> 36:37.018
Wait till you see the bedroom.

36:37.052 --> 36:38.653
I had them move the plasma in.

36:38.687 --> 36:40.955
I know that's how
you always wanted it,

36:40.989 --> 36:43.424
and you only had to get shot
to get it, right?

36:43.459 --> 36:45.626
I got you a new bed.

36:45.661 --> 36:47.094
A hospital bed?

36:47.128 --> 36:49.062
Well--

36:49.097 --> 36:50.897
You put a hospital bed
in my bedroom?

36:52.233 --> 36:55.635
Hank, you'll be home.

36:55.669 --> 36:58.672
You get that out of my house.

36:58.706 --> 37:00.941
You hear me, Marie?

37:00.975 --> 37:02.576
Today.

37:02.610 --> 37:04.477
Hank--

37:04.512 --> 37:06.212
I leave this hospital

37:06.246 --> 37:09.782
when I walk out of here,
you understand?

37:11.384 --> 37:13.152
And not before.

37:16.323 --> 37:18.591
[Skyler scoffs] What's a Danny?

37:18.626 --> 37:20.759
Danny is an accomplice,

37:20.794 --> 37:23.029
someone who's in on the scheme,

37:23.063 --> 37:25.532
who knows about laundering,

37:25.566 --> 37:29.335
who's paid to look
the other way.

37:29.369 --> 37:31.003
Now, while I agree with you

37:31.037 --> 37:33.540
that laser tag is a hard sell,

37:33.574 --> 37:35.109
without a Danny,

37:35.144 --> 37:37.346
the car wash
isn't really an option.

37:37.381 --> 37:40.850
And he can't get you
another Danny

37:40.884 --> 37:42.552
to run the car wash?

37:42.586 --> 37:44.588
Easier said than done,

37:44.622 --> 37:48.125
if we're looking
for someone trustworthy.

38:01.306 --> 38:02.673
What about me?

38:05.677 --> 38:07.512
What about you?

38:07.546 --> 38:09.680
Me.

38:11.617 --> 38:13.050
I'll be the Danny.

38:13.085 --> 38:16.688
No. No. No, Skyler.
That is not a good idea.

38:16.722 --> 38:19.157
I'm perfectly capable
of managing a small business.

38:19.191 --> 38:21.226
A legal business, not this.

38:21.260 --> 38:22.627
Who else could we trust?

38:22.662 --> 38:24.863
No.
Walt.

38:24.898 --> 38:26.698
I'm in this.

38:26.733 --> 38:29.867
And if I'm in it,
I'm going to do it right.

38:29.902 --> 38:32.370
You are not in this.
You are not--

38:32.404 --> 38:34.106
We're married.
How am I not in this?

38:34.140 --> 38:36.708
We are not married,
Skyler. We're divorced.

38:45.752 --> 38:47.420
Right?

38:49.924 --> 38:55.596
I never actually got around
to filing the papers.

38:59.234 --> 39:01.202
Married couples
can't be compelled

39:01.236 --> 39:03.571
to testify against one another.

39:05.975 --> 39:07.575
So there's that.

39:32.568 --> 39:33.567
Jesse!

39:34.734 --> 39:36.264
Jesse.

39:37.331 --> 39:38.697
Respirator.

39:40.163 --> 39:41.229
Right.

39:45.468 --> 39:47.803

Yes?

40:08.879 --> 40:11.177
Uh-huh.

40:11.211 --> 40:13.108
Yes. All right.

40:13.143 --> 40:14.441
Okay.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.607
I'll be there.

40:20.310 --> 40:22.145
What was that?

40:24.047 --> 40:25.781
An invitation.

40:40.495 --> 40:41.728
[doorbell rings]

40:45.132 --> 40:47.801
Ah. Walter.
You're right on time.

40:47.835 --> 40:49.669
Please, come in.

40:58.445 --> 41:01.280
I hope you like paila marina.

41:01.314 --> 41:03.482
It's a fancy name
for fish stew.

41:05.285 --> 41:06.752
It sounds like a cliché,

41:06.786 --> 41:09.588
but indeed, it's just like
my mother used to make it.

41:14.360 --> 41:17.529
Come on.
You can help me cook.

41:19.599 --> 41:24.836
This is a Chilean dish
that I love,

41:24.871 --> 41:27.873
but I never get to make it.

41:27.907 --> 41:30.209
The kids won't eat it.

41:30.243 --> 41:33.345
But, uh...

41:33.379 --> 41:35.547
you know how that is.

41:36.816 --> 41:38.050
Sure.

41:41.554 --> 41:43.688
Do you mind?

41:43.722 --> 41:47.124
Would you slice the garlic?

41:47.159 --> 41:48.993
Oh.

41:49.027 --> 41:50.594
Very thin.

41:58.937 --> 42:00.938
Why did you invite me here?

42:02.541 --> 42:04.943
We're working together.

42:04.977 --> 42:07.579
Why not break bread together?

42:09.082 --> 42:11.617
Now the garlic.

42:22.025 --> 42:23.358
Mm.

42:26.159 --> 42:27.693
Mmm.

42:29.229 --> 42:31.497
It always amazes me
the way the senses work

42:31.531 --> 42:33.098
in connection to memory.

42:33.132 --> 42:36.801
I mean, this stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

42:36.835 --> 42:38.169
Taken separately,

42:38.203 --> 42:40.303
these ingredients alone
don't remind me of anything.

42:40.338 --> 42:41.638
Hmm.
[chuckling]

42:41.672 --> 42:42.939
Not very much at all.

42:42.973 --> 42:46.709
But, in this
precise combination,

42:46.743 --> 42:49.745
the smell of this meal instantly--

42:49.779 --> 42:52.147
it brings me back to my childhood.

42:52.181 --> 42:53.515
How is that possible?

42:54.850 --> 42:57.118
Basically, it all takes place
in the hippocampus.

42:59.121 --> 43:02.789
Neural connections are formed.

43:02.824 --> 43:07.860
The senses make the neurons
express signals

43:07.894 --> 43:11.230
that go right back to
the same part of the brain

43:11.264 --> 43:13.232
as before,

43:13.266 --> 43:15.668
where memory is stored.

43:15.702 --> 43:21.006
That's, uh, something
called relational memory.

43:22.342 --> 43:24.609
Uh...

43:24.644 --> 43:25.710
don't quote me on that.

43:25.745 --> 43:30.249
I-- I'm rusty on my biology.

43:30.283 --> 43:32.019
That's very interesting.

43:35.462 --> 43:37.834
Walter,

43:37.869 --> 43:39.838
I would like to help you,
if I could.

43:41.841 --> 43:43.942
Help me how?

43:43.976 --> 43:45.243
Well, when I first started out,

43:45.277 --> 43:47.011
I made a lot of mistakes.

43:48.114 --> 43:49.181
[sigh]

43:49.216 --> 43:50.683
More than I care to admit.

43:51.920 --> 43:53.588
I wish I'd had
someone to advise me--

43:53.622 --> 43:54.723
[chuckle]

43:54.757 --> 43:58.262
because this life of ours,

43:58.297 --> 44:00.732
it can overwhelm.

44:05.139 --> 44:07.375
You are a wealthy man now.

44:08.981 --> 44:11.720
And one must learn to be rich.

44:11.754 --> 44:14.561
To be poor anyone can manage.

44:17.801 --> 44:20.537
What advice do you have for me?

44:23.741 --> 44:25.908
Never make
the same mistake twice.

45:08.424 --> 45:09.424
Hey.

45:10.727 --> 45:12.695
What's up?

45:12.729 --> 45:15.430
You, uh, you Tomás?

45:15.464 --> 45:17.363
Heard you were the man.

45:17.397 --> 45:19.429
Yeah? What you want?

45:22.595 --> 45:24.826
Crystal.

45:24.859 --> 45:26.922
You think you could hook me up?

45:28.489 --> 45:29.721
300.

45:29.755 --> 45:30.720
For a teenth?

45:30.754 --> 45:33.085
Shit, come on, yo.

45:33.119 --> 45:34.987
300.

45:37.891 --> 45:39.124
Tch.

45:56.342 --> 45:58.209
Hey, what's up?

46:08.385 --> 46:09.418
Hey.

46:18.597 --> 46:19.764
[whistles]

46:30.376 --> 46:31.777
Bounce.

46:44.626 --> 46:47.428
[breathing heavily]
