00:16.400 --> 00:20.017
-It's strange.
-Hmm....

00:21.528 --> 00:23.935
I remember him being taller.

00:24.155 --> 00:25.648
A trick of the light.

00:25.863 --> 00:29.906
They don't actually get smaller
till they're very, very old.

00:30.866 --> 00:32.775
-I didn't mean the baby.
-I know.

00:32.993 --> 00:35.744
-I meant the Groosalugg.
-I know you did.

00:35.953 --> 00:40.862
He seem-- I don't know, short?

00:41.081 --> 00:42.491
Oh, absolutely.

00:43.332 --> 00:46.581
Clearly, the guy shrank.
All over, probably.

00:46.793 --> 00:49.247
He's nothing but a muscly midget.

00:49.461 --> 00:54.334
Once Cordelia gets him home,
she'll just pop him in a small drawer.

00:54.547 --> 00:57.084
She took him home?

00:57.257 --> 01:03.091
Good. We won't have to put him up.
Place was turning into a hotel.

01:03.302 --> 01:07.298
-You don't have a problem with that?
-Of course not. Why?

01:09.222 --> 01:14.558
Because I don't remember you wearing
perfume when you left this evening.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.975
-There may have been some magic.
-You see?

01:19.186 --> 01:22.636
Actual magic, Lorne.
Whatever happened was a spell.

01:22.855 --> 01:25.641
There's nothing between
Cordelia and me.

01:25.857 --> 01:30.980
Sure there is. It's got arms like
steel cables and ironic timing.

01:31.151 --> 01:34.566
No, it's good the Groosalugg
showed up.

01:34.778 --> 01:38.028
Cordelia deserves a champion.
Now she's got one.

01:38.238 --> 01:40.147
-What about you?
-I'm fine.

01:40.365 --> 01:42.771
I've been solo
most of my 240 years.

01:42.992 --> 01:46.988
When I wasn't, it never went well.
I like being alone.

01:47.203 --> 01:51.530
Fine, Miss Garbo.
Have it your way. Be alone.

02:09.257 --> 02:14.546
-So you got deposed, huh?
-Yes.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.843
-That sucks.
-The people turned against me.

02:19.054 --> 02:22.089
-They'll do that.
-Endless committees formed.

02:22.305 --> 02:26.348
They splintered into factions.
The factions into coalitions.

02:26.558 --> 02:28.634
Coalitions into subcommittees.

02:28.851 --> 02:33.097
Until the radical elements,
spurred by a charismatic leader...

02:33.313 --> 02:36.016
...did the dance of revolution.

02:41.108 --> 02:44.393
-And here you are.
-Yes.

02:46.695 --> 02:50.062
So, you don't miss it?

02:50.780 --> 02:55.856
You know. The power, castle...

02:56.076 --> 02:58.447
...concubines...

02:58.661 --> 03:00.735
...and the royal chippies.

03:04.164 --> 03:06.202
There was never anyone else.

03:08.457 --> 03:11.373
-Oh.
-I welcomed the overthrow.

03:11.584 --> 03:16.125
The tedium of government was hard
to bear after battlefield life.

03:16.671 --> 03:18.911
But your heart wasn't in it.

03:21.006 --> 03:24.539
No. That left when you did.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.566
Princess?

03:55.651 --> 03:57.477
Something wrong?

04:04.490 --> 04:07.774
Couplet

04:59.063 --> 05:00.438
ANGEL:
Hey.

05:01.397 --> 05:05.476
-Morning.
-You the only one here?

05:05.692 --> 05:07.268
So far.

05:08.610 --> 05:11.526
-How's young Connor today?
-He's good.

05:12.529 --> 05:15.197
Cordelia's usually in by now,
isn't she?

05:15.406 --> 05:19.567
I imagine she and Groosalugg
were up late catching up.

05:20.451 --> 05:21.861
Right.

05:22.910 --> 05:24.285
They.

05:24.619 --> 05:28.567
I was hoping we could talk
before the others got here.

05:28.955 --> 05:31.112
Sure. What is it?

05:33.749 --> 05:35.243
Well...

05:38.919 --> 05:40.875
...it's the fact of him.

05:41.420 --> 05:45.831
His sudden arrival was something
we all needed to digest.

05:46.048 --> 05:48.882
-There are questions.
-You're suspicious.

05:49.092 --> 05:52.756
-Cautious might be a better word.
-You think he's evil.

05:53.594 --> 05:56.510
-Evil?
-Okay, maybe not evil.

05:56.721 --> 06:02.424
But he's definitely hiding something.
He seem shorter to you?

06:05.893 --> 06:08.596
We are talking about Connor,
aren't we?

06:09.395 --> 06:12.064
-What about Connor?
-He shouldn't exist.

06:12.271 --> 06:15.556
His birth was foretold.
How many can say that?

06:16.232 --> 06:21.686
He has a role to play, that's true.
We still don't know what that role is.

06:21.902 --> 06:26.229
We can't be afraid to ask the
questions. His enemies won't be.

06:26.613 --> 06:29.566
You' re right. We should be prepared.

06:30.282 --> 06:32.073
I'm glad you agree.

06:32.284 --> 06:36.908
Without the Nyazian prophecies,
we must look elsewhere for answers.

06:37.119 --> 06:41.446
We know where they went.
It's time to assault Wolfram and Hart.

06:41.663 --> 06:45.363
That might not be necessary yet.
There are other sources.

06:45.582 --> 06:48.951
Ancient works accumulate
scholarship, commentary.

06:49.168 --> 06:53.116
-You think somebody has done the work.
-That's my hope.

06:53.337 --> 06:57.499
I've been looking into it.
I felt you should know.

06:57.714 --> 07:01.462
-I want to be involved. Completely.
CORDELlA: lnvolved with who?

07:01.842 --> 07:03.170
You're here...

07:06.053 --> 07:08.424
...and so is he.

07:10.722 --> 07:13.970
Angel, your weapons
are most impressive.

07:15.058 --> 07:17.726
Thanks. Thank you.

07:18.810 --> 07:22.344
Can you ask him
not to handle my weapons?

07:22.896 --> 07:27.769
Relax. If there's one thing Groo
knows, it's how to handle a weapon.

07:27.982 --> 07:31.895
Poor guy. Looks like
that's about all he'll be handling.

07:32.110 --> 07:34.148
You mean, you two didn't...?

07:34.361 --> 07:39.566
I got him home last night,
and we started-- You know.

07:41.699 --> 07:45.149
But then, I couldn't go
through with it.

07:46.326 --> 07:47.784
-You couldn't?
-No.

07:47.993 --> 07:51.112
Not after seeing
that disgusting spiny thing.

07:53.247 --> 07:55.404
-Spiny?
-Right up in my face.

07:55.623 --> 07:58.029
That's what the visions are like.

07:58.249 --> 08:02.162
No pain, less artsy, sometimes floaty,
and often stinky.

08:02.377 --> 08:05.460
-You had a vision?
-Yeah. Big as life.

08:05.670 --> 08:10.911
Last night, while we were getting
reacquainted. Kind of a mood killer.

08:11.132 --> 08:13.966
-You should have called one of us.
-Oh, please.

08:14.176 --> 08:18.253
Like I'd bother you because
I want sex and can't have it.

08:18.469 --> 08:20.342
I meant the vision.

08:21.180 --> 08:26.136
Oh, that. Well, it's not rising up
till sometime later today.

08:26.390 --> 08:32.342
-Oh. Why can't you have sex?
-I could lose my vision-ity.

08:32.561 --> 08:37.351
-lf you want to play it that way.
-Vision-ity. The visions.

08:37.563 --> 08:41.773
When that one hit me last night,
it hit me. In Pylea...

08:41.982 --> 08:46.145
...the visions were to pass
to Groo if we did the com-shuk.

08:46.361 --> 08:49.858
-How do I know that won't happen here?
-You don't.

08:50.071 --> 08:53.273
Your transformation
could have changed that.

08:53.490 --> 08:56.691
Still, you know,
better safe than sorry.

08:58.784 --> 09:02.152
-You're doing the right thing.
-I know. I know.

09:02.369 --> 09:08.157
I can't risk it.
It's just, I'm so....

09:10.375 --> 09:12.331
And he's such a....

09:12.500 --> 09:14.658
[PURRS]

09:15.336 --> 09:16.829
Don't you think?

09:17.337 --> 09:19.163
ANGEL: Yeah, sure.
WESLEY: Certainly.

09:19.380 --> 09:21.870
There's gotta be things we can do...

09:22.089 --> 09:24.959
-...to relieve the tension.
-Jogging.

09:25.425 --> 09:29.123
-Perhaps a paranormal prophylactic.
-Because jogging--

09:29.343 --> 09:34.169
I guess we could probably com
without actually shuking.

09:34.388 --> 09:40.506
That could be a slippery slope that
once you' re on, that you could slide.

09:40.726 --> 09:43.725
At least I won't upset
the average here.

09:43.935 --> 09:47.385
Nobody in this office
is ever gonna get any.

09:53.774 --> 09:55.268
It's funny.

09:56.401 --> 09:58.310
-The way I chew?
-No.

09:58.527 --> 10:02.689
Until that kiss, I thought you
and Wesley had a thing.

10:02.905 --> 10:04.232
-Wesley?
-Yeah.

10:04.447 --> 10:07.067
No, we're just good friends.

10:08.282 --> 10:11.650
-You want another order of those?
-Yes, please.

10:11.868 --> 10:15.816
Oh, no. Wait. No, I'm not hungry.

10:16.037 --> 10:18.527
You sure? I love watching you eat.

10:19.456 --> 10:20.914
Wow.

10:22.208 --> 10:25.789
We should probably go.
People might start to talk.

10:25.959 --> 10:30.750
-Why would they?
-Well, you know, us.

10:30.962 --> 10:34.626
"Us" has been doing breakfast for
weeks now. Everyone knows.

10:34.798 --> 10:40.501
But now that we've kissed, things are
different. I mean, they are, right?

10:41.176 --> 10:42.920
Oh, yeah.

10:49.057 --> 10:51.760
So you don't think they can tell?

10:52.391 --> 10:53.849
From here?

10:54.601 --> 10:57.554
I' m sorry.
I' m being ridiculous, I know.

10:57.769 --> 11:03.888
I don't have much experience with
this. I spent five years in a cave.

11:04.107 --> 11:07.272
-I know what that's like.
-How could you?

11:07.483 --> 11:11.147
Because now, everything's so bright,
my eyes hurt.

11:14.947 --> 11:16.274
WAlTRESS:
Here you go.

11:16.488 --> 11:18.279
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

11:22.284 --> 11:25.901
-How will we work this?
-Like always. We'll split it.

11:26.119 --> 11:30.696
But you hardly ordered anything.
I'd be getting so much more value.

11:31.747 --> 11:34.582
I think I'm making out okay.

-Wesley.

11:43.504 --> 11:47.797
We've identified the demon from
Cordelia's vision as a Senih'D.

11:48.007 --> 11:50.378
It'll rise in the mid-city area...

11:50.591 --> 11:52.500
...sometime before nightfall.

11:55.094 --> 11:59.007
The Senih'D manifests
physically for one purpose.

11:59.221 --> 12:00.549
-Seen it.
WESLEY: T o feed.

12:00.764 --> 12:06.302
Upon rising, it'll search for a victim.
We've got to keep it from finding one.

12:06.518 --> 12:11.012
Angel will take the sewer.
The rest will go to Sorenson Park.

12:11.228 --> 12:14.063
We'll enter the underground,
double back.

12:14.272 --> 12:17.474
-By the time we meet up--
-I know this creature.

12:17.691 --> 12:21.271
It's like the Bleaucha, nested in
the Scum Pits of Ur.

12:21.484 --> 12:23.310
-I have slain many.
-Really?

12:23.527 --> 12:27.227
T racking it will be simple.
Killing it, more difficult.

12:27.446 --> 12:28.727
Well, yeah.

12:29.030 --> 12:33.157
All right, then. Groo, you go
with Angel. Let's move out.

12:38.744 --> 12:41.495
I don't think that's
such a great idea.

12:41.704 --> 12:46.329
Me and him. I'm more of a loner,
really. Plus, he's so, like, bulky.

12:46.541 --> 12:48.449
He could slow me down.

12:48.666 --> 12:52.614
He's an experienced warrior.
He should be a great asset.

12:53.211 --> 12:54.788
Here's a nice one.

The sewers are damp.

Okay.

13:14.181 --> 13:17.265
I'll present this beast's head

13:17.475 --> 13:19.432
Right. She'd love that.

13:36.695 --> 13:40.525
ANGEL: You sense anything?
GROOSALUGG: A deep sadness.

13:44.449 --> 13:48.825
My princess. She is unhappy.
I fear I am the cause.

13:49.535 --> 13:53.531
No, she's not unhappy
you're here, Groo.

13:53.913 --> 13:56.663
She's thrilled.

13:57.457 --> 13:59.993
Then what keeps her from me?

14:00.250 --> 14:04.495
There is a distance,
as if her heart is not free.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.287
ANGEL: I think maybe she's afraid
to get too close.

14:09.838 --> 14:14.297
She's scared if she does,
she'll lose something.

You think your place is secure

No, strike that.

Why else would Jerry cheat on me?
We've been engaged eight years.

16:55.517 --> 16:58.801
She had to have put
some kind of a spell on him.

16:59.019 --> 17:03.680

Greek, if possible. Certainly.

17:15.779 --> 17:19.560

-Vampire.
-Yeah. Did I mention that?

34:44.925 --> 34:46.382
TREE MONSTER:
Cold.

34:46.592 --> 34:50.043
ANGEL: It's cold in there.
But don't let that stop you.

35:01.768 --> 35:04.887
-So cold.
GUNN: So dead!

35:09.398 --> 35:10.429
[ANGEL GASPS]

35:17.486 --> 35:18.813
How is he?

35:19.028 --> 35:24.316
Pretty beat up, but still alive.
Thanks to you.

35:31.410 --> 35:33.449
WESLEY:
Yes, Ms. Frakes, we are too.

35:35.537 --> 35:37.281
You're welcome.

35:37.497 --> 35:38.872
Goodbye.

35:40.374 --> 35:44.121
Ms. Frakes is very happy.
He saved her fiancé's life.

35:44.542 --> 35:46.286
-So he'll be okay?
WESLEY: Yes.

35:46.503 --> 35:48.293
-That's good.
-Yes.

35:52.923 --> 35:56.337
Good work.
You should probably get cleaned up.

35:56.550 --> 35:59.798
-Yeah, good idea.
-Charles, a word?

36:07.598 --> 36:09.008
FRED: Good night.
-Good night.

36:12.309 --> 36:13.684
What is it?

36:17.354 --> 36:20.768
When it became more than a tryst,
you should've told me.

36:20.939 --> 36:23.973
It happened fast.
It grabbed the guy and he was gone.

36:25.358 --> 36:28.892
That's not what I meant.

36:30.236 --> 36:33.603
Oh. You mean...?

36:38.116 --> 36:41.233
I'm not so sure
that's any of your business.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.323
No, you're probably right.

36:47.496 --> 36:48.870
Still...

36:49.789 --> 36:51.331
...she could get hurt.

36:55.416 --> 36:58.251
-I trust that won't happen.
-What are you, her brother?

36:59.711 --> 37:01.619
Apparently.

37:05.798 --> 37:07.624
-Wesley, l--
-She chose.

37:11.010 --> 37:14.591
It's just important to me
that she's taken care of.

37:16.220 --> 37:18.094
She will be.

37:18.639 --> 37:20.049
Good.

37:42.569 --> 37:44.062
CORDELlA:
Sorry.

37:44.820 --> 37:48.235
It's okay. It was already ruined.

37:48.448 --> 37:52.064
I planned to rip it off him later,
anyway.

37:52.283 --> 37:56.030
-You did get the potion?
-Yeah. We got it.

37:57.078 --> 38:01.369
Well, this isn't so bad.
You heal almost as fast as he does.

38:02.664 --> 38:06.909
-Princess, I have a confession to make.
-Groo.

38:07.125 --> 38:11.252
What confession?
Did something happen at the brothel?

38:11.961 --> 38:14.712
You were supposed to look after him.

38:14.921 --> 38:19.131
Nothing happened.
Except your boyfriend here was...

38:19.341 --> 38:23.003
...very brave and saved the day.

38:25.552 --> 38:27.840
You did? You big hero!

38:28.054 --> 38:32.180
No. I was reckless.
I put everyone in grave peril.

38:35.808 --> 38:37.847
Angel is the true champion.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.724
-He saved us.
-Did you hear that?

38:43.771 --> 38:45.099
Yeah, but--

38:45.313 --> 38:49.180
How many guys would
give away the credit like that?

38:51.150 --> 38:53.605
That is just so noble. The potion.

38:55.653 --> 38:57.313
Let's get out of here.

38:57.654 --> 38:58.982
See you.

39:00.697 --> 39:02.108
Cordelia.

39:02.324 --> 39:03.603
What?

39:13.538 --> 39:15.115
What is it?

39:21.043 --> 39:23.912
-What's this?
-Just some money I saved up.

39:24.128 --> 39:25.408
Why? What for?

39:26.671 --> 39:30.832
I did something for you tonight. Now
I want you to do something for me.

39:33.633 --> 39:37.676
Don't come in tomorrow.
Don't come in for a couple of weeks.

39:38.261 --> 39:43.715
T ake Groo someplace nice.
Someplace where there's sun.

39:45.348 --> 39:46.926
You'd like that.

39:48.433 --> 39:51.183
-Angel--
-Promise me.

39:54.770 --> 39:56.145
Okay.

40:04.401 --> 40:07.152
You sure you don't need
some patching up?

40:08.653 --> 40:11.190
I'm good. Didn't hurt a bit.

40:38.379 --> 40:42.244
HOST: All right, now.
You get some rest, big boy.

40:42.464 --> 40:47.836
Yes. You go to sleep.
Get you nice and tucked in.

40:48.342 --> 40:49.718
Yes.

40:51.511 --> 40:56.717
-Thanks for looking after him.
-Yeah, sure. You okay?

41:00.350 --> 41:01.724
Yeah.

41:34.786 --> 41:37.490
-Working late?
-Yes.

41:38.956 --> 41:41.825
-You startled me.
-Oh, we didn't mean to.

41:43.500 --> 41:47.709
-I thought I was alone.
-Yeah. So did l.
