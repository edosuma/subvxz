[storyteller] <i>The housekeeper</i>

01:24.041 --> 01:27.458

01:41.958 --> 01:43.083
The door got stuck.

01:47.041 --> 01:49.125
It was stuck,
and we couldn't get it open.

01:49.958 --> 01:50.791
Honest.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.500
And the mess in the hall?

01:55.250 --> 01:56.416
It's just a bit of mud.

01:58.625 --> 01:59.458
[Dani] Hm.

02:00.791 --> 02:01.833
Well, I forgive you.

02:03.750 --> 02:04.875
But I'm afraid I…

02:06.166 --> 02:07.333
I don't believe you.

02:09.958 --> 02:11.000
That's the issue.

[Flora grunts]

02:26.458 --> 02:27.291
[Dani] Miles!

02:28.916 --> 02:31.875
[Hannah exclaims]
Miles, I just mopped that bit!

02:32.458 --> 02:33.958
[Miles breathing heavily]

02:35.666 --> 02:36.666
[chute bangs shut]

02:37.458 --> 02:38.791
[Dani] Can I have that, please?

02:48.833 --> 02:50.333
-What are you--
-[Dani] Not me.

02:51.458 --> 02:52.291
You.

02:52.958 --> 02:56.541
That was entirely unacceptable,
and now you are going to finish mopping.

02:56.958 --> 02:58.750
-But that's not fair!
-[Dani] Hey.

02:58.833 --> 03:00.166
It's just a bit of mud.

03:03.291 --> 03:04.208
[Miles sighs]

03:05.250 --> 03:06.666
Now, you'll finish mopping

03:07.166 --> 03:09.125
while Flora and I go get her doll back.

03:10.333 --> 03:11.666
A-Assuming…

03:11.750 --> 03:12.708
[inhales deeply]

03:12.791 --> 03:14.833
…that's all right with you, Mrs. Grose?

03:14.916 --> 03:17.541
Oh, n-no, it's-- fine by me.

03:18.083 --> 03:20.333
In fact,
we've had this conversation before,

03:20.416 --> 03:21.833
haven't we, Miles? Hm?

03:21.916 --> 03:24.916
Every few weeks, it feels like these two
are off on a midnight run,

03:25.000 --> 03:27.208
and muggins here
is left to mop up their mud.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.041
[cheerful whistling]

03:37.875 --> 03:39.208
[Owen] Good morning.

03:39.291 --> 03:40.583
[Dani] Excuse us, Owen.

03:43.458 --> 03:45.333
-Hi, Owen.
-Flora.

03:45.416 --> 03:46.750
Come on.

03:46.833 --> 03:48.250
I don't like the cellar.

03:48.958 --> 03:50.791
It's perfectly dreadful down there.

03:51.833 --> 03:54.958
Can I stay and have a glass
of orange juice with Owen, please?

03:55.041 --> 03:57.916
-[Dani chuckles]
-[Flora] I'm sorry, I'm not being cheeky.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.375
It's just… I quite hate the cellar.

04:00.875 --> 04:02.458
It's perfectly dreadful.

04:03.208 --> 04:05.375
[Dani chuckles] Is that all right?

04:05.875 --> 04:07.041
I'll just be a sec.

04:07.583 --> 04:10.791
Somebody's brother threw their doll
down the laundry chute.

04:10.875 --> 04:12.875
Oh… of course.

04:12.958 --> 04:14.166
Thank you.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.291
[Owen] Hmm.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.333
[switch clicks]

04:22.666 --> 04:23.500
[clicking]

04:27.083 --> 04:30.708
Brothers can be
perfectly dreadful sometimes, can't they?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.041
He isn't, though.

04:34.750 --> 04:35.958
He really isn't.

04:38.458 --> 04:40.583
You have a fine heart, miss.

04:47.541 --> 04:49.083
[light fitting creaking]

05:31.166 --> 05:32.125
[Dani] <i>Look who I found.</i>

05:34.208 --> 05:35.208
What's her name?

05:36.083 --> 05:37.333
She can't remember.

05:42.708 --> 05:44.458
Are you gonna hang it in your room?

05:45.208 --> 05:46.083
For protection?

05:46.583 --> 05:48.083
No, I took it down.

05:48.666 --> 05:51.166
-[Dani] Why?
-[Flora] Because it doesn't work.

05:54.875 --> 05:55.791
[Dani] Miles?

05:56.208 --> 05:57.041
Miles?

05:58.958 --> 06:00.125
You can go get dressed.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.583
[creaking sound]

06:31.708 --> 06:32.541
Miles?

06:37.458 --> 06:38.291
Miles?

06:41.750 --> 06:43.291
[echoing] Miles, are you okay?

06:55.416 --> 06:56.333
[man] All right, boys.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.333
Let's settle down.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.708
Let's find our seats, shall we?

07:01.083 --> 07:01.958
[student] Hello.

07:03.708 --> 07:04.541
Welcome.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.416
Good morning, gentlemen.

07:06.583 --> 07:08.875
[students] Good morning, Father Stack.

07:09.500 --> 07:13.333
[sighs] I trust you all had
a very festive Christmas.

07:13.416 --> 07:15.791
-[students] Yes.
-[Father Stack] Excellent.

07:16.333 --> 07:17.708
I think we have a majority.

07:18.583 --> 07:19.750
Well, then…

07:19.833 --> 07:21.416
spring term.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.958
Congratulations. Seems like you've made it
through the winter,

07:24.041 --> 07:26.083
though not without a few casualties.

07:26.166 --> 07:28.750
I'm afraid Brian Duncan
won't be joining us for a bit.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.541
-Yes?
-Is he ill?

07:30.625 --> 07:32.791
No, Mr. Hooper. Nothing quite so serious.

07:32.875 --> 07:34.291
He took a bit of a tumble.

07:34.375 --> 07:37.416
He is on the mend
and will be back with us shortly.

07:37.833 --> 07:38.666
So…

07:38.750 --> 07:40.000
shall we begin?

07:40.708 --> 07:41.541
Bibles.

07:43.916 --> 07:47.708
"Now, there on the hillside,
a great herd of swine was feeding."

07:47.791 --> 07:50.416
"And the unclean spirits begged him,

07:50.500 --> 07:52.250
'Send us into the swine.'

07:52.958 --> 07:54.208
'Let us enter them.'"

07:54.291 --> 07:57.125
"So, he gave them permission."

07:57.708 --> 08:00.958
"And the unclean spirits came out
and entered the swine."

08:01.458 --> 08:04.333
"And the herd rushed down the deep slope

08:04.416 --> 08:07.166
into the lake and were drowned there."

08:08.166 --> 08:09.000
So…

08:10.208 --> 08:11.125
…there we have it.

08:12.333 --> 08:13.166
Three Gospels,

08:13.666 --> 08:16.916
three slightly different accounts
of the same event.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.500
Three different places
that it could have happened.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.666
But the broad strokes remain the same.

08:22.416 --> 08:26.416
Jesus cast the demons,
known as "Legion" in Luke and Mark,

08:26.500 --> 08:27.916
unnamed in Matthew,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.500
out of a single man,
according to Luke and Mark,

08:30.583 --> 08:32.583
two men according to Matthew, into…

08:32.666 --> 08:34.958
and on this they all agree,

08:35.500 --> 08:38.125
-a herd of pigs.
-[boy 1] That then go jump in the lake.

08:38.666 --> 08:41.041
That then go jump in the lake, exactly.

08:41.541 --> 08:44.375
[boy 2] Um, but why was Matthew
being so contrarian?

08:44.458 --> 08:47.291
-[boy 3] What's contrarian?
-It means he was being a tit.

08:47.375 --> 08:50.875
-[students giggling]
-Hey, language, Obermann. Final warning.

08:50.958 --> 08:53.000
Miller, excellent question.

08:54.166 --> 08:55.916
Why do the Gospel accounts differ?

08:56.625 --> 08:57.458
Well…

08:59.125 --> 09:00.541
because man is fallible.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.291
Even the men who wrote these Gospels.

09:04.500 --> 09:08.166
Even me, which I'll have to remind
some of your parents, no doubt,

09:08.250 --> 09:09.958
once they get wind of this conversation.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.500
They needed permission?

09:11.625 --> 09:12.541
The demons?

09:12.625 --> 09:14.750
-Permission to…
-[Miles] To enter the pigs.

09:15.375 --> 09:17.083
Ah! Yes, they did.

09:19.083 --> 09:20.791
Did they need it for him, though?

09:21.666 --> 09:23.250
Did they need it for the man?

09:25.500 --> 09:28.041
Ah… Excellent question, Wingrave.

09:28.958 --> 09:31.166
And that, actually,
is the… the big takeaway here,

09:31.250 --> 09:32.708
so thank you for asking that.

09:33.208 --> 09:36.541
We are, all of us,
free to make our own choices.

09:37.125 --> 09:40.291
It's one of the most important gifts
that God has given us.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.208
A gift that not even the demons
in this story could usurp.

09:46.333 --> 09:48.166
See, evil exists,

09:48.916 --> 09:50.250
and we are tempted.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.291
But we are not compelled.

09:53.708 --> 09:54.541
So, yes.

09:55.916 --> 09:57.166
They did need his permission.

09:57.250 --> 09:59.333
[school bell rings]

10:00.250 --> 10:01.583
As they need ours!

10:02.333 --> 10:03.416
All right, gentlemen.

10:03.500 --> 10:04.500
Wingrave.

10:04.625 --> 10:05.958
Uh, quick word.

10:12.375 --> 10:14.875
The headmaster passed this onto me
this morning.

10:15.375 --> 10:20.041
It's not often that a-- a student
gets any post on the first day.

10:20.416 --> 10:22.250
And judging by the writing
on the envelope,

10:22.333 --> 10:23.958
-I assume it's from--
-My sister.

10:24.458 --> 10:27.125
Very thoughtful of her
to have it waiting for you.

10:27.750 --> 10:30.625
Something to make you feel
a bit more at home, no doubt.

10:31.916 --> 10:35.375
You asked some excellent questions today,
by the way.

10:35.916 --> 10:36.833
Thank you, sir.

10:37.375 --> 10:38.750
You are most welcome.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.541
And, Wingrave…

10:40.625 --> 10:44.666
I want you to know that this room
is a-- a safe place for questions.

10:45.083 --> 10:46.333
Not just about your studies.

10:47.166 --> 10:48.416
About anything you like.

10:49.041 --> 10:51.916
I am here,
as are the other members of the staff,

10:52.000 --> 10:54.208
so if you feel the need to talk,

10:54.833 --> 10:55.666
we'll listen.

10:56.833 --> 10:59.208
You're in none of this alone,
is what I'm driving at.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.208
Thank you, sir.

11:00.958 --> 11:02.833
Well, I won't keep you.

on more than one occasion.

Do what?

Why'd you jump?

What was that?

I didn't jump.

I fell.

-Loosen your tie. There you go.

15:40.625 --> 15:42.541
Okay, everybody back to class, now.

15:42.625 --> 15:43.583
Go on, all of you.

15:45.333 --> 15:48.166
-[bird coos]
-[Father Stack] So, you started it?

15:49.250 --> 15:50.833
Had he wronged you in some way?

15:52.333 --> 15:53.500
Said something to you?

15:54.000 --> 15:55.291
Something to set you off?

15:57.958 --> 15:59.875
Look, Miles…

16:00.375 --> 16:03.166
I wanna help you,
but I need you to help me,

16:03.250 --> 16:04.333
to understand this.

16:04.791 --> 16:07.083
And not only me, Hooper's parents.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.458
They could push for a suspension.

16:09.958 --> 16:12.916
And the headmaster
will want to mollify them. But…

16:14.041 --> 16:15.625
…I put myself ahead of that.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.916
The headmaster and I have already spoken…

16:19.250 --> 16:20.583
…and I have made it clear

16:20.666 --> 16:25.166
that your well-being is my responsibility,
and priority…

16:26.000 --> 16:26.875
moving forward.

16:28.916 --> 16:29.833
But, Wingrave…

16:31.000 --> 16:32.125
…this isn't the way.

16:35.041 --> 16:37.250
Look, I understand
what you're going through.

16:37.791 --> 16:39.916
Or, you know what? Maybe I don't.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.583
Maybe I don't, so…

16:42.416 --> 16:43.458
So, tell me.

16:44.625 --> 16:45.666
Be <i>my </i>teacher.

16:46.333 --> 16:47.166
Hm?

16:48.416 --> 16:50.541
We all do terrible things sometimes.

16:51.416 --> 16:54.500
That's expected.
It's-- it's baked into us from the start.

16:56.083 --> 17:01.666
But it's that feeling of remorse,
that guilt, that terrible guilt,

17:02.166 --> 17:03.833
burning inside your chest, that's…

17:04.333 --> 17:07.208
that's what distinguishes us
in God's eyes.

17:09.250 --> 17:10.500
None of us are blameless.

17:11.541 --> 17:15.916
Except the soul that's not yet conceived
and the animals.

17:17.750 --> 17:18.875
Like Pidge over there.

17:21.250 --> 17:22.625
They're the only innocents.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.208
Then it wasn't fair, was it?

17:27.250 --> 17:28.083
What wasn't?

17:28.916 --> 17:30.791
What Jesus did to the pigs.

17:31.416 --> 17:32.583
In the demon story.

17:33.958 --> 17:34.791
Maybe not.

17:35.583 --> 17:39.750
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
A cliché, I know, but…

17:41.125 --> 17:41.958
…true.

17:42.708 --> 17:45.416
And death is something to mourn,

17:45.916 --> 17:46.750
not fear.

17:47.791 --> 17:49.500
And you've had to deal with death…

17:50.500 --> 17:52.750
…far, far more
than a child your age should.

17:53.958 --> 17:54.791
Far more.

17:57.708 --> 17:58.666
[sighs]

17:59.833 --> 18:01.500
They're in a better place, Miles.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.583
I don't know everything, but…

18:05.625 --> 18:06.750
I do know that much.

18:07.750 --> 18:09.083
They're in a better place.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.125
They're not coming back.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.250
I'm afraid not.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.291
That's not fair either.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.791
No, it isn't.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.500
Why do the bad ones get to come back,

18:31.291 --> 18:32.125
and not them?

18:41.958 --> 18:43.666

[music intensifying]

20:08.291 --> 20:09.958
[man, sternly] Master Wingrave…

20:10.750 --> 20:12.750
is there anything you'd like to say?

20:14.000 --> 20:14.875
Anything at all?

20:18.041 --> 20:21.166
I have a mind to expel you, young man.
I truly have.

20:21.833 --> 20:23.291
But Father Stack…

20:24.291 --> 20:26.000
Well, Father, I'll let you say it.

20:27.708 --> 20:28.708
[Father Stack sighs]

20:29.083 --> 20:30.041
Wingrave…

20:30.708 --> 20:31.583
Miles.

20:32.625 --> 20:35.583
What you've done,
it… it can't be minimized, it…

20:36.208 --> 20:39.916
can't be avoided by not talking about it
or by you being sent home.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.083
It follows you.

20:43.541 --> 20:44.666
Do you understand? It…

20:45.083 --> 20:45.916
It stays.

20:47.166 --> 20:48.208
But remorse,

20:48.708 --> 20:50.333
or demonstrating remorse,

20:50.416 --> 20:52.000
won't make all of this go away,

20:52.083 --> 20:54.541
I'm not gonna lie to you,
but it is the first step

20:54.625 --> 20:57.458
towards some kind of absolution.

20:58.041 --> 21:00.083
Hm… Towards grace.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.083
Look, I-I know
that you have been through a lot.

21:03.166 --> 21:04.416
Do not feel sorry for me.

21:04.833 --> 21:07.458
Your parents… and your au pair.

21:07.541 --> 21:10.250
-More than we could hope to understand.
-Don't.

21:10.333 --> 21:13.166
And the weight of all that
could cause one, anyone,

21:13.250 --> 21:15.791
to do terrible things,
even if they didn't mean to.

21:16.291 --> 21:17.250
It could press one,

21:17.333 --> 21:20.875
-drive one to commit acts that--
-We are not compelled.

21:21.375 --> 21:22.958
What our chaplain is saying

21:23.041 --> 21:26.916
is that we're going to start
with an apology and go from there.

21:27.625 --> 21:30.833
He is correct
about your special circumstances…

21:32.083 --> 21:35.458
…but I at least have to insist
on the apology.

21:36.041 --> 21:38.291
For God's sake,
we at least have to have that.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.166
[raises voice] Speak!

21:44.750 --> 21:48.083
That animal is dead
because of you, Wingrave.

21:50.166 --> 21:51.375
Dead doesn't mean gone.

21:52.166 --> 21:53.541
[headmaster] What did you say?

21:55.750 --> 21:56.583
I'm sorry.

21:57.125 --> 21:58.333
I know you are, Miles.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.833
I know that, and I also know that…

22:01.333 --> 22:03.916
-together, you and I--
-I'm sorry I didn't do worse.

22:05.083 --> 22:09.375
Cut off its head, spread out the insides,
or burn it.

22:10.791 --> 22:12.333
I'm sorry I didn't do worse.

22:14.208 --> 22:16.000
-[headmaster] Ahem.
-[Father Stack sighs]

22:16.083 --> 22:17.333
[headmaster] Right, then.

22:18.833 --> 22:21.500
Get Master Wingrave's uncle
on the telephone, please.

22:33.250 --> 22:34.583
[Miles] I'm sorry, Father.

22:35.791 --> 22:36.625
I…

22:40.000 --> 22:41.500
I needed to find your key.

22:43.416 --> 22:44.250
That's all.

[storyteller]
<i>And so the reason for Miles's expulsion</i>

22:52.541 --> 22:54.083
<i>was difficult to pin down.</i>

22:54.541 --> 22:57.208
<i>He was expelled, it turned out,</i>
<i>for an injury,</i>

22:58.041 --> 23:00.333
<i>an accident, a crime,</i>

23:01.250 --> 23:02.125

<i>no one would understand.</i>

<i>delivered when he arrived,</i>
<i>forgotten in the dormitory,</i>

23:17.791 --> 23:19.500

23:20.291 --> 23:24.625

<i>to be sent home.</i>

[whispering] "Come home."

23:50.666 --> 23:51.583
[sighs]

23:54.333 --> 23:55.416
I'm finished.

23:56.125 --> 23:58.000
Okay, I'll be with you in just a sec.

23:59.375 --> 24:02.125
-Are they gonna go back in their house?
-[Flora] Later.

24:03.750 --> 24:04.625
Okay.

24:24.708 --> 24:26.250
Spick and span!

24:26.708 --> 24:29.208
-I imagine you learned that at--
-Boarding school.

24:29.708 --> 24:32.083
Yeah. Professional, I'd say.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.916
[chuckles] Why don't you come
teach your sister how to do it?

24:36.375 --> 24:37.708
She'll think it's just splendid.

24:38.291 --> 24:40.666
-Oh-- But--
-Just splendid.

24:41.166 --> 24:44.125
[footsteps receding]

[cup clatters]

24:55.833 --> 24:57.000
What are you up to?

24:57.083 --> 24:59.166
Hannah's got the day off, it seems.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.375
Mm. The new missus put the children to it.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.291
Yeah.

25:04.250 --> 25:05.083
For real?

25:05.583 --> 25:06.833
-[Miles] Mm.
-[Hannah] Mm-hmm.

25:07.416 --> 25:08.250
[Dani chuckles]

25:08.333 --> 25:09.166
Nice.

25:10.125 --> 25:11.250
How are they doing?

25:12.041 --> 25:14.208
Perfectly. [chuckles]

25:14.708 --> 25:15.958
I could get used to this.

25:16.041 --> 25:20.416
[Hannah] Oh, I don't know, I feel lazy.
Like some sort of lazy layabout.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.958
Go on, admit it.

25:22.041 --> 25:24.708
-You're loving having this wee break.
-Oh, I suppose.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.750
I just don't like seeing them punished,
is all.

25:28.250 --> 25:31.500
They're not the first to track mud
through the halls. You should know.

25:31.583 --> 25:33.500
Every time I see you
marching towards the house,

25:33.583 --> 25:35.583
I find my hand drifting towards the mop.

25:37.041 --> 25:37.875
Firstly…

25:38.541 --> 25:41.416
I always wipe my feet, I'll have you know.
And, secondly…

25:42.250 --> 25:43.958
what about when
they locked her in a closet?

25:44.041 --> 25:46.041
Oh, now, you can't blame them for that.

25:46.541 --> 25:48.916
Given what they've lost,
strangeness is expected.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.958
You can't give them a pass forever.

25:51.458 --> 25:54.666
Look, you clean up after them,
Owen feeds them, Rebecca…

25:57.041 --> 25:58.166
Rebecca coddled them.

25:59.375 --> 26:00.250
But this one…

26:00.916 --> 26:03.375
-This one's got them doing hard labor.
-Oh, come on, now.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.791
[Jamie laughing] What?
That shite works.

26:05.916 --> 26:07.208
Well, it worked on me.

26:07.541 --> 26:09.875
Look at me now.
I'm a shining beacon of reform.

26:09.958 --> 26:10.875
[both laugh]

26:10.958 --> 26:13.250
[Jamie] Ah, thank God. You're a star.

-Cheers.
-Hannah?

26:15.625 --> 26:16.458
[Hannah] Hm?

26:16.541 --> 26:17.875
-G and T?
-Oh, no.

26:17.958 --> 26:21.750
No, thank you. Not for me.

-Hm?

Thoughts on the new au pair.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.000
-Gossip.
-What?

26:29.083 --> 26:31.916
It's just Christian concern, Hannah.
All right, fine.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.750
On a scale of zero to American,

26:33.833 --> 26:35.000
how would you rate her?

26:35.708 --> 26:37.958
-[Hannah and Owen] American.
-[all laugh]

26:39.416 --> 26:40.666
[Jamie] There we have it.

26:41.250 --> 26:43.041
Though, maybe a bit too pretty.

26:43.458 --> 26:45.458
Do you think she's pretty, Owen?

26:45.583 --> 26:46.416
Jamie!

-[Jamie laughs]
-Uh…

26:47.875 --> 26:48.916
[Jamie] Look at him!

26:49.000 --> 26:50.333
He's tongue-tied.

26:50.416 --> 26:52.333
-He can't answer.
-[Owen clears throat]

26:52.416 --> 26:55.250
It's just romances don't fare well at Bly,
do they?

26:55.333 --> 26:57.333
-[Jamie] We're just having a laugh.
-[Hannah] I know.

26:57.416 --> 26:58.958
But then that's how it starts.

27:00.208 --> 27:02.500
Don't worry.
I only have eyes for you, Hannah.

27:03.125 --> 27:04.958
-Oh.
-Enjoy your break, ladies.

27:08.625 --> 27:09.750
Oh, I almost forgot.

27:09.833 --> 27:12.166
Um, in the kitchen,
there's a crack in the ceiling.

27:12.250 --> 27:13.916
Would you mind popping in
to have a look?

27:14.416 --> 27:15.333
Where exactly?

27:15.416 --> 27:17.416
Uh, by the stove,
high up towards the ceiling.

27:17.500 --> 27:18.500
You can't miss it.

27:19.125 --> 27:20.250
I'll get round to it.

27:21.291 --> 27:22.958
Great work, you lot! Keep it up!

27:27.041 --> 27:28.208
[footsteps approaching]

27:28.291 --> 27:29.875
[door creaks]

27:31.416 --> 27:33.583
[Dani] Flora, you cleaned!

27:33.666 --> 27:34.958
Well, how sweet of you.

27:35.916 --> 27:36.750
You're welcome.

27:37.291 --> 27:40.583
I put all your things into the wardrobe
and chest of drawers.

27:44.541 --> 27:46.333
[suspenseful music plays]

27:48.166 --> 27:49.291
Are you cross with me?

27:58.625 --> 28:00.166
I-I found these, too.

28:00.791 --> 28:02.791
I didn't break them. I promise.

28:04.041 --> 28:06.083
-They were like this already.
-It's fine.

28:06.958 --> 28:07.833
It's fine.

28:07.916 --> 28:09.583
[gasping softly]

28:19.958 --> 28:20.958
Excuse me a minute.

28:37.208 --> 28:40.208
[panicked breathing]

28:41.458 --> 28:43.458
[gasping, sobbing]

28:44.500 --> 28:45.375
You all right?

28:53.458 --> 28:54.541
Kids.

28:54.625 --> 28:55.791
Run you ragged.

28:56.833 --> 28:57.666
[Dani] Yeah.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.125
[Jamie] Well, people really.

29:01.583 --> 29:02.708
-All of them.
-Mm-hmm.

29:02.791 --> 29:04.166
That's why I prefer plants.

29:04.916 --> 29:06.125
Easy to get along with.

29:07.625 --> 29:09.208
And I find if I don't like one,

29:09.291 --> 29:11.083
one looks at me kind of funny,

29:11.166 --> 29:12.291
I can always just…

29:12.958 --> 29:13.791
you know…

29:14.958 --> 29:16.208
[makes choking sound]

29:17.000 --> 29:17.833
[Dani sniffles]

29:18.333 --> 29:20.750
So, if it's child-rearing advice
you're after, I'd just…

29:20.833 --> 29:22.000
[Dani laughs]

29:22.500 --> 29:23.625
…start there, maybe.

29:25.083 --> 29:25.916
There we are.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.333
It's not so bad, right?

29:29.875 --> 29:30.708
Yeah.

29:31.250 --> 29:34.625
I cry three, maybe four times a day
around here.

29:35.666 --> 29:37.541
Five, if I'm really being honest
with myself.

29:38.125 --> 29:40.958
How else do you think
I keep all these fucking plants watered?

29:41.041 --> 29:44.750
With my endless well of deep,
inconsolable tears.

29:45.083 --> 29:45.916
That's how.

29:46.833 --> 29:48.708
It's what got me the job
in the first place.

29:50.625 --> 29:51.750
Look, you're doing great.

29:55.833 --> 29:56.791
You're doing great.

29:57.916 --> 29:58.916
Thank you.

29:59.708 --> 30:00.541
Anytime.

30:01.083 --> 30:01.958
[Dani sighs]

30:02.791 --> 30:04.000
Right. [clears throat]

30:04.083 --> 30:05.250
Well, back to it, then.

30:05.833 --> 30:07.083
Chin up, Poppins.

30:12.708 --> 30:13.541
[door opens]

30:14.958 --> 30:15.875
[door closes]

30:31.541 --> 30:33.541
[footsteps approaching]

30:34.666 --> 30:36.250
Uh, where are you off to?

30:37.958 --> 30:40.916
Heading back to the garden.
I have a few more weeds to pull.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.958
Trying to earn time off
for good behavior, then?

30:44.375 --> 30:46.500
Have a lovely afternoon, Jamie darling.

30:51.125 --> 30:51.958
"Darling?"

30:55.333 --> 30:56.208
[sighs]

30:56.875 --> 30:58.208
[water running]

31:06.208 --> 31:07.541
[echoing bang]

31:07.625 --> 31:08.750
[cabinet door squeaks]

31:09.416 --> 31:10.625
[water turns off]

31:14.583 --> 31:16.583
[exhales heavily]

31:17.666 --> 31:18.666
[clears throat]

31:25.500 --> 31:27.416
[birds chirping, insects chittering]

31:27.500 --> 31:30.666
No, no, no, no, not too much,
or they'll come to take you away.

31:30.750 --> 31:31.791
Who will?

31:31.875 --> 31:33.041
The food police.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.458
For a salt and buttery.

31:34.541 --> 31:35.541
[Flora giggles]

31:36.041 --> 31:37.333
Oh, my God.

31:37.416 --> 31:40.083
You're such a lovely man, Owen.
Why must you speak?

31:40.166 --> 31:41.750
-[Dani laughs]
-[Miles] Miss Clayton?

31:42.916 --> 31:44.041
Might I have a word?

31:44.708 --> 31:46.041
Yeah, sure thing.

31:46.541 --> 31:47.833
In private.

31:52.041 --> 31:54.166
[phone ringing]

31:54.250 --> 31:56.583
-[Owen] We've got this, right?
-Right.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.125
Wingrave residence.

32:01.833 --> 32:03.541
[Flora in distance] Hello? Hello?

32:10.166 --> 32:11.000
Hello?

32:19.375 --> 32:20.208
So?

32:20.708 --> 32:21.958
I'd like to apologize.

32:23.666 --> 32:24.583
For all of it.

32:24.666 --> 32:27.875
For locking you in the wardrobe closet,
for the mess in the hall.

32:28.375 --> 32:29.458
All of it.

32:29.541 --> 32:32.041
But, most importantly,
for being such a child about it.

32:32.625 --> 32:34.958
Being around Flora,
I sometimes forget myself.

32:40.708 --> 32:41.541
Wow.

32:42.041 --> 32:43.125
That's, um…

32:49.708 --> 32:52.250
I think
Flora just misses Miss Jessel terribly.

32:52.750 --> 32:55.250
So, we play little games
to keep her from feeling sad.

32:55.333 --> 32:56.166
Mm.

32:56.750 --> 32:58.083
Such a draining thing.

32:59.708 --> 33:00.958
Dealing with children.

33:04.875 --> 33:07.833
[Miles whistling]

33:16.541 --> 33:17.458
Little shit.

33:17.916 --> 33:18.750
Hey.

33:19.750 --> 33:21.375
Little fucking shit.

33:21.458 --> 33:22.708
Hey, he's just a kid.

33:23.208 --> 33:24.250
I'm gonna kill him.

33:24.333 --> 33:27.041
-I swear to God--
-No. Hey, they're just a few flowers.

33:27.125 --> 33:29.291
Oh! Sure. Well, that's fine, then.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.958
A little boy cut a few flowers.

33:31.041 --> 33:33.708
-What's the big deal?
-They weren't ready to be cut!

33:37.333 --> 33:38.166
[Jamie sighs]

33:39.125 --> 33:40.041
Look, I just…

33:40.916 --> 33:42.916
I have a way of doing things,
and I don't like people

33:43.000 --> 33:45.541
-messing about in my garden.
-No, you're right.

33:46.333 --> 33:47.166
You're right.

33:49.916 --> 33:50.875
I'll talk to him.

33:52.875 --> 33:54.333
[sighs] 'Course.

33:57.541 --> 33:59.875
[sighs] Look, could we just go back
to the bit

33:59.958 --> 34:01.583
where, uh, you were acting mental

34:01.666 --> 34:03.625
-and I had to talk <i>you </i>down?
-[Dani laughs]

34:03.708 --> 34:06.000
[crickets chirping]

34:10.833 --> 34:12.250
Ten minutes, okay?

34:12.333 --> 34:15.625
I wanna see teeth brushed,
hands washed, and pajamas on!

34:16.375 --> 34:17.416
Good day?

34:17.500 --> 34:18.833
-Great day.
-Aw.

34:18.916 --> 34:20.333
-[Dani] Now…
-Mm.

34:20.416 --> 34:23.541
I've got a little surprise set up
for the kiddos,

34:23.625 --> 34:24.875
if you wanna join.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.375
Oh… Oh, uh…

34:28.000 --> 34:29.333
No, I couldn't.

34:29.416 --> 34:30.791
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, fine.

34:30.875 --> 34:32.875
I just, well…
I haven't been sleeping very well.

34:32.958 --> 34:34.708
I think I'll turn in for the night.

34:34.791 --> 34:36.166
-Okay.
-Good night, darling.

34:36.250 --> 34:37.458
-Good night.
-Good night.

34:38.916 --> 34:40.958
[Dani] All right, you two, line up!

34:41.625 --> 34:42.500
[Dani giggles]

34:44.083 --> 34:45.083
Hmm.

34:45.833 --> 34:48.000
Pajamas seem to be in order.

34:48.666 --> 34:49.500
[chuckles]

34:49.583 --> 34:50.708
Let's see those hands.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.166
Good, good.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.250
Sure. Teeth!

34:56.333 --> 34:57.875
[teeth clack]

34:58.958 --> 34:59.791
Ahh.

35:00.666 --> 35:01.500
[Dani giggles]

35:04.041 --> 35:05.250
You did so well…

35:06.000 --> 35:07.208
that, as a reward,

35:08.708 --> 35:09.958
we can play a game.

35:10.416 --> 35:11.250
Hm?

35:12.125 --> 35:13.041
Any game you like.

35:13.541 --> 35:16.916
We'll be back in our beds
before too long, right?

35:17.458 --> 35:19.458
We can't be out of our rooms too late.

35:19.875 --> 35:20.708
[Dani] We won't.

35:25.625 --> 35:26.458
Hide-and-seek!

35:27.291 --> 35:29.208
Okay, hide-and-seek, sure.

35:29.708 --> 35:32.291
-Is that all right with you, Miles?
-[Flora] Please?

35:34.208 --> 35:36.166
[crickets chirping]

35:39.583 --> 35:43.583
-[Dani] Ten, nine, eight…
-[footsteps running]

35:44.500 --> 35:47.083
…seven, six…

35:47.833 --> 35:50.500
five, four…

35:51.041 --> 35:52.250
three…

35:52.333 --> 35:55.000
two, one.

35:55.083 --> 35:56.791
Ready or not, here I come!

37:03.791 --> 37:06.000
-[clock ticking quietly]
-[door creaks]

37:25.375 --> 37:27.375
[wind whistling softly]

38:22.041 --> 38:24.083
[Dani] You aren't down here, are you?

38:29.583 --> 38:31.541
This wing is off limits, game or not.

38:33.166 --> 38:34.000
Okay?

38:56.208 --> 38:57.125
[thud]

38:57.208 --> 38:59.333
[music box playing "O Willow Waly" softly]

39:17.250 --> 39:18.708
[door creaks open]

39:20.458 --> 39:22.458
[music box tune grows louder]

39:38.750 --> 39:42.833
[Flora humming "O Willow Waly"]

39:45.208 --> 39:48.541
[reedy voice joins Flora
humming "O Willow Waly"]

39:54.041 --> 39:56.041
[music box continues playing]

40:08.375 --> 40:12.000
[Flora and voice continue humming]

40:13.166 --> 40:14.250
[Flora stops humming]

40:14.333 --> 40:17.458
[other voice grows loud and strangled]

40:17.541 --> 40:18.375
Shh!

40:18.458 --> 40:19.333
[voice stops]

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
[Flora resumes humming]

40:25.875 --> 40:27.458
[music box continues playing]

40:28.791 --> 40:30.666
-Got you!
-Jesus, Miles!

40:30.750 --> 40:32.500
-Got you.
-I'm supposed to be looking for you,

40:32.583 --> 40:34.583
-and this wing is off--
-I'm going to start counting,

40:34.666 --> 40:36.833
and it'll be your turn to run and hide.

40:37.958 --> 40:38.791
I'll find you.

40:39.125 --> 40:40.083
[strained] Ease up!

40:40.583 --> 40:41.541
Ease up!

40:45.875 --> 40:48.791
[Miles, yelling] One! Two! Three!

40:49.333 --> 40:50.500
-Four!
-Miles!

40:50.583 --> 40:52.291
-Five…
-No, game over!

40:52.791 --> 40:55.041
-[Miles in distance] Seven! Eight!
-Miles!

40:55.125 --> 40:56.041
[Miles] Nine!

40:58.166 --> 40:59.000
[Dani] Miles.

40:59.083 --> 41:00.416
[rapid steps]

41:01.791 --> 41:03.041
Flora!

41:07.583 --> 41:09.583
Olly, olly, oxen free!

41:09.666 --> 41:10.500
Hm.

41:10.583 --> 41:11.416
[creaking sound]

41:12.333 --> 41:14.500
[wind whistling]

41:18.833 --> 41:19.666
Hey.

41:23.333 --> 41:24.166
[sighs]

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
[wind howling eerily]

41:30.375 --> 41:31.958
[door creaking]

41:33.291 --> 41:35.000
Shit. [breathes shakily]

41:38.125 --> 41:39.041
[gasps softly] Oh.

41:41.291 --> 41:43.083
[echoing gasps]

41:53.708 --> 41:55.708
[wind resumes whistling]

41:58.416 --> 42:00.416
[eerie music building]

42:01.583 --> 42:02.458
[frightened gasp]

42:04.541 --> 42:06.000
[panting]

42:16.541 --> 42:19.500
[softly] I'm gonna call
the fucking police. I'm-- I'm gonna…

42:19.583 --> 42:22.000
[yells] I'm gonna call the fucking police!

42:24.500 --> 42:25.375
Dani.

42:28.708 --> 42:30.375
I-I don't feel so good.

42:34.208 --> 42:35.333
-[thuds]
-[Dani gasps]

42:39.208 --> 42:40.583
-Oh, God.
-[Dani] I saw him.

42:40.791 --> 42:41.916
I swear to God.

42:42.000 --> 42:42.875
In the window.

42:42.958 --> 42:44.916
Same guy. Same guy as yesterday.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.125
I-I'll lock the doors.

42:48.916 --> 42:50.791
Hey! Hey, hey!

42:50.875 --> 42:53.625
It's okay! You're okay, you're okay!
He's awake!

42:53.708 --> 42:55.041
[sinister clashing sound]

42:55.500 --> 42:57.583
-[Hannah] Oh, thank goodness.
-[Dani] He's awake.

42:57.666 --> 42:59.375
-[Hannah] Thank God.
-[Dani] He's awake.

42:59.458 --> 43:00.333
He's awake.

43:05.541 --> 43:07.666
[frightening music building
to final close]

43:11.875 --> 43:13.833
[closing music playing]
