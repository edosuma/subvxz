01:15.920 --> 01:17.114
All right, honey.

01:17.320 --> 01:20.357
Now, let's try
a little bit harder word.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.710
How about "dog"?

01:22.920 --> 01:25.514
Come on, honey,
I know you can do it.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.279
Okay.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.112
D.

01:42.360 --> 01:44.954
O? Okay.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.597
"Og. "

01:50.400 --> 01:52.675
Dog.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.319
G.

01:58.320 --> 02:00.754
G? Well, why don't you
finish the rest?

02:00.960 --> 02:03.155
"Gee, she's stupid. "

02:04.200 --> 02:06.191
Let's see you finish the word,
smarty-pants.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.311
Oh, "dog. "

02:11.960 --> 02:13.234
Like in "dogmatic. "

02:13.440 --> 02:15.476
Oh, of course.

02:23.080 --> 02:26.914
Hey, Kel. You look kind of puzzled.
Someone ask you to spell "dog"?

02:30.160 --> 02:32.515
Oh, my God, they did.

02:33.280 --> 02:34.952
Let me see what we got in the mail.

02:36.240 --> 02:39.676
Bills, bills, bills.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.030
Letter from Al's mother.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.276
Bills, bills.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.358
Here, honey, go play with these.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.715
Now, this is what
I've been waiting for.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.430
<i>Bud's invitation to
the Oldest Virgins in America Club?</i>

02:57.200 --> 03:00.431
No. It's a letter
from the Board of Education.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.518
An application
to send little Seven to school.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.075
Oh, cool.
I can help him with his studies...

03:07.280 --> 03:09.874
...because I be
a high school graduate.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.429
Yes, honey, and we be
very proud of you.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.353
Actually, I requested this...

03:16.560 --> 03:19.552
...because just the other day,
I saw the school bus go by...

03:19.760 --> 03:22.752
<i>...and I felt what every mother
feels deep inside:</i>

03:22.960 --> 03:27.238
Those bus drivers are getting younger
and cuter every year.

03:27.720 --> 03:31.190
So while I was taking
my oh-so-cold shower...

03:31.400 --> 03:35.598
...I thought, "Gee, maybe I should just
send Seven to school. "

03:35.800 --> 03:37.119
Let's see here.

03:37.320 --> 03:38.833
"Age. "

03:39.080 --> 03:40.991
Thirty...

03:41.960 --> 03:43.632
Twenty-eight.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.595
Mom? I think they mean
Seven's age.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.480
I thought they'd want mine on here
for the traditional...

03:50.720 --> 03:54.599
..."mommy takes bus driver to dinner,
dancing and Jacuzzi" interlude.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.318
Come here, honey.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.395
When's your birthday, Seven?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.399
I don't know.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.556
Well, didn't you ever
have a birthday party?

04:06.800 --> 04:08.313
No.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.236
Well, we're gonna fix that
right now...

04:12.480 --> 04:15.278
...because I want you
to have birthdays, schooling...

04:15.480 --> 04:18.471
...vaccinations, friends, a future.

04:18.680 --> 04:21.672
Everything the authorities
wanted Kelly and Bud to have.

04:22.760 --> 04:26.309
So we're gonna pick you out a birthday
and then have a party.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.229
Now, it has to be a very special day
that no one else celebrates.

04:30.440 --> 04:34.433
Let's see. How about January 22nd?

04:34.920 --> 04:37.195
That's my birthday, Mom.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.634
Really?

04:38.840 --> 04:42.230
Oh, well. Okay. November 27th.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.398
That's mine.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.518
Really?

04:46.800 --> 04:48.358
Well, this is hard.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.710
How about December 25th?

04:50.960 --> 04:53.474
Mom, that's Christmas.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.153
Yeah, but at least
it's nobody's birthday.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.359
What?

05:05.480 --> 05:07.277
All right. How about tomorrow?

05:07.480 --> 05:10.278
- Nothing is happening tomorrow.
- I don't think so.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.391
Okay. That settles it.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.910
Tomorrow is Seven's birthday.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.392
Hi, honey. Do you know
what tomorrow is?

05:27.760 --> 05:29.478
Well, yes.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.757
Yes, I do.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.194
And I can't believe
that after all these years...

05:35.400 --> 05:37.914
...you remembered my birthday.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.796
Was that your birthday?

05:49.000 --> 05:52.515
Well, it's not your birthday anymore.
I just gave it to Seven.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.314
What about me?

05:55.600 --> 06:00.879
Al, every night you go to bed whining,
" I wanna die, I wanna die. "

06:01.080 --> 06:03.594
And now, all of a sudden,
you want more birthdays?

06:05.280 --> 06:08.078
Oh, honey. All right.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.271
I'll give you the dog's birthday.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.268
You seem to age about seven years
every year anyway.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.597
I- I want a human birthday.

06:19.080 --> 06:23.198
Well, then you'll just have to get
on your hind legs and beg for it.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.995
Seven, as part of your
birthday presents...

06:27.200 --> 06:30.192
...you can have whatever you want
out of Kelly and Bud's rooms.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.391
Oh, boy!

06:33.280 --> 06:35.555
Well, Kel, there goes
those art photos you took...

06:35.760 --> 06:38.399
<i>...for Stupid Girls in Chains magazine.</i>

06:39.200 --> 06:41.873
Oh, yeah? Well, you can say goodbye
to your "so lifelike...

06:42.080 --> 06:45.197
...you can take her home to meet Mom"
rubber playmate.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.711
Isis!

06:53.120 --> 06:55.156
Isis!

06:55.360 --> 06:57.396
Isis!

06:57.600 --> 07:00.831
Oh, God! Call 911 fast!

07:01.120 --> 07:02.599
She's running out of air!

07:02.800 --> 07:05.598
Oh, the horror, the horror!

07:07.760 --> 07:10.797
Well, there go your dreams of ever
having any rubber grandchildren.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.191
Hey, look at these pictures.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.839
Gotta go.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.277
You know, Al, I really think
we ought to have some more kids.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.630
I think we could get it right
one of these days.

07:23.840 --> 07:28.231
Peg, at my age, I couldn't get it right
if I was with somebody I wanted.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.031
All right, McGrumpy.

07:31.240 --> 07:34.073
I know you're a little down
about this birthday thing...

07:34.280 --> 07:38.114
...and I know I have no power
to get you back up again.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.837
Oh, snookums.

07:42.040 --> 07:43.519
Come on, Al.

07:43.720 --> 07:47.395
If anybody really cared about your
birthday, what would you have wanted?

07:47.600 --> 07:50.239
Isis. When she was healthy.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.998
Peggy, could you settle
an argument for us?

07:59.760 --> 08:03.275
If someone was eyeing Al, drooling
for his body, would you be mad?

08:03.720 --> 08:06.712
You know, curiously enough,
that happens every day.

08:06.920 --> 08:10.230
I just shoo those buzzards away
with my broom.

08:10.440 --> 08:14.752
Then I say, " I don't care what
it smells like, he's not dead yet. "

08:15.720 --> 08:17.756
Look, I- I can't help it
if women want me.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.712
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

08:19.920 --> 08:23.833
Stop getting my hair done
and looking killer?

08:25.000 --> 08:28.959
Well, you could stop swinging
your buttocks like a common trollop...

08:29.160 --> 08:31.674
...your wedding ring
hidden in your pants...

08:32.559 --> 08:35.198
...with that roll of socks.

08:37.640 --> 08:41.837
Yeah. Nature's socks, baby.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.476
Let me help out here.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.077
If you're worried about Jefferson
succumbing to another woman...

08:50.280 --> 08:52.316
...let me put your mind at ease.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.829
He will always be true to you
because, after all...

08:55.040 --> 08:59.909
...why go out for milk when you
got two tiny, empty pints at home?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.679
And why go out for hot dogs...

09:04.880 --> 09:08.316
...when you've got a tiny little
cocktail frank at home?

09:12.960 --> 09:15.679
Attached to the whole pig.

09:19.880 --> 09:22.792
I don't go over to her house
and insult her.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.873
Gee, what's the matter with him?

09:26.120 --> 09:28.076
Well, he's a shoe salesman.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.759
And he's losing his hair.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.520
And he wouldn't know a shower
if he fell over it.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.917
And he has this horrible rash
on his butt.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.874
Not that. I mean, why is he so sad?

09:40.880 --> 09:42.677
Do you really care?

09:43.640 --> 09:46.279
- No.
- Actually, tomorrow's Seven's birthday.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.232
Where's a good place
to have a party?

09:48.440 --> 09:50.635
We generally like to be someplace
where we can...

09:50.880 --> 09:54.077
...toss our garbage on the floor
and not worry about picking it up.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.393
Yes, but rather than having it here...

09:57.840 --> 10:00.513
...why not do something grand
and well within your budget...

10:00.720 --> 10:02.517
...and have it in a public park?

10:02.800 --> 10:06.634
Yeah. A lot of women
like to look at me there.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.277
And here...

10:11.480 --> 10:14.756
...and here...

10:14.960 --> 10:18.270
...and here.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.991
Of course. When you flaunt the line
of your leopard underwear...

10:23.200 --> 10:25.760
...through your far-too-thin pants...

10:25.960 --> 10:27.632
...you're begging for it, mister.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.798
And someday, some big woman's
gonna give it to you hard, hard...

10:31.000 --> 10:32.718
...right in the park!

10:36.720 --> 10:39.678
Take me home right now
and dance for me.

10:40.320 --> 10:44.029
All right, all right. But this time,
don't invite your mom. Okay?

10:44.240 --> 10:48.119
<i>My dancing is an art
and not to be cheapened by:</i>

10:48.320 --> 10:49.753
"That's my son-in-law.

10:49.960 --> 10:53.191
Shake your moneymaker
over to Mommy. "

10:54.560 --> 10:55.834
You always hated my mother.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.315
No, I- I like dollars, damn it,
not coins.

10:58.520 --> 11:01.512
I'm not a tollbooth,
for God's sakes.

11:05.520 --> 11:07.636
Al, would you ever consider
dancing for me?

11:07.840 --> 11:10.638
Only at the end of a rope, baby.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.758
You better get it
out of your system...

11:13.960 --> 11:17.111
...because I want only smiles tomorrow
at Seven's birthday.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.993
Gee, I hope he's not too disappointed
that it's in the park.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.872
The kid is nothing but a stupid hick.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.548
We'll tell him it's Disneyland.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.552
This isn't Disneyland!

11:31.000 --> 11:33.560
Wow, Disneyland!

11:36.840 --> 11:39.832
Oh, and look,
plenty of space for parking.

11:41.160 --> 11:44.357
Well, it's time to party.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.757
Who wants a hot dog?

11:47.240 --> 11:48.753
That's good because I got one.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.188
- Me, me.
- Me.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.790
Hold it now! Hold it now! You know
the rules. You don't call it for it.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.272
You fight for it...

11:56.480 --> 11:59.552
...which is why we Bundys might be
maladjusted, but we are strong.

12:01.040 --> 12:03.838
Excuse me.
What are you doing here?

12:04.840 --> 12:07.354
Well, between you and me,
I'm celebrating my birthday...

12:07.560 --> 12:10.597
...but nobody knows
because my wife took it away from me.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.994
Interesting tale. But meaningless.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.397
You see, I rented this entire park
for my son Brian's birthday party.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.512
So take your pathetic weenie
and go elsewhere.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.515
Does everyone know, Al?

12:28.440 --> 12:30.317
Now, listen here, buddy...

12:31.240 --> 12:33.151
...you cannot buy a public park.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.237
I pay good taxes
to support this place.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.317
Al, you haven't paid taxes in years.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.273
And I would feel
quite the fool right now if I had.

12:40.480 --> 12:45.110
Look, our party is due to start.
Don't make me throw you out bodily.

12:47.480 --> 12:48.754
Peg...

12:49.160 --> 12:51.515
...would you please
hold my weenie?

12:53.560 --> 12:56.518
Well, what'll I do
with my other four fingers?

13:01.280 --> 13:05.193
All right, Goldfinger. Let's rock.

13:07.760 --> 13:11.230
Don't get Phillip mad.
He's a fifth-degree master in kung fu.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.479
Yeah, well, don't get Al mad.
He's a fifth-grade spelling bee winner.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.157
Now, look here. I may not be rich...

13:23.680 --> 13:25.432
...or happy...

13:25.640 --> 13:27.437
...but I know this is a public park.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.712
And in a country of the people,
by the people and for the people...

13:30.920 --> 13:35.357
...there's gotta be a place set aside
for scum like us.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.233
This isn't so bad, kids.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.670
Just because we
don't get to use the whole park...

13:59.920 --> 14:01.558
...don't mean we can't have fun.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.990
Bud, go long.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.874
Gee, Dad. Touchdown.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.470
Kelly, extra-point time.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.033
Come on.

14:19.480 --> 14:22.153
Yes! Yes!

14:23.960 --> 14:26.394
This sucks.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.354
No kidding.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.028
Why aren't you people
having any fun?

14:31.240 --> 14:35.199
Aren't you tired
of only celebrating my birthdays?

14:35.880 --> 14:41.671
You know, that sit-down dinner for 300
of my closest friends at Cafe Poof...

14:41.880 --> 14:43.632
<i>...where the guest of honour, moi...</i>

14:43.840 --> 14:48.118
...gets to eat scrambled eggs
off the chests of exotic male dancers.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.548
I didn't invite you?

14:52.760 --> 14:54.034
By the looks of your faces...

14:54.240 --> 14:58.358
...I realize it's because you
would only have brought me down.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.155
But let's make this party
the best party in the park.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.558
Well, maybe the second-best party.

15:06.760 --> 15:09.194
The rich people hired
the Blue Angels.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.590
Hey, look, they're skywriting.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.358
" Happy birthday, Brian.

15:13.560 --> 15:17.030
This is costing your dad $50,000.

15:17.240 --> 15:20.471
And why not? You're the best kid
in the whole world.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.797
And we're not just writing that
because we're being paid.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.433
We mean it, really.

15:25.640 --> 15:28.234
May God bless you and keep you.

15:28.840 --> 15:31.559
And don't forget,
we also do weddings.

15:32.240 --> 15:36.870
Except in April when we're booked
for the Peggy Bundy birthday bash. "

15:37.880 --> 15:40.394
Hi, boys!

15:40.920 --> 15:43.275
Every kid at school has skywriting.

15:43.480 --> 15:44.959
You don't love me anymore.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.469
Yes, I do, son. Look at this.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.671
Hey, boys and girls.

15:53.360 --> 15:55.032
Hi, Peggy.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.875
Frank, is that you in there?

15:58.080 --> 15:59.479
Hi.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.149
See you in April.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.272
Now, kids, Brian's dad
paid me a lot of money...

16:04.480 --> 16:08.155
...to break my leg for Brian
on his birthday.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.557
And it hurts real bad.

16:12.960 --> 16:16.589
Come on, kids,
it's time for shrimp cocktail.

16:18.160 --> 16:19.957
They're eating shrimp, kids.

16:20.160 --> 16:21.639
That's fish.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.876
Nothing says party like pork.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.957
And I'll do the slicing.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.594
- Hey, now, watch it now!
- Give me a piece.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.834
Well, I guess we're a
two-hot-dog family now.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.553
Wait a second, now.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.228
Before everybody but me eats...

16:47.640 --> 16:49.551
...let's give thanks.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.309
Dogs are busy today.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.872
Amen.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.395
Dig in.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.989
All right, well,
who has the mustard?

17:04.560 --> 17:09.190
Let's see.
Salt, pepper, ketchup, condom.

17:24.280 --> 17:25.633
All right.

17:25.839 --> 17:29.879
Now, Seven,
I've got dessert for you.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.548
Noogie, noogie, noogie.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.795
Koosh, koosh, koosh.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.230
Yum, yum, yummy!

17:37.720 --> 17:40.154
She never " noogie, noogied" us.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.352
Never " kooshed" us, either.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.354
Well, she "yum, yummed" me once
in high school.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.268
And to think, I spelled "dog"
for that woman...

17:50.480 --> 17:51.913
...and we're the forgotten ones.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.873
We're the Titos
of the Jackson family.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.274
It's unfair.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.710
Nobody asked us
if we wanted this stupid kid.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.675
Well, don't feel bad, honey. Nobody
asked me if I wanted you two guys.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.794
All I'm saying is I can't believe
he's getting Mom's love.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.268
He's not even a real Bundy.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.273
He's no kind of Bundy.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.232
Bundy's a name you earn.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.955
Our emotional scars run so deep,
you can almost see them.

18:16.200 --> 18:17.633
Yup, it's a point of pride.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.673
<i>Ever since the day the first Bundy
stepped off the Mayflower...</i>

18:20.880 --> 18:22.552
...halfway over.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.635
<i>Never found him, but they recorded
his final words:</i>

18:25.880 --> 18:27.871
" Methinks we're here. "

18:28.400 --> 18:32.154
Pioneers like that and ourselves,
we're the real Bundys.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.954
Why, that kid never suffered
any real rejection.

18:35.160 --> 18:36.115
<i>Not until he's heard:</i>

18:36.360 --> 18:37.918
"The service entrance is in back. "

18:38.160 --> 18:42.392
Or, "Or not even for 50 bucks. "

18:42.600 --> 18:44.352
Yeah, or, " Don't ruin it by talking. "

18:44.560 --> 18:47.358
Right. Right.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.512
And until that time, he's just another
human being with a future.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.392
Never be a real Bundy.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.033
Oh, kids, look.

18:56.240 --> 18:59.710
Seven's playing piñata
with the other kids.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.514
Keep him in here...

19:03.720 --> 19:05.119
...where he belongs.

19:05.360 --> 19:09.114
This birthday stinks.
I wanna go home.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.237
Me too. Let's go.

19:11.440 --> 19:14.000
Not just yet.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.348
Excuse me.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.959
What do you think you're doing?

19:29.160 --> 19:31.515
You're not allowed
out of the doody area.

19:31.720 --> 19:32.948
Only we're allowed out here.

19:33.160 --> 19:34.718
Read this permit, pal.

19:35.880 --> 19:41.113
Bud, show the man
what Bundys think of permits.

19:56.080 --> 20:00.073
You could have saved me a little bit.
I didn't get no hot dog, you know?

20:01.960 --> 20:05.555
Anyway, the kid here
wants a crack at your piñata.

20:05.840 --> 20:09.310
- Oh, no, no. Wait a minute. Hold on.
- And I want one of them burgers.

20:09.520 --> 20:12.478
And I reclaim this park
for the people!

20:12.680 --> 20:15.194
And I reclaim this hot dog
for the people...

20:15.400 --> 20:17.277
...and this steak for the people.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.999
That's mine! That's it!

20:19.200 --> 20:20.758
Eat hot Gucci, pal.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.189
You know, buddy,
it seems your foot is stuck.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.638
I'll give you 100 bucks if you let go.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.348
Take it, Al. Take it.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.429
Nobody gave me
a birthday present...

20:38.640 --> 20:40.949
...so I guess I'll give myself one.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.716
Happy birthday, Al.

20:51.560 --> 20:55.394
Come on, kids.
Let's kick some rich butt.

21:12.120 --> 21:15.271
You're ruining my party,
you baboon.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.633
I'm proud to call that baboon
my daddy.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.035
Family meeting!

21:37.520 --> 21:40.034
In the name of Bundys
all over the world...

21:40.240 --> 21:43.630
...I declare this party
open to the people!

21:43.880 --> 21:46.030
Peg, grab all the food
so no one else gets it...

21:46.240 --> 21:47.878
...and grab the presents for Seven.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.596
Dad, did you see Seven
slug that kid?

21:50.800 --> 21:52.677
He's a mean little booger.

21:53.360 --> 21:57.353
Yeah, and who knows,
he might even prove to be stupid too.

21:57.640 --> 21:58.993
I think he's a real Bundy.

21:59.240 --> 22:03.870
Me too. I declare Seven
an official Bundy!

22:04.080 --> 22:06.150
Can I get a unified "Whoa, Bundy"?

22:06.360 --> 22:09.636
Whoa, Bundy!

22:10.305 --> 22:16.476
