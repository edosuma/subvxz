WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.170
- Previously on "Shooter"...

00:04.272 --> 00:06.107
- What can I do for you,
Captain?

00:06.140 --> 00:07.541
- Ten days ago, a CIA agent
was shot by a sniper.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.144
We believe this is
the work of T. Solotov.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.545
- I know that you don't like
to talk about this stuff,

00:11.579 --> 00:13.147
but what happened to Donnie,

00:13.181 --> 00:14.515
I know that it
still hurts you.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.384
- Donnie, no!

00:16.417 --> 00:18.319
[gunshot]

00:18.352 --> 00:19.653
- He died because
I trusted my gut.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.822
He died because
Solotov shot him.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.058
- Whatever you think
you know about Solotov,

00:24.092 --> 00:26.160
he knows ten times about you.
He's a master sniper.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.462
- And that's exactly
why I need you, Bob Lee.

00:28.496 --> 00:31.232
The only reason I signed up
for any of this is

00:31.265 --> 00:32.600
because I thought
we were doing something

00:32.633 --> 00:34.135
that served a greater purpose.

00:34.168 --> 00:37.138
[dramatic music]

*

00:39.173 --> 00:41.575
[speaking native language]

00:41.609 --> 00:44.112
- It's nothing.
- You framed me for murder.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.080
- Whether or not you want
to admit it, you need my help.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.615
- Yeah, well, I left them
in the dirt.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.417
Someday I'm gonna do
the same thing to you.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.651
- I'm sorry for
what I did to you.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.286
- Don't let me
see you again.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.454
The bigger the conspiracy,

00:53.487 --> 00:54.555
the bigger the people involved.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.290
- Then we'll expose them all.

00:56.324 --> 00:57.858
All the way to the top.
As high as it goes.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.660
- You're the National
Security Advisor, right?

00:59.693 --> 01:01.462
You advise the president

01:01.495 --> 01:03.164
on which foreign leaders
to meet with and where?

01:03.197 --> 01:04.565
- You're a smart one,
aren't you?

01:04.598 --> 01:06.434
- You put the President
of the United States

01:06.467 --> 01:08.336
in Seattle
with the Ukrainian president.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.271
[gunshot]

01:10.304 --> 01:13.307
- My name is Bob Lee Swagger!
I did not kill the president!

01:13.341 --> 01:15.109
- When you go to
the store tomorrow,

01:15.143 --> 01:16.710
don't forget to pick up
some blueberries.

01:16.744 --> 01:17.711
- I won't forget.

01:17.745 --> 01:19.613
[panting]

01:19.647 --> 01:23.351
[tea kettle whistles]

01:23.384 --> 01:25.253
- I want out.
- No.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.288
- I betrayed everything
I've believed in for you.

01:27.321 --> 01:31.192
- The real problem is about
to reveal itself.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.194
- Don't send anyone after me.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.562
- I won't have to.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.365
Bob Lee Swagger,
you are exonerated

01:37.398 --> 01:39.600
for the assassination
of the Ukrainian president.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.302
- What if I want justice?

01:41.335 --> 01:44.205
- You'll have to settle
for freedom.

01:53.647 --> 01:57.185
- On behalf of Commander
Fleet Marine Forces, Europe,

01:57.218 --> 02:00.321
Boeblingen, Germany,
we invite to the podium,

02:00.354 --> 02:02.923
Gunnery Sergeant
Bob Lee Swagger.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.625
ALL: Swagger!

02:04.658 --> 02:06.394
[cheers and applause]

02:06.427 --> 02:07.928

- [whistles]

02:09.230 --> 02:12.233
[applause]

02:14.702 --> 02:17.771
- Chesty Puller said, "A Marine
doctor is a Navy corpsman,

02:17.805 --> 02:20.241
and there's no better
in the business."

02:20.274 --> 02:22.176
For the men of 8113,

02:22.210 --> 02:23.644
Senior Chief Petty Officer
Kevin Campbell

02:23.677 --> 02:25.379
was that corpsman.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.780
Today he receives
the Silver Star

02:26.814 --> 02:28.716
for bravery and valor

02:28.749 --> 02:30.351
when his battalion
entered a minefield

02:30.384 --> 02:33.254
on March 21st of this year.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.556
When one of the Marines
detonated a mine,

02:35.589 --> 02:37.725
Doc Campbell didn't hesitate.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.394
For the next five hours,
he supervised the care

02:40.428 --> 02:41.795
and evacuation
of those Marines

02:41.829 --> 02:43.597
without regard
to his own injuries.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.466
If you ask any Marine,

02:45.499 --> 02:47.235
the reason we fought
was to make sure

02:47.268 --> 02:49.603
we all got to come home,

02:49.637 --> 02:52.206
and we fought for the memories
of those who didn't.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.210
Doc Campbell, from all the men
of the 8113

02:56.244 --> 02:58.379
and the countless Marines
you've helped,

02:58.412 --> 03:00.614
our sincerest thank you.

03:00.648 --> 03:03.651
[applause]

03:12.826 --> 03:15.729
- I appreciate this honor,
and it is an honor,

03:15.763 --> 03:19.433
but the real praise goes out
to all the strong men and women

03:19.467 --> 03:21.602
who continue to fight
long after we've come home.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.772
It's those soldiers
that we are indebted to,

03:24.805 --> 03:27.308
and we remember them
every day.

03:27.341 --> 03:32.380
It has been the privilege
of my life to serve with you.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.647
Thank you.

03:53.501 --> 03:54.802
- It's time to move!
Time to move!

03:54.835 --> 03:56.437
- Is there a back door?
- Yes! That way!

03:56.470 --> 03:57.505
- Follow me! Follow me!

03:57.538 --> 03:59.740

- One step at a time. Follow me.
Keep your heads low, all right?

04:25.499 --> 04:27.301
When we hit the street,
you turn right and you run.

04:27.335 --> 04:29.503
- Run to where?
- Julie, you guys get low,

04:29.537 --> 04:30.904
and don't stand till
I give you the sign, copy?

04:30.938 --> 04:33.307
- Got it!
- Tio, take left!

04:33.341 --> 04:35.309
I'm gonna clear the lobby!
- Copy!

04:35.343 --> 04:42.350

04:46.454 --> 04:49.357

- He's dead.

04:51.692 --> 04:56.597
*

04:56.630 --> 04:58.932
- Man, I'm not risking
a twitch detonation.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.435
I'm gonna neutralize his vest.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.736

You just asked me
if I could bake a cake.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.560
No, I meant to ask you that.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.595
[chuckles]
I'm kidding.

06:01.629 --> 06:03.864
What--what do you do for work?

06:03.897 --> 06:06.667
- Finance.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.702
How long are you in Frankfurt?

06:08.736 --> 06:12.406
- A couple of weeks,
and then I'll be back a lot.

How was the workout?

08:30.878 --> 08:32.112
- It was fine.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.314
Got you some soup.

Where you off to?

09:14.622 --> 09:17.625
- I'm busy, Daddy.
- Hey, what about lunch?

09:17.658 --> 09:21.361
- You can just wrap it up and
put it in the fridge for now.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.864
She only ate the jelly
out of her PB&J.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.634

That's what I used to do.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.368
- [scoffs]

09:28.401 --> 09:29.770
You should shower up
and get ready.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.038
We're gonna be late.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.073
- Baby, we have four hours.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.809
- It's an international flight.
I mean, I still don't understand

09:35.843 --> 09:36.977
why you have to go all the way
to Frankfurt

09:37.010 --> 09:38.746
to give him the award, but--

09:38.779 --> 09:40.814
- 'Cause he and his guys
are still at Landstuhl.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.683
- That's not exactly Paris.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.686
- No, it's not, but it is
a free trip to Europe.

09:45.719 --> 09:48.689
- [scoffs] You mean a free trip
to see the boys.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.859
- We had a long year, Jules.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.961
Without you and Mary
and those guys,

09:53.994 --> 09:55.128
I don't know what
I would have done.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.966
- Well, don't forget, we need
the extra time at the airport.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.934
You know,
you're Bob Lee Swagger.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.970
You have lots of security
and people recognizing you.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.638
- Maybe we'll get lucky
and nobody will notice me.

10:04.672 --> 10:05.973
- Yeah, right.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.108
I laid out some suits
on the bed.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.810
Let me know which one you want
to take, I'll pack it.

10:09.843 --> 10:11.712
- I have to wear a suit?

10:11.745 --> 10:13.146
- Hell, yeah, you have
to wear a suit.

10:13.180 --> 10:14.715
You promised me a night
without the boys,

10:14.748 --> 10:17.017
and I expect to be romanced.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.152
And I'm still holding you
to the trip to Paris.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.888
- Yes, ma'am.

10:22.923 --> 10:25.959
- Hey, mija, slow down.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.895
We've got the whole
weekend to run.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.130
- Hey, Kiddo,
give Estella a break.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.966
Thank you for doing this.
- Oh, doing what?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.736
I've been breaking horses
for 25 years.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.037
What's one little girl?

10:38.071 --> 10:40.941
- Mmm!
Bye, my sweet girl.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.043
I love you
infinity times infinity.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.177
- That means forever.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.747
- It sure does.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.148
- Don't forget
my coins, Daddy.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.917
- I won't forget your coins.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.985
- This is the worst part.

10:52.019 --> 10:54.087
- Mom.
- I'm gonna miss you so much!

10:54.121 --> 10:55.856
Will you make me videos
every day with Estella?

10:55.889 --> 10:56.990
- Yes.
- Like ten a day?

10:57.024 --> 10:58.692
- Mom.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.761
BOTH: I love you.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.062

all the numbers, right?

11:02.095 --> 11:03.764
- Oh, yes.
- Hotel information?

11:03.797 --> 11:05.966
- I have three copies,
so go on, go!

11:05.999 --> 11:07.835
We're gonna be fine.
Here, I made this for you.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.002
- Thank you, I appreciate it.
No, you're so sweet.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.170
Thank you, though.
Bye, honey!

11:10.203 --> 11:11.805
MARY: Bye, Mom!

11:14.842 --> 11:16.744
Mom!
Mommy, wait!

11:16.777 --> 11:19.079
- Yeah, baby?

11:19.112 --> 11:21.481
- I made something for you

11:21.514 --> 11:25.185
so every time you look at it
you remember me.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.055
- I'm not gonna forget you.
Are you kidding me?

11:28.088 --> 11:29.790
BOTH: I love you.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.759
- And we'll miss you.
Okay, run inside.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.126
Estella's waiting for you.
- Okay.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.798
I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too, Mouse.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.334
It's gonna be fine.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.870
Better than fine.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.905
We could use a few days.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.506
- Germany, here we come.

11:57.050 --> 11:57.217
.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.085
- Estella taught me
a new word.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.956
"Aw-veed-is-zanie."
It means good-bye.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.224
You can use it.

12:04.257 --> 12:08.095
I love you, Mommy and Daddy.

12:08.128 --> 12:11.031
- Baby, how many times
you gonna watch that?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.165
- Maybe 100 million.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.034
[chuckles]

12:14.067 --> 12:15.102
I miss her.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.004
- I do too.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.238
[spits in sink]

12:18.271 --> 12:20.107
But I am glad
we did this.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.976
- Yeah, me too.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.312
- I know the move
to Texas was hard,

12:25.345 --> 12:27.881
but I promise you,
it'll get better.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.986
- Look, anywhere we are
is home to me.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.788
I think I just thought
things would be easier

12:34.822 --> 12:36.790
after some time passed.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.292
- Baby, the world's gonna
move on, trust me.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.864
- Mary does love Texas.
It's been good for her.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.565
- Yeah.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.400
- She's already riding better
than I was at her age.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.337
- Well, she's stubborn;
that's half the battle.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.874
- Huh, I wonder
who she got that from?

12:53.907 --> 12:55.575
You.
- What about you?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.144
- I'm not stubborn.
- You're pretty stubborn.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.846
- No, I'm not.
- You're pretty stubborn.

12:58.879 --> 12:59.512
Yes, you are.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.250
- Your job is great
for our sex life,

13:03.283 --> 13:06.419
but not so great for my job.

13:06.453 --> 13:10.090
- Tell the senator you had
an interdepartmental meeting.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.259
- Is that what
we're calling this?

13:12.292 --> 13:14.594
- It sounds better
than a nooner.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.297
- Gun takes a little
getting used to.

13:17.330 --> 13:21.034
Not that it isn't sexy,
just slightly emasculating.

13:21.068 --> 13:23.270
- You're the man, I'm just
a secretary with a badge.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.839
- You are a Senior Special Agent
with the FBI,

13:25.873 --> 13:28.141
and that is a hell of a lot more
than a secretary.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.043
At least they moved you to D.C.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.012
They can't keep you
behind a desk forever.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.882
- Are you kidding?
The FBI invented the desk

13:34.915 --> 13:37.885
so that agents would have
something to sit behind.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.252
And I didn't ask
for this transfer.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.888
Nobody would knowingly
want to work for

13:40.921 --> 13:42.923
The Office
of Personnel Management.

13:42.956 --> 13:47.060
- Well, the road to the top
is not always straight.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.362
And if they didn't transfer you,
you wouldn't have met me.

13:49.396 --> 13:50.397
- Excellent point.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.465
[phone buzzes]

13:52.499 --> 13:53.833
- [Harris sighs]

13:55.502 --> 13:57.437
Dinner Saturday?

13:58.471 --> 14:01.274
- Um, I thought you had
that security thing.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.276
- Yeah, I meant after.

14:03.310 --> 14:06.179
- [laughs]

14:06.213 --> 14:08.048
You know, just because
we skipped lunch today

14:08.081 --> 14:10.150
doesn't mean you don't
still have to impress me.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.386
- I see.

14:15.989 --> 14:17.424
- Okay, thanks.

14:20.460 --> 14:23.163
- You're not really
gonna eat that, are you?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.965
- You know, for someone
in the intelligence business,

14:24.998 --> 14:26.166
you're not very smart.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.935
- Get in.
I'll drop you.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.036
- I don't mind walking.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.171
- I do.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.872
Get in, and leave that.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.212
So how are things at the DMV?

14:39.246 --> 14:41.681
- Funny, I never
heard that one before.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.450
How's the private sector?

14:43.483 --> 14:46.386
I heard you gave a speech
at Putin's birthday party.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.189
- If I only attended the
birthday parties of my friends,

14:49.222 --> 14:52.159
I'd never leave the house.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.327
I have a job for you.
- And I've told you, no.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.263
- You didn't even ask
what it is.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.131
- I'm happy at the FBI.

14:58.165 --> 15:02.269
- Really, you're happy
filing papers at the OPM?

15:02.302 --> 15:05.005
You do realize, they won't ever
let you in the field again?

15:05.038 --> 15:07.140
- I can get out anywhere here.

15:07.174 --> 15:10.010
- You're radioactive, Nadine.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.245
The FBI doesn't like heroes.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.547
They want bureaucrats.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.117
It's in the name,
for Christ's sake.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.356
- Okay, what's the job,
the one you're offering?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.025
- I can't tell you
unless you say--

15:25.058 --> 15:26.159
- Seriously, I can get out
anywhere here.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.295
- Okay, I will tell you this.

15:28.328 --> 15:31.965
The people who work for me
affect real change,

15:31.999 --> 15:35.735
and we don't have to color
inside the lines.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.471
You can stay at the FBI.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.407
I'll just have you transferred.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.242
[tense music]

15:42.275 --> 15:43.243
- To do what?

15:43.276 --> 15:45.378
*

15:45.412 --> 15:47.547
- One step at a time.

15:47.580 --> 15:53.020
Just think about it, my dear,
but not for too long.

15:53.053 --> 15:57.357
*

15:59.459 --> 16:01.428
- Looks fine.

16:01.461 --> 16:03.463
- Ah, I should iron it
just a little.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.232
- Come on, Jules. It's the guys.
They don't care.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.566
- It's the guys and their wives,

16:06.599 --> 16:08.268
and wives care about
those kind of things.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.203
Come on.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.972
- I think you're just trying
to get me out of my clothes.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.344
- I mean, we are
in a hotel room alone.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.050

[gasps]

16:26.619 --> 16:29.989
[overlapping indistinct chatter]

16:31.824 --> 16:33.393
- We do not have to hear
this story again.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.162
- Yes, yes, we do.
- Yes, we do.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.030
- No, it's not a reunion

16:37.064 --> 16:38.598
unless somebody
tells the story, right?

16:38.631 --> 16:40.367
- Exactly.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.035
- Someone tell
the goddamn story, please.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.403
- It's Dobbs. Gotta be Dobbs.
- Dobbs.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.172
- Tell the story.
- Dobbs! Dobbs!

16:45.205 --> 16:46.306
- Please don't.
- Please, Dobbs.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.374
- Do it.
- Babe, no.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.475
- Okay.
- Yeah!

16:48.508 --> 16:49.609
- No.
[laughter]

16:49.642 --> 16:51.344
- He used to make this big batch

16:51.378 --> 16:53.613
of chicken enchiladas, and--

16:53.646 --> 16:56.049
- Wait, wait, wait.
With Afghani chicken,

16:56.083 --> 16:57.417
which is technically pigeon.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.386
- Oh!
- But he did not care.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.254
He didn't care.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.489
He would have three of those
things ten minutes

17:02.522 --> 17:04.257
before we went
outside the wire.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.592
- At least.
- And you could always tell

17:05.625 --> 17:08.528
when the shit was about
to fly...

17:08.561 --> 17:09.529
when Zehnder shit.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.637

gonna believe this.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.173
- You have got
to be kidding me.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.574
- I saw you go before we left.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.543
- I have
an active metabolism.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.413
- I told you
to take Imodium.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.549
- Guys, we're on the job.
Zehnder, go in your pants.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.484
- That's a big negative, Nailer.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.153
- Well, I don't think
this pile of rocks

17:33.186 --> 17:34.554
has any indoor plumbing,

17:34.587 --> 17:37.590
so you're shit out of luck.
- Literally.

17:37.624 --> 17:39.592
- This place is deserted.
I'm going.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.495
- Deserted don't mean safe.
Wait till we clear it.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.531
- I'm about to clear it.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.234
- Will somebody tell me what
the hell is going on out there?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.535
- Zehnder needs the head.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.103
- Does he know
he's on a mission?

17:50.137 --> 17:51.671
- The doors are locked.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.073
Who abandons their house
and locks the doors?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.349
Ahh!

18:06.353 --> 18:08.121
- Three Talis

- Zehnder.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.140
I really miss that guy.

18:27.174 --> 18:30.277

Miguel Fernandez,

Always forward!

- Oorah!

18:40.553 --> 18:44.391
- Thank God for Zehnder's
weak constitution

18:44.424 --> 18:45.758
or else somebody'd
be toasting us right now.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.594
- Could be.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.697
- Unh-uh, not with Bob
the Nailer on overwatch.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.665

- Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.235
This is the most famous sniper
in the world.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.603

18:56.636 --> 18:59.406
- So much for being
invisible, buddy.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.741
- Too bad Captain Johnson
couldn't be here.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.378
Y'all still keep in touch?
Y'all used to be pretty tight.

19:05.412 --> 19:10.517

since I rotated out.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.897

22:44.931 --> 22:47.767
Thank you.
Thank you.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.571
[audience applause]

*

22:57.043 --> 22:59.712
[people screaming]

22:59.746 --> 23:02.081
That was a rifle
inside the hotel.

23:02.114 --> 23:09.088
*

23:09.121 --> 23:11.791
[gunfire and screaming]

23:11.824 --> 23:18.831

23:24.036 --> 23:26.105
- [screams]
- Stay down, stay down!

23:31.878 --> 23:33.846
- [screaming]

23:33.880 --> 23:34.881
- Stay down!

23:34.914 --> 23:38.718
*

23:38.751 --> 23:40.019
- I'm gonna check the doors!

23:40.052 --> 23:41.654
[gunshot]
- No!

23:41.688 --> 23:44.857
*

23:44.891 --> 23:46.726
- It's time to move!
Time to move!

23:46.759 --> 23:48.094
- Is there a back door?
- Stay low. Yes, that way!

23:48.127 --> 23:50.129
- Follow me, follow me!

23:50.162 --> 23:51.564
- Come on, follow me, follow me!
- Let's go! Let's go! Stay low!

23:51.598 --> 23:54.100
- Tio!
[whistles]

[mouthing silently]

23:55.935 --> 24:02.942
*

24:04.944 --> 24:06.913
- [gasps and gurgles]

24:08.548 --> 24:10.650
- They're all wired!

24:10.683 --> 24:17.657
*

24:17.690 --> 24:18.991
- I can't feel my legs.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.993
- It's adrenaline.
Keep breathing.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.629
- I've never been this scared.
- Look, you got this, okay?

24:22.662 --> 24:23.896
One step at a time.
Come on, follow me.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.832
Keep your heads low,
all right?

24:25.865 --> 24:27.634
When we hit the street,
you turn right and you run.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.001
- Run where?
- Where they're not shooting.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.637
- Julie, you guys get low
and don't stand

24:30.670 --> 24:31.771
until I give you the sign,
copy?

24:31.804 --> 24:33.139
- Got it!
- Tio, take left!

24:33.172 --> 24:34.574
- Copy!
- I'm gonna clear the lobby!

24:34.607 --> 24:38.010
[tense music]

24:38.044 --> 24:39.145
There's one more.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.915
*

24:42.949 --> 24:45.184
Only way I'm getting a clear
shot is if I'm in the lobby.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.819
In case he lives,
you pull the doors.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.187
They're wood,
but they're thick.

24:48.220 --> 24:50.657
- That means you're on
the wrong side.

24:50.690 --> 24:57.697
*

25:11.010 --> 25:12.912
- What are you doing?
[gasps]

25:12.945 --> 25:19.952
*

25:24.190 --> 25:25.692
- Kevin!

25:25.725 --> 25:28.027
[gunshots]

25:28.060 --> 25:29.095
Aah!

25:29.128 --> 25:33.866
*

25:39.005 --> 25:39.138
.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.875
[sirens wailing]

25:45.011 --> 25:47.113
- Hey.
- How are you?

25:48.881 --> 25:50.783
- Got the girls
all squared away.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.351
We're just gonna take turns
with Kevin's girlfriend

25:52.384 --> 25:54.954
'cause she's in
pretty bad shape.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.256
- Yeah, but how are you?

25:57.289 --> 25:59.291
- Messed up.
I mean, I know

25:59.325 --> 26:01.961
that this is normal for you.
This isn't normal for me.

26:01.994 --> 26:04.230
- Sweetheart, this isn't
normal for anyone.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.905
Guy must have helped
over a thousand vets.

26:12.939 --> 26:16.275
He literally got them
back on their feet.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.010
He deserved better.

26:18.044 --> 26:20.212
- We've ID'd the shooters.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.914
- Turkish.
They're running them now.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.282
Chances are it's gonna
come up empty.

26:23.315 --> 26:25.151
- What do you mean, "empty"?

26:25.184 --> 26:27.053
- These assholes work
in small cells,

26:27.086 --> 26:29.188
very compartmentalized.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.891
I'm sure
ISIS will claim credit.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.292
- How's Rodriguez?
- Lucky, I guess.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.161
Clipped his shoulder.
They're taking him

26:35.194 --> 26:37.296
to the hospital now.
He should be out in a few hours.

26:37.329 --> 26:40.332
- When can we get home?
Look, I want to see my daughter.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.301
- As soon as the airport's open,
we'll get you guys out of here.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.236
- Okay, when is that gonna be?
I mean,

26:44.270 --> 26:46.072
I don't really want
to be trapped here.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.974
- Thank you, Tio.
We can talk about it outside.

26:50.943 --> 26:52.311
- Look, I'm sorry.
I just--

26:52.344 --> 26:54.180
I don't want to feel like
I'm trapped here.

26:54.213 --> 26:55.414
I want to go home.
- I get it, I get it, sweetie.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.417
Just listen to me.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.987
That was bad, and nothing's

27:01.020 --> 27:03.956
gonna prepare you for it.
- Yeah.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.926
- But we lived, and we're gonna
see Mary again.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.928
You got to hang on to that,
baby, 'cause

27:08.961 --> 27:10.863
every shit situation I've ever
been in, the only thing

27:10.897 --> 27:14.000
that kept me going was what
I had to be grateful for.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.202
We survived.

27:16.235 --> 27:19.205
[pensive music]

27:19.238 --> 27:26.045
*

27:26.078 --> 27:27.980
- What happens to him now?

27:28.014 --> 27:30.449
- He gets sent home
under a flag.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.119
- Alone?
- Yeah.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.854
That doesn't seem right.

27:34.887 --> 27:38.190
- I hate leaving him here.

27:38.224 --> 27:40.226
- Look, I'll fly home
as soon as I can, okay?

27:40.259 --> 27:43.996
You fly home with Kevin, just
see if Dobbs can go with you.

27:44.030 --> 27:47.166
- I think that'd be a good idea.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.869
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

27:54.140 --> 27:57.109
[tense music]

27:57.143 --> 28:04.016
*

28:13.525 --> 28:15.327
- Babe.
- Yeah, yeah?

28:15.361 --> 28:17.730
- [speaking Mandarin]

28:17.764 --> 28:21.400
- Go?
Go?

28:21.433 --> 28:25.071
Go--go where?
- Away from here.

28:25.104 --> 28:28.107
- What?
What are you talking about?

28:28.140 --> 28:30.142
*

28:30.176 --> 28:33.012
- They're cleaning up.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.015
It's not safe
for us here anymore.

28:36.048 --> 28:39.051
[sirens wailing]

28:43.122 --> 28:46.092
[tense music]

28:46.125 --> 28:53.099
*

28:53.132 --> 28:57.970
- Man, this place is a big,
sloppy, wet shit show.

28:58.004 --> 28:59.338
What you got, Gunny?

28:59.371 --> 29:02.474
- I got an itch.
- Well, let's scratch it.

29:02.508 --> 29:04.076
- Where's your lady?

29:04.110 --> 29:05.544
- Man, they went back
to the hotel,

29:05.577 --> 29:08.114
and Tio's up to her ass
in RSO paperwork.

29:08.147 --> 29:10.382
She's gonna be here
for the next several hours.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.952
Ali, his lady ain't doing
so good, so he went with her.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.453
If it wasn't for the beer,
Germany would blow.

29:14.486 --> 29:18.324
- Colin, I saw a shooter.
A long gun.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.426
He hit Kevin, and then hit
the vest to cover it.

29:20.459 --> 29:23.295
- That's not usually their MO.
These guys usually just go boom.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.397
- Well, then how'd that last
asshole detonate the vest?

29:25.431 --> 29:27.199
I shot him right through
the brainstem.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.068
- Brother, I want payback
just as much as you do,

29:29.101 --> 29:31.804
but even if there was a shooter,
how are we gonna find him?

29:31.838 --> 29:33.806
- Kevin was on the floor.
[glass shatters]

29:33.840 --> 29:35.374
I saw the glass break
before he went down.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.276
Based on the height
of that window,

29:37.309 --> 29:39.078
the shot had to come
from down that street.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.047
- There's got to be
20 possibilities.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.481
- Look at this.

29:42.514 --> 29:44.984
I took this
right after the attack.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.055
See anything?

29:49.088 --> 29:52.058
- Top floor--no window, no
curtains, and now they're back.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.360
- Trajectory's right.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.228
- He ain't gonna be there.

29:56.262 --> 29:58.364
- Yeah, but he might
have left something behind.

29:58.397 --> 30:01.433
Let's go.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.280
Danke.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.167
This is it.

30:36.903 --> 30:38.837
- Whatever it is,
it's creepy.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.047
- There's paint chips.

30:54.586 --> 30:58.190
Yeah, he was here.
He hung a screen.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.326
So, 200-plus meters.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.162
Suppressed rifle.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.630
This guy was the backup.

31:04.663 --> 31:07.066
- I don't know, man.
Tiny holes and paint chips

31:07.099 --> 31:08.534
ain't exactly a smoking gun.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.103
- Yeah.

31:13.405 --> 31:20.412
*

31:21.547 --> 31:23.315
- Oh, God damn it.

31:23.349 --> 31:25.317
- She must have surprised him.

31:25.351 --> 31:29.655
*

31:29.688 --> 31:31.657
It's gonna take the police

31:31.690 --> 31:33.926
ten seconds to figure out
this wasn't a suicide.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.595
- Let's not be here
when they do.

31:36.628 --> 31:42.468
*

31:42.501 --> 31:45.571
[gunfire echoing]

31:45.604 --> 31:52.611
*

31:54.646 --> 31:56.148
- Underneath the bed,
all right?

31:56.182 --> 31:57.549
- I'm scared.
- Come on.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.351
You can't come out
until Mommy comes back

31:59.385 --> 32:00.452
for you, okay?
Promise me.

32:00.486 --> 32:01.453
- Promise.

32:01.487 --> 32:04.323
*

32:04.356 --> 32:06.458
- [gasps]

32:06.492 --> 32:09.495
[phone rings]

32:12.698 --> 32:14.633
Yes?
- Mrs. Swagger,

32:14.666 --> 32:16.568
I am sorry to report
the airport is still closed.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.370
No flights are available.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.972
- Okay, when is it gonna
open back up?

32:20.006 --> 32:21.640
- They do not know.

32:21.673 --> 32:28.680
*

32:42.428 --> 32:46.532
- Why am I approving
air transport from Frankfurt?

32:46.565 --> 32:48.300
Is this tied
to the terrorist attack?

32:48.334 --> 32:50.302
- Yes, ma'am. I have friends
who are over there.

32:50.336 --> 32:52.571
They need to get home.
- What friends?

32:54.606 --> 32:58.244
- Julie Swagger, ma'am.
- Absolutely not.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.012
- Ma'am, if I can explain--
- Let me explain.

33:00.046 --> 33:02.548
Howard Utey was tracking
to be the director one day.

33:02.581 --> 33:04.250
Now he'll be lucky
if he ever gets an office

33:04.283 --> 33:05.751
with windows again.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.619
I didn't have a choice
with you, Memphis.

33:07.653 --> 33:11.257
You had to go somewhere,
and I drew the short straw.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.759
- Hey!
I did my job.

33:13.792 --> 33:16.562
- You got lucky,
starting with Bob Lee Swagger

33:16.595 --> 33:19.265
landing on a car
right in front of you.

33:19.298 --> 33:20.366
Get back to your paperwork.

33:24.403 --> 33:27.239
- Let's pick up some supplies
and get on the move.

33:27.273 --> 33:28.540
- You okay?
- Yeah.

33:28.574 --> 33:33.312
- You sure?
You just seem a little--

33:33.345 --> 33:35.481
- Run!

33:35.514 --> 33:38.450
Stay down, stay down.
[gunfire]

33:38.484 --> 33:41.620
[dramatic music]

33:41.653 --> 33:43.222
Go, go!

33:43.255 --> 33:46.725
*

33:46.758 --> 33:48.294
You okay?
- Yeah.

33:48.327 --> 33:49.595
- Keep your head down low.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.730
[people screaming]

33:51.763 --> 33:53.565
Head down, go!

33:53.599 --> 33:55.834
*

33:55.867 --> 33:57.769
Run.

33:57.803 --> 34:04.810
*

34:07.613 --> 34:14.620
*

34:16.122 --> 34:17.656
- I don't know, a belt?
- Make a tourniquet.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.625
- I can't feel it.
- That's the shock.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.493
I'm gonna get you
someplace safe.

34:21.527 --> 34:24.463
- Okay.
[groans]

34:24.496 --> 34:27.433
- All right, come on.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

34:27.466 --> 34:30.636
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

34:30.669 --> 34:35.674
- [Lin groaning]

34:48.154 --> 34:52.658
- Gonna tighten it.
- [shouts and groans]

34:52.691 --> 34:54.693
- You need a doctor.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.564
[speaking Mandarin]

34:58.597 --> 35:00.699
- I'll find someone
who can help you.

35:00.732 --> 35:03.802
- I'll survive this.
I promise.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.738
Let's just get some place safe,
give me a day or two of rest,

35:06.772 --> 35:08.807
and then I'll be good as new,
okay?

35:08.840 --> 35:12.844
All right?

35:12.878 --> 35:15.614
- [speaking Mandarin]

35:15.647 --> 35:16.915
- Don't forget it.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.551
Look, we got to go.

35:28.160 --> 35:28.327
.

35:28.360 --> 35:31.297
[phone rings]

35:34.800 --> 35:36.735
- Memphis.

35:36.768 --> 35:38.904
- I hear you need
a better travel agent.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.439
- Jesus, how could you
possibly know that?

35:40.472 --> 35:42.208
Are you bugging my office?

35:42.241 --> 35:44.243
- Your office is
too boring to bug.

35:44.276 --> 35:47.179
What would I learn, how
your solitaire game is going?

35:47.213 --> 35:49.915
Meet me at the Hay-Adams
in 20 minutes.

36:00.559 --> 36:03.429
- You don't have an office?
- Take a seat.

36:07.499 --> 36:10.802
I can have Julie Swagger
in the air in 90 minutes.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.338
Email these to her.

36:12.371 --> 36:14.540
Tell her to bring them
to Ramstein.

36:14.573 --> 36:18.777
There's a C-17 fueling up.
It'll be waiting for her.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.449
- u doing this out
of the kindness of your heart,

36:23.482 --> 36:25.284
or is this you trying
to get me to work for you?

36:25.317 --> 36:28.420
- Those two things are not
mutually exclusive.

36:28.454 --> 36:30.922
They're never gonna let you
out of that office, Nadine.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.824
You must know that by now.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.928
- I did everything right.

36:36.962 --> 36:41.400
- They don't care.

36:41.433 --> 36:44.202
But I do.

36:46.472 --> 36:48.340
- You really think
some fanatic on a long gun's

36:48.374 --> 36:50.609
gonna take the time to clean up?
Look around here.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.344
They don't give a shit
about bodies or evidence.

36:52.378 --> 36:54.012
- I can't deal
with your bullshit, Swagger.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.414
This is the second time
they called me

36:55.447 --> 36:56.882
down here for questioning.

36:56.915 --> 36:59.251
You're not in charge,
you're not a cop,

36:59.285 --> 37:01.653
and what the hell
are you doing anyway?

37:01.687 --> 37:03.455
You have any idea
how deep this shit

37:03.489 --> 37:04.990
would be if they
caught you there?

37:05.023 --> 37:06.292
- Those assholes killed Kevin.

37:06.325 --> 37:07.526
- And we killed them.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.862
It sucks...
- Staff Sergeant.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.999
- Okay?
But it's over.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.567
What's up?
- [scoffs]

37:17.369 --> 37:20.406
- Give her a break, man.
- Kevin was killed by a sniper

37:20.439 --> 37:22.974
who detonated the vest
to cover it up.

37:23.008 --> 37:26.278
- From the BKA--they found it
on one of the attackers.

37:26.312 --> 37:28.013
You were right
about one thing,

37:28.046 --> 37:32.518
a bunch of terrorists
looking to kill some Marines.

37:32.551 --> 37:37.323
- Not some Marines.
They were after us.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.358
- Why?

37:39.391 --> 37:41.560
- I have no idea, but we better
stick together until we do.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.696
[phone buzzes]

37:44.730 --> 37:47.065
Hey, where are you?
- Well, our flights

37:47.098 --> 37:49.535
were all messed up, so I called
our guardian angel.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.403
- Memphis?
- Yeah.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.339
She somehow got us
a military transport,

37:53.372 --> 37:56.007
so we're headed there right now
and Yusuf is with us.

37:56.041 --> 37:58.043
Do you have any idea
when you're coming home?

37:58.076 --> 38:01.012
- Dobbs and I are gonna go check
on Rodriguez at the hospital.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.514
Hopefully we're on
a plane tomorrow.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.049
- What about Kevin?

38:04.082 --> 38:05.651
- Not leaving without him.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.387
- Well, hurry home, okay?
We need you.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.689
- I promise I will, baby.
Love you.

38:10.722 --> 38:11.890
- Love you too.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.466
- Sprechen sie American?

38:20.499 --> 38:22.734
What's your deal?

38:22.768 --> 38:25.471
- They're moving you.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.906
- Really?

38:27.939 --> 38:29.908
Your place?

38:29.941 --> 38:31.910
- No, Landstuhl.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.713
- [groans]

38:34.746 --> 38:37.583
- Transfer just came.

38:39.451 --> 38:42.454
[indistinct radio chatter]

38:58.504 --> 39:02.774
- Hey, you sure you know
where you're going?

39:02.808 --> 39:04.743
- Sehr gut, ja.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.078
- [chuckles]
"Sehr gut, ja."

39:07.112 --> 39:09.014
- Yeah.

39:09.047 --> 39:11.683
[tense music]

39:11.717 --> 39:18.724
*

39:22.193 --> 39:24.963
- [gasps and screams]

39:24.996 --> 39:27.699
[grunting]

39:27.733 --> 39:34.740
*

39:48.587 --> 39:53.091
- It's a new driver, yeah?
Danke.

39:53.124 --> 39:54.993
- His phone's going
straight to voicemail.

39:55.026 --> 39:57.028
- Yeah, the hospital says
a transfer order came in.

39:57.062 --> 39:58.830
New driver.
Had all the proper I.D.

39:58.864 --> 40:02.534
They can't reach him either.
- Son of a bitch.

40:02.568 --> 40:04.169
- We got to call Tio
and tell her we need her now.

40:04.202 --> 40:05.804
- We don't have
any authority here, Swagger.

40:05.837 --> 40:09.641
- We don't need authority.
We need information.

40:09.675 --> 40:16.682
*

41:07.666 --> 41:09.067
- Hey.

41:09.100 --> 41:12.638
Well, whoever this is,
he's good.

41:12.671 --> 41:15.607
Hospital security
sent this to the police.

41:15.641 --> 41:17.643
He never showed his face.

41:17.676 --> 41:19.711
- That's him.
- Jesus.

41:19.745 --> 41:23.081
- No denying it now.
- This wasn't terrorism.

41:23.114 --> 41:25.784
It was murder.

41:25.817 --> 41:29.254
We're being hunted.
