01:19.630 --> 01:22.895
<i>Failure is one
of life's few absolutes.</i>

01:22.967 --> 01:25.527
<i>Success, on the other hand,
is relative.</i>

01:25.603 --> 01:28.800
<i>For instance, there's the story of
a guy who spent his entire childhood</i>

01:28.873 --> 01:31.034
<i>dreaming of
becoming a fighter pilot.</i>

01:31.108 --> 01:34.305
<i>He joined up at 18, came out of
flight school number one in his class,</i>

01:34.378 --> 01:37.643
<i>soloed like a pro, and was
assigned to a top combat wing.</i>

01:42.820 --> 01:45.311
<i>A week before he was
to fly his first mission</i>

01:45.923 --> 01:47.857
<i>there was a fire
in his barracks.</i>

01:47.925 --> 01:49.392
<i>He pulled two
guys from the flames,</i>

01:49.460 --> 01:52.429
<i>and suffered third-degree burns
to his hands in the process.</i>

01:52.630 --> 01:55.690
<i>He was a hero
and he wound up a general.</i>

02:00.638 --> 02:02.697
<i>But he was never
able to fly again.</i>

02:06.544 --> 02:09.308
<i>Relative success
and absolute failure.</i>

02:10.014 --> 02:11.504
<i>Hey, Thomas.</i>

02:11.949 --> 02:13.075
What?

02:13.451 --> 02:15.578
<i>Hi, Rick.
You want something?</i>

02:16.220 --> 02:17.585
What happened to your hair?

02:17.655 --> 02:21.614
<i>I got a haircut. I thought it would
look a little more, I don't know, mature.</i>

02:21.692 --> 02:23.125
It looks weird.

02:23.194 --> 02:25.788
<i>Well, that's what I was
going for. Mature or weird.</i>

02:25.930 --> 02:28.455
<i>Oh. Hey, look, I don't want
to be the bearer of bad news,</i>

02:28.532 --> 02:31.092
but the accountant called
about your tab again today.

02:31.736 --> 02:33.101
I'll pay the whole thing.

02:33.237 --> 02:35.501
<i>Well, why don't you come up with
the usual? Just a few bucks and...</i>

02:35.573 --> 02:37.768
I said I'd pay the entire tab.

02:37.842 --> 02:40.174
<i>Okay, okay. What are you
getting so upset about?</i>

02:40.244 --> 02:43.270
Upset? I'm not upset. I said I'd
come up with the money. No problem.

02:43.347 --> 02:45.281
Amend that to slight problem.

02:45.349 --> 02:48.216
Pan Pacific Shipping called me
since they couldn't find you.

02:48.286 --> 02:49.776
They wanted to
verify your address

02:49.854 --> 02:52.914
<i>to send you your final
expense check, but no fee.</i>

02:53.991 --> 02:55.219
Right. No fee.

02:55.626 --> 02:56.615
You were fired?

02:56.961 --> 02:58.428
I decided to drop the case.

02:58.496 --> 02:59.485
You were fired.

02:59.864 --> 03:02.662
Which is why I decided to drop
the case. These things happen.

03:02.733 --> 03:03.995
No big deal.

03:04.068 --> 03:07.868
<i>Yes, I guess by now you must be
getting used to being dismissed.</i>

03:08.472 --> 03:11.066
<i>Look, Thomas, don't worry
about your little problem.</i>

03:11.142 --> 03:12.131
I'll cover for you.

03:12.343 --> 03:15.039
I said I would take care
of that little problem.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.410
What little problem? And
why are you getting so upset?

03:17.481 --> 03:18.505
I'm not upset.

03:18.582 --> 03:20.277
Then why aren't you answering
the phone or the door?

03:20.351 --> 03:23.115
Because I wanted a little time
by myself. Is that a crime?

03:23.187 --> 03:25.348
<i>No, but your morning mail
is mildly criminal.</i>

03:25.423 --> 03:27.186
Two letters marked
"Final Notice."

03:27.258 --> 03:31.024
<i>Well, thanks, Higgins, but I don't need
you to pick up my mail. I'll get my own.</i>

03:31.095 --> 03:32.653
<i>Yes, along with
the estate's mail,</i>

03:32.730 --> 03:35.164
which you invariably
forget to give me for days.

03:35.232 --> 03:37.792
<i>No, I'd rather be responsible
for collecting the mail myself.</i>

03:37.868 --> 03:39.460
<i>Well, then leave mine
in the box.</i>

03:39.537 --> 03:42.506
<i>And, Rick, don't cover for me.
I'll take care of the tab.</i>

03:42.573 --> 03:45.474
<i>I don't need a mail delivery
service, and I don't need cover.</i>

03:49.280 --> 03:50.508
Cover.

04:34.992 --> 04:36.687
What happened to your hair?

04:36.761 --> 04:39.730
<i>Oh, this. I'm just trying
something new. How's the back, T. C?</i>

04:39.797 --> 04:40.991
Better.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.325
How did Pop Warner practice go today? Great.

04:47.238 --> 04:50.401
Great? Practice went great?

04:50.674 --> 04:52.403
Why wouldn't it go great?

04:55.079 --> 04:56.808
You weren't there.

04:57.915 --> 04:59.473
<i>Well, not exactly.</i>

04:59.550 --> 05:01.484
I knew you wouldn't...
But I can explain.

05:01.552 --> 05:02.644
<i>Oh, you can always explain.</i>

05:02.720 --> 05:05.883
<i>No, I was just about to leave for the park,
I got this real important phone call...</i>

05:05.956 --> 05:07.548
I knew it was a good idea

05:07.625 --> 05:10.093
<i>to call Jerry Watkins,
just in case. By the time...</i>

05:11.629 --> 05:12.926
Jerry Watkins?

05:12.997 --> 05:16.296
<i>Yeah, he never has to
explain. He always shows up.</i>

05:17.001 --> 05:18.559
You called in a backup?

05:20.137 --> 05:22.867
You couldn't trust me enough?
You called in a backup?

05:23.441 --> 05:24.840
Were you there?

05:25.976 --> 05:28.672
That's not the point.
That's always the point!

05:36.620 --> 05:39.521
<i>Hey, I'm not through yelling
at you. Where you going?</i>

05:39.590 --> 05:41.387
<i>Virginia, to see my mom.</i>

05:45.663 --> 05:48.996
<i>I did want to go to Virginia.
I liked going back.</i>

05:49.066 --> 05:51.557
<i>And it would have
been nice seeing my mom.</i>

05:51.635 --> 05:55.662
<i>But for some reason, there
was someplace else I had to go.</i>

05:56.440 --> 05:59.341
<i>It was a beautiful place, on
a remote part of the island,</i>

05:59.477 --> 06:03.072
<i>but it wasn't the place itself
that I knew I had to see.</i>

06:05.616 --> 06:09.177
<i>I'd remembered seeing it once
when T.C. And I had flown over it.</i>

06:09.253 --> 06:10.845
<i>It had really
caught me at the moment,</i>

06:10.921 --> 06:14.288
<i>but then I'd forgotten about it until lately.</i>

06:14.925 --> 06:18.156
<i>Lately it had been on my mind more and more.</i>

06:18.262 --> 06:19.991
<i>I'm not exactly sure why,</i>

06:20.464 --> 06:22.659
<i>or why I felt the need
to go there today</i>

06:22.733 --> 06:25.668
<i>instead of getting on a
plane and going to Virginia.</i>

06:30.808 --> 06:33.743
<i>Climbing this mountain was
certainly cheaper than flying home.</i>

06:33.811 --> 06:36.075
<i>And besides, the way things
had been going lately,</i>

06:36.147 --> 06:40.379
<i>I knew I'd probably get stuck with the
middle seat for the entire 11-hour flight.</i>

06:44.221 --> 06:48.715
<i>But the main reason had nothing
to do with money or middle seats.</i>

06:48.826 --> 06:50.589
<i>I guess it had to
do with the need</i>

06:50.661 --> 06:54.461
<i>to get to the top of this
mountain, even if I wasn't sure why.</i>

06:55.332 --> 06:57.994
<i>You don't seem to be sure
of anything, Mr. Magnum.</i>

06:58.068 --> 07:00.298
<i>You have no suspects,
you have no leads.</i>

07:01.605 --> 07:04.165
You didn't even get the
haircut I told you to get.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.276
You said you'd have
everything taken care of

07:07.344 --> 07:08.902
by the time I
came back from Europe.

07:10.714 --> 07:14.013
<i>Look, I don't like
to fire people,</i>

07:14.885 --> 07:18.878
<i>but unless you come up with
something by tomorrow, you're out.</i>

07:23.961 --> 07:25.485
Mr. Magnum?

07:28.732 --> 07:29.892
Mr. Magnum.

07:35.506 --> 07:38.566
<i>That's it, I've had it.
You're fired.</i>

07:39.176 --> 07:40.507
Great.

07:41.111 --> 07:42.840
<i>Totally incompetent!</i>

07:42.913 --> 07:44.073
Damn!

07:44.448 --> 07:46.848
<i>I know what you're thinking.
And you're right.</i>

07:46.917 --> 07:48.748
<i>It wasn't worth going on.</i>

07:48.819 --> 07:51.253
<i>I knew that centipede bites
didn't generally kill you,</i>

07:51.322 --> 07:54.382
<i>but on the other hand, I heard you
could get pretty sick from them.</i>

07:54.458 --> 07:57.291
<i>And it didn't make any sense
not to get my neck looked at.</i>

07:58.562 --> 08:01.190
<i>Besides, with the loose
rocks and difficult terrain,</i>

08:01.265 --> 08:03.096
<i>I knew I had to
have all my wits about me</i>

08:03.167 --> 08:05.226
<i>to even get
to the top of the mountain.</i>

08:05.603 --> 08:09.767
<i>And I had to believe that what
was up there wasn't going anywhere,</i>

08:10.274 --> 08:12.708
<i>and that maybe instead</i>

08:12.776 --> 08:15.472
<i>I should just hope for
an aisle seat to Virginia.</i>

08:15.546 --> 08:17.946
<i>I could always climb
this mountain another day.</i>

08:20.417 --> 08:22.977
<i>Keep going, keep going.</i>

08:23.587 --> 08:27.148
<i>Dad, I can't do it!
I wanna stop.</i>

08:29.760 --> 08:30.988
Come on.

08:32.395 --> 08:34.796
Twenty seconds away
from a new record.

08:35.065 --> 08:36.395
I'm tired.

08:36.567 --> 08:39.092
<i>You can do it, Tommy,
you can do it. Keep going.</i>

08:39.203 --> 08:41.797
<i>You know, I'm sure you
could eventually, Mr. Magnum.</i>

08:42.239 --> 08:44.104
But how long would it take?

08:44.174 --> 08:46.472
<i>Six months? A year?</i>

08:52.082 --> 08:55.017
<i>Dad, are you gonna be in
Korea for a whole year?</i>

08:55.352 --> 08:58.879
<i>Well, you don't know how long
you'll be gone in a war, son.</i>

08:58.956 --> 09:01.390
<i>Don't worry,
I'll take good care of Mom.</i>

09:05.496 --> 09:07.726
<i>Mom sure does cry a lot lately.</i>

09:07.831 --> 09:10.231
<i>Guess that's 'cause you're
going to Korea, huh?</i>

09:10.301 --> 09:12.997
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.</i>

09:13.337 --> 09:16.704
You guess so?
You're still not sure?

09:17.741 --> 09:20.437
<i>Mr. Magnum,
when can I expect results?</i>

09:37.294 --> 09:38.921
<i>It won't be long now.</i>

09:38.996 --> 09:41.794
<i>Scuttlebutt has it that the
Princeton's gonna relieve us,</i>

09:41.865 --> 09:43.594
<i>and we'll be home by the 4th.</i>

09:44.702 --> 09:45.999
<i>I hope so,</i>

09:46.070 --> 09:49.403
<i>'cause I don't know if I can wait
till then, I miss you two so much.</i>

09:51.075 --> 09:53.270
<i>Sometimes,
coming back from a mission,</i>

09:53.344 --> 09:56.802
<i>I'm tempted to just keep
flying until I reach San Diego.</i>

09:56.914 --> 09:59.348
<i>Don't, Dad.
You'll run out of gas.</i>

09:59.650 --> 10:03.347
<i>Well, there's only a little
tape left, so I better sign off.</i>

10:04.321 --> 10:05.515
<i>I love...</i>

10:08.425 --> 10:09.824
<i>Don't cry, Mom.</i>

10:11.729 --> 10:13.697
Dad said he'd be
home by the 4th.

10:48.866 --> 10:50.094
<i>Aim!</i>

10:51.702 --> 10:52.930
<i>Fire!</i>

10:53.137 --> 10:54.263
<i>Aim!</i>

10:55.072 --> 10:56.334
Fire!

10:56.573 --> 10:57.733
Aim!

10:58.208 --> 10:59.573
Fire!

10:59.877 --> 11:02.539
Order arms!

12:32.252 --> 12:34.186
<i>It was from a different war,</i>

12:34.254 --> 12:36.518
<i>a different age of aircraft.</i>

12:36.589 --> 12:39.490
<i>This P-40 and the Navy
Panther jet my dad flew</i>

12:39.559 --> 12:42.255
<i>had little in common
as combat machinery.</i>

12:42.328 --> 12:45.388
<i>But the pilots who
manned them weren't machines.</i>

12:45.898 --> 12:48.059
<i>Looking down on
Pearl or on Korea,</i>

12:48.134 --> 12:51.331
<i>they probably shared in common
a dream of finally going home,</i>

12:52.205 --> 12:54.696
<i>and may also have
shared in common</i>

12:54.774 --> 12:57.607
<i>a moment when they
knew they weren't going to.</i>

12:58.111 --> 13:00.636
<i>I guess that was my main
reason for coming up here.</i>

13:02.148 --> 13:04.116
<i>The plane had
obviously been shot down.</i>

13:04.183 --> 13:06.481
<i>Probably during
the Pearl Harbor attack.</i>

13:07.020 --> 13:08.920
<i>Had the pilot survived?</i>

13:09.022 --> 13:10.546
<i>Had he been found and rescued?</i>

13:10.623 --> 13:13.990
<i>Had he died in the cockpit, or
trying to get off the mountain?</i>

13:14.527 --> 13:16.017
<i>I didn't know.</i>

13:16.663 --> 13:19.223
<i>But maybe
figuring out the answer</i>

13:19.299 --> 13:21.028
<i>would help resolve
some questions</i>

13:21.100 --> 13:23.591
<i>that I'd never wanted
to ask about another pilot,</i>

13:24.003 --> 13:25.766
<i>and a summer day in Korea.</i>

13:28.708 --> 13:31.268
<i>I know you're trying to
solve the case, Mr. Magnum.</i>

13:31.344 --> 13:33.471
<i>I mean,
I'm not sorry I hired you.</i>

13:33.546 --> 13:36.037
<i>But it's been ten days,</i>

13:36.382 --> 13:40.079
<i>and, well, I need some
sort of progress report.</i>

13:40.286 --> 13:43.414
<i>Something, anything, to get
Mr. Albertson off my back.</i>

14:01.974 --> 14:03.703
Probably got him in the spine.

14:43.082 --> 14:46.347
<i>Pity you can't solve all your
cases that quickly, Mr. Magnum.</i>

14:46.886 --> 14:48.854
I'll be back from Europe
in three weeks.

14:48.921 --> 14:51.549
I'm giving you until then
to break the case.

14:52.191 --> 14:53.488
<i>Now, get out.</i>

14:56.729 --> 14:58.162
I said get out!

15:00.867 --> 15:04.667
Come on. Twenty seconds
away from a new record.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.068
An hour?

15:46.045 --> 15:47.603
I've been out for an hour?

16:12.505 --> 16:14.234
<i>Magnum, how could you?</i>

16:14.440 --> 16:18.103
<i>You could feel the plane was
shifting, and yet you just sat there.</i>

16:18.644 --> 16:19.804
Oh.

16:20.613 --> 16:25.050
<i>You're just jealous, Higgins. Never
once in your incredible stories</i>

16:25.651 --> 16:29.246
have you ever come up with
having a plane land on your legs.

16:48.674 --> 16:52.838
<i>I don't suppose you could
reach my gear, could you?</i>

16:53.579 --> 16:56.776
<i>See, I got my canteen,</i>

16:56.849 --> 16:59.647
<i>my lunch, my first aid kit.
I got everything I need.</i>

17:03.322 --> 17:05.017
Here's my legs.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.964
I didn't think so.
I'm talking to an airplane.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.469
<i>A lady on an airplane,</i>

17:23.843 --> 17:25.674
but essentially an airplane.

17:25.744 --> 17:28.976
<i>Which is one of the first
warning signs of a bent psyche.</i>

17:29.782 --> 17:31.079
What does that mean?

17:31.150 --> 17:33.015
Simply that there
are so-called professions

17:33.085 --> 17:34.609
that only 40-year-old
adolescents

17:34.687 --> 17:37.212
desperate to prove their
virility would practice.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.924
<i>Well, whatever I'm trying to prove,
at least I'm doing it in the present.</i>

17:44.397 --> 17:46.922
I'm not rehashing
all the mistakes of the past.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.175
<i>Stuck tight, too, huh?</i>

18:07.720 --> 18:11.019
Never mind.
We can deal with the problem.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.450
<i>Matter of fact, I'd like
to get myself out of this</i>

18:14.527 --> 18:16.825
before the guys get here.
I just need to...

18:17.096 --> 18:19.428
To rest a second.

18:21.233 --> 18:24.691
<i>Look, do you mind
a little advice?</i>

18:27.239 --> 18:28.763
Don't fight it.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.099
You just get stuck worse.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.943
Just try and relax
and take some deep breaths.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.614
Great.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.853
<i>Now,</i>

18:49.028 --> 18:52.054
<i>in your own time, pick a leg,</i>

18:52.832 --> 18:54.265
<i>any leg,</i>

18:56.535 --> 18:59.766
<i>And try to slowly,</i>

19:01.974 --> 19:03.339
gently

19:04.844 --> 19:06.106
move it only.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.503
<i>See, if you get one leg free,</i>

19:09.015 --> 19:12.473
that'll give you leverage
to pry loose the other one.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.316
Other three.

19:22.561 --> 19:23.755
<i>Oh, no.</i>

19:25.197 --> 19:26.391
Now what?

19:27.733 --> 19:28.961
Go back!

19:29.802 --> 19:32.293
Come on.
You don't want that fly.

19:32.705 --> 19:35.401
<i>If you knew where flies spent
their time, you wouldn't.</i>

19:42.014 --> 19:43.208
Go back!

19:52.124 --> 19:53.352
Got him!

19:55.327 --> 19:57.761
<i>Now, don't move.
Don't move, fly.</i>

19:57.997 --> 20:00.329
<i>Movement just
draws attention to yourself.</i>

20:00.399 --> 20:03.232
I got to do something. They're
gonna arrest me for embezzlement.

20:03.302 --> 20:04.929
Relax.
We'll think of something.

20:06.572 --> 20:09.541
<i>Now, what monster's out there?</i>

20:12.244 --> 20:14.144
The one with big eyes and teeth.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.044
<i>Oh, yeah, Herman.</i>

20:16.115 --> 20:18.379
Herman.
We'll call him Herman.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.682
<i>See, it's kind of like a
sequel. "The Return of Herman."</i>

20:22.321 --> 20:25.290
<i>I know it sounds ridiculous,
but it worked the last time.</i>

20:25.991 --> 20:28.186
<i>Of course, the last time,
Herman was a shark.</i>

20:29.795 --> 20:33.196
<i>Oh, no. No, no, no, no.</i>

20:35.434 --> 20:37.698
<i>I know what you're doing, Dad.</i>

20:37.770 --> 20:39.670
<i>Look, you helped me
out the last time,</i>

20:39.739 --> 20:43.106
<i>and I appreciate it, but I got
to get out of this one myself.</i>

20:44.877 --> 20:46.037
Okay?

20:48.914 --> 20:50.677
<i>Of course,
when an idea is a good one,</i>

20:50.750 --> 20:52.513
what difference does it
make where it comes from?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.917
But this is the last time

20:54.987 --> 20:57.615
<i>I'm gonna let you bail
me out, Dad. I mean it.</i>

21:01.761 --> 21:04.662
<i>Hey, Herman,
you wanna play a game?</i>

21:05.998 --> 21:07.260
I know.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.193
I'll bet you'd like
hide-and-seek.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.199
It's a great game.

21:15.074 --> 21:19.101
<i>I'm closing my eyes, Herman,
and I'm slowly counting to ten.</i>

21:22.014 --> 21:24.608
<i>And when I finish,
you better be gone.</i>

21:26.085 --> 21:27.143
<i>One,</i>

21:28.320 --> 21:29.514
<i>two,</i>

21:30.589 --> 21:31.886
three...

21:33.125 --> 21:34.353
<i>Four,</i>

21:36.228 --> 21:37.422
<i>five,</i>

21:39.064 --> 21:40.190
six...

21:42.134 --> 21:43.294
<i>Seven,</i>

21:44.003 --> 21:45.163
<i>eight,</i>

21:46.071 --> 21:47.231
<i>nine,</i>

21:49.041 --> 21:50.133
ten.

21:53.078 --> 21:54.545
<i>Thanks, Herm.</i>

21:55.214 --> 21:59.173
<i>Look, I know you're hungry, but I have
a responsibility to protect my client.</i>

21:59.251 --> 22:01.481
<i>Are you sure you're
at your best right now?</i>

22:01.554 --> 22:05.513
<i>Centipede venom can cause delirium, you know.</i>

22:05.691 --> 22:08.558
<i>I'm fine. And I'll find
your embezzler, Albertson.</i>

22:08.627 --> 22:11.221
<i>And I am not delirious,
and I'm not</i>

22:14.834 --> 22:15.926
hurting.

22:19.471 --> 22:20.938
Probably just asleep.

22:38.224 --> 22:39.885
<i>He shot him in
the femoral artery!</i>

22:39.959 --> 22:41.722
Plug it with your finger!

22:41.794 --> 22:43.728
<i>Put your finger in it, Cookie!</i>

22:43.796 --> 22:44.990
I can't reach it!

22:45.064 --> 22:47.157
<i>Oh, God, it's not right!</i>

22:47.233 --> 22:48.393
No!

22:53.038 --> 22:54.938
Don't think about that.

22:56.141 --> 22:57.870
Think about something else.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.772
How many legs does a fly have?

23:01.680 --> 23:04.308
<i>Higgins, how many
legs does a fly have?</i>

23:08.420 --> 23:10.047
<i>Fly, you hang on.</i>

23:10.489 --> 23:12.787
The guys are gonna be here soon.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.917
<i>See, the guys
always sort of know</i>

23:18.330 --> 23:21.788
when I'm in trouble
and they come looking for me.

23:23.602 --> 23:24.899
Rick will know.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.738
<i>T.C. Will remember this place,
and he'll figure it out.</i>

23:32.945 --> 23:35.106
<i>Besides, so what if
this is a remote place</i>

23:35.180 --> 23:37.375
where hardly
anybody's ever been?

23:38.684 --> 23:41.084
The last guy who
was here got out.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.084
Sort of.

23:48.327 --> 23:49.794
At least his body did.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.958
<i>Yeah, they'll find me.</i>

24:01.640 --> 24:03.904
<i>Oh, no. Damn it!
Now you've done it.</i>

24:03.976 --> 24:06.001
Didn't I tell
you to stand still?

24:06.078 --> 24:08.546
<i>Cut it out, Herman! What
game are you playing now?</i>

24:08.614 --> 24:10.206
<i>It is quite simple.</i>

24:10.282 --> 24:12.773
<i>You sign the admission of guilt,</i>

24:13.352 --> 24:15.582
and you will be let
out of your cages.

24:16.488 --> 24:20.549
<i>Given a hot shower, hot food,</i>

24:21.393 --> 24:27.127
<i>and a bed with cool,
clean sheets.</i>

24:28.100 --> 24:30.694
<i>No, don't fight. Don't
let him know you're scared.</i>

24:36.141 --> 24:38.735
<i>Oh, man.
One of us has had it now.</i>

24:38.811 --> 24:40.403
Not if we keep our heads.

24:46.185 --> 24:50.178
<i>You are three months at Due Hue,
and still you are cracking jokes.</i>

24:52.591 --> 24:55.185
Are you what is
called a tough nigger?

24:59.331 --> 25:02.061
Nobody's gonna die.
Not if we use our heads.

25:03.802 --> 25:06.566
Not if I can
just get this for leverage.

25:09.308 --> 25:10.775
<i>Herman, no!</i>

25:35.100 --> 25:37.068
He shot him in
the femoral artery!

25:37.136 --> 25:39.127
Plug it with your finger!

25:39.204 --> 25:41.104
<i>Put your finger in it, Cookie!</i>

25:41.173 --> 25:42.333
I can't reach it!

25:42.408 --> 25:44.137
<i>Oh, God, it's not right!</i>

25:47.679 --> 25:49.044
<i>Fly, you okay?</i>

25:59.625 --> 26:01.058
I'm sorry.

26:02.928 --> 26:04.225
Sorry.

26:06.532 --> 26:08.090
Got to stay awake.

26:09.735 --> 26:12.295
<i>Anchors away.</i>

26:12.704 --> 26:15.002
<i>Oh, that's too easy.</i>

26:16.475 --> 26:19.000
Third verse. Got to remember the third verse.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.245
<i>Blue</i>

26:23.916 --> 26:25.213
<i>of the</i>

26:26.218 --> 26:27.913
<i>seven seas.</i>

26:29.288 --> 26:32.451
<i>Gold of God's great son.</i>

26:34.460 --> 26:37.054
<i>Let these our</i>

26:37.696 --> 26:39.891
<i>colors be.</i>

26:39.998 --> 26:41.761
<i>Till all</i>

26:42.668 --> 26:45.466
<i>our time be done.</i>

26:46.038 --> 26:47.801
<i>Done, done, done.</i>

27:12.431 --> 27:14.262
<i>I can't make it, Dad.</i>

27:38.039 --> 27:40.269
<i>Magnum.
Magnum, wake up.</i>

27:43.945 --> 27:46.106
<i>Magnum, please,
I must speak to you.</i>

27:46.181 --> 27:47.808
No! I'm sleeping.

27:48.617 --> 27:51.450
<i>You may never wake up if you
don't wake up this instant.</i>

27:51.519 --> 27:53.384
<i>You have to stop the bleeding.</i>

28:03.431 --> 28:06.059
This wouldn't have happened
if I had the aisle seat.

28:07.302 --> 28:09.293
<i>Come on, Higgins, trade with me.</i>

28:10.171 --> 28:12.002
<i>You should be in the middle,</i>

28:12.273 --> 28:14.332
shorter legs.
I'm too cramped.

28:15.543 --> 28:18.239
I'm numb from my knees down.

28:18.747 --> 28:21.113
<i>Why are you going
to Virginia anyway, Higgins?</i>

28:22.117 --> 28:23.880
<i>Come on, answer me.</i>

28:25.053 --> 28:29.114
<i>You don't think I'm capable of flying
there myself? Well, I'm capable.</i>

28:33.728 --> 28:35.025
You're right.

28:35.096 --> 28:37.462
I can't go back to sleep.
I've got to

28:39.768 --> 28:42.532
stop the bleeding.
If I can just...

28:44.339 --> 28:46.068
<i>Stewardess, damn.</i>

28:46.274 --> 28:47.605
I need some help.

28:48.543 --> 28:51.478
I got to stop the bleeding
before they start serving lunch.

28:53.415 --> 28:55.076
I'm really hungry.

28:55.717 --> 28:57.582
Can I have a glass of water?

29:01.089 --> 29:02.249
No.

29:03.258 --> 29:04.520
I'm awake.

29:05.427 --> 29:06.587
<i>Blue.</i>

29:07.862 --> 29:09.955
<i>Blue of the seven...</i>

29:10.031 --> 29:12.465
No! I've done that already.

29:15.136 --> 29:16.501
Any requests?

29:17.839 --> 29:20.273
<i>Come on, Herman,
what do you like?</i>

29:26.614 --> 29:29.549
How about you? Any requests?

29:31.953 --> 29:33.477
<i>Sleepytime Gal? Let's see.</i>

29:35.690 --> 29:37.487
<i>Sleepytime Gal...</i>

29:38.493 --> 29:41.257
<i>Oh, I'm sorry about
that rivet in your knee.</i>

29:41.329 --> 29:43.524
I bet that hurts.
You should get it fixed.

29:46.101 --> 29:49.298
<i>You know, we formally
haven't been introduced.</i>

29:49.370 --> 29:51.065
I'm Thomas Magnum.

29:51.873 --> 29:53.204
How about you?

29:55.777 --> 29:57.267
<i>You're shy, huh?</i>

29:59.047 --> 30:02.710
<i>Well, maybe I'll call you Misty.</i>

30:04.519 --> 30:05.850
Look at me.

30:06.988 --> 30:08.785
<i>I'm as helpless.</i>

30:08.857 --> 30:12.987
<i>As a kitten up a tree.</i>

30:13.128 --> 30:16.291
<i>Look at me.</i>

30:17.866 --> 30:20.494
<i>Look at me when I'm
talking to you, Mr. Magnum.</i>

30:21.002 --> 30:25.598
Stop singing and try to
concentrate on my problem.

30:27.342 --> 30:30.505
I got a thief on the
loose somewhere in my firm.

30:31.212 --> 30:33.146
I got an insurance company

30:33.214 --> 30:35.739
<i>screaming about
covering the losses,</i>

30:36.251 --> 30:38.617
<i>and you stand there with
a belt around your leg,</i>

30:38.686 --> 30:40.347
<i>trying to remember Misty.</i>

30:41.956 --> 30:43.753
<i>Look at me.</i>

30:45.860 --> 30:48.829
They screamed but they
covered the losses anyway.

30:49.898 --> 30:54.198
<i>But not your fee, Mr. Magnum.
The insurance doesn't cover that.</i>

30:54.302 --> 30:55.701
Albertson says that I...

30:55.770 --> 30:58.568
That I wasted more of Pan
Pacific's money hiring you.

30:58.807 --> 31:02.072
And he's beginning to hint that I'm
somehow involved in the embezzlement.

31:02.143 --> 31:05.943
<i>Now, please, Mr. Magnum, you've got three
weeks while he's still in Switzerland.</i>

31:06.014 --> 31:07.811
You have to find the real...

31:07.882 --> 31:09.213
Thief.

31:09.584 --> 31:11.017
Why not Michaels?

31:11.352 --> 31:14.913
<i>You already talked to most of my
key people, and came up empty-handed.</i>

31:15.456 --> 31:18.550
<i>So stop singing,
and go talk to him.</i>

31:19.194 --> 31:22.027
<i>Look at me.</i>

31:23.765 --> 31:26.199
<i>I'm as helpless.</i>

31:26.267 --> 31:30.226
<i>As a kitten up a tree.</i>

31:32.473 --> 31:34.941
<i>Never knowing my right foot.</i>

31:35.510 --> 31:37.774
<i>From my left.</i>

31:38.546 --> 31:42.448
<i>My hand from my glove.</i>

31:43.151 --> 31:45.745
<i>I'm too misty.</i>

31:46.421 --> 31:49.788
<i>And too much in love</i>

31:52.861 --> 31:55.591
I did it. Competence.

31:56.698 --> 31:58.495
<i>Is that what you wanted,
Albertson?</i>

32:01.102 --> 32:03.036
<i>No, maybe not.</i>

32:03.872 --> 32:07.137
<i>Well, you got it anyway.</i>

32:08.543 --> 32:10.511
Total competence.

32:11.212 --> 32:12.338
<i>Dad,</i>

32:13.481 --> 32:16.211
did you hear that?
I made it.

32:17.285 --> 32:18.775
I made it through the night.

32:19.954 --> 32:22.286
And I'm gonna make
it out of here

32:23.324 --> 32:25.485
just as soon as I get this...

32:35.203 --> 32:37.899
<i>Did you finish
the fly off fast, Herman?</i>

32:42.844 --> 32:46.405
I hope so. Going slow has
got to be the worst.

32:47.348 --> 32:48.872
Best to go fast.

32:56.491 --> 32:57.924
<i>T. C., come on.</i>

32:59.494 --> 33:00.984
You had all night.

33:02.130 --> 33:04.530
You want me to just lie here?

33:05.166 --> 33:07.100
<i>Must have been awful,
going that slow.</i>

33:07.168 --> 33:08.396
<i>Yes, poor devil.</i>

33:08.469 --> 33:11.370
<i>I can't believe it. After all
those shoot-outs and near misses,</i>

33:11.439 --> 33:13.202
he finally goes
from a centipede bite.

33:13.274 --> 33:14.866
<i>T. C., he bled to death.</i>

33:14.943 --> 33:16.672
He obviously succumbed
from dehydration.

33:16.744 --> 33:19.178
<i>Higgins, I'm sorry, but I
read the coroner's report.</i>

33:19.247 --> 33:22.375
<i>And I was a coroner.
North Africa, 1942.</i>

33:22.450 --> 33:25.010
I was recruited to perform
emergency autopsies for Prince...

33:25.086 --> 33:26.348
Higgie!

33:26.955 --> 33:28.650
<i>Yes, of course. Sorry.</i>

33:28.723 --> 33:30.350
But I've seen
that very same pallor

33:30.425 --> 33:32.916
on the faces of many a camel
who baked in the sun.

33:33.194 --> 33:36.789
<i>Well, whatever got him, at least he
cracked the case that was bugging him.</i>

33:36.864 --> 33:38.957
I trust you're not referring
to that absurd message

33:39.033 --> 33:40.660
Magnum left on the mountaintop?

33:40.735 --> 33:43.135
<i>Higgins, Thomas had to have
pinned it on the right guy.</i>

33:43.204 --> 33:45.695
Why? Simply because
it was his dying decree?

33:45.773 --> 33:49.004
<i>You never gave Thomas proper
respect for his abilities, Higgie.</i>

33:49.077 --> 33:50.510
<i>That's not true.
Yes, it is.</i>

33:50.578 --> 33:52.876
<i>And you were always
messing with his mail, too.</i>

34:00.054 --> 34:01.351
You're back.

34:02.156 --> 34:06.320
<i>No, no. You can't be the
same one. Herman ate you.</i>

34:10.130 --> 34:14.192
<i>Of course, the rain could've
shook you out of the web.</i>

34:14.268 --> 34:15.963
<i>Well, it doesn't matter really.</i>

34:16.036 --> 34:18.904
<i>If you're the same guy...
Same fly,</i>

34:19.206 --> 34:21.402
<i>just listen, please.</i>

34:23.811 --> 34:28.578
Stay on your toes. Up there
is off-limits. Just trust me.

34:30.650 --> 34:32.482
<i>Did you ever see the movie,
The Fly?</i>

34:33.755 --> 34:36.188
<i>I'm talking about the
original, not the remake.</i>

34:36.690 --> 34:39.819
<i>Anyway, this guy,</i>

34:40.293 --> 34:44.389
<i>he experiments,
and he switches heads</i>

34:44.766 --> 34:46.358
with a fly.

34:46.667 --> 34:48.998
So he's walking around

34:49.070 --> 34:52.766
<i>with this horrible,
hairy, ugly...</i>

34:54.275 --> 34:57.972
<i>Oh, I guess your empathies
would be with the fly. I'm sorry.</i>

34:59.147 --> 35:01.308
<i>So anyway, what happens is</i>

35:02.150 --> 35:05.449
the guy has to find the fly

35:06.287 --> 35:09.450
<i>that's got his head, but he
never does, so in the last shot</i>

35:10.024 --> 35:11.992
in the movie we see

35:12.994 --> 35:14.325
<i>this spider web,</i>

35:16.431 --> 35:21.892
<i>and this fly with this teeny
little man's head, saying,</i>

35:23.371 --> 35:25.236
<i>"Help me,"</i>

35:26.941 --> 35:29.341
"help me."

35:29.577 --> 35:31.670
<i>Somebody's trying to frame me, Mr. Magnum.</i>

35:31.746 --> 35:33.680
You have to find
the real criminal

35:33.748 --> 35:36.148
<i>before Albertson gets back.
Please,</i>

35:36.217 --> 35:37.616
do something!

35:39.620 --> 35:40.951
Damn it!

35:41.289 --> 35:43.849
I don't believe it. Why
don't clients ever listen?

35:44.659 --> 35:47.093
<i>Cut it out, Herman.
You had dinner.</i>

35:56.704 --> 36:01.266
<i>You just hold on,
fly, and don't move.</i>

36:01.342 --> 36:04.607
<i>No, strike that. That turned out
to be bad advice for my last client.</i>

36:06.080 --> 36:08.548
<i>Unless you are my last
client. Whatever, listen...</i>

36:08.816 --> 36:11.979
<i>You got to help me,
Magnum, help me!</i>

36:13.054 --> 36:15.955
<i>Michaels, you just hold on</i>

36:17.458 --> 36:19.050
till I reach...

36:34.509 --> 36:36.977
<i>Zowie!
You've had it, Herman.</i>

36:40.515 --> 36:43.109
You just yell if he
bothers you again.

36:45.586 --> 36:46.951
We got him!

36:49.223 --> 36:53.592
Who else would have the clout to
stonewall my investigation for six weeks?

36:55.930 --> 36:57.989
When we get out
of here I'm gonna prove it.

36:58.065 --> 37:01.796
Prove what? Why do you want to know
if I have an address in Switzerland?

37:01.903 --> 37:04.269
<i>I fired you this morning,
remember?</i>

37:04.338 --> 37:05.532
Now get!

37:07.208 --> 37:10.405
No! I thought I had you.

37:13.614 --> 37:14.945
I had...

37:15.016 --> 37:16.176
<i>Aim!</i>

37:17.552 --> 37:18.917
<i>Fire!</i>

37:19.120 --> 37:20.314
<i>Aim!</i>

37:21.055 --> 37:22.647
Fire!

37:22.723 --> 37:23.849
Aim!

37:24.692 --> 37:25.852
<i>Fire!</i>

37:30.131 --> 37:31.496
Don't do it.

37:47.148 --> 37:48.376
Rick!

37:50.251 --> 37:52.685
Higgins! Up here!

37:56.390 --> 37:59.086
<i>Pack your bags, fly,
we're home free.</i>

37:59.327 --> 38:01.625
<i>I hope so, Mr. Magnum.</i>

38:01.729 --> 38:04.892
<i>Please, help me.</i>

38:05.166 --> 38:08.158
Help me.

38:08.970 --> 38:12.167
<i>Damn it, Michaels, stop
feeling sorry for yourself.</i>

38:12.406 --> 38:13.873
Pull yourself together.

38:13.941 --> 38:18.002
<i>You're right, of course. You'll
think of something. Won't you?</i>

39:13.701 --> 39:14.895
Come here.

39:30.484 --> 39:32.145
<i>We got 'em now, darling.</i>

40:08.756 --> 40:10.223
<i>Okay, guys,</i>

40:12.293 --> 40:15.524
<i>if you're gonna find me,
now'd be a good time.</i>

40:16.997 --> 40:18.464
I'm holding it up.

40:20.134 --> 40:21.897
<i>I'm holding it up, guys.</i>

40:23.204 --> 40:25.172
I'm holding up the plane.

40:28.042 --> 40:29.407
I can't let go.

40:32.146 --> 40:33.340
Guys!

40:35.049 --> 40:36.380
Help me.

40:38.486 --> 40:39.714
Help me.

40:56.786 --> 40:58.014
<i>Okay,</i>

41:00.524 --> 41:03.584
<i>decision time, guys.
Try to remember physics.</i>

41:06.930 --> 41:08.420
There's one way.

41:10.033 --> 41:13.025
<i>I can swing this thing,
and we're out of here,</i>

41:13.803 --> 41:15.828
and about a half a dozen ways

41:17.707 --> 41:20.699
I can swing it
and wish I hadn't.

41:39.563 --> 41:40.621
Rick.

41:41.264 --> 41:43.926
<i>Don't worry about that little
problem, Thomas. I can cover.</i>

41:44.000 --> 41:45.058
Then cover!

41:45.135 --> 41:47.535
Maybe you should
have called Jerry Watkins.

41:47.971 --> 41:50.405
He wouldn't let you down.
T.C.

41:50.807 --> 41:52.707
<i>Magnum, please be calm.</i>

41:52.776 --> 41:54.744
Calm? Calm?

41:55.645 --> 41:57.840
I got an airplane in my face.

42:11.761 --> 42:13.228
<i>Hey, Misty,</i>

42:13.663 --> 42:16.564
<i>you hear those gunshots, or
am I just dreaming 'em up?</i>

42:20.503 --> 42:22.471
I guess it doesn't make
a whole lot of difference.

42:22.539 --> 42:25.474
<i>One way or the other, I'm gonna
have to get myself out of this.</i>

42:28.211 --> 42:29.542
<i>What do you say, pal?</i>

42:33.950 --> 42:35.884
<i>If I could figure
out the leverage,</i>

42:36.786 --> 42:39.084
I just might get us out of this.

42:39.222 --> 42:41.349
But then you're on your own.

42:41.625 --> 42:43.650
<i>Go on, back off, Herman,</i>

42:49.633 --> 42:53.296
I just need a little more time
to be sure of the leverage.

43:01.611 --> 43:04.045
<i>So long, Misty.
Nice meeting you.</i>

43:20.404 --> 43:22.964
<i>Did you get the pig?
No, he got away, I think.</i>

43:23.134 --> 43:24.795
Did you hit it?
I don't know.

43:25.004 --> 43:27.234
Maybe it's still in the bushes.

43:28.807 --> 43:30.832
The bugger's still moving.

44:26.364 --> 44:28.059
I'm afraid there's no way

44:28.133 --> 44:31.068
<i>you could have accomplished
that feat, Mr. Magnum.</i>

44:31.636 --> 44:34.230
<i>You see, we already
have the embezzler in jail.</i>

44:36.775 --> 44:39.903
<i>Well, we found a great deal
of cash in Michaels' house.</i>

44:40.879 --> 44:42.574
Cash he cannot explain.

44:42.647 --> 44:46.208
Can you explain the source of
your account in Switzerland?

44:46.284 --> 44:49.720
<i>See, it was just a hunch, since you've
been spending so much time there lately,</i>

44:49.788 --> 44:54.122
but I was able to turn that hunch into
a couple of secret bank account numbers.

44:55.260 --> 44:56.591
Come on.

44:56.795 --> 44:59.821
You can't come up with
secret bank account numbers.

44:59.898 --> 45:02.526
<i>Oh, you can if you
know the right people.</i>

45:02.601 --> 45:05.468
<i>And speaking of that, you'll be
hearing from a friend of mine.</i>

45:05.537 --> 45:08.836
Carol Baldwin. You'll like
her. She's a real nice lady.

45:08.940 --> 45:11.204
And an assistant
prosecuting attorney.

45:11.276 --> 45:12.766
<i>You can't prove anything.</i>

45:12.844 --> 45:14.573
<i>Oh, I think we can.</i>

45:15.947 --> 45:18.211
I picked up
your mail for you again.

45:19.250 --> 45:22.845
Don't bother to thank me. It's
the usual assortment of junk mail

45:22.921 --> 45:26.084
<i>addressed to occupant, and
a couple of past due notices.</i>

45:27.325 --> 45:28.917
My God!

45:30.061 --> 45:32.461
<i>What on Earth...
Rick, hi.</i>

45:33.064 --> 45:35.965
<i>No, I'm fine. Listen,
about my tab at the club...</i>

45:36.034 --> 45:37.592
What could possibly have hap...

45:37.669 --> 45:40.934
You can tell the accountant to expect
a check by the beginning of the week.

45:41.006 --> 45:42.166
Bye.

45:42.374 --> 45:44.672
<i>Magnum.
Hi, Higgins.</i>

45:44.809 --> 45:47.300
What happened?
I solved the case.

45:47.379 --> 45:48.778
The reward money's on its way.

45:48.847 --> 45:50.337
<i>No, I mean...</i>

45:50.649 --> 45:52.810
I slipped in my mom's tub.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.815
<i>Oh, T. C., hold on,
just a minute.</i>

45:58.490 --> 46:00.685
<i>Higgins,
it's real busy right now.</i>

46:00.759 --> 46:02.818
<i>I appreciate your
dropping off the mail,</i>

46:02.894 --> 46:04.361
but you won't have
to do that anymore.

46:04.429 --> 46:06.624
I can manage from here on out. Thanks.

46:07.465 --> 46:09.763
You slipped in your
mother's tub?

46:10.035 --> 46:13.903
<i>Yes. And I knew if anybody
would understand, you would.</i>

46:19.244 --> 46:20.370
Quite.

46:21.880 --> 46:24.576
<i>Hi, T.C. No, I'm fine.</i>

46:25.316 --> 46:27.648
<i>Listen,
I thought I might take your.</i>

46:27.719 --> 46:31.018
Pop Warner team out for hot
dogs after practice Saturday.

46:32.323 --> 46:33.813
<i>No, I want to.</i>

46:36.895 --> 46:40.228
<i>Yeah, sure, you can invite
Jerry Watkins if you want to.</i>

46:40.965 --> 46:43.297
But you won't
really need a backup.

46:43.568 --> 46:45.229
I'll see you then.
