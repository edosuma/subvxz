00:01.000 --> 00:04.516
[Watch ticking]

00:04.600 --> 00:06.432
[Walkers growling in distance]

00:12.640 --> 00:16.599
So, that thing you wanted to tell me...

00:16.680 --> 00:18.751
What?

00:18.840 --> 00:20.353
Oh. Uh, yeah.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.431
- Nothin'.
- Jerry...

00:22.520 --> 00:25.034
Okay, but I swore
I wasn't gonna say anything yet,

00:25.120 --> 00:26.349
so you can't, either.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.760
Not till I say so.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.917
- Swear?
- Solemnly.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.879
Just... spit the gum out.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.550
You swear, too, Carol?

00:36.680 --> 00:39.433
Yeah. Cross my heart.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.796
- Spill it.
- Okay.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.757
Nabila and I...

00:43.840 --> 00:46.639
-are bunned up.
- What?

00:46.720 --> 00:49.360
- We're up the pole.
- What?

00:49.440 --> 00:51.829
We're preggo! Preggers.

00:51.920 --> 00:53.115
Got our preg on.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.554
Nabila's pregnant?

00:54.640 --> 00:56.790
Doc says about eight weeks.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.520
Dude, I'm gonna be a daddy, Your Majesty.

00:59.600 --> 01:01.477
[Laughing]

01:03.440 --> 01:04.714
The future begins!

01:04.800 --> 01:06.359
Congratulations, man.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.113
You are
the biggest-hearted among us.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.589
Thank you, Your Majesty.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.830
But, just, uh...

01:12.920 --> 01:16.117
Oh, Jerry-- Jerry...

01:16.200 --> 01:18.191
-[Horse whinnies]
- They're coming.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.270
[Walker growling]

01:41.720 --> 01:44.439
We really appreciate this.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.636
Maggie wanted
to thank you personally,

01:46.720 --> 01:48.040
but with people still sick...

01:48.120 --> 01:49.838
I'm just glad to hear
the worst is past.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.189
Thanks to the Kingdom.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.759
And to you, too, apparently.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.439
We were surprised to see you.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.034
Yeah, well, not as surprised
as Michonne's gonna be

01:57.120 --> 01:59.475
when she realizes
I'm not going back home.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.438
Yeah, I kind of took off
with more supplies

02:02.520 --> 02:05.034
than the Council was willing to spare.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.680
I get why they think
Alexandria couldn't do more,

02:07.760 --> 02:10.036
but we're family.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.758
Speaking of...

02:11.840 --> 02:14.036
Oh, yeah. Forgot.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.555
I grabbed one more thing before I left.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.831
Michonne was letting it collect dust.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.158
Uh, Maggie's not exactly

02:26.240 --> 02:28.436
the biggest fan of Michonne right now.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.636
So we thought you could hold on to it.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.071
I thank you.

02:35.160 --> 02:38.710
I haven't given up
on the idea this embodies.

02:38.800 --> 02:39.995
I still believe

02:40.080 --> 02:42.276
that this will bind us
into something more,

02:42.360 --> 02:43.589
because we are family.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.318
When the time comes, we'll reunite.

02:45.400 --> 02:46.879
The leaders will sign it together,

02:46.960 --> 02:49.713
and our communities
will begin anew again.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.519
As one.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.954
Until that day,

02:54.040 --> 02:55.872
I am honored to be the keeper
of the path forward.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.918
That's what we were counting on.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.638
Thank you again.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.233
For everything.

03:04.360 --> 03:05.873
Carol: Take care.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.519
Give Maggie our best.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.079
We Will.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.513
[Horses whinny]

03:14.600 --> 03:17.638

[Door opens, closes]

03:55.880 --> 03:57.553
Hey, boss?

03:59.240 --> 04:02.995
Five minutes till go.

04:09.480 --> 04:13.235
[Door opens, closes]

04:13.320 --> 04:15.391
Dianne: Spotter puts the count
at a hundred,

04:15.480 --> 04:17.072
just east of Falls Church.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.435
Ezekiel: Enough elk to feed all of us,

04:19.519 --> 04:21.430
plus half of Hilltop, Oceanside,

04:21.519 --> 04:23.113
and Alexandria for a week.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.389
And Alfred?

04:24.480 --> 04:25.800
About 200,

04:25.880 --> 04:28.110
also heading to Falls Church.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.191
We've got a good six hours

04:30.280 --> 04:32.191
to get to those elk
before the dead do.

04:32.280 --> 04:33.554
And so we shall.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.392
Thanks for the update, Dianne.

04:35.480 --> 04:36.993
It's good to have you back.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.196
Good to be back. [Clicks tongue]

04:39.280 --> 04:42.272
[indistinct conversations]

04:42.360 --> 04:44.033
Alexandria, huh?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.474
You know something I don't?

04:45.560 --> 04:46.914
Crazier things have happened.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.229
Are you...?

04:48.320 --> 04:51.119
Going on the hunt? Sure am.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.634
Got a problem with that, mister?

04:52.720 --> 04:54.040
I simply assumed

04:54.120 --> 04:55.838
the queen was handling
preparations for the fair.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.149
Don't call me that.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.231
It's handled. It's just...

04:59.360 --> 05:02.512
Still feels like an empty nest.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.479
That and maybe
I just missed you a little bit

05:05.560 --> 05:06.789
while I was gone.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.871
As did I, my...

05:08.960 --> 05:10.189
my love.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.476
As did I.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.631
Onward!

05:16.720 --> 05:19.075
To collect our bounty!

05:19.160 --> 05:22.357
And in a few days' time, we feast.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.156
It's all gonna work out.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.675
Yeah.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.676
Our community is more than capable

05:50.760 --> 05:52.876
of defending itself!

05:52.960 --> 05:56.999
Alpha: I show you my face
because we mean you no harm.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.515
I just want my daughter.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.637
I know you have her.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.474
You should turn around.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.120
Leave now and no one gets hurt.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.710
Wrong answer.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.119
[Grunts]

07:27.200 --> 07:28.520
It's a little arthritis flare-up,

07:28.600 --> 07:30.113
but you two are acting like
I'm on my death bed.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.111
Tammy Rose: You damn well could've been,

07:32.200 --> 07:34.760
spilling all that hot metal like you did.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.990
Well, I'm gonna give you eucalyptus

07:37.080 --> 07:38.559
for the pain and inflammation

07:38.640 --> 07:40.597
and aloe for the burns.

07:40.680 --> 07:44.435
We'll start with that, see how you do.

07:44.520 --> 07:46.158
You should really think about
taking a break.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.550
- Tammy Rose: How about for good?
- Tammy Rose...

07:48.640 --> 07:50.597
I've been telling him
this is gonna happen for years.

07:50.680 --> 07:52.273
What he needs to do is retire--

07:52.360 --> 07:53.919
I'm not gonna retire,
and I don't need a break.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.229
Are we done here?

07:56.840 --> 07:59.958
I have another
two dozen horseshoes to finish

08:00.080 --> 08:02.196
before we leave for the fair.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.032
Thanks, Doc.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.589
[Door opens, closes]

08:06.680 --> 08:08.671
Appreciate you coming by...

08:08.760 --> 08:11.274
and putting up with Earl's crabbing.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.714
[Chuckles] I get it.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.711
This work's important to him.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.234
It ain't just that.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.914
In all the years
since our Kenneth has passed,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.594
it's been his way
to fill the empty, you know?

08:21.680 --> 08:22.875
Alden being gone,

08:22.960 --> 08:24.473
I think it just brought it all back.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.039
Yeah, uh...

08:26.120 --> 08:28.680
Earl's always been a father to him--

08:28.760 --> 08:30.239
to both of us.

08:30.360 --> 08:33.000
Don't you lose hope, you hear me?

08:33.080 --> 08:34.514
Alden will turn up.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.831
A million things
could've happened, all right?

08:37.919 --> 08:39.274
Yeah.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.270
[Man whistles]

08:41.360 --> 08:43.874
Hey, Marco, what's happening?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.435
The ones that killed Jesus...

08:46.520 --> 08:49.273
they're here.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.989
They don't see her.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.957
Least not yet.

09:06.560 --> 09:09.393
Daryl: That girl told me
what her mom does to her.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.676
We ain't sending her back to that.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.070
Tara: Yeah, but what if
she has Alden and Luke?

09:14.160 --> 09:16.754
Pissing her off can get them killed.

09:16.840 --> 09:19.514
Did you kill our friends?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.955
We found their horses.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.310
No.

09:24.400 --> 09:30.476
Which one of you leads these people?

09:31.920 --> 09:34.230
What the hell does it matter?

09:34.320 --> 09:38.075
Then I'll just address all of you.

09:38.160 --> 09:41.869
Your people crossed into our land.

09:41.960 --> 09:44.952
There will be no conflict.

09:45.040 --> 09:48.431
Your people killed our people.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.512
There will be no conflict.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.910
I'm done talkin'.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.911
Bring me my daughter,

09:56.000 --> 09:59.391
or there will be conflict.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.710
No one touches the girl.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.313
- Daryl.
- Where's he going?

10:03.400 --> 10:04.629
Daryl, stop.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.199
Enid: Does she have Alden and Luke?

10:06.280 --> 10:08.715
- I don't know.
- What does she want?

10:08.800 --> 10:10.950
No, Daryl, we-- we can't do that.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.190
- She ain't gettin' her.
- Then what are you doing?

10:13.280 --> 10:15.749
She's done talkin'. I'm not.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.956
Come on.

10:25.640 --> 10:27.517
Ezekiel: Well-done, good people.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.353
Hurry these back to preserve
the fruits of our labor.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.472
The dead will be upon us
in less than an hour's time.

10:34.880 --> 10:38.077
I was thinking you could accompany them.

10:38.160 --> 10:41.471
To protect the cargo.

10:43.040 --> 10:45.190
We're not heading back together?

10:50.080 --> 10:51.991
What's going on?

10:52.080 --> 10:53.753
Where's everybody else going,

10:53.880 --> 10:55.109
and why are you scared to tell me?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.315
Scared?

10:56.400 --> 10:58.311
What? [Laughs]

10:59.360 --> 11:02.796
Jerry, is this the face
of a scared man?

11:03.920 --> 11:05.957
No comment, Your Majesty.

11:08.280 --> 11:09.554
[Chuckles nervously]

11:09.640 --> 11:12.200
You see, there's this little,
uh, side mission

11:12.280 --> 11:14.112
that some of us
have been planning for a while,

11:14.200 --> 11:15.679
to pick up one last item for the fair.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.195
It'll just take a few minutes--

11:18.320 --> 11:19.958
plenty of time to avoid the herd.

11:20.040 --> 11:22.429
But it's nothing
you'd be interested in, so...

11:22.520 --> 11:23.874
Try me.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.240
How about I show you?

11:29.320 --> 11:31.470
[Walkers growling]

11:37.240 --> 11:40.153
It's movie time.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.232
Movie time.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.038
- It's movi--
- Jerry.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.235
Yeah, okay.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.511
[Walkers growling]

12:10.360 --> 12:12.715
Go get 'em.

12:49.400 --> 12:53.075
You can't have her.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.310
Now...

12:55.400 --> 12:58.677
if it's a fight you're lookin' for,

12:58.760 --> 13:02.310
we got enough firepower
to light you up.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.357
Right here and now.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.638
[Baby coos]

13:10.160 --> 13:13.949
[Cooing continues]

13:20.000 --> 13:22.355
You brought a baby out here?

13:23.960 --> 13:25.678
We're animals.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.229
Animals live out here.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.550
Animals have babies.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.712
So we have babies out here.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.792
Now, what were you sayin'?

13:36.880 --> 13:39.679
Lightin' us all up?

13:39.760 --> 13:42.559
You seem to want conflict.

13:42.640 --> 13:43.960
I don't.

13:44.040 --> 13:48.511
So I'm proposing a trade.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.759
I wanted to kill them.

13:58.840 --> 14:01.912
But I want my daughter more.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.879
One of mine, two of yours.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.758
It's a good trade,

14:06.840 --> 14:09.070
which is why you're gonna take it.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.760
Now...

14:11.840 --> 14:15.879
bring me my daughter.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.479
A projector bulb? Really?

14:22.560 --> 14:24.233
Ezekiel: I know.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.993
It's not something we absolutely need,

14:26.080 --> 14:27.991
and it's a little dangerous, but...

14:28.080 --> 14:29.514
we got it all planned out.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.671
- There's a herd coming.
- We can beat it.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.910
In and out, like a cobra strike.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.196
[Walkers growling]

14:36.280 --> 14:38.999
We're barely getting by
with what we have.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.991
These people are fathers and mothers.
