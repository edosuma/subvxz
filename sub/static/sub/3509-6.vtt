00:01.437 --> 00:02.386
There are two kinds of folks

00:02.443 --> 00:04.043
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:04.377 --> 00:06.103
Psychopaths
and mystery writers.

00:06.341 --> 00:07.363
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:07.764 --> 00:09.503
Who am I?
I'm Rick Castle.

00:09.593 --> 00:10.653
Castle.
Castle.

00:10.688 --> 00:12.388
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:12.442 --> 00:14.632
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.842 --> 00:15.661
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.908 --> 00:17.175
Beckett.
Aah!

00:17.448 --> 00:19.533
Beckett?
Could you get some backup, please?

00:19.884 --> 00:21.768
<i>And thanks to my friendship
with the Mayor,</i>

00:21.819 --> 00:23.453
<i>I get to be on her case.
Oh!</i>

00:23.487 --> 00:26.056
Do I look like a killer to you?
Yes, you kill my patience.

00:26.090 --> 00:27.724
<i>And together,
we catch killers.</i>

00:28.272 --> 00:31.174
I hate this case.
I know. Isn't it great?

01:10.468 --> 01:12.002
What about Ashley?

01:12.070 --> 01:14.004
I mean, shouldn't I tell him?

01:14.072 --> 01:15.973
Darling, in matters
of the heart,

01:16.041 --> 01:18.007
it's best
not to overthink things.

01:18.075 --> 01:20.309
That's your advice, mother,
with your track record?

01:20.377 --> 01:22.812
What chasm of doom
has she led you to

01:22.880 --> 01:24.914
by way of her tips on romance?

01:24.982 --> 01:26.515
As it happens,

01:26.584 --> 01:29.452
we were discussing
secret admirer etiquette.

01:29.519 --> 01:30.611
You have a secret admirer?

01:30.711 --> 01:33.724
I always thought it was silly,
but now I'm kind of intrigued.

01:33.824 --> 01:36.859
And there is no need
to tell Ashley.

01:36.927 --> 01:39.395
How exactly
does a secret admirer

01:39.463 --> 01:41.864
express his admiration?

01:41.932 --> 01:43.633
He left a note in my locker.

01:43.701 --> 01:45.568
"As you walked down the hall,

01:45.636 --> 01:48.904
"a shard of sunlight glanced off
your rope of flaxen hair

01:48.972 --> 01:51.907
and set it aglow,
and I was enchanted."

01:51.975 --> 01:54.076
Oh, that's so poetic.

01:54.143 --> 01:56.845
I figure the rope of flaxen hair
is my french braid,

01:56.913 --> 01:59.514
which I only wore after gym
class, which means he saw me

01:59.582 --> 02:02.550
in the hall on the first floor
between fourth and fifth period.

02:02.619 --> 02:03.932
- Wait a minute. What are you doing?
- Narrowing down suspects.

02:04.230 --> 02:07.570
No, you can't do that. No, you...
No, that'll ruin the secret.

02:07.802 --> 02:08.752
No, it's like a mystery novel.

02:08.852 --> 02:11.053
You don't just go
to the last page, do you?

02:11.120 --> 02:12.376
Yes.

02:12.576 --> 02:15.857
You do? Well, you shouldn't.
It's not... You can't...

02:17.694 --> 02:20.095
The... the joy doesn't come

02:20.163 --> 02:21.830
in knowing who did it.

02:21.897 --> 02:24.666
The joy comes in the journey,

02:24.734 --> 02:26.768
in allowing the ending
to blossom

02:26.836 --> 02:29.371
like some magnificent
Himalayan Blue Poppy,

02:29.439 --> 02:31.340
- like a...
- Okay.

02:31.407 --> 02:34.443
Okay.
I'll let him stay a secret.

02:34.511 --> 02:36.745
Mark my words.
You'll thank me.

02:36.812 --> 02:38.614
Mm.

02:40.016 --> 02:41.650
Castle.

02:41.717 --> 02:45.086
So our victim is Linda Russo.

02:45.155 --> 02:48.056
She's a customer relations
worker at a cable company.

02:48.124 --> 02:50.125
Maybe someone was unsatisfied
with their service.

02:50.192 --> 02:51.466
Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

02:51.666 --> 02:52.866
You were?

02:53.328 --> 02:54.829
Oh.

02:54.897 --> 02:57.766
Sanitation workers found her
body under a couple of boxes.

02:57.833 --> 03:01.002
She lives 2 blocks away,
over at 24th and 10th.

03:01.070 --> 03:02.804
Looks like she was
on her way home.

03:02.872 --> 03:04.305
Hey, Lanie.

03:04.373 --> 03:06.007
Hey.

03:08.978 --> 03:10.578
What?

03:10.646 --> 03:12.080
Uh...

03:12.148 --> 03:13.581
It's nothing.

03:13.649 --> 03:15.483
No, what?

03:15.551 --> 03:18.252
Well, she just...
Looks so peaceful.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.789
There's nothing peaceful
about what put her here.

03:20.856 --> 03:23.523
- She was strangled.
- With rope?

03:23.591 --> 03:26.060
So it appears.

03:26.127 --> 03:27.545
Castle, do you have a theory

03:27.596 --> 03:29.068
that you would like to share
with the class?

03:29.168 --> 03:32.337
Well, I-I... It's just that,
pretty blonde girl, strangled,

03:32.671 --> 03:35.106
laid out like she was asleep.

03:35.174 --> 03:37.475
That was four years ago.

03:37.543 --> 03:40.941
Yes, but he was never caught.
This is his M.O.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.909
And she is certainly his type.

03:42.977 --> 03:45.330
I researched him for
"When it Comes to Slaughter."

03:45.430 --> 03:47.803
Yeah? Well, then you should know
that he killed his victims

03:47.903 --> 03:50.404
inside their apartments,
not in alleyways.

03:50.472 --> 03:51.560
And he posed them

03:51.639 --> 03:54.311
in a funereal pose with their
hands clasped in front of them.

03:55.409 --> 03:57.139
Maybe he's switching up
his act.

03:57.339 --> 03:59.165
Or this just could be
a crime of opportunity

03:59.265 --> 04:00.825
where a young woman
was murdered.

04:04.904 --> 04:06.805
Mrs. Russo, did your daughter
ever talk to you

04:06.873 --> 04:08.340
about being followed?

04:08.407 --> 04:10.308
No. Nothing like that.

04:10.376 --> 04:12.248
Can you think of anyone that
might have wanted to harm her?

04:12.348 --> 04:13.622
Any relationship problems?

04:13.822 --> 04:15.066
She wasn't even dating.

04:16.093 --> 04:17.642
Pretty much
all she did was work.

04:17.743 --> 04:19.644
- At the, uh, cable company, right?
- Mm-hmm.

04:19.711 --> 04:22.280
Did she have any issues
with anyone there?

04:22.348 --> 04:24.714
Uh... there was
a man at her office.

04:24.782 --> 04:26.984
- What was his name?
- She didn't say.

04:27.052 --> 04:30.154
But he stared at her a lot,
like some pervert.

04:37.028 --> 04:39.296
- That was quick.
- 9-1-1 has that affect on her.

04:39.364 --> 04:40.554
What'd you find?

04:40.566 --> 04:43.731
I pulled all the files on all his
past murders, just like you asked.

04:43.734 --> 04:45.735
I-I believe
that was my idea.

04:45.803 --> 04:48.038
Yeah, but I only listen
when it comes from her.

04:48.106 --> 04:49.974
Anyway, you were saying?

04:50.041 --> 04:51.575
He choked them using

04:51.642 --> 04:53.510
a 3-strand, twisted
quarter-inch rope.

04:53.578 --> 04:56.012
Based on the fibers found
embedded in the skin,

04:56.080 --> 04:58.781
we know that the rope
is green and white nylon.

04:58.849 --> 05:01.351
I don't remember that.

05:01.418 --> 05:03.219
Those details
were never made public.

05:03.287 --> 05:05.754
Now check this out.

05:08.492 --> 05:10.193
The marks are identical.

05:10.260 --> 05:13.496
I found the exact same
green and white fibers.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.731
It is him.

05:15.799 --> 05:17.800
The triple killer is back.

05:17.868 --> 05:20.736
For those of you
living in a cave four years ago,

05:20.804 --> 05:22.905
the triple killer, or 3xk,

05:22.973 --> 05:25.140
got his nickname by strangling
three women in a week,

05:25.208 --> 05:27.142
dropping out of sight
for a month,

05:27.210 --> 05:29.044
and then killing three more,
then he disappeared.

05:29.112 --> 05:31.146
I served on the task force

05:31.214 --> 05:33.382
that investigated
those six murders.

05:33.449 --> 05:36.485
An FBI profile was as close as
we came to I.D.'ing a suspect.

05:36.552 --> 05:40.555
- The Feds say he's a white male,
25 to 45 years old...- Could be me.

05:40.756 --> 05:42.724
- With a dysfunctional relationship
with his mother. - Still me.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.739
He has a menial,
unimportant job.

05:44.839 --> 05:46.029
Definitely you.

05:46.329 --> 05:49.297
Just for that, I base my next book
on Esposito. He'd learn their habits,

05:49.365 --> 05:51.299
and then gain access
to their apartments

05:51.367 --> 05:53.268
by disguising himself
as a security guard

05:53.336 --> 05:56.170
or a repairman,
and then he strangled 'em.

05:56.238 --> 05:59.153
Then he posed their bodies as if
they were lying in a coffin.

06:00.008 --> 06:01.797
What do you think
that's all about?

06:01.811 --> 06:04.230
Probably reenacting
some terrible early trauma.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.078
Hmm.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.168
Two final points...
The triple killer

06:07.236 --> 06:09.103
seems to be back
after four years.

06:09.171 --> 06:11.906
There must be a reason.
Maybe he just got out of prison

06:11.974 --> 06:14.108
or returned to town.
He may have altered his M.O.

06:14.176 --> 06:17.579
But let's assume that he's
working under the same clock...

06:17.646 --> 06:19.347
Three murders, one week.

06:19.415 --> 06:21.315
Based on Linda Russo's
time of death,

06:21.384 --> 06:23.418
we're already into day three.

06:23.486 --> 06:25.058
Let's move on this, people.

06:27.122 --> 06:30.090
Hey. That perv the mom
told us about?

06:30.157 --> 06:32.025
Linda's colleagues knew
who he was right away.

06:32.093 --> 06:33.694
Paul McCardle.

06:33.762 --> 06:35.248
He works at her office
as a horticultural technician.

06:35.348 --> 06:36.748
A what?

06:36.898 --> 06:39.165
Uh, you know, he's the guy
who waters the plants,

06:39.233 --> 06:41.067
dusts the fake ficus,
or at least he was

06:41.135 --> 06:42.703
until he quit yesterday.

06:42.771 --> 06:43.966
That's interesting timing.

06:44.039 --> 06:46.549
I see domestic complaints
by the double digits.

06:46.649 --> 06:47.608
Filed by his wife.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.510
Ex-wife. They were
divorced last month

06:49.577 --> 06:51.311
after being married
for four years.

06:51.379 --> 06:53.445
So in a way, he did
just get out of prison.

06:53.645 --> 06:54.415
It gets even better.

06:54.416 --> 06:56.583
Linda's neighbors said
they remember seeing

06:56.651 --> 06:59.119
a red Sentra parked outside
her apartment a few days ago...

06:59.186 --> 07:00.155
The same vehicle McCardle has.

07:00.355 --> 07:01.555
Let's get him in here.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.025
So what's this about?
Linda Russo.

07:05.092 --> 07:07.827
Where were you 2 nights ago
between 6:00 and midnight?

07:07.895 --> 07:11.531
Ome
buddies at, uh, Galaxy Lanes.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.566
So why did you decide
to abandon your career

07:13.634 --> 07:14.893
as a horticultural technician?

07:14.993 --> 07:16.193
I-I just wanted to move on.

07:16.503 --> 07:19.339
Because you used that job
to watch Linda, to stalk her.

07:19.407 --> 07:21.374
And once she was dead,
why stick around?

07:21.442 --> 07:23.509
That is not true.
I'm innocent here.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.478
Well, you don't look innocent.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.547
No, as a matter of fact,
you give new meaning

07:27.614 --> 07:29.549
to the phrase
"sweating a suspect."

07:29.616 --> 07:31.201
Okay, yeah,
I perspire a lot, okay?

07:31.218 --> 07:32.958
I have a medical condition.

07:33.058 --> 07:35.577
Well, that's the least of
your problems, Mr. McCardle.

07:35.755 --> 07:38.557
Your fixation with Linda Russo
was well known,

07:38.624 --> 07:40.559
as was your history
of violence against women.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.494
Your car was seen
outside of her apartment,

07:42.562 --> 07:44.229
and now she's dead.

07:44.297 --> 07:47.099
I never touched her.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.468
I had a thing for Linda, okay.
I had a thing for Linda,

07:49.535 --> 07:51.026
and I parked
out in front of her place.

07:51.072 --> 07:53.745
But I haven't been anywhere
near there in three days, okay?

07:53.845 --> 07:55.336
Not since
that guy threatened me.

07:55.436 --> 07:56.534
What guy?

07:56.949 --> 07:58.884
I-I got... I got rousted
by some security guy,

07:58.951 --> 08:02.186
and... and he told me to move on.
And it really freaked me out,

08:02.254 --> 08:04.055
and I haven't
been back there since.

08:04.123 --> 08:06.457
I swear. That's the truth.

08:06.525 --> 08:10.189
So sweaty Von sweats-a-lot?
His alibi is holding.

08:10.289 --> 08:12.567
The manager of Galaxy Lanes
has him throwing gutter balls

08:12.658 --> 08:13.883
from 5:00 until close.

08:13.983 --> 08:15.183
What about the security guard?

08:15.360 --> 08:17.295
Ryan checked into that.
Turns out that there's

08:17.362 --> 08:19.297
only one building on
Linda's block that uses guards.

08:19.364 --> 08:20.799
According to
the security company,

08:20.866 --> 08:22.733
no incident report
was ever filed

08:22.802 --> 08:23.799
against McCardle
or his vehicle.

08:23.999 --> 08:24.969
So McCardle was lying.

08:26.104 --> 08:28.139
Maybe not.
You know, in the past,

08:28.239 --> 08:30.173
the triple killer
posed as a security guard.

08:30.241 --> 08:32.140
Maybe our guard
wasn't a guard after all.

08:32.207 --> 08:35.644
Maybe it was the triple killer
moving McCardle off of his turf.

08:35.711 --> 08:38.948
Well, whoever he is,
he's sticking to his schedule.

08:39.015 --> 08:40.448
We have a second victim.

Same rope marks on her neck,
same everything.

08:59.105 --> 09:02.007
- When did she die?
- Uh, based on liver temp,

09:02.075 --> 09:04.243
I'd say sometime last night,
probably early evening.

09:04.311 --> 09:07.012
Neighbors saw a gas repairman
leave at 7:45.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.747
No doorman on the building,

09:08.815 --> 09:11.116
so triple killer calls
Kim Foster on the intercom,

09:11.184 --> 09:14.286
says he wants to check
a gas leak, she buzzes him in.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.188
- Let me check the incoming caller I.D.s.
- Ah.

09:16.255 --> 09:19.224
I don't get it. Why did
he return to the old M.O.?

09:19.292 --> 09:22.061
- Nostalgia.
- He killed Linda Russo in an alley.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.727
She didn't have a doorman
either. Why didn't he

09:23.764 --> 09:25.732
just kill her in her apartment
like all the others?

09:25.818 --> 09:27.785
Well, maybe she was
special somehow.

09:27.853 --> 09:31.055
Vic's last incoming call was
at 7:35 from the front door.

09:31.123 --> 09:34.202
She must have been let him in,
and boom, he just overpowered her.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.430
Maybe it wasn't that easy.
Look at those throw pillows.

09:36.431 --> 09:38.280
What's wrong with 'em?

09:38.380 --> 09:40.291
Well, Kim Foster's
an interior designer.

09:40.328 --> 09:42.161
These pillows
have been arranged

09:42.229 --> 09:44.013
with a barbarian-like
gracelessness.

09:44.097 --> 09:45.016
Like a man would do it.

09:45.216 --> 09:46.397
So she put up a fight.

09:46.497 --> 09:47.500
They struggled
right here on the couch.

09:47.601 --> 09:49.306
And then he reset the pillows
to cover it up.

09:49.406 --> 09:51.708
He's out of practice,
so he's not so neat.

09:53.963 --> 09:55.196
- Hup!
- What?

09:55.264 --> 09:57.198
Found a Penny.

09:57.266 --> 09:59.534
Under the circumstances,
is this still lucky?

09:59.601 --> 10:02.570
Wait. I think
I found something, too.

10:04.807 --> 10:07.129
Vince. You think it belonged
to the killer?

10:07.229 --> 10:08.301
Or maybe it's been here
for weeks.

10:08.401 --> 10:10.402
I'm gonna have to get C.S.U.
to process this area.

10:13.916 --> 10:16.851
Sir... a Mr. Townsend
wants a word.

10:18.587 --> 10:20.654
Bring him in.

10:20.722 --> 10:22.857
Cal.

10:22.925 --> 10:24.558
Good to see you.

10:24.626 --> 10:26.027
Hey.

10:26.095 --> 10:28.363
How's Marie?

10:28.430 --> 10:31.732
Uh... she's okay.

10:33.635 --> 10:35.303
We're split up now.

10:35.371 --> 10:37.872
I'm sorry to hear that.

10:37.940 --> 10:39.507
Um...

10:40.776 --> 10:42.710
Reporters...

10:42.778 --> 10:44.811
They keep coming to my door

10:44.879 --> 10:47.314
and asking me
how I feel about...

10:47.382 --> 10:50.058
The man who killed my daughter,

10:50.178 --> 10:51.971
and he might be on the loose again,
and, um, you know...

10:53.997 --> 10:55.990
After Sara died and all through
the investigation,

10:56.110 --> 10:58.556
you were always straight with me,
and I just need to know, you know...

10:58.852 --> 11:02.221
I mean, what they're saying,
is it true?

11:02.341 --> 11:04.582
I mean... is he back?

11:04.583 --> 11:06.218
Yes.

11:07.486 --> 11:09.454
Cal, we got leads.
We got good leads.

11:09.522 --> 11:11.890
And we... we're doing all we can
to chase 'em down.

11:11.958 --> 11:15.126
If we make an arrest,
you'll be the first to know.

11:15.193 --> 11:16.727
I promise you.

11:27.641 --> 11:30.109
Sara would've been 29
next week.

11:33.079 --> 11:36.482
Don't let him do this
to another family.

11:55.924 --> 11:57.191
Hey.

11:57.259 --> 11:59.293
Hey.
There's no news from C.S.U.

11:59.361 --> 12:01.829
on the nametag,
not that I was expecting any.

12:01.896 --> 12:03.964
It makes you wonder
why he didn't pull

12:04.032 --> 12:06.166
that whole gas leak routine
on Linda Russo.

12:06.235 --> 12:09.002
I know why.
The answer's in here.

12:09.070 --> 12:11.138
- A transcript?
- From four years ago.

12:11.206 --> 12:13.608
I took a look at calls made
to the triple killer tip line,

12:13.675 --> 12:15.610
and this one stood out for me.

12:15.677 --> 12:18.112
It's from May 21, 2006,

12:18.179 --> 12:20.141
which was a week after
the sixth murder.

12:20.241 --> 12:22.041
A woman called
and left a message,

12:22.109 --> 12:24.043
but she was too afraid
to leave her name.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.479
But she did mention that
she lived at 24th and 10th.

12:26.547 --> 12:28.446
Same corner as Linda Russo.

12:28.546 --> 12:30.783
She was riding an elevator
with a cable repairman

12:30.883 --> 12:32.417
who so creeped her out

12:32.485 --> 12:34.323
that she got off a floor early
just to get away from him.

12:34.423 --> 12:36.391
Yeah, but cable guy and creepy...
That's a job requirement.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.660
Except he wasn't a cable guy.

12:38.728 --> 12:41.262
She said he wasn't carrying
the right tools.

12:41.330 --> 12:44.265
And working for a cable company,
Linda Russo would know that.

12:44.333 --> 12:46.334
Which is why I took a look

12:46.402 --> 12:48.117
at Linda Russo's phone records
from four years ago.

12:48.217 --> 12:50.213
She's the one who made
the call to that tip line.

12:50.319 --> 12:52.020
So Linda Russo was special.

12:52.088 --> 12:54.868
When she got off a floor early,
he knew that she made him,

12:54.968 --> 12:56.027
so he dropped out of sight.

12:56.227 --> 12:58.985
Which also explains
why he attacked her outside.

12:59.085 --> 13:02.087
He knew there was no way she'd
let him into her apartment.

13:03.724 --> 13:05.533
Linda Russo saw his face,

13:05.633 --> 13:07.867
and he came back
four years later.

13:07.935 --> 13:09.895
That's a special kind
of ruthlessness.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.746
Yo. C.S.U. just got
a partial on that nametag.

13:12.814 --> 13:14.347
We got a match.

13:16.751 --> 13:18.651
The man we're looking for
is Marcus Gates...

13:18.719 --> 13:22.722
42, 6-foot tall, 180 pounds,
with light Brown hair.

13:22.789 --> 13:26.092
He also has a snake tattoo
running down his left arm.

13:26.159 --> 13:29.428
A print match ties him
to Kim Foster's murder.

13:29.496 --> 13:32.197
Now a prison psych evaluation
calls Gates "a brutal,

13:32.265 --> 13:34.967
highly intelligent sociopath."

13:35.035 --> 13:37.703
He's done time for manslaughter
and attempted murder.

13:37.771 --> 13:39.705
His last conviction
was for breaking a bottle

13:39.773 --> 13:42.675
over a man's head in a bar,
almost killing him,

13:42.743 --> 13:46.445
for which Gates served
four years in Sing Sing.

13:46.513 --> 13:49.247
He just got out last month.

13:49.314 --> 13:51.315
No known address, no family.

13:51.383 --> 13:53.351
His mother died
when he was 4 years old,

13:53.418 --> 13:56.187
and he was placed in a series
of Foster homes since then,

13:56.255 --> 13:58.156
so he will not be easy to find.

13:58.223 --> 14:01.592
Listen, four years ago, this guy
took the lives of six women

14:01.661 --> 14:03.194
because we didn't stop him.

14:03.262 --> 14:05.196
We know
who the triple killer is.

14:05.264 --> 14:08.432
We know he's out there
targeting his third victim.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.401
Let's get him

14:10.469 --> 14:12.470
before he gets her.

14:18.410 --> 14:20.274
Hey, dad.

14:20.773 --> 14:21.988
Hey.

14:22.088 --> 14:23.683
Must be quite a case if it's
keeping you out this late.

14:24.149 --> 14:26.217
Oh, you know, someone died,
someone else did it.

14:26.284 --> 14:28.786
Secret admirer?

14:28.854 --> 14:30.372
As a matter of fact, it is.

14:30.458 --> 14:31.462
You figure out who it was yet?

14:31.662 --> 14:33.562
I took your advice and decided
it's better not knowing.

14:33.677 --> 14:35.645
And he left another note
in my locker.

14:35.712 --> 14:37.780
He said if I like the rose,
I should show him

14:37.848 --> 14:38.856
by wearing it
at school tomorrow.

14:39.028 --> 14:40.528
Isn't that sweet?

14:40.596 --> 14:43.954
Well...
Is that a good idea?

14:44.680 --> 14:47.086
W-what would
your boyfriend Ashley think?

14:47.186 --> 14:50.088
I get a feeling it's not Ashley
who has the problem.

14:50.156 --> 14:53.491
I'm just not sure it's smart
to go wearing some flower

14:53.558 --> 14:55.493
when you don't know
who it's from.

14:55.560 --> 14:58.662
Your... your school is not exactly
Fort Knox, all right?

14:58.730 --> 15:00.330
Anyone could've put
that note in your locker.

15:00.430 --> 15:02.832
Your secret admirer could be
some... pervert

15:02.900 --> 15:05.534
watching you from afar
with high-powered binoculars.

15:07.187 --> 15:09.055
I'm going to bed now.

15:09.122 --> 15:11.090
Good night.

15:11.158 --> 15:12.659
Good night.

15:12.726 --> 15:14.661
Could you lock
your windows for me, please?

15:14.728 --> 15:16.830
<i>Yes.
Please.</i>

15:16.897 --> 15:18.731
I'm gonna check
and make sure they're locked.

15:20.345 --> 15:22.278
No, I had it all set up.
It was in this pile.

15:22.478 --> 15:23.899
I don't... I don't understand your system.
You're messing up my system.

15:23.900 --> 15:26.006
Hey, guys.
Any news on Gates?

15:27.608 --> 15:29.081
My system is efficient.

15:29.177 --> 15:29.955
And dumb.

15:29.978 --> 15:31.792
- I already went through this one.
- It's on your stack.

15:31.892 --> 15:33.728
- It's part of my system.
- Your system is dumb.

15:33.791 --> 15:35.162
So... nothing?

15:35.362 --> 15:37.760
No. We tracked down
an Uncle in Jersey,

15:37.860 --> 15:40.278
but he hasn't seen Gates
in 20 years.

15:40.378 --> 15:41.701
So I'm on the phone
with Sing Sing

15:41.801 --> 15:43.602
to chase down
prison associates.

15:43.670 --> 15:46.405
Detective Beckett,
you still there?

15:46.472 --> 15:49.341
Yes, I'm still here.

15:49.409 --> 15:51.376
Okay. And is he still
doing time?

15:51.444 --> 15:53.411
First-time drug offender.
Got it. Thanks.

15:53.478 --> 15:55.980
"Jelly Tyson"?

15:57.447 --> 15:59.514
It's "Jerry," Castle.

15:59.582 --> 16:01.083
When Gates got released,

16:01.151 --> 16:03.353
he gave all of us stuff
to Jerry Tyson, a fellow inmate.

16:03.354 --> 16:04.621
So if the two of them
were friends,

16:04.721 --> 16:07.388
Jerry might be able to tell us
where we can find Gates.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.193
Now it's "Jerry."

16:14.046 --> 16:16.481
I got three months left
in this hellhole.

16:16.549 --> 16:18.417
All I want to do is do my time,

16:18.484 --> 16:20.352
get out, and go see my girl,

16:20.420 --> 16:23.121
and it's never gonna happen
if Gates gets wind

16:23.189 --> 16:24.609
that I talked to cops.

16:24.709 --> 16:25.756
He won't.

16:25.857 --> 16:27.792
You don't know that.

16:27.859 --> 16:30.394
He's got reach in here.

16:30.462 --> 16:32.396
He'll have me taken out.

16:32.464 --> 16:34.732
Here's the deal, Jerry...
Whether you talk to us or not,

16:34.800 --> 16:37.234
I am willing
to sit here all day.

16:37.302 --> 16:38.969
So it's gonna look like...

16:39.037 --> 16:42.172
You were spilling
your guts to us.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.477
All right. But I want to be
back in my cell in two minutes.

16:44.577 --> 16:45.806
Fair enough.
Were the two of you friends?

16:46.006 --> 16:48.395
I guess.
Whatever that means in here.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.485
I work in the kitchen. I snuck him
fruit so he could make pruno.

16:52.685 --> 16:54.343
And in return,
he agreed to protect you?

16:54.472 --> 16:56.621
Yeah. Now he's gone, and I'm
in here, going it alone.

16:56.940 --> 16:59.275
Every con I've ever known
dreams of what he'll do

16:59.343 --> 17:00.544
and where he'll go
once he gets out.

17:00.547 --> 17:01.769
Gates ever talk to you
about that?

17:03.781 --> 17:06.738
I remember him talking about
some strip clubs, and, um,

17:07.891 --> 17:09.759
there's a place
he liked to go drinking. Um...

17:09.826 --> 17:11.560
In the meatpacking district.

17:11.628 --> 17:13.596
What was it called?

17:13.664 --> 17:15.431
H-hog something.

17:15.499 --> 17:17.098
Something about hogs.

17:20.036 --> 17:22.305
♪ I wore a tie
to the corporate feast ♪

17:22.373 --> 17:24.807
♪ I worked in the belly
of the fiscal beast ♪

17:24.875 --> 17:28.477
♪ I toed the line
for a 401(K) ♪

17:28.544 --> 17:32.248
♪ I've been deceived
in a million ways... ♪

17:32.315 --> 17:34.950
I just did some recon.
He's at the bar nursing a beer.

17:35.018 --> 17:36.718
- How many in there?
- Five total...

17:36.787 --> 17:39.321
Gates, the bartender,
a waitress, and two drunks.

17:39.389 --> 17:41.014
He may be armed.
We take him quick.

17:41.114 --> 17:42.347
Don't give him a chance
to take any hostages.

17:43.447 --> 17:44.647
It's him!

17:44.738 --> 17:47.139
Let me see your hands!
Let me see your hands right now!

17:47.207 --> 17:49.775
Let's see your hands right now!
Right now, let's see your hands! NYPD!

17:49.843 --> 17:51.877
Hands up! Put your hands up!
NYPD! Hands in the air right now!

17:51.944 --> 17:54.045
You heard the man!
Put your hands in the air

17:54.113 --> 17:56.347
and get on your knees
while you're at it!

17:57.567 --> 18:00.502
Wow. You brought out
the old guy, huh?

18:00.570 --> 18:02.661
That can only mean one thing.
You want me in a bad way, right?

18:02.761 --> 18:05.230
- Shut up.
- Hey, don't forget to read me my rights.

18:05.297 --> 18:08.600
Be a shame to get
turned loose on a technicality.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.635
Let's go.

18:10.702 --> 18:13.938
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say...

18:17.837 --> 18:19.704
Cold, implacable...

18:19.771 --> 18:22.306
The triple killer remains
at ease,

18:22.373 --> 18:24.308
calm in the lair of his enemy,

18:24.375 --> 18:26.409
with a resting heart rate
of 50,

18:26.477 --> 18:29.713
set to match wits
with his interrogators.

18:29.780 --> 18:32.149
I... just wanted to bring

18:32.217 --> 18:35.285
a literary flair
to the moment, you know.

18:35.353 --> 18:38.612
The bartender told us where Gates lives.

18:38.712 --> 18:41.146
He's had to put him in a cab
on more than one occasion.

18:41.214 --> 18:43.682
Ryan's got a warrant, and he's
searching his place right now.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.017
We can't count on circumstantial
evidence to carry this case.

18:46.085 --> 18:49.087
We need to get this guy
to run his mouth.

18:49.155 --> 18:51.323
The only hard evidence we have
on him is Kim Foster's murder.

18:51.391 --> 18:54.493
Pin him down on where he was
when she died.

18:54.561 --> 18:57.628
Castle...

18:57.696 --> 18:59.865
Not this time.

19:02.468 --> 19:05.636
Mr. Gates,
I'm Detective Beckett.

19:07.539 --> 19:09.140
Not my type.

19:09.208 --> 19:11.076
But...

19:11.143 --> 19:12.810
I would make an exception.

19:14.813 --> 19:16.447
Do you know Kim Foster?

19:20.819 --> 19:23.088
<i>Doesn't ring a Bell.</i>

19:23.155 --> 19:25.790
<i>Have you ever seen
this woman before?</i>

19:25.858 --> 19:28.325
Mm.

19:28.393 --> 19:30.227
She has nice hair.

19:30.295 --> 19:33.197
Have you
or haven't you seen her?

19:33.265 --> 19:35.499
Uh, New York City

19:35.566 --> 19:37.134
<i>is a big place.</i>

19:37.202 --> 19:38.414
<i>I mean, I could've passed her
on the street, I guess.</i>

19:38.514 --> 19:40.946
<i>I'm actually talking about
a more intimate interaction.</i>

19:41.046 --> 19:42.674
<i>Have you ever
been in her apartment?</i>

19:42.874 --> 19:44.700
<i>I've been to
a lot of apartments.</i>

19:47.037 --> 19:49.232
This building
is at 35th and 8th.

19:50.610 --> 19:52.278
She lived in 301.

19:52.578 --> 19:55.047
Were you ever
in that particular unit?

19:55.115 --> 19:57.850
- No. - Well, then perhaps
you can explain to me

19:57.918 --> 20:00.018
how we found this nametag

20:00.085 --> 20:03.789
with your fingerprint on it
lying next to her body.

20:03.856 --> 20:06.057
<i>As a matter of fact,
I can.</i>

20:06.125 --> 20:08.259
Can't wait to hear this.

20:08.328 --> 20:11.330
- I work at the Empire Prop House.
- And?

20:11.397 --> 20:14.533
And they rent props
for movies and TV shows.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.170
I know what a prop house is.

20:16.514 --> 20:18.349
So that's my job.
I stock props.

20:18.416 --> 20:21.151
There's tons of nametags
just like this one,

20:21.219 --> 20:23.320
and I bet I've touched
a hundred of 'em.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.589
- Run that down. See if he's for real.
- On it.

20:26.490 --> 20:28.224
<i>There's no record
of you having this job.</i>

20:30.125 --> 20:32.194
<i>They pay me
under the table.</i>

20:33.862 --> 20:37.098
Oh. Maybe you can get me
for tax evasion.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.000
This prop house
where you say you work,

20:39.068 --> 20:41.469
do they have uniforms there?

20:41.537 --> 20:43.672
- Sure.
- Like gas company uniforms?

20:43.739 --> 20:47.175
<i>Any kind of uniform
you can think of, they got it.</i>

20:47.243 --> 20:50.044
And have you ever taken
any of these uniforms home?

20:50.112 --> 20:53.281
Do you have any
in your possession?

20:53.349 --> 20:55.217
Are you guys
searching my place?

20:55.284 --> 20:57.419
Yes, so if there are
any uniforms there,

20:57.486 --> 20:59.487
you may as well tell me.

20:59.555 --> 21:03.023
Wow. I'm gonna want to see
the search warrant.

21:03.091 --> 21:05.459
What for?

21:05.527 --> 21:07.461
It's my legal right.

21:07.529 --> 21:10.130
<i>And I'm done talking
till you show it to me.</i>

21:10.198 --> 21:12.600
<i>So you better get with
affirmative action back there</i>

21:12.667 --> 21:15.236
<i>and come up
with a new game plan.</i>

21:15.303 --> 21:17.238
He wants the search warrant

21:17.305 --> 21:19.473
to get a peek at our cards.

21:19.541 --> 21:22.243
How is that giving him a peek?
The warrant lists ropes,

21:22.310 --> 21:24.578
uniforms, and other personal
effects belonging to Kim Foster,

21:24.646 --> 21:26.813
Linda Russo, and the other six
triple killer victims.

21:26.881 --> 21:29.716
By looking at the warrant, he can gauge
where we are in our investigation.

21:29.983 --> 21:32.716
That's not giving him a peek.
That's showing him our whole hand.

21:32.884 --> 21:34.952
- He'll know we think he's the triple killer.
- He already knows.

21:35.153 --> 21:36.553
Yo.

21:36.620 --> 21:39.456
Empire Prop confirmed that Gates
works in their warehouse

21:39.523 --> 21:41.424
and had access to those tags.

21:41.492 --> 21:44.294
He clocked out at 7:02 the night
of Kim Foster's murder.

21:44.362 --> 21:46.763
Now Empire is in Lincoln Square,
which means

21:46.831 --> 21:49.333
that he had enough time
to get to her apartment

21:49.400 --> 21:52.402
and push the intercom button
by 7:35.

21:52.470 --> 21:54.338
Show him the warrant.

21:54.405 --> 21:58.075
Odds are he will lawyer up,
but try to stop him.

22:03.046 --> 22:05.281
How is she supposed to do that?

22:05.349 --> 22:07.149
I don't think she can.

22:20.730 --> 22:22.711
Turns out you got
a lot more on your mind

22:22.811 --> 22:24.512
than just Kim Foster.

22:24.580 --> 22:27.482
I see the names
of seven other women here.

22:30.919 --> 22:32.120
Ryan.

22:32.187 --> 22:34.354
- Tell me you got something.
- Not so far.

22:34.422 --> 22:35.334
No rope, no uniform,

22:35.434 --> 22:36.539
nothing that ties him
to any of the victims.

22:36.739 --> 22:37.939
Keep looking.

22:38.371 --> 22:41.139
<i>The thing is, this nametag</i>

22:41.206 --> 22:43.275
<i>is the probable cause
for bringing me in.</i>

22:43.342 --> 22:44.942
But I've explained
the fingerprint

22:45.010 --> 22:47.612
and by now, I'm sure you've
checked out my story.

22:47.680 --> 22:49.481
Actually, we're still
verifying that.

22:49.548 --> 22:51.583
I know how this works.

22:51.651 --> 22:54.386
You do not have
probable cause to hold me.

22:54.453 --> 22:56.151
Is that right?
Can't we hold him?

22:56.251 --> 22:57.322
Only in the movies.

22:57.423 --> 22:58.507
So he can just walk outta here?

22:58.607 --> 22:59.591
Unless she catches him in a lie

22:59.692 --> 23:02.126
and gives her cause
to keep him.

23:03.729 --> 23:05.462
I want to leave now.

23:05.530 --> 23:07.197
<i>Okay. Fine.</i>

23:07.265 --> 23:09.032
<i>You can do that.</i>

23:09.100 --> 23:11.168
<i>The second that you lawyer up
and leave,</i>

23:11.235 --> 23:14.237
<i>you become the focus
of a major investigation.</i>

23:14.306 --> 23:16.449
<i>It will disrupt your life
in ways you can't even imagine.</i>

23:16.549 --> 23:17.541
<i>I'm already the focus.</i>

23:17.642 --> 23:21.044
Yeah? Well, you don't
have to be.

23:21.112 --> 23:24.047
Look, the truth is,
we don't have any evidence

23:24.115 --> 23:25.849
that connects you
to those murders.

23:25.917 --> 23:27.818
It all boils down
to Kim Foster.

23:27.885 --> 23:30.987
Even if your fingerprints got on
this nametag by accident,

23:31.055 --> 23:33.990
with your record, you still
look like a suspect to us.

23:34.058 --> 23:36.225
So Kim Foster's a problem
for you.

23:36.293 --> 23:38.227
<i>But you can get that problem
out of your way.</i>

23:38.295 --> 23:40.730
You said you've never been
to her apartment.

23:40.798 --> 23:43.866
Where were you
at 7:35 last night?

23:46.069 --> 23:47.970
What's in that for me?

23:48.038 --> 23:51.507
If your alibi checks out,
then we move on.

23:51.575 --> 23:53.443
We go after the real killer.

23:55.479 --> 23:58.414
I left work at 7:00.
I walked home like I always do.

23:58.482 --> 24:01.517
I got home, maybe 7:30,
and I stayed in all night.

24:01.585 --> 24:03.753
<i>And you're sure about that?</i>

24:03.821 --> 24:06.121
Absolutely.

24:07.757 --> 24:09.958
This is off of a traffic cam
across from Gates' apartment.

24:10.025 --> 24:12.260
Well, this is it. This will
prove that he was lying.

24:12.328 --> 24:14.830
At 7:35, he was on his way
to Kim Foster's apartment.

24:14.897 --> 24:17.332
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

24:17.400 --> 24:20.201
Back... Stop. Stop. Stop there.

24:20.269 --> 24:22.637
That's him. 7:31.

24:22.705 --> 24:24.506
No, that can't be.

24:24.574 --> 24:26.207
It is. Look.
Same sideburns...

24:27.910 --> 24:29.511
And there's his snake tattoo.

24:29.579 --> 24:31.880
Well, then he slipped out
the back and went to Kim's.

24:31.947 --> 24:34.583
How would he get from 101st
to Midtown

24:34.650 --> 24:37.918
and change clothes in...
Four minutes?

24:37.986 --> 24:40.721
I don't know, but he did it.
Can we enhance this video?

24:40.789 --> 24:41.831
You can enhance it
all you want.

24:41.931 --> 24:44.232
- Doesn't change the facts.
We gotta cut him loose. - Sir, I just...

24:44.333 --> 24:46.668
I don't like this any more
than you, Detective,

24:46.735 --> 24:49.571
but he alibis out.

24:49.638 --> 24:53.346
Well, looks like we had it all wrong.
You're free to go.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.234
With this triple killer fella
running around,

24:56.302 --> 25:00.371
you all better keep
your loved ones close.

25:02.274 --> 25:04.209
I sure hope you catch him.

25:06.045 --> 25:08.646
Put a surveillance detail
on him.

25:08.714 --> 25:10.547
I don't want
that son of a bitch

25:10.616 --> 25:12.516
out of our sight.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.974
Oh, don't you look adorable
this morning?

25:25.349 --> 25:27.283
I meet my secret admirer today.

25:27.351 --> 25:30.353
Oh, I can just picture
the scene.

25:30.421 --> 25:33.790
You and your secret admirer
agree to meet in the cafeteria.

25:33.858 --> 25:36.993
You scan the array of pimply
faces. Which one is his?

25:37.061 --> 25:39.028
Your secret admirer uses
the prearranged signal

25:39.096 --> 25:41.598
of a double helping
of mashed potatoes on his plate.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.567
He's... handsome,

25:43.634 --> 25:46.569
charming in an asexual,
nonthreatening kind of way.

25:46.636 --> 25:50.206
Nice try, but it'll be
so much more mysterious.

25:50.274 --> 25:51.807
Listen to this.

25:54.644 --> 25:58.047
"If you want to meet, I'll be
at Strawberry Fields at 5:00."

25:58.115 --> 25:59.983
"I hope you'll be there, too."

26:00.050 --> 26:02.418
No. No, no, no.
No, you're not going.

26:02.486 --> 26:05.141
Before you were practically
forcing me to find out who he is.

26:05.454 --> 26:07.255
Not in the park.
Not by yourself.

26:07.281 --> 26:08.379
But I've been there
a million times...

26:08.479 --> 26:09.679
Well, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

26:10.017 --> 26:11.984
The first note you got...

26:12.052 --> 26:13.620
"Rope of flaxen hair."

26:13.687 --> 26:16.088
"Rope"? "Flaxen"?
Flaxen is blonde.

26:16.156 --> 26:18.457
I'm a redhead.
You're totally overreacting.

26:18.525 --> 26:21.360
I'm meeting my secret admirer,
and that's all there is to it.

26:24.031 --> 26:25.831
Richard, darling, she's right.

26:25.899 --> 26:27.866
You are being
utterly irrational.

26:27.935 --> 26:29.735
It's like when I was doing,

26:29.803 --> 26:31.237
uh, "Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf?"

26:31.305 --> 26:33.339
And I thought my understudy
was trying to poison me.

26:33.407 --> 26:35.808
Oh, yeah. The daily blood tests
I paid for.

26:35.875 --> 26:38.110
Wait. She did poison you.

26:38.178 --> 26:40.612
The swiss chocolate she gave you
was a laxative.

26:40.680 --> 26:43.049
It added a certain urgency
to my performance.

26:43.116 --> 26:45.584
But the point is,
you indulged my paranoia.

26:45.652 --> 26:48.054
So therefore, I am going to
be in the park, 5:00,

26:48.121 --> 26:49.921
at a discreet distance
to make sure

26:49.989 --> 26:53.024
that Alexis' secret admirer
is not an ax murderer.

26:53.092 --> 26:55.493
Thank you.
You're welcome.

26:58.664 --> 27:01.299
Tell me you've arrested Gates.
Not even close.

27:01.367 --> 27:03.335
I mean,
I don't know how, Castle,

27:03.402 --> 27:06.771
but he killed Kim Foster,
and he's gonna do it again.

27:06.839 --> 27:08.861
There's been no developments?
Usually you call me with news.

27:11.610 --> 27:14.012
You called to seek my counsel.

27:14.080 --> 27:16.281
I wouldn't say it
exactly like that.

27:16.349 --> 27:17.849
No, no, no.

27:17.916 --> 27:20.384
You were hoping
I had some wild theory,

27:20.452 --> 27:22.586
some sort
of penetrating insight

27:22.653 --> 27:24.521
that would lead us
to a breakthrough.

27:24.589 --> 27:27.557
Well... do you?

27:29.660 --> 27:32.943
Nah! I got nothin'.
I just need some piece of evidence.

27:33.111 --> 27:35.012
I mean, someone that
he talked to, anything.

27:37.181 --> 27:40.250
What if Gates confided in Jerry
about the previous murders?

27:40.318 --> 27:41.276
Yeah, well, Jerry's not
gonna talk to us.

27:41.277 --> 27:42.913
He got beaten up
in the prison yard this morning,

27:43.013 --> 27:45.073
and he thinks that Gates
had something to do with it.

27:45.450 --> 27:48.218
Sounds like Gates is afraid
of what Jerry Tyson knows.

27:49.507 --> 27:51.696
Get the hell away from me.

27:51.742 --> 27:53.577
Listen, Jerry, we just need
a little more information

27:53.644 --> 27:55.211
on Marcus Gates.

27:55.279 --> 27:56.558
Don't you guys get it?

27:56.948 --> 27:58.474
I'm a dead man thanks to you.

27:58.574 --> 27:59.774
Not if we get you out.

27:59.823 --> 28:02.157
The D.A. has agreed
to get you an early release

28:02.257 --> 28:03.736
and police protection.

28:03.836 --> 28:05.137
Gates knows about
my girlfriend...

28:05.237 --> 28:06.771
Donna Gallagher.
He could get to her, too.

28:06.871 --> 28:10.206
Well, then we'll make sure
he doesn't.

28:10.275 --> 28:11.676
We gotta move on this, Jerry.

28:12.802 --> 28:14.402
Last chance.

28:17.017 --> 28:18.601
Okay.

28:18.701 --> 28:20.356
I'll do it.
I'll take the deal.

28:20.670 --> 28:22.204
We need to know...

28:22.272 --> 28:25.240
Did Gates ever talk to you
about attacking women?

28:25.973 --> 28:26.773
There was this one time.

28:26.783 --> 28:30.031
He told me about this chick,
um, Sara... down in Soho.

28:30.723 --> 28:31.816
That could be Sara Townsend.

28:32.016 --> 28:33.813
He told me about how he
busted into her place

28:34.054 --> 28:36.411
and things got outta control,
but it musta been pretty bad,

28:36.511 --> 28:38.638
'cause Gates said he was worried
that the cops were after him,

28:38.738 --> 28:40.605
so he busts a bottle
over this guy's head

28:40.673 --> 28:42.306
to get himself locked up.

28:42.375 --> 28:45.109
That way, he'd be
under the radar for a while.

28:45.177 --> 28:46.878
That's a good start.

28:46.945 --> 28:49.381
My name's Detective Ryan.

28:49.448 --> 28:51.583
I'm your new best friend.

28:51.650 --> 28:53.050
This motel's
under surveillance.

28:53.118 --> 28:55.753
For your own safety, you cannot
leave or use the phone.

28:55.820 --> 28:57.521
Right now, you and I

28:57.589 --> 29:00.524
need to go over everything
Gates ever said to you,

29:00.592 --> 29:02.993
even if it seems stupid
or unimportant.

29:03.060 --> 29:04.995
Jerry's story
squares with the facts.

29:05.062 --> 29:06.212
Sara Townsend
was Gates' sixth victim,

29:06.312 --> 29:07.262
and she lived in Soho.

29:07.362 --> 29:08.562
What about assault
with a deadly bottle?

29:08.748 --> 29:10.426
That fits, too. It came
a week after Sara's death.

29:10.721 --> 29:12.866
Looks like Gates sent himself
up the river on purpose.

29:12.966 --> 29:14.247
It's still not enough
to arrest him, is it?

29:14.347 --> 29:15.969
No, but if Jerry has
more tidbits like that,

29:16.069 --> 29:17.501
it may help us get there.

29:17.601 --> 29:19.355
Yo, we can't locate
Donna Gallagher,

29:19.455 --> 29:20.663
and she's not
picking up her cell.

29:20.763 --> 29:21.817
Sir, where is Gates now?

29:21.917 --> 29:22.865
At his apartment.
Surveillance says

29:22.965 --> 29:23.843
he hasn't left the building.

29:23.943 --> 29:25.032
Contact Donna's
friends and family.

29:25.133 --> 29:27.546
Find out where she is.
I told Jerry we'd keep her safe.

29:27.646 --> 29:28.846
All right.

29:31.023 --> 29:32.341
Can't you just arrest this guy?

29:32.436 --> 29:33.923
I mean, you know he did
these things.

29:34.023 --> 29:36.479
He has an alibi. We can't
put him at the murder scene.

29:38.659 --> 29:41.862
He used partners sometimes.
You know that, right?

29:41.930 --> 29:43.897
Partner?

29:43.965 --> 29:45.933
We never ran across anything
about a partner.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.203
Oh, yeah. He said a-a partner
helps him get away with things.

29:49.270 --> 29:51.004
Though I-I get the idea

29:51.072 --> 29:52.973
he never used
the same partner twice.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.709
Jerry said
that Gates used a partner.

29:57.544 --> 29:59.879
A partner.
That's why he has an alibi.

29:59.947 --> 30:01.218
Tell your guys to arrest Gates.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.208
- I know how he killed Kim Foster.
- Okay.

30:04.328 --> 30:06.061
Gates said

30:06.129 --> 30:09.089
he walks home every night
at the same time, right?

30:09.427 --> 30:11.629
So this traffic cam footage
from the day be...

30:11.671 --> 30:12.948
Wait. There he is.
There he is.

30:13.068 --> 30:15.987
Okay. That's Gates on the right
the night of Kim Foster's murder.

30:16.107 --> 30:18.243
On the left, Gates from
a night earlier.

30:19.003 --> 30:22.478
What's wrong with this picture?
He's too short.

30:22.598 --> 30:24.368
So either Gates shrank...

30:24.488 --> 30:26.782
Or this is his partner.
He wore Gates' clothing.

30:26.849 --> 30:30.346
Gates would've had access to wigs
and disguises from the prop house.

30:30.466 --> 30:33.075
- That's how Gates can be at
two places at once. - Wait.

30:33.723 --> 30:35.135
What's that?

30:35.391 --> 30:38.106
Uh, it's a reflection from...

30:38.599 --> 30:41.330
from s... from sweat! From sweat!
That's Sweaty von Sweats-a-Lot!

30:41.397 --> 30:44.070
That's Paul McCardle. That's why
he was watching Linda Russo.

30:44.190 --> 30:47.038
He's the partner.
He was working with Gates.

30:47.158 --> 30:50.605
- I'm gonna put an A.P.B. out on McCardle.
- You better add Marcus Gates to that list.

30:50.673 --> 30:52.641
- Sir?
- When officers busted in to his place,

30:52.709 --> 30:54.902
all they found was a rope ladder going
down to the rooftop

30:54.972 --> 30:57.640
of the building next door.
Gates is gone.

31:00.403 --> 31:02.265
Got uniforms
searching the area.

31:02.385 --> 31:05.173
- No sign of Gates.
- Maybe he's going after Donna.

31:05.241 --> 31:07.922
- That way he could punish Jerry, too.
- We got any leads on her whereabouts?

31:08.042 --> 31:09.944
Esposito's talking
to her friends right now,

31:09.998 --> 31:11.027
but she's still in the wind.

31:11.147 --> 31:14.082
So is Paul McCardle.
His car is gone, and he is, too.

31:14.150 --> 31:16.062
Ex-wife has no idea
where he is either.

31:16.182 --> 31:18.481
But I did find out
how he and Gates are connected.

31:18.749 --> 31:21.914
- They were in a foster home together.
- So McCardle could be with Gates.

31:22.209 --> 31:25.443
Get photos of Gates and McCardle
to airport, bus, and train stations.

31:26.628 --> 31:28.804
Beckett.

31:28.924 --> 31:31.308
One of Donna's neighbors just told me
she's house-sitting at her cousin's.

31:31.428 --> 31:32.350
Do you have an address?

31:32.470 --> 31:35.104
Yeah, but so does Gates.
Some guy dressed as a messenger

31:35.224 --> 31:38.119
- said he had a delivery for Donna.
- Get there now.

31:39.105 --> 31:40.779
NYPD!

31:42.406 --> 31:44.731
Get off! Get off her!
Aah!

31:46.350 --> 31:48.683
I'd like to see you talk
your way out of this one.

31:50.135 --> 31:51.500
I'll try not to disappoint you.

31:52.201 --> 31:56.126
We found the same kind of rope in your
pocket as was used by the triple killer.

31:59.429 --> 32:02.562
Last I checked, a man's
allowed to carry rope.

32:04.508 --> 32:07.300
I think you wanted
to get caught, Marcus.

32:08.527 --> 32:12.739
There's nothing left for you out here,
but in prison, people fear you.

32:14.222 --> 32:15.924
You're a shot caller.

32:16.163 --> 32:18.105
And you wanted
to be king again.

32:19.829 --> 32:22.742
All's that left for you
to do is to clear the air

32:22.862 --> 32:24.950
of all these murders and
be done with it all.

32:33.857 --> 32:34.954
Nice try.

32:38.461 --> 32:41.875
- This guy is never gonna give it up.
- Sir, I need leverage and I don't have any.

32:41.943 --> 32:43.041
There's no witnesses.

32:43.106 --> 32:44.721
There's no proof that connects
him to any of the murders.

32:44.841 --> 32:47.197
The only thing that I've got him on
is an assault charge.

32:47.317 --> 32:49.659
Hey, we just got a hit on McCardle's A.P.B.

32:49.779 --> 32:52.218
- He's at St. Benjamin's hospital.
- Maybe Gates got to him.

32:52.286 --> 32:54.187
- Sir, if I can get McCardle to roll...
- Go!

32:54.255 --> 32:56.056
Yeah.
Uh, hey, um...

32:56.123 --> 32:58.791
Okay, fine, Castle, go.
Just stay out of his way.

32:58.859 --> 33:00.292
And, Ryan...

33:00.360 --> 33:02.462
Get me something
I can break him with.

33:05.306 --> 33:06.657
Excuse me.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.639
I'm Detective Ryan. We'd like
a word with Mr. McCardle.

33:09.759 --> 33:12.305
You can't have one.
He just got out of heart surgery.

33:12.643 --> 33:14.956
- What for?
- A congenital valve defect.

33:15.408 --> 33:17.743
Would that cause excessive
sweating, by any chance?

33:17.811 --> 33:19.745
Well, among other,
more serious symptoms.

33:19.813 --> 33:22.014
He's been in dire need
of surgery for over a year.

33:22.082 --> 33:24.350
- So why get it now?
- Well, he finally came up with the money.

33:24.417 --> 33:26.238
It's kind of
a costly procedure.

33:26.358 --> 33:28.601
- How costly?
- About $100,000.

33:28.721 --> 33:30.989
Uh...
Who footed the bill?

33:31.056 --> 33:33.024
That's
confidential information.

33:33.092 --> 33:35.827
You spoke to his ex-wife. She
didn't even know he was here.

33:35.895 --> 33:39.107
She hated the guy.
So who sent the flowers?

33:39.227 --> 33:40.499
Beckett.

33:40.566 --> 33:42.578
McCardle's surgery had
nothing to do with Gates.

33:42.698 --> 33:45.770
In fact, Gates sent him
get-well flowers.

33:45.838 --> 33:47.706
Which means he cares about
his foster brother.

33:47.773 --> 33:49.455
That's your leverage.

33:50.009 --> 33:51.675
You still need us to wait
and talk to McCardle?

33:52.411 --> 33:55.535
No. Tell Jerry
his girlfriend's fine,

33:55.655 --> 33:57.682
and he doesn't have to worry
about Gates anymore.

33:59.133 --> 34:00.784
You keep coming back for more.

34:00.852 --> 34:03.086
I look for that in a woman.

34:04.545 --> 34:07.309
We found Paul.
He's at St. Benjamin's.

34:07.429 --> 34:09.797
We know that he pretended to be you
the night of Kim Foster's murder,

34:09.826 --> 34:12.005
and I'm gonna get him
to testify against you.

34:13.498 --> 34:14.780
You don't know Paul.

34:14.900 --> 34:16.369
Well, then we'll go
another way.

34:16.931 --> 34:19.107
I'll charge him with accessory
to murder.

34:19.226 --> 34:21.972
- You can't do that.
- Actually, we can.

34:22.040 --> 34:23.585
Sing sing might have been
a picnic for you,

34:23.630 --> 34:26.612
but how long do you think
Paul is gonna survive in there?

34:34.045 --> 34:36.077
Paul didn't know
what was going on.

34:36.972 --> 34:38.745
He only did what I told him.

34:38.864 --> 34:42.382
The only way to prove that
is by telling me the whole story.

34:44.355 --> 34:46.920
Only if Paul gets immunity.

34:48.659 --> 34:50.377
And I want that in writing.

35:02.903 --> 35:04.262
Is that him?

35:05.511 --> 35:07.107
That's him.

35:09.786 --> 35:11.311
<i>Mr. Gates, did you kill
Kim Foster?</i>

35:14.914 --> 35:17.193
Yes. I killed all of them.

35:18.206 --> 35:19.163
<i>I want their names.</i>

35:19.466 --> 35:23.030
<i>Linda Russo, before that,
it was Sara Townsend,</i>

35:23.150 --> 35:25.112
<i>and five others.</i>

35:30.658 --> 35:32.177
Gates confessed to everything.

35:33.477 --> 35:34.749
We get to chalk one up
for the good guys.

35:34.869 --> 35:35.683
Why the long face?

35:36.436 --> 35:39.662
Because if this were a book,
I still wouldn't understand the operation.

35:39.782 --> 35:42.204
Valve replacement. It's no
big deal. My dad had one.

35:42.324 --> 35:44.495
Yeah, it is if you don't have the money.
Who paid for it?

35:44.615 --> 35:48.207
I'm guessing Gates did. Maybe he stashed
away some money from before prison.

35:48.255 --> 35:49.817
Yeah, but he was
out of prison for a month.

35:49.937 --> 35:52.484
Why wait till now to do
McCardle's operation?

35:52.552 --> 35:56.456
Well, he needed McCardle to help him
with Linda Russo and Kim Foster.

35:57.103 --> 35:58.144
Yeah, I guess.

36:00.025 --> 36:01.160
Packing up?

36:01.577 --> 36:03.461
Oh, just getting
my stuff together.

36:04.085 --> 36:07.615
- All that stuff from prison?
- Well, you accumulate a lot of stuff,

36:07.735 --> 36:09.036
you know, even in the slammer.

36:09.156 --> 36:11.875
You were right about Gates.
He did try to go after Donna.

36:11.902 --> 36:14.172
- But she's okay.
- And Gates?

36:14.292 --> 36:16.029
He confessed.
It's all over.

36:17.322 --> 36:18.417
Thank God.

36:19.460 --> 36:20.909
Aren't you gonna ask
what happened?

36:23.127 --> 36:25.814
To your girlfriend Donna...
you didn't ask about her.

36:25.846 --> 36:28.520
You just asked about Gates.
Doesn't make any sense, unless...

36:30.143 --> 36:31.437
She was supposed to die.

36:33.590 --> 36:35.037
I-I don't know what y...

36:35.157 --> 36:38.638
And McCardle didn't get the money for the
surgery until after you got out of prison.

36:39.328 --> 36:41.360
He's removing all evidence
he was even there.

36:41.480 --> 36:43.533
It was him all along.
He's the real triple killer.

36:43.601 --> 36:45.336
Ohh!

36:45.403 --> 36:46.670
Oh!

36:49.797 --> 36:51.119
Guilty as charged.

36:57.346 --> 36:59.082
- Excellent work, detective.
- Thank you, sir.

36:59.099 --> 37:01.865
I hope you say the same to
Castle. Where is he, by the way?

37:01.985 --> 37:04.786
- I thought that they would be back by now.
- Maybe he and Ryan went out for a cold one.

37:04.854 --> 37:07.256
After a day like today,
that's what I'm doing.

37:07.324 --> 37:09.683
- You care to join me?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.

37:09.803 --> 37:11.460
Then let's hit it.

37:15.311 --> 37:18.223
That story about Gates getting arrested,
that was your story, wasn't it?

37:18.865 --> 37:20.413
You were afraid
you were gonna get caught,

37:20.533 --> 37:23.269
- so you hid in prison.
- Too bad you didn't figure that out sooner.

37:23.389 --> 37:25.737
Too bad you didn't leave sooner.
The cops will be here any minute.

37:25.857 --> 37:28.152
Looks like Detective Ryan called
the precinct just before he got here.

37:28.272 --> 37:29.616
There won't be anybody
missing me for a while,

37:29.643 --> 37:31.542
and by the time they do, I'll be long gone.

37:31.662 --> 37:32.879
You won't get far.

37:33.723 --> 37:35.663
They already have your name,
know your face.

37:35.783 --> 37:37.298
I'll change those. Done that before.

37:37.754 --> 37:38.893
That's part of the fun of it.

37:39.013 --> 37:40.539
Fun like setting up Gates?

37:40.659 --> 37:43.757
Paul McCardle was the only person
in the world that he cared about.

37:43.877 --> 37:46.261
Once I learned that,
the rest was easy.

37:46.381 --> 37:47.845
You never know
when you'll need one of these.

37:48.295 --> 37:50.124
Besides, Gates liked prison.

37:50.244 --> 37:52.026
You taught Gates everything
he needed to know

37:52.146 --> 37:54.193
to take the fall
for the triple killer murders.

37:54.432 --> 37:56.420
After that, all you had to do
was pay for Paul's surgery,

37:56.540 --> 37:57.898
and you could
walk away scot-free.

37:58.018 --> 38:01.824
That's a beautiful plan...
Undone by a duffel bag.

38:02.190 --> 38:04.427
I'm not undone.
I'm right here.

38:04.547 --> 38:06.146
I'll relocate.
I'll start over.

38:06.213 --> 38:08.247
It must eat you alive,

38:08.315 --> 38:10.327
knowing that you came so close
to catching me.

38:10.447 --> 38:13.252
But this is
a winner-take-all type of game.

38:13.320 --> 38:15.055
Oh, Jerry.

38:16.109 --> 38:17.142
Shooting?

38:17.692 --> 38:18.946
It's not your style.

38:21.107 --> 38:22.584
Oh, you really don't know me
at all, do you?

38:22.704 --> 38:24.019
Oh, it's not complicated.

38:26.495 --> 38:28.183
You were raised
by a single mother.

38:28.968 --> 38:31.708
She was blonde.
Oh, she was beautiful.

38:32.833 --> 38:34.339
But... she never wanted you.

38:35.323 --> 38:36.875
When you were, what,

38:36.943 --> 38:39.945
12 I'm guessing,
she died suddenly.

38:40.013 --> 38:42.514
Let's say drug overdose.

38:42.582 --> 38:44.664
You go into foster care,
the bad kind.

38:46.525 --> 38:47.946
You have so much hate...

38:49.251 --> 38:51.980
So much hate towards your mother
for abandoning you...

38:52.740 --> 38:55.098
That you kill these women
to get back at her.

38:55.428 --> 38:56.810
But you leave them
looking peaceful,

38:56.854 --> 38:58.380
because as much
as you hated your mother...

39:00.007 --> 39:01.344
You loved your mother.

39:01.464 --> 39:02.835
Am I getting warm?

39:05.066 --> 39:07.936
You're drawn to death.

39:09.027 --> 39:12.305
You like to be around it
'cause it thrills you.

39:12.425 --> 39:14.311
Now where does that come from?

39:14.379 --> 39:17.584
Your own suppressed impulses?

39:21.954 --> 39:24.375
How close...

39:24.823 --> 39:26.188
To death...

39:26.792 --> 39:28.263
Do you want to get?

39:28.913 --> 39:30.183
Huh?

39:41.907 --> 39:43.273
Don't say anything
you shouldn't.

39:45.342 --> 39:46.542
Hello.

39:46.610 --> 39:48.578
Darling,
I just wanted you to know,

39:48.646 --> 39:51.648
your conspiracy theories
are completely unfounded.

39:52.506 --> 39:53.817
My conspiracy theories?

39:53.885 --> 39:54.985
Uh-huh.

39:55.052 --> 39:56.787
Alexis' secret admirer

39:56.854 --> 39:58.942
is Ashley, her boyfriend.

39:59.062 --> 40:00.391
Oh, that's great. Thanks.

40:00.511 --> 40:02.375
Yeah, and he's
a very charming young man.

40:02.495 --> 40:05.721
So anyway, no need to worry.
All's well that ends well.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.067
Richard?

40:10.468 --> 40:12.301
I love you.

40:15.706 --> 40:17.406
I don't think
there's anything more to say.

40:43.200 --> 40:46.401
Let's go.
Brad, take the back!

40:46.469 --> 40:48.570
On it!
Units, switch over to TAC-2.

40:48.638 --> 40:50.472
Clear the alley!

40:50.540 --> 40:52.975
Switch TAC-2. Copy.

40:53.043 --> 40:56.411
Ma'am, stay in your room.
Everybody, go back!

40:57.233 --> 40:59.245
- Castle?!
- Clear. He's gone.

40:59.498 --> 41:01.552
I'm fine.
Ryan needs an ambulance.

41:01.672 --> 41:03.985
- No, I don't.
- Hey, what the hell happened here?

41:05.316 --> 41:06.779
I'm so glad that you're okay.

41:06.899 --> 41:09.520
He's the triple killer.
He set Gates up to be a copycat.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.535
I know. I did the math

41:11.655 --> 41:13.800
when you and Ryan didn't come
back from talking to Jerry.

41:14.282 --> 41:15.716
How did you know to come here?

41:16.765 --> 41:17.721
Your mom called.

41:17.841 --> 41:19.359
She said that you told her
that you loved her,

41:19.382 --> 41:21.770
and she figured something
must be terribly wrong.

41:22.553 --> 41:23.720
I figured she might.

41:25.283 --> 41:26.808
Good girl.

41:38.449 --> 41:39.561
Here you go.

41:42.413 --> 41:43.991
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

41:47.747 --> 41:50.564
Tell me something, Castle.
Why did he let you live?

41:53.093 --> 41:54.435
To punish me.

41:56.075 --> 41:58.045
To make me pay
for ruining his plan.

42:01.543 --> 42:04.469
Now he's gonna kill again,
all because I couldn't stop him.

42:06.438 --> 42:08.196
And I feel so...

42:16.571 --> 42:18.274
I know the feeling.

42:20.406 --> 42:21.701
I know you do.
