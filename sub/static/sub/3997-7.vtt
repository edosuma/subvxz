WEBVTT

00:01.447 --> 00:04.149
Okay, gas, electric, and cable

00:04.217 --> 00:06.585
comes out to $219.34.

00:06.653 --> 00:07.853
Jessica?

00:07.921 --> 00:09.588
Do you have anything
to contribute?

00:09.656 --> 00:12.391
- Here we go.
- They're not all legal tenders,

00:12.458 --> 00:14.593
- but they have value, like...
- Sure.

00:14.661 --> 00:15.927
- That's $5.00.
- $5.00.

00:15.995 --> 00:17.328
Library card.

00:17.396 --> 00:19.397
- Library's not just for books any more.
- Mm-hmm.

00:19.464 --> 00:21.065
- Library card.
- Also, you can check out compact discs.

00:21.133 --> 00:22.901
- What else? This is a fortune.
- Um, yeah.

00:22.968 --> 00:25.503
"You are lucky and success."
How ironic.

00:25.571 --> 00:27.939
That's going right to the
gas company. "Paid in full."

00:28.007 --> 00:29.741
Jess, we can't keep
covering for you.

00:29.808 --> 00:31.075
Yes. I understand.

00:31.143 --> 00:32.308
It's just that, um...

00:32.375 --> 00:34.377
recently I went through a,
uh, life change

00:34.445 --> 00:35.712
where I was fired.

00:35.780 --> 00:36.947
Maybe I can borrow

00:37.015 --> 00:40.918
the money from my
good friend... Winston?

00:40.985 --> 00:43.219
You know, I really wish
I could, Jess, but, uh...

00:43.287 --> 00:45.722
I'm a single man now, so
basically I have to be able to

00:45.790 --> 00:49.458
trick women into thinking
that I can buy them stuff.

00:49.526 --> 00:50.359
Okay!

00:50.427 --> 00:52.862
Here is my share...

00:52.930 --> 00:55.297
to the penny.

00:55.365 --> 00:57.266
Yeah! I'm not the poorest!

00:57.333 --> 00:59.101
Second poorest.
Now you're the poorest.

00:59.169 --> 01:00.970
- That's gotta be rock bottom.
- Yeah, I got it.

01:01.038 --> 01:02.004
You know what?
I'm shutting off the gas

01:02.072 --> 01:03.172
until you can get me the money.

01:03.239 --> 01:04.471
- What?
- What are you talking about?

01:04.540 --> 01:06.474
Don't scapegoat me.
I just gave you my money.

01:06.542 --> 01:07.876
That's called tough love,
all right?

01:07.944 --> 01:09.310
No more handouts.

01:09.378 --> 01:10.812
Now, what are you
going to do about it?

01:10.880 --> 01:12.547
How are you gonna
pay the gas bill?

01:12.615 --> 01:13.782
- I don't know.
- I've got an idea.

01:13.849 --> 01:15.050
Get a job.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.384
The school year's
already started.

01:16.452 --> 01:17.752
I have a lot of
decisions to make

01:17.820 --> 01:18.920
as far as my résumé
is concerned.

01:18.988 --> 01:20.554
I have to choose a font,

01:20.622 --> 01:22.289
spacing, columns...

01:22.356 --> 01:24.758
Okay, just update
your résumé, you ninny.

01:24.826 --> 01:26.426
- Did you call me a ninny?
- Yeah, I called you a ninny,

01:26.494 --> 01:28.562
'cause you're acting
like a ninny, you ninny!

01:28.630 --> 01:30.731
Don't call me a ninny,
I'm PMSing!

01:30.799 --> 01:32.066
Ah! Why would you...
yucky! No, no, no.

01:32.133 --> 01:33.266
- I don't want to hear it.
- It hurts.

01:33.334 --> 01:34.534
I feel like I've
laid a million eggs

01:34.603 --> 01:35.702
and they're all hatching.

01:35.769 --> 01:37.637
I feel like I
want to murder someone,

01:37.705 --> 01:39.505
and also I want soft pretzels.

01:39.573 --> 01:41.040
You know what?
I feel the same way.

01:41.108 --> 01:42.642
Shut up!
Shut up, you!

01:42.710 --> 01:44.276
'Cause I don't want to hear it!

01:44.344 --> 01:45.344
I've had it!

01:45.412 --> 01:46.746
If any of you cross me,

01:46.814 --> 01:49.716
I'm gonna kick the testicles
clean off your body!

01:49.783 --> 01:52.417
Clean off! You'll look like
Ken dolls down there.

01:52.485 --> 01:54.119
Because that's where
I'm at right now.

01:54.186 --> 01:56.254
Now which one of you guys

01:56.322 --> 02:00.092
wants to tell me to get a job?

02:00.159 --> 02:01.359
Hmm?

02:01.427 --> 02:05.664
Who wants to look me in the face

02:05.732 --> 02:08.666
and tell me to get a job?

02:08.699 --> 02:10.199
Whatever.

02:11.268 --> 02:12.870
"Whatever?"

02:12.938 --> 02:14.538
What does that mean, huh?
Whatever.

02:14.606 --> 02:16.974
It better mean,
"Whatever you say, Jess."

02:17.042 --> 02:19.276
I don't think it's fair
that women have an excuse

02:19.344 --> 02:21.646
once a month to act
irrationally angry

02:21.713 --> 02:23.813
when the rest of us have to
keep it together all the time.

02:23.881 --> 02:25.248
You're irrationally angry

02:25.315 --> 02:27.216
365 days a year, Nick.

02:27.284 --> 02:28.451
What are you talking about?

02:30.921 --> 02:32.756
I will push if I want to push!

02:32.823 --> 02:34.157
Come on!

02:36.727 --> 02:38.227
I hate doors!

02:38.295 --> 02:40.029
Really? Well, that's just
your personal opinion,

02:40.096 --> 02:41.329
'cause I don't
have anger issues.

02:41.397 --> 02:42.731
You guys think
I have anger issues?

02:42.799 --> 02:44.733
Well, I mean, I wouldn't
exactly call it an issue.

02:44.801 --> 02:46.301
An issue is something
you can fix.

02:46.369 --> 02:47.602
Been that way
since I can remember.

02:49.605 --> 02:51.273
This is some
watered-down nonsense.

02:51.340 --> 02:53.308
You're some no-good shysters!

02:56.712 --> 02:58.846
On an unrelated note, I've just
decided to take a walk.

03:00.049 --> 03:01.282
Fine! Leave!

03:02.885 --> 03:04.285
Now, if you'll excuse me,
gentlemen,

03:04.352 --> 03:06.788
I'm gonna go get a job,
like it's my...

03:06.855 --> 03:07.889
Job?
Shut up!

03:07.956 --> 03:10.391
♪ Who's that girl? ♪

03:10.458 --> 03:11.992
♪ <i>Who's that girl?</i> ♪

03:23.470 --> 03:25.739
Please don't do that, sir.
Please.

03:25.807 --> 03:27.807
I would love to sit
by myself right now.

03:29.509 --> 03:32.144
There's something real
creepy about you, pal.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.580
You want to get weird?
Let's get weird.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.854
You got a nice face.

03:43.456 --> 03:44.789
Anger problem?

03:44.857 --> 03:46.557
Living with them?
Are you kidding me?

03:46.625 --> 03:47.792
It's frustrating.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.060
It's like...
just get a job.

03:49.128 --> 03:50.394
I like your hat.

03:50.462 --> 03:51.730
I like how it's not
a team or a logo,

03:51.797 --> 03:53.231
it's just blue.

03:53.298 --> 03:55.967
Would you rather be covered in
fish scales or feathers?

03:58.604 --> 03:59.537
Scales?

03:59.605 --> 04:01.038
Wow, you weirdo.

04:01.106 --> 04:04.141
You want to see me
jump really high?

04:04.209 --> 04:05.675
Ha! Ah ha!

04:05.744 --> 04:07.577
I'm afraid of dying, man.

04:10.215 --> 04:11.715
Who am I?!

04:11.783 --> 04:13.416
The enemy is en-e-my.

04:13.484 --> 04:16.986
The enemy is
the <i>inner me.</i>

04:17.053 --> 04:18.387
Can you understand
a word I'm saying?

04:18.454 --> 04:20.723
You just nod at everything.

04:20.791 --> 04:22.358
I need to change.

04:22.425 --> 04:23.760
And you've showed me that.

04:23.827 --> 04:26.162
I have an anger problem.

04:26.230 --> 04:27.596
Thank you.

04:27.664 --> 04:28.664
Can I get a hug?

04:33.202 --> 04:34.702
- I've got a story for you guys.
- Ooh.

04:34.771 --> 04:36.204
I met someone at work.

04:37.606 --> 04:38.840
Emma Sharpe.

04:38.908 --> 04:40.108
Divisional VP of
all North America.

04:40.176 --> 04:41.810
Wh-What are you doing
in the break room?

04:41.878 --> 04:43.779
This break room is in
North America, isn't it?

04:43.846 --> 04:46.248
Sure. That means I'm the
Vice President of it.

04:50.485 --> 04:55.389
I am the Vice President
of everything in North America.

04:55.456 --> 04:57.224
That sounds like...
sexual harassment.

04:57.292 --> 04:59.326
Robby, there's a fine line
between sexual harassment

04:59.394 --> 05:01.796
- and something awesome.
- I thought you hated your co-workers.

05:01.863 --> 05:03.497
- You said they were a bunch of...
- Pant-suited corporate She-Hulks?

05:03.564 --> 05:04.831
Yeah, I know what I said.

05:04.899 --> 05:07.867
Emma is the craziest woman
to ever hit on me.

05:07.935 --> 05:09.703
Schmidt, you're
such a nice guy.

05:09.771 --> 05:11.505
- Thank you. - What you deserve
is a girl who respects you.

05:11.572 --> 05:13.039
- You know? A nice girl.
- Mm-hmm.

05:13.107 --> 05:15.208
I'm not into the nice thing,
Robby. Doesn't do it for me.

05:15.276 --> 05:16.576
- Well, that's what I thought, too.
- Yeah.

05:16.644 --> 05:18.378
You know, until I found, uh...
this one right here.

05:20.880 --> 05:21.547
You mean Cece?

05:21.615 --> 05:24.049
You think that I'm... nice?

05:24.117 --> 05:25.284
No.

05:25.352 --> 05:27.353
I think you're the nicest.

05:27.421 --> 05:29.121
- Mm.
- Hmm.

05:29.189 --> 05:31.256
Robby!

05:32.325 --> 05:33.824
Yes, the man just left.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.660
And he turned off the gas.

05:35.727 --> 05:37.028
Yeah, I'm refusing to
pay my gas bill

05:37.095 --> 05:38.062
as a matter of principle.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.328
You'd like me to
take the survey?

05:39.396 --> 05:40.797
Of course I'll
take the survey.

05:40.865 --> 05:42.331
- Schmidt?
- Yeah, hold on.

05:42.399 --> 05:43.900
Can I share some thing
with you, man to man?

05:44.001 --> 05:46.335
Oh, I'm...

05:47.605 --> 05:49.606
You have to promise me
you will not laugh.

05:49.674 --> 05:51.207
Look, I'm... you're not
talking to Nick, here.

05:51.275 --> 05:52.408
You're talking to Schmidt.

05:52.443 --> 05:53.943
Schmidt, I think
I'm getting my period.

05:58.281 --> 05:59.281
Okay.

05:59.348 --> 06:01.450
This is a real thing, okay?
I looked it up on the Internet.

06:01.517 --> 06:03.385
It's called, uh,
"sympathy PMS," right?

06:03.453 --> 06:04.787
Now, apparently this
is an affliction

06:04.854 --> 06:06.154
that men suffer from
all the time.

06:06.222 --> 06:07.189
Right on.

06:07.256 --> 06:09.124
I don't know
how it happened, man,

06:09.192 --> 06:13.795
but somehow, I got on that
woman's cycle of menstruation...

06:13.862 --> 06:15.496
and I got that menstruation
inside of me.

06:15.564 --> 06:16.731
Winston!

06:16.799 --> 06:18.332
Men can't get their periods.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.500
Where would they
put the tampon?

06:19.568 --> 06:20.935
Hey! Are you calling me stupid?

06:21.003 --> 06:22.269
You're the one
that's stupid, okay?

06:22.337 --> 06:23.504
You jack-faced butthole!

06:23.572 --> 06:24.739
Who's the jack-faced butthole

06:24.807 --> 06:26.607
who turned off the hot water?!

06:26.674 --> 06:27.874
Witch!
What have you done to my body?

06:27.942 --> 06:29.109
Shut up, you!

06:29.176 --> 06:31.078
Why is there no hot water?!

06:31.145 --> 06:32.345
Oh, I'm sorry, Jess.

06:32.413 --> 06:33.480
If you don't pay,
you don't play.

06:33.547 --> 06:35.048
You also don't shower.

06:35.116 --> 06:36.349
Are you serious?

06:36.417 --> 06:37.718
- Thank you, Denise.
- Hey, hey!

06:37.785 --> 06:38.952
Hey, great buddies.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.186
- Ow, my skin!
- Okay.

06:40.254 --> 06:41.822
- Roommates... hey, buddy.
- Don't poke me.

06:42.389 --> 06:45.591
Something wonderful
happened to me today,

06:45.659 --> 06:47.760
and I am no longer angry.
It's gone.

06:47.828 --> 06:49.461
Oh, shut up, Nick.

06:49.529 --> 06:50.696
So let me get this straight:

06:50.764 --> 06:51.831
Nothing at all's
going to set you off?

06:51.898 --> 06:52.832
That's right.

06:52.899 --> 06:54.166
Nothing's gonna get to me,

06:54.234 --> 06:55.567
'cause it's a new Nick Miller.

06:55.636 --> 06:57.870
Awesome. Hey, Winston,
tell him what you have.

06:57.938 --> 07:00.171
Sympathy PMS.
It's a real thing, I looked it up.

07:00.239 --> 07:01.439
- Sympathy PMS? What's that?
- No!

07:01.507 --> 07:02.907
PMS is mine!

07:02.975 --> 07:04.408
Stop stealing my stuff, Winston.

07:04.476 --> 07:05.543
You're telling me you're having

07:05.611 --> 07:06.845
a pre-menstrual
something right now?

07:06.912 --> 07:08.780
- Yes.
- Okay.

07:08.848 --> 07:10.414
It's like a character
in a Judy Blume novel.

07:10.482 --> 07:11.582
No! You can't have my menzies.

07:11.651 --> 07:12.784
He's got her menzies.

07:12.852 --> 07:14.152
No part of this conversation

07:14.219 --> 07:15.485
is making me want to
boil over with rage.

07:15.553 --> 07:18.756
I feel really good, guys.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.493
Hey, gang, why is
the water so cold?

07:23.561 --> 07:25.029
Schmidt turned off
the hot water,

07:25.096 --> 07:26.396
because it's not enough that
I have to go on an interview

07:26.464 --> 07:27.531
with the red devil in my belly,

07:27.598 --> 07:29.767
I also have to go unshowered.

07:29.834 --> 07:31.768
there's
no hot water in the whole house?

07:31.835 --> 07:33.102
Yeah.

07:33.170 --> 07:34.170
Seems strange.

07:34.237 --> 07:35.838
Maybe a cold shower
will wake you up

07:35.906 --> 07:37.807
to some harsh financial
realities, Jessica Day.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.576
You don't control my heat,
Theodore P. Gasbag.

07:40.644 --> 07:41.678
This is good!

07:41.745 --> 07:42.679
We got a lot of
feelings going around.

07:42.746 --> 07:43.680
A lot of anger.

07:43.747 --> 07:45.281
And you. You...

07:45.348 --> 07:46.748
You're suddenly calm?

07:46.816 --> 07:48.016
- Yeah.
- Really?

07:48.084 --> 07:50.451
It feels like a fat man's
sitting on my uterus.

07:50.519 --> 07:51.619
I hear that.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.223
Gonna go to the store!

07:55.291 --> 07:56.524
Does anybody want anything?!

07:56.592 --> 07:58.694
Thank you, Denise.

08:00.930 --> 08:01.930
Hey, you wanted to see me?

08:01.998 --> 08:03.998
Shut the door.

08:04.866 --> 08:05.666
Whoa.

08:05.734 --> 08:07.935
Quick reflexes. Good.

08:08.503 --> 08:11.572
I am going to devour you.

08:11.639 --> 08:13.873
- You see that contract?
- Oh, the thick one?

08:13.941 --> 08:15.309
With all those tabbies?

08:17.713 --> 08:18.512
Do me on it.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.214
Pick that up.

08:20.281 --> 08:22.982
Did you just ask me to pick
it up to see me bend over?

08:23.050 --> 08:23.817
No.

08:24.384 --> 08:27.087
Oh, wait, I'm doing it.

08:27.154 --> 08:28.555
Stand up.

08:29.824 --> 08:31.091
What is this thing?

08:31.158 --> 08:32.192
You're gonna have to sign it

08:32.260 --> 08:33.227
before anything
can happen between us.

08:33.294 --> 08:34.628
"Party A
absolves Party B

08:34.696 --> 08:36.629
"of any
psychological trauma,

08:36.697 --> 08:38.864
whether temporary, permanent,
future or imagined."

08:38.932 --> 08:40.499
After we do what we do,
you're gonna want to talk.

08:40.567 --> 08:41.734
I can't allow that.

08:41.801 --> 08:43.802
The less risk I incur,
the more I can focus on

08:43.870 --> 08:45.804
creating a viable sexual
experience for both of us.

08:46.572 --> 08:48.774
You're gonna want
to sign it.

08:48.842 --> 08:50.843
"Possible exposure
to lead paint."

08:50.910 --> 08:52.877
Do I have a
latex allergy?

08:52.945 --> 08:53.945
That's very important.

08:54.012 --> 08:55.513
"Guaranteed
mercury poisoning"?

08:55.581 --> 08:56.481
Mm.

08:56.549 --> 08:57.249
Is this real?

08:59.518 --> 09:02.053
You have till week's end
to sign it.

09:03.989 --> 09:05.422
What is your name?!

09:05.490 --> 09:07.391
I can't keep
thinking of you

09:07.459 --> 09:09.159
as my magical best
friend with no name.

09:09.227 --> 09:11.828
Joe. Tommy.

09:11.896 --> 09:14.097
Louis. Tran.

09:14.165 --> 09:16.800
Is it Tran?

09:18.435 --> 09:19.669
What a crazy guess!

09:19.737 --> 09:21.704
Beautiful name.
Fits you perfectly.

09:21.773 --> 09:24.273
My roommates
are killing me.

09:27.110 --> 09:28.177
Fine, you're right.

09:28.245 --> 09:29.544
Okay, I like
them, all right?

09:29.612 --> 09:31.280
I hate myself. Is that
what you want me to say?

09:31.347 --> 09:34.150
Why do you always have to
make everything so simple?!

09:34.217 --> 09:35.818
How do you
just get it?

09:35.886 --> 09:37.319
How do I become you?

09:37.387 --> 09:38.821
Show me the way, man.
I'll do anything.

09:44.093 --> 09:45.559
All right,
man, I'm in.

09:45.627 --> 09:48.096
You lead, my man.

09:48.164 --> 09:50.799
All right, whatever is about
to happen's gonna happen.

10:08.817 --> 10:11.518
Jessica Day?

10:11.585 --> 10:13.152
So why do you want
to teach adults?

10:13.220 --> 10:15.754
I think it's really inspiring
that these people have chosen

10:15.823 --> 10:17.023
to go back to school,
you know,

10:17.090 --> 10:19.158
that they want to read
<i>To Kill A Mockingbird,</i>

10:19.226 --> 10:20.159
- that they want...
- Oh!

10:20.227 --> 10:22.628
I named my dog Boo after...

10:22.696 --> 10:23.996
After Boo Radley?

10:24.064 --> 10:24.897
- Exactly.
- That's amazing.

10:24.965 --> 10:26.465
Oh, my God.

10:26.533 --> 10:27.533
She was a puppy.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.733
She's so cute.

10:28.801 --> 10:30.101
I know.

10:30.169 --> 10:31.636
Such a cutie.

10:41.347 --> 10:44.548
This cup is so tiny.

10:44.615 --> 10:46.817
So cute.

10:46.885 --> 10:48.618
Sorry, how did
she fit in the cup?

10:48.686 --> 10:49.920
I just don't understand.

10:49.988 --> 10:53.090
Just physically,
how did she get so small?

10:53.158 --> 10:55.860
I'm sorry, um...

10:55.927 --> 10:57.394
I'm sorry, I got this...

10:57.462 --> 10:58.762
I don't know what's wrong.

10:58.830 --> 11:00.063
So weird.

11:00.130 --> 11:02.531
Never happens to me.

11:02.599 --> 11:03.566
She's really cute.

11:03.633 --> 11:04.667
Yes, she was.

11:11.342 --> 11:13.309
Did she die?

11:13.377 --> 11:14.410
It's fine.

11:14.478 --> 11:15.611
It's been two years.

11:23.820 --> 11:27.490
Puppy...

11:27.557 --> 11:30.626
in a...

11:30.694 --> 11:32.361
cup.

11:36.098 --> 11:37.499
So...

11:37.566 --> 11:39.801
we're both dog people, right?

11:43.189 --> 11:44.924
Schmidt, am I nice?

11:44.992 --> 11:46.792
- No.
- Thank you.

11:47.862 --> 11:50.095
Nobody thinks
I'm a nice girl, okay?

11:50.163 --> 11:51.096
I'm the mistake.

11:51.164 --> 11:52.798
Ah, Robby.

11:52.866 --> 11:55.300
Midwestern heart,
Midwestern body.

11:55.368 --> 11:56.569
I'm the one
who messes things up.

11:56.637 --> 11:57.769
I agree with you.

11:57.837 --> 11:59.704
I feel like
he doesn't even know me.

12:01.641 --> 12:03.041
You're getting your smell
all over the comforter.

12:03.108 --> 12:04.409
Oh, my God.

12:04.476 --> 12:06.377
Took me months to get rid of
that heavenly curry smell.

12:06.445 --> 12:07.612
What happens
when he realizes

12:07.680 --> 12:09.848
he was wrong about
me the entire time?

12:09.916 --> 12:10.982
He's just
gonna run away.

12:11.050 --> 12:12.651
I would, I would
never run away from you.

12:14.318 --> 12:16.520
But if I did, I would run
way faster than Robby.

12:17.956 --> 12:19.657
'Cause he's slow.

12:19.724 --> 12:20.758
And I'm fast.

12:24.029 --> 12:27.130
Maybe I'm just not meant for
a functional relationship.

12:28.198 --> 12:29.232
You know me, Schmidt.

12:29.300 --> 12:31.701
You don't ever
have to be nice around me.

12:31.769 --> 12:33.436
I'm not scared of you.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.438
I mean, I'm bad.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.374
I do...

12:38.442 --> 12:41.243
I do bad things.

12:41.311 --> 12:42.411
I don't think
you're a nice girl.

12:43.781 --> 12:45.347
Think you're the worst.

12:53.422 --> 12:54.355
No.

12:54.423 --> 12:55.523
No...?

12:55.592 --> 12:58.126
No. I can't do
this to Robby.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.128
But you're a bad person.
We discussed that.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.563
- You're a bad person,
I'm a bad person. - Yep.

13:01.630 --> 13:03.430
We can totally do this.
No qualms.

13:03.498 --> 13:05.199
- I have a qualm. I have a qualm.
- You don't have a qualm.

13:05.266 --> 13:06.433
We sold our qualms,

13:06.501 --> 13:07.969
and we used the profits
to buy perfect bodies.

13:08.036 --> 13:10.137
- Robby is right.
- Hmm.

13:10.205 --> 13:12.473
- I'm nice.
- I'm not nice, all right?

13:12.540 --> 13:15.175
And I like Robby, but that is
doing nothing right now

13:15.243 --> 13:17.277
from stopping me
from wanting to kiss you.

13:17.345 --> 13:18.544
Stop, stop,
stop, stop.

13:18.613 --> 13:20.046
But I-I don't want to stop.

13:20.114 --> 13:21.147
I really don't.

13:21.215 --> 13:22.949
I will never stop
wanting to kiss you.

13:23.017 --> 13:26.319
I am a monster.

13:26.386 --> 13:27.821
I got to go.

13:27.888 --> 13:29.222
Yeah, sure.
Have fun.

13:29.289 --> 13:31.057
Thank you. I really
needed this.

13:31.125 --> 13:32.025
Mm-hmm.

13:39.865 --> 13:41.033
And I...

13:45.571 --> 13:48.140
I'm a monster.

13:49.207 --> 13:50.374
Okay.

13:50.442 --> 13:52.409
What is this place?

13:52.477 --> 13:55.212
What are you...?

13:55.280 --> 13:56.881
What would you like?

13:56.949 --> 13:58.116
What does this mean?

13:58.183 --> 14:00.118
Let's not do this.

14:00.185 --> 14:02.486
Let's not take off
our clothes.

14:02.554 --> 14:04.822
Let's go back to the park
where it was good...

14:12.263 --> 14:14.131
What do I know?

14:17.434 --> 14:20.137
We're taking our pants off?

14:22.173 --> 14:24.240
Okay. Keep those underwear on,
am I right?

14:24.308 --> 14:26.042
Yeah.

14:26.109 --> 14:28.144
Stay on.
Underwear good.

14:33.450 --> 14:36.118
Why are you cradling me
like a baby, friend?

14:36.187 --> 14:38.853
This is not how guys
of my generation hang out.

14:38.921 --> 14:42.257
This is a moment
that got away from me, man.

14:47.230 --> 14:49.198
Oh, that's my butt.

14:49.265 --> 14:51.400
This is intimate.

14:54.670 --> 14:56.971
How did you know?

15:02.311 --> 15:04.312
You are a huge baby.

15:04.379 --> 15:06.880
Yeah, I am.

15:06.948 --> 15:11.050
I am a huge baby.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.385
Forget it, I'm done.

15:12.453 --> 15:13.853
I'm not getting
a teaching job.

15:13.921 --> 15:14.787
- Mm.
- Just can't go

15:14.855 --> 15:16.223
back out there, you know?

15:16.290 --> 15:17.557
Oh, I feel you, Jess.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.092
I took a sick day.

15:19.159 --> 15:21.928
I just stayed at home and did
a watercolor of mountains.

15:21.995 --> 15:23.996
So you gonna get this,
like, every month?

15:24.064 --> 15:25.665
I mean, it's a possibility
from all the information

15:25.733 --> 15:26.833
that I've read on the Internet.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.534
That women like you

15:28.602 --> 15:30.236
- are the alpha.
- What?

15:30.303 --> 15:32.839
You're like the powerful moon,
and all the women in your life

15:32.906 --> 15:35.608
are just latched on
to your cycle.

15:35.675 --> 15:38.477
In my case, grown-ass man.

15:39.045 --> 15:41.814
Oh, yeah, good news.

15:41.882 --> 15:43.181
The gang's all here.

15:43.249 --> 15:44.216
Guys just PMS-ing?

15:44.283 --> 15:45.416
Not in the mood today.

15:45.484 --> 15:46.651
Don't really feel like
being yelled at,

15:46.719 --> 15:48.220
so what I'm gonna do
is go ahead and leave,

15:48.287 --> 15:49.420
because right now I'm
feeling very fragile.

15:49.488 --> 15:50.388
I understand.

15:50.456 --> 15:51.489
What's wrong with you?

15:51.557 --> 15:52.657
I'm no longer angry!

15:52.725 --> 15:53.892
All the anger

15:53.960 --> 15:55.293
that used to be
inside of me is gone!

15:55.361 --> 15:56.427
It's gone, it's gone!

15:56.495 --> 15:59.196
This is the worst thing
I've ever seen.

16:01.066 --> 16:02.800
- What is wrong with you?
- No.

16:02.868 --> 16:04.168
Period's got you down?

16:04.236 --> 16:05.702
That is such
a raw deal.

16:05.771 --> 16:07.138
Want me to get you
a sanitary napkin?

16:07.205 --> 16:08.272
Ew!

16:08.339 --> 16:09.473
Okay, I won't
get that.

16:09.540 --> 16:11.041
But you're okay
with pads or tampons

16:11.109 --> 16:12.476
or whatever it is
that you're using?

16:13.544 --> 16:15.611
Tell me about your day, please.

16:15.679 --> 16:17.113
I want to get into
your universe.

16:17.181 --> 16:18.815
Let's rap it out. Go.

16:18.883 --> 16:20.850
Floor is yours, pal.

16:20.918 --> 16:22.018
Talk, talk, talk.

16:22.086 --> 16:23.352
I want to listen.

16:23.420 --> 16:25.388
- No.
- 30 seconds of direct eye contact?

16:25.455 --> 16:27.023
Stop it, Nick. Please, stop.

16:27.091 --> 16:28.124
In three seconds,
I'll be silent.

16:28.192 --> 16:30.026
One, two...

16:30.794 --> 16:32.795
I bombed all my interviews.

16:32.862 --> 16:34.263
What? What happened?

16:34.330 --> 16:36.999
I was sabotaged by my baby box,

16:37.066 --> 16:38.466
which means I'm never

16:38.534 --> 16:40.002
gonna trust anything
that comes out of it.

16:40.069 --> 16:42.070
So that rules out a family.

16:42.138 --> 16:44.439
I know just the thing you need.

16:44.507 --> 16:45.607
Come with me.

16:46.942 --> 16:49.677
Welcome to the wonderful world
of water massage.

16:56.418 --> 16:59.486
You are a piece of seaweed.

16:59.554 --> 17:00.587
You are totally happy.

17:00.655 --> 17:02.389
Ow!

17:02.457 --> 17:03.723
- I don't mean to touch your boobs!
- You're touching my boobs!

17:03.791 --> 17:04.624
I don't mean to
touch your boobs!

17:04.692 --> 17:05.892
Fail, fail, fail.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.060
The next move is...

17:07.127 --> 17:08.261
Oh, my...!

17:08.329 --> 17:10.762
Relaxing is important.
Relaxing is important.

17:14.535 --> 17:16.368
Relax!

17:16.436 --> 17:17.603
Oh, no.

17:17.671 --> 17:19.038
What are you trying to do?!

17:19.105 --> 17:20.071
Kill me?!

17:20.140 --> 17:21.740
It worked for me.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.142
I was trying to help you.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.178
I've been watching you
doubt yourself for months.

17:26.246 --> 17:27.213
I'm not doubting myself.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.580
You're doubting yourself, Jess.

17:28.648 --> 17:29.548
No, Nick, it's PMS.

17:29.615 --> 17:32.084
It's not PMS.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.886
You got knocked down.

17:33.954 --> 17:35.386
It's time to get back up.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.722
And get up long enough for
one of these bozos to hire you.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.559
I believe in you.

17:42.828 --> 17:43.661
So does that guy.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.130
Hey.

17:46.198 --> 17:47.631
Think you can do that?

17:47.699 --> 17:51.201
And if you don't, I'm gonna
water massage you again.

17:51.269 --> 17:52.535
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

17:52.603 --> 17:53.737
Can you do that?

17:53.804 --> 17:54.905
Yes!

17:56.875 --> 17:58.475
Jessica Day?

17:58.542 --> 18:00.944
- Yes, I'm here.
- Weren't you here the other day?

18:01.012 --> 18:02.579
Weren't <i>you</i> here the other day?

18:03.646 --> 18:04.981
Yes, I was.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.738
Well, I signed it.
Please note the added provision.

18:10.806 --> 18:13.207
In any autobiographical
account of my life,

18:13.274 --> 18:16.143
you want to be referred to
as Moises Perdue.

18:16.211 --> 18:17.978
Non-negotiable.

18:18.046 --> 18:20.180
But you're fine
with the rest of it?

18:20.248 --> 18:22.916
Look, I'm a depraved freak,
and I want to wander into

18:22.984 --> 18:25.119
your Narnia of sexual terror

18:25.186 --> 18:27.787
and emerge
like a freshly birthed calf.

18:28.355 --> 18:29.222
Put your hands out.

18:29.289 --> 18:31.190
Let's do this.

18:32.326 --> 18:33.359
Are you ready?

18:36.196 --> 18:37.797
I'm ready.
All right.

18:37.865 --> 18:38.732
Oh, yeah.

18:40.399 --> 18:41.167
Okay.

18:41.235 --> 18:42.002
Interesting technique.

18:44.004 --> 18:45.070
Hold tight.

18:45.138 --> 18:47.205
I mean, I could totally
get out of this.

18:47.273 --> 18:49.008
What, have you never
bound somebody before?

18:49.075 --> 18:50.208
I got to start over.

18:50.276 --> 18:51.143
This your first time?

18:54.946 --> 18:56.248
Are you rejecting me?

18:56.315 --> 18:57.882
No, I-- no.

18:57.950 --> 18:59.251
I mean...

18:59.318 --> 19:02.987
Because legally...
you can't.

19:05.957 --> 19:07.358
Now take off
your pants.

19:07.926 --> 19:08.559
Okay.

19:08.626 --> 19:09.527
Now.

19:09.594 --> 19:10.994
All right, all right.

19:13.298 --> 19:16.067
I got it. I got it.

19:16.134 --> 19:17.734
Right there. Oh.

19:17.802 --> 19:18.902
No, I got it.

19:18.970 --> 19:20.204
Hold on, I got it.

19:20.272 --> 19:23.139
I did it. I did it.

19:23.207 --> 19:24.207
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

19:24.275 --> 19:26.142
drumroll please.

19:27.578 --> 19:29.446
Cut! Cut, Nick!

19:29.513 --> 19:30.547
Snare drum.

19:30.614 --> 19:31.681
I shouldn't have to specify.

19:31.748 --> 19:33.515
- Jess, that was a cymbal.
- Cymbals are part of the drum kit.

19:33.585 --> 19:34.952
Yeah.

19:35.019 --> 19:36.652
Nevertheless, we are gathered
here today to celebrate

19:36.720 --> 19:39.722
the reemployment
of Jessica F. Day.

19:39.790 --> 19:41.624
- Not my middle initial.
- Who will once again

19:41.692 --> 19:44.594
be in the classroom, molding
the minds of children.

19:44.661 --> 19:47.597
Actually, I'm gonna be remolding
the minds of grown-ups,

19:47.664 --> 19:49.966
'cause I'm gonna be teaching
creative writing to adults.

19:50.033 --> 19:51.166
So, what, are you
gonna be, like,

19:51.234 --> 19:52.501
reading a bunch of
weirdos' writing?

19:52.569 --> 19:54.035
Well, I hope you like
stories about vampires

19:54.103 --> 19:55.269
- and bad childhoods.
- I do.

19:55.337 --> 19:56.838
- You're gonna get them.
- In any case,

19:56.906 --> 19:59.708
I think I speak for all of us
when I say that we are thrilled

19:59.775 --> 20:01.910
that you will once again have
a reason to shower daily.

20:01.978 --> 20:03.778
Yes.

20:03.846 --> 20:07.048
Now, let
there be gas.

20:07.116 --> 20:08.882
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

20:08.950 --> 20:10.618
Ah, yeah!

20:10.685 --> 20:13.053
- Gonna be hot water in six to ten
minutes, fool! What?! - Yeah!

20:18.727 --> 20:20.661
Schmidt! Schmidt!

20:20.729 --> 20:21.895
Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!

20:21.963 --> 20:23.163
- Where's Winston?
- Where is Winston?

20:23.231 --> 20:24.564
- Go get Winston!
- Where is he?

20:24.632 --> 20:26.666
Schmidt! Schmidt!
Schmidt! Schmidt!

20:26.734 --> 20:28.400
Schmidt! Schmidt! Schmidt!

20:28.468 --> 20:30.569
Schmidt! Schmidt!

20:30.638 --> 20:32.038
Come on, jump around with us.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.773
Come jump with us, Winston.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.474
Sleepy eyes.

20:35.542 --> 20:37.043
Hey.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.444
What's going on, man?

20:41.547 --> 20:43.515
I don't really have PMS.

20:43.582 --> 20:46.017
I know. You're a man.

20:49.888 --> 20:51.623
I miss Shelby.

20:51.690 --> 20:53.491
This is all about
your breakup?

20:55.027 --> 20:57.361
I know just the thing
you need.

20:57.428 --> 20:58.695
Oh, no.

20:58.763 --> 21:00.197
Just relax and breathe.

21:00.265 --> 21:01.532
I'll take your shoulders.

21:01.599 --> 21:02.666
I'll take your feet.

21:02.733 --> 21:04.301
This is really weird, man.

21:04.369 --> 21:05.502
Really weird.

21:05.570 --> 21:06.603
Cool vibe, man.

21:06.671 --> 21:09.706
What are you guys doing now?

21:09.774 --> 21:12.276
What have I gotten myself into?

21:12.343 --> 21:13.176
Hey, lady,

21:13.243 --> 21:14.410
crushing that flute, babe.

21:14.478 --> 21:15.878
And breathe.

21:15.945 --> 21:17.613
Okay, I'm trying.
I'm gonna do that.

21:17.681 --> 21:18.914
Whoa.
Just chill out.

21:18.982 --> 21:20.616
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing with my legs?

21:20.684 --> 21:22.084
No! Come on!
Come on, chill out!

21:23.220 --> 21:24.453
Nick, what are
you doing, man?!

21:24.521 --> 21:25.788
Reset. Let's reset.

21:25.855 --> 21:26.889
This is weird!

21:27.756 --> 21:29.257
No! No! No!
