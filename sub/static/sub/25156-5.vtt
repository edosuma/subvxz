00:00.600 --> 00:03.600
The category is Femme
Queen Virgin Runway.

00:03.660 --> 00:06.100
First time walking a ball!

00:06.120 --> 00:09.660
Behold the new daughters,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:09.840 --> 00:13.240
These are the
up-and-coming pretty girls,

00:13.347 --> 00:15.447
and here they come.

00:15.780 --> 00:18.140
I want you all to meet

00:18.160 --> 00:20.560
the future of our community.

00:20.700 --> 00:23.920
Giving you all-day
Spanish Harlem realness.

00:23.990 --> 00:24.990
Come through,

00:25.020 --> 00:28.940
judges score her: ten,
ten, ten, nine, nine.

00:28.980 --> 00:30.880
That did you all right,
stand to the side.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.330
And here she come, honey,
a botanical beauty.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.900
Come through, mellow yellow.

00:34.940 --> 00:36.380
Oh, mama, you look great.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.370
Big feet and all, honey.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.100
She's got the look of a model,
but the walk of a duck.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.480
All right, I see eight,
eight, eight, eight, eight.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.920
Remember, these are virgins, babies.

00:45.940 --> 00:47.420
It's not their fault, they're trying.

00:47.780 --> 00:51.500
Yes! I know that's right, darling.

00:51.560 --> 00:56.140
Mother Africa giving you
soul glow versus Soul Train.

00:56.240 --> 00:59.780
Judges score her: eight,
nine, nine, nine, eight.

00:59.840 --> 01:03.260
Are they not divine? Give
them all a round of applause.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.200
Anybody else walking?

01:05.340 --> 01:06.880
Anybody else coming through?

01:11.400 --> 01:14.500
Ooh, now who do we have over here?

01:17.340 --> 01:19.150
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is this?

01:20.340 --> 01:22.540
Wait a minute, honey,
looks like Cinderella came

01:22.550 --> 01:24.450
to the ball after midnight.

01:24.460 --> 01:25.460
Cut the music, baby.

01:25.470 --> 01:26.470
Cut the music. Cut the music.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.716
What do we got here?

01:27.740 --> 01:30.120
Blanca, my name is Blanca.
I'm from the Bronx.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.435
Miss Blanca, where is your mother?

01:31.459 --> 01:33.250
- Whose child is this?
- I don't have a mother

01:33.260 --> 01:36.120
- or a father.
- Oh, we can all see that, baby.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.720
Ain't no mother would send
her daughter out there

01:37.740 --> 01:39.680
with that cheap Shake-N-Go wig.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.659
Can somebody please adopt this child?

01:41.660 --> 01:43.300
UNICEF? Somebody help her.

01:43.370 --> 01:46.305
The category is Virgin
Runway, sweetheart,

01:46.407 --> 01:49.208
not a little drag-in-a-box left
at the fire station, honey.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.270
Somebody help her.

01:52.660 --> 01:55.420
Please help this girl.
Look at her shoes!

01:56.260 --> 01:57.680
That dress.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.659
I can't with the wig, honey.

01:59.660 --> 02:00.980
Help this... oh, she coming.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.380
Can I have my scores, please?

02:04.420 --> 02:06.600
All right, judges. You
heard Little Orphan Annie.

02:06.620 --> 02:07.799
Can we get these scores?

02:07.800 --> 02:10.800
Seven, seven, six, six, six.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.250
Bye-bye, Blanca! Maybe
next time, sweetheart.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.779
Like my girlfriend says,

02:15.780 --> 02:17.459
it takes nerve to walk a ball,

02:17.460 --> 02:20.260
but Blanca, bitch, you had nerve.

02:20.307 --> 02:24.209
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
our grand prize winner, Leesa!

02:33.640 --> 02:36.450
Congratulations, girl, like...

02:36.550 --> 02:38.040
Oh, my God, oh, my God,

02:38.080 --> 02:40.300
did you guys catch that
stubble under those lights?

02:40.320 --> 02:41.320
Ooh.

02:41.330 --> 02:43.180
Catch it? She basically cut my cheek

02:43.200 --> 02:44.660
when she went in for a kiss.

02:44.680 --> 02:48.220
- I feel attacked.
- Girl, what was she thinking?

02:48.230 --> 02:50.140
- I don't know.
- I think she came at the wrong category.

02:50.150 --> 02:54.139
This was not Butch Queen
Up in Drags, right? Uh...

02:54.240 --> 02:55.579
Butch queen, huh?

02:55.580 --> 02:57.377
So is this what sisterhood looks like?

02:57.378 --> 02:59.289
A bunch of birds clipping
each other's wings?

02:59.313 --> 03:04.183
Well, first off, you have to be
a girl to be a sister, mister.

03:06.253 --> 03:08.053
And who are you to talk?

03:08.155 --> 03:10.020
You are so ghastly,

03:10.040 --> 03:11.466
you could walk into the haunted house

03:11.490 --> 03:13.140
and leave with a job application.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.430
Those reads are so tired,

03:18.460 --> 03:21.579
like that sad rag on
top of your head. Ah!

03:21.580 --> 03:22.719
You know what? Those are fighting words.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.156
- You want to brawl?
- Boy, bring it.

03:24.180 --> 03:25.540
Now, Kisha.

03:25.620 --> 03:26.980
Who are you calling a boy?

03:27.040 --> 03:29.520
Your real hair's so short,
you could roll it with rice.

03:29.540 --> 03:32.270
And what is that on your lips, Leesa?

03:32.340 --> 03:34.880
Oh, it's just your favorite lip gloss.

03:35.160 --> 03:36.460
Sperm.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.680
Why don't you low-rent,
bad-handjob-giving hookers

03:39.700 --> 03:41.360
run back to the pier where you belong

03:41.380 --> 03:43.480
with the rest of the city vermin.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.740
Um... thank you, Miss Elektra.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.920
I'm sorry a legend like you had to be

03:54.940 --> 03:56.440
in the presence of such pettiness.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.337
I'm surprised you know who I am.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.350
Clearly, this was your first ball.

04:00.374 --> 04:02.185
I'm grateful you came to my rescue,

04:02.209 --> 04:04.176
considering how poorly I scored.

04:04.460 --> 04:06.860
Anyways, I'll get out of your
hair and I'll be on my way.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.330
I cannot hear a thing you're saying

04:09.350 --> 04:11.261
over the protests of your stomach.

04:11.280 --> 04:12.740
When did you last eat?

04:12.760 --> 04:14.410
Mmm.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.480
There really is no rush.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.440
Indigestion isn't flattering.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.920
I'm sorry.

04:23.590 --> 04:25.620
I haven't had something
warm in a minute.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.880
So what's your story?

04:28.980 --> 04:30.660
Let me guess.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.270
Mommy kicked you out after
catching you in a dress.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.880
Where are you staying?

04:37.240 --> 04:39.520
Usually at Washington Square.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.900
Some nights I get a bed
at the youth shelter.

04:42.780 --> 04:44.900
What possessed you tonight?

04:46.340 --> 04:49.760
I wanted to be pretty, to be seen.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.800
To belong, I guess.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.680
I thought this community
would see me and want me.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.230
I know I wasn't great,

05:00.334 --> 05:02.770
and I know I don't have my
look all the way put together,

05:02.780 --> 05:06.200
but it felt warm under those lights.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.660
You do have potential.

05:08.740 --> 05:10.680
We just have to work
on your look before you

05:10.720 --> 05:13.340
ever step foot in front
of those shady bitches.

05:18.220 --> 05:19.600
Can I be honest with you?

05:21.400 --> 05:23.900
I don't think I'll ever
be as real as you.

05:24.420 --> 05:27.080
No one questions you or looks
at you like they do me.

05:27.140 --> 05:29.460
It's not that I give a fuck
about what people think,

05:29.620 --> 05:32.780
but I do want to be seen
and respected as a woman.

05:32.980 --> 05:35.040
That's who I see myself to be.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.419
You think I just woke
up one day and poof,

05:37.420 --> 05:39.860
I look like this? No.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.079
It takes work, drive,

05:42.080 --> 05:44.240
sacrifice to be a woman.

05:46.060 --> 05:48.460
You have something rarer
than beauty, though.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.080
You have heart

05:50.160 --> 05:52.080
and you're not afraid to lead with it.

05:52.180 --> 05:55.220
That quality will get you everything.

05:55.420 --> 05:58.900
Now, what is it you want, my child?

06:00.920 --> 06:02.600
I don't want to be cold again.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.760
And I don't want to be laughed at again.

06:06.840 --> 06:09.000
I want to be real.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.220
You're coming home with mother.

06:11.270 --> 06:13.900
- Check, please.
- Wait, you want to be my mother?

06:14.500 --> 06:15.780
No.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.660
I am your mother.

06:28.322 --> 06:30.422
The category is...

06:30.524 --> 06:34.159
Live...

06:34.261 --> 06:36.294
Work...

06:36.390 --> 06:40.420
Pose!

06:41.600 --> 06:45.170

07:09.990 --> 07:11.180
Papi.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.840
- Papi.
- Hmm?

07:18.920 --> 07:20.750
I told you to dust out the living area.

07:20.760 --> 07:22.580
- I did.
- So how come those shelves

07:22.620 --> 07:24.200
still got an inch of filth on them?

07:24.320 --> 07:26.320
You wanted me to do the shelves, too?

07:26.420 --> 07:28.540
I'm your mother, not your maid.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.590
Spring cleaning is gonna
be a tradition around here

07:30.600 --> 07:31.960
just like any other holiday.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.440
I like Christmas better.

07:44.180 --> 07:46.180
How'd you clean this room so fast?

07:47.320 --> 07:48.760
I'm efficient.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.450
Oh, get your ass up

07:57.460 --> 07:59.200
and clean this room right.

07:59.220 --> 08:00.600
And why are you back?

08:00.680 --> 08:02.926
I thought your yuppie white boy
got you a fancy apartment.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.780
She mad at him 'cause he lame.

08:05.200 --> 08:07.410
This is a A-B conversation,

08:07.420 --> 08:09.040
so "C" your way out.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.400
No, don't tell me.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.500
You asked him to leave
his wife and he said no.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.020
Not exactly.

08:14.790 --> 08:17.220
He's committed to her.
And that's the problem.

08:17.340 --> 08:19.240
He needs to know I ain't no side chick.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.480
And if he wants Angel, he
needs to commit, full time.

08:22.540 --> 08:23.940
So let me get this straight.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.830
To prove how mad you are,

08:25.840 --> 08:27.780
you moved out of your luxury co-op

08:27.800 --> 08:30.040
to come back here in this
creaky-ass apartment?

08:30.070 --> 08:32.200
Yup. I'm playing hard to get.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.559
And how does that affect him?

08:33.580 --> 08:34.990
He's gonna miss me so bad,

08:35.010 --> 08:36.960
he is going to beg me to come back.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.419
We're not done here.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.620
Hello?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.040
Are you okay? What-what is it?

09:00.800 --> 09:02.750
That was a ca...

09:02.760 --> 09:05.740
a call from my friend
from-from my old hood.

09:07.910 --> 09:09.460
My mother died.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.940
My mother died.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.860
Is Carmen home?

09:55.940 --> 09:57.240
Ma!

09:57.300 --> 09:59.260
Some lady's at the door for you.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.760
Who is it?

10:08.440 --> 10:09.700
Not sure I'd recognize you

10:09.710 --> 10:11.460
if we walked past each
other in Key Food.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.960
- Who's at the door?
- It's my brother!

10:16.120 --> 10:18.300
Why didn't you call to
tell me that Mami died?

10:18.760 --> 10:21.360
I sent you a Christmas card
with my number and everything.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.280
Must've got lost in the mail.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.120
I'll be there at the
funeral home on Thursday.

10:25.140 --> 10:26.480
I was one of her kids, too.

10:28.920 --> 10:30.890
You made your choice, Mateo.

10:30.990 --> 10:33.640
- That's not my name, Carmen.
- Whatever you're calling yourself,

10:33.720 --> 10:35.320
this ain't the time for your confusion.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.800
Mami suffered enough.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.620
You're still blaming me for her pain.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.680
Where were you when Mami
had all her appointments?

10:41.740 --> 10:43.900
- Or when she was up all night in pain?
- You're right!

10:43.940 --> 10:46.180
I wasn't around, and I'm sorry.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.800
But how am I supposed to show up?

10:48.810 --> 10:50.310
You won't even invite me in.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.340
I don't know what you are.

10:53.540 --> 10:56.120
Tell me how to explain

10:56.160 --> 10:58.960
to a ten-year-old that her uncle is gay,

10:59.020 --> 11:00.750
and runs around in women's clothes.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.480
You tell her the truth.

11:03.790 --> 11:06.580
You tell her that I am a woman.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.200
And how am I supposed to
explain to the family

11:11.260 --> 11:12.630
that you're not dead?

11:15.920 --> 11:17.600
You told them I died?

11:17.710 --> 11:20.360
No. Mami did.

11:21.640 --> 11:22.810
Right.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.710
I pray for you, Mateo.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.370
You save your prayers

11:27.380 --> 11:29.580
for someone who actually needs them.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.030
Ooh, ooh!

11:34.040 --> 11:36.760
My cooking is as good as the
Puerto Rican restaurant.

11:36.860 --> 11:39.620
Yeah. It's just missing
a little something.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.040
This is the recipe you gave me.

11:41.060 --> 11:43.080
It takes a couple of times to perfect.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.900
My mother made the best pasteles.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.380
I loved our kitchen time.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.550
When you're competing with two
older siblings for attention,

11:54.580 --> 11:56.490
you don't get a lot of alone moments.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.900
But cooking?

12:01.820 --> 12:03.540
That was our special time.

12:16.660 --> 12:18.420
Girl, it can't taste that bad.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.720
I miss her.

12:30.240 --> 12:31.950
You'll always have the memories.

12:32.050 --> 12:34.840
Yeah. The good and the bad.

12:35.940 --> 12:37.320
Yes, ma'am.

12:38.690 --> 12:41.060
You know, that's the
burden of having a parent.

12:41.140 --> 12:42.970
They haven't a clue what they're doing.

12:42.990 --> 12:46.660
And every mistake they
make chips away at us.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.960
As we get older, we got to
glue the pieces back together.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.440
And we can blame them.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.560
But here's the thing.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.320
They're human.

12:58.980 --> 13:00.940
They make mistakes.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.830
When my daddy died, I...

13:03.840 --> 13:05.440
I went through it.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.300
I blamed myself for all the...

13:10.000 --> 13:12.160
black eyes

13:12.460 --> 13:14.180
and lost time.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.480
Have you found forgiveness?

13:17.560 --> 13:19.760
Oh, it depends on the day.

13:19.840 --> 13:20.930
I feel you.

13:23.020 --> 13:24.870
I don't know, Pray, it just...

13:24.970 --> 13:27.690
it don't feel right,
attending the funeral

13:27.700 --> 13:29.180
of a woman who rejected me.

13:29.220 --> 13:31.560
You're a mother now. You
have to be an example.

13:31.580 --> 13:33.390
You got to teach these
kids how to handle death.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.810
Pray Tell, all my
relatives will be there.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.600
I don't need the drama.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.900
You have us now.

13:42.850 --> 13:44.650
Your real family.

13:44.750 --> 13:47.360
And we will be standing
there right beside you.

13:48.220 --> 13:49.920
Girl...

13:50.030 --> 13:52.670
Oh, God, I wish that I would've gone

13:52.680 --> 13:54.340
to my father's funeral.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.600
Maybe the wounds
would've healed quicker.

14:08.420 --> 14:09.620
They started a while ago.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.790
No such thing as late
when you close like I do.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.780
Mr. Trump decided to join the meeting.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.480
Shit.

14:16.650 --> 14:18.940
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

14:20.380 --> 14:21.920
Hey. Boss still in there?

14:21.940 --> 14:23.520
No. He asked about you, though.

14:23.560 --> 14:26.190
- Nice work, Stan. Congrats.
- Thanks.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.976
Let's get a bite at the
Oak Room later this week.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.180
Congrats for what?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.960
The boy wonder got a promotion.

14:31.020 --> 14:33.420
We get to see how big his
dick is in the VP bathroom.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.420
See you.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.800
How long has this been in the works?

14:41.860 --> 14:44.040
Not long. Like, a few weeks, maybe.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.720
I'm your mentor.

14:49.820 --> 14:52.090
I hired you, New Jersey.

14:55.140 --> 14:57.440
Are you in on the Plaza Hotel deal now?

14:58.220 --> 14:59.320
Yeah.

14:59.920 --> 15:01.370
I thought you would be happy about it.

15:01.380 --> 15:02.900
It's good when a bet you make pays off.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.490
Why the fuck would I be happy about it?

15:04.500 --> 15:06.120
Do you fucking know me at all?

15:11.380 --> 15:13.900
There are only so many points
in a deal like the Plaza.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.260
You coming on that deal

15:16.280 --> 15:18.580
is you literally stealing
money from my pocket.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.610
This is a zero-sum game to me.

15:21.740 --> 15:22.920
Matt.

15:24.300 --> 15:25.990
I'm grateful to you.

15:26.090 --> 15:28.550
I learn a lot from you,

15:28.560 --> 15:30.520
and the last thing I wanted to do here

15:30.540 --> 15:32.660
was show you any disrespect.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.580
No, what you showed me
is exactly who you are.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.700
And now I'll show you exactly who I am.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.680
The category is...

15:52.700 --> 15:54.460
Perfect Tens.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.920
You must have face,

15:56.960 --> 15:59.380
body and realness.

15:59.460 --> 16:00.900
You got something to tuck?

16:00.920 --> 16:05.080
That shit better be streamlined
into invisibility.

16:07.930 --> 16:10.580
You have to pass in every way, bitches.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.610
Your hair has to pass.

16:12.620 --> 16:14.940
Your clothes have to pass.

16:15.020 --> 16:17.700
Your makeup has to pass.

16:18.080 --> 16:21.520
Your face has to pass.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.980
Passing is your gateway
into the mainstream.

16:25.020 --> 16:27.260
You want an invitation
into that magical world?

16:27.300 --> 16:30.840
You had best come immaculate.

16:30.960 --> 16:34.200
This is a category for real women only.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.420
If you ain't Diana fucking Ross

16:37.440 --> 16:40.440
ready to sing the "Theme to Mahogany,"

16:40.540 --> 16:44.800
don't you step foot on that floor.

16:45.720 --> 16:49.260
God hath bestowed upon
you a great many gifts.

16:49.440 --> 16:53.900
Charm, beauty, sensuality.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.430
But the thing that you can thank Him for

16:56.460 --> 16:58.660
is that He made you a woman.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.280
Perfection.

17:01.290 --> 17:02.620
Shine, woman.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.099
Glow, woman.

17:05.140 --> 17:08.160
Give us permission to celebrate you

17:08.280 --> 17:11.420
in all your feminine glory.

17:14.099 --> 17:16.069
I take no pleasure in telling you this.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.260
Don't think I didn't struggle
before deciding to do it.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.980
I'm sure you struggled plenty.

17:25.819 --> 17:28.099
I'm here because I need your help.

17:28.220 --> 17:31.320
This woman, whoever she is,
he's obsessed with her.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.770
It's getting in the way of his work.

17:33.870 --> 17:35.850
He's coming in late, he's leaving early.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.380
Sloppiness.

17:37.780 --> 17:39.840
Don't act like this is
coming out of the blue.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.080
When I was here at Christmas,
you were suspecting something.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.850
When you were here on
Christmas, you kissed me.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.240
I believe you, I just don't trust you.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.760
That's where she lives.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.700
I followed him after work.

18:07.540 --> 18:09.840
My number's on the other
side of that card.

18:09.940 --> 18:11.940
Call me if you need to talk.

18:12.460 --> 18:15.420
Or if you just want to come
into the city and grab a drink.

18:18.480 --> 18:20.860
Even if I wasn't with Stan,

18:21.300 --> 18:23.400
I would never be with you.

18:23.480 --> 18:25.920
I want you to know that.

18:26.200 --> 18:29.200
I'm not just some dopey
Jersey housewife.

18:29.260 --> 18:32.000
I am not trapped in
this life. I choose it.

18:33.660 --> 18:35.080
Okay.

18:35.680 --> 18:38.030
Then, if, when you decide

18:38.040 --> 18:40.190
that I'm telling the truth about
what your husband is up to,

18:40.200 --> 18:44.360
and you decide to
choose a different life,

18:44.680 --> 18:47.040
one where you need to make
your own money, call me.

18:47.060 --> 18:49.250
I'm always looking to hire new talent.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.210
The woman that lives in that place,

19:27.220 --> 19:28.480
she moved out a couple of weeks ago.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.620
I mean, the rent's paid
up for three months, so,

19:30.640 --> 19:32.550
you know, I haven't taken
her name off the list yet.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.300
Now, you friends with her, uh... ?

19:34.360 --> 19:36.860
Um, whose name is on the lease?

19:36.960 --> 19:39.000
- Sorry?
- Is Angel's name on the lease,

19:39.030 --> 19:42.070
or-or did-did someone cosign with her?

19:42.080 --> 19:44.160
Well, yeah, it's
confidential information.

19:44.220 --> 19:46.040
Mm.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.020
Could-could you just check for me?

19:49.260 --> 19:53.040
I... I want to know if my
husband's name is on the lease.

19:53.150 --> 19:56.010
Stan Bowes. I'm Patty Bowes.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.560
Here's my driver's license.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.440
Come into my office.

20:07.580 --> 20:09.280
You sure you want to know this?

20:10.160 --> 20:11.740
I think so.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.680
Why? You think I'm
doing the wrong thing?

20:14.700 --> 20:16.180
Look, I got four daughters. Right?

20:16.200 --> 20:18.250
If you were one of them,
yeah, I'd tell you to know.

20:18.480 --> 20:22.140
It's, uh, yeah.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.220
Did Angel leave a forwarding address?

20:43.360 --> 20:45.770
Yes, yes, yes, give it to her!

20:45.780 --> 20:47.180
Give it to her!

20:47.200 --> 20:50.600
Show some love, bitches! Show some love!

20:50.700 --> 20:54.480
I can't hear you!

21:00.800 --> 21:02.020
You ready, girl?

21:02.080 --> 21:03.340
Always.

21:11.500 --> 21:12.580
Yes, baby?

21:14.380 --> 21:16.180
- Without Elektra?
- Mm-hmm.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.180
Silence!

21:20.220 --> 21:23.720
Clear the floor, children.
Clear the floor.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.880
We've got ourselves a
challenge on this evening.

21:26.980 --> 21:30.910
For the House of Mugler!

21:32.910 --> 21:36.150
From Elektra's legendary children.

21:36.250 --> 21:39.140
We are more than Elektra's
goddamn children, Pray Tell.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.810
Say our names.

21:40.820 --> 21:42.030
Oh.

21:42.060 --> 21:44.820
I stand corrected.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.890
Miss Candy.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.150
House of Mugler, do you
accept this challenge

21:50.160 --> 21:51.720
from the House of Abundance?

21:54.030 --> 21:57.300
Honey, we never back
down from a challenge.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.900
Ever!

21:58.940 --> 22:00.500
And you.

22:00.540 --> 22:03.140
Them is fighting words, bitches!

22:04.140 --> 22:06.350
The category is...

22:06.360 --> 22:08.600
Modèle Effet.

22:09.020 --> 22:12.730
As a house, I need to see the pages

22:12.740 --> 22:17.460
of Anna Wintour's new
Vogue coming to life.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.820
Come on, look at Miss Candy.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.600
Serving us 1988

22:21.640 --> 22:24.440
working girl on a mission.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.170
And Mother Mugler in her best

22:26.180 --> 22:29.080
Love Boat inspired couture.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.400
And where are the children?

22:30.420 --> 22:32.050
Do I see any children in the house?

22:32.070 --> 22:35.910
Oh, oh, and they have arrived.

22:35.940 --> 22:39.390
Yes, yes, yes, I know that
we have good weather,

22:39.400 --> 22:42.180
but why are you wearing that pleather?

22:45.640 --> 22:49.020
Looking like a baby dyke Don Corleone.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.060
Oh, what?

23:00.100 --> 23:02.840
With skin like that, honey, why
are you wearing that color?

23:02.860 --> 23:04.940
You should stick to jewel tones, baby.

23:10.720 --> 23:11.790
What do we got?

23:11.800 --> 23:15.380
Uh, oh, oh, oh!

23:15.720 --> 23:18.000
No weave, bitches.

23:18.040 --> 23:20.080
No extensions!

23:20.120 --> 23:24.920
Just pure, unadulterated Modèle Effet.

23:25.020 --> 23:27.420
Ooh, it's so hot in here,
y'all ready for some scores?

23:27.500 --> 23:29.700
I can't hear you. Y'all
ready for some scores?

23:29.760 --> 23:30.860
Yes!

23:30.960 --> 23:33.000
Come on, line it up. Line it up.

23:33.040 --> 23:35.520
All right, so, for the House of
Mugler, what are your scores?

23:35.580 --> 23:38.030
Ten, ten, ten, ten,

23:38.040 --> 23:42.300
nine!

23:42.440 --> 23:46.930
There's a small margin of error.

23:46.940 --> 23:48.290
All right, House of Abundance.

23:48.350 --> 23:49.920
Judges, your scores.

23:50.020 --> 23:54.050
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

23:54.150 --> 23:56.700
Oh, work it out.

23:57.500 --> 24:00.420
First runner up, House of Mugler.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.020
Grand prize, House of Abundance.

24:03.060 --> 24:06.160
Yes, motherfuckers!

24:06.520 --> 24:07.570
We did it.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.740
The cards never lie, my darling.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.440
The cards never lie.

24:11.500 --> 24:15.170
Behold, Miss Lulu and Miss Candy,

24:15.200 --> 24:18.860
two up-and-coming mothers in the making.

24:22.020 --> 24:26.920
Miss Elektra, you better get
on up out of that hospital bed

24:27.020 --> 24:30.160
and come on and reclaim your house.

24:32.780 --> 24:35.320
Miss Elektra, you have a visitor.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.480
Is now a good time?

24:36.520 --> 24:39.500
"Good time"? More like it's about time.

24:45.910 --> 24:48.300
What the fuck are you doing here?

24:48.360 --> 24:49.720
Is there a problem?

24:49.800 --> 24:51.030
No problem.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.280
That's just the way she
speaks when she's happy.

24:53.320 --> 24:56.200
She can stay. As the World Turns is over

24:56.220 --> 24:59.620
and television is a wasteland
until the evening news.

24:59.850 --> 25:01.360
Who sent you these?

25:01.420 --> 25:04.140
- My gentleman friend.
- Nah, if they were from him,

25:04.160 --> 25:05.736
this whole room would
be filled with them.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.780
I'm guessing you bought
those for yourself.

25:11.460 --> 25:14.580
You're the last person I
expected to see here.

25:14.700 --> 25:16.880
Isn't there a sale going
on down at the Payless

25:16.900 --> 25:18.010
you should be attending?

25:18.040 --> 25:20.300
Oh, look at you. Still talking big game

25:20.320 --> 25:21.956
even though you just
went through the most

25:21.980 --> 25:23.520
meaningful experience in your life

25:23.560 --> 25:25.860
and not one person has
come to celebrate with you

25:25.900 --> 25:27.500
or look after you while you're in pain.

25:27.680 --> 25:30.370
Don't think they won't pay
for their mistreatment.

25:30.380 --> 25:32.440
See, that's your problem.

25:32.540 --> 25:35.180
This whole room should be
filled with laughing girls

25:35.190 --> 25:39.020
and balloons and children
doing their mother's hair.

25:39.030 --> 25:41.890
But all anyone wants to
give you is payback.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.160
You're a terrible mother.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.200
And that's exactly what you get.

25:46.220 --> 25:48.130
My legendary house and its children

25:48.200 --> 25:50.820
have snagged more trophies than anyone.

25:50.860 --> 25:52.680
But you're not kind.

25:52.780 --> 25:54.910
You don't care for them, Elektra.

25:55.010 --> 25:57.090
You're not walking the
walk in our community.

25:57.110 --> 25:58.920
You're rich. You're beautiful.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.520
You pass.

26:00.740 --> 26:02.840
You think that makes you better than us.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.560
Because I am.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.890
I have always been a survivor.

26:09.990 --> 26:13.120
- I wouldn't bet against me.
- I pity you.

26:13.420 --> 26:15.580
Life comes for all of us, Elektra.

26:15.640 --> 26:16.820
And it comes hardest for the ones

26:16.840 --> 26:18.180
who think they're above it all.

26:18.820 --> 26:20.290
Is this why you're here?

26:20.300 --> 26:21.850
To be the little devil on my shoulder

26:21.860 --> 26:23.700
whispering warnings in my ear?

26:23.720 --> 26:24.820
No.

26:33.950 --> 26:37.050
I'm here because in my
life I've had two mothers.

26:37.150 --> 26:41.020
The one that brought me
into this world and you.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.480
The first one...

26:51.360 --> 26:54.330
the first one died just this week...

26:58.160 --> 27:01.440
... before she could forgive
me, before I could forgive her.

27:03.140 --> 27:05.910
And you and I, we got our problems.

27:06.010 --> 27:09.200
Enough water under the bridge
to drown this whole city.

27:11.260 --> 27:13.490
And the world may have
destroyed the version of you

27:13.500 --> 27:15.500
who saved me that night outside the ball

27:15.560 --> 27:17.440
and took me under your wing,

27:18.220 --> 27:20.600
but you're the only mother I have left.

27:28.540 --> 27:30.490
You may be a terrible
mother, but that don't mean

27:30.500 --> 27:33.560
I can't be the loving
daughter I want to be.

27:44.320 --> 27:47.560
I'll call a nurse to get a
vase for those flowers,

27:47.940 --> 27:50.440
even though they're from a deli.

27:59.170 --> 28:00.680
So how does it feel?

28:03.620 --> 28:06.220
It hurts worse than I ever imagined.

28:07.620 --> 28:13.000
But it also feels better
than I've ever dreamed.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.100
We made a mistake coming.

28:55.160 --> 28:56.880
This is not about them.

28:58.060 --> 29:00.490
You came to make peace with your mama.

29:00.590 --> 29:02.140
Come on.

29:06.540 --> 29:07.900
Come on, come on, come on.

29:31.690 --> 29:33.160
What are you doing here?

29:33.220 --> 29:35.540
I have a right to be
here to say good-bye.

29:37.430 --> 29:40.460
Oh, my God, is that Mateo?

29:45.860 --> 29:47.060
You need to go.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.320
- Now.
- Manuel, get off.

29:53.080 --> 29:55.550
Manny, por favor, not today.

29:55.650 --> 29:58.320
Let him say good-bye and then he'll go.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.600
Kindness doesn't cost you anything.

30:03.260 --> 30:06.220
Let her say good-bye.

30:17.440 --> 30:19.120
Take your time, baby.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.440
Hi, Mami.

30:32.750 --> 30:34.880
It's been a while.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.960
I'm... I'm a mother now.

30:39.560 --> 30:41.420
I got a house of kids.

30:41.730 --> 30:43.920
Pains in my ass, too.

30:49.670 --> 30:52.740
So I hope, finally, you're
proud of me, wherever you are.

30:53.920 --> 30:57.480
I said some messed up things
the last time we spoke.

30:58.540 --> 31:01.280
And I hope you know that
I'll always love you.

31:03.450 --> 31:06.200
I know you didn't know how
to raise a child like me.

31:07.940 --> 31:09.780
You tried your best,

31:10.440 --> 31:13.200
and I want you to know
that I forgive you

31:14.420 --> 31:18.380
and... I love you.

31:28.580 --> 31:30.720
Let's go.

31:35.140 --> 31:38.380
I can't believe Mateo grew
up to be a transvestite.

31:38.480 --> 31:40.660
Pobrecito needs a better wig.

31:40.780 --> 31:42.820
A child lost her mother today

31:42.900 --> 31:44.720
and I would expect someone who espouses

31:44.740 --> 31:45.790
the word of the Lord to have a

31:45.800 --> 31:47.200
little bit more compassion.

31:47.220 --> 31:49.140
She's not defined by
that wig on her head

31:49.160 --> 31:51.380
any more than you are
by that frizzy perm.

32:00.670 --> 32:02.200
You're so strong.

32:06.240 --> 32:07.740
Well, I couldn't have done it.

32:07.820 --> 32:09.980
I would've been too scared.

32:10.100 --> 32:12.600
You maintained your dignity
and I'm proud of you.

32:12.620 --> 32:15.490
It's okay. It's okay.

32:15.590 --> 32:17.180
That's all right. Let it out.

32:17.390 --> 32:18.800
Let it out.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.990
Yo, I can call my homeboy

32:21.000 --> 32:22.836
to jump whoever you want
for, like, a Benjamin.

32:22.860 --> 32:24.560
- Boy.
- I'm for reals.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.900
Nah, we good. We all good.

32:27.060 --> 32:28.380
Mateo.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.120
My name is Blanca now.

32:32.370 --> 32:33.600
Blanca.

32:34.610 --> 32:37.640
There's a gathering at your
mother's after the wake.

32:38.220 --> 32:39.480
You should come.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.220
Have some food.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.450
So when was the last time you were here?

32:50.760 --> 32:52.700
Um...

32:52.940 --> 32:54.950
October 30, 1982.

32:54.980 --> 32:56.080
Oh.

32:59.570 --> 33:02.100
Did she ever talk about what happened?

33:02.340 --> 33:04.540
No. Not to me.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.180
My sister was always very
private with her emotions.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.490
Except for when she was cooking.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.710
That's how she expressed love.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.410
Don't I know it. Have
you seen these nalgas?

33:17.260 --> 33:19.600
But you, you're so skinny, are
you getting enough to eat?

33:19.620 --> 33:21.660
- I think I...
- I mean, come on, look at this.

33:21.690 --> 33:24.690
There's no nalgas there.
What's going on?

33:24.720 --> 33:26.490
Come, make yourself a nice, big plate.

33:26.500 --> 33:27.920
There's plenty of food.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.020
Are you leaving?

34:07.280 --> 34:08.980
I'm making a plate to go.

34:09.100 --> 34:10.780
What's that?

34:11.199 --> 34:12.880
Mami's recipes.

34:13.320 --> 34:14.639
I'm gonna take it.

34:14.699 --> 34:16.370
Nah, put it back.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.770
Carmen and I haven't
decided what we're selling

34:18.780 --> 34:19.960
and what we're giving away.

34:20.040 --> 34:22.449
You can do whatever you want
with the rest of her stuff.

34:22.550 --> 34:24.199
I just want the notebook.

34:24.260 --> 34:26.449
Just put the notebook back.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.080
I can't have her recipes,

34:34.120 --> 34:36.600
but you're already sporting her jewelry?

34:36.659 --> 34:39.590
Mami gave her that before she died.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.100
If you'd have been a better son,
she would've left you something.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.560
Aren't you the one that they
had to take to rehab twice?

34:50.639 --> 34:53.000
Nobody wants you here, child molester.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.350
I know all about how you fags

34:55.360 --> 34:57.139
corrupt kids.

34:58.060 --> 34:59.630
Mami, what's happening?

34:59.650 --> 35:01.500
Xiomara, vete. Go to your room.

35:01.750 --> 35:03.180
You see what you're doing?

35:03.200 --> 35:04.380
Upsetting everybody?

35:04.400 --> 35:07.220
Manny, that's enough. You should go.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.890
We should have gone to the hospital.

35:14.900 --> 35:17.400
Boy, shut up.

35:21.040 --> 35:23.120
What the hell?

35:23.180 --> 35:24.950
Look who we have here,

35:24.960 --> 35:27.260
my victorious children.

35:27.410 --> 35:29.140
What's all this?

35:29.380 --> 35:32.280
Just a little welcome home
feast for my children

35:32.320 --> 35:34.460
who think so well of me
that they abandoned me

35:34.490 --> 35:37.750
after I've undergone one of the
most monumental operations

35:37.760 --> 35:39.820
a woman could ever have.

35:39.860 --> 35:41.920
I wanted to be there,
Mother, I-I promise.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.420
My sweet child, I know.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.740
Now what say you, Lulu? Candy?

35:48.780 --> 35:52.440
I ain't got shit to say
or to apologize for.

35:54.900 --> 35:56.410
I agree, daughter.

35:56.510 --> 35:59.610
At first, I must admit,
I was fuming so much

35:59.620 --> 36:02.220
in my recovery suite that I ran a fever.

36:03.260 --> 36:04.570
But then I realized,

36:04.580 --> 36:06.600
thanks to some guidance
from an old friend,

36:06.620 --> 36:09.650
that I was getting all of the
love and attention I deserved.

36:10.660 --> 36:11.960
None.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.800
I gave you children nothing

36:14.920 --> 36:17.920
and expected everything in return.

36:23.340 --> 36:25.100
I'm a hard bitch.

36:25.180 --> 36:28.370
But mothers aren't supposed
to be hard all the time.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.690
They need to spread the
sugar around sometimes.

36:34.020 --> 36:35.610
That don't look like sugar.

36:35.620 --> 36:37.450
Sloppy joe.

36:37.550 --> 36:39.420
- Really, again?
- What?

36:39.520 --> 36:41.800
Is ground beef the only
thing you know how to cook?

36:42.520 --> 36:44.296
I feel like I'm starting
to smell like a hamburger.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.320
And that ain't cute.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.020
It sure ain't. But guess what?

36:47.040 --> 36:49.460
It's better than what you was
eating on that park bench.

36:49.560 --> 36:50.590
I like ground beef.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.610
You could do meatloaf,
tacos, Hamburger Helper.

36:53.630 --> 36:55.210
Enough about the beef.

36:55.220 --> 36:57.000
It's time to get serious.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.010
This Mother's Day has reminded me

36:59.020 --> 37:01.340
of how I've fallen short
with you children.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.730
I know I've lost your trust.

37:03.740 --> 37:06.540
I'm going to earn it
back the best way we,

37:06.600 --> 37:08.740
the House of Abundance, knows how.

37:09.450 --> 37:12.800
We will be triumphant at
the Mother's Day ball.

37:12.960 --> 37:15.200
Lemar, rack please.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.140
Bitch, what got into you?

37:23.630 --> 37:27.940
Each of my children will be
draped in luxurious fineries.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.260
Ooh, this is me. Bitch,
this is from Saks.

37:34.300 --> 37:35.590
And Bergdorf's.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.160
These feathers is mad dingy.

37:37.200 --> 37:38.200
It's fuchsia.

37:38.210 --> 37:40.876
- Where did Pray pluck them from?
- It looks like one of the dead pigeons

37:40.900 --> 37:42.150
floating in the East River.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.740
Oh, y'all are really trying me.

37:43.860 --> 37:47.510
I cannot wait for our
triumphant return to the stage.

37:47.520 --> 37:51.360
We are well on our way to being
the greatest of all time.

37:51.400 --> 37:54.620
And the way to do that
is to crush our enemies

37:54.630 --> 37:56.590
until their bones are dust

37:56.600 --> 37:58.600
and their names are forgotten.

38:01.240 --> 38:04.020
Starting with those
upstarts, Evangelista.

38:08.470 --> 38:09.890
We got to do better than this

38:09.900 --> 38:11.450
if we're gonna beat post-op Elektra.

38:12.140 --> 38:14.780
You know she's gonna be
flaunting her new puss smell

38:14.860 --> 38:16.160
all up in them judges' noses.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.320
Nobody in ballroom wants to smell that.

38:18.380 --> 38:22.280
Plus, we'll have heart, a
real purpose as a house.

38:25.460 --> 38:29.430
We gonna walk the Mother's Day
ball in honor of my mother.

38:36.720 --> 38:38.700
I know she wasn't perfect, but...

38:39.080 --> 38:41.510
she's deserving of remembrance.

38:41.610 --> 38:43.280
And I loved her.

38:45.320 --> 38:49.080
And I know my children are
gonna show out for me for her.

38:55.180 --> 38:56.560
I'm all right.

38:58.180 --> 38:59.620
We got you.

39:05.360 --> 39:08.150
I'm sure a little soak in some Dawn

39:08.160 --> 39:10.090
will get the stains right out.

39:10.100 --> 39:11.100
Right?

39:12.140 --> 39:13.540
Blanca.

39:20.170 --> 39:23.290
We are going to have a feast
before the ball tonight.

39:23.310 --> 39:24.840
I need y'all to have y'all energy to

39:24.850 --> 39:26.850
slay the competition.

39:28.390 --> 39:30.450
I don't think this recipe is right.

39:31.590 --> 39:33.370
It is definitely missing something.

39:33.410 --> 39:34.686
You added the eggs and the butter?

39:34.710 --> 39:36.010
Yes.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.690
We should've just got Aunt Jemima.

39:38.710 --> 39:39.910
It's two ingredients.

39:40.010 --> 39:42.110
It's too nasty is what it is.

39:45.570 --> 39:46.920
Mm.

39:47.070 --> 39:49.270
Listen, boy, keep stirring.
It should thin out.

39:49.290 --> 39:50.650
I'll be right back.

39:57.010 --> 39:58.700
What you doing here?

39:59.790 --> 40:01.800
I wanted to bring this to you.

40:07.010 --> 40:10.690
I'm never gonna use it
and Manny don't cook.

40:10.810 --> 40:12.920
Well, don't you want to use
this to teach Xiomara?

40:12.940 --> 40:15.010
We're making our own
mother-daughter memories.

40:15.350 --> 40:18.170
You and Mami were the ones who
loved to be in the kitchen.

40:18.250 --> 40:19.820
You should have it.

40:22.490 --> 40:23.490
I lied.

40:24.860 --> 40:26.660
Mami talked about you.

40:26.760 --> 40:28.450
Right up till the end.

40:31.310 --> 40:32.730
Well, what did she say?

40:33.530 --> 40:35.610
She had a lot of regret that
she didn't get it right.

40:35.770 --> 40:37.340
She didn't believe in your choice

40:37.350 --> 40:39.250
and what you were doing,

40:39.370 --> 40:40.530
but she loved you.

40:46.070 --> 40:48.290
I just wish she would've told me that.

40:49.690 --> 40:51.570
That's not who she was.

40:54.450 --> 40:56.590
She never asked me to stay
home and take care of you.

40:56.760 --> 40:58.430
I made a choice.

40:58.490 --> 41:00.270
I never even got a thank-you.

41:07.790 --> 41:09.190
Thank you.

41:10.310 --> 41:11.590
For everything.

41:15.770 --> 41:16.990
Do you want to come in?

41:17.030 --> 41:20.070
- We cooking breakfast.
- No. Not today.

41:21.010 --> 41:22.390
Okay.

41:24.790 --> 41:25.950
Blanca?

41:27.390 --> 41:29.210
You're the best parts of her.

42:17.250 --> 42:19.390
_

42:21.610 --> 42:23.310
We need one cup of milk.

42:23.410 --> 42:25.730
Okay, here you go.

42:25.740 --> 42:28.450
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:28.550 --> 42:30.290
Good job.

42:31.130 --> 42:33.470
- All done.
- Oh, don't forget the fruit.

42:37.860 --> 42:39.760
I love you, Mami.

42:39.770 --> 42:41.760
Mm. How much do you love me?

42:41.860 --> 42:43.710
This much!

42:43.750 --> 42:46.910
- Wow.
- More than the whole wide world.

42:46.930 --> 42:49.700
Ooh, hoo, hoo.

42:50.690 --> 42:52.470
Will you love me forever?

42:53.870 --> 42:56.150
I will love you forever.

42:56.250 --> 42:58.010
Don't ever forget that.

43:08.870 --> 43:10.760
Blanca, I need your help.

43:10.770 --> 43:12.960
This batter is still thick.

43:16.900 --> 43:18.330
Did you put milk?

43:20.290 --> 43:23.230
Oh, my goodness. I forgot the milk.

43:39.850 --> 43:41.350
Ah, that's enough.

43:41.530 --> 43:43.150
Give me this.

43:47.530 --> 43:49.366
- Look at that.
- It was just what it was missing.

43:49.390 --> 43:51.390
Get ready for some tasty pancakes.

43:51.410 --> 43:53.050
Nah, you can't forget the fruit.

43:53.090 --> 43:54.526
I don't want no plain old dry

43:54.550 --> 43:57.470
pancakes for Mother's Day.

43:57.670 --> 43:59.090
Ah, look at this.

44:00.590 --> 44:02.030
I love you, Mother.

44:04.110 --> 44:05.890
I love you, too.

44:06.370 --> 44:07.730
Forever.

44:09.680 --> 44:12.270
And don't eat the fruit now.
We got to put it in here.

44:12.290 --> 44:13.966
No, but it's so good, like,
you just cut these...

44:13.990 --> 44:15.370
- Stop being greedy.
- No.

44:44.810 --> 44:47.400
Wow. I am into everything

44:47.410 --> 44:48.990
about what you're looking like tonight.

44:49.190 --> 44:50.840
Mommy's gonna go now, okay?

44:52.710 --> 44:55.450
No, no, no, don't. You'll
mess up my makeup.

44:55.650 --> 44:58.370
Seems a shame to waste all
that work on girls' night out.

44:58.410 --> 44:59.860
Thank you for hiring that car.

44:59.960 --> 45:02.820
You know Mary Anne gets wasted,
and they've got checkpoints

45:02.830 --> 45:04.620
- up and down the Turnpike.
- Yeah.

45:04.730 --> 45:07.190
You've been so great to
me these past few months.

45:07.750 --> 45:09.410
Put whatever you want
on the credit card.

45:09.630 --> 45:10.830
Thanks.

45:10.930 --> 45:13.030
Don't wait up. Hey.

45:13.130 --> 45:14.770
Love you. Be good, okay?

45:15.510 --> 45:16.930
Have fun tonight.

45:38.230 --> 45:39.550
Hello?

45:39.630 --> 45:41.040
Just tell me what you need, quick.

45:41.050 --> 45:42.070
I'm late for the ball.

45:42.870 --> 45:44.190
Oh. Excuse me?

45:45.350 --> 45:46.510
You a cop?

45:46.700 --> 45:47.770
No.

45:49.170 --> 45:51.020
All I got is weed, nothing hard.

45:51.110 --> 45:53.540
I'm-I'm looking for a girl named Angel.

45:53.640 --> 45:54.750
Does she live here?

45:54.790 --> 45:55.870
How you know her?

45:55.930 --> 45:58.010
Um, from work.

45:58.070 --> 45:59.850
Oh. Well, she's not here right now,

45:59.870 --> 46:01.606
but I'm gonna go see her if
you want to come with me.

46:01.630 --> 46:04.130
Is it far? I-I have a town
car waiting downstairs.

46:04.210 --> 46:05.670
Oh, shit.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.320
We traveling in style.

46:08.330 --> 46:10.560
They all gonna flip when they
see me jumping out a limo.

46:13.960 --> 46:16.330
The category is Labels.

46:16.410 --> 46:19.970
I need to see head-to-toe
realness, honey.

46:20.070 --> 46:22.480
And I don't want to see
none of those knockoffs

46:22.490 --> 46:24.670
y'all be getting down at Canal Street.

46:24.770 --> 46:26.740
Y'all know what I'm talking about.

46:26.840 --> 46:29.270
Oh, yes, looky here.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.500
And where is Miss Cherry

46:31.510 --> 46:34.840
headed in her YSL pump?

46:34.850 --> 46:37.510
And her Dior suit?

46:37.590 --> 46:40.690
It ain't the PTA meeting,
that's for damn sure.

46:40.790 --> 46:42.170
Judges, your scores?

46:42.180 --> 46:44.290
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

46:45.610 --> 46:47.590
Yo. You coming?

47:05.230 --> 47:07.810
Thought you were asking about
my daytime activities.

47:10.210 --> 47:12.290
Oh. Bitch.

47:12.950 --> 47:15.650
Who let in all this real fish?

47:15.690 --> 47:18.630
Honey, that nose, she's cunt.

47:18.730 --> 47:21.390
Who is your doctor?

47:23.770 --> 47:25.600
The category is...

47:25.700 --> 47:29.150
Mother-Daughter Realness.

47:29.250 --> 47:32.170
Each mother must introduce her daughter

47:32.330 --> 47:35.310
at a debutante's ball.

47:35.470 --> 47:38.540
And you bitches better be
wearing spring colors.

47:38.910 --> 47:42.190
First up, House of Abundance.

47:46.510 --> 47:49.510
Oh, whoa!

47:49.650 --> 47:51.350
Bitch!

47:51.970 --> 47:54.460
She's back!

47:54.750 --> 47:57.390
All the way from Thailand.

47:58.210 --> 48:00.710
And she's looking rejuvenated,

48:00.750 --> 48:02.920
and she's looking refreshed.

48:02.930 --> 48:05.870
The legendary Elektra Abundance.

48:06.430 --> 48:09.910
Looking like a tall glass of lemonade.

48:09.990 --> 48:13.480
Giving us daffodil realness.

48:13.580 --> 48:16.650
Giving us sunflower.

48:16.750 --> 48:18.830
Sun power!

48:18.930 --> 48:21.690
Making the little things grow.

48:22.230 --> 48:24.360
Oh!

48:24.390 --> 48:25.660
You see?

48:25.760 --> 48:27.790
Miss Thing with the reveal.

48:30.230 --> 48:32.170
Oh, they're giving us story.

48:32.250 --> 48:34.330
They're giving us narrative.

48:34.410 --> 48:37.960
The divas are serving us
Buckingham Palace high tea

48:37.990 --> 48:40.570
while the rest of you don't
know nothing but Lipton's

48:40.680 --> 48:42.470
from the garden.

48:43.150 --> 48:45.650
Come on, judges, give them their scores.

48:46.290 --> 48:49.970
Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten.

48:49.990 --> 48:53.050
Across the board!

48:53.130 --> 48:56.030
Mother of the Year is a
mere three months away.

48:56.110 --> 49:00.030
Miss Elektra is poised to
snag the title once more.

49:00.110 --> 49:02.630
Any competitors?

49:02.670 --> 49:04.460
Evangelistas?

49:04.570 --> 49:07.490
The judges ate up what Abundance served.

49:08.350 --> 49:09.540
Y'all ready?

49:11.770 --> 49:14.410
House of Evangelista!

49:17.290 --> 49:19.450
Yes!

49:20.330 --> 49:22.130
Work it out!

49:22.170 --> 49:24.720
Work it out!

49:25.290 --> 49:26.690
Yes!

49:26.710 --> 49:28.990
You better start that train, bitch.

49:29.070 --> 49:32.050
Oh, there's a daughter.

49:32.170 --> 49:35.560
Here comes the daughter: Miss Angel.

49:35.570 --> 49:39.230
Giving us graceful, wispy,

49:39.390 --> 49:42.750
crisp and fresh.

49:42.800 --> 49:45.640
Like a York Peppermint Pattie.

49:52.710 --> 49:55.370
There's competition up
in here these days.

49:55.470 --> 49:58.490
I don't know about you.
Y'all better watch out.

50:00.550 --> 50:02.130
Just so you know,

50:02.390 --> 50:04.810
I don't think you should've
snagged grand prize.

50:05.170 --> 50:07.630
But I do want to congratulate
you on your surgery.

50:07.730 --> 50:09.350
I'm happy for you.

50:09.370 --> 50:11.490
I suppose well wishes,
regardless of how late

50:11.510 --> 50:13.770
they may come, are always adequate.

50:14.230 --> 50:16.600
Though in the future, I prefer
them in the form of a gift.

50:16.700 --> 50:18.670
Preferably, from Saks.

50:32.270 --> 50:33.710
I'm Patty.

50:34.570 --> 50:35.850
Stan's wife.

50:39.770 --> 50:41.350
Can we talk?
