WEBVTT

00:28.862 --> 00:34.409
Oh, I'm so glad you came
to visit me, Johnny.

00:34.492 --> 00:36.286
Me too, Grandma.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.621


00:38.705 --> 00:40.790
Grandma, it's the Big Bad Wolf!

00:40.874 --> 00:42.667
He's coming to eat you! We'd better--

00:42.751 --> 00:44.753


00:44.836 --> 00:48.339
Grandma had to go.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.507
Oh, but don't worry.

00:49.591 --> 00:52.719
You'll be seeing her soon.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.555


00:56.347 --> 00:58.183
Wolfy get Grandma again?

00:58.266 --> 01:01.394
Mom told me for years that Grandma
was safe in the closet,

01:01.478 --> 01:05.065
and the wolf simply liked wearing
old ladies clothes, when in fact…

01:05.148 --> 01:07.776
He ate Granny up like a parfait!

01:07.859 --> 01:09.527
It's a terrifying story.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.529
Maybe Granny had it coming.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.032
Think about all the psycho
old ladies in this book.

01:14.115 --> 01:17.285
They give out poison apples
and build candy houses

01:17.368 --> 01:18.745
to get you to go inside.

01:18.828 --> 01:22.040
Then you realize<i> you're</i> the candy!
Heh heh heh. Heh.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.958
-I'm not helping, am I?

01:24.751 --> 01:28.213
Johnny, you have to sleep,
or your brain won't function properly.

01:28.296 --> 01:31.257
But every time I do,
I dream the Big Bad Wolf eats me.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.592
Sorry, Johnny.

01:32.675 --> 01:33.843
But now that you're older,

01:33.927 --> 01:36.888
you realize fairytales
are not sweet stories

01:36.971 --> 01:39.766
but strong warnings
about the dangers of life.

01:39.849 --> 01:41.851
And you can get rid of the nightmares

01:41.935 --> 01:45.563
so Johnny and constantly-woken-up-dog
can sleep?

01:45.647 --> 01:48.274
Well, his subconscious
is in a hyper-anxious state

01:48.358 --> 01:50.109
which is fueling the nightmares.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.904
But our new Dream Chamber
will create a dream

01:52.987 --> 01:56.366
where you can confront
and defeat the Big Bad Wolf.

01:56.449 --> 01:59.035
Then your brain will rid
itself of night-time stress,

01:59.119 --> 02:00.537
and you'll sleep again.

02:01.704 --> 02:06.459
Up-bup-bup. Can I get a blasty blaster
or some shieldy wolf protection?

02:06.543 --> 02:09.170
We've loaded a Nightmare Blaster
into your temporal lobe.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.256
It will be there when you arrive.

02:12.090 --> 02:17.178
Up-bup-bup. There's no way I'm letting
Johnny go to Fairytale Land by himself.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.429
Thanks, buddy.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.141
Now, dream us up, sisters!

02:27.522 --> 02:30.525
-Wow. It's pretty!
-And look!

02:32.694 --> 02:34.696
Now we just have to find Grandma's house,

02:34.779 --> 02:36.030
wait for the Big Bad Wolf,

02:36.114 --> 02:38.366
and ka-blam, nightmares over.

02:38.449 --> 02:42.620
Right, then we find the candy house,
stop the crazy old lady inside,

02:42.704 --> 02:44.247
then eat the house.

02:44.330 --> 02:47.917
Wait, did you come to my nightmare
just so you could eat a candy house?

02:48.001 --> 02:51.212
The entire house is made of candy.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.463
I'm a dog, Johnny!

02:52.547 --> 02:55.383
We are bred to protect, sleep, and snack.

02:55.466 --> 03:00.388
Excuse me. Would either of you
like a tasty apple?

03:01.723 --> 03:04.100
Who do you think I am, lady?
Red Riding Hood?

03:04.183 --> 03:05.560
I know you're a witch.

03:05.643 --> 03:07.645
Then how about a cookie?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.731
-Yum!
-Dukey! No!

03:10.940 --> 03:13.568
-Ah! Dukey!
-I'm fine.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.029
But you died.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.281
Then I woke up
and your sisters sent me back.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.033
It's a dream, remember?

03:20.116 --> 03:23.453
No… It's a fairy tale!

03:28.416 --> 03:29.792
Oh, that's new.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.796
OK! Which way to Grandma's house?

03:36.341 --> 03:37.550
She might know.

03:40.011 --> 03:42.138
Hey, you're Red Riding Hood!

03:42.222 --> 03:44.474
With her famous basket of goodies.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.518
And you're two lost boys in the wood.

03:47.602 --> 03:52.190
But wow, what big ears you have.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.858
Cos I'm a dog, not a boy.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.068
Now, what's in the basket?

03:55.151 --> 03:57.987
And what big eyes you have.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.113
Yeah, cos…

03:59.197 --> 04:02.408
Do you not see the fur and the no pants?

04:02.492 --> 04:03.952
Now! What's in the basket?

04:04.035 --> 04:05.536
It's a beet loaf.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.207
I'm on a plant-based diet,
and it's 100 percent meatless.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.168
And 200 percent disgusting.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.671
Wait. I smell something else.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.880
Is it the Big Bad Wolf?

04:15.964 --> 04:16.881
Gumdrops.

04:16.965 --> 04:21.302
Which means the candy house
is nearby, so…

04:21.386 --> 04:23.179
good luck with the wolf thing!

04:23.263 --> 04:26.140
What a big nose that boy has, too!

04:26.224 --> 04:29.102
Uh-huh. Now, can you get me
to your grandma's house?

04:29.185 --> 04:31.145
I gotta stop the wolf before he eats her.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.272
Of course!

04:35.566 --> 04:38.278
We're too late.
The wolf ate Grandma!

04:38.361 --> 04:40.363
No, he didn't, silly.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.199
Grandma's right there on the porch.

04:43.908 --> 04:48.871
And Grandma's growling
cos she's still hungry.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.624
Well, in that case, I suggest you try…

04:51.708 --> 04:53.418
the Nightmare Blaster!

04:54.460 --> 04:57.630
Wait. I only get one blast?

04:59.882 --> 05:01.551
So, how'd it go?

05:01.634 --> 05:04.554
Terrible! I was about to eat
a marshmallow mailbox,

05:04.637 --> 05:06.472
then nightmare boy woke me up.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.976
You know the old lady who built the house
wants to eat you, right?

05:10.059 --> 05:12.312
That's why you never go inside.

05:12.395 --> 05:16.274
You abandoned me.
And you only gave me one blast?

05:16.357 --> 05:19.277
Yeah, cos it's only one wolf.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.156
In his defense, he sparked a witch
who killed me with a cookie.

05:23.239 --> 05:26.242
Just gimme another blast
and dream me so I can stop the wolf,

05:26.326 --> 05:28.786
not get eaten, and get some sleep!

05:28.870 --> 05:33.750
Me too. Cos that is the last time
I let a wolf eat my best friend.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.877
One more nightmare blast.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.838
-And one more dream coming up.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.472
OK, our cover's blown.

05:47.555 --> 05:50.725
So the Big Bad Wolf will be expecting me
at Grandma's house.

05:50.808 --> 05:54.062
Right. So I say we lure him
to the candy house.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.814
He goes inside,
eats the lady who built it…

05:56.898 --> 05:58.191
How ironic is that?

05:58.274 --> 06:01.194
Then you blast him and I eat the house!

06:01.277 --> 06:02.904
Enough with the snacks!

06:02.987 --> 06:04.864
But a food trap's not bad.

06:04.947 --> 06:07.825
What else do Big Bad Wolves like to eat?

06:07.909 --> 06:11.621
You want us to let two strangers
into our brick house?

06:11.704 --> 06:14.916
Do you know what happened
to our other houses?

06:14.999 --> 06:16.375
We do.

06:16.459 --> 06:18.961
Trust us. We're protecting you.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.589
Let me tell you something
about Fairytale Land.

06:21.672 --> 06:25.802
If you want to stay alive…
don't trust anybody.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.014
Let's try this again.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.893
I'm gonna huff and I'm gonna puff
and I'm gonna--

06:33.976 --> 06:36.813
Sweet dreams, wolf. For me, that is.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.857
Whoa, hold on, kid. Who are you?

06:39.941 --> 06:41.234
I'm Johnny Test.

06:41.317 --> 06:44.278
And you're gonna stop eating
Grandma and me.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.530
-And pigs!

06:45.613 --> 06:48.449
Then I sleep happily ever after.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.160
I didn't eat Grandma or you.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.704
Or the pigs, since they built
that new house,

06:53.788 --> 06:55.498
that I hate, by the way!

06:55.581 --> 06:58.960
Maybe they should've called you
the Big "Bad at Lying" Wolf.

07:01.045 --> 07:04.423
Yes! I defeated the Big Bad Wolf!

07:04.507 --> 07:06.092
Hooray!

07:06.175 --> 07:09.846
No, you defeated<i> a</i> Big Bad Wolf.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.890
-Grandma, what are you doing out of bed?

07:12.974 --> 07:16.727
And who's that man next to you
with the big eyes?

07:16.811 --> 07:19.313
Please take her inside
before she gets eaten.

07:20.231 --> 07:24.527
There's three wolves
for three different fairy tales.

07:24.610 --> 07:27.738
The Three Little Pigs,
Little Red Riding Hood…

07:27.822 --> 07:30.241
And the Wolf
and the Seven Little Kids.

07:32.076 --> 07:35.079
A mother goat leaves
her seven kids at home,

07:35.163 --> 07:36.247
and I eat them.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.332
But later, I realize they tricked me,

07:38.416 --> 07:40.626
and I ate seven stones instead, and…

07:40.710 --> 07:42.170
Nobody knows that story!

07:42.253 --> 07:43.880
Well, it's a good story!

07:43.963 --> 07:48.468
And in it, I'm just as hungry
as the other wolves.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.012
Uh, next time, ask for more blasts.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.057
Let me guess.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.727
You used the blaster
to blow up the candy house

07:57.810 --> 07:59.353
to avoid going inside.

07:59.437 --> 08:03.733
But as candy rained all around you,
the wolf showed up and ate you.

08:03.816 --> 08:08.488
No. But the blowing-up-the-house thing
could work.

08:08.571 --> 08:10.531
There are three wolves in Fairytale Land,

08:10.615 --> 08:15.077
so forget the blaster
and give me super mutant powers.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.621
Oh, and some eyeglasses.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.206
Fine.

08:19.749 --> 08:23.419
Now hopefully, finally, sweet dreams.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.384
Perfect! We're back at Grandma's house.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.471
But this time, we're early.

08:34.597 --> 08:38.184
Oh, where is my sweet Red Riding Hood?

08:38.267 --> 08:40.144
Grandma. Hide in the closet now!

08:41.437 --> 08:44.023
Well, look who's back.

08:44.106 --> 08:47.527
Wait. I thought you eat Grandma,
<i>then</i> put on her clothes.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.111
No.

08:49.195 --> 08:53.282
And it looks like someone
forgot to bring their blaster.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.284
Oh, I don't need one in this dream.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.662
He has mutant powers now.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.205
Grandma, get back in bed.

08:59.288 --> 09:03.334
And wow, what big eyes!

09:03.417 --> 09:07.213
Red, stop! And try these. Please!

09:10.299 --> 09:12.635
Wolves!

09:12.718 --> 09:14.804
Hide, lost boy and dog!

09:14.887 --> 09:18.224
No need, cos this
is no longer my nightmare.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.684
It's yours.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.353
Oh, I don't think so.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.568
Then again…

09:30.653 --> 09:32.655
Ow! Ow! Ow!

09:37.410 --> 09:39.161
Yeah, I'm outta here.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.915
Ha! Ya missed!

09:44.792 --> 09:47.253
That was so cool!

09:47.336 --> 09:49.130
Now, what do we do with this one?

09:49.213 --> 09:50.381
Hmm.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.757
Tails, we let him live…

09:52.633 --> 09:55.261
but heads, he disappears forever.

09:59.807 --> 10:01.851
Huh. I guess he stays.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.144
But listen up, wolf.

10:03.227 --> 10:07.106
You are never to eat Grandma
or little pigs or seven kids again.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.107
Got it?

10:08.190 --> 10:10.067
But we'll starve.

10:10.151 --> 10:14.947
Fairy tales have nothing else
but candy houses, poison apples,

10:15.031 --> 10:17.533
and have you seen that thing
in Red's basket?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.493
I did. It's upsetting.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.621
Hey! Don't knock it till you try it!

10:25.875 --> 10:27.251
It's not bad.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.544
It's not bad at all!

10:29.420 --> 10:31.213
And if there's good food
in Fairytale Land,

10:31.297 --> 10:34.133
you'll stop eating everyone,
including me, right?

10:34.216 --> 10:35.092
Duh!

10:37.887 --> 10:41.515
Here's your Three Pigs
Beet Loaf Burrito, trademark.

10:42.224 --> 10:43.726
Thanks, Johnny.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.728
Yeah, thanks, Johnny.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.441
So, we're still dreaming, right?

10:50.524 --> 10:51.567
Yeah?

10:55.196 --> 10:58.032
Well, they haven't woken up
screaming in a while.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.201
Should we just let them sleep?

11:00.284 --> 11:02.244
They do look happy. Hmm.

11:02.328 --> 11:06.040
C'mon. You're a super mutant.
You can do it.

11:06.123 --> 11:09.001
-Fine, I'll try.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.468
Yes! It worked!

11:18.886 --> 11:21.514
Take that, you evil
candy-house-making old…
