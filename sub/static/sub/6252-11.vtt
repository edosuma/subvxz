and the ability to act
outside human control.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.813
That wasn’t his job.
He should’ve waited for a green light.

34:31.904 --> 34:34.520
Well, he thought
he was doing
the right thing.

34:34.615 --> 34:37.482
- You’re glad he did it, aren’t you?
- No. I don’t condone it.

34:37.576 --> 34:40.113
But you admire him.
You hold two beliefs at once.

34:40.204 --> 34:43.071
- It’s called cognitive dissonance.
- No, I understand him.

- Caroline hollered at me.

34:52.675 --> 34:55.587

- We got a hit on a possible alias.

34:55.678 --> 34:58.841
- Gary Gray.
- That’s a famous British sniper.

34:58.931 --> 35:02.765
Who died a hundred years ago
but somehow created
a bank account yesterday...

35:02.851 --> 35:05.934
to cash a check for $2 million
hours after the murder.

35:06.063 --> 35:07.724
Who wrote him the check?
Don’t know.

35:07.815 --> 35:10.898
But James Kent withdrew
the same amount yesterday.

35:10.985 --> 35:13.897
James Kent.
He’s the father
of two of the victims.

35:13.988 --> 35:17.526
$2 million is the ransom
she wanted for his boys.

35:21.662 --> 35:23.573
I didn’t kill anyone,
Agent Booth.

35:23.664 --> 35:25.575
Yeah, but you
paid the man who did.
You see that?

35:25.666 --> 35:28.908
That’s your signature on the
front of the cashier’s check.
Am I right?

35:29.003 --> 35:30.288
$2 million
you paid him?

35:30.379 --> 35:31.789
Your hit man killed
an innocent woman.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.131
The Grave Digger
wasn’t the only victim.

35:33.215 --> 35:36.423
Tracy Leveque.
She never hurt anyone.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.971
I didn’t know
anything about that.

35:43.058 --> 35:45.390
She was killed
for access to her apartment.

35:46.395 --> 35:48.101
Then he did that on his own.

35:48.230 --> 35:50.266
Who’s he?
I don’t know.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.393
You’re under arrest for
conspiracy to commit murder.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.599
If I were you, I would cooperate.

35:53.694 --> 35:56.652
- I don’t know his name.
- What does he look like?

35:56.739 --> 35:59.355
I didn’t see him!

36:00.326 --> 36:01.816
I dropped a check off...

36:01.910 --> 36:04.196
in a restroom
in a public park.

36:04.288 --> 36:06.404
- You never met him?
- Not face to face.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.910
- How did you find him?
- I didn’t. He found me.

36:10.627 --> 36:12.913
I got a phone call.

36:13.005 --> 36:17.544
A man asks me
if I’ll pay him $2 million
to kill the Grave Digger.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.177
He chose the victim?
Yeah.

36:19.261 --> 36:21.297
And he set the price.

36:22.639 --> 36:25.802
And I thought,
“Hell, yeah.”

36:25.893 --> 36:29.101
I mean, he’s— he’s doing
a service to society.

36:29.188 --> 36:32.476
The Grave Digger
killed my two sons.

36:32.566 --> 36:34.306
I paid him.

36:35.444 --> 36:37.651
I was happy to.

36:39.406 --> 36:41.192
Witness saw Broadsky
on the news.

36:41.283 --> 36:45.242
He swears it’s the same guy
he saw in a gun shop off I-64.

36:45.329 --> 36:46.535
Lookser
the middle of nowhere.

36:46.622 --> 36:47.737
This guy likes
the middle of nowhere.

36:47.831 --> 36:48.991
He likes to hide.
He likes to hunt.

36:49.083 --> 36:50.994
History suggests...

36:51.085 --> 36:53.952
that the notorious assassin
seeks foreign asylum.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.958
Those guys are on the run.
This guy, he’s on the offense.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.664
Is it possible
to search the area?

36:58.759 --> 37:00.465
Tree canopy blocks
the view from the air.

37:00.594 --> 37:03.586
Property ownership.
Right.
Thanks.

37:03.680 --> 37:07.719
So I ran a check
on the 60 private
plots of land in that area.

37:07.810 --> 37:10.096
What if we
recruit volunteers
for a ground search?

37:10.187 --> 37:12.599
Like a grid search
for evidence?

37:12.689 --> 37:14.270
Search for
missing children, yeah.

37:14.358 --> 37:18.317
But the search for a man
who killed... public enemy
number one, I doubt it.

37:18.404 --> 37:19.940
What is it?

37:20.030 --> 37:22.897
Broadsky purchased land—
10 acres off the highway.

of another sniper?

37:26.328 --> 37:28.444

Let me see the hands, Jake.

38:08.537 --> 38:11.279
- Where’s your gun?
- That’s not why I’m here.

38:11.373 --> 38:12.829
I just wanna talk.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.457

It’s over, Jake.
We both know it’s over.

38:17.963 --> 38:21.376
- So what do I have to do to bring you in?
- You can’t do anything.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.082
Not without a warrant.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.336
I’m watching you too, Seeley.

38:28.557 --> 38:31.219
- Why’d you kill the Grave Digger?
- I didn’t.

38:32.811 --> 38:36.019
But whoever did,
I applaud him.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.346
What about Tracy Leveque?

38:37.441 --> 38:39.306
She didn’t do
anything to anyone.

38:39.401 --> 38:40.902
Collateral damage.

38:40.986 --> 38:44.228
Maybe she was warned to stay away
and maybe she didn’t listen.

38:47.493 --> 38:50.530
I should go.
I just wanted to say hello.

38:50.621 --> 38:53.203
Wait, Jake. We can work
somethin’ out here.

We’re the same, Seeley.
We both wanna do the right thing.

I’m warning you.

You never could go for the kill,
not if there was any doubt.

He just took off.
I wasn’t ready for the terrain.

40:37.519 --> 40:40.056
Chasin’ after him,
I fell and hurt my leg...

40:40.147 --> 40:42.058
and dislocated my shoulder
from the explosion.

waited for me.
