WEBVTT

00:26.560 --> 00:27.999
- No.
- (GUNSHOT)

00:29.520 --> 00:31.159
(SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN)

00:31.280 --> 00:32.319
(GASPS)

00:35.240 --> 00:37.119
Angelo. No!

00:37.240 --> 00:39.079
I'm so sorry, Jack.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.559
- In the future, are we together?
- We can't be

00:41.680 --> 00:43.359
cos one day you're going to die
and I won't.

00:43.480 --> 00:46.559
Then we forget the future
and we make a promise.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.119
I'm sorry, Angelo.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.079
This is the story of my life.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.679
Captain Harkness,
the last mortal man.

00:53.800 --> 00:55.399
You'll want to come with me,

00:55.520 --> 00:58.799
because I can take you to the one man
who knows how the miracle began.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.039
Who's that?

01:00.160 --> 01:01.399
Angelo.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.519
Angelo Colasanto.

01:24.760 --> 01:28.039
They're with me. They've agreed
to leave their weapons behind.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.439
- But Esther's going to stay outside.
- Why? What for?

01:30.560 --> 01:33.319
She's going to keep an open relay
to a hard drive back in Los Angeles.

01:33.440 --> 01:35.879
If we go through those doors
and disappear, then we have a record.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.319
OK? So tell your goons
to leave her alone.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.239
Come on, Angelo's inside.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.919
He talked about you
all the time, Jack.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.679
His immortal man in old New York.
He never forgot.

01:51.800 --> 01:53.159
You telling me
the whole world got screwed

01:53.280 --> 01:54.439
because two gay guys had a hissy fit?

01:54.560 --> 01:56.999
- Rex, get back in your cave.
- Come on, give me a break.

01:57.120 --> 02:00.279
You inspired him.
You proved immortality was possible.

02:00.400 --> 02:05.159
And he devoted the rest of his life
to finding out how to live forever.

02:05.280 --> 02:06.879
And he did it?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.959
He's still alive? He's still young?

02:09.080 --> 02:10.879
Oh, yes, he's still alive.

02:12.520 --> 02:16.079
Angelo Colasanto
is still very much alive...

02:16.200 --> 02:18.359
but he's not young.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.479
My grandfather waited
all this time to live forever.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.639
And his wish came true...

02:29.400 --> 02:30.399
...too late.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.079
What's wrong with him?

03:01.200 --> 03:03.799
At his age? Just about everything.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.519
You can leave us alone, thanks.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.199
Of course, ma'am.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.239
What happened to your eye?

03:15.120 --> 03:16.559
I was just born with it.

03:20.920 --> 03:21.959
It's him.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.439
You must be horrified.

03:23.560 --> 03:26.759
- Why would you say that?
- Well, he's grown so old.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.079
That's how I see the whole world.

03:30.680 --> 03:31.639
He's still young compared to me.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.159
This is for Esther.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.679
Just keeping an open line
to make sure we're all safe.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.759
After everything I've heard about
Torchwood technology,

03:37.880 --> 03:39.839
you're going to rely on
an open handset?

03:39.960 --> 03:41.359
Yeah, well,
we had to leave LA in a hurry,

03:41.480 --> 03:43.679
thanks to someone I could mention.

03:43.800 --> 03:46.319
REX: Anyway, what the hell's going on
with the stock market?

03:47.600 --> 03:49.239
They're falling.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.119
It's been inevitable
ever since Miracle Day,

03:51.240 --> 03:53.639
which I reckon is part of the plan.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.599
So you put a gun to my daughter's head
for what, for this?!

03:55.720 --> 03:58.879
- So you get your revenge on Jack?
- We weren't trying to hurt you.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.519
I was carrying out
my grandfather's final wish...

04:01.640 --> 04:02.559
to keep you safe.

04:02.680 --> 04:03.959
- So you don'twant him dead, then.
- W-wait..

04:04.080 --> 04:05.279
Do you mean,
you were protecting me?

04:05.400 --> 04:06.439
Hell of a way of going about it.

04:06.560 --> 04:10.479
There's a crucial distinction.
My grandfather cared for you. I don't.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.079
You might be important
in some way we've yet to work out.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.759
So it's best to keep you intact.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.519
But that's as far as
the sentiment goes.

04:18.640 --> 04:21.119
So why the hell, you know...

04:21.240 --> 04:23.559
Bollocks. Start again.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.479
Any chance of a drink?

04:25.600 --> 04:27.959
I could murder
a pint of bitter right now.

04:28.080 --> 04:30.719
Thanks, Gwen. I'll have a vodka.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.959
These are all of you.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.279
Some of these are...

04:43.400 --> 04:44.959
That's Torchwood.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.839
That's Cardiff.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.039
When was that?

04:50.160 --> 04:51.759
- The '70s.
- A moustache?

04:51.880 --> 04:54.039
My God, Jack.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.599
He watched you for decades.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.479
But he never made contact.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.919
You may not be ashamed
of being old,

05:01.040 --> 05:02.559
but...he was.

05:02.680 --> 05:05.479
Hold on now. He didn't cause this?

05:05.600 --> 05:06.839
Angelo didn't cause the miracle?

05:06.960 --> 05:10.439
No, he lived this long
through natural means.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.759
He kept his body at a temperature
two degrees below normal,

05:13.880 --> 05:17.999
he controlled his caloric intake,
kept his blood pressure below 1 1 0.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.039
- Does that work?
- Oh, yes.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.839
Prolonging life is simple.

05:21.960 --> 05:25.399
But no-one's worked out how to make
a profit at it, so it's not advertised.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.639
And the whole time
he was looking for immortality?

05:27.760 --> 05:29.959
It's not as impossible as it sounds.

05:30.080 --> 05:34.319
You are not the only remarkable thing
on this Earth, Jack.

05:35.760 --> 05:37.559
Consider the jellyfish.

05:37.680 --> 05:41.199
The species turritopsis nutricula
is considered to be immortal.

05:41.320 --> 05:44.559
Its cells undergo a process
called transdifferentiation.

05:44.680 --> 05:48.639
Quite simply, it can revert to
a younger state, and grow old again.

05:48.760 --> 05:50.839
And then repeat, without limit.

05:50.960 --> 05:56.039
It's possible there are
individual jellyfish upon this planet

05:56.160 --> 05:58.759
that have existed
for thousands and thousands of years.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.119
I'm not as special as I thought.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.719
You never were.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.999
Even within the human body,
cancer cells

06:05.120 --> 06:08.559
are immortal. Stem cells,
in theory, they can divide forever.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.559
And this is the research
that Angelo investigated.

06:13.680 --> 06:14.999
Well, they all did,

06:15.120 --> 06:17.679
because my grandfather wasn't alone.

06:17.800 --> 06:19.719
- Who were the others?
- Well, the story says

06:19.840 --> 06:24.319
that it started with three men,
each representing a different family.

06:24.440 --> 06:27.559
And when you were being murdered
over and over again,

06:27.680 --> 06:30.799
these three men came
to witness your resurrection.

06:32.320 --> 06:33.399
I saw them.

06:36.280 --> 06:37.839
They made a deal.

06:45.840 --> 06:49.399
They formed an alliance to purchase
the power of resurrection.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.559
And when you escaped,

06:51.680 --> 06:54.239
the three families swore
that they'd find the gift again.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.639
What were their names?

06:55.760 --> 06:59.999
The Ablemarch family,
the Costerdane family and the Frines.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.799
Ablemarch, Costerdane, Frines.
Did you get that?

07:03.920 --> 07:06.239
Ablemarch, Costerdane and...

07:06.360 --> 07:08.559
- Is Coster with a T-E-R?
- Is Coster with a T-E-R?

07:08.680 --> 07:11.199
- Yeah, T-E-R. And...
- Spell Frines.

07:12.240 --> 07:15.559
- Could you spell Frines?
- F-R-I-N-E-S.

07:15.680 --> 07:18.079
F-R-I-N-E-S.

07:18.200 --> 07:21.159
Trace 'em. I want you to find
every member of those three families.

07:21.280 --> 07:23.199
Rex, this is nine decades later.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.999
Look, I don't care
if it's 500,000 people.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.359
I want you to find them all...now.

07:30.960 --> 07:32.759
So...what happened then?

07:32.880 --> 07:34.959
1 928 - what did they do next?

07:35.080 --> 07:37.079
Well, they lost Jack,
but they still had his blood.

07:38.280 --> 07:41.199
No, no, no, no!

07:42.200 --> 07:44.679
(SHE SPEAKS ITALIAN)

07:46.000 --> 07:47.039
I thought they were draining it away...

07:47.160 --> 07:49.719
but they were collecting it.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.519
All they had to do
was figure out how to use it.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.839
But that doesn't work.
There's nothing special

07:53.960 --> 07:56.399
about my blood in itself.
That's not what made me immortal.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.599
Then why would the three families
want to kill you?

07:58.720 --> 07:59.679
I don't know.

07:59.800 --> 08:03.919
Whatever they were planning,
my grandfather wasn't included.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.959
I think they considered him...
inappropriate.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.879
(LAUGHS) What's inappropriate?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.599
He loved a man.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.359
He did go on
to have a family of his own,

08:12.480 --> 08:14.799
and I think he loved
my grandmother very much,

08:14.920 --> 08:16.439
but he never lied about you, Jack.

08:16.560 --> 08:21.759
And I think that Ablemarch,
Costerdane and Frines

08:21.880 --> 08:26.599
found that...a little...unfortunate.

08:26.720 --> 08:30.479
As a result, Angelo was forced
to watch them from afar.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.999
Made enough money,
by the looks of it.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.799
Well, Jack told him enough
to navigate his way

08:34.920 --> 08:36.439
through the 20th century
and make a profit.

08:36.560 --> 08:39.079
But what did these families do
to the world?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.319
They...they started in Manhattan.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.959
80 years later, the whole of the planet
becomes immortal.

08:44.080 --> 08:47.879
- And I become mortal.
- In 1 998 we intercepted a message.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.399
It was just one word - "Blessing".

08:52.360 --> 08:54.079
JACK: We've heard about the Blessing.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.159
They found it. Whatever the Blessing is,
the three families found it.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.919
- Now it's time that we found them.
- GWEN: Mmm.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.799
Esther, you got any news for us?

09:01.920 --> 09:03.599
This is...plain weird.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.759
There's no-one called Ablemarch
or Costerdane or Frines.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.239
I mean, literally,

09:08.360 --> 09:11.839
there's no such names. There's nothing.
It's blank. They don't exist.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.159
REX: Esther? Esther?

09:19.440 --> 09:21.959
Esther? I think there's trouble.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.919
How long till Shapiro gets here?

09:29.040 --> 09:30.559
He was out of the airport
right behind us.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.199
We've got maybe five minutes
till the rest of the CIA descends.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.039
Five minutes should be enough.
Bring her.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.719
We've got to finish this
before the rest of the CIA arrives.

09:38.920 --> 09:40.999
- Shit.
- What is it, Rex? What's happening?

09:41.120 --> 09:42.639
Just tell us where we can find
the three families, quickly.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.559
You'll never find them,
that's the whole point.

09:44.680 --> 09:47.559
They came out of New York with
the motivation of keeping this secret.

09:47.680 --> 09:49.679
Where's the best place
to hide yourself?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.519
- In plain sight.
- Nobody move!

09:51.640 --> 09:53.279
- This is the CIA.
- Everybody, stay where you are.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.159
That's an order. You, with the others.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.839
- Hey...
- Matheson, don't try anything.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.079
We are arresting all of you

09:58.200 --> 10:00.959
for violations
of the Miracle Security Act.

10:01.080 --> 10:05.119
This is the same as treason now, folks.
And I want a word with Rex.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.079
Right now. Secure him.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.479
- Who the hell are you?
- Don't move.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.079
- That's your last warning.
- Brian Friedkin.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.279
Yeah, of course it's Friedkin.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.599
If anyone's working
for the three families, it's him.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.439
That's enough! Keep them covered.

10:16.560 --> 10:19.079
We may have to end this
with an unfortunate number of Category 1 s.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.999
- Get him out. Take him out.
- GWEN: You're not taking him.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.559
- Back down.
- No, you're not.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.799
- Back down!
- No, you're not.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.959
- Back down!
- OK. OK, all right, OK? It's all right.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.199
Well, they've just taken Rex.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.319
- All right.
- OK?

10:29.440 --> 10:30.759
OK. I'm fine. It's fine.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.239
Right. Right.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.439
They're not legitimate CIA.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.839
Done.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.039
(REX GROANS)

10:43.240 --> 10:45.599
All right.
Go out and keep watch for the squad.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.439
Leave me alone with him.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.519
This is gonna have to be quick.

10:51.640 --> 10:54.079
- Shapiro's arriving any minute.
- Right. Right. I get it.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.559
You have to dispose of me
before the rest of the CIA comes in,

10:56.680 --> 10:57.799
finds out what you're up to.

10:57.920 --> 10:59.639
- How did you find us?
- Ten hours ago

10:59.760 --> 11:03.319
Rex made a phone call
to the brother of Dr Vera Juarez

11:03.440 --> 11:04.639
expressing his condolences.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.039
We've been tracking his phone
ever since.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.679
I knew you'd make a mistake
in the end. It's funny, though.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.479
I never thought that sympathy
would draw you out.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.079
Now all I've gotta do is say that
you attacked me and then I pulled my gun.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.599
I wonder which spot is memories

11:18.720 --> 11:20.719
or personality.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.159
Here, please feel free
to piss yourself.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.559
Why's Friedkin inside?
Who put him in the field?

11:27.680 --> 11:29.239
Rex Matheson was his division, sir.

11:29.360 --> 11:30.559
He feels personally responsible.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.079
Yeah, well, he should have waited
for me, the fat-ass.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.439
(WHISPERS) Doesn't make sense.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.599
I mean, Rex?
He'd know they'd be tracing him.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.279
- How much did the families pay you?
- It wasn't about the money.

11:39.400 --> 11:40.759
You can't escape them.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.159
The families don't just pay me.
They own me.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.359
- Who did that?
- They are everywhere.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.999
- They are always.
- What's it doing?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.799
- They are no-one.
- And they are listening.

11:48.920 --> 11:51.639
- What?
- (CHUCKLES)

11:51.760 --> 11:53.919
Oh, Friedkin,
I'm so glad you mentioned money.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.799
That's gonna transmit beautifully.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.519
What do you mean, transmit?
Transmit from where?

11:59.680 --> 12:02.559
You're not wearing a wire,
we already checked.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.359
Ha! He stole them.

12:05.440 --> 12:09.719
Mr Shapiro, you've got a confession
from Brian Friedkin live on air.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.719
- You're lying.
- Oh, yeah? You should read more.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.759
Check the Torchwood file, OK?

12:13.880 --> 12:17.999
I-5 technology transmitting
from a contact lens camera?

12:18.120 --> 12:20.959
Yeah, you see,
once my heart rate hits 1 20,

12:21.080 --> 12:24.719
that's the signal to transmit the image
on every frequency

12:24.840 --> 12:26.879
and on every monitor within 1 00 feet.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.119
You planned this.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.679
Mm. I used my phone on purpose.

12:30.800 --> 12:33.079
I was just waiting
until Torchwood got enough information.

12:33.200 --> 12:35.599
But then, the Colasantos,
they showed their hand,

12:35.720 --> 12:39.919
so I needed to get back inside,
which meant laying a trap for you.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.359
Ahh!

12:41.480 --> 12:43.519
It's over, Friedkin.

12:44.760 --> 12:46.199
It's over.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.079
And you're no killer.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.519
MAN: Agent Friedkin, show yourself!

12:49.640 --> 12:52.359
- Good job.
- Thank you.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.319
Very good job.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.239
Mr Shapiro,

13:11.360 --> 13:13.319
sir, tell me something...

13:13.440 --> 13:17.439
all that time I was on the run,
did you think I was a traitor?

13:18.480 --> 13:19.719
There was evidence,

13:19.840 --> 13:21.759
woven through your records,
going back ten years or more.

13:21.880 --> 13:26.239
Whoever these people are,
they're a lot smarter than Friedkin,

13:26.360 --> 13:28.319
and they're operating on all sorts of
different levels.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.079
Yeah, but now
we've got them on the run.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.359
Maybe.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.679
So...let's start from the beginning.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.079
Exactly what is going on?

13:37.200 --> 13:40.199
- OK, let's see where we are.
- Er, hold on a minute, mate.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.159
Rex, look, I need to know, did you plan
this whole thing from the start?

13:43.280 --> 13:44.599
No, I just improvised
when these Colasanto people appeared.

13:44.720 --> 13:47.039
- You could have warned us.
- People seem to be talking over me,

13:47.160 --> 13:49.959
which is fascinating and rare.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.599
And forbidden.

13:51.720 --> 13:52.759
I'll come back to you.

13:52.880 --> 13:56.039
First of all, we're going to deal
with this Colasanto woman.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.599
The granddaughter Olivia.
Have I got that right?

13:57.720 --> 13:59.719
Yes, and as far as I'm aware,

13:59.840 --> 14:03.919
the CIA does not have the authority
to operate on American soil.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.639
- Get her out of here.
- This is my property.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.239
Take her to the safe house.
Tell her to line up her lawyers,

14:07.360 --> 14:09.999
so I can piss on them long and hard.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.159
So, these are the Torchwood clowns?

14:12.280 --> 14:15.559
Torchwood did more to piece this together
than the entire CIA!

14:15.680 --> 14:18.079
You're that English girl, Cooper.
Have I got that right?

14:18.200 --> 14:20.039
No, I'm not English
and I'm not a girl.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.359
Gwen, this is Allen Shapiro.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.559
- (SOFTLY) Don't. Really, don't.
- Well, he's not scaring me.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.079
Hello.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.359
I am sick of her already.
Can we deport her? Let's deport her.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.359
- Hey, hey, hey, leave her alone.
- Don't you dare.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.199
- Don't you dare.
- Sorry, sir.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.719
With all due respect, Gwen Cooper

14:34.840 --> 14:36.759
has proven herself
to be extremely useful.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.399
I think it's worth keeping her
on our side.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.159
- Did you sleep with her?
- Pardon me?!

14:41.280 --> 14:42.319
No, sir, I did not.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.439
Because most women that bitter,
you've slept with.

14:47.200 --> 14:48.799
Did you make that mistake?

14:48.920 --> 14:50.279
No.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.119
No, sir, I did not.

14:52.240 --> 14:55.199
Esther Drummond. Rex said
you did a good job out in the field.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.199
- Thank you, sir.
- In my opinion

14:57.320 --> 14:59.599
you deserted your post.
I'm docking your pay.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.759
And what is it with you, Red Baron?

15:01.880 --> 15:03.559
- You got Snoopy up your ass?
- (CHUCKLES)

15:03.680 --> 15:04.959
(GIGGLES) That's funny.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.199
While you're wasting time, Mr Shapiro,
we've got the names of the people

15:07.320 --> 15:09.399
who are responsible
for causing the miracle.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.279
I suggest we get to work.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.919
Torchwood is gonna work for the CIA?

15:13.040 --> 15:16.439
I think the CIA can work for Torchwood,
if you're lucky.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.879
Hm.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.479
We've got a plane ready and waiting
20 minutes away.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.559
The sooner we pool our resources,
the sooner we can end this thing.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.119
- All right, let's go. Everybody out.
- What about him?

15:26.240 --> 15:27.999
- We've got a very sick man here.
- Didn't you read the news?

15:28.120 --> 15:30.079
Nobody dies. There's a nurse
around here somewhere.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.559
You got two minutes.
Don't leave them alone.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.919
Jack, did we just join the CIA?

15:44.040 --> 15:46.039
I think we did.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.599
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.119
Take that fat-ass traitor to the airport
and put him in cargo.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.719
God help you.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.559
The families aren't kind
to people who let them down.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.359
- I did a lot of good.
- Oh, sure.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.319
All I'm gonna be remembered for...

16:09.440 --> 16:10.759
is this.

16:10.880 --> 16:14.399
But there were times
when I stopped them,

16:14.520 --> 16:16.159
when I said no to the families.

16:16.280 --> 16:19.119
There were so many times
that I said no.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.479
I wish I could say no now.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.199
What are you doing?

16:26.320 --> 16:27.799
It's all about the family in the end.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.239
They said that
they would get mine, unless...

16:30.360 --> 16:32.679
- No. No, no, no!
- No, please!

Some old man asking me directions

17:40.000 --> 17:41.959
and I just...

17:42.080 --> 17:44.279
looked right through you.

Did you see him?

17:53.120 --> 17:54.559
Did you see Ianto?

17:59.600 --> 18:01.199
You'd have liked him.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.599
Or maybe not.

I could travel this whole wide world...

24:05.520 --> 24:07.279
Problem is, I've looked.
There's no-one with these last names.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.319
REX: But there has to be.
They're names.

24:09.440 --> 24:10.999
I mean, they're names.
What names aren't names?

24:11.120 --> 24:12.999
These names.
According to every site I can think of,

24:13.120 --> 24:14.319
the names didn't just die out.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.839
They never existed.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.359
Could be done - it's happened before.

24:17.480 --> 24:18.639
At the end of the Second World War,

24:18.760 --> 24:20.519
all the Hitlers disappeared
from the Berlin phone book.

24:20.640 --> 24:23.919
Change your name, go back
and erase passport records,

24:24.040 --> 24:25.199
birth certificates.

24:25.320 --> 24:27.599
Do that for decades and you'd be buried
in the fabric of the world.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.479
There's gotta be a paper trail.

24:29.600 --> 24:31.079
Oh, I was born for this.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.159
All right, we've got Manhattan 1 928.

24:33.280 --> 24:36.559
Let's check...churches,
schools, Western Union.

24:36.680 --> 24:37.959
I'll get the full division on this.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.959
If these people bought or sold
orjoined anything,

24:40.080 --> 24:41.879
it's gotta be on paper somewhere.

24:42.000 --> 24:42.999
People always miss something.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.839
All right. Noah, sidebar.
I got something for you.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.119
ESTHER: Hey, remember
the Vivaldi inheritance in 2004?

24:48.240 --> 24:50.439
Follow that same pathway,
cos it worked in the end.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.759
And cross-reference it
with the word "Blessing".

24:52.880 --> 24:55.199
- Make "Blessing" a filter.
- Yep.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.799
Hey, um, I've gathered
some information for you.

24:58.920 --> 25:00.439
It's your sister.

25:00.560 --> 25:02.919
Is...is she all right?

25:03.040 --> 25:05.679
She's...OK.
She's under psych observation.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.599
- In the high security wing.
- Oh, my God.

25:08.720 --> 25:09.959
I went ahead and told them
you work for the government

25:10.080 --> 25:11.239
to get her some extra care, you know?

25:11.360 --> 25:13.759
Thank you.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.119
Thanks.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.919
Yeah, well, don't tell anyone.
Bad for my image.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.079
- All right, I'll send you the details.
- Are you making a personal call?

25:20.200 --> 25:21.919
No. Sorry, sir.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.319
Is that Mr Shapiro?

25:23.440 --> 25:25.439
You tell him, "Yes, it's personal.
Yes, it's important.

25:25.560 --> 25:26.799
"And yes, his wife called.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.759
"And I sent her flowers on his behalf."

25:28.880 --> 25:31.359
Charlotte Wills. Bane of my life.

25:31.480 --> 25:34.119
REX: Try hitting PhiCorp
with an official disclosure.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.439
Oh, yeah, and I got one more thing
for you - Oswald Danes.

25:36.560 --> 25:39.719
Yeah, we're eyeballing him now,
but not under close surveillance. Why?

25:39.840 --> 25:41.759
Harkness keeps watching him,
and his instincts are good.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.439
He says that if we're watching Danes

25:43.560 --> 25:44.959
then the three families
are watching him too.

25:45.080 --> 25:46.639
So, I want you to get
someone in there, OK?

25:46.760 --> 25:50.039
I'm on it right now. Er, it says here
that Oswald sold out Cowboy Stadium.

25:50.160 --> 25:52.919
- He's in Dallas.
- He's playing a stadium?

25:53.040 --> 25:56.239
He's preaching hellfire and salvation,
which makes Oswald Danes

25:56.360 --> 25:58.959
the most popular man in the world
right now.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.359
First, I'm trying to set up

26:02.480 --> 26:04.439
a joint appearance for you
with Madison Weakly.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.079
She's the bisected bride.

26:06.200 --> 26:10.239
You know, car accident sheared off
everything below the bikini line.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.319
Got married a week later
propped up on a box.

26:12.440 --> 26:15.719
Basically, she's made up of positive
thinking and colostomy bags.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.759
Um, anyway, they were thinking
you and she could share the spotlight

26:18.880 --> 26:21.159
if they could manage a two-shot,
obviously. (CLEARS THROAT)

26:21.280 --> 26:25.359
Next, I, er, I've got you these essays
by John Maynard Keynes.

26:25.480 --> 26:28.959
You've got interviews
about fixing the economy tomorrow.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.959
Mostly just call for more deregulation
and a resumption of burning.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.799
Now, we've got this.

- (MUSIC BLARES)
- It's a request

26:35.760 --> 26:37.999
from Washington to speak to
the Committee on Health and Immortality.

- # Santa Monica too... #
- Oswald?

- # ...Over to the valley... #
- It's Washington.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.799
So, what do you think? Yes, or no?

26:45.920 --> 26:47.239
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

26:47.360 --> 26:49.399
If you could turn that down...

26:49.520 --> 26:52.319
All right, I'm gonna need a reply
by Friday night

26:52.440 --> 26:53.799
or they'll ask someone else.

26:53.920 --> 26:57.119
I said, they'll ask someone else.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.519
Please, Oswald,

26:58.640 --> 27:00.919
I'm just trying to finish the day.
Could you turn the music down?

27:01.040 --> 27:02.119
(MUSIC STOPS)

27:02.240 --> 27:03.879
Get me a girl.

27:04.920 --> 27:06.039
How old?

27:07.440 --> 27:08.879
Legal age.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.079
Seriously?

27:11.200 --> 27:14.959
I've made a new life for myself,
a new chance

27:15.080 --> 27:17.559
with new...tastes.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.719
So, I want a woman.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.239

A redhead.

I'm sorry,
but you're Jilly Kitzinger, right?

27:42.480 --> 27:45.519
- I'm sorry. I don't have time...
- No, here, let me help you with this...

27:45.640 --> 27:47.239
All this stuff. I will take this.

27:47.360 --> 27:50.079
I will take that. That's better.

(DOOR LOCK CLUNKS)

27:57.880 --> 28:00.319
So, my name is Shawnie Yamaguchi,

28:00.440 --> 28:03.479
and I'm on that internship
from Harrigan Knights PR,

28:03.600 --> 28:05.839
and they said that
you are so busy and overworked

28:05.960 --> 28:08.559
and I figured, well, you know,
learn from the best.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.719
I don't need an intern. Thank you.

28:10.840 --> 28:13.839
I'm sure.
But...this isn't the latest model.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.279
And I can get you the prototype,

28:15.400 --> 28:17.559
if you want,
and you really need to get 4G.

28:17.680 --> 28:21.999
I got a contact in the store.
And that is an awful lot of reading.

28:22.120 --> 28:24.119
And I am free all night.

28:25.640 --> 28:26.999
Shawnie Yamaguchi?

28:27.120 --> 28:28.399
That is correct.

28:28.520 --> 28:30.719
Go get me a sandwich,

28:30.840 --> 28:32.799
tomato and Swiss

28:32.920 --> 28:34.119
on sourdough.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.119
Let's see how well you cope with that.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.319
And then you can find me a prostitute.

28:38.440 --> 28:39.519
I'm sorry?

28:39.640 --> 28:41.719
Start with the sandwich.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.439
Certainly.

28:43.560 --> 28:46.679
I don't mean to be rude,
but I don't know how you put up with him.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.079
Oh...

28:51.200 --> 28:53.839
I won't have to. Not for much longer.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.719
I'm sorry, what do you mean?

28:55.840 --> 28:56.999
Never mind. Off you go.

29:20.840 --> 29:24.079
Just give me till tomorrow
and I'll come see you, OK?

29:24.200 --> 29:26.679
Did you fix things?

29:26.800 --> 29:28.519
You said you were gonna fix them.

Not yet.

Still trying.

- Yeah.

She is, yeah.

Hey, when I get back,
we'll go to the promenade together,

29:43.720 --> 29:45.399
just you and me.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.839
Would you like that?

29:47.880 --> 29:49.039
I suppose.

29:49.160 --> 29:52.799
I know we keep talking about the miracle
like it's a bad thing,

29:52.920 --> 29:55.479
but we forget about the good side,

29:55.600 --> 29:57.839
all the years we're gonna have...

29:59.360 --> 30:01.439
...together. That's good, isn't it?

They said you reported me.

30:04.640 --> 30:05.999
Who said that?

30:06.120 --> 30:08.119
Is it true?

30:09.440 --> 30:10.679
I had to.

30:13.040 --> 30:14.239
For your own good.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.079
I know.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.719

from falling straight through the Earth

31:33.840 --> 31:35.759
Fine.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.919
Time out, I think, Drummond.

31:38.040 --> 31:40.479
No, sir. Not at all.

and fix this stinking world.

Thank you, sir.

I don't trust the phones these days.

31:51.840 --> 31:53.999
And we've got
these family people everywhere.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.359
And Jack's just as bad.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.399
Honestly, you should see him
right now, Rhys. He's sulking.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.839
Why? What's he doing now?

32:00.960 --> 32:03.359
Oh, don't tell me.
Did he get another bruise?

32:03.480 --> 32:05.919
- Who's that?
- Jack, her boss.

32:06.040 --> 32:08.119
Well, you tell her from me,

32:08.240 --> 32:10.159
I had a gun held to my head.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.759
My life was in danger,

32:12.880 --> 32:16.959
and her father's,
right inside our own house.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.279
And all because of her.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.159
So you tell her,

32:21.280 --> 32:22.959
don't give up.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.599
Go get the bastards,

32:26.720 --> 32:28.159
whatever it takes.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.399
Tell her yourself.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.519
No.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.119
I'm watching TV.

32:34.360 --> 32:38.279
- She says go get 'em.
- Yeah, I heard.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.839
So, what about Jack, then?

32:39.960 --> 32:43.159
Oh, he's doing that old thing,
keeping secrets. Won't tell me.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.159
Will you?

32:45.280 --> 32:46.359
Hmm?

32:46.480 --> 32:48.759
God knows what's going on.
What time is it there?

32:48.880 --> 32:50.319
Ah, it's almost eight.

32:50.440 --> 32:51.599
The telly's been on all night.

32:51.720 --> 32:52.639
They said there's gonna be

32:52.760 --> 32:54.919
a run on the banks.
Like a Lehman Brothers thing.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.119
- It's the pensions.
- Aye.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.839
The pension funds go bankrupt
because of the miracle

32:58.960 --> 33:00.199
and that starts off a domino effect

33:00.320 --> 33:02.479
cos everything's been on a knife-edge
since 2008.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.679
They said the best advice
is to invest in gold.

33:04.800 --> 33:06.159
There we are, we'll be fine.

33:06.280 --> 33:07.639

33:07.760 --> 33:09.519
Huh! How's Dad?

33:09.640 --> 33:11.439
(WHISPERS) She's asking how Dad is.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.079
Tell her the truth.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.039
Not so good, Gwen.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.679
Is he conscious?

33:16.800 --> 33:18.159
Not so much, no.

33:18.280 --> 33:21.879
The trouble is, we can't get a doctor in
cos they'll classify him Category 1 .

33:22.000 --> 33:23.239
And them ovens are still sitting there.

33:23.360 --> 33:24.719
They're only closed
cos of the protests.

33:24.840 --> 33:26.079
And they said on the news

33:26.200 --> 33:28.679
if we get a recession
then it's classic isolation policy.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.079
Given our lack of resources

33:30.200 --> 33:32.839
- the camps will open up again.
- Like someone planned it.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.799
Yeah. But does that include 2008
as well?

33:34.920 --> 33:36.359
I mean, you know,
was that part of the plan?

33:36.480 --> 33:38.839
- You know, a first stage?
- Could be.

33:38.960 --> 33:41.199
I think we've been manipulated
for decades.

33:41.320 --> 33:43.279
Yeah, but what for?

33:43.400 --> 33:46.039
- I mean, where's it all heading?
- I don't know.

33:46.160 --> 33:48.959
It's not like the old days with Torchwood.
I mean... (SIGHS)

33:49.080 --> 33:52.039
...we knew what we were fighting there.
But this,

33:52.160 --> 33:54.799
this is like the whole world is changing

33:54.920 --> 33:57.279
and we're just so tiny.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.159
God, I wish you'd come home.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.439
Not yet, sweetheart.

34:01.560 --> 34:03.439
But soon.

34:03.560 --> 34:04.679
Soon.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.719
(SOFTLY) OK.

34:13.680 --> 34:14.999
(FLOORBOARD SQUEAKS)

34:16.920 --> 34:19.599
- (TAPS FOOT)
- What are you doing?

34:21.400 --> 34:23.759
You seen this? Maybe it's the floor.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.279
What do you mean?

34:26.720 --> 34:29.199
Well, we're going through evidence
like Angelo's body did something.

34:29.320 --> 34:32.159
But the only strange thing
with this room is the floor. I...

34:32.280 --> 34:33.719
I knew something was bugging me.

34:33.840 --> 34:36.159
Look, the bed's on a sort of platform.

34:36.280 --> 34:37.919
Esther, don't. Just leave it.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.599
But look, it's not part
of the original design. It can't be.

34:40.720 --> 34:42.919
Esther, seriously. Listen to me.

34:43.040 --> 34:45.279
Don't say another word. Just leave it.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.479
Jack?

34:50.120 --> 34:51.679
It's the floor.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.479
Esther, stop, right now.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.519
(HE CHUCKLES)

34:57.640 --> 34:59.479
This is a hell of a lot better
than nicotine gum, let me tell you.

34:59.600 --> 35:01.239
You know what the rumour is
from Washington?

35:01.360 --> 35:04.119
If cancer cells are immortal,

35:04.240 --> 35:06.719
well then, the miracle switched them
around and made them plain mortal.

35:06.840 --> 35:10.039
They're keeping it quiet in case
there's an outbreak of spontaneous joy.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.399
I mean, we can't have that.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.199
But it means we've got
nothing to worry about.

35:13.320 --> 35:17.079
We can smoke our way into
the next Great Depression.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.159
Hm!

35:24.880 --> 35:25.879
Now...

35:27.720 --> 35:29.959
...does somebody want to tell me
what's going on between you three?

35:31.680 --> 35:32.959
Nothing.

35:43.160 --> 35:44.479
I'm sorry, Jack...

35:45.720 --> 35:48.199
...but we're trying to figure out
how Angelo Colasanto died.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.639
I think there's something
under the floor.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.199
OK, people, thank you very much.
Leave the room immediately.

36:09.320 --> 36:10.519
Good work.

36:11.880 --> 36:12.999
Wait for my call.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.959
Captain Harkness, what is that?

36:15.080 --> 36:16.439
No idea.

36:16.560 --> 36:17.959
Jack, tell us what it is,
cos if you could hear my sister

36:18.080 --> 36:20.239
volunteering to be categorised,
you would help.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.239
Look, if he says he doesn't know,
he doesn't know, OK?

36:22.360 --> 36:24.559
I've read the Torchwood file.
Are those materials extraterrestrial?

36:24.680 --> 36:27.719
I said he doesn't know.
Now, get out of his face.

36:27.840 --> 36:31.839
The file also says that Cooper
and Harkness inevitably form an alliance

36:31.960 --> 36:34.159
and the best results can be achieved
by separating them.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.839
OK, get her out of here.
And I mean it this time.

36:37.960 --> 36:40.959
Deport her. She's no longer welcome
in the United States.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.959
- Get her out of the country.
- Don't touch me.

36:43.080 --> 36:45.079
- Leave her alone.
- Oh, you have something to say?

36:45.200 --> 36:47.159
Please. No? Well,

36:47.280 --> 36:50.519
I'm sorry, Miss Cooper, but from
this moment on, Torchwood is defunct.

36:50.640 --> 36:53.599
You will be removed
from American soil immediately.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.519
And God help Great Britain.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.239
With me. Don't cause trouble.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.559
GWEN: Jack. I'll find you, all right?

36:58.680 --> 37:00.639
- I'll find you. I'll find you, Jack.
- Sir, you've got to reconsider this.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.679
- You can't do this.
- Then talk.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.439
By all means, start talking.

37:04.560 --> 37:07.679
The CIA doesn't have any authority
over me. You're not deporting me!

37:07.800 --> 37:09.839
I'm coming back!

37:09.960 --> 37:11.519
Still got nothing to say?

37:11.640 --> 37:12.919
Well, then, you're not gonna mind

37:13.040 --> 37:14.719
if we dig this thing up
and take it back for analysis.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.319
You can't.

37:16.440 --> 37:18.639
I'm sorry, OK? You can't touch it.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.119
Oh, he speaks at last.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.239
Jack, come on. What the hell is it?

37:22.360 --> 37:25.439
- Some sort of transmitter.
- OK, what does it do?

37:25.560 --> 37:27.639
Well, it mostly proves my theory

37:27.760 --> 37:30.359
that immortality is caused by
some kind of morphic field.

37:30.480 --> 37:33.599
Wait a minute.
You know what's causing the miracle?

37:33.720 --> 37:37.279
No, saying it's a morphic field is...
is as vague as saying it's radiation.

37:37.400 --> 37:40.559
I still don't know how,
where or what is creating it.

37:40.680 --> 37:44.079
So, it transmits, what, some sort of field
that cancels out the first one

37:44.200 --> 37:45.239
so Angelo could die?

37:45.360 --> 37:47.079
- And where did he get it?
- I don't know everything.

37:47.200 --> 37:48.279
How big is this field?

37:48.400 --> 37:49.799
- The whole house?
- Smaller.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.839
About the size of that panel.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.759
So, we would be able to
stop the miracle

37:53.880 --> 37:56.679
if we could create a field
as big as, what, the whole planet?

37:56.800 --> 38:00.199
No, you need a structure like this panel
as big as the whole planet.

38:00.320 --> 38:02.879
Well, I'm sure we'll be able
to replicate its effects.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.279
Don't touch it, seriously.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.279
That's a proper null field.
You change the dynamic

38:06.400 --> 38:09.639
and it could nullify everything,
even life.

38:09.760 --> 38:12.319
- Well, then, you need to make it safe.
- I am not an expert.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.959
You're the closest thing we've got.
Now, make it safe.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.999
And then we're gonna take this thing
back to Langley.

38:23.040 --> 38:25.039
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

38:35.200 --> 38:37.439
Mr Danes.

38:37.560 --> 38:41.479
My name's Claire.
Or whatever you want it to be.

38:41.600 --> 38:45.639
Now, I did have to adopt a dress code
in order to get through hotel security.

38:45.760 --> 38:49.639
You know how that is. But I have
clothes in my bag if you'd like.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.479
Schoolgirl outfit, maybe?

38:51.600 --> 38:53.159
There won't be any need for that.

38:53.280 --> 38:56.039
OK. Well, it's not about
the clothes, anyway.

38:56.160 --> 38:59.959
(GIGGLES)
I can act all kinds of innocent.

39:00.080 --> 39:01.279
Whatever you want.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.439
I was very clear I don't want that.
Not at all.

39:04.560 --> 39:06.679
What do you want?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.559
I suppose...

39:09.680 --> 39:11.439
we could talk a little.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.199
- Would you like a drink?
- And then what?

39:14.320 --> 39:16.719
I need to know exactly
what we're doing tonight.

39:17.880 --> 39:20.239
Maybe we could have dinner...

39:20.360 --> 39:22.639
on room service.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.279
I'm sorry, you mean like a date?

39:25.400 --> 39:27.559
- (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
- (GIGGLES)

39:28.600 --> 39:29.959
If you want.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.919
Mr Danes, I do know who you are.

39:34.040 --> 39:36.279
I mean, from your trial.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.719
Except that's not everything that I am.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.079
Don't presume to know me.
I am capable of

39:42.200 --> 39:44.359
much more than my reputation.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.199
So, you wanna date me?

39:47.720 --> 39:49.319
To begin with.

39:50.400 --> 39:51.519
Oh, my God.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.399
So, would that be, like,

39:53.520 --> 39:55.519
your first date ever?

39:55.640 --> 39:57.079
(GIGGLES)

39:58.160 --> 40:00.639
I said don't presume.

40:02.120 --> 40:03.599
We could have a drink.

40:03.720 --> 40:06.199
Maybe a fine wine,

40:06.320 --> 40:07.839
civilised people...

40:07.960 --> 40:09.439
adult company.

40:09.560 --> 40:11.199
Actually...no.

40:11.320 --> 40:13.799
If you don't mind,
I think I'd like to go.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.439
But I do mind. I'm paying.

40:16.560 --> 40:18.679
Mr Danes, the thing is,
I could cope with this

40:18.800 --> 40:21.199
if it meant shoving my face
in the dirt - I'm used to that.

40:21.320 --> 40:26.039
But if you want us to pretend
that you're normal,

40:26.160 --> 40:27.319
no way. No.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.359
- No. No, look...
- Please don't...

40:29.480 --> 40:31.679
- Please don't do that.
- All I'm asking for is your company.

40:31.800 --> 40:33.279
That's all. Just your company.

40:33.400 --> 40:36.479
Well, I think I should warn you
that girls my age fight back.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.279
You know that already, though,
don't you, and that's why

40:39.400 --> 40:40.959
- you prefer kids in the first...
- Stop!

40:41.080 --> 40:42.599
Don't you dare!

40:48.440 --> 40:51.399
If you want to be a changed man,
you're running out of time.

40:51.520 --> 40:53.479
The way I heard it,

40:53.600 --> 40:55.799
you've been classified a Category 0.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.759
What's Category 0?

40:59.880 --> 41:02.319
Oh, that day is gonna come.

41:03.720 --> 41:05.639
Category 0 is you.

41:12.960 --> 41:14.959
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

41:24.360 --> 41:27.199
- What's Category 0?
- What's...?

41:27.320 --> 41:28.879
What? Um...

41:29.000 --> 41:30.559
What's Category 0,

41:30.680 --> 41:31.919
and why does my whore
know about it?

41:32.040 --> 41:32.959
Uh..

41:33.080 --> 41:34.839
Clever girl.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.879
That's what you get for employing
someone who sleeps with senators.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.559
- She's been listening.
- Tell me,

41:39.680 --> 41:41.599
- what's Category 0?
- Look, Oswald,

41:41.720 --> 41:45.039
did you really think it would never
come to an end, your freedom?

41:45.160 --> 41:47.999
There's an emergency mandate
being passed through Congress

41:48.120 --> 41:49.959
defining a new Category 0,

41:50.080 --> 41:51.599
meaning people who have...

41:51.720 --> 41:54.919
earned themselves a place
in the ovens for moral reasons.

41:55.040 --> 41:56.079
They want to burn me alive?

41:56.200 --> 41:57.519
Oswald, you were always
sentenced to death.

41:57.640 --> 42:00.399
What you had was a wonderful delay.

42:00.520 --> 42:03.199
And now it's time for that adventure
to come to an end.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.759
But...

42:06.760 --> 42:08.039
...people love me.

42:08.160 --> 42:10.599
Television loves you.

42:10.720 --> 42:12.199
It's a different thing.

42:12.320 --> 42:13.719
They can't kill me.

42:13.840 --> 42:16.279
- Not yet. I haven't found them.
- Haven't found who?

42:16.400 --> 42:17.599
How long have you known about this?

42:17.720 --> 42:20.039
- How long have you known?
- I...

42:20.160 --> 42:21.399
How long have you known about this?

42:21.520 --> 42:22.479
Oswald...

42:25.920 --> 42:28.239
(SCREAMS)

42:34.880 --> 42:36.239
I'll have you arrested for this!

42:40.720 --> 42:43.559
They're gonna reopen those ovens
and you're going in!

42:43.680 --> 42:45.919
You run, Oswald!

42:46.040 --> 42:48.199
Run as fast as you can!

42:48.320 --> 42:50.359
You've got the most famous face
on the planet.

42:50.480 --> 42:52.639
Where are you gonna hide?!

42:52.760 --> 42:55.559
Where are you gonna go, Oswald?
What are you gonna do?

42:57.280 --> 42:58.679
(BEEPING)

43:01.480 --> 43:03.399
Esther,
can you come here for a second?

43:04.760 --> 43:06.159
Er, and Rex.

43:07.400 --> 43:09.839
I need you to hold
these pattern blocks in place.

43:10.840 --> 43:13.359
- All right, which ones?
- There.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.639
- Put your hands on the panel.
- Jack,

43:15.760 --> 43:17.679
I'm really sorry about this,
but I didn't know.

43:17.800 --> 43:20.519
Yeah, now, listen to me quickly.
I've broadened the transmission

43:20.640 --> 43:22.599
so it's nullifying sound waves.

43:22.720 --> 43:26.279
No-one outside the field can hear us.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.479
So, make yourself look busy,

43:28.600 --> 43:32.879
just stay where you are
and no-one can hear what we're saying.

43:33.000 --> 43:35.479
What are you talking about?
They're right there.

43:35.600 --> 43:38.159
Hey, you can hear me, right? Hey!

43:38.280 --> 43:40.319
Would you turn around
and not look at him?

43:40.440 --> 43:41.919
They can't hear us?

43:42.040 --> 43:43.519
It's a null field.

43:43.640 --> 43:46.079
No. No way.

43:46.200 --> 43:48.119
Rex, don't attract attention.

43:48.240 --> 43:51.719
All right. Esther,
I want you to count to 1 00 out loud.

43:51.840 --> 43:53.559
All right? Just keep counting.

43:53.680 --> 43:55.719
Go ahead, go.

43:55.840 --> 43:57.119
One,

43:57.240 --> 43:58.599
two, three,

43:58.720 --> 44:00.239
four, five,

44:00.360 --> 44:01.879
six, seven...

44:02.000 --> 44:03.599
(VOICE MUTED)

44:07.200 --> 44:09.239
Excuse me. Sorry about that.

44:09.360 --> 44:11.039
Just check that medical record, OK?

44:13.200 --> 44:16.799
- ..30, 3 1 , 32...
- Holy shit. This is insane.

44:16.920 --> 44:18.159
They can still see us.

44:18.280 --> 44:20.719
Keep your heads down, facing away,
like you're concentrating, OK?

44:20.840 --> 44:22.279
This thing's real.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.439
How does it work?

44:25.560 --> 44:28.159
I can't tell you. That's the point.
Just listen to me.

44:28.280 --> 44:31.519
I knew this stuff the second I saw it.
Yes, it's alien technology.

44:31.640 --> 44:33.519
The only examples of it on Earth

44:33.640 --> 44:36.199
were in the Torchwood Hub.

44:36.320 --> 44:38.759
They were buried in the ruins.

44:38.880 --> 44:40.639
But Angelo had people watching.

44:40.760 --> 44:43.279
He must have salvaged it,
knowing the miracle was coming.

44:43.400 --> 44:45.719
So what did he do?
Trigger it with your DNA or something?

44:45.840 --> 44:48.239
Maybe that was revenge,
or maybe giving me a clue.

44:48.360 --> 44:52.439
But there's only one
course of action left now.

44:52.560 --> 44:54.399
You have to get me out of here.

44:54.520 --> 44:57.559
- Are you crazy?
- Turn your head!

44:57.680 --> 45:02.079
Jack, listen to me. The CIA is not
the enemy. That's why I brought them in.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.639
Don't you understand? You don't...

45:03.760 --> 45:06.439
(MUTTERS) Here we go.

45:06.560 --> 45:07.919
Be calm...

45:08.040 --> 45:09.439
See...

45:09.560 --> 45:13.879
Look, you don't need to run any more, OK?
We can protect you.

45:14.000 --> 45:15.879
There's a reason
why Torchwood was secret.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.799
We kept things hidden
from the human race.

45:17.920 --> 45:22.479
This technology is a science
the world should never know.

45:22.600 --> 45:25.039
How can you know that?

45:25.160 --> 45:29.199
I know, Esther,
because I've seen the future.

45:31.120 --> 45:33.359
I've walked the future world
and breathed its air.

45:36.640 --> 45:39.959
And this technology
would send it to damnation.

45:40.080 --> 45:43.679
Just imagine
the stealth technology of a null field

45:43.800 --> 45:45.719
hiding bombs, hiding planes,

45:45.840 --> 45:50.439
shielding one side from radiation
while the other side burns.

45:50.560 --> 45:52.479
This thing would be the end of us.

45:52.600 --> 45:55.359
This timeline would be terminal.

45:57.680 --> 45:58.799
He's right.

45:58.920 --> 46:01.399
(SCOFFS) Whose side are you on?

46:01.520 --> 46:03.399
Even if the government...

46:05.360 --> 46:06.919
Even if the government
had this one panel

46:07.040 --> 46:09.999
and they put people inside and they died,
it's the same thing as the ovens.

46:10.120 --> 46:13.719
It's control over life and death
and we've seen that that doesn't work.

46:13.840 --> 46:17.119
But you trust me, don't you?
Both of you?

46:17.240 --> 46:19.159
After all we've done?

46:19.280 --> 46:22.079
Please, I'm begging you,
get me out of here.

46:22.200 --> 46:24.359
Look, this is the alpha plate.

46:24.480 --> 46:26.479
Without it,
this is just a bunch of metal.

46:26.600 --> 46:29.119
You've gotta get me and the plate
away from this house.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.919
Jack, listen to me.
We can't, OK? We are the CIA

46:34.040 --> 46:36.279
and this is a genuine CIA operation.

46:36.400 --> 46:38.879
This is history, Rex.
This is everything.

46:39.000 --> 46:41.439
Please, get me out.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.079
(MUTED SPEECH)

46:59.880 --> 47:02.319
- I think you should call the police.
- This is bigger than the police.

47:02.440 --> 47:03.759
I'm organising a press conference.

47:03.880 --> 47:05.559
I'm gonna say
that Oswald Danes is on the run

47:05.680 --> 47:07.039
- with all his old appetites.
- (LIFT BELL DINGS)

47:07.160 --> 47:09.039
It's gonna be the biggest witch hunt
this country's ever seen.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.199
Oh...

47:10.320 --> 47:11.799
Um...

47:11.920 --> 47:15.439
Shawnie, can you give us a second?
This is a friend of mine...

47:15.560 --> 47:17.079
I think.

47:20.160 --> 47:22.519
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to warn you.

47:22.640 --> 47:25.039
You're being watched
by a CIA field agent.

47:25.160 --> 47:26.719
Me?

47:26.840 --> 47:28.079
Don't be ridiculous.

47:34.440 --> 47:35.999
(GUNSHOT)

47:38.880 --> 47:42.279
And secondly, you're being considered
for a promotion.

47:42.400 --> 47:45.199
- You just shot her.
- Does a promotion sound interesting?

47:45.320 --> 47:47.919
- She was CIA?
- I need you to focus, Miss Kitzinger.

47:48.040 --> 47:51.039
- How would you react to a promotion?
- With PhiCorp?

47:51.160 --> 47:52.839
Oh, we're way above PhiCorp.

47:52.960 --> 47:54.239
Then who are you?

47:54.360 --> 47:56.599
We're a family business.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.439
Interested?

48:00.120 --> 48:02.759
Yes.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.759
Well, then,
that completes the interview.

48:06.160 --> 48:07.839
- And we'd better leave.
- Where are we going?

48:07.960 --> 48:09.439
A long way away.

48:09.560 --> 48:10.999
I have her.

48:11.120 --> 48:12.359
She's with us now.

48:12.480 --> 48:14.799
Thanks. Good news.

48:14.920 --> 48:19.239
Catholic churches love records.
There's tons of this stuff.

48:19.360 --> 48:21.199
Sorry, am I interrupting?

48:21.320 --> 48:23.439
Oh, no, it was just a family thing,
that's all.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.039
All right, let's get started.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.839
The whole world's depending on us.

48:32.320 --> 48:33.479
REX: Hey, Jack,

48:33.600 --> 48:35.599
Shapiro wants to see you.

48:35.720 --> 48:36.959
Yeah.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.199
Wait a minute.
You might want to grab your coat.

48:39.320 --> 48:41.639
- He's outside by the forensics vehicle.
- Thanks.

48:45.920 --> 48:48.439
- JACK: Thank you.
- Yeah, just shut up.

48:48.560 --> 48:51.359
Now listen, this is the story.

48:51.480 --> 48:54.439
Jack knocked him out, held us
at gunpoint and stole a car, OK?

48:54.560 --> 48:55.919
- All right, come on.
- OK.

48:56.040 --> 48:57.479
You're not coming with me?

48:57.600 --> 48:59.679
We can't. That's why we've gotta
keep our faces out of this.

48:59.800 --> 49:02.319
I'm sorry, Jack. But the CIA has a chance
of solving this thing now.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.919
And they need me and Esther -
we can help.

49:04.040 --> 49:05.439
There's a courtyard this way.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.759
All right, now listen.
There's gonna be a guard on the gate.

49:08.880 --> 49:12.039
I'll tell him Shapiro authorised a car.
Just keep your head down.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.679
- Go, go, go!
- Which one is it?

49:13.800 --> 49:15.119
I don't know. They're all the same.
Just chirp the thing.

49:15.240 --> 49:16.159
(BEEPING)

49:16.280 --> 49:17.559
- MAN: Hey, stop! I said stop.
- Go! Just go.

49:17.680 --> 49:18.879
(GUNSHOT)

49:19.000 --> 49:20.479
Jack!

49:23.560 --> 49:25.279
Stay where you are!

49:25.400 --> 49:27.799
He saw me. Rex, he saw me.

49:27.920 --> 49:29.439
- Come on, Jack.
- He saw me. Rex, he saw me.

49:29.560 --> 49:32.239
REX: I know. You can't stay.
You definitely cannot stay.

49:32.360 --> 49:34.999
Someone's gonna have to go with him.
Jack, that's right, get in there.

49:35.120 --> 49:36.479
Come with us.

49:36.600 --> 49:39.239
- I can't. Look after him, Esther.
- My sister.

49:39.360 --> 49:41.119
I know, but someone will have heard
that shot. Now go.

49:41.240 --> 49:42.559
Rex, you've got blood!

49:42.680 --> 49:45.399
It's my heart, OK? Just go.
It's my heart. Go! Go!

49:45.520 --> 49:47.199
(TYRES SCREECH)

49:57.600 --> 50:00.399
RADIO: It's morning in America,
it's morning across the Western world,

50:00.520 --> 50:02.359
and the banks are closing down.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.359
It's a disaster
of almost biblical proportions.

50:04.480 --> 50:05.759
Jack, you still with me?

50:05.880 --> 50:07.559
Some say the concept of money
itself is under threat.

50:07.680 --> 50:09.279
- The euro has exacerbated...
- Jack?

50:09.400 --> 50:11.119
- ...the financial crisis...
- Can you hear me?

50:11.240 --> 50:13.399
...encouraging some countries
to behave as recklessly

50:13.520 --> 50:15.359
as the banks themselves...

50:31.920 --> 50:35.799
Oh, my God...
I don't...I don't know where to go.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.919
Jack, please. Please say something.

50:38.040 --> 50:40.799
Oh, my God, I don't know what to do!

50:41.840 --> 50:43.119
Jack...

50:45.240 --> 50:46.879
Oh, my God.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.639
I don't know what to do.

50:53.280 --> 50:55.599
I have reason to suspect
you may be illegally harbouring

50:55.720 --> 50:58.919
an unsupported Category 1
deceased person.

50:59.040 --> 51:00.639
You've been invited to Shanghai.

51:00.760 --> 51:02.999
The families want to meet you...

51:03.120 --> 51:04.279
in person.

51:04.400 --> 51:07.319
I'm ratherjealous.
They're taking you to the Blessing.

51:08.800 --> 51:10.639
(HE GROANS SOFTLY)

51:16.240 --> 51:17.319
(CREAKING)

51:33.920 --> 51:36.839
You're scared.
Your skin's a little too tight.

51:36.960 --> 51:38.519
There's something
just out of the corner of your eye

51:38.640 --> 51:41.519
you can't quite see. Hmm?
