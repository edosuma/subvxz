00:05.273 --> 00:07.208
(Birds chirping)

00:07.241 --> 00:09.210
(Cicada buzz)

00:13.547 --> 00:14.815
(Footsteps thud)

00:14.848 --> 00:16.417
(Blinds rasp open)
- Ah!

00:16.450 --> 00:19.753
- Ha, now that is what I call
a beautiful morning!

00:19.787 --> 00:22.556
Looks like another
full house tonight.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.758
Things are starting
to look up, sweetheart.

00:24.792 --> 00:27.228
Big waves! Big waves!
(Knock on door)

00:27.261 --> 00:29.430
- Oh yes.
Yes, tidal waves of prosperity

00:29.463 --> 00:31.532
are crashing down,
all around us.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.034
- Soon enough. You just wait.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.704
(Door opens)

00:36.737 --> 00:38.672
Hey partner,
what's the good word?

00:38.706 --> 00:41.142
- There's a dead guy in Room 4.

00:41.175 --> 00:44.545
- What? Whadda ya mean
there's a dead guy in...

00:44.578 --> 00:46.714
come in, come in.

00:46.747 --> 00:49.250
Moira: Did I hear
what I think I heard?

00:49.283 --> 00:51.519
Has someone been killed?
Stevie: No.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.587
- No! No, John, no. No!

00:53.621 --> 00:56.557
I have endured a cornucopia
of trauma that last few years,

00:56.590 --> 00:59.793
I draw the line at living
in a crime scene.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.829
- Okay, nobody's been murdered,
Mrs. Rose.

01:01.862 --> 01:04.165
I went in to clean Room 4,

01:04.198 --> 01:06.467
and this old guy was like,
asleep in his bed.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.470
But like, forever asleep.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.673
(Sighs) Like, checked out
without paying, asleep.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.709
- Okay, I think it's a little
early for humour, Stevie.

01:15.743 --> 01:18.479
- Oh, I'm sorry, did you just
see a dead body?

01:18.512 --> 01:20.814
- What did this gentleman
look like?

01:20.848 --> 01:23.851
- I don't know, like old.
- John old? Or old, old?

01:23.884 --> 01:26.187
- Well, I don't quite see
the relevance

01:26.220 --> 01:27.855
in that question, Moira,
the man is dead.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.723
I mean we can't have
the other guests finding out

01:29.757 --> 01:31.892
about a dead body
in one of the rooms.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.827
- Ugh!
- Ew! There's a dead body

01:33.861 --> 01:35.696
in one of the rooms?
- Okay, I always knew

01:35.729 --> 01:37.531
there'd be a murder here
eventually.

01:37.565 --> 01:39.200
I'm gonna go pack up my things,
I assume we're moving?

01:39.233 --> 01:40.701
- We're not packing up
our things,

01:40.734 --> 01:43.204
and everybody just calm down.
Nobody's been murdered.

01:43.237 --> 01:46.674
- Okay, the old man in Room 4
died alone in his sleep.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.709
- Why do I find that scenario
even more bone-chilling

01:48.742 --> 01:50.511
than murder?

01:50.544 --> 01:53.314
- Stevie, do we know how this
man expired?

01:53.347 --> 01:55.549
- Do I look like a coroner?

01:55.583 --> 01:58.619
- I don't think you want people
answering that question.

01:58.652 --> 02:03.757
- It feels like every time the
motel sells out, someone dies.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.327
- Uh, we've only sold out
one night.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.462
- Exactly.

02:11.665 --> 02:16.170
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

02:17.805 --> 02:20.174
- So you and Patrick are
sitting in his car last night,

02:20.208 --> 02:21.809
and you just leaned in
and kissed him?

02:23.477 --> 02:25.646
- Okay, what part of this
conversation

02:25.679 --> 02:28.182
don't you understand?
- Okay, and he wanted that.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.350
- Yes.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.453
- Like he told you
that he wanted that.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.188
- Fall off a bridge, please.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.224
- You gave me such a hard time
for getting involved with Ted,

02:36.257 --> 02:38.692
and then you just French
your business partner

02:38.726 --> 02:41.495
literally the second he peeks
his head out of the closet.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.198
- I'll have you know this is
the healthiest first day

02:44.232 --> 02:46.467
of a relationship
I've ever had.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.502
- Well, all I know
is that Patrick is

02:48.536 --> 02:50.438
a sweet little button face,
David,

02:50.471 --> 02:52.340
so don't mess this up.

02:52.373 --> 02:53.674
(Door opens)
Johnny: Oh good,

02:53.707 --> 02:55.409
I'm glad you're both
still here.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.644
We're gonna need your room
for the night,

02:56.677 --> 02:58.879
so uh, pack up.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.215
- Um, no.
- Absolutely not.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.750
Johnny: The motel is sold out

03:02.783 --> 03:05.453
and we're unable to remove
a body, and disinfect Room 4,

03:05.486 --> 03:07.221
in time for check-in.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.857
- Okay, every inch of that
sentence made me sick.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.926
Moira: I agree with David,
we must all move on from this.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.562
- Did I say that?

03:14.595 --> 03:16.230
- Well there's no use wasting
time

03:16.264 --> 03:17.398
worrying about what happened?

03:17.431 --> 03:19.267
Johnny: We're not worrying
about what happened, Moira,

03:19.300 --> 03:20.668
we're trying to find
a solution,

03:20.701 --> 03:22.736
and I'm gonna need the family
to help us through this.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.672
- Okay, why don't the new
guests stay in your room?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.974
- It'll take day just to re-box
your mother's wigs.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.977
- Oh my God, can you imagine?
Not one of you is trained.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.779
- Okay, bottom line,
we need the room,

03:31.812 --> 03:33.447
so throw some things in a bag

03:33.481 --> 03:35.449
and we're gonna set you up
in our room.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.985
- Okay, I've never just thrown
some things in a bag before,

03:38.018 --> 03:39.787
so you might have to give me
a minute.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.889
- Yeah, and I'm gonna be
sleeping somewhere else.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.591
- Same.
- Like literally anywhere else.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.793
- Yeah, like an old tent
by the side of the highway.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.728
- Okay, enough,
let's get going, please?

03:47.761 --> 03:49.763
- Yes, yes, plenty of work
to be done.

03:49.797 --> 03:52.366
Unfortunately my previous
engagements preclude me

03:52.400 --> 03:54.768
from offering my beneficence
around the motel today.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.305
John, I hate to leave you
like this!

03:57.338 --> 03:59.873
- Yeah, I know, Moira,
you know, busy busy.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.942
I want the room cleaned up
in an hour.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.043
- Okay.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.513
- Um, I'm gonna need a roll
of dry-cleaning bags,

04:05.546 --> 04:07.381
and some padlocks.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.620
(Door opens and closes)

04:12.653 --> 04:16.056
- Okay, so Roland knows a guy
at the coroner's office.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.393
- Wait, you told Roland?
- Yes.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.695
I don't know, I-I ran into him,

04:23.397 --> 04:24.698
and he asked me how I was.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.434
- Well, that's not good,
Stevie.

04:26.467 --> 04:27.901
- No, I might have panicked.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.870
- I wouldn't trust Roland
with a set of chopsticks,

04:29.903 --> 04:32.039
let alone a dead body!
- Yeah.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.707
- Oh, hello!
- Hello.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.443
- Checking out?

04:35.476 --> 04:37.578
Roland: Hello, Johnny. Stevie.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.880
I come bearing good news.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.682
- Okay, Roland, as you can see,

04:41.715 --> 04:43.317
Mr. Rose is checking out
a guest right now,

04:43.351 --> 04:45.386
so maybe you can hold off
on that good news?

04:45.419 --> 04:47.455
- Oh sure, I got it.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.757
Uh, well let me just say this,

04:49.790 --> 04:52.460
re the toilet
that died in Room 4,

04:55.529 --> 04:58.999
the plumber will be here
in a few hours.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.335
He said he'd be here sooner,
but he has another autopsy.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.373
- Toilet on the fritz.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.644
(Door opens and closes)

05:11.979 --> 05:13.881
- Okay, so, what'd the coroner
say?

05:13.914 --> 05:16.550
- My guys will be here between
4 and 5.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.118
- Well, that's not good,

05:18.151 --> 05:20.388
we can't have the guests
watching a dead body

05:20.421 --> 05:21.889
being dragged out of here.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.657
- So probably best to keep your
guests in their rooms.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.793
- And, how're we gonna
do that?

05:25.826 --> 05:28.128
- Do the rooms lock from
the outside?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.798
- We're not locking the guests
in their rooms, Roland.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.966
- Well, I'm sure they'll be
fine, Johnny.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.604
I saw a lot of dead bodies
when I was a kid,

05:36.637 --> 05:40.541
(German accent) und I would say
that I turned out pretty okay.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.678
(Door opens and closes)

05:44.712 --> 05:46.013
- Hmm.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.851
(Dog barking)

05:52.620 --> 05:53.987
Ted: Thank you very much.
Man: Bye.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.424
- Alexis!
- Oh my God, Ted, hey!

05:56.457 --> 05:58.792
Um, was there like a pet
massacre, or something?

05:58.826 --> 06:00.761
What is with all these sad
looking people?

06:00.794 --> 06:03.163
- Uh, nope, all these perfectly
happy-looking people

06:03.196 --> 06:05.466
are actually applying
for your old job.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.635
- I literally just quit, Ted.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.070
- Again, quit implies
a negative connotation

06:10.103 --> 06:12.773
and I'd say that we had a pretty
fun time working together.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.108
- We did have a pretty fun
time. (Laughs)

06:15.142 --> 06:17.745
- That's not what I meant,
but anyway, what's up?

06:17.778 --> 06:19.947
- Oh, I just wanted
to thank you again

06:19.980 --> 06:21.749
for coming to my graduation
yesterday.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.817
It was a very sweet surprise.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.453
- Oh, it was my pleasure.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.787
Man: Here.
- Oh, thanks.

06:28.789 --> 06:31.124
- And, I also had a question.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.093
- Uh yeah, Alexis, I'd love
to answer that question,

06:33.126 --> 06:34.695
it's just I'm kind of right
in the middle

06:34.728 --> 06:36.497
of interviewing these people,
so.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.500
- Okay, yeah, totally.
I will just um...

06:43.604 --> 06:46.674
um...
I actually used to work here.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.942
This used to be my desk, so.

06:50.177 --> 06:52.145
- You know, now that you're
here,

06:52.179 --> 06:54.014
I guess you could sit in on
the interviews with me.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.649
- Oh. Okay, sure.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.688
Now, everybody,
just so you know,

07:00.721 --> 07:02.590
I got a job here,

07:02.623 --> 07:05.225
and I have literally zero
interest in animals,

07:05.258 --> 07:07.695
so you guys are already like,
way ahead.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.897
- Okay.
- So... (claps)

07:09.930 --> 07:11.632
Have fun!

07:16.670 --> 07:17.905
(Birds chirping)

07:22.610 --> 07:23.977
(Bell on door chimes)

07:28.982 --> 07:30.918
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.723
(Footsteps thud,
floorboards creak)

07:38.158 --> 07:39.760
(Laughs)

07:40.928 --> 07:42.930
(Clears throat)

07:44.698 --> 07:46.099
- So, someone's been busy.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.101
- Oh yeah, yeah,
I've been up since 5.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.771
Could not sleep,
been thinking about...

07:50.804 --> 07:53.140
stuff, you know, last night.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.810
- Regrets?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.946
- What? No, why would I have
regrets?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.248
- I don't know, I think it's a,
just a habit to ask.

08:01.281 --> 08:03.551
- No, no, no, no. No regrets.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.853
No, I feel good.
I feel like a...

08:05.886 --> 08:08.155
weight's been sorta lifted off
my shoulders.

08:08.188 --> 08:11.892
It's all very new, you know,
and it's a lot to process but...

08:11.925 --> 08:14.094
- Well, here's something fun.

08:14.127 --> 08:17.197
Um... what if I stayed
at your place tonight?

08:19.032 --> 08:20.634
- Huh.

08:22.069 --> 08:25.639
- It's just that there's some
things happening at the motel,
and I...

08:25.673 --> 08:28.709
- Yeah, uh, sorry David,
maybe I haven't been clear,

08:28.742 --> 08:30.678
I'm gonna need to take this
a lot slower

08:30.711 --> 08:32.212
than a sleepover tonight.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.214
- Oh okay, not like a sleepover
sleepover.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.916
- I think it's important that
I be honest with you

08:35.949 --> 08:37.785
about how I'm feeling,

08:37.818 --> 08:39.587
because I know you have a lot
of experience in this area,

08:39.620 --> 08:41.589
but for me--
- Oh my God, no,

08:41.622 --> 08:45.325
I mean yes, I do, but that's
not what I'm implying. That's--

08:45.358 --> 08:47.728
Moira: Ding-a-ding.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.630
- Patrick: Oh hey, Mrs. Rose.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.632
Um, just takin' this
to the back.

08:51.665 --> 08:52.900
We'll talk about this later.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.202
- Okay, yeah, it's just some
crossed wires.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.904
May I help you?

08:56.937 --> 08:59.640
- It's startlingly quiet
in here, David.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.208
Is that a good sign?

09:01.241 --> 09:03.711
I thought you were booked up
all day,

09:03.744 --> 09:05.679
and that's why you couldn't
help Dad with the dead b-

09:05.713 --> 09:08.716
that thing in the motel.
- I am booked up, David.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.217
You should see my schedule.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.153
I'm positively bedeviled
with meetings, etc.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.988
- What are you doing here?

09:15.022 --> 09:17.825
- You know what I'd love?
A tea.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.693
- We don't sell tea.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.863
- Um, you know, I was gonna go
make a run to the cafe,

09:22.896 --> 09:24.164
I could get you a tea
if you want.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.966
- No, that's not necessary.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.868
- How serendipitous.
Thank you, Peter.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.337
- It's Patrick.
- Anything else?

09:30.370 --> 09:32.873
- Nothing else for me,
thank you, just the scone.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.709
- You mean the tea?
- Why not. Thank you.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.347
(Bell on door chimes,
door opens and closes)

09:40.380 --> 09:42.850
Okay, I was in the middle

09:42.883 --> 09:44.017
of like a pretty important
conversation,

09:44.051 --> 09:46.353
with my business partner, so...

09:47.821 --> 09:50.724
- Sorry David, I had nowhere
else to turn.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.193
It's probably nothing,
but I think I've killed a man.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.001
I don't know what to do, David.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.136
The last time I felt this
emotionally encumbered,

10:03.170 --> 10:06.206
I was playing Lady Macbeth
on a Crystal Skies cruise ship

10:06.239 --> 10:08.275
during Shakespeare at Sea Week.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.977
- Okay, well I don't know
what to do either,

10:10.010 --> 10:12.045
because you still haven't told
me what exactly happened.

10:12.079 --> 10:15.182
(Bell on door chimes,
door opens and closes)

10:15.215 --> 10:16.784
- One tea for you.

10:18.251 --> 10:21.755
One caramel macchiato skim,
2 sweeteners,

10:21.789 --> 10:23.423
and a sprinkle of cocoa powder
for you.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.392
- Thank you.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.127
- You're very speedy.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.396
- Thanks. I wasn't sure
about the scone,

10:29.429 --> 10:31.999
so I got one just to be safe.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.801
- There's nothing wrong with
treating yourself, dear.

10:36.169 --> 10:39.072
- Okay.

10:39.106 --> 10:42.142
- Okay, I am pretty sure
that he's ready to quit on me,

10:42.175 --> 10:43.977
so can you please...
- Very well.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.846
How to get started.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.915
Um, I woke up yesterday morning
with a spring in my step.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.216
- Start later, please.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.751
- I could never know
where the day was--

10:50.784 --> 10:52.319
- Fast forward it.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.788
- I ran into the elderly
gentleman outside his room

10:54.822 --> 10:56.824
and he asked me
for a painkiller.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.793
- And?
- I told him I didn't have one.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.395
- Okay.
- But I did have one.

11:02.429 --> 11:05.699
In fact I had several sample
packets in my purse.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.234
I had come from the pharmacy,

11:07.267 --> 11:08.301
and they were just out
in a bowl.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.971
But I refused the man,
and the next thing I know,

11:11.004 --> 11:12.940
he turns up dead!

11:12.973 --> 11:15.175
- Well, why didn't you just
give him the pill?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.844
- Because David,

11:16.877 --> 11:18.779
because I can barely come
to terms with the fact

11:18.812 --> 11:21.381
that I've resorted to
hoarding... sample packets

11:21.414 --> 11:23.717
of a basic headache medication,

11:23.751 --> 11:25.853
let alone reveal it
to the world.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.721
This is what my life
has come to, David,

11:27.755 --> 11:31.024
killing a man over
a complimentary bolus.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.493
- Okay, well are you even sure
that the pill

11:33.526 --> 11:34.862
would have saved his life?

11:34.895 --> 11:36.296
- We'll have to let the courts
decide.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.365
- The courts?

11:38.398 --> 11:40.868
Well, know that you've unloaded
this on me,

11:40.901 --> 11:42.202
what am I, an accomplice?

11:42.235 --> 11:43.503
David, I came here to be talked

11:43.536 --> 11:44.304
not pushed!

11:44.337 --> 11:47.107
- Can you imagine this
in prison?

11:47.140 --> 11:48.876
Patrick: Can I interject?

11:48.909 --> 11:50.143
I know I wasn't supposed
to be listening

11:50.177 --> 11:51.879
to this conversation,
but it's a small space,

11:51.912 --> 11:53.781
and your voice carries
so beautifully.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.249
- Mhm.
- Mrs. Rose, I can say

11:56.283 --> 11:58.518
with 100% certainty, you have
nothing to worry about.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.120
- Well that's very kind of you,
dear,

12:00.153 --> 12:02.155
but now's not the time
for well-intended placation.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.357
- You're legally prohibited
from supplying medication

12:04.391 --> 12:06.159
to your guests,

12:06.193 --> 12:07.995
so by not giving him anything
you've actually avoided

12:08.028 --> 12:10.130
any potential liability
in his death.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.133
- Well, there we have it then.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.035
Thank God you're here Pa...

12:15.068 --> 12:16.837
- ...trick.
- ...trick.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.239
- You know how David can get
carried away, I'm sure.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.274
- Oh, I do.

12:21.308 --> 12:25.846
- Well, I suppose I'll head
back to the scene of the crime,

12:25.879 --> 12:28.481
with which I had nothing to do.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.150
- Can I ring that up for you?

12:30.183 --> 12:33.020
- I paid way too much for
a wedge of brie last week,

12:33.053 --> 12:34.554
so let's call it even.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.156
- I don't think it works
like that.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.291
- Alexis was right,
he's a button.

12:38.325 --> 12:39.960
(Footsteps thud)

12:43.063 --> 12:45.833
(Bell on door chimes,
door opens and closes)

12:45.866 --> 12:47.234
- Thanks.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.037
(Knocks)

12:51.371 --> 12:53.473
(Door opens, baby crying)

12:53.506 --> 12:55.843
- Well, hello there,
my colleague and I

12:55.876 --> 12:58.445
are just checking in to see
how you're enjoying your stay.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.314
- Uh, it is what it is.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.951
- Oh, well that's excellent.
Excellent.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.552
Now, will you be heading out
this afternoon,

13:05.585 --> 13:08.321
or hanging around the motel?

13:08.355 --> 13:09.923
- Uh, I don't know,

13:09.957 --> 13:11.424
I'm just trying to get my kid
to take a nap.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.260
He just gets cranky
if he doesn't, so...

13:13.293 --> 13:15.896
- Ohhhh, my son's the same way.

13:15.929 --> 13:18.966
- Anyway, we just wanted
to come by,

13:18.999 --> 13:21.201
invite you and your son
to our happy hour,

13:21.234 --> 13:24.037
happening in the motel lobby
between 4 and 5 p.m.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.439
- You're inviting my son
to happy hour?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.441
- Well, wrong choice of words.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.244
We prefer to call it
a family hour,

13:31.278 --> 13:33.113
if that makes you feel
any better.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.514
- There's gonna be other kids
there?

13:34.547 --> 13:36.283
- Oh, I think,
- No.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.218
(Baby wailing)

13:38.251 --> 13:40.988
- But there is someone staying
with us right now

13:41.021 --> 13:43.256
who works in a quarry.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.959
So, I bet he has a lot
of stories.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.496
- And what kind of kid
doesn't like rocks?

13:49.529 --> 13:51.031
- Yeah.
- Huh? (Laughs)

13:51.064 --> 13:52.933
Maybe he'll even get to take
one home.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.301
- Ooh.

13:54.334 --> 13:58.205
- I'm gonna think about it.
- Yeah, it's mandatory.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.940
- It's mandatory?

13:59.973 --> 14:03.043
- Well again, wrong choice of
words, it's not mandatory,

14:03.076 --> 14:05.913
but there is a fee
for not attending,

14:05.946 --> 14:07.347
so you'll be paying
for it either way.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.049
- What?

14:09.082 --> 14:10.517
- Yeah, so we'll just be by
a little later

14:10.550 --> 14:12.252
to escort you to the lobby.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.221
- In the meantime,
you can put your son to bed

14:14.254 --> 14:17.390
and just make sure he's up
and ready to go at 3:55.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.360
Okay? Bye for now.
- Bye, thank you.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.895
(Baby crying, throws a cup)

14:21.929 --> 14:23.563
(Door closes)

14:23.596 --> 14:25.432
- All right,
thank you very much,

14:25.465 --> 14:27.367
and we will be in touch.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.537
(Door creaks open and shuts)

14:30.570 --> 14:32.239
I have to admit, Alexis,

14:32.272 --> 14:34.407
some of your questions
were shockingly effective.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.309
I found it very telling
how many people

14:36.343 --> 14:38.245
would just accept a cocktail
from a total stranger.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.079
- Hmm, thank you.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.583
What was he doing here?
- I'm happy to help.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.585
- You know it is gonna be

14:46.987 --> 14:48.922
different around here
without you.

14:48.956 --> 14:51.458
You definitely had a certain
something,

14:51.491 --> 14:53.260
and I can't quite
put my finger on.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.162
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.431
- Thank you!

14:58.465 --> 15:00.900
(Both chuckle)

15:03.603 --> 15:06.406
- So you were gonna ask me
something earlier.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.308
- Oh, sorry yeah, um,

15:08.341 --> 15:10.577
so something gross happened
at the motel,

15:10.610 --> 15:13.947
so I was actually hoping I could
crash at your place tonight.

15:13.981 --> 15:18.218
- Yeah, normally that'd be
totally okay it's just um,

15:18.251 --> 15:20.387
I have a date tonight.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.389
- Oh. Fun.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.027
Okay, um, well maybe I could
like drop my stuff

15:27.060 --> 15:29.196
and wait, or...
- Yeah,

15:29.229 --> 15:31.664
it's uh just kinda that um,

15:31.698 --> 15:34.234
we may uh, you know, need
the apartment at some point.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.972
- Apartment at some point.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.441
My God, like for sex. (Laughs)

15:41.474 --> 15:44.377
I don't know why I thought
you were single.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.080
That's... hmm.

15:47.114 --> 15:49.216
- Yeah, I thought I had
mentioned her, it's Heather,

15:49.249 --> 15:50.250
the woman with the cat.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.121
- Yeah.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.256
- I thought that was like
a little casual thing.

15:56.289 --> 15:59.159
- It was and then it sort
of turned into more of a thing.

15:59.192 --> 16:03.063
- Hmm. Did.
Well, good for Heather.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.099
Thirsty little thing,
isn't she.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.303
Um... okay, okay, cool.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.472
Well um, I should probably go.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.010
- Alexis, wait.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.147
(Dog barks)

16:21.514 --> 16:24.051
Who would you hire from today?

16:25.185 --> 16:28.155
- Um, I liked the guy
with the glasses.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.190
- Me too.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.228
- Um, or the guy with
cystic acne. Either or.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.329
- Okay.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.132
- Or the girl with the oily
braid. Also very good.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.501
- Okay, lots to think
about there.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.671
- Mhmm.
- Thank you, Alexis.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.740
(Footsteps clack,
door opens and shuts)

16:48.841 --> 16:50.277
(Birds chirping)

16:52.512 --> 16:55.048
(Crickets chirp)

16:55.082 --> 16:56.683
(Soft Jazz music plays)

16:57.784 --> 17:00.487
(Approaching footsteps)

17:06.759 --> 17:09.329
- So you told your mom
about us, huh.

17:09.362 --> 17:12.299
- No, I told Alexis about us,

17:12.332 --> 17:14.434
and she likely told my mom.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.607
- Okay, listen David--
- No you listen--

17:20.640 --> 17:22.809
Sorry that came off way harsher
than I wanted it to.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.178
Uh, I know how this looks,

17:26.413 --> 17:28.148
especially considering
that you just told me

17:28.181 --> 17:30.150
you wanted to take things slow,

17:30.183 --> 17:32.652
but me wanting to stay
at your place,

17:32.685 --> 17:35.322
it was more about
what was happening at--

17:35.355 --> 17:37.357
- Yeah, I...I know that now.
- Okay.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.759
- And I'm sorry for assuming
that you just wanted to stay

17:39.792 --> 17:42.795
at my house to...
to sleep with me or whatever.

17:46.466 --> 17:50.303
- No, um, it was purely
circumstantial, you know,

17:51.238 --> 17:53.440
because of the dead body
at the...

17:53.473 --> 17:55.475
- Right.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.777
(Soft Jazz plays)

18:00.147 --> 18:02.081
- You know, when you kissed me,

18:04.617 --> 18:07.220
that, that felt like
my first time.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.858
All the things that
you're supposed to feel,

18:11.891 --> 18:14.561
I-I felt them last night.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.401
- Well, if we're being honest
with each other,

18:21.434 --> 18:25.138
this is sort of like
my first time, too.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.875
I mean, it's not, I've kissed
like a thousand people but...

18:28.908 --> 18:32.545
nobody that I cared about

18:32.579 --> 18:35.415
or... respected...

18:35.448 --> 18:38.751
or thought was nice.

18:41.488 --> 18:45.625
So in a way, it's like we're
both starting something new.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.829
- Thank you, David.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.665
And hey, for the record,

18:52.699 --> 18:55.602
I-I also respect you and think
that you're a good person.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.205
- Hmm.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.772
It's just I said nice person.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.841
- I know.
- Oh.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.281
- I just need you to say
nice person.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.682
- You're a good person.
- That's not nice.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.920
(Gurney clanks)

19:13.953 --> 19:16.856
(Hawaiian music plays)

19:16.889 --> 19:19.492
Johnny: Well, hello everyone,
welcome.

19:19.526 --> 19:23.896
Welcome. Hope you're enjoying
the cinnamon buns and vodka.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.469
We thought it was festive in
a Scandinavian sort of way.

19:32.372 --> 19:35.575
Uh, well what a wonderful
opportunity

19:35.608 --> 19:40.247
for all the guests to uh,
get to know each other.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.319
Anyone from out of town?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.890
Well, that makes sense.
(Laughs)

19:50.923 --> 19:52.725
You're all staying
at the motel.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.494
(Door opens)

19:57.930 --> 20:00.233
Um, oh Frank, Frank...
Frank is here.

20:00.267 --> 20:03.403
Frank who works at a quarry.

20:03.436 --> 20:07.674
Did you bring some rocks
in for the kids, Frank?

20:07.707 --> 20:10.410
- No, I didn't bring any rocks.

20:10.443 --> 20:13.546
- No rocks? Well.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.249
- John, the gentlemen outside
need a few more minutes.

20:17.484 --> 20:20.853
- Well, I hope the motel
has been servicing--

20:20.887 --> 20:24.291
- Well hello, all of you.
Hello, hi.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.959
Isn't this a glittering sea
of hopeful faces.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.998
- My lovely wife, Moira.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.468
Man: We wanna go outside.
- Outside.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.705
- Well of course you do, who
doesn't want to go outside?

20:38.738 --> 20:43.543
But it's also important to
cherish what's going on inside.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.313
It's times like these
that reminds one

20:46.346 --> 20:48.448
of the fact that
we're all still alive.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.318
Don't you dare take that
for granted.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.486
One day you're asking
for an anti-inflammatory,

20:53.520 --> 20:55.722
the next day you've passed away
in your sleep!

20:55.755 --> 20:57.690
- I think we're getting a
little off-topic, sweetheart.

20:57.724 --> 21:01.694
- The point being, no one knows
when we're going to die!

21:01.728 --> 21:03.363
Or be implicated in,

21:03.396 --> 21:05.932
and then suddenly cleared
of someone else's death.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.000
(Corner's van starts)

21:08.034 --> 21:09.936
So, so, drink up! Go outside!

21:09.969 --> 21:12.639
And live your lives!

21:12.672 --> 21:15.475
- And thank you all for
spending this hour with us.

21:15.508 --> 21:18.378
I hope you enjoyed the
complimentary refreshments.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.347
- Okay, people,
let's leave the cups inside.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.981
We're not in Vegas, here.
Thank you.
