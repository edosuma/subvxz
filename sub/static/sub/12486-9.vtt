11:44.705 --> 11:45.850
What?

11:45.851 --> 11:49.393
But I've been collecting that
stuff since I was a youngling!

11:49.394 --> 11:53.447
Look, do you want
Garkon or do you want me?

11:53.448 --> 11:58.751
And just so you know, six more dates and
I'll be ready to take a picture with you.

11:58.752 --> 12:01.932
I'll go get my stuff.

12:05.152 --> 12:09.202
Wow, you got a lot of stupid stuff!

12:09.203 --> 12:11.764
It was weird moving
all this out of my room.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.734
Mostly because I discovered
I have a roommate!

12:14.735 --> 12:17.583
Of course, now I don't
have room for my things,

12:17.584 --> 12:20.573
so I had to move them
into your room temporarily.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.676
Did you have to leave that
fuzzy pink unicorn in there?

12:23.677 --> 12:26.679
That thing creeps me out.

12:26.680 --> 12:30.100
That thing creeps you out?

12:34.200 --> 12:37.523
Stay strong! I know you can do this.

12:37.524 --> 12:41.184
I have faith in you. Now go!

12:41.629 --> 12:43.388
I don't get it.

12:43.389 --> 12:45.765
Look at this dumb comic book...

12:45.766 --> 12:50.287
[Reading] "Under the three moons
of Zaxon, Princess Garkon"...

12:50.288 --> 12:53.108
She's a Princess?

12:53.641 --> 12:56.442
[Continues reading] "Needed new
boots for each of her four feet".

12:56.443 --> 12:59.984
"So she headed to the trading
outpost in the Forbidden Zone"...

12:59.985 --> 13:01.174
[Gasps]

13:01.175 --> 13:03.755
And she shops?

13:07.005 --> 13:09.336
Guys, I have a huge problem!

13:09.337 --> 13:12.275
I've looked everywhere
and I can't find my zPhone!

13:12.276 --> 13:16.013
Okay. Relax. Maybe someone found it.

13:16.014 --> 13:17.664
Uh, here.

13:17.665 --> 13:20.566
Call it in 3D mode and you'll
be able to see who picks up.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.668
Good idea!

13:21.669 --> 13:23.829
[Beeping]

13:24.125 --> 13:26.105
Hello?

13:26.640 --> 13:30.091
Mr. Hashimoto? You have my phone?

13:30.092 --> 13:32.845
[Scoffs] No. This is not Mr. Hashimoto.

13:32.846 --> 13:34.647
My name is... [clears throat]

13:34.648 --> 13:37.850
[In lower voice] Steve Jones.

13:37.851 --> 13:41.566
Oh, no. We've got to figure
out a way to get the phone back!

13:41.567 --> 13:44.518
Okay, but I don't know how we're
going to find this guy's address.

13:44.519 --> 13:47.827
There are, like, a
thousand Steve Joneses.

13:47.828 --> 13:51.008
That was Mr. Hashimoto!

13:51.097 --> 13:54.634
He has all that new technology
now. This could ruin Z-Tech!

13:54.635 --> 13:57.061
Mr. Grundy is going to kill me!

13:57.062 --> 14:00.606
And get away with it
because he has an alibi app!

14:00.607 --> 14:03.668
Wait. I bet Mr. Hashimoto
will be back at the

14:03.669 --> 14:06.196
Sushi bar trying to
reclaim his karaoke crown.

14:06.197 --> 14:07.547
We can go confront him.

14:07.548 --> 14:13.008
We're grounded. And Winter's
watching us like a hawk.

14:18.351 --> 14:19.155
[Growling]

14:19.156 --> 14:20.593
This is Princess Garkon.

14:20.594 --> 14:23.629
The Zaxonites have breached
our security force field!

14:23.630 --> 14:29.502
I'm going to have to engage them in
hand-to-hand to-hand-to-hand combat.

14:29.503 --> 14:31.704
Ah! Not Garkonite!

14:31.705 --> 14:34.741
It's the one substance
that makes me weak!

14:34.742 --> 14:39.002
Luckily, I'm wearing my blaster boots!

14:43.784 --> 14:45.253
"The end"?

14:45.254 --> 14:49.756
But what happened to
the Carpezian space baby?

14:49.757 --> 14:51.691
They didn't tie that up at all!

14:51.692 --> 14:56.072
I've got to get on the message boards!

14:59.245 --> 15:01.225
Chyna!

15:01.351 --> 15:04.604
I discovered this cool
new feature on my zPhone.

15:04.605 --> 15:06.312
Voice spoofing!

15:06.313 --> 15:10.710
"It captures a caller's voice and
allows you to sound exactly like them"?

15:10.711 --> 15:12.826
- This is perfect!
- I know!

15:12.827 --> 15:17.950
We can call Fletcher as Fletcher
and blow his tiny little mind!

15:17.951 --> 15:20.582
Or we can use it to trick Winter...

15:20.583 --> 15:26.307
And get her out of the way so we
can go back to the karaoke bar.

15:26.308 --> 15:27.239
[Ringing]

15:27.240 --> 15:28.528

[As hashimoto] Mr. Hashimoto.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.016
What?

15:33.467 --> 15:35.533
Miss Maddox, I hope
I am not catching you

15:35.534 --> 15:37.130
[as hashimoto] at an inopportune time.

15:37.131 --> 15:40.673
[Sobbing] And my parents said that
Wolfy went to live on a farm...

15:40.674 --> 15:42.136
Not at all.

15:42.137 --> 15:44.297
[Sobbing]

15:45.146 --> 15:47.257
Excellent. I have
been impressed with

15:47.258 --> 15:50.219
[As hashimoto] your business skills.
And I would like to offer you a job.

15:50.220 --> 15:52.785
Heading up my new technology division.

15:52.786 --> 15:57.398
You mean, a job that doesn't
involve working with little brats?

15:57.399 --> 15:59.379
Brats?

15:59.693 --> 16:02.966
[As hashimoto] Interesting factoid.
According to pediatric behaviorologists,

16:02.967 --> 16:06.466
children respond better
to positive messages!

16:06.467 --> 16:09.802
- Anyway, the job starts tomorrow...
- In Tokyo.

16:09.803 --> 16:12.140
You think she bought it?

16:12.141 --> 16:16.281

16:26.259 --> 16:29.061
- What happened to you?
- I got hooked on style.

16:29.062 --> 16:32.265
I started flipping through some of those
fashion magazines you left in my room,

16:32.266 --> 16:34.266
to learn what girls like.

16:34.267 --> 16:36.617
So, do you want to go to the Mall?

16:36.618 --> 16:38.620
Today? We can't go today!

16:38.621 --> 16:40.418
Today's Garkon-Con!

16:40.419 --> 16:43.543
I'm pro Garkon-Con now.

16:43.544 --> 16:46.644
You don't have to be con Garkon-Con.

16:46.645 --> 16:50.157
Is this some kind of
a test? Is this a con?

16:50.158 --> 16:53.219
Is this a Garkon-Con con?

16:53.220 --> 16:56.517
Because, I promise you, I'm
over all that nerdy stuff.

16:56.518 --> 16:58.557
Well, get back under it!

16:58.558 --> 17:02.161
No, thanks. I'll be at the Mall.

17:02.162 --> 17:05.598
Hey, Lexi. Did I hear
you talking about Garkon?

17:05.599 --> 17:08.420
Shaloha, Earthling.

17:09.169 --> 17:12.077
Oh, my gosh! Are you a Garkon fan, too?

17:12.078 --> 17:17.978
If I weren't, would I have spent
$10,000 on real blaster boots?

17:19.074 --> 17:22.411
The actress who plays Garkon
is in town for Garkon-Con!

17:22.412 --> 17:25.019
Do you think maybe you could
use your money and your charm,

17:25.020 --> 17:28.153
but mostly your money,
to get her to come here?

17:28.154 --> 17:32.679
I do have money and
charm! But mostly money.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.402
This is perfect!

17:34.403 --> 17:37.595
Once Seth meets her, he'll totally
nerd-out and remember why he was a fan

17:37.596 --> 17:39.936
and then we can enjoy Garkon together.

17:39.937 --> 17:41.860
That might work!

place watching a television program

17:49.704 --> 17:53.724

17:59.319 --> 18:01.981
There's Mr. Hashimoto. We need a plan.

18:01.982 --> 18:05.264
Okay. We'll need three full-length mirrors
to create a retro-reflective surface...

18:05.265 --> 18:07.159
Is that your only plan?

18:07.160 --> 18:09.887
Hey, when it works, it works.

18:14.939 --> 18:16.813
What did you just call me?

18:16.814 --> 18:20.732
Nothing. I was just ordering Sushi.

18:20.733 --> 18:24.003
Forget that! You have my
zPhone and I need it back!

18:24.004 --> 18:26.465

Fine.

Let's flip a coin to
see who chooses the song.

18:43.263 --> 18:45.740
Is that a million-dollar coin?

18:45.741 --> 18:50.169
Yes. I took it from a plastic
dish at the yacht store.

There's no "heads" on

Only diamond and butler.
