00:43.450 --> 00:45.309
You are listening to "DJ
Racks in the Morning"

00:45.310 --> 00:48.249
on the station that
plays the hits... 109.6.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.449
Today is the big day,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:50.450 --> 00:53.389
It is our annual "Flavors
of Brooklyn" celebration.

00:53.390 --> 00:55.519
We are throwing block
parties all over town.

00:55.520 --> 00:59.129
Make sure you come on down, but
please, please stay hydrated.

00:59.130 --> 01:00.330
It's a scorcher out there.

01:00.407 --> 01:01.635
We don't want you passing out

01:01.660 --> 01:02.999
like somebody's mama at a Drake concert.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.229
Everybody up!

01:04.254 --> 01:06.242
It's time to wake up out your dreams

01:06.267 --> 01:08.556
and face your jacked-up realities.

01:08.581 --> 01:10.738
Mullins, man, it's hot
as balls in here, man.

01:10.763 --> 01:11.939
What happened to the A/C?

01:11.940 --> 01:15.339
Well, the A/C, like most
of y'all in here, is broke.

01:15.340 --> 01:17.079
Yeah, but when is it gonna get fixed?

01:17.080 --> 01:19.610
The repairman said he can't
come by till this evening.

01:19.620 --> 01:20.949
I sweat like crazy.

01:20.950 --> 01:22.349
You stay down there, and I'm likely

01:22.350 --> 01:24.080
to make it rain in
the worst way possible.

01:24.396 --> 01:26.550
Yeah, well, I'm not staying
in this hot-ass oven, man.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.959
It smell like the
devil's ass crack in here.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.295
Besides, I got a truck
in that block party today.

01:32.430 --> 01:34.559
Yo, Green Eyes, come pick
me up in the truck, man.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.000
We got to make sure we get
a good spot on the streets, a'ight?

01:37.570 --> 01:38.599
A'ight.

01:39.588 --> 01:40.627
Hold on.

01:41.788 --> 01:43.569
D-D-Did I hear this right?

01:43.570 --> 01:46.309
You let that Green Eye
fella take your truck alone?

01:46.310 --> 01:47.839
Yeah, well, what's it to you?

01:48.872 --> 01:51.379
Well, first of all, I'm a grown-ass man,

01:51.380 --> 01:54.249
and I ain't calling
another dude "Green Eyes."

01:54.578 --> 01:56.519
And secondly, didn't you say

01:56.520 --> 01:58.789
that this guy's thing
was robbing people?

01:58.790 --> 02:00.389
Used to be. Not no more.

02:00.390 --> 02:02.589
All I know is that the
guys that live in my house,

02:02.590 --> 02:04.789
they did their time and
they learned from it.

02:04.790 --> 02:07.599
This guy, he been doing
criminal stuff recently.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.799
Hey, see, that's what
my food truck is about...

02:10.800 --> 02:12.399
second chances.

02:12.572 --> 02:14.869
Giving people hope
that they can do better.

02:14.870 --> 02:16.200
Me hiring Green Eyes

02:16.210 --> 02:18.339
is me putting my money
where my mouth is.

02:18.340 --> 02:20.809
Okay. Don't say I didn't warn you.

02:20.810 --> 02:22.609
But as a side note,

02:22.610 --> 02:25.279
never literally put
money where your mouth is

02:25.280 --> 02:28.419
because money is known to
have, like, fecal matter on it,

02:28.420 --> 02:30.480
so when you put that money
up in your mouth like that,

02:30.490 --> 02:32.350
and next thing you
know, you're gonna get...

02:34.383 --> 02:36.089
Yeah, I got to get this door fixed.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.959
It always kind of come

There's buildings all over
Brooklyn priced like that.

03:11.730 --> 03:13.948
Motherfuckers is buying
old apartment buildings,

03:13.973 --> 03:15.459
flipping them, then selling them joints

03:16.930 --> 03:17.999
Yo, that's word, man.

03:18.024 --> 03:19.799
They did that to my mom's building, man.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.869
Now she got to bounce all

Mom, I don't want to talk to your ass.

03:29.911 --> 03:31.156
You know what? The thing is, man,

03:31.180 --> 03:33.021
ain't even no brothers on the wall, man.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.349
- Crazy.
- Hey!

03:34.836 --> 03:36.266
Can't park there.

03:36.993 --> 03:38.052
Who says so?

03:38.077 --> 03:40.886
I need this space for my
workers to get in and out.

03:40.911 --> 03:43.205
But this is a big block
party here, my dude.

03:43.230 --> 03:45.429
I'm on a tight construction schedule,

03:45.430 --> 03:48.899
and there's no way that I'm
falling behind and losing money

03:48.900 --> 03:50.429
- because of a block party.
- Mm.

03:50.430 --> 03:51.969
But this is for the neighborhood.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.369
I own this building.

03:53.370 --> 03:55.669
Nobody asked me about any block party.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.169
Well, if you own this building,

03:57.170 --> 03:58.369
how come we never see you around?

03:58.370 --> 04:00.109
Yeah, how come, Mr. Rockefeller?

04:00.134 --> 04:01.979
I bet he don't even live 'round here.

04:01.980 --> 04:03.240
- That's word.
- Tell you something, man.

04:03.250 --> 04:04.709
Just 'cause you own this building

04:04.710 --> 04:05.749
don't make you Brooklyn.

04:05.774 --> 04:07.779
- Brooklyn is for the people.
- That's word.

04:07.780 --> 04:12.119
This building has been
run down for years.

04:12.120 --> 04:14.050
I want to ask you something.

04:14.060 --> 04:16.189
If you love Brooklyn so much,

04:16.190 --> 04:18.189
how come you people didn't buy it?

04:18.190 --> 04:19.790
Oh, so what you trying to say?

04:19.800 --> 04:21.928
You think we don't know what
the word "you people" mean?

04:21.930 --> 04:24.329
See, now, you lucky this
brotha's a changed man,

04:24.330 --> 04:26.330
or he'd whoop your ass three times

04:26.340 --> 04:27.399
for saying some mess like that.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.269
- Whoop his ass, Tray.
- Four times!

04:29.270 --> 04:31.209
I got no time for this.

04:31.210 --> 04:32.609
So buying this building

04:32.610 --> 04:35.110
is supposed to be making
Brooklyn "great again"?

04:37.880 --> 04:39.349
I voted for Obama.

04:39.350 --> 04:40.880
Oh! Oh! Oh!

04:42.080 --> 04:43.680
It's hot as hell out here.

04:43.982 --> 04:45.549
You know it's that
global warming, right?

04:45.550 --> 04:47.901
- Preach, nigga.
- Man-made global warming.

04:47.926 --> 04:49.489
Felony, if you don't
break it down right now.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.829
I'm trying to tell you like this.

04:50.830 --> 04:52.688
Like, it's all the extra
methane in the atmosphere.

04:52.712 --> 04:54.499
- Okay.
- You know the culprit, right?

04:55.300 --> 04:56.899
- Veganism.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

04:56.900 --> 04:58.429
What?

04:58.430 --> 05:00.569
'Cause cows fart methane.

05:00.570 --> 05:02.805
But now you got all these
cows not getting eaten,

05:02.830 --> 05:03.869
but they're still farting.

05:03.893 --> 05:05.169
- Facts, B.
- Science.

05:05.170 --> 05:06.709
- Facts.
- You know what?

05:06.710 --> 05:08.909
You fools could actually
benefit from reading a book

05:08.910 --> 05:11.049
instead of pontificating all the time.

05:11.050 --> 05:13.979
Global warming comes from
the greenhouse effect.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.005
That too.

05:15.030 --> 05:16.830
And the main culprit

05:16.990 --> 05:18.519
is carbon dioxide.

05:18.520 --> 05:19.550
We knew that.

05:19.575 --> 05:22.504
Carbon dioxide comes
from Jheri curl activator.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.729
How you think California got so hot?

05:24.730 --> 05:27.929
- Yo!
- Wow!

05:31.730 --> 05:35.199
Yo, son, I like how you
handled yourself back there.

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
What you mean?

05:36.210 --> 05:39.209
See, my first inclination

05:39.210 --> 05:40.470
would've been to smack fire at him

05:40.480 --> 05:41.879
had he come up on me like that.

05:42.280 --> 05:45.609
But you... you handled
him all intelligent-like.

05:45.610 --> 05:48.219
I guess after 15 years in the pen, man,

05:48.220 --> 05:50.089
I do do things a little differently.

05:50.690 --> 05:52.089
Yeah, I ain't mad at it.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.289
Live a lot longer that way.

05:55.290 --> 05:57.420
Yo. You good?

05:57.430 --> 05:58.689
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

05:58.690 --> 06:01.399
You know, just been
thinking about things is all.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.229
You know, it feels good

06:03.254 --> 06:05.629
not having to look over
my shoulder all the time.

06:05.630 --> 06:06.699
You legit now.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.500
Yeah.

06:08.501 --> 06:10.100
First time in a long time.

06:10.110 --> 06:12.039
Yeah, and I ain't even
mad that, you know,

06:12.040 --> 06:13.309
it's for so much less money.

06:13.310 --> 06:15.109
You ain't getting no raise, Dwayne.

06:15.110 --> 06:16.709
- Right.
- Hey!

06:16.710 --> 06:17.779
Green Eyes getting paid?

06:17.780 --> 06:19.449
Okay, back it up.

06:19.450 --> 06:22.049
Cousin, you ain't shit.

06:22.050 --> 06:24.549
It sounds like here comes
the competition, kid.

06:24.812 --> 06:26.826
Bobby, get those boxes out!

06:26.851 --> 06:28.989

- Could you get that bread?

06:28.990 --> 06:30.320
- Okay.
- I need that bread.

06:30.330 --> 06:31.859
- And get the big bag of Frito.
- I want a raise!

06:31.860 --> 06:33.659

you pay for meals, too?

06:33.660 --> 06:36.129
- Yo, Bobby, come on!
- Crazy, man.

06:40.670 --> 06:42.199

08:35.720 --> 08:37.380
Is there a problem, Officer?

08:37.390 --> 08:38.789
I was just saying it's a waste

08:38.789 --> 08:41.238
'cause I'm on a diet and
I can't eat anything here.

08:41.263 --> 08:43.602
- Oh. Oh.
- It all smells so good, especially yours.

08:43.628 --> 08:45.859
- Thank you, man. You on a diet out here?
- Yeah.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.459
Man, that's like going to a strip club

08:47.460 --> 08:48.860
with a brick tied to your dick.

08:48.870 --> 08:50.669
- Facts.
- Well, listen, here.

08:50.670 --> 08:51.799
Taste this.

08:52.257 --> 08:53.757
We won't tell nobody.

08:55.194 --> 08:56.533
Mmm.

08:57.540 --> 08:58.809
I just gained five pounds.

08:58.810 --> 09:01.109
That's 'cause I just
put a food baby in you.

09:01.810 --> 09:04.000
How you stay so thin working
around all this good food?

09:04.025 --> 09:06.826
Oh, come on, now, you trying to
get in my pants, Officer Dobbs?

09:06.851 --> 09:09.019
Here, take that with you.

09:09.020 --> 09:11.289
Okay, now you're trying
to get in my pants.

09:11.290 --> 09:12.819
You know that.

09:12.820 --> 09:13.889
You know th...

09:14.890 --> 09:16.220
Bobby, Green Eyes.

09:16.230 --> 09:17.620
- What's up?
- Hold the fort down.

09:17.630 --> 09:18.759
Hold the fort down.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.759
What you... Oh, oh, yo.

09:21.921 --> 09:23.190
Yo, that's his moms, yo.

09:23.430 --> 09:24.569
Hey, Ma.

09:24.570 --> 09:26.299
I didn't think you was gonna come.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.699
Oh, I didn't come for you.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.300
I came to give out
fliers for the church.

09:29.310 --> 09:31.509
- Oh.
- But it got so hot, I had to stop.

09:31.510 --> 09:33.170
I figure if these people
can handle the heat,

09:33.180 --> 09:34.779
they'll do well in hell.

09:34.804 --> 09:36.064
Have a seat, Ma.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.379
Let me get you something cool to drink.

09:38.380 --> 09:39.979
I can get you a Green Mile Tea.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.580
It come in small, medium,
or lethal injection.

09:42.590 --> 09:45.589
Why do you have to promote
such negative stereotypes?

09:45.590 --> 09:47.119
Ma, what's negative about it?

09:47.120 --> 09:50.459
Order number 20-to-Life,
your fries are ready!

09:50.460 --> 09:52.029
Order number 20-to-Life!

09:52.730 --> 09:54.859
Now, it's bad enough you went to prison,

09:54.860 --> 09:56.599
but now you want to glamorize it?

09:56.600 --> 10:00.799
Ma, this food truck is my pride and joy.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.869
Next to Amira, it's
my greatest creation.

10:03.870 --> 10:06.160
- What about Shahzad?
- He almost made the list.

10:06.185 --> 10:09.340
Win, your Prison Gang Crepes are ready!

10:09.350 --> 10:10.949
One Prison Gang Crepe.

10:11.198 --> 10:12.727
Enjoy that shit.

10:12.752 --> 10:14.879
See, that's why I didn't
come to visit you in jail.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.619
I didn't want to see
my son behind bars then,

10:17.620 --> 10:20.889
and I don't want to see my
son behind pretend bars now.

10:20.890 --> 10:22.959
Why you think I made
this truck about prison?

10:23.560 --> 10:26.140
I'm turning all the
stereotypes upside down.

10:26.165 --> 10:28.699
Joel, come get your salad tossed!

10:28.700 --> 10:29.926
- Ignore that, Ma.
- Mm-hmm.

10:29.951 --> 10:32.699
I'm setting a positive example, okay?

10:32.700 --> 10:35.539
An ex-con making a contribution.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.769
Look around. Look at all these people.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.839
My food is bringing them together.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.779
Yes, to laugh at you.

10:42.002 --> 10:44.062
I can never do anything good enough.

10:44.450 --> 10:45.909
What else do you want from me, Ma?

10:45.910 --> 10:48.249
I just want you to do the right thing.

10:48.250 --> 10:49.549
- That's it?
- That's it.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.050
Got it.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.350
Joel, come get your salad tossed!

10:54.544 --> 10:56.143
Yo, Joel, hurry up!

10:56.260 --> 10:58.589
I keep waiting to toss your salad!

10:58.590 --> 10:59.829
I'll be right back. Hold on.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.329
- Cuzzo, you all right?
- Yeah.

11:05.330 --> 11:08.739
Maybe my mom's right about me
putting a bad image out there.

11:08.740 --> 11:11.739
Yo, they said the same
thing about NWA, right?

11:11.740 --> 11:13.009
Then a few years later,

11:13.010 --> 11:15.679
"Straight Outta Compton"
is nominated for an Oscar.

11:15.680 --> 11:16.809
That was for screenwriting.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.879
True, but what I'm talking about is,

11:18.880 --> 11:20.279
don't worry about the critics.

11:21.058 --> 11:22.997
You make a good point, Bobby.

11:23.022 --> 11:24.691
My mom's is a critic.

11:24.716 --> 11:26.645
There's only one way to silence critics.

11:26.670 --> 11:27.739
You know what?

11:27.764 --> 11:30.233
It's extremely hard to
make a movie now-a-days.

11:30.560 --> 11:32.921
- I'm talking about winning the Taste-Off!
- Oh!

11:32.946 --> 11:34.759
If the people accept my food,

11:34.760 --> 11:36.699
then they will accept my message.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.005
That'll show my mother that she's wrong

11:38.029 --> 11:39.830
about my food truck being a bad image.

11:39.840 --> 11:41.439
Well, there you go, cuzzo. You got it.

11:42.040 --> 11:43.900
You got it. You got it, bro.

11:45.710 --> 11:47.039
What's up, Green?

11:47.040 --> 11:48.709
It's hotter than a
motherfucker out here.

11:48.710 --> 11:50.509
Yeah. You ain't lying.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.710
What Tray's mom said got me thinking.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.449
Maybe there's more I could be doing now

11:54.450 --> 11:56.980
to make up for all the
bullshit I did back in the day.

11:57.790 --> 11:59.589
You still thinking
about beef with ol' boy?

11:59.590 --> 12:00.789
They pushing folks out their homes

12:00.790 --> 12:02.189
that lived there all their lives.

12:02.695 --> 12:04.794
Like your mom. It ain't right.

12:05.510 --> 12:06.849
What else can we do?

12:06.874 --> 12:08.004
Got to be something.

12:09.670 --> 12:11.129
These buildings got history, man.

12:12.290 --> 12:14.199
Matter of fact, the
one he's tearing down,

12:15.140 --> 12:16.669
Ol' Dirty Bastard grew up there.

12:16.670 --> 12:17.909
- Say word.
- Word.

12:19.810 --> 12:21.009
Word.

12:21.010 --> 12:23.079
All right, everybody,
everybody, attention.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.809
Me and this gentleman to the left of me,

12:24.810 --> 12:26.149
we have a petition, okay?

12:26.150 --> 12:27.379
- Petition!
- Petition.

12:27.404 --> 12:29.474
- Petition for what?
- You know what we gonna do?

12:29.499 --> 12:32.887
We gonna turn this building
into a historical landmark.

12:32.912 --> 12:35.419
We gonna shut your construction down!

12:35.420 --> 12:36.489
- Come on!
- Landmark?

12:36.514 --> 12:37.560
What are you talking about? It's a dump.

12:37.584 --> 12:38.691
What you mean, what I'm talking about,

12:38.715 --> 12:39.775
it's a dump? Let me te... See?

12:39.799 --> 12:41.269
If you sign this petition right here,

12:41.293 --> 12:44.162
you're protecting the
birthplace of Ol' Dirty Bastard.

12:44.517 --> 12:45.916
Who's Ol' Dirty Bastard?

12:45.941 --> 12:47.010
O.D.B.

12:47.035 --> 12:48.035
- Who?
- Who?

12:48.060 --> 12:50.128
- Come on, son. Dirt McGirt.
- Mm-hmm.

12:50.153 --> 12:51.216
- Big Baby Jesus.
- Well...

12:51.241 --> 12:52.439
- Dirt Dog?
- Uh-huh.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.379
- Ason Unique?
- Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

12:54.380 --> 12:55.709
What is that, voodoo?

12:55.710 --> 12:57.040
No, it ain't no voodoo!
That's not voo...

12:57.050 --> 12:59.489
That's Wu-Tang! Wu-Tang forever!

13:04.990 --> 13:07.389
All right. What do you think?

13:07.390 --> 13:09.708
That's not bad for our
first project together.

13:10.771 --> 13:12.659
Well, we only had,
what, 10 fights over it.

13:12.660 --> 13:15.099
Maybe fighting is a part of our process.

13:15.124 --> 13:17.123
Like Kanye and Jay-Z.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.599
Well, I'm sure Kanye never
threw bolts of fabric at Jay-Z.

13:23.335 --> 13:24.664
Mm.

13:24.940 --> 13:27.679
Oh! All right. Well,
let me get out of here.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.674
- Enjoy the, uh, block party.
- Mm-hmm.

13:29.699 --> 13:30.809
- Mwah. Mwah.
- Mwah. Mwah.

13:30.834 --> 13:31.874
Bye, boo.

13:31.950 --> 13:32.950
- Hey, Faith.
- Hey!

13:32.951 --> 13:34.210
- How are you?
- Good.

13:34.220 --> 13:35.349
Good.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.050
I-I'm gonna change and take a shower.

13:39.560 --> 13:42.859
It is hot as hell out there.

13:42.884 --> 13:44.283
Mm-hmm.

13:51.770 --> 13:54.839
- Thank goodness for the left nipple.
- Ah!

13:54.840 --> 13:56.039
Yeah.

13:56.064 --> 13:58.994
- Thank goodness for the right nipple.
- Aah!

13:59.180 --> 14:01.379
Thank goodness for that belly button.

14:01.380 --> 14:02.439
Uh-huh.

14:02.464 --> 14:04.085
Ooh! Thank goodness for that ear.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.049
Oh, gosh. You know what, babe?

14:06.050 --> 14:09.319
This is actually not
that, uh, comfortable.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.549
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

14:10.574 --> 14:12.989
Neither was wearing stilettos
with the French maid outfit,

14:12.990 --> 14:14.450
but I didn't complain.

14:14.460 --> 14:15.559
- Did I?
- No.

14:15.584 --> 14:16.984
- Get with the program.
- All right.

14:17.060 --> 14:18.859
Thank goodness for the sternum.

14:18.860 --> 14:20.129
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

14:20.130 --> 14:22.399
Are you really gonna
do, like, every... Ohh!

14:23.701 --> 14:27.130
Man, according to this
weather app, it's 101 degrees.

14:27.140 --> 14:28.199
Damn!

14:28.200 --> 14:30.600
Yo, instead of always downloading apps

14:30.610 --> 14:31.892
and letting the other man get paid,

14:31.916 --> 14:33.615
- why don't we start making our own?
- Uh-huh.

14:33.639 --> 14:35.764
- I agree with you fully there, brother Fels.
- Hmm.

14:35.789 --> 14:37.582
Like, instead of using
Waze, we need to come up

14:37.606 --> 14:39.810
with, like, a black version
and call it Blaze, right?

14:39.820 --> 14:42.479
And not only does it keep you
out of the reach of the police,

14:42.480 --> 14:44.680
but it gets you there 10 minutes earlier

14:44.690 --> 14:46.019
to account for C.P. Time.

14:46.020 --> 14:47.219
- I'm feeling that.
- Give me that.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.619
Or, like, you know what I'm saying?

14:48.620 --> 14:50.020
Like a-a-a "Candy Crush"

14:50.030 --> 14:51.681
but it's got Jolly Ranchers
and Now and Laters.

14:51.705 --> 14:53.009
- Oh, a-a-and the Hot Chew.
- Can't y'all think of something

14:53.033 --> 14:55.432
other than the black version
of things that already exist?

14:55.700 --> 14:57.029
We supposed to be innovators,

14:57.030 --> 14:59.314
like the Egyptians, like the Moors.

14:59.339 --> 15:01.369
- The Wakandans.
- Whoo! Wakanda forever.

15:01.370 --> 15:02.370
What's going on, fellas?

15:02.371 --> 15:03.469
- Bobby!
- Hey!

15:03.494 --> 15:04.695
We need you all to sign this petition.

15:04.719 --> 15:06.259
- Oh, yeah. I'm in.
- Who we saving?

15:06.284 --> 15:07.882
Rainforest? Whales?

15:08.310 --> 15:10.179
Those little white seals
that they make coats from?

15:10.180 --> 15:12.309
You ain't talking about the baby
seals on... on the commercial?

15:12.310 --> 15:13.710
All of them little seals.
Don't get me started again.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.119
- They're cute.
- There you go.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.249
Man, y'all niggas don't
even know what y'all signing.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.390
All right. But I signed it already.

15:17.414 --> 15:18.514
- It's too late.
- Yeah, me too.

15:18.538 --> 15:19.668
Yo, it's Old Man Potter down the way

15:19.692 --> 15:20.932
trying to turn that
building on the corner

15:20.956 --> 15:22.855
into condos that
people can't afford, yo.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.479
That old rat-infested building?

15:24.764 --> 15:26.835
- I'm glad to see him do something with it.
- Shit.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.729
I can't believe you're
taking his side right now.

15:28.730 --> 15:30.199
Me and him, we're property owners,

15:30.200 --> 15:32.999
so him renovating that
building is good for my house.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.730
That's real selfish, Mullins.

15:34.740 --> 15:36.869
- Look, we got to stick together.
- Oh, we're gonna stick together?

15:36.870 --> 15:39.339
Okay, so the next time
my mortgage is due,

15:39.340 --> 15:41.009
you're gonna help me with that?

15:41.010 --> 15:42.479
Huh? What?

15:42.480 --> 15:44.679
Yeah, I-I didn't think so.

15:44.680 --> 15:45.949
You're a cold piece of work.

15:45.950 --> 15:47.819
Look, y'all can't stop progress.

15:47.820 --> 15:50.349
And as far as those seals that
you're talking about on TV...

15:50.350 --> 15:52.549
- Yeah?
- ... they look delicious.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.150
- Oh, come on!
- Oh, man.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.559
Mak... Making me hungry.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.020
Shit, I'm gonna... I'm
gonna eat up the seal meat.

15:57.030 --> 15:58.489
Something's wrong with you, Mullins.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.029
All right, listen! Listen!

16:00.030 --> 16:02.299
Please, everybody pass it around.

16:02.300 --> 16:05.469
We want to protect historic
Brooklyn from people like...

16:06.170 --> 16:09.100
like that dude who doesn't
want to share with everyone!

16:09.110 --> 16:10.839
- Now, that's good for Brooklyn.
- What?

16:10.840 --> 16:12.909
- This isn't Manhattan!
- What about the community?

16:12.910 --> 16:14.570
They can move somewhere else.

16:17.980 --> 16:20.510
Calm down! Wait a... Calm down!

16:20.520 --> 16:22.119
Hey! Stop!

16:22.144 --> 16:23.273
Shut up! Okay?

16:23.450 --> 16:25.719
We're here to have fun, not fight!

16:25.720 --> 16:26.919
Gene, take a breather.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.319
Linda, take a walk.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.159
- Talk to you later, Linda.
- All right, boo.

16:30.661 --> 16:32.791
Everybody else, go on
about your business.

16:33.825 --> 16:36.105
Bobby, you can't be out
here starting trouble, man.

16:36.130 --> 16:38.329
Yeah. People have a lot
of feelings about this.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.469
You got to be careful.

16:39.470 --> 16:40.539
But I hear you.

16:41.140 --> 16:42.669
Wu-Tang Clan is my shit.

16:42.670 --> 16:44.200
That's why I rock with you.

16:44.210 --> 16:46.070
Officer Dobbs, baby, cool.
Baby, Wu-Tang forever.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.539
Yeah. Just don't break the law.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.479
Ladies and gentlemen, the votes are in,

16:49.646 --> 16:53.215
and the winner for the "Flavors
of Brooklyn" Taste-Off is...

16:53.750 --> 16:55.019
Last Meal on Wheels.

16:55.020 --> 16:56.880
- Give it up.
- What? Yes!

16:56.890 --> 16:58.749
Congratulations, brother.

16:58.750 --> 17:01.559
- Come on up here.
- Yeah! Come on!

17:03.830 --> 17:04.829
- Yes!
- Yes, baby!

17:04.830 --> 17:07.089
Yes! Yes!

17:07.099 --> 17:08.628
- Hold this for me, Bobby.
- Gotcha.

17:08.654 --> 17:09.784
Yo, what up, Brooklyn?

17:11.829 --> 17:13.699
Let me tell you something, man.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.368
My food truck is personal.

17:16.170 --> 17:19.369
It's about redemption, about life.

17:20.380 --> 17:21.539
It's about love.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.709
Take my Radiator Chicken, for instance.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.979
The right hand is the Kool-Aid
powder used in the brine.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.719
It's tart, abrasive, but yet colorful.

17:30.720 --> 17:34.250
The left hand is the jelly
packages from Church's Chicken

17:34.260 --> 17:35.589
I used in the marinade

17:35.590 --> 17:38.059
after the brine has been
sitting there for hours.

17:38.060 --> 17:40.990
It's added later, and it
comes in fancier packages.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.760
But my story's about Brooklyn.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.599
Static. Who will win?

17:45.600 --> 17:48.469
Too much of the right hand,
this chicken will be salty,

17:48.470 --> 17:50.269
dry, and mad as hell.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.339
Too much of the left hand and
it's gonna be soft, boring,

17:53.340 --> 17:55.540
and can't take the
heat from the radiator.

17:55.550 --> 17:57.140
But you put them together,

17:57.150 --> 17:59.110
and it's gonna be something delicious.

17:59.135 --> 18:00.195
Love.

18:00.220 --> 18:01.358
Thanks for coming out.

18:04.950 --> 18:06.350
Uh, well, all righty, then.

18:06.360 --> 18:07.819
Give it up for your winner, everybody.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.359
- Give it up!
- Last Meal on Wheels.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.420
Give them some.

18:14.030 --> 18:15.360
Hey.

18:15.370 --> 18:17.429
What in the world?

18:17.454 --> 18:19.030
Oh, come on, son!

18:19.040 --> 18:21.030
Yo, they got to do this right now?

18:21.040 --> 18:23.439
- There it is. Static.
- See?

18:23.440 --> 18:24.839
See, that's what I'm
talking about right there.

18:24.840 --> 18:25.970
That's why we got to shut them down.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.439
Oh, yeah. They gonna feel our presence.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.309
- No, what you talking about?
- No, no, no, no.

18:29.310 --> 18:30.709
I got... I see the violent
look in your eyes, man.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.179
- What you talking about?
- I g... I got this, cuzzo.

18:32.180 --> 18:33.849
- Wait a minute.
- Don't worry about it.

18:33.850 --> 18:35.249
- I got this.
- Where you going?

18:35.250 --> 18:36.649
Make them show us respect!

18:36.650 --> 18:38.589
Green Eyes, could you
get my keys from him?

18:38.590 --> 18:39.850
That's my keys and my truck.

18:39.860 --> 18:41.589
Bobby, you need to sit down somewhere.

18:41.590 --> 18:42.659
Come on, Bobby.

18:42.684 --> 18:44.389
Bobby, come on, man! Stop acting crazy!

18:44.390 --> 18:46.590
- I got this!
- Gets so angry.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.999
♪ Fight the power ♪

18:48.000 --> 18:49.960
Bobby, what are you doing?

18:50.962 --> 18:51.992
Bobby!

18:56.140 --> 18:57.940
Yo, watch it!

19:01.389 --> 19:02.789
Move the truck!

19:02.950 --> 19:04.340
- We ain't going nowhere, dawg.
- Bobby. Bobby.

19:04.350 --> 19:06.549
Get this monstrosity out of here!

19:06.550 --> 19:08.349
- We ain't going nowhere!
- Bobby, no.

19:08.350 --> 19:10.149
- This is our block party and our neighborhood!
- Bobby!

19:10.150 --> 19:11.489
- Come on, man!
- That's right, damn it!

19:11.490 --> 19:13.419
- You better move the truck...
- Come on, Bobby.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.420
... or else.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.020
- Come on!
- Or else what, man?!

19:16.030 --> 19:17.289
Oh, you ain't gonna do
nothing, and you know it!

19:17.290 --> 19:18.429
Shut the music off now!

19:18.430 --> 19:20.029
I ain't shutting nothing down, man!

19:20.030 --> 19:21.299
- You're not shutting it down?
- It's a block party.

19:21.300 --> 19:22.629
You're not shutting the music off?

19:22.630 --> 19:24.029
I'm gonna shut it off for you!

19:24.030 --> 19:25.899
Man, you ain't gonna do nothing.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.099
Come on, Bobby. Come on, Bobby.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.299
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

19:28.300 --> 19:30.900
Back off! Back off!

19:30.910 --> 19:31.969
Whoa, whoa.

19:31.970 --> 19:33.070
Back off!

19:33.780 --> 19:35.179
- No!
- No, no, no!

19:35.180 --> 19:36.979
Come on! Come on, man! Come on, man!

19:36.980 --> 19:38.179
- Come on, man!
- No, no!

19:38.180 --> 19:40.249
- Oh!
- Come on, man.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.379
Ah! What are you doing?!

19:42.380 --> 19:44.249
Yo, man, you lucky
you got that pipe, man!

19:44.250 --> 19:46.850
No! No, man!

19:46.860 --> 19:50.120
Now we put you out of business.

19:50.795 --> 19:52.255
And we didn't need a petition.

19:55.470 --> 19:58.269
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!

20:05.034 --> 20:06.340
You mother...

20:06.341 --> 20:09.140
Get off me!

20:28.160 --> 20:31.829
No! No! No!

20:31.830 --> 20:33.969
I can't breathe!

20:33.970 --> 20:35.439
I can't breathe!

20:35.440 --> 20:37.509
Dobbs, you know him. You know him!

20:37.510 --> 20:40.109
Do something! Do something!

20:40.639 --> 20:42.038
Please!

20:42.063 --> 20:43.262
Do something!

20:43.910 --> 20:45.309
Do something!

20:45.310 --> 20:47.049
- That's enough!
- Get off me!

20:47.050 --> 20:49.120
- That's enough! Come on!
- Get off me!

20:50.790 --> 20:51.950
Aah!

20:52.725 --> 20:53.984
No!

20:58.060 --> 21:00.259
Green! Green, pick it up!

21:00.260 --> 21:01.599
Get up, man! Come on!

21:01.600 --> 21:03.329
Hurry up. Come on! Come on!

21:03.330 --> 21:05.370
Let's go! Come on!

21:09.410 --> 21:10.540
Shit!

21:15.410 --> 21:16.879
Shit.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.459
Tray.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.499
Tray, what are you doing?

21:36.932 --> 21:39.531
Tray. Tray, don't!

21:39.556 --> 21:40.586
Cuzzo.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.139
Tray.

21:42.304 --> 21:43.403
- Cuzzo!
- Don't.

21:44.240 --> 21:45.770
Don't do this, Tray.

21:46.383 --> 21:48.653
- Tray, you don't want to go back to jail!
- Cuzzo!

21:48.677 --> 21:50.177
Don't do this!

21:52.850 --> 21:54.620
Tray, don't.

21:57.590 --> 21:59.119
Tray, don't!

21:59.120 --> 22:00.850
Tray, the kids! Tray!

22:00.860 --> 22:02.089
You have children now!

22:02.486 --> 22:03.616
They need you.

22:03.641 --> 22:05.040
We have kids, Tray.

22:05.065 --> 22:06.325
They need you.

22:06.350 --> 22:07.549
We need you.

22:07.961 --> 22:09.821
Tray! Don't!

22:09.846 --> 22:10.906
We need you.

22:36.748 --> 22:37.947
Rough night, huh?

22:39.270 --> 22:40.569
Uh, thank you, Shay.

22:40.960 --> 22:41.960
Ohh.

22:45.399 --> 22:47.338
It all happened so fast.

22:48.176 --> 22:49.969
Even when I do right, I end up losing.

22:50.422 --> 22:51.909
The truck can be replaced.

22:52.208 --> 22:53.909
That's what insurance is for.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.440
Thank God the policy's in Josh's name.

22:56.803 --> 22:58.579
He gets those white-boy rates.

22:58.770 --> 23:00.289
I messed up again, Shay.

23:01.145 --> 23:03.145
Just when I started to
make something of myself,

23:03.170 --> 23:04.249
I end up losing.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.919
What if that's just
the way it is with me?

23:07.233 --> 23:09.114
What if I'm always gonna lose?

23:09.606 --> 23:10.720
Don't say that.

23:10.881 --> 23:11.910
Why not?

23:12.550 --> 23:13.859
You've seen it before.

23:14.222 --> 23:16.161
Some people just can't
get out of their own way.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.249
Tray, when you first got out of prison,

23:18.551 --> 23:20.511
I thought you'd be back
in there within two weeks.

23:20.708 --> 23:21.807
You've grown so much.

23:21.832 --> 23:23.219
You've gone from someone I hated

23:23.244 --> 23:25.633
to someone I consider to be my friend.

23:26.760 --> 23:29.440
If you can overcome that,
you can overcome anything.

23:32.480 --> 23:33.480
Thanks.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.995
Oh, don't flatter yourself.
This is morning wood.

23:42.011 --> 23:43.059
That's all it is.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.409
They arrested your friend.

24:00.086 --> 24:01.415
Least he's alive.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.540
Thank you.

24:03.408 --> 24:04.568
Cost me my job.

24:06.029 --> 24:07.158
They're gonna fire you?

24:07.648 --> 24:09.578
Nah. Gonna be forced to quit.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.079
They can't do that.

24:12.883 --> 24:14.912
Who's gonna come if I call for backup?

24:15.696 --> 24:17.435
I'm risking my own safety staying on.

24:17.842 --> 24:18.941
Damn.

24:20.484 --> 24:22.953
How are things gonna change if
we start punishing the police

24:22.978 --> 24:24.569
for doing what they're supposed to do?

24:25.179 --> 24:26.809
Your guess is as good as mine.

24:29.681 --> 24:32.551
Man, I should have eaten
there when I had the chance.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.109
It was good.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.080
It was good, Tray.

24:43.690 --> 24:44.789
Hey, Dobbs.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.666
You owe me $2.50 for
that free food I gave you.

24:49.270 --> 24:50.369
Fuck you, Tray.

24:50.394 --> 24:51.394
Love you, too.

25:01.041 --> 25:02.715
Wondering when you was
gonna bring your trifling,

25:02.739 --> 25:04.300
food-truck-burning ass back here.

25:04.688 --> 25:06.148
I don't want to hear it, Mullins.

25:06.173 --> 25:07.967
Well, you need to hear this.

25:09.332 --> 25:11.179
It's from the Department of Corrections.

25:11.435 --> 25:12.480
Came yesterday.

25:17.808 --> 25:20.342
Notice of time served?

25:21.212 --> 25:22.351
Your time's up here.

25:23.213 --> 25:25.529
You got two weeks to find
you a new place to live.

25:30.452 --> 25:31.981
Everybody up.

25:32.411 --> 25:34.211
- Everybody up.
- Oh, come on, dawg.

25:34.236 --> 25:36.101
Time to wake up from your dreams

25:36.126 --> 25:38.034
and face your jacked-up reality.

25:44.384 --> 25:47.080
Before you say anything,
just hear me out.
