00:01.252 --> 00:03.786
Danny:  What's wrong with you.
Tucker: Nothing is wrong with me, man.

00:03.952 --> 00:05.186
Dude, just let it go.

00:05.286 --> 00:06.653
No, I'm not
letting it go.

00:06.755 --> 00:08.388
Look, all I'm saying is
if you're gonna bring home

00:08.489 --> 00:09.789
a supermodel,

00:09.890 --> 00:12.092
you should make sure
you have one for everyone.

00:12.193 --> 00:14.027
Milena and I just
started dating.

00:14.128 --> 00:16.096
I don't even know if she has
any other supermodel friends.

00:16.197 --> 00:18.732
Dude, everyone knows
they travel in packs, man.

00:19.934 --> 00:21.101
Look, all I need to do

00:21.202 --> 00:24.303
is just peel a slow one
off the herd.

00:25.404 --> 00:26.438
Wait, guys.

00:26.539 --> 00:27.906
I think Emma just
said her first words.

00:28.007 --> 00:29.108
- Really?
- What'd she say?

00:29.209 --> 00:31.643
She said,
"Shut up already!"

00:32.846 --> 00:34.079
We've been listening
to this whining

00:34.180 --> 00:35.280
for the last 20 minutes.

00:35.381 --> 00:37.216
Danny, can't you
help Tucker out?

00:37.316 --> 00:39.284
Come on.

00:39.385 --> 00:40.385
( Mouths )

00:41.519 --> 00:43.221
- Okay, fine.
- Yes!

00:43.321 --> 00:44.722
Thank you, Emma.

00:45.891 --> 00:46.991
Hey, I cannot believe

00:47.092 --> 00:48.592
you're not trying
to get in on this.

00:48.693 --> 00:50.928
I think I've just got different
priorities these days.

00:51.029 --> 00:54.431
I want someone special.
Someone who gets me.

00:54.532 --> 00:56.800
I guess I'm looking for--

00:56.901 --> 00:57.934
Hey, Riley.

00:58.035 --> 00:59.035
Oh, hi.

01:16.086 --> 01:18.720
Making pancakes, huh?

01:18.822 --> 01:19.989
Blueberry banana.

01:20.590 --> 01:22.291
Remind me again whose
favorite those are?

01:22.392 --> 01:23.592
No idea.

01:25.195 --> 01:26.796
Are you actually making
blueberry banana?

01:26.797 --> 01:27.997
Those are my
absolute favorite.

01:29.064 --> 01:30.765
They are?
Really?

01:30.866 --> 01:33.401
That is so-- what?

01:36.338 --> 01:38.372
Okay, what's going on?

01:38.473 --> 01:39.507
You told me just
the other day

01:39.608 --> 01:40.775
that you were
completely over Ben.

01:40.876 --> 01:42.476
Yeah, well, that was
the other day.

01:42.577 --> 01:43.711
So, keep up.

01:45.079 --> 01:47.414
I thought I was,

01:47.515 --> 01:49.016
but then we were at
Katie and Dave's wedding

01:49.117 --> 01:51.018
and we were
dancing on the roof.

01:51.119 --> 01:52.359
I don't know,
for the first time

01:52.386 --> 01:54.321
I just felt
a real connection.

01:54.422 --> 01:55.689
Did something
actually happen?

01:55.790 --> 01:57.224
No, but...

01:57.325 --> 01:59.226
Come on.
I've been able to manufacture

01:59.327 --> 02:01.227
a whole 10-year
relationship in my head

02:01.328 --> 02:02.494
based on nothing.

02:02.595 --> 02:05.932
So imagine what I can do
with a few soulful glances.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.235
Hey, have you guys
seen this website

02:09.336 --> 02:10.703
that Katie and Dave put up?

02:10.804 --> 02:13.739
Everyone's posting
links and pictures.

02:13.841 --> 02:16.775
Dammit, if I even look good
doing the electric slide.

02:16.876 --> 02:19.444
Did you see that?
That is-- I told you.

02:19.545 --> 02:20.912
Wow, Riles.

02:21.013 --> 02:22.380
I think you'd totally
win the award

02:22.481 --> 02:23.849
for cutest bridesmaid.

02:27.486 --> 02:29.254
Please tell me I'm
not really watching you

02:29.355 --> 02:30.288
hit on Riley.

02:30.389 --> 02:32.123
I can't help it.

02:32.225 --> 02:33.657
I think--

02:33.758 --> 02:35.559
I think I might really like her.
I don't know.

02:35.560 --> 02:37.527
You lived across the street
from her your entire life.

02:37.628 --> 02:38.662
How could you
not know?

02:39.831 --> 02:40.952
She did shove me
in my locker

02:40.966 --> 02:42.032
every day
of fifth grade.

02:43.301 --> 02:45.269
But we danced together
on the roof at the wedding

02:45.370 --> 02:47.437
and a part of me

02:47.538 --> 02:49.505
hasn't been able to stop
thinking about her.

02:49.606 --> 02:51.307
Which part?

02:52.408 --> 02:55.111
All of them.

02:55.212 --> 02:57.180
And they don't
usually agree.

02:58.916 --> 03:00.984
Is it insane to think
that she could ever like me?

03:01.085 --> 03:03.286
If she did, I'm sure she
would have given you a sign.

03:03.387 --> 03:05.620
Hey Ben, the law firm
that I'm interning for

03:05.721 --> 03:06.642
is having
this big party

03:06.722 --> 03:08.090
and we all get
to bring dates.

03:08.191 --> 03:11.126
If you're asking me,
it's an unqualified "yes."

03:11.227 --> 03:12.667
If that was just
general information,

03:12.695 --> 03:13.996
have a great time.

03:15.564 --> 03:16.531
I was asking.

03:16.632 --> 03:17.665
I'd love to.

03:21.103 --> 03:23.404
And that is what
we call a sign.

03:27.009 --> 03:29.243
Hey, you sure
about this?

03:29.344 --> 03:31.779
I mean, I just don't
want you to get hurt.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.115
I know he's my brother
and I love him,

03:34.216 --> 03:36.117
but it's Ben.

03:36.218 --> 03:38.084
I know, I know.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.120
But I really feel
like he's changing.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.055
You know, he's not
"that guy" anymore.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.924
Oh oh oh, Ben!

03:44.025 --> 03:45.425
Ben, you gotta
come look at this.

03:46.660 --> 03:48.328
Somebody posted you

03:48.429 --> 03:50.430
on "he said he'd
call" dot com.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.366
"He said he'd call"
dot com?

03:54.467 --> 03:56.068
That's this website
where women post the names

03:56.169 --> 03:58.770
of jerks who say
they'll call, but don't.

03:58.871 --> 04:00.005
Ben.

04:00.106 --> 04:02.641
There is no reason
I should be on that website.

04:02.742 --> 04:03.642
Susie Kettle.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.210
Oh, maybe.

04:06.813 --> 04:07.879
Wait, Susie Kettle?

04:07.981 --> 04:09.981
Bridesmaid
Susie Kettle?

04:10.082 --> 04:11.782
Yeah, most likely
that Susie Kettle.

04:11.883 --> 04:13.117
But nothing happened.

04:13.218 --> 04:14.718
I was just all,
"Hey, Sus, nice catching up.

04:14.820 --> 04:15.786
Maybe I'll
call you sometime."

04:15.887 --> 04:17.255
Yeah, was that
before or after

04:17.356 --> 04:18.656
you were making out
with her on the dance floor?

04:18.757 --> 04:19.790
Possibly after.

04:19.891 --> 04:21.259
You made out with Susie
at the wedding?

04:21.360 --> 04:23.694
- Just a little--
- Girl, we had to get the hose.

04:25.296 --> 04:26.663
But you said
you'd call her?

04:26.764 --> 04:28.598
- Well, yeah.
- And did you?

04:28.699 --> 04:30.600
- Well, no.
- Oh my God, Ben.

04:30.701 --> 04:33.437
- What is wrong with you?
- I truly don't know.

04:33.537 --> 04:35.072
You are <i>that guy.</i>

04:35.173 --> 04:36.940
That guy that every girl
is warned about

04:37.041 --> 04:38.741
but every woman thinks
that she can change.

04:38.843 --> 04:40.677
And I swear, I've
known you my whole life

04:40.778 --> 04:42.411
but I have no idea
who you are.

04:42.512 --> 04:43.846
I mean,
who raised you?

04:43.947 --> 04:45.848
Morning, boys.

04:48.852 --> 04:50.219
Grandma in the house.

04:50.320 --> 04:52.955
And I need 20 bucks
for the cab driver.

04:53.056 --> 04:55.691
He didn't go for
my flirty face.

04:57.193 --> 04:58.626
Hey, Riley.
Trust me.

04:58.727 --> 04:59.894
I'm not that guy.

04:59.996 --> 05:02.497
Ben, you are the cover boy
of "That Guy Quarterly."

05:02.598 --> 05:04.366
And I know
because I subscribe.

05:05.834 --> 05:06.801
What's wrong?

05:06.902 --> 05:07.935
Your son is selfish
and immature

05:08.037 --> 05:09.404
and has no
respect for women.

05:09.505 --> 05:12.974
In related news, the sun
came up and the sky is blue.

05:14.842 --> 05:16.176
Ooh. Pancakes.

05:20.382 --> 05:21.748
Okay, Emma.

05:21.849 --> 05:23.650
Are you ready to be
Grandma's wingbaby?

05:23.751 --> 05:25.019
I have decided

05:25.120 --> 05:27.421
that today is the day
I am finally gonna talk

05:27.522 --> 05:29.088
to the hottest guy
this side--

05:29.189 --> 05:30.823
♪ Hello. ♪

05:31.924 --> 05:32.992
<i>There he is.</i>

05:33.093 --> 05:36.062
Now remember, I get the
one who's potty-trained.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.134
Did you see that look?

05:41.235 --> 05:42.402
Oh.

05:42.503 --> 05:45.137
Why did I only shave
up to my knees this morning?

05:46.639 --> 05:47.939
Now watch and learn, Emma.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.442
First impressions
are everything.

05:50.543 --> 05:52.944
Excuse me,
is this seat available?

05:53.046 --> 05:54.079
Sure is.

05:58.051 --> 06:01.352
Just like the woman
sitting across from it.

06:07.959 --> 06:09.326
What is wrong
with you?

06:09.428 --> 06:11.962
You're jumping every time
somebody walks in the door.

06:12.064 --> 06:13.730
I called Susie
and invited her

06:13.831 --> 06:14.798
to come by the bar.

06:14.899 --> 06:16.133
Oh, excellent.

06:16.234 --> 06:18.168
A little pedal
to the Kettle.

06:18.269 --> 06:19.735
( Chuckles )

06:19.836 --> 06:21.504
No no. I don't want
to go out with her.

06:21.605 --> 06:23.005
I just really want
to get off that website.

06:23.107 --> 06:25.075
So you thought
making her

06:25.176 --> 06:27.077
come across town
on her lunch hour

06:27.178 --> 06:29.745
to be dumped
a second time would do it?

06:29.846 --> 06:32.415
No, but a little
Wheeler charm

06:32.516 --> 06:34.749
and a free Caesar
salad just might.

06:34.850 --> 06:37.386
I think you're
overestimating the food here.

06:39.489 --> 06:40.956
Hey, can I get
another one of these?

06:41.057 --> 06:42.391
Yeah.

06:42.492 --> 06:45.094
And a side of
what Danny's having.

06:48.131 --> 06:51.332
And this is how we say
good-bye in Russian.

06:51.433 --> 06:54.469
And this is how we say "I'll
call you later" in American.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.347
So?

07:07.448 --> 07:08.928
Did you talk about me?
What'd she say?

07:09.850 --> 07:11.017
She said yes.

07:11.119 --> 07:12.051
It's a double date
tomorrow night.

07:12.153 --> 07:14.187
Yes! Tucker is
in the game.

07:14.288 --> 07:15.288
Oh, yeah!

07:17.958 --> 07:19.025
Hey, Riles.

07:19.127 --> 07:20.660
Riley. What are you doing here?

07:20.761 --> 07:22.761
Not here to see you.
I'm just looking for Danny.

07:22.862 --> 07:24.497
Hey, so about your
party tomorrow night.

07:24.598 --> 07:26.132
Oh, you know what?
Don't even worry about it.

07:26.233 --> 07:27.399
I got it covered.

07:27.501 --> 07:29.602
So can I get
a glass of water?

07:29.702 --> 07:31.837
Or do you need to
make out with someone first?

07:34.307 --> 07:38.209
So, you're completely
over Riley, right?

07:38.310 --> 07:39.544
Riley?

07:39.645 --> 07:40.745
Yeah, totally.

07:40.846 --> 07:42.480
So over her.
Just a stupid crush.

07:42.581 --> 07:43.948
Hey, Wheeler.

07:44.049 --> 07:46.151
Any chance I can talk you into
being my date tomorrow night?

07:46.252 --> 07:48.486
Yeah, totally.
That'd be fun.

07:49.488 --> 07:50.921
What? Oh no.

07:51.023 --> 07:52.457
Uh-uh.
You are not about

07:52.558 --> 07:54.057
to dethrone
the king of cool.

07:54.159 --> 07:56.960
Did you see
those moves? No!

07:58.296 --> 07:59.596
Oh, hey.

07:59.697 --> 08:01.064
Sue Sue Susie-o.

08:01.166 --> 08:03.167
It's so good to see
you you you-io.

08:04.602 --> 08:07.037
Not my standard greeting.
Come over here.

08:08.839 --> 08:09.838
So much quieter.

08:09.939 --> 08:11.674
<i>( Cars honking )</i>

08:11.775 --> 08:14.743
Look, I'm really sorry
I hadn't called before today.

08:14.844 --> 08:16.279
I've just been swamped.

08:16.380 --> 08:18.113
Work, baby.

08:18.215 --> 08:20.249
Crazy hectic life
of a single father.

08:20.350 --> 08:21.717
You want off
that website,

08:21.818 --> 08:23.052
try this.

08:23.153 --> 08:24.720
Tell me the truth.

08:24.821 --> 08:25.987
What happened
that night?

08:26.088 --> 08:28.056
Let me help you.

08:28.157 --> 08:31.259
We were dancing
and having a great time.

08:31.360 --> 08:33.794
And then you kissed me and
said we should get together.

08:33.895 --> 08:35.962
And then you went up to
the roof to get some air,

08:36.065 --> 08:38.032
and I never heard
from you again.

08:38.133 --> 08:39.167
I remember.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.268
So why didn't
you call, Ben?

08:41.369 --> 08:42.836
Did you meet
someone new?

08:45.840 --> 08:48.409
Yeah, I kind of did
meet someone new.

08:48.510 --> 08:50.777
Or at least the girl I'd
never really seen before.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.345
And did you
call her?

08:54.014 --> 08:55.014
I'm working on it.

08:57.017 --> 08:58.117
I just hope
she answers.

09:04.059 --> 09:05.659
Hey, can I
ask you a question?

09:05.760 --> 09:07.594
Just between us
and be honest.

09:07.996 --> 09:09.096
Oh, God, yeah.

09:09.197 --> 09:10.597
The hair is definitely
starting to look

09:10.698 --> 09:12.366
a little boy band-y.

09:12.467 --> 09:13.633
No!

09:13.734 --> 09:15.102
No.

09:15.203 --> 09:16.503
I wanted to
ask you something.

09:16.604 --> 09:17.972
What do you think
about Riley?

09:18.073 --> 09:20.106
I think she's destroying
any chance of me

09:20.207 --> 09:21.707
ever dating
a supermodel,

09:21.808 --> 09:22.808
so not a huge fan.

09:24.411 --> 09:25.544
More specifically,

09:25.645 --> 09:27.947
what do you think
about Riley and me?

09:28.048 --> 09:30.683
( Scoffs )
There's no Riley and--

09:30.784 --> 09:32.285
wait.

09:32.386 --> 09:33.953
<i>You</i> like Riley?

09:35.055 --> 09:36.488
I think I do.

09:36.589 --> 09:38.069
But I don't even know
if she likes me.

09:38.124 --> 09:39.891
That party would
have been perfect.

09:39.993 --> 09:42.627
We could have started
where we left off.

09:42.728 --> 09:45.730
Do you think there's any way we
can convince Danny to back out?

09:53.005 --> 09:55.006
Trust me. If there
is, we'll find it.

09:58.076 --> 09:59.410
Come on, just
make up an excuse

09:59.511 --> 10:01.178
and I'll be there
as her only option.

10:01.279 --> 10:04.115
If that's not romantic,
I don't know what is.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.551
It's not like you want
to go with her, right?

10:07.652 --> 10:09.952
I mean, how many
times have you told me

10:10.054 --> 10:13.189
that you have no feelings
for her whatsoever?

10:13.290 --> 10:14.530
Why would he ever
tell you that?

10:14.591 --> 10:17.227
Because he--

10:17.328 --> 10:18.395
didn't.

10:18.496 --> 10:19.929
( Mouthing )

10:20.031 --> 10:21.711
You know, Riley's not
just some random girl

10:21.732 --> 10:23.099
you can get
and then forget.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.233
She's my best friend.

10:24.334 --> 10:25.267
And I'm not gonna
let you hurt her

10:25.368 --> 10:26.268
just because
you maybe might kinda

10:26.369 --> 10:27.269
have some feeling.

10:27.370 --> 10:28.370
Once it's out there,

10:28.471 --> 10:29.405
it's out there
forever.

10:29.506 --> 10:30.605
You can't
walk it back.

10:30.706 --> 10:32.074
I'm not gonna hurt her.

10:32.175 --> 10:33.608
I would never
do that to Riley.

10:33.709 --> 10:34.876
I just need
to prove to her

10:34.977 --> 10:36.611
that I'm not <i>that</i> guy.

10:36.712 --> 10:38.780
Danny, please.

10:41.716 --> 10:42.783
Okay, fine.

10:42.884 --> 10:44.618
Both:
Yes.

10:44.719 --> 10:46.220
Okay.
Give me 10 minutes.

10:46.321 --> 10:47.321
This will be amazing.

10:50.659 --> 10:53.261
So it looks like
we're back on.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.530
You know these girls
are really tall, right?

10:57.631 --> 10:59.699
Perfect.
( Laughs )

10:59.800 --> 11:02.769
Because I like
a good climb.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.704
Oh.

11:07.708 --> 11:08.942
Danny, no.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.277
I've already
told everyone

11:10.378 --> 11:11.611
that I was
bringing a date.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.879
I've been all over the web
mocking the other intern

11:13.980 --> 11:15.581
for bringing her brother.
Danny--

11:16.716 --> 11:17.683
Oh, hey Riley.

11:17.784 --> 11:18.817
Hey.

11:18.918 --> 11:20.319
Did Danny
cancel on you?

11:20.420 --> 11:21.620
Tough break.

11:21.721 --> 11:24.090
What are you
doing here?

11:24.191 --> 11:25.591
Just brought
my baby down

11:25.692 --> 11:27.993
to pick up my paycheck
from my steady job.

11:29.528 --> 11:31.629
But this isn't about me.
This is about helping you

11:31.730 --> 11:32.863
find the perfect date
for your party.

11:32.965 --> 11:34.632
Oh, and in related news,

11:34.733 --> 11:36.733
I talked to Susie Kettle,
and I'm off that website.

11:36.735 --> 11:38.336
- Ben.
- I'd love to go with you.

11:38.437 --> 11:39.537
Thanks for asking.

11:39.638 --> 11:41.973
So, on a scale
of one to 10,

11:42.074 --> 11:44.208
one being naked,
how dressy?

11:46.244 --> 11:47.611
Okay, fine.

11:47.712 --> 11:49.279
You can go with me,

11:49.380 --> 11:51.281
but this party is
a really big deal, okay?

11:51.382 --> 11:53.550
So you can't screw it up
being all...

11:53.651 --> 11:54.585
Ben.

11:54.685 --> 11:56.153
Ben-Ness in check.

11:56.254 --> 11:58.622
I'm truly there
just for you.

11:58.723 --> 11:59.923
So it's a date?

12:00.024 --> 12:00.956
Yeah.

12:01.057 --> 12:01.991
I guess it kind of is.

12:02.092 --> 12:03.426
Oh good.
There you are.

12:03.527 --> 12:05.294
- Oh, hi Mom.
- Not you. Emma.

12:05.395 --> 12:07.296
We're meeting Marcus
and his grandson

12:07.397 --> 12:08.397
in 20 minutes.

12:08.499 --> 12:11.066
Wow, you look great,
Mrs. Wheeler.

12:11.168 --> 12:13.009
And I totally didn't mean
to sound so surprised

12:13.036 --> 12:14.737
when I said that.

12:14.838 --> 12:16.538
The only problem,

12:16.639 --> 12:19.341
I wore my stand-up jeans
and my sit-down shoes.

12:19.442 --> 12:21.743
Maybe I can find
a comfortable place to lean.

12:22.845 --> 12:24.012
So this guy's
pretty special?

12:24.113 --> 12:25.280
I think so.

12:25.381 --> 12:27.215
I honestly don't
know much about him

12:27.316 --> 12:28.283
other than the fact
that he owns

12:28.384 --> 12:29.951
a chain of dry cleaners.

12:30.052 --> 12:32.686
That's kind of
the exciting part, you know?

12:32.787 --> 12:34.288
Discovering who he is.

12:34.389 --> 12:35.922
What he's passionate about.

12:36.024 --> 12:37.424
So as it turns out,

12:37.526 --> 12:39.960
baking soda really isn't
the miracle cleaner

12:40.061 --> 12:41.529
everyone
thinks it is.

12:41.630 --> 12:44.331
Breaking down enzymes
isn't enough.

12:44.432 --> 12:45.966
You need something
that lifts.

12:46.067 --> 12:48.934
Wow!

12:49.036 --> 12:53.239
Who knew there were
so many kinds of stains.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.608
And those were just
the greasy ones.

12:55.709 --> 12:57.644
Don't even get me
started on pet stains.

12:57.744 --> 12:58.878
Oh, I promise.

13:00.581 --> 13:01.581
But not to change
the subject--

13:01.682 --> 13:03.416
Oh my God, please do.

13:03.517 --> 13:05.484
You know what's
really hard to get out?

13:05.585 --> 13:06.585
Wine stains.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.220
I wish I had
a wine stain

13:08.321 --> 13:11.089
to suck on
right now.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.924
Marcus, would you
look at the time?

13:13.025 --> 13:14.660
I don't have
a watch on.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.961
Neither do I.
( Chuckles )

13:17.063 --> 13:19.097
But you know, I can
just-- I can just feel...

13:19.199 --> 13:21.031
Life passing me by.

13:21.132 --> 13:22.466
So, you know what?

13:22.568 --> 13:24.068
Ben will have a fit

13:24.169 --> 13:26.237
if I do not get
Emma home soon.

13:26.338 --> 13:27.338
So...

13:29.908 --> 13:31.275
Are you okay?

13:31.376 --> 13:34.245
I will be as soon as I cut
myself out of these jeans.

13:34.346 --> 13:36.279
I can't believe
I have to find

13:36.380 --> 13:37.714
another place
to have coffee.

13:40.718 --> 13:42.219
- Whoo.
- Hey, Mom.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.953
Best part
of that date,

13:44.054 --> 13:45.054
leaving.

13:46.390 --> 13:47.957
What are you doing
back so soon?

13:48.058 --> 13:49.226
I thought you were
gonna have Emma tonight.

13:49.327 --> 13:52.128
I feel like I did
have Emma tonight.

13:52.229 --> 13:53.128
( Chuckles )

13:53.230 --> 13:54.263
I'm sorry.

13:54.364 --> 13:55.404
Can you help me with this?

13:55.498 --> 13:56.498
Yeah, sweetie.

13:57.701 --> 13:58.767
You know, Ben.

13:58.868 --> 14:00.936
I know that people
accuse you of being

14:01.037 --> 14:02.338
immature, selfish, lazy--

14:02.439 --> 14:05.274
Where are you
going with this, Mom?

14:05.375 --> 14:07.809
Well, I just see how hard
you're working to change,

14:07.910 --> 14:11.446
and you're really not
<i>that</i> guy anymore.

14:13.081 --> 14:14.415
You're growing up to be
an amazing young man

14:14.516 --> 14:16.476
and I just want you to know
how proud I am of you.

14:16.485 --> 14:19.287
Thanks, Mom.

14:19.388 --> 14:20.622
You okay?

14:20.723 --> 14:22.490
Just thinking about
the first time

14:22.591 --> 14:23.991
I helped you
tie your tie.

14:24.092 --> 14:25.992
Christmas at Nana's?

14:26.093 --> 14:28.161
Juvenile court.

14:30.798 --> 14:32.266
There.

14:32.367 --> 14:33.367
So handsome.

14:34.535 --> 14:36.069
Now I just need a kiss
from my other girl,

14:36.170 --> 14:37.271
and I'll be
ready to go.

14:37.372 --> 14:39.038
I really am sorry
about your date, Mom.

14:39.140 --> 14:42.375
I just can't believe
I was so off my game.

14:42.476 --> 14:43.542
I mean, normally,

14:43.644 --> 14:45.444
I have a sense
about these things.

14:45.545 --> 14:47.613
- Mom?
- Yeah, sweetie?

14:56.555 --> 14:59.257
Is it just me, or does Emma
look a little different?

15:02.931 --> 15:06.547
Mom? Why am I standing here
holding a black baby?!

15:09.181 --> 15:10.347
You know what?
Actually, Ben,

15:10.448 --> 15:12.283
that is a very good question.

15:12.384 --> 15:14.552
Are you sure that she's
not in there somewhere?

15:14.653 --> 15:15.953
Mom, where's Emma?!

15:16.055 --> 15:18.656
Well, obviously
she's with Marcus.

15:18.757 --> 15:21.892
Who should have no trouble
getting her to sleep.

15:24.595 --> 15:27.097
We must have accidentally
switched the strollers.

15:27.198 --> 15:28.598
I mean, it could
happen to anyone.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.366
I want my baby back.
You call him.

15:30.467 --> 15:32.468
Right. Right.
I have his number

15:32.570 --> 15:33.804
in my phone.

15:33.905 --> 15:36.739
Oh, see how
smart you are?

15:36.840 --> 15:38.074
Okay. Okay.

15:38.175 --> 15:40.176
- It's ringing.
- <i>( Cellphone rings )</i>

15:44.981 --> 15:46.248
Hello.

15:46.349 --> 15:47.482
Marcus?

15:47.584 --> 15:48.617
No, it's not Marcus!

15:50.620 --> 15:52.220
You have his phone
and his baby.

15:52.321 --> 15:53.402
What's the matter
with you?!

15:54.489 --> 15:55.890
Why hasn't he
called you back?

15:55.991 --> 15:58.059
I might have given him
a fake number.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.327
Oh God.

16:00.662 --> 16:02.230
Wait. Wait.

16:02.331 --> 16:04.032
I have a card
he gave me

16:04.133 --> 16:05.533
for one of his
dry cleaners.

16:05.634 --> 16:06.968
Okay. Okay.
All right.

16:07.069 --> 16:08.202
Um... uh...

16:08.302 --> 16:09.703
Ah-ha.

16:09.804 --> 16:11.939
( Emphatically )
Ah-ha.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.808
I used it for gum.

16:17.645 --> 16:20.214
So your mother brought home
the wrong baby

16:20.314 --> 16:23.217
and now Emma is lost
somewhere in Manhattan?

16:23.317 --> 16:27.220
Ben, that is the lamest
excuse I have ever heard.

18:15.357 --> 18:18.391
It was a combination of
several different types.

18:18.492 --> 18:19.492
And I had to treat...

18:24.297 --> 18:26.799
- Hey.
- Danny, what are you doing here?

18:26.900 --> 18:29.168
Ben called and said he wasn't
sure if he could make it.

18:29.269 --> 18:31.189
And I couldn't leave you
standing here all alone.

18:32.605 --> 18:34.005
My God, Danny.

18:34.106 --> 18:35.940
You're truly just
the sweetest thing ever.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.876
I don't know what I did
to deserve you.

18:37.977 --> 18:40.311
Just keep being you.

18:41.781 --> 18:43.415
So, should we
hit the dance floor?

18:43.516 --> 18:46.217
Show them some
of our moves?

18:46.318 --> 18:47.352
We could, but

18:47.453 --> 18:49.553
I didn't know
you were coming.

18:49.654 --> 18:51.188
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

18:51.289 --> 18:53.858
Perfect. I could
really use a drink.

18:55.394 --> 18:57.628
Sorry, I don't
have any change.

18:57.729 --> 19:00.130
Oh, Danny,
this is Fitch.

19:00.231 --> 19:01.399
He really is a doctor

19:01.500 --> 19:03.200
and he's the brother
of the other intern.

19:03.301 --> 19:04.967
How crazy is that?

19:05.068 --> 19:06.536
Danny's my
oldest friend.

19:06.637 --> 19:07.904
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

19:08.005 --> 19:10.607
Yeah. Likewise.

19:10.708 --> 19:13.209
So, do you want
to head back out

19:13.310 --> 19:14.950
on the dance floor?
Show the folks at home

19:14.978 --> 19:16.979
some more of those
amazing moves?

19:18.315 --> 19:19.382
Do you mind?

19:20.784 --> 19:22.284
So you don't need me?

19:22.385 --> 19:24.453
No, I think I'm good.

19:24.554 --> 19:27.523
Then you go
have fun.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.257
I've actually got
someone waiting for me.

19:39.267 --> 19:41.035
<i>( Slow music playing )</i>

19:54.715 --> 19:56.316
I'm here.
I made it. Whoo!

19:58.285 --> 19:59.619
You're a little late.

20:10.129 --> 20:12.197
So what do you think, Emma?

20:12.998 --> 20:14.600
How do I get
to be that guy?

20:31.427 --> 20:34.027
( Phone beeps, dialing )

20:36.765 --> 20:39.000
Hey, Marcus.

20:39.101 --> 20:41.335
Yeah, it's Bonnie Wheeler.

20:41.436 --> 20:44.004
Yeah, I hope it's
not too late,

20:44.105 --> 20:46.340
but, um, I was having
a little trouble sleeping

20:46.441 --> 20:47.674
and...

20:47.775 --> 20:51.111
I was just wondering if
maybe you could help me out.

20:53.914 --> 20:55.082
Yeah.

20:55.183 --> 20:57.749
I think I might have
gotten a coffee stain

20:57.851 --> 20:59.118
on my blouse earlier.

21:00.988 --> 21:02.221
Uh-huh.

21:03.423 --> 21:05.324
It was cotton.

21:05.425 --> 21:06.993
Yep.

21:07.094 --> 21:08.327
Oh, yeah.

21:08.428 --> 21:09.996
Mm-hmm.

21:12.431 --> 21:15.533
