WEBVTT

00:06.560 --> 00:08.498
Fuck me.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.643
You missed it, didn't you?

00:11.882 --> 00:13.150
This is what happened.

00:13.151 --> 00:15.585
Get your shit together, will ya?

00:15.586 --> 00:17.622
I own two commercial properties.

00:17.623 --> 00:19.359
I would like to get
this one off my hands.

00:19.360 --> 00:20.695
Can you do $350,000?

00:20.696 --> 00:22.332
I could probably get a
loan for that much.

00:22.333 --> 00:23.367
- Good.
- But the building's

00:23.368 --> 00:24.768
not worth more than $250,000.

00:26.174 --> 00:28.544
The adoption papers thing,
pretty tricky stuff.

00:28.545 --> 00:30.014
You didn't know the difference

00:30.015 --> 00:31.951
between adoption forms
and sales documents.

00:31.952 --> 00:34.189
Wordy stuff confuses me,
and it's not the same.

00:34.190 --> 00:36.961
And taking our bar is way worse
than being stupid, it's cunty.

00:36.962 --> 00:39.566
<i>I hate AA, I think it's
fucking stupid, but I went.</i>

00:39.567 --> 00:41.303
You really want to stop drinking?

00:41.304 --> 00:42.805
- I mean, do you really want to?
- Yes.

00:42.806 --> 00:44.376
I hope I see you at the next meeting.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.913
I'm getting some new IDs, some cash,

00:45.914 --> 00:47.983
and heading to Mexico. You should come.

00:47.984 --> 00:50.254
Come with you to Mexico?

00:55.332 --> 00:56.533
Fuck you, Gallagher.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.474
Monica?

01:00.475 --> 01:01.978
Come on. Come on, open your eyes.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.614
Don't leave me, Monica!

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

02:43.058 --> 02:45.494
Go! Move it, move it, move it! Go!

02:45.495 --> 02:48.167
Come on, now, move it,
girls! Move your asses!

02:48.168 --> 02:50.204
You are pitiful!
Move it! Look at you!

02:50.205 --> 02:52.141
I've never seen a more pitiful group

02:52.142 --> 02:54.379
of would-be soldiers in my life!

02:54.380 --> 02:56.450
Move it! Up and over! Cut through!

02:56.451 --> 02:59.289
Hop to it! Get your asses
in the dirt, you maggot!

02:59.290 --> 03:00.491
Let's move it!

03:00.492 --> 03:03.530
Let's go, move it! Move it!

03:03.531 --> 03:05.735
Gallagher!

03:05.736 --> 03:07.739
- Get your ass over here, cadet!
- Sir, yes, sir!

03:07.740 --> 03:08.875
Chaplain wants to see you.

03:08.876 --> 03:09.910
Sir?

03:09.911 --> 03:12.482
Shit if I know, son. Move it.

03:12.483 --> 03:14.085
Jesus, Jackson,

03:14.086 --> 03:17.392
get your lazy ass moving
under that goddamn wire!

03:31.788 --> 03:33.724
You reach Ian?

03:33.725 --> 03:36.363
I texted him. Carl?

03:36.364 --> 03:37.865
Called the school,
said they're gonna try

03:37.866 --> 03:40.204
to get him on a train tonight.

03:48.521 --> 03:49.991
She look dead to you?

03:52.429 --> 03:55.434
I only saw her for a second

03:55.435 --> 03:57.205
when they were putting
her in the ambulance.

03:57.206 --> 03:59.910
She shit herself?

03:59.911 --> 04:02.014
People shit themselves when they die.

04:02.015 --> 04:04.052
That's why they put
diapers on psycho killers

04:04.053 --> 04:06.056
before they give 'em
the lethal injection.

04:06.057 --> 04:08.026
I touched her when they
put her in the ambulance.

04:08.027 --> 04:09.863
She was still warm.

04:09.864 --> 04:11.767
Could have still been dead.

04:11.768 --> 04:13.637
Body only loses a couple degrees of heat

04:13.638 --> 04:14.806
an hour after you kick it.

04:14.807 --> 04:16.276
Really?

04:16.277 --> 04:18.579
Lots of things in the
body are still alive.

04:18.581 --> 04:22.555
Hair, the skin, the nails, all
the bacteria in your guts.

04:22.556 --> 04:24.726
And you don't start to swell up
for at least a couple of days,

04:24.727 --> 04:26.730
and then your eyes pop out,

04:26.731 --> 04:28.600
skin falls off, then you explode.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.669
Kev.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.441
What?

04:37.987 --> 04:39.256
Gallagher?

04:40.659 --> 04:42.663
Yeah.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.106
Dr. Caughey. Monica your mother?

04:48.107 --> 04:50.377
Yeah. Um, Fiona.

04:50.378 --> 04:51.881
- Philip and Debbie.
- Hi.

04:51.882 --> 04:53.717
Your mother came in unresponsive.

04:53.718 --> 04:55.254
We made every attempt to revive her

04:55.255 --> 04:57.226
but we were unsuccessful.

04:59.330 --> 05:00.431
So she's dead?

05:00.432 --> 05:02.502
Yes.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.672
Drug overdose?

05:04.673 --> 05:08.841
No, she died from a
massive cerebral hemorrhage.

05:11.621 --> 05:15.294
A blood vessel in her brain burst.

05:15.295 --> 05:18.100
Would you like to see her?

05:18.101 --> 05:20.871
I would.

05:20.872 --> 05:22.608
Okay, sure.

05:22.609 --> 05:24.613
Give us a few minutes and
we'll bring you back.

05:28.288 --> 05:29.289
Where's Frank?

05:29.290 --> 05:30.992
Outside still, I think.

05:30.993 --> 05:32.361
I'll go get him.

05:32.362 --> 05:33.999
No, I-I'll do it.

05:59.650 --> 06:02.122
Jesus, it's freezing out here.

06:10.672 --> 06:12.476
She died, Frank.

06:22.162 --> 06:26.771
They said that we can go in
and see her, say good-bye.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.585
They're gonna send someone to talk to us

06:34.586 --> 06:36.424
about what we want to do with her body.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.807
Did Monica ever talk about
what she might want?

06:49.984 --> 06:52.088
Come on.

06:52.089 --> 06:54.159
Let's go say good-bye.

06:57.733 --> 06:58.835
Frank.

07:56.083 --> 07:58.053
All right, I'm
taking Franny up to bed.

07:58.054 --> 07:59.655
Yeah, sounds good.

07:59.656 --> 08:00.959
I'm gonna make coffee.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.329
Thanks, Fi.

08:03.664 --> 08:05.501
Hey, look who the cat dragged in.

08:07.072 --> 08:09.141
The fuck you been?

08:09.142 --> 08:10.913
Um, work.

08:14.253 --> 08:15.354
Thanks.

08:15.355 --> 08:16.757
There's leftover chicken.

08:20.198 --> 08:21.433
Franny's sleeping.

08:27.512 --> 08:30.484
Think we should call Bill?

08:30.485 --> 08:31.653
We even have his number?

08:31.654 --> 08:32.655
Who's Bill?

08:32.655 --> 08:33.991
Your Granddad.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.827
I have a granddad named Bill?

08:35.828 --> 08:38.832
You have an asshole named
Bill who was Monica's father.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.169
Where's he live?

08:40.171 --> 08:42.140
- Iowa?
- Indiana.

08:42.142 --> 08:45.013
When's the last time you saw him?

08:45.014 --> 08:46.049
Like, never.

08:46.050 --> 08:47.685
Fuck him.

08:47.686 --> 08:49.655
It's not like he ever wanted
anything to do with us.

08:49.656 --> 08:51.326
What's that?

08:51.327 --> 08:53.129
Emergency Room bill.

08:53.130 --> 08:55.535
They charge you even if you die?

09:00.545 --> 09:03.283
Wow. Think any of this is real?

09:03.284 --> 09:04.819
Anything worth more than a nickel

09:04.820 --> 09:07.225
she would have pawned years ago.

09:17.746 --> 09:19.916
All that's Monica's stuff?

09:19.917 --> 09:22.021
Yeah.

09:22.022 --> 09:23.423
My God.

09:23.424 --> 09:24.426
Fuck.

09:25.728 --> 09:27.164
Wow.

09:30.505 --> 09:31.707
Jesus.

09:39.790 --> 09:41.059
Hey, Debs. Tic TAC?

09:41.060 --> 09:42.394
Eww.

09:42.395 --> 09:43.395
What is...

09:47.405 --> 09:48.541
What the fuck is this?

10:00.798 --> 10:02.001
What's the tag say?

10:03.070 --> 10:05.807
"36 and Racine."

10:05.808 --> 10:09.482
And then "33... 7,"

10:09.483 --> 10:12.421
or maybe it's a "1-2-8-8-4."

10:12.422 --> 10:14.158
Monica had an apartment?

10:14.159 --> 10:18.633
Not a chance. Probably some dump
she was evicted from years ago.

10:18.634 --> 10:20.505
Anybody got a rock and a lighter?

12:40.084 --> 12:41.653
Fuck, Frank.

14:24.859 --> 14:27.230
You smell bacon?

14:29.268 --> 14:31.538
Hey, Carl.

14:31.539 --> 14:34.879
My God. Hi!

14:36.884 --> 14:38.052
Wow!

14:38.053 --> 14:40.056
Holy shit, it's Lieutenant Dan!

14:40.057 --> 14:41.592
Come here, man.

14:41.593 --> 14:43.195
I gotta salute you now or something?

14:44.265 --> 14:45.867
Where did you get all this stuff?

14:45.868 --> 14:47.871
I stopped by the Aldi on the
way from the train station.

14:47.872 --> 14:48.974
Well, why didn't you just call me?

14:48.975 --> 14:50.376
I could have picked you up.

14:50.377 --> 14:51.712
You have a car?

14:51.713 --> 14:53.149
She's a rich lady now.

14:53.150 --> 14:54.518
Look at those stripes and ribbons!

14:55.521 --> 14:57.090
You're a general now?

14:57.091 --> 15:00.229
Hey, Cadet Corporal, get to
kick some lazy freshman ass.

15:00.230 --> 15:01.732
Everybody, is scrambled all right?

15:01.733 --> 15:03.069
- Yeah.
- Just the neighbors,

15:03.070 --> 15:04.671
bringing 10,000-calorie sugar bombs.

15:04.672 --> 15:06.575
- Nice.
- Yo, Carl!

15:06.576 --> 15:09.882
Look at you! The ghetto ninja warrior!

15:09.883 --> 15:12.287
Should I be afraid, your
hands licensed to kill now?

15:12.288 --> 15:13.957
What's up?

15:13.958 --> 15:16.029
Carl! Hey, you're home.

15:18.066 --> 15:20.236
- Hey.
- Neil, Carl's back.

15:20.237 --> 15:23.242
Anybody up for going to the
mortuary with me later,

15:23.243 --> 15:24.745
figure out what to do with Monica?

15:24.746 --> 15:26.048
We can't just leave her there?

15:26.049 --> 15:27.650
Called in sick

15:27.651 --> 15:29.254
the last couple of days. I gotta work.

15:29.255 --> 15:30.656
Yeah, I got something I
have to do this morning,

15:30.657 --> 15:32.160
then I got my shift over at Patsy's.

15:32.161 --> 15:33.496
- Hey, I'll go.
- Really?

15:33.497 --> 15:34.498
Yeah, sure.

15:34.499 --> 15:35.968
I can come.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.337
With the Alibi gone, I've
got nothing but time.

15:37.338 --> 15:38.672
What happened to the Alibi?

15:38.673 --> 15:39.976
Svetlana stole it from them.

15:39.977 --> 15:41.178
How do you steal a bar?

15:41.179 --> 15:43.749
Russian KGB sneaky Putin shit.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.453
I'm working at the Fairy Tail now.

15:45.454 --> 15:46.522
You are?

15:46.523 --> 15:48.125
I'm making "beau-coo" tips.

15:48.126 --> 15:50.463
Ancient queens love the
impossible-to-get thing.

15:50.464 --> 15:52.100
Even more Benjamins to be had

15:52.101 --> 15:53.702
if I let the old dudes
give me hand jobs.

15:53.703 --> 15:54.906
Not gonna happen.

15:54.907 --> 15:56.943
Little help here.

15:56.944 --> 15:57.945
I mean, a hand's a hand, right?

15:57.946 --> 15:59.381
That's what I said!

15:59.382 --> 16:01.084
I don't know. I prefer the hands

16:01.085 --> 16:03.756
yanking my Johnson to be soft,
petite, and wearing nail polish.

16:03.757 --> 16:05.660
There's plenty of that
over at the Fairy Tail.

16:05.661 --> 16:07.998
Why don't I just pick him up
and you pull out his thing?

16:07.999 --> 16:10.102
Feel good to piss standing
up again won't it, big man?

16:10.103 --> 16:11.573
I guess.

16:17.919 --> 16:19.254
I gotta go to Patsy's this morning,

16:19.255 --> 16:21.124
so early afternoon for the mortuary?

16:21.125 --> 16:22.794
Absolutely.

16:22.795 --> 16:24.031
Good to have you home.

16:26.669 --> 16:28.606
So, if I want to let a dude jerk me off,

16:28.607 --> 16:30.176
how much could I make?

16:31.881 --> 16:33.884
Have a nice day.

16:37.391 --> 16:39.227
- Morning, boss.
- Morning.

16:57.264 --> 17:00.136
<i>Darrgen Sheet Metal.</i>

17:00.137 --> 17:02.607
Hi, can I speak to Bill Darrgen please?

17:02.608 --> 17:03.609
<i>Who's calling?</i>

17:03.610 --> 17:05.881
Fiona Gallagher.

17:05.882 --> 17:07.384
<i>Um, he's not here.</i>

17:08.988 --> 17:11.058
Can I leave a message?

17:11.059 --> 17:12.060
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

17:13.730 --> 17:16.300
Tell him Monica died.

17:16.301 --> 17:17.704
<i>Monica who?</i>

17:19.575 --> 17:21.079
His daughter, Monica.

17:39.916 --> 17:41.284
Is Brad around?

17:43.123 --> 17:44.225
Thanks.

17:57.886 --> 18:00.556
Nice bike.

18:00.557 --> 18:03.095
'78 Shovelhead.

18:03.096 --> 18:04.597
You like bikes?

18:04.598 --> 18:07.704
I don't really know much about 'em.

18:12.514 --> 18:15.921
I woke up this morning feeling
like I really needed a drink.

18:15.922 --> 18:18.759
Yeah? Why's that?

18:18.760 --> 18:20.097
My mom died last night.

18:24.305 --> 18:27.978
This is strange, you know?
She was a junkie...

18:27.979 --> 18:29.048
and a drunk.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.156
Think the last thing I
wanted was a drink.

18:36.262 --> 18:37.498
You good with your hands?

18:39.602 --> 18:41.338
Yeah, I've been working on that knitting

18:41.339 --> 18:43.342
like you suggested. I got
that slip stitch down,

18:43.343 --> 18:47.083
but that purl shit, it's
giving me some trouble.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.521
Tell you what, help me put
this wheel on this bike,

18:49.522 --> 18:52.461
hit up the IHOP. I'll buy
you a pile of pancakes.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.305
Give me a sec.

19:02.748 --> 19:04.584
There's a guy here, says you
were supposed to meet him

19:04.585 --> 19:06.589
this morning but didn't show?

19:18.780 --> 19:20.149
You forget me?

19:20.150 --> 19:22.753
Sorry, I had a-a family thing come up.

19:22.754 --> 19:24.190
So you're still interested, that wasn't

19:24.191 --> 19:26.127
just your unsubtle way of telling me

19:26.128 --> 19:27.363
you never want to see me again?

19:27.364 --> 19:29.767
N-no, I'm-I'm still interested.

19:29.768 --> 19:31.504
Do you want some coffee?

19:31.505 --> 19:33.543
- Yeah, yeah, coffee'd be great.
- Okay.

19:39.355 --> 19:41.324
I was thinking we should
just use lawyers,

19:41.325 --> 19:43.562
save us the real estate commission.

19:43.563 --> 19:45.132
Yeah, sounds smart.

19:45.133 --> 19:47.136
Okay, good. Well, I got a guy,

19:47.137 --> 19:49.540
unless you have a lawyer
that you like to use.

19:49.541 --> 19:52.214
No, no, your... your guy'll be fine.

19:53.750 --> 19:57.023
So, I made some copies of the inspection

19:57.024 --> 19:59.560
that I had done last spring.

19:59.561 --> 20:01.531
It's... you know, it's mechanical.

20:01.532 --> 20:05.005
Lead paint disclosure... there is some,

20:05.006 --> 20:07.911
but the roof has seven years left.

20:07.912 --> 20:10.416
Sewer line video came back fine.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.188
So, I mean, the building
is a real fixer-upper,

20:13.189 --> 20:17.530
but it's got good bones, so...

20:17.531 --> 20:19.233
I gotta go back to work.
You want to try and meet up,

20:19.234 --> 20:20.803
like, 4:30, or something?

20:20.804 --> 20:22.239
Sure.

20:22.240 --> 20:23.575
Okay.

20:23.576 --> 20:27.483
Well, thank you for...

20:27.484 --> 20:30.056
the coffee, and I'll
leave you with this.

20:31.893 --> 20:33.129
Okay.

21:11.639 --> 21:12.674
We're out of beer.

21:20.256 --> 21:21.926
Monica's dead.

21:21.927 --> 21:23.629
I know, we were there.

21:25.633 --> 21:27.803
<i>What's the matter, Batman?</i>

21:27.804 --> 21:31.277
<i>No witty comeback? No threat?</i>

21:31.278 --> 21:33.682
<i>Then I'll provide the narration.</i>

21:40.864 --> 21:43.301
What's with the outfit?

21:43.302 --> 21:45.305
School.

21:45.306 --> 21:47.510
<i>I'll begin
with how I peeled back</i>

21:47.511 --> 21:50.315
<i>the layers of the boy's mind.</i>

21:50.316 --> 21:51.851
<i>He bravely tried
to fight it at first.</i>

21:51.852 --> 21:53.288
Is that Monica's stuff?

21:53.289 --> 21:54.423
Yeah.

21:54.424 --> 21:55.994
You're going through her stuff?

21:55.995 --> 21:57.263
<i>You would've been proud</i>

21:57.264 --> 22:00.836
<i>to see him so strong.</i>

22:00.837 --> 22:02.706
<i>But all too soon,</i>

22:02.707 --> 22:07.550
<i>the serums and the
shocks took their toll.</i>

22:07.551 --> 22:09.053
What the hell is this?

22:09.054 --> 22:11.325
Some key to an old apartment.

22:13.796 --> 22:15.968
36 and Racine.

22:25.988 --> 22:28.326
That's that storage place.

22:30.096 --> 22:32.901
36th and Racine.

22:32.902 --> 22:36.441
The shitty one that they stuck
in the old Buick dealership.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.578
Monica had a storage unit?

22:46.395 --> 22:48.064
This is it.

22:48.065 --> 22:49.634
Why don't we just use
the front door, Frank?

22:49.635 --> 22:51.204
Too many cameras out there.

22:51.205 --> 22:52.907
There's only one camera
over the gate here.

23:02.995 --> 23:06.234
The 2884 on the key

23:06.235 --> 23:08.705
must be the code to open the gate.

23:08.706 --> 23:10.742
What the hell is going on, Frank?

23:10.743 --> 23:13.883
Your mother told me she had
something valuable for you kids

23:13.884 --> 23:16.421
but that it might be dangerous
to try to retrieve it.

23:16.422 --> 23:17.556
Well, how dangerous?

23:17.557 --> 23:18.558
Hard to say.

23:18.559 --> 23:20.629
On a scale of one to ten?

23:20.630 --> 23:22.299
Said the DEA could be involved.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.470
The Drug Enforcement Agency?

23:24.471 --> 23:25.473
Come on.

23:27.243 --> 23:28.479
Fuck.

23:30.616 --> 23:32.486
- Debs, how old are you?
- 16.

23:32.487 --> 23:35.425
Too risky, the Feds could
prosecute you as an adult.

23:35.426 --> 23:36.260
Carl?

23:36.261 --> 23:37.463
15.

23:37.464 --> 23:39.901
Really? You seem younger.

23:39.902 --> 23:41.571
Liam, you know your numbers?

23:41.572 --> 23:43.108
You're gonna send Liam?

23:43.109 --> 23:45.412
He won't do serious
time if shit goes down.

23:45.413 --> 23:46.682
Come here. Looky here.

23:49.688 --> 23:52.593
You see that little black
box? It's got numbers on it,

23:52.594 --> 23:53.595
just like on a telephone.

23:53.596 --> 23:56.034
Go punch in 2884.

23:58.572 --> 24:00.542
What're you looking at them for? Go.

24:00.543 --> 24:02.981
- It's okay.
- Go, go, go.

24:19.581 --> 24:20.650
Fuck.

24:26.829 --> 24:28.765
There's got to be something
that you can do.

24:28.766 --> 24:30.435
You can't just let her win.

24:30.436 --> 24:32.439
Kev went to go see that
lawyer you used about suing,

24:32.440 --> 24:34.009
but he said it'll take years.

24:34.010 --> 24:36.347
The Alibi is yours, not Svetlana's.

24:36.348 --> 24:38.051
It's not right.

24:38.052 --> 24:40.322
Where's Carl? Wasn't he coming?

24:40.323 --> 24:41.892
Yeah, I texted him the address.

24:41.893 --> 24:43.728
Isn't she here illegally?

24:43.729 --> 24:45.832
You were never legally
married to the bitch, right?

24:45.833 --> 24:47.836
She was already married to her dad.

24:47.837 --> 24:49.673
Yvon. Wasn't really her dad.

24:49.674 --> 24:52.914
So? Call Immigration on her commie ass.

24:52.915 --> 24:56.621
They'll ship her back to
Mongolia or wherever.

24:56.622 --> 25:00.128
Miss Gallagher? Constance Grace.

25:00.129 --> 25:03.001
I am so sorry for your tragic loss.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.838
W... it's not that tragic.

25:06.976 --> 25:08.177
Why don't we sit and talk?

25:08.178 --> 25:09.982
Can I offer you both some herbal tea?

26:05.192 --> 26:07.897
Get back.
It may be booby-trapped.

26:29.641 --> 26:32.612
Jesus, was she living here?

26:32.613 --> 26:35.218
If she was, she was
living here with a dude.

26:54.591 --> 26:56.093
Holy shit.

26:56.094 --> 26:57.195
What?

27:03.877 --> 27:05.378
Your inheritance.

27:12.660 --> 27:14.396
Have you had a chance to consider

27:14.397 --> 27:16.167
what sort of arrangements
you'd like to make

27:16.168 --> 27:17.435
for your loved one?

27:17.436 --> 27:19.339
Yeah, how do we get her into the ground

27:19.340 --> 27:20.608
as soon as possible?

27:20.609 --> 27:22.445
Are you Jewish?

27:22.446 --> 27:24.016
- No.
- Muslim?

27:24.017 --> 27:26.353
- No.
- Catholic?

27:26.354 --> 27:28.090
Not recently.

27:28.091 --> 27:30.461
We offer memorial packages
for families of all faiths.

27:30.462 --> 27:33.601
Unless you offer something
for narcissistic hedonists,

27:33.602 --> 27:36.975
let's focus on fast and cheap.

27:36.976 --> 27:40.950
This is our most popular
affordable package,

27:40.951 --> 27:42.619
the "Dearly Beloved."

27:42.620 --> 27:44.958
It's all inclusive.
Preparation of the body,

27:44.959 --> 27:47.964
classic series casket, viewing,
grave site preparation,

27:47.965 --> 27:50.101
burial, and a lovely
engraved granite headstone.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.103
How much?

27:51.104 --> 27:54.109
$7,600.

27:54.110 --> 27:56.114
What else you got?

27:57.683 --> 27:59.453
The "Everlasting Love."

27:59.454 --> 28:02.692
Preparation of the body,
no viewing, wooden casket,

28:02.693 --> 28:04.129
engraved granite plaque,

28:04.130 --> 28:06.300
grave site preparation, and burial.

28:06.301 --> 28:08.304
- How much?
- $4,600.

28:08.305 --> 28:09.706
Cheaper.

28:09.707 --> 28:12.279
The "Eternal Peace."

28:12.280 --> 28:14.316
Preparation of the body, cremation,

28:14.317 --> 28:18.124
and a decorative urn for
your loved one's ashes.

28:18.125 --> 28:21.530
- And?
- $2,500.

28:21.531 --> 28:24.403
What can I give
me for $500 or less?

28:24.404 --> 28:27.142
A cardboard refrigerator box
and a gallon of gasoline

28:27.143 --> 28:29.881
in our parking lot out back.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.216
I'll take that one.

28:31.217 --> 28:33.387
No love lost?

28:33.388 --> 28:35.859
It was... an eventful childhood.

28:39.100 --> 28:41.737
Okay, Connie. Connie, no bullshit.

28:43.342 --> 28:44.877
What's the cheapest way
I can get this woman

28:44.878 --> 28:46.547
into the ground?

28:49.053 --> 28:51.056
No embalming, we keep her in the fridge

28:51.057 --> 28:52.993
until we can cremate her and
give you back the ashes

28:52.994 --> 28:55.132
in what is essentially
an old coffee can.

28:56.301 --> 28:57.536
$750.

29:16.207 --> 29:17.842
Hey.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.179
How you doing?

29:19.180 --> 29:20.681
I'm just getting caught up.

29:20.682 --> 29:22.285
I got a little backed-up
after the lunch rush.

29:22.286 --> 29:24.523
No, your mom.

29:24.524 --> 29:25.526
Yeah.

29:26.795 --> 29:28.532
I'm fine. Thanks.

29:34.210 --> 29:36.213
You want to talk or anything after work?

29:36.214 --> 29:38.218
I could stick around for a little bit.

29:41.758 --> 29:43.930
No, I-I should probably just go home.

29:45.632 --> 29:46.901
Okay.

29:46.902 --> 29:48.238
Okay.

30:06.140 --> 30:08.277
No, no, I appreciate that, Dee,

30:08.278 --> 30:10.648
but rescinding her probation
and sending her back to juvie

30:10.649 --> 30:13.288
isn't in anyone's best interest.

30:15.192 --> 30:17.228
No, um, I have a bed for
her and I'll make sure

30:17.229 --> 30:19.232
she's in it for curfew.

30:19.233 --> 30:20.702
Okay. Thanks, Dee. You're a saint.

30:23.408 --> 30:25.011
Doing God's work?

30:25.012 --> 30:26.513
What passes for it
with a sexually abused

30:26.514 --> 30:28.418
trans-gender teen from Iowa.

30:30.088 --> 30:31.591
My mom died.

30:32.593 --> 30:33.595
Shit.

30:35.732 --> 30:37.368
How?

30:37.369 --> 30:40.542
Brain hemorrhage. Last night.

30:43.048 --> 30:44.083
I'm sorry.

30:46.621 --> 30:47.623
Thanks.

30:49.527 --> 30:50.963
I've been texting you the
past couple of days.

30:50.964 --> 30:51.964
Where have you been?

30:54.403 --> 30:55.872
I was with Mickey.

31:03.088 --> 31:06.693
You want to grab a drink
later, maybe get some food?

31:06.694 --> 31:08.731
I can't. I have a date.

31:08.732 --> 31:11.536
One of my kids got caught
stealing a frozen burrito

31:11.537 --> 31:13.607
and a six pack of Red Bulls at the Osco.

31:13.608 --> 31:15.445
It's quite the diet for a 15-year-old.

31:17.917 --> 31:18.919
Hey Trevor?

31:22.927 --> 31:24.764
I'm sorry.

31:27.302 --> 31:30.374
Let me know when your
mom's service is, okay?

31:30.375 --> 31:32.713
She was fucked up, but
I kind of liked her.

31:46.007 --> 31:48.143
Full disclosure, I got,

31:48.144 --> 31:50.081
three tenants who pay
their rent on time,

31:50.082 --> 31:51.918
one who's always late, and
one who doesn't pay his rent

31:51.919 --> 31:53.287
and needs to be evicted.

31:53.288 --> 31:56.393
But assuming you toss the
deadbeat out of five

31:56.394 --> 31:58.564
and rent the unit that
I've been living in,

31:58.565 --> 32:01.269
then you'll have positive
cash flow from the start.

32:01.270 --> 32:03.307
What kind of positive cash flow?

32:03.308 --> 32:04.977
About $1,500 a month and even more

32:04.978 --> 32:07.415
if you throw some paint
on the vacant units

32:07.416 --> 32:09.153
and put in some new carpeting.

32:12.593 --> 32:16.399
So, what do you think?

32:16.400 --> 32:17.635
I still got to talk to the bank.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.006
Yeah, yeah, of course.

32:24.817 --> 32:26.319
Shit, I gotta go.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.190
Some sort of urgent family meeting.

32:28.191 --> 32:30.962
Okay. Hey.

32:30.963 --> 32:32.199
Are we doing this or not?

32:34.870 --> 32:37.041
Yeah. We're doing this.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.044
Okay.

32:45.559 --> 32:47.361
How much?

32:47.362 --> 32:49.165
'Nother pound!

32:49.166 --> 32:51.336
She wasn't lying.

32:51.337 --> 32:54.175
Your mother swore that she
would make sure you kids were

32:54.176 --> 32:55.946
taken care of after she was gone,

32:55.947 --> 32:58.817
and she did it. This is her gift to you.

32:58.818 --> 33:01.423
No way. Nope, it's getting
flushed down the toilet.

33:01.424 --> 33:02.758
Fuck it is!

33:02.759 --> 33:03.827
Hey, hands off!

33:03.828 --> 33:04.829
Give me the meth, Frank!

33:04.830 --> 33:06.466
This is not yours.

33:06.467 --> 33:08.036
- Give it up!
- This is not yours.

33:08.037 --> 33:09.940
- Give me...
- What the hell is going on?

33:09.941 --> 33:13.146
Frank found 7 pounds of meth
in some shitty storage locker

33:13.147 --> 33:14.950
that Monica had and now
he wants to sell it.

33:14.951 --> 33:17.455
It's your mother's
legacy to her children.

33:17.456 --> 33:20.394
It's like a family heirloom, only drugs.

33:20.395 --> 33:21.998
And it's getting flushed
down the toilet!

33:21.999 --> 33:26.139
Nobody flushes $70,000
worth of maternal bequest

33:26.140 --> 33:27.342
down the drain.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.415
Wait, how much?

33:31.985 --> 33:35.190
A pound of high quality methamphetamine,

33:35.191 --> 33:39.934
which this clearly is, worth
ten grand on the street.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.338
If you want to destroy the inheritance

33:42.339 --> 33:43.774
that your mother poured

33:43.775 --> 33:46.046
a lifetime of blood,
sweat, and tears into,

33:46.047 --> 33:47.381
go ahead. You got your pound.

33:47.382 --> 33:48.885
She probably stole it, Frank.

33:48.886 --> 33:51.456
What you do with your
pound is your choice,

33:51.457 --> 33:53.627
but this is not a dictatorship, Fiona.

33:53.628 --> 33:57.034
This is America, and in
America, we like democracy.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.739
Everybody gets a vote.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.711
Give me liberty or give me meth!

34:03.882 --> 34:05.484
We vote.

34:05.485 --> 34:07.588
All Gallaghers in favor of flushing

34:07.589 --> 34:11.496
$70,000 of your future down
the drain, raise your hand.

34:11.496 --> 34:12.732
This is ridiculous.

34:12.733 --> 34:14.034
Come on, raise 'em up

34:14.036 --> 34:16.373
if you want to lose $10,000 each.

34:16.373 --> 34:18.043
Raise 'em up. Come on, put up y...

34:19.513 --> 34:21.750
Lip, Ian?

34:21.751 --> 34:24.389
I don't know, maybe we
should sleep on it,

34:24.389 --> 34:25.792
talk again in the morning?

34:28.731 --> 34:30.868
W... Lip?

34:30.869 --> 34:31.869
What?

34:33.976 --> 34:36.045
Debbie?

34:36.047 --> 34:38.985
$10,000 will go a long
way for child care.

34:38.985 --> 34:40.286
Carl?

34:40.288 --> 34:41.924
Call up one of my corner buddies,

34:41.925 --> 34:43.393
see if they can unload it.

34:43.393 --> 34:44.463
That's my boy.

34:45.632 --> 34:47.234
Liam, come on.

34:47.235 --> 34:50.440
No!

34:50.442 --> 34:53.447
Representative democracy
in action, Fiona,

34:53.447 --> 34:58.056
and I am proud to be a
citizen of Gallagher Nation.

34:58.057 --> 34:59.526
Here you go, Ian.

35:00.695 --> 35:02.199
Lip.

35:04.403 --> 35:05.704
Carl.

35:05.705 --> 35:06.707
Debs.

35:08.478 --> 35:09.779
No, you are not gonna hand

35:09.780 --> 35:11.583
a pound of meth to a six-year-old.

35:11.584 --> 35:14.489
I'll hold onto your share for
safekeeping, little man.

35:14.490 --> 35:18.430
And the last pound goes
to dear old Daddy Frank.

35:18.431 --> 35:21.069
- I am ashamed of all of you.
- Come...

35:21.070 --> 35:23.975
Nobody likes a sore loser, Fiona.

35:23.976 --> 35:25.744
Learning to be gracious
in the face of defeat,

35:25.745 --> 35:26.981
that shows maturity.

35:26.982 --> 35:29.118
So who's hungry? I'm buying.

35:29.119 --> 35:31.089
I could eat.

35:31.090 --> 35:32.525
<i>Open up!</i>

35:32.526 --> 35:34.028
<i>Open this door!</i>

35:34.029 --> 35:35.330
Fuck.

35:35.331 --> 35:36.332
We gotta hide this stash.

35:36.333 --> 35:37.835
Frank! Frank!

35:37.836 --> 35:39.338
They're gonna kick me out of school!

35:39.339 --> 35:40.875
Liam, go! Move! Frank,
I cannot go to jail!

35:40.876 --> 35:43.346
Hold them off while I hide
this in Franny's bed.

35:43.347 --> 35:44.382
What?

35:45.818 --> 35:47.688
<i>Open the door now!</i>

35:50.562 --> 35:52.999
No, Frank, that's not okay.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.337
<i>I know you're in there, Gallaghers!</i>

35:58.110 --> 36:00.347
Where in the hell is he?

36:00.348 --> 36:01.649
Hey, Frank!

36:03.087 --> 36:05.190
<i>What the hell did you do to her?</i>

36:05.191 --> 36:08.530
<i>I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch!</i>

36:12.038 --> 36:14.009
My God!

36:17.482 --> 36:18.985
Okay, wait, wait, wait!

36:22.726 --> 36:24.528
Did... no more!

36:24.529 --> 36:27.401
Okay. Okay.

36:27.402 --> 36:29.138
Who is that?

36:29.139 --> 36:30.308
It's Grandpa Bill.

36:35.151 --> 36:36.686
It was an aneurysm.

36:36.687 --> 36:38.056
The doctor said she didn't suffer.

36:38.057 --> 36:39.692
Bullshit.

36:39.693 --> 36:41.195
She suffered every day of her life

36:41.196 --> 36:42.831
the moment she hooked
up with this shit bird

36:42.832 --> 36:45.504
till the day she died.

36:49.379 --> 36:51.149
When is the funeral?

36:51.150 --> 36:52.785
We're not planning on doing much.

36:52.786 --> 36:56.459
- She's gonna be cremated...
- No.

36:56.460 --> 36:59.398
- No?
- No. We do it right.

36:59.399 --> 37:01.536
My little girl gets a proper burial.

37:01.537 --> 37:02.805
It's what your mother would've wanted.

37:02.806 --> 37:04.675
I'll pay.

37:04.676 --> 37:07.648
I know this ass hash doesn't
have a pot to piss in,

37:07.649 --> 37:09.085
never has.

37:09.086 --> 37:10.821
Doesn't have to be a-a church thing,

37:10.822 --> 37:14.428
just a-a viewing, some nice words.

37:14.429 --> 37:15.598
Okay.

37:22.712 --> 37:24.415
You Army?

37:24.416 --> 37:25.717
Military school, sir.

37:25.718 --> 37:27.187
Haven't chosen a branch of service yet.

37:27.188 --> 37:29.525
Navy is the ticket, son.

37:29.526 --> 37:31.763
I did 40 years, saw the world.

37:31.764 --> 37:33.801
Best goddamn decision I ever made.

37:36.607 --> 37:38.443
That your baby?

37:38.444 --> 37:39.880
Yes, sir. Franny.

37:39.881 --> 37:42.484
How the hell old are you, anyhow?

37:42.485 --> 37:43.553
Um, 16.

37:43.554 --> 37:45.224
Jesus!

37:48.899 --> 37:52.371
Look, I'll be
back bright and early

37:52.372 --> 37:54.675
to go and make the appropriate
arrangements for your mother.

37:54.676 --> 37:57.114
I'd stay here tonight, but I'm
afraid I don't trust myself

37:57.115 --> 37:59.084
not to wake up in the
middle of the night

37:59.085 --> 38:01.289
and decide it is finally
time to take care

38:01.290 --> 38:03.726
of a serious trash problem

38:03.727 --> 38:06.066
that I should have dealt with years ago!

38:10.608 --> 38:11.776
A nice guy.

38:18.123 --> 38:19.123
Where are you going?

38:21.630 --> 38:22.932
Fuck. No, Frank!

38:22.933 --> 38:23.933
Frank!

38:27.342 --> 38:29.445
Fuckin' Frank.

38:29.446 --> 38:30.647
Goddamn it, Frank.

38:30.648 --> 38:31.649
Where is it?

38:31.650 --> 38:33.119
We gotta destroy it, Frank.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.822
- Where the hell is it?
- I hid it.

38:34.823 --> 38:36.192
Where?

38:36.193 --> 38:37.494
You're lucky that it
was just Grandpa Bill.

38:37.495 --> 38:38.863
What if it had been the cops?

38:38.864 --> 38:40.166
- Stop, Frank.
- Give it back.

38:40.167 --> 38:42.371
You tried to hide it in Franny's crib.

38:42.372 --> 38:44.308
Give me the goddamn meth!

38:44.309 --> 38:45.810
Or what?

38:45.811 --> 38:47.314
Get your fucking hands off!

38:47.315 --> 38:48.783
You give it back!

38:48.784 --> 38:50.464
- Get the fuck off her!
- You give it back!

38:54.729 --> 38:55.965
Fuck you!

38:55.966 --> 38:57.434
- Give me that stuff back!
- No!

38:57.435 --> 38:59.405
- It's not yours!
- You're crazy!

39:34.409 --> 39:35.810
What the fuck was that?

39:35.811 --> 39:37.414
It's not yours, Fiona!

39:37.415 --> 39:39.151
What the fuck is wrong with you?

39:39.152 --> 39:40.921
That was your mother's! She
was worried about you,

39:40.922 --> 39:42.858
all of you, she wanted
to leave you something!

39:42.859 --> 39:44.528
- Meth?
- That's all she had!

39:44.529 --> 39:46.065
Jesus.

39:46.066 --> 39:47.267
You don't know anything
about your mother!

39:47.268 --> 39:49.004
She was never here!

39:49.005 --> 39:52.210
She was a beautiful, crazy,
fragile, wonderful woman!

39:52.211 --> 39:53.246
She deserted us!

39:53.247 --> 39:54.548
She loved us!

39:54.549 --> 39:56.452
- That was love?
- Yes! Yes, it is.

39:56.453 --> 39:58.089
Okay, then why did she leave?

39:58.090 --> 39:59.558
You don't know what
you're talking about!

39:59.559 --> 40:01.796
If she loved us so much,
why wasn't she here?

40:01.797 --> 40:03.633
She tried. She always tried!

40:03.634 --> 40:06.238
She wasn't here! She was
never fucking here!

40:06.239 --> 40:08.242
She left!

40:08.243 --> 40:10.580
I was nine!

40:10.581 --> 40:14.088
Nine and taking care of you.

40:14.089 --> 40:17.929
Taking care of all of us.

40:17.930 --> 40:20.834
I was in fourth grade dragging your ass,

40:20.835 --> 40:25.477
passed out, in from the yard so
you wouldn't freeze to death.

40:25.478 --> 40:28.917
Staying up all night with Ian
when he had chicken pox.

40:28.918 --> 40:31.622
I washed Carl's shitty diapers!

40:31.623 --> 40:34.027
I picked lice out of Liam's hair!

40:34.028 --> 40:37.367
And I was here when Debbie
got her first period.

40:37.368 --> 40:40.007
Not Monica. Me.

40:42.111 --> 40:44.115
And never you, you were
too fucking loaded.

40:49.058 --> 40:52.164
She was a junkie and a drunk.

40:52.165 --> 40:53.167
Enough.

40:56.908 --> 40:58.010
She didn't love me.

41:04.522 --> 41:05.825
She didn't love you.

41:08.030 --> 41:11.268
She didn't give a shit
about anyone but herself.

41:11.269 --> 41:13.273
Please.

41:19.219 --> 41:20.521
I'm glad she's dead.

41:23.160 --> 41:25.531
At least now she can't
fuck us over anymore.

41:49.112 --> 41:51.049
She sleeping?

41:55.557 --> 41:58.029
I, found these

41:58.030 --> 42:00.500
with Monica's stuff in the storage unit.

42:00.501 --> 42:04.541
Greeting cards she bought for
our birthdays and holidays.

42:04.542 --> 42:06.346
I guess she never got
around to mailing them.

42:14.228 --> 42:17.500
"Congrats on your retirement."

42:17.501 --> 42:19.404
Only she crossed out "retirement"

42:19.405 --> 42:20.840
and wrote "birthday."

42:20.841 --> 42:22.545
Always thinking of us, right?

42:29.592 --> 42:30.627
Right.

43:39.265 --> 43:40.533
Going for a run?

43:40.534 --> 43:42.036
Yeah, got to stay in shape.

43:42.037 --> 43:44.007
Can I join you?

43:44.008 --> 43:46.011
Free country.

44:00.340 --> 44:02.143
The flowers arrived already,

44:02.144 --> 44:05.149
and the photo blow-up that
your grandfather arranged.

44:05.150 --> 44:07.687
You caught us just in the
nick of time yesterday.

44:07.688 --> 44:09.691
Jose had her halfway in the furnace.

44:09.692 --> 44:12.932
She got a bit singed, but she
was going in feet first,

44:12.933 --> 44:16.306
so no one will be able to
tell with her shoes on.

44:18.210 --> 44:20.513
I... doubt we'll need this many chairs.

44:20.514 --> 44:22.483
A more intimate affair?

44:22.484 --> 44:24.487
More like nobody gives a shit.

44:24.488 --> 44:25.968
I'll have a few removed.

44:29.298 --> 44:30.800
Wow.

44:30.801 --> 44:32.071
She was beautiful.

44:34.542 --> 44:35.912
Yeah, she was.

44:37.748 --> 44:39.184
Would you like me to open the casket

44:39.185 --> 44:40.586
before the guests arrive,

44:40.587 --> 44:42.858
make sure you're satisfied
with the results?

44:44.695 --> 44:45.831
Sure.

44:59.725 --> 45:02.030
Is everything all right?

45:03.733 --> 45:06.538
She's... she's wearing
her wedding dress.

45:06.539 --> 45:08.475
Was that not discussed?

45:08.476 --> 45:09.836
Your father brought it by earlier.

45:12.217 --> 45:15.323
No, Th... that's fine, that's...

45:18.496 --> 45:21.335
In fact, you know what? That's...
that's fucking perfect.

45:21.336 --> 45:23.539
That's perfect, yeah.

45:23.540 --> 45:27.547
She looks lovely, doesn't
she? Like an angel.

45:30.754 --> 45:34.895
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
She's just an angel.

45:34.896 --> 45:37.767
Could I have a few minutes
alone with her, please?

45:37.768 --> 45:39.405
Of course.

46:06.292 --> 46:07.394
Fuck you, Mom.

48:17.020 --> 48:18.088
"Harmony"...

48:21.262 --> 48:22.830
"I must decide."

48:27.774 --> 48:29.744
I don't really know if I know

48:29.745 --> 48:31.781
what that means exactly.

48:31.782 --> 48:36.091
It's in this crazy-ass book
that I found in Monica's stuff,

48:36.092 --> 48:37.761
and she'd underlined that part.

48:42.571 --> 48:44.575
I'm not sure what else to say really.

48:47.147 --> 48:50.486
You couldn't count on her,

48:50.487 --> 48:53.759
but she never had a bad
thing to say about anyone,

48:53.760 --> 48:55.597
and she always had a good time.

48:57.902 --> 48:59.104
And that's something.

49:13.099 --> 49:17.773
No, wa... wa... wait.
W... Moni... Monica...

49:17.774 --> 49:20.779
Come on.

49:20.780 --> 49:24.387
Monica was the love of
my life, and I knew that

49:24.388 --> 49:28.562
the first time I ever saw her.

49:28.563 --> 49:32.336
I was in college, going nowhere, bored.

49:32.337 --> 49:36.010
Summer internships with
State Farm Insurance.

49:36.011 --> 49:40.954
Junior year I was
in the dorm, studying.

49:40.955 --> 49:44.794
Some buddies had a-an
extra concert ticket.

49:44.795 --> 49:48.268
I never really liked
Supertramp, but I went anyway,

49:48.269 --> 49:52.878
and... she jumped into
the window of my car.

49:52.879 --> 49:54.982
She was running from this big dude.

49:54.983 --> 49:56.484
He had a gun, and she was screaming,

49:56.485 --> 49:58.288
"Don't rape me again!"

49:58.289 --> 50:02.196
And I had to loan her
my shirt, 'cause...

50:02.197 --> 50:04.467
she was naked.

50:04.468 --> 50:07.539
And that was it.

50:07.540 --> 50:12.016
My pilot light was out and
Monica was the gas company.

50:12.017 --> 50:15.990
She taught me how to live.
She changed everything.

50:15.991 --> 50:20.098
First time I ever did a line of coke...

50:20.099 --> 50:23.038
was with Monica.

50:23.039 --> 50:26.345
We loved a lot. We fought a lot.

50:33.426 --> 50:35.629
Every time I look into one of...

50:35.630 --> 50:38.601
You kids's faces, I see her
face looking back at me...

50:38.602 --> 50:41.140
Smiling, laughing.

50:41.141 --> 50:42.644
She was strong.

50:44.481 --> 50:45.984
And you're strong.

50:45.985 --> 50:48.422
And she was brave, and you're brave.

50:50.626 --> 50:53.031
I know you didn't think much of her,

50:53.032 --> 50:55.570
but... she loved you.

50:59.044 --> 51:01.080
And you wouldn't be who you are,
and I wouldn't be who I am,

51:01.081 --> 51:02.850
if she hadn't come into our lives.

51:02.851 --> 51:07.292
So, hate her if you want...

51:07.293 --> 51:10.065
but she's in you,

51:10.066 --> 51:11.435
and that's a good thing.

51:18.249 --> 51:20.585
And I miss you, Monnie.

51:20.586 --> 51:22.157
And it's hard as hell.

51:25.496 --> 51:27.499
I love you.

52:03.806 --> 52:06.611
Whoo! Whoo!

52:17.267 --> 52:19.770
Whoo!

52:38.642 --> 52:40.712
What are you doing out here?

52:40.713 --> 52:44.720
Coffee.

52:49.264 --> 52:50.665
Good for you.

52:51.970 --> 52:53.838
Kind of fucked really.

52:53.839 --> 52:55.376
I miss everything about drinking.

52:59.784 --> 53:01.154
Anything you can do about that?

53:05.630 --> 53:08.635
I can sit out here,

53:08.636 --> 53:11.240
drink a gallon of coffee.

53:11.241 --> 53:14.080
Maybe, knit a sweater.

53:16.184 --> 53:17.252
A sweater?

53:17.253 --> 53:19.591
It's a long story.

53:28.742 --> 53:31.347
I really think I fucked it all up.

53:34.754 --> 53:38.094
You know, my life...

53:38.095 --> 53:40.131
my future,

53:40.132 --> 53:42.102
what's left of it.

53:44.541 --> 53:47.813
I want to try to go back to college.

53:47.814 --> 53:49.817
So do.

53:51.421 --> 53:53.392
It's not that easy.

53:55.062 --> 53:57.432
I feel like I'd have to start all over.

53:57.433 --> 54:00.372
So what? You're young, and...

54:02.677 --> 54:04.012
Not that young.

54:04.013 --> 54:05.616
Young enough.

54:07.921 --> 54:11.795
I've got this professor,
think you met him once.

54:14.367 --> 54:18.275
He seems, inexplicably, to
still give a shit about me.

54:21.047 --> 54:24.820
Lot of people still inexplicably
give a shit about you.

54:34.774 --> 54:36.844
Shit.

54:36.845 --> 54:38.314
What?

54:38.315 --> 54:40.986
Frank.

54:42.657 --> 54:44.026
Come here.

54:59.892 --> 55:01.093
Your guy didn't come?

55:01.094 --> 55:04.500
Trevor? No.

55:04.501 --> 55:06.837
Kinda fucked that one up.

55:06.838 --> 55:08.841
Fixable?

55:08.842 --> 55:10.679
I have to see.

55:18.262 --> 55:20.665
I guess the motherfucker really
did love the crazy bitch.

55:23.772 --> 55:25.475
You didn't know that?

55:27.046 --> 55:29.516
Guess I never really
wanted to believe it.

55:41.575 --> 55:43.311
Come on.

55:56.004 --> 55:57.639
All right.

56:24.895 --> 56:25.896
Whoo!

59:26.224 --> 59:28.160
No.

59:28.161 --> 59:30.431
No, that's it.

59:31.204 --> 59:32.941
Look, there is nothing else, all right?

59:34.145 --> 59:36.376
Come back next year. Jesus.

59:36.377 --> 59:38.747
Go.

59:38.748 --> 59:40.017
Go!

59:41.721 --> 59:43.357
Fuck off.
