WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:05.338
Come on, honey.

00:06.256 --> 00:07.924
Take that stand.

00:08.425 --> 00:09.509
Count!

00:09.593 --> 00:13.554
- Ten, nine, eight, seven...
- Ignition.

00:13.639 --> 00:15.056
...six...
- Prepare for lift-off.

00:15.140 --> 00:18.142
- Main-stage.
...five, four, three,

00:18.227 --> 00:20.937
two, one, zero.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.153
And so Voyager II is now a part of history.

00:29.446 --> 00:32.865
Rocketing into space from its launch pad
here at Cape Kennedy

00:32.950 --> 00:36.452
on this historic date, August 20, 1977.

00:36.954 --> 00:40.081
Onboard the space probe
are photographic images of Earth,

00:40.165 --> 00:43.584
verbal greetings
and a medley of musical compositions.

00:44.211 --> 00:48.381
Voyager II is our invitation
to other intelligent species in the universe.

00:48.632 --> 00:51.384
"Please come and visit our planet Earth."

00:56.974 --> 00:59.559
As the Secretary General
of the United Nations,

00:59.643 --> 01:03.271
an organization of 147 member states,

01:03.355 --> 01:08.025
who represent almost all of
the human inhabitants of the planet Earth,

01:08.110 --> 01:12.488
I send greetings on behalf of the people
of our planet.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.760
Hello from the children of planet Earth.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.519
I love you.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.324
Don't do this to yourself, Jenny. Go to sleep.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.539
That's very good, General.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.625
- Mr. Director.
- Yes.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.795
Would you excuse me, please?

05:07.641 --> 05:10.518
- Sounds like Soviet space garbage.
- The MOLINK people say no.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.061
Well, what does the Kremlin say?

05:12.896 --> 05:14.230
They don't know from nothing.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.913
This is Delta Yankee,
two miles and closing, locked on target.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.624
- Permission to launch.
- Permission granted.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.252
Delta Yankee executing launch.
Missiles away.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.176
Interceptor Delta Yankee reports a hit, sir.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.846
No change in speed,
but we've got another alteration of course.

05:46.930 --> 05:47.930
New estimated point of impact,

05:48.015 --> 05:50.766
Northern Wisconsin,
someplace up by Chequamegon Bay.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.812
Get Mark Shermin.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.358
Tony takes a pass,
Murray drives to the left, he blows it.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.777
He's down. No harm, no foul.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.829
Just under three minutes left to play.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.874
Cheeks picks up Johnson at mid-court.
Frank is looking to go to Greeney.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.208
He's been red hot for this pass.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.003
Now he's into the top of the key
and he finds Johnson all alone.

06:19.087 --> 06:22.381
He's up and in for a deuce.
And he was fouled on the play.

06:22.466 --> 06:25.301
Call me back in 20 minutes, will you? I'm...

06:26.053 --> 06:28.429
Yes, sir. Sorry about that.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.643
What?

06:42.027 --> 06:45.946
Chequamegon Bay? Yes, sir.
No, no, no, no problem.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.615
Oh, damn!

12:26.579 --> 12:27.788
Scott?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.600
You're not Scott.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.647
Scott.

13:24.554 --> 13:27.181
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

13:27.265 --> 13:30.893
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.729
"As the Secretary General
of the United Nations

13:33.813 --> 13:36.607
"an organization of 147 member states,

13:36.691 --> 13:40.402
"who represent almost all of
the human inhabitants of the planet Earth,

13:42.197 --> 13:43.614
"I send greetings."

14:29.410 --> 14:31.453
Who is that handsome guy?

14:32.288 --> 14:35.123
- Oh, God, what a day, huh?
- Yeah.

14:53.935 --> 14:58.730
Here she comes, ladies and gentlemen.
Look at that gorgeous car. And off we go.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.660
Don't worry, it's not going to go off
until the hammer's back.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.830
Now, what we want to do

15:16.457 --> 15:18.333
is we want to squeeze

15:19.669 --> 15:21.336
and squeeze.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.173
One more time.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.343
Not bad.

15:29.012 --> 15:32.848
Actually, you should probably, you know,
steady with your other hand here.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.602
You'll get more accuracy,
probably, this way.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.397
Here. Here.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.026
Yeah, come here. Come here.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.113
Don't be afraid.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.785
Don't be afraid.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.579
I mean you no harm.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.545
Oh, this is great.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.506
Yeah.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.810
Boy, what a weird dream.

19:35.258 --> 19:38.009
Who are you? What do you want?

19:44.517 --> 19:46.935
We go.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.322
I can't get the engine started.

20:06.873 --> 20:07.998
Scott?

20:30.813 --> 20:32.147
Where?

20:33.065 --> 20:35.066
Which way? Left, right?

20:55.963 --> 20:57.130
Here.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.426
You know where that place is?

21:06.390 --> 21:10.310
If this is California and down here is

21:10.853 --> 21:14.689
Texas, that must be, like,

21:15.358 --> 21:18.568
- Arizona, maybe.
- Want to be driven.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.196
Arizona maybe.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.391
Ten minutes.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.944
About that time, Mr. Shermin.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.988
- Okay.
- Coffee?

22:03.072 --> 22:04.280
Yeah.

22:09.078 --> 22:12.330
Hey, Sergeant, can you get police bands
on that thing?

22:12.415 --> 22:14.124
No problem. Why?

22:15.167 --> 22:17.502
I'm interested in anything weird.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.963
You know, freaky, bizarre.

23:10.306 --> 23:11.473
- Hi there.
- Hi.

23:11.557 --> 23:15.769
- I'm Major Bell.
- Hi, Mark Shermin. Is it clean?

23:15.853 --> 23:19.272
Well, no radioactivity.
No readings on bacteria.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.691
You attached to National Security?

23:21.776 --> 23:24.360
Not very. I just work for them.

23:24.445 --> 23:28.948
On loan. Sort of like a library book.
No, actually I'm with SETI.

23:29.033 --> 23:30.950
Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

23:31.035 --> 23:33.495
So they're sending you guys out
on meteorites now?

23:33.579 --> 23:36.039
- Only when they change course.
- Change course?

23:36.123 --> 23:38.666
- Can they do that?
- This one did.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.376
So they tell me. Twice.

23:40.795 --> 23:45.673
Either that or some airhead over at NORAD
misread a glitch on his monitor.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.468
It also came down slower
than suborbital speed.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.096
So, naturally, they decided to fire
some missiles at it.

23:54.350 --> 23:57.185
- Hey, what the hell are they doing?
- Trying to take a core sample.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.105
- Nobody authorized that.
- Damn thing sounded hollow to me.

24:00.189 --> 24:02.190
Hollow? There's no such thing as a hollow...

24:07.029 --> 24:08.780
Jesus Christ!

24:09.865 --> 24:11.199
You were about to say?

24:11.700 --> 24:15.203
Up and at 'em, folks, this is station WDLU,
at Madison, Wisconsin,

24:15.287 --> 24:16.913
bringing you the 6:00 a.m. News.

24:16.997 --> 24:20.041
No, folks, all of you that saw that flash
in the sky last night,

24:20.126 --> 24:23.294
it wasn't the end of the world
and it wasn't a burning airliner.

24:23.379 --> 24:26.631
No, sir. According to the A.P. Wire,
one of the biggest meteorites

24:26.715 --> 24:29.425
to strike the planet Earth
in the past 80 years

24:29.510 --> 24:33.346
hit last night near Ashland,
not far from Chequamegon Bay.

24:33.430 --> 24:37.600
So you folks who called in
to say you saw a flying saucer land...

24:41.564 --> 24:43.731
That's about you, isn't it?

24:45.067 --> 24:49.362
You really are some kind of Martian
or something, aren't you?

24:51.824 --> 24:55.618
What do you want here?
What are you doing?

24:57.079 --> 25:00.039
What do you want with me?
Where are you taking me?

25:00.541 --> 25:02.917
Why do you look so much like Scott?

25:04.336 --> 25:06.171
I can't get no

25:07.214 --> 25:09.048
satisfaction

25:09.884 --> 25:11.092
That does it.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.647
Help!

25:25.858 --> 25:29.360
You crazy sons of bitches.
What's the matter with you?

25:29.778 --> 25:30.987
Help!

25:31.071 --> 25:32.280
Help me!

25:32.656 --> 25:34.449
Help me, please.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.451
I'm being kidnapped.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.994
I send greetings.

25:38.412 --> 25:39.829
What the hell's going on here?

25:39.914 --> 25:41.623
I'm being kidnapped.

25:42.750 --> 25:43.791
Greetings.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.879
You'd better let her go, pal.
I'll give you some greetings.

26:25.876 --> 26:27.252
How'd you do that?

26:28.504 --> 26:30.505
Those little gray jobs?

27:04.873 --> 27:06.374
Mr. Shermin!

27:13.048 --> 27:15.550
Communications Central,
this is Project Visitor

27:15.634 --> 27:19.429
at the Chequamegon sighting.
I have Mr. Shermin for you.

27:19.513 --> 27:21.389
The director's on the line.

27:23.434 --> 27:24.726
All right, Shermin, what is it?

27:24.977 --> 27:26.185
I'll know more in a couple of hours.

27:26.270 --> 27:29.397
We're taking it out of here now
and having a lab set up in Madison.

27:29.481 --> 27:33.276
This meteor, the Chequamegon sighting,
appears to be hollow?

27:33.360 --> 27:36.738
No, not "appears to be." It is hollow.

27:38.741 --> 27:41.492
I think the balloon has just gone up, sir.

27:54.798 --> 27:58.343
Do you have to keep that thing
on your lap like that?

27:58.427 --> 28:02.138
Those things...
Guns make me a little bit jumpy.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.932
Define "little bit jumpy."

28:06.226 --> 28:08.353
That's a little bit.

28:09.063 --> 28:13.399
And jumpy's like nervous, afraid.

28:13.984 --> 28:15.610
You know that word "afraid"?

28:15.694 --> 28:17.612
"Afraid." Yes.

28:19.114 --> 28:21.532
How much English do you understand?

28:21.617 --> 28:25.328
I understand greetings
in 54 planet Earth languages.

28:26.163 --> 28:31.334
I understand English language little bit.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.675
Nothing much in there. It's just a lot of junk.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.512
That's my wallet.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.481
That's my driver's license.

28:57.611 --> 29:01.364
That's me. My name, Jenny Hayden.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.907
"Jenny Hayden."

29:04.993 --> 29:07.078
What do you want, anyway?

29:07.162 --> 29:08.704
Why did you come here?

29:11.375 --> 29:12.917
Oh, my God.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.088
I look like Scott.

29:22.386 --> 29:23.678
Yeah, you do.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.350
I look like Scott,

29:30.060 --> 29:33.521
so you do not be little bit jumpy.

30:20.611 --> 30:21.819
Mr. Shermin.

30:25.115 --> 30:28.743
Listen, about those police calls,
you did say anything weird, right?

30:28.827 --> 30:31.329
- Yeah, you got something?
- Yeah, just picked up one from Ashland.

30:31.413 --> 30:32.955
Happened sometime this morning.

30:33.040 --> 30:37.293
A guy name Heinmuller had a collision
with an orange and black '77 Mustang.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.795
Now the gal who was driving claimed
she was being kidnapped.

30:39.880 --> 30:43.966
But when this Heinmuller went to help her,
the guy who was with her, the kidnapper,

30:44.051 --> 30:46.427
yelled, "Greetings,"
and melted his lug wrench.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.388
Yelled, "Greetings,"
and melted his lug wrench?

30:49.473 --> 30:51.265
Weird you want, weird you get.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.975
How do you melt somebody's lug wrench?

30:53.060 --> 30:55.686
Hey, I just copy them down,
I don't explain them.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.022
I don't suppose anybody
got a license number?

30:58.106 --> 31:01.526
Yeah, Wisconsin plates,
Papa X-ray Victor 2-3-7.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.361
We're checking the owner
through DMV now.

31:04.780 --> 31:05.947
Mark!

31:30.264 --> 31:32.139
What the hell is that thing?

31:32.975 --> 31:35.560
Well, it's sort of an invitation, Major.

31:35.644 --> 31:38.479
You remember that package
we sent up with the Voyager probe?

31:39.147 --> 31:41.524
There was a gold anodized disk

31:41.608 --> 31:44.735
with greetings from Earth
in 54 different languages.

31:44.820 --> 31:47.822
Complete with a nice little speech
from Kurt Waldheim,

31:47.906 --> 31:52.535
"To whom it may concern.
Come and see us sometime."

31:56.832 --> 31:58.332
We're coming to a gas station.

31:58.417 --> 32:01.919
- We're gonna need some gas. Okay?
- "Gas"?

32:02.504 --> 32:03.629
Gas.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.258
For the car. Fuel.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.135
Energy.

32:10.178 --> 32:11.846
I step on the gas, the car goes,

32:11.930 --> 32:14.807
I take my foot off the gas, the car stops.
Understand?

32:14.891 --> 32:17.852
No. I do not understand.

32:19.980 --> 32:22.607
How can car need energy so soon?

32:23.233 --> 32:26.485
I don't know.
I'm just telling you, this is the gas gauge.

32:26.570 --> 32:31.198
When that needle gets to E, that's "Empty."
No gas. The car stops. Period.

32:31.992 --> 32:33.034
Okay.

32:33.535 --> 32:34.869
Get gas.

32:53.263 --> 32:55.222
- Here you go.
- Take it easy.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.475
Yeah. Take it easy.

33:02.397 --> 33:03.439
Hi.

33:03.523 --> 33:06.067
- Hi. Fill her up, unleaded.
- Gas.

33:07.235 --> 33:08.486
Gotcha.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.793
Yeah, I know.

33:23.877 --> 33:26.045
I have to go to the bathroom.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.506
The ladies' room. The restroom.

33:31.093 --> 33:34.220
It's when a person has to...

33:35.972 --> 33:39.558
The hell with it,
you figure it out for yourself, I'm going.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.474
"Women." Me.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.188
"Men." You.

34:27.357 --> 34:28.774
Understand?

34:42.164 --> 34:43.748
Can't get her out, huh?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.041
Gas.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.835
Yeah, well, I know just how she feels.

35:10.901 --> 35:13.861
Every goddamn place you go.

35:17.407 --> 35:18.908
Take it easy.

35:21.203 --> 35:22.703
Up yours.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.046
Take it easy.

35:34.883 --> 35:36.467
Up yours.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.731
Hi, let's go.

35:55.987 --> 35:58.239
Nothing of interest in here.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.646
Okay, you wanna sign that for me,
Miss Hayden?

36:59.301 --> 37:01.010
Kidnapped.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.597
What?

37:08.810 --> 37:10.644
What is

37:12.564 --> 37:14.607
"kidnapped"?

37:26.077 --> 37:28.370
You want to know what kidnapped is?

37:29.164 --> 37:32.917
It's being dragged out of your house
in the middle of the night

37:33.001 --> 37:35.419
by some... Whatever you are.

37:35.503 --> 37:38.505
Being forced to drive all night
with a gun pointed in your side

37:38.590 --> 37:40.007
and not knowing where you're going

37:40.091 --> 37:43.093
or what's going to happen to you
when you get there.

37:43.178 --> 37:46.513
So if you're going to shoot me, go ahead.

37:48.266 --> 37:51.977
Because I'd rather be shot
than go on being scared to death.

37:57.567 --> 37:59.026
Go ahead.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.877
I mean you no harm, Jenny Hayden.

38:30.517 --> 38:33.185
Here's OI' Blue Eyes, Francis Albert.

38:53.248 --> 38:56.250
Start spreading the news

38:57.585 --> 39:00.295
I'm leaving today

39:01.423 --> 39:05.134
I want to be a part of it

39:06.094 --> 39:09.388
New York, New York

39:11.933 --> 39:13.559
I am sorry.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.436
I did awaken you.

39:22.986 --> 39:26.488
Do they sing a lot where you live?

39:28.366 --> 39:30.951
Yes. We sing.

39:32.579 --> 39:34.830
Do you ever get hungry?

39:38.293 --> 39:40.169
Empty here?

39:41.463 --> 39:43.797
Like a car needs gas?

39:44.382 --> 39:45.632
Yes.

39:48.511 --> 39:51.346
This body has a terrible emptiness.

39:51.473 --> 39:53.307
This is called "hungry"?

39:53.391 --> 39:57.019
Yeah, and when people get hungry
they have to eat food.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.773
Eat. Yes, we must do that.

40:02.067 --> 40:05.944
We will stop at food station.
You have hungry, too?

40:06.780 --> 40:08.280
I'm starving.

40:09.074 --> 40:10.824
I haven't eaten since...

40:14.788 --> 40:15.913
Oh, my God.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.500
Look out! What are you doing?

40:27.425 --> 40:28.592
Okay?

40:29.135 --> 40:33.305
Okay? Are you crazy?
You almost got us killed.

40:35.058 --> 40:37.559
You said you watched me.
You said you knew the rules!

40:37.644 --> 40:39.103
I do know the rules.

40:39.187 --> 40:42.523
For your information, pal,
that was a yellow light back there.

40:44.984 --> 40:47.194
I watched you very carefully.

40:48.655 --> 40:53.408
Red light, stop. Green light, go.
Yellow light, go very fast.

40:55.912 --> 40:58.914
- You better let me drive.
- I will drive.

41:00.875 --> 41:04.503
Do you seriously expect me
to tell the President

41:05.046 --> 41:07.464
that an alien has landed,

41:07.549 --> 41:12.553
assumed the identity of a dead
housepainter from Madison, Wisconsin,

41:12.637 --> 41:15.848
and is presently out
tooling around the countryside

41:15.932 --> 41:20.394
in a hopped-up
orange and black 1977 Mustang?

41:21.229 --> 41:23.772
We have the following givens. Look.

41:24.524 --> 41:29.361
That man, Scott Hayden, died last April.
He's dead and buried, that's verified.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.655
He has no brothers, no look-alike cousins.

41:31.739 --> 41:34.032
But still, this morning,
at approximately 6:00...

41:34.117 --> 41:37.077
All right, we have been through all of that.

41:37.579 --> 41:40.080
I'm going to ask you now,
how could it happen?

41:40.456 --> 41:42.958
We think it might be
some kind of a cloning deal,

41:43.042 --> 41:46.003
replication of an entire organism
from a single cell.

41:46.087 --> 41:48.422
We found some hairs
from Scott Hayden's head.

41:48.506 --> 41:49.673
But is that possible?

41:49.757 --> 41:53.260
I mean, can you clone a living organism
from the hair of a dead man?

41:53.678 --> 41:55.971
Well, human hair
consists of keratinized cells.

41:56.055 --> 41:59.391
Although, I suppose, in order to determine
whether replication is possible, you have...

41:59.475 --> 42:01.602
Mark, I asked you a question.

42:01.686 --> 42:02.936
You mean us?

42:03.021 --> 42:05.397
- In our present state of technology?
- Yes.

42:06.107 --> 42:08.734
- No.
- Well, what the hell are we talking about?

42:08.818 --> 42:10.736
We're hypothesizing a technology

42:10.820 --> 42:13.572
that's probably 100,000 years ahead of us.

42:13.656 --> 42:15.908
We're the ancients, Mr. Fox.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.035
Ancients?

42:18.119 --> 42:21.371
Technologically, yes. We've just started.

42:22.624 --> 42:24.958
Yeah, but even if you're right,
I still have problems.

42:25.043 --> 42:26.835
I mean, his knowledge of English.

42:27.378 --> 42:29.254
Okay, listen to this.

42:31.758 --> 42:34.009
I helped put this package
together, you know.

42:34.093 --> 42:36.637
This was designed
so that an intelligent species

42:36.721 --> 42:39.056
could get a working knowledge of English.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.724
Enough to get by, anyhow.

42:40.808 --> 42:43.810
A couple-hundred-word vocabulary,
a rough idea of syntax.

42:44.312 --> 42:47.898
Think of what it would mean to talk
to a being from a civilization like that.

42:47.982 --> 42:49.399
Think of what we could learn.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.860
...of 147 member states

42:51.945 --> 42:56.657
who represent almost all
of the human inhabitants of the planet Earth,

42:56.741 --> 42:57.824
I send greetings...

42:57.951 --> 43:01.245
"Greetings," there. See, that's what he said
to Heinmuller out on the road.

43:01.329 --> 43:05.999
It's also what the cannibal said
to the missionary just before he ate him.

43:06.084 --> 43:10.045
Now, well, the question in this case is,
who is the missionary

43:10.129 --> 43:11.672
and who are the cannibals?

43:14.926 --> 43:16.677
When do you have to be there?

43:17.553 --> 43:18.595
What?

43:19.847 --> 43:22.766
In Arizona. When do you have to be there?

43:25.353 --> 43:27.562
Do you see this little star?

43:30.024 --> 43:32.651
Star? What star? Where?

43:35.530 --> 43:36.780
There.

43:39.033 --> 43:40.867
We call that the sun.

43:41.995 --> 43:44.037
When this little...

43:44.998 --> 43:46.707
When the sun

43:47.959 --> 43:52.546
appears mid-sky three more times,
I must be at Arizona.

43:52.630 --> 43:57.050
You mean, 12:00 noon,
three days from now?

43:57.135 --> 43:58.260
Yes.

43:59.220 --> 44:02.055
What happens if you don't get there in time?

44:03.224 --> 44:05.475
Then they will go.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.769
- Without you?
- Yes.

44:09.230 --> 44:10.689
What will you do then?

44:10.773 --> 44:13.525
Then I will die.

44:14.027 --> 44:15.152
Die?

44:22.577 --> 44:23.994
Understand?

44:31.044 --> 44:33.128
You look for food station.

45:08.331 --> 45:09.414
What?

45:12.293 --> 45:13.460
A deer.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.380
A dead deer.

45:17.799 --> 45:19.466
Dead deer, why?

45:20.468 --> 45:24.513
People hunt them to eat for food.

45:26.474 --> 45:28.266
Do deer eat people?

45:28.810 --> 45:30.102
No.

45:30.186 --> 45:32.979
Do people eat people?

45:33.064 --> 45:35.649
No, of course not.
What do you think we are?

45:36.901 --> 45:39.986
I think you are a very primitive species.

45:42.698 --> 45:44.866
What are you, softhearted?

45:45.868 --> 45:47.828
Cry when you saw Bambi?

45:47.912 --> 45:49.871
Define "Bambi."

45:49.956 --> 45:52.624
He doesn't understand.
He's not from around here.

45:53.167 --> 45:55.836
You don't speak any English, huh?

45:59.340 --> 46:01.007
Steer clear of that bozo.

46:01.968 --> 46:03.718
Define "bozo."

46:04.512 --> 46:05.554
Jerk.

46:06.431 --> 46:07.597
Now,

46:08.850 --> 46:11.143
from Denver, here...

46:15.189 --> 46:18.442
It's south on Interstate 25.

46:19.235 --> 46:22.279
Then you pick up I-40 westbound
at Albuquerque.

46:22.363 --> 46:24.281
Hey, will you forget about that deer
for a second?

46:24.365 --> 46:25.449
I'm trying to show you something.

46:25.533 --> 46:30.495
Now, where exactly in Arizona
are you supposed to meet your friends?

46:34.167 --> 46:35.375
Here.

46:36.836 --> 46:38.545
West of Winslow.

46:39.213 --> 46:41.798
I see a little speck on the map, but there's...

46:42.592 --> 46:43.884
Crater?

46:44.552 --> 46:47.804
Is that where you're supposed to meet them?
Where that meteor hit?

46:47.889 --> 46:49.389
Why do you do this?

46:51.893 --> 46:53.268
Well, better safe than sorry.

46:53.352 --> 46:54.853
Just in case something
should happen to me.

46:54.937 --> 46:56.563
Now, there's one more thing.

46:57.690 --> 46:59.483
The credit card, for the gas.

46:59.567 --> 47:03.361
- You know how that worked?
- Why should something happen to you?

47:08.242 --> 47:09.618
Who knows?

47:10.495 --> 47:14.664
The way you drive, traveling with you
could be detrimental to the health. Now...

47:23.508 --> 47:28.178
That's me and Scott on our honeymoon.

47:31.641 --> 47:36.853
A honeymoon is what you call it when

47:39.190 --> 47:45.445
two people first get married and they
go off together after they've fallen in love.

47:46.948 --> 47:48.365
Define "love."

47:53.496 --> 47:55.038
Love is...

47:59.710 --> 48:01.586
It's when you care

48:04.131 --> 48:07.467
more for someone else
than you do for yourself.

48:08.719 --> 48:11.137
But it's not just that, it's...

48:13.474 --> 48:18.270
It's when someone is a part of you.

48:20.106 --> 48:21.648
And when they...

48:25.987 --> 48:27.153
What?

48:30.199 --> 48:31.950
Scott is dead.

48:32.827 --> 48:34.661
He was killed in an accident.

48:38.499 --> 48:43.503
When someone you love dies...

48:45.673 --> 48:46.881
Oh, shit.

48:47.508 --> 48:48.800
Shit.

48:53.431 --> 48:54.848
Define "shit."

48:56.934 --> 49:00.186
Don't say that, that's not a nice word.

49:02.690 --> 49:03.898
Shit.

49:04.942 --> 49:08.528
Don't mind him,
he's just learning to speak English.

49:08.613 --> 49:10.905
Well, he's got a hell of a start on it.

49:10.990 --> 49:13.408
Who's the deviled egg on white toast?

49:13.492 --> 49:14.534
His.

49:15.036 --> 49:17.954
Right. And a superburger.

49:18.623 --> 49:22.417
Two orders of fries, two choc malts

49:22.501 --> 49:25.128
and two Dutch apple pie
with whipped cream.

49:26.339 --> 49:31.551
I had a wedge of it myself. It's terrific. Enjoy.

49:34.013 --> 49:35.472
Well, dig in.

49:38.559 --> 49:42.270
What... Wait. No. No, no.
That's your dessert.

49:43.439 --> 49:45.690
You eat that with a fork.

49:46.525 --> 49:49.694
This thing. Here.

49:49.945 --> 49:51.321
Like this.

49:53.908 --> 49:57.202
No, but you eat that last.

49:57.286 --> 49:59.537
Sandwich first, dessert last.

50:00.790 --> 50:01.915
Why?

50:03.417 --> 50:06.211
I don't know, that's just how it's done.

50:14.887 --> 50:16.596
What's the matter?

50:18.683 --> 50:20.350
Dutch apple pie.

50:21.560 --> 50:22.727
Good?

50:24.939 --> 50:26.523
It's terrific.

50:32.154 --> 50:34.239
For a primitive species, we have our points.

50:34.323 --> 50:39.035
Anybody for Lincoln, Omaha or Chicago,
the bus leaves in five minutes.

50:47.044 --> 50:52.298
Look, I've got to go to the...

50:55.553 --> 50:57.303
I'll be right back.

51:09.567 --> 51:13.278
Excuse me, is there a back way out of here?

51:13.362 --> 51:15.989
Yeah, sure, through the kitchen. But why?

51:18.409 --> 51:20.994
- You know that fellow I came in with?
- Yes.

51:21.662 --> 51:25.165
Could you give these things to him
after the bus leaves?

51:25.249 --> 51:28.752
It's just a map and some car keys
and a credit card.

51:28.836 --> 51:32.881
- You sure, honey?
- Yeah, I'm positive. Thanks.

51:35.509 --> 51:36.926
Hey, honey.

51:37.678 --> 51:39.637
I wouldn't go out
through the back door right now.

51:39.722 --> 51:43.391
That friend of yours,
he's out there in the parking lot.

51:45.811 --> 51:47.061
Thanks.

52:52.127 --> 52:55.046
Excuse me, miss.
You strike me as a meat-eater.

52:55.130 --> 52:57.549
I could fix you up
with a nice haunch of venison.

52:57.633 --> 52:59.968
Maybe even a shot of pork if you could...

53:02.596 --> 53:04.556
Why, that son of a bitch.

53:04.640 --> 53:05.557
No!

53:10.145 --> 53:12.981
Hey, what happened to the goddamn deer?

53:14.275 --> 53:16.609
She went there, to the woods.

53:17.069 --> 53:18.611
Okay, comedian.

53:20.823 --> 53:22.031
Bingo.

53:23.409 --> 53:25.451
Stop it. You leave him alone!

53:25.536 --> 53:27.370
- Butt out, girlie.
- He doesn't understand.

53:27.454 --> 53:30.248
- He's a foreigner and doesn't speak English.
- So what?

53:30.332 --> 53:31.457
Hey!

53:34.295 --> 53:35.503
"Bingo."

54:01.071 --> 54:03.197
Hey, you're losing your engine, boy.

54:10.289 --> 54:12.749
Pick up your garbage and get going.

54:21.967 --> 54:24.802
Oh, Jesus. You okay?

54:24.887 --> 54:29.182
I thought guns make you a little bit jumpy,
Jenny Hayden.

54:29.266 --> 54:31.684
You make me a little bit jumpy.

54:33.562 --> 54:36.731
I thought I told you to stay away
from those bozos.

54:40.194 --> 54:42.862
It's okay. I think I understand.

54:56.377 --> 54:58.503
It looks better that way.

54:58.587 --> 55:00.296
Thank you, Jenny Hayden.

55:05.761 --> 55:08.262
All part of our friendly service.

55:12.226 --> 55:14.143
- You okay, honey?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

55:14.228 --> 55:18.147
Well, I wanted to tell you
that eastbound bus is about to go.

55:18.232 --> 55:20.400
Want me to try to hold it?

55:25.489 --> 55:28.324
No. No, thank you. Never mind.

55:28.409 --> 55:30.743
Thanks, but never mind.

55:31.578 --> 55:32.912
Good luck.

55:46.593 --> 55:49.637
I'm gonna get that bastard, Donnie Bob.
Right now.

55:57.312 --> 55:59.063
- Hey, look out!
- Look out.

56:02.443 --> 56:03.776
Take it easy!

56:03.944 --> 56:05.611
Up yours.

56:06.113 --> 56:07.864
I'm gonna get that son of a bitch.

56:32.347 --> 56:36.100
It's their fault, the Mustang.
Son of a bitch hit me and just took off.

56:36.185 --> 56:37.393
Anybody get his number?

56:37.478 --> 56:42.273
No, but it shouldn't be too hard to pick up.
'77 Mustang, Wisconsin plates on it.

56:51.325 --> 56:54.952
Hey, that Mustang them State boys wanted,
that was orange and black '77,

56:55.037 --> 56:56.329
- with Wisconsin plates?
- Yeah.

56:56.413 --> 56:58.498
Yeah. Well, kick her in the ass,
I think we got the bastard.

57:08.258 --> 57:10.384
Damn it, Sergeant,
we've been here since 6:30 this afternoon.

57:10.469 --> 57:11.469
Now, when can we leave?

57:11.553 --> 57:15.556
As soon as the Federals say so,
and not one damn minute before.

57:26.735 --> 57:28.945
Everybody tells it pretty much the same way.

57:29.029 --> 57:31.114
She had every chance in the world
to get away from him,

57:31.198 --> 57:32.782
but they left together with her driving.

57:32.866 --> 57:35.993
Now, does that sound like any kind
of kidnapping you ever heard of?

57:36.078 --> 57:37.161
Mr. Shermin!

57:37.246 --> 57:40.373
They spotted an orange and black
Mustang, Wisconsin plates

57:40.457 --> 57:43.042
- going west near Big Springs.
- Great.

57:46.547 --> 57:50.716
Scott and I met two winters ago
up at Iron Mountain, ice skating.

57:52.219 --> 57:55.513
I had on this little tight skating outfit.

57:57.558 --> 58:01.602
I was showing off. He kept staring at me.

58:04.106 --> 58:05.189
One thing led to another,

58:05.274 --> 58:08.359
a few months later
we were on our honeymoon.

58:09.695 --> 58:11.445
Honeymoon is nice?

58:12.114 --> 58:14.407
Yeah, ours was beautiful.

58:17.119 --> 58:18.828
Define "beautiful."

58:19.371 --> 58:24.333
Beautiful is better than terrific,

58:25.836 --> 58:28.754
better than Dutch apple pie.

58:30.299 --> 58:31.799
The best.

58:33.260 --> 58:34.635
The best.

58:55.365 --> 58:58.993
Gotta get a couple of hours sleep.
Just a couple, okay?

59:28.106 --> 59:29.148
You're not to approach them.

59:29.233 --> 59:32.109
Keep them under surveillance
till the Feds get there.

59:32.194 --> 59:34.153
But what if they approach us?

59:34.238 --> 59:37.156
If you're in some kind of life-threatening
situation, defend yourselves.

59:37.241 --> 59:39.575
Otherwise, wait for the Feds.

59:39.993 --> 59:41.369
Wait for the Feds.

59:41.662 --> 59:45.414
They get the 6:00 news,
and we get the shit end of the stick.

59:45.499 --> 59:47.250
That's the way it is.

59:47.334 --> 59:50.127
Yeah, well, it doesn't have to be that way.

59:50.212 --> 59:55.299
I got a hunch this might just develop
into a life-threatening situation.

59:56.009 --> 01:00:00.012
Hi. We'd like a room for the night
as far away from this as possible.

01:00:02.975 --> 01:00:05.351
Boy, am I whipped.

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:11.274
My mom always said there wasn't a thing
wrong with the world that a hot bath

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.859
and a good night's sleep couldn't fix.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:20.908
What am I doing?

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:22.910
I must be getting punchy.

01:00:22.995 --> 01:00:26.122
It's just that in that light
you look so much like Scott.

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:29.667
- I wasn't thinking.
- You said the nose is different.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:30.876
What?

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:33.421
You said, "Your nose is different.

01:00:33.505 --> 01:00:35.339
"He broke his twice,

01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:38.634
"and there's something else, I don't know,
something spooky about your eyes."

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:40.553
That's word for word.

01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:43.431
You remember everything you hear
word for word?

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:46.809
Everything I hear, everything I see.
Everything I...

01:00:49.271 --> 01:00:51.564
Everything this body feels.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:00:59.905
The tub.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:02.450
Thirty points apiece
is what the questions will be worth.

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:03.659
So, Jane Nelson, tell us about it.

01:01:03.744 --> 01:01:05.411
Your final category today is...

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:13.419
Believe me, General.
I know what went wrong.

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:15.421
The X-factor wasn't red.

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:04.553
I never knew it could be like this.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:07.348
Nobody ever kissed me the way you do.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:09.183
Nobody?

01:02:09.267 --> 01:02:10.810
No, nobody.

01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:14.980
Not even one?
Out of all the men you've been kissed by?

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:18.609
Well, that'll take some figuring.

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:20.403
How many men you think there've been?

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:22.655
I wouldn't know.
Can't you give me a rough estimate?

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:26.700
Not without an adding machine.
You have your adding machine with you?

01:02:26.827 --> 01:02:28.661
I forgot to bring it.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:31.997
Then I guess you won't find out, will you?

01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:35.167
Hey there, buddy. Are you in there?

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:41.006
Hey, buddy. It's none of my business,

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.259
but if that's your orange Mustang
out in the parking lot,

01:02:43.343 --> 01:02:45.719
there's a couple cops
trying to jigger the lock.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.285
The bastards ran one on us!

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:20.129
Papa Charlie 3.

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:22.965
Suspects in orange Mustang are
headed south on Big Springs' bypass.

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:24.467
We are in pursuit.

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.652
He's got a gun.

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:47.490
No!

01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:58.667
Jenny Hayden?

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.548
Jenny Hayden?

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:12.640
Papa Charlie 3. Papa Charlie 3.

01:04:12.724 --> 01:04:16.435
Suspects on I-80 proceeding northbound.
Still in pursuit.

01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:42.438
I know it sounds impossible,
but I have a couple of people that say

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:45.482
they saw him carrying her out
of the burning wreckage.

01:05:45.567 --> 01:05:47.526
And then they just disappeared
in the smoke.

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:50.863
I've had the police check the entire area
and there are no bodies.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:52.948
Thanks.

01:05:53.033 --> 01:05:56.619
Anyway, I can only assume that they're
still alive and they're probably headed west.

01:05:56.703 --> 01:05:58.829
I'm going down
to Grand Junction, Colorado.

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:03.417
The Army is setting up some kind
of a roadblock on I-70 and I'm going.

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:08.714
Go.

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.419
Hey, Mark!

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:20.340
- You're wanted on the horn. Urgent.
- Okay.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:28.599
Hello? I've probably been cut off. Hello?

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:31.476
Yeah... Hello, I was talking to the police.

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.604
I'm not the police, Mrs. Hayden.

01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:35.939
My name is Mark Shermin,
I'm with National Security.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:38.817
I understand you wanted
to talk to somebody about kidnapping?

01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:43.113
Yeah, that's why I'm calling.
You see, there's been a mistake.

01:10:43.197 --> 01:10:44.489
There hasn't been a kidnapping.

01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.618
We're worried about you, Mrs. Hayden.

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:49.620
I'm fine. Really, I'm fine.

01:10:49.829 --> 01:10:52.789
I just wanted to clear it out.
There hasn't been a kidnapping.

01:10:52.999 --> 01:10:54.833
Where are you talking from?

01:10:55.627 --> 01:10:57.628
I don't know. A truck stop somewhere.

01:10:57.712 --> 01:11:00.047
Can I pick you up?
I really got to ask you some questions.

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.798
- Miss?
- Hold on a second.

01:11:02.383 --> 01:11:03.592
You looking for a fellow?

01:11:03.676 --> 01:11:06.428
About yea tall, red plaid shirt
and kind of nice looking?

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:07.763
Yeah. Have you seen him?

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:11.183
He hitched a ride west with our night cook
about half an hour ago.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:13.060
Thank you, thank you very much.

01:11:13.144 --> 01:11:15.479
Look, I'm hanging up now. I've gotta go.

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:17.940
If you want to talk to me,
you can call me in Madison in a few days.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:20.901
- I'm in the phone book.
- Wait, wait, Mrs. Hayden.

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:25.322
Do you know who or what
you were kidnapped by?

01:11:26.699 --> 01:11:29.034
He doesn't want to hurt anybody.

01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:32.287
Really, can't you just leave him alone?

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:36.500
Hello? Hello? Damn it!

01:11:39.253 --> 01:11:41.338
I need a ride west, fast.

01:11:43.091 --> 01:11:46.343
Hey. I'll take you. Come on, let's go.

01:12:04.195 --> 01:12:05.904
What's your line?

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:08.156
- Line?
- Work.

01:12:08.616 --> 01:12:11.201
What do you do
when you're not hitching rides?

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:13.829
I make maps.

01:12:13.913 --> 01:12:15.455
Make any money?

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.209
I make maps.

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:23.922
You don't get rich cooking, either,
believe me.

01:12:24.424 --> 01:12:27.801
I got a girl, she's getting ready
to go to college this fall.

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:30.554
My wife had to go back nursing
just to help me pay for it.

01:12:30.638 --> 01:12:32.597
Here, you wanna smoke?

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:36.685
Yeah, my little baby.

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:40.022
Says she wants to be a doctor. I don't know.

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:43.358
Costs an arm and a leg
to raise up kids these days.

01:12:43.443 --> 01:12:45.152
An arm and a leg?

01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:48.613
Bread. Geetus. Money. And lots of it.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.125
Hey!

01:13:07.467 --> 01:13:08.967
You all right?

01:13:11.596 --> 01:13:13.555
You're not from around here, are you?

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:35.869
What the John?

01:13:37.497 --> 01:13:39.915
Some kind of roadblock, I guess.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.626
"Roadblock, I guess."

01:13:56.974 --> 01:13:59.768
You got to keep these people in line.
They're starting to slip around the end.

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:01.853
Yes, sir. Sergeant, you heard the man.

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:05.524
Right away, sir. Get in line. Line up.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.698
Move to the right and stay in line.

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:21.706
Stay in line. All you pedestrians, line up.

01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:37.222
Line up. Move to the right and stay in line.

01:14:44.605 --> 01:14:45.856
Oh, no.

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:51.570
You gotta help me, okay?

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:14.634
- Stop him!
- After that car! After him! After that car!

01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:56.384
Thank God! How did you get here?

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:58.887
I hitched a ride with a cook.

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.683
It is good to see you, Jenny Hayden.

01:16:09.357 --> 01:16:11.983
We got to get out of here. Come on.
Come on.

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:13.818
Hey! Hey!

01:16:43.349 --> 01:16:46.101
I've done something wrong, Jenny Hayden?

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:57.529
I wake up alone. You're gone.
Not a word. Nothing.

01:17:00.199 --> 01:17:03.952
You were right.
To be with me is not good for your health.

01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:10.041
You could have at least told me
where you were going, said goodbye.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:13.670
Goodbye?

01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:16.006
Goodbye.

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:21.803
You don't know what...

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:24.180
Teach me this.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:28.727
Well, I don't know. It's a custom.

01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:31.479
It's

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:37.569
how you tell somebody
that you'll miss them,

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:40.488
that you wish them well.

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:44.242
That you hope...

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:48.163
Her tooth coming in.

01:17:53.794 --> 01:17:56.171
Can anyone have babies?

01:17:59.592 --> 01:18:00.967
Just women.

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:06.806
I understand the reproductive process
as you know it.

01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:10.143
As we know it?

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:16.274
You have a baby?

01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:18.818
No.

01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:21.613
No babies.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:26.159
Why not?

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:33.792
Scott and I wanted to have a baby.

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:38.963
It just turned out I couldn't.

01:18:41.342 --> 01:18:45.428
I'm one of those lucky ladies that just

01:18:47.515 --> 01:18:49.307
can't have one.

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:21.089
Here, a blanket! It's dry.

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:53.746
You better get out of those wet clothes.

01:19:55.374 --> 01:19:57.041
Better get warm.

01:19:58.586 --> 01:20:01.171
You know what pneumonia is? No?

01:20:01.255 --> 01:20:04.757
Well, you're gonna find out
unless we get you dry in a hurry.

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:14.976
Here, put this on.

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:32.363
Hi there. Mr. Fox asked me to tell you
he has been delayed getting out of Madison.

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:33.948
- He's going to be late.
- What's going on here?

01:22:34.033 --> 01:22:36.618
Well, according to our best estimates,
speed course and trajectory,

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:39.120
that object was headed for someplace
in Arizona.

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:40.872
And now Intelligence thinks that the visitor

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:42.665
is on his way here
to make some sort of a rendezvous.

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:45.460
Go on inside. Make yourself at home.

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:15.907
Welcome to planet Earth.

01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:44.310
Where are we?

01:23:46.689 --> 01:23:49.273
I think we are coming to Winslow soon.

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:08.459
- Why didn't you wake me?
- I like to watch you sleep.

01:24:11.422 --> 01:24:13.089
I don't know why.

01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:15.800
It's strange.

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:20.138
I think I am becoming a planet Earth person.

01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:24.142
Do you have to go back?

01:24:26.145 --> 01:24:29.313
Isn't there some way you could stay?

01:24:30.482 --> 01:24:32.692
No. I must go back.

01:24:42.035 --> 01:24:45.788
But there is something I must tell you.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.126
I gave you a baby tonight.

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:53.921
No.

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:58.259
That's impossible. I can't have a child.

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:01.721
I've been to a doctor, a couple of them.

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:03.848
Believe what I tell you.

01:25:06.602 --> 01:25:08.019
A boy baby.

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:15.234
He will be human, a baby of your husband,

01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:17.487
but also he will be my baby.

01:25:19.782 --> 01:25:24.869
He will know everything I know and when
he grows to manhood he will be a teacher.

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:34.545
If you do not want this baby,

01:25:35.881 --> 01:25:38.216
tell me now, I will stop it.

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:13.626
Which is your star?
Can you see it from here?

01:26:13.710 --> 01:26:14.919
Why?

01:26:16.463 --> 01:26:19.590
I want to show him
where his father came from.

01:26:28.267 --> 01:26:29.475
There.

01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:32.270
No.

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:35.523
Wait.

01:26:40.112 --> 01:26:43.114
There, low in the sky.

01:26:45.117 --> 01:26:46.325
There.

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:48.870
I see it.

01:26:55.294 --> 01:26:57.628
You'd better get dressed.

01:26:57.713 --> 01:26:59.797
We are coming to Winslow.

01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:05.553
I hope to God we're on the right train.

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:08.973
I don't know,
that looks awful big for Winslow, Arizona.

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:37.668
Oh, no.

01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:42.506
Las Vegas!

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:44.592
What?

01:27:46.678 --> 01:27:49.889
I think we've gone
about 300 miles past Winslow.

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:53.809
We're still going to be okay.

01:27:53.894 --> 01:27:56.604
All we gotta do is rent a car,
and with a little luck

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:59.148
we'll be back there before noon tomorrow.

01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:03.027
Just try not to be too conspicuous, okay?

01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:04.779
Come on.

01:28:10.869 --> 01:28:14.288
Half a million dollars, folks!
Who's gonna take it home?

01:28:14.373 --> 01:28:17.833
Hit the giant jackpot
and your troubles are over!

01:28:17.918 --> 01:28:19.502
Half a million dollars, folks.

01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:22.046
Define "giant jackpot."

01:28:22.172 --> 01:28:24.715
A giant jackpot is a lot of money.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:28.302
Money? Geetus, bread, an arm and a leg?

01:28:28.387 --> 01:28:29.929
Where did you get that?

01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:32.306
We don't have time
to fool around with the slot machines now.

01:28:32.391 --> 01:28:34.809
We gotta find a rent-a-car place and...

01:28:37.104 --> 01:28:38.854
Where's my wallet?

01:28:39.523 --> 01:28:40.898
- My wallet.
- What is wrong?

01:28:40.983 --> 01:28:42.900
Where the hell is my wallet?

01:28:45.404 --> 01:28:46.988
What are we gonna do now?

01:28:47.072 --> 01:28:48.489
Is all right.

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:51.200
But you don't understand.
No credit card, no money, no car.

01:28:51.284 --> 01:28:53.285
No car.
We're never going to get there on time.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:54.495
Is all right.

01:29:02.337 --> 01:29:03.421
Now.

01:29:10.137 --> 01:29:11.303
Damn!

01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:31.407
That's a handy little talent you got there,
but you better spread it around a little.

01:29:31.491 --> 01:29:35.745
These guys get kind of curious
if you hit too many jackpots at once.

01:30:07.986 --> 01:30:11.489
Choppers from the Air Cav
will search the area on a quarter-mile grid.

01:30:11.573 --> 01:30:14.075
- Good, I'm glad you're here.
- What the hell is this about?

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:16.368
You're a man of some scientific attainment.

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:17.745
You mean to tell me you don't recognize

01:30:17.829 --> 01:30:20.081
an emergency autopsy room
when you see one?

01:30:20.165 --> 01:30:21.540
With leather tie straps?

01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:23.876
You behave yourself, Mark.

01:30:25.504 --> 01:30:26.629
Is this your latest update?

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:28.422
According to NORAD,

01:30:28.507 --> 01:30:32.885
his original course and rate of descent
would have taken him here,

01:30:32.969 --> 01:30:35.554
- south of Winslow.
- I see. Anything else?

01:30:35.639 --> 01:30:37.598
The Cobra guys
were asking about ammunition.

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:41.102
Helicopter attack units
will carry live ammo at all times.

01:30:41.186 --> 01:30:43.729
- This is to be considered a combat mission.
- Right.

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:51.278
Listen, Mr. Fox,
I'd like to be a team player and all of that,

01:30:51.363 --> 01:30:53.364
but there's something that I want
to call to your attention.

01:30:53.448 --> 01:30:56.283
If there's one thing I don't need from you,
it's a lecture on morality.

01:30:56.368 --> 01:30:58.536
All right, okay, screw morality.

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.079
What the hell ever happened
to good manners?

01:31:00.163 --> 01:31:01.580
We invited him here.

01:31:01.665 --> 01:31:03.958
- I don't have time for this, Shermin.
- I'm trying to make a point.

01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:05.543
So am I, damn it.

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:09.380
You make a great show of being a rebel,
but the fact is this,

01:31:09.881 --> 01:31:12.550
you are a GS-11 public servant.

01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:15.719
Anytime that becomes
too much of a burden,

01:31:15.804 --> 01:31:20.391
you can go back to Cornell, or wherever
the hell it was that we found you.

01:31:20.475 --> 01:31:23.227
And let's see you make it through
on an instructor's salary.

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:25.563
Now shape up or get out.

01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:27.189
Is that clear?

01:31:27.274 --> 01:31:30.651
Mr. Fox, there's been
a possible sighting in Las Vegas.

01:31:30.735 --> 01:31:32.153
They're probably headed in this direction.

01:31:32.237 --> 01:31:35.573
Well, let's establish a command post
at Winslow.

01:31:37.784 --> 01:31:39.368
You'd better get out there,

01:31:40.203 --> 01:31:43.080
providing of course you still want
to be a member of the team.

01:31:43.582 --> 01:31:44.748
You do, don't you?

01:31:47.586 --> 01:31:49.587
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then get going.

01:31:50.714 --> 01:31:52.882
Get rid of that damn cigar.

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:05.769
We ought to be coming
to the crater anytime now.

01:32:07.272 --> 01:32:09.773
You're gonna make it.
You're gonna go home.

01:32:11.902 --> 01:32:13.652
You want to, don't you?

01:32:14.112 --> 01:32:15.738
Yes, of course.

01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:26.874
What's it like up there?

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:29.376
It is beautiful.

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:32.630
Not like this, but it is beautiful.

01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:37.218
There is only one language.
One law. One people.

01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:42.181
And there is no war, no hunger
and the strong do not victimize the helpless.

01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:47.937
We are very civilized,
but we have lost something, I think.

01:32:49.356 --> 01:32:52.191
You are all so much alive. All so different.

01:32:54.486 --> 01:32:57.988
I will miss the cooks
and the singing and the dancing.

01:32:59.616 --> 01:33:00.866
And the eating.

01:33:17.342 --> 01:33:19.343
And the other things.

01:33:44.244 --> 01:33:46.453
Morning, folks. What'll you have?

01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:48.539
Coffee.

01:33:48.915 --> 01:33:50.582
Dutch apple pie?

01:33:50.667 --> 01:33:54.086
- How about some nice cherry cobbler?
- That'll be fine.

01:33:58.717 --> 01:34:01.844
- And whipped cream.
- Coming right up.

01:34:02.304 --> 01:34:04.305
How long does it take
to get to the crater from here?

01:34:04.389 --> 01:34:07.558
Driving? Not long. Five, six minutes is all.

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.978
I want you to try this cherry cobbler.

01:34:11.062 --> 01:34:14.773
And if you don't like it,
you don't have to pay for it.

01:34:19.571 --> 01:34:20.738
It's delicious.

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:22.489
My wife made it.

01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:24.992
Is very good.

01:34:48.475 --> 01:34:50.225
Do you have somebody?

01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:54.897
A wife-like up there?

01:34:56.691 --> 01:34:57.775
No.

01:34:58.610 --> 01:34:59.777
No?

01:35:02.072 --> 01:35:03.655
I wish...

01:35:04.741 --> 01:35:06.283
I wish...

01:35:07.786 --> 01:35:09.036
What?

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:18.629
Good morning, folks.
Is that your Cadillac outside?

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:19.314
All right, go ahead.

01:36:22.444 --> 01:36:24.027
Yeah, hold it. Yeah, okay.

01:36:33.538 --> 01:36:35.789
I'd like to talk to these people alone.

01:36:35.874 --> 01:36:38.584
- I'll be right outside if you need me.
- All right.

01:36:40.044 --> 01:36:44.506
George Fox just called in on the radio,
said to say they're on their way over.

01:37:03.568 --> 01:37:08.572
I'm Mark Shermin, SETI,
the Search for Extraterrestrial...

01:37:11.784 --> 01:37:14.912
Mrs. Hayden, we talked on the phone.

01:37:15.955 --> 01:37:17.789
This is just such a...

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.628
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:28.967
There's so many questions
that I'd like to ask you,

01:37:29.052 --> 01:37:31.261
I hardly even know where to begin.

01:37:32.555 --> 01:37:34.473
Is there anything I can do for you?

01:37:35.141 --> 01:37:36.600
You can let him go.

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:38.477
I can't.

01:37:39.312 --> 01:37:41.772
Really, I can't. I'm sorry.

01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:43.857
Is it...

01:37:43.942 --> 01:37:46.193
Are you supposed to meet someone here?
Is that it?

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:47.361
Yes.

01:37:47.445 --> 01:37:49.738
You don't understand,
there isn't much time, please.

01:37:49.822 --> 01:37:52.282
Why here? Why the crater?

01:37:54.118 --> 01:37:56.453
Have people from your world
been here before?

01:37:56.829 --> 01:37:58.288
Before, yes.

01:37:58.998 --> 01:38:02.000
We are interested in your species.

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:06.171
You mean you're some kind
of an anthropologist?

01:38:06.256 --> 01:38:08.757
Is that what you're doing here?
Just checking us out?

01:38:08.841 --> 01:38:11.301
You are a strange species,

01:38:12.053 --> 01:38:13.428
not like any other.

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:17.558
And you would be surprised
how many there are.

01:38:17.642 --> 01:38:19.643
Intelligent, but savage.

01:38:23.147 --> 01:38:26.149
Shall I tell you
what I find beautiful about you?

01:38:29.988 --> 01:38:33.490
You are at your very best
when things are worst.

01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:37.327
Let him go, Mr. Shermin, please.

01:38:41.374 --> 01:38:42.916
If he stays here,

01:38:44.043 --> 01:38:45.168
he'll die.

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.174
Can't you see he's dying now?

01:39:00.977 --> 01:39:02.352
Thank you.

01:39:10.862 --> 01:39:12.237
Thank you.

01:39:39.265 --> 01:39:40.849
Wrong ones?

01:39:40.933 --> 01:39:43.268
They sure as hell fit the description.

01:39:43.353 --> 01:39:47.272
No, no.
The guy we're looking for is a lot older.

01:40:11.923 --> 01:40:14.466
Where are they?
What have you done with them?

01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:19.012
- Trooper, where are your prisoners?
- Wrong ones. We had to let them go.

01:40:19.097 --> 01:40:20.430
You what?

01:40:33.152 --> 01:40:35.612
Shermin, you are finished.

01:40:35.697 --> 01:40:38.699
I will have you eviscerated for this.

01:40:38.783 --> 01:40:42.035
Well, as much as I hate
to stoop to symbolism.

01:41:33.588 --> 01:41:35.297
I hear something.

01:41:48.519 --> 01:41:50.187
Give me your hand.

01:43:23.865 --> 01:43:28.577
All units, this is Fox.
I want warning fire only.

01:43:28.661 --> 01:43:30.120
When ready, roger that.

01:43:30.663 --> 01:43:32.247
I copy. Here we go.

01:44:19.545 --> 01:44:24.341
Mrs. Hayden, you and your companion
must stop immediately.

01:44:25.217 --> 01:44:28.261
Stop where you are or we will open fire.

01:44:28.971 --> 01:44:32.057
I repeat, stop where you are.

01:44:32.516 --> 01:44:34.976
We have orders to open fire.

01:44:38.064 --> 01:44:40.774
Last warning, Mrs. Hayden.

01:44:40.858 --> 01:44:44.069
You and your companion
must stop immediately.

01:44:44.153 --> 01:44:46.821
We have orders to open fire.

01:45:13.307 --> 01:45:15.141
Last warning, Mrs. Hayden.

01:45:15.226 --> 01:45:18.937
For your own safety,
you must stop where you are.

01:45:50.886 --> 01:45:52.512
What the hell is that?

01:48:03.978 --> 01:48:05.562
I must go.

01:48:08.065 --> 01:48:09.649
Take me with you.

01:48:09.733 --> 01:48:11.734
- I cannot.
- Please.

01:48:11.819 --> 01:48:15.321
- You will die there.
- I don't think I care.

01:48:15.406 --> 01:48:16.739
I care.

01:48:16.824 --> 01:48:18.032
Now,

01:48:19.410 --> 01:48:23.246
tell me again how to say goodbye.

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:27.750
Kiss me.

01:48:30.296 --> 01:48:32.463
And tell me you love me.

01:48:34.091 --> 01:48:35.550
I love you.

01:48:42.516 --> 01:48:45.268
I'm never going to see you again, am I?

01:48:47.271 --> 01:48:48.354
No.

01:48:53.110 --> 01:48:54.485
I love you.

01:49:05.289 --> 01:49:07.290
Tell the baby about me.

01:49:09.752 --> 01:49:11.002
I will.

01:49:29.104 --> 01:49:31.272
What should I do with this?

01:49:32.107 --> 01:49:33.900
The baby will know.

01:49:39.490 --> 01:49:41.491
Goodbye, Jenny Hayden.

01:49:48.666 --> 01:49:50.083
Goodbye.
