02:23.311 --> 02:24.521
Right.

02:27.607 --> 02:29.066
Left.

02:29.067 --> 02:31.027
Look straight ahead.

02:33.071 --> 02:35.031
Left or right?

02:38.368 --> 02:40.578
Left... I mean right.

02:41.579 --> 02:43.831
Left or right?

02:43.832 --> 02:45.499
Right.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.128
How many tranquillisers are you taking?

02:49.045 --> 02:51.672
I stopped taking them.

02:51.673 --> 02:53.507
So you're sleeping better?

02:53.508 --> 02:56.511
- No more nightmares or migraines?
- That's right.

02:57.804 --> 03:00.180
Do you have a girlfriend at the moment?

03:00.181 --> 03:01.640
No.

03:01.641 --> 03:04.893
What about sexual relations?
Everything OK?

03:04.894 --> 03:06.812
Just fine.

03:06.813 --> 03:08.565
Then everything's great!

03:09.899 --> 03:11.900
So why are you bleeding?

03:11.901 --> 03:13.360
I don't know.

03:13.361 --> 03:16.864
Listen. We've gone over your test results.

03:16.865 --> 03:18.532
You have hearing loss.

03:18.533 --> 03:21.493
Cardiac stress test,
concentration... not good.

03:21.494 --> 03:26.498
I'm not sure we can take responsibility
for sending you back out.

03:26.499 --> 03:28.750
I want to go back.

03:28.751 --> 03:31.713
You'll receive the final decision by post.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.132
Don't take it that way.

03:35.133 --> 03:38.595
Your anxiety, the hallucinations...
It's the after-effects.

03:39.387 --> 03:42.765
What's happening to you
happens to lots of men who come back.

04:08.583 --> 04:11.418
- Let me off here.
- Wait for the next stop.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.546
No. Stop here, please.

04:20.637 --> 04:21.637
Thank you.

04:52.293 --> 04:53.670
Mum?

06:33.644 --> 06:35.312
Where the fuck were you?

06:35.313 --> 06:37.398
- Hey, dude.
- Chill, we're on time.

06:45.114 --> 06:47.699
What's the guy do?

06:47.700 --> 06:49.576
- Who?
- The place we're going.

06:49.577 --> 06:52.579
- No idea. He's Lebanese.
- Lebanese?

06:52.580 --> 06:55.415
- Yeah. You got a problem with it?
- No.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.877
Protecting Arabs will be a nice change.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.796
It's 500 a day.

07:00.797 --> 07:02.798
- It's better than the first gig.
- Yeah.

07:02.799 --> 07:04.716
Nothing to write home about.

07:04.717 --> 07:07.844
- Remember Malta?
- How much did that pay?

07:07.845 --> 07:10.138
800? 800 a day?

07:10.139 --> 07:12.100
Yeah, something like that.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.983
- Is that it here?
- That's it.

07:35.957 --> 07:38.000
Hi. We're the security staff.

08:19.125 --> 08:20.959
You can get ready in here.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.004
I'll let you get changed. I'll be back.

08:24.922 --> 08:28.008
Everything got screwed up last time
cos of him.

08:28.009 --> 08:30.427
What happened?

08:30.428 --> 08:34.140
They fucked up the logistics.
We were stuck out there like idiots.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.893
Who's on your team?

08:37.894 --> 08:39.937
Same guys as last time.

08:41.022 --> 08:44.065
- Michael's the field leader.
- Shit, good luck!

08:44.066 --> 08:45.901
Yeah, he's a real arsehole.

08:45.902 --> 08:47.904
Did anyone get smokes?

08:49.071 --> 08:50.197
No.

08:50.198 --> 08:53.909
What's that ugly tie?
You look like shit in civvies.

08:53.910 --> 08:57.662
Check out Vincent.
He looks like he's getting married.

08:57.663 --> 08:59.873
Gentlemen, if you're ready,
it's time to go.

08:59.874 --> 09:02.584
- Where do we start?
- In the garden?

09:02.585 --> 09:04.754
- Franck and Vincent, you got the house?
- OK.

09:07.089 --> 09:10.051
- Vincent, you get the upstairs?
- Yeah, I'm coming.

09:14.931 --> 09:16.848
<i>Guys, the place is big.</i>

09:16.849 --> 09:19.684
<i>Make sure you check out
every nook and cranny.</i>

09:19.685 --> 09:22.812
<i>I've got five extra men on the grounds.</i>

09:22.813 --> 09:24.565
<i>We'll need them.</i>

09:26.692 --> 09:28.485
<i>Who are they?</i>

09:28.486 --> 09:31.697
<i>Just backup.
We'll be in charge of the house.</i>

09:34.825 --> 09:39.162
<i>Has anyone checked the staff
for new employees?</i>

09:39.163 --> 09:40.748
<i>Yeah.</i>

09:47.171 --> 09:49.757
- Vincent?
- Yeah?

09:50.675 --> 09:53.718
- Vincent!
- Yes, I'm here.

09:53.719 --> 09:56.513
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm in the living room.

09:56.514 --> 09:59.559
<i>The living room with the big sofa?
I don't see you.</i>

10:02.436 --> 10:05.064
- You see me now?
- <i>No, I can't see you. Move.</i>

10:07.984 --> 10:09.734
- Here?
- <i>OK, I see you.</i>

10:09.735 --> 10:12.530
<i>- OK.
- Too many fucking blind spots.</i>

10:15.825 --> 10:17.784
<i>OK. The hallway looks good.</i>

10:17.785 --> 10:19.745
<i>Vincent, you there?</i>

10:22.248 --> 10:23.957
<i>Vincent?</i>

10:23.958 --> 10:26.002
<i>Vincent, can you hear me?</i>

11:51.754 --> 11:53.839
Mummy, what time is it?

11:55.675 --> 11:58.344
What's the big hand for?

12:02.264 --> 12:04.809
I'm on the phone, honey.

13:21.051 --> 13:24.138
Didn't Franck check that?
Come on. It's time for the briefing.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.605
This shit's good.

13:33.606 --> 13:36.483
Come on, guys, let's start. You listening?

13:36.484 --> 13:38.985
You saw the stairs
leading down to the storeroom?

13:38.986 --> 13:41.196
- That'll be our assembly point. OK?
- OK.

13:41.197 --> 13:44.199
The emergency exit route
is through the back.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.075
Left after the courtyard.

13:46.076 --> 13:49.204
Tom, here's the guest list.
You take the main entrance.

13:49.205 --> 13:52.248
- Look, the Prime Minister!
- No, that's the Minister of the Interior.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.833
OK, guys. Radio check.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.043
<i>- Do you copy?</i>
- Copy that.

13:55.044 --> 13:56.295
<i>- Copy.
- Copy.</i>

14:14.104 --> 14:17.315
<i>- How's the front gate?
- People are still coming in.</i>

14:17.316 --> 14:19.693
<i>- You need backup?
- No, it's cool. Kevin's here.</i>

14:20.402 --> 14:22.571
<i>The VIP parking area is almost full.</i>

14:23.697 --> 14:25.406
<i>So what do I do?</i>

14:25.407 --> 14:28.785
<i>Don't forget to save
spaces for the politicians.</i>

14:28.786 --> 14:30.703
<i>Is the minister here yet?</i>

14:30.704 --> 14:32.414
<i>No.</i>

14:39.713 --> 14:42.006
<i>You see the bleached blonde
with the boobs?</i>

14:42.007 --> 14:44.051
<i>- Which one?
- Two o'clock.</i>

14:44.677 --> 14:47.512
<i>You think they're fake?
Is that his wife or daughter?</i>

14:47.513 --> 14:49.514
<i>Knock it off with that crap. Stay focused.</i>

14:49.515 --> 14:50.723
<i>Oh, we are!</i>

14:50.724 --> 14:53.393
Did you hear Duroy's speech?

14:53.394 --> 14:56.230
It was great. Absolutely amazing.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.078
He's sitting right over there.

15:47.865 --> 15:51.035
How do you expect me to pay them
if I haven't been paid?

15:51.619 --> 15:53.494
Excuse me.

15:53.495 --> 15:55.330
Could I have some ice?

15:55.331 --> 15:57.082
- Some what?
- Ice cubes.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.339
You see the villa? Whalid's doing well.

16:04.340 --> 16:06.090
Better than you, for sure.

16:06.091 --> 16:09.510
Yeah, he's made a big pile of cash.
Lebanese style.

16:09.511 --> 16:11.263
Hey, he's French.

16:12.222 --> 16:16.726
Yeah. He might be French.
He'll soon get on Duroy's nerves.

16:16.727 --> 16:18.937
You sure Whalid won't screw us?

16:18.938 --> 16:20.730
- Why?
- I don't know.

16:20.731 --> 16:24.609
If anything leaks about Qatar,
the presidential elections are dead.

16:24.610 --> 16:28.488
Relax. Duroy's Minister of the Interior now.
We can handle shit like this.

16:28.489 --> 16:30.281
Did you see? The polls keep rising.

16:30.282 --> 16:33.242
Yeah, the legislative list looks good.

16:33.243 --> 16:36.497
Our platform is popular.
Duroy's candidacy is imminent.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.634
<i>Vincent, it's Denis.</i>

16:50.511 --> 16:52.720
<i>- Vincent, it's Denis.</i>
- Come in.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.682
<i>Come to the front gate, would you?</i>

16:55.641 --> 16:57.100
What for?

16:57.101 --> 16:59.561
- <i>Hurry up, I need you.</i>
- OK, I'm coming.

18:01.165 --> 18:02.373
Good evening, sir.

18:02.374 --> 18:04.460
- Mr Duroy.
- Hello, Mr Minister.

18:05.544 --> 18:10.632
You can go to the VIP parking area.
It's around the back of the house.

18:11.175 --> 18:13.176
Someone will be waiting for you.

18:13.177 --> 18:15.012
Have a nice evening, sir.

18:26.648 --> 18:29.276
Take the list. I'll be right back.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.667
- Good evening.
- I'm with the minister.

18:46.668 --> 18:49.713
- Your name, please?
- Derradji. Tarik.

18:57.221 --> 18:59.181
Your name isn't on the list.

19:00.349 --> 19:03.227
I'll have to ask you to clear the way.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.817
Yeah. Call me back.

19:10.818 --> 19:13.445
I have a problem
with some moron at the gate.

19:15.239 --> 19:16.532
Clear the way, please.

19:32.714 --> 19:35.092
Yes? I'm right out front.

19:35.801 --> 19:37.928
Yeah, I'll pass you over. It's for you.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.307
Hello?

19:48.647 --> 19:50.440
Fine. Understood.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.111
Go on, it's cool. Go ahead.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.042
Hey, Vincent!

20:10.002 --> 20:12.044
What's wrong with you?

20:12.045 --> 20:13.505
Take this. I'll be back.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.635
You think everyone's been paid?

22:24.636 --> 22:28.473
Our people over there
haven't received their share yet.

22:36.648 --> 22:38.482
Only in the contract clauses.

22:38.483 --> 22:42.820
Our agreement clearly stipulates
that you're paid last,

22:42.821 --> 22:45.573
once all the commissions have been paid.

22:45.574 --> 22:47.325
Which is not the case.

22:47.326 --> 22:51.621
What are you saying? Is this a threat?
I wouldn't advise that.

22:52.706 --> 22:53.999
Change your tone.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.335
Everything all right, sir?

22:57.336 --> 22:59.004
Yes. Wait for me outside.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.673
Of course.

23:29.993 --> 23:32.079
How much did you overhear?

23:32.704 --> 23:34.247
Nothing, sir.

23:35.165 --> 23:37.000
Go and find my wife.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.920
- Go on.
- Of course.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.392
Vincent for Denis.

23:54.393 --> 23:56.769
- <i>What?</i>
- Whalid's looking for his wife. Seen her?

23:56.770 --> 23:59.939
- <i>Vincent, you arsehole, where are you?</i>
- I'm looking for his wife.

23:59.940 --> 24:01.565
<i>- What's she like?</i>
- Blonde.

24:01.566 --> 24:03.442
<i>They're all blonde. What else?</i>

24:03.443 --> 24:08.197
I don't know, a blonde
in a dress with flowers and no back.

24:08.198 --> 24:10.408
<i>Oh, yeah,
I know who you're talking about.</i>

24:10.409 --> 24:11.867
Have you seen her or not?

24:11.868 --> 24:14.621
<i>- I saw her by the pool earlier.</i>
- OK, thanks.

24:18.917 --> 24:21.545
Ghost! Come here. Are you hungry?

24:25.757 --> 24:27.758
Excuse me.

24:27.759 --> 24:29.594
Your husband's looking for you.

24:31.596 --> 24:33.056
All right.

24:41.565 --> 24:45.277
- Did you find her?
- Yes, it's cool. She just left the kitchen.

26:14.366 --> 26:15.825
Here you go.

26:24.876 --> 26:27.045
What's wrong with you? Huh?

26:41.643 --> 26:43.687
Come on.

26:45.313 --> 26:47.774
Come outside with me.

26:49.317 --> 26:50.694
Vince!

26:51.736 --> 26:53.113
Come on.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.286
What's up?

27:00.287 --> 27:03.706
Whalid's leaving for two days.
He needs someone for his family.

27:03.707 --> 27:06.667
3,000 euros a week.
900 euros for two days.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.795
Why are you asking me?

27:09.713 --> 27:11.630
Why ask you?

27:11.631 --> 27:14.341
You need money and you're my pal.

27:14.342 --> 27:16.885
You don't think they'll send me back, huh?

27:16.886 --> 27:18.721
Cut the crap. You'll see.

27:18.722 --> 27:20.432
Why don't you do it yourself?

27:22.225 --> 27:24.393
Make up your mind or I'll ask Franck.

27:24.394 --> 27:26.437
It's baby-sitting, it's nothing.

27:26.438 --> 27:28.814
You chat, play chauffeur,
take them shopping...

27:28.815 --> 27:30.399
- Yeah.
- Take them to the beach...

27:30.400 --> 27:33.193
- I said OK.
- Then you'll stay here?

27:33.194 --> 27:35.614
- I'll be back around noon, is that OK?
- Cool.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.126
Vincent?

28:31.127 --> 28:33.046
- He's over there.
- Thanks.

28:36.841 --> 28:38.425
You're looking good. OK?

28:38.426 --> 28:40.470
- And you?
- Fine.

28:46.559 --> 28:49.020
- You got the Ultram?
- Yeah.

28:50.063 --> 28:52.399
Some Acupan too. It's the same thing.

28:54.609 --> 28:57.277
Go easy on the Rivotril.
Ten drops, no more.

28:57.278 --> 28:59.113
Yeah, I know.

28:59.114 --> 29:02.282
- There's no more Lyrica?
- Nope, I'm out.

29:02.283 --> 29:05.160
Come back tomorrow afternoon.
I'll ask around.

29:05.161 --> 29:08.247
- I can't, I'm working.
- You're working tomorrow?

29:08.248 --> 29:09.833
That's cool.

29:26.391 --> 29:29.977
- <i>Yes?</i>
- Hello. Home security, Vincent Loreau.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.855
- Come in.
- Thank you.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.954
- Here's your room.
- Thank you.

30:09.684 --> 30:11.311
Hello.

30:12.270 --> 30:14.521
Is there anything to eat?

30:14.522 --> 30:18.233
There's some leftover spaghetti
on the stove, if you like.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.694
Thank you.

30:25.116 --> 30:26.743
And you, eat!

30:40.590 --> 30:41.966
Imad!

30:46.763 --> 30:50.349
I'll call you when I get to Geneva.
It's only 48 hours.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.811
That does not reassure me in the least.

30:54.521 --> 30:57.189
Why do you have to go again?

30:57.190 --> 30:59.858
I'll be back in two days.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.902
What's going on?

31:01.903 --> 31:03.863
Don't worry.

31:55.206 --> 31:57.250
Excuse me, I need to lock up.

32:21.774 --> 32:25.068
<i>What I want
is to set France in motion.</i>

32:25.069 --> 32:27.863
<i>And I want to do it
with the support of all,</i>

32:27.864 --> 32:30.782
<i>in a modern country where
people do not occupy factories</i>

32:30.783 --> 32:32.868
<i>or burn cars.</i>

32:32.869 --> 32:36.705
<i>Mr Duroy, there are rumours
concerning your campaign funding</i>

32:36.706 --> 32:38.415
<i>and foreign accounts.</i>

32:38.416 --> 32:41.960
<i>Listen. I understand
that my candidacy might be disturbing.</i>

32:41.961 --> 32:43.962
<i>But we mustn't stoop this low.</i>

32:43.963 --> 32:46.548
<i>I know who's behind these accusations.</i>

32:46.549 --> 32:50.177
<i>But when you've nothing to reproach
yourself with, it can't affect you.</i>

32:50.178 --> 32:52.346
<i>Do you foresee an alliance
with the centre?</i>

32:52.347 --> 32:56.266
<i>Today, right, left, centre...
These political concepts are outdated.</i>

32:56.267 --> 32:59.770
<i>What matters is the desire
to unite the French people.</i>

32:59.771 --> 33:02.481
<i>French people who want to change things</i>

33:02.482 --> 33:05.109
<i>without ideologies
or preconceived notions.</i>

33:45.024 --> 33:46.401
Hello?

33:52.573 --> 33:54.409
Is there a problem?

33:58.162 --> 33:59.705
No. It was a wrong number.

33:59.706 --> 34:02.208
Don't worry, I'm here if anything happens.

34:03.334 --> 34:06.004
- Go on up to bed.
- Mummy!

34:44.458 --> 34:46.418
What's wrong with you?

34:47.378 --> 34:49.172
You hungry?

35:10.777 --> 35:12.652
Sorry to disturb you.

35:12.653 --> 35:14.530
Do you mind if I get some coffee?

35:16.282 --> 35:17.742
Go ahead.

35:22.747 --> 35:24.707
Would you like some?

35:31.964 --> 35:33.716
I'll have a cup.

35:38.721 --> 35:40.306
Thank you.

36:25.768 --> 36:27.562
It's cold, don't you think?

36:31.691 --> 36:33.860
Coffee doesn't keep you up?

36:37.572 --> 36:40.490
I don't sleep much these days anyway.

36:40.491 --> 36:42.368
I wake up every three hours.

36:43.744 --> 36:46.454
In the army, it's two-hour increments.

36:46.455 --> 36:49.417
- You were in the army?
- I still am.

36:50.668 --> 36:52.210
Then what are you doing here?

36:52.211 --> 36:54.881
We always pick up odd jobs
between missions.

36:56.382 --> 36:58.342
Are you going to leave again?

36:59.510 --> 37:01.304
Yes.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.742
Do you hear that?

37:24.744 --> 37:26.370
What?

37:28.789 --> 37:30.749
The birds.

37:30.750 --> 37:33.251
You don't hear them?

37:33.252 --> 37:34.837
No.

37:45.556 --> 37:47.558
Would you like some?

37:50.144 --> 37:52.021
Yeah. Thanks.

38:17.129 --> 38:19.423
I'm going to bed.

38:21.968 --> 38:23.761
Good night.

38:33.562 --> 38:34.814
Come on.

40:12.828 --> 40:14.746
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

40:14.747 --> 40:18.376
We're going to the beach.
We'll wait for you in the car?

40:26.300 --> 40:28.302
<i>What about running for president?</i>

40:29.553 --> 40:34.224
<i>You know, the French people
are weary of speeches.</i>

40:34.225 --> 40:37.769
<i>What they want
is to stand on their own feet.</i>

40:37.770 --> 40:40.730
<i>- They want jobs.</i>
- Go on, get in.

40:40.731 --> 40:42.983
<i>It's time to take radical measures.</i>

40:45.653 --> 40:47.196
You got your seatbelt on?

40:57.331 --> 40:59.082
Turn right onto the road.

40:59.083 --> 41:00.584
Excuse me?

41:01.293 --> 41:03.921
Turn right
at the end of the driveway, please.

43:01.747 --> 43:03.457
What are you doing?

43:11.674 --> 43:12.841
Stop the car!

43:14.218 --> 43:15.636
Stop the car now!

43:23.727 --> 43:25.479
Are you deaf or what?

43:33.487 --> 43:36.240
- Someone was following us.
- Who?

43:47.042 --> 43:48.627
Get out.

43:59.471 --> 44:00.889
Shit.

44:49.855 --> 44:52.149
4-8-8-9.

45:13.712 --> 45:15.506
Come on now.

45:22.262 --> 45:24.056
Go on, run ahead.

46:35.377 --> 46:36.878
Ali!

46:36.879 --> 46:38.922
Leave him alone.

48:58.937 --> 49:00.981
Come on, Ali. We're going home.

49:24.588 --> 49:28.549
What do you want Souad
to make you for dinner tonight?

49:28.550 --> 49:30.718
I don't know.

49:30.719 --> 49:33.305
Would you like pizza?

49:35.307 --> 49:37.309
- Chips?
- No.

49:40.520 --> 49:42.314
Are you tired?

49:57.955 --> 49:59.331
Go on, get in.

50:02.834 --> 50:04.251
- Can you get it?
- Yes.

50:04.252 --> 50:06.296
Fasten your seatbelt. There.

50:39.496 --> 50:41.123
Ali, get down!

50:42.666 --> 50:43.875
No!

51:17.492 --> 51:19.786
Don't move, OK? Look at me. Don't move.

51:24.416 --> 51:25.834
Get down.

52:06.833 --> 52:08.877
She says she doesn't know anything.

52:16.426 --> 52:18.011
I'll take care of him.

52:23.141 --> 52:24.768
Please follow me.

52:26.520 --> 52:28.771
What exactly do you do for Mr Whalid?

52:28.772 --> 52:32.274
I told your partner.
I watch his family when he's gone.

52:32.275 --> 52:34.319
He didn't leave you anything?

52:37.531 --> 52:38.697
No.

52:38.698 --> 52:41.118
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

52:42.661 --> 52:44.996
OK. That'll be all.

52:46.623 --> 52:48.999
There's no statement to sign?

52:49.000 --> 52:50.794
No.

53:09.563 --> 53:12.231
That's all. You can go.

53:12.232 --> 53:15.610
- Can I have my gun?
- No, we'll keep it for now.

53:19.698 --> 53:21.366
OK, come on.

53:23.326 --> 53:26.621
Don't worry. We'll provide surveillance.
You'll be fine.

53:33.712 --> 53:36.006
Why did they question you so much?

53:37.257 --> 53:40.342
- Mummy?
- You OK, sweetheart?

53:40.343 --> 53:43.805
Are you warm?
Want me to open the window?

53:44.472 --> 53:46.599
Let's count the red cars.

53:46.600 --> 53:48.602
Why did they question you so much?

53:50.145 --> 53:53.231
- They were asking about my husband.
- Oh, yeah?

53:54.316 --> 53:57.611
They only asked me questions
about him, too. Strange, huh?

53:58.695 --> 54:00.739
You don't find that strange?

54:05.911 --> 54:08.663
They didn't give a damn
about us being attacked.

54:48.828 --> 54:50.622
No one's answering.

54:56.628 --> 54:58.421
Come on.

55:23.989 --> 55:26.241
Wait for me here.

56:10.285 --> 56:13.330
Souad? Souad!

56:14.998 --> 56:16.875
No one's here.

56:21.546 --> 56:23.965
- Where are Souad and Hassin?
- No idea.

56:25.759 --> 56:27.927
Maybe they let the guys in.

56:28.970 --> 56:31.597
Hello? Yes.

56:31.598 --> 56:33.558
But why?

56:37.562 --> 56:39.147
When?

56:42.025 --> 56:44.401
Is there anything I can do?

56:44.402 --> 56:46.363
How long will they keep him?

56:47.906 --> 56:50.158
OK, but... Yes.

56:51.201 --> 56:52.911
Of course, I'll stay here.

56:54.788 --> 56:56.373
You'll call me back?

57:00.001 --> 57:01.586
Yes.

57:12.889 --> 57:15.432
My husband was arrested
at the Swiss border.

57:15.433 --> 57:17.852
- Who was that?
- His lawyer.

57:18.978 --> 57:20.897
We should go somewhere else.

57:26.152 --> 57:28.321
No, we'll stay here.

57:29.781 --> 57:31.365
It's not a good idea.

57:31.366 --> 57:34.493
I said we're staying here. OK?

57:34.494 --> 57:36.162
The police are coming.

57:39.290 --> 57:41.000
As you wish.

59:15.470 --> 59:18.847
There's a car outside. I'll see who it is.

59:18.848 --> 59:20.058
OK.

01:00:11.067 --> 01:00:12.860
Roc, come here!

01:00:33.047 --> 01:00:35.425
- It's nothing. Just the police.
- OK.

01:01:56.464 --> 01:01:58.591
Ali, wash your hands.

01:01:59.217 --> 01:02:00.843
Ali, right now!

01:02:01.886 --> 01:02:03.346
Come on.

01:02:04.472 --> 01:02:07.600
When your mum says do something,
you do it. OK?

01:02:08.685 --> 01:02:09.894
Use the soap.

01:02:23.032 --> 01:02:24.367
Eat while it's warm.

01:02:25.868 --> 01:02:28.120
I'm not hungry.

01:02:28.121 --> 01:02:30.957
You have to eat.
You'll get weak if you don't.

01:02:48.141 --> 01:02:50.351
My name is Vincent.

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:55.231
I'm Jessie.

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:14.041
What does your husband really do?

01:03:22.967 --> 01:03:26.220
Want me to tell you?
He's an arms dealer.

01:03:27.513 --> 01:03:29.974
He negotiates arms contracts, right?

01:03:33.644 --> 01:03:35.313
Ali, it's time for bed.

01:03:41.402 --> 01:03:44.030
What are the papers you were looking at?

01:03:48.326 --> 01:03:50.787
You have to tell me what's going on.

01:03:51.746 --> 01:03:55.041
Otherwise I can't help you.
Do you understand? Look at me.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.962
I want to help you, that's all.

01:04:01.547 --> 01:04:03.341
Go and get them.

01:04:27.782 --> 01:04:29.408
Stop poring over them.

01:04:30.201 --> 01:04:32.203
You won't understand anyway.

01:04:36.457 --> 01:04:38.918
You think it's too complicated for me?

01:04:42.588 --> 01:04:44.841
Don't look at me like that.

01:04:49.595 --> 01:04:51.138
You think I'm stupid?

01:04:56.894 --> 01:04:59.272
Your husband put you in deep shit.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.276
- I don't get involved in his business.
- No.

01:05:04.277 --> 01:05:06.445
But you make the most of it, all the same.

01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:10.490
Do you make the most of it or not?

01:05:10.491 --> 01:05:12.034
What's wrong?

01:05:14.453 --> 01:05:16.371
You're afraid of me?

01:05:16.372 --> 01:05:18.456
I'm the one who frightens you?

01:05:18.457 --> 01:05:20.251
Answer me.

01:05:50.323 --> 01:05:52.616
It's OK.

01:05:52.617 --> 01:05:54.493
I said it's OK.

01:06:27.443 --> 01:06:30.738
- Do you need anything?
- No, thanks. I'm fine.

01:06:32.490 --> 01:06:33.741
OK.

01:06:34.742 --> 01:06:36.327
Excuse me...

01:06:37.745 --> 01:06:39.705
Yes?

01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:44.794
If things go wrong,
do you have anywhere to go?

01:06:46.504 --> 01:06:48.255
Family? Friends?

01:06:49.131 --> 01:06:50.675
No.

01:06:52.468 --> 01:06:55.179
Don't tell me you only have your husband.

01:07:02.103 --> 01:07:05.981
- I have a girlfriend in Canada, but...
- But what?

01:07:05.982 --> 01:07:08.401
All you need's a plane ticket.

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.488
What are you doing here?

01:07:13.489 --> 01:07:16.116
- Shouldn't you be in bed?
- I can't sleep.

01:07:16.117 --> 01:07:18.035
Let's go.

01:07:21.163 --> 01:07:22.832
Think of nice things.

01:07:23.749 --> 01:07:26.961
Like, maybe you could
imagine a big lake?

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.548
You're swimming happily.

01:08:30.066 --> 01:08:32.068
Have you ever been to Canada?

01:08:35.446 --> 01:08:37.865
No, I've never been. And you?

01:08:41.786 --> 01:08:44.037
I think you'd like it.

01:08:45.581 --> 01:08:48.542
- Why do you say that?
- I don't know.

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:51.252
I can picture you there.

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:53.837
Not in the cities, in the nature.

01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:56.133
It's big. There are lots of lakes.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.389
I can see you hunting bears.

01:09:06.852 --> 01:09:08.645
It's true.

01:09:16.112 --> 01:09:17.904
I'm sorry.

01:10:49.788 --> 01:10:52.081
<i>What did you say the name was?</i>

01:10:52.082 --> 01:10:53.459
Imad Whalid.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.086
<i>Please hold.</i>

01:11:01.926 --> 01:11:03.384
<i>Hello?</i>

01:11:03.385 --> 01:11:05.720
I'm calling about Mrs Whalid's
police protection.

01:11:05.721 --> 01:11:07.847
We were with you this afternoon.

01:11:07.848 --> 01:11:09.432
<i>Yes, my partner told me.</i>

01:11:09.433 --> 01:11:12.937
<i>But what's this about protection?
The report doesn't say anything.</i>

01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:17.316
What do you mean? There was
a car outside the house. It just left.

01:11:18.817 --> 01:11:20.444
<i>Hang on.</i>

01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:24.781
<i>Her protection was removed.</i>

01:11:24.782 --> 01:11:26.367
When?

01:11:27.368 --> 01:11:30.412
<i>I can't tell you anything else.
Those were our orders.</i>

01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:34.375
<i>Hello?</i>

01:11:37.169 --> 01:11:38.754
<i>Hello?</i>

01:11:45.678 --> 01:11:47.554
Your protection was called off.

01:12:31.807 --> 01:12:34.517
- Hey, Denis, it's me.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

01:12:34.518 --> 01:12:36.227
I need you.

01:12:36.228 --> 01:12:38.022
<i>What's wrong? You sound funny.</i>

01:12:39.398 --> 01:12:42.567
- I'm telling you, I need you. It's serious.
- <i>Why?</i>

01:12:42.568 --> 01:12:44.360
Can you come over right now?

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:46.739
- <i>What's going on?</i>
- I'll explain later, OK?

01:13:22.024 --> 01:13:23.233
Yeah?

01:13:27.738 --> 01:13:30.281
You're sure no one was out there?

01:13:30.282 --> 01:13:32.743
- You got a good look?
- I said yes.

01:13:39.083 --> 01:13:40.667
This is Denis.

01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:43.711
- Hello, I'm Jessie.
- Hello.

01:13:43.712 --> 01:13:45.547
Have a seat.

01:13:54.014 --> 01:13:55.057
What's your name?

01:13:56.392 --> 01:13:58.976
- His name is Ali.
- Ali? Hi, Ali.

01:13:58.977 --> 01:14:01.438
I'm Denis. You want something to drink?

01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:05.109
I've got Coke, orange juice, water...

01:14:06.068 --> 01:14:07.653
Whisky?

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:11.323
Here, eat your cornflakes.

01:14:13.826 --> 01:14:16.077
- That's not my usual cereal.
- What?

01:14:16.078 --> 01:14:17.787
That's not my usual cereal.

01:14:17.788 --> 01:14:19.997
That's all there is. It'll have to do.

01:14:19.998 --> 01:14:22.792
You want something else, sweetie?
Some toast?

01:14:22.793 --> 01:14:24.836
You eat what there is!

01:14:24.837 --> 01:14:27.588
- You hear me?
- That's enough.

01:14:27.589 --> 01:14:29.550
Don't talk to him like that.

01:14:38.892 --> 01:14:40.936
What's the deal with her?

01:14:44.857 --> 01:14:46.524
She said she wants to stay here.

01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:49.485
You keep saying the same thing.
What do you care?

01:14:49.486 --> 01:14:52.822
You think people leave
papers like that lying around?

01:14:52.823 --> 01:14:54.700
You need to get a grip.

01:14:56.952 --> 01:14:59.121
Go and get some fresh air.

01:15:56.345 --> 01:15:58.305
Please open the door.

01:16:49.356 --> 01:16:51.066
We have to get out of here.

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.777
Trust me.

01:18:12.022 --> 01:18:14.900
Could you take us to the airport
tomorrow morning?

01:18:15.859 --> 01:18:19.655
She's going to see a friend in Canada.
I thought I might go with them.

01:18:20.947 --> 01:18:23.992
- You're going with them?
- Yeah, why not?

01:18:25.285 --> 01:18:27.287
What'll you do over there?

01:18:29.247 --> 01:18:31.333
Take care of her and the boy.

01:18:32.793 --> 01:18:34.877
You?

01:18:34.878 --> 01:18:36.922
What's so strange about that?

01:18:37.923 --> 01:18:40.676
I don't know. Did she ask you to go?

01:18:43.095 --> 01:18:44.930
I don't know.

01:18:46.014 --> 01:18:47.848
Did she ask you or not?

01:18:47.849 --> 01:18:49.726
I said, I don't know.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.418
We were in Afghanistan together.

01:19:57.419 --> 01:20:00.087
I came back sooner cos I was wounded.

01:20:00.088 --> 01:20:02.256
We grew up in the same neighbourhood.

01:20:02.257 --> 01:20:04.383
Then you know him well.

01:20:04.384 --> 01:20:06.218
Yeah, I know him well.

01:20:06.219 --> 01:20:08.554
What's wrong with him?

01:20:08.555 --> 01:20:12.184
What's wrong with him?
Coming back isn't easy, you know.

01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:15.270
You're not the same as before.

01:20:16.688 --> 01:20:18.482
What do you mean?

01:20:19.524 --> 01:20:22.067
In his head, he's still over there.

01:20:22.068 --> 01:20:24.905
- I see.
- That's the way it is.

01:20:27.491 --> 01:20:30.701
What about you? You're American?

01:20:30.702 --> 01:20:33.662
- No. German.
- German?

01:20:33.663 --> 01:20:37.250
- No big deal, it could happen to anyone.
- Thanks a lot!

01:20:38.835 --> 01:20:40.836
You don't have an accent.

01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:42.672
Sure I do, a little.

01:20:43.715 --> 01:20:45.300
Barely.

01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:49.554
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:20:52.307 --> 01:20:55.935
- So you're German?
- Yep. Hasn't changed.

01:20:55.936 --> 01:20:59.188
- And you speak German?
- Sometimes.

01:20:59.189 --> 01:21:01.232
- Fluently?
- Yes.

01:21:01.233 --> 01:21:03.484
That's wonderful.

01:21:03.485 --> 01:21:05.654
I know how to say...

01:21:07.405 --> 01:21:09.698
Of course, what else?

01:21:09.699 --> 01:21:11.743
You're so lame.

01:21:17.415 --> 01:21:19.875
Jessie is short for Jessica?

01:21:19.876 --> 01:21:22.336
Yes. Jessie is short for Jessica.

01:21:22.337 --> 01:21:24.297
I've got something for you.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:28.385
Now what?

01:21:35.267 --> 01:21:37.644
- You know this song?
- Nope.

01:21:39.354 --> 01:21:41.147
- You like it?
- Very much.

01:21:58.290 --> 01:22:00.625
- It's cool.
- Oh, yeah, you like it?

01:22:07.674 --> 01:22:09.633
That's enough.

01:22:09.634 --> 01:22:11.386
No way!

01:22:19.853 --> 01:22:21.771
OK, stop it. That's enough.

01:22:29.446 --> 01:22:31.406
I'm a dickhead?

01:22:37.078 --> 01:22:39.580
- Am I a dickhead?
- No.

01:22:39.581 --> 01:22:41.625
Go and see if the kid is sleeping.

01:22:43.168 --> 01:22:44.710
Go on.

01:22:44.711 --> 01:22:46.922
I think I'll see if the kid is sleeping.

01:23:13.865 --> 01:23:16.116
Stay here.

01:23:16.117 --> 01:23:17.994
Stay with me.

01:23:18.995 --> 01:23:20.163
Follow me.

01:23:23.416 --> 01:23:26.335
- Are you with the kid?
- <i>I don't know where he went.</i>

01:23:26.336 --> 01:23:29.297
Stay upstairs. I'll call you
when I have the cameras.

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:27.062
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- It's me. Someone's in the office.

01:24:27.063 --> 01:24:29.440
- Ali!
- Stay here!

01:24:29.441 --> 01:24:31.984
Look at me. Calm down.

01:24:31.985 --> 01:24:34.653
Here, it's loaded. Hold it with two hands.

01:24:34.654 --> 01:24:37.364
If anyone comes,
you shoot without thinking.

01:24:37.365 --> 01:24:39.783
I'll get Ali and come back.

01:24:39.784 --> 01:24:41.828
Lock the door, OK?

01:24:42.662 --> 01:24:44.247
OK.

01:26:13.211 --> 01:26:15.129
- Go back inside.
- What's going on?

01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:16.672
- Go back inside.
- What?

01:26:16.673 --> 01:26:18.049
Get inside!

01:26:19.884 --> 01:26:21.928
Stay in there.

01:26:30.979 --> 01:26:34.190
<i>This is Denis, please leave a message.</i>

01:27:54.103 --> 01:27:55.480
Ali!

01:27:59.817 --> 01:28:01.486
Ali, it's me.

01:28:02.528 --> 01:28:04.821
Come here.

01:28:04.822 --> 01:28:06.866
Come on, hold on tight.

01:28:20.922 --> 01:28:22.715
Hang on.

01:28:41.859 --> 01:28:44.362
Look at me. You stay right here.

01:29:34.454 --> 01:29:36.873
Come here, hold on tight.

01:29:38.624 --> 01:29:40.335
Hey, come on.

01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:48.217
Everything will be fine.

01:29:57.894 --> 01:29:59.687
Everything's clear.

01:30:05.735 --> 01:30:07.653
You stay here, OK?

01:32:56.322 --> 01:32:57.907
Hey, Vincent.

01:33:00.117 --> 01:33:02.537
We gotta go. There's no time to waste.

01:33:05.456 --> 01:33:08.333
It's OK. Take them to the airport.

01:33:08.334 --> 01:33:10.253
You're not coming?

01:33:12.338 --> 01:33:13.923
OK.

01:33:18.594 --> 01:33:20.595
I'll put your bag in the boot.

01:33:20.596 --> 01:33:22.764
Where's Vincent?

01:33:22.765 --> 01:33:25.393
- He's not coming with us?
- No, he's not.

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:28.688
Come on, it's time to go. Grab your bag.

01:34:04.724 --> 01:34:06.601
Vincent.
