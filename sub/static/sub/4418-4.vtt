FOR FOOTBALL PRACTICE.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.005
HIYA SPARKY.

00:40.007 --> 00:40.639
WHO'S THAT?

00:40.641 --> 00:41.840
THAT'S MY NEW
DOG SPARKY.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.375
HE FOLLOWED ME
TO THE BUS STOP.

00:43.377 --> 00:43.942
WOW, COOL!

00:43.944 --> 00:45.778
GOOD BOY SPARKY,
WHO'S MY BEST BUDDY?

00:45.780 --> 00:47.646
WHO'S MY BUDDY...
WHO'S MY BUDDY?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.715
YOU'RE MAKING ME
SICK, DUDE!

00:49.717 --> 00:51.417
HE'S PART DOBERMAN
AND PART WOLF.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.052
HE'S THE TOUGHEST DOG
ON THE MOUNTAIN.

00:53.054 --> 00:55.521
NO WAY, EVERYBODY
KNOWS THAT SYLVESTER

00:55.523 --> 00:57.856
IS THE TOUGHEST DOG
IN SOUTH PARK.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.825
GRRR!

00:59.827 --> 01:01.827
HE'S NOT MEANER
THAN SPARKY!

01:01.829 --> 01:03.562
OH YEAH,
LET'S SEE.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.563
HEY SYLVESTER!

01:04.565 --> 01:05.698
SPARKY WILL
KICK HIS ASS!

01:05.700 --> 01:07.766
I'LL PUT A DOLLAR
ON SYLVESTER.

01:07.768 --> 01:08.467
YOU'RE ON,
DUDE!

01:08.469 --> 01:11.637
THAT'S IT SPARKY,
KICK HIS ASS!

01:14.709 --> 01:17.276
HMM, HE'S DOING
<i>SOMETHING</i> TO HIS ASS.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.544
HE'S NOT KICKING
HIS ASS,

01:18.546 --> 01:21.246
BUT HE'S DEFINITELY DOING
SOMETHING TO HIS ASS.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.048
SPARKY, BAD DOG!

01:23.050 --> 01:24.516
( mumbling )

01:24.518 --> 01:25.050
WHAT?!

01:25.052 --> 01:26.952
DUDE, I THINK
YOUR DOG IS GAY.

01:26.954 --> 01:27.686
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:27.688 --> 01:29.788
THAT DOG IS
A GAY, HOMOSEXUAL.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.491
HE'S JUST CONFUSED.

01:32.493 --> 01:33.559
I THINK
THE<i> OTHER</i> DOG'S

01:33.561 --> 01:34.860
THE ONE THAT'S
CONFUSED.

01:34.862 --> 01:35.694
( mumbling )

01:35.696 --> 01:37.062
SICK, SHUT UP DUDE!

01:37.064 --> 01:39.998
STAN'S DOG'S
A HOMO!

01:40.000 --> 01:42.267
STAN'S DOG'S A HOMO!

01:43.137 --> 01:43.936
( chef )
OKAY CHILDREN,

01:43.938 --> 01:46.505
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL EXTREMELY
EXCITED AND NERVOUS

01:46.507 --> 01:48.841
AND ANXIOUS ABOUT
THE HOMECOMING GAME

01:48.843 --> 01:50.409
AGAINST MIDDLE PARK.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.143
WHO'S MIDDLE PARK?

01:51.145 --> 01:51.877
WHAT'S
HOMECOMING?

01:51.879 --> 01:53.545
BUT JUST REMEMBER
WHAT I TAUGHT YOU--

01:53.547 --> 01:55.614
THAT FOOTBALL
IS LIKE MAKING LOVE

01:55.616 --> 01:58.250
TO A REALLY
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

01:58.252 --> 02:01.019
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS SCORE,
BUT WHEN YOU DO,

02:01.021 --> 02:03.288
IT MAKES ALL THE TRY
WORTHWHILE.

02:03.290 --> 02:06.825
NOW LET'S
START PRACTICE.

02:07.328 --> 02:08.293
MR. CHEF, SIR?

02:08.295 --> 02:09.495
YES PIP,
WHAT IS IT?

02:09.497 --> 02:11.396
I STILL DON'T
HAVE A HELMET.

02:11.398 --> 02:11.964
I KNOW PIP,

02:11.966 --> 02:13.766
THE SCHOOL CAN'T AFFORD
HELMETS FOR EVERYBODY.

02:13.768 --> 02:15.667
YES, BUT COULDN'T
WE ROTATE?

02:15.669 --> 02:17.169
WHO DOESN'T HAVE
A HELMET EVERY WEEK?

02:17.171 --> 02:18.637
DOES IT ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE ME?

02:18.639 --> 02:21.206
YES PIP,
I'M AFRAID IT DOES.

02:21.208 --> 02:22.241
OH.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.041
SORRY SON.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.476
NOW GET YOUR ASS
IN THERE!

02:24.478 --> 02:26.812
HUT, HUT, HUT, HUT, HUT.

02:26.814 --> 02:30.115
HUT, HUT, HUT,
HUT, HUT, HUT...

02:30.117 --> 02:32.151
HIKE THE DAMN BALL!

02:34.054 --> 02:34.553
AHH!

02:34.555 --> 02:36.855
HEY, HOW'S PRACTICE
COMING THERE CHEF?

02:36.857 --> 02:38.724
HUH... OH,
FINE, FINE.

02:38.726 --> 02:39.925
I DON'T HAVE TO
REMIND YOU

02:39.927 --> 02:41.627
JUST HOW IMPORTANT
THIS GAME IS

02:41.629 --> 02:43.128
TO US SOUTH PARK ALUMNI.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.363
<i>ELEMENTARY</i> SCHOOL
ALUMNI?

02:44.365 --> 02:46.365
THAT'S AS FAR AS
MOST OF US GOT.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.299
YOU THINK
WE HAVE A SHOT

02:47.301 --> 02:49.802
AT BEATING THE SPREAD
AGAINST MIDDLE PARK
THIS YEAR?

02:49.804 --> 02:52.070
I DON'T KNOW,
WHAT'S THE SPREAD?

02:52.072 --> 02:54.373
MIDDLE PARK
BY 70 POINTS.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.374
HMM...

02:55.376 --> 02:57.976
I GOT IT!
I GOT IT!

02:57.978 --> 02:59.278
I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE A CHANCE.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.314
NONSENSE, NOT WITH
MY NEPHEW A QUARTERBACK.

03:02.316 --> 03:03.715
RIGHT STANLEY?

03:03.717 --> 03:05.717
HUH?

03:09.190 --> 03:10.022
THAT-A-BOY!

03:10.024 --> 03:11.523
GREAT PASS,
STAN!

03:11.525 --> 03:12.057
COME ON NED,

03:12.059 --> 03:14.259
WE GOT TO GET OUR
ASSES TO THE BOOKIE!

03:15.462 --> 03:17.663
OKAY, THAT WAS
GOOD PRACTICE CHILDREN.

03:17.665 --> 03:20.199
WE'LL SEE YOU HERE
AGAIN TOMORROW.

03:20.201 --> 03:21.333
HEY STAN, ISN'T
THAT YOUR DOG?

03:21.335 --> 03:24.403
YEAH, HE MUST HAVE FOLLOWED
ME TO FOOTBALL PRACTICE.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.038
YOU SEE,
HE IS SMART.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.506
UH, MY DOG REX
FOLLOWS ME

03:27.508 --> 03:29.141
TO FOOTBALL PRACTICE
ALL THE TIME.

03:29.143 --> 03:32.044
YEAH, BUT MY DOG FOUND
HIS OWN WAY HERE.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.745
THAT MAKES
HIM SMARTER.

03:33.747 --> 03:34.980
SPARKY, GET DOWN!

03:34.982 --> 03:37.316
OH MY GOD, WHAT IS
HE DOING TO MY DOG?

03:37.318 --> 03:38.617
THERE HE GOES AGAIN!

03:38.619 --> 03:40.185
GET DOWN
SPARKY, DOWN!!

03:40.187 --> 03:41.420
STAN FORGOT
TO MENTION THAT

03:41.422 --> 03:43.488
HIS DOG IS A GAY,
HOMOSEXUAL.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.057
MAKE HIM STOP!

03:45.059 --> 03:47.259
( yelping )

03:47.261 --> 03:49.428
I'M SURE GLAD
MY DOG ISN'T GAY!

03:49.430 --> 03:53.532
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
NAME YOUR DOG SPARKETTE!

03:57.104 --> 03:57.870
AND SO YOU SEE,

03:57.872 --> 04:00.873
"SIMON AND SIMON" WERE
NOT BROTHERS IN REAL LIFE,

04:00.875 --> 04:02.040
ONLY ON TELEVISION.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.743
THANK YOU FOR THAT
PRESENTATION ERIC.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.679
BUT THE ASSIGNMENT
WAS ON ASIAN CULTURES,

04:07.681 --> 04:09.081
YOU GET A D-.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.015
DAMMIT!

04:10.017 --> 04:12.251
WHO SHOULD WE CALL
ON NEXT, MR. HAT?

04:12.253 --> 04:13.185
HOW ABOUT STAN,

04:13.187 --> 04:15.654
OUR LITTLE SOUTH PARK
QUARTERBACK STAR?

04:15.656 --> 04:16.555
GOOD IDEA.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.390
OKAY STANLEY,
YOU'RE NEXT.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.092
I'M NOT REALLY
PREPARED EITHER.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.594
JUST MAKE SOMETHING UP
LIKE ERIC DID.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.196
OKAY, UMM,

04:24.198 --> 04:25.430
ASIAN CULTURE HAS,

04:25.432 --> 04:27.266
PLAGUED OUR FRAGILE
EARTH FOR MANY YEARS.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.634
WE MUST END IT.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.168
EXCELLENT, A-!

04:30.170 --> 04:30.636
HEY!

04:30.638 --> 04:31.603
WOW, COOL!

04:31.605 --> 04:32.237
WAIT A MINUTE,

04:32.239 --> 04:33.705
WHY THE HELL DOES
HE GET AN A-?!

04:33.707 --> 04:36.642
ERIC, STANLEY JUST MIGHT
LEAD OUR TEAM TO VICTORY

04:36.644 --> 04:38.076
AGAINST THE
MIDDLE PARK COWBOYS

04:38.078 --> 04:39.745
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN DECADES!!

04:39.747 --> 04:41.413
AND WE TREAT
STAR ATHLETES BETTER

04:41.415 --> 04:43.282
BECAUSE THEY'RE
BETTER PEOPLE.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.049
THAT'S NOT FAIR!

04:44.051 --> 04:46.752
LIFE ISN'T FAIR KIDDO,
GET USED TO IT.

04:46.754 --> 04:47.986
STUPID PUPPET!

04:47.988 --> 04:49.788
DON'T FORGET YOUR
ASSIGNMENTS TONIGHT,

04:49.790 --> 04:52.124
THEY'RE DUE TOMORROW
FOR EVERYBODY BUT STAN.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.092
MR. GARRISON, CAN I
ASK YOU A QUESTION?

04:54.094 --> 04:56.028
OF COURSE STANLEY,
WHAT IS IT?

04:56.030 --> 04:58.163
WHAT'S A
HOMOSEXUAL?

04:58.165 --> 04:59.831
OH WELL STANLEY,

04:59.833 --> 05:01.833
I GUESS YOU CAME
TO THE RIGHT PERSON.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.135
SIT DOWN.

05:03.137 --> 05:06.204
STANLEY,
GAY PEOPLE...

05:06.206 --> 05:08.573
WELL, GAY PEOPLE
ARE EVIL.

05:08.575 --> 05:11.410
EVIL RIGHT DOWN TO
THEIR COLD BLACK HEARTS,

05:11.412 --> 05:13.679
WHICH PUMP, NOT BLOOD
LIKE YOURS AND MINE,

05:13.681 --> 05:15.614
BUT RATHER
A THICK VOMITUS OIL

05:15.616 --> 05:17.249
THAT OOZES THROUGH
THEIR ROTTEN VEINS,

05:17.251 --> 05:18.850
AND CLOTS IN THEIR
PEA-SIZED BRAINS,

05:18.852 --> 05:21.553
WHICH BECOMES THE CAUSE
OF THEIR NAZI-ESQUE PATTERNS

05:21.555 --> 05:23.055
OF VIOLENT BEHAVIOR.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.556
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

05:24.558 --> 05:25.023
I GUESS.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.559
GOOD, I'M GLAD WE COULD HAVE
THIS LITTLE TALK STANLEY.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.428
NOW YOU GO OUTSIDE AND
PRACTICE FOOTBALL

05:29.430 --> 05:31.797
LIKE A GOOD
LITTLE HETEROSEXUAL.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.767
( Cartman )
YOU GUYS SEE ME BLOCK
THAT DEFENSE TODAY?

05:35.769 --> 05:36.735
I WAS KICKING ASS.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.837
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO
KICK MORE ASS THAN THAT

05:38.839 --> 05:39.905
TO BEAT THE COWBOYS.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.074
HEY, SPEAKING OF
POUNDING ASS,

05:42.076 --> 05:44.042
HERE COMES STAN'S
LITTLE HOMO DOG!

05:44.044 --> 05:44.876
SHUT UP DUDE!

05:44.878 --> 05:47.846
SPARKY, WHERE'D YOU
GET THAT PINK SCARF?

05:47.848 --> 05:48.447
WOOF, WOOF.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.782
THAT IS THE GAYEST
DOG I HAVE EVER SEEN.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.884
HE JUST NEEDS SOME
TRAINING, THAT'S ALL.

05:52.886 --> 05:54.419
SIT SPARKY.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.822
GOD BOY,
NOW SHAKE.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.992
GOOD BOY, NOW,

05:59.994 --> 06:01.193
DON'T BE GAY!

06:01.195 --> 06:03.562
DON'T BE GAY
SPARK.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.397
DON'T BE GAY.

06:05.399 --> 06:06.598
DID IT WORK?

06:06.600 --> 06:07.232
I DON'T KNOW.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.234
HE STILL LOOKS
PRETTY GAY TO ME.

06:09.236 --> 06:09.801
HEY STAN,

06:09.803 --> 06:12.537
YOUR DOG BEEN TO ANY
ANY PRIDE MARCHES LATELY?

06:12.539 --> 06:14.506
YEAH, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD TAKE HIM TO

06:14.508 --> 06:17.309
A<i> BARBRA STREISAND</i> CONCERT!

06:17.311 --> 06:19.745
STUPID GAY DOG.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.180
COME ON YOU GUYS,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.422
I WANT $500 ON
THE SOUTH PARK COWS.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.323
ARE YOU CRAZY?

06:31.325 --> 06:33.992
NO SIREE,
I'M TELLING YOU,
I GOT THE LINE.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.395
MY NEPHEW STAN IS
THE BEST QUARTERBACK

06:36.397 --> 06:37.662
THE SCHOOL'S
EVER SEEN.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.565
I GUARANTEE THEY'LL
BEAT THE SPREAD.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.901
( man )
I'M GONNA PUT ALL
MY MONEY ON THE COWS.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.271
I'LL PUT $300
ON THE COWS TOO...

06:46.273 --> 06:48.240
( chatter )

06:48.876 --> 06:50.075
WHOA, WHOA.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.643
DON'T GET TOO
CARRIED AWAY NOW.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.379
YOU BETTER BE RIGHT
ABOUT THIS JIMBO.

06:54.381 --> 06:57.149
DON'T WORRY YOURSELF.

06:57.151 --> 06:59.785
ARE YOU SURE STAN
IS THAT GOOD?

06:59.787 --> 07:01.319
NOT THAT SURE.

07:01.321 --> 07:04.389
I THINK WE BETTER COME UP
WITH A BACK-UP PLAN.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.458
LET'S SEE HERE.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.059
HEY BOOKIE,

07:07.061 --> 07:09.127

SHOW GONNA BE?

07:09.129 --> 07:09.928
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD?

07:09.930 --> 07:12.431
<i>JOHN STAMOS'</i> OLDER
BROTHER RICHARD STAMOS

07:12.433 --> 07:14.399
IS GONNA SING
"LOVING YOU".

07:14.401 --> 07:15.700
I LOVE THAT SONG.

07:15.702 --> 07:18.070
"LOVING YOU",
THAT'S PERFECT.

07:18.072 --> 07:18.837
COME ON NED,

07:18.839 --> 07:21.039
MIDDLE PARK IS GONNA
GET A HALF-TIME SHOW

07:21.041 --> 07:23.075

07:25.946 --> 07:27.179
NOW WHY DON'T...

07:27.181 --> 07:27.813
DAMMIT SPARKY,

07:27.815 --> 07:29.281

SPARKY, BAD DOG!

07:31.251 --> 07:32.350

07:46.400 --> 07:47.799
WHO CARES IF
YOUR DOG IS GAY.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.067
MAYBE IT'S
NOT THAT BAD.

07:49.069 --> 07:49.668
NO WAY DUDE,

07:49.670 --> 07:51.236
MY MOM SAYS GOD
HATES GAY PEOPLE.

07:51.238 --> 07:54.806
THAT'S WHY HE "SMOKED"
THE<i> SODOMIES</i> IN FRANCE.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.541
( mumbling )

07:56.543 --> 07:59.644
I KNOW, MR. GARRISON SAID
HOMOSEXUALS ARE EVIL.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.179
BUT SPARKY DOESN'T
SEEM EVIL.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.714
MAYBE MR. GARRISON
IS WRONG.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.449
YOU SHOULD ASK
SOMEBODY ELSE.

08:04.451 --> 08:05.450
LIKE WHO?

08:05.452 --> 08:06.952
And now back to...

08:06.954 --> 08:08.887
on South Park
Public Access.

08:08.889 --> 08:11.823
Ye, many of you
are seeking answers,

08:11.825 --> 08:14.860
and I am the way
for you, my children.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.162
Let's open the
phone lines back up

08:17.164 --> 08:17.929
for some questions.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.764
Hello caller,
you're on the air.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.733
Yeah, is
this Jesus?

08:21.735 --> 08:22.534
Yes my son.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.269
This is Robert
from Torre Pines,

08:24.271 --> 08:27.405
I called last week asking
for advice on my ex-wife.

08:27.407 --> 08:29.508
Of course Robert,
how are things now?

08:29.510 --> 08:31.943
Everything is much
better Jesus,

08:31.945 --> 08:33.078
she hasn't
mouthed-off since.

08:33.080 --> 08:34.880
I just wanted to
thank you for
the advice.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.249
Oh, and for dying
for my sins too,

08:37.251 --> 08:38.717
that was really
nice of you.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.018
Blessed art thou,
Robert.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.052
Next caller,
you're on the air.

08:41.054 --> 08:45.757
( Stan )
Hi Jesus, I have
a dog and he's a,

08:45.759 --> 08:47.392
he's a homosexual.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.760
My son,

08:48.762 --> 08:49.961
a lot of people
have wondered

08:49.963 --> 08:51.763
what my stance
on homosexuality is,

08:51.765 --> 08:54.499
so I'd like to state
once and for all

08:54.501 --> 08:55.534
my true opinion.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.101
You see...

08:56.103 --> 08:57.536
That's all the time
we have left

08:57.538 --> 08:58.270
for "Jesus and Pals",

08:58.272 --> 09:00.906
now stay tuned for
"Marty's Movie Reviews".

09:00.908 --> 09:02.073

09:02.075 --> 09:04.142
I GOT CUT OFF FOR
"MARTY'S STUPID
MOVIE REVIEWS"!

09:04.144 --> 09:06.645
"MARTY'S MOVIE REVIEWS"

09:06.647 --> 09:08.580
ISN'T THERE ANYBODY
WHO CAN HELP ME?

09:08.582 --> 09:10.815
ISN'T THERE ANYBODY
WHO CARES?

09:10.817 --> 09:11.550
COME ON DUDE,

09:11.552 --> 09:12.417
WE HAVE TO GET
TO PRACTICE.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.219
IT'S NOT OKAY, I DON'T
WANT A GAY DOG.

09:14.221 --> 09:18.623
I WANT A BUTCH DOG,
I WANT A "RIN TIN TIN".

09:33.640 --> 09:34.372
NOW CHILDREN,

09:34.374 --> 09:36.508
WE'VE GOT TO HANDLE
THE BALL BETTER.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.476
YOU'VE GOT TO
HOLD YOUR FOOTBALL

09:38.478 --> 09:40.412

HOLD YOUR LOVER.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.447

11:13.240 --> 11:15.907
YOU CAN'T TEACH A GAY DOG

11:39.800 --> 11:42.667
MAYBE HE WENT SHOPPING

12:21.007 --> 12:22.741
WOW, IT'S BEEN

12:22.743 --> 12:24.142
I THINK HE MIGHT

13:17.531 --> 13:18.496
WELL, IT LOOKS
LIKE CHEF,

13:18.498 --> 13:20.432
THE SOUTH PARK COWS COACH,
IS A LITTLE NERVOUS.

13:20.434 --> 13:22.834
THIS IS PROBABLY BECAUSE
HIS STAR QUARTERBACK

13:22.836 --> 13:24.402
HAS YET TO SHOW UP.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.137
OH, COME ON STAN.

MY GAY DOG RAN AWAY

14:12.886 --> 14:14.752
