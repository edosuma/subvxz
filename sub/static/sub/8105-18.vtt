WEBVTT

00:45.921 --> 00:47.714
Hannah, you okay?

00:48.882 --> 00:52.093
- Still can't sleep?
- I'm fine.

00:55.514 --> 00:56.931
Can I do anything to help you?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.517
Just go back to sleep.
I'm going to go get a glass of wine.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.728
- I can keep you company.
- You have work in the morning.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.563
Are you sure you don't want me to?

01:03.689 --> 01:06.065
I'll be right back. Just sleep.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.327
Hannah?

01:22.291 --> 01:23.958
Hannah?

01:35.804 --> 01:37.555
What did you do?

01:37.681 --> 01:40.057
I just wanted to sleep.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.185
I'm calling an ambulance.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.156
You've seen one patient
in the last two hours.

02:37.282 --> 02:39.367
Complicated case.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.910
I'm a night owl.

02:41.036 --> 02:44.080
Wilson's an early bird.
We're different species.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.623
Move him into his own cage.

02:45.749 --> 02:48.251
Who'll clean the droppings from mine?

02:49.461 --> 02:52.713
Twenty-five-year-old female
with sleep issues.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.882
I'm guessing she's...

02:55.008 --> 02:58.219
What's the medical term? Upset!

02:58.345 --> 03:01.430
These 25-year-old females,
they're usually completely rational.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.432
They're rocks, really.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.811
My theory seems to be
supported by the fact

03:06.937 --> 03:08.813
that she swallowed
a bottle of sleeping pills.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.482
Get her a shrink. I need some shut-eye.

03:12.568 --> 03:16.487
She's a little bit more than upset.
She hasn't slept in ten days.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.489
She's lying.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.701
Without REM sleep,
your neurons start regenerating.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.036
Your brain shuts down lobe by lobe.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.290
She'd be insane after five days,
dead by ten.

03:27.416 --> 03:30.960
Give me a little credit.
I know what gets you off.

03:31.086 --> 03:34.046
She took the pills to sleep,
not to kill herself.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.132
- Clever alibi.
- They didn't work.

03:36.258 --> 03:39.677
She stayed awake, even though
she downed the whole bottle.

03:42.806 --> 03:46.976
And the longest anyone's ever survived
without sleep is 11 days.

03:47.102 --> 03:49.645
Which gives you about 22 hours.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.777
- You stole my article.
- I wouldn't do that.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.822
I wrote up the case where
we induced hypothermic cardiac arrest

03:59.948 --> 04:01.073
in the terminal cancer girl.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.742
I wrote my own. I didn't steal yours.

04:02.868 --> 04:06.162
You knew I was writing one.
You gave me notes!

04:06.288 --> 04:07.788
Got a case.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.417
It can wait. You two finish.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.170
Five bucks says someone loses an eye.

04:15.255 --> 04:18.007
Fine, you're only putting off
the inevitable.

04:18.133 --> 04:21.302
Twenty-five-year-old female
hasn't slept for ten days.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.430
I assume the ER tried giving her
some sedatives. We should up the
dosage.

04:24.556 --> 04:27.224
- Sedation isn't the same as sleep.
- Thanks for your insight.

04:27.351 --> 04:30.102
For someone who hasn't slept
in ten days, sedation is a great start.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.897
Sleep is an active process.
Reboots the system, restores the brain.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.149
- Sedatives don't...
- The brain is being stressed.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.275
We need to relieve that.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.819
You've had my article on your desk
for the last four months.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.029
I'm a very slow reader.

04:40.155 --> 04:43.157
No fever, no white count,
means no infection.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.617
Schizophrenia?

04:44.743 --> 04:47.620
- No delusions.
- You read his.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.580
Signed it. Didn't read it.

04:49.706 --> 04:53.084
Aside from the sleeping pills,
tox screen was clean.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.836
No cocaine, methamphetamines
or diet pills.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.838
The only medication she's had recently

04:57.965 --> 05:01.175
are steroids for poison ivy and
ibuprofen for a knee she hurt skiing.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.177
Nothing that would cause
sleep disturbances.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.597
- When did you get his article?
- About three weeks ago.

05:08.308 --> 05:11.143
- Let's go back to the beginning.
- How far back?

05:11.269 --> 05:12.895
Genesis.

05:13.021 --> 05:16.190
God said, "Let there be light."

05:17.275 --> 05:19.527
Sleep is initially controlled
by external light cues.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.946
And if her brain can't interpret
those cues...

05:22.072 --> 05:23.781
Optic nerve disease.

05:24.866 --> 05:27.243
I'm sensing another article.

05:27.369 --> 05:29.245
I'll go run the tests.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.959
I'm injecting a dye which will
allow us to take a look at your retina

05:35.085 --> 05:37.003
and your optic nerve.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.839
- Everything's kind of blurry.
- Normal, because of the dye.

05:39.965 --> 05:42.341
It's going to be that way
the next few hours.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.516
- Need a hand?
- No.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.686
Are we never going
to work together again?

05:53.812 --> 05:57.148
I just don't see the need to make you
feel better by forgiving you.

05:57.274 --> 06:00.109
I wasn't asking for forgiveness.
I was asking if you needed help.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.903
It's unprofessional to be talking
about this in front of the patient.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.281
Maybe that doesn't matter to you, but...

06:05.407 --> 06:08.117
It doesn't matter.
She's not listening.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.911
She's asleep.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.289
Normal stage-one brain waves.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.459
Maybe she's better?

06:19.379 --> 06:20.963
Still blurry.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.091
- You fell asleep.
- No, I didn't.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.387
Negative
for optic nerve disease.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.805
But she sleeps.

06:29.931 --> 06:33.059
For, like, ten seconds.
Maximum one minute.

06:33.185 --> 06:36.187
We also checked the ocular pressure.
It's normal.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.272
And she doesn't know she sleeps.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.816
The brain is often unaware
of stage one sleep.

06:40.942 --> 06:45.071
The CT showed no tumors,
no clots, no seizure disorder.

06:45.197 --> 06:48.616
So she sleeps.
She just can't stay asleep.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.410
You going somewhere with this?

06:51.536 --> 06:53.621
You know what keeps me awake at
night?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.539
Monsters in the closet.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.833
There's no monster in the closet.
We looked.

06:57.959 --> 07:01.170
Well, it's certainly not showing up
on the scans.

07:01.296 --> 07:02.838
Where's Cameron?

07:03.799 --> 07:06.717
She felt I could deliver the news
on my own.

07:08.887 --> 07:11.347
Oh, this is going to work out great.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.683
Come on.

07:17.896 --> 07:21.190
If you two guys can't play nice
together, I'm taking away your toys.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.692
- I don't care whose fault this is.
- If you hadn't...

07:23.819 --> 07:26.195
I especially don't care
if it was my fault.

07:26.321 --> 07:29.907
Whatever this woman has,
it's not showing up on our tests.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.828
Which means she's sick,
just not sick enough for us to see it.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.455
- You want us to make her sicker?
- Yes.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.292
I want to stress her body.
Specifically her brain.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.919
Keep her awake.

07:42.045 --> 07:45.339
Depriving her of even the few minutes
of sleep she does have, it's torture.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.299
So is cutting people with knives,

07:47.425 --> 07:49.927
but you can totally get away with that
if you have a doctor coat on.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.847
Those few seconds of sleep are maybe
the only reason she's still alive.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.432
The more symptoms we can force out
of her, the more tests we can do.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.434
The more tests we do,
the more information we get,

07:57.561 --> 07:59.895
the quicker we make a diagnosis.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.731
See how much more fun it is
when you guys get along?

08:02.858 --> 08:05.401
You two take the first four hours.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.117
Hannah?

08:15.412 --> 08:16.704
Hannah!

08:18.498 --> 08:20.541
You fell asleep.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.209
No, I didn't.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.712
Your brain doesn't remember.
It was just a few seconds.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.172
Is this really necessary?

08:26.298 --> 08:30.426
The sooner we find out what's wrong, the
sooner she can get a real night's rest.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.344
Hannah?

08:32.470 --> 08:34.805
Hannah? Hannah.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.226
Ow.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.605
- What did you do that for?
- You fell asleep again.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.356
- No, I didn't.
- We're sorry.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.525
We have to do this.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.736
We don't have to be cruel.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.488
You know what happens when you're
nice?
Nothing.

08:51.615 --> 08:54.241
That's how you define nice?
Not stealing?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.076
Doctors!

08:56.203 --> 08:58.412
Did she fall asleep again?

09:14.638 --> 09:17.681
- We've got rectal bleeding.
- What, all of you?

09:19.392 --> 09:22.895
So the monster is peeking out
from under the bed.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.147
Which either means
she has a clotting disorder

09:25.273 --> 09:26.857
or she has a tumor in her colon.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.569
- I'll do a colonoscopy.
- Who's keeping her awake now?

09:30.695 --> 09:33.280
I figured once we found another
symptom,
it really didn't matter.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.450
- Yeah, he's got all the ideas.
- Who is with her?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.286
Her partner's donating blood,
so she's with a nurse.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.456
Probably singing her lullabies.
I want her awake.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.750
You have to sedate a patient
to do a colonoscopy.

09:44.876 --> 09:47.044
Why? Just because of the pain?

09:48.338 --> 09:50.589
If you find a tumor in her colon,
you can knock her out.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.050
If you don't, she stays awake.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.889
Oh! God, it hurts!

09:59.015 --> 10:02.434
- Can't you hurry?
- Trust me, you don't want me to hurry.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.020
God, you're killing me!

10:05.146 --> 10:06.480
Hold my hand.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.401
Keep breathing, nice and steady.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.488
How am I supposed to work with him?

10:15.907 --> 10:18.742
Maybe we shouldn't be talking about this
right now?

10:18.868 --> 10:20.744
Think I'm overreacting?

10:22.497 --> 10:24.540
I need you to relax your anus.

10:26.668 --> 10:28.919
We're not here. We're skiing.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.880
It's Thanksgiving at Vail.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.925
You want me to think about nearly
killing myself on a snowboard?

10:35.051 --> 10:37.303
Come on, you never fell.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.639
You were awesome.

10:42.559 --> 10:46.687
Is that what you told him? I'm
hysterical and I need to relax my anus?

10:47.856 --> 10:50.733
I told him...
How many cases do we work up in a
year?

10:50.859 --> 10:53.444
They're all weird. He could have
written up any one of them.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.238
She's bleeding.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.033
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.451
Hold on.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.210
We packed her nose to control the bleed

11:10.337 --> 11:12.421
and started transfusing
two units of whole blood.

11:12.547 --> 11:16.008
The pathology from the rectal bleed
showed traces of nasal epithelium.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.093
So the butt bleed's just a nose bleed.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.637
That much blood
is not a "just a" anything.

11:20.764 --> 11:24.433
When two people fight this much,
you know what it means.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.393
It's gotta be a massive sinus hemorrhage

11:26.519 --> 11:28.479
that was draining down her throat
and out the back.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.398
- The question isn't what, it's why.
- Oh, get a room.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.567
Rat poison mixed with
some sort of neurogenic toxin

11:33.693 --> 11:35.486
could cause bleeding
and sleep disturbances.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.780
Do you have a specific type
of neurogenic toxin in mind,

11:37.906 --> 11:40.449
or should we just start running
a thousand different tox screens?

11:40.575 --> 11:42.409
Just pretend I'm not here.
I'll be reading.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.161
It could also be
some type of coagulopathy.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.580
Or it could be us.
Do you have any idea what it feels like

11:46.706 --> 11:49.416
to have a six-foot-long hose
shoved into your large intestine?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.920
No, but I now have a much greater
respect for whichever basketball player

11:53.046 --> 11:54.380
you dated in college.

11:54.506 --> 11:58.550
We've basically been torturing
this girl for the last eight hours.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.636
We've been poking her foot,
not punching her face.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.638
Extreme stress can cause
high blood pressure,

12:02.764 --> 12:05.432
- which can cause bleeding.
- Wouldn't keep her awake for ten days.

12:05.558 --> 12:09.186
What if the poison ivy
wasn't poison ivy?

12:10.688 --> 12:13.565
She got the rash
that was diagnosed as poison ivy

12:13.691 --> 12:15.692
around the same time
the insomnia started.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.529
Rash plus nose bleed
plus sleep disturbance

12:18.655 --> 12:21.031
equals Wegener's granulomatosis.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.825
Start corticosteroid treatment.

12:22.951 --> 12:26.036
- The poison ivy treatment was steroids.
- Much lower dosage.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.497
Get her back on the juice
and triple the dose.

12:28.623 --> 12:32.626
Get a cANCA and an upper airway biopsy
to confirm the Wegener's.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.516
She has menstrual problems.

12:47.642 --> 12:50.477
They're really bad.
The pain keeps her in bed all day.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.771
Plus, she's super depressed.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.571
She said, "Super depressed"?

13:01.990 --> 13:05.409
She heard that birth control pills
can make her feel better.

13:05.535 --> 13:08.579
She wants birth control pills
for her PMS.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.955
I guess.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.543
Judging by the redness
around your mom's nostrils

13:14.669 --> 13:17.212
and the tissue she's got
conveniently stashed in her wristband,

13:17.338 --> 13:21.300
I'd say her problem
is more likely a URI than a PMS.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.718
A URI?

13:22.844 --> 13:25.846
Upper respiratory infection. A cold.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.556
I don't think so.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.641
I also think she's got a problem
with a SAC.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.893
SAC?

13:31.019 --> 13:34.146
Thanks for playing.
Stupid American Child.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.191
If you want the pill, all you have to do

13:37.317 --> 13:41.153
is to walk into any health clinic
in Jersey, alone, and ask for it.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.947
What exactly was your plan?

13:44.073 --> 13:46.074
You're going to exchange
the birth control pills

13:46.201 --> 13:48.035
for some over-the-counter
decongestants

13:48.161 --> 13:50.621
and hope that your mom's cold
lasts another six years?

13:50.747 --> 13:51.788
No.

13:53.666 --> 13:58.170
- Is that for a cold?
- No, that's for your ovaries.

13:58.296 --> 14:01.632
I assume you haven't had a stroke.
Have you ever had a blood clot?

14:01.758 --> 14:04.092
- No.
- Super.

14:04.219 --> 14:07.554
In three months when you need a refill,
take a bus to a free clinic.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.349
Don't wait around hoping for Mom
to get another sniffle.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.895
Not the sharpest chopstick
in the drawer, is she?

14:16.940 --> 14:18.607
Was this just one of your experiments?

14:18.733 --> 14:22.110
You just wanted to see how I'd react
to being screwed over by Foreman?

14:23.363 --> 14:27.074
Nice idea, but no. This was just
good old-fashioned laziness.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.118
I gotta hand it to Foreman, though.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.913
He knew that you were a suck-up
and I don't give a crap.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.998
He successfully exploited us both.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.502
Right, we're both victims.
A simple heads up, that's all I needed.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.754
Maybe between
your incredibly witty remarks

14:40.880 --> 14:43.882
about anal sex and Cuddy's breasts,
you could have tipped me off.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.260
Yeah, but then I'd have Foreman
pissed at me.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.053
And as annoying as you could be,

14:48.179 --> 14:51.348
at least I know
you're not gonna pop a cap in my ass.

14:51.474 --> 14:52.933
Witty, huh?

14:56.604 --> 14:59.898
You, on the other hand,
continue to be flabbergasted

15:00.024 --> 15:03.694
every time someone actually acts
like a human being.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.905
Foreman did what he did because
it worked out best that way for him.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.699
That's what everyone does.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.076
That is not the definition
of being human.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.870
It's the definition of being an ass.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.669
This will numb you up.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.258
And this will keep your tongue
out of the way.

15:27.552 --> 15:30.596
Don't worry. You shouldn't feel anything
except for a slight pulling.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.472
So, do you think I was out of line?

15:32.599 --> 15:36.059
That article would have sat on House's
desk for the next six years.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.312
I could've told her.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.607
You could have written it for her, too.
She knows House as well as any of us.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.650
She should've known
she was waiting for him

15:43.776 --> 15:46.028
to do something he was never gonna do.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.199
Chase?

15:53.828 --> 15:55.245
Hannah? You still with us?

15:55.371 --> 15:58.081
- What's wrong with her eyes?
- It looks like REM.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.791
- What's that?
- Rapid Eye Movements.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.585
It's what your eyes do
when you're sleeping.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.587
- But she's awake.
- Hannah!

16:04.464 --> 16:06.423
Hannah, can you hear me?

16:07.383 --> 16:08.884
Yeah, of course.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.929
- Was she sitting up or lying down?
- Sitting up.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.139
Then it wasn't REM.

16:14.265 --> 16:16.141
Chase says her eyes were moving
the exact way...

16:16.267 --> 16:17.476
You start her on the steroids?

16:17.602 --> 16:19.936
- Not yet. We were still doing...
- Then she wasn't sleeping.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.856
- How do you know?
- Because we haven't done anything yet.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.776
She may be able to sleep with her
eyes open, but unless you also discover

16:25.902 --> 16:28.111
she's got two extra teats
and hooves for feet,

16:28.237 --> 16:30.614
there's no way she'd be able to maintain
enough muscle tensity

16:30.740 --> 16:32.532
during REM sleep to sit upright.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.578
It's a movement disorder,
which rules out Wegener's.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.954
Where's Foreman?

16:38.081 --> 16:39.873
- Keeping her awake.
- Good.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.251
Rabies could cause muscle spasms,
malaise, anxiety and wakefulness.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.754
Pretty unlikely she'd forget
being bitten by a crazed animal.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.756
She could've been exposed
through an open wound.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.508
- Does she have a dog?
- For less than a week.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.802
She had an allergic reaction,
so they had to give it away.

16:51.928 --> 16:52.928
Allergies.

16:53.054 --> 16:55.430
Animal allergies seems unlikely,
but it's possible that...

16:55.556 --> 16:57.557
- When?
- When what?

16:57.684 --> 17:00.060
- When did she get rid of the dog?
- About a month ago.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.063
Her girlfriend gave it to her
for her birthday.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.565
Well, then, it's not allergies.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.693
She's just leaving her girlfriend.

17:09.904 --> 17:12.406
You... spoke to the dog?

17:12.532 --> 17:14.116
If her birthday was a month ago,

17:14.242 --> 17:16.535
she would have still been on steroids
for the poison ivy.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.537
Those meds would have suppressed
any reaction

17:18.663 --> 17:19.830
she might have had to the dog,

17:19.956 --> 17:22.582
which means she lied about being
allergic. A dog's a commitment.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.502
You pretend to be allergic because
you don't want to tell your girlfriend

17:25.628 --> 17:27.838
that you're not planning
on being around that long.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.549
So, I think we can move on
to options other than allergies.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.342
We should still do
a scratch test.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.971
- If she's allergic to one thing...
- She is not allergic.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.932
Okay. Well, we could either base
our diagnosis

17:39.058 --> 17:41.601
on your admittedly keen understanding
of lesbian relationships,

17:41.728 --> 17:44.062
or we could do a scratch test.

17:47.275 --> 17:49.109
Do a scratch test.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.032
Are you still feeling
a lot of blood in your throat?

17:56.159 --> 17:57.993
No, it's actually getting
a little better.

17:58.119 --> 18:01.163
Good, maybe things are just starting
to improve on their own.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.789
Just a few more.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.126
- Want some water to wash your mouth?
- No, I'm okay.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.795
Come on, that can't taste good.
I'm gonna get you a soda.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.630
It's okay, isn't it?

18:15.720 --> 18:18.555
You and Max seem to have a
really nice relationship.

18:18.681 --> 18:20.932
- Yeah.
- She's very supportive.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.688
When Max got you the dog,

18:26.814 --> 18:29.858
did you lie about having
an allergic reaction?

18:31.360 --> 18:32.444
No.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.656
- Why?
- If you have preexisting conditions,

18:36.783 --> 18:40.577
it's important we know, but
if you don't, it's just as important.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.246
If I'm wasting my time doing this...

18:43.372 --> 18:45.415
You're not going to tell her, are you?

18:47.376 --> 18:48.627
It's none of my business.

18:48.753 --> 18:52.756
She's a good person, and we've just
been together so long, I...

18:56.719 --> 18:58.261
I'm tired of her.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.810
It sounds terrible, doesn't it?

19:06.687 --> 19:08.939
I guess it happens sometimes.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.733
My back hurts.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.699
Hannah, can you turn over?

19:19.826 --> 19:22.661
- What's wrong?
- I'm not sure.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.459
Oh, my God.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.548
- She has massive internal bleeding.
- Did she have access to aspirin?

19:34.674 --> 19:35.966
She'd have to take a hell of a lot.

19:36.092 --> 19:39.386
Why not?
Considering her current mental state.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.805
What about her mental state?

19:41.931 --> 19:44.474
You were right about her
wanting to break up.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.852
That just means I was right.
Doesn't mean she's suicidal.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.312
A bottle of pills is what
landed her here in the first place.

19:49.438 --> 19:52.691
Sleeping pills.
God knows why she'd want them.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.070
What else could cause sleep disorder
and internal bleeding?

19:57.196 --> 20:00.824
Drugs or alcohol could mess with
the sleeping and compromise the liver.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.243
What are you doing here?
Who's keeping her awake?

20:03.369 --> 20:06.788
Doesn't matter. Liver function tests
are through the sky.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.749
Liver's not compromised. It's dead.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.711
She doesn't need a diagnosis.
She needs a new liver.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.882
She's not getting a new liver unless
we can figure out what's wrong with her.

20:17.008 --> 20:19.259
Test for cirrhosis, 12 hours.
Test for hepatitis, eight.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.011
Her liver's not gonna last another six.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.513
So your advice is we just give up?

20:23.639 --> 20:26.683
My advice is that we narrow our focus
to conditions that we can diagnose,

20:26.809 --> 20:29.019
treat and cure in less than six hours.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.314
And there's nothing on that list.

20:34.650 --> 20:37.068
The girlfriend donated blood, right?

20:37.194 --> 20:38.820
Yeah, so?

20:38.946 --> 20:40.864
It means they're the same type.

20:41.782 --> 20:45.869
You can't ask the person she's about
to dump to donate half her liver.

20:45.995 --> 20:48.163
It does seem tacky, doesn't it?

20:56.923 --> 20:59.049
I'm Dr House.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.426
I'm in charge of your case.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.470
What's going on?

21:03.596 --> 21:06.556
How come no one
is keeping her awake anymore?

21:06.682 --> 21:08.725
You're in acute liver failure.

21:10.227 --> 21:13.188
We can continue the transfusions
and the lactulose,

21:13.314 --> 21:15.148
but it's only a stopgap.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.151
There's really nothing we can do
to stop the toxins

21:18.277 --> 21:21.029
from building up in your bloodstream,

21:21.155 --> 21:24.324
which means that, in a few hours,

21:24.450 --> 21:26.451
you will lapse into a coma...

21:28.245 --> 21:30.080
...and you won't wake up.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.170
I'm sorry.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.049
That's it? You're giving up?

21:41.175 --> 21:44.719
You're not going to try to figure out
what's doing this to her?

21:44.845 --> 21:46.596
Well, even with the right diagnosis,

21:46.722 --> 21:49.099
any treatment's gonna take longer
than the time she has left.

21:49.225 --> 21:52.435
If it's her liver,
can't she get a transplant?

21:52.561 --> 21:54.813
Wouldn't work without a diagnosis.

21:54.939 --> 21:58.191
Whatever killed the first liver
would do the same to the second.

21:58.317 --> 22:03.238
But it would give you more time
to make the diagnosis to get her better.

22:05.950 --> 22:09.411
Well, it might give us
an extra day or two,

22:09.537 --> 22:12.372
but no procurement agency
is gonna let a liver go to a patient

22:12.498 --> 22:14.290
with an undiagnosed, preexisting...

22:14.417 --> 22:16.793
Hannah and I have the same blood type.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.878
Couldn't I be the donor?

22:26.470 --> 22:29.848
Well, it is medically possible
for us to take a part of your...

22:29.974 --> 22:32.726
Please, I don't care about the risks.

22:43.029 --> 22:46.031
You're very lucky
to have such a devoted partner.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.465
I just bought us 36 hours.

23:03.591 --> 23:07.135
Differential diagnosis.
Which monster eats your liver,

23:07.261 --> 23:09.054
screws up your sleep
and causes bleeding?

23:09.180 --> 23:10.764
Does Max know Hannah plans to leave
her?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.640
Didn't come up, so I guess no.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.809
If she knew, there's no way
she'd go through with this.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.853
And if you didn't have
a pathological need

23:16.979 --> 23:19.939
to create a close, personal relationship
with every dying person you meet,

23:20.066 --> 23:22.317
we would be blissfully ignorant
of any ethical dilemmas

23:22.443 --> 23:24.944
and might actually be able to
concentrate on the differential.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.362
The scratch test was negative.

23:26.489 --> 23:29.407
It's rare, but any of the hepatitis
viruses could cause sleep disturbances

23:29.533 --> 23:31.242
- and liver failure.
- No, PCRs were normal.

23:31.368 --> 23:35.705
- We have an ethical dilemma.
- No, we don't. Continue.

23:35.831 --> 23:39.000
What about splenic cancer
or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?

23:39.126 --> 23:40.293
She's the right age.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.962
It could explain the bleeding,
maybe the liver failure.

23:43.089 --> 23:46.674
We're withholding information relevant
to her decision to risk her life.

23:46.801 --> 23:49.928
- How is that not an ethical dilemma?
- It's not medical information.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.930
- Who cares?
- The AMA.

23:52.056 --> 23:55.308
Wilson's disease could
explain
the liver and neurological symptoms.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.851
It also causes bleeding disorders.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.812
No Kayser-Fleischer rings in her eyes.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.356
Rings don't have to be there
if there's neurological symptoms.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.942
- This is immoral.
- Look, let's say you're right!

24:04.068 --> 24:07.821
We tell, she changes her mind,
our patient dies. How is that moral?

24:09.073 --> 24:10.156
What else?

24:10.282 --> 24:12.158
Poisoned mushrooms
can cause liver failure,

24:12.284 --> 24:13.993
sleep disturbances
and internal bleeding.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.496
She's not shrooming. She's a sports nut.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.623
Right, skiers never party.

24:18.749 --> 24:21.042
She's doing this out of love,
and Max doesn't know...

24:21.168 --> 24:24.420
It's only moral to save a person
if they love you?

24:24.547 --> 24:27.132
That's kind of a selfish way
of looking at life.

24:27.258 --> 24:30.051
I like Wilson's disease,
like cancer, love mushrooms.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.387
Yeah, but we don't have the time
to test for any of it.

24:32.513 --> 24:36.015
Before she can get the transplant,
we need to do about 80 procedures.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.434
So, do those tests
and my tests at the same time.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.645
Use the PET to look for cancer
and Wilson's.

24:40.771 --> 24:43.940
While you endoscope her bile ducts,
scrape her stomach for mushroom
spores.

24:44.066 --> 24:45.567
One of you CT her liver,

24:45.693 --> 24:49.821
while the other two
check protein CA-125 and CA-19.5.

24:49.989 --> 24:53.867
Oh, yeah, anyone says anything to Max,
they're fired.

24:55.161 --> 24:56.369
We have to.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.789
We have to not,
because she's not our patient.

24:59.915 --> 25:03.084
She's getting surgery.
She's someone's patient.

25:05.921 --> 25:08.339
I think that's it. Great, thank you.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.883
I need a little help.

25:10.009 --> 25:13.428
Inexplicable rash on a patient's scrotum
you need me to look at?

25:13.554 --> 25:16.097
Twenty-seven-year-old female
wants to donate half her liver

25:16.223 --> 25:19.225
- to her dying girlfriend.
- That's very generous.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.061
This the sleepless girl? What's she got?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.396
Liver failure.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.691
Sort of figured that out when you said
she needed a new liver.

25:29.278 --> 25:32.906
- You don't have a diagnosis?
- The transplant buys me time.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.158
Let's just skip the part
where I say this is insane.

25:35.284 --> 25:36.451
It was her idea.

25:36.577 --> 25:39.287
If she wants to be an idiot,
it's her call. You don't need me.

25:39.413 --> 25:41.623
Have one of your team
walk her through the process.

25:41.749 --> 25:44.876
The donor and the donee
sort of have opposing interests, right?

25:45.002 --> 25:46.878
We can't really advise them both.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.881
You're concerned
about the ethics of this?

25:50.007 --> 25:51.382
What's going on?

25:51.508 --> 25:54.135
- What do you know?
- Nothing medically relevant.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.721
But you know something,
and it is relevant.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.141
If I can't tell her,
I can't really tell you, can I?

26:00.267 --> 26:02.227
I mean, if you're advising her.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.563
I assume this information
is in the medical file.

26:05.689 --> 26:09.234
- In my patient's confidential file.
- This hospital's file.

26:12.238 --> 26:15.615
You can either satisfy your curiosity,
or you can remain ignorant,

26:15.741 --> 26:20.078
do nothing ethically wrong, and
my patient doesn't die in three hours.

26:27.127 --> 26:30.338
These tests and the counseling

26:30.464 --> 26:34.217
normally happen over weeks,
sometimes months.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.386
It's okay.

26:37.638 --> 26:40.181
Well, the most important part
we're skipping is time.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.892
Time for you to change your mind.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.144
I don't wanna change my mind.

26:45.271 --> 26:50.650
Not now, but, with time and perspective,
maybe we learn things...

26:50.776 --> 26:52.944
If we had the time, we'd take the time,
but we don't.

26:53.070 --> 26:55.113
So can you get this over with?

26:57.741 --> 27:01.286
Either I sign off on this,
or it doesn't happen.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.497
So I need you to listen to me,

27:04.623 --> 27:08.459
because there's a chance
that you will die on that table.

27:16.260 --> 27:20.763
I just want me and Hannah
to be able to lie in bed together

27:20.889 --> 27:23.516
as old ladies,

27:23.642 --> 27:25.351
compare scars.

27:33.819 --> 27:37.196
I need you to lie on your side
and hold your knees.

27:41.744 --> 27:43.786
I'm going to check
for vascular abnormalities

27:43.912 --> 27:46.289
that might prevent us
from doing the transplant.

27:46.415 --> 27:48.750
At the same time,
I'm also checking for mushroom spores

27:48.876 --> 27:51.169
- to see if that's the underlying...
- I don't do mushrooms.

27:51.295 --> 27:54.505
If you lie about your love life,
maybe you lie about drugs. Open.

27:58.218 --> 28:01.137
Aren't you at all concerned about
what Max is going through right now?

28:01.263 --> 28:03.014
They're shoving a tube up her rectum,

28:03.140 --> 28:05.433
then they're going to swab her stomach
just like I'm doing.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.894
It's going to hurt just like this hurts.

28:08.020 --> 28:12.398
Which is nothing at all like the risk
she's taking on the table.

28:15.694 --> 28:17.695
And you don't love her, do you?

28:17.821 --> 28:19.447
I'm not leaving her because I don't...

28:19.573 --> 28:22.950
I'm not talking about the leaving.
I'm talking about this.

28:23.077 --> 28:25.995
If you care for her at all,
you won't let her do this blind.

28:30.501 --> 28:32.543
- You'd really tell?
- Yeah.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.172
You'd die?

28:45.516 --> 28:47.642
I take it you've seen that.

28:50.354 --> 28:54.607
Seen it, digested it, watched it
blow up my entire department.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.652
- Did you read Cameron's version?
- I didn't read either.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.112
It was good.

28:59.238 --> 29:02.073
- Better than Foreman's?
- Maybe.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.952
He was more analytical
about the diagnostic procedures.

29:06.078 --> 29:09.288
She concentrated more on the
ethical dilemmas of informed consent.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.916
How any patient can really be informed
without a medical degree.

29:12.042 --> 29:13.876
Same old party lines.

29:14.670 --> 29:18.506
- Foreman should have told her.
- Oh, shoulda, woulda, coulda.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.591
If you allow this sort of thing
in your department,

29:20.717 --> 29:22.260
you're basically saying it's okay.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.720
No, I'm saying that I don't care
what they do

29:24.847 --> 29:28.266
as long as my life isn't interrupted by
pointless conversations like this one.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.852
They won't trust each other,
and they won't trust you.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.520
They shouldn't.

29:32.646 --> 29:35.106
Deception like this
is just one step removed

29:35.232 --> 29:38.359
from actively sabotaging one another.

29:38.485 --> 29:39.735
Then what would you do?

29:39.862 --> 29:43.239
I could be the kindest,
gentlest boss in the world,

29:43.365 --> 29:46.409
and Foreman would still have done
what he did, because that's who he is.

29:46.535 --> 29:50.121
We can only hope that Cameron
has learned something.

29:50.247 --> 29:53.583
Right,
because you're all about the teaching.

29:54.585 --> 29:56.627
Our children are the future.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.010
Hey.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.512
Cuddy cleared Max for surgery.
She's okay to go.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.764
- How's our patient?
- She's also cleared.

30:08.891 --> 30:11.976
I don't care about the prep.
I care about the diagnostic tests.

30:12.102 --> 30:14.687
Looks negative for Wilson's disease.
We'll know for sure in an hour.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.106
- Blood proteins are normal. It's not...
- Where's Cameron?

30:17.232 --> 30:18.983
Taking a sample of the bile duct.

30:19.985 --> 30:22.111
Surgeries are supposed to start
in about 15 minutes.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.529
She had a chance to get one last...

30:23.655 --> 30:25.156
Hannah and Max will be in the same
room.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.200
You wanted us to do
as much as we can before...

30:27.326 --> 30:29.744
They're both awake with Cameron.

30:35.042 --> 30:39.128
Maybe we should give these two
a minute together before the surgery.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.047
You ready, honey?

30:44.009 --> 30:47.178
- Max.
- It's okay, I'm right here.

30:48.514 --> 30:51.057
- I need you to know something.
- I know.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.684
I love you, too.

30:55.103 --> 30:57.396
- I don't know how to say this.
- Good Lord!

30:57.523 --> 31:01.317
- You can tell me anything.
- She hasn't slept in 11 days!

31:01.443 --> 31:03.778
You people trying to torture her?

31:08.325 --> 31:10.076
Ding, ding, let's go.

31:14.998 --> 31:17.291
- I told you...
- I didn't say a word to Max.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.877
This is exactly why you got screwed
with Foreman.

31:20.003 --> 31:22.129
You're looking for people
to do the right thing.

31:22.256 --> 31:24.048
She hasn't slept.
Her judgment is compromised

31:24.174 --> 31:26.008
due to inactivity
in her prefrontal cortex.

31:26.134 --> 31:29.929
Oh, she could have the best prefrontal
cortex in the history of mankind,

31:30.055 --> 31:31.639
but given the choice
of life versus death,

31:31.765 --> 31:34.850
those bad, bad people
are going to choose life.

31:34.977 --> 31:37.895
Then why'd you sedate her?
If she wasn't going to tell,

31:38.021 --> 31:41.274
if she was never going to do the right
thing, why bother knocking her out?

31:42.693 --> 31:45.987
This isn't about them. If she talks,
if she does the decent thing,

31:46.113 --> 31:49.323
then you don't get to solve your puzzle,
your game's over, you lose.

31:49.449 --> 31:52.368
Yeah, I wanna save her.
I'm morally bankrupt.

32:14.850 --> 32:15.975
How's it going?

32:16.101 --> 32:18.185
They're about to remove Hannah's liver.

32:22.482 --> 32:25.276
All right, I'm good to go.

32:25.402 --> 32:27.820
You can start removing Max's liver.

32:29.197 --> 32:32.533
You wanna let me in on what
the big secret is between these two?

32:32.659 --> 32:34.577
You read Foreman's article?

32:36.371 --> 32:37.913
It was good.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.751
He basically stole it from me.

32:43.086 --> 32:46.255
- So?
- You're on his side?

32:46.381 --> 32:48.883
Sides? No, this isn't dodgeball.

32:50.052 --> 32:52.720
What am I supposed to do,
just sit back and take it?

32:52.846 --> 32:54.555
No, write another article.

32:54.681 --> 32:57.350
Kick ass until you're sitting behind
some big, expensive desk,

32:57.476 --> 33:00.102
and someone from Johns Hopkins calls
and says,

33:00.228 --> 33:04.106
"We're thinking about hiring
Eric Foreman as our head of Neurology."

33:04.232 --> 33:06.776
And you can say whatever you want.

33:06.902 --> 33:11.072
Lovely. Revenge as motive for success.

33:11.198 --> 33:14.742
Well, it doesn't have to be the motive,
but it sure tastes good.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.829
- She's in VF. I've got no pulse.
- She's arresting.

33:22.459 --> 33:25.169
I am so relieved
you two are here.

33:25.295 --> 33:27.755
Without you looking out,
they'd be playing foosball down there.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.966
- Max's heart stopped.
- Your patient is on the other side.

33:31.093 --> 33:33.552
Now get yourself upstairs
and figure out what Hannah has,

33:33.679 --> 33:36.305
or Max has risked her life for nothing.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.810
Charging.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.396
Clear.

33:48.318 --> 33:49.568
We're okay.

33:55.117 --> 33:59.537
Max's cardiac arrest was caused
by hypoxia from hypoventilation.

33:59.663 --> 34:00.955
They restarted her heart,

34:01.081 --> 34:04.834
and the right lobe of her liver was
successfully transplanted into Hannah.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.794
Now, where were we

34:06.920 --> 34:09.672
before we were so rudely interrupted
by the liver transplant?

34:09.798 --> 34:11.882
Dopa decarboxylase
was processed normally,

34:12.008 --> 34:14.135
and the ceruloplasmin
and copper levels were normal.

34:14.261 --> 34:15.344
So, no Wilson's disease.

34:15.470 --> 34:18.514
Gastric content was negative for spores,
so no mushroom toxicity.

34:18.640 --> 34:20.891
And initial tests
were negative for cancer.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.893
- Which cancer were you looking for?
- Any of them.

34:23.019 --> 34:25.396
We ran blood tests
for ovarian, lung and lymphomas.

34:25.522 --> 34:26.605
Not gonna tell you much.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.233
Her blood was taken
after she was given
immunosuppressants.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.110
They fight rejection.

34:31.236 --> 34:33.946
They also mess up our ability
to get any clear readings.

34:35.532 --> 34:38.242
Great battles kick up a lot of dirt.

34:39.453 --> 34:43.247
Obscure the battlefield
so generals can't see what's going on.

34:44.374 --> 34:47.042
So, what are your orders, General
House?

34:49.004 --> 34:50.588
Sound the retreat.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.634
How you feeling?

34:55.761 --> 34:56.927
Is Max okay?

34:57.053 --> 34:59.764
She's still unconscious,
but her vitals look good.

35:00.891 --> 35:04.018
We need to stop
all the immunosuppressant drugs

35:04.144 --> 35:06.270
which are protecting your new liver.

35:08.231 --> 35:11.317
But if you stop the drugs, I'll die.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.570
You're dead anyway if we don't
figure out what caused all this.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.115
By removing any outside influences,

35:18.241 --> 35:20.618
it'll help us see
what's really going on with your body.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.787
So you did all this
to buy me a couple of days,

35:22.913 --> 35:25.039
and now you're taking one back?

35:29.211 --> 35:30.795
Will it hurt?

35:32.339 --> 35:34.507
As your body goes into
acute organ rejection,

35:34.633 --> 35:38.052
your liver will begin to swell,
and that'll put pressure on...

35:39.679 --> 35:42.097
Yeah, it'll hurt.

35:42.224 --> 35:43.974
But we can knock you out.

35:45.018 --> 35:48.312
No, if Max wakes up,
I want to talk to her.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.864
She's been taking the decongestants,
but she's not getting better.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.909
- She also says...
- What?

36:03.495 --> 36:05.246
Her boobs are bigger.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.673
How could you get them mixed up?

36:15.799 --> 36:19.009
They come in a little wheel. They
don't look anything like decongestants.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.178
Oh, God. The cashier
put them both in the same bag.

36:21.304 --> 36:23.264
I thought I gave her the right ones.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.191
No, you gave her the wrong pills.

36:34.317 --> 36:37.027
You speak Mandarin?

36:37.153 --> 36:41.073
I can count to ten,
ask to go to the bathroom and...

36:45.453 --> 36:48.372
I'm not pregnant.
We haven't even done it yet!

36:51.877 --> 36:54.128
Okay,
I'm going to leave you two alone now.

36:54.254 --> 36:56.422
I'm sure you got a lot to talk about.

37:03.179 --> 37:06.015
Fever is 106.
She's in full rejection mode.

37:06.141 --> 37:07.975
Is that supposed to surprise me?

37:08.101 --> 37:10.019
Her white count is normal.

37:11.187 --> 37:14.273
Normal is not normal.
She's been on steroids.

37:14.399 --> 37:17.026
The transplant team gave her
a cocktail of immunosuppressants.

37:17.152 --> 37:20.154
She hasn't slept in over a week.
Her white count should be in the tank.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.239
Looks like the problem
is some sort of infection.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.867
Probably caused
the hypotension, shocked the liver.

37:24.993 --> 37:27.119
We should start
broad-spectrum antibiotics.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.538
Yeah, you might want to add
some chicken soup.

37:29.664 --> 37:32.416
It'd be just as useless,
but it's got chicken.

37:32.542 --> 37:35.169
We need to know exactly what kind
of infection we're dealing with.

37:35.295 --> 37:38.339
What infection causes sleep disturbance,
bleeding, a movement disorder,

37:38.465 --> 37:40.883
organ failure
and an abnormally normal white count.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.760
- What about tularemia?
- Chest was clear.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.678
Tularemia doesn't cause
movement disorders.

37:44.804 --> 37:48.724
- It would if she developed meningitis.
- There was no ulcerations on the skin.

37:48.850 --> 37:51.143
With the bleeding,
it looks more like leptospirosis.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.437
Without conjunctivitis
and elevated creatinine?

37:53.563 --> 37:55.648
What about typhoid
or some kind of relapsing fever?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.232
Makes sense, if we were in the Sudan.

37:57.359 --> 37:59.193
Are you sure she hasn't
been out of the country?

37:59.319 --> 38:02.071
She hasn't even been out of the state
in at least a year. Neither has Max.

38:02.197 --> 38:03.948
Maybe she lied.

38:04.074 --> 38:07.159
- You talk to her friends, neighbors?
- You don't know?

38:07.285 --> 38:09.286
Come on, if you don't stay
up-to-date on my notes,

38:09.412 --> 38:11.664
where's your next article
gonna come from?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.415
Talked to the dog?

38:13.541 --> 38:16.001
We're not as up on foreign languages
as you are.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.922
- Has the dog been traveling?
- It came from a breeder.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.758
- Where?
- I don't know.

38:24.219 --> 38:25.928
Place called Blue Barrel Kennels.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.846
They only had the thing
for, like, two days.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.933
Blue barrel is a kind of cactus.

38:31.059 --> 38:33.352
You see many cacti in Jersey?

38:42.195 --> 38:44.196
Wanna see a magic trick?

38:50.036 --> 38:52.913
Oh, no. Where'd it go? Where'd it go?

38:53.039 --> 38:54.289
Is it here?

38:55.792 --> 38:58.043
No. What about here?

39:00.255 --> 39:01.880
There it is.

39:02.966 --> 39:06.176
Oh, that doesn't look anything
like a nose.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.263
That wasn't there this
morning.

39:23.862 --> 39:27.906
- Get that to the lab and call the CDC.
- Tell them what?

39:28.033 --> 39:30.951
That we have a patient with the plague.

39:32.037 --> 39:36.331
- The black plague?
- Looks that way.

39:36.458 --> 39:38.292
Plague is carried by rodents, not dogs.

39:38.418 --> 39:42.046
Where there's dogs, there's fleas.
If they hail from the Southwest,

39:42.172 --> 39:44.089
then those fleas
can't tell the difference

39:44.215 --> 39:46.800
between prairie dogs and puppy dogs.

39:46.926 --> 39:50.971
A small percentage of plague cases
present with sleep disturbance.

39:52.432 --> 39:55.684
Imagine an idyllic river of bacteria.

39:57.187 --> 39:59.646
Okay, it's not idyllic for her,
but it serves my purposes.

39:59.773 --> 40:01.356
The steroids and immunosuppressants

40:01.483 --> 40:04.777
acted like a big honking dam
across the river. Physics 101.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.863
Put a dam up in front of a raging river,
the river rises.

40:07.989 --> 40:10.657
By stopping the immunosuppressants,
we blew up the dam,

40:10.784 --> 40:13.911
and a 100-foot wall of bacteria
flooded her lymph nodes.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.996
We better find out
where that dog is now.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.123
After you restart
the immunosuppressants,

40:18.249 --> 40:19.958
and fill her up to the eyeballs

40:20.085 --> 40:22.711
with streptomycin sulfate,
gentamicin and tetracycline.

40:22.837 --> 40:24.463
Use a garden hose if we've got one.

40:24.589 --> 40:27.633
Get yourselves
some prophylactic treatments as well.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.095
I've got the plague?

40:32.263 --> 40:34.723
Don't worry, it's treatable.

40:34.849 --> 40:38.769
Being a bitch, though,
nothing we can do about that.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.695
You weren't in your room.

40:48.822 --> 40:51.907
The surgeon said I'd heal faster
if I walk.

40:52.033 --> 40:54.076
I got this far, needed a rest.

40:55.245 --> 40:57.913
What you did was crazy,
but it was pretty amazing, too.

40:58.039 --> 41:00.415
Yeah. I'm a hero.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.088
She's been planning to leave me.

41:09.175 --> 41:10.968
Really?

41:11.094 --> 41:14.096
She told a friend.
The friend let it slip.

41:17.267 --> 41:20.227
You knew, and you gave up
half your liver anyway?

41:23.314 --> 41:25.190
She can't leave me now.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.655
You really want her to stay
out of guilt?

41:31.781 --> 41:34.032
That's not gonna make
either of you happy.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.118
You don't know that.

41:36.244 --> 41:37.703
I love her.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.332
I just want her to stay.

41:59.475 --> 42:01.602
I don't own House's cases.

42:03.229 --> 42:06.231
You had just as much right as I did
to write it up.

42:06.357 --> 42:10.360
You should have told me, but
I should have handled it better, too.

42:12.989 --> 42:16.033
If we want this not to get in the way
of our friendship,

42:16.159 --> 42:20.662
I think we both have to apologize
and put it behind us.

42:24.083 --> 42:26.084
I like you, really.

42:26.211 --> 42:28.879
We have a good time working together.

42:29.005 --> 42:31.048
But 10 years from now,

42:31.174 --> 42:34.218
we're not gonna be hanging out
and having dinners.

42:34.344 --> 42:36.762
Maybe we'll exchange Christmas cards,
say hi,

42:36.888 --> 42:39.806
give a hug if we're at
the same conference.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.978
We're not friends. We're colleagues.

42:48.024 --> 42:50.901
And I don't have anything
to apologize for.
