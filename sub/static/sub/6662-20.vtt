WEBVTT

00:05.040 --> 00:06.540
My name is Bridget.

00:06.580 --> 00:07.920
I witnessed a murder.

00:07.960 --> 00:09.750
Just get up on the stand

00:09.800 --> 00:11.550
and tell the judge what you saw,
and we'll protect you.

00:11.590 --> 00:12.760
You don't get it.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.140
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:15.180 --> 00:18.300
BRIDGET: I ran to my sister
Siobhan for help.

00:18.350 --> 00:21.600
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:23.770 --> 00:26.770
Siobhan, I didn't tell you the
whole truth about Tyler Barrett.

00:26.810 --> 00:28.520
It was an accident.

00:28.570 --> 00:31.610
It's gonna be over soon.
We have the flash drive.

00:31.650 --> 00:33.610
What?

00:33.650 --> 00:36.240
-I gave it to Tim Arbogast.
-Why would you do that?

00:36.280 --> 00:38.410
We got a tip linking you
to the crime.

00:38.450 --> 00:40.040
Your father-in-law's
the one who turned you in.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.700
Your days as a mother,
they're over.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.410
You so much as come
within a city block

00:44.460 --> 00:45.960
of Juliet,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.500
I'll have your
parental rights

00:47.540 --> 00:49.380
stripped so fast,
your head will spin.

00:49.420 --> 00:51.670
Bodaway and his crew,
they're going to be a threat

00:51.710 --> 00:53.300
to you
and your family

00:53.340 --> 00:54.630
until they see
your sister dead.

00:54.670 --> 00:55.840
Get down!

00:57.220 --> 00:58.800
[gunshot]

01:01.260 --> 01:02.970
You're going to tell me
everything you know.

01:03.020 --> 01:04.600
Who's after you?

01:04.640 --> 01:05.810
[phone vibrating]

01:05.850 --> 01:07.020
Yeah?

01:07.060 --> 01:08.230
Hello?

01:11.900 --> 01:13.360
ANDREW: Things with Catherine

01:13.400 --> 01:14.990
couldn't have gone any better.

01:15.030 --> 01:16.990
We recovered every
cent she stole.

01:17.030 --> 01:18.870
And I rather enjoyed
the look on her face

01:18.910 --> 01:20.450
when she realized
she was screwed.

01:20.490 --> 01:22.160
Where are you?

01:22.200 --> 01:24.790
Don't panic.

01:24.830 --> 01:26.540
It happened again.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.330
Someone shot at me.

01:28.370 --> 01:30.840
Oh, my God.
Are you all right?

01:30.880 --> 01:32.090
BRIDGET: I'm fine.

01:32.130 --> 01:34.010
I'm at the police station
on Greene.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.510
But Andrew, whoever's
doing this...

01:36.550 --> 01:38.640
they're not after Bridget.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.010
They're after me.

01:40.050 --> 01:41.890
What?

01:41.930 --> 01:44.640
Look, uh, I'm coming
for you. You stay put.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.100
And, Siobhan...

01:46.140 --> 01:47.560
I love you.

01:47.600 --> 01:49.400
BRIDGET: Me, too.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.400
[opera music playing faintly]

02:00.070 --> 02:02.030
What the hell
are you doing here?

02:03.200 --> 02:07.210
I had to see Juliet.

02:07.250 --> 02:10.630
I think I made
myself very clear.

02:10.670 --> 02:13.630
I don't want you
anywhere near her.

02:13.670 --> 02:17.470
I have to tell her that I am
sorry for what I've done.

02:17.510 --> 02:19.090
For all of it.

02:19.130 --> 02:20.840
[sobbing]

02:20.890 --> 02:22.260
Catherine, this is...

02:24.720 --> 02:26.350
Oh, God.

02:26.390 --> 02:28.690
[sobbing]

02:28.730 --> 02:30.650
What did you do?

02:30.690 --> 02:32.270
I just want to die.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.900
[sobbing]

02:35.940 --> 02:37.690
Gah. Catherine!

[indistinct PA announcements]

03:01.340 --> 03:02.970
Hello, angel.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.520
If this is too much,
we can go.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.320
And of all the crap
you've pulled,

03:17.360 --> 03:19.650
this has to be the lamest.

03:19.690 --> 03:22.950
Pretending to kill yourself
so we'll feel sorry for you?

03:22.990 --> 03:25.240
That's pathetic.

03:25.280 --> 03:28.240
Please, angel.

03:28.290 --> 03:30.120
You have to forgive me.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.330
Forgive you?

03:32.370 --> 03:33.960
No way.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.960
I'm not getting sucked
in again.

03:44.590 --> 03:46.260
Juliet...

03:46.300 --> 03:47.760
You know I'm right.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.520
RAO: Mr. Martin?

03:50.560 --> 03:52.480
I'm Catherine's
psychiatrist--Dr. Rao.

03:52.520 --> 03:54.150
May I speak with
you in private?

03:55.810 --> 03:57.770
Why don't you go
get yourself a snack?

04:03.820 --> 04:05.660
I have a few
questions for you

04:05.700 --> 04:08.080
about Catherine's
medical history.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.660
Has Catherine
ever done

04:09.700 --> 04:11.200
anything
like this before?

04:11.250 --> 04:13.580
Once.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.380
Her doctors
referred to it as...

04:15.420 --> 04:17.340
"parasuicide," I think?

04:17.380 --> 04:19.380
That she never actually
intended to kill herself.

04:19.420 --> 04:21.010
RAO: It's not unusual

04:21.050 --> 04:24.010
for that to precede
a more serious attempt.

04:24.050 --> 04:26.390
Are you saying this
time was different?

04:26.430 --> 04:29.100
Unfortunately, there
was nothing tentative

04:29.140 --> 04:30.470
about the cuts
Catherine made.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.680
If you hadn't found
her when you did,

04:31.720 --> 04:33.270
she would have bled out.

04:33.310 --> 04:35.690
I've been treating Catherine
since she was admitted.

04:35.730 --> 04:37.400
She'll be held here
for two more days

04:37.440 --> 04:38.900
under mandatory
supervision.

04:38.940 --> 04:40.110
Mm-hmm.

04:40.150 --> 04:41.610
But after that,

04:41.650 --> 04:44.820
we have some difficult
decisions to make.

04:44.860 --> 04:47.660
What kind of
difficult decisions?

04:47.700 --> 04:51.120
We could commit her to
a longer stay at Bellevue.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.950
Or we could try to
work out some kind of

04:53.000 --> 04:55.370
a supervised
living situation.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.710
But releasing Catherine
on her own--

04:57.750 --> 04:59.630
right now
that's not an option.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.090
[whistle blows]

05:03.130 --> 05:05.430
[sirens]

05:05.470 --> 05:08.890
This is the fourth time that
you have dragged me in here.

05:08.930 --> 05:11.430
Yes, I was at
the SoHo Diamond

05:11.470 --> 05:13.060
the day Tyler Barrett
was killed.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.140
But I was there
to write.

05:15.180 --> 05:16.940
So, unless you have
anything new to ask me,

05:16.980 --> 05:18.980
I'd like to go home
to my kids.

05:19.020 --> 05:21.270
It's your lucky day,
Mr. Butler.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.530
It turns out new evidence
has come to light.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.070
Well, um...
thank you so much.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.240
Have a good day.

05:33.290 --> 05:36.460
We have a witness that puts
you in Tyler Barrett's room

05:36.500 --> 05:38.000
just before his death.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.060
I really appreciate
you meeting me.

05:59.100 --> 06:00.480
The police won't
tell me anything,

06:00.520 --> 06:02.770
just that they ID'd
the shooter.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.900
Rex Barton.

06:04.940 --> 06:06.820
He's a "family man"
from Jersey.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.910
The bullets we
recovered from his gun

06:08.950 --> 06:11.240
also matched the one they
removed from your husband.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.780
And based on his record,

06:12.830 --> 06:15.120
police believe Barton
was a professional hit man,

06:15.160 --> 06:17.540
which begs the question,
Who hired Barton?

06:17.580 --> 06:19.830
What about that phone call? I
mean, did that lead anywhere?

06:19.870 --> 06:21.460
No, it was a dead end.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.250
Came from a disposable
cell, bought with cash.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.630
Mrs. Martin, do you
have any idea

06:26.670 --> 06:28.300
who might want you dead?

06:29.760 --> 06:31.010
Has the investigation
into Olivia Charles

06:31.050 --> 06:32.470
turned up anything?

06:32.510 --> 06:34.310
"Investigation"?

06:34.350 --> 06:36.310
As far as I know, she's
considered a missing person.

06:36.350 --> 06:38.180
You say missing.

06:38.230 --> 06:40.480
I say she might
be behind it.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.230
You want to tell me why?

06:42.270 --> 06:45.150
Is this about
Martin/Charles?

06:45.190 --> 06:47.070
Do you know what Olivia
was trying to hide?

06:47.110 --> 06:48.530
I wish I did.

06:48.570 --> 06:50.150
Look, if you really
think Olivia's involved,

06:50.200 --> 06:52.410
then you should call
the police.

06:52.450 --> 06:53.990
I'm talking to you.

06:54.030 --> 06:55.540
[laughs]

06:55.580 --> 06:57.540
I'm still on suspension
from the FBI.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.080
And even if I weren't,

06:59.120 --> 07:00.580
I'm here to investigate
Bodaway Macawi.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.420
Your case is
a separate matter.

07:04.210 --> 07:07.170
You asked me last week
if I trusted you.

07:07.210 --> 07:09.760
I said that I did,
and I meant it.

07:09.800 --> 07:12.640
No one has done more
to protect Bridget than you.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.930
Now, on top of it,
you've saved my life?

07:14.970 --> 07:17.970
If anyone can help me,
it's you.

07:20.230 --> 07:22.020
I mean, come on, I know
you must want answers, too.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.780
I have a buddy at the Bureau
that I can check with.

07:28.820 --> 07:30.240
Get an update on the case.

07:30.280 --> 07:32.990
But after that,
Mrs. Martin...

07:33.030 --> 07:34.320
no promises.

07:35.410 --> 07:36.780
Thank you.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.790
Hey, boys?

07:42.830 --> 07:44.460
Daddy's home!

07:44.500 --> 07:47.170
Dash? Becks.

07:47.210 --> 07:48.880
-Henry.
-Hey.

07:48.920 --> 07:51.130
I'm really glad you
were able to post bail.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.880
Yeah, well, I had to
put the brownstone

07:52.930 --> 07:54.840
up for collateral, but...

07:54.890 --> 07:56.260
Hi.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.680
Why is it so quiet in here?

07:57.720 --> 07:59.100
Did Annafried
take the boys out?

08:01.850 --> 08:04.480
I don't know how to
tell you this. I...

08:04.520 --> 08:06.360
I went out earlier
to get some things,

08:06.400 --> 08:10.070
but when I came back,
Annafried was outside.

08:10.110 --> 08:11.280
She was begging them
not to take the boys.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.610
but they
wouldn't listen...

08:12.650 --> 08:13.950
Siobhan, what are you
talking about?

08:13.990 --> 08:15.570
Who took my boys?

08:17.070 --> 08:19.410
Children's Services.

08:19.450 --> 08:21.500
What?

08:25.580 --> 08:29.300
So this Barton guy
shot me at the loft

08:29.340 --> 08:32.130
and then came
after you again?

08:32.170 --> 08:34.630
Look, I know we talked
about Olivia being involved,

08:34.680 --> 08:36.680
but she got away, and
with plenty of money.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.640
This is quite a distance
to go for revenge.

08:39.680 --> 08:41.890
Maybe it's not Olivia.

08:41.930 --> 08:43.850
I don't even know
what to think anymore.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.850
Machado's going
to look into it.

08:46.980 --> 08:49.570
Hey, you.

08:49.610 --> 08:52.240
If you guys are busy,
I can come back.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.280
No. Come on. What's up?

08:59.370 --> 09:02.450
I can't stop thinking
about Mom.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.290
And I heard what
the doctor said...

09:06.330 --> 09:08.460
that she really
meant to kill herself.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.840
Daddy, is this our fault?

09:12.880 --> 09:14.340
I mean, if we
hadn't tricked her...

09:14.380 --> 09:17.090
This is not your fault.

09:17.130 --> 09:18.430
Are you sure?

09:18.470 --> 09:19.800
Yes.

09:24.730 --> 09:28.100
Do you think she's,
like, actually crazy?

09:29.730 --> 09:32.110
I don't know how to
answer that, sweetheart.

09:32.150 --> 09:35.110
But I do know that
she needs help.

09:35.150 --> 09:37.110
And we have to
trust the doctors.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.910
OK.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.660
Juliet, do you want me
to come with you?

09:46.710 --> 09:49.750
And what, tuck me in?

09:49.790 --> 09:51.500
I got it.

09:55.460 --> 09:56.720
[sighs]

09:56.760 --> 09:58.340
This is all my fault.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.390
What are you talking about?

10:02.560 --> 10:05.390
Catherine has done
this before.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.980
When I told her
I wanted a divorce.

10:08.020 --> 10:10.020
It was a cry for attention,
and I left.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.900
Walked away without
a backward glance.

10:11.940 --> 10:13.820
Andrew, that was
a long time ago.

10:13.860 --> 10:15.940
She still holds on
to this fantasy

10:15.990 --> 10:19.740
that we'll get back
together, be a family again.

10:19.780 --> 10:21.530
OK...

10:21.570 --> 10:23.370
Is there more?

10:27.580 --> 10:29.960
Catherine kissed me.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.080
When she was trying
to convince me

10:32.130 --> 10:34.300
to sell the
Palm Springs property,

10:34.340 --> 10:35.920
I thought it was
part of her game,

10:35.960 --> 10:38.760
a little seduction thrown
in to seal the deal.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.430
But what if she
actually thought

10:40.470 --> 10:41.930
the kiss
meant something?

10:41.970 --> 10:43.680
And then I turned
around and told her

10:43.720 --> 10:45.060
I never wanted
to see her again,

10:45.100 --> 10:46.640
and I took her daughter
away from her.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.190
Hey. Anything that
Catherine got

10:49.230 --> 10:52.770
she deserved for
what she put us through.

10:52.810 --> 10:55.520
And... you got
your money back

10:55.570 --> 10:57.190
without implicating Juliet

10:57.230 --> 11:00.450
and without sending
Catherine to jail.

11:00.490 --> 11:02.660
And you never led her on.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.200
Right?

11:04.240 --> 11:05.910
Oh, no, of course not.

11:05.950 --> 11:07.950
I love you.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.960
Well, what do we
do now?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.210
I can't turn my back
like before.

11:15.250 --> 11:16.880
And then
the choices I make,

11:16.920 --> 11:18.420
they don't only
affect Catherine,

11:18.460 --> 11:20.220
they affect Juliet
as well.

11:21.630 --> 11:23.550
You're right.

11:23.590 --> 11:25.220
And as long as
we remember that,

11:25.260 --> 11:27.220
we'll figure it out.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.820
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.690
Did you find out where
they took the boys?

11:39.740 --> 11:41.360
Yeah, they're at
my in-laws',

11:41.400 --> 11:43.240
and they took Annafried
to help ease the transition.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.030
Wait, where are you going?

11:45.070 --> 11:46.780
To make Arbogast
look me in the eye

11:46.830 --> 11:48.660
and tell me what the
hell is going on.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.200
What do you mean?

11:50.250 --> 11:52.460
He's the one who called
Children's Services.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.080
He said I was
an unfit parent.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.000
So first, he turns me in
for murder, and now this.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.050
He's waging war against me,
and I have no idea why.

11:58.090 --> 12:00.260
Wait, Henry. You can't go
to the Arbogasts'. Come on.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.970
The best thing
you could do

12:02.010 --> 12:03.550
right now is
clear your name.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.220
Prove that
you didn't kill Tyler.

12:06.890 --> 12:09.060
And how am I
supposed to do that?

12:09.100 --> 12:10.600
Because in case you
forgot,

12:10.640 --> 12:13.270
I did kill Tyler.

12:13.310 --> 12:16.020
I know.

12:16.060 --> 12:17.730
I know that this
is all my fault.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.650
If I could take
this back, I would.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.660
This one I know I can fix.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.340
SIOBHAN:
Oksana Shegolivich?

12:43.380 --> 12:44.930
I'd like to talk to you

12:44.970 --> 12:46.640
about the day
Tyler Barrett died.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.850
I already told the police
everything I know.

12:48.890 --> 12:50.470
I just want to make sure

12:50.510 --> 12:52.310
you're certain
of the details.

12:52.350 --> 12:53.890
You must see
so many people coming in

12:53.930 --> 12:55.770
and out of here every day.

12:55.810 --> 12:58.810
Picking Henry Butler out
of a crowd can't be easy.

12:58.860 --> 13:02.320
I thought this might help
you see things more clearly.

13:08.410 --> 13:10.370
[horns honking]

13:13.500 --> 13:15.920
This is all fine; it's
just the address is wrong.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.250
Yes, sir.

13:17.290 --> 13:18.830
Ms. Shegolivich.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.590
I didn't know you were
scheduled to come in today.

13:20.630 --> 13:22.130
We need to talk.

13:26.760 --> 13:30.680
[laughing]

13:30.720 --> 13:34.600
Hey, Dash, Becks.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.520
Hey, boys, come here.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.150
Oh...

13:40.190 --> 13:41.940
Boys, lunch.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.490
Ohh... I have
missed you guys.

13:44.530 --> 13:46.700
[Dash giggles]

13:46.740 --> 13:49.450
All right, guys,
go inside. Have some lunch.

13:49.490 --> 13:51.160
WOMAN: Let's go boys. Come on.

13:54.410 --> 13:56.830
You're not supposed
to be here.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.080
So I've been told.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.420
But I don't give a crap.

13:59.460 --> 14:01.170
First, you get me
thrown in jail,

14:01.210 --> 14:03.000
then you take my kids
away from me.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.380
What's left?

14:04.420 --> 14:06.220
Your arrest was your
doing, not mine.

14:06.260 --> 14:07.630
What, so you didn't
call the police

14:07.680 --> 14:09.590
after I gave you
the flash drive?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.600
Andrew Martin is the guy
who's supposed to be in jail.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.180
I was trying to help you.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.180
You lied to me.

14:15.220 --> 14:16.890
You really thought
I'd believe

14:16.930 --> 14:19.350
that you got that
data from Andrew?

14:19.400 --> 14:20.860
It took me all
of two phone calls

14:20.900 --> 14:22.610
to find out that
the S.E.C.

14:22.650 --> 14:24.280
was investigating
Martin/Charles.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.990
Working with
Tyler Barrett,

14:26.030 --> 14:27.530
who coincidentally
was murdered

14:27.570 --> 14:29.240
before he could
hand over his evidence.

14:29.280 --> 14:31.490
I put two and two
together.

14:31.530 --> 14:32.990
What did I
ever do to you, Tim?

14:33.030 --> 14:34.620
Let's start with
all the nights

14:34.660 --> 14:36.290
that my little girl
came to me crying

14:36.330 --> 14:39.620
because she thought you
were cheating on her.

14:39.670 --> 14:43.210
After she died, I tried to
put my suspicions aside,

14:43.250 --> 14:45.960
keep close to you for
the sake of my grandsons.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.090
But when I realized that
you were lying to me

14:48.130 --> 14:49.680
about the flash drive,

14:49.720 --> 14:51.300
I couldn't do it
any longer.

14:51.340 --> 14:53.720
I hired an investigator

14:53.760 --> 14:55.220
to look into
your behavior during

14:55.260 --> 14:57.770
the last year
of Gemma's life.

14:57.810 --> 15:00.390
I know you were sleeping
with Siobhan Martin.

15:02.270 --> 15:05.440
You broke my
daughter's heart.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.940
And for all I know,
you had

15:06.980 --> 15:08.530
something to do
with her death.

15:08.570 --> 15:10.030
No.

15:10.070 --> 15:12.030
There's no talking
yourself out of this.

15:12.070 --> 15:14.950
I'm going
to destroy you.

15:14.990 --> 15:17.200
Whatever it takes,

15:17.240 --> 15:20.460
I will make you and Siobhan
pay for what you did.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.460
Mrs. Martin, thank you
for coming in.

15:28.510 --> 15:30.010
Ah, of course.

15:30.050 --> 15:32.180
I'm not exactly sure
how I can help you.

15:32.220 --> 15:33.720
I've already told you
everything I know

15:33.760 --> 15:35.180
about the attempt
on my life.

15:36.720 --> 15:39.430
That's, uh, not why I called.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.940
I've got questions

15:41.980 --> 15:43.690
concerning the Tyler Barrett
murder case.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.860
I... I don't know
anything about that.

15:51.740 --> 15:54.160
Then why did you
pay a SoHo Diamond maid

15:54.200 --> 15:55.450
to lie about
what she saw

15:55.490 --> 15:57.530
the day that
Tyler was killed?

15:58.870 --> 16:00.700
[nervous chuckle]

16:00.750 --> 16:02.330
Why did I pay a maid?

16:02.370 --> 16:03.870
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

16:03.920 --> 16:07.670
We're aware of your
affair with Henry Butler.

16:07.710 --> 16:09.340
What does my
relationship with Henry

16:09.380 --> 16:10.880
have to do
with any of this?

16:10.920 --> 16:12.720
Ms. Shegolivich is the main
witness in the murder case

16:12.760 --> 16:14.300
against Mr. Butler.

16:14.340 --> 16:16.050
If she recants,
your boyfriend walks.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.390
That sounds like
motive to me.

16:17.430 --> 16:18.970
You arrested Henry?

16:19.010 --> 16:21.100
Yesterday.

16:21.140 --> 16:23.100
Why would Henry
kill Tyler Barrett?

16:23.140 --> 16:25.230
That's what we're
trying to find out.

16:25.270 --> 16:27.310
Tyler Barrett worked
for your husband.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.900
Did you know him?

16:29.940 --> 16:31.940
I only met him once.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.490
It was a business dinner
for Martin/Charles.

16:34.530 --> 16:35.910
Ms. Martin,
is there something

16:35.950 --> 16:37.410
you're not telling me?

16:43.160 --> 16:45.210
Because if you're
hiding something,

16:45.250 --> 16:46.500
we will find it out.

16:57.590 --> 17:00.140
Angel...

17:00.180 --> 17:02.180
is your dad here?

17:02.220 --> 17:03.770
I came by myself.

17:05.390 --> 17:06.940
How are you feeling?

17:08.980 --> 17:12.940
I haven't been on this
many drugs since college.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.610
Not as much fun
as I remember it.

17:15.650 --> 17:18.950
God, you're
a total mess, you know?

17:18.990 --> 17:21.700
And now this doctor's
saying it's not your fault.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.790
That you're sick.

17:25.830 --> 17:28.380
And that almost
makes it worse.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.590
Like you get some pass
for what you've done.

17:33.630 --> 17:35.170
Juliet.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.430
And I should hate you.

17:37.470 --> 17:39.720
The things you made me do,
I lied to everyone.

17:39.760 --> 17:43.220
I made Daddy and Siobhan
believe awful things.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.560
And I did it all because
all I've ever wanted

17:47.600 --> 17:49.860
is for you to want me.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.610
Baby, I am so sorry.

17:51.650 --> 17:53.400
Oh, God.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.190
Like you've never
said that before.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.410
I knew that your dad
would find me.

17:58.450 --> 17:59.870
And I wanted him to
live with the guilt

17:59.910 --> 18:01.410
of knowing that
he caused this.

18:04.660 --> 18:08.210
I have been
an awful mother.

18:13.250 --> 18:16.220
I never actually thought
that I would have kids

18:16.260 --> 18:18.220
until I met your father.

18:19.470 --> 18:22.430
I loved him so much.

18:22.470 --> 18:24.060
And he wanted
kids, so...

18:27.060 --> 18:29.020
And when he left...

18:30.690 --> 18:32.440
I let him take you...

18:34.480 --> 18:37.440
'cause I figured he
loved you more than me.

18:39.280 --> 18:42.740
Then I was alone,

18:42.780 --> 18:44.660
and you were gone.

18:46.120 --> 18:49.670
And all I could do was
obsess about Siobhan.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.880
I hated her.

18:54.920 --> 18:57.010
And I thought that
you felt the same way,

18:57.050 --> 18:59.680
but then the way
you were talking,

18:59.720 --> 19:03.050
I knew that she was
stealing you, too.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.260
And I wanted to take
everything

19:05.310 --> 19:07.310
that mattered
to her:

19:07.350 --> 19:09.390
money...

19:09.430 --> 19:10.980
Andrew...

19:11.020 --> 19:12.190
you.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.360
I messed up so bad.

19:20.530 --> 19:23.490
[sniffles]
I've done things...

19:23.530 --> 19:24.700
things too...

19:24.740 --> 19:26.160
Just stop.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.580
Stop. Because
Daddy's right.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.290
I... It screws me up

19:29.330 --> 19:31.080
to be around you
when you're like this.

19:33.960 --> 19:38.590
Do you want me out
of your life, angel?

19:38.630 --> 19:40.760
Because...

19:40.800 --> 19:43.300
if I lose you...

19:43.340 --> 19:45.720
nothing matters.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.930
You know...

19:48.560 --> 19:50.520
I just want a normal mom.

19:53.350 --> 19:56.110
And if you are sick,

19:56.150 --> 19:58.030
I want you to get better.

19:59.780 --> 20:02.950
But if you're just
an evil bitch,

20:02.990 --> 20:04.570
then get over it.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.700
[TV playing,
billiard balls clacking]

20:14.540 --> 20:16.590
Mr. Osterman,
I'm Agent Cupertino.

20:16.630 --> 20:18.840
This is Agent Machado.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.340
Huh.

20:20.380 --> 20:22.720
You know, I know a joke
that starts like this:

20:22.760 --> 20:25.590
Two FBI agents
walk into a bar,

20:25.640 --> 20:27.680
or should I
make that just one?

20:27.720 --> 20:29.350
If you don't carry
a badge or gun,

20:29.390 --> 20:31.350
you're still an FBI agent?

20:31.390 --> 20:33.350
Well, it didn't stop me

20:33.390 --> 20:35.020
from taking care of your
buddy Rex Barton.

20:35.060 --> 20:36.770
Uh, Barton, no, that
doesn't ring a bell.

20:36.810 --> 20:38.150
That's funny.
He was carrying

20:38.190 --> 20:40.030
a tarot card from
your dry cleaners.

20:40.070 --> 20:42.400
Yeah, I mean, Finer Dry
Cleaners, that was just

20:42.440 --> 20:46.410
such a phenomenal front
for your operation.

20:46.450 --> 20:49.620
[wry chuckle]
My operation?

20:49.660 --> 20:53.250
So you tell me, Mr. Machado,
what was I doing?

20:53.290 --> 20:56.380
Was I laundering money,
dealing drugs?

20:56.420 --> 20:59.040
Well, I think that you were
connecting people,

20:59.090 --> 21:00.800
who wanted someone dead,

21:00.840 --> 21:03.050
with people
who can make it happen.

21:03.090 --> 21:06.090
So, I mean, what, like
a hit man broker?

21:06.130 --> 21:08.180
I know Rex Barton
connects to you.

21:08.220 --> 21:09.970
Which means
you're on the hook

21:10.010 --> 21:11.600
for all the people
he tried to kill.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.060
You tell me who ordered
the hit on Siobhan Martin,

21:14.100 --> 21:15.890
I'll make you a deal:

21:15.940 --> 21:17.810
I'll get you 15 years
instead of life.

21:17.850 --> 21:19.900
Oh, wow, you want
to help me?

21:19.940 --> 21:21.570
With what?

21:21.610 --> 21:23.440
You've got nothing.

21:23.490 --> 21:24.700
[chuckles]

21:27.660 --> 21:29.200
Rex Barton...

21:31.080 --> 21:34.290
Lucky for me,
dead men don't talk.

21:41.840 --> 21:43.800
He didn't deny anything.

21:43.840 --> 21:45.420
He knows who
ordered the hit.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.010
Agreed, but he's right.

21:47.050 --> 21:48.590
We don't have
enough to charge him.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.100
What are you talking about?
What about Rex Barton?

21:50.140 --> 21:51.600
He just called him out
specifically.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.270
There's got to be
something there.

21:53.310 --> 21:54.980
We searched everywhere
except his house.

21:55.020 --> 21:56.560
His wife's fighting us.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.060
We'll get a warrant
eventually, but...

21:58.100 --> 21:59.400
Yeah, she could be the
strong evidence as we speak.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.020
We can't let that happen.

22:01.060 --> 22:04.860
I don't know what to tell
you, Vic. My hands are tied.

22:04.900 --> 22:07.070
Come on.

22:07.110 --> 22:09.070
[horn honks, whistle blows]

22:09.110 --> 22:10.700
[door opens]
HENRY: Hi.

22:10.740 --> 22:11.910
[door closes]

22:13.490 --> 22:16.160
I just got off the
phone with my lawyer.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.670
He said that the hotel
maid changed her story.

22:21.290 --> 22:23.050
I knew I could fix this.

22:23.090 --> 22:24.710
Great job with that.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.180
Because now, on top of
her original accusations,

22:28.220 --> 22:30.140
Oksana Shegolivich is saying

22:30.180 --> 22:32.050
that Siobhan Martin
tried to bribe her.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.720
So now they think
we're working together,

22:33.760 --> 22:35.310
which makes me
look worse!

22:35.350 --> 22:38.020
She reported me?

22:38.060 --> 22:39.520
Yeah.

22:39.560 --> 22:42.270
Henry, this was supposed
to clear you.

22:42.310 --> 22:43.900
Have the police talked
to Bridget?

22:43.940 --> 22:45.360
What?

22:45.400 --> 22:46.650
Well, If the maid accused
"Siobhan,"

22:46.690 --> 22:48.030
then the police are
gonna talk to Bridget.

22:48.070 --> 22:49.240
When that happens,
how long do you think

22:49.280 --> 22:50.910
before she figures out

22:50.950 --> 22:52.700
there's two Siobhan Martins
in New York?

22:52.740 --> 22:54.660
Is that all you
can think about?

22:54.700 --> 22:57.000
I'm trying to protect you.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.710
If the police think that
you're working with Siobhan,

22:58.750 --> 23:00.330
they're gonna add fraud,
embezzlement,

23:00.370 --> 23:02.960
God only knows what else
to your murder charge.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.710
Henry, you have
to find Bridget.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.760
You have to explain this.

23:16.850 --> 23:18.770
WOMAN:
All right, all set?

23:18.810 --> 23:20.100
Yeah.

23:20.140 --> 23:21.980
[car alarm is disarmed]

23:26.400 --> 23:28.360
[car engine starts]

23:54.140 --> 23:56.760
Dad, I have something
to tell you.

23:56.810 --> 24:00.180
I kind of went to go
see Mom today.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.770
Don't be mad.
I just had to see

24:01.810 --> 24:03.770
if she was faking it
or if she--

24:03.810 --> 24:06.110
Sweetheart, I don't think
we're ever gonna know

24:06.150 --> 24:07.860
what's going on inside
your mother's head.

24:07.900 --> 24:10.780
But they want
to institutionalize her.

24:10.820 --> 24:12.240
Do you think that's fair?

24:12.280 --> 24:16.780
It's not to punish her,
it's to help her.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.580
I know it's not ideal,

24:18.620 --> 24:20.330
but we have to be
practical.

24:20.370 --> 24:21.830
What if we hired a nurse?

24:21.870 --> 24:23.170
We set the the two of them
up in an apartment?

24:23.210 --> 24:24.880
I talked to the doctor
about it.

24:24.920 --> 24:28.590
I even got some names:
Pauline...

24:28.630 --> 24:30.380
Your mother
gets out tomorrow.

24:30.420 --> 24:33.130
I know. So maybe, at first,
she could stay here with us.

24:33.180 --> 24:34.590
Just until we
hire someone.

24:34.630 --> 24:36.300
No, I don't want her
around you.

24:36.340 --> 24:37.800
Not like that.

24:37.850 --> 24:40.600
I know, Dad, but if we just
send her away like that,

24:40.640 --> 24:42.350
I don't know
if I can live with myself.

24:44.060 --> 24:46.400
OK, please, Daddy?

24:46.440 --> 24:48.230
Please just think
about it, OK?

25:31.150 --> 25:32.400
[scraping noise]

26:35.420 --> 26:36.920
[knocking]

26:36.970 --> 26:38.680
Annafried,
is that you?

26:38.720 --> 26:40.720
I need to talk
to Henry.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.350
I can see you.

27:01.570 --> 27:02.740
Hello?

27:13.460 --> 27:14.750
Henry?

27:20.340 --> 27:21.970
Annafried?

27:34.230 --> 27:36.270
Hey.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.400
What are you doing
in my house?

27:40.320 --> 27:41.530
HENRY: You know what?

27:41.570 --> 27:43.700
I was actually looking
for you, too.

27:43.740 --> 27:45.280
Oh, did it have something
to do with me being hauled

27:45.330 --> 27:46.790
into the police station?

27:46.830 --> 27:49.040
Why the hell
did they arrest you?

27:49.080 --> 27:51.040
I'm sorry that you got
mixed up in that.

27:51.080 --> 27:54.580
The maid, she told the
police that she let me into

27:54.630 --> 27:56.090
Tyler Barrett's room
the day that he was murdered.

27:56.130 --> 27:58.460
She's lying, of course,
but I panicked.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.840
And so I,

27:59.880 --> 28:01.470
I thought she wanted money,

28:01.510 --> 28:03.680
so I hired a woman
to pay her off.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.720
And the woman I hired
happened to be a blond,

28:05.760 --> 28:07.600
and I guess because
of our relationship,

28:07.640 --> 28:10.730
the police assumed
that it was you.

28:10.770 --> 28:12.230
We don't have
a relationship.

28:12.270 --> 28:13.560
You need to tell
the police

28:13.600 --> 28:15.060
that whatever we had
is long over.

28:15.110 --> 28:17.020
I have no reason
to bribe anyone.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.320
HENRY: I know,
I know. Well, I mean,

28:18.360 --> 28:20.110
they're not listening
to me right now,

28:20.150 --> 28:22.530
but I will do everything
that I can.

28:22.570 --> 28:26.410
Wait. If the maid clearly
didn't want money,

28:26.450 --> 28:27.910
why would she lie?

28:27.950 --> 28:31.750
[chuckles]
I wish I knew.

28:33.290 --> 28:34.920
It's funny.
I keep wondering

28:34.960 --> 28:36.580
what you were doing
at the hotel that day.

28:36.630 --> 28:38.500
Yeah, I was there writing.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.630
I had no idea that
Tyler was staying there.

28:41.670 --> 28:44.220
You knew.

28:44.260 --> 28:46.430
You knew
about Tyler and me.

28:46.470 --> 28:50.770
Wha--You and Tyler? Come on.

28:50.810 --> 28:52.890
Are you serious?

28:52.930 --> 28:55.690
Oh, my God, Henry.

28:55.730 --> 28:57.980
You did kill Tyler.

28:58.020 --> 28:59.570
It's written all
over your face.

28:59.610 --> 29:02.150
Knock it off.
I didn't kill anybody.

29:03.650 --> 29:05.360
OK, you know what?

29:05.410 --> 29:09.530
I-I need you to leave
my house now, please.

29:09.580 --> 29:11.660
I know you're
hiding something.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.880
[door opens, then closes]

29:27.800 --> 29:30.100
I really appreciate
you coming over here.

29:30.140 --> 29:32.020
Just one of those days
I couldn't get away.

29:32.060 --> 29:34.640
No problem. I just
have a couple of things
I need to show you. Oh.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.270
Hi.

29:36.310 --> 29:37.770
Juliet, you remember
Agent Machado?

29:37.810 --> 29:39.520
JULIET: Mm-hmm.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.650
And this is Catherine,
Juliet's mother.

29:41.690 --> 29:43.610
She's staying with us.

29:43.650 --> 29:46.070
Oh. Why don't we head
to my room, Juliet,

29:46.110 --> 29:48.200
and give Siobhan
some privacy?

29:48.240 --> 29:50.910
JULIET:
And, Mom, um...

29:50.950 --> 29:52.700
don't forget
these.

29:52.740 --> 29:54.700
-Oh.
-Here.

29:56.370 --> 29:58.420
It's enough
to tranquilize a horse.

30:01.540 --> 30:02.960
You OK?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.170
Oh, yeah. No, I mean...

30:05.220 --> 30:06.930
I know it's just
the first day,

30:06.970 --> 30:08.590
but she's doing everything
the doctor said.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.350
She's, like,
taking her pills

30:10.390 --> 30:13.520
and is even going
to therapy tonight.

30:13.560 --> 30:16.140
Am I crazy to think things
might be getting better now?

30:17.770 --> 30:19.440
Not a bit.

30:21.150 --> 30:23.440
-Bye.
-Bye.

30:25.610 --> 30:27.740
Come on in.

30:27.780 --> 30:29.660
You're a good mother,
Mrs. Martin

30:29.700 --> 30:31.240
and, apparently,
a very good wife

30:31.280 --> 30:33.370
to let your husband's ex
stay with you.

30:33.410 --> 30:37.080
That's only for
a few days. Long story.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.710
You have something
to show me?

30:38.750 --> 30:40.380
Yeah. I found
some things

30:40.420 --> 30:43.040
that might relate
to your case.

30:43.090 --> 30:44.800
Recognize this?

30:44.840 --> 30:46.590
I found the original in
Rex Barton's basement.

30:48.630 --> 30:49.800
[groans]

30:56.220 --> 30:59.310
Uh, this was our Christmas
card a few years ago.

30:59.350 --> 31:01.980
The missing half is me.

31:02.020 --> 31:04.400
Why would Rex Barton
have that?

31:04.440 --> 31:07.320
Well, my guess is,
whoever wants you dead

31:07.360 --> 31:10.360
gave it to a mobster
named Remy Osterman.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.030
Osterman then
contracted out the hit

31:12.070 --> 31:15.030
using the rest
of that photo for I.D.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.790
I have something else.

31:30.340 --> 31:31.720
Oh, my God.

31:31.760 --> 31:33.800
You know him?

31:37.680 --> 31:39.890
Agent Machado,
you know that I trust you.

31:39.930 --> 31:41.100
Do you trust me?

31:41.140 --> 31:43.060
Who is he?

31:43.100 --> 31:45.020
Please, if I'm going to be
completely honest with you,

31:45.060 --> 31:46.860
then I just need to know
that you're on my side.

31:46.900 --> 31:48.820
Go on.

31:51.860 --> 31:54.450
I do know him.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.870
I know him
because I killed him.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.510
What are you doing?

32:16.100 --> 32:19.060
Henry, please
don't shut me out.

32:19.100 --> 32:20.480
Talk to me.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.770
About what, Siobhan?
My life is ruined.

32:23.810 --> 32:26.270
And it all started when
I got mixed up with you.

32:26.310 --> 32:28.570
I have made
these choices.

32:28.610 --> 32:31.530
I killed a man.
I can't take that back.

32:31.570 --> 32:34.110
It's all because
I love you.

32:34.160 --> 32:35.700
Hell, I'm so crazy
in love with you

32:35.740 --> 32:37.200
that I tried
to help you set up

32:37.240 --> 32:38.870
your own sister to die.

32:38.910 --> 32:43.160
Now, you told me that you
were done with all this.

32:43.210 --> 32:45.210
That's obviously not
the truth, so tell me,

32:45.250 --> 32:47.630
where the hell
does this end?

32:47.670 --> 32:50.000
Let's just end it now.

32:50.050 --> 32:51.880
I mean, we have
Andrew's money.

32:51.920 --> 32:53.130
I'll go anywhere you want.

32:54.590 --> 32:57.800
I don't care about
revenge if I lose you.

33:00.930 --> 33:02.230
No...

33:03.560 --> 33:06.100
it's too late.

33:06.150 --> 33:07.860
I'm not gonna leave
my boys.

33:09.360 --> 33:12.280
And don't try to
fix anything else.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.110
'Cause every time you do,
things just get worse.

33:20.950 --> 33:22.620
MACHADO: OK, this, uh,

33:22.660 --> 33:26.170
this changes things
just a little bit.

33:26.210 --> 33:27.750
You're going to start
from the beginning.

33:27.790 --> 33:29.920
And you're going
to tell me everything.

33:29.960 --> 33:34.470
This is the man who tried
to kill me, not Rex Barton.

33:34.510 --> 33:36.300
I didn't tell you because...

33:36.340 --> 33:38.260
I...killed him.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.220
In self-defense.

33:40.260 --> 33:42.430
And then I hid the body

33:42.470 --> 33:44.350
just till I could figure out
what I was gonna do.

33:44.390 --> 33:47.900
But then I went back,
and it was gone.

33:47.940 --> 33:49.650
So you're telling me
you killed a man,

33:49.690 --> 33:52.110
and then the body
just disappeared?

33:52.150 --> 33:54.780
Well, no...Rex Barton
took it.

33:54.820 --> 33:56.110
That's why I didn't go
to the police.

33:56.150 --> 33:58.030
He was holding it over me.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.870
You know, you're gonna have
to explain a few things now

33:59.910 --> 34:02.870
because my visit to Barton's
wasn't exactly authorized,

34:02.910 --> 34:04.620
but the FBI,
they will get a warrant.

34:04.660 --> 34:06.250
And when they
run forensics,

34:06.290 --> 34:07.620
the bullet in this
body right here

34:07.670 --> 34:08.830
is going to trace
to you.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.790
Actually, to Bridget.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.380
She gave me the gun.

34:12.420 --> 34:13.590
I didn't want it,

34:13.630 --> 34:15.420
but it wound up
saving my life.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.090
And then I gave it
to someone

34:17.130 --> 34:20.010
that I thought I could
trust to get rid of it:

34:20.050 --> 34:21.390
John Delario.

34:24.770 --> 34:26.350
That's how John Delario
got the gun

34:26.390 --> 34:28.350
he used
to kill Gemma Butler?

34:28.390 --> 34:30.610
Yeah.

34:30.650 --> 34:32.730
OK.
[laughs]

34:32.770 --> 34:35.320
So if this guy came
after you first,
then what, then?

34:35.360 --> 34:37.950
Osterman contracted
your hit to him?

34:37.990 --> 34:39.990
And when he went missing,
Osterman then called Barton

34:40.030 --> 34:42.410
to clean up the mess
and finish the job?

34:42.450 --> 34:43.990
But Barton
couldn't finish it.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.660
I want the phone.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.080
BRIDGET, VOICE-OVER: I took
a phone off the dead man.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.370
Barton wanted the phone.

34:48.410 --> 34:49.580
I knew it, and I knew

34:49.620 --> 34:51.170
that it could keep me safe.

34:51.210 --> 34:53.540
Why would Barton want
a phone that wasn't his?

34:53.590 --> 34:55.130
Anything in it
would just trace back

34:55.170 --> 34:57.880
to the guy you killed.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.840
Or maybe to the person
who ordered the hit.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.470
You still have
the phone?

35:01.510 --> 35:03.350
[sighs]
No, it was stolen.

35:03.390 --> 35:05.390
Right before
Andrew got shot.

35:05.430 --> 35:07.430
I mean, it was
here in the house;
it was just in my closet,

35:07.480 --> 35:09.640
and then one day
it was gone.

35:09.690 --> 35:12.480
So whoever took the phone
had access to your house.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.520
Which means, most likely,
Barton didn't take it.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.030
The person who
hired him did.

35:16.070 --> 35:18.030
Which brings us back
to the original question:

35:18.070 --> 35:19.650
Who wants to kill me?

35:22.030 --> 35:23.240
[sighs]

35:23.280 --> 35:24.950
That photo I found
at Barton's--

35:24.990 --> 35:26.790
the original one
of this--

35:26.830 --> 35:28.870
I asked a friend to
run it for prints.

35:28.910 --> 35:30.670
It's a long shot,
but if the person

35:30.710 --> 35:32.250
who ordered
the hit touched it,

35:32.290 --> 35:34.670
there's a chance we can
find out who wants you dead.

35:50.730 --> 35:53.270
So whoever took the phone
had access to your house.

36:01.950 --> 36:03.240
[sighs]

36:06.410 --> 36:09.330
[rummaging through drawer]

36:09.370 --> 36:10.540
[gasps]

36:10.580 --> 36:12.670
Looking for this?

36:12.710 --> 36:15.000
I just figured sharp things
were a no-go for Mom,

36:15.040 --> 36:17.300
just in case.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.090
I'll lock it up
afterwards.

36:19.130 --> 36:20.420
OK.

36:22.970 --> 36:24.760
[sighs]

36:24.800 --> 36:25.970
[closes drawer]

36:32.560 --> 36:34.940
Mr. Arbogast,

36:34.980 --> 36:36.650
my assistant told me
you were here.

36:36.690 --> 36:38.150
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

36:38.190 --> 36:39.820
We need to talk, Andrew.

36:43.150 --> 36:44.990
I don't know where
you got that, but...

36:45.030 --> 36:46.620
Yes, you do.

36:46.660 --> 36:49.700
It belonged
to Tyler Barrett.

36:49.740 --> 36:52.620
My former son-in-law
gave it to me.

36:52.660 --> 36:54.290
He assumed I'd go
to the authorities,

36:54.330 --> 36:57.000
turn you in for fraud.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.790
But I'm not going
to do that.

36:58.840 --> 37:03.510
Instead, I'm going to save
Martin/Charles.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.140
-You're going out?
-Yeah.

37:10.180 --> 37:12.520
My mom asked me to grab
some stuff from her hotel.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.890
Give me a second. I can get
my coat and go with you.

37:14.940 --> 37:17.150
I think it's probably best
if you stay here with her.

37:17.190 --> 37:18.650
Is that cool?

37:18.690 --> 37:20.110
-No problem.
-OK.

37:24.200 --> 37:26.410
Do you mind if
I make myself some tea?

37:27.870 --> 37:30.580
Of course not.
Be my guest.

37:30.620 --> 37:33.250
You care to join me?

37:33.290 --> 37:35.250
I'm... good.
Thank you.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.130
I get it.

37:38.170 --> 37:40.340
We never got along under
the best of circumstances,

37:40.380 --> 37:44.220
and after everything
that I've done,

37:44.260 --> 37:45.880
I wouldn't want to spend
time with me either.

37:49.640 --> 37:52.810
Catherine, actually,
tea sounds great.

37:52.850 --> 37:54.600
I'd love to join you.

38:48.280 --> 38:49.530
No.

39:01.710 --> 39:03.920
[sighs]
I forgot the sugar.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.590
I'll get it; you stay.

39:10.130 --> 39:11.590
[line ringing]

39:11.640 --> 39:13.220
Come on. Come on.

39:13.260 --> 39:15.310
[phone ringing]

39:19.390 --> 39:20.560
[beep]

39:23.150 --> 39:24.900
Was that my phone?

39:24.940 --> 39:26.400
I didn't hear anything.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.150
Oh. Here.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.950
Thanks.

39:32.620 --> 39:33.780
Thank you.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.290
BRIDGET: Leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.290
[beep]

39:44.340 --> 39:45.630
[line ringing]

40:02.230 --> 40:03.940
Juliet's been gone a while.

40:03.980 --> 40:05.520
Maybe I should check on her.

40:05.560 --> 40:08.070
She probably just went
for some coffee.

40:08.110 --> 40:10.740
I'd just feel better
if I did.

40:10.780 --> 40:12.780
Oh.

40:15.620 --> 40:17.200
[distorted]
Are you all right?

40:18.950 --> 40:20.540
That was weird.

40:20.580 --> 40:22.160
I, um...head rush.

40:22.210 --> 40:23.460
Uh, no, I'm fine.

40:23.500 --> 40:26.750
Um...stressful week.

40:41.310 --> 40:42.940
[exhales sharply]

40:51.400 --> 40:54.200
That's not mine.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.990
Wait. Is that...?

41:04.960 --> 41:06.540
So whoever
took the phone

41:06.580 --> 41:09.210
ordered the hit.

41:09.250 --> 41:12.130
You have any idea who
might want you dead?

41:14.050 --> 41:15.430
[gasps and groans]

41:20.260 --> 41:22.850
Find what
you're looking for?

41:24.440 --> 41:26.150
It's you.
