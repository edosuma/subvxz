WEBVTT

00:00.752 --> 00:02.718
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Hi.

00:02.787 --> 00:03.886
Max, how'd you sleep?

00:03.953 --> 00:06.355
Oh, I love crashing here!

00:06.424 --> 00:08.431
This is just like college...

00:08.466 --> 00:11.284
staying up too late,
passing out on the couch,

00:11.319 --> 00:13.238
mean Asian chick down the hall.

00:13.273 --> 00:14.559
Yeah. Where is Lily?

00:14.594 --> 00:16.315
I don't know. S-School, maybe?

00:16.350 --> 00:18.035
- I'm right here.
- Oh.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.503
We met Max in Amsterdam
on what we thought

00:21.571 --> 00:24.372
was a tour of pottery cafes, so...

00:24.441 --> 00:26.708
I don't remember much about it,
but I do remember thinking

00:26.776 --> 00:29.010
he was the funniest person
I've ever met.

00:29.048 --> 00:30.982
And we told him
if he ever came into town,

00:31.050 --> 00:34.785
that he had to stay with us.
And I-I-I'm so glad he said yes

00:34.820 --> 00:37.106
because I remember
being really, uh, paranoid

00:37.141 --> 00:38.146
that he didn't like me.

00:39.099 --> 00:40.899
You two, get out of here.

00:40.968 --> 00:42.234
I'm gonna whip us up some breakfast.

00:42.303 --> 00:43.735
Oh!

00:43.804 --> 00:45.037
Oof.

00:45.105 --> 00:47.906
Whoo! My head feels like the Hindenburg.

00:47.975 --> 00:50.676
Oh, come on!

00:50.744 --> 00:52.622
I feel like he was funnier in Europe.

00:52.647 --> 00:54.713
Yeah.

00:54.782 --> 00:56.248
Mitchell! Look!

00:56.317 --> 00:58.183
Our crazy-expensive bottle of wine?

00:58.252 --> 01:00.619
I... uh, we were saving this for the
perfect occasion.

01:00.688 --> 01:04.388
Okay, well, he must've drank it
after we went to bed. Who does that?

01:04.458 --> 01:07.859
Just drinks somebody's most
expensive bottle of wine without asking?

01:07.928 --> 01:09.461
- Okay, it's a hate crime.
- How is it a hate crime?

01:09.530 --> 01:10.896
Because I hate him.

01:10.965 --> 01:13.398
I ca... I can't
believe it's almost gone.

01:13.467 --> 01:15.867
Look, you know, I've only ever
considered opening that twice...

01:15.936 --> 01:17.169
once early
on election night

01:17.237 --> 01:18.971
and then when we thought
"La La Land" won Best Picture.

01:19.039 --> 01:21.306
- I know. It's been a rough year.
- MAX: Breakfast!

01:23.610 --> 01:25.310
No, no.

01:25.379 --> 01:26.379
Is that our caviar?

01:26.447 --> 01:29.514
Yeah! Lucky I found it.
It was hiding in the back of the fridge.

01:29.583 --> 01:31.049
For a special occasion.

01:31.118 --> 01:33.185
- Something wrong?
- Yeah... yeah.

01:33.253 --> 01:35.420
Uh, first you open up
our $400 bottle of wine,

01:35.489 --> 01:37.856
now it's our $200 tin of caviar.

01:37.925 --> 01:39.591
- We were saving those.
- For what?

01:39.660 --> 01:41.126
A celebration, like...

01:41.195 --> 01:42.627
What about when
"Moonlight" won the Oscar?

01:42.696 --> 01:44.663
Okay, it was a big moment
for the community, yes...

01:44.732 --> 01:47.599
Okay, you know what? Look.
I'm gonna go, okay?

01:47.668 --> 01:51.003
But, guys, don't defer enjoyment,

01:51.071 --> 01:53.538
'cause you never know when
you're gonna bite it.

01:53.607 --> 01:56.641
I say, make every night special.

01:56.710 --> 01:58.977
Okay, well, that's a...
that's a fun philosophy,

01:59.046 --> 02:00.312
but not everyone can follow that, okay?

02:00.381 --> 02:02.114
'Cause... 'Cause we have
responsibilities.

02:02.182 --> 02:05.150
We have... We have budgets.
We have a daughter, you know.

02:05.219 --> 02:06.385
Where is our daughter?

02:06.453 --> 02:08.053
- I don't know. Backyard, maybe?
- Maybe.

02:20.934 --> 02:25.370
Earl Chambers, my former business
partner-turned dumbass nemesis,

02:25.439 --> 02:27.372
bought the old horizontal wardrobe.

02:27.441 --> 02:30.075
For you closet non-pros,
that means he died.

02:30.144 --> 02:34.179
Then last week, I received
this urn and this note.

02:34.248 --> 02:38.283
"You know what to do with my ashes.
Follow the path."

02:38.352 --> 02:40.419
What the hell does that mean?

02:40.487 --> 02:43.121
You think you can drive me nuts,
but you can't.

02:43.190 --> 02:45.657
He can't actually hear you
unless you open the lid.

02:45.726 --> 02:47.893
I still can't figure out
the meaning of "Follow the path!"

02:47.961 --> 02:49.361
I'm gonna need you to call Shirl

02:49.430 --> 02:51.530
and find out why her father's
been torturing me.

02:51.598 --> 02:53.331
- You call her!
- That's not an option.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.600
She's a greasy slimebucket,
just like her father,

02:55.669 --> 02:57.269
and for some reason,
she doesn't like me.

02:57.337 --> 02:59.504
Hmm... I'll see what I can do.

03:06.780 --> 03:08.413
Oh...

03:08.482 --> 03:10.415
Hey, Manny! What's up?

03:10.484 --> 03:11.917
I'm not here! Everything's fine!

03:11.985 --> 03:14.386
- Super-dupes.
- Okay, I'll... I'll... I'll talk.

03:14.455 --> 03:17.289
Luke and I went to a sketchy
neighborhood for tacos last night,

03:17.357 --> 03:19.424
and he disappeared,
and I haven't seen him since.

03:19.493 --> 03:21.126
What? Where did you see him last?

03:21.195 --> 03:22.360
He went off with this girl.

03:22.379 --> 03:23.395
- With a girl?
- Yeah.

03:23.464 --> 03:25.530
Manny.

03:25.599 --> 03:27.766
Let me tell you a little
something about Dunphy men.

03:27.835 --> 03:29.534
When we come into contact with a lady,

03:29.603 --> 03:31.236
we leave her with a burning sensation.

03:31.305 --> 03:32.704
Let me try that again.

03:32.773 --> 03:35.707
Um... when a Dunphy man
sees a sexy skirt,

03:35.776 --> 03:36.942
he's just gotta get in it.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.243
- No!
- I get the point.

03:38.312 --> 03:39.978
Look, I'm just glad you came to me...

03:40.047 --> 03:41.580
I didn't. You caught me here.

03:41.648 --> 03:43.949
...'cause I don't want Claire
freaking out about this.

03:44.017 --> 03:46.051
Luke's phone is going
straight to voicemail.

03:47.187 --> 03:49.054
Someone's got a sock
on the digital doorknob.

03:49.123 --> 03:51.289
I really think you should be
a little worried about this.

03:51.358 --> 03:52.557
Worried?!

03:52.626 --> 03:54.092
Let me tell you something
about Dunphy men.

03:54.161 --> 03:56.595
Phil, this was
a pretty rough neighborhood.

03:56.663 --> 03:58.897
Tell you what,
if it makes you feel better,

03:58.966 --> 04:00.465
we'll go down there
and look around for him.

04:00.534 --> 04:03.001
We're gonna need backup...
serious backup.

04:05.005 --> 04:06.605
Okay, be cool.

04:06.673 --> 04:08.206
I used to live in this neighborhood.

04:08.275 --> 04:10.542
If you act tough,
nobody will mess with you.

04:11.945 --> 04:12.945
MAN: Hey!

04:14.615 --> 04:15.714
Would you like to try

04:15.782 --> 04:17.949
a cruelty-free
alkaline-water snow cone?

04:18.017 --> 04:19.517
- What?
- Free sample.

04:19.586 --> 04:21.086
You can get a larger one
down at our stand.

04:21.154 --> 04:22.287
We also refurbish tubas.

04:22.356 --> 04:23.855
No, thank you.

04:23.924 --> 04:25.624
What happened to my neighborhood?

04:25.692 --> 04:27.392
Have the best day.

04:28.428 --> 04:31.563
White people with beards...
they ruined everything.

04:31.632 --> 04:34.032
Why would you even say that
this place was dangerous?

04:34.101 --> 04:36.801
It was a lot scarier at dark.
There was jazz.

04:38.972 --> 04:40.338
Luke's still not answering.

04:40.407 --> 04:41.907
We're gonna find him, Phil.

04:41.975 --> 04:43.675
Oh, I-I'm not worried. I've been there.

04:43.744 --> 04:45.877
Meet a girl, you lose track
of place and time,

04:45.946 --> 04:47.546
not just 'cause your
compass watch is missing,

04:47.614 --> 04:49.514
and suddenly her cousin Rodney
has the exact same watch

04:49.583 --> 04:50.815
but swears it was always his.

04:50.884 --> 04:53.185
Oh, look! Mario's Bodyshop.

04:53.253 --> 04:55.720
At least one thing is still the same.

04:55.791 --> 04:57.491
There's nothing that happens
in this street

04:57.559 --> 04:59.159
that Mario doesn't know about.

04:59.228 --> 05:00.528
Let's go over there.

05:01.799 --> 05:04.767
So, red lights are flashing,
alarms are blaring.

05:04.836 --> 05:08.204
We're about 10 seconds
from a meltdown so hot

05:08.272 --> 05:11.140
it's gonna turn Belgium
into a pool of hot chocolate.

05:11.209 --> 05:12.842
And I suddenly realize,

05:12.910 --> 05:15.478
they haven't properly accounted
for the relativistic distort...

05:15.546 --> 05:16.912
Hey, what's this building's number?

05:16.981 --> 05:18.747
- I'm trying to Postmates a smoothie.
- Shh!

05:18.765 --> 05:22.667
I quickly do a few multi-dimensional
tensor calculations in my head,

05:22.736 --> 05:26.804
I push this crying guard to one side
and adjust the synchrotron.

05:27.181 --> 05:29.214
I look up at the countdown clock.

05:29.283 --> 05:30.416
5...

05:30.484 --> 05:31.617
4...

05:35.156 --> 05:37.990
You, with the phone!

05:38.059 --> 05:39.958
- What's your name?
- Alex Dunphy.

05:40.027 --> 05:42.461
Ms. Dunphy, is my story
of saving the world

05:42.530 --> 05:46.798
whilst accidently creating
three new elements boring you?

05:46.808 --> 05:49.208
Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
I'm so sorry, Professor.

05:49.277 --> 05:50.810
Nothing you could say
would ever bore me.

05:50.879 --> 05:52.045
I revere you.

05:52.113 --> 05:54.113
I actually went as you
last year for Halloween.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.849
Okay, it's my phone.
Don't blame my sister.

05:56.918 --> 05:59.585
Hey, Chelsea.
Gonna have to call you back.

05:59.654 --> 06:02.121
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Shut up!

06:02.190 --> 06:04.123
Excuse me, Chelsea's friend.

06:04.192 --> 06:06.092
Y-You don't look like
one of my students.

06:06.161 --> 06:08.628
Oh, thank you! That is so sweet.

06:08.697 --> 06:10.396
No. Why are you here?

06:10.465 --> 06:12.265
Oh, I have a really big
job interview today,

06:12.333 --> 06:14.367
and I need someone
to look over what I wrote for my...

06:14.436 --> 06:16.703
Yeah, we're going.
I'm taking her out. I am so sorry.

06:16.771 --> 06:19.541
What? He asked. You're being rude.

06:19.808 --> 06:20.808
Ohh!

06:20.875 --> 06:22.875
Ooh.

06:22.944 --> 06:24.444
- Very revealing.
- Get out.

06:25.974 --> 06:27.543
Claire, I'm so glad
you called.

06:27.663 --> 06:29.106
How come we've never
done this before?

06:29.263 --> 06:30.464
Because we were born
into a feud.

06:30.584 --> 06:32.794
Hatfields and McCoys,
the Sharks and Jets,

06:32.930 --> 06:36.072
the... the closet lunatic
and the closet idiot.

06:36.263 --> 06:38.513
By the way, I'm really
sorry about your dad.

06:38.538 --> 06:39.563
Thanks.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.486
Do you have any idea why he
had his ashes sent to my dad?

06:42.521 --> 06:44.803
- Probably to drive him bonkers.
- Well, it's working.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.137
That would've made him happy.

06:46.206 --> 06:49.451
Let's make a pact...
to never be like them.

06:49.486 --> 06:50.777
- I am in.
- Mm-hmm.

06:50.812 --> 06:52.928
We are two women in
a male-dominated industry.

06:52.963 --> 06:54.351
We should help each other.

06:54.386 --> 06:58.002
Actually, do you have any sources
for antique pineapple knobs?

06:58.037 --> 06:59.816
We're doing this whole colonial line...

06:59.851 --> 07:02.215
Ooh, I bet you Lazlo would know.
He's our lead designer.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.929
Everybody knows who Lazlo is.
He's a legend.

07:04.964 --> 07:06.837
Yeah, and my only employee worth a damn.

07:06.872 --> 07:08.922
Robot workers. Now, that's the future.

07:08.957 --> 07:10.743
Right! They work 24/7,

07:10.778 --> 07:12.766
and you don't have to
buy them a birthday cake.

07:12.801 --> 07:14.235
Yeah, and as they become more human,

07:14.270 --> 07:16.266
you can be like, "Hey, you,
come into my office",

07:16.301 --> 07:18.948
- and then you just go to town on them.
- Yeah.

07:20.412 --> 07:22.813
What the hell?

07:22.881 --> 07:24.581
What happened to the bodyshop?

07:24.650 --> 07:25.982
Oh, we just kept the sign.

07:26.051 --> 07:28.218
Oh, uh, so... so no M-Mario?

07:28.287 --> 07:30.520
Mnh-mnh. We're an artist collective.

07:30.589 --> 07:31.888
Jillian works in yarn,

07:31.957 --> 07:35.592
Mumford sculpts with Lego,
Duncan is a painter.

07:35.661 --> 07:36.661
May I write you a poem?

07:36.728 --> 07:39.429
- Are you kidding me?
- I told you it was a career.

07:39.511 --> 07:42.979
Um, any chance that
you have, uh, seen my son?

07:43.047 --> 07:44.280
No, I'm sorry.

07:44.349 --> 07:46.315
Oh, okay. He... He was
around here last night.

07:46.342 --> 07:48.342
He apparently wentoff with a girl
from this neighborhood.

07:48.410 --> 07:49.877
We just haven't been able
to reach him since.

07:49.945 --> 07:53.013
- Do you know the girl's name?
- No. Uh, something Latin-y.

07:53.082 --> 07:56.049
What happened to you?
You used to be Latin-y.

07:56.118 --> 07:59.652
- Can you describe her?
- Brown hair, high cheekbones...

07:59.732 --> 08:03.100
What is he gonna do,
build her out of Legos?

08:04.570 --> 08:07.471
Huh, that is surprisingly effective.

08:07.540 --> 08:09.540
Wait a minute. I know that girl.

08:09.609 --> 08:11.442
I think she works at a cupcake shop.

08:11.511 --> 08:13.043
Great. Where is it?

08:13.100 --> 08:15.000
Well, I'm not sure which one
because we have four.

08:15.069 --> 08:17.069
There's Cupcakes! with
an exclamation point,

08:17.137 --> 08:18.870
there's vegan cupcakes at Cupfakes,

08:18.939 --> 08:20.872
there's Pupcakes,
which sells cupcakes for dogs,

08:20.941 --> 08:22.876
and then there's Rick's VCR Repair.

08:22.911 --> 08:25.072
Oh, they make the best cupcakes.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.377
Stupid Max, forcing us to eat our caviar

08:27.446 --> 08:29.212
on a regular Friday morning.

08:29.281 --> 08:30.847
I can't even enjoy
the symphony of flavors,

08:30.916 --> 08:32.881
or the... or the way
that it melts in my mouth.

08:32.951 --> 08:35.051
Why don't you just wash it down
with whatever wine's left.

08:35.120 --> 08:36.120
Yeah, why don't I.

08:36.188 --> 08:37.352
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

08:39.089 --> 08:40.621
Mmm, and, of course, you know what?

08:40.691 --> 08:42.123
It pairs perfectly.

08:42.192 --> 08:45.427
I-I cannot believe I'm having one of the
best meals of my life

08:45.495 --> 08:46.795
and we're not even celebrating anything.

08:46.863 --> 08:47.996
Yeah, thanks, Max!

08:48.065 --> 08:49.631
- Thank you, Max.
- Thank you, Max.

08:50.901 --> 08:51.901
Mmm...

08:54.137 --> 08:56.071
Cam, is it... is it... is it possible

08:56.139 --> 08:57.806
that we're actually enjoying ourselves

08:57.874 --> 08:59.540
and... and that Max was right?

08:59.584 --> 09:01.050
Maybe we do defer enjoyment.

09:01.119 --> 09:03.019
All those unspent frequent flyer miles,

09:03.088 --> 09:04.654
the boots that
I have waited so long to wear

09:04.722 --> 09:05.988
that they're no longer in style,

09:06.057 --> 09:08.057
the... the... the surfboards

09:08.159 --> 09:09.849
that we've never used because it just

09:09.874 --> 09:11.494
"had to be the perfect beach day".

09:13.098 --> 09:14.464
What are you doing?

09:14.533 --> 09:16.212
- Mitchell...
- I'm lighting it.

09:16.247 --> 09:17.800
- No!
- I'm lighting it!

09:17.835 --> 09:19.235
No, that is our
monogrammed wedding candle,

09:19.304 --> 09:20.603
and we're supposed to save it.

09:20.672 --> 09:22.705
For what, Cam?

09:22.774 --> 09:24.107
- I don't know!
- You don't know.

09:24.175 --> 09:25.675
- I don't.
- You don't know.

09:25.744 --> 09:28.211
Ohh... look at it.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.579
Smells like eternal love.

09:31.614 --> 09:34.268
- Aww...oh.
- O-kay.

09:35.031 --> 09:36.880
Why are you always in my office?

09:36.949 --> 09:38.815
I do my best work in here.

09:38.884 --> 09:40.917
I've been trying to get into his head.

09:40.986 --> 09:42.586
I even brought his favorite lunch...

09:42.655 --> 09:44.687
shrimp cocktail and bourbon.

09:44.722 --> 09:46.789
Or that's just what you have for
lunch every day.

09:46.824 --> 09:48.328
That's another thing Earl stole from me!

09:48.363 --> 09:49.764
What did you find out?

09:49.799 --> 09:52.328
First of all, Shirl doesn't
know anything about the ashes.

09:52.376 --> 09:54.676
And second, we're not gonna be
a part of your little feud anymore.

09:54.745 --> 09:56.845
- We're gonna be friends.
- She's playing you!

09:56.914 --> 09:58.480
- No...
- Let me ask you a question.

09:58.549 --> 10:01.185
Did you tell her we're
bidding on Belmont Gardens?

10:01.210 --> 10:02.270
No. Why?

10:02.305 --> 10:04.219
Because 15 minutes ago,
I got a phone call

10:04.288 --> 10:06.470
saying just out of the blue,

10:06.505 --> 10:09.557
Closets Closets Closets Closets
is bidding against us.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.451
Did she see your proposal?

10:11.520 --> 10:13.481
Yes, Dad! I'm quite sure

10:13.516 --> 10:15.566
she rifled through my bag
when I was in the bathroom.

10:15.601 --> 10:17.744
You went to the bathroom? Why don't
you just give her the company?!

10:17.769 --> 10:18.941
Oh, God.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.625
- Bingo! Ketchup!
- What does that prove?

10:22.694 --> 10:25.328
- Did she have ketchup for lunch?
- She had... French fries.

10:25.397 --> 10:26.863
There's your smoking gun.

10:26.932 --> 10:30.544
Margaret? I'm gonna need fries
and ketchup to get in Shirl's head.

10:30.579 --> 10:31.915
No! No, Shirl wouldn't have done this.

10:31.950 --> 10:33.075
Um, bad news.

10:33.110 --> 10:35.404
Uh, we finally tracked down
those pineapple knobs,

10:35.475 --> 10:37.215
but they were all
just bought up by Closets...

10:37.244 --> 10:38.244
- No.
- ...Closets...

10:38.311 --> 10:40.911
- No, Margaret!
- ...Closets Closets.

10:42.282 --> 10:43.881
Shirl screwed me.

10:43.950 --> 10:45.350
You know what you have to do?

10:45.418 --> 10:46.651
You've got to hit her where it hurts.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.921
- What does she value most?
- Lazlo.

10:50.478 --> 10:53.645
I don't think you understand
how humiliating that was for me.

10:53.714 --> 10:55.848
There are parts of me
that will never uncringe.

10:55.916 --> 10:59.251
Oh, my God!
So I interrupted some boring story.

10:59.320 --> 11:02.488
Dr. Arvin Fennerman
is a two-time Vanderkoff Grant winner...

11:02.556 --> 11:04.523
one for philosophy
and one for geometry.

11:04.592 --> 11:05.809
You can't put him into a box because...

11:05.834 --> 11:07.364
Could you please just read my sample?

11:07.399 --> 11:11.116
This job is important to me.
This is my one shot at a real career.

11:11.151 --> 11:12.731
Fine, I'll read it. And "real career"?

11:12.800 --> 11:15.090
I've seen
this NERP business.

11:15.125 --> 11:17.008
Nicole Rosemary Page seems bonkers.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.936
Didn't she get in trouble
for cannibalism?

11:18.971 --> 11:21.544
No. Turns out there are no laws against

11:21.579 --> 11:24.923
eating your own appendix,
and it does help with fine lines.

11:24.958 --> 11:28.496
But she's a success story.
Child star, Bond girl,

11:28.499 --> 11:31.257
indie darling before she lost all her
money to a Fonzie scheme.

11:31.292 --> 11:33.887
- Don't you mean Ponzi scheme?
- Sadly, no.

11:33.922 --> 11:36.437
So, out of desperation,
she invented NERP,

11:36.472 --> 11:38.697
and next thing you know... boom! Empire.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.187
I just want to be
a part of something great.

11:40.243 --> 11:43.149
Well, if I'm being honest, your
writing sample's actually pretty good.

11:43.205 --> 11:44.371
Really?! Thank you.

11:44.439 --> 11:45.805
Oh, my God. It's Dr. Fennerman.

11:45.874 --> 11:47.512
Don't think, don't breathe,
keep your head down.

11:47.537 --> 11:48.537
O-kay.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.346
Hello.

11:53.415 --> 11:54.881
Sorry! Hello, Doctor.

11:54.950 --> 11:57.484
- Would you like down sit?
- What?

11:57.552 --> 11:59.719
Kind, that's very you of, Alex.

12:01.257 --> 12:03.758
Um... tell me again,
why were you in my class?

12:03.826 --> 12:05.326
I have a very big interview

12:05.394 --> 12:07.128
with Nicole Rosemary Page,
and she was just...

12:07.196 --> 12:08.996
Ugh! You know she's a snake oil
salesman, right?

12:09.065 --> 12:10.331
Yes, I know.

12:10.399 --> 12:11.999
People complain about
the diarrhea all the time,

12:12.018 --> 12:13.033
but that is the point.

12:13.102 --> 12:15.369
Her science is utter nonsense.

12:15.392 --> 12:17.359
I mean, space stickers
that give you energy,

12:17.428 --> 12:21.263
and crystals that absorb Wi-Fi,
and seriously... $1,200 socks?

12:21.332 --> 12:22.731
Those sheep eat nothing but sushi.

12:22.800 --> 12:25.500
- Are we done here?
- Surprisingly, not.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.003
This might sound crazy, but...

12:28.072 --> 12:30.201
- I'm going to marry you.
- What?!

12:30.226 --> 12:33.007
I'm sorry, first time
talking to a real girl?

12:33.065 --> 12:35.299
No, l-l-listen. I-I-I don't get it.

12:35.367 --> 12:38.836
Uh, frankly, it boggles the mind,
but I've been running

12:38.904 --> 12:42.272
dozens of probability scenarios
in my head since we met,

12:42.341 --> 12:44.742
and... and they all end with us...

12:44.810 --> 12:46.310
... together.

12:46.378 --> 12:48.678
I have heard some lame
pickup lines in my day, but...

12:48.709 --> 12:49.975
Oh, I have plenty of those.

12:50.044 --> 12:51.743
Um, are you a neuro-electrical current

12:51.812 --> 12:54.046
because you've been running
through my mind all day?

12:54.114 --> 12:55.314
But th-th-that's not what this is.

12:55.382 --> 12:57.583
This is going to happen, Haley Dunphy.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.885
- Ew, how do you know my name?
- I know everything.

12:59.954 --> 13:01.853
Also, your pass has
your name written on it.

13:01.922 --> 13:03.288
I think I'm gonna pass out.

13:03.357 --> 13:06.892
Right, I've just air-dropped
my contact info to your phone.

13:06.961 --> 13:09.394
Um, you just tap to accept it.

13:09.418 --> 13:12.018
Uh, yeah, not gonna... tap that.

13:12.087 --> 13:13.320
I think you will.

13:14.256 --> 13:18.258
Haley, there are forces in the universe
that we don't understand...

13:18.327 --> 13:21.761
measurable forces that...
can't be explained,

13:21.830 --> 13:24.998
but cannot be denied...

13:25.067 --> 13:26.900
and that's... that's what this is.

13:28.036 --> 13:31.137
I don't get it, but...
I know that it's real.

13:32.841 --> 13:34.841
Wow!

13:34.910 --> 13:36.476
That was so dumb!

13:36.545 --> 13:37.811
What? No, it wasn't.

13:37.879 --> 13:39.079
You're... You're dumb.

13:39.147 --> 13:41.548
That's gonna stick.
I'm... I'm in your head.

13:41.617 --> 13:42.749
- Okay.
- You'll see.

13:42.818 --> 13:44.484
Sure, buddy. Now try and walk away cool.

13:44.553 --> 13:46.019
- Oh, I will.
- Okay.

13:49.889 --> 13:51.155
We were standing right here making out.

13:51.224 --> 13:53.054
All of a sudden, he said,
"I'll be right back",

13:53.089 --> 13:55.463
and that was the last I saw of him.

13:55.527 --> 13:57.455
You guys, my break is over,
but I hope you find him.

13:57.524 --> 13:58.823
Thank you for your help,

13:58.892 --> 14:01.192
and the cupcakes are delicious,
by the way.

14:01.261 --> 14:03.094
- Those are for dogs.
- Oh, no.

14:03.163 --> 14:05.030
Ay, Phil, are you okay?

14:05.098 --> 14:06.398
Yeah, yeah.

14:06.466 --> 14:08.633
I'm sure there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation

14:08.702 --> 14:11.236
why Luke would abandon
a make-out session.

14:11.304 --> 14:14.739
No, there isn't.
A Dunphy man would never do that.

14:14.758 --> 14:17.492
We walk away from fights,
we walk away from spiders,

14:17.560 --> 14:20.194
but never a super-cute girl
who smells like frosting!

14:20.263 --> 14:21.529
You have to stay positive.

14:21.598 --> 14:24.932
Nothing bad ever happens
this close to a Pottery Barn.

14:24.966 --> 14:27.399
I've been putting on a brave face
to squash the darkness inside of me,

14:27.468 --> 14:29.702
but what if the worst has happened?
How will I tell Claire? I won't.

14:29.770 --> 14:31.770
I'll have to smother her with a pillow
to spare her the pain,

14:31.839 --> 14:34.206
but then Jay will have lost a
daughter. I'll have to smother him, too.

14:34.275 --> 14:36.175
That's two pillows from the
same set. It's a pattern.

14:36.244 --> 14:38.911
- The police are after me!
- Get ahold of yourself!

14:38.980 --> 14:40.779
- Ay!
- Ow! What the hell?

14:40.893 --> 14:43.093
It wasn't me. Look, I'm still cocked!

14:43.162 --> 14:44.594
It was a shoe.

14:44.663 --> 14:46.163
Wait, that's...

14:46.231 --> 14:48.065
that's Luke's.

14:48.133 --> 14:49.399
LUKE: Hey!

14:49.468 --> 14:51.868
Luke! You're okay!

14:51.937 --> 14:53.837
I got stuck on the roof.

14:53.906 --> 14:55.505
I'm so relieved!

14:55.574 --> 14:57.707
I don't have to kill your mother!

14:58.811 --> 15:00.343
Turns out,
Luke had to go to the bathroom.

15:00.412 --> 15:01.678
Someone told him it was upstairs,

15:01.747 --> 15:03.080
so he walked all the way up to the roof

15:03.148 --> 15:04.614
and locked himself out.

15:04.683 --> 15:06.483
His phone was dead,
and he... he lost his voice

15:06.552 --> 15:08.919
trying to scream over
the street musicians.

15:08.987 --> 15:11.922
I was so relieved, I ran up there and
gave him a big kiss.

15:12.664 --> 15:14.598
PHIL: Gloria!

15:14.666 --> 15:16.399
Hi. We're stuck.

15:16.468 --> 15:19.102
Could you pop on up and open the door?

15:19.171 --> 15:20.837
Dunphy men.

15:24.543 --> 15:26.176
Hello, Lazlo.

15:26.245 --> 15:29.612
- It's pronounced "Lazlo".
- That's what I said.

15:29.757 --> 15:31.457
Thank you so much for meeting with us.

15:31.525 --> 15:33.125
Have you had a chance
to consider our offer

15:33.194 --> 15:34.326
to join Pritchett's Closets?

15:34.395 --> 15:36.829
I'm intrigued,
but I have a list of demands.

15:36.897 --> 15:39.498
Ah, yes, of course.

15:39.567 --> 15:40.833
We have, uh...

15:40.901 --> 15:43.102
...uh, "Two turquoise bowls
of white Chiclets,

15:43.170 --> 15:45.404
an empty office
with a drain in the floor..."

15:45.473 --> 15:47.773
- What's a "scream room"?
- I think that's self-explanatory.

15:47.842 --> 15:49.208
- Hmm.
- SHIRL: Pritchett!

15:49.276 --> 15:50.509
Girl Earl!

15:50.578 --> 15:54.446
You're actually trying
to poach Lazlo from me?

15:54.589 --> 15:55.955
I thought we were friends.

15:56.023 --> 15:58.157
We were, and then you bought
all my pineapple knobs.

15:58.226 --> 15:59.859
- As a gift!
- What?

15:59.927 --> 16:01.427
- I had them sent to you.
- You did?

16:01.495 --> 16:04.830
Don't listen to her.
This is all part of some sick plan.

16:04.846 --> 16:08.647
Stealing Claire's proposals,
Earl's urn to get in my head.

16:08.716 --> 16:10.516
But your little games
are not gonna work.

16:10.585 --> 16:12.084
Yeah. Yeah, how do you explain

16:12.153 --> 16:14.720
the red ketchup stains
on my proposal, French Fries?

16:14.789 --> 16:16.422
I never use ketchup.

16:16.491 --> 16:18.958
I like my fries the way
I like my Lazlo...

16:19.026 --> 16:20.860
undressed.

16:20.928 --> 16:22.747
Twiddle-Dee.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.105
You guys have a really
complicated relationship.

16:25.140 --> 16:27.229
And what's that red stain?

16:31.005 --> 16:32.438
Shrimp cocktail sauce, uh-oh.

16:32.506 --> 16:33.606
Dad!

16:33.674 --> 16:34.807
- Shirl...
- Save it.

16:34.876 --> 16:37.142
We could have been friends.
Well, forget it.

16:37.211 --> 16:38.844
Game on.

16:39.747 --> 16:40.980
Shirl...

16:41.048 --> 16:42.448
What is she up to?

16:42.516 --> 16:46.022
No, no. Your crazy conspiracy theories
just cost me a friend.

16:46.057 --> 16:48.921
I thought I'd finally found
an... an ally in this industry,

16:48.956 --> 16:51.712
somebody to... to climb the hill with.

16:51.747 --> 16:54.644
Up the hill! Oh, my God! That's it!

16:54.679 --> 16:57.334
No, no, you do not get to have an
epiphany right now!

16:57.369 --> 16:59.058
I am furious at you!

16:59.093 --> 17:01.760
The answer is...yes.

17:02.617 --> 17:04.357
People say that NERP

17:04.425 --> 17:05.791
is nothing more than a con job,

17:05.861 --> 17:08.694
a cash-grab vanity project
from a kooky actress.

17:08.763 --> 17:09.996
Ugh.

17:10.065 --> 17:12.050
Oh, I'm sorry. Was that a question?

17:12.086 --> 17:13.184
- No.
- Oh, okay.

17:13.219 --> 17:14.219
But...

17:14.306 --> 17:15.659
is it true?

17:15.694 --> 17:18.070
- They don't tell me things.
- Who's "they"?

17:18.152 --> 17:21.721
See, I don't see NERP
as, like, a business.

17:21.789 --> 17:24.390
- It's more, like, a kind of...
- Like a way of life! Me too!

17:24.459 --> 17:27.951
Walt Disney once... envisioned...

17:27.986 --> 17:29.554
a magical world...

17:29.564 --> 17:31.764
...and people told him he was mad.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.666
They called it "Walt's Folly."

17:33.735 --> 17:36.537
- But you know what that place became?
- Disneyland.

17:36.572 --> 17:39.531
- That was not a question.
- Oh, I... I'm sorry.

17:41.990 --> 17:44.723
That place is Disneyland.

17:44.758 --> 17:47.613
What?! That's crazy.
Didn't see it coming.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.133
I want to turn NERP

17:49.202 --> 17:52.670
into the next
Disney-Facebook-Tesla-Botox.

17:52.739 --> 17:56.140
It's a world changer.
It's a road map to the future.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.078
- That was a question!
- Oh...uh...uh...

18:01.147 --> 18:02.780
Alright, listen.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.950
I really liked
your writing sample, it's true.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.219
But...

18:08.288 --> 18:10.288
...we have a lot of candidates

18:10.356 --> 18:13.858
with more experience
and famous-er parents, so...

18:14.327 --> 18:16.126
fly away, little birdie.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.845
Flap. Flap, flap.

18:22.816 --> 18:24.115
Okay, thank you.

18:26.953 --> 18:28.753
Nicole?

18:28.822 --> 18:30.955
You and me... this is gonna happen.

18:31.024 --> 18:32.356
Excuse me?

18:32.425 --> 18:35.293
There are forces in the universe that
we don't understand.

18:35.361 --> 18:37.695
They can't be explained,
but they cannot be denied,

18:37.764 --> 18:39.363
and that is what this is.

18:39.432 --> 18:42.767
I don't... I don't get it,
but I know that it's real.

18:42.836 --> 18:44.302
Oh, my God!

18:44.370 --> 18:47.273
That is just what I said
to all of those haters

18:47.308 --> 18:49.825
who told me that
my crystal energy stickers

18:49.860 --> 18:51.354
did not improve your colon health.

18:51.389 --> 18:52.539
- Uh!
- Crazy.

18:52.574 --> 18:54.245
- They do if you, you know...
- Yeah.

18:54.314 --> 18:57.681
So, um, does that mean that I will see
you Monday morning?

18:57.732 --> 18:58.898
Let's make it Tuesday

18:58.967 --> 19:01.167
'cause I like to spend
Mondays in a flotation tank.

19:03.371 --> 19:06.906
<i>JAY: As young men, we'd hike this
path up to an old oak tree,</i>

19:06.975 --> 19:09.809
<i>where we'd brainstorm how
to conquer the closet universe.</i>

19:09.878 --> 19:13.113
<i>We foolishly thought that
we knew everything back then.</i>

19:13.181 --> 19:16.382
<i>But hopefully, I've learned
a few things through the years.</i>

19:19.121 --> 19:23.423
<i>Like, live today as if
there's no tomorrow...</i>

19:23.492 --> 19:26.593
<i>that it's not
too late to right past wrongs,</i>

19:26.661 --> 19:30.129
<i>and when things are
looking down, look up...</i>

19:31.366 --> 19:34.100
<i>...or take chances you never
imagined you would.</i>

19:36.465 --> 19:37.715
_

19:41.042 --> 19:45.278
"You stupid softy, I knew you'd do it.

19:45.347 --> 19:47.914
Did you try to do something special?

19:47.983 --> 19:50.083
Was it at sunset?

19:50.152 --> 19:52.118
It was at sunset, wasn't it?

19:53.755 --> 19:56.289
Sucker. I win.

19:56.358 --> 19:58.124
See you in hell."

20:00.595 --> 20:02.695
I look forward to that.

- Whoo!
- Whoo!

20:17.772 --> 20:20.050
- Whoo!
- Ohh, this is amazing!

20:20.085 --> 20:22.007
I know! We should have
done this years ago.

20:22.042 --> 20:23.633
Whoa. I'm a little cold.
Are you a little cold?

20:23.668 --> 20:25.474
Yeah, the parts of
me that I can still feel sure are.

20:25.509 --> 20:27.806
Oh, look at those suckers
on their way home from work.

20:28.109 --> 20:29.920
Enjoy the rat race!

20:29.945 --> 20:32.378
- Don't forget to pay your taxes!
- Yeah!

20:32.403 --> 20:36.105
Hey, did you see the story
about that, um, dinosaur fish?

20:36.119 --> 20:39.204
It said it had the head of...
a head of a snake or something.

20:39.229 --> 20:40.582
- Yeah, 16 rows of teeth, uh-huh.
- Yeah.

20:42.190 --> 20:44.700
Hey, do you think that we look like
seals from underneath?

20:44.725 --> 20:47.156
- Mitchell, w-what are we doing?
- What are we...

20:47.181 --> 20:49.948
We're living our lives,
is what we're doing.

20:49.973 --> 20:54.194
Yeah, but I, uh, I'm just asking,
but was imagining it more fun?

20:54.219 --> 20:55.451
Well, it was warmer.

20:55.476 --> 20:58.291
You know, I like
looking forward to things.

20:58.316 --> 21:00.464
Carly Simon's big hit
was "Anticipation",

21:00.489 --> 21:02.611
not "Remember That Cool Thing We Did".

21:02.636 --> 21:05.129
Hey, I have an idea. L-Let's go back,

21:05.154 --> 21:06.926
we'll buy a bottle of
wine that we'll never open

21:06.951 --> 21:08.336
and a candle that we'll never light,

21:08.361 --> 21:10.320
- call it a day, huh?
- That sounds wonderful.

21:10.345 --> 21:12.502
- Okay, but stop touching my feet.
- I didn't touch you.

21:12.527 --> 21:15.303
- I didn't touch you.
- You didn't...

21:15.328 --> 21:17.669
- Dinosaur fish! Dinosaur fish!
- Dinosaur fish! Dinosaur fish!

21:17.694 --> 21:21.138
Mitchell!
Mitchell, do not leave me alone!
