00:26.109 --> 00:28.820

I'm ever gonna eat again.

-[Henry] Hi, Mom.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.787
Judy's back! Hi!

00:37.871 --> 00:39.289
-Hey. Morning.
-Hi!

00:39.372 --> 00:41.416
-I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

00:41.791 --> 00:43.960
Thanks for my bird.
Oh, I should go get it.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.003
Huh? No, uh, no.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.922
Uh, sweetheart, why don't you just
go have your breakfast right now?

00:48.006 --> 00:50.258
Then get your shoes on. I don't want you
to be late for the bus.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.677
I thought Judy wasn't gonna be
in our lives anymore.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.429
You guys are friends again, or...

00:54.804 --> 00:56.222
-Uh...
-Um...

00:56.306 --> 00:59.017
-I'd like to think that's the case.
-Not really, it's not like that.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.436
-I'm hoping...
-She came to get the rest of her things.

01:01.519 --> 01:02.562
-[Charlie] Got it.
-So...

01:03.188 --> 01:04.105
Oh.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.484
-Um, where are all of my things?
-I burned them.

01:08.860 --> 01:09.778
Even my paintings?

01:09.861 --> 01:11.696
Look, I was upset.
There was only, like, two.

-Yeah.

Charlie, I can't.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.371
I've had my permit for, like, a week.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.582
-She won't even let me practice driving.
-Okay, got you.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.375
Charlie, please, not now. Please.

01:24.709 --> 01:27.170
Okay? I've-- I've had
a really long night, and, um...

01:28.046 --> 01:29.255
you will practice.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.924
Okay? I promise you, honey.

-Something died.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.942
-What?
-A squirrel.

01:49.025 --> 01:49.901
Dog.

01:49.984 --> 01:51.236
-Spider... dog.
-It was a dog.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.154
-A dog died in the pool?
-[Jen] Yeah.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.448
-A big one.
-Yeah.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.574
[Henry] I lost my appetite.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.284
-[Judy] It was old.
-The dog would've wanted you to eat.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.202
It was very old.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.663
-I think it might have killed itself.
-Okay, that's enough.

but I also know that you tend
to get a little confessy.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.300
Well, I got confessy with you
because I couldn't let you believe

02:55.383 --> 02:57.260
that you were responsible
for your husband's death.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.637

It's too fucking late, Judy.

Okay?

03:20.825 --> 03:21.910
He got in my face.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.330
[sobs] And he tried to strangle me.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.416
And it was very scary.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.545
And I had to fight back
because my boys were inside.

03:33.463 --> 03:36.132
Okay, but don't you think
the police would understand?

03:36.633 --> 03:37.800
That was self-defense.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.844
Yes, it was. It was,

03:39.928 --> 03:42.513
but what am I gonna--
How's it gonna look if I go to the cops?

03:42.639 --> 03:43.890
Steve killed my husband.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.184

04:06.412 --> 04:08.748

going to the police

12:27.079 --> 12:28.581
-would you say?
-Both.

12:28.956 --> 12:32.543
You know, I like to make sure
there's a tight tuck, 'cause...

12:33.252 --> 12:34.879
'cause sometimes people really like that.

12:34.962 --> 12:37.006
I'm good at it, so I hope that's okay.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.758
Yeah, no worries.

12:38.841 --> 12:39.967
No, none, no.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.344
Great. Great.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.555
Well, it was wonderful to meet you...

12:45.681 --> 12:47.183
Flo. Bye.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.309
See you guys.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.312
Keep her away from me.

12:51.395 --> 12:53.814
[Michelle] Mom,
there was no way she didn't hear that.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.575
[Karen] The quality is amazing, right?

13:04.658 --> 13:08.454
[Jen] No, it's great, but is it even legal
to spy on people like that?

13:08.537 --> 13:11.081
Oh, there's basically
no privacy laws anymore.

13:11.165 --> 13:11.999
Oh.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.959
It's one of the reasons
I'm glad I live in this era.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.170
-Oh, right. That's...
-Yeah.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.755
-Not that it matters.
-[inhales]

13:17.838 --> 13:19.965
Nothing interesting ever happens
on our street.

13:20.382 --> 13:22.927
Except for whatever happened
in this backyard last night.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.304
-What?
-You know, with the...

13:25.763 --> 13:26.597
fucking.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.641
Oh, yeah.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.726
The... fucking.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.353
YALO. Or is it YOLO?

13:32.436 --> 13:33.771
I don't know, Karen.

13:33.854 --> 13:36.023
Okay. Look, it even has night vision.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.274
[Jen] Oh.

13:38.484 --> 13:41.237
-That's last night.
-Wow, that's-- that's really clear.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.154
[Karen] Mm-hmm.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.786
Do you like the orange wine?

13:48.869 --> 13:50.496
Yeah, yeah, it really coats the mouth.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.289
-[water rippling]
-Um...

13:52.498 --> 13:56.085
How do you erase this? Do you erase this
every day, or how do you erase it?

13:56.168 --> 13:58.170
Uh, I don't. I keep it all on the cloud.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.424
[rustling]

14:02.508 --> 14:03.968
[Karen] What is that noise?

14:08.597 --> 14:11.475

-Wait, what are you doing?

14:17.940 --> 14:19.275
What the fuck? What are you doing?

14:19.358 --> 14:21.277
-There's a sound coming from your drain.
-Huh?

14:22.194 --> 14:23.946
You don't want anything stuck in there.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.658
Could be a nightmare.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.162
-Yeah. Yep. [mutters]
-Hmm?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.083
Here's the culprit.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.296
Yeah, that's just a toy. It's just a...

14:41.297 --> 14:42.423
Shouldn't be in there.

14:43.007 --> 14:43.883

-[Michelle] Hey, Judy.
-Oh, hey.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.914
Is there a lost and found here?

15:14.997 --> 15:17.541
I found this cigar box someone left
in the room.

15:18.375 --> 15:20.044
You know, hidden in the box spring?

15:20.127 --> 15:22.504
Oh, weird, someone left that there.

15:22.588 --> 15:23.672
Yeah, it's super weird.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.883
And I definitely didn't look inside

15:26.508 --> 15:29.261
to see that there was a bunch of weed
and some car keys.

15:44.985 --> 15:45.819
Thank you.

15:47.154 --> 15:48.364
Oh, okay.

Your hair smells so good.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.204
Thanks?

15:55.621 --> 15:58.624
You're welcome. [sniffles]

16:00.125 --> 16:03.504
[Jen] Okay, now you just,
please, just be careful. Go slow.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.547
-Mom, it's fine.
-Get your eyes on the road, please.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.091
I know. I know.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.096
Yeah. How-- how do you know how to drive?

16:13.931 --> 16:15.182
Dad taught me.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.143
Oh. He did, huh?

16:18.727 --> 16:20.896
Or he was teaching me,
right before he died.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.400
Was he?

16:24.900 --> 16:27.820
It was actually really cool,
driving with him.

16:30.531 --> 16:34.243
I'm glad that you got
to spend that time together.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.371
Why didn't you tell me?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.625
He said not to.
I guess he didn't want to piss you off.

Thank you, Abe.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.025
[Jen] So I was looking online,

17:48.108 --> 17:52.738
and we can actually petition
to get a stop sign at that intersection.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.157
-Nothing happened.
-Hm?

17:55.282 --> 17:56.950
You-- you're overreacting.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.410
Okay, well, I'm not.

17:58.786 --> 18:03.207
And you know what? Don't ever tell a woman
that she is overreacting, okay?

18:03.290 --> 18:05.459
Because most of the time,
women are underreacting.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.338
This is my reaction,
which means that I am reacting perfectly.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.756
Is Judy coming back?

18:10.839 --> 18:12.341
-They broke up again.
-Char.

You break up a lot.

Boop, honey.
Are you okay? Did you have a bad dream?

21:00.509 --> 21:02.427
-Yeah.
-Oh. [exhales]

21:03.762 --> 21:04.805
You want to tell me?

21:06.640 --> 21:07.516
Well...

21:09.977 --> 21:11.853
[stammering] I was alone in a room.

21:12.854 --> 21:16.066
And-- and someone--
someone was taking you away.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.822
Oh. Do you...

21:23.824 --> 21:25.617
Do you know who it was?

21:25.701 --> 21:27.244
I'm not sure, I couldn't tell.

21:27.327 --> 21:29.329
Oh. Yeah, that...

That is a bad dream, huh?

Yeah.

I didn't think you'd call.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.079
You left your, uh... bracelet here.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.832
<i>Oh. Sorry. I, uh...</i>

23:38.333 --> 23:40.001
You can just throw it out, or...

burn it or whatever.

23:45.215 --> 23:46.049
Oh.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.927
Thought maybe you left it here on purpose.

Well, I'm not gonna
have you sleeping in a car.

Mm-hmm.

Might have been a year and a half.

24:54.242 --> 24:56.411
Wasn't that bad. It was a hatchback.

everything's gonna be all right?

Oh, no. I know.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.158
I know you know.

25:42.707 --> 25:43.542

-No, no, no. Don't be sorry.

and it was not your fault.

you're protecting her.

27:37.322 --> 27:38.448
Yeah. No, it's fine.

I mean, you can stay
until you find somewhere permanent.

Okay, and to be clear,
you burned all of my stuff?

Well, not your blanket.

27:45.622 --> 27:48.124
And some of your crystals
wouldn't take the hint,

Oh, also...

-Thank you.
-Yeah.

27:56.466 --> 27:57.300
Hey.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.844
Parker's gonna be driving me to school.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.471
Oh, is that a telling, not an asking?
