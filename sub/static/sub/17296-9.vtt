Kid Flash.

00:24.763 --> 00:28.028
Stealing my team and leaving
only the most useless member.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.422
At least you still gots me, bro.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.076
Now my streak will be over.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.252
I'll have to eat
my own sour grapes.

00:39.430 --> 00:42.259
- Awful.
- Bro, we're still a team.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.261
All we gots to do
is stop one more crime

00:44.305 --> 00:46.089
and you get to keep your streak.

00:46.133 --> 00:49.179
Two people do not make a team.
Everyone knows that!

00:49.223 --> 00:50.702
We are a duo.

00:50.746 --> 00:52.617
Partners. A pair. A couplet.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.184
A doublet. An odd couple.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.533
Master and student.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.579
Tango and Cash.
Turner and Hooch.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.450
Two guys from
different backgrounds

00:59.494 --> 01:00.799
trying to make it work.

01:00.843 --> 01:03.193
But a team?
Not by a long shot.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.587
So?
We just make a new team then.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.719
Kid Flash couldn't find
any superheroes,

01:07.763 --> 01:09.199
what makes you think we can?

01:09.243 --> 01:11.549
You just gots to know
where to look, bro.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.943
- And where is that?
- Oh.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.249
I thought you knew.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.598
Argh!

01:16.641 --> 01:18.469
Gots you.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.254
That's just some of that
good comic relief

01:20.297 --> 01:22.778
I'm known for.

01:22.821 --> 01:25.085
Don't sweat it.
I gots the new teammates.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.608
You just enjoy them grapes.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.576
Guys, so excited to have you on my team.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.926
We are going to absolutely
crush crime season,

01:40.970 --> 01:42.928
and bring Robin's streak
to an end.

01:42.972 --> 01:45.279
Oh, I can't wait to see
the look on his face.

01:45.322 --> 01:47.107
Dude, don't get so excited.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.760
We haven't even stopped
one crime yet.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.415
And this one appears to be
the difficult challenge.

01:53.461 --> 01:56.159
All right, let's do this.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.161
- Done.
- What?

02:00.729 --> 02:03.035
- You are the man.
- The ooh and the awe.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.994
Hey, I like letting
someone else do all the work.

02:05.037 --> 02:06.517
Then you'll like
being on my team.

02:08.345 --> 02:09.651
Now just relax,

02:09.694 --> 02:11.566
while I take care of
51 more crimes.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.791
The streak is over.

02:19.835 --> 02:22.490
And I spent my last dollar
on this pedestal.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.361
My hubris knows no bounds.

02:24.405 --> 02:27.190
I finally understand why Icarus
was such a piece of trash.

02:27.234 --> 02:30.454
Yo, yo, yo! You ready
to meet the new teammates?

02:30.498 --> 02:32.152
Can't wait.

02:32.195 --> 02:35.067
I thinks you gonna be
pleasantly surprised, bro.

02:35.111 --> 02:37.069
These guys are
bottom of the barrel.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.989
Beast Boy, you did it.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.687
And I thought
you were worthless.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.558
Did you really manage to recruit

02:47.602 --> 02:49.865
the three best members
of the Justice League?

02:49.908 --> 02:52.302
No. These are my bedsheets.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.304
I was just trying to use them
to cover the new guys

02:54.348 --> 02:55.697
to build suspense, yo.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.352
Say hello
to the new Teen Titans.

02:58.395 --> 03:01.311
Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy,
and Sticky Joe.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.530
Howdy!

03:02.573 --> 03:04.706
I was right.
You are worthless.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.055
These are not superheroes!

03:06.098 --> 03:07.839
Not a superhero?

03:07.883 --> 03:11.669
Know anyone else who can carry
all the toys in the world

03:11.713 --> 03:14.237
while dealing
with a nagging wife

03:14.281 --> 03:16.848
and eight frisky reindeer?

03:16.892 --> 03:19.111
And I am quite the sneer.
Ta-ta-ra-ta-ta.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.331
My little fingers were
burrowing under your pillow

03:21.375 --> 03:23.899
in search of smile bones
just last night.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.509
Ta-ta-ra-ta-ta.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.207
Howdy!

03:27.250 --> 03:29.078
This will never work.
They're not real superheroes.

03:29.121 --> 03:31.907
I wasn't a real superhero
neither, bro.

03:31.950 --> 03:35.345
Not till you gave me a chance
and made me a Teen Titan.

03:35.389 --> 03:38.043
You just gotta give them
a chance too, bro.

03:38.087 --> 03:41.221
So, you all wanna join
the Teen Titans?

03:41.264 --> 03:44.528
Any excuse to get away
from Mrs. Claus.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.705
Uh, she can be a real
lump of coal,

03:47.749 --> 03:49.751
if you catch my drift.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.277
I will do it for teeth.

03:54.321 --> 03:57.237
I will do anything for teeth.
Ta-ta-ra-ta-ta.

03:57.280 --> 03:59.804
There are no teeth involved.
Da-da-da-da-da.

03:59.848 --> 04:02.242
We'll see. Ta-ta-ra-ta-ta.

04:02.285 --> 04:05.114
Very well.
I officially declare you all

04:05.157 --> 04:06.637
to be members
of the Teen Titans.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.816
Our current mission
is to win crime season.

04:11.860 --> 04:14.732
As you can see,
Kid Flash is right behind us,

04:14.776 --> 04:17.431
but we just need to stop
one more crime to win.

04:17.474 --> 04:20.085
And that's our chance to do it.

04:20.129 --> 04:21.173
Titans, go!

04:28.006 --> 04:30.618
All right, rookies,
let's see what you got.

04:30.661 --> 04:35.275
There's only one way
to handle naughty children.

04:39.801 --> 04:42.282
Please, tell me you can do
better than that?

04:46.198 --> 04:47.635
Teeth!

05:02.258 --> 05:04.129
Titans, get your heads
in the game!

05:04.173 --> 05:05.870
Hey, how's it going, buddy?
I dig the new team!

05:05.914 --> 05:07.219
Those are bold choices.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.395
Will you excuse me for a moment?

05:12.094 --> 05:13.661
And that makes 51.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.186
Oh, wait.
Did I just tie the score?

05:17.229 --> 05:18.361
Yeah, you did!

05:18.405 --> 05:19.623
Ha!

05:19.667 --> 05:20.842
Couldn't do it without you guys.

05:20.885 --> 05:22.234
- Glad we could help.
- Indeed.

05:22.278 --> 05:24.367
The refill, please.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.717
Guys, please come back.
I need you.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.676
You know how important
this streak is to me.

05:28.719 --> 05:30.678
It would not be right
to leave the Kid Flash

05:30.721 --> 05:32.897
at the end of the crime season.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.377
That's what you did to me!

05:34.421 --> 05:36.379
Yeah. But you made us do work!

05:36.423 --> 05:38.686
We don't like work.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.035
Look in your hearts.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.037
You're still Teen Titans,

05:42.080 --> 05:43.517
- and you always will...
- Hey!

05:43.560 --> 05:45.693
Who wants pizza? I'm buying.

05:45.736 --> 05:46.998
What?

05:47.042 --> 05:49.523
You are the paying
for the pizza?

05:52.439 --> 05:54.484
He paid for the pizza.

05:54.528 --> 05:57.531
This is the greatest day
of my life!

05:59.054 --> 06:00.403
Enjoy your free food!

06:00.447 --> 06:02.753
I'm still going to get
to 52 first!

06:02.797 --> 06:04.712
Ha! With that team of weirdos?

06:11.588 --> 06:12.589
Good luck.

06:14.548 --> 06:18.421
How dare Kid Flash
call my team weirdos?

06:23.992 --> 06:25.733
No. No, no, no. Stop!

06:25.776 --> 06:27.169
Stop acting like weirdos.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.521
- Howdy!
- I can't take this!

06:34.785 --> 06:37.397
Any second now
the streak will be over.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.270
Maybe I was too hard
on Cyborg, Starfire and Raven.

06:41.313 --> 06:42.576
You look like a man

06:42.619 --> 06:46.231
who just drank some
spoiled milk.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.277
I can't win crime season
without my team.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.800
My real team.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.455
What is wrong
with your garbage brain?

06:52.499 --> 06:55.153
Don't you see?
You are the team.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.416
As the leader,

06:56.459 --> 07:00.289
you're the only one who matters.

07:00.332 --> 07:02.552
It's not true, Santa.

07:02.596 --> 07:03.814
You couldn't do your job

07:03.858 --> 07:05.425
without your faithful reindeer.

07:05.468 --> 07:08.602
Oh, sure, sure.
They're so important.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.604
I bet you know
all their names, right?

07:13.041 --> 07:14.956
But what about Tyson or Graebel?

07:14.999 --> 07:17.741
- Who?
- Oh, you never heard of them?

07:17.785 --> 07:18.916
Ah, of course, you didn't,

07:18.960 --> 07:20.483
because they were garbage.

07:20.527 --> 07:24.182
So I sent them to
the dog food factory.

07:26.141 --> 07:28.665
Individuals don't matter, son.

07:28.709 --> 07:33.627
It's what a leader can get
his team to do together

07:33.670 --> 07:35.629

08:36.951 --> 08:39.649
But, it took years
to figure out the team

08:39.693 --> 08:40.998
and everyone's place on it.

08:41.042 --> 08:43.697
If you've done your job
as leader,

08:43.740 --> 08:45.873
everyone should naturally

08:45.916 --> 08:49.224
fall into their roles.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.442
I see.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.402
Howdy!

08:54.577 --> 08:56.884
The team fits the mold I make.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.408
That means, I can lead
any group of losers,

08:59.451 --> 09:01.062
weirdos or vagrants to victory.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.238
The crime alert.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.066
Killer Moth is back.

09:05.109 --> 09:07.459
This is it. Our 52nd crime.

09:07.503 --> 09:10.245
We stop it, we win crime season.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.376
Titans, go!

09:28.263 --> 09:31.701
We stop Killer Moth here
and the streak stays alive.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.400
Not so fast, Robin.

09:35.444 --> 09:36.967
Kid Flash.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.926
Do you really need to try
to stop the same crime?

09:38.969 --> 09:40.231
Of course.

09:40.275 --> 09:41.711
I wanna see
the look on your face

09:41.755 --> 09:44.105
when I win and you lose
your precious streak.

09:44.148 --> 09:46.629
So that's what this was
all about.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.413
Yeah. You and me.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.328
One winner, one loser.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.809
And with that team of weirdos
backing you up,

09:52.853 --> 09:54.768
I think we both know
who the loser is.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.247
You took my team,

09:56.291 --> 09:58.946
and you'll probably take
my victory too.

09:58.989 --> 10:02.297
- Can I just ask you one thing?
- Sure.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.908
How's your other knee?

10:04.952 --> 10:07.084
Ow! Ow! This time
there was a popping.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.259
Ow!

10:08.303 --> 10:09.957
Oh, little help, guys.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.262
- Uh-uh.
- No, thank you.

10:11.306 --> 10:12.437
Let's wrap this up.

10:12.481 --> 10:13.787
- Titans, go!
- Ow!

10:20.228 --> 10:21.795
Ahhh!

10:26.190 --> 10:28.976
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yes!

10:30.717 --> 10:33.284
♪ Them sour grapes
You brought them sour grapes ♪

10:33.328 --> 10:35.373
