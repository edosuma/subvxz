00:02.440 --> 00:07.309
You know, I gotta say that I'm enjoying
adulthood for a lot of reasons.

00:07.480 --> 00:08.879
I'll tell you reason number one:

00:10.400 --> 00:14.518
As an adult, if I want a cookie,
I have a cookie, okay?

00:14.680 --> 00:17.638
I have three cookies
or four cookies...

00:17.800 --> 00:20.997
...or 11 cookies if I want.

00:21.160 --> 00:26.188
Many times, I will intentionally ruin
my entire appetite.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.554
Just ruin it.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.156
And then I call my mother up
right after to tell her that I did it.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.676
"Hello, Mom? Yeah, I just ruined
my entire appetite.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.876
Cookies."

00:38.040 --> 00:39.029
So what if you ruin it?

00:39.200 --> 00:42.078
As an adult, we understand
even if you ruin an appetite...

00:42.240 --> 00:45.118
...there's another appetite coming
right behind it.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.919
There's no danger
in running out of appetites.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.789
I've got millions of them.
I ruin them whenever I want.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.474
Look, Zigmond. Look at the sky!

01:01.640 --> 01:03.756
The planet's on fire!

01:03.920 --> 01:05.990
It is just as you prophesised!

01:06.160 --> 01:09.596
The planets of our solar system
incinerating...

01:09.760 --> 01:15.756
...lik e flaming globes, Zigmond,
lik e flaming globes!

01:20.000 --> 01:21.797
Zigmond...

01:43.360 --> 01:45.316
- Coffee.
- Thank you.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.188
What do you got, a cucumber?

01:49.800 --> 01:51.870
Yeah. So what?

01:52.680 --> 01:54.636
You're bringing in
an outside cucumber?

01:54.800 --> 01:57.758
They refuse to put cucumber
in the salad. I need cucumber.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.310
What have I done? What...?
I can't read this.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.870
"Fullman hurtel vom"?

02:05.000 --> 02:08.993
I got up last night, I wrote this down.
I thought I had this great bit.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.276
Wait a second.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.750
"Fax me some halibut."

02:15.560 --> 02:17.471
Is that funny? Is that a joke?

02:17.640 --> 02:19.198
No. Let me see that.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.915
"Don't mess with Johnny."

02:22.320 --> 02:23.958
Johnny? Johnny who?

02:24.120 --> 02:26.998
Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny
on The Tonight Show?

02:27.160 --> 02:29.628
Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?

02:29.800 --> 02:30.949
Let me see that.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.473
- Hey, where's Kramer?
- I don't know.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.835
That's like asking,
"Where's Waldo?"

02:37.480 --> 02:39.072
I think I'm having a heart attack.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.479
I don't think that's it.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.551
- I'm not kidding.
- What does that mean?

02:45.320 --> 02:47.675
I think what he's trying to say...

02:47.840 --> 02:49.796
...is that he's having a heart attack.

02:49.960 --> 02:51.552
Oh, he's having a heart attack.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.878
- Tightness.
- Come on.

02:54.040 --> 02:56.031
- Shortness of breath.
- This is ridiculous.

02:56.200 --> 02:58.430
- Radiating waves of pain.
- I know what this is!

02:58.600 --> 03:03.071
You saw that show on PBS last night,
Coronary Country.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.470
I saw it in the TV Guide,
I called him...

03:05.640 --> 03:07.835
...told him make sure
and not watch it.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.752
There was nothing else on.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.514
- Here, have some water.
- Oh, the left arm, left arm.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.111
He saw that show
on anorexia last year...

03:15.280 --> 03:17.316
...ate like an animal for two weeks.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.914
Why can't I have a heart attack?!
I'm allowed.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.832
You want me to take you
to the hospital?

03:22.160 --> 03:24.196
Manhattan Memorial. Less of a line.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.952
I'll call an ambulance.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.359
Is everything all right?

03:30.040 --> 03:31.837
We'll just take a check.

03:37.640 --> 03:38.914
You made a mistake on the...

03:39.080 --> 03:40.991
George.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.312
Are you okay?

03:53.000 --> 03:56.470
I'm George. George Costanza.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.591
I never been in the hospital
a day in my life...

04:01.040 --> 04:03.235
...except when I had my tonsils out.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.510
You know, they never gave me
any ice cream.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.988
- I always felt that if they...
- Shut up!

04:13.040 --> 04:16.714
- Well, what do you think?
- "Salami salami bologna."

04:16.880 --> 04:18.438
Definitely.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.829
"Salami salami bologna"?

04:21.000 --> 04:25.152
Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a
heart attack. I'll be in in a few minutes.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.753
What a surprise.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.393
Hey.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.993
How you doing, buddy?

04:34.000 --> 04:35.353
You need anything?

04:36.120 --> 04:38.554
You want me to go out,
get you a Superman comic?

04:39.080 --> 04:41.116
No. No, thanks.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.200
You know, I was wondering...

04:44.360 --> 04:46.430
...you know that Blackhawks jacket
you have?

04:46.600 --> 04:49.637
Oh, sure, my Blackhawks jacket.
I love my Blackhawks jacket.

04:49.800 --> 04:54.590
Well, you know, I was thinking,
if things don't exactly...

04:55.960 --> 04:57.757
...work out...

04:59.160 --> 05:01.799
Well, it wouldn't fit you.
The sleeves are too short.

05:01.960 --> 05:03.712
No, I tried it on. It fits good.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.916
I didn't think about
what I was gonna do...

05:07.080 --> 05:10.117
...with all the things...
- Well, you know...

05:11.440 --> 05:13.158
Well...

05:13.320 --> 05:15.231
- Well, okay.
- Oh, and...

05:15.400 --> 05:17.960
...do you think it'd be all right
if I called Susan Davis?

05:18.120 --> 05:20.190
Susan Davis?! Hey, wait a second!

05:20.360 --> 05:23.079
Well, it's not like we'll be
bumping into you.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.270
I don't know. You and Susan Davis?

05:26.440 --> 05:28.192
You know...

05:28.360 --> 05:30.112
...if your future was more certain...

05:33.000 --> 05:34.274
Okay.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.677
Go ahead. Call her.

05:36.840 --> 05:38.956
Get married. Have babies.
Have a great life.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.352
What do I care? I'm finished.

05:41.520 --> 05:43.511
It's all over for me.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.797
In fact...

05:46.960 --> 05:49.030
...let's end it right now.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.553
Jerry...

05:50.720 --> 05:52.199
...kill me.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.276
Kill me now. I'm begging you.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.113
Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.

05:58.280 --> 06:01.158
Just take the pillow
and put it over my face.

06:05.440 --> 06:06.429
Well...

06:07.080 --> 06:09.594
- What, kind of like this?
- What...? What are you...?

06:10.440 --> 06:11.555
Jerry! Hey!

06:14.880 --> 06:15.869
Jerry!

06:18.640 --> 06:21.632
Elaine. What are you doing here?

06:24.520 --> 06:26.112
Jerk-off.

06:28.520 --> 06:32.149
There's nothing wrong with him.
I saw the doctor. He's fine.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.796
Hi, George.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.076
How you feeling?

06:39.560 --> 06:42.393
Is anybody getting your apartment?

06:44.760 --> 06:47.069
I'll tell you, if I ever get out of here...

06:47.240 --> 06:49.390
...l'm gonna change my life.

06:49.560 --> 06:52.358
I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.238
Take up yoga.

06:55.520 --> 06:57.988
Meditate. I'll eat right.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.830
Calm down, you know?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.070
Lose my anger.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.555
Hey, is anybody listening?!

07:13.000 --> 07:14.274
Hello.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.553
Mr. Costanza.

07:17.720 --> 07:18.914
Excuse me.

07:19.080 --> 07:22.231
Yeah, you know, doc, I gotta tell you,
I feel a lot better.

07:22.600 --> 07:26.593
Well, we looked at your EKGs, ran
some tests, did a complete workup.

07:26.760 --> 07:28.193
Oh, God. Mommy.

07:31.360 --> 07:33.476
Well, you simply haven't had
a heart attack.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.833
I haven't?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.319
I'm okay?

07:37.480 --> 07:39.516
I'm okay? Oh, thank you!

07:39.680 --> 07:41.318
Thank you!

07:41.480 --> 07:42.913
I don't know how to thank you!

07:43.160 --> 07:46.277
Hey, that was really fun, George.
Can we go home now?

07:46.440 --> 07:49.477
No, we'd like to keep him overnight
for observation, just to be safe.

07:49.640 --> 07:50.834
Oh, sure, sure, anything.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.036
Can you believe it?
Nothing's wrong with me.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.517
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.234
What?

07:57.400 --> 07:58.628
Oh, my God. What?

07:58.800 --> 08:00.028
Is it meningitis?

08:00.200 --> 08:01.349
Scoliosis?

08:01.520 --> 08:03.272
Lupus? Is it lupus?!

08:03.720 --> 08:06.029
Have you ever had your tonsils
taken out?

08:06.440 --> 08:07.998
My tonsils?

08:08.160 --> 08:09.479
Yeah, when I was a kid.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.877
Well, they've grown back.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.632
And your adenoids are swollen too.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.558
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:15.720 --> 08:19.713
- Oh, whose tonsils grow back?
- It happens.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.314
Yeah, if you've been exposed
to gamma rays.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.633
I still have my tonsils.

08:24.800 --> 08:26.279
Everyone in my family has theirs.

08:26.440 --> 08:29.591
In fact, we were forbidden
to socialize with anybody...

08:29.760 --> 08:31.512
...who didn't have their tonsils.

08:31.680 --> 08:35.070
That's interesting, because no one
in my family has their tonsils.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.118
And we were forbidden to socialize
with tonsil people.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.590
Well, it's like the Capulets
and the Montagues.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.993
Excuse me.

08:49.760 --> 08:52.069
Anyway, I strongly recommend
they come out.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.478
What? You mean, with a knife?

08:55.040 --> 08:57.429
Yes, with a knife.
You know, snip, snip.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.559
Anyway, you'd be completely under.
You wouldn't feel a thing.

09:01.720 --> 09:03.870
And when you wake up,
you can have some ice cream.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.429
Yeah, that's what they told me
the last time.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.353
Think about it.

09:08.720 --> 09:09.948
Excuse me.

09:10.120 --> 09:11.838
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

09:25.440 --> 09:29.513
I just have to ask that doctor
one more...

09:29.680 --> 09:31.079
...question.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.119
Women go after doctors
like men go after models.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.238
They want someone with knowledge
of the body. We just want the body.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.715
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:43.880 --> 09:44.995
Boy...

09:45.160 --> 09:47.549
...they got a great cafeteria
downstairs.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.280
Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.

09:50.440 --> 09:52.829
It's like Sizzler opened up a hospital.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.474
Boy...

09:55.640 --> 09:57.358
So how did you have a heart attack?

09:57.920 --> 09:59.876
You're a young man.

10:00.040 --> 10:01.792
What were you doing?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.439
They gonna do a zipper job?

10:03.600 --> 10:06.273
- Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
- Kramer.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.477
You know, the really bad thing
about the heart is the sex thing.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.471
See, you gotta be careful
about sex now.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.153
You get that heart pumping...

10:14.040 --> 10:15.712
Suddenly, boom!
Next thing you know...

10:15.880 --> 10:19.395
...you got a hose coming out of your
chest attached to a piece of luggage.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.675
Kramer, George didn't have
a heart attack.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.717
No? That's good.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.030
I have to have my tonsils taken out.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.471
Oh, man. No.

10:29.640 --> 10:32.074
George, we gotta get you out of here.
Get out right now.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.639
They'll kill you in here.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.353
It's routine surgery.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.034
Oh, yeah?
My friend Bob Sacamano...

10:39.200 --> 10:41.953
...he came in here
for a hernia operation.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.872
Oh, yeah, "routine surgery."

10:44.040 --> 10:46.076
Now he's sitting in a chair
by a window going:

10:46.240 --> 10:47.832
"My name is Bob!"

10:50.000 --> 10:52.560
George, whatever you do,
don't let them cut you.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.438
Don't let them cut you.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.033
Well, what should I do, Kramer?

10:56.200 --> 10:58.919
- For one thing, don't listen to him.
- I'll tell you what you do.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.635
I'll tell you what you do.
You go to Tor Ackman.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.552
Tor. He'll fix you right up.

11:03.720 --> 11:05.790
He's an herbalist, a healer, George.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.235
He's not just gonna fix the tonsils
and the adenoids.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.073
He is gonna change
the whole way you function.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.958
Body and mind.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.836
Ackman? I thought he was doing time.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.275
No, no, he's out. He got out.

11:20.520 --> 11:22.909
See, the medical establishment...

11:23.120 --> 11:27.238
See, they tried to frame him.
It's all politics, but he's a rebel.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.118
A rebel?

11:29.280 --> 11:31.350
No, Johnny Yuma was a rebel.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.636
Ackman is a nut.

11:33.800 --> 11:37.315
You wanna take care of your tonsils,
do it in a hospital with a doctor.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.754
He's holistic.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.990
George, he's holistic.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.511
- Holistic?
- Yeah.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.797
That sounds right.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.155
George, you need a medical doctor.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.117
Let me ask you something.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.113
How much do you think it would cost
to have tonsils and adenoids...

11:53.280 --> 11:54.952
...removed in a hospital?

11:55.120 --> 11:58.078
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital,
minor surgery, I don't know...

11:58.240 --> 11:59.673
...four grand?

12:00.680 --> 12:04.639
- How much does the healer charge?
- First visit? 38 bucks.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.312
Oh, yeah. Holistic.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.436
That's what I need.
That's the answer.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.792
You like the way I talked you
into coming?

12:17.960 --> 12:19.393
Don't flatter yourself,
my friend.

12:19.560 --> 12:21.869
I'm here strictly for material.
And I have a feeling...

12:22.040 --> 12:25.476
...this is a potential gold mine.
I still think you're nuts, though.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.996
All I know is, I've been going to doctors
all my life. What's it gotten me?

12:30.160 --> 12:32.390
I'm 33, I haven't outgrown
the problems of puberty...

12:32.560 --> 12:34.471
...l'm already facing
the problems of old age.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.393
I completely skipped
healthy adulthood.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.916
I went from having orgasms
immediately to taking forever.

12:41.080 --> 12:44.470
You can do your taxes in the time
it takes me to have an orgasm.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.596
I never had a normal...

12:46.760 --> 12:48.034
...medium orgasm.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.515
I never had a really good pickle.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.753
Besides, what's it gonna cost me,
38 bucks?

13:09.600 --> 13:11.591
Would you not put your foot
on that, please?

13:11.760 --> 13:13.159
Sorry.

13:19.960 --> 13:22.315
- What month were you born?
- April.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.994
You should have been born
in August.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.678
Your parents would have been
well-advised to wait.

13:30.280 --> 13:31.679
Really?

13:34.560 --> 13:36.516
Do you use hot water in the shower?

13:37.480 --> 13:40.358
- Yes.
- Stop using it.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.836
- Okay.
- I'm off hot water.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.118
Kramer tells me that you are interested
in an alternative to surgery.

13:49.280 --> 13:50.759
Yes. Yes, I am.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.712
I think we can help you.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.914
See, unfortunately,
the medical establishment...

14:03.080 --> 14:05.355
...is a business
like any other business.

14:05.520 --> 14:07.715
And business needs customers.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.996
They want to sell you
their most expensive item...

14:10.160 --> 14:12.037
...which is unnecessary surgery.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.716
Can I use hot water on my face?

14:16.880 --> 14:18.632
No. You know...

14:18.800 --> 14:21.314
...I am not a businessman.

14:21.480 --> 14:24.870
I am a holistic healer.
It's a calling. It's a gift.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.713
You see, it's in the best interest
of the medical profession...

14:27.880 --> 14:31.714
...that you remain sick.
See, that insures good business.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.110
You're not a patient,
you're a customer.

14:34.280 --> 14:37.317
And you're not a doctor,
but you play one in real life.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.148
What about shaving?

14:41.320 --> 14:43.914
You're eating too much dairy.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.553
May I?

14:47.040 --> 14:48.678
I guess so.

14:58.440 --> 14:59.714
You see?

15:02.080 --> 15:04.196
You are in disharmony.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.430
The throat is the gateway to the lung.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.672
Tonsillitis, adenoiditis is,
in Chinese medical terms...

15:09.840 --> 15:11.592
...an invasion of heat and wind.

15:11.760 --> 15:14.399
There's some hot air blowing
in here.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.154
You know...

15:17.320 --> 15:20.198
...I lived with the Eskimos
many years ago...

15:20.360 --> 15:23.272
...and they used to plunge their faces
into the snow.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.030
Can it be lukewarm?

15:28.960 --> 15:32.839
Too much dairy? You really think
I'm eating too much dairy.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.069
The tongue.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.673
Yes, the tongue.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.513
Or, in medical terms, the glossa.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.033
It's a muscular organ.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.553
Consists of two parts:

15:43.720 --> 15:46.439
The body and the root.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.396
You see, it's covered
by this mucous membrane.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.518
These raised little projections here
are the papillae.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.951
It's what gives it
its furred appearance.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.348
Very tactile.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.551
Your tea is ready now.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.598
This will solve your so-called
tonsil problem.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.353
It's a special concoction.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.080
- It contains cramp bark.
- I love cramp bark.

16:11.640 --> 16:12.834
Cleavers.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.515
Cleaver? I once had cleaver as a kid.
I was able to lift a car.

16:16.920 --> 16:18.273
And some couch grass.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.510
Couch grass and cramp bark?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.272
I think that's what killed Curly.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.279
Go ahead, drink it, George.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.671
Excuse me. Tor?

16:30.840 --> 16:33.115
May I ask you a question?

16:33.280 --> 16:35.555
You have intuitive abilities.

16:35.720 --> 16:39.076
You're in touch with a lot
of cosmic kind of things.

16:39.240 --> 16:42.915
I have this note I can't read.
I was wondering if...

16:45.800 --> 16:47.392
Yes!

16:48.680 --> 16:51.717
"Cleveland, 117. San Antonio, 109."

16:57.800 --> 16:59.074
Go ahead, George, drink it.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.071
It's not too bad.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.038
I'm an eggplant!

17:13.200 --> 17:15.714
I'm an eggplant! I'm a vegetable!

17:15.880 --> 17:17.074
I didn't take your Chuckle!

17:17.240 --> 17:20.516
I had five Chuckles. I ate the green
and the yellow. The red is missing.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.398
- I don't even like Chuckles!
- Maybe he doesn't like them.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.119
My face! My face!
Get me to the hospital!

17:26.280 --> 17:27.679
I want that Chuckle, you hear?

17:27.839 --> 17:29.512
You want me to get you a Chuckle?

17:29.680 --> 17:31.079
- Pull over.
- Pull over?

17:31.240 --> 17:33.151
- "Pull over"? You want a piece of me?
- Yeah!

17:33.320 --> 17:35.390
- What, you're gonna fight?
- No! I'm a mutant!

17:36.760 --> 17:39.274
- Let me drive.
- Come on, man, pull over!

17:39.440 --> 17:41.317
All right. I'm gonna
mess you up, man!

17:41.480 --> 17:42.754
Really, gentlemen, please.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.353
My heart!

17:44.520 --> 17:46.078
Where are you going?!
Are you crazy?!

17:46.240 --> 17:48.356
- I'm gonna kick his ass!
- Hey, do you have keys?

17:48.520 --> 17:50.750
You can't leave!
This is an ambulance!

17:50.920 --> 17:53.559
- This is an emergency!
- I don't like Chuckles, man.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.792
If I hear you one more time,
I'm gonna kill you!

17:56.960 --> 17:59.952
- All this over a Chuckle.
- What's a Chuckle?

18:00.120 --> 18:03.317
It's a jelly candy.
Comes in five flavours.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.112
You see, taste buds run
on grooves along surfaces.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.918
- Can you let go of my tongue now?
- What?

18:12.080 --> 18:15.834
- Let go of my tongue.
- Oh, sorry.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.911
Well, I should get going.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.599
- What are you doing?
- I was gonna kiss you good night.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.189
A kiss?

18:24.360 --> 18:28.956
With the tongue? The glossa
with the bumps and the papillae?

18:30.560 --> 18:32.232
I don't think so.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.552
- You can't just leave him there.
- I told him I was gonna mess him up.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.678
- Can you call him an ambulance?
- I told him I didn't take his Chuckle!

18:40.840 --> 18:43.354
- I don't eat that gooey crap!
- Hey, watch the road.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.988
- Watch the road, man.
- Hey, you want some of what he got?

18:46.160 --> 18:48.276
- Hey, watch out!
- Watch out!

19:01.520 --> 19:03.238
How you doing?

19:04.040 --> 19:05.598
Can't talk?

19:06.400 --> 19:08.072
Hey, how'd you get the plastic one?

19:11.240 --> 19:12.992
I like that.

19:15.480 --> 19:17.152
So how's life without tonsils?

19:19.840 --> 19:21.512
What? What's that?

19:22.160 --> 19:24.674
So how much is this thing gonna
cost you, like 5000, 6000?

19:28.760 --> 19:31.797
Well, live and learn.
At least we lived.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.750
Kramer went to Ackman.
He feels all better already.

19:39.920 --> 19:41.831
What? What are you doing?

19:43.600 --> 19:46.797
Oh, poor George.

19:46.960 --> 19:51.636
I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't want to run into Dr. Tongue.

19:52.280 --> 19:55.875
Here, I brought you something.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.753
See?

19:59.480 --> 20:01.994
- Oh, please, come on. It's nothing.
- Hey, turn up the TV.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.718
The planet's on fire!

20:03.880 --> 20:05.950
It is just as you prophesised.

20:06.120 --> 20:09.317
The planets of our solar system
incinerating...

20:09.680 --> 20:15.357
...lik e flaming globes, Zigmond,
lik e flaming globes!

20:17.000 --> 20:20.037
That's it! That's it!
"Flaming globes of Zigmond"!

20:20.200 --> 20:24.352
That's my note.
That's what I thought was so funny.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.636
It's not funny.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.113
There's nothing funny about that.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.271
Shut up!

20:34.760 --> 20:38.230
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac.
Always thinks he's sick, never is.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.038
Then you have another type
of person...

20:40.200 --> 20:42.634
...always thinks they're well,
no matter how bad they are.

20:42.800 --> 20:45.951
You know this type of person?
Very annoying. "Feel great.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.634
I like being on a respirator.

20:48.800 --> 20:52.395
Intravenous, heart-lung machine.
I never felt better in my life."

20:53.080 --> 20:58.438
Medical science is making advances
every day to control health problems.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.591
In fact, it's probably only
a matter of time...

21:00.760 --> 21:03.593
...before a heart attack
becomes like a headache.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.952
We'll just see people on TV going:

21:06.120 --> 21:08.793
"I had a heart attack this big...

21:09.640 --> 21:12.677
...but I gave myself
one of these: Clear!

21:13.320 --> 21:15.117
And it's gone."
