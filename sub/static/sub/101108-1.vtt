00:22.128 --> 00:24.230
What are you doing?

00:24.263 --> 00:26.132
- I'm getting a condom.
- No. You don't need that.

00:26.999 --> 00:28.435
Okay. Why would I not need that?

00:34.240 --> 00:35.675
Let me get one...

00:35.709 --> 00:38.378
- You don't need one.
- I swear we have... why do you keep saying that?

00:39.311 --> 00:41.448
Because we don't.

00:43.349 --> 00:46.686
Would you relax or something?
I feel like... there it is.

00:46.720 --> 00:48.254
Okay. There it is.

00:53.325 --> 00:54.694
Right there.

00:57.697 --> 00:58.698
Right there.

00:59.265 --> 01:01.100
Oh, yeah.

01:10.710 --> 01:11.578
What's wrong?

01:13.112 --> 01:16.716
It just doesn't feel
as good this way.

01:17.283 --> 01:19.251
Well, it doesn't feel as good
for me either.

01:19.285 --> 01:21.721
But you're off the pills,
so this is what we gotta do.

01:26.225 --> 01:27.960
Just do it and pull out.

01:36.436 --> 01:38.705
You know I can still get
you pregnant like this.

01:38.738 --> 01:41.140
Jeff, it is impossible to get
pregnant from pre-cum.

01:41.173 --> 01:44.076
Not with my guys. What if they're
like the Michael Phelps of semen?

01:44.109 --> 01:47.146
Okay, giving yourself
a little too much credit.

01:47.179 --> 01:50.784
Also I'm turning 35 in a month,
it is not that easy.

01:50.817 --> 01:53.219
We could be having sex for a
year before I get pregnant.

01:53.252 --> 01:55.789
And even then there's a 50
percent chance of miscarriage.

01:55.822 --> 01:58.391
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:03.128 --> 02:07.400
Also my doctor says that I'd officially
be considered a geriatric pregnancy

02:07.434 --> 02:08.267
because of my age.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.737
Okay, I'm starting
to lose my erection.

02:10.770 --> 02:13.740
We're gonna start trying soon but you
need to stop saying geriatric, okay?

02:13.773 --> 02:15.675
Let's go. Let's go.

02:15.709 --> 02:17.309
Yeah.

02:18.077 --> 02:18.879
Yeah.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.182
We haven't done this
in a long time.

02:24.484 --> 02:26.419
- Feels good, right?
- Uh-huh.

02:26.453 --> 02:27.721
Cum inside me.

02:30.155 --> 02:31.625
- What...
- Wait, what?

02:31.658 --> 02:35.094
Cum inside you? That wa... that was
the moment we decided to have a kid?

02:35.127 --> 02:36.830
Yeah. What did you think
the moment would be like?

02:36.863 --> 02:39.298
I figured there'd be some
talking involved.

02:40.433 --> 02:43.403
Okay. We have talked about it
many times.

02:43.436 --> 02:46.406
- You said you wanted to have kids.
- I do. I do. One day.

02:47.106 --> 02:49.275
Okay. It's a day.

02:57.517 --> 03:00.453
You know we're never gonna be
totally ready, right?

03:04.323 --> 03:06.325
That is not an attractive look.

03:07.293 --> 03:08.327
Okay, how about now?

03:11.297 --> 03:13.400
Okay, why did you stop taking
birth control anyway?

03:13.433 --> 03:16.803
Because if we want to start trying to
get pregnant in the next few months,

03:16.836 --> 03:20.139
I gotta get my hormones
in check, you know?

03:20.172 --> 03:24.343
Get my cycles right, start having
regular periods, get the eggs dropping.

03:24.377 --> 03:27.480
Oh, hey, I'm sorry I... I couldn't hear
you. Did you just say next few months?

03:27.514 --> 03:28.815
Well, you said soon.

03:28.848 --> 03:30.717
Okay, well soon could
be next year.

03:31.418 --> 03:36.188
We've been together since I turned
30 and you have said that annually.

03:36.723 --> 03:38.391
I definitely didn't
say that year one.

03:39.759 --> 03:43.396
I don't get it. I mean,
you have a stable job, it pays the bills.

03:43.430 --> 03:44.631
I don't see what the issue is.

03:44.664 --> 03:48.367
The issue is once we have a kid,
I'm locked in supporting it

03:48.401 --> 03:51.170
and then the next thing you know
I'm retired and I've wasted my life.

03:51.203 --> 03:53.440
I mean, you don't hate your job
so it's not the same for you.

03:53.473 --> 03:57.410
Well, I don't love my job, Jeff.
I find things I like about it.

03:57.444 --> 04:01.715
I like being outside all day.
I like being my own boss. You try it.

04:03.850 --> 04:04.818
I...

04:05.518 --> 04:07.821
What else
are you gonna do, Jeff?

04:07.854 --> 04:11.491
Your ideal job is
environmental sculpture artist.

04:11.524 --> 04:16.463
There's literally one guy in the entire world
that gets paid to do that. Job's taken.

04:16.495 --> 04:18.832
I should have never shown
you that documentary.

04:18.865 --> 04:21.767
My God, you're never
gonna be happy.

04:21.801 --> 04:23.369
It doesn't have to be that.

04:23.403 --> 04:27.239
I can be happy doing a lot of things as
long as I'm not inside at a desk all day.

04:27.272 --> 04:29.274
You're never gonna be ready.

04:29.809 --> 04:31.176
Okay, maybe not.

04:31.210 --> 04:35.415
Alright, but maybe this entire
proposition makes zero sense, alright?

04:35.448 --> 04:39.686
You spend years trying to find the person
that you love the most in this world,

04:39.719 --> 04:41.454
the person that you
want to spend your life with,

04:41.488 --> 04:43.790
and then for some reason the
two of you conspire to create

04:43.823 --> 04:45.825
a third person that you like
better than each other?

04:45.859 --> 04:47.460
I mean...

04:47.494 --> 04:49.863
I mean literally, gun to your head and
you're both gonna choose your offspring.

04:50.997 --> 04:53.867
Well, that's life, Jeff.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.368
I didn't sign up to live my life
according to a biological clock

04:56.403 --> 04:58.303
that we don't know if
you're reading correctly.

04:58.337 --> 05:01.741
That is exactly what you signed
up for when you married me.

05:01.775 --> 05:03.342
I'm just saying I'm fine with it
either way.

05:03.376 --> 05:06.846
If we have a child, great. If we don't,
that's fine too. I'm committed to us.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.982
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
That is not what you said.

05:09.015 --> 05:12.284
You said,
"Yes, I want to have kids."

05:12.317 --> 05:15.855
Yes, I do want to have kids. I just don't
want to sacrifice my life to do that.

05:19.426 --> 05:22.327
You know, sometimes I... I wonder if
you actually want to have a baby with me

05:22.361 --> 05:23.830
or if you just
want to have a baby period.

05:23.863 --> 05:28.200
Well, don't force me to make the
choice because the baby has the edge.

05:29.836 --> 05:31.137
Still here and I know
you can hear me.

05:31.171 --> 05:34.407
- I can't.
- You can hear me. Those are just covering your eyes.

05:34.441 --> 05:36.308
Your other
senses are still active.

05:56.129 --> 06:00.033
Okay. so, basically the new orders come in
and we route them through four key steps:

06:00.066 --> 06:03.436
upsell, subscription,
processing, fulfillment.

06:03.470 --> 06:06.338
Each sales VP, you guys,
will get clearance from me

06:06.371 --> 06:09.476
before routing to the subsequent
department. Any questions?

06:10.342 --> 06:16.015
- Mm-hmm?
- So why do us "guys," aka vice presidents,

06:16.049 --> 06:19.719
need to get permission
from the manager of new orders?

06:19.753 --> 06:23.022
Well, actually I'm not the manager,
I'm the chief executive of new orders.

06:23.056 --> 06:26.291
So what does that make you?
My... my boss?

06:26.993 --> 06:29.896
Yeah, chief, like I'm the chief
and you're the tribe.

06:30.530 --> 06:32.766
Whoa, are you kidding me?

06:32.799 --> 06:34.200
Was that offensive?
That's an analogy.

06:34.234 --> 06:38.938
Yeah, I'm offended. I did ancestry.com
and I'm one percent Indian.

06:38.972 --> 06:44.343
Okay, okay. Well, I'm pretty sure the proper
term is Native American, so we both misspoke.

06:44.377 --> 06:46.278
Now you're whitesplaining.

06:46.880 --> 06:47.881
Have you seen me?

06:49.082 --> 06:50.617
And I think you're white.

06:50.650 --> 06:55.455
Whoa, whoa, hold on. You're assuming
she identifies that way. It's not okay.

06:55.488 --> 06:59.459
And since you're in a place of
power, I identify you as Caucasian.

06:59.492 --> 07:03.029
- I don't think it works that way.
- Oh, so now you're mansplaining?

07:03.863 --> 07:05.899
I can't correct someone
just because I have a penis?

07:05.932 --> 07:06.866
Okay...

07:06.900 --> 07:09.435
I'm sorry, did I miss
the trigger warning?

07:09.469 --> 07:12.505
I feel like you just pulled your
penis out and it's all up in my face.

07:12.539 --> 07:14.874
I feel like I'm watching you
stick your penis in her face.

07:14.908 --> 07:16.509
My penis is nowhere
near anybody's face.

07:16.543 --> 07:17.510
Pause.

07:20.513 --> 07:22.849
Jeff, why don't you come
take a seat, okay?

07:22.882 --> 07:24.717
- Good job.
- Okay.

07:24.751 --> 07:25.718
Dope stuff, J.

07:25.752 --> 07:27.887
Dope stuff. I'm proud of you.
You're learning.

07:27.921 --> 07:29.856
You guys,
you see what he did there?

07:29.889 --> 07:33.126
Good presentation, de-escalations
when things got tense, alright?

07:33.159 --> 07:36.396
Ashleigh, I felt it. Got to work
on those T-Dubs, J.

07:36.429 --> 07:37.329
Yeah.

07:39.432 --> 07:41.100
- Trigger warnings. Come on.
- That's right.

07:41.134 --> 07:45.772
Look, I... we just had our last leadership
evaluation and sensitivity training, right?

07:46.539 --> 07:47.907
Best weekend of my life, guys.

07:47.941 --> 07:50.076
- Yes, so fun.
- Honestly, take... take me back.

07:50.777 --> 07:54.047
Look, you guys, let's remember
we are farm-to-table, alright?

07:54.080 --> 07:57.016
We put the table in vege-table.

07:57.050 --> 07:58.885
- Yeah.
- I love that.

07:58.918 --> 08:01.855
Alright. Out. Alright?
Carry this on, alright you guys?

08:01.888 --> 08:03.423
I'm sorry for making
assumptions.

08:07.894 --> 08:09.762
- What's up, Triple Play?
- What up, B?

08:09.796 --> 08:11.731
- Keep excelling. You're the man.
- Yeah.

08:11.764 --> 08:14.100
- Hey Ben, you got a minute?
- Look, Jeff, okay,

08:14.133 --> 08:17.136
I understand you wanna emphasize
your title, okay, but as the CEO...

08:17.170 --> 08:20.773
and I don't even like saying that,
okay, it's just customary at this point.

08:20.807 --> 08:22.141
That's not what
we're about here.

08:23.877 --> 08:25.945
It's actually about the field
position that opened up.

08:26.546 --> 08:28.414
You know that's
a step down, right?

08:28.448 --> 08:29.382
Yeah.

08:29.916 --> 08:30.917
Can I show you something?

08:30.950 --> 08:31.918
- Yeah.
- Alright.

08:33.385 --> 08:36.489
Okay, I was digging through some
files last night and I found this.

08:36.522 --> 08:38.524
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

08:38.558 --> 08:41.027
You handed this to me at a
recruitment event ten years ago.

08:41.059 --> 08:43.929
This is what I was picturing when I
went to work at a farm-to-table startup.

08:43.962 --> 08:47.467
I wasn't thinking I'd be actually at
a table crushing analytics all day.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.937
Jeff, I'm sorry, okay? You're
too valuable where you are.

08:51.504 --> 08:54.540
I can't give you
a demotion right now.

09:16.529 --> 09:18.097
Yeah, more like a pro.

09:18.131 --> 09:19.599
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh yeah.

09:19.632 --> 09:22.802
- Put in mouth guards.
- I can't believe you guys still use condoms.

09:22.835 --> 09:24.003
No wonder you
argue during sex.

09:24.037 --> 09:25.204
Well, what are we
supposed to use?

09:25.238 --> 09:27.740
- Rhythm Method.
- Oh, is that that app?

09:27.774 --> 09:30.843
Yeah. I mean basically I record
my period every month

09:30.877 --> 09:34.814
and it gives me the percentage of
chance I have of conceiving each day.

09:34.847 --> 09:36.549
Under one percent
and you don't use anything.

09:36.582 --> 09:38.151
Well, Jeff's afraid of pre-cum.

09:38.184 --> 09:40.053
The app is as effective
as condoms.

09:40.086 --> 09:41.888
- Yeah. And it feels a lot better too.
- Yeah.

09:41.921 --> 09:44.524
And I hate the side effects of the pill.

09:44.557 --> 09:45.825
Oh my God, the worst.

09:47.293 --> 09:51.164
Okay, so what... what if Taylor reads
it wrong, you know, accidentally?

09:51.197 --> 09:53.566
Are you kidding me?
He'd be thrilled.

09:53.599 --> 09:55.868
Then I wouldn't have
to deal with his daily coaxing.

09:56.569 --> 09:58.204
You ready to have kids?

09:58.972 --> 10:02.775
I mean... Yeah.
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

10:02.809 --> 10:06.045
I mean I worry about the cost but my
gym business is doing pretty good.

10:06.079 --> 10:08.281
His sponsorship just got
renewed for Buff It Out.

10:08.314 --> 10:09.949
- Nice.
- Oh.

10:09.983 --> 10:15.021
You know, my pops passed away last year,
my mom's getting older, it just clicked.

10:15.054 --> 10:16.423
I want my kids to know her.

10:16.457 --> 10:19.559
I wait any longer, she'll be 90 by
the time they say their first word.

10:20.093 --> 10:21.561
But you're not ready?

10:22.061 --> 10:24.230
I mean not really.

10:24.263 --> 10:28.167
I'm afraid of what it's gonna do
to my time and my body

10:28.201 --> 10:30.536
and therefore my career.

10:30.570 --> 10:33.539
See? She's in the same boat as me,
trying to make it doing something you love.

10:35.141 --> 10:37.276
Taylor was just chosen
as a principal dancer

10:37.310 --> 10:39.278
for the South Coast
Ballet Company.

10:39.312 --> 10:40.913
She starts next month.

10:40.947 --> 10:42.281
- Congrats!
- Yes.

10:42.315 --> 10:44.050
- It's amazing.
- It's awesome.

10:44.083 --> 10:45.918
- Cheers.
- Don's been super supportive.

10:45.952 --> 10:48.154
I mean he's got me
on the strength training program

10:48.187 --> 10:50.056
and this incredible
nutrition plan.

10:50.089 --> 10:52.291
He makes me like
two smoothies a day.

10:52.325 --> 10:55.028
I've never felt stronger
and more energized.

10:55.061 --> 10:57.030
So you guys are the reverse?

10:57.063 --> 10:57.997
Yep.

10:58.331 --> 10:59.265
Well...

11:00.166 --> 11:02.168
I mean I like the idea
of having kids,

11:02.201 --> 11:05.772
just not the idea of having
kids, if you know what I mean.

11:05.805 --> 11:06.939
Totally.

11:06.973 --> 11:09.075
I mean it's like it crushes
your social circle, right?

11:09.108 --> 11:12.078
Parents have kids and they ditch
their childless friends,

11:12.111 --> 11:14.781
they make new friends
and then they just disappear.

11:14.814 --> 11:16.249
We'd have to have
kids just to see them again.

11:16.282 --> 11:19.185
You know what? I think
they look down on us.

11:19.218 --> 11:21.988
I think you're right.
I think they resent us.

11:22.021 --> 11:23.856
And then we're
forced to resent them

11:23.890 --> 11:26.025
while we're looking at stupid
pictures on their phones.

11:26.059 --> 11:28.594
Jeff, you yourself said
there are some positives.

11:28.628 --> 11:32.031
Okay, yeah there are, there... it's
true, it's true, there're some positives.

11:32.065 --> 11:34.367
As you think it's impossible to
make new friends in your thirties,

11:34.401 --> 11:38.337
all of a sudden you have a kid and it's like
freshman year of college all over again.

11:38.371 --> 11:39.272
New friends every day.

11:39.305 --> 11:40.773
Yeah, and a whole
new business network.

11:40.807 --> 11:44.043
My friend met some investor guy at the
playground and next thing you know,

11:44.077 --> 11:47.180
he's got the startup money.
Kid could be a good business move, Jeff.

11:47.213 --> 11:50.049
Yeah, maybe I can borrow a kid to
schmooze until I have my own one day.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.785
Well, we babysit
for my older sister once a week

11:52.819 --> 11:56.889
so she can go out with her husband,
and like a real night out, they go hard.

11:56.923 --> 11:59.826
- Nice.
- That's why their relationship is still great.

11:59.859 --> 12:03.096
And then I get to hang out with
my little niece who's amazing

12:03.129 --> 12:05.631
and it's all the fun,
none of the tantrums.

12:06.433 --> 12:07.800
Just split it even?

12:07.834 --> 12:09.235
- Yeah.
- Down the middle.

12:10.136 --> 12:13.039
I just feel like as a woman
we wait, and we date

12:13.072 --> 12:15.341
and then you wait some more
and then you break up.

12:15.374 --> 12:18.344
And then you finally find the right person
and you wait and you wait and you wait

12:18.378 --> 12:22.382
and then before you know it, you're having
to consider putting your eggs on ice.

12:35.094 --> 12:36.262
You know what'll be perfect?

12:37.063 --> 12:38.998
What if we could split a baby?

12:39.832 --> 12:41.067
Half a share in one baby?

12:41.968 --> 12:42.969
What?

12:43.002 --> 12:44.837
That would be pretty optimal.

12:45.238 --> 12:47.073
Best of all worlds, really.

12:47.106 --> 12:49.842
Right? I mean we'd have two
completely different sets of friends.

12:50.209 --> 12:53.079
We could trade off day-to-day,
week to week, month to month,

12:53.112 --> 12:55.214
whenever we need it,
right, straddle the line.

12:55.948 --> 13:00.820
Yeah, but wouldn't the kid be a little
confused splitting between all of us?

13:00.853 --> 13:04.056
Well, my parents had joint
custody and I turned out fine.

13:04.090 --> 13:09.862
My mom taught me dance and art and literature
and my dad showed me muscle cars and camping.

13:09.896 --> 13:11.398
But this would be even better.

13:11.431 --> 13:16.102
It's two sets so two moms, two dads
and, you know, no one hates each other.

13:16.135 --> 13:19.071
See? I mean lots of people come
from split families these days,

13:19.105 --> 13:22.308
unconventional families, it's just
that no one's thought of this idea yet.

13:22.341 --> 13:24.844
It's a pretty great idea.

13:24.877 --> 13:26.345
Are there even any cons?

13:26.380 --> 13:31.350
Well, for one, I would want
the whole experience to myself,

13:31.385 --> 13:35.888
you know, like pregnancy,
miracle of childbirth,

13:35.922 --> 13:40.059
creating milk for a little baby
that came out of my body.

13:40.092 --> 13:42.161
You can have all of that.

13:42.862 --> 13:45.932
My issue is I'd only want to do
it if it was my kid genetically.

13:45.965 --> 13:48.201
Well, I mean look
at your genes.

13:48.234 --> 13:51.137
Don was a sperm donor
in college. Tell them.

13:51.170 --> 13:52.905
No. Stop.

13:52.939 --> 13:54.140
He's so modest.

13:54.173 --> 13:55.341
Go on Don, tell us.

13:55.374 --> 13:59.111
Based off of his physique,
his DNA test, his aptitude exam,

13:59.145 --> 14:02.048
let's just say his sperm
was in high demand.

14:02.081 --> 14:04.083
- I believe it.
- Yeah, I believe it.

14:05.851 --> 14:08.254
- Have you ever donated?
- No. Um...

14:08.988 --> 14:13.427
I tried but apparently I'm a carrier of
this rare double earlobe gene in my family,

14:13.460 --> 14:14.961
- so that was...
- Yes.

14:14.994 --> 14:17.196
I've heard about that earlobe.

14:17.964 --> 14:19.932
- His uncle has three.
- He's a triple.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.403
Well, I guess that
settles it, right?

14:24.937 --> 14:26.806
Sure. Let's get started.

14:26.839 --> 14:29.141
- Great.
- You know what, if that's what it took for me

14:29.175 --> 14:32.878
to get pregnant before my next
birthday, I'd consider it.

14:35.114 --> 14:37.984
- Fine. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

14:38.017 --> 14:40.152
That shit happened to me
all the time in Chicago.

14:40.186 --> 14:43.356
- Shit from Chicago, ha ha.
- Alright. We go this way.

14:43.390 --> 14:46.092
- It was so great seeing you.
- Always good to see you.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.193
- See you guys.
- You too, man.

14:47.226 --> 14:49.328
Let's do it again next week.
We're free any night.

14:49.362 --> 14:51.831
- Awesome. So good to see you.
- I'm in.

14:51.864 --> 14:53.032
Don.

14:54.367 --> 14:56.836
And hey, think about
the kid plan.

14:56.869 --> 14:58.137
Splitsies?

14:58.170 --> 14:59.238
Yeah.

15:03.009 --> 15:05.978
- Think about it.
- You're not gonna look at our kids and see Don's face.

15:06.012 --> 15:08.047
No, I'm gonna see
your beautiful face.

15:08.415 --> 15:10.149
- That's sweet.
- I won't.

15:15.921 --> 15:17.290
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

15:19.125 --> 15:23.996
Okay, and hypothetically you'd be okay with our
children not being your biological children?

15:24.398 --> 15:26.433
I said I was fine
with adoption in ten years.

15:27.266 --> 15:29.935
Wait, you're actually serious
about this?

15:29.969 --> 15:32.338
You haven't stopped
talking about it since drinks.

15:32.371 --> 15:34.373
Okay, well, I mean did you see
the difference?

15:34.408 --> 15:36.976
Don and Taylor, they talk to each
other, they talk to us.

15:37.009 --> 15:39.613
With our other friends,
it's just conversations about babies.

15:39.646 --> 15:41.615
Every two seconds they're
pulling out their phones

15:41.648 --> 15:43.282
and showing us pictures
of their kids and I'm like,

15:43.316 --> 15:46.852
"Yeah, okay, I can see your kids are actually
right over there in the other room."

15:46.886 --> 15:49.855
Just, I don't know,
it takes over their lives.

15:51.792 --> 15:56.630
Look at you. Are you waiting
for us? Punky Woofster.

15:56.663 --> 16:01.100
- Hi, baby.
- Come here, you little punky.

16:01.133 --> 16:02.868
Oh, hello.

16:02.902 --> 16:04.070
We missed you.

16:05.237 --> 16:07.273
- My baby muffin.
- Oh, she's posing for you.

16:07.306 --> 16:11.043
- Give me a smile. Smiles. Smiles. Yes.
- Three, two.

16:11.077 --> 16:13.413
Oh, gorg... gorg.
This is our baby.

16:17.016 --> 16:19.185
Time's up.

16:21.354 --> 16:24.090
Wait! Wait!

16:24.123 --> 16:27.059
I'm here!
You can stop writing it.

16:27.993 --> 16:30.262
Don't you have anything better
to do with your time?

16:30.296 --> 16:31.964
This is my job.

16:31.997 --> 16:36.235
I left my son in the car. You... you can't
ticket a car with someone waiting in it.

16:36.268 --> 16:40.206
Well, unless he's getting out and feeding
the meter, doesn't matter where he's at.

16:40.239 --> 16:43.008
And you're
also missing front plates too.

16:43.042 --> 16:44.176
It's double infraction.

16:44.210 --> 16:48.013
Tell you what, I'll let you go
with just the parking fine

16:48.047 --> 16:50.116
if you promise to put a front
plate on this week.

16:50.684 --> 16:52.318
You're a terrible person.

16:53.119 --> 16:55.121
I'm actually
the best at what I do.

16:56.322 --> 16:57.591
And they call me the Pelican

16:57.624 --> 17:01.060
because I'm really good at
spotting my target 50 yards out.

17:01.093 --> 17:06.098
I just ran in for an audition on the
way to drop him off to soccer practice.

17:09.335 --> 17:11.671
You don't even
have kids, do you?

17:12.338 --> 17:16.108
You don't know
what this is all about.

17:16.675 --> 17:20.380
Well, enjoy
your government wages.

17:20.414 --> 17:23.082
I'll be driving home
in my Lexus.

17:23.115 --> 17:24.950
I'm actually paid on commission.

17:26.152 --> 17:28.287
And Lexus is just
a fancy Toyota.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.230
Whoa, look at this. So cool!

18:12.231 --> 18:14.133
Oh my God...

18:14.166 --> 18:17.069
- You just ruined this man's sculpture.
- It's okay. You alright?

18:17.102 --> 18:18.037
I'm sorry. Yeah.

18:19.038 --> 18:21.475
It's okay, just a couple
of hours. It's... it's...

18:21.508 --> 18:23.376
I mean it's very cool indeed.

18:24.310 --> 18:28.080
Alright, let's... let this man
get back to fixing his art.

18:28.113 --> 18:29.683
- It's all good.
- Sorry.

18:30.784 --> 18:33.185
Hey, when we get home,
can we try to make one of those?

18:33.219 --> 18:36.188
Sure we can.
That's called an environmental sculpture.

18:38.224 --> 18:40.159
Nature artists. It's
really famous in...

18:41.160 --> 18:42.061
Yeah?

18:50.837 --> 18:52.405
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:00.179 --> 19:01.781
I'm sorry about the other night.

19:02.716 --> 19:03.517
Me too.

19:08.755 --> 19:10.457
I know you're just scared.

19:11.357 --> 19:13.693
I like our life too.
I don't wanna lose it.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.796
Hey, aren't you going out
with Marie tonight?

19:16.830 --> 19:19.331
Actually, she just called me.

19:19.365 --> 19:23.302
Her and Brad are up for some day
drinking at that magical cocktail bar.

19:23.335 --> 19:24.270
What?

19:25.337 --> 19:27.474
Awesome. Okay, well, I
haven't seen Brad since...

19:27.507 --> 19:30.075
- Since baby number three.
- Before they were outnumbered.

19:30.109 --> 19:31.343
I haven't seen Marie
since then either.

19:31.378 --> 19:35.815
Well, babysitter ends at 10:00,
so we've got like five hours.

19:35.849 --> 19:36.716
Okay great, I'm on it.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.485
Oh, have you seen my jeans,
you know,

19:38.518 --> 19:40.487
the dark ones I got from
the Personal Styling Club?

19:40.520 --> 19:43.423
Your jeans that are more expensive
than mine are in the laundry.

19:43.456 --> 19:47.159
You're not supposed to wash them. You're
supposed to freeze wash them to protect the dye.

19:47.192 --> 19:50.262
I remembered. They are under the
pot stickers in the top shelf.

19:50.296 --> 19:51.230
Got it.

19:51.263 --> 19:53.132
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:53.165 --> 19:54.801
It's so good to see you.

19:54.834 --> 19:58.405
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you. Did we overdress?

19:58.438 --> 19:59.773
No.

19:59.806 --> 20:02.141
No. Okay.

20:02.174 --> 20:03.342
Oh.

20:03.376 --> 20:05.177
Just give me a moment.

20:05.210 --> 20:06.345
Strong.

20:10.483 --> 20:12.419
Mom, open it!

20:12.452 --> 20:14.253
So our babysitter canceled.

20:14.286 --> 20:16.121
- Oh.
- Oh, shit.

20:16.155 --> 20:17.424
- Yeah.
- Can you get another one?

20:17.457 --> 20:19.459
Is there like a Uber
for babysitters?

20:19.492 --> 20:23.763
Okay, look, don't worry, everything is going to be great.

20:23.797 --> 20:25.097
I ordered in some French bistro,

20:25.130 --> 20:27.767
we got bottles of Bordeaux from Brad's boss.

20:27.801 --> 20:30.437
Kids invited some friends over,
we'll just put a movie on for them

20:30.470 --> 20:32.906
and then we'll go around to the
back patio and lock the door,

20:32.939 --> 20:37.176
and it would be like we are
in the south of France.

20:37.209 --> 20:40.212
- We'll make the best of it. We'll be fine.
- Sure.

20:44.183 --> 20:45.885
- Open this door.
- No!

20:48.755 --> 20:50.857
- Let's go around to the backyard.
- Yeah.

20:58.932 --> 21:03.268
Looks like the kids have taken over
the backyard. May we please come in?

21:03.302 --> 21:05.170
Go ahead. Here's your ticket.

21:05.204 --> 21:06.205
Thank you.

21:06.238 --> 21:07.474
Thank you.

21:07.507 --> 21:08.875
Thank you.

21:08.908 --> 21:10.209
- After you.
- Come in.

21:10.242 --> 21:11.478
- May I?
- Of course.

21:11.511 --> 21:13.178
- Thank you.
- May I?

21:13.212 --> 21:14.179
Yes.

21:14.981 --> 21:16.850
Good day. May I?

21:17.384 --> 21:18.918
No ticket, you have
to go that way.

21:37.236 --> 21:38.303
Ah...

21:38.337 --> 21:39.338
Wow.

21:46.513 --> 21:49.214
I pooped my pants.

21:49.248 --> 21:51.350
I pooped my pants!

21:55.955 --> 21:57.857
Enemy troops!

21:58.858 --> 22:01.293
Get him!

22:49.341 --> 22:50.342
Why?

22:51.343 --> 22:52.479
Why?

23:09.963 --> 23:12.031
Woah. Ha! Ha!

23:26.479 --> 23:27.947
Oh...

23:28.982 --> 23:30.049
Hallelujah!

23:34.821 --> 23:36.355
Thank you, princess.

23:36.389 --> 23:39.425
Here we go, Addy. Here we go, Sunky.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.827
Oh, hold on.

23:41.360 --> 23:43.062
- The prince is calling.
- Okay.

23:43.963 --> 23:45.064
Hey. What are you doing?

23:45.098 --> 23:48.067
Just wanted to check in because
I am in the bathroom.

23:48.101 --> 23:49.536
Why?

23:49.569 --> 23:53.840
I was just fucking ambushed.
A children army amassed and attacked me.

23:53.873 --> 23:55.875
Okay, Jeff, they are
just being kids.

23:55.909 --> 23:57.410
Oh, they are being
kids. Yeah, yeah.

23:57.443 --> 23:59.045
<i>South of France, huh?</i>

23:59.078 --> 24:03.016
I think our geography was a little bit off
because it felt like I was in Normandy.

24:03.049 --> 24:07.921
Okay, well, I'm in the den during princess
teatime while Marie gets the kids settled

24:07.954 --> 24:10.857
and then we'll have dinner just
the four of us, okay? Relax.

24:10.890 --> 24:12.425
Relax? Yeah.

24:12.458 --> 24:15.862
<i>I was gonna ask you, how did you get
that ticket, was there a pre-sale list?</i>

24:15.895 --> 24:17.764
The food's here.
Meet me in the kitchen.

24:17.797 --> 24:18.898
<i>Get me a new shirt.</i>

24:20.900 --> 24:22.802
Sorry, where were we?

24:26.039 --> 24:27.507
Tada!

24:28.808 --> 24:30.476
- Oh.
- Hey.

24:30.510 --> 24:32.912
Sorry about that.
I saw you out there.

24:32.946 --> 24:36.549
I was rooting for you. Oh my goodness.
Have you met Kendra?

24:36.583 --> 24:37.851
I don't believe so. Hi.

24:37.884 --> 24:40.854
Kendra's here selling us magazine
subscriptions for school.

24:40.887 --> 24:43.790
Oh, cool, yeah, I used to do
that in junior high.

24:43.823 --> 24:46.759
- It's called middle school, idiot.
- Wow.

24:47.894 --> 24:51.965
"We can beat sarcoma." So is
that like your rival school?

24:51.998 --> 24:55.134
No, it's a rare form of muscular
cancer that my friend is dying from.

24:55.168 --> 24:58.004
I'm raising awareness.
You know what, I'm leaving.

24:58.037 --> 25:00.874
- Bye. Thanks for coming. Bye.
- Bye, Kendra.

25:00.907 --> 25:05.478
Wow, teenagers, right?

25:05.511 --> 25:07.080
Awareness mission accomplished.

25:07.113 --> 25:09.015
See what I have to look forward
to in a few years?

25:09.048 --> 25:10.283
Um, so where's Brad?

25:10.316 --> 25:13.887
Oh, he's putting the little one
down. Just relax, have a drink.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.755
I put a clean shirt for you
on the counter.

25:15.788 --> 25:16.956
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:16.990 --> 25:19.926
Can you get the bottle
in there? I need a refill.

25:19.959 --> 25:23.529
Oh hey. Looks like we're halfway through.
You're missing out, bud.

25:23.563 --> 25:29.502
Marie, she's out of the bottle. She's just
not... she's not into the father feeder.

25:29.535 --> 25:32.171
I already fed her. Just
put her in the Pack 'n Play.

25:33.206 --> 25:35.775
- Buddy, how you doing, dude?
- What's up?

25:35.808 --> 25:39.145
- Whoa, whoa, don't crush the baby, man.
- Yeah, of course.

25:39.178 --> 25:40.446
Saw the baby. I saw her.

25:40.480 --> 25:42.482
Let's eat. He'll join us later.

25:42.515 --> 25:44.083
- Let me help.
- Wanna grab my wine?

25:44.117 --> 25:46.519
Okay. Okay. Come on.

25:50.957 --> 25:52.892
I think there is one more.

25:53.493 --> 25:55.461
- Oh.
- Oh.

25:55.495 --> 25:58.998
Oh! She's so adorable.

25:59.799 --> 26:02.035
- She's very expressive.
- Yeah.

26:02.068 --> 26:04.771
- Look at them.
- Oh, there's more?

26:04.804 --> 26:05.838
Yeah.

26:05.872 --> 26:09.175
She was just so cute back then.

26:09.208 --> 26:14.814
Oh hey, Ty, another choice, please.

26:15.548 --> 26:19.052
Ty, think about your choice.
You guys want dessert?

26:19.085 --> 26:20.286
- Sure.
- Yeah.

26:20.320 --> 26:24.157
- Thank you.
- Alternate choice. Alternate choice.

26:26.225 --> 26:28.261
We talked about this,
remember?

26:28.294 --> 26:30.897
Okay? Next time I'd appreciate
a better choice.

26:30.930 --> 26:34.934
Right. No, we don't really want
to say anything negative.

26:35.601 --> 26:39.539
Basically the foundation for CCPP
is that everything a child does is right.

26:39.572 --> 26:42.008
Come on, clean better.

26:43.242 --> 26:46.546
Maybe you can encourage
them to make a better choice.

26:46.579 --> 26:49.549
- So you're not saying like "no"?
- Right.

26:49.582 --> 26:51.918
We keep telling him
but it's hard.

26:51.951 --> 26:57.223
You know, you're not supposed to say
it's wrong, it's just another choice.

26:59.258 --> 27:00.593
You're not gonna wash that?

27:02.061 --> 27:03.763
Honey, this was delicious.

27:03.796 --> 27:04.530
Oh yeah.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.769
I have been waiting for this.

27:09.802 --> 27:12.005
Sarah. Sarah.

27:12.939 --> 27:16.976
So, have you guys seen the new
season of our favorite show yet?

27:17.010 --> 27:19.178
No, we haven't.

27:19.212 --> 27:23.282
We have been watching this
Netflix documentary on education.

27:23.316 --> 27:26.052
- Yeah.
- You know, charter schools, school choice.

27:26.085 --> 27:27.454
- Really fascinating.
- Yeah, it is.

27:27.488 --> 27:30.156
It's tough trying to figure out
our parenting paradigm this way.

27:30.189 --> 27:32.892
I hear that's a really tough one.

27:32.925 --> 27:34.127
They are doing
a chemical...

27:34.160 --> 27:37.330
- Anti-imagination thing, yeah.
- Anti-imagination.

27:37.363 --> 27:39.298
- We don't know.
- What are you doing?

27:39.332 --> 27:41.267
Right now it's CCPP.

27:42.802 --> 27:44.237
Oh, come on.

27:45.905 --> 27:47.206
Load me up.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.912
Hey, what are they doing? What
are they doing over there?

27:52.945 --> 27:55.915
Hey guys, it's adult time.
They are fine.

27:55.948 --> 27:58.217
I think someone needs
to tell them to... to stop.

27:58.251 --> 27:59.886
Am I loaded?

27:59.919 --> 28:01.921
Loaded and standing by.

28:01.954 --> 28:05.258
I think I'm gonna go to the restroom
for a little bit, might be a lot of it.

28:05.291 --> 28:06.225
Yeah.

28:06.259 --> 28:08.227
Fire in the hole!

28:08.261 --> 28:09.796
No, no.

28:09.829 --> 28:11.864
Yes! Yes!

28:13.332 --> 28:14.834
It's my jeans.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.869
- Okay, you know what?
- Got you!

28:16.903 --> 28:20.039
- Un-cool choice.
- Although I'm impressed that you got that to work.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.941
I've been
working on that for a week.

28:22.975 --> 28:24.310
That's it?

28:24.343 --> 28:27.947
That's CCPP, it's collaborative,
constructive, permissive parenting.

28:27.980 --> 28:30.016
I'm not gonna punish
my kids for being creative.

28:30.049 --> 28:31.150
So you're not
gonna do anything?

28:31.184 --> 28:33.786
Don't worry though, it's just
a bleach bottle bazooka.

28:33.820 --> 28:37.990
You know it's a little vinegar, some
baking soda, maybe a tiny bit of bleach.

28:38.024 --> 28:39.125
Let me try something.

28:40.126 --> 28:43.096
- That was a terrible choice.
- Oh Jeff.

28:43.129 --> 28:45.298
No, you've upset them.

28:53.806 --> 28:55.942
That was a bit much, I agree.

28:56.876 --> 28:58.911
See? We can find common ground.

29:00.980 --> 29:02.281
Well, we wouldn't be like that.

29:04.884 --> 29:06.319
I need a drink.

29:09.088 --> 29:12.859
And yes, I know, I wouldn't be
able to do that if I was pregnant.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.273
Hey. They're out of Pacifico.

29:31.210 --> 29:33.946
I'm not drinking anything
called Yeast Perfection.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.216
I think it has a nice finish.

29:42.088 --> 29:43.156
Hey, what's wrong?

29:44.290 --> 29:46.058
This is great, right? I mean
we're out on a weeknight.

29:46.092 --> 29:48.127
This stuff right here we
can't do if we have a kid.

29:50.096 --> 29:51.964
I'm cold and this music sucks.

29:51.998 --> 29:53.065
Okay, well, take my jacket.

29:53.099 --> 29:54.834
No, keep that on.

29:57.837 --> 29:58.371
Hey.

29:59.972 --> 30:03.009
What's up? What's going on? What went
wrong since we got here ten minutes ago?

30:03.042 --> 30:06.913
Just got an email
from Dr. Palmer. Test results.

30:07.313 --> 30:09.115
The three thousand dollar test?

30:10.116 --> 30:11.884
You said that we were gonna
wait on that.

30:11.918 --> 30:14.020
Well, my mom said they should
pay for half of it

30:14.053 --> 30:17.924
and I'm glad she did because now I
found out that my egg count is low.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.226
How low?

30:20.259 --> 30:22.895
Low enough that he said it's
in the middle range.

30:22.929 --> 30:25.331
Okay. Well, then it's in the middle.
That's just great.

30:25.364 --> 30:30.102
No, middle is bad, high is good.
Also my egg quality isn't good, it's fair.

30:30.136 --> 30:34.173
Okay, well high is above average.
And fair means it's probably fine.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.209
No, fair is not good.

30:36.242 --> 30:38.144
- Okay, well what's below fair?
- Poor.

30:38.177 --> 30:40.046
Well, we're not poor,
we're fair.

30:40.079 --> 30:41.314
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:41.347 --> 30:43.349
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey, where's Tay?

30:43.383 --> 30:45.452
We got some bad news today.

30:47.421 --> 30:49.389
Doc says her egg count is low.

30:50.156 --> 30:52.959
Wait, did you guys go together?

30:52.992 --> 30:57.296
I told her about the test at drinks last
week. She said she might do it. How low?

30:57.330 --> 30:59.232
She can't have kids.

31:00.833 --> 31:02.068
I'm so sorry.

31:02.101 --> 31:03.336
I'm sorry.

31:09.242 --> 31:13.145
Maybe we should talk seriously about
that thing that we talked about.

31:13.179 --> 31:14.113
Jeff.

31:15.382 --> 31:17.350
No, no, it's... it's okay.

31:19.118 --> 31:22.255
I thought we were all just kind
of joking around

31:22.288 --> 31:26.325
but Taylor
kept talking about it and now...

31:26.359 --> 31:28.294
Hold on, hold on, wait.

31:28.327 --> 31:31.197
You... you guys are actually
serious about this?

31:31.230 --> 31:35.835
I mean it's not ideal but better our
friend's DNA than some random egg donor.

31:35.868 --> 31:37.236
I'm totally serious about this.

31:37.270 --> 31:40.339
And you always said you're a free
spirit, you don't conform to norms.

31:40.373 --> 31:42.008
Well, I am.

31:42.041 --> 31:45.144
Okay, then why treat this like
it's not an actual option?

31:45.177 --> 31:47.213
I mean we all got
our reservations and concerns

31:47.246 --> 31:49.015
but we talked
about the pros and cons.

31:49.048 --> 31:50.950
Cons: it's not my DNA.

31:50.983 --> 31:52.018
I would trade that
for the pros.

31:52.051 --> 31:55.821
Finances, free time,
social life, career, sleep.

31:55.855 --> 31:56.423
Fine.

32:01.395 --> 32:02.462
Fine?

32:03.362 --> 32:05.298
If you're all in, I'm in.

32:12.138 --> 32:13.139
Is it working?

32:17.343 --> 32:19.078
Is it working?

32:19.111 --> 32:20.112
Nope.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.150
Okay, what about now?

32:29.523 --> 32:31.957
I don't even know why they let baby boomers...
is that what it is, I don't know.

32:31.991 --> 32:34.327
I don't even know why they let
them touch the computer,

32:34.360 --> 32:38.097
like they don't know anything about
technology. They never grew up with this.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.865
I know. It's like my mom.

32:39.899 --> 32:41.067
I'm not a baby boomer.

32:42.335 --> 32:43.903
Is it working now?

32:47.940 --> 32:49.075
That's it.

32:49.108 --> 32:50.976
Great. Okay, cool. Fine.

32:51.010 --> 32:54.313
So let me ask you this. If you got
to this page, what would you think?

32:56.215 --> 32:58.084
You three designed
the page, right?

32:59.686 --> 33:03.989
So imagine you get to this page for the
very first time, what would you think?

33:08.928 --> 33:10.096
Can I get a minute?

33:10.129 --> 33:11.864
- Yeah.
- Yeah, take all the time you need.

33:13.667 --> 33:16.168
You're not gonna...

33:20.674 --> 33:24.378
- Hey.
- <i>Jeff Penaras? It's Cicero Jones.</i>

33:24.411 --> 33:26.178
- <i>You remember me, don't you?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

33:26.212 --> 33:29.081
<i>Listen, I got a life-changing
financial opportunity for you.</i>

33:29.115 --> 33:30.684
- <i>You interested?</i>
- Definitely.

33:30.717 --> 33:31.984
<i>Send me your resume
when you got a second.</i>

33:32.017 --> 33:35.087
- Yeah, yeah, I'll send it over ASAP.
- <i>Awesome, bro.</i>

33:37.156 --> 33:40.960
Hi. I'm here to meet...
there he is. Thank you.

33:42.094 --> 33:44.130
- How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

33:44.163 --> 33:46.932
- Wonderful.
- Good to see you. What are you, rolling from a funeral?

33:46.966 --> 33:49.235
I'm coming from the office,
boss likes to keep it professional.

33:49.268 --> 33:51.370
Well, get ready to lose boss
from your vocabulary.

33:51.405 --> 33:53.072
Well, tell me all about it.

33:53.105 --> 33:57.143
You've been pretty cryptic on the phone, I
don't even know what I'm interviewing for.

33:57.176 --> 33:58.578
Oh, this isn't a job interview.

33:58.612 --> 34:02.181
Oh. You said you had a life-changing
financial opportunity for me.

34:02.214 --> 34:04.316
Yeah, this isn't a job,
it's a way of life.

34:04.350 --> 34:08.154
Oh, okay. You're gonna try to sell
me supplements, knives, face cream?

34:08.187 --> 34:09.155
Breasts.

34:10.054 --> 34:11.658
I'm sorry, what?

34:11.690 --> 34:13.393
I mean do you know
the stats on implants?

34:14.226 --> 34:15.661
Why would I know that?

34:15.695 --> 34:18.398
Okay, a thousand implants are
done every day.

34:18.431 --> 34:20.266
But there's
a problem with them.

34:20.299 --> 34:22.234
Can we fast-forward
to the life-changing part?

34:22.268 --> 34:25.672
If they aren't massaged,
they harden.

34:26.272 --> 34:27.674
You gotta loosen it up.

34:27.706 --> 34:30.409
You gotta... you gotta put space in
between the implant, room to breathe.

34:30.444 --> 34:33.179
Yeah, I... I need to get back to
the office in like twenty minutes.

34:33.212 --> 34:36.650
It's that space that keeps the
breasts feeling soft and natural.

34:36.683 --> 34:38.685
I had no idea. Feels like you're
not listening to me.

34:38.717 --> 34:41.987
Exactly. And you know it's hard
for a woman to rub herself.

34:42.021 --> 34:45.991
She's gotta ask her boyfriend or ask
her husband or ask her girlfriend.

34:46.025 --> 34:47.293
And what if she's single?

34:48.127 --> 34:50.129
I think I'm gonna have
the rock shrimp tempura.

34:50.161 --> 34:51.063
Yup.

34:56.302 --> 34:58.204
Burke Williams, Beyond the Spa.

34:59.138 --> 35:01.307
Do I look like I know anything
about the spa business?

35:04.310 --> 35:07.414
Boob Williams, Beyond the Bra.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.450
So how did it go?

35:10.484 --> 35:14.987
So, it went fine.

35:15.388 --> 35:17.056
- Fine?
- Yeah.

35:18.357 --> 35:19.291
Just fine?

35:19.325 --> 35:21.293
I don't really wanna
talk about it honestly.

35:22.061 --> 35:24.129
Did you write everything out
you're gonna say before...

35:24.163 --> 35:27.801
- I don't really do that anymore.
- Why? Why? It always helped you.

35:27.834 --> 35:30.236
Sorry, I just really don't
want talk about it now.

35:31.170 --> 35:33.105
- You didn't get it?
- I didn't want it.

35:35.074 --> 35:37.276
You know, you say you want
another job

35:37.309 --> 35:39.813
but then you're not open to these
new things that come in your way...

35:39.846 --> 35:43.750
It's a company that massages only
breasts on women with implants.

35:46.419 --> 35:47.587
Okay, okay.

35:47.621 --> 35:50.155
You're gonna turn right here
and we're gonna head south.

35:50.757 --> 35:53.225
Wait, I thought we were doing
this at Taylor and Don's house?

35:53.259 --> 35:54.494
Change of venue.

35:54.528 --> 35:58.798
Come on, push. Push. Push.
Get it up. Get it up. Get it up.

35:58.832 --> 36:00.332
Lock it out!

36:00.366 --> 36:02.268
Good. Rack it.
Take a break.

36:02.802 --> 36:05.405
Thanks again for doing the meeting
here, guys. Where were we?

36:05.438 --> 36:07.774
Yeah, so, uh, religion.

36:07.807 --> 36:10.142
Spiritual, not religious?

36:10.175 --> 36:11.678
- Check.
- Good by me.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.814
- Yeah.
- Yeah. It is so nice that we agree on everything.

36:14.848 --> 36:15.849
Right?

36:15.882 --> 36:18.785
Okay. What do we tell friends,
family, coworkers?

36:18.818 --> 36:23.255
Tell friends, don't tell co-workers.
Family, use discretion.

36:23.289 --> 36:24.691
- Great.
- Yes.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.460
Let's go, leg extensions.
Come on, come on.

36:30.864 --> 36:32.164
Squeeze them out now.

36:32.197 --> 36:34.434
Uh... Parent-teacher nights?

36:34.467 --> 36:36.736
Alternate grades, so teachers
don't catch on.

36:36.770 --> 36:37.737
Sounds great.

36:37.771 --> 36:39.472
Okay. Last name?

36:41.007 --> 36:43.476
I thought we already talked about this.
We're gonna go hyphenated, right?

36:43.510 --> 36:46.680
Let's go. Squat, one last set.
Come on. Burn them out.

36:46.713 --> 36:48.515
Burn them out. Let's go.
Good job. Come on.

36:49.281 --> 36:53.319
Yeah, but I put it back in the list
because we never discussed order.

36:53.352 --> 36:59.291
We assumed that since Don is the biological
father that we'd use his name first.

36:59.325 --> 37:01.494
So, Small-Penaras.

37:01.528 --> 37:05.297
No, no, no, no. Penaras-Small since
Sarah is having the actual baby.

37:05.331 --> 37:07.500
Jeff, kids will tease him
in school.

37:07.534 --> 37:11.671
They'll make up songs,
Penaras-Small, Penaras-Small,

37:11.705 --> 37:14.206
push him on the ground, you
won't even hear him fall.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.176
It happened to me
from first grade on.

37:18.778 --> 37:21.681
Well, no one's singing that song
now. I mean, look at you.

37:21.715 --> 37:24.718
And if it's a dude with the
last name Small-Penaras...

37:26.720 --> 37:28.722
Okay, he's got a point.

37:29.756 --> 37:32.892
Okay. Well, that leaves us
with one last thing,

37:32.926 --> 37:37.229
which is have we talked about
what we're gonna tell the doctor?

37:45.805 --> 37:50.777
That's Jonah, Trevor, Tommy,
Ana, and, yeah, Maggie.

37:51.378 --> 37:52.412
Thanks for asking.

37:52.445 --> 37:53.780
Beautiful family.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.115
It's the best.

37:55.147 --> 37:59.351
It's a big life changer,
but you'll never regret having kids.

37:59.986 --> 38:03.723
Yeah. Speaking of,
can we get back to discussing yours?

38:03.757 --> 38:09.729
Yes. So, Jeff took the test again
but it just said the same thing.

38:09.763 --> 38:12.331
Yeah, it's been hard.
I mean, I just...

38:13.232 --> 38:15.502
I love kids, I love babies.

38:15.535 --> 38:18.838
Well, male infertility is
very difficult to swallow.

38:18.872 --> 38:20.840
But you've
come to the right place.

38:20.874 --> 38:23.242
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.

38:23.275 --> 38:24.978
I'm Don. Don Small.

38:25.011 --> 38:27.414
You look familiar. Have
I seen you somewhere?

38:27.447 --> 38:31.418
Uh, I'm the spokesman for Buff It Out.
You might have seen the ads on YouTube.

38:31.451 --> 38:33.920
Yes. Yes, I have.

38:33.953 --> 38:35.722
Buff It Out. That's you.

38:36.321 --> 38:38.758
Very cool. I'm
bulking up myself, you know,

38:38.792 --> 38:40.827
- trying to get my beach bod on back.
- Cool, cool, good.

38:40.860 --> 38:43.930
Lot of... a lot of shakes.
I don't work out much but...

38:43.963 --> 38:48.435
Dr. Palmer, if you could just go back, you'd
mentioned some technical stuff earlier,

38:48.468 --> 38:52.472
zygotes, intracytoplasmic sperm
injections, ovarian overstimulation.

38:52.505 --> 38:55.442
Can you just go over that
in layman's terms for us?

38:55.475 --> 38:56.409
Great recall.

38:56.443 --> 38:57.877
- Yeah.
- He's a good listener.

38:57.911 --> 39:01.246
Kind of nailed it there. But I'll...
yeah, I'll break it down for you.

39:02.982 --> 39:07.887
You are going to jerk off
in one of our beat bays

39:07.921 --> 39:09.989
and then we're gonna give Sarah
some of these pills,

39:10.023 --> 39:13.393
they're gonna get things charging
for you and then we're just gonna...

39:13.426 --> 39:15.360
We're gonna vacuum out some eggs,

39:15.395 --> 39:18.798
take it all to the laboratory,
that's where we create the baby embryo,

39:18.832 --> 39:21.534
and put it all back up in there
and let it bake for nine months.

39:22.301 --> 39:23.803
- Awesome.
- Okay.

39:24.504 --> 39:25.972
What is the success rate?

39:26.005 --> 39:27.006
Very effective.

39:27.040 --> 39:29.709
Aside from the cost,
there is little downside.

39:29.743 --> 39:32.545
So what's the out of pocket on
something like that, book rate?

39:33.312 --> 39:35.314
For you there's no cost,
you're the donor.

39:35.347 --> 39:37.917
- Of course.
- We're gonna have Sarah and Jeff sign the paperwork

39:37.951 --> 39:42.021
that will legally absolve you from
all responsibility of the child.

39:42.055 --> 39:44.858
So we'd be fully financially
responsible?

39:44.891 --> 39:45.859
Correct.

39:45.892 --> 39:48.728
Yeah, he'll be free and clear
and in exchange

39:48.762 --> 39:51.898
he'll have no claim or
paternity rights to the child.

39:55.969 --> 39:57.336
- Can I get...
- Okay, sure, have one.

39:57.369 --> 40:01.841
Now the procedure is all-inclusive,
flat cost 35.000 per attempt.

40:01.875 --> 40:03.977
Usually doesn't take
more than a couple tries.

40:05.879 --> 40:08.081
Now if you're
looking for a deal, uh,

40:08.114 --> 40:10.450
there's a decent chance
that you'll get a BOGO.

40:11.417 --> 40:13.052
Buy one get one free.

40:13.086 --> 40:14.888
- Twins?
- Precisely.

40:14.921 --> 40:16.856
Yeah, in vitro fertilization

40:16.890 --> 40:19.859
can increase your likelihood of
multiple zygotes by about tenfold.

40:19.893 --> 40:22.462
- I mean that would just defeat the purpose.
- Hmm?

40:22.495 --> 40:25.465
I just want to love that first
baby fully before I have another.

40:25.498 --> 40:30.870
Okay. Well, if you're not looking to increase
your chances of a multiple pregnancy,

40:30.904 --> 40:32.539
then this one's
probably not for you.

40:32.572 --> 40:35.374
Artificial insemination is
another option.

40:35.408 --> 40:38.878
It's not as effective as IVF
but it's much more affordable.

40:38.912 --> 40:42.347
Here at the clinic we charge
about 8000 per attempt.

40:42.382 --> 40:46.386
And a woman of your age probably would
take about six cycles to see a good result.

40:46.419 --> 40:48.988
It just sounds like a scam. I
mean we can do that ourselves.

40:49.022 --> 40:51.724
Ah, the old turkey
baster method.

40:51.758 --> 40:53.126
You're saying
that wouldn't work?

40:53.159 --> 40:56.429
Semen has to be forcefully
inserted into the cervix.

40:56.462 --> 40:57.564
I can squeeze a baster.

40:57.597 --> 41:00.867
You think you could baste
at 28 miles per hour, hmm?

41:00.900 --> 41:03.436
'Cause that's the speed
of ejaculation.

41:03.469 --> 41:07.540
Bottom line is, I've seen many
would-be clients come back to me

41:07.574 --> 41:11.377
after they did the home basting for
years and years with no results.

41:12.145 --> 41:13.947
Yeah, think about it.

41:14.914 --> 41:16.783
It seems
like finances are an issue.

41:18.418 --> 41:19.485
Okay.

41:21.521 --> 41:22.255
Um...

41:23.823 --> 41:25.558
I don't know you guys
very well,

41:26.059 --> 41:29.896
you're very sweet and I don't
want to cross any lines here,

41:29.929 --> 41:35.468
but there's this new alternative,
it's gaining in popularity.

41:36.035 --> 41:38.037
Five times the conception rate.

41:39.906 --> 41:41.474
None of the cost.

41:41.507 --> 41:43.943
Natural donor insemination.

41:43.977 --> 41:45.445
The old-fashioned way.

41:45.979 --> 41:49.883
- So, sex?
- Yes, it's just what it sounds like.

41:49.916 --> 41:52.418
Your husband wouldn't pregnant my
wife, it's out of the question.

41:53.052 --> 41:53.987
What?

41:55.822 --> 41:58.825
It's just... I don't see
any other way around it.

41:58.858 --> 42:01.060
Plus, it solves our legal
and financial problems.

42:01.094 --> 42:03.129
We'd have equal
rights and obligations.

42:03.162 --> 42:05.431
No, no. And of course
you're all in.

42:05.465 --> 42:07.934
- Dude.
- It's kind of the best option we have.

42:08.501 --> 42:09.702
You're for this too?

42:09.736 --> 42:13.773
I'm for a baby. You're the one
that doesn't want a "full" one.

42:15.141 --> 42:17.443
To be fair, I don't either.

42:20.179 --> 42:22.215
We use the ovulation app,

42:22.248 --> 42:23.850
we time it right,

42:24.550 --> 42:25.585
it's one time.

42:29.856 --> 42:31.791
Babe, would you be
okay with that?

42:31.824 --> 42:32.926
Um...

42:32.959 --> 42:35.028
If I have to be okay with this,
she's got to be okay.

42:35.061 --> 42:36.095
Why is that?

42:36.129 --> 42:38.164
Yeah, I don't follow
your logic.

42:38.197 --> 42:42.769
Okay, well, you're the one being
penetrated, he is the penetrator...

42:42.802 --> 42:45.004
Right, and I have
to picture that.

42:45.038 --> 42:48.508
Right. And I'm saying that's less upsetting
to picture than what I have to picture.

42:49.142 --> 42:50.576
How so?

42:50.610 --> 42:53.179
Penetrating something is innately
less violating than being penetrated,

42:53.212 --> 42:56.149
that's by definition.
I mean, right...

42:59.118 --> 43:00.019
I mean,

43:00.820 --> 43:02.221
it's one time,

43:02.255 --> 43:05.124
we're all friends, I'm secure.

43:05.158 --> 43:07.026
Let's play this out.

43:10.830 --> 43:12.098
It would have to be clinical.

43:12.865 --> 43:14.534
Yeah, like a medical procedure.

43:14.567 --> 43:15.902
We'd have ground rules.

43:17.270 --> 43:19.806
Jeff, she's your wife,
I don't want this to be weird afterwards.

43:23.543 --> 43:24.844
Yeah.

43:24.877 --> 43:27.013
Okay, maybe I'm making
too big of a deal about it.

43:27.046 --> 43:28.214
Okay, so one time,

43:29.782 --> 43:31.017
it's for a good cause.

43:31.050 --> 43:32.552
- Yeah.
- Sure.

43:37.924 --> 43:39.826
I feel like we got
to talk about position.

43:41.194 --> 43:42.762
Position?

43:42.795 --> 43:43.963
Yeah. I mean...

43:45.198 --> 43:47.133
It's got to be missionary.

43:47.934 --> 43:49.068
What, are we gonna kiss?

43:50.103 --> 43:54.207
I think it should be spooning,
no eye contact.

43:54.240 --> 43:56.109
It's just procedural, right?

43:57.176 --> 43:58.845
We'd both be relaxed.

43:59.278 --> 44:00.546
Spooning?

44:02.348 --> 44:05.752
No, that's like 90 degrees away
from doggy style, uh-uh.

44:05.785 --> 44:07.086
Well it's my body.

44:07.120 --> 44:08.821
It's whatever she wants.

44:10.323 --> 44:14.794
Fine, Jeff, if you want us
to do missionary, we'll do that.

44:16.295 --> 44:18.031
I have an idea.

44:18.064 --> 44:18.998
I'll monitor it.

44:19.032 --> 44:20.900
I'll be in the room
while it's happening

44:20.933 --> 44:23.202
so no one feels like
anyone's cheating

44:23.236 --> 44:25.905
and I'd feel more comfortable
if I was there anyway

44:25.938 --> 44:28.041
just to know
how it happened.

44:28.074 --> 44:30.243
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

44:30.276 --> 44:31.244
Me too.

44:33.946 --> 44:34.914
Yeah.

44:37.083 --> 44:37.950
Fine.

44:38.351 --> 44:39.552
Okay.

44:40.119 --> 44:42.955
So, location?

44:42.989 --> 44:45.892
We don't want anyone's bedroom
to be tainted.

44:45.925 --> 44:46.893
Hotel.

44:46.926 --> 44:48.027
Yes, hotel room.

44:48.061 --> 44:49.195
I got Starwood points.

44:50.397 --> 44:51.898
Okay.

44:51.931 --> 44:57.003
So hotel room, missionary,
Taylor monitors.

44:58.171 --> 44:59.806
We good with all that?

45:00.339 --> 45:02.909
As good as I'm ever
gonna be on it.

45:03.377 --> 45:04.577
Me too.

45:06.212 --> 45:07.346
Jeff?

45:08.382 --> 45:10.183
Okay, why am I
the only one left out?

45:13.086 --> 45:15.321
Look, if Taylor is there and
you're there and Don's there,

45:15.354 --> 45:17.857
what am I gonna do,
sit in the hallway and twiddle my thumbs?

45:20.159 --> 45:21.594
I feel like I should be there.

45:21.627 --> 45:25.164
- Wait, you want to watch?
- No, I don't want to watch, per se. I just...

45:26.265 --> 45:30.036
Look, I can be in the room
and I can be looking at Taylor

45:30.069 --> 45:31.370
while Taylor's looking at you.

45:35.942 --> 45:40.346
I just feel like if I'm the only
one not there it's gonna be weirder.

45:45.084 --> 45:46.352
- Alright.
- Okay.

45:52.825 --> 45:54.360
Okay.

45:56.863 --> 45:59.098
Alright, stroller, stroller.

45:59.132 --> 46:00.299
Okay.

46:01.334 --> 46:02.635
Stroller High-roller.

46:06.973 --> 46:08.007
<i>I can't do it.</i>

46:08.040 --> 46:08.908
Oh, God.

46:08.941 --> 46:10.776
<i>You can't do it 'cause
you're weak.</i>

46:10.810 --> 46:12.178
<i>Are you lacking games?</i>

46:12.211 --> 46:13.713
<i>Do you want a supplement
made just for men</i>

46:13.746 --> 46:17.183
<i>that has all the nutrients you need
to boost your Hercules hormones</i>

46:17.216 --> 46:19.318
<i>and turn you
into a muscle machine?</i>

46:19.352 --> 46:20.487
<i>You're buff.</i>

46:22.088 --> 46:25.258
<i>Having trouble trying
to tough it out? Buff It Out!</i>

46:29.228 --> 46:31.097
- <i>Hi there. I'm Kimberly Kane.</i>
- Here we go.

46:31.130 --> 46:33.065
<i>Otherwise known
as Stroller High-roller.</i>

46:33.099 --> 46:36.969
<i>Now today we are gonna look at
bargain strollers in the 1500...</i>

46:37.003 --> 46:38.271
- I like that.
- <i>...to 2000 dollars.</i>

46:38.304 --> 46:39.672
- If you know.
- Damn.

46:39.705 --> 46:43.075
- Yeah.
- If you're not on your hands and knees getting dirty,

46:43.109 --> 46:44.343
you're not on vacation.

46:44.378 --> 46:46.913
I love that.

46:46.946 --> 46:48.482
I love that. I love that.

46:48.515 --> 46:51.884
Listen, man, I got to tell you, I'm just
so excited to get this new teammate.

46:51.918 --> 46:54.153
We've been thinking about all
the good that we've been doing...

46:57.890 --> 47:02.128
- Fully impressing, man.
- Oh, man. You're legendary, seriously. Yeah.

47:02.161 --> 47:03.796
Well, thanks.

47:03.829 --> 47:05.097
Jeff, get over here.

47:06.866 --> 47:08.267
Hey everyone.

47:08.301 --> 47:11.904
Zeke, you remember Jeff Penaras?
He's our chief executive of new orders.

47:11.938 --> 47:12.939
Nope.

47:12.972 --> 47:14.774
That's cool. Nice to meet you.

47:14.807 --> 47:18.277
Keep those new orders rolling in and I'll keep
supply coming to you, you know what I mean?

47:18.311 --> 47:19.812
Yeah, sounds good, yeah.

47:19.845 --> 47:22.815
Hopefully one day I can join you out
there, get some sun, see the fields.

47:22.848 --> 47:24.418
You might need to change
for that though.

47:24.451 --> 47:26.052
Of course. Yeah.

47:26.085 --> 47:29.355
I'll teach you about, you know, the ins
and outs of irrigation and soil sampling.

47:29.389 --> 47:31.924
- How about that?
- Okay. Great.

47:32.992 --> 47:37.029
Well, look, I wanted you to at least re-meet
the man of your dreams while he's here.

47:37.063 --> 47:39.031
- Oh, thank you.
- How's that?

47:39.065 --> 47:42.335
Jeff actually told me that he
wanted to start working here

47:42.368 --> 47:44.337
after he saw the photo of you
in the brochure.

47:44.370 --> 47:46.072
- It's...
- Is that true, Jeff?

47:46.105 --> 47:49.208
I mean you just looked so happy
out there in the fields, um...

47:49.242 --> 47:51.411
It was a great selling point.
So, thank you for that.

47:51.445 --> 47:56.215
Anyway, probably you should get back to your
desk, you probably have a lot of stuff.

47:56.249 --> 48:00.152
Yeah, yeah I got... I got to go.
Lot of new orders. It's nice to meet you.

48:00.987 --> 48:03.823
- Nice to re-meet you.
- He's a good guy.

48:23.377 --> 48:26.979
It sounds like you're having some
apprehension about this plan.

48:27.013 --> 48:30.016
You like the end
but not the means.

48:33.252 --> 48:37.123
Events themselves have only
the meaning we assign them.

48:37.890 --> 48:43.229
So if, let's say, a man put his finger
in your ass and fondled your balls,

48:43.996 --> 48:45.364
I mean you
could see that as a weird thing.

48:46.966 --> 48:51.837
But if that man was your doctor giving
you a testicular and prostate checkup,

48:51.871 --> 48:53.172
it would be totally normal.

48:53.906 --> 48:56.008
You have just
framed it differently.

48:56.342 --> 49:00.079
Now, I want you to try to reframe
your thoughts about what would happen.

49:00.112 --> 49:04.216
Well, how I do even start?
I just keep picturing them thrusting.

49:04.250 --> 49:05.885
Yeah, okay, but think
about the end.

49:05.918 --> 49:08.087
- And then more thrusting.
- Right, I got it.

49:08.120 --> 49:10.956
- And then she's looking at him thrusting.
- Uh, okay.

49:10.990 --> 49:13.225
- He's looking at her thrusting.
- Very specific imagery.

49:13.259 --> 49:15.895
- It's a lot of thrusting.
- Okay, but think about the end.

49:16.295 --> 49:17.397
What's the end?

49:18.898 --> 49:19.965
A compromise.

49:23.269 --> 49:24.370
Sarah's happy.

49:25.137 --> 49:26.272
I'm happy.

49:27.907 --> 49:29.241
And we have a life we enjoy.

49:29.275 --> 49:32.278
Okay, good, good.

49:32.311 --> 49:34.113
I want you
to close your eyes.

49:35.081 --> 49:36.015
Go ahead.

49:36.949 --> 49:37.883
Close them.

49:39.386 --> 49:42.288
I want you to picture,
just the gut,

49:43.155 --> 49:45.024
what a day would be like,

49:45.459 --> 49:49.195
a week, a month,
a couple of years.

51:25.024 --> 51:26.393
You're such a good kid.

51:26.426 --> 51:29.295
- We love you so much.
- Yeah. Good night.

51:29.328 --> 51:30.497
Good night.

51:34.300 --> 51:36.135
- Night, buddy.
- Night.

51:41.040 --> 51:43.108
I am having such a great time.

51:43.142 --> 51:46.345
Yeah, me too. It's nice having
so much free time.

51:47.213 --> 51:48.280
Time.

51:49.248 --> 51:50.417
Time.

51:50.450 --> 51:52.117
Time.

51:52.151 --> 51:53.319
Time, Jeff.

51:53.352 --> 51:55.187
We've reached
the end of our time.

51:55.221 --> 51:57.791
- Can we pick up there next week?
- Yeah.

51:57.824 --> 51:58.991
Okay, great.

52:25.685 --> 52:27.754
Hey, you okay?

52:29.288 --> 52:30.757
Yeah, it's just nerves.

52:34.861 --> 52:38.130
If you're having second thoughts, you
know, we could still change our minds.

52:38.498 --> 52:42.167
No, we thought this through.
It all makes logical sense.

52:42.201 --> 52:43.269
I mean...

52:44.938 --> 52:47.172
I had second thoughts before our wedding
and then it all turned out fine, right?

52:50.410 --> 52:51.711
So far.

53:04.123 --> 53:05.324
Okay, so...

53:09.896 --> 53:11.398
Looking at them.

53:12.832 --> 53:14.066
That will work.

53:22.174 --> 53:23.677
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:23.710 --> 53:24.844
I'm...

53:26.211 --> 53:27.179
Yeah.

53:29.716 --> 53:32.719
I'm just gonna get
some breath mints.

53:39.793 --> 53:41.360
You're not gonna wear a shirt?

53:41.394 --> 53:43.362
I don't want to sweat on her.

53:43.897 --> 53:45.097
Mm.

53:52.271 --> 53:53.840
Baby, I love you.

54:00.245 --> 54:01.815
He's got a lot of muscles.

54:01.848 --> 54:03.182
Yeah.

54:06.185 --> 54:07.219
They're sugar-free.

54:09.823 --> 54:11.190
So I just...

54:11.825 --> 54:13.526
- I just think before we...
- I...

54:14.961 --> 54:18.163
I think we should just dive right
in, skip any awkward conversation

54:18.197 --> 54:20.299
and just get down
to business.

54:20.332 --> 54:22.267
- We agree.
- Full steam ahead.

54:24.804 --> 54:28.173
- Okay.
- Can you just do... do it under here?

54:28.207 --> 54:30.309
- Oh, yeah, yeah, of course... Of course.
- Yeah.

54:36.850 --> 54:41.454
- Okay. Let me just put my leg here.
- Yeah, yeah, get it.

54:41.488 --> 54:43.723
Okay. Ooh, ooh, my...-

54:44.356 --> 54:46.325
- Alright.
- Okay.

54:46.358 --> 54:47.761
Okay.

54:48.728 --> 54:49.729
Okay.

54:49.763 --> 54:51.798
- I'm gonna just go...
- Yep.

54:54.299 --> 54:55.769
Did they start?

54:56.936 --> 54:57.937
No.

55:01.007 --> 55:02.909
I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

55:02.942 --> 55:08.381
Hey... hey guys, I'm... I'm feeling...
I'm just... I'm feeling nervous.

55:14.521 --> 55:17.457
Whoa, whoa. We didn't talk about
performance-enhancing drugs.

55:17.490 --> 55:20.460
Well, it's either this or my husband
in between your wife's legs for longer.

55:22.462 --> 55:23.830
Thanks, babe.

55:26.298 --> 55:27.867
I got these from a friend.

55:27.901 --> 55:30.403
- Oh, it's not yours?
- No, no, no, no, I just...

55:31.004 --> 55:32.271
Sure.

55:35.408 --> 55:36.409
Okay.

55:38.478 --> 55:40.345
- Let me... I'm just gonna get off...
- Yeah.

55:40.380 --> 55:42.247
- It's probably gonna take a minute.
- Mm-hm.

55:42.281 --> 55:44.984
Okay. We're just gonna take
a breather now, guys.

55:45.018 --> 55:46.553
- Alright.
- Okay.

56:07.741 --> 56:08.775
I'm ready.

56:09.909 --> 56:10.977
- You? Yeah?
- Yeah.

56:11.010 --> 56:12.378
Alright.

56:13.012 --> 56:13.980
He's ready.

56:15.482 --> 56:16.483
Great.

56:18.852 --> 56:20.553
- Okay.
- Alright.

56:21.488 --> 56:23.322
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:23.355 --> 56:24.289
- Alright.
- Okay.

56:24.323 --> 56:25.391
I'm gonna go for it.

56:26.493 --> 56:28.360
- Uh, wait.
- What... what's the matter? What's matter?

56:28.928 --> 56:33.298
I'm really nervous too. I...
I think I need some help.

56:33.332 --> 56:35.068
- What are they doing?
- Just talking.

56:35.101 --> 56:36.870
- Jeff.
- Yeah?

56:36.903 --> 56:38.772
Can you get the thing
in my purse?

56:39.338 --> 56:40.807
What thing?

56:40.840 --> 56:42.742
There's a bottle
in the front pocket.

56:47.380 --> 56:49.348
Okay, I didn't know you're gonna
bring this but...

56:50.116 --> 56:51.885
I'm not going
in there. Please.

56:51.918 --> 56:52.886
Please.

56:53.853 --> 56:54.988
Alright, I think it's
expired but...

56:55.021 --> 56:57.490
- These things don't expire.
- Thanks, babe.

56:58.525 --> 56:59.859
- Oh, just there.
- Yeah.

56:59.893 --> 57:01.461
- You want...
- Yeah, no, I'll do it.

57:01.494 --> 57:02.629
- Okay.
- Turn around.

57:02.662 --> 57:04.764
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course,
of course, I'm not looking.

57:08.802 --> 57:11.104
Ah, it's too much.

57:11.137 --> 57:12.505
- Oh.
- Ah...

57:15.508 --> 57:17.510
- Can I...
- Yeah, just wipe it off.

57:17.544 --> 57:18.745
Yeah.

57:18.778 --> 57:20.914
- Are you good?
- Oh, crap. Yeah.

57:20.947 --> 57:22.382
Okay, good to go.

57:22.415 --> 57:23.149
Great.

57:25.552 --> 57:27.921
- I'm just gonna go for it.
- Mh-hm.

57:27.954 --> 57:29.422
Whoa!

57:30.790 --> 57:32.959
- Whoa? What does that mean?
- Shhh.

57:35.028 --> 57:36.529
She said "Whoa."

57:41.835 --> 57:43.169
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

57:43.203 --> 57:47.440
- Okay. Okay. You just... you let... you tell me if...
- Totally fine.

57:48.174 --> 57:51.477
- This is kind of weird looking at you like this.
- It's weird. This is weird.

57:51.511 --> 57:53.479
Just your right,
my left, okay.

57:53.513 --> 57:56.449
- I'm on the left, my right. We'll turn this way.
- Um, I'll turn this way.

57:56.482 --> 57:58.117
- You turn that way, okay.
- Yeah, okay, cool.

57:58.151 --> 58:00.119
Are you good? Okay.

58:00.153 --> 58:02.088
- I slept really weird, can we change?
- Switch it?

58:02.121 --> 58:04.023
- Yeah. Switch my neck.
- Cool. Okay.

58:04.057 --> 58:04.991
Hear a creak in my neck.

58:06.159 --> 58:07.126
Oh, yeah.

58:08.228 --> 58:10.129
So let me know if it's...
if it gets uncomfortable,

58:10.163 --> 58:11.397
- if there's...
- I'm fine.

58:11.431 --> 58:13.132
- Okay.
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just...

58:21.808 --> 58:23.042
Are they almost done?

58:25.078 --> 58:25.979
No.

58:28.915 --> 58:30.783
Fourteen dollars
for gummy worms.

58:34.921 --> 58:36.756
Oh, mirror, mirror.

58:36.789 --> 58:37.891
Bad angle.
We should have checked it.

58:37.924 --> 58:40.126
Taylor is gonna come in there
and cover it up, okay?

58:40.159 --> 58:41.461
Oh, he can see us.

58:41.494 --> 58:43.730
- Oh, okay, I'm gonna...
- Yeah, pause it.

58:43.763 --> 58:44.697
Yeah, we're stopping.

58:44.731 --> 58:47.934
Okay, coming in
with the towel. One second.

58:49.969 --> 58:52.105
- Okay.
- Thanks, babe.

58:52.138 --> 58:53.139
Let me see.

58:53.172 --> 58:54.774
- Is that better?
- That's better.

58:54.807 --> 58:56.776
- Okay, resume.
- Okay.

58:58.077 --> 59:00.580
Okay, okay.

59:17.563 --> 59:19.933
I think... I think I can do it.

59:20.900 --> 59:22.502
- Hey.
- Yeah?

59:22.535 --> 59:26.472
Can I go a little harder? I just need
to go a little harder and it would help.

59:26.506 --> 59:28.107
- Yeah, just go harder.
- Okay.

59:28.141 --> 59:32.145
Hey... hey Jeff, can I go
a little harder, bud?

59:32.178 --> 59:33.179
What?

59:33.212 --> 59:34.914
Harder. Can I go harder?

59:34.948 --> 59:36.783
You're gonna have to ask Sarah.

59:36.816 --> 59:38.017
Yeah, I'm fine with it.

59:39.185 --> 59:40.987
I'm good with it too then.

59:42.121 --> 59:44.857
It's fine, it's... it's still
pretty clinical, Jeff.

59:45.525 --> 59:46.459
Yeah.

59:48.094 --> 59:49.162
You can go harder.

59:54.067 --> 59:56.936
- Are you almost...
- Yeah. Shh. Just...

59:56.970 --> 59:58.171
Sorry.

01:00:12.318 --> 01:00:14.153
- Gummy worms?
- No.

01:00:17.056 --> 01:00:18.057
Fuck.

01:00:20.893 --> 01:00:21.794
Heads up.

01:00:41.881 --> 01:00:44.250
Guys, my arms are
getting tired.

01:00:44.283 --> 01:00:46.152
His arms are getting tired?

01:00:48.021 --> 01:00:49.522
He wants her to go on top.

01:00:51.224 --> 01:00:55.028
Babe, can't we just do it, guys? It'll be
much quicker if we can just switch positions.

01:00:55.061 --> 01:00:57.163
Maybe you should've done
a couple more push-ups.

01:00:59.165 --> 01:01:01.534
Alright, just go ahead.

01:01:02.068 --> 01:01:04.070
Oh, oh, God.

01:01:05.004 --> 01:01:06.606
Oh, God.

01:01:07.874 --> 01:01:09.575
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:01:09.609 --> 01:01:10.543
Okay.

01:01:11.344 --> 01:01:12.879
Alright.

01:01:12.912 --> 01:01:15.915
Is this okay? This is
how you like it, right?

01:01:22.622 --> 01:01:23.589
Ugh.

01:01:24.857 --> 01:01:26.059
Fuck.

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:37.236
Guys, guys, I'm sorry it's...
it's not working. It's just not working.

01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:39.906
God damn it. You never have
this much stamina with me.

01:01:39.939 --> 01:01:43.276
Just I'm... I'm under a lot of
pressure right now, okay? I just...

01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:44.877
I mean you always
come quick when...

01:01:45.211 --> 01:01:47.847
Come quick when what?
When what?

01:01:48.382 --> 01:01:50.183
- From behind.
- No, he does not.

01:01:50.216 --> 01:01:52.018
- Yeah. Yup.
- No, he does not do that.

01:01:52.051 --> 01:01:53.920
It's the only
way he finishes.

01:01:53.953 --> 01:01:55.254
Can we just get this over with?

01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:59.058
- Well then.
- Okay.

01:01:59.092 --> 01:02:01.027
- Oh, God.
- It'll help, Jeff.

01:02:15.808 --> 01:02:19.345
I just want you to remember
this was your idea.

01:02:21.214 --> 01:02:22.982
This was the both of us.

01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:25.985
Fine, I came up with it.

01:02:27.854 --> 01:02:29.122
It was a terrible idea.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.129
Still fairly clinical, Jeff.

01:02:38.364 --> 01:02:41.934
Guys, I... I need
her to talk dirty.

01:02:41.968 --> 01:02:43.202
Absolutely not.

01:02:43.236 --> 01:02:44.937
You want me to finish, right?

01:02:44.971 --> 01:02:45.938
Let's do this.

01:02:45.972 --> 01:02:47.907
We got to do what's best
for the baby, Jeff.

01:02:50.176 --> 01:02:51.911
- Ooh.
- Oh, yeah.

01:02:51.944 --> 01:02:52.879
Yeah, do it.

01:02:54.347 --> 01:02:55.948
Oh, that feels so good.

01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:59.118
Mm-hm.
Is this... is this working?

01:02:59.152 --> 01:03:01.921
- Coach her, babe.
- Taylor, I need some help.

01:03:03.222 --> 01:03:06.058
Call him... oh, God...

01:03:06.092 --> 01:03:08.928
- Walk her through it, Taylor.
- I don't know what to say.

01:03:08.961 --> 01:03:11.230
Just tell him
his forearms are tiny.

01:03:11.264 --> 01:03:12.965
Your forearms are tiny.

01:03:12.999 --> 01:03:14.401
Like a... like a little T-Rex.

01:03:14.434 --> 01:03:17.136
- What?
- Say exactly what I just said.

01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:18.938
You're like a little T-Rex.

01:03:18.971 --> 01:03:20.806
You have to mean it.
You have to mean it.

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.975
You're at baby T-Rex.
You have no forearms.

01:03:23.009 --> 01:03:25.412
I'm a little T-Rex baby, yeah.

01:03:25.445 --> 01:03:27.246
Who's my little dinosaur?

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.149
- I'm your little dinosaur.
- Who's my little dinosaur?

01:03:30.183 --> 01:03:33.920
- You're a little baby dinosaur.
- Baby dinosaur.

01:03:33.953 --> 01:03:36.889
- Yeah, got baby arms.
- You got little baby arms.

01:03:36.923 --> 01:03:39.158
You're little, you're Don Small.

01:03:39.192 --> 01:03:42.396
- Sing it. "Playground."
- How does the song go? What's the song, Taylor?

01:03:42.429 --> 01:03:43.829
Fuck.

01:03:43.863 --> 01:03:46.832
- I'm not gonna be able to unhear this.
- <i>♪ Don is small ♪</i>

01:03:47.233 --> 01:03:51.971
Don...
<i>♪ Don is small Don is small ♪</i>

01:03:52.371 --> 01:03:54.807
- <i>♪ Push him on the ground ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Push him on the ground ♪</i>

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:57.877
- <i>♪ Won't even hear him fall ♪</i>
- <i>♪ Won't even hear him fall ♪</i>

01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:59.011
Lot of syllables.

01:03:59.045 --> 01:04:01.247
- <i>♪ Don is small ♪</i>
- Small.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.115
- <i>♪ Don is small ♪</i>
- Oh yeah.

01:04:03.149 --> 01:04:04.884
<i>♪ Push him on the ground ♪</i>

01:04:05.385 --> 01:04:07.887
- Is it too late to stop?
- Can't stop now.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.889
- <i>♪ Don is small ♪</i>
- Oh, God.

01:04:09.922 --> 01:04:12.325
- <i>♪ Push him on the ground ♪</i>
- Oh, no. No. No.

01:04:12.358 --> 01:04:14.227
Please make him stop.
Please make him stop.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.362
No, no, no, no, no. No!

01:04:18.965 --> 01:04:22.134
Hmm, I can tell it's still
very painful for you.

01:04:23.836 --> 01:04:24.937
It's not getting any better.

01:04:24.971 --> 01:04:27.206
Well, it's only been
a couple of weeks.

01:04:28.408 --> 01:04:32.311
What I want you to do is ask yourself
what it is that you're actually feeling.

01:04:32.345 --> 01:04:36.349
Anger? Jealousy? Inferiority?

01:04:36.383 --> 01:04:37.817
Yeah.

01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:38.918
All of those?

01:04:38.951 --> 01:04:42.121
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, okay, that's a lot.

01:04:42.154 --> 01:04:45.358
I've been having these thoughts
lately about getting even.

01:04:45.392 --> 01:04:48.428
Revenge is a natural impulse
when we feel hurt.

01:04:48.462 --> 01:04:49.396
It's...

01:04:50.863 --> 01:04:52.131
It's so dumb I just...

01:04:53.199 --> 01:04:54.601
Look, I know
I asked for this, right?

01:04:54.635 --> 01:04:57.236
But what do you think? I mean do you
think this was just a stupid idea?

01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:02.074
Well, what I'm hearing is that
you thought it was a good one.

01:05:02.108 --> 01:05:03.943
Please tell me
your professional opinion.

01:05:03.976 --> 01:05:05.978
- I want to go back to our exercise.
- Can you tell me?

01:05:06.012 --> 01:05:08.981
- I want to go back to our exercise.
- Can you just say yes or no?

01:05:09.015 --> 01:05:10.450
- And you... Okay.
- Bad? Good.

01:05:10.484 --> 01:05:15.354
I get what you want me to say,
but I want to go back to our exercise,

01:05:15.389 --> 01:05:17.957
the one where you work
on reframing.

01:05:18.357 --> 01:05:19.992
Have you been trying it?

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:21.827
No.

01:05:21.861 --> 01:05:22.962
You haven't?

01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:25.031
That was your homework, Jeff.

01:05:25.432 --> 01:05:27.266
Okay. Well, let's continue.

01:05:32.673 --> 01:05:35.841
He's sitting here in dirty diapers.
Why I'm always taking care of you?

01:05:35.875 --> 01:05:38.110
This is... why did... what?

01:05:38.144 --> 01:05:40.414
I told you...

01:05:40.447 --> 01:05:42.048
Who is holding
the baby right now?

01:05:42.081 --> 01:05:45.284
- That was so long ago and she was standing there.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:05:45.318 --> 01:05:47.353
- Shhh.
- I did try to...

01:05:47.387 --> 01:05:49.623
You're 45 minutes
late. We're a bit...

01:05:49.656 --> 01:05:51.324
So we're a little
late. I'm gonna take...

01:05:51.357 --> 01:05:53.926
Hey, whoa, whoa. There's
a baby in here.

01:05:55.127 --> 01:05:56.862
Oh!

01:05:56.896 --> 01:05:58.864
Hey, what are you doing?

01:06:02.669 --> 01:06:04.003
Sarah!

01:06:05.171 --> 01:06:06.372
Hey, you going out?

01:06:06.406 --> 01:06:08.274
I hate you!

01:06:17.049 --> 01:06:18.351
Alright.

01:06:18.385 --> 01:06:19.985
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:06:20.019 --> 01:06:21.253
Be safe.

01:06:24.658 --> 01:06:26.058
Shh.

01:06:26.693 --> 01:06:27.427
Hey.

01:06:38.672 --> 01:06:39.673
What?

01:06:39.706 --> 01:06:41.273
What are you doing in here?

01:06:43.042 --> 01:06:46.278
Should I split it?
And I don't even know whose it is.

01:07:12.972 --> 01:07:14.073
Daddy.

01:07:16.275 --> 01:07:19.979
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:07:20.012 --> 01:07:20.980
Stop.

01:07:22.682 --> 01:07:25.017
We're gonna have
to stop there, Jeff.

01:07:25.419 --> 01:07:29.423
Felix, Ace, Guy, Nathan,
Rong, Ron.

01:07:29.456 --> 01:07:33.058
Ron? No, no, no, that's like he's coming
out of the womb with a law degree.

01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:35.261
Casper, Jock, Frank,
Craig. Craig?

01:07:35.294 --> 01:07:36.262
- No.
- No.

01:07:36.295 --> 01:07:37.597
That... that's your ex's name.

01:07:37.631 --> 01:07:41.300
Okay. Well, if we're gonna follow
that rule, then no Lindsleys.

01:07:41.333 --> 01:07:43.169
We were never exclusive.

01:07:43.202 --> 01:07:46.972
Okay guys, maybe we'd just table the conversation
until we find out if she's actually pregnant.

01:07:47.006 --> 01:07:49.676
Well, we have time now, why don't
we just nail down a couple for each?

01:07:49.709 --> 01:07:52.646
But we're on the eighteen
hundredth most popular baby name

01:07:52.679 --> 01:07:54.448
and we've agreed on exactly
none of them.

01:07:54.481 --> 01:07:57.384
Do I have a Small-Penaras?

01:07:57.417 --> 01:08:00.052
It's actually Penaras-Small.

01:08:00.085 --> 01:08:01.320
Okay, you the biological father?

01:08:01.353 --> 01:08:03.355
No, but... but we're
all the parents.

01:08:03.390 --> 01:08:05.090
Okay.

01:08:05.124 --> 01:08:09.429
Well, this is the genetic screening, so I'm
just gonna need the ones that, you know.

01:08:09.463 --> 01:08:11.030
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:08:11.063 --> 01:08:12.164
- Cool.
- Yeah.

01:08:13.433 --> 01:08:15.334
Alright, have fun.

01:08:19.473 --> 01:08:22.107
Should we keep going
through names?

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:24.176
Yeah. I mean it's
only fair, right?

01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:25.144
Yeah.

01:08:25.176 --> 01:08:26.680
Let's filter it by boy names.

01:08:27.814 --> 01:08:31.250
River, Caleb, Harper, Tucker,
Caden. I like Caden.

01:08:31.283 --> 01:08:34.185
Caden sounds like he's
in a baby fraternity.

01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:37.223
Alright. Jason, Stanley,
Harold, Scott.

01:08:37.256 --> 01:08:40.326
- Scott.
- Come on, that's so boring, just like one syllable.

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:41.359
Scott.

01:08:41.394 --> 01:08:44.263
Scott. Scott.

01:08:45.064 --> 01:08:49.402
Okay, when you'd say it like that.
Most people would just say Scott.

01:08:49.435 --> 01:08:53.072
August, Kyle, Brennan, Kaden,
different spelling, Zach, Mitch.

01:08:53.104 --> 01:08:54.372
Zach. How about Zach?

01:08:54.407 --> 01:08:56.676
Zach. Zach.

01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:58.143
You're doing the same thing.

01:08:59.144 --> 01:09:01.180
- Well, should we switch to girls?
- Yeah, fine.

01:09:03.249 --> 01:09:07.787
You know, to be honest, the only
name I've ever really liked is Neha.

01:09:07.821 --> 01:09:09.389
- It was my grandma's name.
- I like that.

01:09:10.089 --> 01:09:11.691
- Should I add it to the list?
- Yeah.

01:09:13.225 --> 01:09:17.731
Alright. There's also Sloan, Mason,
and Candice, Fiona. Fiona, I like that.

01:09:17.764 --> 01:09:19.799
Yeah. I actually love that.

01:09:19.832 --> 01:09:23.068
God, this is so much easier
with two people. Alright.

01:09:23.703 --> 01:09:25.037
Hey.

01:09:26.406 --> 01:09:28.173
Do you think we should talk
about what happened in the hotel?

01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:32.712
Hey, we got it.

01:09:34.747 --> 01:09:36.282
- Fiona.
- No.

01:09:36.314 --> 01:09:37.751
- No. Terrible.
- No, no.

01:09:41.287 --> 01:09:42.187
Hey.

01:09:44.858 --> 01:09:47.426
- Did I miss the parking lot?
- A little bit.

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.095
If I had known we're meeting on
site, I wouldn't have worn a suit.

01:09:52.331 --> 01:09:55.267
You remember that deal memo I
had you sign ten years ago?

01:09:55.869 --> 01:09:58.471
Vaguely. I think I remember
reading about salary benefits.

01:09:58.505 --> 01:10:02.341
Section B2A, it's all about
electronic communications

01:10:02.374 --> 01:10:05.244
and we flag any time somebody
sends out a resume.

01:10:05.277 --> 01:10:09.281
Like Jeff resume dot PDF.

01:10:11.317 --> 01:10:13.152
You want to leave us, Jeff?

01:10:13.185 --> 01:10:14.454
No, no.

01:10:15.855 --> 01:10:17.023
Okay, here's the thing.

01:10:17.057 --> 01:10:20.292
An old buddy of mine said he had
a great opportunity for me

01:10:20.794 --> 01:10:24.497
so I met with him but it
turned out to not be that.

01:10:24.531 --> 01:10:27.400
- Alright, you said you wanted to be outdoors, right?
- I do. I do, yeah.

01:10:27.434 --> 01:10:31.136
Well, what if this was
your new office?

01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:37.410
Yeah, like all of this.

01:10:37.444 --> 01:10:39.144
Four days a week.

01:10:40.947 --> 01:10:42.281
What do you think?

01:10:42.314 --> 01:10:43.282
Yeah.

01:10:59.966 --> 01:11:01.233
Sarah?

01:11:02.234 --> 01:11:03.335
Hey, you upstairs?

01:11:04.738 --> 01:11:06.271
I have some good news.

01:11:07.774 --> 01:11:10.242
Hey, Sarah. Sarah.

01:11:10.275 --> 01:11:11.444
Sarah?

01:11:13.212 --> 01:11:14.179
Hello.

01:11:19.386 --> 01:11:21.353
Is it...

01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:25.525
Wait, already? That was fast.

01:11:26.291 --> 01:11:27.226
Wait.

01:11:28.728 --> 01:11:29.729
I'm gonna be a dad.

01:11:29.763 --> 01:11:31.296
Well, you are gonna
be a parent.

01:11:31.330 --> 01:11:32.432
Right.

01:11:33.232 --> 01:11:34.768
I'm gonna be a parent.

01:11:36.736 --> 01:11:37.971
With you.

01:11:38.004 --> 01:11:39.973
- We're gonna be parents.
- We're gonna be parents.

01:11:40.006 --> 01:11:43.242
- We're gonna be parents. We're gonna be parents.
- Yeah.

01:11:44.243 --> 01:11:45.310
Oh my God.

01:11:46.479 --> 01:11:49.281
- You're gonna be a mom. You're gonna be a mom.
- Yeah.

01:11:49.314 --> 01:11:51.484
I'm gonna be a dad. Okay.
We got... we got to call them.

01:11:51.518 --> 01:11:53.820
Can we wait till tomorrow
to tell them?

01:11:53.853 --> 01:11:55.922
Let's just spend the night,
pretend like it's ours.

01:11:58.858 --> 01:12:00.292
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:12:08.902 --> 01:12:11.805
- <i>We got to talk about position.</i>
- <i>Position?</i>

01:12:11.838 --> 01:12:13.205
<i>It's got to be
missionary.</i>

01:12:13.238 --> 01:12:17.944
<i>Fine, Jeff, if you want us
to do missionary, we'll do that.</i>

01:12:26.285 --> 01:12:27.954
<i>Come on.</i>

01:12:45.839 --> 01:12:47.006
Aahhh!

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.715
- Okay, okay.
- Sorry.

01:12:55.749 --> 01:12:59.018
It's fine, it's fine.
It's all good. It's cool.

01:13:00.754 --> 01:13:02.287
At least we don't have
to do it again.

01:13:02.321 --> 01:13:03.823
Guys, a toast.

01:13:04.424 --> 01:13:07.393
Here's to two couples, one baby
and no regrets.

01:13:07.427 --> 01:13:08.528
Cheers!

01:13:08.561 --> 01:13:10.329
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:14:23.069 --> 01:14:24.938
Argh, not again.

01:14:26.172 --> 01:14:29.542
Why don't you go
find a man and get a life?

01:14:30.443 --> 01:14:32.445
I'm pregnant.

01:14:55.001 --> 01:14:56.069
We'd like to split it.

01:14:57.437 --> 01:14:58.538
No, with them.

01:14:59.906 --> 01:15:00.840
Okay.

01:15:23.096 --> 01:15:24.063
Hey.

01:15:25.531 --> 01:15:26.499
Hey guys.

01:15:26.532 --> 01:15:27.800
- Hi.
- You okay?

01:15:27.834 --> 01:15:30.003
- How are you doing?
- It's moving a little slow today.

01:15:30.036 --> 01:15:31.471
- You okay? Careful.
- Yeah.

01:15:31.504 --> 01:15:33.006
How's my little baby?

01:15:34.874 --> 01:15:36.009
Alright, come on in.

01:15:36.542 --> 01:15:38.044
Just watch your head.

01:15:38.077 --> 01:15:40.880
Yeah, no, just like... I tweaked my
back in the gym, so just give me a sec.

01:15:40.914 --> 01:15:42.782
- Yeah.
- You seriously can't push this more?

01:15:42.815 --> 01:15:45.118
That's... I think... this is
as far... as far as it goes.

01:15:45.151 --> 01:15:47.954
That's as far as it goes.
Sorry, bud. I know.

01:15:47.987 --> 01:15:49.889
Just watch my neck.
Watch my neck.

01:15:49.923 --> 01:15:51.024
- You good? Hey, Taylor.
- Yeah.

01:15:51.057 --> 01:15:53.159
- Hi.
- If you can push your seat up, that'd be good.

01:15:53.192 --> 01:15:54.093
Yeah.

01:15:54.127 --> 01:15:56.562
- Yeah, just a little more.
- Alright.

01:15:56.596 --> 01:15:57.864
That's good.

01:15:57.897 --> 01:15:58.998
- Okay.
- Can you keep it there?

01:15:59.032 --> 01:16:01.200
- It's a little intense there for me.
- Okay.

01:16:01.234 --> 01:16:03.503
Little... little much.

01:16:03.536 --> 01:16:05.905
- If I come this way...
- How is that? Is that okay?

01:16:05.939 --> 01:16:07.006
Okay, alright.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.174
We all set?

01:16:11.044 --> 01:16:13.746
Okay, it's... it's normally not
gonna be all of us, so.

01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:16.182
Maybe consider getting a new car
though for when the kid comes.

01:16:17.550 --> 01:16:18.985
I'm not getting a new car.

01:16:19.018 --> 01:16:22.855
All that has to fit back there is
one baby seat and a diaper bag, so.

01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:31.731
Alright.

01:16:31.764 --> 01:16:33.533
- How does that feel?
- Ooh. That was fast.

01:16:34.968 --> 01:16:36.536
Alright.

01:16:38.104 --> 01:16:42.842
Well, looks like I got a bit
of new information for you.

01:16:42.875 --> 01:16:43.810
You know the sex?

01:16:43.843 --> 01:16:45.111
It's a girl, isn't it?

01:16:45.144 --> 01:16:47.213
I just have this gut
feeling it's a girl.

01:16:47.246 --> 01:16:52.085
- I'm thinking it's a boy.
- He wants a boy in a proud donor kind of way.

01:16:52.952 --> 01:16:54.754
Just tell us.
Is it a boy or a girl?

01:16:54.787 --> 01:16:56.889
Well, it's too early
to tell the sex.

01:16:56.923 --> 01:17:00.093
But if you look closely,
it's a little heartbeat.

01:17:01.594 --> 01:17:02.895
Right there.

01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:08.101
And if you go back a little
further, there's a second one.

01:17:09.235 --> 01:17:10.603
It's twins.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.842
Twins. Twins are the best.

01:17:18.311 --> 01:17:22.048
Wait, that can't be right. You said
twins were likely if we did in vitro.

01:17:22.081 --> 01:17:25.051
Uh, more likely, yes.

01:17:25.084 --> 01:17:27.053
But I didn't say impossible.

01:17:27.086 --> 01:17:30.023
This just happened naturally.

01:17:30.056 --> 01:17:32.859
- God's will.
- Okay, don't bring God into this, no.

01:17:38.064 --> 01:17:42.168
I can't believe this. From... from out of
nowhere two future humans in my wife's stomach.

01:17:42.201 --> 01:17:43.136
Uterus.

01:17:43.169 --> 01:17:45.171
One percent chance
and it happens to us.

01:17:45.204 --> 01:17:47.306
It's actually closer
to three percent.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:52.045
I'm sorry,
did you say us as in...

01:17:52.078 --> 01:17:55.248
Are you planning on parenting
these children together?

01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:58.785
Don't judge us, Palmer,
and you of all people.

01:17:58.818 --> 01:18:01.788
Woah. What... what... what's
that supposed to mean?

01:18:01.821 --> 01:18:03.322
You pretend to be
this nice family guy,

01:18:03.356 --> 01:18:05.858
but I just saw you swiping
Tinder in the men's room.

01:18:05.892 --> 01:18:06.859
Is that true?

01:18:06.893 --> 01:18:08.895
No, no, no, no,

01:18:08.928 --> 01:18:11.064
I wasn't swiping,

01:18:11.097 --> 01:18:15.034
I was messaging Amandda,

01:18:15.068 --> 01:18:16.302
it's two Ds.

01:18:16.335 --> 01:18:18.037
We might
go out for drinks later.

01:18:18.071 --> 01:18:19.105
Wow.

01:18:19.138 --> 01:18:20.940
How does your wife
feel about that?

01:18:20.973 --> 01:18:22.409
My wife?

01:18:22.443 --> 01:18:25.278
Yeah, the woman in the pictures with
your children, or did you forget?

01:18:25.311 --> 01:18:28.915
Oh, I never technically said
that was my wife.

01:18:28.948 --> 01:18:29.749
That's my sister.

01:18:30.349 --> 01:18:32.218
And those are
my nephews and nieces.

01:18:32.985 --> 01:18:35.321
Wait, wait, your...
your sister is your wife?

01:18:35.354 --> 01:18:39.292
- No, no, I don't have kids.
- Wait, you don't have kids?

01:18:40.293 --> 01:18:42.795
I... I've seen
what they do to couples.

01:18:42.829 --> 01:18:47.934
I borrow hers every few weekends,
in doses they are great.

01:18:47.967 --> 01:18:49.268
I told you
a male gyno is creepy.

01:18:50.069 --> 01:18:52.605
We gotta tell Taylor
about the two-for-one special.

01:18:54.373 --> 01:18:57.076
She's the fourth parent
in this arrangement.

01:19:00.913 --> 01:19:03.049
Well, I think we know
what needs to be done.

01:19:03.082 --> 01:19:04.617
Sell one of them?

01:19:05.852 --> 01:19:06.719
No, God, no.

01:19:06.752 --> 01:19:09.188
Good. good. Then we're
on the same page.

01:19:09.222 --> 01:19:11.190
Guys, it's fine, they're twins.

01:19:11.224 --> 01:19:14.127
We'll just split them up
and we each take one baby.

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.328
Split them up?

01:19:15.361 --> 01:19:16.762
They are siblings.

01:19:16.796 --> 01:19:20.299
We're all gonna end up on the
<i>Jerry Springer Show</i> in ten years.

01:19:20.333 --> 01:19:22.201
You're actually
showing your age a bit.

01:19:22.235 --> 01:19:24.804
It's not the <i>Jerry Springer Show</i>
anymore, it's <i>Steve Wilkos</i>.

01:19:24.837 --> 01:19:26.806
- Steve who?
- The bodyguard.

01:19:26.839 --> 01:19:27.907
He has his own show now.

01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:30.843
Okay, guys, why are we talking
about Steve Wilkos?

01:19:30.877 --> 01:19:33.179
'Cause your wife is
twelve years old.

01:19:33.212 --> 01:19:35.081
Well, at least
I'm not geriatric.

01:19:35.114 --> 01:19:37.350
- Ouch.
- Come on, come on, let's all just settle down.

01:19:37.384 --> 01:19:39.919
Let's go across the street,
we'll get some protein,

01:19:39.952 --> 01:19:42.155
we'll finish this conversation
like adults. I'm starving.

01:19:42.188 --> 01:19:44.056
You're starving?
I'm eating for three.

01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:45.526
If I can wait, you can wait.

01:19:45.559 --> 01:19:49.128
And I am not talking about the future
of our children in a Panera Bread.

01:19:49.162 --> 01:19:50.963
Hey, stop. Everybody stop.

01:19:51.831 --> 01:19:52.899
I got it.

01:19:53.900 --> 01:19:56.335
We're not gonna split
them up, that's immoral.

01:19:56.369 --> 01:19:57.370
Thank you.

01:19:58.905 --> 01:20:01.908
And also if we each have one to ourselves,
what was the point of all of this?

01:20:02.842 --> 01:20:04.343
We just cut in
another couple.

01:20:07.947 --> 01:20:11.784
So instead of a half share,
we each have a one-third share and a baby.

01:20:11.817 --> 01:20:13.786
Well, babies.

01:20:13.819 --> 01:20:15.254
Yeah, Don, your math is wrong.

01:20:15.988 --> 01:20:18.257
So it's two babies being shared
by three couples.

01:20:19.058 --> 01:20:24.063
So each couple has a third of
two, so two-third share of a baby.

01:20:24.096 --> 01:20:27.934
But he said each of us. Three
couples, that's six people.

01:20:27.967 --> 01:20:32.371
Okay, you're right. So divided by
two, that's one-third each, okay?

01:20:32.406 --> 01:20:36.042
Hey, reframed that way,
that's an improvement, right?

01:20:36.075 --> 01:20:38.978
Three couples, two babies,
one perfect plan.

01:20:39.379 --> 01:20:42.348
I'm just gonna put this out there.
We're covering art, math, science, right?

01:20:42.382 --> 01:20:44.384
And they're
covering dance and sports.

01:20:44.418 --> 01:20:46.986
We want the most well-rounded
baby, right?

01:20:47.019 --> 01:20:48.921
Tolerant, empathetic...

01:20:50.957 --> 01:20:51.991
Well-dressed.

01:20:53.092 --> 01:20:56.028
Hey, Evan and Dale?

01:20:56.062 --> 01:20:57.230
- That's us.
- Please call me Nate.

01:20:57.263 --> 01:20:58.798
- Great.
- Beautiful home.

01:20:58.831 --> 01:21:01.133
- Oh, it's not mine.
- Hey. I'm Don.

01:21:01.968 --> 01:21:04.003
- Hi.
- It's my wife Taylor.

01:21:04.036 --> 01:21:04.937
Hi.

01:21:05.304 --> 01:21:07.139
Well, we... we love kids.

01:21:07.173 --> 01:21:09.208
My cousin takes a trip
every summer

01:21:09.242 --> 01:21:13.279
to visit his wife's family
in Vietnam and we take the kids.

01:21:13.312 --> 01:21:14.847
It's an absolute joy.

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.417
And after last summer, well,

01:21:17.451 --> 01:21:20.820
we knew we wanted our own and
started looking into adoption.

01:21:20.853 --> 01:21:23.423
It would be our life's joy
to raise your children.

01:21:23.457 --> 01:21:28.462
I assume the agency explained the
arrangement that we're looking for?

01:21:30.263 --> 01:21:34.834
Yeah, we're not looking for the two of
you to raise the children on your own.

01:21:34.867 --> 01:21:38.838
They said that you were open
to an unconventional situation.

01:21:38.871 --> 01:21:42.341
Yeah, so we didn't think that there
would be an issue with us being two dads.

01:21:42.376 --> 01:21:45.111
- I... I mean we should probably go.
- No, no, no, no, that's...

01:21:45.144 --> 01:21:47.246
That's not it at all.
This is actually our preference.

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.914
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

01:21:48.948 --> 01:21:50.216
- Great.
- Yeah.

01:21:50.249 --> 01:21:54.186
- It's not that we need to be open to unconventional.
- Yeah.

01:21:55.121 --> 01:21:56.922
It's a bit more
complicated than that.

01:21:57.391 --> 01:21:58.392
Go on.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.194
- We really think you're perfect.
- Can't you give us an answer now?

01:22:02.228 --> 01:22:03.430
- Uh...
- We'll think about it.

01:22:03.463 --> 01:22:05.131
- Yeah.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:22:06.265 --> 01:22:10.369
Well, call us, email
or text, we're around.

01:22:11.337 --> 01:22:12.606
No.

01:22:12.639 --> 01:22:13.973
You don't want this?

01:22:14.006 --> 01:22:14.940
- No.
- No.

01:22:14.974 --> 01:22:16.342
- Um... No.
- Um... No.

01:22:16.376 --> 01:22:17.977
- So yes, right?
- Yes?

01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:18.844
- I mean maybe?
- Maybe?

01:22:18.878 --> 01:22:21.347
We actually have
to go. We got a dog.

01:22:21.381 --> 01:22:22.882
- The dogs.
- Dogs. The dogs.

01:22:22.915 --> 01:22:24.950
- Yeah.
- Well, thanks for considering us.

01:22:25.385 --> 01:22:28.854
We're looking for something
a little more...

01:22:30.256 --> 01:22:31.357
Traditional.

01:22:38.898 --> 01:22:43.869
So we've decided against the
timeshare fractional parenthood plan.

01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:46.305
Oh, that's good.

01:22:46.339 --> 01:22:48.341
Two of you will
make fine parents.

01:22:48.374 --> 01:22:50.976
I'm sure you can figure something
out for donor visitations.

01:22:51.010 --> 01:22:52.278
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

01:22:52.311 --> 01:22:55.081
We're not taking both,
we're splitting them up one baby each.

01:22:55.114 --> 01:22:59.285
I mean it's not what we wanted but I
agree it's better than trading off twins.

01:22:59.318 --> 01:23:01.087
I just want a baby.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.288
Mm-hmm.

01:23:02.321 --> 01:23:03.889
Okay, well,

01:23:05.191 --> 01:23:07.893
anyone like
to take a guess what that is?

01:23:08.662 --> 01:23:09.962
Another heart?

01:23:09.995 --> 01:23:11.130
It's a penis.

01:23:12.198 --> 01:23:13.899
We got a boy. Okay.

01:23:14.367 --> 01:23:15.101
And a girl.

01:23:15.134 --> 01:23:17.404
- And a girl.
- Fraternal twins.

01:23:18.170 --> 01:23:20.973
There you go. You can go clean yourself up.
Let's get up.

01:23:21.006 --> 01:23:22.376
We'll...
we'll help her out.

01:23:22.409 --> 01:23:24.110
- Okay. Good.
- Yeah.

01:23:24.143 --> 01:23:26.245
- How is that? Comfortable?
- Yeah.

01:23:26.278 --> 01:23:28.948
Awesome. Okay. Well.

01:23:28.981 --> 01:23:31.150
Since Sarah's creating them we
probably get first dibs.

01:23:31.183 --> 01:23:32.218
Oh yeah, he's got a point.

01:23:32.251 --> 01:23:35.921
- Sorry Don. I think we get the... boy.
- Girl.

01:23:35.955 --> 01:23:40.394
What? No. I'm pushing this baby
out of my vagina, I want the girl.

01:23:40.427 --> 01:23:43.095
- I just assumed, I didn't know...
- Of course you assume.

01:23:43.129 --> 01:23:45.231
- As you assumed. You said girl.
- It's a total bias.

01:23:45.264 --> 01:23:46.833
But you wanted the girl.
How was that not a bias?

01:23:46.867 --> 01:23:50.670
This is... since this is my sperm that
created them, I'll make this easy for you.

01:23:50.704 --> 01:23:54.173
- We'll take the boy.
- What, how does that make it easy? I want the girl.

01:23:54.206 --> 01:23:55.341
It's you guys
that want the boy.

01:23:55.374 --> 01:23:56.942
- We want a boy.
- We?

01:23:56.976 --> 01:23:59.679
Yeah, we want a boy. We've
always talked... yes, we tried.

01:23:59.713 --> 01:24:02.181
- I said I wanted a girl...
- And how was that any different?

01:24:02.214 --> 01:24:04.216
I've always wanted a boy.

01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:07.687
Look at us, we can't even agree
within a couple, we're fucked.

01:24:09.756 --> 01:24:11.223
Why don't you flip a coin?

01:24:12.426 --> 01:24:13.959
We're not flipping a coin.

01:24:15.595 --> 01:24:18.197
This is a child. Our actions are gonna
determine the course of their entire life.

01:24:20.266 --> 01:24:23.269
It's either monkey balls or a
midget with a prolapsed rectum.

01:24:25.271 --> 01:24:26.740
I'm gonna go with the midget.

01:24:26.773 --> 01:24:28.642
That's ten. Yes.

01:24:28.675 --> 01:24:31.277
Hold on. She... she has
nine, it's win by two.

01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:35.214
We didn't say that. We said the first person
to get ten black cards wins. That's me.

01:24:35.247 --> 01:24:38.050
- Win by two is pretty standard.
- Yeah, let's do a tiebreaker.

01:24:38.083 --> 01:24:41.253
No, no, no, one game, one winner,
that person gets the pick of the litter.

01:24:41.287 --> 01:24:44.023
I guess I'm just gonna let
you figure this one out.

01:24:44.056 --> 01:24:46.325
- Are you giving up?
- No, I'm just going to the bathroom.

01:24:46.358 --> 01:24:47.394
I'll be right back.

01:24:49.228 --> 01:24:51.330
- What are we gonna do?
- Let's do another round.

01:24:51.363 --> 01:24:53.299
When she gets back, we're
gonna do another round.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.723
- Like that?
- Who says win by two? This isn't basketball.

01:25:16.756 --> 01:25:18.324
But we... it's like
the national rules.

01:25:21.795 --> 01:25:23.430
- That's fine.
- Hey, what's wrong?

01:25:24.431 --> 01:25:25.465
Hey, what's the matter?

01:25:27.767 --> 01:25:29.235
I'm pregnant.

01:25:30.837 --> 01:25:32.371
- What?
- What?

01:25:32.405 --> 01:25:35.341
- No.
- No. The egg situation, you can't be.

01:25:35.374 --> 01:25:39.813
No, Don, I... I wasn't ready.
I mean I'm only 27.

01:25:39.846 --> 01:25:42.114
So what, you lied
about the egg test?

01:25:42.147 --> 01:25:43.450
No, I never took the test.

01:25:43.483 --> 01:25:46.218
I just heard that Sarah did and
I just figured that, you know,

01:25:46.252 --> 01:25:50.322
when I turned 30, I would tell you
that I retook the test and had eggs

01:25:50.356 --> 01:25:52.792
and it would have been fine.
You... you wouldn't have known.

01:25:54.159 --> 01:25:56.463
Wait, wait, wait, but how... how
could you be pregnant though?

01:25:56.496 --> 01:25:58.398
- Dude, she just told you.
- No, no. No.

01:25:58.431 --> 01:26:01.434
We haven't had sex since
everything happened between us.

01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:04.303
Taylor has been disinterested
in that department.

01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:10.443
Hey, um...

01:26:11.845 --> 01:26:13.380
Taylor and I need
to tell you something.

01:26:13.413 --> 01:26:14.381
We slept together.

01:26:16.716 --> 01:26:18.284
- What?
- One time.

01:26:18.317 --> 01:26:19.452
Just once.

01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:23.122
Did you get confused about the
plan or something? What the fuck?

01:26:23.155 --> 01:26:25.190
You're having an affair?

01:26:25.224 --> 01:26:28.127
- No. No, no, no, it's nothing like that.
- No.

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.863
- Not at all.
- No, it's nothing like that.

01:26:29.896 --> 01:26:33.132
Well, we both had these feelings
of jealousy and... and resentment.

01:26:33.165 --> 01:26:35.835
- Yes, resentment, jealousy.
- Because of what we saw.

01:26:35.869 --> 01:26:36.770
Okay, okay.

01:26:37.737 --> 01:26:41.206
Oh, God, I feel... I feel...
I feel so sick.

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.310
Okay, we slept on it and we
talked to our therapist and...

01:26:44.343 --> 01:26:46.278
Your therapist
signed off on this?

01:26:46.312 --> 01:26:48.782
Well, no, not exactly, but we
talked about it

01:26:48.815 --> 01:26:51.384
and we decided that if we slept
together one time,

01:26:51.418 --> 01:26:54.253
it would even things out and
the resentment would go away.

01:26:54.286 --> 01:26:55.220
Did it work?

01:26:55.254 --> 01:26:56.489
Yeah, pretty much.

01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:59.091
- It did. It did.
- Yeah.

01:26:59.826 --> 01:27:03.362
- To be honest, we didn't even really enjoy that much. I mean...
- Please.

01:27:03.396 --> 01:27:05.865
I mean it was... it was awkward
and sweaty and strange.

01:27:05.899 --> 01:27:08.802
- It wasn't great.
- I mean I... I barely felt it, if that means anything.

01:27:08.835 --> 01:27:10.235
Okay, that's enough.

01:27:10.269 --> 01:27:12.171
- I didn't.
- Hold on. Hold on.

01:27:13.473 --> 01:27:15.875
You had unprotected sex?

01:27:16.876 --> 01:27:20.179
No, no, I used a condom.
I'm positive. Right?

01:27:20.212 --> 01:27:21.815
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:27:22.348 --> 01:27:23.783
Which ones?

01:27:23.817 --> 01:27:26.318
- What?
- Which condoms did you use?

01:27:27.319 --> 01:27:30.155
- I took the ones out of the nightstand.
- Oh, God.

01:27:30.189 --> 01:27:33.225
What?

01:27:33.793 --> 01:27:35.361
I need to tell you something.

01:27:35.395 --> 01:27:39.331
I may have taken matters
into my own hands

01:27:39.365 --> 01:27:41.434
with those
a few months ago.

01:27:42.736 --> 01:27:44.838
You sabotaged my condoms?

01:27:45.505 --> 01:27:48.875
Oh my God. Oh my God.

01:27:49.776 --> 01:27:51.310
You left me no choice!

01:27:51.343 --> 01:27:52.746
I left you no choice?

01:27:52.779 --> 01:27:56.950
Three kids, two couples,
one failed fucking plan.

01:27:56.983 --> 01:27:59.819
This is pretty much
the worst of all worlds.

01:27:59.853 --> 01:28:01.921
Am I the only one that doesn't
have a secret around here?

01:28:01.955 --> 01:28:03.188
Possibly.

01:28:03.222 --> 01:28:07.292
See, Jeff? We'd be better off
having our own kid, a full baby,

01:28:07.326 --> 01:28:10.697
because we'd be two down
from the current count

01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:14.401
and we wouldn't have played
wife-swap fuck me edition.

01:28:14.434 --> 01:28:17.971
Okay, okay, let's not freak out just yet. Okay,
it could be a false positive. That happens.

01:28:18.004 --> 01:28:19.806
I peed on four sticks.

01:28:19.839 --> 01:28:21.240
With our luck
it's fucking twins.

01:28:21.273 --> 01:28:22.274
One,

01:28:23.410 --> 01:28:24.444
two,

01:28:25.545 --> 01:28:27.814
three, we got triplets.

01:28:27.847 --> 01:28:29.348
He said triplets, didn't he?

01:28:29.382 --> 01:28:31.418
He did say that.
He said triplets.

01:28:31.451 --> 01:28:32.686
- Yes, he did.
- Okay.

01:28:32.719 --> 01:28:34.319
That's triplets. Wow.

01:28:34.888 --> 01:28:37.222
That is...
that is big news for all.

01:28:37.256 --> 01:28:40.493
So, whose are these?

01:28:40.527 --> 01:28:41.828
Yeah, they're mine.

01:28:41.861 --> 01:28:43.797
Jeff, I thought you're
shooting blanks.

01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:44.998
No, I lied.

01:28:45.031 --> 01:28:47.967
Triplets, how is that
even possible?

01:28:48.001 --> 01:28:51.438
Well, it says here that your HCG
levels are extremely high

01:28:51.471 --> 01:28:53.238
which can result
in a multiple pregnancy.

01:28:53.272 --> 01:28:54.708
You've been taking
fertility drugs?

01:28:54.741 --> 01:28:56.241
Never. Never in my life.

01:28:56.275 --> 01:28:57.877
Actually, um...

01:28:58.878 --> 01:29:00.947
Actually what?

01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:02.214
I need to tell you something.

01:29:02.247 --> 01:29:04.384
- No, what did you do, Don? What did you do?
- Oh my God.

01:29:04.417 --> 01:29:06.351
The supplements.

01:29:08.855 --> 01:29:12.459
What? You spiked my smoothies?
Who does that?

01:29:12.492 --> 01:29:14.828
- I wanted a kid.
- Well, now you have three.

01:29:14.861 --> 01:29:18.998
He has three and you have two.
Oh, God.

01:29:20.467 --> 01:29:22.469
The fucking smoothies.

01:29:22.502 --> 01:29:24.336
Fucking smoothies.

01:29:25.505 --> 01:29:27.874
Just want to confirm,
he definitely said three?

01:29:28.808 --> 01:29:32.479
- Yup.
- Okay. Yeah. Good. That's what I heard too.

01:29:54.734 --> 01:29:56.335
- You think I can... Okay.
- No.

01:30:16.523 --> 01:30:18.024
Well,
you're gonna love it, Jeff.

01:30:18.892 --> 01:30:20.860
Here's the title and the keys.

01:30:21.995 --> 01:30:22.962
Alright.

01:30:52.826 --> 01:30:54.861
This is the worst idea ever.

01:30:54.894 --> 01:30:58.398
It's not forever, it's just
sub-leasing so we can afford it again.

01:30:58.431 --> 01:31:01.034
They're being nice.
They're letting us stay with them.

01:31:01.067 --> 01:31:04.003
Look, it's just that I didn't...
I didn't expect this scenario.

01:31:04.037 --> 01:31:05.939
I did not expect
to feel like this.

01:31:05.972 --> 01:31:10.076
I didn't plan for my ankles to be
swollen to the size of grapefruits.

01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:12.145
I'm fine with you cutting back
in your hours, I get it.

01:31:12.178 --> 01:31:16.015
It's just that I can't afford to
take care of us, let alone five kids.

01:31:16.049 --> 01:31:18.551
You asked to be demoted.

01:33:51.938 --> 01:33:53.573
Can someone shut that rat up?

01:33:54.907 --> 01:33:56.209
- Did he just...
- Mm-hmm.

01:33:58.611 --> 01:33:59.912
It's okay, baby.

01:34:03.983 --> 01:34:05.985
No texting at the table.

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.755
It's my mother.

01:34:08.788 --> 01:34:09.789
Do it later.

01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:12.125
You've got to get
used to device-free meals.

01:34:12.158 --> 01:34:15.528
I'm almost done. She's texting to
set a date for the christening.

01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:21.968
Christening?

01:34:22.001 --> 01:34:24.137
We agreed that we're
gonna raise the child agnostic.

01:34:24.170 --> 01:34:25.338
I know.

01:34:25.371 --> 01:34:26.706
It doesn't mean anything.

01:34:26.739 --> 01:34:29.308
It's just... it's a family
tradition, it'll make my mom happy.

01:34:29.342 --> 01:34:30.543
It's non-starter.

01:34:30.576 --> 01:34:33.079
You have to find something
else that makes your mom happy.

01:34:33.112 --> 01:34:35.782
It's what my father would have
wanted, you heartless asshole.

01:34:35.815 --> 01:34:39.052
Okay, your dad wants to support an institution
that supports a bunch of child molesters?

01:34:39.085 --> 01:34:40.319
Look, you two stop.

01:34:41.587 --> 01:34:44.090
- I should have never fucked your wife.
- But you did.

01:34:50.797 --> 01:34:53.366
Taylor, these potatoes are
delicious. What's in them?

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:56.369
It's a family recipe,
the secret ingredient is bacon.

01:34:56.403 --> 01:34:57.570
Bacon?

01:34:58.137 --> 01:34:59.806
- Mh-hm.
- Here we go.

01:35:01.174 --> 01:35:04.210
I'm feeding my unborn
children pig carcass?

01:35:04.243 --> 01:35:05.645
Well, it was humanely raised.

01:35:05.678 --> 01:35:09.182
I mean I took a moment to thank
the pig for giving us its life, so.

01:35:09.215 --> 01:35:11.884
Oh really? He volunteered?

01:35:11.918 --> 01:35:13.953
I told you I'm raising
my children vegan,

01:35:13.986 --> 01:35:16.055
that includes
while they're in the womb.

01:35:16.089 --> 01:35:17.924
Whoa, whoa, whoa, vegan?

01:35:17.957 --> 01:35:19.292
We never talked about that.

01:35:19.992 --> 01:35:21.227
How's he gonna get protein?

01:35:21.260 --> 01:35:24.097
There are plenty of ways
for them to get protein.

01:35:24.130 --> 01:35:26.999
But of course a meathead
like you is totally fine

01:35:27.033 --> 01:35:30.103
with killing innocent beings
for your own fucking vanity.

01:35:30.136 --> 01:35:31.572
What's the time limit
on abortions?

01:35:34.373 --> 01:35:37.877
Not proposing it, I'm just
wondering what is the legal on it,

01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:39.278
just in case Don
proposes it.

01:35:40.847 --> 01:35:41.981
What is wrong with you?

01:35:42.014 --> 01:35:44.050
- Stop talking, Jeff.
- Okay.

01:35:44.984 --> 01:35:48.187
If you hadn't put a three-pack up in
Taylor, we won't even be in this situation.

01:35:48.221 --> 01:35:49.155
- It's my fault.
- Yeah.

01:35:49.188 --> 01:35:51.290
- It's always fucking my fault.
- Yeah.

01:35:51.324 --> 01:35:53.993
Okay, it's my fault that my
super semen threaded the needle

01:35:54.026 --> 01:35:57.930
through a sabotaged condom and did an
individual medley up into your wife's uterus.

01:35:57.964 --> 01:35:59.866
- God, that is so gross.
- Stop.

01:35:59.899 --> 01:36:02.235
Okay, can we just not
talk about that?

01:36:03.903 --> 01:36:05.004
Guys, this isn't working.

01:36:05.037 --> 01:36:08.174
- Well, clearly it's not, okay?
- We should break up.

01:36:08.207 --> 01:36:09.108
Wait, what?

01:36:10.309 --> 01:36:14.381
- No, no, no, no, we should break up with them.
- Oh, yeah.

01:36:16.883 --> 01:36:17.950
Yeah. You know what?

01:36:19.051 --> 01:36:20.153
It's not working. We shouldn't
be friends anymore.

01:36:20.186 --> 01:36:22.788
We're gonna be shitty parents.
This is what we'll do.

01:36:22.822 --> 01:36:24.290
We take our babies
once Taylor has them

01:36:24.323 --> 01:36:26.159
and you take your babies
once Sarah has them

01:36:26.192 --> 01:36:28.060
and then we just
go our separate ways. Deal?

01:36:28.094 --> 01:36:29.295
- Perfect. Deal.
- Deal.

01:36:30.096 --> 01:36:31.797
- I'm sorry.
- Great.

01:36:31.831 --> 01:36:33.166
Your babies?

01:36:33.199 --> 01:36:35.268
- These babies inside me are my fucking babies too.
- They are...

01:36:35.301 --> 01:36:37.069
They're our babies.
They're our babies.

01:36:37.103 --> 01:36:39.071
You just claimed five babies.

01:36:39.105 --> 01:36:43.943
Why don't we all just split up,
take one baby each, four single parents.

01:36:43.976 --> 01:36:45.945
We could draw straws
for the leftover baby.

01:36:45.978 --> 01:36:48.181
Better yet, we can let
that fucking rat raise it.

01:36:48.214 --> 01:36:51.851
Don't you talk
about Punky Woofster like that.

01:36:54.353 --> 01:36:56.322
- Oh, it hurts.
- Babe, what's the matter?

01:36:56.355 --> 01:36:57.424
- Fuck, it hurts.
- Babe.

01:37:16.275 --> 01:37:19.413
So, I don't see any heartbeats.

01:37:22.248 --> 01:37:23.349
Are you sure?

01:37:23.383 --> 01:37:24.951
Yeah.

01:37:24.984 --> 01:37:28.788
I have been dancing a lot.
Could that have caused it?

01:37:28.821 --> 01:37:32.325
Doubtful. Women can exercise well
into their pregnancy without issue.

01:37:32.358 --> 01:37:33.960
It's completely normal.

01:37:33.993 --> 01:37:35.795
Happens almost fifty
percent of the time,

01:37:35.828 --> 01:37:38.998
and it bears no significance
for your next pregnancy.

01:37:40.299 --> 01:37:41.367
Take as long as you want.

01:37:47.373 --> 01:37:49.141
Can you guys give us a minute?

01:38:10.062 --> 01:38:11.163
You know, she's right.

01:38:12.265 --> 01:38:13.833
'Cause I went through it too.

01:38:14.867 --> 01:38:16.836
It was years ago before Jeff.

01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:18.838
I never told him.

01:38:20.106 --> 01:38:23.377
I mean, they were here
and now they're not.

01:38:24.243 --> 01:38:29.115
You know, my mom told me about this
Buddhist saint for times like this.

01:38:29.148 --> 01:38:31.851
The Patron Saint
of Miscarriages?

01:38:32.918 --> 01:38:37.424
They believed that a baby who hasn't been
born yet can't go to heaven on their own

01:38:37.457 --> 01:38:40.226
since they haven't had time
to accumulate good karma.

01:38:40.259 --> 01:38:41.994
But that's
where the saint comes in.

01:38:42.396 --> 01:38:44.196
I mean he's
essentially a badass.

01:38:44.930 --> 01:38:49.135
He smuggles their souls to
paradise up his fucking sleeves.

01:38:50.303 --> 01:38:52.104
I like the way this dude rolls.

01:38:52.938 --> 01:38:53.973
What's his name?

01:38:55.642 --> 01:38:56.842
Jizo.

01:38:57.411 --> 01:38:58.478
Jizo?

01:38:58.512 --> 01:39:03.983
Yeah, Jizo. Yeah, I know.
Maybe not the best name.

01:39:05.084 --> 01:39:06.052
Is it bad that,

01:39:07.186 --> 01:39:08.854
given how they got there,

01:39:10.022 --> 01:39:11.857
I feel a little bit relieved?

01:39:26.305 --> 01:39:27.940
I'm sorry, babe.

01:39:36.015 --> 01:39:37.016
Come on.

01:39:48.662 --> 01:39:50.430
Well, it looks like
we're back down to two.

01:39:51.665 --> 01:39:53.467
Seems manageable
all of a sudden.

01:40:06.278 --> 01:40:09.148
Coming through.

01:40:10.983 --> 01:40:13.252
Jeff, heard you wanted to chat.

01:40:13.285 --> 01:40:14.987
Yeah, yeah, thanks. Come on in.

01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:17.123
- Hey.
- How are you?

01:40:18.124 --> 01:40:19.191
Little bummed out.

01:40:19.225 --> 01:40:20.694
I got another
speeding ticket today.

01:40:20.727 --> 01:40:22.995
It's the third one this month
and it's only the seventh.

01:40:23.028 --> 01:40:26.232
- What?
- I know. I usually get three a month, but not that fast.

01:40:26.265 --> 01:40:27.233
Not this month.

01:40:27.266 --> 01:40:29.068
It's the white Maserati, man.

01:40:29.436 --> 01:40:32.972
Yeah. So listen, I know you got a lot...
a lot on your plate. Um...

01:40:33.005 --> 01:40:34.940
I've been meaning
to ask you something.

01:40:36.242 --> 01:40:37.677
I put some reflection...

01:40:37.711 --> 01:40:39.413
You're gonna ask
for your old job back?

01:40:41.113 --> 01:40:42.114
Yeah.

01:40:42.148 --> 01:40:43.182
Yeah.

01:40:44.718 --> 01:40:48.154
You got it on your screen mirror right
here, like the whole conversation.

01:40:48.187 --> 01:40:50.156
I heard you were
having trouble with that.

01:40:50.189 --> 01:40:52.124
Good job on getting it up.

01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:56.396
"Financially, things have been tough. We're
expecting twins." You're expecting twins?

01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:57.930
That's great.

01:40:59.433 --> 01:41:03.335
"Wait for tantrum, probably about his
Maserati." You... you knew I would.

01:41:03.369 --> 01:41:05.405
Yeah. And... okay.

01:41:05.439 --> 01:41:07.239
I was just getting
to the good stuff.

01:41:09.141 --> 01:41:10.710
So what do you think
about the first part?

01:41:11.343 --> 01:41:12.679
I filled the position.

01:41:12.712 --> 01:41:17.149
- Come on.
- Jeff, I... I gave it away, it's already... it's done.

01:41:17.183 --> 01:41:21.253
Right now it's either fields
or the front door.

01:41:21.287 --> 01:41:23.155
I'm really sorry, man.

01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:24.658
Alright, I got... I gotta go.

01:41:24.691 --> 01:41:26.125
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Alright? Just...

01:41:26.158 --> 01:41:28.060
I love you. Never forget.

01:41:47.747 --> 01:41:50.149
Let's go. Go, Don. Go, Don.

01:41:51.751 --> 01:41:53.653
- We're ready?
- Everybody in?

01:41:53.687 --> 01:41:55.221
Let's go. Go, go, go.

01:41:55.254 --> 01:41:56.756
Okay. Yeah, you okay?

01:41:56.790 --> 01:42:00.025
- Yeah. Whoo.
- You okay?

01:42:06.500 --> 01:42:09.301
It fucking just keeps going
to the answering service.

01:42:09.335 --> 01:42:12.137
Okay, just go to C. Jones.
He said he's there at Tuesdays, okay.

01:42:12.171 --> 01:42:14.073
Fucker's probably
on another date.

01:42:14.106 --> 01:42:16.308
Call again!

01:42:18.411 --> 01:42:21.180
- Can you go any faster?
- It's a Previa.

01:43:05.825 --> 01:43:07.827
Are you comfortable? Do you
want me to go lower?

01:43:08.428 --> 01:43:10.397
It... it was perfect.

01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:13.198
It's too...
it's too low, go back, go back.

01:43:13.232 --> 01:43:16.770
Too... too... too high. Lower.

01:43:16.803 --> 01:43:19.439
- Sorry.
- Higher. Higher.

01:43:20.707 --> 01:43:22.107
What is wrong with you?

01:43:22.141 --> 01:43:23.643
I've never had one of these.

01:43:23.677 --> 01:43:26.680
If you could just take the attitude
down a small notch, that would be great.

01:43:26.713 --> 01:43:29.783
Sir, Dr. Young is
on call right now.

01:43:29.816 --> 01:43:31.150
No, we need Palmer.

01:43:31.183 --> 01:43:35.789
I have no idea why we actually want
him, he's a horrible doctor,

01:43:35.822 --> 01:43:38.290
but he's been with us from the
beginning and Sarah wants him.

01:43:38.324 --> 01:43:40.460
I'm sorry, he just headed
out for the day.

01:43:40.493 --> 01:43:41.226
Headed?

01:43:41.895 --> 01:43:44.129
So he... he's still
in the building?

01:43:44.163 --> 01:43:45.164
I didn't say that.

01:43:45.197 --> 01:43:46.265
Be right back, babe.

01:43:46.298 --> 01:43:48.167
- You can't...
- Yeah, I can.

01:43:50.369 --> 01:43:51.303
You should go too.

01:43:51.337 --> 01:43:52.439
Don't tell me what to do.

01:43:53.305 --> 01:43:54.741
I'm gonna leave
'cause I want to.

01:43:57.309 --> 01:44:01.381
Oh, you know, he's weird
and the swiping, I don't care,

01:44:01.414 --> 01:44:04.417
I want Palmer. Yeah.

01:44:04.451 --> 01:44:05.952
- Alright.
- Where is he?

01:44:05.986 --> 01:44:09.154
Don went to find him, alright? But
maybe it'd be okay with another doctor.

01:44:09.188 --> 01:44:10.189
Hi.

01:44:11.190 --> 01:44:12.826
- Yeah, you said this.
- He's looking for him.

01:44:12.859 --> 01:44:14.928
You already said this.
I want Palmer!

01:44:14.961 --> 01:44:16.429
Can you get Palmer?

01:44:16.463 --> 01:44:17.731
I'll see what I can do.

01:44:29.843 --> 01:44:30.777
Yeah.

01:44:34.414 --> 01:44:36.416
Alright, let's do this.

01:44:38.418 --> 01:44:40.020
You came back.

01:44:40.053 --> 01:44:43.456
These kids better turn out amazing because
you should see the date I just cancelled.

01:44:44.391 --> 01:44:46.760
Just do your fucking job
because this hurts.

01:44:48.828 --> 01:44:50.229
Okay.

01:44:56.836 --> 01:44:58.203
- Jesus.
- Is that her?

01:44:58.237 --> 01:44:58.938
Yeah.

01:44:59.472 --> 01:45:00.740
Do you think she's okay?

01:45:03.476 --> 01:45:06.413
Are you guys the other parents?

01:45:06.446 --> 01:45:07.380
Yeah.

01:45:08.815 --> 01:45:12.686
First one is out. It's a boy.
And mom's doing great. Congratulations.

01:45:12.719 --> 01:45:14.219
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:45:15.822 --> 01:45:17.289
Babe, we are parents.

01:45:18.458 --> 01:45:20.359
Fucking parents.

01:45:24.931 --> 01:45:27.299
Alright, good job, Sarah.

01:45:27.332 --> 01:45:28.935
We got one down, two to go.

01:45:29.969 --> 01:45:31.336
- What?
- Two?

01:45:31.905 --> 01:45:34.239
Just kidding. One.

01:45:34.273 --> 01:45:36.275
- Fucking asshole.
- It's not funny.

01:45:36.308 --> 01:45:37.276
Okay.

01:45:37.309 --> 01:45:39.311
- Alright.
- You're gonna be fine.

01:45:39.344 --> 01:45:40.847
- Ready for more?
- No.

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:42.982
- You got this.
- I can't do it. I can't do it.

01:45:43.016 --> 01:45:43.883
You can do it. You can do it.

01:45:43.917 --> 01:45:46.318
We're doing it.
We're doing it.

01:45:46.351 --> 01:45:47.286
Okay.

01:45:54.427 --> 01:45:56.696
Why are they...
Why are they...

01:45:56.730 --> 01:45:58.998
- Baby's heart rate is down.
- What is going on?

01:45:59.032 --> 01:46:00.365
What... what is she saying?

01:46:02.168 --> 01:46:04.838
It looks like they are just getting
everything ready. Everything looks okay. Yeah.

01:46:04.871 --> 01:46:07.507
- What if the babies...
- I don't know. I don't know. None of it matters.

01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:09.308
Hey, we are here. We are here.

01:46:09.341 --> 01:46:11.444
We are getting out, you and I.
It's all that matters.

01:46:12.045 --> 01:46:13.546
Here you're doing it
for all of us.

01:46:14.514 --> 01:46:18.350
You don't even want a baby.
You wanted half a baby.

01:46:18.818 --> 01:46:22.021
I want a full baby with you.

01:46:22.822 --> 01:46:24.157
Okay? With you. With you.

01:46:24.190 --> 01:46:27.026
- Here we go. You got this.
- Sarah, it's about time.

01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:28.194
- You got this.
- No, I can't.

01:46:28.228 --> 01:46:31.698
You got this. Yes, you do.
Yes, you do. You can do, okay.

01:46:31.731 --> 01:46:33.399
- Okay.
- We're gonna do this on three.

01:46:33.433 --> 01:46:35.401
- Yeah.
- You ready? Okay.

01:46:35.435 --> 01:46:39.973
One, two, three. Okay.

01:46:53.386 --> 01:46:54.721
Jeff.

01:46:56.523 --> 01:46:57.891
Hey.

01:46:58.792 --> 01:46:59.859
This is them?

01:47:03.496 --> 01:47:04.998
Yeah. It's them.

01:47:05.031 --> 01:47:07.534
I think he's got your eyes.

01:47:09.368 --> 01:47:10.335
Sure.

01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:13.406
Jeff, buddy,

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:18.343
go home, get some rest,
you've got newborns, alright? It's okay.

01:47:20.013 --> 01:47:24.417
I just want to say thank you
for the... for the un-demotion,

01:47:24.450 --> 01:47:26.920
the re-promotion.

01:47:28.021 --> 01:47:29.255
Oh my God.

01:47:29.289 --> 01:47:31.424
I've been meaning to tell you
I'm terminating your position.

01:47:32.525 --> 01:47:34.894
Okay, so while you were
on paternity leave,

01:47:34.928 --> 01:47:37.764
we were digging through your hard
drive, part of section B2A,

01:47:37.797 --> 01:47:41.835
and we found a lot
of interesting things.

01:47:42.836 --> 01:47:45.572
And I didn't know you
were into that stuff.

01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:49.576
This is really great.
The composition.

01:47:50.476 --> 01:47:53.713
I like the color balance, I like how the
greens are working with the blues here.

01:47:53.746 --> 01:47:55.915
So we want it to feel like
it's freshly picked.

01:47:55.949 --> 01:47:58.885
We also want to make it feel
like anyone can eat it.

01:47:58.918 --> 01:48:00.753
- That's great. Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

01:48:02.422 --> 01:48:04.958
Alright. How's it
going down there?

01:48:04.991 --> 01:48:07.994
- Good.
- Good. I'm gonna check real quick how it's lined up.

01:48:08.027 --> 01:48:11.431
Yeah. I think
the blueberry trail looks great.

01:48:11.464 --> 01:48:12.899
Want to grab some more
carrots for us?

01:48:13.967 --> 01:48:15.101
Love the carrot corner.

01:48:15.134 --> 01:48:16.970
Cherries are looking great.

01:48:17.003 --> 01:48:19.472
- It's nice and fresh. I want to eat it all up.
- This is great!

01:48:19.505 --> 01:48:22.075
- For the present.
- Hey, you're in your element.

01:48:22.108 --> 01:48:24.911
- Alright, good job.
- Appreciate it.

01:48:25.511 --> 01:48:28.114
Alright, team, I think we're
almost ready. What do you think?

01:48:28.147 --> 01:48:30.917
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Alright. Everyone ready?

01:48:31.484 --> 01:48:35.088
- It looks nice. Beautiful. Everyone feel good?
- Yeah.

01:48:35.121 --> 01:48:36.890
Let's do it. I'm gonna try one.

01:48:37.457 --> 01:48:38.524
Everyone lean back.

01:48:39.859 --> 01:48:43.997
Got one. Got one. Awesome, team.

01:48:50.770 --> 01:48:53.439
No, no, no, no, please!

01:48:53.473 --> 01:48:57.510
I was just... I was... I was just
at the... at the grocery store.

01:48:57.543 --> 01:49:01.848
My grandma, she's so sick and I had to...
she loves baguettes, so...

01:49:03.917 --> 01:49:05.084
Thank you.

01:49:06.486 --> 01:49:07.553
Thank you!

01:49:09.923 --> 01:49:10.990
Come on, one more!

01:49:11.024 --> 01:49:13.559
You want to look good
in your profile pics or not?

01:49:16.963 --> 01:49:19.966
Actually, I deleted
all my profiles.

01:49:19.999 --> 01:49:21.501
What, did you meet someone?

01:49:22.101 --> 01:49:24.003
Let me guess, 25, actress.

01:49:24.037 --> 01:49:26.472
She's 39, single mom.

01:49:26.506 --> 01:49:28.975
- Really?
- No, not really.

01:49:29.008 --> 01:49:30.977
I told you, man,
I don't want kids.

01:49:31.010 --> 01:49:33.012
And I'm not
ashamed about it anymore either.

01:49:33.046 --> 01:49:35.014
I even got rid of all those
photos in the office.

01:49:35.048 --> 01:49:36.916
The ones of your sister?

01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:40.153
Yeah. My patients will just have
to get used to it.

01:49:40.987 --> 01:49:41.988
Yeah.

01:49:42.789 --> 01:49:45.558
She's 25, actress. She's hot.

01:49:45.591 --> 01:49:48.895
That's great. Let's go.
Next set. Come on.

01:49:48.928 --> 01:49:51.030
You both can get
some rest now, okay?

01:49:51.931 --> 01:49:54.200
See you in a little bit.
I'm gonna miss you.

01:49:58.004 --> 01:49:59.772
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:50:00.106 --> 01:50:02.809
That's it.
They'll be here soon.

01:50:07.313 --> 01:50:09.182
This is gonna be okay, right?

01:50:10.883 --> 01:50:14.287
Look, Don and Taylor have been here every day,
they've babysat, they know the routine.

01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:18.257
Okay, we're just nervous because this is the
first official trade off. It'll be okay.

01:50:18.291 --> 01:50:20.059
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:50:20.093 --> 01:50:21.928
- Just a week.
- Just a week.

01:50:21.961 --> 01:50:23.596
- Just a week.
- Just a week.

01:50:26.899 --> 01:50:28.534
Did you figure out what
you're gonna say?

01:50:41.814 --> 01:50:43.149
<i>We have something to tell you.</i>

01:50:44.083 --> 01:50:45.118
<i>We do too.</i>

01:50:45.918 --> 01:50:46.919
We'll go first.

01:50:48.254 --> 01:50:49.122
Okay.

01:50:49.155 --> 01:50:52.158
So I watched Sarah
go through everything,

01:50:52.191 --> 01:50:56.963
and it looked hard
and painful and stressful.

01:50:56.996 --> 01:51:01.901
And I never expected this,
but it made me want to experience it too.

01:51:01.934 --> 01:51:03.936
So we've been trying.

01:51:03.970 --> 01:51:05.571
And I couldn't get pregnant.

01:51:05.605 --> 01:51:08.274
Oh, Taylor, we are so sorry.

01:51:08.307 --> 01:51:13.112
So we went to the doctor
and my sperm count was low,

01:51:13.146 --> 01:51:15.248
like zero, shooting blanks.

01:51:16.349 --> 01:51:18.818
Okay. You want me to donate?

01:51:19.318 --> 01:51:21.154
No, no, no, no, God, no.

01:51:21.954 --> 01:51:23.189
It's completely reversible.

01:51:23.222 --> 01:51:26.793
It turns out Buff It Out had way
too much dimethylamine in it,

01:51:26.826 --> 01:51:29.328
my testosterone levels
were out of whack but...

01:51:29.362 --> 01:51:31.864
but I'm off it,
everything's back to normal.

01:51:31.898 --> 01:51:34.167
- That... that's great.
- That's good, yeah.

01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:36.202
But here's the thing.

01:51:37.303 --> 01:51:39.205
I've been on it for two years.

01:51:43.810 --> 01:51:45.111
Yeah, I don't understand.

01:51:47.847 --> 01:51:49.348
They're yours, Jeff.

01:52:02.328 --> 01:52:03.896
That one time.

01:52:06.265 --> 01:52:08.935
- I guess it is possible.
- I told you.

01:52:08.968 --> 01:52:09.969
I know.

01:52:11.337 --> 01:52:12.939
You got pregnant from pre-cum.

01:52:12.972 --> 01:52:14.340
- They are ours. They are ours!
- My God.

01:52:15.842 --> 01:52:17.210
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.

01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:19.812
They're pre-cum babies!

01:52:21.381 --> 01:52:25.184
Anyways, you guys inspired us
to have our own.

01:52:25.218 --> 01:52:30.323
I want to experience the miracle
of pregnancy and childbirth.

01:52:30.356 --> 01:52:34.327
But we made a pact with you and...
and we're not about to break that.

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.195
Unless you want us to.

01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:39.132
You'd be looking at four times
the baby you bargained for.

01:52:39.966 --> 01:52:42.902
Well, that's kind of what we
wanted to talk to you about. We...

01:52:42.935 --> 01:52:44.370
We don't really want
to share them.

01:52:45.304 --> 01:52:47.039
We... we figured.

01:52:47.807 --> 01:52:51.210
So, we're out
for the baby split,

01:52:52.178 --> 01:52:54.180
but you're totally
welcome to babysit.

01:52:59.352 --> 01:53:03.156
Yes.

01:53:19.939 --> 01:53:21.073
Uh-huh.

01:53:21.441 --> 01:53:23.843
Yeah. Oh my God.

01:53:23.876 --> 01:53:25.244
Great. Just great.

01:53:25.278 --> 01:53:28.014
Oh, wait, there's one more.

01:53:28.382 --> 01:53:29.315
Okay.

01:53:29.348 --> 01:53:30.349
That's a good one.

01:53:31.150 --> 01:53:32.885
- Okay.
- How cute is that?

01:53:32.919 --> 01:53:36.022
Oh, very, very, very cute.

01:53:36.055 --> 01:53:38.090
But really, congratulations.

01:53:38.124 --> 01:53:40.793
So how's it been coming
with the reframing?

01:53:40.826 --> 01:53:44.030
When you picture the whole
process from beginning to end...

01:53:44.063 --> 01:53:44.964
Okay.

01:53:45.965 --> 01:53:47.133
What do you see?

01:54:14.994 --> 01:54:16.195
It's pretty good.

01:54:19.265 --> 01:54:21.234
But I think I need to keep
seeing you for now.

01:54:22.301 --> 01:54:23.803
Okay.

01:54:40.353 --> 01:54:41.287
What are you doing?

01:54:42.054 --> 01:54:43.256
Getting a condom.

01:54:45.057 --> 01:54:46.859
You got a new box, right?

01:54:47.827 --> 01:54:48.361
Yeah.

01:54:51.030 --> 01:54:52.231
Are you sure we need one?

01:54:58.237 --> 01:54:59.138
We do.

01:54:59.171 --> 01:55:00.206
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:55:00.239 --> 01:55:01.240
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:56:18.084 --> 01:56:23.222
I'm here in downtown Santa Monica at the
now defunct Boob Williams Massage Center

01:56:23.255 --> 01:56:28.327
<i>where residents are shocked to find
that CEO Cicero Jones is being arrested</i>

01:56:28.361 --> 01:56:31.364
on 17 counts
of alleged sexual assault.

01:56:31.398 --> 01:56:33.366
Back to you
in the newsroom.

01:56:34.367 --> 01:56:36.235
Sorry, what do they do again?

01:56:36.268 --> 01:56:38.104
They have an implant
massage center.

01:56:38.137 --> 01:56:41.307
An implant...
that's a terrible idea.

02:00:02.245 --> 02:00:07.245
