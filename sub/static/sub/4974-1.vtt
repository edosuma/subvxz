00:59.017 --> 01:02.103
America is an irradiated wasteland.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.815
Within it lies a city.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.695
Outside the boundary walls a desert.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.739
A cursed earth.

01:14.241 --> 01:17.577
Inside the walls a cursed city,

01:17.828 --> 01:21.164
stretching from Boston to Washington, D.C.

01:22.332 --> 01:25.001
An unbroken concrete landscape.

01:26.754 --> 01:31.174
800 million people
living in the ruin of the old world

01:31.842 --> 01:34.510
and the mega structures of the new one.

01:36.847 --> 01:40.183
Mega blocks. Mega highways.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.519
Mega City One.

01:52.279 --> 01:55.364
Convulsing. Choking.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.369
Breaking under its own weight.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.210
Citizens in fear of the street.

02:07.711 --> 02:11.380
The gun. The gang.

02:15.761 --> 02:19.096
Only one thing
fighting for order in the chaos,

02:20.390 --> 02:23.226
the men and women of the Hall of Justice.

02:27.523 --> 02:28.898
Juries.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.568
Executioners.

02:35.364 --> 02:36.405
Judges.

02:45.749 --> 02:50.253
Responders needed at a square at 1117.
Code 10-10.

02:50.379 --> 02:52.380
Leisure complex. Shots fired.

02:52.464 --> 02:55.466
Out of vehicle, in pursuit.
Request aerial surveillance.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.886
I have a control drone
flagging three perps.

02:59.263 --> 03:02.223
Responders needed
in Sub-Sector 20, Flyover 5.

03:02.307 --> 03:05.935
We have a positive ID on
three suspects wanted on multiple counts.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.603
Any Judges, please respond.

03:09.356 --> 03:13.860
Dredd to Control.
In pursuit of vehicle, Sector 13.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.949
Driving erratic. Suspects are
under the influence of narcotics.

03:42.931 --> 03:47.101
Got a Judge on our tail.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.770
What?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.647
I said we got a Judge on our tail!

03:51.773 --> 03:54.150
Take him out or we're dead fucking meat!

03:56.653 --> 03:57.778
Fuck!

03:59.448 --> 04:00.781
Do you require backup?

04:00.991 --> 04:01.991
No.

04:05.287 --> 04:06.746
Fucker!

04:12.294 --> 04:14.754
I can't get him! Straighten the fuck out!

04:29.102 --> 04:31.354
Be advised. We have lost visual.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.903
Fuck, he's right on us!

04:39.404 --> 04:42.573
Man, we're dead. We're fucking dead!

04:54.211 --> 04:58.547
Control. Perps just wiped out an innocent.
I'm taking them down.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.111
Bike. Activate crowd control.

05:20.237 --> 05:24.740
Activated. Citizens, be calm.
Step back from the crime scene.

05:24.908 --> 05:29.870
Interference carries an automatic
five-year sentence in the iso-cubes.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.216
Hey, fucking get out of here!

06:02.362 --> 06:07.033
Control. Paramedics to my GPS.
Multiple wounded and bodies for resyk.

06:07.451 --> 06:09.118
Copy, Dredd.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.874
All shoppers are reminded to avoid the
level one food courts until further notice.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.961
- Alternative refreshments can be found...
- Shut the fuck up.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.857
- Let's talk.
- Talk about what, Judge?

06:41.234 --> 06:43.652
Release the hostage unharmed,

06:43.820 --> 06:48.491
and I guarantee you a sentence of life
in an iso-cube without parole.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.702
Life without parole?
That's the deal you're offering?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.579
Only if you comply.

06:54.164 --> 06:59.001
Your crimes include multiple homicide
and the attempted murder of a Judge.

06:59.086 --> 07:03.047
If you do not comply,
the sentence is death.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.424
You aren't a very good negotiator, Judge.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.760
You know why?
You got no fucking leverage!

07:08.553 --> 07:12.598
Here's the deal. You let me walk
or I blow her fucking brains out. Okay?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.228
Negotiation's over.

07:17.354 --> 07:18.771
What are you doing?

07:18.855 --> 07:21.607
Didn't you hear what I said?
I'll kill the bitch!

07:21.733 --> 07:23.567
Yeah, I heard you, hotshot.

07:23.652 --> 07:24.610
What?

07:24.694 --> 07:26.695
I said "hotshot."

07:50.929 --> 07:52.930
Control to Dredd. Come in.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.267
- Is your pursuit resolved?
- Affirmative.

07:56.393 --> 08:00.479
Report back to the Hall of Justice.
The Chief Judge wants to see you.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.109
Thank you, Judge.

08:06.403 --> 08:10.906
The level one food court will reopen in
30 minutes. Thank you for your patience.

08:26.089 --> 08:28.424
Cassandra Anderson. Twenty-one.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.845
Born in a block 100 meters
from the radiation boundary wall.

08:32.971 --> 08:37.015
At age seven, she lost both parents
to residual-fallout cancer.

08:37.142 --> 08:41.937
As is usual with orphans, she was given
a Judge aptitude test at age nine.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.938
It classified her as unsuitable,

08:44.024 --> 08:47.443
but she was entered into the Academy
on special instruction.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.322
In the Academy, her record was never
better than borderline.

08:51.448 --> 08:55.618
Her final Academy score put her three
percentile points below a pass.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.953
So what's she doing in a uniform?

09:03.335 --> 09:05.002
- Rookie Anderson.
- Sir.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.004
How many people are observing you?

09:10.508 --> 09:11.634
Two.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.803
What can you tell me
about the person I'm with?

09:16.139 --> 09:19.433
Male. Another Judge.

09:21.144 --> 09:26.023
I can feel anger. And control. But

09:27.817 --> 09:29.652
there's something else.

09:29.778 --> 09:33.280
Something behind the control. Something

09:34.783 --> 09:37.451
- almost...
- Okay, Anderson.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.286
That will do.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.455
She's a mutant.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.710
The Judges Council have chosen to
overlook her status. So you will, too.

09:46.836 --> 09:51.048
She's the most powerful psychic
we've ever come across by a huge margin.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.051
The Judges are losing the war for the city.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.845
We believe she could be a major asset.

09:56.972 --> 10:01.350
As I said, her final score was only
three points below a pass. It's marginal.

10:01.476 --> 10:05.813
- It's not marginal. She failed.
- The girl's getting one more chance.

10:07.065 --> 10:11.527
I want you to take her out, give her
one day in the field. Supervised.

10:11.695 --> 10:13.737
See if she makes the grade.

10:13.863 --> 10:17.199
Sink or swim. Chuck her in the deep end.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.537
It's all the deep end.

10:23.206 --> 10:26.250
Personnel are required
to carry identification at all times.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.420
A rookie Judge on assessment
is likely to be involved in armed combat.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.547
One in five don't survive the first day.

10:31.673 --> 10:35.592
You may be required to carry out
on-the-spot executions of convicted felons.

10:35.677 --> 10:36.677
Yes, sir.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.305
Incorrect sentencing is an automatic fail.

10:39.389 --> 10:43.892
Disobeying a direct order from your
assessment officer is an automatic fail.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.980
Losing your primary weapon or having it
taken from you is an automatic fail.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.106
Yes, sir.

10:49.190 --> 10:52.276
- Are you ready, rookie?
- I am.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.069
Mandatory vehicle checks...

10:54.195 --> 10:56.196
Your assessment starts now.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.158
Ma.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.670
We got trouble.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.345
They were selling Sternhammer product
on my level.

12:43.805 --> 12:47.474
I warned them off with a beating a couple
of weeks ago. Guess it didn't work.

12:47.600 --> 12:51.103
- You can't deal with it yourself?
- I can deal with it.

12:51.354 --> 12:55.023
The question is whether you
wanna make an example of them.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.946
Skin them. Toss them over the balcony.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.449
Hit them with a little Slo-Mo first?

13:04.784 --> 13:05.784
Sure.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.543
Eat this, fucker!

13:15.003 --> 13:16.336
Hold him down!

13:17.297 --> 13:19.298
Please. Please.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.383
Please.

14:03.343 --> 14:07.554
Responders in the vicinity of Peach Trees.
We have a report of a triple homicide.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.350
The paramedic is on site
and is cordoning off the area.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.110
Twelve serious crimes
reported every minute.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.112
17,000 per day.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.282
- We can respond to around 6%.
- Which 6%?

14:28.117 --> 14:31.119
Your show, rookie. You tell me.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.872
Peach Trees. Multiple homicide.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.625
Dredd to Control. We'll take Peach Trees.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.210
Copy that.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.485
Hey, Joey, show us what you've got.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.243
Okay, rookie.
What do you know about Peach Trees?

15:11.327 --> 15:14.663
Sir. Peach Trees houses
75,000 registered citizens.

15:14.789 --> 15:18.792
It has the highest crime rate in Sector 13.
Unemployment rate of 96%.

15:18.918 --> 15:23.005
And more than half the residential levels
here are classed as slums.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.426
Rookie.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.761
Judgment.

15:29.846 --> 15:33.181
Vagrancy, three weeks, iso-cubes.
But prioritize murders?

15:33.349 --> 15:36.101
Correct. Don't be here when we get back.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.020
Yes. Thanks, Judge.

15:39.856 --> 15:42.524
Please remain behind the security tape.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.527
So why do you wanna be a Judge?

15:45.695 --> 15:49.865
Sir. I want to protect and serve the city.
To make a difference.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.367
Make a difference to a block like this?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.703
It's yours if you want it.

15:54.996 --> 15:59.207
I was born and raised in a block like this
before the Justice Department took me.

15:59.292 --> 16:04.296
I know there are good people inside,
good families just trying to get by.

16:05.715 --> 16:08.383
Yes, I believe I can make a difference.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.511
Admirable.

16:12.805 --> 16:17.142
The mall will be closing today at 10 o'clock.
Plenty of time to make your purchases.

16:19.729 --> 16:20.729
What have you got?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.732
Three stiffs in a somewhat
fucked-up condition.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.069
Did you get a picture of that?

16:27.236 --> 16:30.322
- You based in Peach Trees?
- Med Center, level 25.

16:30.406 --> 16:32.157
- You ID'd them?
- Mostly.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.802
These two are registered to this block.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.827
- And him?
- I'll have to run his blood

16:35.912 --> 16:37.245
through a DNA profiler.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.915
If I can figure out which blood is his.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.674
What do you make of this, rookie?

16:49.842 --> 16:51.677
I don't know, sir.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.184
It's a cold-burn from a Slo-Mo inhaler.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.602
Slo-Mo?

17:00.853 --> 17:04.189
Only just hit the grid,
but it's making big waves.

17:04.272 --> 17:08.109
Makes the brain feel as if
time is passing at 1 % its normal speed.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.114
Guess it felt like a long way down.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.463
Positive on your IDs.

17:28.631 --> 17:33.135
All showing convictions for possession
of narcotics. Transmitting data now.

17:34.804 --> 17:39.474
Small-time perps. Junkies. No known
gang affiliation. What's your analysis?

17:41.144 --> 17:44.062
Drugged. Skinned. Displayed in public.

17:44.188 --> 17:48.024
I think it's a punishment killing.
Someone's trying to send a message.

17:48.151 --> 17:51.486
Yeah. Don't fuck with the Ma-Ma clan.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.406
Ma-Ma clan?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.829
We have her on record
from her whoring days.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.873
The picture's pretty old,

18:02.999 --> 18:07.586
but that's her.
Madeline Madrigal, aka Ma-Ma.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.256
Ex-hooker from the S-9 pleasure district.

18:11.382 --> 18:15.886
Quit working when she got sliced up
by a pimp. She got her own back.

18:16.012 --> 18:19.473
Block legend says she's feminized
the guy with her teeth.

18:19.599 --> 18:23.351
Took over his business interests
and never looked back.

18:23.811 --> 18:26.646
Anyone else,
you'd say it was bullshit, right?

18:27.231 --> 18:30.567
Not with Ma-Ma. Her trademark is violence.

18:34.530 --> 18:39.618
Not so long ago, there were three main
gangs hustling for control of Peach Trees.

18:40.161 --> 18:43.914
The Peyote Kings,
the Red Dragons, the Judged.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.625
Then Ma-Ma arrived.

18:52.590 --> 18:53.632
What the fuck?

18:55.426 --> 18:56.927
Let's go!

18:58.346 --> 19:02.349
Took over the top floor of the block
and started working her way down.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.978
Nine months later,
she had control of everything.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.523
Levels one to 200

19:10.191 --> 19:11.525
are hers.

19:12.443 --> 19:13.777
How did she get away with it?

19:13.861 --> 19:17.113
You know how often
we get a Judge up in Peach Trees?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.991
Well, you got one now.

19:20.952 --> 19:24.788
The victims are registered
to apartments on level 39.

19:24.914 --> 19:29.459
Likely killed over a turf issue,
so perps will be in the vicinity.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.503
Rookie.

19:32.255 --> 19:36.258
Find out where the clan operate
on this level, and hit it hard.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.054
That would be here.

20:49.832 --> 20:52.125
I take it this is your first time
in non-sim combat.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.668
Yes, sir.

20:53.753 --> 20:57.005
Been wondering when you'd remember
you left your helmet behind.

20:57.131 --> 21:00.467
Sir, a helmet can interfere
with my psychic abilities.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.179
Think a bullet
might interfere with them more.

21:15.650 --> 21:18.068
- Are you ready?
- Yes, sir.

21:19.737 --> 21:23.323
- You don't look ready.
- Just adrenaline, sir.

22:41.569 --> 22:42.652
Rookie.

22:44.238 --> 22:46.573
Anderson. Judgment.

22:46.866 --> 22:51.870
Crime, possession and use of controlled
substances. Sentence, two years iso-cubes.

22:52.329 --> 22:55.248
No, don't tell me. Tell Control.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.334
- Anderson to Control.
- Copy.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.713
Requesting meat wagon to Peach Trees,
level 39. We have

23:02.131 --> 23:05.675
four bodies for resyk
and eight live for the iso-cubes.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.428
Copy that. Meat wagon inbound.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.930
All right. Let's get them cuffed.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.057
Move. Up.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.566
Sir, this one's a gang member. He...

23:28.491 --> 23:30.033
Sir, it's him.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.785
Him who?

23:31.911 --> 23:34.788
The man who murdered the people
in the atrium.

23:35.790 --> 23:37.040
You're sure?

23:39.668 --> 23:41.419
99%.

23:44.048 --> 23:47.133
Can't execute a perp on 99%.

23:51.222 --> 23:55.391
Save me a lot of paperwork
if you just confess right now.

23:58.395 --> 24:04.067
We'll take him in. See how he holds up
after a few hours of interrogation.

24:30.219 --> 24:31.427
Shit.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.890
Judges. No, no, no, no.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.689
Caleb? There's a problem on level 39.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.150
Judges hit the distribution point
and shot the place up.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.442
Took out a few of the boys.

24:46.569 --> 24:48.361
So what? We're overdue a bust.

24:48.487 --> 24:51.281
It's just the Judges showing their faces,
reminding the citizens they exist.

24:51.365 --> 24:54.325
- No, Ma. They picked up Kay.
- Executed?

24:54.410 --> 24:57.078
Interrogation.
They're taking him in right now.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.204
Fuck.

24:58.372 --> 25:02.000
- If Kay talks...
- If they're taking him in, he'll talk.

25:04.545 --> 25:06.296
What are we gonna do?

25:37.536 --> 25:39.454
That one's still breathing.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.334
Control room is secure.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.177
Router's in. You're good to go.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.681
Sector Control.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.392
Sector Control, this is
Peach Trees Control,

26:01.477 --> 26:05.063
I just wanna check you were notified about
the def-con systems test today.

26:05.147 --> 26:08.900
Copy that. Peach Trees,
we don't have you down for a def-con test.

26:08.984 --> 26:12.403
- Yeah, we must be. If you check the...
- I've got nothing.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.991
God fucking damn it, Sector!

26:17.076 --> 26:20.411
I put in the notification
myself three fucking times!

26:20.537 --> 26:21.788
We are good to go right now!

26:21.872 --> 26:24.999
I've got my supervisor
breathing down my neck.

26:25.167 --> 26:28.002
Hold fire, Peach Trees. Let me get on this.

26:28.379 --> 26:30.546
Okay. I put you on the system.

26:30.673 --> 26:34.509
Hall of Justice and all emergency services
are notified to ignore your status.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.803
You can run the test any time you like.

26:36.887 --> 26:40.974
Appreciate that, Sector.
You just saved my ass over here.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.017
You're welcome, Peach Trees.

26:52.486 --> 26:55.697
Sir, he's thinking about
making a move for your gun.

26:55.823 --> 26:56.823
Yeah.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.159
He just changed his mind.

27:00.536 --> 27:01.536
Yeah.

27:06.542 --> 27:10.044
Then enter the pass key
and you should be inside.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.549
Security protocols accessed.

27:15.843 --> 27:17.885
War protocol accessed.

27:19.096 --> 27:20.888
Blast shield initiated.

27:26.562 --> 27:29.355
Warned you. Get up.
You're headed for the cubes.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.733
Stand clear of doors.

27:34.236 --> 27:42.236
All residents remain calm.

28:17.279 --> 28:18.696
What's going on?

28:27.456 --> 28:29.540
Lockdown complete.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.805
You're patched in.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.072
Peach Trees.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.991
This is Ma-Ma.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.831
Somewhere in this block are two Judges.

29:12.251 --> 29:13.918
I want them dead.

29:15.671 --> 29:18.673
Until I get what I want,
the block is locked down.

29:20.801 --> 29:25.138
All clan, every level,
hunt the Judges down.

29:26.348 --> 29:28.182
Everyone else, clear the corridors

29:28.308 --> 29:30.852
and stay the fuck out of our way
until the shooting stops.

29:34.523 --> 29:36.315
If I hear of anyone helping the Judges,

29:36.400 --> 29:40.194
I will kill them
and the next generation of their family.

29:46.452 --> 29:48.327
As for the Judges...

29:48.412 --> 29:50.163
We better move.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.582
Sit tight, or run.

29:56.378 --> 29:58.671
Makes no difference. You're mine.

30:17.900 --> 30:22.028
Control, we have a situation developing
in Peach Trees. Do you copy?

30:23.363 --> 30:26.741
- Control, do you copy?
- My comms are down, too.

30:26.909 --> 30:28.951
Shielding must be blocking
our transmissions.

30:29.620 --> 30:32.079
We'll head for the Med Center.

30:36.418 --> 30:37.793
They're here!

30:39.421 --> 30:40.880
- Call it.
- Sir?

30:40.964 --> 30:42.798
You're on assessment, rookie. Call it.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.552
Multiple armed targets.
Obstructed line of sight. Gas grenades.

30:46.637 --> 30:47.970
Respirators.

30:48.722 --> 30:51.098
Advise you hold your breath.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.494
I want the north and east corridor
totally covered.

31:53.620 --> 31:57.665
Sal's got the west and the south.
And spread out your hardware.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.835
We're gonna hand these Judges
back to Ma-Ma on a plate.

32:05.215 --> 32:08.968
- Stay fucking focused.
- Judges got it coming!

32:21.023 --> 32:24.692
- Judge, come and get me.
- We're gonna have to go through them.

32:26.069 --> 32:27.695
Stun grenade.

32:31.700 --> 32:35.953
- Kill that motherfucker.
- Let's give them the good news.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.420
- Man up that corridor, man.
- Fuck up the Judges.

32:44.546 --> 32:45.880
Fuck them.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.717
Citizens of Peach Trees. This is the law.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.719
Who do you think you are
coming up in here?

32:52.137 --> 32:56.557
Disperse immediately, or we will use
lethal force to clear the area.

32:56.642 --> 33:00.394
- Where's that coming from?
- Over there. Access corridor.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.563
You have been warned.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.942
You now have 20 seconds to comply.

33:07.069 --> 33:11.739
It's you doing the complying, Judge.
There's 10 of us, only two of you.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.492
Why don't you step out
from behind that doorway,

33:14.576 --> 33:15.951
or we're gonna blow the fuck out of you.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.745
Ten seconds to comply.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.289
- Fuck you, Judge.
- You got five.

33:21.124 --> 33:23.084
Thanks for the heads-up.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.604
Please.

33:44.815 --> 33:46.816
What are you waiting for, rookie?

33:46.942 --> 33:51.278
His crime is attempted murder of a Judge.
His sentence is death.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.782
Yes, sir.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.935
Open up.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.981
- Open up!
- Negative, Judge.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.108
You know what's going on out here.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.775
We need a place we can defend.

34:30.860 --> 34:34.697
Then you better find someplace else.
This is a medical facility. Neutral ground.

34:34.822 --> 34:38.659
Neutral? You're not neutral.
You're choosing sides.

34:38.784 --> 34:42.121
Peach Trees has been sealed by
blast doors designed to withstand attack.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.790
No one's getting out. No one's coming in.

34:44.875 --> 34:48.835
And you have every clan affiliate
in the block after your blood.

34:49.004 --> 34:52.339
There are no sides. You're already dead.

35:12.527 --> 35:15.196
Looks like the Med Center's
closed early today.

35:15.697 --> 35:20.367
Switch weapon to silencer mode.
Our best bet now is to go covert.

35:20.494 --> 35:24.330
Conserve ammunition.
And don't shoot unless you're gonna hit.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.794
- Sir, what about the prisoner?
- Explain.

35:30.212 --> 35:33.047
Under the circumstances,
he could be a liability.

35:33.215 --> 35:36.550
Also a prime suspect in three homicides.

35:37.385 --> 35:41.138
What do you say, rookie?
Wanna cut him loose?

35:42.057 --> 35:43.557
No, sir.

35:55.362 --> 35:56.695
Get up!

36:16.925 --> 36:18.759
Go, go, go, go!

36:38.363 --> 36:39.697
Hold up.

36:54.087 --> 36:57.047
- Move!
- Keep your eyes peeled.

36:57.173 --> 36:59.592
Man, stop telling me what to fucking do!

37:09.936 --> 37:11.854
I know that new shit...

37:19.529 --> 37:20.529
Cathy?

37:21.531 --> 37:24.450
- Who's there?
- Cathy, open the door.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.958
We're not gonna hurt you.

37:47.474 --> 37:48.474
Clear.

37:49.684 --> 37:53.228
Secure the woman somewhere
she can't raise any alarms.

37:53.355 --> 37:54.939
We can't.

37:55.815 --> 37:59.818
She has a baby. Asleep in the next room.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.237
We can't secure her if we don't know
when she'll be freed.

38:02.364 --> 38:03.864
Is there a father?

38:04.407 --> 38:07.493
He's out there. Looking for us.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.538
Say that. What you were just thinking.

38:11.665 --> 38:15.501
- How did you...
- It's okay. Go ahead.

38:18.088 --> 38:20.089
I'm not raising any alarms.

38:20.548 --> 38:23.926
If the men out there don't know where
you are, you won't be killing them.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.469
Go on.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.515
There's a service elevator near here.

38:29.641 --> 38:32.309
The sign says it's broken, but

38:35.271 --> 38:39.274
it works as long as you're hitting
a button above level 75.

38:39.484 --> 38:42.820
I just want you off my level.
Away from my family.

39:15.061 --> 39:16.645
- Cathy, I...
- Don't thank me.

39:17.564 --> 39:21.692
It's not for you.
I just don't wanna see you again.

39:25.447 --> 39:27.031
You won't.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.271
This drug shifts like
nothing I've ever seen.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.399
If we play this right,
we could take the whole fucking city.

40:02.859 --> 40:06.028
The only danger is we expand too fast.

40:06.488 --> 40:09.573
In the last few days, we've added
distribution to three new blocks.

40:09.908 --> 40:13.577
And pretty soon, we're looking at
making inroads into Sectors 9 and 15.

40:13.703 --> 40:16.121
Fifteen is still Red territory.

40:16.206 --> 40:17.331
Ma.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.917
You better come quick.

40:21.169 --> 40:26.131
Okay. We got one here,
maybe 11 outside the Med Center.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.510
There's eight in the stairwell
and another five on level 18.

40:29.636 --> 40:33.514
They've downed 30 plus
and haven't even taken a scratch.

40:33.640 --> 40:34.640
Where are they now?

40:34.724 --> 40:37.726
I don't know, but they seem
to be moving their way up the block.

40:37.852 --> 40:41.605
No, wait, wait. I just picked them up.
They're on level 76, west quadrant.

40:41.731 --> 40:43.273
Do you want me to patch you back
into the PA?

40:43.358 --> 40:46.401
We could get level 60 through 80
converging on them.

40:46.528 --> 40:48.779
No. Can you seal them in there?

40:48.905 --> 40:53.325
Sure. War override gives me
total control of the building.

41:14.055 --> 41:15.681
That's not good.

41:16.099 --> 41:18.767
Full lockdown. They're going nowhere.

41:19.978 --> 41:24.022
I tried to do this clean, but they wouldn't
let me. So now we do it messy.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.151
Too late, Judge.

41:31.614 --> 41:33.323
Caleb, come in.

41:33.449 --> 41:34.449
Ma.

41:35.785 --> 41:39.204
We've got them cornered.
We're taking them down right now.

41:46.087 --> 41:48.630
We'd need oxyacetylene to cut through.

41:48.840 --> 41:52.676
They know where we are.
Why aren't they coming after us?

41:52.802 --> 41:54.803
That's what worries me.

41:58.850 --> 42:03.520
Take him back to the main lobby.
Hold position behind the elevator shaft.

42:03.646 --> 42:06.064
Be a good place to defend.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.775
Where are you going?

42:09.027 --> 42:12.487
If I don't come back, and you get cornered,

42:13.281 --> 42:15.949
you might not wanna get taken alive.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.870
Your call.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.371
Sir.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.696
Get away from the door!

43:04.248 --> 43:05.582
Sit down!

43:25.812 --> 43:27.562
He's right, you know.

43:29.065 --> 43:32.401
About not wanting to be taken alive.

43:33.236 --> 43:36.321
The stuff the clan
would do to a girl like you...

43:39.117 --> 43:40.117
Nasty.

43:51.671 --> 43:55.674
We had a girl one time,
girl about your age and...

44:00.930 --> 44:02.681
Well, anyway...

44:04.308 --> 44:07.519
I'm just saying,
save the last bullet for yourself.

44:07.645 --> 44:10.313
Yeah, and I'll save
the second to last one for you.

44:10.440 --> 44:11.440
Sure.

44:15.528 --> 44:17.362
So you're a mutant?

44:18.239 --> 44:22.492
Most of you poor fuckers
got three stumpy arms, or no arms.

44:23.578 --> 44:28.665
But I guess you lucked out.
You fit together pretty well.

44:33.588 --> 44:37.424
Psychic. So fucked up.

44:39.260 --> 44:41.428
Yeah, I heard about your kind.

44:42.263 --> 44:44.598
Kind of hard to believe it's real.

44:47.393 --> 44:49.770
Like what am I thinking about right now?

44:55.610 --> 44:58.862
You're picturing a violent sexual liaison
between the two of us

44:58.946 --> 45:01.239
in a pointless attempt to shock me.

45:03.367 --> 45:06.036
You're good.
But I wasn't trying to shock you.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.830
If I was trying to shock you,
I'd have been thinking about this.

45:10.833 --> 45:13.293
What are you thinking about now?

45:30.144 --> 45:32.771
- What the fuck was that?
- Get back inside.

45:36.442 --> 45:38.110
Hurry the fuck up.

45:38.986 --> 45:40.987
Move your fucking asses.

46:00.466 --> 46:02.300
Move! Move!

46:05.513 --> 46:09.516
Back in the house. Get in the house, now!

46:13.521 --> 46:14.604
Shit!

46:15.022 --> 46:16.189
Fire!

46:26.033 --> 46:28.410
Frank! Frankie! Let's go!

46:59.066 --> 47:00.108
Move.

47:27.220 --> 47:28.637
Get back!

47:36.145 --> 47:37.395
Concentrate the fire.

47:51.327 --> 47:52.744
High ex!

47:55.206 --> 47:56.206
Move!

49:07.194 --> 49:09.529
There's no way they survived.

49:10.656 --> 49:13.325
They're not dead till we find them dead.

49:16.871 --> 49:18.872
Or part of them anyway.

49:34.764 --> 49:36.514
Comms are back on.

49:37.725 --> 49:39.726
Control. Do you copy?

49:39.852 --> 49:40.935
Affirmative.

49:41.062 --> 49:45.190
10-24 on my GPS.
Request immediate assistance.

49:45.316 --> 49:48.193
Copy, 10-24. Judges under fire.

49:48.319 --> 49:52.447
Showing your location as Peach Trees,
Sector 13. Confirm.

49:52.573 --> 49:56.826
Confirm. Be advised,
blast door defenses have been triggered.

49:57.661 --> 50:00.246
Can you hold your current GPS?

50:03.167 --> 50:04.501
Negative.

50:05.586 --> 50:08.213
If they come for us,
we've got nowhere to go.

50:08.339 --> 50:12.342
Copy that. Backup is on its way.
Just stay alive.

50:14.470 --> 50:16.388
We gotta go back in.

50:47.795 --> 50:50.547
God damn it, man! What the fuck?

50:53.592 --> 50:55.176
No! No, no!

51:28.544 --> 51:31.212
Your gang locks down a whole block.

51:32.173 --> 51:35.383
Massacres an entire quadrant of men,
women and children,

51:35.468 --> 51:37.343
just to take out two Judges.

51:37.970 --> 51:40.221
Sound like overkill to you?

51:52.776 --> 51:55.111
I'll tell you what I think.

51:55.237 --> 51:59.365
I think if we'd executed you at the bust,
Ma-Ma would have let us walk out of here.

52:02.536 --> 52:06.247
What she doesn't want
is you taken back to the Sector house.

52:06.373 --> 52:11.044
She doesn't want you interrogated.
She's afraid of what you might say.

52:11.420 --> 52:13.755
And that's got me curious.

52:16.884 --> 52:19.219
- Spill it!
- Fuck you!

52:23.891 --> 52:24.891
Sir.

52:26.393 --> 52:27.393
Sir!

52:28.562 --> 52:31.564
If you leave it to me,
he doesn't have to speak.

52:46.747 --> 52:49.749
What are you up to, bitch?

52:53.504 --> 52:55.797
Welcome to the inside of your head.

52:58.592 --> 53:00.343
It's kind of empty in here.

53:01.095 --> 53:06.432
I don't know what kind of mutant shit this
is, but if my hands weren't cuffed...

53:06.517 --> 53:09.769
You aren't cuffed, if you don't wanna be.

53:14.817 --> 53:17.026
My head. Do what I like?

53:17.111 --> 53:18.111
Sure.

53:22.283 --> 53:25.451
Thinking about hurting me
doesn't actually hurt me.

53:25.619 --> 53:28.454
Yeah. Points to you.

53:28.539 --> 53:31.874
Except there is that thing.

53:32.334 --> 53:33.793
What thing was that?

53:33.961 --> 53:36.462
That I know how to freak you the fuck out.

53:36.630 --> 53:39.674
See, if you're talking about
my fucked-up head

53:40.801 --> 53:43.177
versus your fucked-up head,

53:45.514 --> 53:47.640
your fucked-up head is gonna lose.

53:51.979 --> 53:54.022
I figured that would shut you up.

53:54.148 --> 53:56.983
Hey. I can play mind games, too.

53:59.361 --> 54:03.031
You fucking bitch! You sick fucking bitch!

54:03.157 --> 54:05.325
We haven't even started.

54:19.715 --> 54:21.049
Got it.

54:26.513 --> 54:31.017
Peach Trees is the manufacturing base
for all the Slo-Mo in Mega City One.

54:31.185 --> 54:35.688
Ma-Ma's controlling the production
and distribution across the whole city.

54:37.024 --> 54:38.358
Interesting.

54:49.662 --> 54:51.496
Peach Trees. Can I help you?

54:51.664 --> 54:54.582
We're responding to a report of Judges
under fire from within this block.

54:54.708 --> 54:57.543
Judges under fire?
I'm unaware of any such activity.

54:57.795 --> 55:00.254
We're actually undergoing
a scheduled war defense test.

55:00.339 --> 55:04.467
Not anymore, you're not.
Open the blast door right now.

55:04.718 --> 55:08.137
Yes, sir. The problem is
we've had a software malfunction

55:08.222 --> 55:10.139
and I've lost control of the system.

55:11.684 --> 55:13.976
We've had a fire on level 76.

55:18.232 --> 55:22.735
You better get control fast. Or I'm slapping
you with an obstruction of justice charge.

55:22.820 --> 55:25.488
Five years in the cubes, mandatory.

55:25.656 --> 55:28.616
Will do, sir. I'm on it right now.
Thank you.

55:37.292 --> 55:39.001
We have new intel about Ma-Ma,

55:39.086 --> 55:41.421
and we've managed
to get a 10-24 to Control.

55:41.588 --> 55:44.799
Parameters are shifting.
What are the options, Anderson?

55:44.925 --> 55:49.095
Keep moving and attempt to avoid further
detection, or find a place to defend.

55:49.179 --> 55:51.848
Same as before, except now
we know backup's inbound.

55:51.974 --> 55:54.642
You're giving us two options.
Defend or hide.

55:54.768 --> 55:56.102
Yes, sir.

55:56.770 --> 56:00.106
What about we attack?
Head straight for Ma-Ma.

56:00.274 --> 56:02.191
Is that an option?

56:02.317 --> 56:05.278
Well, she's guilty. We're Judges.

56:05.362 --> 56:09.866
Sir, with backup inbound, I think we should
wait until the odds have shifted in our favor.

56:12.369 --> 56:13.870
Wrong answer?

56:14.663 --> 56:16.664
You're the psychic.

56:27.634 --> 56:28.634
Clear.

56:38.771 --> 56:40.438
Why didn't you shoot him?

56:40.522 --> 56:43.858
What do you mean, why didn't I shoot him?
Why didn't you?

56:45.319 --> 56:46.819
- Okay, we could do it now.
- Do it.

56:46.904 --> 56:48.029
- No, you do it.
- You do it!

56:50.824 --> 56:52.617
Shit! Shit!

56:53.869 --> 56:56.287
Why did it have to be us who found him?

56:56.371 --> 56:58.831
All right. Come on. Come on.

57:03.712 --> 57:07.048
Info terminal. Let's check the schematics.

57:27.653 --> 57:29.487
Freeze!

57:33.867 --> 57:34.951
Why?

57:37.871 --> 57:39.372
Why what?

57:41.542 --> 57:43.543
Well, why should I freeze?

57:46.463 --> 57:49.298
Because otherwise I'll shoot you.

57:51.176 --> 57:52.343
With the safety on?

57:54.471 --> 57:55.471
It isn't.

58:01.895 --> 58:05.898
How do you want it, kids?
Body bags or juve-cubes?

58:06.066 --> 58:07.650
Makes no difference to me.

58:10.863 --> 58:12.363
Fuck!

58:15.325 --> 58:16.325
Stun!

58:39.766 --> 58:41.767
You are so fucked.

58:59.161 --> 59:00.995
- Blondie.
- Come on!

59:01.121 --> 59:02.997
Come on, you bitch.

59:13.926 --> 59:15.468
Hold that bitch down.

59:16.053 --> 59:17.136
Jesus.

59:17.262 --> 59:20.598
- Now then, what am I gonna do with you?
- You're going to do nothing.

59:24.645 --> 59:26.896
All this trouble is your doing.

59:27.397 --> 59:32.234
When you got busted, you should have
killed the Judges or been killed yourself.

59:33.153 --> 59:36.197
But instead you let yourself
get taken like the dumb fuck you are.

59:36.281 --> 59:37.281
But I...

59:40.118 --> 59:41.786
Shut the fuck up.

59:43.956 --> 59:48.626
I'd kill you myself, but I already lost
plenty today. I can't afford to lose more.

59:57.052 --> 01:00:00.388
Sooner or later, the Justice Department
is gonna come through the blast doors

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:02.556
looking for their Judges.

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:08.980
They'll find their bodies all shot up.
One on level 25,

01:00:10.148 --> 01:00:13.484
one in the Slo-Mo den.
Just a bust that went wrong.

01:00:14.695 --> 01:00:16.696
That means no torture.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:21.117
No raping, no skinning. Just a bunch
of bullets to the head and chest.

01:00:21.576 --> 01:00:23.327
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:26.163
- Do you fucking understand me?
- Yes.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.289
Ma.

01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:31.502
He's back.

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:45.266
It's the other Judge. He's patched himself
into one of the terminals.

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:48.769
- I think he's trying to access the PA.
- Can't you stop him?

01:00:48.854 --> 01:00:51.188
I can shut down the whole system,

01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:54.400
but if you let him talk,
I can trace which terminal he's using.

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.986
We'll know exactly where he is.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:12.334
Inhabitants of Peach Trees.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.046
This is Judge Dredd.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.549
Let him talk.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:22.094
In case you people have forgotten,

01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:26.932
this block operates under the same
rules as the rest of the city.

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:30.061
Ma-Ma is not the law.

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:32.438
I am the law.

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:35.983
Ma-Ma is a common criminal.

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:39.612
Guilty of murder.

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:45.117
Guilty of the manufacture and distribution
of the narcotic known as Slo-Mo.

01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:48.913
And as of now, under sentence of death.

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:52.583
Any who obstruct me
in carrying out my duty

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:55.503
will be treated
as an accessory to her crimes.

01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:58.798
You have been warned.

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:02.635
And as for you, Ma-Ma...

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:06.931
Judgment time.

01:02:10.102 --> 01:02:15.064
I got him. He's only 10 levels below us.
South quad balcony. Terminal 5.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.774
Motherfucker.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.631
Fucker still hasn't gone down.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.904
It's not him.

01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:09.368
Incendiary.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:50.451
How the fuck are we gonna stop this guy?

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:55.998
Call 911.

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:27.279
Got a 10-24 from this block.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:31.867
Two Judges under fire, requesting urgent
assistance and you're standing outside.

01:04:31.952 --> 01:04:35.621
Block's under lockdown.
Malfunction with their defense system.

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:43.170
Open up. Now!

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:51.387
You're relieved.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:07.861
So what have we got?

01:05:07.988 --> 01:05:11.323
Two Judges trigger a turf war.
Judges die in pursuit of duty.

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:14.410
- And the perps who killed the Judges?
- Laid out here.

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:16.245
- Sounds right.
- Excuse me.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:22.042
It's not what's happened.
I've been here from the start.

01:05:22.127 --> 01:05:25.004
This killing's all about one gang.
The Ma-Ma clan.

01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:26.839
And from the sound of gunfire,

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:29.800
I'd say at least one of your two Judges
is still alive.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:32.261
- Are you prepared to testify to that?
- Sure.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:59.705
One million credits.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.123
A million?

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.959
You have a problem with a Judge.
You know who he is?

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:05.336
No.

01:06:06.046 --> 01:06:08.130
I do. One million.

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:10.549
Fine.

01:06:10.759 --> 01:06:15.846
Kaplan, protection detail on client.
Chan, Alvarez, we're flushing him out.

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.639
You got it.

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:20.809
- Where's the other one? The rookie.
- We got her here.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:23.228
- Dead or alive?
- Alive.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:26.065
Make her dead.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:11.128
You, there. Identify yourself.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:15.924
- Chan. Sector 9.
- Dredd. Sector 13.

01:08:17.218 --> 01:08:19.720
Responding to your 10-24.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:26.810
Good to see you, Dredd.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:29.813
Likewise. You alone?

01:08:29.898 --> 01:08:33.649
Negative. Three-man squad.
Closing on my vector right now.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:36.403
So relax.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.238
Cavalry's here.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:41.700
Two.

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:43.785
Two?

01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:47.372
Two of us called in the 10-24.

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:51.460
Wondering why
you didn't ask about the other one.

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:54.712
Lex, move it!

01:09:02.221 --> 01:09:04.014
Choke on it, Dredd.

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:18.654
Choke on that.

01:09:34.254 --> 01:09:35.921
Shit!

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:02.614
Bet you thought you were gonna
make your family proud?

01:10:05.076 --> 01:10:07.077
Not much chance of that now.

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:12.082
Now this, I always wanted one of these.
This is...

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:18.630
You were shit out of luck when you ran into
the Ma-Ma clan. But don't feel too bad.

01:10:19.048 --> 01:10:23.969
I seen a lot of Judges in my time,
and you're just not cut out for this.

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:27.806
I mean, if you didn't get killed today,
it was gonna be tomorrow.

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:30.642
Or it was gonna be the day after that.

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:33.186
Anyway,

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.231
today it is.

01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:42.654
You got any last words, bitch?

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:48.869
That's funny.

01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:51.538
I was gonna ask you that.

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:53.498
Bitch.

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:42.214
Kay's dead.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:45.384
- Find somewhere to hide.
- Where are you going?

01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:48.887
I've got the girl cold.
I see her first, I shoot her.

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:53.016
She sees me first, she hesitates,
then I shoot her.

01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:29.571
What's the price of a Judge these days?

01:13:30.865 --> 01:13:32.199
Million.

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:39.247
Split four ways.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:46.004
Three ways now.

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:47.756
Suits me.

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:54.930
Doesn't sound like much.

01:13:57.975 --> 01:13:59.643
To betray the law.

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:08.151
Betray the city.

01:14:11.989 --> 01:14:14.366
Save that shit for the rookies.

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.702
Twenty years I've been on the streets.

01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:22.165
You know what Mega City One is, Dredd?

01:14:23.626 --> 01:14:25.919
It's a fucking meat grinder.

01:14:26.838 --> 01:14:28.630
People go in one end.

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:37.848
And meat comes out the other.

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:44.187
All we do

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:47.065
is turn the handle.

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:58.076
Rapid fire.

01:15:00.413 --> 01:15:02.205
Incendiary. Armor piercing.

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:04.916
High ex.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.339
Motherfucker.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:16.469
Two-way split.

01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:21.266
Yeah, I'd be breaking a sweat,
if you hadn't just run out of bullets.

01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:40.660
Lower your gun, rookie. I'm your backup.

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:03.516
Armor piercing.

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:40.470
Wait.

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:44.474
Wait?

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:49.020
Are you kidding me?
Did you just say "wait"?

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:53.650
Judge Dredd,

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.320
the Judge Dredd

01:16:58.155 --> 01:17:00.991
finally gets on the wrong end of a gun,

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:03.994
and what he says is "wait."

01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:09.332
You know what? I expected more of you.

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:14.170
I mean, wait for what?
Wait for me to change my mind?

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.181
Wait for another two or
three seconds of life

01:17:16.215 --> 01:17:19.426
because you're so fucking weak
you just can't stand to see it end?

01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:21.845
No.

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:31.730
Wait for her to shoot you.

01:17:37.236 --> 01:17:38.236
Okay.

01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:41.239
Basic field dressing.

01:18:02.053 --> 01:18:03.386
Reload.

01:18:11.270 --> 01:18:12.270
Ready?

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:13.730
Yeah.

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:15.899
You look ready.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:52.477
No, don't shoot! Please don't shoot me!

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:56.147
I'm not armed. I'm not armed.
I can help you.

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:57.273
How?

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:02.445
Ma-Ma's in her private quarters,
but it's behind 10 inches of steel.

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:06.908
So you can't get in there without the
keypad combination. I can give that to you.

01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:11.329
I don't need your cooperation
to get the combination from you.

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:15.166
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:25.301
Go.

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.221
Get out of here.

01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:35.979
Mind explaining yourself, rookie?

01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:39.274
Abetting a felon is not just a fail offense.
It's a crime.

01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:43.236
I already picked up the fail
when I lost my primary weapon.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.865
I'm not gonna be a Judge, and I don't need
to be a mind-reader to know it.

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:48.241
He's a victim, not a perp.

01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:52.287
And until my assessment is formally over,
I'm still entitled to dispense justice.

01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:55.623
And that's what I just
did by letting him go.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.585
Maybe that'll be
the one difference I do make.

01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:02.547
The code to Ma-Ma's chambers is 4-9-4-3-6.

01:20:02.673 --> 01:20:04.340
Let's finish this.

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:35.139
You're a piece of work, Dredd.

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:39.143
But then so am I.

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:45.149
You think I didn't know I'd get busted
some day. Goes with the territory.

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:49.070
This entire level is rigged
with enough high explosives

01:21:49.196 --> 01:21:51.447
to take out the top 50 stories.

01:21:52.533 --> 01:21:55.201
If they go, the rest go, too.

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:00.581
Like the jewelry?

01:22:03.752 --> 01:22:06.838
It's a transmitter synched
to my heart beat.

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:09.507
My heart stops beating,

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:14.679
the building blows. Everyone in it, ash.

01:22:19.018 --> 01:22:21.311
You got no way out, Judge.

01:22:23.522 --> 01:22:25.690
Put your gun down.

01:22:27.234 --> 01:22:30.570
Do you know
how many people live in this block?

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:36.075
This isn't a negotiation.
The sentence is death.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:39.829
You can't afford to take the risk.

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:19.577
We're a kilometer above ground.

01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:23.414
What do you figure
the range is on that thing?

01:23:24.792 --> 01:23:27.085
Could it get through 1
00 levels of concrete?

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:29.921
How about 200?

01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:32.673
Let's find out.

01:23:47.147 --> 01:23:51.109
Citizen Ma-Ma.
Your crimes are multiple homicide

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:54.612
and the manufacture
and distribution of narcotics.

01:23:54.738 --> 01:23:56.322
How do you plead?

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.789
Defense noted.

01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:31.852
Yeah!

01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:30.995
Anderson.

01:27:32.164 --> 01:27:35.916
Victims first.
Let the perps lay where they lie?

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:40.004
Your assessment's now over.

01:27:55.479 --> 01:27:56.479
Sir.

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:06.614
When I heard you'd called in a 10-24,
I thought I'd better check it out.

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:09.283
Seeing as I forced the rookie on you.

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:12.745
- So, what happened in there?
- Drug bust.

01:28:12.871 --> 01:28:16.666
- Look like you been through it.
- Perps were uncooperative.

01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:18.542
So how did she do?

01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:22.546
She a pass or a fail?

01:28:25.759 --> 01:28:27.301
Let's take a look?

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.679
She's a pass.

01:28:31.098 --> 01:28:32.848
I knew she would be.

01:28:37.771 --> 01:28:39.397
No time to waste. Let's move.

01:28:39.523 --> 01:28:40.723
Tell them to go to the back...

01:28:51.326 --> 01:28:53.160
Mega City One.

01:28:54.621 --> 01:28:58.708
800 million people
living in the ruin of the old world

01:28:58.834 --> 01:29:01.293
and the mega structures of the new one.

01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:07.007
Only one thing
fighting for order in the chaos,

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:09.760
Judges.
