OH, LOOK AT THAT
BEAUTIFUL MOON.

01:15.689 --> 01:18.955
OH, JUST MADE
FOR ROMANCE.

01:18.956 --> 01:21.921
IRMA, QUIT MOONING
ABOUT ROMANCE.

01:21.922 --> 01:24.121
WE'VE GOT
A NEWSCAST TO DO.

01:24.122 --> 01:26.455
YOU SHOULD PICK
ON IRMA, MR. THOMPSON.

01:26.456 --> 01:29.155
EVERY WOMAN IN TOWN
FEELS THE WAY IRMA DOES.

01:29.156 --> 01:32.289
HMM. EVERY WOMAN
IN TOWN, HUH?

01:32.290 --> 01:33.756
I SMELL RATINGS.

01:33.757 --> 01:35.491
PERFUME, FLOWERS,

01:35.492 --> 01:37.990
LONG MOONLIT WALKS--
THAT'S IT!

01:37.991 --> 01:40.057
WE'LL DO A SERIES

01:42.725 --> 01:46.391
WELL,
APRIL, FINALLY
A MILKSOP STORY

01:46.392 --> 01:47.758
YOU'RE QUALIFIED
TO COVER.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.824
I'M GLAD YOU
AGREE, VERNON,

01:49.825 --> 01:52.025
'CAUSE YOU'LL BE
HER CAMERAMAN.

01:52.026 --> 01:53.759
OH, GREAT.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.126
OH, PLEASE,
MR. THOMPSON,

01:56.127 --> 01:58.693
WHY CAN'T I DO
A STORY ON ALL
THE CRAZY CRIMES

01:58.694 --> 02:00.726
THAT HAPPEN WHEN
THERE'S A FULL MOON?

02:00.727 --> 02:03.127
BECAUSE
I WANT ROMANCE!

02:03.128 --> 02:05.160
TAKE A NUMBER
AND GET IN LINE.

02:15.296 --> 02:16.795
ALL RIGHT!

02:16.796 --> 02:19.029
WAY TO GO,
WOLFMAN.

02:19.030 --> 02:22.063
THAT IS ONE
HAIRY DUDE.

02:22.064 --> 02:23.329
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

02:23.330 --> 02:25.830
THE POOR SLOB
IS HALF-HUMAN
AND HALF-ANIMAL.

02:25.831 --> 02:27.230
WHAT AM I SAYING?

02:27.231 --> 02:31.497
REMEMBER, JOIN US
FOR A SPECIAL
CHANNEL 6 SERIES

02:31.498 --> 02:34.398

02:34.399 --> 02:36.599
COME ON!
BOO!

02:36.600 --> 02:38.832
BOO!
HOW BOGUS, DUDE.

02:38.833 --> 02:41.700
SOME PEOPLE JUST
HAVE NO TASTE.

02:41.701 --> 02:45.033
SHREDDER,
I NEED YOU!

02:45.034 --> 02:48.367
THAT'S WHAT I KEEP TRYING
TO TELL YOU, KRANG.

02:48.368 --> 02:51.267
AWW, I SEE YOU'RE
WEARING YOUR BEST SUIT.

02:51.268 --> 02:52.767
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

02:52.768 --> 02:54.668
YOU'LL SEE.

03:00.735 --> 03:02.835
A DEMONSTRATION, PLEASE.

03:08.504 --> 03:10.203
I PREFER TO SEE
THE AGONY

03:10.204 --> 03:11.604
ON THE FACES
OF MY ENEMIES

03:11.605 --> 03:12.903
AS I DESTROY THEM.

03:13.938 --> 03:14.971
WHAT?

03:14.972 --> 03:17.872
I AM LOTUS,

03:17.873 --> 03:20.005
NINJA WARRIOR!

03:20.006 --> 03:23.606
AHH, BOSS,
HE'S A DAME!

03:23.607 --> 03:27.172
LOTUS IS
YOUR REPLACEMENT.

03:27.173 --> 03:29.573
A FEMALE NINJA?

03:29.574 --> 03:31.173
WHY NOT?

03:31.174 --> 03:34.007
I'M AN EQUAL
OPPORTUNITY TYRANT.

03:34.008 --> 03:36.007
NO MERE SLIP
OF A GIRL

03:36.008 --> 03:37.374
CAN REPLACE ME.

03:37.375 --> 03:40.340
I CHALLENGE YOU
TO A NINJA CONTEST!

03:40.341 --> 03:44.074
YOUR CHALLENGE
IS ACCEPTED.

03:46.677 --> 03:48.742
BRAVO, LOTUS!

03:48.743 --> 03:52.009
I'D APPLAUD,
IF I HAD HANDS.

03:52.010 --> 03:53.843
YOU'LL REGRET THAT.

03:53.844 --> 03:57.743
AH, AH.
THE NINJA WHO
LOSES HIS TEMPER,

03:57.744 --> 03:59.310
LOSES THE BATTLE.

03:59.311 --> 04:01.577
AND YOU ARE ABOUT TO LOSE

04:01.578 --> 04:04.111
YOUR PRETTY LITTLE HEAD.

04:07.446 --> 04:10.512
HEY,
NO NINJA BIMBO

04:10.513 --> 04:12.978
CAN DO THAT
TO OUR BOSS.

04:12.979 --> 04:15.880
YEAH, WE'LL
FIX HER WAGON.

04:21.247 --> 04:24.781
WELL, AT LEAST
AFTER WE FIX HER WAGON,

04:24.782 --> 04:27.548
WE'LL HAVE PLENTY OF OIL
TO GREASE IT WITH.

04:29.982 --> 04:33.582
WELL, SHREDDER,
HAD ENOUGH PROOF?

04:33.583 --> 04:37.315
I'M GOING, KRANG,
BUT HEAR ME WELL.

04:37.316 --> 04:38.682
THE DAY WILL COME

04:38.683 --> 04:40.915
WHEN YOU'LL BEG ME
TO RETURN.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.816
EXCELLENT,
MY DEAR LOTUS!

04:47.817 --> 04:49.451
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE

04:49.452 --> 04:52.584
WHAT YOU HAVE IN STORE
FOR THE TURTLES.

04:52.585 --> 04:55.351
A MORE TRAGIC FATE,
I ASSURE YOU.

04:55.352 --> 04:58.186
JUST REMEMBER
OUR BARGAIN.

04:58.187 --> 05:02.185
YES, YES,
100 POUNDS OF GOLD.

05:02.186 --> 05:03.586
BUT FOR THAT PRICE,

05:03.587 --> 05:07.186
I WANT TO PERSONALLY
WITNESS THEIR END.

05:07.187 --> 05:10.053
I AM COMING
TO THE SURFACE
WITH YOU!

05:11.121 --> 05:13.521
UH, WHERE TO
NOW, BOSS?

05:13.522 --> 05:16.254
TO FIND THE TURTLES
BEFORE LOTUS DOES.

05:16.255 --> 05:19.321
I'LL SHOW KRANG
I'M NOT TO BE
SNEEZED AT!

05:28.523 --> 05:31.090
WHOA! WHEREVER YOU
BOYS CAME FROM,

05:31.091 --> 05:33.523
YOU MUST NOT
HAVE BEEN
TOO POPULAR.

05:33.524 --> 05:35.924
WE WANT A ROOM
WITH A BATH.

05:35.925 --> 05:37.725
WELL, I CAN SEE
YOU ALREADY BROUGHT

05:37.726 --> 05:39.157
YOUR OWN
FEATHER BEDS.

05:39.158 --> 05:41.991
ONE ROOM
AND NO WISECRACKS.

05:41.992 --> 05:45.158
OH, YES, SIR.
YES, SIR.

05:45.159 --> 05:47.925
NOW, THE FIRST
IN APRIL O'NEILL'S

05:47.926 --> 05:51.226
REPORTS ON ROMANCE
UNDER A FULL MOON.

05:51.227 --> 05:53.192
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
THE RIGHT FRAGRANCE

05:53.193 --> 05:55.160
TO SET THE STAGE
FOR ROMANCE.

05:55.161 --> 05:57.826
THAT'S WHY WE'RE
HERE AT THE OLAF
PERFUME FACTORY

05:57.827 --> 06:00.193
<i>TO ASK MONSIEUR OLAF
HOW HE DEVELOPS</i>

06:00.194 --> 06:02.161
HIS ROMANTIC
FRAGRANCES.

06:02.162 --> 06:04.728
OH, IT IS HIGHLY,
UM, HOW YOU SAY,

06:04.729 --> 06:06.462
<i>TOP SECRET,
MADEMOISELLE.</i>

06:06.463 --> 06:08.928
BEHIND THAT DOOR
WE HAVE A SCENT ANALYZER

06:08.929 --> 06:11.596
THAT CAN SNIFF OUT
ANY FRAGRANCE.

06:11.597 --> 06:13.195
AN ARMED GUARD?

06:13.196 --> 06:15.830
<i>OUI, WE HAVE 2 MORE
ON THE OTHER SIDE--</i>

06:22.998 --> 06:25.997
THESE PERFUME MAKERS
PLAY TOO ROUGH FOR ME!

06:25.998 --> 06:27.898
GANG WAY!

06:27.899 --> 06:30.132
<i>MON DIEU!
THE SCENT ANALYZER!</i>

06:31.765 --> 06:33.199
JUST AS I FEARED.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.699
IT IS GONE!

06:36.100 --> 06:38.233
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
LEFT IN IT'S PLACE.

06:38.234 --> 06:40.033
A LOTUS BLOSSOM?

06:40.034 --> 06:41.834
WHAT CAN IT MEAN?

06:42.902 --> 06:45.100
YEAH, WE AT AQUALAND,
HOPE YOU ENJOYED

06:45.101 --> 06:47.535
MEETING THESE GENTLE
CREATURES OF THE SEA.

06:47.536 --> 06:49.334
AND THAT CONCLUDES
OUR GIANT

06:49.335 --> 06:51.135
SEA TURTLE SHOW
FOR THIS EVENING.

06:51.136 --> 06:53.502
YOU ARE DR. GILLMAN,

06:53.503 --> 06:55.201
THE MARINE BIOLOGIST?

06:55.202 --> 06:57.168
YEAH, I HAVE
THAT PLEASURE.

06:57.169 --> 07:00.470
I WONDER IF I MIGHT
SPEAK TO YOU ALONE?

07:00.471 --> 07:03.904
I'M SORRY, MISS,
IT'S CLOSING TIME
AND I'M ALL TIED UP.

07:03.905 --> 07:06.637
YOU COULD NOT
BE MORE RIGHT!

07:06.638 --> 07:08.471
WHAT ON EARTH...

07:08.472 --> 07:12.971
YOU HAVE ANALYZED
THE GENETIC CODE
OF TURTLES.

07:12.972 --> 07:14.738
I NEED THAT CODE!

07:14.739 --> 07:17.972
YEAH? AND WHAT WILL
YOU DO IF I SHOULD REFUSE?

07:20.140 --> 07:23.139
YEAH. JUST CURIOUS.
IT'S IN THE RED FOLDER.

07:26.674 --> 07:29.407
WHOEVER STOLE OLAF'S
SCENT ANALYZER

07:29.408 --> 07:31.073
LEFT THIS LOTUS BLOSSOM.

07:31.074 --> 07:32.474
AND NOW THE WOMAN
WHO STOLE

07:32.475 --> 07:35.574
DR. GILLMAN'S
GENETIC FORMULA
LEFT ONE, TOO!

07:35.575 --> 07:38.308
THERE'S MUST BE
SOME CONNECTION,
BUT WHAT?

07:38.309 --> 07:42.042
SOUNDS TO ME LIKE
SOME FLIPPED OUT FLORIST.

07:42.043 --> 07:43.842
I WOULD NOT BE
TOO CERTAIN.

07:43.843 --> 07:45.409
THIS APPEARS
TO BE THE WORK

07:45.410 --> 07:47.076
OF A SUPERIOR MIND.

07:48.644 --> 07:51.744
FIRST WE TAKE
THE GENETIC CODE
FOR TURTLES,

07:51.745 --> 07:54.077
INSTALL IT INTO
THE SCENT ANALYZER,

07:54.078 --> 07:57.177
WHICH IS PROGRAMMED
TO SEEK OUT TURTLES.

07:57.178 --> 08:00.411
THE BIGGER THEY ARE,
THE EASIER TO FIND!

08:00.412 --> 08:04.645
HMM, YOU HAVE A FLAIR
FOR THE SCIENTIFIC.

08:04.646 --> 08:08.646
I BELIEVE WE WILL MAKE
AN UNDEFEATABLE TEAM!

08:10.046 --> 08:12.746
THE TURTLES
LAIR IS THAT WAY!

08:14.880 --> 08:16.413
WELL, GUYS,

08:16.414 --> 08:18.180
I'VE GOT TO DO
ANOTHER ROMANCE REPORT

08:18.181 --> 08:19.414
IN 15 MINUTES.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.013
PERMIT ME, APRIL.

08:21.014 --> 08:24.348
THIS LOTUS REMINDS ME
OF SOMEONE I HEARD ABOUT

08:24.349 --> 08:26.582
YEARS AGO IN JAPAN.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.816
A YOUNG GIRL,
10-YEARS-OLD,

08:29.817 --> 08:33.082
OF AMAZING SKILL WHO
WISHED TO BECOME A NINJA.

08:33.082 --> 08:35.716
BUT SOON SHE SURPASSED
ALL THE MASTERS

08:35.717 --> 08:37.515
WHO TRIED TO
INSTRUCT HER.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.517
EVEN AT THAT TENDER AGE,

08:39.518 --> 08:41.717
NO MAN COULD
MATCH HER SKILL.

08:43.217 --> 08:47.452
WOW! THAT WAS
A GREAT FLASHBACK,
MASTER SPLINTER.

08:47.453 --> 08:49.051
SO WHO WAS
THAT GIRL?

08:49.052 --> 08:50.318
HER NAME WAS--

08:51.453 --> 08:54.218
HER NAME IS LOTUS!

09:00.154 --> 09:01.120
FOOT SOLDIERS,
SEIZE HIM!

09:05.788 --> 09:07.887
THEY STUN-GUNNED
MASTER SPLINTER!

09:07.888 --> 09:10.354
LOW BLOW, DUDES.

09:10.355 --> 09:12.721
LET'S TEACH THEM
SOME TURTLE MANNERS.

09:13.923 --> 09:15.288
MR. THOMPSON,

09:15.289 --> 09:17.321
THE RATINGS SHOW
A 5-POINT JUMP

09:17.322 --> 09:19.388
SINCE APRIL'S FIRST
ROMANCE REPORT.

09:19.389 --> 09:21.723
I KNEW IT WOULD
GET BIG NUMBERS!

09:21.724 --> 09:24.724
THERE ARE A LOT
OF ROMANTIC FEMALES
OUT THERE.

09:24.725 --> 09:26.523
IN FACT, APRIL'S
NEXT REPORT

09:26.524 --> 09:27.957
IS DUE ON RIGHT NOW.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.424
I CAN'T PASS UP
THIS STORY!

09:32.459 --> 09:34.458
GO NOW!

09:34.459 --> 09:37.858
AND NOW WE GO LIVE
TO APRIL O'NEILL

09:37.859 --> 09:40.292
FOR A REPORT
ON ROMANCE.

09:40.293 --> 09:44.159
COWABUNGA!

09:44.160 --> 09:46.392
WHAT KIND OF ROMANCE
IS THIS?

09:46.393 --> 09:48.893
LOOKS LIKE MY LAST
BLIND DATE.

09:48.894 --> 09:51.126
ONLY THAT GUY'S
A BETTER DANCER...

09:51.127 --> 09:53.560
WHAT IS GOING ON?

09:53.561 --> 09:56.493
AND I GUESS WE GAVE
THOSE FOOT SOLDIERS
THE BOOT.

09:56.494 --> 09:59.327
HOLD ON. WHERE'S
MASTER SPLINTER?

09:59.328 --> 10:01.595
BUMMER, DUDES.
THEY GOT HIM.

10:01.596 --> 10:03.128
COME ON,
LET'S GO!

10:03.129 --> 10:05.663
NOT SO FAST, GREEN ONE.

10:05.664 --> 10:08.030
FIRST YOU MUST
GET PAST LOTUS.

10:09.097 --> 10:11.263
SHE'S MAGNIFICENT!

10:11.264 --> 10:13.797
LOTUS, I DON'T WANT
TO FIGHT YOU.

10:13.798 --> 10:16.430
THEN YOU HAD
BETTER SURRENDER!

10:16.431 --> 10:18.331
AHH, NO WAY, LADY!

10:19.366 --> 10:21.698
AH, NICE COSTUMES,
GENTLEMEN.

10:21.699 --> 10:23.330
BETTER THAN THOSE
CHICKEN SUITS

10:23.331 --> 10:24.731
YOU ARRIVED IN.

10:24.732 --> 10:25.798
QUIET, YOU IDIOT.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.866
OOH, LOOK, BOSS.

10:27.867 --> 10:30.465
IT'S THAT
TURTLE LEONARDO.

10:30.466 --> 10:32.899
AND THAT
LOTUS BIMBO.

10:32.900 --> 10:36.166
AHH, YOU TRY
MY PATIENCE, REPTILE!

10:37.300 --> 10:39.234
WOW, YOU'RE GOOD!

10:39.235 --> 10:42.134
YOU'RE NOT BAD YOURSELF.

10:43.635 --> 10:45.968
CREAM HER,
SHELL HEAD!

10:46.935 --> 10:50.235
AHH, TAKE THEM
APART, LOTUS.

10:50.236 --> 10:52.569
SOMEONE TRASH SOMEONE.

10:52.570 --> 10:53.568
GO!
GO !

10:53.569 --> 10:54.569
GO!
GO!

10:54.570 --> 10:55.503
GO!
GO!

10:57.069 --> 10:59.569
UM, GENTLEMEN,
I'M AFRAID THIS

10:59.570 --> 11:01.870
IS A BIT
TOO STIMULATING.

11:04.638 --> 11:08.037
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GIVE UP

11:08.038 --> 11:09.937
SO WE CAN
CATCH OUR BREATH?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.204
I'M NOT...

11:12.205 --> 11:13.705
A BIT TIRED.

11:14.773 --> 11:15.805
ALL RIGHT THEN,

11:15.806 --> 11:17.205
I GIVE UP.

11:18.473 --> 11:20.706
I ACCEPT
YOUR SURRENDER.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.574
SAYONARA FOR NOW.

11:29.708 --> 11:31.808
OUR VIEWERS ARE
REALLY UPSET.

11:31.809 --> 11:34.241
THEY THINK WE CANCELLED
THE ROMANCE REPORT

11:34.242 --> 11:35.975
FOR SOME CORNY
NINJA MOVIE.

11:35.976 --> 11:37.642
THAT DOES IT!

11:37.643 --> 11:39.409
CUT OFF APRIL'S FEED.

11:39.410 --> 11:41.542
AH, THANK GOODNESS!

11:41.543 --> 11:43.243
I'M SAFE AT LAST.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.809
NOT YET
YOU AREN'T.

11:44.810 --> 11:47.577
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
ROMANTIC PERFUMES REPORT?

11:47.578 --> 11:49.110
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

11:49.111 --> 11:50.677
I LEFT APRIL TO DO IT.

11:50.678 --> 11:52.544
I'M GIVING YOU
ANOTHER CHANCE.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.977
FIND THE NEAREST FLORIST
AND DO A REPORT

11:54.978 --> 11:56.878
ON THE ROMANCE
OF ROSES.

11:56.879 --> 11:58.645
UH, BUT, BUT, OH!

11:58.646 --> 11:59.977
NOW, HURRY.

11:59.978 --> 12:02.779
YOU'RE ON IN EXACTLY
6 MINUTES.

12:04.246 --> 12:05.879
DID YOU FIND
SPLINTER?

12:05.880 --> 12:09.312
MAJOR WIPE OUT,
BABE. NOT A TRACE.

12:10.414 --> 12:12.680
HEY, WHAT'S
WITH LEONARDO?

12:12.681 --> 12:15.179
LOTUS' SUCKERED HIM
WITH A TRICK SWORD.

12:15.180 --> 12:16.681
IT KNOCKED
HIM SILLY.

12:16.682 --> 12:20.281
WHY, THAT LOWDOWN,
DOUBLE-DEALING CHEATER!

12:20.282 --> 12:21.748
NO, NO!

12:21.749 --> 12:22.981
SHE'S CUNNING.

12:22.982 --> 12:24.448
SHE'S TREACHEROUS.

12:24.449 --> 12:27.416
AH, SHE'S WONDERFUL!

12:27.417 --> 12:30.449
WHY, LEONARDO,
UNDER THAT TOUGH SHELL

12:30.450 --> 12:32.916
BEATS THE HEART
OF A TRUE ROMANTIC.

12:32.917 --> 12:35.417
SWELL. WOULD YOU KINDLY
TELL ROMEO THAT

12:35.418 --> 12:37.784
<i>JULIET'S GOONS JUST
KIDNAPPED OUR SENSEI?</i>

12:37.785 --> 12:39.384
MASTER SPLINTER?

12:39.385 --> 12:40.983
WHAT ARE WE WAITING?

12:40.984 --> 12:42.718
LET'S RESCUE HIM!

12:42.719 --> 12:46.418
APRIL,
WHEREVER YOU ARE,
GET OVER TO AQUALAND

12:46.419 --> 12:48.819
AND START DOING
YOUR NEXT ROMANCE REPORT.

12:48.820 --> 12:50.218
AQUALAND?

12:50.219 --> 12:51.819
ALL RIGHT,
MR. THOMPSON.

12:53.221 --> 12:54.752
A FLOWER SHOP.

12:54.753 --> 12:56.520
I'VE GOT TO FIND
A FLOWER SHOP.

12:56.521 --> 12:59.086
AND NOW, HERE'S
VERNON FENWICK

12:59.087 --> 13:01.120
WITH THE CHANNEL 6
SPECIAL REPORT

13:01.121 --> 13:03.687
ON THE ROMANCE OF ROSES.

13:03.688 --> 13:04.955
OH, NO!

13:04.956 --> 13:06.188
THAT'S ME!

13:06.189 --> 13:07.520
THANK HEAVENS.

13:12.255 --> 13:15.422
I'M HERE AT THIS QUAINT
LITTLE FLOWER STAND
IN LITTLE TOKYO

13:15.423 --> 13:17.756
WITH THE MOST
ROMANTIC ROSES.

13:17.757 --> 13:19.990
OH, SO SORRY.

13:19.991 --> 13:21.522
NO ROSES.

13:21.523 --> 13:23.357
ONLY LOTUS BLOSSOMS!

13:23.358 --> 13:25.590
A BEAUTIFUL LADY
WHO LIVE UPSTAIRS

13:25.591 --> 13:27.524
BUYS THEM ALL THE TIME.

13:27.525 --> 13:29.591
LOTUS BLOSSOMS?

13:29.592 --> 13:31.324
SO THAT'S HER HIDE OUT!

13:31.325 --> 13:33.125
AND IN 5 MINUTES,

13:33.126 --> 13:37.092
APRIL O'NEILL REPORTS
FROM ROMANTIC AQUALAND.

13:37.093 --> 13:38.292
COME WITH ME.

13:38.293 --> 13:39.759
WE'RE GOING TO AQUALAND.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.726
WE'RE GOING TO LEAD
THE TURTLES

13:41.727 --> 13:43.060
BACK TO LOTUS.

13:43.061 --> 13:45.560
WE'RE HELPING
THE TURTLES?

13:45.561 --> 13:48.326
AIN'T NOTHING
SACRED NO MORE?

13:48.327 --> 13:51.527
IT'S SO THEY CAN FINISH
EACH OTHER OFF.

13:51.528 --> 13:54.928
THIS IS APRIL O'NEILL
HERE ON THE ROMANTIC

13:54.929 --> 13:57.262
OCEAN VIEW WALK
AT AQUALAND.

13:57.263 --> 14:00.228
FINALLY, A REPORT
ON ROMANCE.

14:00.229 --> 14:02.462
THE PERFECT SPOT
TO HOLD HANDS

14:02.463 --> 14:04.129
AND GAZE AT THE MOON
WITH SOMEONE YOU--

14:07.597 --> 14:09.130
OH, MY GOODNESS!

14:15.698 --> 14:19.265
LOTUS COULD HAVE TAKEN
MASTER SPLINTER ANYWHERE.

14:19.266 --> 14:22.198
IT LIKE LOOKING
FOR A NEEDLE
IN A HAYSTACK.

14:22.199 --> 14:25.233
HEY, DUDES,
CHECK OUT THE TUBE.

14:25.234 --> 14:28.933
THE SCENE HERE
AT AQUALAND IS ONE
OF TOTAL DESTRUCTION.

14:28.934 --> 14:30.167
NO WONDER.

14:30.168 --> 14:32.566
IT'S BEBOP
AND ROCK STEADY.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.933
DONATELLO,
HEAD FOR AQUALAND!

14:37.868 --> 14:39.068
THE TURTLES!

14:39.069 --> 14:41.267
I KNEW THIS WOULD
BRING THEM.

14:44.369 --> 14:46.202
DON'T LOSE HIM,
DONATELLO.

14:49.837 --> 14:51.702
ASSIGNMENT COMPLETED.

14:51.703 --> 14:53.136
THE GOLD, PLEASE.

14:53.137 --> 14:54.503
NOT YET.

14:54.504 --> 14:56.904
I STILL DON'T
HAVE THE TURTLES.

14:58.637 --> 15:00.637
THE TURTLES!

15:00.638 --> 15:02.504
HOW DID THEY
FIND US?

15:02.505 --> 15:04.838
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

15:04.839 --> 15:07.239
BRING THE RODENT HERE.

15:08.939 --> 15:10.572
IT'S MASTER SPLINTER!

15:10.573 --> 15:13.106
STOP RIGHT
THERE, TURTLES.

15:13.107 --> 15:14.606
ONE MORE STEP

15:14.607 --> 15:16.372
AND I MAKE THIS RAT

15:16.373 --> 15:17.773
GO SPLAT!

15:23.708 --> 15:25.841
SURRENDER YOUR WEAPONS

15:25.842 --> 15:28.740
OR THIS RAT GOES FLAT!

15:28.741 --> 15:30.608
THOSE SCUZZ BUCKETS
HAVE GOT SPLINTER.

15:30.609 --> 15:32.741
DO AS HE SAYS.

15:32.742 --> 15:33.875
COOL IT, DUDES.

15:33.876 --> 15:35.009
WE'RE DROPPING THEM.

15:36.110 --> 15:38.209
I'LL TRY TO SLIP IN
THE BACK WAY.

15:38.210 --> 15:40.076
CAN YOU STALL KRANG?

15:40.077 --> 15:41.943
CAN TURTLES
BREAK DANCE?

15:41.944 --> 15:44.377
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
GOING TO RUMBLE,

15:44.378 --> 15:45.477
HUH, BOSS?

15:45.478 --> 15:48.477
YES. AND NO
MATTER WHO LOSES,

15:48.478 --> 15:50.643
IT'LL BE
SOMEONE I HATE.

15:52.846 --> 15:53.879
GET IN, APRIL.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.745
BERN SAYS YOU'VE GOT
ONE LAST CHANCE

15:55.746 --> 15:57.711
TO DO THAT SEGMENT
ON ROMANCE.

15:57.712 --> 15:59.779
AFTER THAT
INCREDIBLE FOOTAGE?

15:59.780 --> 16:02.113
MUTANTS TRASHING
AN AMUSEMENT PARK

16:02.114 --> 16:04.612
IS NOT
BERN THOMPSON'S
IDEA OF ROMANCE.

16:04.613 --> 16:06.413
HOW AM I GOING
TO FIND A FLORIST

16:06.414 --> 16:07.880
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE?

16:07.881 --> 16:10.214
I KNOW
JUST THE PLACE.

16:17.382 --> 16:19.382
WELCOME, LEONARDO.

16:19.383 --> 16:20.981
I HOPE YOU
ARE WELL RESTED

16:20.982 --> 16:22.549
AFTER OUR LAST
BATTLE?

16:22.550 --> 16:25.083
AHH, I HAD
A PLEASANT NAP,

16:25.084 --> 16:27.649
THANKS TO THAT
TRICK SWORD OF YOURS.

16:27.650 --> 16:29.750
AHH, I HAD NO CHOICE.

16:29.751 --> 16:31.717
YOU ARE MOST SKILLFUL.

16:31.718 --> 16:34.450
AS A TEAM, YOU AND I
WOULD BE UNBEATABLE!

16:36.419 --> 16:39.385
EXCEPT I BATTLE
FOR THE CAUSE OF GOOD.

16:39.386 --> 16:41.318
FOR YOU, LEONARDO,

16:41.319 --> 16:42.852
I WOULD
GIVE UP CRIME.

16:42.853 --> 16:46.186
JOIN ME AND TOGETHER
WE WILL BE NINJAS
FOR HIRE!

16:49.620 --> 16:51.820
ENOUGH STALLING.

16:51.821 --> 16:53.220
SEIZE THEM!

16:53.221 --> 16:55.553
AH, WHAT A LETDOWN.

16:55.554 --> 16:58.954
ALL THOSE WEAPONS
AND NO FIGHTING.

16:58.955 --> 17:01.021
OHH, LOOKS LIKE
THIS LOTUS IS

17:01.022 --> 17:03.021
YOUR REPLACEMENT
FOR GOOD.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.755
HA, NOT QUITE.

17:04.756 --> 17:07.588
I'VE A FEW TRICKS
LEFT UP MY SLEEVE.

17:07.589 --> 17:09.122
OHH, OHH,
CAN I SEE?

17:09.123 --> 17:10.756
IF I JOIN YOU,

17:10.757 --> 17:12.888
WILL YOU HELP ME
RESCUE MY MASTER?

17:12.890 --> 17:14.022
I CAN NOT!

17:14.023 --> 17:16.623
I'M BEING PAID
TO KIDNAP SPLINTER.

17:16.624 --> 17:18.723
AFTER ALL,
I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

17:18.723 --> 17:21.589
AND I CAN'T
BE A TRAITOR
TO A FRIEND.

17:22.657 --> 17:24.357
THEN BE DESTROYED
WITH HIM!

17:27.558 --> 17:29.591
I'M SORRY,
LEONARDO.

17:29.592 --> 17:31.792
IT WOULD NEVER
WORK OUT BETWEEN US.

17:31.793 --> 17:35.126
YOU DO NOT RESPECT
MY CAREER.

17:36.693 --> 17:38.559
WHERE AM I?

17:38.560 --> 17:40.826
RIGHT WHERE I WANT YOU,

17:40.827 --> 17:43.261
YOU MUTANT MAGGOT.

17:43.262 --> 17:45.627
MY JOB
IS DONE, KRANG.

17:45.628 --> 17:47.028
NOW, PAY ME!

17:47.029 --> 17:49.128
NOT SO FAST,
YOU TRAITOR!

17:49.129 --> 17:52.395
WHO DARES
CALL ME TRAITOR?

17:52.396 --> 17:54.195
WE DIDN'T
SAY NOTHING.

17:54.196 --> 17:55.762
HE SAID IT.

17:55.763 --> 17:58.229
SHREDDER,
YOU HAS-BEEN.

17:58.230 --> 18:00.496
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

18:00.497 --> 18:03.929
SAVING YOU FROM
YOUR OWN FOLLY, KRANG.

18:03.930 --> 18:06.197
SHE LED THE TURTLES
HERE ON PURPOSE.

18:06.198 --> 18:07.631
LIAR!

18:07.632 --> 18:09.330
YOU BETRAYED KRANG

18:09.331 --> 18:11.897
BECAUSE OF
YOUR FEELINGS
FOR THIS TURTLE.

18:11.898 --> 18:14.297
FOR THIS TREACHERY
I PAID YOU

18:14.298 --> 18:16.965
100 POUNDS OF GOLD?

18:16.966 --> 18:18.731
I NEVER
BETRAYED YOU.

18:18.732 --> 18:21.799
MY FEELING HAVE
NOTHING TO DO
WITH OUR BARGAIN.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.199
DEALS OFF.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.300
LOSE THE GOLD.

18:24.301 --> 18:27.033
SO BE IT!

18:30.868 --> 18:33.534
THE RAT WAS
PLAYING POSSUM!

18:33.535 --> 18:35.034
STOP HIM!

18:37.136 --> 18:38.701
DIG IT, DUDES.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.468
HERE'S A FEW WEAPONS
WE FORGOT TO LAY DOWN.

18:43.403 --> 18:45.170
YOU FORGOT
TO SEARCH THEM.

18:45.171 --> 18:46.602
HOW AMATEURISH.

18:46.603 --> 18:49.303
AMATEURISH, AM I?

18:51.371 --> 18:52.937
THIS IS
APRIL O'NEILL,

18:52.938 --> 18:55.137
IN HER ONGOING
SEARCH FOR LOVE
AND ROMANCE.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.938
MAMA!

19:01.072 --> 19:02.772
HELLO, BERN,
GET READY

19:02.773 --> 19:04.739
FOR THAT REPORT
ON ROSES YOU WANTED.

19:06.740 --> 19:08.339
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

19:08.340 --> 19:12.074
FOR ONCE APRIL IS
ACTUALLY GOING
TO FOLLOW ORDERS.

19:12.075 --> 19:13.672
SO HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN

19:13.673 --> 19:16.207
SELLING ROSES
AT THIS STAND?

19:16.208 --> 19:17.907
NO, NO ROSES,

19:17.908 --> 19:20.340
I TELL YOU.
ONLY LOTUSES.

19:23.142 --> 19:24.541
CHANNEL 6.

19:24.542 --> 19:25.507
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

19:27.076 --> 19:29.543
MR. THOMPSON,
THE VIEWERS
ARE GOING WILD!

19:29.544 --> 19:31.008
I KNOW.

19:31.009 --> 19:33.376
THEY HATE
MONSTER MOVIES.

19:33.377 --> 19:34.275
NO,

19:34.276 --> 19:37.243
THEY ABSOLUTELY LOVE
ALL THE CRAZINESS.

19:37.244 --> 19:38.476
THEY WANT
TO SEE MORE.

19:38.477 --> 19:39.710
THAT'S IT!

19:39.711 --> 19:42.211
OUR NEW ON-LOCATION SERIES.

19:42.212 --> 19:46.577
OH, THIS WEEK,
APRIL O'NEILL REPORTS
ON FULL MOON MADNESS!

19:46.578 --> 19:47.611
IT'LL BE A SMASH!

19:53.013 --> 19:54.645
HEY GUYS,

19:54.646 --> 19:55.779
WHERE YOU GOING?

20:02.081 --> 20:04.947
SHREDDER, FANCY
SEEING YOU HERE.

20:04.948 --> 20:07.881
SURELY YOU'RE NOT
LEAVING WITHOUT ME?

20:07.882 --> 20:09.281
DON'T WORRY,

20:09.282 --> 20:11.881
I'LL WRITE YOU A NICE
POISON-PEN LETTER.

20:11.882 --> 20:13.515
PLEASE,

20:13.516 --> 20:14.982
I'LL DO ANYTHING.

20:14.983 --> 20:17.249
JUST TAKE ME
WITH YOU.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.083
DO YOU PROMISE NEVER
TO INSULT ME AGAIN?

20:20.084 --> 20:23.416
OH, I PROMISE.
NOW GET ME OUT
OF HERE,

20:23.417 --> 20:26.184
YOU TIN-FACED MORON.

20:28.017 --> 20:30.951
HEY, BOSS,
WAIT FOR US!

20:30.952 --> 20:32.951
NO, YOU CRETINS,

20:32.952 --> 20:34.651
WAIT TILL
I GET DOWN FIRST.

20:38.486 --> 20:42.186
LOTUS, WITH YOUR
GREAT NINJA SKILLS,

20:42.187 --> 20:45.120
YOU'D BE A POWERFUL
FORCE FOR GOOD.

20:45.121 --> 20:48.420
YES, WHY DON'T YOU STAY
AND WORK WITH US?

20:48.421 --> 20:50.153
SORRY, TURTLES.

20:50.154 --> 20:53.387
BUT THERE'S NOT MUCH
GOLD IN GOODNESS.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.788
TILL WE
MEET AGAIN...

20:59.789 --> 21:01.556
SAYONARA!

21:03.022 --> 21:05.589
LIKE, LIGHTEN
UP, DUDE.

21:05.590 --> 21:07.056
YOU'LL SEE
HER AGAIN.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.557
AHH, NO,

21:08.558 --> 21:10.590
I DON'T THINK
I WILL, MICHELANGELO.

21:12.257 --> 21:14.257
HEY, WHO SENT US
A PIZZA?

21:14.258 --> 21:16.391
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE SHOULD
TIP THE KID.

21:19.093 --> 21:22.358
HMM, MOST STRANGE.

21:22.359 --> 21:24.292
WAY WEIRD.

21:24.293 --> 21:27.458
WHAT KIND OF BOGUS
TOPPING IS THIS?

21:27.459 --> 21:29.825
YOU NEED "FLOWER"
TO MAKE A PIZZA,

21:29.826 --> 21:31.392
BUT THIS
IS RIDICULOUS.

21:35.395 --> 21:38.327
MAYBE SOMEDAY,
LEONARDO,

21:38.328 --> 21:41.260
YOU AND I WILL BE
ON THE SAME SIDE.
