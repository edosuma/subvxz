WEBVTT

00:09.040 --> 00:11.768
We're not going to run for it.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.724
We most certainly are not.

00:25.320 --> 00:28.119
Mr Petrukhin?

00:28.120 --> 00:29.919
Yes, that's me.

00:29.920 --> 00:33.239
You're a busy man, Mr Petrukhin,
aren't you?

00:33.240 --> 00:34.679
And who might you be?

00:34.680 --> 00:41.044
I want you to come to this address
at 10.30 precisely tomorrow morning.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.079
This is a simple arrangement

00:43.080 --> 00:45.159
which could be... extremely
beneficial.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.679
10.30 tomorrow? I don't think so.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.879
As you said yourself, I'm a very
busy man.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.119
And what goes on at this address?

00:52.120 --> 00:55.519
- What is it?
- Well, be there tomorrow on the dot,

00:55.520 --> 00:58.611
and then you'll find out who I am.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.519
- Invitation?
- I've got it here.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.559
It's a little battered, I'm afraid.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.799
It was in my hand in the car
and it got like that.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.039
Once they've started,
nobody is allowed in.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.399
But I'm not late yet, am I?

01:18.400 --> 01:21.319
You're not late yet,
but in a few seconds,

01:21.320 --> 01:23.479
- you will be.
- Can I pass, then,

01:23.480 --> 01:26.026
so I make sure I'm not late?

01:28.200 --> 01:30.000
Thank you.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.279
I can't be late! I can't be.

01:51.280 --> 01:53.719
- You are too late.
- I had an accident getting into the car.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.399
I've been ready for hours.
This isn't fair at all.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.959
Please, let me in.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.120
Please.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.879
I've never begged for anything,
but I'm sort of begging now.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.062
It's not possible, miss.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.359
Can I have a peep?

02:13.360 --> 02:15.360
Just for a moment.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.855
Miss Alexandra Fitzwilliam.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.975
Miss Lucinda Norton-Greene.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.073
Miss Georgina Winstanley.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.720
So, how was it?

03:02.360 --> 03:05.559
Well... it happened.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.639
I was there.

03:06.640 --> 03:08.159
You met the Queen?

03:08.160 --> 03:10.919
I met the Queen. Yes, Mum.

03:10.920 --> 03:12.599
I was presented.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.039
It was all... exciting.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.599
- What did she say to you?
- Hardly anything - it was very quick,

03:17.600 --> 03:21.319
just kneeling in front of her
and all that.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.119
- Good!
- Well, almost kneeling.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.719
I'm glad.

03:24.720 --> 03:27.319
Now you can look forward
to the rest of the season.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.360
So I can.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.199
Miss, please!

03:41.200 --> 03:43.159
No, no! You've got to let me in.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.999
My parents will never forgive me!

03:45.000 --> 03:46.119
- Please...
- No!

03:46.120 --> 03:47.599
Your Majesty!

03:47.600 --> 03:50.399
Your Majesty, my shoe broke.

03:50.400 --> 03:53.559
Your Majesty, my shoe broke!

03:53.560 --> 03:54.959
No! No!

03:54.960 --> 03:57.319
Your Majesty! No!

03:57.320 --> 03:58.679
I was only a little late!

03:58.680 --> 04:02.044
You have to understand,
my shoe broke!

04:09.560 --> 04:12.197
Thank God that didn't happen!

04:44.680 --> 04:46.240
Come in.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.079
Go straight through, Mr Petrukhin.

04:51.080 --> 04:55.159
Welcome, Mr Petrukhin. It is...

04:55.160 --> 04:57.679
exactly 10.30.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.239
That's a good start.

04:59.240 --> 05:03.331
- Please, have a seat.
- Thank you for coming.

05:04.320 --> 05:05.679
Are you Mr Macfarlane?

05:05.680 --> 05:09.159
No, I'm Mr Field,
this is Mr Denning.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.399
There is no Mr Macfarlane.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.399
- Is he dead?
- He doesn't exist.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.199
He never existed.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.039
We work for the government,
Mr Petrukhin.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.759
- I see.
- A little subterfuge

05:21.760 --> 05:25.439
is necessary because of the
sensitivity of some of our work.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.039
Hence these offices.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.479
How do you like the furniture?

05:28.480 --> 05:32.439
We bought it all very recently
at the Ideal Home Exhibition.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.999
Very up-to-the-minute.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.319
- Exactly, which is what we're about.
- Why on earth

05:36.320 --> 05:38.759
- do you want to see me?
- We want to see you, Mr Petrukhin,

05:38.760 --> 05:41.799
because we're very interested
in your staff locator.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.319
Very interested indeed.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.847
We think it may have
possibilities for us.

05:46.848 --> 05:48.599
That it might be useful

05:48.600 --> 05:51.079
in certain government buildings,
for instance.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.359
In particular,
various military establishments

05:53.360 --> 05:55.879
- and high-security sites.
- Does that make sense to you,

05:55.880 --> 05:58.999
- Mr Petrukhin?
- It does, yes, most certainly.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.319
If you really are who you say you
are - I will need to see proof.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.599
And I will need to visit
the sites personally.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.719
No, no, we're not there yet.

06:06.720 --> 06:09.479
We first had to meet you
to satisfy ourselves

06:09.480 --> 06:12.519
that you can keep this information
completely confidential.

06:12.520 --> 06:15.399
I'll need to tell my colleague,
Mr Courtney Johnson, of course.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.519
- We work together installing...
- You will tell no-one.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.359
No-one?

06:20.360 --> 06:24.633
Absolutely no-one.
Do you think you can do that?

06:27.280 --> 06:29.799
Well, if that's really necessary,

06:29.800 --> 06:32.279
then of course I can do that.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.359
Really, Mr Petrukhin?

06:34.360 --> 06:37.439
You're not going to say,
"You'll never guess what happened -

06:37.440 --> 06:39.399
"I was followed everywhere
by this black car

06:39.400 --> 06:40.559
"and these five men get out

06:40.560 --> 06:42.759
"and walk towards me like
they're going to kill me,

06:42.760 --> 06:46.199
"and then they tell me to report
to Macfarlane Investments,

06:46.200 --> 06:48.079
"that turns out not to even exist.

06:48.080 --> 06:52.639
"Instead it's a secret government
organisation in strange offices

06:52.640 --> 06:55.039
"filled with modern furniture"?

06:55.040 --> 06:57.239
You wouldn't tell anybody that?

06:57.240 --> 07:01.240
Because if it happened to me,
I know I would.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.319
I would have to tell someone.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.920
But I won't.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.639
There you are!
Please, have a seat and see this.

07:21.640 --> 07:23.799
You got my message
that I would be dropping by?

07:23.800 --> 07:25.199
Of course.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.199
These ladies gave up
a little of their lunch break

07:28.200 --> 07:30.799
to see if this apparatus
can help them hear the music.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.919
I want to see if we can develop
a hearing aid that's strong enough

07:33.920 --> 07:39.239
so that they can hear more than just
the vibrations of the sound.

07:39.240 --> 07:42.439
We can send a rocket into space
and maybe soon a man to the moon,

07:42.440 --> 07:47.622
so we should be able to make
everybody hear, shouldn't we?

07:49.320 --> 07:50.759
Well, it's a start.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.670
It most certainly is.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.999
They're saying it worked.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.479
I hope this is OK.

07:56.480 --> 08:00.039
Yes.
I love disgustingly smelly cheese.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.479
Really ripe ones.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.480
Richard isn't so keen.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.480
My God, that's strong!

08:09.400 --> 08:11.219
And that is perfect.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.639
You said in your message there was
something you wished to say to me.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.479
Yes.
Well, I wanted to apologise,

08:18.480 --> 08:21.319
really, because when you came
to our house, Arthur -

08:21.320 --> 08:26.519
Lord Wallington - was there, and I
know he does ask a lot of questions.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.559
A lot of very penetrating questions.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.119
Well, this is ridiculous!
You don't have to come and apologise

08:31.120 --> 08:33.479
for giving us such a remarkable day.
Quite the opposite!

08:33.480 --> 08:35.198
Remarkable?

08:35.200 --> 08:36.759
Well, how was it remarkable?

08:36.760 --> 08:39.279
Well, of course it was -
seeing your tremendous garden,

08:39.280 --> 08:40.917
your whole estate.

08:42.880 --> 08:46.880
And little Sasha,
he enjoyed himself, did he?

08:47.760 --> 08:50.306
Absolutely, I'm sure he did.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.039
He's quite a sensitive little boy,
isn't he?

08:54.040 --> 08:55.199
He is.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.799
- But delightful.
- Thank you.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.039
I hope he's being delightful
at his new school.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.680
Yes, yes, Marlham House.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.639
- Yes, I forgot you know it.
- I do.

09:06.640 --> 09:09.639
I just wanted to say
I've come bearing another invitation

09:09.640 --> 09:12.719
for you and your family.
Every year we have a fete,

09:12.720 --> 09:15.159
because of Richard being
the local MP,

09:15.160 --> 09:16.959
and we hold it in our garden,

09:16.960 --> 09:19.519
and I just thought it might be
something that you'd all enjoy.

09:19.520 --> 09:22.559
Well, that would be marvellous!

09:22.560 --> 09:26.119
- Courtney. You remember Mrs Shaw?
- Of course.

09:26.120 --> 09:30.484
Mr Samuel, I must have a word with
you right now.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.879
- Well?
- Well, what?

09:32.880 --> 09:34.679
Mr Samuel, you know exactly what
I mean.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.039
What happened with those men?
What was it all about?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.239
I can't tell you.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.039
You can't tell me? Why?!

09:41.040 --> 09:42.359
Because that's what they want.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.079
- At the moment.
- And who are "they"?

09:44.080 --> 09:46.479
Who are these men who've forbidden
you to say anything?

09:46.480 --> 09:48.639
- I can't tell you.
- You can't tell me that either?

09:48.640 --> 09:50.759
I was there, remember.
I saw them too.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.479
Is it just me that's not
allowed to know?

09:52.480 --> 09:54.519
Nobody is allowed to know, Courtney.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.719
Absolutely nobody.

09:56.720 --> 10:00.319
"Dear Hanny,
I'm writing this very, very quickly"

10:00.320 --> 10:02.359
"because they look at what you're
writing"

10:02.360 --> 10:04.959
"and they want us
to say how happy we are,"

10:04.960 --> 10:08.159
"and, Hanny,
I can't say I'm very happy."

10:08.160 --> 10:13.979
He's watching us like a hawk, that...
I heard that!

10:14.880 --> 10:16.999
So you think you can whisper.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.479
I can promise you I can detect
any whisper at any time,

10:20.480 --> 10:22.999
and unfortunately for you,
Plumptree,

10:23.000 --> 10:25.759
I heard exactly what you said.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.200
Stand up!

10:30.080 --> 10:32.353
Now follow me, Plumptree.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.999
It will only be six strokes
of the hairbrush today.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.728
But next time, it will be more.
Bend over.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.839
I really nearly did hammer on the
door with my broken shoe,

10:53.840 --> 10:56.399
screaming, "Let me in! Let me in!"

10:56.400 --> 10:59.559
I'll never be able to tell my
parents what happened.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.799
I just have to keep lying,

11:00.800 --> 11:03.359
and it's so difficult with them
because they always

11:03.360 --> 11:05.159
- want to know everything...
- Well...

11:05.160 --> 11:07.199
we all have things
we can't tell people.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.199
You know, Hannah, it's the exact
opposite of Cinderella, isn't it?

11:11.200 --> 11:12.759
You never got to go to the ball!

11:12.760 --> 11:16.839
Well, not that one, but I've got
the whole bloody season now!

11:16.840 --> 11:19.999
Three or four parties a week,
all designed to pair me off

11:20.000 --> 11:22.559
with some totally unsuitable
chinless chap.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.039
And what about your friends?

11:24.040 --> 11:27.959
What do they think about you doing
the season?

11:27.960 --> 11:30.719
Truth is, I don't have many friends.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.119
I read too many books,
don't go out -

11:33.120 --> 11:34.959
except now I have to, of course.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.879
I'm interested in politics
and the news.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.519
Sort of dull, really. Rebellious
and dull - not a great combination!

11:41.520 --> 11:43.430
And a Jew, of course.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.399
That was a joke.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.839
I shouldn't have said that.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.519
I'm proud of being Jewish.

11:49.520 --> 11:53.339
The one thing you are not,
Hannah, is dull.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.720
Thank you.

11:56.120 --> 12:01.599
Except I've just talked entirely
about myself since I got here.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.279
How does somebody like you
end up teaching etiquette class,

12:04.280 --> 12:06.119
for goodness' sake?

12:06.120 --> 12:07.666
Because I'm lazy.

12:08.920 --> 12:11.039
And because I want to be a novelist.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.479
You're a writer?

12:13.480 --> 12:14.799
How exciting!

12:14.800 --> 12:17.999
No, no, that's really exciting.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.319
What sort of books do you write?
Who are your influences?

12:20.320 --> 12:22.879
No, no, I'm not telling you
anything.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.679
Not until I've had something
accepted.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.479
Until I know I'm going to
be published.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.319
Well, I won't let you get away with
that.

12:29.320 --> 12:30.640
I'm very nosy.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.999
No, I insist.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.839
Well, thank you so much.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.879
If you're very nosy, Hannah...

12:37.880 --> 12:39.919
- I am...
- then...

12:39.920 --> 12:42.830
you might be interested in this.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.159
They need volunteers for the day.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.439
It's a civil defence exercise.

12:48.440 --> 12:50.039
In case of nuclear attack.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.759
You're joking!

12:51.760 --> 12:55.679
My other worst nightmare -
bombs and rockets.

12:55.680 --> 12:56.839
What do you have to do?

12:56.840 --> 12:59.239
Just lie down and play dead
somewhere, I think.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.159
Sounds fun, I know.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.359
I'm going to do it.
Volunteered already.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.119
Because I'm nosy too.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.239
Tell you more about it
after the show, if you like.

13:07.240 --> 13:09.119
You're very punctual again,

13:09.120 --> 13:11.760
Mr Petrukhin. Excellent.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.359
This is Guy.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.279
He's often here in the evening.

13:18.280 --> 13:21.917
Today, we're just
going down the passage.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.000
Stay.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.439
Take a seat, please, Mr Petrukhin.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.159
A film show!

13:33.160 --> 13:35.959
You've been very good, Mr Petrukhin,

13:35.960 --> 13:38.159
and not told anybody about us.

13:38.160 --> 13:42.039
- How do you know that?
- We have just one final little test.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.719
No need to be nervous.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.519
It's very simple, really.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.959
We want you to react

13:47.960 --> 13:50.719
to what you see on the screen.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.839
We want you to say out loud

13:52.840 --> 13:55.039
exactly what you feel about it.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.959
But you need to mean it,
Mr Petrukhin.

13:56.960 --> 14:00.079
Or else what? I lose the order?
What kind of test is this?

14:00.080 --> 14:03.239
It's just our little film show,
Mr Petrukhin.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.039
Indulge us.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.128
Yes, the Queen.

14:11.240 --> 14:15.359
Well, that's easy - I'm a great
supporter of the monarchy.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.279
Is that the kind of thing
you're looking for?

14:17.280 --> 14:19.239
Just say what you want to say,
Mr Petrukhin.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.079
My daughter's just been presented
to the Queen, as it happens,

14:22.080 --> 14:25.899
only the other day.
She's doing the season.

14:26.760 --> 14:28.033
The races!

14:28.960 --> 14:30.999
Is that good?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.319
Am I doing well?

14:32.320 --> 14:33.759
Am I scoring highly?

14:33.760 --> 14:36.399
Which one of you is doing
the marking, by the way?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.759
Yes, a marvellous man.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.199
We do his hearing aid,
but of course you know that already.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.639
You followed me there
for some extraordinary reason.

14:44.640 --> 14:48.599
I don't know why you couldn't have
just come to my office.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.439
The monster of all monsters.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.713
We should've stopped him much
sooner.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.519
I'm sure you can agree with that.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.199
We're not going to the camps now,
are we?

14:59.200 --> 15:04.279
I still can't watch those horrors
without bursting into tears.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.199
That's a relief!
I love the English countryside.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.559
It's very small compared to Russia,
of course,

15:10.560 --> 15:14.560
my first memories,
but it has its own beauty.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.839
Yes. New workers.

15:17.840 --> 15:23.840
I'm an immigrant myself, so I'm not
going to be against them, am I?

15:24.080 --> 15:26.080
Well, I'm not, anyway.

15:31.480 --> 15:32.959
The dog's making a noise.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.639
Don't worry about the dog.

15:34.640 --> 15:37.959
We'll only need to worry
if he starts barking.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.439
What does it mean if it starts
barking?

15:40.440 --> 15:45.599
- Why do you need to worry?
- Look at the screen, Mr Petrukhin.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.839
Yes, the Suez Crisis.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.279
A national humiliation, of course.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.879
Lies were told.

15:51.880 --> 15:55.039
Should we have gone to war
over the canal?

15:55.040 --> 15:57.359
Total incompetence,
like most governments.

15:57.360 --> 16:00.270
All governments are incompetent.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.451
What the hell is this?!

16:10.960 --> 16:12.559
What are you testing me about here?

16:12.560 --> 16:15.833
Whatever it is, it's a step too far!

16:16.600 --> 16:18.919
My private life -
is that what you want to know about?

16:18.920 --> 16:23.830
It happens to be totally,
completely... above reproach.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.439
Which government department
do you work for?

16:26.440 --> 16:29.039
It probably doesn't even exist,
because there is clearly

16:29.040 --> 16:32.313
something very strange
about you two!

16:35.400 --> 16:38.799
We're members of MI5, Mr Petrukhin.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.759
As I'm sure you've already guessed.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.799
Well, I will need to see proof.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.039
I need to speak to your superiors.

16:46.040 --> 16:47.079
Of course.

16:47.080 --> 16:50.079
How would an Air Vice-Marshal
and four Army Generals do?

16:50.080 --> 16:51.679
Because, the next time we see you,

16:51.680 --> 16:55.439
you'll be demonstrating
the staff locator to them.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.999
Where?

16:57.000 --> 16:58.199
You'll see.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.079
Until then, enjoy the moment.

17:00.080 --> 17:03.444
Enjoy the fact that we're in
business.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.200
But don't tell anyone.

17:17.680 --> 17:21.319
The Petrukhin family is here!
How good you could come.

17:21.319 --> 17:23.079
We wouldn't miss this for the world.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.719
And here's my favourite young man.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.638
You're looking very grown-up
today, Sasha.

17:27.640 --> 17:30.999
And Hannah here has been presented
to the Queen since you last saw her.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.719
And do you feel different?

17:32.720 --> 17:34.519
No, not quite yet, no.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.799
I thought I might've come over-dressed
for a country fete, but clearly I'm not.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.255
I feel I've come dressed for
the beach!

17:53.720 --> 17:56.799
There's Courtney.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.599
Better watch out for your prizes!

17:58.600 --> 18:01.237
He's a very competitive chap.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.720
I told you!

18:41.360 --> 18:42.960
Mwah!

18:44.720 --> 18:46.079
One!

18:46.080 --> 18:47.119
Two!

18:47.120 --> 18:48.439
Three!

18:48.440 --> 18:50.200
Four!

18:53.160 --> 18:54.524
How about that?

18:55.760 --> 18:58.000
Thank you so much.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.039
Anybody for a donkey ride?

19:22.040 --> 19:26.040
We mustn't forget the donkey rides,
everyone!

19:30.200 --> 19:33.159
Wonderful animals, donkeys.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.239
Absolutely.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.919
And the champagne today
is really quite excellent.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.119
Yes, of course,
you're a connoisseur.

19:41.120 --> 19:44.319
How's business, Mr Petrukhin?

19:44.320 --> 19:46.519
Very promising at the moment.

19:46.520 --> 19:50.639
Good. And the bellboy
machine, you know,

19:50.640 --> 19:53.519
the one that's like a portable
bellboy...!

19:53.520 --> 19:55.479
Are the orders pouring in?

19:55.480 --> 19:57.879
- They're about to be, yes.
- Good!

19:57.880 --> 20:00.790
And who are the lucky customers?

20:02.280 --> 20:04.799
Come on,
you can tell me that, can't you?

20:04.800 --> 20:07.619
I might even know some of them.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.159
I can't tell you, no.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.919
I've been sworn to secrecy.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.239
Secrets as well?

20:14.600 --> 20:17.919
What an intriguing fellow you are,
Mr Petrukhin.

20:17.920 --> 20:21.039
You are the future,
there's no doubt about it,

20:21.040 --> 20:24.131
and to be able to keep a secret...

20:24.720 --> 20:27.199
is of course a very good thing.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.559
Come on, gentlemen.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.559
One of you at least
must have a donkey ride.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.239
You're all too afraid
of losing your dignity, aren't you?

20:34.240 --> 20:35.559
Who's going to be the brave one?

20:35.560 --> 20:38.379
I'd be happy to go on a donkey.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.879
Why did I get a clap?

20:44.880 --> 20:47.062
No-one else was clapped!

21:01.000 --> 21:03.799
So we meet again, young man.

21:03.800 --> 21:07.891
And this time
it is you who's eating the cake!

21:08.520 --> 21:11.839
Now, this is Mr Ottley
from the United States.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.359
He's a very important man,

21:13.360 --> 21:15.119
so don't tell anybody you've
met him.

21:15.120 --> 21:19.360
In fact, don't tell anybody he's
here.

21:23.760 --> 21:27.942
Excuse me, sir.
I've got to look for my sister.

21:37.280 --> 21:40.319
It's you, child.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.839
You've discovered me in my lair.

21:42.840 --> 21:47.119
Sometimes one just has to
go and hide on these occasions,

21:47.120 --> 21:49.119
when everyone is being so jolly.

21:49.120 --> 21:54.359
It can be disturbing after a time,
don't you think?

21:57.960 --> 21:59.679
They're funny pictures, aren't they?

21:59.680 --> 22:01.799
I saw them before.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.999
I remember that one especially.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.799
Do you know what it is?
Because I don't.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.039
Maybe a storm?

22:08.040 --> 22:09.479
Maybe a war?

22:09.480 --> 22:11.519
A war? I certainly hope not.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.479
I pray whatever it shows, it's gone.

22:14.480 --> 22:16.839
That it was over some time ago.

22:16.840 --> 22:19.519
You hope so too, don't you?

22:19.520 --> 22:21.000
Yes.

22:22.080 --> 22:25.079
I can't believe
how beautiful this garden is.

22:25.080 --> 22:28.171
You haven't seen the best bit yet.

22:28.320 --> 22:32.359
It's my dream to make the garden
as surprising as I can,

22:32.360 --> 22:34.439
more than any other garden
I've seen.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.639
Well, it's already pretty
surprising.

22:36.640 --> 22:40.319
Certainly compared to
the gardens around us!

22:40.320 --> 22:43.919
- But you know that, Mr Petrukhin...
- Samuel, please.

22:43.920 --> 22:48.359
Well, you know, Samuel,
you can come here whenever you want.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.639
You and your family.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.559
Come here whenever I want?

22:51.560 --> 22:53.439
Yes.

22:53.440 --> 22:58.350
- You can't mean that.
- Yes, I do mean it. Absolutely.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.582
I want this garden used.

23:07.360 --> 23:10.079
Attention, everyone, please!

23:10.080 --> 23:11.839
Attention over here, please!

23:11.840 --> 23:14.719
Now we must welcome somebody.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.759
We are very privileged
that my Aunt Mary,

23:17.760 --> 23:20.639
who most of you know,
is with us up here.

23:20.640 --> 23:24.159
And I must warn you,
she can hear what you're saying now!

23:24.160 --> 23:26.359
I most certainly can.

23:26.360 --> 23:29.999
Aunt Mary is going to present
the result of the first raffle.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.919
And the prizes are more splendid
this year than they have ever been,

23:33.920 --> 23:37.284
so let's have a fanfare for
Aunt Mary.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.959
This must be the perfect place
to come

23:41.960 --> 23:44.119
when you want to get away from
everything.

23:44.120 --> 23:46.639
Come and escape all worries.

23:46.640 --> 23:47.960
Yes, it is.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.804
If I ever need to do that.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.342
I'm sure you never need to do that!

23:55.680 --> 23:58.439
I, on the other hand,
have to worry about business.

23:58.440 --> 24:01.479
I'm always staring at the phone,
waiting for orders to come through.

24:01.480 --> 24:03.039
Yes, it must be hard.

24:03.040 --> 24:05.919
Waiting for the world
to catch on to your idea.

24:05.920 --> 24:07.480
It is.

24:09.120 --> 24:13.399
But wonderful, to know you're
the first.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.855
That's a very good thought.

24:17.120 --> 24:20.302
I must remember that you said that.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.999
And now I have an invitation
for you -

24:23.000 --> 24:24.359
you must come to a demonstration

24:24.360 --> 24:26.039
that I'm going to do of the
staff locator

24:26.040 --> 24:28.959
for some very important people.
It's not quite top secret,

24:28.960 --> 24:31.759
- but it's pretty secret.
- Will I be allowed,

24:31.760 --> 24:33.639
if it's all hush-hush? Yes,

24:33.640 --> 24:35.919
because I'm not going to ask
anyone's permission.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.399
You'll be part of my official team!

24:38.400 --> 24:39.759
Please come.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.239
I need to make sure that I have
an appreciative audience.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.513
51!

24:45.360 --> 24:48.519
That's number 51!

24:48.520 --> 24:50.599
Where's number 51?

24:50.600 --> 24:52.119
Come on, where are you?

24:52.120 --> 24:54.999
This is for second prize!

24:55.000 --> 24:57.359
Number 51.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.679
Where've you gone?

24:58.680 --> 25:01.439
My goodness. I think that's me!

25:01.440 --> 25:03.360
It's me! I...

25:05.920 --> 25:07.880
Sorry, everyone.

25:09.240 --> 25:12.599
And you've won a crate of champagne!

25:12.600 --> 25:15.439
I'm so sorry, it's me!

25:15.440 --> 25:18.279
This is the first time
I've ever won anything

25:18.280 --> 25:22.190
since the egg and spoon race
when I was six!

25:22.920 --> 25:27.648
And now to the top prize
for this raffle, which is...

25:30.840 --> 25:33.959
a magnificent radio
and gramophone set,

25:33.960 --> 25:35.239
the latest model,

25:35.240 --> 25:38.799
with a collection
of 50 long-playing records.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.319
And now I'm delighted to say

25:41.320 --> 25:47.320
that Lord Wallington is going to
draw the number for the top prize.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.479
Give them a good shake
in that bucket, Richard -

25:53.480 --> 25:58.753
a really vigorous shake,
so we can get a surprising winner!

25:58.840 --> 26:02.399
Number... 89.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.320
It's number 89.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.519
I'm afraid to say it's me again.

26:08.520 --> 26:11.079
It's you again!

26:11.080 --> 26:14.359
We will need a special removal van

26:14.360 --> 26:17.997
to take all this gentleman's
prizes home.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.799
Thank you so much.

26:20.800 --> 26:25.719
Now, the food is only half-eaten,
so everybody must gorge

26:25.720 --> 26:28.719
and guzzle until the next raffle.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.199
Richard - the treasure hunt.
Treasure hunt!

26:31.200 --> 26:32.999
Yes, of course, how could
I forget?

26:33.000 --> 26:35.039
And we have the treasure hunt
starting right now,

26:35.040 --> 26:36.999
which should take you over
the whole garden.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.039
There are treasure maps here,
so come and get your treasure maps.

26:40.040 --> 26:42.719
Follow the arrows, find the clues,

26:42.720 --> 26:44.799
and somebody
will discover the treasure.

26:44.800 --> 26:49.079
And he - he's the gentleman to beat!

27:01.040 --> 27:03.859
I knew there was something odd.

27:04.360 --> 27:08.088
I knew there was something
strange, Sasha.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.695
There are no children here.

27:12.440 --> 27:16.986
There are no children at all
apart from you, Sasha.

27:17.360 --> 27:22.088
I'm so sorry, Mrs Shaw,
I thought you were Sasha.

27:23.120 --> 27:26.679
He's the only child here,
and I was just wondering...

27:26.680 --> 27:29.135
Why there were no children?

27:29.280 --> 27:31.479
Donkey rides and no children?

27:31.480 --> 27:32.840
Yes.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.960
Yes, it's odd, isn't it?

27:38.520 --> 27:40.239
There used to be.

27:40.240 --> 27:43.879
People brought their children,
there used to be plenty here.

27:43.880 --> 27:48.335
But it's become so ridiculously
grand, our fete...

27:49.120 --> 27:52.799
people must think it would spoil
it if they brought their children.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.710
Which isn't right at all, is it?

27:57.280 --> 27:58.760
Excuse me.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.119
There he is.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.960
Our little party is complete.

28:30.800 --> 28:36.479
We're going to send these two
officers off

28:36.480 --> 28:40.299
with their staff locators
in their pockets.

28:41.000 --> 28:44.479
They will go anywhere they like
on this part of the base,

28:44.480 --> 28:45.879
and we will find them.

28:45.880 --> 28:48.399
And, to just make things more
difficult,

28:48.400 --> 28:53.279
I will utilise a third person -
my son.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.079
Why am I using him?

28:55.080 --> 28:57.959
Because he may choose to go
somewhere that these officers

28:57.960 --> 29:00.519
might not even think of.
And he will,

29:00.520 --> 29:04.839
definitely, under no circumstances,
return here

29:04.840 --> 29:08.119
unless his staff locator goes off.

29:08.120 --> 29:10.840
So, gentlemen, off you go.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.560
And go, Sasha Petrukhin!

29:16.440 --> 29:21.439
Now, gentlemen,
to call the officers, I will dial 9.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.719
To call the boy I will dial 5.

29:23.720 --> 29:27.357
Who's going to be first?
You must choose.

29:35.080 --> 29:38.520
- It's the boy.
- It is the boy.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.319
Keep your distance.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.230
Don't get in the way!

31:04.640 --> 31:06.959
Bull's-eye, I think!

31:06.960 --> 31:10.279
I didn't expect applause...

31:10.280 --> 31:12.479
but maybe some reaction?

31:28.880 --> 31:32.079
Hannah, what are you doing here?
You're missing the demonstration.

31:32.080 --> 31:34.359
I just wanted to make sure
you were all right, Mrs Shaw.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.479
- I've got things to do. Dalton!
- Can I come with you?

31:37.480 --> 31:42.208
To the railway station?
I have to get back into town.

31:45.120 --> 31:48.039
I shouldn't have done that.
Given you this lift.

31:48.040 --> 31:49.839
Your father will wonder where
you've gone.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.079
No, he won't.
I told him I had to go.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.439
I think that's a lie, Hannah.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.759
He was far too busy
with his demonstration.

31:56.760 --> 32:01.079
Somebody will have seen me leave,
seen me run after you.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.599
And why did you run after me?

32:02.600 --> 32:04.782
Because you were crying.

32:06.200 --> 32:12.291
And I wondered why you were crying
seeing Sasha run back towards us.

32:15.400 --> 32:19.310
Stop the car, Dalton.
I need some fresh air.

32:32.120 --> 32:33.799
Mrs Shaw.

32:33.800 --> 32:38.710
Forgive me, because it's nothing
to do with me, really.

32:39.680 --> 32:42.000
But did you lose a child?

32:44.520 --> 32:49.157
I'm so sorry - I probably
shouldn't have asked that.

32:50.600 --> 32:54.510
I had no right to ask, Mrs Shaw,
forgive me.

32:57.680 --> 33:01.319
My son, Anthony, disappeared two
days after his 21st birthday

33:01.320 --> 33:03.599
and nobody's seen
or heard of him since.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.279
He disappeared?

33:05.280 --> 33:07.639
No-one knows if he's alive.

33:07.640 --> 33:09.719
No-one knows what happened.

33:09.720 --> 33:11.811
This is five years ago.

33:12.880 --> 33:15.319
I can hardly bear to say it. It's...

33:15.320 --> 33:16.560
I'm so sorry.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.399
And the police?

33:19.400 --> 33:24.199
The police have drawn
a complete blank. Given up long ago.

33:24.200 --> 33:26.880
He just vanished, our son.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.919
None of his friends,
none of their parents,

33:31.920 --> 33:35.359
nobody has been able to shed
any light on what happened.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.119
I'm so sorry.

33:37.120 --> 33:40.639
Of course, every moment of every
day, I'm thinking about it,

33:40.640 --> 33:43.199
somehow I'm thinking about him.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.655
Even if I seem very busy...

33:47.040 --> 33:49.999
the sense of loss is always there.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.199
The questions.

33:51.200 --> 33:55.679
And sometimes I forget
for half an hour or so,

33:55.680 --> 33:57.559
and then it all comes rushing back

33:57.560 --> 34:01.839
and I feel awful
that I forgot about it for so long.

34:01.840 --> 34:06.199
One doesn't like to share that
with the outside world.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.199
One has to keep going.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.879
My dear, you're in bed
very early tonight.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.119
I am.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.518
- And I have a party tomorrow.
- Of course you do.

34:22.520 --> 34:23.918
The demonstration.

34:23.920 --> 34:25.679
I was so glad I was there.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.639
It was a marvellous success,
wasn't it, Dad?

34:27.639 --> 34:29.159
It was.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.725
Do they have nuclear missiles
at that base, do you think?

34:33.726 --> 34:34.279
No.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.359
They wouldn't let us be there
if there were.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.719
You suddenly left
without saying goodbye.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.359
I know.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.399
I had a chance to get a lift
with Mrs Shaw.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.958
- I needed to get back here early.
- I see.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.199
And how was she?

34:47.199 --> 34:49.079
How was she?

34:49.080 --> 34:51.518
Fine.

34:51.520 --> 34:54.065
She loved the demonstration.

34:56.760 --> 34:59.942
I'm late, I'm late,
I'm always late!

35:18.320 --> 35:19.593
There you are!

35:21.800 --> 35:24.839
Why am I suddenly so interesting
to everybody?

35:24.840 --> 35:28.199
Because you're the girl
that was late for the Queen.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.837
The girl that was locked out.

35:32.120 --> 35:34.080
Is that who I am?

35:40.640 --> 35:44.279
It's one of those days,
isn't it, darling?

35:44.280 --> 35:47.553
When it seems worse. When it just...

35:48.320 --> 35:52.759
- comes into your head...
- Please don't tell me what I'm feeling.

35:52.760 --> 35:55.079
I'm going back today.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.279
Going back where?

35:56.280 --> 35:59.279
- To Mr Spearman.
- To Spearman?

35:59.280 --> 36:01.959
But if there'd been anything
to tell us

36:01.960 --> 36:04.279
he would've been in touch,
of course he would!

36:04.280 --> 36:06.599
Obviously, but I'm still going
to see him.

36:06.600 --> 36:09.328
I don't want him to upset you.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.906
Make it even more difficult.

36:14.040 --> 36:19.677
You've been so marvellous recently,
at the fete and everything.

36:19.680 --> 36:22.439
I know it's always there underneath.

36:22.440 --> 36:25.399
You don't think I feel that, too?

36:25.400 --> 36:28.439
Think about him all the time?
Of course I do.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.599
I've lost count of the amount of
times I've done this

36:30.600 --> 36:33.479
because I've seen a young man
in the street that could be him.

36:33.480 --> 36:37.571
- Stop the car, Dalton.
- Why are we stopping?

36:40.120 --> 36:42.575
But when there's no news...

36:43.880 --> 36:46.079
there is no news, darling.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.359
When we get to London, when you get
out at the House of Commons,

36:49.360 --> 36:51.997
I'm going to take the car on.

37:14.360 --> 37:18.997
Mrs Shaw! You should've let me
know you were coming.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.879
I'm afraid I've nothing to report.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.239
Nothing, I know.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.639
I just wanted to see you again,
in case together we could

37:26.640 --> 37:28.999
- think of another avenue.
- There's always a new idea,

37:29.000 --> 37:31.039
Mrs Shaw, of course.

37:31.040 --> 37:33.320
But I haven't been idle.

37:34.440 --> 37:39.199
Telephone calls I've made this
month, sites I've visited.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.119
Hostels all over London.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.800
Homosexual clubs.

37:44.240 --> 37:46.039
I've even made some visits to places

37:46.040 --> 37:49.199
that meant a lot to him
in his childhood.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.279
Like the toy department in Harrods.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.280
I left them his photo.

37:55.720 --> 37:58.539
Don't worry. I won't take that.

38:02.520 --> 38:05.039
My secretary is ill today.

38:05.040 --> 38:09.599
I've done the same. Those kind
of visits to places he liked.

38:09.600 --> 38:13.199
They get less and less likely
with each year, of course.

38:13.200 --> 38:16.479
I even went to a beach in Sussex
I took him to when he was seven,

38:16.480 --> 38:18.839
which he particularly loved.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.839
As if there would be any sign
on a beach.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.079
Everything's worth trying.

38:22.080 --> 38:23.919
I've even been
thinking of publicity again.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.959
We never went to the newspapers
because of Richard's position, of course.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.239
It's never too late for the
newspapers,

38:29.240 --> 38:32.422
given that Mr Shaw is quite famous.

38:35.680 --> 38:40.119
This week, I've been going over and
over his last meal with us.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.719
I've done it so many times before,

38:41.720 --> 38:46.159
but this week I've done it more
intensely than I've ever done.

38:46.160 --> 38:49.759
The last meal we had together -
the last time I saw him.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.879
I'm seeing if I can get any clue,

38:51.880 --> 38:56.159
any clue at all of what might've
happened from that meal.

38:56.160 --> 39:00.279
He was just eating, and then -
I think about this bit so often -

39:00.280 --> 39:04.599
he puts his chair back at the table,
so carefully.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.419
So neat and perfect.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.199
And then he went into the room
next door

39:09.200 --> 39:11.119
and played some records
on the gramophone.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.679
And I try so hard,

39:13.680 --> 39:16.119
I try so hard,

39:16.120 --> 39:18.719
to see if the record he's playing
will tell me anything.

39:18.720 --> 39:20.902
If I can read the label.

39:24.920 --> 39:27.439
But I can't really remember
which one he played.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.622
It was just dance music.

39:32.520 --> 39:35.157
It was such an ordinary meal.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.950
Such an ordinary day.

39:39.680 --> 39:42.839
Every memory I have of him,
I replay.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.639
And it's as if what happens now,
what happens day-to-day now,

39:45.640 --> 39:47.839
I don't want to remember any of it.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.479
I don't want it to stay with me,

39:49.480 --> 39:52.239
so that it doesn't get in the way
of what I have to remember.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.719
It makes perfect sense.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.439
What does?
Replaying the meal over and over again.

39:56.440 --> 40:00.639
But do you know what also makes
perfect sense to me?

40:00.640 --> 40:04.479
You calling all his friends again,
and all the parents...

40:04.480 --> 40:06.719
But you do that every few weeks,
don't you?

40:06.720 --> 40:09.039
And you go and see them, too -
at least, I hope you do.

40:09.040 --> 40:12.079
- That's why we're...
- That's why you're paying me. Yes.

40:12.080 --> 40:16.199
But they don't like talking
to a fat private detective.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.439
They don't like taking
my telephone calls either.

40:18.440 --> 40:21.959
Well, they hate me calling,
and I've called and called them.

40:21.960 --> 40:24.879
Because they have nothing to tell
me, and that makes them feel guilty.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.319
Mrs Shaw...

40:27.720 --> 40:30.175
never stop calling them.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.079
Hannah!

40:50.800 --> 40:52.479
They all look quite normal.

40:52.480 --> 40:56.039
I didn't know who'd be crazy enough
to volunteer to be nuclear victims!

40:56.040 --> 40:59.239
- So you think I'm crazy, then?
- No, no, of course not!

40:59.240 --> 41:02.639
You're doing it because you're a
writer, to get material,

41:02.640 --> 41:04.319
get an exciting book out of it.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.879
And to get a free apple, of course.

41:05.880 --> 41:11.039
You are here to help
train our emergency personnel

41:11.040 --> 41:14.719
in the unlikely event
of a nuclear attack...

41:14.720 --> 41:18.559
All that red area?
Is that what one bomb would do?

41:18.560 --> 41:19.919
At least.

41:19.920 --> 41:24.399
But I feel our little exercise
will be somewhat smaller.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.159
That's very frightening.

41:26.160 --> 41:29.359
Now, our exercise will be
carried out

41:29.360 --> 41:32.839
in six London streets
simultaneously.

41:32.840 --> 41:35.959
You will be in one of those streets.

41:35.960 --> 41:39.919
The area will be evacuated
and cordoned off.

41:39.920 --> 41:44.080
Now, take a moment to study
this map.

41:45.280 --> 41:48.959
Hannah, you don't need to do this.

41:48.960 --> 41:53.559
Maybe you should ask someone else
if it's a good idea.

41:53.560 --> 41:55.719
Get a second opinion.

42:02.040 --> 42:05.950
No, no. I've come to see you,
not my father.

42:10.080 --> 42:15.444
When we met before, I very rudely
never asked you your name.

42:22.360 --> 42:24.799
So, Esther,

42:24.800 --> 42:27.759
I know I can't do sign language
and I talk too quickly,

42:27.760 --> 42:32.039
and I look away all the time,
which must be infuriating.

42:32.040 --> 42:35.159
But would you like to meet
for a cup of coffee at the weekend?

42:35.160 --> 42:36.615
Just you and me?

42:40.360 --> 42:42.079
Hello, can I talk to Lady Ledbury,
please?

42:42.080 --> 42:44.279
- Who's speaking?
- It's Kathleen Shaw.

42:44.280 --> 42:46.008
One moment, please.

42:53.360 --> 42:56.759
- Mrs Shaw?
- Hello, Celia, I was just calling...

42:56.760 --> 43:00.079
I'm afraid I have absolutely
no news for you, Mrs Shaw.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.079
Of course I would be in touch
if there was.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.519
Yes, I realise.

43:03.520 --> 43:07.199
I just wondered if there was any
chance of talking to Paul,

43:07.200 --> 43:10.399
because he and Anthony
spent so much time together.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.399
Paul's not there with you now,
by any chance?

43:12.400 --> 43:14.559
No, he's not,
he's in the south of France.

43:14.560 --> 43:17.399
Of course if he knew anything
he would've said so immediately,

43:17.400 --> 43:20.039
or if he had heard
anything from his friends.

43:20.040 --> 43:22.479
I know you must understand that,
Mrs Shaw.

43:22.480 --> 43:24.119
Yes, I do.

43:24.120 --> 43:26.879
But I wonder if it would be
possible to see Paul,

43:26.880 --> 43:28.759
or talk to him on the phone,

43:28.760 --> 43:31.359
just in case he jogs my memory
about something.

43:31.360 --> 43:32.759
I will ask him, of course,

43:32.760 --> 43:35.039
but I'm quite sure Paul
has nothing to add.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.359
But you will ask him?

43:36.360 --> 43:39.997
I will, on his return.
Goodbye, Mrs Shaw.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.239
I'm sorry I'm late!

43:49.240 --> 43:52.604
It just keeps happening
at the moment.

43:58.360 --> 44:02.159
After our walk, I'm going to take
you out to lunch, Esther.

44:02.160 --> 44:03.679
Because I need your advice.

44:03.680 --> 44:05.319
OK...

44:05.320 --> 44:07.559
I'll ask you now, then.

44:07.560 --> 44:10.519
So, I know this man, who's a writer.

44:10.520 --> 44:11.959
He's not a boyfriend, no,

44:11.960 --> 44:14.599
but he's asked me to do
something very strange.

44:14.600 --> 44:18.239
Play a survivor -
well, I hope it's a survivor! -

44:18.240 --> 44:21.439
of a nuclear attack
in a Civil Defence exercise.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.399
They need volunteers.

44:23.400 --> 44:26.199
And of course it's the same day
as an important party

44:26.200 --> 44:28.039
which I shouldn't miss, but I will,

44:28.040 --> 44:33.586
because I have no idea how long
nuclear attacks normally last.

44:34.160 --> 44:38.342
And I sort of want to go to it,
the exercise...

44:38.480 --> 44:41.662
although I'm not quite sure why.

44:42.200 --> 44:45.119
I can't get into any more trouble,
you know,

44:45.120 --> 44:49.479
not being at the party,
because I missed the Queen, Esther!

44:49.480 --> 44:52.719
I was late and got locked out.

44:52.720 --> 44:56.720
And I've had to lie to my
parents ever since.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.448
What are you doing?

45:17.080 --> 45:19.999
Darling Sashenka, how are you?

45:20.000 --> 45:22.879
You sound very happy in your letters
to Mum and Dad.

45:22.880 --> 45:25.399
I, on the other hand,
have done something very bad,

45:25.400 --> 45:28.079
which I can't tell you about yet.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.559
I also have the most extraordinary
day coming up,

45:30.560 --> 45:36.015
which I will tell you about,
but Mum and Dad must never know.

45:36.960 --> 45:39.919
- Name?
- Hannah Petrukhin.

45:39.920 --> 45:41.200
Dead or alive?

45:42.640 --> 45:45.239
I hope I'm alive, that I
get to live!

45:45.240 --> 45:47.959
If I have a choice,
I'll go for that, please.

45:47.960 --> 45:49.599
Haven't you been told?

45:49.600 --> 45:50.759
No.

45:50.760 --> 45:52.999
Nobody said whether I lived or died.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.199
Next room, that way.

45:55.200 --> 45:58.291
Not many people get to live, dear.

46:05.920 --> 46:09.920
- Good evening, Mr Petrukhin.
- Good evening.

46:10.960 --> 46:13.324
Take a seat, Mr Petrukhin.

46:19.360 --> 46:22.360
Should I tell them that I'm here?

46:22.560 --> 46:25.833
They know you're here, Mr Petrukhin.

46:43.680 --> 46:45.359
I know this is a silly question -

46:45.360 --> 46:49.119
well, I hope it's a silly question -

46:49.120 --> 46:52.319
but you are stopping at the face
and arms, aren't you?

46:52.320 --> 46:53.839
Not doing the whole body?

46:53.840 --> 46:55.559
Old clothes.

46:55.560 --> 47:00.639
I hope everybody is wearing old
clothes like you were told,

47:00.640 --> 47:03.759
because you won't be able
to wear those again.

47:03.760 --> 47:08.670
I'm sacrificing this dress, yes,
for Queen and country.

47:11.320 --> 47:14.079
I'm meant to be going to a
party later.

47:14.080 --> 47:19.444
Not sure that's going to happen,
somehow. What do you think?

47:34.720 --> 47:37.811
Sorry I'm a little late, everyone.

47:38.280 --> 47:40.359
Forgive me!

47:41.880 --> 47:45.699
I just worked out why I'm here,
that's all.

47:46.520 --> 47:49.319
I'm in the wrong room, apparently.

47:49.320 --> 47:50.866
I think I'm dead!

47:52.440 --> 47:55.119
Those that don't die instantly
are being made up.

47:55.120 --> 47:57.359
You survive!

47:57.360 --> 47:58.559
For a bit anyway!

47:58.560 --> 48:00.479
Wrong room.

48:00.480 --> 48:03.753
But I'll make sure I'm dead
near you.

48:06.960 --> 48:12.239
- Mr Petrukhin, good afternoon.
- Well, it's actually more like evening!

48:12.240 --> 48:13.999
I hope you have some news for me.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.637
We do. We're just going down
the passage.

48:18.720 --> 48:20.079
We're going into an office

48:20.080 --> 48:22.319
you haven't been in before,
Mr Petrukhin.

48:22.320 --> 48:24.957
And then we're having dinner?

48:45.000 --> 48:46.919
What on earth is this?

48:46.920 --> 48:49.557
Yes, your whole life is here.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.279
This is my father.

48:54.280 --> 48:56.099
Just before he died.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.239
How did you get this photo?

48:59.240 --> 49:00.679
We took them all.

49:00.680 --> 49:03.919
- Why?
- Why do you think, Mr Petrukhin?

49:03.920 --> 49:06.319
I know that you've been following
me these past few weeks,

49:06.320 --> 49:07.957
but I had no idea.

49:09.680 --> 49:12.439
I didn't realise that you'd been
doing this for years!

49:12.440 --> 49:15.279
Various different people have
been following you, Mr Petrukhin,

49:15.280 --> 49:17.359
because you are so extremely
interesting to us.

49:17.360 --> 49:22.039
You're Russian, your father had
dealings with the Soviet Trade Delegation

49:22.040 --> 49:25.439
and you were servicing Winston Churchill's
hearing aid when he was Prime Minister.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.679
- These are all reasons...
- So you really believed we were

49:27.680 --> 49:29.159
bugging Churchill's hearing aid?

49:29.160 --> 49:31.839
Yes. We had to make sure you
weren't.

49:31.840 --> 49:33.319
It's mad!

49:33.320 --> 49:34.839
You do realise how mad it is?

49:34.840 --> 49:37.840
We believe you now, Mr Petrukhin.

49:39.360 --> 49:41.724
Take a seat, Mr Petrukhin.

49:44.800 --> 49:47.919
We have to attend to another matter
but we'll be back.

49:47.920 --> 49:50.279
We have something to ask you,
Mr Petrukhin.

49:50.280 --> 49:53.008
Something we'd like you to do.

49:54.200 --> 49:56.655
And you lock me in, do you?

50:04.880 --> 50:07.239
Out, out, out, out!

50:08.400 --> 50:10.128
You heard her! Out!

50:14.640 --> 50:17.319
Come on, come on! Everyone out!

50:17.320 --> 50:19.199
Get out!

50:19.200 --> 50:20.679
Come on, come on!

50:20.680 --> 50:23.879
Those designated
as survivors, do not move!

50:23.880 --> 50:25.160
Come on!

50:26.880 --> 50:30.439
Everybody down.
That includes you, miss! Down!

50:30.440 --> 50:32.200
Get down!

50:48.840 --> 50:50.800
Get down!

50:53.560 --> 50:55.039
You're breaking the rules, Hannah.

50:55.040 --> 50:57.559
You're not meant to be dead.
You're meant to be back there.

50:57.560 --> 50:59.359
Maybe we both get to survive.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.599
Just to remind you,

51:01.600 --> 51:07.359
under no circumstances is anybody
to look up until the signal.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.919
What on earth are you up to?

51:43.920 --> 51:46.119
Why do you think
that you can lock me in?

51:46.120 --> 51:49.480
We have a request, Mr Petrukhin.

51:50.600 --> 51:52.639
We want you to do something for us.

51:52.640 --> 51:57.079
These are your new friends,
are they not?

51:57.080 --> 51:58.999
Mr and Mrs Shaw?

51:59.000 --> 52:02.079
They have been very generous
to me and my family, yes.

52:02.080 --> 52:04.679
We want to make
use of your new friendship.

52:04.680 --> 52:07.919
We want you to accept every
invitation

52:07.920 --> 52:10.199
you receive to visit them.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.239
And they entertain all the time.

52:12.240 --> 52:16.599
We want you to notice everything
that goes on in that house.

52:16.600 --> 52:19.399
We want to find out about
other guests you meet.

52:19.400 --> 52:21.159
You want me to spy on this family?

52:21.160 --> 52:24.479
You're asking me to spy on my
friends?

52:24.480 --> 52:26.719
Yes.

52:26.720 --> 52:30.679
Well, I'm not going to do it.
Nothing would make me agree to that!

52:30.680 --> 52:32.759
I am not a spy.

52:32.760 --> 52:34.999
We think you're ideal, Mr Petrukhin.

52:35.000 --> 52:38.959
It's very difficult for us to get
access to that house and garden.

52:38.960 --> 52:41.279
That's why you're perfect,
Mr Petrukhin.

52:41.280 --> 52:45.559
What conceivable reason could there
be for a war hero and his wife

52:45.560 --> 52:47.039
to be of interest to you?

52:47.040 --> 52:50.039
That is why we need your help,
Mr Petrukhin, to find that out.

52:50.040 --> 52:53.479
It's best you know nothing at all,
to keep you safe.

52:53.480 --> 52:56.279
I absolutely will not do it.

52:56.280 --> 52:58.799
I like these people enormously.

52:58.800 --> 53:02.039
I will categorically not do
what you ask.

53:02.040 --> 53:03.919
I think you will, Mr Petrukhin.

53:03.920 --> 53:05.559
In fact, I know you will.

53:05.560 --> 53:09.759
Your business and your family's
wellbeing depend upon it.

53:09.760 --> 53:14.999
If you do this,
you will get at least some orders

53:15.000 --> 53:16.599
from the Government

53:16.600 --> 53:18.439
for your staff locator.

53:18.440 --> 53:20.639
And you have
no other orders for it, do you?

53:20.640 --> 53:21.999
You expect me to believe that?

53:22.000 --> 53:24.728
But you need to help us first.

53:29.160 --> 53:31.679
Go and see what the problem is.

53:31.680 --> 53:33.439
Miss Godwin will have left.

53:33.440 --> 53:35.239
This is horrible.

53:36.400 --> 53:38.879
You're trying to give me
an impossible choice.

53:38.880 --> 53:42.279
No, I'm not sure it's even a choice,
Mr Petrukhin.

53:42.280 --> 53:46.759
This way,
your firm avoids bankruptcy.

53:46.760 --> 53:48.959
Your future is secure.

53:48.960 --> 53:50.919
Look, why don't we say this?

53:50.920 --> 53:55.159
You go and do it for us once
and see what happens.

53:55.160 --> 53:58.119
Go there for a single evening,
into that house,

53:58.120 --> 53:59.919
keeping your ears peeled.

53:59.920 --> 54:02.119
You want me to become
your bugging device?

54:02.120 --> 54:03.200
In a way.

54:04.600 --> 54:07.873
It is for your country,
Mr Petrukhin.

54:09.080 --> 54:11.239
For Queen and country.

54:25.000 --> 54:28.000
Go to the room with the red door.

54:29.360 --> 54:32.360
Go to the room with the red door.

54:41.800 --> 54:43.760
Where's the red door?

54:45.160 --> 54:47.120
What red door?

54:58.800 --> 55:02.528
I wouldn't go in there
if I was you, miss.

55:24.760 --> 55:26.079
Miss!

55:26.080 --> 55:28.519
Where are you going?
You're not a survivor!

55:28.520 --> 55:30.319
You should have gone through
the red door.

55:30.320 --> 55:32.439
The numbers will be all wrong now.
Go back!

55:32.440 --> 55:33.839
I'm not coming back!

55:33.840 --> 55:36.319
You can't go like that,
you'll frighten people! Come back!

55:36.320 --> 55:38.999
People outside cannot see you
like that!

55:39.000 --> 55:43.279
- I'm going!
- It's forbidden, absolutely forbidden!

55:43.280 --> 55:44.719
Wait.

55:44.720 --> 55:46.079
Wait!

55:46.080 --> 55:48.280
Wait! Stop. Wait for me.

55:54.800 --> 55:57.891
Don't worry, it's just fancy
dress!

55:58.720 --> 56:00.959
You see - it comes off!

56:11.240 --> 56:13.519
You weren't waiting up for me,
were you, Dad?

56:13.520 --> 56:15.339
Where have you been?

56:16.120 --> 56:18.359
I was doing something with a friend.

56:18.360 --> 56:20.719
I thought you had a party tonight.

56:20.720 --> 56:22.959
It was cancelled.

56:22.960 --> 56:24.479
We went bowling instead.

56:24.480 --> 56:25.760
Bowling?

56:27.920 --> 56:30.011
Are you all right, Dad?

56:30.360 --> 56:34.451
I just couldn't sleep.
Nothing to worry about.

56:34.480 --> 56:36.935
Everything's under control.

56:52.400 --> 56:55.279
It's an invitation
from Mr and Mrs Shaw

56:55.280 --> 56:59.799
to attend a musical evening at their
house next week.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.619
Well, I'm not going.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.399
- But you must, my dear.
- I must?

57:04.400 --> 57:06.959
What do you mean, I must?
I'm certainly not going?

57:06.960 --> 57:09.359
That fete was ridiculous.
Everybody dressed up like that!

57:09.360 --> 57:12.815
I'm definitely not going to
them again.

57:14.160 --> 57:15.919
Please, you must come.

57:15.920 --> 57:17.120
No.

57:18.840 --> 57:21.079
But you go, my dear.

57:21.080 --> 57:22.679
I know it means a lot to you,

57:22.680 --> 57:25.159
being entertained in a
beautiful house.

57:25.160 --> 57:26.800
You must go.

57:57.440 --> 58:01.239
I don't think I've ever seen a room
