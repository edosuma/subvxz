00:01.102 --> 00:02.236
(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:02.270 --> 00:06.174
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.509
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.542 --> 00:10.511
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.544 --> 00:12.146
are members of
an elite squad

00:12.180 --> 00:13.814
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.847 --> 00:16.150
These are their stories.

00:18.819 --> 00:23.324
Slow down, sugar.
I got somethin' for you.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.093
Hey, handsome.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.094
How you doin' tonight?

00:26.127 --> 00:27.361
I'm fine.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.829
[giggles]
What's your name, honey?

00:28.862 --> 00:29.830
Lawrence.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.632
I'm Vegas.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.701
I've never
done this before.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.203
Don't worry, baby.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.538
Whatever happens in Vegas...

00:37.571 --> 00:39.240
stays in Vegas.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.241
[mechanical noise]

00:40.274 --> 00:41.709
What the hell was that?

00:41.742 --> 00:45.779
It better not be some bitch
workin' my stroll!

00:45.813 --> 00:47.381
What the hell
are you doin'?

00:47.415 --> 00:49.317
[clank]

00:49.350 --> 00:50.684
Yeah, you better run!

00:50.718 --> 00:53.821
I say who gets their pole
smoked on my block!

00:53.854 --> 00:55.523
[tires screech]

00:59.860 --> 01:02.130
(Bamford)
Rape-homicide.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.764
Skimpy clothes all torn up.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.866
Dumped under a grate
on a lovers lane.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.168
Probably a pross.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.436
Who called it in?
Vegas here.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.104
Friendly
neighborhood hooker.

01:10.138 --> 01:12.673
She didn't see the guy's face
or the plates on his SUV.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.108
Vegas ever see
the girl?

01:14.142 --> 01:15.776
Nah, but she said there's
a lot of fresh meat

01:15.809 --> 01:17.211
working this track.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.513
Didn't find Jane Doe's wallet
or a purse.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.249
Any DNA?

01:21.282 --> 01:22.650
No visible fluids,

01:22.683 --> 01:25.419
but she's got something
under her fingernails.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.255
(Benson)
Fingertips are pretty torn up.
Is that blood?

01:27.288 --> 01:28.589
Red paint.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.724
But I don't see anything
around here that color.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.460
Must be from
where she was killed.

01:32.493 --> 01:35.496
Got handprint bruising
on both sides of her neck.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.231
Any idea when
she was strangled?

01:37.265 --> 01:39.900
Given the lividity,
I'd say midnight, maybe 12:30.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.204
He wasn't dumping this girl.
He was trying to bury her.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.739
Maybe somebody she knew?
Repeat customer?

01:45.773 --> 01:48.509
(Siper)
Detectives!
Found her purse down there.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.611
We got lipstick,
perfume,

01:50.644 --> 01:52.646
breath mints,
condoms.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.548
Working girl's
overnight bag?

01:54.582 --> 01:55.649
No driver's license.

01:55.683 --> 01:56.917
But we got a college I.D.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.254
Hudson University.
Her name's Caroline Pereira.

02:00.288 --> 02:01.789
Cell phone
in the purse too.

02:01.822 --> 02:02.823
Any recent calls?

02:02.856 --> 02:05.193
Last one's from 11:15
this evening.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.794
Number's blocked.
I'll run the LUDS.

02:06.827 --> 02:11.299
But someone also used
this phone's camera.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.500
Is that human?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.368
Looks like a person to me.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.703
Shot at 12:07 a.m.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.571
Warner said the time of death
was around midnight.

02:17.605 --> 02:20.341
Maybe Caroline got
a picture of her killer.

03:11.725 --> 03:12.760
(Stabler)
Can you enhance it?

03:12.793 --> 03:14.295
This is the best
we're gonna get.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.564
Cell phones take pictures
at a very low pixel grade.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.866
What's that burst
of light in the corner?

03:18.899 --> 03:20.000
Could be strobing
or a reflection.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.369
No way to tell.

03:21.402 --> 03:22.670
Notified the parents.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.005
They're driving down
from LaGrange to make the I.D.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.807
Man, what a clichÃ©.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.376
Poor kid from a small town

03:28.409 --> 03:30.611
finds a way to make
quick money in the big city.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.313
Wouldn't be the first time
a college girl

03:32.346 --> 03:33.981
flat-backed her way
to a diploma.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.215
Hmm.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.619
(Bursar)
Caroline was on work/study.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.554
She washed dishes
at the cafeteria,

03:40.588 --> 03:42.556
but she quit at the beginning
of this semester.

03:42.590 --> 03:43.957
Don't they have
to keep working

03:43.991 --> 03:45.293
to keep their
financial aid?

03:45.326 --> 03:46.960
A university job's
not required

03:46.994 --> 03:48.362
if the student's bills
get paid.

03:48.396 --> 03:49.730
Who paid them?

03:49.763 --> 03:52.032
Caroline did. In cash.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.034
Where did she get
that kind of money?

03:54.067 --> 03:54.835
Oh, that's
none of our business.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.271
A 20-year-old student
walks in here

03:57.305 --> 03:59.540
with 15 grand in cash,
and you don't bat an eye?

03:59.573 --> 04:02.543
We only ask about the payments
when they don't come in.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.346
You ask about your students when
they don't show up for class?

04:05.379 --> 04:06.880
That's not my department.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.549
Is there anyone else
on this campus

04:08.582 --> 04:10.284
who might know her
a little better than you?

04:10.318 --> 04:15.823
Uh, she has a roommate.
Gloria Culhane.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.825
Caroline and I
never hung out.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.493
Who'd she
hang out with?

04:19.527 --> 04:20.628
I don't really know.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.696
We run in different circles.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.797
I bet.
Nice ring.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.633
Thanks.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.935
I spent last semester
in France.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.437
Forgot to fill out
the housing form.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.938
This is what they
assigned me with.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.806
This Caroline's side
of the room?

04:32.840 --> 04:33.874
Yes.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.075
You're her roommate.

04:35.108 --> 04:35.943
You must know
something about her.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.379
All I really know is
she went out a lot.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.348
I wish I could
tell you where.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.417
She stay out late?

04:43.451 --> 04:45.819
A lot of times she'd come
to class looking like hell.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.388
Whatever she was doing,

04:47.421 --> 04:48.822
she was raking in the dough.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.691
Wow!
Gotta be a thou there.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.559
You know anything
about that?

04:51.592 --> 04:53.461
Well, I doubt it came
from her parents.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.429
They don't have a lot of money.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.731
College girl's got a closet
full of cash,

04:57.765 --> 04:59.967
she's either selling drugs
or herself.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.435
(Fin)
Caroline have a boyfriend?

05:01.469 --> 05:02.836
No.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.105
Who's this?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.374
Oh, that's Adam.

05:06.407 --> 05:07.508
He's not her boyfriend,
though.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.076
They just went
to high school together.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.445
You know where
we can find him?

05:11.479 --> 05:13.581
Probably in class.
He goes here too.

05:13.614 --> 05:14.882
I can't believe it.

05:14.915 --> 05:17.951
Carol and I have been friends
since we were kids.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.689
She has a nice chunk
of change in a shoe box.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.424
Any idea where it
came from?

05:23.457 --> 05:25.092
She said she had
a new job.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.560
Doing what?

05:26.594 --> 05:28.929
She didn't tell me.
Why?

05:28.962 --> 05:32.433
We found her body in
a known prostitute area.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.968
No way.
Carol would never do that.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.871
How does a 20-year-old
bring down that much cash?

05:37.905 --> 05:39.440
I told you.
I don't know.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.842
Well, maybe you can get
some ideas down at the office.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.711
A-a-all right.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.015
She was selling term papers.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.483
I didn't know cheating
could be so dangerous.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.719
School's really
bent out of shape.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.487
They investigating?

05:53.521 --> 05:54.588
Yeah.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.723
Whole thing's being
headed up

05:55.756 --> 05:58.892
by this English professor,
Dr. Farouq.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.494
Plagiarism is an epidemic here.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.430
And the Internet has only
made it easier

06:02.463 --> 06:04.632
for students to buy
and sell academic work.

06:04.665 --> 06:05.999
(Fin)
You catch anyone?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.668
Take a look at this.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.970
I designed a program
that scans students' work

06:10.003 --> 06:12.039
and searches for patterns
of repetition

06:12.072 --> 06:13.607
and unoriginal material.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.108
They e-mail me
their term papers,

06:15.142 --> 06:17.645
and I feed everything
into the program.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.779
Now look here.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.449
Three papers
are being compared.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.617
The fourth window you see
pulls out and itemizes

06:23.651 --> 06:25.118
the content overlap.

06:25.152 --> 06:27.187
The blue highlights show
possible similarities.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.523
The green sections
are very suspect.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.693
And the red passages
are direct matches.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.827
You can prove who's
plagiarizing.

06:33.861 --> 06:34.928
Yes.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.063
But here's the problem.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.598
These three students cheated,

06:37.631 --> 06:39.833
but none of them wrote
the paper of origin.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.569
How do you know two of them
didn't cheat off the third?

06:41.602 --> 06:42.770
None of these three
are capable

06:42.803 --> 06:44.838
of writing
of this caliber.

06:44.872 --> 06:48.476
But...I'll find
the original paper.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.478
And then we'll expel
all the guilty parties.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.646
Caroline Pereira.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.448
Did her name come up
in your investigation?

06:54.482 --> 06:55.683
No.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.518
Caroline took my class
last semester.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.619
Excellent student.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.454
And her work was
wholly original.

07:00.488 --> 07:02.089
She wouldn't have
any reason to cheat.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.992
The kids who handed in
these plagiarized papers,

07:05.025 --> 07:06.994
we're gonna need their names.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.131
The pepperoncini
gives it

07:11.164 --> 07:12.600
this insane bite, dude.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.134
It's key to the power
of the sandwich.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.236
Mark Duffy.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.204
I need to talk to you.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.907
Priya?
Finish this sub for me.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.977
What can I get for you?
Busy today, huh?

07:24.011 --> 07:25.546
[chuckles]

07:25.579 --> 07:27.114
I'm always busy.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.717
Too busy to keep up
with your schoolwork?

07:29.750 --> 07:31.485
What's this about?

07:31.519 --> 07:32.753
Buying term papers.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.022
Man, I bought, like one.

07:35.055 --> 07:36.590
From her?

07:36.624 --> 07:38.692
Yeah.

07:38.726 --> 07:41.662
Dude in my English class
hooked me up with Caroline.

07:41.695 --> 07:44.798
Whoa, is this like, uh,
some big crime now or something?

07:48.301 --> 07:49.703
Am I in trouble?

07:49.737 --> 07:51.772
Not if you cooperate.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.974
How did you arrange
the hand-off?

07:54.007 --> 07:54.908
There was no hand-off.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.109
How'd you get
the paper, then?

07:56.143 --> 07:58.779
You'd e-mail her
the assignment.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.014
Then you'd tell her what kind
of English paper you needed.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.850
And she'd send you back
a couple of samples.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.184
So you'd order, like,
one from Column A,

08:04.217 --> 08:05.886
one from Column B.

08:05.919 --> 08:06.687
Something like that.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.188
You'd only pay
for the one you liked.

08:08.221 --> 08:11.759
In cash?
Online, to a...
paymepronto.com account.

08:11.792 --> 08:12.993
How much she charge?

08:13.026 --> 08:14.862
200 bucks a paper.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.063
That's pretty steep.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.264
I'm pre-med.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.866
I don't have time to read
The Faerie Queene

08:18.899 --> 08:20.200
and write about
the imagery of virtue

08:20.233 --> 08:22.035
for some ridiculous
English requirement.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.737
So you buy the paper
off Caroline?

08:23.771 --> 08:26.574
Everybody wins.

08:26.607 --> 08:27.841
Caroline lost.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.610
She was murdered last night.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.246
I gotta go.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.314
Wait a minute.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.049
Why'd you just
get so spooked?

08:39.286 --> 08:41.121
Because of Brian.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.824
Brian who?
Townsend.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.159
He's in Farouq's
English class too.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.629
He bought a bunch
of papers off Caroline.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.997
When he heard about
the investigation,

08:50.030 --> 08:51.198
he got really nervous.

08:51.231 --> 08:52.966
What does that mean?
"Got nervous"?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.670
He said he was going
to take care of the problem.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.706
Okay, so I bought
a few term papers.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.008
That's an honor code violation,
not a crime.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.710
Murder is.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.612
Caroline was killed
last night.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.715
And we heard you had a problem
you were gonna take care of.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.883
Well, I--I didn't
kill her.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.586
I was gonna...bribe her.

09:12.620 --> 09:14.321
I offered her a grand
to keep quiet.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.756
She take the money?

09:15.789 --> 09:18.025
No, she laughed in my face.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.860
Waved that big freakin'
diamond ring around,

09:19.893 --> 09:22.362
said it'd take more than
a grand to keep her quiet.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.931
That's gotta be the ring
Gloria was wearing.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.298
Gloria?

09:25.332 --> 09:26.366
Caroline's roommate?

09:26.399 --> 09:27.434
You think I'm bad?

09:27.467 --> 09:30.137
Gloria bought more papers
off Caroline than anyone.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.205
She was really freaking out.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.613
(male lecturer)
Today, it's not uncommon
to hear Edmund Husserl

09:39.647 --> 09:43.083
maligned as a naive
positivist.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.953
However, this
is to neglect the impact

09:45.986 --> 09:48.889
his phenomenology had on
the canon of French thought...

09:48.922 --> 09:49.923
Stand up.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.293
Excuse me?

09:53.326 --> 09:54.862
Let's go.
We need to talk.

09:54.895 --> 09:56.163
I'm not going anywhere.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.999
Sweetheart, do you
want us to arrest you

09:59.032 --> 10:02.169
and lead you out of here
in cuffs?

10:02.202 --> 10:04.705
I didn't think so.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.207
Sorry for interrupting.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.810
Stay in school.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.316
This is crazy.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.285
I would never kill anyone,
thank you very much.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.987
How'd you get
Caroline's ring?

10:20.020 --> 10:21.121
It was just sitting
on her dresser.

10:21.154 --> 10:21.855
Where were you
last night?

10:21.889 --> 10:23.891
A cappella rehearsal.
Go check.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.759
We will, sweetheart.
Don't worry about that.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.662
Okay, it's no secret.
I didn't like Caroline.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.764
But I had no reason
to kill her.

10:30.798 --> 10:31.999
She was writing
all your papers.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.033
The school
was investigating.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.735
Your ass was about
to be expelled.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.236
Hudson won't expel anyone.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.838
Higher grades
keep parents happy,

10:37.871 --> 10:39.372
and happy parents
are big donors.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.774
(Fin)
Like yours.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.276
Your family has a building
named after 'em.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.778
And a couple of wings.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.080
A hospital and a museum.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.015
You wouldn't wanna screw up
a bright future

10:48.048 --> 10:49.082
by getting kicked
out of school, would you?

10:49.116 --> 10:51.885
Caroline's got your number.
She talks, you're done.

10:51.919 --> 10:54.722
Do you honestly think
I could kill Caroline?

10:54.755 --> 10:55.823
Well, I'll tell you what.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.792
Why don't we ask your parents
and see what they think?

10:58.826 --> 11:00.828
Got a better idea.
We call the Ledger.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.797
"Culhane Heiress in
a Murder Investigation."

11:03.831 --> 11:05.332
Sell a lot of papers.
Look, wait.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.436
Don't call anyone.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.839
I'll check her alibi.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.844
What?

11:16.877 --> 11:20.280
Caroline bragged about
ripping off some rich,

11:20.313 --> 11:21.381
famous guy for the ring.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.783
She said he was
really pissed off.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.151
Maybe he killed her.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.120
Okay, so who's this guy
that she stole the ring from?

11:27.154 --> 11:28.922
All she said was he'd
wake up the next morning

11:28.956 --> 11:31.158
and miss it real bad.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.361
I told you my alibi
would check out.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.797
Singin' the Indigo Girls
in five-part harmony.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.398
That's painful.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.333
I got a feeling we're gonna
need to speak to you again.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.035
So don't hop on any
flights to France.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.938
Mmm, cop, comedian.
Is there anything you don't do?

11:44.972 --> 11:46.473
No. Elevator's
straight ahead.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.275
Had a hunch
about that ring.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.943
So I talked
to one of my boys

11:49.977 --> 11:51.311
who bounces
at a couple of clubs.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.946
It's a Double D.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.948
I thought rings came
in a different sizing system.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.784
Double D as in
Diamond Dov.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.118
Who's Diamond Dov?

11:58.151 --> 12:00.353
An Israeli dude.
He's a jeweler to the stars.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.056
Real popular with actors,
musicians, and pro athletes.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.058
If Caroline
was turning tricks,

12:05.092 --> 12:07.360
maybe she slipped the ring
off some drunken John's finger.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.362
Yeah, some rich
and famous John

12:09.396 --> 12:11.231
who'd miss it real bad
in the morning.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.066
He tries to set up
a meet to get the ring back.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.503
When she shows up empty-handed,
he loses control.

12:16.536 --> 12:17.905
How much is
that thing worth?

12:17.938 --> 12:20.040
100 grand, give or take.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.942
Blackmail's a strong motive.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.344
If it's a custom job,
Diamond Dov can tell us

12:24.377 --> 12:26.346
who he made it for.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.348
(Fin)
You must have some
big spenders come in here

12:28.381 --> 12:30.150
for pieces this nice.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.885
(Diamond Dov)
You bet your ass I do.

12:31.919 --> 12:34.287
I use only the finest jewels.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.555
I make art.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.891
And celebrities
around the world

12:37.925 --> 12:39.793
are my collectors.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.494
My work ends up
in movies,

12:41.528 --> 12:43.096
on TV,
in the videos

12:43.130 --> 12:44.932
for all the rapping
and the dance music.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.100
Thanks to all
my happy customers.

12:47.134 --> 12:50.237
Okay, which one of your
happy customers bought this?

12:50.270 --> 12:52.439
What, you take me
for a friar?

12:52.472 --> 12:54.174
I'm sorry, detectives,
but I don't give out

12:54.207 --> 12:57.310
personal information
on my customers.

12:57.344 --> 12:58.311
That's why they love me.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.847
I know who else'll love you.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.882
The IRS, once we get
a warrant for your files.

13:01.915 --> 13:02.983
Okay, okay.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.985
Let's relax.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.087
Hmm.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.322
I made this ring
for a football player.

13:09.356 --> 13:11.925
Franklin.
Roddy Franklin.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.493
There.
Are we cool?

13:13.526 --> 13:14.461
(Fin)
Cool.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.596
Roddy Franklin,
wide receiver for New Jersey.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.299
1,000 yards,
nine T.D.s last season.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.834
Let's go get his autograph.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.272
Look, I love the police,
but, uh,

13:25.305 --> 13:27.340
my business manager
handles all my donations.

13:27.374 --> 13:29.276
That's not
why we're here.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.844
Hey, guys...guys!

13:32.579 --> 13:34.247
All right, look.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.449
Why don't you go in the kitchen
with your mother, all right?

13:36.483 --> 13:38.185
[sighs]

13:38.218 --> 13:40.153
She acts all surprised when
she feeds them full of sugar

13:40.187 --> 13:41.889
and they run around
like they're insane.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.190
Now, what can
I do for you?

13:43.223 --> 13:44.925
That belong to you?
Yeah.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.060
Hey, where did you--
How did you find this?

13:47.094 --> 13:49.396
First, let's start
with where you lost it.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.631
Man, I don't even know, dawg.
I travel a lot.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.200
Okay, dawg...

13:53.233 --> 13:54.968
Travel anywhere
two nights ago?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.038
Yeah, my wife and I
took the kids

13:58.071 --> 13:59.139
over to
their grandmother's.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.941
Mind if I confirm that
with your wife?

14:00.974 --> 14:02.943
Not at all.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.077
What's this about?

14:04.111 --> 14:05.178
Know this girl?

14:05.212 --> 14:08.949
No, never seen her before.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.951
Two nights ago
we took the boys

14:10.984 --> 14:12.352
over to my mother's.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.987
You sure about that?

14:14.021 --> 14:15.022
Yes, I am.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.056
Why?

14:16.089 --> 14:17.324
We recovered
your husband's ring

14:17.357 --> 14:19.492
when we were investigating
a homicide.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.527
[chuckles]

14:20.560 --> 14:22.529
That thing.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.597
He told me it was stolen.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.599
I said,
"Of course it was."

14:26.633 --> 14:30.270
Stupid to buy a ring that
cost more than our first home.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.472
Your ring was found
in her dorm room.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.641
Oh, then she must have
been the one who found it.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.276
Look, thank you
for bringing it back to me.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.544
Uh, why don't you
give me her name,

14:37.577 --> 14:39.646
and I'll, uh,
I'll send her a reward.

14:39.679 --> 14:42.482
Make it out to Caroline Pereira
in care of The Afterlife.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.952
What? She's dead?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.687
Yeah, we found her body
two nights ago.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.122
Oh, man, I'm--

14:49.156 --> 14:51.158
I'm sorry you had
to find it like this.

14:51.191 --> 14:54.394
I'm sorry.
It's evidence in a homicide.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.629
You'll have to wait
until we find the killer.

14:59.532 --> 15:00.667
Guy loses a rock
worth 100 grand.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.335
Doesn't report it.
You buying that?

15:02.369 --> 15:04.071
His wife
backed his alibi,

15:04.104 --> 15:06.239
but I got a feeling
she's used to covering for him.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.141
Wonder if Franklin's
Caroline's sugar daddy.

15:08.175 --> 15:11.511
Caroline falls in love,
threatens to go to the wife.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.480
That's one big,
fancy mansion

15:13.513 --> 15:15.983
Caroline could have
brought tumbling down.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.552
(Cragen)
So what do we know
about Franklin?

15:19.586 --> 15:21.021
What kind of reputation
does he have?

15:21.054 --> 15:22.089
He keeps a low profile

15:22.122 --> 15:23.223
after that thing
with the stripper

15:23.256 --> 15:24.457
a few years back.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.625
What thing
with the stripper?

15:25.658 --> 15:26.626
His wife caught him.

15:26.659 --> 15:28.061
Had to buy her
a diamond necklace

15:28.095 --> 15:29.997
that cost more than
an aircraft carrier.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.232
Maybe this affair was gonna cost
him more than he could afford.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.267
(Fin)
Caroline's gotta disappear.

15:34.301 --> 15:36.136
I think they made a habit
of disappearing together.

15:36.169 --> 15:37.470
This is Caroline's
credit card statement.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.139
It's mostly stores
and restaurants

15:39.172 --> 15:40.273
around the university.

15:40.307 --> 15:42.109
But there are two charges
from a pharmacy

15:42.142 --> 15:43.710
in Atlantic City.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.512
The same weekend
Roddy Franklin filled up

15:45.545 --> 15:48.581
at a gas station
in Little Bay,

15:48.615 --> 15:50.350
which is right
outside A.C.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.085
That's good place
to take his mistress.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.421
Famous guy doesn't turn
as many heads down there.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.388
People are discreet.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.058
Well, if you have time
for blackjack,

15:58.091 --> 16:00.293
stick with
the $5.00 tables.

16:04.131 --> 16:05.298
(male hotel manager)
Yes, of course.

16:05.332 --> 16:07.534
Mr. Franklin's a frequent
guest of the casino.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.469
When was the last time
he was here?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.038
Celebrity poker tournament.

16:11.071 --> 16:12.039
When was that?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.374
Uh, the weekend of the...

16:14.407 --> 16:16.176
Seventh.
Two months ago.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.777
Same weekend as Caroline.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.513
You ever see him
with this girl?

16:20.547 --> 16:23.116
Sure. He finally
catch up with her?

16:23.150 --> 16:24.217
Maybe. She's dead.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.619
Any idea why?

16:26.653 --> 16:29.422
There's something
you should see.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.226
This is one of our
private games.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.262
Upstairs room.
High rollers only.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.363
(Fin)
There's Caroline and Franklin.

16:36.396 --> 16:40.367
Mr. Franklin came here
to play after the charity match.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.734
How'd Caroline
get in the game?

16:41.768 --> 16:43.470
She comes down
every other weekend.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.106
We comp her room and meals.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.140
There it is.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.408
After Caroline raises,

16:48.441 --> 16:50.777
Franklin bets his ring
to go all in.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.345
And not hard
to understand why.

16:52.379 --> 16:55.215
He had a straight to the Jack.
Great hand.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.183
But he got counterfeited.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.518
Caroline had
a King high straight.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.688
And that was it.
She wins.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.291
(Fin)
Look, she puts on the ring.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.229
(Stabler)
And then really
taunts him with it.

17:09.262 --> 17:13.233
(Fin)
Franklin doesn't
look too happy.

17:13.266 --> 17:15.435
You're right about that.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.375
(Franklin)
I run up.
This cat takes a one-step.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.276
Fires it.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.178
The rock hits me
in the back of the helmet

17:25.212 --> 17:27.147
like he's a new dodge ball
world champion.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.282
Hey, Roddy.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.386
What can I do for you?

17:33.420 --> 17:35.288
Come with us.
We'll explain in the car.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.095
It's all good, fellas.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.131
It's the cops that found
my Double D.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.832
That's not the only thing
we found.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.503
Your ass is gonna be
Astroturf

17:50.537 --> 17:52.105
you don't
start talking.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.106
About what?

17:53.140 --> 17:55.575
Caroline Pereira.

17:55.608 --> 17:59.112
We have you two on tape
playing poker in Atlantic City.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.547
[sighs]

18:00.580 --> 18:02.482
Now, why'd you
lie to us?

18:02.515 --> 18:04.817
'Cause I wasn't supposed
to be there, all right?

18:04.851 --> 18:07.120
Look, the leagues have
got me on probation

18:07.154 --> 18:09.489
for gambling.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.591
The only reason why they let me
play in celebrity tournaments

18:11.624 --> 18:13.760
is because the money
goes to charity.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.263
So what, Caroline
your favorite charity now?

18:16.296 --> 18:17.464
That's where you
donate your ring?

18:17.497 --> 18:19.666
I didn't donate it.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.369
She fleeced me
at the table.

18:22.402 --> 18:25.572
Look...the commissioner
finds out about this,

18:25.605 --> 18:28.141
I'm facing fines and multiple
game suspensions.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.510
Well, right now, you're
facing murder charges, buddy.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.911
What?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.380
No, yo, yo, look.

18:33.413 --> 18:34.681
Y'all got
the wrong one on this.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.449
So why should
we believe you?

18:38.318 --> 18:40.353
[sighs]

18:43.423 --> 18:45.392
'Cause I know who did it.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.399
Okay, Roddy,
who killed the girl?

18:54.767 --> 18:56.936
Guy who runs
an underground poker game.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.938
She win one of his
fancy rings too?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.740
No, no, no, man.
Look...

19:00.773 --> 19:02.875
It was like this,
all right?

19:02.909 --> 19:05.278
I tried to buy my ring back,
but she wouldn't let me.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.513
Said I had
to win it back.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.281
You had to keep
playing?

19:08.315 --> 19:09.682
What else could I do?

19:09.716 --> 19:12.652
Look, so I invited her
to a private game in the city.

19:12.685 --> 19:13.620
But this girl
was a ringer.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.654
She kept beating you.

19:14.687 --> 19:15.688
Me and everybody else
at the club.

19:15.722 --> 19:18.558
She became a regular,
so I figured sooner or later

19:18.591 --> 19:20.527
I'd get back
what was mine.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.262
But instead,
she got hers.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.464
A couple nights back,
Caroline hit a streak

19:24.497 --> 19:25.598
of bad luck.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.335
Fell into the house
north of 150 grand.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.270
Dude that runs the game
threatened her.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.939
Said she had 24 hours
to pay back the money, or else.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.807
This dude got a name?
Yeah.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.943
Riley. He's got
ice water in his veins.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.579
Like he'd kill you
and then send out for pizza.

19:39.612 --> 19:40.913
Where's the game?

19:40.947 --> 19:44.284
In the Garment District.
38th Street.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.286
Three blocks from where
we found Caroline's body.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.555
Police!
Stay where you are.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.822
(Riley)
What the hell's
going on here?

19:49.856 --> 19:50.923
You Riley?
I am.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.792
And for the hard of hearing,
I repeat:

19:52.825 --> 19:54.494
What the hell
is going on here?

19:54.527 --> 19:55.762
You're under arrest.
For what?

19:55.795 --> 19:57.797
For running
an illegal poker game.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.266
Hey, where you going,
sweetheart?

19:59.299 --> 20:00.132
Your shift ain't over.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.401
You're making
a big mistake.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.503
This is a friendly
social gathering.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.338
Friends don't steal
friends' life savings.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.373
Fin, come here.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.340
Put him in the car.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.741
All right. Let's go.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.743
[siren]

20:10.777 --> 20:11.911
What you got?

20:11.944 --> 20:14.314
Check on the wall.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.552
(Fin)
The red paint
under Caroline's nails.

20:19.586 --> 20:23.523
Riley killed her here.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.292
I don't know anything
about a dead chick.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.560
I sure don't know what
the hell I'm doing here.

20:27.594 --> 20:28.928
Get my lawyer.

20:28.961 --> 20:29.962
You're gonna need him, pal.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.431
We got a paint match
from that wall,

20:31.464 --> 20:32.965
and you got
a $150,000 motive.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.534
That's pretty much a lock.

20:34.567 --> 20:35.902
Why don't you shove
your lock up your ass?

20:35.935 --> 20:38.505
What'd you say to me?
Fin! Elliot.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.640
My office.

20:48.315 --> 20:49.015
[door shuts]

20:49.048 --> 20:50.650
This is Tom Cole.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.319
Secret Service.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.421
He's got some
fascinating news.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.622
Riley's with us.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.024
An informant?
Agent.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.492
Name's Doug Kirsten.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.361
He's a long-term undercover
working up a case.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.194
What's the target?

21:02.228 --> 21:03.596
Underground
gambling clubs

21:03.630 --> 21:04.897
and their links
to organized crime,

21:04.931 --> 21:06.433
domestic and foreign.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.600
All the gin joints
in this city,

21:07.634 --> 21:09.569
we had to walk into yours.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.304
Agent Kirsten
is not your killer.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.640
He'll brief you,
but I've got to preserve

21:13.673 --> 21:15.908
the integrity of our
investigation.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.711
Get him out of the cage,
without blowing his cover.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.313
You'll be lucky if my client
doesn't press charges.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.381
My lawyer'll be seein'

21:21.414 --> 21:22.515
the police commissioner
tomorrow.

21:22.549 --> 21:23.950
Why don't you go solve
a real crime

21:23.983 --> 21:25.485
instead of bothering
an honest businessman?

21:25.518 --> 21:26.686
Take it easy there,
tough guy.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.854
Don't even talk to me,
ass wipe.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.622
You picked the wrong guy
to mess with.

21:29.656 --> 21:30.823
Running a casino's illegal.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.859
Who's running a casino?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.394
I was entertaining friends.

21:36.629 --> 21:40.467
Atrium, 56th and 5th,
9:00 AM tomorrow.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.806
(Stabler)
If the girl was dead,
why didn't you just call it in?

21:46.839 --> 21:48.375
Not if it meant blowing
a 15-month sting.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.876
One of my bouncers
was there.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.644
Couldn't break cover
in front of him.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.713
I couldn't have a body
turning up next to the game.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.582
The investigation
had to come first.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.049
So you had to leave her
under a grate?

21:57.083 --> 21:59.852
I was trying
to preserve the evidence.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.954
I don't feel good
about what I did.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.590
But I had to do it.

22:03.623 --> 22:04.691
It's part of the job.

22:04.724 --> 22:06.125
What happened
that night?

22:06.158 --> 22:08.661
Right after Caroline
left the club,

22:08.695 --> 22:10.630
heard a lot of yelling
from the alley.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.099
Players got nervous,
thought we were being raided.

22:13.132 --> 22:14.867
So I went out
with one of the bouncers.

22:14.901 --> 22:16.969
She was dead,
and her killer was gone.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.838
We know she hit the tables
hard in A.C.

22:18.871 --> 22:20.106
She play anywhere else?

22:20.139 --> 22:22.509
Online.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.010
Chat up the players
to learn about

22:24.043 --> 22:26.746
other underground games
in the city.

22:26.779 --> 22:30.116
Last week, Caroline tells me
she'd just been booted

22:30.149 --> 22:33.953
from her favorite online site,
pokerfastlane.com.

22:33.986 --> 22:36.489
You only get kicked off
those sites for cheating.

22:36.523 --> 22:37.390
How do you cheat online?

22:37.424 --> 22:39.526
Same way you do
in real life.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.993
Two people sit at
two separate computers,

22:41.027 --> 22:43.763
play in the same online room
at the same time.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.599
Share information.
And dump hands.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.637
Sounds like Caroline might have
had a silent partner.

22:50.670 --> 22:51.638
Maybe he was
bankrolling her.

22:51.671 --> 22:53.440
The 150 grand she owed you

22:53.473 --> 22:54.841
was gonna come out
of her partner's pocket.

22:54.874 --> 22:58.778
Caroline dead, and her
partner's identity a secret,

22:58.811 --> 23:01.013
that debt goes away.

23:01.047 --> 23:04.817
It's a hell of a motive
for murder.

23:04.851 --> 23:08.421
This is Caroline's
account information
from pokerfastlane.com.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.122
It's a record of her
logon/logoff times

23:10.156 --> 23:12.625
in the three months preceding
her account termination.

23:12.659 --> 23:13.460
So what does it give us?

23:13.493 --> 23:15.462
Every time Caroline
visited the site,

23:15.495 --> 23:18.865
so did a player with
a user ID Jack King.

23:18.898 --> 23:19.866
Jack King?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.534
Well, that's gotta
be a code name.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.835
Can you track him down?

23:22.869 --> 23:23.836
He uses an untraceable
e-mail address

23:23.870 --> 23:26.606
to make wire transfers
into his gambling account.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.808
Dude's got an electronic
poker face.

23:28.841 --> 23:29.842
Yeah, but if he's
a heavy gambler,

23:29.876 --> 23:31.478
he's gotta belly up
to that table.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.212
Hungry for a score.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.081
Let's smoke him out.

23:35.114 --> 23:37.584
Send him an e-mail.
Invite him to play poker.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.686
Invitation's gotta come
from somebody he knows.

23:39.719 --> 23:40.987
Otherwise,
why would he answer?

23:41.020 --> 23:43.122
He knows who ran
Caroline's game.

23:43.155 --> 23:45.124
Let's have Riley e-mail him.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.626
[chips stacking]

23:46.659 --> 23:47.727
Raise.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.596
I'll see that,
and I'll raise you five.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.464
[knock on door]
Call.

23:51.498 --> 23:53.065
I'm in.
Yeah?

23:53.099 --> 23:55.001
(man)
Jack King.

23:56.969 --> 23:58.137
Here for the game.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.972
Welcome.

24:00.006 --> 24:02.074
Ah, I'll fold.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.243
Hi, Jack.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.146
Adam?

24:07.179 --> 24:09.516
Sorry, buddy.
You're not goin' anywhere.

24:09.549 --> 24:12.018
I can't believe
I fell for this.

24:12.051 --> 24:14.153
You're not the only one
who knows how to bluff.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.490
Adam Halder,
you're under arrest

24:17.524 --> 24:20.459
for the murder
of Caroline Pereira.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.729
Hey, I got it.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.964
Thanks.
Anything good?

24:24.997 --> 24:25.898
Not really.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.166
Adam doesn't
come from much.

24:27.199 --> 24:28.801
The dad works
in a warehouse,

24:28.835 --> 24:29.936
the mom at a doughnut shop.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.203
Adam doesn't even
have a sheet.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.705
That's what I thought.

24:32.739 --> 24:34.741
Then why'd you get me
in here to check?

24:34.774 --> 24:36.208
Just wanna know
who this kid is.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.877
Usually we let
the defense attorney

24:37.910 --> 24:38.745
dig up the sob story.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.146
No...

24:40.179 --> 24:42.214
Look, the more I know,
the easier I can break him.

24:42.248 --> 24:43.149
He's a murderer.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.752
He killed Caroline Pereira
to erase his debt.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.954
There's more to him
than that.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.889
So what?

25:01.067 --> 25:02.301
Told you
I'm not thirsty.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.603
Drink it.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.004
You'll feel better.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.173
I'm never gonna
feel better.

25:09.776 --> 25:12.579
You know, Adam, I've been
doing this for a long time.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.014
And I can tell when
a good kid...

25:15.047 --> 25:17.216
gets pulled into
a bad thing.

25:20.787 --> 25:23.155
Just talk with me,
that's all.

25:27.193 --> 25:30.897
Caroline was my best friend
since we were kids.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.966
All we wanted to do was
get the hell out of LaGrange.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.737
First step, same college?

25:37.770 --> 25:41.674
But...Hudson
wasn't any better.

25:43.643 --> 25:46.646
We were still just
poor kids from the boondocks.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.280
Washing dishes
and serving up meals.

25:48.314 --> 25:51.083
Well...

25:51.117 --> 25:52.785
Must have been tough.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.590
Caroline couldn't take it.

25:57.624 --> 26:00.159
She started selling
term papers.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.761
Mm-hmm.

26:01.794 --> 26:04.330
That's when I started the--
the poker partnership.

26:04.363 --> 26:10.102
All right, now...
So how'd that work?

26:10.136 --> 26:12.939
We'd work
different clubs.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.807
And then every month,
we'd switch

26:14.841 --> 26:16.909
after trading information
about the regulars.

26:16.943 --> 26:19.011
The money rolled in.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.748
Caroline paid her tuition
off her winnings.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.918
What'd you do with yours?

26:25.952 --> 26:28.087
The good life.

26:28.120 --> 26:32.659
Clubs and restaurants
and...concerts.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.160
Hangin' with
the rich kids.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.729
Well, you weren't
working for them anymore.

26:39.131 --> 26:42.068
I wasn't invisible anymore.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.104
I wasn't on the other side.

26:45.137 --> 26:48.207
I had a whole new life.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.914
Then Caroline
screwed it up.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.883
I mean...

26:59.218 --> 27:03.322
I told her...
to take things slow.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.760
Not to be so greedy.

27:07.794 --> 27:09.996
But she wouldn't
listen to you.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.233
I was gonna
lose everything.

27:18.905 --> 27:21.340
The call she got that night.
That was you?

27:23.810 --> 27:24.811
Yes.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.245
She told you
all the money was gone.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.714
Not just gone.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.717
She dug us into a hole
so deep,

27:30.750 --> 27:32.418
I knew we could
never get out.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.824
You had to stop her
from destroying your future.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.960
From going back
to that cafeteria

27:40.993 --> 27:45.031
and dishing out that food
to all your new friends.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.966
Back to being invisible.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.004
Yes.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.773
No one knew about
your partnership.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.810
No one knew about
your half of the debt.

27:59.946 --> 28:03.449
So you strangled
your best friend.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.685
It was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.959
You need a lawyer.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.735
Casey.
I'm late.

28:22.769 --> 28:24.170
No, it'll just
take a second.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.772
I want to talk to you
about Adam Halder.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.740
What about him?

28:27.774 --> 28:29.408
Would you consider
pleading him out?

28:29.441 --> 28:31.811
He confessed to murder.

28:31.844 --> 28:32.945
No one's denying that.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.313
I just think
he deserves leniency.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.415
What have they done with
the real Detective Stabler?

28:36.448 --> 28:37.483
Hey, come on, look.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.151
I know this kid.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.187
You know him.
How so?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.322
Look, we come
from the same place.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.391
The guy works his ass off
to get into Hudson,

28:45.424 --> 28:47.760
and these rich kids
treat him like crap.

28:47.794 --> 28:49.128
You know how that feels.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.163
Yeah! I waited tables
in law school

28:51.197 --> 28:52.765
and served my classmates.

28:52.799 --> 28:55.534
It sucked, but it didn't
make me kill anyone.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.403
Would you at least
make sure

28:57.436 --> 28:59.338
he gets a good
legal aid attorney?

28:59.371 --> 29:02.108
Yeah, I'll make a call.

29:13.152 --> 29:14.987
Hey there, Casey.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.856
Walter.
What are you doing here?

29:16.889 --> 29:18.991
Can Adam Halder afford you?

29:19.025 --> 29:20.259
It's nice
to see you too.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.228
I'm taking this pro bono.
Adam called me.

29:22.261 --> 29:23.963
We know each other
from the poker clubs.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.198
(bailiff)
Come to order.
Court is now in session.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.100
Judge Lena Petrovsky
presiding.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.202
First case,
docket ending 262.

29:30.236 --> 29:31.804
People vs. Adam Halder.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.339
Murder in
the Second Degree.

29:33.372 --> 29:35.241
How does
the defendant plead?

29:35.274 --> 29:36.375
Not guilty.

29:36.408 --> 29:39.211
By reason of
mental disease or defect.

29:39.245 --> 29:40.379
What defect?

29:40.412 --> 29:42.982
Gambling addiction.

29:45.151 --> 29:46.385
Nifty defense,
don't you think?

29:46.418 --> 29:48.387
Are you kidding me?
It's B.S., and you know it.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.421
It's a real problem.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.824
2% of adults in this country
are gambling addicts.

29:51.858 --> 29:53.125
But that doesn't
make them kill.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.493
I don't buy it as
a justification for murder.

29:54.526 --> 29:55.327
And neither will a jury.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.864
12 people in that box,
you can be sure

29:57.897 --> 29:59.398
gambling addiction
touches one of their lives.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.400
If we go to trial
and they hear my witnesses,

30:01.433 --> 30:03.469
you will lose this case.

30:03.502 --> 30:04.971
Plead him down, Casey.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.273
Don't bet on it.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.379
(Camp)
Is Adam Halder a member
of the Campus Card Club?

30:13.412 --> 30:14.413
(Jordan)
Not anymore.

30:14.446 --> 30:15.614
(Camp)
Why not?

30:15.647 --> 30:17.183
He said he moved on
to bigger things.

30:17.216 --> 30:19.285
That our pots
were too small for him.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.152
How small?

30:20.186 --> 30:22.121
Oh, 50 bucks
here and there.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.622
We know where
to draw the line.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.957
Did Adam?

30:24.991 --> 30:26.926
No way.
He was out of control.

30:26.959 --> 30:28.360
I think he was hooked.

30:28.394 --> 30:29.595
Did a college hook him?

30:29.628 --> 30:31.130
Objection.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.464
Withdrawn.
Nothing further.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.566
You just said that Adam
was out of control.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.601
In what way?

30:35.634 --> 30:37.236
He's raise and raise

30:37.269 --> 30:39.872
and try to borrow from the house
to raise more.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.008
He was trying to take people
for money they didn't have.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.409
It was crazy.

30:43.442 --> 30:46.078
You gamble. Have you ever
gotten carried away like Adam?

30:46.112 --> 30:46.879
No.

30:46.913 --> 30:49.481
Have you ever lost big
at the tables?

30:49.515 --> 30:51.083
Sure, everyone has.

30:51.117 --> 30:52.551
You ever kill someone
to get out of paying off a debt?

30:52.584 --> 30:54.253
Objection, the witness
is not on trial.

30:54.286 --> 30:56.255
Sustained.

30:56.288 --> 30:59.625
Nothing further.

30:59.658 --> 31:02.094
Who funds
the Campus Card Club?

31:02.128 --> 31:03.229
Hudson University.

31:03.262 --> 31:06.065
We are an official
student organization.

31:06.098 --> 31:08.134
How much money do they
give you each semester?

31:08.167 --> 31:09.235
About $2,000.

31:09.268 --> 31:11.403
That covers our felts,
chips, cards,

31:11.437 --> 31:13.139
plus Xeroxing flyers.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.640
So you could say
Hudson University

31:14.673 --> 31:15.607
hooked Adam on poker.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.910
Objection.
I'll rephrase.

31:17.944 --> 31:19.311
You stated to Ms. Novak

31:19.345 --> 31:21.247
that Adam would
raise recklessly,

31:21.280 --> 31:23.049
and that in your opinion,

31:23.082 --> 31:24.483
quote, "It was crazy."

31:24.516 --> 31:25.985
Did you mean Adam was crazy?

31:26.018 --> 31:27.086
Yes.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.020
Why?

31:28.054 --> 31:30.222
One time he lost
a bunch of hands in a row...

31:30.256 --> 31:31.924
just went off.

31:31.958 --> 31:35.127
He flipped over three tables.
We had to call security.

31:35.161 --> 31:37.229
No further questions.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.502
I'm not the kind of guy
who says I told you so.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.237
Well, that's good, 'cause
I don't like those kinda guys.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.538
But you should have
taken the plea.

31:46.572 --> 31:47.639
I'd rather
sleep at night.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.075
I am not buying
what you're selling.

31:49.108 --> 31:50.109
This is real, Casey.

31:50.142 --> 31:53.079
Okay, drunk drivers kill
when under the influence.

31:53.112 --> 31:56.582
Adam wasn't gambling when he
took Caroline Pereira's life.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.952
He was not high.
He was in full control.

31:59.986 --> 32:02.354
You have no idea what gambling
addiction is like, do you?

32:04.991 --> 32:07.593
Last year, I lost
$30,000 in one night

32:07.626 --> 32:09.996
playing poker online.

32:10.029 --> 32:11.563
And the next night,
I chased my losses,

32:11.597 --> 32:13.599
and I lost another 40 grand.

32:13.632 --> 32:16.235
My wife jammed my laptop
down the garbage chute

32:16.268 --> 32:17.436
and made me
go to counseling.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.638
I kept on playing.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.673
You know what made me stop?

32:21.707 --> 32:24.510
Loan sharks broke my leg.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.078
But you didn't
kill your wife

32:26.112 --> 32:28.514
to pay the loan sharks off
with her insurance money.

32:28.547 --> 32:30.282
Did you?

32:33.252 --> 32:35.654
You never lost your mind.

32:37.656 --> 32:38.757
(Stabler)
Gambling addiction?

32:38.790 --> 32:40.159
Camp's a snake oil
salesman.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.994
Well, the jury might
be buying it.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.229
Well, maybe they should.

32:43.262 --> 32:44.563
People addicted to gambling
go broke,

32:44.596 --> 32:45.664
and they take
their whole families

32:45.697 --> 32:46.865
down the drain with them.

32:46.898 --> 32:49.135
Gambling addiction is as hard
to kick as drugs and alcohol.

32:49.168 --> 32:51.337
Yeah, but drugs and alcohol
affect the brain.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.304
So does gambling.

32:52.338 --> 32:55.374
Dopamine levels peak
when we anticipate a win.

32:55.407 --> 32:56.775
Gambling addicts
are chasing a high,

32:56.808 --> 32:58.110
just like drunks
and dopers.

32:58.144 --> 32:59.545
You think Adam's
an addict.

32:59.578 --> 33:01.680
His behavior fits
that diagnosis.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.550
And I'm telling you this has got
nothing to do with gambling.

33:04.583 --> 33:08.154
What's going on
with you and this kid?

33:12.424 --> 33:14.226
You know,
when I was Adam's age,

33:14.260 --> 33:16.395
I worked at
my uncle's bar.

33:16.428 --> 33:18.764
One night, I'm out back
emptying the trash

33:18.797 --> 33:21.467
when these two rich punks
jumped me.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.302
Now, I know
who they were

33:23.335 --> 33:25.171
because they'd spit in my face
earlier in the night

33:25.204 --> 33:27.139
when I wouldn't
serve 'em drinks.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.575
They had no I.D.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.643
So we're rolling around,
we're throwing punches,

33:31.677 --> 33:33.179
and I pick up a bottle

33:33.212 --> 33:35.547
and I bust one of them
over the head with it.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.816
Kid nearly died.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.552
Cops come, I give 'em
my story, they send me home.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.754
Next day, two detectives
come to my doorstep

33:42.788 --> 33:44.323
and they arrest me.

33:44.356 --> 33:45.557
For defending yourself.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.159
Well, the kid's father
was a partner

33:47.193 --> 33:48.427
in some
white-shoe law firm.

33:48.460 --> 33:49.528
He had a friend
in the DA's office.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.463
But my dad
called in a favor

33:51.497 --> 33:52.764
from an old
police academy buddy,

33:52.798 --> 33:54.500
so he made the whole thing
go away.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.634
This wasn't just
about self-defense.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.769
You were pissed.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.538
Look, this kid
spit in my face.

34:01.540 --> 34:05.711
He treats me like I'm
a working class piece of trash?

34:05.744 --> 34:07.379
No.

34:07.413 --> 34:10.316
Like Adam.

34:12.551 --> 34:13.652
Look, I'm just saying

34:13.685 --> 34:17.256
I get why he was
angry enough to do it.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.225
That doesn't justify
killing Caroline.

34:19.258 --> 34:20.326
If I want to convict Adam,

34:20.359 --> 34:22.194
I need the jury
to focus on his guilt.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.795
Then bring it back
to his anger.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.531
Show them that when Adam
strangled Caroline,

34:25.564 --> 34:27.199
it wasn't about addiction,
it was about rage.

34:36.142 --> 34:38.377
From a blocked
telephone number,

34:38.410 --> 34:39.778
you called Caroline
that night.

34:41.547 --> 34:42.248
Yes.

34:42.281 --> 34:43.582
Why?

34:43.615 --> 34:44.683
To check in on her.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.352
Well, that was
very thoughtful of you.

34:46.385 --> 34:47.753
What do you
remember her saying?

34:47.786 --> 34:49.288
That she needed
to see me.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.623
How'd that
make you feel?

34:51.657 --> 34:52.724
A little nervous.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.160
Nervous?

34:54.193 --> 34:55.294
So you remember
feeling nervous.

34:55.327 --> 34:58.330
But up until that point,
your head was clear and focused.

34:58.364 --> 35:00.366
At that point, yes.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.234
What did she say
when you got there?

35:02.268 --> 35:04.403
She'd lost $150,000.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.471
You remember that?

35:05.504 --> 35:06.472
Yes.

35:06.505 --> 35:09.308
What else did she say?

35:09.341 --> 35:10.509
She said she
was gonna tell Riley

35:10.542 --> 35:12.278
I was on the hook
for half the debt.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.380
It sounds like you remember
that night perfectly well.

35:14.413 --> 35:16.182
What happened next?

35:19.818 --> 35:22.788
We started arguing.

35:22.821 --> 35:24.723
And all of a sudden,
she pushed me.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.792
And you pushed her back.

35:26.825 --> 35:29.328
Yeah, against the wall.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.930
So you have a specific memory
of pushing her against the wall.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.232
Then what?

35:34.566 --> 35:35.701
She fell.

35:37.236 --> 35:40.339
She tried to stand, but I kept
pushing her back down.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.180
And then?

35:48.214 --> 35:51.817
She started screaming,
so I had to shut her up.

35:51.850 --> 35:55.554
(Novak)
How did you do that?

35:55.587 --> 35:58.324
I put my hands
around her neck.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.794
What was going
through your mind?

36:02.828 --> 36:04.830
Nothing.
My head was spinning.

36:07.633 --> 36:10.769
I kept squeezing her neck
tighter and tighter.

36:12.604 --> 36:16.742
Then there was a bright flash,
and everything went white.

36:16.775 --> 36:18.410
I must have strangled her.

36:18.444 --> 36:19.978
(Novak)
Must have?

36:20.011 --> 36:20.946
You don't remember?

36:20.979 --> 36:22.348
'Cause up until
a moment ago,

36:22.381 --> 36:23.181
you had a clear head

36:23.215 --> 36:25.284
and a steel trap memory
for the night.

36:25.317 --> 36:26.718
(Adam)
Yeah, but everything changed.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.687
(Novak)
Everything changed
because Caroline was dead.

36:28.720 --> 36:29.955
No, it was all a haze.

36:29.988 --> 36:30.889
(Novak)
You just finished
telling the court

36:30.922 --> 36:32.958
how clear and focused
you were.

36:32.991 --> 36:35.594
(Adam)
No, that was before.
Please, it was an accident!

36:35.627 --> 36:37.529
An accidental strangling?

36:37.563 --> 36:39.998
(Adam)
I swear, I didn't
wanna kill her.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.867
I'm sorry.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.336
I didn't mean to.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.337
I'm sorry.

36:45.371 --> 36:47.839
People's Two, Your Honor.

36:50.842 --> 36:54.613
Was Caroline wearing
this ring when you killed her?

36:54.646 --> 36:55.914
Objection.

36:55.947 --> 36:57.416
Relevance?

36:57.449 --> 36:59.685
(Petrovsky)
I'll allow it.

37:01.353 --> 37:03.589
Yes, she was wearing it.

37:03.622 --> 37:06.558
What's your relationship
to Caroline's roommate,

37:06.592 --> 37:07.659
Gloria Culhane?

37:11.463 --> 37:14.566
I can repeat the question
if you didn't understand me.

37:17.703 --> 37:20.306
Gloria's my girlfriend.

37:20.339 --> 37:23.442
(Novak)
Nothing further.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.416
I'd like to request
a recess, Your Honor.

37:30.449 --> 37:31.883
(Petrovsky)
We'll resume tomorrow morning.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.552
[gavel strikes]

37:36.888 --> 37:38.657
How did you know?

37:41.327 --> 37:43.829
Well, I'll be damned.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.965
Check out the glare
in the corner.

37:46.998 --> 37:49.701
It's from the flash
reflecting off Caroline's ring.

37:49.735 --> 37:51.837
The same thing happened
when Caroline photographed Adam

37:51.870 --> 37:53.705
attacking her
in the alley.

37:53.739 --> 37:54.840
That's weird.
Why would she do that?

37:54.873 --> 37:56.475
Well, a lot of things
can make sense

37:56.508 --> 37:57.576
as a last ditch effort

37:57.609 --> 38:00.078
to stop someone
from taking your life.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.547
This ring was on
Caroline's finger

38:01.580 --> 38:03.415
when she took the photo.

38:03.449 --> 38:04.850
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.585
Sure you do.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.019
Hmm?

38:08.053 --> 38:09.321
Adam's your boyfriend.

38:09.355 --> 38:10.989
[scoffs]
I wouldn't call him that.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.558
He did.
He lied.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.393
You're the liar.

38:14.426 --> 38:17.663
You didn't find Caroline's
ring on her dresser.

38:17.696 --> 38:20.332
All right,
Adam gave me the ring.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.602
So you knew he killed her.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.504
I did?

38:25.537 --> 38:28.640
Wipe that smirk
off your face.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.576
You're an accessory
to murder, princess.

38:30.609 --> 38:33.612
You've got
nothing on me.

38:33.645 --> 38:36.014
How did a poor kid like Adam
get a girl like you?

38:36.047 --> 38:36.915
He earned it.

38:36.948 --> 38:40.486
He bought me nice things.
He took me out.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.554
He treated me
the way I deserve.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.623
I live
a certain lifestyle.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.125
If Adam wanted me,
he had to give me what I need.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.428
By whatever means
necessary, right?

38:49.461 --> 38:50.662
[sighs]
Whatever.

38:50.696 --> 38:51.763
When Caroline
got him in debt,

38:51.797 --> 38:54.566
Adam wouldn't have had
any more money to spend on you.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.035
Did you tell him that
you'd stay with him,

38:57.068 --> 38:59.371
even though he had to
go back to washing dishes?

38:59.405 --> 39:01.039
Or did you tell him
to kill Caroline?

39:01.072 --> 39:02.874
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.676
Adam isn't
addicted to gambling.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.912
He's addicted to you.

39:06.945 --> 39:09.114
Is that so hard
to imagine?

39:09.147 --> 39:10.949
Look, Adam made
his own mistakes.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.484
He faced
losing everything.

39:12.518 --> 39:14.953
He faced losing me.
He was enraged.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.723
How enraged?

39:17.756 --> 39:19.725
He was out of his mind.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.560
I'd never seen him
like that before.

39:21.593 --> 39:24.596
What happened when Adam
contacted you that night?

39:24.630 --> 39:25.897
I was at
a cappella rehearsal.

39:25.931 --> 39:28.400
He sent me a text message
to meet him outside.

39:28.434 --> 39:29.568
I did.

39:29.601 --> 39:31.570
[chuckles]
He was...in a state.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.439
Gloria, please, stop!

39:33.472 --> 39:35.507
Mr. Halder,
control yourself.

39:35.541 --> 39:38.076
Did Adam say he was going
downtown to harm Caroline?

39:44.650 --> 39:46.585
He...said
he might have to.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.053
I love you!
Don't do this!

39:48.086 --> 39:49.488
One more outburst,

39:49.521 --> 39:51.590
and I will
remove the defendant.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.024
Adam, please.

39:55.093 --> 39:57.729
Did Adam
say anything else?

39:57.763 --> 40:01.467
He said if she
wouldn't keep her mouth shut,

40:01.500 --> 40:03.869
that he would
shut it for her.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.071
It sounds to me like
his mind was made up.

40:17.983 --> 40:19.885
No more questions.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.195
(Petrovsky)
On the charge of
Murder in the Second Degree,

40:30.228 --> 40:31.730
how do you find?

40:31.763 --> 40:33.732
We find
the defendant guilty.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.901
(Petrovsky)
Thank you for your service.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.603
[gavel strikes]
This court is adjourned.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.682
How could you
do this to me?

40:50.716 --> 40:53.519
You did this to yourself.

40:58.890 --> 40:59.991
That was cold.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.259
So?

41:01.292 --> 41:02.994
You had a hand in this.

41:03.028 --> 41:04.796
My hands are clean.
No, they're not.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.998
That ring Adam gave you
was stolen property.

41:07.032 --> 41:10.035
It's a Class C felony.
You're looking at 15 years.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.137
What are you talking about?
Caroline was dead.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.139
That doesn't make
the ring yours.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.941
Adam stole it.
You knowingly possessed it.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.042
This is insane!

41:17.075 --> 41:19.110
They don't allow
diamond rings in prison.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.513
Think you're gonna have
to settle for silver bracelets.

41:57.616 --> 42:00.018
[wolf howling]
