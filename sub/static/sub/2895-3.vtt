00:00.909 --> 00:02.781
Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

00:02.782 --> 00:04.943
You're good with me working
on the takeover with Logan.

00:05.001 --> 00:08.253
As long as we don't let that
affect this.

00:08.338 --> 00:09.922
We won't.

00:10.006 --> 00:11.506
I do always get what I want,

00:11.574 --> 00:14.209
and what I want to do with
this company is strip it down,

00:14.260 --> 00:15.427
flip it over, and then--

00:15.511 --> 00:16.912
That's enough.
We're done.

00:16.963 --> 00:18.213
You're right.

00:18.264 --> 00:19.431
We are.

00:19.515 --> 00:21.216
When I told you that
our relationship was now

00:21.267 --> 00:22.918
purely professional,
I was serious.

00:22.969 --> 00:24.970
What's not purely professional
about lunch?

00:25.054 --> 00:27.255
Unless you mean the sex
that'll be following lunch.

00:27.307 --> 00:30.025
Phillip, your son,
you lost him,

00:30.092 --> 00:32.978
and that's what this company
is to you now, your family.

00:33.062 --> 00:35.530
I lost both my parents
when I was 11 years old,

00:35.598 --> 00:38.150
so I know a little something
about needing family.

00:38.234 --> 00:40.035
Since when does the S.E.C.
go around

00:40.102 --> 00:42.821
intimidating law firms
by going after their clients?

00:42.906 --> 00:44.773
They don't,
but they will when Eric Woodall

00:44.824 --> 00:47.843
starts there next week.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

00:56.502 --> 00:57.886
Another all-nighter?

00:57.954 --> 00:59.671
Yeah.

00:59.756 --> 01:00.889
Work or school?

01:00.957 --> 01:01.957
Work.

01:01.958 --> 01:04.309
What were you working on?

01:04.394 --> 01:06.261
You know what I was
working on.

01:06.312 --> 01:08.129
I am so sorry,
but I'm so tired.

01:08.181 --> 01:10.298
I have to go get some sleep
before I go back to the office.

01:10.350 --> 01:11.350
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:11.351 --> 01:12.734
I haven't seen you in two days.

01:12.802 --> 01:14.302
Give me five minutes.

01:14.354 --> 01:17.439
Okay,
but I can't be responsible

01:17.490 --> 01:19.191
for anything that I say.

01:19.275 --> 01:21.142
Well, okay, in that case,

01:21.194 --> 01:23.144
is Logan going
after another board member?

01:23.196 --> 01:24.196
Nice try.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.497
Mm,
is he running out of cash?

01:25.581 --> 01:27.148
I can't tell you that.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.535
Did you love him?

01:30.620 --> 01:33.588
How long have you been waiting
to ask me that?

01:33.656 --> 01:35.707
You know, just when you were
at your weakest

01:35.792 --> 01:39.661
and most vulnerable.

01:39.712 --> 01:43.515
I did love him,
but I don't love him now.

01:43.599 --> 01:46.051
I love you.

01:47.303 --> 01:48.971
Who ended it?

01:49.022 --> 01:51.773
- Does that matter?
- It does to me.

01:54.527 --> 01:56.311
I ended it.

01:56.362 --> 01:58.122
Now, do you have
any other burning questions,

01:58.180 --> 02:00.866
or can I go to sleep,
please?

02:00.950 --> 02:02.617
Um, let me see.

02:02.685 --> 02:05.070
What's the most expensive thing
you ever shoplifted?

02:05.154 --> 02:06.788
Were you a mean girl?

02:06.856 --> 02:08.907
Are you interested in taking
a pole dancing class?

02:08.991 --> 02:11.359
You know what?
We'll get into that later.

02:11.411 --> 02:14.162
Sweet dreams.

02:14.213 --> 02:15.213
God, enough about you.

02:15.214 --> 02:16.832
I want to talk about me.

02:16.883 --> 02:18.300
We were just talking
about you.

02:18.367 --> 02:20.836
Not enough.

02:20.887 --> 02:22.721
All right, fine.
Let's talk about Harvey.

02:22.805 --> 02:24.706
- Mm.
- So guess what he's been up to.

02:24.757 --> 02:26.207
What?

02:26.259 --> 02:30.045
He found the master tapes
for his father's solo album.

02:30.096 --> 02:32.431
He's working on buying them.

02:32.515 --> 02:35.517
He's been trying to find them
ever since he lost his father.

02:35.568 --> 02:39.104
Oh, I see why
you're telling me this.

02:39.188 --> 02:40.655
You're trying
to humanize Harvey,

02:40.723 --> 02:43.992
because you're afraid of what
this fight is gonna do to us.

02:44.060 --> 02:46.361
I'm afraid because of what
it's already doing to you.

02:46.412 --> 02:47.996
I'm talking Ali-Frazier.

02:48.064 --> 02:49.064
Come on, Donna.

02:49.115 --> 02:50.999
Listen to me.

02:51.067 --> 02:52.400
They started out like brothers.

02:52.452 --> 02:54.202
Then they went toe-to-toe
three times,

02:54.253 --> 02:57.456
and Joe Frazier went to
his grave hating Muhammad Ali.

02:57.540 --> 02:59.875
I didn't know
you were a boxing fan.

02:59.926 --> 03:01.877
I'm a Harvey fan.

03:01.928 --> 03:05.847
So am I, and that's why
I'm giving him my best.

03:08.217 --> 03:11.269
Thanks for the coffee.
You're welcome.

03:16.776 --> 03:17.926
You're in late.

03:17.977 --> 03:19.277
I was up late.

03:19.362 --> 03:21.229
Working on my stuff?

03:21.280 --> 03:23.932
Working on a lot of stuff.

03:23.983 --> 03:24.983
What can I help you with?

03:24.984 --> 03:26.985
I wanted to talk to you.

03:27.070 --> 03:28.987
About?

03:29.072 --> 03:32.124
Well, when I told you before
that I'm not the same guy

03:32.208 --> 03:34.459
that I used to be,
what I meant was,

03:34.544 --> 03:37.579
I got caught up in emotion
back then.

03:37.630 --> 03:39.714
I'm not caught up
in emotion anymore.

03:39.782 --> 03:40.949
And?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.635
And that means
that I'm gonna have to do

03:43.719 --> 03:45.453
some calculated things,

03:45.505 --> 03:47.288
and I needed to know
that you're okay with that.

03:47.340 --> 03:50.125
Why wouldn't I be?

03:50.176 --> 03:51.626
You know why.

03:51.677 --> 03:53.157
Logan,
you don't have to come and have

03:53.229 --> 03:54.629
these little check-in talks
with me.

03:54.680 --> 03:57.182
I am a big girl, and I know how
these things work.

03:57.266 --> 04:01.820
So just do what you have to do,
and stop worrying about me.

04:01.904 --> 04:05.273
Great.

04:09.695 --> 04:11.580
Harvey,
what the hell's going on?

04:11.647 --> 04:13.698
At the moment,
I'm 18 minutes away

04:13.783 --> 04:16.651
from owning Steve McQueen's
Shelby Cobra.

04:16.702 --> 04:17.986
You know what
I'm talking about.

04:18.036 --> 04:19.754
Last time I saw you,
you told me you were gonna

04:19.822 --> 04:21.123
get me this company.

04:21.173 --> 04:23.491
I just found out Walter Gillis
funded his pension.

04:23.543 --> 04:25.260
Did you think
they wouldn't fight back?

04:25.327 --> 04:26.795
I expected them to fight.

04:26.846 --> 04:28.597
Right now,
we're getting our ass kicked.

04:28.664 --> 04:30.432
Well, what scorecard
are you looking at,

04:30.499 --> 04:33.135
because we just got them
to give up half their war chest

04:33.186 --> 04:34.352
just to stay in the fight.

04:34.437 --> 04:36.157
I don't give a shit
what the scorecard says.

04:36.189 --> 04:37.272
I want a knockout.

04:37.339 --> 04:38.557
Well, it doesn't work
that way.

04:38.641 --> 04:39.608
It can if you hit them
below the belt.

04:39.675 --> 04:40.842
- Logan--
- Save it.

04:40.893 --> 04:43.028
When my father went up
against Carl Icahn,

04:43.112 --> 04:44.863
he said that you waited
till he wasn't looking,

04:44.947 --> 04:47.515
you walked up behind him,
and you shot him in the back.

04:47.567 --> 04:49.951
Walter Gillis
isn't Carl Icahn.

04:50.019 --> 04:52.154
I'm not talking
about Walter Gillis.

04:52.205 --> 04:54.022
I'm talking about Mike Ross.

04:54.073 --> 04:55.624
I don't care
who you're talking about.

04:55.691 --> 04:57.993
That Icahn deal
was completely different.

04:58.044 --> 05:01.630
The only difference I see
is that this deal

05:01.697 --> 05:03.582
is against your surrogate son.

05:03.666 --> 05:08.803
So are you willing to do this
or not?

05:09.972 --> 05:11.640
You want below the belt?

05:11.707 --> 05:14.242

05:54.594 --> 05:56.878
Louis,
we talked about this.

05:56.930 --> 06:00.566
It's just so weird to see him
in my old office, you know?

06:00.650 --> 06:03.268
It's like when you drive
by the house you grew up in,

06:03.353 --> 06:04.853
and there's another family
in there,

06:04.904 --> 06:06.522
and all you want to do is
break in and make yourself soup.

06:06.573 --> 06:07.856
You know that feeling?

06:07.907 --> 06:09.057
Well,
it depends on the soup.

06:09.108 --> 06:11.193
- Mushroom barley.
- Then no.

06:11.244 --> 06:12.828
Hey, did you get him
that apology gift

06:12.895 --> 06:14.329
I told you to get him?

06:14.397 --> 06:15.764
Except instead of scotch,
I got us two front-row tickets

06:15.832 --> 06:17.366
to the ballet.

06:17.417 --> 06:18.834
Oh.

06:18.901 --> 06:21.703
Well,
it's the thought that counts.

06:21.754 --> 06:23.922
Louis, can I help you
with something?

06:24.007 --> 06:25.174
Yes.

06:25.241 --> 06:29.011
You and me,
we got off on the wrong foot.

06:29.078 --> 06:33.098
Words were said,
hurtful caricatures were drawn,

06:33.183 --> 06:34.600
and I did some bad things too.

06:34.684 --> 06:36.385
Water under the bridge, Louis.

06:36.436 --> 06:37.803
Well, no, not to me.

06:37.887 --> 06:42.191
See, um, I once was told
that actions have consequences,

06:42.258 --> 06:45.777
and I want to turn things around
by inviting you...

06:47.730 --> 06:50.532
to the American Ballet Company's
production of <i>Giselle.</i>

06:50.600 --> 06:52.401
The ballet?

06:52.452 --> 06:55.003
Yeah,
you and me tonight.

06:55.071 --> 06:56.288
Wow.

06:56.372 --> 06:58.073
Louis, I would love to go
to the ballet with you.

06:58.124 --> 07:01.293
I really would, but I have
Knicks tickets tonight, man,

07:01.377 --> 07:02.911
and I never miss a game.

07:02.962 --> 07:04.796
All right, I'm gonna let it go
that you're choosing basketball

07:04.881 --> 07:07.716
over <i>Giselle,</i> but I really need
to make this up to you, Jeff.

07:07.783 --> 07:08.800
I can't be in the red.

07:08.885 --> 07:11.553
I am always,
always in the black,

07:11.621 --> 07:13.121
and I don't mean that
in a racial sense.

07:13.172 --> 07:16.592
Well, now that you mention it,
I could really use some advice.

07:18.628 --> 07:19.728
About a case?

07:19.795 --> 07:21.430
About Jessica.

07:21.481 --> 07:23.732
I just pulled Adam Grieves
as opposing counsel.

07:23.799 --> 07:25.434
And long story short,
he hates me,

07:25.485 --> 07:27.965
and I could really use Jessica's
help to run some interference,

07:27.987 --> 07:31.156
but I'm the new guy,
it's only my second case,

07:31.241 --> 07:33.808
and I don't know
what to do.

07:33.860 --> 07:35.340
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

07:35.411 --> 07:37.479
I'm gonna get you
front-row tickets

07:37.530 --> 07:39.948
to Jessica Pearson's help.

07:43.870 --> 07:45.420
Okay, Harvey, you didn't
bring me here to make me

07:45.488 --> 07:47.039
choke down
these brussels sprouts.

07:47.123 --> 07:49.174
No, I didn't,
but you are going to have

07:49.259 --> 07:51.293
to choke down
something else.

07:51.344 --> 07:53.011
Let me guess.
This is about Walter Gillis.

07:53.096 --> 07:54.429
No, it's not about Walter.

07:54.497 --> 07:56.048
It's about the line of credit

07:56.132 --> 07:57.349
that you're about to stop
giving him.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.217
And why on earth
would I do that?

07:59.302 --> 08:01.520
Because if you don't,
I have a feeling

08:01.604 --> 08:03.338
that every
Pearson Specter client

08:03.389 --> 08:05.440
that you currently
do business with,

08:05.508 --> 08:07.859
suddenly gonna move
their accounts to Chase.

08:07.944 --> 08:10.178
You really want to cripple
his company that badly?

08:10.229 --> 08:11.697
His company's already dead.

08:11.781 --> 08:13.014
He just doesn't know it yet.

08:13.066 --> 08:14.950
That doesn't give you
the right to threaten me.

08:15.017 --> 08:17.569
If I were threatening you,
I'd come right out and say it.

08:17.654 --> 08:19.821
If you don't do this,
tomorrow morning,

08:19.872 --> 08:22.991
you lose $2 billion
worth of deposits.

08:23.042 --> 08:24.493
You son of a bitch.

08:24.544 --> 08:25.961
That he is.

08:26.028 --> 08:28.213
- What are you doing here, Mike?
- What do you mean?

08:28.298 --> 08:30.365
I just came
for the brussels sprouts.

08:30.416 --> 08:32.200
You know how I know
how good they are?

08:32.251 --> 08:33.467
How?

08:33.535 --> 08:34.803
Because this is where Harvey
brings bankers

08:34.870 --> 08:36.590
to strong-arm them
into doing some bullshit.

08:36.673 --> 08:38.539
- Don't listen to him.
- No, he should listen to me.

08:38.591 --> 08:41.559
I'm Walter Gillis' partner,
and if he cuts off our funding

08:41.644 --> 08:43.979
at any point in the next two
months following this lunch,

08:44.046 --> 08:45.981
then the next time
you're talking about

08:46.048 --> 08:48.900
these brussels sprouts will be
in front of a grand jury.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.722
Oh, Vernon,
don't take it personally.

08:53.773 --> 08:55.453
He did the same thing
to the guy from Leeds

08:55.491 --> 09:00.195
at the exact same table
seven months ago.

09:08.454 --> 09:11.239
Louis, I got your memo,

09:11.290 --> 09:13.291
and if you want to get
an antique diving bell

09:13.376 --> 09:16.712
for your new office,
it's on your dime.

09:16.763 --> 09:18.930
Okay, that's bullshit,
but whatever.

09:19.015 --> 09:20.415
I'm here about Jeff Malone.

09:20.466 --> 09:21.916
I am not the principal.

09:21.968 --> 09:24.252
You two are gonna have to work
your shit out on the playground.

09:24.303 --> 09:25.887
But you see,
that's just it.

09:25.938 --> 09:27.556
We already did.

09:27.623 --> 09:29.924
Something's not right.

09:29.976 --> 09:31.259
Why are you here?

09:31.310 --> 09:33.562
I'm here because you need
to run interference.

09:33.613 --> 09:35.480
I thought you just said
you worked it out.

09:35.565 --> 09:37.866
No, not with me,
with Adam Grieves at the S.E.C.

09:37.933 --> 09:39.484
He has it in for Malone.

09:39.569 --> 09:41.770
Louis, I'm glad you two
are going to be

09:41.821 --> 09:44.239
walking to school together
from now on,

09:44.290 --> 09:47.942
but I hired Jeff Malone
to handle the S.E.C.,

09:47.994 --> 09:52.798
not to get me to handle them
for him.

09:52.882 --> 09:55.950
You know, you're always
telling me not to make enemies,

09:56.002 --> 09:59.337
and for the first time
since Harvey,

09:59.422 --> 10:01.173
I have just made a new friend,

10:01.257 --> 10:05.093
so I'm asking you...

10:07.263 --> 10:08.463
Please do it for my friend.

10:08.514 --> 10:09.815
Louis--

10:09.899 --> 10:13.185
if you won't do it for him,
please do it for me.

10:15.655 --> 10:18.156
I just had a very interesting
chat with Louis Litt.

10:18.241 --> 10:20.475
Louis is
a very interesting guy.

10:20.526 --> 10:22.327
Did you know he's never eaten
an olive?

10:22.412 --> 10:25.030
I did not, but I do know
you fed him some bullshit.

10:25.114 --> 10:26.634
- That doesn't sound like me.
- Really?

10:26.649 --> 10:28.283
'Cause he thinks we need
to work together

10:28.334 --> 10:30.495
because there's bad blood
between you and Adam Grieves.

10:30.536 --> 10:31.787
I don't like
to talk about it.

10:31.838 --> 10:33.338
Of course not,
because you and Adam Grieves

10:33.423 --> 10:35.624
play basketball every Wednesday.

10:35.675 --> 10:38.009
What happens on the court,
Jessica, stays on the court.

10:38.094 --> 10:41.880
And I thought I was clear
about boundaries.

10:41.964 --> 10:43.348
Well, listen,
if that's really how you feel,

10:43.433 --> 10:45.350
why don't you just tell Louis
that you want to bow out

10:45.435 --> 10:49.221
because you don't trust yourself
around me?

10:49.305 --> 10:52.173
Yeah, I didn't think so.

10:52.225 --> 10:56.978
See you tomorrow.

10:59.849 --> 11:01.349
What happened to going
below the belt?

11:01.400 --> 11:02.684
I went below the belt.

11:02.735 --> 11:05.237
The referee stepped in and threw
a grand jury at my face.

11:05.321 --> 11:06.571
Well, I wasn't asking you
to go below the belt

11:06.656 --> 11:07.906
with the company.

11:07.990 --> 11:09.908
I was asking you to go
below the belt with Ross.

11:09.992 --> 11:11.192
What are you talking about?

11:11.244 --> 11:12.994
I'm saying you hire
a private investigator

11:13.045 --> 11:14.663
to find every skeleton
in his closet.

11:14.714 --> 11:16.965
He wakes up in the morning, and
it's all over the front page.

11:17.032 --> 11:18.552
Logan, that's not going
below the belt.

11:18.634 --> 11:19.701
That's just nuts.

11:19.752 --> 11:21.253
You're full of shit.

11:21.337 --> 11:23.171
You don't want to do this,
because you don't have

11:23.222 --> 11:24.556
the stomach to do it
to your boy.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.475
No, I don't want to do it,
because we're on a path

11:26.542 --> 11:28.927
to win this thing,
and I let you bait me into doing

11:29.011 --> 11:30.771
what I already did
because I thought you were

11:30.847 --> 11:32.481
just a little impatient.

11:32.548 --> 11:35.317
But now I'm starting to realize
what it really is.

11:35.384 --> 11:36.384
What is that?

11:36.385 --> 11:39.070
Who's full of shit now?

11:39.155 --> 11:41.055
This has nothing to do
with Rachel.

11:41.107 --> 11:43.859
You got there
pretty damn fast.

11:43.910 --> 11:47.061
Hey, I asked you to put
Mike Ross down with one punch.

11:47.113 --> 11:49.664
You said you would,
and you didn't.

11:49.732 --> 11:53.401
So either do what I'm asking,
or I'll do it myself.

12:05.014 --> 12:06.681
You can't do it, Harvey.

12:06.749 --> 12:07.933
Yes, I can.

12:08.017 --> 12:09.384
Logan's gonna do it anyway.

12:09.435 --> 12:10.752
At least this way it'll be me.

12:10.803 --> 12:12.521
What's the difference
if you hire somebody

12:12.588 --> 12:14.472
to look into Mike
or Logan does?

12:14.557 --> 12:16.597
You know damn well they're gonna
uncover his secret.

12:16.609 --> 12:18.476
I don't know that,
and you don't either.

12:18.561 --> 12:21.095
- Yeah, I do.
- No one's ever found it before.

12:21.147 --> 12:22.814
Because you were hiding it
from people

12:22.899 --> 12:25.200
who weren't looking for it,
not from people who are.

12:25.267 --> 12:29.788
What do you want from me,
Donna?

12:29.872 --> 12:31.940
I want you to get Mike
to give up.

12:31.991 --> 12:33.274
Well, I'm not gonna do that,

12:33.326 --> 12:34.943
because I know
he's not gonna give up.

12:34.994 --> 12:37.379
- How do you know that?
- Because I know.

12:37.446 --> 12:38.780
This is Mike
we're talking about.

12:38.831 --> 12:40.448
If it were anyone
other than Mike,

12:40.499 --> 12:42.617
I'd have an article
in the Journal tomorrow.

12:42.668 --> 12:44.252
That's not what
you told Logan.

12:44.303 --> 12:46.922
Because I goddamn lied
to Logan, and it didn't work.

12:46.973 --> 12:50.058
Now I'm gonna do
what I have to do.

12:50.125 --> 12:53.228
Well, the least you can do
is warn him.

12:53.295 --> 12:54.429
He's on the other side.

12:54.480 --> 12:55.630
I'm not gonna warn him.

12:55.681 --> 12:58.299
That's not how it works.

13:00.770 --> 13:02.404
Well, maybe you should think
of something

13:02.471 --> 13:04.406
that won't ruin
his goddamn life.

13:12.743 --> 13:13.830
Hey.

13:14.451 --> 13:16.135
You ready to get down
to business?

13:16.219 --> 13:17.637
- Yes, I am.
- Good.

13:17.721 --> 13:20.172
I was thinking that maybe we
could do all this over lunch.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.507
It's 10:30.

13:21.591 --> 13:23.175
There's a lot to discuss,
Jessica.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.061
No, there isn't.

13:25.128 --> 13:26.628
We need to bury them
in paperwork.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.897
No, we don't.

13:27.964 --> 13:29.398
We just need to come up
with a legitimate reason

13:29.466 --> 13:30.516
why Brooks
made that trade.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.851
There is no legitimate reason.

13:31.935 --> 13:33.352
I didn't say there needs
to be one, Jessica.

13:33.437 --> 13:34.737
I said we need to find one.

13:34.804 --> 13:37.606
You are taking to defense
like a fish to water.

13:37.658 --> 13:38.941
Well, you didn't bring me
in here

13:38.992 --> 13:41.027
just for my genetically superior
bone structure, did you?

13:41.111 --> 13:43.746
Mm, no, that's what
I brought him in for.

13:43.813 --> 13:47.533
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I was just getting up to speed.

13:47.617 --> 13:48.751
You brought Louis in.

13:48.818 --> 13:50.252
Of course.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.989
Three heads are better than two,
unless you have an objection?

13:54.041 --> 13:55.124
No.

13:55.175 --> 13:56.509
Are you kidding me?

13:56.593 --> 13:59.295
I would never turn down
a threesome, right, buddy?

13:59.346 --> 14:00.846
I hear you.

14:00.931 --> 14:04.166
Good, because Jessica and I
were just having

14:04.217 --> 14:06.385
a little difference of opinion
about what to do next.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.021
Yes, and I'm sure Louis,
the man that I hired,

14:09.106 --> 14:12.308
the man who owes
his very career to me,

14:12.359 --> 14:13.675
will see things my way.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.511
Well, I don't want to step
on anyone's toes.

14:15.562 --> 14:18.314
No, Louis, you're not stepping
on anyone's toes here,

14:18.365 --> 14:21.016
and to be fair, I think
you're an amazing attorney

14:21.068 --> 14:22.485
who doesn't owe anyone anything.

14:22.536 --> 14:24.653
Ooh, do you work out?

14:24.705 --> 14:27.406
Oh, I-I try to stay fit.

14:27.491 --> 14:28.908
Try?

14:28.992 --> 14:30.326
Mission accomplished.

14:30.377 --> 14:32.294
Can we get to the point?

14:32.362 --> 14:34.029
Lou?
Louis?

14:34.081 --> 14:36.749
Jeff and I have two different
approaches to this case.

14:36.833 --> 14:39.135
Exactly, go for the knockout
punch or bore them to death.

14:39.202 --> 14:40.702
Oh, well,
when you frame it that way--

14:40.754 --> 14:42.972
I can't believe you're using
that old debate team trick.

14:43.039 --> 14:44.423
Farm boy strong.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.541
That's what you are.

14:45.592 --> 14:47.476
Jessica,
what debate team trick?

14:47.544 --> 14:49.762
Calling my approach
"Bore them to death"

14:49.846 --> 14:51.180
and yours "A knockout punch."

14:51.231 --> 14:52.314
Man, you're really good
at this.

14:52.382 --> 14:54.183
Are you--
have you done this before?

14:54.234 --> 14:55.551
Sure have.

14:55.602 --> 14:57.820
Look, Jessica, you can make
assumptions about how

14:57.887 --> 15:00.222
this farm boy's gonna come down
on this all you want to,

15:00.273 --> 15:04.443
but I think we all pretty much
know he's playing on my team.

15:05.895 --> 15:07.663
Jeff, you're right.

15:07.730 --> 15:09.115
You are right, and in fact,

15:09.199 --> 15:11.200
I think that,
because you and Louis

15:11.251 --> 15:15.538
see eye to eye on this case,
that you should work together,

15:15.589 --> 15:16.622
and I should bow out.

15:16.706 --> 15:18.624
You actually think
that bothers me?

15:18.708 --> 15:23.712
Because now I've this farm boy
all to myself, Jess.

15:23.764 --> 15:25.264
Just you and me, cowboy.

15:25.348 --> 15:28.050
It's like Ernie and Bert.

15:29.853 --> 15:31.053
Jeff Malone is in love
with me.

15:31.087 --> 15:32.138
What?

15:32.222 --> 15:33.422
I was just in a meeting
with him,

15:33.473 --> 15:35.113
and he started off
by patting my shoulder.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.525
He's a jock, Louis.

15:36.593 --> 15:37.726
That's just how they are.

15:37.778 --> 15:39.645
No, he was then rubbing
my shoulders.

15:39.729 --> 15:40.946
Then he touched my arm.

15:41.031 --> 15:42.064
He's all over me.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.149
Wow.
What was that meeting about?

15:43.233 --> 15:44.483
It doesn't matter.

15:44.568 --> 15:47.536
Donna, his arguments are loaded
with double meaning.

15:47.604 --> 15:50.272
Who invokes the penal code
in an S.E.C. case?

15:52.042 --> 15:54.443
He said "penal"?

15:54.494 --> 15:55.611
Three times.

15:55.662 --> 15:57.213
The third time,
we were just talking about

15:57.280 --> 15:59.048
the Glass-Steagall act,
which is purely civil, and it--

15:59.115 --> 16:00.549
God damn it, woman,
do I have to draw you a map?

16:00.617 --> 16:01.750
I mean,
come to think of it,

16:01.802 --> 16:03.636
athletes coming out
is all the rage now.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.788
And guess what his favorite
sport is: Basket...Ball.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.091
Oh, my God.

16:09.142 --> 16:10.226
Shut the front door.

16:10.293 --> 16:11.573
No,
I want to shut the back door.

16:11.628 --> 16:13.012
Okay, Louis,

16:13.096 --> 16:16.599
now that we've firmly
established his gayness,

16:16.650 --> 16:17.850
why would he think you're gay?

16:17.851 --> 16:19.301
I mean, you're...

16:19.352 --> 16:22.071
Straight as an arrow.

16:23.824 --> 16:25.625
I may have said
that I eat cock for breakfast,

16:25.642 --> 16:26.909
lunch, and dinner.

16:26.976 --> 16:28.077
What?

16:28.144 --> 16:29.612
It was a different kind
of cock, Donna.

16:29.663 --> 16:33.082
Okay, Louis, what exactly
do you want from me?

16:33.149 --> 16:34.867
I want you to tell me
what I should do about it.

16:34.951 --> 16:36.952
I'm gonna tell you exactly
what you're gonna do about it:

16:37.003 --> 16:38.037
Nothing.

16:38.121 --> 16:39.242
What do you mean, "nothing"?

16:39.289 --> 16:40.706
I mean don't give him
anything back.

16:40.790 --> 16:42.491
He'll get the message.
It'll pass.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.805
Donna, I don't think
you understand the power

16:46.847 --> 16:50.633
of my sexuality.

16:50.684 --> 16:52.101
What are you doing?

16:52.168 --> 16:54.409
Oh, you know, it's just a
little something for your file.

16:54.437 --> 16:56.188
I have a file?

16:56.273 --> 16:57.806
That information
is classified.

16:57.858 --> 16:59.808
- Wait, why?
- It's in your file.

16:59.860 --> 17:01.618
Oh, shit.

17:15.157 --> 17:17.025
Harvey Specter.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.627
If you'd be more comfortable,
I have a couple rocks

17:19.695 --> 17:21.079
you could crawl out from under.

17:21.164 --> 17:23.883
Most people would go with some
tall weeds I could hide behind.

17:23.967 --> 17:25.501
Most people don't take
these fights personally.

17:25.551 --> 17:27.803
I do.
That's exactly why I'm here.

17:27.869 --> 17:29.421
Meaning?

17:29.506 --> 17:31.473
I came here to tell you
something man-to-man,

17:31.541 --> 17:33.342
because I know what this company
means to you.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.983
If you knew what this company
meant to me,

17:35.044 --> 17:37.930
you wouldn't be trying
to steal it.

17:38.014 --> 17:41.650
Walter,
I know how your son died.

17:41.718 --> 17:43.652
Get the hell out of my office.

17:43.720 --> 17:48.657
Not before I tell you that
Mike Ross was a drug dealer.

17:48.725 --> 17:52.060
Bullshit he was,
and I'm calling security,

17:52.112 --> 17:53.895
and if you're not gone
by the time they get here,

17:53.947 --> 17:56.064
their job's going to be
getting me off you.

17:56.116 --> 17:58.900
Fine, I'll go,
but ask him.

17:58.952 --> 18:01.086
Ask him if he ever dealt drugs.

18:01.171 --> 18:04.790
Ask him if he ever refused
to take a drug test.

18:04.874 --> 18:06.908
Ask him if he was ever high
at work.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.127
I said, "get out."

18:08.211 --> 18:10.012
And ask him
if on the very day he came to me

18:10.079 --> 18:13.933
looking for a job he had a
briefcase filled with marijuana.

18:15.585 --> 18:20.472
This is how you do this,
come here "man-to-man"

18:20.557 --> 18:25.644
and use my son's death
to take my company from me?

18:25.729 --> 18:29.782
Well, you are nothing
but a piece of shit.

18:31.534 --> 18:33.869
You're right.
I am a piece of shit.

18:33.936 --> 18:38.123
But that doesn't make what
I'm telling you any less true.

18:48.918 --> 18:50.419
Walter,
what are you doing here?

18:50.470 --> 18:52.254
I'm having second thoughts.

18:52.305 --> 18:54.056
About the takeover.

18:54.123 --> 18:56.225
About you.

18:56.292 --> 18:57.509
I'm sorry.
I don't understan--

18:57.594 --> 18:59.961
Have you ever been involved
in a drug deal?

19:04.017 --> 19:05.851
Walter, look, I'm trying to save
your company here.

19:05.935 --> 19:07.436
And I'm here to find out
what kind of man

19:07.487 --> 19:10.439
I'm in business with,
so I'm going to ask you again.

19:10.490 --> 19:12.775
Have you ever been involved
in a drug deal?

19:21.785 --> 19:24.003
What did Harvey tell you?

19:24.087 --> 19:25.587
Looks like he told me
the truth.

19:25.655 --> 19:27.790
The truth is that Harvey
can't beat us,

19:27.841 --> 19:30.092
so he's trying to divide us, and
he's using your son to do it.

19:30.159 --> 19:32.327
Just like you used his memory
to make you my partner.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.129
To save your life's work.

19:34.180 --> 19:37.099
Another lie from another liar.

19:37.166 --> 19:38.467
You two deserve each other.

19:38.518 --> 19:41.470
We're done.

19:49.446 --> 19:51.513
- Mike, are you okay?
- I don't care who you find.

19:51.564 --> 19:53.899
I want you to hire someone to
get every piece of dirt there is

19:53.983 --> 19:55.117
on Logan Sanders.

19:55.184 --> 19:56.568
- Uh--
- Just do it.

19:56.653 --> 19:57.653
Where are you going?

19:57.704 --> 19:59.822
To take care
of something else.

20:05.139 --> 20:07.014
Couple things.
It's Porter birthday.

20:07.015 --> 20:09.200
I got him that weird zucchini
cake he likes from the Bronx.

20:09.285 --> 20:10.285
What cake?

20:10.352 --> 20:11.903
Somebody returned
Stutman's chair.

20:11.987 --> 20:13.404
It was missing?

20:13.489 --> 20:16.074
And the "no questions asked"
memo in the kitchen worked.

20:16.158 --> 20:18.243
- What did it stop?
- Mm, it's not important.

20:18.327 --> 20:19.744
None of these things
are important.

20:19.828 --> 20:21.796
Oh, and one more thing.

20:21.863 --> 20:24.299
Louis thinks Malone
is in love with him.

20:24.366 --> 20:26.134
Your secret's safe.

20:26.201 --> 20:30.538
And you're welcome.

20:32.975 --> 20:34.926
Hey, Louis,
do you have a minute?

20:35.010 --> 20:37.478
Well, it's about all I have,
'cause I'm super, super busy.

20:37.546 --> 20:39.306
Yeah, well, listen,
I just wanted to check in

20:39.348 --> 20:41.266
and see if you're ready
to pull an all-nighter.

20:41.350 --> 20:42.734
I just got
all the brokerage tapes in,

20:42.818 --> 20:44.435
and I figure we could just
grind it out.

20:44.520 --> 20:45.603
Tonight?

20:45.688 --> 20:47.689
Tonight,
unless you want to go right now

20:47.740 --> 20:48.990
and just pound it out
all at once.

20:49.057 --> 20:50.241
Okay,
that's it.

20:50.326 --> 20:51.726
I mean,
you have got this all wrong.

20:51.727 --> 20:56.397
Jeff,
I like you...as a friend.

20:56.448 --> 20:58.666
Right, Louis.

20:58.734 --> 21:00.735
I like you too.

21:00.786 --> 21:02.453
I think I've made that
perfectly clear.

21:02.538 --> 21:05.340
Too clear, man,
too clear.

21:05.407 --> 21:07.047
I mean, enough
with the come-ons, already.

21:07.092 --> 21:08.576
- What?
- Yeah, I mean, I get it.

21:08.627 --> 21:10.762
You know, we're a perfect match,
you know,

21:10.846 --> 21:12.297
if you go that way,
ebony and ivory.

21:12.381 --> 21:15.133
But I play
a different instrument, so...

21:15.217 --> 21:16.884
Oh, Louis, no--

21:16.935 --> 21:18.720
Look, I--
look, it's just that--

21:18.771 --> 21:20.605
I just don't--
I don't want there to be,

21:20.689 --> 21:23.391
you know, just awkwardness,
especially since Jessica

21:23.442 --> 21:25.443
just bowed out,
and it's just me and you now.

21:25.527 --> 21:27.094
Right.

21:29.765 --> 21:33.234
Well, now that you've seen
right through me, Louis,

21:33.285 --> 21:37.705
I...I am disappointed.

21:37.773 --> 21:39.791
Are you gonna be okay?

21:39.875 --> 21:42.460
To be honest, I'm feeling
a little raw right now.

21:42.544 --> 21:44.712
Oh, shit.

21:46.498 --> 21:48.049
I'm sorry.

21:48.116 --> 21:49.717
Maybe it's best
if you just told Jessica

21:49.785 --> 21:51.219
that she needs to step back in.

21:51.286 --> 21:53.638
- Yes.
- Yeah.

21:53.722 --> 21:55.640
Can do, yeah.

21:58.143 --> 21:59.677
Get up.

21:59.762 --> 22:01.128
You here to fight me?

22:01.180 --> 22:02.513
Oh, should I wait for you
to turn your back?

22:02.598 --> 22:03.898
That seems to be
more your speed.

22:03.965 --> 22:06.234
I'm sorry, were you
expecting me to give you a call?

22:06.301 --> 22:08.269
No, I was expecting you to be
a human being.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.638
From where I'm sitting,
I was a goddamn saint.

22:10.689 --> 22:12.139
Oh, yeah?
How's that?

22:12.191 --> 22:13.808
If I didn't do what I did,
Logan was gonna hire

22:13.859 --> 22:16.778
a private investigator to
smear you up and down the block.

22:16.829 --> 22:18.663
- So what?
- You know what.

22:18.747 --> 22:22.500
I shot you in the knees, so he
wouldn't shoot you in the face.

22:22.584 --> 22:23.835
You're welcome.
You know what, Harvey?

22:23.919 --> 22:25.319
I'm gonna take pass
on the thank-you

22:25.371 --> 22:26.587
and instead skip right
to the part where I call you

22:26.655 --> 22:27.672
a piece of shit.

22:27.756 --> 22:28.840
You know what?

22:28.924 --> 22:30.604
I'm getting a little tired
of hearing that.

22:30.626 --> 22:32.593
And what does that make you
for threatening to bring

22:32.661 --> 22:34.128
criminal charges
in that restaurant?

22:34.179 --> 22:35.513
You deserved criminal charges

22:35.597 --> 22:37.277
for what you were doing
in that restaurant.

22:37.332 --> 22:38.716
You didn't have a problem
when we did it

22:38.801 --> 22:40.184
seven months ago
to the guy from Leeds.

22:40.269 --> 22:43.003
Seven months ago, you weren't
lying to somebody about me.

22:43.055 --> 22:44.889
I didn't lie,
and seven months ago,

22:44.973 --> 22:48.109
you were goddamn here.

22:48.176 --> 22:50.645
So that's what this is about.

22:50.696 --> 22:52.397
You can't stand
that I got out of here

22:52.481 --> 22:54.181
and that I'm succeeding
without you.

22:54.233 --> 22:56.651
Without me?

22:56.702 --> 22:58.453
I made you.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.187
Without me,
you're nothing.

23:00.239 --> 23:02.206
Right there.

23:02.291 --> 23:04.625
That's who you are,
and that's why I left.

23:04.693 --> 23:06.794
Bullshit.
Don't lay that on me.

23:06.862 --> 23:09.547
You left because you needed
to feed that huge ego.

23:09.631 --> 23:12.049
Ego?
Ego?

23:12.134 --> 23:14.201
If I stayed here, you know what
would have been hanging

23:14.253 --> 23:16.170
over my head for the rest
of my life.

23:16.221 --> 23:18.256
Which is why I told you
to move somewhere

23:18.340 --> 23:19.540
nobody ever knew you.

23:19.591 --> 23:22.543
But you stayed here,
so that thing is still

23:22.594 --> 23:24.879
over your goddamn head,
and I stopped it.

23:24.930 --> 23:27.265
I don't care what you think
you stopped.

23:27.349 --> 23:28.716
You're gonna go
to Walter Gillis,

23:28.767 --> 23:30.435
and you're gonna make
this thing right.

23:30.519 --> 23:31.519
It is right.

23:31.553 --> 23:32.887
It's over.
You lost.

23:32.938 --> 23:34.822
Nothing's over.

23:34.890 --> 23:36.657
And you're the one who lost
something today.

23:36.725 --> 23:38.075
What are you talking about?

23:38.160 --> 23:40.611
You went personal.
I went personal.

23:40.696 --> 23:44.248
Your father's master tapes...
I've got 'em.

23:47.085 --> 23:50.087
Those tapes have nothing to do
with this deal.

23:51.924 --> 23:54.425
They do now.

23:59.882 --> 24:03.351
Harvey...

24:03.418 --> 24:04.418
I did this.

24:04.419 --> 24:06.354
- What?
- The tapes.

24:06.421 --> 24:09.056
Mike found out about them
from me.

24:09.107 --> 24:11.227
I've been meeting him for coffee
just because I wanted

24:11.259 --> 24:13.260
to make sure that everything
was okay between the two of you,

24:13.312 --> 24:16.697
and I never, ever thought that
he would do something like this.

24:16.765 --> 24:19.099
I'm so, so sorry.

24:19.151 --> 24:22.987
It's not your fault, Donna.

24:23.071 --> 24:24.906
- What are you gonna do?
- Nothing.

24:24.957 --> 24:26.607
The tapes have nothing to do
with this deal.

24:26.658 --> 24:30.495
The second I believe they do,
I'm done.

24:30.579 --> 24:32.880
Ugh,
perfect timing.

24:32.948 --> 24:34.081
Do you want me
to get rid of him?

24:34.132 --> 24:36.617
I'll handle it.

24:38.504 --> 24:40.788
What part of
"drag Mike Ross through the mud"

24:40.839 --> 24:42.390
did you not understand?

24:42.457 --> 24:44.337
The part where you come off
looking like a rich,

24:44.393 --> 24:45.510
vindictive douche bag.

24:45.594 --> 24:46.894
That's not your call to make.

24:46.962 --> 24:49.897
Based on your years
of experience in takeovers?

24:49.965 --> 24:52.066
Here's something they didn't
teach you in snowboarding school

24:52.133 --> 24:53.150
or wherever the hell you went

24:53.235 --> 24:55.135
before you decided to be
a grown-up.

24:55.187 --> 24:57.438
Never destroy anyone in public

24:57.489 --> 24:59.941
when you can accomplish
the same result in private.

24:59.992 --> 25:01.242
Meaning?

25:01.309 --> 25:03.194
I severed Mike's ties
with Walter Gillis.

25:03.278 --> 25:04.812
It's over.

25:04.863 --> 25:06.943
You know, you told me
that Mike Ross wasn't a threat,

25:06.949 --> 25:08.499
and then he handcuffed us
with a T.R.O.

25:08.584 --> 25:10.618
You said that you'd
take him down with one blow,

25:10.669 --> 25:12.152
and then he got back up.

25:12.204 --> 25:15.339
So here's something that I did
learn in snowboarding school.

25:15.424 --> 25:18.209
When someone talks shit,
I demand proof.

25:18.293 --> 25:19.493
Proof of what?

25:19.545 --> 25:21.879
Logan, we won.
You don't need--

25:21.964 --> 25:23.163
Need to what?

25:23.215 --> 25:25.833
Come off like a rich,
vindictive douche bag?

25:25.884 --> 25:28.352
I want proof
that he's giving up his bid,

25:28.437 --> 25:29.770
and if I don't get it
by the morning,

25:29.838 --> 25:31.439
I'm gonna call
my private investigators,

25:31.506 --> 25:34.859
and I'm gonna finish
what I started.

25:46.165 --> 25:47.449
Where are you going?

25:47.533 --> 25:48.783
Where do you think I'm going?

25:48.868 --> 25:50.669
To get Mike to sign an agreement
to give up his bid.

25:50.736 --> 25:52.037
You can't.

25:52.088 --> 25:53.088
Why not?

25:53.089 --> 25:54.089
Because you were right.

25:54.090 --> 25:55.924
He's never gonna listen to you.

25:56.008 --> 25:58.343
Donna, I know you're feeling
bad about the tapes, but--

25:58.410 --> 25:59.628
That has nothing to do
with it.

25:59.712 --> 26:01.096
Then what are you saying?

26:01.180 --> 26:03.882
I feel guilty that I told him,
but what he did,

26:03.933 --> 26:05.851
that's on you.

26:05.918 --> 26:07.598
And the reason he's not gonna
listen to you

26:07.603 --> 26:09.087
is because you acted like
an asshole.

26:09.138 --> 26:10.472
Excuse me?

26:10.556 --> 26:12.057
He came in here
wanting an explanation

26:12.108 --> 26:15.760
for why you did what you did,
and you threw gas on the fire.

26:15.811 --> 26:17.929
I gave him an explanation.

26:17.980 --> 26:21.733
Yeah,
you told him he was nothing.

26:21.784 --> 26:23.235
You know what?

26:23.286 --> 26:25.370
About a half an hour ago, you
told me this was all your fault.

26:25.437 --> 26:28.039
A half an hour ago,
I was thinking about what I did.

26:28.107 --> 26:29.991
I wasn't thinking
about what you said to him.

26:30.076 --> 26:31.609
It doesn't matter
what I said to him.

26:31.661 --> 26:34.663
I saved him.

26:34.747 --> 26:37.632
Harvey, you said before
if it had been anybody

26:37.717 --> 26:39.918
other than Mike, you would have
done what Logan wanted

26:39.969 --> 26:41.219
without blinking an eye.

26:41.287 --> 26:43.889
Well, if anybody other than Mike
had walked in here

26:43.956 --> 26:46.958
the way he did,

26:47.009 --> 26:49.227
you would have shown him
the tiniest bit of compassion.

26:49.295 --> 26:51.563
He bought those tapes
before he ever walked in here.

26:51.630 --> 26:55.150
Those tapes were not the first
thing that he told you about,

26:55.234 --> 26:56.735
but he made damn sure
they were the last.

26:56.802 --> 26:59.604
So you just flagged me down
to call me an asshole?

26:59.655 --> 27:00.638
No, I flagged you down
to tell you

27:00.690 --> 27:02.691
that he's not gonna listen
to you,

27:02.775 --> 27:05.243
but he might listen
to somebody else.

27:09.315 --> 27:10.832
Just heard from Louis.

27:10.917 --> 27:12.284
He has the stomach flu,

27:12.335 --> 27:13.985
so I'm gonna have to step in
tonight.

27:14.036 --> 27:16.154
Oh,
that's too bad.

27:16.205 --> 27:18.206
This wouldn't have anything
to do with him thinking

27:18.291 --> 27:19.925
you're in love with him,
would it?

27:19.992 --> 27:21.126
No idea.

27:21.177 --> 27:22.660
Feel like Sushi?

27:22.712 --> 27:24.829
Jeff, you can play
all the games that you want,

27:24.880 --> 27:27.132
but an all-night review
of the evidence

27:27.183 --> 27:28.967
is a waste of my time.

27:29.018 --> 27:30.852
So why don't you get
a couple of associates?

27:30.937 --> 27:33.305
And I will see you
in the morning.

27:33.356 --> 27:37.508
Listen, if you don't want
to be here, that's fine.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.010
But I am gonna do this
by myself,

27:39.061 --> 27:40.979
because I don't have associates
do my work.

27:41.030 --> 27:42.364
And why is that?

27:42.448 --> 27:44.566
Do you really want
to know why?

27:48.020 --> 27:52.190
Dalton Foster was a con man
who somehow convinced

27:52.241 --> 27:55.160
terminally ill people to sign
over their insurance policies.

27:55.211 --> 27:57.695
Anyway,
he was my first big case,

27:57.747 --> 28:00.131
so I decided
that I would get some help

28:00.199 --> 28:04.836
going through the evidence,
just like this.

28:04.887 --> 28:06.972
The help screwed up.

28:07.039 --> 28:08.590
Dalton Foster walked.

28:08.674 --> 28:12.227
Six months later,
he pulled the exact same scam.

28:12.311 --> 28:14.095
Only this time,
the problem was,

28:14.180 --> 28:17.816
one of his dying clients
had a miraculous recovery.

28:17.883 --> 28:22.553
So one day, Dalton came up
from behind her...

28:23.856 --> 28:26.491
And he beat her to death
with an aluminum bat.

28:28.527 --> 28:30.912
So am I glad you're here,
Jessica?

28:30.997 --> 28:32.330
Yes.

28:32.398 --> 28:33.915
Did I take advantage of Louis?

28:34.000 --> 28:35.333
Absolutely.

28:35.401 --> 28:38.620
I may play games
to get us together,

28:38.704 --> 28:42.374
but I never play games
with a case.

28:42.425 --> 28:44.676
Never.

28:51.417 --> 28:53.601
You have a minute?

28:53.686 --> 28:54.769
This must be serious.

28:54.854 --> 28:56.021
Why is that?

28:56.088 --> 28:57.722
Because you usually
just tell me what to do.

28:57.773 --> 29:00.108
Remember when you said
if I want you to deliver

29:00.192 --> 29:02.260
a message to Mike,
I should come to you directly?

29:05.064 --> 29:06.731
You want me to get him
to give up.

29:06.782 --> 29:08.817
If Mike doesn't give up
tonight,

29:08.901 --> 29:10.652
Logan is gonna hire someone
to dig up

29:10.736 --> 29:13.655
everything they can on him.

29:13.739 --> 29:16.124
That's why you went to Gillis.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.742
You had no choice.

29:17.793 --> 29:20.545
That's not the way
Mike saw it.

29:20.612 --> 29:23.331
You know, you could have come
to me before you did that.

29:23.416 --> 29:25.500
I'm coming to you now.

29:27.720 --> 29:28.753
How do I bill it?

29:28.804 --> 29:30.338
The same way
we bill everything.

29:30.423 --> 29:33.224
Say it took twice as long
as it did.

29:43.769 --> 29:45.653
Okay, I take it back.

29:45.738 --> 29:46.971
My strategy?

29:47.022 --> 29:49.157
My strategy isn't
"knockout punch."

29:49.241 --> 29:51.309
We should've called it
"needle in a haystack."

29:51.360 --> 29:52.777
Getting frustrated?

29:52.828 --> 29:55.947
This guy?
This guy does not shut up.

29:55.998 --> 29:57.449
I now know
about his bronchitis,

29:57.500 --> 29:59.284
his problems
with his dry cleaner,

29:59.335 --> 30:01.369
but absolutely no explanation
whatsoever

30:01.454 --> 30:02.787
about why he cashed out.

30:02.838 --> 30:04.822
Oh, you mean besides
being tipped that he invested

30:04.874 --> 30:06.174
in a giant Ponzi scheme.

30:06.258 --> 30:08.042
Wait.

30:08.127 --> 30:09.461
What?

30:09.512 --> 30:11.463
It's a call with an analyst
predicting a downturn

30:11.514 --> 30:14.382
in small-cap stocks
in the next quarter.

30:14.467 --> 30:18.887
Listen.

30:25.227 --> 30:27.812
The Ponzi fund was made up
of small-cap stocks.

30:27.863 --> 30:32.117
That's a legit reason for him
to have cashed out.

30:32.184 --> 30:35.904
Exactly what we need to get
the charges dropped.

30:35.988 --> 30:38.907
And exactly the kind of call
a junior attorney

30:38.991 --> 30:43.161
might have missed.

30:43.212 --> 30:45.296
So do you see why we needed
to do this together?

30:45.364 --> 30:46.915
Yes, I see.

30:56.809 --> 30:59.394
What is it?

31:04.316 --> 31:07.769
I have responsibilities that you

31:07.853 --> 31:10.071
just don't want to understand.

31:10.156 --> 31:12.607
No, I don't.

31:12.691 --> 31:16.528
I am the only woman partner

31:16.579 --> 31:18.947
at this level in the city.

31:19.031 --> 31:21.732
If word got out
that I hired a partner

31:21.784 --> 31:23.251
that I was
in a relationship with--

31:23.335 --> 31:25.069
What, you'd be disbarred?

31:25.120 --> 31:29.624
You think this is a joke.

31:29.708 --> 31:33.678
I think you're making excuses
for keeping me out of your life,

31:33.745 --> 31:35.430
Jessica,
and I'm calling you on it.

31:35.514 --> 31:36.965
Oh, what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

31:37.049 --> 31:40.435
It means that I'm making you
a promise, all right,

31:40.519 --> 31:42.604
that no one--no one will ever
find out about us,

31:42.688 --> 31:45.723
so if that's what
you're really afraid of,

31:45.774 --> 31:48.059
if that's what's truly
holding you back,

31:48.110 --> 31:50.195
then it is off the table.

31:56.318 --> 32:00.488
I'm sorry.

32:15.421 --> 32:17.955
Hey, so I know we said

32:18.007 --> 32:19.624
we're not supposed to talk
about the deal--

32:19.675 --> 32:22.844
Why did you lie to me?

32:25.898 --> 32:28.182
What are you talking about?

32:31.520 --> 32:33.104
When I asked you
about you and Logan,

32:33.155 --> 32:37.242
you said that you ended it.

32:37.309 --> 32:40.695
According to this,
you swore it was him.

32:44.833 --> 32:47.752
This is my deposition
from his divorce.

32:52.991 --> 32:54.542
You read this?
Why--why would--

32:54.627 --> 32:58.513
He looked into me.
I looked into him.

32:58.597 --> 32:59.797
This is looking into me.

32:59.865 --> 33:02.100
You still haven't answered
the question.

33:02.167 --> 33:04.052
Mike,
I told you the truth.

33:04.136 --> 33:08.106
Logan was trying to patch
things up with his wife,

33:08.173 --> 33:10.775
and he asked me to back
his story, so I did.

33:10.842 --> 33:15.647
You lied for him.

33:15.698 --> 33:17.699
You loved him that much.

33:18.901 --> 33:20.118
I told you that I loved him.

33:20.185 --> 33:23.738
Yeah,
but you didn't tell me that.

33:23.822 --> 33:25.490
And I've been sitting here
all night

33:25.541 --> 33:28.042
wondering why you wouldn't...

33:30.162 --> 33:32.797
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

33:40.255 --> 33:42.890
I'm gonna tell you now.

33:44.677 --> 33:48.396
We had an affair.

33:48.480 --> 33:53.401
We fell in love,
and he wanted to marry me,

33:53.485 --> 33:57.322
and I said no,

33:57.389 --> 34:01.409
and then three months later,
he had a change of heart,

34:01.493 --> 34:03.161
and he wanted to get back
with his wife

34:03.228 --> 34:05.446
during his divorce proceedings,
so he asked me to help him,

34:05.531 --> 34:10.001
and I did.

34:10.068 --> 34:13.254
But when he wanted to marry me,
I said no,

34:13.339 --> 34:17.759
because he wasn't the man
I want to spend my life with.

34:17.842 --> 34:20.762
You are.

34:34.476 --> 34:35.943
I love you.

34:36.027 --> 34:38.946
I love you too.

34:54.857 --> 34:56.241
Surprise.

34:56.324 --> 34:57.526
What? What?
You have to go.

34:57.577 --> 34:58.610
- What are you talking about?
- She's here.

34:58.695 --> 35:01.830
Logan,
is there somebody at the door?

35:01.897 --> 35:03.699
Just...

35:03.750 --> 35:06.568
I am, um...
I'm from Pearson Hardman,

35:06.619 --> 35:09.738
and I--I had a few files
to bring your husband.

35:11.507 --> 35:13.875
Where are they?

35:13.926 --> 35:16.595
They're--they're right here.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.630
Um...

35:21.684 --> 35:23.251
Get out.

35:23.302 --> 35:24.636
Allison,
what the hell?

35:24.721 --> 35:26.054
It is 7:30 in the morning.

35:26.105 --> 35:27.522
You think I'm an idiot?

35:27.590 --> 35:28.671
What are you talking about?

35:28.691 --> 35:29.924
I know that that's her.

35:29.976 --> 35:31.426
God,
I told you I'm not--

35:31.477 --> 35:33.361
Stop lying to me.

35:33.429 --> 35:35.480
At least be a man
and admit that that's her.

35:35.565 --> 35:36.982
I don't even know that girl,
okay?

35:37.066 --> 35:38.650
And you think that if I was
having an affair

35:38.735 --> 35:42.604
that I would have it with a
paralegal from my father's firm?

35:58.054 --> 35:59.721
Rachel.

35:59.789 --> 36:02.057
I want you to stop
the personal attacks on Mike.

36:02.124 --> 36:03.458
I know.
It sounds terrible, but--

36:03.509 --> 36:04.760
And it's how the game
is played.

36:04.811 --> 36:05.977
I don't care.

36:06.062 --> 36:09.147
I want you to stop.

36:09.232 --> 36:12.517
Look, can we talk
about this inside, please?

36:18.474 --> 36:19.775
I understand that you--

36:19.826 --> 36:22.861
No, look,
you say you're a changed man,

36:22.945 --> 36:26.448
but what you're doing now, it's
not a change for the better.

36:26.499 --> 36:27.816
It's for the worse.

36:27.867 --> 36:29.584
You told me
this wasn't gonna be a problem.

36:29.652 --> 36:34.589
And you stood right here
and told me

36:34.657 --> 36:36.792
that you didn't love your wife.

36:36.843 --> 36:38.844
And then three months later,

36:38.928 --> 36:42.831
you asked me to lie for you,
so you could get her back.

36:42.882 --> 36:44.382
Rachel--

36:44.467 --> 36:48.270
You don't have to stop this
because you're some changed man.

36:48.337 --> 36:51.807
You have to stop this, Logan,
because you owe me.

36:57.196 --> 36:59.447
Okay.

37:00.650 --> 37:03.451
Okay.

37:09.125 --> 37:10.408
Louis.

37:10.493 --> 37:12.878
Listen, I was up late,
I haven't had my coffee,

37:12.962 --> 37:16.581
so can we talk about whatever
this is in, like, an hour?

37:16.666 --> 37:18.700
I'll be quick.

37:18.751 --> 37:20.335
I ran into your enemy
this morning.

37:20.386 --> 37:22.838
You remember Adam Grieves?

37:22.889 --> 37:25.807
He asked me to tell you
that you guys

37:25.875 --> 37:27.092
are still on for ball
on Wednesday.

37:27.176 --> 37:28.310
Listen, Louis--

37:28.377 --> 37:30.395
Everything you told me,
it was bullshit.

37:30.479 --> 37:33.481
You're not trying to get
into my pants.

37:33.549 --> 37:36.268
You're trying to get
into Jessica's.

37:36.352 --> 37:38.219
You thought you could move
your way up the ladder,

37:38.271 --> 37:41.189
and you used my friendship
to cozy up to her.

37:41.240 --> 37:42.741
Louis,
that's just not true.

37:42.825 --> 37:45.660
Well, then, what is it?

37:45.728 --> 37:49.197
Why did you lie to me
to get me off this case?

37:55.571 --> 37:59.875
Tell me what I'm missing here,
Jeff.

38:04.046 --> 38:06.014
That's what I thought.

38:06.081 --> 38:07.716
Louis, please--

38:07.767 --> 38:11.052
For once I let my guard down
and believed that someone

38:11.103 --> 38:14.356
genuinely liked me
without a hidden agenda.

38:17.310 --> 38:21.029
I will not make that mistake
again.

38:33.659 --> 38:37.162
I'm here to see Mike Ross.

38:37.246 --> 38:39.280
What the hell are you
doing here?

38:39.332 --> 38:41.833
I came to see you.

38:41.918 --> 38:43.919
I have a meeting.

38:43.970 --> 38:47.806
I came to apologize.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.624
For what?

38:49.675 --> 38:52.227
For trying to win dirty.

38:52.294 --> 38:56.264
I can't undo what I've already
done, but I can stop doing it.

38:56.315 --> 39:00.568
I don't want to win that way.

39:00.636 --> 39:02.354
That sounds like something
your publicist

39:02.438 --> 39:05.907
would tell <i>Forbes.</i>

39:05.975 --> 39:09.361
Why don't you tell me
why you're really here?

39:09.445 --> 39:13.114
You want the truth?

39:13.165 --> 39:16.701
I don't want to hurt Rachel.

39:38.340 --> 39:40.976
Walter.

39:41.027 --> 39:42.844
I have nothing
to say to you.

39:42.895 --> 39:45.280
Walter, please.

39:45.347 --> 39:46.898
You have 30 seconds.

39:46.983 --> 39:50.151
Okay,
look, I get it.

39:50.202 --> 39:51.820
I tried to tell you
there's more to the story.

39:51.871 --> 39:53.021
You didn't want to hear it then,

39:53.072 --> 39:54.456
and you don't want
to hear it now.

39:54.523 --> 39:56.524
But you need to hear this.

39:56.575 --> 39:58.460
Whether you like me or not,

39:58.527 --> 39:59.828
I am the only one
in your corner,

39:59.879 --> 40:02.580
and you know it.

40:02.665 --> 40:07.168
I started this company
with no one to trust but myself.

40:07.219 --> 40:09.220
That's how I go out,

40:09.305 --> 40:10.805
so be it.
We're done.

40:10.873 --> 40:12.090
Well,
I'm sorry to hear that,

40:12.174 --> 40:14.559
because I'm gonna be
in your corner anyway.

40:14.643 --> 40:17.145
I just bought another 2%
of your stock,

40:17.212 --> 40:19.481
which means
I'm saving your company

40:19.548 --> 40:22.817
with or without you.

40:24.904 --> 40:28.723
Time's up.
I don't want to see you again.

40:49.178 --> 40:50.912
Jeff, it's late.

40:50.963 --> 40:55.767
It's not about us.

40:55.851 --> 40:57.018
Woodall.

40:57.086 --> 40:59.020
It started.

40:59.088 --> 41:00.722
How many?

41:00.773 --> 41:03.141
Seven clients,
seven subpoenas,

41:03.225 --> 41:05.810
all coming tomorrow.

41:08.531 --> 41:11.733
It's time for you
to start earning your money.

41:28.584 --> 41:30.785
You get me a present?

41:30.836 --> 41:33.338
It's from Mike.

41:36.308 --> 41:37.759
It's my dad's tapes.

41:37.810 --> 41:41.012
He said they're yours.

41:41.097 --> 41:42.764
