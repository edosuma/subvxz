00:44.166 --> 00:46.959
With Halloween a week away,
I thought we'd celebrate

00:47.041 --> 00:50.500
by growing our very
own Vitis Odor Mortis.

00:50.583 --> 00:53.542
The Smell of Death Vines.

00:54.375 --> 00:55.500
Hmm?

00:55.583 --> 00:57.834
-(sniffing)
-Smells like old man breath.

00:57.917 --> 00:59.667
I was gonna go with meat farts.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.000
Follow these directions exactly.

01:02.083 --> 01:04.750
Or your plant will look like me.

01:04.834 --> 01:06.500
Two cups of water per day.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.458
One scoop of plant food every hour.

01:08.542 --> 01:12.125
Alternate sunlight and shade...
No, this is way too complicated.

01:12.208 --> 01:14.458
-It's a plant.
-I know.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.208
Let's just put all the water
and plant food in now.

01:18.083 --> 01:20.959
Howard, we just outsmarted nature.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.875
(Howard groaning)

01:24.959 --> 01:26.667
There are no extra plants in here.

01:26.750 --> 01:29.667
Oh, we're getting an "F."
There's nothing worse than an "F!"

01:29.750 --> 01:32.083
We get an "F" and there's no way
our folks will let us go

01:32.166 --> 01:34.291
to the Whoopee World
Fright-tacular tonight.

01:34.375 --> 01:35.750
I made this costume for nothing.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.834
Speaking of costumes,
I'm half a cow, right?

01:37.917 --> 01:40.291
-And you're a guy who tries to kill me.
-Uh-huh.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.375
You were supposed to be
the front half of a cow!

01:42.458 --> 01:46.166
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry, but Viceroy's got style.

01:49.125 --> 01:52.083
So, class starts in five.
How are you gonna fix this?

01:52.166 --> 01:54.709
I can't fix this.
I don't know how to raise the dead.

01:54.792 --> 01:57.000
I'll bet your Ninja Know-It-All does.

01:57.083 --> 01:59.166
Okay, the NinjaNomicon
is an 800-year-old book

01:59.250 --> 02:02.458
of ancient warrior wisdom,
not a book of science shortcuts.

02:02.542 --> 02:03.458
Four minutes.

02:03.542 --> 02:06.959
You want to spend Halloween
at the Fright-tacular, or grounded?

02:07.041 --> 02:08.208
(muttering)

02:11.083 --> 02:13.208
-Uh-huh.

02:21.834 --> 02:23.875
"Forbidden knowledge
of the Shadow Warrior.

02:25.500 --> 02:26.583
Hmm.

02:29.667 --> 02:31.458
Invisibility, no. Flying, no.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.291
Telepathy, no. Ah, here it is.

02:33.375 --> 02:35.000
The Ninja Art of Healing.

02:35.083 --> 02:36.500
Yes!

02:37.333 --> 02:39.041
Whoa. Really?

02:39.125 --> 02:41.875
I got about three minutes here.
Can I get, like, the quickie version?

02:42.500 --> 02:44.834
All right, recite koan.
Mm-hmm, that's easy.

02:44.917 --> 02:47.083
Invert healing energy.
I got it, etcetera and so forth,

02:47.166 --> 02:50.125
and skipping to the end,
life is restored. Got it!

02:51.125 --> 02:54.083
(shouting)

02:54.166 --> 02:56.041
-You got it?
-Uh, yeah, kinda.

02:56.125 --> 02:57.375
It was a lot of steps.

02:57.458 --> 02:59.583
We... Correction, you,
got like one minute.

02:59.667 --> 03:00.834
Get crackin'!

03:05.041 --> 03:07.291
Art of healing, laying hands.
Mm-hmm, uh-huh.

03:07.375 --> 03:12.458
Art of heal... (Randy shouting) My hands!
I can't control them!

03:12.542 --> 03:15.125
Nothing is safe! Nothing is safe!

03:15.208 --> 03:17.208
-(groaning)
-Ooh.

03:18.792 --> 03:20.834
It'll be worth it when we're
at Whoopee World, and...

03:20.917 --> 03:22.291
-Oh, come on!
-Ow!

03:22.375 --> 03:23.208

03:36.250 --> 03:37.291

03:37.375 --> 03:39.291
"R?" That's worse than an "F!"

03:40.625 --> 03:42.750
Are you ready to die?

03:45.417 --> 03:47.250
(all screaming)

03:49.375 --> 03:52.834
Gerry. You're alive!

03:54.375 --> 03:57.917
Is it possible that you might have, um,
skipped a step?

03:58.750 --> 04:02.041
-Doomsday is coming!
-(farting)

04:02.125 --> 04:03.959

Oh, you got me.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.041
Just ribbin' ya'.

Ninja Bone Dodge, Ninja BD!

04:31.250 --> 04:32.500
Ninja Slip, Ninja Slip.

04:34.291 --> 04:36.000
(shouting) Oh, no. Stairs!

04:37.333 --> 04:38.750
See you around.

04:39.542 --> 04:40.959
Howard? Howard!

04:41.041 --> 04:43.375
-Oh.
-I need your help.

04:43.458 --> 04:47.000
Where'd your husband take that young man
whose name I do not know?

04:47.083 --> 04:50.959
I wish I knew, Ninja.
Mr. D has always had a secretive side.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.083
Been that way since college.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.291
Ah. College.

04:55.375 --> 04:58.834
(Mrs. D) <i>Gerry was first</i>

<i>Gerry was brilliant.</i>

(Randy) <i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Doomsday Device?</i>

05:11.208 --> 05:14.083
Okay, so is that how he,
you know, he has bones?

05:14.166 --> 05:17.917
-Oh, no. That's actually a funny story.
-Back to the Doomsday Device!

05:18.000 --> 05:21.875
(Mrs. D) <i>One night,</i>
<i>MSU's number two student -betrayed him.</i>

05:33.792 --> 05:35.375
Get a job!

Smiles, Hannibal.

05:37.083 --> 05:39.917
We're projecting a positive
image, don't ya' know?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.166
Another Ninja? How original.

05:43.250 --> 05:46.291
Uh, I mean, enjoy these McFizzles.

05:46.375 --> 05:48.667
(all chattering)

05:50.458 --> 05:53.750
(Howard) For a guy with no muscles,
you're surprisingly strong.

05:55.250 --> 06:01.125
Whoa. You will have a front row seat
as I complete my greatest invention,

06:01.208 --> 06:04.208
and take first in our class, Viceroy.

06:04.291 --> 06:05.750
-Whoa, hang on.
-Huh?

06:05.834 --> 06:06.834
You think I'm Viceroy?

06:06.917 --> 06:09.583
Ah, look at me, I'm not an adult.

06:10.875 --> 06:12.667
You're not Viceroy!

06:12.750 --> 06:16.417
So, can I get, like, a ride home, or...

06:16.500 --> 06:18.458
I'm going to destroy your home.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.417
-And your home's home.
-Home's home?

06:20.500 --> 06:24.208
I'm going to destroy the planet!

06:25.667 --> 06:28.667
Stupid kids sitting in
a pumpkin patch all night.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.208
There's no such thing as the Great...

06:30.291 --> 06:31.750
-Viceroy.
-Ninja!

06:31.834 --> 06:34.667
-Just need to talk.
-(blowing whistle)

06:38.709 --> 06:41.834
Gerry... Driscoll... is... alive!

06:42.792 --> 06:44.333
Actually, sorta alive.

06:44.417 --> 06:46.250
Really a mix of alive and not alive.

06:46.333 --> 06:47.792
The point is, he's back and...

06:47.875 --> 06:49.834
(both) He wants to finish
his Doomsday Device.

06:49.917 --> 06:51.500
Right, no, yeah.
You got it, you said it.

06:51.583 --> 06:54.333
And because of our history,
only I can find him.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.709
-Hello, Marlene.
-Willem.

07:00.792 --> 07:03.709
So, Doomsday Device.
What's the deal there?

07:03.792 --> 07:08.125
Proof of functioning Doomsday Device
guarantees you valedictorian at MSU.

07:08.208 --> 07:09.834
<i>Summa cum lunatic.</i>

07:09.917 --> 07:12.959
But the only way to prove it's functioning
is to destroy the world.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.583
Ah, yes. The Driscoll Conundrum.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.083
And you married that wacko?

07:17.750 --> 07:19.291
I like dangerous men.

07:20.959 --> 07:22.166
(Viceroy) Back up, back up.

07:23.125 --> 07:25.166
There, under the gift shop.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.000
-Wait here, Mrs. Driscoll.
-But...

07:27.083 --> 07:30.500
-It could be dangerous.
-But I like that.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.166
(laughing)

07:33.250 --> 07:34.875
(Randy) Smoke bomb!

07:34.959 --> 07:37.041
(Gerry) Hello, Ninja.

07:37.125 --> 07:40.959
-Hey!
-And real Viceroy.

07:41.041 --> 07:43.208
Gerry. I see the diet worked.

07:43.291 --> 07:48.917
So glad you're here, to witness
my superior brain.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.583
(laughing maniacally)

07:50.667 --> 07:53.875
(machine) <i>Earth will be</i>
<i>destroyed in two minutes.</i>

07:53.959 --> 07:55.542
(grunts)

07:57.625 --> 07:59.792
Not if I have anything to say about it.

07:59.875 --> 08:03.583
Oh, boy. Not if Viceroy has
anything to say about it.

08:03.667 --> 08:05.834
Lot of science in here.

08:07.709 --> 08:10.875
Ooh, and who is this
stylish young fellow?

08:11.542 --> 08:13.041
You even got the glasses right.

08:13.125 --> 08:14.709
Viceroy!

08:14.792 --> 08:15.834
(groaning)

08:15.917 --> 08:17.667
I'm gonna need about 20 hours.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.875
(machine) <i>One minute, 42 seconds.</i>

08:21.875 --> 08:23.542
You got a minute 42.

08:26.959 --> 08:28.208
How do you like me now, homie?

08:28.291 --> 08:31.500
(laughs) I'm armed and dangerous!

08:31.583 --> 08:33.333
(machine) <i>59 seconds.</i>

08:34.750 --> 08:37.333
-Why don't you just unplug it?
-Because it's nuclear-powered.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.333
Wearing a lab coat doesn't
make you a scientist.

08:40.417 --> 08:41.959
(both grunting)

08:42.041 --> 08:43.291
Huh?

08:43.375 --> 08:45.709
Ninja Table Spin Kick!

08:48.667 --> 08:51.834
A-ha! I've got a bone to pick with you.

08:51.917 --> 08:53.750
(giggling) Oh, Gerry.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.000
Hi!

08:57.083 --> 08:58.583
-(groans)
-Heads up.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.291
Ha! Good one.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.208
(shouting)

09:02.875 --> 09:04.083
Put me back, put me back!

09:04.166 --> 09:06.000
How does the bowtie stay on?
That makes no sense.

09:06.083 --> 09:07.667
It's over, Gerry.

09:07.750 --> 09:12.709
But I didn't blow up the world.
How will I ever be valedictorian?

09:12.792 --> 09:14.542
They named a valedictorian.

09:15.542 --> 09:17.458
(alarm sounding)

09:17.542 --> 09:19.417
And besides, if you blow up the world...

09:19.500 --> 09:21.542
We won't be together anymore.

09:21.625 --> 09:24.625
-Are you crazy?
-Crazy for this bag of bones.

09:25.917 --> 09:27.875
No! No.

09:27.959 --> 09:29.333
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.625
Put me by the scanner.

09:31.709 --> 09:33.291
(machine) <i>Ten seconds.</i>

09:34.792 --> 09:36.458
<i>Completing retina scan.</i>

09:36.542 --> 09:39.125
- <i>ID match.</i>
-Deactivate.

09:39.208 --> 09:41.125
But he doesn't have retinas.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.750
-So, that happened.
-Oh, Gerry.

09:46.834 --> 09:51.375
Now that you're back, we're going to do
so many wonderful things together.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.875
Yup! Frying the Earth is small potatoes.

09:53.959 --> 09:57.291
I'm just dying to get going on my Destroy
the Universe machine.

09:57.375 --> 10:00.125
And after I mash the whole Universe...

10:00.208 --> 10:02.250
On second thought,
maybe we're all better off

10:02.333 --> 10:04.000
if we go back to how things were.

10:04.083 --> 10:05.250
Destroy them all!

10:05.333 --> 10:06.667
Hey, what are you do...

10:07.583 --> 10:08.417
Howard.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.125
(clearing throat)

10:12.917 --> 10:14.333
(whirring)

10:14.417 --> 10:16.208
I know Randy and I kinda
blew it on the plant,

10:16.291 --> 10:18.792
but seeing how your husband
almost killed me,

10:18.875 --> 10:20.417
maybe you can hook us up
with an "A?"

10:20.500 --> 10:22.375
-I'll give you a "C."
-Same thing.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.625
(groaning)

10:25.709 --> 10:27.542
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.834
I know, he was too dangerous.

10:29.917 --> 10:32.542
At least now he won't complain
about taking me dancing.

10:32.625 --> 10:35.500
Aw, but I've got two left feet.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.583
(humming)

10:42.583 --> 10:44.166
(giggling)

10:44.250 --> 10:46.792
Oh! Gerry, don't get fresh.

10:46.875 --> 10:48.959
Can you blame me, hot stuff?

10:49.583 --> 10:51.875
(smooching)

10:51.959 --> 10:54.083
That's scarier than
anything we're gonna see

10:54.166 --> 10:55.166
at the Fright-tacular.

10:55.250 --> 10:58.166
Cunningham, we really learned
an important Halloween lesson.

10:58.250 --> 11:01.583
Yeah, not to take shortcuts.
Especially when raising the dead.

11:01.667 --> 11:05.542
Uh, no.
McFist gives out awesome candy.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.834
You know, you're lucky
it only worked on Mr. D.

11:08.917 --> 11:10.709
That lab's full of dead stuff.

11:10.792 --> 11:13.250
Dissection frogs, dissection cats,

11:13.333 --> 11:15.917
and a ton of weird junk in jars.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.583
Welcome to the Whoopee World
Fright-tacular.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.083
By entering this house of horrors,

11:23.166 --> 11:25.667
you agree that Whoopee World,
a wholly-owned subsidiary

11:25.750 --> 11:28.417
of McFist Industries, Inc.
shall not be held liable

11:28.500 --> 11:30.834
for terror-induced
tremors, pants wetting,

11:30.917 --> 11:34.750
or uncontrollable fear farts.
Have a Fright-tatic night. (inhales)

11:34.834 --> 11:37.959
Fear farts? What kind of shoobs
does this guy take us for?

11:38.041 --> 11:41.083
Seriously. If I'm gonna rip one,
it's to get a laugh.

11:41.166 --> 11:43.959
Speaking of.
Cunningham, pull my finger.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.000
-(farting)
-Gross.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.875
Hey, Theresa. Debbie Kang.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.875
Looks like we're riding together.

11:50.959 --> 11:53.375
I heard this ride is totally terrifying.

11:53.417 --> 11:55.291
Hope you boys can handle it.

11:55.375 --> 11:59.417
Please, Debbie Kang. We're guys.
Guys don't get scared.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.709
(evil laughter)

12:02.792 --> 12:04.792
(all screaming)

12:04.875 --> 12:07.291
That was not age-appropriate.

12:07.375 --> 12:09.250
(whimpers) I'm still shaking.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.667
I gotta be straight with you girls.
I think I peed a little.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.291
What about you, Randy?

12:13.375 --> 12:16.000
-I was, um...
-He wasn't scared.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.458
Guys don't get scared, right, Randy?

12:19.542 --> 12:22.083
Scared, yeah. I was not scared.

12:22.166 --> 12:25.333
I mean, I was so not scared,
I laughed through most of it.

12:25.417 --> 12:27.667
-I was just laughing.
-That's not true.

12:27.750 --> 12:29.750
Wow. You are so hardcore.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.625
-I am. I really am.
-(Howard grumbling)

12:31.709 --> 12:32.959
That's not true either.

12:33.041 --> 12:35.125
Listen, I know this sounds stupid, but...

12:35.208 --> 12:38.709
That ride was really freaky.
Would you walk us home?

12:38.792 --> 12:40.542
I would be delighted.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.417
They don't call me
Hardcore Cunningham for nothing.

12:43.500 --> 12:44.834
They don't call you that.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.917
-(evil laughter)
-(shrieks)

12:48.000 --> 12:48.959
Wait up!

12:52.208 --> 12:53.709
-(McFist humming)
-(ringing)

12:53.792 --> 12:55.250
Oh, Hannibal, could you get that?

12:55.333 --> 12:58.834
(groans) This is the last mooch
we're feeding tonight, Marci.

12:58.917 --> 13:00.125
Last one!

13:01.834 --> 13:03.750
Hmm? (mutters)

13:03.834 --> 13:05.375
Hello?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.458
Candy!

13:10.542 --> 13:12.000
Stop sneaking up on me!

13:12.083 --> 13:13.625
We have a little situation.

13:13.709 --> 13:15.375
-Yeah, how little?
-Huge.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.959
Remember when you combined
the top secret weapons division

13:18.041 --> 13:20.041
with the consumer candy division?

13:20.125 --> 13:21.166
Yeah, of course I remember.

13:21.250 --> 13:24.208
Costs down, revenues up.
Best idea I ever had.

13:24.291 --> 13:25.792
Except that it wasn't.

13:25.875 --> 13:27.583
There's something you need to see.

13:29.834 --> 13:32.500
Admit it, Cunningham.
You were scared. You had to be.

13:32.583 --> 13:34.125
You're the biggest scaredy-baby I know.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.333
I'm not a scaredy-baby.
If anyone's a scaredy-baby,

13:36.417 --> 13:37.875
-it's gotta be you.
-(Debbie screams)

13:37.959 --> 13:39.667
I thought I saw something.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.542
You're holding my hand.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.667
I mean, yo, that's cool, baby.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.041
Howard, you want to get in on this?

13:47.583 --> 13:49.166
Have you all gone mad?

13:49.250 --> 13:51.083
He's acting brave to try to impress you.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.500
I would have done the same thing
if I'd have thought of it.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.041
-(howling)
-(all gasping)

13:55.125 --> 13:57.500
Uh, if Howard's not gonna hold that hand,

13:57.583 --> 13:58.625
I'll take it.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.625
Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm.

14:00.709 --> 14:03.625
This is an act. And I'm gonna prove it.

14:03.709 --> 14:04.750
Go for it.

14:04.834 --> 14:08.333
Some of us are scaredy-babies,
and some of us are me.

14:08.417 --> 14:10.750
-(grumbling)
-(Randy humming)

14:14.458 --> 14:15.917
Candy!

14:18.625 --> 14:20.542
Let me get this straight.

14:20.625 --> 14:23.000
The sludge that was supposed to
go to the McBoom-Boom Factory

14:23.083 --> 14:24.792
went to the McYum-Yum Factory.

14:24.875 --> 14:26.125
Mm-hmm.

14:26.208 --> 14:27.542
Well, what happened to the sludge

14:27.625 --> 14:29.834
that was supposed to go to
the McYum-Yum Factory?

14:33.667 --> 14:36.959
Ooh, not bad.
I fail to see the problem.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.667
The problem is McFizzles
have been weaponized,

14:39.750 --> 14:42.542
turning anyone who eats them
into a candy-crazed, ultra-vicious,

14:42.625 --> 14:43.875
unstoppable zombie!

14:45.458 --> 14:46.792
(trilling)

14:47.709 --> 14:48.750
(munching)

14:48.834 --> 14:49.709
(growling)

14:49.792 --> 14:50.792
Congratulations.

14:50.875 --> 14:53.917
You've created a confection
of mass destruction.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.917
Proud of yourself for that one?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.542
A little. (chuckling)

14:58.959 --> 15:02.125
(Randy chuckling) I mean,
who knows why I'm so brave?

15:02.208 --> 15:05.583
Maybe I have an under-active fear gland,
or extra-bravery chromosomes.

15:05.667 --> 15:08.834
The important thing is,
while you're with me, you're safe, baby.

15:08.917 --> 15:11.125
-(grumbling and gasping)
-(bird cawing)

15:13.041 --> 15:14.583
You're right, Cunningham.

15:14.667 --> 15:16.959
You're not scared of anything.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.500
You're so brave.

15:18.583 --> 15:21.083
I bet you could cut through
this spooky cemetery.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.500
Alone.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.750
-I could.
-Then do it.

15:24.834 --> 15:26.291
Fine, I'm doing it.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.750
-Good, go.
-Good. I'm gone.

15:31.041 --> 15:34.291
I am not missing my curfew for this.
Let's get outta here.

15:35.834 --> 15:36.834
Just admit it.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.750
You're a great big scaredy-baby.

15:38.834 --> 15:40.625
I'll tell the girls and you
don't have to do this.

15:40.709 --> 15:44.125
Please, I'm the Ninja.
I fight monsters and robots all the time.

15:44.208 --> 15:45.208
I'm not scared.

15:45.291 --> 15:47.166
Then you won't mind if I
hang onto the Ninja Mask

15:47.250 --> 15:49.166
-until you're done?
-Mind?

15:49.250 --> 15:50.583
By all means.

15:53.417 --> 15:55.583
-(humming)
-(howling)

15:55.667 --> 15:58.667
-(whimpering)
-(owl hooting)

15:58.750 --> 16:01.417
Yeah, don't worry, ladies.
This won't take long.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.709
He'll come screaming back any sec...

16:03.792 --> 16:05.333
(gasping) Theresa?

16:05.417 --> 16:06.792
Debbie Kang?

16:06.875 --> 16:08.166
-Cunningham?
-(shattering)

16:08.250 --> 16:10.166
-(thunder cracking)
-(whimpering)

16:10.250 --> 16:13.041
-(rustling)
-I'm not scared!

16:13.125 --> 16:15.125
-Why are you screaming?
-Why are you following me?

16:15.208 --> 16:18.000
The girls ditched us and I was all alone,
so I came in here.

16:18.083 --> 16:19.959
Which I'm beginning to regret.

16:20.041 --> 16:22.000
(girl screaming)

16:22.083 --> 16:23.875
(stammering) Ghost!
That's a honkin' ghost!

16:25.542 --> 16:26.792
-(Debbie) Ow!
-I did it!

16:26.875 --> 16:30.667
I killed a ghost.
Oh, man, I've never felt more alive.

16:30.750 --> 16:31.750
I'm not a ghost!

16:31.834 --> 16:34.166
Theresa! You scared the juice out of...

16:34.250 --> 16:37.083
...Howard. Just Howard,
and I'm very brave.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.959
(zombie) Candy!

16:39.041 --> 16:40.583
I don't know what happened.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.375
We were walking home,
eating candy, and well...

16:43.458 --> 16:45.709
-That.
-Candy!

16:45.792 --> 16:47.875
(all growling) Candy!

16:47.959 --> 16:49.542
Randy, what do we do?

16:49.625 --> 16:51.125
Yeah, Randy.

16:51.208 --> 16:53.291
-What do we do?
-You guys get outta here.

16:53.375 --> 16:55.083
-(whimpering)
-Get moving, Fowler.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.792
Zombies. Okay, I can handle this.

16:56.875 --> 17:00.333
Or should I say the Ninja...
...Mask is with Howard.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.667
-(shrieks)
-Candy!

17:02.750 --> 17:04.750
You know what I like about her?
She's got the deets.

17:04.834 --> 17:07.375
<i>What up, N-ville?</i>
<i>It's Heidi Hallo-Weinerman,</i>

17:07.458 --> 17:09.166
<i>coming at you</i>
<i>with some breaking deets.</i>

17:09.250 --> 17:10.792
<i>Zombies are hot this year.</i>

17:10.875 --> 17:12.917
<i>They're everywhere.</i>
<i>Literally everywhere.</i>

17:13.000 --> 17:14.834
<i>Everywhere you look there are zombies.</i>

17:14.917 --> 17:18.625
According to my calculations,
the city will be overrun in 24 hours.

17:18.709 --> 17:21.917
How to fix this? How to fix this.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.250
I got nothing!

17:24.333 --> 17:27.000
I do have a Doomsday Device
in the hovercraft.

17:27.083 --> 17:31.625
But that would mean wiping Norrisville
from the face of the Earth. (snickering)

17:31.709 --> 17:33.083
Seems a little drastic.

17:33.166 --> 17:35.709
<i>This zombie report is brought</i>
<i>to you by McFizzles.</i>

17:35.792 --> 17:37.583
<i>McFizzle to the max!</i>

17:37.667 --> 17:38.875
<i>Mmm!</i>

17:43.500 --> 17:44.709
To the hovercraft!

17:44.792 --> 17:46.291
(thunder cracking)

17:46.375 --> 17:48.583
-(panting)
-(Howard) No, no!

17:48.667 --> 17:50.709
-Howard!
-Candy!

17:50.792 --> 17:52.583
(whimpering)

17:52.667 --> 17:54.000
(Howard) It's horrible!

17:54.083 --> 17:57.333
-Huh? Howard!
-(Howard) No!

17:58.834 --> 18:02.000
There was a hole in my bag.
All my candy's gone.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.375
Gone! (sobbing)

18:04.458 --> 18:06.917
I'll give you half my McFizzles
if you stop crying.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.041
-(sniffing) Okay.
-Howard, you have... something I need.

18:11.125 --> 18:13.750
Forget it. I earned these McFizzles.

18:13.834 --> 18:16.208
No, no, no. I mean my face... hat.

18:16.291 --> 18:18.625
Theresa, what's that
zombie thing you're doing?

18:18.709 --> 18:19.959
Candy!

18:20.041 --> 18:22.750
-Hey, no take-backs!
-It can't be.

18:22.834 --> 18:25.542
McFizzles are turning
people into zombies?

18:29.208 --> 18:30.667
Oh, boy, all right, okay.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.625
Candy!

18:32.709 --> 18:35.542
(both shouting)

18:35.625 --> 18:37.542
Why are there two of them?

18:37.625 --> 18:39.166
(whimpering)

18:40.667 --> 18:41.834
Candy!

18:41.917 --> 18:43.041
(screaming)

18:48.417 --> 18:50.458
(all) Candy!

18:50.542 --> 18:52.709
Cunningham, if this really is the end,

18:52.792 --> 18:55.375
I want you to know that I know
you're totally terrified right now.

18:55.458 --> 18:57.750
-Come on, just admit it!
-Really? We're still doing that?

18:57.834 --> 19:00.166
-Just give me the mask.
-(all) Candy!

19:05.500 --> 19:06.875
Stick close, Howard.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.291
You got it, Ninja.

19:08.834 --> 19:11.083
Howard! You're eating McFizzles!

19:11.166 --> 19:14.208
Oh, man, I forgot! Maybe I'll be fine.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.166
I have a really strong stomach.

19:16.250 --> 19:18.792
Candy!

19:18.875 --> 19:20.625
(all) Candy!

19:20.709 --> 19:22.959
(all) Candy!

19:23.041 --> 19:24.792
Ninja Trippin' Balls!

19:26.959 --> 19:28.250
(grunting)

19:28.333 --> 19:29.250
Ninja Flip!

19:30.166 --> 19:32.208
Ninja Stalling Wedge!

19:32.291 --> 19:33.542
-(all growling)
-That'll hold 'em.

19:33.625 --> 19:36.041
Not gonna hold 'em. Come on.

19:36.125 --> 19:39.166
Candy. I hear you. You're zombies.

19:39.959 --> 19:43.625
Okay, Viceroy, we're in position.
Activate the Doomsday Device!

19:43.709 --> 19:45.250
(tone sounding)

19:45.333 --> 19:50.750
(machine) <i>1-18, 1-17, 1-16, 1-15...</i>

19:50.834 --> 19:52.709
Mmm, feels like I forgot something.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.959
Let me see, toothpaste,
toothbrush, deodorant.

19:55.041 --> 19:57.250
Uh, we got a countdown going on here.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.583
I was in such a rush.
Marci usually packs for me.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.542
(shouts) Forgot Marci!

20:01.625 --> 20:03.500
Turn it off! We gotta go back!

20:03.583 --> 20:05.792
(machine) <i>...55, 54...</i>

20:08.750 --> 20:11.875
Zombie Block, Zombie Block, Zombie Block!

20:12.542 --> 20:15.583
(grunting) No! Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

20:16.250 --> 20:18.917
Howard, what have you done to you?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.875
Candy!

20:20.959 --> 20:22.500
(shouting)

20:22.583 --> 20:24.500
-Candy!
-Ninja Scarf!

20:26.166 --> 20:28.792
Okay, just gotta stop a zombie plague.

20:28.875 --> 20:30.667
One question: How?

20:30.750 --> 20:32.542
(all) Candy!

20:32.625 --> 20:33.875
(all growling)

20:33.959 --> 20:35.792
They ate the candy
and turned into zombies,

20:35.875 --> 20:39.291
so to change them back,
they have to un-eat the candy.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.417
How do you uneat candy?

20:41.500 --> 20:44.709
(vomiting sounds)

20:44.792 --> 20:46.000
Aw, that's the worst.

20:50.166 --> 20:53.333
Here goes nothing. Ninja Pukin' Poke!

20:54.166 --> 20:55.375
(heaving)

20:55.458 --> 20:58.417
(vomiting)

21:04.041 --> 21:06.417
That's it, buddy. Let it out.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.250
Get it all out.

21:15.917 --> 21:17.667
Aw, schnasty!

21:23.917 --> 21:26.667
This is a revoltingly
positive turn of events.

21:27.750 --> 21:31.959
A simultaneous cookie-tossing
is returning the town to normal.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.250
Great. Now we've got
a live Doomsday Device,

21:34.333 --> 21:36.083
and nothing to obliterate!

21:36.166 --> 21:37.625
I know something we could blow up.

21:43.041 --> 21:44.959
(chokes, burps)

21:45.750 --> 21:46.875
Zombie burp.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.417
Howard, that we're on the flip side

21:49.500 --> 21:53.583
of a zombiepocalyse, I should tell you
I was scared on that ride.

21:53.667 --> 21:57.125
I just didn't want to, you know...
In front of the, you know.

21:57.208 --> 21:58.458
Aw, don't worry.

21:58.542 --> 22:00.834
I'll admit it for you.
Well, hello, ladies.

22:00.917 --> 22:02.917
-Funny story.
-(all gasping)

22:03.000 --> 22:04.709
It's raining McFizzles.

22:04.792 --> 22:07.583
You don't think anybody'd be
stupid enough to eat them now.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.583
-Right?
-(munching)

22:09.667 --> 22:12.000
Aw, Howard! Seriously!

22:12.083 --> 22:14.208
Oh, I'm supposed to say no to free Mc...

22:14.291 --> 22:16.458
Candy!

22:16.542 --> 22:18.083
(shouting)

22:18.667 --> 22:21.667
(theme music playing)
