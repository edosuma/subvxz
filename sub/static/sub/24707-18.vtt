00:32.256 --> 00:34.190
- Almost caught the guy?
- Yeah?

00:34.258 --> 00:38.592
Just got back from chasing him. Witness
saw him acting suspicious and called it in.

00:38.662 --> 00:43.099
Guy took off as soon as we got here.
Jumped on the F.D.R. Drive and we lost him.

00:43.167 --> 00:45.829
- We didn't even know there was a D.O.A. Here till we got back.
- We got the license number.

00:45.903 --> 00:48.337
- Get a look at the perp?
- Yeah, white, mid-30s.

00:48.406 --> 00:50.340
About six foot. A big Fu Manchu.
Come here.

00:50.408 --> 00:52.774
- Black hair, like, hanging down to the collar.
- This is a witness.

00:52.843 --> 00:55.437
- Saw it through his window.
- Can you describe the guy who got away with the car?

00:55.513 --> 00:57.606
Uh, yeah, white guy.
Looked about 35, 36...

00:57.681 --> 01:00.115
with a big drooping mustache.

01:00.184 --> 01:02.277
- Fu Manchu.
- Like that I guess, sure.

01:02.353 --> 01:04.878
And he had kind of long hair.
Dark hair. I live upstairs.

01:04.955 --> 01:08.118
I was looking out. I saw him dump
the other guy out of the car.

01:08.192 --> 01:10.319
- Shannon, you know, you should run the plates.
- All right.

01:10.394 --> 01:13.158
- You got it?
- You been drinking this morning?

01:13.230 --> 01:15.357
It's my life.
Do you mind?

01:15.433 --> 01:18.061
I work nights. I play bass.
I was drinking to try to get to sleep.

01:18.135 --> 01:20.729
- All right, gimme your name.
- Ken Thornton.

01:20.805 --> 01:24.741
- Musician, huh?
- Yeah. I play with Jaundice.

01:24.809 --> 01:28.540
- You play with Jaundice.
- You wouldn't have heard of it.

01:28.612 --> 01:30.773
So what do you do for a livin'?

01:30.848 --> 01:32.782
I'm a bike messenger
in the afternoon.

01:32.850 --> 01:35.876
Yeah.
Come over here, will ya?

01:35.953 --> 01:39.821
Bike messenger, huh?
You guys think Manhattan's a racetrack.

01:39.890 --> 01:43.257
I don't want any trouble.
I got enough troubles of my own.

01:43.327 --> 01:46.194
How come I don't have a problem believing that?
Come on.

01:46.263 --> 01:50.029
I got- Here. Here.
You ever seen this guy before?

01:50.100 --> 01:52.091
Uh, no, no, never seen him.

01:52.169 --> 01:55.161
Pretty old.
He's shot in the head.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.601
Dominic Landucci. 1924.

01:58.676 --> 02:02.578
What is that, 72 years old?
And $43.

02:02.646 --> 02:05.547
Landucci. There's some O.C. People
named Landucci.

02:05.616 --> 02:08.914
- Think he might be one?
- He's got a slug in the brain. Could have been a mob hit.

02:08.985 --> 02:11.113
Oh, a mob hit. Oh, no way, man.
No way, man.

02:11.188 --> 02:13.383
- I don't want nothing to do with this.
- Just relax.

02:13.457 --> 02:15.948
- Why the hell did I go and report it?
- He's got no keys on him here.

02:16.026 --> 02:19.689
I ran the plate. The car the perp fled in
is registered to Dominic Landucci.

02:19.763 --> 02:23.426
- That's this guy.
- It's this guy's car? Probably a carjacking, huh?

02:23.501 --> 02:26.436
- Hey, I'm not testifying.
- Stop worrying about it, huh?

02:26.504 --> 02:28.495
- Why don't you go get some sleep?
- That oughta be easy.

02:28.572 --> 02:32.467
- Do your best.
- Take it around the other side.

03:43.938 --> 03:45.872
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:48.743 --> 03:51.610
Diane, uh, could we talk a minute?

03:51.679 --> 03:53.943
Sure, Donna.

03:56.651 --> 04:01.418
Uh, a friend of mine's asking for advice
in a situation I'm not equipped to deal with.

04:01.489 --> 04:03.923
Should he or she be talking
to a detective?

04:03.992 --> 04:08.053
Absolutely. Her name is Marina Bermudez.
She's my hairdresser.

04:08.129 --> 04:11.394
- Uh-huh. - And, uh, Marina was
involved with this guy, Ronnie...

04:11.466 --> 04:13.934
who's been away in prison
for four and a half years.

04:14.002 --> 04:17.096
And he just got out.
And he's been coming around seeing her.

04:17.172 --> 04:20.608
His name is Pinera, in case
you wanna run him through B.C.I.

04:20.675 --> 04:23.644
- Ronnie Pinera? What was he in prison for?
- Mm-hmm.

04:23.711 --> 04:26.509
- Manslaughter, I believe.
- Okay.

04:26.581 --> 04:30.210
So, Marina's got this present boyfriend,
Luis, who's a truck driver.

04:30.285 --> 04:32.913
And sometimes Luis parks a loaded truck
at Marina's place.

04:32.987 --> 04:36.616
So, Ronnie, the ex-con,
heard about that...

04:36.691 --> 04:39.216
from a cousin of Marina's
who's jealous of her...

04:39.294 --> 04:41.592
because she's always
had a crush on Ronnie.

04:41.663 --> 04:46.123
This cousin told Ronnie about Luis,
and now Ronnie wants to hijack Luis's truck...

04:46.201 --> 04:48.260
when it's parked at Marina's place.

04:48.336 --> 04:50.736
He wants her to notify him
when Luis is there.

04:50.805 --> 04:55.640
Ronnie wants Marina to call him
when Luis is there with his truck.

04:55.710 --> 05:00.477
Exactly. So, Marina's deathly afraid
that if she doesn't notify Ronnie...

05:00.548 --> 05:04.006
that the blabbermouth cousin
down the street's liable to see Luis's truck...

05:04.085 --> 05:06.679
and tell Ronnie
about it afterwards.

05:06.754 --> 05:09.518
And then Ronnie might blow his stack
and really hurt her or something.

05:09.591 --> 05:12.424
Is Ronnie on parole,
or did he serve his full sentence?

05:12.493 --> 05:15.121
I don't know.

05:15.196 --> 05:18.097
Well, Donna, see,
he hasn't really committed a crime yet.

05:18.166 --> 05:20.157
He might be violating his parole.

05:20.235 --> 05:24.467
L- I can find out his status
through B.C.I.

05:24.539 --> 05:26.973
Have your friend Marina
come in and talk to me.

05:27.041 --> 05:29.297
I would be so grateful,
because I feel beyond my depth.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.694
No, you ran the story pretty good.

05:31.766 --> 05:33.996
- I'll give her a call.
- All right.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.565
- I think he had a bigger nose.
- Did you change the mustache?

05:41.643 --> 05:44.703
- I thought you had the mustache too small.
- Marini, you had your say.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.906
Shannon don't need your kibitz in here.

05:46.981 --> 05:49.609
It was a big Fu Manchu.

05:49.684 --> 05:51.618
Bobby. Andy.

06:00.929 --> 06:02.954
This is Mike Francis, F.B.I.

06:03.031 --> 06:06.694
- Bobby Simone. Andy Sipowicz.
- Bobby. Andy.

06:06.768 --> 06:09.430
I'm hoping we can scratch each other's backs
in the Dominic Landucci murder.

06:09.504 --> 06:11.438
Is that right?

06:11.506 --> 06:15.306
We're running a surveillance
on the Palermo Social Club. It's on Mulberry.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.971
- You know, it's a mob hangout.
- There's rumor to that effect.

06:19.047 --> 06:22.141
We videotape everyone coming
in and out of that club during business hours.

06:22.216 --> 06:25.083
Well, this morning, some of
the wiseguys showing up...

06:25.153 --> 06:27.280
were acting kind of
different than usual.

06:27.355 --> 06:29.323
A lot of laughing.
Giving each other the high fives.

06:29.390 --> 06:32.917
We heard about the Landucci hit,
we put it together.

06:32.994 --> 06:34.928
Landucci went to the Palermo Club
every day of the week.

06:34.996 --> 06:39.092
- Case closed.
- We ran this Landucci through B.C.I.

06:39.167 --> 06:41.965
He's got a couple of low-rank collars
for shylocking.

06:42.036 --> 06:44.402
You think he's big enough
to rate a hit and all these high fives?

06:44.472 --> 06:46.838
I know how to find out.

06:46.908 --> 06:50.742
Agent Francis feels our job could get
a court order to plant a listening device.

06:50.812 --> 06:55.112
You got cause to believe a contract
on Landucci might have been run out of that club.

06:55.183 --> 06:59.677
We provide the equipment, run the bug
into your squad, share the information.

06:59.754 --> 07:02.917
Inspector Aiello
thinks it's a good idea.

07:02.991 --> 07:06.222
There's a disconnected phone socket
in the card room we can use to put the place up.

07:06.294 --> 07:09.320
You get your court order today,
we can get you in tonight.

07:09.397 --> 07:13.128
- You're gonna get us in?
- Our bug, my plan, your tap.

07:13.201 --> 07:16.432
Set him up in Anticrime.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.564
Got my equipment outside.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.303
He's got his equipment outside.

07:32.854 --> 07:36.654
- Come on. Let's go, Francis.
- Hey, Bob, I can't get the son of a bitch in.

07:36.724 --> 07:41.218
Are you talkin' to me, huh?
Because I'm Andy and that's Bob.

07:41.295 --> 07:43.320
- Hmm?
- What was that? Did you hear something?

07:43.398 --> 07:46.333
No, I didn't hear- Move over, huh?
Let me put this damn thing in here.

07:46.401 --> 07:49.893
- Wejust need some more light.
- Go on, move, move.

07:49.971 --> 07:52.531
- I gotta take a leak.
- Need any help with that too?

07:52.607 --> 07:55.041
Don't laugh.
You ever have prostatitis?

07:55.109 --> 07:57.009
Go ahead, Francis.
Do what you gotta do.

07:57.078 --> 07:59.137
Feels like you gotta piss all the time.
Stand there, get no flow.

07:59.213 --> 08:02.444
Look, I had prostrate" trouble once.
I don't got it no more.

08:02.517 --> 08:05.645
But if you don't get the hell outta here,
I'm gonna piss on your shoes. Beat it.

08:05.720 --> 08:09.053
He's gonna tell me how to...

08:09.123 --> 08:13.059
Prostrate.
I got a prostrate. Bull.

08:13.127 --> 08:15.061
At least he's an expert, you know?

08:15.129 --> 08:18.758
Yeah, you don't know.
I'm the king of prostrates. Okay. Got it.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.858
Shh. Hey.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.266
- What?
- I heard something.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.497
- Don't you start with me.
- I'm serious. Turn off your light.

08:27.508 --> 08:31.342
Keep quiet. I don't want pain-in-the-ass Giordano
coming down from upstairs.

08:31.412 --> 08:33.676
Hey, Giordano's passed out.
Don't worry.

08:33.748 --> 08:36.683
Yeah, I don't want that drunken Giordano
figuring out that I got the missing key.

08:36.751 --> 08:40.278
Just keep your voice down.

08:40.354 --> 08:43.551
- Shh.
- Put your money where your mouth is.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.956
- And watch me run the table.
- Yeah, right.

08:46.027 --> 08:49.224
You're so full of crap. I could beat you
with both hands tied behind my back.

08:49.297 --> 08:53.131
You racked up the cue ball,
you big asshole.

08:53.201 --> 08:55.669
I love you, you crazy bastard. You know why?

08:55.736 --> 08:57.863
- Uh-uh. - 'Cause you don't know
your ass from a hole in the ground.

08:57.939 --> 08:59.873
You're gonna show me
pool shootin'?

08:59.941 --> 09:02.876
What the hell is that?

09:02.944 --> 09:05.208
- Somebody's in the toilet.
- Somebody's in here?

09:05.279 --> 09:10.808
If these guys find out we're cops,
they're gonna level this place looking for the bug.

09:10.885 --> 09:13.285
- Who the hell are you?
- Oh, my God.

09:13.354 --> 09:15.288
All right, get 'em up, you sons of bitches.
This is a stickup.

09:15.356 --> 09:18.587
Yeah, yeah, put those pool cues down.
Come on, come on, come on.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.389
Put those cues on the table!
Get your hands on the table!

09:21.462 --> 09:23.589
- All right.
- And take off those watches!

09:23.664 --> 09:26.565
You better hurry up.
Gimme that watch. Gimme that watch!

09:26.634 --> 09:30.001
- Get on the floor. Come on, asshole.
- Get down there!

09:30.071 --> 09:33.097
And get his wallet. Shut up!

09:33.174 --> 09:35.768
Hey, you wanna shoot him? Go ahead, shoot him.
You wanna shoot him.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.902
- I think I'm gonna shoot him.
- No, no, no!

09:37.979 --> 09:41.437
- Don't shoot me, man, please!
- Come on!

09:41.516 --> 09:44.007
- Start praying!
- What the hell you doing?

09:44.085 --> 09:46.747
- We're robbin' the place. That's what we came here for.
- You can't do this.

09:46.821 --> 09:48.755
Will you shut up and find something
to tie them up with?

09:48.823 --> 09:50.814
- This is horrible.
- Move!

09:50.892 --> 09:54.419
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- These guys are insane. Why didn't somebody warn me?

09:54.495 --> 09:56.520
Quit your bitchin'
andjust find us somethin'.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.760
- This is the last time you go on a job with us.
- Damn right!

10:02.570 --> 10:06.438
- Here. Here's some tape.
- Come on, hands behind your back.

10:06.507 --> 10:08.441
- Here, keep a gun on 'em.
- What?

10:08.509 --> 10:11.410
Keep the gun on 'em.

10:11.479 --> 10:13.538
Don't move!

10:13.614 --> 10:15.605
Hands behind your back.
Come on.

10:15.683 --> 10:18.652
Where you taking that?

10:18.719 --> 10:20.778
Out to the car.

10:23.925 --> 10:26.985
Oh, God.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.996
I see you got over
your flow problems there.

10:30.064 --> 10:32.123
- Oh.
- Hey, get the other TV.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.896
- Well, I-
- Come on. Put your feet together.

10:38.673 --> 10:40.607
Put your feet together.
Come on.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.477
- Did you get the stuff vouchered?
- Yeah.

10:55.957 --> 10:59.484
- So, anytime now, huh?
- Complete confidence. That's the key.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.791
- Sure.
- Circumstances, it was the only appropriate move.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.764
Yeah. Morning.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.892
- Morning. How'd it go last night?
- Hey.

11:07.969 --> 11:11.234
- Yeah, we got the bug in.
- Good.

11:11.305 --> 11:15.639
A couple of hiccups,
but nothing we couldn't take care of.

11:16.978 --> 11:21.005
- Couple of hiccups?
- Yeah, couple of hiccups.

11:21.082 --> 11:23.073
Let's hear about it.

11:31.492 --> 11:33.960
So, describe the hiccups.

11:34.028 --> 11:36.326
A couple of wiseguys
walked in on us.

11:36.397 --> 11:39.298
- And?
- We jumped 'em. It was the only appropriate thing.

11:39.367 --> 11:43.030
Absolutely. No choice. If we identified ourselves,
they would have known the place was up.

11:43.104 --> 11:46.369
- We had to protect the operation.
- What do you mean jumpin' em?

11:46.440 --> 11:49.034
- We jumped 'em, like we were burglars.
- And then you ran out?

11:49.110 --> 11:52.079
Oh, good. Here comes Dopey.

11:57.251 --> 11:59.481
I want you to know I was in the toilet
when they pulled that holdup.

11:59.553 --> 12:02.716
- What holdup?
- I just told you we jumped 'em.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.020
You jumped 'em
and you took something?

12:05.092 --> 12:06.889
Something? They cleaned the place out.

12:06.961 --> 12:08.826
- We had to make it look real.
- What'd you take?

12:08.896 --> 12:12.457
- Their wallets and watches.
- And two TV sets.

12:12.533 --> 12:15.331
- You stole the TVs?
- All that stuff is vouchered, boss...

12:15.403 --> 12:18.065
downstairs
in the property room.

12:18.139 --> 12:20.130
Well, we'll have to work out
a way to return that stuff.

12:20.207 --> 12:23.005
Can we add saving my job
to that wish list?

12:23.077 --> 12:25.568
Just tell your boss
you were in the potty.

12:25.646 --> 12:28.410
Do you know how many of those goombahs'
civil rights got violated last night?

12:28.482 --> 12:32.077
When we walked out of that social club,
those men had been robbed...

12:32.153 --> 12:35.748
threatened with death at gunpoint
and left hog-tied on the floor.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.882
Well, right now that sounds
like spilled milk.

12:37.958 --> 12:41.587
No, no, the milk
is just beginning to spill.

12:41.662 --> 12:45.063
The conversations that bug picks up
are gonna get me fired.

12:45.132 --> 12:48.192
What we did last night is gonna be
all anybody at Palermo is talking about...

12:48.269 --> 12:50.362
today or in
the foreseeable future.

12:50.438 --> 12:53.100
Do you got a plan, or are you
just gonna stand there cryin'?

12:56.210 --> 13:01.147
I've told my boss you don't want
bureau people trampling around your squad.

13:01.215 --> 13:04.446
When I'm not on the monitor,
you've insisted on your people relieving me.

13:04.518 --> 13:06.748
I got no problem with that.

13:06.821 --> 13:09.346
Good.
'Cause everyone in this room should understand...

13:09.423 --> 13:11.857
if I go, it won't be alone.

13:11.926 --> 13:15.726
What are you gonna tell your bosses
when they ask you about the transcripts?

13:15.796 --> 13:18.788
Tapes get lost. Portions get erased.
Accidents happen.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.857
Hey, look at last night.

13:20.935 --> 13:23.927
Don't ever mention last night to me again.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.802
- Yeah, Donna.
- The two of you should be in a zoo.

13:26.874 --> 13:30.241
Yeah, and you oughta be
a groundskeeper at a miniature golf course.

13:30.311 --> 13:33.280
Miniature golf course.
What does that mean?

13:33.347 --> 13:35.372
Just keep your hands on your po-po
and try to make wee-wee.

13:35.449 --> 13:40.318
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Detective Culbertson called from the 1 st.

13:40.388 --> 13:43.152
Says they've got a suspect in a bar holdup.
Fits the sketch...

13:43.224 --> 13:45.158
you guys circulated
on the Landucci perp.

13:45.226 --> 13:47.751
- Mr. Fu Manchu.
- Oh, my God.

13:47.828 --> 13:50.592
- What's the matter?
- Those are the guys we took off.

13:50.664 --> 13:54.122
They're liable to wanna talk to you.

13:58.472 --> 14:02.238
Hey, Donna, don't ask me to explain,
but for the next 20 seconds or so...

14:02.309 --> 14:05.142
don't let those guys
take their eyes off you.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.680
- Get outta here.
- All right, come on.

14:10.284 --> 14:13.913
- We were held up and robbed.
- Yeah, taped up all night laying on the floor.

14:13.988 --> 14:16.354
Lost a lot of money and possessions.

14:16.424 --> 14:20.520
Uh, Detective Medavoy?
Uh, these men have a robbery to report.

14:20.594 --> 14:24.928
- Oh. Come here.
- Yeah, we're reporting an armed robbery.

14:24.999 --> 14:28.332
- Yeah, robbed at gunpoint. Taped up all night long.
- Uh-huh.

14:29.904 --> 14:32.964
Oh, God.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.974
Hey!

14:35.042 --> 14:37.135
- Their backs are turned. It's okay.
- All right, good.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.270
We're gonna go to 1 st Precinct.
You wanna listen to your bug?

14:39.346 --> 14:42.713
This is a nightmare.

14:42.783 --> 14:47.186
Francis, can you make it
up the stairs okay?

14:47.254 --> 14:49.688
Go ahead, Francis,
while their backs are still turned.

14:49.757 --> 14:52.317
We're gonna go grab
our coats. Come on.

14:52.393 --> 14:54.327
Go.

14:55.563 --> 14:57.497
What a dick.

14:57.565 --> 15:02.468
Diane? Uh, this is Detective Russell.

15:02.536 --> 15:04.902
- Mark Margiotti. It's a pleasure.
- How do you do?

15:04.972 --> 15:09.204
A detective. I gotta say you're
the best-looking detective I've ever run into.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.712
No offense to you, but a fact is a fact.
Am I right?

15:12.780 --> 15:14.873
- You're right.
- Where did this robbery take place?

15:14.949 --> 15:19.079
We're in a private club, just me and Vince,
shooting a quiet game of pool.

15:19.153 --> 15:22.680
And these psychos bust in screamin'.
Stick a sawed-off shotgun to my head.

15:22.756 --> 15:26.419
They were outta their minds
on P.C.P. Or something.

15:26.494 --> 15:29.361
- What's the name of this club?
- The Palermo Social Club.

15:29.430 --> 15:31.728
These men, how many were there?

15:31.799 --> 15:33.733
- Four.
- Three.

15:33.801 --> 15:37.498
- So, which was it?
- Oh, she's sharp, you know?

15:38.906 --> 15:41.340
Four, counting the guy outside.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.342
So, what do we got?

15:43.410 --> 15:45.878
- Robbery at the Palermo Social Club.
- No, a stickup.

15:45.946 --> 15:49.177
They ripped off four TVs,
plus all our money and our watches.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.013
- Gold watches.
- Club have insurance?

15:51.085 --> 15:54.851
- Fortunately, yes.
- So, you know anything about this murder yesterday?

15:54.922 --> 15:57.891
- What murder? I didn't hear nothin'.
- Dominic Landucci.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.892
He belonged to a Palermo Club.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.555
You mean old man Dominic? Yeah, I heard
about that. Somebody whacked him.

16:03.631 --> 16:06.122
Yeah, you got any idea how that happened?

16:06.200 --> 16:09.829
Not a clue.
Couldn't even guess.

16:09.904 --> 16:14.204
So, uh, how big was Landucci?
Big enough to be in somebody's way?

16:14.275 --> 16:17.608
- No one that I know about.
- Did he have any enemies?

16:17.678 --> 16:21.136
Everybody liked him.
He was just an old mustached Pete.

16:21.215 --> 16:23.206
Sat around all day
reading the paper.

16:23.284 --> 16:26.651
Okay. I'll let you
get on with your interview.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.985
All right, cash stolen. How much money
did you have in your wallet?

16:30.057 --> 16:33.584
- Two grand.
- Really? You carry that much cash?

16:33.661 --> 16:36.255
- Absolutely.
- How about you?

16:36.330 --> 16:39.128
- Several thousand also.
- You too?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.133
Oh, yes.

16:44.138 --> 16:48.131
He robbed the bar about 2:00 this morning.
We grabbed him half a block away.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.836
- You recover the gun?
- Had it on him. A.38.

16:50.911 --> 16:52.879
- What your D.O.A. Get whacked with?
- Same caliber.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.574
Okay, this is
Parnell Manning.

16:56.650 --> 16:58.777
He's got four arrests.
Three of'em for robbery.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.616
And there's probably 100 other stickups
we don't know about.

17:01.689 --> 17:04.214
- Right, Parnell?
- Is that supposed to be a joke?

17:04.290 --> 17:07.954
- Some detectives to see you.
- We're from the 15th Squad. How you doing?

17:08.028 --> 17:10.997
I wanna know where you were
yesterday around 900 in the morning.

17:11.065 --> 17:13.032
In bed, sleepin'.

17:13.099 --> 17:16.262
- Anybody there with you can vouch for that?
- I live at the Eagle Hotel.

17:16.337 --> 17:19.271
First Avenue.
Desk clerk saw me go out. He knows me.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.865
- I've been there about six months.
- How you pay for the rent?

17:21.942 --> 17:23.807
- I work.
- At what?

17:23.877 --> 17:25.810
- Oddjobs.
- I bet they're odd.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.848
Talk to the desk clerk, okay?
He'll back up what I'm sayin'.

17:28.916 --> 17:31.043
You know anybody associated
with the Palermo Social Club?

17:31.118 --> 17:33.882
- Never heard of it.
- You know Dominic Landucci?

17:33.954 --> 17:38.118
Oh, let me guess.
He got his 7-Eleven knocked over...

17:38.192 --> 17:40.524
in Pissant, Georgia,
so naturally I did it, right?

17:40.594 --> 17:43.722
Landucci got murdered yesterday
by a guy that fits your description to a T."

17:43.797 --> 17:45.856
White guy, mustache?

17:45.933 --> 17:48.663
Some cop goes,
Yeah, we got him right here in a cell."

17:48.736 --> 17:51.034
Sit up straight.

17:53.273 --> 17:57.471
- I'm gonna show this to the clerk at your hotel.
- I hope that creep can remember.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.842
'Cause I didn't kill nobody,
and that's the truth.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.677
Well, we'd like to believe you, Parnell,
but you don't have the kind of background...

18:02.750 --> 18:06.345
- that inspires trust.
- Officer, we're done here.

18:06.420 --> 18:10.789
Hey, I know I'm gonna do time
on the bar stickup...

18:10.858 --> 18:13.224
but believe me,
I'm not your guy in the killing.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.227
And if you were, you'd tell us.

18:27.608 --> 18:30.634
- Hey, your boy's here.
- Yeah, we were gonna grab a sandwich.

18:30.711 --> 18:33.111
- I'll be right with you, Son.
- Oh, take your time, Pop.

18:33.180 --> 18:36.172
How'd it go with those guys
from the social club?

18:36.250 --> 18:38.616
- How many TVs did you take?
- Two.

18:38.686 --> 18:40.984
- They're claiming four.
- Sure, the stuff's insured.

18:41.055 --> 18:43.080
So, how'd it work out
with that stickup guy at the 1 st?

18:43.157 --> 18:45.352
He fits the description, Lieu,
but his alibi's good.

18:45.426 --> 18:47.894
The hotel clerk says
that this guy was up in his room...

18:47.961 --> 18:49.895
at the time that Landucci's body
was getting dumped.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.864
Yeah, they found Landucci's car
abandoned uptown.

18:52.933 --> 18:56.528
- I'll look at it, Andy. Go have lunch.
- All right, thanks.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.537
- AndyJ. Have a good lunch.
- Hey.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.869
- I'll see ya.
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

19:00.941 --> 19:03.136
- What's going on?
- Ah, working a homicide.

19:03.210 --> 19:06.179
Plus some wiseguys
are pumping up an insurance claim.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.874
These assholes can't even
be honest about getting robbed.

19:14.822 --> 19:16.756
- Here I am.
- Hi, Marina.

19:16.824 --> 19:19.156
- I'm nervous.
- I know, but you're doing the right thing.

19:19.226 --> 19:22.286
Come on.
We'll talk to Detective Russell.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.388
Yeah, I got it.
See you later.

19:25.466 --> 19:29.994
Detective Russell, this is Marina Bermudez,
my friend from the hairdresser's.

19:30.070 --> 19:32.300
Hi, Marina.
I'm glad you came in.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.966
Donna said she told you
about my situation?

19:35.042 --> 19:38.842
Yeah, your ex-boyfriend wants to hijack
your present boyfriend's truck.

19:38.912 --> 19:41.574
Yeah. It's on my mind a lot.
It's really worrying me.

19:41.648 --> 19:44.811
Ronnie said Luis wouldn't get hurt,
but you just never know.

19:44.885 --> 19:46.819
Have you warned Luis?

19:46.887 --> 19:49.151
I'm afraid to cross Ronnie.
That man can hurt you.

19:49.223 --> 19:51.817
- Did Ronnie tell you what his plan is?
- It'd be him...

19:51.892 --> 19:55.123
and this other guy he runs with
would grab Luis's truck outside my place.

19:55.195 --> 19:59.131
They'd grab his keys
when he comes out from seeing me.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.133
Luis always stops
on his way out of town.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.226
Gets kinda lonesome on the road.

20:03.303 --> 20:06.596
He's one of these guys,
you know, who needs a woman.

20:06.665 --> 20:11.125
- He's going out later on today.
- He's got a load of shrimp and lobster for Chicago.

20:11.203 --> 20:14.070
I didn't tell Ronnie.
I'm afraid my creep Cousin Laurie...

20:14.139 --> 20:16.733
will be watching my place,
and she'll tell him.

20:16.808 --> 20:19.868
And then he's gonna beat the crap out of me
for not letting him know.

20:19.945 --> 20:22.914
Well, I think we can help you with this, Marina,
but you need to cooperate a little.

20:22.981 --> 20:25.882
I looked Ronnie up,
and he did his full bit in prison...

20:25.951 --> 20:28.579
so we can't get him
on a parole violation.

20:28.654 --> 20:30.952
That means we need
an overt act to arrest him.

20:31.023 --> 20:34.891
- What's an overt act?
- Does Ronnie know what Luis looks like?

20:34.960 --> 20:37.793
Not really.
I think he saw him once at a christening.

20:37.863 --> 20:40.559
Do you have a picture of Luis?

20:44.970 --> 20:46.904
Wait here
while I talk to my boss.

20:49.741 --> 20:52.539
- What's going on?
- I think they're gonna run in a ringer for Luis.

20:52.611 --> 20:55.546
If it's James Martinez,
he's really cute.

21:02.754 --> 21:06.019
I'll tell ya, Hackensack
or no Hackensack, Andy...

21:06.091 --> 21:09.788
you park that piece of junk on the street,
the department of sanitation's gonna tow it.

21:09.861 --> 21:12.853
The engine on the Caddie blew!
Excuse me.

21:12.931 --> 21:15.923
Don't you never let Mr. Gucci hear
you say that, Andy. You'll break his heart.

21:16.001 --> 21:18.595
I had 700 bucks.
This was all I could get.

21:18.670 --> 21:21.161
Mm-hmm. As soon as you get
a couple paychecks in the bank...

21:21.239 --> 21:23.867
you're gonna do better for yourself.

21:23.942 --> 21:26.672
- It got me cross-country.
- Yeah.

21:33.251 --> 21:35.185
Okay.

21:37.856 --> 21:41.485
You're eating your sandwich.
You got company. The weather's fine.

21:41.560 --> 21:45.690
- This is a perfect time to tune out the job.
- Yeah.

21:45.764 --> 21:49.791
But you don't wanna tune it out,
'cause there's too much you gotta learn.

21:53.305 --> 21:57.435
Here's the story
about being a uniform cop.

21:57.509 --> 22:01.878
Years ago, it's midnight, me and my partner
are a couple of blocks from the precinct...

22:01.947 --> 22:05.542
when I see two big Cadillacs
turn into an alley.

22:05.617 --> 22:08.711
Two Cadillacs?
I'm thinking maybe they're mob guys.

22:08.787 --> 22:12.314
So, we get out, we go in the alley,
see what's going on.

22:12.391 --> 22:15.554
Well, the Cadillacs are gone,
but I keep on walking...

22:15.627 --> 22:19.586
and pretty soon I see two guys
come out of a back door.

22:19.664 --> 22:21.598
One of them has got
a machine gun.

22:21.666 --> 22:26.865
So I yell to my partner, Hey, got a guy
back here with a machine gun."

22:26.938 --> 22:30.874
I didn't know he could move so fast.
He runs behind the telephone pole.

22:30.942 --> 22:34.400
And I'm standing in the doorway with my gun
pointing at the guy with the machine gun.

22:36.415 --> 22:38.406
What's going on with that?

22:39.885 --> 22:44.151
The building was a toy factory
that made toy machine guns...

22:44.222 --> 22:47.885
and one of the guys
was taking one home to his kid.

22:47.959 --> 22:49.893
I don't think he knew how close
I come to shooting him.

22:49.961 --> 22:52.054
But you didn't.

22:52.130 --> 22:57.295
I could have. And it would have been off
not being prepared. This was my beat.

22:57.369 --> 23:00.805
And I should have known about the toy factory
and what kind of toys they made.

23:00.872 --> 23:03.807
And knowing that, I should have figured,
you know, it's midnight.

23:03.875 --> 23:06.935
The graveyard shift's
just getting off.

23:07.012 --> 23:09.242
I didn't put it all together.

23:09.314 --> 23:12.477
So, I came this close
to shooting that man.

23:14.052 --> 23:17.283
People, places,
the things they do...

23:17.355 --> 23:19.653
the times they do 'em- say that.

23:19.724 --> 23:23.785
People, places, the things they do,
the times they do 'em.

23:23.862 --> 23:29.391
A beat cop knows those four things,
he's ready to do his job.

23:35.340 --> 23:37.672
You're gonna be okay.

23:46.918 --> 23:51.378
Yeah, that's 555-0172.

23:51.456 --> 23:54.653
Right, 212. I will hold.

23:54.726 --> 23:58.093
- Anything on the D.O.A.'s car?
- Landucci. He definitely got whacked in it.

23:58.163 --> 24:00.427
It's full of blood.
The crime scene is still processing.

24:00.499 --> 24:02.490
- Who you got?
- I'm running a check on a phone number...

24:02.567 --> 24:05.400
that was found written on a newspaper
in the front seat of Landucci's car.

24:05.470 --> 24:08.837
Shannon and this other cop
both picked this Parnell on photo arrays.

24:08.907 --> 24:11.671
But I'm not buying.
The guy's alibied up, plus he's a crook.

24:11.743 --> 24:14.007
D.O.A.'s money's still in his wallet.

24:14.079 --> 24:15.944
Yeah. Uh-huh, you got it?

24:16.014 --> 24:18.448
Good.

24:18.517 --> 24:21.213
Herman with an 'H"?

24:21.286 --> 24:24.016
Yeah, all right.
Thanks, man.

24:24.089 --> 24:26.887
That number
on Landucci's newspaper.

24:26.958 --> 24:30.223
It's for a guy named Greg Herman.
He lives over on Mott Street.

24:30.295 --> 24:34.356
- We gonna pick him up?
- Yeah. Hey, Lieu.

24:34.432 --> 24:38.459
We might have something on that homicide.
You need us on this shrimp truck thing?

24:38.537 --> 24:41.597
- No, we're good.
- You don't trust us. No more street operations, huh?

24:50.181 --> 24:53.048
- Hey, how's it going there, Francis?
- Need stronger coffee.

24:53.118 --> 24:55.052
What are you getting on the bug?

24:55.120 --> 24:58.749
Between comparing the size of their johnsons?
There's more stuff about our adventure.

24:58.823 --> 25:01.087
How they're gonna keep Iying
about their losses.

25:01.159 --> 25:04.151
- That's why they call 'em crooks.
- Plus they're talking about...

25:04.229 --> 25:09.030
how Angelo Raffini got pulled out of the river
this morning in Hoboken with two in the head.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.034
You guys are probably right.

25:11.102 --> 25:13.935
Those high fives outside the club yesterday,
probably about Raffini.

25:14.005 --> 25:16.132
So our shylock Landucci's
not the godfather.

25:16.207 --> 25:18.675
Doesn't look like it, no.

25:18.743 --> 25:21.337
Uh, you got any leads?

25:21.413 --> 25:23.278
- We're working on a few things.
- You know, Francis...

25:23.348 --> 25:25.282
you look like you could use
some relief there.

25:25.350 --> 25:27.750
Nobody goes in
that listening room but me.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.413
All right, yeah,
but maybe you could listen Iying down.

25:30.488 --> 25:32.649
You don't wanna win the battle
and lose the war.

25:44.569 --> 25:46.537
So I park my truck.
I come to your door.

25:46.605 --> 25:49.768
- Would you come down personally when I ring, or buzz me up?
- I buzz you up.

25:49.841 --> 25:53.277
- So you buzz me up.
- Yeah, and I've already called Ronnie.

25:53.345 --> 25:55.643
Right. You let him know
that I'm comin'.

25:55.714 --> 25:58.706
And now I'm in there
with you for, like, a half an hour.

25:58.783 --> 26:02.480
- And if Ronnie calls back, I confirm you're there.
- And that's your part.

26:02.554 --> 26:05.887
And I leave the apartment. I go outside,
and everyone does theirjob.

26:05.957 --> 26:09.051
- You tried out the truck?
- I took it around the block. It's no problem.

26:09.127 --> 26:11.527
You up for this?

26:11.596 --> 26:14.064
These police officers
are going to be waiting in the van?

26:14.132 --> 26:19.297
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah, I guess I'm up for it.

26:19.371 --> 26:22.135
It'll go fine, Marina.

26:24.643 --> 26:27.976
Okay? Let's go.

26:38.923 --> 26:41.585
How long is he gonna
stay in there with her?

26:41.660 --> 26:44.993
James is supposed to
make it look good, Adrianne.

26:45.063 --> 26:47.497
- He's supposed to be getting one for the road.
- That's sick.

26:47.565 --> 26:50.193
- What's sick?
- Your adolescent snickering.

26:50.268 --> 26:53.533
- I wasn't snickering. I was stating a fact.
- Why don't you grow up, Greg?

26:53.605 --> 26:56.506
- I was not snickering.
- No wonder Donna couldn't take you anymore.

26:56.574 --> 26:58.838
Whoa, Adrianne,
that's a low blow.

26:58.910 --> 27:01.743
Here he comes.
He's coming out.

27:15.126 --> 27:16.787
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

27:16.861 --> 27:20.024
- You wanna die for a load of shrimp?
- No, man. Hell, no.

27:20.098 --> 27:21.759
All right, get out.
Don't do nothin'stupid.

27:21.833 --> 27:24.563
- Take it, it's yours. All right?
- Hold it! Police!

27:24.636 --> 27:28.094
- Get your hands up! Get 'em up!
- Hands on your head! Drop it! Drop it!

27:28.173 --> 27:30.437
Get down!
Get down there!

27:30.508 --> 27:32.772
Down on your face. Down!

27:35.113 --> 27:37.581
- Where's James?
- He's over there.

27:37.649 --> 27:40.584
Where'd you think he was, Adrianne?
Out getting some quick seconds?

27:42.087 --> 27:44.988
- How we doing?
- Easy. Easy.

27:54.499 --> 27:57.093
Sit down, Greg.

27:57.168 --> 27:59.932
- You gonna tell me what this is about?
- You answering a few questions.

28:00.004 --> 28:03.098
- What were you doing today?
- Well, one thing and another.

28:03.174 --> 28:07.838
I'm looking for work.
I read the papers. I go out. Why?

28:07.912 --> 28:09.903
Where were you yesterday morning
at 830 to 900 a. M?

28:09.981 --> 28:12.176
- At home.
- Anybody with ya?

28:12.250 --> 28:14.844
- No.
- You're outta work, huh?

28:14.919 --> 28:18.320
You borrow money?

28:18.389 --> 28:20.323
- A little.
- Who from?

28:20.391 --> 28:24.691
- Friends.
- Anybody else?

28:26.064 --> 28:28.123
Borrow anything
from a Dominic Landucci?

28:32.971 --> 28:35.030
Well, I did, yeah.

28:35.106 --> 28:37.506
- You see him yesterday?
- No.

28:37.575 --> 28:39.941
- No, you didn't see him. Is that what you're saying?
- No, I didn't.

28:40.011 --> 28:44.038
How come your phone number's
on his newspaper from yesterday?

28:44.115 --> 28:46.049
Well, I was supposed
to see him yesterday.

28:46.117 --> 28:48.881
I was supposed to pay him some money
that I owed him, but he never showed.

28:48.953 --> 28:50.818
- How much money do you owe him?
- I was gonna pay him 150.

28:50.889 --> 28:52.857
- Is that what you owe him, or is that the vig?
- That's the vig.

28:52.924 --> 28:54.983
- So you pay him that every week?
- Yeah.

28:55.059 --> 28:57.254
If you're not working,
where do you get the money to pay?

28:57.328 --> 29:00.354
- Savings account.
- You got money in the bank, but you borrow from a shy?

29:00.431 --> 29:02.922
What bank do you have your account at, Greg?

29:03.001 --> 29:05.367
Uh, Chemical Bank on 23rd.

29:05.436 --> 29:08.234
And when did you make your withdrawal
to pay Landucci?

29:08.306 --> 29:11.673
- Eh, a couple nights ago.
- You ever been late on your vig payments before?

29:11.743 --> 29:14.678
One or two.
I make 'em mostly.

29:14.746 --> 29:18.204
From the savings that you didn't touch when
you went to this juice guy to start with, right?

29:18.283 --> 29:21.343
I sold my car
after I borrowed the money.

29:21.419 --> 29:23.649
That's where I got the money
to put in the bank.

29:23.721 --> 29:26.383
What happened to your face?
You got these bruises over there.

29:26.457 --> 29:29.722
- I got in a car wreck.
- I thought you said you sold your car.

29:29.794 --> 29:32.524
- No, I was riding in my friend's car.
- What's his name?

29:32.597 --> 29:35.157
- HankJablonski.
- Is that with a J,"Jablonski?

29:35.233 --> 29:38.202
Yeah.

29:38.269 --> 29:40.999
Well, Dominic Landucci,
he was murdered yesterday, Greg.

29:43.241 --> 29:45.835
Oh, wow.

29:45.910 --> 29:47.741
- You guys know who done it?
- Nope.

29:47.812 --> 29:52.010
What we know is that your name
was written on a paper in his car.

29:53.751 --> 29:56.618
- You're gonna have to stay here for a little while.
- What for?

29:56.688 --> 29:59.248
What for, Greg?
We gotta check your story out.

30:05.330 --> 30:07.855
So what were you doing
when you were up in her apartment?

30:07.932 --> 30:10.594
- Nothing. Just talking.
- You must have had a lot to say to each other.

30:10.668 --> 30:13.865
- You gonna see her again?
- Adrianne, I got no plans on seeing her.

30:13.938 --> 30:15.872
- Why not? You asked her out.
- I didn't ask her out.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.704
- Why would you think that?
- So what are you getting so defensive about?

30:21.946 --> 30:23.709
Hello.

30:23.781 --> 30:26.773
- Hello.
- Here.

30:30.588 --> 30:35.218
Boss, this is Marina Bermudez.
We wanna take her statement.

30:35.293 --> 30:37.227
We saw her looking through the window
when this went down.

30:37.295 --> 30:39.820
- What are you looking at her for?
- She wasn't involved.

30:39.898 --> 30:41.991
- We just want a witness statement.
- Okay.

30:42.066 --> 30:45.263
- Take her statement and let her go.
- Right through here.

30:47.572 --> 30:50.803
- Do you think that worked?
- That guy had a gun to my head, Marina.

30:50.875 --> 30:54.402
- He's not getting bail anyways.
- I'm so grateful to you, James.

30:54.479 --> 30:56.811
You took a big chance
doing what you did.

30:56.881 --> 31:01.477
- Ah, I was just doing my job.
- So, uh, thanks again.

31:01.552 --> 31:03.315
- Sure.
- Thanks.

31:05.757 --> 31:09.124
- Talk to you later, Marina.
- Okay. You're the best, Donna.

31:23.441 --> 31:26.672
Where's your suspect?

31:26.744 --> 31:29.907
In the can.
He got no flow problem.

31:29.981 --> 31:32.472
Now, look, don't get carried away
with yourself, Francis, okay?

31:32.550 --> 31:34.882
We're just trying to get over on him
how serious the situation is.

31:34.953 --> 31:36.887
Sure. Okay, fine.

31:37.889 --> 31:40.221
Agent Francis of the F.B.I.

31:40.291 --> 31:42.816
The F.B. I?

31:42.894 --> 31:46.295
That's correct, Mr. Herman.
We're looking into the Landucci murder.

31:51.135 --> 31:54.969
The Chemical Bank has no record
of you withdrawing that 150, Greg.

31:55.039 --> 31:59.373
- They don't?
- Don't give me that innocent, bewildered crap, all right?

31:59.444 --> 32:01.412
You lied.
You know it, we know it...

32:01.479 --> 32:04.846
- And the Bureau knows it.
- You only had 10 bucks in that account, Greg.

32:04.916 --> 32:07.976
I don't know why I said that
about the bank.

32:08.052 --> 32:11.488
You guys scare me.
It just popped out of my mouth.

32:11.556 --> 32:15.652
How about you getting those bruises
in a car wreck? That just pop out too, huh?

32:15.727 --> 32:20.164
I had a talk with your friend Jablonski,
who did have a wreck, but you weren't in the car.

32:20.231 --> 32:23.359
I had my reasons
for saying that too.

32:23.434 --> 32:26.562
Uh, I didn't know if you guys
would be talking to my wife or not...

32:26.637 --> 32:29.936
but I got these bruises
over another broad.

32:30.008 --> 32:33.444
And what's this broad's name?
And don't put me on another goose chase.

32:33.511 --> 32:36.412
L- I don't know. I met her in a bar,
and I started coming on to her.

32:36.481 --> 32:40.076
And my hands started wanderin'.
And her boyfriend, he wasn't that big...

32:40.151 --> 32:42.415
but he sure tore me up.

32:42.487 --> 32:45.684
And that's why I told my wife
I got bruised in the wreck with Hank.

32:45.757 --> 32:48.521
And so that's why
I told you that too.

32:48.593 --> 32:51.960
How do you think all this looks, Greg?

32:52.030 --> 32:54.191
- You wanna ask me how it looks?
- No.

32:54.265 --> 32:57.291
You got a cloud over yourself,
with all these lies you've told.

32:57.368 --> 33:00.098
- So you gotta do something to get rid of it.
- Like what?

33:00.171 --> 33:03.607
- Like stand in a lineup.
- I don't wanna do that.

33:03.674 --> 33:06.404
You should have thought
of that earlier.

33:15.253 --> 33:18.051
Well, if I got to, I got to.

33:18.122 --> 33:21.489
- You shave your mustache recently?
- Uh-uh.

33:21.559 --> 33:24.084
We're gonna put some facial hair
on you for the lineup.

33:24.162 --> 33:27.598
- Just for a lark.
- Sit still there until we get some fillers.

33:30.568 --> 33:32.832
No, stay with him, Agent Francis.

33:47.452 --> 33:50.512
- Hey, Greg.
- Hey, James.

33:51.622 --> 33:53.783
Some backup
on the interview rooms, huh?

33:53.858 --> 33:55.951
Yeah, Bobby and Andy
are putting together a lineup...

33:56.027 --> 33:58.018
for that, uh,
shylock homicide.

33:58.096 --> 34:00.496
Yeah, they had to find
some fillers with facial hair.

34:00.565 --> 34:02.829
Yeah, I was down in Holding
with Ron's running buddy.

34:02.900 --> 34:06.301
The guy's completely miserable.
He said he should have never got involved.

34:06.370 --> 34:08.735
Says he's allergic to shellfish
to begin with.

34:08.806 --> 34:12.708
- So he should be an easy flip, huh?
- Yeah, definitely.

34:12.777 --> 34:16.713
Well, we'll see what we get
off my talk with Ron.

34:16.781 --> 34:19.909
Yeah, I'll start the fives
with Adrianne.

34:22.987 --> 34:27.447
You know, not for anything, James,
but, uh...

34:27.525 --> 34:30.688
I think you got some problems
brewing in Adrianne's area.

34:30.761 --> 34:34.389
- I think you're right.
- The green-eyed monster's working overtime.

34:34.465 --> 34:36.399
Greg, we're coming back
from this undercover.

34:36.467 --> 34:39.163
She just about accused me
of sleeping with this girl, Marina.

34:39.237 --> 34:42.034
You should have heard her in the van.
What's he doing in there so long?"

34:42.106 --> 34:44.768
And I offered her
the most mild explanation...

34:44.842 --> 34:46.810
she's on me like
a heat-seeking missile.

34:46.878 --> 34:49.072
I don't know what to do about it.
I never saw it coming...

34:49.147 --> 34:51.081
this aspect of her nature.

34:51.149 --> 34:53.174
She accuses me of asking this girl
for a date...

34:53.251 --> 34:55.844
which is
a whole-cloth fabrication.

34:55.920 --> 34:59.856
Anyways, obviously you're aware of the problem.
You don't need me harpin'.

34:59.924 --> 35:03.189
Yeah. But I gotta address it with her.
No question.

35:03.261 --> 35:06.253
Yeah. You did good work
out there, James.

35:06.330 --> 35:08.423
- Thanks for the backup.
- Yeah.

35:08.499 --> 35:11.559
- You know, you got a definite future as a Teamster.
- Oh.

35:21.812 --> 35:23.609
Hey, boss.

35:26.417 --> 35:29.318
All right. You know how to do it.
Don't be too quick.

35:34.425 --> 35:36.086
- Wow.
- What?

35:36.160 --> 35:39.493
Number five.
He's the guy we were chasing.

35:39.564 --> 35:41.623
Only he don't have the Fu Manchu
and all the hair.

35:42.900 --> 35:44.834
He got busy
with a pair of scissors...

35:44.902 --> 35:47.097
but he's the guy.

35:47.171 --> 35:49.071
I almost picked number two.
I got thrown off on the mustache.

35:49.140 --> 35:51.631
- Okay. Thanks, Shannon.
- All right.

35:51.709 --> 35:53.643
Appreciate it.

35:56.347 --> 35:58.474
Okay, Ken.
Come on. Let's go.

35:58.549 --> 36:00.483
- You get any sleep?
- Yeah, some.

36:02.153 --> 36:04.747
- Ready to do this?
- Man, I oughta have my head examined.

36:04.822 --> 36:07.476
I'm on my bike all afternoon.
The Mafia, they could run me over easy.

36:07.609 --> 36:10.976
If you pick the right guy out, maybe he confesses.
There's not even a trial.

36:11.046 --> 36:14.072
Look, if you're crazy enough
to ride a messenger bike in Manhattan...

36:14.149 --> 36:16.879
you got the guts
to look at a lineup.

36:16.952 --> 36:18.385
- You ready?
- Yeah.

36:18.454 --> 36:21.218
All right.

36:21.290 --> 36:23.315
Recognize anybody?

36:23.392 --> 36:26.327
- Five.
- Where from?

36:26.395 --> 36:30.161
He dumped that old Italian's body.

36:30.232 --> 36:32.257
Okay, latch Parnell
and let the fillers go.

36:32.334 --> 36:34.825
- All right. Thanks, Ken.
- That's it?

36:34.903 --> 36:36.700
Yeah, that's it. Good work.

36:39.808 --> 36:41.298
- Thanks, Ken.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:41.376 --> 36:43.742
You make a collar on this homicide,
that bug has to be disconnected.

36:43.812 --> 36:45.939
- Take it easy, Francis.
- I'm just saying, those are the legalities.

36:46.014 --> 36:49.006
- Yeah.
- I told you it wasn't me.

36:49.084 --> 36:52.349
Yeah, you were right, Parnell.
This one you didn't do.

36:57.092 --> 37:00.027
- This might pinch a little.
- Aah!

37:01.830 --> 37:05.926
Well, Greg, all that cutting your hair off
and shaving off your mustache...

37:06.001 --> 37:08.697
that you did after you whacked Landucci,
that didn't do any good.

37:08.770 --> 37:11.739
You just got I.D.'d
by a civilian and a cop.

37:11.807 --> 37:14.537
Now, thejury's gonna believe them,
so you might be looking at death row.

37:14.610 --> 37:16.703
Now that is a reality.

37:16.778 --> 37:18.973
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

37:19.047 --> 37:21.379
Look.

37:23.418 --> 37:26.114
This Landucci, he had a long record.

37:26.188 --> 37:29.419
He was hooked up.
You had every right to be afraid of him.

37:29.491 --> 37:32.654
What I'm saying, you give a statement
with a self-defense angle...

37:32.728 --> 37:34.958
the D.A. Might go for.

37:35.030 --> 37:37.590
- Did Landucci threaten you?
- What, are you kidding me?

37:37.666 --> 37:41.227
I missed a couple of payments,
and that old bastard sent a couple of guys...

37:41.303 --> 37:43.828
to come over and knock the crap
out of me.

37:43.906 --> 37:47.433
Then he calls me and tells me I gotta stick up
some Arab guy's liquor store to get his money.

37:47.509 --> 37:49.443
- Landucci said this?
- That's right.

37:49.511 --> 37:51.843
Well, you see,
I think he should try self-defense.

37:51.914 --> 37:53.905
- So, did you stick up the liquor store?
- No!

37:53.982 --> 37:57.645
That's when he started talking
about having me whacked.

37:57.719 --> 38:00.654
And I had this gun
I started carrying around...

38:00.722 --> 38:03.156
'cause I didn't know
when it was gonna happen.

38:03.225 --> 38:06.126
And then it was time
for the vig again.

38:06.195 --> 38:10.097
And he came over to my place to get me.
We went out in his car, and we parked.

38:10.165 --> 38:13.430
And he said he was washing his hands of me,
that my time was run out.

38:13.502 --> 38:15.970
I didn't know if it was
gonna happen then or what.

38:16.038 --> 38:19.997
So I showed him the gun.
It didn't even scare him.

38:20.075 --> 38:22.134
And he didn't think
I was gonna do it.

38:22.211 --> 38:24.008
But you did.

38:25.347 --> 38:27.281
Yeah.

38:36.858 --> 38:38.951
I guess I should have
held up the liquor store.

38:47.536 --> 38:49.470
Hey, Donna.
They wanna see us again about the robbery.

38:49.538 --> 38:52.200
- They said there was a break in the case.
- Greg.

38:52.274 --> 38:55.175
- Hey, Diane.
- Did you arrest those bastards yet?

38:55.244 --> 38:57.178
There haven't been
any arrests, no.

38:57.246 --> 38:59.476
But, uh, the property's
been recovered.

38:59.548 --> 39:02.449
- Everything that was stolen?
- Yep.

39:02.517 --> 39:04.678
Well, wait a minute.
Are you sure you got it all?

39:04.753 --> 39:07.688
You gotta be sure, 'cause we already been
to the insurance company.

39:07.756 --> 39:10.224
If we get some of it back
and some of it's still missing...

39:10.292 --> 39:12.658
then we gotta work out
the difference with them.

39:12.728 --> 39:16.095
- Off our list, we got everything.
- Okay, let's go through it.

39:16.164 --> 39:20.726
- You get our money?
- We recovered wallets with $47 and $82 in them.

39:20.802 --> 39:24.670
- Aw, come on.
- See, Diane, we lost two grand apiece...

39:24.740 --> 39:27.766
- plus two Rolex watches.
- On the watches, we just found a couple of cheap knockoffs.

39:29.978 --> 39:32.572
- What about the four TVs?
- We recovered two.

39:32.648 --> 39:35.947
- Uh-uh, there were four.
- Yeah, you see, Diane, you didn't get it all.

39:36.018 --> 39:39.249
And what about the VCR
and the punch bowl and the golf clubs?

39:39.321 --> 39:41.255
Look. None of those things
were there in the first place.

39:41.323 --> 39:46.192
- You calling us liars?
- Yeah, we're saying you filed fraudulent insurance claims.

39:46.261 --> 39:49.753
- That's a felony.
- Oh, get real. You got nothing to back that up.

39:49.831 --> 39:51.560
We know exactly what was in that club.

39:51.633 --> 39:53.430
- How?
- Believe me, we know.

39:53.502 --> 39:56.369
Might be a good idea for you guys
to drop your complaint...

39:56.438 --> 39:58.599
and withdraw those claims.

39:58.674 --> 40:01.268
Aw, look at this.
These are the guys that took us off.

40:01.343 --> 40:03.573
- Do you know what this means?
- Wait a minute.

40:03.645 --> 40:07.638
Are you guys law enforcement? Were you
in there last night putting up the place?

40:07.716 --> 40:09.684
- You writing a book?
- You guys got a problem?

40:09.751 --> 40:12.049
No, no, I ain't got no problem.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.213
We're just standing here
realizing that an ordinary citizen...

40:14.289 --> 40:17.122
doesn't have any rights anymore,
just like Communist Russia.

40:17.192 --> 40:19.717
Who are you guys,
the Watergate burglars?

40:19.795 --> 40:22.923
Why don't you figure that out in the
property room while you pick up your stuff.

40:22.998 --> 40:25.262
How about we call it a draw, boys?

40:25.334 --> 40:28.462
Knockoff watches.

40:28.537 --> 40:30.630
Those watches were 280 apiece.

40:40.282 --> 40:43.945
Mm-hmm. Okay.

40:50.559 --> 40:53.027
I gotta say this, Adrianne.

40:53.095 --> 40:55.256
Go ahead.

40:55.330 --> 40:58.788
- You're driving me a little nuts.
- I knew this was coming.

40:58.867 --> 41:02.325
You made something out of absolutely
nothing between me and that girl.

41:02.404 --> 41:04.372
You make it a case
when I stand up to go to the john.

41:04.439 --> 41:06.771
I never made anything
out of you going to the john.

41:06.842 --> 41:09.709
Point I'm making with you is
you're so alert if I'm doing something wrong...

41:09.778 --> 41:13.612
I wind up- Maybe I want to
just to get away from her for a minute.

41:13.682 --> 41:15.809
Who you saying this to?

41:15.884 --> 41:19.513
Nobody. I mean, that's
my mental conversation.

41:24.860 --> 41:27.795
- I can't stop myself.
- Malarkey.

41:27.863 --> 41:30.855
- I told you we shouldn't get involved.
- That's a cop-out, Adrianne.

41:30.932 --> 41:34.060
You gotta control yourself. If your thoughts
start running away with you...

41:34.136 --> 41:36.070
you gotta realize
that's what's happening.

41:38.306 --> 41:40.297
I was not making a pass
at that girl.

41:42.944 --> 41:44.878
Okay.

41:44.946 --> 41:47.073
Do you believe me?

41:52.154 --> 41:54.486
Hey. Finally giving it up?

41:54.556 --> 41:57.821
Yeah, we're gettin'there.

41:57.893 --> 42:02.023
You know, it wasn't so much
about the shrimp, this hijacking he was doing.

42:02.097 --> 42:07.091
It wasn't so much about the money.
It was more about this Marina.

42:07.169 --> 42:09.228
Uh-huh.

42:09.304 --> 42:12.296
Yeah, he was really jealous
over this girl.

42:12.374 --> 42:14.774
Yeah, well, that, uh,
that could screw you up.

42:36.498 --> 42:39.763
They're gone?

42:39.835 --> 42:42.099
Yeah, the coast is clear.

42:42.170 --> 42:44.104
How'd you leave it with them?

42:44.172 --> 42:47.573
If they leave sleeping dogs lay,
we don't collar 'em for fraud.

42:50.479 --> 42:53.915
I'm gonna tell them
the bug malfunctioned.

42:53.982 --> 42:56.109
It never started to record.

42:56.184 --> 42:58.948
That's between you and Hoover.

43:00.322 --> 43:03.257
Anyways...

43:03.325 --> 43:05.623
I enjoyed working with you guys.

43:05.694 --> 43:07.719
God help me.

43:09.197 --> 43:11.188
Well, you take care
of yourself, Francis.

43:18.106 --> 43:20.199
You're putting another place up...

43:20.275 --> 43:23.438
you need a guy on flashlight?

43:23.512 --> 43:25.446
Keep me in mind.

43:43.331 --> 43:46.459
People, places, the things they do,
the times they do 'em.

43:49.170 --> 43:51.104
There's guys outside
that bodega now.

43:51.172 --> 43:54.266
- There wasn't anybody out there at lunchtime.
- What do you make of that?

43:54.342 --> 43:58.210
I don't know.
Something to do with dope maybe?

43:58.280 --> 44:01.044
There's an old Puerto Rican guy
runs that grocery.

44:01.116 --> 44:03.744
Holds a few horse bets,
pays track odds...

44:03.818 --> 44:07.151
so his customers
don't go to O.T.B.

44:07.222 --> 44:10.521
So these guys are just waiting to see
if they won their bets.

44:10.592 --> 44:12.890
Horses weren't on at lunch.

44:12.961 --> 44:16.488
- How's it goin'?
- How you doin'?

44:16.565 --> 44:18.965
- Guy that gave me my hello back?
- Yeah?

44:19.034 --> 44:20.968
He's an oiler.
He'd like to be a badass...

44:21.036 --> 44:23.971
but more likely he'll step
on his own joint first.

44:24.039 --> 44:27.497
- You making this stuff up?
- I can be wrong.

44:27.576 --> 44:30.977
- How come I believe ya?
- People, places...

44:31.046 --> 44:33.480
- Things they do, times they do 'em.
- There you go.

44:33.548 --> 44:36.915
Stay alert, take it serious,
but you'll have a few laughs too.

44:36.985 --> 44:38.919
Believe me, you'll have some fun.

44:38.987 --> 44:41.717
I believe you, Pop.
