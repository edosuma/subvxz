Randall doing?

00:15.960 --> 00:18.839
Randall was just some

Not unless he was
following orders.

- Your family could use my help.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.833
All right.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.230
Cullens...

39:54.320 --> 39:55.879
you and three men
down at the dock.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.075
Yes, sir.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.440
They just burst
into flames?

40:13.480 --> 40:16.154
I can't keep
talking about it.

40:20.840 --> 40:24.913
And what the hell...

40:25.000 --> 40:26.593
is this?

40:29.520 --> 40:30.590
You got me.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.795
If they got to Ken,
they could get to anyone.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.353
We need to be
more careful.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.510
I need to be
more careful.

40:39.600 --> 40:40.510
You didn't know.

40:40.600 --> 40:41.590
I charged right in.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.710
I didn't pay attention.

40:43.800 --> 40:46.440
"II II"

40:46.520 --> 40:48.431
I could have seen
something in his face.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.590
I don't know.

40:51.280 --> 40:52.953
The guy was wearing
a hell of a mask.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.194
Look, whatever's
going on here,

40:57.280 --> 40:58.270
we can fix it.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.553
What?

41:03.720 --> 41:05.358
Last time I tried
to fix something,

41:05.480 --> 41:06.390
I broke everything.

41:06.480 --> 41:07.390
All right,
come on, Rachel.

41:07.480 --> 41:08.834
Who's to say it's not
gonna happen again?

41:08.880 --> 41:09.950
That is not gonna happen.

41:12.880 --> 41:13.870
I won't let it.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.235
So what do we do?

41:28.480 --> 41:30.073
Well,
this is an occupation.

41:32.160 --> 41:35.710
Every good occupation
deserves a resistance.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.080
Right?

42:51.520 --> 42:53.477
