35:42.432 --> 35:46.141
in an eternal flame
here at the monument.

35:46.811 --> 35:51.896
A memorial is about moving forward,
moving on, together.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.524
To that effect,
I'd like to read a brief epigraph

35:54.694 --> 35:57.071
from someone
who couldn't be here today.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.856
"Make a way in the wilderness.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.865
And do not remember
the former things,

36:03.036 --> 36:04.401
or consider the things of old.

36:04.579 --> 36:08.697
For when you walk through fire,
you shall not be burned,

36:08.875 --> 36:11.833
and the flame shall not consume you."

who would care to speak first?

Uh, I wasn't planning
on saying anything today.

36:30.730 --> 36:34.314
But a lot of you knew my sister,
Angie McAlister.

36:34.776 --> 36:37.609
Some of you knew her as a waitress
at the Sweetbriar.

36:38.655 --> 36:42.113
Some of you knew her
as a volunteer down at the clinic.

you know?

when I came to Chester's Mill.

their hearts to me.

allowed me to open mine.

named Julia Shumway.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.635

37:56.024 --> 37:58.015
She was endless/y curious.

She always had your back.

She was always rooting
for the underdog.

And she couldn't help it.
She just never lost her faith

38:16.628 --> 38:19.290

I've tried everything I know.

52:28.604 --> 52:32.267
Ben's video isn't on his phone
or on the cloud. It's like it—-

52:32.941 --> 52:33.976
Was never there?

52:34.151 --> 52:37.063
You're not gonna, like, fire me, right?
I just got a condo.

52:40.491 --> 52:42.903
Those men on the video,
they can't all be the same guy.

52:43.077 --> 52:44.613
- That is...
- It's crazy.

52:49.416 --> 52:52.374

-Oh, sorry.

Junior?

53:02.554 --> 53:04.169
Hey, Barbie.

53:07.017 --> 53:08.348
You're dead.

53:08.519 --> 53:11.852
- Not the last time I Checked.
- YO, incoming.

53:15.526 --> 53:17.562
- What are you doing here?
JUNIOR: I know. I feel bad

53:17.736 --> 53:20.694
that I missed the memorial,
but my bike broke down.

53:20.864 --> 53:22.274
HUNTER:
We haven't seen you since...

53:23.534 --> 53:24.569
Marrakesh?

53:26.829 --> 53:28.239
You were building homes
for the poor.

53:28.414 --> 53:33.158
Yeah. How weird was it that we ran
into each other in Africa, of all places?

53:33.335 --> 53:36.168
You still seeing that hottie
that drank us under the table?

53:36.338 --> 53:39.375
- What was her name?
- Eva. She's actually here with me.

53:39.550 --> 53:42.542
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to see her.
You know, minus the crap tequila.

53:43.804 --> 53:46.090
Well, I'm not sure how long
we'll be here in town.

53:46.682 --> 53:48.297
NO worries.

53:48.475 --> 53:50.852
I know it must be rough for you,
being back here.

53:51.019 --> 53:52.680
I think about Julia all the time.

53:53.647 --> 53:55.854
Yeah, me too.

53:57.317 --> 53:58.978
Just glad you were able to move on.

53:59.153 --> 54:01.189
If anyone deserves happiness,
it's you.

54:01.363 --> 54:04.446
I appreciate that.
Hey, I'm gonna let you two catch up.

54:04.616 --> 54:07.198
I gotta go check on something.
But it's good seeing you, Junior.

54:07.369 --> 54:09.109
You tOO, man.

54:16.378 --> 54:18.960
DO you really think this'll work?

54:19.131 --> 54:21.964
When Barbie used the dome like this
tO write me a message,

54:22.134 --> 54:24.420
he was taken away by armed men.

54:24.595 --> 54:27.132
- They were watching us.
- My father's men?

54:27.890 --> 54:29.471
Let's hope they're still watching.

54:31.810 --> 54:35.143
She needs the egg. Let me take
the egg back to Chester's Mill.

54:35.314 --> 54:38.351
I think that the dome may
very well be its power source.

54:38.525 --> 54:42.359
You know, 25 years ago,
a meteor storm bombarded the Earth.

54:44.823 --> 54:46.905
A year after that,

54:47.075 --> 54:49.691
the first fragments Of one
of these so-called eggs

54:49.870 --> 54:52.361
was found in a meteor
near our drilling site in Alaska.

54:52.831 --> 54:54.241
With the government's blessing,

54:54.416 --> 54:57.283
I’ve devoted the resources
of this company to track down

54:57.461 --> 54:59.167
every meteor that fell that night.

55:00.255 --> 55:02.462
This was the only egg
that was found intact.

55:02.633 --> 55:07.093
SO you can imagine my reluctance
tO letting it leave this facility.

55:07.262 --> 55:12.177
If the egg isn't returned,
we risk losing everyone inside.

55:12.351 --> 55:15.058
Eh, I don't give a damn
about anyone in Chester's Mill.

55:15.229 --> 55:16.935
Uh, no offense to your daughter.

55:17.397 --> 55:20.230
Your son is trapped
under the dome as well, no?

55:20.400 --> 55:24.393
- That's not relevant.
- NO, no, no, I disagree.

55:24.571 --> 55:27.563
If I allow you to take this egg back,
that's a one-way ticket.

55:28.033 --> 55:31.275
I need to know that you're doing this
for the good of the company

55:31.453 --> 55:33.739
and not
for some sentimental reason.

55:33.914 --> 55:35.950
We want the same thing,

55:36.291 --> 55:39.203
tO unlock and harvest
the power Of the egg

55:39.378 --> 55:44.293
and the secrets it holds,
regardless of costs.

55:47.636 --> 55:49.592
You think my father got my message?

55:49.763 --> 55:52.095
I have to believe he did.

55:53.851 --> 55:55.842
And this is where he'll surface
from Zenith.

55:58.355 --> 56:00.971
What was it like in the cocoons?

56:02.609 --> 56:04.065
Being asleep.

56:07.614 --> 56:08.694
What is it?

56:09.700 --> 56:12.783
If my father returns with the egg,

56:13.453 --> 56:16.911
what do I even say to him?
It's been so long.

56:17.082 --> 56:19.368
You don't have to say anything.

56:20.419 --> 56:21.454

this one small thing for you.

at the first sign of my father.

57:33.951 --> 57:37.034
Eagle One,
how should we proceed?

57:37.204 --> 57:39.240
Just hold Off
until the team has arrived.

59:23.185 --> 59:26.097
Eva, please, this is important.
How did we meet?

59:27.272 --> 59:29.809
It was at that dive bar in Marrakesh.

Your tall friend kept buying me drinks,
but all I could look at was you.

59:33.403 --> 59:36.110
His name. What was his name?

59:36.698 --> 59:40.532

His name was James Rennie

59:50.670 --> 59:53.798

I'm so sorry. This is my fault.

1:00:16.029 --> 1:00:19.647
I thought coming back to Chester's Mill
would be good for you, for us.

1:00:19.825 --> 1:00:22.032
- But it's just upsetting you.
- You're not listening.

He was in the video.
That's what Ben wanted to show me.

1:00:52.816 --> 1:00:55.808
Then the video disappeared.
Ben told me before he died

1:00:55.986 --> 1:00:58.272
that he felt like
someone was watching him, Okay?

- I'm so pissed at her.
- Life becomes so much easier

when you learn tO accept
the apology you never got.

1:01:55.128 --> 1:01:57.710
You can't expect her to be sorry
for being happy.

1:01:59.174 --> 1:02:02.337
She said I was still trapped
under a dome, because Of Angie.

1:02:03.803 --> 1:02:04.883
Am I?

1:02:05.764 --> 1:02:07.425
Let me ask you something.

1:02:07.599 --> 1:02:10.636
You have always dreamed
of being an engineer,

1:02:10.810 --> 1:02:13.222
a builder, an inventor.
SO why do you think

your acceptance letter to Caltech,

all your goals?

but If you really wanna know
whether you're still living under a dome,

1:02:33.208 --> 1:02:37.542
maybe it's time you forgive
the person who put you there.

1:02:37.712 --> 1:02:39.373
NO. NO way.

1:02:40.048 --> 1:02:43.632
You have kept your feelings
regarding Sam buried for so long.

1:02:43.802 --> 1:02:45.963
They're like a chain
weighing you down.

1:02:46.137 --> 1:02:48.924
I don't want them to stop you
from reaching your true potential.

1:02:49.099 --> 1:02:51.306
I have nothing tO say
tO Sam Verdreaux.

1:02:51.476 --> 1:02:53.512
Then just listen.

1:02:53.687 --> 1:02:56.224
He's as much a prisoner
of the past as you are.

1:02:56.398 --> 1:03:00.186

you're the one holding all the keys.

1:03:17.127 --> 1:03:20.039

- Your friend, Hunter.

All it takes is a free latte,

1:03:43.570 --> 1:03:44.980
after a natural disaster.

1:03:45.155 --> 1:03:47.146
There was nothing natural
about the dome.

Well, "unnatural disaster" just sounds
a little tOO Fox News.

The town didn't lose my father.
I killed him to protect it.

1:04:24.402 --> 1:04:26.438
SO if the reason you're here
is tO see how I'm doing

1:04:26.613 --> 1:04:29.355
since the dome came down,
ridding myself of my father

1:04:29.532 --> 1:04:31.944
was the best thing I've ever done.
Now, if you don't mind...

1:04:35.246 --> 1:04:36.656
I'm just curious.

1:04:37.415 --> 1:04:41.533

is the best thing you've ever done,

You're part Of this town, you're part Of
a community that needs you right now.

1:04:54.599 --> 1:04:55.930
I can never be part Of this town.

1:04:56.101 --> 1:04:59.184
My father made sure Of that.
You wanna know why I left?

1:04:59.354 --> 1:05:01.766
Because everyone around here
thinks I'm just like him.

1:05:02.774 --> 1:05:05.311

you stop running away
