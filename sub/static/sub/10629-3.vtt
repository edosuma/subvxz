When I think of the goodness of Jesus
and all that He's done for me,

03:58.655 --> 04:01.158
my soul shouts out, "Hallelujah."

04:01.241 --> 04:03.701
- Hallelujah!
- Amen.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.915
That was absolutely beautiful.

04:07.998 --> 04:13.921
You sang it as heavenly
and as loudly as we do in Dallas. Amen!

04:14.004 --> 04:16.548
Amen.

04:18.550 --> 04:23.138
My mother and I are proud to introduce
a man who fought for you in Congress.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.141
He's fighting for you now
in the White House.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.893
We wanna help him to stay there.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.978
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:30.062 --> 04:31.897
President Frank Underwood!

04:31.980 --> 04:33.273
All right!

04:33.356 --> 04:36.526
Thank you.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.165
You're all wonderful.

04:50.248 --> 04:53.168
Thank you.
Please be seated.

04:55.503 --> 04:59.507
You know, it's on a morning like this,
in a church like yours,

04:59.591 --> 05:02.552
that I'm very proud
to be a South Carolinian.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.725
"How many of you drove to church?

05:08.809 --> 05:11.937
Let me start by asking, how many of you
drove to church here this morning?"

05:12.020 --> 05:14.439
How many of you drove
to get to church here this morning?

05:15.941 --> 05:18.026
And how many of you drove together?

05:18.110 --> 05:19.903
Well, I can appreciate that.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.198
Gas prices right now are putting a strain
on everybody's pocketbooks.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.033
Isn't that true?

05:25.117 --> 05:26.576
I think maybe more here in Gaffney,

05:26.659 --> 05:28.871
at least I feel it here in Gaffney
more than anywhere else.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.372
"Especially here in Gaffney.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.040
Now, as president,
I feel responsible for that.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.292
Or maybe, I feel even more so here.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.711
You know, we've never been a rich town.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.234
You know, a lot of times in my childhood,
I thought to myself,

05:39.297 --> 05:42.259
'Why, we just, we were almost like
an invisible town to people...

05:42.342 --> 05:44.177
We didn't matter.'"

05:44.261 --> 05:46.513
That we didn't matter.

05:46.596 --> 05:48.556
And, of course, I was a white boy.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.809
And as poor as my family was,

05:51.894 --> 05:54.104
we still were a lot better off
than a lot of your families...

05:54.187 --> 05:56.439
who not only had to
struggle through poverty

05:56.523 --> 05:58.275
but had to fight racism as well.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.777
Now, how many of you remember 1973?

06:00.860 --> 06:03.196
"Now, how many of you remember 1973?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.908
When gas prices were
as bad as they are today,

06:05.991 --> 06:09.995
and we had to wait hours
just to fill our tank.

06:10.078 --> 06:14.499
Why, OPEC was trying
to hold us hostage then

06:14.582 --> 06:18.086
just as Russia's trying
to hold us hostage now.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.963
But somehow...

06:20.047 --> 06:22.799
our little community, why,
we came together, didn't we?

06:22.882 --> 06:24.842
We came together, didn't we?"
Yes.

06:24.927 --> 06:29.181
We looked out for each other.
We were there for each other.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.224
Now, maybe we didn't matter
to the rest of the country,

06:31.308 --> 06:33.518
but we sure as heck
mattered to each other.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.896
<i>We're still struggling with poverty,</i>

06:36.980 --> 06:39.649
<i>and racism is still something
we have to fight against.</i>

06:39.732 --> 06:42.945
<i>But I know that this town does matter.</i>

06:44.779 --> 06:47.490
That all of you matter.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.118
And I don't just say that
because African Americans

06:50.202 --> 06:51.869
represent half the vote in this state.

06:53.871 --> 06:57.667
I say that because,
despite our troubles...

06:57.750 --> 07:00.837
we are one community.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.965
One family.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.342
<i>And that gives us strength.</i>

07:07.594 --> 07:10.847
<i>That strength is a powerful thing.</i>

07:10.931 --> 07:13.225
<i>It's not invisible.</i>

07:13.308 --> 07:14.851
It radiates.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.813
I place my faith in God
to give me purpose.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.444
I put my hope in you to give me strength.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.113
Yes, sir.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.407
And come tomorrow,
when you vote...

07:29.491 --> 07:32.535
I hope that you will
place your trust in me...

07:33.954 --> 07:38.959
...to help continue to lead this country
as we have led this community, together.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.252
Thank you all very much.

07:46.008 --> 07:47.050
Good morning.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.219
I'm LeAnn Harvey, traveling to Washington.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.845
The First Lady isn't here yet,
Ms. Harvey,

07:50.928 --> 07:52.430
but you're welcome to board the plane,
if you'd like.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.517
Uh, no, I'll wait until she gets here.
Thank you.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.601
Aidan.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.020
<i>Hey,
I just sent the research.</i>

07:58.103 --> 08:02.024
- What's the gist?
- The anger, it's biblical.

08:02.107 --> 08:05.068
- Uh, gas prices?
<i>- Yeah, gas is school.</i>

08:05.152 --> 08:06.694
Gas is work.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.073
Gas is the family trip to Disneyland.

08:10.157 --> 08:14.827
Every cent it goes up
is another six points on the anger index.

08:14.911 --> 08:18.706
We predict that $7 a gallon
will get you riots.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.208
What about the First Lady?

08:20.292 --> 08:24.421
<i>Oh, she's faring better than he is.
Sympathy for the sick mother.</i>

08:24.504 --> 08:26.006
Thanks for the rush job on this.

08:26.089 --> 08:29.551
Well, you're a friend.
And this is far more interesting than...

08:29.634 --> 08:32.636
testing names of anti-depressants
for five-year-olds, or...

08:32.720 --> 08:36.224
<i>what color cross trainers
soccer moms will drool over.</i>

08:36.308 --> 08:39.019
- I thought you hated politics.
<i>- I do.</i>

08:39.102 --> 08:42.647
But anger?
And seduction?

08:42.730 --> 08:45.150
Those are interesting.

08:48.778 --> 08:52.032
- Mother, my earrings.
- Yes?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.366
You took them.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.285
I did no such thing.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.421
I said I don't...

09:09.507 --> 09:13.345
You're taking my money.
I took something of yours.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.517
Claire...

09:21.478 --> 09:24.522
When you leave today,
I don't want you coming back.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.817
Oh, I'll come and go as I please, Mother.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.189
This is unreal.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.940
You sure we can count on this guy?

10:08.024 --> 10:10.985
He loathes Francis.
That we can count on.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.321
But use your best judgment.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.864
Who compiled this?

10:14.947 --> 10:18.285
An analytics firm I contract with,
one of the best in the country.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.413
- They can be trusted?
- Yes. I work directly with the owner.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.334
Francis really needs this win
in South Carolina.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.710
He sure does.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.713
Let's release more
of the strategic reserve.

10:30.797 --> 10:34.091
<i>That might slow down
the price inflation, but it won't halt it.</i>

10:35.051 --> 10:37.345
How are you two ladies
enjoying those ribs?

10:37.429 --> 10:40.598
Mmm, I'm gonna need a nap after this.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.518
Well, you'll have time. I have two hours
of fundraising calls to make.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.188
It was very nice of you to let us
stay at your house, Mr. President.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.071
Well, that's how we do things
here in Gaffney.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.149
<i>Sir?</i>

10:49.232 --> 10:52.610
Listen, I am not gonna negotiate a bailout
if he won't budge on privatization.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.529
If he wants to let his own people starve,
so be it.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.692
<i>He may look for relief from Beijing,
and that would...</i>

10:56.739 --> 10:58.539
The only thing he hates
more than us is China.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.659
He won't kowtow.

10:59.742 --> 11:02.579
<i>But if Petrov does cave to them,
that puts the global energy...</i>

11:02.662 --> 11:04.142
Look, Cathy, I have to call you back.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.082
- When?
- About 30 minutes ago.

11:08.585 --> 11:12.339
- So this will be your box, number 433.
- Thank you.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.799
Would you like to open up
a savings account with us?

11:14.882 --> 11:16.301
- Debit card?
- No, the box is fine.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.385
Okay.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.430
- Would you mind if I...
- Oh, sure. I'll give you some privacy.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.848
Thank you.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.411
Good to see you.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.621
You, too, Francis.

13:08.705 --> 13:09.789
I'm surprised.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.916
I don't hear from you,
then you just show up.

13:11.999 --> 13:15.670
Mmm, to be honest,
I wasn't sure until I landed.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.092
You've gotten some sun.

13:21.884 --> 13:25.388
Tractor-pulling event yesterday.
I should've worn a hat.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.934
- Are Doris and Celia here?
- They were.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.936
I set up cots for them in the guest room,

13:32.019 --> 13:34.481
but when I heard you were coming,
I sent them off to a hotel.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.649
I figured you'd want
that room for yourself.

13:37.359 --> 13:39.193
That's very thoughtful.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.530
You have an event now.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.866
Limestone College.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.493
Well, I'll join you.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.411
They'll be there,
if you'd rather not see...

13:48.495 --> 13:50.037
It'll be fine.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.458
Unless you'd rather I not go.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.251
No, I'd love you to come.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.841
- If he knows I'm involved...
- So make sure he doesn't.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.719
Can I see it?

14:14.103 --> 14:15.855
Oh, boy.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.360
Now, this could get interesting.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.194
We need it done by tomorrow morning.

14:24.113 --> 14:27.492
Well, my cousin has a friend,
owns an industrial print shop,

14:27.575 --> 14:28.868
but a job that size...

14:28.951 --> 14:30.537
This should cover it.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.462
And then some.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.173
Oh, I didn't know Heather Dunbar
had it in her.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.467
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Chase.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.555
Well, are you sure you wouldn't
like some iced tea?

14:48.638 --> 14:50.598
Thank you, no.
I should get going.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.396
How about some fries with that shake?

14:58.690 --> 15:02.610
Get done what I want done.
Don't make me come back here.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.264
- What did Manny say?
- I got your shift, bro.

15:32.348 --> 15:35.309
- What about the car?
- The Fusion.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.145
I can reset the odometer,
park it in front of your place after work.

15:38.229 --> 15:40.607
But, hey...
you gotta get it back by tomorrow night.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.150
- Otherwise, when they do the inventory...
- I promise you.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.736
All right.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.238
So the cost.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.448
As soon as I get my paycheck, I'll...

15:48.531 --> 15:51.075
No. I don't want money.

15:54.537 --> 15:57.414
Most of the other guys work here,
they ain't much to look at.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.709
You?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.503
Keep lookin' over.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.631
Hey, man, listen...

16:04.714 --> 16:07.467
- You want the car or not?
- I'll find some other way.

16:10.845 --> 16:11.888
Yo.

16:13.180 --> 16:14.849
I know about you.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.352
I seen your parole officer
come check in on you.

16:18.435 --> 16:21.564
What would he say about
you taking one of these cars?

16:26.402 --> 16:27.487
Come on.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.490
Get in.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.182
I just learned today
that Limestone College,

16:56.265 --> 16:57.684
founded in 1845,

16:57.767 --> 17:01.729
was the first women's college
in South Carolina,

17:01.813 --> 17:03.606
and one of the first in the nation.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.441
And that's something to be proud of.

17:08.986 --> 17:13.616
And since then, this school
and its students have flourished.

17:13.700 --> 17:19.914
A young, eager community of men and women
of all races and backgrounds,

17:19.997 --> 17:22.750
a true reflection of America's future.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.423
How did he convince you to come back?

17:30.341 --> 17:33.385
I convinced myself.

17:33.469 --> 17:37.139
Forty-six years I was married
to my husband before he passed.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.852
But if he'd pulled on me
what Frank pulled on you,

17:40.935 --> 17:42.812
he would've been long gone.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.793
I think it's worked out for the best.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.275
Your daughter is going to make
a fabulous congresswoman.

17:48.359 --> 17:49.986
Well, thank you.

17:50.069 --> 17:53.239
Two minutes.

17:53.322 --> 17:56.408
Now, Frank Underwood understands
the need for equality,

17:56.492 --> 17:59.829
in education and throughout our lives.

17:59.912 --> 18:04.083
Most of all, he believes
in giving every American

18:04.166 --> 18:07.128
the opportunity to earn a living.

18:07.211 --> 18:10.923
He put this belief into action before
and he will again,

18:11.007 --> 18:16.012
and Frank Underwood will not allow
this journey to end with Limestone.

18:16.095 --> 18:20.850
You will go out into this world
and astonish us all with your intellect,

18:20.933 --> 18:23.645
your... your worthiness,
and your strength.

18:28.524 --> 18:32.111
Now, I would like to introduce
two of the strongest women I know.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.031
Well, don't you look thick as thieves.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.994
...and the First Lady
of the United States, Claire Underwood.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.712
It's as though she never left.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.505
And that's what I'm afraid of.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.611
All right,
let's hurry on up, now.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.663
Bugayev is telling me
that they are willing

19:23.746 --> 19:28.000
to reduce their oil output by another 20%
by the first of next month.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.336
What are the projections on gas prices?

19:30.419 --> 19:32.463
<i>North of 150 a barrel for oil.</i>

19:32.546 --> 19:34.924
Six, maybe $7 a gallon for fuel.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.093
My phone has been
ringing off the hook, sir,

19:37.176 --> 19:38.803
from the U.K. to Poland.

19:38.886 --> 19:42.431
<i>The IMF wants to help us
with the debt relief solution.</i>

20:05.621 --> 20:06.622
<i>Sir?</i>

20:08.290 --> 20:12.253
We need to respond to strength
with strength.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.216
Well, I don't know how
we could be any stronger,

20:14.296 --> 20:17.091
other than to invade Russia.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.720
And what if we do?

20:22.304 --> 20:25.432
- Excuse me, sir?
<i>- Not with troops.</i>

20:25.516 --> 20:27.351
With fear.

20:27.434 --> 20:28.853
He's never trusted us.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.647
He already thinks
we're behind Milkin's failed coup.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.400
What if we put Milkin
in a position to succeed.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.111
<i>Now, I don't care
if Milkin actually succeeds.</i>

20:37.194 --> 20:41.073
<i>Unfreeze all his assets.
Fly him to a border country.</i>

20:41.157 --> 20:43.785
Put him in a room with other dissidents.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.830
Petrov needs to know
that we'll stop at nothing.

20:47.914 --> 20:51.417
Sir, the diplomatic repercussions
of such an action...

20:51.500 --> 20:53.585
All I want is the appearance.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.923
Let's look at best and worst case
scenarios as soon as possible.

20:57.006 --> 20:58.132
Thank you very much.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.770
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were...

21:53.855 --> 21:55.982
That bed was too stiff.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.318
- I'll sleep in there then.
- Sleep in here.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.135
We had the mattress on the floor.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.386
What?

22:26.971 --> 22:29.806
That first year,
the mattress and those lumpy pillows.

22:31.058 --> 22:33.895
Which you used to steal from me
in the middle of the night.

22:33.978 --> 22:36.730
Well, because you would hog
all the covers.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.607
God, we were living like heathens.

22:38.690 --> 22:43.070
Well, because we were
spending everything we had on the race.

22:44.655 --> 22:47.992
I remember I used to think this place
was a palace, though.

22:50.411 --> 22:53.289
- It was.
- Not compared to the ranch.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.208
Well, it was a palace because it was ours.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.921
Good night, Francis.

24:12.868 --> 24:14.870
The press has surrounded the house.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.999
I can't leave the damn place
until I know exactly what I'm gonna say.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.125
We need to cancel your events.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.667
Of course we need to cancel my events.

24:20.751 --> 24:23.231
- The expression on my face is a...
- What's going on?

24:23.295 --> 24:24.796
<i>...taken in a nondescript location,</i>

24:24.880 --> 24:27.716
<i>does not seem to be
a direct endorsement for the KKK.</i>

24:28.300 --> 24:30.344
- My God.
- My father.

24:31.762 --> 24:35.474
Sir? Congresswoman Jones
is heading back to Texas.

24:35.557 --> 24:38.894
Get her on the phone for me, right now.
Meechum, I need you to do me a favor.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.271
<i>There are no clues at the moment</i>

24:40.354 --> 24:42.148
<i>as to who may be responsible,</i>

24:42.231 --> 24:45.442
<i>but Gaffney PD is taking
the canvas picture down</i>

24:45.526 --> 24:48.126
<i>within the hour for further examination.</i>

24:49.030 --> 24:50.906
On primary day.

24:51.615 --> 24:54.368
I can't verify anything yet
in terms of who it is,

24:54.451 --> 24:56.412
or even whether it's real, or...

25:01.958 --> 25:04.211
The day before New Hampshire,
there's a marriage story,

25:04.295 --> 25:06.130
and now in South Carolina we have this?

25:07.089 --> 25:08.674
Uh, how are we getting blindsided?

25:10.008 --> 25:11.510
- I should get that...
- Let it ring.

25:13.762 --> 25:14.930
Look...

25:15.013 --> 25:18.016
I didn't even know about
the fight until you told me.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.061
And how was I supposed
to know about this photo?

25:20.144 --> 25:22.646
Because it is your job
to get out ahead of this shit.

25:22.729 --> 25:25.524
The oppo team should've tracked this down.
That's the campaign.

25:25.607 --> 25:28.610
So, if Vaughn didn't know,
or the president didn't tell him...

25:28.694 --> 25:31.988
It has to be somebody close to him.
Someone with a lot of access.

25:34.116 --> 25:35.617
The president's on the line.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.167
Sir, it's Doug.
I'm in here with Seth.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.961
I'm gonna tell the truth.
I'm gonna say it is my father.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.379
<i>That's probably
the best response,</i>

25:47.463 --> 25:48.714
<i>if you have a good way to frame it.</i>

25:48.797 --> 25:51.092
I know what to say.
The question is where.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.844
One-on-one.
Something exclusive.

25:53.927 --> 25:56.607
Not in front of the media.
I need to connect directly to the voters,

25:56.680 --> 25:57.931
the African American voters.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.725
Mr. President,
I've got the Secretary of State.

25:59.808 --> 26:01.352
I'll call her back.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.312
Hang on, boys.
Meechum?

26:03.395 --> 26:05.606
It's here, sir.

26:05.689 --> 26:06.773
<i>What can you tell me?</i>

26:06.857 --> 26:10.736
Yesterday, a woman named Leslie McIntyre
opened a new box.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.614
<i>I'm having the name run now,
but it looks like she used a fake social.</i>

26:13.697 --> 26:15.407
What about security footage?

26:15.491 --> 26:16.700
<i>They reset the cameras every morning.</i>

26:16.783 --> 26:17.903
I asked what she looked like

26:17.951 --> 26:20.287
and all the manager said
is that it was a Caucasian brunette.

26:20.371 --> 26:21.497
Nothing strange about her.

26:21.580 --> 26:25.167
All right. Bring the box back here.
Don't let it out of your sight.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.964
As far as I know,
there's only one photograph.

26:31.047 --> 26:32.799
<i>Meechum says it's still at the bank.</i>

26:35.386 --> 26:36.512
Sir, it's just me.

26:38.639 --> 26:40.182
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

26:40.266 --> 26:41.475
Yes, sir.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.561
<i>Well, you keep an eye on him.</i>

26:49.191 --> 26:52.194
I want emails and phone records
of everyone in the White House.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.280
Including yours.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.365
Mine?
You honestly think...

26:56.448 --> 26:58.450
Is there a problem?

26:58.534 --> 26:59.618
No.

27:01.077 --> 27:02.204
Good.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.545
<i>It's unfortunate.</i>

27:09.628 --> 27:11.297
<i>Ms. Dunbar!
Ms. Dunbar? Ms. Dunbar?</i>

27:11.380 --> 27:12.714
<i>The imagery...</i>

27:12.798 --> 27:16.885
<i>That anyone would try to inflame
racial discord by doing something so base.</i>

27:16.968 --> 27:19.263
<i>Whether it's Calvin Underwood
isn't the point.</i>

27:19.346 --> 27:22.098
<i>If it is,
and we have no confirmation on that,</i>

27:22.183 --> 27:24.851
<i>I mean...
Who put this up? And why?</i>

27:24.935 --> 27:29.481
<i>Who knows. And the sins of the father
aren't necessarily the sins of the son.</i>

27:29.565 --> 27:32.651
<i>But... it's troubling.
Very troubling.</i>

27:33.944 --> 27:37.113
<i>Stunts like these have the potential
to open old wounds.</i>

27:37.198 --> 27:40.451
<i>We can't let that happen.
We need to rise above it.</i>

27:40.534 --> 27:43.370
<i>Make clear,
no matter who you support,</i>

27:43.454 --> 27:45.914
<i>that this sort of behavior
will not be tolerated.</i>

27:45.997 --> 27:48.250
Get me Reverend Clark
and Gene Clancy on the phone.

28:09.938 --> 28:12.399
Hey, they want you out by the bus.

28:12.483 --> 28:13.567
By the bus?

28:13.650 --> 28:15.319
- Um, who are you?
- Sorry.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.862
Mark from the Butler County office.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.280
They want all the Cincinnati volunteers

28:18.364 --> 28:20.156
to gather by the bus
for a photo with Dunbar.

28:20.241 --> 28:21.921
Jenn told me I wasn't supposed to leave...

28:21.992 --> 28:24.495
That's why she sent me.
She didn't want you to miss the photo. Go.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.204
Out by the bus?

28:26.288 --> 28:27.623
She told me to cover for you.

28:28.624 --> 28:29.875
Okay, um...

28:29.958 --> 28:33.337
well, there were a couple of no-shows,
but, you know, otherwise, everyone's here.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.631
- Okay. Thanks.
- Very convenient. Thanks.

28:35.714 --> 28:36.840
Enjoy.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.797
I'm David Grimes
with the <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer.</i>

29:16.713 --> 29:17.714
Where's your credential?

29:17.798 --> 29:20.216
I was an idiot and left it in the car.

29:20.301 --> 29:23.929
They recognized me
at the check-in desk, though.

29:24.012 --> 29:27.140
I can direct you to the bullpen,
but this area is off-limits to the press.

29:27.223 --> 29:29.268
I'm actually supposed to do an interview
with Cynthia Driscoll.

29:29.351 --> 29:31.978
The Advance guys
said I should come this way.

29:33.146 --> 29:34.565
Wait here.

29:43.574 --> 29:46.993
I'm sorry, Mr. President,
we just can't do it.

29:47.077 --> 29:49.871
Forty-five percent of the vote here
is African American.

29:49.955 --> 29:53.249
You and your mother standing by my side
would go a long way to put this...

29:53.334 --> 29:57.087
I am running for Congress
in a black and Latino district.

29:57.170 --> 30:00.674
My mother was beaten
and hosed down in marches.

30:00.757 --> 30:04.135
You want us to vouch for a man
whose father was in the KKK?

30:04.219 --> 30:07.222
- No, he was not in the Klan.
<i>- That was him in that picture.</i>

30:07.306 --> 30:08.682
Yes, but I've explained that.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.601
<i>This is the state
where the Civil War started,</i>

30:10.684 --> 30:13.061
where you can still see
rebel flags on bumper stickers.

30:13.144 --> 30:17.566
There is a history
of racist brutality here, Mr. President.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.485
Those sort of symbols matter.

30:20.402 --> 30:22.195
<i>Could you put your mother on, please?</i>

30:25.281 --> 30:26.617
Mom?

30:26.700 --> 30:28.369
He wants to speak to you.

30:32.664 --> 30:33.790
Mr. President.

30:33.874 --> 30:37.711
Listen, we need to stand together.
Now, I've endorsed Celia.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.755
Claire can do a great deal
for her in Texas.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.216
She's better off
without the Underwoods at this point.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.718
But what about your clinic?

30:44.801 --> 30:48.096
<i>Imagine how that would look,
holding our clinic for ransom.</i>

30:48.179 --> 30:51.099
I'm appealing to your goodwill,
Congresswoman.

30:51.182 --> 30:55.020
When we stop getting beaten and shot...

30:55.979 --> 30:58.273
you'll have my goodwill, Mr. President.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.651
Goodbye.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.242
Get me Gene Clancy again.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.748
What if it's Oren Chase, Francis?

31:14.831 --> 31:18.084
He could've gotten his hands on a copy.
There may be more than one.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.380
Meechum first, then Clancy.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.470
Lucas?

31:29.721 --> 31:31.515
We need to talk.

31:31.598 --> 31:33.975
- I thought you were...
- I was. I'm... I'm out now.

31:34.935 --> 31:36.603
This is important.

31:37.479 --> 31:40.148
Mr. President, was your father a racist?

31:47.238 --> 31:49.365
Was your father a racist?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.871
Mrs. Underwood,
is your mother okay?

31:57.248 --> 31:58.291
Mr. President!

32:03.046 --> 32:04.798
- Mr. Chase?
- Who are you?

32:04.881 --> 32:06.967
United States Secret Service.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.770
We're not after you, Mr. Chase.
We're after whoever put you up to it.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.430
Put me up to what?

32:11.513 --> 32:14.975
You can answer me here, or we can go to
the Columbia field office for questioning.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.351
I have no idea what you're talking about.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.115
All right,
I need you to come with me, sir.

32:18.186 --> 32:20.146
- Now, hold on.
- Step outside, sir.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.649
I wanna talk to a lawyer.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.770
- I need backup at 4126.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

32:25.819 --> 32:28.363
- Come on, that's not necessary.
- Not if you cooperate, sir.

32:30.365 --> 32:32.618
If I talk to you,
I won't get in trouble?

32:33.952 --> 32:36.538
I swear to God, Ms. Dunbar.
It's all true.

32:36.622 --> 32:37.664
Then where's the proof?

32:37.748 --> 32:41.084
I don't have the means,
but you do.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.419
You've investigated him before.
You know he's dangerous.

32:43.504 --> 32:44.505
Mr. Goodwin...

32:44.588 --> 32:46.256
Why would he go after me
if I wasn't onto something?

32:46.339 --> 32:49.092
This was a high-level sting operation.

32:49.175 --> 32:51.595
Major resources were dedicated to it.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.346
I'm... I was a journalist,
no criminal record.

32:53.429 --> 32:55.265
How am I suddenly such a threat,
unless I'm...

32:55.348 --> 32:56.808
Even if I did believe you,

32:56.892 --> 33:00.311
I am no longer part of the DOJ.
I am a private citizen now.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.105
Who's running for president...

33:02.188 --> 33:04.315
Aren't you breaking WITSEC protocol
by being here?

33:04.399 --> 33:05.901
I am no longer comfortable with this.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.153
- You're... you're my last chance. Please!
- Hey, hey.

33:08.236 --> 33:10.196
- I suggest that you go back home.
- I'm... The things I've...

33:10.280 --> 33:12.658
- Don't make us get security involved.
- Please. Just...

33:12.741 --> 33:15.118
Just give us five minutes
until she's out of the building.

33:15.201 --> 33:17.579
Please.
Please listen to me.

33:17.663 --> 33:19.831
I'm... I'm begging you.

33:19.915 --> 33:21.708
Just help me...

33:21.792 --> 33:23.334
Help.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.803
Please, please...

33:35.514 --> 33:36.848
Oh, God...

33:38.141 --> 33:40.185
How could you put me in a room with him?

33:40.268 --> 33:41.895
I didn't know what he was gonna say.

33:41.978 --> 33:43.814
But I assumed that
if he went to such great lengths...

33:43.897 --> 33:47.067
The DUI, that's all he has proof of.
That's nothing.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.902
Even I have helped people
get off for that.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.613
- There's the affair...
- With no evidence.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.990
Then he leaps to murder...
Two murders?

33:54.074 --> 33:55.992
The man is troubled.

33:56.076 --> 33:57.744
We saw the look in his eye.

33:57.828 --> 34:00.371
I thought he might have
something real.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.915
He used to be a good editor.

34:01.998 --> 34:04.042
And now he is a convicted felon.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.794
You said no stone unturned.

34:08.504 --> 34:11.382
I'm sorry,
I should have thought better of it.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.801
Yes, you should have.

34:15.136 --> 34:17.973
Let's let it go.
How are we doing in South Carolina?

34:18.056 --> 34:19.683
Early exit polls are good.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.978
- We have a shot at winning.
- Actually winning?

34:23.061 --> 34:25.021
That billboard's done real damage.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.737
I appreciate you doing this, Gene.
You're really saving my life here.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.239
Just remember it
when I run for county executive.

34:35.322 --> 34:37.199
I'll be down here whenever you need me.

34:37.283 --> 34:40.245
Oh, it's not the when, it's the what.
And how much.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.626
Afternoon, Oren.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.585
- Mr. President.
- Have a seat.

34:52.090 --> 34:55.594
Didn't you learn your lesson
with all that Peachoid nonsense?

34:56.887 --> 34:59.598
Well, you promised
to help me with the 4th.

35:03.143 --> 35:05.771
I let my bitterness get the better of me.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.063
Mmm-hmm.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.191
Who specifically approached you?
A woman?

35:10.275 --> 35:12.277
- Brunette?
- Yeah.

35:12.360 --> 35:16.364
Uh, about so tall, good-looking.

35:16.447 --> 35:18.033
Wouldn't give me her name.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.276
We should get photos

35:19.325 --> 35:21.870
of everyone in Dunbar's staff
that fits that description.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.496
Already compiling it, ma'am.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.501
And as for you...

35:28.584 --> 35:31.546
you're gonna plant yourself
in front of as many TV cameras

35:31.630 --> 35:33.674
that can gather around
that bony ass of yours.

35:33.757 --> 35:36.592
You're gonna be wracked with guilt
and overcome with conscience.

35:36.677 --> 35:39.470
And you do that and I'll make sure
that you aren't charged.

35:40.221 --> 35:41.472
You want me to say it was Dunbar?

35:41.556 --> 35:44.559
Come on, be smarter than that, Oren.
She'll sue you for slander.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.145
Just say you were bought and
people will connect the dots on their own.

35:47.228 --> 35:50.065
Get him out of here.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.945
I hope you don't welsh on your promise
to me the way you did with Oren.

35:55.028 --> 35:59.615
You're family, Gene.
I would never betray one of the family.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.034
Shall we?

36:03.119 --> 36:04.412
Ready?

36:04.495 --> 36:07.040
<i>Many of you voted for me for mayor</i>

36:07.123 --> 36:10.418
<i>because you've known me your whole lives.</i>

36:10.501 --> 36:13.714
<i>Well, I've known Frank Underwood
my whole life.</i>

36:13.797 --> 36:16.632
He's my friend and I trust him,

36:16.717 --> 36:19.635
and I don't care what's on that billboard.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.013
I'm proud he's my president,

36:22.097 --> 36:25.225
and I'm proud to have...
be standing with him here today.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.819
Thank you, Gene.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.909
Yesterday, I stood in this church...

36:42.993 --> 36:45.787
and I talked about community.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.039
I talked about our collective strength,

36:48.123 --> 36:52.085
black and white,
coming together during times of crisis.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.256
And today there's probably a lot of you
who think I'm a hypocrite.

37:00.844 --> 37:07.475
How can a man whose father was in the KKK
stand up here and mean the things he said?

37:07.558 --> 37:11.437
Yes, that is my father in that photograph,
I'm not going to deny it.

37:11.521 --> 37:14.024
But the truth is he wasn't in the Klan.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.153
The year that photo was taken,

37:18.236 --> 37:23.283
my father needed $5,000
to pay off our debts,

37:23.366 --> 37:26.787
or the bank was gonna
foreclose on our farm.

37:27.871 --> 37:32.542
Now, my father went to every other bank
within a hundred miles of here,

37:32.625 --> 37:34.419
and no one would give him a loan.

37:34.502 --> 37:38.131
He asked friends, he asked family,
but nobody had that kind of money.

37:38.214 --> 37:40.842
And we were about to lose everything.

37:40.926 --> 37:45.513
Now, at the time,
the owner of the Gaffney First Bank

37:45.596 --> 37:46.973
was a member of the Klan.

37:47.057 --> 37:48.266
Some of you know that.

37:48.349 --> 37:52.520
And he would do whatever the Klan
told him to do, and my father knew that.

37:53.646 --> 37:55.816
So my father did what he had to do.

37:55.899 --> 37:59.444
<i>He went to a meeting
and begged the leader of that chapter</i>

37:59.527 --> 38:01.487
<i>to talk to the owner of the bank.</i>

38:01.571 --> 38:05.075
<i>And at that meeting,
that's when that photograph was taken.</i>

38:05.158 --> 38:09.412
<i>The only reason he was there
was to try to save our farm.</i>

38:10.831 --> 38:14.167
Now, Calvin Underwood
hated himself for going to that meeting.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.086
He hated himself
for taking that photograph.

38:16.169 --> 38:20.048
But he would've hated himself even more
if he'd lost our farm...

38:21.216 --> 38:25.136
if he hadn't been able to provide
and support his family.

38:25.220 --> 38:29.975
Now, look, I'm not trying to ask you
to forgive him being in that photograph.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.310
He probably thought
no one would ever see it.

38:33.311 --> 38:37.648
But I am asking you
to empathize with his predicament.

38:38.859 --> 38:40.568
And ask yourselves...

38:41.694 --> 38:44.614
what would you do to save your family?

38:44.697 --> 38:48.326
Now, whoever stole that photograph
and vandalized that billboard,

38:48.409 --> 38:51.371
they're not trying to unearth
some big scandal about my past,

38:51.454 --> 38:52.663
'cause it just isn't true.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.583
What they're trying to do is divide us.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.252
What they really wanna succeed in doing

38:57.335 --> 38:59.921
is making sure
you don't vote for me today.

39:01.882 --> 39:05.593
They've gone to a whole lot of trouble
to make me look pretty bad.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.470
But that's politics.

39:09.222 --> 39:11.807
My hope in coming here today...

39:12.808 --> 39:15.686
and speaking openly
and honestly about this...

39:16.855 --> 39:18.606
is that we can stay united.

39:19.607 --> 39:23.486
So my plan is to stay here
as long as it takes,

39:23.569 --> 39:26.239
to speak to each one of you individually,

39:26.322 --> 39:29.409
and answer every question
that you might have.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.912
Thank you very much.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.796
Thank you very much, ma'am.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.173
<i>President Underwood, speaking live</i>

39:43.256 --> 39:45.758
<i>in his home town of Gaffney,
South Carolina,</i>

39:45.841 --> 39:49.554
<i>addressing claims that his father
was a member of the Ku Klux Klan.</i>

39:49.637 --> 39:52.515
<i>A billboard there was vandalized
late last night</i>

39:52.598 --> 39:56.436
<i>with a photo of his father
standing next to a man in Klan robes</i>

39:56.519 --> 39:59.772
<i>with the caption, "Underwood 2016."</i>

39:59.855 --> 40:02.984
<i>As we've just seen,
the president did not deny allegations</i>

40:03.068 --> 40:05.987
<i>that his father had some connection
to the organization,</i>

40:06.071 --> 40:09.574
<i>instead explaining that Calvin Underwood
attended one meeting</i>

40:09.657 --> 40:13.703
<i>as a last resort to save
his family's peach farm from foreclosure.</i>

40:13.786 --> 40:16.957
<i>The president was subject
to widespread criticism</i>

40:17.040 --> 40:20.710
<i>after news of his family's alleged
Klan connection broke this morning.</i>

40:20.793 --> 40:23.213
<i>Today's primary result will show...</i>

40:23.296 --> 40:27.217
<i>I don't know her name.
I asked, but she wouldn't tell me.</i>

40:27.300 --> 40:29.427
<i>And I deeply regret that I allowed</i>

40:29.510 --> 40:33.932
<i>my political leanings
to compromise my better judgment.</i>

40:34.015 --> 40:37.560
<i>I want to apologize
to anyone I might have offended</i>

40:37.643 --> 40:41.606
<i>by hoisting up such painful imagery.</i>

40:41.689 --> 40:43.483
We're getting calls asking if it was us.

40:43.566 --> 40:46.527
- Do you think someone from our team...
- Absolutely not.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.030
I think Underwood put this guy up to it.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.324
He's trying to turn this
back around on us.

40:52.158 --> 40:54.369
We need to deny, forcefully.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.892
I'm already putting a press avail together
at your next event.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.126
Maybe we need to reconsider Goodwin.

41:02.668 --> 41:05.505
- What do you have in mind?
- I'm not sure.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.885
Mmm.

41:12.220 --> 41:13.679
Look at this.

41:19.852 --> 41:23.023
It came from the goddamn White House!

41:23.106 --> 41:24.482
We're questioning
the photographer now, sir.

41:24.565 --> 41:27.245
I've got a statement prepared
that this was a run-of-the-mill event,

41:27.318 --> 41:29.695
that you took photos
with lots of re-enactors.

41:29.779 --> 41:31.614
<i>It doesn't matter
how you spin it.</i>

41:31.697 --> 41:35.618
I just stood in front of a group
of African Americans in a church,

41:35.701 --> 41:37.037
asking them to believe in me.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.414
It's bad enough
they see my father next to a Klansman.

41:39.497 --> 41:42.125
Now they see me
next to a symbol of slavery.

41:42.208 --> 41:46.921
<i>I wanna find out who's leaking this shit,
and I want their head on a goddamn stake!</i>

41:50.425 --> 41:52.885
Sir, I have a theory.

41:54.720 --> 41:55.763
I think...

41:57.515 --> 41:59.934
Well, I think it might be Edward Meechum.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.020
<i>Meechum?</i>

42:02.103 --> 42:04.272
He knew about the argument
between you and the First Lady.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.107
<i>He was there on that trip to Virginia.</i>

42:06.191 --> 42:09.860
- He would never do something like this.
<i>- Dunbar has a lot of money.</i>

42:09.944 --> 42:11.344
Put out a statement to the networks

42:11.404 --> 42:13.239
that I won't be giving
a concession speech.

42:13.323 --> 42:15.658
Sir... don't you think that might
look like you're running from...

42:15.741 --> 42:19.495
I just lost my home state.
I'm not gonna rake myself over the coals.

42:26.127 --> 42:27.170
Meechum?

42:28.171 --> 42:30.256
I'm not ruling anyone out.

42:38.806 --> 42:39.890
Sir?

42:45.230 --> 42:47.022
I brought the safety deposit box for you.

42:47.107 --> 42:48.858
You can put it down.

42:51.611 --> 42:53.654
- Meechum.
- Yes, sir?

42:54.655 --> 42:57.408
Have I given you any reason to hurt me?

42:58.033 --> 42:59.160
Hurt you, sir?

43:00.078 --> 43:03.248
Have I done you wrong in any way?

43:03.331 --> 43:05.833
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.

43:15.718 --> 43:17.303
Look me in the eyes, Meechum.

43:17.387 --> 43:19.555
- Sir...
- Meechum, shh.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.291
Are you all right, sir?

43:46.374 --> 43:48.000
I've been better.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.713
I'm still on duty.

44:06.018 --> 44:07.770
Is there...

44:07.853 --> 44:09.439
anything I can do?

44:09.522 --> 44:12.483
You could go out
and stuff some ballot boxes for me.

44:13.693 --> 44:17.029
- You'll bounce back from this.
- I sure hope I can.

44:21.284 --> 44:23.494
Uh, when I got fired...

44:23.578 --> 44:25.913
from the Capitol Police...

44:25.996 --> 44:28.541
I mean, I know it doesn't compare, but...

44:29.667 --> 44:31.211
I felt pretty bad.

44:32.127 --> 44:34.339
I thought my career was over.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.342
Then you turned everything around.

44:40.595 --> 44:42.680
You don't get second chances in elections.

44:42.763 --> 44:43.806
I know.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.976
But there's a lot of primaries ahead.

44:47.893 --> 44:51.731
All I'm saying is it's not over.
You'll get through this.

44:53.858 --> 44:58.238
- I'm sorry, that must sound so stupid.
- No, it doesn't.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.865
I appreciate it.

45:07.413 --> 45:10.791
I'll be out by the motorcade, sir,
if you need anything.

45:11.667 --> 45:13.378
Thank you, Meechum.

46:17.274 --> 46:20.069
I knew it, but I didn't wanna believe it.

46:46.095 --> 46:47.555
It's only a wound.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.223
It's not fatal.

46:49.306 --> 46:51.934
My home state, Claire.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.019
Have a seat.

46:54.103 --> 46:55.563
I end your race so you end mine?

46:55.646 --> 46:58.315
- Let me explain, Francis.
- Spite, revenge!

46:58.399 --> 47:00.943
Please, sit down.
We need to talk.

47:03.070 --> 47:06.491
Nothing is going to come
from anger right now.

47:25.092 --> 47:29.013
Last night when we were talking,
you called this house a palace.

47:29.764 --> 47:31.641
This is where we began.

47:32.558 --> 47:35.102
And do you remember
when my mother almost left Daddy

47:35.185 --> 47:37.730
because he funded your campaign?

47:37.813 --> 47:40.400
That's how much she hated you.

47:40.483 --> 47:41.734
But I didn't care,

47:41.817 --> 47:44.236
because I saw something.
I saw a future.

47:44.779 --> 47:46.406
Our future.

47:46.489 --> 47:49.492
We had a future
until you started destroying it.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.661
Well, you wouldn't have
listened otherwise.

47:51.744 --> 47:53.871
I always listen to you.

47:54.622 --> 47:57.041
Only when it's what you want to hear.

47:57.875 --> 48:01.671
Well, all right, Claire.
I'm listening now.

48:01.754 --> 48:05.090
What is it you so desperately
needed to say?

48:05.174 --> 48:10.345
We've never lost a race in 30 years.
We started here and we've always won.

48:10.430 --> 48:11.931
You and I, together.

48:12.807 --> 48:14.892
But you are losing, Francis.

48:14.975 --> 48:17.269
People are getting killed
at the gas pumps.

48:18.270 --> 48:20.731
America Works is falling flat.

48:20.815 --> 48:24.652
Your campaign manager
is ten years behind ten years ago.

48:25.653 --> 48:27.362
You don't have a viable running mate.

48:27.447 --> 48:29.281
We both know it can't be Donald Blythe.

48:30.074 --> 48:31.492
Well, of course not.

48:31.576 --> 48:35.120
But I have to win the goddamn nomination
before I can start worrying about winning.

48:35.204 --> 48:38.499
Even if I hadn't done what I did,
your race is in real trouble.

48:39.291 --> 48:40.751
You need me, Francis.

48:41.669 --> 48:43.963
My approvals are higher than yours.

48:44.046 --> 48:45.965
I can help you win Texas.

48:46.048 --> 48:48.968
Exactly. Which is why
I didn't want you running in Dallas.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.553
I need you at my side.

48:50.636 --> 48:52.888
Yes, but in a different way.

48:52.972 --> 48:54.849
Different how?

48:55.766 --> 48:58.102
We make each other stronger,
can we agree to that?

48:59.269 --> 49:01.814
When it's working,
but it's not working.

49:01.897 --> 49:03.440
We can make it work.

49:04.316 --> 49:08.696
We can accomplish that future
I saw when we first got married.

49:09.614 --> 49:13.158
It was us, as partners, real partners.

49:13.909 --> 49:16.245
Let's run together, again.

49:16.328 --> 49:18.372
Not just as husband and wife.

49:26.171 --> 49:27.214
You don't mean...

49:28.048 --> 49:29.133
Yes.

49:32.928 --> 49:34.805
I'm worried about you, Claire.

49:37.224 --> 49:39.977
You're not making any sense.
You've let your ego get in the way...

49:40.060 --> 49:41.896
I've always been your running mate.

49:41.979 --> 49:44.732
- You just didn't wanna see it.
- As my vice president?

49:44.815 --> 49:47.401
- Jesus. Do you have any idea...
- I've put a lot of thought into this.

49:47.484 --> 49:48.485
You can't have thought it through.

49:48.569 --> 49:51.947
- You'd come up with a million reasons...
- She's never run for anything.

49:52.031 --> 49:55.367
No children, nepotism, arrogance,
I've run through them all.

49:57.703 --> 49:59.622
You can't win without me.

50:01.999 --> 50:05.878
I would rather have a spineless
Donald Blythe as my vice president

50:05.961 --> 50:08.631
than a woman
who's never held elected office.

50:09.464 --> 50:13.052
You're losing to a woman
who's never held elected office.

50:14.469 --> 50:16.513
You don't deserve it.

50:16.597 --> 50:21.143
You have no idea
what it means to have nothing.

50:21.226 --> 50:24.605
You don't value what we have achieved.

50:25.606 --> 50:29.359
I have had to fight for everything
my entire life.

50:34.531 --> 50:35.950
Do you know why I kept this?

50:36.992 --> 50:38.327
Do you know?

50:38.410 --> 50:42.915
Because it's the one time
I was proud of my father.

50:42.998 --> 50:47.294
Because this man, in this moment,
as despicable as it was,

50:47.377 --> 50:49.046
is fighting to survive.

50:50.172 --> 50:53.593
He is doing whatever it took.

50:53.676 --> 50:56.470
And so will I, with or without you.

50:56.553 --> 51:01.016
So no, I will not have this conversation.
I will not indulge you any further.

51:01.100 --> 51:03.352
You have to let this go.

51:03.435 --> 51:06.772
I can be a part of your campaign,
or I can end it.

51:09.066 --> 51:12.111
I'll do whatever it takes, too.
Just like your father.

51:13.112 --> 51:15.239
But I will not let this go.

51:24.498 --> 51:26.917
I'll need a car to the Greenville Airport.

51:27.835 --> 51:29.544
To Dallas, yes.

51:30.305 --> 51:36.398
