<i>Okay, so last time
you all saw Star...</i>

00:02.475 --> 00:03.765
Stay away from Simone.

00:03.772 --> 00:05.421
You don't know a damn
thing about that girl.

00:05.427 --> 00:08.200
Ms. Carlotta's not gonna like
that you have custody over me.

00:08.206 --> 00:10.821
- Hi, Dad.
- I've seen the quarterly reports.

00:10.827 --> 00:12.715
- I thought I had a year.
- I want to know Star

00:12.721 --> 00:14.677
- won't get hurt by this.
- Just get the pictures

00:14.683 --> 00:16.440
off her damn phone.

00:16.447 --> 00:18.130
I told you we were done.

00:18.137 --> 00:20.210
You ain't never gonna be
able to leave me, girl.

00:20.217 --> 00:22.503
<i>Hey, doll. It's Arlene.
They know about</i>

00:22.509 --> 00:24.444
<i>those girls you set free.
They're coming for you.</i>

00:24.451 --> 00:28.164
Noah Brooks, you're going to close
the showcase, with Alex in a duet.

00:28.171 --> 00:30.027
<i>Finally, we can stop
with all the stunts.</i>

00:30.034 --> 00:32.452
You don't got to do that fake
relationship with Noah anymore.

00:32.459 --> 00:34.275
I never got a chance to
thank you for earlier.

00:34.282 --> 00:36.287

What you doing,
creeping so early?

02:45.236 --> 02:48.240
What are you even doing up this early?
It's the crack of dawn.

02:48.250 --> 02:52.210
We got a radio promo.
For the competition.

02:52.216 --> 02:54.915
You know I'm not letting anybody
else take that mic, right?

02:57.544 --> 02:58.994
Cott, what is that?

03:00.815 --> 03:02.946
- What?
- What is that?

03:04.090 --> 03:05.951
- Did Elliot hit you?
- No.

03:05.961 --> 03:08.505
Cotton, you better tell me the truth.
You know I've been through this.

03:08.515 --> 03:10.981
I will kill him, so you're gonna have
to explain to me what's going on.

03:10.991 --> 03:15.466
Just... Just sit. Just sit. And be quiet.
It's not what you think.

03:15.472 --> 03:18.020
So I met this dude in jail,

03:18.030 --> 03:22.568
and he just got out
and we go hard.

03:23.708 --> 03:25.364
Oh.

03:25.374 --> 03:27.847
Oh, you kinky little bitch.

03:28.388 --> 03:31.134
Oh, my God. So what is it like?
Is it dangerous?

03:31.144 --> 03:34.033
I mean, it's rough, but it's
nothing I can't handle.

03:34.043 --> 03:35.889
But you got a prison bae.

03:36.348 --> 03:38.131
So now, what about Elliot?

03:38.141 --> 03:42.233
I love Elliot. But Omari...

03:43.025 --> 03:45.041
Spanks you.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.800
- I get it.
- I just can't say no.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.079
I don't need no more details.
Don't tell me nothing else.

03:49.427 --> 03:52.031
- Hard, hard, hard.
- Oka...

03:55.498 --> 03:58.428
The fans are gonna get to
choose who wins this showcase.

03:58.442 --> 04:01.172
So the competition starts
with this radio gig.

04:01.178 --> 04:04.408
Which means, whatever beef y'all
got going on between you two,

04:04.414 --> 04:06.644
you need to dead that right now.

04:06.650 --> 04:09.001
I really didn't know Ayanna
would choose me and Noah

04:09.008 --> 04:10.348
to close the showcase.

04:10.354 --> 04:12.286
And I'm really not upset.

04:12.293 --> 04:14.685
As long as Take Three wins, and
we get Simone out of there.

04:14.692 --> 04:15.878
I don't care.

04:15.885 --> 04:17.949
Well, that means drumming
up a lot of votes, ladies.

04:17.956 --> 04:19.089
Lots of 'em.

04:19.095 --> 04:22.526
Now, any chance you
get to talk, take it.

04:22.532 --> 04:25.028
You need to make these people
who are gonna vote love you.

04:25.034 --> 04:27.165
- All right. -We got it.
- Hey, Star.

04:27.171 --> 04:28.499
I need to talk to you.

04:28.505 --> 04:31.468
I know it's early.

04:31.474 --> 04:33.392
Yeah, too damn early for
you to be here, Brody.

04:33.399 --> 04:34.800
It's all good, Carlotta.

04:35.645 --> 04:37.541
I'll be right there.

04:37.547 --> 04:39.209
What do you want?

04:39.215 --> 04:41.014
I couldn't sleep last
night, all right?

04:41.021 --> 04:43.374
I found out about this Hunter guy.
And what he did to you.

04:43.381 --> 04:44.848
How do you know about that?

04:44.854 --> 04:46.684
You know what, don't even tell
me how you know about it.

04:46.690 --> 04:48.250
Because I've let go of it, you
go ahead and do that, too.

04:48.257 --> 04:49.687
Listen to me.

04:49.693 --> 04:51.288
I came here for you and Simone,

04:51.294 --> 04:52.990
and I'm not going anywhere.

04:52.996 --> 04:54.791
Do you understand? I love you.

04:54.797 --> 04:56.867
Okay. I got it. I got it.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.757
What are you doing
in Ayanna's car?

05:26.763 --> 05:28.358
She got me out of juvie.

05:28.364 --> 05:29.860
I'm living with her now.

What?

She got me out two weeks ago.

Baby, I know we desperate,
but that ain't the way.

05:40.032 --> 05:41.410
I was rotting in there.

05:41.416 --> 05:44.114
Being told when to eat
and when to sleep.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.224
I had girls killing
themselves in front of me.

05:46.231 --> 05:48.700
Simone, we have a plan.

Really? What happens

05:53.282 --> 05:54.374
What happens to me?

05:54.381 --> 05:56.561
That's the point of the plan, Simone.
We will win.

05:56.568 --> 05:59.680
- We're doing everything that we can.
- You think that I want this?

05:59.687 --> 06:01.279
I mean, she did what
y'all couldn't do.

06:01.286 --> 06:03.248
Everything about this is shady.

06:03.838 --> 06:05.167
I told her to stay
away from you,

06:05.173 --> 06:06.368
and she went behind my back.

06:06.374 --> 06:09.037
Yeah, well, it's done.

06:09.043 --> 06:12.714
Don't we got an interview
to do or something?

06:18.586 --> 06:21.355
This morning, we got some very
special guests in the house.

06:21.362 --> 06:23.457
"Y'all say what's up to the “A."

06:25.660 --> 06:27.690
Happy to be here.
Happy to be here.

06:27.696 --> 06:31.294
So Midtown Sound got that
fire coming out the gate,

06:31.300 --> 06:32.739
showcasing its top
talent, ya dig.

06:32.746 --> 06:34.749
But what they doing is
letting the fans decide

06:34.756 --> 06:36.820
which new artist is
gonna win that prize.

06:36.827 --> 06:38.989
Now, Midtown's streaming
this show live,

06:38.996 --> 06:40.748
and the fans vote on
social media, right?

06:40.755 --> 06:41.938
- That's right.
- Yeah.

06:41.945 --> 06:44.140
And when the fans vote for
Take Three and we win,

06:44.147 --> 06:45.837
that means we get the
album, the tour,

06:45.844 --> 06:47.355
and all that Midtown coin.

06:47.361 --> 06:49.524
- And we'll be priority at the label.
- Yes.

06:49.530 --> 06:51.360
And by the looks at this table,
it's not gonna be that hard.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.551
I think we got it in the bag.

06:52.558 --> 06:55.888
Right, well, that bag is fake.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.100
- My name is Andy.
- And I'm Angel.

06:58.107 --> 06:59.842
- Yeah...
- And if I recall,

06:59.849 --> 07:01.836
you didn't win Atlanta NextFest.

07:01.842 --> 07:04.340
- Take Three did, right?
- Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

07:04.346 --> 07:06.542
- All right. All right.
- Okay, all right.

07:06.549 --> 07:08.768
All right. Well, I'm seeing
some real live competition

07:08.775 --> 07:11.214
- up in here.
- Oh, no. The competition is very real.

07:11.221 --> 07:13.505
Me and my sister have been
dreaming about making an album

07:13.512 --> 07:14.783
- since we were little girls.
- Keep dreaming.

07:14.789 --> 07:17.752
There's no way we're letting
anybody at this table

07:17.758 --> 07:19.724
- take that away. -That's right.
- And I want everybody

07:19.731 --> 07:22.358
to finally see me. Not my father.
Not my name.

07:22.364 --> 07:24.593
But my talent, my sound.

07:24.599 --> 07:26.761
- And if we win...
- Which you won't, 'cause, uh,

07:26.767 --> 07:28.764
we're here. When we win,
I'm, uh, I'm-a shout out

07:28.770 --> 07:30.298
all the people that hated on me.

07:30.304 --> 07:33.602
You know, all the big time haters out...
out there at Buckhead High.

07:33.608 --> 07:35.710
My pops always called
me a waste of space.

07:35.717 --> 07:37.988
And if I win, he can't
do that anymore, so...

07:37.995 --> 07:39.674
- But you got to win, though.
- Oh, I will.

07:39.681 --> 07:41.293
And you won't, not
while I'm here.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.843
What, Noah Brooks is in the house.
Now listen,

07:43.850 --> 07:45.323
- my money's on you.
- Yeah.

07:45.330 --> 07:48.146
Even though you almost pissed the
ladies off last week with that Becky.

07:48.153 --> 07:50.551
Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's
all good, though.

07:50.558 --> 07:52.749
Ain't nobody for me
but my baby Alex.

07:52.756 --> 07:54.989
How does it feel being in
this showcase with artists

07:54.996 --> 07:56.833
who haven't even
recorded an album?

07:56.857 --> 07:59.010
I mean, I just think it's
cute, you know? It's fun.

07:59.016 --> 08:01.513
Um, you know, I-I want
to inspire the children.

08:01.519 --> 08:03.914
Well, with your girl by your side.
Now, I hear you and Alex

08:03.920 --> 08:06.306
are gonna close that joint out
with a little performance.

08:06.313 --> 08:07.619
Oh, yeah, it's gonna be fire.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.821
- Uh, y'all official, right?
- Oh, yeah.

08:09.827 --> 08:11.625
We-We, you know, we're
definitely official.

08:11.632 --> 08:13.266
- Okay.
- Absolutely.

08:13.273 --> 08:14.458
Super official.

08:14.464 --> 08:16.661
- Okay, well, check this out.
- Thank you.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.930
My man Hurricane Dave
said Midtown sent over

08:18.936 --> 08:21.700
a little surprise.
So, uh, Atlanta,

08:21.706 --> 08:24.034
you are hearing it for
the first time ever.

08:24.040 --> 08:27.439
- It's a Hot 107.9 radio exclusive.
- Yeah!

08:27.445 --> 08:29.641
And this is gonna be, uh,
closing down the showcase.

08:29.647 --> 08:31.975
- Here it is, y'all. “So
Sick.” - "So Sick."

08:31.981 --> 08:34.956
- Yes.
- Wait. You're dropping our song?

08:34.962 --> 08:37.025
Ayanna Floyd told us
to surprise y'all.

08:37.032 --> 08:40.518
Yup. And this is written and
produced by the two love baes.

08:40.524 --> 08:42.341
Noah Brooks and Alexandra Crane.

08:42.347 --> 08:45.290
Alexandra Crane of Take Three.

08:45.296 --> 08:47.691
Who's gonna win the showcase.
Thank you, Atlanta.

08:47.697 --> 08:49.661
- You're welcome.
- Mm-hmm.

08:51.483 --> 08:53.531
What? That got weird,
but thank you all.

08:53.537 --> 08:56.234
Dropping the single right
before the show, smart PR.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.306
This show has to set
Atlanta on fire,

08:58.313 --> 09:00.426
- or my father is going to make changes.
- Like what?

09:00.433 --> 09:02.974
You have any idea what you're
doing to that girl's head?

09:02.980 --> 09:05.810
Oh, God. Could you be
more specific, Carlotta?

09:08.052 --> 09:10.181
You had no right
to take Simone in.

09:10.187 --> 09:13.084
You making moves you
not qualified to make.

09:13.090 --> 09:15.052
That's ironic, since your past

09:15.058 --> 09:16.821
is the reason Simone
is at my house.

09:16.827 --> 09:18.922
You don't know nothing
about my past.

09:18.928 --> 09:22.494
Oh, please, it's public
record at the county courts.

09:22.500 --> 09:25.062
And who puts a painting of Kathy
Griffin on their office wall?

09:25.068 --> 09:27.065
Kathy's a friend. And
I seriously doubt

09:27.071 --> 09:30.100
you know the artist I
commissioned to do it.

09:30.106 --> 09:33.037
It's called taste, Carlotta.
Something you have none of.

09:33.043 --> 09:36.007
You need to learn it if you're
going to manage these artists.

09:36.013 --> 09:38.008
You can start with
your ensembles.

09:38.014 --> 09:40.744
Who has my latte?!

09:40.750 --> 09:42.409
Look, I know how you
feel right now.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.014
What is she trying
to pull with Simone?

09:44.020 --> 09:45.849
Baby, she just gave
her a place to stay.

09:45.855 --> 09:48.186
You're letting whatever
guilt you feel about Mary

09:48.192 --> 09:50.455
and Simone bleed together.
Stop overreacting.

09:50.461 --> 09:51.790
This is my family.

09:51.796 --> 09:53.758
My life.

09:53.764 --> 09:55.560
And she did this behind my back.

09:55.566 --> 09:57.961
You know what?

09:57.967 --> 09:59.730
Don't weigh in on my
family like this.

09:59.736 --> 10:01.872
The sex wasn't that good.

10:10.447 --> 10:11.909
You happy?

10:11.915 --> 10:14.612
It sounded great on the radio.

10:14.618 --> 10:16.815
You want me to be sad about
what happened? I'm not.

10:16.821 --> 10:18.876
This is supposed to
be us right now.

10:18.883 --> 10:20.984
We're supposed to be hearing
our song on the radio

10:20.990 --> 10:22.753
for the first time, but
it's you and Noah.

10:22.759 --> 10:24.755
And he's doing this
for his career,

10:24.761 --> 10:26.830
that's not even
gonna include you.

10:29.133 --> 10:31.763
It's crazy, right?

10:31.769 --> 10:33.837
Ayanna just dropped
the single like that.

10:33.844 --> 10:36.133
- Did you know?
- You ain't never been on the radio,

10:36.139 --> 10:38.402
and you pissed right now.
Are you serious?

10:38.408 --> 10:41.004
Because this is not
supposed to be with you.

10:41.010 --> 10:43.475
- I have a group and Derek and...
- Derek?

10:43.482 --> 10:45.643
- What does this have to do with Derek?
- Everything.

10:45.649 --> 10:47.744
- You kissed me.
- You kissed me back.

10:47.750 --> 10:49.980
Okay, now you're trippin'.

10:49.986 --> 10:52.417
I don't want to do this
duet thing with you.

10:52.423 --> 10:54.859
Nor do I want to be in a
fake relationship, either.

11:00.147 --> 11:01.999
So I heard you on the
show this morning.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.659
Yeah, how are we
supposed to compete?

11:04.666 --> 11:06.196
Noah's set for a comeback.

11:06.202 --> 11:08.178
And the girls won
Atlanta's NextFest,

11:08.185 --> 11:10.432
so we're obviously nobody
in this situation.

11:10.439 --> 11:13.561
We ain't nobodies, okay?
But we are the underdogs.

11:13.568 --> 11:14.939
We just got to be smart.

11:14.946 --> 11:16.943
I mean, Noah... he used
to be the king, right?

11:16.950 --> 11:19.242
But now, he's in there
scrapping with y'all.

11:19.249 --> 11:21.345
You don't think that
messes with his ego?

11:21.352 --> 11:24.065
So, that's what we do.
You mess with his head.

11:24.072 --> 11:25.801
Mess with <i> all</i> their heads.

11:26.266 --> 11:28.817
Okay, well, I'm-a get at
those girls from Take Three.

11:28.824 --> 11:31.053
You know, make them fall in
love with this Latin lover.

11:31.060 --> 11:32.521
Bro, you're barely Spanish.

11:32.528 --> 11:34.335
Don't nobody want that
little dirty chalupa.

11:34.342 --> 11:36.125
- Can we keep going?
- Latino light.

11:36.131 --> 11:37.559
The reality is
your show was hot.

11:37.565 --> 11:39.265
Okay? We just got
to come up with...

11:39.272 --> 11:41.374
I don't know... something
that surprises the viewers.

11:41.381 --> 11:43.032
Okay, well, I've seen the books,

11:43.039 --> 11:45.570
and there is nothing in the budget
for us to do anything extra.

11:45.577 --> 11:48.200
You get the music right...
I'll get the money.

11:50.767 --> 11:53.055
Who the hell do you
think you are?

11:53.983 --> 11:56.045
Your sister had been languishing
in hell for months,

11:56.052 --> 11:57.645
and I gave her a lifeline.

11:59.953 --> 12:02.771
Ayanna... stay away
from my sister.

12:02.778 --> 12:04.976
Don't you dare threaten me.

12:04.982 --> 12:08.084
Go in there and do your job.

12:15.578 --> 12:17.007
Please stop.

12:17.014 --> 12:18.850
- If you hadn't have done this...
- All right.

12:18.857 --> 12:20.424
- Let's see it.
- Okay.

12:20.430 --> 12:21.592
Yo, Noah, come on, man.

13:04.007 --> 13:06.703
You have a showcase in a week,
and you're supposed to be

13:06.709 --> 13:09.707
the baddest on my label.
You have a full

13:09.713 --> 13:12.275
dress rehearsal tomorrow.

13:12.281 --> 13:14.285
Maurice, this is
an embarrassment.

13:23.730 --> 13:24.899
Jahil...

13:26.962 --> 13:28.173
Hey, Brody.

13:30.053 --> 13:31.417
We need to talk.

13:32.698 --> 13:34.799
So what you want, man?

13:35.391 --> 13:36.838
Talk about old times?

13:37.285 --> 13:41.183
No. Arlene Morgan and
her coward-ass son.

13:41.189 --> 13:43.086
What about 'em?

13:43.197 --> 13:44.425
You knew.

13:44.432 --> 13:47.763
Look, man, I had no idea what
Hunter was doing to Star

13:47.770 --> 13:49.127
up until the night that he died.

13:49.134 --> 13:51.571
Star never told nobody.

13:51.578 --> 13:53.597
And as far as Arlene is
concerned, she's dirt.

13:53.604 --> 13:55.066
Tried to set me up to be killed,

13:55.073 --> 13:56.624
so I got no love
lost for that bitch.

13:56.631 --> 13:58.267
Anyway, what do you
care about Star

13:58.274 --> 13:59.950
and her well-being at
this point anyway?

13:59.957 --> 14:02.570
That boy hurt her the same
way you used to hurt Mary.

14:02.577 --> 14:04.789
Hey, I never laid a hand on
Mary, and you know that.

14:04.796 --> 14:06.227
Look, let's cut to
the chase, man.

14:06.234 --> 14:08.131
All right, what's this
got to do with Arlene?

14:09.600 --> 14:10.835
Well, she found me.

14:10.842 --> 14:12.636
Found out I had debts.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.254
Some big ones, in Vegas.

14:15.261 --> 14:17.711
- So that's where you've been.
- She wanted me to get

14:17.718 --> 14:19.181
some info on Star's phone.

14:19.188 --> 14:21.083
Said she'd give me 250 grand.

14:21.181 --> 14:23.946
Don't judge me, Jahil.

14:24.145 --> 14:25.793
I needed the money.

14:27.013 --> 14:28.226
You and me...

14:28.741 --> 14:31.166
we're both cut from the
same cloth, brother.

14:32.402 --> 14:33.591
I need your help.

14:34.631 --> 14:36.634
You want something to drink?

14:48.270 --> 14:49.348
Ayanna.

14:49.370 --> 14:51.541
- Yes, Crane?
- I...

14:53.142 --> 14:55.937
I don't think closing the
showcase is good for me or Noah,

14:55.944 --> 14:56.987
and on top of that,

14:56.994 --> 14:59.058
- it's confusing for Midtown.
- Don't tell me

14:59.065 --> 15:00.741
what's confusing for my company.

15:00.747 --> 15:02.439
I pay you to sing.

15:02.446 --> 15:04.211
- That's all.
- I get it.

15:04.218 --> 15:05.678
I was just thinking, if...

15:05.685 --> 15:08.149
I'm not paying you to think.
You two came up

15:08.155 --> 15:10.640
with the idea of a
relationship and a love song.

15:10.647 --> 15:13.254
I, then, went to
the radio with it.

15:13.261 --> 15:15.368
- Now, you want out.
- Yes. But only because...

15:15.375 --> 15:16.844
You're falling for
him, aren't you?

15:19.639 --> 15:21.897
I thought you were smarter
than that, Crane.

15:22.999 --> 15:25.168
The duet stays.

15:44.153 --> 15:46.557
Show prep ain't no joke.

15:48.461 --> 15:51.091
You want to rehearse?
Just you and me?

15:51.699 --> 15:55.429
Um, mm, no, I-I got to rehearse
my own thing, but thanks.

15:55.688 --> 15:57.858
Ah. Okay. Okay.

15:59.684 --> 16:00.941
Hey.

16:02.203 --> 16:04.372
Why do you want to sing?

16:10.050 --> 16:12.246
Takes away the painful thoughts.

16:12.452 --> 16:13.897
Makes me forget.

16:14.988 --> 16:16.458
What about you?

16:18.425 --> 16:20.561
Me, too.

16:24.647 --> 16:26.320
How about I count us in?

16:26.800 --> 16:27.996
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16:28.002 --> 16:29.155
Let's do it.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.601
- Do you know the steps?
- Kind of.

16:33.607 --> 16:34.836
I know. Me, too,

16:34.842 --> 16:36.761
- but I know this one part, so, okay.
- Okay.

16:36.768 --> 16:38.612
- Want to start from this part?
- That's perfect.

Don't try to act
like we cool now.

17:06.892 --> 17:08.484
Noah, what are you
talking about, man?

17:08.492 --> 17:09.839
I'm just showing you some love.

17:09.846 --> 17:12.443
I get it. My bad. I understand.

17:12.646 --> 17:14.275
Your brother just died.

17:14.281 --> 17:15.944
Hey, man, don't speak

17:15.950 --> 17:18.876

- Well, you got a good time,

17:24.419 --> 17:26.482
- and boy, you about to get clocked.
- Yeah? Don't forget.

17:26.489 --> 17:29.001
I know you. That's how you
lost your deal the first time.

17:29.008 --> 17:31.871
And to think I was almost about
to feel bad for your ass.

17:32.399 --> 17:34.661
But now, I'm gonna have
to mop your ungrateful,

17:34.667 --> 17:36.649
drunk behind all
over that floor.

17:36.656 --> 17:37.899
Oh, you sound funny right now.

17:37.905 --> 17:41.135
You should go fetch me some water.
You better know your place,<i> boy.</i>

17:41.141 --> 17:42.836
You know what place I'm in?

17:42.842 --> 17:44.973
The same place you are.

17:44.979 --> 17:47.342
You ain't noticed that?

17:47.348 --> 17:50.844
Last year, you had everything.

17:50.850 --> 17:53.988
So I know that that Lucky
thing ain't got you shook.

17:56.656 --> 17:58.893
You're afraid of
the competition.

18:00.727 --> 18:04.016
See, one thing I learned
from working with Ayanna...

18:04.500 --> 18:06.167
I can smell a bitch.

18:24.069 --> 18:25.662
You got balls coming in here.

18:27.506 --> 18:29.435
So you tried to have
me killed, huh?

18:36.181 --> 18:37.331
So...

18:37.883 --> 18:39.228
how's Brody?

18:41.063 --> 18:42.265
I got him in my pocket.

18:42.272 --> 18:43.507
Oh, do ya?

18:44.054 --> 18:45.339
That's funny.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.463
Hmm.

18:47.781 --> 18:49.589
Maybe that's why he's
out trying to sell

18:49.596 --> 18:52.092
pictures of your son beating
the crap out of Star.

18:53.544 --> 18:55.183
See, I figured you should know,

18:55.946 --> 18:58.494
because without the foundation,
you ain't got no money.

18:58.501 --> 19:00.828
You got as much money as I do.

19:06.734 --> 19:08.328
Where is he?

19:08.334 --> 19:09.486
Brody?

19:09.690 --> 19:11.759
He had a little run-in
with my nine millimeter.

19:15.974 --> 19:18.137
I'll tell you what, though.
You pay me,

19:18.144 --> 19:20.239
and I'll give you the phone
with everything on it,

19:20.246 --> 19:22.242
and I'll even take
care of Brody.

19:27.085 --> 19:28.994
I got the goods, Arlene.

19:30.251 --> 19:32.281
Baby, I'm... I'm so sorry.

19:32.288 --> 19:34.436
Come on, please call me back.

19:34.443 --> 19:36.810
I don't know what came over me.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

19:36.817 --> 19:38.266
I miss him, too.

19:38.273 --> 19:41.465
You can have him back for 500 K.

19:42.004 --> 19:44.083
The foundation ain't
gonna miss it.

19:47.059 --> 19:48.403
Meet me tomorrow.

19:49.662 --> 19:51.096
I'll get it.

19:52.487 --> 19:54.489
Now, get the hell out of here.

20:15.296 --> 20:16.797
How you doing, baby?

20:17.583 --> 20:18.867
I'm cool.

20:19.811 --> 20:20.910
Why you ain't tell me?

20:21.478 --> 20:23.448
Because I knew you'd
think what you think.

20:23.455 --> 20:24.577
And what am I thinkin'?

20:24.584 --> 20:26.391
That I'm not thinking
things through.

20:26.398 --> 20:29.228
That I'm doing things out of
desperation just like my mom.

20:29.234 --> 20:31.631
Like Mary, but that
ain't the truth.

20:32.536 --> 20:34.379
You just don't listen
to me, Miss C.

20:34.386 --> 20:36.093
I've been listening.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.555
I don't do nothing <i> but</i> listen.

20:37.562 --> 20:39.171
Really? Then you
must not hear me.

20:39.177 --> 20:41.079
I was dying in there.
I would sign out

20:41.086 --> 20:43.476
and come here, and nobody
would ask me anything.

20:43.482 --> 20:46.246
Nobody knew how messed
up my life was in there.

20:47.034 --> 20:50.358
And then when I lost
Karen, I just...

20:51.338 --> 20:53.028
She meant a lot to you, huh?

20:53.035 --> 20:56.061
Yeah. I think I loved her.

20:57.777 --> 20:59.830
Simone, are you high right now?

21:00.082 --> 21:02.017
I'm not talking about no pot.
What are you on?

21:05.268 --> 21:06.764
Oh, I'm gonna get my answer.

21:07.676 --> 21:08.869
Come on.

21:08.876 --> 21:10.963
Well, I mean, these don't
do the closets any justice.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.300
This is gorgeous.
Whose house is this?

21:13.307 --> 21:15.637
- I-I mean, I love...
- Where's my check?

21:16.630 --> 21:18.058
Look, I already mailed it.

21:18.064 --> 21:19.393
It didn't come.

21:19.399 --> 21:20.822
I want it now.

21:20.829 --> 21:22.799
- Get out of my office.
- Stop playing with me,

21:22.806 --> 21:25.206
- China man. I want my damn money.
- You know what?

21:25.213 --> 21:27.347
- I'm sick of your redneck ass.
- Get off! -Hey, hey.

21:27.354 --> 21:30.151
You want problems? Get...
I'm gonna kill your ass.

21:39.991 --> 21:43.042
Wow, you sure do know how to
take care of a man, don't you?

21:45.720 --> 21:46.880
That house?

21:47.565 --> 21:49.327
That's our house.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.858
- What?
- Those plans are for our house.

21:52.865 --> 21:54.694
Elliot, wait, wait.

21:54.700 --> 21:57.049
No, look, look, look.
I love you.

21:57.056 --> 21:59.316
I want everything for us.
A marriage.

21:59.323 --> 22:02.323
A life. That's why I'm
showing you those plans.

22:03.590 --> 22:06.439
I'm asking what you
think I'm asking.

22:09.624 --> 22:11.233
Why are you doing this to me?

22:11.788 --> 22:14.389
'Cause I give a damn about you.

22:15.596 --> 22:18.130
Oh, so you just happen to
have a pee test lying around?

22:18.137 --> 22:20.553
I'm a ex-convict. I got
discounts on pee tests.

22:20.560 --> 22:22.814
- Yeah, well, you're crazy if you...
- Sit your ass down.

22:22.821 --> 22:24.864
You're crazy if you think that
I'm actually gonna sit...

22:24.871 --> 22:26.751
No, you're crazy if you
think I'm-a let you out

22:26.758 --> 22:28.728
- in these streets with no check-in.
- Okay, fine.

22:28.735 --> 22:31.277
- Well, I'll pee when you leave.
- No, you gonna pee right here,

22:31.284 --> 22:32.642
right now. Go.

22:35.289 --> 22:36.590
Nice.

22:48.146 --> 22:50.483
Simone, we so close
to this showcase.

22:50.943 --> 22:52.320
Learn from your
mother's mistakes.

22:52.327 --> 22:53.631
Think about your future.

23:06.340 --> 23:08.909
- Miss C, I really d...
- Negative.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.955

past through us.

23:16.757 --> 23:18.336

If Charles Floyd

31:41.429 --> 31:43.738

- Andy, shut up.

31:46.132 --> 31:47.738

to shine and get that album,

32:04.151 --> 32:05.839
but if we're supposed
to open up the show

32:05.845 --> 32:06.974
and let them know
that Midtown is here,

32:06.980 --> 32:08.641
then we got to make
sure that song is hot.

32:08.647 --> 32:12.478
We're all survivors. We're all here
because somebody didn't have our back

32:12.484 --> 32:13.786
or didn't believe in us.

32:15.689 --> 32:17.417
So we need this.

32:18.082 --> 32:19.356
You're right.

32:20.326 --> 32:23.269
I still believe this showcase
can be everything for us.

32:25.331 --> 32:26.679
Okay.

track and get this.

35:11.497 --> 35:13.118
All right, then. That rehearsal.

35:14.844 --> 35:16.693
- You're gonna love this place.
- I'm excited.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.547
- Hey!
- Best steaks ever.

35:19.872 --> 35:22.500
You said you wasn't gonna
see that fool no more.

35:22.506 --> 35:23.969
Who's this?

35:23.975 --> 35:26.538
- Oh, he don't know?
- This is Omari.

35:26.544 --> 35:28.940
He was just helping me out
when I was on the inside.

35:28.946 --> 35:30.975
Nah, you was calling me
something else last night.

35:30.981 --> 35:32.477
Are you sleeping with him?

35:32.483 --> 35:33.813
And we together, fool.

35:33.820 --> 35:34.930
Omari, stop.

35:42.660 --> 35:45.857
Yeah, you know what to do, baby.

35:45.863 --> 35:48.060
I'm sorry, O,

35:48.066 --> 35:49.995
but I can't be with you.

35:51.970 --> 35:54.799
You can't say no to me, girl.

35:54.805 --> 35:56.307
But I can say no.

36:09.519 --> 36:11.850
Baby, listen, I'm sorry.

36:11.856 --> 36:13.352
I'm sorry. I'm with you, Elliot.

36:13.358 --> 36:16.064
No, I can't keep getting
hurt by you like this.

36:28.035 --> 36:29.661
I've been looking for you.

36:30.218 --> 36:31.523
Why?

36:34.044 --> 36:35.598
I'm sorry.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.482
Okay, I'm really sorry.

36:39.707 --> 36:42.958
I know what it's like letting
somebody in your head,

36:42.965 --> 36:46.513
and I don't want that to
happen to you before the show.

36:49.252 --> 36:50.960
Who said you were in my head?

36:52.936 --> 36:55.527
Okay. From here on out,

36:55.534 --> 36:58.938
I promise to keep things
strictly professional.

37:11.768 --> 37:13.393
Don't kiss me again.

37:13.984 --> 37:16.146
Okay.

37:17.191 --> 37:18.209
Okay.

37:22.260 --> 37:23.928
Okay.

37:38.516 --> 37:40.071
You sounded great today.

37:40.713 --> 37:42.306
Really.

37:42.842 --> 37:45.374
- Thanks.
- So, after you got your album

37:45.381 --> 37:46.844
and you go on tour

37:46.850 --> 37:49.114
and you got all the
money you need,

37:49.120 --> 37:50.748
what are you gonna do?

37:50.754 --> 37:52.352
Hmm.

37:53.776 --> 37:55.997
Get me and Star a huge place.

37:57.028 --> 37:58.296
What about you?

38:04.797 --> 38:06.086
I'll find my mom.

38:07.661 --> 38:09.935
I'm gonna buy a
studio for myself.

38:10.579 --> 38:12.169
What happened to your mom?

38:13.175 --> 38:15.679
Nah, I don't want
to talk about that.

38:17.507 --> 38:19.269
What do you think
about my uncle?

38:19.276 --> 38:21.395
I mean, he's shady as hell,

38:21.402 --> 38:23.906
but he's okay, I guess.

38:27.538 --> 38:29.474
He stole my song.

38:32.863 --> 38:36.127
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

38:36.133 --> 38:39.459
You know, you're the realest
person I've met since I got here.

38:42.149 --> 38:44.136
Uh, I saw you the other day

38:44.741 --> 38:47.570
with those, uh, pills.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.407
I know how to take 'em.

38:51.148 --> 38:52.436
I know what I'm doing.

38:52.892 --> 38:54.527
Just don't get caught up.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.382
I've been there.

40:05.338 --> 40:08.552
I came to town because
Arlene Morgan paid me to.

40:08.943 --> 40:10.919
She said she needed
something from you.

40:10.926 --> 40:12.974
I had these people after me...

40:13.724 --> 40:15.827
