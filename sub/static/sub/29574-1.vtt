always be treating him

33:33.779 --> 33:36.513
Look, I know things
have been a little...

33:39.251 --> 33:41.218
...but if there's ever anything
you want to talk about...

33:43.389 --> 33:44.788
You know...

33:45.791 --> 33:47.391
"Talk."

33:50.462 --> 33:52.763
[Dad]: Hey, someone want
to give me a hand over here?

33:54.433 --> 33:56.266
Go. Help your father.

34:03.142 --> 34:04.474
Dammit.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.215
Just take them over there.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.817
Just take them--

34:13.819 --> 34:15.152
just stop-- stop!

34:16.822 --> 34:17.788
Dammit.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.848
What have you
got there?

34:47.820 --> 34:49.085
What?

34:50.188 --> 34:51.855
You wanna play me
at checkers?

34:56.395 --> 34:57.561
You any good?

35:58.557 --> 35:59.556
What?

35:59.558 --> 36:02.259
Just 'cause you're deaf,

36:02.261 --> 36:03.860
you think
I'm going to let you win?

36:06.565 --> 36:08.398
You win
when you win.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.169
Now pick that shit up.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.889
Hey. Hey!

36:35.227 --> 36:36.960
Did I say we were done?

36:41.967 --> 36:42.832
Come on.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.508
Hey. Look at that.
Right there.

36:52.844 --> 36:56.413
You just moved your piece
in front of my king.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.282
And all I gotta do is...

37:00.986 --> 37:01.985
[protests]

37:01.987 --> 37:02.986
Oh, hey.

37:02.988 --> 37:05.522
Don't go crying.

37:05.524 --> 37:07.390
You still got your hand
on that piece.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.226
All right?

37:09.228 --> 37:11.261
Just think before you move.

37:16.969 --> 37:18.368
Better.

37:22.507 --> 37:23.740
How old are ya?

37:27.379 --> 37:28.979
I got a daughter your age.

37:30.649 --> 37:33.516
Well, turns 10 in October.

37:35.687 --> 37:38.688
Lives with her Mama.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.291
Now, don't tell anyone
I told you that.

37:48.267 --> 37:49.266
You'd like her.

37:53.338 --> 37:55.438
Well...

37:55.440 --> 37:57.307
Maybe not now, but one day.

38:05.584 --> 38:06.916
Can I ask you
a personal question?

38:10.889 --> 38:13.023
How come you got
boogers in your hair?

38:25.304 --> 38:26.036
[boy]: I'm cold.

38:28.940 --> 38:31.074
[second boy]:
School's about to start.

38:35.714 --> 38:37.447
[man]: <i> Every day, huh?</i>

38:40.552 --> 38:41.551
This kid...

38:41.553 --> 38:43.820
he bigger than you?

38:46.425 --> 38:47.490
Yeah.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.593
Hmm.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.763
You take a thermos to school?

38:57.769 --> 38:58.768
You got a piggy bank?

39:03.608 --> 39:04.974
Bring 'em both here.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.647
Your thermos.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.133
Give me your bag.

39:32.738 --> 39:34.371
All right.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.761
See? You try it.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.770
What are you trying to do,
you trying to kill a fly?

40:06.772 --> 40:08.505
No?

40:08.507 --> 40:09.606
You could have fooled me.

40:09.608 --> 40:11.107
Come on, try again.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.112
Aw, Jesus Christ.
Look.

40:20.419 --> 40:21.651
Hey?

40:22.788 --> 40:24.454
Just like that.
Come on.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.059
Again!

40:31.496 --> 40:32.662
Again, come on!

40:35.567 --> 40:36.633
What the hell's wrong with you?

40:36.635 --> 40:39.502
Do you like
getting pushed around?

40:39.504 --> 40:41.438
You like being made fun of?

40:41.440 --> 40:42.572
You like coming home

40:42.574 --> 40:43.840
with other kids' snot
in your hair?

40:45.210 --> 40:48.211
No? Then stop acting
like such a goddamn pussy

40:48.213 --> 40:51.080
and swing that thing
like you mean it!

41:06.531 --> 41:08.798
You scared?
About tomorrow?

41:10.769 --> 41:11.868
You afraid
of what's going to happen

41:11.870 --> 41:13.236
if you hurt that boy?

41:16.541 --> 41:18.942
You afraid of what's going
to happen if you don't?

42:03.188 --> 42:04.654
[man]:
<i> Just remember what I said.</i>

42:04.656 --> 42:06.723
Stay calm.

42:15.834 --> 42:17.534
Stand your ground.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.848
Look him straight in the eye...

42:38.056 --> 42:39.989
...and break
his goddamn head open.

43:29.908 --> 43:32.008
[Mom]:
Wesley, this is Mr. Chambers.

43:33.378 --> 43:36.012
[Mr. Chambers]:
Hello, Wesley.

43:36.014 --> 43:38.114
[Mom]:
Want to come have a seat?

43:48.026 --> 43:50.360
Well, three weeks ago,

43:50.362 --> 43:54.330
there was a robbery
in Auburn, South Dakota.

43:54.332 --> 43:56.366
Now, five armed men
entered the...

43:56.368 --> 43:58.301
Oh, you need to...

43:58.303 --> 43:59.402
Oh, yeah.

43:59.404 --> 44:00.970
Of course. Sorry.

44:04.943 --> 44:08.311
Four out of the five men
have been apprehended.

44:09.648 --> 44:10.880
One man is left.

44:10.882 --> 44:13.149
This Man.

44:15.086 --> 44:18.788
We believe he may be hiding
somewhere in Richfield.

44:18.790 --> 44:20.023
Two weeks ago,

44:20.025 --> 44:21.391
the Russell County
Sheriff's Department

44:21.393 --> 44:23.577
tracked him down

44:23.578 --> 44:25.762
to the Hotel Garson
on Route 23.

44:25.764 --> 44:27.864
We believe he may be hurt.

44:27.866 --> 44:29.799
Wounded.

44:29.801 --> 44:31.134
Possibly incapacitated.

44:33.004 --> 44:36.072
Now, if this man
is still in Richfield,

44:36.074 --> 44:37.407
he's going to be doing

44:37.409 --> 44:38.841
everything in his power
to try to escape,

44:38.843 --> 44:41.010
and it's my job

44:41.012 --> 44:43.880
to see that he's apprehended
before that can happen.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.418
I was hoping that
you might be able to help me.

44:53.324 --> 44:56.125
So, have you seen
this man, Wesley?

45:04.069 --> 45:05.401
Can he...?

45:06.738 --> 45:10.773
Wesley, Mr. Chambers
asked you a question.

45:17.148 --> 45:18.981
[Mr. Chambers]:
Take a good look.

45:27.792 --> 45:30.793
Would it be all right if I spoke
to your son in private?

45:33.398 --> 45:34.897
Oh, I don't...

45:34.899 --> 45:36.833
It'll only take a minute.

45:36.835 --> 45:38.101
Please?

45:42.407 --> 45:43.406
I'm just going to be

45:43.408 --> 45:46.075
right in the other
room, okay?

45:46.077 --> 45:47.844
Thank you.

45:49.514 --> 45:50.813
I imagine...

45:55.120 --> 45:56.919
you must get a lot of animals
around here,

45:56.921 --> 45:58.488
being this far away
from the interstate, huh?

46:01.126 --> 46:04.527
Deer... foxes... moose?

46:06.131 --> 46:08.931
You know, where I'm from...

46:08.933 --> 46:10.767
we had mountain lions.

46:13.838 --> 46:16.506
We had a neighbor...

46:16.508 --> 46:18.841
Mrs. Stratton.

46:18.843 --> 46:22.945
She was always feeding
all the neighborhood cats.

46:22.947 --> 46:24.547
Strays, mostly.

46:24.549 --> 46:26.783
They would just
come down to her house.

46:26.785 --> 46:30.119
She would leave out
plates of food and milk.

46:32.056 --> 46:33.940
Then one day,

46:33.941 --> 46:35.825
she starting feeding
this baby mountain lion.

46:38.062 --> 46:39.829
It went on for weeks.

46:39.831 --> 46:43.466
She would feed it
and care for it.

46:43.468 --> 46:45.134
She even named it.

46:48.573 --> 46:50.557
And a few weeks later,

46:50.558 --> 46:52.542
that same mountain lion
killed Mrs. Stratton.

46:54.913 --> 46:58.548
Her, her family...

46:58.550 --> 47:00.449
even all them cats.

47:01.986 --> 47:04.320
But I guess
that's just what happens.

47:10.028 --> 47:11.828
That's my ride.

47:14.966 --> 47:16.165
Nice to meet you, Wesley.

48:07.986 --> 48:09.919
It's okay.

48:09.921 --> 48:11.621
You can look.

48:15.960 --> 48:17.526
Want to know how I lost it?

48:19.297 --> 48:20.897
You sure?

48:26.971 --> 48:28.037
A tiger.

48:31.943 --> 48:34.243
What, you don't believe me?

48:36.080 --> 48:37.280
It's true.

48:38.950 --> 48:40.049
If you look real close,

48:40.051 --> 48:41.083
you can still see
the teeth marks.

48:43.655 --> 48:45.354
Bit it clean off.

48:45.356 --> 48:47.056
So you know what I did?

48:49.193 --> 48:53.129
I learned how to hunt,

48:53.131 --> 48:57.199
and I learned how to track,

48:57.201 --> 49:00.236
and one day,
I found that mean ol' tiger.

49:01.973 --> 49:05.007
And I when I did,

49:05.009 --> 49:07.977
I reached down his throat,

49:07.979 --> 49:09.312
and I ripped his heart out.

49:11.082 --> 49:13.182
And I squeezed it so tight...

49:14.619 --> 49:20.289
...that I turned it into
a little red ruby.

49:25.663 --> 49:27.596
And ever since then,

49:27.598 --> 49:32.702
no tiger has ever taken
another bite out of me again.

49:57.362 --> 49:59.195
Hey.

49:59.197 --> 50:01.163
Hey, you can't stay here.

50:01.165 --> 50:03.099
They look for you,
they find me.

50:21.219 --> 50:22.351
[teacher]: Does it look like

50:22.353 --> 50:23.652
the planets in this model

50:23.654 --> 50:25.121
are traveling
at different speeds?

50:25.123 --> 50:28.457
How many marbles...

50:30.728 --> 50:33.129
[teacher's voice
continues, muted]

50:46.377 --> 50:47.810
Eat shit, retard.

50:53.751 --> 50:56.385
[police radio chatter,
indistinct]

51:00.491 --> 51:02.158
[officer]: Copy that. Over.

51:05.163 --> 51:06.562
I don't see anything.
I'll check around back.

51:12.503 --> 51:18.274
I pledge allegiance

51:18.276 --> 51:20.609
to the flag

51:20.611 --> 51:26.449
of the United States
of America...

51:26.451 --> 51:31.821
...and to the Republic
for which...

51:31.823 --> 51:32.755
for which...

51:35.193 --> 51:37.259
I'm saying fucking "for which."

51:37.261 --> 51:40.096
Oh, my God,
"For which..."

51:40.098 --> 51:41.864
it stands...

51:41.866 --> 51:43.466
one nation...

51:43.468 --> 51:46.102
under God.

51:47.505 --> 51:49.405
Indivisible...

51:49.407 --> 51:51.140
"Indivisible"?

51:51.142 --> 51:52.808
That a word
you deaf kids use a lot?

51:52.810 --> 51:55.177
"Indivisible"?

51:55.179 --> 51:56.879
Yeah?

51:58.382 --> 52:00.216
"With liberty...

52:00.218 --> 52:02.218
...and justice...

52:02.220 --> 52:04.353
for all."

52:04.355 --> 52:05.521
All right.

52:05.523 --> 52:08.891
Hey, do you know any cusses?

52:15.800 --> 52:17.399
Come on.

52:17.401 --> 52:19.468
Wait, wait, wait.

52:31.916 --> 52:33.516
Shit!

52:33.518 --> 52:35.217
Shit.

52:36.821 --> 52:38.154
You think that's funny?

52:38.156 --> 52:39.788
Yeah?

53:28.573 --> 53:29.438
Perimeter one check.

53:43.754 --> 53:45.588
[officer on radio]:
<i> Affirmative, 218.</i>

53:45.590 --> 53:48.691
<i> We found an old black van</i>
<i> abandoned on the strip.</i>

53:48.693 --> 53:49.592
[car engine turning over]

54:04.609 --> 54:06.542
We gotta be quieter.

54:51.389 --> 54:53.355
[Dad]:
Where are you sneaking off to?

54:57.461 --> 54:59.245
Oh, what?

54:59.246 --> 55:01.030
Did you come here
to watch TV with your old man?

55:03.367 --> 55:07.303
Well, don't bother.

55:07.305 --> 55:08.604
It's broken.

55:11.375 --> 55:13.676
The TV's broken.

55:13.678 --> 55:17.479
The tractor's broken.

55:17.481 --> 55:20.749
I think
every goddamn thing is...

55:23.854 --> 55:26.422
You know, when I was growing up,

55:26.424 --> 55:30.592
we had this furnace
that was always on the fritz.

55:33.397 --> 55:35.664
And the only person

55:35.666 --> 55:39.501
who could ever get it working
was your grandpa.

55:40.738 --> 55:44.773
And every time that furnace
started acting up...

55:48.412 --> 55:51.680
he'd march his ass down there
into that basement,

55:51.682 --> 55:55.017
and he wouldn't come back up
until those radiators were hot.

55:57.488 --> 56:01.023
And no one...

56:01.025 --> 56:03.559
no one could figure out
how he did it.

56:06.564 --> 56:08.597
So one day,

56:08.599 --> 56:13.369
I decided that I just had to go
down there and see for myself.

56:15.806 --> 56:19.375
Well...

56:19.377 --> 56:23.779
It turns out...

56:23.781 --> 56:26.115
it didn't take much.

56:28.519 --> 56:31.787
It didn't take any magic.

56:34.158 --> 56:36.158
It didn't take any skill either.

56:38.662 --> 56:41.830
All it took...

56:41.832 --> 56:45.100
was a good hard...

56:49.407 --> 56:52.040
Now you tell me
where the hell were you going?

57:12.430 --> 57:14.096
Hey...

57:14.098 --> 57:15.697
Hey.

57:19.170 --> 57:21.069
Did the kid at school
do that to you?

57:22.773 --> 57:24.540
Huh?

57:24.542 --> 57:26.442
Hey!

57:57.041 --> 57:59.475
It looks worse now
than it did this morning.

58:00.711 --> 58:02.110
Yeah, well.

58:02.112 --> 58:05.147
You know, you gotta be
more careful there,

58:05.149 --> 58:07.649
sneaking up on your old man
like that

58:07.651 --> 58:10.619
when he's trying
to get that TV working.

58:10.621 --> 58:12.788
You could have a lost an eye
catching an elbow like that.

58:14.024 --> 58:15.190
[Mom]:
You've got to be more patient.

58:18.529 --> 58:20.596
With that damn TV.

58:20.598 --> 58:21.897
If you keep hitting it,

58:21.898 --> 58:23.197
it's just going to keep
getting more broken.

58:23.200 --> 58:25.000
I said I was sorry.

58:25.002 --> 58:27.169
I don't know what you two
were doing up anyway.

58:29.773 --> 58:30.772
I couldn't sleep.

58:32.142 --> 58:33.876
Since when did you become
a TV repair man anyway?

58:33.878 --> 58:34.943
Can we just drop it!

58:43.921 --> 58:46.522
I feel bad enough
as it is already, all right?

58:54.698 --> 58:55.797
Hey, Tiger. Uh...

58:58.669 --> 59:00.269
Tiger!

59:04.942 --> 59:06.875
Hey.

59:06.877 --> 59:07.976
I was thinking about

59:07.978 --> 59:10.279
getting the boat ready
for the spring,

59:10.281 --> 59:11.747
you know?

59:11.749 --> 59:13.615
Sand her down.

59:13.617 --> 59:14.883
Throw a fresh coat of paint
on her.

59:14.885 --> 59:16.084
You know?

59:16.086 --> 59:20.322
Maybe take her down
to the lake come April.

59:20.324 --> 59:22.224
Do a little fishing.

59:24.795 --> 59:26.328
What do you say?

59:34.805 --> 59:38.707
I...

59:38.709 --> 59:39.875
I can't...

59:44.315 --> 59:45.581
Fishing.

59:47.818 --> 59:50.719
Your father
wants to take you fishing.

59:59.363 --> 01:00:01.296
Yeah. All righty, then.

01:00:09.807 --> 01:00:11.073

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:14.876

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:16.378
<i> What a great ride for him.</i>

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.330
<i> That's going to bring up</i>

01:00:18.331 --> 01:00:20.281

01:00:22.853 --> 01:00:24.686

01:00:24.688 --> 01:00:25.887
<i> After that injury last year</i>

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:27.356

01:00:29.193 --> 01:00:31.627

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:33.061
<i> That's bumping him up.</i>

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:35.697
<i> Looking at third place overall</i>
<i> right now,</i>

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:37.032
<i> so he is standing strong...</i>

01:00:37.034 --> 01:00:38.734
Yeah, I'll get one more.

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:41.903
[woman]: So where are you
working these days?

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:51.980
[woman]: Can I get a lift?

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:01.990
[sniffs]

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.413
Can I fucking help you?

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:21.837
Come on, son.

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:23.472
Let me get you a soda.

01:02:31.048 --> 01:02:33.115
[P.A. announcement]:
<i> Wheelchair to admitting.</i>

01:02:33.117 --> 01:02:34.850
<i> Wheelchair to admitting.</i>

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.267
The concussion's
pretty bad, so...

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:54.770
They're going to sedate him
until the swelling goes down.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.073
When he didn't come home
last night,

01:02:58.075 --> 01:02:59.374
I just assumed

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:01.176
he was staying over
at Richie's place.

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:03.945
But then Edna called and said...

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:05.881
that his truck was still parked
at the King's Head this morning,

01:03:05.883 --> 01:03:07.082
so I...

01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:11.853
I already canceled
the credit card just to be sure.

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:19.795
Yeah. It's quiet here.

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:25.100
I don't know, Mom.
I don't know.

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:26.434
Can I call you back?

01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:29.571
Okay.

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:40.882
Why don't you come sit
next to me for a change?

01:03:42.853 --> 01:03:44.152
Come on.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:55.263
Are you hungry?

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:58.834
Hungry?

01:04:14.551 --> 01:04:15.984
Annabelle.

01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:20.055
What do you think about that
for a horse's name?

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:24.259
Do you like it?

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:25.327
Yeah.

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:29.297
I like it, too.

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:39.274
You know, when I was
about your age,

01:04:39.276 --> 01:04:42.277
maybe a couple of years younger,

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:46.448
my daddy bought
a stable of coldbloods

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:49.084
from a horse rancher
down in Duncan.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:53.088
It was my job to feed 'em,

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:54.289
clean 'em,

01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:55.891
file their hooves,

01:04:55.893 --> 01:04:57.325
haul their shit.

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:59.294
About the only thing
my daddy wouldn't let me do

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:02.163
was name 'em.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:08.303
It didn't make feeding time
any easier, I'll tell you that.

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:12.240
Hmm.

01:05:15.245 --> 01:05:19.948
The night the fire started,

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:26.421
my daddy took my sister and me
out for ice cream.

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:30.458
That's the only time

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.162
my dad took me or my sister
anywhere.

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:40.268
The insurance
paid for the damage,

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:44.072
and then some,

01:05:44.074 --> 01:05:46.141
and we hauled off the horses,

01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:48.243
or what was left of them,

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:52.213
to the rambles
on the back of the flatbed.

01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:57.719
I guess my daddy figured

01:05:57.721 --> 01:05:59.354
it would be easier
to let them go

01:05:59.356 --> 01:06:02.290
if I hadn't known their names.

01:06:04.995 --> 01:06:09.731
You know, one day,
when things settle down,

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:13.301
I'm going to get
a horse farm of my own.

01:06:14.504 --> 01:06:20.308
I'll have colts, mustangs,
coldbloods, warmbloods.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:22.677
And I'm going to name
every damn last one of them.

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:31.319
You know...

01:06:34.358 --> 01:06:36.458
You should come with me.

01:06:38.362 --> 01:06:40.662
I'll teach you how to ride,

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:43.198
how to rope.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:47.335
Maybe I can even get my daughter
to come up for a visit.

01:06:48.705 --> 01:06:50.271
Hmm.

01:06:51.475 --> 01:06:54.743
It would just the three of us.

01:06:54.745 --> 01:06:58.747
You, me, and my baby girl.

01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:06.388
We'll ride off into the sunset.

01:07:10.427 --> 01:07:13.028
Just like in the movies.

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:21.169
[teacher]:
I'm going on a trip.

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:26.074
I'm going on a trip.

01:07:27.811 --> 01:07:29.544
I'm going on a trip.

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:37.085
I'm going on a trip.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.301
I'm going on a trip.

01:08:35.178 --> 01:08:37.412
[P.A. announcement]:
<i> Dr. Norbury to O.R. 2.</i>

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:39.546
<i> Dr. Norbury to O.R. 2.</i>

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:27.929
[man]: Come here.

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:31.265
I want to show you something.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.935
Here.

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.339
See that?

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:40.341
Right there.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.279
It came by twice this morning.

01:09:46.183 --> 01:09:48.883
Yesterday, same thing.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.189
The day before that, only once.

01:09:55.959 --> 01:10:01.429
Sometimes, it pulls
to the side of the road

01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:03.298
and just sits there.

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:10.438
Why do you think that is?

01:11:36.359 --> 01:11:38.459
The plow didn't come by
at all today.

01:11:39.596 --> 01:11:41.462
Not once.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.567
Did you tell anyone about me?

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:49.971
No?

01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:51.472
Not your mom?

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:53.508
Your dad?

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:55.560
Well, that is good,

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:57.611
because if I find out
that you are lying,

01:11:57.614 --> 01:12:00.014
I swear to Christ, boy--

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:01.015
[Mom]: Hold on, Amber.

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:02.617
Let me check on your brother.

01:13:09.119 --> 01:13:11.586
[man]:
Where the fuck have you been?

01:13:11.588 --> 01:13:14.389
I've been sitting here all day,
on my ass waiting for you.

01:13:18.528 --> 01:13:20.828
I thought we had an arrangement,
you and me.

01:13:25.568 --> 01:13:27.735
All right.

01:13:27.737 --> 01:13:31.506
Tomorrow night, then.

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:33.541
And don't be late.

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:37.678
Well...

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.846
That is what you get

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:40.415
when you put your life

01:13:40.417 --> 01:13:42.150
in the hands of someone

01:13:42.152 --> 01:13:45.153
who hauls chicken grease
around for a living.

01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:50.458
Please tell me you've got
dinner in there for me

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:51.859
because I am starving.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:13:59.100
What are you doing?

01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.535
What?

01:14:02.672 --> 01:14:04.605
What's wrong?

01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:06.808
Here.

01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:08.543
Give it here.

01:14:10.647 --> 01:14:12.213
Come on.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:15.183
Give it here!

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:18.853
Hey!

01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:30.131
Well, I'll be damned.

01:14:35.839 --> 01:14:37.705
There is hope for you yet.

01:14:46.249 --> 01:14:48.616
Hey.

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:49.684
You hear that?

01:14:52.055 --> 01:14:53.621
No, no.
Of course you can't.

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:54.789
Sorry.

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:58.993
Well, if you could hear,

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:01.262
you'd say,
"What is that crazy sound?"

01:15:02.265 --> 01:15:03.798
And I would say,

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:06.767
"That is the sound...

01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:09.203
...of my spaceship landing."

01:15:09.205 --> 01:15:12.540
And it's going to land
right here,

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:14.509
and it's going to land
real soon.

01:15:19.249 --> 01:15:21.716
Tomorrow night, be ready.

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.820
The sky's the limit, son.

01:16:05.295 --> 01:16:06.761
Hey, baby.

01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:08.329
You still up?

01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:11.299
Can't sleep?

01:16:13.636 --> 01:16:15.269
Me neither.

01:16:19.642 --> 01:16:21.309
Want to play a game of checkers?

01:16:25.315 --> 01:16:26.714
No?

01:16:28.318 --> 01:16:30.284
That's too bad.

01:16:30.286 --> 01:16:31.586
I was feeling lucky.

01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:34.989
Hey, I was thinking about

01:16:34.991 --> 01:16:37.658
driving down to Grafton
on Saturday.

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:39.994
Aunt Dotty said they opened
a new indoor flea market.

01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:44.031
I was thinking we could drop
Amber off at Aunt Jackie's

01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:45.633
and go down together.

01:16:46.869 --> 01:16:49.103
Maybe stop
at that pizza place you like.

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:51.772
You know the one

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:52.907
where they make pizza
in the shape of rocket ships?

01:16:55.144 --> 01:16:56.811
We can make a whole day of it.

01:16:56.813 --> 01:16:58.245
Just you and me.

01:17:00.016 --> 01:17:01.682
Would you like that?

01:17:12.161 --> 01:17:13.995
I was reading
my horoscope today.

01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:16.330
You know what it said?

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:23.771
It said
"Storm clouds may be brewing,

01:17:23.773 --> 01:17:26.107
but sunny days lie ahead."

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:29.310
And I believe that.
I really do.

01:17:31.914 --> 01:17:34.115
I have to, you know,
because otherwise...

01:18:37.046 --> 01:18:38.279
Mm.

01:18:38.281 --> 01:18:40.014
You sure you want to do that?

01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:43.451
Yeah?

01:18:43.453 --> 01:18:45.786
Are you really sure?

01:18:49.258 --> 01:18:50.791
Don't say I didn't warn you.

01:19:09.412 --> 01:19:10.778
Well, I'll be damned.

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:16.183
What do you know about that?

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:09.470
Sure.

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:11.272
Why the hell not?

01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:14.074
I can't believe I'm getting used
to these damn things.

01:20:16.112 --> 01:20:18.913
[phone ringing]

01:20:21.884 --> 01:20:23.284
Yeah?

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:32.326
Okay.

01:20:32.328 --> 01:20:34.228
Just keep the engine running.

01:20:36.232 --> 01:20:37.598
I'll be out in a sec.

01:20:52.048 --> 01:20:55.616
Well, I guess this is it.

01:20:58.087 --> 01:20:59.954
Hey.

01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:03.324
I'm going to miss
your mom's mac and cheese.

01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:07.261
Maybe some day,
you can send me the recipe.

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:11.098
Huh?

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:12.032
All right.

01:21:23.012 --> 01:21:24.612
Here.

01:21:26.148 --> 01:21:27.381
I wouldn't want you
to lose that.

01:21:29.886 --> 01:21:30.918
No.

01:21:35.925 --> 01:21:37.892
Uh...

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:39.193
hey.

01:21:39.195 --> 01:21:42.596
I know what I said, okay?

01:21:42.598 --> 01:21:44.064
That was just...

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:46.000
talk.

01:21:46.002 --> 01:21:48.936
You know?

01:21:48.938 --> 01:21:50.604
Talk.

01:21:52.475 --> 01:21:54.975
Besides, you wouldn't want
to come with me anyhow.

01:21:54.977 --> 01:21:56.677
You've got everything
you need right here.

01:21:58.214 --> 01:21:59.430
And anything you don't,

01:21:59.431 --> 01:22:00.647
I sure as hell
couldn't give you.

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:04.218
No!

01:22:05.655 --> 01:22:07.121
No.

01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:12.192
No. No.

01:22:20.369 --> 01:22:23.003
All right.

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:24.338
I've got...

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:25.706
I've got to go.

01:22:27.043 --> 01:22:30.344
Hey.

01:22:30.346 --> 01:22:31.645
Kid, I've got go to go.

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:32.680
All right?

01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:37.651
No.

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:39.219
No.

01:22:39.221 --> 01:22:40.154
All right! Hey!

01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:47.261
Get the fuck out of here.

01:22:53.069 --> 01:22:53.701
Get!

01:23:20.429 --> 01:23:22.262
I got him.

01:23:42.018 --> 01:23:43.150
Everybody in position?

01:23:43.152 --> 01:23:44.218
On my say.

01:24:10.746 --> 01:24:12.079
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:24:25.261 --> 01:24:27.294
[gunfire]

01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:33.387
Hey there, Tiger.

01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:41.428
Why don't you come over here
and give your old man a squeeze?

01:26:49.238 --> 01:26:50.971
Hey. Come on.

01:27:08.891 --> 01:27:11.325
[Amber]: Daddy's home!

01:27:11.327 --> 01:27:13.260
That's right, baby.

01:27:13.262 --> 01:27:14.328
Daddy's home.

01:27:14.964 --> 01:27:20.234
