11:37.932 --> 11:39.699
What are you reading?

11:39.733 --> 11:41.835
It's the intelligence briefing
the admiral prepared.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.670
You should be
reading it, too.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.506
Well, just summarize the important parts.
Listen to this.

11:46.540 --> 11:49.343
Apparently, the atmosphere
of the Krill home world

11:49.376 --> 11:51.045
is permanently shrouded

11:51.078 --> 11:54.014
by a dense cloud cover
that obscures 96%

11:54.048 --> 11:56.016
of the sunlight from
the planet's surface.

11:56.050 --> 11:58.052
A world existing
in perpetual night.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.587
(scoffs) No wonder they're
so cranky all the time.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.089
Hmm.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.191
Oh, crap. You know
what we forgot to do?

12:04.224 --> 12:07.427
What? We forgot to come
up with Krill names.

12:07.461 --> 12:09.863
Oh, my God, you're right. Yeah.
What do Krill names sound like?

12:09.896 --> 12:11.531
I don't know. I don't
think anybody knows.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.200
Probably exotic and alien.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.369
Probably, yeah.
Like Quarz... noth,

12:15.402 --> 12:16.536
like that kind of thing.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.772
Zang... uh, tozon.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.941
Kreeyewloxstein.

12:20.975 --> 12:22.609
Probably not "stein."
No, not "stein."

12:22.642 --> 12:24.711
Like a Haj... valorp.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.113
Froozhengladje.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.281
Haagendazs.
Yeah, see, any one

12:27.314 --> 12:29.049
of these could be right--
we don't know.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.150
(panel beeps)

12:31.651 --> 12:34.654
There's a ship
approaching.

12:36.090 --> 12:37.891
A Krill destroyer.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.226
Oh, man. This is it.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.760
All right,
switch 'em on.

12:50.337 --> 12:53.407
This is the Yakar.
Identify yourself.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.243
Yakar, we are a shuttle
from the Krill ship Kakov.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.078
Request permission
to dock.

12:58.112 --> 12:59.313
(rapid beeping)

12:59.346 --> 13:01.281
They're scanning us.

13:01.315 --> 13:04.918
We're about to find out whether
or not these things work.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.486
You are clear for docking.

13:06.520 --> 13:08.588
(sighs)
You ready?

13:08.622 --> 13:09.956
Yeah.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.274
Hey there.
How's it going?

13:27.307 --> 13:30.510
Come with us. The captain
wishes to speak with you.

13:55.169 --> 13:57.537
Welcome, brothers, to the Yakar.

13:57.571 --> 13:59.373
I am Captain Haros.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.875
This is our
High Priest, Sazeron.

14:01.908 --> 14:04.544
Hi. I'm... Chris.

14:04.578 --> 14:08.215
And this is... Devon.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.150
Those are strange names.

14:10.184 --> 14:11.885
Oh, yeah, not
like Haros.

14:11.918 --> 14:13.520
ED:
Hey, listen,

14:13.553 --> 14:14.988
thank you so much
for rescuing us.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.490
We've been through
an ordeal.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.225
What happened to the Kakov?

14:18.258 --> 14:20.327
It was destroyed
in a battle

14:20.360 --> 14:22.162
with a Union ship,
the Orville.

14:22.196 --> 14:24.664
We were the only two survivors;
we barely escaped

14:24.698 --> 14:26.500
with our lives.
Yeah, they must've had

14:26.533 --> 14:27.867
a crazy good pilot.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.836
I mean, the moves
on this guy.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.172
We... we just
never had a chance.

14:32.206 --> 14:35.342
Strange that you were
the only survivors.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.344
Well... we were...

14:37.377 --> 14:39.746
conducting maintenance
on a shuttle at the time,

14:39.779 --> 14:41.848
and when the Kakov
was destroyed,

14:41.881 --> 14:44.084
the shuttle was thrown
clear into space.

14:44.118 --> 14:47.221
Seems you were
unusually fortunate.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.223
Well... Devon and I prayed

14:49.256 --> 14:51.558
that we
would be rescued, and...

14:51.591 --> 14:53.593
here you are, so...

14:59.566 --> 15:02.102
Can't... can't
do that in these.

15:02.136 --> 15:04.704
We are pleased to be
the answer to your prayers.

15:04.738 --> 15:06.039
Don't you agree,

15:06.072 --> 15:07.574
Sazeron?

15:07.607 --> 15:10.377
The Anhkana teaches
that all Krill are brothers

15:10.410 --> 15:11.711
in the Great Crusade.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.280
Ah, the Anhkana.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.449
That-That's my
favorite book.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.551
Since you have had
a close engagement

15:17.584 --> 15:20.620
with a Union ship,
perhaps you have information

15:20.654 --> 15:23.723
that could be useful
to our present mission.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.259
What... mission is that?

15:25.292 --> 15:26.960
I'd like to hear about it.

15:26.993 --> 15:29.062
(bell clangs)

15:29.095 --> 15:31.231
(bell clanging)
Come.

15:31.265 --> 15:34.301
It is time for services.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.804
HAROS:
I always look forward

15:37.837 --> 15:39.406
to this time of day.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.408
It is a welcome break
from our duties, and a reminder

15:41.441 --> 15:43.277
of our place in the universe
and in the eyes

15:43.310 --> 15:44.611
of Avis.

15:44.644 --> 15:45.745
Avis?

15:45.779 --> 15:47.747
Yes, I agree.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.584
I find services to be
a great source of comfort.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.253
Yeah. Yeah, y-you know,
it's also kind of fun

15:53.287 --> 15:56.456
to see how your coworkers dress
when they're off the clock.

15:56.490 --> 15:59.293
You know, 'cause I think
everybody's got their own style

15:59.326 --> 16:02.429
that they don't really get to...
to show during work hours.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.498
I think it's great to see people

16:04.531 --> 16:07.667
get to really express themselves
through fashion.

16:07.701 --> 16:10.170
Like, you really get to see
the person inside.

16:10.204 --> 16:12.138
You know?
Indeed.

16:18.878 --> 16:20.514
This chapel
is a recreation

16:20.547 --> 16:23.317
of the one in which
I worshipped as a child.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.285
Well, I guess it's true
what they say:

16:25.319 --> 16:27.287
rank has its privileges.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.356
I have never heard
that aphorism.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.990
Who says it?

16:31.024 --> 16:32.626
Oh.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.529
I... I guess
it's me who says it.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.364
It is a wise observation.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.333
Take any place you wish.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.900
We will speak later.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.149
Hello.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.817
Hi.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.219
I am Teleya.

16:59.253 --> 17:01.388
I have not seen you
at services before.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.558
No, uh, actually,
we just got here.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.160
I'm Chris and this is Devon.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.329
We were on the Kakov.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.831
You were?

17:11.865 --> 17:14.000
My brother was
on the Kakov.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.070
I'm... I'm very sorry.

17:18.372 --> 17:22.376
He is now at peace
in the arms of Avis.

17:22.409 --> 17:23.910
Should we tell them
their god is

17:23.943 --> 17:26.045
a 20th century car rental company?
Quiet.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.681
Perhaps you knew
my brother.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.349
He was the
tactical officer.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.184
His name was Arnak.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.288
Oh. Yeah, no, I...
Great guy.

17:34.321 --> 17:35.855
Then you were friends?

17:35.889 --> 17:37.223
Um...

17:37.257 --> 17:38.892
we were, we were.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.695
Yeah, really tight,
me and that guy.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.029
Buddies for life.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.197
Devon and Arnak.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.865
"Darnak," they called us.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.701
Strange he never
spoke of you.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.369
You say you were close?

17:49.403 --> 17:51.905
Oh, man, yeah.
Yeah, we...

17:51.938 --> 17:53.907
we used to take baths
together.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.742
I'm really
gonna miss him.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.411
As am I.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.447
I do know that he
really loved his sister.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.382
That is good to hear.

18:02.416 --> 18:05.785
I know Avis will protect
his eternal soul.

18:05.819 --> 18:07.921
Yeah, he's... he's got
the gold membership now.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.056
Shh. He's not waiting
in any lines.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.625
Going right to his car.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.792
(whispers):
For God's sake, shut up.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.628
(bell clangs)

18:15.662 --> 18:18.264
(bell clangs)

18:22.836 --> 18:24.804
A blessed evening.

18:24.838 --> 18:26.573
Temeen Emideen.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.241
OTHERS (in unison):
Temeen Emideen.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.243
Katniss Everdeen.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.779
Let us now cleanse.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.091
(gasps)

18:45.124 --> 18:48.161
This human was captured during
the taking of the colony

18:48.194 --> 18:50.096
on Chara three.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.099
He believed his
people had claim

18:53.132 --> 18:55.435
to its resources.

18:55.469 --> 18:58.004
But he is not Krill.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.607
And Avis has touched us

19:00.640 --> 19:02.476
with his divine hand.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.611
Hail Avis.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.780
Hail victory!

19:06.813 --> 19:09.883
OTHERS:
Hail Avis! Hail victory!

19:14.153 --> 19:17.691
Temeen Emideen.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.126
OTHERS:
Temeen Emideen.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.128
SAZERON:
Temeen Emideen.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.963
Temeen Emideen.
(stabbing)

19:23.997 --> 19:24.998
Temeen

19:25.031 --> 19:26.332
Emideen.

19:26.366 --> 19:27.501
Temeen Emideen.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.035
Temeen Emideen!

19:29.068 --> 19:30.970
Temeen Emideen!

19:31.004 --> 19:32.506
Temeen
Emideen!

19:32.539 --> 19:34.408
Temeen Emideen!

19:36.743 --> 19:38.678
I enjoyed sharing
worship with you.

19:38.712 --> 19:40.647
Perhaps I shall see you again.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.817
Yeah, this is, uh...
kind of a crazy week for me,

19:43.850 --> 19:45.852
but we'll-we'll
figure something out.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.856
Come on.

19:53.527 --> 19:55.995
Dude, that was the sickest,
darkest thing I've ever seen.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.031
I thought I was
gonna throw up.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.202
Let's go.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.907
By the way, Chris and Devon?

20:07.941 --> 20:10.176
Look, it just slipped out.
I had to think of something.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.546
Let's just focus
on our job, okay?

20:12.579 --> 20:13.780
(camera beeps)

20:15.582 --> 20:16.616
(camera beeps)

20:17.617 --> 20:18.618
(camera beeps)

20:19.619 --> 20:21.387
That is a lot
of pages, man.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.889
Yeah, well, the
sooner we're done,

20:22.922 --> 20:25.224
the sooner we can get
the hell out of here.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.366
May I help you, brothers?

20:33.399 --> 20:35.401
Sazeron.

20:35.435 --> 20:39.372
No. We simply wished to seek
further guidance and comfort

20:39.405 --> 20:41.541
from the Anhkana
for our, uh,

20:41.575 --> 20:44.243
grief over the
destruction of our ship.

20:44.277 --> 20:48.114
Oh wise and powerful Avis,
cover the loss of our vehicle.

20:48.147 --> 20:50.950
And have you found
the wisdom you seek?

20:50.984 --> 20:52.719
I think, I think we did.
Yeah, I think we did.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.087
I think we did, yeah.
Definitely.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.755
I-I know, uh,
for me, man,

20:55.789 --> 20:57.724
whenever I'm having a
bad day, all I got to do

20:57.757 --> 20:59.593
is crack that baby open

20:59.626 --> 21:01.895
to any page and it's just,

21:01.928 --> 21:03.429
just like a back rub
for the brain, man.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.799
It just hits the spot.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.267
So, yeah. I think we're
all set here, yeah?

21:08.301 --> 21:10.069
I think we are. I think we're
done, right? I think...

21:10.103 --> 21:11.404
I think we're-we're,

21:11.437 --> 21:12.639
we're just gonna
go on and, uh,

21:12.672 --> 21:14.608
check in with the,
uh, "Capitan."

21:14.641 --> 21:17.110
And, uh, thank him again
for his hospitality.

21:17.143 --> 21:19.646
So, we'll see ya.

21:19.679 --> 21:22.115
Bye.

21:39.165 --> 21:41.768
These quarters
are like a dungeon.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.336
How can they
live like this?

21:43.369 --> 21:45.104
Well, just be glad
it's not a dungeon.

21:45.138 --> 21:48.842
The Captain trusts us for now.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.177
Oh, God, their literature
is gruesome.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.946
It's like a
Bret Easton Ellis novel.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.013
How much longer?

21:55.849 --> 21:58.518
ED: The ship's night shift
began two hours ago,

21:58.552 --> 22:00.486
so we should be safe.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.131
(grunts) What the hell's
the matter with you?

22:12.165 --> 22:13.466
I was trying to tip-toe.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.034
Don't walk so close behind me.

22:15.068 --> 22:16.736
Sorry.

22:33.386 --> 22:34.821
GORDON:
Look.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.890
That must be Avis.

22:39.392 --> 22:41.695
Man, he's a real dick, isn't he?

22:41.728 --> 22:43.763
Let's do this fast.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.402
My lord.

22:49.435 --> 22:52.238
I request permission to
place a guard on the chapel.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.873
For what reason?

22:53.907 --> 22:55.341
I do not trust
our visitors.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.912
Chris and Devon.
Why not?

22:58.945 --> 23:01.247
I found them in the
chapel after services.

23:01.280 --> 23:04.751
They seemed unusually
interested in the Anhkana.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.385
Is that not a good thing?

23:06.419 --> 23:08.688
Perhaps.
But I am not convinced

23:08.722 --> 23:11.524
their intentions were holy.

23:11.557 --> 23:15.528
You have always had
a suspicious nature, my friend.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.064
But then, you have
earned that right.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.799
If it will set your mind
at ease...

23:19.833 --> 23:21.601
(comm beeps)

23:21.635 --> 23:25.104
This is Captain Haros.
Place a guard on the chapel.

23:25.138 --> 23:28.207
CREW MEMBER (over comm):
Yes, Captain.

23:28.241 --> 23:31.544
Thank you, my lord.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.379
GORDON:
The Union anthropologists

23:33.412 --> 23:35.381
are gonna be digging
through this for months.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.883
Maybe years.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.618
(camera beeps)

23:47.827 --> 23:50.163
My comm scanner's
acting funny.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.733
I think it...

23:53.767 --> 23:56.469
Gordon. The emitters.

23:56.502 --> 23:58.471
Dude, you look like you.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.677
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
Try yours.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.702
♪

24:48.855 --> 24:50.857
♪

25:04.738 --> 25:06.239
(inhales sharply)

25:15.548 --> 25:16.649
Oh, thank God.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.317
What the hell went wrong?

25:18.351 --> 25:21.354
Looks like some kind of
electromagnetic interference.

25:21.387 --> 25:23.689
Try adjusting the
frequency on your emitter.

25:27.861 --> 25:30.529
(sighs)
There we go.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.069
Oh...
Wait a minute.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.004
Interference from what?

25:38.037 --> 25:41.174
Whatever it is,
it's two decks below us.

25:41.207 --> 25:44.543
Giving off a hell
of a power signature.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.219
This is the source.

25:53.252 --> 25:56.956
I'm reading high levels
of neutron radiation.

26:12.405 --> 26:15.041
Well, that doesn't
look friendly.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.043
It's not.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.112
It's a bomb.

26:30.323 --> 26:33.059
We have the Anhkana, let's
just get the hell out of here.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.928
That weapon generates
enough neutron radiation

26:34.961 --> 26:36.629
to wipe out
billions of people.

26:36.662 --> 26:38.664
We have to find out
what they're doing with it.

26:38.697 --> 26:40.599
Well, how are we supposed
to do that?

26:40.633 --> 26:42.635
(sighs)

26:46.639 --> 26:48.607
This is very kind of you.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.277
I have not shared an
evening meal in some time.

26:51.310 --> 26:54.113
Well, you're kind of our only
friend on board this ship.

26:54.147 --> 26:56.415
We just thought we should
get to know you better.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.251
A wonderful idea.

26:58.284 --> 27:01.754
Sorry it smells
like dudes in here.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.656
TELEYA: Thank you,
Avis, for this,

27:03.689 --> 27:04.924
our sustenance,

27:04.958 --> 27:08.027
that it may provide
strength and perseverance.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.330
Would you like
to say a blessing?

27:11.364 --> 27:13.666
W...

27:13.699 --> 27:17.470
Um... Avis.

27:17.503 --> 27:20.006
We try harder.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.179
I'm sorry again
about your brother.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.681
It is difficult.

27:28.714 --> 27:30.449
But in his death,

27:30.483 --> 27:32.818
I have found further
confirmation of my faith.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.954
In what way?

27:34.988 --> 27:36.489
TELEYA: The Anhkana
teaches that

27:36.522 --> 27:38.824
that which is not of
Krill is without soul.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.394
The truth of those words
was reinforced

27:41.427 --> 27:43.729
when the Union
killed my brother.

27:43.762 --> 27:45.198
We will be carrying out
the will of Avis

27:45.231 --> 27:47.066
when we destroy Rana three.

27:47.100 --> 27:50.369
Yes, I've been told
of our holy mission.

27:50.403 --> 27:52.872
The bomb is
very impressive.

27:52.906 --> 27:55.008
Devon and I were
wondering how it works.

27:55.041 --> 27:57.043
We've never seen
anything like it.

27:57.076 --> 28:00.046
It is a prototype
neutron field generator.

28:00.079 --> 28:02.048
It can destroy all life
on a continent

28:02.081 --> 28:03.649
in a matter of minutes.

28:03.682 --> 28:07.153
Rana three will
be the first test.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.555
Rana three is
a farming colony.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.190
They have no defenses.

28:11.224 --> 28:14.727
An ideal site, yes.

28:24.537 --> 28:25.738
We got to warn the Union.

28:25.771 --> 28:27.606
We got to take the shuttle
and get the hell out of here.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.842
They wouldn't be able
to send help in time.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.677
We're here. We have to
find a way to stop this.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.746
This wasn't part
of our mission, Ed.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.514
We were literally
just sent here

28:35.548 --> 28:37.216
to make Xeroxes.
I know that!

28:37.250 --> 28:40.553
But there are over 100,000
people in that colony.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.855
We can't just let the Krill
murder them.

28:42.888 --> 28:44.924
Well, what are we
supposed to do?

28:50.463 --> 28:52.431
The default frequency
of our emitters

28:52.465 --> 28:54.900
operates on a similar wavelength
as that neutron generator.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.535
That's why we
got the interference.

28:56.569 --> 28:57.536
So?

28:57.570 --> 28:59.438
What if we turned it around?

28:59.472 --> 29:01.207
Create a feedback loop,

29:01.240 --> 29:03.776
and use our emitters
to activate the weapon.

29:04.978 --> 29:07.046
We could trigger an overload.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.881
And we'd be able
to do it remotely

29:08.914 --> 29:11.284
from the shuttle.
Exactly.

29:13.419 --> 29:16.289
We came here to try to find
a way to make peace.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.624
And now we're talking about
killing everybody on board.

29:18.657 --> 29:21.594
If you have another answer,
I'm all ears.

29:21.627 --> 29:24.097
We'll need tools.

29:32.171 --> 29:33.906
Chris. Devon.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.274
Teleya. Hi.

29:35.308 --> 29:37.776
Are you busy
at the moment?

29:37.810 --> 29:41.080
Well, we were just on our way
to get our chin horns waxed.

29:41.114 --> 29:42.615
Would you mind taking
a few minutes

29:42.648 --> 29:44.117
to speak with my trainees?

29:45.351 --> 29:47.120
Uh, no. Yeah.
Uh, yeah. No, sure.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.421
Yeah, we can take a
few minutes, yeah.

29:48.454 --> 29:50.823
Excellent. Follow me.

29:55.894 --> 29:57.130
Trainees, to attention.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.280
Children,

30:14.313 --> 30:16.615
these are the brave soldiers
I told you about,

30:16.649 --> 30:18.951
Chris and Devon.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.287
They are here to tell you about
their battles with the Union,

30:21.320 --> 30:22.855
and to answer your questions.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.192
How many humans
have you killed?

30:26.225 --> 30:29.795
Uh, you know, that's
a really good question.

30:29.828 --> 30:32.965
I would have to check my notes
and get back to you.

30:32.998 --> 30:36.369
Why doesn't the Union
believe in Avis?

30:36.402 --> 30:40.839
Well, they worship their
own god, called Hertz.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.341
Do humans have souls?

30:42.375 --> 30:43.676
Of course not, Coja.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.712
Then how can they talk?
Or make spaceships?

30:46.745 --> 30:48.347
A computer can talk.

30:48.381 --> 30:50.149
That does not mean
it has a soul.

30:50.183 --> 30:51.817
Remember the Anhkana.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.320
"Judge not a stranger
by his sheath

30:54.353 --> 30:56.322
but by his sword."

30:56.355 --> 30:57.823
Wouldn't you agree, Chris?

30:57.856 --> 31:00.693
Yeah, that's what my
tramp stamp says.

31:00.726 --> 31:02.328
You know,
I just remembered,

31:02.361 --> 31:04.197
we have some work
we have to finish up.

31:04.230 --> 31:05.864
Is it okay if
we come back later?

31:05.898 --> 31:08.033
Of course. That is fine.

31:08.067 --> 31:10.403
Great. We'll see you then.

31:23.116 --> 31:24.883
Krill or no Krill,
I'm not gonna kill

31:24.917 --> 31:26.519
a bunch of kids.
Well, what about the colony?

31:26.552 --> 31:27.953
I don't know.

31:27.986 --> 31:30.523
But I do know that
if we destroy this ship

31:30.556 --> 31:32.225
with those children on board,

31:32.258 --> 31:35.228
then Teleya's right--
we have no souls.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.596
There are kids on Rana three.

31:39.298 --> 31:40.533
ED:
Coja.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.468
What are you doing here?
I have more questions.

31:42.501 --> 31:44.803
Look, this is not a good time.
You're gonna have to...

31:44.837 --> 31:46.772
I want to know
where the humans come from.

31:46.805 --> 31:48.241
(sighs)

31:48.274 --> 31:50.609
Earth. They come
from a planet called Earth.

31:50.643 --> 31:51.810
But, listen, Coja...

31:51.844 --> 31:52.911
Where is it?

31:53.979 --> 31:55.314
(sighs):
Well, it's...

31:55.348 --> 31:57.916
it's really far away.

31:57.950 --> 32:00.286
See that bright star
right there?

32:00.319 --> 32:01.887
Right there.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.790
Well, if you looked
to the left of it

32:04.823 --> 32:06.759
with a really
powerful telescope,

32:06.792 --> 32:09.295
you'd see the star
at the center

32:09.328 --> 32:11.630
of Earth's
planetary system.

32:11.664 --> 32:13.799
How come humans

32:13.832 --> 32:15.434
don't look like Krill?

32:15.468 --> 32:17.436
(sighs heavily)

32:17.470 --> 32:19.605
Well...

32:19.638 --> 32:21.807
on Krill, it's
really dark.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.610
Right? And that's why we
all have very pale skin.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.780
But on Earth, it's different
all over the planet.

32:27.813 --> 32:30.082
In some places, where
there's a lot of sunshine,

32:30.115 --> 32:33.085
they evolved special cells
that produce darker skin

32:33.118 --> 32:36.989
that protects them from
ultraviolet rays, and...

32:39.358 --> 32:41.360
Coja, I'm sorry,
but you need to go now.

32:41.394 --> 32:42.761
But I want to know

32:42.795 --> 32:44.430
how the humans get... Later.
We'll talk later.

32:44.463 --> 32:47.132
Okay? Go on, go on.
Go play in traffic.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.967
If we could access the
internal power grid,

32:49.001 --> 32:52.171
how much do you think we could
turn up the lights on this ship?

32:52.205 --> 32:54.106
Well, if we could
induce a power surge,

32:54.139 --> 32:56.309
probably as much
as you want. Why?

32:57.876 --> 32:59.345
Sunlight.

32:59.378 --> 33:01.146
For a species

33:01.180 --> 33:03.782
that evolved in darkness,
sunlight would be deadly.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.951
You remember when we fought
the Krill on Epsilon 2?

33:05.984 --> 33:07.152
They wore helmets.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.788
We always assumed it was
a military affectation,

33:09.822 --> 33:11.790
but it's not.

33:11.824 --> 33:14.960
They were protecting themselves
from sunlight.

33:14.993 --> 33:18.331
Oh, my God.
They're space vampires.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.465
Exactly!

33:19.498 --> 33:22.468
We could amplify the UV

33:22.501 --> 33:25.471
end of the spectrum,
they'd fry, and we'd just get

33:25.504 --> 33:27.005
a bad sunburn.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.041
But what about the kids?

33:30.509 --> 33:32.845
We could blow out the lights
in the classroom.

33:32.878 --> 33:35.648
We just have to make sure we
do it when they're all inside.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.082
Dude...

33:37.115 --> 33:38.817
we're vampire hunters.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.419
Let's go.

33:55.568 --> 33:58.771
Hey, you know what'd

33:58.804 --> 34:00.506
A black velvet painting of Avis.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.040
Yes. That would be good.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.099
Ready when you are.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.868
I can set the timing
of the surge on your mark.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.137
Okay. I'm outside the classroom.
The kids are all inside.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.939
Give us ten minutes to be safe.

Mercer here.
What is it, Gordon?

34:58.096 --> 35:00.098
Sorry. What's the
rendezvous point again?

For God's sake, the bridge,
Gordon, we meet on the bridge.

Oh, right, yeah. Got it.
Sorry. Brain fart.

35:07.039 --> 35:08.741
Hello, Devon.

35:08.774 --> 35:13.111
I hope I didn't interrupt
a private conversation.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.284
Hey.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.487
Chris. You've returned.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.088
Yeah, you know,
I felt kind of bad

35:23.121 --> 35:25.090
about leaving
so abruptly before.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.759
Well, your timing is excellent.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.494
I was just about to let
the class go early.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.629
No, no! Don't do that.

35:30.663 --> 35:31.930

35:31.964 --> 35:34.299
I want to make sure
I have time to answer

35:34.333 --> 35:36.469
everyone's questions,
about the battle.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.277
Perhaps you wish to explain why

35:45.310 --> 35:47.946
you are in possession
of a Union device.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.882
It's, uh...

35:49.915 --> 35:51.684
it's a toy.

35:51.717 --> 35:52.718
A toy.

Ah.

36:09.935 --> 36:12.471
That is a pepper mill.

36:12.505 --> 36:14.172
Got it for Christmas.

36:14.206 --> 36:16.074
Kind of a crappy gift, right?

36:16.108 --> 36:18.210
Yeah, my family sucks.

Teleya, listen to me.
I need you to keep the kids

36:45.037 --> 36:46.439
in this room
until I get back, okay?

36:46.472 --> 36:48.907
Why are they looking for you?
What have you done?

36:48.941 --> 36:51.410
Just please trust me.
On your brother's honor.

I return. Will you do that?
