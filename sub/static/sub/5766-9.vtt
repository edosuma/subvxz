WEBVTT

00:07.800 --> 00:10.462
(soft, passionate moan)

00:12.180 --> 00:14.171
(gasps, pants)

00:19.250 --> 00:20.615
Oh...

00:21.820 --> 00:23.788
(knocking on door)

00:25.790 --> 00:27.280
Yeah?

00:27.320 --> 00:29.129
Uh, Mrs. Florrick, sorry,

00:29.160 --> 00:30.559
the other
bathroom's clogged.

00:30.590 --> 00:32.490
Okay.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.225
Thank you.

00:34.260 --> 00:37.058
(sighs)

00:37.100 --> 00:38.226
(whispering):
Can I go to the jamboree?

00:38.270 --> 00:40.363
(whispering):
Why are you whispering?

00:40.400 --> 00:42.061
Eli said to.

00:42.110 --> 00:44.328
It's something Shannon's
going to next weekend.

00:44.370 --> 00:46.372
It's a Campus Faith jamboree.

00:46.410 --> 00:48.628
No, it's not like
what you think.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.307
It's like a social.
You don't even

00:50.350 --> 00:52.113
_have to believe
In It or anything.

00:52.150 --> 00:54.118
Why did Eli say
we should whisper?

00:54.150 --> 00:56.414
Oh, yeah-- he phoned and said
that Dad needed his rest,

00:56.450 --> 00:58.111
'cause of his debate.

00:58.150 --> 00:59.412
(groans softly):
Oh. ..

00:59.460 --> 01:00.415
(whispering):
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.781
Do you want
some French toast?
Shannon made it.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.627
(whispering):
Tell her about the jamboree.

01:04.660 --> 01:06.321
Tell Mom about
the jamboree.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.725
It's really cool,
Mrs. Florrick.

01:07.760 --> 01:10.160
Like, you sing and
you, like, play games.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.792
It's really good for
preteen self-esteem.

01:11.830 --> 01:13.434
The toilet's
clogged.

01:13.470 --> 01:15.438
Shh! We're trying
to let Dad sleep.

01:15.470 --> 01:16.801
Eli said.

01:16.840 --> 01:18.501
Today is
Dad's debate.

01:18.540 --> 01:20.178
(whispering):
Who's this, Mrs. Florrick?

01:20.210 --> 01:22.349
GRACE:
Oh, he's a guy who killed

01:22.380 --> 01:25.645
his wife and her boyfriend.
Allegedly killed his
wife and her boyfriend.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.341
They're gonna
execute him tonight.

01:27.380 --> 01:29.848
Unless my mom's
appeal works.
Unless the firm's

01:29.890 --> 01:30.811
(phone rings)
appeal works.

01:30.850 --> 01:31.885
I got it.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.512
(smooching)
ZACH:
Shut up.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.857
He's got
a new girlfriend.

01:34.890 --> 01:35.857
It's a study partner.

01:35.890 --> 01:36.788
Okay, could you
all just stop

01:36.830 --> 01:38.684
growing up so quickly?
This is really good.

01:38.730 --> 01:39.856
I told you.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.697
ZACH:
She'll be with you
in a second.

01:41.730 --> 01:44.119
Um, some guy,
uh, Collagan?

01:45.730 --> 01:47.561
Kerrigan?

01:50.570 --> 01:52.572
I'll take it in the...

01:55.580 --> 01:57.901
He got jealous that his
wife was divorcing him,

01:57.950 --> 01:59.542
so he burned down her home.

01:59.580 --> 02:01.741
Whoa. I wish I lived here.

02:01.780 --> 02:04.419
Yes.
This is Alicia Florrick.

02:04.450 --> 02:05.712
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.

02:05.750 --> 02:06.887
This is Jason Kerrigan.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.229
with the Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals.

02:09.260 --> 02:11.387
Yes. Is everything all right?

02:11.430 --> 02:14.752
Yes. You filed
the final habeas petition

02:14.800 --> 02:16.893
for Carter Wright
last night, correct?

02:16.930 --> 02:18.067
Yes.

02:18.100 --> 02:21.558
I'm calling to ask if, uh,
you'll be filing an addendum

02:21.600 --> 02:24.205
before tonight's execution.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.607
I'm sorry, can you...
repeat that?

02:27.640 --> 02:30.905
Will you be filing
an addendum to the brief?

02:31.950 --> 02:33.440
Mrs. Florrick?

02:33.480 --> 02:36.244
Uh, yes, uh, an addendum.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.383
We will be.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.809
Let me phone you back,
if you don't mind.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.488
I don't mind, but
I'm under a bit of a...

02:43.530 --> 02:45.418
Okay. It's okay.

02:45.460 --> 02:47.951
Call me within the hour.
(hangs up)

02:48.000 --> 02:50.218
(sighs)

03:09.350 --> 03:13.582
(rock music blaring,
phone ringing)

03:13.620 --> 03:15.588
(turns music off)

03:17.690 --> 03:19.396
It's Saturday--
I said no calls.

03:19.430 --> 03:20.556
Oh, I'm so sorry,

03:20.600 --> 03:22.295
Will-- it's Alicia.

03:22.330 --> 03:24.662
Oh. Hey, sorry,
I thought it was work.

03:24.700 --> 03:25.928
What's wrong?

03:25.970 --> 03:27.232
Nothing. I mean...

03:27.270 --> 03:29.409
it might be nothing.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.738
Last night I turned
in the appeal

03:31.770 --> 03:34.330
on the Carter Wright
execution, and I...

03:34.380 --> 03:36.371
approximately two minutes ago,

03:36.410 --> 03:38.947
the Seventh Circuit clerk
phoned me back

03:38.980 --> 03:40.948
and he asked...

03:40.980 --> 03:43.346
ifI had an addendum.

03:50.960 --> 03:52.291
Will?

03:52.330 --> 03:54.798
So, tell me what
he said exactly.

03:54.830 --> 03:57.799
He phoned me, and he
said they received our appeal

03:57.830 --> 04:00.435
and he wanted to know
when he could expect

04:00.470 --> 04:02.836
an addendum.
And you never said
anything about an addendum?

04:02.870 --> 04:03.666
No.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.268
When I turned it in
Friday night,

04:05.310 --> 04:06.277
no, I didn't say anything.

04:06.310 --> 04:07.504
But...

04:07.540 --> 04:09.371
Did he phone the office?

04:09.410 --> 04:10.843
No, he phoned my home.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.438
I don't understand--
why did he phone your home?

04:12.480 --> 04:14.539
I put that number
on the buck slip--

04:14.580 --> 04:15.842
if he had any questions.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.017
Where was it left?

04:17.050 --> 04:18.938
I said I...

04:18.990 --> 04:21.652
would be phoning him back
about our addendum.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.681
Good. When does
he expect your call?

04:23.730 --> 04:25.322
Within the hour.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.691
Okay. I have to phone Diane.

04:26.730 --> 04:28.823
I'll phone you right back.
Stay there, okay?

04:28.860 --> 04:30.862
(tires squeal)

04:30.900 --> 04:33.039
(phone ringing)

04:33.070 --> 04:36.267
Oh. Can I just go back
and answer that?

04:39.780 --> 04:41.873
(ringing continues)

04:41.910 --> 04:43.844
What's up?
I thought you were off the grid.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.371
Alicia just got a call from the
clerk at the Seventh Circuit,

04:46.420 --> 04:48.411
asking if we have
an addendum on our appeal.

04:48.450 --> 04:51.715
You're hearing me, aren't you?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.559
Yes.

04:53.590 --> 04:55.319
What did Alicia say?

04:55.360 --> 04:56.987
She said she'd
phone him right back.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.328
Good girl.
Uh, wh-where are you?

04:59.360 --> 05:00.896
Heading back.
Gonna try to pull in

05:00.930 --> 05:02.761
whoever I can on a Saturday.
You're there?

05:02.800 --> 05:04.461
Yes. I was just
going in to see him,

05:04.500 --> 05:05.626
try to keep him calm.

05:05.670 --> 05:07.399
Do you know the clerk
at the 7th?

05:07.440 --> 05:09.567
No. He didn't say anything else?

05:09.610 --> 05:12.329
No. Hopefully, Alicia can
get more when she phones back.

05:13.510 --> 05:16.377
Maybe it should be
one of us phoning.

05:16.410 --> 05:17.399
Nah, this guy's
breaking the rules

05:17.450 --> 05:19.441
trying to tell us
there's something we missed

05:19.480 --> 05:21.038
without actually telling us
there's something we missed.

05:21.080 --> 05:23.480
If we treat this out
of the ordinary, he'll bolt.

05:23.520 --> 05:26.455
He might also be telling us
we have an opportunity.

05:26.490 --> 05:28.082
A last Hail Mary appeal?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.781
You need to get someplace
where you can talk.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.957
I'm sending Kalinda
over to Alicia right now.

05:31.990 --> 05:35.494
Good. I'll-I'll phone you
in 30 minutes.

05:35.530 --> 05:37.418
(sighs anxiously)

05:37.470 --> 05:39.461
Step through, please.

05:45.540 --> 05:47.531
Step back, please.

06:04.430 --> 06:05.419
Hi.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.950
Hi.

06:08.460 --> 06:09.893
How you doing?

06:09.930 --> 06:12.091
I slept.

06:12.130 --> 06:13.791
Good.

06:15.970 --> 06:17.961
You hear anything?

06:20.610 --> 06:23.670
The judges didn't say anything?

06:24.750 --> 06:25.899
N-No.

06:25.950 --> 06:28.441
But we just
submitted it last night.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.085
I got the warden

06:31.120 --> 06:34.419
to agree to a phone call
with your daughter.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.087
Yeah.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.758
That's okay.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.792
It's been ten years.

06:39.830 --> 06:42.469
I don't even blame her.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.764
Ruby's moved on.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.434
You have to know
what you want to know.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.631
Hi.
Your mom?

06:50.670 --> 06:53.935
Yeah, but you can't just
throw her out there.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.448
You work with my mom?

06:56.480 --> 06:57.640
Yeah.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.908
Sure.

06:58.950 --> 07:00.474
DIANE:
And you're sure

07:00.520 --> 07:03.182
the clerk said addendum,
not amendment?

07:03.220 --> 07:04.687
Yes, I'm sure.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.187
Okay, so it's very important
you don't seem

07:06.220 --> 07:07.710
overly eager for information

07:07.760 --> 07:09.057
when you call him back.

07:09.090 --> 07:10.728
WILL: That's right.
The most important

07:10.760 --> 07:12.057
thing to do is sound casual.

07:12.090 --> 07:13.648
You're just proofreading
the addendum.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.998
Keep him talking-- the more
he gives us, the better.

07:16.030 --> 07:19.693
DIANE:
And try to get him to point to
a specific section of the brief.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.061
_ Or ask if there
IS a section missmg.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.499
_ DIANE: _ _
But he might get SUSpICIOUS,

07:23.540 --> 07:25.201
so don't ask him _
too many direct questions.

07:25.240 --> 07:28.129
I think that Alicia
should play this one by ear.

07:29.110 --> 07:30.543
(sighs)
Yes, of course.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.514
Anything he gives us
will be helpful.

07:32.550 --> 07:33.847
Good, Kalinda.
Keep us on your cell.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.142
Sure.

07:42.530 --> 07:44.020
(phone keypad beeping)
(groans)

07:44.060 --> 07:46.597
You okay?
(clears throat)

07:48.230 --> 07:50.221
(line ringing)

07:55.140 --> 07:56.937
Seventh Circuit Appellate Court.

07:56.970 --> 07:58.938
Oh, hi.
This is Alicia Florrick.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.608
We spoke about an hour ago.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.279
You had inquired
about an addendum.

08:03.310 --> 08:04.277
Yeah.

08:04.310 --> 08:06.540
Uh, well, I was going
through our appeal...

08:06.580 --> 08:08.548
MAN (in background):
They're all waiting on you.

08:08.580 --> 08:10.548
Do you want me to phone back?

08:10.590 --> 08:11.409
No, no, that's okay.

08:11.450 --> 08:14.157
(away from phone):
I'll be right in.

08:14.190 --> 08:16.283
I was here going
through our appeal,

08:16.320 --> 08:18.288
and I was just wondering,

08:18.330 --> 08:21.151
uh, which section
you were referring to.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.225
Which... what?

08:23.270 --> 08:26.990
I can't recall which section...

08:27.040 --> 08:31.568
uh, you said that
you felt was incomplete.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.134
(quietly):
Just tell him you'll talk later.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.238
Look, I'm here till 6:00.

08:34.280 --> 08:38.569
If you have an addendum to file,
he needs it by then.

08:38.610 --> 08:39.816
Do you understand?

08:39.850 --> 08:43.217
I understand, but why don't
we talk later-- you sound busy.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.547
Stay by the phone.

08:45.590 --> 08:47.012
(click, dial tone)

08:48.690 --> 08:50.555
Well, we have
a deadline:

08:50.590 --> 08:51.579
6:00 pm.

08:51.630 --> 08:54.895
Great. Nine hours
to figure out what we missed,

08:54.930 --> 08:56.591
or Carter dies.

08:56.630 --> 08:57.722
(sighs)

08:57.770 --> 09:01.262
Captioning sponsored by
CBS

09:11.350 --> 09:14.547
(overlapping indistinct
conversations)

09:16.950 --> 09:19.248
Ladies and gentle...
ladies and gentlemen!

09:19.290 --> 09:21.679
(indistinct conversations
conﬁnue)

09:24.160 --> 09:26.799
(files falling to floor,
conversation stops)

09:26.830 --> 09:29.321
Thank you for your
attention, people.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.636
There are two possibilities
here, ladies and gentlemen.

09:32.670 --> 09:33.967
Either we overlooked
something. ..

09:34.000 --> 09:35.262
(others murmuring)

09:35.300 --> 09:36.961
...O|‘...

09:37.010 --> 09:38.637
we are being pointed

09:38.670 --> 09:40.638
toward an opportunity.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.274
This clerk is telling us
we have a chance.

09:43.310 --> 09:46.006
So, we have
nine hours--

09:46.050 --> 09:49.315
nine hours to save a man's life.

09:49.350 --> 09:51.841
Legal aid... this case
came from your team,

09:51.890 --> 09:54.358
so I want you to head
down to the 27th floor

09:54.390 --> 09:57.279
and look through
every sentence, word, comma.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.957
Did we overlook anything?

09:58.990 --> 10:01.094
Executions have gone through
because of a typo.

10:01.130 --> 10:02.097
Lockhart/Gardner people,

10:02.130 --> 10:03.392
we need to look into this clerk

10:03.430 --> 10:05.295
and the three judges
of the Seventh Circuit.

10:05.330 --> 10:07.036
Is this clerk acting
on his own here,

10:07.070 --> 10:09.368
or is he doing it for
one of the persuadable judges?

10:09.400 --> 10:10.435
Is there anything
in their background

10:10.470 --> 10:12.870
to suggest where we should
be focusing our appeal?

10:12.910 --> 10:15.299
ALICIA: We only need to focus
on two judges.

10:15.340 --> 10:16.170
What do you mean?

10:16.210 --> 10:17.199
Well, the clerk said

10:19.080 --> 10:20.638
Okay, good, there are two

10:20.680 --> 10:22.318
male judges on the panel
hearing our appeal-- let's look

10:22.350 --> 10:23.146
into both of them.
Kalinda,

10:23.190 --> 10:25.044
what do you have
on the clerk so far?

10:25.090 --> 10:27.911
(knocking)
Um... not much.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.225
Uh, Jason Kerrigan,

10:31.260 --> 10:32.227
29 years old,

10:32.260 --> 10:34.399
Yale undergrad,

10:34.430 --> 10:35.727
captain of
the water polo team,

10:35.760 --> 10:36.727
Harvard Law.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.021
He's too young

10:38.070 --> 10:39.697
to leave much
of a paper trail.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.709
But he did work for
the Innocence Project in 2008.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.662
WILL: Good, that's good.
Is he seeing something

10:44.710 --> 10:45.836
in the evidence that
(chuckling)

10:45.870 --> 10:47.679
we should see?
Let's look Into someone

10:47.710 --> 10:49.007
who knew him there.
What?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.177
The Innocence Project 2008?

10:50.210 --> 10:51.700
You know who worked there?

10:51.750 --> 10:53.069
VVho?
Cary.

10:53.120 --> 10:56.681
We have a lead _on someone
who knew him there.

10:56.720 --> 10:57.982
Hanging up now.

10:58.020 --> 11:00.454
You're not
gonna try hIm...

11:00.490 --> 11:01.889
Course I am.

11:01.920 --> 11:02.818
He won't help us.

11:04.460 --> 11:06.997
On your left, here,
this is a, uh, dorm...

11:07.030 --> 11:08.918
I think...

11:08.960 --> 11:10.393
Um...

11:10.430 --> 11:11.465
I have a crush on you.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.833
That's the science lab,
over there.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.167
(laughs)

11:16.200 --> 11:17.701
No, you don't.

11:17.740 --> 11:19.367
I'm not a little girl
anymore, Cary.

11:19.410 --> 11:20.775
I'm 18.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.175
Molly.
You're my first cousin,

11:22.210 --> 11:23.370
and your parents
are trusting me

11:23.410 --> 11:25.298
to show you around
Chicago universities.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.409
I looked it up.
It's not incest.

11:27.450 --> 11:29.179
Oh, boy.

11:29.220 --> 11:30.915
Okay. I got to take this.

11:30.950 --> 11:33.089
I'll catch up
with you. Behave.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.189
CARY:
Hello.

11:34.220 --> 11:36.780
Hey, Cary, guess what I need?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.252
Ah, Kalinda.

11:38.290 --> 11:40.497
I imagine you need something
I can't give you till Monday.

11:40.530 --> 11:41.622
No. I can't wait till then.

11:41.660 --> 11:44.959
Listen, I need to know
everything about Jason Kerrigan.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.729
Jason Kerrigan?

11:46.770 --> 11:49.261
He's a clerk at the Seventh
Circuit Appellate Court.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.439
Yeah, you two worked at
the Innocence Project together.

11:51.470 --> 11:53.335
No.
Yes.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.506
2008.

11:54.540 --> 11:57.509
No, I mean, "No, you're not
getting anything from me."

11:57.550 --> 11:59.347
This is about
your death row appeal.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.940
Oh, come on, Cary.

12:01.980 --> 12:04.517
This is Indiana death row.

12:04.550 --> 12:07.519
Your boss never has to find out.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.118
Look, here's an idea:

12:09.160 --> 12:11.355
Come back to
the State's Attorney's Office.

12:11.390 --> 12:13.927
Start putting these wife-killers
onto death row,

12:13.960 --> 12:15.518
instead of getting them off.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.528
As good as you are
at getting people off.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.367
You didn't really say that,
did you?

12:19.400 --> 12:21.231
Good to talk to you, Kalinda.

12:21.270 --> 12:22.532
PETE_R:
What's gomg on?

12:22.570 --> 12:23.332
We're working

12:23.370 --> 12:26.498
a Hail Mary pass
with this appeal.

12:26.540 --> 12:30.249
Okay. You want me to get
Mom to take care of the kids?

12:30.280 --> 12:32.373
Definitely, because
that's all we need here.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.048
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.469
Jim has to take me
through the debate prep.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.249
Yeah, I'm sorry. I have
to stay by the phone.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.484
The appellate court
might call back.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.509
Hey, don't worry
about it.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.811
Did you try the French toast?

12:41.860 --> 12:43.452
Yep. Five times.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.822
(chuckles)
Peter?

12:46.860 --> 12:50.296
Do you know anything about
the Seventh Circuit judges?

12:50.330 --> 12:52.218
Which one?

12:52.270 --> 12:53.464
The men.

12:53.500 --> 12:57.561
Any reason they would tip
on a death row appeal?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.534
Well, not Oxley.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.902
But I heard that Glendon got
remarried and was going soft.

13:03.950 --> 13:04.905
Glendon?

13:04.950 --> 13:06.577
Don't say it came from me.

13:06.610 --> 13:09.078
You have to keep your tough
stance on the death penalty?

13:09.120 --> 13:10.348
It's the only way to win.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.880
(doorbell rings)

13:11.920 --> 13:13.353
And there's Jackie. See?

13:13.390 --> 13:14.982
You just have to think
her name and she appears.

13:15.020 --> 13:15.987
No.

13:16.020 --> 13:20.195
My goodness.
I forgot my keys.

13:20.230 --> 13:21.390
DIANE:
Glendon?

13:21.430 --> 13:23.068
I thought Glendon
was law and order.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.988
WILL: I just got off
with Kalinda and Alicia.

13:25.030 --> 13:26.327
The word is he married

13:26.370 --> 13:27.997
a religious
anti-death-penalty type.

13:28.040 --> 13:30.600
Then we should be pursuing
actual innocence.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.005
Our arguments
were too technical.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.371
Glendon wants to go our way,

13:33.410 --> 13:35.173
but he needs innocence
to hang his hat on.

13:35.210 --> 13:36.575
Yep,
we're heading downstairs now.

13:36.610 --> 13:37.770
Gonna run _
through the trial transcripts

13:37.810 --> 13:40.244
with Legal Aid, see what other
suspects were overlooked.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.349
Hey. One thing.

13:41.380 --> 13:43.382
Don't let Legal Aid run
with this, okay?

13:43.420 --> 13:45.012
I argued for Legal Aid

13:45.050 --> 13:46.586
to pursue innocence,
and I think they fumbled.

13:46.620 --> 13:49.282
You got it.
Okay. I've got a call coming in.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.926
Hello! I hope to learn each
and every one of your names.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.518
But in the meantime,

13:54.560 --> 13:56.221
we're taking lunch orders
for sandwiches,

13:56.260 --> 13:58.399
so if you have a moment...

14:00.670 --> 14:01.568
Just write your
orders down there.

14:01.600 --> 14:03.602
Lockhart/Gardner is
picking up the tab.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.616
MOODY:
They're gonna try

14:16.650 --> 14:18.311
to bully you,
provoke you.

14:18.350 --> 14:20.056
They smell blood
in the water,

14:20.090 --> 14:21.284
and they want
to tear you to pieces.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.878
Stay out.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.886
Is that French toast?

14:24.930 --> 14:27.558
Leave it. Go.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.319
Where's my position
on capital punishment?

14:30.370 --> 14:33.635
You're not changing your
position on capital punishment.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.467
You know that
Alicia's working

14:35.500 --> 14:37.536
on the Carter Wright
appeal, don't you?

14:37.570 --> 14:39.037
You know, some
industrious reporter

14:39.070 --> 14:40.571
is going to point out
the contradiction.

14:40.610 --> 14:42.578
They're going after family,

14:42.610 --> 14:44.077
because they see you
lose your cool

14:44.110 --> 14:45.304
when they come
after family.

14:45.350 --> 14:46.647
So don't.

14:46.680 --> 14:50.184
You always get quiet
when you get angry.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.541
Just keep talking.
Change the subject.

14:52.590 --> 14:54.558
DIANE:
Ruby?

14:54.590 --> 14:56.353
It's just me here.

14:56.390 --> 14:58.324
No family.

14:58.360 --> 15:01.693
There's nobody else.

15:01.730 --> 15:04.221
Ruby?

15:04.270 --> 15:07.068
RUBY:
It just... It hurts so much.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.590
I-I know.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.403
But if you don't see him,

15:10.440 --> 15:12.465
I think, maybe,

15:12.510 --> 15:14.671
in a week or a year,

15:14.710 --> 15:16.575
it'll hurt more.

15:16.610 --> 15:19.078
He keeps saying he's innocent?

15:19.110 --> 15:20.941
Yes.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.413
Do you believe him?

15:22.450 --> 15:24.589
I-I don't know.

15:24.620 --> 15:26.713
I wish I could tell you 100%,

15:26.750 --> 15:28.411
he's innocent or guilty,

15:28.460 --> 15:30.951
but whenever I've been_ 100%
certain about anything,

15:30.990 --> 15:32.992
I've been proven wrong.

15:33.030 --> 15:35.419
The only thing I know

15:35.460 --> 15:38.122
is nobody should be
without family when he dies.

15:41.570 --> 15:43.538
How long do I have?

15:43.570 --> 15:45.265
To get here?

15:45.310 --> 15:46.971
Three hours.

15:47.010 --> 15:48.602
They only allow visitation
until 2:00.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.540
I don't think I can make it.
I'm in Avon.

15:50.580 --> 15:51.649
Come.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.614
I will talk to the warden.

15:53.650 --> 15:55.743
Just come. Don't go home.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.714
I look like a mess.

15:57.750 --> 15:58.739
Ruby, please.

15:58.790 --> 16:01.987
Come. Right now.

16:04.730 --> 16:08.097
JULIUS: It all started when
Carter and his wife Caroline

16:08.130 --> 16:09.358
separated in 2000.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.628
One month later,

16:10.670 --> 16:12.661
Caroline's apartment
burned down.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.361
The fire was deemed
suspICIous.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.038
Carter had no alibi
for that night.

16:16.070 --> 16:17.662
And he had the motive.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.666
Jealousy.

16:19.710 --> 16:22.099
Caroline took up with another
man, also killed in the fire.

16:22.140 --> 16:23.243
Other suspects?

16:23.280 --> 16:24.770
The public defender
took a stab at him--

16:24.810 --> 16:27.643
a, uh, Frank Gephart.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.272
Testified for
the prosecution.

16:29.320 --> 16:33.256
Said that Carter and
Caroline fought constantly.

16:33.290 --> 16:35.588
Gephart was also a former
business partner of Carter's.

16:35.620 --> 16:39.056
They dissolved their landscaping
business in late 1998.

16:39.090 --> 16:41.695
So Frank wanted Carter dead,
tried to burn him alive,

16:41.730 --> 16:44.426
but didn't know Caroline
already kicked Carter out.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.166
Okay, find him.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.736
Don't go in hard.

16:48.770 --> 16:50.499
Keep me in touch.

16:50.540 --> 16:51.666
Okay.

16:51.710 --> 16:52.699
WARDEN:
You understand, Ms. Lockhart,

16:52.740 --> 16:54.776
the protocols for
lethal injection

16:54.810 --> 16:56.402
are regimented
and exact.

16:56.440 --> 16:57.771
You're asking me to
break my own rules.

16:57.810 --> 16:59.072
I am, sir.

16:59.110 --> 17:00.771
I'm asking you
to make an exception

17:00.820 --> 17:02.412
and let this man
see his daughter

17:02.450 --> 17:03.542
before he dies.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.809
(phone ringing)

17:06.850 --> 17:10.650
I'm going to ask something
in return, Ms. Lockhart.

17:10.690 --> 17:12.829
The last hours
are very hard

17:12.860 --> 17:16.318
for any man, and Mr. Wright
will be emotional

17:16.360 --> 17:17.668
if he sees his daughter.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.395
I need you to calm him.

17:19.430 --> 17:21.830
I don't want trouble
getting him to the gurney.

17:21.870 --> 17:23.508
Do you understand?

17:23.540 --> 17:26.338
To the best
of my ability, I will.

17:26.370 --> 17:29.237
Do you agree to extend
the visitation hours?

17:29.280 --> 17:31.339
SECRETARY:
Hold on a second. Mr. Barkin?

17:31.380 --> 17:32.779
The anesthetist.

17:32.810 --> 17:34.209
I have to take this.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.740
Do I have your approval?

17:35.780 --> 17:37.611
Let me take this,
and we'll talk.

17:40.790 --> 17:42.451
(muffled):
Warden Barkin.

18:01.740 --> 18:03.844
I just think we can get
a delay with this.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.438
What's it called again?

18:05.480 --> 18:08.278
It's sodium thiopental,

18:08.320 --> 18:10.208
the first part
in a three-drug cocktail.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.138
It's the barbiturate
to put him to sleep.

18:12.190 --> 18:12.815
And they're out of it?

18:12.850 --> 18:14.659
How can they be out of it?

18:14.690 --> 18:15.782
The drug expired.

18:15.820 --> 18:17.458
Their executions
are so Infrequent,

18:17.490 --> 18:19.879
it expired, so they're
switching to another anesthetic.

18:19.930 --> 18:22.694
Okay, I'm on my way
to request a delay.

18:22.730 --> 18:25.164
Oh, and ask Carter
about Frank Gephart.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.827
Who is that?
Is that the new suspect?

18:26.870 --> 18:29.395
Yes, a bitter
ex-business-partner of Carter's.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.305
I just sent Blake out
to get anything he can on him.

18:31.340 --> 18:34.878
Julius, your tie.

18:34.910 --> 18:37.549
Whatever Carter has
will be helpful.

18:37.580 --> 18:38.808
Okay, I'll ask.

18:38.850 --> 18:40.670
But we need another week
on all of this.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.711
You're telling me.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.487
MOLLY: Maybe I just won't
go to college.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.181
It's an option.

18:47.220 --> 18:49.381
Become a vagabond.
Write about your adventures.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.580
(phone ringing)

18:50.630 --> 18:52.154
I thought this
was a weekend.

18:52.190 --> 18:53.327
No weekend for
the wicked.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.497
Hello?

18:54.530 --> 18:57.192
SCHECK:
Cary? This is Barry Scheck.

18:57.230 --> 18:58.026
Do you have a moment?

18:58.070 --> 19:00.334
Sure I have a moment,
Mr. Scheck.

19:00.370 --> 19:01.860
Let me just hang up with
F. Lee Bailey on the other line.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.401
I...

19:03.440 --> 19:05.908
Just... Just hold
on a second.

19:05.940 --> 19:07.635
All right.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.409
What do you need,
Barry, old buddy?

19:09.440 --> 19:11.749
You know about the Carter Wright
death row appeal, don't you?

19:11.780 --> 19:15.238
Do I know about it?
I've got tickets.

19:15.280 --> 19:16.747
I'm headed there
right now.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.486
In fact, I got an extra ticket,
if you want to join me.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.585
Cary. This is Barry Scheck.

19:24.630 --> 19:27.428
Yes. Yes, I know. I know.

19:27.460 --> 19:30.258
Do the... Do the funny voice
with the Barry Scheck on helium.

19:32.300 --> 19:35.189
Okay, let me start again.

19:35.240 --> 19:38.767
Lockhart/Gardner needs your help
on a death row appeal.

19:38.810 --> 19:42.200
And I thought because
of your internship

19:42.240 --> 19:44.504
at the Innocence Project,
and my friendship

19:44.550 --> 19:46.245
with your father,

19:46.280 --> 19:48.919
that you might consider
helping out for a few hours.

19:48.950 --> 19:51.783
Michael?

19:51.820 --> 19:54.357
No. Barry.

19:54.390 --> 19:57.780
This _isn't_ Michael
In VIce?

19:57.830 --> 20:00.924
No, this is Barry Scheck in...

20:00.960 --> 20:02.655
here.

20:05.970 --> 20:07.961
Hello, Mr. Scheck.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.638
I'm so sorry.

20:09.670 --> 20:11.661
I... This...

20:11.710 --> 20:13.473
Uh, this guy...

20:13.510 --> 20:15.501
(bell dings)

20:19.680 --> 20:21.671
What do you need?

20:23.520 --> 20:26.239
(laughs)

20:26.290 --> 20:28.019
I can't.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.982
Yes, you can.
Just like this.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.681
Yeah, but I don't believe it.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.527
You don't have to; you
just do it, and it works.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.993
It's like a genie.

20:35.030 --> 20:36.588
Okay, I'll pray.

20:36.630 --> 20:38.598
What's the name of the guy
who's getting executed?

20:38.630 --> 20:40.666
I don't think
you should do this.

20:40.700 --> 20:42.338
Why?
I don't know.

20:42.370 --> 20:44.338
It just...
It feels weird.

20:44.370 --> 20:47.271
Okay, I'll pray that
he won't be executed.

20:47.310 --> 20:49.005
I just need to
ask you, Jesus:

20:49.040 --> 20:51.008
please save
this man's life.

20:51.050 --> 20:52.039
This man on death row.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.014
Only you know
his real heart,

20:54.050 --> 20:56.439
but I just ask you that you
stop this from happening to him.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.640
Carter Wright.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.411
I just pray that
you stop this

21:01.460 --> 21:04.657
from happening
to Carter Wright.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.578
In Jesus's name,
I pray.

21:06.630 --> 21:08.928
And my dad's debate?

21:08.960 --> 21:11.929
That's your husband,
Mrs. Gephart?

21:11.970 --> 21:12.959
Ex.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.638
Oh, sorry.

21:14.670 --> 21:16.763
I need to talk to him.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.301
You have any idea
where he is?

21:18.340 --> 21:20.376
Well, I know
where his ashes are.

21:20.410 --> 21:21.900
Would that help?

21:25.380 --> 21:26.677
What? Did he owe you money?

21:26.710 --> 21:28.314
No. I'm here
about Carter Wright.

21:28.350 --> 21:29.874
I knew it was
something like that.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.980
He's going down tonight,
I heard.

21:33.020 --> 21:34.954
Midnight.

21:34.990 --> 21:38.448
Carter poached Frank's clients.

21:38.490 --> 21:40.958
Took them with him
to his new company.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.321
Frank never forgave him.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.792
Do you have any reason
to believe Frank

21:44.830 --> 21:46.092
had something
to do with the fire?

21:46.130 --> 21:49.793
I got reason to believe
anything about Frank.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.967
But, um, no.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.477
He was with me that night.

21:53.510 --> 21:55.375
At the movies.

21:57.110 --> 21:58.042
Okay, that sucks.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.048
Well, she's willing
to say anything we want.

22:00.080 --> 22:01.809
I mean, I could pursue that
if you like.

22:01.850 --> 22:03.818
No. We got another path.

22:03.850 --> 22:05.340
Head back to the office.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.982
We got a lead on the clerk.

22:07.020 --> 22:08.351
(beep)

22:08.390 --> 22:10.381
We struck out on Frank Gephart.

22:10.430 --> 22:11.886
What do you know, Cary?

22:11.930 --> 22:14.023
Okay, first of all, I'm here
for this, and nothing else.

22:14.060 --> 22:15.823
Understood.

22:15.860 --> 22:18.727
What can you tell us about
your old friend, this clerk?

22:18.770 --> 22:21.432
Jason read a New Yorker article

22:21.470 --> 22:23.563
about the execution

22:23.610 --> 22:25.566
of Cameron Todd Willingham,

22:25.610 --> 22:27.805
and it moved him.

22:27.840 --> 22:31.571
He wrote a paper
about flawed science

22:31.610 --> 22:35.068
in government cases,
or something like that.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.418
Now, The Harvard Review
never printed it.

22:37.450 --> 22:39.987
It's probably sitting
in a drawer somewhere.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.385
Can you get us a copy?

22:41.420 --> 22:42.910
Yeah, I can dig it up for you.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.758
Alicia, Kalinda,
you guys still on it?

22:45.790 --> 22:47.451
Yeah.
You know what this is about?

22:47.500 --> 22:48.649
The arson science.

22:48.700 --> 22:49.928
Methods _for _arson
Investigation

22:49.960 --> 22:51.769
have developed over
the last ten years.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.496
Track down the arson expert
who testified at the trial.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.565
See if his story has changed.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.838
She's coming?

23:09.880 --> 23:11.745
Yes.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.452
The warden will make
an exception If she gets here...

23:14.490 --> 23:16.014
SOOh.

23:16.060 --> 23:17.880
VVhen?

23:17.930 --> 23:19.852
Soon.
Ms. Lockhart,

23:19.890 --> 23:22.154
thank you for
staying with me,

23:22.200 --> 23:25.624
but I need you to talk
to me like I'm an adult.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.661
You're right. I'm sorry.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.964
Ruby needs to be here by 3:00.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.978
She's driving from Avon.

23:34.010 --> 23:35.978
It will be close.

23:36.010 --> 23:38.808
Thank you.

23:38.850 --> 23:43.014
Now, why were you asking
me about Frank Gephart?

23:45.090 --> 23:47.718
There may be a chance
our appeal is finding traction

23:47.760 --> 23:49.580
with the Seventh Circuit.

23:49.620 --> 23:51.952
They asked for
additional material,

23:51.990 --> 23:53.150
and we're trying to supply it.

23:59.230 --> 24:02.028
I don't want you
to be disappointed.

24:02.070 --> 24:04.061
(sighs)

24:04.110 --> 24:06.101
That's my business.

24:07.980 --> 24:11.609
Tell me everything, and I will
deal with my disappointment.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.718
WILL:
I don't care

24:14.750 --> 24:16.775
if a horse tranquilizer
is just as effective

24:16.820 --> 24:18.082
as sodium thiopental.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.587
The law doesn't allow...

24:19.620 --> 24:22.054
Counselor, watch your
tone and your sarcasm.

24:22.090 --> 24:23.626
Yes, my apologies,
Your Honor.

24:23.660 --> 24:24.957
The law doesn't allow

24:24.990 --> 24:27.527
for a shell game
on lethal injection.

24:27.560 --> 24:28.595
And switching drugs

24:28.630 --> 24:32.726
is the very essence
of cruel and unusual punishment.

24:32.770 --> 24:33.930
Mr. Cowan, I understand you...

24:33.970 --> 24:35.961
Please stand.

24:37.640 --> 24:39.767
I understand the State
has an interest

24:39.810 --> 24:41.903
in making its execution date,

24:41.940 --> 24:45.569
but why can't the State order
more of this drug?

24:45.610 --> 24:47.612
Hospira is a publicly-traded
company, Your Honor,

24:47.650 --> 24:48.742
and the only manufacturer

24:48.780 --> 24:50.270
of sodium thiopental
in the country.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.117
They're backlogged on orders...

24:52.150 --> 24:54.152
No, they're concerned
their drugs are being

24:54.190 --> 24:56.078
used in this manner...
Mr. Gardner,
your passion

24:56.120 --> 24:57.758
is noted, and it is dismissed.

24:57.790 --> 24:59.519
Please... stop.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.925
COWAN:
The important thing to note,

25:00.960 --> 25:02.188
Your Honor, is that
the replacement barbiturate

25:02.230 --> 25:05.722
is just as effective, and that
Mr. Gardner is merely attempting

25:05.770 --> 25:07.533
to stall an execution that,

25:07.570 --> 25:10.539
over ten years, has
resisted every appeal.

25:10.570 --> 25:12.538
Be that as it may,

25:12.570 --> 25:14.834
you have other options open
to you, don't you, Counselor?

25:14.880 --> 25:17.542
If you want
your execution to proceed,

25:17.580 --> 25:19.673
then you must acquire
more of this drug

25:19.710 --> 25:21.041
from your neighboring states.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.914
Otherwise, the execution
will be delayed until you do so.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.779
ALICIA:
Yes, I'm looking
for the arson expert.

25:28.820 --> 25:30.117
KALIN DA:
Is this

25:30.160 --> 25:31.184
Dr. Todd Grossman?

25:31.230 --> 25:33.551
Well, do you know where
he might have moved to?

25:33.600 --> 25:35.295
Yeah, he testified
in the Carter Wright trial.

25:35.330 --> 25:36.854
So you don't know
where he moved?

25:36.900 --> 25:38.026
BARKIN:
Are you sure?

25:38.070 --> 25:40.197
I just need one vial.

25:40.230 --> 25:42.198
Sodium thiopental.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.208
In the next eight hours.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.561
Execution's at midnight.

25:46.610 --> 25:48.669
Hi. Can I speak
to Dr. Grossman, please?

25:48.710 --> 25:51.247
Yeah.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.578
Uh, is this the arson expert?

25:55.080 --> 25:57.583
All right, and when
do you expect him back?

25:57.620 --> 26:00.680
No. It's just that
it's very important.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.779
BARKIN:
I understand.

26:02.820 --> 26:04.822
We're having the same trouble.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.590
No, California's too far.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.798
Thanks.

26:11.830 --> 26:13.127
What?

26:13.170 --> 26:14.865
He's getting
on a plane to Florida.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.607
His aide's gonna try
and stop him before he boards.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.665
(sighs)

26:19.710 --> 26:21.701
I think I need
to take a breath.

26:23.110 --> 26:25.374
You know, you've been
different lately.

26:25.410 --> 26:27.139
I've been different?

26:27.180 --> 26:28.875
Yeah.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.911
It's prob...

26:33.890 --> 26:35.881
One second.

26:40.030 --> 26:41.691
JACKIE:
What about the olive?

26:41.730 --> 26:43.254
JIM: This tie is
gomg to strobe.

26:43.300 --> 26:45.097
And this one is ugly.

26:49.700 --> 26:51.258
I'm praying for you.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.871
Thanks.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.911
Life has been playing
tricks on me lately,

27:04.950 --> 27:08.750
and I think it's best
not to take it seriously.

27:09.990 --> 27:12.857
Is this about work,
or is this about Will?

27:15.460 --> 27:18.623
There's a man sitting
somewhere 75 miles from here.

27:20.070 --> 27:22.698
He knows that in nine
hours, he'll be dead.

27:24.710 --> 27:26.701
I can't get my
head around that.

27:33.050 --> 27:35.268
What does Blake have on you?

27:35.320 --> 27:37.845
Have on me?

27:37.890 --> 27:40.415
I don't think
he has anything on me.

27:40.450 --> 27:43.283
Okay, I'm gonna drink.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.322
(laughs)

27:50.460 --> 27:55.693
I didn't like my life
before, so...

27:55.740 --> 27:57.196
I changed it.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.765
You changed it?

28:01.010 --> 28:02.898
How did you change it?

28:02.940 --> 28:06.740
In ways that...

28:06.780 --> 28:08.668
Blake is trying
to use against me.

28:10.180 --> 28:12.148
Are you in trouble?

28:12.190 --> 28:13.919
No.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.484
Were you in trouble?

28:15.520 --> 28:18.455
No.

28:18.490 --> 28:21.425
It's just that
when someone changes their life,

28:21.460 --> 28:23.325
it's usually
because they're in trouble.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.328
Well, you've changed
your life.

28:25.370 --> 28:26.792
(laughs)

28:26.830 --> 28:28.832
(phone ringing)

28:30.000 --> 28:31.968
Hello?

28:33.540 --> 28:35.508
Yeah?

28:35.540 --> 28:37.269
Are you sure?

28:37.310 --> 28:39.778
What time?

28:39.810 --> 28:41.516
Okay.

28:41.550 --> 28:43.745
Thanks.

28:44.550 --> 28:46.279
She missed him.

28:46.320 --> 28:49.483
He's on his way to Florida,
but he has to change at O'Hare.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.956
You'll have to buy a ticket
to get through security.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.321
Yup.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.850
Good talking to you.

28:57.900 --> 28:59.026
Hi.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.958
Bye.

29:11.250 --> 29:12.501
I'm late.
No, no.

29:12.550 --> 29:14.211
I'm sorry.
Thank you for coming.

29:14.250 --> 29:15.774
How's he doing?

29:15.820 --> 29:17.447
He's trying
to stay strong.

29:17.480 --> 29:21.780
I think seeing you,
it'll be difficult, but, uh...

29:25.390 --> 29:27.358
It's 3:20, ma'am.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.893
I know, Warden, sir,
but she just got here.

29:29.930 --> 29:31.397
She rushed from Avon.

29:31.430 --> 29:34.069
Yes, and I said I'd
extend visitation hours

29:34.100 --> 29:35.897
by one hour, to 3:00.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.908
I'm so sorry. I rushed.

29:37.940 --> 29:39.931
It-It. ..
It's-It's okay.

29:41.940 --> 29:43.407
Warden, please.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.271
Ma'am, I live in
a world of rules.

29:45.310 --> 29:46.902
I don't try to
cut corners.

29:46.950 --> 29:48.269
I don't try to
bend the truth.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.242
I make an agreement,
and I stick to it.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.486
It's only 15 minutes.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.512
No, ma'am. It's not.

29:56.590 --> 29:59.252
(whispering):
I was sympathetic, ma'am.

29:59.290 --> 30:01.554
Ms. Lockhart.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.420
But then you took
advantage of my sympathy,

30:03.460 --> 30:05.394
and used my phone call
with the anesthetist

30:05.430 --> 30:06.590
to delay my protocol.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.939
That's when I lost sympathy.

30:08.970 --> 30:09.891
Please. I'm sorry.

30:09.940 --> 30:11.100
It was my fault,

30:11.140 --> 30:12.459
not hers!

30:12.510 --> 30:15.138
Warden, please!

30:18.450 --> 30:20.406
Stay here.

30:20.450 --> 30:21.610
DIANE:
What?

30:21.650 --> 30:23.413
GUARD: Stay here, and
don't say a word.

30:23.450 --> 30:26.010
You'll see a glimpse of
him coming down that hall.

30:26.050 --> 30:28.280
Thank you.

30:30.990 --> 30:32.981
(sighs)

30:37.630 --> 30:39.097
(phone ringing)
Warden Hiatt.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.427
BARKIN:
Sorry to Interrupt you

30:40.470 --> 30:42.859
on your Saturday, Warden,
but I need some help.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.436
This is Robert Barkin at State.

30:44.470 --> 30:46.961
Yes, hello. You have
an LI tonight, don't you?

30:47.010 --> 30:48.329
I do.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.268
We've been slapped
with a last-minute injunction

30:50.310 --> 30:53.438
because our sodium thiopental
is three days out of date.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.141
Do you have any we can use?

30:55.180 --> 30:57.148
Yeah, I probably do.
It's just that, uh,

30:57.180 --> 30:58.943
I'm spending the weekend
with my daughter.

30:58.990 --> 31:00.446
We're going camping.

31:00.490 --> 31:03.152
I wouldn't ask
if it weren't important.

31:06.230 --> 31:07.959
I can send somebody to you.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.525
No, they...

31:10.560 --> 31:12.926
They'll nev...
They won't make it in time.

31:12.970 --> 31:15.393
Uh... I'll come to you.

31:15.440 --> 31:16.566
You sure?

31:16.600 --> 31:17.965
Yeah.

31:18.010 --> 31:20.001
I'll head out now.

31:22.940 --> 31:24.669
Next weekend, baby.

31:24.710 --> 31:30.910
* Under wide blue skies

31:30.950 --> 31:33.589
* There's a place to lie

31:36.960 --> 31:39.258
* For me

31:39.290 --> 31:42.521
* And Evelyn to hide tonight

31:44.100 --> 31:47.422
* I'll try my best
to make a go *

31:49.040 --> 31:51.429
* But I'm not sure
what I don't know *

31:55.110 --> 31:58.238
* Oh, chariots

31:58.280 --> 32:00.976
* If you're out there,
please swing low *

32:05.020 --> 32:08.581
* Tell I got here
at the right time *

32:08.620 --> 32:13.319
* And if I did,
it's probably the first time *

32:13.360 --> 32:18.662
* No second guesses
or secret signs *

32:18.700 --> 32:22.966
* Tell me I got here
at the right time. *

32:36.750 --> 32:39.412
Welcome to the live
televised Democratic Debate

32:39.450 --> 32:41.554
for Cook County
State's Attorney.

32:41.590 --> 32:44.229
OFFICER: All passengers need
to remove their shoes

32:44.260 --> 32:46.728
and put them
in the gray bins.

32:46.760 --> 32:49.399
WOMAN (over P.A.):
At this time, I'll like to ask

32:49.430 --> 32:51.421
all passengers
on flight 1893 to Orlando

32:51.470 --> 32:54.462
to please approach the gate
for final boarding.

32:57.170 --> 32:59.138
OFFICER: Please remove
all metal objects

32:59.170 --> 33:01.775
and put them
in the bins.

33:01.810 --> 33:03.630
All laptops
must be separated

33:03.680 --> 33:06.148
out of your baggage
and taken out of their cases.

33:06.180 --> 33:08.740
All passengers...

33:08.780 --> 33:09.849
Can you raise your arms
for me, please, ma'am?

33:09.880 --> 33:12.644
WOMAN (over P.A.): At this time
I would like to ask

33:12.690 --> 33:14.715
all passengers
on flight 1893 to Orlando

33:14.760 --> 33:18.981
to please approach the gate
for final boarding.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.691
Step over here.

33:29.370 --> 33:32.100
I pressed "program"
and then "record,"

33:32.140 --> 33:33.732
but nothing is happening.

33:33.770 --> 33:35.670
Grandma, let me.
Grace.

33:35.710 --> 33:37.735
PETER (over TV):
I'm an American
born and raised in Chicago.

33:37.780 --> 33:39.668
I have deep roots

33:39.710 --> 33:43.214
in this city,
in this country, and

33:43.250 --> 33:47.789
I am here because I feel
Chicago is in need of...

33:47.820 --> 33:49.685
ALICIA:
I'm wondering
ifI should call him back--

33:49.720 --> 33:51.529
the clerk
at the Seventh Circuit.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.050
We've only got an hour.

33:53.090 --> 33:54.193
No, not yet.

33:54.230 --> 33:55.652
We may have bought ourselves
some time

33:55.700 --> 33:58.521
with this appeal
on the anesthetic.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.219
How are you doing?

34:01.870 --> 34:04.065
I hate this.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.808
Being powerless.

34:07.840 --> 34:10.104
Yeah.

34:10.140 --> 34:12.779
He saw his daughter today.

34:12.810 --> 34:13.777
Carter did.

34:13.810 --> 34:15.516
That's something.

34:15.550 --> 34:18.519
That is more
than something.

34:22.590 --> 34:24.558
Will?

34:24.590 --> 34:26.729
Yeah.

34:27.790 --> 34:31.590
Could... we talk sometime?

34:32.670 --> 34:34.638
We can talk anytime.

34:34.670 --> 34:36.092
No, I mean...

34:36.740 --> 34:38.731
We need a moment.

34:40.410 --> 34:44.779
Just a moment when things don't
seem so all over the place.

34:44.810 --> 34:47.472
Okay, that's probably not now.

34:47.510 --> 34:48.738
(chuckles)
No.

34:48.780 --> 34:50.247
(knocking)

34:50.280 --> 34:52.248
Hi, Mrs. Florrick.

34:52.290 --> 34:54.884
Sorry, Zach said
I could use the bathroom.

34:54.920 --> 34:56.478
Sure.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.659
I'm Zach's _
study partner Nisa.

34:58.690 --> 35:00.157
Hi, Nisa.

35:00.190 --> 35:02.226
WOMAN (over P.A.):
At this time I'd like to ask

35:02.260 --> 35:05.297
all passengers
on flight 1893 to Orlando

35:05.330 --> 35:08.697
to please approach the gate
for final boarding.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.568
Dr. Grossman?

35:12.610 --> 35:15.306
Um, do you have
a minute, please?

35:15.340 --> 35:16.568
Do I know you?

35:16.610 --> 35:18.601
I'm working for the
Carter Wright defense team.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.107
I really need a minute
of your time, please.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.190
WOMAN (over PA):
This is the final boarding call
for flight 1893

35:34.230 --> 35:35.424
to Orlando.

35:35.460 --> 35:36.893
KALINDA: But the science
has changed, sir,

35:36.930 --> 35:39.490
the arson science
has changed.

35:39.530 --> 35:41.293
Yes, but the physics hasn't.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.490
You see these "V"
patterns on the wall?

35:43.540 --> 35:45.929
A fire typically
burns up and out,

35:45.970 --> 35:47.767
and a "V" pattern indicates
a point of origin

35:47.810 --> 35:50.779
for a fire produced by
accelerants, ergo arson.

35:50.810 --> 35:52.698
Yes, but this can also
indicate the presence

35:52.750 --> 35:55.344
of a knob and tube wiring
burn-off.

35:56.380 --> 35:57.813
Are you in the trade, miss?

35:57.850 --> 35:59.886
No, but I just
read a paper

35:59.920 --> 36:01.956
by a young clerk
in the Seventh Circuit

36:01.990 --> 36:04.458
aboutchanges
in arson science,

36:04.490 --> 36:05.923
especially when applied
to structures

36:05.960 --> 36:07.825
over 80 years old,
as this apartment was.

36:07.860 --> 36:10.693
Well, certainly "V" patterns
aren't always indicative

36:10.730 --> 36:12.595
of a point of origin, but...

36:12.630 --> 36:14.962
You see these brown stains?

36:15.000 --> 36:17.537
They indicate accelerant
in the hallway.

36:17.570 --> 36:19.367
And I really must
get on my plane.

36:19.410 --> 36:20.365
No, sir.

36:20.410 --> 36:21.434
Look, these brown stains

36:21.480 --> 36:24.574
are just as likely to come
from flashover burns.

36:24.610 --> 36:26.305
You know about the
changes In arson SCIence.

36:26.350 --> 36:27.749
You know_ what I'm
saying Is true.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.873
No, I know what you're saying
is possible, that's all.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.616
Yeah, and all Carter Wright
needs is what's possible.

36:32.650 --> 36:34.959
Look, you said at the trial
that you were 100% positive

36:34.990 --> 36:36.855
that these stains were
proof of an accelerant.

36:36.890 --> 36:40.724
Now, if your opinion
has changed...

36:40.760 --> 36:42.955
There are other
people you can ask.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.888
No, sir.

36:44.930 --> 36:47.967
There are other
experts you can get.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.230
Not in an hour
and not with your authority.

36:50.270 --> 36:51.567
I'm sorry.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.703
Actually, I'm sorry.

36:55.610 --> 36:57.578
I can't help you.

36:57.610 --> 36:59.942
You can help me.

36:59.980 --> 37:02.847
You are responsible for Carter
Wright being on death row.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.986
It's your responsibility
to correct that mistake.

37:06.020 --> 37:07.089
You're not getting
on a plane.

37:07.120 --> 37:11.329
You're going to write an
affidavit to that effect now.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.884
You just need
a moment to realize

37:12.930 --> 37:14.989
that this is
the right thing to do.

37:15.030 --> 37:17.794
Why don't I give you
that moment?

37:26.010 --> 37:27.602
MODERATOR (on TV):
Thank you, Mr. Florrick.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.699
Good, I got that part.
What time do we have?

37:29.740 --> 37:30.934
We've got 20 minutes.

37:30.980 --> 37:32.504
Kalinda is rushing
the affidavit.

37:32.550 --> 37:33.539
We've got the addendum here.

37:33.580 --> 37:35.013
You just take care
of the preamble.

37:35.050 --> 37:36.017
Got it.

37:36.050 --> 37:37.517
I will phone him in a minute.

37:37.550 --> 37:38.710
Tell him it's on its way.
Are you phoning Diane?

37:38.750 --> 37:42.049
Yes, I'm... Let me call you
right back. You taking off?

37:42.090 --> 37:44.422
Yeah, unless you got some
floors that need sweeping.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.352
GRACE:
Mom, come in here.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.698
They're talking
about you.

37:48.730 --> 37:50.357
Mr. Florrick, the question
isn't about the past;

37:50.400 --> 37:52.595
(volume increasing):
it's about the future.

37:52.630 --> 37:54.530
Well, I'm here to
talk about policy.

37:54.570 --> 37:56.435
I'm here to talk about
the future of Chicago,

37:56.470 --> 37:58.700
so if you have any
questions about policy,

37:58.740 --> 38:00.628
I-I'd be happy
to answer them.

38:00.670 --> 38:01.773
But isn't_that
hypocritical?

38:01.810 --> 38:03.675
I mean, you sell yourself as
a happily married candidate.

38:03.710 --> 38:05.473
So I ask you again, sir:

38:05.510 --> 38:08.377
has your wife forgiven
you for your infidelity?

38:08.420 --> 38:09.648
Mom, are you coming?

38:10.650 --> 38:12.641
MODERATOR:
Mr. Florrick?

38:14.120 --> 38:15.348
Sir?

38:15.390 --> 38:16.789
My marriage is none of your...

38:16.820 --> 38:18.048
Mom !_
...your busmess.

38:24.930 --> 38:28.093
Sir, are you aware of
what you just said?

38:28.130 --> 38:30.030
Yes, I am.

38:30.070 --> 38:32.038
Do you have any
more questions?

38:34.070 --> 38:36.038
Yep, it's me.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.640
My dad swore on TV.

38:38.680 --> 38:39.806
Oh.

38:39.850 --> 38:41.044
Nothing?

38:41.080 --> 38:42.172
Nope.

38:42.220 --> 38:45.644
Will said he'd phone when
they tell us the decision.

38:45.690 --> 38:48.045
Look, you get back
to your life.

38:48.090 --> 38:49.489
I'll wait.

38:49.520 --> 38:51.579
No, this is my life.

38:51.630 --> 38:52.585
(phone rings)

38:52.630 --> 38:53.949
That's Will.

38:53.990 --> 38:55.025
Hello.

38:55.060 --> 38:56.652
JASON:
Mrs. Florrick?

38:56.700 --> 38:58.053
Yes.

38:58.100 --> 38:59.499
This is Jason Kerrigan

38:59.530 --> 39:01.395
with the Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals.

39:01.440 --> 39:03.396
I have Judge Jerry Glendon
with a question for you.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.407
Do you have a minute?

39:04.440 --> 39:05.737
Uh, yes, I do.

39:05.770 --> 39:06.737
Please hold.

39:06.770 --> 39:08.408
(whispering):
Get Will.
Why?

39:08.440 --> 39:09.429
It's Judge Glendon.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.404
(phone rings)
Yeah, it's Will.

39:13.450 --> 39:15.145
KALINDA:
Judge Glendon
just phoned Alicia.

39:15.180 --> 39:17.068
He what?

39:17.120 --> 39:18.041
Yeah, just now.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.082
She's on the phone
waiting for a question.

39:20.120 --> 39:21.485
This is Judge Glendon.

39:21.520 --> 39:22.612
Who am I speaking to?

39:22.660 --> 39:24.059
Alicia Florrick,
Your Honor.

39:24.090 --> 39:25.057
Thank you for taking my call.

39:25.090 --> 39:26.057
You have a second?

39:26.090 --> 39:27.978
Yes, um, of course I do.

39:28.030 --> 39:31.761
It's just, um,
I'm a second-year associate.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.995
I just delivered
the addendum-- actually,

39:34.030 --> 39:35.668
not even the addendum--
I delivered the first a...

39:35.700 --> 39:37.167
Shut up,
shut up. You.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.430
I'm sorry, this is
the number I was given.

39:39.470 --> 39:41.506
Jason, am I supposed
to be talking to somebody else?

39:41.540 --> 39:43.770
Actually, I'm sorry,
Your Honor.

39:43.810 --> 39:46.108
I can answer
your questions.

39:46.150 --> 39:47.606
WILL:
Kalinda, what's going on?

39:47.650 --> 39:49.641
Shh, she's still on
the phone with him.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.079
GLENDON:
I'm reading the new affidavit

39:51.120 --> 39:53.543
from this arson expert
Dr. Grossman,

39:53.590 --> 39:55.808
and he seems to have left
a window to this being...

39:55.860 --> 39:57.111
let's see...

39:57.160 --> 40:00.049
An accidental fire,
yes, Your Honor.

40:00.090 --> 40:02.627
He's asking if it was
an accidental fire.

40:02.660 --> 40:04.093
Tell her to push for innocence.

40:04.130 --> 40:05.495
And you talked to him today?

40:05.530 --> 40:06.565
Dr. Grossman?

40:06.600 --> 40:08.636
One of my associates did...

40:08.670 --> 40:09.466
(mouthing)
...and

40:09.500 --> 40:12.560
I talked to him,
of course, after that.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.134
So my question is this.

40:14.170 --> 40:17.731
Well, actually, you know what
I'm going to ask you, don't you?

40:22.250 --> 40:25.583
Yes, I do, Your Honor.

40:25.620 --> 40:27.918
He's innocent.

40:27.950 --> 40:29.952
Carter is innocent.

40:31.860 --> 40:33.521
Look, I can order a new trial;

40:33.560 --> 40:34.356
I can deal with the heat.

40:34.390 --> 40:36.051
But why should I trust
this doctor

40:36.100 --> 40:37.988
if he so easily changed
his mind?

40:38.030 --> 40:40.590
Because he didn't
so easily change his mind.

40:40.630 --> 40:42.734
He changed his
mind in the face

40:42.770 --> 40:44.761
Of a man's innocence.

40:46.810 --> 40:50.678
So much _of what we do is
uncertain, Your Honor.

40:50.710 --> 40:55.079
So much of my day is working
between right and wrong.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.718
But this has to be right.

40:58.750 --> 41:01.753
To do this to a man...

41:01.790 --> 41:04.111
it has to be right.

41:06.260 --> 41:08.626
Thank you, ma'am.

41:08.660 --> 41:09.695
Good night.

41:09.730 --> 41:11.721
(hangs up)

41:14.300 --> 41:16.860
You did good.

41:18.970 --> 41:21.939
You did.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.129
Trust me.

41:33.850 --> 41:36.489
Got the paperwork
from the court.

41:51.940 --> 41:53.931
Dad.

42:09.590 --> 42:11.182
REPORTER:
And just hours
before his scheduled execution,

42:11.220 --> 42:12.323
Seventh Circuit Judge

42:12.360 --> 42:16.228
Jerry Glendon called for a stay
of execution of Wright.

42:16.260 --> 42:18.319
It is expected
that his case will be retried.

42:18.360 --> 42:20.328
Ten years ago,
Wright was convicted

42:20.370 --> 42:22.736
of the first-degree murder
of his wife Carolyn.

42:22.770 --> 42:24.761
Since that time,
Wright's execution

42:24.810 --> 42:26.209
has resisted numerous appeals.

42:26.240 --> 42:27.264
(turns off TV)

42:31.240 --> 42:33.208
ZACH:
You see Dad?

42:33.250 --> 42:35.218
I did.

42:35.250 --> 42:37.070
He swore on TV.

42:37.120 --> 42:38.075
I know.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.189
It was cool.

42:39.220 --> 42:40.744
NISA: Congratulations,
Mrs. Florrick.

42:40.790 --> 42:43.179
Zach told me
about your appeal.

42:43.220 --> 42:44.255
Thank you.

42:44.290 --> 42:46.656
I want to be a lawyer, too.

42:46.690 --> 42:47.850
International law.

42:47.890 --> 42:48.857
That sounds great.

42:48.900 --> 42:50.094
I want to get
an earring, Mom.

42:50.130 --> 42:52.325
(laughs)

42:52.370 --> 42:53.598
No, I'm serious.

42:53.630 --> 42:55.291
Just, just one ear.

42:55.340 --> 42:57.262
Where's Grace?

42:57.300 --> 42:58.335
In her room.

42:58.370 --> 43:00.565
Brad Pitt has
an earring In one ear.
