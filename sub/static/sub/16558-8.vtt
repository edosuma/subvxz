37:36.004 --> 37:39.257
We were to stay focused,

37:39.257 --> 37:42.090

just mannequins.

37:43.842 --> 37:46.224
So, what changed?

37:46.224 --> 37:48.146
One afternoon,
I was in the O.R.,

37:48.146 --> 37:50.519
and we lost a patient
on the table,

37:50.519 --> 37:53.101
and I went along
to inform the family,

37:53.101 --> 37:56.395
you know,
tell them the horrible news,

37:56.395 --> 37:59.398
and I was numb.

37:59.398 --> 38:03.281
I watched them sob
and hold each other and --

38:03.281 --> 38:05.454
and it didn't affect me...

38:05.454 --> 38:08.327
at all.

38:08.327 --> 38:09.868
That patient died
from the same thing

38:09.868 --> 38:12.501
my mother died from,

38:12.501 --> 38:14.122
and I was a robot.

38:16.915 --> 38:20.088
After that...

38:20.088 --> 38:24.182
I started
changing the rules,

38:24.182 --> 38:26.765
and it made me
a better surgeon.

38:26.765 --> 38:30.389
We've all hit that point
of exhaustion,

38:30.389 --> 38:33.021
the point where
nothing makes sense anymore.

38:35.273 --> 38:37.025
You've saved her now...

Good night, Meredith.

Good night.

38:53.912 --> 38:56.585
Your body hurts,
your brain becomes foggy,

38:56.585 --> 38:58.917

you're trapped in a tunnel...

39:01.339 --> 39:04.423

is your bed.

39:04.423 --> 39:08.226
So...how do you keep going?
