WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:02.400
I can not believe!

00:02.512 --> 00:05.442
My Captain Jim Bob Sherwood
Farmhouse Space Command Module

00:05.476 --> 00:07.485
was appraised
at 400 dollars!

00:07.520 --> 00:11.787
Yeah, but then you fainted and
squashed one of the space cows.

00:11.821 --> 00:15.312
Now it just looks
like space road kill.

00:17.710 --> 00:19.607
Hey, guys!

00:19.641 --> 00:22.537
I was just cleaning out the basement
and I found some cool stuff.

00:22.571 --> 00:25.233
Justin, here's your scooter.
Weren't you looking for it?

00:25.267 --> 00:27.632
Yeah, when you hid it
from me when I was eight.

00:32.896 --> 00:36.160
My old Shaun
Cassidy poster!

00:37.793 --> 00:41.325
Who put lipstick on...?
Oh, yeah!

00:42.825 --> 00:43.924
Never mind.

00:43.958 --> 00:45.957
Hey, Dad, isn't this yours?

00:45.991 --> 00:49.290
Oh! My football phone.

00:49.324 --> 00:52.124
Wait a minute. Why would you
be cleaning out the basement?

00:52.158 --> 00:53.524
You don't clean
out anything.

00:53.559 --> 00:56.524
What are you up to?
Come on, tell me.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.326
Nothing. Nothing.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.727
I just...

01:01.761 --> 01:04.958
I just think that in
these tough times,

01:04.992 --> 01:09.026
families have forgotten
what really matters.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.826
And I'll tell you
what really matters.

01:14.027 --> 01:15.960
Each other.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.494
And do you know how
we celebrate each other?

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.030 --> 01:34.398
With tokens from our
past... Memories.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.898
- Nice!
- No way.

01:38.933 --> 01:42.499
Best performance by a
daughter in a nonsense role!

01:42.534 --> 01:44.233
That was amazing!

01:56.038 --> 01:57.472
Chihuahua!

01:58.739 --> 02:01.872
Ah, now we get the truth.
Her own art studio.

02:03.307 --> 02:05.907
Alex, you think you can
clear out the basement

02:05.941 --> 02:08.574
and make it your own
space without asking us?

02:09.943 --> 02:11.677
My old yearbook!

02:11.711 --> 02:13.744
Who wants to
see my old hair?

02:13.778 --> 02:15.878
Sick, Dad! Is that
where you keep it?

02:17.747 --> 02:19.280
This is just another
one of her decoys

02:19.315 --> 02:21.615
so no one will stop her
from getting the basement.

02:22.149 --> 02:23.149
Look at her!

02:26.818 --> 02:29.619
See? Decoy.

02:29.653 --> 02:32.953
She knows that someone else is
more deserving of the basement,

02:32.988 --> 02:36.422
someone with a very valuable
Captain Jim Bob Sherwood collection

02:36.456 --> 02:39.823
that should be kept in a temperature
constant environment. Just sayin'.

02:40.492 --> 02:42.125
Hold on right there.

02:42.159 --> 02:44.359
- No one is getting the
basement. - That's right.

02:44.394 --> 02:47.994
This is where we keep all the stuff that
we don't let each other keep upstairs.

02:52.365 --> 02:53.831
Knock it off!

03:50.602 --> 03:52.769
Harper, what happened?

03:52.803 --> 03:56.638
Did you wear your walnut hat near the
park? Did the squirrels attack you?

03:58.772 --> 04:01.906
No. I'm moving.

04:03.642 --> 04:06.608
- What? - What do you
mean you're moving?

04:06.643 --> 04:08.843
My dad got transferred
to Pittsburgh.

04:08.877 --> 04:12.746
Harper, you're my best friend.
You can't leave. What about school?

04:12.781 --> 04:16.249
I would stay and finish school if
we had family in town, but we don't.

04:16.283 --> 04:19.452
I mean, we do, but they
won't tell us where they live.

04:21.588 --> 04:24.190
Well, we're your family, too.

04:24.224 --> 04:27.092
That's right, Harper.
We're here for you.

04:27.126 --> 04:29.393
Because you're
always here for us.

04:29.428 --> 04:32.462
Always here...
Always.

04:35.799 --> 04:38.434
Hey, you know
what we should do?

04:38.468 --> 04:41.069
We should let Harper
move into the basement.

04:41.104 --> 04:44.406
It would be great
for me! Us. Her.

04:44.440 --> 04:48.276
Really? Well, let me ask
my mom for permission.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.812
Mom, you were right.

04:52.847 --> 04:55.281
They did ask.
Okay, bye.

04:57.817 --> 05:00.084
She said yes.
Group hug!

05:01.486 --> 05:03.821
You and your mom
manipulated us.

05:05.156 --> 05:07.224
Looks like you are
part of this family.

05:11.495 --> 05:14.030
Well, if you're gonna be
a part of this family,

05:14.064 --> 05:16.165
you should know that
we don't group hug.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.768
It's already
feeling like home.

05:24.507 --> 05:26.174
This is so heavy.

05:32.814 --> 05:35.115
This is gonna be
so great, Harper!

05:35.149 --> 05:39.719
I know. Two best friends living
together, sharing the load.

05:41.588 --> 05:42.855
It'll be great.

05:42.889 --> 05:45.324
So, my easel is here.

05:45.358 --> 05:46.992
And my paints
are right there.

05:47.026 --> 05:49.194
And my canvases
are up here.

05:49.228 --> 05:51.329
Oh, and Harper...

05:53.598 --> 05:57.068
You can sleep
in the corner...

05:57.102 --> 06:00.738
Behind the water
heater. Warm and cozy.

06:04.542 --> 06:06.910
Really? Oh, yeah!

06:06.944 --> 06:11.347
You need your art studio more than I need
a comfortable bed... or breathable air.

06:11.381 --> 06:15.017
I'll just sleep on a towel
or possibly standing up,

06:15.051 --> 06:16.551
like a horse!

06:18.954 --> 06:22.122
Yeah, no, that'd be great. As long
as you don't take up too much room.

06:22.156 --> 06:25.191
No, I'm trying to tell you
that you're being selfish.

06:25.226 --> 06:29.495
Harper, I'm letting you sleep in
my art studio. How is that selfish?

06:30.630 --> 06:33.198
- Alex!
- Okay, I'm sorry.

06:33.233 --> 06:34.766
I'm sorry.

06:34.801 --> 06:37.769
I'm really glad you're gonna
be living here, Harper.

06:37.804 --> 06:41.573
Now come on, let's clear out all
of my stuff and set up your room.

06:42.107 --> 06:43.508
Let me know
when you're done.

06:45.143 --> 06:47.311
Just kidding!
Sorry! Yeah.

06:49.614 --> 06:53.516
Hey, isn't this your old
dollhouse we used to play with?

06:53.850 --> 06:56.051
It looked so much bigger
when we were little.

06:56.086 --> 06:58.320
Yeah. Man.

06:59.789 --> 07:02.456
If only at age five
I knew I was a wizard

07:02.490 --> 07:05.192
I would have shrunk
myself down and...

07:10.863 --> 07:15.400
Oh, no! Did you
just go "hmm"?

07:17.469 --> 07:18.735
Yes, I did, Harper.

07:18.770 --> 07:21.805
And I wish you would stop
being so afraid of my "hmms".

07:21.839 --> 07:25.141
One of these days my "hmm"
is gonna be something great.

07:25.176 --> 07:26.876
Let's see if it's today.

07:28.679 --> 07:30.413
Do we have to?

07:32.915 --> 07:35.283
Shrinka dink, shrinka
dank, shrinka dunk.

07:38.419 --> 07:40.052
I guess we do.

07:44.191 --> 07:48.226
This is my best "hmm" yet.
My very own art studio.

07:48.260 --> 07:51.161
To make teeny-tiny
art?! Cool.

07:51.195 --> 07:53.996
Hey, if I stick my toes in the
window can you paint my nails?

07:55.299 --> 07:57.967
Won't it look weird if
someone walks in and sees you?

07:58.502 --> 08:00.770
They'll mostly be
looking at this anyway.

08:03.774 --> 08:07.376
Jerry, take 'em off.
I'm throwing them out.

08:12.782 --> 08:15.049
But what if I want
to go to the gym?

08:15.084 --> 08:18.986
What if I want to stop being
embarrassed in this neighborhood?

08:19.020 --> 08:21.588
Fine. Then you
have to throw out

08:21.622 --> 08:24.223
those love poems
about Shaun Cassidy.

08:24.258 --> 08:27.793
- Who snitched?
- A little birdie told me.

08:27.828 --> 08:31.597
Excuse me, I'm more like
an eagle or a hawk.

08:31.632 --> 08:33.631
Caw! Wait.

08:33.667 --> 08:36.034
I just told you I was
the snitch, didn't I?

08:37.570 --> 08:40.504
I'll find my own
punishment.

08:40.539 --> 08:43.140
Hey, Dad, can I borrow
those pants and a camera?

08:45.009 --> 08:46.743
That was a
good one, honey.

08:50.214 --> 08:52.582
Justin...

08:52.617 --> 08:55.351
I'm no expert about
collectible toys.

08:55.386 --> 08:57.553
Thank goodness for that.

08:58.889 --> 09:01.356
But shouldn't you store
that away somewhere?

09:01.391 --> 09:06.060
Dad, two things. One, you're terrible
at making side comments to yourself.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.862
And two,
I've decided to sell

09:08.897 --> 09:11.664
my Captain Jim Bob Sherwood
Farmhouse Space Command Module.

09:11.699 --> 09:13.499
- Why?
- Because the other person

09:13.533 --> 09:15.100
shouldn't hear
your side comment.

09:15.135 --> 09:17.036
Turning your head to the side,
not lowering your voice...

09:17.070 --> 09:19.104
No. Why are
you selling it?

09:19.139 --> 09:21.173
I know I would.

09:26.913 --> 09:29.414
I'm selling it because...
I still heard that.

09:31.249 --> 09:34.718
I don't have the temperature
constant basement to store it in.

09:34.752 --> 09:38.854
Keeping it just wouldn't
be fair to the plastic.

09:39.188 --> 09:40.822
Oh, we have a customer!

09:42.525 --> 09:44.393
Nice sweatshirt.

09:46.394 --> 09:47.995
See, now that was
a good side comment

09:48.029 --> 09:50.063
because he didn't
hear you. Good.

09:51.533 --> 09:54.467
- Are you Randy?
- Yeah, I'm Randy.

09:54.501 --> 09:56.868
I heard your side comment
about my sweatshirt.

10:01.673 --> 10:03.140
I'll get it!

10:06.544 --> 10:08.344
Well, here it is.

10:08.379 --> 10:12.414
"Immaculate condition", as
described in my auction ad.

10:12.449 --> 10:17.052
Oh, which also says,
"appraised for 300 dollars".

10:18.288 --> 10:20.489
I'll give you
75 dollars for it.

10:21.123 --> 10:25.293
Seventy-five
dollars?! Cute.

10:25.327 --> 10:27.695
I should charge you 75
dollars just for looking at it.

10:27.729 --> 10:30.163
Well, it is obvious
that somebody fell on it

10:30.198 --> 10:32.098
and squashed
the space cows.

10:33.634 --> 10:37.503
Call me when you wake
up from your dream.

10:37.537 --> 10:41.639
Yeah, well, your Captain Jim Bob
sweatshirt's an iron-on, not an original!

10:43.375 --> 10:47.977
Yeah! Some people just
don't understand fashion.

10:59.457 --> 11:03.258
Harper, I love your
new bedroom, but...

11:03.292 --> 11:05.126
Aren't these
headless mannequins

11:05.161 --> 11:07.428
gonna freak you
out at night?

11:07.463 --> 11:10.664
Yeah, I put heads on
them before I go to bed.

11:10.699 --> 11:13.467
I should probably go get those before
my dad takes them to Pittsburgh

11:13.501 --> 11:15.001
instead of
taking my mom.

11:15.036 --> 11:17.470
He likes them better
'cause they don't talk back.

11:20.540 --> 11:22.974
Okay, well, I'll be
in my art studio.

11:25.944 --> 11:28.412
Shrinka dink, shrinka
dank, shrinka dunk.

11:40.557 --> 11:41.957
Harper's room
looks great.

11:43.091 --> 11:44.559
A pretzel dress.

11:51.367 --> 11:53.902
This dress could use
a little more salt.

11:55.771 --> 11:58.439
Come on, we still got a
lot of stuff to throw out.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.974
Oh, look!

12:01.008 --> 12:03.909
It's Alex's
old dollhouse.

12:03.944 --> 12:06.378
So many memories.

12:06.412 --> 12:08.313
We can get rid
of that, too, huh?

12:09.347 --> 12:10.915
Wait! Harper!

12:10.949 --> 12:13.051
Harper! Wait!

12:14.220 --> 12:15.620
Wait!

12:22.459 --> 12:24.393
Oh, no!

12:27.809 --> 12:30.677
- Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Russo.
- Hi, Olive.

12:30.711 --> 12:32.311
How's your dad's
produce stand?

12:32.345 --> 12:35.580
Fine, thank you.
Oh, Mr. Russo,

12:35.614 --> 12:38.616
here's your bag of corn
husks you use for lettuce.

12:40.985 --> 12:42.686
She's so cute.

12:44.388 --> 12:48.624
That's a really pretty dollhouse,
Mrs. Russo. Is it yours?

12:48.658 --> 12:52.660
Mine? Oh, no, honey.
It's Alex's.

12:52.695 --> 12:54.962
She's too old now, so
we're gonna get rid of it.

12:57.532 --> 12:59.499
Really? May I have it?

12:59.534 --> 13:01.168
Oh, of course!

13:01.202 --> 13:03.003
And you know what?

13:03.037 --> 13:05.806
It comes with a carrying
strap. Here you go.

13:08.510 --> 13:10.577
Thank you so much!

13:10.612 --> 13:14.047
Oh, you can't have that.
It's Alex's. But that's all yours.

13:16.117 --> 13:19.386
Harper, I know you and Alex loved
playing with this when you were little,

13:19.421 --> 13:21.722
but don't you want
someone else to enjoy it now?

13:24.058 --> 13:25.258
No.

13:26.727 --> 13:29.762
Harper, we already
gave it to Olive.

13:37.336 --> 13:41.173
Can I at least look inside of it?
You know, for sentimental reasons.

13:46.444 --> 13:49.880
Harper, I dropped my wand
and it rolled out the door

13:49.914 --> 13:52.282
when we were in the basement.
I'm in so much trouble.

13:52.316 --> 13:55.484
I'll go get Justin.
Come on, Senorita Kitty!

13:55.519 --> 13:57.820
Get Justin? Why?

14:01.224 --> 14:04.092
Because he loved
this dollhouse, too.

14:04.127 --> 14:05.694
Harper!

14:07.096 --> 14:08.363
Don't go ask
Justin for help.

14:08.397 --> 14:10.131
I'm gonna try to
fix this myself.

14:10.165 --> 14:14.369
Now, please go and try to find my wand.
It's somewhere in the basement. Hurry!

14:14.403 --> 14:17.439
And remind me to always go to the
bathroom before I come in here.

14:23.277 --> 14:25.645
Justin! Justin!
I need your help!

14:27.080 --> 14:29.248
I have to concentrate.
I'm trying to restore

14:29.283 --> 14:32.448
my Captain Jim Bob Sherwood Farmhouse
Space Command Module's space cows

14:32.483 --> 14:35.448
to bring it back to its
full 400 dollars value.

14:39.653 --> 14:43.989
- Now steady...
- Just gimme that!

14:44.024 --> 14:46.692
Harper! What are you
doing? No, you're not...

14:46.726 --> 14:48.527
Wow, it's perfect!

14:50.229 --> 14:51.829
You're really
good at that.

14:51.863 --> 14:55.332
I paint mountain scenes on grains
of rice. Of course I'm good at it.

14:55.367 --> 14:58.470
Now listen, Alex turned her old
dollhouse into an art studio,

14:58.504 --> 15:00.138
and shrunk herself
to work in it,

15:00.172 --> 15:02.841
but your mom and dad gave it to
a little girl down the street.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.943
Just tell her to use her
wand to reverse the spell.

15:04.977 --> 15:07.412
Oh, I left out a part.

15:07.446 --> 15:11.348
She lost her wand in the basement.
I looked everywhere. I can't find it.

15:11.383 --> 15:14.885
Okay, I'll go.
I'll fix it.

15:14.919 --> 15:18.688
Oh, I kinda left
out another part.

15:18.723 --> 15:21.791
I wasn't supposed
to ask for your help.

15:21.826 --> 15:25.027
- What? - She wants to
fix this on her own.

15:25.061 --> 15:27.696
But, come on, you and I
both know she can't fix this.

15:27.730 --> 15:29.897
So, are you gonna help
me help her or not?

15:30.466 --> 15:32.233
Okay, okay...

15:32.268 --> 15:33.768
I'll do both.

15:33.803 --> 15:35.771
I'll help her by
not helping her.

15:35.805 --> 15:38.040
If I don't help her, it will
make her a better wizard.

15:38.074 --> 15:41.845
So, I'm not gonna help her.
Which will help her.

15:44.982 --> 15:46.649
What?!

15:46.684 --> 15:49.484
If you weren't so darn cute,
I'd be mad at you right now.

15:49.519 --> 15:51.452
Harper...

16:02.163 --> 16:04.331
Look what I found
under my bed.

16:04.365 --> 16:08.235
A very valuable
collector's item.

16:08.269 --> 16:11.704
Max, that's a paper plate
piled high with trash.

16:13.274 --> 16:17.543
Yeah, I had it appraised.
Now it's worth 250 dollars.

16:18.612 --> 16:21.513
Who would pay you
250 dollars for that?

16:22.749 --> 16:24.749
This bargain
hunter right here.

16:26.351 --> 16:28.819
I mean, unless someone
was willing to pay 260

16:28.853 --> 16:31.186
then I would go to 275.

16:31.221 --> 16:33.222
Max, why would you
bid against yourself

16:33.256 --> 16:35.223
on something
you already own...

16:35.258 --> 16:39.360
- A bidding war!
- Sold. You owe me 275.

16:44.432 --> 16:45.632
Where is it?

16:48.002 --> 16:50.103
I know you're in here.

16:52.106 --> 16:54.640
Your hair is
so tangled!

16:54.675 --> 16:56.842
Maybe we should
just cut it all off

16:56.877 --> 16:58.677
and glue some yarn on.

17:00.813 --> 17:04.448
Hi, Olive.
How are you?

17:05.849 --> 17:09.719
Fine. Are you gonna try
and take my dollhouse?

17:11.589 --> 17:13.021
I'm sorry about that.

17:13.057 --> 17:16.858
Why don't we
be friends

17:16.893 --> 17:20.328
and maybe we can schedule
one of those "play dates"?

17:20.363 --> 17:22.396
Really? I have
to ask my mom

17:22.431 --> 17:25.800
because she told me to stay
away from the weird girl.

17:27.667 --> 17:29.535
Well...

17:29.570 --> 17:31.704
Maybe she meant
someone else.

17:31.738 --> 17:35.407
Aren't you the one who wears
a hat made of walnuts?

17:38.878 --> 17:41.713
Well, I did what
you said, Randy.

17:41.747 --> 17:46.216
I thought about your offer, and
75 dollars sounds pretty good.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.284
Then we have a deal.

17:48.318 --> 17:50.719
That we do.

17:50.754 --> 17:55.557
Because 75 dollars...
Sounds pretty good.

17:56.091 --> 18:00.027
Giant dog who waterskis,
you've done it again.

18:01.963 --> 18:06.532
- Seventy-five dollars! - Oh,
hey! Is that a Colonel Jim Bob...

18:06.566 --> 18:10.901
- Captain! - Captain
Jim Bob Sherwood...

18:10.936 --> 18:13.436
Barnyard
Command Module?

18:13.470 --> 18:15.571
Oh! Well, it's
in great shape.

18:15.605 --> 18:18.940
- Are you selling it? - Yeah, but
I just bought it for 75 dollars.

18:18.975 --> 18:21.043
Really?
I'll pay you more.

18:21.077 --> 18:25.279
- A hundred dollars. - Hey, hey!
We were making a deal here.

18:25.314 --> 18:27.447
Yes, we were, but now
there's someone else here

18:27.482 --> 18:30.385
offering 100 dollars.

18:32.256 --> 18:33.723
- One-twenty-five.
- One-fifty.

18:33.758 --> 18:35.592
Do I hear
175, 75, 75?

18:35.626 --> 18:38.595
- One-seventy-five. - 175.
Signal with the index.

18:38.629 --> 18:40.730
- One-seventy-five is the
current offer. - Two hundred.

18:40.764 --> 18:42.031
- Two hundred...
- Two-fifty!

18:42.066 --> 18:43.866
- Two-seventy-five!
- Slow down, boys.

18:43.900 --> 18:47.369
- You want to bait the bidder... Three
hundred dollars! - Three-ninety-five!

18:48.204 --> 18:50.137
You can't find my wand?

18:50.172 --> 18:52.907
Can't you see what
Olive is doing to me?

18:52.941 --> 18:55.141
I know, and I'm
kind of jealous.

18:55.176 --> 18:57.543
I've been trying for years to get
you to wear a pretty dress like that.

18:57.577 --> 19:02.481
She is pulling all of my hair
out with her cat's brush!

19:03.850 --> 19:06.284
The dress is bad enough. I
don't want to be a bald doll!

19:06.319 --> 19:10.288
Look, I really tried to
figure this out on my own,

19:10.322 --> 19:12.022
but I just don't
know what to do.

19:12.057 --> 19:14.490
You're gonna have
to ask Justin for help.

19:14.525 --> 19:17.960
Right. About that,

19:17.994 --> 19:20.095
I kind of already did.

19:20.129 --> 19:22.964
I told you not to!

19:24.568 --> 19:28.505
But I guess you knew I couldn't
figure this out on my own, right?

19:28.539 --> 19:31.575
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay. You're right.

19:31.609 --> 19:33.443
So what's Justin
gonna do to help me?

19:33.477 --> 19:36.112
Nothing. He said he's helping
you with your wizard studies

19:36.146 --> 19:37.580
by not helping you.

19:37.614 --> 19:39.315
Apparently he thinks you
can fix this on your own

19:39.350 --> 19:41.518
and, man, is he
alone in that.

19:43.521 --> 19:46.523
He actually thinks
I can fix this on my own?

19:49.761 --> 19:52.797
What kind of jacked double-reverse
psychology is he pulling?!

19:52.831 --> 19:54.966
Where is he?

19:55.000 --> 19:58.803
He just sold his Captain Jim Bob
Sherwood Farmhouse Space Command Module.

19:58.837 --> 20:01.373
Apparently a guy paid
a lot of money for it.

20:04.143 --> 20:07.747
So... Justin's
got money?

20:09.149 --> 20:11.151
Well, then he's
about to help me

20:11.185 --> 20:13.220
whether he likes
it or not.

20:14.755 --> 20:19.457
I can't believe you're gonna buy
my dollhouse for so much money!

20:22.061 --> 20:23.962
I can't believe it either!

20:26.198 --> 20:30.134
But it has a lot of,
sentimental value.

20:30.869 --> 20:32.837
It's practically family.

20:39.777 --> 20:41.778
You owe me a
lot of allowances.

21:07.299 --> 21:10.433
Thank goodness
I'm me again!

21:10.468 --> 21:14.136
Well, a gross
version of me.

21:14.170 --> 21:17.906
Wait! Don't change until I get my
giant teddy bear and my tea set.

21:20.542 --> 21:23.244
Kitty, it's gonna be
an all-girl tea party!

21:29.816 --> 21:31.483
Well...

21:32.585 --> 21:33.851
Thank you, Justin.

21:33.885 --> 21:35.652
I will pay you
back the money.

21:35.687 --> 21:37.720
No, you won't.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.321
I know, but the
"thank you" was real.

21:40.656 --> 21:43.191
Wait! Where
are you going?

21:43.226 --> 21:46.094
This is the part where we
fight it out until I win.

21:46.128 --> 21:49.998
I lost 400 dollars.
You already won.

21:50.032 --> 21:53.934
No! I won because I wanted
to fix this on my own,

21:53.968 --> 21:56.202
but I couldn't
until you made me.

21:56.236 --> 22:01.173
And, now, I'm a
better wizard for it.

22:01.207 --> 22:04.942
No, it was my
money. I fixed it.

22:04.977 --> 22:07.811
But it was my idea.
This isn't about the money.

22:07.846 --> 22:11.881
The important thing is,
that it's all better now.

22:11.915 --> 22:15.183
So you can say
"You're welcome".

22:15.218 --> 22:18.619
For what? I'm
out 400 dollars!

22:19.853 --> 22:22.723
There you go! There's the
fight I was looking for.

22:23.524 --> 22:24.791
Don't you feel better?

22:27.861 --> 22:30.630
Fine.

22:30.964 --> 22:33.398
Oh, Justin,
you're hurting me.

22:33.433 --> 22:37.068
Yeah. I do feel better
now. Thank you.

22:41.198 --> 22:44.333
Three hundred eighty,
three hundred ninety...

22:44.367 --> 22:46.801
Four hundred dollars.

22:46.835 --> 22:48.369
Well, Olive, there you go.

22:48.403 --> 22:51.238
Your very own collectible
plate of garbage.

22:54.875 --> 22:56.809
So you ended up
with all of my money?

22:56.843 --> 23:00.410
You should've bought the plate of
collectible garbage when you had the chance.

23:01.445 --> 23:03.479
Come on, man!
I'll buy you a sandwich.

23:03.513 --> 23:05.414
You don't even know how
to spend the money right!

23:05.448 --> 23:07.083
We get sandwiches for free!
