WEBVTT

00:30.698 --> 00:33.950
I busied myself to think of a story...

00:34.118 --> 00:38.496
...which would speak
to the mysterious fears of our nature...

00:38.706 --> 00:42.959
...and awaken thrilling horror.

00:43.127 --> 00:48.464
One to make the reader
dread to look around.

00:48.632 --> 00:53.970
To curdle the blood,
and quicken the beatings of the heart.

01:46.064 --> 01:51.027
Tell the captain,
we've got to take in the topsail.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.780
She's going to rip!

01:58.327 --> 02:02.747
Please, captain!
We have to drop the sails!

02:02.915 --> 02:04.874
All hands to the mast!

02:05.042 --> 02:07.168
Take the wheel! Come on!

02:11.590 --> 02:16.052
Captain, we've hit the ice!
We've hit the ice!

02:16.220 --> 02:19.222
Iceberg ahead!

02:24.603 --> 02:26.562
Hard to starboard!

02:31.735 --> 02:33.194
Go back!

02:53.632 --> 02:55.591
Help! Help!

02:57.261 --> 02:59.929
-Help!
-Hold on, Vernon!

03:01.223 --> 03:02.431
Hold on!

03:23.787 --> 03:26.956
Put your backs into it, men!

03:27.791 --> 03:28.833
Let's go!

03:29.001 --> 03:31.836
Captain, this is useless.
The ice stretches for miles.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.297
What do you suggest we do?
Lay down and die?

03:34.464 --> 03:37.091
The men are exhausted, sir.
They can't go on, man.

03:37.259 --> 03:40.678
I tell you, I have not come this far
to give up now.

03:41.263 --> 03:43.306
They knew the risk
when they signed on.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.809
And we are gonna chop our way
to the North Pole if we have to.

03:46.977 --> 03:50.313
Then you run the risk of mutiny,
captain.

03:51.899 --> 03:54.525
-Did you say mutiny?
-Yes I did, sir.

03:56.820 --> 04:01.824
We proceed north as planned.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.619
At the cost of how many more lives?

04:04.786 --> 04:07.330
As many as it takes!

04:21.511 --> 04:23.512
There's something out there.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.349
What is it?

04:31.563 --> 04:33.522
What the hell is that?

05:01.218 --> 05:02.760
Who is your captain?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.887
I am.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.223
Who the devil are you?

05:08.058 --> 05:09.892
I've no time to talk.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.479
You bring your men and your weapons
and follow me.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.942
-Now!
-Stay where you are.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.194
I give the orders here.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.243
Get the dogs! Get them!

05:28.370 --> 05:29.745
Leave them.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.249
They're already dead.

05:45.429 --> 05:47.596
Get back to the ship now!

05:47.764 --> 05:50.057
Everybody back to the ship!

05:52.894 --> 05:55.104
Bears don't kill like that, nothing does.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.273
Maybe it wants the man
with the captain.

05:57.441 --> 06:00.317
-Or it wants the captain.
-The devil's come for the captain.

06:00.527 --> 06:05.156
For the last time, I made my way from
St. Petersburg to Archangel on foot.

06:05.323 --> 06:12.038
From there I took a whaling ship north.
When we hit the ice, I used the dogs.

06:17.919 --> 06:19.754
What's out there?

06:24.468 --> 06:29.430
Listen to me. I have spent six years
planning this, my entire fortune.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.975
I will not be stopped by you
or some phantom.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.687
Do you share my madness?

06:37.981 --> 06:41.942
-No, not madness.
-What, then?

06:44.112 --> 06:48.699
There's a passage to the North Pole,
and I will find it.

06:48.867 --> 06:51.869
At the cost of your own life?
The lives of your crew?

06:52.079 --> 06:54.622
Lives come and go.

06:55.207 --> 07:00.169
If we succeed,
our names will live on forever.

07:00.337 --> 07:05.341
I will be hailed
as the benefactor of our species.

07:05.509 --> 07:07.384
You're wrong.

07:08.303 --> 07:11.680
I, of all men, know that.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.891
Who are you?

07:15.519 --> 07:17.853
My name...

07:19.356 --> 07:21.482
...is Victor...

07:23.110 --> 07:25.528
...Frankenstein.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.211
Mother!

07:43.630 --> 07:46.215
Oh, my wonderful son Victor!

07:46.383 --> 07:49.760
You are the handsomest, kindest,
cleverest...

07:49.928 --> 07:54.056
...most wonderfulest boy
in the whole world!

07:56.393 --> 07:59.061
Madam! You will spoil the boy, really.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.531
Would you two leave us, please,
Mrs. Moritz?

08:10.699 --> 08:11.740
Doctor.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.077
Come along, Justine.

08:17.414 --> 08:22.459
Victor, this is Elizabeth.
She's coming to live with us.

08:22.669 --> 08:28.924
She's lost both her mother and father
to the scarlet fever, Victor.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.926
She's an orphan now.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.053
You must think of her
as your own sister.

08:35.765 --> 08:40.059
You must look after her,
and be kind to her.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.440
Always.

08:57.579 --> 09:01.123
Mother, oh.
How is the imminent arrival?

09:01.291 --> 09:04.001
Oh, a little frisky today.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.680
When you were a little boy,
you used to chase fireflies in the field.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.308
Yes, and when I trapped them
in my jar, they died.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.685
-And do you remember how you cried?
-Yes.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.939
Because you wanted to keep them
glowing by your bedside...

09:25.106 --> 09:26.857
...to light you as you read.

09:27.025 --> 09:31.278
You were so hungry for knowledge.
Such a serious little boy.

09:33.865 --> 09:36.825
You've become
such an earnest young man.

09:37.535 --> 09:43.290
All these strange and ancient books.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.836
You'll be an even greater doctor
than your father.

09:50.340 --> 09:55.261
But you know, Victor,
life shouldn't be all study.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.013
There's such fun to be had.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.350
-Give me that back.
-No.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.143
Give me that back, Mother.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.238
Change partners. And twirl!

10:14.406 --> 10:15.864
-Now, Caroline.
-You're right.

10:16.032 --> 10:18.826
-You mustn't exert yourself. Please.
-I know.

10:18.994 --> 10:22.413
Don't worry, madam. Your new baby
will be a natural dancer.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.331
Excellent.

10:26.543 --> 10:29.545
You'll be the envy
of all the young ladies and gentlemen.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.008
Justine.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.677
Justine, may I have this dance?

10:42.392 --> 10:44.393
-Madam!
-Hurry!

10:46.313 --> 10:47.730
You must make a decision!

10:47.897 --> 10:50.190
How can I?
The baby's in the wrong position.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.943
I can't proceed.... I can't....

10:55.113 --> 10:57.906
Cut me. Save the baby.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.250
She'll be all right.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.587
Your father's the finest doctor
in Geneva.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.847
Father?

11:23.725 --> 11:25.351
Father?

11:27.395 --> 11:29.355
Father, how is she?

11:30.106 --> 11:34.818
I did everything I could....
Everything I could....

11:34.986 --> 11:38.280
Mother? Mother!

11:59.427 --> 12:01.595
Bring her back.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.599
Please, bring her back.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.809
No!

12:06.976 --> 12:10.896
Please, bring her back.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.013
Oh, Mother.

12:45.682 --> 12:51.186
You should never have died.
No one need ever die.

12:51.855 --> 12:54.356
I will stop this.

12:55.525 --> 12:57.651
I will stop this.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.362
I promise.

13:01.322 --> 13:05.242
Victor, you're completely obsessed.
Please explain what that is.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.245
It's energy. It never disappears,
it merely changes form.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.497
It's possible to convert
this candle wax...

13:10.665 --> 13:12.833
...into the convulsions
of a mechanical dog.

13:13.001 --> 13:17.713
But the applications of this
are limitless. Really.

13:17.881 --> 13:21.425
Oh, please come outside, Victor.
It's such a beautiful day.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.969
Go away, I'm busy.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.850
What's this?

13:30.393 --> 13:32.978
It's for spraying down the electric eels.

13:34.564 --> 13:37.858
Now, put it down. Put it down.
It's not for playing with.

13:38.026 --> 13:41.403
It's not for playing with. Put it down,
put it down-- Don't do that.

13:41.571 --> 13:45.240
I warned you. Don't-- Don't--
Give me that, you little....

13:47.243 --> 13:50.120
Come on!

13:54.792 --> 13:56.210
Come on!

13:56.377 --> 13:58.086
We should be grateful to Victor...

13:58.254 --> 14:00.756
...for abandoning his experiments
for one afternoon.

14:00.924 --> 14:03.425
Well, who says I have?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.260
What do you mean?

14:05.428 --> 14:06.595
Look!

14:06.763 --> 14:08.597
We're all going to die.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.933
-You knew this would happen.
-Not for certain.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.311
But I had hoped the conditions
would be right. They're common here.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.897
I've never seen one quite as large,
though. Look.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.900
-Isn't it wonderful?
-Victor, you shouldn't have done this.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.568
It's all right, it's all right.

14:21.736 --> 14:25.155
-We must take cover. A tree!
-That's exactly the wrong thing to do.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.449
It's a much larger conductor
than we are.

14:27.617 --> 14:28.951
Victor, what about Willie?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.912
-What are we to do?
-Come on.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.831
Spread out.
Elizabeth, take this. Now, quickly.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.168
-Come on, quickly!
-What is that?

14:39.128 --> 14:41.129
Dig it right into the ground. Go ahead.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.465
-Now what?
-Justine, take this. Come on.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.468
-Willie!
-Everyone down.

14:47.845 --> 14:51.682
Give me your hands. It'll be fine.
Now take him. Now, that's good.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.517
I hope you know
what you're doing.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.144
-Willie? Willie, don't look up!
-Willie.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.980
-Victor--
-Wait!

14:58.147 --> 15:01.358
One, two, three....

15:11.160 --> 15:12.828
Now.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.221
So how do you feel, Elizabeth?

15:33.182 --> 15:34.850
Alive.

16:05.173 --> 16:09.635
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends.
Gather round and listen.

16:10.178 --> 16:13.722
As you probably know,
tomorrow my dear son Victor...

16:13.890 --> 16:16.600
...leaves me to pursue,
what I'm sure...

16:16.768 --> 16:19.227
...will be an illustrious career
in a profession...

16:19.395 --> 16:21.438
...I am not altogether
unassociated with.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.233
Oh, modesty.

16:28.404 --> 16:31.239
My one regret is that his mother...

16:32.408 --> 16:37.079
...my late wife, is not here...

16:39.582 --> 16:43.377
...to share the pride...

16:45.254 --> 16:47.923
...which our son fills me with tonight.

16:52.095 --> 16:53.679
Yes.

17:00.103 --> 17:03.939
She wanted you to have this, Victor.
On your graduation.

17:05.900 --> 17:08.734
And in it she has written:

17:11.446 --> 17:14.616
"This is the journal
of Victor Frankenstein."

17:18.121 --> 17:20.329
The rest of the leaves are blank...

17:22.916 --> 17:26.086
...to be filled with the deeds
of a noble life.

17:51.863 --> 17:55.615
We'd better go in,
before they miss us.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.160
Just a little while longer. Please.

18:00.455 --> 18:02.789
I don't know when we'll be
alone together again.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.460
Oh, dear Victor.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.463
I shall miss you laughing at me.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.675
I'll miss you making me laugh.

18:27.064 --> 18:29.858
So how do brothers and sisters
say goodbye?

18:34.071 --> 18:35.697
Perhaps they never have to.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.534
I won't, if you won't.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.677
Are you my sister?

18:59.514 --> 19:01.223
Sister...

19:01.849 --> 19:03.725
...friend...

19:04.519 --> 19:06.603
...lover.

19:08.606 --> 19:10.565
Wife?

19:11.400 --> 19:12.567
Yes.

19:12.735 --> 19:15.028
Then come with me to Ingolstadt.
Marry me now.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.405
-Victor, no.
-Well, then I'll stay.

19:18.825 --> 19:23.578
I want more than anything else
in the world to be your wife.

19:23.746 --> 19:27.332
But as long as you're away,
I belong here.

19:28.543 --> 19:31.086
I want to make this house live again.

19:31.254 --> 19:35.257
I want to make this
a great home for our children.

19:36.217 --> 19:40.637
And now you must go, and do
the great things you need to do.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.890
I want you so much.

19:45.268 --> 19:47.978
I'll be here when you return.

19:48.479 --> 19:53.149
Each holiday. Every visit.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.781
Then on our wedding night.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.961
Until our wedding night.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.652
Lots of stairs, I'm afraid.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.864
-How was your journey?
-Good, thanks. I made good progress...

20:41.032 --> 20:42.991
-...over the mountains.
-I am pleased.

20:43.159 --> 20:48.163
-As I said, we've only got attic space.
-It's exactly what I'm looking for.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.665
But Frau Brach,
there will be a great deal...

20:50.833 --> 20:53.460
...of scientific equipment and rigging
to be delivered.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.671
Every day, for the next week.
I trust you have no objections.

20:56.839 --> 21:00.175
I'm sure you appreciate the need
for a proper laboratory.

21:00.343 --> 21:02.177
Oh, Putzi likes you.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.562
This will be perfect.

21:15.691 --> 21:20.570
"The foolish and vain
force their views by the rod.

21:20.738 --> 21:25.158
But knowledge is power
only through God."

21:25.326 --> 21:30.705
Our motto. Easily forgotten
by you young men in a hurry.

21:33.084 --> 21:39.881
But perhaps the greatest mistake
that all students make...

21:40.049 --> 21:43.551
...during their time here,
is to suppose...

21:43.719 --> 21:48.723
...that they can ever have
an original or creative thought.

21:50.393 --> 21:54.854
We have all imagined that
in our time.

21:59.986 --> 22:04.739
But gentlemen, you have not come
here in order to think for yourselves.

22:04.907 --> 22:09.744
You are here to learn
how to think for your patients.

22:09.912 --> 22:12.706
You must learn, therefore,
in the first place...

22:12.873 --> 22:15.291
...to submit yourselves...

22:15.501 --> 22:20.422
...to the established laws
of physical reality.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.881
But surely, professor...

22:23.718 --> 22:26.928
...you don't intend we disregard
more philosophical approaches?

22:27.096 --> 22:28.430
Philosophical?

22:29.557 --> 22:34.060
Those which stir the imagination as
well as the intellect, as in Paracelsus.

22:34.228 --> 22:38.523
Paracelsus.
An arrogant and foolish Swiss.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.275
Albertus Magnus?

22:40.443 --> 22:45.405
His nonsense was exploded
500 years ago.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.282
Cornelius Agrippa?

22:47.450 --> 22:50.452
A sorcerer. An occultist.
What is your name?

22:51.454 --> 22:55.915
Victor Frankenstein, sir. Of Geneva.

22:57.585 --> 22:59.085
Another Swiss.

22:59.253 --> 23:04.591
Mr. Frankenstein, here at
the University of Ingolstadt, we teach--

23:04.759 --> 23:07.677
And indeed, hope to advance.
--the science of medicine.

23:07.845 --> 23:12.265
Chemistry, biology, physics.
We study hard science.

23:12.433 --> 23:16.269
Surely, the greatest possible advances
lie in combining these things.

23:16.437 --> 23:19.481
We do not study the ravings
of lunatics and alchemists...

23:19.648 --> 23:22.317
...hundreds of years in their graves...

23:22.818 --> 23:28.114
...because their kind of amateur,
fanatical, fantastical speculation...

23:28.282 --> 23:31.201
...does not heal bodies or save lives.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.661
Only science can do that.

23:37.208 --> 23:42.087
Now, have we your permission
to continue?

23:45.174 --> 23:48.009
-Nice coat.
-Why, thank you.

23:48.177 --> 23:49.344
Don't take it too hard.

23:49.512 --> 23:51.679
Krempe doesn't approve
of public humiliation.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.641
-I am not mad!
-My dear fellow, of course you're not.

23:54.809 --> 23:58.019
In fact, that's just what I'd expect
a perfectly rational person...

23:58.187 --> 24:00.563
...to say to a complete stranger.

24:00.731 --> 24:04.317
Henry Clerval, by the way,
and I'm completely crazy.

24:04.485 --> 24:06.361
-Victor Frankenstein.
-Of Geneva.

24:06.529 --> 24:08.196
-Of Geneva.
-Yes, I noti--

24:08.364 --> 24:10.865
Why don't you look where I'm going?

24:12.701 --> 24:15.036
That's Schiller.
Ornament of the playing field.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.538
-Really.
-He's new as well.

24:16.705 --> 24:20.250
You can tell because he goes around
looking at things with his mouth open.

24:21.752 --> 24:23.711
What are you here for?

24:24.505 --> 24:26.548
-Research.
-Very grand.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.883
I'm here to become a mere doctor.

24:29.051 --> 24:31.344
I'm told it has something to do
with healing the sick.

24:31.512 --> 24:34.848
Which is a pity, really, because
I find sick people rather revolting.

24:35.015 --> 24:38.393
Still, I'll have a good time,
get my degree--

24:38.561 --> 24:40.353
If I can stop failing Anatomy.

24:40.521 --> 24:44.107
--and settle down to relieve rich
old ladies of their imaginary ailments...

24:44.275 --> 24:47.360
...and then relieve their very real
and beautiful daughters.

24:47.528 --> 24:50.905
-Who was that? He was at the lecture.
-That's Waldman.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.407
-That's Waldman.
-Yes.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.909
Interesting case.
They say in his youth...

24:55.077 --> 24:57.745
...he could break into heaven
and lecture God on science.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.248
Ran into trouble with the authorities
years back.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.750
Something to do
with illegal experiments.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.545
But what kind of experiments,
I wonder?

25:05.713 --> 25:09.924
So what was it you were saying?
Rich old ladies and their daughters?

25:10.092 --> 25:14.262
Yes, it's a life of sacrifice, I know,
but someone's got to do it.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.154
And that is why
the central nervous system...

25:31.322 --> 25:33.489
...and its crowning achievement,
the brain...

25:33.699 --> 25:36.284
...are as complicated and mysterious
a set of organs...

25:36.452 --> 25:38.661
...as you are ever likely to encounter.

25:38.829 --> 25:42.790
Mr. Frankenstein,
the incision is yours.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.964
Excellent.

25:50.132 --> 25:54.594
Mr. Clerval,
you may remove the cranial lid.

25:58.307 --> 26:01.935
"Henry, now fully recovered, continues
his struggle to pass Anatomy."

26:02.102 --> 26:03.686
I was always terrible at anatomy.

26:03.854 --> 26:07.315
"Professor Waldman is very tolerant
of us. I'm learning a great deal."

26:07.483 --> 26:10.193
-Professor Waldman is remarkable.
-And so is Henry.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.195
"God bless you, all my love, Victor."

26:12.363 --> 26:14.530
-That's very nice.
-"P.S. I've fallen in love."

26:14.740 --> 26:16.032
I beg your pardon?

26:16.242 --> 26:18.785
"She's dark, sleek, and beautiful...

26:18.953 --> 26:21.663
...and always wags her tail
whenever she sees me.

26:21.830 --> 26:26.501
Her name is Putzi, and she's the
friendliest sheepdog that I've known."

26:29.004 --> 26:33.341
"P.S. Elizabeth,
I dream of how your hair shines...."

26:33.509 --> 26:36.552
"Of how your lips taste.
I dream of your arms and breasts...

26:36.762 --> 26:38.346
...and of the time
on our wedding night...

26:38.514 --> 26:41.307
...when we will be alone
together at last."

26:41.475 --> 26:42.892
What else does it say?

26:43.060 --> 26:46.187
It says, "I'm working very hard
to make lots of new friends."

26:46.355 --> 26:48.147
More coffee, anyone?

26:50.776 --> 26:57.031
Once and for all, Frankenstein!
Life is life, death is death.

26:57.533 --> 26:59.033
These things are real.

26:59.201 --> 27:01.869
-They are absolute.
-That is rubbish and you know it!

27:02.037 --> 27:05.039
That premise has been repeatedly
challenged by your own staff!

27:05.207 --> 27:08.167
Yes, you, sir! We don't know
where life ends or death begins.

27:08.335 --> 27:12.046
Hair continues to grow after what we
choose to call death. So do fingernails.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.340
We know that a man's brain may die...

27:14.508 --> 27:17.385
...but his heart and lungs may
continue to pump and breathe.

27:17.553 --> 27:18.761
Now, you know that.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.431
Mr. Frankenstein of Geneva,
I warn you...

27:21.598 --> 27:26.102
...what you are suggesting is not only
illegal, it is immoral.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.812
Rubbish!

27:29.523 --> 27:35.695
"Dear diary, why does no one
understand me? P.S. I am not mad."

27:36.613 --> 27:38.072
You.

27:39.116 --> 27:41.576
-Explain yourself.
-Professor, I'm sorry.

27:41.744 --> 27:44.412
Listen, I came here to learn
all about the new science.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.622
About galvanism,
Franklin's experiments.

27:46.832 --> 27:49.625
Combination of modern disciplines
with ancient knowledge...

27:49.835 --> 27:52.086
-...to protect and create--
-To create what?

27:54.048 --> 27:57.383
Sir, we can change things. We can
make things better. You know that.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.927
We are on the verge
of undreamed-of discoveries...

28:00.095 --> 28:04.932
...if we only have the courage to ask
the right questions. You must help me.

28:07.353 --> 28:09.437
Come on.

28:09.605 --> 28:12.648
-Victor....
-Come on.

28:20.783 --> 28:22.408
Henry.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.091
Lock the door.

28:43.514 --> 28:45.681
Now, for thousands of years...

28:45.891 --> 28:48.976
...the Chinese have based
their medical science on the belief...

28:49.144 --> 28:53.314
...that the human body is a chemical
engine run by energy streams.

28:53.482 --> 28:57.402
-Fascinating. How do they explain--?
-Don't touch that!

28:58.695 --> 29:00.655
Their doctors treat patients...

29:00.823 --> 29:03.991
...by inserting needles like these
into the flesh...

29:04.159 --> 29:07.495
...at various key points,
to manipulate these electric streams.

29:07.663 --> 29:08.830
I see.

29:08.997 --> 29:11.499
So electricity is the key.

29:11.834 --> 29:15.169
Now, look at this.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.436
Go on, touch it.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.025
-It feels warm.
-It is.

29:39.570 --> 29:42.196
Yes. How do you do?

29:44.741 --> 29:46.075
Turn it off!

29:46.243 --> 29:48.744
-I can't, it's not working.
-Try to stay calm, Henry.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.164
Simply a matter
of reducing the polarity.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.499
A monkey's arm is basically
the same as ours.

29:53.667 --> 29:56.085
-No arm is this strong!
-Now, this must work.

30:03.385 --> 30:06.345
Let me help you, professor.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.516
You shall, of course, tell no one.

30:12.269 --> 30:15.104
They wouldn't believe you anyway.

30:20.402 --> 30:25.364
Dearest Victor.
Nothing much changes here.

30:25.866 --> 30:31.078
Mrs. Moritz continues to love and
torment Justine, in equal measure.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.206
Willie grows more precocious
every day...

30:33.373 --> 30:35.374
...and Father almost expires
with pride...

30:35.542 --> 30:37.585
...at the very thought of you
and your work.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.253
And I....

30:39.421 --> 30:44.383
Well, I just miss you, very much.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.636
Please write soon, Victor.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.889
No, I'm serious.
You take vaccine, for instance.

30:50.057 --> 30:53.100
Thirty years ago the entire concept
of vaccine was unheard of...

30:53.268 --> 30:55.144
...and now we save lives every day.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.813
-But that isn't the whole answer.
-What do you mean?

30:58.023 --> 31:01.943
That sooner or later the best way
to cheat death will be to create life.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.653
Now you've gone too far.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.739
-There's only one God, Victor.
-No, leave God out of it.

31:06.907 --> 31:09.450
If you loved someone,
they had a sick heart...

31:09.618 --> 31:12.578
...wouldn't you give them a healthy
one? It's not impossible.

31:12.746 --> 31:14.247
We can do it, we're steps away.

31:14.414 --> 31:17.667
If we can replace one part of a
human, we can replace every part.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.752
And if we do that,
we can design a life.

31:19.920 --> 31:22.838
We can create a being
that will not grow old or sicken.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.299
One that's stronger than us,
better than us.

31:25.467 --> 31:28.010
One more intelligent than us,
more civilized than us.

31:28.178 --> 31:31.180
-In our lifetime?
-No.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.979
How close did you get, professor?

31:38.146 --> 31:39.355
Too close.

31:42.818 --> 31:45.027
Professor, I beg you,
let me see these notes.

31:45.195 --> 31:47.822
No. My work now,
and its application...

31:47.990 --> 31:51.951
...lies exclusively
in the preservation of life.

31:52.119 --> 31:55.204
I abandoned my other researches
many years ago.

31:55.372 --> 31:56.455
Why?

31:58.292 --> 32:01.377
Because they resulted in abomination.

32:21.315 --> 32:24.734
You're not sticking that in me.
It's got a pox in it, I hear.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.485
-Pox? They've given us pox?
-Pox.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.864
It's not pox, it's a vaccine
that will prevent plague in this city.

32:30.032 --> 32:32.366
-What's that?
-It's a tiny, harmless amount...

32:32.534 --> 32:35.161
-...of anti-smallpox serum.
-You just said pox!

32:35.329 --> 32:36.829
I said it was harmless.

32:36.997 --> 32:40.249
It's a necessary precaution,
without which this godforsaken city...

32:40.417 --> 32:42.585
...would be immediately
put under quarantine.

32:42.753 --> 32:46.547
You doctors kill. I don't care what
you say. You're not sticking that in me.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.716
Yes, I am. It's the law!

32:48.884 --> 32:53.012
-Sit him down, someone.
-You're not sticking that in me!

32:53.180 --> 32:55.139
You're not sticking that in me!

32:56.892 --> 33:00.144
-Sir?
-Professor? Sir?

33:02.147 --> 33:03.898
Find him!

33:04.900 --> 33:08.402
Come on! Come on! Come on!

33:09.029 --> 33:10.696
It's no use, Victor, he's gone.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.406
-No! No, Henry!
-Let him go!

33:12.574 --> 33:16.243
-No! No, this shouldn't happen!
-Let him go! Victor, stop!

33:16.411 --> 33:18.537
-It shouldn't happen!
-Stop!

33:18.705 --> 33:23.709
It need not happen!

33:30.384 --> 33:32.218
The hell with you!

33:33.303 --> 33:38.808
Whatever you say, whatever you
call it, you doctors are killers.

33:39.601 --> 33:43.938
You murder people!
Evil! You're evil!

33:44.439 --> 33:45.815
Evil!

33:45.982 --> 33:52.613
You're the ones that deserve to die.
God will punish you. He'll punish you!

33:52.781 --> 33:55.950
God will punish you!

34:10.297 --> 34:14.969
My God, you were so close!
Of course, the power!

34:15.137 --> 34:19.806
The materials were wrong.
You needed auxiliary sources.

34:19.975 --> 34:23.768
"The experiment a failure.

34:23.937 --> 34:29.817
Resulting reanimant
malformed and hideous to behold.

34:29.985 --> 34:34.321
This factor dependant on the
appropriate raw materials."

34:39.119 --> 34:40.953
Raw materials....

35:00.182 --> 35:02.183
-Come on, Henry.
-I can't help you, Victor.

35:02.350 --> 35:06.020
-You won't. What are you afraid of?
-Everything! What if the authorities--?

35:06.188 --> 35:10.816
We'll do this in secret. I've got the raw
materials, I've got Waldman's journals.

35:10.984 --> 35:13.861
-You stole his journals?
-We owe it to him to complete this.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.197
-He was one step away.
-He never wanted this.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.032
Couldn't face it, that's different.

35:18.366 --> 35:22.036
Even if it were possible,
and even if you had the right--

35:22.204 --> 35:24.872
Which you don't.
--to make this decision for us...

35:25.040 --> 35:28.083
...can you imagine there wouldn't
be a terrible price to pay?

35:28.293 --> 35:30.753
I think for the chance
to defeat death and disease...

35:30.921 --> 35:33.547
...to let everyone on Earth
have the chance at life...

35:33.715 --> 35:35.382
...sustained, healthy life...

35:35.550 --> 35:40.596
...to allow people who love each
other to be together forever....

35:40.806 --> 35:45.017
For all of that,
I think it's a risk worth taking.

36:03.870 --> 36:07.248
Please, Justine, just leave me alone.
I won't talk about it.

36:08.124 --> 36:11.252
But all these letters,
you read them to us every week.

36:11.419 --> 36:15.589
I wrote them. I wrote the letters.
He hasn't written to me in months.

36:15.757 --> 36:16.799
Elizabeth....

36:16.967 --> 36:20.135
Something horrific is happening
to him. I can feel it.

36:20.345 --> 36:23.430
At first I wasn't sure,
but I knew I had to hide it from Father.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.891
Now there are rumors of cholera.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.936
I can look after Father and Willie.
You go to Ingolstadt--

36:29.104 --> 36:32.565
That's not possible. He won't want me.
He's probably found someone else.

36:32.732 --> 36:36.068
If he was mine,
I would have gone already.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.779
But he isn't mine.

36:38.947 --> 36:43.617
He's yours, and you must go to him.

36:58.466 --> 37:01.135
Raw materials, that's all they are.

37:02.304 --> 37:04.638
Tissue to be re-used.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.773
The very finest brain.

37:26.953 --> 37:29.538
-But they all died of cholera, sir.
-No matter.

37:29.706 --> 37:31.165
Thank you.

37:39.049 --> 37:43.969
The assembled organs must have
the appropriate nutrients and heat...

37:44.137 --> 37:49.016
...and crucially, more direct power.

37:52.562 --> 37:55.522
More direct power.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.421
Amniotic fluid is the
chief biogenic element.

38:19.589 --> 38:22.883
The subject is injected with this.
The copper acupuncture needles...

38:23.051 --> 38:25.052
...are inserted at key energy points.

38:25.220 --> 38:29.056
Now, after the removal of current,
the dead toad should retain animation.

38:29.224 --> 38:33.352
But independently
of external power sources.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.737
Yes.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.739
That's it.

38:46.616 --> 38:49.618
That's the combination.
That's the combination!

38:49.786 --> 38:51.245
That's it!

39:55.685 --> 39:58.353
Victor? Victor!

39:58.605 --> 39:59.813
Victor, open the door!

40:01.649 --> 40:03.525
-Victor, please!
-What do you want?

40:03.693 --> 40:05.778
There's cholera. It's an epidemic!

40:06.362 --> 40:09.031
The city's been placed
under martial law.

40:09.199 --> 40:12.159
-Are you listening to me, Victor?
-Yes. And?

40:12.327 --> 40:14.495
The militia's arriving
to quarantine the city.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.830
Most of us are getting out
while we still can.

40:17.499 --> 40:20.667
Krempe knows you're here.
What if he tells the authorities?

40:20.835 --> 40:23.128
Goodbye, Henry.

40:23.296 --> 40:25.547
Victor, it's me.

40:25.715 --> 40:27.841
Elizabeth.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.221
Can you hear me?

40:33.306 --> 40:35.349
Victor, I have to see you.

40:37.143 --> 40:40.187
-Go away.
-Please, Victor!

40:43.191 --> 40:46.527
I won't leave here until you see me.

40:53.243 --> 40:55.410
Come in the side door.

40:57.539 --> 40:59.206
Alone!

41:12.387 --> 41:13.679
What's happened to you?

41:16.224 --> 41:18.725
How can you live here like this?

41:19.769 --> 41:21.228
And that stench.

41:21.396 --> 41:23.397
Don't go in there!

41:28.069 --> 41:31.530
-We have to leave. It isn't safe.
-No, I have to stay.

41:32.198 --> 41:35.951
-Even if it means you'll die?
-Yes.

41:47.881 --> 41:49.548
Well, let me help you.

41:50.091 --> 41:53.594
No, that's impossible.

41:57.432 --> 41:58.807
We made a promise.

42:06.065 --> 42:08.233
Victor, I beg you.

42:12.113 --> 42:16.491
Look, I know that this
is difficult for you to understand...

42:16.701 --> 42:21.622
...but I cannot abandon this work
now.

42:22.081 --> 42:28.253
It is too important. Not just for me,
but, believe me, for everyone.

42:31.299 --> 42:36.220
And it must come first.

42:40.141 --> 42:42.267
Before us?

42:46.814 --> 42:49.107
Elizabeth...

42:49.817 --> 42:53.820
...I love you so much, but....

43:05.667 --> 43:07.251
Goodbye.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.777
Elizabeth! Elizabeth!

43:37.365 --> 43:39.491
Oh, God! Elizabeth!

43:39.659 --> 43:41.368
Elizabeth!

45:41.155 --> 45:43.949
Live! Live! Live!

45:44.117 --> 45:45.700
Live!

45:48.496 --> 45:49.496
Yes!

46:07.306 --> 46:08.932
No....

46:09.225 --> 46:11.184
No!

46:12.520 --> 46:14.688
No!

46:15.231 --> 46:18.400
No!

46:18.568 --> 46:20.652
No!

46:36.836 --> 46:38.712
It's alive.

46:41.090 --> 46:42.257
It's alive.

48:29.782 --> 48:30.865
No.

48:53.681 --> 48:55.515
What have I done?

49:01.314 --> 49:04.149
What have I done?

49:15.828 --> 49:19.831
"Massive birth defects.

49:20.875 --> 49:25.879
Greatly enhanced
physical strength.

49:26.047 --> 49:31.551
But resulting reanimant...

49:32.053 --> 49:36.222
...is malfunctional...

49:36.390 --> 49:38.558
...and pitiful...

49:39.852 --> 49:43.855
...and dead."

49:47.276 --> 49:52.656
Tomorrow this journal and
its secrets must be destroyed...

49:53.574 --> 49:55.575
...forever.

50:08.547 --> 50:10.465
Oh, God.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.349
No!

51:01.517 --> 51:05.979
You fool,
Victor Frankenstein of Geneva.

51:06.147 --> 51:08.106
How could you know
what you'd unleashed?

51:09.358 --> 51:15.363
How is it pieced together?
Bits of thieves, bits of murderers....

51:15.531 --> 51:19.159
Evil stitched to evil stitched to evil.

51:19.326 --> 51:24.664
Do you really believe this thing
will thank you for its monstrous birth?

51:24.832 --> 51:26.791
Evil will have its revenge.

51:28.878 --> 51:32.839
God help your loved ones.

52:48.082 --> 52:50.708
What do you think you're doing?

52:51.961 --> 52:55.630
He's got cholera! He's the one
who's been spreading the plague!

52:55.798 --> 52:57.590
Get him!

53:35.087 --> 53:36.129
Come here, you--

53:44.305 --> 53:46.431
Keep away from him.

53:46.682 --> 53:48.474
No, kill him now!

54:04.700 --> 54:06.701
He went this way.

54:55.167 --> 54:59.754
There now. Easy. Easy. Just a bit.

55:00.756 --> 55:06.761
-That's it. There, now, rest easy.
-Henry, you're here.

55:06.971 --> 55:11.891
Of course I'm here.
It was touch and go with you, though.

55:12.059 --> 55:15.603
I feared cholera,
turned out to be pneumonia.

55:15.771 --> 55:18.856
Yes, I'm becoming
something of a doctor.

55:19.024 --> 55:21.567
Even Krempe
seems pleased with me.

55:21.735 --> 55:24.988
At this rate,
I might even pass Anatomy.

55:25.197 --> 55:29.075
-The epidemic?
-Dreadful.

55:29.243 --> 55:31.411
There's nothing we can do for them.

55:31.578 --> 55:35.289
The vulnerable, anyone who's
without shelter or food...

55:35.499 --> 55:37.917
...the newborns, especially, will die.

55:38.085 --> 55:41.254
-Are you sure?
-I'm certain of it.

55:42.589 --> 55:44.757
Thank God.

55:46.427 --> 55:48.094
What do you mean?

55:55.060 --> 55:57.103
Nothing.

56:00.566 --> 56:05.069
Well then, that's my shift finished.

56:08.782 --> 56:09.949
I'll see you later.

57:02.086 --> 57:03.294
Elizabeth.

57:19.311 --> 57:20.478
Elizabeth.

57:31.865 --> 57:35.034
-Please, please, forgive me!
-Of course I do.

57:39.540 --> 57:43.584
Victor, I don't know what you're
working on, and I don't want to know.

57:43.752 --> 57:46.379
But it nearly killed you.

57:47.631 --> 57:51.551
It's over, it's finished.
It should never have started.

57:51.718 --> 57:55.054
It's dead! It's dead.

58:50.110 --> 58:51.777
-Felix!
-Yes?

58:51.945 --> 58:54.447
Don't forget the onion scraps.

58:55.449 --> 58:59.076
All right, I've got them.

58:59.244 --> 59:01.412
Go on, get.

59:01.788 --> 59:04.957
Come on. Come on.

59:05.125 --> 59:08.586
Go on, go on. Go on. Get.

59:22.601 --> 59:25.978
-How are the pigs?
-Happy they've been fed.

59:27.439 --> 59:30.358
-How are your hands?
-They're bleeding again.

59:30.776 --> 59:32.318
Let me see them.

59:39.326 --> 59:41.118
That's better.

59:46.166 --> 59:47.833
There.

59:48.835 --> 59:52.171
-The soup's ready.
-Come on, Grandpa. Sit down.

59:53.006 --> 59:54.590
Thank you.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:57.320
We'll never get through the winter
with this yield.

01:00:58.739 --> 01:01:02.575
-The ground's frozen hard.
-We'll sell another pig at market.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:07.413
We can't.
Not until they lift the quarantine.

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:11.584
Even then, it's one less for us. Last
month's rent, he'll be back for that.

01:01:11.752 --> 01:01:16.088
Come on. We'll do this together.

01:01:19.051 --> 01:01:20.885
You're right.

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:24.597
We've got to,
before the snow comes.

01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:33.731
Come on, then.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:57.755
The ground's frozen solid. We'd need
20 men to do this. It's useless!

01:01:57.923 --> 01:02:01.759
-It's getting late.
-We don't have enough to eat.

01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:05.137
We'll manage. Let's go.

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.955
Look. Look.

01:02:42.551 --> 01:02:45.678
They must be gifts
from the Good Spirit of the Forest.

01:02:45.846 --> 01:02:49.140
Father, nothing in this life
comes free of cost.

01:02:49.307 --> 01:02:55.020
-I would like to know who and why.
-Was it the Good Spirit, Grandpa?

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:59.733
-I believe it was.
-Don't fill their head with nonsense.

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:21.547
Who's there?

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:25.885
Felix? Children?

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:40.065
Right.

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:43.402
What's this one?

01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:52.912
-Friend?
-Friend! Well done!

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:55.581
That's very good.

01:03:55.749 --> 01:04:01.212
You've got lots of friends,
haven't you? Grandpa and....

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:07.426
Friend....

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:16.060
Friend....

01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:31.659
Friend.

01:04:36.957 --> 01:04:39.041
Friend.

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:43.629
Family.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:48.801
Father.

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.972
You must travel with them
for the entire journey.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:55.140
This equipment
must not be left unattended.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:58.143
My father will take delivery of them
in Geneva. Understand?

01:04:58.311 --> 01:04:59.353
I do, sir.

01:04:59.563 --> 01:05:00.980
-Going somewhere?
-Henry, look.

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:03.983
Look at this locket Victor gave me.
Isnâ€™t it beautiful?

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:07.987
-Yes, it's lovely. Is this really you?
-Yes, it's a bad likeness, I know.

01:05:08.154 --> 01:05:11.323
But for now,
it will serve instead of a ring.

01:05:11.491 --> 01:05:14.660
Congratulations
on the entirely expected!

01:05:14.828 --> 01:05:17.663
-When?
-As soon as we get home.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:21.166
We'll be there for New Year's Eve.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:24.003
-He's taking over Father's practice.
-And expanding it.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:27.172
I'm going on ahead now the
quarantine's lifted. So much to do.

01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:30.467
Now, the practice needs a partner.
Now, there's not much money...

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:34.346
...but there is food and board
and some very good company.

01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:39.852
And it's the ideal position for someone
who has finally passed Anatomy.

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:42.479
So we were wondering if...

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:45.524
...there was anybody
that you could recommend?

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:50.070
Victor, I-- I don't know what to say.

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:52.489
Well, please say yes.

01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:54.700
-Yes.
-Yes!

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:58.662
-Yes!
-Yes, yes!

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:02.625
And you can write that down
in your journal!

01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:20.559
"This is...

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:24.938
...the journal...

01:06:25.357 --> 01:06:26.774
...of...

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:30.694
...Victor...

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:35.407
...Frankenstein...

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:36.909
...of...

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:40.537
...Geneva."

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:45.959
Come on, quickly.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.587
Come on, then, off you go.
Quickly, now.

01:06:51.174 --> 01:06:53.258
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.594
Come on, now. Come on.
Time for bed.

01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:57.304
In you go.

01:07:07.107 --> 01:07:13.487
"For the Good Spirit of the Forest."

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:31.004
Are you
the Good Spirit of the Forest?

01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:34.466
Not exactly. Where's your father?

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:38.137
I said, where's your father?

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:39.471
Who's there? Maggie?

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.308
-No.
-Oh, it's you.

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.769
-What have you done to Maggie?
-Is he in there?

01:07:45.937 --> 01:07:47.855
Hiding behind a blind old man?

01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:49.940
Get away! Get away!

01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:54.987
Don't blame me.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:58.490
Blame your son
for not paying his rent on time.

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:12.755
My God.

01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:18.051
Thank you, my friend.
Thank you so much.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:22.473
Won't you come and sit by the fire?

01:08:24.392 --> 01:08:27.394
Please, don't be afraid.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:32.191
Come. Come in.

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:43.202
Have a rest, sit down.

01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:48.707
That's better.

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:53.295
I'm glad you finally came in.

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:57.381
A man shouldn't have to hide
in the shadows.

01:09:04.349 --> 01:09:08.393
Better that way, for me.

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.522
Why?

01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:16.318
People are afraid.

01:09:17.237 --> 01:09:19.904
Except you.

01:09:21.533 --> 01:09:24.076
It can't be as bad as that.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.332
Worse.

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:39.424
I can "see" you with my hands,
if you'll trust me.

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:02.155
-Papa, Papa, he hurt Grandpa!
-Who hurt Grandpa?

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:04.783
-What was that noise?
-Tell me what the noise was.

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.285
What happened, Maggie?

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.287
Poor man.

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.879
Have you no friends?

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:25.679
There are some people.

01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:33.937
But they don't know me.

01:10:34.105 --> 01:10:36.982
Why do you not go to them?

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:47.534
Because I am so very...

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.125
...ugly.

01:10:57.211 --> 01:11:03.175
And they are so very...

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:10.349
...beautiful.

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:13.018
Father! Get out of here!

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:18.982
-Get out of here, monster.
-Leave him alone!

01:11:23.196 --> 01:11:24.863
We have to leave here.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:15.747
No.

01:13:01.169 --> 01:13:05.130
I will have revenge!

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:11.094
Frankenstein!

01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:46.505
Geneva.

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:03.313
-Quickly, quickly.
-She's here, she's here!

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:05.816
-Willie!
-We got your letter!

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.901
It's the first one
I was allowed to read.

01:14:08.111 --> 01:14:10.195
Congratulations, Elizabeth.

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:13.031
-I'm happy for you.
-Thank you, Justine.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.866
Oh, is that the locket?

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:18.370
Look how handsome Victor is.

01:14:18.538 --> 01:14:21.915
-Can I take this to show Peter?
-Yes, but, Willie, it's not a toy.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:23.917
Let him go.
Don't dawdle, William!

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:35.554
Justine, you idiot. Pay attention.

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:38.431
Anyone would think
you're the one that's getting married.

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:39.933
-Yes, Mother.
-What's wrong?

01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:41.935
Nothing. Really.

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:44.938
Just leave it. You've ruined it now.

01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:16.595
No! No!

01:15:28.608 --> 01:15:31.276
Frankenstein.

01:15:33.321 --> 01:15:34.446
You, with me.

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:36.615
-Have you seen Willie?
-Isnâ€™t he back yet?

01:15:36.782 --> 01:15:39.075
Claude went
to find if he'd lost track of time.

01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:43.288
-They say he never arrived.
-Far too late for him to still be out.

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:51.129
-William!
-William!

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:53.298
-William!
-William!

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.926
Willie!

01:15:57.303 --> 01:15:59.471
Willie!

01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:08.438
Willie....

01:16:08.648 --> 01:16:10.774
Willie!

01:16:11.359 --> 01:16:13.818
This isn't a game!

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:20.325
Willie!

01:16:21.953 --> 01:16:24.162
It's so late.

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:31.544
We're all so tired. I'm so tired.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:37.968
Father! I'm so pleased to see you.

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:45.058
What's wrong?

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:07.163
William!

01:17:16.674 --> 01:17:19.092
We checked the east ridge.
There's nothing there.

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:20.719
Damn!

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.224
Elizabeth?

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:29.602
I found him!

01:17:29.812 --> 01:17:33.064
I found him!

01:17:36.027 --> 01:17:37.610
Elizabeth!

01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:41.406
No!

01:18:14.732 --> 01:18:17.400
We did everything we could, sir.

01:18:18.944 --> 01:18:23.365
You just rest easy now.
We did everything we could.

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:29.120
Sir, I'm terrified for my girl.
She's still out looking for William.

01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:34.959
We parted badly. I was cruel to her.
I didn't mean it.

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:41.800
I think she finds it hard, with your
wedding. She loves you dearly.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:44.302
I couldn't bear it if anything
happened to her.

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:47.472
She's all I've got. Please, help me!

01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:51.393
We'll organize another search
now that it's light.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:54.604
We will find her, Mrs. Moritz,
I promise.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:01.528
-How is Father?
-His heart is breaking.

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:13.498
Mr. Frankenstein...

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:18.795
...we've apprehended the murderer,
five miles from here hiding in a barn.

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:23.633
We found this on her.
It's yours, I believe, sir?

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:30.348
Sir, you must come immediately.

01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:33.017
The townspeople have gone mad.

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:38.231
-What are they doing?
-They must have broken into the jail!

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:40.191
For God's sake, can't you stop them?

01:19:40.359 --> 01:19:42.360
They've gone wild!
This is a lynching mob!

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:45.655
Stop! This is unlawful.

01:19:45.823 --> 01:19:47.532
-Justine.
-Justine!

01:19:55.875 --> 01:20:00.378
Victor! Help me!
I was trying to find him!

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:03.882
I went to the lake, but it was dark!

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:06.718
I wanted to bring him to you!

01:20:06.886 --> 01:20:13.391
He must be there for the wedding!
I'm sorry! He's so tiny.

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:51.429
We managed to close the gates
on the mob, Claude.

01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:53.765
What about Justine?

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:56.559
We've cut her down.
We can bury her in the morning.

01:20:56.727 --> 01:20:59.437
Thank you, Claude. Get to bed.

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:08.530
The sea of ice.

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.033
I will meet you there...

01:21:12.243 --> 01:21:15.411
...on the sea of ice.

01:21:34.848 --> 01:21:36.683
Oh, Justine, forgive me.

01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:42.146
Victor, tell me. Who is this man?
How do you know he's responsible?

01:21:42.314 --> 01:21:44.482
I'll tell you everything
after I destroy him.

01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:46.317
This is a matter for the police.

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:48.486
They wouldn't understand.

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:50.572
Well, neither do I.

01:21:51.824 --> 01:21:53.992
Then just accept it.

01:23:42.267 --> 01:23:43.726
Get up.

01:23:44.478 --> 01:23:45.561
Get up.

01:23:46.105 --> 01:23:47.772
You do speak.

01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:50.817
Yes, I speak.

01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:53.111
And read.

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:57.115
And think.

01:23:57.950 --> 01:24:00.243
And know the ways of man.

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:02.829
How did you find me?

01:24:07.418 --> 01:24:09.085
Your journal.

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:14.799
Then you mean to kill me.

01:24:16.719 --> 01:24:17.969
No.

01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:23.975
You murdered my brother,
didn't you?

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:30.815
I took him by the throat
with one hand...

01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:34.652
...lifted him off the ground...

01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:39.323
...and slowly crushed his neck.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:46.330
And as I killed him,
I saw your face.

01:24:50.377 --> 01:24:56.632
You gave me these emotions. But
you didn't tell me how to use them.

01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:00.678
Now two people are dead...

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.514
...because of us.

01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:07.518
Why?

01:25:09.772 --> 01:25:15.276
There's something at work in my soul
which I do not understand.

01:25:17.196 --> 01:25:20.072
What of my soul? Do I have one?

01:25:21.325 --> 01:25:25.703
Or was that a part you left out?

01:25:26.789 --> 01:25:31.042
Who were these people
of which I am comprised?

01:25:32.878 --> 01:25:35.838
Good people? Bad people?

01:25:37.049 --> 01:25:40.218
-Materials, nothing more.
-You're wrong.

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:46.224
Do you know
I knew how to play this?

01:25:47.935 --> 01:25:51.729
In which part of me
did this knowledge reside?

01:25:52.397 --> 01:25:54.357
In these hands?

01:25:55.025 --> 01:25:57.693
In this mind? In this heart?

01:25:58.529 --> 01:26:03.825
And reading and speaking.

01:26:05.244 --> 01:26:11.415
Not things learned,
so much as things remembered.

01:26:12.543 --> 01:26:15.753
Trace memories in the brain,
perhaps.

01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:22.218
Did you ever consider
the consequences of your actions?

01:26:24.847 --> 01:26:31.143
You gave me life,
and then you left me to die.

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:38.776
Who am I?

01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:40.778
You....

01:26:46.285 --> 01:26:48.286
I don't know.

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:55.084
And you think I'm evil.

01:26:57.421 --> 01:26:59.422
What can I do?

01:27:00.424 --> 01:27:04.802
There is something I want. A friend.

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.804
A friend?

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:08.931
Companion.

01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:11.475
A female.

01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:15.021
Someone like me.

01:27:16.106 --> 01:27:18.190
So she won't hate me.

01:27:18.817 --> 01:27:20.526
Like you?

01:27:22.613 --> 01:27:25.156
Oh, God,
you don't know what you're asking.

01:27:26.033 --> 01:27:29.535
I do know that...

01:27:30.329 --> 01:27:34.498
...for the sympathy
of one living being...

01:27:34.666 --> 01:27:38.419
...I would make peace with all.

01:27:41.632 --> 01:27:44.675
I have love in me
the likes of which...

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:48.930
...you can scarcely imagine.

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:56.854
And rage, the likes of which
you would not believe.

01:27:58.941 --> 01:28:03.152
If I cannot satisfy the one...

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:10.201
...I will indulge the other.

01:28:12.829 --> 01:28:19.377
And if I consent, how will you live?

01:28:22.506 --> 01:28:26.050
We would travel north,
my bride and I...

01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:30.096
...to the furthest reaches of the Pole.

01:28:30.347 --> 01:28:33.891
Where no man has ever set foot.

01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:38.854
There, we would live out our lives...

01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:41.983
...together.

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:47.989
No human eye
would ever see us again.

01:28:49.408 --> 01:28:52.284
This, I vow.

01:28:54.037 --> 01:28:59.000
You must help me. Please.

01:29:02.713 --> 01:29:06.757
If it is possible
to right this wrong...

01:29:09.094 --> 01:29:11.262
...then I will do it.

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:15.433
-Victor!
-Victor.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:17.268
Are you all right?

01:29:19.563 --> 01:29:23.441
-Yes, I'm safe. I'm safe.
-What happened?

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:25.735
Tell us.

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:29.238
Victor.

01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:34.910
Victor, you have to
tell us what happened!

01:29:35.078 --> 01:29:36.662
One month, that's all I ask.

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:40.166
And then we can be married
and we can forget this whole business.

01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:43.294
-I promise.
-Promise? Promise.

01:29:43.462 --> 01:29:45.129
Oh, don't dare use that word to me.

01:29:45.297 --> 01:29:49.008
You promised to tell me who this man
was. You promised to stop this work.

01:29:49.176 --> 01:29:51.093
-Your promises mean nothing.
-Elizabeth.

01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:53.512
-I have to leave this house.
-Where will you go?

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.015
-Somewhere I can recover.
-This is ridiculous.

01:29:56.183 --> 01:29:57.641
I haven't got time to argue.

01:29:57.809 --> 01:30:01.604
Oh, isn't it convenient?
Or doesn't it fit in with your plans?

01:30:01.772 --> 01:30:04.815
Don't you ever think
of anyone or anything but yourself?

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:18.662
God forgive me.

01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:45.082
Why her?

01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:49.879
Materials, remember? Nothing more.

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:52.423
-Your words.
-No.

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:56.635
You will honor your promise to me!

01:31:56.803 --> 01:31:58.679
I will not.

01:31:59.389 --> 01:32:00.931
Go on, kill me now.

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:03.392
That is mild
compared to what will come.

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.771
If you deny me my wedding night,
I will be with you on yours.

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:11.066
Elizabeth!

01:32:12.485 --> 01:32:14.111
Elizabeth.

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:18.407
Wait. Wait, please wait. Please.

01:32:18.575 --> 01:32:21.952
I have to speak to you. Please!

01:32:31.504 --> 01:32:33.464
What do you want to say?

01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:37.009
Don't go.

01:32:39.596 --> 01:32:44.308
Please, don't go.

01:32:50.232 --> 01:32:51.857
I'm frightened.

01:32:55.820 --> 01:32:57.488
Of what?

01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:07.456
I have done something
so terrible...

01:33:09.334 --> 01:33:12.962
...so evil.

01:33:14.673 --> 01:33:20.511
And I'm frightened
that if I tell you the truth...

01:33:22.264 --> 01:33:24.181
...that I will lose you.

01:33:26.768 --> 01:33:29.770
You'll lose me if you don't.

01:33:33.358 --> 01:33:34.900
I...

01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:39.697
...don't know...

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.701
...what...

01:33:45.578 --> 01:33:47.329
...to do.

01:34:23.742 --> 01:34:25.868
Will you marry me, Victor?

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.124
Marry me today.

01:34:34.085 --> 01:34:38.088
Tomorrow, tell me everything.

01:34:40.258 --> 01:34:43.135
But you must tell me the truth.

01:34:45.638 --> 01:34:49.433
And together, we can face anything.

01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:57.149
Whatever you've done,
whatever has happened...

01:34:58.735 --> 01:35:00.486
...I love you.

01:35:11.122 --> 01:35:17.002
To share the truth, the whole truth,
for good or ill...

01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:23.675
...to stand by each other
in sickness and in health...

01:35:24.302 --> 01:35:29.264
...and in joy,
from this day forward...

01:35:30.308 --> 01:35:33.977
...till death do you part.

01:35:50.787 --> 01:35:52.121
Who is this man, sir?

01:35:52.288 --> 01:35:54.790
-How shall we know him?
-Believe me, you'll know him.

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:58.335
He killed Master William,
and Justine Moritz died for it.

01:35:58.503 --> 01:36:01.296
No hesitation, lads.
Shoot the bastard on sight!

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:02.965
Henry?

01:36:03.133 --> 01:36:04.508
Don't worry about a thing.

01:36:04.676 --> 01:36:07.636
You two look after each other.
I'll look after your father.

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:56.059
I'm sorry, sir. The last ferry's gone.
There's nothing now till morning.

01:36:56.227 --> 01:36:59.354
-Damn.
-I'll secure you lodgings for the night.

01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:01.023
-Thank you, Claude.
-Come on.

01:37:05.236 --> 01:37:07.362
-Keep your pistols dry!
-They're dry enough.

01:37:07.530 --> 01:37:10.032
And if they fail, we've others.
And if those fail...

01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:11.783
...we can always gut the bastard.

01:37:11.993 --> 01:37:14.369
-Go to your post.
-Yes, sir.

01:37:16.789 --> 01:37:20.417
Don't worry, sir.
You're well guarded.

01:37:21.294 --> 01:37:24.087
Now, why don't you
go on upstairs to your wife?

01:37:24.255 --> 01:37:27.216
It's not often
a man has his wedding night.

01:37:52.283 --> 01:37:53.951
You're soaking.

01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:06.630
Brother and sister no more.

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:10.801
Now husband and wife.

01:39:36.179 --> 01:39:37.888
Victor?

01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:42.142
Lock the door.

01:39:44.062 --> 01:39:45.896
-Lock the door.
-Victor.

01:39:46.064 --> 01:39:48.690
I saw him in a flash of lightning.
He ran to the lake.

01:39:48.858 --> 01:39:49.941
You two stay here.

01:40:01.579 --> 01:40:03.455
We lost him.

01:40:04.749 --> 01:40:06.375
Elizabeth!

01:40:07.251 --> 01:40:09.711
Don't bother to scream.

01:40:28.106 --> 01:40:33.568
Please.... Please don't hurt me.

01:40:34.737 --> 01:40:39.616
You are lovelier than
I ever could have imagined.

01:40:41.119 --> 01:40:42.285
Elizabeth!

01:40:44.122 --> 01:40:45.288
Elizabeth!

01:40:53.923 --> 01:40:55.632
I keep my promises!

01:41:25.872 --> 01:41:27.664
For God's sake,
tell me what happened.

01:41:27.832 --> 01:41:31.042
No point. I know what I have to do.

01:41:31.252 --> 01:41:33.795
God. No, Victor! You can't do this,
I won't let you!

01:41:33.963 --> 01:41:36.214
She's gone. I love her.
What would you do?

01:41:36.382 --> 01:41:37.507
Leave her in peace.

01:41:37.675 --> 01:41:40.177
My father would have done this
for my mother.

01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:42.304
Your father's dead.

01:41:43.848 --> 01:41:45.807
Then there's nothing left to lose.

01:41:45.975 --> 01:41:48.351
Nothing but your soul.

01:43:58.441 --> 01:44:01.985
Live!

01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:05.822
No!

01:44:35.019 --> 01:44:37.020
Live. Live.

01:44:39.941 --> 01:44:42.651
Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:45:10.221 --> 01:45:12.180
Say my name.

01:45:14.392 --> 01:45:19.020
Please, say my name.

01:45:20.773 --> 01:45:25.610
Remember! You must remember.

01:45:26.612 --> 01:45:28.196
Elizabeth?

01:45:29.782 --> 01:45:31.700
Elizabeth?

01:45:38.708 --> 01:45:40.250
That's it.

01:45:42.586 --> 01:45:45.422
That's it, you remember.

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:50.802
That's it.

01:45:56.267 --> 01:45:59.644
Now, stand. Stand.

01:46:11.741 --> 01:46:15.285
Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:46:38.267 --> 01:46:40.060
You remember.

01:46:43.564 --> 01:46:45.190
You remember.

01:47:31.362 --> 01:47:33.363
She's beautiful.

01:47:36.826 --> 01:47:37.909
She's not for you.

01:47:38.202 --> 01:47:39.994
Come.

01:47:43.415 --> 01:47:45.041
Elizabeth?

01:47:46.919 --> 01:47:48.545
Say my name.

01:47:53.217 --> 01:47:54.509
Elizabeth.

01:47:57.930 --> 01:47:59.264
Yes.

01:48:02.351 --> 01:48:03.393
Elizabeth!

01:48:07.398 --> 01:48:09.232
You're beautiful.

01:48:14.405 --> 01:48:16.072
Say my name.

01:48:16.574 --> 01:48:20.243
Elizabeth, come to me.

01:48:21.036 --> 01:48:22.912
Come to me.

01:49:29.855 --> 01:49:32.315
Say my name, Elizabeth.

01:49:33.943 --> 01:49:35.485
Vic....

01:49:36.779 --> 01:49:38.655
That's right, Elizabeth.

01:49:39.823 --> 01:49:41.783
Victor.

01:49:41.951 --> 01:49:43.826
No, you're mine.

01:49:46.455 --> 01:49:48.498
You're mine.

01:49:48.666 --> 01:49:52.502
-Leave her alone! No!
-Get away from her. She's mine.

01:49:52.670 --> 01:49:55.171
She's mine! She said my name!
She remembers!

01:49:55.339 --> 01:49:56.798
She's mine!

01:50:14.358 --> 01:50:16.693
No!

01:50:50.811 --> 01:50:55.273
All that I once loved
lies in a shallow grave...

01:50:55.441 --> 01:50:58.026
...by my hand.

01:51:01.572 --> 01:51:04.866
I followed the trail he left for me--

01:51:05.909 --> 01:51:07.452
North.

01:51:08.203 --> 01:51:10.413
Always north.

01:51:11.248 --> 01:51:13.374
--for months now...

01:51:14.752 --> 01:51:16.753
...with one intent:

01:51:18.630 --> 01:51:20.465
To kill him.

01:51:23.844 --> 01:51:25.345
Now...

01:51:30.434 --> 01:51:32.268
...I'm tired.

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:43.112
I'm so very, very tired.

01:51:58.879 --> 01:52:00.797
What did he say?

01:52:02.466 --> 01:52:04.133
He's dead.

01:52:06.303 --> 01:52:11.849
He died raving
about some phantom.

01:52:12.017 --> 01:52:14.310
What is it out there, captain?

01:52:18.482 --> 01:52:22.318
He told me a story that...

01:52:25.114 --> 01:52:27.031
...couldn't be true.

01:52:28.992 --> 01:52:33.996
He was mad, I think.

01:52:37.334 --> 01:52:39.961
A warming breeze.

01:52:42.172 --> 01:52:47.677
-The ice will melt yet.
-And what then, captain?

01:52:54.017 --> 01:52:56.436
-We head north.
-No.

01:53:20.377 --> 01:53:22.462
Who are you?

01:53:26.216 --> 01:53:29.093
He never gave me a name.

01:53:56.914 --> 01:53:58.581
Why do you weep?

01:54:00.751 --> 01:54:04.253
He was my father.

01:54:06.507 --> 01:54:09.884
"And yea, I gave my heart
to know wisdom...

01:54:10.052 --> 01:54:12.929
...and to know madness and folly...

01:54:13.096 --> 01:54:19.602
...and I perceived that all is
vanity and vexation of spirit.

01:54:19.770 --> 01:54:23.940
For in much wisdom is much grief...

01:54:24.107 --> 01:54:29.111
...and he that increaseth knowledge,
increaseth sorrow.

01:54:29.279 --> 01:54:36.285
For God shall bring every work and
every secret thing into judgment...

01:54:36.453 --> 01:54:41.165
...whether it be good,
or whether it be evil."

01:54:49.466 --> 01:54:53.469
-Captain--
-He has a right to bear witness.

01:55:04.648 --> 01:55:06.107
Jesus, it's breaking up!

01:55:17.494 --> 01:55:19.620
Get back to the ship, captain.

01:55:20.497 --> 01:55:23.124
Leave the damn torch! Leave it!

01:55:26.128 --> 01:55:27.336
Come with us.

01:55:29.381 --> 01:55:31.841
I am done with man.

01:55:43.645 --> 01:55:44.729
Hang on, I've got you!

01:55:44.896 --> 01:55:47.315
Help! Help!

01:55:52.529 --> 01:55:55.197
Here, captain. Here, captain.
Quick, grab my hand!

01:57:06.228 --> 01:57:09.313
Where to now, captain?

01:57:20.992 --> 01:57:22.618
Home.
