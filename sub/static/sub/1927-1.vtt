00:07.424 --> 00:09.384
Give me your coordinates. I'll find you a safe landing site.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.763
There's not gonna be a safe landing, but I can try and force it down.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.973
I'll get Howard on the line, he'll know what to do.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.725
Peggy.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.394

Peggy.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.085
Steve?

00:45.504 --> 00:46.797
Steve?

01:02.271 --> 01:03.730
Look sharp.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.238
Zodiac is on the move,

01:11.446 --> 01:13.407
crossing the white stone bridge in a green sedan.

01:14.032 --> 01:17.077
This enemy is considered armed and extremely dangerous.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.412
Two agents recommended.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.789
Please locate and pursue.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.216
Miller, Johnson, Wilkes.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.428
Let's take them down.

01:52.988 --> 01:54.698
How are you holding up sweety?

01:55.449 --> 01:56.992
Quite bored actually.

01:57.201 --> 02:00.204
Really? I thought we were keeping you pretty busy around here.

02:00.579 --> 02:03.123
Well, while my expertise is in the field,

02:03.332 --> 02:06.293
code breaking and data analysis have always come easy to me.

02:06.502 --> 02:09.505
Well, we all just think you are doing a bang up job.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.883
Agent Flynn, sir,

02:13.091 --> 02:14.259
it's been three months now

02:14.384 --> 02:16.136
and I've yet to have be sent on my first assignment.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.346
Peggy, Relax,

02:17.554 --> 02:19.515
War is over. We'll handle the rough stuff.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.530
They shot up your car.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.532
Sir, they came out of nowhere

02:36.740 --> 02:39.117
We're gonna need a full analysis on all recent transmissions,

02:39.326 --> 02:40.661
by tomorrow evening at the latest.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.956
How about yesterday?

02:58.387 --> 02:59.471
Carter!

03:00.138 --> 03:02.391
The boys and I were heading out for a drink.

03:02.516 --> 03:06.645
You want to polish up those field reports on my desk?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.063
I appreciate it darling.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.899
Don't forget to lock up when you're done.

03:13.527 --> 03:16.113
What do you say boys, should we go to Nelson's?

03:17.573 --> 03:19.157
They got a nice Manhattans.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.472
We have a locked position on zodiac.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.434
Four, zero, point six five one eight degrees north,

03:45.517 --> 03:48.437
seven, three, point niner five two two degrees west.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.356
This enemy will not hesitate to use lethal force.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.984
3-5 agents recommended.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.627
You guys want to handle this?

04:13.837 --> 04:15.214
My pleasure.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.470
Mam, you can't be here.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.475
We got a gas leak issue we're dealing with.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.352
A gas leak? No injuries I hope.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.978
You're not from around here, are you?

04:30.187 --> 04:32.481
No, I live in Brooklyn actually.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.143
Drop it.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.564
Take this.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.232
Turn and move.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.823
Where's Zodiac?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.324
End of the hallway on the right.

05:25.826 --> 05:26.827
Drop it.

05:27.494 --> 05:28.787
Hands up.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.211
How many men?

05:37.880 --> 05:39.715
- Four. - Four including you?

05:41.592 --> 05:44.052
Now, I need you to scream for help.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.975
Help! I need help!

05:50.100 --> 05:51.393
- Guard the zodiac. - Yeah

05:51.560 --> 05:52.811
You, come with me.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.813
Help! I need help!

05:55.480 --> 05:57.524
Somebody please help me!

05:57.733 --> 05:59.026
Somebody help!

05:59.610 --> 06:00.986
What happened?

06:10.037 --> 06:12.414
Help!

06:13.081 --> 06:14.291
Help!

06:14.416 --> 06:15.375
Thanks, that's enough.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.711
One to go.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.765
Hey, what's going on out there?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.586
Let me out!

08:44.066 --> 08:45.526
Learn to count.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.736
Okay.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.933
What the hell do you think you're doing?

09:18.809 --> 09:20.769
Well, I was about to start some data analysis and code breaking.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.938
Don't get cute with me Lady.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.940
You took a mission last night.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.109
I completed a mission last night.

09:27.317 --> 09:30.279
Without even attempting to report in or get the proper authorization.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.197
The mission was time sensitive.

09:32.322 --> 09:36.785
There are protocols in place. No one is above protocols,

09:36.994 --> 09:38.787
not even captain america's old flame.

09:38.954 --> 09:40.622
How dare you.

09:40.831 --> 09:44.042
Please, let's stop pretending shall we.

09:44.168 --> 09:45.544
Everyone knows why you're here.

09:45.669 --> 09:46.628
Please enlighten me.

09:46.795 --> 09:47.504
You were grieving

09:47.546 --> 09:50.090
so they kept you on so that you would feel useful.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.676
I call it pity.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.469
If they wanted to make me feel useful

09:54.595 --> 09:56.054
they wouldn't have made me work for you.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.604
You're gonna answer for that.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.197
Who am I speaking to?

10:14.198 --> 10:15.991
This is Agent Flinn.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.618
This is Howard.

10:17.743 --> 10:20.162
Sir, I wasn't expecting...

10:20.287 --> 10:22.164
I have orders for Agent Carter.

10:22.748 --> 10:27.377
If this is about last night, rest assured she will be properly disciplined.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.129
I'd say that last night

10:29.171 --> 10:31.507
more a notch in her belt than a feather in her cap.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.258
Yes Sir, what are your orders?

10:33.383 --> 10:35.385
Phillips and I want her to come to Washington.

10:35.511 --> 10:36.762
Say again?

10:38.222 --> 10:40.849
Tell her she will be running S.H.I.E.L.D. with me.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.435
Agent Carter?

10:43.644 --> 10:45.437
- And Flinn, - Yes sir.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.607
let her know that you're honored to bring her the news.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.696
You want me to say that verbatim?

10:59.660 --> 11:00.869
Hello?

11:01.787 --> 11:03.121
Mr. Stark?

11:24.601 --> 11:28.397
Agent Carter, it is my honor to inform you that

11:28.647 --> 11:31.859
you are going to run S.H.I.E.L.D.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.528
and I'd also like to assist you in

11:34.653 --> 11:37.739
carrying your personal items down to your car.

11:44.288 --> 11:46.081
Thank you Agent Flinn,

11:46.206 --> 11:49.543
but as has always been the case, I don't require your help.

13:28.058 --> 13:29.852
It's called a bikini.

13:30.602 --> 13:31.812
A bikini?

13:34.356 --> 13:35.983
You invent it?

13:37.568 --> 13:39.111
No, the French.

13:44.533 --> 13:46.034
Bikini...
