WEBVTT

00:07.048 --> 00:08.925
Colton! Yo!

00:10.885 --> 00:12.345
Look at this spread!

00:12.846 --> 00:14.806
-I baked.
-In your Easy-Bake Oven?

00:14.889 --> 00:17.267
Yeah, hand-rolled with love.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.768
-Is this you?
-Yeah.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.980
So, like,
what was your first social setting,

00:22.772 --> 00:23.773
publicly out?

00:23.857 --> 00:25.525
Is there any regrets… Not regrets.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.902
Anything you'd do differently
publicly coming out?

00:28.486 --> 00:30.864
I mean, I definitely
have put my foot in my mouth

00:30.947 --> 00:33.199
and… and made mistakes along the way.

00:33.283 --> 00:36.286
'Cause I'm still,
like, figuring it all out.

00:36.369 --> 00:41.207
And I would be… lying
if I said my "clock" wasn't ticking

00:41.291 --> 00:44.502
now that I told my family,
I told people in my hometown.

00:44.586 --> 00:48.757
Does that kind of push you
toward wanting to come out publicly

00:48.840 --> 00:50.383
and be able to tell everybody and…

00:50.467 --> 00:52.802
Yeah.
I mean, and the answer is yes.

00:54.721 --> 00:56.389
Coming out to my friends and family,

00:56.473 --> 00:59.059
it's getting a little easier
to talk about,

00:59.142 --> 01:02.187
but now I have to start thinking
about coming out publicly.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.564
That part, to me, is terrifying.

01:04.647 --> 01:09.402
The reason why I got to where I am today,
as far as living my life so publicly,

01:09.486 --> 01:13.990
was because if I couldn't
convince myself that I was straight,

01:14.074 --> 01:17.368
I had to try to convince
America and everyone else.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.496
Now I have a lot of explaining to do,

01:19.579 --> 01:21.831
and the only person
I have to blame is myself.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.666
How are you thinking
you would want to do it?

01:25.752 --> 01:29.506
I think social media
wouldn't be the right fit,

01:29.589 --> 01:33.843
and…
I have a lot to talk about.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.178
I actually think that too.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.139
Originally, I was like,
"You should just do it on Instagram."

01:38.223 --> 01:41.142
"You already have the big platform
and a following," but…

01:42.519 --> 01:44.729
you kind of have some explaining to do

01:44.813 --> 01:48.108
for a lot of different choices you've made
and things that you've done

01:48.191 --> 01:52.195
and The Bachelor and all of that,
and I feel like it would be…

01:53.905 --> 01:56.491
I feel like it'd be good
for you to sit down with someone

01:56.574 --> 01:58.118
and have a tell-all interview

01:58.201 --> 02:02.372
and explain where you're coming from
and what you've been dealing with.

02:02.455 --> 02:04.874
Was it helpful for you?
'Cause you did yours on ESPN.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.127
Then you sat down with a journalist,
I'm assuming, right?

02:07.210 --> 02:08.628
Yeah, but it was written.

02:08.711 --> 02:12.549
I mean, for me, I had come out
to my family and a few close friends.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.802
Around that same time,
I was talking to a reporter from ESPN.

02:15.885 --> 02:17.387
So she had written this article.

02:17.470 --> 02:22.058
But until that article came out,
I wasn't actually out to the world.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.519
But I wanted that to be
the way people found out

02:24.602 --> 02:29.065
because I wanted people to hear my story
the way that I wanted it to be

02:29.149 --> 02:30.984
versus hearing it through the grapevine.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.821
So I think it's important
for Colton to come out in a public way.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.115
He's lived this lie for so long

02:37.198 --> 02:40.368
and been on The Bachelorette
and been the Bachelor.

02:40.451 --> 02:43.580
He owes it to a lot of people
to explain himself

02:43.663 --> 02:47.000
and give the world
an opportunity to really meet him.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.170
I don't think
I'd have done anything differently.

02:50.253 --> 02:55.175
I think that the one thing
that pretty much anyone that has come out

02:55.258 --> 02:58.928
and… and is now living out and proud
would probably tell you is, like,

02:59.012 --> 03:01.472
"I wish I did it sooner.
Why did I wait so long?"

03:01.556 --> 03:03.433
'Cause it sucks being in the closet.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.893
I feel like for you right now,

03:04.976 --> 03:06.978
you've told the people
closest in your life,

03:07.061 --> 03:09.147
like, such a good support system,

03:09.230 --> 03:11.774
and it's all there,
and everyone's been supportive.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.444
Yeah.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.779
I think it'll be a huge weight
off your shoulders,

03:16.863 --> 03:21.159
and you won't have to live in hiding
or in fear or in anxiety.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.686
-What's up?
-Hey.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.688
-How are you?
-Good.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.773
I brought Zuka.

03:53.066 --> 03:56.402
I tried to get my windshield fixed,
and I have to remove my light bar.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.112
-Okay.
-Do your thing.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.280
That's why I came here.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.117
-Ready?
-Yeah.

04:03.618 --> 04:05.370
-Okay, off.
-Sweet.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.748
And just give it here.
We'll set it in here.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.752
My dad has been processing this
for a few weeks now,

04:12.835 --> 04:15.380
internally and privately,

04:15.463 --> 04:17.840
but I definitely feel like,
since I've come out,

04:17.924 --> 04:19.884
nothing's changed between my dad and I.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.637
If anything, I feel like it's improved,
it's gotten better.

04:23.805 --> 04:27.058
The only thing
that has me a little nervous now is, um,

04:27.141 --> 04:28.559
I mean, with people knowing,

04:28.643 --> 04:31.104
it's not gonna be very long
until everybody knows.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.274
I feel like between you and Mom

04:34.357 --> 04:37.610
and the family here
and then everybody in Illinois…

04:38.778 --> 04:41.572
That was my biggest question mark
in all of this,

04:41.656 --> 04:43.366
is before the public finds out,

04:43.449 --> 04:45.618
I wanted to make sure
you guys are all good

04:45.702 --> 04:48.955
and, like, nothing was weird
in the family or in my friendships.

04:49.038 --> 04:52.041
And I feel like I have that now,
I have that support, and…

04:53.543 --> 04:56.170
I just want to, like,
be able to live my life,

04:56.254 --> 05:00.466
so I do want the freedom
that… being out publicly will give me.

05:02.427 --> 05:06.472
So have you thought about, maybe,
going out and talking publicly about it?

05:06.556 --> 05:09.434
It needs to be a conversation.
It can't just be me…

05:09.517 --> 05:11.477
-Making a statement.
-…making a statement,

05:11.561 --> 05:14.897
saying, "Let me tell you
what I've been through for 20 plus years."

05:14.981 --> 05:19.152
You get to pick the right person or have
the right person that understands you,

05:19.235 --> 05:22.655
understands where you're at,
and wants to have the conversation.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.158
A lot more people
than just Cassie

05:25.241 --> 05:28.411
are going to find out
that I'm gay from this interview.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.164
It's the girls from my season,

05:31.247 --> 05:32.915
my football teammates,

05:32.999 --> 05:35.209
my old church, my old priest,

05:35.877 --> 05:36.919
my old teachers.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.214
There are so many people I can't talk to
that are going to find out,

05:40.298 --> 05:43.634
and I don't know how they're gonna react.
I don't know if it's gonna be good,

05:43.718 --> 05:46.679
I don't know if it's gonna be bad,
I don't know if they're gonna support me,

05:46.763 --> 05:49.349
but it's important
for them to see me in this light,

05:49.432 --> 05:51.351
and for them to see the real me.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.020
Only negative about doing
a sit-down interview

05:54.103 --> 05:57.607
is, like, I can't control the questions.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.860
But I… I just want to be truthful,
and I want to be honest an--

06:00.943 --> 06:04.030
If you're being truthful and honest,
why does it matter what the questions are?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.824
-Mmm, I know.
-Know what I mean?

06:06.908 --> 06:07.742
Yeah.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.161
Who would you think, in your ideal mind…

06:10.244 --> 06:12.288
Do you have a top three people or…

06:12.372 --> 06:14.665
Well, you've known Ellen for a long time.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.086
-Yeah.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.213
I don't know
if that's the right choice now.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.550
Um, what about Robin Roberts?

06:24.634 --> 06:28.054
I mean, and you've been on her show
a couple times and talked to her.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.306
-Yeah.
-She has the athletic part.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.682
She has the background,

06:31.766 --> 06:33.142
and instead of a talk show,

06:33.226 --> 06:35.144
it's a little bit more of a true

06:36.229 --> 06:37.939
interview conversation.

06:38.022 --> 06:41.401
I think it could be presented as that,
but it should be done right.

06:41.484 --> 06:42.485
Mm-hmm.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.322
Talk to some people, see who the best…

06:46.406 --> 06:49.033
Maybe somebody we're not even
thinking about that'd be a good choice.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.619
Wherever I do it at,
I would like you to be there.

06:51.702 --> 06:55.289
-I'll be there for whatever you need.
-Do you just want to tweet it out for me?

06:55.373 --> 06:56.416
You want me to do that?

06:56.499 --> 06:58.835
-And my ten followers, let them know.
-Yeah.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.129
Just tweet it, and just say,
"By the way, my son's gay."

07:01.712 --> 07:02.630
Okay.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.108
-Hello!
-Hey, what's up?

07:22.942 --> 07:24.694
Ah, just running some errands.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.531
I have that big interview
that I'm sort of nervous about.

07:28.614 --> 07:34.245
I feel good that I sort of have, like,
the family and my close friends on board,

07:34.328 --> 07:37.874
and Dad's coming to New York
with me for the interview, so…

07:38.374 --> 07:40.751
-Absolutely.
-Makes me feel a little bit better.

07:40.835 --> 07:44.046
-Don't be nervous.
-I'm nervous. You know I naturally am.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.798
-You're gonna rock it.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.633
-Yeah.
-Put your confidence on.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.219
Are you still good
to watch Zuka for me?

07:50.720 --> 07:53.806
-Of course I am. I miss my granddaughter.
-Cool.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.350
Anyway, wish me luck. I love you.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.769
-Appreciate it.
-Love you more. Later!

07:58.853 --> 08:00.855
-All right, have a good day. Bye.
-Okay, bye.

08:08.738 --> 08:12.783
I'm glad Colton asked me to come
spend time with him and be here for him.

08:12.867 --> 08:17.872
You know, this has been a… a long,
lonely journey for him.

08:17.955 --> 08:22.168
I think there's a lot of questions
he needs to be prepared to answer.

08:22.251 --> 08:25.004
And how the public reacts
is how the public reacts.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.256
Whatever happens, I want him happy.

08:40.686 --> 08:41.771
I like New York.

08:41.854 --> 08:43.231
Just to think, two years ago,

08:43.314 --> 08:47.068
I was here to watch the ball drop
as… the Bachelor.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.945
-Yeah, was that two years ago?
-Yeah.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.489
So I got people coming
to the room at30 tomorrow.

08:51.572 --> 08:52.782
Your interview's at00?

08:52.865 --> 08:54.617
-My interview's at00.
-Okay.

08:55.743 --> 08:58.871
Have you prepped at all
for what you're going to talk about

08:58.955 --> 09:01.874
or what you're going to hear,
or is it just wide open to her?

09:01.958 --> 09:05.670
Man, I think… I mean,
I have an idea of what she's going to ask,

09:06.170 --> 09:08.297
but I truly don't know, so…

09:08.381 --> 09:12.218
I mean, you're fully expecting her to ask
some pretty tough questions, right?

09:13.302 --> 09:15.555
-Like, to get into it a little bit?

09:15.638 --> 09:17.807
Why did some of the things
that happened happen?

09:17.890 --> 09:20.560
And what were you thinking?
What was your thought process?

09:20.643 --> 09:22.812
And why couldn't you say something sooner?

09:23.479 --> 09:24.480
I'd ask it.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.901
I'd be asking all that stuff.
I'm curious. I got questions I wanna know.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.862
The reason I'm doing this
is because I want to stop lying.

09:31.946 --> 09:35.074
I want to stop hiding things,
and now I just wanna tell the truth and…

09:36.951 --> 09:38.452
I'm gonna tell the truth.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.830
I think there's a real fear for me

09:40.913 --> 09:43.791
that people are… going to say

09:43.874 --> 09:46.961
that I'm coming out
to try to save my image,

09:47.044 --> 09:52.550
and that I'm coming out
to bury the drama that I had with Cassie.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.552
That's the furthest thing from the truth.

09:54.635 --> 09:58.598
If anything, the reason I'm coming out
is because I'm ashamed

09:58.681 --> 10:02.393
and I'm sort of mortified of what got me
to this position in the first place.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.812
I knew I couldn't hide it anymore

10:04.895 --> 10:08.482
because I didn't want to affect
or harm anybody else in my life.

10:10.735 --> 10:14.113
What, we'll eat a little something,
go up and sit and talk a bit, hang out,

10:14.196 --> 10:15.740
and that's it for the night?

10:15.823 --> 10:17.325
Then get ready to go in the morning?

10:17.408 --> 10:18.451
-Yep.
-Okay.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.537
So another car got in here. There we go.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.955
-Perfect.
-Cool.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.665
We are here.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.128
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.589
Sweet.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.091
All right.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.679
Colt, food's here.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.600
-Oh, sweet. Already?
-Hey.

10:43.684 --> 10:44.644
Sweet.

10:45.853 --> 10:48.230
Sorry, I was thinking
while I was in the shower.

10:50.274 --> 10:54.153
Even though my dad and I haven't discussed
a whole ton after I've come out,

10:54.236 --> 10:57.406
we're forced to have
sort of uncomfortable conversations.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.117
And I think there's some beauty in that.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.036
And knowing…

11:03.454 --> 11:08.501
how open and vulnerable and honest
I want to be in this interview,

11:09.251 --> 11:11.754
I have to have a conversation with my dad

11:12.588 --> 11:14.840
that is open and honest too.

11:14.924 --> 11:17.176
What do you think?
You thought about it a little.

11:17.259 --> 11:21.639
If there's something that could be asked
that you don't want to answer, what is it?

11:23.099 --> 11:24.225
A simple one for me

11:24.308 --> 11:27.937
when I think about it more is,
why the hell were you the Bachelor?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.271
You knew you were gay,

11:30.356 --> 11:32.316
yet you decided to do that show?

11:33.067 --> 11:34.527
You went off the rails.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.448
Cassie filed a restraining order
against you,

11:40.032 --> 11:42.952
said you tracked her,
said you stalked her.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.204
If it was over,

11:46.706 --> 11:47.707
and you're gay,

11:48.708 --> 11:50.626
why go to those extremes?

11:53.295 --> 11:55.339
I knew that if I let her go,

11:56.173 --> 11:57.633
I would have to deal with me,

11:57.717 --> 12:00.261
and I didn't want to,
and I wasn't ready for it.

12:00.344 --> 12:03.472
Had Cassie said yes to marrying you,
would you be married right now?

12:04.265 --> 12:05.182
Yeah.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.183
Really?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.018
And living, what, miserably?

12:08.853 --> 12:11.439
'Cause you didn't talk to me
about this for so long.

12:11.939 --> 12:15.025
At first I got upset we couldn't talk,
'cause we talk about everything.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.819
Then I thought to myself,

12:16.902 --> 12:19.113
"What did I do as your dad
that made it seem

12:19.196 --> 12:21.031
you couldn't talk to me about this?"

12:23.117 --> 12:24.535
You're someone who

12:25.202 --> 12:27.621
hasn't always understood
the mental health aspect

12:28.456 --> 12:30.541
from my side of things,

12:31.792 --> 12:34.754
and at times has been frustrated
that I was even vocal about that.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.298
I told you, I've… I always… I grew up,

12:38.466 --> 12:40.176
and I always thought to myself that…

12:42.219 --> 12:44.513
a man doesn't need a therapist,
he sucks it up.

12:44.597 --> 12:48.142
You deal with your shit, face it, move on,
and you come out the other end.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.686
And I tried until I couldn't.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.356
No, I understand now,
but it confused me earlier,

12:54.440 --> 12:55.608
as we went through it.

12:57.735 --> 12:59.153
And I'm sorry for that.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.408
And I just don't want to see you
put so much out there again

13:04.492 --> 13:06.452
that, mentally, it starts to hurt.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.222
-What's up? How are you?
-Hi.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.640
-Good. How are you?
-Good.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.308
Got avocado all over me. Watch out.

13:29.391 --> 13:30.643
This is my dad.

13:30.726 --> 13:31.894
-Hey.
-Hi.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.730
-Gus. Nice to meet you.
-Gus, nice to meet you. Scott.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.149
-I brought you guys coffee.
-Oh. Awesome.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.193
How you feeling?

13:39.276 --> 13:42.863
-Good, excited, nervous, scared, happy.
-It's a big day.

13:42.947 --> 13:43.864
Yeah.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.407
All of the above.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.659
He was good last night.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.453
-Seems a little nervous today.
-Yeah. Yeah.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.413
It's gonna be
a huge weight off your shoulders

13:51.497 --> 13:53.833
when you just get to know
that it's out there.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.709
-I know.
-When the interview's done,

13:55.793 --> 13:58.504
it's done with you,
it's out of your hands, so…

13:58.587 --> 13:59.421
Yeah.

14:00.005 --> 14:03.300
I'm kinda curious what you think.
What's the worst-case scenario?

14:03.384 --> 14:05.761
What do you think
some of the backlash might be?

14:05.845 --> 14:10.182
That it feels like a grasp at fame
or, like, trying to get attention,

14:10.266 --> 14:14.436
and, like, using this as splashy tabloids,

14:14.520 --> 14:17.273
especially 'cause
he's obviously done so much stuff

14:17.356 --> 14:20.442
that encompasses a lot of publicity,
like The Bachelor and stuff.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.486
Whether or not Colton wants it,

14:22.570 --> 14:25.573
there's immediately
going to be expectation on him.

14:26.574 --> 14:30.327
And given his platform, his profile,
and the way that all of this is happening,

14:30.411 --> 14:32.997
I… I think it's better for him to be

14:33.080 --> 14:36.083
prepared and educated,
at least a little bit,

14:36.166 --> 14:38.836
and have sort of
an understanding of all the things

14:38.919 --> 14:42.882
that have happened for him
to be able to come out publicly.

14:42.965 --> 14:46.218
'Cause 50 years ago,
it wouldn't even have been an option.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.053
20 years ago,
it wouldn't have been an option

14:48.137 --> 14:51.640
for someone who played in the NFL
to come out and expect to receive support.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.560
So it's still a pretty new thing
that this is even, like,

14:55.185 --> 14:56.854
a… a path that he can go down.

14:57.438 --> 15:01.233
Colton is just coming out
and doesn't have all the answers,

15:01.317 --> 15:03.277
but there's sort of an expectation

15:03.360 --> 15:07.114
for him to better understand the community
that he's now become a part of.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.118
I think that there's
certainly a little bit of grace.

15:11.201 --> 15:14.747
I've only been out for six years,
and I'm still figuring out my shit.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.415
At the end of the day, it's a process,

15:16.498 --> 15:18.334
and it's not something
that happens overnight.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.586
I worry a little bit about that,

15:20.669 --> 15:23.380
the expectation of the platform
and what he has,

15:23.464 --> 15:26.800
but it is something I worry about there
'cause that happens in any…

15:27.927 --> 15:30.387
platform, if you will,
any movement, anything,

15:30.471 --> 15:31.889
regardless of what it is.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.475
-Yeah, you're not gonna please everybody.
-Right.

15:35.601 --> 15:39.355
I feel like you can stop trying right now
'cause it's never gonna happen.

15:39.438 --> 15:42.316
It's like, you do you,
but at the same time,

15:42.399 --> 15:45.736
you also don't want to offend anybody
if you can help it,

15:45.819 --> 15:48.948
and you don't want to put your foot
in your mouth, if you can help it.

15:49.031 --> 15:52.785
So I think that's what I'm trying to do.
I'm just trying to help make it as…

15:53.410 --> 15:55.454
least bumpy of a road as possible.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.539
I'm still learning a lot.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.874
A long ways to go.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.919
I'm hopeful that I'm going to progress,

16:02.586 --> 16:06.632
and I'm going to be more comfortable
in who I am because of today.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.637
-Shoot. You gonna grab that?
-Yeah.

16:13.722 --> 16:15.724
-Hi. How are you?
-What's up?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.726
Good. Come on in.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.604
I think we'll do…
Is it hair and makeup right here?

16:20.688 --> 16:23.148
-The lighting's great, so this is perfect.
-Sweet.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.442
Colton, what are you having them do?

16:25.943 --> 16:31.448
I'm just having them touch up these nails
'cause they're a little crazy right now.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.660
I work with my hands,
and my nails look better than yours.

16:34.743 --> 16:36.078
-I know.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.246
They look great.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.580
Are you hitting on my dad?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.666
-Just a clipper. That's all you need.
-No.

16:40.749 --> 16:44.086
Chill. This is what makes me nervous
about you two being in the same room.

16:44.169 --> 16:46.880
I'm a little shocked
you were so nervous to come out to him.

16:46.964 --> 16:49.341
He wears a choker necklace. He's an ally.

16:51.885 --> 16:53.554
You know what his favorite drink is?

16:53.637 --> 16:54.680
Vodka soda.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.223
-It's gay water.
-Yeah. Is it?

16:56.306 --> 16:57.766
-Yeah.
-There we go.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.112
Good luck.

17:16.994 --> 17:17.995
Getting more nervous?

17:18.078 --> 17:19.038
A little bit.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.623
This is a… This is a lot.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.758
-Is this it?
-This is it.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.288
All right, thank you.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.462
I thought it went good, so…

18:08.545 --> 18:11.173
Yeah, I'm very happy
that I did it with her.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.216
Yeah.

18:12.299 --> 18:16.178
The moment I sat down and she was like,
"This is just a conversation,"

18:16.261 --> 18:19.139
-I was like, "Thank God."
-Yeah. No, I know. I agree.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.224
This is Mom.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.475
-Hi, Mama.
-What's up?

18:21.558 --> 18:23.185
It went really good.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.063
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.315
I feel this huge sense of relief for you.

18:28.398 --> 18:31.360
Yeah, it's like a weight
off of all of our backs.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.321
Everything flowed
and you didn't feel stressed?

18:34.404 --> 18:37.574
-Just no anxiety or anything?
-No. No, they let Dad sit there.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.244
You're on speaker, by the way.
He's right here, so…

18:40.327 --> 18:44.039
It was a very sincere, very genuine,
very good conversation between them.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.958
It was really, really good.

18:46.041 --> 18:47.709
Oh man, I'm really proud.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.461
Colton, I'm so proud of you.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.588
-Thanks, Mama.
-I'm so proud.

18:52.172 --> 18:56.093
You guys are the reason
why I was able to do it, so thank you.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.137
-Aw.
-Yeah.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.722
So he's taking me to my first gay bar.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.433
-Seriously.

19:03.517 --> 19:07.563
Just FYI, Colton,
your dad's been a gay magnet all his life.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.772
-Really?

19:08.856 --> 19:12.067
Great. I'm sure he's gonna be
magnetizing some people today.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.111
God's sake…

19:14.194 --> 19:16.029
I'll keep you posted, give you updates,

19:16.113 --> 19:18.198
and I'll let you know
if I set Dad up with anybody.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.992
-Oh yeah--
-I'm kidding.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.118
I think…

19:21.201 --> 19:23.287
-I love you, Mama. Bye.
-Love you. Bye-bye.

19:23.787 --> 19:25.831
She's funny.

19:25.914 --> 19:28.333
-Where are we headed to?
-Stonewall.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.262
A vodka soda. Vodka soda.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.097
Hi.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.099
-How was it?
-Ah, it was good.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.602
-Yeah? Oh my God, you're so smiley.
-Really good.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.936
Good to see you.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.480
-Here. Try that.
-Thanks. I'm buying a hat.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.817
-Are you? Love it. Oh.
-Okay.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.739
Oh. That's right. Okay, excuse me, guys.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.449
-It went good.
-Yeah? Tell me.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.701
-Did you get emotional?
-Yeah.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.579
He was emotional from the beginning,
a little, and the nerves.

20:05.662 --> 20:08.290
His nerves really started showing,
which made me emotional.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.708
-Nerve-racking--
-Yeah, for sure.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.252
I never thought those words
would come out of my mouth.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.879
-I never envisioned--
-Did you cry?

20:13.962 --> 20:16.089
-A little bit.
-I thought I saw him do it a bit.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.132
Colton…

20:17.216 --> 20:19.301
The interview doesn't air until tomorrow,

20:19.384 --> 20:23.847
but there is a sense of relief for me
that I'm finally living my truth.

20:23.931 --> 20:27.768
I'm finally living my purpose
and being honest to myself,

20:27.851 --> 20:30.187
and I don't know
how people are going to react.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.606
But now going through this,

20:32.689 --> 20:35.567
I see the value
of having this transparency

20:35.651 --> 20:38.737
and really being honest with everybody.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.491
And I hope that I can do that
from here on out.

20:43.492 --> 20:46.328
You could tell she came
from a place of understanding--

20:46.411 --> 20:48.538
She's been through a similar experience.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.957
So she understood why.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.124
Where, to me,

20:52.167 --> 20:53.001
I still don't.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.586
I mean, I'm working on it.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.089
You're here in a gay bar,
the gay bar.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.174
But I thought it went really well.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.052
-I'm happy. Can't wait to see it.
-Very proud.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.596
This is actually
the owner of The Stonewall Inn.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.514
Really?

21:05.597 --> 21:07.933
So how long
have you owned this place, then?

21:08.016 --> 21:10.352
-Since 2006.
-Okay.

21:10.435 --> 21:11.937
Following the interview,

21:12.020 --> 21:14.564
Gus thought
it was a good idea to celebrate

21:14.648 --> 21:17.317
by going to the historic Stonewall Inn,

21:17.401 --> 21:21.613
and to celebrate what the people
before me in my community did

21:21.697 --> 21:25.117
and how hard they fought
to have the simple rights that I have,

21:25.200 --> 21:28.996
allowing me to even be in a position
to go on Good Morning America

21:29.079 --> 21:30.455
to say, "Hey, I'm gay."

21:31.164 --> 21:33.917
So now it's very exciting
for y'all. I'm excited for you.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.712
-Thank you.
-I think it's very, very important.

21:36.795 --> 21:38.505
It's important that the youth,

21:39.548 --> 21:41.550
the gay youth, knows their history.

21:41.633 --> 21:42.467
Yeah.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.345
They have to know
what happened here in this bar.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.764
-It's not that long ago.
-It's not that long ago.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.558
This is 1969.

21:49.641 --> 21:55.397
Back then, it was illegal to be gay.
It was illegal to say who you loved.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.442
And what would happen was,

21:58.525 --> 22:00.694
this is where lesbians come,

22:00.777 --> 22:03.405
transgender, gay men.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.741
This is everyone's place.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.869
And cops would come here
and raid the place.

22:08.952 --> 22:11.997
So, June 28th, 1969,

22:12.080 --> 22:15.500
when the cops came in that night,
they fought back for the first time.

22:16.084 --> 22:18.670
It was Black trans women
and drag queens

22:18.754 --> 22:21.923
that were on the front line
throwing bricks and fighting police

22:22.007 --> 22:24.509
and fighting for their lives
and their rights.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.721
People heard something was going on
at Stonewall, so they came out.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.932
And before you knew it,
they were all protesting outside.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.061
And the cops barricaded themselves
inside the club here.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.355
And it went on for three days.

22:36.855 --> 22:40.484
So those people in 1969
fought back for your right

22:40.567 --> 22:43.653
to come out and tell your dad
in front of the media and everything.

22:43.737 --> 22:44.571
Yeah.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.573
And it's important
everyone knows that.

22:46.656 --> 22:49.743
So it's easier now,
but the trans community's not fully there.

22:49.826 --> 22:52.079
Trans women of color
are still getting killed.

22:52.162 --> 22:57.250
Like, we literally just got protections
in the workplace for… for gay people.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.002
-Oh yeah.
-Like, right now.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.170
It's so crazy.

23:00.253 --> 23:03.215
So up until basically now,
you could be fired for being gay.

23:03.298 --> 23:05.008
Twenty-eight states, a year ago.

23:05.092 --> 23:07.427
Twenty-eight states,
and it was completely fine.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.971
That was a valid reason to be fired.
It's insane.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.891
All just for loving someone.

23:12.974 --> 23:16.269
What's important is
the youth has to know this,

23:16.353 --> 23:17.979
they have to know their history.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.858
If they don't know their history,
they could lose their future.

23:21.942 --> 23:26.446
Yeah, and… and you're great
to go out and speak out on it, you know?

23:26.530 --> 23:29.616
And you have that platform
that a lot of people don't.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.412
So I hope you use it
to the community's advantage.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.497
You never know who you're going to touch

23:35.580 --> 23:38.625
by saying something
that hit you when you were younger.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.629
And that's the whole point
of me being here, even today, is like…

23:43.380 --> 23:45.465
-I just want to do my homework now.
-Yeah.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.342
I ran from my life for a long time,

23:47.426 --> 23:49.428
-and I just…
-You're nervous.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.222
My life gets to start tomorrow
after the interview, so…

23:53.223 --> 23:54.474
Congratulations.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.226
There it goes.

23:57.644 --> 23:58.728
Look where we are.

24:00.021 --> 24:00.981
What is this?

24:01.064 --> 24:01.982
Gay Street?

24:03.859 --> 24:06.027
I wanna take a photo with you
to post tomorrow.

24:06.111 --> 24:07.404
Here, you wanna do it?

24:07.487 --> 24:10.073
-Maybe get lower so the sign's in it.
-Which side?

24:10.157 --> 24:10.991
You have a side.

24:11.074 --> 24:13.827
I don't, but I'm gonna put you
in the street 'cause you're taller.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.621
There we go. Got a few.

24:16.705 --> 24:18.290
-Cute.

24:18.373 --> 24:19.833
It's all done tomorrow.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.419
Like a kid on Christmas Eve now,
just waiting.

24:22.502 --> 24:23.336
Yeah.

24:24.212 --> 24:27.340
-No more hiding.
-Yeah. I can't stop smiling.

24:27.841 --> 24:30.135
I know there's gonna be people
who are gonna have opinions--

24:30.218 --> 24:31.386
Don't even bring them up.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.014
-That does not even matter.
-That world's not even here.

24:34.639 --> 24:37.309
There's a couple moments
I could look back in my life and say,

24:37.392 --> 24:39.019
"Wow, that changed my life."

24:39.102 --> 24:43.732
The support from my parents,
my family, my friends is pretty special.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.652
Now this interview
is going to be one of those moments.

24:47.736 --> 24:52.324
It's nice to know
that I can sort of just be out in open,

24:52.407 --> 24:55.452
which I never thought
was gonna be possible.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.996
I'm excited
to wake up early to see it.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.664
-To watch this? Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:59.748 --> 25:02.626
I think I'll probably have a drink
really early in the morning.

25:03.126 --> 25:06.922
-Some mimosa orange juices?
-Maybe two or three.

25:20.644 --> 25:21.770
Hi.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.438
Matchy-matchy again. Look at that.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.564
Did I miss it?

25:24.648 --> 25:25.815
No, not yet.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.403
-How you doing, man?
-Hey, morning.

25:30.487 --> 25:31.738
Morning.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.865
-How you feeling?
-Good.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.619
Excited, just a little nervous, but…

25:38.161 --> 25:40.330
Have you read anything?
They sort of teased it.

25:40.413 --> 25:41.373
Yeah, they teased it.

25:41.456 --> 25:44.709
I mean, everyone's speculating,
and everyone's saying

25:45.544 --> 25:47.003
whatever they wanna say, but…

25:47.087 --> 25:47.963
Yeah.

25:48.046 --> 25:51.466
…if those same people watch the interview,
they might feel different.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.469
-Have you talked to Cassie?
-No.

25:56.513 --> 25:59.349
-So she's going to find out right now?
-Yeah.

26:00.725 --> 26:02.769
I wish things didn't end how they did

26:02.852 --> 26:05.605
so I could have at least given her
a heads up and been--

26:05.689 --> 26:09.401
Actually conversate about it.
You know what I mean?

26:09.484 --> 26:12.487
I would imagine that
you're going to hear from Cassie today.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.864
-I don't think so.
-You really don't?

26:14.948 --> 26:15.782
No.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.161
Whew! I'm nervous.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.914
-Now I'm getting nervous.

26:23.623 --> 26:28.378
Obviously, like, this year's been a lot
for a lot of people, and…

26:30.964 --> 26:34.801
it's probably made a lot of people
look at themselves in the mirror

26:34.884 --> 26:37.512
and figure out who they are,
what they've been running from

26:37.596 --> 26:40.223
or what they've been
putting off in their lives.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.891
And for me, um,

26:42.392 --> 26:46.146
I've ran from myself for a long time,
and I've hated myself for a long time,

26:47.147 --> 26:48.565
and I'm gay.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.400
-And…
-You're gay!

26:50.483 --> 26:52.736
I came to terms with that
earlier this year,

26:52.819 --> 26:54.321
and I've been processing it.

26:55.572 --> 26:58.283
And the only reason
I'm sitting down with you today

26:58.366 --> 27:01.161
is because I have the love and support
of my friends and family.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.626
Oh, buddy…

27:07.709 --> 27:09.502
Whew.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.088
-You okay?
-Yeah.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.049
I'm happy. I'm good.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.178
We ripped the Band-Aid off.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.430
I remember that feeling so vividly.

27:20.513 --> 27:23.683
-Yeah.
-Like, those exact same happy tears.

27:24.267 --> 27:26.144
Yeah.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.314
What are you thinking?

27:29.397 --> 27:32.609
I'm excited that I, like,
I don't have to have a secret anymore.

27:32.692 --> 27:34.819
I can't thank you both enough…

27:34.903 --> 27:37.864
-…for being there for me.

27:37.947 --> 27:39.658
Is it going crazy right now?

27:39.741 --> 27:41.242
-Is it just continually…
-Yeah.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.828
Oh my God, put that on silent.
It's about to go wild.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.373
-Let's get something to eat.
-Get something to eat?

27:46.456 --> 27:47.415
Put that away.

27:48.708 --> 27:49.876
We gonna eat here or…

27:49.959 --> 27:52.545
Leave your phone down
and be present here for a while.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.841
Andy Cohen goes,
"You are free now, Colton."

27:56.925 --> 27:58.259
"A toaster is on its way."

27:58.343 --> 27:59.594
What's "a toaster" mean?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.054
Like a cheers?

28:01.137 --> 28:02.097
I would assume so,

28:02.180 --> 28:05.350
but it would be very funny
if Andy Cohen sent you a toaster.

28:05.433 --> 28:07.811
-A toaster for toast.

28:08.395 --> 28:09.396
Here's one,

28:09.479 --> 28:13.483
and it says,
"The final rose goes to… the gays."

28:13.566 --> 28:15.318
-Andy Cohen.

28:16.569 --> 28:19.572
I just had the first girl
from my season tweet about it.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.282
-Who?
-Onyeka.

28:21.366 --> 28:22.701
-Really? Good.
-Yeah.

28:23.284 --> 28:25.537
"Happy for you, Colton,
for speaking your truth."

28:25.620 --> 28:26.830
"We support you. Heart."

28:26.913 --> 28:28.039
That was nice.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.083
"Happy for Colton."

28:30.166 --> 28:33.044
"If you're gay, be gay!
I've been gay forever and I love it!"

28:33.128 --> 28:35.880
Nicole… "I'm so proud of you, Colton!"

28:35.964 --> 28:40.552
Loni Love… "All the best to you Colton.
Life gets better standing in your truth!"

28:41.428 --> 28:42.303
That's for sure.

28:42.804 --> 28:45.557
-That's all on Instagram or GMA's thing?
-That's on Twitter.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.350
-I pivoted to Twitter.
-You're on Twitter?

28:47.434 --> 28:50.812
I'm scared to keep scrolling,
but it's actually been pretty good.

28:51.938 --> 28:54.274
"Happy for him
that he can now live his truth."

28:54.357 --> 28:57.402
"I still don't like
how he treated his past relationships,

28:57.485 --> 29:00.447
but now, maybe,
we will see a new, better Colton."

29:01.030 --> 29:01.990
Um…

29:02.073 --> 29:04.033
You will for sure see a new better Colton,

29:04.117 --> 29:06.995
and I don't like how
I treated my past relationships either.

29:15.462 --> 29:16.921
You're trending on Twitter.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.215
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

29:19.966 --> 29:23.261
I know you're gonna read it
'cause it's impossible not to,

29:23.344 --> 29:25.513
but I would try not to.

29:27.932 --> 29:31.144
"Hang on. Isn't Colton Underwood the guy
who harassed and stalked his girlfriend

29:31.227 --> 29:32.771
and put a tracking device on her car?"

29:32.854 --> 29:36.524
"Why does he get an exclusive interview
on Good Morning America?"

29:38.902 --> 29:41.488
"You're not gay. You're trying to get
a new, better identity

29:41.571 --> 29:43.698
with the public
from what you did to Cassie."

29:43.782 --> 29:47.160
"Satan is definitely in your ear.
I'm praying for your mental health."

29:47.660 --> 29:49.621
All of the responses that I saw were like,

29:49.704 --> 29:51.790
"He's still a stalker and an abuser."

29:51.873 --> 29:54.083
And, "Why give this man a platform?"

29:54.667 --> 29:57.253
Try to stay off the Twitter
and don't look at that part.
