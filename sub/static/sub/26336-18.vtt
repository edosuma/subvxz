01:31.671 --> 01:35.573
Look... for the record,
all right?

01:36.642 --> 01:38.509
To be clear,

01:38.578 --> 01:40.144
I do this for you,

01:40.213 --> 01:42.024
we're even, we're square, right?
There's no-no favor

01:42.048 --> 01:43.681
hanging over my head anymore?

01:43.750 --> 01:45.590
Are you referring to the liver
that I gave you,

01:45.651 --> 01:46.884
the-the gift of life?

01:46.953 --> 01:48.319
Is that the...?
That's the one.

01:48.388 --> 01:49.687
Yeah, okay, we're even,

01:49.756 --> 01:50.988
'cause this
is life or death.

01:51.057 --> 01:52.523
All right. All right. Good.

01:52.592 --> 01:55.326
Hey, bud. Thank you.

01:55.395 --> 01:57.862
I just got to make sure
you're okay with this.

01:57.930 --> 02:00.075
I mean, you've been getting a
lot of mileage out of this one.

02:00.099 --> 02:02.311
You sure you want to retire it
on something small like this?

02:02.335 --> 02:04.568
Yeah, yeah.
You-you don't, you don't know

02:04.637 --> 02:06.404
what we're walking into,
you haven't met her.

02:06.472 --> 02:08.639
You'll-you'll understand
when you, when you do, okay?

02:08.708 --> 02:19.150
Danny, I've done a lot of
protection details in my life.

02:19.218 --> 02:21.619
I got to say this is
genuinely fascinating.

02:21.687 --> 02:23.487
I've seen you in a lot
of tough situations

02:23.556 --> 02:25.055
over the years, right?
Yeah.

02:25.124 --> 02:26.812
Life on the line type stuff,
back to the wall.

02:26.836 --> 02:28.493
Mm-hmm.

02:28.494 --> 02:30.672
Look at you, you're all tense
and edgy over an old lady?

02:30.696 --> 02:32.997
Well, that-that should tell
you something, shouldn't it?

02:36.269 --> 02:39.370
All right. I mean,
all I'm saying

02:39.439 --> 02:41.539
is that it doesn't
make sense to me, all right?

02:41.607 --> 02:43.085
And she's not even
your mother-in-law anymore

02:43.109 --> 02:44.353
and look how dramatic
you're being.

02:44.377 --> 02:45.843
Okay, I'm not being
dramatic, okay?

02:45.912 --> 02:47.144
You don't know her, I do.

02:47.213 --> 02:48.323
She, uh, she's a certain way;

02:48.347 --> 02:49.914
she tortured me my
entire marriage.

02:49.982 --> 02:51.882
Okay? Just, what are you
gonna do? Just tell me.

02:51.951 --> 02:54.185
I'm gonna stand there
and look handsome

02:54.253 --> 02:55.731
and not say anything ever.
That's right.

02:55.755 --> 02:57.988
That's right-- she's-she's,
she's very snobby,

02:58.057 --> 03:00.357
she does not, uh, have
a good sense of humor.

03:00.426 --> 03:02.760
You will offend her if you are
yourself, so don't do that.

03:02.829 --> 03:04.328
Okay?

03:04.397 --> 03:05.796
Whatever you want.
I'm just saying,

03:05.865 --> 03:08.065
I'm sure she's not as bad
as you're making out.

03:08.134 --> 03:09.967
Okay.

03:14.207 --> 03:15.873
Oh, thank God you're here.

03:15.942 --> 03:18.209
Something terrible
has happened.

03:18.277 --> 03:19.810
one die?

03:19.879 --> 03:21.312
The airline has lost my luggage.

03:21.380 --> 03:24.315
Oh.
Oh. Hello.

03:24.383 --> 03:25.816
Who's this?

03:25.885 --> 03:27.296
- Um... Yeah.
- Come on in, come on in.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.586
Stop dragging
your feet, Daniel.

03:28.654 --> 03:31.055
I'm walking as
fast as I can.

03:32.325 --> 03:33.706
<i>Victim's name is Brad Chen.</i>

03:33.707 --> 03:34.939
24 years old.

03:35.008 --> 03:36.708
C.O.D. was...

03:36.777 --> 03:39.511
Well, he was hit
by a semitruck head-on

03:39.579 --> 03:40.739
traveling at 70 miles per hour.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.615
Oh, yeah, that'll do it.

03:42.616 --> 03:44.193
You'll excuse me if I
don't lift the sheet

03:44.217 --> 03:46.451
to take a look at this one?
- Of course.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.297
This happened on the H-1 highway
late last night,

03:48.321 --> 03:49.254
and according to witnesses,

03:49.322 --> 03:51.089
Mr. Chen walked
into oncoming traffic

03:51.158 --> 03:54.359
shirtless and screaming
at passing motorists.

03:54.428 --> 03:56.528
Really? Well,
it seems to me

03:56.596 --> 03:58.763
that Mr. Chen's sudden desire

03:58.832 --> 04:00.665
to stop a speeding truck

04:00.734 --> 04:02.901
with his face was perhaps
chemically induced.

04:02.969 --> 04:05.036
Oh, he was definitely
on drugs, all right.

04:05.105 --> 04:07.138
Just not the kind
you might expect.

04:07.207 --> 04:10.041
Tox screen indicates
a cocktail of HGH

04:10.110 --> 04:12.043
and testosterone,
as well as a huge dose

04:12.112 --> 04:13.511
of pyrovalerone.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.280
Okay, I've heard
of the first two,

04:15.348 --> 04:17.482
but what's Pyro... Pyro...

04:17.551 --> 04:19.884
Valerone. It's a central
nervous system stimulant.

04:19.952 --> 04:21.219
Athletes use it

04:21.288 --> 04:23.154
to increase stamina
and to shed weight.

04:23.223 --> 04:24.389
But the thing is,

04:24.458 --> 04:27.692
this drug is almost chemically
identical to bath salts.

04:27.761 --> 04:31.429
It causes delirium,
agitation, paranoia.

04:31.498 --> 04:33.498
Users often feel invincible,

04:33.567 --> 04:35.667
which can lead
to self-injurious behavior.

04:35.736 --> 04:37.535
Okay, so the guy
took a bad cocktail

04:37.604 --> 04:39.816
of drugs and convinced himself
he was the Incredible Hulk.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.339
What do you guys
call that again?

04:41.408 --> 04:42.785
What is it, "death
by misadventure"?

04:42.809 --> 04:44.609
Yes, but this isn't
a case of that.

04:44.678 --> 04:46.778
I had the lab run
a tissue sample,

04:46.847 --> 04:48.580
and analysis confirmed
that our Vic

04:48.648 --> 04:50.515
was definitely
a regular steroid user,

04:50.584 --> 04:52.317
but there was no sign

04:52.385 --> 04:53.945
that he'd ever used
pyrovalerone before.

04:53.987 --> 04:55.987
And for good reason--
nothing good

04:56.056 --> 04:57.789
can come out of
combining these drugs.

04:57.858 --> 05:00.759
A high dose like this,
and pyrovalerone is extremely lethal.

05:00.827 --> 05:02.894
So you're saying the
presence of this drug

05:02.963 --> 05:04.829
all but guaranteed his death?

05:04.898 --> 05:07.432
I'm saying that if Brad Chen
hadn't been killed by the truck,

05:07.501 --> 05:09.181
he would have died
within a matter of hours

05:09.236 --> 05:10.802
from massive cardiac arrest.

05:10.871 --> 05:12.203
Well, then that leads me

05:12.272 --> 05:14.773
to conclude there's only one
of two things possible here.

05:14.841 --> 05:17.075
Either Chen goofed up
his regular injection

05:17.144 --> 05:19.104
by topping it off
with the drug that killed him...

05:19.146 --> 05:22.013
Or someone wanted him dead and
then messed with his steroids

05:22.082 --> 05:23.459
to make it happen, in
which case, this wouldn't

05:23.483 --> 05:25.817
be an accident.
- That's right. It'd be murder.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.645
This is all my fault.

05:38.714 --> 05:42.149
This is what I get
for flying commercial.

05:42.217 --> 05:45.218
And of course, also...

05:45.254 --> 05:48.255
for compromising my standards

05:48.290 --> 05:50.357
for the sake
of my cheapskate publisher.

05:50.425 --> 05:51.625
Here.

05:51.693 --> 05:53.627
Do sit down.

05:56.131 --> 06:00.467
And now my beautiful
Louis Vuitton vintage luggage

06:00.536 --> 06:02.002
is God knows where.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.638
I mean, how difficult
can it be

06:04.706 --> 06:07.274
to get seven suitcases
on a plane?

06:07.342 --> 06:10.110
Seven suitcase? How long,
uh, how long you staying for?

06:10.179 --> 06:12.045
Two days.
Ah.

06:12.114 --> 06:13.180
So you packed light.

06:14.616 --> 06:17.184
Sorry. That's a terrible joke.
This is horrible,

06:17.252 --> 06:18.785
what's happened,
but we're gonna get

06:18.854 --> 06:20.319
to the bottom of it;
we'll figure it out.

06:20.343 --> 06:21.455
You know, I don't think

06:21.456 --> 06:24.024
that you really
understand the enormity

06:24.092 --> 06:25.092
of this crisis, Daniel.

06:25.127 --> 06:26.626
Oh, no, I-I do.

06:26.695 --> 06:29.362
But please, explain to me
the enormity of the crisis.

06:29.431 --> 06:31.398
Isn't it obvious?

06:31.466 --> 06:32.766
I have absolutely
nothing to wear

06:32.835 --> 06:35.135
for my book signing.
You look fantastic!

06:35.204 --> 06:37.018
You should wear what
you're wearing right now.

06:37.042 --> 06:37.738
Don't be ridiculous.

06:37.739 --> 06:42.475
I can't possibly wear this
travel-stained, creased outfit.

06:42.544 --> 06:46.313
My fans expect me to look
glamorous all the time.

06:46.381 --> 06:49.249
I guess I'll just have
to pray to the gods of fashion that

06:49.318 --> 06:53.653
I can find something suitable
in this godforsaken place.

06:56.925 --> 06:58.625
You don't say much, do you?

07:00.696 --> 07:02.395
How long have you known him?

07:06.034 --> 07:08.602
Daniel's my partner.
We work together.

07:08.670 --> 07:10.437
My name's Steven.

07:10.505 --> 07:12.906
And for the record, it's very
nice to meet you, Mrs. Savage.

07:12.975 --> 07:16.109
Oh, please,
call me Mandy... Steve.

07:16.178 --> 07:19.446
And I'm very happy that
we're gonna be working together.

07:19.514 --> 07:21.715
I hope that Daniel
filled you in on the problem.

07:21.783 --> 07:24.751
My usual security
officer, Gavin,

07:24.820 --> 07:26.720
well, his visa ran out,

07:26.788 --> 07:28.555
so he's trapped in the U.K.

07:28.624 --> 07:30.624
Aha. Well,

07:30.692 --> 07:32.192
we will endeavor to fill

07:32.261 --> 07:33.660
Gavin's shoes

07:33.729 --> 07:36.763
and make sure your stay here
is both pleasant and safe.

07:36.832 --> 07:39.633
Well... you certainly
look the part.

07:40.702 --> 07:44.271
But are you capable?

07:44.339 --> 07:46.907
I can handle myself.

07:46.975 --> 07:49.542
I'll bet you can.

07:49.611 --> 07:51.177
Uh, he's a...

07:51.246 --> 07:53.046
ex-Navy SEAL.
- Mm-hmm.

07:53.115 --> 07:55.159
He's the head of Five-O, so
he could definitely handle

07:55.183 --> 07:57.250
a couple of crazy
fans, no problem.

07:57.319 --> 07:58.985
Well, how divine.

07:59.054 --> 08:02.555
A Navy SEAL--
that is so exciting.

08:02.624 --> 08:04.658
Well, I think we'd
better stop chitchatting,

08:04.726 --> 08:07.394
otherwise I'm never
gonna get anything to wear.

08:07.462 --> 08:10.297
Uh, would you mind
calling the limo?

08:10.365 --> 08:11.298
The lim--
Uh, we got,

08:11.366 --> 08:13.600
uh, I got my car downstairs.

08:13.669 --> 08:14.669
Oh. What is it?

08:14.736 --> 08:15.869
It's a Camaro.

08:15.938 --> 08:17.137
A Camaro?

08:17.205 --> 08:18.371
I don't think so.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.073
I'll just go freshen up.

08:20.142 --> 08:21.241
Ciao.

08:24.846 --> 08:25.946
So...

08:26.014 --> 08:27.881
what do you think?

08:27.950 --> 08:29.382
Expensive.

08:29.451 --> 08:30.728
Not about the champagne.
Oh, she's great.

08:30.752 --> 08:31.752
I love her.
See?

08:31.820 --> 08:32.860
- I love her.
- Yeah, well,

08:32.921 --> 08:33.921
she served you champagne.

08:33.956 --> 08:35.133
She didn't give me
any champagne.

08:35.157 --> 08:36.990
She also never told me
to call her Mandy--

08:37.058 --> 08:38.258
I've known her
20 years.

08:38.327 --> 08:40.465
- Right? - Yeah.
- You hear the thing about the car?

08:40.466 --> 08:42.195
What do you think
about that? Not nice.

08:42.264 --> 08:43.897
Not a nice
thing to say.

08:43.966 --> 08:45.799
I think she knows
what she wants, and I think

08:45.867 --> 08:47.100
you need to relax.

08:47.169 --> 08:48.646
That's all. Just take it,
take it down a notch.

08:48.670 --> 08:49.670
Okay?

08:51.873 --> 08:53.106
Ready to go, boys?

08:53.175 --> 08:54.741
Yep.

08:55.944 --> 08:57.844
Do you mind?
Do I mind?

08:57.913 --> 08:59.813
Of course I don't mind.
Oh. Thank you.

08:59.881 --> 09:02.382
Uh... <i>andiamo.</i>

09:02.451 --> 09:04.084
<i>Andiamo.</i> Oh,
you speak Italian.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.652
You're quite
the charmer.

09:05.721 --> 09:06.987
Kiss-ass.

09:10.625 --> 09:12.425
From the age of four,

09:12.494 --> 09:15.628
I couldn't get that mitt
out of his hand.

09:15.697 --> 09:19.199
Well, obviously, you had
yourself one talented boy.

09:20.869 --> 09:23.870
Scouts started coming to his games
when he was in junior high.

09:23.939 --> 09:26.006
All of them said Brad
had the potential

09:26.074 --> 09:27.974
to be one of those
five-tool players.

09:29.077 --> 09:31.478
He got a full ride
at Vanderbilt,

09:31.546 --> 09:33.146
won a national
championship there...

09:33.215 --> 09:34.848
and then worked his way up

09:34.916 --> 09:37.484
to Triple-A ball in Texas.
Coaches were saying it was

09:37.552 --> 09:40.220
just a matter of time before
he got called up to the majors.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.322
So how'd he end up
back in Hawaii?

09:43.625 --> 09:46.826
About a year ago,
he tore his rotator cuff.

09:46.895 --> 09:49.029
Had the surgery,
did all the right things,

09:49.097 --> 09:52.899
and... eventually got back
to about 90% of what he was.

09:53.578 --> 09:55.745
Mm, that ten percent.

09:55.813 --> 09:57.780
Yeah. Yeah,
that makes all the difference

09:57.849 --> 10:00.216
when you're talking about
having a career in the pros.

10:00.284 --> 10:02.518
Kid was tough, though.

10:02.587 --> 10:04.553
Never gave up.
That's why he moved back.

10:04.622 --> 10:06.555
To rehab and get healthy.

10:06.624 --> 10:08.658
He knew the odds
were against him,

10:08.726 --> 10:10.826
but that wasn't gonna
stop him from trying.

10:12.330 --> 10:15.264
Mr. Chen, were you aware that
your son was doing steroids?

10:17.068 --> 10:18.434
No.

10:18.503 --> 10:21.404
But baseball was
everything to Brad,

10:21.472 --> 10:23.806
and he was desperate
to get that back.

10:23.875 --> 10:26.575
The injection he took

10:26.644 --> 10:28.678
last night contained
a lethal dose of the drug

10:28.746 --> 10:30.980
pyrovalerone,

10:31.049 --> 10:33.716
and it's highly unlikely
that that was an accident.

10:33.785 --> 10:36.719
I don't understand.
What are you saying?

10:36.788 --> 10:38.098
We're treating
this incident

10:38.122 --> 10:38.691
like a homicide.

10:38.692 --> 10:40.842
Do you know
of anyone

10:40.843 --> 10:42.287
who might've wanted
to target your son?

10:42.311 --> 10:43.543
Target him?

10:43.612 --> 10:44.085
Yeah.

10:44.109 --> 10:45.813
No, of course not.
He was a good kid.

10:45.814 --> 10:47.058
Well, in that case,
whoever supplied Brad

10:47.082 --> 10:49.649
with those steroids
is our lead suspect,

10:49.718 --> 10:52.552
which is why it's very important
that we track them down.

10:52.621 --> 10:54.855
I'm sorry, but I have no idea

10:54.923 --> 10:56.656
where Brad would've
gotten steroids from.

10:56.725 --> 10:59.593
It doesn't
make sense.

10:59.661 --> 11:01.762
Why would someone
want to hurt my boy?

11:01.830 --> 11:05.799
Well, Mr. Chen, that's what
we're gonna try to find out.

11:17.513 --> 11:18.779
Okay, here we go.

11:18.847 --> 11:22.149
I got, uh, empty vials.

11:22.217 --> 11:24.251
They have letters on them.
I'm guessing for

11:24.319 --> 11:27.487
the day of the week
that he took the dose.

11:27.556 --> 11:30.791
Yep, got one here, too.

11:30.859 --> 11:33.293
This one says Wednesday, which
would make that his last dose.

11:33.362 --> 11:35.695
All right, let's bag it
and take it back to the lab.

11:35.764 --> 11:38.209
Our killer's DNA or fingerprints
could be on one of these vials.

11:38.233 --> 11:40.567
Wouldn't that be oh-so-helpful?

11:40.636 --> 11:42.936
Which probably means
it's not gonna happen.

11:43.005 --> 11:44.071
Ever the optimist.

11:49.611 --> 11:51.545
Yo, check this out.

11:53.916 --> 11:55.782
Bags of blood?

11:55.851 --> 11:57.784
Not typically what people
put in their fridge.

11:57.853 --> 11:59.686
No.

12:06.061 --> 12:07.828
You know, I thought
"shop till you drop"

12:07.896 --> 12:09.629
was just an expression.
I may actually

12:09.698 --> 12:11.565
collapse under the weight
of these bags.

12:11.633 --> 12:13.633
Yeah, you guys got
a lot in common, you know.

12:13.702 --> 12:15.102
She's got no impulse control
either.

12:15.170 --> 12:16.970
And also, did you notice
that she didn't take

12:17.039 --> 12:19.239
any of my advice, but you,
it's like you were, like,

12:19.308 --> 12:20.828
uh, a fashion guru or something.
-Yeah.

12:20.876 --> 12:22.287
- Let me tell you something, buddy.
- What?

12:22.311 --> 12:24.978
I'm four glasses
of champagne in today,

12:25.047 --> 12:27.447
I am going with the flow
and enjoying the ride.

12:27.516 --> 12:29.382
I suggest you do
the same thing.

12:34.756 --> 12:36.990
Small token to say thank you
for all your help.

12:37.059 --> 12:37.991
What?

12:38.060 --> 12:40.193
I realize, of course,

12:40.262 --> 12:42.992
that Daniel had to come because
of the family obligations

12:42.993 --> 12:44.592
and that,
but you came here

12:44.661 --> 12:46.161
of your own volition,

12:46.229 --> 12:49.164
and for that, I thank you.
- Cuff links, wow.

12:49.232 --> 12:50.965
This...

12:51.034 --> 12:52.278
I mean that-that--
you-you really,

12:52.302 --> 12:53.501
you didn't have to do this.

12:53.570 --> 12:54.936
No, it's nothing really.

12:55.005 --> 12:56.905
Nothing? That's what I got.

12:56.973 --> 12:59.274
Did you say something,
Daniel?

12:59.342 --> 13:01.209
No, I didn't.

13:04.247 --> 13:07.015
Amanda... Mandy,
tell me something.

13:07.084 --> 13:09.884
Where do you get these ideas
for all these books you write?

13:09.953 --> 13:11.886
Oh, well,

13:11.955 --> 13:14.089
they just come to me,

13:14.157 --> 13:15.423
Steven. Yeah.
Huh.

13:15.492 --> 13:17.625
In fact, I've just had
this wonderful idea

13:17.694 --> 13:19.627
for a new romance.

13:19.696 --> 13:21.296
It's a brilliant story

13:21.364 --> 13:23.565
about a handsome
police detective

13:23.633 --> 13:27.035
who risks everything
for the love of an older woman.

13:27.104 --> 13:28.770
Oh.

13:28.839 --> 13:30.705
Not that old, actually.

13:32.509 --> 13:34.442
I would, uh, I would read that.

13:34.511 --> 13:36.377
Yeah, except he
can't actually read

13:36.446 --> 13:38.446
unless it's a cereal box
or something like that.

13:38.515 --> 13:40.115
You know, my favorite

13:40.183 --> 13:41.716
sex scene was in a limousine.

13:41.785 --> 13:43.785
Well, not a limousine
like this.

13:43.854 --> 13:46.625
I mean, this reminds me
of my daughter's wedding day.

13:46.626 --> 13:47.322
Oh, yeah?

13:47.346 --> 13:50.203
I had such high hopes
for Rachel.

13:50.627 --> 13:53.628
She dated
some wonderful men.

13:53.697 --> 13:55.330
She even dated a minor member

13:55.398 --> 13:57.298
of the royal family.
- Is that right?

13:57.367 --> 13:59.167
Yeah.

13:59.236 --> 14:02.337
Well, I had a vision
of arriving at her wedding

14:02.405 --> 14:05.173
to a marvelous English cathedral

14:05.242 --> 14:07.308
in a horse-drawn carriage.

14:07.377 --> 14:08.643
Instead, I found myself

14:08.712 --> 14:10.345
in a place called "Hackensack,"

14:10.413 --> 14:11.946
driving in
a white limousine

14:12.015 --> 14:14.649
with a fish tank in it.

14:14.718 --> 14:16.451
My dad paid extra
for the fish tank.

14:16.486 --> 14:17.986
Really classed it up,
you know?

14:18.054 --> 14:20.088
Really nice.
Uh-huh.

14:20.157 --> 14:22.957
Well, Daniel, you and I have
different ideas

14:23.026 --> 14:25.560
of what constitutes class.

14:28.431 --> 14:30.031
<i>So lab results</i>

14:30.100 --> 14:32.801
are back, and as we expected,
the blood in the mini fridge

14:32.869 --> 14:33.968
was drawn from our Vic.

14:34.037 --> 14:35.517
Makes sense.
The guy was doping.

14:35.572 --> 14:37.138
Drawing and reinjecting
his own plasma

14:37.207 --> 14:38.873
to increase stamina
and endurance.

14:38.942 --> 14:40.842
Yeah, that would be
the natural assumption.

14:40.911 --> 14:43.444
However, Noelani found
no evidence of increased

14:43.513 --> 14:45.346
blood oxygenation
during autopsy.

14:45.415 --> 14:47.549
Well, why is this guy
storing his own blood?

14:47.617 --> 14:49.217
Could be a member
of a vampire community.

14:49.252 --> 14:50.752
Yeah, that was a good one.

14:52.455 --> 14:53.833
Oh, you're not joking.
He's not joking.

14:53.857 --> 14:54.789
It's a real thing.

14:54.858 --> 14:56.491
I mean,
they're not actual vampires.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.792
Just like-minded individuals

14:57.861 --> 14:58.793
who embrace a lifestyle

14:58.862 --> 14:59.994
and drink blood on occasion.

15:00.063 --> 15:01.162
Yeah.

15:01.231 --> 15:03.331
What do you say
we table the vampire theory

15:03.400 --> 15:04.966
for now, Jerry?
- Copy that.

15:05.035 --> 15:07.368
Do we have anything else?

15:07.437 --> 15:09.037
Lab results on the vials.

15:09.105 --> 15:11.573
The discarded silver-topped ones
were a mix

15:11.641 --> 15:13.041
of steroids and testosterone,

15:13.109 --> 15:16.511
and the recently used
gold-topped one tested positive

15:16.580 --> 15:18.880
- for pyrovalerone.
- Okay, so what do we think?

15:18.949 --> 15:20.882
Someone switched out
one of the vials,

15:20.951 --> 15:22.483
and our Vic just didn't notice?

15:22.552 --> 15:24.730
That sounds good, except for
there's another possibility.

15:24.754 --> 15:26.554
Maybe this gold top vial
is one of many

15:26.623 --> 15:28.089
that are circulating
at the moment.

15:28.158 --> 15:29.502
Which means
there could be a whole batch

15:29.526 --> 15:30.725
of bad product out there.

15:30.794 --> 15:32.371
Well, if that's the case,
we could be looking

15:32.395 --> 15:33.528
at a lot more body drops.

15:33.597 --> 15:35.141
And this could escalate
into a full-blown

15:35.165 --> 15:36.598
public health crisis.

15:36.666 --> 15:39.100
Well, whatever the case
may be, one thing is clear.

15:39.169 --> 15:40.769
We're on a clock, people.
We need to find

15:40.837 --> 15:42.757
the source of these drugs
before more people die.

15:45.191 --> 15:47.273
Ladies and gentleman,
it's my pleasure

15:47.274 --> 15:48.773
to introduce our honored guest.

15:49.580 --> 15:52.180
You know her as the acclaimed
author of such bestsellers

15:52.181 --> 15:53.648
as <i>Five Nights in Cairo,</i>

15:53.716 --> 15:56.450
<i>Castle of Secrets</i>
and <i>Mallory's Lament.</i>

15:56.519 --> 15:58.185
Her latest novel,
<i>The Queen's Chamber,</i>

15:58.254 --> 16:00.588
is available through
Mystique Publishing.

16:00.657 --> 16:02.089
- Ah!
- Please

16:02.158 --> 16:06.027
give a warm welcome
to Amanda Savage!

16:06.095 --> 16:07.928
Hello.

16:09.999 --> 16:12.500
Keep these mouth-breathers
away from me,

16:12.568 --> 16:14.302
and don't let them paw me.

16:14.370 --> 16:15.703
I hate to be touched.

16:15.772 --> 16:17.204
Anything else?

16:17.273 --> 16:21.108
Yes. When I say the code word,
get me out of here.

16:21.210 --> 16:23.210
What's the
code word?

16:23.246 --> 16:24.745
"Get me out of here."

16:24.814 --> 16:26.380
Got it.

16:26.449 --> 16:27.581
Thank you for coming.

16:27.650 --> 16:28.949
You look wonderful.

16:29.018 --> 16:30.785
- We love you, Amanda!
- Thank you.

16:30.853 --> 16:32.687
You rang?

16:32.755 --> 16:35.189
Indeed I did. Adam?

16:35.258 --> 16:38.225
So I did some digging
into Brad Chen.

16:38.294 --> 16:42.163
As you'd expect for an athlete
who was rehabbing from injury,

16:42.231 --> 16:43.898
guy was a total
gym rat.

16:43.966 --> 16:45.900
Those are the logs
from a local gym

16:45.968 --> 16:47.468
called "Island
Club and Spa."

16:47.537 --> 16:49.503
Okay. Well,
it looks like he spent

16:49.572 --> 16:50.838
every waking hour here.

16:50.907 --> 16:53.140
Makes sense. These places
are swimming in steroids.

16:53.209 --> 16:55.142
Plus, tons of people
looking for shortcuts

16:55.211 --> 16:57.289
to get some gains, and dealers
who see a captive market.

16:57.313 --> 16:58.546
Right, so this is likely

16:58.614 --> 16:59.980
where Brad
got his supply.

17:00.049 --> 17:01.549
I'm impressed.

17:01.617 --> 17:03.050
Thing is,

17:03.119 --> 17:05.419
if we're gonna catch the guy
who sold to him,

17:05.488 --> 17:06.854
we can't exactly go in there

17:06.923 --> 17:08.422
flashing our badges.

17:08.491 --> 17:09.623
Hmm.

17:11.493 --> 17:13.694
Okay. Yeah, I know
what this look means.

17:13.762 --> 17:15.162
Do you know
what it means?

17:15.231 --> 17:16.430
Mm-hmm.

- Hey, thanks for that tip.

17:58.141 --> 18:00.408
Matt. Matt Zenner.
Matt Zenner.

18:00.476 --> 18:02.243
Hey, dude, I'm gonna
definitely hit you up

18:02.311 --> 18:03.655
about that personal
training, all right?

18:03.679 --> 18:04.890
Only if you want
to get swole, dude.

18:04.914 --> 18:06.914
Yes, sir.
Yeah.

18:06.983 --> 18:08.416
<i>Hey, attention, everyone.</i>

18:08.484 --> 18:11.986
I want to introduce our latest
addition to the ICS family.

18:12.054 --> 18:13.454
This is Ashleigh.

18:13.523 --> 18:14.822
She'll be teaching

18:14.891 --> 18:16.991
step aerobics and yoga.

18:17.059 --> 18:19.593
Mm-hmm.
But today, she's just observing

18:19.662 --> 18:20.761
and learning the ropes.

18:20.830 --> 18:21.929
So make her feel at home.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.600
Thank you so much.

18:26.669 --> 18:28.602
Hi.
I'm Ashleigh.

18:28.671 --> 18:30.638
Hi. Millie.
Nice to meet you. So,

18:30.706 --> 18:32.506
is this, like, a
chill place to work?

18:32.575 --> 18:34.608
'Cause, um, you know,
the last gym I was at--

18:34.677 --> 18:36.021
it was swimming with
these muscle heads.

18:36.045 --> 18:37.978
You know the type. Like,
they get all juiced up

18:38.047 --> 18:39.580
on steroids,
and then they...

18:39.649 --> 18:42.082
they get agro with
the female staff.

18:42.151 --> 18:44.351
Yeah, I hate to break it
to you, but there's a lot

18:44.420 --> 18:46.020
of that here, too.
- Really?

18:46.088 --> 18:47.354
<i>All right, my man,</i>

18:47.423 --> 18:49.190
thank you.
Okay.

18:50.526 --> 18:52.426
I'm pretty sure that
guy thinks I'm gay.

18:52.495 --> 18:55.663
Weird. You're just
a normal heterosexual dude

18:55.731 --> 18:57.209
chatting up every muscly guy
in this gym.

18:57.233 --> 18:59.166
What would make anyone
think that?

18:59.235 --> 19:01.435
Anyway, did you find anything?

19:01.504 --> 19:02.915
Well, I've been laying
it on pretty thick that,

19:02.939 --> 19:04.383
you know, I'm in the
market for some juice,

19:04.407 --> 19:05.806
but everyone here
is pretty cagey

19:05.875 --> 19:07.441
about where they
get their product.

19:07.510 --> 19:09.043
Meanwhile, I've done, like,

19:09.111 --> 19:11.979
17 sets of bench press,
80-something dead lifts,

19:12.048 --> 19:13.380
ran ten miles on
the treadmill.

19:13.449 --> 19:15.950
I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

19:16.018 --> 19:17.551
Okay, well, I got a tip for you.
Okay.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.385
So, my new bestie,
Millie the dance instructor?

19:19.409 --> 19:19.821
Mm-hmm.

19:19.822 --> 19:21.155
She says that that guy,

19:21.224 --> 19:22.957
Derek-- he's, like,

19:23.025 --> 19:23.958
really deep in
the roids scene.

19:24.026 --> 19:26.827
He seems pretty intense.
Yeah.

19:26.896 --> 19:29.530
And he's single, too, from what
I hear, so get in there, cowboy.

19:29.599 --> 19:30.798
Go get him.

19:32.602 --> 19:33.868
That's impressive, man.

19:33.936 --> 19:35.970
Yeah, thanks.

19:36.038 --> 19:37.171
Hold on a second.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.639
I got to 'gram this.

19:38.708 --> 19:40.641
"Just another day
in the lab.

19:40.710 --> 19:42.676
"#Gymtime,

19:42.745 --> 19:44.645
"#Gains,

19:44.714 --> 19:47.515
#BeYourBest."

19:47.583 --> 19:49.183
Dude,

19:49.252 --> 19:51.585
your biceps, man--
they're jacked.

19:51.654 --> 19:53.153
Got any tips?

19:53.222 --> 19:55.789
Most people, when they think
arms, they think biceps.

19:55.858 --> 19:57.191
Tri is the bigger muscle.

19:57.260 --> 19:58.993
You got to do your dips,

19:59.061 --> 20:01.328
skull crushers,
close-grip push-ups.

20:01.397 --> 20:03.664
Oh, yeah, man. Yeah,
yeah, I-I hear you, man.

20:03.733 --> 20:05.833
You know, sometimes
I'm just a little bit

20:05.902 --> 20:07.301
impatient, you know?

20:07.370 --> 20:08.969
Want to see
them gains.

20:09.038 --> 20:10.571
I feel you.

20:10.640 --> 20:14.441
So, uh, you know anyone
who could hook me up?

20:14.510 --> 20:15.843
You know what I mean?

20:17.346 --> 20:18.879
Meet me out back.

20:18.948 --> 20:19.880
Five minutes.

20:19.949 --> 20:20.949
All right.

20:21.017 --> 20:22.983
Ashleigh.
Yeah?

20:23.052 --> 20:24.184
I need a favor.

20:24.253 --> 20:25.519
Um, okay. What?

20:25.588 --> 20:26.598
My kid's school just called.

20:26.622 --> 20:27.766
He puked all over
the lunch room,

20:27.790 --> 20:28.790
and I gotta pick him up.

20:28.858 --> 20:31.058
Can you cover my class?

20:31.127 --> 20:35.496
Um, okay. Yeah, what--
what-what class is it?

20:39.302 --> 20:42.770
Hi. Okay, hello.
Thanks for coming.

20:42.838 --> 20:46.774
Welcome to Booty Boost 101.

You all right?

21:28.784 --> 21:31.485
Hear that stuff
about the wedding?

21:31.554 --> 21:33.988
Yeah, it was a little harsh.
Little bit.

21:34.056 --> 21:35.189
But that's the difference

21:35.257 --> 21:37.658
between, uh, English
and American. You know, they...

21:37.727 --> 21:40.527
Look, first of all,
they're notoriously stuck-up.

21:40.596 --> 21:42.396
And second of all,
their humor, it's...

21:42.465 --> 21:44.164
I mean, it's a little cutting,
you know?

21:44.233 --> 21:46.000
I-I don't...
I don't think it is, uh...

21:46.068 --> 21:48.369
has anything to do
with cultural differences.

21:48.437 --> 21:49.837
I think she just
doesn't like me.

21:49.905 --> 21:51.372
You know, never has.
I know.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.374
Uh, you know, when I, uh...

21:53.442 --> 21:56.377
when I was gonna propose
to Rachel,

21:56.445 --> 21:59.580
I thought it'd be a nice thing
to ask her for her blessing

21:59.649 --> 22:00.759
'cause her father
had passed away.

22:00.783 --> 22:02.063
So I flew all the way
to England,

22:02.118 --> 22:03.462
which I could not afford
at the time,

22:03.486 --> 22:06.220
only for her to tell
me, "No. Beat it."

22:06.288 --> 22:08.022
She told you no?

22:08.090 --> 22:11.692
Yeah. Specifically, she said,
"Oh, uh, I'm gonna tell Rachel

22:11.761 --> 22:13.761
"the same thing I
always tell my agent.

22:13.829 --> 22:15.162
Uh, never take the first offer."

22:15.231 --> 22:16.563
That's what she said.

22:17.733 --> 22:19.667
I'm glad you think that's funny.
No, I'm sorry.

22:19.735 --> 22:21.301
It's not funny.
Please, go on.

22:21.370 --> 22:23.281
Uh, there's nothing to go on.
We obviously got married.

22:23.305 --> 22:24.883
Rachel told me to blow
it off, which I did,

22:24.907 --> 22:26.918
but then, you know, things
start to get a little rocky

22:26.942 --> 22:28.409
between Rachel and I.
Huh.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.544
You got somebody in her ear
telling, uh, you know,

22:30.613 --> 22:32.057
"You're not good enough.
You're not good enough."

22:32.081 --> 22:33.625
Then you start to think, "Not
good enough. Not good enough.

22:33.649 --> 22:34.993
"Things aren't working.
Not good enough.

22:35.017 --> 22:36.583
Not good enough."
You know what I mean?

22:36.652 --> 22:37.951
You know what that is, right?

22:38.020 --> 22:39.720
That right there,
that's self-pity talking.

22:39.789 --> 22:41.889
Okay? 'Cause let me
tell you right now,

22:41.957 --> 22:44.425
you, my friend,
you are more than adequate.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.193
Thank you. Thank you.
You're welcome.

22:55.304 --> 22:56.737
Yo, Derek.

22:56.806 --> 22:58.839
We cool?
Dude, you got some nerve

22:58.908 --> 23:00.040
coming into our gym,

23:00.109 --> 23:02.009
asking around for product
on your first day.

23:02.078 --> 23:03.944
That kind of move will
get people talking.

23:04.013 --> 23:06.513
And the last thing we
want is for you to ruin

23:06.582 --> 23:08.782
the sweet situation
we got going here.

23:08.851 --> 23:11.318
Okay, so you're worried
about the cops coming down here?

23:11.387 --> 23:12.953
Uh, yeah.

23:13.022 --> 23:15.856
All right. Well, am I gonna get
my product or what?

23:15.925 --> 23:17.752
Because I still need
to hit my quads today.

23:17.753 --> 23:19.827
Smart-ass.

23:19.895 --> 23:21.061
Yeah, I got your product.

23:21.130 --> 23:22.541
But how about we give
you a beatdown instead?

23:22.565 --> 23:23.497
Hmm?

23:23.566 --> 23:24.631
Kick his ass.

23:34.744 --> 23:36.176
You broke my nose, man.

23:36.245 --> 23:37.377
Oh, yeah, I broke your nose?

23:37.446 --> 23:38.946
Now you're under arrest.

23:39.014 --> 23:40.981
All right?

23:41.050 --> 23:42.050
Dude, you're a cop?

23:42.084 --> 23:44.451
Yeah, I'm a cop.
Now you're gonna tell me

23:44.520 --> 23:46.620
the name of the dealer
supplying this gym.

23:46.689 --> 23:49.323
All right? Move
before I break your teeth.

23:49.391 --> 23:52.526
<i>So, I've been reviewing CCTV</i>
<i>from the gym.</i>

23:52.595 --> 23:54.762
For liability reasons,
almost the whole club

23:54.830 --> 23:56.630
is covered with cameras,
which is good for us

23:56.699 --> 23:59.666
because a week ago,
our Vic, Brad Chen,

23:59.735 --> 24:02.069
was captured lurking around
the "employees only" area.

24:02.138 --> 24:03.871
Check this out.

24:03.939 --> 24:06.406
What is he doing?

24:06.475 --> 24:08.408
Where's he going?

24:08.477 --> 24:10.122
Into the men's locker room
or something? What is that?

24:10.146 --> 24:12.479
Yeah. No cameras in there,
of course, but check out

24:12.548 --> 24:15.115
the time code. He exits
less than three minutes later.

24:15.184 --> 24:17.751
Wearing the exact same clothes.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.853
Oaky, where's he going
in such a hurry?

24:19.922 --> 24:21.755
Well, I spoke
to the gym manager,

24:21.824 --> 24:23.690
and he did a quick check,

24:23.759 --> 24:25.670
and it seems one of their
master keys went missing.

24:25.694 --> 24:27.861
These keys can open
any locker in the place.

24:27.930 --> 24:29.040
However, none of the members

24:29.064 --> 24:30.898
reported anything stolen
around that date.

24:30.966 --> 24:33.400
I guess
not. The only thing

24:33.469 --> 24:35.781
that Chen would have been going
in that locker room to steal

24:35.805 --> 24:37.004
would be steroids.
Right.

24:37.072 --> 24:38.338
So, no one's gonna report that.

24:38.407 --> 24:41.975
Okay. So, Chen swipes
the master key

24:42.044 --> 24:43.510
and then goes into the locker

24:43.579 --> 24:45.145
of someone that he
knows has product.

24:45.214 --> 24:47.548
He's only got a short window.
Doesn't check the vials,

24:47.616 --> 24:49.383
ends up grabbing one
of the gold tops.

24:49.451 --> 24:51.919
You're saying he dosed himself
by accident?

24:51.987 --> 24:54.488
Which means that whoever
he stole the drugs from

24:54.557 --> 24:56.056
was either
the intended target...

24:56.125 --> 24:57.724
Or that was the person
who was peddling

24:57.793 --> 24:59.726
this new poisoned steroid.

24:59.795 --> 25:00.994
Just heard from Junior.

25:01.063 --> 25:03.008
According to one of
the regular buyers at the club,

25:03.032 --> 25:06.233
the steroids are all run through
a member named Moses Pacheo.

25:06.302 --> 25:07.901
Perfect. You got an address?

25:23.519 --> 25:25.452
The hell happened here?

25:25.521 --> 25:27.054
Neighbor called in a complaint.

25:27.122 --> 25:28.555
The homeowner, Moses Pacheo,

25:28.624 --> 25:30.057
was tearing his
own house apart.

25:30.125 --> 25:31.825
Wait, one man did all this?

25:31.894 --> 25:34.728
Mr. Pacheo was in an extremely
agitated state when we arrived.

25:38.434 --> 25:40.314
<i>We tried to subdue him,</i>
<i>but he resisted.</i>

25:49.411 --> 25:51.912
<i>I've never seen anything</i>
<i>like it. He put five</i>

25:51.981 --> 25:53.780
<i>of my officers down.</i>
Move! Move!

25:53.849 --> 25:55.582
That's it. Stop!

26:01.323 --> 26:02.386
Get down on the ground!

26:02.410 --> 26:03.825
<i>So I gave the order</i>
<i>to open fire,</i>

26:03.826 --> 26:06.193
<i>and he took three slugs</i>
<i>like it was nothing.</i>

26:06.262 --> 26:07.928
So, uh, what put him
under that sheet?

26:07.997 --> 26:09.162
His own heart, apparently.

26:09.231 --> 26:10.330
<i>All of a sudden,</i>

26:10.399 --> 26:11.732
<i>he collapsed and dropped dead</i>

26:11.800 --> 26:13.200
from a massive cardiac arrest.

26:13.269 --> 26:15.213
Well, sounds to me like he got
ahold of the same toxic batch

26:15.237 --> 26:17.371
of steroids that killed
Brad Chen, doesn't it?

26:17.439 --> 26:19.172
Yeah. And now that he's dead,

26:19.241 --> 26:22.175
we're no closer to finding out
who's behind all this.

27:28.697 --> 27:29.963
Well...

27:30.031 --> 27:33.600
found the inventory
for Pacheo's house of roids.

27:33.668 --> 27:35.401
And they all have silver tops.

27:35.470 --> 27:37.704
Ones I found in the bathroom
have gold tops.

27:37.773 --> 27:38.773
Okay, these are unopened.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.218
These must be the
ones he's selling.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.971
Maybe the ones with gold
tops are for personal use?

27:41.972 --> 27:44.477
Yeah. Also found a used vial
and syringe.

27:44.546 --> 27:46.279
Looks like he had just shot up.

27:46.348 --> 27:47.867
Oh, well, that explains
why he went berserk.

27:47.891 --> 27:48.516
Yeah.

27:48.517 --> 27:50.450
Got something
you guys should see.

27:54.022 --> 27:55.355
Wow.

27:55.423 --> 27:57.457
See, that's just nasty.

27:57.526 --> 27:59.626
I hope this guy didn't do
a lot of home cooking.

28:00.729 --> 28:03.163
Check it out.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.134
That appears to be the initials
of whomever this blood

28:08.203 --> 28:10.503
was drawn from
and the date that it was drawn.

28:10.572 --> 28:12.038
If it's other people's plasma,

28:12.107 --> 28:15.008
then that likely means
different blood types.

28:15.076 --> 28:17.644
So Pacheo couldn't have been
using this to dope himself.

28:17.712 --> 28:19.679
Then what was he using it for?

28:20.782 --> 28:22.148
<i>So, I heard back</i>

28:22.217 --> 28:23.497
from the lab.
That cache of drugs

28:23.552 --> 28:24.784
that Moses Pacheo was selling

28:24.853 --> 28:27.554
tested positive
for HGH and testosterone.

28:27.622 --> 28:30.657
However, his personal stash
was positive for pyrovalerone.

28:30.725 --> 28:32.125
That confirms it.

28:32.194 --> 28:33.693
Pacheo was
the intended target

28:33.762 --> 28:36.296
of those tainted steroids,
not Brad Chen.

28:36.364 --> 28:38.398
Oh, yeah. It's pretty obvious
Chen got dosed

28:38.466 --> 28:40.834
when he stole the vials
from Pacheo, not realizing

28:40.902 --> 28:42.802
that he had taken one
of the tainted gold tops.

28:42.871 --> 28:45.705
All right, let's talk about
Pacheo's personal blood bank.

28:45.774 --> 28:47.974
DNA shows it was drawn
from several male donors,

28:48.043 --> 28:49.609
all of whom
were steroid users.

28:49.678 --> 28:50.810
Hey, wait a minute. Okay.

28:50.879 --> 28:52.745
What does that say
right there? "M.Z."

28:52.814 --> 28:54.314
I talked to a guy
at the gym today.

28:54.382 --> 28:56.349
A juicer named Matt Zenner.

28:56.418 --> 28:58.218
You don't say.

28:59.287 --> 29:02.355
Okay, here's how it worked.

29:02.424 --> 29:04.490
Once a week, I'd draw
blood and trade it

29:04.559 --> 29:06.025
to Moses for steroids.

29:06.094 --> 29:07.460
It was a great deal.

29:07.529 --> 29:09.162
In fact, he even
kicked me some cash

29:09.231 --> 29:11.264
to bring other guys
in on the operation

29:11.333 --> 29:13.333
so long as they
matched the profile.

29:13.401 --> 29:15.702
What was the profile?
Healthy,

29:15.770 --> 29:17.904
fit guys between the
ages of 18 and 25.

29:17.973 --> 29:20.740
So, that's how
you came to know Brad Chen?

29:20.809 --> 29:23.710
Yeah. I brought him in on
the deal a few months ago.

29:23.778 --> 29:25.766
But just the other week,
Moses cut Brad out.

29:25.767 --> 29:26.450
Why?

29:26.474 --> 29:28.646
Moses told him his
blood was no good.

29:29.284 --> 29:31.451
Something about his
platelet count was off.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.186
In any case, he was out.

29:33.255 --> 29:35.188
Hang on.

29:35.257 --> 29:36.890
Maybe he's telling the truth.

29:36.958 --> 29:38.858
If he is, it would explain why

29:38.927 --> 29:41.194
Chen stole steroids
out of Pacheo's locker.

29:41.263 --> 29:43.096
Right. His supply got cut off,

29:43.164 --> 29:45.324
and suddenly there was no
way for him to get his stuff.

29:45.367 --> 29:47.300
It's not like he could
just stop his rehab.

29:47.369 --> 29:49.068
Hmm.

29:49.137 --> 29:51.471
Moses Pacheo.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.306
What'd he need
all that blood for?

29:53.375 --> 29:54.774
I don't know.

29:54.843 --> 29:57.443
He made it clear this was a
"no questions asked" situation.

29:57.512 --> 30:00.079
I wasn't about to jeopardize
a sweet deal like this

30:00.148 --> 30:02.081
by pushing him for answers.

30:06.354 --> 30:08.888
I'm done smiling for the month.

30:08.957 --> 30:11.391
Well, I don't know
about you two guys,

30:11.459 --> 30:14.260
but I'm absolutely famished.
Good.

30:14.329 --> 30:15.828
Uh, I went ahead
and made reservations

30:15.897 --> 30:17.797
at three of the nicest,

30:17.866 --> 30:19.219
most expensive restaurants
on the island.

30:19.220 --> 30:20.710
Uh, would you like
to hear your options?

30:20.734 --> 30:22.169
No.

30:22.170 --> 30:23.836
- No?
- Steven, darling.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.505
No?
This is your island.

30:25.573 --> 30:27.640
So tell me,

30:27.709 --> 30:29.142
where would you take a woman

30:29.210 --> 30:32.378
hungry to explore
the local flavors?

30:34.916 --> 30:36.749
I got just the place.

30:36.818 --> 30:39.218
Come on.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.237
Please make sure
that everything is fresh,

30:46.261 --> 30:47.760
because if she gets
food poisoning,

30:47.829 --> 30:49.762
uh, we'll all be killed.

30:49.831 --> 30:51.931
Hold up. Your ex-mother-in-law

30:52.000 --> 30:53.399
is Amanda Savage?

30:53.468 --> 30:55.068
Uh-huh.

30:55.136 --> 30:56.903
What? I read.

30:56.972 --> 30:58.905
Y-You read romance novels?

30:58.974 --> 31:00.239
Don't knock 'em.

31:00.308 --> 31:03.943
The Mallory
series... is dope.

31:04.012 --> 31:06.379
You know, I got to tell you
something, I've known a lot

31:06.448 --> 31:09.482
of people in my life.
And that man right there?

31:09.551 --> 31:11.351
He's the best of the best.

31:11.419 --> 31:12.885
Are you talking about

31:12.954 --> 31:15.455
the heavy fellow
in the T-shirt or Daniel?

31:15.523 --> 31:17.156
Mandy.

31:17.225 --> 31:18.925
Did he ask you to do PR for him?

31:18.994 --> 31:20.626
No, of course not.

31:20.695 --> 31:22.261
Oh, well,
let's stop talking about him.

31:22.330 --> 31:24.464
Tell me something
about yourself.

31:24.532 --> 31:26.010
You want to get you an autograph
or something like that?

31:26.034 --> 31:28.167
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:28.236 --> 31:29.535
- Thank you.
- Yeah, no doubt.

31:29.604 --> 31:30.770
Tell her hi.

31:30.839 --> 31:32.939
Yeah. I'll be sure to do that.

31:33.008 --> 31:34.440
Oh, hey.

31:34.509 --> 31:35.742
Here we go.

31:35.810 --> 31:37.677
Ah... ooh.
Lunch is served.

31:37.746 --> 31:40.480
Uh, the, uh, proprietor
would like a autograph.

31:40.548 --> 31:42.815
Oh, okay, I'll have Gavin
send him,

31:42.884 --> 31:44.417
um, a headshot from London.

31:44.486 --> 31:47.186
This looks delicious.

31:47.255 --> 31:49.493
Thank you, Steven,
this was an excellent choice.

31:49.517 --> 31:51.517
You're welcome.

31:51.926 --> 31:53.960
You know, if I,
if I were to pick this place,

31:54.029 --> 31:55.461
you would've told me
that it was,

31:55.530 --> 31:56.996
uh, no good, that it was cheap.

31:57.065 --> 31:58.531
Probably.

31:58.600 --> 31:59.999
What is your point?

32:00.068 --> 32:02.802
Uh, my-my point is that, um...

32:02.871 --> 32:04.804
is that I can't win with you.

32:04.873 --> 32:07.173
- You're being oversensitive, Daniel.
- Am I?

32:07.242 --> 32:08.474
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, well,

32:08.543 --> 32:10.476
then you're gonna think
this is very childish.

32:10.545 --> 32:12.612
You guys enjoy, all right?

32:12.680 --> 32:13.913
Oh.

32:17.218 --> 32:19.452
<i>So, I did</i>

32:19.521 --> 32:22.055
some digging into our dead
steroid dealer, Moses Pacheo,

32:22.123 --> 32:23.956
and I think I worked out
what's going on.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.392
Guy was a high school dropout.
Couldn't hold a steady job.

32:26.461 --> 32:29.228
Cut to eight months ago,
and his financials reveal

32:29.297 --> 32:30.941
that he's been making
thousands of dollars a month.

32:30.965 --> 32:35.134
My theory is that he's
been trading the plasma

32:35.203 --> 32:38.237
of healthy young men for
pharmaceutical-grade steroids

32:38.306 --> 32:39.439
and cash.

32:39.507 --> 32:40.907
Okay, putting aside

32:40.975 --> 32:44.310
why anyone would even want
human blood in the first place,

32:44.379 --> 32:45.778
we have any idea
who was supplying

32:45.847 --> 32:47.146
the steroids to Pacheo?

32:47.215 --> 32:48.655
I've been trying
to follow the money,

32:48.683 --> 32:51.350
but the cash received was run
through several shell corps.

32:51.419 --> 32:53.319
It's gonna take a while
to sort that out.

32:53.388 --> 32:54.854
Yo. We got something.

32:54.923 --> 32:56.122
Okay.

32:56.191 --> 32:59.058
Given that Pacheo
was regularly moving blood,

32:59.127 --> 33:01.360
we looked into the handful
of biomedical couriers

33:01.429 --> 33:03.062
on the island, and,

33:03.131 --> 33:04.664
what do you know,
we found one

33:04.732 --> 33:07.600
that made regular pickups
at Pacheo's house

33:07.669 --> 33:09.569
and then dropped
off at a clinic

33:09.637 --> 33:13.005
of a local doctor
named Niles Werner.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.740
Well done, young ones.
Saved Jerry

33:14.809 --> 33:16.442
a pile of work.

33:16.511 --> 33:18.911
Well, it turns out Werner was
a regular snake oil salesman.

33:18.980 --> 33:22.448
Imagine a reality where you
no longer have to accept

33:22.517 --> 33:24.717
the inevitable decline
of old age.

33:24.786 --> 33:26.619
That's right.
At the Namkha Clinic,

33:26.688 --> 33:28.221
we are the world leaders

33:28.289 --> 33:30.022
in cutting-edge life enhancement

33:30.091 --> 33:32.158
and bioregenerative therapies.

33:32.227 --> 33:35.094
Call us today if you want
to turn back the clock

33:35.163 --> 33:38.598
and stop Father Time
in his tracks.

33:38.666 --> 33:40.867
Always thought
Father Time was undefeated.

33:40.935 --> 33:42.268
Where do I sign up?

33:42.337 --> 33:43.814
Well, I don't think
that's gonna work, because,

33:43.838 --> 33:45.416
two years ago,
this guy's medical license

33:45.440 --> 33:47.760
was suspended after several claims
of malpractice.

33:47.761 --> 33:49.609
Including a patient who died

33:49.677 --> 33:51.210
in a clinic
he was running in Florida.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.424
He was reinstated six months
ago, and he set up shop here

33:53.448 --> 33:55.381
in Hawaii.
The guy is notorious

33:55.450 --> 33:57.817
for pushing the boundaries
of ethical science.

33:57.886 --> 33:59.018
And it looks like now

33:59.087 --> 34:01.154
he's taking the blood
of these young men

34:01.222 --> 34:03.422
and injecting it
into his rich clients,

34:03.491 --> 34:05.925
who are seeking, like,
the elixir of life.

34:05.994 --> 34:07.627
I understand Dr. Werner

34:07.695 --> 34:09.762
having access
to the HGH that Pacheo

34:09.831 --> 34:11.797
was trading for blood,

34:11.866 --> 34:13.466
not to mention the pyrovalerone.

34:13.534 --> 34:15.400
What I don't understand is
why the hell

34:15.469 --> 34:17.281
a guy would want to murder
one of his key suppliers.

34:17.304 --> 34:18.571
Wait a minute. Jerry,

34:18.639 --> 34:20.473
can you pull up
Pacheo's financials again,

34:20.542 --> 34:22.308
please?

34:23.411 --> 34:24.677
Check this out.

34:24.746 --> 34:28.347
You see how those payments
keep increasing?

34:28.416 --> 34:30.016
What if that was because Pacheo

34:30.083 --> 34:32.585
was squeezing Werner
for more and more money?

34:32.654 --> 34:34.665
Makes sense. I mean,
what the hell are you gonna do,

34:34.688 --> 34:35.621
go to the cops?

34:35.690 --> 34:36.856
Right.
Can't do that

34:36.925 --> 34:37.965
when your
business model is

34:37.992 --> 34:39.926
trading illegal
steroids for blood.

34:39.994 --> 34:41.928
Sounds like a motive
for murder to me.

34:41.996 --> 34:45.164
We need to pay
Dr. Werner a visit.

34:45.233 --> 34:47.244
<i>Five-O! Show me your hands!</i>

34:47.268 --> 34:48.701
Back it up!
Hey. Whoa, whoa. Okay.

34:48.770 --> 34:50.080
Put your weapons down!
Weapons down!

34:50.103 --> 34:51.270
On the ground. Now.

34:53.608 --> 34:54.373
Turn around.

34:54.442 --> 34:55.641
Turn around.

34:55.710 --> 34:58.110
Hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

35:37.968 --> 35:39.034
Tani.

35:41.138 --> 35:41.982
Okay.

35:41.983 --> 35:43.348
She has
an irregular pulse.

35:43.417 --> 35:45.183
Okay, she can't take
much more of this.

35:45.252 --> 35:46.562
This is Adam Noshimuri
with Five-O.

35:46.586 --> 35:48.298
I need an ambulance
at my location right away.

35:48.322 --> 35:49.632
No, no, no, no.
We can't do an ambulance.

35:49.656 --> 35:52.223
We need to do something
right now, Adam.

36:04.137 --> 36:06.004
Hey!

36:22.656 --> 36:24.122
Five-O! Don't move!

36:28.962 --> 36:31.930
Prison doctor will fix that
right up. Come on.

36:31.999 --> 36:34.199
Get your ass up. You ain't hurt.

36:37.704 --> 36:38.837
Paddles.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.372
Yeah.

36:45.946 --> 36:48.179
All right.

36:49.182 --> 36:51.583
Okay, Tani.

36:51.651 --> 36:53.218
Okay. Three,

36:53.286 --> 36:54.152
two, one.

36:54.221 --> 36:55.587
Clear.

37:02.696 --> 37:03.696
Okay.

37:03.730 --> 37:04.730
Move back.
Move back.

37:04.798 --> 37:05.830
What is that?

37:05.899 --> 37:07.298
Adrenaline.

37:15.675 --> 37:16.975
You okay?

37:32.759 --> 37:34.225
What's up, boss?
What's up?

37:34.294 --> 37:35.805
How you doing?
Can I get, uh, two Longboards,

37:35.829 --> 37:36.895
please?

37:36.963 --> 37:38.430
Rough day?

37:38.498 --> 37:40.365
Uh, well, yeah.
But, uh, no,

37:40.434 --> 37:43.368
I got a buddy of mine
coming to meet me.

37:43.437 --> 37:45.103
Thanks.

37:45.172 --> 37:46.382
You can just keep it open, yeah?

37:46.406 --> 37:49.741
♪ Satisfaction ♪

37:49.810 --> 37:51.342
Good evening.

37:51.411 --> 37:52.343
Hi.

37:52.412 --> 37:53.711
Do you mind
if I sit down?

37:53.780 --> 37:55.713
Uh, no, please.
Thank you.

37:55.782 --> 37:58.383
I, uh, thought you were having
dinner with Rachel and the kids.

37:58.452 --> 38:00.985
Yes, I am.
But I needed to see you first.

38:01.054 --> 38:02.054
Uh-huh.

38:02.122 --> 38:03.788
I feel like I'm being set up.

38:03.857 --> 38:05.323
Oh, no, no.

38:05.392 --> 38:07.792
I-I swiped Steven's phone.

38:07.861 --> 38:09.928
It was on the nightstand
next to the bed

38:09.996 --> 38:11.696
he was sleeping in with me.

38:11.765 --> 38:12.797
Oh.

38:12.866 --> 38:14.399
I'm just kidding you.

38:14.468 --> 38:15.834
No, I just--

38:15.902 --> 38:17.469
- I borrowed it.
- I-I see.

38:17.537 --> 38:20.338
And texted me from his phone
to get me to...

38:20.407 --> 38:22.941
Yes. I'm sorry about
all the subterfuge,

38:23.009 --> 38:25.343
but I had to have
a conversation with you,

38:25.412 --> 38:27.745
and I knew that
you'd say no if I asked.

38:27.814 --> 38:29.147
Here I am.

38:29.216 --> 38:30.682
What-what do you want
to talk about?

38:30.750 --> 38:33.084
Right.

38:33.153 --> 38:35.286
I know that you think that,

38:35.355 --> 38:36.955
when we first met,

38:37.023 --> 38:38.857
that I did not like you.

38:38.925 --> 38:40.592
Well, it's true.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.360
I didn't. I hated
you, actually.

38:42.429 --> 38:44.629
And not because of the
reasons that you say.

38:44.698 --> 38:46.498
Not because, um,
you're American

38:46.566 --> 38:49.200
or because you're
a man of modest means.

38:50.303 --> 38:52.437
It's because...

38:52.506 --> 38:54.372
you remind me of
where I was from.

38:56.076 --> 38:58.009
Excuse me?

38:59.179 --> 39:01.913
Well, I grew up
with three siblings

39:01.982 --> 39:05.517
in a two-bedroom
council house in London.

39:05.585 --> 39:09.854
My father was a honest
and hardworking man,

39:09.923 --> 39:11.322
and he loved his kids.

39:11.391 --> 39:12.991
And he told them
that every day.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.559
A bit-- a bit
like you do, Danny.

39:14.628 --> 39:18.730
But what I had
wasn't enough for me.

39:18.798 --> 39:20.665
I was always searching for...

39:20.734 --> 39:22.200
something else.

39:22.269 --> 39:24.602
You know, the light at
the end of the rainbow,

39:24.671 --> 39:26.471
the following the dream.

39:26.540 --> 39:28.439
Something more.
I think that's...

39:28.475 --> 39:32.043
why I got married
so many times.

39:32.112 --> 39:35.180
I was always looking for
a man as good as my father,

39:35.248 --> 39:36.781
but I could never...

39:36.850 --> 39:38.483
could never find him.

39:38.552 --> 39:41.986
And then when
Rachel found you,

39:42.055 --> 39:43.788
who was good, I...

39:43.857 --> 39:45.924
I think I was...

39:45.992 --> 39:46.925
jealous.

39:46.993 --> 39:49.594
Hmm.

39:49.663 --> 39:50.929
Okay?

39:50.997 --> 39:52.797
Right. So...

39:52.866 --> 39:55.967
now I will confess
something else.

39:56.036 --> 39:57.235
My bodyguard

39:57.304 --> 40:01.573
is not detained
in England.

40:01.641 --> 40:05.643
I used that as a ploy to come
here to see you and to have

40:05.712 --> 40:08.580
a talk with you about
something really important.

40:08.648 --> 40:10.582
Yeah?
Yeah.

40:10.650 --> 40:13.184
You-you didn't want to-- you
didn't want to just tell me that

40:13.253 --> 40:14.764
when you-- when you first saw me?

40:14.788 --> 40:16.199
You wanted to torture me
for the whole day?

40:16.223 --> 40:18.156
Torture you?
You sound like my agent.

40:18.225 --> 40:20.358
Mm.
No, I'm not gonna torture you.

40:20.427 --> 40:24.762
I'm just going to ask you
a very important question.

40:24.831 --> 40:28.566
Do you care about
my daughter, Daniel?

40:29.669 --> 40:31.669
Yes, I do.

40:31.738 --> 40:34.339
Well, good. Then don't toy
with her affections.

40:34.407 --> 40:37.041
I know that you two have
been seeing each other a lot,

40:37.110 --> 40:40.111
and I know that she is talking
about you all the time.

40:40.180 --> 40:42.947
So I don't want to see
her hurt again, okay?

40:43.016 --> 40:45.316
I want you to do
right by her.

40:45.385 --> 40:47.151
Will you do right by her?

40:47.220 --> 40:49.254
Yes.

40:50.357 --> 40:52.690
I think this calls
for a toast.

40:52.759 --> 40:55.226
Uh, yes. Uh, you want--
You feel free to have,

40:55.295 --> 40:56.894
uh...
Uh...

40:56.963 --> 40:58.674
- Oh, I don't think so.
- Or anything else you like. I could--

40:58.698 --> 41:00.109
I could order for you.
Well, that's very kind of you.

41:00.133 --> 41:03.468
Um, how about, um,
some champagne?

41:03.536 --> 41:05.503
Champagne. Please.
Coming up.

41:05.572 --> 41:08.006
Champagne it is then.
