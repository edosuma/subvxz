00:04.738 --> 00:06.505
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:10.743
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.745 --> 00:12.578
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.580 --> 00:15.180
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:18.017
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:20.019
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.021 --> 00:21.487
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.489 --> 00:22.721
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:22.723 --> 00:24.656
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:24.658 --> 00:26.492
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.660
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:28.662 --> 00:31.196
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:33.365
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.367 --> 00:35.701
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.703 --> 00:38.404
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.406 --> 00:40.372
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:47.280 --> 00:48.614
Toby:
<i>C-note says</i>

00:48.616 --> 00:49.715
He cuts down the alley.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.517
Sylvester:
Theory?
He stopped.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.352
With fear there's this
impulse to freeze,

00:53.354 --> 00:58.457
You ever catch a kid with
his hand in the cookie jar?

00:58.459 --> 01:00.225
I'm in for a hundred.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.795
Agents are moving in.

01:02.797 --> 01:04.630
(tires screeching)

01:05.832 --> 01:07.833
Got him.
(murmuring triumphantly)

01:07.835 --> 01:09.501
Hey, uh...
No, no, no, no, no!

01:09.503 --> 01:10.669
My analysis was right.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.304
He was about to go in the alley.

01:12.306 --> 01:13.305
Operative words:

01:13.307 --> 01:14.706
"about to."

01:14.708 --> 01:15.707
Pay up.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.810
So far,
we're batting a thousand.

01:17.812 --> 01:19.645
So far.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.080
Glad we could help.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.749
Uh, we did more than help.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.485
Without us tracing the
ip address of that
chinese national,

01:26.487 --> 01:29.788
You'd still have military
intel leaking like a sieve.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.824
Maybe it's time that we got
some publicity on this?

01:31.826 --> 01:34.326
Not likely.
It's hush-hush.

01:34.328 --> 01:37.629
Ah, it's always
hush-hush, huh?

01:37.631 --> 01:39.498
It's the nature of
the governmental beast.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.732
Going away?

01:40.734 --> 01:42.768
Yeah, we took a private job.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.837
A vegas casino--
the crimson.

01:44.839 --> 01:47.372
They've been losing money
on their high-roller

01:47.374 --> 01:48.540
Blackjack tables.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.109
They just want an analysis.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.110
Same-day trip.

01:52.812 --> 01:55.447
Can I have a word with you,
in private?

01:58.651 --> 02:01.420
Listen to me: You're not
ready to go out on your own.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.288
You only have a few
cases under your belt.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.823
We've delivered
results every time.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.892
With government assistance.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.861
How well was scorpion doing
before I came along?

02:08.863 --> 02:10.796
Classified
homeland security jobs

02:10.798 --> 02:12.898
Don't allow us to show people
what we're capable of.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.134
But I've got an investment
in you guys,

02:15.136 --> 02:16.301
And I don't want it compromised.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.770
I've had an investment

02:18.772 --> 02:21.840
In this team for years.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.375
I see its potential.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.544
Now, we agreed to work
with the government,

02:25.546 --> 02:26.812
Not    <i>f</i>the government.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.648
We   <i>ca</i>take private jobs,
so we are...

02:29.650 --> 02:32.284
Whether you think
we're ready or not.

02:36.589 --> 02:37.689
Toby:
<i>Tick-tock, people!</i>

02:37.691 --> 02:39.858
We're burning daylight here!

02:39.860 --> 02:43.462
Hey, diana ross,
they have hand soap there.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.930
Not anti-bacterial.

02:44.932 --> 02:48.167
Toby, I need you to run
a point on casino employee

02:48.169 --> 02:49.601
Background checks,
from the garage.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.837
From the garage
at the crimson?

02:51.839 --> 02:53.939
No, this garage.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.607
I'm sorry-- for a second,

02:55.609 --> 02:57.409
That sounded like you were
saying I can't go to vegas.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.944
I'm telling you I need you here.

02:58.946 --> 03:01.446
Guys, maybe we can
talk this out upstairs.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.282
This is a private job,
cabe's not involved

03:03.284 --> 03:05.617
So I am the boss,
and I don't want anything

03:05.619 --> 03:07.653
To possibly jeopardize
our contract.

03:07.655 --> 03:11.523
Oh... Oh, me being involved
jeopardizes the gig?

03:11.525 --> 03:12.858
I'll stay.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.326
No-- you want
to avoid the flight,

03:14.328 --> 03:15.794
Your gambling is
a liability.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.696
You will become
distracted in vegas,

03:17.698 --> 03:19.665
And we need to put
our best foot forward.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.533
Walter, come on-- you waited
till the last minute

03:21.535 --> 03:22.768
To tell him about this?

03:22.770 --> 03:23.969
I knew this would happen.

03:23.971 --> 03:25.704
This job is
a big deal for us.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.406
It's a big deal
for all of us.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.607
Sylvester doesn't
want to fly,

03:28.609 --> 03:30.542
I'm anxious as hell
about leaving ralph

03:30.544 --> 03:32.611
With a sitter while
I'm in a different state...

03:32.613 --> 03:33.812
You are worried about toby.

03:33.814 --> 03:34.880
We're all anxious.

03:34.882 --> 03:37.449
But we're all going
as a team, okay?

03:37.451 --> 03:38.483
Fine.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.385
You know what?
You can be the one

03:40.387 --> 03:42.487
Who gives him a loan
at the craps table.

03:45.491 --> 03:49.595
â™ª

03:53.566 --> 03:55.601
Toby: Oh, do you hear that?
Do you know what that sound is?

03:55.603 --> 03:57.636
Happy: Daddy losing
the mortgage payment?

03:57.638 --> 04:00.272
The sound of money,
soon to be my money.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.506
You know they have
magic shows here.

04:01.508 --> 04:02.841
Maybe we can go see one.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.844
Ugh. I'm not gonna go anywhere
with you in that shirt.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.713
I can't help it
if flying makes me sick.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.481
That shirt makes me sick.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.917
Oh, when we're done,
I am gonna make my own magic

04:11.919 --> 04:14.353
At the card tables.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.954
You wanna bet?

04:15.956 --> 04:18.423
I'll give you a bet:
You resist gambling

04:18.425 --> 04:20.759
While you're here, I will give
you my paycheck for this job.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.263
But, if you make
a single wager...

04:24.265 --> 04:25.831
I will get yours.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.699
Yeah, you think you're smart

04:27.701 --> 04:28.967
Betting me I won't bet.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.335
Mm!

04:30.337 --> 04:33.038
I'm in,
'cause the only thing sweeter

04:33.040 --> 04:35.040
Than winning cash will be
winning it from you.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.041
We're on.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.909
Mr. O'brien?
Yes.

04:37.911 --> 04:38.977
Renee connelly.
We spoke on the phone.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.012
Oh, hi.
Nice to meet you.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.013
Uh, this is my team...
Hi.

04:41.015 --> 04:42.014
We're excited
to get started.

04:42.016 --> 04:46.351
My father bob was very
impressed by your proposal.

04:46.353 --> 04:47.919
Specifically,
your statistical game theory

04:47.921 --> 04:49.721
And analysis of
behavioral patterns.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.291
Now, we're really hoping
you can help us find out

04:52.293 --> 04:53.592
Why our
highest-take tables

04:53.594 --> 04:54.626
Are down 1.8 percent,

04:54.628 --> 04:56.928
When we have a house edge
of .28%

04:56.930 --> 04:58.997
With a standard deviation
of 1.15.

04:58.999 --> 05:02.367
Been in the family business
since I was 15.

05:02.369 --> 05:04.036
Know it like the odds
of a dealt straight.

05:04.038 --> 05:06.004
Both:
254 to one.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.473
Remind me to keep you guys
away from our tables.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.042
No, no, no,
we're here to work.

05:10.044 --> 05:12.978
We'll just get settled
in our room and start.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.746
Did you book a room?
Yes.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.382
Oh, no, no, we have that
all taken care of.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.451
My dad's been
trying to get

05:19.453 --> 05:22.087
A 50,000-square-foot
expansion off the ground--

05:22.089 --> 05:23.889
Concerts, private events--

05:23.891 --> 05:25.857
He's spread himself so thin,
you can see right through him.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.359
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.828
We can't really afford
to lose a dime at the tables.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.997
Okay, guys, while your suite's
being prepared,

05:31.999 --> 05:33.832
We have reserved this cabana
for you.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.500
All meals are on us,
so just make yourselves at--

05:35.502 --> 05:36.568
(phone rings)

05:36.570 --> 05:37.602
Hold on one moment, please.

05:37.604 --> 05:41.406
Oh! Wouldn't want these
to go to waste. Mmm!

05:42.475 --> 05:44.409
It's mojito,
it's very good.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.410
Guys, can we dial it down
a notch, please?

05:45.412 --> 05:48.113
Paige, help me out here.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.649
What?
I'm a single mom.

05:50.651 --> 05:51.817
I'm never coming back here.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.653
But I can get you up
to the penthouse now.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.055
Yes? Okay. Right this way.
Lead the way.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.392
What do you think?

06:00.394 --> 06:01.593
Well, this is subtle.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.929
I'm so happy.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.731
Woman: If you need anything,
miss connelly said

06:05.733 --> 06:06.765
You should
call her personally,

06:06.767 --> 06:07.766
And she'll take care of it.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.368
Thank you.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.837
I have waited for this
my whole life.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.741
Can you take a quick pic,
so I can text it to ralph?

06:15.743 --> 06:17.008
Oh, wait-- here.

06:18.611 --> 06:19.945
(camera clicks)

06:19.947 --> 06:22.781
Sylvester:
I don't believe it.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.049
This bed is sterile.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.584
Let's see what's on
the no-pay-per-view.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.120
'cause it's comped-- get it?

06:29.989 --> 06:31.123
Dude...?!

06:31.125 --> 06:33.091
Dude... We're here to work,

06:33.093 --> 06:34.826
Remember?

06:36.562 --> 06:40.132
Now, there's 1.65 times 10
to the 365th power decks

06:40.134 --> 06:43.068
We need to know
all of them to find out

06:43.070 --> 06:44.636
Why the crimson
is losing money.

06:44.638 --> 06:48.440
Only you could turn blackjack
into math homework.

06:48.442 --> 06:49.808
I like math homework.

06:50.643 --> 06:51.843
(dials phone)

06:51.845 --> 06:52.844
Hi, renee.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.646
I was wondering
if we could meet

06:54.648 --> 06:55.881
With him sooner
rather than later?

06:55.883 --> 06:58.183
Yes! Yeah. Great.
Thank you.

06:58.185 --> 07:01.153
Okay, guys, let's uh...
(chuckles) let's go.

07:01.155 --> 07:03.088
Yeah! Wouldn't want to spend
more than two minutes

07:03.090 --> 07:05.056
In the luxury suite.
Let's go.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.464
That's $100 a square yard.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.533
How much are you losing
per day, at the tables?

07:14.535 --> 07:16.535
Fair enough.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.137
Now, to avoid the cost
of re-wiring your ceiling cams,

07:19.139 --> 07:21.072
These pressure pads,
going under the carpet,

07:21.074 --> 07:23.909
Will be linked to a brownian
motion program I developed.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.210
It's based on
the principle that people

07:25.212 --> 07:27.946
Naturally move
in random patterns.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.581
Well, what if they move around
in non-random patterns?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.149
Then they're ripping you off.

07:32.885 --> 07:34.119
Tell me: Where the hell's
my money gone?

07:34.121 --> 07:38.857
Okay, 11 players at three
tables, some multiple hands,

07:38.859 --> 07:41.193
Player success rate
is above standard,

07:41.195 --> 07:42.194
But the wage rate
hasn't deviated,

07:42.196 --> 07:43.195
Since face card
turnover's low.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.096
Okay, so no card counters.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.598
Toby, what about
dealer collusion?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.700
I'm not reading
any distraction behavior.

07:48.702 --> 07:52.604
Dealer shuffles look
standard, per normalizer.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.105
No second deals,

07:54.107 --> 07:56.575
High-low pickups,
or card swaps.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.243
Walter: All right,
pattern from the pressure pads

07:58.245 --> 08:02.247
So no one seems to be signaling
a player from a distance.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.483
I'm sorry, do you have
any other angles on that table?

08:05.952 --> 08:08.553
Move cameras 14 and 15
to high-roll blackjack two.

08:08.555 --> 08:10.055
Can you zoom in his hands?

08:10.057 --> 08:12.090
Zoom in on that.

08:15.127 --> 08:17.028
(scoffs)
that dealer right there.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.965
Him-- he's the reason why
you're losing money.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.640
Mr. Connelly,
what's going on?

08:28.642 --> 08:30.675
I didn't do anything,
I swear.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.877
Yeah, ronny, uh...

08:31.879 --> 08:33.278
I got an expert here

08:33.280 --> 08:35.814
Who says your table's
been losing us money.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.148
I got a family,
I need this job.

08:37.150 --> 08:38.149
I wouldn't steal.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.284
Oh, no... No, no.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.785
He was telling the truth.

08:40.787 --> 08:42.187
He wasn't stealing.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.555
Can I see
your hands, please?

08:43.557 --> 08:46.057
Yes? Uh... Thank you.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.158
Yeah, yeah.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.961
Now, despite ronny's stature,

08:49.963 --> 08:51.296
He has below-average
sized hands,

08:51.298 --> 08:53.231
Which result in
small index fingers,

08:53.233 --> 08:55.033
Which result in
slow dealer speed.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.068
Which results in
fewer deals per hour.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.204
Which results in
cumulatively large losses.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.973
I'm losing money 'cause
this guy's got small mitts?

09:01.975 --> 09:04.042
Yeah, but I just saved you
a fortune in future losses.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.544
You just have to fire
this gentleman.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.546
What?!
It's nothing personal.

09:07.548 --> 09:10.181
You're just not fit for
jobs where hand speed,

09:10.183 --> 09:11.182
Dexterity are paramount.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.784
You're a detriment here.

09:14.954 --> 09:16.888
I'm sorry, ronny.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.190
Mr. Connelly... (stammers)

09:19.192 --> 09:20.926
Please... (stammers)

09:20.928 --> 09:22.193
This isn't right!
This isn't fair!

09:23.996 --> 09:25.764
Hey... Quick rundown.
Mm-hmm?

09:25.766 --> 09:28.567
You were rude to toby
at the garage,

09:28.569 --> 09:31.002
Insensitive to sylvester's
fear of flying,

09:31.004 --> 09:32.771
And uncaring about
that dealer's livelihood.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.240
We were hired to solve
a problem, which we did,

09:35.242 --> 09:37.709
Like professionals,
which we are.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.280
Walter: So we've upgraded
your security software.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.282
You should be more secure
than you were yesterday.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.651
Mr. Connelly: Terrific job.
You know, it's rare these days

09:46.653 --> 09:48.954
Somebody actually delivers on
everything they've promised.

09:48.956 --> 09:49.955
Thank you.

09:49.957 --> 09:50.956
Well, that's very kind
of you.

09:50.958 --> 09:51.957
Call us whenever
you need us.

09:51.959 --> 09:52.958
We will.

09:52.960 --> 09:53.959
Okay. Hey.
Thank you.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.327
Great job.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.663
Sylvester:
Well, I can't wait to leave.

09:58.665 --> 10:01.333
The smoke in these places
makes me dizzy.

10:01.335 --> 10:02.601
We've got some time
before the plane departs.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.135
I'm gonna go hit up
some slots.

10:04.137 --> 10:05.704
No, no, no, you need
to remove the pressure pads.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.038
Paige:
There's enough time

10:07.040 --> 10:08.173
For her to both, walter.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.174
The job's over.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.375
Let your team
have some fun.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.744
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.746
Go have fun,
I'll pack up.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.281
I'll go with you-- I told ralph
I'd play a couple games.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.616
Fine.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.284
But if she's a cooler,
I'm peeling off.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.753
Hey, they face the loosest slots
towards the entrance

10:21.755 --> 10:23.388
To draw in players, so...

10:24.624 --> 10:26.024
I'm like a blind man
at a peep show.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.025
What's the point?
Mm.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.259
(slot machine blipping)

10:29.996 --> 10:33.064
Toby: Grandma won a $40,000
progressive jackpot.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.633
Isn't that nice?

10:34.635 --> 10:36.768
Guys, those two men
in baseball hats,

10:36.770 --> 10:38.370
They're going against the grain
of the crowd movement.

10:38.372 --> 10:40.405
They're up to something.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.774
Toby: Rigid body language,
heads down, checking phones,

10:42.776 --> 10:44.909
Clearly anticipating
something.

10:48.247 --> 10:49.347
Be cool, guys.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.683
A robbery's about
to go down.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.653
Man:
Everyone on the ground!

10:55.421 --> 10:56.321
(people shouting, screaming)

10:56.323 --> 10:59.224
Happy:
Watch out!

10:59.226 --> 11:01.660
Stay down! Stay down!

11:01.662 --> 11:04.329
Stay down! Don't look up!
Stay down!

11:07.199 --> 11:08.299
If I see eyes,

11:08.301 --> 11:10.669
I'm putting a bullet in them!

11:27.119 --> 11:29.821
(garbled radio transmission)

11:29.823 --> 11:31.823
It could have been me.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.792
Thank you.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.961
I calculated the trajectory of
the bullet and muzzle length,

11:36.963 --> 11:39.030
Relative to the
position of your torso.

11:39.032 --> 11:43.134
And you knew it would only
graze the guy behind me?

11:43.136 --> 11:44.703
I didn't calculate
his position.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.337
I'm a genius,
not superman.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.706
Walter.
Walter:
Hi.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.174
This is detective lou rake.

11:49.176 --> 11:50.341
Oh, hi, detective.
Yeah, how you
doing, mr. O'brien?

11:50.343 --> 11:51.710
Good.
Tell me
what you saw.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.812
Uh, yes, before
the gunmen entered,

11:53.814 --> 11:57.916
There were two men, baseball
caps, casing the money cart.
Hmm.

11:57.918 --> 12:01.186
So, we know the masked men
entered through the main lobby.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.487
The odd thing is,

12:02.489 --> 12:05.090
The exterior cameras
didn't see them leaving.

12:05.092 --> 12:07.025
No sign at all.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.159
They could still be
in the casino?

12:08.161 --> 12:10.195
Well, unis are doing
a second sweep,

12:10.197 --> 12:12.230
But it's more likely
they left another way.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.398
How is that possible?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.766
You tell me.

12:14.768 --> 12:18.970
Got involved with the security
system just before the robbery.

12:18.972 --> 12:23.074
Mr. Connelly, you can't think
I have anything to do with this?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.443
Those cameras you asked
to be turned on a table

12:25.445 --> 12:27.512
Created a temporary blind spot.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.980
Oh, I was just doing my job.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.182
Now I'm just out
ten million bucks.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.084
You-- what
did you see?

12:33.086 --> 12:35.186
Uh, uh, uh. He's already
vomited once today.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.155
He was face-down on the floor
like everyone else.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.323
What could he see?

12:38.325 --> 12:39.491
That's it. That's it.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.092
We were all on the ground.
No one moved

12:41.094 --> 12:43.161
Except for the robbers.
We still have

12:43.163 --> 12:44.529
Those heat sensors
under the carpet.

12:44.531 --> 12:49.167
But the software shows footsteps
coming into... This room

12:49.169 --> 12:50.168
At the time of
the robbery?

12:50.170 --> 12:51.202
There has to be
a back exit.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.338
No. It's a storage room.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.773
One door.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.241
Why would they come in here?

12:56.243 --> 12:58.243
Well, maybe to put on
your invisibility cloaks?

12:58.245 --> 13:00.879
For the last time, we had
nothing to do with the robbery.

13:00.881 --> 13:02.147
Security officer:
Uh, sir?

13:02.149 --> 13:03.448
We were able
to isolate something

13:03.450 --> 13:05.216
On the casino's mics.
Oh, play it, play it.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.251
Yes, sir.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.519
Walter:
Be cool, guys.

13:07.521 --> 13:10.121
A robbery's about to go down.

13:14.193 --> 13:15.794
No, no.

13:15.796 --> 13:19.197
No, I know, you were
just settling your crew

13:19.199 --> 13:20.565
Before your pals came in
with guns.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.000
That's ridiculous.

13:22.002 --> 13:25.470
You scoped out the room,
you repositioned the cameras,

13:25.472 --> 13:26.905
And you were able
to call the score

13:26.907 --> 13:30.175
I observed abnormal
behavior patterns,

13:30.177 --> 13:31.576
And I warned my friends.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.112
Well, pardon me if
I have trouble believing that.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.480
Now you're gonna stay here.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.382
I'm gonna get a warrant
to search your room.

13:37.384 --> 13:39.083
You know what,
you don't need a warrant,

13:39.085 --> 13:40.285
And when you don't
find anything,

13:40.287 --> 13:43.154
I expect an apology.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.289
All right, let's get to it.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.124
Everything checked, everything.

13:46.126 --> 13:48.226
Oh, not the bed.
It was so clean.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.295
(indistinct radio transmission)

13:50.297 --> 13:53.298
No, absolutely not.
Under no circumstances

13:53.300 --> 13:55.133
Are we calling cabe.
Stop being stubborn.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.301
This is serious.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.435
They're not gonna
find anything.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.304
We didn't rob
anyone, remember?

13:59.306 --> 14:00.905
Detective rake.

14:00.907 --> 14:03.208
Rake:
Step away, please.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.211
Thank you.

14:06.213 --> 14:10.281
Oh, the serial numbers match
the lot from the cash card.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.349
Whose bag is this?
It's mine,

14:11.351 --> 14:12.584
But I didn't take that money.

14:12.586 --> 14:14.018
So it just magically appeared

14:14.020 --> 14:16.387
The way those robbers
magically disappeared?

14:16.389 --> 14:20.592
I have never committed a crime
in my life.

14:20.594 --> 14:23.194
Well, you did hack into nasa.
Shut up.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.429
Cuff him.

14:24.431 --> 14:25.530
You can't arrest him.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.298
Actually, I can.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.967
Oh,

14:28.969 --> 14:31.135
Don't hold your breath
for that apology.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.137
You're under arrest,
mr. O'brien.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.206
Excuse me.

14:40.312 --> 14:43.147
This is ridiculous;
I'm calling cabe.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.382
I am your employer.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.483
I'm telling you no.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.585
We're a professional company.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.321
We can handle this
without calling cabe.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.623
You're in handcuffs.

14:51.625 --> 14:54.425
I have a plan; don't worry.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.361
Mr. O'brien,
I understand you waived

14:56.363 --> 14:57.896
Your public defender.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.430
Correct, yes. I-I don't need one

14:59.432 --> 15:01.666
Since this court can't
provide me with a fair trial.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.601
You see,
it's my constitutional right

15:03.603 --> 15:05.236
To a jury of my peers.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.038
Which means you'd need
to find 12 residents

15:07.040 --> 15:09.941
Of clark county, nevada,
with an iq of 197 or above,

15:09.943 --> 15:11.276
And I've spent some time
in clark county.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.977
I can tell you
that's not gonna happen.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.245
Not good.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.480
There's no option
but to release me.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.048
Mm-hmm.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.284
Bail is set at 500,000.
(gavel bangs)

15:19.286 --> 15:20.685
Your honor, on what grounds?

15:20.687 --> 15:23.922
I consider your enormous iq

15:23.924 --> 15:26.057
A contributing factor
to flight risk.

15:26.059 --> 15:27.325
Next case.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.326
Uh, this is insane.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.328
Your honor, your...

15:30.330 --> 15:31.996
Toby, go get my bail money.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.364
Toby, win my bail money.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.033
Toby, the bet's off. Toby!

15:35.035 --> 15:36.567
Toby, the bet's off!

15:45.978 --> 15:47.545
(sighs) I'd skip
the black light app in here.

15:47.547 --> 15:52.183
Okay, so we've got to figure out
how we're spring walter.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.584
You heard him;
I'm gambling him out.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.553
No, I've seen you
after a two-day crap bender.

15:55.555 --> 15:56.955
You get nuts
and lose judgment,

15:56.957 --> 15:58.423
And I do not trust you
doubling down

15:58.425 --> 15:59.490
On walter's freedom.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.491
Speaking of which,
we only have,

16:00.493 --> 16:03.094
Until county clerk office closes
at 5:00.

16:03.096 --> 16:04.362
He'll be held in there
all weekend,

16:04.364 --> 16:06.230
And the longer he's in there,

16:06.232 --> 16:07.498
The better the chance
the evidence

16:07.500 --> 16:09.133
That could clear him
will be lost or destroyed.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.635
Why is that?

16:10.637 --> 16:12.603
If anyone could find out
who framed him, he can.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.639
Why do you think
only walter can solve this?

16:14.641 --> 16:16.474
I mean, who ruined you?

16:16.476 --> 16:17.742
My dad.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.610
It was rhetorical.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.580
If we bail walter out without
figuring out who set him up,

16:22.582 --> 16:25.083
He's just gonna go to trial
eventually and get convicted.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.584
We need to find out
who framed him.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.152
Wrong. This is triage.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.188
We need to get him out
before anything else.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.556
I disagree.
I'm not sure.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.524
Well, I'm not surprised.
Oh, my god, enough!

16:33.526 --> 16:35.326
You guys have been
without walter ten minutes,

16:35.328 --> 16:36.995
And you're already at
each other's throats.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.063
Can you win the money
fast enough, yes or no?

16:39.065 --> 16:41.432
I got 112 bucks. Sylvester?

16:44.036 --> 16:46.104
I have $80,
but if I'm counting cards

16:46.106 --> 16:48.673
To avoid detection,
I need to keep my bets small.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.475
It could take all weekend
to raise the cash

16:50.477 --> 16:51.642
That we need.
Which is why you

16:51.644 --> 16:53.111
Are gonna moneyball
the sports book.

16:53.113 --> 16:55.113
Start memorizing players fast.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.381
If you and I can somehow see

16:56.383 --> 16:58.449
The surveillance footage
outside our suite,

16:58.451 --> 17:00.518
Maybe we'll spot who planted
that money in walter's bag.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.154
This is ridiculous;
I'm completely innocent.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.456
I know.
You're the 43rd innocent person

17:05.458 --> 17:07.091
I've booked this week.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.659
And I didn't steal no jewelry.

17:08.661 --> 17:09.560
I'm innocent, too.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.295
Like this guy.

17:11.297 --> 17:13.031
Well, that's not true.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.599
The cuts on his knuckles
are straight,

17:14.601 --> 17:16.634
Probably from smashing
a window or a display case,

17:16.636 --> 17:18.703
But the ones on his fingertips,
they're jagged.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.405
The kind you get
from the sharpened edges

17:20.407 --> 17:24.275
You been picking up precious
stones sometime recently?

17:27.646 --> 17:28.646
I'll kill you!
Whoa!

17:28.648 --> 17:29.547
I'll kill you!

17:29.549 --> 17:31.349
Whoa.
You're dead!

17:31.351 --> 17:32.650
You're dead!

17:32.652 --> 17:34.185
You're dead, smart ass!

17:34.187 --> 17:36.754
Well, mr. Geologist,

17:36.756 --> 17:38.423
If I put you in the gen pop
with him,

17:38.425 --> 17:41.526
Looks like you bunking
in the drunk tank.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.661
That sounds lovely.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.496
All right, ladies,
I was able to pull the film,

17:45.498 --> 17:47.331
But I only did this
to make a point.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.599
(computer beeps)

17:48.601 --> 17:51.536
No one in or out of the room
from the time you left

17:51.538 --> 17:53.538
Until we came back
to search for it.

17:53.540 --> 17:54.739
You said you had
a point to make.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.808
Yeah, you're all in on it.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.743
We only found cash
in your pal's bag,

17:58.745 --> 18:00.711
And you turn on him,
I'll talk to the d.A.,

18:00.713 --> 18:02.680
Get you a deal. You don't,

18:02.682 --> 18:04.115
I'm gonna go after each
and every one of you.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.716
Absolutely not.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.585
Look, that window.
The angle's

18:07.587 --> 18:09.720
From a different floor
from the floor we were on.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.457
Give me that picture
we took for ralph.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.558
Here.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.762
She posed in our suite.
Our floor

18:17.764 --> 18:20.431
Was perfectly aligned with
the tiger's eyes on the casino

18:20.433 --> 18:22.400
Across the street.
The angle on this footage

18:22.402 --> 18:23.868
Is by its mouth.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.636
This camera was on
another floor.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.272
Someone spliced these tapes.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.540
I'm gonna have to look
into this.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.641
You do that.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.278
(whispering):
That was so badass.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.247
Whoever framed walter
is desperate enough

18:36.249 --> 18:38.249
To fudge film and then
give it to the cops.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.818
The problem is, vegas is full
of desperate people.

18:42.721 --> 18:45.256
Check it out.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.258
A public hearing announcement
for the crimson expansion

18:47.260 --> 18:48.659
Building permits.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.828
Renee said her dad was spread
real thin financially.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.897
Sounds pretty desperate to me.

18:55.667 --> 18:58.336
Happy:
Hey, are the permit applications

18:58.338 --> 19:00.738
For the crimson expansion
public record?

19:01.807 --> 19:03.374
Great. We'd like copies

19:03.376 --> 19:04.842
Of everything you have.

19:07.679 --> 19:09.380
Oh, look at texas over here.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.748
Oh! Seven!

19:13.652 --> 19:14.819
500 on the over.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.621
(indistinct tv announcements)

19:18.423 --> 19:20.324
You're beautiful,
but you don't have an eight.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.726
Well, this is fun!

19:22.528 --> 19:23.861
50 across the board

19:23.863 --> 19:25.796
On the nine horse.
(grunting)

19:25.798 --> 19:27.832
What's the fourth quarter spread
on the new york game?

19:28.800 --> 19:30.801
Got my face with an ace!

19:31.436 --> 19:32.603
Oh, my god!

19:32.605 --> 19:34.739
25... No, 50.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.507
Give me a club
so I can beat you with it.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.242
Who plays nine-eight suited?

19:38.244 --> 19:40.611
Eight grand on cuppa coffee.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.246
(whoops)
gonna hurt my rotator cuff

19:42.248 --> 19:44.882
From repeating this motion
over and over.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.851
Come on, cuppa coffee.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.686
Come on, cuppa coffee.
Come on.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.454
Let's go, cuppa coffee!
Let's go!

19:50.456 --> 19:51.889
Come on, cuppa coffee!

19:51.891 --> 19:54.325
Got to the whip!
Go to the whip, cuppa coffee!

19:55.460 --> 19:56.761
Wire!

19:56.763 --> 19:59.297
(groans)
okay.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.865
Okay.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.667
I'm okay.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.602
I'm okay.

20:04.604 --> 20:05.736
(sighs)

20:05.738 --> 20:08.339
Thank you very much.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.907
Ow.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.212
(groaning)

20:14.214 --> 20:16.247
Uh, excuse me, excuse me.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.749
Uh, yeah, I think I'd be
better off with the jewel thief.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.384
I'll tell the concierge

20:20.386 --> 20:21.953
You're unhappy
with your accommodation.

20:25.257 --> 20:26.624
(door slams)

20:26.626 --> 20:29.794
Okay, so we've got $250,000,

20:29.796 --> 20:31.429
Which is half of what we need.

20:31.431 --> 20:32.597
All new games are starting,

20:32.599 --> 20:33.898
And they're gonna be over
past 5:00,

20:33.900 --> 20:35.733
Which is too late
to bail walter out.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.535
I'm radioactive
in the poker room.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.769
No one's gonna go near me now.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.938
I was on fire, man.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.940
That's great, but what do we do?

20:42.942 --> 20:44.942
We only have 40 minutes left.

20:47.679 --> 20:49.313
I can double it at
the roulette wheel.

20:49.315 --> 20:50.848
Toby, I don't think

20:50.850 --> 20:52.016
That's a good idea.

20:52.018 --> 20:55.319
Toby, you cannot read
a roulette wheel.

20:55.321 --> 20:56.721
Like hell I can't.

20:56.723 --> 20:57.822
Toby!

20:57.824 --> 20:59.390
Hey!

20:59.392 --> 21:01.892
I thought you guys were gambling
down the street.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.894
Toby said this place
had better odds.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.596
Sylvester, we think
we found something.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.898
We found records that
bob connelly's massive expansion

21:07.900 --> 21:10.568
Has been held up for months
due to permit issues

21:10.570 --> 21:11.702
Until very recently.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.870
You think he paid someone off?

21:12.872 --> 21:15.806
The payoff was
practically invented here.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.975
The guy's tight on cash;
his own daughter said so.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.011
It's possible the robbery
is really an insurance scam

21:20.013 --> 21:22.013
To cover the cost
of a permit bribe.

21:22.015 --> 21:23.347
Where's toby?

21:23.349 --> 21:25.950
That's a bit of a problem.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.457
What the hell
are you doing?

21:33.459 --> 21:34.892
Look at how she holds the ball,

21:34.894 --> 21:35.893
So gingerly and lightly.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.428
She's a gentle soul.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.297
It's fascinating.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.731
We'll get the rest
of the money another way.

21:40.733 --> 21:41.899
She always drops
the ball opposite a red.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.634
Maybe her first car was red

21:43.636 --> 21:45.636
Or her mom always
wore red lipstick.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.505
Either way, I got this pegged.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.340
No, you don't. Let's
take the money we have

21:49.342 --> 21:50.641
And get out of here.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.477
Okay, paige.

21:56.948 --> 21:58.683
I got this.
No, no, no.
No, no. Toby.

21:58.685 --> 21:59.817
Toby, toby, to...
(toby groans)

21:59.819 --> 22:00.951
Toby.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.553
No.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.921
Dealer:
That's it. No more bets.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.356
I don't even
want to look.

22:06.692 --> 22:09.026
(grunts)

22:10.595 --> 22:11.996
Hmm?

22:12.964 --> 22:15.533
(grunts, sighs)

22:15.535 --> 22:17.668
You.
Good to see you
again, ronny.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.004
Of all the gin joints,

22:20.006 --> 22:22.640
Einstein has to walk
into mine.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.442
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Officer:
O'brien.

22:28.113 --> 22:30.381
Lawyer's here to see you.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.821
Thank you.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.756
All right. All right.

22:45.997 --> 22:48.032
You don't have the bail money.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.501
We almost had it. I thought I
could get us there at the wheel.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.002
You lost it all on one bet?

22:52.004 --> 22:55.139
We're not going to be able
to get you out for the weekend.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.807
Hey, you're the one
that sent me in there.

22:56.809 --> 22:57.975
You had to show off, right?

22:57.977 --> 22:59.510
Win too much too fast,

22:59.512 --> 23:02.046
Probably got iced out
in the poker room.

23:02.048 --> 23:05.116
The one time I need you
to come through for me, toby.

23:05.118 --> 23:07.051
We almost had it.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.987
I could feel
that we almost had it.

23:09.989 --> 23:12.056
I've heard your pathetic
gambling war stories for...

23:12.058 --> 23:13.958
This wasn't intentional, walter.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.893
We have a legitimate
company, toby.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.728
A chance to grow something.

23:17.730 --> 23:18.929
A chance to show...

23:18.931 --> 23:20.531
Show who? Hmm?

23:20.533 --> 23:22.833
Show who? Cabe?

23:22.835 --> 23:24.969
Your father figure
that you've just been

23:24.971 --> 23:27.705
Shaking your ass for since he
wandered into the garage.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.473
"oh, look at me, dad.

23:29.475 --> 23:31.475
"I'm on the high dive.
Look at me, pop.

23:31.477 --> 23:33.144
I can run my own company."

23:33.146 --> 23:35.112
Save your psychoanalysis
for your patients.

23:35.114 --> 23:36.881
How many times

23:36.883 --> 23:38.616
Have I literally
and figuratively

23:38.618 --> 23:40.084
Had to bail you out?

23:40.086 --> 23:42.019
I'm not the one who got you
into this mess.

23:42.021 --> 23:44.088
I'm the one who had to dig
through a salvation army bin

23:44.090 --> 23:45.990
So I could pass
as a lawyer and talk to you.

23:45.992 --> 23:48.058
To tell me what?
That you messed up again?

23:48.060 --> 23:49.860
You're just always right.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.596
And you love telling
everybody that you're right,

23:52.598 --> 23:54.498
Reminding people
that you're right,

23:54.500 --> 23:56.700
Showing everyone,
"hey, hey, I'm right."

23:56.702 --> 23:58.169
No.

23:58.171 --> 23:59.703
I'm not always right.

23:59.705 --> 24:01.138
I thought I could count on you.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.442
I sure wasn't right about that.

24:09.915 --> 24:11.982
Sylvester, where
are we now?

24:11.984 --> 24:16.120
The potentialities of
exonerating walter are terrible.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.856
Really?

24:18.858 --> 24:20.891
There's a lot of negative vibes
in this room right now.

24:20.893 --> 24:22.193
I think a beer might help.

24:22.195 --> 24:23.561
What would have helped was you

24:23.563 --> 24:24.995
Not gambling away
the bail money.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.130
You know, everyone's acting

24:26.132 --> 24:28.098
Like we were applying
for a bank loan.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.668
We were gambling.
There's risk involved.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.136
No, we're not going
through with this again.

24:32.138 --> 24:35.473
A second time
isn't an option.

24:36.241 --> 24:38.175
Yes.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.144
Are you our new walter?

24:40.146 --> 24:42.913
You brainiacs can't agree on
anything, so I'm stepping up.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.148
Toby:
Okay.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.950
What's our plan, boss?

24:45.952 --> 24:50.521
Bob connelly was overextended,
so it's possible either he

24:50.523 --> 24:52.122
Or someone
working for him

24:52.124 --> 24:54.258
Put the money
in... In his bag.

24:54.260 --> 24:57.127
If we can prove
he was in the red,

24:57.129 --> 25:00.664
It might establish motive
to frame walter.

25:00.666 --> 25:03.667
That is an interesting theory,
but we can't hack

25:03.669 --> 25:04.869
Into connelly's
financial records

25:04.871 --> 25:06.170
Because walter just had to go

25:06.172 --> 25:07.705
And install
his security overlay.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.773
You can't hack
your own software?

25:09.775 --> 25:11.041
Toby: Uh-uh.
Sylvester: No, it's
walter software.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.576
We could follow the steps,

25:12.578 --> 25:14.645
But it's millions
of lines of code.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.947
Okay.
There is another way.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.048
I might be
able to sniff

25:18.050 --> 25:21.051
We would have to attach
a remote-frequency jump drive

25:21.053 --> 25:23.053
With a vpn to
connelly's computer

25:23.055 --> 25:25.122
And one to my laptop, and then
they could speak to each other.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.123
They could transfer data.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.691
The crimson thinks

25:27.693 --> 25:30.127
We just robbed them
of $10 million.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.296
Can't just walk in
through the front door.

25:32.298 --> 25:34.098
Then we won't use
the front door.

25:35.166 --> 25:37.902
You cost me my job.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.803
I now regret
that decision.

25:39.805 --> 25:41.005
I hit the scotch.

25:41.007 --> 25:43.173
I got busted
for public intoxication.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.742
To be fair,
that part is your fault.

25:44.744 --> 25:48.078
Let's see how my small hands
look around your neck.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.813
Apologies in advance.

25:52.284 --> 25:54.218
I'm feeling sick.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.587
I'm pulling your focus
with my fingers.

25:56.589 --> 25:57.922
Foreground/background
optical adjustment's

25:57.924 --> 26:00.190
Affected greatly
when intoxicated.

26:01.760 --> 26:05.229
Thus causing the onset of spins.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.831
I'm gonna barf.

26:09.100 --> 26:10.901
(sighs heavily)

26:10.903 --> 26:12.570
(gasping)

26:12.572 --> 26:15.739
Just take long,
deep breaths.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.775
(sighs)

26:21.146 --> 26:22.880
(chuckles)

26:22.882 --> 26:24.848
I know you hate me, ronny.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.718
But you're gonna have to keep
your hands off my neck.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.820
I can evaluate your skills,

26:29.822 --> 26:31.822
Help to set you
on a better career path.

26:33.658 --> 26:36.360
(stifled retching)

26:36.362 --> 26:38.062
Okay. Oh, no, no, no, no.

26:38.064 --> 26:39.363
(gags) oh, god.

26:46.037 --> 26:47.938
(toby sighs)

26:49.007 --> 26:51.108
Oh, gosh.
That's hundreds
of feet down.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.109
Happy:
Hey, project manager,

26:52.111 --> 26:56.780
I doubt I'll ever have use
for a crossbow again.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.248
I don't want to sound
like sylvester,

26:58.250 --> 26:59.883
But I'm terrified.

26:59.885 --> 27:02.052
Like you said, we can't go
through the front door.

27:02.054 --> 27:04.355
Won't exterior cameras see us?

27:04.357 --> 27:06.690
I calculated
a 12-degree-angle blind spot.

27:06.692 --> 27:09.059
So don't swing your legs
too much, skinny.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.128
I don't see a harness
in that duffel bag.

27:12.097 --> 27:13.764
Earbuds in.

27:17.035 --> 27:19.036
You're not terrified right now?

27:19.038 --> 27:21.138
I did the calculations.
No problem.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.673
Oh, gosh.

27:24.809 --> 27:27.244
Hey, when I grow up,
I want to be you. Good luck.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.779
Luck doesn't exist.

27:28.781 --> 27:30.314
Math and science does.

27:41.226 --> 27:44.361
Paige, just keep sylvester
in the loop.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.031
Sylvester, we're a go
on the roof.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.767
Copy that. Be careful.

27:52.070 --> 27:53.370
Toby:
Ah. Okay.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.288
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, that's...

28:11.290 --> 28:13.357
That's good.
That's really...
Good job.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.458
Come on.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.759
Let's go.
I'll go.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.394
Okay.

28:17.396 --> 28:18.395
I can help you.

28:19.998 --> 28:21.865
(toby yells)
you're all right.

28:21.867 --> 28:22.966
You're okay.
Don't look.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.068
Okay. Oh.

28:24.070 --> 28:25.302
I really don't
want to die

28:25.304 --> 28:26.737
In the middle of a dry spell.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.472
It was just one bad run
at roulette.

28:28.474 --> 28:29.740
You're gonna
be okay.

28:29.742 --> 28:30.941
I'm not talking about gambling.

28:30.943 --> 28:33.377
Ew.
Okay!

28:33.379 --> 28:34.978
I'm gonna go now.

28:36.381 --> 28:37.715
(panting)

28:37.717 --> 28:39.783
(paige whimpers, toby yells)

28:40.919 --> 28:42.853
(grunting)

28:44.489 --> 28:47.157
Toby! Don't
swing your legs.

28:47.159 --> 28:49.159
Oh... Oh, no.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.394
(groaning)

28:52.497 --> 28:54.465
Toby:
I got it.

28:54.467 --> 28:56.033
Oh, my liver.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.501
My bad.
I calibrated the line

28:57.503 --> 28:59.236
For my weight.
(groans)

28:59.238 --> 29:01.038
Come on.

29:06.344 --> 29:08.746
Ladies first.

29:11.516 --> 29:13.350
I've been baking
all my life.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.819
I... I never thought
I could make money at it.

29:15.821 --> 29:17.254
Well, follow
the distribution

29:17.256 --> 29:18.789
And marketing schedule
I gave you,

29:18.791 --> 29:20.457
And your scones
will be everywhere.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.025
What's a guy like you
doing in here?

29:22.027 --> 29:24.762
A casino was robbed.
I was framed. In a nutshell.

29:25.864 --> 29:27.464
I'm in real trouble, ronny.

29:27.466 --> 29:29.867
Vegas will do
that to you.

29:29.869 --> 29:34.505
Sad thing-- this is the second
time my hands cost me a job.

29:34.507 --> 29:36.540
I came out here
to be a magician.

29:36.542 --> 29:39.276
But all the great masters
all had long fingers

29:39.278 --> 29:41.211
So they could manipulate
the cards better.

29:41.213 --> 29:43.013
I could never get
to the next level.

29:43.982 --> 29:45.516
I loved magic.

29:45.518 --> 29:49.219
There's this one
guy, great scott.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.188
He used to play
the crimson

29:51.190 --> 29:54.091
Back when it was the,
uh, oasis queen.

29:54.093 --> 29:55.993
He used to disappear
from the stage

29:55.995 --> 29:57.528
And reappear on
las vegas boulevard.

29:57.530 --> 30:00.230
Blew my mind.

30:02.567 --> 30:04.234
That's it.

30:04.236 --> 30:05.836
That's it.

30:05.838 --> 30:08.872
When great scott did his show,

30:08.874 --> 30:11.008
Where was his stage?

30:11.010 --> 30:13.577
Well, the crimson
was remodeled 30 years ago.

30:13.579 --> 30:15.245
That's before connelly
bought it.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.947
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
that the stage

30:16.949 --> 30:19.316
Was in the northwest corner
of the casino.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.084
They got a big
storage room there now.

30:21.086 --> 30:22.386
Ooh, that's how they got out.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.922
I need to get this
information to my team.

30:24.924 --> 30:28.859
Sorry to tell you,
but you're locked up.

30:28.861 --> 30:29.960
Not for long.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.161
That rayon shirt,
it's highly flammable.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.496
Uh, can you tear off
the sleeve?

30:32.498 --> 30:34.364
My aunt gave this to me.
Tear off the sleeve, please.

30:34.366 --> 30:35.899
You're not gonna get
in any trouble. Come on.

30:35.901 --> 30:38.302
(grunting)

30:38.304 --> 30:39.870
Come on. Come on.

30:39.872 --> 30:41.471
Come on, come on,
give me...

30:41.473 --> 30:43.040
(sighs)

30:43.042 --> 30:45.142
Okay...

30:47.212 --> 30:48.879
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

30:49.447 --> 30:51.582
What are you doing?

30:51.584 --> 30:53.917
It has chlorine in it.

30:55.086 --> 30:57.988
Your pants-- they got
a metal button on them?

30:57.990 --> 30:59.456
Yeah.
Yeah.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.626
I know we're in jail,
but I'm not taking my pants off.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.862
No, I need the metal button.
I need to rub metal on metal.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.163
Create friction.
Come on.

31:06.165 --> 31:08.298
(sighs) all right.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.367
Come on, come on,
come on.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.037
All right. Wait.

31:19.644 --> 31:21.211
Don't breathe in
the chlorine fumes.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.147
Ronny:
What are you doing?

31:24.149 --> 31:26.483
The fumes will warp the
pins in the tumbler.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.918
Just listen.

31:29.320 --> 31:33.390
(clinking)

31:33.392 --> 31:34.458
(lock clicks)

31:34.460 --> 31:37.928
Just say you were
sleeping the whole time.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.097
Hey. I owe you one, ronny.

31:41.366 --> 31:44.301
New theory about why
you insisted I go first,

31:44.303 --> 31:45.936
And it involves you
being a perv.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.204
Oh, would you, please?

31:47.206 --> 31:48.472
I'm a doctor.

31:48.474 --> 31:51.275
All gluteus maximi
look the same to me.

31:51.277 --> 31:53.410
I mean, that said,
I've had worse views.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.411
(creaking)

31:54.413 --> 31:57.981
(grunts, groans)

32:02.287 --> 32:04.187
My kidney.

32:04.189 --> 32:05.689
Sylvester (over earbud):
Hurry. Security is inside.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.958
They might be on to us.
Security's coming.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.227
Happy, go. I'll...

32:10.229 --> 32:11.695
I'll distract them.
Guard: Over here!

32:14.632 --> 32:15.699
He's over here.

32:32.317 --> 32:34.318
Sylvester, the jump drive's in.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.652
You can initiate the download.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.054
(typing)

32:37.056 --> 32:39.156
Checking the signal.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.991
And I'm in. I'm in.

32:40.993 --> 32:43.360
Okay. The computers
are talking to each other,

32:43.362 --> 32:45.662
And we are getting the files
from the casino.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.298
(knocking)

32:50.735 --> 32:52.135
You're parked in
a loading zone.

32:52.137 --> 32:53.737
Move it unless you
want to get towed.

32:53.739 --> 32:56.206
Oh. Oh, uh...

32:56.208 --> 32:57.541
Um, I don't drive.

32:57.543 --> 32:58.542
Right.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.477
Move the car now.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.548
Sylvester?

33:04.550 --> 33:06.249
The drive's showing that the
transfer has been interrupted.

33:06.251 --> 33:07.718
What's going on?

33:07.720 --> 33:09.619
A mean lady made me move my car!

33:09.621 --> 33:12.022
(horns honking, tires screech)

33:21.666 --> 33:23.233
(elevator bell dings)

33:25.636 --> 33:28.105
(grunting)

33:30.074 --> 33:32.109
Oh.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.378
Well, hi.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.412
(panting)

33:35.414 --> 33:37.614
How you guys doing?

33:42.053 --> 33:43.653
Talk to me, sylvester.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.622
I'm almost back
in front of the hotel!

33:45.624 --> 33:49.092
It's the pedal
on the right, grandma.

33:49.094 --> 33:50.560
(horns honking)

33:50.562 --> 33:51.661
I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Okay.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.730
Whoa. Sylvester?

33:53.732 --> 33:56.166
Sylvester, you're driving?
Yeah, I have to

33:56.168 --> 33:57.768
Get to the hotel
for the wireless signal.

33:57.770 --> 34:01.304
Come on. No, seat
belt, seat belt.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.374
All right, all right.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.511
Happy:
Okay, it went through.

34:07.513 --> 34:09.579
Good job.

34:09.581 --> 34:11.681
Walter:
Thanks, happy.

34:11.683 --> 34:13.316
Walter?

34:13.318 --> 34:15.552
What the hell are you doing
out of jail?

34:15.554 --> 34:17.287
What are you doing
in the crimson?

34:17.289 --> 34:18.722
I'm trying to clear your name.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.291
Except now that toby's gone,
looks like I'm gonna be

34:21.293 --> 34:24.361
In jail soon enough, 'cause
I've got no one to pull me out.

34:24.363 --> 34:26.730
Okay, I can hear voices
outside the door.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.498
I'm cooked.

34:33.538 --> 34:34.771
You almost took a bullet for me;

34:34.773 --> 34:36.640
Figured I could take
a zip-line for you.

34:36.642 --> 34:38.809
Let's go.

34:42.447 --> 34:43.780
Oh...
(men shouting)

34:43.782 --> 34:45.115
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Okay, okay.

34:45.117 --> 34:46.383
All right, all right, all right.

34:46.385 --> 34:48.118
Easy!

34:48.120 --> 34:49.286
(groans)

34:49.288 --> 34:50.387
(tires screech)

34:50.389 --> 34:53.223
Come on, come on, come on!
Guys, come on!

34:53.225 --> 34:54.858
Quick, quick, get in!
Get in, get in, get in.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.159
Okay, let's go.
Go, go, go!

34:56.161 --> 34:59.229
Walter, how did you get out?

34:59.231 --> 35:01.631
Ronny. You were right,
he wasn't such a bad guy.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.600
Call toby,
we can go pick him up.

35:05.570 --> 35:06.837
No.

35:06.839 --> 35:08.839
For all we know,
he's hiding in a broom closet.

35:08.841 --> 35:11.208
His phone rings, we can
give away his location.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.542
Toby's a street rat;

35:12.544 --> 35:14.177
He'll track us down.

35:14.179 --> 35:15.745
He'll be okay.

35:20.218 --> 35:22.319
What's he doing here?

35:22.321 --> 35:23.854
Yeah, caught him sneaking
through the ventilation shaft.

35:23.856 --> 35:25.188
I'm just trying
to help my friend.

35:25.190 --> 35:26.389
Yeah, tell that to the cops.

35:26.391 --> 35:27.757
No, no, no, no, no, no.

35:27.759 --> 35:29.860
I've had enough bad p.R.
With the armed robbery today.

35:29.862 --> 35:31.528
Last thing we need
is the press picking up

35:31.530 --> 35:32.863
Some guys crawling through
our vents.

35:32.865 --> 35:34.331
You're gonna let me go?

35:34.333 --> 35:36.600
I'm gonna have you dropped off
in the desert,

35:36.602 --> 35:38.201
And you can walk
back to l.A.

35:38.203 --> 35:39.402
That sounds good.

35:39.404 --> 35:41.171
I'm not really dressed for that,
but that...

35:41.173 --> 35:43.273
Okay. All right.

35:43.275 --> 35:46.543
All right, based on what I heard
in jail, the odds are

35:46.545 --> 35:49.880
There is an inside man who knew
about the secret tunnel.

35:49.882 --> 35:52.749
All of connelly's accounts
are financially stable.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.484
Even if he did
have to pay someone off,

35:54.486 --> 35:56.186
He would've been able
to get a bridge loan--

35:56.188 --> 35:57.521
Easier than faking a robbery.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.790
Sylvester, pull up
the blueprints for the casino.

36:00.792 --> 36:03.260
There's a service entrance
they would have used

36:03.262 --> 36:04.895
To exit that tunnel
to their getaway car.

36:04.897 --> 36:07.464
An employee key card's needed
to open that door.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.799
So the person that swiped
their card to prop open the door

36:09.801 --> 36:11.168
Before the robbery
is the inside man.

36:11.170 --> 36:12.836
We have all the casino's files.

36:12.838 --> 36:16.173
I-I can just pull up
a log of all the swipes.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.845
Toby:
<i>When this is,</i>

36:21.847 --> 36:24.748
Uh, all over, and the real
robbers are caught,

36:24.750 --> 36:26.816
You are gonna feel bad.

36:26.818 --> 36:28.818
Mm, mm, mm.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.854
That's not gonna happen.

36:30.856 --> 36:33.823
Don't be so sure;
guilt can be a powerful emotion.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.327
Hold on a minute,
what's not gonna happen?

36:37.329 --> 36:39.930
You're not gonna feel bad or the
real robbers won't be caught?

36:43.401 --> 36:45.635
You know, renee,
we're pretty far out right now.

36:45.637 --> 36:48.872
I think a seven-hour walk will
teach me my lesson just fine.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.378
So you're a genius?

36:55.380 --> 36:57.547
Right now,
I'm not feeling like one.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.557
Renee, I'm not
really understanding

37:07.559 --> 37:10.760
You don't know anything
about me, or why I did this.

37:10.762 --> 37:13.930
You started working for your dad
when you were 15;

37:13.932 --> 37:17.467
Woman trying to prove herself
in a misogynistic business.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.302
Grew up in that place
assuming that one day...

37:19.304 --> 37:21.504
Ah! Right there.

37:21.506 --> 37:23.840
It's a subliminal desire
to distance yourself.

37:23.842 --> 37:27.377
I hit a nerve right when I said
you "grew up in that place."

37:27.379 --> 37:28.378
Hmm.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.879
That's maybe because

37:29.881 --> 37:32.449
It's no longer the
place you knew?

37:32.451 --> 37:35.252
Because your dad...

37:35.254 --> 37:36.886
Is expanding, hmm?

37:36.888 --> 37:39.656
And he's not including
you in that expansion.

37:39.658 --> 37:44.461
I have dedicated my life
to his casino-- to him--

37:44.463 --> 37:46.930
And he's giving control
to the new venue to some...

37:46.932 --> 37:48.765
Some guy
on the board of directors?

37:48.767 --> 37:51.534
Wow, I was
right on the money there.

37:51.536 --> 37:54.971
My partners and I are gonna take
the $10 million that I deserve

37:54.973 --> 37:56.940
And build our own venue--

37:56.942 --> 37:59.276
Better shows,
better events--

37:59.278 --> 38:01.778
And we're gonna drive
the crimson into the ground.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.846
And you...

38:04.282 --> 38:06.283
...You're gonna send a text.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.488
(cell phone rings)

38:11.490 --> 38:13.757
It's a text from toby.

38:13.759 --> 38:15.492
"security just dropped me off
in the desert.

38:15.494 --> 38:19.663
"I need you to pick me up at 115
longitude, 35 degrees latitude--

38:19.665 --> 38:21.998
Directly under orion's belt."

38:40.418 --> 38:43.887
I told you,
you and casinos don't mix.

38:45.690 --> 38:47.023
Get out the car now!

38:53.864 --> 38:55.932
Time to do some digging.

39:09.447 --> 39:11.381
Hold on.
He's supposed to be locked up.

39:11.383 --> 39:12.982
There's something wrong.
There's something's wrong here!

39:17.688 --> 39:20.023
(siren whooping)

39:20.025 --> 39:21.725
(officers shouting)

39:21.727 --> 39:23.793
On your knees!
Down now!

39:23.795 --> 39:26.563
(siren whooping)

39:26.565 --> 39:27.731
On your knees!

39:27.733 --> 39:29.132
Get on your knees!

39:31.736 --> 39:33.803
Get on your knees!

39:37.708 --> 39:40.877
Told you guys you weren't ready
to go out on your own.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.713
How the hell did you know
I was in trouble?

39:43.715 --> 39:45.014
Walter called.

39:45.016 --> 39:46.483
Said you texted
about meeting

39:46.485 --> 39:47.984
Underneath orion's belt

39:47.986 --> 39:50.120
Because it isn't visible
this time of the year.

39:50.122 --> 39:52.689
Walter figured it out?

39:58.095 --> 40:00.096
All right, turns out
renee's been laundering money

40:00.098 --> 40:02.899
For the jotas for years
through the casino.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.602
She's the one that had access
to the security film.

40:05.604 --> 40:08.104
Remember when you wouldn't
apologize to walter?

40:09.840 --> 40:12.509
I'm sorry.

40:15.413 --> 40:19.182
For the record, you
were a great walter.

40:19.184 --> 40:22.419
So, uh, you're not gonna
say "I told you so"?

40:22.421 --> 40:24.954
Didn't say that, jailbird.

40:24.956 --> 40:28.057
To make a call
to get one of my friends out.

40:28.059 --> 40:30.059
A friend in jail?

40:30.061 --> 40:31.428
Long story.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.196
I'm gonna give him
a cut of my pay,

40:33.198 --> 40:34.697
For a business he's starting.

40:34.699 --> 40:36.599
Happy: Any thoughts on
how we're getting home?

40:36.601 --> 40:38.201
I'd prefer it if
we didn't fly.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.203
Fine. Get in.

40:40.205 --> 40:44.007
I am glad that my
criminal informant

40:44.009 --> 40:45.208
Managed to break
this case open.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.509
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:46.511 --> 40:47.977
Your informant?

40:47.979 --> 40:51.047
I was the sacrificial lamb
that made it possible

40:51.049 --> 40:52.749
For happy to get
connelly's computer,

40:52.751 --> 40:54.551
Not to mention save
everyone's life.

40:54.553 --> 40:55.885
(scoffs)
where are you going?

40:55.887 --> 41:00.023
Well, I'm not riding five hours
listening to you kids argue.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.558
We're in the middle
of the desert.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.893
There's a bus depot
four miles west.

41:03.895 --> 41:05.895
Suggest you start walking.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.231
We barely have any money.

41:08.233 --> 41:11.568
Then I suggest you take on
another private client.

41:15.239 --> 41:17.073
That's a joke, right?

41:17.075 --> 41:18.641
Really? Okay.

41:21.579 --> 41:23.580
A woman hires us

41:23.582 --> 41:25.615
'cause she wants to prove
something to her dad.

41:25.617 --> 41:28.051
We take the job 'cause you want
to prove something to cabe.

41:28.053 --> 41:29.486
And I almost blow the job

41:29.488 --> 41:31.588
'cause I want to prove
something to you.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.490
Prove what?

41:35.526 --> 41:37.193
(sighs)

41:37.195 --> 41:38.895
You want to know
what the worst thing

41:38.897 --> 41:41.164
About what you said to me
in that jail was?

41:41.166 --> 41:42.866
Mm-hmm.
You were right.

41:42.868 --> 41:44.133
(chuckles):
Come on.
No.

41:44.135 --> 41:46.202
We're both too smart
to pretend otherwise.

41:47.671 --> 41:49.272
I've been a screwup
my entire life.

41:49.274 --> 41:51.975
Bookies and loan sharks-- you've
pulled my fat out of the fire

41:51.977 --> 41:53.176
More times than a fry cook.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.044
You have your weaknesses
and strengths,

41:55.046 --> 41:56.646
But you're an asset to the team.

41:56.648 --> 41:58.548
Yeah, I'm not talking about
being an employee.

41:58.550 --> 41:59.983
I'm talking about
being a friend.

41:59.985 --> 42:01.217
All I ever wanted to do

42:01.219 --> 42:02.852
Was show you
I was worth your effort,

42:02.854 --> 42:05.154
That I could...
That I could be counted on

42:05.156 --> 42:07.557
The way I count on you,
and I can't do that.

42:07.559 --> 42:09.993
You zip-lined down a hundred-
foot drop to help me tonight.

42:09.995 --> 42:11.995
That's a better friend
than most people ever have.

42:11.997 --> 42:13.830
You know what?

42:13.832 --> 42:16.266
You were right.

42:16.268 --> 42:19.068
When cabe found me, I was a kid.

42:19.070 --> 42:23.039
He'd send me computers,
codes to decrypt.

42:23.041 --> 42:25.174
I never really connected
with my dad.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.710
And cabe filled a void.

42:27.712 --> 42:30.313
So when he said
I couldn't do something,

42:30.315 --> 42:32.882
It bothered me.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.251
More than I realized.

42:35.253 --> 42:39.289
Well, I think we're out of time
for this session.

42:42.326 --> 42:45.194
I have an idea.
How much money have you got?

42:45.196 --> 42:47.263
12 bucks. Why?

42:49.233 --> 42:51.067
You give me an hour
at the tables,

42:51.069 --> 42:52.335
I'll have first-class airfare.

42:52.337 --> 42:54.671
Let's do it.

42:54.673 --> 42:58.608
I met some showgirls
in an elevator tonight.

42:58.610 --> 42:59.809
Focus.

42:59.811 --> 43:01.311
I'm just saying.

43:01.313 --> 43:03.279
