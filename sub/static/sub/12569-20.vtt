16:08.762 --> 16:09.803
to come to the dance.

16:09.845 --> 16:11.763
Really? Huh! That's weird,

16:11.805 --> 16:12.911
because with people

16:12.912 --> 16:14.015
dancing, and music playing,

16:14.057 --> 16:15.777
- it really seems like
- we're at the dance!

16:15.809 --> 16:17.811
Jessie, listen!

16:17.853 --> 16:19.479
- I snuck out
- to warn Luke!

16:19.521 --> 16:20.773
Rachel's old boyfriend,

16:20.774 --> 16:22.023
The Gorilla, is coming

16:19.521 --> 16:22.023
after him!

16:22.065 --> 16:23.796
Please tell me they call

16:23.797 --> 16:25.527
him The Gorilla because

16:22.065 --> 16:25.527
he likes to climb trees.

16:25.569 --> 16:27.571
No, it's because he's huge,

16:27.572 --> 16:29.573
grunts, and can peel

16:25.569 --> 16:29.573
a banana with his feet!

16:30.990 --> 16:32.263
And now he's going to give

16:32.264 --> 16:33.535
Luke the wedgie of his life!

16:33.577 --> 16:34.912
Oh, no. And Luke's

16:34.913 --> 16:36.246
probably wearing his

16:33.577 --> 16:36.246
Superman underwear!

16:36.287 --> 16:38.039
We've got to find him.

16:43.879 --> 16:45.547
Hey, Luke,

16:45.589 --> 16:47.008
get ready for some

16:47.009 --> 16:48.425
Gale-force winds.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.218
See what I did there?

16:51.720 --> 16:52.721
Have you grown

16:52.722 --> 16:53.722
since gym class?

16:53.764 --> 16:55.432
Yep. (ROARS)

16:56.558 --> 16:57.809
Ah!

16:57.851 --> 16:59.603
(EVERYONE GASPS)

17:00.979 --> 17:02.230
My punch!

17:02.272 --> 17:04.108
I knew I should

17:04.108 --> 17:05.943
have made brownies.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.403
Gale, all you've managed

17:07.404 --> 17:08.819
to do is make yourself

17:05.983 --> 17:08.819
look foolish,

17:08.862 --> 17:09.863
and ruin poor

17:09.864 --> 17:10.864
Adam Sandler's punch.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.366
"Thunder's"! When is that

17:12.367 --> 17:13.825
gonna catch on?

17:15.743 --> 17:17.454
- Gale, I can't believe
- you did that!

17:17.494 --> 17:18.829
Yeah, humiliating me

17:18.830 --> 17:20.164
is not going to win

17:17.494 --> 17:20.164
Rachel back.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.332
Right, Rachel?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.792
You still care!

17:24.586 --> 17:27.005
Or maybe it will.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.486
I'm sorry, Luke.

17:28.487 --> 17:29.925
The rose was sweet,

17:29.967 --> 17:31.636
but you should give it

17:31.637 --> 17:33.303
to a girl who really

17:29.967 --> 17:33.303
deserves it.

17:35.639 --> 17:37.515
- Hey, you want to go
- get some Chinese later?

17:37.557 --> 17:38.788
I've been really craving

17:38.789 --> 17:40.018
some moo goo Gale pan.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.020
- Oh, I've missed
- your clever wordplay.

17:47.859 --> 17:49.820
- You should be
- ashamed of yourself!

17:49.861 --> 17:51.780
- You think I want to live
- a life of crime?

17:51.822 --> 17:52.823
I can't support myself

17:52.824 --> 17:53.824
on deli tips!

17:53.865 --> 17:54.950
And the delivery charge

17:54.951 --> 17:56.034
is not the tip, people!

17:58.996 --> 18:00.164
Well, here's a thought.

18:00.165 --> 18:01.331
Why don't you get a new job?

18:01.372 --> 18:03.124
I was a philosophy major!

18:03.166 --> 18:05.502
There's no jobs in philosophy!

18:05.543 --> 18:06.754
Congratulations, Dad,

18:06.755 --> 18:07.963
you were right!

18:10.173 --> 18:12.342
Okay...

18:12.383 --> 18:13.531
Oh, no, no, no, no.

18:13.532 --> 18:14.678
Not Gary the Gravy Boat!

18:14.719 --> 18:17.180
He's my best friend!

18:17.221 --> 18:18.578
I mean, my best

18:18.579 --> 18:19.933
dispenser of gravy.

- Did you taste your - Cooking again?

Oh, Bertram,

18:36.243 --> 18:37.492
who is your friend?

(MUFFLED YELLING)

18:40.037 --> 18:41.309
And why are

18:41.310 --> 18:42.580
you tied up?

18:42.622 --> 18:44.416
(SIGHS) Because that's

what burglars do!

18:46.250 --> 18:47.565
(GASPS)

18:47.566 --> 18:48.879
So you're the burglar?

18:48.920 --> 18:50.422
What evil sickness

18:50.423 --> 18:51.923
drives a man to steal?

18:51.965 --> 18:53.633
- What else am I
- supposed to do?

18:53.675 --> 18:55.010
My only skills are peddling

18:55.011 --> 18:56.344
a bike and discussing

18:53.675 --> 18:56.344
Kierkegaard!

18:57.345 --> 18:58.659
Now, please, call off

18:58.660 --> 18:59.973
your velociraptor.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.602
I told you

19:03.603 --> 19:05.478
Mrs. Kipling could be

19:01.725 --> 19:05.478
a fierce guard lizard!

19:05.520 --> 19:07.022
Sorry, Mrs. K.

19:07.064 --> 19:08.649
Who knew you can

19:08.650 --> 19:10.233
go all Jurassic Park

19:07.064 --> 19:10.233
on someone?

19:10.274 --> 19:11.860
(GRUMBLES SOFTLY)

19:11.902 --> 19:13.462
- Hello! We're still
- getting robbed here!

19:13.486 --> 19:14.613
Someone untie me

19:14.614 --> 19:15.739
and call the cops!

19:15.780 --> 19:17.615
- No! Don't call
- the cops!

19:17.657 --> 19:19.264
If you let me go,

19:19.265 --> 19:20.869
I can get you free hoagies

19:17.657 --> 19:20.869
for the next three years!

19:20.911 --> 19:22.203
Really?

19:22.245 --> 19:23.997
BOTH: We are calling the cops!

19:24.039 --> 19:25.498
Okay, okay, okay.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.666
(GRUMBLES SOFTLY)

19:30.003 --> 19:31.004
Luke, are you okay?

19:31.922 --> 19:34.215
Not really.

19:34.257 --> 19:35.717
But on the bright side,

19:35.718 --> 19:37.176
none of that punch got

19:34.257 --> 19:37.176
in my mouth, so...

19:39.137 --> 19:40.722
- How did you know
- Gale was after me?

19:40.764 --> 19:41.932
Emma told me.

19:42.891 --> 19:44.851
Luke, I'm so sorry,

19:44.893 --> 19:46.686
but if Rachel can't see

19:46.687 --> 19:48.479
how great a guy you are,

19:44.893 --> 19:48.479
then she's a big idiot.

19:48.521 --> 19:50.252
Meanwhile, I'm sitting

19:50.253 --> 19:51.983
here without a date,

19:48.521 --> 19:51.983
looking like a bigger idiot.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.172
- Well, I can't do anything
- about the punch,

19:57.196 --> 19:58.781
But you are done

19:58.782 --> 20:00.366
just sitting around.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.598
(SCOFFS) Jessie, you

20:01.599 --> 20:02.786
don't have to do this.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.245
Yes, I do!

20:05.747 --> 20:07.812
Luke, you are sweet

20:07.813 --> 20:09.876
and funny and cool.

20:12.629 --> 20:13.922
(CHUCKLES) And you've

20:13.923 --> 20:15.214
got the moves like Jagger.

friends checking us out.

all the way through

20:24.223 --> 20:26.267
middle school on this one.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.728
I can coast all

20:27.729 --> 20:29.146
the way to my G.E.D!

Really? Yeah, well,

20:30.523 --> 20:31.856
maybe.(CHUCKLES)

20:34.943 --> 20:36.861
- Hey, Jessie.
- Hmm.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.884
I was told to give

20:38.885 --> 20:40.865
this to a girl who

20:36.903 --> 20:40.865
really deserves it.

20:40.907 --> 20:41.950
I think that's you.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.577
Aw, Luke.

20:45.328 --> 20:46.871
I'll treasure this.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.003
I treasured that.

- cheering me up.

Eh, that's what

21:01.117 --> 21:02.137
nannies are for.

21:02.179 --> 21:03.618
But you know

21:03.619 --> 21:05.056
what would make

21:02.179 --> 21:05.056
me feel great?

21:05.098 --> 21:06.891
- If I got a kiss.
- Don't push your luck.

21:12.878 --> 21:14.482
that I still have

21:11.270 --> 21:14.482
punch in my pants,

21:14.524 --> 21:15.692
this was a

21:15.693 --> 21:16.860
pretty good night.

21:16.901 --> 21:17.966
Emma, thanks again

21:17.967 --> 21:19.029
for trying to warn

21:16.901 --> 21:19.029
me about Gale.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.404
You're welcome.

21:20.446 --> 21:21.990
Yeah, that was

21:21.991 --> 21:23.533
a really great

21:20.446 --> 21:23.533
big sister thing to do.

You are now

21:24.786 --> 21:25.994
officially un-grounded.

Good, because seeing you

21:28.018 --> 21:29.998
dancing Gangnam Style

21:26.036 --> 21:29.998
was punishment enough.

21:31.332 --> 21:32.584
Adam Sandler

21:32.585 --> 21:33.835
did put you to shame.

21:34.585 --> 21:35.837
So not true.

21:35.879 --> 21:36.943
His lasso technique

21:36.944 --> 21:38.006

it was nanny season.
