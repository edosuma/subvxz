00:14.805 --> 00:16.725
[inhales deeply]

00:16.805 --> 00:18.485
[sighs]

00:18.565 --> 00:20.845
-Morning, Chief Ken!
-Fuck's sake, Dale!

00:21.645 --> 00:23.245
Chief Steve called at 2 a.m.

00:23.325 --> 00:25.845
He wants me to install
a sprinkler system at the bar,

00:25.925 --> 00:28.805
so at closing time,
it can rain coconut milk!

00:28.885 --> 00:32.325
[laughs] I <i>love </i>it! I just hope
it's not one of his drunk ideas!

00:32.405 --> 00:34.565
Don't call Steve "Chief Steve".

00:34.645 --> 00:35.925
Why, Chief Ken?

00:36.005 --> 00:38.605
-I just think it's inappropriate.
-Morning, Dale.

00:38.685 --> 00:40.525
-Morning, love!
-Morning, love!

00:42.125 --> 00:44.445
-In your suit?
-Yes! No rest for the wicked.

00:44.525 --> 00:47.845
9 a.m. with Peter,
then a strategy meeting, then--

00:47.925 --> 00:49.685
But it's Saturday.

00:51.365 --> 00:54.285
Yes. Strategy Saturday.

00:55.645 --> 00:56.965
Strate-day.

00:57.045 --> 00:59.445
It's a new scheme of Jane's.
I told you, no?

00:59.525 --> 01:03.525
Saturday becomes Monday.
Monday - now that's Thursday.

01:03.605 --> 01:07.325
-So...
-Hm! Such a fiendishly clever idea.

01:07.965 --> 01:11.125
Monday, Thursday,
I'm not even sure I understand it!

01:11.205 --> 01:12.645
It's only for this week.

01:12.725 --> 01:14.205
I don't think it'll stick.

01:14.285 --> 01:17.245
Oh, well, that's a shame.
Everybody's out today.

01:17.325 --> 01:21.165
I thought we could, er...
get a bit of Ken and Lorna time.

01:21.885 --> 01:23.605
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:23.685 --> 01:25.725
Ah! Well, obviously, I can't.

01:25.805 --> 01:28.525
Because I've got work, so...

01:38.925 --> 01:40.125
Bollocks!

01:50.565 --> 01:53.365
Least I can do when you've been
toiling away all day.

01:53.445 --> 01:54.565
Yeah, I have.

01:55.205 --> 01:58.325
Dale's really putting in the effort
with this new bar, isn't he?

01:58.405 --> 02:00.045
-Good on him.
-Yes.

02:00.125 --> 02:02.245
Although he should change the name
and the location,

02:02.325 --> 02:04.645
and probably think about
killing his business partner.

02:04.725 --> 02:06.245
-Apart from that...
-[laughing]

02:06.325 --> 02:10.085
Hey, these are a lot less expensive
than I thought.

02:10.925 --> 02:12.885
What would you think if I got a Vespa?

02:12.965 --> 02:16.845
I would think, and everybody would think,
you were having a mid-life crisis.

02:17.685 --> 02:21.125
Or that I was born to ride
through the streets of Lichfield

02:21.205 --> 02:24.085
like the hot-blooded
Mediterranean daredevil I am?

02:25.285 --> 02:27.485
[loud music]

02:27.565 --> 02:29.205
Who's that?

02:36.245 --> 02:38.765
It's 11.30, on a Saturday night!

02:38.845 --> 02:40.485
It's the new neighbours, isn't it?

02:40.565 --> 02:43.525
I think we can let it go
just this once, Ken. Night, love.

02:50.605 --> 02:52.405
[music booming]

03:02.165 --> 03:04.845
It's 12.45.
They're going to wake Sid up.

03:04.925 --> 03:08.285
-Sid sleeps through anything.
-Yes, but nobody told <i>them</i> that.

03:08.845 --> 03:10.565
I'm going to the garden centre tomorrow.

03:10.645 --> 03:13.005
If I'm tired,
it will affect my decision-making.

03:14.685 --> 03:16.685
-Where's my phone?
-No, Ken. Ken!

03:16.765 --> 03:18.525
No! Don't! Don't!

03:20.725 --> 03:22.285
[ringing]

03:23.205 --> 03:27.285
Police. Yes, hello.
I'd like to report a rowdy house party.

03:28.365 --> 03:29.685
2, Barker Road.

03:30.845 --> 03:32.485
How loud is it?

03:32.565 --> 03:35.205
Hang on a minute,
I'll just get my portable decibel meter.

03:35.285 --> 03:36.365
[he mouths]

03:36.925 --> 03:38.605
Oh, apparently, it's really loud!

03:39.445 --> 03:41.405
You <i>might</i> send someone over?

03:41.485 --> 03:43.165
Well, thank you so much.

03:46.485 --> 03:48.965
-I'm going round.
-Wait!

03:49.045 --> 03:51.805
I'm coming, too.
Their house is the same plan as ours.

03:51.885 --> 03:53.285
I want to see what they've done
with their kitchen.

03:53.365 --> 03:56.645
Lorna, we're going round to complain,
not to get design tips.

03:56.725 --> 03:59.965
I only want a peek. Give me 20 minutes
while I put something nice on.

04:00.045 --> 04:02.605
What? No! I'm going to throw
a dressing gown on and go around.

04:02.685 --> 04:05.405
You are not! Put that nice
Marks & Spencer's shirt on.

04:05.485 --> 04:08.365
Make a good impression
before you ruin their party.

04:08.445 --> 04:09.645
Oh, God!

04:10.645 --> 04:13.445
-[music booming out]
-[Ken] This shirt's really tight!

04:18.645 --> 04:22.165
Hey! I recognise you two!
You're from next door!

04:22.245 --> 04:24.765
-Yes!
-I saw you in the drive earlier.

04:24.844 --> 04:26.925
I hope we haven't been making
too much noise.

04:27.005 --> 04:31.885
-No! It's fine, no! No trouble at all!
-Well, come in! Have a drink! I insist.

04:31.965 --> 04:36.085
-I'm Lloyd. It's my birthday!
-Oh, happy birthday! I'm Lorna.

04:43.005 --> 04:46.125
45! Old man's birthday.

04:47.325 --> 04:49.125
Got myself a new Vespa, though.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.005
-Nice! Brand-new?
-I'll show you.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.725
Treated myself to the GTS 300.

04:55.805 --> 04:57.405
-[appreciative whistle]
-Because I'm worth it!

04:57.485 --> 04:58.525
Yeah, girl!

04:59.285 --> 05:02.805
Whoa! Look at this guy!
He's even older than you, Lloyd!

05:02.885 --> 05:05.605
I thought ages stopped at you!
[laughs]

05:06.165 --> 05:09.365
-Rude!
-This is my girlfriend, Maggie.

05:09.445 --> 05:12.605
These are mostly her friends,
much younger crowd, but fun, though.

05:12.685 --> 05:14.365
Right, drinks!

05:16.445 --> 05:18.885
[disco music playing]

05:21.285 --> 05:23.245
These people are so fun!

05:23.325 --> 05:26.125
I know! People I actually like!
This has never happened!

05:27.725 --> 05:29.045
[music stops]

05:29.125 --> 05:31.765
The strippers are here!

05:31.845 --> 05:33.485
-[partygoers] Wooo!
-[man] Calm down, please.

05:33.565 --> 05:35.125
Thank you. It's not strippers.

05:35.765 --> 05:38.605
We're having fun here, OK?
Don't be such a fascist!

05:38.685 --> 05:42.285
I'm not a fascist actually, ma'am. In
fact, in the last election, I voted Green.

05:42.365 --> 05:44.365
You're being very noisy.
Your neighbours have complained.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.565
Oh, hi, Ken! Do you remember me!
The, er...

05:47.645 --> 05:49.965
-No.
-Oh.

05:50.045 --> 05:52.765
Who complained? Which neighbour?
Come on, tell us!

05:52.845 --> 05:55.765
I'm a lawyer, and I don't think we should
question the officer about his sources.

05:55.845 --> 05:58.165
-Might get you in trouble.
-I don't take the calls.

05:58.245 --> 06:01.325
-I just respond to them.
-Fine! Fine! No more music.

06:01.405 --> 06:05.005
-Party's over, everyone!
-No way! This is our house.

06:05.085 --> 06:07.405
Come on, everybody, the party is not over!

06:07.485 --> 06:10.565
[all chanting] The party is not over!
The party is not over!

06:10.645 --> 06:12.325
The party is not over!

06:12.405 --> 06:14.085
The party is not over!

06:14.165 --> 06:16.405
Calm down, thank you, madam,
we're just...

06:16.485 --> 06:18.605
In my own house, I'll do what I want.

06:18.685 --> 06:21.925
-Maybe I want to rip my clothes off.
-Hey, no, Mags...

06:22.485 --> 06:24.605
Who's going to stop me
in my own bloody home?

06:24.685 --> 06:26.405
[cheering]

06:26.485 --> 06:29.405
-[man] She's in trouble.
-[woman] Oh, my God. Are they drugs?

06:30.165 --> 06:32.485
Erm, I think you'll have
to accompany me to the station.

06:33.045 --> 06:35.725
Please. Please, Officer,
you don't need to do this!

06:36.765 --> 06:39.765
-The party is over, everyone!
-[groaning]

06:39.845 --> 06:43.245
Ken, I'm so sorry.
It was really nice to meet you.

06:51.765 --> 06:55.405
Oh, and I love this new beach theme
for All Steve's Pals!

06:55.485 --> 06:59.085
I'm actually headed off to buy
four tonnes of genuine Hawaiian sand.

06:59.165 --> 07:01.565
Expensive, but you notice the difference.

07:02.125 --> 07:06.365
Hey, Chief Ken! Oh, and remember,
cocktail tasting later!

07:06.445 --> 07:09.245
-Looking forward to it, Dale!
-Yeah, let's get fucked out of our brains!

07:09.325 --> 07:12.405
-Dylan! But, yes.
-OK! Ha-ha, see ya!

07:14.085 --> 07:15.525
Lloyd still hasn't texted back.

07:15.605 --> 07:17.405
Well, you did get his girlfriend arrested.

07:17.485 --> 07:19.685
-What's this?
-Lloyd, next door.

07:19.765 --> 07:21.765
Your dad's developed an intense man-crush.

07:21.845 --> 07:24.605
-[laughs]
-I have not! Here, check this text.

07:25.765 --> 07:28.365
"Hey mate. Great party last night.
See you around."

07:28.925 --> 07:30.565
Do you think I overdid it,
came on too strong?

07:30.645 --> 07:32.125
I think you kept your cool.

07:32.205 --> 07:34.485
-Good.
-You're right, Mum, he's got it bad.

07:34.565 --> 07:38.165
-[both laugh]
-Shut up! I have not got a man-crush.

07:38.245 --> 07:41.205
Lloyd is just a really, really cool
and amazing guy who lives next door.

07:41.285 --> 07:43.565
-Whatevs.
-[Dylan] Careful, Mum!

07:43.645 --> 07:45.765
-Dad might run off and marry him!
-That would be modern.

07:45.845 --> 07:50.285
Right, I have a very important meeting
this morning. I'm a bit pushed for time.

07:51.445 --> 07:52.565
Arseholes.

07:52.645 --> 07:54.525
-Bye, big boy!
-[laughter]

08:04.565 --> 08:07.045
[sports commentary through headphones]

08:11.165 --> 08:15.445
[sultry R&B playing]

08:26.485 --> 08:28.445
-Ken!
-Lloyd!

08:28.525 --> 08:30.085
Shouldn't you be at work?

08:30.165 --> 08:32.245
Oh, yeah,
I was going to go in but, erm...

08:32.325 --> 08:34.245
How was your head
Sunday morning, champ?

08:34.325 --> 08:36.925
Wow! That hangover?

08:37.005 --> 08:39.684
I was like... Ooooh!

08:40.564 --> 08:41.885
Did you get my text?

08:41.965 --> 08:44.405
I think one of Maggie's young party
friends made off with my smartphone.

08:44.485 --> 08:47.164
-Oh.
-To be honest, I feel free without it!

08:47.245 --> 08:49.005
I know what you mean, bruv.

08:49.085 --> 08:52.605
Modern technology is so annoying,
isn't it? Call waiting!

08:52.685 --> 08:54.605
When stuff's slow to load!

08:56.405 --> 08:58.445
Yeah. I'm taking the new Vespa
into Birmingham.

08:58.525 --> 09:01.005
-Needs some fine tuning. Can't stop.
-Don't stop.

09:01.085 --> 09:03.005
I don't want you to stop.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.645
Unless, of course, crazy thought!

09:05.725 --> 09:08.645
We could scoot back and pick up
the old bike, and you could come with!

09:09.365 --> 09:10.845
Come with?

09:10.925 --> 09:12.805
Yeah, of course!

09:12.885 --> 09:14.405
I love coming with.

09:14.485 --> 09:16.085
What am I asking?
You can't take the day off.

09:16.165 --> 09:19.085
I can, I can, I can! I would love to!

09:19.165 --> 09:20.725
Well, grab your stuff.

09:31.045 --> 09:32.165
Chief Ken!

09:32.245 --> 09:35.245
-Dale.
-Just checking out the competition.

09:35.325 --> 09:38.925
All Steve's Pals are planning on
serving a 24-hour breakfast.

09:39.005 --> 09:41.525
And, well, this place has mastered
perpetual breakfasts.

09:41.605 --> 09:44.845
-Yeah.
-Wait, why aren't you at work?

09:45.885 --> 09:47.165
Oh, I was, um...

09:48.445 --> 09:51.925
I was feeling a bit woozy this morning,
so I went to the doctor,

09:52.005 --> 09:55.325
and his advice was I should have a full
English breakfast immediately, you know.

09:55.405 --> 09:58.205
-So, here I am.
-Huh.

09:59.685 --> 10:01.805
Hm. Yeah!
Well, that makes complete sense!

10:01.885 --> 10:04.165
OK! I'm going to have to...

10:06.045 --> 10:07.525
-Bye.
-Bye.

10:14.285 --> 10:17.725
[up-beat feel-good music]

10:19.405 --> 10:21.285
-Woo-hoo!
-All right! Yeah!

10:28.285 --> 10:29.405
Woo!

10:31.125 --> 10:33.245
Wa-hay!

10:38.205 --> 10:40.085
[roars]

10:45.725 --> 10:47.325
Woo-hoo!

10:51.325 --> 10:52.965
-Lloyd, I love you!
-What?

10:53.045 --> 10:54.005
Nothing!

10:55.685 --> 10:58.645
[electric guitar rock riff]

10:58.725 --> 11:01.645
[Ken copies]

11:01.725 --> 11:04.125
[new riff]

11:05.285 --> 11:08.285
[copies]

11:09.645 --> 11:12.165
[fast, extravagant riff]

11:18.525 --> 11:21.805
-Yes, Lloyd! You rock!
-[laughing]

11:23.005 --> 11:26.405
-How's, um, how's Maggie?
-Oh, she got off with a caution.

11:27.725 --> 11:29.605
Tell you what gets me, though, Ken -

11:29.685 --> 11:32.605
that neighbour calling the police
over one tiny birthday party.

11:33.285 --> 11:36.365
Yeah, although,
I mean, it was after midnight.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.245
And in a residential area, but...

11:38.325 --> 11:40.925
Yeah, but you go round,
explain the problem like a man,

11:41.005 --> 11:43.325
not crawl to the police like some worm.

11:43.885 --> 11:44.885
Yeah.

11:44.965 --> 11:48.325
Still, we've no way of knowing
who it was, so...

11:48.405 --> 11:49.805
Ken.

11:51.805 --> 11:53.485
I know exactly who it was.

11:55.525 --> 11:56.645
Do you?

12:01.445 --> 12:02.885
Steve Chance.

12:02.965 --> 12:04.805
-[sighs]
-From over the road. You know him?

12:06.045 --> 12:08.325
Not really. I mean, I've met him.

12:08.405 --> 12:09.565
Day we moved in,

12:09.645 --> 12:12.485
I caught him looking in
our bathroom window with binoculars.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.245
He said he was looking for owls.

12:15.445 --> 12:18.565
It was noon. Weird guy.

12:18.645 --> 12:21.045
Yeah. Still...

12:21.125 --> 12:24.125
-You can't be sure it was him, so...
-Can't I?

12:24.205 --> 12:27.245
Ken, if there's one thing you learn
from leaving your wife and kids,

12:27.325 --> 12:29.565
quitting your job
and living off your savings,

12:29.645 --> 12:31.845
it's trust your instincts.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.045
Steve Chance is the grass,

12:34.125 --> 12:36.765
and grasses get grassed on.

12:38.565 --> 12:40.165
Know what I mean?

12:42.525 --> 12:43.805
Not really.

12:47.005 --> 12:48.605
Hey, you want a beer?

12:48.685 --> 12:51.325
Now, I would love a beer!

12:51.405 --> 12:53.645
-[doorbell]
-Get that for us, would you, mate?

12:53.725 --> 12:55.005
Yeah.

12:58.325 --> 13:01.685
Chief Ken!
What are you doing at Lloyd's house?

13:01.765 --> 13:04.565
Oh, it's... Did I not tell you?
I'm, um...

13:05.725 --> 13:08.605
It's a team-building exercise at work.

13:09.885 --> 13:13.765
You just go round to a neighbour's house
and you compose some guitar music.

13:14.685 --> 13:18.325
Then, at the end of the week,
there's a competition.

13:19.445 --> 13:21.885
-What do you win?
-Just some, um...

13:22.885 --> 13:24.005
law stuff.

13:28.725 --> 13:33.245
Gotcha! Got to say, Jane really is
shaking up things at your work.

13:33.325 --> 13:35.205
-[both laughing]
-She is!

13:35.285 --> 13:37.365
I was just going door-to-door
doing some market research

13:37.445 --> 13:38.925
-for All Steve's Pals.
-OK.

13:39.005 --> 13:42.405
I won't interrupt you guys!
Let the music flow, maestro!

13:42.485 --> 13:44.685
Oh, I will, I can promise you that!

13:44.765 --> 13:45.805
Woo!

13:47.205 --> 13:48.685
-Bye!
-Bye!

13:56.285 --> 13:59.285
Ah! Beering it up with a mate
at 4pm on a weekday.

13:59.365 --> 14:01.885
I have not done this for time, bruv.

14:01.965 --> 14:04.565
While every other sucker's
chained to their desk!

14:04.645 --> 14:06.885
-Oh!
-Yeah, suckers!

14:07.965 --> 14:11.005
Ahhhh, beer. I love it!

14:11.085 --> 14:13.685
You know, I like you, Ken.

14:15.085 --> 14:16.605
I like you too, mate.

14:17.725 --> 14:20.405
-What you up to there?
-Just putting this baby up on Instagram.

14:20.485 --> 14:21.645
Don't do that!

14:23.045 --> 14:25.205
Sorry, listen.

14:26.485 --> 14:30.445
It's a little bit sensitive, but I didn't
have to get the day off from work today.

14:31.085 --> 14:35.005
You see, a couple of weeks back,
I was suspended.

14:35.085 --> 14:36.085
Ken!

14:36.165 --> 14:40.605
Only for a month. I haven't told Lorna.
I didn't want to worry her, you know?

14:40.685 --> 14:43.205
Totally! Get yourself some Ken time.

14:43.285 --> 14:45.005
Yeah. Yeah!

14:45.965 --> 14:49.965
It's a relief to tell someone, to be
honest. It's been a nightmare at home.

14:50.045 --> 14:53.405
Imagine having to keep it from your whole
family you've been suspended from work.

14:53.485 --> 14:55.965
-Chief Ken?
-What the fuck, Dale?

14:56.045 --> 14:58.245
Jiminy Cricket!
You've been suspended from work?

15:03.005 --> 15:05.485
[Ken] You're not to let on about
any of this. Do you understand?

15:05.565 --> 15:07.565
[Dale] Yes. Your secret is safe with me.

15:07.645 --> 15:09.645
Though I can't promise
not to tell Rachel and Lorna.

15:09.725 --> 15:12.765
What? Those are the exact people
you're not allowed to tell!

15:12.845 --> 15:15.805
-You're going to have to lie, Dale.
-No, Chief Ken.

15:15.885 --> 15:18.765
Lying is like my third-worst thing,
after remembering and Scrabble.

15:18.845 --> 15:21.445
As soon as I lie,
I can feel people looking at me,

15:21.525 --> 15:23.885
and I just know they can see
the evil in my face.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.405
I guess I could just never look
at anybody ever again.

15:26.485 --> 15:28.325
Well, you're going to have
to find a solution.

15:28.405 --> 15:31.685
Because if you tell Lorna,
I won't be your friend any more.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.685
-I would hate that.
-Well, it's an option.

15:33.765 --> 15:35.805
I've got a new friend now,
so you're expendable.

15:37.045 --> 15:39.245
I am watching you.

15:55.605 --> 16:00.365
-Oh, hiya, love!
-Lorna! My beautiful wife!

16:01.205 --> 16:02.645
What a tiring day at work.

16:02.725 --> 16:04.805
-I'll cook dinner later, though.
-No need.

16:05.485 --> 16:08.165
It's Dale's cocktails
over at All Steve's Pals.

16:09.045 --> 16:11.245
-What's he doing with you?
-Oh!

16:11.325 --> 16:13.725
I bumped into him
on my way back from work.

16:14.525 --> 16:17.165
I was walking along the road,
and there he was.

16:17.245 --> 16:19.645
Oh, right.
What were you up to, Dale?

16:19.725 --> 16:20.725
Mm...

16:21.845 --> 16:23.365
Hmm?

16:24.685 --> 16:26.485
He was gathering stones.

16:27.485 --> 16:30.125
Oh. Did you get any nice ones?

16:30.205 --> 16:31.925
Uh...

16:32.005 --> 16:34.245
I made him throw them away.

16:34.325 --> 16:36.365
-Yeah.
-Dale?

16:37.525 --> 16:38.565
Yes.

16:38.645 --> 16:41.885
-Stones. I lost my lovely stones.
-Lovely stones.

16:41.965 --> 16:44.285
-Oh, OK, I'm going to go for a jog!
-Yeah.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.805
He seems under the weather,
doesn't he?

16:47.885 --> 16:50.245
It's not worth analysing.
It's probably meaningless.

16:54.565 --> 16:57.685
When she looks me in the eyes,
I just want to tell her everything!

16:57.765 --> 17:00.165
Find a way!

17:13.565 --> 17:15.565
Et voilà!

17:16.285 --> 17:20.285
Bespoke cocktails.
The Lorna, short and sweet.

17:20.364 --> 17:24.285
-Aw.
-The Rachel, fruity, with a spicy kick.

17:24.364 --> 17:27.124
-[Rachel chuckles]
-And the Ken.

17:27.205 --> 17:29.485
It's plain, no-nonsense,
with a high fat content.

17:29.565 --> 17:32.005
-Yes, thank you, Dale.
-Mmmm!

17:32.084 --> 17:33.765
I really like mine, Dale!

17:35.245 --> 17:37.325
Now, probably explain
the weird mask.

17:37.885 --> 17:41.005
This? Oh, it's just something I threw on!

17:41.085 --> 17:43.285
From here on out,
I'll constantly wear it.

17:43.365 --> 17:45.725
Quite right, too.
It's a nice mask. Suits him.

17:45.805 --> 17:48.165
Yeah, a totally normal boyfriend.
Well done, Rach!

17:50.245 --> 17:51.125
[door closes]

17:51.205 --> 17:52.765
Give me a double Ken.

17:52.845 --> 17:57.365
-Just got back from mine. I am in shock.
-[Lorna] Are you OK, Steve?

17:57.445 --> 17:58.925
An abomination, Lorna!

17:59.005 --> 18:02.005
I, Steve Chance, have on this day
in the year of our Lord 2018,

18:02.085 --> 18:03.885
been cressed!

18:03.965 --> 18:06.165
Cressed? What do you mean "cressed"?

18:06.245 --> 18:09.685
Some lowlife put cress seeds through
my letterbox. They've grown there.

18:09.765 --> 18:11.165
Grass all over the doormat.

18:11.245 --> 18:14.685
Connie and I used to make love
on that mat. It was uncomfortable for her,

18:14.765 --> 18:17.285
-but it protected the carpet.
-Oh, Steve.

18:18.005 --> 18:21.005
Only one kind of seed
should be on that carpet, Lorna.

18:21.085 --> 18:23.165
-I refer, of course, to mine.
-Yes, thank you, Steve.

18:23.245 --> 18:25.285
-I'm sure we're all very upset for you.
-[clatter]

18:26.965 --> 18:29.605
Um, cheers! A Lorna, Steve?

18:30.365 --> 18:31.925
-Don't mind if I do.
-Cheers.

18:33.965 --> 18:37.765
Ken and Lorna mingling in my tummy.

18:37.845 --> 18:40.925
-Ah, fucking hell.
-Ugh!

18:41.485 --> 18:44.285
This Civil War history walk
goes all the way to Worcester.

18:44.365 --> 18:46.725
We could get the girls,
make a weekend of it!

18:46.805 --> 18:49.445
Yes! Now, that is a great idea!

18:52.605 --> 18:56.045
Hey, Lloyd,
I hope you don't mind me asking.

18:56.125 --> 18:59.085
It seems that Steve Chance
has been cressed.

18:59.885 --> 19:01.765
I couldn't help but draw a connection,

19:01.845 --> 19:05.645
you know, what with what you said about
the grasses getting grassed and all that.

19:05.725 --> 19:06.725
Yeah?

19:08.805 --> 19:10.365
[laughing]

19:10.445 --> 19:12.365
Bet that got to him, right?

19:12.445 --> 19:14.885
-It seems so, yes.
-And it doesn't stop there.

19:14.965 --> 19:17.245
I've got loads of ideas.
Poison his garden.

19:17.325 --> 19:20.005
Maybe throw a burning newspaper
through his window.

19:20.965 --> 19:23.285
All good ideas.

19:23.365 --> 19:25.605
Or maybe just leave it.

19:25.685 --> 19:28.605
I mean, you can't be sure it was Steve
that made the phone call.

19:29.565 --> 19:32.965
-Well, who did, then?
-Oh, it was probably Steve.

19:33.725 --> 19:37.885
But, what it is is...
now you've pranked him back,

19:37.965 --> 19:39.445
probably just call it quits.

19:40.765 --> 19:42.445
Ken...

19:44.245 --> 19:46.845
If a man wrongs me, I crush him.

19:48.325 --> 19:51.405
I can't stand sneaks
and I can't stand liars.

19:51.485 --> 19:53.125
It's got me into trouble before.

19:56.405 --> 19:58.765
-Pork scratchings?
-Yes, lovely.

20:03.005 --> 20:05.245
[Lloyd] No, you're right,
I'm too impetuous.

20:05.325 --> 20:07.965
For your sake, Ken,
I will not hurt Steve Chance.

20:08.045 --> 20:10.285
Oh, phew! That is a relief.

20:10.365 --> 20:11.765
I was worried, actually.

20:11.845 --> 20:14.805
I'm just sensitive
when it comes to Maggie.

20:14.885 --> 20:17.325
Before she came along,
I was on the edge, Ken.

20:17.405 --> 20:19.805
I'd left my wife.
I didn't know where I was.

20:20.645 --> 20:21.925
Even thought of ending it.

20:22.725 --> 20:24.165
She's my rock.

20:24.245 --> 20:25.805
My reason.

20:25.885 --> 20:27.125
Yeah.

20:27.205 --> 20:29.085
[Maggie] You can't do this!
You can't take me away!

20:29.165 --> 20:31.645
-What the hell's going on?
-Get off me!

20:31.725 --> 20:33.845
Lloyd Evans? Your girlfriend's
been in the country illegally.

20:33.925 --> 20:36.565
She came up last week on the system
with the drugs charge.

20:36.645 --> 20:39.245
-Thought she'd left months ago.
-No! You touched my tit!

20:39.325 --> 20:41.005
That's sexual harassment!

20:41.085 --> 20:43.005
Look, Officer, I'm a lawyer,
I think maybe--

20:43.085 --> 20:47.005
Look, honestly and sympathetically,
I take no joy in this.

20:47.085 --> 20:50.925
Right, let's load her up
and get this rodeo rolling!

20:51.005 --> 20:53.365
-Please don't do this.
-No choice, I'm afraid.

20:53.445 --> 20:57.325
-I'm stuck in here with a lesbian! Help!
-It's ironic, isn't it?

20:57.405 --> 21:00.085
None of this would have happened if your
neighbour hadn't made that complaint.

21:00.165 --> 21:02.845
[chuckles] Right, let's go!

21:02.925 --> 21:05.965
-Baby!
-Maggie! Maggie!

21:06.045 --> 21:08.885
Maggie, don't go! Maggie, I love you!

21:08.965 --> 21:10.925
Don't leave me!

21:18.845 --> 21:21.645
I miss my baby! I miss my baby!

21:21.725 --> 21:24.365
I know. I know you do, love.

21:24.445 --> 21:26.045
Here you go.

21:27.005 --> 21:29.245
[sobbing] Maggie!

21:29.325 --> 21:32.405
Right, well, thank you.
Yeah, you've been amazingly helpful.

21:32.485 --> 21:33.565
Great. Thanks.

21:34.365 --> 21:37.965
Well, that was Immigration.
She's totally fucked.

21:38.045 --> 21:39.805
He's not taking it well.

21:39.885 --> 21:42.525
[sobbing gently]

21:42.605 --> 21:44.445
Funny, isn't it?

21:44.525 --> 21:47.845
I mean, you basically
got his girlfriend deported.

21:47.925 --> 21:51.925
Lorna, because you cause something, it
doesn't necessarily mean it's your fault.

21:52.005 --> 21:54.125
Isn't that exactly what it means?

21:54.205 --> 21:58.085
Look, she's a bit vapid anyway,
isn't she, Maggie?

21:58.165 --> 22:01.645
And too young for him. I actually think
this could be good for Lloyd.

22:01.725 --> 22:05.205
These lies have a way
of spiralling out of control.

22:05.285 --> 22:08.885
Lorna, I promise you, everything's
going to be absolutely fine.

22:08.965 --> 22:10.125
[crash]

22:10.205 --> 22:12.045
[spaghetti western theme]

22:13.365 --> 22:15.125
Ken! Scotch!

22:15.205 --> 22:17.365
You'll join me in a dram?

22:17.445 --> 22:20.965
-No, no, you're all right, thanks, mate.
-Mind if I use this, then?

22:21.045 --> 22:22.285
Whoa.

22:22.365 --> 22:23.925
-Hey, presto!
-[Lorna] Lloyd.

22:24.005 --> 22:27.885
Lloyd, everything's going to be fine.
Just calm down!

22:28.805 --> 22:30.205
You have to do something.

22:30.285 --> 22:33.125
Those oven gloves are Cath Kidston.
They are not to be used for murder.

22:36.965 --> 22:39.125
Ken, mate, I'm going to finish this glove,

22:39.205 --> 22:43.005
then me and you go over to Steve's
and give him a couple of fork punches.

22:43.085 --> 22:44.565
Tell him it wasn't Steve.

22:44.645 --> 22:47.005
Maybe at a later date,
when he's not got knives on his hands.

22:47.085 --> 22:48.845
[Rachel] Hello!

22:50.965 --> 22:54.325
What's going on?
Who's Edward Cutleryhands?

22:54.405 --> 22:57.045
Lloyd. He's just had a bit of bad news,

22:57.125 --> 23:00.005
so we all need to work on
keeping him relaxed.

23:00.805 --> 23:04.805
-There, there, fella.
-Hey, let's get you to bed, eh?

23:04.885 --> 23:07.725
-Things will seem brighter in the morning.
-That's true, she's right.

23:07.805 --> 23:11.085
-But we're drinking!
- But maybe we should stop drinking?

23:11.165 --> 23:13.605
I am drinking until I can drink no longer!

23:13.685 --> 23:17.725
-Oh. Actually, that might work, too.
-I'll check the drinks cabinet.

23:17.805 --> 23:22.925
-And then, I'm going to fuck Steve up.
-Great idea. Let's keep that on the table.

23:23.005 --> 23:25.125
But maybe we could play
a drinking game.

23:25.205 --> 23:29.285
Yeah? Where you drink more
and more and more

23:29.365 --> 23:33.485
until you have a lovely sleep and you
<i>don't</i> murder Steve, how would that be?

23:34.045 --> 23:37.445
He's probably not over there, anyway.
He's probably still out in his Uber.

23:37.525 --> 23:40.125
Actually, he just got home.
I saw him drive in.

23:41.125 --> 23:43.085
[Lloyd roars]

23:43.965 --> 23:47.285
-[door slams]
-Dale! What have you done?

23:51.845 --> 23:54.205
Steve Chance!

23:54.285 --> 23:56.845
Come on out here and face the music!

23:56.925 --> 24:02.725
If you're a man, come on out here
and fight me like a man!

24:02.805 --> 24:04.685
Oh, Jesus!

24:05.845 --> 24:10.005
Oh, Lloyd, Lloyd! Calm down!

24:10.645 --> 24:13.085
-Lloyd! It'll be all right.
-[shouting]

24:13.165 --> 24:16.885
Steve Chance took my Maggie!

24:19.205 --> 24:20.605
Where are you?

24:20.685 --> 24:23.885
A shit for a shit.

24:26.805 --> 24:28.365
Oh, fuck it, fuck it!

24:31.445 --> 24:33.365
[Lloyd] Oh, that's cold! [strains]

24:34.285 --> 24:35.845
Damn it, it's not coming.

24:36.485 --> 24:40.925
-Someone's shitting on my lawn!
-Here he is! The coward.

24:41.005 --> 24:44.285
-You destroyed my life!
-What are you talking about?

24:44.365 --> 24:48.325
No more games, Chance.
You grassed on me, and I grassed on you.

24:48.405 --> 24:52.285
But now the shit is about to get real.

24:52.805 --> 24:54.885
-[straining]
-Nobody shits on my lawn.

24:54.965 --> 24:57.925
If it's a fight you want, then,
by Odin, it's a fight you shall receive.

24:59.525 --> 25:01.165
-18th-century duelling pistol.
-Oh, no.

25:01.245 --> 25:04.085
They don't make them like this any more.
Don't think I won't use it.

25:07.925 --> 25:09.525
[Lorna] Jesus!

25:11.845 --> 25:13.005
Oh!

25:14.925 --> 25:17.085
[both roaring]

25:19.045 --> 25:20.125
[Ken] It's pathetic!

25:22.925 --> 25:25.205
-[Lorna] Bloody idiots!
-[Rachel] Bloody hell.

25:26.365 --> 25:28.645
-[Ken] That's it. Get him, Dale.
-[Rachel] Yes, Dale!

25:33.005 --> 25:35.925
That's it, Dale. Hold him still
while I blast away his gonads.

25:36.005 --> 25:37.565
Give me that, you idiot.

25:39.725 --> 25:42.605
Right. This stops here.

25:44.085 --> 25:47.525
Lloyd... it was me that made
the phone call to the police.

25:48.285 --> 25:49.685
You?

25:49.765 --> 25:54.125
Yeah. It wasn't Steve's fault
that Maggie got deported. It was mine.

25:54.205 --> 25:57.605
I didn't tell you because
I was enjoying hanging out too much.

25:57.685 --> 26:00.245
No, no, you're just saying this
to save Steve's neck.

26:00.325 --> 26:04.365
I'm not, honestly.
Dale, tell him the truth.

26:05.645 --> 26:09.045
-The real truth, Chief Ken?
-Yes, Dale. The truth.

26:09.125 --> 26:10.485
Go on, Dale.

26:11.525 --> 26:14.365
OK, um... everyone...

26:15.685 --> 26:17.525
Chief Ken's been suspended from work

26:17.605 --> 26:19.565
and he's been hiding it from Lorna
this whole time.

26:19.645 --> 26:21.845
Not <i>that</i> truth, for fuck's sake!

26:22.725 --> 26:24.845
What? Ken?

26:24.925 --> 26:27.205
He's also been spending
most of his days drinking.

26:27.285 --> 26:29.205
I'm sorry, Chief Ken,
she's staring me right in the eyes.

26:30.045 --> 26:33.365
You're suspended from work?
Why the hell don't I know about this?

26:33.445 --> 26:35.205
Oh, Dad! This is kind of a low.

26:35.285 --> 26:37.725
It was only for a month! So I just--

26:37.805 --> 26:39.405
Makes you question
the whole relationship, I bet.

26:39.485 --> 26:40.525
Shut up, Dale!

26:40.605 --> 26:44.925
-Lorna, I can explain.
-Explain to <i>me</i>. You destroyed my life!

26:45.005 --> 26:48.165
Oh, leave it out!
It was Maggie that had the drugs.

26:48.245 --> 26:50.965
And it was you who decided
to go all Mr Crazy Glove.

26:51.045 --> 26:52.565
I personally have done nothing
whatsoever to--

26:54.205 --> 26:56.685
-Oooh!
-My baby!

26:57.765 --> 27:01.285
No, no, no, no, no!
Call the engine! Call a fire engine!

27:01.365 --> 27:03.925
-Lorn.
-Ken, I can't even look at you.

27:04.005 --> 27:07.725
-Find somewhere else to spend the night.
-Bloody hell, Dad.

27:10.205 --> 27:12.805
Wow, Chief Ken. Homeless!

27:13.325 --> 27:17.765
I would offer you shelter, but I sort of
stay at your place, so, you know...

27:22.165 --> 27:24.565
It's OK, Ken, you've got me.

27:25.125 --> 27:26.725
You'll always have me.

27:28.485 --> 27:33.325
My baby! My baby!
Hold on! Hold on, Daddy's here!

27:36.085 --> 27:37.485
Oh!
