04:03.125 --> 04:04.577
Well...

04:04.777 --> 04:07.618
- we love the characters.
- But?

04:07.718 --> 04:10.111
- It's a terrific story.
- And?

04:10.211 --> 04:11.767
And the...

04:11.867 --> 04:15.502
- The dialogue is great.
- Paul.

04:19.675 --> 04:22.477
I just wanna make sure
you give them your best.

04:23.861 --> 04:24.959
Oh, my God.

04:25.059 --> 04:29.351
Look, don't get me wrong.
We do think it has a lot of potential.

04:29.651 --> 04:33.222
- Did you even read it?
- Of course I read it, Anna. Calm down.

04:33.322 --> 04:36.425
I am calm, but this is the third time
you're telling me to rewrite my draft.

04:36.525 --> 04:38.794
I mean, how am I even supposed
to meet the deadline, Paul?

04:40.050 --> 04:41.797
Just take a look at the notes.

04:41.897 --> 04:45.150
- I'm sure it's an easy fix for you.
- Yeah, that's what you said last time.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.352
Why not let the studio decide
if they like it or not?

04:47.452 --> 04:50.120
Because you only get one shot at this.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.125
Listen, Anna.

04:53.225 --> 04:55.160
This is me managing you.

04:55.260 --> 04:57.629
I'm not trying to piss you off,

04:57.729 --> 05:00.532
but it's not like one of your blogs
where people can look at photographs

05:00.632 --> 05:02.434
when they get bored of the writing.

05:02.534 --> 05:05.101
Well, that got your attention,
didn't it?

05:07.406 --> 05:09.675
I just don't want you to be one
of those writers who screws up

05:09.775 --> 05:14.311
before anybody's even read their script.
I've got you this chance, now use it.

05:25.057 --> 05:28.994
<i>I've been experiencing sleep paralysis</i>

05:29.094 --> 05:30.896
<i>since I was a little kid.</i>

05:30.996 --> 05:33.298
<i>Like my mind is awake.</i>

05:33.698 --> 05:38.585
<i>I can see and hear and feel,
but I can't move any part of my body.</i>

05:38.685 --> 05:40.703
<i>It's terrifying.</i>

06:55.513 --> 06:57.380
It's me.

07:08.059 --> 07:10.562
I don't like flowers.
You should know that.

07:10.762 --> 07:13.598
Yeah, well, it's the effort
that counts, doesn't it?

07:13.698 --> 07:15.500
Do you have any idea what time it is?

07:16.300 --> 07:18.768
It's never too late
for an apology, is it?

07:24.443 --> 07:26.778
I just wanted to say sorry
for this afternoon.

07:26.978 --> 07:29.612
I think I was a bit rough on you.

07:30.582 --> 07:34.116
I just don't want you to waste
your first opportunity, that's all.

07:36.354 --> 07:38.390
No, thanks.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.258
Really?

07:40.358 --> 07:42.260
It's not like you to turn down
a glass of wine.

07:42.460 --> 07:45.221
I just had an Ambien.

07:46.631 --> 07:48.267
Still popping the pills, then?

07:49.267 --> 07:51.670
- I thought you came for an apology.
- I did, but...

07:51.770 --> 07:55.271
Well, then stop talking
and come to bed before I fall asleep.

08:07.752 --> 08:09.488
Oh, I meant to tell you that I...

08:09.588 --> 08:12.324
I managed to buy you
a little bit of extra time.

08:13.024 --> 08:16.593
They agreed to...
postpone the deadline on the script.

08:27.205 --> 08:31.076
So I was thinking maybe we should
get out of the city for a few days.

08:31.321 --> 08:33.476
You know, just relax.

08:37.048 --> 08:38.847
Get some good sleep.

08:40.284 --> 08:41.886
Forget about the draft.

08:42.087 --> 08:44.853
You know,
take the heat off a little bit.

08:45.156 --> 08:47.240
It'll be inspiring.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.934
Remember I told you I have that
little hideaway out in Joshua Tree?

09:37.308 --> 09:39.711
So around me is utter devastation
with dead bodies

09:39.811 --> 09:41.947
floating down the street
and buildings collapsing.

09:42.047 --> 09:44.049
And I have nothing better to do
but to go downstairs

09:44.149 --> 09:46.117
and underwear shop with Prince

09:46.217 --> 09:50.219
at what has turned into a Black Friday
sales event at Wal-Mart.

09:52.969 --> 09:54.159
Yeah.

09:54.459 --> 09:56.561
Yeah, I started writing down
my dreams again.

09:56.661 --> 09:59.362
A better dream memory is supposed
to help against nightmares.

10:00.498 --> 10:02.167
Wow.

10:02.267 --> 10:04.436
My therapist would make
a fortune out of you.

11:38.529 --> 11:41.731
Found some croutons in the cupboard.
I hope they're not expired.

11:46.805 --> 11:48.840
- Man, this place is gorgeous.
- Yeah.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.209
How come you've never
taken me here before?

11:51.309 --> 11:55.444
It's been rented for the past
year and a half or so.

11:56.114 --> 11:58.983
Do you think you're gonna be able
to relax while you're here?

11:59.083 --> 12:02.654
I don't know,
but I think that's up to you.

12:02.754 --> 12:05.089
I'll do my best.

13:52.539 --> 13:54.766
Oh, fuck!

13:55.166 --> 13:56.766
Oh, shit.

14:23.928 --> 14:26.662
Got you, you little fucker.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.959
Come on, boy.

14:45.750 --> 14:48.751
So I leave you for five minutes
and you've destroyed my kitchen.

14:49.721 --> 14:52.790
I just... fixed the garbage disposal.

14:52.990 --> 14:55.458
Yeah, you don't wanna touch that thing.
It's a fucking death trap.

14:57.895 --> 15:00.863
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

15:03.101 --> 15:06.104
Listen, I...
I got a call from the office.

15:06.804 --> 15:07.906
You get reception?

15:08.106 --> 15:11.643
Yeah, about a mile down there's a hillside.
You get a few bars up there.

15:11.743 --> 15:14.078
Yeah, anyway, they called
and said they've had to put

15:14.178 --> 15:16.447
an emergency meeting together
about one of my clients.

15:16.647 --> 15:20.652
Apparently I'm the only guy who can...
who can talk to him, so...

15:21.552 --> 15:24.353
Well, just tell them
you're already with a client.

15:25.123 --> 15:26.622
Anna, I...

15:28.092 --> 15:30.128
So we have to go?

15:30.462 --> 15:32.127
When?

15:32.931 --> 15:34.997
Kinda now.

15:37.218 --> 15:40.138
Look, I'm really sorry. I wouldn't do this
if it wasn't an emergency,

15:40.238 --> 15:42.713
but I've tried him and he's not
picking up. And there's no...

15:42.813 --> 15:45.707
No, it's... it's fine. I understand.

15:46.411 --> 15:48.991
Oh, come on, baby.

15:49.714 --> 15:53.175
Come on. I'll make it up to you.

15:53.785 --> 15:55.787
We can come back again
in a few days if you'd like.

15:55.887 --> 15:57.856
Well, if that's the case,
why don't I just stay here?

15:58.756 --> 16:02.016
Well, 'cause I'm taking the car.
And you'd be here by yourself.

16:02.116 --> 16:04.996
Yeah, but it's fine. I mean,
didn't we just buy enough food for a week?

16:05.096 --> 16:06.831
Well, yeah, but...

16:06.931 --> 16:10.700
And maybe if I'm left alone,
I can get a little writing done.

16:13.571 --> 16:16.151
I'm not a little girl, Paul.

16:20.817 --> 16:22.347
All right.

16:22.447 --> 16:25.529
I'll just do a little checklist of things
you need to know about the house

16:25.629 --> 16:27.283
and I'll leave him for protection.

16:30.087 --> 16:32.066
Protection from what?

16:32.166 --> 16:33.791
- You never know.
- Oh.

16:34.294 --> 16:37.860
- No, he's good company.
- Sure, why not?

16:40.631 --> 16:43.665
Well, it's just me and you now, Shadow.

16:45.369 --> 16:47.579
And my laptop.

18:32.176 --> 18:34.543
All right, fuck it.

18:36.781 --> 18:38.847
Hey, buddy.

18:39.617 --> 18:43.218
Ready to go for a hike? Yeah?

18:44.388 --> 18:47.611
All right, let's do this.

19:53.757 --> 19:57.292
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

20:35.966 --> 20:38.133
Come on, Shadow.

20:42.940 --> 20:45.007
Shadow, come on!

20:50.114 --> 20:51.582
Shadow, come!

20:51.682 --> 20:54.083
- Hey!
- Oh!

20:55.486 --> 20:57.121
I'm sorry.

20:57.221 --> 21:00.358
- What are you doing here?
- I was just out on a hike.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.766
You're out on a hike?

21:05.529 --> 21:07.164
Look, are you some sort of park ranger?

21:07.364 --> 21:11.102
No, I'm not a park ranger,
but this is my home. I live here.

21:11.302 --> 21:12.601
I stay right over there.

21:27.051 --> 21:29.718
Did you come from the glass house?

21:31.755 --> 21:33.591
Yeah.

21:34.091 --> 21:35.459
Is there something wrong?

21:35.559 --> 21:37.728
No. No, there's nothing wrong at all.

21:37.828 --> 21:40.831
I just used to...
I worked for the owner.

21:40.931 --> 21:42.400
Paul.

21:44.268 --> 21:45.903
What did you say your name was?

21:46.745 --> 21:50.141
Anna. I guess we're neighbors, then.

21:50.855 --> 21:52.207
Yeah.

21:54.378 --> 21:56.947
Well... it's nice to meet you.

21:57.047 --> 21:59.851
Let's go, Shadow. Come on.

22:00.251 --> 22:02.517
Shadow, come on.

25:50.314 --> 25:52.380
Oh, God.

30:43.740 --> 30:45.604
Oh, finally!

30:48.678 --> 30:50.814
<i>This is Paul Wagner.
I can't get to the phone right now.</i>

30:50.914 --> 30:53.245
<i>Please leave a message...</i>

30:57.354 --> 30:58.455
<i>Ford and Willis Agency.</i>

30:58.555 --> 31:00.724
- <i>How may I connect your call?</i>
- Paul Wagner.

31:00.824 --> 31:02.993
<i>Mr. Wagner is in a meeting.
Would you like to leave a message?</i>

31:03.093 --> 31:07.264
No, Emily. It's Anna. This is an emergency.
Can you get him on the phone right now?

31:07.364 --> 31:10.058
<i>Hello, Ms. Parker. I'm afraid Mr. Wagner
cannot take your call right now.</i>

31:10.158 --> 31:12.936
No, Emily! You don't understand, okay.
It's an emergency!

31:13.036 --> 31:14.872
I need you to get him
on the phone right now.

31:14.972 --> 31:18.175
I'm just gonna keep calling back
until you get him on.

31:18.275 --> 31:21.476
- <i>One moment, please.</i>
- Thank you.

31:28.883 --> 31:31.722
- Anna.
- Oh, thank God.

31:31.822 --> 31:33.757
<i>What's up?</i>

31:33.857 --> 31:35.959
The... the house isn't safe, Paul.

31:36.059 --> 31:38.205
<i>What do you mean the house isn't safe?
Has somebody broken in?</i>

31:38.305 --> 31:41.198
No, I... I don't know, all right?
Somebody's been there.

31:41.298 --> 31:44.468
- <i>Did you call the police?</i>
- No, I... I wanted to call you first.

31:44.568 --> 31:45.869
When are you coming back?

31:46.430 --> 31:48.438
I don't... I don't know yet.

31:48.538 --> 31:52.664
We've got another meeting tomorrow which
could take a while. Is everything okay?

31:52.764 --> 31:54.753
No, I'm not all right, Paul.
All right? I'm freaking freezing

31:54.853 --> 31:58.115
and I'm standing on a mountain
in the middle of nowhere!

31:58.215 --> 32:01.318
All right, just calm down.
Tell me exactly what happened.

32:01.418 --> 32:03.921
I don't know, but the power went out
and this morning when I woke up,

32:04.021 --> 32:06.757
there were... there were all these numbers
written all over the glass.

32:07.473 --> 32:09.493
Are you sure it wasn't just a bad dream?

32:09.593 --> 32:11.695
No, Paul, please!
You don't understand, all right?

32:11.795 --> 32:14.264
This is different!
I can show you when you get here.

32:14.464 --> 32:16.700
Look, Anna, it's gonna take me
all night to get there.

32:16.800 --> 32:18.535
<i>If you call the police,
they'll be there much faster.</i>

32:18.635 --> 32:21.773
No, I don't want the police. Do you get it?
This place freaks me the fuck out!

32:21.873 --> 32:23.189
I wanna get out of here!

32:25.209 --> 32:28.312
Okay. Okay, just calm down.

32:28.412 --> 32:31.148
<i>I'll tell them to push my schedule.
I'll be there as soon as I can.</i>

32:31.348 --> 32:34.584
Just lock yourself in the house
and everything will be fine, all right?

32:35.445 --> 32:37.282
Fine.

32:42.726 --> 32:44.617
Shit.

32:56.006 --> 32:58.072
Oh, great.

33:32.042 --> 33:33.777
Shit!

33:34.177 --> 33:36.077
Shit!

34:27.831 --> 34:29.498
Oh.

34:31.802 --> 34:34.438
Good boy.

34:34.737 --> 34:37.304
Good boy. Yeah.

34:41.945 --> 34:43.980
You're lucky you had the dog.

34:44.080 --> 34:48.018
It was because of his persistent barking
last night that I even bothered to come over.

34:49.119 --> 34:51.521
How's your head? You must
have a hell of a headache.

34:51.621 --> 34:53.422
How did you get in here?

34:53.523 --> 34:56.426
Well, that would be your keys.

34:57.010 --> 34:59.096
Give me those.

34:59.196 --> 35:01.529
- Give me my fucking keys.
- Easy!

35:06.469 --> 35:08.238
Oh, what are you gonna do with that?

35:08.338 --> 35:09.973
I swear to God, if you don't
give me my fucking keys,

35:10.073 --> 35:12.476
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you!

35:12.576 --> 35:14.411
Okay. All right.

35:14.511 --> 35:17.307
Take your keys.
Nobody's threatening you.

35:17.407 --> 35:19.910
Bullshit! You... you knocked me out
and you dragged me here to...

35:20.010 --> 35:21.651
- To do what?
- I don't know.

35:21.751 --> 35:23.854
I saw you running around last night.

35:23.954 --> 35:27.889
You recognized me, you tripped over a rock,
you cracked your own head.

35:30.493 --> 35:34.298
And the stuff on the wall,
you... you put it there, didn't you?

35:34.898 --> 35:37.232
What the hell are you talking about?

35:45.242 --> 35:47.675
Any idea what it means?

36:01.591 --> 36:02.857
Come out here.

36:05.295 --> 36:07.598
Take a look at this.

36:08.427 --> 36:10.198
These are all the same.

36:17.674 --> 36:21.244
3-0-2-12.

36:21.344 --> 36:24.793
It's a date. March 2nd,

36:24.893 --> 36:26.937
2012.

36:27.517 --> 36:29.352
What?

36:29.652 --> 36:31.087
Who did this?

36:31.887 --> 36:34.524
- I thought you did.
- Why would I do this?

36:34.624 --> 36:36.815
I don't know. I mean, you're the only one
out here. I just assumed.

36:36.915 --> 36:39.027
- I gotta go.
- What does it mean?

36:39.127 --> 36:40.278
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

36:40.378 --> 36:43.585
- I don't know.
- Okay, wait, just...

36:43.900 --> 36:46.467
Look, you don't have to talk
about it, all right?

36:47.637 --> 36:49.396
Will you just...

36:49.496 --> 36:51.814
will you just stay
until it gets light out?

36:52.589 --> 36:54.942
I don't feel safe here.

38:46.289 --> 38:48.056
Hi.

38:50.226 --> 38:52.295
How you feeling?

38:53.321 --> 38:55.365
What time is it?

38:55.465 --> 38:57.567
3:00 in the afternoon.

38:57.667 --> 39:00.000
You slept quite a while.

39:00.937 --> 39:03.440
What happened to your head?

39:03.540 --> 39:05.414
Did you see the numbers?

39:06.609 --> 39:10.311
- What numbers?
- In the bedroom on the window.

39:11.748 --> 39:16.386
No, I didn't see any numbers.
I saw the trash bags. I took them down.

39:16.486 --> 39:19.019
Was it too bright in there for you?

39:29.566 --> 39:31.765
This is ridiculous.

39:35.566 --> 39:37.040
Anna.

39:37.140 --> 39:39.609
- It was all over the place.
- Listen.

39:39.709 --> 39:42.445
There were no numbers on the windows.
There were just a couple of trash bags.

39:42.545 --> 39:44.881
- I took them down, that's all.
- You don't believe me.

39:44.981 --> 39:47.550
No, it's not that I don't believe you.

39:47.650 --> 39:49.386
I don't know, maybe you had
another nightmare.

39:49.486 --> 39:52.822
It wasn't a nightmare, Paul!
It was a date. March 2nd, 2012.

39:52.922 --> 39:56.159
- It was all over!
- Look, stop! Anna, please.

39:56.259 --> 39:58.662
This has gone too far now.

39:58.762 --> 40:03.133
- Does that date mean anything to you?
- No, it doesn't.

40:03.533 --> 40:07.170
You know what? Ask your housekeeper
or groundskeeper, whatever he was.

40:07.270 --> 40:08.972
- He was here. He saw it.
- What, Jeremy?

40:09.072 --> 40:12.308
- Yeah, I think that's what his name was.
- What was he doing here?

40:12.408 --> 40:16.210
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
He helped me! He...

40:18.381 --> 40:22.283
Okay, pack up your things, get ready
to leave. I'm gonna talk to Jeremy now.

41:10.133 --> 41:11.993
Jeremy.

41:54.177 --> 41:56.210
I saw your little trick
with the graffiti.

42:08.424 --> 42:11.258
You can't hide from me, Jeremy!

42:15.164 --> 42:16.766
You try another stunt like that,

42:17.066 --> 42:20.336
I'll have immigration
send you back to Canada.

42:20.436 --> 42:21.569
Little wanker.

45:06.469 --> 45:09.236
Hey, Anna, are you in there?

45:11.607 --> 45:13.476
Yeah.

45:13.576 --> 45:18.378
- Are these bags ready to go now?
- Yeah, you can pack 'em.

45:19.682 --> 45:21.849
Oh, listen, have you seen the key
to the boiler room?

45:23.119 --> 45:25.328
- The what?
- The key for the boiler room.

45:25.428 --> 45:27.156
I need to turn the furnace off
before we go.

45:27.256 --> 45:28.965
Wait.

45:29.792 --> 45:31.461
- I haven't seen them.
- Really?

45:31.661 --> 45:33.327
They're not in your jeans or something?

45:35.064 --> 45:37.133
Hold on a second. I'll be right there.

45:37.797 --> 45:39.864
All right.

45:54.150 --> 45:55.785
Oh, listen, would you mind
hurrying up a little bit?

45:55.885 --> 45:58.187
I don't wanna get snagged up
in rush hour traffic.

45:58.287 --> 46:00.320
Actually...

46:01.790 --> 46:04.291
- Here they are.
- Why don't we stay?

48:11.357 --> 48:13.120
Paul?

48:15.791 --> 48:18.859
Oh, hey. Morning.

48:20.162 --> 48:22.531
So why did you sleep
on the couch last night?

48:22.631 --> 48:24.534
Was I that bad in bed?

48:24.634 --> 48:27.370
No, I... I just couldn't sleep.

48:27.470 --> 48:31.672
- Nightmares again?
- No, thank God.

49:18.788 --> 49:21.462
- All right, I won't be long.
- Okay, I'm gonna go and get gas.

49:21.562 --> 49:23.256
Okay.

49:58.827 --> 49:59.893
Excuse me.

50:02.498 --> 50:04.433
- More coffee?
- No, thanks.

50:04.533 --> 50:08.604
I'm sorry, this might seem a bit random,
but do you know this woman?

50:08.904 --> 50:11.441
She built a modern style glass
house out here,

50:11.541 --> 50:14.058
about 10 miles north
of the old Gamma Ranch.

50:16.712 --> 50:20.747
You may want to talk to Joe over there.
He knows everyone in town.

50:21.951 --> 50:23.717
Thanks.

50:28.757 --> 50:30.891
Excuse me.

50:31.909 --> 50:34.063
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

50:34.163 --> 50:37.567
my name's Anna and I'm looking
for someone from around here.

50:37.667 --> 50:40.501
The bartender said
that you might be able to help.

50:45.474 --> 50:49.892
I'm staying at the glass house.
It's 10 miles north. You know it?

50:50.579 --> 50:53.449
Yeah, I know that house. What about it?

50:54.149 --> 50:57.219
I'm looking for the architect,
Vera Palm.

50:57.319 --> 50:58.919
Does that ring any bells?

51:07.796 --> 51:09.082
Let's talk outside.

51:20.876 --> 51:22.945
I know her housekeeper.

51:23.545 --> 51:25.414
- Jeremy?
- Yes. He...

51:25.514 --> 51:29.118
- comes in for guidance now and then.
- What sort of guidance?

51:29.218 --> 51:33.122
For $39 a session, you can find out.

51:33.222 --> 51:38.060
I also offer a lot of original
healing stones and native artwork.

51:38.160 --> 51:40.527
My shop is right over there.

51:43.699 --> 51:45.668
I think this has been
a misunderstanding.

51:46.268 --> 51:47.501
Are you sure?

51:50.106 --> 51:52.174
Hey, Anna, you ready?

51:52.574 --> 51:54.477
Look, I'm just trying to find
this woman.

51:54.777 --> 51:57.044
Well, you can't. She's missing.

51:57.980 --> 51:59.146
Since when?

52:01.817 --> 52:04.820
- Last March.
- Wait, what happened?

52:05.220 --> 52:07.754
Number's on the card.

52:29.812 --> 52:32.278
Oh, it's freezing in here.

52:34.316 --> 52:36.585
Why don't you take a little nap?

52:36.685 --> 52:40.823
Then when you wake up,
I can grill up some of these...

52:41.123 --> 52:43.990
juicy local steaks I keep hearing about.

52:44.693 --> 52:47.890
You know, I'm really glad
we decided to stay in the end.

52:51.900 --> 52:53.267
Why did you lie to me?

52:54.970 --> 52:56.272
What?

52:56.872 --> 53:00.174
Don't, Paul. Why did you lie to me?

53:03.178 --> 53:06.182
And there was me thinking we might
have a nice, quiet evening together.

53:06.332 --> 53:10.856
- You know what happened on March 2nd.
- Who have you been talking to now?

53:10.956 --> 53:15.555
Doesn't matter. What matters is you didn't
tell me the truth and I wanna know why.

53:17.686 --> 53:21.560
Okay... the truth is
I didn't want to scare you.

53:22.131 --> 53:24.533
It can be pretty intimidating out here
when you're by yourself.

53:25.121 --> 53:28.070
I just didn't wanna fuel
your vivid imagination

53:28.170 --> 53:31.707
with legends about
disappearing people in the desert.

53:32.007 --> 53:34.477
Well, if it's just an urban legend,
then why not tell me?

53:34.577 --> 53:36.310
Because that's what they are.
They're just...

53:43.616 --> 53:44.692
Okay.

53:46.088 --> 53:49.756
The designer of this house,
the architect of this house...

53:50.659 --> 53:52.995
got lost in the desert.

53:53.195 --> 53:56.265
She went for a hike and never came back.

53:56.365 --> 54:01.566
Apparently it happens all the time.
People get lost, but she didn't come back.

54:02.471 --> 54:06.075
- And you're saying you didn't know her.
- Well, how would I?

54:06.966 --> 54:09.278
I don't believe you.

54:09.778 --> 54:11.549
Anna.

54:16.018 --> 54:18.721
I'm getting worried about you now, Anna.

54:18.821 --> 54:20.878
It's... it's somewhere down here.

54:25.928 --> 54:28.964
- Well, I guess you cleaned it out.
- The photograph? Yes, I did.

54:29.164 --> 54:30.499
Because you didn't want me
to see her with you.

54:30.599 --> 54:33.169
Of course I didn't want you
to see me with my ex.

54:33.902 --> 54:36.739
I wouldn't want to see photographs of you
lying around with your ex either.

54:37.139 --> 54:40.841
You're hiding something from me. And don't
just keep blaming it on my vivid imagination.

54:42.111 --> 54:45.214
Oh, really, Anna? Because considering
your history of mental illness...

54:45.314 --> 54:48.367
Nightmares are not
a mental illness, Paul!

54:48.467 --> 54:49.952
Well...

54:50.052 --> 54:53.019
judging by the amount
of medication you're tak...

54:57.559 --> 54:59.326
I know what I've seen.

55:08.237 --> 55:10.804
I made a terrible mistake.

55:14.410 --> 55:15.442
What?

55:21.416 --> 55:23.783
You're right about one thing.

55:26.255 --> 55:28.294
I've been hiding something from you.

55:32.294 --> 55:37.064
I couldn't just watch you pounding
these things down day after day.

55:38.467 --> 55:40.709
They're placebos.

55:42.738 --> 55:45.407
At least you've been having plenty
of vitamin C the last few days.

55:45.607 --> 55:47.543
You switched out my pills?

55:48.416 --> 55:50.168
Yeah.

55:51.146 --> 55:53.814
That's why you've been having
such extreme reactions.

55:56.719 --> 55:58.954
I'm sorry. I thought you could...

55:59.054 --> 56:01.290
do without them.

56:01.390 --> 56:03.357
I was wrong.

56:21.043 --> 56:23.176
What are you doing?

56:24.446 --> 56:26.148
Anna.

56:26.248 --> 56:28.614
Don't touch me!

56:30.886 --> 56:34.454
You know, maybe this writing gig's
just a bit too much pressure for you.

56:36.058 --> 56:39.692
- I can't stay here tonight.
- Oh, God.

56:42.064 --> 56:44.700
- I'm gonna stay in town.
- You serious?

56:44.800 --> 56:48.003
- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Okay, well, listen.

56:48.103 --> 56:51.771
Take these. Have a good night's sleep.

57:44.960 --> 57:46.495
Who is it?

57:46.595 --> 57:51.231
It's Anna. We met this afternoon.
I need to talk to you.

57:58.707 --> 58:00.943
I'm closed.

58:01.243 --> 58:04.310
You can come by again in the morning.

58:05.080 --> 58:07.046
Are you sure?

58:10.686 --> 58:12.603
These are all handcrafted

58:13.555 --> 58:16.180
from various tribes.

58:17.125 --> 58:19.728
Some from my own family, in fact.

58:22.497 --> 58:24.733
Some I just picked up over the years.

58:25.390 --> 58:27.102
Let me know if you're interested
in anything

58:27.202 --> 58:29.404
and I'm sure we could work out
some kind of a discount.

58:29.804 --> 58:31.974
Could we just start the session?

58:32.074 --> 58:33.940
Yeah, of course.

58:35.944 --> 58:38.011
Why don't you...

58:39.080 --> 58:41.848
pick one of these stones.

58:43.352 --> 58:45.885
- This one?
- Sure.

58:47.853 --> 58:49.356
Good choice.

58:56.965 --> 59:00.435
- Really?
- I don't have a free hand for the drums.

59:01.135 --> 59:02.969
This will work just fine.

59:06.108 --> 59:08.641
Just relax.

59:12.781 --> 59:14.876
Why don't you...

59:15.450 --> 59:17.552
take off your top.

59:18.052 --> 59:20.576
You gotta be kidding me.

59:22.925 --> 59:25.759
Do you want me to help you or not?

59:28.730 --> 59:31.697
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

59:33.201 --> 59:35.487
Now lay down.

01:00:07.736 --> 01:00:09.714
Now...

01:00:12.874 --> 01:00:15.778
We'll search for the chakra

01:00:16.678 --> 01:00:19.211
with the most negative energy.

01:00:36.398 --> 01:00:38.232
Whoa.

01:00:40.168 --> 01:00:41.735
What was that?

01:00:43.872 --> 01:00:45.375
What just happened?

01:00:48.376 --> 01:00:49.643
What was that?

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:53.684
Do you ever...

01:00:54.049 --> 01:00:57.614
feel a growing pressure in your chest
when you... when you dream?

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.922
A feeling of numbness in your limbs
almost as if you were paralyzed?

01:01:03.258 --> 01:01:05.056
How did you know that?

01:01:06.161 --> 01:01:10.624
In the native culture, it's known that
spirits can possess the body when you sleep.

01:01:11.867 --> 01:01:15.701
They can capture the soul
and take control of the flesh.

01:01:17.973 --> 01:01:19.574
To do what?

01:01:19.974 --> 01:01:22.478
It depends what you've done.

01:01:22.978 --> 01:01:24.346
But I haven't done anything.

01:01:24.846 --> 01:01:28.550
No, I don't know what's happening
to me, all right? You have to help me.

01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:30.917
Please.

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:44.705
The only... only way
to fight off this spirit

01:01:44.805 --> 01:01:48.136
is to control your dream
and command it to leave.

01:01:48.536 --> 01:01:53.440
We'll... induce a wake-initiated
lucid dream and you'll become conscious.

01:01:55.877 --> 01:01:59.459
When you reach that state, I need you
to perform some sort of physical activity

01:01:59.559 --> 01:02:03.718
so that your muscles will echo
that movement in this realm.

01:02:07.489 --> 01:02:09.022
Lay down.

01:02:17.732 --> 01:02:19.898
Just listen...

01:02:20.669 --> 01:02:22.637
and focus.

01:02:22.837 --> 01:02:26.541
Listen and focus.

01:02:26.941 --> 01:02:30.345
Let yourself sink deep into the bed.

01:02:30.445 --> 01:02:33.079
Let your limbs go numb.

01:02:34.883 --> 01:02:36.904
Okay.

01:02:37.552 --> 01:02:39.619
Don't fight it.

01:02:42.457 --> 01:02:44.392
That's it.

01:02:44.792 --> 01:02:46.859
That's good.

01:02:55.137 --> 01:02:59.107
You are awake... in your dream.

01:02:59.811 --> 01:03:01.309
That's good.

01:03:01.809 --> 01:03:04.980
You're in a state of pure awareness,
but totally...

01:03:07.716 --> 01:03:09.417
paralyzed.

01:03:12.848 --> 01:03:14.756
That's good.

01:03:14.856 --> 01:03:15.924
That's good.

01:04:01.803 --> 01:04:02.969
Stay in control.

01:04:04.806 --> 01:04:06.177
Stay in control!

01:04:17.285 --> 01:04:19.366
Stay in control.

01:04:22.157 --> 01:04:24.390
Stay in control!

01:04:25.493 --> 01:04:26.459
Anna!

01:04:27.575 --> 01:04:29.158
Anna!

01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:09.487
Oh, my God.

01:06:03.758 --> 01:06:05.447
Paul?

01:06:10.598 --> 01:06:12.832
Have a good rest?

01:06:14.002 --> 01:06:16.037
'Cause I didn't.

01:06:16.337 --> 01:06:18.206
Spent the night worried about you.

01:06:18.306 --> 01:06:20.418
Feeling guilty
about swapping out your drugs.

01:06:23.545 --> 01:06:25.211
But then I discovered this.

01:06:31.552 --> 01:06:36.330
Wednesday. Thursday. Friday.

01:06:36.691 --> 01:06:38.624
Sunday.

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:44.063
Where's Saturday, Anna?

01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:49.170
I... I don't know.

01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:51.740
That's weird because...

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.741
Saturday's the night
you were here by yourself.

01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:00.513
Let me show you something.

01:07:10.358 --> 01:07:13.692
I couldn't really care less
about the surveillance cameras.

01:07:14.362 --> 01:07:17.696
Well, it's not as though anything
really happens around here, is it?

01:07:26.374 --> 01:07:30.509
But then Shadow
found something out there.

01:07:36.651 --> 01:07:38.117
And I thought to myself...

01:07:40.054 --> 01:07:43.555
"What is Jeremy's body
doing buried in my backyard?"

01:07:50.198 --> 01:07:52.164
Look...

01:07:53.401 --> 01:07:55.270
I'm sure there is some...

01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:59.071
perfectly rational explanation
for all of this.

01:08:00.442 --> 01:08:02.908
And if there is...

01:08:05.180 --> 01:08:08.414
you should tell me
before I call the police.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.393
I'm gonna make the call.

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:23.798
You should stay here.

01:08:23.898 --> 01:08:26.432
It can get pretty dangerous outside.

01:08:29.537 --> 01:08:32.041
There's nowhere for you to go anyway.

01:09:01.102 --> 01:09:02.639
Come on.

01:10:05.266 --> 01:10:07.332
Come here.

01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:17.932
All right, you stay here, Shadow.
All right? Stay.

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.653
So what now?

01:11:02.190 --> 01:11:04.524
You're not gonna go anywhere.

01:11:06.194 --> 01:11:07.793
Neither are you.

01:11:09.697 --> 01:11:13.313
Well, why would I?
The police will be here in a minute.

01:11:13.413 --> 01:11:16.237
Great, then you can tell them
what happened to Vera Palm.

01:11:16.637 --> 01:11:17.705
What?

01:11:17.805 --> 01:11:20.471
The blind woman who mysteriously
went missing out on the salt lake.

01:11:20.601 --> 01:11:22.043
Who you keep pretending not to know

01:11:22.143 --> 01:11:25.413
although her dog
is standing right over there.

01:11:29.017 --> 01:11:32.754
Yeah, he dug this up
out on the salt lake.

01:11:33.054 --> 01:11:38.544
So tell me, Paul. How did she go missing
if her guide dog was out there with her?

01:11:53.107 --> 01:11:54.660
Vera was my wife.

01:12:01.416 --> 01:12:04.283
She was a very talented, but...

01:12:05.653 --> 01:12:07.822
unsuccessful architect.

01:12:07.922 --> 01:12:10.789
This house was supposed
to change all of that.

01:12:12.894 --> 01:12:17.063
<i>For two years, the only thing she did
was work on this project.</i>

01:12:18.766 --> 01:12:21.036
<i>Day in, day out.</i>

01:12:21.436 --> 01:12:24.539
<i>She became obsessed with the place.</i>

01:12:24.639 --> 01:12:27.808
<i>And by the time she laid
the foundations...</i>

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:31.976
<i>we were living
completely separate lives.</i>

01:12:35.049 --> 01:12:36.983
<i>We were like complete strangers.</i>

01:12:42.924 --> 01:12:45.991
She invited me out here to celebrate
when it was completed.

01:12:46.928 --> 01:12:49.430
<i>Paul? Are you still there?</i>

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:51.032
<i>But why would I?</i>

01:12:51.132 --> 01:12:53.801
<i>I wanted you to come out and celebrate.</i>

01:12:53.901 --> 01:12:56.535
<i>This house had stolen my wife.</i>

01:12:58.406 --> 01:13:00.076
<i>I can't believe you're doing this.</i>

01:13:02.043 --> 01:13:03.422
<i>Paul?</i>

01:13:04.212 --> 01:13:05.478
<i>Paul, are you still there?</i>

01:13:07.915 --> 01:13:09.782
On the way home that night...

01:13:11.619 --> 01:13:14.155
<i>she fell asleep at the wheel</i>

01:13:14.555 --> 01:13:16.789
<i>from sheer exhaustion.</i>

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:22.663
When they found the car, they said...

01:13:22.763 --> 01:13:25.630
that she was lucky because...

01:13:25.967 --> 01:13:29.835
the Joshua tree she hit
stopped her from going over the cliff.

01:13:31.806 --> 01:13:34.807
<i>But a branch came in
through the windscreen and...</i>

01:13:37.345 --> 01:13:39.213
blinded her.

01:13:39.513 --> 01:13:41.716
Then what happened?

01:13:42.116 --> 01:13:43.682
I became her scapegoat.

01:13:47.154 --> 01:13:50.723
<i>If I didn't already feel guilty,
she made me feel guilty.</i>

01:13:54.662 --> 01:13:57.245
<i>She didn't miss a chance</i>

01:13:57.842 --> 01:14:00.295
<i>to make me feel her pain.</i>

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:06.404
<i>I really tried,
but I just couldn't imagine...</i>

01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:11.443
<i>being her caretaker
for the rest of my life.</i>

01:14:16.851 --> 01:14:20.121
So when she started to get better,

01:14:20.888 --> 01:14:23.355
<i>I got her the dog.</i>

01:14:24.825 --> 01:14:28.226
<i>And she came to live out here
by herself.</i>

01:14:30.698 --> 01:14:33.932
<i>My life was finally
becoming normal again.</i>

01:14:36.537 --> 01:14:39.403
And then something fantastic happened.

01:14:41.676 --> 01:14:44.299
I met someone new.

01:14:44.979 --> 01:14:48.347
Someone I could fall in love with again.

01:14:55.856 --> 01:14:59.624
Then Vera called me one day and said...

01:15:00.127 --> 01:15:02.763
said she wanted me to come out here

01:15:02.863 --> 01:15:04.763
to discuss something.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.760
<i>It was the best time we'd had
for over a year.</i>

01:15:11.505 --> 01:15:14.675
<i>Anyway, by the time
we got to the salt lake,</i>

01:15:14.775 --> 01:15:17.463
<i>I realized what it was all about.</i>

01:15:19.547 --> 01:15:23.284
<i>She said she wanted
to move back to Los Angeles,</i>

01:15:23.984 --> 01:15:27.054
<i>have another go at our marriage.</i>

01:15:27.154 --> 01:15:29.891
<i>It was the last thing I wanted to hear.</i>

01:15:30.408 --> 01:15:32.958
So I told her about us.

01:15:33.894 --> 01:15:36.564
<i>She was furious.</i>

01:15:36.664 --> 01:15:39.367
<i>She said she would divorce me.</i>

01:15:39.467 --> 01:15:43.371
<i>I would lose everything.
All my savings, the house.</i>

01:15:43.471 --> 01:15:46.374
She said she would ruin me
if I didn't stay with her.

01:15:46.574 --> 01:15:49.757
Who wouldn't side with a blind woman
whose husband had cheated on her?

01:15:50.978 --> 01:15:53.843
I couldn't let that happen.

01:15:58.419 --> 01:16:00.438
You killed her.

01:16:07.628 --> 01:16:09.666
We'd...

01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:16.634
we'd walked quite a long way
into the salt lake.

01:16:19.206 --> 01:16:21.473
And I just...

01:16:23.544 --> 01:16:26.178
took the dog and kept on walking.

01:16:27.715 --> 01:16:30.281
They never found her body.

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:34.996
This happened on March 2nd.

01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:37.491
Yeah.

01:16:37.891 --> 01:16:39.661
And Jeremy knew.

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:42.563
He saw me coming home without Vera.

01:16:42.663 --> 01:16:45.730
Started asking some questions.

01:16:47.168 --> 01:16:50.202
But an illegal immigrant
is easy to keep quiet.

01:16:50.871 --> 01:16:52.874
You have to tell the police, Paul.

01:16:53.674 --> 01:16:55.192
No, I'm not gonna let her ruin my life.

01:16:55.292 --> 01:16:58.679
No, you don't understand. You have to,
all right? It's the only way she'll stop.

01:16:59.079 --> 01:17:00.514
What are you talking about?

01:17:00.614 --> 01:17:04.885
It was Vera that killed Jeremy
and she's gonna come after you next.

01:17:04.985 --> 01:17:07.188
Have you gone completely nuts?

01:17:09.223 --> 01:17:11.440
If you don't tell the police, I will.

01:17:12.626 --> 01:17:14.662
Well, be my guest.

01:17:14.762 --> 01:17:16.614
I can't wait to see the expression
on their faces

01:17:16.714 --> 01:17:20.237
when a... a drug-abusing writer
with a history of mental illness

01:17:20.337 --> 01:17:25.638
tells them that my ex-wife's ghost
is on some kind of revenge mission.

01:17:34.798 --> 01:17:36.317
I'll let you do the talking.

01:17:36.617 --> 01:17:39.253
<i>She said she would ruin me
if I didn't stay with her.</i>

01:17:39.853 --> 01:17:45.089
<i>Who wouldn't side with a blind woman
whose husband had cheated on her?</i>

01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:50.862
Don't let her do this to us.

01:17:57.738 --> 01:17:59.805
Don't let her separate us, Anna!

01:18:27.501 --> 01:18:29.803
Open the damn door!

01:18:29.903 --> 01:18:31.806
Shit.

01:18:39.212 --> 01:18:40.213
Stand down!

01:18:41.248 --> 01:18:43.916
Officer, thank God you finally arrived.

01:18:47.021 --> 01:18:48.823
You need to drop that rock, sir.

01:18:48.923 --> 01:18:51.092
- No, I know this looks a little weird.
- Drop that rock.

01:18:51.292 --> 01:18:54.626
Officer! Please, you have to help me!
Don't listen to him!

01:18:55.436 --> 01:18:57.998
I need you to drop the rock, sir.
Right now!

01:18:58.098 --> 01:19:00.167
- There's just been a bit of a mis...
- Drop the rock!

01:19:00.267 --> 01:19:03.222
Turn and face the window! Turn and face
the window! Hands behind your head.

01:19:08.575 --> 01:19:10.809
Tell your dog to back off!

01:19:33.734 --> 01:19:36.251
Oh, fuck.

01:19:52.301 --> 01:19:54.225
Shit!

01:19:55.021 --> 01:19:56.890
Fuck!

01:24:05.873 --> 01:24:09.009
Ma'am? Are you all right?

01:24:09.109 --> 01:24:10.833
Can you move?

01:24:10.933 --> 01:24:13.512
Are you okay? Ma'am?
