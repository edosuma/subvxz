00:43.710 --> 00:45.754
- Sookie, you've got to be kidding.
- What?

00:45.838 --> 00:47.756
- You can't walk down the aisle to that.
- Why?

00:47.840 --> 00:49.007
- It's depressing.
- It's Ella.

00:49.091 --> 00:50.884
- It's morbid.
- It's a classic song.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.595
About a woman
who can't make her relationship work...

00:53.679 --> 00:55.848
whose life is full of emptiness,
regret and pain.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.683
Who listens to the lyrics?

00:57.766 --> 01:00.561
Anyone not hanging out
with Annie Sullivan by the water pump.

01:00.686 --> 01:01.645
What are these?

01:01.728 --> 01:04.647
Those are some alternative songs,
but I really like this one.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.900
Alternative songs? Good. Let's see.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.736
- Hey Jude?
- Paul wrote it for Julian to cheer him up.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.155
- Seasons In The Sun?
- A sentimental favorite.

01:12.239 --> 01:15.117
- Cat's In The Cradle?
- It makes you reexamine your priorities.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.786
Don't Cry Out Loud?
Sookie, do you even like Jackson?

01:17.870 --> 01:21.206
- I have a wonderful suggestion.
- Great. Let's hear it.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.542
Okay, here we go. How about I leave?

01:23.584 --> 01:24.960
- And then do what?
- That's it.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.754
I leave and I don't have to listen
to this insanity anymore.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.047
What do you think? I love it.

01:29.131 --> 01:32.718
I am in the wedding, which means
you have to run it all by yourself...

01:32.801 --> 01:34.970
- something you've never done before.
- Please.

01:35.053 --> 01:38.056
How about Lane and I come up
with a few more suggestions?

01:38.140 --> 01:40.851
Still melodic,
but not quite as Girl, Interrupted.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.561
- All right, fine.
- Great.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.479
Michel, how is the RSVP list coming?

01:44.563 --> 01:47.232
I must say this has been
especially challenging for me.

01:47.316 --> 01:50.152
When you are talking about a wedding
with up to 40 people...

01:50.235 --> 01:52.362
all living within a five-mile radius...

01:52.446 --> 01:54.948
how can one person
keep track of all of that?

01:55.032 --> 01:56.116
Just an answer will do.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.412
It got a little hairy there for a moment.
I almost needed a second sheet of paper.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.748
You won't annoy me
out of making you handle it.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.249
We'll see.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.044
My cousin Carl canceled,
so I have two empty seats.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.420
Anyone else you want to invite?

02:09.505 --> 02:11.173
I've got Lane and Dean. I'm good.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.717
- What about Emily and Richard?
- Emily and Richard who?

02:13.800 --> 02:17.221
- Your Emily and Richard.
- Sookie, you're way too sweet.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.474
She took the trouble to help me
plan the first phase of the wedding.

02:20.557 --> 02:23.894
- The crazy phase of the wedding.
- It was sweet and I appreciate it.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.813
If it wasn't for your mother,
I wouldn't have settled on pink.

02:26.897 --> 02:27.898
Why is that?

02:27.981 --> 02:31.235
- I wanted yellow, and she said no.
- With logic like that.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.487
Come on. Just ask her. I want you to.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.405
- Okay, I'll ask her.
- Good.

02:36.031 --> 02:37.074
What are you doing?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.660
It gets happier
the second time you hear it.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.289
Snappier, isn't it?

03:42.764 --> 03:44.474
You know what I just realized?

03:44.558 --> 03:47.394
'Oy' is the funniest word
in the entire world.

03:47.477 --> 03:51.607
I mean, think about it. You never hear
the word 'oy,' and not smile. Impossible.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.151
- Funny, funny word.
- Oh, dear God.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.237
- 'Poodle' is another funny word.
- Please drink up, Lorelai.

03:57.321 --> 04:00.824
If you put 'oy' and 'poodle' together
in the same sentence...

04:00.908 --> 04:02.701
you'd have a great new catchphrase.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.703
Like, 'Oy with the poodles already. '

04:05.245 --> 04:08.457
So from now on,
when the perfect circumstances arise...

04:08.540 --> 04:10.334
we'll use our favorite new catchphrase:

04:10.417 --> 04:11.585
'Oy with the poodles already. '

04:11.668 --> 04:13.879
It's knocking
'What you talking about, Willis?'...

04:13.921 --> 04:16.255
- out of first place.
- For God's sake, be quiet.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.673
Dinner's ready, Mrs. Gilmore.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.427
Bless you, Inger. Please tell Mr. Gilmore.
He's in his den.

04:20.511 --> 04:21.512
Yes, ma'am.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.055
- Shall we?
- Okay.

04:24.598 --> 04:29.228
Sookie wanted to know if you and Dad
would like to come to her wedding.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.063
- Really?
- Yeah, it's gonna be great.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.981
Small, low-key, but fun.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.984
She's catering it herself,
so the food will be fantastic...

04:36.068 --> 04:38.195
and you'd see me and Rory
walk down the aisle...

04:38.278 --> 04:41.198
in two of the least obnoxious
bridesmaids' dresses created.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.242
That sounds very nice. When is it?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.743
A week from Sunday.

04:45.369 --> 04:46.912
- A week from Sunday?
- Yes.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.622
- The wedding is in one week?
- Yes.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.624
- So this is a pity invite?
- A what?

04:50.707 --> 04:52.334
Someone canceled at the last minute...

04:52.417 --> 04:54.711
and rather than being left
with empty seats...

04:54.795 --> 04:56.421
she asked you to ask us. How nice.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.966
- That's not what happened.
- No, that's quite all right.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.928
Far be it for me to be invited with
the first batch of actual wanted guests.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.012
This is just fine.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.515
It's not a pity invite.
She really wants you to come.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.267
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.477
- Where is our invitation?
- What?

05:10.561 --> 05:11.603
Our invitation.

05:11.687 --> 05:14.481
She must have at least given you
an invitation to give us.

05:14.565 --> 05:17.276
She felt it would be more special
coming directly from me.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.195
So she was out of invitations.
I never felt so special.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.823
She wants you to come.
There's no reason to be insulted.

05:22.906 --> 05:26.785
I guess I should be thrilled I didn't get
a call as you were on your way there.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.787
Do not turn this into something it's not.

05:28.829 --> 05:32.166
Do we have a choice between
chicken or fish, or do we bring our own?

05:32.249 --> 05:33.959
- Stop.
- Perhaps she would like us...

05:34.001 --> 05:37.504
to pick up some ice along the way,
or help out parking the cars.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.298
Mom, look, isn't Rory pretty?

05:39.339 --> 05:42.426
Apologies all around. I could not
get Adamson off the phone.

05:42.509 --> 05:46.263
We were just talking about how pretty
Rory is. Give him the baby face.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.641
- Rory gets lovelier every day.
- Thank you, Grandpa.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.976
- Richard.
- Oh, God.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.228
- Guess what Lorelai just told me.
- What?

05:53.312 --> 05:54.980
We are invited to Sookie's wedding.

05:55.063 --> 05:58.275
- How nice. When is it?
- A week from Sunday.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.486
So it's a pity invite.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.238
Oy with the poodles already.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.369
- How are your pancakes?
- Good.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.330
- Good or really good?
- Good.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.665
- So not really good?
- Fine. Really good.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.708
Okay.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.461
But are they great?

06:18.045 --> 06:21.298
Rory, would you perhaps
like to trade breakfasts?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.467
- You mean your pancakes for my eggs?
- Yeah.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.510
Okay.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.809
You're crazy. These pancakes are great.

06:33.852 --> 06:34.811
That's 12.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.898
- Two more and she'll come in.
- I don't know.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.192
She's been walking back and forth
for 20 minutes...

06:40.275 --> 06:41.902
and still hasn't made it to the door.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.446
But look how much closer
to the building she's gotten.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.365
Why don't we just
bring her something out?

06:46.406 --> 06:49.701
No, she and Luke have been fighting
for too long. She has to do this.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.912
- You're cruel.
- Tough love, baby.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.790
- I think she's coming in.
- How can you tell?

06:54.873 --> 06:57.251
She's got the shoe-sale face on.

06:57.376 --> 07:00.337
- Okay, I did it. I'm in.
- Good girl.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.507
That wasn't so bad.
It took a while, but not so bad.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.844
- Wait. Why are you eating?
- You took 30 minutes to come in.

07:06.885 --> 07:09.555
- But I'm here now, and I'm like cheese.
- What?

07:09.638 --> 07:10.681
She gets better with time.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.308
- Sorry, we got school.
- But...

07:13.433 --> 07:15.185
Order breakfast. I'll leave the paper.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.896
- See you tonight.
- Dean, don't leave me.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.815
You'll be fine.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.953
- Hey.
- Hello.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.956
Good doughnut selection
this morning, really.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.042
Good variety, good color, good goodness.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.714
Well, so the choices are there.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.300
It all comes down to
what I'm in the mood for.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.011
Sprinkled or chocolate or jelly or glazed.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.847
Maple or sticky or apple or raised.

07:53.724 --> 07:55.434
A little doughnut rhyme there.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.937
Never mind. Can I have
a chocolate and a sprinkled?

08:02.107 --> 08:05.903
- So this is how it's gonna be with us now?
- No idea what you're talking about.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.822
- You're pulling a 'Mr. Freeze' on me.
- I'm not.

08:08.906 --> 08:11.200
I'm gonna need snow chains
just to get out of here.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.493
I assume you want coffee
with your doughnuts?

08:13.577 --> 08:18.290
I'm sorry, Luke. It was a bad night.
I completely freaked out.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.625
I said some things.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.211
- Did you get my note?
- I got your note.

08:22.294 --> 08:24.004
- Did you read my note?
- I read your note.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.547
- And?
- It was very well-written.

08:25.631 --> 08:26.632
That's it?

08:26.715 --> 08:29.593
I also enjoyed the Garfield stationary.
That's one funny cat.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.637
- I said I was sorry.
- Yes, you did.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.264
- I said it a million times.
- You said it four times...

08:34.347 --> 08:36.933
but I understand
you're embellishing for dramatic effect.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.143
- Stop.
- Stop what?

08:38.227 --> 08:42.188
Stop this robot talk. If you're mad,
just act like you're mad at me.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.273
I'm not mad at you.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.734
You're being really unfair.
Rory was in the hospital.

08:45.817 --> 08:50.364
What is it exactly that you want me to do?
I'm not mad. I'm not holding a grudge.

08:50.447 --> 08:54.368
I heard your apology. I'm being polite.
I listened to your doughnut bit.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.496
I got you your coffee.
What would make you happy?

09:00.374 --> 09:03.877
- I want Luke back.
- He's standing right here.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.338
No, he's not.

09:14.304 --> 09:18.433
Better drinking fountains, updated lockers,
clearly marked boys'and girls' restrooms.

09:18.517 --> 09:21.478
Non-dairy and wheat-free alternatives
in the cafeteria.

09:21.562 --> 09:24.648
A larger voice in the monetary disbursal
of charitable funds...

09:24.731 --> 09:26.859
donated to our institution.

09:26.942 --> 09:30.445
Because it is our institution,
yours and mine.

09:30.529 --> 09:35.492
Remember, people. If Chilton soars,
we soar. If Chilton fails, we fail.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.037
It is up to us. We must get involved.
We must care.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.873
It is not enough to sign a petition...

09:40.956 --> 09:43.792
to get a Little Debbie machine installed
in the corridor.

09:43.876 --> 09:46.128
Snack cakes will not change the world.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.630
Cream filling will not decide our legacy.

09:48.755 --> 09:53.051
How will future generations of Chilton
students remember the Class of 2003?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.553
John F. Kennedy once said:

09:54.595 --> 09:57.055
'Ask not what your country
can do for you...

09:57.139 --> 09:59.474
'ask what you can do for your country. '

09:59.933 --> 10:03.353
Those eloquent words are just as relevant
here in this hall today.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.479
What can you...

10:04.563 --> 10:07.649
the future of Chilton,
of America, of the world...

10:07.733 --> 10:09.568
what can you do for your school?

10:09.610 --> 10:11.361
I will tell you what you can do.

10:11.445 --> 10:14.907
You can vote for me, Paris Geller,
for Student Body President.

10:15.032 --> 10:17.784
And let me start tomorrow for you today.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.373
Thank you.

10:25.083 --> 10:28.837
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to
thank Reese McKinley, Schotzie Leasen...

10:28.921 --> 10:31.798
and Paris Geller,
your presidential candidates for next year.

10:31.882 --> 10:35.093
Elections will be held this Friday.
Good luck to all of you.

10:35.177 --> 10:38.680
This concludes today's assembly.
You are all dismissed.

10:53.654 --> 10:54.988
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:55.072 --> 10:56.782
Did you get the 'Little Debbie' comment?

10:56.865 --> 10:58.617
All of it? Cream filling and snack cake?

10:58.659 --> 11:01.245
- Every delicious morsel.
- Good, good.

11:02.955 --> 11:04.790
So how do you think it went?

11:04.832 --> 11:05.833
I think it went fine.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.126
Fine as in better than Reese and Schotzie?

11:08.252 --> 11:10.796
- Fine as in fine.
- How are you skewing the article?

11:10.879 --> 11:13.507
You'll have to wait and read about it
like everyone else.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.008
- Write whatever you want.
- I will.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.301
Make sure you mention that...

11:16.343 --> 11:18.887
Schotzie pulling the Sharon Stone,
Basic Instinct bit...

11:18.971 --> 11:21.139
was an attempt
to distract the student body...

11:21.223 --> 11:23.684
- from my mandatory recycling program.
- Go away.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.270
- I got it.
- You do? Come on, tell me.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.815
- Okay, 150 students were polled.
- A total cross-section.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.943
We talked to people that
we should never even have to stand near.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.071
The hairstyles proved
the Farrelly brothers are not making it up.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.740
Have I ever been mistaken
for a patient person?

11:38.824 --> 11:41.285
Right, sorry. So we added the votes up.

11:41.326 --> 11:42.661
- You added?
- She added.

11:42.744 --> 11:43.745
Continue.

11:43.829 --> 11:47.708
When asked who is the most qualified
for the job of President...

11:47.791 --> 11:49.293
- 90% said you.
- Really?

11:49.334 --> 11:52.462
When asked who would be
the most competent President...

11:52.546 --> 11:54.590
the answer was, once again, you.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.425
- So that's it. I'm in.
- Not quite.

11:56.508 --> 11:59.178
Most competent, most qualified.
What else is there?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.763
- We also polled likeability.
- And?

12:01.847 --> 12:04.349
- While people think you're smart...
- And competent.

12:04.433 --> 12:08.187
And competent, they also find you,
well, a tad...

12:08.270 --> 12:09.313
Scary.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.107
Someone thought
a Halloween mask of you would sell big.

12:12.191 --> 12:14.735
Well, fine. They don't like me.
Big deal, right?

12:14.818 --> 12:16.653
- I'm still most competent.
- Yes.

12:16.737 --> 12:20.282
But when asked if the likeability issue
would affect their voting choice...

12:20.365 --> 12:22.826
- almost 100% said yes.
- That's crazy.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.412
People would vote for a moronic twink
who they liked...

12:25.496 --> 12:27.206
over someone
who can actually do the job?

12:27.289 --> 12:29.708
- Sad but true.
- Well, what do I do?

12:29.791 --> 12:31.668
Hope for a sex scandal?

12:31.752 --> 12:33.962
- Louise?
- I'm on it.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.972
- Hey.
- Tomorrow, with everyone else.

12:44.056 --> 12:46.391
I have been racking my brains for weeks...

12:46.433 --> 12:49.728
trying to figure out who should be
my Vice-Presidential candidate.

12:49.811 --> 12:53.106
Who would be yin to my yang,
Joel to my Ethan, Damon to my Affleck?

12:53.190 --> 12:56.568
And then, suddenly, it hits me.
The perfect person.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.778
- Who?
- You.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.279
- What?
- It's genius.

12:59.363 --> 13:02.074
We could announce it tomorrow.
Geller and Gilmore.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.536
We even have a 'G' thing. Never
underestimate the power of alliteration.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.079
I don't want to be Vice-President.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.873
- Every girl wants to be Vice-President.
- Not this one.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.626
You have to. It's the only way.
Please, I'm begging you.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.711
- Paris...
- They hate me, okay?

13:14.795 --> 13:17.923
- Who hates you?
- Everyone in the whole school hates me.

13:18.006 --> 13:21.593
They think I'm the best for the job,
but they won't vote for me...

13:21.677 --> 13:22.928
so I'm going to lose.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.430
How is my running with you
gonna change anything?

13:25.472 --> 13:29.518
Because people think you're nice.
You're quiet. You say, 'Excuse me. '

13:29.601 --> 13:32.521
You look like birds help you get dressed.
They don't fear you.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.773
I haven't been dressed by a bird
since I was two.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.984
- You will soften my image.
- You're crazy.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.444
- Please?
- No, I don't want to be in politics.

13:39.486 --> 13:40.821
I just want to write about it.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.197
You won't have to do anything.

13:42.281 --> 13:43.949
I'll do the work and make the speeches.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.285
- You just have to sit there and be nice.
- No. Bye.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.412
Harvard loves this kind of crap.

13:52.291 --> 13:55.335
Being Vice-President is just
one more thing to put you ahead...

13:55.419 --> 13:57.629
of the thousands of straight A students...

13:57.671 --> 13:59.506
who are applying
for the same spot you are.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.341
Think about it. You say no...

14:01.425 --> 14:03.927
then comes the day
when the letter from Harvard arrives.

14:04.011 --> 14:07.347
They've turned you down.
Enjoy Connecticut State, sucker.

14:07.431 --> 14:10.559
Tell me you won't be thinking,
'What if I had just run with Paris?'

14:10.642 --> 14:13.270
'What if the one thing
that could have ensured my place...

14:13.312 --> 14:16.315
'behind those ivy-covered walls
I just walked away from?'

14:18.025 --> 14:20.110
- Fine.
- Yes. Okay.

14:20.194 --> 14:22.863
I guess just being nice to people
never occurred to you?

14:22.946 --> 14:24.615
That is exactly what I need from you.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.909
Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm
for the new millennium.

14:26.992 --> 14:30.704
Wear some braids tomorrow, with bows.
Hell, let's sell it, sister.

14:31.955 --> 14:33.040
- How do you feel?
- Great.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.959
- Not at all sad?
- About getting my arm back? No.

14:36.043 --> 14:39.254
Really? 'Cause I've kind of
gotten used to Castie over here.

14:39.338 --> 14:42.883
We decorated him. We talked to him.
We protected him from getting wet.

14:42.966 --> 14:45.928
It's time to stop getting attached
to inanimate objects.

14:46.011 --> 14:49.014
Castie, no one understands you like I do.
What?

14:49.681 --> 14:52.309
No, I did not know
Mr. Band-Aid said that to you.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.603
I will talk to him when we get home.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.480
- How are you doing?
- Dr. Sue, thank God.

14:56.522 --> 14:59.149
Rory, let's get this thing off your arm.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.651
- What do you say?
- Not a word.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.694
This one here? Which one?

15:03.111 --> 15:05.197
Hey, you in the white.
Come on, point a finger.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.616
- Dad?
- Christopher?

15:07.866 --> 15:09.117
There you are.

15:09.201 --> 15:11.036
- Is it still on?
- What are you doing?

15:11.119 --> 15:13.038
Great, I didn't miss it.

15:13.080 --> 15:15.040
- Hey, Doctor, I'm Dad.
- Nice to meet you.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.250
I can't believe you're here.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.544
I told you I wanted to come
for the big unveiling.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.797
But I didn't think you would drive
all the way from Boston again.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.590
- You getting sick of me?
- Frankly, yes.

15:23.674 --> 15:25.592
- Everyone here now?
- I think so.

15:25.676 --> 15:26.802
Then let's do it.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.721
And if at all possible,
we'd like to keep the arm.

15:29.805 --> 15:31.348
I'll try my best.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.646
- So where to next?
- I have to get home.

15:37.729 --> 15:40.399
- I have to review my campaign platform.
- Campaign platform?

15:40.482 --> 15:44.069
Our little Hillary Clinton here is running
for Student Body Vice-President.

15:44.611 --> 15:49.116
Elections are on Friday, but I'm very torn
about which way I want it to go.

15:49.199 --> 15:51.910
I spent four hours making picture buttons.
You want to win.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.288
If I win, I have to be
Vice-President next year.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.874
Plus, I'll have to spend
my summer in Washington...

15:56.957 --> 15:58.417
for a junior leadership program...

15:58.458 --> 16:01.461
which means six weeks
of me and Paris together in a dorm room.

16:01.545 --> 16:05.048
How about this? I'll come back
on Thursday and take you guys to dinner.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.467
Then we'll break into Chilton
and tamper with votes.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.803
- We can't.
- Thursday is Sookie's rehearsal dinner.

16:09.887 --> 16:13.265
Then you have to put your trust
in the democratic system. Good luck.

16:13.348 --> 16:16.602
If you're gonna be in the area
Thursday night, you could come with us.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.395
But it's Sookie's rehearsal dinner.

16:18.437 --> 16:21.356
She would love it. She's cooking
for a thousand. It'll be fun.

16:21.440 --> 16:22.774
I'm bringing Dean.

16:22.858 --> 16:25.110
- If you can't do it, then...
- What time?

16:25.152 --> 16:26.612
- 7:30 p. m.
- I'm there.

16:27.112 --> 16:29.031
That's great. I'll tell her.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.369
A toast. Everybody, a toast.

16:34.453 --> 16:36.955
Ladies, gentlemen, honored guests...

16:38.165 --> 16:40.876
who owns the silver Volvo?
'Cause you're blocking me in.

16:41.835 --> 16:45.339
Well, it's better than the toast
he made at the Abromowitz wedding.

16:45.756 --> 16:49.134
- How long before I move the car?
- Give it another 10 minutes.

16:49.176 --> 16:52.721
Come on, I've got to go.
My mom is waiting. This isn't funny.

16:54.723 --> 16:55.807
We need to talk.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.643
- What's the matter?
- The bedroom, please.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.479
- I'm melting chocolate here.
- The chocolate can wait.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.856
My father just took me aside
and handed me this.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.150
- He handed you a skirt?
- It's not a skirt.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.359
It's a kilt.

17:07.236 --> 17:08.654
Why did he hand this to you?

17:08.694 --> 17:10.864
He gave this to me
to wear on my wedding day.

17:10.948 --> 17:12.616
- No.
- Yes.

17:12.657 --> 17:15.993
He wore it at his wedding.
My grandfather wore it at his wedding.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.829
Apparently there's a tradition...

17:17.871 --> 17:20.749
where the men in my family
get very airy on the big day.

17:21.333 --> 17:24.795
- Well, honey, if it means that much to him.
- Are you crazy?

17:24.920 --> 17:26.046
He's your father.

17:26.128 --> 17:30.008
You won't let me wear shorts in public,
but you're letting me get married in this?

17:30.092 --> 17:32.344
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna wear pants.

17:32.386 --> 17:34.137
If he doesn't like it, let him not come.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.056
He has to come. He's the best man.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.183
- Too bad.
- Jackson, come on.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.227
Shorts are different. They cut you funny.

17:40.310 --> 17:44.022
Okay, that's it. I need some air.
Grab the bottle.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.817
Bossy. I like it.

17:50.195 --> 17:53.115
Wow. I hope the second act
is as good as the first one.

17:53.198 --> 17:56.160
Well, it's a wedding.
Things are supposed to be horrible.

17:56.368 --> 18:00.330
When Jackson came out holding that kilt,
I felt for him.

18:00.414 --> 18:01.790
I know. So did I.

18:01.874 --> 18:03.584
Please, I saw what your face was doing.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.043
What was my face doing?

18:05.127 --> 18:07.171
Counting
how many Brigadoon references...

18:07.254 --> 18:09.965
you could come up with
to torture him with on a later date.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.592
How dare you accuse my face of that?

18:11.675 --> 18:13.844
My face is calling Gloria Allred
when we get home.

18:13.886 --> 18:15.053
- How many references?
- None.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.138
How many?

18:16.555 --> 18:20.267
Twelve. Including a few bars
of I'll Go Home With Bonnie Jean.

18:20.350 --> 18:23.270
I'm begging you,
take plenty of pictures at this wedding...

18:23.353 --> 18:25.272
because I have a feeling it'll be a classic.

18:25.355 --> 18:29.359
If you are gonna be in town for the day,
you should just come with us...

18:30.235 --> 18:33.071
- and see all the fireworks for yourself.
- Okay.

18:34.031 --> 18:36.074
- Okay?
- Yeah.

18:36.158 --> 18:38.785
- Just like that, okay?
- If Sookie doesn't mind.

18:38.869 --> 18:40.829
- What's going on with you?
- What do you mean?

18:40.913 --> 18:42.831
I mean, Mr. Suddenly-I'm-Everywhere...

18:42.915 --> 18:45.501
how come you can just
agree to come to the wedding?

18:45.584 --> 18:46.585
Because I can.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.462
Don't you have to check
your appointments?

18:48.545 --> 18:51.590
- It's on a Sunday.
- Don't you have to check with Sherry?

18:53.759 --> 18:55.928
- Chris, what's up?
- Nothing.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.639
Sherry's not in town.

18:58.722 --> 19:01.475
Even if she was,
I still don't think she'd mind.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.602
Because she's the coolest chick
in the world?

19:03.685 --> 19:07.189
Because things aren't going
too well for us lately.

19:07.272 --> 19:10.526
- Oh, no.
- She had this big business trip planned.

19:10.609 --> 19:12.444
And before she left, we had a talk.

19:12.486 --> 19:13.779
- Yikes.
- Yeah.

19:13.820 --> 19:17.324
We tried to come up with some answers,
but we couldn't think of anything.

19:17.491 --> 19:21.036
So she left, and we said
we'd take this time apart to think.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.955
And what have you been thinking?

19:22.996 --> 19:25.040
About finding an apartment.

19:25.249 --> 19:27.459
Wow. That's so weird.

19:27.626 --> 19:31.755
The last time I saw you two,
you were both nauseating, actually.

19:32.756 --> 19:35.175
We made ourselves sick a few times.

19:35.259 --> 19:37.970
- I don't know what to say.
- No, there's nothing to say.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.890
It's nobody's fault. It just isn't it.

19:42.266 --> 19:46.228
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay. Thanks.

19:46.311 --> 19:50.357
Well, then it's decided. You'll come
with me to Sookie's wedding...

19:50.482 --> 19:51.900
and you make sure I stop...

19:51.984 --> 19:55.863
one or two brigadoonisms shy
of Jackson taking me out with a bagpipe.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.614
It would be my pleasure.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.577
Oh, my God. I'm so tired.

20:01.660 --> 20:03.036
- Hey, Mom.
- Yes, angel?

20:03.120 --> 20:05.789
Do you know where the almonds
I made for Table 5 went?

20:05.831 --> 20:06.832
No.

20:06.915 --> 20:09.042
They were here last night
before Sookie's dinner.

20:09.126 --> 20:10.335
- Really, how odd?
- Yeah.

20:10.419 --> 20:14.047
And this morning, I found some
on the staircase leading to your bedroom.

20:14.131 --> 20:15.132
Ghosts?

20:15.215 --> 20:17.926
It took me six hours
to make those almond bundles.

20:18.010 --> 20:20.095
Well, see if you can beat that next time.

20:20.179 --> 20:22.139
So you got home late from Sookie's?

20:22.222 --> 20:24.391
Yeah, I stayed to help her clean up a little.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.476
- Guess what?
- What?

20:26.518 --> 20:29.229
- I know something you don't know.
- What?

20:29.313 --> 20:31.899
Okay, just remember
it's really wrong to gossip...

20:31.982 --> 20:35.736
unless it's true or just way too good
not to tell everyone you see...

20:35.819 --> 20:37.905
- whether you know them or not.
- What is it?

20:39.198 --> 20:43.243
That's my conscience calling.
Tell it enough already.

20:43.327 --> 20:45.621
- Hello?
- How's this sound for a template?

20:45.704 --> 20:49.666
'I have done my best. I have lost.
Mr. Nixon has won.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.877
'The democratic process
has worked its will...

20:51.960 --> 20:55.047
'so now let's get on with the urgent task
of uniting this country. '

20:55.130 --> 20:57.799
- What is that?
- Hubert Humphrey's concession speech.

20:57.883 --> 21:01.345
Other than the part about Nixon,
parts of it really seem to apply here.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.222
- Paris...
- I'm not going to steal it.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.265
I'll paraphrase and give him credit.

21:05.349 --> 21:09.561
Not that the person who actually wins
will even know who Hubert Humphrey is...

21:09.645 --> 21:12.105
but I bet they'll organize
one boffo senior ditch day.

21:12.189 --> 21:14.191
- Where are you?
- In the auditorium.

21:14.233 --> 21:16.360
I wanted to be here
for one last meet-and-greet.

21:16.443 --> 21:19.154
- Get them before they go to the booth.
- Leave now.

21:19.238 --> 21:21.031
- But...
- People will think you're insane...

21:21.073 --> 21:24.701
and generally people are scared
of the insane. See where I'm going here?

21:24.743 --> 21:26.745
- I'm going to lose.
- You don't know that.

21:26.829 --> 21:28.372
Yes, I do.

21:28.747 --> 21:33.585
Because even if I win, I only won
because of you. So either way, I lose.

21:33.710 --> 21:36.713
Come on. Go get a cup of coffee. Relax.

21:36.797 --> 21:40.384
You deserve this job. I swear.
Put away the concession speech.

21:41.051 --> 21:43.929
Hubert Humphrey must not
have been considered very fun either.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.931
I'll see you at school.

21:45.973 --> 21:50.602
God, she wants to win so badly,
and me not so badly. I feel terrible.

21:50.686 --> 21:52.020
You know you wanna win...

21:52.104 --> 21:54.231
so you can spend your summer
in Washington.

21:54.273 --> 21:57.192
Don't even talk about Washington.
It gives me a stomach ache.

21:57.276 --> 21:59.695
- It'd be wonderful.
- Then you and I will go some day.

21:59.778 --> 22:03.657
Look at you.
Trying to make Mommy feel better.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.410
- Get back to the gossip, please.
- Yeah, okay.

22:06.618 --> 22:09.329
So, guess who's in the process
of breaking up?

22:09.413 --> 22:10.914
- Fred and Jen?
- Bite your tongue.

22:10.998 --> 22:12.082
I don't know.

22:12.666 --> 22:14.209
Sherry and your dad.

22:14.293 --> 22:15.460
- No.
- Yes.

22:15.544 --> 22:17.045
- Dad told you that?
- Last night.

22:17.129 --> 22:19.506
Wow. But they were so together.

22:19.590 --> 22:21.633
I know. Well, now they're not.

22:21.717 --> 22:23.468
Well, is he...

22:23.552 --> 22:24.928
- Look at you.
- What?

22:24.970 --> 22:27.973
- You're totally gloating.
- I'm not gloating.

22:28.015 --> 22:31.226
- Why are you smiling?
- I am not smiling.

22:31.310 --> 22:34.146
- I had a little stroke.
- You're smiling.

22:35.147 --> 22:39.026
If he was all broken up about it,
then I'd be sad. But he's not. So...

22:39.109 --> 22:40.736
Fourth rung of hell, party of one.

22:40.819 --> 22:43.155
Well, at least my feet won't get cold.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.032
Where did you get that?

22:45.824 --> 22:47.242
- What?
- That.

22:47.326 --> 22:50.162
The Jordan almond you pulled out
of your pajama top and ate.

22:50.245 --> 22:52.998
- Where did you get it?
- Santa Claus.

23:00.923 --> 23:04.259
All right, the piano movers
will be here at 8:00...

23:04.343 --> 23:06.303
and the chairs will be set up at 9:00.

23:06.386 --> 23:09.681
All the rooms are made up and ready.
I will be in at 10:00.

23:09.723 --> 23:12.184
I am going home,
unless you want me to stay.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.311
Actually, I would. Thanks.

23:15.270 --> 23:18.315
No, I'm sorry. I think I said that wrong.

23:18.398 --> 23:21.109
I am going home now,
unless you want me to stay.

23:21.193 --> 23:23.028
I would love you to stay. Thanks.

23:23.111 --> 23:26.365
Okay, once again, my English, not so good.
One more time.

23:26.406 --> 23:30.661
I am going home now after working
six hours longer than I usually work...

23:30.702 --> 23:33.664
and performing tasks I despise
and I'm ashamed of.

23:33.705 --> 23:37.876
Now I am going home to wash off
the stench of this horrifying day...

23:37.960 --> 23:41.129
that is, unless, for some unknown,
godforsaken reason...

23:41.213 --> 23:43.590
you need me to stay.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.260
- Well, actually...
- Goodbye.

23:47.761 --> 23:51.181
Can I grab my bag?
I'll go in the back and change. Thank you.

23:51.682 --> 23:54.768
Hey, I went with the sugar daffodils
for the top tier.

23:54.852 --> 23:58.480
Let me tell you, they look great.
I've outdone myself this time.

23:58.564 --> 24:01.900
- What are you still doing here?
- I want to double check everything.

24:01.984 --> 24:05.404
Don't worry. I'm done. Everything's fine.
I'm going straight to bed.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.406
- Your last night as a single woman.
- Yep.

24:07.447 --> 24:09.408
- You still look good.
- I still feel good.

24:09.491 --> 24:13.036
From tomorrow, you can wear cold cream
to bed and stop shaving your legs.

24:13.078 --> 24:15.914
- That's right,'cause I got me a man.
- Go to sleep.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.542
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

24:29.761 --> 24:33.557
Look who's got Martha Stewart
locked in a basement. Did you do all this?

24:33.599 --> 24:36.018
Yeah, I did. How's it look?

24:36.101 --> 24:37.936
- It looks great.
- Good.

24:37.978 --> 24:40.105
- What are you doing up?
- I couldn't sleep.

24:40.272 --> 24:43.525
I sweet-talked the maid into leaving me
10,000 pillow mints...

24:43.609 --> 24:45.277
and I ate them all.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.820
Serves you right.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.364
Oh, God. I'm so exhausted.

24:49.489 --> 24:52.493
- You need some help?
- No, I'm almost done.

24:56.997 --> 25:00.292
I got up and went back to work
just now, didn't I?

25:00.334 --> 25:02.336
- Yes, you did.
- Good.

25:02.836 --> 25:05.047
This is not the time to loaf.

25:06.256 --> 25:07.966
I'm so happy for Sookie.

25:08.008 --> 25:10.969
It's like a real, live love story.

25:11.011 --> 25:12.846
I saw it all happen.

25:12.930 --> 25:16.350
I mean, I hired Jackson.
I watched them meet.

25:16.808 --> 25:21.438
I watched them have several bizarrely
intense arguments over mustard greens.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.066
I watched them fall in love.

25:25.526 --> 25:28.612
I got to see it all. It was a nice show.

25:37.955 --> 25:39.957
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:50.843 --> 25:53.512
- What was that?
- I have no idea.

25:59.643 --> 26:02.145
One more time,
and maybe I'll have an explanation.

26:05.607 --> 26:08.569
- This is not happening.
- I hope to God you're wrong.

26:09.570 --> 26:13.532
But it's us. I mean, you and I, we...

26:13.615 --> 26:16.660
Have never been in the same place
at the same time.

26:17.452 --> 26:18.871
But now...

26:25.377 --> 26:28.964
- My head is spinning.
- It's the plants in here, too much oxygen.

26:29.381 --> 26:31.091
What do we do now?

26:31.842 --> 26:35.846
- You know, I've got a room upstairs.
- You were that sure you'd get lucky?

26:35.888 --> 26:38.223
I never dreamed I'd get this lucky.

26:39.808 --> 26:42.227
- That's good.
- So what do you say?

27:18.764 --> 27:21.558
- What are you doing?
- Daffodils. Am I insane?

27:21.600 --> 27:24.478
Can't have daffodils on the wedding cake.
What was I thinking?

27:24.561 --> 27:27.064
- Stop what you're doing now.
- There's too much pink.

27:27.105 --> 27:29.691
- This is not too much pink.
- Pink is for girls.

27:29.775 --> 27:32.277
Jackson's not a girl.
Jackson doesn't like pink.

27:32.361 --> 27:35.239
I have all this pink.
It's like saying,'Screw you.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.616
'You want a say in this?
Well, grow some ovaries. '

27:37.658 --> 27:41.453
- Hey, put the pastry bag down.
- I can't. I have to fix this.

27:41.537 --> 27:42.830
Sookie, down.

27:44.998 --> 27:47.459
Step away from all things edible.

27:51.505 --> 27:53.799
- What happened?
- I don't know.

27:53.882 --> 27:55.634
When I left you, you were fine.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.971
When I went home, I was fine.
When I went to bed, I was fine.

27:59.054 --> 28:03.892
Then I had this dream where my dress
is really short in the back, you know?

28:03.976 --> 28:06.854
I bolt out of bed and put my dress on.
It looks okay.

28:06.937 --> 28:09.523
But then I panic.
What if I remember the dream wrong?

28:09.606 --> 28:12.484
What if my dress isn't screwed up?
What if it's my veil?

28:12.568 --> 28:16.071
So I put on the veil.
Then I remember I'm serving salmon puffs.

28:16.154 --> 28:18.615
Salmon puffs. Completely wrong.

28:18.699 --> 28:21.910
So I had to rush over here
and try to find another first course.

28:21.994 --> 28:25.247
I walk out and these daffodils...
Something snapped.

28:25.330 --> 28:30.002
- And that's when you walked in here.
- Honey, you're nervous. It's natural.

28:30.085 --> 28:33.338
- I wasn't nervous until tonight.
- Well, that's okay.

28:33.422 --> 28:35.132
- I'm scared.
- I know.

28:35.174 --> 28:37.342
- I don't want to get divorced.
- I know.

28:37.426 --> 28:40.095
I don't want to fight all the time
and end up bitter.

28:40.179 --> 28:41.346
I know.

28:41.430 --> 28:44.433
I don't want to be one of those women
sitting around...

28:44.516 --> 28:46.643
making jokes about husband number two.

28:46.727 --> 28:48.937
- I want number one to last.
- I know.

28:49.021 --> 28:52.858
- I want a guarantee.
- Sookie, you're gonna be fine.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.902
I know. No, I don't.

28:54.985 --> 28:58.071
I need to stop obsessing on this.
Tell me something.

28:58.155 --> 29:00.032
- Like what?
- I don't know. Anything.

29:00.073 --> 29:03.160
Tell me something to make me
stop thinking about this.

29:03.702 --> 29:06.705
- I just slept with Christopher.
- That'll work.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.332
- It just happened.
- When?

29:08.415 --> 29:10.876
- Tonight in his room.
- Oh, my God.

29:10.959 --> 29:12.628
- Was it...
- Yeah.

29:13.170 --> 29:14.796
- What does this mean?
- I don't know.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.341
- Is this a good thing?
- I don't know. I think it is.

29:17.382 --> 29:20.636
Imagine if you and Christopher
got together after all these years.

29:20.719 --> 29:23.222
Hold on. We haven't talked
about that ourselves yet.

29:23.889 --> 29:26.058
Oh, God.

29:26.141 --> 29:28.060
- I know.
- When will you talk about it?

29:28.143 --> 29:30.395
When I go back up
with the snacks I promised.

29:30.479 --> 29:32.648
- He's waiting for you?
- Yes, he is.

29:33.482 --> 29:35.609
- You must get back.
- You need some sleep.

29:35.692 --> 29:37.778
I want to hear all the details tomorrow.

29:37.861 --> 29:41.365
I'll grab you between the walking down
the aisle and the getting married.

29:43.242 --> 29:45.035
- Hey, Sookie.
- What?

29:45.994 --> 29:48.205
You're in your wedding dress.

29:49.122 --> 29:51.542
- I am.
- You're beautiful.

30:00.259 --> 30:03.637
- Now you go get some sleep.
- And you go get some.

30:07.432 --> 30:10.727
- Room service.
- I do like this hotel.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.733
- That's good. What is it?
- I have no idea.

30:16.775 --> 30:19.236
But if Sookie asks, Michel ate it.

30:21.155 --> 30:24.825
Should we avoid the subject for a while
or dive right in?

30:24.950 --> 30:27.244
- Call me Greg Louganis.
- Right.

30:28.162 --> 30:29.955
What just happened here...

30:30.330 --> 30:32.166
- Amazing.
- I'm not arguing.

30:32.249 --> 30:35.252
Does that mean there's a chance
for a repeat amazing?

30:35.294 --> 30:37.880
Do you mean right now or in general?

30:37.963 --> 30:41.508
- Both. Let's start with in general.
- I don't know, Chris.

30:41.675 --> 30:44.011
It's weird, isn't it? I mean...

30:44.136 --> 30:46.889
we found this great balance.
I've been seeing you more.

30:46.972 --> 30:48.891
- We're getting along so well.
- I know.

30:48.974 --> 30:51.852
- And this thing with Sherry is so recent.
- I know.

30:51.935 --> 30:54.271
Then there's Rory to think about.

30:54.313 --> 30:57.149
We can't go changing everything
on her now.

30:57.858 --> 31:01.320
- Not unless...
- Not unless it's a permanent change.

31:01.361 --> 31:03.197
- Yeah.
- You're so sure it can't be?

31:03.280 --> 31:05.282
No, I'm not so sure.

31:05.324 --> 31:07.451
- The timing seems right.
- I know it does.

31:07.493 --> 31:09.620
Maybe all this stuff we went through...

31:09.661 --> 31:12.289
that's the journey we needed to take
to end up here.

31:12.372 --> 31:15.626
- Maybe.
- Being a family. Mom, Dad, kid, Volvo.

31:15.667 --> 31:19.129
- The Volvo will have to go.
- It has a nice ring to it.

31:19.505 --> 31:22.966
Yeah, it does. I guess...

31:24.051 --> 31:25.177
What?

31:27.179 --> 31:31.433
- I guess we'll never know until we try.
- So, we try?

31:31.892 --> 31:34.478
Yeah, we try.

31:42.569 --> 31:45.405
I've got ten minutes.
How fast can you make a ham on rye?

31:45.489 --> 31:47.991
- I never clocked it.
- Do you think it could be fast?

31:48.033 --> 31:49.701
Of all the sandwiches...

31:49.785 --> 31:52.704
I believe the ham on rye
is one of the faster ones to assemble.

31:52.788 --> 31:55.249
- And a patty melt? Same time frame?
- Probably longer.

31:55.332 --> 31:57.584
- Really?
- Yes, I have to grill a hamburger.

31:57.668 --> 32:00.128
With the other one,
I put the ham on the bread.

32:00.212 --> 32:02.673
What if I want the bread
on the ham on rye toasted?

32:02.756 --> 32:05.092
Somewhere between
the patty melt and the un-toasted?

32:05.175 --> 32:07.261
- Probably.
- Closer to the melt...

32:07.803 --> 32:10.848
- Peanut butter and jelly to go.
- Coming right up.

32:12.683 --> 32:15.394
- What do you think of this suit?
- It's fine.

32:15.477 --> 32:17.020
I got it for Sookie's wedding.

32:17.062 --> 32:18.689
I read an article that said...

32:18.730 --> 32:20.732
weddings are excellent places
to meet women.

32:20.774 --> 32:22.526
If it was in the paper, it must be true.

32:22.568 --> 32:26.905
I hope so, 'cause I'm so damn lonely,
not even Animal Planet does it for me.

32:27.364 --> 32:29.241
Your sandwich is coming right up.

32:29.324 --> 32:32.077
Caesar, I'm going upstairs for a minute.

32:47.092 --> 32:48.635
How did you get in here?

32:48.719 --> 32:51.096
- The door was open.
- I mean, I was in the diner.

32:51.597 --> 32:53.390
I would have seen you come up the stairs.

32:53.432 --> 32:56.393
You know what? Forget it.
I don't want to know.

32:59.104 --> 33:01.398
- So how's everything back home?
- Fine.

33:03.108 --> 33:05.152
- Your mom?
- Fine.

33:06.361 --> 33:08.363
- Are you in trouble?
- No.

33:08.822 --> 33:11.366
Then what the hell
are you doing here, Jess?

33:15.204 --> 33:19.291
You know, I called you six times.
Now, I didn't expect you to call me back...

33:19.374 --> 33:24.379
so we could sit on the phone in bed
and watch Sleepless in Seattle together.

33:24.838 --> 33:27.841
I just expected you to call me back
to say you got home safe...

33:27.925 --> 33:31.512
no one mugged you on the bus,
say you were okay.

33:33.305 --> 33:35.641
You know what? Never mind.

33:36.975 --> 33:39.603
Just tell me what it is you want.
I got work to do.

33:41.939 --> 33:44.316
- I want to come back.
- You what?

33:45.484 --> 33:47.277
I want to come back.

33:47.319 --> 33:48.821
- Come back here?
- Yes.

33:48.862 --> 33:50.447
- Here to Stars Hollow?
- Yes.

33:50.531 --> 33:53.158
- To live here with me?
- I said yes a million times.

33:53.242 --> 33:55.285
You're the one asking for something...

33:55.369 --> 33:57.830
so you don't get to be James Dean
this time, okay?

33:57.913 --> 34:00.499
One more time. You wanna come back?

34:02.459 --> 34:03.794
- Yes.
- Why?

34:07.422 --> 34:08.966
I just wanna come back.

34:12.302 --> 34:15.138
You know what people told me
when I said you were coming here?

34:15.179 --> 34:18.016
They told me I was crazy.
They told me I was insane.

34:18.100 --> 34:22.603
They told me to start writing letters
to Jodie Foster, but I ignored them.

34:22.855 --> 34:24.857
I was so sure that I knew
what I was doing...

34:24.982 --> 34:27.234
and then you showed up,
and you know what happened?

34:27.317 --> 34:29.319
You proved them right. I was crazy.

34:29.402 --> 34:34.158
And now, after all that has happened,
after all the chaos and havoc...

34:34.241 --> 34:37.077
that you have wreaked,
you're seriously standing there...

34:37.161 --> 34:41.039
wearing a T-shirt with a picture of a butt
with hands that are flipping me off...

34:41.081 --> 34:43.000
telling me you want to come back?

34:48.045 --> 34:51.884
- You didn't pack up my stuff yet.
- No, I've been a little busy.

34:51.967 --> 34:54.136
When were you planning on sending it
back to me?

34:54.219 --> 34:57.389
Am I wearing a little brown uniform
with UPS stamped on it?

34:59.558 --> 35:02.686
So what do you think?

35:06.481 --> 35:09.151
Things are gonna
have to be different, Jess.

35:09.318 --> 35:10.611
I know.

35:12.905 --> 35:15.032
- Okay.
- Okay?

35:17.075 --> 35:18.869
- So you're staying?
- I'm staying.

35:19.620 --> 35:22.998
Okay then, stay.

35:24.583 --> 35:27.002
I got to get back to the diner.

35:27.586 --> 35:30.631
I'll help you close up later, all right?

35:32.674 --> 35:34.009
Sure.

35:37.721 --> 35:39.223
She's not home.

35:41.266 --> 35:43.602
- Who?
- She's at Sookie's wedding with Dean.

35:43.644 --> 35:44.645
They're still together.

35:44.728 --> 35:47.523
They seem to have gotten through
the whole car incident.

35:47.606 --> 35:50.317
They're doing really good, Dean and Rory.

35:51.318 --> 35:52.653
Good.

35:53.320 --> 35:54.780
Just leave it alone, Jess.

35:54.988 --> 35:57.491
She's got a boyfriend. Just let it go.

35:57.574 --> 36:00.828
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm just going out for a walk.

36:00.911 --> 36:04.164
- You heard what I said?
- Yeah, I heard what you said.

36:14.967 --> 36:18.220
The linen closet's the third door
on the right.

36:19.513 --> 36:22.349
I know just what's the matter

36:22.432 --> 36:24.852
Because I've been there once or twice

36:24.935 --> 36:27.271
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you look nice.

36:27.312 --> 36:29.314
Thank you. You look beautiful.

36:29.356 --> 36:32.734
- Thank you.
- So how many cocktails caused that?

36:32.818 --> 36:34.528
They haven't had any cocktails yet.

36:34.611 --> 36:35.654
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

36:35.737 --> 36:37.990
When they start having cocktails,
we'll hide you.

36:38.031 --> 36:39.658
I'm looking forward to that.

36:40.909 --> 36:43.453
I'm not sure who'd be calling me now.

36:44.204 --> 36:45.205
- Hello?
- Dean?

36:45.289 --> 36:47.666
- Who is this?
- It's Paris. I need to talk to Rory.

36:48.292 --> 36:52.087
- Sure, hold on. It's Paris.
- What?

36:53.338 --> 36:55.340
- Hello?
- We got the band.

36:56.425 --> 36:59.219
I knew we had most
of the academic clubs tied up, but band...

36:59.303 --> 37:00.345
they were the wildcard.

37:00.429 --> 37:02.598
If anybody's going to be
truly scared of me...

37:02.681 --> 37:04.766
it's some artsy loser with a tuba.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.268
How did you get this number?

37:06.351 --> 37:09.188
I won't call you
on Prince William's precious phone again.

37:09.271 --> 37:13.025
I just wanted you to know that we did it.
We're in. Welcome to the show.

37:16.195 --> 37:18.238
I think we won.

37:18.322 --> 37:21.825
- Wow. That's great.
- Yeah.

37:22.159 --> 37:25.037
I guess this means you'll be spending
the summer in Washington.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.288
Nothing's decided yet.

37:26.371 --> 37:29.917
Believe me. Let me do a little research,
then I'll figure something out.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.084
Good.

37:33.337 --> 37:35.589
You know what's really great
about being a grownup?

37:35.672 --> 37:38.091
- This.
- Well, thanks for the life lesson.

37:38.175 --> 37:40.177
You're welcome.
You clean up really nicely.

37:40.219 --> 37:41.220
Thank you.

37:41.303 --> 37:44.223
We have to hide him from Patty
and Babbette when they're drunk.

37:44.264 --> 37:47.184
- I already told him.
- I got to check on some things.

37:47.226 --> 37:48.810
- See you guys later.
- Bye.

37:51.522 --> 37:53.148
- Stop it.
- Stop what?

37:53.607 --> 37:57.194
Stop looking at me like that,
or everyone here will think we did it.

37:59.988 --> 38:01.740
That'll throw them off the track.

38:01.824 --> 38:05.744
So this morning you woke up
and felt sorry about last night?

38:05.828 --> 38:06.829
No.

38:06.995 --> 38:09.540
- Embarrassed about last night?
- No.

38:09.581 --> 38:11.917
Eager and willing to repeat last night?

38:13.043 --> 38:15.546
- Mom, Dad, hi.
- Richard, Emily.

38:15.587 --> 38:18.131
Hello, Christopher.
What a pleasant surprise.

38:19.049 --> 38:21.426
- You came.
- Of course we came. We were invited.

38:21.468 --> 38:24.221
Hello, Christopher.
Why did you think we would not come?

38:24.263 --> 38:26.557
- You thought the invitation was rude.
- It was rude.

38:26.598 --> 38:29.101
It would have been equally rude
for us not to attend...

38:29.142 --> 38:31.603
when we were perfectly capable
of doing so, so we came.

38:31.687 --> 38:33.272
That's called 'rising above it. '

38:33.355 --> 38:36.066
I see. You wanna come here long enough
to get a drink?

38:36.108 --> 38:37.234
That would be nice.

38:37.276 --> 38:39.153
- I'll get it for you.
- Champagne, please.

38:39.236 --> 38:40.779
- Should I make that two?
- Absolutely.

38:40.863 --> 38:44.575
I believe I'll join you to see
what sort of scotch they're serving here.

38:44.616 --> 38:48.579
When I get back, you're gonna
have to answer my last question.

38:51.456 --> 38:53.542
What on earth is Christopher doing here?

38:54.376 --> 38:56.420
Well, he's visiting his daughter.

38:56.670 --> 38:58.130
- That's very nice.
- Yeah.

38:59.006 --> 39:01.466
He's been visiting his daughter
quite a bit lately.

39:01.508 --> 39:02.718
- Really?
- Yes.

39:02.968 --> 39:06.555
You might be seeing a lot more
of Christopher from now on.

39:06.889 --> 39:09.016
Because he'll be visiting his daughter?

39:09.433 --> 39:12.311
Yes. He'll be visiting his daughter.

39:14.813 --> 39:16.565
Well, I'll be damned.

39:16.815 --> 39:19.234
I go out walking

39:19.318 --> 39:21.195
After midnight

39:21.278 --> 39:23.447
Out in the moonlight

39:23.489 --> 39:25.616
Just like we used to do

39:25.657 --> 39:27.743
I'm always walking

39:27.826 --> 39:29.286
After midnight

39:29.369 --> 39:32.206
Searching for you

39:32.789 --> 39:34.500
So I'm guessing your mom talked to you.

39:34.583 --> 39:37.836
She talks to me all the time,
frequently when I'm begging her not to.

39:37.878 --> 39:41.715
- And she told you what we discussed?
- She mentioned something about it, yes.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.384
- And what do you think about all this?
- I don't know.

39:44.468 --> 39:47.262
- What exactly are your intentions?
- Excuse me?

39:47.346 --> 39:49.264
Your intentions, are they honorable?

39:49.890 --> 39:51.391
Completely honorable.

39:51.475 --> 39:54.353
We have been waiting for this
for a really long time...

39:54.394 --> 39:57.022
and we take disappointment
extremely hard.

39:57.105 --> 39:59.191
I mean it.
Property damage is often involved.

39:59.274 --> 40:01.193
I better follow through on this, huh?

40:01.235 --> 40:03.111
I think that's an excellent idea.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.780
Come here, you.

40:07.074 --> 40:08.951
- That's probably work.
- On a Sunday?

40:09.034 --> 40:11.578
Hey, I've got a lot of responsibility
now, okay?

40:12.204 --> 40:13.497
Be right back.

40:24.758 --> 40:26.218
What are you doing here?

40:26.301 --> 40:28.679
- Hello to you, too.
- Is everything okay?

40:28.887 --> 40:30.514
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

40:31.265 --> 40:33.433
- What are you doing here?
- I moved back.

40:34.142 --> 40:36.395
- What?
- I moved back.

40:36.436 --> 40:38.856
But why?

40:39.273 --> 40:41.358
I just wanted to.

40:49.408 --> 40:51.118
Oh, my God.

40:52.411 --> 40:54.663
- Rory...
- Don't say a word.

40:55.289 --> 40:56.832
- Okay.
- I have to go.

40:58.709 --> 41:00.002
Welcome home.

41:04.381 --> 41:06.508
- Lor.
- Hey, there.

41:06.592 --> 41:08.844
We're starting any minute.
Have you seen Rory?

41:08.927 --> 41:11.972
- Yeah, I just left her over there.
- Okay, I'll find her.

41:12.055 --> 41:15.058
Get a good seat. The wind's kicking up
so this may be a good show.

41:15.142 --> 41:16.393
I have to go.

41:17.561 --> 41:20.314
- What? Why?
- I have to take care of something.

41:20.397 --> 41:21.815
- Chris.
- I'm sorry, really.

41:21.899 --> 41:25.110
- I'll call you later to see how it went.
- No, wait a minute.

41:25.360 --> 41:28.864
Tell me why you're leaving.
What's going on?

41:30.491 --> 41:32.493
Sherry called. She's back.

41:33.285 --> 41:34.828
So you're going home.

41:35.454 --> 41:37.873
Gonna tell her you're moving out?

41:41.251 --> 41:42.503
No?

41:43.629 --> 41:45.047
- Okay.
- I can't believe this.

41:45.130 --> 41:47.925
I mean, I really can't believe this.

41:48.592 --> 41:51.929
Okay. I don't know. Just drive safe.

41:52.387 --> 41:54.056
- Drive safe?
- Yeah, drive safe.

41:54.139 --> 41:57.935
I mean, you're still Rory's dad, right?

41:57.976 --> 42:00.229
Whatever happens
or doesn't happen between us...

42:00.312 --> 42:01.647
I still need you to drive safe.

42:01.688 --> 42:02.773
- Lorelai...
- Just go, Chris.

42:02.814 --> 42:04.149
Sherry's pregnant.

42:06.819 --> 42:08.320
Oh, my.

42:08.821 --> 42:11.990
She just found out and she called me
as soon as she found out.

42:12.074 --> 42:15.661
And that was her calling to tell me
that she found out.

42:17.454 --> 42:19.456
- Pregnant?
- Yeah.

42:21.834 --> 42:26.547
Well, women all over the world
will line up to see that tiny woman fat.

42:26.630 --> 42:28.882
I don't know what to do.
I was so happy last night.

42:28.966 --> 42:30.717
- And now...
- Yeah.

42:31.510 --> 42:34.638
I missed it before with Rory.
I wasn't there. I wasn't a part of it.

42:34.721 --> 42:37.266
- I know.
- And I never forgave myself.

42:37.432 --> 42:39.226
- I know.
- So I'm gonna do that again?

42:39.309 --> 42:42.604
- I'm just gonna take off? Disappear?
- No.

42:44.273 --> 42:47.401
- You're gonna go home.
- This is absolutely unbelievable.

42:47.484 --> 42:49.194
I waited years for this, Lor:

42:49.278 --> 42:51.822
You, Rory, the whole perfect picture.

42:53.907 --> 42:57.119
I have to walk down the aisle in a minute
and be happy for Sookie...

42:57.202 --> 42:59.538
and right now
I'm having a little trouble standing.

42:59.621 --> 43:03.584
So maybe it would be better
if you would just go.

43:05.586 --> 43:06.879
I'm so sorry.

43:07.462 --> 43:09.006
Yeah, me, too.

43:10.674 --> 43:12.968
- Tell Rory?
- I will.

43:23.896 --> 43:26.481
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

43:52.925 --> 43:55.177
I think I'm going to Washington.

43:57.179 --> 43:58.472
Okay.
