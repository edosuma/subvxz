02:14.068 --> 02:17.068
TAKEDOWN-- MASTER OF TAKEDOWN

02:17.103 --> 02:20.931
EVICTION.
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "CELEBRITY

02:20.965 --> 02:34.000
BIG BROTHER."
LET THE WAR BEGIN.

02:34.034 --> 02:39.931
YOU GUYS KILLED IT.
SEE THIS RIGHT HERE, THAT IS

02:39.965 --> 02:42.793
THE H.O.H., I CAME INTO THIS
HOUSE THINKING OF BEING AN

02:42.827 --> 02:45.965
ATHLETE, MAYBE IT IS BETTER TO
LAY LOW, BUT I COULDN'T HELP

02:46.000 --> 02:48.862
MYSELF.
I DON'T HAVE A CLEAR CUT GAME

02:48.896 --> 02:52.068
PLAN ON HOW I'M GETTING FROM
HERE TO THE FINISH LINE.

02:52.103 --> 02:55.068
BUT I WON THE FIRST RACE.
WHEN YOU GUYS GET TO THE

02:55.103 --> 02:58.137
SMART ONE, THAT IS THE ONE WHERE
I WILL BE LIKE, IN THE DUST.

02:58.172 --> 03:01.551
LOOK AT THIS MESS WE ALL MADE
HERE.

03:01.586 --> 03:05.965
MIESHA TATE WINS HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD, BEING O-- H.O.H. IS

03:06.000 --> 03:09.241
EVERYTHING.
YOU HOLD ALL THE CARS

03:09.275 --> 03:12.034
SHALL-- CARDS, HAVE I TO STAY IN
MIESHA'S GOOD GRACES.

03:12.068 --> 03:14.000
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS
BOX THING.

03:14.034 --> 03:17.655
THERE IT IS.
I LOVE GIFTS, ANY KIND OF

03:17.689 --> 03:20.793
GIFTS, BIRTHDAY, CHRISTMAS,
ANNIVERSARY.

03:20.827 --> 03:26.379
BUT I HAVE TO SAY, A GIFT THAT
COULD BE A BLESSING AND A CURSE,

03:26.413 --> 03:29.586
I MAY NEED TO GET A RECEIPT FOR
THAT ONE, MAKE SURE I CAN RETURN

03:29.620 --> 03:32.862
IT.
OH MY GOD, I MIGHT BE UP

03:32.896 --> 03:34.448
LATER.
YOU'RE WELCOME TO IT.

03:34.482 --> 03:43.551
WHAT IS MINE IS YOURS, MI CASA
IS SU CASA.

03:43.586 --> 03:46.000
THIS IS WILD, YOU CAN BELIEVE
WE ARE DOING THERE.

03:46.034 --> 03:49.551
I WAS THINKING THAT, LOOKING
DOWN THIS IS CRAZY.

03:49.586 --> 03:52.034
I NEED TO USE THIS WEEK TO
SET MYSELF UP IN THE GAME AS

03:52.068 --> 03:55.344
BEST AS POSSIBLE.
SO I NEED TO START BUILDING MY

03:55.379 --> 03:56.551
ALLIANCE.
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT

03:56.586 --> 04:00.172
YOU ARE GOING TO DO?
THE THING IS I FEEL LIKE I

04:00.206 --> 04:04.758
KIND OF WANT THE MORE ATHLETIC
PEOPLE TO STICK TOGETHER A

04:04.793 --> 04:11.517
LITTLE BIT AT FIRST.
IT WOULD BE ME AND YOU.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.931
WHEN I CAME INTO THIS HOUSE I
WAS FULLY PREPARED FOR NO ONE TO

04:14.965 --> 04:17.310
OFFER ME AN ALLIANCE.
BUT NOW OUT OF NOWHERE MIESHA

04:17.344 --> 04:19.034
WANTS TO BE IN AN ALLIANCE WITH
ME.

04:19.068 --> 04:24.482
SO I AM ALREADY IN AN ALLIANCE
WITH CARSON, SHANNA AND CYNTHIA.

04:24.517 --> 04:28.206
I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS THIS
OUTFIT OR CUTE HAT I WORE INTO

04:28.241 --> 04:30.448
THIS HOUSE BUT IT IS RAINING
ALLIANCES.

04:30.482 --> 04:33.310
I KNOW IT'S EARLY IN THIS
GAME TO NAKE PROMISES BUT MY

04:33.344 --> 04:37.034
HEART FEELS LIKE WE WITH MAKE A
GREAT FINAL TWO, DO YOU KNOW

04:37.068 --> 04:40.482
WHAT I MEAN.
I FEEL LIKE I JUST GOT ASKED

04:40.517 --> 04:44.862
ON A DATE.
LAMAR, WHERE ARE YOU GOING.

04:44.896 --> 04:47.517
COME.
SO WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT I

04:47.551 --> 04:50.241
GAME PLAN OR STRATEGY AND
EVERYTHING.

04:50.275 --> 04:55.724
AND I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE IF
THE ATHLETES HAVE ANY HOPE OF

04:55.758 --> 04:58.275
MAKING IT FURTHER IN THE GAME WE
HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER AT FIRST

04:58.310 --> 05:02.827
BECAUSE WE ARE ALL GOING TO HAVE
A TARGET ON OUR BACK, RIGHT?

05:02.862 --> 05:05.482
YEAH.
AND I GET A FIST BUMP FROM

05:05.517 --> 05:09.482
LAMAR ODOM SAYING HE WANTS TO
WORK WITH ME.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.862
THANK YOU, LAMAR.
LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

05:11.896 --> 05:22.344
THAT MAKES SENSE.
FIRST DAY.

05:22.379 --> 05:28.379
YOU DON'T WANT TO PLAY HARD, BUT
YOU GET TOGETHER AND SAY US TWO.

05:28.413 --> 05:32.517
AND THEN CHRIS KIRKPATRICK
ASKED ME TO BE A PART OF

05:32.551 --> 05:38.000
SOMETHING HE HAS GOING ON.
IT WAS LIKE WE WERE IN SYNC OR

05:38.034 --> 05:46.586
SOMETHING, SO YES, I WILL.
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

05:46.620 --> 05:48.724
SOMEBODY.
DEFINITELY SOMETHING SOMEBODY

05:48.758 --> 05:51.551
I WANT TO WORK WITH, WE HAVE
MUTUAL FRIENDS, KIND OF IN THE

05:51.586 --> 05:54.172
SAME COUNTRY AND REMINDED ME A
LOT OF ME WHEN I WAS YOUNG.

05:54.206 --> 05:59.758
HE DEFINITELY SEEMS VERY TRUST
WORTHY AT LEAST FOR NOW.

05:59.793 --> 06:11.620
LIKE IT IS A BIG ISSUE.
YOU GUY ALREADY HAVE

06:11.655 --> 06:21.965
ALLIANCES IN HERE?
WE DON'T.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.103
I REALLY LIKE.
ME TOO.

06:30.137 --> 06:38.931
THEN GI INTO THE BATHROOM AND
MIRAI IS WTH TEDDI AND THEY

06:38.965 --> 06:46.655
ASKED ME AND I WAS LIKE I THINK
I WILL.

06:46.689 --> 06:58.241
I ALMOST INJURED MYSELF IN
THIS POWER ROOM.

06:58.275 --> 07:08.862
RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN AN ALLIANCE
AND-- I THINK-- PEOPLE HAVE TO

07:08.896 --> 07:13.655
ARE PROTECT EACH OTHER AND I
FEEL LIKE-- GIVING ME GOOD

07:13.689 --> 07:16.310
VIBES.
I'M ALREADY WORKING WITH

07:16.344 --> 07:21.689
TODRICK AND TEDDI, THREE MORE
MIGHT BE THE RIGHT NUMBER.

07:21.724 --> 07:25.000
DO YOU HAVE OTHER ALLIANCES
ALREADY?

07:25.034 --> 07:35.827
I KIND OF FELL INTO ONE RIGHT
A WAY WITH SHANNA.

07:35.862 --> 07:45.689
THEN MAYBE TEDDI AND I COULD
JOIN.

07:45.724 --> 07:54.103
>>-- CYNTHIA, TODRICK, CARSON,
TEDDI, THAT IS ALREADY A

07:54.137 --> 07:56.724
MAJORITY SO THAT IS GOOD.
TO BE HONEST I'M A LITTLE

07:56.758 --> 07:59.241
SURPRISED THAT I'M SO POPULAR IN
THESE ALLIANCES.

07:59.275 --> 08:01.275
HOW IS IT GOING?
GOOD.

08:01.310 --> 08:05.551
I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING THAT
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO PULL ME IN.

08:05.586 --> 08:10.206
I THINK WE HAVE CARSON
AND-- THEY ALREADY TALKED ABOUT

08:10.241 --> 08:14.689
IT, THAT IS A MAJORITY.
I TOLD MYSELF I WASN'T GOING

08:14.724 --> 08:18.448
TO RUSH INTO AN ALLIANCE.
ALSO SAID I WAS GOING TO TRUST

08:18.482 --> 08:22.034
MY GUT.
AND I'M FEELING GOOD WITH THESE

08:22.068 --> 08:25.655
PEOPLE.
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.

08:25.689 --> 08:29.034
IT IS AN ALLIANCE I WILL BE
TRUE TO.

08:29.068 --> 08:31.965
IT HAS NOT ONLY BEEN 24
HOURS, YOU GUYS AND I'M ALREADY

08:32.000 --> 08:38.034
WORKING WITH CARSON, CYNTHIA,
SHANNA, MIRAI, TEDDI, CHRIS

08:38.068 --> 08:41.137
KIRKPATRICK, MIESHA, LAMAR AND
THE ONLY REASON I'M NOT IN AN

08:41.172 --> 08:44.103
ALLIANCE WITH CHRIS KATTAN IS
BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN A LEAP

08:44.137 --> 08:48.034
THE WHOLE TIME WE'VE BEEN HERE.
THAT IS SO DULL.

08:48.068 --> 08:48.620
YEAH.

08:59.448 --> 09:02.344
OH MY GOD.
QUICK CHANGE.

09:02.379 --> 09:06.137
SO I'M ABSOLUTELY LOVING THIS
APPLIANCE.

09:06.172 --> 09:09.862
WE'VE GOT KARGSON, CYNTHIA,
TODRICK, MYSELF AND WE JUST

09:09.896 --> 09:13.517
BROUGHT IN MIRAI AND TEDDI.
AND I AM SO EXCITED.

09:13.551 --> 09:15.758
TODRICK.
YES, MA'AM.

09:15.793 --> 09:18.931
YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH AN
ALLIANCE NAME.

09:18.965 --> 09:20.862
THAT'S CUTE.
YEAH.

09:20.896 --> 09:23.931
WE DO THAT?
WE'RE TRYING TO THINK OF A

09:23.965 --> 09:25.896
NAME.
EVERYONE HAS AN ALLIANCE

09:25.931 --> 09:27.793
NAME.
WHAT SHOULD THE NAME BE.

09:27.827 --> 09:31.034
AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN IT
IT COMES TO ME, HOW ABOUT

09:31.068 --> 09:32.344
FORMATION.
OH MY GOD.

09:32.379 --> 09:35.862
I LOVE THAT.
LET'S GET IN FORMATION.

09:35.896 --> 09:41.034
I HOPE IT'S NOT COPYWRIT.
I LOVE THAT.

09:41.068 --> 09:43.000
DONE.
SO I'M WORKING WITH FORMATION

09:43.034 --> 09:47.000
BUT I ALSO REALLY, REALLY LIKE
MIESHA AND WE ARE STARTING TO

09:47.034 --> 09:49.965
FORM SOMETHING.
FUN FACT I HAVE KNOWN HOW TO

09:50.000 --> 09:53.344
JUGGLE MY ENTIRE LIFE BUT IN
THIS SITUATION, I DON'T KNOW HOW

09:53.379 --> 09:55.206
I AM GOING TO JUGGLE ALL OF
THIS.

09:55.241 --> 09:58.482
COME ON FORMATION, COME ON
FORMATION.

09:58.517 --> 10:03.724
HASHTAG FORMATION.
THE FORMATION IS THE NAME AND

10:03.758 --> 10:05.862
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER" IS THE
GAME, WE HAVE THE NUMBERS, WE

10:05.896 --> 10:09.655
ARE SIX STRONG, ST TIME TO GET
TO WORK.

10:09.689 --> 10:31.068
COME ON FORMATION STATION,
LIBERATION

10:31.103 --> 10:44.344
I'M SLEEPING AND I HEAR WHAT

10:44.379 --> 10:51.241
SOUNDS LIKE A DYING WHALE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE IS

10:51.275 --> 10:57.620
SHOVING THEIR ARM DOWN THE
THROAT OF A PERSON.

10:57.655 --> 11:08.586
AND JUST SLOWLY PULLING THE
INSIDES OUT.

11:08.620 --> 11:17.931
OH NO, NO, NO, IT'S JUST TODD.
I DON'T HOLD THE SNORING

11:17.965 --> 11:22.965
AGAINST HIM BUT HIS SNORING
SOUNDS LIKE, YOU KNOW, TWO

11:23.000 --> 11:46.896
ELEPHANTS ARE GIVING BIRTH AT
THE SAME TIME.

11:46.931 --> 11:51.137
WHAT DOES YOUR TATTOO SAY.

11:51.172 --> 11:53.413
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE, I ALMOST
PASSED OUT.

11:53.448 --> 11:56.620
ON YOUR CHEST, THEY SAY THAT
IS NATURALLY.

11:56.655 --> 12:01.137
I DON'T KNOW,-- CAN-- GNARLY.
I DON'T KNOW BRO.

12:01.172 --> 12:07.655
WHAT IS THAT.
IT IS A-- THAT IS THE-- I'VE

12:07.689 --> 12:09.724
EVER SEEN.
SO I WAS DRUNK AS HELL WHEN I

12:09.758 --> 12:11.482
GOT THIS ONE.
I WAS DRUNK.

12:11.517 --> 12:17.000
WERE YOU LIKE GIVE ME A
SUPERHERO WITH A MINI HEAD.

12:17.034 --> 12:20.689
THE MORE YOU LOOK AT IT THE
FUNNIER IT GETS.

12:20.724 --> 12:27.379
OH MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.896
EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT JUST
MAKES ME LAUGH.

12:29.931 --> 12:34.482
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE SEEN
MY EX'S, I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF

12:34.517 --> 12:39.034
TATTOOS, HE BETTER NEVER, EVER
COVER THAT TA TATTOO UP, I WILL

12:39.068 --> 12:42.482
BE HEART BROCKEN.
MI GOING TO CRY LAUGHING.

12:42.517 --> 12:45.310
WHO PICKED IT.
I THINK I DID WHEN I WAS

12:45.344 --> 12:49.896
DRUNK, OKAY.
OH MY GOD.

12:49.931 --> 12:52.172
WHAT'S UP, BRO.
YOU ALL RIGHT?

12:52.206 --> 12:53.689
YEAH, HOW ARE YOU.
WOULD YOU EVER THOUGHT WE

12:53.724 --> 12:55.379
WERE GOING TO HIT IT OFF LIKE
THIS.

12:55.413 --> 13:02.965
I HAD NO IDEA WHO WAS GOING
TO BE IN HERE.

13:03.000 --> 13:14.344
I WAS HOPING MY EX-WIFE.
I WANTED TO SEE HER SO BAD,

13:14.379 --> 13:18.931
BRO.
I WOULD FEEL COMPLETE WITH

13:18.965 --> 13:25.448
ANOTHER SHOT.
I TOOK A VOW UNDER THE LORD'S

13:25.482 --> 13:29.241
EYE, YOU EXPECT TO THON OR THAT
VOW, WHICH I DIDN'T.

13:29.275 --> 13:33.517
AND IT KIND OF HAUNTS ME AND NOW
THAT I DIDN'T, SOMETIMES WHEN I

13:33.551 --> 13:36.344
GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK
ABOUT IT, IT IS THERAPEUTIC A

13:36.379 --> 13:38.965
LITTLE BIT.
AND DO I MISS HER AND HER FAMILY

13:39.000 --> 13:42.655
DEARLY, EVEN JUST HER FAMILY I'M
SORRY I LET THEM DOWN.

13:42.689 --> 13:47.482
THEY HAD SO MUCH FAITH IN ME,
GAVE ME MY OWN NICKNAME, LAMY, I

13:47.517 --> 13:51.379
WOULD DO ANYTHING TO MAKE IT UP.
WHAT THE HELL DID I THINK I

13:51.413 --> 13:54.275
WOULD GET AWAY WITH THAT.
I DON'T KNOW.

13:54.310 --> 13:56.379
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP TALK.
DO YOU THINK SHE WAS THE ONE.

13:56.413 --> 13:59.689
I THINK SO, WE GOT MARRIED IN
30 DAYS.

13:59.724 --> 14:02.655
KNEW EACH OTHER 30 DAYS.
OH WOW.

14:02.689 --> 14:05.517
HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET, DID I
MISS THAT PART.

14:05.551 --> 14:10.000
WE MET AT A WELCOME TO L.A.
PARTY.

14:10.034 --> 14:15.275
AND THEN AFTER THAT, EVERYTHING
WAS JUST NATURAL, I WAS WITH HER

14:15.310 --> 14:19.344
EVERY DAY UNTIL WE GOT MARRIED.
THAT'S AMAZING.

14:19.379 --> 14:22.275
I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO HAVING CHILDREN WITH HER.

14:22.310 --> 14:27.655
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HAVE, LIKE,
THEY DON'T KNOW, LIKE YOU, YOU

14:27.689 --> 14:29.448
KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
THEY READ THINGS, THEY SEE

14:29.482 --> 14:31.517
THINGS.
BUT I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE

14:31.551 --> 14:35.482
COOL BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO
GET TO SEE THE FUN, COOL SIDE OF

14:35.517 --> 14:37.344
YOU, YOU KNOW.
AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.

14:37.379 --> 14:40.827
I THINK LAMAR IS REALLY COOL.
I THINK HE REALLY HAS A GOOD

14:40.862 --> 14:42.689
HEART.
AND I THINK HE WANTS TO BE A

14:42.724 --> 14:46.931
BETTER MAN AND A BETTER PERSON.
AND REALLY LEARN AND GROW FROM

14:46.965 --> 14:49.000
HIS PAST EXPERIENCES.
AND I THINK THAT'S AWESOME.

14:49.034 --> 14:52.931
I JUST WANT TO TAKE HER OUT
TO EAT AND TELL HER SORRY.

14:52.965 --> 14:55.103
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT CAN
HAPPEN, YOU KNOW MUCH LIFE'S

14:55.137 --> 14:56.620
FUNNY.
BUT LOOK AT YOU.

14:56.655 --> 14:58.931
YOU ARE HERE.
I AM HERE.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.965
YOU ARE STILL STANDING.
THIS IS THE NEXT CHAPTER.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.931
THIS IS THE REBIRTH, ARE YOU
GOING TO COME OUT OF HERE LIKE

15:04.965 --> 15:18.413
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.
I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT I AM

15:18.448 --> 15:21.241
SURE.
BEING THE FIRST H.O.H. IS

15:21.275 --> 15:26.586
TOUGH, SO I NEED TO TRY TO GET
AS MANY NUMBERS ON MY SIDE AS

15:26.620 --> 15:30.275
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
I WOULD SIT BACK AND THINK

15:30.310 --> 15:34.206
ABOUT GETTING YOUR GROUP
TOGETHER.

15:34.241 --> 15:36.448
GETTING THE PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW
WOULD HAVE YOUR BACK.

15:36.482 --> 15:44.344
WOULD YOU HAVE MY BACK.
DO YOU WANT TO BE IN THE

15:44.379 --> 15:48.517
ALLIANCE.
I MEAN YEAH.

15:48.551 --> 16:04.103
WE-- WE HAVE AN ALLIANCE--
SHOULD YOU GO TO YOUR

16:04.137 --> 16:05.103
ROOM?
YEAH.

16:05.137 --> 16:13.793
GO UPSTAIRS?
OKAY, I'M NOT SURE WHAT I

16:13.827 --> 16:18.448
WILL ROLL WITH YOU, MIESHA, ALL
RIGHT, WE'RE HERE, THIS IS THE

16:18.482 --> 16:20.448
NEW ALLIANCE, FOCUS ON THIS, GOT
IT.

16:20.482 --> 16:23.206
YOU COULD MAKE THIS REALLY
SAFE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

16:23.241 --> 16:26.172
BECAUSE IF YOU PUT UP PEOPLE
THAT YOU CAN TELL THEY'RE REALLY

16:26.206 --> 16:29.103
NOT HERE TO PLAY THE GAME THAT
WELL, YOU KNOW, AND THEY JUST

16:29.137 --> 16:31.586
KIND OF WANT TO, YOU KNOW, FLOAT
THROUGH.

16:31.620 --> 16:35.551
I MEAN CHRIS OBVIOUSLY.
CHRIS DOES KEEP ME SAFE IN

16:35.586 --> 16:38.482
THE SENSE.
HE'S A SAFETY VAL OF.

16:38.517 --> 16:43.448
NOBODY IS GOING TO COME AFTER
YOU.

16:43.482 --> 16:51.172
WHO DO YOU WANT TO GO.

16:51.206 --> 16:56.241
I WAS THINK BEING TEDDI.
OH, TEDDI.

16:56.275 --> 17:01.000
SHE SAYS THINGS ABOUT THE GAME.
AND I THINK REALLY HAS THE

17:01.034 --> 17:03.655
POTENTIAL TO DO WELL IN THIS
GAME LIKE WIN SO SHE IS KIND OF

17:03.689 --> 17:08.827
LIKE THE BALANCE OF LIKE A
PRETTY DECENT THREAT BUT ALSO A

17:08.862 --> 17:12.448
STRATEGIST AND MOST LIKELY TO
BACK DOOR ME.

17:12.482 --> 17:17.103
IT IS REASSURING THAT TODRICK
AND CHRIS KIRKPATRICK SEE TEDDI

17:17.137 --> 17:20.413
AS A THREAT.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE MY H.O.H. IS

17:20.448 --> 17:24.241
NOT WASTED AND TEDDI MIGHT BE
THE PERFECT TARGET.

17:38.482 --> 17:43.034
HEY, EVERYBODY, GATHER IN THE
LIVING ROOM.

17:43.068 --> 17:46.275
IT IS TIME TO OPEN THE GALA
GIFTS BUT FIRST "BIG BROTHER"

17:46.310 --> 17:56.862
HAS A MESSAGE FOR US.
IS LEGENDARY BIG BROTHER FASHION

17:56.896 --> 18:05.379
DESIGNER, THE CREATOR OF ICONIC
BIG BROTHER ENSEMBLES HAS NOW

18:05.413 --> 18:11.137
CRAFTED HIS MASTER-- SO HOT, SO
INCREDIBLE, THAT WHOEVER

18:11.172 --> 18:16.620
POSSESSES IT, WILL BE
UNTOUCHABLE.

18:16.655 --> 18:24.034
PREPARE YOURSELVES T IS NOW TIME
TO REVEAL THE GALA GIFTS,

18:24.068 --> 18:32.137
FASHION AND LIFE WILL NEVER BE
THE SAME AGAIN.

18:32.172 --> 18:36.310
YAY.
I LOVE THE GALA GIFTS.

18:36.344 --> 18:39.931
SO AFTER THE FIRST H.O.H.
COMPETITION JULIE CHEN GIVES US

18:39.965 --> 18:43.655
THE GALA GIFT BOX BUT SHE SAYS
IT COMES WITH A BLESSING AND A

18:43.689 --> 18:46.896
CURSE.
SO I AM ALL ABOUT FANCY PRESENTS

18:46.931 --> 18:49.172
BUT IN "BIG BROTHER" A TWIST IN
THE GAME COULD BE ANYTHING.

18:49.206 --> 18:57.758
WHAT IT MEANS FOR ME IS NO ONE
IS SAFE.

18:57.793 --> 19:02.034
A BAG.
DON'T YOU GUYS KNOW BAGS ARE

19:02.068 --> 19:06.172
THE NEW HATS.
BEFORE YOU IS THE LATEST

19:06.206 --> 19:11.241
HAUTE COUTURE FROM THE LEGENDARY
DESIGNER, NOT ONLY WILL THIS IN

19:11.275 --> 19:16.517
VOGUE HAT KEEP YOU SAFE FROM A
FASHION FAUX PAS BUT IT WILL

19:16.551 --> 19:19.241
ALSO KEEP YOU SAFE FROM BEING
THE FIRST EVICTED.

19:19.275 --> 19:22.758
SO WHO WILL BE WEARING THIS
ICONIC PIECE OF HEAD WEAR?

19:22.793 --> 19:25.344
WELL, THAT'S UP FOR US TO
DECIDE.

19:25.379 --> 19:29.758
I WILL BEGIN BY CHOOSING WHICH
HOUSEGUEST TO GIVE THE HAT TO.

19:29.793 --> 19:36.689
BUT BY GIVING SOMEONE THE HAT,
I'M ALSO DECIDING THEY WILL NOT

19:36.724 --> 19:41.034
BE EARNING SAFETY.
THAT'S BECAUSE ONE BY ONE WE

19:41.068 --> 19:45.206
WILL PASS THE HAT TO EVERYONE IN
THE HOUSE AND ONLY THE LAST

19:45.241 --> 19:49.965
PERSON TO RECEIVE IT WILL BE THE
ONE WHO WILL BE SAFE FOR THIS

19:50.000 --> 19:54.275
WEEK.
SO WHO WILL BE FASHION FORWARDED

19:54.310 --> 19:56.137
STRAIGHT PAST THE FIRST
EVICTION.

19:56.172 --> 20:01.827
TIME TO FIND OUT.
SO EVERYBODY IS SUPER EXCITED

20:01.862 --> 20:06.413
ABOUT THIS LIMITED EDITION HAT
BUT UNLIKE SO MANY FASHION ITEMS

20:06.448 --> 20:09.793
THAT ARE HOT AND TRENDY, YOU
WANT TO BE THE LAST PERSON TO

20:09.827 --> 20:13.620
WEAR THIS HAT.
THE FINAL RECIPIENT OF THE HAT

20:13.655 --> 20:24.137
IS NOT ONLY ON TREND BUT THEY'RE
SAFE FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK I NEED

20:24.172 --> 20:27.034
TO MAKE SURE THAT TED TY DOES
NOT END UP WITH THIS HAT ON HER

20:27.068 --> 20:33.103
HEAD.
I CAN'T CHOOSE TEDDI DIRECTLY

20:33.137 --> 20:38.172
MYSELF OTHER I THINK SHE WILL
KNOW I'M COMING FOR HER SO I

20:38.206 --> 20:41.551
WILL GIVE THE HAT TO SOMEBODY
WHO I IS ON THE PLAN.

20:41.586 --> 20:54.137
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK, YOU ARE MY
FIRST-- OKAY.

20:54.172 --> 20:58.000
AND I WILL PICK THE OTHER
CHRIS KATTAN.

20:58.034 --> 21:01.655
I AM A LITTLE SURPRISED, A
DEFINITELY THOUGHT WE KNOW TO

21:01.689 --> 21:07.137
GIVE IT TO TEDDI.
I GUESS CHRIS AND I AREN'T AS

21:07.172 --> 21:11.931
IN SIRN AS I THOUGHT.
I KNEW T I KNEW T I KNEW IT.

21:11.965 --> 21:22.275
I GAVE THE HALT TO TODD
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HIM.

21:22.310 --> 21:29.586
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I GAVE IT TO TODD BECAUSE HE

21:29.620 --> 21:33.413
SNORES AT NIGHT.
EVENIE MEANIE MINY.

21:33.448 --> 21:38.620
I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE
IT TO ME.

21:38.655 --> 21:43.931
YOU ENDED UP WITH THE MO.
LAMAR.

21:43.965 --> 21:45.068
I JUST THOUGHT YOU WOULD LOOK
REALLY GOOD IN THE HAT.

21:45.103 --> 21:46.310
I'LL TAKE IT.
THE ONLY RECIPIENTS LEFT TO

21:46.344 --> 21:49.517
WEAR THE HAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE
FORMATION, WHICH IS GREAT

21:49.551 --> 21:55.551
BECAUSE ONE OF US IS DEFINITELY
GOING TO BE SAFE.

21:55.586 --> 22:00.551
YOU AND MIESHA NOMINATE EACH
OTHER, YOU THINK YOU BEING

22:00.586 --> 22:02.896
INCONSPICUOUS.
STOP TALKING GAME TO ME IN

22:02.931 --> 22:16.172
FRONT OF EVERYBODY IN THE GAME.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

22:16.206 --> 22:20.344
ARE YOU TRYING TO REMEMBER.
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYONE'S

22:20.379 --> 22:24.896
NAME, GUYS, THIS IS NOT.
CARSON.

22:24.931 --> 22:26.689
OH.
I WOULD LOVE TO RECEIVE THE

22:26.724 --> 22:33.758
HAT FROM YOU, THANK YOU.
NO WORRIES.

22:33.793 --> 22:38.310
HE GETS ME.
I WILL SAY TODRICK.

22:38.344 --> 22:40.241
OKAY.
PART OF THE BIGGER PLAP.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.482
THANK YOU FRIEND.
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN THIS

22:42.517 --> 22:48.310
HOUSE WITHOUT ME.
I CAN'T BE HERE WITHOUT YOU

22:48.344 --> 22:59.241
DOES ANYBODY WANT THE HAT.
THIS IS NOT FUN.

22:59.275 --> 23:03.896
I FEEL LIKE MIRAI ALREADY
TRUSTS ME SO BY GIVING HER THE

23:03.931 --> 23:06.931
HAT THEREIS TRUST FOR SHANNA
WHICH I THINK WILL BE HELPFUL

23:06.965 --> 23:11.034
FOR ME IN THE GAME.
IT'S NOT FUN.

23:11.068 --> 23:16.172
>>.
THE LAST PERSON TO RECEIVE

23:16.206 --> 23:20.310
THE HAT IS SAFE FOR THE WEEK SO
I'M GOING TO NAME MIRAI TO GIVE

23:20.344 --> 23:25.379
THIS HAT TO SHANNA SO THAT I CAN
BE FASHIONABLY LATE TO THE GALA.

23:25.413 --> 23:31.965
MY WORST NIGHTMARE IN THIS
GAME IS GOING HOME FIRST BEING

23:32.000 --> 23:35.482
MISS MONDAYJUAN WILL GUARANTEE
MY SAFETY, I WANT THIS, I NEED

23:35.517 --> 23:45.344
THIS.
I AM SO READY TO BE CROWNED.

23:45.379 --> 23:51.620
I HAVE TO MICK WHO IS SAFE THIS
WEEK.

23:51.655 --> 23:55.965
EITHER SHANNA OR CYNTHIA.
THEY'RE BOTH IN THE FORMATION.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.724
I FEEL A LOT OF PRESSURE.
MIR-- MIRAI, WHO ARE YOU

24:00.758 --> 24:01.000
GOING WITH?

25:31.551 --> 25:37.310
NOT NOMINATED, YOU COULD STILL
BE GOING HOME.

25:37.344 --> 25:43.862
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?
THE MON WON HAT IS BOTH A

25:43.896 --> 25:48.724
BLESSING AND A CURSE.
SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

25:48.758 --> 25:49.724
WHAT IS THIS CURSE.
THIS HAS ME AND ALL OF THE

25:49.758 --> 25:51.379
FORMATION SHOOK, AS THE KIDS
SAY.

25:51.413 --> 25:56.137
I THINK POSSIBLY YOU COULD
DECIDE SOMEONE GOING HOME

25:56.172 --> 25:58.068
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE POWER OF
MON WON.

25:58.103 --> 26:01.379
SO THIS TWIST IS HUGE, EVEN
IF YOU ARE NOT ON THE BLOCK, YOU

26:01.413 --> 26:12.275
ARE STILL NOT SAFE, IT IS JUST
TERRIFYING.

26:12.310 --> 26:17.137
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS COULD
SEND MAY HOME.

26:17.172 --> 26:19.034
STOP IT.
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO GO

26:19.068 --> 26:21.827
HOME T IS MAKING ME REALLY
EMOTIONAL.

26:21.862 --> 26:25.344
SO SHOULD WE HAVE TAKEN IT
PERSONALLY WHO GAVE YOU THE

26:25.379 --> 26:28.034
PURSE, OR THE HAT.
I ACTUALLY DIDN'T TAKE IT

26:28.068 --> 26:30.103
PERSONALLY.
IT MADE ME A LITTLE BIT MORE

26:30.137 --> 26:34.034
WORRIED.
I AM SUPER RELIEVED THAT

26:34.068 --> 26:37.620
TEDDI DID NOT GET THIS MON WON
HAT BUT THIS TWIST COULD TO THE

26:37.655 --> 26:49.827
TALLY MESS UP MY H.O.H. GAME.
IF THE H.O.H. GIVES YOU THE

26:49.862 --> 26:53.000
BAG FIRST.
>>-- HOA.

26:53.034 --> 26:55.620
THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION?
H.O.H.

26:55.655 --> 26:58.344
I SAID THAT TOO, HOA EARLIER.
H.O.H.

26:58.379 --> 27:00.655
SHOULD I BE FREAKING OUT
RIGHT NOW?

27:00.689 --> 27:02.655
YOU STILL LIKE ME, RIGHT?
YEAH.

27:02.689 --> 27:07.758
THAT'S FAIR.
SO AT THIS POINT IF THE GAME

27:07.793 --> 27:09.034
TEDDI SHOULD BE WORRIED BECAUSE
IT LOOKS LIKE MIESHA IS COMING

27:09.068 --> 27:10.620
AFTER HER.
HI, CHRIS.

27:10.655 --> 27:13.586
I PROMISE I STILL LIKE YOU.
THAT'S FINE.

27:13.620 --> 27:21.068
DOESN'T HURT MY FEELINGS.
YOU ARE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.

27:21.103 --> 27:22.241
AM I HIGH ON THE ROAD OR LOW ON
THE ROAD.

27:22.275 --> 27:25.655
I HAVE NO IDEA TO BE HONEST.
TWO TIMES, SHUT ME DOWN.

27:25.689 --> 27:29.586
I'M NOT HIGH ROAD, I'M NOT LOW
ROAD, WHICH MEANS I'M PROBABLY

27:29.620 --> 27:32.413
LIKE THE ROAD HOME.
THIS MEANS I'VE GOT TO FIGURE

27:32.448 --> 27:38.586
OUT HOW I COULD BE TRUE TO ME,
BUT YET STILL MAKE THINGS

27:38.620 --> 27:41.310
HAPPEN.
I JUST THINK IT'S SCARY THAT

27:41.344 --> 27:52.551
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WE'RE ALL
LIKE IN TROUBLE.

27:52.586 --> 27:58.965
I CAN'T WAIT.
I WANT TO ADD MIRAI TO THE

27:59.000 --> 28:01.793
ALLIANCE BECAUSE SHE DID SO
GREAT IN THE H.O.H. COMPETITION.

28:01.827 --> 28:04.655
AND I RECOGNIZE THAT FIERCE
COMPETITOR IN HER.

28:04.689 --> 28:07.206
I THINK SHE WOULD MAKE A GREAT
ADDITION TO IT THE ALLIANCE.

28:07.241 --> 28:10.034
I THINK WE NEED TO STICK
TOGETHER TO START WITH.

28:10.068 --> 28:16.068
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE FOR

28:16.103 --> 28:19.034
YOU TO JOIN OUR ALLIANCE.
I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP THE

28:19.068 --> 28:22.137
STRONG LINKS TOGETHER SO THAT
HOPEFULLY WE CAN KEEP THE BALL

28:22.172 --> 28:26.034
IN OUR COURT AND WE SEE.
WHO IS STRONG TO YOU?

28:26.068 --> 28:35.103
TODRICK WAS THE FIRST PERSON.
LAMAR, AND.

28:35.137 --> 28:37.034
I APPRECIATE THAT YOU THINK
I'M STRONG.

28:37.068 --> 28:41.000
I DO, I THINK YOU ARE A
REALLY STRONG PLAYER IN THIS

28:41.034 --> 28:48.103
GAME, MY INITIAL THOUGHT WAS SHE
PUT UP CHRIS KATTAN AND TODD AS

28:48.137 --> 28:53.724
THE OTHER ONE.
AND IF WE CAN MAINTAIN POWER OF

28:53.758 --> 29:01.000
VETO THEN I WOULD LIKE IT USED,
AND I WOULD PUT UP TEDDI.

29:01.034 --> 29:03.965
I THINK THAT SHE KNOWS MORE
ABOUT THE GAME THAN SHE'S

29:04.000 --> 29:06.827
LETTING ON.
AND ALSO IS THE BIGGEST THREAT.

29:06.862 --> 29:09.000
UH-HUH.
OUTSIDE.

29:09.034 --> 29:13.448
BUT HERE'S THE OTHER THING, IF I
WANT TO GIVE OUR ALLIANCE THE

29:13.482 --> 29:17.310
BEST CHANCE AT KEEPING CONTROL
OF THE VETO SO THAT WE CAN GET

29:17.344 --> 29:24.344
TEDDI UP ON THERE, THEN I MAY
NEED A STRONGER PLAYER TO BE

29:24.379 --> 29:26.758
DOMINATED.
LIKE HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT

29:26.793 --> 29:43.034
GOING UP ON THE BLOCK AS A PAWN?
I PROMISE YOU, I SWEAR ON

29:43.068 --> 29:44.172
LIKE EVERYTHING THAT IS ANYTHING
TO KNEE THAT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY

29:44.206 --> 29:49.034
NOT MY TARGET THIS WEEK.
I'M CONFUSEDMENT I DO NOT

29:49.068 --> 29:52.862
WANT TO BE PAWNMENT I DON'T WANT
TEDDI TO GO.

29:52.896 --> 30:00.137
AND I TOLD THE FORMATION THAT
THEY HAVE MY LOYALTY.

30:00.172 --> 30:04.724
THIS IS A BRUTAL GAME BUT FAKE
IT TILL YOU MAKE IT.

30:04.758 --> 30:07.103
I WILL THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE
BIT.

30:07.137 --> 30:09.344
OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR TRUSTING ME.

30:41.413 --> 30:43.517
SHE IS TARGETING YOU.

30:43.551 --> 30:47.896
I KNEW SHE IS WAS.
I'M ACTUALLY NOT SURPRISED

30:47.931 --> 30:53.551
THAT MIESHA MAY BE COMING AFTER
ME BECAUSE I THINK I SHOCKED

30:53.586 --> 30:59.551
EVERYONE A LITTLE BIT BY BEING
ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, STAY IN THE

30:59.586 --> 31:06.758
LONGER THAN EVERYONE THOUGHT.
SHE IS GOING TO BACK DOOR YOU

31:06.793 --> 31:09.137
BECAUSE YOU ARE A THREAT.
I HAVE REPEATEDLY TOLD MYSELF

31:09.172 --> 31:12.965
YOU CANNOT GO HOME WEEK ONE.
AND HERE WE GO.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.758
MIESHA IS TRYING TO EVICT ME
WITHOUT GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO

31:16.793 --> 31:21.586
PLAY IN THE POWER OF VETO.
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL A BACK

31:21.620 --> 31:25.379
DOOR FLAN.
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN MY EYES ARE

31:25.413 --> 31:37.482
WIDE OPEN.
I'M NOT GOING TO GO-- .

31:37.517 --> 31:54.068
WHAT?
MIRAI, IT'S WAY TOO EARLY TO

31:54.103 --> 31:57.344
BE GOING AND TELLING PEOPLE
SECRETS ESPECIALLY IF THE PERSON

31:57.379 --> 32:06.137
SECRETS YOU'RE TELLING IS THE
CURRENT H.O.H.

32:06.172 --> 32:15.827
SHE THINKS SHE SHOULD BACK
DOOR ME BUT I THINK SHE'S STILL

32:15.862 --> 32:25.758
UNDECIDED.
OH MY GOODNESS.

32:25.793 --> 32:30.103
I AM IN THE FORMATION ALLIANCE
AND ALSO WORKING WITH MIESHA.

32:30.137 --> 32:33.827
IF ANYONE ELSE IS PLAYING BOTH
SIDES IT IS MIRAI AND THE FACT

32:33.862 --> 32:37.000
SHE IS WILLING TO RAT ON MIESHA
WHO IS THE CURRENT H.O.H. MEANS

32:37.034 --> 32:40.068
SHE WOULD DO THE SAME THING TO
ME AM HAVE I TO TELL MIESHA

32:40.103 --> 32:43.275
THIS.
MIRAI, THIS IS NOT A GOOD MOVE,

32:43.310 --> 32:50.241
DARLING.
NOT A GOOD MOVE.

33:25.931 --> 33:40.827
THERE WE GO.
BABY.

33:53.413 --> 33:57.241
I THINK THE BEST MOVE IS TO LET
HER KNOW THINGS THAT ARE

33:57.275 --> 34:00.172
HAPPENING DOWNSTAIRS, THAT SHE
CAN'T HEAR, THAT IS LIKE PUTTING

34:00.206 --> 34:03.689
OTHER PEOPLE AND TARGETS IN
FRONT OF ME BUT ALSO BUILDING

34:03.724 --> 34:07.068
TRUST WITH MIESHA WHO I THINK IS
ONE OF THE MOST SWEET PEOPLE TO

34:07.103 --> 34:12.172
EVER PLAY THIS GAME.
SHE'S NOT SOMEBODY YOU WANT ON

34:12.206 --> 34:28.310
YOUR BAD SIDE.
SHE IS TALKING TO PEOPLE.

34:28.344 --> 34:34.206
SHE IS TALKING TO TEDDI.
THAT MIRAI TOLD HER SHE'S IN

34:34.241 --> 34:37.000
TROUBLE.
MIRAI, SERIOUSLY?

34:37.034 --> 34:42.344
I JUST INCLUDED YOU IN THE PLAN
AND YOU CANNOT EVEN WAIT 10

34:42.379 --> 34:45.758
SECONDS TO GO AND SPILL THE
BEANS?

34:45.793 --> 34:51.931
NOW I'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH AN
ENTIRE NEW GAME PLAN.

34:51.965 --> 34:59.862
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU BUT I
DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD TALK TO

34:59.896 --> 35:10.655
ANYONE ELSE.
AT LEAST I HAVE A LOT OF

35:10.689 --> 35:15.137
OPTIONS, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT
WAYS THAT I COULD GO WITH THIS,

35:15.172 --> 35:17.689
BUT IT'S GOING TO GET TOUGH.
YEAH.

35:17.724 --> 35:20.965
I THINK BACK DOORING IS THE
WORST WAY TO LOSE AND I REALIZE

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
IN THIS MOMENT THE ONLY WAY I'M
GOING IT TO SAVE MYSELF IS BY

35:25.034 --> 35:30.517
OFFERING MIESHA A DEAL AND I
TRULY MEAN THIS.

35:30.551 --> 35:35.689
I DON'T NEED TO MAKE A SORT OF
OVERALL DEAL, I THINK IT IS TOO

35:35.724 --> 35:37.172
EARLY TO EVEN PUT YOU IN THAT
SITUATION.

35:37.206 --> 35:41.931
BUT CAN I TELL YOU THIS, IF YOU
DON'T PUT ME UP, I WON'T PUT YOU

35:41.965 --> 35:46.103
UP THE NEXT TIME.
AND I GIVE YOU MY WORD.

35:46.137 --> 35:49.482
IF I DON'T PUT YOU UP THIS WEEK,
YOU WON'T PUT ME UP THE NEXT

35:49.517 --> 35:53.965
TIME, BUT FOR HOW LONG IN THE
GAME IS THAT GOOD FOR.

35:54.000 --> 36:00.482
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF WEEKS.
YEAH.

36:00.517 --> 36:02.931
SO WE CAN HAVE ANOTHER
CONVERSATION.

36:02.965 --> 36:04.551
TRUE.
I BELIEVE HER AND THAT IS WHY

36:04.586 --> 36:08.000
THIS DEAL IS SUDDENLY SO
INTERESTING TO ME.

36:08.034 --> 36:12.206
YOU LOYALTY, HONESTY IS A BIG
FACTOR FOR ME TOO.

36:12.241 --> 36:18.275
YOU KNOW, SO FEELING LIKE I CAN
TRUST SOMEBODY OR WHATEVER IT

36:18.310 --> 36:23.793
IS, MORE IMPORTANT TO ME LIKE IF
I DIRECTLY GIVE YOU MY WORD ON

36:23.827 --> 36:28.551
SOMETHING, YEAH, FOR SURE.
NOW I AM PRESENTED WITH A

36:28.586 --> 36:33.482
REALLY TOUGH CHOICE, EITHER I
CAN CONTINUE TO TARGET TEDDI OR

36:33.517 --> 36:38.689
TAKE TEDDI'S DEAL AND TAKE OUT
THE NEXT STRONGEST PERSON WHICH

36:38.724 --> 36:46.241
WOULD BE MIRAI.
I LIKE THAT TOO.

36:46.275 --> 36:46.620
YEAH.

36:57.172 --> 37:01.931
I NEED ONE OF THOSE.
OH YEAH, I CAN GET YOU ONE.

37:01.965 --> 37:08.724
ALL RIGHT.
SO I WANT TO OFFER YOU SAFETY

37:08.758 --> 37:11.931
THIS WEEK BUT HAVE I A PLAN.
OKAY.

37:11.965 --> 37:13.310
BUT.
YES.

37:13.344 --> 37:15.965

BLOCK.

37:25.758 --> 37:27.379
THINKING THIS.
OKAY.

37:27.413 --> 37:31.655

37:38.206 --> 37:40.241
HAPPENING.
