00:01.102 --> 00:01.235
.

00:02.236 --> 00:02.870
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:02.903 --> 00:03.904
sexually based offenses

00:03.937 --> 00:06.574
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.607 --> 00:09.077
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.110 --> 00:10.578
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.611 --> 00:12.313
are members of an elite squad

00:12.346 --> 00:14.415
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.150
These are their stories.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.353
- To the ancient Greeks,

00:19.387 --> 00:24.525
the male body symbolized harmony
and perfection.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.061
- He's so hot.
I'd rather screw him

00:27.095 --> 00:28.062
than draw him.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.063
- I got to go.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.231
- And since then...

00:30.264 --> 00:32.133
- Lunch date?

00:32.166 --> 00:33.634
- Even when the figure
in a static pos--

00:33.667 --> 00:36.637
[hip-hop playing
in background]

00:36.670 --> 00:44.044
*

01:19.547 --> 01:21.449
- Excuse me, miss?

01:21.482 --> 01:22.550
Halibut crostini?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.084
- No, thanks.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.619
[door opens]

02:11.665 --> 02:14.134
[screaming]

02:17.205 --> 02:18.706
- Vic took a bad beating.
Lost lots of blood.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.542
Obvious signs of sexual assault.
Someone did her with a pipe.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.676
- We recover it?

02:22.710 --> 02:24.212
- Yeah, didn't have
to look too far.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.579
It was on the bathroom
next to the vic.

02:25.613 --> 02:26.547
- Who found her?

02:26.580 --> 02:28.449
- Mom and daughter.
- Did they see anything?

02:28.482 --> 02:29.583
- Male. Black. 30s.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.651
That ought to narrow it down.

02:30.684 --> 02:31.752
- Okay. Any other witnesses?

02:31.785 --> 02:33.187
- Still looking.
Nothing so far.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.355
- What about security cameras?

02:34.388 --> 02:36.257
- Nothing in the hallway
or the bathroom.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.693
There's something else.
Take a look at the vic's ID.

02:41.762 --> 02:45.266
- A public bathroom
of a crowded mall

02:45.299 --> 02:46.267
in broad daylight.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.968
This is a hell of a place
to attack someone.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.938
- Or it's the perfect place.

02:50.971 --> 02:53.307
Vic is transgender.

02:59.247 --> 03:02.216
[dramatic music]

03:02.250 --> 03:09.290
*

03:46.427 --> 03:47.661
- Do these people go by
him or her?

03:47.695 --> 03:49.863
- Well, this person goes by her.

03:49.897 --> 03:54.034
- Okay. I found her
on the floor, near the stall,

03:54.067 --> 03:56.704
dress pulled up over her...
you know.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.971
- Yes.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.807
- She was unconscious,
so I called 911.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.676
- Is she gonna be okay?
- We hope so.

04:02.710 --> 04:03.644
You know what?

04:03.677 --> 04:04.845
We really want to find out
who did this to her,

04:04.878 --> 04:08.048
so can you tell us about the man
that you saw in the hallway?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.750
- Like I told
the other policeman,

04:09.783 --> 04:11.819
he was black,
late 20s, early 30s.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.953
I didn't see his face,

04:12.986 --> 04:15.022
but there was blood
on his pants.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.290
That's all I remember.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.925
- Was he tall?
Short? Heavy?

04:17.958 --> 04:20.761
- Average.
I really don't remember.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.297
- He was big.
- Sophie, let Mommy handle this.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.765
- So he was big, Sophie?

04:25.833 --> 04:27.701
- For God's sake,
she's ten years old.

04:27.735 --> 04:28.602
- Please.

04:28.636 --> 04:32.373
So, Sophie,
the woman that we found--

04:32.406 --> 04:33.841
she really needs your help.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.943
So if there's anything
that you can remember

04:35.976 --> 04:37.545
about the man in the hallway--

04:37.578 --> 04:39.079
did he have any tattoos?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.981
- She doesn't remember
anything else.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.983
Right, sweetie?

04:43.951 --> 04:46.920
- Yes.
I-I don't remember.

04:46.954 --> 04:50.424
- Okay. Okay, well,
thank you for trying, Sophie.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.893
And thank you so much
for being so cooperative.

04:53.894 --> 04:54.728
- It was just a matter of time

04:54.762 --> 04:56.997
before something like this
happened.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.499
Everyone had to make
such a big fuss

04:58.532 --> 04:59.867
over this transgender issue.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.569
Why can't people use
the damn bathroom

05:01.602 --> 05:02.836
they were born to use?

05:02.870 --> 05:04.538
Is that really so hard?

05:06.039 --> 05:07.375
- We'll be in touch.
Thank you.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.909
Thank you, Sophie.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.047
- Vic's legal name
is Eric Carson.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.817
She's a 24-year-old art student
from Montclair, New Jersey.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.552
Seems like she goes
by the name Eva these days.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.554
- Parents?
- They're on their way.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.590
- This is the nurse.
- Hey. What do we got?

05:22.623 --> 05:24.392
- Rape kit showed
forced penetration,

05:24.425 --> 05:25.593
severe tearing and bleeding,

05:25.626 --> 05:27.094
perforated colon--

05:27.127 --> 05:30.063
significant blunt force trauma
to the head and torso as well.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.064
She's lucky to be alive.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.566
- Okay. Semen?

05:32.600 --> 05:34.502
Is there any sign
of intercourse?

05:34.535 --> 05:35.503
- No.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.837
- Defensive wounds?

05:36.870 --> 05:37.905
- Bruises
on her wrists and arms.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.807
We're checking her nails
for DNA.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.808
- Thank you.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.843
- Okay.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.379
So a transgender art student
from the suburbs

05:45.413 --> 05:48.382
gets beaten and raped
with a pipe in a public restroom

05:48.416 --> 05:49.783
just months
after New York State signs

05:49.817 --> 05:51.852
the gender-neutral
bathroom bill.

05:51.885 --> 05:52.953
Media's gonna be all over this.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.622
- Yeah, for good reason.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.458
This is a hate crime.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.894
Mr. and Mrs. Carson.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.596
I'm Lieutenant Benson from SVU.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.031
- When can we see our daughter?

06:04.064 --> 06:05.899
- You know,
I'm not exactly sure,

06:05.933 --> 06:07.901
but the doctor will
be out shortly

06:07.935 --> 06:08.769
to give you an update.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.071
In the meantime,
if it's okay with you,

06:11.104 --> 06:14.542
I'd like to ask you
a few questions about Eva.

06:14.575 --> 06:17.911
So when is the last time
either of you saw her?

06:17.945 --> 06:18.912
- Last night.

06:18.946 --> 06:22.082
She called me around midnight.
She was upset.

06:22.115 --> 06:26.587
Said she was having
relationship issues.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.121
Who the hell would do something
like this?

06:28.155 --> 06:29.890
She's 5'7", 120 pounds,
for God's sake.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.525
- Yeah, I'll tell you who.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.561
Some religious,
transphobic monster--

06:33.594 --> 06:34.928
- Honey--
- Who's afraid of a man

06:34.962 --> 06:36.897
living as a woman.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.566
When Eva said
she wanted to transition,

06:38.599 --> 06:40.200
we supported her,

06:40.233 --> 06:42.169
but I was afraid
she might get targeted.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.137
So many of these young women
get assaulted.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.205
- It's okay.
She's gonna be fine.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.841
- You said that she was having
relationship issues.

06:47.875 --> 06:51.111
Did she have a boyfriend
or a girlfriend?

06:51.144 --> 06:53.547
- Yes, she had a boyfriend.
His name is Logan.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.882
But they broke up.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.985
- Then got back together again
last week.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.219
Eva confides in me.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.855
That's why she called me
last night.

07:01.889 --> 07:02.923
They were fighting.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.124
- Fighting?
About what?

07:04.157 --> 07:05.993
- He thought
she was seeing somebody else.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.160
- And was she?

07:07.194 --> 07:08.896
- I'm not sure.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.834
- Is she okay?

07:13.867 --> 07:16.136
I called the hospital,
and they won't tell me anything.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.070
- Well, we are not sure.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.906
The doctors are doing
the best they can.

07:18.939 --> 07:19.840
- Right. Okay.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.942
I should really--
can we do this later?

07:21.975 --> 07:24.177
I want to go to the hospital.
I want to talk to Eva's parents.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.713
I want to be there
when she wakes up.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.715
- You know, actually,
we'd prefer to do it now,

07:27.748 --> 07:29.149
but it shouldn't take long.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.552
- Okay.
What do you want to know?

07:31.585 --> 07:34.221
- Where were you today
between 12:00 and 1:00 p.m.?

07:36.189 --> 07:39.927
- Okay. I was here all day,
since 8:00 a.m., in my office.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.729
I ran out for a quick lunch
around noon.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.196
- Oh, great.
Did you eat around here?

07:43.230 --> 07:44.231
- Yeah, a diner in Tribeca.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.033
- Well, Eva's father
said that...

07:46.066 --> 07:48.235
that you two were fighting
last night.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.671
- It wasn't serious.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.574
I love Eva.
- Yeah.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.643
Let me count the ways.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.911
"I'm tired of your lies."

07:57.945 --> 07:59.747
"I'm starting to despise you."

07:59.780 --> 08:01.181
"I wish you'd disappear."

08:01.214 --> 08:03.551
- I mean, I'd hate to see
your serious arguments.

08:03.584 --> 08:07.020
- Look, I lost my temper, okay?

08:07.054 --> 08:10.257
She was--
our relationship is complicated.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.225
- Complicated how?

08:12.259 --> 08:14.261
- Well, for starters,
she's transgender.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.963
No matter how
open-minded you are,

08:15.996 --> 08:17.931
it's still challenging.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.132
- What are some
of the other ways

08:19.166 --> 08:21.234
that your relationship
was challenging?

08:21.268 --> 08:22.670
- She started working
as a model.

08:22.703 --> 08:24.538
Getting paid to go
to clubs, parties.

08:24.572 --> 08:26.006
Getting paid
a thousand bucks a night.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.975
- That sounds like a good gig.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.977
- It ruined her.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.179
She started falling in love
with the "it" crowd.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.682
The scene.
All that crap.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.685
You know, luckily,
her agency fired her last week.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.052
- Why'd she get canned?

08:39.086 --> 08:41.021
- She got into an altercation
with a guest.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.590
Last Thursday, I think.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.693
- Where was that?

08:48.762 --> 08:50.197
- An altercation?

08:50.230 --> 08:51.799
Yeah,
there's about ten every night.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.567
- Yeah, well,
how about last Thursday?

08:53.601 --> 08:55.068
You recognize her?

08:55.102 --> 08:56.169
- [sighs]
Uh...

08:56.203 --> 08:58.005
Yeah. Maybe.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.707
Look, guys,
I'm happy to help and all,

08:59.740 --> 09:01.975
but I don't need a lawsuit here.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.811
- Who said anything
about a lawsuit?

09:03.844 --> 09:04.812
- These days,
those trans people--

09:04.845 --> 09:06.780
or whatever you call 'em--
they could sue you

09:06.814 --> 09:08.215
just for looking at 'em
sideways.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.583
- So you do remember her?

09:10.718 --> 09:12.986
- A big music company
threw a party Thursday night.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.622
There were a lot of models here.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.789
A few of 'em were transgender.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.791
- What was
the altercation about?

09:17.825 --> 09:19.226
- She slapped
one of the guests--

09:19.259 --> 09:22.262
you know, made a scene--
so we tossed her ass.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.032
- Got any of that on video?

09:25.833 --> 09:27.067
- Right there.
That's Eva.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.237
- Mm-hmm.

09:30.270 --> 09:33.106
- It looked personal.
- Who's the guy she slapped?

09:33.140 --> 09:33.974
- I don't know.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.743
- Know the other guys
in his posse?

09:35.776 --> 09:36.810
- Nah.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.278
I'm not into
the whole hip-hop thing.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.680
I like country music.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.814
- All right.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.651
Just give us the name of the guy
who tossed Eva, please.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.152
- Eva's still on life support.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.087
The doctors say
it doesn't look good.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.088
- Okay.
Where are we on forensics?

09:48.121 --> 09:50.023
- No prints on the pipes.
Still waiting on DNA.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.059
- Just got off the phone
with the event planner.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.127
He says he doesn't know the name
of the guy who got slapped,

09:54.161 --> 09:56.129
but he does know he was a guest
of Vincent Love's.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.698
- Vincent Love,
the rap guy?

09:57.731 --> 09:59.366
- Yeah, the founder
of One-Eight-Seven Music.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.168
He works with
the biggest names out there.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.803
- So I'm guessing
that big-name rappers

10:02.836 --> 10:05.205
don't appreciate getting slapped
by transgender models.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.840
All right.
Let's find Vincent Love

10:06.874 --> 10:09.209
and find out
exactly what happened.

10:13.847 --> 10:14.848
- I mean,
we having a good time.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.739
- So, who was the guy
she slapped?

She gets offended.

You're obviously not a big fan
of gay and transgender people.

You didn't try
to teach Eva a lesson?

14:29.602 --> 14:33.206

beat down some boy with a dress

14:33.240 --> 14:34.174

- Nope.

there at the same place,

14:44.251 --> 14:46.119
same time,
but you didn't see her?

14:46.153 --> 14:49.056
- That sounds like
one hell of a coincidence to me.

- Not to me.

what was the meeting about?

15:48.215 --> 15:50.250
I put down a deposit.
5 grand.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.385
I went back to convince
the doctor to get a refund.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.054
- How long
were you at this meeting?

15:54.087 --> 15:55.188
- An hour or so.
Look, guys.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.204
- I should've been
more forthcoming.

16:11.238 --> 16:14.041
I get it.
I'm sorry.

16:14.074 --> 16:17.010
Eva and I were having problems.

16:17.044 --> 16:19.346
She was starting to see
someone else.

16:19.379 --> 16:22.415
I think that's why she changed
her mind about the operation.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.450
- What do you mean?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.785

16:25.818 --> 16:29.022
I think he likes her
just the way she is.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.457
- Do you know
this other guy's name?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.459
- I don't know his name,

16:32.492 --> 16:36.229
but I saw him in the park
the other day,

16:36.263 --> 16:37.464

There he is right there.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.376

16:49.409 --> 16:51.444
That's Hype's business partner
and producer.

Weapons. Narcotics.

for added measure.

with Eva behind Logan's back.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.322
Why would he beat and rape her?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.556

- Yeah, so you and Eva
were hanging out?

17:12.365 --> 17:15.335
- Hanging out? No, I don't mess
with that gay stuff.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.403
We was talking business.

17:16.436 --> 17:19.206
- What kind of business?

17:19.239 --> 17:22.275
- Eva's a songwriter.
She wrote some rhymes for Hype.

17:22.309 --> 17:23.543
- Wait a minute.
You're telling me

17:23.576 --> 17:25.345
Eva wrote some of Hype's raps?

17:25.378 --> 17:26.779
- Yeah.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.382
- [scoffs]
Thought she was an art student.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.419
- She's an art student
that writes rhymes.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.121
So me and Vincent
bought her out.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.455
Gave her some bread
to stay anonymous.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.157
- That makes sense.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.360
Didn't want a trans girl's name
on the album as a writer.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.561
- How much did you give her?

17:41.594 --> 17:43.496
- 50 grand.

we could've paid her

17:45.432 --> 17:46.399

- That's not a nice way

17:48.135 --> 17:50.603
to describe someone
who's fighting for her life.

17:50.637 --> 17:53.306

about this freak?

17:53.340 --> 17:55.442
Y'all can call my lawyer.

17:57.544 --> 18:01.381
- $50,000,
payable to Eric Carson, aka Eva.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.854
- Okay, so why did
she rip it up?

18:07.887 --> 18:09.589
- I'm guessing out of principle.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.125
- Cash the check first.
Worry about principle later.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.059
- All right.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.861
So Cash and Vincent Love
try to bribe Eva.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.363
She says no.
Then what?

18:16.396 --> 18:19.399
- Well, Hype's worried
about some transgender girl

18:19.432 --> 18:22.335
telling the whole world that she
writes all his hardcore raps.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.404
- Okay, that sounds
like possible motive to me.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.639
- Yeah, but for who?
Cash? Hype? Vincent Love?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.408
- My money's on Hype.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.143
- What do you mean?
- I just spoke with the lab.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.611
They found his DNA

18:31.644 --> 18:32.445

18:46.226 --> 18:47.360
[phone rings]

18:47.394 --> 18:48.561
- Hey, Rollins.
What's up?

18:48.595 --> 18:49.862
- Hype's on the move.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.030
He just stepped out
of his studio.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.665
- All right.
We'll be with you in a minute.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.267
Judge is signing
the warrants now.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.468
Don't take your eyes off him.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.478
[phone rings]

19:05.512 --> 19:06.946
Hey, Rollins.
What do you got?

19:06.979 --> 19:09.249
- He's in a cab right now,
headed west.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.483
He's on 37th and 7th.

19:10.517 --> 19:11.351
- 37th and 7th?

19:11.384 --> 19:13.486
That's close
to the hospital Eva's at.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.221
- That's what I'm thinking.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.955
- All right.
We're on our way.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.524
- Hype's on the way
to the hospital?

19:17.557 --> 19:20.560
Kid's crazier than I thought.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.399
- He's definitely headed
to the hospital.

19:26.433 --> 19:27.467
We're both right out front.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.635
I'm right behind him.

19:32.739 --> 19:35.575
- Hey! NYPD!
- Oh, sh--

19:36.976 --> 19:38.611
- Stay down! Don't move!
- Stay on the ground!

19:38.645 --> 19:39.946
- Don't you move!
- You got a gun?

19:39.979 --> 19:41.414
- No! What the hell
are y'all doing, yo?

19:41.448 --> 19:43.416
- All right.
He's clean. Come on.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.551
- You're under arrest for rape

19:44.584 --> 19:46.619
and assault
with a deadly weapon.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.621
- All right.
Get up.

19:51.424 --> 19:55.228
- Hype, we have your DNA
under Eva's fingernails.

19:55.262 --> 19:58.598
We have you near the crime scene
20 minutes before the attack,

19:58.631 --> 20:01.901
and as for motive,
there's too many to choose from.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.169
- Hate. Greed.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.638
- Not to mention that you were
heading toward the hospital--

20:05.672 --> 20:07.507
to what--
to kill her?

20:07.540 --> 20:10.543
To make sure that she never
woke up so she couldn't ID you?

20:10.577 --> 20:13.480
- Hype.
You gotta come clean, man.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.415
We already have enough
to charge you.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.683
- He's right.

20:16.716 --> 20:19.419
We're just being polite.

20:19.452 --> 20:24.491
We're giving you a chance
to tell us what really happened.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.527
- Now, you can start
by telling us

20:27.560 --> 20:30.597
how your DNA got
under Eva's fingernails.

20:34.601 --> 20:35.535
- Okay.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.407
But if I tell y'all,

20:40.440 --> 20:41.608
will you promise
to keep it private?

20:41.641 --> 20:43.476
- Absolutely.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.315
We won't say a word.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.050
- Like, for real?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.352
You can't tell no one.

20:52.385 --> 20:53.953
- For real.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.423
- Okay. Cool.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.590
I appreciate that.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.294
So...

21:01.328 --> 21:04.597
the reason my skin
is underneath her fingernails

21:04.631 --> 21:07.800
is because...

21:07.834 --> 21:09.636
we had sex.

21:11.338 --> 21:15.408
We...
we're dating.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.544
We're in love.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.580
[soft music]

21:28.555 --> 21:28.688
.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.424
- So Hype's in love with Eva.

21:31.458 --> 21:32.459
- That's what he says.
- And you believe him?

21:32.492 --> 21:34.093
- He seems credible,
but he's told so many lies.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.728
It's really hard to tell
where he's coming from.

21:35.762 --> 21:38.030
- That's what makes me believe
he's telling the truth.

21:38.064 --> 21:38.965
- How so?

21:38.998 --> 21:41.067
- I mean,
Hype's an up-and-coming rapper.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.001
Hardcore, at that.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.836
- So he's been lying
to protect his image.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.505
- His career.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.340
I mean, this style of rapping's
all about reputation.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.608
It's all about street cred.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.410
For him to tell his fans
that he's in love

21:50.443 --> 21:52.745
with a transgender woman--
they'd laugh at him.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.714
His whole brand
would go up in smoke.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.816
- It's 2016, for God's sakes.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.751
- Not for people selling
gangster rap.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.387
- Yeah, or some of my relatives.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.489
- Or mine too.
- Look.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.358
This whole gender fluidity thing
is coming out more nowadays,

22:05.392 --> 22:06.359
and that's cool,

22:06.393 --> 22:07.794
but the truth is it's confusing,

22:07.827 --> 22:09.629
and a lot of people
can't make sense of it all.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.630
Me included.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.031
- And our friend Hype.

22:12.064 --> 22:14.100
- Okay, so let's say
we believe this guy,

22:14.133 --> 22:15.568
that he really does love Eva.

22:15.602 --> 22:17.370
That still doesn't
make him innocent.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.638
- Listen, I agree.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.674
All that denial
and self-hatred...

22:22.675 --> 22:23.643
Who knows?

22:23.676 --> 22:26.112
Maybe Hype did just crack

22:26.145 --> 22:27.279
and took out all his rage
on Eva.

22:27.313 --> 22:31.751
Let's go back inside and see
if we can learn anything.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.489
- Thank you.
- Sure.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.393
So, Hype, I just want
to go over everything again

22:40.427 --> 22:44.697
and make sure
that I fully understand.

22:44.731 --> 22:47.900
So you and Eva were involved.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.737
And that's the reason
that you went to the hospital?

22:50.770 --> 22:52.505
To check on her condition?

22:52.539 --> 22:55.608
- Yeah. I mean, I just wanted
to make sure she was okay.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.410
But like I said, I ain't gay.

22:57.444 --> 22:59.145
Not even close.

22:59.178 --> 23:00.480
I just--

23:00.513 --> 23:02.815
you know,
I just like her, that's all.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.418
- So when did you
and Eva first meet?

23:05.452 --> 23:06.218
- Three months ago.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.655
At some party
for some photographer.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.823
We liked each other.
Started hanging out.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.459
- Why'd she slap you?

23:13.626 --> 23:15.495
- 'Cause I pretended
I ain't know her.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.697
Started making
some stupid jokes.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.766
I just ain't want nobody
to know, that's all.

23:19.799 --> 23:22.902
- So this had nothing to do
with the songs she wrote.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.003
- What are you talking about?

23:24.036 --> 23:26.706
- Your boy Cash told us
she wrote some of your tracks,

23:26.739 --> 23:29.208
but you didn't want
her name on the album.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.578
That's why he and Vincent Love
had to give her 50K

23:31.611 --> 23:32.745
to remain anonymous.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.481
- What the hell
are you talking about?

23:34.514 --> 23:36.816
Eva didn't write no tracks.
She don't even like rap.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.951
Look, I write my own rhymes,
from day one, all right?

23:38.985 --> 23:40.887
- Then why were you
at Cypress market?

23:43.623 --> 23:46.459
- Eva wanted to have lunch.

23:46.493 --> 23:48.961
In public.

23:48.995 --> 23:53.733
She was tired of our
relationship being on the DL.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.503
It was a big deal to her.

23:57.504 --> 23:58.605
- And?

24:00.239 --> 24:02.208
- I freaked out.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.511
Changed my mind.

24:04.544 --> 24:10.249
I mean, I wanted to have lunch,
but I just couldn't do it.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.585
So I left.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.787
Went to the bar down the street,

24:14.821 --> 24:17.524
drank some peach schnapps,
and went back to the studio.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.261
- The bartender
at the Golden Goat

24:22.294 --> 24:23.195
says he remembers Hype.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.897
Says he's the first person
in five years

24:24.931 --> 24:26.032
to order peach schnapps.

24:26.065 --> 24:30.202
Surveillance videos show him
there from 12:10 to 1:05.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.739
- Okay, so if Hype didn't do it,
then who did?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.574
The boyfriend, Logan,
is in the clear, right?

24:34.607 --> 24:36.543
- Yeah. The office manager
confirms he was at

24:36.576 --> 24:38.611
the doctor's office
from 12:15 to 1:10.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.513
- So if it wasn't Hype
and it wasn't Logan...

24:40.547 --> 24:41.581
- It's gotta be Cash.

24:41.614 --> 24:43.282
- Okay, so get the mother
and the daughter down here

24:43.315 --> 24:44.884
right away
and see if they can ID him.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.655
- I told you.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.923
I didn't get a good look
at his face.

24:50.957 --> 24:53.259
Neither did Sophie.
Right?

24:54.226 --> 24:55.161
- Keep looking.

24:55.194 --> 24:56.963
You never know
when something might click,

24:56.996 --> 24:58.631
a face might look familiar.

25:04.937 --> 25:06.005
- Sophie.

25:06.038 --> 25:10.810
Are any of those men
the one you saw in the hallway?

25:10.843 --> 25:14.581
- I told you--
- Okay, let her speak.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.616
- Is that the man you saw?

25:16.649 --> 25:18.751
- She didn't see--
- Okay. You know what?

25:18.785 --> 25:21.253
Can I speak to you
in private for a moment?

25:28.695 --> 25:30.563
Look.

25:30.597 --> 25:32.599
I understand that this is hard,

25:32.632 --> 25:34.634
but your daughter needs
to start telling the truth.

25:34.667 --> 25:35.968
- She's not going to testify.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.737
I'm not going to risk her safety
over some--

25:37.770 --> 25:38.938
- Some what?

25:38.971 --> 25:40.239
Some freak?

25:40.272 --> 25:41.340
- She's just a kid.

25:41.373 --> 25:44.744
It's not her fault some man
in a dress got attacked.

25:44.777 --> 25:47.013
- Her name is Eva.
She is an art student.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.015
She lives in Montclair
with her family.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.250
With her parents, Nina and Mark.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.719
The mother
is a fifth-grade teacher

25:52.752 --> 25:54.621
and the father
is an electrician,

25:54.654 --> 25:58.057
and if you continue to interfere
with our investigation

25:58.090 --> 26:00.627
and encourage your daughter
to lie,

26:00.660 --> 26:01.628
I will arrest you.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.630
Am I making myself clear?

26:05.998 --> 26:07.634
Thank you.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.640
- The girl ID'd Cash Lewis.
Is it credible?

26:13.673 --> 26:15.341
- I think so--
when she saw his face

26:15.374 --> 26:17.009
in the photo array,
her eyes lit up,

26:17.043 --> 26:19.612
and she said she remembered
the tattoo on his neck.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.614
It reminded her of SpongeBob.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.816
- Huh.
The motive?

26:23.850 --> 26:27.019
- Look, Eva posed a threat
to Hype's image. His career.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.921
So Cash tried to buy her off.

26:28.955 --> 26:29.989
When she refused,

26:30.022 --> 26:32.892
he beat and raped her
with a pipe.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.894
- I'm not sure we have enough
for an arrest just yet,

26:34.927 --> 26:36.295
but I'll get you
a search warrant.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.597
- Okay.
[phone chimes]

26:40.099 --> 26:41.233
The sooner, the better.

26:41.267 --> 26:45.337
Our rape case just turned into
a murder investigation.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.640
Eva passed away an hour ago.

26:47.674 --> 26:50.342
[dramatic music]

*

26:52.111 --> 26:53.145
[sighs]

27:05.091 --> 27:06.659
- Cash Lewis!

27:06.693 --> 27:09.628
NYPD! We have a warrant!

27:11.731 --> 27:13.365
- I got a body.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.873
- He's still breathing.

27:20.907 --> 27:22.408
- Get a bus in here now!

27:22.441 --> 27:24.643
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

27:31.117 --> 27:31.918
Drop that gun!
Drop it!

27:31.951 --> 27:33.686
- Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

27:33.720 --> 27:36.455
- Don't shoot!
Don't shoot! Please!

27:36.488 --> 27:37.757
- Give me your hands.

27:46.232 --> 27:49.435
- I read over my contract
real thorough last night.

27:49.468 --> 27:52.905
I was supposed to get 20%
of the profits, not 15%.

27:52.939 --> 27:57.710
So I went to see Cash
and we got into it.

27:57.744 --> 28:00.479
- What does that mean?
"Got into it"?

28:00.512 --> 28:02.181
- I said
he was trying to hustle me.

28:02.214 --> 28:05.284
He got pissed off,
started saying some things,

28:05.317 --> 28:06.285
and it got ugly.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.754
- Yeah, and then what?
You hit him?

28:07.787 --> 28:08.755
He hit you?

28:08.788 --> 28:10.222
- He punched me.
In the head.

28:10.256 --> 28:12.024
- Right side?
Left side?

28:12.058 --> 28:14.226
- Right here.
Left side.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.963
- And you hit him back?
- Yeah.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.798
We started swinging
at each other,

28:18.831 --> 28:21.934
and he pulled out his piece,
so I grabbed it.

28:21.968 --> 28:24.303
But he ain't back down,
and he's big and strong,

28:24.336 --> 28:26.505
so he started stepping to me

28:26.538 --> 28:27.907
with this crazy look
in his eyes.

28:29.842 --> 28:31.043
And I was in fear of my life.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.812
I thought he was going
to try to kill me,

28:32.845 --> 28:33.880
so I shot him.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.114
- Nice work.

28:36.115 --> 28:37.183
- Bottom line, Detectives--

28:37.216 --> 28:38.918
Randall was acting
in self-defense.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.220
He's much smaller than Cash,

28:41.253 --> 28:44.256
and despite his tattoos
and his ghetto affectations,

28:44.290 --> 28:45.825
he is an artist.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.827
He's not a fighter.
He's not a gangster.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.829
Cash, on the other hand--
well, let's just say

28:49.862 --> 28:51.898
that there was no pretend
in that man.

28:51.931 --> 28:52.899
- Oh, I agree.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.167
But if Cash was so big and mean,

28:55.201 --> 28:57.870
then how did you win the fight
and get the gun?

28:57.904 --> 28:59.839
- He grabbed it
out of Cash's hand.

28:59.872 --> 29:00.840
- Y-yeah.

29:00.873 --> 29:01.974
He just had it
by his side,

29:02.008 --> 29:03.910
so I snatched it.

29:03.943 --> 29:07.013
- So this whole fight
was over a contract.

29:07.046 --> 29:08.915
Not Eva.
- Correct.

29:08.948 --> 29:12.184
- Even though Eva died
three hours before this fight.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.921
- Even though it was Cash
who killed her.

29:14.954 --> 29:15.855
- That may be the case,

29:15.888 --> 29:17.990
but it has nothing to do
with this dispute.

29:18.024 --> 29:20.759
- Look, I was just there
to talk business, a'ight?

29:22.895 --> 29:24.230
- If that's what you say.

29:24.263 --> 29:25.364
- So,
since this is self-defense,

29:25.397 --> 29:27.800
I assume we have your consent
to take a few photos,

29:27.834 --> 29:30.202
collect your clothing,
clip your fingernails.

29:31.170 --> 29:32.872
- This guy's lying his ass off.

29:32.905 --> 29:34.874
- More like frontin'
his ass off.

29:34.907 --> 29:37.877
- I don't want to charge him.
Not yet.

29:37.910 --> 29:38.710
Dig into his story.

29:38.744 --> 29:40.179
Find out what's true.
What's not.

29:43.315 --> 29:45.918
- Take your clothes off, please.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.854
- Between you and me,

29:47.887 --> 29:50.589
I didn't care too much
for that Cash dude,

29:50.622 --> 29:51.891
so I hope
you're telling the truth

29:51.924 --> 29:53.025
about this contract thing.

29:53.059 --> 29:54.393
I'd hate to see you
go down for murder

29:54.426 --> 29:55.895
behind a stupid lie like that.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.163
- My client's done talking,
Detective.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.397
I thought we were clear on that.

29:59.431 --> 30:00.833
- I'm just trying to help.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.034
- Carisi.

30:05.938 --> 30:09.008
Got a hit on the gun.
It belongs to Vincent Love.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.411
- So Hype used my gun
to shoot Cash?

30:12.444 --> 30:13.880
He must've stolen it.

30:13.913 --> 30:15.314
He knows I own many guns, man.

30:15.347 --> 30:16.983
- What, you just keep 'em
out in the open?

30:17.016 --> 30:18.851
- Nope. I keep
everything locked up,

30:18.885 --> 30:21.954
but I always keep one right here
in my desk.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.592
Oops.
At least I thought I did.

30:26.625 --> 30:28.394
- Did Hype know
that you kept a gun in there?

30:28.427 --> 30:30.930
- Of course he did.
That's how he stole it.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.098
- If you say so.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.201
When was the last time
Hype was here?

30:35.234 --> 30:36.936
- Today.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.905
From 3:20 to 3:43.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.439
I was downstairs
with the doormen

30:40.472 --> 30:41.941
looking over the video.

30:41.974 --> 30:42.774
- Yeah.

30:42.808 --> 30:45.611
He was here
playing me his new album.

30:45.644 --> 30:46.612
He was excited about it.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.614
- Do you know anything
about some kind of beef

30:48.647 --> 30:49.415
between Hype and Cash?

30:49.448 --> 30:52.084
- No. Like you boys,
they were tight.

30:52.118 --> 30:54.220
- What about Eva?
- Who?

30:54.253 --> 30:56.155
- The lady you had kicked out
of the party last week.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.958
- Her?
Or should I say, him?

30:58.991 --> 31:01.060
- No, you got it right
the first time. Her.

31:02.128 --> 31:03.930
- Why is she even relevant
to this?

31:03.963 --> 31:07.934
- Because she and Hype
were involved. Romantically.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.668
That's why you cut her
that 50G check,

31:09.701 --> 31:11.037
so she would go away.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.238
Didn't want her
to screw up his career

31:12.271 --> 31:13.639
before it even got started.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.307
- But when she said no,
Cash went next-level.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.343
Beat her with a pipe.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.278
- I don't know nothing
about it, bro.

31:19.311 --> 31:22.381
But look, if y'all need
any other information,

31:22.414 --> 31:24.116
y'all call my lawyer.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.484
Y'all have a nice day.

31:25.517 --> 31:28.654
[tense music]

31:28.687 --> 31:31.924
*

31:31.958 --> 31:35.161
- This whole self-defense thing
is a total mess.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.930
First and foremost,
Cash didn't pull the gun.

31:37.964 --> 31:38.730
Hype did.

31:38.764 --> 31:40.266
The kid is lying
about everything.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.268
- To avoid admitting
that he was in love with Eva.

31:42.301 --> 31:45.004
- Even if he tells the truth--

31:45.037 --> 31:48.040
that he was seeking revenge
because of Eva's death--

31:48.074 --> 31:49.976
he could still be
staring down a murder charge.

31:50.009 --> 31:50.909
- Look, the guy finds out

31:50.943 --> 31:53.012
that the love of his life
has just died

31:53.045 --> 31:55.114
after being beaten and raped
with a pipe.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.416
I mean, it sounds like
heat of the moment to me.

31:57.449 --> 32:00.486
- No. He had three hours
to cool down.

32:00.519 --> 32:02.421
He stole Vincent Love's gun.

32:02.454 --> 32:06.025
Then he drove 60 blocks
looking for his victim,

32:06.058 --> 32:07.726
and he shot him in cold blood.

32:07.759 --> 32:08.760
To me, that sounds like murder.

32:08.794 --> 32:12.031
- Well, if the victim wasn't
such a hate-filled,

32:12.064 --> 32:13.032
pipe-wielding rapist,

32:13.065 --> 32:15.001
then I'd be more inclined
to agree with you.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.136
- From a legal perspective,
that's irrelevant.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.138
- I know,
but from a human one, it's not.

32:19.171 --> 32:22.208
Cash killed Eva
because she was transgender.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.043
Is the world really
gonna be a worse place

32:24.076 --> 32:27.413
because Hype does 5 years
instead of 20?

32:30.082 --> 32:32.118
[door opens]

32:32.151 --> 32:34.053
- We're going to indict you
for murder

32:34.086 --> 32:35.054
first thing tomorrow.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.455
- Randall acted
in self-defense.

32:36.488 --> 32:39.158
- Mmm. We disagree.
The evidence doesn't add up.

32:39.191 --> 32:41.994
But the good news is I'm here
to offer you a deal, sir.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.295
Man One.

32:44.263 --> 32:47.033
I will, however,
need you to allocute

32:47.066 --> 32:49.068
so that the judge
and the public knows

32:49.101 --> 32:50.336
why I'm offering you
such a good deal.

32:50.369 --> 32:51.570
- What's that mean?

32:51.603 --> 32:55.007
- That means you need to tell
the judge what really happened:

32:55.041 --> 32:55.874
that you killed Cash

32:55.907 --> 32:59.378
in a heightened,
emotional fit of rage

32:59.411 --> 33:01.180
because you loved Eva.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.784
- This ain't got nothing to do
with nobody named Eva.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.587
- Okay, Hype.
Don't be stupid.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.756
- I shot Cash
over a business dispute!

33:10.789 --> 33:12.258
In self-defense!

33:13.592 --> 33:16.128
Like I said,

33:16.162 --> 33:18.330
I ain't no faggot.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.341
- That kid thinks,

33:29.375 --> 33:31.077
because he's in love
with a transgender woman,

33:31.110 --> 33:32.078
that he's gay.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.079
He's confused.

33:33.112 --> 33:33.879
- Well, we tried.

33:33.912 --> 33:35.547
It was a good deal.
Almost too good.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.549
Either the guy has got a lot
of confidence in his lawyer--

33:37.583 --> 33:38.584
- Or he's being handled.

33:38.617 --> 33:41.153
That lawyer is in
Vincent Love's back pocket.

33:41.187 --> 33:44.423
Any time one of his rappers
gets jammed up,

33:44.456 --> 33:45.557
good old Hampton gets a call.

33:45.591 --> 33:47.559
- So?
- "So?"

33:47.593 --> 33:50.096
So the real client
is Vincent Love, not Hype.

33:50.129 --> 33:51.497
- He's allowed
to pay the legal fees

33:51.530 --> 33:53.099
as long as there's
no conflict of interest.

33:53.132 --> 33:53.999
- No conflict?

33:54.032 --> 33:56.102
He just talked Hype
out of the best deal

33:56.135 --> 33:57.836
that he is ever going to see,

33:57.869 --> 34:00.139
because he's protecting
Love's brand.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.541
They're transphobic,
homophobic,

34:02.574 --> 34:04.676
and if they have to sell
Hype out in the meantime--

34:04.710 --> 34:06.178
you know,
convince him to stay street--

34:06.212 --> 34:07.513
so be it.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.781
- I don't disagree,
but it's not my problem.

34:09.815 --> 34:10.782
I've got a trial to win.

34:10.816 --> 34:11.883
- Look.

34:11.917 --> 34:14.386
I think Vincent Love
orchestrated the attack on Eva.

34:14.420 --> 34:16.688
- Oh, you're not gonna let me
get out of here.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.658
- He's the one who had Eva
thrown out of that party.

34:19.691 --> 34:21.560
He told Cash to pay her off.

34:21.593 --> 34:24.463
When she refused,
he told Cash to beat her.

34:24.496 --> 34:25.697
- Go on.

34:25.731 --> 34:27.233
- Vincent Love
has too much to lose.

34:27.266 --> 34:28.767
Hype was supposed to be
the next big thing.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.569
His golden goose.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.671
He has the looks,
the talent,

34:32.704 --> 34:33.839
the attitude.

34:33.872 --> 34:37.809
The only thing that could
possibly screw that up was Eva.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.645
- Liv, it's a little late
in the game for this,

34:39.678 --> 34:40.779
don't you think?

34:40.812 --> 34:41.780
Do you have any evidence

34:41.813 --> 34:43.215
anything at all,
to back this up?

34:43.249 --> 34:44.082
- No.

34:44.116 --> 34:46.685
- Well, then,
you got to let it go.

34:46.718 --> 34:48.154
Or find some, fast.

34:48.187 --> 34:50.822
- So you will get me a warrant
for Love's office?

34:50.856 --> 34:51.857
His studio?

34:51.890 --> 34:55.161
- Yes.
- Thank you.

34:59.498 --> 35:00.832
- I told you
we are not ready to plead

35:00.866 --> 35:02.701
to any charge
that is gonna force my client

35:02.734 --> 35:04.703
to lie about
some fictitious relationship

35:04.736 --> 35:06.838
with a transgender art student.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.508
- We all know
that it's not fictitious.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.710
And so does Vincent Love,
your boss.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.246
We've been searching his texts,
his emails, his studio,

35:14.280 --> 35:15.914
but you...
you already knew that.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.549
- Is there a point
to this meeting,

35:17.583 --> 35:19.718
or are you guys
just really bored?

35:19.751 --> 35:21.687
- Here's the point, smartass.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.590
- Homey gotta move off
this tranny thing.

35:24.623 --> 35:25.724
Ain't good for business.

35:25.757 --> 35:26.725
- I know.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.260
But Hype don't listen.

35:28.294 --> 35:31.630
- So make the tranny listen
instead.

35:32.631 --> 35:33.865
- That audio,
courtesy of Vincent Love

35:33.899 --> 35:35.100
and the now-departed Cash Lewis,

35:35.133 --> 35:38.670
was recorded two days before
Eva was attacked with a pipe.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.172
- Those damn hot mics.

35:40.206 --> 35:41.673
You never know
what you're gonna hear.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.542
- That conversation
proves nothing.

35:43.575 --> 35:45.311
- It does
if your client testifies.

35:45.344 --> 35:46.945
If he tells the jury

35:46.978 --> 35:48.780
that Vincent Love and Cash Lewis

35:48.814 --> 35:51.183
were urging him to break off
his romance with Eva.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.784
- Cash may have attacked Eva,

35:52.818 --> 35:53.952
but that is all over
and done with,

35:53.985 --> 35:55.954
and Vincent had nothing
to do with it.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.756
- That sounds
like a conflict of interest.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.591
I'd much rather bury
the man responsible

35:59.625 --> 36:00.659
for killing Eva
than you.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.794
If you cooperate,
I'll reduce the murder charge.

36:02.828 --> 36:03.729
To Man Two.
You'll do three years.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.797
- We've already discussed this.
- Hold on.

36:05.831 --> 36:06.698
Why don't you let
your client talk?

36:06.732 --> 36:08.867
- It is not his job to talk.
It's mine.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.703
- Then why don't you speak
on his behalf for once?

36:13.639 --> 36:14.740
Hype.

36:14.773 --> 36:19.745
Cash and Love told you
that Eva would ruin your career,

36:19.778 --> 36:21.613
and when
she wouldn't accept the money,

36:21.647 --> 36:23.649
they killed her--
- I know what they did.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.650
Trust me.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.652
- Well, then, testify.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.787
Get justice for Eva.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.223
Doesn't she deserve that?

36:31.257 --> 36:33.692
Do it for her.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.794
- Look, I can't do this, man.
- Don't look at him.

36:35.827 --> 36:38.864
This is your decision,
not his.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.703
We're giving you
an opportunity here,

36:44.736 --> 36:47.839
and if you lose this case,

36:47.873 --> 36:49.007
it'll be you doing 20 years.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.309
Not Hampton.

36:50.342 --> 36:52.744
Not Love.
You.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.615
They'll be out walking free.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.551
Making money
on the music that you wrote.

36:59.585 --> 37:02.388
[tense music]

37:02.421 --> 37:08.760
*

37:08.794 --> 37:10.929
- I ain't no snitch.

37:12.298 --> 37:14.333
See you in court.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.979
- At 3:00--
the defendant learned

37:28.013 --> 37:32.784
that his girlfriend,
Eva Carson, had died

37:32.818 --> 37:36.388
from injuries sustained
during a vicious sexual assault.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.724
About 20 minutes later,

37:38.757 --> 37:42.394
he stole a handgun from his
business associate's home.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.863
He hailed a cab, drove uptown--

37:44.896 --> 37:46.865
approximately some,
what, 60 blocks--

37:46.898 --> 37:48.867
to kill the man responsible
for Eva's death--

37:48.900 --> 37:50.902
Cash Lewis.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.772
Revenge is a natural,
primal emotion.

37:53.805 --> 37:55.441
We've all felt the urge
to right a wrong,

37:55.474 --> 37:57.309
but in a modern,
civilized society,

37:57.343 --> 37:59.378
there is no place
for vigilante justice,

37:59.411 --> 38:02.814
so whether or not Cash Lewis
is responsible for Eva's death,

38:02.848 --> 38:06.352
what the defendant did
constitutes murder

38:06.385 --> 38:08.387
under New York law.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.999
- My client, Randall Leonard,

38:21.032 --> 38:24.703
is a rising star
in the music industry.

38:24.736 --> 38:28.807
He's a gifted, raw,
authentic artist

38:28.840 --> 38:31.377
with insights into
the postmodern urban existence.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.812
- Is this an opening argument
or an advertisement?

38:33.845 --> 38:35.914
- Randall has worked
his whole life

38:35.947 --> 38:37.449
to become a successful artist--

38:37.483 --> 38:39.985
to make enough money
to help his mother,

38:40.018 --> 38:41.887
his brothers and sisters--

38:41.920 --> 38:44.122
so when he discovered
that his friend

38:44.155 --> 38:45.924
and business partner,
Cash Lewis,

38:45.957 --> 38:47.959
was trying
to take advantage of him

38:47.993 --> 38:50.796
by coercing him
into signing an unfair contract,

38:50.829 --> 38:52.898
he confronted him.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.800
They fought.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.902
Cash pulled a gun.

38:56.935 --> 39:01.940
Randall grabbed it
and shot Cash in self-defense.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.410
This case has nothing to do

39:04.443 --> 39:05.977
with love

39:06.011 --> 39:09.981
or some fictitious relationship
with someone named Eva.

39:10.015 --> 39:13.919
That is simply a convenient
and imagined narrative

39:13.952 --> 39:15.954
the prosecution concocted
to help justify

39:15.987 --> 39:19.124
this baseless murder case.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.695
- So your fatal argument
with Cash Lewis

39:23.729 --> 39:25.931
was all about a contract--
it was a business dispute.

39:25.964 --> 39:28.066
- Right. Cash screwed me.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.001
That's how
this whole thing started.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.069
- Even though
the contract had been signed

39:31.102 --> 39:32.438
two months before the argument.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.540
- Yes.
- And so help me out here.

39:34.573 --> 39:35.741
If the contract was so unfair,

39:35.774 --> 39:38.510
then why did you email him
on the day you signed it and say

39:38.544 --> 39:40.979
"Thank you for hooking me up
with this sweet-ass deal"?

39:41.012 --> 39:42.848
- 'Cause I ain't read it
close enough.

39:42.881 --> 39:44.483
- But you did read it
close enough two months later?

39:44.516 --> 39:46.518
- Yes.

39:46.552 --> 39:49.888
- So what made you decide
to reexamine the contract?

39:49.921 --> 39:51.857
Legal curiosity?
Boredom?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.959
- What do you mean?
- It's Wednesday.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.961
You're in the middle of working
on a new album,

39:55.994 --> 39:57.896
and all of a sudden, you decide
to print up the contract

39:57.929 --> 40:00.532
and analyze its legal nuances?

40:00.566 --> 40:03.469
- I-I just wanted to make sure
it made sense, that's all.

40:03.502 --> 40:05.471
- So it's all about
the contract.

40:05.504 --> 40:06.538
- Yeah.

40:06.572 --> 40:07.939
- It had nothing to do
with the fact

40:07.973 --> 40:10.476
that a woman named Eva
had just died

40:10.509 --> 40:14.079
after being raped and beaten
with a metal pipe.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.522
- She got nothing to do
with this.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.491
- Can't you just tell the truth?

40:25.524 --> 40:26.558
You shot the son of a bitch

40:26.592 --> 40:28.927
who raped and murdered
the woman of your dreams--

40:28.960 --> 40:30.996
on the order of Vincent Love...

40:32.831 --> 40:34.500
Just because
she was transgender.

40:34.533 --> 40:36.034
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

40:36.067 --> 40:38.069
Nothing further.

40:46.011 --> 40:48.947
- Has the jury reached
a verdict?

40:48.980 --> 40:51.817
- We have, Your Honor.
- What say you?

40:53.284 --> 40:56.121
- On the charge of murder
in the second degree,

40:56.154 --> 40:58.023
we find the defendant guilty.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.892
- The court would like to thank
the members of the jury

41:00.926 --> 41:02.794
for their time and service.

41:02.828 --> 41:05.997
[dramatic music]

41:06.031 --> 41:13.071
*

41:28.286 --> 41:30.956
- Three lives destroyed--

41:30.989 --> 41:35.994
all because some woman named Eva
was born a boy.

41:39.097 --> 41:42.267
- I just read
Hype's single hit number one.

41:44.570 --> 41:46.605
- That's all
that really matters.
