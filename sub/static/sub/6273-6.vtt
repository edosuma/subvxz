WEBVTT

00:00.066 --> 00:01.233
Virginia:  <i>Previously on</i>
<i>"masters of sex"...</i>

00:01.235 --> 00:04.370
It's the key to your
new office at
buell green.

00:04.471 --> 00:06.171
They fully endorsed
the study

00:06.173 --> 00:08.974
And my bringing
you aboard.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.410
Cyril: After the
dust-up yesterday,

00:11.412 --> 00:13.712
I thought it would be
best if we kept
our patients

00:13.714 --> 00:15.214
Away from each other.

00:15.216 --> 00:15.781
My god.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.416
Gene: So, uh, you guys
are friends from, uh?

00:17.418 --> 00:19.118
Acquaintances, really.
Oh, we go way back.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.919
I really think
al would love helen.

00:20.921 --> 00:23.288
Unless, of course,
you have
a special someone?

00:23.290 --> 00:25.524
No, I was
recently jilted.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.860
Lillian: I'm never going back
to that hospital.

00:27.862 --> 00:30.129
It would be irresponsible
to stay on.

00:30.131 --> 00:32.631
I am scared, though,
for what's ahead.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.000
He is a rough customer...
Robin.

00:35.002 --> 00:36.435
And he does
have a temper.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.503
But when it's late...

00:37.505 --> 00:39.471
And it's just
the two of us...

00:39.473 --> 00:43.008
Alone in our bed,
well...

00:43.076 --> 00:45.911
I'm sure you can understand
how hard that is to leave.

00:45.913 --> 00:47.813
Why did
he break your nose?

00:47.815 --> 00:48.547
I don't remember.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.315
And there was
no one there
to stop it?

00:50.317 --> 00:52.818
Oh, I... I could
have stopped it.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.586
I took it.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.188
Like a man.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.389
Man: You a fight fan?

00:57.391 --> 00:58.424
Virginia: Not really.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.759
Then what
brings you here?

01:02.896 --> 01:05.597
I want to see
how it ends.

01:07.934 --> 01:10.135
(theme music playing)

01:56.516 --> 01:58.150
(sighs)

02:00.053 --> 02:03.555
(both panting)

02:13.366 --> 02:15.901
I could kiss you now.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.970
We don't kiss.

02:18.571 --> 02:20.339
No. Don't move.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.040
(groans) I want to.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.408
No.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.043
(sighs)

02:25.512 --> 02:27.779
Don't move.

02:28.615 --> 02:29.781
(sighs)

02:29.783 --> 02:31.817
Man: Don't move.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.355
(switch clicks)

02:36.357 --> 02:38.290
Man: You're moving.

02:39.692 --> 02:41.460
I have a sunburn.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.662
Radiation burn
from last time.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.396
Mmm-hmm.

02:44.398 --> 02:46.965
And it itches,
which is why I moved.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.400
I'm sorry. What?

02:48.402 --> 02:51.270
Sunburn.
Ah. Yes.

02:51.272 --> 02:51.870
Common side effect.

02:51.872 --> 02:55.007
We can prescribe
a topical cream.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.610
And nausea.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.379
And fatigue.

03:00.381 --> 03:03.749
I do have reduced
cognitive function.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.752
Losing words and weight.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.254
And hair.

03:09.256 --> 03:10.656
Don't move.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.591
Thank you
for your concern.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.861
Your lack of interest
is rather liberating,
actually.

03:15.863 --> 03:20.632
I could likely say anything
to you and you wouldn't blink.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.302
I was raised by vampires.

03:23.304 --> 03:26.638
I drive getaway cars
in my spare time.

03:26.640 --> 03:29.942
I once had
intercourse
with a corpse.

03:33.780 --> 03:34.646
Then look again, please.

03:34.648 --> 03:37.015
It's much better
for me to take her
in the mornings.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.917
Well, then, perhaps
you can find someone else

03:38.919 --> 03:39.851
To bring her.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.753
I mean
that it's much
better for her.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.855
By the afternoon,
she's very tired,

03:43.857 --> 03:45.357
So perhaps you
have a patient

03:45.359 --> 03:48.126
Who prefers
taking an
afternoon slot.

03:48.128 --> 03:48.794
You aren't proposing

03:48.796 --> 03:50.462
I ask someone
to move their
appointment

03:50.464 --> 03:52.764
In order to accommodate
your friend, are you?

03:52.766 --> 03:53.498
Virginia, let's just go.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.167
What you may
be unaware of,
priscilla,

03:55.169 --> 03:58.437
Is the fact
that my friend
is also a doctor.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.705
I can come in
the afternoons.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.039
And I would like to
think that you
would be glad

04:01.041 --> 04:02.741
To extend to
dr. Depaul...

04:02.743 --> 04:03.375
Mariel: Virginia.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.978
The same professional
courtesy that...
It's me. Mariel.

04:05.980 --> 04:08.046
Oh, you don't
recognize me
because...

04:08.048 --> 04:10.115
Ta-da...
I'm down two sizes.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.516
Look...
Loosey goosey.

04:11.518 --> 04:12.284
Don't you
look wonderful.

04:12.286 --> 04:15.254
Virginia introduced me
to the most wonderful
diet program.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.622
And priscilla here
was having trouble

04:16.624 --> 04:18.156
Finding us
a morning
appointment.

04:18.158 --> 04:21.260
Virginia,
take the afternoon slot.
Sign us out of here.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.495
Yes, since I told you
mornings next week

04:23.497 --> 04:24.529
Are completely booked.

04:24.531 --> 04:25.664
Completely?
(chuckles)

04:25.666 --> 04:28.166
This is why we call you
"priscilla the hun."

04:28.168 --> 04:30.502
We do.
It's not even a secret.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.337
Uh, I'll see
if mrs. Marmo

04:32.339 --> 04:34.773
Is willing to switch
her 10:00 a.M.
On Wednesday.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.974
Does that work for you,
virginia?

04:35.976 --> 04:37.509
That would be
wonderful.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.745
Thank you so much.

04:40.747 --> 04:44.549
You just can't take no
for an answer, can you?

04:46.052 --> 04:49.354
As you can see,
we screen
very thoroughly.

04:49.356 --> 04:52.824
We do an intake
with you first,
of course.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.893
It's impressive.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.928
Guess what I'm wondering...

04:56.930 --> 04:59.464
Um, my question is...

04:59.999 --> 05:02.200
You can ask me anything.

05:02.202 --> 05:06.004
Well, sometimes,
in the bedroom,
I mean, with roger...

05:06.006 --> 05:06.805
That's my husband...

05:06.807 --> 05:11.777
I wonder if different ways
of being intimate
would produce...

05:11.779 --> 05:13.845
Different results?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.647
Well, first of all,
we would be happy

05:15.649 --> 05:19.051
To have both you
and your husband
as participants

05:19.053 --> 05:20.719
In the study together,

05:20.721 --> 05:22.120
And I could see to it

05:22.122 --> 05:23.689
That you could
experiment

05:23.691 --> 05:24.823
With different
sexual positions,

05:24.825 --> 05:28.560
Which is I think
what you're
trying to say.

05:29.228 --> 05:30.262
I wish I could do this.

05:30.264 --> 05:33.398
You can.
It's completely
anonymous.

05:33.400 --> 05:33.932
Your husband...

05:33.934 --> 05:35.867
It's not my husband.
It's dr. Hendricks.

05:35.869 --> 05:36.935
I'm sorry?

05:36.937 --> 05:39.271
Dr. Hendricks
has forbidden staff

05:39.273 --> 05:41.073
From participating
in the study.

05:41.075 --> 05:42.574
I mean forbidden.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.911
So, as much
as I'd like to

05:45.913 --> 05:47.279
(sighs)

05:47.281 --> 05:49.481
Can't lose my job.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.149
Virginia: You should have
leveled with us.

05:51.151 --> 05:53.919
Instead of ripping down
our fliers in the
dead of night.

05:53.921 --> 05:56.321
I removed them
in broad daylight.

05:56.323 --> 05:56.855
You promised me

05:56.857 --> 05:58.857
Our study had
your full backing
and support.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.492
I did allow your study
to come to this hospital,

06:00.494 --> 06:04.363
But I assumed you'd
bring your own subjects...
White subjects.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.965
White subjects only!

06:09.202 --> 06:10.902
Wait here.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.973
Why is your staff
not allowed to
participate?

06:14.975 --> 06:16.675
Bad idea.
According to whom?

06:16.677 --> 06:17.709
Charles,
if your intention

06:17.711 --> 06:20.112
Is to move
history forward,
as you put it to me,

06:20.114 --> 06:22.514
You better come up
with a better reason
than that,

06:22.516 --> 06:24.149
Otherwise you are a man
spouting revolution

06:24.151 --> 06:27.919
While in reality,
you're just toeing
the party line.

06:27.921 --> 06:30.922
No doubt there's a gurney
waiting for you somewhere.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.457
Find it.

06:37.196 --> 06:38.096
You're not familiar

06:38.098 --> 06:39.898
With the history
of medical research

06:39.900 --> 06:41.767
In the negro community.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.001
Why, if you mean...

06:43.003 --> 06:44.770
I mean negroes forced
to undergo

06:44.772 --> 06:46.405
Risky experimental
surgeries,

06:46.407 --> 06:47.906
Dosed with radiation,

06:47.908 --> 06:50.008
Cut open to find
brain abnormalities

06:50.010 --> 06:53.912
Which could explain
their propensity
to violence.

06:53.914 --> 06:54.513
I have heard...

06:54.515 --> 06:57.716
You've heard
that negroes have
been thought to require

06:57.718 --> 06:59.918
Near lethal doses
of x-rays to

06:59.920 --> 07:02.020
Penetrate their skin.

07:02.022 --> 07:04.456
And now we have
you and miss johnson,

07:04.458 --> 07:05.157
Two white researchers,

07:05.159 --> 07:10.562
Who wish to
watch through glass
as negroes copulate.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.731
In our study,
subjects understand

07:12.733 --> 07:13.865
The parameters
of their participation.

07:13.867 --> 07:17.602
They know exactly
what is expected
of him or her and why.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.271
But the impression, bill.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.541
The associations
the good people
of this community

07:22.543 --> 07:23.942
Have with
their hospital...

07:23.944 --> 07:26.445
Your staff
already wants
to sign up.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.346
Several of them
would participate today

07:28.348 --> 07:29.147
If you weren't
forbidding it.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.583
Most of my staff
has never seen
a lynching.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.151
I have. Have you?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.253
No.
Did you know
most of the times

07:35.255 --> 07:39.424
They castrate
a man before they
string him up?

07:39.426 --> 07:41.726
Why do you
think that is?

07:43.663 --> 07:45.564
Fear... I suppose,

07:45.566 --> 07:46.965
Based on erroneous
stereotypes,

07:46.967 --> 07:50.469
Stereotypes
a study like ours
could begin to dispel.

07:50.471 --> 07:51.636
Bill, trust me
when I tell you

07:51.638 --> 07:54.539
You have stepped
into something
you do not understand.

07:54.541 --> 07:58.109
Already it's creating
more of a headache
for me than I need.

07:58.111 --> 07:58.743
Just this morning,

07:58.745 --> 08:01.680
A journalist from a local
negro paper was in my office

08:01.682 --> 08:03.381
Wanting to verify
the shocking rumor

08:03.383 --> 08:04.716
That buell green
was embarking

08:04.718 --> 08:06.985
On a groundbreaking,
top-secret study

08:06.987 --> 08:09.654
Exploring
negro sexuality.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.556
But is that not
moving history forward,

08:11.558 --> 08:14.960
The very thing
you implored me
to do?

08:14.962 --> 08:16.928
We'll move
history forward.

08:16.930 --> 08:17.496
Mark my words.

08:17.498 --> 08:21.500
We just won't do it
by burning my hospital
to the ground.

08:23.202 --> 08:27.372
Now, if you don't mind,
I came in here to take a leak.

08:27.374 --> 08:30.208
Unless you'd like to watch.

08:34.714 --> 08:37.849
Uh, let's, uh,
start with
shrimp cocktail

08:37.851 --> 08:41.086
And then
steak and lobster
for the main part.

08:41.088 --> 08:45.824
Uh, and then
how about hot fudge
sundaes for dessert?

08:45.826 --> 08:46.858
You can do hot fudge?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.426
Anything is possible,
madam.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.428
All right.
Banana splits.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.696
Mmm-hmm.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.699
The more you care,
the more you spend, right?

08:54.701 --> 08:56.201
(chuckles)

08:56.203 --> 08:57.869
Ooh, what about
an ice sculpture?

08:57.871 --> 09:01.273
We could do a swan.
I don't want a swan.

09:08.514 --> 09:11.082
That's the most words
you've said in
a row all day.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.584
Betty, I...
I'm watching you,

09:12.586 --> 09:14.819
And it's like
you're killing yourself
over all this stuff.

09:14.821 --> 09:15.854
Yeah, well,
your pretzels

09:15.856 --> 09:17.222
Are going
into every food fair
in the country.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.492
I mean, gene, honey,
it's not every day
a man is syncopated.

09:20.494 --> 09:21.393
Syndicated.
Yeah, syndicated.

09:21.395 --> 09:24.029
And I want you
to know I appreciate
all this.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.731
It's very sweet
of you. It is.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.266
(sighs)

09:28.268 --> 09:29.768
But?

09:31.537 --> 09:33.038
(sighs)

09:33.040 --> 09:35.307
I've been thinking.

09:35.908 --> 09:36.908
And?

09:36.910 --> 09:37.943
And the idea

09:37.945 --> 09:41.179
That we're not
gonna be able to
have kids of our own...

09:41.181 --> 09:43.682
It's been really tough.

09:43.883 --> 09:44.516
I admit that.

09:44.518 --> 09:49.854
So I've been trying
to get used to the
idea of adopting, and...

09:51.591 --> 09:53.592
I just... I can't.

09:53.594 --> 09:58.763
I wanted our kids
to be you...
Part you, anyway.

09:58.765 --> 09:59.397
And when I realize

09:59.399 --> 10:02.367
How much I want to
see you in those
little faces...

10:02.369 --> 10:03.435
(sighs)

10:03.437 --> 10:06.905
It always led me
back to you.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.608
(chuckles)

10:09.610 --> 10:10.342
I'm sorry.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.377
That... That had
too many "you"s in it.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.378
Hey.
It's... It's okay.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.581
You're enough.
That's why
I'm trying to say.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.183
It's not like
you don't frustrate
the hell out of me,

10:18.185 --> 10:20.819
'cause half the time,
I want to wring your neck.

10:20.821 --> 10:21.319
(chuckles)

10:21.321 --> 10:24.422
But as long
as I'm yours
and you're mine...

10:24.424 --> 10:26.925
That's enough for me.

10:43.442 --> 10:45.477
Uh, dinner
is in 15 minutes.

10:45.479 --> 10:46.778
You were saying
something about
hendricks?

10:46.780 --> 10:50.415
About his, uh,
not wanting negroes
in the study?

10:50.417 --> 10:52.217
Hendricks doesn't.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.385
But he's wrong.

10:53.387 --> 10:55.620
And he knows he's wrong.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.389
Why would
he say it, then?

10:57.391 --> 10:58.690
He's scared.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.426
'cause it's dangerous
for him.

11:01.428 --> 11:06.531
Because all taboos
feel dangerous
until they're broken.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.400
Apparently
there's a negro
journalist

11:08.402 --> 11:10.835
Who is interested
in the study being
at buell green.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.671
We're trying to find
this journalist.

11:12.673 --> 11:17.275
Once we can
convince him of
the value of the work

11:17.277 --> 11:18.643
And he writes as much,

11:18.645 --> 11:20.412
Then what choice
does hendricks have

11:20.414 --> 11:24.215
But to bless
negro participation
in the study?

11:25.785 --> 11:27.118
What are you doing?

11:27.120 --> 11:30.388
Oh, I'm just (chuckles)
I don't know.

11:30.390 --> 11:30.889
I...

11:30.891 --> 11:34.726
Every night, I wonder
if they put on this
show just for me.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.830
Every night,
you watch them?

11:39.098 --> 11:40.498
No, not every night.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.501
But the situation does...
It does concern me.

11:43.503 --> 11:47.605
You're staring at them
like some peeping tom.

11:47.607 --> 11:49.441
I'm not a...
And what about you,

11:49.443 --> 11:52.444
Standing here proposing
to do the exact same thing...

11:52.446 --> 11:53.278
Stare at negroes.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.113
At a hospital
in a study.

11:55.115 --> 11:59.350
Oh, and because
it's for science,
it's not the same thing?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.721
I don't feel safe.

12:02.922 --> 12:04.756
They haven't
done anything.

12:04.758 --> 12:09.094
Libby, either you change
the situation or I will,

12:09.096 --> 12:11.096
Because this...

12:13.966 --> 12:16.267
This needs
to stop.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.144
(indistinct conversations)

12:26.146 --> 12:28.580
(telephone rings)

12:28.582 --> 12:29.280
Excuse me, ma'am.

12:29.282 --> 12:33.118
Dr. Franklin's patients
it on that side of
the waiting room.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.353
I'm here to see
dr. Masters.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.088
I'm virginia johnson.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.323
I'm dr. Masters'
research assistant.

12:38.325 --> 12:41.493
Are you here
as a patient or
for the study?

12:41.495 --> 12:45.063
I'm morgan hogue
from the
<i>st. Louis chronicle.</i>

12:45.065 --> 12:47.732
I understand
you've been
looking for me.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.434
Yeah... Yes.
We have.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.936
Please come with me.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.272
(moaning)

12:55.007 --> 12:56.141
(coughs)

12:56.143 --> 12:58.676
Oh! Oh, my god!

12:58.678 --> 13:00.044
(sighs heavily)

13:00.046 --> 13:03.014
Oh, my god.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.616
I missed you.

13:04.618 --> 13:08.586
I knew you couldn't
stay away forever.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.156
The flesh is weak.

13:11.357 --> 13:15.493
The course of true love
never did run smooth.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.730
All of the above.

13:26.505 --> 13:27.405
You're staying.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.441
I mean,
are you staying?

13:31.177 --> 13:33.745
I...Am...

13:33.747 --> 13:37.048
I can stay
a little longer.

13:41.253 --> 13:44.355
I got to go back
to work anyway.

13:46.392 --> 13:49.661
Knock it off.
Mrs. Mendel is coming.

13:52.298 --> 13:55.066
Mrs. Mendel's
not dead yet?

13:55.301 --> 13:58.036
Probably wishes she were.

13:58.038 --> 14:01.206
Harry stepping out on her.
I'm sure that...

14:01.208 --> 14:05.877
Something
with white roses
that keeps coming up.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.146
Poor mrs. Mendel.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.349
She loves her husband.

14:12.484 --> 14:14.986
He loves someone else.

14:20.092 --> 14:21.659
Hey.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.895
Why don't we, uh...

14:23.897 --> 14:26.865
Why don't we get you
an apartment?

14:26.867 --> 14:28.900
Move you out of here.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.935
You know, two rooms,

14:30.937 --> 14:33.004
Maybe a balcony
overlooking the river.

14:33.006 --> 14:33.805
Would you like that?

14:33.807 --> 14:38.676
There's no reason
that the two of us can't see
each other all the time.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.179
You know,
a lot of the time.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.382
You could hang up
this nonsense with al,

14:44.384 --> 14:47.652
And we could
just be together.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.889
So you stay married,
and I'm your what?

14:50.891 --> 14:52.523
Your mistress?

14:52.525 --> 14:55.226
(scoffs)
that's a
silly thing to say.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.029
That's not
what you're
proposing?

14:59.231 --> 15:00.164
Men have mistresses.

15:00.166 --> 15:04.569
This is a new start.
For us.

15:04.870 --> 15:07.739
We... We have money
for the first time ever.

15:07.741 --> 15:08.539
No, you and gene
have money.

15:08.541 --> 15:12.277
The three of us have
money, and money
means options.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.546
Yeah, with me
as your piece on
the side.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.915
(sighs) honey...

15:16.917 --> 15:21.686
You and me,
we were never gonna have
the white picket fence ever.

15:21.688 --> 15:25.990
So... If an
unconventional life

15:25.992 --> 15:28.226
Was always
in the cards,

15:28.228 --> 15:32.764
Then this
unconventional life...
It's a pretty good one.

15:33.198 --> 15:35.934
Mrs. Mendel
will be here
any minute.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.403
You should get dressed.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.941
Jim crow would
certainly feel at home
in your waiting room.

15:42.943 --> 15:45.610
Believe it or not,
it was actually
the negro doctor

15:45.612 --> 15:48.680
That insisted upon keeping
our patients separated.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.315
And now hendricks
won't allow

15:50.317 --> 15:51.883
His own staff
in the study?

15:51.885 --> 15:52.884
I'm glad you
tracked me down.

15:52.886 --> 15:54.118
Well, hendricks
wants to maintain

15:54.120 --> 15:58.189
The mantle
of respectability
here at buell green.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.625
Yet we believe
the negro community
here

16:00.627 --> 16:02.827
Could actually
benefit from
our study.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.696
Your study
might also
help dispel

16:04.698 --> 16:07.966
Some of those stereotypes
about negro sexuality.

16:07.968 --> 16:10.068
Our point to
hendricks exactly.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.870
So are you saying
this is the reason
you came to buell green?

16:12.872 --> 16:17.442
We should have included
negroes in the study
from the beginning.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.376
But now that we have,

16:18.378 --> 16:21.479
We are committed
to this line of inquiry.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.715
My only caution to you

16:23.717 --> 16:24.515
Would be to remember

16:24.517 --> 16:28.186
We're not here to
forward anyone's
agenda.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.487
The mandate of our study

16:29.489 --> 16:32.957
Is to only go
where the
research leads.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.225
Meaning it
isn't your job

16:34.227 --> 16:37.462
To eradicate the image of,
say, the mandingo...

16:37.464 --> 16:41.065
A negro that acts
like an animal,
obsessed with sex.

16:41.067 --> 16:43.267
Or the jezebel,
the female equivalent.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.068
Virginia: I'm sorry.

16:44.070 --> 16:47.572
The portrayal of black
women as oversexed
and immoral

16:47.574 --> 16:49.407
To the point
where a black woman
can't be raped

16:49.409 --> 16:52.477
Because
she wants sex
all the time.

16:52.479 --> 16:57.815
Well...
Certain facts
can be measured.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.551
Penis size,
performance,
frequency.

17:00.553 --> 17:05.089
As mrs. Johnson says,
we will publish
what we find

17:05.091 --> 17:08.626
And let the facts
speak for themselves.

17:08.927 --> 17:11.763
It's about time
they did.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.567
(switch clicks)

17:17.302 --> 17:19.537
What's going to
happen to me?

17:19.972 --> 17:20.905
I'm sorry?

17:20.907 --> 17:25.143
I want you to
tell me what's going
to happen to me.

17:25.145 --> 17:28.146
You should talk
to your general
physician.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.281
I'm asking you.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.016
You seem to
not think of me
as a person,

17:32.018 --> 17:34.385
So I trust you
to tell me straight,

17:34.387 --> 17:36.821
Not to sugar coat it.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.326
The radiation
may slow the cancer,

17:42.328 --> 17:45.363
But it's unlikely
to stop it.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.864
Your aphasia will worsen.

17:46.866 --> 17:51.069
It'll be harder to express
your thoughts,
to think clearly.

17:51.071 --> 17:54.472
You'll start to sleep
for longer and
longer periods,

17:54.474 --> 17:58.342
And you will suffer loss
of bladder and bowel control.

17:58.344 --> 18:01.112
Your family can hire
a laundry service.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.014
What about pain?

18:03.649 --> 18:04.782
It varies.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.618
You can talk to your doctor
about morphine, but it's...

18:07.620 --> 18:09.420
Not readily given.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.922
No.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.524
You'll slip
into unconsciousness.

18:13.526 --> 18:18.396
By the end,
you won't know
what's happening.

18:19.865 --> 18:23.401
But I'm sure that
your loved ones
will do everything they can

18:23.403 --> 18:26.270
To see that
you're comfortable.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.650
Lillian, wait.

18:42.921 --> 18:44.555
Lillian!

18:46.625 --> 18:48.326
Lilli...

18:48.328 --> 18:49.026
Lillian.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.229
I'm done, virginia,
with treatment.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.197
(sighs)
don't be ridiculous.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.433
Ridiculous
is lying on that table,

18:55.435 --> 18:56.067
Radiating my brain

18:56.069 --> 18:58.970
In the hopes of having
a few more days
to lie on that table

18:58.972 --> 18:59.837
And have more radiation.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.273
I understand
why you would
feel that way,

19:02.275 --> 19:04.709
But you can't
just give up.

19:04.711 --> 19:05.309
Why not?

19:05.311 --> 19:08.246
Why isn't that
the very best thing
I could possibly do...

19:08.248 --> 19:10.448
Stop hoping, accept what is?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.116
Because you never know
what could happen.

19:12.118 --> 19:14.352
What did the doctor say?
Surely there
must be a protocol.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.455
Virginia.
There could be
a new trial a month from now.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.689
A new course of treatment.
Virginia!

19:18.691 --> 19:21.993
Even if the odds are 100 to 1,
you could be that one.

19:21.995 --> 19:25.963
We are not days
away from curing
metastatic cancer.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.765
I don't want to spend
what time I have left

19:27.767 --> 19:32.236
Fighting a battle
that I certainly
will lose.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.405
And mostly (sighs)

19:34.407 --> 19:36.474
I don't want
to fight with you.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.177
You don't want
to fight at all,
clearly.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.812
You don't even...
You don't even
want to fight for your life.

19:41.814 --> 19:45.883
I'm sorry.
I... I don't know
how to not fight.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.587
I'm sorry, too.

19:53.292 --> 19:55.059
Lillian.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.864
What are you doing?

19:59.866 --> 20:05.269
I'm going to take, um,
uh...God damn it.

20:05.271 --> 20:05.870
A taxi.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.573
Let me at least
drive you home,
lillian.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.473
Please, for my sake.

20:09.475 --> 20:11.909
Virginia,
I can't do
this for you.

20:11.911 --> 20:15.646
I tried. But I'm done.

20:26.825 --> 20:29.026
(car door closes)

20:35.767 --> 20:36.434
(laughing)

20:36.436 --> 20:39.070
You know
what we should
do this weekend

20:39.072 --> 20:40.204
Is take a trip up north.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.072
I have a little cabin
up there.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.307
Yeah, smack
in the middle of the
st. Francois mountains.

20:43.309 --> 20:45.276
Fresh air,
great fishing,

20:45.278 --> 20:47.578
And it's spontaneous,
and I love spontaneous.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.548
Mmm, yeah,
like the both of you,
shooting from the hip,

20:50.550 --> 20:52.817
Showing up here tonight
completely unannounced.

20:52.819 --> 20:53.718
And we're glad you did,
of course.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.019
We were going
to dinner, anyway.
Right?

20:55.021 --> 20:56.387
The more the merrier,
now that we're four.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.857
I'm always telling al
he needs to be
more spontaneous.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.793
Hel, are you
serious about this?

21:02.795 --> 21:04.195
Only one way to find out.

21:04.197 --> 21:06.464
Wait, wait.
What's this now?

21:06.466 --> 21:10.835
Uh... Well,
helen wants us
to elope.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.503
(laughing)

21:12.505 --> 21:15.906
Wait a minute.
Helen proposed to you?

21:15.908 --> 21:16.741
It's crazy, isn't it?

21:16.743 --> 21:18.976
I mean, I've never heard
of a woman doing that.

21:18.978 --> 21:19.810
It's so romantic.

21:19.812 --> 21:21.379
We'll do gene's
party tomorrow.

21:21.381 --> 21:22.780
We'll get married
the next day.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.548
Gene and betty
can be our witnesses.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.517
This is all happening
so fast!

21:26.519 --> 21:27.785
I just want
to make sure that...

21:27.787 --> 21:29.687
I mean, are you
pulling my leg?

21:29.689 --> 21:33.424
Listen to me, kid.
I'm givin' it to you
straight.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.026
Clark gable?
No!

21:35.028 --> 21:36.560
God, I can
never guess it!

21:36.562 --> 21:37.728
One rocco
more or less...

21:37.730 --> 21:41.232
For christ's sake, al,
it's humphrey
fucking bogart.

21:41.234 --> 21:41.866
(laughing)

21:41.868 --> 21:43.234
Okay, well,
who cares who it is?

21:43.236 --> 21:45.202
If you want
to get hitched to me,

21:45.204 --> 21:46.871
I want to get
hitched to you.

21:46.873 --> 21:49.006
Come here, baby.

21:50.008 --> 21:50.541
Hey!

21:50.543 --> 21:52.276
Hey, you want
to do that,
you get a room.

21:52.278 --> 21:53.678
You do not do
that in this house.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.379
That is just
fucking rude!

21:55.381 --> 21:57.381
Whoa. Betty!

21:58.650 --> 22:00.051
Uh...

22:00.452 --> 22:02.586
I, uh, I'm just tired.
You three go to dinner.

22:02.588 --> 22:05.523
My head is splitting.
I got to rest.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.291
(sighs)

22:13.498 --> 22:19.503
I promised I wouldn't
tell anybody, but now...

22:20.939 --> 22:22.506
All bets are off.

22:22.508 --> 22:25.276
She's being so pigheaded.

22:25.544 --> 22:26.877
Or realistic.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.946
She's given up.

22:33.218 --> 22:37.922
And I (sighs)
I didn't see it
coming.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.424
You said
she'd been
sick for years.

22:40.426 --> 22:41.926
No.

22:42.427 --> 22:46.764
I didn't see
her coming.

22:52.804 --> 23:00.411
I'm always so...Careful,
you know?

23:00.545 --> 23:02.413
With people.

23:03.415 --> 23:09.653
Always keep that wall up.

23:10.989 --> 23:13.491
Lillian snuck in.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.330
But how is it
even possible?

23:19.332 --> 23:25.503
She's so...
Rigid and demanding.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.805
She's a complete
know it all.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.808
She... She's not even
very much fun.

23:31.343 --> 23:32.710
If we're going
to be honest.

23:32.712 --> 23:36.714
You didn't see it
coming because
she's a woman.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.559
(scoffs)

23:49.995 --> 23:54.298
Sometimes I would look
across our office and think,

23:56.468 --> 23:57.635
"mmm, my god.

23:57.637 --> 24:02.440
"she is so...Ferocious."

24:03.542 --> 24:05.342
(chuckles)

24:07.479 --> 24:09.747
But she's alone.

24:17.255 --> 24:20.191
(sobbing)
and she's my friend.

24:22.828 --> 24:24.261
(sniffles)

24:24.263 --> 24:27.798
And I don't
have a lot of those.

24:32.938 --> 24:33.437
(sniffles)

24:33.439 --> 24:39.577
And somehow
lillian snuck
around the wall.

24:40.345 --> 24:43.447
And now she won't
even listen to me.

24:44.883 --> 24:49.787
Lillian, who she...
She knows me.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.328
(sniffles)

24:58.363 --> 25:00.231
(sighs)

25:10.442 --> 25:12.343
I know you.

26:10.936 --> 26:13.103
(car door closes)

26:19.411 --> 26:22.580
It was a friend high up
in the police department.

26:22.582 --> 26:23.981
I simply asked
him to check

26:23.983 --> 26:26.684
Because I was concerned
about your safety.

26:26.686 --> 26:27.518
It wasn't robert's fault.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.587
So you know
that he has
a record.

26:29.589 --> 26:33.490
He's been
arrested three times!
How can that not concern you?

26:33.492 --> 26:34.959
You don't understand.

26:34.961 --> 26:35.926
He was walking
down the street.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.728
They picked him up
outside a bar.

26:37.730 --> 26:40.764
One arrest
was for assaulting
a police officer.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.132
They assaulted him first.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.368
Coral!
Listen to yourself!

26:44.370 --> 26:45.803
I feel like
robert's
intoxicated you

26:45.805 --> 26:48.839
To the point
where you can't
see straight.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.641
Why are you doing this?

26:50.643 --> 26:52.943
Because I am uncomfortable.

26:52.945 --> 26:55.646
I'm very uncomfortable
with him

26:55.648 --> 26:59.350
And whatever it is
that's going on
between you two.

26:59.352 --> 27:01.585
I can't have me
or baby john

27:01.587 --> 27:03.887
Around someone
with a criminal record.

27:03.889 --> 27:06.523
And I can see
that I can't
persuade you

27:06.525 --> 27:08.726
To stop seeing him, so...

27:08.728 --> 27:11.996
Given that
I don't feel
comfortable,

27:12.197 --> 27:14.698
That I need
to keep
my family safe,

27:14.700 --> 27:17.167
I can't have him
coming to the house.

27:17.169 --> 27:18.335
I'm sorry,
but from now on,

27:18.337 --> 27:20.237
You're gonna
have to find someone
else to drive you.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.506
You'll have to make
other arrangements.

27:22.508 --> 27:24.408
Yes, ma'am.

27:26.111 --> 27:28.846
I know you think
you have something
with robert,

27:28.848 --> 27:31.348
But ask yourself.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.751
Is it really worth it?

27:33.753 --> 27:39.657
All this tumult
for that one thing?

27:40.225 --> 27:40.991
I'll make a call.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.927
My auntie can
pick me up tonight.

27:46.731 --> 27:48.265
Okay.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.901
(sighs)

27:51.870 --> 27:56.006
I got the funnies,
if that's what
you're looking for.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.409
Alka-seltzer, more like.

27:58.777 --> 28:00.644
You must have
polished off
an entire bottle

28:00.646 --> 28:03.447
Last night
after we left.

28:04.716 --> 28:06.050
Al and I were laughing

28:06.052 --> 28:08.385
About when we were kids,
we would double date.

28:08.387 --> 28:09.019
I'd always drive.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.722
I would leave al
in the back seat with
his date to have at it

28:11.724 --> 28:14.591
While whatever girl
was stuck with me

28:14.593 --> 28:16.727
Would be sitting in
the front seat with
her hands in her lap,

28:16.729 --> 28:20.264
Wondering
why I suddenly
went paralyzed.

28:20.266 --> 28:22.666
Al's an oaf.
Oh, really?

28:22.668 --> 28:23.534
'cause from
where I'm standing,

28:23.536 --> 28:25.202
It seems like
maybe you
like al a lot.

28:25.204 --> 28:28.172
Maybe you got
a thing for al.

28:28.406 --> 28:29.640
Oh, my god.

28:29.642 --> 28:30.474
What? Don't play
dumb with me.

28:30.476 --> 28:33.010
You yelled like a house on
fire when al kissed helen.

28:33.012 --> 28:35.579
Their pawing each other
was a vulgar display.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.981
Or maybe you want to be
in that back seat with al,

28:37.983 --> 28:39.750
Have him kissing on you
instead of helen.

28:39.752 --> 28:42.252
Maybe I'm just
not man enough for you.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.087
Oh, you can't be serious.

28:43.089 --> 28:46.223
You... You are worth
a dozen als...
Two dozen als.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.958
We promised each other
no more lies,

28:47.960 --> 28:50.094
So if I am
disappointing you,

28:50.096 --> 28:51.462
You know, between
the sheets, just...

28:51.464 --> 28:52.596
Oh, for god's sakes.
You want the truth?

28:52.598 --> 28:57.634
I was genuinely
sickened by that
al-and-helen freak show.

28:57.636 --> 28:58.836
What are you talking about?
They're getting married.

28:58.838 --> 29:02.573
They are somewhere
between the bearded lady
and the monkey man.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.942
I have been
putting up with
al because of you,

29:04.944 --> 29:06.710
Because you
are friends with him,

29:06.712 --> 29:10.647
But (scoffs) last night,
that... That was too much.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.316
I cannot stand al,

29:12.318 --> 29:15.519
And I don't want
to see them ever again.

29:19.824 --> 29:22.392
Even helen?
(sighs)

29:23.328 --> 29:26.897
Helen especially.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.032
Whew.

29:29.034 --> 29:31.135
If I could check
just a few facts
with you.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.737
I'm wondering
if part of the reason

29:33.739 --> 29:35.272
You were drawn
to medicine in
the first place

29:35.274 --> 29:38.776
Was due to the fact that
you were sickly as a child.

29:40.078 --> 29:40.744
I'm sorry?

29:40.746 --> 29:42.279
You suffered
two serious bouts

29:42.281 --> 29:44.948
With a fairly rare
blood infection.
Septicemia.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.683
Which landed you
in the hospital

29:46.685 --> 29:50.354
For a three-month stay
when you were 8,

29:50.356 --> 29:52.723
Four and
a half months at 10.

29:52.725 --> 29:57.127
That must have
left a strong impression
on a young boy.

29:59.764 --> 30:03.200
I went into,
uh, medicine

30:03.202 --> 30:04.501
Because I was focused.

30:04.503 --> 30:07.371
I knew what
I wanted to do.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.606
But you had
a wide variety
of interests

30:09.608 --> 30:10.607
At hamilton college.

30:10.609 --> 30:13.243
You were a boxer.
You learned
to fly a plane.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.712
I had a pilot's license. So?

30:15.714 --> 30:18.215
So why not be a pilot?

30:19.551 --> 30:20.150
Uh...

30:20.152 --> 30:23.987
As an obstetrician,
you get to bring life
into the world.

30:23.989 --> 30:27.825
So, the sickly child
became prometheus,

30:27.827 --> 30:30.727
Creating man from clay.

30:31.963 --> 30:33.630
If you're trying to imply

30:33.632 --> 30:36.200
I have some sort
of god complex...

30:36.202 --> 30:39.803
The point is
your story is one
our readers can understand.

30:39.805 --> 30:41.672
You started
under adverse
circumstances,

30:41.674 --> 30:44.474
You focused on work
that served the
greater good,

30:44.476 --> 30:45.976
And now
you're here
at buell green,

30:45.978 --> 30:48.779
Having come
from memorial
hospital,

30:48.781 --> 30:51.682
Where your tenure
was very short.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.483
A month, in fact.

30:53.485 --> 30:54.985
Technically, yes.

30:54.987 --> 30:58.622
Is it true you assaulted
a physician at memorial?

31:03.261 --> 31:06.797
You...
You talked to
doug greathouse?

31:09.334 --> 31:11.702
Doug greathouse
is irrelevant to
this story.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.837
There was
also an incident

31:13.839 --> 31:15.339
Where you put
a fire extinguisher

31:15.341 --> 31:17.007
Through a window
at maternity hospital.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.543
This apparently led
to your dismissal.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.744
That is incorrect.

31:20.746 --> 31:21.445
You weren't dismissed?

31:21.447 --> 31:23.480
The chancellor and I
did not see eye-to-eye.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.148
Miss hogue,
the story we agreed

31:25.150 --> 31:27.618
Is about
the positive effect
of our study

31:27.620 --> 31:30.487
On the negro community
here at buell green.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.154
And it is.

31:31.156 --> 31:34.625
We also agreed the facts
would speak for themselves.

31:34.627 --> 31:35.759
And from what
I can gather,

31:35.761 --> 31:39.129
You've had
a very successful
career,

31:39.131 --> 31:41.999
But now with
your sex study,

31:42.200 --> 31:43.367
You've met
with resistance.

31:43.369 --> 31:47.104
And so you've
countered
with resistance.

31:47.106 --> 31:47.671
You've had to.

31:47.673 --> 31:49.673
Which makes you
a revolutionary of sorts,

31:49.675 --> 31:51.642
Estranged from the
white community.

31:51.644 --> 31:53.810
I'm not estranged
from the white community.

31:53.812 --> 31:55.646
Like many
in our community,

31:55.648 --> 31:57.114
Forced to resort
to violent tactics.

31:57.116 --> 32:00.417
Well, according
to greathouse and
his band of idiots.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.486
Jesus, don't...
Don't write that.

32:02.488 --> 32:05.489
Look, these...
These incidents
taken out of context

32:05.491 --> 32:06.256
Will be misunderstood,

32:06.258 --> 32:09.459
And I do not want
them used in the piece.

32:10.728 --> 32:14.598
You don't get to say
what's included
in the piece.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.733
It's my study.

32:16.968 --> 32:19.202
And it's my story.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.674
So you won't
be our witnesses now?

32:23.676 --> 32:25.943
No. No,
I don't think so.

32:25.945 --> 32:28.245
And... And I also
have to talk to
you about...

32:28.247 --> 32:30.747
About the party
the other night.

32:30.749 --> 32:31.548
What the hell?

32:31.550 --> 32:33.884
I know.
Al, I'm sorry.

32:33.886 --> 32:34.818
I was gonna make up
some story,

32:34.820 --> 32:36.753
Like the kitchen
caught on fire

32:36.755 --> 32:38.422
Or the caterer
got run over
by a bus,

32:38.424 --> 32:39.189
But we got a history,

32:39.191 --> 32:41.391
So I'm... I'm gonna
give it to you straight.

32:41.393 --> 32:43.527
Betty doesn't
like helen.

32:43.529 --> 32:44.628
But they're
thick as thieves.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.397
Maybe they once were,
but something's
gone sour there,

32:47.399 --> 32:52.336
And... And betty
is done with helen.

32:53.538 --> 32:56.306
That is just insane.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.742
I mean, those two...
They're so close.

32:58.744 --> 33:01.011
The way they
kiss each other
right on the lips

33:01.013 --> 33:02.045
And now they
hate each other?

33:02.047 --> 33:03.246
I don't...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:03.248 --> 33:06.917
What are you
talking about?
On the... On the lips?

33:07.085 --> 33:07.584
Yeah.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.821
At kemoll's.
That night we
all had dinner.

33:10.823 --> 33:11.788
I went out to see if helen

33:11.790 --> 33:13.290
Wanted me to order
creme de menthe

33:13.292 --> 33:15.625
When she left the table
because betty was so upset.

33:15.627 --> 33:16.193
Yeah.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.894
I see them
come out of
the ladies' room,

33:17.896 --> 33:19.796
And suddenly
they're in this lip lock,

33:19.798 --> 33:23.734
Like...Cary grant
and grace kelly

33:23.736 --> 33:26.236
In  <i>"to catch a thief."</i>

33:27.338 --> 33:30.173
I mean, I had aunts
that used to lip-kiss,

33:30.175 --> 33:32.009
But they were guineas.

33:32.011 --> 33:35.112
Had mustaches.
And that was like pecking.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.480
But helen and betty...

33:36.482 --> 33:37.714
Wait. Wait.

33:37.716 --> 33:40.550
Al, wait a minute.

33:40.885 --> 33:42.185
I mean, come on.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.421
As I live and breathe.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.230
(doorbell ringing)

33:56.000 --> 33:58.535
Are you going
to let me in?

33:58.903 --> 34:01.104
I don't open
my door to salesmen.

34:01.106 --> 34:02.806
I'm not selling anything.

34:02.808 --> 34:06.510
Are you sure?
Aren't you always?

34:06.978 --> 34:09.846
You peddle diet pills
in a cancer ward.

34:10.715 --> 34:11.214
(chuckles)

34:11.216 --> 34:15.419
That was not
my finest moment,
I'll admit.

34:15.720 --> 34:18.488
Please let me
in anyway.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.234
I thought
if you had
a shopping list,

34:31.236 --> 34:34.438
I could pick up
some groceries
for you.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.839
I'm all set.

34:35.940 --> 34:38.475
Any errands
that need running?

34:38.477 --> 34:40.544
I could, uh...

34:40.611 --> 34:44.347
I could take those
letters to the post office,
if you'd like.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.859
This one's for my family.

34:55.861 --> 34:58.795
I was going to send it
special delivery.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.766
Can you give it
to them in person?

35:02.768 --> 35:04.034
In person?

35:04.036 --> 35:05.302
They're instructions.

35:05.304 --> 35:07.938
There's a family
plot in weymouth.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.540
The depauls there
go back to the 1800s.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.844
My parents will
want me buried
in this plot.

35:14.612 --> 35:17.114
They will insist on it.

35:17.248 --> 35:20.250
But I want my body
to go to science.

35:21.119 --> 35:21.985
All those brave souls

35:21.987 --> 35:24.955
Whose bodies taught me
how to be a doctor.

35:26.657 --> 35:27.757
Maybe some
medical student

35:27.759 --> 35:31.428
Will discover
a cure for ovarian
cancer by using mine.

35:31.430 --> 35:35.098
There'd be
a nice symmetry to
that, don't you think?

35:35.733 --> 35:39.269
By taking this,
you're promising me
you'll see to it,

35:39.704 --> 35:42.806
That my wishes
are carried out.

35:44.575 --> 35:46.843
Will you take it?

35:50.915 --> 35:52.883
There you go.

35:54.118 --> 35:55.418
Good night, mrs. Masters.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.622
Oh. Um,
good night, coral.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.924
My auntie is
waiting for me.

36:28.286 --> 36:31.454
(dog barking in distance)

36:31.456 --> 36:34.558
(birds chirping)

36:58.783 --> 36:59.716
(sighs)

36:59.718 --> 37:02.352
No doubt
miss hogue
told you

37:02.354 --> 37:07.390
I would prefer
she not go ahead
with this story.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.258
She did.

37:08.260 --> 37:11.528
But I read
the rough draft
of her piece,

37:11.530 --> 37:13.463
And she presents
the conflict you have

37:13.465 --> 37:16.533
As part of a larger
and righteous battle.

37:16.801 --> 37:20.370
I won't lie.
Makes for good copy.

37:20.372 --> 37:21.538
No doubt it does.

37:21.540 --> 37:24.140
But to be honest,
I'm not worried about myself.

37:24.142 --> 37:28.778
I'm more concerned
about the scientific
findings.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.513
How so?

37:30.515 --> 37:31.514
I initially
told miss hogue

37:31.516 --> 37:34.584
I would let the facts
speak for themselves.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.220
We go wherever
the data leads.

37:37.222 --> 37:40.090
But the initial results
have given me pause.

37:40.092 --> 37:41.992
Miss hogue said
you were just beginning

37:41.994 --> 37:44.361
To bring negroes
into the study.

37:44.363 --> 37:47.631
We've had plenty of,
uh, negro participants

37:47.633 --> 37:50.000
Since arriving
at buell green,

37:50.002 --> 37:51.101
And while
negro sexuality

37:51.103 --> 37:52.402
Wasn't our focus
at maternity,

37:52.404 --> 37:54.504
We had enough subjects
to warrant a control group.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.373
But now
by refocusing
this data

37:56.375 --> 38:01.011
Specifically on
negro performance,
physiology,

38:01.579 --> 38:04.381
We found
significant
differences

38:04.383 --> 38:07.450
Between white
and negro subjects.

38:07.452 --> 38:10.553
Such as?
Penis size, for one.

38:10.555 --> 38:11.688
Sexual appetite.

38:11.690 --> 38:15.025
Elevated
testosterone levels.

38:15.359 --> 38:20.063
I don't think
this is a story
you want to publish.

38:21.699 --> 38:22.532
I think you're lying.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.768
Mr. Wilson,
my methods are
beyond reproach.

38:24.770 --> 38:26.269
You don't want
a story published

38:26.271 --> 38:30.540
That paints you
as an ostracized
and unstable figure,

38:30.542 --> 38:32.742
So instead,
you threaten me.

38:32.744 --> 38:33.410
No one's threatening...

38:33.412 --> 38:36.713
Hold before
me the specter of a story
that claims it's true.

38:36.715 --> 38:41.384
The negro is an animal.
The negro wants your women.

38:41.386 --> 38:43.453
I'm not an errand boy,
dr. Masters,

38:43.455 --> 38:44.187
Here to do your bidding.

38:44.189 --> 38:46.890
I'm an editor,
and I will publish
that article.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.592
Even though men
have been lynched
and castrated

38:49.594 --> 38:52.829
For the mere perception
of sexual aggression,

38:52.831 --> 38:55.265
Never mind
the scientific
confirmation of it.

38:55.267 --> 38:57.701
Did you think that
you could bully me
into this

38:57.703 --> 39:01.538
And I'd just
shuffle away
and say, "yes, sir.

39:01.540 --> 39:02.405
"yes, dr. Masters.

39:02.407 --> 39:05.542
"I'm sure scared
of what your
study might do"?

39:05.544 --> 39:07.744
(scoffs)
what kind of a man are you?

39:07.746 --> 39:09.179
Well, I'm not
the kind of man

39:09.181 --> 39:13.049
Who would savage someone's
reputation, his livelihood,

39:13.051 --> 39:17.053
His life's work
because it
makes good copy.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.555
Why don't you go look
in the mirror

39:18.557 --> 39:20.924
Next time you
ask that question?

39:21.025 --> 39:22.025
Okay, dr. Masters,

39:22.027 --> 39:25.729
I'm a go look
in the mirror,
just like you say.

39:30.634 --> 39:31.301
You publish this story,

39:31.303 --> 39:34.537
And I promise you,
I will publish
my findings.

39:34.905 --> 39:37.273
Fraudulent findings.

39:37.608 --> 39:40.009
I will prove you a fraud.

39:40.011 --> 39:42.412
You want to
take that risk?

39:42.980 --> 39:45.782
My study
may have been
shown the door,

39:45.784 --> 39:49.619
But I've got
an office
full of accolades.

39:49.621 --> 39:54.524
I've got 25 years
of a sterling
reputation.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.359
You know,
I've delivered
the children

39:56.361 --> 39:59.462
Of every prominent
politician, lawmaker,

39:59.464 --> 40:02.832
And newspaper man
in this city.

40:02.967 --> 40:05.702
So why don't
you go ahead
and try me?

40:05.704 --> 40:08.905
Let's see who
the public listens to...

40:08.907 --> 40:12.842
Me or you.

40:31.996 --> 40:34.697
(elevator bell dings)

40:40.037 --> 40:43.640
You ready
for cheese puffs
and champagne?

40:43.642 --> 40:44.707
(chuckles)

40:44.709 --> 40:48.344
Hey, how do you get,
uh, this, uh,
what do you call it?

40:48.346 --> 40:49.245
That's a cummerbund.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.548
Yeah. How do you get
this cummerbund off?

40:51.550 --> 40:53.750
Betty, come on.
Hey, what?

40:53.752 --> 40:55.018
A girl can't take
her husband upstairs

40:55.020 --> 40:57.620
For a quickie
before the guests
arrive?

40:57.622 --> 40:59.289
Betty.

40:59.356 --> 41:03.226
What is that?
Is that your attempt to...
To reassure me?

41:04.295 --> 41:05.195
Because
I'm reassured now.

41:05.197 --> 41:09.032
About al, about
all these other men
that you've been with...

41:09.500 --> 41:11.768
I know... I know
that they didn't
mean anything to you.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.236
I know you
didn't love them.

41:13.238 --> 41:17.674
No, no, I never
did love any of them.

41:19.176 --> 41:22.078
Because you
loved helen.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.785
(sighs)

41:32.056 --> 41:34.390
Who are you, betty?

41:35.159 --> 41:37.160
Huh? Come on.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.661
Just tell me.

41:38.663 --> 41:42.432
I mean, we've been
round and round with this.

41:42.666 --> 41:46.202
Come on.
I think you
owe me the truth.

41:46.204 --> 41:52.842
Please, just for once,
tell me, who are you really?

41:55.312 --> 41:58.047
I'm... I'm ju...
I'm just...

42:00.684 --> 42:04.787
I'm just a woman who...

42:05.055 --> 42:09.959
Yes, loved helen,
but that doesn't matter.

42:09.961 --> 42:11.995
Oh, it matters to me.
No, gene.

42:11.997 --> 42:12.862
You're the
one I married.

42:12.864 --> 42:14.898
You're the one
I'm gonna stay
married to.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.132
It's just you and me,

42:16.134 --> 42:17.033
Hand-in-hand,
despite everything.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.635
Everything...
Oh, and it has
been everything.

42:18.637 --> 42:22.639
Every lie imaginable,
betty. Come on.

42:22.641 --> 42:25.742
About your past,
about you having kids.

42:26.143 --> 42:28.478
And I have
made peace with...

42:28.480 --> 42:30.480
I have made peace
with all of it,

42:30.482 --> 42:32.949
Because I found
something that
was important to me.

42:32.951 --> 42:33.917
I found someone
that I loved.

42:33.919 --> 42:37.420
And now you're
telling me that your
heart belongs to helen,

42:37.422 --> 42:39.522
And that doesn't matter,
that I should be happy

42:39.524 --> 42:43.059
About these
fucking compromises
and half-truths

42:43.061 --> 42:45.361
That are gonna carry us
into old age,

42:45.363 --> 42:48.665
This fucking avalanche
that is our marriage!

42:49.033 --> 42:49.599
I care about you!

42:49.601 --> 42:52.135
Care... Care is what
you have for a stray dog

42:52.137 --> 42:53.269
That you find
in the road.

42:53.271 --> 42:56.906
Love is what you have
for someone that you
share your bed with.

42:56.908 --> 42:59.275
Gene, there are...
Stop it!

42:59.277 --> 43:00.176
I cannot hear
this anymore.

43:00.178 --> 43:01.644
You want to
sell yourself.

43:01.646 --> 43:04.147
You're the...
You're the pro here.
Go ahead.

43:04.149 --> 43:09.285
But I will...
I cannot sell
myself this cheap.

43:14.058 --> 43:16.292
(doorbell rings)

43:19.530 --> 43:22.432
(instrumental music
plays on radio)

43:23.400 --> 43:26.970
I learned to
box step to
this song.

43:29.506 --> 43:31.107
At cotillion.

43:31.109 --> 43:33.509
(both laughing)

43:34.244 --> 43:36.245
I was 13.

43:36.847 --> 43:39.983
Eight inches taller
than the tallest boy.

43:39.985 --> 43:41.417
Oh.

43:42.286 --> 43:44.253
They called me "giraffe."

43:44.255 --> 43:46.255
Not just tall.

43:47.424 --> 43:48.625
Spotted.

43:48.627 --> 43:50.693
(both chuckling)

43:51.095 --> 43:52.295
Well, a few of the boys

43:52.297 --> 43:54.597
Must have caught up
to you eventually.

43:54.599 --> 43:55.865
A little piece of you

43:55.867 --> 43:57.333
Is always the girl
you were at 13.

43:57.335 --> 44:01.070
Did you ever
fall in love
with a boy?

44:01.238 --> 44:03.139
I think so.

44:05.476 --> 44:09.779
(chuckles)
no one's ever been
in love with me, though.

44:10.314 --> 44:13.416
Not that I've known
of, anyway.

44:14.184 --> 44:17.387
I've had relations
a few times.

44:17.821 --> 44:20.256
No one's ever stayed.

44:21.492 --> 44:23.826
You know, lingered.

44:26.563 --> 44:29.465
And that's what
I've missed out on,

44:31.235 --> 44:33.803
That kind of closeness.

44:35.572 --> 44:38.207
You have that with bill.

44:38.409 --> 44:39.776
With bill?

44:39.778 --> 44:41.444
(scoffs)

44:42.613 --> 44:44.380
With bill.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.519
He loves you.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.589
He never says it.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.392
But you know it.

44:57.795 --> 45:00.797
That's everything,
isn't it?

45:17.681 --> 45:21.217
This is how
I get my kids
to drift off.

45:22.219 --> 45:25.154
I trace words
on their foreheads.

45:26.156 --> 45:28.958
"sleep tight."

45:31.829 --> 45:33.463
"eat your broccoli."

45:33.465 --> 45:35.565
(both chuckle)

45:37.534 --> 45:41.537
With me,
you could always
play connect the dots.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.073
No.

45:44.075 --> 45:46.209
More like stars.

45:46.310 --> 45:50.346
I see the constellations
in these freckles.

45:50.414 --> 45:52.615
The big dipper.

45:53.684 --> 45:55.752
Ursa major.
(chuckles)

45:55.754 --> 46:00.089
Oh, and
there's lilantha

46:00.091 --> 46:02.825
With her crown
and her chariot.

46:02.827 --> 46:04.527
Lilantha...
There's no lilantha.

46:04.529 --> 46:06.929
Oh, you don't know
that myth?
No.

46:06.931 --> 46:08.297
The warrior princess?

46:08.299 --> 46:11.334
Strong?
And brave?

46:13.203 --> 46:15.905
And so tall and beautiful

46:17.074 --> 46:20.209
That she struck
some men dumb.

46:21.945 --> 46:24.280
Some men very dumb.

46:24.414 --> 46:26.048
(chuckles)

46:26.050 --> 46:28.818
But she knew
who she was.

46:30.721 --> 46:34.123
And that is why
she burns so brightly.

46:35.025 --> 46:38.528
You can always
spot her in the sky.

46:58.415 --> 47:01.150
I'll see you
in the morning.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.553
Okay.
In the morning.

47:29.713 --> 47:32.081
(train whistle
blows in distance)

47:32.083 --> 47:34.684
(indistinct conversations)

47:35.118 --> 47:37.153
Robert: After you.

47:38.222 --> 47:40.389
(car door closes)

47:40.724 --> 47:42.859
(thumping)
ohh!

47:45.462 --> 47:47.296
Coral: That was good.
It was fun.

47:47.298 --> 47:50.199
Robert:
Yeah, it was nice, huh?

47:54.271 --> 47:56.205
(door creaks)

48:18.095 --> 48:20.363
What are you doing?

48:21.131 --> 48:22.632
Do you know
it's a federal offense

48:22.634 --> 48:23.599
To tamper with
someone's mail?

48:23.601 --> 48:25.902
I'm not tampering.
I'm looking for coral.

48:25.904 --> 48:28.104
I didn't see her name
on any of the apartments.

48:28.106 --> 48:30.439
What do you
want with coral?

48:30.441 --> 48:31.741
Is that another threat?

48:31.743 --> 48:33.009
Just because
you're her boyfriend

48:33.011 --> 48:34.310
Doesn't mean
that you get to...

48:34.312 --> 48:36.679
Whoa. Boyfriend?
Who told you that?

48:36.681 --> 48:38.748
Coral told me.

48:39.750 --> 48:42.018
I'm her brother.

48:42.152 --> 48:45.187
You...
You have
different last names.

48:45.189 --> 48:47.590
We have different fathers.

48:48.992 --> 48:51.994
But she...
She said that you...

48:51.996 --> 48:55.231
About your relationship...
About what...

49:04.341 --> 49:06.842
Your leg is bleeding.

49:06.844 --> 49:09.211
What did you
scrape it on?

49:10.447 --> 49:12.014
May I?

49:16.920 --> 49:18.688
Ow.

49:21.525 --> 49:23.759
I don't know
what coral told you,

49:23.761 --> 49:30.266
But whatever it was,
it wasn't true.

49:38.842 --> 49:41.344
I'm fine.
You can stop.

49:41.812 --> 49:43.913
I said stop.

49:45.916 --> 49:47.817
Give this to coral.
Please.

49:47.819 --> 49:50.920
This is her severance.
Take it.

49:51.188 --> 49:53.422
Just please take it.

49:53.424 --> 49:54.023
You know what?

49:54.025 --> 49:56.425
You can tell her
that she is fired.

49:59.062 --> 50:01.063
(sobbing)

50:05.402 --> 50:06.802
(sighs)

50:06.804 --> 50:08.871
(trembling)

51:33.190 --> 51:35.558
(breathing heavily)

51:39.129 --> 51:40.830
Lillian?

51:41.598 --> 51:44.333
It's me.
I forgot to
take the letter.

51:47.771 --> 51:50.372
(breathing raggedly)

51:52.876 --> 51:55.211
Lillian?
(envelope clatters)

51:55.213 --> 51:56.979
Lillian?

51:57.681 --> 51:59.949
Lillian. Lillian!

52:02.219 --> 52:04.120
(ringing)

52:05.489 --> 52:06.088
Woman:  <i>Operator.</i>

52:06.090 --> 52:07.289
Yes, hello,
I need an ambulance.

52:07.291 --> 52:10.359
My friend,
she's taken sleeping pills...
An overdose.

52:10.361 --> 52:12.628
<i>Okay, ma'am.</i>
<i>I need the address.</i>

52:12.630 --> 52:14.763
The address...

52:14.765 --> 52:16.532
(sighs)

52:22.139 --> 52:24.039
Woman:  <i>Ma'am?</i>

52:28.311 --> 52:30.446
<i>Hello? Ma'am?</i>

52:33.283 --> 52:35.918
(breathing raggedly)

52:37.487 --> 52:39.421
(inhales sharply)

52:42.559 --> 52:45.094
(breathing heavily)

52:53.503 --> 52:59.642
I have, uh,
never misrepresented
my work.

53:01.144 --> 53:02.011
Ever.

53:02.013 --> 53:03.579
Even as a tactic.

53:03.581 --> 53:04.780
Yes, so I heard.

53:04.782 --> 53:09.518
There's nothing
more dangerous
than a desperate man.

53:09.520 --> 53:14.723
I can't, uh,
continue like this.

53:15.926 --> 53:19.094
Took me 16 years
at good samaritan

53:19.096 --> 53:23.365
Before I left
to build something
of my own...

53:24.167 --> 53:25.801
This hospital...

53:25.803 --> 53:27.303
Before I finally turned
my attention

53:27.305 --> 53:32.975
Fully and without
compromise to the
work I was meant to do.

53:33.210 --> 53:38.914
I can't work,
uh, in a hospital
anymore.

53:41.117 --> 53:48.090
I can't be beholden
to others' rules.

53:50.026 --> 53:54.029
God knows
who would have
me even if I could...

53:54.331 --> 53:56.365
So cut the cord.

53:56.367 --> 53:59.535
(exhales sharply)
25 years of a career.

54:01.571 --> 54:02.905
My entire life.

54:02.907 --> 54:07.910
No more delivering babies,
surgical privileges gone.

54:07.912 --> 54:11.547
It feels like dying,
and it is.

54:11.549 --> 54:16.352
So let's see
if you have the
guts to be reborn.

54:16.786 --> 54:19.989
I want your office
cleared out by morning.

54:32.369 --> 54:34.470
(doorbell rings)

54:35.372 --> 54:37.006
(sighs)

54:44.948 --> 54:47.650
I'm sorry.
I must have, uh...

54:47.652 --> 54:49.852
You're looking
for virginia?

54:52.122 --> 54:54.323
Shelley decklin.

54:54.491 --> 54:56.625
Who are you?

54:56.993 --> 54:58.594
Yeah, I thought
you might be her,

54:58.596 --> 55:01.363
That she lost her key
or something.

55:01.365 --> 55:03.699
Who are you?
(chuckles)

55:03.701 --> 55:04.833
I just said.

55:04.835 --> 55:08.270
Who are you, uh,
to virginia?

55:08.605 --> 55:10.072
Her... Her beau.

55:10.074 --> 55:12.808
I... I guess
that's who I am.

55:12.876 --> 55:14.143
We were supposed
to meet here tonight,

55:14.145 --> 55:16.812
But so far
she is a no show.

55:16.814 --> 55:19.014
No call, nothing.

55:19.215 --> 55:20.649
And you have a key.

55:20.651 --> 55:23.519
So, uh, you been
dating awhile?

55:23.653 --> 55:25.421
A couple months.

55:25.423 --> 55:26.689
Met in the lobby
at the park plaza.

55:26.691 --> 55:29.992
Caught the last round
of the moore/durelle fight.

55:29.994 --> 55:34.763
Ah, yes. I r...
I remember that night.

55:35.165 --> 55:37.232
Anyway, uh, I was,
uh, just passing.

55:37.234 --> 55:40.402
(stammers) I'm sorry.
And you are...

55:42.138 --> 55:42.604
Colleague.

55:42.606 --> 55:45.574
Uh, virginia and I
wor... Uh, work together.

55:45.576 --> 55:47.076
That's all.

55:47.078 --> 55:49.311
Can I give her a message?

55:49.446 --> 55:50.946
No.

55:51.481 --> 55:53.315
No message.

56:04.627 --> 56:07.262
(breathing heavily)

56:39.562 --> 56:41.663
(breathing raggedly)

56:50.907 --> 56:53.041
(breathing slows)

56:53.043 --> 56:55.277
(breathing stops)

56:57.380 --> 57:00.015
(baby swing ticking)

57:03.420 --> 57:05.654
Libby: What is it?

57:07.090 --> 57:08.857
I'm, uh...

57:10.994 --> 57:14.329
I'm not feeling
very well.

57:15.565 --> 57:17.266
Bill.

57:38.755 --> 57:41.056
(ticking continues)
