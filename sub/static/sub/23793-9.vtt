>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:36.467 --> 00:37.500
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:37.500 --> 00:38.400
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.300
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:39.300 --> 00:40.467
US.

00:40.467 --> 00:41.500
AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT WITH WHAT

00:41.500 --> 00:42.500
HAS BEEN YET ANOTHER BUSY WEEK

00:42.500 --> 00:44.333
FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION,

00:44.333 --> 00:45.967
BASICALLY THE "SHARKNADO" OF

00:45.967 --> 00:47.200
ADMINISTRATIONS, IN THAT THEY

00:47.200 --> 00:48.467
ARE SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL,

00:48.467 --> 00:49.800
DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN THEIR

00:49.800 --> 00:50.900
PATH, AND WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY

00:50.900 --> 00:53.633
EVENTUALLY HIRE TARA REID.

00:53.633 --> 00:56.367
THE WEEK HAS BEEN DOMINATED BY

00:56.367 --> 00:58.266
THE CONTINUING FALLOUT OF

00:58.266 --> 00:59.467
LAST WEEK'S FBI RAID ON

00:59.467 --> 01:01.166
MICHAEL COHEN, AND WHILE NO

01:01.166 --> 01:04.200
CHARGES HAVE BEEN BROUGHT

01:04.200 --> 01:06.433
AGAINST HIM YET, THERE'S ALREADY

01:06.433 --> 01:07.200
ONE QUESTION ON PEOPLE'S LIPS.

01:07.200 --> 01:07.867
>> WILL PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

01:07.867 --> 01:08.533
PERSONAL LAWYER FLIP?

01:08.533 --> 01:09.266
>> THERE'S THIS QUESTION OF,

01:09.266 --> 01:10.100
WILL HE FLIP?

01:10.100 --> 01:10.900
>> IS COHEN GONNA FLIP?

01:10.900 --> 01:11.800
>> WILL MICHAEL COHEN FLIP?

01:11.800 --> 01:12.800
>> WILL THE FIXER FLIP?

01:12.800 --> 01:14.100
>> HE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY GOING

01:14.100 --> 01:14.967
TO FLIP ON DONALD TRUMP.

01:14.967 --> 01:16.133
>> HAS HE FLIPPED ALREADY?

01:16.133 --> 01:17.066
WHAT WILL CAUSE HIM TO FLIP?

01:17.066 --> 01:20.266
WHAT HAS HE BEEN UP TO?

01:20.266 --> 01:22.300
>> John: NOW, YOU'LL NOTICE

01:22.300 --> 01:27.300
EVERYONE JUST SKIPS THE QUESTION

01:27.300 --> 01:28.333
"DOES TRUMP HAVE SOMETHING TO

01:28.333 --> 01:29.166
HIDE?"

01:29.166 --> 01:29.800
AND GOES STRAIGHT TO "WILL THIS

01:29.800 --> 01:30.533
GUY HIDE IT FOR HIM?"

01:30.533 --> 01:31.433
WHICH DOES MAKES SENSE.

01:31.433 --> 01:31.934
AT THIS POINT, THE ONLY

01:31.934 --> 01:32.667
SURPRISING HEADLINE WOULD BE

01:32.667 --> 01:33.367
"BOMBSHELL: TRUMP DID TOTALLY

01:33.367 --> 01:34.166
NORMAL AND LEGAL STUFF FOR

01:34.166 --> 01:36.300
40 YEARS."

01:36.300 --> 01:38.233
AND WHILE THE PRESIDENT INSISTS

01:38.233 --> 01:40.000
THAT COHEN WON'T FLIP, SOME OF

01:40.000 --> 01:41.567
THOSE CLOSEST TO TRUMP, LIKE ONE

01:41.567 --> 01:43.633
OF HIS OTHER LONGTIME LAWYERS,

01:43.633 --> 01:44.367
JAY GOLDBERG, SEE IT VERY

01:44.367 --> 01:45.000
DIFFERENTLY.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.100
AND THE REASON I KNOW THIS IS,

01:46.100 --> 01:47.233
HE ARTICULATED THOSE CONCERNS ON

01:47.233 --> 01:48.500
TELEVISION IN THE CREEPIEST

01:48.500 --> 01:51.734
POSSIBLE WAY.

01:51.734 --> 01:53.700
>> WELL, HE IS OF A TYPE THAT

01:53.700 --> 01:56.333
I'VE RECOGNIZED IN THE PAST AS

01:56.333 --> 01:57.900
ONE NOT SUITED TO STAND UP TO

01:57.900 --> 02:02.433
THE RIGORS OF JAIL LIFE.

02:02.433 --> 02:05.633
I THINK IN MANY WAYS, AND IT'S

02:05.633 --> 02:08.033
DIFFICULT TO SAY THIS, PRISON

02:08.033 --> 02:12.000
HAS A RACIAL OVERTONE.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.600
AND A PERSON LIKE MICHAEL

02:14.600 --> 02:16.066
DOESN'T SEE HIMSELF WALKING DOWN

02:16.066 --> 02:17.867
BROADWAY WHILE PEOPLE ARE

02:17.867 --> 02:19.133
CLAMORING, "YOU'RE GOING TO BE

02:19.133 --> 02:23.100
MY WIFE."

02:23.100 --> 02:24.266
>> John: WHAT?

02:24.266 --> 02:30.734
I'M NOT REMOTELY SURPRISED THAT

02:30.734 --> 02:31.500
DONALD TRUMP HIRED HIM AS HIS

02:31.500 --> 02:32.300
LAWYER, BECAUSE IT TAKES A

02:32.300 --> 02:33.066
QUESTIONABLE LAWYER TO MAKE A

02:33.066 --> 02:33.934
PRISON RAPE JOKE.

02:33.934 --> 02:35.066
IT TAKES A DONALD TRUMP LAWYER

02:35.066 --> 02:36.233
TO SOMEHOW TURN THAT PRISON RAPE

02:36.233 --> 02:37.233
JOKE RACIST.

02:37.233 --> 02:40.333
BECAUSE HE'S IMPLYING THAT

02:40.333 --> 02:41.900
MICHAEL COHEN IS POTENTIALLY

02:41.900 --> 02:46.200
FINE WITH BEING SEXUAL ASSAULTED

02:46.200 --> 02:46.834
WERE IT NOT FOR THE RACIAL

02:46.834 --> 02:49.433
OVERTONES.

02:49.433 --> 02:50.233
BUT LET'S PUT THAT ASIDE AND

02:50.233 --> 02:55.767
FOCUS INSTEAD ON A LESSER-KNOWN

02:55.767 --> 02:57.000
MEMBER OF THE TRUMP CIRCUS,

02:57.000 --> 02:57.867
RYAN ZINKE, THE SECRETARY

02:57.867 --> 02:58.500
OF THE INTERIOR, A MAN DOING A

02:58.500 --> 02:59.600
JOB THAT TRUMP DEFINITELY FULLY

02:59.600 --> 03:00.200
UNDERSTANDS.

03:00.200 --> 03:01.133
>> I HAVE TO SAY, REALLY, TALK

03:01.133 --> 03:02.800
ABOUT A VERY SPECIAL GUY THAT I

03:02.800 --> 03:03.467
MADE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR.

03:03.467 --> 03:08.000
DOES HE KNOW THE INTERIOR.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.767
HE KNOWS IT, HE LOVES IT.

03:10.767 --> 03:12.100
HE LOVES SEEING IT

03:12.100 --> 03:13.367
AND RIDING ON IT.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.300
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU

03:14.300 --> 03:15.400
TALKING ABOUT?

03:15.400 --> 03:16.367
YOU SOUND LESS LIKE A PRESIDENT

03:16.367 --> 03:17.400
TRYING TO INTRODUCE A MEMBER OF

03:17.400 --> 03:18.233
HIS CABINET AND MORE LIKE GUY AT

03:18.233 --> 03:20.333
A YARD SALE TRYING TO SELL A

03:20.333 --> 03:22.667
COUCH THAT HE DEFINITELY FUCKED.

03:22.667 --> 03:23.734
"OH, DO I KNOW THIS COUCH?

03:23.734 --> 03:24.400
I LOVE THIS COUCH.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.266
I LOVE SEEING IT AND RIDING ON

03:25.266 --> 03:26.367
IT, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:26.367 --> 03:28.266
I JUST DECIDED SHE'S NOT FOR

03:28.266 --> 03:32.000
SALE.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.200
LEAVE US ALONE.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.433
GET OUT OF HERE.

03:34.433 --> 03:36.533
GIVE US SOME PRIVACY."

03:36.533 --> 03:37.300
ZINKE'S JOB IS TO SERVE AS A

03:37.300 --> 03:38.033
STEWARD OF AMERICA'S PUBLIC

03:38.033 --> 03:38.767
LANDS, ALTHOUGH SO FAR, HE'S

03:38.767 --> 03:39.767
OVERSEEN THE LARGEST REDUCTION

03:39.767 --> 03:40.500
OF FEDERAL LAND PROTECTION IN

03:40.500 --> 03:41.300
THE NATION'S HISTORY, INCLUDING

03:41.300 --> 03:42.400
REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE

03:42.400 --> 03:43.734
BEARS EARS MONUMENT IN UTAH,

03:43.734 --> 03:45.734
WHICH INCLUDED LAND SACRED TO

03:45.734 --> 03:47.200
LOCAL NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES, BY

03:47.200 --> 03:48.400
MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.700
AND WHILE MANY SAID THAT WAS A

03:49.700 --> 03:51.533
FAVOR TO OIL AND GAS INDUSTRIES,

03:51.533 --> 03:52.667
ZINKE USED HIS QUALIFICATIONS TO

03:52.667 --> 03:54.467
PUSH BACK HARD.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.867
>> I'M A GEOLOGIST.

03:56.867 --> 03:58.533
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT OIL AND

03:58.533 --> 04:00.300
GAS IN BEARS EARS WAS NOT PART

04:00.300 --> 04:04.333
OF MY DECISION MATRIX.

04:04.333 --> 04:07.600
A GEOLOGIST WILL TELL YOU THERE

04:07.600 --> 04:08.767
IS LITTLE, IF ANY, OIL AND GAS.

04:08.767 --> 04:09.734
NOW, THE GEOLOGY IS CLEAR ON

04:09.734 --> 04:12.266
THAT.

04:12.266 --> 04:15.934
>> John: NOW, YOU MIGHT'VE

04:15.934 --> 04:18.533
CAUGHT ZINKE THERE MENTIONING HE

04:18.533 --> 04:19.233
WAS A GEOLOGIST.

04:19.233 --> 04:21.266
IT'S SOMETHING HE'S SUGGESTED AT

04:21.266 --> 04:21.834
LEAST 40 TIMES IN PUBLIC,

04:21.834 --> 04:22.567
INCLUDING UNDER OATH BEFORE

04:22.567 --> 04:23.367
CONGRESS, WHICH MAKES IT A

04:23.367 --> 04:24.100
LITTLE AWKWARD THAT, THIS WEEK,

04:24.100 --> 04:25.166
IT EMERGED THAT RYAN ZINKE IS

04:25.166 --> 04:27.900
NOT, IN FACT, A GEOLOGIST.

04:27.900 --> 04:28.767
HE HAS NEVER BEEN A GEOLOGIST.

04:28.767 --> 04:30.300
WHAT HE DID DO WAS MAJOR IN

04:30.300 --> 04:33.333
GEOLOGY IN COLLEGE, WHICH

04:33.333 --> 04:34.233
DOES NOT MAKE YOU A GEOLOGIST.

04:34.233 --> 04:35.266
ALL IT DOES IS QUALIFY YOU TO

04:35.266 --> 04:36.233
WATCH THE MOVIE "SAN ANDREAS"

04:36.233 --> 04:37.700
AND WHISPER TO YOUR FRIEND,

04:37.700 --> 04:40.867
"IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN LIKE THAT."

04:40.867 --> 04:42.367
AND ZINKE ACTUALLY HAS A PATTERN

04:42.367 --> 04:42.967
OF INFLATING THE IMPORTANCE OF

04:42.967 --> 04:43.934
PAST GLORIES, NO MATTER HOW

04:43.934 --> 04:44.967
INSIGNIFICANT.

04:44.967 --> 04:46.166
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN HE RAN FOR

04:46.166 --> 04:48.867
CONGRESS, HE BOASTED ABOUT THIS.

04:48.867 --> 04:50.000
>> I WAS HIGH SCHOOL PRESIDENT

04:50.000 --> 04:51.333
AND WE WENT UNDEFEATED OUR

04:51.333 --> 04:52.166
SENIOR YEAR IN FOOTBALL, WON THE

04:52.166 --> 04:54.333
STATE CHAMPIONSHIP.

04:54.333 --> 04:56.700
AMERICA.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.800
>> John: WHAT WAS THAT?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.633
IT WOULD HAVE MADE JUST AS MUCH

05:01.633 --> 05:03.233
SENSE IF HE HAD SAID, "I WEIGHED

05:03.233 --> 05:04.734
6.5 POUNDS WHEN I WAS BORN, AND

05:04.734 --> 05:05.767
I ONCE ATE A QUESADILLA BURGER

05:05.767 --> 05:06.900
AT APPLEBEE'S.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.433
BOLIVIA."

05:09.433 --> 05:12.633
AND LOOK, ALL POLITICIANS

05:12.633 --> 05:14.834
SELF-MYTHOLOGIZE.

05:14.834 --> 05:16.600
OF COURSE.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.166
BUT ZINKE HAS A REAL FLAIR FOR

05:19.166 --> 05:19.967
CREATIVE LICENSE.

05:19.967 --> 05:20.867
FOR EXAMPLE, HE SERVED AS A

05:20.867 --> 05:21.667
NAVY SEAL, WHICH IS GENUINELY

05:21.667 --> 05:22.567
IMPRESSIVE.

05:22.567 --> 05:23.667
BUT HERE'S HOW HIS SERVICE WAS

05:23.667 --> 05:24.633
DESCRIBED IN AN AD FOR HIS BOOK.

05:24.633 --> 05:25.967
>> ZINKE ROSE THROUGH THE RANKS

05:25.967 --> 05:27.166
TO BE A COMMANDER AT THE SAME

05:27.166 --> 05:29.300
SEAL TEAM THAT KILLED BIN LADEN,

05:29.300 --> 05:31.367
SAVED CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, AND

05:31.367 --> 05:33.900
RESCUED THE LONE SURVIVOR.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.166
>> John: NOW, TO BE CLEAR, ZINKE

05:35.166 --> 05:36.433
RETIRED AS A MEMBER OF THAT SEAL

05:36.433 --> 05:37.900
TEAM 10 YEARS BEFORE IT SAVED

05:37.900 --> 05:39.266
CAPTAIN PHILLIPS AND 12 YEARS

05:39.266 --> 05:40.967
BEFORE IT KILLED BIN LADEN.

05:40.967 --> 05:42.066
BUT ZINKE HAS ACTIVELY BLURRED

05:42.066 --> 05:43.633
THOSE LINES.

05:43.633 --> 05:44.734
HE ONCE SENT OUT THIS

05:44.734 --> 05:46.300
CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN

05:46.300 --> 05:47.500
FUNDRAISING EMAIL CITING HIS

05:47.500 --> 05:48.533
TIME AS A SEAL WITH

05:48.533 --> 05:50.266
THE SUBJECT LINE,

05:50.266 --> 05:51.700
"WHO KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN?"

05:51.700 --> 05:52.834
WHICH IS ONLY A FAIR TITLE IF

05:52.834 --> 05:54.033
THE EMAIL GOES ON TO SAY,

05:54.033 --> 05:55.400
"DEFINITELY NOT ME.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.233
YOU MUST BE THINKING OF SOMEONE

05:56.233 --> 05:57.233
ELSE.

05:57.233 --> 05:59.266
BUT HE SOUNDS GREAT, AND YOU

05:59.266 --> 06:00.367
SHOULD PROBABLY VOTE FOR

06:00.367 --> 06:02.433
THAT GUY FOR CONGRESS."

06:02.433 --> 06:06.633
NOW, ZINKE, IT TURNS OUT, MIGHT

06:06.633 --> 06:07.600
BE A VERY, VERY WEIRD MAN.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.633
FOR INSTANCE, SINCE BECOMING

06:08.633 --> 06:09.433
SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, HE'S

06:09.433 --> 06:10.400
HAD HIS OWN SPECIAL FLAG FLY

06:10.400 --> 06:11.667
OUTSIDE THE HEADQUARTERS

06:11.667 --> 06:12.533
WHENEVER HE'S IN THE BUILDING,

06:12.533 --> 06:17.166
WHICH SEEMS UNNECESSARY.

06:17.166 --> 06:18.033
BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING

06:18.033 --> 06:18.767
THE QUEEN DOES.

06:18.767 --> 06:19.734
HE'S ALSO COMMISSIONED HIS OWN

06:19.734 --> 06:20.734
COMMEMORATIVE COINS WITH HIS

06:20.734 --> 06:21.467
NAME ON THEM TO GIVE TO STAFF

06:21.467 --> 06:25.533
AND VISITORS.

06:25.533 --> 06:27.033
AND WHY WOULD THEY WANT ONE OF

06:27.033 --> 06:27.233
THOSE?

06:27.233 --> 06:28.166
WHO WANTS A ZINKE BUCK?

06:28.166 --> 06:29.066
I BELIEVE THE CURRENT EXCHANGE

06:29.066 --> 06:30.033
RATE FOR THEM IS "HERE, TAKE IT.

06:30.033 --> 06:31.834
I DON'T WANT IT.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.767
THE GUY'S NOT EVEN A GEOLOGIST."

06:33.767 --> 06:35.500
AND JUST LAST YEAR, WATCH WHAT

06:35.500 --> 06:36.734
HAPPENED AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY FOR

06:36.734 --> 06:38.200
A MONTANA CANDIDATE WHEN

06:38.200 --> 06:39.967
KAREN PENCE HAD THE UNFORTUNATE

06:39.967 --> 06:41.133
LUCK TO BE STANDING NEXT TO

06:41.133 --> 06:43.667
ZINKE WHEN THE MUSIC STARTED.

06:43.667 --> 06:45.667
>> ♪ ONE KID DREAMS OF FAME

06:45.667 --> 06:50.567
AND FORTUNE ♪

06:50.567 --> 07:02.333
♪ ONE KID HELPS PAY THE RENT ♪

07:02.333 --> 07:03.367
>> John: OH, MY GOD.

07:03.367 --> 07:04.433
THE CRAZY PART ISN'T EVEN THAT

07:04.433 --> 07:05.767
HE LIFTED UP THE

07:05.767 --> 07:06.800
VICE PRESIDENT'S WIFE WITHOUT

07:06.800 --> 07:07.934
HER PERMISSION AND THREW HER

07:07.934 --> 07:08.900
AROUND LIKE A SACK OF

07:08.900 --> 07:09.734
UNBLEACHED FLOUR.

07:09.734 --> 07:12.767
NO.

07:12.767 --> 07:16.600
THE TRULY CRAZY PART IS, NO

07:16.600 --> 07:21.033
ONE ELSE WAS DANCING THERE!

07:21.033 --> 07:24.900
SO THAT, ADDED TO CORE, IS

07:24.900 --> 07:25.200
RYAN ZINKE.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.033
YOU MAY NOT HAVE EVEN HEARD OF

07:26.033 --> 07:27.100
HIM BEFORE TONIGHT, BUT HE'S AN

07:27.100 --> 07:27.734
IMPORTANT, DEEPLY STRANGE MAN.

07:27.734 --> 07:28.567
IF I MAY SUM HIM UP THE WAY HE

07:28.567 --> 07:29.467
WOULD IN A CAMPAIGN AD, ZINKE IS

07:29.467 --> 07:30.533
AN OIL-FRIENDLY,

07:30.533 --> 07:32.066
COIN-COMMISSIONING,

07:32.066 --> 07:34.967
NON-BIN-LADEN-KILLING WEIRDO WHO

07:34.967 --> 07:35.934
THROWS SECOND LADIES AROUND,

07:35.934 --> 07:37.767
AND HE IS NOT A FUCKING

07:37.767 --> 07:39.333
GEOLOGIST, AMERICA.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.667
AND NOW THIS.

07:41.667 --> 07:46.734
>> Announcer: AND NOW,

07:46.734 --> 07:48.300
SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL RYAN ZINKE

07:48.300 --> 07:50.834
HE IS NOT A GEOLOGIST.

07:50.834 --> 07:53.367
>> MANAGEMENT DECISIONS SHOULD

07:53.367 --> 07:55.367
BE BASED ON OBJECTIVE SCIENCE.

07:55.367 --> 07:59.567
AS A GEOLOGIST, THAT'S STEP ONE.

07:59.567 --> 08:03.000
FROM A POINT OF VIEW OF A

08:03.000 --> 08:04.767
GEOLOGIST.

08:04.767 --> 08:06.400
FROM A GEOLOGIST'S POINT OF

08:06.400 --> 08:06.600
VIEW.

08:06.600 --> 08:07.100
AS A GEOLOGIST.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.400
>> I'M A FORMER GEOLOGIST.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.734
>> I'M A FORMER GEOLOGIST.

08:10.734 --> 08:15.800
>> I'M A FORMER GEOLOGIST.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.867
THAT'S THE QUESTION TO ASK.

08:16.867 --> 08:17.333
AND I'M A GEOLOGIST.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.967
I'M A FORMER GEOLOGIST.

08:18.967 --> 08:19.667
I'M A GEOLOGIST.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.934
I'M A GEOLOGIST.

08:20.934 --> 08:21.767
I'M A GEOLOGIST.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.300
I'M A GEOLOGIST.

08:23.300 --> 08:24.934
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:24.934 --> 08:26.033
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT INVOLVES

08:26.033 --> 08:27.367
DIPLOMACY, THE THING THAT KEEPS

08:27.367 --> 08:28.266
US FROM IMMEDIATELY GOING TO WAR

08:28.266 --> 08:29.300
WITH OUR ENEMIES AND FROM

08:29.300 --> 08:30.567
TELLING LIECHTENSTEIN HOW WE

08:30.567 --> 08:31.867
REALLY FEEL.

08:31.867 --> 08:33.000
YOU ARE A SNOBBY POLYP ON

08:33.000 --> 08:34.166
SWITZERLAND, AND THEY SHOULD

08:34.166 --> 08:37.233
HAVE YOU REMOVED IMMEDIATELY.

08:37.233 --> 08:38.667
IT IS A BUSY TIME FOR DIPLOMACY

08:38.667 --> 08:40.300
IN THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE, WHAT

08:40.300 --> 08:41.633
WITH THEM PLANNING THE

08:41.633 --> 08:42.567
NORTH KOREA SUMMIT, WEIGHING

08:42.567 --> 08:44.133
WHAT TO DO ABOUT SYRIA, AND A

08:44.133 --> 08:45.000
STATE VISIT WITH MACRON NEXT

08:45.000 --> 08:46.367
WEEK.

08:46.367 --> 08:50.400
NONE OF WHICH IS HELPED BY THE

08:50.400 --> 08:52.033
FACT THAT NO ONE HAS SEEN JARED

08:52.033 --> 08:52.867
IN MONTHS.

08:52.867 --> 08:54.000
WHERE IS JARED?

08:54.000 --> 08:54.967
HOW CAN WE MAKE CRUCIAL FOREIGN

08:54.967 --> 08:55.967
POLICY DECISIONS WITHOUT THE

08:55.967 --> 08:57.533
WHITE HOUSE'S GOODEST BOY?

08:57.533 --> 08:58.600
AND ON TOP OF ALL THAT, THERE'S

08:58.600 --> 08:59.633
ACTUALLY A MASSIVE DECISION THAT

08:59.633 --> 09:00.834
TRUMP HAS TO MAKE JUST AROUND

09:00.834 --> 09:02.700
THE CORNER.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.266
>> THE IRAN DEAL IS COMING UP.

09:04.266 --> 09:05.433
>> AFTER MONTHS OF WILL-HE,

09:05.433 --> 09:07.033
WON'T-HE RHETORIC, THE NUCLEAR

09:07.033 --> 09:11.166
DEAL IS ON THE PRESIDENT'S MIND

09:11.166 --> 09:12.033
ONCE AGAIN THIS WEEK AS HE

09:12.033 --> 09:12.834
FACES A MAY 12TH DEADLINE TO

09:12.834 --> 09:14.200
DECIDE WHETHER TO RECERTIFY IT.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.500
THERE'S A GROWING CONSENSUS THAT

09:15.500 --> 09:16.333
THIS TIME AROUND IT MAY FINALLY

09:16.333 --> 09:20.834
BE DEAD ONCE AND FOR ALL.

09:20.834 --> 09:22.834
>> John: WELL, THAT IS NOT A

09:22.834 --> 09:24.533
GOOD SIGN FOR THE IRAN DEAL,

09:24.533 --> 09:25.433
BECAUSE WHENEVER THERE'S A

09:25.433 --> 09:26.433
WILL HE-WON'T HE QUESTION

09:26.433 --> 09:27.300
REGARDING TRUMP, YOU CAN

09:27.300 --> 09:28.033
GUARANTEE HE'LL PICK THE WORST

09:28.033 --> 09:28.734
POSSIBLE OPTION.

09:28.734 --> 09:29.433
"WILL HE PULL THE U.S. OUT OF

09:29.433 --> 09:30.500
THE PARIS ACCORD?"

09:30.500 --> 09:30.834
HE DID.

09:30.834 --> 09:31.633
"WILL HE TRY TO BAN MUSLIMS FROM

09:31.633 --> 09:32.300
ENTERING THE COUNTRY?"

09:32.300 --> 09:33.066
HE DID.

09:33.066 --> 09:34.166
WILL HE LOOK DIRECTLY INTO THE

09:34.166 --> 09:35.934
SUN DURING THE SOLAR ECLIPSE

09:35.934 --> 09:42.467
WHILE POINTING AT IT AS IF TO

09:42.467 --> 09:43.233
SAY, "LOOK, THE SUN."

09:43.233 --> 09:43.967
HE DID.

09:43.967 --> 09:44.834
OF COURSE HE DID.

09:44.834 --> 09:48.867
AND TRUMP HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR

09:48.867 --> 09:49.433
HOW HE FEELS ABOUT THE IRAN

09:49.433 --> 09:49.934
DEAL.

09:49.934 --> 09:50.734
HE'S CALLED IT "TERRIBLE,"

09:50.734 --> 09:51.533
"A CATASTROPHE," "STUPID,"

09:51.533 --> 09:52.266
"INSANE," "INCOMPETENT,"

09:52.266 --> 09:53.033
"REALLY SAD," "HORRIBLE,"

09:53.033 --> 09:53.867
"HORRENDOUS," "HORRIBLE,"

09:53.867 --> 09:54.633
"HORRIBLE," "TERRIBLE,"

09:54.633 --> 09:55.667
"INCOMPETENT," AND

09:55.667 --> 09:56.700
"ONE OF THE DUMBEST AND MOST

09:56.700 --> 09:59.967
DANGEROUS MISJUDGMENTS EVER."

09:59.967 --> 10:00.867
WHICH IS, COINCIDENTALLY, ALSO

10:00.867 --> 10:02.300
EXACTLY WHAT TRUMP WRITES IN

10:02.300 --> 10:04.367
DON JR.'S BIRTHDAY CARD

10:04.367 --> 10:07.033
EVERY YEAR,

10:07.033 --> 10:10.233
AS IS APPROPRIATE.

10:10.233 --> 10:10.934
AND THOSE CRITICISMS ARE JUST

10:10.934 --> 10:12.033
THE TIP OF A VERY LARGE ICEBERG.

10:12.033 --> 10:12.667
>> I THINK IT'S THE WORST DEAL

10:12.667 --> 10:13.166
I'VE EVER SEEN.

10:13.166 --> 10:14.033
IT'S THE WORST DEAL I'VE EVER

10:14.033 --> 10:15.200
SEEN NEGOTIATED.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.300
MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO

10:16.300 --> 10:17.333
DISMANTLE THE DISASTROUS DEAL

10:17.333 --> 10:18.967
WITH IRAN.

10:18.967 --> 10:20.133
THIS IS THE WORST DEAL.

10:20.133 --> 10:21.133
WE'VE GOT NOTHING.

10:21.133 --> 10:21.934
WE'VE GOT NOTHING.

10:21.934 --> 10:23.300
THEY HAVE SO OUTNEGOTIATED OUR

10:23.300 --> 10:24.233
PEOPLE.

10:24.233 --> 10:25.600
BECAUSE OUR PEOPLE ARE BABIES,

10:25.600 --> 10:26.233
THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'RE

10:26.233 --> 10:26.967
DOING.

10:26.967 --> 10:28.433
THEY WILL FIND OUT THAT IF I WIN

10:28.433 --> 10:29.533
WE'RE NOT BABIES.

10:29.533 --> 10:30.767
THERE'S NO MORE BEING BABIES

10:30.767 --> 10:32.834
ANYMORE.

10:32.834 --> 10:33.834
>> John: OH, THAT'S RIGHT, IRAN.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.200
THERE'S NO MORE BEING BABIES

10:35.200 --> 10:37.400
ANYMORE.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.233
WE'RE DONE WEARING PULL-UPS AND

10:38.233 --> 10:39.467
GOING TINKLE IN OUR OSHKOSH.

10:39.467 --> 10:40.333
WE CAN PUT OUR OWN STRAW IN OUR

10:40.333 --> 10:41.500
JUICE BOX, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

10:41.500 --> 10:42.767
BECAUSE WE ARE BIG BOYS AND WE

10:42.767 --> 10:44.133
HAVE SHOES WITH LACES AND ALSO A

10:44.133 --> 10:44.967
BIKE THAT HAS SPIDERMAN ON IT

10:44.967 --> 10:46.367
THAT OUR UNCLE JIM GOT US FOR

10:46.367 --> 10:47.333
CHRISTMAS, BECAUSE WE ARE

10:47.333 --> 10:48.100
BIG BOYS, AND THERE'S NO MORE

10:48.100 --> 10:51.600
BEING BABIES ANYMORE.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.533
NO MORE.

10:54.533 --> 10:55.734
AND MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS DEAL

10:55.734 --> 11:00.133
DYING COULD HAVE HUGE, LASTING

11:00.133 --> 11:02.066
CONSEQUENCES, WHICH MAKES IT A

11:02.066 --> 11:03.900
LITTLE ODD THAT NOBODY'S REALLY

11:03.900 --> 11:07.467
PAYING MUCH ATTENTION TO THE

11:07.467 --> 11:09.200
FACT THAT, ON MAY 12, IF TRUMP

11:09.200 --> 11:11.066
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THIS DEAL HAS

11:11.066 --> 11:12.934
BEEN FIXED TO HIS LIKING, HE MAY

11:12.934 --> 11:14.400
REFUSE TO WAIVE A KEY SANCTION,

11:14.400 --> 11:15.567
WHICH COULD THREATEN THE ENTIRE

11:15.567 --> 11:18.967
THING.

11:18.967 --> 11:19.734
SO TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK AT THE

11:19.734 --> 11:20.400
IRAN DEAL: WHAT IT IS, WHY TRUMP

11:20.400 --> 11:21.600
HATES IT SO MUCH, AND WHAT'S

11:21.600 --> 11:22.233
LIKELY TO HAPPEN IF HE KILLS IT.

11:22.233 --> 11:22.867
AND TO START, IT HELPS TO KNOW

11:22.867 --> 11:23.934
JUST A LITTLE OF THE HISTORY

11:23.934 --> 11:24.700
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND IRAN, WHICH

11:24.700 --> 11:25.567
HAS BEEN FRAUGHT, TO SAY THE

11:25.567 --> 11:26.300
LEAST.

11:26.300 --> 11:27.000
HERE IS A LUDICROUSLY BRIEF

11:27.000 --> 11:28.066
RECAP: IN 1953, THE CIA HELPED

11:28.066 --> 11:29.066
ORCHESTRATE A COUP TO DEPOSE

11:29.066 --> 11:29.867
IRAN'S DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED

11:29.867 --> 11:31.000
PRIME MINISTER, REPLACING HIM

11:31.000 --> 11:33.100
WITH THE SHAH, WHO WAS FRIENDLY

11:33.100 --> 11:34.133
TO THE U.S., AND TO WHOM,

11:34.133 --> 11:34.867
FUNNY STORY, WE SUPPLIED WEAPONS

11:34.867 --> 11:44.000
AND A NUCLEAR REACTOR.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.100
HE WAS OVERTHROWN IN A

11:45.100 --> 11:49.133
REVOLUTION IN 1979,

11:49.133 --> 11:51.600
AND DOZENS OF AMERICAN DIPLOMATS

11:51.600 --> 11:52.000
WERE HELD HOSTAGE.

11:52.000 --> 11:52.433
EVENTUALLY, THE

11:52.433 --> 11:53.200
AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI TOOK POWER,

11:53.200 --> 11:53.800
CONVERTING THE COUNTRY TO AN

11:53.800 --> 11:54.500
ISLAMIC THEOCRACY.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.266
THAT'S AN INSULTINGLY BRIEF

11:55.266 --> 11:55.900
HISTORY OF THE LAST 60 YEARS

11:55.900 --> 11:56.500
ALONE, AND THERE'S A LOT I'VE

11:56.500 --> 11:57.133
LEFT OUT, BUT IF YOU WANT TO

11:57.133 --> 11:57.867
LEARN MORE, SUBSCRIBE TO MY NEW

11:57.867 --> 11:58.767
PODCAST, "TALKIN' TEHRAN

WITH JOHN OLIVER AND

11:59.734 --> 12:02.734
JAMES VAN DER BEEK."

12:02.734 --> 12:03.734
HERE'S JUST A SMALL TASTE.

12:03.734 --> 12:04.867
>> LET'S PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT

12:04.867 --> 12:07.934
OFF, WITH THE PRIVATIZATION OF

12:07.934 --> 12:14.467
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES IN IRAN.

12:14.467 --> 12:16.667
>> John: YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

12:16.667 --> 12:18.467
THE WORK OF RAFSANJANI?

12:18.467 --> 12:19.233
>> NO, I'M NOT TALKING

12:19.233 --> 12:20.000
ABOUT THAT, JOHN.

12:20.000 --> 12:20.967
YOU DO THIS EVERY FUCKING TIME.

12:20.967 --> 12:21.433
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE

12:21.433 --> 12:21.934
UNDERAPPRECIATED ROLE OF

12:21.934 --> 12:22.533
MODERATES LIKE MEHDI BAZARGAN.

12:22.533 --> 12:22.967
>> John: OH, PLEASE,

12:22.967 --> 12:23.600
VAN DER BEEK, YOU'RE THUMPING ON

12:23.600 --> 12:24.133
AGAIN ABOUT MODERATES LIKE

12:24.133 --> 12:25.000
MEHDI BAZARGAN.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
>> SHUT UP!

12:26.000 --> 12:26.500
SHUT UP!

12:26.500 --> 12:27.433
THEY NEVER GOT THE CREDIT THEY

12:27.433 --> 12:28.667
DESERVED!

12:28.667 --> 12:29.567
RAFSANJANI WAS A GLORY HUNTER!

12:29.567 --> 12:30.200
>> John: RAFSANJANI WAS THE GLUE

12:30.200 --> 12:30.767
THAT KEPT THE WHOLE THING

12:30.767 --> 12:31.433
TOGETHER!

12:31.433 --> 12:32.967
HOW DARE YOU!

12:32.967 --> 12:35.133
>> WITHOUT THE BACKING OF

12:35.133 --> 12:36.233
THE MODERATES, HE WAS NOTHING.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.066
WE NEED TO DO AN AD FOR

12:37.066 --> 12:38.100
MAILCHIMP RIGHT NOW.

12:38.100 --> 12:38.967
JOHN, DO YOU SEND A LOT OF MASS

12:38.967 --> 12:39.700
EMAILS?

12:39.700 --> 12:40.633
>> John: IT'S A PRETTY GOOD

12:40.633 --> 12:43.200
PODCAST.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.367
IT'S PRETTY GOOD.

12:44.367 --> 12:45.333
AND IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW

12:45.333 --> 12:46.400
JAMES VAN DER BEEK WAS AN EXPERT

12:46.400 --> 12:47.233
IN IRANIAN HISTORY, EXPAND YOUR

12:47.233 --> 12:48.333
EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE

12:48.333 --> 12:51.000
CAPABLE OF.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.467
BUT THE POINT IS,

12:52.467 --> 12:53.633
IN MANY AMERICANS' MINDS,

12:53.633 --> 12:54.500
IRAN'S IMAGE IS REDUCED TO A

12:54.500 --> 12:56.066
PLACE WHERE U.S. FLAGS ARE SET

12:56.066 --> 12:56.700
ON FIRE AND THERE ARE CHANTS OF

12:56.700 --> 13:01.000
"DEATH TO AMERICA."

13:01.000 --> 13:01.767
AND THE TRUTH IS, THAT IS STILL

13:01.767 --> 13:02.533
PART OF IRANIAN POLITICAL

13:02.533 --> 13:03.367
CULTURE.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.300
MUCH OF THE POWER IN THE COUNTRY

13:04.300 --> 13:05.033
IS HELD BY CONSERVATIVE CLERICS

13:05.033 --> 13:05.834
WHO FORCE RELIGIOUS COMPLIANCE

13:05.834 --> 13:06.633
AT HOME AND PURSUE AN AGGRESSIVE

13:06.633 --> 13:10.700
FOREIGN POLICY ABROAD.

13:10.700 --> 13:11.533
THEY ARE WIDELY BELIEVED TO BE

13:11.533 --> 13:12.533
SUPPORTING THE HOUTHI REBELS IN

13:12.533 --> 13:13.867
YEMEN AND BASHAR AL-ASSAD IN

13:13.867 --> 13:14.500
SYRIA AND ARE A MAJOR FUNDER OF

13:14.500 --> 13:15.333
THE TERRORIST GROUP HEZBOLLAH,

13:15.333 --> 13:16.400
AND THE CURRENT AYATOLLAH IS

13:16.400 --> 13:19.033
STILL SAYING STUFF LIKE THIS.

13:19.100 --> 13:22.767
>> BY GOD'S FAVOR AND GRACE,

13:22.767 --> 13:24.166
NOTHING CALLED THE ZIONIST

13:24.166 --> 13:26.433
REGIME WILL EXIST IN THE REGION

13:26.433 --> 13:28.066
BY 25 YEARS FROM NOW.

13:28.066 --> 13:31.033
>> John: OKAY, IT'S NOT THE MOST

13:31.033 --> 13:32.133
IMPORTANT PART, BUT THE

13:32.133 --> 13:33.333
COUNTRY'S NAME IS "ISRAEL," NOT

13:33.333 --> 13:34.300
"THE ZIONIST REGIME."

13:34.300 --> 13:35.133
IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE

13:35.133 --> 13:36.266
APPALLING THREATS AGAINST A

13:36.266 --> 13:37.367
NATION, AT LEAST GET THEIR NAME

13:37.367 --> 13:41.266
RIGHT.

13:41.266 --> 13:42.133
I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT

13:42.133 --> 13:42.934
IF I CALLED IRAN

13:42.934 --> 13:44.000
"OLD PAPPY KHAMENEI'S

13:44.000 --> 13:49.133
PALACE O' PERSIANS," WOULD YOU?

13:49.133 --> 13:52.400
NO, YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.533
YOU WOULDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

13:54.533 --> 13:55.333
BUT THE TRUTH IS, THAT'S ONLY

13:55.333 --> 13:56.500
PART OF THE PICTURE OF IRAN.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.133
THERE'S ALSO A LARGE, EDUCATED,

13:57.133 --> 13:57.767
RELATIVELY LIBERAL MIDDLE CLASS,

13:57.767 --> 13:58.367
AMONG WHOM OPINIONS OF AMERICA

13:58.367 --> 13:59.066
TEND TO BE CONSIDERABLY MORE

13:59.066 --> 13:59.734
POSITIVE.

13:59.734 --> 14:00.433
YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE FACT THEY

14:00.433 --> 14:01.567
HAVE KNOCK-OFFS OF AMERICAN

14:01.567 --> 14:05.066
RESTAURANTS CALLED

14:05.066 --> 14:05.767
"MASH DONALD'S," "ZFC," AND

14:05.767 --> 14:06.567
"PIZZA HAT," WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY

14:06.567 --> 14:08.333
DIRECT RIP-OFFS OF

14:08.333 --> 14:09.300
MARSH DONALD'S, ZFG, AND

14:09.300 --> 14:12.700
PIZZA HAL.

14:12.700 --> 14:13.600
AND IRAN'S CURRENT PRESIDENT,

14:13.600 --> 14:14.934
HASSAN ROUHANI, IS RELATIVELY

14:14.934 --> 14:16.734
MODERATE BY IRANIAN STANDARDS,

14:16.734 --> 14:18.767
EVEN GOING SO FAR AS TO TWEET A

14:18.767 --> 14:20.700
FEW YEARS BACK, "I WISH ALL

14:20.700 --> 14:22.567
JEWS, ESPECIALLY IRANIAN JEWS,

14:22.567 --> 14:23.667
A BLESSED ROSH HASHANNAH."

14:23.667 --> 14:25.233
AND WHEN AN IRANIAN LEADER

14:25.233 --> 14:27.500
BEGINS A STATEMENT WITH THE

14:27.500 --> 14:28.867
WORDS "I WISH ALL JEWS,"

14:28.867 --> 14:33.934
AND ACTUALLY STICKS THE LANDING,

14:33.934 --> 14:34.967
YOU KIND OF HAVE TO HAND IT TO

14:34.967 --> 14:38.166
HIM THERE.

14:38.166 --> 14:39.033
AND PRO-WESTERN VIEWS ARE

14:39.033 --> 14:39.767
PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED AMONG

14:39.767 --> 14:40.600
YOUNG PEOPLE BORN AFTER THE

14:40.600 --> 14:41.700
REVOLUTION.

14:41.700 --> 14:42.867
IN FACT, A FEW YEARS BACK,

14:42.867 --> 14:44.000
"THRASHER" MAGAZINE -- MY

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
FAVORITE SKATEBOARD MAGAZINE --

14:45.000 --> 14:45.967
DID A STORY ON IRANIAN

14:45.967 --> 14:46.934
SKATEBOARDING CULTURE, WHICH HAS

14:46.934 --> 14:47.934
THRIVED, DESPITE ONE

14:47.934 --> 14:50.800
CONSIDERABLE OBSTACLE.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.066
>> IRAN IS UNDER SANCTIONS RIGHT

14:52.066 --> 14:53.800
NOW, AND IT'S REALLY HARD FOR

14:53.800 --> 14:55.233
THEM TO IMPORT ANYTHING FROM THE

14:55.233 --> 14:56.467
WEST.

14:56.467 --> 14:57.734
THIS KIND OF PUT THE SKATERS IN

14:57.734 --> 15:00.133
A POSITION WHERE THEY WERE

15:00.133 --> 15:02.066
ACTUALLY FORCED TO FIGURE OUT A

15:02.066 --> 15:03.100
WAY TO MAKE THEIR OWN BOARDS.

15:03.100 --> 15:04.333
>> WE SAW ONE KID SKATING A

15:04.333 --> 15:05.367
BOARD MADE OF SOLID STEEL, WHICH

15:05.367 --> 15:07.100
IS KIND OF CRAZY.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.433
IT'S AN IRANIAN SKATEBOARD AND

15:08.433 --> 15:12.200
IT'S MADE OF METAL.

15:12.467 --> 15:13.567
SOLID.

15:13.567 --> 15:16.333
THIS IS GONNA LAST FOREVER.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.200
>> John: SICK DECK, BRAH.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.834
ALTHOUGH IF IT WAS ME, I'D

15:19.834 --> 15:21.500
DOUBLE UP THE GRIP TAPE ON MY

15:21.500 --> 15:22.967
TOPSHEET SO I DON'T SLAM WHEN I

15:22.967 --> 15:25.233
GO SKETCHY ON A NOSE GRIND.

15:25.233 --> 15:26.200
I DO HOPE YOU ENJOYED THAT JOKE,

15:26.200 --> 15:27.266
BECAUSE IT TOOK ONE OF MY

15:27.266 --> 15:28.133
WRITERS 50 FUCKING MINUTES ON

15:28.133 --> 15:30.200
THE SKATEBOARDING WIKIPEDIA PAGE

15:30.200 --> 15:33.200
TO RESEARCH IT.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.633
BOUNCED TRUE.

15:36.633 --> 15:40.567
-- THAT'S TRUE

15:40.567 --> 15:41.800
BUT THOSE SANCTIONS ARE ACTUALLY

15:41.800 --> 15:42.433
ONE OF THE REASONS THE IRAN DEAL

15:42.433 --> 15:43.700
HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:43.700 --> 15:44.300
BECAUSE WHEN THE INTERNATIONAL

15:44.300 --> 15:45.266
COMMUNITY DISCOVERED THAT IRAN

15:45.266 --> 15:46.133
WAS SECRETLY BUILDING NUCLEAR

15:46.133 --> 15:47.300
FACILITIES, IT WAS

15:47.300 --> 15:48.166
UNDERSTANDABLY CONCERNED AND

15:48.166 --> 15:49.700
IMPOSED CRIPPLING SANCTIONS

15:49.700 --> 15:50.300
AFFECTING EVERY PART OF IRAN'S

15:50.300 --> 15:51.200
ECONOMY, FROM OIL TO PLANE PARTS

15:51.200 --> 15:52.467
TO BANKING AND INVESTMENT.

15:52.467 --> 15:53.734
ONE KEY MOTIVATOR IN IRAN COMING

15:53.734 --> 15:54.900
TO THE TABLE TO NEGOTIATE WAS

15:54.900 --> 15:56.266
RELAXING SOME OF THOSE

15:56.266 --> 15:57.533
SANCTIONS.

15:57.533 --> 15:59.400
AND THEY GOT THAT.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.066
ALL THE PARTNERS IN THIS DEAL --

16:01.066 --> 16:02.900
THE U.S., BRITAIN, FRANCE,

16:02.900 --> 16:05.033
GERMANY, THE E.U., RUSSIA, AND

16:05.033 --> 16:06.200
CHINA -- AGREED TO LIFT SPECIFIC

16:06.200 --> 16:07.867
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON IRAN.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.567
SO THAT'S WHAT IRAN GOT OUT OF

16:10.567 --> 16:12.600
THIS DEAL.

16:12.600 --> 16:14.367
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS, WHAT

16:14.367 --> 16:15.300
DID WE GET?

16:15.300 --> 16:16.400
AND THE ANSWER IS, QUITE A LOT.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.500
>> IT REQUIRES IRAN NOT TO

16:17.500 --> 16:18.934
ENRICH URANIUM TO WEAPONS-GRADE

16:18.934 --> 16:20.700
FOR 15 YEARS, TO REDUCE ITS

16:20.700 --> 16:22.967
NUMBER OF OPERATING NUCLEAR

16:22.967 --> 16:24.567
CENTRIFUGES FROM 19,000 TO JUST

16:24.567 --> 16:26.066
OVER 5,000, AND TO INCREASE THE

16:26.066 --> 16:27.567
TIME IT WOULD TAKE TO MAKE A

16:27.567 --> 16:28.300
BOMB FROM A FEW MONTHS TO A

16:28.300 --> 16:29.800
YEAR.

16:29.800 --> 16:30.867
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

16:30.867 --> 16:32.000
AND THOSE WERE BIG CONCESSIONS

16:32.000 --> 16:33.233
FROM IRAN.

16:33.233 --> 16:35.133
THE DEAL REQUIRED THEM TO REDUCE

16:35.133 --> 16:37.000
THEIR STOCKPILE OF URANIUM BY

16:37.000 --> 16:40.300
98% AND MANDATED THAT THEY WOULD

16:40.300 --> 16:42.100
NOT ENRICH URANIUM ABOVE 3.67%,

16:42.100 --> 16:43.834
WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER

16:43.834 --> 16:45.400
THAN THE 90% NEEDED FOR WEAPONS.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.000
AND TRYING TO MAKE A BOMB AT

16:48.000 --> 16:52.767
UNDER 4% ENRICHMENT IS LIKE

16:52.767 --> 16:53.700
TRYING TO GET DRUNK OFF A

16:53.700 --> 16:55.300
SINGLE CAN OF PBR.

16:55.300 --> 16:58.233
YOU CAN'T.

16:58.233 --> 16:59.834
IT CANNOT BE DONE.

16:59.834 --> 17:00.433
THERE'S JUST NO FUCKING WAY TO

17:00.433 --> 17:01.433
DO IT.

17:01.433 --> 17:02.467
NOT UNLESS YOU'RE A GERBIL.

17:02.467 --> 17:03.166
AND EVEN THEN, ONLY IF YOU'RE

17:03.166 --> 17:05.266
DRINKING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

17:05.266 --> 17:06.400
AND, LOOK, THAT'S NOT ALL.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.233
THE DEAL ALSO HAD STRICT

17:07.233 --> 17:08.533
CONDITIONS FOR MONITORING AND

17:08.533 --> 17:09.500
VERIFICATION TO MAKE SURE THEY

17:09.500 --> 17:10.767
WERE IN COMPLIANCE.

17:10.767 --> 17:12.467
AND IF THEY WEREN'T, WE COULD

17:12.467 --> 17:13.000
SNAP THOSE SANCTIONS BACK.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.033
IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL.

17:16.033 --> 17:17.000
AND YET MANY FELT IT WAS TOO

17:17.000 --> 17:17.900
GENEROUS TO IRAN.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.600
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU CALLED IT

17:19.600 --> 17:21.700
"A BAD MISTAKE OF HISTORIC

17:21.700 --> 17:24.033
PROPORTIONS," AND HERE IN THE

17:24.033 --> 17:25.934
U.S., THERE WAS HARD OPPOSITION

17:25.934 --> 17:26.367
WITH ADS LIKE THIS.

17:26.367 --> 17:27.333
>> DAD!

17:27.333 --> 17:28.133
>> HEY, HEY, BUD!

17:28.133 --> 17:28.900
HOW ARE YOU?

17:28.900 --> 17:29.567
>> GOOD.

17:29.567 --> 17:30.500
>> HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

17:30.500 --> 17:31.200
>> GOOD.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.100
>> HEY, SWEETHEART.

17:32.100 --> 17:32.934
>> HEY.

17:32.934 --> 17:33.900
>> I'M STARVING.

17:33.900 --> 17:34.734
>> YEAH, IT SMELLS DELICIOUS.

17:34.734 --> 17:35.934
THANK YOU, THIS LOOKS AWESOME.

17:35.934 --> 17:36.934
SO HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

17:36.934 --> 17:38.000
>> IT WAS --

17:49.667 --> 17:52.066
>> John: WOW.

17:52.066 --> 17:53.000
THAT IS A HOSTILE WAY

17:53.000 --> 17:53.667
TO MAKE YOUR POINT.

17:53.667 --> 17:54.367
THERE'S ONLY ONE AD THAT YOU

17:54.367 --> 17:55.400
COULD COMPLETELY JUSTIFY BEING

17:55.400 --> 17:57.867
INTERRUPTED BY A NUCLEAR

17:57.867 --> 17:59.433
EXPLOSION, AND IT IS THIS ONE.

17:59.433 --> 18:01.400
>> ♪ 1-877-KARS-4-KIDS,

18:01.400 --> 18:02.967
K-A-R-S ♪ --

18:05.166 --> 18:06.533
>> John: GOOD.

18:06.533 --> 18:07.667
GOOD.

18:07.667 --> 18:09.033
I'M GLAD THOSE CHILDREN ARE

18:09.033 --> 18:15.800
DEAD.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.800
BUT --

18:17.800 --> 18:18.800
BUT FOR ALL THE TALK OVER HERE

18:18.800 --> 18:19.834
ABOUT IRAN GETTING EVERYTHING

18:19.834 --> 18:21.033
THEY WANTED, YOU SHOULD KNOW

18:21.033 --> 18:25.066
THAT IRANIAN HARD-LINERS WERE

18:25.066 --> 18:27.100
FURIOUS, ARGUING THAT THEY'D

18:27.100 --> 18:27.967
GIVEN UP WAY TOO MUCH.

18:27.967 --> 18:28.633
IRAN'S LEAD NEGOTIATOR WAS

18:28.633 --> 18:31.300
THIS GUY, JAVAD ZARIF, AND SOME

18:31.300 --> 18:32.000
CHILLING CELL PHONE FOOTAGE

18:32.000 --> 18:32.667
EMERGED OF HIM BEING CONFRONTED

18:32.667 --> 18:33.633
BY A MEMBER OF THE IRANIAN

18:33.633 --> 18:34.233
PARLIAMENT.

18:34.233 --> 18:35.700
JUST LISTEN TO WHAT WAS SAID TO

18:35.700 --> 18:36.667
HIM.

18:36.734 --> 18:52.467
>> John: OUCH.

18:52.467 --> 18:53.333
"IF ISIS COMES TO OUR COUNTRY,

18:53.333 --> 18:55.934
YOU WILL BE THE FIRST TO TAKE

18:55.934 --> 18:57.467
THE BLOW."

18:57.467 --> 18:58.233
THAT IS BOTH SCARY AND,

18:58.233 --> 18:58.967
HONESTLY, NOT CONSISTENT WITH

18:58.967 --> 18:59.900
HOW ISIS OPERATES.

18:59.900 --> 19:00.667
THEY GENERALLY DON'T COME TO A

19:00.667 --> 19:02.100
COUNTRY AND SAY, "OKAY, NOBODY

19:02.100 --> 19:02.834
DIES UNTIL WE FIND THAT FIRST

19:02.834 --> 19:03.900
GUY.

19:03.900 --> 19:06.100
NOBODY KILLS ANYONE UNTIL THAT

19:06.100 --> 19:07.367
FIRST GUY TAKES THE FIRST BLOW.

19:07.367 --> 19:11.033
WE DO THIS IN ORDER, OR WE DON'T

19:11.033 --> 19:13.500
DO IT AT ALL.

19:13.500 --> 19:17.100
WE'RE ISIS.

19:17.100 --> 19:18.633
LET'S NOT COME OFF LIKE CRAZY

19:18.633 --> 19:20.100
PEOPLE."

19:20.100 --> 19:21.000
BUT DESPITE ALL THAT OPPOSITION,

19:21.000 --> 19:21.633
ON BOTH SIDES, THE DEAL WAS

19:21.633 --> 19:22.567
SIGNED.

19:22.567 --> 19:23.467
WHICH WAS A HUGE ACHIEVEMENT --

19:23.467 --> 19:24.900
OR, AS DONALD TRUMP WOULD PUT

19:24.900 --> 19:28.734
IT, A DISASTER.

19:28.734 --> 19:31.333
>> I'VE STUDIED THIS ISSUE IN

19:31.333 --> 19:32.533
GREAT DETAIL.

19:32.533 --> 19:35.166
I WOULD SAY, ACTUALLY, GREATER

19:35.166 --> 19:37.533
BY FAR THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

19:37.533 --> 19:37.967
BELIEVE ME.

19:37.967 --> 19:41.333
OH, BELIEVE ME.

19:41.333 --> 19:51.567
AND IT'S A BAD DEAL.

19:51.567 --> 19:54.800
>> John: OKAY, LET'S BE

19:54.800 --> 19:55.800
ABSOLUTELY CLEAR HERE.

19:55.800 --> 19:56.433
DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER STUDIED

19:56.433 --> 19:57.066
ANYTHING IN GREAT DETAIL.

19:57.066 --> 19:57.867
IF YOU ASKED HIM WHAT COLOR HIS

19:57.867 --> 19:58.600
WIFE'S EYES ARE, HE'D SAY

19:58.600 --> 19:59.433
"34D BUT FIRM."

19:59.433 --> 20:00.133
SO WHAT, SPECIFICALLY, DOES

20:00.133 --> 20:00.900
TRUMP THINK IS WRONG WITH THIS

20:00.900 --> 20:01.667
DEAL?

20:01.667 --> 20:02.400
WELL, HE HAS A NUMBER OF

20:02.400 --> 20:03.400
COMPLAINTS.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.033
AND THE FIRST HAS TO DO WITH

20:04.033 --> 20:04.734
MONITORING THEIR NUCLEAR

20:04.734 --> 20:05.700
FACILITIES.

20:05.700 --> 20:06.433
>> IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW,

20:06.433 --> 20:07.400
SURVEILLANCE, THEY HAVE THE

20:07.400 --> 20:08.233
RIGHT TO SELF-INSPECT, HOW ABOUT

20:08.233 --> 20:08.934
THAT?

20:08.934 --> 20:10.033
ON THEIR MAJOR, THE MOST

20:10.033 --> 20:10.467
DANGEROUS, THEY CAN

20:10.467 --> 20:13.133
SELF-INSPECT.

20:13.133 --> 20:14.700
>> John: OKAY, SO THAT'S JUST

20:14.700 --> 20:15.467
NOT TRUE.

20:15.467 --> 20:16.266
THEY CAN'T SELF-INSPECT.

20:16.266 --> 20:17.133
THE DEAL ALLOWS FOR REGULAR

20:17.133 --> 20:17.934
MONITORING OF ALL DECLARED

20:17.934 --> 20:19.233
NUCLEAR SITES, ONE OF WHICH EVEN

20:19.233 --> 20:20.266
HAS 24-HOUR VIDEO SURVEILLANCE,

20:20.266 --> 20:21.667
AND IT'S DONE BY THE

20:21.667 --> 20:22.867
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY

20:22.867 --> 20:23.934
AGENCY, THE U.N.'S NUCLEAR

20:23.934 --> 20:26.600
WATCHDOG, WHICH HAS ALREADY

20:26.600 --> 20:27.700
CONFIRMED TEN SUCCESSIVE TIMES

20:27.700 --> 20:29.266
THAT IRAN IS COMPLYING WITH THE

20:29.266 --> 20:31.500
DEAL.

20:31.500 --> 20:37.600
AND FUN FACT: IF IRAN COMPLIES

20:37.600 --> 20:39.867
JUST ONCE MORE, THEY WIN A FREE

20:39.867 --> 20:40.533
MEAL AT PIZZA HAT.

20:40.533 --> 20:42.233
JUST AN EXTRA LITTLE INCENTIVE

20:42.233 --> 20:42.934
TO STAY IN LINE.

20:42.934 --> 20:43.667
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING

20:43.667 --> 20:44.600
TRUMP GETS WRONG ABOUT THE

20:44.600 --> 20:45.934
DEAL'S INSPECTION PROCESS.

20:45.934 --> 20:46.767
>> HOW ABOUT THIS?

20:46.767 --> 20:48.033
WE SEE SOMETHING WRONG OR WE

20:48.033 --> 20:49.567
THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG,

20:49.567 --> 20:51.200
SO WE HAVE TO WAIT 24 DAYS

20:51.200 --> 20:54.200
BEFORE WE GO IN.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.133
BUT BEFORE THE 24 DAYS START,

20:55.133 --> 20:56.367
THERE'S A WHOLE PROCEDURE, SO

20:56.367 --> 20:58.100
WHO KNOWS HOW LONG IT COULD BE.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.667
IT COULD BE SIX MONTHS.

20:59.667 --> 21:05.433
>> John: OKAY, WHAT HE'S TALKING

21:05.433 --> 21:06.300
ABOUT THERE IS THE FACT THAT,

21:06.300 --> 21:07.000
WHILE, AGAIN, WE HAVE IMMEDIATE,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.433
CONSTANT ACCESS TO THEIR

21:08.433 --> 21:09.166
DECLARED SITES, WE ALSO HAVE

21:09.166 --> 21:09.967
ACCESS TO ANY OTHER SITE,

21:09.967 --> 21:13.133
MILITARY OR CIVILIAN, WHERE WE

21:13.133 --> 21:14.000
SUSPECT UNDECLARED NUCLEAR

21:14.000 --> 21:14.834
DEVELOPMENT.

21:14.834 --> 21:16.066
NOW, IRAN CAN PUSH BACK ON THOSE

21:16.066 --> 21:20.133
SUSPICIONS, BUT ONCE THE IAEA

21:20.133 --> 21:21.200
DEMANDS ACCESS, IRAN HAS JUST

21:21.200 --> 21:26.166
24 DAYS, MAX, TO LET US IN.

21:26.166 --> 21:28.667
AND IT IS A PRETTY TALL ORDER TO

21:28.667 --> 21:32.233
CLEAN UP ANY TRACE OF AN ISOTOPE

21:32.233 --> 21:34.066
WITH A HALF-LIFE OF

21:34.066 --> 21:37.533
710 MILLION YEARS

21:37.533 --> 21:38.667
IN JUST 24 DAYS.

21:38.667 --> 21:39.967
THINK ABOUT IT.

21:39.967 --> 21:40.734
IT'S NOT EVEN LONG ENOUGH TO

21:40.734 --> 21:41.567
ADEQUATELY CLEAN YOUR APARTMENT

21:41.567 --> 21:42.233
AFTER YOU RENT IT OUT ON AIRBNB.

21:42.233 --> 21:43.533
"HOW IS THERE JIZZ INSIDE MY

21:43.533 --> 21:47.700
PIANO?

21:47.700 --> 21:49.900
WHAT MONSTER WOULD DO THIS?

21:49.900 --> 21:51.100
THIS ISN'T AN ACCIDENT.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.433
IT MUST BE WHY THEY WANTED A

21:52.433 --> 21:54.533
PIANO."

21:54.533 --> 21:55.266
BUT ONE OF TRUMP'S OTHER

21:55.266 --> 21:56.066
COMPLAINTS IS THAT SOME PARTS OF

21:56.066 --> 21:56.834
THIS DEAL EXPIRE IN 10 OR 15

21:56.834 --> 21:57.734
YEARS, AND AS HE SEES IT, THAT

21:57.734 --> 21:59.133
LEADS TO AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM.

21:59.133 --> 22:00.300
>> THE BIGGER PROBLEM IS THAT

22:00.300 --> 22:01.233
THEY CAN KEEP THE TERMS AND

22:01.233 --> 22:02.166
STILL GET THE BOMB BY SIMPLY

22:02.166 --> 22:07.500
RUNNING OUT THE CLOCK.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.133
>> John: AGAIN, THAT IS SIMPLY

22:08.133 --> 22:09.000
NOT TRUE.

22:09.000 --> 22:09.967
THEY CAN'T KEEP THE TERMS AND

22:09.967 --> 22:10.700
GET THE BOMB.

22:10.700 --> 22:12.233
THE TERMS EXPRESSLY FORBID THEM

22:12.233 --> 22:13.367
FROM DOING THAT.

22:13.367 --> 22:14.300
WHAT IRAN COULD DO, IN THEORY,

22:14.300 --> 22:16.100
IS WAIT FOR PARTS OF THE DEAL TO

22:16.100 --> 22:17.467
EXPIRE IN TEN YEARS.

22:17.467 --> 22:18.433
THEN IT COULD RAMP UP ITS

22:18.433 --> 22:19.567
NUCLEAR PROGRAM, GETTING IT

22:19.567 --> 22:20.734
CLOSER TO A BOMB.

22:20.734 --> 22:22.033
BUT HERE'S THE THING, IF THE

22:22.033 --> 22:23.867
DEAL BLOWS UP, IRAN COULD START

22:23.867 --> 22:24.934
DOING THAT RIGHT NOW, IN ZERO

22:24.934 --> 22:27.266
YEARS.

22:27.266 --> 22:31.333
AND ZERO IS LESS THAN TEN.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.867
TRUST US, WE RAN THE NUMBERS

22:32.867 --> 22:34.066
ON THIS OURSELVES.

22:34.066 --> 22:34.967
I SPENT A WEEK AT CAMBRIDGE

22:34.967 --> 22:36.400
SPEAKING WITH THE LUCASIAN CHAIR

22:36.400 --> 22:38.367
OF MATHEMATICS, MICHAEL CATES,

22:38.367 --> 22:39.200
AND I FEEL VIRTUALLY CERTAIN:

22:39.200 --> 22:43.367
ZERO IS LESS THAN TEN.

22:43.367 --> 22:45.100
ALSO, YOU SHOULD KNOW,

22:45.100 --> 22:46.000
BEFORE THE DEAL, IRAN HAD

22:46.000 --> 22:46.800
ENOUGH ENRICHED URANIUM TO

22:46.800 --> 22:47.734
EVENTUALLY CREATE EIGHT TO TEN

22:47.734 --> 22:48.500
BOMBS, WHICH, REMEMBER, THEY

22:48.500 --> 22:52.533
GAVE UP, MEANING THEY CURRENTLY

22:52.533 --> 22:53.467
HAVE ENOUGH FOR ZERO BOMBS,

22:53.467 --> 22:54.600
WHICH, AGAIN, IS LESS THAN TEN.

22:54.600 --> 22:55.467
I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THE

22:55.467 --> 22:56.433
EXTENT TO WHICH ZERO IS LESS

22:56.433 --> 22:59.767
THAN TEN.

22:59.767 --> 23:01.166
IT JUST IS.

23:01.166 --> 23:02.533
WE HAVE TO AGREE ON THAT, OR WE

23:02.533 --> 23:07.000
ARE ALL FUCKED.

23:07.000 --> 23:07.767
AND LOOK, IT'S IMPORTANT TO

23:07.767 --> 23:08.533
REMEMBER, THIS DEAL ISN'T JUST

23:08.533 --> 23:09.367
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND IRAN.

23:09.367 --> 23:10.233
THERE ARE MULTIPLE COUNTRIES

23:10.233 --> 23:11.233
INVOLVED, NONE OF WHOM ARE

23:11.233 --> 23:12.467
ANXIOUS TO CHANGE ITS TERMS.

23:12.467 --> 23:14.133
EVEN BRITAIN'S BORIS JOHNSON --

23:14.133 --> 23:14.767
A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE WHAT WOULD

23:14.767 --> 23:16.066
HAPPEN IF DRACO MALFOY GOT AN

23:16.066 --> 23:21.500
MBA AND DEVELOPED A DRINKING

23:21.500 --> 23:22.633
PROBLEM -- EVEN HE THINKS A

23:22.633 --> 23:23.700
RENEGOTIATION IS A NON-STARTER.

23:23.700 --> 23:24.500
>> I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS

23:24.500 --> 23:26.233
COME UP WITH A BETTER IDEA.

23:26.233 --> 23:28.533
I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON THOSE

23:28.533 --> 23:29.800
WHO OPPOSE THE JCPOA REALLY TO

23:29.800 --> 23:31.066
COME UP WITH THAT BETTER

23:31.066 --> 23:33.000
SOLUTION.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.333
>> John: EXACTLY.

23:34.333 --> 23:35.834
YOU CAN'T JUST BE AGAINST

23:35.834 --> 23:37.133
SOMETHING WITHOUT HAVING ANY

23:37.133 --> 23:39.867
PLAN FOR WHAT COMES NEXT.

23:39.867 --> 23:40.667
TRUMP IS LIKE A CAT ON AN

23:40.667 --> 23:42.166
AIRPLANE TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM

23:42.166 --> 23:46.033
ITS CARRIER.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.767
OKAY, BUT IF YOU GET OUT,

23:47.767 --> 23:48.500
THEN WHAT?

23:48.500 --> 23:49.333
DO YOU HAVE A CAT-SIZED

23:49.333 --> 23:51.967
PARACHUTE IN THERE WITH YOU?

23:51.967 --> 23:52.900
WHAT IS YOUR FUCKING PLAN HERE?

23:52.900 --> 23:53.867
AND OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT GOING TO

23:53.867 --> 23:54.800
SAY "CAT-SIZED PARACHUTE"

23:54.800 --> 23:55.800
WITHOUT SHOWING YOU A CAT IN A

23:55.800 --> 23:59.500
PARACHUTE.

23:59.500 --> 24:00.867
THAT IS JUST A GIVEN.

24:00.867 --> 24:03.700
I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.

24:03.700 --> 24:05.367
AND, LOOK, WHILE TRUMP HAS

24:05.367 --> 24:07.300
ARTICULATED BROADLY WHAT HE

24:07.300 --> 24:08.834
WANTS, SOME OF HIS DEMANDS ARE

24:08.834 --> 24:09.800
COMPLETE NON-STARTERS.

24:09.800 --> 24:10.867
HE WANTS A COMPLETE BAN ON

24:10.867 --> 24:11.667
BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTING,

24:11.667 --> 24:13.000
UNCONSTRAINED ACCESS TO ANY

24:13.000 --> 24:14.667
MILITARY SITE, AND NO EXPIRATION

24:14.667 --> 24:15.400
OF ANY CLAUSE IN THE AGREEMENT

24:15.400 --> 24:16.700
EVER.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.000
AND IF THOSE ARE DEALBREAKERS

24:18.000 --> 24:18.800
FOR HIM, THIS DEAL IS BROKEN.

24:18.800 --> 24:19.567
AND WHILE YOU'D HOPE SOMEONE

24:19.567 --> 24:20.633
WOULD TALK HIM 'ROUND, TRUMP HAS

24:20.633 --> 24:21.500
SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH

24:21.500 --> 24:22.633
IRAN HAWKS.

24:22.633 --> 24:24.033
HIS NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF

24:24.033 --> 24:25.367
STATE IS MIKE POMPEO, WHO'S

24:25.367 --> 24:27.800
REPORTEDLY SAID OF IRAN,

24:27.800 --> 24:28.667
"WE KNOW THEY'RE CHEATING, WE'RE

24:28.667 --> 24:30.600
JUST NOT SEEING IT," WHICH IS A

24:30.600 --> 24:31.900
HELL OF A STATEMENT FROM A GUY

24:31.900 --> 24:38.967
WHO GIVES RIM JOBS TO GORILLAS.

24:38.967 --> 24:40.734
AND SURE, SURE, NO ONE'S EVER

24:40.734 --> 24:45.900
SEEN MIKE POMPEO GIVING A RIM

24:45.900 --> 24:47.734
JOB TO A GORILLA, BUT THAT'S HOW

24:47.734 --> 24:48.400
WE KNOW HE DOES IT.

24:48.400 --> 24:54.867
AND EVEN MORE WORRISOME IS

24:54.867 --> 24:55.734
JOHN BOLTON, HIS NEW NATIONAL

24:55.734 --> 24:56.266
SECURITY ADVISER.

24:56.266 --> 24:56.934
BOLTON IS A FAR-RIGHT

24:56.934 --> 24:57.767
CONSERVATIVE WHO DONALD TRUMP

24:57.767 --> 24:58.400
HAD ORIGINALLY CONSIDERED FOR

24:58.400 --> 24:59.166
THE JOB IN 2016 BUT REPORTEDLY

24:59.166 --> 24:59.867
HESITATED BECAUSE OF HIS

24:59.867 --> 25:06.100
WALRUS-STYLE MUSTACHE.

25:06.100 --> 25:10.767
AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, I AGREE

25:10.767 --> 25:11.367
WITH TRUMP ON THAT ONE.

25:11.367 --> 25:12.100
THAT MUSTACHE IS A PROBLEM.

25:12.100 --> 25:12.934
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S POSSESSED BY

25:12.934 --> 25:13.600
THE GHOST OF BORAT.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.433
THE POINT IS, BOLTON HAS LONG

25:14.433 --> 25:15.066
BEEN A CRITIC OF THE IRAN DEAL.

25:15.066 --> 25:16.000
>> I THINK THE DEAL IS

25:16.000 --> 25:16.834
INHERENTLY FLAWED.

25:16.834 --> 25:17.867
I THINK IT'S A STRATEGIC DEBACLE

25:17.867 --> 25:19.433
FOR THE UNITED STATES.

25:19.433 --> 25:21.200
YOU CAN ALWAYS TINKER AROUND THE

25:21.200 --> 25:22.500
EDGES, AND THE QUESTION IS

25:22.500 --> 25:23.500
WHETHER PUTTING LIPSTICK ON A

25:23.500 --> 25:24.667
PIG IS REALLY GONNA MAKE A

25:24.667 --> 25:30.233
DIFFERENCE HERE.

25:30.233 --> 25:31.100
>> John: COME ON.

25:31.100 --> 25:32.033
THIS DEAL IS PREVENTING IRAN

25:32.033 --> 25:32.633
FROM GETTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

25:32.633 --> 25:33.934
IT'S NOT A PIG WITH LIPSTICK.

25:33.934 --> 25:34.734
BESIDES, PIGS DON'T NEED

25:34.734 --> 25:36.533
LIPSTICK TO LOOK BEAUTIFUL, YOU

25:36.533 --> 25:37.734
SUPERFICIAL ASSHOLE.

25:37.734 --> 25:39.533
PIGS ARE BEAUTIFUL JUST THE WAY

25:39.533 --> 25:42.100
THEY ARE, AND THEY DON'T NEED TO

25:42.100 --> 25:43.900
CONFORM TO YOUR UNREALISTIC

25:43.900 --> 25:46.166
STANDARDS OF FARM ANIMAL BEAUTY.

25:46.166 --> 25:54.767
#SwineIsSexy, #Feminism.

25:54.767 --> 25:56.567
AND, LOOK, BOLTON HAS GONE MUCH

25:56.567 --> 25:57.166
FURTHER THAN THAT.

25:57.166 --> 25:58.000
REMEMBER THAT AD WITH THE

25:58.000 --> 25:58.500
EXPLODING FAMILY?

25:58.500 --> 25:59.200
HIS GROUP MADE THAT AD.

25:59.200 --> 25:59.834
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING,

25:59.834 --> 26:01.300
"WELL, WHAT'S HIS ALTERNATIVE TO

26:01.300 --> 26:01.533
A DEAL?

26:01.533 --> 26:02.200
IT CAN'T BE WAR WITH IRAN,

26:02.200 --> 26:03.100
CAN IT?"

26:03.100 --> 26:04.000
WELL, JUST WATCH THIS SPEECH HE

26:04.000 --> 26:04.934
GAVE TO A GROUP OF IRANIAN

26:04.934 --> 26:08.066
DISSIDENTS IN PARIS LAST YEAR.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.800
>> THE DECLARED POLICY OF THE

26:09.800 --> 26:12.800
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SHOULD

26:12.800 --> 26:14.600
BE THE OVERTHROW OF THE MULLAH'S

26:14.600 --> 26:20.500
REGIME IN TEHRAN.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.400
THE BEHAVIOR AND THE OBJECTIVES

26:23.400 --> 26:25.500
OF THE REGIME ARE NOT GOING TO

26:25.500 --> 26:27.433
CHANGE, AND THEREFORE THE ONLY

26:27.433 --> 26:30.033
SOLUTION IS TO CHANGE THE REGIME

26:30.033 --> 26:34.667
ITSELF.

26:34.667 --> 26:38.400
AND THAT'S -- AND THAT'S WHY,

26:38.400 --> 26:41.867
BEFORE 2019, WE HERE WILL

26:41.867 --> 26:43.200
CELEBRATE IN TEHRAN.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.600
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

26:44.600 --> 26:48.700
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

26:48.700 --> 26:51.500
TO MY EARS,

26:51.500 --> 26:52.633
THAT IS THE INCOMING NATIONAL

26:52.633 --> 26:53.333
SECURITY ADVISER SEEMING TO CALL

26:53.333 --> 26:54.567
FOR THE INVASION OF IRAN BEFORE

26:54.567 --> 26:58.367
THE END OF THE YEAR.

26:58.367 --> 27:00.000
IT'S SO HORRIFIC, YOUR BRAIN CAN

27:00.000 --> 27:00.700
BARELY ABSORB IT.

27:00.700 --> 27:01.567
IT'S LIKE THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA

27:01.567 --> 27:02.233
ANNOUNCING SHE'S GOING TO MURDER

27:02.233 --> 27:03.266
AND COOK HER HUSBAND, JEFFREY,

27:03.266 --> 27:06.900
BEFORE 2019.

27:06.900 --> 27:09.467
AT THAT POINT, SHE IS BEEN SO

27:09.467 --> 27:10.767
OBVIOUS,

27:10.767 --> 27:12.734
IF NO ONE ACTIVELY STOPS HER,

27:12.734 --> 27:13.800
IT'S PARTLY ON US.

27:13.800 --> 27:14.667
SO UNLESS CONGRESS OR OUR

27:14.667 --> 27:15.433
EUROPEAN ALLIES FIGURE OUT

27:15.433 --> 27:16.266
SOMETHING THEY CAN SELL TO TRUMP

27:16.266 --> 27:17.000
AS A FIX, IT SEEMS TRUMP IS

27:17.000 --> 27:17.934
GOING TO REIMPOSE SANCTIONS ON

27:17.934 --> 27:18.800
MAY 12.

27:18.800 --> 27:19.934
AND IF HE DOES THAT, THIS DEAL

27:19.934 --> 27:20.667
COULD COLLAPSE.

27:20.667 --> 27:21.600
AND THE DAMAGE OF THAT WOULD BE

27:21.600 --> 27:22.600
LONG-TERM AND POTENTIALLY

27:22.600 --> 27:24.100
IRREVERSIBLE.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.100
SET ASIDE THE FACT THAT YOU

27:25.100 --> 27:26.734
WOULD ALIENATE A WHOLE

27:26.734 --> 27:27.734
GENERATION OF YOUNGER IRANIANS

27:27.734 --> 27:28.500
WHO SUPPORT THIS DEAL.

27:28.500 --> 27:29.600
JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS WOULD

27:29.600 --> 27:30.900
DO TO AMERICA'S CREDIBILITY.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.567
WHY WOULD NORTH KOREA CONSIDER

27:32.567 --> 27:34.233
SIGNING A NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH

27:34.233 --> 27:35.767
US IF WE JUST BROKE THE

27:35.767 --> 27:37.000
AGREEMENT WE SIGNED ONLY THREE

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
YEARS AGO WITH IRAN?

27:39.000 --> 27:40.300
AND IF THIS DEAL DIES AND IRAN

27:40.300 --> 27:41.700
RESUMES ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS

27:41.700 --> 27:43.033
PROGRAM, IT COULD THEN START A

27:43.033 --> 27:44.533
NUCLEAR ARMS RACE IN THE

27:44.533 --> 27:46.000
MIDDLE EAST.

27:46.000 --> 27:49.266
AND THE PROBLEM HERE IS, I CAN'T

27:49.266 --> 27:50.367
OFFER YOU MUCH HOPE.

27:50.367 --> 27:51.400
THERE IS NOT REALLY A

27:51.400 --> 27:52.667
"WRITE YOUR CONGRESSMAN"

27:52.667 --> 27:54.500
SOLUTION TO THIS.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.467
WE COULD BE IN SERIOUS TROUBLE

27:56.467 --> 27:57.633
BECAUSE TWO OF TRUMP'S TOP

27:57.633 --> 27:59.066
ADVISERS ARE, LIKE HIM, DEAD-SET

27:59.066 --> 28:00.467
AGAINST THIS DEAL.

28:00.467 --> 28:01.867
AND THEY'RE GETTING BACKUP FROM

28:01.867 --> 28:04.266
SEAN HANNITY, WHOSE SHOW THE

28:04.266 --> 28:05.133
PRESIDENT WATCHES SO MUCH

28:05.133 --> 28:06.367
ADVISERS REFER TO HIM AS THE

28:06.367 --> 28:08.033
SHADOW CHIEF OF STAFF.

28:08.033 --> 28:11.266
HANNITY HATES THIS DEAL TOO.

28:11.266 --> 28:14.333
SO THERE'S NOT REALLY A WAY FOR

28:14.333 --> 28:16.400
US TO GET A MODERATING VOICE

28:16.400 --> 28:17.700
INTO THIS CONVERSATION SHORT OF

28:17.700 --> 28:18.900
BUYING TIME ON HANNITY'S SHOW

28:18.900 --> 28:20.100
THIS WEEK AND RUNNING AN AD LIKE

28:20.100 --> 28:24.033
THIS.

28:24.033 --> 28:24.633
>> DAD!

28:24.633 --> 28:25.800
>> HEY, BUD, HOW ARE YOU?

28:25.800 --> 28:27.700
>> HEY.

28:27.700 --> 28:32.400
>> HEY, DAD, HOW ARE YOU?

28:32.400 --> 28:34.000
>> DINNER IS READY.

28:34.000 --> 28:34.867
>> I'M STARVING.

28:34.867 --> 28:36.000
>> SMELLS DELICIOUS.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.400
>> HEY THERE, DONALD.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.066
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOUR

28:38.066 --> 28:39.133
SUPPER.

28:39.133 --> 28:40.600
I'M A COWBOY.

28:40.600 --> 28:41.667
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, THE IRAN

28:41.667 --> 28:43.100
DEAL MAY NOT BE PERFECT, BUT IT

28:43.100 --> 28:44.433
HELPS RESTRICT IRAN'S ABILITY TO

28:44.433 --> 28:45.767
START MAKING A BOMB FOR AT LEAST

28:45.767 --> 28:47.500
TEN YEARS.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.934
YOU BLOW UP THE DEAL, AND THAT

28:48.934 --> 28:50.900
TURNS INTO ZERO YEARS.

28:50.900 --> 28:53.867
AND IF I'VE LEARNED ONE THING

28:53.867 --> 28:55.266
FROM ALL THESE YEARS OF

28:55.266 --> 28:56.266
COWBOYING AND CALFING, IT'S THAT

28:56.266 --> 28:59.100
ZERO IS WAY LESS THAN TEN.

28:59.100 --> 29:01.200
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.367
>> ALSO, YOU REALLY WANT TO

29:03.367 --> 29:04.333
LISTEN TO A GUY WITH A MUSTACHE

29:04.333 --> 29:06.100
LIKE THIS?

29:06.100 --> 29:07.967
DON'T DO IT, DONALD.

29:07.967 --> 29:13.533
DON'T DO IT.

29:14.433 --> 29:15.400
HEY, DOES ANYONE SMELL GAS?

29:15.400 --> 29:16.667
>> OH, MY GOD, THE STOVE.

29:20.600 --> 29:23.200
>> John: THAT AD IS SCHEDULED TO

29:23.200 --> 29:28.200
RUN DURING "HANNITY" IN THE

29:28.200 --> 29:29.567
D.C. AREA ON FOX NEWS THIS WEEK,

29:29.567 --> 29:30.266
WHERE IT WILL PRESUMABLY CONFUSE

29:30.266 --> 29:30.800
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.867
AND I'M NOT SAYING IT'S GOING TO

29:31.867 --> 29:32.633
CHANGE ANYTHING, BUT AT LEAST

29:32.633 --> 29:33.633
WE'LL KNOW WE TRIED.

29:33.633 --> 29:34.433
THAT IS OUR SHOW.

29:34.433 --> 29:36.266
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

29:36.266 --> 29:37.400
