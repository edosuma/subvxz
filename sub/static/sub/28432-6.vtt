00:09.483 --> 00:11.042
Cersei's
followers will abandon her

00:11.066 --> 00:12.358
if they know the war is lost.

00:12.567 --> 00:13.775
Give them that chance.

00:14.983 --> 00:16.149
If the city surrenders,

00:16.233 --> 00:17.993
they will ring the bells
and raise the gates.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.941
I'll find you later.

04:57.650 --> 04:58.692
It's not safe.

05:02.149 --> 05:03.858
Let me send some men with you.

05:07.858 --> 05:09.191
I'm going alone.

05:55.066 --> 05:57.108
In the name
of the one true queen,

05:57.191 --> 05:58.483
Daenerys Targaryen,

05:59.608 --> 06:01.275
I sentence you to die.

06:02.275 --> 06:03.608
Grey Worm!

06:10.650 --> 06:12.358
It's over.

06:12.441 --> 06:13.817
These men are prisoners.

06:13.899 --> 06:16.525
It is not over until the queen's
enemies are defeated.

06:16.608 --> 06:18.775
How much more defeated
do you want them to be?

06:18.858 --> 06:20.941
- They're on their knees.
- They are breathing.

06:22.108 --> 06:24.066
Look around you, friend. We won.

06:24.149 --> 06:26.483
I obey my queen's commands,
not yours.

06:26.567 --> 06:28.858
And what are
the queen's commands?

06:30.149 --> 06:33.316
"Kill all who follow
Cersei Lannister."

06:34.233 --> 06:35.608
These are free men.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.650
They chose to fight for her.

06:41.316 --> 06:43.817
Easy, men. Easy! Easy.

06:53.775 --> 06:54.775
Jon.

06:57.441 --> 06:59.650
We should speak with the queen.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.149
Hyah!

15:30.817 --> 15:31.899
Torgo Nudho.

18:13.817 --> 18:15.650
You freed your brother.

18:17.066 --> 18:18.817
You committed treason.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.650
I freed my brother.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.899
And you slaughtered a city.

20:21.941 --> 20:23.941
What are you doing here?

20:26.650 --> 20:29.525
Hey, what happened?

20:29.608 --> 20:31.358
I came to kill Cersei.

20:32.775 --> 20:34.483
Your queen got there first.

20:38.983 --> 20:41.024
She's everyone's queen now.

20:41.108 --> 20:43.650
Try telling Sansa.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.149
Wait for me
outside the city gates.

20:52.233 --> 20:53.983
- I'll come find you.
- Jon.

20:56.149 --> 20:57.525
She knows who you are.

20:58.817 --> 21:00.149
Who you really are.

21:00.233 --> 21:02.650
You'll always
be a threat to her.

21:05.191 --> 21:07.733
And I know a killer
when I see one.

21:40.149 --> 21:41.899
Did you bring any wine?

21:43.149 --> 21:44.191
No.

21:45.817 --> 21:47.316
Ah...

21:47.400 --> 21:48.400
Well...

21:50.316 --> 21:52.525
thank you for coming
to see me.

21:53.817 --> 21:56.858
Our queen doesn't keep prisoners
for long.

21:58.358 --> 22:01.441
I suppose there's
a crude kind of justice.

22:03.233 --> 22:07.108
I betrayed my closest friend
and watched him burn.

22:07.191 --> 22:10.316
Now Varys's ashes
can tell my ashes:

22:10.400 --> 22:12.899
"See, I told you."

22:17.567 --> 22:19.525
It just occurred to me.

22:19.608 --> 22:21.233
I'm talking
to the only man alive

22:21.316 --> 22:23.275
who knows where I'm going.

22:24.775 --> 22:27.066
So is there life after death?

22:30.400 --> 22:31.899
Not that I've seen.

22:33.149 --> 22:35.441
I should be thankful.

22:35.525 --> 22:38.400
Oblivion is the best
I could hope for.

22:39.733 --> 22:41.817
I strangled my lover.

22:41.899 --> 22:44.149
I shot my own father
with a crossbow.

22:44.233 --> 22:45.358
I betrayed my queen.

22:45.441 --> 22:46.941
- You didn't.
- I did.

22:48.775 --> 22:49.817
And I'd do it again,

22:49.899 --> 22:52.108
now that I've seen
what I've seen.

22:53.441 --> 22:55.441
I chose my fate.

22:55.525 --> 22:58.316
The people
of King's Landing did not.

23:00.608 --> 23:02.817
I can't justify what happened.

23:04.525 --> 23:05.608
I won't try.

23:08.899 --> 23:11.692
- But the war is over now.
- Is it?

23:14.024 --> 23:16.983
When you heard her
talking to her soldiers,

23:17.066 --> 23:20.191
did she sound like someone
who's done fighting?

23:28.483 --> 23:31.316
She liberated the people
of Slaver's Bay.

23:31.400 --> 23:34.525
She liberated the people
of King's Landing.

23:34.608 --> 23:36.400
And she'll go on liberating

23:36.483 --> 23:39.567
until the people of the world
are free...

23:39.650 --> 23:40.983
and she rules them all.

23:41.066 --> 23:44.400
And you've been by her side,
counseling her.

23:44.483 --> 23:45.858
Until today.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.650
Until today.

23:52.316 --> 23:54.233
Varys was right.

23:54.316 --> 23:56.191
I was wrong.

23:56.275 --> 23:59.108
It was vanity
to think I could guide her.

23:59.191 --> 24:01.441
Our queen's nature
is fire and blood.

24:01.525 --> 24:04.108
You think our house words
are stamped on our bodies

24:04.191 --> 24:06.275
when we're born
and that's who we are?

24:06.358 --> 24:08.692
Then I'd be fire and blood too.

24:10.275 --> 24:11.400
She's not her father,

24:11.483 --> 24:13.024
no more than
you're Tywin Lannister.

24:13.108 --> 24:18.441
My father was an evil man.
My sister was an evil woman.

24:18.525 --> 24:19.817
Pile up all the bodies

24:19.899 --> 24:21.899
of all the people
they ever killed,

24:21.983 --> 24:23.441
there still won't be
half as many

24:23.525 --> 24:26.275
as our beautiful queen
slaughtered in a single day.

24:26.358 --> 24:27.608
Cersei left her no choice.

24:27.692 --> 24:29.066
The moment the gates fell,

24:29.149 --> 24:30.191
the battle was over.

24:30.275 --> 24:32.275
She saw her friend beheaded.

24:32.358 --> 24:34.191
She saw her dragon
shot out of the sky.

24:34.275 --> 24:36.108
And she burned down
a city for it.

24:36.191 --> 24:38.692
Ah, it's easy to judge
when you're standing

24:38.775 --> 24:39.941
far from the battlefield.

24:40.024 --> 24:41.692
Would you have done it?

24:43.275 --> 24:44.525
What?

24:46.024 --> 24:48.692
You've been up there,
on a dragon's back.

24:48.775 --> 24:50.066
You've had that power.

24:50.149 --> 24:51.983
Would you have burned
the city down?

24:55.899 --> 24:57.983
I don't know.

24:58.066 --> 24:59.483
Yes, you do.

25:01.525 --> 25:04.567
You won't say because
you don't want to betray her...

25:06.441 --> 25:07.775
but you know.

25:16.108 --> 25:18.316
What's it matter what I'd do?

25:18.400 --> 25:21.567
It matters more than anything.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.608
When she murdered
the slavers of Astapor,

25:29.941 --> 25:32.191
I'm sure no one
but the slavers complained.

25:32.275 --> 25:34.149
After all, they were evil men.

25:35.858 --> 25:39.692
When she crucified hundreds
of Meereenese nobles,

25:39.775 --> 25:40.775
who could argue?

25:40.817 --> 25:42.316
They were evil men.

25:43.567 --> 25:47.149
The Dothraki khals
she burned alive?

25:47.233 --> 25:49.817
They would have
done worse to her.

25:51.275 --> 25:55.483
Everywhere she goes,
evil men die

25:55.567 --> 25:57.692
and we cheer her for it.

25:59.066 --> 26:00.400
And she grows more powerful

26:00.483 --> 26:04.024
and more sure
that she is good and right.

26:09.441 --> 26:10.733
She believes her destiny

26:10.817 --> 26:14.108
is to build a better world
for everyone.

26:14.191 --> 26:15.650
If you believed that...

26:17.275 --> 26:18.483
if you truly believed it,

26:18.567 --> 26:19.733
wouldn't you kill

26:19.817 --> 26:22.567
whoever stood between
you and paradise?

26:54.024 --> 26:56.191
I know you love her.

27:01.441 --> 27:03.358
I love her too.

27:07.024 --> 27:10.692
Not as successfully as you.

27:13.358 --> 27:17.858
But I believed in her
with all my heart.

27:25.608 --> 27:29.024
Love is more powerful
than reason.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.775
We all know that.

27:33.858 --> 27:35.567
Look at my brother.

27:40.650 --> 27:42.941
"Love is the death of duty."

27:48.650 --> 27:50.733
You just came up with that?

27:56.149 --> 27:59.567
Maester Aemon said it
a long time ago.

28:04.650 --> 28:09.149
Sometimes
duty is the death of love.

28:14.567 --> 28:18.692
You are the shield
that guards the realms of men.

28:18.775 --> 28:21.191
And you've always tried
to do the right thing.

28:21.275 --> 28:22.941
No matter the cost,

28:23.941 --> 28:26.275
you've tried to protect people.

28:28.441 --> 28:31.608
Who is the greatest threat
to the people now?

28:39.149 --> 28:41.775
It's a terrible thing
I'm asking.

28:43.149 --> 28:45.191
It's also the right thing.

28:47.483 --> 28:50.941
Do you think I'm the last man
she'll execute?

28:52.941 --> 28:54.191
Who is more dangerous

28:54.275 --> 28:57.650
than the rightful heir
to the Iron Throne?

29:10.650 --> 29:13.483
That's her decision.
She is the queen.

29:22.233 --> 29:24.191
I'm sorry it came to this.

29:36.066 --> 29:37.858
And your sisters?

29:39.858 --> 29:42.733
Do you see them
bending the knee?

29:46.358 --> 29:48.108
My sisters will be loyal
to the throne.

29:48.191 --> 29:51.941
Why do you think Sansa
told me the truth about you?

29:52.024 --> 29:54.108
Because she doesn't want Dany
to be queen.

29:54.191 --> 29:57.108
- She doesn't get to choose.
- No.

29:57.191 --> 29:58.525
But you do.

30:00.149 --> 30:02.024
And you have to choose now.

34:02.316 --> 34:04.858
When I was a girl,
my brother told me it was made

34:04.941 --> 34:08.440
with 1000 swords
from Aegon's fallen enemies.

34:11.315 --> 34:13.149
What do 1000 swords look like

34:13.233 --> 34:15.983
in the mind of a little girl
who can't count to 20?

34:17.400 --> 34:21.233
I imagined a mountain of swords
too high to climb.

34:21.315 --> 34:22.733
So many fallen enemies,

34:22.817 --> 34:25.024
you could only see
the soles of Aegon's feet.

34:25.108 --> 34:26.275
I saw them executing

34:26.358 --> 34:28.275
Lannister prisoners
in the street.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.899
They said they were acting
on your orders.

34:31.983 --> 34:35.190
- It was necessary.
- Necessary?

34:35.275 --> 34:37.065
Have you been down there?

34:37.149 --> 34:38.400
Have you seen?

34:38.483 --> 34:41.233
Children,
little children, burned!

34:44.024 --> 34:46.650
I tried to make peace
with Cersei.

34:47.983 --> 34:51.525
She used their innocence
as a weapon against me.

34:51.608 --> 34:53.400
She thought
it would cripple me.

34:53.483 --> 34:55.149
And Tyrion?

34:58.483 --> 35:02.108
He conspired behind my back
with my enemies.

35:02.191 --> 35:05.024
How have you treated people
who've done the same to you,

35:05.108 --> 35:07.650
even when it broke your heart?

35:10.149 --> 35:11.692
Forgive him.

35:14.024 --> 35:15.733
- I can't.
- You can.

35:17.358 --> 35:18.650
You can forgive all of them,

35:18.733 --> 35:21.441
make them see
they made a mistake.

35:21.525 --> 35:23.358
Make them understand.

35:28.024 --> 35:30.024
Please, Dany.

35:33.233 --> 35:35.858
We can't hide behind
small mercies.

35:37.191 --> 35:39.233
The world we need

35:39.316 --> 35:42.066
won't be built by men
loyal to the world we have.

35:42.149 --> 35:46.149
The world we need is a world
of mercy. It has to be.

35:46.233 --> 35:47.775
And it will be.

35:50.608 --> 35:55.567
It's not easy to see something
that's never been before.

35:58.108 --> 35:59.899
A good world.

36:00.899 --> 36:02.567
How do you know?

36:04.441 --> 36:06.650
How do you know it'll be good?

36:06.733 --> 36:08.483
Because I know what is good.

36:09.858 --> 36:11.066
And so do you.

36:11.149 --> 36:13.483
- I don't.
- You do.

36:13.567 --> 36:16.233
You do. You've always known.

36:19.066 --> 36:20.899
What about everyone else?

36:22.733 --> 36:26.066
All the other people
who think they know what's good.

36:28.233 --> 36:30.400
They don't get to choose.

36:36.191 --> 36:37.358
Be with me.

36:38.941 --> 36:41.066
Build the new world with me.

36:41.149 --> 36:43.525
This is our reason.

36:43.608 --> 36:45.108
It has been
from the beginning,

36:45.191 --> 36:48.358
since you were a little boy
with a bastard's name

36:48.441 --> 36:51.941
and I was a little girl
who couldn't count to 20.

36:52.775 --> 36:54.608
We do it together.

36:56.733 --> 36:59.858
We break the wheel together.

37:02.775 --> 37:04.441
You are my queen.

37:05.817 --> 37:08.692
Now, and always.

44:30.941 --> 44:32.400
Where's Jon?

44:32.483 --> 44:35.567
- He is our prisoner.
- So is Lord Tyrion.

44:35.650 --> 44:37.899
They were both to be brought
to this gathering.

44:37.983 --> 44:40.692
We will decide what we do
with our prisoners.

44:40.775 --> 44:42.149
This is our city now.

44:42.233 --> 44:44.650
If you look outside the walls
of your city,

44:44.733 --> 44:46.316
you'll find thousands
of Northmen

44:46.400 --> 44:49.024
who will explain to you
why harming Jon Snow

44:49.108 --> 44:50.775
is not in your interest.

44:50.858 --> 44:52.817
And you will find
thousands of Unsullied

44:52.899 --> 44:54.066
who believe that it is.

44:54.149 --> 44:56.858
Some of you may be
quick to forgive.

44:56.941 --> 44:59.024
The Ironborn are not.

44:59.108 --> 45:01.024
I swore to follow
Daenerys Targaryen.

45:01.108 --> 45:02.858
You swore to follow a tyrant.

45:02.941 --> 45:04.733
She freed us from a tyrant.

45:04.817 --> 45:06.275
Cersei is gone because of her,

45:06.358 --> 45:08.692
and Jon Snow put a knife
in her heart.

45:08.775 --> 45:11.024
Let the Unsullied give him
what he deserves.

45:11.108 --> 45:13.066
Say another word
about killing my brother

45:13.149 --> 45:14.441
and I'll cut your throat.

45:14.525 --> 45:15.941
Friends, please.

45:17.941 --> 45:21.149
We've been cutting each other's
throats long enough.

45:21.233 --> 45:24.024
Torgo Nudho.
Am I saying that properly?

45:27.567 --> 45:29.191
If it weren't for you
and your men,

45:29.275 --> 45:31.692
we would've lost the war
with the dead.

45:31.775 --> 45:34.358
This country owes you
a debt it can never repay,

45:34.441 --> 45:36.066
but let us try.

45:36.149 --> 45:38.191
There is land in the Reach.

45:38.275 --> 45:39.525
Good land.

45:39.608 --> 45:42.149
The people that used to live
there are gone.

45:42.233 --> 45:44.233
Make it your own.
Start your own house

45:44.316 --> 45:46.775
with the Unsullied
as your bannermen.

45:46.858 --> 45:48.733
We've had enough war.

45:48.817 --> 45:51.066
Thousands of you,
thousands of them.

45:51.149 --> 45:53.066
You know how it ends.

45:53.149 --> 45:54.858
We need to find a better way.

45:54.941 --> 45:57.400
We do not need payment.

45:57.483 --> 45:58.983
We need justice.

46:00.191 --> 46:01.983
Jon Snow cannot go free.

46:05.233 --> 46:06.899
It's not for you to decide.

46:06.983 --> 46:08.483
You are not here to speak!

46:09.733 --> 46:12.066
Everyone has heard enough words
from you.

46:14.149 --> 46:15.983
You're right.

46:16.066 --> 46:18.692
And no one's any better for it.

46:20.024 --> 46:22.191
But it's not for you to decide.

46:23.858 --> 46:26.108
Jon committed his crime here.

46:26.191 --> 46:29.692
His fate
is for our king to decide.

46:29.775 --> 46:31.066
Or our queen.

46:31.149 --> 46:33.358
We don't have a king or queen.

46:34.692 --> 46:37.692
You're the most powerful people
in Westeros.

46:40.066 --> 46:41.692
Choose one.

46:51.316 --> 46:52.858
Make your choice, then.

47:15.567 --> 47:17.149
My lords and ladies...

47:20.567 --> 47:25.149
I suppose this is the most
important moment of our lives.

47:25.233 --> 47:27.483
What we decide today
will reverberate

47:27.567 --> 47:29.275
through the annals of history.

47:29.358 --> 47:31.316
I stand before you

47:31.400 --> 47:34.400
as one of the senior lords
in the country.

47:35.275 --> 47:37.066
A veteran of two wars.

47:38.233 --> 47:39.775
And I like to think
my experience

47:39.858 --> 47:43.692
has led to some small skill
in statecraft

47:43.775 --> 47:45.191
- and underst...
- Uncle?

47:48.108 --> 47:49.108
Please sit.

48:21.066 --> 48:23.483
Well, we have to choose someone.

48:23.567 --> 48:24.817
Um, ahem...

48:24.899 --> 48:26.692
Why just us?

48:30.817 --> 48:31.983
Um...

48:33.733 --> 48:36.066
We represent
all the great houses,

48:36.149 --> 48:37.441
but whomever we choose,

48:37.525 --> 48:40.817
they won't just rule over
lords and ladies.

48:40.899 --> 48:44.233
Maybe the decision about
what's best for everyone

48:44.316 --> 48:45.483
should be left to...

48:46.650 --> 48:49.358
well, everyone.

49:02.858 --> 49:05.775
Maybe we should give the dogs
a vote as well.

49:05.858 --> 49:07.358
I'll ask my horse.

49:16.525 --> 49:19.108
I suppose you want the crown.

49:19.191 --> 49:20.608
Me?

49:21.191 --> 49:22.692
The Imp?

49:24.316 --> 49:26.692
Half the people hate me
for serving Daenerys,

49:26.775 --> 49:28.899
the other half hate me
for betraying her.

49:30.858 --> 49:34.358
- Can't think of a worse choice.
- Who, then?

49:40.858 --> 49:45.066
I've had nothing to do but think
these past few weeks.

49:46.775 --> 49:49.149
About our bloody history.

49:50.567 --> 49:52.775
About the mistakes we've made.

50:03.733 --> 50:06.066
What unites people?

50:08.441 --> 50:09.899
Armies?

50:11.441 --> 50:12.817
Gold?

50:15.108 --> 50:16.899
Flags?

50:23.608 --> 50:25.233
Stories.

50:27.108 --> 50:29.316
There's nothing in the world
more powerful

50:29.400 --> 50:30.608
than a good story.

50:32.941 --> 50:34.608
Nothing can stop it.

50:35.941 --> 50:37.817
No enemy can defeat it.

50:39.567 --> 50:41.191
And who has a better story...

50:42.483 --> 50:44.149
than Bran the Broken?

50:48.024 --> 50:51.275
The boy who fell
from a high tower and lived.

50:52.775 --> 50:56.858
He knew he'd never walk again,
so he learned to fly.

50:58.024 --> 51:00.441
He crossed beyond the Wall,

51:00.525 --> 51:02.024
a crippled boy,

51:02.108 --> 51:04.817
and became the Three-Eyed Raven.

51:07.191 --> 51:09.191
He is our memory,

51:09.275 --> 51:11.941
the keeper of all our stories.

51:12.024 --> 51:16.483
The wars, weddings, births,
massacres, famines.

51:16.567 --> 51:18.483
Our triumphs,

51:18.567 --> 51:21.108
mm, our defeats,

51:21.191 --> 51:22.316
our past.

51:24.191 --> 51:26.983
Who better to lead us
into the future?

51:29.983 --> 51:33.775
Bran has no interest in ruling
and he can't father children.

51:33.858 --> 51:35.066
Good.

51:35.149 --> 51:37.650
Sons of kings
can be cruel and stupid,

51:37.733 --> 51:39.149
as you well know.

51:40.191 --> 51:42.149
His will never torment us.

51:46.233 --> 51:49.525
That is the wheel
our queen wanted to break.

51:56.692 --> 51:59.775
From now on,
rulers will not be born.

51:59.858 --> 52:02.692
They will be chosen
on this spot

52:02.775 --> 52:05.775
by the lords and ladies
of Westeros...

52:05.858 --> 52:08.024
to serve the realm.

52:16.066 --> 52:18.066
I know you don't want it.

52:19.275 --> 52:22.858
I know you don't care
about power.

52:24.941 --> 52:28.899
But I ask you now,
if we choose you...

52:30.483 --> 52:31.941
will you wear the crown?

52:33.608 --> 52:36.692
Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms
to the best of your abilities

52:36.775 --> 52:39.567
from this day
until your last day?

52:45.233 --> 52:48.149
Why do you think
I came all this way?

52:54.733 --> 52:56.899
To Brandon of House Stark...

52:58.358 --> 52:59.567
I say aye.

53:11.191 --> 53:12.233
Aye.

53:18.941 --> 53:19.941
Aye.

53:21.233 --> 53:22.233
Aye.

53:25.275 --> 53:26.358
Aye.

53:29.233 --> 53:30.233
Aye.

53:34.817 --> 53:36.525
Aye.

53:36.608 --> 53:38.191
Aye.

53:38.275 --> 53:39.525
Aye.

53:39.608 --> 53:41.650
- Aye.
- Aye.

53:41.733 --> 53:42.733
Aye.

53:44.608 --> 53:47.275
I'm not sure I get a vote,
but aye.

53:49.400 --> 53:50.400
Aye.

54:01.525 --> 54:03.817
I love you, little brother.
I always will.

54:03.899 --> 54:05.650
You'll be a good king.

54:06.899 --> 54:09.191
But tens of thousands
of Northmen

54:09.275 --> 54:12.066
fell in the Great War
defending all of Westeros.

54:12.149 --> 54:14.149
And those who survived
have seen too much

54:14.233 --> 54:17.149
and fought too hard
ever to kneel again.

54:19.858 --> 54:23.358
The North will remain
an independent kingdom,

54:23.441 --> 54:25.483
as it was
for thousands of years.

54:50.608 --> 54:53.441
All hail Bran the Broken,

54:53.525 --> 54:54.650
First of His Name,

54:54.733 --> 54:57.941
King of the Andals
and the First Men,

54:58.024 --> 55:02.733
Lord of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

55:05.525 --> 55:08.525
All hail Bran the Broken!

55:20.358 --> 55:22.149
Lord Tyrion...

55:23.567 --> 55:25.358
you will be my Hand.

55:25.441 --> 55:27.149
N...

55:27.233 --> 55:30.483
No, Your Grace,
I don't want it.

55:30.567 --> 55:32.650
And I don't want to be king.

55:34.733 --> 55:37.024
I don't deserve it.

55:37.108 --> 55:39.983
I thought I was wise,
but I wasn't.

55:40.066 --> 55:44.149
I thought I knew what was right,
but I didn't.

55:46.483 --> 55:47.983
Choose Ser Davos.

55:48.066 --> 55:49.441
Choose anyone else.

55:49.525 --> 55:51.817
- I choose you.
- You cannot.

55:51.899 --> 55:53.650
Yes, I can.

55:53.733 --> 55:56.149
- I'm king.
- This man is a criminal.

55:56.233 --> 55:59.525
- He deserves justice.
- He just got it.

55:59.608 --> 56:02.066
He's made many
terrible mistakes.

56:02.149 --> 56:05.608
He's going to spend the rest
of his life fixing them.

56:10.358 --> 56:12.024
It is not enough.

56:20.066 --> 56:22.858
Giving you to the Unsullied
would start a war.

56:24.275 --> 56:26.441
Letting you walk free
would start a war.

56:27.608 --> 56:29.024
So our new king has chosen

56:29.108 --> 56:30.858
to send you
to the Night's Watch.

56:32.941 --> 56:34.525
There's still a Night's Watch?

56:36.775 --> 56:38.358
The world will always
need a home

56:38.441 --> 56:39.858
for bastards and broken men.

56:44.941 --> 56:47.066
You shall take no wife,

56:47.149 --> 56:49.233
hold no lands,

56:49.316 --> 56:50.858
father no children.

56:53.983 --> 56:56.817
The Unsullied wanted your head
of course,

56:56.899 --> 57:00.233
but Grey Worm has accepted
the justice of a life sentence.

57:01.899 --> 57:05.066
Sansa and Arya wanted you freed,

57:05.149 --> 57:09.149
but they understand our new king
needs to make peace.

57:09.233 --> 57:10.692
No one is very happy.

57:11.858 --> 57:13.733
Which means
it's a good compromise,

57:13.817 --> 57:14.817
I suppose.

57:16.692 --> 57:18.400
Was it right?

57:21.483 --> 57:22.983
What I did?

57:25.858 --> 57:27.608
What we did.

57:31.275 --> 57:33.233
It doesn't feel right.

57:39.858 --> 57:42.358
Ask me again in 10 years.

58:04.858 --> 58:08.316
I don't expect
we'll ever see each other again.

58:12.316 --> 58:13.733
I wouldn't be so sure.

58:14.983 --> 58:16.483
A few years as Hand of the King

58:16.567 --> 58:19.567
would make anyone want to
piss off the edge of the world.

01:00:38.358 --> 01:00:41.024
I wish there had been
another way.

01:00:42.525 --> 01:00:44.024
Can you forgive me?

01:00:56.275 --> 01:00:58.775
The North is free,
thanks to you.

01:01:00.817 --> 01:01:02.941
But they lost their king.

01:01:04.233 --> 01:01:07.066
Ned Stark's daughter
will speak for them.

01:01:09.149 --> 01:01:11.567
She's the best
they could ask for.

01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:34.567
You can come see me, you know,
at Castle Black.

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:37.358
I can't.

01:01:37.441 --> 01:01:41.024
You think anyone will dare
tell you women aren't allowed?

01:01:46.733 --> 01:01:48.191
I'm not going back north.

01:01:50.233 --> 01:01:51.692
Where are you going?

01:01:53.775 --> 01:01:55.941
What's west of Westeros?

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.899
I don't know.

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:01.275
No one knows.

01:02:02.483 --> 01:02:04.692
It's where all the maps stop.

01:02:06.775 --> 01:02:08.483
That's where I'm going.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.650
You have your Needle?

01:02:19.983 --> 01:02:20.983
Right here.

01:02:43.066 --> 01:02:44.733
Your Grace.

01:02:53.608 --> 01:02:56.316
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you needed me.

01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:01.275
You were exactly where
you were supposed to be.

01:07:14.941 --> 01:07:16.608
That's not... Uh...

01:07:22.108 --> 01:07:23.191
What's this?

01:07:23.275 --> 01:07:25.858
A Song of Ice and Fire.

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:27.858
Archmaester Ebrose's history
of the wars

01:07:27.941 --> 01:07:30.191
following the death
of King Robert.

01:07:30.275 --> 01:07:32.483
I helped him with the title.

01:07:35.233 --> 01:07:37.899
I suppose I come in
for some heavy criticism.

01:07:37.983 --> 01:07:40.358
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

01:07:40.441 --> 01:07:43.149
Oh, he's kind to me.
Never would've guessed.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.858
He's not kind?

01:07:49.858 --> 01:07:51.316
- He...
- He what?

01:07:52.441 --> 01:07:54.525
What does he say about me?

01:07:59.858 --> 01:08:03.483
I don't believe
you're mentioned, ahem.

01:08:25.066 --> 01:08:26.233
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

01:08:26.316 --> 01:08:27.524
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

01:08:46.358 --> 01:08:49.441
We appear to be missing
a Master of Whisperers.

01:08:49.524 --> 01:08:51.108
And a Master of Laws.

01:08:51.191 --> 01:08:53.524
- And a Master of War.
- Yes, Your Grace.

01:08:53.608 --> 01:08:55.567
Suitable prospects
will be brought to you

01:08:55.649 --> 01:08:57.567
for an audience
in the coming weeks.

01:08:58.858 --> 01:09:01.399
And Drogon? Any word?

01:09:01.483 --> 01:09:03.441
He was last spotted flying east,
toward...

01:09:03.524 --> 01:09:05.233
The farther away, the better.

01:09:06.983 --> 01:09:08.233
Perhaps I can find him.

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:10.899
Do carry on with the rest.

01:09:12.066 --> 01:09:13.941
As you wish, Your Grace.

01:09:16.108 --> 01:09:17.608
Ser Podrick.

01:09:26.233 --> 01:09:28.899
We serve at your pleasure,
King Bran the Broken,

01:09:28.983 --> 01:09:32.567
ruler of the Six Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm.

01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:34.733
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

01:09:34.817 --> 01:09:36.774
- Long may he reign.
- Long may he reign.

01:09:36.858 --> 01:09:38.233
Long may he reign.

01:09:39.733 --> 01:09:40.899
That will improve.

01:09:42.066 --> 01:09:43.399
I'm sure it will.

01:09:50.899 --> 01:09:53.108
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater,

01:09:53.191 --> 01:09:54.316
Lord of Highgarden,

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.024
Lord Paramount of the Reach

01:09:56.108 --> 01:09:57.525
and Master of Coin,

01:09:57.608 --> 01:10:01.191
would you say the crown's debt
to you has been paid?

01:10:01.275 --> 01:10:03.066
In full, my lord Hand.

01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:04.191
Good.

01:10:04.275 --> 01:10:06.525
Time to start incurring
a new one.

01:10:06.608 --> 01:10:07.983
We have hungry people to feed.

01:10:08.066 --> 01:10:09.858
Can we expect some assistance
in this regard?

01:10:09.941 --> 01:10:11.525
Indeed we can.

01:10:11.608 --> 01:10:15.149
Lord Davos, we have an armada
to rebuild and ports to repair.

01:10:15.233 --> 01:10:17.316
We have. These projects
will begin as soon as

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.692
the Master of Coin and Lord of
Lofty Titles provides funding.

01:10:20.775 --> 01:10:24.024
The Master of Coin looks forward
to helping the Master of Ships,

01:10:24.108 --> 01:10:26.817
but first he has to ensure
we're not wasting coin,

01:10:26.899 --> 01:10:28.733
or soon there won't be
no more coin.

01:10:28.817 --> 01:10:29.983
"Any more."

01:10:30.066 --> 01:10:31.525
You Master of Grammar now too?

01:10:31.608 --> 01:10:33.400
Grandmaester, ahem,

01:10:33.483 --> 01:10:35.692
it is my theory,
based on my years of work

01:10:35.775 --> 01:10:37.024
on the Casterly Rock sewers,

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:39.149
that clean water
leads to a healthier population.

01:10:39.233 --> 01:10:41.983
The Archmaester has done
some research on this subject

01:10:42.066 --> 01:10:43.108
and it turns out...

01:10:43.191 --> 01:10:45.441
The strong live
and the weak don't.

01:10:45.525 --> 01:10:47.441
Find the best builders
and set them to the task.

01:10:47.525 --> 01:10:51.024
Oh, speaking of builders, all
the best brothels burned down.

01:10:51.108 --> 01:10:53.858
The Master of Coin is willing
to fund reconstruction.

01:10:53.941 --> 01:10:56.899
Uh... the Archmaester
is less than enthusiastic

01:10:56.983 --> 01:10:59.233
about the salutary effects
of brothels.

01:10:59.316 --> 01:11:01.775
Well, I imagine
he isn't using them properly.

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:04.024
I think we can all agree
that ships

01:11:04.108 --> 01:11:05.650
take precedence over brothels.

01:11:05.733 --> 01:11:08.400
I think that's
a very presumptuous statement.

01:11:09.817 --> 01:11:11.358
I once brought a jackass

01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:13.692
and a honeycomb into a brothel.

01:15:33.191 --> 01:15:35.024
The Queen in the North!

01:15:35.108 --> 01:15:37.024
The Queen in the North!

01:15:37.108 --> 01:15:38.817
The Queen in the North!

01:15:38.899 --> 01:15:40.483
The Queen in the North!

01:15:40.567 --> 01:15:41.983
The Queen in the North!

01:15:42.066 --> 01:15:43.775
The Queen in the North!
