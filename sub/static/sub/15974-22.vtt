<i>First team in the studio,
please.</i>

01:48:12.391 --> 01:48:14.519
<i>Five minutes.</i>

[Telephone ringing]

01:48:19.998 --> 01:48:21.966
Well...

01:48:22.034 --> 01:48:23.502
Yes.

01:48:23.568 --> 01:48:25.002
We're in our underwear.

01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:26.629
There's no question about that.

01:48:26.705 --> 01:48:27.638
Yes.

01:48:27.706 --> 01:48:28.730
We're two grown men

01:48:28.807 --> 01:48:29.831
with important jobs

01:48:29.908 --> 01:48:30.841
who are standing

01:48:30.909 --> 01:48:31.967
in their underwear.

01:48:33.445 --> 01:48:36.415
Let's sing a song. Seriously.

01:48:36.481 --> 01:48:38.176
Yeah.

01:48:38.250 --> 01:48:40.548
[Dialing]

01:48:40.619 --> 01:48:41.916
Yeah, this is Casey McCall.

01:48:41.987 --> 01:48:43.955
We could use a little wardrobe
up here.

01:48:44.022 --> 01:48:45.956
[indistinct voices]

01:48:46.024 --> 01:48:48.322

<i>Will: Stand by, animation.</i>

01:48:49.995 --> 01:48:52.020
Give me Cleveland
and sound on 4.

01:48:52.097 --> 01:48:54.327
-- What do you think?
-- About the camera?

01:48:54.399 --> 01:48:57.164
Not just a camera --
the Soshi/Suntac RTS-lll.

01:48:57.235 --> 01:48:58.896
-- Sounds like a good camera.
-- It is.

01:48:58.970 --> 01:49:00.631
Stephon Marbury's
got four fouls.

01:49:00.706 --> 01:49:03.505
It's got center spot metering,
AP and SP exposure modes,

01:49:03.575 --> 01:49:05.566
autobracketing,
a 5 FPS motor drive --

01:49:05.644 --> 01:49:07.112
I'm gonna recut the T-wolves.

01:49:07.179 --> 01:49:09.580
-- Marbury's got four fouls.
-- TTL and spot pref lash.

01:49:09.648 --> 01:49:11.207
-- Sounds like a pretty good camera.
-- It's top of the line.

01:49:11.283 --> 01:49:12.307
-- Do you take pictures?
-- No.

01:49:12.384 --> 01:49:13.783
-- Have you ever taken pictures?
-- No.

01:49:13.852 --> 01:49:15.877
-- Do you know anything about cameras?
-- Not as such, no.

01:49:15.954 --> 01:49:17.353
But you're thinking
about buying one?

01:49:17.422 --> 01:49:20.722
I'm thinking about buying
the Soshi/Suntac RTS-lll, yes.

01:49:20.792 --> 01:49:22.419
Natalie, we need first team.

01:49:22.494 --> 01:49:23.723
We're getting there.

01:49:23.795 --> 01:49:25.388
<i>Dave." Five minutes to air.</i>

01:49:25.464 --> 01:49:27.523
-- What happened to getting a plan?
-- I know.

01:49:27.599 --> 01:49:29.761
-- There was supposed to be a plan to stop
the Dana-Gordon engagement. -- I know.

01:49:29.835 --> 01:49:31.200
-- Is there a plan?
-- No.

01:49:31.269 --> 01:49:32.361
You have no plan?

01:49:32.437 --> 01:49:35.202
-- VVell, it wasn't for lack of trying.
-- I think it was.

01:49:35.273 --> 01:49:36.502
-- I tried.
-- You didn't.

01:49:36.575 --> 01:49:37.565
I tried to come up
with a plan.

01:49:37.642 --> 01:49:39.201
-- But you didn't.
-- I didn't try?

01:49:39.277 --> 01:49:41.268
-- You didn't come up with a plan.
-- That's right.

01:49:41.346 --> 01:49:43.838
-- You have no plan.
-- That's right.

01:49:43.915 --> 01:49:45.383
[Sighs]

01:49:47.052 --> 01:49:49.214
You think there are people in
the building across the street

01:49:49.287 --> 01:49:50.982
looking at us
in our underwear?

01:49:53.325 --> 01:49:54.588
Yes, I do.

01:49:54.659 --> 01:49:56.991
Three minutes to VTR.

01:49:57.062 --> 01:49:59.292
-- Four minutes live.
-- What's the holdup?

01:49:59.364 --> 01:50:00.593
Something happened
to their pants.

01:50:00.665 --> 01:50:01.757
-- Both their pants?
-- Yeah.

01:50:01.833 --> 01:50:04.393
-- VVas there an industrial accident?
-- VVardrobe's pressing the pants.

01:50:04.469 --> 01:50:06.437
We don't have time.
Kim, get 'em in the studio.

01:50:06.505 --> 01:50:08.872
Folks, we'll get them their
pants in the first C-break.

01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:10.430
None of this
would be happening

01:50:10.509 --> 01:50:13.444
if I had the Soshi/Suntac
RTS-lll with built-in datapack.

01:50:13.512 --> 01:50:16.607
-- Do you understand anything
you're saying? -- No.

01:50:16.681 --> 01:50:19.309
-- No plan?
-- Nope.

01:50:19.384 --> 01:50:22.251
-- You know what it might be time for?
-- Sadly, I do.

01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:24.311
Yeah, it might be time
for me to step in.

01:50:24.389 --> 01:50:27.154
Let's go. We'll get you
the pants at the C-break.

01:50:27.225 --> 01:50:29.193
Okay, but I, for one,
would feel more comfortable

01:50:29.261 --> 01:50:30.660
if everyone took
their pants off.

01:50:30.729 --> 01:50:31.821
He's right.

01:50:31.897 --> 01:50:33.661
We're a team.

01:50:33.732 --> 01:50:35.325
I'll tell you...

01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:38.768
what really makes this
outfit work are the socks.

01:50:38.837 --> 01:50:40.032
I was gonna say.

01:50:40.105 --> 01:50:43.075
<i>60 seconds to VTR.
Two minutes live.</i>

01:50:43.141 --> 01:50:44.939
Glenn Rice is 6 for 6
from the arc in Portland.

01:50:45.010 --> 01:50:46.842
If they win,
we call it "Hot in 50."

01:50:46.912 --> 01:50:48.243
-- <i>Chris...
Chris: I'm on it.</i>

01:50:48.313 --> 01:50:51.283
I was thinking about
the Nishika Super 2000 LS3,

01:50:51.349 --> 01:50:54.011
but then I figured, “No, if I'm doing
this, I might as well go whole hog.“

01:50:54.085 --> 01:50:55.348
Since you don't know
what you're doing anyway.

01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:57.650
-- Exactly. -- She had a hard
time sleeping last night.

01:50:57.722 --> 01:50:59.417
-- And read a mail-order catalog.
-- Yes.

01:50:59.491 --> 01:51:01.459
For products
you know nothing about.

01:51:01.526 --> 01:51:02.789
I can tell you
that for $219.95,

01:51:02.861 --> 01:51:05.330
the Polaris digital exposure meter
is a steal at twice the price.

01:51:05.397 --> 01:51:07.866
-- Do you know what it is? -- No, but
I find myself in the market for one.

01:51:07.933 --> 01:51:09.298
<i>Dave." Roll VTR.</i>

01:51:09.367 --> 01:51:11.301
Technically, I have a plan.

01:51:11.369 --> 01:51:13.861
-- What's the plan?
-- It's Napoleon's plan.

01:51:13.939 --> 01:51:16.772
-- Who's Napoleon? -- The
19th-century French emperor.

01:51:16.842 --> 01:51:18.640
-- Cracking wise with me now?
Thanks. -- Yes.

01:51:18.710 --> 01:51:21.111
-- He had a Z-part plan.
-- What was it?

01:51:21.179 --> 01:51:24.342
First we show up,
then we see what happens.

01:51:24.416 --> 01:51:26.475
-- That was his plan?
-- Yep.

01:51:26.551 --> 01:51:28.451
-- Against the Russian army?
-- Yep.

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:31.649
-- “First we show up, then we
see what happens“? -- Yep.

01:51:31.723 --> 01:51:33.953
-- Almost hard to believe hel0sL
- Yeah.

01:51:34.025 --> 01:51:36.619
Alyson, as you can see, Casey
and I aren't wearing any pants,

01:51:36.695 --> 01:51:40.029
so I think in the interest of office
professionalism, you should avert your eyes.

01:51:40.098 --> 01:51:42.965
-- Either that or take off your pants.
-- I'll avert my eyes.

01:51:43.034 --> 01:51:44.297
Suit yourself,
but you should know

01:51:44.369 --> 01:51:45.564
I play squash
three times a week

01:51:45.637 --> 01:51:47.127
and my calves
have been called "shapely."

01:51:47.205 --> 01:51:48.695
-- Good show.
-- Good show.

01:51:48.773 --> 01:51:51.538
-- Anyway, I'm stepping in.
-- You're not stepping in.

01:51:51.610 --> 01:51:54.136
-- <i>The discussion's closed.
Dave: In 10.</i>

01:51:54.212 --> 01:51:56.909
-- Casey, who's been calling your
calves “shapely“? -- My mom.

01:51:56.982 --> 01:51:59.212
Okay. Don't talk to me
for the rest of the show.

01:51:59.284 --> 01:52:01.412
<i>In 3...2...</i>

01:52:01.486 --> 01:52:02.954
Good evening.
From New York City,

01:52:03.021 --> 01:52:05.456
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.

01:52:05.524 --> 01:52:09.984
Those stories, plus Connie Morton in
Chicago, Jack Jankowitz in Hollywood,

01:52:10.061 --> 01:52:13.224
and Kelly Kirkpatrick in Vegas
for the big weigh-in.

01:52:13.298 --> 01:52:14.891
We're right here
in midtown Manhattan,

01:52:14.966 --> 01:52:16.525
and we don't know
where you are,

01:52:16.601 --> 01:52:19.127
but we know you're watching “Sports
Night“ on CSC, so stick around.

01:52:19.204 --> 01:52:21.070
<i>Dave." We're out.</i>

01:52:21.139 --> 01:52:23.301
<i>Kim: Two minutes back.</i>

01:52:30.482 --> 01:52:32.576
In the interest
of full disclosure.

01:52:32.651 --> 01:52:33.777
Say that again.

01:52:33.852 --> 01:52:35.752
In the interest
of full disclosure.

01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:36.548
That is so lame.

01:52:36.621 --> 01:52:37.247
It's not lame.

01:52:37.322 --> 01:52:38.517
It's pretty lame.

01:52:38.590 --> 01:52:40.524
Not only isn't it lame,
I think it happens to be right.

01:52:40.592 --> 01:52:42.924
Whereas I think it's simultaneously
both wrong and lame.

01:52:42.994 --> 01:52:44.462
-- Casey...
-- It's none of my business.

01:52:44.529 --> 01:52:45.758
-- It <i>is</i> your business.
-- It's not.

01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:46.888
I disagree.

01:52:46.965 --> 01:52:48.558
I can live with that.
Elliott...

01:52:48.633 --> 01:52:50.533
Five years, $34 million
with the bonus and incentives.

01:52:50.602 --> 01:52:52.092
-- Thank you.
-- Hang on a second.

01:52:52.170 --> 01:52:53.934
We can differ.
It's okay with me...

01:52:54.005 --> 01:52:56.030
as long as you understand
that I'm right.

01:52:56.107 --> 01:52:58.701
-- You're not right. -- By
“right,“ I meant “honorable.“

01:52:58.777 --> 01:53:00.939
It's not right,
and it's not honorable.

01:53:01.012 --> 01:53:03.913
-- It's the high road. -- It's the
low road. It's the lowest of roads.

01:53:03.982 --> 01:53:07.509
Other roads which would, under normal
circumstances, be considered low roads

01:53:07.586 --> 01:53:09.315
would be high
relative to this road.

01:53:09.387 --> 01:53:10.786
She's gonna marry him, Casey.

01:53:10.855 --> 01:53:12.152
Well, that's entirely
up to her.

01:53:12.223 --> 01:53:14.055
But you have information
that she doesn't have.

01:53:14.125 --> 01:53:16.059
I graduated Phi Beta Kappa,
Danny.

01:53:16.127 --> 01:53:19.062
I have information most people don't have.
It's my cross to bear.

01:53:19.130 --> 01:53:20.620
He had an affair with Sally.

01:53:20.699 --> 01:53:22.565
-- <i>Yes.</i>
-- <i>While he was dating Dana.</i>

01:53:22.634 --> 01:53:25.660
Did Elliott say $34 million <i>with</i>
incentives or <i>plus</i> inoenflves?

01:53:25.737 --> 01:53:28.331
He slept with Sally
while he was seeing Dana,

01:53:28.406 --> 01:53:30.397
and I think that in the
interest of full disclosure,

01:53:30.475 --> 01:53:33.001
-- she should have this information.
-- No.

01:53:33.078 --> 01:53:34.739
In the interest
of full disclosure --

01:53:34.813 --> 01:53:36.747
-- Was it with or pl--
-- With incentives.

01:53:36.815 --> 01:53:39.807
-- 500 at-bats, 20 stolen bases.
-- Slugging percentage?

01:53:39.884 --> 01:53:42.080
Yes. I'm perfectly serious. Why
is it wrong to tell her, huh?

01:53:42.153 --> 01:53:43.848
It doesn't seem
very manly, does it?

01:53:43.922 --> 01:53:46.050
Do it in a deep voice.

01:53:46.124 --> 01:53:48.650
See me waving up here?
You know where I am?

01:53:48.727 --> 01:53:50.991
-- The high road? -- I can
see everything from up here.

01:53:51.062 --> 01:53:53.030
-- You have no plan?
-- <i>I have</i> a plan.

01:53:53.098 --> 01:53:55.897
-- First you show up, then you see what
happens. -- It worked for Napoleon.

01:53:55.967 --> 01:53:57.366
No, it <i>didn't</i> work
for Napoleon.

01:53:57.435 --> 01:53:58.869
Napoleon was defeated
at Waterloo

01:53:58.937 --> 01:54:00.598
and died in exile
on the island of Elba!

01:54:00.672 --> 01:54:02.834
Actually,
he was murdered on Elba.

01:54:02.907 --> 01:54:06.866
It's just one of the many things
I know that most people don't.

01:54:08.313 --> 01:54:11.510
Oh, I find myself incredibly
frustrated with you right now,

01:54:11.583 --> 01:54:13.642
and I think the best thing
for me to do

01:54:13.718 --> 01:54:15.117
is to go to the tape library

01:54:15.186 --> 01:54:17.245
and look at some film
on Atlanta's middle relief.

01:54:17.322 --> 01:54:20.087
But before I do that, I'd just
like to say that you have no plan.

01:54:20.158 --> 01:54:21.523
I can barely hear you
up here, Danny.

01:54:21.593 --> 01:54:22.924
-- I'm leaving now.
-- I'm okay with that.

01:54:22.994 --> 01:54:23.961
-- No plan.
-- Got it.

01:54:24.029 --> 01:54:25.190
Goodbye.

01:54:29.434 --> 01:54:31.368
-- Hello.
-- Hang on.

01:54:31.436 --> 01:54:34.406
-- Okay. -- What happens if I move Tampa
Bay and St. Louis to the 4-block?

01:54:34.472 --> 01:54:36.099
Does something bad happen
if I do that?

01:54:36.174 --> 01:54:38.609
There will be 55 seconds of
dead air starting at 11 :22.

01:54:38.677 --> 01:54:39.803
That's pretty bad.

01:54:39.878 --> 01:54:42.142
-'Yeah.lg0tHfisrnenn) aboutthelflood dfive.
--Yeah.Yeah.

01:54:42.213 --> 01:54:44.807
-- I can't do it. I can't give blood.
-- Okay. That's fine.

01:54:44.883 --> 01:54:46.146
Hey.

01:54:46.217 --> 01:54:48.652
-- What do you need for Phil Jackson?
-- 3:45.

01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.552
-- Can you make it 3:30?
-- Yeah. -- Dan...

01:54:50.622 --> 01:54:53.785
-- I can't give blood.
-- Okay.

01:54:53.858 --> 01:54:56.520
-- That's all I had to say. -- VVell,
you've given me a lot to think about.

01:54:56.594 --> 01:54:58.187
Yeah.

01:55:02.801 --> 01:55:04.599
-- Hi.
-- Hi.

01:55:06.504 --> 01:55:10.338
I'm gonna do something that some
people might consider wrong.

01:55:10.408 --> 01:55:13.503
-- I am not one of those people.
-- What is it?

01:55:13.578 --> 01:55:15.444
I believe what I do now
is right.

01:55:15.513 --> 01:55:18.312
I believe it in my guts,
and my guts are all I have --

01:55:18.383 --> 01:55:20.351
my guts
and a pleasing personality.

01:55:20.418 --> 01:55:22.147
-- <i>Dan...</i> -- <i>I've always
lived by my guts, Natalie.</i>

01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:23.483
Please.

01:55:23.555 --> 01:55:24.750
About two months ago,

01:55:24.823 --> 01:55:26.814
Gordon spent the night
with Sally.

01:55:26.891 --> 01:55:28.655
Who's Sally?

01:55:28.727 --> 01:55:30.354
Sally.

01:55:30.428 --> 01:55:32.260
Sally?

01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:34.196
Yes.
Now, I should tell you

01:55:34.265 --> 01:55:37.565
that Casey would prefer
Dana didn't know,

01:55:37.635 --> 01:55:39.626
so, armed with the information
I've just given you,

01:55:39.704 --> 01:55:41.365
I would ask you
to be responsible, discr--

01:55:41.439 --> 01:55:42.804
Dana!

01:55:44.809 --> 01:55:47.676
Of course,
it's entirely up to you.

01:55:47.746 --> 01:55:50.738
[indistinct voices]

01:55:53.284 --> 01:55:54.513
Let me see the Chyron.

01:55:54.586 --> 01:55:56.281
<i>Chris: They need a second.</i>

01:55:56.354 --> 01:55:58.220
It's not that I wouldn't like t0.
It's just that I can't.

01:55:58.289 --> 01:55:59.984
-- <i>Okay.</i> -- That's really
all I have to say.

01:56:00.058 --> 01:56:01.719
Check out this strobe
from B&C --

01:56:01.793 --> 01:56:04.694
3-head outlets, symmetrical and
asymmetrical power distribution,

01:56:04.763 --> 01:56:07.460
2-sync phone jack, style
outlets, built-in photocell --

01:56:07.532 --> 01:56:10.160
-- Do you know what it does? --
I don't even know what it is.

01:56:10.235 --> 01:56:12.363
-- So, you're gonna get one?
-- I think I owe it to myself.

01:56:12.437 --> 01:56:15.236
Hello. Good afternoon.
I need to talk to you.

01:56:15.306 --> 01:56:17.138
-- I haven't changed my mind.
About the blood. -- <i>About</i> what?

01:56:17.208 --> 01:56:19.006
Don't worry about it.
Please come with me.

01:56:19.077 --> 01:56:21.205
I tell you, they might as well
throw in the Dyna-lite

01:56:21.279 --> 01:56:23.907
-- with the 10-inch reflector and
the 4-way barn-door set. -- Dana!

01:56:23.982 --> 01:56:28.044
Yeah, I've really made up
my mind about this.

01:56:28.119 --> 01:56:31.487
-- You have to cancel the plans.
-- What plans?

01:56:31.556 --> 01:56:32.819
The marriage plans --
you have to cancel them.

01:56:32.891 --> 01:56:35.223
I've been engaged for two days.
I have no marriage plans.

01:56:35.293 --> 01:56:37.227
You have to call off the engagement.
You have to give back the ring.

01:56:37.295 --> 01:56:40.128
-- I don't have a ring. He's giving it to
me at lunch. -- You have to call off lunch.

01:56:40.198 --> 01:56:41.666
I am actually pretty hungry.

01:56:41.733 --> 01:56:43.360
-- Dana, seriously.
-- What?

01:56:43.434 --> 01:56:46.563
Gordon slept with Sally
a couple of months ago.

01:56:48.907 --> 01:56:50.773
Who told you that?

01:56:50.842 --> 01:56:52.776
I can't tell you.

01:56:52.844 --> 01:56:54.903
How did this person know?

01:56:54.979 --> 01:56:57.346
-- They know. I don't know.
-- How do they know?

01:56:58.583 --> 01:56:59.948
Well, I don't believe it.

01:57:00.018 --> 01:57:01.952
-- Dana, this person --
-- They got it wrong.

01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:04.455
I'll ask him about it at lunch,
but they got it wrong.

01:57:04.522 --> 01:57:06.422
You think?

01:57:06.491 --> 01:57:07.925
Yeah.

01:57:07.992 --> 01:57:10.222
-- You seem calm.
-- Yes.

01:57:10.295 --> 01:57:13.424
-- You wouldn't think you'd be this calm.
-- No, you wouldn't think so, would you?

01:57:13.498 --> 01:57:14.624
No.

01:57:14.699 --> 01:57:16.793
I'll ask him about it
at lunch.

01:57:16.868 --> 01:57:17.858
-- Yeah.
-- Dana?

01:57:17.936 --> 01:57:19.597
Yeah, I'll be right there.

01:57:22.807 --> 01:57:25.435
You really wouldn't think
I'd be this calm.

01:57:36.921 --> 01:57:38.821
[Horn honking]

01:57:38.890 --> 01:57:40.949
<i>Dana: Look at it.
Gordon: Yeah.</i>

01:57:41.025 --> 01:57:44.154
-- <i>It's like, "There it is."</i>
-- <i>Yep.</i>

01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:46.926
Look. I'm waving it around
and -- wha!

01:57:46.998 --> 01:57:49.467
There's an engagement ring.

01:57:49.534 --> 01:57:50.968
Oh, it looks great on you.

01:57:51.035 --> 01:57:53.470
-- It's the hardest substance
known to man. -- Yes.

01:57:53.538 --> 01:57:55.097
It can cut glass.

01:57:55.173 --> 01:57:57.005
Dana, what's on your mind?

01:57:57.075 --> 01:57:59.169
-- What?
-- What's on your mind?

01:57:59.244 --> 01:58:01.042
You've been strange
all through lunch.

01:58:01.112 --> 01:58:03.012
Gordon, I've been strange
my entire life.

01:58:03.081 --> 01:58:04.207
[Chuckles] Dana...

01:58:04.282 --> 01:58:06.376
Did you have an affair
with Sally Sasser?

01:58:12.190 --> 01:58:13.680
I don't believe it.

01:58:13.758 --> 01:58:15.192
-- Did you?
-- I don't believe it.

01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:17.126
-- Casey told you? -- No, as
a matter of fact, he didn't.

01:58:17.195 --> 01:58:19.721
-- Who told you? -- It
couldn't be less important.

01:58:19.797 --> 01:58:21.526
-- It <i>is</i> important. -- VVell, I
think there are other things

01:58:21.599 --> 01:58:23.192
which have become
more important.

01:58:23.268 --> 01:58:25.965
-- Dana... -- Can I tell you about
some of our dessert specials?

01:58:26.037 --> 01:58:27.835
-- No, thank you.
-- No, thanks.

01:58:27.906 --> 01:58:30.000
-- The chef has made a pecan pie.
-- Thanks anyway.

01:58:30.074 --> 01:58:32.475
One plate with two forks.

01:58:32.543 --> 01:58:33.635
Seriously, I'll kill you.

01:58:33.711 --> 01:58:35.736
Give us a second?

01:58:40.251 --> 01:58:43.221
I'm sorry.

01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:47.651
It happened
during our really bad time.

01:58:47.725 --> 01:58:50.592
I thought we were through.
I really did.

01:58:50.662 --> 01:58:53.893
Dana, my life is flashing
in front of my eyes.

01:58:53.965 --> 01:58:57.060
This is not something
to blow this over.

01:58:58.436 --> 01:59:00.666
I want to marry you.

01:59:05.843 --> 01:59:07.368
Yeah.

01:59:08.579 --> 01:59:09.910
Dana, I I--

01:59:09.981 --> 01:59:11.574
How would Casey know?

01:59:11.649 --> 01:59:14.016
-- What? -- You thought
that Casey told me.

01:59:14.085 --> 01:59:15.211
How would Casey know?

01:59:15.286 --> 01:59:17.254
It's not important.

01:59:17.322 --> 01:59:19.552
-- How would he know?
-- It...

01:59:21.459 --> 01:59:23.484
[Chuckles]

01:59:23.561 --> 01:59:26.223
[Clears throat]

01:59:26.297 --> 01:59:28.197
This part is funny,
actually.

01:59:28.266 --> 01:59:31.930
[Chuckles] About a week

01:59:32.003 --> 01:59:36.031
before I had
my liaison with Sally,

01:59:36.107 --> 01:59:38.337
Casey...spent the night
at her place

01:59:38.409 --> 01:59:39.968
and left without his shirt.

01:59:40.044 --> 01:59:42.570
It was in her closet.
I mistook it for my shirt.

01:59:42.647 --> 01:59:47.107
I was wearing it.
Casey called me on it.

01:59:50.521 --> 01:59:52.387
I see.

01:59:52.457 --> 01:59:55.552
Dana, Dana...

01:59:55.626 --> 01:59:57.526
it was nothing.

01:59:57.595 --> 02:00:00.826
It would never -- would never
happen when we were married.

02:00:00.898 --> 02:00:02.093
I believe you.

02:00:03.735 --> 02:00:06.227
-- Really?
-- Yes.

02:00:10.842 --> 02:00:13.470
See, people think it's the
needle, but it's not the needle.

02:00:13.544 --> 02:00:15.308
Look at this.
Nobody's on the perimeter.

02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:16.643
It's really not the needle.

02:00:16.714 --> 02:00:19.479
-- One, two, three people collapse
on MaoElroy. -- It's this.

02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:21.917
That blood is ostensibly going
someplace it needs to go.

02:00:21.986 --> 02:00:24.648
It's on its way to oxidize something.
I have to respect that.

02:00:24.722 --> 02:00:26.781
-- That's fine. -- All right,
it's a little bit the needle.

02:00:26.858 --> 02:00:28.223
Jeremy, can I have
the room, please?

02:00:28.292 --> 02:00:30.556
Dana, I know the blood drive is important.
I just can't do it.

02:00:30.628 --> 02:00:33.325
-- I could honestly care less.
Please close the door. -- Thank you.

02:00:35.333 --> 02:00:38.132
Did you sleep with my fiance
and then sleep with my anchor?

02:00:39.871 --> 02:00:40.963
[Sighs deeply]

02:00:41.039 --> 02:00:43.872
-- That's an awfully abrupt and
impolite question, Dana. -- Did you?

02:00:43.941 --> 02:00:47.707
I'm not prepared to stipulate that the answer
to that question is any of your business.

02:00:47.779 --> 02:00:49.941
Cut the crap, Sally.
This isn't a Noel Coward play.

02:00:50.014 --> 02:00:53.882
Nonetheless, I'm not your enemy,
and I'm not on your staff,

02:00:53.951 --> 02:00:55.942
so I'll ask you to reconsider
your tone of voice.

02:00:57.188 --> 02:00:58.713
I apologize.

02:01:00.124 --> 02:01:01.717
He told me
you'd broken up, Dana.

02:01:01.793 --> 02:01:03.852
You'd just seen us together!

02:01:03.928 --> 02:01:05.487
He said you'd broken up
that day.

02:01:05.563 --> 02:01:08.464
-- And so that night you go -- -- I think
I'll stand here while you scold me.

02:01:08.533 --> 02:01:10.695
I don't like
territorial women, Sally!

02:01:10.768 --> 02:01:13.829
VVell, I guess we won't be sharing a
ride to the prom, then, will we, Dana?

02:01:13.905 --> 02:01:15.532
At a time when this organization
was in trouble,

02:01:15.606 --> 02:01:18.940
you deliberately and maliciously
went out of your way --

02:01:19.010 --> 02:01:22.207
-- To sleep with your boyfriend
and your anchor? -- Yes!

02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:25.580
First of all, I didn't have to go very
far out of my way to do either one,

02:01:25.650 --> 02:01:27.709
and the fact that you think
that my personal life

02:01:27.785 --> 02:01:29.014
-- is an act of aggression
-- You're right.

02:01:29.087 --> 02:01:31.055
-- Is so typically you!
-- You're absolutely right.

02:01:31.122 --> 02:01:32.886
What?

02:01:32.957 --> 02:01:34.982
[Voice breaking] I'm sorry.
You're absolutely right.

02:01:35.059 --> 02:01:36.993
[Crying] I can't believe
I just came in here

02:01:37.061 --> 02:01:39.029
and said that to you.

02:01:42.133 --> 02:01:44.932
[Sighs]

02:01:46.838 --> 02:01:50.706
Oh, aren't I pathetic?

02:01:50.775 --> 02:01:52.106
No.

02:01:57.582 --> 02:02:00.711
Dana, listen to me.

02:02:00.785 --> 02:02:03.186
You're not mad
'cause I slept with Gordon.

02:02:03.254 --> 02:02:07.418
You don't care
that I slept with Gordon.

02:02:07.525 --> 02:02:09.926
You're mad
that I slept with Casey.

02:02:09.961 --> 02:02:11.793
-- No.
-- Yes.

02:02:11.863 --> 02:02:13.592
-- Why would I --
-- Dana...

02:02:13.664 --> 02:02:15.393
Look, it was --
I mean, it was one night.

02:02:15.466 --> 02:02:18.231
Well, I-it was one night
with Gordon.

02:02:18.302 --> 02:02:20.430
How many nights was it
with Casey?

02:02:20.505 --> 02:02:23.304
We've been spending the night
together for about two months.

02:02:23.374 --> 02:02:26.742
Oh, I didn't know.

02:02:26.811 --> 02:02:30.543
Just late, after work. I-l don't
get out of here till 3:00, and --

02:02:30.615 --> 02:02:31.980
Yeah, but, I mean --

02:02:32.049 --> 02:02:35.576
-- Dana... -- No, you're right.
Of course you're right.

02:02:35.653 --> 02:02:37.280
It's none of my business.

02:02:37.355 --> 02:02:38.481
Dana...

02:02:38.556 --> 02:02:40.046
I should go.

02:02:40.124 --> 02:02:44.220
Casey, um...
doesn't like me that much.

02:02:44.295 --> 02:02:46.389
What?

02:02:46.464 --> 02:02:50.423
Casey doesn't like me
that much.

02:02:50.501 --> 02:02:52.560
I'm sure you're wrong, Sally.

02:02:53.804 --> 02:02:56.000
No, I'm not.

02:02:59.710 --> 02:03:01.735
I should go.

02:03:03.247 --> 02:03:04.578
See ya.

02:03:07.852 --> 02:03:09.149
Yeah.

02:03:25.469 --> 02:03:26.766
<i>Natalie...</i>

02:03:26.837 --> 02:03:29.204
Yes, Dan?

02:03:29.273 --> 02:03:32.868
I've been thinking,
and, in retrospect,

02:03:32.944 --> 02:03:34.378
I'm not sure
it was such a good idea

02:03:34.445 --> 02:03:36.174
for me to have told you
about Gordon and Dana.

02:03:36.247 --> 02:03:38.511
Well, you've got
a problem, then, Dan.

02:03:38.583 --> 02:03:39.982
You already told Dana?

02:03:40.051 --> 02:03:43.612
Yes, I did, and Dana told Gordon,
and Gordon revealed Casey,

02:03:43.688 --> 02:03:46.714
and Sally added that it's
been going on for two months.

02:03:46.791 --> 02:03:49.021
Well, I hit the jackpot,
then, didn't I?

02:03:49.093 --> 02:03:51.790
-- Daniel, don't we have an understanding
about sharing information? -- Yes, we do.

02:03:51.862 --> 02:03:53.023
-- We have an understanding.
-- I know.

02:03:53.097 --> 02:03:55.395
22, over-the-shoulder
paintbox, sound 44.

02:03:55.466 --> 02:03:56.524
Thank you!

02:03:56.601 --> 02:03:58.296
You knew
about Gordon and Sally,

02:03:58.369 --> 02:04:00.167
and you knew
about Casey and Sally,

02:04:00.238 --> 02:04:01.933
-- and someone didn't
share, did they? -- No.

02:04:02.006 --> 02:04:03.303
When the dust settles
on this thing,

02:04:03.374 --> 02:04:04.773
you know what
you're gonna have to get?

02:04:04.875 --> 02:04:06.969

-- A little punishment.

total bases, RBIs,
runs scored, walks --

02:04:24.762 --> 02:04:27.060

I'd try <i>my</i> best.

What?

02:04:30.635 --> 02:04:32.034
Hi.

02:04:32.103 --> 02:04:33.332
Hi.

02:04:33.404 --> 02:04:35.839
So, listen...

02:04:35.906 --> 02:04:38.534
I don't quite know
how to say this,

02:04:38.609 --> 02:04:42.341
but things have changed
since the last time we spoke.

02:04:42.413 --> 02:04:44.609
What kind of things?

02:04:44.682 --> 02:04:49.347
VVell, you know how you didn't want
anyone to know about Gordon and Sally?

02:04:51.422 --> 02:04:53.186
Yeah.

02:04:53.257 --> 02:04:56.090
That's not so much
the way it is anymore.

02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:57.389
I see.

02:04:57.461 --> 02:05:01.091
And people not knowing
about you and Sally --

02:05:01.165 --> 02:05:02.394
Yeah?

02:05:02.466 --> 02:05:04.457
That's a thing of the past
as well.

02:05:04.535 --> 02:05:07.596
So here's what I think
we gotta do.

02:05:07.672 --> 02:05:10.607
I think we gotta live
in the now.

02:05:10.675 --> 02:05:13.804
I think we say, "Okay.
This has happened."

02:05:13.878 --> 02:05:15.903
I think we do those things.

02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:17.106
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

02:05:17.181 --> 02:05:18.649
I think I beat
the crap out of you.

02:05:18.716 --> 02:05:20.616
That's not what I would call
living in the now.

02:05:20.685 --> 02:05:22.380
No, it's a lot more like
beating the crap out of you.

02:05:22.453 --> 02:05:23.477
-- Yeah.
-- You told Dana?

02:05:23.554 --> 02:05:25.318
I told Natalie.
Natalie told Dana.

02:05:25.389 --> 02:05:26.823
Oh, boy!
Who would have thought?!

02:05:26.891 --> 02:05:28.882
-- Dana told Gordon. Dana told Sally.
-- Yes.

02:05:28.959 --> 02:05:30.427
Of course,
Sally already knew.

02:05:30.494 --> 02:05:31.791
-- Danny...shut up.
-- Listen --

02:05:31.862 --> 02:05:33.830

what the high road is, okay?

You're not that guy.

From time to time,
I call one on my own.

permission to have a social life?

-- Casey... -- Yeah? --
We'd like to hear 'em.

02:06:14.271 --> 02:06:16.899
I don't see why you have any
right to be upset about this.

02:06:16.974 --> 02:06:18.965
Really? Then why were
you keeping it a secret?

02:06:19.043 --> 02:06:20.568
'Cause I thought you
might be upset about this.

you might be upset.

No, you may not see the ring.

-- Okay.
-- I have to go now, Casey.

I'm going to buy a camera. -- Okay.

how to work the camera.

for not telling her sooner.

02:07:08.959 --> 02:07:10.757

our pants.

have their pants again?

Oh, I'd definitely use some. I think
you'll see a real difference.

I should be judged for this.
