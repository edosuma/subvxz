WEBVTT

00:07.299 --> 00:08.843
You've been gone
such a long time.

00:08.926 --> 00:11.220
I've found
five potential Dragons

00:11.303 --> 00:12.638
<i>in the same village.</i>

00:12.722 --> 00:14.473
- Nynaeve.
- Egwene.

00:14.515 --> 00:18.018
If it's one Dragon
or five, man or woman,

00:18.102 --> 00:20.062
<i>the heart of every prophecy</i>

00:20.146 --> 00:22.398
<i>the Dragon will either
defeat the Dark One</i>

00:22.481 --> 00:24.024
or join him.

00:29.822 --> 00:31.282
You have to be careful.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.742
<i>You have to watch him.</i>

00:32.825 --> 00:34.034
You're a right bastard,
Padan Fain.

00:34.118 --> 00:36.662
Pleasure, as always.

00:36.746 --> 00:38.789
I have made
my judgment.

00:38.873 --> 00:41.876
You are exiled from this tower.

00:41.959 --> 00:44.545
<i>The Dark One.
At the Eye of the World.</i>

00:44.587 --> 00:45.880
We can destroy him.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.214
We don't know
which one of them is the Dragon.

00:47.298 --> 00:48.841
<i>- Take them all.
- We'd be sentencing</i>

00:48.924 --> 00:50.426
the other four
to certain death.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.219
We've all heard
of the Ways in stories,

00:52.303 --> 00:53.971
but none of us know
what they are.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.098
The fastest road
to the Eye of the World.

01:01.604 --> 01:03.689
- Mat!
-

03:30.002 --> 03:31.462
Aah!

06:15.918 --> 06:17.544
- Mat! Come on!
- Mat!

06:17.628 --> 06:19.755
- Hurry up! Mat!
- Mat, no!

06:19.838 --> 06:21.173
- Mat!
- Stop!

06:21.256 --> 06:23.092
You need to open it again.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.511
We are not leaving without him.

06:25.594 --> 06:26.678
He made his choice.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.264
Did he?
Or did you make it for him?

06:29.348 --> 06:31.308
You know the darkness in him.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.060
You know it better than anyone.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.896
Do you really think he's ready
for what lies ahead?

06:36.939 --> 06:38.732
Of course he is.

06:40.526 --> 06:43.320
We've already
wasted too much time.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.906
Stay close.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.454
We need to open
the Waygate.

06:52.538 --> 06:56.250
- How? We can barely channel...
- Unfortunately,
reopening the Waygate

06:56.333 --> 06:58.043
would be impossible.

06:58.127 --> 06:59.461
There cannot be

06:59.545 --> 07:03.423
any use of the One Power
within the Ways. To do so

07:03.507 --> 07:05.592
would be to throw yourself
at Machin Shin

07:05.676 --> 07:08.512
and ask it to feast
on your soul.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.181
What is Machin Shin?

07:11.265 --> 07:14.059
Moiraine Sedai
is moving quite quickly.

07:14.143 --> 07:16.395
And we Ogier are not known

07:16.478 --> 07:19.523
for our... speed.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.150
- If you'll excuse me.
- Listen,

07:21.233 --> 07:23.110
this is Mat we're talking about.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.403
We can't just leave him.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.363
We didn't leave him.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.991
He left us.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.618
You don't actually
believe that, do you?

07:31.702 --> 07:33.996
Then what are we going to do?

07:34.079 --> 07:35.789
We can't open the Waygate.

07:35.873 --> 07:38.500
We can't find our way
out of here without them.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.044
Should we just sit down and die?

07:51.930 --> 07:56.018
When this is all over,
we'll find him.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.020
I promise you that.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.626
- What if it's him?
- Mat?

08:21.668 --> 08:25.047
There's an inherent darkness
within him.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.758
He was drawn to the dagger,
and it was feeding on him

08:27.841 --> 08:29.885
as much as he was on it.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.846
What if it's him?

08:32.930 --> 08:34.890
Then I can't let him
within a hundred leagues

08:34.973 --> 08:36.225
of the Dark One.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.727
I already know
what choice he'd make.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.687
And the one thing
that we cannot afford

08:40.771 --> 08:43.023
is for the Dragon to turn
to the Shadow.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.517
To think...

09:18.600 --> 09:22.229
that fruit trees once thrived

09:22.312 --> 09:24.439
on every island,

09:24.523 --> 09:27.442
that these
pockmarked stone paths

09:27.526 --> 09:30.737
were once soft and verdant,

09:30.821 --> 09:32.447
covered in grass,

09:32.531 --> 09:35.200
but now, one wrong step

09:35.284 --> 09:39.579
and you plummet
into a void which knows no end.

09:39.663 --> 09:41.331
- Or worse...
- There's something worse

09:41.415 --> 09:43.000
than falling
into a bottomless pit?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.210
Oh, yes, certainly.
I can think of at least...

09:45.294 --> 09:46.545
It's all right, Loial.

09:46.628 --> 09:49.298
- We understand.
- Mm-hmm.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.479
I owe Moiraine three silvers.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.569
You were scowling.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.279
I bet on pouting.

10:18.035 --> 10:20.078
Mat is safer there
than he is here.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.164
I can promise you that.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.877
Wait.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.087
There's something up there.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.854
- It's one
of the Guiding Stones.
- What?

10:52.402 --> 10:54.404
How very strange.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.783
No Ogier would deface a Guiding.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.704
It's as if someone's tried
to destroy it,

11:02.788 --> 11:04.956
keep people
from finding their way.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.667
- But can you still read it?
- Oh...

11:09.086 --> 11:11.880
I'll ask for your patience.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.924
If he's asking
for patience,

11:14.007 --> 11:16.259
- then we're gonna die.
- We'll rest here

11:16.343 --> 11:18.887
while Loial works out
the correct path.

11:18.970 --> 11:22.849
It's a day's journey, at least,
to reach our Waygate, so...

11:22.933 --> 11:25.227
take some comfort while you can.

11:26.978 --> 11:29.606
How did you see that?

11:30.649 --> 11:32.651
I don't know.

11:35.654 --> 11:38.657
Do you know what did that
to the Guiding?

11:42.577 --> 11:44.538
There's something following us.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.083
Come.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.502
Rand.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.339
Rand. Did you...

13:19.674 --> 13:21.468
What is it?

13:28.099 --> 13:29.893
-
- No!

13:34.064 --> 13:35.440
Get back!

13:37.901 --> 13:40.070
A Trolloc in the Ways.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.656
- That should be impossible.
- Explains how they reached
the Two Rivers undetected.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.074
And what happened
to the Guiding.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.700
Did it just get
a lot colder in here?

13:45.784 --> 13:48.245
- Oh, dear.
- I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to channel!

13:48.328 --> 13:50.914
- What is Machin Shin?
- It translates
from the Old Tongue

13:50.997 --> 13:52.165
to mean the Black Wind.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.000
And what exactly is
the Black Wind?

13:54.084 --> 13:56.711
Machin Shin will speak to you.
Do not listen.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.880
We'll never make it
to our Waygate.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.340
How far are we
from the Gate to Fal Dara?

14:00.423 --> 14:02.175
- It's closer, but I don't...
- Take us there.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.177
- Go!
- Quickly!

14:16.064 --> 14:17.524
This way! Come on!

14:17.607 --> 14:19.651
Quickly!

14:19.734 --> 14:21.194
- Go!
- Come on!

14:35.083 --> 14:36.710
The Waygate is up ahead.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.993
You're wrong
about everything.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.412
<i>You'll murder these children
and call it heroism.</i>

15:13.913 --> 15:17.083
<i>You're nothing,
an imposter, a fraud.</i>

15:17.167 --> 15:19.586
<i>Egwene will never love you
as much as you love her.</i>

15:19.669 --> 15:21.588
<i>She left you once,
and she'll leave you again.</i>

15:21.671 --> 15:25.050
<i>You wanted Laila dead,
out of the way.</i>

15:25.133 --> 15:26.468
<i>That's why you killed her.</i>

15:26.551 --> 15:29.012
<i>Because you loved another woman
more than your wife.</i>

15:30.513 --> 15:33.933
<i>You can't protect her.
You'll watch her die.</i>

15:34.017 --> 15:36.061
<i>You'll hear their screams
as they die,</i>

15:36.144 --> 15:37.812
<i>just like you heard
your parents,</i>

15:37.896 --> 15:39.606
<i>and you'll do nothing
to save them.</i>

15:42.359 --> 15:44.569
<i>You lost Mat,
and now you'll lose the others</i>

15:44.653 --> 15:48.490
<i>one by one, till you
have nothing and no one.</i>

15:48.573 --> 15:51.159
- No!
- <i>You can't protect them.</i>

15:51.242 --> 15:53.161
<i>You can't.</i>

16:10.261 --> 16:13.431
Please! Hurry!

16:27.237 --> 16:29.114
Quickly, now!

16:29.197 --> 16:30.907
It's open.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.619
Nynaeve!

16:57.976 --> 17:00.353
Well done. All of you.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.612
Where are we?

17:09.696 --> 17:12.365
The fortress city of Fal Dara.

17:12.449 --> 17:15.410
Last bastion against the Blight.

17:15.493 --> 17:19.247
The Eye of the World
is a day's walk beyond the city.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.540
But rest is close at hand.

17:20.623 --> 17:22.959
We have friends
in these Borderlands.

17:36.723 --> 17:40.018
Whatever it was
you heard in the wind...

17:41.019 --> 17:43.188
...put it out of your minds.

18:17.055 --> 18:21.434
How long has it been since you
last walked through this gate?

18:36.825 --> 18:38.243
Dai Shan.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.787
On behalf of Lord Agelmar,
I welcome you back

18:40.870 --> 18:42.997
to Fal Dara.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.208
Welcome home...

18:45.291 --> 18:47.418
you bloody great bastard.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.420
Your presence warms me,
Dai Shan.

19:32.755 --> 19:36.092
And you, Moiraine Sedai.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.011
To what do we owe this pleasure?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.929
I am here with a warning.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.765
- Let me guess.
- W...

19:44.225 --> 19:46.895
This anxious sister of mine

19:46.978 --> 19:49.480
wrote to the White Tower

19:49.564 --> 19:52.358
with overblown stories
of the encroaching Blight

19:52.442 --> 19:54.444
and Trolloc raids.

19:55.904 --> 19:59.574
While I appreciate your concern,
Fal Dara always has

19:59.657 --> 20:02.327
and always will be able
to protect its own.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.704
My Lord, I can assure you that
neither I nor any Aes Sedai

20:04.787 --> 20:06.706
doubts your ability
to keep the Blight at bay.

20:06.789 --> 20:08.333
I should hope not.

20:09.375 --> 20:13.212
We have guarded Tarwin's Gap
for a thousand years,

20:13.296 --> 20:14.797
and fought off armies
of Trollocs

20:14.881 --> 20:17.342
that would make
even an Aes Sedai blanch.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.470
I appreciate you making the trek
to the Borderlands,

20:20.553 --> 20:22.180
but I fear
you may have done so in vain.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.723
Lord Agelmar,
if you'll allow me to finish.

20:23.806 --> 20:27.769
I have no intention
of advising you.

20:27.852 --> 20:31.648
A Lord should protect his land
as he sees fit.

20:31.731 --> 20:34.317
I am simply here with a warning.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.404
The Dark One has begun to use
the Ways to move his armies.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.198
Now, while it behooves you
to guard the Gap,

20:40.281 --> 20:42.241
as your family has always done,
it might be prudent

20:42.325 --> 20:46.746
to have a group of men wall up
the Fal Daran Waygate as well.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.338
Do as she says.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.263
I offended you.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.766
You and your companions
are welcome here

21:06.849 --> 21:08.101
as long as you wish.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.144
The Borderlands have
a long history

21:10.228 --> 21:13.189
of mutual support
with the White Tower,

21:13.272 --> 21:16.025
and that will not change while
the Black Hawk still flies.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.445
Thank you, my Lord.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.436
Your chambers are this way.

21:51.519 --> 21:54.480
A room fit for an Aes Sedai.

21:54.564 --> 21:57.525
While I'm here, I thought
I might pay Min a visit.

21:57.608 --> 22:00.236
I presume she still resides
in the city?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.864
The Seer? Why do you wish
to speak with her?

22:02.947 --> 22:04.574
Why not?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.868
My philosophy, as well.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.579
- My brother begs to differ.
- Of course he does.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.039
Why would he ask her a question

22:11.122 --> 22:12.623
when he already knows
all the answers?

22:13.666 --> 22:15.835
We had no forewarning

22:15.918 --> 22:18.546
a sister was coming
from the towns south of here.

22:18.629 --> 22:22.800
If I were to ask
why you were in the Ways,

22:22.884 --> 22:25.678
would you give me
the courtesy of an answer?

22:27.221 --> 22:29.223
You spent many years training
with my sisters

22:29.307 --> 22:31.350
at the White Tower...

22:31.434 --> 22:33.269
and while your power
may not have been strong enough

22:33.352 --> 22:34.479
to become one of us,

22:34.562 --> 22:37.732
I hope I might still trust
your discretion.

22:39.233 --> 22:41.444
Discreet as I may be,

22:41.527 --> 22:44.072
my allegiance lies
with this city,

22:44.155 --> 22:45.865
not your Amyrlin Seat.

22:51.746 --> 22:54.207
I need a message delivered
to the Tower.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.210
There is a man
that they must find.

22:58.920 --> 23:00.797
A boy, really.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.423
Mat Cauthon.

23:02.507 --> 23:05.927
And to whom should I send
this message?

23:06.969 --> 23:09.305
The Red Ajah.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.660
What is it?

23:30.743 --> 23:32.161
Mat?

23:33.204 --> 23:35.081
It's the wind.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.791
Forget about the whispers.

23:36.874 --> 23:39.752
None of it's true.

23:39.836 --> 23:41.504
None of it.

23:52.807 --> 23:55.017
What's gotten
into you?

23:55.101 --> 23:58.479
I could've sworn I just saw
Padan Fain walk past us.

23:58.563 --> 24:00.064
The peddler?

24:01.107 --> 24:03.234
Perrin...

24:03.317 --> 24:04.902
Padan Fain is dead.

24:04.986 --> 24:08.239
He was there on Bel Tine
when the Trollocs came.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.500
Seems like a different life,
doesn't it? Bel Tine.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.849
What is
she doing here?

24:44.692 --> 24:45.818
Thank you.

24:45.902 --> 24:47.111
They don't eat
chicken or...

24:47.195 --> 24:48.321
beef?

24:48.404 --> 24:50.698
The Way of the Leaf is simple.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.325
Do no violence.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.952
If the whole world followed it,
we'd be much better off.

24:55.036 --> 24:56.454
No fish?

24:59.040 --> 25:00.875
I'll tell you what,
dinners with the Travelers

25:00.958 --> 25:02.710
were better than anything
you've ever made me.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.296
Shh.

25:05.379 --> 25:06.839
All of you.

25:06.923 --> 25:08.633
What is she up to?

25:08.716 --> 25:10.885
Any detail
would be helpful,

25:10.968 --> 25:12.970
no matter how seemingly small.

25:15.598 --> 25:18.226
It's quite invasive, this.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.144
- Do they know what I am?
- No, no one does,

25:20.228 --> 25:23.606
thanks to the Aes Sedai.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.024
I mean,
if we revealed what you were,

25:25.107 --> 25:27.485
you'd be hounded every minute
of the day.

25:27.568 --> 25:29.070
Or worse.

25:41.415 --> 25:43.751
The big brooding one
has...

25:43.834 --> 25:46.295
They're both big,
and they both brood.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.426
The one on the left...

25:52.510 --> 25:54.178
has yellow eyes,

25:54.262 --> 25:56.264
blood running down his chin.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.979
And the redhead
is rocking a baby.

26:03.062 --> 26:03.938
Whose baby?

26:04.021 --> 26:05.147
No idea.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.565
Looks like any other baby.

26:06.649 --> 26:08.776
And the girls?

26:11.320 --> 26:14.407
White flame...

26:14.490 --> 26:16.826
and a ring of gold.

26:17.868 --> 26:20.788
I don't know.

26:20.871 --> 26:23.457
But they're all linked,
all four of them.

26:23.541 --> 26:24.625
Is that unusual?

26:24.709 --> 26:26.002
Very.

26:26.085 --> 26:29.130
I see sparks of light
trying to fill the shadows,

26:29.213 --> 26:33.175
and the shadows trying
to swallow the sparks.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.387
For what it's worth,
they're all very clear visions.

26:36.470 --> 26:38.180
Usually, the more important
someone is to the Pattern,

26:38.264 --> 26:39.473
the clearer the vision.

26:40.516 --> 26:43.144
Is any vision stronger
than the others?

26:43.227 --> 26:45.438
Hmm, not particularly.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.610
You saw something for me?

26:56.699 --> 26:58.951
Don't look at me like that.

27:00.036 --> 27:01.954
I see the Amyrlin Seat,

27:02.038 --> 27:04.373
and she's wearing
full regalia, and...

27:06.709 --> 27:09.378
She's going to be your downfall.

27:19.180 --> 27:20.264
What's
taking them so long?

27:20.348 --> 27:22.099
Shh. Here she comes.

27:27.897 --> 27:30.191
We leave tomorrow at sunrise.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.194
Who was she?

27:33.277 --> 27:35.071
That bartender.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.865
A woman I've known
since she was young.

27:37.948 --> 27:38.908
Stop lying to us.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.077
You forget,
girl, that I cannot lie,

27:41.160 --> 27:44.288
no matter how much
I wish I could.

27:48.876 --> 27:53.089
She sees glimpses
of the Pattern, the future,

27:53.172 --> 27:55.424
and I hoped she'd tell me
which of you is the Dragon,

27:55.508 --> 27:56.884
so I could save the rest.

28:00.679 --> 28:04.016
I don't want you to die,
any of you,

28:04.100 --> 28:06.352
but whichever of you goes
to the Eye of the World

28:06.435 --> 28:09.105
and is not the Dragon...

28:09.188 --> 28:11.107
you will die there.

28:12.149 --> 28:15.403
Ground to dust
between two forces of nature.

28:20.574 --> 28:23.869
Well... which one of us is it?

28:23.953 --> 28:25.663
- She didn't know.
-

28:25.746 --> 28:27.123
And so tomorrow I will take

28:27.206 --> 28:28.499
all of you to the Eye,
knowing that three of you

28:28.582 --> 28:30.376
will not return.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.670
How can you be so sure?

28:32.753 --> 28:35.923
Look, isn't there a chance
that Mat's the Dragon?

28:36.006 --> 28:37.883
That we survive?

28:38.926 --> 28:40.761
That you're wrong?

28:40.845 --> 28:42.888
It's easy to use doubt
as a crutch,

28:42.972 --> 28:46.308
but doubt is the first step
toward surrender to the Dark.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.310
Look, I didn't choose
this path for myself

28:48.394 --> 28:50.354
any more than you did,

28:50.438 --> 28:53.274
but I will follow it
because I must.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.819
Because I know what is right.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.904
You've made your choice.

29:00.906 --> 29:03.200
But we'll make our own.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.872
Powerful as you are,

29:07.955 --> 29:10.124
I don't think you can drag
the four of us there

29:10.207 --> 29:11.709
against our will.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.545
Running, hiding...

29:14.628 --> 29:17.256
won't save you
from the weaving of the Pattern.

29:21.552 --> 29:23.721
Make your decisions
tonight, then.

29:23.804 --> 29:26.849
We leave at dawn.

29:33.731 --> 29:36.275
Nothing an Aes Sedai says
is optional.

29:38.027 --> 29:39.945
She'll force us if she wants to.

29:40.029 --> 29:42.656
Let her try.

29:48.496 --> 29:50.581
We left the Two Rivers

29:50.664 --> 29:53.083
to protect the people we love.

29:53.167 --> 29:55.419
Our families.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.673
And that's what
we're still doing.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.676
No matter the cost.

30:03.677 --> 30:06.514
Says Moiraine.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.682
You take everything
she says as fact.

30:08.766 --> 30:10.976
This... this entire prophecy,

30:11.060 --> 30:13.229
the Dragon Reborn being
one of us,

30:13.312 --> 30:15.231
we only believe it
because she told us it's true.

30:15.314 --> 30:16.440
She can't lie.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.067
That doesn't mean
she can't mislead.

30:19.568 --> 30:20.569
You think she just learned today

30:20.653 --> 30:22.029
that the rest of us
will die there?

30:22.112 --> 30:24.198
And even if she thinks
she's telling the truth,

30:24.281 --> 30:25.616
she could be wrong.

30:25.699 --> 30:27.576
About us, about all of it.

30:28.619 --> 30:32.998
I'm not doing this
because Moiraine said we should.

30:33.082 --> 30:36.460
Or because I'm...
I'm convinced she even knows

30:36.544 --> 30:38.379
exactly what
she's talking about.

30:38.462 --> 30:41.215
I want to go
to the Eye of the World,

30:41.298 --> 30:45.094
because if there's even a chance
she's right...

30:45.177 --> 30:46.929
then it's worth it.

30:52.059 --> 30:54.520
You're a Wisdom.

30:55.563 --> 30:58.607
If Moiraine wasn't
a part of this...

30:58.691 --> 31:00.609
you wouldn't think twice.

31:01.986 --> 31:04.405
You'd do it.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.867
Don't let your pride
stop you from doing

31:08.951 --> 31:10.411
what you know is right.

31:15.291 --> 31:17.668
We've lost
too many people already.

31:18.711 --> 31:21.213
I can't lose anyone else
in this room.

31:24.216 --> 31:28.095
What if we're throwing
our lives away for nothing?

31:28.178 --> 31:30.889
What if none of us
are the Dragon?

31:30.973 --> 31:32.975
What if it is Mat?

31:33.058 --> 31:35.144
Come on.

31:37.104 --> 31:38.606
What?

31:38.689 --> 31:40.899
Why couldn't it be him?

31:44.737 --> 31:47.489
You've never thought
much of him, have you?

31:47.573 --> 31:50.284
- Rand...
- You never gave him a chance.

31:51.827 --> 31:54.997
You never really got
to know him.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.874
If you had, then you'd know

31:56.957 --> 31:58.417
how hard he's had it,
how he fights to get by.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.085
He doesn't have much,

32:00.169 --> 32:03.130
and what he does have, he gives
to his friends, to his sisters,

32:03.213 --> 32:06.717
- to us...
- All right, stop!
- He left us, Rand.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.179
You saw his face
just the same as I did.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.889
He probably went back
to Tar Valon

32:11.972 --> 32:13.932
- for that bloody stolen dagger.
- No, you don't know anything

32:14.016 --> 32:15.726
- about that.
- He left us!

32:16.769 --> 32:18.937
Well, I guess you're the expert
on that, aren't you?

32:20.689 --> 32:23.275
What is that supposed to mean?

32:23.359 --> 32:25.527
You're the only one
who's ever really left me.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.613
Don't speak to her like that!

32:27.696 --> 32:29.448
- Stop it!
- Excuse me?

32:29.531 --> 32:32.368
- You owe her an apology.
- For what? The truth?
- Stop.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.537
Just stop. I am so tired
of you two fighting over her

32:35.621 --> 32:36.997
like she's something
you can win.

32:46.423 --> 32:49.593
I'm sorry, wh...
what did you just say?

32:59.520 --> 33:01.355
What's so funny?

33:05.234 --> 33:06.694
This.

33:06.777 --> 33:09.446
It's been right in front of me
this whole time.

33:09.530 --> 33:12.074
I never even noticed.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.371
The day you proposed to Laila,

33:17.454 --> 33:20.040
that was the day
Egwene and I got together.

33:20.124 --> 33:24.420
The only woman I've ever loved
was my wife.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.904
I didn't mean...

33:50.988 --> 33:52.239
Just...

34:19.183 --> 34:21.643
They'll come.

34:21.727 --> 34:23.479
Willingly?

34:24.938 --> 34:27.191
You've given them a semblance
of a choice.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.193
That's all they need.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.786
What is it?

34:44.958 --> 34:46.752
Nothing.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.299
Nostalgia, I suppose.

34:52.382 --> 34:55.594
The air in these Borderlands,
there's something about it.

34:55.677 --> 34:58.138
The smell, it reminds me
of the night we met.

34:58.222 --> 35:00.974
It's unlike you to dwell
on the past.

35:02.976 --> 35:05.813
I feel I've taken everything
from you.

35:05.896 --> 35:07.815
And more.

35:13.403 --> 35:15.531
You have taken nothing from me.

35:15.614 --> 35:19.827
There's more to life than me,
this mission.

35:22.454 --> 35:27.626
Before you,
I had nothing to live for...

35:27.709 --> 35:30.295
and nothing to die for.

35:30.379 --> 35:33.590
You... have given me both.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.722
Aren't there goodbyes
you need to make in this city

35:40.806 --> 35:41.974
before we go?

35:56.238 --> 35:57.948
I like her, you know.

36:01.285 --> 36:02.703
The Wisdom.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.710
-
- Come here.

36:51.793 --> 36:54.004
Oh-ho!

36:54.087 --> 36:55.631
Let me see your face.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.090
- Same?
- Ah, same.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.233
How are you? You good?

37:16.276 --> 37:18.362
- Yes, please.
- You ready?

37:20.447 --> 37:22.866
Thank you so much.

37:22.950 --> 37:24.826
Ah.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.134
Hello.

37:41.218 --> 37:44.513
- Hello. I was just...
- Following me?

37:44.596 --> 37:48.225
I don't think you could
rightly call this tracking.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.311
Hmm.

38:00.237 --> 38:02.906
Are you just going
to stand there?

38:04.950 --> 38:07.202
Or do you plan to...

38:07.285 --> 38:08.829
come in?

38:13.208 --> 38:15.335
-
- Everyone?

38:17.337 --> 38:19.589
This is Nynaeve.

38:19.673 --> 38:22.175
Nynaeve, this is everyone.

38:22.259 --> 38:24.469
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to intrude.

38:24.553 --> 38:26.513
Please, sit, sit.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.477
Are you hungry, Nynaeve Sedai?

38:32.561 --> 38:34.688
Oh, I'm no Aes Sedai.

38:34.771 --> 38:37.482
But something to eat
would be lovely, thank you.

38:37.566 --> 38:38.984
Have a seat.

38:40.235 --> 38:42.654
She is beautiful.

38:42.738 --> 38:45.032
I hadn't noticed.

38:45.115 --> 38:47.409
Here, child,
let Nynaeve sit down.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.786
Please sit.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.750
- Lan, sit with me.
- Thank you.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.044
- This smells delicious.
- Did you ever fight
the Trollocs?

38:59.796 --> 39:03.508
Thank you for keeping
my Dai Shin safe...

39:03.592 --> 39:06.303
and bringing him home to me.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.513
How big was the Trolloc?

39:08.597 --> 39:11.058
- The Trolloc was massive.
- Bigger than you?

39:11.141 --> 39:12.851
Much bigger.

39:12.934 --> 39:16.063
With big teeth and fangs.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.901
She is very sweet.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.652
She's enthusiastic.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.655
And she likes you a lot.

39:25.739 --> 39:29.034
It's because
I always bring gifts.

39:29.117 --> 39:31.161
- Always.
-

39:36.875 --> 39:39.044
Well...

39:46.843 --> 39:50.055
Thank you
for including me tonight.

39:51.098 --> 39:53.183
You didn't give me
much of a choice.

40:12.702 --> 40:14.788
Good night.

41:35.118 --> 41:37.662
Do you want me to go?

42:44.229 --> 42:46.147
I waited
in my room for an hour

42:46.231 --> 42:47.732
for you to come and apologize.

42:49.776 --> 42:52.028
I've found
through hard-won experience

42:52.112 --> 42:56.658
that when you're actually ready
to talk, you find me.

43:03.790 --> 43:05.750
I-I'm sorry.

43:08.295 --> 43:11.673
I know there's nothing
between you and Perrin.

43:11.756 --> 43:14.509
Of course there isn't.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.220
That's not why I'm angry
with you.

43:18.763 --> 43:20.890
How dare you think,
for even a second,

43:20.974 --> 43:23.643
that I don't care about Mat.

43:23.727 --> 43:26.938
That I wouldn't fight for him,
die for him.

43:27.981 --> 43:30.984
I was... scared.

43:32.736 --> 43:35.572
I still am.

43:37.449 --> 43:40.160
I don't want to lose you.

43:45.165 --> 43:47.167
And you won't.

43:48.752 --> 43:51.004
Moiraine's wrong
about one thing.

43:52.047 --> 43:54.257
We're coming back.

43:54.341 --> 43:56.092
All of us.

43:56.176 --> 43:58.803
Listen to me.

43:58.887 --> 44:02.932
Whatever happens... at the Eye,

44:03.016 --> 44:05.643
this power that lives inside
of you, you can't ignore it,

44:05.727 --> 44:08.396
'cause it won't let you.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.523
You need to go
to the White Tower,

44:10.607 --> 44:13.026
become what
you've always wanted to be.

44:14.652 --> 44:16.863
No, not without you.

44:18.073 --> 44:20.867
I've already made
that mistake once.

44:26.122 --> 44:29.501
I'll come with you
to the White Tower.

44:31.461 --> 44:35.423
Every Aes Sedai needs a Warder.

44:35.507 --> 44:38.134
Would you really think
I'd let someone else be yours?

44:54.401 --> 44:57.153
If it's you...

44:57.237 --> 45:00.907
I will always stand by you,
you know that.

45:03.284 --> 45:07.122
No matter what happens.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.207
No matter what comes.

45:40.530 --> 45:42.532
You're leaving?

45:55.587 --> 45:58.131
Why did he call you Dai Shin?

46:02.010 --> 46:04.512
I hate it when he calls me that.

46:17.650 --> 46:19.652
It's the title...

46:21.613 --> 46:24.073
...given to future kings
of Malkier.

46:28.369 --> 46:30.371
Not that it matters.

46:31.414 --> 46:34.459
Malkier was taken
by the Blight so long ago.

46:39.506 --> 46:41.799
Who is he?

46:41.883 --> 46:44.469
He treats you like a son.

46:46.679 --> 46:49.390
He was one
of my father's armsmen.

46:51.226 --> 46:53.728
And on the night that Malkier

46:53.811 --> 46:56.898
was overrun by the Blight,

46:56.981 --> 46:59.442
my family was slaughtered.

47:01.736 --> 47:04.113
They...

47:04.197 --> 47:07.200
smuggled me out of the palace.

47:09.577 --> 47:11.955
And brought you here?

47:27.679 --> 47:31.099
You know...

47:31.182 --> 47:35.061
I never quite understood why you
bonded yourself to Moiraine.

47:38.773 --> 47:40.858
And now you do?

47:43.528 --> 47:47.073
You are a king
without a kingdom.

47:47.156 --> 47:49.284
A boy without a family.

47:51.828 --> 47:56.124
And now you finally belong.

47:57.125 --> 47:59.252
To her.

48:17.270 --> 48:19.814
She doesn't own me.

48:19.897 --> 48:22.483
Doesn't she?

48:22.567 --> 48:26.988
Only in the way
those kids own you. Hmm?

48:28.906 --> 48:31.618
"A Wisdom never weds."

48:38.958 --> 48:40.335
Hey.

48:44.547 --> 48:46.716
Stay.

49:09.781 --> 49:11.449
- Over here!
-

49:12.408 --> 49:15.328
<i>-</i>

49:15.411 --> 49:17.330
I'll get you there.

49:17.413 --> 49:18.665
I'll get you to Nynaeve.

49:23.586 --> 49:25.171
Kari.

49:26.214 --> 49:27.590
<i>Kari.</i>

49:27.674 --> 49:29.008
<i>It was so hot.</i>

49:29.092 --> 49:30.426
<i>I didn't mean</i>

49:30.510 --> 49:31.844
to find her there,

49:31.928 --> 49:33.179
but I had to get away,

49:33.262 --> 49:35.723
<i>up the mountain into the snow.</i>

49:35.807 --> 49:37.350
<i>He was crying.</i>

49:37.433 --> 49:39.769
- Dad...
- He was so tiny.

49:39.852 --> 49:40.853
What are you talking about?

49:51.280 --> 49:52.699
That door
is made of ironwood.

49:52.782 --> 49:54.951
<i>Three men your size
couldn't break it down.</i>

50:00.790 --> 50:03.209
That mountain,
I think I've seen it before.

50:12.802 --> 50:14.053
It's you.

50:14.137 --> 50:17.515
<i>You've always known it's you,
deep down.</i>

50:17.598 --> 50:19.600
<i>No matter how fast
or how far you run,</i>

50:19.684 --> 50:22.019
<i>you cannot escape your fate.</i>

50:22.103 --> 50:24.313
-
<i>- You are the Dragon Reborn.</i>

50:24.397 --> 50:28.276
<i>You</i> are <i>the Dragon Reborn.</i>

50:28.359 --> 50:29.444
No!

50:29.527 --> 50:31.821
We're closed.

50:33.698 --> 50:34.866
Oh, it's you.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.243
Did you know I was coming?

50:37.326 --> 50:40.246
Yeah, it sort of comes
with the territory.

50:40.329 --> 50:42.123
What do you want?

50:42.206 --> 50:44.584
I want you to tell me

50:44.667 --> 50:47.170
that I'm not the Dragon Reborn.

50:47.253 --> 50:48.713
Okay, you're not
the Dragon Reborn.

50:48.796 --> 50:50.298
You don't have to protect
my feelings.

50:50.381 --> 50:51.424
I definitely don't care
how you feel.

50:51.507 --> 50:53.384
You're just another guy
in another bar

50:53.468 --> 50:54.510
that wants something from me.

50:54.594 --> 50:56.095
I-I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

50:56.179 --> 50:57.889
I'm sorry,
I didn't even introduce myself.

50:57.972 --> 50:59.682
I know who you are.

51:01.309 --> 51:02.935
Look me in the eye and tell me

51:03.019 --> 51:05.271
that you want to know
what I've got to say.

51:05.354 --> 51:08.733
Because once you do,
there's no turning back.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.071
<i>It was the first vision
I ever had.</i>

51:14.155 --> 51:16.157
I was a kid...

51:16.240 --> 51:19.535
walking down a damp alleyway
in Tar Valon.

51:22.246 --> 51:26.667
And when I turned a corner,
I saw a man in armor

51:26.751 --> 51:29.879
carrying your heron-marked blade.

51:42.225 --> 51:44.477
<i>And when I looked at him...</i>

51:47.522 --> 51:50.525
-
<i>- ...I saw snow and blood.</i>

51:56.113 --> 52:00.243
<i>I saw a baby born
on the slopes of Dragonmount.</i>

52:20.096 --> 52:22.807
<i>The man raised him
in a wooden house</i>

52:22.890 --> 52:25.977
<i>beside fields of sheep,</i>

52:26.060 --> 52:29.188
<i>in a sleepy village surrounded
by two rivers.</i>

52:32.233 --> 52:34.235
<i>And that baby...</i>

52:36.737 --> 52:38.948
...that baby was
something impossible.

53:02.388 --> 53:04.557
What do you see now...

53:04.640 --> 53:06.642
when you look at me?

53:07.685 --> 53:11.814
Rainbows and carnivals
and three beautiful women.

53:19.155 --> 53:20.781
Do you see...

53:20.865 --> 53:22.366
the Eye of the World?

53:22.450 --> 53:24.744
- Wish I didn't.
- Why?

53:24.827 --> 53:27.496
Well, you seem like
a decent person.

53:27.580 --> 53:30.499
Do I make it back?

53:35.630 --> 53:38.507
I didn't think so.

53:55.650 --> 53:57.234
Nynaeve?

54:30.643 --> 54:32.478
And where have you been?

54:32.561 --> 54:36.732
- Nowhere.
- I mean, you've been somewhere.

54:36.816 --> 54:39.110
And by the looks
of this perfectly made bed,

54:39.193 --> 54:41.112
it wasn't in your room.

54:41.195 --> 54:43.239
I couldn't sleep.

54:43.322 --> 54:45.408
Hmm.

54:50.037 --> 54:52.957
I owe you an apology.

54:53.040 --> 54:55.001
I spoke out of turn.

54:55.084 --> 54:57.461
I didn't mean
to stir anything up.

55:12.935 --> 55:15.438
So, what did you decide?

55:25.865 --> 55:28.409
I want to go.

55:37.710 --> 55:39.045
Where's Rand?

55:40.087 --> 55:42.089
I assumed he was with you.

56:04.445 --> 56:05.821
What happened?

56:10.951 --> 56:13.621
It's me.

56:18.751 --> 56:20.878
Moiraine masked our bond.

56:23.714 --> 56:25.216
I don't understand.

56:25.299 --> 56:27.676
She left.

56:27.760 --> 56:28.969
By herself?

56:30.012 --> 56:32.139
Rand.

56:47.279 --> 56:49.740
What is that?

56:49.824 --> 56:51.492
The Blight.

56:51.575 --> 56:54.495
We have to go through it
to get to the Eye of the World.
