I'm pretty sure breakfast
is one of my favorite meals
of the day.

01:15.708 --> 01:18.875
It definitely ties for first
with lunch and...

01:18.875 --> 01:21.375
Let's see... dinner!

01:21.375 --> 01:23.333
Do you have to make such a mess
when you're eating?

01:23.333 --> 01:26.250
No. But it's more fun
when we do.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.416
Hey there, pup stars.

01:28.416 --> 01:30.000

-(barking)

01:34.083 --> 01:38.875
I can't wait to make myself

01:38.875 --> 01:41.500
Let's see, just need to find
what I need to make it.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.875
Some eggs, some milk,
and--

01:43.875 --> 01:46.500
(gasping)

01:46.500 --> 01:49.416
Oh, no!
I'm out of bread!

01:49.416 --> 01:52.166
I can't make French toast
without bread!

01:52.166 --> 01:56.083
Well, that ruins
this morning! (growls)

01:59.583 --> 02:01.458
I'm sorry, guys.

02:01.458 --> 02:04.625
I get as grumpy as a bear
if I don't have French toast.

02:04.625 --> 02:09.375
Well, I'll see you after work,
when hopefully I won't
be so... (growls)

02:09.375 --> 02:11.458

02:11.458 --> 02:14.083
Did you hear that? Bob said
he gets grumpy like a bear

02:14.083 --> 02:15.583
if he doesn't have
French toast.

02:15.583 --> 02:17.833
Imagine what
that would be like.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.000
Oh, I love to imagine.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.875

-Hi, Bob!

02:29.875 --> 02:31.500
-Who are you?
-Where's our Bob?

02:31.500 --> 02:33.291
I'm Bob!

02:33.291 --> 02:36.000
But this is what happens
when I don't have French toast!

02:36.000 --> 02:38.583
I get as grumpy
as one of these.

02:38.583 --> 02:41.000
(growling)

02:42.958 --> 02:45.333
I don't want Bob
being a bear.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.333
I want Bob
being a Bob.

02:47.333 --> 02:51.083
Then we've gotta find
what he needs to make
French toast, fast!

03:23.291 --> 03:24.708

Don't you just
love France, Frank?

03:53.958 --> 03:56.458
So many French
things to see,

03:56.458 --> 03:59.458
like the Eiffel Tower
right there!

03:59.458 --> 04:01.500
I wish there was a French
merry-go-round there,

04:01.500 --> 04:04.458
so I can ride
an up-and-down horsey.

04:04.458 --> 04:07.250
Hmm, I'm not sure
where we're supposed
to start looking

04:07.250 --> 04:09.291
for what we're supposed
to be looking for.

04:09.291 --> 04:12.708
Ooh, this guidebook
says there's a bakery
near here, Frank,

04:12.708 --> 04:15.625
that has the best
French bread in the city!

04:15.625 --> 04:18.958
Sounds yummy. Lead the way,
and my tum-tum will follow.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.083
Follow that tum-tum!

04:29.500 --> 04:34.291
Huh? Where's all the bread?
I thought this bakery
sold bread?

04:34.291 --> 04:36.708
Yeah, all I see is stuff
that dripped out of my nose.

04:36.708 --> 04:38.416
And there's a way
whole lot of it.

04:38.416 --> 04:39.708
(door bells jingle)

04:39.708 --> 04:42.416
I am sorry,
we have no bread today.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.708
Well, that's
just crumby!

04:44.708 --> 04:48.583
I made fresh bread yesterday
and put it out to cool.

04:48.583 --> 04:51.500
But when I went to get it,
it was gone!

04:51.500 --> 04:54.083
I am making more
as quickly as I can.

04:56.583 --> 04:59.708
Are you puppies looking
for French bread,
like everyone else?

04:59.708 --> 05:04.833
Yeah, otherwise Bob's
gonna be all... (growls)
"Where's my French toast?"

05:06.875 --> 05:09.375
I don't get why everyone
is so upset.

05:09.375 --> 05:12.458
I mean, if it was birdseed
that was missing,

05:12.458 --> 05:14.083
muwah, I'd understand,

05:14.083 --> 05:16.500
because we pigeons
love that stuff.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.708
-(door bells jingle)
-Oh!

05:18.708 --> 05:20.833
Oh, no!

05:20.833 --> 05:24.625
Police detective.
Did I hear someone say,
"Oh, no"?

05:24.625 --> 05:28.125
I had more bread
cooling outside,
but it's gone.

05:28.125 --> 05:31.583
Are there any clues
about who might have
taken it?

05:31.583 --> 05:36.458
I did see some tiny footprints
leading away from where
the bread used to be.

05:36.458 --> 05:39.708
Did you hear that, Rolly?
Somebody's been taking
the bread Bob needs

05:39.708 --> 05:41.625
for his French toast!

05:41.625 --> 05:44.125
Which means we've gotta
find out who took it.

05:44.125 --> 05:45.208
How are we gonna do that?

05:45.208 --> 05:47.250
We're gonna follow the clues.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.958
Starting with,
they left tiny footprints.

05:54.583 --> 05:57.750
None of those big feet
would've left tiny footprints.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.583
But those tiny feet would have!

06:00.583 --> 06:03.583
(squeaking)

06:05.583 --> 06:07.583
Stop,
in the name of the paw!

06:07.583 --> 06:09.708
(squeaking)

06:09.708 --> 06:12.000
(gasps)
What? Huh?

06:18.875 --> 06:22.125
Those tiny feet really
move those tiny bodies fast!

06:22.125 --> 06:24.166
Ooh!

06:24.166 --> 06:25.291
Rolly!

06:26.958 --> 06:28.500
What are you--?

06:28.500 --> 06:30.458
Both:
Mmm!

06:30.458 --> 06:33.000
(both panting)

06:35.833 --> 06:37.958
Time's up! Let's go!

06:39.583 --> 06:42.125
(mice squeaking)

06:43.708 --> 06:45.708
If those mice get away,
we'll never find the bread

06:45.708 --> 06:47.708
Bob needs to make
French toast.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.750
They're not getting away.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.833
(squeaking)

06:58.833 --> 07:00.458
Thanks to that awesome

07:00.458 --> 07:03.291
somersault boom thing
my brother did. Boom!

07:03.291 --> 07:06.583
We've got you now,
you tiny-footed
bread-takers!

07:06.583 --> 07:08.500
We did not take any bread.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.875
Then why were
you running away?

07:09.875 --> 07:12.875
Because we were being chased
by two scary-looking dogs.

07:12.875 --> 07:16.000
Scary dogs?
Where'd they go?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.708
We are talking about you.

07:17.708 --> 07:19.458
-Oh.
-Both:
Sorry.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.875
You say more of your bread
is missing?

07:24.875 --> 07:27.708
Oui, oui.
I heard a flapping noise,

07:27.708 --> 07:31.625
and when I went to look,
my fresh batch was gone.

07:31.625 --> 07:35.416
A flapping noise...
that's another clue.

07:35.416 --> 07:36.750
Do you know
what it means?

07:36.750 --> 07:39.625
Yes, I know what the word
"clue" means!

07:39.625 --> 07:41.291
That's one
of the first things

07:41.291 --> 07:43.375
they teach us
at detective school.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.625
Hmm, a flapping noise.

07:45.625 --> 07:48.083
-What do you think might've
made a flapping noise?
-(quacks)

07:48.083 --> 07:49.750
-Duck!
-I'm ducking!

07:49.750 --> 07:51.583
No, the other kind of duck.

07:51.583 --> 07:53.125
Put the clues together:

07:53.125 --> 07:55.875
tiny feet, flapping sound.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.833
The ducks are the ones
who are taking the bread!

07:58.833 --> 08:01.583
Hey, you flappy-sounding,
tiny-footed bread-takers!

08:02.708 --> 08:04.750
Bob can't have French toast
because of you!

08:04.750 --> 08:06.958
(quacking)

08:06.958 --> 08:08.750
Oh, no,
they're getting away!

08:08.750 --> 08:11.083
How are
we gonna stop 'em?

08:11.083 --> 08:13.083
-(thuds)
-(screeches)

08:13.083 --> 08:14.708
I think
we got 'em stopped.

08:14.708 --> 08:17.458
-(rustling)
-(quacks)

08:19.708 --> 08:22.000
We've got you now,
you bread-taking quackers!

08:23.500 --> 08:25.583
Yeah! We followed
all of the clues

08:25.583 --> 08:27.833
that led to your
flapping sounds
and tiny feet.

08:27.833 --> 08:30.875
Well, we do make
flapping sounds,
and our feet are tiny.

08:30.875 --> 08:34.291
-So you admit it.
-But they're also webbed.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.625
None of the clues
said anything about webbed feet.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.583
That's because
we didn't take anything.

08:39.583 --> 08:41.416
Then why were you
running away?

08:41.416 --> 08:43.833
Because two scary-looking dogs
were chasing us!

08:43.833 --> 08:45.583
What? Where?

08:45.583 --> 08:46.958
I think she means us.

08:46.958 --> 08:48.625
-Oh.
-Both:
Sorry.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.833
-My bread was taken again.
-(sniffing)

08:51.833 --> 08:55.708
And I saw tiny footprints
and heard flapping, like before.

08:55.708 --> 08:59.333
But there was also a trail
of bread crumbs

08:59.333 --> 09:02.416
leading away
from the bakery!

09:02.416 --> 09:04.500
Bread crumbs?

09:04.500 --> 09:09.291
Huh! Mon dieu ,
if only there were clues
I could actually follow!

09:09.291 --> 09:12.000
Did you hear that, Rolly?
Bread crumbs!

09:12.000 --> 09:14.750
So all we have to do
is follow that trail
wherever it leads.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.125
(both sniffing)

09:17.125 --> 09:19.875
And that trail leads
right up this tower.

09:19.875 --> 09:24.166
Which means whoever took
that bread is probably
up there right now

09:24.166 --> 09:27.458
with all the bread
that Bob needs to make
his French toast!

09:27.458 --> 09:29.375
So there's one thing
we have to do!

09:29.375 --> 09:30.875
Both:

But where's all the French bread
I thought those bread crumbs
were leading us to?

10:16.250 --> 10:18.000
Huh?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.583
Look! It's up there!

10:19.583 --> 10:22.958
Someone's been hiding
French bread behind the top
of this tower!

10:22.958 --> 10:24.833
Those sneaky
little bread-hiders!

10:24.833 --> 10:27.583
But we still don't know
who's been hiding it here.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.958
Maybe we should ask
those pigeons who are
hiding it here.

10:29.958 --> 10:34.416
Uh-oh, it looks like
we got caught bread-handed.

10:35.833 --> 10:37.458
How did you figure it out?

10:37.458 --> 10:38.708
'Cause we followed the clues.

10:38.708 --> 10:41.583
Yes, we're sorry.
We just got tired

10:41.583 --> 10:43.833
of people feeding us
bread in the park.

10:43.833 --> 10:45.750
So we hid it here,

10:45.750 --> 10:48.708
hoping they would feed us
birdseed instead.

10:48.708 --> 10:52.083
Well, why didn't you
just not eat the bread
they were feeding you?

10:52.083 --> 10:54.750
Yeah. Then people
will feed you birdseed
like you want.

10:54.750 --> 10:59.000
Mwuh! That is one
really good idea.

11:01.750 --> 11:03.208
Bread for sale!

11:03.208 --> 11:06.208
Now that no one
is stealing my bread,

11:06.208 --> 11:09.416
there is plenty
of French bread
for everyone!

11:09.416 --> 11:14.416
Aww, you cute puppies
look like you want
some bread, oui?

11:14.416 --> 11:18.083
I can never say no
to cute puppies.

11:20.875 --> 11:24.208
I don't know why everyone kept
feeding bread to these pigeons.

11:24.208 --> 11:26.958
They like our birdseed
a whole lot more.

11:26.958 --> 11:29.708
Which means there's more
bread for my tum-tum.

11:38.291 --> 11:39.333
Hey, guys!

11:39.333 --> 11:41.208
(barking)

11:41.208 --> 11:43.208
Bingo: Bob, look what
we brought you!

11:43.208 --> 11:44.625
(barking)

11:44.625 --> 11:47.166
Hey! Bread!

11:47.166 --> 11:48.291
Ah! Mm!

11:49.875 --> 11:52.000
What a treat!

11:52.000 --> 11:54.375
Bob seems really happy

11:54.375 --> 11:57.000
that you found bread
for his French toast.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.708
Now he won't be all...
(growls) like a bear.

12:00.708 --> 12:05.000
Ooh, Hissy, your scary bear face
is even better than Rolly's.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.875
This is my normal face.

12:06.875 --> 12:09.583
Oh. Sorry.

12:09.583 --> 12:11.875
(laughing)

12:16.958 --> 12:19.583
Bingo:
"Take Me Out to the Pug Game."

12:21.250 --> 12:24.083
Okay, first one to the stick
gets to take it to Bob.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.875
Which is why I'm gonna be
the first one there.

12:26.875 --> 12:28.875
-On your bark...
-Get set...

12:28.875 --> 12:30.000
Both:
Go!

12:30.000 --> 12:32.875
(panting)

12:32.875 --> 12:35.000
(grunts)

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
(growling)

12:37.000 --> 12:38.958
-Let go!
-You let go!

12:41.125 --> 12:42.875
Whoa! (grunts)

12:42.875 --> 12:44.000
(growls)

12:44.000 --> 12:46.375
Maybe we should both
take the stick to Bob?

12:46.375 --> 12:48.000
I'll go along with that.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.958
(both grunting)

12:56.958 --> 12:58.500
Bingo:
This could take a while.

12:59.958 --> 13:02.208
Here it is, Hissy!

13:02.208 --> 13:06.708
(chuckles)
The baseball I caught
when my favorite player,

13:06.708 --> 13:10.416
Teddy Peppercorn,
hit his very first home run,

13:10.416 --> 13:13.000
and I was at the stadium
to catch it.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.583
Oh, I could stare
at this ball all day.

13:17.583 --> 13:19.166
(both grunting)

13:19.166 --> 13:20.125
We did it!

13:20.125 --> 13:22.000
-Bob, Bob!
-Let's play fetch!

13:22.000 --> 13:24.333
-(barking)
-Hey, there, dog-erinos.

13:24.333 --> 13:27.000
You lookin' for someone
to throw that stick?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.500
Aw, I wish I had time,
but I'm heading out

13:29.500 --> 13:32.375
to buy stuff for the big game
that's on TV.

13:32.375 --> 13:35.833
So it's a good thing
I invented this!

13:37.458 --> 13:40.375
(laughs) It's an automatic
fetch machine!

13:40.375 --> 13:42.958
You put whatever
you wanna fetch right here,

13:42.958 --> 13:45.500
press this button, and...

13:45.500 --> 13:47.166
Both:
Cool!

13:47.166 --> 13:48.500
I got it!

13:48.500 --> 13:51.333
(laughs) Have fun playing
with that fetch machine

13:51.333 --> 13:53.416
-till I get back!
-(front door closes)

13:56.708 --> 13:59.208
(sniffing)

13:59.208 --> 14:02.125
What else besides this stick
do you think we could put
in this machine?

14:02.125 --> 14:04.583
Bob said whatever we want.

14:08.125 --> 14:09.750
Wait a second.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
That thing is perfect.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.583
Yeah, we love chasing balls.
They're so rolly!

14:15.583 --> 14:17.000
(both laughing)

14:17.000 --> 14:18.208
I said my name.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.458
What are you guys doin'?

14:23.458 --> 14:26.291
-We're gonna play fetch.
-With something that's rolly!

14:26.291 --> 14:29.416
-(both laughing)
-I did it again!

14:29.416 --> 14:32.291
Wait a minute.
What are you guys doing
with Bob's special baseball?

14:32.291 --> 14:34.333
Bob's special what?

14:34.333 --> 14:36.833
No!

14:39.000 --> 14:41.291
-(ball thuds)
-Woman: Oh! Hey!
Watch it, up there!

14:43.833 --> 14:46.125
That was the baseball
that Teddy Peppercorn hit

14:46.125 --> 14:49.708
and Bob caught and could stare
at all day long!

14:49.708 --> 14:52.000
Bob's gonna be so sad
if he comes home

14:52.000 --> 14:53.625
and that ball's not here.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.750
Then Rolly and I are gonna
make it our mission

14:55.750 --> 14:58.083
to make sure
that that ball is here.

14:58.083 --> 14:59.375
How are we gonna do that?

14:59.375 --> 15:01.375
You and I are
gonna play fetch.

16:01.708 --> 16:03.250
Let's do it again!

16:03.250 --> 16:07.166
Rolly, no!
Our mission is to get
Bob's baseball before it...

16:10.208 --> 16:13.250
...goes into that elevator!

16:13.250 --> 16:14.708
What do we do now?

16:14.708 --> 16:16.458
(elevator chimes)

16:18.125 --> 16:21.125
(humming)

16:21.125 --> 16:23.208
-Mm?
-(snorting, panting)

16:24.500 --> 16:26.000
Hmm. Huh?

16:29.250 --> 16:30.833
(elevator chimes)

16:37.125 --> 16:39.083
The baseball's
in that bucket.

16:39.083 --> 16:41.250
Then that bucket
is on my list.

16:41.250 --> 16:44.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:54.250 --> 16:56.416
So... that just happened.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.250
What do we do now, Bingo?

17:01.583 --> 17:03.708
Time to collar up!

17:05.375 --> 17:08.166
Bob put these harnesses
in our collars for when
we play at home!

17:08.166 --> 17:10.416
I don't think he'd mind
that we're using them now.

17:10.416 --> 17:13.208
I think he'd love
that we're using them now!

17:13.208 --> 17:15.083
What are we using them
for now?

17:17.333 --> 17:18.500
Rolly:
Ya-hoo!

17:21.208 --> 17:22.625
Bingo:
Detach!

17:22.625 --> 17:26.000
-Ya-hoo!
-Wee! (laughs)

17:33.291 --> 17:34.833
(grunts)

17:34.833 --> 17:36.375
It's bow-wow time.

17:36.375 --> 17:38.000
(grunts)

17:38.000 --> 17:39.708
-Sorry.
-That's okay.

17:39.708 --> 17:42.333
It wasn't the best time
for bow-wow, anyway.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.625
What are you two doing here?

17:45.750 --> 17:47.250
Leave us alone, Cupcake.

17:47.250 --> 17:50.208
-We're on a mission.
-Yeah, we're fetching
Bob's baseball.

17:50.208 --> 17:53.125
Well, I wouldn't
want to get in your way.

17:53.125 --> 17:56.000
Which is why I'll have Rufus
get in your way for me.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.125
(giggles)

17:57.125 --> 17:59.625
(Rufus growling)

17:59.625 --> 18:01.458
(chuckling)

18:01.458 --> 18:03.166
Go Rufus, go!

18:04.291 --> 18:06.000
Hey, give it back!

18:06.000 --> 18:08.166
He's such a little meanie,
isn't he?

18:12.958 --> 18:16.083
Okay, got some chips
and my fruit smoothies
for the game.

18:16.083 --> 18:19.583
Just need to make
a quick stop at the-- Yikes!

18:19.583 --> 18:23.458
Whoa! And he's okay!

18:27.166 --> 18:28.208
(panting)

18:28.208 --> 18:30.333
(barking)

18:34.333 --> 18:35.375
(muttering)

18:35.375 --> 18:36.458
(chuckling)

18:36.458 --> 18:38.333
Bingo:
Hey! Give us our ball
back, Rufus!

18:38.333 --> 18:40.083
(chuckling)

18:40.083 --> 18:41.625
(babbling)

18:41.625 --> 18:43.875
Huh?

18:43.875 --> 18:45.000
Aw. Hmph.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.333
(barking)

18:49.333 --> 18:50.583
(giggling)

18:51.958 --> 18:53.458
(barking)

18:53.458 --> 18:55.000
Both:
Huh?

18:55.000 --> 18:57.333
(barking)

18:57.333 --> 19:00.125
(panting)

19:00.125 --> 19:03.375
Rufus can be a very bad dog
when I tell him to be.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.375
Really sticks to his task.

19:05.375 --> 19:07.458
As long as he doesn't
get distracted by a--

19:07.458 --> 19:08.416
Squirrel!

19:11.333 --> 19:12.416
(screams)

19:12.416 --> 19:14.250
No! Bad dog, Rufus!

19:14.250 --> 19:15.291
Bad!

19:17.458 --> 19:18.875
I got it!

19:21.083 --> 19:24.375
This has got to be
the hardest game of fetch
we have ever played.

19:36.333 --> 19:37.875
Oh, no!

19:39.000 --> 19:42.291
Hello, down there!

19:42.291 --> 19:44.458
Anybody see
a ball down there?

19:47.250 --> 19:50.416
This is bad. That drain
could lead anywhere.

19:50.416 --> 19:54.333
If only we knew someone
who knew where that drain
drains out to.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.333
Rolly, we do!

19:57.833 --> 20:00.416
(laughs)

20:00.416 --> 20:04.000
Well, you guys came
to see the right
junkyard dog.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.083
I can tell you
where pretty much
anything is.

20:10.083 --> 20:13.125
This map shows
where all the drains come out.

20:14.750 --> 20:16.875
You say that ball
rolled in here?

20:16.875 --> 20:19.958
Yeah, after we chased it
through the street and up
an elevator,

20:19.958 --> 20:22.458
and out of mean
ol' Rufus's mouth.
(raspberry)

20:22.458 --> 20:24.875
Sounds like an impressive
game of fetch.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.000
We're on a mission.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.875
Oh. Uh... Right.

20:27.875 --> 20:31.000
Okay, so...
if we follow this drain,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.708
through this pipe,
up, back and around,

20:34.708 --> 20:37.083
that baseball
you're lookin' for

20:37.083 --> 20:40.708
should be comin' out,
right about, here.

20:44.416 --> 20:47.958
-Look at that!
-Bulworth was right.
It came out right there.

20:47.958 --> 20:49.083
(grunts)

20:49.083 --> 20:51.458
You can be the one
to pick it up if you want to.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.875
I do want to!

20:52.875 --> 20:54.000
Umpire:
Play ball!

20:54.000 --> 20:55.500
Wait! What?

20:55.500 --> 20:57.416
That guy took
Bob's baseball!

20:57.416 --> 21:01.375
Well, it is fun to play with,
the way it's so rolly. (giggles)

21:01.375 --> 21:02.583
Announcer:
Hello, baseball fans,

21:02.583 --> 21:05.000
and welcome
to Teddy Peppercorn Day.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.458
And now let's
give a big welcome
to our special guest,

21:08.458 --> 21:09.833
Teddy Peppercorn!

21:09.833 --> 21:13.291
-(crowd cheering)
-Isn't that Bob's
favorite player?

21:13.291 --> 21:15.583
Yeah, and they're giving him
Bob's favorite ball!

21:15.583 --> 21:16.875
Announcer:
Before the game starts,

21:16.875 --> 21:20.000
Teddy is going to recreate
his very first home run.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.333
First, he's signing his name
on the ball.

21:22.333 --> 21:27.583
Then he's going to hit it out
of the park for some lucky fan
to find and keep forever.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.166
What did that announcer say?

21:29.166 --> 21:31.750
Something about Mr. Peppercorn
hitting that ball out
of the park.

21:33.500 --> 21:36.875
-Look at that baseball go!
-Wow! That's a really
solid swing!

21:36.875 --> 21:38.833
Got his whole body behind it.

21:38.833 --> 21:41.625
Announcer:
Whoever finds that baseball
with Teddy's signature on it,

21:41.625 --> 21:44.583
is going to be one happy fan!

21:44.583 --> 21:46.583
We're gonna find
that baseball.

21:46.583 --> 21:48.208
And Bob's the fan
who'll be happy.

-(barking)

22:41.458 --> 22:44.291
Hey, is that
my special baseball?

22:44.291 --> 22:46.458
Well, I can see why you'd
wanna play with that.

22:46.458 --> 22:47.500
It's so rolly.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.708
(laughs)
Hey, I said your name!

22:49.708 --> 22:50.875
(giggles)

22:50.875 --> 22:53.000
But right now,
it's time to watch the game!

22:54.583 --> 22:58.708
I love thinkin' about the day
I caught this ball.

22:58.708 --> 23:04.416
Hey! Teddy Peppercorn
wrote his name here!

23:04.416 --> 23:07.000
Well, I guess I never
turned this thing all the way
around before

23:07.000 --> 23:08.500
to see that it was there!

23:11.291 --> 23:15.000
You know, I should take
you guys to a ballpark
someday, I bet you'd love it!

23:15.000 --> 23:17.750
Of course, you'd probably
wanna run around chasin'
every ball

23:17.750 --> 23:20.458
that was hit out
of the park. (laughs)

23:20.458 --> 23:23.291
Announcer:
It's a long fly ball
to center field...

23:23.291 --> 23:26.500
going, going, gone!
Home run!

23:26.500 --> 23:28.000
Bob:
Woo-hoo! Yay!

23:28.000 --> 23:30.250
(Rolly/Bingo barking)

23:32.291 --> 23:33.625
(theme music playing)

23:35.708 --> 23:36.833
(barking)

23:41.125 --> 23:42.166
(barking)

23:43.583 --> 23:46.083
(rhythmic barking)

23:51.583 --> 23:52.625
(barks)

23:57.000 --> 23:58.125
(barking)
