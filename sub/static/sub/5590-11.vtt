08:13.643 --> 08:14.859
All of this was supposed
to be on absolute lock-down.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.361
That's the way it is now.

08:16.363 --> 08:19.297
It's, you know -- nobody has
any respect for anybody anymore.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.466
No -- nothing is sacred.
But in nashville?

08:21.468 --> 08:23.468

and call me back.

08:26.373 --> 08:29.808
The florist,
but we have bigger problems.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.510
They also leaked
the wedding location.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.278
What?
Yeah.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.313
People are already setting up
near the property --

08:35.315 --> 08:37.482
Photographers, press,
and fans.

08:37.484 --> 08:38.817
And since
it'll be held outdoors,

08:38.819 --> 08:41.720
The worst of it all
will be the helicopters.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.021
I mean, is there something
we can do?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.856
Can we get
a different location?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.892
Well, it's too late to find
a traditional wedding venue.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.394
I know, but, we -- I mean,
we're gonna have to
figure out something.

08:49.396 --> 08:50.829
We can't do it like that.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.064
I want to get married in front
of the people that we love,

08:53.066 --> 08:54.499
Not in front
of the whole damn world.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.135
You know, I have a friend
who has a barn --

08:57.137 --> 08:59.504
What, like, a "barn" barn?

08:59.506 --> 09:00.972
No, not a real one.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.875
It's an off-season event space,
which won't be as pretty,

09:03.877 --> 09:05.377
But it'll be pretty private.

09:05.379 --> 09:08.480
And we could work all night
to set it up,

09:08.482 --> 09:10.415
Start notifying our vendors
and our guests now.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.550
Do it.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.590
Hey.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.025
You okay?

09:20.027 --> 09:22.360
I'm fine.

09:22.362 --> 09:25.530
Hmm. That's the same thing
that daphne said.

09:25.532 --> 09:26.565

Aunt tandy,

What was my dad like
when you first met him?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.706
Why?

09:34.708 --> 09:36.841
I mean, I know he had
drinking problems,

09:36.843 --> 09:39.077
But was that
all there was?

09:39.079 --> 09:42.414
Well, your dad's
come a long way.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.850
And I'll tell you what --
he's always loved your mom.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.919
Always.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.290
We have
a very long day tomorrow,

09:52.292 --> 09:54.526
And you need
to get some sleep.

that place is for you.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.081
It's okay.

10:16.083 --> 10:20.218
No, it's not.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.387
It's another damn thing
gone wrong.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.622
Like a sign or something.

you don't deserve happiness,

10:32.332 --> 10:34.933
'cause you do.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.468
And I do, too.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.970
And we are gonna become a family
tomorrow, damn it,

gonna stop us.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.630
Okay,
this is officially

16:05.632 --> 16:07.832
The strangest wedding
I've ever been to.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.467
You mean
juliette didn't have

16:09.469 --> 16:11.135
All the cellphones confiscated
at yours?
[ laughs ] no.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.770
Thanks.

16:12.772 --> 16:13.905
Hey, man.
How's it going?

16:13.907 --> 16:15.139
Hey, jay, what's up?
How are you?

16:15.141 --> 16:16.407
I'm doing good.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.076
I hear things are going
really well for you

16:18.078 --> 16:19.177
Over there
at highway 65.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.312
Yeah, yeah.
I'm recording an album.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.513
That's great.

16:22.515 --> 16:24.115
Well, I knew it was only
a matter of time for you.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.650
And, uh, how's the missus,
avery?

16:25.652 --> 16:28.252
I haven't seen juliette
in forever.

16:28.254 --> 16:31.689
I barely know her, and I have
no idea where he lives.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.758
She's in london.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.994
"shenandoah girl" might
be headed to the stage.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.962
Wow.
What about luke's tour?

16:37.964 --> 16:40.198
Is she not gonna go back out
on the road at all, or...?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.367
Maybe. Maybe.
Hasn't ruled it out yet.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.868
Well, give her my best,
all right?

16:43.870 --> 16:44.635
I will.
See you around, man.

16:44.637 --> 16:45.903
All right.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.506
[ sighs ]

16:51.344 --> 16:52.677
Hey.
Hi.

16:52.679 --> 16:55.013
Just got here.
What are you doing?

16:55.015 --> 16:56.180
I was just
tweaking the chorus

16:56.182 --> 16:57.849
On that song we recorded
last week.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.317
I thought we could go back in
and fix it.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.852
Scarlett, scarlett.
What?

17:00.854 --> 17:02.620
We're at
your uncle's wedding.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.489
I did notice that.
Can I just --
no, no, no.

17:04.491 --> 17:06.290
You're just --
you're working nonstop,

17:06.292 --> 17:08.192
And you have been
since caleb went to seattle.

17:08.194 --> 17:10.128
You just broke up
with somebody,

17:10.130 --> 17:11.796
And the album can wait,
all right?

17:11.798 --> 17:14.032
You need an erin.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.900
Oh,
I need somebody who says,

17:15.902 --> 17:17.135
"I'm not gonna go
to a formal event with you,

17:17.137 --> 17:18.336
'cause I don't
'do' weddings"?

17:18.338 --> 17:21.406
Well, not that so much,
but you need someone, uh,

17:21.408 --> 17:24.409
Who can keep things light --
someone fun.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.410
And I'm gonna
find one for you.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.011
Come on.
Come on.

17:27.013 --> 17:29.514
Hey. Wh--
come on.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.349
[ knock on door ]

17:31.351 --> 17:32.383
Hey.
Hey.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.352
[ laughs ] sorry,
I know it's bad luck

17:34.354 --> 17:36.020
For us to see each other
before the wedding.

17:36.022 --> 17:38.423
That's all right.
I don't believe in bad luck.
[ chuckles ]

17:38.425 --> 17:39.490
Hi.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.591
Mm.

17:40.593 --> 17:41.993
Where's daphne and tandy?

17:41.995 --> 17:43.394
Uh, they're coming.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.863
I just...Felt like
driving myself over, so...

17:45.865 --> 17:47.498
You all right?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.067
Yeah.
Uh, yeah.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.568
[ laughs nervously ]

17:50.570 --> 17:52.236
I don't know. You know,
first there was maddie,

17:52.238 --> 17:54.505
And -- and then there's,
uh, your sister.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.741
Of course, I know she never did
like me in the first place,

17:56.743 --> 17:58.843
But now there's daphne
all upset with me --

17:58.845 --> 18:01.012
What are you doing?
I'm -- no, I'm serious.

18:01.014 --> 18:03.114
What --
I just went to check in on
daphne this morning, all right?

18:03.116 --> 18:04.715
And she said
she wasn't feeling well.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.417
And then, out of nowhere,
she starts saying,

18:06.419 --> 18:08.052
Like, I don't believe her,
or something,

18:08.054 --> 18:09.620
Getting all upset,
and in comes running tandy

18:09.622 --> 18:11.355
Like she's the calvary
to save the day...
[ chuckles ]

18:11.357 --> 18:12.457
...Like I'd done something.
All right, well, first of all,

18:12.459 --> 18:13.624
You know that's tandy.
Yeah.

18:13.626 --> 18:14.792
Um...
[ sighs ]

18:14.794 --> 18:16.961
And I-I'm sure
daphne's a little anxious.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.396
Yeah.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.730
You get to talk to maddie
at all?

18:19.732 --> 18:21.599
Yeah, I did, and -- and...

18:21.601 --> 18:22.633
What'd she say?

18:22.635 --> 18:24.302
I think she was
a little concerned

18:24.304 --> 18:26.137
About shoving the cameraman,
and all that.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.939
It was just --
baby,
what was I supposed to do?

18:27.941 --> 18:29.273
That guy's -- am I
supposed to let him...

18:29.275 --> 18:30.608
Honey.
...Put that lens
right in her face,

18:30.610 --> 18:31.709
Ask the rude questions?
I know.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.711
I-I told her.
I explained it all to her.

18:33.713 --> 18:34.946
Then what?
What it is?

18:34.948 --> 18:36.214
She mentioned something

18:36.216 --> 18:38.583
About seeing you busting up
beverly's room.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.985
I think she got scared.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.787
She thinks
I'm a monster.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.322
No, she does<i> not</i> think
you're a monster.
No -- yes.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.456
You don't know
what she saw,

18:45.458 --> 18:46.891
And you said yourself
she's afraid of me.

18:46.893 --> 18:47.992
All right, so --
hey.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.595
Don't.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.397
Don't do this.

18:53.399 --> 18:54.699
It's our wedding day.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.668
You're right.

18:59.939 --> 19:01.305
You don't deserve this.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.406
[ chuckles ]

19:02.408 --> 19:03.441
I'm gonna let you --
[ knock on door ]

19:03.443 --> 19:06.444
Oh. I'm gonna let you
get back to it.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.913
Deacon.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.082
Hey, y'all come on in.
Hi, ladies.

19:11.084 --> 19:12.250
Woman: Hi, rayna.
Woman #2: Hi.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.119
Love you.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.054
[ door closes ]
set up right here...

19:18.791 --> 19:21.259
Oh. The groom's room is
down to the right.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.028
Yes, it was scheduled
to be here...

19:33.873 --> 19:35.273
[ seat belt clicks ]

¶¶

19:53.493 --> 19:55.193
[ sighs ]
bucky: Layla.

19:57.163 --> 19:59.697
Hey. When'd you
get back in town?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.299
I don't know
if I am officially,

20:01.301 --> 20:02.967
But I wasn't gonna
miss rayna's wedding

20:02.969 --> 20:04.335
After everything
she's done for me.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.237
Oh, well,
she's been worried about you.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.572
We both have.
So, how you holding up?

20:07.574 --> 20:09.207
Okay.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.209
At least
I've stopped blaming myself

20:11.211 --> 20:13.077
For not making jeff leave
that night.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.413
'cause then it never
would have happened.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.148
But it was
a freak accident.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.684
I know
it wasn't my fault now.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.419
It wasn't anybody's,
really.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.654
Well, I know it probably
doesn't feel this way right now,

20:23.656 --> 20:25.856
But things
will get better.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.192
Hi. Um, I'm looking
for maddie conrad.

20:28.194 --> 20:29.260
Okay.

20:29.262 --> 20:31.028
I'll have someone
take a message to her.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.064
May I have your name,
please?

20:33.066 --> 20:35.233
Uh, never mind.
Thanks.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.867
Hello.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.569
Hey, I was just trying
to call you again.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.704
[ gasps ]

20:39.706 --> 20:43.107
Look how gorgeous you are!
Ohh!

20:43.109 --> 20:45.243
And you, too.
Oh, thank you.

20:45.245 --> 20:49.280
I got her dressed,
and the rest is on you.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.982
Okay?

20:52.252 --> 20:54.118
How you doing,
my sweet girl?

20:54.120 --> 20:55.720
Deacon said
you're not feeling well.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.455
I'm here, aren't I?

20:57.457 --> 20:58.756
Yeah.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.025
Hope you're excited
about it.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.361
Look, honey,
I know it's kind of a crazy day,

21:03.363 --> 21:05.029
And probably lots
of mixed feelings.

21:05.031 --> 21:08.199
You don't know
how I feel, okay?

21:08.201 --> 21:09.734
You're with them.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.435
What do you mean,
I'm with "them"?

21:11.437 --> 21:14.872
It's you, maddie, and deacon --
and that's the family

21:14.874 --> 21:16.641
No, honey,
that is so not true.

21:16.643 --> 21:17.942
Yes, it is.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.311
And aunt tandy doesn't want you
to marry him, either.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.079
What?

21:22.081 --> 21:24.282
Gunnar:
What about that one?

21:24.284 --> 21:26.717
Uh...I think he might be
a little too old.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.752
Huh.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.587
Ooh!
Or this one?

21:29.589 --> 21:31.756
He's wearing a wedding band.
You are terrible at this.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.424
[ sighs ] well, it's pretty hard
to be good at it

21:33.426 --> 21:34.558
From a distance.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.560
You know what?

21:36.562 --> 21:38.229
We got to get closer.
I don't want to get --

21:38.231 --> 21:39.664
Come on, come on.
It'll be fun.

This is my friend scarlett.

Mike. Nice to meet you.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.105
Uh, good to meet you.
Pleasure.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.407
You a guest
of the bride or groom?

21:49.409 --> 21:51.609
I'm here with my mom.
She and rayna grew up together.

21:51.611 --> 21:52.643
Oh!
Oh!

21:52.645 --> 21:54.278
Nice. Say, mike,

21:54.280 --> 21:56.280
Are you into poetry,
music, or animals?

21:56.282 --> 21:57.982
Oh, very much so.
I love animals.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.283
Really?
So does scarlett.

21:59.285 --> 22:01.285
You know what?
How about y'all talk,

22:01.287 --> 22:03.988
And I'm gonna go grab
another drink, okay?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.289

22:05.291 --> 22:06.757
I can't believe
he just did that.

22:06.759 --> 22:07.525
[ chuckles ]
I'm sorry.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.794
Um, you like animals?

22:09.796 --> 22:11.195
Oh, yeah, very much.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.830
I work
with all kinds of pets.

22:12.832 --> 22:16.400
Cats and dogs mainly, but I do
stuff the occasional reptile.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.937
Oh, like taxidermy?

22:19.939 --> 22:23.040
See that?
All me.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.542
Well done.
[ chuckles ]

22:24.544 --> 22:25.710
Oh, wow.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.144
Uh, so, what do you do?

22:27.146 --> 22:29.213
Too bad you can't
find<i> me</i> a date.

22:29.215 --> 22:31.015
[ sighs ]
oh, wait, that's right.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.683
I'm still married.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.151
Whiskey, please.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.320
It hasn't been that hard,
has it?

22:36.322 --> 22:39.390
Well, let's see -- I had to sign
an autograph as juliette's proxy

22:39.392 --> 22:41.325
For a 16-year-old fan,

22:41.327 --> 22:44.528
And then tell rayna's cousin
what a great mom juliette is.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.697
Other than that, yeah,
it's not a problem.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.634
Ow!
I was not waving at you.
I needed to be rescued.

22:50.636 --> 22:52.403
Why would you need
rescuing?

22:52.405 --> 22:54.004
Well,
'cause I don't want to know

22:54.006 --> 22:56.173
Three ways
to scoop out brains.

22:56.175 --> 22:57.975
If we're gonna do this,
we need a signal.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.477
I do this,
you come and get me.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.312
Hey,
maybe that'll work for me.

23:01.314 --> 23:03.581
You know, keep anyone from
asking too many questions.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.216
It's a...?

23:05.218 --> 23:06.117
Yes.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.653
Cash: Hey.

23:09.655 --> 23:12.056
What are you doing
hiding out in here?

23:12.058 --> 23:13.858
I'm just not
in the best mood.

23:13.860 --> 23:16.660
Where's colt?

23:16.662 --> 23:17.695
I thought you said
he was coming.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.196
Haven't seen him yet.

23:19.198 --> 23:22.700
Which would explain
your bad mood.

23:22.702 --> 23:28.506
My dad almost killed my mom
in a car accident.

23:28.508 --> 23:31.208
I know he'd been drinking
and he doesn't do that anymore,

23:31.210 --> 23:33.411
But it's still in there
somewhere.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.179
Of course it is.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.747
Your dad's
a recovering alcoholic.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.582
So is mine.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.618
[ sighs ] just,
for the longest time,

23:40.620 --> 23:43.754
All I wanted was
for my parents to be together.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.723
But now I'm just worried

23:45.725 --> 23:47.591
My mom doesn't see
who he really is.

23:47.593 --> 23:52.229
Maddie, it's impossible
to know anyone completely.

23:52.231 --> 23:57.034
But if your mom's kept deacon
around for 20-some-odd years,

23:57.036 --> 24:00.137
I'm guessing she knows him
better than you do.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.973
Look, I've wanted to write
my father off so many times

24:02.975 --> 24:04.475
For the things he's done.

24:04.477 --> 24:06.710
But cutting people
out of your life is easy.

24:06.712 --> 24:09.580
It's keeping them close
that's hard.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.550
And with alcoholism,
it is harder still,

24:12.552 --> 24:16.887
But being sober is
the ultimate in self-control.

24:16.889 --> 24:20.424
And both
your father and mine,

24:20.426 --> 24:23.060
You know, they care enough
to stay that way,

24:23.062 --> 24:24.528
Which makes us
pretty lucky.

24:26.332 --> 24:27.465
Yeah.

24:27.467 --> 24:29.099
Hey.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.067
Hey.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.403
I heard
you wanted to see me.

24:32.405 --> 24:34.238
Yeah. Would y'all
give us a minute?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.372
Woman: Sure.
Rayna: Thank you so much.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.076
Something wrong?

24:39.078 --> 24:40.978
Well, yeah.
[ door closes ]

24:40.980 --> 24:43.280
And I'm hoping maybe you can
shed some light on it.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.115
You know,
I've got two girls

24:45.117 --> 24:47.485
Who are already dealing with
a lot of issues around this day,

24:47.487 --> 24:50.621
And what I don't need is
my sister fanning the flames

24:50.623 --> 24:52.690
By telling them that
she doesn't like deacon, either.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.191
Rayna,
I never said that!

24:54.193 --> 24:56.293
Well, good.
I'm real glad to hear it.

24:56.295 --> 24:57.294
But, you know,
they can probably tell

24:57.296 --> 24:58.362
By the way
you interact with him.

24:58.364 --> 24:59.964
And you and I both know
it's true.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.600
Well,
and for good reason.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.002
He has a long history
of causing you pain.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.670
And I know
that you believe

25:06.672 --> 25:09.306
That you are some fairy-tale,
meant-to-be couple,

25:09.308 --> 25:12.176
And I -- I have tried
to stay out of it.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.178
But we've been
down this road before.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.146
You can't deny
how volatile he is.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.549
Sure,
he's volatile sometimes.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.718
He's also
the best man that I know.

25:20.720 --> 25:25.289
He is loving and kind
and generous,

25:25.291 --> 25:27.191
And he would give his life
for those two girls

25:27.193 --> 25:28.492
And for me.

25:28.494 --> 25:31.495
But, most important,
he's the man I want to marry.

25:31.497 --> 25:34.365
And not you, not anything
is gonna get in the way of that.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.133
So, you know,
if you can't be here

25:36.135 --> 25:38.202
With your heart
100% invested in this,

25:38.204 --> 25:41.772
Then...You should
just go on.

25:45.912 --> 25:48.212
You're really gonna go?

25:49.715 --> 25:51.081
Nope.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.684
I'm gonna go get
your hair-and-makeup team.

25:53.686 --> 25:56.387
My sister's
getting married.

26:07.233 --> 26:09.600
How'd you know
I was here?

26:09.602 --> 26:11.235
Saw you leave.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.804
It is your wedding day.
I figured I'd follow.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.944
You know,
before the surgery,

26:19.946 --> 26:21.946
I had dreams about dying,
saw signs.

26:23.583 --> 26:24.848
I ignored them.

26:24.850 --> 26:28.185
Now there she is,
and here I am.

26:28.187 --> 26:31.255
Deacon --
me, the lifelong drunk
with a temper.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.792
You know my daughter's
afraid of me?

26:34.794 --> 26:35.893
I can't blame her.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.695
And daphne -- she thinks

26:37.697 --> 26:39.730
I'm trying to take
her daddy's place.

You seriously
getting cold feet?

26:44.070 --> 26:45.302
Not 'cause
I don't love rayna.

26:45.304 --> 26:48.238
Because
you don't deserve her?

your disease talking.

in atlanta with jeff.

on another song together?

Mostly spending time
with our daughter.

started thinking about

for the two of you,

Because, once again, the family
that you know is changing.

Y'all don't have

So let's just hash it out,
right here, right now.

28:45.157 --> 28:49.493
Maddie, deacon is a person
who feels things very deeply.

28:49.495 --> 28:52.496
And sometimes
he's gonna overreact

28:52.498 --> 28:56.233
And he's gonna say things
that he probably shouldn't say,

28:56.235 --> 28:58.736

that I know.
