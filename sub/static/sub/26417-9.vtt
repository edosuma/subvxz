I only call you Will Smith
because you're a good kid.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.234
And you're lucky.

17:47.267 --> 17:51.271
You don't have to live
a hard life unless you want to.

17:51.304 --> 17:52.305
You want to try?

17:55.342 --> 17:56.576
Ugh!

17:56.609 --> 17:57.610
Oh damn, it burns!

17:57.644 --> 17:59.446
Holy crap!
How do you handle that?!

17:59.479 --> 18:01.248
[ Laughs ]
[ Coughing ]

18:01.281 --> 18:02.782
**

18:02.815 --> 18:05.718
And remember,
like actual sand turtles,

18:05.752 --> 18:07.454
you need to keep returning
to the resort

18:07.487 --> 18:10.056
and laying your eggs
of love.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.791
Now, snaps for everyone.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.593
[ Snapping fingers ]

18:13.626 --> 18:14.794
[ Sighs ]

18:14.827 --> 18:17.297
What a miserable weekend.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.667
Here comes Starfish.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.935
Oh, my God, you guys,

18:22.969 --> 18:25.305
this has been
such an amazing weekend.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.440
Right? Hey, we should keep
these good times going, huh?

18:27.474 --> 18:28.508
You want to have a drink?

18:32.011 --> 18:33.513
No, I don't want to.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.982
Okay.
Uh, are you sure?

18:36.015 --> 18:38.117
Yeah.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.153
Oh, I'm so sorry
about him.

18:40.187 --> 18:43.456
He hates drinks.
And he hates good times.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.325
If it were up to me,
I would totally go.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.260
Great,
just the three of us, then.

18:47.294 --> 18:51.364
Huh?
First round of Mai Tais
is on Ken, okay?

18:51.398 --> 18:52.799
So, you a fan of the Devil Rays
yet?

18:52.832 --> 18:54.334
Nope, I'm out.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.469
I just remembered --

18:56.503 --> 18:59.806
I can't go get drinks with you
because I don't like you.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.309
Bye.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.280
Ugh.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.281
I couldn't do it.
I broke.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.516
I saw.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.650
I don't know
how you do it.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.286
My cheeks hurt
from fake-smiling so hard.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.821
I don't know how you could
be the bad guy.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.356
My heart is beating
so fast.

19:16.389 --> 19:17.724
You would've gone to the bar
with them.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.326
Yeah, and I would've bought
season tickets

19:19.359 --> 19:20.360
to the Devil Rays.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.529
You're right.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.631
I do like
being the bad guy.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.799
Yeah, but instead of hanging you
out to dry,

19:26.833 --> 19:28.368
I could do a better job
of supporting you.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.002
And maybe once in a while

19:30.036 --> 19:33.640
I could tone down
my public thunder.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.542
Oh, crap.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.009
She was right.
We did need this.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.745
Mm.

19:38.778 --> 19:39.746
Penguin hug?

19:39.779 --> 19:41.881
Yes.

19:41.914 --> 19:48.588
**

19:48.621 --> 19:50.857
Action.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.492
Mom, Dad, you're home!

19:52.525 --> 19:53.526
Emery:
How was your vacation?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.595
You must be so tired.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.730
The type of tired
where cooking sounds terrible.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.099
Hey, yeah, great point,
Evan.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.001
What do you say
we order a pizza?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.536
What an idea, Emery!

20:03.570 --> 20:05.572
Nice try.
You're not getting pizza.

20:05.605 --> 20:09.108
Both: [ Chanting ] Pizza!
Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!

20:09.141 --> 20:10.743
You heard your mom.
No pizza.

20:14.113 --> 20:15.615
[ Exhales sharply ]
That was so hard.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.216
Don't worry.
It gets easier.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.852
Y'know, after two days of guava,
pizza did sound good.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.121
We'll order one
after they go to bed.

20:26.259 --> 20:29.629
Okay, Grandma, let's kick
this off Big Willie-style...

20:30.797 --> 20:32.231
Hey!
What was that for?

20:32.265 --> 20:34.367
You're tougher
than I thought.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.068
You have graduated
to Mase.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.939
* What you know
about goin' out? *

20:39.972 --> 20:41.207
* Head west, red Lex *

20:41.240 --> 20:42.775
* TVs all up in the headrest *
I'll take it.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.277
* Try and live it up *
Mase is way harder
than Will Smith.

20:44.311 --> 20:45.778
* Ride true, bigger truck,
piece all glittered up *

20:45.812 --> 20:47.380
* Stick up kid, what? *

20:47.414 --> 20:49.916
* Bad, bad, bad, bad boy *
* Yeah *

20:49.949 --> 20:52.118
Delivery tax.
* You make me feel so good *

20:52.151 --> 20:53.653
* Bad boy *
* You know you make me feel
so good *

20:53.686 --> 20:54.854
* You know you make me feel
so good *

20:59.459 --> 21:01.928
Radio DJ: Congratulations,
you're caller number 12!

21:01.961 --> 21:03.596
You've won
our weekly giveaway --

21:03.630 --> 21:04.631
We don't want
the prize.

21:04.664 --> 21:05.665
Uh, excuse me?

21:05.698 --> 21:06.999
You lied to us.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.969
We thought we were getting
a relaxing resort vacation,

21:10.002 --> 21:11.938
instead, you made us work
on our marriage.

21:11.971 --> 21:13.773
Not cool, bro.
Not cool.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.775
I -- I'm sorry?

21:15.808 --> 21:17.610
Yeah, you should be.
Okay.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.680
Well, do you still want
the prize you just won, or...?

21:20.713 --> 21:21.981
What is it?

21:22.014 --> 21:23.783
A package of hand towels!

21:23.816 --> 21:25.184
Yes, yes,
a hundred percent yes.
Now, that's a prize.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.386
Ooh, party!
