00:34.181 --> 00:39.223
My story is much too sad to be told

00:39.895 --> 00:43.347
But practically everything

00:43.482 --> 00:47.895
Leaves me totally cold

00:49.447 --> 00:54.654
The only exception I know is the case

00:54.785 --> 00:59.079
When I'm out on a quiet spree

00:59.206 --> 01:04.283
Fighting vainly the old ennui

01:04.420 --> 01:09.212
And I suddenly turn and see

01:09.550 --> 01:15.754
Your fabulous face

01:16.599 --> 01:23.847
I get no kick from champagne

01:23.981 --> 01:26.602
Mere alcohol

01:26.734 --> 01:30.566
Doesn't thrill me at all

01:30.696 --> 01:37.612
So tell me why should it be true

01:38.037 --> 01:45.867
That I get a kick out of you?

01:46.212 --> 01:53.175
I get no kick in a plane

01:53.594 --> 01:59.846
Flying too high with some guy in the sky

01:59.975 --> 02:06.974
Is my idea of nothing to do

02:07.108 --> 02:14.771
Yet I get a kick out of you

02:14.907 --> 02:17.742
I get a kick

02:17.868 --> 02:24.867
Out of you

02:29.839 --> 02:34.833
It's funny because I think
I can even remember being born.

02:34.969 --> 02:39.097
For the first two weeks of my life,
I didn't have a name.

02:39.223 --> 02:41.892
- Dede couldn't make up her mind.
- Hi, kid.

02:42.810 --> 02:44.849
She finally decided on Fred.

02:45.646 --> 02:50.107
She said she'd never heard of
a little kid named Fred before.

02:51.027 --> 02:55.605
When I'm dancin' at Radio City once a
week, you can have fries when you want.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.981
But right now, you gotta eat this shit.

02:58.117 --> 03:00.442
- Yes, you do.
- No.

03:00.578 --> 03:02.238
- No?
- No.

03:02.371 --> 03:07.199
If you think I'm gonna say "choo-choo"
to get you to open up your mouth...

03:07.334 --> 03:11.035
...you got another think comin'.
- Koffer.

03:12.089 --> 03:16.917
What is with you today, huh?
No koffer. That's food for you to eat, OK?

03:17.053 --> 03:21.299
- Koffer, Mommy.
- No, Fred. That's a plate. No koffer.

03:21.557 --> 03:23.763
Koffer!

03:23.893 --> 03:27.309
Look. All right? No koffer, it's a plate.

03:30.149 --> 03:32.023
Jesus.

03:34.445 --> 03:35.725
Koffer.

03:47.541 --> 03:53.295
By the time I was in first grade, it
was obvious I wasn't like everybody else.

03:56.926 --> 03:59.547
Definitely not like Matt Montini.

04:00.638 --> 04:03.307
He's the kid I admire most.

04:05.893 --> 04:08.894
Matt Montini is always
kickball team captain.

04:10.564 --> 04:13.234
Matt Montini always has
someone to eat lunch with.

04:13.359 --> 04:16.111
- What about Fred?
- Tate's a wuss.

04:19.365 --> 04:20.942
Oof!

04:21.075 --> 04:24.408
- What a dork!
- Tate's a loser!

04:31.502 --> 04:35.120
What the worid needs now

04:35.256 --> 04:37.544
Is love sweet love

04:37.675 --> 04:40.462
At first my teacher,
Miss Nimvel, told Dede...

04:40.594 --> 04:44.213
...that I never paid attention,
that I was probably retarded...

04:44.348 --> 04:49.769
...and that I had a very limited future
as a citizen of the United States.

04:49.895 --> 04:53.893
Then, a week later, she said
I should probably skip second grade...

04:54.024 --> 04:57.856
...maybe even skip
elementary school altogether.

05:02.700 --> 05:05.736
All I want is someone to eat lunch with.

05:11.042 --> 05:13.959
Ladies and gentlemen, who's next?

05:14.587 --> 05:16.378
Fred Tate?

05:16.630 --> 05:18.919
Fred Tate!

05:27.683 --> 05:29.723
Freak!

05:29.852 --> 05:32.473
All right. Let's all be good citizens...

05:32.605 --> 05:34.977
...and be very, very quiet for Fred.

05:37.735 --> 05:39.858
Oh, a visitor.

05:39.987 --> 05:42.609
How lovely to see you, Miss Tate.

05:42.948 --> 05:46.199
Fred and I are just getting
ready to do a little duet.

05:46.535 --> 05:48.528
The kid's got an appointment.

05:48.788 --> 05:53.496
Then we'll just make it one quickie
little verse, if that's all right with you.

05:53.626 --> 05:56.413
- Yeah, whatever.
- Fred.

05:57.421 --> 06:00.458
What the worid needs now

06:00.591 --> 06:02.963
Is love sweet love

06:03.094 --> 06:06.712
It's the only thing
that there's just too little of

06:07.306 --> 06:12.051
- You were playing backwards again.
- It's a stupid song, Dede.

06:15.689 --> 06:19.105
People are always
asking me who my dad is.

06:19.235 --> 06:23.897
Dede says I don't have a dad.
She says I'm the Immaculate Conception.

06:24.865 --> 06:28.649
That's a pretty big responsibility
for a little kid.

06:38.337 --> 06:42.916
His allergies might be getting better,
but I see no improvement in the stomach.

06:43.050 --> 06:45.375
Has he been following the diet?

06:45.511 --> 06:48.714
Fred just doesn't like baby food.
He never liked it.

06:48.848 --> 06:53.011
Does he like havin' an ulcer?
Dede, if he doesn't follow the diet...

06:53.144 --> 06:56.595
...he's not gonna get better.
That's as simple as that.

06:57.523 --> 07:00.524
Jeez, drink a little water,
will you, Freddie?

07:01.861 --> 07:04.316
- I spilt some.
- So you did.

07:04.447 --> 07:08.610
Why don't you wait for me at the table?
We're almost through here.

07:09.785 --> 07:11.778
I tell you, Dede...

07:11.912 --> 07:16.705
...I've seen cops on the bomb squad
with better stomachs than he's got.

07:16.834 --> 07:19.586
- He does worry a lot.
- About what?

07:21.047 --> 07:23.253
About the worid. About me.

07:24.592 --> 07:28.292
The only thing he should be
worrying about is a loose tooth.

07:28.804 --> 07:31.841
He's got his whole adult life
to be miserable.

07:33.809 --> 07:36.181
Hey, you know what day
next Saturday is?

07:36.312 --> 07:39.396
You get your period.
I spend the day alone in the park.

07:39.523 --> 07:42.097
Very funny, lame-o. It's your birthday.

07:43.778 --> 07:46.482
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

07:57.792 --> 08:00.330
Fred!

08:00.461 --> 08:02.584
Hey, turn that up. It's a good one.

08:04.882 --> 08:07.753
Wait a minute. Get your shoes on.
There you go.

08:08.386 --> 08:11.505
Getting heavy.
Care to cut a rug, handsome?

08:12.848 --> 08:14.971
Huh? Remember how I showed you?

08:15.101 --> 08:17.140
Whoo!

08:50.720 --> 08:54.302
This one calls himself Joey X
but his real name is Joseph Zimmerman.

08:54.432 --> 08:56.341
12 years old. Experimental painter.

08:56.684 --> 08:59.601
He's currently working
on a $200,000 commission...

08:59.729 --> 09:03.098
...for Hiroshi Electronics
corporate headquarters in Tokyo.

09:03.232 --> 09:06.067
- What does he call this painting?
- "Irony".

09:06.193 --> 09:08.233
Write him down, please.

09:10.239 --> 09:14.486
Cherry Reynolds. 10 years old. Just
published a volume of feminist poetry.

09:14.618 --> 09:18.533
In the preface, she refers to
the American housewife as, and I quote...

09:18.664 --> 09:23.041
..."A pathetic slamhound with
no notion of self-worth whatsoever."

09:23.919 --> 09:28.083
- Whatever I pay you, it's not enough.
- True.

09:28.215 --> 09:32.924
Fred Tate. Seven years old. Second
grader at Eisenhower Elementary School.

09:33.054 --> 09:38.510
He writes poetry, paints in oils and water,
plays the piano at competition level...

09:38.642 --> 09:42.972
...all the while maintaining
unlimited skills in math and physics.

09:43.814 --> 09:46.436
I can't explain it, Jane.

09:46.567 --> 09:48.939
It's not so much what he knows, but...

09:50.404 --> 09:52.313
...what he understands.

09:54.325 --> 09:56.697
"Death". There stands death,

09:56.827 --> 09:59.994
A bluish distillate
in a cup without a saucer.

10:00.164 --> 10:02.702
Such a strange place to find a cup,

10:02.833 --> 10:05.159
Standing on the back of a hand.

10:05.294 --> 10:08.793
Oh, shooting star that fell
into my eyes and through my body:

10:08.923 --> 10:11.840
Not to forget you. To endure.

10:24.021 --> 10:27.437
- Has this boy been tested?
- Just the Stanford-Binet.

10:27.566 --> 10:29.689
His numbers are here.

10:29.819 --> 10:32.274
This is extraordinary.

10:33.864 --> 10:37.529
- Where's the rest of his stuff?
- Apparently...

10:37.660 --> 10:40.412
...the mother refuses
to let him take any other tests.

10:40.579 --> 10:42.489
What about the father?

10:42.623 --> 10:46.039
- I don't know what happened to him.
- She probably doesn't either.

10:46.168 --> 10:51.625
- Did you send them our material?
- Yes, but I don't know if she'll respond.

10:51.757 --> 10:53.797
Well, keep trying.

10:54.802 --> 10:56.676
Stupid woman.

10:56.804 --> 10:59.971
M- A-I T-A-I.

11:00.099 --> 11:03.100
Mai tai. Did I say "margarita"?

11:03.227 --> 11:05.267
I don't think so.

11:07.064 --> 11:09.602
Scotch rocks, vodka tonic and a Bud.

11:10.151 --> 11:14.611
The kid's mind is just somewhere else.
Maybe he's bored or somethin'.

11:15.698 --> 11:18.615
He hasn't said anything, but I can tell.

11:18.743 --> 11:22.361
- Have you heard a word I said?
- Yeah, Dede. I always hear you.

11:22.496 --> 11:24.453
Today your kid's bored.

11:24.582 --> 11:27.073
Yesterday he was having
some funny nightmares.

11:27.209 --> 11:30.127
He woke up inside of some painting
I never even heard of.

11:30.254 --> 11:34.715
Day before that, correct me if I'm wrong,
he wrote you an opera for Mother's Day.

11:34.842 --> 11:37.843
I mean, Jesus, Dede,
if anyone's bored, it's me.

11:37.970 --> 11:40.841
Am I that bad? Sorry.

11:41.891 --> 11:42.886
Psst!

11:43.017 --> 11:44.594
- What?
- Come here.

11:44.727 --> 11:47.052
- What?
- I got a line on somethin'.

11:47.188 --> 11:48.730
Yeah?

11:48.856 --> 11:52.688
Guy comes in here yesterday.
He owns this big hotel down in Orlando.

11:52.818 --> 11:56.650
They do a show every night
and he says he needs dancers.

11:58.324 --> 12:01.029
Look at this place. It's beautiful.

12:01.452 --> 12:06.410
Oh, come on, Gina. I ain't danced since
I was 19. And even then, I wasn't so hot.

12:06.540 --> 12:09.328
And there is the matter
of my big, fat ass too.

12:09.460 --> 12:12.212
Please, we're talkin' Orlando, honey.
Not Vegas.

12:12.338 --> 12:15.789
Down there, if you can tap your feet,
you're Madonna.

12:16.926 --> 12:20.461
I say we go down there for the summer
and make a vacation out of it.

12:20.596 --> 12:23.882
Hey, you two wanna blab,
go work for the phone company.

12:24.016 --> 12:28.096
Why don't you take a pill, ape-shape?
We're tryin' to talk here.

12:30.439 --> 12:32.895
Well, the place does look really nice.

12:34.443 --> 12:36.899
Fred does like to swim.

12:45.371 --> 12:48.656
Contrary to what
you're saying, Ms Montoya...

12:48.791 --> 12:52.954
...welfare is in fact bad for minorities.

12:53.087 --> 12:59.006
As a social worker, every day you must
see people who have simply given up.

12:59.135 --> 13:02.136
And who's to blame them?

13:02.263 --> 13:07.008
I mean, with people like yourself fighting
for bigger and bigger hand-outs...

13:07.143 --> 13:08.886
...there's no incentive...

13:21.615 --> 13:24.153
- Dede?
- Mm.

13:24.285 --> 13:26.527
Wake up.

13:26.662 --> 13:28.904
What? What's wrong, kid, huh?

13:29.790 --> 13:31.866
You sick?

13:32.001 --> 13:34.456
You feel OK to me.

13:34.587 --> 13:37.042
This is for you.

13:38.507 --> 13:40.796
Looks like somebody already opened it,
huh?

13:40.926 --> 13:45.220
It's from the Grierson School.
They wanna meet us.

13:45.347 --> 13:47.803
Yeah, yeah. I can read, Fred.

13:49.185 --> 13:52.969
Do me a favour. I had a bad night.
Go get your mother a Coke, OK?

13:53.939 --> 13:56.395
Come on, I'd do it for you.

14:00.279 --> 14:05.404
This jerk, he's got all his stuff
separated into whites, off-whites...

14:05.534 --> 14:08.204
...whites with stripes,
whites with polka dots.

14:08.329 --> 14:11.780
He's got ten dryers all to himself.
Drivin' me crazy.

14:11.957 --> 14:14.246
So you know what I do?

14:14.377 --> 14:18.920
I go outside and I kick his car
so that his siren goes off.

14:19.048 --> 14:22.464
So the alarm's goin' off. He comes
back in screamin' and he goes...

14:22.593 --> 14:25.262
..."Hey! What happened to my briefs?"

14:25.388 --> 14:29.006
So you know what I do?
I start talkin' like I don't speak English.

14:37.483 --> 14:42.394
- Hey! Did I hit anybody?
- I'm trying to read.

14:42.530 --> 14:45.365
What are you such
a crabby appleton for, huh?

14:47.868 --> 14:50.490
"The Mathematician". Any good?

14:51.580 --> 14:55.032
"The MatheMagician".
It's Jane Grierson's new book.

14:55.668 --> 14:57.376
Oh.

14:57.503 --> 15:00.041
Jane Grierson again. Great!

15:00.214 --> 15:04.959
This boy, Damon Wells, can multiply
two columns of 2-digit numbers...

15:05.094 --> 15:07.383
...in five minutes.

15:08.013 --> 15:09.971
Oh.

15:10.099 --> 15:13.799
When Jane Grierson found him,
he was living in a foster home.

15:13.936 --> 15:16.392
Now he travels all over the place.

15:17.398 --> 15:18.975
Really?

15:19.108 --> 15:24.529
Dr Grierson played the violin for the
Cleveland Philharmonic when she was 11.

15:25.322 --> 15:28.240
Is the book about her or the kid?

15:31.871 --> 15:34.825
Looks like a real bozo in that cape.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.339
Quit it.

15:47.678 --> 15:50.252
You got no sense of humour,
you know that?

15:52.892 --> 15:56.972
All right, you win. Come on, let's go.
Put your shoes on. Come on!

16:06.197 --> 16:10.194
Hi. Garth Emmerick.
I'm Dr Grierson's assistant.

16:11.911 --> 16:15.576
Dede Tate. The place is... It's nice.

16:17.083 --> 16:20.831
You must be Fred. All set?

16:20.961 --> 16:24.247
Dr Grierson likes to meet
the children by themselves.

16:24.507 --> 16:28.801
Feel free to wander around.
The interview should take a while.

16:30.805 --> 16:35.098
It's OK, Fred. I'll meet you right
back down here when you get out.

16:35.267 --> 16:38.138
All right? OK?

16:54.245 --> 16:58.077
Make sure Jake takes
the full course of antibiotics.

17:00.710 --> 17:05.039
We wouldn't want him to come down with
some ear infection and miss the test.

17:05.798 --> 17:11.253
I'm sorry. I realise at some schools letters
of recommendation carry influence...

17:11.387 --> 17:15.930
...but here it's really test performance
that determines admission.

17:16.726 --> 17:19.762
Did Garth give you
a copy of our pretest diet?

17:19.895 --> 17:22.433
Well, you have to make sure
he stays on that diet.

17:22.565 --> 17:24.604
We'll see you in two weeks.

17:26.694 --> 17:29.019
Hello, Fred.

17:29.780 --> 17:33.398
I'm Jane Grierson.
Do you know why you're here?

17:35.745 --> 17:37.784
How do you feel about it?

17:38.873 --> 17:40.331
I'm hot.

17:40.458 --> 17:43.127
Dominis. Dominos. Dominis.

17:43.794 --> 17:48.255
- Again.
- Dominus. Domini. Domino.

17:48.382 --> 17:50.707
Dominum. Domino.

17:51.761 --> 17:55.295
Now, Fred. What's wrong in this picture?

18:09.487 --> 18:11.526
This?

18:13.074 --> 18:17.949
- This?
- I wake up in his paintings sometimes.

18:24.377 --> 18:26.416
Van Gogh.

18:44.355 --> 18:47.522
I wonder why he only
painted one iris white.

18:48.651 --> 18:51.106
Because he was Ionely.

18:54.782 --> 18:56.821
Let's look at May.

19:01.914 --> 19:03.954
I like Sunflowers best.

19:04.083 --> 19:06.122
Mm.

19:11.340 --> 19:13.712
I understand you're quite a pianist.

19:48.878 --> 19:50.455
Check!

20:26.999 --> 20:29.371
That was lovely.

20:29.502 --> 20:32.253
Thank you very much.
I really enjoyed that.

20:33.297 --> 20:36.832
Hey, Fred. I gotta go to work. Come on.

20:37.093 --> 20:40.212
Ms Tate. I'm Jane Grierson.

20:41.472 --> 20:43.511
Please, come in. Sit down.

20:50.481 --> 20:54.431
- Your son is very talented.
- Yeah, I know.

20:57.488 --> 21:02.779
Every year, I take five students
to compete in "Odyssey of the Mind".

21:02.910 --> 21:06.742
It's a kind of mental Olympics, if you will.

21:07.081 --> 21:09.120
They're going to Disney Worid.

21:10.376 --> 21:13.792
That's not the first thing
I would have told you, but it's true.

21:13.921 --> 21:17.788
We stop many places along the way,
including my ranch in Virginia.

21:17.925 --> 21:22.552
I like to pack as much learning
experience into the three weeks as I can.

21:24.515 --> 21:27.302
Yeah, well, I gotta go. Gettin' late.

21:30.980 --> 21:33.138
Ms Tate. Ms Tate, please.

21:34.442 --> 21:36.434
I didn't make myself clear.

21:36.569 --> 21:39.024
I'm inviting your son to come with us.

21:39.155 --> 21:43.817
If he enjoys himself, he'll be free
to enrol in my school in the fall.

21:44.910 --> 21:48.955
Wait a minute. Um...
I don't even know you.

21:49.081 --> 21:54.621
Why would I let you take my kid on some
trip, let alone enrol him anywhere, huh?

21:56.338 --> 21:57.998
I see.

21:58.132 --> 22:01.465
Well, in this case,
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

22:02.053 --> 22:04.092
Goodbye, Fred.

22:04.221 --> 22:08.349
You may keep this calendar
since I won't be seeing you again.

22:08.476 --> 22:12.556
That way, you can look at
Sunflowers any time you want.

22:17.276 --> 22:19.648
Come on, kid.

22:41.050 --> 22:43.422
Jesus, Fred!
What do you think you're doin'?

22:43.552 --> 22:47.550
- I was just...
- You were just gonna walk into the street!

22:47.681 --> 22:50.801
You know better than that.
You always look first.

22:58.609 --> 23:03.769
Who can tell me how many of
these numbers are divisible by two?

23:07.034 --> 23:09.276
Anybody?

23:11.038 --> 23:14.205
- Fred!
- Hm?

23:14.709 --> 23:20.829
I know that you can tell me how many
of these numbers are divisible by two.

23:21.882 --> 23:23.922
Um... All of 'em.

23:30.057 --> 23:32.014
Hey, check it out.

23:32.143 --> 23:34.847
I thought we could make
our own invitations, huh?

23:34.979 --> 23:38.893
- Invitations for what?
- For your birthday party.

23:40.109 --> 23:44.818
Why don't we just go to McDonald's
like we did last year? That was fun.

23:44.947 --> 23:49.111
Oh, yeah? Fun for whom?
You threw up all over me, remember?

23:49.243 --> 23:53.075
I had to burn my favourite shirt
cos of you. Stinky!

23:53.956 --> 23:58.452
- The mail's here.
- Let's see if your chain letter paid off.

23:58.586 --> 24:01.752
What have you got?
The phone bill, gas bill, water bill.

24:01.881 --> 24:03.838
- Throw this one away.
- How come?

24:03.966 --> 24:07.335
We left 'em a deposit.
They can just take it out of that.

24:07.470 --> 24:09.961
Fair enough.

24:12.683 --> 24:15.518
So, what do you want
for your birthday this year?

24:15.644 --> 24:17.684
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

24:17.813 --> 24:19.605
Oops.

24:19.732 --> 24:24.524
How about one of those Lego things?
Hey, what's the matter with the toaster?

24:24.653 --> 24:26.942
Nothing. I was fixing it.

24:27.073 --> 24:29.694
Fixing means to repair
something that is broken.

24:29.825 --> 24:33.444
Not to break something
that works just fine the way it is.

24:35.039 --> 24:38.989
Every little kid should
have a birthday party. It's fun, you'll see.

24:39.126 --> 24:44.832
We'll get some hot dogs. Ice cream and
cake. Pin the tail on the donkey, huh?

24:48.761 --> 24:51.881
It's next Saturday
at 12 o'clock at my apartment.

24:59.063 --> 25:01.388
Give me that. Hey!

25:01.524 --> 25:03.563
Come on, guys!

25:12.660 --> 25:16.954
Scores of gifted youngsters
have been hailed as geniuses.

25:17.081 --> 25:23.036
Many gifted children go through
some period of existential depression.

25:23.170 --> 25:26.539
Pain of the mind can often
be worse than pain of the body.

25:26.674 --> 25:30.422
There is some ground for belief
that genius is touched with madness.

25:31.804 --> 25:35.718
No! Dede! Dede! Dede!

25:36.267 --> 25:39.137
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Ssh.

25:40.855 --> 25:42.598
It's OK.

25:42.732 --> 25:45.020
Did you wake up in another painting?

25:47.570 --> 25:50.689
- Cortin.
- Cortin, huh?

25:51.323 --> 25:53.150
Hm.

25:53.284 --> 25:55.905
I don't really know his work. Cortin?

25:56.662 --> 25:59.912
It's a secretion
that comes from some gland.

26:00.041 --> 26:02.662
I forget which one.

26:02.793 --> 26:05.878
It can turn a little kid into an old man,
Dede.

26:06.922 --> 26:10.754
Oh, yeah? You don't seem
to be secreting anything now.

26:12.636 --> 26:15.306
I tell you what, though.

26:15.431 --> 26:17.554
Tomorrow, after your birthday...

26:17.683 --> 26:20.601
...we'll go to the library
and we'll look it up, OK?

26:20.728 --> 26:23.349
What about work?

26:23.481 --> 26:26.054
Don't worry about work.

26:26.192 --> 26:30.059
All right? Try and get some sleep.
You ain't been sleepin' enough lately.

26:30.196 --> 26:33.529
- I can't.
- You can't, huh?

26:34.450 --> 26:38.033
- You wanna do shadows?
- OK.

26:38.871 --> 26:41.540
All right, we'll do shadows here.

26:41.665 --> 26:43.623
All right.

26:43.751 --> 26:46.503
Mm. How about that one right up there?

26:46.629 --> 26:49.084
It's kinda pointy, see that one?

26:50.091 --> 26:52.629
A man and a boy in a clipper ship.

26:54.512 --> 26:59.008
Yeah. How about that one next to it
with the little round circle on the side?

27:00.142 --> 27:02.764
A whale on fire.

27:02.895 --> 27:06.644
Let's try the other side now.
See right there in the corner?

27:06.774 --> 27:09.063
Kind of round things all on the side?

27:09.485 --> 27:11.941
Got three little points. What's that?

27:13.447 --> 27:16.152
I don't want a birthday party, Dede.

27:17.535 --> 27:22.446
Course you do.
Every little kid wants a birthday party.

28:10.212 --> 28:14.257
- Hello.
- Uh... Jane Grierson, please.

28:14.383 --> 28:16.292
Speaking.

28:16.427 --> 28:19.547
Hi. This is Dede Tate. I'm Fred's mom.

28:20.473 --> 28:22.465
Yes.

28:22.600 --> 28:24.308
Yeah. I was just, uh...

28:24.435 --> 28:27.685
I was wonderin', you know
that trip you were talking about?

28:27.813 --> 28:30.139
Yes. What about it?

28:30.274 --> 28:32.943
Well, it's just for a couple of weeks, right?

28:33.069 --> 28:36.901
Ms Tate, I'm sorry
but I've already selected my students.

28:37.448 --> 28:42.240
Look, um... I don't know how much you
know about Fred, but the kid is amazing.

28:42.370 --> 28:45.157
He writes, he paints, he does everything.

28:45.289 --> 28:49.998
You should see this painting
he made for me. It's like, incredible, so...

28:50.753 --> 28:55.249
Just a minute here. Why are you
suddenly changing your mind? Hm?

28:57.176 --> 28:59.050
Excuse me?

28:59.178 --> 29:01.716
I don't mean to pry but, um...

29:03.432 --> 29:08.427
...do you need time alone or have you
made plans that don't include your son?

29:08.562 --> 29:13.224
Look, lady. You wanna make me
work for it, that's fine, OK?

29:13.359 --> 29:16.276
But we both know that
Fred's a hundred times smarter...

29:16.404 --> 29:18.776
...than the plateheads
you got at that school.

29:18.906 --> 29:21.231
Now, you want him or not?

29:23.452 --> 29:25.528
Does he have a suitcase?

29:57.778 --> 30:02.405
Of course, every parent would like
to think of their child as gifted.

30:02.575 --> 30:04.532
Yldidnelps!

30:04.660 --> 30:06.902
- Stop it.
- Tipots!

30:07.788 --> 30:10.458
Jane, he's talking backwards again.

30:12.209 --> 30:15.661
I got some kinda hellacious
booger hangin' out of my nose?

30:15.796 --> 30:18.370
What are you staring at?

30:18.507 --> 30:20.464
You're the mathemagician.

30:20.593 --> 30:24.804
Want an autograph? Go scrounge a pen,
I'll sign your forehead.

30:26.015 --> 30:29.016
Hey, Damon.
How about a game of magic digit?

30:29.268 --> 30:31.593
Check out this magic digit, Garth.

30:32.480 --> 30:36.857
Now, Damon. You're being hostile.
We agreed that you would work on that.

30:37.318 --> 30:40.651
Scusez-moi, Janey-poo.
I've been working on a problem all day.

30:40.780 --> 30:43.531
I haven't slept in a week
cos of that frog nightmare.

30:43.657 --> 30:46.742
And I'm hungry.
I get pissed off when I'm hungry.

30:48.662 --> 30:51.118
Here. Have a fig newton.

31:18.109 --> 31:22.189
Well, it's official, Garth.
You've misnavigated and now we're lost.

31:22.321 --> 31:24.361
Yeah!

31:26.992 --> 31:31.489
Sir, uh... perhaps you would take
a few moments and show the children...

31:31.622 --> 31:33.994
...how an internal
combustion engine works.

31:44.593 --> 31:48.508
It's said that the genius
learns without study...

31:48.639 --> 31:51.047
...and knows without learning.

31:51.183 --> 31:53.721
That he is eloquent without preparation...

31:53.853 --> 31:59.191
...exact without calculation
and profound without reflection.

31:59.316 --> 32:02.816
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and giris...

32:02.945 --> 32:08.152
...it is a great pleasure to welcome you all
to the 13th annual "Odyssey of the Mind".

32:16.584 --> 32:20.747
Now, you have been
captured by Polyphemus...

32:20.921 --> 32:26.545
...and you have 60 seconds
to write or draw graffiti...

32:26.677 --> 32:29.429
...pertaining to your situation. Go!

32:41.776 --> 32:43.899
Oh, little boy. Don't touch that.

32:44.695 --> 32:48.693
OK, now you have
four minutes to complete your bridge.

32:52.161 --> 32:56.241
Today Goldilocks is on trial.
The charge is breaking and entering.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.699
We're ready for opening remarks.

32:59.335 --> 33:04.709
Just because I'm tired
and hungry and blonde...

33:04.840 --> 33:09.835
...it doesn't mean I can waltz on private
property and make myself at home.

33:09.970 --> 33:14.929
Now, our crybaby defence may like to
turn this into an issue on homelessness...

33:15.059 --> 33:18.060
...but we can't forget the law,
and the law states...

33:18.187 --> 33:25.020
...book three, paragraph 535875, that
what Goldilocks did was against the law.

33:35.246 --> 33:36.574
Well.

33:36.706 --> 33:40.205
It's certainly much quieter out here,
isn't it?

33:40.334 --> 33:42.790
Do you mind if I sit down?

33:54.140 --> 33:56.049
Fred?

34:04.316 --> 34:07.768
This is beautiful.
Why don't we go show the others?

34:12.449 --> 34:14.905
Nobody's gonna laugh at you.

34:16.579 --> 34:18.702
I'm not gonna let them.

34:28.507 --> 34:32.126
All right, let's begin
with another round of questions.

34:33.846 --> 34:37.262
How many minutes are there in 48 years?

34:37.433 --> 34:40.636
25,228,800 minutes.

34:42.103 --> 34:45.722
151,368,000 seconds.

34:45.858 --> 34:48.942
That's very good. Ready for another one?

34:49.070 --> 34:51.358
How many factors are there of 3,067?

34:52.907 --> 34:54.614
Come on, guys!

34:54.742 --> 34:58.609
There are no factors of 3,067!
The number's prime.

34:58.746 --> 35:02.162
Yeah. Another correct answer
from Damon Wells.

35:02.917 --> 35:06.961
Somebody, for God's sake, challenge me!

35:07.421 --> 35:09.330
OK.

35:09.465 --> 35:14.210
How about giving me a number that,
when divided by the product of its digits...

35:14.345 --> 35:18.971
...the quotient is three, and if
you were to add 18 to this number...

35:19.100 --> 35:21.139
...the digits would be inverted?

35:28.109 --> 35:31.608
24. 24. 24.

35:31.737 --> 35:33.979
24.

35:34.740 --> 35:38.405
- That is correct.
- What's right? I didn't say anything.

35:38.536 --> 35:44.076
- You said 24.
- No, I didn't. I mean, I would have, but...

35:57.680 --> 36:00.515
Open your mouth like that again,
I'll put my foot in it.

36:00.641 --> 36:04.342
- It was an accident!
- I don't give a damn. Don't do it again.

36:04.478 --> 36:07.645
Damon! Damon, what are you doing?

36:07.940 --> 36:09.980
Fred and I were having a little chat.

36:10.109 --> 36:12.730
I wouldn't call ripping
his hair out "chatting".

36:12.862 --> 36:15.531
I was rollin' till the little quark stepped in.

36:15.656 --> 36:19.239
Damon, now contrary
to what you might think...

36:19.368 --> 36:22.405
...this is not Caesars Palace
and you are not Wayne Newton.

36:22.538 --> 36:28.042
And you're not Freud, so why don't you
just give it a rest. Get a life, will ya?

36:28.169 --> 36:32.961
Hey, don't cry, lepton. You can do
the math tomorrow. I was bored anyway.

36:35.217 --> 36:37.257
Shotgun!

36:41.766 --> 36:44.636
Fred. Fred, are you all right?

36:46.604 --> 36:48.596
Why is he so mean to you?

36:56.322 --> 36:59.525
- 1,008.
- That's correct.

37:01.911 --> 37:07.332
Fred, what's the cube root of 3,796,466?

37:08.376 --> 37:10.333
156.

37:10.461 --> 37:12.500
Correct.

37:14.965 --> 37:17.801
What number has
the following peculiarity?

37:17.968 --> 37:21.053
That if its cube were added
to five times its square...

37:21.180 --> 37:26.091
...and from the result 42 times
the number and 40 is subtracted...

37:26.227 --> 37:28.266
...the remainder is nothing.

37:29.063 --> 37:30.937
Five.

37:31.065 --> 37:33.104
Correct.

37:43.202 --> 37:46.488
- You can see all the way to Neptune.
- Wow.

37:46.622 --> 37:49.623
- The telescope moves all by itself.
- Yeah?

37:49.750 --> 37:52.206
Just like the earth does.

37:52.920 --> 37:55.126
- And you know what else?
- What?

37:55.256 --> 38:00.297
- On Friday, we're going to Jane's ranch.
- It sounds like you're having lots of fun.

38:01.595 --> 38:04.846
Miss you, though. Miss you big.

38:05.474 --> 38:07.597
- Me too.
- Go back to sleep.

38:07.727 --> 38:10.348
- OK. Night, Dede.
- Good night.

38:11.689 --> 38:14.476
I won't eat it!

38:14.608 --> 38:16.850
What are you looking at, lepton?

38:24.535 --> 38:26.113
Jane!

38:26.245 --> 38:28.285
All right, now who has a song?

38:29.582 --> 38:35.169
When I was a girl, we used to sing
Liebeslieder Walzer on our car trips. Hm?

38:35.296 --> 38:37.372
"Nein, es ist nicht."

38:37.506 --> 38:40.591
Nein, es ist nicht
auszukommen mit den Leuten

38:41.510 --> 38:44.180
Alles wissen sie so giftig auszudeuten

38:45.556 --> 38:48.640
Nein, es ist nicht
auszukommen mit den Leuten

38:49.477 --> 38:52.643
Alles wissen sie so giftig auszudeuten

38:53.522 --> 38:56.726
Nein, es ist nicht
auszukommen mit den Leuten

38:57.568 --> 39:01.981
Alles wissen sie so giftig auszudeuten

39:03.115 --> 39:06.864
My great-great-grandparents built
this house after the Civil War.

39:06.994 --> 39:11.158
Now, who can tell me
what style of architecture this is?

39:11.290 --> 39:13.959
Is this Shaker or neoclassical?

39:15.169 --> 39:17.625
Wait for me!

39:45.116 --> 39:48.401
Edward Soloman Joins "Live Wire"
tomorrow to answer that...

39:48.536 --> 39:54.040
...and to talk about his current best seller
"Family of One: Today's Career Woman".

39:55.668 --> 39:58.123
I just wanted to put this back.

40:02.425 --> 40:07.003
Tell me, Fred. Why won't your mother
let you take any more tests?

40:09.765 --> 40:15.270
That's wrong of her. You must tell her that
your intelligence is nothing to hide from.

40:22.153 --> 40:24.644
- Are these your parents?
- Mm-hm.

40:26.032 --> 40:29.483
- This is your father?
- Mm-hm.

40:29.618 --> 40:31.658
Yes.

40:32.413 --> 40:35.034
Yes, he was a terrific music-Iover.

40:37.376 --> 40:40.876
In fact, when I was your age
I used to play the violin.

40:41.797 --> 40:44.288
How come you don't play now?

40:44.425 --> 40:49.550
Well, we decided that I would be
happier pursuing my academic career.

40:51.515 --> 40:53.804
How come you're not
in any of these pictures?

40:53.934 --> 40:56.722
Oh, I'm sure I'm in some of them.

40:56.854 --> 40:59.310
No, you're not.

41:01.567 --> 41:03.061
Well.

41:08.741 --> 41:11.944
Both my parents were very busy people.

41:12.078 --> 41:14.485
They were both physicians.

41:14.622 --> 41:18.951
They both lectured a lot, travelled a lot.

41:19.085 --> 41:21.836
Sometimes they just needed to be alone.

41:23.839 --> 41:27.089
If they travelled a lot, they were alone.

41:28.886 --> 41:30.926
Mm-hm.

41:31.680 --> 41:34.136
Well... it's time for bed.

41:43.526 --> 41:45.814
Good night, Fred.

42:24.358 --> 42:26.896
Bleuh!

42:34.493 --> 42:36.533
Damon?

42:44.754 --> 42:47.327
- What are you doing?
- I'm waxing my Buick.

42:47.465 --> 42:52.008
- What the hell does it look like I'm doing?
- What are you so mad at?

42:52.136 --> 42:56.181
I noticed you and Jane are getting
to be as close as a couple of fingers.

42:56.307 --> 43:01.514
I bet back in the slum you got friends
up the ying-yang. Am I right or am I right?

43:01.645 --> 43:05.180
No. I don't have any friends at home.

43:06.067 --> 43:07.477
Oh.

43:07.610 --> 43:11.773
Well, then boohoo, Fred.
I'm all busted up inside.

43:13.866 --> 43:16.024
What about you?

43:16.160 --> 43:18.236
Come on. Wake up and face north, twink.

43:18.371 --> 43:20.908
I'm an asshole.
Assholes don't have friends.

43:21.040 --> 43:23.495
But then, I don't really care.

43:24.752 --> 43:28.417
- You don't?
- The reasonable man adapts to the worid.

43:28.547 --> 43:31.465
The unreasonable man expects
the worid to adapt to him.

43:31.592 --> 43:34.261
Therefore all progress is made
by unreasonable men.

43:34.387 --> 43:37.222
- Jane say that?
- It was George Bernard Shaw.

43:39.558 --> 43:42.263
- Like to ride horses?
- I dunno how.

43:42.770 --> 43:45.724
Well, then, today's your lucky day.

43:52.697 --> 43:57.193
When I was a kid, the guy'd grab me
by the neck and shake me and say...

43:57.326 --> 44:00.909
..."So, shithead, you think
you're smarter than your old man?"

44:01.288 --> 44:03.328
Well, were you?

44:04.250 --> 44:06.456
I'm smarter than everybody...

44:06.585 --> 44:08.495
...except Jane.

44:10.339 --> 44:12.379
I dunno. Guys like me...

44:12.508 --> 44:15.379
...and maybe you, we're different.

44:15.511 --> 44:17.634
I mean, I hate to admit it, but...

44:17.763 --> 44:21.049
...without Jane I'd be just
another creep in a cape.

44:22.685 --> 44:26.932
The only drag is listening to her give
those same stupid lectures over and over.

44:27.064 --> 44:30.979
- If it weren't for the game, I'd go crazy.
- The game?

44:31.652 --> 44:36.812
Yeah. Sometimes, instead of listening
to her, I just count the words she says.

44:38.075 --> 44:43.033
Actually, I count everything.
Buildings. Dance steps.

44:43.164 --> 44:46.034
Airspace. Trees.

44:47.585 --> 44:49.624
Wow.

45:10.733 --> 45:14.268
See, Fred. It's not the size
of a guy's IQ that matters.

45:15.821 --> 45:17.778
It's how he uses it.

45:18.616 --> 45:21.533
I like you, Damon.

45:21.660 --> 45:23.819
Come on. I'll race you back.

46:01.283 --> 46:03.323
Damon?

46:04.328 --> 46:05.526
Damon!

46:05.996 --> 46:08.452
Damon.

46:09.375 --> 46:12.210
Damon, how many fingers?

46:13.796 --> 46:17.379
- Orange.
- You'll be fine.

46:42.742 --> 46:46.360
Here's your jacket. Bye-bye, Fred.
I hope I see you soon.

46:46.996 --> 46:49.950
- Bye, Fred.
- Bye, Fred.

46:51.042 --> 46:53.081
See ya around.

46:56.714 --> 46:58.753
Fred.

47:00.801 --> 47:02.841
Let me take these, OK?

47:07.600 --> 47:10.803
Let's go.
I'm gonna make your favourite dinner.

47:10.936 --> 47:12.976
French toast and fried apples.

47:24.909 --> 47:26.948
Hey, ta-da!

47:29.789 --> 47:32.992
Money's been kinda tight lately, but...

47:33.125 --> 47:36.826
...I'll think of somethin'.
Don't worry about it, OK, kid?

47:44.595 --> 47:48.759
You didn't paint the right number
of keys on here, lepton.

47:49.392 --> 47:52.926
I ran outta paint. What'd you just call me?

47:54.355 --> 47:56.928
- Lepton.
- What the hell's that?

47:57.900 --> 48:01.980
- You wouldn't understand.
- Whoa, wait a minute. Speak slowly then.

48:02.113 --> 48:03.690
OK.

48:03.823 --> 48:07.655
- A lepton is a Z particle.
- So?

48:07.868 --> 48:10.573
Do you know what
protons and electrons are?

48:11.080 --> 48:12.491
Yeah.

48:12.832 --> 48:15.619
OK. What are they?

48:19.422 --> 48:24.463
They're those, uh... those teeny,
tiny things that atoms are made out of.

48:24.719 --> 48:27.007
Well, leptons are even smaller.

48:30.933 --> 48:35.145
So have you looked for a new job yet?

48:40.192 --> 48:42.268
- Hello.
- Hello, is Derf there?

48:42.403 --> 48:46.353
- Derf? You got the wrong number.
- Wait! That's Bob Yee.

48:47.575 --> 48:50.695
- Hi, Bob. What are you doin'?
- Guess what?

48:50.828 --> 48:55.075
- I got that Job at TRW this morning.
- Really? Wow.

48:55.207 --> 48:57.200
So what are you doin', huh?

48:57.334 --> 48:59.742
Uh, nothing. Just sitting around.

48:59.879 --> 49:03.164
Do you think Damon'll be OK?
For a second, I thought he was dead.

49:03.299 --> 49:06.750
I thought he was dead, too,
but Jane says it's just a concussion.

49:06.886 --> 49:08.925
Jane knows CPR.

49:10.848 --> 49:12.971
She did? I didn't know that?

49:13.100 --> 49:15.935
She told me she was
gonna teach me sometime.

49:16.062 --> 49:19.347
Did you know Jane speaks
five different languages?

49:26.489 --> 49:29.406
"Clipper Ships" by Matt Montini.

49:29.533 --> 49:32.071
"Me and my dad make
models of clipper ships."

49:32.203 --> 49:34.907
"I like clipper ships
because they are fast."

49:35.039 --> 49:37.494
"Clipper ships sail the ocean."

49:37.625 --> 49:40.330
"Clipper ships never sail
on rivers or lakes."

49:40.461 --> 49:44.209
"Clipper ships have lots of sails
and are made out of wood."

49:45.299 --> 49:48.335
Thank you, Matt. That was very nice.

49:48.469 --> 49:50.925
OK. Who's next?

49:55.976 --> 49:58.598
I want to write a book about Fred...

49:58.729 --> 50:01.137
...about his formative experiences.

50:02.608 --> 50:05.229
His life story, if you will.

50:05.486 --> 50:09.151
Well... Gonna be a short book.

50:09.740 --> 50:14.070
Ms Tate, over the years, I've met
many math and music prodigies...

50:14.203 --> 50:18.201
...but never one with
Fred's kind of intuition...

50:18.332 --> 50:21.037
...his, uh...

50:21.168 --> 50:25.000
...his kind of, um, sensitivity.

50:26.173 --> 50:30.171
This summer, I've been asked
to teach a class at Fieldhurst...

50:30.302 --> 50:33.588
...and I'd like to use that time
to really observe Fred.

50:34.306 --> 50:38.803
He would take a class and, in return,
I would waive his tuition at the Institute...

50:38.978 --> 50:42.513
...for as long as he attends.

50:44.483 --> 50:46.523
Wait. Wait a minute.

50:48.029 --> 50:51.563
- You wanna take Fred to college?
- Just for the summer.

50:53.117 --> 50:56.403
Why can't you just wait and,
like, observe him in the fall?

50:56.829 --> 51:00.163
I wouldn't have time.
I'd be busy running the Institute.

51:00.291 --> 51:02.829
Well. As it happens, we already got plans.

51:03.669 --> 51:07.667
Me and a friend got good jobs dancing
at this hotel in Orlando for the summer.

51:07.798 --> 51:11.084
The place is really nice.
It's got a big pool and everything.

51:12.386 --> 51:16.004
- A pool?
- Yeah, so that's that.

51:16.182 --> 51:18.803
Ms Tate, Fred is not a leper.

51:18.934 --> 51:22.718
Intelligence is not a disease
that you have to protect him from.

51:22.855 --> 51:25.690
He's blessed, but he's certainly not alone.

51:25.816 --> 51:27.975
There are many gifted children out there.

51:28.110 --> 51:32.819
Yeah? How many of 'em
are blessed with ulcers, huh?

51:33.574 --> 51:38.616
How many of them go to bed worrying
about the ozone layer, the rain forest...

51:38.746 --> 51:42.411
...and why innocent people
get murdered all the time?

51:42.541 --> 51:45.495
Fred worries about everything.
He can't help himself.

51:45.628 --> 51:49.328
You wanna send him to college. Jesus.

51:49.465 --> 51:52.003
You hear about kids
ten years older than him...

51:52.134 --> 51:54.969
...jumping outta windows
on account of the pressure.

51:55.179 --> 51:59.473
Let's not get hysterical. We're talking
about one class for one summer.

52:00.267 --> 52:02.593
I told you. We already made plans.

52:03.354 --> 52:05.761
What I'm trying to tell you is that...

52:05.898 --> 52:11.604
...your son is starving for stimulation and
challenge, and for some order in his life.

52:11.737 --> 52:14.359
Things that you don't provide
but that I will.

52:15.366 --> 52:19.494
I know that to deny a child's potential
is to smother his true self.

52:19.620 --> 52:22.028
Fred doesn't give a shit
about his potential.

52:22.164 --> 52:25.035
He just wants to be a normal,
happy little kid.

52:25.418 --> 52:30.126
Well, he's not normal, thank God,
and he's certainly not happy.

52:30.464 --> 52:32.504
And you underestimate him greatly...

52:32.633 --> 52:36.797
...if you think that a summer by the pool
will ever be enough for him.

52:36.929 --> 52:39.467
Fred wants to go to college.

52:39.598 --> 52:42.303
Don't take my word for it. Ask him.

53:00.578 --> 53:03.781
Hey. What are you doin'?

53:03.914 --> 53:06.370
Your résumé.

53:09.336 --> 53:11.376
Oh.

53:12.798 --> 53:16.713
So, I understand that you and Jane
made some plans, huh?

53:20.014 --> 53:24.475
So, were you just gonna sneak off
to college without saying anything?

53:26.395 --> 53:29.100
Fred, do you wanna go to college?

53:30.483 --> 53:32.938
You know, Jane says you do.

53:36.822 --> 53:39.657
It sure sounds great to me.

53:39.784 --> 53:42.571
Sounds like a great opportunity.

53:43.871 --> 53:46.991
I mean, you hang round here
for too long and you might, uh...

53:47.124 --> 53:50.458
...you might smother
your potential or somethin'.

53:50.586 --> 53:53.291
I'd sure feel real lousy if that happened.

53:56.092 --> 53:59.626
Course, you know you're
gonna have to live with her.

54:01.013 --> 54:05.058
Which means you'd also miss out
on a real summer vacation.

54:06.894 --> 54:08.934
Hey.

54:10.398 --> 54:13.233
You wanna go to college
or you wanna go to Disney Worid?

54:13.359 --> 54:17.570
I've already been to Disney Worid.
I went with Jane, remember?

54:21.617 --> 54:23.361
Frère Jacques, frère Jacques

54:23.494 --> 54:26.411
Doomay boo, doomay boo

54:26.914 --> 54:30.117
Soma loma neema, soma loma neema

54:30.251 --> 54:33.584
Dim dam dong, dim dam dong

54:33.754 --> 54:35.996
Frère Jacques...

54:36.132 --> 54:38.290
You look crabby.

54:38.426 --> 54:40.383
I'm not crabby.

54:40.511 --> 54:42.967
I'm pensive.

54:58.320 --> 55:02.318
This'll take a couple of minutes,
so why don't you just go park the car?

55:02.450 --> 55:04.526
- Hi, Jane.
- Wait, wait.

55:04.702 --> 55:08.285
Just a minute, Fred. OK, now!

55:08.581 --> 55:10.620
- Hi, Jane.
- Hi, Fred.

55:14.712 --> 55:16.751
Wow.

55:51.040 --> 55:55.334
- You need a belt, kid.
- No, I don't. I just need to tuck in my shirt.

55:56.212 --> 55:58.750
You need a belt.

55:58.881 --> 56:04.717
Hey, how about if we just say
"See ya tomorrow" instead of "goodbye"?

56:05.346 --> 56:08.797
If you send me the chequebook,
I'll balance it for you.

56:09.642 --> 56:12.133
I think I can take care of that, Freddie.

56:13.854 --> 56:16.180
Who's gonna water the plants?

56:16.315 --> 56:20.360
Hey, forget about the plants, OK?

56:20.486 --> 56:22.728
Forget about the chequebook.

56:22.863 --> 56:25.319
You're gonna have a great time.

56:27.368 --> 56:30.037
So are you.

56:30.162 --> 56:33.033
Every day that I know you, I...

56:34.083 --> 56:37.499
I admire you a little bit more every day.

56:37.628 --> 56:40.463
Every day I say to myself...

56:40.589 --> 56:44.504
...this little kid is exactly
the kind of person I wanna be.

56:45.678 --> 56:47.884
I mean, let's face it.

56:48.013 --> 56:51.429
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

56:52.518 --> 56:55.270
So don't worry so much. OK?

57:07.158 --> 57:09.779
Hey, love you big.

57:09.910 --> 57:11.950
Go get your bag.

57:18.419 --> 57:20.827
Dede, I know this must be difficult for you.

57:21.922 --> 57:24.496
You might wanna keep
an extra telephone around.

57:24.633 --> 57:28.252
- Excuse me?
- He likes to take 'em apart, you know.

57:28.512 --> 57:32.012
Sometimes, uh... sometimes...

57:32.975 --> 57:35.644
I understand.

57:36.979 --> 57:39.517
Listen to me, Jane.

57:39.648 --> 57:43.729
If anything happens to him,
anything at all...

57:43.861 --> 57:46.269
...I'll kill you.

57:46.405 --> 57:48.979
Now, I don't mean that I'll just hurt you.

57:49.116 --> 57:51.821
I mean that I'll kill you.

57:57.208 --> 58:03.044
Hey. Give you a call from Orlando, OK?
Hear all about your first day.

58:04.840 --> 58:06.418
Bye, sweetie.

58:06.550 --> 58:08.590
Hands on noses, guys.

58:14.725 --> 58:16.303
See you tomorrow.

58:16.852 --> 58:18.892
See you tomorrow.

58:20.064 --> 58:22.103
Just go.

58:24.735 --> 58:26.775
Bye, Fred.

58:36.872 --> 58:41.369
Now, Fred.
These chores are your responsibilities.

58:41.961 --> 58:44.499
And for every week
that you do them correctly...

58:44.630 --> 58:50.135
...we'll do something fun like go to the
symphony, or rent a nice documentary.

58:50.302 --> 58:53.339
These are soup bowls. These are not.

58:53.472 --> 58:57.256
These are my glasses
and these are your glasses.

58:57.393 --> 58:59.848
These are your pens and your pencils.

58:59.979 --> 59:04.605
And, Fred,
these are my pens and my pencils.

59:09.697 --> 59:11.606
It's not your mother's fault.

59:11.741 --> 59:15.573
Most parents are ignorant
to the benefits of macrobiotics.

59:18.080 --> 59:20.785
If your mother had put you
on a diet like this sooner...

59:20.916 --> 59:23.407
...you might never have gotten an ulcer.

59:25.046 --> 59:28.379
- Can I have a Coke?
- Absolutely not.

59:48.569 --> 59:52.068
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

59:53.616 --> 59:56.700
Everything that comes
from the body is natural.

59:58.245 --> 01:00:02.243
- Now can I have a Coke?
- In the fridge.

01:00:26.816 --> 01:00:31.561
Fred, I'll meet you outside
on the steps right after class.

01:00:31.696 --> 01:00:33.735
- All right?
- Mm.

01:00:35.783 --> 01:00:37.822
Good luck.

01:00:54.635 --> 01:00:57.209
Come on. Let's sit you down in the front.

01:00:59.682 --> 01:01:02.434
Would you mind sitting over there,
please?

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:14.809
All right.
Let's all calm down and shut up...

01:01:14.947 --> 01:01:17.901
...so we can start getting
Dad's money's worth.

01:01:18.034 --> 01:01:21.284
Now, for those of you who may be lost...

01:01:22.246 --> 01:01:25.532
...the name of this class is Phys 105.

01:01:25.666 --> 01:01:30.209
Quantum physics. Not physical education.

01:01:40.306 --> 01:01:43.260
All right. Everybody in the right place?

01:01:44.727 --> 01:01:46.766
Goddamn college kids.

01:01:46.896 --> 01:01:48.010
Morning.

01:01:48.147 --> 01:01:52.892
Used to be young people respected other
people's property. You could trust 'em.

01:01:53.027 --> 01:01:57.238
Now, they come down here
on vacation and they trash the place.

01:01:57.365 --> 01:02:00.650
What do they care?
It's not their house. Damn brats.

01:02:01.285 --> 01:02:05.912
Then on top of that I got five
undercover ABC guys circulating.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.875
- The network?
- Alcoholic Beverage Control, Gina.

01:02:09.001 --> 01:02:12.750
Half my clientele on this
particular evening is underage.

01:02:13.506 --> 01:02:15.545
How am I supposed to know this?

01:02:15.674 --> 01:02:20.502
Anyway...
my liquor licence is now toilet paper.

01:02:20.638 --> 01:02:24.221
Wait a second.
You sayin' you're not gonna do the show?

01:02:24.350 --> 01:02:27.220
Don't tell me we came
all the way down here for nothin'.

01:02:27.353 --> 01:02:29.392
Oh, boy.

01:02:30.022 --> 01:02:32.145
You two got any waitressing experience?

01:02:32.316 --> 01:02:35.270
- Come on!
- Don't dive in the shallow end!

01:02:35.695 --> 01:02:38.814
- At least they got water in the pool.
- I could murder you.

01:02:38.948 --> 01:02:42.233
- He said it's temporary.
- He said his lawyers were working on it.

01:02:42.368 --> 01:02:44.325
We can still make a vacation of it.

01:02:44.453 --> 01:02:46.861
When life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade.

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:50.413
Hey, this ain't lemons, Gina.
This is dog shit.

01:02:50.543 --> 01:02:54.623
I mean, if I wanted to wait tables,
I coulda stayed in the city.

01:03:03.389 --> 01:03:05.512
Did you lose your mommy, sweetie?

01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:11.896
Yo, kid! A little help with the Frisbee, huh?

01:03:15.818 --> 01:03:18.605
- Whoa! Watch it, kid.
- Sorry.

01:03:21.449 --> 01:03:23.690
I have 40. Do I hear 50?

01:03:24.577 --> 01:03:25.573
50.

01:03:25.703 --> 01:03:29.072
I have 50. Now, come on, people.
Do I hear 60?

01:03:30.249 --> 01:03:34.377
- 60!
- I have 60. Do I hear 70?

01:03:36.422 --> 01:03:38.664
- Come on, people. This is for charity.
- 70.

01:03:38.799 --> 01:03:40.626
- Did I hear 70?
- 1,000!

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.001
All right, I have 70. Do I hear 80?

01:03:43.137 --> 01:03:46.387
I said 1,000 you racist frat-head.

01:03:47.475 --> 01:03:49.384
Come on, mister. This is for charity.

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:52.596
What charity's that?
The Inter-Geek Recreation Center?

01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:56.181
That should change a few lives.
Get outta my face, you jughead.

01:03:59.403 --> 01:04:01.443
Hey, wait a minute.

01:04:03.699 --> 01:04:05.906
Heads!

01:04:17.963 --> 01:04:20.003
Excuse me, fellas.

01:04:20.716 --> 01:04:22.756
It's a little boy.

01:04:24.637 --> 01:04:27.638
- Eddie, you killed him.
- I wasn't even aimin' for him.

01:04:27.765 --> 01:04:30.600
- Besides, what's a kid doin' out here?
- He's not a kid!

01:04:30.726 --> 01:04:32.968
Get away from him.

01:04:34.522 --> 01:04:36.810
Oh, God. Not again.

01:04:36.941 --> 01:04:39.479
Fred! Fred?

01:04:40.236 --> 01:04:42.275
Oh, Fred.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:47.360
- This is called a sphygmomanometer.
- It is?

01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:57.042
- Hello.
- Hey, Jane. Let me talk to Fred.

01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:59.993
Dede. How are you?

01:05:00.256 --> 01:05:02.581
Just peachy. Now where's Fred, huh?

01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:05.424
- How many fingers?
- Two.

01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:08.470
- He can't talk right now.
- How come?

01:05:08.597 --> 01:05:12.263
- He's taking a nap.
- So wake him up.

01:05:12.393 --> 01:05:15.928
- I wanna hear about his first day.
- He's very tired, Dede.

01:05:16.188 --> 01:05:19.142
Cut the shit, Jane.
Put the kid on the goddamn phone.

01:05:21.152 --> 01:05:23.191
Here he is.

01:05:25.239 --> 01:05:29.948
Now, Fred. You don't wanna get
your mother all upset over nothing. Hm?

01:05:30.578 --> 01:05:32.072
OK.

01:05:32.204 --> 01:05:34.244
Hi, Dede.

01:05:34.373 --> 01:05:38.786
Jane was late picking me up
and I got hit on the head with a globe.

01:05:40.129 --> 01:05:41.409
How's Florida?

01:05:44.717 --> 01:05:46.756
Bicycle! Ohh!

01:05:51.432 --> 01:05:56.592
The spin angular momentum
of the beta particle of one half...

01:05:56.729 --> 01:06:03.478
...must be balanced by
a particle having a spin angular...

01:06:32.098 --> 01:06:35.716
That's him.
He looks like a little bookworm.

01:06:36.727 --> 01:06:39.183
He's studying real hard.

01:06:45.194 --> 01:06:47.483
He must be all of ten.

01:06:47.613 --> 01:06:51.563
Yo, Muffy! What the hell you lookin' at?
Get outta here, you punk.

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.412
Hey, how's your head?

01:06:55.538 --> 01:06:57.411
Remember me?

01:06:57.540 --> 01:07:00.494
I'm the guy that took
your lights out the other day.

01:07:01.293 --> 01:07:03.582
Well, look. I brought you a present.

01:07:05.047 --> 01:07:09.460
Ta-da! Remember this? It's got a little
blood on it, right there on El Salvador.

01:07:09.593 --> 01:07:11.716
I think that's pretty cool.

01:07:11.846 --> 01:07:14.301
- It's for you. I brought it for you.
- Thanks.

01:07:14.432 --> 01:07:17.598
You're welcome. My name's Eddie.

01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:20.218
- Fred.
- Nice to meet you, Fred.

01:07:20.354 --> 01:07:23.557
- What's your major?
- What's my major?

01:07:23.691 --> 01:07:26.894
Damn! Who you been hanging out with?

01:07:27.028 --> 01:07:29.565
Jane. What's your major?

01:07:30.448 --> 01:07:34.030
Well, let's see.
Russian Lit. Afro-Am. Poly Sci.

01:07:34.368 --> 01:07:36.657
French. Swahili. Ooglie booglie.

01:07:36.787 --> 01:07:41.829
Toilet trainin'. Eatin' dirt. Nose-pickin'.
One of those. I dunno.

01:07:42.251 --> 01:07:45.418
- So who's Jane? That your girlfriend?
- The lady I live with.

01:07:45.546 --> 01:07:48.215
The lady you live with?

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:50.748
Say, what are you doing this afternoon?

01:07:51.677 --> 01:07:54.085
Just bringing in the mail.

01:08:30.216 --> 01:08:33.002
Ooo-wee! That was swingin'!
Was that swingin' or what?

01:08:33.135 --> 01:08:35.175
We're gonna go on the road together.

01:08:35.304 --> 01:08:38.470
But I can't play the classical stuff.
You have to handle that.

01:08:38.599 --> 01:08:41.719
You know what the funniest thing
about Mozart was? His hair.

01:08:41.852 --> 01:08:44.604
I'd say to Mozart
"That's the ugliest hairdo I've seen".

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:48.265
I think Mozart should have a big Afro
or a Mohawk, or a something.

01:08:48.401 --> 01:08:50.439
Well, Mozart got an Afro

01:08:54.657 --> 01:08:56.696
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Swing along!

01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:59.448
Yeah, man.

01:09:06.544 --> 01:09:08.582
Swing it.

01:09:26.063 --> 01:09:27.890
Well?

01:09:28.774 --> 01:09:30.981
Looks good.

01:09:32.486 --> 01:09:34.812
It's funny, Garth.

01:09:34.947 --> 01:09:39.075
I'm experiencing a whole
new side of me I've never felt before.

01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:42.198
It's just a meat loaf, Jane.

01:09:42.328 --> 01:09:46.161
No. To me, it's a lot more than a meat loaf.
It's a milestone.

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.286
I mean...

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:53.548
...who would have thought
that I'd ever cook anything?

01:09:54.425 --> 01:09:57.212
Maybe you're turning over a new loaf.

01:09:58.888 --> 01:10:02.091
- What do I do about Live Wire?
- Do we have to discuss that now?

01:10:02.433 --> 01:10:05.138
If Buckner wants to do
an hour on gifted children...

01:10:05.394 --> 01:10:08.644
What does Winston Buckner know
about gifted children?

01:10:08.773 --> 01:10:12.936
Why doesn't he do a talk show on
petulant talk show hosts instead?

01:10:14.111 --> 01:10:16.602
Oh! I've gotta make the salad.

01:10:17.073 --> 01:10:20.607
That's why he needs you.
And he wants to bring Fred on, too.

01:10:20.743 --> 01:10:22.985
You could bring
a few examples of his work.

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.658
He'd like that.

01:10:26.415 --> 01:10:28.242
What time is it?

01:10:29.043 --> 01:10:31.332
The object of the game
is to bank the ball...

01:10:31.462 --> 01:10:34.463
...so that you hit the other one
right where the shadow is.

01:10:37.218 --> 01:10:39.839
You wanna try to hit the ball nice and low.

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:42.426
That way you get a lot of backspin on it.

01:10:43.724 --> 01:10:45.847
Pow!

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:48.137
- Like that.
- Hey, Eddie.

01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:52.482
- Hey, where the hell y'all been?
- Anna fainted in the parking lot.

01:10:52.608 --> 01:10:56.226
Say, everybody. This is my son Fred.

01:10:56.362 --> 01:10:59.067
- Fred!
- How ya doin', Fred?

01:10:59.407 --> 01:11:02.407
Hey, kid.
What are you doin' with the worid?

01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:05.281
It was a present.

01:11:20.928 --> 01:11:24.379
Never mind, Officer. He's back.
Yes, just now. Thank you.

01:11:24.515 --> 01:11:27.006
- Fred!
- Sorry I'm late.

01:11:27.143 --> 01:11:29.182
Fred, where have you been?

01:11:30.813 --> 01:11:33.933
Fred, you smell like a brewery!

01:11:34.942 --> 01:11:37.350
And have you been smoking?

01:11:37.486 --> 01:11:41.069
I was in a pool hall.
I'm learning how to play pool!

01:11:41.574 --> 01:11:44.112
- Good game.
- Shut up, Garth.

01:11:45.077 --> 01:11:47.319
Do you know what time it is?

01:11:48.247 --> 01:11:49.789
7.3.

01:11:49.915 --> 01:11:52.371
Do you remember what time
I asked you to be home?

01:11:52.835 --> 01:11:54.792
5...

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.499
Fred, if I tell you to be home at five
o'clock, you're to be home at five o'clock.

01:11:59.717 --> 01:12:01.875
Not six o'clock. Not seven o'clock.

01:12:02.011 --> 01:12:05.676
Not 7.1, not 7.2 and certainly not 7.3.

01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:08.762
I can't eat this.

01:12:08.893 --> 01:12:11.099
No, of course you can't. It's cold.

01:12:12.063 --> 01:12:15.099
No. My stomach.

01:12:15.232 --> 01:12:17.355
Oh, my God, that's right.

01:12:17.485 --> 01:12:22.360
Now, Fred. Let's not whine. There must
be something for you to eat around here.

01:12:22.490 --> 01:12:25.194
- I could go pick something up.
- It's OK.

01:12:25.326 --> 01:12:27.568
I already ate.

01:12:28.245 --> 01:12:31.412
What? You ate without me?

01:12:32.333 --> 01:12:34.658
We could have dessert.

01:12:34.794 --> 01:12:36.917
No. We cannot.

01:12:38.214 --> 01:12:42.626
A rule has been broken.
We don't reward that kind of behaviour.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:45.630
Now, Fred,
I'm sure if we thought about it...

01:12:45.763 --> 01:12:49.547
...we'd decide that pool halls
are no place for someone your age.

01:12:50.851 --> 01:12:54.434
If you want to play something,
come and talk to me.

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:59.358
And, Fred, when I scold you,
it doesn't mean I don't care about you.

01:12:59.485 --> 01:13:02.688
It only means I'm trying
to correct your mistakes.

01:13:04.865 --> 01:13:07.535
Now, how about a nice game of Scrabble?

01:13:08.619 --> 01:13:10.908
And... go.

01:13:15.876 --> 01:13:17.916
Done.

01:13:18.587 --> 01:13:20.829
Isn't this fun?

01:13:20.965 --> 01:13:23.004
Damn it.

01:13:27.596 --> 01:13:30.004
- Fred.
- I'll go get you another phone.

01:13:30.141 --> 01:13:32.180
Fred.

01:13:34.603 --> 01:13:38.222
- Hello?
- Hey! What's up, huh?

01:13:39.108 --> 01:13:43.188
- Nothing. What's up with you?
- I'm gettin' a tan.

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.064
Oh.

01:13:45.197 --> 01:13:48.032
Actually, it's more of a burn.

01:13:48.284 --> 01:13:51.071
- So?
- So?

01:13:52.997 --> 01:13:55.452
So, listen.

01:13:55.583 --> 01:13:58.537
What are you doin' next weekend, huh?

01:13:58.669 --> 01:14:00.247
Huh?

01:14:00.379 --> 01:14:02.870
Come on, it's 4th July.
What are you doin'?

01:14:03.007 --> 01:14:06.542
- How about a barbecue on the beach?
- I'm gonna be on TV.

01:14:09.597 --> 01:14:11.839
Let me speak to her.

01:14:12.683 --> 01:14:15.554
Hi, Dede. It's Jane.

01:14:15.686 --> 01:14:21.392
We were gonna call you. Fred and I have
been invited to appear on "Live Wire".

01:14:22.068 --> 01:14:24.226
Isn't that exciting?

01:14:24.362 --> 01:14:25.986
Uh-huh.

01:14:26.113 --> 01:14:31.108
I thought, if it's OK with you, we'd stay
overnight to see the fireworks in the park.

01:14:31.243 --> 01:14:34.494
Yeah, sure.
Freddie'd love that. He would.

01:14:34.622 --> 01:14:36.745
Great. Don't forget to watch.

01:14:36.874 --> 01:14:40.208
It's Saturday at 12.3. Here's Fred.

01:14:40.336 --> 01:14:44.084
Don't talk too long.
It's costing your mother a fortune.

01:14:44.673 --> 01:14:46.333
Hi.

01:14:46.801 --> 01:14:49.208
Hey. Everything's good, huh?

01:14:49.428 --> 01:14:51.468
Everything's perfect.

01:14:53.307 --> 01:14:56.806
- I'm learning how to play pool.
- Pool?

01:14:57.103 --> 01:14:59.594
Yeah. My friend Eddie's teaching me.

01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:02.020
Wow. Eddie.

01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:06.642
Don't put down too many bets, OK, kiddo?

01:15:08.489 --> 01:15:12.783
Look, I gotta go.
Jane's giving me this test.

01:15:13.703 --> 01:15:16.324
Yeah, OK. I tell you what. Um...

01:15:16.455 --> 01:15:19.207
I'll call ya in a couple of days, OK?

01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:21.452
OK. Bye.

01:15:23.921 --> 01:15:25.748
Bye.

01:15:42.815 --> 01:15:45.732
Hey, somebody get the door,
would ya?

01:15:49.447 --> 01:15:53.527
- Is Eddie here?
- Yeah, he's in the back.

01:15:58.289 --> 01:16:01.705
- Oh, man, what time is it?
- Too early for visitors.

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:04.666
Uh, Dave. Where's he goin'?

01:16:11.093 --> 01:16:14.842
- Hey, girl.
- Sorry. I didn't mean that.

01:16:14.972 --> 01:16:17.012
- Hi, Eddie.
- Fred!

01:16:17.850 --> 01:16:21.136
- Fred, what are you doin' here?
- You said we could...

01:16:21.937 --> 01:16:24.144
Oh, Fred. Would you get outta here?

01:16:24.356 --> 01:16:26.563
Go on, get outta here. Damn.

01:16:30.529 --> 01:16:33.067
Very nice, fellas!

01:16:33.199 --> 01:16:34.823
Very nice.

01:16:38.287 --> 01:16:39.995
Fred!

01:16:43.667 --> 01:16:45.625
Come on, Fred. Wait up, man.

01:16:48.923 --> 01:16:52.707
Fred, wait up. Freddie. Wait up, Freddie.

01:16:52.843 --> 01:16:55.050
Freddie, Freddie. Wait up, man.

01:16:55.971 --> 01:17:01.346
Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you, but
you can't walk in on people like that, man.

01:17:02.019 --> 01:17:04.226
You said we were gonna play pool.

01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:08.182
- I did?
- You said so.

01:17:08.317 --> 01:17:10.808
People say that stuff
to each other all the time.

01:17:10.945 --> 01:17:14.361
That don't really mean that they mean it,
you know?

01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:16.317
Look.

01:17:16.450 --> 01:17:19.570
You're a kid and I'm a grown-up.

01:17:20.329 --> 01:17:24.825
I love doing stuff with you, but I can't
do stuff with all day every day...

01:17:24.959 --> 01:17:28.125
...cos I gotta do stuff with other grown-ups.

01:17:29.422 --> 01:17:33.502
What I'm tryin' to say is that
we can't hang out together all the time.

01:17:33.634 --> 01:17:35.959
I'm not your babysitter, Freddie.

01:17:36.971 --> 01:17:39.972
I just can't take that kinda responsibility.

01:17:41.016 --> 01:17:43.686
But, hey... it's no big deal, is it?

01:18:50.544 --> 01:18:52.952
Hi.

01:18:53.547 --> 01:18:55.374
Hi.

01:19:14.276 --> 01:19:16.020
Oh, Fred.

01:19:16.153 --> 01:19:20.400
What was the name of that computer
that you raced in Dr Ellis's class?

01:19:20.533 --> 01:19:23.783
- Mike.
- Mike. That's it.

01:19:31.168 --> 01:19:35.248
Fred, it's two o'clock in the morning.
What are you doing up so late?

01:19:35.381 --> 01:19:38.002
I had a bad dream.

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:41.133
Oh.

01:19:41.262 --> 01:19:44.595
Well, why don't you get a drink of water?

01:19:45.933 --> 01:19:48.305
What for?

01:19:49.812 --> 01:19:52.268
Don't you want a drink of water?

01:19:52.398 --> 01:19:54.971
I'm not thirsty.

01:19:56.986 --> 01:20:03.273
Well, why don't you leave the light on,
or turn on the radio? Something.

01:20:03.409 --> 01:20:06.944
It's really late
and we've got a big day tomorrow.

01:20:36.692 --> 01:20:38.484
- Hello?
- Is Dede there?

01:20:38.611 --> 01:20:41.944
Uh... I can't hear you.
Hey, is that you, Fred?

01:20:42.073 --> 01:20:44.943
How you doin'?
Are you missin' a good party down here.

01:20:45.076 --> 01:20:48.694
- Is Dede there?
- Whoo! We're celebrating 4th July early.

01:20:48.829 --> 01:20:53.740
Me and Valerie woke up and everyone
was in the pool. Bottle rockets!

01:20:53.876 --> 01:20:55.916
Fenton, will you just tell...

01:21:16.232 --> 01:21:18.271
A man waving goodbye.

01:21:20.152 --> 01:21:22.192
Two cats fighting.

01:21:24.115 --> 01:21:26.154
A capsized boat.

01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:29.950
A dead body.

01:22:15.541 --> 01:22:17.581
See how this tastes.

01:22:22.339 --> 01:22:26.468
Well, we can stop on the way
to the city and get something to eat.

01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:32.172
Where's your tie?

01:22:43.652 --> 01:22:46.060
- I need a belt, Jane.
- Hm?

01:22:46.197 --> 01:22:48.866
- I need a belt.
- Oh.

01:22:49.825 --> 01:22:52.779
Just tuck in your shirt, you'll be fine.

01:22:54.705 --> 01:22:58.240
It seems to me you had
a midterm the other day.

01:22:58.376 --> 01:23:01.330
- How do you think you did?
- Fine.

01:23:01.462 --> 01:23:03.918
I'm sure you did splendidly.

01:23:05.633 --> 01:23:10.259
You think you can tell me
Beaton's refraction formula for the sun?

01:23:10.388 --> 01:23:13.388
Mr Buckner might ask you that.

01:23:14.183 --> 01:23:17.018
Energy plus parallax equals...

01:23:17.144 --> 01:23:20.062
How come you always
ask me about school?

01:23:20.189 --> 01:23:21.517
Hm?

01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:25.148
How come you always talk
like you're reading a book?

01:23:25.695 --> 01:23:28.565
How come nobody ever comes over?

01:23:29.532 --> 01:23:33.114
And... how come you don't
have any kids of your own?

01:23:34.662 --> 01:23:37.117
What's wrong with you?

01:23:44.296 --> 01:23:46.088
Now, remember, sweetface...

01:23:46.215 --> 01:23:50.165
...zillions of people all over the worid
are gonna be watching you.

01:23:50.302 --> 01:23:54.003
And that means no farting,
no pickin' your nose...

01:23:54.140 --> 01:23:56.809
...and no playing with little Mr Peabody.

01:23:56.934 --> 01:23:59.603
Close your eyes.

01:24:03.733 --> 01:24:05.772
Knock it off, Evan.

01:24:07.111 --> 01:24:08.735
Fred?

01:24:09.572 --> 01:24:12.193
You look very handsome.

01:24:17.538 --> 01:24:19.578
Is she your mom or what?

01:24:23.002 --> 01:24:25.493
She's my...

01:24:25.629 --> 01:24:27.918
I dunno.

01:24:28.049 --> 01:24:30.540
I'll go see if they're ready for you.

01:24:33.763 --> 01:24:36.088
Do you like old pinball machines?

01:24:36.474 --> 01:24:38.762
I dunno.

01:24:39.018 --> 01:24:42.718
We have one in the basement.
You can come play with me.

01:25:08.047 --> 01:25:10.086
- Marco!
- Polo!

01:25:11.342 --> 01:25:13.381
Hey, you guys! Keep it down!

01:25:19.433 --> 01:25:22.268
Welcome to "Live Wire".
I'm Winston F Buckner.

01:25:22.603 --> 01:25:26.850
Today we're gonna be asking
the question "Is your child gifted?"

01:25:27.525 --> 01:25:31.736
With me here to answer that
are two distinguished academics...

01:25:32.238 --> 01:25:34.859
...and several bright kids...

01:25:34.990 --> 01:25:38.573
...from the best schools around
the country. Welcome, everybody.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:45.834
Now, children, do you read books
or watch television like normal kids?

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:51.250
I'm working on experiments involving
lasers, sulphuric acid and butterflies.

01:25:51.465 --> 01:25:54.300
I'm designing a summerhouse
for my parents.

01:25:54.677 --> 01:25:57.962
- I bring in the mail.
- You bring in the mail?

01:25:58.556 --> 01:26:00.595
God, you look like hell, kid.

01:26:01.892 --> 01:26:05.344
Well... Fred, we do many things together.

01:26:05.479 --> 01:26:08.765
We go to museums, we go to the opera.

01:26:09.942 --> 01:26:12.611
He writes letters to his Romanian pen pal.

01:26:13.821 --> 01:26:16.229
These books are fake.

01:26:16.365 --> 01:26:20.445
Fred, as I understand it,
you're a poet, a painter, a musician...

01:26:20.578 --> 01:26:22.570
...and what I guess one could call a...

01:26:22.705 --> 01:26:25.410
- Marco!
- Polo.

01:26:25.541 --> 01:26:29.621
Now, with all that under that
tiny little belt of yours...

01:26:29.754 --> 01:26:31.960
...what would you like
to be when you grow up?

01:26:32.298 --> 01:26:34.374
- A fireman.
- A fireman.

01:26:34.508 --> 01:26:39.965
That's a pretty normal profession
for such a... how shall I put it...

01:26:40.097 --> 01:26:42.932
...an unusual boy like yourself.

01:26:43.309 --> 01:26:47.353
When I was a boy, our mothers all
wanted us to grow up to be doctors.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.805
My mother's dead.

01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:53.060
I, uh... I'm very sorry to hear that.

01:26:53.194 --> 01:26:56.812
Well, enough small talk, Fred.
What shall we do for our audience?

01:26:57.114 --> 01:27:02.488
I thought maybe you could play the piano
for us and do a few quick calculations?

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:04.862
- No.
- No?

01:27:05.748 --> 01:27:07.990
- Mr Buckner...
- I'd like to recite a poem.

01:27:08.125 --> 01:27:14.495
Ah, a poem by Fred Tate when
we come back, right after this.

01:27:23.474 --> 01:27:25.052
Hey!

01:27:25.184 --> 01:27:27.390
Hey, you guys!

01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:30.307
Mommy! Mommy!

01:27:30.981 --> 01:27:33.354
"Clipper Ships" by Fred Tate.

01:27:33.734 --> 01:27:35.110
Go get your mother!

01:27:35.528 --> 01:27:38.232
"Me and my dad make
models of clipper ships."

01:27:42.993 --> 01:27:45.319
"Clipper ships sail on the ocean."

01:27:45.454 --> 01:27:48.372
"Clipper ships never sail
on rivers or lakes."

01:27:55.089 --> 01:27:57.794
"I like clipper ships
because they are fast."

01:27:58.342 --> 01:28:00.382
Fenton!

01:28:13.482 --> 01:28:17.017
"Clipper ships have lots of sails
and are made of wood."

01:28:26.746 --> 01:28:29.616
- Stand by. We'll be back in 3 seconds.
- Oh, Fred.

01:29:23.010 --> 01:29:25.466
Yes. Is Dede Tate there, please?

01:29:27.098 --> 01:29:29.849
Where is she? Gone where?

01:29:31.852 --> 01:29:34.308
Nice to meet you, too, Fenton.

01:29:36.023 --> 01:29:39.357
Which flight is she on?
Fenton? Which flight?

01:29:41.445 --> 01:29:43.237
Thank you.

01:29:43.364 --> 01:29:45.403
She's on her way.

01:29:50.955 --> 01:29:53.197
Oh, what have I done?

01:30:43.382 --> 01:30:45.790
Hi, kid.

01:30:45.926 --> 01:30:47.966
Come here.

01:30:51.223 --> 01:30:53.679
I figured you'd be here.

01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:56.184
Sorry.

01:30:56.312 --> 01:31:00.356
Sorry for what?
You didn't do anything. Shh.

01:31:00.483 --> 01:31:03.852
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

01:31:05.112 --> 01:31:07.354
I missed my dance partner.

01:31:08.407 --> 01:31:10.779
Jane's mad at me.

01:31:10.910 --> 01:31:13.827
No. She ain't mad at you.

01:31:15.414 --> 01:31:18.451
She was just worried, that's all.

01:31:18.584 --> 01:31:21.157
We're all gonna work it out, you'll see.

01:31:21.295 --> 01:31:24.166
From now on,
I'm gonna take care of everything.

01:31:24.298 --> 01:31:26.540
You. Me.

01:31:27.551 --> 01:31:29.793
Even Jane, OK?

01:31:32.431 --> 01:31:34.673
Listen, Freddie.

01:31:35.726 --> 01:31:40.103
The day you were born, first minute
I saw you, you know what I said?

01:31:41.399 --> 01:31:43.687
I said "This kid's special."

01:31:45.236 --> 01:31:49.364
"This kid's gonna be different
and I'm not gonna blow it."

01:31:50.032 --> 01:31:52.072
But, um...

01:31:52.201 --> 01:31:54.241
...sometimes, uh...

01:31:55.329 --> 01:32:00.371
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doin'.
Sometimes I just wing it.

01:32:02.044 --> 01:32:04.084
I figure that...

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:09.374
I figure... I love this kid so much...

01:32:10.553 --> 01:32:12.795
...it's gonna be OK.

01:32:13.931 --> 01:32:16.220
And it will.

01:32:17.309 --> 01:32:19.349
You'll see.

01:32:33.075 --> 01:32:35.531
I love you, Mom.

01:32:36.454 --> 01:32:38.909
I love you too, kiddo.

01:32:58.350 --> 01:33:02.894
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late, but the cake
took me longer than I thought to make.

01:33:13.908 --> 01:33:17.028
Happy birthday!

01:33:17.495 --> 01:33:20.068
Well, that pretty much
sums up my life story.

01:33:20.206 --> 01:33:22.245
Come here, birthday boy!

01:33:23.292 --> 01:33:26.163
And incredible as it sounds,
when I turned eight...

01:33:26.295 --> 01:33:28.667
...I had the best birthday party ever.

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:31.833
At least, that's the way I remember it.

01:33:31.967 --> 01:33:34.719
- Happy birthday, Fred.
- Ooh, look at that!

01:33:37.431 --> 01:33:39.471
Even Jane had a good time.

01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:42.683
- Thanks, Jane.
- You're welcome.

01:33:42.812 --> 01:33:45.433
- Care to cut the rug with me?
- N-no, thank you.

01:33:46.399 --> 01:33:48.854
Come on, dance with the kid, Jane.

01:33:51.278 --> 01:33:56.355
I remember we laughed and played
stupid games and danced to old records.

01:33:56.659 --> 01:33:59.114
Nobody seemed to worry about anything.

01:34:06.043 --> 01:34:08.083
- Hey, yaks. Wanna play a game?
- Yeah.

01:34:08.212 --> 01:34:10.964
You two hold your breath until I say stop.

01:34:12.258 --> 01:34:14.297
Ha-ha ha ha-ha!

01:34:14.468 --> 01:34:16.876
I once got this fortune cookie that said...

01:34:17.012 --> 01:34:21.591
..."Only when all who surround you
are different will you truly belong."

01:34:21.726 --> 01:34:24.477
- Thanks for the dance, Fred.
- Hey, it's a party.

01:34:24.603 --> 01:34:26.810
Gotta wear your party hat, Jane.

01:34:26.939 --> 01:34:29.857
Well, we were all different, that's for sure.

01:34:32.611 --> 01:34:34.853
I'd see Jane every day at the Institute.

01:34:34.989 --> 01:34:39.152
And once in a while, Dede'd let her
take us out to fancy restaurants.

01:34:39.285 --> 01:34:41.159
Sometimes we even had fun.

01:34:41.287 --> 01:34:43.326
Ready?

01:34:44.373 --> 01:34:47.327
For a while, I was the most
famous kid at Jane's school.

01:34:47.460 --> 01:34:52.537
But a year later, a six-year-old boy named
Roy Yamaguchi got into law school...

01:34:52.673 --> 01:34:55.627
...and suddenly I wasn't
such a big deal any more.

01:34:56.594 --> 01:34:58.800
But I didn't care...

01:34:58.929 --> 01:35:01.385
...because I was happy.
