13:49.567 --> 13:51.308
- Test at the fortress
said it was unlikely.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.223
- He's about to be
starting quarterback

13:53.267 --> 13:55.573
at one of the most competitive
high schools in the nation...

13:55.617 --> 13:57.140

13:57.184 --> 13:59.882

Doesn't mean he has powers.

throw a deep route?

14:03.146 --> 14:05.018
- And what about Jordan?

14:05.061 --> 14:07.107
All it's gonna do is
make him feel more alien

14:07.150 --> 14:08.673

Trust me, I've been there.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.159

if they don't.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.161
