00:02.130 --> 00:05.691
[carnival music plays,
carnies calling out]

00:05.730 --> 00:08.062
- GUS, YOU'VE BEEN
ON THIS RIDE LIKE 20 TIMES.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.204
I MEAN, WHY ARE YOU
CHICKENING OUT NOW?

00:10.240 --> 00:12.708
- THIS RIDE JUST DOESN'T
SEEM MECHANICALLY SOUND.

00:12.740 --> 00:14.332
HOW DO WE KNOW
IT'S NOT GONNA BREAK

00:14.380 --> 00:16.473
AND EJECT US
OUT OF THE BUILDING?

00:16.510 --> 00:19.217
- GUS, THE RIDE IS 12 INCHES
OFF THE GROUND.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.070
- WELL, WHY ARE YOU NERVOUS?

00:21.120 --> 00:23.680
- BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT ANIMATRONIC GOBLINS

00:23.720 --> 00:26.814
CAN SOMETIMES COME TO LIFE
IN THE WEIRDEST OF SITUATIONS--

00:26.860 --> 00:28.452
- THAT IS THE MOST
RIDICULOUS THING

00:28.490 --> 00:30.185
I'VE EVER HEﬁgD IN MY LIFE.

00:30.230 --> 00:31.424
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

00:31.460 --> 00:33.052
- THEN YOU GO FIRST.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.328
- YOU GO FIRST.

00:34.360 --> 00:37.067
- I WANT TO GO FIRST,
BUT NOT UNTIL YOU GO.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.260
- [scary voice]
YOU'RE DOOMED!

00:38.300 --> 00:41.565
[echoing] DOOM ED!

00:41.600 --> 00:43.465
[screaming]

00:43.510 --> 00:46.673
[laughter]

00:46.710 --> 00:48.109
- YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.642
- [whispers]
PERFECT.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.511
- [whispering]
I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS.

00:57.550 --> 01:01.111
- SHH!

01:02.790 --> 01:05.588
- WE'RE GONNA SOLVE THIS.
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE--

01:05.630 --> 01:08.190
- JULES, COUPLES ARE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE THEIR HANDS

01:08.230 --> 01:10.118
ALL OVER EACH OTHER
AT THIS STAGE, THE BEGINNING.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.467
WE DO THIS NOW.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.388
EIGHT HOURS FROM NOW,
THIS COULD ALL BE OLD HAT.

01:13.440 --> 01:16.204
- EVENTUALLY, CARLTON
IS GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT US.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.468
- I'VE SEEN
HIS DETECTIVE SKILLS.

01:17.510 --> 01:19.330
THAT COULD TAKE YEARS.
- WE SHOULD MAKE A PLAN.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.529
IN CASE EVERYONE FINDS OUT

01:20.580 --> 01:22.138
AND WE CAN'T WORK CASES
TOGETHER ANYMORE.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.205
- I HAVE A PLAN.
IT'S CALLED "NEVER TELL ANYONE."

01:24.250 --> 01:26.468
- EVENTUALLY,
EVERYONE IS GOING TO KNOW,

01:26.520 --> 01:28.476
AND IT IS YOUR FAULT
THAT RULE IS IN PLACE.

01:28.520 --> 01:30.147
- IF I HADN'T OUTED LASSITER'S
AFFAIR WITH HIS OLD PARTNER,

01:30.190 --> 01:31.009
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.517
- YOU THINK I HAVEN'T
CONSIDERED THAT?

01:32.560 --> 01:33.515
- [whispers]
LET'S MOVE TO THE COT.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.710
- [whispers] DO YOU KNOW
WHO'S BEEN ON THAT COT?

01:35.760 --> 01:36.886
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'VE DONE?

01:36.930 --> 01:39.228
- THAT IS SUCH
AN INCREDIBLE BUZZ KILL.

01:39.260 --> 01:41.353
- AH, I'M SORRY.
- ALL RIGHT.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.789
NO TOUCHING
IN THE POLICE STATION.

01:43.830 --> 01:45.764
ACTUALLY, THAT'S ALWAYS
BEEN MY RULE.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.189
- I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.
- YOU DO?

01:48.240 --> 01:49.468
- TWO TICKETS

01:49.510 --> 01:52.138
TO SCARE FEST TOMORROW!

01:52.180 --> 01:54.205
OPENING DAY WAS SOLID OUT,
SO I GOT DAY TWO ONLINE.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.800
YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT
SINCE THEY ANNOUNCED

01:56.850 --> 01:57.942
THEY WERE GONNA DO ANOTHER ONE,

01:57.980 --> 02:00.346
AND I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE
THAT PLACE THROUGH YOUR EYES.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.610
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE GOING
WITH GUS, AREN'T YOU?

02:02.650 --> 02:03.810
- TONIGHT.

02:03.850 --> 02:06.512
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL GO WITH BOTH OF YA.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.619
AND I'LL SCREAM JUST AS LOUD
WITH YOU AS I DO WITH GUS.

02:08.660 --> 02:10.218
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S FINE.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.682
I-I'LL FIND SOMETHING ELSE
FOR US TO DO.

02:11.730 --> 02:13.425
IT PROBABLY MEANS
A LOT FOR YOU GUYS.

02:13.460 --> 02:14.392
- NO, NO, NO, JULES,
JULES, JULES.

02:14.430 --> 02:16.660
I WOULD MUCH RATHER
GO WITH YOU--OBVIOUSLY.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.396
THE TWO OF US GE'ITIN'
THE BEANS SCARED OUT OF US

02:19.440 --> 02:21.761
BY DISGRUNTLED TEENAGERS
IN MICHAEL MYERS MASKS?

02:21.800 --> 02:24.166
COME ON.
- ARE YOU SURE?

02:24.210 --> 02:25.632
- OF COURSE I'M SURE.
GUS'LL UNDERSTAND.

02:25.670 --> 02:28.309
- OH, SO YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT US?
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

02:28.340 --> 02:29.944
THAT'D BE LIKE POSTING IT
ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.379
IF I HAD A FACEBOOK PAGE.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.219
OR THE DESIRE TO SHARE
INTIMATE LIFE DETAILS

02:33.250 --> 02:34.877
WITH PEOPLE
I'D AVOID ON THE STREET.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.814
I'M GONNA TELL HIM.
I AM. AND SOON.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.259
TRY TO UNDERSTAND.

02:42.290 --> 02:44.827
THIS IS GONNA BE LIKE A BOMB

02:44.860 --> 02:46.555
LANDING ON HIS SWEET HEAD.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.249
IT MEANS
HE'S THE ODD MAN OUT AGAIN.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.460
IF I DON'T HANDLE THIS
DELICATELY,

02:49.500 --> 02:51.491
HE'S BOUND TO GO ON
ANOTHER CARAMEL BINGE.

02:51.530 --> 02:53.259
- HE WENT ON ONE BEFORE?
- YES.

02:53.300 --> 02:54.858
HOT AND COLD.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.936
TRUST ME.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.447
OKAY, JUST--JUST GO WITH ME
HERE FOR A SECOND.

03:07.480 --> 03:08.970
I KNOW THIS
IS GONNA SOUND CRAZY,

03:09.020 --> 03:11.488
BUT WHAT I'M THINKING IS...

03:11.520 --> 03:14.387
WE DON'T GO TO OPENING NIGHT
OF SCARE FEST.

03:14.420 --> 03:17.218
WE GO NEXT WEEK,
MAYBE SOMETIME IN THE AFTERNOON,

03:17.260 --> 03:18.989
WHEN IT'S NOT CROWDED AT ALL.

03:19.030 --> 03:20.054
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:20.100 --> 03:23.490
I SPENT THE ENTIRE WEEK
FINISHING MY ROUTE EARLY.

03:23.530 --> 03:24.622
I TOOK A VACATION DAY.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.490
- OH, NO.
GUS, WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.599
- YOU ASKED ME TO.
- WHEN?

03:28.640 --> 03:30.961
- THE DAY THEY ANNOUNCED THEY
WERE HAVING SCARE FEST AGAIN.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.773
- I DON'T RECALL THAT.
- I HAVE YOUR SPEECH

03:32.810 --> 03:34.402
AS A VIDEO FILE
ON MY BLACKBERRY, SHAWN.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.500
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY, ENOUGH
WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY. HA.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.645
THE TRUTH IS,
IT'S MY HOROSCOPE.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.910
IT SAYS I SHOULD AVOID PLACES
WITH URINAL TROUGHS,

03:43.950 --> 03:46.418
AND I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE
I CAN TAKE THE RISK RIGHT NOW.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.553
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.285
ARE YOU CRYING?

03:50.330 --> 03:52.298
- I'M DISAPPOINTED, SHAWN.

03:52.330 --> 03:54.821
- GOD.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.788
HA HA!
I GOT YOU, MAN!

03:59.840 --> 04:02.400
COURSE WE'RE GOING
TO SCARE FEST.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.305
COME ON, MAN, YOU AND ME!
OPENING DAY.

04:04.340 --> 04:05.534
- SWEET.

04:05.570 --> 04:07.379
- WE JUST GO'I'I'A KEEP IT
BETWEEN US, THOUGH.

04:07.410 --> 04:09.549
- WHAT?
- NOTHING! COME ON!

04:09.580 --> 04:10.740
COME ON.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.946
- FIRST ONES THROUGH THE GATES.
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

04:18.990 --> 04:22.949
- YEAH. IT'S GENERALLY SCARIER
ONCE THE SUN ACTUALLY GOES DOWN.

04:22.990 --> 04:24.685
- WHY HAVE YOU BEEN
SO NERVOUS LATELY?

04:24.730 --> 04:26.459
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
TO THE OFFICE IN THE LAST--

04:26.500 --> 04:27.922
- NOTHING!
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NOTHING?

04:27.960 --> 04:29.769
YOU DIDN'T EVEN LET ME
FINISH MY QUESTION.

04:29.800 --> 04:30.994
WHAT'S--
- WHAT DO I HAVE TO HIDE--

04:31.030 --> 04:32.634
MY JOY THAT WE HAVE
SCARE FEST BACK

04:32.670 --> 04:33.739
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 15 YEARS?

04:33.770 --> 04:35.692
- WHENEVER YOU'RE LYING,
YOU NEVER LET ME FINISH MY--

04:35.740 --> 04:37.662
- GUS, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO FIRST, HUH?

04:37.710 --> 04:39.371
WHERE WE GOING FIRST?

04:39.410 --> 04:44.677
[figure chuckling menacingly]

04:44.710 --> 04:47.042
COME ON, GUS...YOU KNOW RING
TOSS HAS NEVER BEEN YOUR THING.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.548
- MY CARPAL TUNNEL
WAS ACTING UP, SHAWN.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.013
- OKAY.
- IT WAS.

04:52.050 --> 04:54.052
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHO ARE YOU HIDING FROM?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.552
- KEN, OUR OLD ASSISTANT?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.353
- I PROMISED I'D GIVE HIM
A PERSONAL REFERENCE

05:00.400 --> 05:01.924
FOR THIS IBM JOB,

05:01.960 --> 05:04.520
I JUST REMEMBERED--I NEVER
CALLED THE IBM GUY BACK.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.664
- I GUESS HE DIDN'T GET
THAT JOB--NICE GOING.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.930
- DUDE, YOU, ME, HAUNTED HOUSE.
LET'S RIDE SOME RIDES.

05:09.970 --> 05:11.369
- WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.

05:11.410 --> 05:12.877
WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD
ANY CHURROS YET.

05:12.910 --> 05:14.605
THIS YEAR
THEY'RE WRAPPING THEM IN BACON.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.675
- DIDN'T WE COME HERE
TO BE SCARED?

05:15.710 --> 05:16.870
- EXACTLY. WHAT'S MORE SCARY

05:16.910 --> 05:18.104
THAN A CHURRO
WRAPPED IN BACON?

05:18.150 --> 05:19.777
- YOU'RE STALLING.
- NO, I'M NOT.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.469
- NO, I'M NOT.
- YOU'RE STALLING.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.511
- LET'S GO.

05:30.430 --> 05:32.796
WOULD YOU HAVE SOME
RESPECT FOR YOURSELF?

05:35.560 --> 05:38.859
[making eerie sounds]
OOH...EEE...OOH.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.959
[chuckles]
GET IN THERE.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.665

BEING SO SNUG. HA HA.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.735
[grunts]
UHH!

05:46.780 --> 05:48.532
- UM...'SCUSE ME.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.605
THIS LAP BAR'S
CONSTRICTING MY BLOOD FLOW.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.811
- SAFETY IS PRIORITY ONE
AT SCARE FEST.

05:52.850 --> 05:54.670
- YES, BUT THIS BAR
IS ACTING AS A TOURNIQUET

05:54.720 --> 05:55.812
ON MY RIGHT LEG.

05:55.850 --> 05:58.410
- TAKE IT UP WITH MY BOSS.
[CIICK]

05:58.450 --> 06:00.486
- WOULD YOU RELAX?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

06:00.520 --> 06:02.659
- WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
WHEN I NEED TO UNHARNESS MYSELF

06:02.690 --> 06:05.523
AFI'ER THIS CAR IS INEVITABLY
JETI'ISONED OUT ONTO THE MIDWAY?

06:05.560 --> 06:07.391
- THIS CAR IS TRAVELING
3 MILES PER HOUR.

06:07.430 --> 06:12.959
[menacing laughter,
shrieking, howling]

06:17.040 --> 06:18.598
HA HA! NICE.

06:21.980 --> 06:24.369
[ghostly moaning]
OOH...HHHH...

06:27.020 --> 06:29.079
[deep evil laugh]

06:29.120 --> 06:31.987
DUDE, YOU'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING.
- I'M DRINKING IT ALL IN.

06:32.020 --> 06:33.487
- YOUR EYES ARE CLOSED,

06:33.520 --> 06:34.953
AND YOU'RE PRETENDING
TO BE STARTLED BY THINGS.

06:34.990 --> 06:39.051
- I WAS JUST STARTLED.
- BY WHAT, THE EXIT LIGHT?

06:39.090 --> 06:42.025
THAT GUY'S SHOCKINGLY
REAL-LOOKING.

06:43.970 --> 06:46.564

AAH!

07:02.490 --> 07:04.708
[continues chuckling]

07:04.750 --> 07:07.856
AH...DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB,
I GO'I'I'A SAY.

07:07.890 --> 07:11.053
[strangling sounds]

07:14.160 --> 07:15.696
WAIT A MINUTE.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.758
GUS, DID YOU SEE THAT?
- I WAS TESTING MY WATCH

07:22.810 --> 07:24.129
TO SEE IF IT GLOWED
IN THE DARK.

07:24.170 --> 07:27.571
- GUS, I JUST SAW
SOMEBODY GET KILLED.

07:27.610 --> 07:30.773
GUS, GUS,
I CAN'T OPEN THIS THING!

07:34.150 --> 07:37.779
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

07:37.820 --> 07:40.914
*

07:40.960 --> 07:44.782
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

07:44.830 --> 07:48.129
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

07:48.160 --> 07:49.889
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

07:49.930 --> 07:51.124
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

07:51.170 --> 07:55.891

TO THE SAME DAMN SONG *

07:55.940 --> 08:01.936
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

08:01.980 --> 08:04.540

- HEY! YOU. CAROL.

08:27.770 --> 08:30.136
THERE IS A MURDERER LOOSE
IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

08:30.170 --> 08:32.309
YOU GOTTA SHUT THIS RIDE DOWN
RIGHT NOW.

08:32.340 --> 08:33.932
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
CALM DOWN.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.538
I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE A LITTLE FREAKED OUT.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.138
BUT IF YOU'LL NOTICE,
THERE'S A SIGN OUTSIDE

08:37.180 --> 08:38.374
THAT SAYS THE WORD SPOOKY.

08:38.410 --> 08:41.243
THAT MEANS THERE'S A MURDER
IN THERE ABOUT EVERY 25 SECONDS.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.611
WELL, ACTUALLY, EVERY 45,

08:42.650 --> 08:44.117
SINCE HALF THE ANIMATION
ISN'T WORKING YET.

08:44.150 --> 08:45.287
- YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

08:45.320 --> 08:47.151
I JUST SAW A MAN
GASPING FOR HIS LIFE.

08:47.190 --> 08:49.010
- YOU SAW A VOLLEYBALL
ON A BROOMSTICK.

08:49.060 --> 08:52.257
- NO! YES, I SAW THAT TOO.
THE ILLUSION ACTUALLY PLAYED.

08:52.290 --> 08:53.826
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT.

08:53.860 --> 08:55.327
- [sighs]
DID YOU SEE IT?

08:55.360 --> 08:58.295
- I WAS PREVIOUSLY ENGAGED.
- HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING!

08:58.330 --> 09:00.639

09:03.040 --> 09:04.701
I'M SURE TODD IS PRETTY DREAMY,

09:04.740 --> 09:06.139
EVEN THOUGH
HE CAN'T SPELL "BITCHIN'".

09:06.170 --> 09:07.899
BUT I'M ASSUMING
THAT JUST LIKE HEAVEN

09:07.940 --> 09:09.669
AND EXHALING, HE CAN WAIT.

09:09.710 --> 09:11.200
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
OUR JOB IS TO SCARE,

09:11.250 --> 09:12.342
AND BY THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE,

09:12.380 --> 09:14.109
I'D SAY WE DID
A PRETTY GOOD JOB.

09:14.150 --> 09:17.244
- SO...UNLESS YOU HAVE
38 MORE TICKETS TO RIDE AGAIN,

09:17.290 --> 09:18.780
I SUGGEST YOU GET LOST.

09:18.820 --> 09:20.151
- YOU'RE GONNA FEEL BAD.
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL SILLY...

09:20.190 --> 09:21.157
- AWFUL.
- AND BAD.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.329
GIRL WAS MEAN.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.726
- YOU TRY MAKING MINIMUM WAGE
AND HAVING TO WEAR THAT UNIFORM.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.227
SEE HOW FRIENDLY YOU ARE.

09:27.260 --> 09:28.989
LET'S JUST GO.
- SHH!

09:31.070 --> 09:33.994
- MAN!

09:34.040 --> 09:36.292
KEN!

09:38.310 --> 09:40.005
- NO WAY.
- YES, WAY...IN A BIG WAY.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.338
CAN I HAVE YOUR KEYS?
- WHAT?

09:42.380 --> 09:44.871
- I JUST SAW A GUY GET KILLED.
- WHERE?

09:44.910 --> 09:46.844
- IN THE MURDER ROOM
AT THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.279
- ISN'T THAT WHAT'S
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN?

09:48.320 --> 09:50.948
- REAL GUY. REAL MURDER.
- DID YOU TELL ANYONE?

09:50.990 --> 09:52.343
- WE TOLD CAROL.
SHE WAS SO BUSY TEXTING

09:55.060 --> 09:56.186
- WILL YOU LET THAT GO?
- BITCHIN', GUS.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.927
BIT-CHIN. IT'S THE ONLY WORD
I INSIST PEOPLE GET RIGHT.

09:58.960 --> 10:00.325
OTHERWISE, YOU'RE SAYING
IT'S BI-CHIN.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.759
WHICH IS CHINESE
FOR "TOO MUCH FACE."

10:01.800 --> 10:03.961
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, KEN?
- SERIOUSLY, DUDE.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.865
I ALREADY TOLD YOU LAST TIME.
SIX WORDS.

10:05.900 --> 10:06.935
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GO TELL SOMEONE ELSE?

10:06.970 --> 10:09.336
- WE'RE TELLING YOU, KEN.
AND YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?

10:09.370 --> 10:10.962
BECAUSE IT IS HIGH TIME

10:11.010 --> 10:13.035
THAT WE GOT THE TEAM
BACK TOGETHER, MAN.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.968
THIS IS THE KIND OF
BIG MONEY CASE

10:15.010 --> 10:17.945
THAT'LL ALLOW US TO HIRE BACK
OUR BEST ASIAN ASSISTANT EVER.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.288
AND IT FEELS...SO GOOD.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.389
- I LIKE THAT SONG.

10:24.420 --> 10:25.887
I'M ONLY ALLOWED

10:25.920 --> 10:27.353
TO USE THESE ACCESS KEYS
FOR BUSINESS.

10:27.390 --> 10:29.779
- MURDER IS OUR BUSINESS.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.752
- DUDE, I COULD GET FIRED.
OR WORSE.

10:31.790 --> 10:35.089
- OR YOU CAN GET YOURSELF
BACK IN THE DETECTIVE GAME.

10:35.130 --> 10:37.928
- I NEVER HAVE ACTUALLY
BEEN ABLE TO DO A CASE.

10:37.970 --> 10:40.097
- THAT...
IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!

10:40.140 --> 10:42.199
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:42.240 --> 10:43.969
ARE YOU SERIOUS, SHAWN?

10:44.010 --> 10:46.365
- [quietly]
DON'T CAUSE A COMMOTION.

10:48.840 --> 10:51.172
ARE YOU IN?
- I'M OUT.

10:51.210 --> 10:53.144
- SO AM I
- I DIDN'T ASK YOU.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.774
- THIS IS AS FAR AS I GO.
- [softly] HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

10:55.820 --> 10:57.117
- I'LL CLOSE THE DOOR
BEHIND YOU.

10:57.150 --> 10:59.414
- GET IN HERE!

11:01.420 --> 11:03.251
[deep laughter]

11:03.290 --> 11:04.848
ALL RIGHT, GUS,
DON'T BE SCARED.

11:04.890 --> 11:07.051
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW DANGEROUS THIS IS?

11:07.100 --> 11:09.398
THEY'RE GONNA FIND
A DEAD BODY ALL RIGHT--MINE,

11:09.430 --> 11:11.068
DRUG BY ONE OF THESE
RIDE CARS.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.034
- YOU'LL BE THE FIRST
DOCUMENTED DRAGGING DEATH

11:13.070 --> 11:14.731
AT 3 MILES PER HOUR.

11:14.770 --> 11:17.034
- ACTUALLY, I'LL BE THE THIRD.
IN 1974, THERE WAS A GUY--

11:17.070 --> 11:18.935
- I CAN'T DO THIS
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW

11:18.970 --> 11:20.779
HERE IN THE RIDE.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.971
OOH! BLEND IN.

11:24.050 --> 11:29.374
- [shrilly] AARRGGGHHH!

11:29.420 --> 11:32.912
MY EYE!
[whimpers]

11:32.960 --> 11:35.918
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, "MY EYE"?
YOU SAYING "MY EYE" AT THE END?

11:35.960 --> 11:37.188
- I LET OUT
A VERY EERIE ARGH.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.118
- WASN'T EERIE.
- AND THEN I ADDED A LAYER

11:39.160 --> 11:40.320
TO INTIMATE THAT MY EYE
HAD BEEN REMOVED

11:40.360 --> 11:41.452
OR SOMETHING HORRIFYING
LIKE THAT.

11:41.500 --> 11:44.469
- OR THAT YOU HAD A LOOSE
EYELASH OR POSSIBLY A STY.

11:44.500 --> 11:47.139
- EYES ARE SCARY ON
A PSYCHOLOGICAL LEVEL, SHAWN.

11:47.170 --> 11:50.264
- SO YOU'RE WARNING RIDERS OF
THE DANGERS OF CONJUNCTIVITIS.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.062
- WHAT, YOU CAN DO BETTER?
- I BELIEVE I CAN.

11:52.110 --> 11:53.407
- PLEASE!

11:55.310 --> 11:57.198
- [muffled]
WAIT FOR IT.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.478
WAIT FOR I--

11:58.510 --> 12:00.444
[shrilly]
EEEEAAAHHHH!

12:00.480 --> 12:02.846
- THESE GOBLINS
SMELL LIKE BACON.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.983
- EEEEHHH...

12:05.020 --> 12:08.285
[lower pitch]
EEEHHH.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.355
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

12:12.390 --> 12:14.790
- [sniffs]
YOU DO SMELL LIKE BACON.

12:14.830 --> 12:17.196
- YOU SMELL LIKE BACON.
- SMELL YOURSELF.

12:17.230 --> 12:19.323
- [sniffs] WHY DO I
SMELL LIKE BACON, SHAWN?

12:19.370 --> 12:22.066
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT'S NOT GOOD.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.814
HAPPENED RIGHT THERE.

12:38.850 --> 12:41.387
HE'S IN HERE!

12:42.590 --> 12:45.479
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, GUS.

12:45.530 --> 12:48.954
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.093
- I WILL NEVER LET YOU
LIVE THIS DOWN.

12:51.130 --> 12:53.860
- I KNOW WHAT I SAW, GUS.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.533
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.946
I'M IN CARNIVAL JAIL.
- WHAT ARE YOU SO WORRIED ABOUT?

13:02.980 --> 13:05.278
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE GONNA
CALL OUR PARENTS OR SOMETHING.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.846
HOLY CRAP.

13:11.890 --> 13:13.209
DAD!

13:13.260 --> 13:14.557
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON, SHAWN?

13:14.590 --> 13:16.820
- WELL, I-I'M AT SCARE FEST.

13:16.860 --> 13:18.555
- OH, I KNOW.
PARK SECURITY JUST CALLED.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.251
- THEY CALLED YOU?
- THAT'S WHAT THEY DO, SHAWN.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.551
THEY CALL THE POLICE
WHEN THEY BUST SOMEBODY.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.465
YOU'RE JUST LUCKY
I PICKED UP.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.319
I'M ON MY CELL NOW.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.588
- LISTEN, I WITNESSED
A MURDER, OKAY?

13:26.630 --> 13:29.269
- WHERE?
- IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

13:29.300 --> 13:31.234
DAD, I'M SERIOUS.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.874
THERE WAS A STRUGGLE.
IT WAS TERRIBLE.

13:32.910 --> 13:35.936
- DID GUS SEE IT TOO?
- NO.

13:35.980 --> 13:38.540
- ANYBODY ELSE?
- IT WAS VERY DARK IN THERE.

13:38.580 --> 13:41.014
- SHAWN, YOU KNOW HOW YOU GET
ALL WORKED UP WITH THOSE THINGS.

13:41.050 --> 13:42.415
- THANKS A LOT.

13:42.450 --> 13:43.519
MAN...

13:46.320 --> 13:47.412
- WE'RE GONNA GET
ARRESTED, AREN'T WE?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.257
- GUS, DON'T BE
THE ONLY BLACK LEAD

13:49.290 --> 13:52.054
ON A MAJOR CABLE NETWORK.
MY DAD'S NEVER HAD ME ARRESTED.

13:52.090 --> 13:53.296
- YES, HE HAS, SHAWN.

13:53.330 --> 13:55.195
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:55.230 --> 13:56.891
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

13:56.930 --> 13:59.467
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA
SQUEEZE THROUGH THIS WINDOW

13:59.500 --> 14:01.468
AND THEN CIRCLE AROUND
TO THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.489
- THEN WHAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:02.540 --> 14:04.167
CREATE A DIVERSION.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.529
THROW UP ON A BABY.
SING REALLY LOUDLY.

14:05.570 --> 14:06.969
PEE IN THE DUNK TANK.

14:07.010 --> 14:08.637
- MY ARM COULDN'T FIT
THROUGH THERE, SHAWN.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.977
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:10.010 --> 14:11.147
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE WEARING FLOATIES.

14:11.180 --> 14:13.011
YOU'RE GONNA SQUEEZE THROUGH
THAT LIKE OLD TOOTHPASTE.

14:13.050 --> 14:15.041
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A PUSH.
I'VE SEEN THIS WORK

14:15.080 --> 14:17.184
PLENTY OF TIMES.
- WHERE, ON WINNIE THE POOH?

14:17.220 --> 14:19.950
- AND OTHER PLACES.
- OH, MY GOSH.

14:19.990 --> 14:22.288
- GENTLEMEN, COME WITH ME.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.480
- YOU SEE?
- YOU SEE?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.225
- BE HALFWAY TO DEL TACO
BY NOW.

14:25.260 --> 14:26.625
- YEAH. SEE?

14:26.660 --> 14:29.857
- YOU JUST WANNA BE STANDING
HERE TALKING NONSENSE.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.233
- WHEN I HEARD TWO BOYS
SNUCK ONTO A RIDE,

14:35.270 --> 14:36.635
I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS.

14:36.670 --> 14:39.639
- WHY? BECAUSE HE'S BLACK?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:39.670 --> 14:40.773
- [whispers]
I'M PLAYING THE RACE CARD.

14:40.810 --> 14:43.904
- EVEN IF THAT WAS OKAY FOR YOU,
YOU'RE PLAYING IT WRONG.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.099
- I DOUBLE-DOWN.

14:45.150 --> 14:48.244
- THOUGHT YOU SAW A MURDER.
HMM.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.579
OKAY. YOU WERE TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING, I GUESS.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.156
YOU IMAGINED SOMETHING.

14:53.190 --> 14:54.987
I DO TOO, SOMETIMES.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.921
IT IS A HAUNTED HOUSE,
AFTER ALL.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.951
SO JUST FILL OUT THESE FORMS,

15:00.000 --> 15:01.627
AND I'LL MAKE SURE
YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY.

15:01.660 --> 15:03.423
- [quietly]
THANK YOU.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.268
THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

15:18.150 --> 15:20.710
- SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU WRITING?

15:20.750 --> 15:23.287
DUDE, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
WILL YOU LEAVE IT ALONE?

15:23.320 --> 15:25.242
IT'S JUST YOUR STUPID
IMAGINATION RUNNING WILD.

15:25.290 --> 15:26.518
- GUS, I KNOW WHAT I SAW,

15:26.550 --> 15:28.586
AND I'M THE BEST OBSERVER
THAT YOU KNOW.

15:28.620 --> 15:30.986
- LAST WEEK, YOU THOUGHT
A SPONGE IN THE PSYCH OFFICE

15:31.030 --> 15:32.349
WAS AN OWL.
- IF YOU'D STOP BUYING THEM

15:32.390 --> 15:34.051
IN BIRD COLORS,
THAT WOULD STOP HAPPENING.

15:39.070 --> 15:41.538
THAT'S THE GUY!

15:41.570 --> 15:44.562
HE'S THE ONE I SAW GET MURDERED.
RIGHT THERE ON THE WALL.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.570
- THAT'S THE PARK PRESIDENT.

15:48.610 --> 15:51.249
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM
FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.248
- WHAT?
- HE MISSED A BIG MEETING

15:53.280 --> 15:55.316
WITH CREDITORS.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.712
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT, HMM?

15:58.750 --> 16:01.355
- SHUT DOWN THE HAUNTED HOUSE.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.021
- HE WAS RIGHT HERE!

16:04.060 --> 16:06.278
HE WAS DRAGGED
AWAY FROM THE TRACK.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.992
- WHERE WERE YOU HIDING
WHEN ALL THIS TOOK PLACE?

16:09.030 --> 16:10.395
- I WASN'T HIDING.
BUT MY HEAD WAS DOWN.

16:10.430 --> 16:12.523
I WAS TRYING TO AVOID
DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS.

16:12.570 --> 16:15.095
- THAT'S NOT A THING, GUS.
- IT IS A THING, SHAWN.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.266
PEOPLE DIE FROM IT ON PLANES

16:16.300 --> 16:18.439
WHEN THEY'RE NOT SITTING
IN FIRST CLASS.

16:18.470 --> 16:19.607
- HE'S OVER HERE!

16:24.610 --> 16:26.771
- WELL...

16:26.810 --> 16:29.608
AS MUCH AS
"GOOD WORK, SPENCER," PAINS ME--

16:29.650 --> 16:31.481
- NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS ALL WRONG.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.158
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- THIS IS THE OTHER SIDE

16:33.190 --> 16:35.249
OF THE RIDE--THERE'S NO WAY
HE STUMBLED THIS FAR.

16:35.290 --> 16:36.314
AND THERE WAS NO MASK.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.523
- THE MASK IS MR. WAYLAND'S.
HE LOVES SCARE FEST.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.050
HE USED TO PUT ON THE COSTUMES

16:41.100 --> 16:42.499
AND JUMP OUT
AND SCARE THE CUSTOMERS.

16:42.530 --> 16:44.725
- DID HE EVER USE
ANY SCARY EYE IMAGERY?

16:44.770 --> 16:47.739
- NO. BUT HE ONCE GOT STUCK
IN A SUIT OF ARMOR

16:47.770 --> 16:49.237
IN THE CASTLE.

16:49.270 --> 16:50.669
HE LOVED TO TELL THAT STORY
TO THE NEW HIRES.

16:50.710 --> 16:51.608
- I BET HE DID.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.608
- LOOKS LIKE HE MIGHT
HAVE GOTTEN CAUGHT

16:53.640 --> 16:55.278
IN THESE RETRACTABLE WIRES
IN THE DARK.

16:55.310 --> 16:57.449
- 3 MILES PER HOUR, MY ASS.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.175
I TOLD YOU IT WAS
A DANGEROUS PLACE TO BE IN.

16:59.210 --> 17:00.518
- WHAT A SHAME.

17:00.550 --> 17:02.211
WELL, IT JUST GOES TO SHOW

17:02.250 --> 17:03.649
THAT KIDS SHOULD BE SCARED
BY THE LAW--

17:03.690 --> 17:06.511
NOT ADULTS IN COSTUMES.

17:06.550 --> 17:08.154
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME
RIGHT NOW, LASSIE?

17:08.190 --> 17:11.523
I REPORT THAT A MAN
IS STRANGLED TO DEATH HERE,

17:11.560 --> 17:13.391
THEN A DEAD GUY SHOWS UP
WITH MARKS ON HIS NECK,

17:13.430 --> 17:15.557
AND YOU WON'T BELIEVE
THAT IT'S MURDER.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.761
- FINE.
IT'S UNDER CONSIDERATION.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.769
- WE HAVE A BONA FIDE
SCOOBY-DOO CASE

17:20.800 --> 17:22.131
THAT HAS FALLEN INTO OUR LAPS.

17:22.170 --> 17:23.660
DEAD GUY, HAUNTED HOUSE,
AMUSEMENT PARK.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.337
GUS, SAY ZOINKS.
- I'M NOT SAYING ZOINKS.

17:25.370 --> 17:26.803
- THEN SAY JINKIES.
- JINKIES.

17:26.840 --> 17:30.139
- WE WERE ON THIS RIDE TOGETHER,
AND WE SAW THIS MAN KILLED.

17:30.180 --> 17:32.148
I'M NOT A LIAR.

17:32.180 --> 17:33.647
ABOUT THIS.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.148
I'M N--I'M NOT LYING
ABOUT THE DEAD MAN.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.818
FOR YOU I HAVE AN EXPLANATION.
- FOR WHAT?

17:37.850 --> 17:40.512
- NOTHING.
- MURDERED.

17:40.560 --> 17:41.652
I KNEW IT.

17:41.690 --> 17:44.523
- PARDON ME...DID YOU JUST
SAY THIS MAN WAS MURDERED?

17:44.560 --> 17:47.358
- NOT ONLY THAT, BUT I...
I KNOW WHO THE KILLER IS.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.526
- OKAY, SHH, SHH!

17:48.560 --> 17:49.458
EVERYONE STOP
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.162
YOU TWO, SHUT IT DOWN
IN THE BACK THERE.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.838
PLEASE, SIR...

17:53.870 --> 17:56.589
TELL ALL THESE DOUBTERS
AND SCOOBY-DON'TS

17:56.640 --> 17:59.609
WHO KILLED THIS MAN.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.835
- IT'S JOHNNY RICKETTS.
- JOHNNY RICKETTS.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.279
LASSIE.
GET AN APB OUT.

18:03.310 --> 18:06.302
YOUR SUSPECT '5 NAME
IS JONATHAN RICKETTS.

18:06.350 --> 18:08.272
- WAS.
- I'M SORRY?

18:08.320 --> 18:10.515
- HIS NAME WAS JOHN.

18:10.550 --> 18:12.780
THIS MAN WAS KILLED...

18:12.820 --> 18:16.153
BY THE GHOST OF JOHN RICKETTS.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.452
- HMM.

18:17.490 --> 18:20.152
- I'M GOOD HERE.
FELLAS, WRAP IT UP.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.691
SPENCER,
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN AGAIN.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.265
- ZOINKS.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.805
- YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE
JUST TOLD ME

18:35.840 --> 18:37.501
YOU WERE COMING WITH GUS.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.768
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO LIE.
- WELL, IT WASN'T A LIE.

18:39.810 --> 18:42.210
INITIALLY.
- BUT THEN YOU CAME WITH GUS.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.649
- THAT'S WHEN IT BECAME
A LIE.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.783
I COULDN'T DISAPPOINT HIM.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.879
- OH, WHACK-A-MOLE.
- YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, JULES.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.012
GUS GETS HIS HEART
SET ON THINGS.

18:49.060 --> 18:51.881
THAT'S HOW I ENDED UP
AT CLOGAPALOOZA LAST SATURDAY.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.659
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE KIDDING
ABOUT THAT.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.520
- SEE? THAT'S A TRUTH
THAT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE.

18:55.560 --> 18:57.562
IT'S LIKE A LIE IN REVERSE.
IT'S ALL VERY CONFUSING.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.726
- SHAWN.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.761
- I PROMISE IT WILL NOT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.688
- THE LYING?
- AND CLOGAPALOOZA.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.367
BUT MOSTLY THE LYING.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.605
BUT CLOGAPALOOZA WAS...

19:06.640 --> 19:07.868
- SO YOU TOLD GUS ABOUT US?

19:07.910 --> 19:09.901
- YOU, MA'AM!

19:09.940 --> 19:12.579
ALLOW THE GREAT MEZMERADO
TO GUESS YOUR AGE,

19:12.610 --> 19:13.770
GUESS YOUR WEIGHT.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.219
- OH, YOU KNOW, I'M, UH,

19:15.250 --> 19:16.740
I'M KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING, SO--

19:16.780 --> 19:18.486
- JUST ONE SHOT, MA'AM.
I-I'M REALLY GOOD.

19:18.520 --> 19:20.659
- WE HAVE OUR OWN STUFF
GOING ON.

19:20.690 --> 19:26.481
- JUST ONE SHOT.
IS EVERYONE HERE READY?

19:26.530 --> 19:29.351
- OKAY, FINE.
MAKE IT QUICK.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.459
- 145 POUNDS.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.469
- ONE HUNDRED AND FOR--WHAT?
ARE YOU CRAZY?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.761
- AM I TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW?

19:38.810 --> 19:40.630
THERE SHOULD BE A 3 POUND
MARGIN OF ERROR.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.444
- I HAVE A GUN.
- JULES, JULES.

19:43.480 --> 19:44.777
DON'T SWEAT IT.
LOOK AT HIM.

19:44.810 --> 19:46.607
GUY'S A COMPLETE HACK.
COME ON.

19:46.650 --> 19:49.312
- 133!
- OH, MY GOD.

19:49.350 --> 19:50.487
THAT'S TOTALLY RIGHT.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.385
- MEZMERADO!

19:52.420 --> 19:54.308
[cheers and applause]

19:54.360 --> 19:56.658
- THANKS A LOT, DUDE.
THAT'S GOOD WORK FROM YOU.

19:56.690 --> 19:58.988
FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.248
- WHAT'S UP WITH JULIET?
- NOTHING.

20:01.300 --> 20:03.621
- NOTHING.
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

20:03.670 --> 20:04.967
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, GUS,
I-IT'S TIME FOR ME

20:05.000 --> 20:06.126
TO SHARE SOME NEWS WITH YOU.

20:06.170 --> 20:08.991
YOU'VE PROBABLY FIGURED THIS
OUT FOR YOURSELF ALREADY,

20:09.040 --> 20:11.406
BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED IN
CANADA, SOMETHING REALLY GOOD.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.907
- RIGHT.
WE CAPTURED DESPEREAUX.

20:12.940 --> 20:14.009
- RIGHT. THAT HAPPENED.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.678
BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.

20:15.710 --> 20:17.678
THINGS ARE GONNA BE A LITTLE
DIFFERENT AROUND HERE.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.678
- GREAT. MAYBE YOU'LL START TO
MAKE SENSE SOMETIME SOON.

20:19.710 --> 20:21.769
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.
WE NEED TO TALK.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.640
- LISTEN, SIR,
IT IS ALL IN MY STATEMENT.

20:23.690 --> 20:26.386
WE'RE NEVER SNEAKING INTO
THE HAUNTED HOUSE AGAIN--

20:26.420 --> 20:28.479
IT'S CLEARLY A DANGEROUS...
PLACE.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.750
- WHAT--WHAT CAN WE
DO FOR YOU, MR. HOLLOWAY?

20:30.790 --> 20:32.587
- NOT HERE.

20:36.660 --> 20:38.764
OH, MY GOD, THANK GOD
YOU THINK IT'S RICKETTS TOO.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.791
I-I THOUGHT
I WAS GOING CRAZY.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.637
- YOU'RE NOT GOING CRAZY.

20:42.670 --> 20:43.705
YOU ARE CRAZY.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.401
A GHOST DIDN'T KILL THIS GUY.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.431
- A GOBLIN, POSSIBLY.
MAYBE A VAMPIRE.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.471
- WHO IS THIS JOHNNY RICKETTS
PERSON?

20:49.510 --> 20:51.740
- JOHNNY RICKETTS
WAS A 15-YEAR-OLD KID

20:51.780 --> 20:54.340
WHO FELL FROM THE FERRIS WHEEL
IN 1995.

20:54.380 --> 20:57.349
HE HAD STOPPED AT THE TOP WHILE
OTHER PASSENGERS WERE LOADING

20:57.390 --> 20:59.346
AND HE TRIED TO SWITCH SEATS
OR SOMETHING,

20:59.390 --> 21:01.017
AND HE MISSTEPPED...

21:01.060 --> 21:04.780
AND HE FELL 60 FEET
AND DIED RIGHT THERE.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.855
IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.994
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME
WE DID SCARE FEST.

21:09.030 --> 21:11.021
- UNTIL NOW.
- WELL, THAT'S RIGHT.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.128
I MEAN, WHEN DAVID SAID

21:12.170 --> 21:14.388
THAT HE WANTED US TO DO
SCARE FEST AGAIN, I REFUSED.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.431
I-I JUST DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

21:16.470 --> 21:17.937
BUT THEN...HE INSISTED.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.528
- AND YOU CAVED.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.333
- WELL, THERE WASN'T
REALLY MUCH I COULD SAY.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.870
I MEAN, HE'S THE PRESIDENT,

21:22.910 --> 21:25.071
AND--AND SCARE FEST HAD ALWAYS
BEEN THE BIG MONEY MAKER.

21:25.110 --> 21:26.646
I MEAN, THE PARK
HAD BEEN LOSING MONEY

21:26.680 --> 21:28.614
YEAR AFTER YEAR CONSISTENTLY,

21:28.650 --> 21:30.345
AND HE SAID IF WE DIDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT,

21:30.390 --> 21:31.482
WE WERE GONNA GO UNDER.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.580
SO...WE--WE DID.

21:34.620 --> 21:36.554
EVEN AFTER
IT STARTED HAPPENING.

21:36.590 --> 21:38.956
- AFTER...
WHAT STARTED HAPPENING?

21:38.990 --> 21:42.949
- I STARTED SEEING HIM
I-I-IN WEIRD PLACES

21:43.000 --> 21:46.492
AND HEARING HIM IN MY SLEEP
AND...

21:46.530 --> 21:47.929
THROUGH THE CRACKLING
OF THE PHONE.

21:47.970 --> 21:49.699
- WAYLAN D?
- RICKETTS!

21:49.740 --> 21:52.038
HE'D COME BACK.

21:52.070 --> 21:53.105
HE WAS TRYING
TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

21:53.140 --> 21:55.438
- I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THIS
DUDE WAS TRYING TO SAY.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.538
- [snickers]
- MR. HOLLOWAY,

21:56.580 --> 21:58.775
YOU MAY WANNA CONSIDER
TAKING SOME KIND OF THERAPY.

21:58.810 --> 22:00.414
- I'M SORRY.
ARE YOU SOME SORT OF A DOCTOR?

22:00.450 --> 22:01.940
- NO. BUT I WORK WITH
A LOT OF DOCTORS.

22:01.980 --> 22:03.641
- WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

22:03.690 --> 22:05.783
- ACTUALLY, I-I DO SEE
A THERAPIST.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.082
ONCE A WEEK.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.951
- WELL, MAYBE YOU WANT TO
START DOUBLING THAT UP

22:08.990 --> 22:10.685
AND...CONSIDER TAKING
SOME ANTI-PSYCHOTICS.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.049
I CAN RECOMMEND
A FEW GOOD GENERIC BRANDS.

22:12.090 --> 22:13.728
I MEAN, JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE DELUSIONAL,

22:13.760 --> 22:15.125
THERE'S NO REASON
FOR YOU TO OVERPAY.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.469
- THAT'S ACTUALLY
PRETTY THOUGHTFUL.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.422
- I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU THINK
I'M IMAGINING THIS.

22:19.470 --> 22:20.960
THAT'S WHAT DAVID THOUGHT TOO.
UNTIL HE SAW HIM.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.592
- TILL HE SAW RICKETTS.

22:22.640 --> 22:23.959
- YES! THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.102
THAT'S WHY
I BROUGHT YOU HERE!

22:25.140 --> 22:26.835
RICKETTS HAS BEEN HERE

22:26.870 --> 22:29.577
I-IN THE PARK,
IN THIS OFFICE!

22:29.610 --> 22:31.749
- MAYBE YOU WANT TO CONSIDER
AN IN-HOUSE PROGRAM.

22:31.780 --> 22:33.839
HAVE YOU SEEN GIRL, INTERRUPTED?
- GUS, PLEASE.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.814
HAVE YOU SEEN CUCKOO'S NEST?
OR CRAZY PEOPLE.

22:35.850 --> 22:38.489
- BOAT TRIP.
- BOAT TRI--BOAT TRIP?

22:38.520 --> 22:40.852
THE GAY CRUISE SHIP MOVIE
WITH SANZ AND CUBA GOODING JR.?

22:40.890 --> 22:41.959
HOW DOES THAT PLAY?
- IT DOESN'T.

22:41.990 --> 22:44.083
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
IF ANYONE SAW IT BESIDES ME.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.826
- I'M GUESSING NO.
- YOU SOUND JUST LIKE DAVID DID

22:46.860 --> 22:49.090
BEFORE HE FOUND THIS.

22:49.130 --> 22:51.564
[dramatic music]

22:51.600 --> 22:53.363
both: [shrill scream]

22:55.040 --> 22:57.133
- YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
A GHOST DID THIS, DO YOU?

22:57.170 --> 22:58.706
- GUS, DON'T BE A JURY SUMMONS

22:58.740 --> 23:00.879
I ACCIDENTALLY THREW
IN THE TRASH LAST MONTH

23:00.910 --> 23:02.707
ALONG WITH SOMETHING
CALLED A W2.

23:02.740 --> 23:04.173
IT'S NEVER A GHOST.

23:04.210 --> 23:07.099
HOLLOWAY IS HIDING BEHIND
THE GHOST OF JOHNNY RICKETTS,

23:07.150 --> 23:08.845
BUT WE ALL KNOW GHOSTS
ARE TRANSPARENT.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.416
- IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN SOMETHING?

23:10.450 --> 23:11.986
- IT WAS A VAGUE METAPHOR.
- IT'S CONFUSING.

23:12.020 --> 23:14.181
- MAYBE TO YOU.
- SHAWN, I FIGURED IT OUT.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.415
CONGRATULATE ME.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.826
WE ALSO HAVE SOME INSIGHT
INTO THE WAYLAND MURDER.

23:18.860 --> 23:20.498
- IT'S THE PANTS.
THEY'RE NOT SLIMMING.

23:20.530 --> 23:23.055
THEY'RE LIKE HORIZONTAL STRIPES.
THEY ADD LIKE 10 POUNDS.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.967
- JULES, ARE YOU STILL THINKING
ABOUT THE GUESS YOUR WEIGHT GUY?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.934
- HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT
EVERYBODY ELSE

23:27.970 --> 23:29.437
RIGHT DOWN TO THE POUND.

23:29.470 --> 23:31.108
- IT'S A SHAM, I PROMISE.

23:31.140 --> 23:33.108
LOOK, EVERYONE KNOWS THERE ARE
PLANTS IN THE AUDIENCE.

23:33.140 --> 23:34.835
IT'S A COMPLETE RUSE.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.734
I DON'T EVEN THINK
HIS REAL NAME IS MEZMERADO.

23:36.780 --> 23:38.509
- PRELIMINARY FORENSICS
ARE IN ON WAYLAND.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.848
I'M GOING WITH HOMICIDE.
REPORT'S IN THE FILE.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.939
I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP ON
A WITNESS, THEN WE CAN HEAD OUT.

23:42.980 --> 23:44.516
- LASSIE.

23:44.550 --> 23:47.485
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ADMIT
I WAS RIGHT?

23:47.520 --> 23:48.748
HMM.

23:48.790 --> 23:50.826
- I CHECKED ON JOHNNY RICKETTS
FOR YOU.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.953
- THANK YOU.
- IT WASN'T MUCH.

23:52.990 --> 23:55.652
A FEW ACCOUNTS FROM EMPLOYEES.
HOLLOWAY INCLUDED.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.099
- HOLLOWAY GAVE A STATEMENT?

23:57.130 --> 23:58.791
- YEAH, HE WAS WORKING
THE RIDE THAT NIGHT.

23:58.830 --> 24:00.866
HIS STATEMENT'S PRETTY
CONSISTENT WITH THE OTHERS.

24:00.900 --> 24:03.095
ULTIMATELY, HIS DEATH
WAS RULED ACCIDENTAL,

24:03.140 --> 24:04.004
AND THE PARK
WASN'T HELD LIABLE.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.838
BUT THEY NEVER HELD
SCARE FEST AGAIN.

24:06.870 --> 24:10.169
[choking sounds]

24:11.750 --> 24:13.718
- CLYDE, LUGS, AND PEMBROOK!

24:13.750 --> 24:14.910
JOHNNY RICKETTS
DID KILL WAYLAND.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.577
- DID YOU JUST USE THE
CHARACTERS FROM STROKER ACE

24:16.620 --> 24:18.588
AS AN INTERJECTION?
- DON'T INTERRUPT.

24:18.620 --> 24:20.759
- BUT YOU DID USE STROKER ACE.
- I CAN'T DO THIS

24:20.790 --> 24:22.587
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW--
I GOTTA...

24:22.620 --> 24:24.781
- WHEN THEY TOLD US THAT WE
WERE GONNA DO SCARE FEST AGAIN,

24:24.830 --> 24:26.752
I REFUSED--
IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT.

24:26.790 --> 24:28.553
BUT HE INSISTED!

24:28.600 --> 24:31.262
AND THERE'S NOT MUCH I CAN SAY.
HE'S THE PRESIDENT.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.790
- IT WASN'T RICKETTS.

24:32.830 --> 24:35.037
IT WAS HOLLOWAY
POSING AS RICKETTS.

24:35.070 --> 24:37.038
SEE, WAYLAND WAS RUNNING
THE PARK INTO THE GROUND.

24:37.070 --> 24:39.834
HOLLOWAY WANTED TO TAKE OVER,
SO HE KILLED WAYLAND

24:39.870 --> 24:41.531
AND PINNED IT ON THE GHOST
OF JOHNNY RICKETTS.

24:41.580 --> 24:42.808
- YOU JUST SAID
IT'S NEVER A GHOST.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.000
IT'S NEVER A GHOST.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

24:44.050 --> 24:45.108
WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME?

24:45.150 --> 24:46.674
- I AM.
YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

24:46.710 --> 24:49.213
- YOUR FACE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
- LET'S GO.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.287
- EVE! WHERE'S HOLLOWAY?
- HE'S NOT HERE.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.258
AND THEN HE JUST WALKED OFF,

24:59.290 --> 25:01.121
MADE A BEELINE
FOR THE FLUME RIDE.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.867
- FLUME RIDE.
- WE NEED TO SEE HIM NOW.

25:03.900 --> 25:05.765
'SCUSE US, 'SCUSE US,
'SCUSE US.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.893
COME ON, GUS!

25:16.780 --> 25:17.769
- IT'S CRAZY.

25:17.810 --> 25:20.608
HE JUST RACED UP THE STAIRS
AND INTO THE RIDE

25:20.650 --> 25:21.742
WHILE IT WAS STILL RUNNING.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.645
- WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.888
I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

25:37.330 --> 25:38.888
- DUDE.

25:38.930 --> 25:41.535
THAT'S JOHNNY RICKETTS!

25:49.110 --> 25:51.044
- WE ARE TWO HOMICIDES DEEP
ON THIS CASE,

25:51.080 --> 25:52.604
AND IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK.

25:52.650 --> 25:53.947
WE'VE EXECUTED A POLICE ORDER

25:53.980 --> 25:55.675
TO TEMPORARILY
SHUT DOWN THE PARK.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.745
WE'RE SEEKING INFORMATION
ON THIS SUSPECT.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.348
WE'RE GONNA BE SCOURING
THE DESIGNATED AREA

25:59.390 --> 26:00.709
IN TWO-MAN TEAMS.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.115
WE ARE GOING TO
SNIFF OUT THIS REPROBATE

26:03.160 --> 26:05.025
AND CUFF HIM WHERE HE STANDS.

26:05.060 --> 26:06.186
NOW, LET'S GO.

26:10.130 --> 26:13.634
- THAT WAS AN EXQUISITE
BRIEFING, DETECTIVE.

26:13.670 --> 26:14.864
BEAUTIFULLY ENUNCIATED.

26:14.900 --> 26:16.765
YOU ARE AN ARTISTE

26:16.800 --> 26:18.609
AND BRIEF'S YOUR MEDIUM.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.972
THOUGH I SUSPECT YOU COULD
SQUEEZE INTO A SMALL

26:21.010 --> 26:22.238
IF YOU HAD TO.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.975
- THANK YOU, SPENCER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

26:24.010 --> 26:25.375
EVEN YOUR COMPLIMENTS
ARE INSULTS.

26:25.410 --> 26:27.105
- I SURE HOPE ALL THAT
SCOURING YOU SPOKE OF

26:27.150 --> 26:28.742
INVOLVES GUS AND MYSELF.

26:28.780 --> 26:30.316
- YOU KNOW,
NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT,

26:30.350 --> 26:32.682
THERE IS SOMETHING
I'M NEEDING FROM YOU TWO.

26:32.720 --> 26:33.687
- WHAT?

26:33.720 --> 26:36.188
- YOUR ABSENCE.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.082
- WOW.
- I KNOW.

26:40.130 --> 26:42.826
- HOW LONG DO YOU THINK HE'S
BEEN WAITING TO USE THAT ONE?

26:42.860 --> 26:45.294
- WEEKS.
MAYBE MONTHS.

26:47.270 --> 26:49.795
COME ON, GUS...SOMEONE AROUND
HERE'S BOUND TO KNOW SOMETHING.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.307
- THERE'S HARDLY
ANYONE HERE, SHAWN.

26:51.340 --> 26:53.228
LASSITER SHUT THE PARK DOWN.
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,

26:53.270 --> 26:55.670
I THINK WE SHOULD
FIND OURSELVES A FUNNEL CAKE.

26:55.710 --> 26:57.234
KEN!

26:57.280 --> 27:00.169
HARD AT WORK, I SEE.

27:00.210 --> 27:03.373
- YEAH. THEY KEPT A FEW OF US
AROUND FOR THE CLEANUP.

27:03.420 --> 27:05.638
- WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE
THAT YOU'RE STILL WORKING.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.908
- I'M DONE TONIGHT.
- SORRY TO HEAR THAT, KEN.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.916
IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO...
- REALLY?

27:09.960 --> 27:11.325
WELL, HOW ABOUT FINDING ME
ANOTHER JOB

27:11.360 --> 27:13.351
AND THEN GETTING ME FIRED?
WE CAN GO FOR THE TRIFECTA!

27:13.390 --> 27:15.392
- COME ON, NOW, KEN.
- NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:15.430 --> 27:16.897
I GET IT NOW, SHAWN.

27:16.930 --> 27:18.693
IT'S NOT THAT YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO WORK FOR YOU.

27:18.730 --> 27:19.890
IT'S THAT YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO WORK AT ALL.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.660
- KEN, WE'RE SERIOUS...YOU
CALL US IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

27:22.700 --> 27:23.769
- EXCEPT FOR A JOB.
- MAYBE A JOB.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.028
_ - WE'RE NOT HIRING.
- [whlsper] WE MIGHT BE HIRING.

27:26.070 --> 27:28.675
- WE'RE A LITTLE UNDERFUNDED IN
THE HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT.

27:28.710 --> 27:30.029
- LOOK, YOU GUYS MIND
IF I GET BACK TO WORK?

27:30.080 --> 27:31.399
- WE'D LOVE FOR YOU
TO GET BACK TO WORK.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.247
- AS LONG AS WE'RE NOT
THE ONES EMPLOYING YOU.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.111
- BUT FIRST...
CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT

27:35.150 --> 27:36.742
THIS NASTY
JOHNNY RICKETTS BUSINESS?

27:36.780 --> 27:38.987
- WHO?
- JOHNNY RICKETTS.

27:39.020 --> 27:41.250
KID WHO DIED ON THE FERRIS WHEEL
BACK IN '95.

27:41.290 --> 27:42.848
- OH, YEAH.
I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

27:42.890 --> 27:44.323
YEAH, MY PARENTS
WERE TALKING ABOUT IT

27:44.360 --> 27:45.850
WHEN THEY WERE
CHANGING MY DIAPERS.

27:45.890 --> 27:47.994
- GUS, IS THERE ANYTHING
CUTER THAN A CHINESE BABY?

27:48.030 --> 27:50.157
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,
SHAWN?

27:50.200 --> 27:51.724
- WE THINK THAT RICKETTS
IS CONNECTED

27:51.770 --> 27:53.829
TO BOTH WAYLAND'S
AND HOLLOWAY'S DEATHS.

27:53.870 --> 27:55.098
- WHY ARE YOU GUYS
EVEN ASKING ME?

27:55.140 --> 27:57.028
I'VE WORKED HERE
FOR EXACTLY FOUR DAYS.

27:57.070 --> 27:58.799
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT THIS PLACE,

27:58.840 --> 28:00.728
WHY DON'T YOU LOOK
IN THE ARCHIVES OR SOMETHING?

28:00.780 --> 28:02.270
THEY DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.

28:06.780 --> 28:08.873
- I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO LOOK.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.888
COME ON, KEN.
WE'LL NEED SOMEONE TO GET US IN.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.239
- REALLY, SHAWN?
I'M ALREADY FIRED.

28:12.290 --> 28:13.848
YOU WANNA GET ME DOUBLE-FIRED?

28:13.890 --> 28:15.858
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
- SERIOUSLY, DUDE.

28:15.890 --> 28:17.187
YOU NEED HELP.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.120
Lassiter: STATE AGENCY?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKIN' AT?

28:19.160 --> 28:20.855
- DOESN'T IT STRIKE YOU
AS ODD

28:20.900 --> 28:22.720
THAT THERE APPEAR TO BE
NO STATE INVESTIGATION

28:22.760 --> 28:23.829
INTO RICKETT'S DEATH?

28:23.870 --> 28:25.792
- IT WAS RULED AN ACCIDENT.
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.195
- YEAH, YEAH--BY THE PARK.

28:27.230 --> 28:29.232
THERE WAS NO OFFICIAL REPORT
RELEASED BY THE STATE,

28:29.270 --> 28:30.737
AND THEY ALWAYS LOOK INTO
THESE THINGS.

28:30.770 --> 28:32.431
- LOOK, O'HARA,
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

28:32.470 --> 28:34.836
- I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT IT DOES SEEM PECULIAR.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.199
MAYBE SHAWN'S RIGHT.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.946
- [laughs] ABOUT WHAT?
HE AND GUSTER THINK

28:37.980 --> 28:39.743
THEY'RE IN SOME CARTOON
MYSTERY SHOW

28:39.780 --> 28:41.042
WITH A TALKING GREAT DANE

28:41.080 --> 28:42.775
AND A PSYCHEDELICALLY
PAINTED VAN.

28:42.820 --> 28:44.139
- SCOOBY- DOO?

28:44.190 --> 28:46.249
- IS THAT WHY HE KEEPS
CALLING ME VELMA?

28:46.290 --> 28:47.382
- AH, PROBABLY.

28:47.420 --> 28:48.512
- OH.

28:48.560 --> 28:49.515
WELL, THE POINT IS

28:49.560 --> 28:51.482
THERE IS A FLESH AND BLOOD
KILLER OUT THERE.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.327
WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND HIM
LOOKING IN OLD FILES.

28:53.360 --> 28:55.157
- DON'T HAVE TO LECTURE ME
ON POLICE WORK, CARLTON.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.259
- I KNOW. YOU'RE THE SECOND-BEST
DETECTIVE WE HAVE...

28:57.300 --> 28:58.494
BY A WIDE MARGIN.

28:58.530 --> 29:00.191
- UM...THANK YOU?

29:00.230 --> 29:01.458
- AND THAT'S BECAUSE,
UP UNTIL NOW,

29:01.500 --> 29:04.207
YOU'VE MANAGED TO KEEP SPENCER
AND HIS ANTICS AT ARM'S LENGTH.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.458
SEE, THAT IS THE KEY
TO DEALING WITH HIM.

29:06.510 --> 29:07.431
THAT AND MAINTAINING

29:07.470 --> 29:09.870
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL UPPER HAND
AT ALL TIMES.

29:09.910 --> 29:12.174
- HE'S CALLING YOU VELMA.
- I'M CHOOSING MY BATTLES.

29:12.210 --> 29:14.144
- SO AM I.
- REALLY? BECAUSE LATELY...

29:14.180 --> 29:16.273
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE BACKING HIM
A LITTLE MORE THAN USUAL.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.515
- I AM BEHIND HIM EXACTLY
AS MUCH AS I NEED TO BE.

29:18.550 --> 29:20.518
HE HAS SOLVED
A LOT OF CASES FOR US.

29:20.550 --> 29:22.188
DON'T YOU SEE THAT?

29:22.220 --> 29:24.154
- YOU TELLING ME
WHAT I SHOULD SEE?

29:24.190 --> 29:26.351
- YOU SEE YOUR PARTNER
FOLLOWING A LEAD.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.926
- FROM SPENCER.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.325
- IT'S ALL POLICE WORK,
CARLTON.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.021
- RIGHT.
AND GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.163
- GLOBAL WARNING IS REAL.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.464
- SURE, IT IS.
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING

29:35.500 --> 29:38.537
IS THAT IT'S FINE THAT
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM...

29:38.570 --> 29:40.936
AS LONG AS WE'RE
ON THE SAME TEAM.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.379
- DIDN'T I JUST SAY
I'M YOUR PARTNER?

29:42.410 --> 29:44.275
- YES.
- THEN YOU HAVE NOTHING

29:44.310 --> 29:45.846
TO WORRY ABOUT.
- GOOD.

29:45.880 --> 29:46.801
BECAUSE LISTENING TO SPENCER'S

29:46.850 --> 29:49.216
ALMOST ALWAYS A TRIP
DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE.

29:52.620 --> 29:56.886
[grunting sounds]

30:04.070 --> 30:05.128
[thud]

30:06.400 --> 30:07.424
- YOU SEE?

30:07.470 --> 30:09.859
I TOLD YOU YOU COULD SQUEEZE
THROUGH THIS WINDOW.

30:09.900 --> 30:12.039
- WHY DO I ALWAYS
HAVE TO DO IT FIRST?

30:12.070 --> 30:14.038
GIMME A HAND.

30:19.180 --> 30:21.614
LET'S NOT MAKE THIS A THING.
YOU CAN GO FIRST NEXT TIME.

30:21.650 --> 30:24.949
- I D GO FIRST.
- THEN WHY ARE YOU COMPLAINING?

30:30.990 --> 30:33.356
UH, ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR

30:33.390 --> 30:36.029
ANY KIND OF DOCUMENTATION
FROM THE NIGHT RICKETTS DIED.

30:36.060 --> 30:37.618
- JULIET SHOWED US
THE DOCUMENTATION.

30:37.660 --> 30:40.094
- NOT ALL OF IT.

30:43.240 --> 30:45.561
WELL, GO SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
ANYTHING IN HOLLOWAY'S OFFICE.

30:45.610 --> 30:47.407
- I'M NOT GOING THROUGH
A DEAD MAN'S OFFICE.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.874
- IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S GONNA
WALK IN OR SOMETHING.

30:49.910 --> 30:51.047
- SEE IF YOU CAN FIND
OUR STATEMENTS.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.479
- WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?

30:52.510 --> 30:54.546
- FOR YOUR INFORMATION, SHAWN,

30:54.580 --> 30:56.878
I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW
MY RECORD IS SPOTLESS.

30:56.920 --> 31:00.014
I MAY RUN FOR OFFICE SOMEDAY.

31:00.050 --> 31:01.381
FINE.

31:32.250 --> 31:34.889
- OH, BOY.

31:35.960 --> 31:38.326
- [crunching]

31:38.360 --> 31:39.987
- GUS.

31:40.030 --> 31:41.395
CHECK IT OUT.

31:41.430 --> 31:45.025
EVE WAS HERE
THE NIGHT RICKETTS DIED.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.095
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?
- NOTHING.

31:48.470 --> 31:50.461
- YOU DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH
A DEAD MAN'S OFFICE,

31:50.500 --> 31:52.536
BUT YOU'LL EAT HIS CANDY?
- IT'S GRANDMA CANDY, SHAWN.

31:52.570 --> 31:54.401
NOBODY'S GONNA WANT IT.
- IT'S SO SHINY.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.237
LOOK HOW SHINY
THE ORANGE ONE IS--

31:56.280 --> 31:58.009
- WHAT DID YOU FIND, SHAWN?

31:58.050 --> 32:00.075
- HOLLOWAY MADE EVE
FALSIFY HER STATEMENTS.

32:00.110 --> 32:02.044
IT'S HER HAND
BUT NOT HER HANDWRITING.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.616
CHECK OUT THE 85.

32:03.650 --> 32:06.539
NOW LOOK AT THE 8 IN THE DATE
NEXT TO HER SIGNATURE.

32:06.590 --> 32:07.579
BOOM.

32:07.620 --> 32:09.611
- WOW.
- WHAT?

32:09.660 --> 32:11.685
- ALL RIGHT--

32:11.730 --> 32:13.129
WAIT A SECOND.
- WHAT?

32:13.160 --> 32:14.297
- WHAT IS THIS?

32:14.330 --> 32:15.991
- YOU KNOW I DON'T SPEAK
ALGEBRA.

32:16.030 --> 32:17.554
- IT'S A MONEY TRANSFER.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.626
$350,000...
RIGHT AFTER THE INCIDENT.

32:20.670 --> 32:24.208
- WHAT IS IT, A FINE?
AND WHO DID IT GO TO?

32:24.240 --> 32:26.504
- JOHNNY RICKETTS' FAMILY.

32:26.540 --> 32:28.633
- HOLLOWAY MUST HAVE
PAID 'EM OFF.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.329
LITTLE HALLOWEEN HUSH MONEY.

32:30.380 --> 32:32.575
- THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT, SHAWN.

32:32.610 --> 32:36.046
- WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.310
MAYBE THEY ASKED FOR MORE.
- NO, NO.

32:38.350 --> 32:40.682
NO, THIS IS GOING
TO SOMEONE DIFFERENT.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.188
JAIME EMERSON.

32:43.220 --> 32:44.585
- JAIME...EMERSON.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.586
WHAT IS WONDER WOMAN'S
REAL NAME?

32:46.630 --> 32:47.426
[door closes]

32:49.330 --> 32:50.729
WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU HIDING FOR?

32:50.760 --> 32:53.991
- WE BROKE INTO
SOMEONE'S OFFICE, SHAWN.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.395
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING IN HERE?

32:56.440 --> 32:58.203
DID YOU JUST BREAK INTO
OUR OFFICE?

32:58.240 --> 32:59.639
- NO.
- WHY WOULD YOU ASK THAT?

32:59.670 --> 33:01.274
BECAUSE HE'S BLACK?

33:01.310 --> 33:03.301
- SORRY?
- EVE, I'M A PSYCHIC.

33:03.340 --> 33:05.672
WE WORK FOR THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

33:05.710 --> 33:07.701
AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A SECRET.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.718
A DARK SECRET.

33:09.750 --> 33:11.445
THE SAME SECRET THAT WAYLAND
AND HOLLOWAY

33:11.490 --> 33:13.082
TOOK TO THEIR GRAVES.

33:13.120 --> 33:16.715
I WAS DRAWN HERE...
BY JAIME EMERSON.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.751
- WHERE DID YOU GET
THAT NAME?

33:20.460 --> 33:22.724
- WE KNOW ABOUT THE PAYOUTS.

33:22.760 --> 33:25.558
THE PAYOUTS AFTER RICKETTS
DIED ON THE FERRIS WHEEL.

33:25.600 --> 33:27.568
- I WARNED THEM.

33:27.600 --> 33:31.036
THE DECORATIONS WERE IN THE WAY.
THE DOOR DIDN'T CLOSE RIGHT.

33:31.070 --> 33:33.300
- WE KNOW YOU PAID
JAIME EMERSON OFF TOO.

33:33.340 --> 33:35.228
WHY?
WAS SHE THERE THAT NIGHT?

33:35.280 --> 33:37.271
WAS SHE A REPORTER,
AN EMPLOYEE, WHAT?

33:39.250 --> 33:41.571
EVE, YOU CAN'T
RUN AWAY FROM THIS.

33:43.350 --> 33:45.045
THAT WAS A STRANGE REACTION.

33:49.490 --> 33:52.186
- NO DEATH CERTIFICATE.
NO ARREST RECORD.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.824
JAIME EMERSON IS THE GHOST,
NOT JOHNNY RICKETTS.

33:54.860 --> 33:57.192
- DUDE, DID YOU JUST
RUB MY LEG?

33:57.230 --> 33:58.788
- WHAT?
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

33:58.830 --> 34:00.718
I RUB YOU, IT'S GONNA BE
ABOVE THE FOREHEAD.

34:00.770 --> 34:02.397
YOU MUST HAVE RUBBED
YOUR OWN LEG.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.737
- WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

34:03.770 --> 34:04.702
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING
ABOUT YOUR QUADS.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.765
- I AM NOT!
I DO NOT TALK ABOUT MY QUADS.

34:06.810 --> 34:08.334
- SHAWN, JUST TELL HIM.
- WHAT--TELL--WHAT--

34:08.380 --> 34:09.369
THAT'S TOO WEIRD.

34:09.410 --> 34:10.672
- WEIRDER THAN
RUBBING HIS QUADS?

34:10.710 --> 34:12.439
- WHAT ARE YOU ALL
TALKING ABOUT?

34:12.480 --> 34:13.640
- NOTHING.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.773
- JULIET HAS REQUESTED
DMV INFORMATION

34:15.820 --> 34:18.118
ON JAIME EMERSON.

34:18.150 --> 34:19.617
- JULES, YOU BROUGHT MY DAD
IN ON THIS?

34:19.650 --> 34:20.787
- DESPITE ALL APPEARANCES,
SHAWN,

34:20.820 --> 34:22.287
WE DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE
YOU'RE CRAZY.

34:22.320 --> 34:25.289
- NO DRIVER'S LICENSE.
JUST A CALIFORNIA I.D.

34:25.330 --> 34:28.299
- YEAH. SHE'S NOT ALLOWED
TO DRIVE BECAUSE OF AN INJURY.

34:33.270 --> 34:34.589
- SHE WAS THERE THAT NIGHT.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.528
AND SHE'S TAKING THEM OUT
ONE BY ONE.

34:36.570 --> 34:38.435
- WHO'S TAKING WHO OUT?
- JOHNNY RICKETTS.

34:38.470 --> 34:39.869
I MEAN, NOT THE REAL
JOHNNY RI--

34:39.910 --> 34:41.605
IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE
JOHNNY RICKETTS.

34:41.640 --> 34:43.471
- SHAWN...
YOU'RE NOT MAKING SENSE.

34:43.510 --> 34:46.399
- DAD, JOHNNY RICKETTS WAS NOT
ALONE ON THE FERRIS WHEEL

34:46.450 --> 34:47.576
THAT NIGHT THAT HE DIED.

34:47.610 --> 34:49.612
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.
IT WAS NEGLIGENCE.

34:49.650 --> 34:51.789
AND EVERYONE WHO WAS THERE
IS GOING DOWN.

34:51.820 --> 34:53.685
- EVERYONE WHO WAS THERE
IS DEAD.

34:57.490 --> 35:00.618
EVE, YOU CAN'T
RUN AWAY FROM THIS.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.422
- EVERYONE BUT EVE.

35:03.460 --> 35:05.166
WE HAVE TO GET
TO THE FAIRGROUNDS!

35:05.200 --> 35:07.361
- I'M GONNA GET LASSITER.
STAY PUT.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.890
- ARE WE REALLY WAITING
FOR LASSITER?

35:08.940 --> 35:10.692
- THAT WOULD BE A FIRST.

35:18.780 --> 35:20.338
- EVE!

35:20.380 --> 35:22.439
- EVE'
- EVE!

35:24.420 --> 35:25.910
EVE!

35:25.950 --> 35:29.158
AH...I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
WE MIGHT BE TOO LATE.

35:29.190 --> 35:30.885
- DO YOU THINK EVE
IS STILL HERE?

35:30.920 --> 35:32.421
- EVE!

35:32.460 --> 35:33.620
- EVE!

35:33.660 --> 35:34.695
[clang]

35:34.730 --> 35:37.858
[power-up hum,
music starts]

35:37.900 --> 35:40.824
*

35:40.870 --> 35:44.761
- HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH HAH!

35:47.940 --> 35:49.168
- EVE'
- EVE!

35:49.210 --> 35:50.404
EVE!

35:50.440 --> 35:51.577
- DUDE!

35:51.610 --> 35:53.942
- EVE?
- EVE.

35:53.980 --> 35:55.675
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- A-ARE YOU OKAY?

35:55.720 --> 35:58.814
- [whimpers] OH, I...
I'VE SEEN HIM!

35:58.850 --> 36:00.715
RICKETTS.
- WE KNOW.

36:00.750 --> 36:03.685
- NO, NO, NO, NOT JUST TONIGHT.
I'VE BEEN SEEING HIM FOR WEEKS.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.426
I COULDN'T ADMIT IT.
I...FELT SO GUILTY.

36:05.460 --> 36:07.223
- YOU DIDN'T SEE
JOHNNY RICKETTS.

36:07.260 --> 36:09.296
- I'D WAKE UP AT NIGHT,
AND I'D SEE HIM OUT MY WINDOW.

36:09.330 --> 36:11.389
I'D HEAR HIS VOICE OVER
MY PHONE--I KNOW WHO I SEE!

36:11.430 --> 36:12.260
- I KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE HIM,

36:12.300 --> 36:13.790
BUT YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
SEEING RICKETTS.

36:13.830 --> 36:16.264
- THEN WHO DO I SEE?
- YOU--

36:17.700 --> 36:20.567
TURN AROUND.
BUT BE VERY CAREFUL.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.674
- CAROL.

36:23.710 --> 36:25.905
- YOU CAN CALL HER
BY HER REAL NAME.

36:25.950 --> 36:29.579
JAIME EMERSON.

36:29.620 --> 36:31.315
- YOU WERE THE GIRL.

36:31.350 --> 36:34.319
OH, HONEY, I AM SO SORRY.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.988
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
SHE WAS ON THAT RIDE TOO.

36:37.020 --> 36:40.285
JOHNNY WASN'T SCREWING AROUND
ON THE FERRIS WHEEL THAT NIGHT.

36:40.330 --> 36:41.752
- HE WAS TRYING TO HELP ME.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.223
- THE LATCH WASN'T SAFE.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.897
YOU BOTH FELL.

36:49.370 --> 36:51.759
YOU SURVIVED...
HE DIDN'T.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.571
THE PARK KNEW THEY WERE
LIABLE FOR THE ACCIDENT.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.599
- YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.448
MR. WAYLAND
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BEST.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.674
- TO KEEP IT SHUT?

37:02.720 --> 37:04.915
YOU'VE HAD 15 YEARS
TO COME CLEAN!

37:04.950 --> 37:08.454
- THEY PAID OFF ALL THE PARENTS
FOR THEIR SILENCE...

37:08.490 --> 37:12.449
350 GRAND FOR EACH,
AND IT WAS OVER FOR THEM.

37:12.490 --> 37:13.923
MAY HAVE COVERED
YOUR MEDICAL EXPENSES,

37:13.960 --> 37:14.858
BUT NOT YOUR SUFFERING.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.949
AND NOTHING WAS GONNA
BRING JOHNNY BACK.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.663
AND NOW, WHEN THEY DECIDED
TO BRING BACK SCARE FEST,

37:21.700 --> 37:23.895
SO CALLOUSLY FORGETTING
ALL THE DAMAGE

37:23.940 --> 37:26.306
THEY LEFT IN THEIR WAKE,

37:26.340 --> 37:28.831
YOU SNAPPED.

37:28.880 --> 37:29.938
ANYONE WOULD HAVE.

37:31.980 --> 37:33.538
EVE AND HOLLOWAY KEPT THINKING

37:33.580 --> 37:36.617
THEY WERE SEEING
JOHNNY RICKETTS.

37:36.650 --> 37:40.313
BUT WHAT THEY REALLY SAW
WAS YOU IN A BASEBALL CAP.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.610
AND YOU DIDN'T
JUST WANT TO KILL THEM.

37:43.660 --> 37:45.423
YOU WANTED A PREAMBLE

37:45.460 --> 37:49.829
SO THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHY
THEY WERE BEING KILLED.

37:49.860 --> 37:51.760
- I NEVER WANTED YOUR MONEY.

37:54.600 --> 37:55.965
- THEY MADE ME LIE!

37:56.000 --> 37:57.797
I HAVE REGRETTED IT
EVER SINCE!

37:57.840 --> 38:00.035
- YOU CAN SAY
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.573
YOU'RE STILL GOING
WITH THEM.

38:02.610 --> 38:03.872
- KNIFE!

38:09.680 --> 38:10.647
[cocks trigger]

38:10.680 --> 38:12.682
[pop]
- AH!

38:14.460 --> 38:16.815
- GRAB IT!
GRAB IT!

38:19.430 --> 38:21.694
JAIME, LET IT BE OVER.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.665
THE ONLY THING
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT IS

38:24.700 --> 38:26.429
HOW YOU WERE IN TWO PLACES
AT THE SAME TIME.

38:26.470 --> 38:27.619
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:27.670 --> 38:28.989
- HOW DID SHE MANAGE
TO OPERATE THE RIDE

38:29.040 --> 38:31.736
AND KILL WAYLAND
AT THE SAME TIME, GUS?

38:31.770 --> 38:33.909
- ABRACADABRA.

38:33.940 --> 38:35.874
- NEVER MIND.
I THINK I GOT IT.

38:35.910 --> 38:37.969
- I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE A LITTLE
FREAKED OUT RIGHT NOW,

38:38.010 --> 38:39.602
BUT IF YOU'LL NOTICE
THE SIGN OUTSIDE,

38:39.650 --> 38:40.639
IT SAYS THE WORD SPOOKY.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.443
- TODD, RIGHT?
TODD?

38:42.480 --> 38:44.584
B-I-T

38:44.620 --> 38:46.440
C-H-I-N'.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.118
YOU FORGOT THE "T".
WHAT YOU TEXTED WAS BI-CHIN.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.787
- WAIT A SECOND.

38:50.820 --> 38:52.048
YOU'RE THE GUESS
YOUR WEIGHT GUY.

38:52.090 --> 38:54.081
YOU DRESSED UP
AS RICKETTS TOO?

38:54.130 --> 38:55.552
- YEAH, THEY BOTH DID.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.818
TO KEEP THE MEMORY
OF JOHNNY RICKETTS ALIVE

38:57.860 --> 38:59.566
TO THE PEOPLE
THEY BLAMED FOR HIS DEATH.

38:59.600 --> 39:00.828
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO NOW,
BABE?

39:00.870 --> 39:02.690
WE CAN'T KILL TWO MORE.
- WE HAVE TO.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.436
- WE GOTTA GO.
- LET'S GET OUTTA HERE!

39:05.470 --> 39:07.609
- GET THEM!

39:19.420 --> 39:22.878
- HERE. COME ON, EVE.
SHH, SHH, SHH!

39:24.760 --> 39:27.729
GUS, SEEING AS HOW WE MIGHT
BE DYING AT ANY MOMENT,

39:27.760 --> 39:29.694
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

39:29.730 --> 39:31.925
REMEMBER WHEN YOU GOT BUMMED OUT
WHEN I STARTED SEEING ABIGAIL?

39:31.970 --> 39:33.858
YOU THOUGHT THINGS BETWEEN US
WERE GONNA CHANGE,

39:33.900 --> 39:35.697
AND YOU ATE ALL THOSE WAFFLES
TO TRY AND DEAL WITH IT?

39:35.740 --> 39:37.537
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, SHAWN?

39:37.570 --> 39:39.037
- I DON'T THINK THIS IS
REALLY THE TIME FOR THIS.

39:39.070 --> 39:40.958
- I HOOKED UP WITH JULIET.
- SO?

39:41.010 --> 39:42.705
- SO? WE'RE BREAKING UP
THE DUO.

39:42.740 --> 39:44.446
IT'S NOT JUST SHAWN
AND GUS ANYMORE.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.845
NOW IT'S MORE LIKE
THE SAY SAY SAY VIDEO.

39:45.880 --> 39:47.507
- YOU'VE BEEN AFTER HER
FOR FIVE YEARS.

39:47.550 --> 39:49.677
- FIVE YEARS?
- HE'S REALLY NOT THAT SMOOTH.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.712
- OH, I'M NOT THAT SMOOTH?
"HEY, YOU HEAR ABOUT PLUTO?

39:52.750 --> 39:54.752
THAT'S MESSED UP, RIGHT?"
HOW MANY TIMES HAS THAT LANDED?

39:54.790 --> 39:56.587
- GUYS, GUYS.
- THAT'S A PLAYER'S MOVE, SHAWN.

39:56.620 --> 39:58.429
- IT'S NOT A PLAYER'S MOVE.

39:58.460 --> 40:00.018
THAT'S LIKE
AN ASTRONOMER'S MOVE.

40:00.060 --> 40:02.597
LOOK, JULES AND I
ARE AN ITEM NOW.

40:02.630 --> 40:04.518
THE LEAST YOU CAN DO
IS SHOW SOME EMOTION.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.492
- WAIT A SECOND--YOU'RE MAD
AT ME FOR NOT BEING MAD?

40:06.530 --> 40:07.997
- I'M SHOCKED AT YOU
FOR NOT BEING SHOCKED.

40:08.030 --> 40:09.588
AND I'D LIKE YOU TO BE
A LITTLE SAD,

40:09.640 --> 40:11.062
'CAUSE I'M A LITTLE SAD.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.761
- WHAT DO YOU CARE
WHAT YOU FRIEND THINKS?

40:12.810 --> 40:15.176
- YOU KNOW WHAT, EVE?
I DON'T CARE.

40:15.210 --> 40:17.075
I-I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T CARE.

40:17.110 --> 40:20.170
- HEY. WE GOT
A BIG PROBLEM HERE.

40:20.210 --> 40:23.077
- ASK ME HOW MUCH
I DON'T CARE, TODD.

40:23.120 --> 40:24.917
- I CARE, TODD.
I CARE.

40:24.950 --> 40:26.542
- YOU CARE ABOUT TODD
AND HIS LITTLE GUN?

40:26.590 --> 40:27.614
- YES. YES, I DO, SHAWN.

40:27.650 --> 40:29.789
- YOUR PRIORITIES ARE WAY
OUT OF WHACK, MY FRIEND.

40:29.820 --> 40:32.129
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU GUYS?

40:32.160 --> 40:33.229
- BOOM!

40:33.260 --> 40:34.522
[thud]

40:34.560 --> 40:36.926
- 145 POUNDS, MY ASS!

40:38.100 --> 40:40.523
- I GOT THE TINY GIRL
WITH THE LIMP.

40:40.570 --> 40:41.969
- NICE, LASSIE.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.468
- WELL, IT'S EASY.
SHE...SHE DOESN'T RUN VERY FAST.

40:44.510 --> 40:46.068
- REALLY GOOD WORK.

40:46.110 --> 40:49.705
WE'LL FINISH
THIS CONVERSATION LATER.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.480
- JULES, I WON'T LIE TO YOU.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.954
IT WAS DIFFICULT, BUT I FINALLY
TOLD GUS ABOUT US.

41:02.990 --> 41:05.550
- AND HOW DID HE TAKE IT?
- SHOCK AND BEWILDERMENT.

41:05.590 --> 41:07.182
- HMM.
- LIKE THE FIRST SIX MINUTES

41:07.230 --> 41:09.050
OF SAVING PRIVATE RYAN...

41:09.100 --> 41:11.728
FOLLOWED BY THE LAST FIVE
MINUTES OF LADY IN THE WATER.

41:11.770 --> 41:12.919
- NO, IT WASN'T.

41:12.970 --> 41:15.097
I TOTALLY SAW IT COMING,
JUST LIKE LADY IN THE WATER.

41:15.140 --> 41:16.789
- SURE, YOU DID.

41:16.840 --> 41:19.104
NOW YOU GONNA TELL US THE SAME
THING ABOUT PRIVATE RYAN?

41:19.140 --> 41:21.506
- THE NORMANDY INVASION?
YEAH, I KNEW THAT ONE TOO.

41:21.540 --> 41:23.633
- LIAR.
- IT'S A HISTORICAL FACT.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.773
- MAYBE TO YOU.
- MAYBE TO THE 20TH CENTURY.

41:25.810 --> 41:27.277
- LOOK, THE IMPORTANT THING

41:27.310 --> 41:29.574
IS THAT IT IS NOW
OUT IN THE OPEN.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.269
NO MORE SNEAKING AROUND.
NO MORE SECRETS.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.141
- I ABSOLUTELY AGREE.
NO MORE SECRETS, JULES.

41:34.190 --> 41:36.158
EXCEPT FROM LASSITER.

41:36.190 --> 41:38.727
WHICH MEANS GUS CAN COME CLEAN
ABOUT HOW SHOCKED HE WAS.

41:38.760 --> 41:40.625
- I WASN'T SHOCKED.
- YOU WILL BE.

41:40.660 --> 41:43.254
- PRETTY SURE I WON'T.

41:43.300 --> 41:45.666
- HE'S PLAYING IT COOL.
- MM.

41:45.700 --> 41:48.635
- MAYBE I WAS WRONG.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.268
HEY!

41:51.300 --> 41:54.098
ARE YOU EATING CARAMEL
IN THERE?

41:54.140 --> 41:57.132
