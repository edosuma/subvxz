Hell yeah!

00:15.584 --> 00:20.864
That's it? I guess I gotta
pull out the big guns.

00:22.207 --> 00:24.886
Hey! What the hell do
you think you're doing?

00:24.887 --> 00:29.120
Huh? Fishing, dumbass! I'm
Firecracker Jim, God damn it!

00:29.121 --> 00:31.334
Fishing? With dynamite?

00:31.335 --> 00:33.658
Yeah. You signed the damn permit.

00:33.659 --> 00:37.038
I need to start reading those things.

00:37.039 --> 00:41.016
Don't worry. I'm an explosives expert.

00:41.017 --> 00:42.053
Oops.

00:42.054 --> 00:43.974
Shit!

01:02.027 --> 01:05.627
Oh, my God! It's a miracle!

01:05.777 --> 01:10.817
You're damn right it
is. I can touch my Peter!

01:23.140 --> 01:24.712
We're all gonna miss Edith.

01:24.713 --> 01:28.197
I feel so lucky that I got to
know my great-great-grandmother.

01:28.198 --> 01:29.628
Thank you all for coming. I know...

01:29.629 --> 01:34.669
Wait, wait, wait. I'd
like to say a few words.

01:36.291 --> 01:38.877
Edith was very special to me.

01:38.878 --> 01:43.700
Every time we made sweet love was
like our first time, at least for her.

01:43.701 --> 01:46.621
- She had Alzheimer's.
- Who the [Bleep] is this guy?

01:46.622 --> 01:48.671
She used to love my poetry.

01:48.672 --> 01:50.948
Here's one more for you, Edith.

01:50.949 --> 01:53.276
Edith was a little racist.

01:53.277 --> 01:56.019
She said she did not like black faces.

01:56.020 --> 01:59.530
But I had a black part that
she loved with her heart,

01:59.531 --> 02:04.131
and that part broke
her hip in five places.

02:04.132 --> 02:07.432
Beautiful. Just beautiful.

02:10.425 --> 02:11.885
I'm sorry, Denzel.

02:11.886 --> 02:14.189
Looks like you're taking
Edith's death pretty hard, huh?

02:14.190 --> 02:16.270
What? No. She was 112 years old.

02:16.271 --> 02:19.861
That bitch should've
been dead 30 years ago.

02:19.862 --> 02:22.788
I'm sad because I made love
to the oldest woman on Earth.

02:22.789 --> 02:25.540
I've done it all now.
Where do I go from here?

02:25.541 --> 02:27.461
Hell?

02:28.791 --> 02:30.794
So, what's this big, important news?

02:30.795 --> 02:33.595
Yeah, Woody, what are we doing... uh!

02:33.596 --> 02:35.456
Yes!

02:39.278 --> 02:41.991
Oh, my God. She's completely healed.

02:41.992 --> 02:43.637
And my rash is gone.

02:43.638 --> 02:47.178
I wonder if it cures bitch.

02:47.810 --> 02:50.374
I think my hymen just grew back.

02:50.375 --> 02:52.613
Don't worry. It'll be
gone after happy hour.

02:52.614 --> 02:55.372
Rangers, old Woody has
discovered a miracle.

02:55.373 --> 02:59.053
As you can see, this lake cures any
ailment, from the common cold to cancer.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.487
You could have just told us.

03:00.488 --> 03:03.124
Yeah, sure, but this way was more fun.

03:03.125 --> 03:04.716
How were you sure it would work?

03:04.717 --> 03:07.238
Connie could have... uh!

03:07.239 --> 03:08.796
I could get used to this.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.864
There must be a scientific explanation.

03:10.865 --> 03:12.533
Yeah, asshole, there is.

03:12.534 --> 03:15.402
I was chosen by God to heal the sick.

03:15.403 --> 03:17.905
And another reason
not to believe in God.

03:17.906 --> 03:21.943
The Lord works in mysterious ways,
and right now, he wants me to be rich.

03:21.944 --> 03:24.611
Sick people, lost souls,
deep pockets, blah blah blah.

03:24.612 --> 03:27.283
Religion equals money! Now,
we've got a lot of work to do.

03:27.284 --> 03:29.650
Work? You were supposed to
take me snowboarding today.

03:29.651 --> 03:31.652
Sorry. No time, Cubbykins.

03:31.653 --> 03:36.657
Daddy is God's prophet now,
and I do plan to profit.

03:36.658 --> 03:39.014
Yeah. Another scam that'll
blow up in your face.

03:39.015 --> 03:41.459
I want to shred the
slopes like Shaun White.

03:41.460 --> 03:43.430
He gets lots of ass for an ugly woman.

03:43.431 --> 03:46.400
Shred the slope? You've
never even seen snow.

03:46.401 --> 03:48.069
Wait. You've never seen snow?

03:48.070 --> 03:50.938
Could somebody explain to the
diversity hire that bears hibernate?

03:50.939 --> 03:54.308
That means sleep for a long time, Denzel,
something you should be familiar with.

03:54.309 --> 03:55.777
Take it easy on Denzel.

03:55.778 --> 03:57.845
He's had a rough day... uh!

03:57.846 --> 03:59.777
What's wrong, Denzel?

03:59.778 --> 04:02.850
Ever since I was a
little boy, I had a dream.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.719
And then, I realized that dream.

04:05.720 --> 04:06.921
And now...

04:06.922 --> 04:08.842
Shit!

04:08.856 --> 04:10.892
Sorry, I couldn't listen
to any more of that.

04:10.893 --> 04:13.694
God, this would be so much more
satisfying if that lake wasn't there.

04:13.695 --> 04:16.714
Connie, Steve, go round
up every sick, gullible,

04:16.716 --> 04:19.964
emotionally needy, dumbass,
lonely loser with a bank account.

04:19.964 --> 04:22.715
Denzel, Ethel, take Malloy
up the mountain to snowboard.

04:22.716 --> 04:24.638
- Stat!
- So, that's it?

04:24.639 --> 04:26.230
You're gonna exploit this lake?

04:26.231 --> 04:29.482
Exploit the lake and help
the sick and disabled.

04:29.483 --> 04:34.148
Imagine what they'll do
with a new lease on life.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.545
Oh, my God!

04:36.546 --> 04:42.378
Honey, ever since I blew my arms and
legs off, I've been dying to do this.

04:42.379 --> 04:44.899
Oh! Oh, Lord!

04:45.627 --> 04:47.777
- Oh! Oh, God, yeah.
- Mmm! Mmm, oh!

04:47.778 --> 04:50.698
Oh! Oh, Jim! Oh, Lord!

04:50.699 --> 04:53.459
Oh! Oh, Jim! Oh!

04:58.004 --> 05:00.674
Damn. Malloy, are you really
gonna use all this junk?

05:00.675 --> 05:02.643
Are you really gonna bitch
the whole way up this mountain?

05:02.644 --> 05:04.478
All right, almost there...

05:04.479 --> 05:06.180
You spoiled little shit.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.816
- Little what'd you say?
- I said, "nice hat."

05:08.817 --> 05:11.397
Oh, thank you.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.770
Okay, we're here.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.111
Watch this.

05:16.959 --> 05:19.259
All right. I can't snowboard.

05:19.260 --> 05:21.162
And I can't stand
this white, cold stuff.

05:21.163 --> 05:22.804
Uh, that's snow.

05:22.805 --> 05:24.698
This is snow? You should've told me!

05:24.699 --> 05:26.298
It sucks! Let's get out of here.

05:26.299 --> 05:28.673
That's it? A five-hour hike for that?

05:28.674 --> 05:34.574
No, uh-uh. We ain't leaving this spot
till you build a snowman or some shit.

05:35.915 --> 05:38.316
Guys, I found some rope.

05:38.317 --> 05:44.217
You'll probably want to hang
yourself before you freeze to death.

05:45.324 --> 05:49.104
All right, this isn't so hard.

05:49.221 --> 05:52.881
Praise Jesus and good morning!

05:53.786 --> 05:57.421
We'd like to tell you
about Miracle Lake.

05:57.422 --> 05:58.890
Praise jes...

05:58.891 --> 06:00.591
Praise... prai...

06:00.592 --> 06:03.394
- Praise Jesus, and good mor...
- Let me stop you right there.

06:03.395 --> 06:04.896
We're Scientologists.

06:04.897 --> 06:06.564
Come on in. We'll tell you about it.

06:06.565 --> 06:09.333
Oh, no, scientology is
only for the weak-minded.

06:09.334 --> 06:10.981
We're not falling for that.

06:10.982 --> 06:13.304
I can't believe we're
Scientologists now.

06:13.305 --> 06:16.217
Don't worry, I'm sure we
can quit any time we want.

06:16.218 --> 06:17.828
What the hell are you doing here?

06:17.829 --> 06:20.511
We're here to spread our
message of peace and love.

06:20.512 --> 06:21.750
Oh, no, you don't!

06:21.751 --> 06:27.651
<i>We're spreading our message of
peace and love, you [Bleep]suckers!</i>

06:30.389 --> 06:33.911
"Abraham begat Isaac,
Isaac begat Jacob."

06:33.912 --> 06:35.877
Woody "be-gatting" a headache!

06:35.878 --> 06:40.247
God! Why the hell did
you write this gibberish?

06:40.248 --> 06:42.834
Oh, hey, Malloy.
Where's Ethel and Denzel?

06:42.835 --> 06:44.402
Freezing to death in an ice cave.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.602
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ice cave, that's nice.

06:46.603 --> 06:48.420
Good morning, brothers and sisters!

06:48.421 --> 06:51.124
- You suck!
- Okay.

06:51.125 --> 06:53.445
Welcome to the Miracle
Lake Church of God,

06:53.446 --> 06:56.698
his holy mistress Mary, and
their love child, the baby Jesus.

06:56.699 --> 06:59.643
Please put your praying hands together!

06:59.644 --> 07:03.322
And welcome to the stage God's BFF...

07:03.323 --> 07:05.377
Reverend Woody!

07:05.378 --> 07:08.078
Amen! Hallelujah!

07:10.895 --> 07:15.479
Miracles? Oh, brothers and
sisters, have I seen miracles!

07:15.480 --> 07:21.339
Like when, uh... shit, uh, like when
Moses turned, uh, fish into wine.

07:21.340 --> 07:25.109
Or like when the Holy Ghost
gave birth to Adam and Eve.

07:25.110 --> 07:27.750
Who's with me?

07:28.413 --> 07:30.561
Hey, I didn't write this crap, okay?

07:30.562 --> 07:34.996
The point is, this lake before
you is the greatest miracle of all.

07:34.997 --> 07:36.848
Well, what do we have here?

07:36.849 --> 07:38.789
- I'm blind.
- I can see that.

07:38.790 --> 07:40.629
I'm not blind.

07:40.630 --> 07:45.296
Now, what can I do you for?
Fix your bum knee or something?

07:45.297 --> 07:48.125
Okay, okay. You don't
have to get an attitude.

07:48.126 --> 07:52.686
By the power of
Grayskull, alakazam! Poom!

07:56.175 --> 08:00.555
It's a miracle! I can see! I can see!

08:01.272 --> 08:04.152
But I can't swim.

08:04.867 --> 08:10.255
Oh, my God, I've got to start
getting the money up front.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.790
All right, I'm in.

08:12.791 --> 08:15.360
Jesus saves, but he doesn't trust banks.

08:15.361 --> 08:18.181
Cash only, people.

08:20.234 --> 08:22.441
This is by far the
best idea I've ever had.

08:22.442 --> 08:23.949
<i>What? Your idea?</i>

08:23.950 --> 08:27.013
But this is small potatoes.
Real evangelists make big money.

08:27.014 --> 08:29.572
I'll whip you into shape.

08:29.573 --> 08:32.336
In the beginning, God
created heaven and heaven.

08:32.337 --> 08:33.278
Ow!

08:33.279 --> 08:34.821
Earth! You hesitated.

08:34.822 --> 08:36.462
Real evangelists know the Bible front...

08:36.464 --> 08:37.640
To back.

08:37.642 --> 08:40.102
Jesus Christ!

08:42.222 --> 08:44.683
Good. Crying on command.
That's lesson two.

08:44.684 --> 08:46.217
Now let's cover showmanship.

08:46.218 --> 08:48.198
Dance!

08:49.347 --> 08:51.387
Faster!

08:52.849 --> 08:55.945
Enough! Even God rested
on the fourth day!

08:55.946 --> 08:58.346
Ow! Seventh!

09:01.190 --> 09:02.191
Where are we?

09:02.192 --> 09:05.601
We fell into some kind of ice cavern.

09:05.602 --> 09:09.469
This must have been a
glacier, frozen over years ago.

09:09.470 --> 09:11.870
Oh, my God.

09:12.687 --> 09:15.772
That looks like a Neanderthal
woman frozen in ice.

09:15.773 --> 09:19.144
She must be at least 400,000 years old.

09:19.145 --> 09:20.844
Uh, that's more than 112, right?

09:20.845 --> 09:23.129
Yeah. First off, we've got to... hey!

feeling a little jetlagged

the future, so let me catch you up.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.339
<i>Dinosaurs are dead,
we landed on the moon,</i>

11:33.340 --> 11:36.778
<i>and they made a sequel to Dirty
Dancing called Havana Nights.</i>

11:36.779 --> 11:38.580
Now let's get down to business.

11:38.581 --> 11:41.283
I'm gonna make you feel
right at home, girl.

11:41.284 --> 11:44.464
Oh, yabba dabba do me!

11:45.721 --> 11:49.441
<i>Got it! Not a Flintstones fan.</i>

11:50.859 --> 11:52.561
Hey, where are the key lights?

11:52.562 --> 11:53.961
Careful with the stained glass.

11:53.962 --> 11:56.565
Come on, people, TV crews
are covering this live.

11:56.566 --> 11:58.785
Just think of how much
more money we'll make

11:58.786 --> 12:04.105
when millions of people see firsthand
what a gentle, godly man I really am.

12:04.106 --> 12:06.074
Who's that Dick on a stick?

12:06.075 --> 12:10.111
I wanted a blue-eyed
Jesus, not a Jew-guy Jesus!

12:10.112 --> 12:12.194
I feel like I'm praying
to my goddamn accountant!

12:12.195 --> 12:14.616
- How much did all this cost?
- I don't know!

12:14.617 --> 12:16.351
A shitload. Ask my accountant.

12:16.352 --> 12:20.612
The man is right. It cost a shitload.

12:21.890 --> 12:24.426
I have to apologize for my
behavior a little earlier.

12:24.427 --> 12:26.127
Let's get to know each other.

12:26.128 --> 12:28.029
Denzel.

12:28.030 --> 12:31.333
- Krog.
- Krog? That's a beautiful name.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.754
Aah! No! Stop! Let me go!

12:35.211 --> 12:37.217
Man, what the hell?

12:37.218 --> 12:38.473
Oh, I see.

12:38.474 --> 12:41.480
Y'all liked it rough
back in the ice age. Okay.

12:41.481 --> 12:43.599
Krog like talking shadow.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.180
That's racist as hell, but I like it.

12:46.181 --> 12:48.806
Krog give happy cave to you.

12:48.807 --> 12:53.307
Damn! That's some B.C. bush right there.

12:54.133 --> 12:55.333
Okay, how do you like it?

12:55.334 --> 12:57.836
Maybe we start out
Missionary, and then...

12:57.837 --> 12:59.170
Oh!

12:59.171 --> 13:00.772
Whoa! Take it easy! Take it easy!

13:00.773 --> 13:02.507
Aah! Aah! Oh, no!

13:02.508 --> 13:05.351
Slow up! It don't bend that way!

13:05.352 --> 13:09.554
Ah! That was wonderful, baby. I
wish I could stay here forever.

13:09.555 --> 13:11.697
Denzel, I made it to the top!

13:11.698 --> 13:13.918
Gotta go!

13:15.987 --> 13:18.422
Yep, that's right, Guinness
Book of World Records!

13:18.423 --> 13:20.391
400,000 years old.

13:20.392 --> 13:23.282
Herman, Paddy, Liam! A new world record!

13:23.283 --> 13:25.620
Oldest white woman
[Bleep] by a black man!

13:25.621 --> 13:27.661
Hooray!

13:28.848 --> 13:31.728
Whew! That's done.

13:32.470 --> 13:34.000
What? What are you doing here?

13:34.001 --> 13:37.009
Krog love. We mate for life.

13:37.010 --> 13:40.544
What you talking about, Krog?

13:40.545 --> 13:44.935
My chillins, if you want
to heal, you've got to give.

13:44.936 --> 13:46.858
You gotta give till it hurts!

13:46.859 --> 13:49.559
You gotta give until you say, "ow!"

13:49.560 --> 13:51.227
Your kids don't need Christmas.

13:51.228 --> 13:54.284
The Devil made up Christmas!

13:54.285 --> 13:59.066
What's a college education
got on spiritual rejuvenation?

13:59.067 --> 14:02.773
Ooh, all material things are evil!

14:02.774 --> 14:06.936
Except for the Jesus
jet, which is awesome!

14:06.937 --> 14:11.677
Oh, brothers and sisters,
it's healing time!

14:12.162 --> 14:14.520
Who's first?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.277
Me, me! Pick me!

14:16.278 --> 14:17.445
We've got a harelip here.

14:17.446 --> 14:19.760
I repeat, a harelip.
This guy is a gold mine.

14:19.761 --> 14:21.328
A hilarious gold mine.

14:21.329 --> 14:23.730
And what is your name, my son?

14:23.731 --> 14:25.132
Menjamin Mippman.

14:25.133 --> 14:27.301
His name is Cinnamon Biscuit.

14:27.302 --> 14:30.398
By the power vested in me by God!

14:30.399 --> 14:33.006
And Mel Gibson's movies!

14:33.007 --> 14:36.487
I now pronounce you healed!

14:38.329 --> 14:43.753
- Oh, did it nerk?
- What the...? You're healed again!

14:43.754 --> 14:45.424
Did it nerk nat nime?

14:45.425 --> 14:48.861
Heal, heal, you
harelipped son of a bitch!

14:48.862 --> 14:50.782
Heal!

14:53.229 --> 14:56.113
Uh, Cinnamon, you okay?

14:56.114 --> 14:59.534
Mr. Biscuits? Mr. Biscuits!

15:01.336 --> 15:04.571
Oh, great, it worked that
time. My harelip is gone.

15:04.572 --> 15:06.620
See? I can speak normal now.

15:06.621 --> 15:09.311
I don't sound ridiculous no more.

15:09.312 --> 15:12.539
Praise Jesus! Another miracle!

15:12.540 --> 15:14.849
He stole our money! Get him!

15:14.850 --> 15:15.883
Crucify him!

15:15.884 --> 15:18.018
- He's a fraud!
- He's evil!

15:18.019 --> 15:19.553
- String him up!
- What are you doing?

15:19.554 --> 15:21.021
Hey! No!

15:21.022 --> 15:22.223
- Crucify him!
- Come on, man!

15:22.224 --> 15:24.558
- Kill him!
- People, please.

15:24.559 --> 15:26.397
Is this any way to treat a man of God?

15:26.398 --> 15:29.354
Yeah, what if they
had done this to Jesus?

15:29.355 --> 15:30.630
Shut the [Bleep] up, Steve.

15:30.631 --> 15:32.880
Reverend Woody just needs
to have a conversation

15:32.881 --> 15:34.835
with his friend and
business partner, God.

15:34.836 --> 15:37.071
I promise the lake will be
up and running in no time.

15:37.072 --> 15:42.142
The most important thing to
remember is, no one needs a refund.

15:42.143 --> 15:44.111
Can we at least stone his ass?

15:44.112 --> 15:46.747
I don't see why not. Ten
bucks a rock sound fair?

15:46.748 --> 15:49.984
You know, this is not... ow! Ow! Hey!

15:49.985 --> 15:53.465
Whoa! Whoa! Gaah! Hey! Ooh!

15:57.574 --> 16:03.474
Now, Krog, I like you, but, uh, I'm not
really ready for a serious relationship.

16:05.338 --> 16:07.401
What are these rocks and bones for?

16:07.402 --> 16:10.310
Wait, are you moving your stuff in?

16:10.311 --> 16:13.240
- What are you doing to my walls?
- Krog redecorate.

16:13.241 --> 16:16.026
What the hell is this shit? A
stick man fighting a buffalo?

16:16.027 --> 16:19.056
- I gotta get some air.
- You not go.

16:19.057 --> 16:21.440
You never leave Krog.

16:21.441 --> 16:24.741
Are you happy now, Dick?

16:30.425 --> 16:32.764
I don't want to do this anymore, Malloy.

16:32.765 --> 16:35.270
Those people are monsters.

16:35.271 --> 16:39.142
Hey, this money train ain't
stopping. Now, try again.

16:39.143 --> 16:42.900
Oh, God, please return
the power to this lake...

16:42.901 --> 16:44.800
For the sick people.

16:44.801 --> 16:47.354
- And for the money.
- He knows about the money, Malloy!

16:47.355 --> 16:49.486
God! Can you hear me, God?

16:49.487 --> 16:51.376
Yes, Woody, I can.

16:51.377 --> 16:54.511
- You're not God.
- No, but I do play him for a living.

16:54.512 --> 16:58.215
Anyway, where's this Miracle Lake
I've heard about? I could use a dip.

16:58.216 --> 17:00.427
I've got the most
bothersome case of penis pox.

17:00.428 --> 17:03.987
Well, this used to be Miracle
Lake, but she don't work no more.

17:03.988 --> 17:06.281
Oh, you don't want to go in that lake.

17:06.281 --> 17:08.630
Why, that's where I dump
all my medical waste.

17:08.631 --> 17:09.863
Medical waste?

17:09.864 --> 17:12.446
So that's the reason
this lake had powers?

17:12.448 --> 17:15.616
Why the hell did you dump
medical waste in there anyway?

17:15.617 --> 17:17.684
Well, you did sign this permit.

17:17.685 --> 17:22.296
Whew! I gotta stop getting
drunk and signing permits.

17:22.297 --> 17:24.827
How's it going, Captain Caveman?

17:24.828 --> 17:26.675
Not good. Krog's crazy.

17:26.675 --> 17:28.462
She had me locked in my cabin for days.

17:28.463 --> 17:31.418
I had to distract her with a crudely
carved wheel and jump out the window.

17:31.419 --> 17:34.217
Wow, I can't believe
thawing out and making love

17:34.218 --> 17:37.324
to a 400,000-year-old
Neanderthal didn't work out.

17:37.325 --> 17:39.226
It looked so good on paper.

17:39.227 --> 17:40.497
Ethel, you've got to help me!

17:40.498 --> 17:43.421
Well, I do have three ex-boyfriends
who work at the Natural History Museum.

17:43.422 --> 17:46.432
Well, four if you count the janitor.
I'm sure they'd take her off your hands.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.428
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

17:47.429 --> 17:49.936
Are they gonna do a bunch of
crazy-ass E.T. experiments on her?

17:49.937 --> 17:54.437
- Probably.
- Good, [Bleep] that bitch up.

18:05.236 --> 18:08.862
There she is! A living,
breathing Neanderthal.

18:08.863 --> 18:12.597
We can't be too careful.
She looks strong.

18:12.598 --> 18:14.398
Uh!

18:16.197 --> 18:17.520
Wait, wait, back up.

18:17.521 --> 18:21.755
So you're telling me that it was medical
waste that gave this lake its power?

18:21.756 --> 18:24.925
- So it would appear.
- Well, there's only one thing to do.

18:24.926 --> 18:27.127
- Tell people the truth.
- Dump in more medical waste.

18:27.128 --> 18:29.996
Yeah. What the hell was
I thinking? The truth.

18:29.997 --> 18:32.545
Don't look at me,
fellows. I'm fresh out.

18:32.546 --> 18:36.570
But I do keep a meticulous inventory
of my illegal dumping for tax purposes.

18:36.571 --> 18:37.375
Good thinking.

18:37.376 --> 18:43.136
If you recreate the batch, it
should have the same effect.

19:04.808 --> 19:05.532
Aah!

19:05.533 --> 19:08.502
Where you been? Krog worried sick.

19:08.503 --> 19:10.058
Oh, what are you doing here?

19:10.059 --> 19:12.439
You're supposed to be stuffed
in a museum or some shit.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.496
- What happened?
- Amazing news today.

19:14.497 --> 19:17.195
A prehistoric ice woman was
found in a National Park.

19:17.196 --> 19:18.561
Oh, eeh!

19:18.562 --> 19:22.745
Scientists plan to do a bunch of
crazy-ass E.T., experiments on her.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.551
Uh, I'm sorry, baby.

19:24.552 --> 19:26.791
Oh, how about I make you a fancy dinner?

19:26.792 --> 19:29.623
I'll grab the Kool-Aid.
You grab the fish sticks.

19:29.624 --> 19:31.964
Okay, baby.

19:34.963 --> 19:36.581
- Let me out! Let me out!
- Don't worry.

19:36.582 --> 19:38.707
I'll thaw you out when I'm
ready for a serious relationship

19:38.708 --> 19:44.288
in about 400,000 years, you
crazy-ass cro-magnon bitch.

19:44.896 --> 19:47.116
Kill him!

19:48.526 --> 19:53.206
Dump it! Hurry, dump
it! Dump it! Dump it!

19:58.702 --> 20:00.175
It's working.

20:00.176 --> 20:03.596
It's working! We're back!

20:04.849 --> 20:08.339
Hear me ye sick and dying losers!

20:08.340 --> 20:11.465
Miracle Lake is back in business!

20:11.466 --> 20:13.611
Let's do a mass healing!

20:13.612 --> 20:17.272
Everybody in! The waters fine!

20:19.414 --> 20:20.597
Well we did it Doc.

20:20.598 --> 20:24.839
I can't believe we were able to
recreate your medical waste exactly.

20:24.840 --> 20:27.680
What are the odds we'd find a three
pound two ounce Armenian fetus?

20:27.681 --> 20:30.999
Armenian fetus? Oh drat
my sloppy handwriting.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.867
That says two pound
three ounce Iranian fetus.

20:33.868 --> 20:38.848
Iranian, Armenian, what
difference could it make?

20:39.150 --> 20:41.471
- Oh.
- It's a miracle!

20:41.472 --> 20:44.567
What did you do? All these people are...

20:44.568 --> 20:48.160
- Malloy, it doesn't heal people anymore.
- Yeah, I know.
