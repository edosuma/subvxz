WEBVTT

00:00.449 --> 00:01.919
Previously on Gotham...

00:02.646 --> 00:05.539
Where is Xander Wilde?

00:07.143 --> 00:08.776
My God,

00:08.778 --> 00:10.077
there's two of 'em.

00:10.079 --> 00:12.113
I'm gonna drive you mad...

00:12.116 --> 00:12.971
brother.

00:12.974 --> 00:15.315
All of Gotham will be joining you, too.

00:15.318 --> 00:18.179
You shall become the Demon's Head.

00:19.549 --> 00:22.256
She's got the mark of the Demon's Head.

00:22.258 --> 00:23.591
No woman has ever been allowed

00:23.593 --> 00:25.804
to lead the League of Shadows.

00:27.263 --> 00:30.223
But the sisters of the
League are yours to command.

00:30.226 --> 00:33.000
Tell me what I need to know.

00:34.604 --> 00:37.567
I could have killed
Jerome, but I didn't.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.872
Don't take so much responsibility that

00:39.875 --> 00:42.176
you get yourself killed.

00:42.178 --> 00:44.122
I came up with a plan

00:44.125 --> 00:47.411
to turn this city into a madhouse.

00:49.952 --> 00:52.895
Oh, we're gonna need a lot more of this.

00:56.592 --> 00:58.515
Thank you all for coming this evening.

00:58.518 --> 01:02.163
As your interim mayor, I
know my recent appointment

01:02.165 --> 01:03.597
was sudden.

01:03.599 --> 01:06.834
And, perhaps, a bit of a shock to some.

01:06.836 --> 01:08.664
Quite frankly, I was shocked.

01:08.667 --> 01:11.839
What is important now is the
future of this great city.

01:11.841 --> 01:13.989
And that is why I am
meeting with all of you.

01:13.992 --> 01:15.176
Well, Mayor,

01:15.178 --> 01:19.480
as chairperson of
Gotham's Moral Authority

01:19.482 --> 01:21.426
Society, our members

01:21.429 --> 01:23.651
have been, quite frankly,

01:23.653 --> 01:27.188
unnerved by the recent going-ons

01:27.190 --> 01:28.692
in our great city.

01:28.695 --> 01:29.913
We have seen

01:29.916 --> 01:32.616
criminals take office, gun fights

01:32.619 --> 01:34.309
in our streets, corruption...

01:34.312 --> 01:37.832
Mrs. Haverstock, the
commissioner and I have worked

01:37.835 --> 01:40.067
tirelessly these past few weeks

01:40.069 --> 01:41.320
to improve the way

01:41.323 --> 01:43.169
this city conducts itself.

01:46.075 --> 01:47.843
Wyatt? Everything all right?

01:47.846 --> 01:49.145
We're looking into it now, sir.

01:49.148 --> 01:51.879
Did a window blow open?

01:51.881 --> 01:54.514
It's gotten so cold.

01:58.776 --> 02:01.036
- What's happened?
- Don't come any closer!

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.541 --> 02:20.040
Good evening, everyone.

02:23.695 --> 02:25.820
- What do you want with us?
- Sorry,

02:25.823 --> 02:27.781
no time for questions, Mr. Mayor.

02:27.783 --> 02:31.886
You see, your presence is
urgently needed elsewhere.

02:31.888 --> 02:34.355
Whatever you expect as ransom,

02:34.357 --> 02:36.524
I-I will double it.

02:39.862 --> 02:43.364
I have access to the
police pension fund.

02:43.366 --> 02:46.051
Wow, that could be a lot of money.

02:46.054 --> 02:49.470
Tempting, but, uh...

02:49.472 --> 02:51.138
no, thanks.

02:51.140 --> 02:52.320
Bridgit, isn't it?

02:52.323 --> 02:54.168
I can get you safe passage

02:54.171 --> 02:56.911
from the city, money, a new home...

02:56.913 --> 02:59.313
It was people like you that locked me up

02:59.315 --> 03:01.549
in Strange's lab, and thanks to that,

03:01.551 --> 03:03.751
there is no Bridgit anymore.

03:03.753 --> 03:05.753
I can get you a pardon, son.

03:05.755 --> 03:08.598
All will be forgiven,
just stop this lunatic.

03:08.601 --> 03:11.125
"Lunatic" is a little harsh.

03:11.127 --> 03:13.594
I prefer "visionary."

03:13.596 --> 03:16.430
Oswald, can't you do something?

03:19.067 --> 03:20.700
Afraid not.

03:20.703 --> 03:24.438
I am with Mr. Valeska 100%.

03:24.440 --> 03:27.395
Every cop in this city
will be looking for us,

03:27.398 --> 03:30.338
and when they find you, expect no mercy,

03:30.341 --> 03:31.840
just a hail of bullets.

03:31.843 --> 03:33.413
So serious.

03:33.416 --> 03:36.717
That's why your approval
ratings are so low.

03:36.719 --> 03:38.352
Hey, tell you what.

03:38.354 --> 03:40.671
Try threatening me again, but this time,

03:40.674 --> 03:42.241
try it with a smile.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.524
Aw, see, this is what's wrong.

03:45.527 --> 03:48.695
Nobody knows how to
have fun anymore, right?

03:48.698 --> 03:50.864
But see our friend down there?

03:50.866 --> 03:52.533
Bag head?

03:52.535 --> 03:54.335
He's figured out a way to solve that.

04:08.784 --> 04:10.367
It's time to give this city

04:10.370 --> 04:11.784
the boost it needs.

04:11.787 --> 04:13.287
Time to stop taking ourselves

04:13.289 --> 04:14.848
so seriously

04:14.851 --> 04:17.250
I mean, come on, Gotham.

04:17.253 --> 04:19.713
What do you have to lose?

04:22.164 --> 04:24.465
Except your sanity.

04:28.174 --> 04:33.406

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

04:34.410 --> 04:35.909
You gonna tell me why we needed

04:35.911 --> 04:37.311
to come to the garage, Alfred?

04:37.313 --> 04:40.414
Happy birthday, Master Wayne.

04:40.416 --> 04:43.117
You remembered.

04:43.119 --> 04:45.152
Of course I remembered.

04:45.154 --> 04:47.321
I bloody love your birthdays.

04:47.323 --> 04:49.406
Your seventh was an absolute blinder.

04:49.409 --> 04:51.625
Yeah, I remember you had
about 50 kids come up here,

04:51.627 --> 04:54.294
but you were off outside, on your own.

04:54.296 --> 04:57.364
You were obsessed by this one
gift that your dad gave you...

04:57.366 --> 04:58.867
This bright red wagon.

04:58.870 --> 05:01.301
You were in the garden all
day, collecting all these rocks.

05:01.303 --> 05:03.188
When I asked you what you
were gonna do with these rocks,

05:03.190 --> 05:07.040
you said, "I'm gonna build a home

05:07.042 --> 05:08.976
for my wagon.

05:08.985 --> 05:12.520
A secret place that only I know about."

05:26.156 --> 05:27.895
- What's this?
- Well, it's the reason why

05:27.897 --> 05:29.997
I brought you out to
the garage, Master Bruce.

05:38.541 --> 05:40.674
Alfred, I don't know what to say.

05:42.645 --> 05:46.413
V-8, five liter, 460 horsepower engine.

05:46.415 --> 05:48.982
Painted matte black, anti-reflective.

05:48.984 --> 05:50.484
Very difficult to see at night.

05:50.487 --> 05:52.087
Oh, and, of course, this.

05:53.759 --> 05:55.664
100% bulletproof.

05:58.027 --> 06:00.476
Best be prepared, eh?

06:08.037 --> 06:10.554
Oh... Oh, mate.

06:16.991 --> 06:18.190
Jim, hey.

06:18.193 --> 06:19.156
What gives?

06:19.159 --> 06:20.359
The mayor and the police commissioner

06:20.361 --> 06:21.794
have been kidnapped by Jerome.

06:21.797 --> 06:23.916
Got every cop in the city out there

06:23.919 --> 06:26.720
searching all the spots
Jerome's been seen the last week.

06:26.722 --> 06:28.222
You got something for me?

06:28.224 --> 06:29.890
I was gonna say I just
won a hundred bucks

06:29.892 --> 06:30.984
in the scratch-off lotto

06:30.987 --> 06:32.259
at the liquor store, and we could go

06:32.261 --> 06:33.961
to the track with it, but, uh,

06:33.963 --> 06:35.863
we can do your thing first.

06:35.865 --> 06:37.931
- Gordon.
- We need to talk.

06:37.933 --> 06:39.766
Oswald?

06:39.768 --> 06:42.236
I'm out back. Come alone.

06:45.671 --> 06:48.093
Yeah. All right.

06:52.715 --> 06:53.947
Well, this is a first.

06:53.949 --> 06:55.872
Are you doing anything about Jerome?

06:55.875 --> 06:57.284
We're looking for him.

06:57.286 --> 06:58.952
Do you know where he is?

06:58.954 --> 07:01.168
And if I did, do you really
think I would just tell you?

07:01.171 --> 07:03.490
Have you march in there, guns blazing?

07:03.492 --> 07:05.259
He needs to be stopped.

07:05.261 --> 07:07.250
He has everyone under his thumb...

07:07.253 --> 07:09.396
Freeze, Firefly, Hatter.

07:09.398 --> 07:11.257
They are all part of his plan.

07:11.260 --> 07:12.966
A dark, terrible plan.

07:12.968 --> 07:14.234
Which is?

07:14.236 --> 07:17.337
Scarecrow has made a gas for him.

07:17.339 --> 07:19.339
- Like a fear toxin?
- Worse.

07:19.341 --> 07:20.561
Much worse.

07:20.564 --> 07:21.997
I saw it turn someone into

07:22.000 --> 07:24.811
a maniacal, cackling, violent animal.

07:24.813 --> 07:27.014
And what does he plan to do with it?

07:27.016 --> 07:28.482
He's smart. He hasn't shared

07:28.484 --> 07:30.083
the details of his plans with anyone.

07:30.085 --> 07:32.543
Instead, we all have a
separate task to perform.

07:32.546 --> 07:34.021
Such as?

07:34.023 --> 07:35.856
He has yet to give me my role.

07:35.858 --> 07:38.358
Why did you come here if
you're not gonna help me?

07:38.360 --> 07:40.507
He scares the living
hell out of me, okay?

07:41.931 --> 07:44.665
I mean, I was willing
to play along with him

07:44.667 --> 07:45.742
for a while.

07:45.745 --> 07:47.633
Perhaps he had a way
to make us all rich?

07:47.636 --> 07:50.203
A return to the good old days, you know?

07:50.205 --> 07:52.139
But nothing good will come of this.

07:52.141 --> 07:55.208
Or maybe you just don't
like the competition.

07:55.210 --> 07:56.810
Jerome casts quite the shadow.

07:56.812 --> 07:59.109
Oh, please!

07:59.112 --> 08:01.562
He's a maniac, an anarchist.

08:01.565 --> 08:05.184
He is not interested in money or power.

08:05.187 --> 08:08.090
And I am an honest criminal, Jim.

08:08.093 --> 08:10.507
Where is he? Where is the gas?

08:10.510 --> 08:12.610
He only tells you what he needs to,

08:12.613 --> 08:14.079
when he needs to.

08:14.082 --> 08:16.106
I just know he has to be stopped.

08:16.109 --> 08:17.497
Jim! Hey!

08:17.499 --> 08:20.300
You down here?! Jim?!

08:20.302 --> 08:22.914
- Yeah.
- Hey.

08:22.917 --> 08:25.204
A uni just spotted Jerome
near Paisley Square.

08:25.207 --> 08:27.007
All right, let's go.

♪ Time has come today ♪

08:34.480 --> 08:37.347

Hey, what happened to my mic?

08:47.197 --> 08:48.854
Hey, buddy, beat it, will ya?

08:48.857 --> 08:50.054
I'm trying to work here.

08:50.766 --> 08:51.999
Whoo!

08:58.374 --> 09:01.008
Where's everyone going?

09:03.432 --> 09:06.562
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
the Arkham Asylum Lunatics.

09:06.565 --> 09:10.583
We came here to blow some minds! Whoo!

09:10.586 --> 09:14.187
Sorry to interrupt your little show,

09:14.189 --> 09:16.957
but you are gonna love this next one.

09:16.959 --> 09:20.460
Introducing Mayor Pritchard,

09:20.462 --> 09:22.396
Commissioner Reynolds,

09:22.398 --> 09:24.129
Archbishop McGregor,

09:24.132 --> 09:26.366
and this lady...

09:26.368 --> 09:27.901
whoever she is.

09:27.903 --> 09:29.539
This is everybody.

09:29.542 --> 09:31.757
Everybody, say hi.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.640
Now, as you can see,

09:34.643 --> 09:36.953
we're still waiting
for two guests of honor.

09:36.956 --> 09:39.912
But in the meantime,
let's go over the rules

09:39.915 --> 09:41.214
of tonight's entertainment,

09:41.216 --> 09:42.816
shall we?

09:42.818 --> 09:44.051
Dynamite.

09:45.387 --> 09:46.987
Trigger.

09:46.989 --> 09:49.089
I don't get what I want?

09:49.091 --> 09:51.851
Boom. Headless people.

09:51.854 --> 09:53.476
And if any of you are thinking

09:53.479 --> 09:55.921
of going anywhere, you'll die, too.

09:57.131 --> 10:00.156
Now, the one man who can
give me what I want...

10:00.159 --> 10:01.601
Come over here.

10:01.603 --> 10:04.237
Calling Gordon.

10:04.239 --> 10:07.593
Calling Captain James Gordon.

10:12.618 --> 10:15.419
I speak on behalf of myself

10:15.421 --> 10:18.121
and all other gang leaders in this city

10:18.123 --> 10:22.025
when I say your arrogance and disrespect

10:22.027 --> 10:25.429
will no longer be tolerated.

10:25.431 --> 10:29.733
You beat and then dragged
my brother from here

10:29.735 --> 10:31.578
like a dog.

10:31.581 --> 10:34.104
Your brother's an ass.

10:34.106 --> 10:37.207
He abuses our staff and refuses
to pay his exorbitant tab.

10:37.209 --> 10:39.315
He is my brother,

10:39.318 --> 10:41.781
and he demands your respect.

10:41.784 --> 10:43.487
And I suppose an apology

10:43.490 --> 10:45.023
would be out of the question?

10:46.618 --> 10:49.253
Your blood will be

10:49.256 --> 10:51.450
his apology.

10:51.453 --> 10:53.222
Thought so.

11:09.542 --> 11:11.315
Could've handled them.

11:11.318 --> 11:14.516
That's the advantage of having
your own personal army, Tabs...

11:14.519 --> 11:16.195
You don't have to.

11:16.198 --> 11:18.415
Isn't that right?

11:22.688 --> 11:24.955
What's wrong?

11:24.957 --> 11:27.750
Ra's al Ghul chose you, no one else,

11:27.753 --> 11:29.289
to pass on his spirit.

11:29.292 --> 11:31.962
We will serve you,
protect you, of course,

11:31.964 --> 11:34.030
but surely, you intend
to continue his legacy

11:34.032 --> 11:36.533
and not just remain here in this place?

11:36.535 --> 11:38.335
What does that mean?

11:40.237 --> 11:42.139
"Continue his legacy."

11:42.141 --> 11:44.508
I like the sound of that.

11:44.510 --> 11:46.777
As I told you...

11:46.779 --> 11:50.113
we have much more to show you.

11:50.115 --> 11:51.982
Are you ready?

11:51.984 --> 11:54.217
Yes.

12:04.329 --> 12:06.096
What the hell is that?

12:22.113 --> 12:26.203
Gentlemen, ladies, your assistance

12:26.206 --> 12:28.852
is urgently required.

12:28.854 --> 12:31.292
Be careful... these are
very dangerous materials.

12:31.295 --> 12:33.295
Oh, we're counting on it.

12:34.376 --> 12:36.610
More laughing gas

12:36.613 --> 12:38.269
we need to make.

12:39.865 --> 12:40.964
What?

12:40.966 --> 12:43.099
There's no time to waste!

12:43.101 --> 12:46.269
We need it in bulk, you see.

12:46.271 --> 12:48.683
W-Well, how much of it do you need?

12:50.642 --> 12:52.542
Oh.

12:52.544 --> 12:54.110
This much.

13:09.327 --> 13:12.295
Ladies and gentlemen,
as I live and breathe,

13:12.297 --> 13:14.864
James Gordon is in the house.

13:17.269 --> 13:19.894
I'm not talking to you
until I can get up there

13:19.897 --> 13:22.305
and check on the
well-being of your hostages.

13:22.307 --> 13:25.141
First of all, Jim, you're late.

13:25.144 --> 13:29.336
Secondly, I think I'm the one
who should be making demands.

13:29.339 --> 13:30.648
Don't you?

13:30.651 --> 13:33.440
What you're doing is an
act of terror, Valeska.

13:33.443 --> 13:35.523
- Yeah, you scumbag!
- Ask our mayor

13:35.526 --> 13:39.188
what this city's policy is on
negotiating with terrorists.

13:39.191 --> 13:40.356
Terrorist?

13:40.358 --> 13:42.192
Frankly, I'm offended.

13:42.194 --> 13:43.753
No, no, no!

13:43.756 --> 13:45.115
That's close enough, Gordon.

13:49.334 --> 13:53.002
And none of you go anywhere, either.

13:57.876 --> 13:59.576
Dead man's trigger.

14:00.737 --> 14:02.312
This falls out of my hand

14:02.314 --> 14:04.481
for any reason and...

14:04.483 --> 14:06.182
bang!

14:07.686 --> 14:10.820
I got two empty chairs here.

14:10.822 --> 14:12.989
You haven't even asked
me who they're for yet.

14:12.991 --> 14:15.086
All right, I'll bite. Who are they for?

14:15.089 --> 14:16.753
Come on, James.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.328
You're a detective.

14:18.330 --> 14:19.862
Do some detecting.

14:21.533 --> 14:24.134
Jeremiah, your brother.

14:24.136 --> 14:26.903
Bingo. That's one.

14:26.905 --> 14:29.234
- And the other?
- Well, the only other

14:29.237 --> 14:32.809
irksome do-gooder who's ever
spoiled my fun in this town.

14:34.586 --> 14:37.079
Bruce Wayne!

14:37.082 --> 14:39.482
No.

14:39.484 --> 14:41.151
No?

14:41.153 --> 14:42.628
You can take me.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.832
I'll sit up there with
one of those things

14:44.835 --> 14:47.284
around my neck, but I
won't let you have him.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.464
Well, I don't want you,

14:49.467 --> 14:51.300
Jim.

14:51.303 --> 14:53.062
I want my brother

14:53.064 --> 14:54.609
and I want Bruce.

14:54.612 --> 14:56.065
I want them now.

14:56.067 --> 14:58.273
All right. Let me get
these people out of here,

14:58.276 --> 14:59.369
I'll come up there...

14:59.371 --> 15:00.726
You are not listening to me!

15:02.040 --> 15:04.040
And that is forcing my hand.

15:08.213 --> 15:09.345
Jerome...

15:12.224 --> 15:13.282
No...

15:21.229 --> 15:23.426
Bring me my brother.

15:23.428 --> 15:26.930
Bring me Wayne.

15:26.932 --> 15:29.199
Bring 'em now.

15:33.958 --> 15:35.936
♪ Happy birthday ♪

15:35.939 --> 15:38.282
♪ A dear, Master B. ♪

15:38.284 --> 15:40.385
♪ Happy birthday ♪

15:40.387 --> 15:42.053
♪ To you. ♪

15:42.055 --> 15:43.749
I'll get some plates.

15:50.124 --> 15:53.527
You know, for a billionaire,
your security system is...

15:53.530 --> 15:54.730
lame.

15:54.733 --> 15:56.267
Miss Kyle.

15:56.269 --> 15:58.002
Thank you, Alfred.

15:58.004 --> 15:59.237
Enjoy.

16:04.116 --> 16:05.777
Thank you.

16:05.779 --> 16:07.545
For what?

16:07.547 --> 16:09.881
Visiting me on my birthday.

16:09.883 --> 16:11.282
Oh.

16:11.284 --> 16:13.397
I actually didn't know
it was your birthday.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.850
I just happened to be
strolling in the neighborhood.

16:16.851 --> 16:19.108
- Mm-hmm.
- Either way...

16:19.111 --> 16:21.145
it's good to see you.

16:29.733 --> 16:31.543
I knew it was an act.

16:32.906 --> 16:34.639
What?

16:34.641 --> 16:36.441
The brat...

16:36.443 --> 16:39.608
and the drinking, the-the friends.

16:39.611 --> 16:42.372
It was an act.

16:42.375 --> 16:44.909
I think you're more
sure about that than me.

16:46.419 --> 16:48.444
Master Bruce,

16:48.447 --> 16:49.753
we have visitors.

16:49.756 --> 16:51.422
Bruce, we need your help.

16:51.424 --> 16:53.591
What happened?

16:55.202 --> 16:58.329
Don't you know it's rude
to keep a guy waiting?

16:58.331 --> 17:00.983
Bring me my hostages, James.

17:00.986 --> 17:04.601
My trigger finger is getting itchy.

17:04.604 --> 17:08.176
The hostages he wants are his brother...

17:08.180 --> 17:09.749
and you.

17:09.752 --> 17:11.752
What, you have a laugh? No bloody way.

17:11.755 --> 17:13.521
I don't like it any more than you do.

17:13.523 --> 17:15.210
But, Bruce, you have to trust me.

17:15.213 --> 17:16.694
Lucius and I have a plan.

17:16.696 --> 17:18.297
You know what?

17:18.300 --> 17:20.983
I don't think you're
taking me seriously enough.

17:20.987 --> 17:22.587
Well...

17:22.589 --> 17:24.454
all right.

17:24.457 --> 17:26.257
Let's see.

17:26.259 --> 17:27.992
Eeny meeny miny moe,

17:27.993 --> 17:30.828
one of these people have got to... go.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.701
Oh, it's that guy.

17:36.703 --> 17:38.302
Oh, well.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.963
Did you see what just happened?

17:40.966 --> 17:42.507
That man's a raving bloody lunatic.

17:42.509 --> 17:44.642
- He can't be trusted.
- For once I agree with Alfred.

17:44.644 --> 17:46.110
Bruce, listen to me.

17:46.112 --> 17:48.350
With your help, we can
prevent more deaths.

17:52.034 --> 17:53.366
What's the plan?

17:54.991 --> 17:57.321
Jerome is using a
shortwave radio trigger

17:57.323 --> 17:59.223
with a dead man's
switch... If we can cut

17:59.225 --> 18:01.514
the signal, he won't be able
to activate the explosives.

18:01.517 --> 18:03.444
This emits a powerful
signal that disables

18:03.447 --> 18:05.014
all radio waves close to it.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.451
Once within a few feet of
Jerome's device, his trigger

18:07.454 --> 18:09.122
- will be useless.
- That will give us the time

18:09.124 --> 18:10.527
for the snipers to get a clean shot

18:10.530 --> 18:11.983
on Jerome, Firefly and the others.

18:11.986 --> 18:13.969
If I wear this, that gives
you time to take them out.

18:13.971 --> 18:15.038
Correct.

18:15.041 --> 18:16.841
Are you sure it's gonna work?

18:16.843 --> 18:18.176
I'm positive.

18:19.428 --> 18:20.827
99% positive.

18:22.342 --> 18:23.808
What are we waiting for?

18:23.811 --> 18:25.349
Those people need our help.

18:25.351 --> 18:26.984
Good man.

18:31.541 --> 18:35.326
Ra's owned this house for as
long as this city has existed.

18:35.328 --> 18:37.865
He said he kept his secrets in here.

18:37.868 --> 18:40.331
Ancient secrets.

18:40.333 --> 18:43.701
None of us have ever seen
what's behind this door.

18:43.703 --> 18:45.503
It remains locked,

18:45.505 --> 18:47.905
and there is no key.

18:47.907 --> 18:49.478
Tried dynamite?

18:51.917 --> 18:53.250
No need.

18:58.218 --> 18:59.829
Our master chose you

18:59.832 --> 19:01.719
for a reason.

20:08.955 --> 20:11.122
All my life...

20:11.124 --> 20:14.992
I have known that I was meant for more.

20:14.994 --> 20:18.053
That there was something
deep inside of me

20:18.056 --> 20:19.997
that I couldn't explain.

20:36.712 --> 20:38.816
I'm home.

20:48.071 --> 20:51.195
Sir, we got target in sight.

20:51.197 --> 20:53.331
No way in from below the stage.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.066
Four of my men have found positions.

20:55.068 --> 20:56.040
Good.

20:56.043 --> 20:57.672
Stay low, hang tight.

20:57.675 --> 20:59.170
No hair triggers.

20:59.172 --> 21:01.639
One missed shot means adios Mayor.

21:01.641 --> 21:03.574
Copy that.

21:03.576 --> 21:05.309
Standing by.

21:05.311 --> 21:07.240
I watch the news.

21:07.243 --> 21:08.790
I know why you're here, Mr. Gordon.

21:08.793 --> 21:10.644
And you must be out of
your mind if you think

21:10.647 --> 21:12.813
I'm gonna be led like
a lamb to slaughter.

21:12.816 --> 21:15.986
I understand your concern,
but your brother doesn't bluff.

21:15.989 --> 21:17.484
If we ignore his demands,

21:17.487 --> 21:19.126
there's no telling what he might do.

21:19.129 --> 21:21.825
- We can block his remote's signal with this.
- Thanks.

21:21.828 --> 21:24.134
If you and Bruce can get
within a few feet of him,

21:24.137 --> 21:26.571
it will disable his remote...
He'll be a sitting duck.

21:26.574 --> 21:29.332
- Our snipers can take it from there.
- For God's sake, Gordon,

21:29.335 --> 21:31.068
you have to know what he wants.

21:31.070 --> 21:33.437
To... murder us both

21:33.439 --> 21:35.506
on live television.

21:35.508 --> 21:37.575
Mr. Valeska.

21:37.577 --> 21:39.210
I'm Bruce Wayne.

21:39.212 --> 21:41.212
It's a pleasure to meet you.

21:41.214 --> 21:44.873
Likewise. I... wish the
circumstances were better.

21:44.876 --> 21:47.019
May I ask what it is
you've been working on?

21:48.287 --> 21:49.532
Um, yeah.

21:49.535 --> 21:51.521
It's a compact electrical engine.

21:51.524 --> 21:52.923
It generates power.

21:52.925 --> 21:54.204
Fascinating.

21:54.207 --> 21:55.415
How much power?

21:55.418 --> 21:57.027
Just two could light up every building

21:57.030 --> 21:58.629
south of Westward Bridge.

21:58.631 --> 22:01.098
You have a brilliant mind.

22:01.100 --> 22:03.300
And we all hope we can soon

22:03.302 --> 22:05.102
be rid of your brother,
so that you can carry out

22:05.104 --> 22:06.704
your work free from fear.

22:06.706 --> 22:09.032
I understand if you choose
not to help us today.

22:09.035 --> 22:12.308
But I trust that Captain
Gordon and Mr. Fox

22:12.311 --> 22:14.111
will see that no harm comes to me.

22:14.113 --> 22:16.680
But even if it does...

22:18.409 --> 22:20.274
maybe, by facing Jerome...

22:21.754 --> 22:23.454
I can show the people of Gotham

22:23.456 --> 22:24.889
that standing up to terror

22:24.891 --> 22:27.149
is the only way to take its power away.

22:36.903 --> 22:39.270
Well said.

22:42.975 --> 22:44.313
Harvey?

22:44.316 --> 22:45.865
Hey. Just got word

22:45.867 --> 22:47.373
that Freeze and Scarecrow broke into

22:47.376 --> 22:49.099
Wayne Industries' chemical lab.

22:49.102 --> 22:50.431
Jerome's playing the long game, here,

22:50.433 --> 22:51.649
but we're not gonna be sure what it is

22:51.651 --> 22:53.818
- unless we get ahead of him.
- The gas.

22:53.820 --> 22:56.318
Penguin told me about
a new Scarecrow toxin.

22:56.321 --> 22:58.622
Head over to the lab, we're
on our way to the Square.

23:00.259 --> 23:01.659
They've got a weapon.

23:01.661 --> 23:03.360
Poison gas.

23:03.362 --> 23:05.596
Okay, let's go.

23:05.598 --> 23:07.098
Thank you.

23:13.206 --> 23:14.738
You two.

23:21.047 --> 23:22.680
Hey!

23:22.682 --> 23:23.814
Hey, buddy.

23:23.816 --> 23:25.783
What happened?

23:25.785 --> 23:26.996
What's so funny?

23:26.999 --> 23:28.498
No, no, no, no, no!

23:31.290 --> 23:33.057
Ma'am.

23:33.059 --> 23:34.625
Let me help you.

23:34.627 --> 23:35.726
What happened?

23:35.728 --> 23:37.161
They made us make it.

23:37.163 --> 23:38.418
Tons of it.

23:38.421 --> 23:39.558
Where is it?

23:39.561 --> 23:40.631
It's gone.

23:40.633 --> 23:41.999
They took it.

23:43.836 --> 23:46.070
♪ Why are we waiting? ♪

23:46.072 --> 23:47.885
♪ Waiting, waiting,
waiting, waiting ♪

23:47.888 --> 23:49.579
♪ Someone's gonna die! ♪

23:51.077 --> 23:52.810
Well.

23:52.812 --> 23:55.713
Look who decided to show up.

23:55.715 --> 23:58.215
We were starting to get nervous.

23:58.217 --> 23:59.817
Especially, the mayor here.

23:59.819 --> 24:01.852
My guests of honor,

24:01.854 --> 24:05.152
please, take your seats onstage.

24:15.201 --> 24:16.734
Come on.

24:16.736 --> 24:18.569
Don't be shy.

24:18.571 --> 24:20.137
It's all right.

24:25.611 --> 24:27.558
We don't have all day.

24:34.086 --> 24:37.421
It's activated, just let
them get a little closer.

24:37.423 --> 24:39.523
On my command.

24:39.525 --> 24:42.793
My men have all targets in view.

24:42.795 --> 24:44.512
Standing by.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.387
Hi, brother.

25:03.482 --> 25:05.301
- Now.
- Fire.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.970
All targets, fire!

25:13.926 --> 25:17.494
I had my guys take up the
best vantage points last night.

25:17.496 --> 25:22.402
So they've been watching
your little SWAT team all day.

25:24.924 --> 25:28.259
Now, Bruce, brother dear.

25:28.262 --> 25:30.374
Get up onstage.

25:32.262 --> 25:34.644
It's time to get this
party really started, huh?

25:41.599 --> 25:43.084
What are you doing here?

25:43.087 --> 25:44.982
This is a restricted area.

25:44.985 --> 25:47.953
Our cargo is too precious to waste.

25:49.824 --> 25:52.472
Let me give you something I like to keep

25:52.475 --> 25:55.260
up my sleeves for times just like these.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.834
Oh, my God!

26:01.836 --> 26:04.336
You can pilot this
contraption alone, sir?

26:04.338 --> 26:05.604
Yes.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.806
Then, look into my eyes.

26:14.682 --> 26:18.317
The kidnappings, the
concert in the Square.

26:18.319 --> 26:19.952
All to draw the biggest crowds,

26:19.954 --> 26:21.954
so we can drop the laughing gas on them?

26:21.956 --> 26:24.272
This is madness.

26:24.275 --> 26:25.674
I thought

26:25.677 --> 26:28.693
you'd appreciate the beauty of it all.

26:28.696 --> 26:30.662
But Jerome was right.

26:30.664 --> 26:33.799
You know, he anticipated your betrayal?

26:33.801 --> 26:35.191
That's right.

26:35.194 --> 26:37.102
You went to Gordon.

26:38.639 --> 26:39.705
Judas.

26:41.444 --> 26:43.175
Tie him up,

26:43.177 --> 26:45.053
put him on the blimp.

26:45.056 --> 26:46.488
Jerome wants him to have

26:46.491 --> 26:48.147
a bird's-eye view.

26:54.051 --> 26:57.755
This book tracks Ra's legacy
dating back nine centuries.

26:57.758 --> 27:00.025
Did you know he not only
overthrew governments,

27:00.027 --> 27:02.094
but infiltrated royal families?

27:02.096 --> 27:04.663
Ra's influenced history.

27:04.665 --> 27:08.500
He was a cult leader, and he
still has them brainwashed.

27:08.502 --> 27:10.602
And what about me, am I brainwashed?

27:10.604 --> 27:12.584
There are things written here

27:12.587 --> 27:16.107
that could change the way
we view the past forever.

27:16.110 --> 27:19.928
Perhaps, I am the one to
bring that change to light.

27:22.028 --> 27:26.370
Look. This book was compiled
by shamans and mystics

27:26.373 --> 27:28.420
from all over Eastern
Asia and the Middle East.

27:28.422 --> 27:30.436
Shamans and mystics? Give me a break.

27:30.439 --> 27:33.424
It contains formulas for
potions and incantations

27:33.427 --> 27:34.860
said to raise demons,

27:34.862 --> 27:37.095
curse our enemies and contact the dead.

27:37.097 --> 27:38.272
This isn't you.

27:38.275 --> 27:39.576
The Barbara I know would've already sold

27:39.578 --> 27:41.232
all of this junk to the highest bidder.

27:41.235 --> 27:42.316
Junk?

27:42.319 --> 27:44.469
This is my destiny.

27:44.471 --> 27:46.238
And being with me and
Selina at the club?

27:46.240 --> 27:47.372
That isn't?

27:47.374 --> 27:49.041
You begged me

27:49.043 --> 27:50.350
to partner with you.

27:50.353 --> 27:52.066
Can't you see who that is up there?

27:52.069 --> 27:54.795
That is me and Ra's, 400 years ago.

27:54.798 --> 27:56.855
Oh, please, I mean, she
doesn't even look like you.

27:56.858 --> 27:58.397
It looks exactly like me.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.885
It is me.

27:59.887 --> 28:03.555
I have finally found my true purpose.

28:03.557 --> 28:06.061
I'm not gonna let your
jealousy distract me.

28:06.064 --> 28:09.627
Ladies, escort Miss
Galavan to the street.

28:09.630 --> 28:11.430
I'll show myself out.

28:11.432 --> 28:13.398
Actually, I think it's time

28:13.400 --> 28:16.435
my loyal servants
taught you some manners.

28:16.437 --> 28:17.616
Why don't you do it?

28:17.619 --> 28:20.225
Because I am the one true heir

28:20.228 --> 28:24.064
of an immortal god's ancient dynasty.

28:24.067 --> 28:27.397
And I don't dirty my fingers
with the likes of you anymore.

28:38.741 --> 28:40.626
No parent will admit it,

28:40.628 --> 28:44.296
but everyone's got their favorites.

28:44.298 --> 28:46.231
Right, brother?

28:51.717 --> 28:55.507
The one who cleans their
room, does their homework,

28:55.509 --> 28:57.509
doesn't try to kill everybody.

28:57.511 --> 28:59.878
Little Mr. Perfect here.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.346
Yeah.

29:01.348 --> 29:02.856
He was that guy.

29:02.858 --> 29:05.217
He got adopted by rich folks.

29:05.219 --> 29:06.662
Went to the top schools,

29:06.665 --> 29:08.220
then, a top college.

29:08.222 --> 29:10.245
Meanwhile, I got dragged

29:10.248 --> 29:13.123
through the circus by my
depressed alcoholic mother.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.636
Forced to clean up
elephant dung every day.

29:15.638 --> 29:17.144
Who cares?!

29:17.147 --> 29:18.797
Do you know how big

29:18.799 --> 29:20.540
those things are, folks?

29:20.542 --> 29:22.801
But I know something

29:22.803 --> 29:25.600
that Mommy and Daddy,

29:25.603 --> 29:27.520
they never knew.

29:29.084 --> 29:32.162
You're as crazy as I am.

29:38.762 --> 29:41.688
It's in your DNA.

29:44.658 --> 29:48.560
See, we got the same blood

29:48.562 --> 29:50.061
running through us.

29:50.064 --> 29:53.831
We are practically identical.

29:53.834 --> 29:57.002
You are a killer.

29:57.004 --> 29:58.837
It's your nature.

30:01.008 --> 30:02.541
Stop trying to fight it.

30:15.659 --> 30:18.686
Take your best shot. Hmm...

30:26.850 --> 30:28.358
Hey! What the hell happened?

30:28.361 --> 30:29.536
The snipers are dead.

30:29.539 --> 30:31.475
Get up on the roof,
take as many as you can.

30:31.478 --> 30:33.547
All right. Just know, a bunch of
chemicals are heading this way.

30:33.549 --> 30:35.874
Scarecrow had the Wayne
chemists mix it up.

30:37.978 --> 30:39.467
That's why he's been stalling.

30:39.470 --> 30:41.454
He wants a big crowd. He's gonna release

30:41.457 --> 30:43.123
the laughing gas right here.

30:43.125 --> 30:44.925
We need to evacuate the area!

30:44.927 --> 30:46.553
Get these people out of here!

30:46.556 --> 30:48.823
Do whatever you have
to! Get them out of here!

30:48.826 --> 30:51.498
It's time to kill this
maniac once and for all.

30:55.299 --> 30:56.995
That was so good!

30:56.998 --> 30:58.534
I love you!

31:36.986 --> 31:39.225
Hey, look up in the sky!

32:07.408 --> 32:08.807
Holy crap.

32:09.878 --> 32:12.610
E-Excuse me, sir, could you help me?

32:12.613 --> 32:15.113
No can do, sport.

32:15.115 --> 32:18.884
Got to get this rig into
position for the boss.

32:18.886 --> 32:20.952
And where is that?

32:20.954 --> 32:23.388
Paisley Square.

32:23.390 --> 32:25.924
Almost there.

32:25.926 --> 32:28.427
Then, I can drop the load.

32:28.429 --> 32:30.473
With this lever.

32:34.660 --> 32:37.017
Now, you turn this
thing around right now!

32:37.020 --> 32:38.804
Can you not see...

32:38.806 --> 32:41.168
Like I said, pal,

32:41.171 --> 32:43.718
no can do.

33:01.161 --> 33:02.594
Keep coming!

33:02.596 --> 33:04.801
Get into position.

33:10.113 --> 33:12.380
Holy moly.

33:13.172 --> 33:16.207
Holy moly.

33:16.210 --> 33:17.762
Jim, are you seeing this?

33:17.765 --> 33:19.599
Yeah. Get everyone out of here.

33:19.602 --> 33:21.277
I'm going after Jerome.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.647
I can take it down with a shot.

33:23.650 --> 33:25.317
And risk spilling the chemicals?

33:25.320 --> 33:27.687
Oh, yeah, right.

33:34.733 --> 33:36.185
Oswald?

33:36.188 --> 33:37.821
Jim, Jim, help me.

33:37.824 --> 33:40.935
They knocked me out and-and-and
now I am in some blimp

33:40.938 --> 33:43.667
with-with that horrible
gas and-and the pilot,

33:43.670 --> 33:45.860
he's been hypnotized and I-I don't...

33:45.863 --> 33:47.038
You're on the blimp?

33:47.040 --> 33:48.106
Yes.

33:48.108 --> 33:49.641
Yes. You have to help me.

33:49.643 --> 33:51.660
No, no, no.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.262
You're gonna help us.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.691
You're near the river.

33:54.694 --> 33:56.441
I need you to steer it over there.

33:57.818 --> 34:00.886
Steer a blimp?!

34:00.888 --> 34:02.785
Are you out of your mind, Jim?!

34:02.788 --> 34:04.720
I don't even drive my own car.

34:04.723 --> 34:07.777
If you don't, thousands
will die, maybe worse.

34:07.780 --> 34:09.994
What's worse than that?

34:09.996 --> 34:13.264
How can you run an empire
in a city full of lunatics?

34:20.407 --> 34:21.806
Hands up.

34:24.402 --> 34:27.344
Beautiful, isn't she?

34:31.685 --> 34:33.723
Just give me a second.

34:33.726 --> 34:34.855
Got to call the pilot.

34:34.858 --> 34:36.157
Tell him he's in position.

34:37.312 --> 34:39.420
Yes, Jerome.

34:39.424 --> 34:40.629
Not cool.

34:40.632 --> 34:42.994
Jerome? Jerome?

34:42.996 --> 34:45.676
I'm in position.

34:45.679 --> 34:47.545
It doesn't matter.

34:49.585 --> 34:51.284
Too late, anyway.

34:51.288 --> 34:52.453
Bombs away!

34:59.214 --> 35:00.935
Funny.

35:06.587 --> 35:08.386
No!

35:26.940 --> 35:29.708
Okay, okay. Uh... um, up, up, up.

35:29.710 --> 35:33.245
Up, up, up. Oh! Oh...

35:35.491 --> 35:37.449
Oh, okay.

35:37.451 --> 35:39.481
Okay. Okay. Okay.

35:39.484 --> 35:42.832
River, river. Where is the river?

35:48.662 --> 35:51.496
Quite the dilemma, Jim.

35:51.498 --> 35:53.932
You gonna let me fall and die?

35:55.602 --> 35:58.441
Or are you gonna pull
me up and arrest me?

36:00.941 --> 36:02.551
What's it gonna be?

36:05.277 --> 36:08.678
Lawman or murderer?

36:16.290 --> 36:17.689
Ah.

36:19.210 --> 36:20.831
Good ol' Gordon.

36:20.834 --> 36:23.460
Always playing by the rules.

36:23.463 --> 36:27.465
That's why I'll outlive you.

36:27.467 --> 36:29.137
That's why I'm loved

36:29.140 --> 36:32.336
'cause I don't give a
damn about the rules.

36:32.339 --> 36:34.520
It's a long way down.

36:34.523 --> 36:36.066
You sure you'll outlive me?

36:36.069 --> 36:37.981
Oh, I'm sure

36:37.984 --> 36:40.168
'cause I'm more than a man.

36:40.171 --> 36:43.657
I'm an idea, a philosophy.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.988
And I will live on in the shadows

36:45.991 --> 36:48.356
within Gotham's discontent.

36:53.627 --> 36:55.660
You'll be seeing me soon.

36:55.662 --> 36:57.629
Au revoir.

37:15.188 --> 37:16.920
Never thought I'd see this.

37:16.923 --> 37:17.989
Sure is dead.

37:17.992 --> 37:19.425
Yeah, but is he?

37:19.428 --> 37:22.162
Yeah.

37:22.165 --> 37:24.599
Get back!

37:24.602 --> 37:26.635
GCPD. Everybody get back.

37:57.253 --> 38:00.621
Mr. Valeska.

38:00.623 --> 38:03.324
I meant what I said about
your work being of importance

38:03.326 --> 38:05.974
to this city.

38:05.977 --> 38:08.584
Let Wayne Enterprises fund
your work with a grant.

38:13.146 --> 38:14.927
Thank you.

38:28.284 --> 38:30.318
Captain.

38:37.494 --> 38:39.427
Oswald.

38:39.429 --> 38:42.990
Um, hello. Still here.

38:42.993 --> 38:46.434
Will someone please get me
the hell off of this thing?

38:48.972 --> 38:50.615
Uh, we're on it.

38:53.376 --> 38:56.210
How do we get a blimp down
safely from over a river?

38:56.212 --> 38:58.112
You asking me? I say we let him

38:58.114 --> 39:00.107
stew up there for a few more hours.

39:01.517 --> 39:04.107
We'll get ahold of the standby pilot.

39:04.110 --> 39:05.339
Have him advise.

39:05.342 --> 39:06.708
Sit tight, all right?

39:06.711 --> 39:10.212
Oh, and Oswald Cobblepot,

39:10.215 --> 39:11.615
Gotham thanks you.

39:11.618 --> 39:12.917
Wait, wait, Jim.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.828
Jim. Jim?

39:14.831 --> 39:17.732
Jim. Jim!

39:17.734 --> 39:21.209
Jim...!

39:28.050 --> 39:29.943
Never touch me again.

39:29.946 --> 39:32.145
Miss Kean has a new path to take now.

39:32.148 --> 39:34.081
It no longer involves you.

39:34.083 --> 39:36.317
- Is that so?
- We will accept you leaving this city

39:36.319 --> 39:37.779
and never coming back.

39:37.782 --> 39:40.459
The only thing I'll accept
is you kissing my ass.

39:40.462 --> 39:42.556
We have been trained
by the League of Shadows

39:42.559 --> 39:44.451
in 90 different forms of combat

39:44.454 --> 39:46.545
- since we were five years old.
- Oh, yeah?

39:46.548 --> 39:48.795
Which one of you bitches
wants to go first?

40:04.380 --> 40:05.713
Next time

40:05.715 --> 40:07.209
we kill you.

40:26.956 --> 40:28.722
Let me help you.

40:39.286 --> 40:41.047
Who the hell are you guys?

40:41.050 --> 40:42.650
The ones that have been watching you

40:42.652 --> 40:45.706
and Barbara Kean, the
imposter, for quite some time.

40:45.709 --> 40:48.556
We serve the one and only true master,

40:48.558 --> 40:50.558
Ra's al Ghul.

40:50.560 --> 40:52.593
But he's dead.

40:52.595 --> 40:54.825
Death is only an illusion.

40:54.828 --> 40:56.194
Aah.

42:18.618 --> 42:20.680
Hello, brother.

42:20.683 --> 42:22.984
Didn't think you could
get rid of me so easily,

42:22.986 --> 42:24.518
did you?

42:24.520 --> 42:27.503
See, my days were numbered,

42:27.506 --> 42:29.156
but you...

42:29.158 --> 42:32.826
oh, you will continue on for me,

42:32.829 --> 42:35.167
be my ultimate revenge.

42:35.170 --> 42:38.432
So... calm yourself.

42:38.434 --> 42:39.934
Don't fight it.

42:39.936 --> 42:41.943
Breathe it in.

42:41.946 --> 42:44.739
This gas was a special
mixture I had made

42:44.741 --> 42:46.670
just for you.

42:46.673 --> 42:50.110
Something to finally set you free.

42:50.113 --> 42:53.018
It's time to have some fun.

42:53.021 --> 42:55.416
Burn it down, brother.

42:55.418 --> 42:58.117
Burn it all down.
