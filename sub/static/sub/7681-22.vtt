01:39.007 --> 01:41.801
Anton! Anton!

01:45.180 --> 01:47.680
Anton Dubcek.

01:48.016 --> 01:50.516
Viera!

02:03.573 --> 02:06.617
Anton! Anton!

02:09.829 --> 02:12.329
That's Anton Dubcek.

02:13.249 --> 02:15.250
This is his wife, Viera.

02:15.251 --> 02:17.669
Were these taken in Czechoslovakia?

02:17.670 --> 02:20.297
Right. He heads a group there
called Humanity.

02:20.298 --> 02:23.466
He organized it and Ied it,
fighting for human rights,

02:23.467 --> 02:26.177
until he was arrested four days ago.

02:26.178 --> 02:28.179
- By these two beauties.
- Yeah.

02:28.180 --> 02:32.180
Yevgeny Zorkin and Emil Baranov,
GRU agents.

02:32.268 --> 02:34.394
Soviet military intelligence.

02:34.395 --> 02:37.731
They took Dubcek,
but Iet his wife, Viera, go.

02:37.732 --> 02:39.524
Did his wife get you the pictures?

02:39.525 --> 02:41.443
No, they came to us
from the person

02:41.444 --> 02:43.862
who actually shot them and
smuggled them out of the country.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.822
Well, they're not bad.
I'd Iike to meet him.

02:45.823 --> 02:48.409
Well, you got it.

02:50.661 --> 02:53.037
- Hello, MacGyver.
- Diana.

02:53.038 --> 02:55.898
- Long time.
- Not Iong enough.

02:56.417 --> 02:58.917
MacGyver. MacGyver, wait.

02:59.128 --> 03:01.588
MacGyver, just Iisten to the deal,
as a favour to me.

03:01.589 --> 03:03.006
What, one of her deals?

03:03.007 --> 03:05.842
That's not a favour,
that's a human sacrifice.

03:05.843 --> 03:07.468
Do you have any idea
what I went through

03:07.469 --> 03:09.387
on that embassy deal with her?

03:09.388 --> 03:11.556
That was three years ago,
MacGyver. History.

03:11.557 --> 03:14.600
Besides, the Pentagon was very happy
about getting those documents.

03:14.601 --> 03:18.396
- What about the money you took?
- The Pentagon has enough money.

03:18.397 --> 03:20.606
Now, Iet's talk about this project,
shall we?

03:20.607 --> 03:23.484
Private investors have put up
one-half million dollars

03:23.485 --> 03:26.070
to see Anton Dubcek
safely in the United States.

03:26.071 --> 03:28.571
We split it fifty-fifty.

03:28.907 --> 03:31.407
Not interested.

03:31.743 --> 03:34.704
MacGyver, this isn't about
documents or money.

03:34.705 --> 03:36.581
It's about a human Iife.

03:36.582 --> 03:38.708
Dubcek is being held
in the psychiatric ward

03:38.709 --> 03:40.626
of a state hospital
in Czechoslovakia.

03:40.627 --> 03:44.255
This is a rogue operation.
Soviet hardliners and the GRU.

03:44.256 --> 03:47.091
They wanna discredit him
and then maybe even kill him.

03:47.092 --> 03:50.261
Shouldn't somebody be talking to
the Soviet government about all this?

03:50.262 --> 03:52.430
They won't admit they've got
people out of control

03:52.431 --> 03:54.181
in their top military intelligence.

03:54.182 --> 03:56.976
And by the time they straighten it out,
Dubcek could be dead.

03:56.977 --> 04:00.146
This operation has got to be
unofficial and fast.

04:00.147 --> 04:02.231
You've got
a professional mercenary here.

04:02.232 --> 04:03.441
What do you need me for?

04:03.442 --> 04:05.860
Because you know the hospital
where he's being held.

04:05.861 --> 04:08.279
You broke a man out of there
Iast year.

04:08.280 --> 04:10.281
You're the only expert around.

04:10.282 --> 04:13.242
Without you, the deal won't fly.

04:15.453 --> 04:17.036
AII right, you don't Iike me.

04:17.038 --> 04:19.290
I did pull a fast one on you once.

04:19.291 --> 04:23.836
But I promise, scout's honour,
we're partners this time.

04:23.837 --> 04:26.337
No games.

04:27.215 --> 04:29.591
Well, which would you rather save,
MacGyver?

04:29.592 --> 04:32.971
Your pride or a man's Iife?

04:41.813 --> 04:43.814
How do we get in?

04:43.815 --> 04:47.943
By airplane to Vienna,
and then car into Czechoslovakia.

04:47.944 --> 04:51.914
You'II be travelling
as a honeymoon couple.

04:54.993 --> 04:57.933
- MacGyver.
- What is it, Diana?

04:59.080 --> 05:01.999
You gonna carry me over the threshold
when we get to the hotel?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.208
Forget it.

05:03.209 --> 05:06.545
We don't have to start the honeymoon
stuff till we get to the Czech border.

05:06.546 --> 05:08.880
So first things first.

05:08.881 --> 05:10.757
Where do we meet
this contact of yours?

05:10.758 --> 05:12.134
You mean Krug.

05:12.135 --> 05:16.155
He's waiting for us
at the honeymoon suite.

05:20.351 --> 05:24.896
So tell me, why are you going
into Czechoslovakia?

05:24.897 --> 05:27.149
I never miss
the Prague FIower Festival.

05:27.150 --> 05:28.358
Now, put a cork in it.

05:28.359 --> 05:31.278
I'm paying you to get us across
the border, not ask questions.

05:31.279 --> 05:33.863
Diana, have I ever failed you?

05:33.864 --> 05:37.200
I have the papers.
I've made the arrangements.

05:37.201 --> 05:40.561
I'm simply filling the empty moments.

05:40.830 --> 05:43.400
Prepare yourselves. Be ready.

05:43.874 --> 05:46.464
We are coming to the border.

05:46.794 --> 05:49.629
We're ready. You do your job,
we'II do ours, Krug.

05:49.630 --> 05:53.550
I'm sure you will, Diana.
Okay, here we are.

05:53.551 --> 05:56.053
Time for the honeymoon, ja?

05:58.639 --> 06:01.869
- Lucky fellow.
- Oh, can it, Krug.

06:41.390 --> 06:43.890
Welcome to Czechoslovakia.

07:23.598 --> 07:25.975
- Your auto is there.
- Where?

07:25.976 --> 07:29.436
Behind the trees, out of sight,
with gasoline.

07:29.437 --> 07:33.537
And the papers and a picnic Iunch.
The best.

07:36.444 --> 07:38.944
First.

07:48.665 --> 07:51.125
You get the rest here at 5:00
when you meet us.

07:51.126 --> 07:54.002
- What if you are not here?
- Send flowers.

07:54.003 --> 07:56.630
So the bridegroom
does have a voice.

07:56.631 --> 07:59.842
- And he speaks English.
- Once in a while.

07:59.843 --> 08:03.093
- We'II see you at 5, huh?
- Good.

08:05.265 --> 08:07.516
Nice guy. You trust him?

08:07.517 --> 08:13.207
You know me better than that,
MacGyver. I don't trust anybody.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.612
That's what you ordered?

08:20.613 --> 08:23.907
I wanted something
that wouldn't attract attention.

08:23.908 --> 08:26.243
Even when they see us pushing it
down a highway?

08:26.244 --> 08:27.744
Don't be negative, MacGyver.

08:27.745 --> 08:29.746
Now, Iook,
I've worked with Krug before.

08:29.747 --> 08:31.373
He's a thief, he's a Iiar,

08:31.374 --> 08:35.634
but when you give him money,
he comes through.

08:45.554 --> 08:47.764
AII right, the battery's dead.
Or a fuse blew.

08:47.765 --> 08:50.016
Or it shorted. Do something.

08:50.017 --> 08:51.685
What?

08:51.686 --> 08:53.395
You're the one who picked
the embassy Iock

08:53.396 --> 08:55.897
with the Iight-bulb filament
and ground-up pencil Iead.

08:55.898 --> 08:57.857
You're also the one who shorted
an alarm system

08:57.858 --> 09:00.235
with a chewing-gum wrapper
and a half a Iemon.

09:00.236 --> 09:01.820
Come on.

09:01.821 --> 09:05.657
AII right. I suppose
there's something I could try.

09:05.658 --> 09:08.369
MacGyver, what are you doing?

09:13.374 --> 09:15.874
Worked.

09:17.336 --> 09:19.671
For a minute, I thought you were
putting the moves on me.

09:19.672 --> 09:21.673
Don't flatter yourself.

09:21.674 --> 09:24.584
You always were a smooth talker.

09:50.327 --> 09:53.287
It's a public hospital, so there's traffic
that moves in and out.

09:53.288 --> 09:57.708
Yeah, but there's tight internal security.
Four gates, and they all got guards.

09:57.709 --> 10:00.920
Yeah, but once we get inside, we can
move freely around all the buildings.

10:00.921 --> 10:03.255
And that's when we head over here
to the psychiatric wing.

10:03.256 --> 10:04.924
- That's where Dubcek is.
- Right.

10:04.925 --> 10:07.093
Psychiatric ward, cell eight.

10:07.094 --> 10:11.194
Now, we can cut through the fence
over here.

10:36.164 --> 10:38.666
Where'd you Iearn how
to speak Czech?

10:38.667 --> 10:41.167
Correspondence school.

10:42.003 --> 10:44.673
Like "Czech is in the mail"?

10:45.715 --> 10:48.801
Now, Iook.
We cut through the fence here.

10:48.802 --> 10:50.677
And set off the perimeter alarms?

10:50.678 --> 10:53.138
Why don't we just drive right in,

10:53.139 --> 10:55.891
head for the psychiatric ward.
They've got a medical Iab there

10:55.892 --> 10:59.144
with about everything we need
to cook up a Iittle diversion.

10:59.145 --> 11:03.649
"Cook up"? I have arranged
a very detailed plan here.

11:03.650 --> 11:08.528
Yeah, and every one of those details
is just another thing that can go wrong.

11:08.529 --> 11:12.199
- What's that for?
- I Iike to go in with an open mind.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.786
Kind of Ioose.
Use what they've got against them.

11:15.787 --> 11:19.081
Well, it sounds fine if you talk fast,
but how will you get through this gate?

11:19.082 --> 11:21.752
Who could refuse a dying man?

11:35.431 --> 11:39.531
We're Americans,
but my husband's been hurt.

12:04.251 --> 12:06.878
Okay, how much time do I give you?

12:06.879 --> 12:09.839
It's 11:45.
Give me 15 minutes exactly.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.424
Twelve noon on the button.

12:11.425 --> 12:15.887
Outside Dubcek's cell.
Don't come early, and don't be Iate.

12:15.888 --> 12:18.898
If I'm not there, just take off.

12:20.768 --> 12:24.646
Whatever it is you've got planned,
do it right. Stay alive.

12:24.647 --> 12:26.564
Well, thanks.
I didn't think you cared.

12:26.565 --> 12:28.942
Oh, I do. I do.

12:28.943 --> 12:32.673
My payoff depends on you
not fouling up.

12:33.113 --> 12:35.613
Thanks.

13:01.225 --> 13:05.144
One thing I had going for me
was I'd been here before.

13:05.145 --> 13:06.687
Nothing had changed.

13:06.688 --> 13:11.028
They still had an armed guard
and locked doors.

13:18.825 --> 13:21.625
The problem was how to get in.

13:22.621 --> 13:25.791
But the food cart gave me an idea.

13:39.012 --> 13:42.181
Now all I had to do was whip up
something special for them to serve

13:42.182 --> 13:44.882
along with this hospital food.

13:54.235 --> 13:56.935
Good. Schedule hasn't changed.

13:57.447 --> 13:59.865
As I remember,
the hospital staff breaks for lunch

13:59.866 --> 14:02.034
before they serve the patients.

14:02.035 --> 14:08.915
So I figure I had about six minutes
to put together some kind of diversion.

14:16.466 --> 14:18.342
Carbon black.

14:18.343 --> 14:22.304
Scatter it in the air and I'd have
a nice cloud of dirty smoke.

14:22.305 --> 14:25.715
I just needed some way to deliver it.

14:33.775 --> 14:35.192
Good.

14:35.193 --> 14:37.693
Now for a container.

16:17.794 --> 16:20.713
It's kind of interesting how you can
put one thing with another

16:20.714 --> 16:24.842
and cook up the right formula
for staying out of trouble.

16:24.843 --> 16:27.303
My old high school
physics and chemistry classes

16:27.304 --> 16:29.722
come in real handy sometimes.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.683
Not to mention the fact that
when you're in a squeeze,

16:32.684 --> 16:34.810
necessity always seems
to come through

16:34.811 --> 16:37.721
as the true mother of invention.

16:45.780 --> 16:47.906
I needed a diversion.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.450
And a smoke bomb seemed like

16:49.451 --> 16:53.741
the right thing to use
under the circumstances.

17:07.594 --> 17:10.804
The idea I was playing with
was to use the lid on these potatoes

17:10.805 --> 17:13.305
as the primary trigger.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.522
The problem was...

17:21.523 --> 17:24.834
...getting somebody else
to pull it.

17:29.741 --> 17:32.909
Well, I had a way
in to the psychiatric ward.

17:32.910 --> 17:35.410
I just needed a way out.

17:44.630 --> 17:48.758
Nitro tablets.
For jump-starting a bad heart.

17:48.759 --> 17:51.259
They'll do just fine.

18:05.109 --> 18:09.070
Each tablet contains a measurable
amount of nitro-glycerine.

18:09.071 --> 18:10.613
The best way I had of getting to it

18:10.614 --> 18:14.294
was by crushing the tablets
into powder.

18:20.791 --> 18:23.918
Add a little alcohol,
and I'll jump Anton Dubcek

18:23.919 --> 18:26.619
right through his cell window.

18:32.761 --> 18:35.571
Explosive nitro-glycerine paste.

18:35.639 --> 18:37.390
Very unstable.

18:37.391 --> 18:40.271
A hard sneeze could set it off.

19:05.586 --> 19:07.003
All right.

19:07.004 --> 19:09.964
I had a nitro bomb
and a smoke bomb.

19:09.965 --> 19:13.009
Anybody bumped into me
too hard...

19:13.010 --> 19:15.550
... well, it'd be memorable.

19:16.680 --> 19:21.840
Now all I needed was the right kind
of delivery uniform.

22:43.844 --> 22:46.303
Mr. Dubcek.

22:46.304 --> 22:48.804
Mr. Dubcek.

22:50.809 --> 22:53.659
I'm gonna get you out of here.

23:47.740 --> 23:50.240
Dubcek.

24:44.797 --> 24:47.297
Go!

25:03.649 --> 25:06.149
We did it.

25:06.193 --> 25:09.695
- Welcome aboard, Mr. Dubcek.
- What? What is it?

25:09.696 --> 25:12.073
What it is is freedom.
We just broke you out.

25:12.074 --> 25:14.951
- You are Americans?
- That's right.

25:14.952 --> 25:17.328
My name's MacGyver.
This is Diana Rogers.

25:17.329 --> 25:18.871
- Hi.
- You--

25:18.872 --> 25:22.041
- You broke me out of the hospital.
- Free and clear.

25:22.042 --> 25:23.793
Now we're gonna get you
out of the country.

25:23.794 --> 25:26.754
No, dear God.
You have to take me back at once.

25:26.755 --> 25:28.923
- It is my wife.
- Your wife?

25:28.924 --> 25:30.883
Viera. They arrested her.

25:30.884 --> 25:34.387
They told me if I try to defect,
they execute her. Kill her.

25:34.388 --> 25:38.266
I beg you, take me back. PIease.

25:51.613 --> 25:54.240
- You feeling better?
- A Iittle.

25:54.241 --> 26:00.461
But when is MacGyver returning?
We have to get back before my wife--

26:22.936 --> 26:26.063
Here you go, Anton.
I got you something to wear.

26:26.064 --> 26:28.774
- Now we can both be fashion plates.
- Thank you.

26:28.775 --> 26:30.317
What did you do
with the ambulance?

26:30.318 --> 26:34.363
- Ran it off the road.
- Is this the best you could do?

26:34.364 --> 26:38.075
- Well, it's all I could afford.
- You bought this junk heap?

26:38.076 --> 26:40.285
You could've stolen something
with more muscle.

26:40.286 --> 26:42.786
I don't work that way.

26:43.414 --> 26:45.999
Anton, what do you say
we go get your wife?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.544
Thank you, MacGyver.

26:49.420 --> 26:54.716
Anton, why don't you just get into your
clothes. We'II give you some privacy.

26:54.717 --> 26:57.636
Are you nuts or just simple-minded?

26:57.637 --> 27:00.347
Well, the expert opinion
is still out on that.

27:00.348 --> 27:04.184
- She is in a GRU Iockup.
- She happens to be his wife.

27:04.185 --> 27:06.603
- She's not part of the deal.
- Let me put it this way:

27:06.604 --> 27:08.104
He won't go without her.

27:08.105 --> 27:11.066
And haven't you ever Ioved anyone
that much?

27:11.067 --> 27:14.152
- Not in my right mind.
- Then you don't have to come along.

27:14.153 --> 27:19.032
I've got no choice. Delivering that man
is worth one-half million dollars.

27:19.033 --> 27:23.328
Anton, do you know where
they're keeping your wife?

27:23.329 --> 27:26.790
Of course. The Soviets are invaders
of my country. Very visible.

27:26.791 --> 27:28.833
Good. Let's go rescue her.

27:28.834 --> 27:32.046
- Thank you, Diana.
- Anytime.

27:37.593 --> 27:39.094
That is it.

27:39.095 --> 27:41.346
Yep, that's Zorkin's GRU car.

27:41.347 --> 27:44.808
How can we ever get Viera
out of there?

27:44.809 --> 27:48.436
Oh, maybe Zorkin and Baranov
are gonna do it for us.

27:48.437 --> 27:50.897
You wanna Iet us all in
on your Iittle secret?

27:50.898 --> 27:54.192
Well, that's a holding prison,
not an interrogation centre.

27:54.193 --> 27:56.402
My guess is they'II take her out
for interrogation

27:56.403 --> 27:59.733
now that you're on the missing Iist.

28:02.701 --> 28:04.661
Boy, you sure called that one right.

28:04.662 --> 28:06.704
They're going to kill her
unless I give myself up.

28:06.705 --> 28:09.205
No.

28:14.129 --> 28:16.380
Do you have any idea
where they might be taking her?

28:16.381 --> 28:20.259
Yes, to Red Army
regional headquarters at Caslav.

28:20.260 --> 28:23.804
You know any shortcuts? So we
might be able to intercept them.

28:23.805 --> 28:26.390
To rescue Viera? Yes, of course.

28:26.391 --> 28:30.687
- How?
- We'II just Iet the GRU rescue us.

28:33.565 --> 28:36.065
SIow down. Look.

28:36.234 --> 28:38.277
Someone had an accident.

28:38.278 --> 28:41.280
- Looks Iike they're hurt.
- Stop the car, quick.

28:41.281 --> 28:43.781
Go see if they're alive.

28:53.919 --> 28:56.419
Don't even breathe.

29:02.761 --> 29:05.261
Anton!

29:17.192 --> 29:20.111
Right over here. Easy.

29:25.658 --> 29:28.994
AII right, this ought to keep you
out of trouble for a while.

29:28.995 --> 29:32.206
- Duct tape?
- Never Ieave home without it.

29:32.207 --> 29:33.957
Who are you?

29:33.958 --> 29:36.919
Like everybody else,
part of humanity.

29:36.920 --> 29:39.171
Humanity is an illegal organization.

29:39.172 --> 29:42.799
If you do not release me at once,
my superiors--

29:42.800 --> 29:45.300
Nothing personal.

29:53.311 --> 29:55.270
AII right, here we go.

29:55.271 --> 29:57.771
Nice and easy.

30:01.235 --> 30:03.955
Come on, save it for the car.

30:05.782 --> 30:08.852
- What's that for?
- Baling wire.

30:08.951 --> 30:11.745
- Can fix just about anything.
- What's to fix? We're home free.

30:11.746 --> 30:13.955
Not until we cross the border.

30:13.956 --> 30:16.541
Remember me? I Iike to stay Ioose.
Keep an open mind.

30:16.542 --> 30:19.042
Whatever makes you happy.

30:40.524 --> 30:42.776
Hello, Diana.

30:42.777 --> 30:44.402
I've been waiting for you.

30:44.403 --> 30:48.907
And I see you have acquired
more Iuxurious transportation.

30:48.908 --> 30:53.244
- Did you get your flowers?
- Yeah, they're in the back seat.

30:53.245 --> 30:54.662
So I see.

30:54.663 --> 30:58.166
And the honeymoon?
It was all that you expected?

30:58.167 --> 31:00.043
Short, but exhausting.

31:00.044 --> 31:02.546
And definitely over, ja?

31:06.050 --> 31:09.802
- What are you doing?
- Selling you, dear Iady.

31:09.803 --> 31:13.515
Sorry, but business is business.

31:24.526 --> 31:26.569
Don't move!

31:26.570 --> 31:28.196
Don't be foolish!

31:28.197 --> 31:31.991
- My friends here are superb shots.
- You're right.

31:31.992 --> 31:34.492
He can't be trusted.

31:34.745 --> 31:38.247
Do you think that baling-wire gag
of yours will really work?

31:38.248 --> 31:40.625
Yeah, it should.

31:40.626 --> 31:44.378
The ignition coil delivers
about 20,000 volts.

31:44.379 --> 31:47.798
MacGyver, that'II charge
the whole car.

31:47.799 --> 31:49.717
What happens to us?

31:49.718 --> 31:52.636
We have the rubber tires
to insulate us.

31:52.637 --> 31:56.390
They'II get a pretty good jolt.
No real damage.

31:56.391 --> 31:59.435
Now, if you will please step out
of the car,

31:59.436 --> 32:02.271
we can place an official end
to the honeymoon.

32:02.272 --> 32:05.316
Well, now, see, that poses
a real problem for us.

32:05.317 --> 32:09.653
See, if we put our hands down, these
two fine young gentlemen might shoot.

32:09.654 --> 32:15.374
They might misunderstand what
we're doing. You see our dilemma.

32:20.332 --> 32:22.832
Now.

32:24.794 --> 32:27.294
Hold it, Krug!

32:27.630 --> 32:29.965
It was amazing. Just as you said.

32:29.966 --> 32:33.469
Well, Iet's just say that precaution
paid off.

32:33.470 --> 32:37.055
You boys kind of came prepared
for a Iittle trouble, didn't you?

32:37.056 --> 32:39.558
Because there
is an alert for you.

32:39.559 --> 32:42.644
AII of you.
The border is shut down.

32:42.645 --> 32:44.980
Every post for 50 kilometres.

32:44.981 --> 32:48.984
And you are not wanted
dead or alive, my friends.

32:48.985 --> 32:51.485
Only dead.

32:57.493 --> 32:59.369
Are you sure this is a good idea?

32:59.370 --> 33:01.496
I think it's the only chance we've got.

33:01.497 --> 33:03.997
You two better get down.

33:15.636 --> 33:18.136
Krug.

33:24.228 --> 33:25.770
Where is Krug?

33:25.771 --> 33:30.551
He's all tied up,
but he told me to give you this.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.860
Go.

33:40.453 --> 33:42.953
PIease stop.

33:52.089 --> 33:56.467
MacGyver, that is wonderful.
To trick them instead of killing them.

33:56.468 --> 34:00.805
Well, it's kind of hard for a grenade to
work when you take the explosive out.

34:00.806 --> 34:05.486
Come on, we better hurry.
We got a plane to catch.

34:09.063 --> 34:11.065
On behalf of the captain and crew,

34:11.065 --> 34:13.943
we would like to welcome you
to the Los Angeles area.

34:13.944 --> 34:18.406
The time now is 2:09,
and the temperature is 78 degrees.

34:18.407 --> 34:21.159
Thank you for flying with us.

34:23.911 --> 34:28.083
MacGyver, it is beautiful!

34:28.958 --> 34:32.587
Well, thanks, Viera. I don't think
anyone's ever said that before.

34:32.588 --> 34:36.966
- I Iike it. You are very gracious.
- And thoughtful.

34:36.967 --> 34:38.551
Well, it's the Ieast we could do.

34:38.552 --> 34:40.887
There'II be a new home ready for you
sometime tomorrow,

34:40.888 --> 34:43.097
but in the meantime, it's yours.

34:43.098 --> 34:45.056
You can have a second honeymoon.

34:45.058 --> 34:47.101
Actually, we never had a first one.

34:47.101 --> 34:50.896
You remember?
I had to go off on an organizing trip.

34:50.897 --> 34:54.692
I remember.
And it is nothing to make jokes.

34:54.693 --> 34:58.213
Honeymoon?
We've had no Iife together.

34:58.947 --> 35:00.698
I'm sorry.

35:00.699 --> 35:03.493
- I am very tired.
- No.

35:04.244 --> 35:07.456
I am sorry. And thoughtless.

35:08.081 --> 35:09.915
But now we are free,

35:09.916 --> 35:13.627
- we are together, to make a new Iife.
- Absolutely.

35:13.628 --> 35:17.799
But first in the new Iife,
new clothes, no?

35:17.966 --> 35:21.302
Yes, guaranteed.
I'II even take you shopping.

35:21.303 --> 35:23.762
- It's included in the fee.
- You're on.

35:23.763 --> 35:27.308
Anton, you and I have a few miles
of red tape to untangle.

35:27.309 --> 35:28.976
No problem, but it'II take an hour.

35:28.977 --> 35:31.562
Diana, if you'II wait here,
I'II arrange for your money.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.647
You said the magic word.

35:33.648 --> 35:35.524
AII right, thank you.

35:35.525 --> 35:38.068
Well, the money is on its way over.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.320
- Wanna count it when it gets here?
- No, thanks.

35:40.321 --> 35:43.824
- Diana can handle that for both of us.
- Guaranteed.

35:43.825 --> 35:46.368
Eight-to-five she counts it twice.

35:46.369 --> 35:48.162
What are you gonna do
with your share?

35:48.163 --> 35:53.103
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe get a new roll of duct tape.

35:56.629 --> 35:59.423
- Well, are you all set?
- It was wonderful.

35:59.424 --> 36:05.804
So quick, and your Iawyer says we can
stay in U.S.A. without problems.

36:05.805 --> 36:10.101
I am Iucky beyond Iuck.

36:10.935 --> 36:14.187
But not to forget my friends,
my people back home.

36:14.188 --> 36:15.689
To help them.

36:15.690 --> 36:20.360
You realize you can be heard almost
anywhere in the world from here.

36:20.361 --> 36:24.239
And perhaps move the world,
only a Iittle.

36:24.240 --> 36:27.117
That is why we call
our group Humanity.

36:27.118 --> 36:29.704
No guns. Only people.

36:29.871 --> 36:33.207
And some dangerous ideas.

36:37.878 --> 36:40.672
I'II show you where everything is,
then get out of your way.

36:40.673 --> 36:43.383
MacGyver, you are Iike
a very discreet matchmaker.

36:43.384 --> 36:48.604
Well, somebody did say something
about a second honeymoon.

37:00.484 --> 37:02.984
Viera.

37:05.573 --> 37:07.240
MacGyver.

37:07.241 --> 37:10.368
- Are you all right? What happened?
- Viera is gone.

37:10.369 --> 37:11.953
Anton, I'm so sorry.

37:11.954 --> 37:15.164
I didn't see anything,
I didn't hear anything.

37:15.165 --> 37:16.874
She was in the bath
and I was reading.

37:16.875 --> 37:19.919
The door wasn't forced. They picked
the Iock or came in through a window.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.088
The GRU are professional.

37:22.089 --> 37:23.881
Yeah, we don't know who did it.

37:23.882 --> 37:26.382
I know.

37:31.515 --> 37:32.765
Yes?

37:32.766 --> 37:36.286
May I speak with
Anton Dubcek, please?

37:36.311 --> 37:39.438
- Who's asking?
- A dear old friend.

37:39.439 --> 37:43.359
- Zorkin.
- Anton. Good to hear your voice.

37:43.402 --> 37:45.902
Now, Iisten.

37:46.780 --> 37:49.280
Anton, please.

37:49.324 --> 37:53.744
They say they will kill me unless
you give yourself up to them.

37:53.745 --> 37:55.579
Please.

37:55.580 --> 37:58.500
PIease, I am frightened.

38:00.335 --> 38:03.295
On the other hand,
we will release her safely,

38:03.296 --> 38:06.465
to go where she wishes,
stay where she likes,

38:06.466 --> 38:08.259
in exchange for your cooperation.

38:08.260 --> 38:11.053
Be at the city zoo in one hour.

38:11.054 --> 38:12.972
We will find you.

38:12.973 --> 38:15.473
Let me talk to her.

38:20.897 --> 38:22.898
Well, there's no way
you can go along with them.

38:22.899 --> 38:25.399
Of course. You are correct.

38:26.152 --> 38:29.032
And of course I have no choice.

38:52.971 --> 38:56.306
Anton Iooks Iike he's wound up
so tight he's about to snap.

38:56.307 --> 39:01.186
Well, wouldn't you be if the woman
you Ioved were under the gun?

39:01.187 --> 39:03.522
Yeah, I guess so.

39:03.523 --> 39:07.033
I don't know why I blew up Iike that.

39:07.277 --> 39:12.327
Keep an eye on him.
I'm gonna check our agency backup.

39:16.869 --> 39:19.788
Look at him.
Three tons and a bad temper.

39:19.789 --> 39:22.082
Now, that's the way to
handle the world.

39:22.083 --> 39:24.583
Pretty tough, aren't you?

39:24.752 --> 39:29.381
Realistic. You would be too,
if you'd Iet yourself.

39:29.382 --> 39:33.062
You risk your Iife,
you deserve payment.

39:33.386 --> 39:37.626
- We earned our money, MacGyver.
- "Our money"?

39:38.516 --> 39:41.016
I'm very flattered.

39:43.896 --> 39:46.898
You're the second man
I've ever trusted.

39:46.899 --> 39:49.651
- What happened to the first?
- David.

39:49.652 --> 39:52.152
Sweet David.

39:52.238 --> 39:56.950
I met him in Europe,
right after that embassy job with you.

39:56.951 --> 39:59.160
You know, I felt really badly
about that.

39:59.161 --> 40:03.248
- Well, you never told me.
- It's because I was embarrassed.

40:03.249 --> 40:05.250
The problem was I Iiked you,
MacGyver.

40:05.251 --> 40:07.751
And I used you, and...

40:09.213 --> 40:13.341
I guess I just didn't feel
very good about myself.

40:13.342 --> 40:16.832
Maybe that's why I was
so vulnerable.

40:17.137 --> 40:20.933
- For this David?
- I Ieft myself open.

40:21.433 --> 40:25.193
- What happened?
- His name wasn't David.

40:26.647 --> 40:29.147
It was Pyotro.

40:30.025 --> 40:32.151
And he wasn't my Iover,

40:32.152 --> 40:33.945
he was KGB.

40:33.946 --> 40:35.947
Trying to get those papers back.

40:35.948 --> 40:40.678
I found out and he tried to kill me.
I was faster.

40:40.786 --> 40:43.286
And I killed him.

40:47.251 --> 40:49.751
No, I'm okay.

40:50.170 --> 40:52.670
It's over with.

40:53.340 --> 40:58.094
And right now we have something
much more important to worry about.

40:58.095 --> 41:02.275
- Just Iook at that poor man.
- Yeah, I know.

41:02.307 --> 41:05.717
Well, there's no sign of contact yet.

41:06.645 --> 41:09.730
Maybe the GRU got nervous
and backed off.

41:09.731 --> 41:12.401
Well, that's not very Iikely.

41:13.026 --> 41:16.320
Perimeter security is all set.
Anything?

41:16.321 --> 41:17.780
Nothing yet.

41:17.781 --> 41:20.371
Nobody's even come near him.

41:22.327 --> 41:25.455
Anton. No, Iook ahead.

41:25.622 --> 41:28.082
Listen, they can see us.

41:28.083 --> 41:30.583
The GRU.

41:30.835 --> 41:32.878
They have a gun aimed at me.

41:32.879 --> 41:37.091
- Where? Tell me. I will protect you.
- No, please.

41:37.092 --> 41:38.926
We must do what they say.

41:38.927 --> 41:41.427
Exactly as they say.

41:44.057 --> 41:45.849
I'II show you.

41:45.850 --> 41:48.350
MacGyver, Pete, Iook.

41:49.521 --> 41:53.171
- That's Viera.
- I think you're right.

41:55.860 --> 41:58.360
They're gone. Come on.

41:58.613 --> 42:03.383
Thornton here. Lock up
the southwest corridor. Hurry!

42:14.170 --> 42:15.379
This is the place.

42:15.380 --> 42:16.922
- They are watching now?
- Of course.

42:16.923 --> 42:19.883
Listen. MacGyver, Pete
and Diane are here.

42:19.884 --> 42:22.094
They have agency people with them.

42:22.095 --> 42:26.556
So when I say, "Drop to the ground,"
I will protect you.

42:26.557 --> 42:29.519
No. There is no escape, Anton.

42:29.685 --> 42:32.020
- We are in America.
- Yes.

42:32.021 --> 42:35.440
That is why we have decided
to end it here and now.

42:35.441 --> 42:38.361
Viera. You are my wife.

42:38.528 --> 42:41.028
It was an assignment.

42:45.076 --> 42:48.745
- You are too dangerous, Anton.
- Because I wanted freedom?

42:48.746 --> 42:51.164
Because you would begin
a second revolution.

42:51.165 --> 42:54.084
One death is preferable
to thousands.

42:54.085 --> 42:56.585
No!

43:01.592 --> 43:04.092
Viera, no!

43:11.435 --> 43:13.935
- You all right?
- Yes.

43:15.981 --> 43:18.481
Stay with him.

43:19.610 --> 43:21.819
What happened?

43:21.820 --> 43:24.113
She Iooked at me.

43:24.114 --> 43:27.952
My wife Iooked at me and shot.

43:28.118 --> 43:30.286
She's GRU.

43:30.287 --> 43:33.539
If you hadn't given me
the bullet-proof vest,

43:33.540 --> 43:36.040
I would be dead.

43:37.795 --> 43:40.625
Look, you just stay here. Okay?

43:44.885 --> 43:47.895
It's done. They saw me. Come on.

44:22.088 --> 44:25.018
Come on, Iet's get out of here.

44:35.310 --> 44:37.810
Freeze!

44:38.271 --> 44:42.901
- Take him, Pete.
- And I'm supposed to Iook, huh?

44:47.113 --> 44:49.753
Watch out! He's got a knife!

45:28.780 --> 45:30.280
My, my.

45:30.281 --> 45:33.075
Well, you said you wanted
your half of the money in cash.

45:33.076 --> 45:35.285
- There it is.
- Sure is.

45:35.286 --> 45:38.966
Over 200,000 thou
apiece after expenses.

45:39.749 --> 45:42.459
- Where's your half?
- Invested.

45:42.460 --> 45:45.086
See, the Phoenix Foundation
takes care of all my expenses,

45:45.087 --> 45:47.882
so anything extra is extra.

45:48.716 --> 45:51.216
What did you invest in?

45:53.137 --> 45:56.097
MacGyver, Pete, Diana,
my good friends.

45:56.098 --> 45:58.683
- Have you heard? Is it not wonderful?
- What?

45:58.684 --> 46:02.187
I am able to work with other refugees
to bring them to America.

46:02.188 --> 46:05.733
Someone has given
$200,000 for this.

46:06.150 --> 46:09.819
To give so much money,
a person must be very rich.

46:09.820 --> 46:11.863
But I cannot Iearn the name.

46:11.864 --> 46:14.324
Well, it's an anonymous donor.

46:14.325 --> 46:17.244
Yeah, some hopeless do-gooder.

46:17.411 --> 46:19.579
And the money will do good.

46:19.580 --> 46:23.208
When Viera betrayed me,
I felt I could have faith in no one.

46:23.209 --> 46:25.293
But now comes this money
from a stranger

46:25.294 --> 46:27.629
to help others gain their freedom.

46:27.630 --> 46:29.464
My faith returns again,

46:29.465 --> 46:33.635
because I know there are
good people still in this world.

46:33.636 --> 46:37.847
Yeah, well, say hello to another
hopeless do-gooder.

46:37.848 --> 46:40.683
- I'II contribute.
- Two hundred thousand dollars?

46:40.684 --> 46:43.184
Not that hopeless.

46:44.021 --> 46:46.521
Here's $20,000.

46:46.982 --> 46:49.817
- Diana.
- PIease, just take it.

46:49.818 --> 46:52.528
Before I realize what I'm doing.

46:52.529 --> 46:55.699
Thank you. You are very generous.

46:56.366 --> 46:58.826
That's something no one's ever said
to me before.

46:58.827 --> 47:01.577
Feels pretty good, doesn't it?

47:02.305 --> 47:08.901
