WEBVTT

00:03.860 --> 00:04.890
- Morning!
- Agh!

00:08.240 --> 00:11.830
What are you doing? Feels like
you're giving me a heart attack.

00:11.880 --> 00:13.990
Don't worry.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.230
- Get off.
- All right, sorry.

00:16.280 --> 00:18.880
You looked so weird, I thought
I'd better try and help.

00:20.080 --> 00:24.080
You normally only do a heart massage
if the patient is unconscious.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.310
Anyway, what you doing here at 6.47...

00:27.360 --> 00:28.550
.. and 18 seconds?

00:28.600 --> 00:30.150
You promise you won't tell anyone?

00:30.200 --> 00:33.070
I can't promise that, no. It
would be entirely unprofessional.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.790
OK, well, just not Denise then.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.990
I stayed on late last night
trying to track the files.

00:38.040 --> 00:40.030
The missing ones that
should've been digitized.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.310
I know you all blame me.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.430
No. No, no, everyone,
speaks very highly of you.

00:44.480 --> 00:48.480
Well, anyway, it got really
late, so I went to sleep.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.710
- Please don't... - Oh!
- You OK? Feeling faint again?

00:51.760 --> 00:55.760
I'm presuming you don't carry
a tooth brush, or tooth paste?

00:56.960 --> 00:59.950
I suggest you head to the
chemist and get some.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.720
Maybe pick up some deodorant
while you're there.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.270
I can't find my other shoe.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.790
Puppy's basket?

01:10.840 --> 01:12.190
- Checked.
- Under the bed?

01:12.240 --> 01:13.590
- Checked.
- Wardrobe?

01:13.640 --> 01:15.990
- Haven't checked. - Right, we'll
look for that in a minute, OK?

01:16.040 --> 01:16.970
Have some fruit.

01:17.520 --> 01:20.510
Mum, the dog pooed on my coat again!

01:20.560 --> 01:21.670
Wear your old coat.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.550
That is SO last season!

01:23.600 --> 01:25.310
Oh, what a terrible choice...

01:25.360 --> 01:29.070
Coat with poo looks nice, coat without
poo -- ooh! -- not fashionable.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.070
Get some fruit, all right?
It's nearly time to go.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.950
Ooh, that's my boss.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.470
- 'Good morning.
- Morning. So, Mrs Donnelly...

01:36.520 --> 01:39.190
- Ms Donnelly.
- Sorry, Ms Donnelly.

01:39.240 --> 01:40.550
With Brexit...

01:44.320 --> 01:45.390
Morning!

01:45.440 --> 01:47.350
Morning, Al. Fancy a coffee?

01:47.400 --> 01:49.710
How are your powers of observation, Nat?

01:49.760 --> 01:51.910
And how's the hunt for the
missing files going on?

01:51.960 --> 01:55.670
They're not on top of your head, are they?

01:55.720 --> 01:59.630
Oh, I'll go and put the kettle on.

01:59.680 --> 02:03.150
And how are you powers of observation, Al?

02:03.200 --> 02:04.910
You tell her.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.310
I don't want to be attacked
by Mimi for looking at a woman

02:07.360 --> 02:10.030
from the neck down.

02:11.760 --> 02:13.390
Fucking hell and massive bollocks.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.710
Has anyone seen Sunshine TV this morning?

02:15.760 --> 02:17.510
Or as I like to call it, Shitshine.

02:17.560 --> 02:21.270
Denise was on talking about the effects
of Brexit on the social care budget.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.230
Oh, no. That's not good for morning TV,

02:23.280 --> 02:24.630
it'll put everyone back to sleep.

02:24.680 --> 02:27.630
No, well, they asked her about
abuse at the local football club

02:27.680 --> 02:28.990
and she just froze.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.750
Oh, well, that's not like
the cold-hearted old witch.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.150
Hey, now, come on, now.
That's not very nice.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.650
I wouldn't say she was old.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.350
Nat, where's your skirt?

02:39.900 --> 02:41.400
Agh! I forgot to put it on!

02:43.600 --> 02:46.310
Oh, no, everyone's seen
my knick-knocks! Ohhh!

02:46.360 --> 02:49.110
Not really fair to
blindside Denise like that.

02:49.160 --> 02:52.230
First we heard about that case was when
that bloke came in a few weeks ago,

02:52.280 --> 02:54.670
none of the staff that he
accused are still working there,

02:54.720 --> 02:55.790
so it's a police matter.

02:55.840 --> 02:59.790
That said, let's have a look at the
Boudicca of suburbia's brain freeze

02:59.840 --> 03:02.110
before she gets here...

03:02.160 --> 03:03.950
There we are.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.190
Here we go. Oh!

03:05.240 --> 03:07.470
'A case has resurfaced in the last week,

03:07.520 --> 03:10.390
a historic abuse case at
the local football club.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.230
- Sorry?
- Er, Elm Heath Strollers.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.430
I understand you had a complaint
about this in the '80s.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.270
This isn't going to look suspicious
at all, is it, if Denise arrives?

03:18.320 --> 03:20.510
Tell you what, Mimi,
you keep a lookout, OK?

03:20.560 --> 03:22.190
If she arrives, keep her talking.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.190
Yes, Rose, I don't think that's
a very appropriate task for...

03:25.240 --> 03:26.510
Oh, there she is!

03:26.560 --> 03:29.190
The alleged victim has come
to us with information.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.350
She's coming.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.830
Go on, then, Mimi. Go on!

03:31.880 --> 03:35.030
.. historic abuse would be dealt
with by police and not by...

03:35.080 --> 03:37.350
- Now it sounds like you're
passing the buck. - Eh...

03:37.400 --> 03:39.150
Good gracious!

03:41.640 --> 03:44.870
- Ms Donnelly?
- Come on, crank it up, old girl.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.150
Oh...

03:46.200 --> 03:48.110
I think that's what we call brain freeze.

03:48.160 --> 03:52.160
Ohhhhh!

03:52.400 --> 03:54.990
Denise, we need to fight toilet tyranny.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.190
What are you going on about?

03:56.240 --> 03:59.270
The toilets, they need to be torn
down and replaced with gender-fluid,

03:59.320 --> 04:01.790
- non-binary, intersex, androgynous...
- I can't hear myself think!

04:01.840 --> 04:05.840
Just piss off.

04:06.720 --> 04:09.750
- Morning... Morning, Denise.
- Morning, Denise!

04:09.800 --> 04:11.150
Strategy meeting in five.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.390
Buckling under the pressure of
celebrity a little early, I think.

04:14.440 --> 04:16.269
You all right?

04:16.320 --> 04:17.470
Yes...

04:17.519 --> 04:18.950
I'm fine, I suppose, but...

04:19.000 --> 04:20.829
They look like lovers.

04:20.880 --> 04:22.670
Maybe you're reading too much chick-lit.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.350
Chocolate? Who said chocolate?
I haven't had any breakfast.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.190
Chick-lit. Oh, that reminds me,

04:28.240 --> 04:30.950
I've got an interview later
at the university library.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.430
So, will you cover for
me, please? Thank you.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.750
You can't work in a university library.

04:35.800 --> 04:39.110
- Why not? - Well, cos you'll
get mistaken for some creepy,

04:39.160 --> 04:41.190
mature sociology student.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.590
You'll get chucked out for
harassing the freshers.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.310
What is chick-lit?

04:46.360 --> 04:49.030
It is modern romantic
fiction, you silly arse.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.470
Well, forgive me for not being
interested in the literary fantasies

04:52.520 --> 04:54.150
of desperate, middle-aged women.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.950
So what's on your bedside table -- a
foot pump for your blow-up friend?

04:59.600 --> 05:02.950
The police stopped me, they said
the baby needs to be in a car seat.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.830
- How old is the baby?
- He's six months old.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.670
I said, "He's in a car, in a seat,

05:06.720 --> 05:09.030
"he's not rolling around
in the fucking boot!"

05:09.080 --> 05:12.550
Right, Alastair, what is
happening with the Haimes family?

05:12.600 --> 05:14.750
I saw on the log that
you got a call earlier.

05:14.800 --> 05:18.390
There's a huge amount of concern
about the four-year-old, Carter,

05:18.440 --> 05:20.350
who's on the child protection register.

05:20.400 --> 05:23.270
We all know the father is a violent
criminal who comes and goes.

05:23.320 --> 05:27.320
Nat... You put "a well-known
VIOLET criminal", Nat.

05:28.480 --> 05:32.480
There's a fear that Carter has
been left alone since yesterday.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.590
Or if Animal, the dad,
is there at the moment...

05:35.640 --> 05:37.350
Not like Amimal from the Muppets?

05:37.400 --> 05:39.590
Not... It's not like the Muppets, no.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.510
It's a totally different Animal.

05:41.560 --> 05:45.350
Don't put Muppets in the minutes, Nat.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.510
I'm going over there and I...

05:47.560 --> 05:49.670
.. I have coordinated the
visit and done all the safety

05:49.720 --> 05:52.310
and achievability stuff
with the plod, so...

05:52.360 --> 05:54.590
So professional, right
up to the last word.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.550
- Would you like me to go, Al?
- Go where?

05:56.600 --> 05:59.110
- Could think of a few places.
- With you, to the assignment.

05:59.160 --> 06:02.670
Because I've got a meeting with Zach nearby,
and I thought with my police experience...

06:02.720 --> 06:04.910
Thanks, but I've got a little
more experience than you.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.190
I can probably manage.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.910
You stick with Zach, you can
cope with that, can't you?

06:08.960 --> 06:12.630
- Lunch? - How about a candlelit
dinner for two somewhere?

06:12.680 --> 06:16.680
Tete-a-tete, then back to
Al's place for a... jigsaw.

06:17.280 --> 06:19.910
Cos we're in the same area, so...

06:19.960 --> 06:21.950
.. we could just grab a coffee, or...

06:22.000 --> 06:25.390
Dignity, Nitin. Face it,
he's just not that into you.

06:25.440 --> 06:26.750
Children, please!

06:26.800 --> 06:30.800
Rose, we'd all very much like to
hear about how you are getting on.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.470
Are you going to court later today?

06:34.520 --> 06:38.510
- No, why? - Your clothes
haven't got any food on them.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.150
It's a rare sight.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.990
Now, how are the Wilton clan progressing
since we found out a little bit more

06:44.040 --> 06:47.790
- about Jen Wilton and her new boyfriend
that she met online? - I'm sorry, I didn't...

06:47.840 --> 06:51.190
Oh, Rose, please do not tell me that
you're not up to date with your own cases.

06:51.240 --> 06:54.310
Give her a break, we all have
brain freeze from time to time.

06:54.360 --> 06:58.360
I beg your pardon, Alastair?

06:58.640 --> 07:03.040
I'm just saying, that Green Party leader, Natalie
Bennett, she had it on the radio when she...

07:03.960 --> 07:05.710
Yeah. That was funny, wasn't it,

07:05.760 --> 07:08.760
cos she goes on about global
warming and yet her brain froze.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.950
Are you talking about me
on Sunshine this morning?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.070
Sunshine? What's Sunshine?

07:16.120 --> 07:18.750
I don't know what you're talking
about, I listen to Radio 4.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.470
Anyone?

07:20.520 --> 07:22.870
Dunno.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.990
Yeah, actually, Rose came in
and told everyone about it.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.910
Hang on a minute!

07:26.960 --> 07:29.150
- Well, you did, so...
- Can I speak to you outside, please, Rose?

07:29.200 --> 07:30.830
- Martin, take over.
- Thanks.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.350
Um, OK. Er, right.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.590
Oh, I forgot, Ingrid's
calling in on Skype.

07:34.640 --> 07:36.190
Ah, yes, yes.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.710
Hello, hello, Ingrid.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.870
I just wanted to apologise for not
getting into work this morning.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.790
Limahl's been school-refusing.

07:42.840 --> 07:44.630
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

07:44.680 --> 07:48.680
Yes, sorry, yes. The Cafferty child
turned up drunk at school again today.

07:48.840 --> 07:52.190
Erm, they had a call, er, and also,
they found a bottle of vodka...

07:53.600 --> 07:57.600
.. in his bag. And he threw up
on the, on-on-on the PE teacher.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.790
Guys... Guys, can we, can we focus?

07:59.840 --> 08:01.950
- Fuck! This table's gone
to fucking... - Limahl!

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Right, OK... Ingrid, can you
just send it in an e-mail?

08:06.160 --> 08:08.270
Send it in... Send it in an e-mail.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.350
Just...

08:10.400 --> 08:11.590
Guys, we...

08:11.640 --> 08:13.550
You behave like a child.

08:13.600 --> 08:17.590
You couldn't wait to come in
here and take the piss out of me

08:17.640 --> 08:20.710
before I've even had a chance
to explain what was going on.

08:20.760 --> 08:21.990
Look, I'm sorry,

08:22.040 --> 08:26.040
but it looked like you just
couldn't explain what was going on.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.030
We've all head those head-melting moments.

08:29.080 --> 08:33.080
Oh, so you're subscribing to the
brain-freeze theory, are you?

08:33.480 --> 08:37.309
- Ish. - Well, thank you
very much for your support.

08:39.980 --> 08:40.530
All right...

08:40.580 --> 08:41.870
Children's Services.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.590
Hello? My partner and I
would like to adopt a baby...

08:44.640 --> 08:48.640
Yeah, but not an ugly one.

08:48.840 --> 08:50.710
Hello! Carter?

08:50.760 --> 08:52.510
You in there?

08:52.560 --> 08:56.560
Carter, can you open the door?

08:59.960 --> 09:03.870
Oh, God. Carter, that's dangerous!

09:03.920 --> 09:06.150
Carter, you need to put that down.

09:06.200 --> 09:09.110
You'll cut yourself.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.630
Shit.

09:10.680 --> 09:14.680
Oh, Jesus, where's Plod?

09:16.000 --> 09:18.350
Have you spoken to your wife?

09:18.400 --> 09:22.400
Er, yeah. Er, we're talking
and no longer texting in caps.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.480
And she's seeing the GP for
that thing she's got, you know?

09:29.720 --> 09:31.230
Postnatal depression.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.910
Mm-hm, yeah, that thing.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.960
Um, she's been told to rest
a bit and do a course of CDT.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.550
Craft design technology?

09:40.600 --> 09:44.350
No, not that. That's something they used
to give the thick kids to do at school.

09:44.400 --> 09:47.070
- And you're drinking?
- I've cut right down.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.670
I don't start till he's asleep

09:48.720 --> 09:50.710
and I don't have more
than a bottle a night.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.910
That's, you know, I'm
pretty rigid on that.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.070
One bottle, beer.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.390
Wine.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.430
- One bottle of wine is a lot.
- Bollocks.

09:59.480 --> 10:00.990
I can have two before it affects me.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.910
Look, you can't be drinking that
much alcohol around the baby.

10:03.960 --> 10:07.310
He's asleep. If he wakes at night, I
will have had a few, but it's fine.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.190
I don't sleep through
his crying or anything.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.470
Well, I might do. I wouldn't
know. I don't think I do.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.270
No, cos I wake up. It's fine. It's fine.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.190
On top of all this, you
seem quite depressed.

10:17.240 --> 10:20.590
Er, do you think that's got anything
to do with the fact you're in my house?

10:20.640 --> 10:23.750
Being happy is, like, it's not
the natural state anyway, is it?

10:23.800 --> 10:27.390
- And people who are happy all the time are
just fucking irritating, ain't they? - Yeah.

10:27.440 --> 10:31.230
They're the mad ones. You know,
you have good days and bad years.

10:33.000 --> 10:39.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

10:54.560 --> 10:57.430
Ugh... Your head stinks of Monster Munch.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.470
Fucking pickled onion or something!

10:59.520 --> 11:03.520
Ugh!

11:10.480 --> 11:11.950
Carter?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.430
Carter, put the knife down.

11:13.480 --> 11:16.550
I think a nanny would help if
it would give Sophie a break.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.870
Yeah, but she feels guilty about a nanny.

11:18.920 --> 11:22.310
Feels like it's giving up, and I
have problems with nannies because

11:22.360 --> 11:24.870
mine used to hit me with a carpet beater.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.070
- What? - I know, it was
horrific, I don't want to...

11:27.120 --> 11:28.830
No, what's a carpet beater?

11:28.880 --> 11:30.510
Oh, it's like a big woven thing.

11:30.560 --> 11:34.270
Like a big fly swatter
that you beat carpets with.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.630
Wow.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.790
OK, is she still alive?

11:37.840 --> 11:40.190
Because you could bring a
case against her for cruelty.

11:40.240 --> 11:41.750
Yeah, but it's complicated.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.800
She's married to my dad now.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.510
OK. Can I use your loo before I go?

11:50.560 --> 11:52.230
Yeah, if you have to. Sure.

11:52.280 --> 11:56.280
Top of the stairs. Flush twice, though.

12:10.920 --> 12:14.310
Shit.

12:14.360 --> 12:18.190
Hello.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.670
Hello.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.790
- And you need to start
paying for it. - OK. Yeah.

12:21.840 --> 12:23.670
You've got a job now and
I'm sick of your excuses.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.070
- I'm sorry, Mum. - Pay the rent,
so you need to get it to me.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.070
Yes, I realise. I owe you rent.

12:28.120 --> 12:31.270
You'll have it, I promise.

12:35.320 --> 12:38.070
Typical. Where's the
fucking social worker?

12:38.120 --> 12:41.990
Late as usual. Do we know if there's
anyone else in there apart from the

12:42.040 --> 12:43.910
- ankle-biter?
- Don't know.

12:43.960 --> 12:47.070
But I checked the address,
and Animal Haimes lives here.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.670
Shit!

12:48.720 --> 12:49.870
Be careful, then.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.280
Can't see a bloody thing.

12:55.380 --> 12:56.270
Police!

12:56.920 --> 12:58.110
Get away from me!

12:59.840 --> 13:01.710
Don't run away. No, come back...

13:01.760 --> 13:04.230
- Stop there! - No...
- Taser, Taser, Taser!

13:04.280 --> 13:05.870
- You're being Tasered!
- Ohhhh!

13:05.920 --> 13:09.390
- Ohhhh!
- Hey, hey!

13:09.440 --> 13:11.950
- What is going on, guys?
- Ohhhh!

13:12.000 --> 13:14.550
- That groaning body on the floor
is a social worker. - Ohhhh!

13:14.600 --> 13:16.830
- Well, I didn't know.
- Take your finger off the trigger.

13:16.880 --> 13:20.040
- Stop electrocuting him!
- Ohhhh!

13:20.720 --> 13:21.320
Ah!

13:34.340 --> 13:38.340
Hi. I work here. Can I help you?

13:38.780 --> 13:42.780
Got an informal interview
with Claudia, uh...

13:46.020 --> 13:49.530
- .. a stupid name.
- Funnel? - Yeah, that's it!

13:49.580 --> 13:53.290
Hi, I'm Claudia Funnel.

13:53.340 --> 13:57.340
- Bad start.
- I think you already started badly.

13:58.380 --> 14:01.650
Let me help you out. I can
see you're upset about this.

14:01.700 --> 14:05.050
Honestly, I couldn't, really. In
a weird way, it's patronising,

14:05.100 --> 14:07.330
even though it would be
right, I think, because

14:07.380 --> 14:09.530
as a white male you are
the ultimate oppressor.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.250
It feels unprofessional,

14:11.300 --> 14:13.850
- despite me not having an
actual job here. - Mimi...

14:13.900 --> 14:17.900
.. my kids aren't around at the
moment, and I miss helping them out.

14:18.300 --> 14:22.300
So, please, let me do
this for you just the once.

14:24.460 --> 14:27.290
Well, OK, thanks so much, Martin.

14:27.340 --> 14:31.210
- How much?
- £350 a month.

14:31.260 --> 14:34.850
Crikey. I'm out of touch.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.930
OK, well, uh, there's...
there's £100. I'll...

14:37.980 --> 14:41.980
I'll give you the rest first
thing tomorrow morning.

14:48.780 --> 14:51.650
- All right, Nat? - For
you. - What do you mean?

14:51.700 --> 14:54.170
Well, you seemed to be crying
a lot and now you're not.

14:54.220 --> 14:56.530
I was crying because of
the continuing ascendancy

14:56.580 --> 14:59.650
of the patriarchy being
an anathema to my life.

14:59.700 --> 15:03.700
Yeah, that really pisses me off too.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.730
Well, I'm glad the
interview was shit, because

15:07.780 --> 15:10.610
- I don't want you to leave!
- Oh, I'm just sick of all the grimness.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.250
I mean, look at today! I do my
job. All the thanks I get is to be

15:13.300 --> 15:16.250
electrocuted and now Animal
Hames is going to be after me

15:16.300 --> 15:18.450
for taking his kid into care.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.450
Why do you look like such
a twat today, anyway?

15:21.500 --> 15:25.500
- Define "twat".
- Sort of drag-queen dinner-lady look.

15:25.740 --> 15:29.010
Yeah, huh! '70s footballer!

15:29.060 --> 15:31.170
Oh, my God. You've got a date!

15:32.220 --> 15:36.220
- Who is it? Poor bastard!
- Well... Denise...

15:36.820 --> 15:38.890
Denise? What's going on?

15:38.940 --> 15:42.810
- No, Denise has got a
brother, and it's him. - Oh.

15:42.860 --> 15:46.850
Oh, that's weird. What's he
like, then? Denise in slacks?

15:46.900 --> 15:49.870
Sort of paramilitary wing of
the Citizens Advice Bureau?

15:49.920 --> 15:50.920
Hang on a minute.

15:54.700 --> 15:58.700
- Hello, Daga. - Your mum just...
- She did what? Oh, God...

15:59.300 --> 16:01.690
All right, I'll be there
as soon I can. OK, bye.

16:01.740 --> 16:04.050
Thank you. Bye.

16:04.100 --> 16:07.530
My mum's hit the occupational
therapist with a painting.

16:07.580 --> 16:10.410
Oh, dear. I hope they're
not going to chuck her out.

16:10.460 --> 16:14.370
Well, that's what I'm worried about.
I mean, I can't have her back.

16:14.420 --> 16:16.650
You, uh, you going out tonight?

16:16.700 --> 16:19.730
I doubt it. I feel like
I've been hit by a truck!

16:19.780 --> 16:21.690
Oh!

16:21.740 --> 16:25.740
Sorry, Al.

16:26.060 --> 16:27.330
Are you all right?

16:31.980 --> 16:33.530
All right, OK.

16:33.580 --> 16:36.610
So how's things?

16:36.660 --> 16:40.250
Fine all the days people don't tell
me to go back to Poland or Estonia

16:40.300 --> 16:44.290
- or Russia. Or Esperanto the other day.
- Sorry to hear that.

16:44.340 --> 16:47.610
I wish the Brexiteers would
exit to the four corners.

16:47.660 --> 16:50.250
So how's my mum been,
apart from the incident?

16:50.300 --> 16:54.300
Well, she's been quite
destructive and angry.

16:54.460 --> 16:56.970
That's why she's having her
meals in her room at the moment.

16:57.020 --> 16:59.450
She starts a lot of arguments otherwise.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.470
What?!

17:01.020 --> 17:03.970
Oh, what do you want now? Oh...

17:04.020 --> 17:07.010
Hello, Mum. How are you?

17:07.060 --> 17:10.970
- Nice dinner?
- Why don't you try some?

17:12.220 --> 17:14.329
- What did you do that for?
- Felt like it.

17:14.380 --> 17:17.450
- Shit, I'm supposed to be going out later.
- Fuck off, then!

17:17.500 --> 17:19.490
Why don't you fuck off yourself?!

17:19.540 --> 17:23.540
- Don't! - Oh, I'm sorry. I really
shouldn't talk to my mum like that.

17:25.099 --> 17:29.100
Well, we all want to.

17:29.180 --> 17:32.570
School policy says no smacking,
so I gave Oliver a Chinese burn!

17:32.620 --> 17:35.610
- Is that all right?
- Well, I would have some concerns about that,

17:35.660 --> 17:38.410
- actually, yes, sir. - Oh, what,
because I said Chinese? - Look, Mason,

17:38.460 --> 17:40.250
there's something I need to say to you.

17:40.300 --> 17:43.610
Prepare for bollocking,
prepare for bollocking.

17:43.660 --> 17:46.210
- Thanks.
- Pardon?

17:46.260 --> 17:49.290
- Thanks.
- Yes, uh, well...

17:49.340 --> 17:53.130
- Yeah, so fancy you pitching
up in the nick of time. - Mmm.

17:53.180 --> 17:55.250
Like Batman.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.770
Anyway, I owe you one.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.370
Well, actually, Al...

18:01.420 --> 18:04.290
Are you... busy tonight?

18:04.340 --> 18:07.090
- Oh, that was quick. You're asking me out?
- Yeah, very funny.

18:07.140 --> 18:10.090
I mean, I am actually meeting
someone, but, I mean, I've met her

18:10.140 --> 18:12.770
a couple of times, but her sister
is in town, staying with her,

18:12.820 --> 18:16.170
- so I thought, maybe...
- That I'd like to go on a blind date?

18:16.220 --> 18:18.370
Well, you know.

18:18.420 --> 18:21.690
- Actually, why not? I could
do with a drink. - Yeah? Great.

18:21.740 --> 18:24.130
Animal Hames is on the
warpath, so I don't want to go

18:24.180 --> 18:26.890
- on my own, anyway.
- Oh, of course you don't.

18:26.940 --> 18:30.570
- Where are you going?
- Oh, just the usual spot.

18:30.620 --> 18:32.210
Let's go to Scenarios.

18:32.260 --> 18:34.690
- Scenarios, the worst place on earth.
- Scenarios is great!

18:34.740 --> 18:36.890
It's the worst-case scenario,
is what that place is.

18:36.940 --> 18:39.130
Oh, come on, you had such a
good time there last time.

18:39.180 --> 18:43.180
Yes, I got beaten up.

18:54.340 --> 18:58.340
Oh, there she is. I didn't see you
come in. Head for the toilet, eh?

19:00.060 --> 19:02.690
- Do you live in there?
- I've been in there awhile.

19:02.740 --> 19:06.740
- I, um, I had a slight issue.
- Oh, dicky tummy?

19:06.940 --> 19:09.850
- Oh, little bit of up-squirt.
- Oh, I'm not that clever.

19:12.740 --> 19:15.410
No, the truth is that I went
to visit my mum, and she chucked

19:15.460 --> 19:19.090
- her dinner at me. - Ah, well,
good shot. - Well, easy target.

19:19.140 --> 19:22.130
I mean, it was disgusting. It
looked like gristly stew thing,

19:22.180 --> 19:25.250
not even nice enough to lick
off, so, anyway, horrible.

19:25.300 --> 19:27.130
What can I get you to drink?

19:27.180 --> 19:30.410
Um, vodka and lime, please.
Can you make it a large one?

19:30.460 --> 19:34.460
- OK. A large vodka and lime, please.
- Yes, sir.

19:34.620 --> 19:38.290
Oh, shit, fuck!

19:38.340 --> 19:41.370
- Hiya. - Hi, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm good, thank you.

19:41.420 --> 19:45.420
- Oh, this is my sister, Lauren.
- This is Al, a colleague from work.

19:46.900 --> 19:50.690
- So, this is a social worker uniform, is it?
- Well, it's slightly dictated

19:50.740 --> 19:52.650
by our economic bracket.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.410
- By what?
- How much money we get paid.

19:55.460 --> 19:58.130
- Oh, right. Is it not a lot?
- Also it's practicality.

19:58.180 --> 20:01.730
Yeah. Do you not, like, need to be,
like, out saving kids or something?

20:01.780 --> 20:03.850
- We've done that today, haven't we?
- We have.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.530
OK, that's enough kids saved, is it?

20:05.580 --> 20:07.250
I don't know what constitutes enough.

20:07.300 --> 20:10.090
- I've saved one today. - That's really
cool, that's really great! - Yeah.

20:10.140 --> 20:12.450
You know that everyone thinks
social workers are useless.

20:12.500 --> 20:16.130
Just ignore her. She thinks
that Joseph Stalin is a good man.

20:16.180 --> 20:19.130
- He did some good things for the trains.
- I really disagree.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.730
He was good. OK, I think
I've things to do.

20:21.780 --> 20:24.970
- Shame. - This is all I
need after a shit day.

20:25.020 --> 20:28.810
- I don't know. She's gorgeous, though.
- Is that your only criteria?

20:28.860 --> 20:32.860
No, they have to be clean as well.

20:33.980 --> 20:36.970
- You expecting an earthquake?
- I'm just trying to hide from

20:37.020 --> 20:39.970
- two of my colleagues. They'll take the piss.
- Why, cos you're on a date

20:40.020 --> 20:44.020
- with such a minger? - I believe
that word passed out of common parlance

20:44.820 --> 20:46.730
probably around about the 18th century.

20:46.780 --> 20:49.810
It's a pity. I've only
just got my head round it.

20:49.860 --> 20:53.530
- So, you've been married before, you minger?
- Well, I'm a very recently

20:53.580 --> 20:57.580
divorced gentleman with an
invisible "slap me down" tattoo

20:57.940 --> 21:01.940
- written across my forehead.
- You're just what I'm looking for. Cheers.

21:02.140 --> 21:04.010
- Have I passed the test?
- You have.

21:04.060 --> 21:06.090
There's a chubby woman
on the floor over there.

21:06.140 --> 21:08.810
I don't know if she's pissed
or not. She's just on the floor.

21:08.860 --> 21:12.250
I mean, oh... I hate fat people!
Waddling into A&E, being like,

21:12.300 --> 21:15.010
"Oh, my joints hurt!" And
they've eaten like twice

21:15.060 --> 21:17.330
their body weight in,
like, Haribo for breakfast.

21:17.380 --> 21:20.050
I don't even think the NHS should
treat them. You know, I think

21:20.100 --> 21:23.490
- they brought it on themselves.
- They're disgusting? - Thank you. - Right.

21:23.540 --> 21:26.250
Can we go? I just can't face them tonight.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.290
They're such massive piss-takers!

21:28.340 --> 21:29.450
I just don't want to

21:29.500 --> 21:33.500
spend the night parrying the
blows from my work colleagues!

21:33.780 --> 21:36.410
- You need to stop talking about
fat people all the time. - Why?

21:36.460 --> 21:39.890
You all right, Nitin? You seem to
have metamorphosed into Katie Hopkins.

21:39.940 --> 21:42.410
Uh, don't ever tell Rose I
said something like that.

21:42.460 --> 21:45.970
- She'll kill me. - I'll kill you for
bringing me on a date with a UKIP pin-up.

21:46.020 --> 21:47.650
I'm going out for a fag.

21:47.700 --> 21:48.890
I mean, Al's the worst.

21:48.940 --> 21:51.810
He's going to take the piss
out of me for ever over this.

21:51.860 --> 21:55.860
- Hey, Rose. - Bugger.
- Dennis, I presume?

21:56.340 --> 21:59.850
Nice to meet you.

21:59.900 --> 22:03.570
Oh, shit. Animal Hames has just
spotted you. Run, run, run!

22:03.620 --> 22:06.690
Very funny. Rose is pretending
there's a gangster behind me

22:06.740 --> 22:09.650
because she's determined not
to let me meet you properly.

22:09.700 --> 22:13.700
- Oh! - You fucking piece of shit!
I'll kill you! Where's Carter?!

22:18.940 --> 22:22.810
Thanks, buddy! You just
knocked out Animal Hames.

22:22.860 --> 22:25.410
I should introduce you to my ex-husband.

22:25.460 --> 22:27.610
We should probably go
before he comes round.

22:27.660 --> 22:30.210
- If he does, I'll just hit him again.
- You know, I didn't even hit him

22:30.260 --> 22:33.410
and I'm thinking about
living under an assumed name.

22:33.460 --> 22:35.810
I've got to go. There's a family crisis.

22:35.860 --> 22:39.090
- Denise? - Yeah, she's having trouble
with a very persistent stalker.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.410
Oh, so you're going to
go and help sort him out?

22:41.460 --> 22:45.290
- Yeah. Her. Got to rush. See ya!
- What was that?

22:45.340 --> 22:49.170
- Did he just say "her"?
- I heard "her". Should we go

22:49.220 --> 22:51.770
and get a vodka and lime at
another establishment, chubby?

22:51.820 --> 22:54.250
- Beg your pardon?
- I'll tell you about it on the way.

22:54.300 --> 22:58.090
- What about your date?
- I'll pass. She's marginally to the right

22:58.140 --> 22:59.370
- of the Hitler Youth.
- Mm.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.930
How can you hate social
workers? He looks really nice!

23:01.980 --> 23:04.130
No, look at him! Look,
he's wearing anorak!

23:04.180 --> 23:08.180

23:09.900 --> 23:13.900

23:17.100 --> 23:21.100
