12:35.631 --> 12:38.070
all the booze you can skim.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.140
Sounds pretty nice,

12:41.141 --> 12:43.179
doesn't it?

12:43.190 --> 12:45.139
Maybe.

12:46.149 --> 12:48.179
I'll take that as a yes.

12:50.110 --> 12:51.190
Ready!

12:57.289 --> 12:59.110
Ya-ya-ya-ya-yeow!

13:30.070 --> 13:31.289
Shit.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.190
I thought you were dead.

13:40.159 --> 13:42.084
Look, I'd like to apologize

13:42.085 --> 13:44.009
for shooting you

13:44.019 --> 13:45.519
and if it means anything I

13:45.520 --> 13:47.019
aimed for your vest, alright?

13:47.029 --> 13:48.139
So thanks?

13:51.059 --> 13:52.085
You got a hard head,

13:52.086 --> 13:53.110
I'll give you that.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.210
You have no idea.

13:54.220 --> 13:56.039
No, I don't, actually.

13:56.049 --> 13:57.549
Like why did you shoot me

13:57.550 --> 13:59.049
to get into this hell hole,

13:59.059 --> 14:01.000
- then kill a bus driver
- to escape?

14:01.009 --> 14:02.009
No, I didn't kill anyone.

14:02.019 --> 14:03.519
Then end up breaking in here,

14:03.520 --> 14:05.019
anyway.

14:07.159 --> 14:10.070
To find your wife, right?

14:10.080 --> 14:12.039
That Jennifer lady.

14:15.009 --> 14:17.029
Please.

14:17.039 --> 14:19.159
- Let's leave her out of this,
- alright?

14:19.169 --> 14:21.000
- Oh, now you're asking
- for favours?

14:21.009 --> 14:22.120
You are something else.

14:22.129 --> 14:27.120
I'm asking you to please forget

14:27.129 --> 14:29.080
- you know anything
- about her, alright?

14:29.090 --> 14:30.600
Well, if I don't I'll probably

14:30.601 --> 14:32.110
end up dead, too.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.840
- And now what happened
- to my friend, Jolene?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.179
- I'm supposed to keep you two
- separated till he gets back.

14:38.190 --> 14:40.149
Why? Who's "he"?

14:42.090 --> 14:45.149
Oh, you'll find out soon enough.

15:17.110 --> 15:18.100
Don't talk to me.

15:18.110 --> 15:19.179
Okay.

15:19.190 --> 15:21.190
This is just my job.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.230
- They'll kill us too if they
- find out why you're here.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.070
They're not gonna kill me.

15:25.080 --> 15:28.090
I'll figure a way out of this.

15:28.100 --> 15:29.600
You have no idea what I've done

15:29.601 --> 15:31.100
to survive here.

15:31.110 --> 15:33.600
I have done everything right

15:33.601 --> 15:36.090
and now you-

15:36.100 --> 15:38.200
- He risked everything to come
- here and save you.

15:38.210 --> 15:40.159
I told you to shut your mouth.

15:44.139 --> 15:46.084
And I know what he did to you

15:46.085 --> 15:48.029
and your children.

15:48.039 --> 15:49.240
Don't you dare.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.129
- I hope they're torturing
- him in there.

15:51.139 --> 15:52.159
I'd kill him myself

15:52.160 --> 15:53.179
if I could.

15:53.190 --> 15:54.620
What he did, it wasn't

15:54.621 --> 15:56.049
his fault.

15:56.059 --> 15:57.130
You don't know what

15:57.131 --> 15:58.200
you're talking about.

15:58.210 --> 16:00.190
You have no idea.

16:10.159 --> 16:12.169
It's like a fortress.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.039
- It used to be
- some kind of bank

16:14.049 --> 16:15.200
- Or money counting place,
- I think.

16:15.210 --> 16:17.019
Money?

16:17.029 --> 16:18.169
That's useful.

16:18.179 --> 16:19.609
It's not the money we're after,

16:19.610 --> 16:21.039
it's the food.

16:21.049 --> 16:22.620
There's a cafeteria or

16:22.621 --> 16:24.190
restaurant on the top floor.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.620
We can see it from beside

16:25.621 --> 16:27.039
the building.

16:27.049 --> 16:29.019
- I don't think anyone's been able
- to get up there yet

16:29.029 --> 16:30.100
So it should be fully stocked.

16:30.110 --> 16:32.210
- Chad found a door he thinks
- he can get through months ago.

16:32.220 --> 16:37.059
So why didn't you break in then

16:37.070 --> 16:39.149
Things went sideways.

16:39.159 --> 16:40.620
I barely got my lookout

16:40.621 --> 16:42.080
out of there alive.

16:44.259 --> 16:45.730
I can't imagine being a kid

16:45.731 --> 16:47.200
through all this.

16:54.169 --> 16:56.039
Hey.

16:59.179 --> 17:01.070
I'll be back before you know it.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.220
That's what Mike said.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.108
And everyone else.

17:04.118 --> 17:06.118
- Well, I'm not everyone else,
- am I?

17:06.130 --> 17:08.645
And you have Monica

17:08.646 --> 17:11.160
to take care of you.

17:11.170 --> 17:13.230
You never left me before.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.150
I always used to go with you.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.170
Well, look how that turned out.

17:17.180 --> 17:18.720
I have people to help me

17:18.721 --> 17:20.259
take care of you now.

17:20.269 --> 17:23.079
I just want you to be safe.

17:23.089 --> 17:24.098
You're ditching me,

17:24.099 --> 17:25.108
aren't you?

17:25.118 --> 17:27.130
No.

17:27.140 --> 17:28.700
Tabby, I would never

17:28.701 --> 17:30.259
ditch you.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.099
It was Mike's, right?

17:40.269 --> 17:41.674
I would never leave

17:41.675 --> 17:43.079
without that.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.250
So you know

17:45.251 --> 17:46.269
I'll be back.

17:46.279 --> 17:48.180
Okay?

17:52.150 --> 17:53.140
Ready?

17:53.150 --> 17:54.160
All set.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.089
- We cut back towards my
- old garage and keep going.

17:56.099 --> 17:57.240
We'll be back before dark.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.190
I'll leave the light on.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.140
If I can get the genny working.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.170
I am gonna go check on the fuel

18:11.171 --> 18:13.089
brewing in the kitchen.

18:13.099 --> 18:14.089
Okay.

18:14.099 --> 18:15.109
Awesome.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.089
Hold still.

18:34.099 --> 18:35.190
- What's going on?
- What're you doing?

18:35.200 --> 18:37.069
You don't wanna know.

18:37.079 --> 18:38.259
The Warden is coming.

18:38.269 --> 18:40.210
- Please, just keep my wife
- out of this-

18:40.220 --> 18:42.099
I'm not promising shit.

18:42.109 --> 18:44.150
- You have no idea what this guy
- is capable of.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.150
- Oh, you go away
- for a couple days,

18:46.160 --> 18:47.259
All hell breaks loose.

18:47.269 --> 18:49.190
Morning, Warden.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.200
Is that what it is?

18:51.210 --> 18:52.269
What was your name again?

18:52.279 --> 18:54.089
Jeremy.

18:54.099 --> 18:56.000
Jeremy.

18:56.230 --> 18:58.150
- Jeremy, this guy shot you
- once, right?

18:58.160 --> 18:59.215
Is that what the boys

18:59.216 --> 19:00.269
are telling me?

19:00.279 --> 19:02.119
Yes, sir.

19:02.130 --> 19:03.269
- Do you have any idea
- why he's here?

19:03.279 --> 19:04.289
No, sir.

19:08.210 --> 19:10.009
What about you?

19:10.019 --> 19:11.110
You want to fill me in

19:11.111 --> 19:12.200
as to why you

19:12.210 --> 19:14.200
and well, whatever her name is

19:14.201 --> 19:16.190
broke into a prison?

19:19.089 --> 19:20.119
No?

19:20.130 --> 19:21.099
Oh, good.

19:21.109 --> 19:22.259
I love it when they're quiet.

19:22.269 --> 19:24.109
- Mysteries are like
- my favourite thing.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.230
He knows.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.150
But let me get this straight.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.675
You uh, you shot a cop

19:28.676 --> 19:30.190
to get in here,

19:30.200 --> 19:33.160
escaped on the way, and then uh,

19:33.161 --> 19:36.119
broke back in.

19:36.130 --> 19:37.210
Wow.

19:37.220 --> 19:39.140
Must be a hell of a story.

19:39.150 --> 19:41.210
Hey Jer?

19:41.220 --> 19:42.620
You wouldn't happen to have

19:42.621 --> 19:44.019
a light, would you?

19:50.289 --> 19:52.240
- You don't mind,
- do you?

19:52.250 --> 19:54.140
- Some assholes hate
- the smell of them,

19:54.150 --> 19:55.580
But you're not one of those

19:55.581 --> 19:57.009
assholes, are you?

19:58.289 --> 20:00.189
God, you've got

20:00.190 --> 20:02.089
some beautiful eyes.

20:02.099 --> 20:03.145
Did anyone ever

20:03.146 --> 20:04.190
tell you that?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.279
- No, we should probably go slow,
- though.

20:09.289 --> 20:11.190
No rush, right?

20:11.200 --> 20:13.730
Plenty of time to, uh,

20:13.731 --> 20:16.259
pry that story out.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.130
Ahhhhh!!!!

20:23.140 --> 20:24.230
Ohh-wee!

20:24.240 --> 20:25.765
I love the sound of ribs

20:25.766 --> 20:27.289
cracking, it's like-

20:28.000 --> 20:29.240
it's like bubble wrap to me.

20:29.250 --> 20:30.240
You hear that?

20:30.250 --> 20:33.210
Ahhhhhh!!!!!

20:38.160 --> 20:40.000
You got a problem, Jer?

20:40.009 --> 20:41.130
I'm good.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.230
You don't look good.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.289
Better than him but...

20:45.000 --> 20:46.190
- Oh, no don't tell me you don't
- have the stomach

20:46.200 --> 20:48.230
For this sort of thing.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.250
- I don't have the stomach
- for the liver

20:49.259 --> 20:51.160
- They dished out
- at breakfast.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.119
- You're gonna lose your lunch,
- is that it?

20:53.130 --> 20:54.259
- It's the other end that's
- the problem.

20:54.269 --> 20:56.019
Woo!

20:57.259 --> 20:59.210
I like him.

20:59.220 --> 21:02.160
I like you, this guy's a riot.

21:02.170 --> 21:04.180
Don't worry, Jer.

21:04.190 --> 21:06.200
I know how to get him to talk.

21:09.009 --> 21:11.160
Let's get some fresh air.

21:23.269 --> 21:25.210
What're you looking at?

21:25.220 --> 21:26.715
Get back to work

21:26.716 --> 21:28.210
before I ship you out east.

21:28.220 --> 21:30.039
Geez.

21:37.250 --> 21:38.250
Morning.

21:39.059 --> 21:40.110
I trust you've been having

21:40.111 --> 21:41.160
a nice day so far,

21:41.170 --> 21:43.090
a lot of time to think

21:43.091 --> 21:45.009
things over.

21:45.019 --> 21:46.514
You must be the boss

21:46.515 --> 21:48.009
around here.

21:48.019 --> 21:49.059
Sharp as a tack.

21:49.069 --> 21:50.200
I like that in a woman.

21:50.210 --> 21:52.059
- You must like a lot
- of women then.

21:54.259 --> 21:55.269
Jeremy.

21:55.279 --> 21:57.019
You put him right here.

21:57.029 --> 21:58.240
That would be wonderful.

22:01.160 --> 22:02.590
Did you know this guy

22:02.591 --> 22:04.019
before he shot the cop?

22:04.029 --> 22:05.210
- Something going on
- between you two?

22:05.220 --> 22:07.220
Not my type.

22:07.230 --> 22:09.019
Hmm.

22:09.029 --> 22:12.180
What about you, Jer?

22:12.190 --> 22:13.220
Do you know her?

22:13.230 --> 22:14.190
No.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.140
I don't know either of them.

22:17.150 --> 22:19.059
Really?

22:19.069 --> 22:20.115
'Cause I'm kinda thinking

22:20.116 --> 22:21.160
we've got a bit of

22:21.170 --> 22:22.200
a love triangle situation

22:22.201 --> 22:23.230
going on here.

22:23.240 --> 22:27.210
Correct me if I'm wrong.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.690
You stole her from him

22:28.691 --> 22:30.160
and you just lost your shit,

22:30.170 --> 22:31.230
didn't you?

22:31.240 --> 22:33.250
Shot him, followed him, then

22:33.251 --> 22:35.259
you came here for both of them?

22:35.269 --> 22:37.160
Not even close.

22:37.170 --> 22:38.170
Oh.

22:38.180 --> 22:39.665
Well then, please,

22:39.666 --> 22:41.150
do enlighten me.

22:46.289 --> 22:47.664
You wouldn't believe me

22:47.665 --> 22:49.039
if I did.

22:49.049 --> 22:51.549
Well I already told your friend

22:51.550 --> 22:54.049
over there I love mysteries.

22:54.059 --> 22:55.169
But there is a limit,

22:55.170 --> 22:56.279
isn't there?

22:56.289 --> 22:58.664
I mean, they can just get

22:58.665 --> 23:01.039
so goddamn... annoying.

23:06.059 --> 23:08.220
You know what?

23:08.230 --> 23:10.240
I'm tired of all this.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.240
Shoot her, too.

23:11.250 --> 23:12.240
- No, no, no, no,
- no, no.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.240
Don't, please.

23:13.250 --> 23:14.230
I have to.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.240
No, you don't wanna do this.

23:15.250 --> 23:16.240
You need me!

23:16.250 --> 23:17.259
Denver sent us!

23:20.289 --> 23:23.079
Denver?

23:23.089 --> 23:24.230
As in Blak Tek?

23:24.240 --> 23:25.289
Yeah.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.269
Why?

23:31.279 --> 23:33.250
What for?

23:33.259 --> 23:37.049
To spy on you.

23:37.059 --> 23:38.170
They promised us if-

23:38.180 --> 23:39.715
if we reported on you

23:39.716 --> 23:41.250
we'd get a lighter sentence.

23:41.259 --> 23:43.210
- Why should I believe
- this story?

23:43.220 --> 23:44.269
Because it's true.

23:44.279 --> 23:45.765
They told me they thought

23:45.766 --> 23:47.250
you were skimming off the top,

23:47.259 --> 23:49.674
trading supplies,

23:49.675 --> 23:52.089
prisoners, too.

23:52.099 --> 23:55.069
So, are ya?

23:57.220 --> 24:00.210
Ahhh!!!

24:06.269 --> 24:08.250
Well, well, well.

24:08.259 --> 24:10.059
More surprises.

24:12.079 --> 24:14.009
You know what, Jeremy?

24:14.019 --> 24:15.615
Bring her to my office,

24:15.616 --> 24:17.210
chain him up.

24:17.220 --> 24:18.210
I want to keep them both

24:18.220 --> 24:19.235
until I figure out

24:19.236 --> 24:20.250
what the hell's going on.

24:20.259 --> 24:22.654
First, I must use

24:22.655 --> 24:25.049
the little girl's room.

24:31.029 --> 24:33.039
He's a psycho.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.259
- This lock kit was just sitting
- there in the garage.

25:33.269 --> 25:35.160
I practised but...

25:40.079 --> 25:41.615
They make that look a lot

25:41.616 --> 25:43.150
easier on TV, huh?

25:43.160 --> 25:45.119
God, I miss TV.

25:45.130 --> 25:46.250
- Keep a look, there's always
- a ton of them

25:46.259 --> 25:48.119
Roaming around out here.

25:48.130 --> 25:51.000
We've gotta get in and out.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.250
Oh, crap!

25:52.259 --> 25:55.059
Let me try.

25:55.069 --> 25:56.200
Be my guest.

26:02.160 --> 26:03.150
Chad!

26:03.160 --> 26:04.119
Chad!

26:04.130 --> 26:05.059
Have you seen Tabby?

26:05.069 --> 26:06.160
I think she took off after you!

26:06.170 --> 26:07.160
What?

26:07.170 --> 26:08.230
Shit.

26:09.170 --> 26:10.170
Hey!

26:10.180 --> 26:11.220
Watch out!

26:27.230 --> 26:29.109
Take his head!

26:35.180 --> 26:36.230
Shit.

27:23.190 --> 27:24.190
Chad!

27:25.109 --> 27:26.150
Tabby!

27:26.160 --> 27:27.240
Tabby, no!

27:31.250 --> 27:33.289
Oh, Tabby, oh god.

27:53.220 --> 27:54.240
No!

27:58.210 --> 27:59.240
No!

27:59.250 --> 28:00.230
Oh shit!

28:00.240 --> 28:01.240
Shit!

28:01.250 --> 28:03.180
Oh my god, Jack!

28:04.009 --> 28:05.170
Oh.

28:06.250 --> 28:07.695
I can't become

28:07.696 --> 28:09.140
one of those monsters.

28:09.150 --> 28:10.230
No.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.289
I need you to kill me.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.029
No.

28:13.039 --> 28:16.109
No, no, I can't.

28:16.119 --> 28:17.109
Hurry.

28:17.119 --> 28:18.099
There's another way.

28:18.109 --> 28:19.160
There's another way, Jack.

28:19.170 --> 28:21.109
Listen to me.

28:21.119 --> 28:22.109
No, Jack, listen to me.

28:22.119 --> 28:23.049
Fine!

28:23.059 --> 28:24.200
- -I'll do it myself!
- -Oh, my god!

28:24.210 --> 28:25.220
What?

28:25.230 --> 28:27.259
No!!!

28:27.269 --> 28:30.259
Jack, what did you do?

28:30.269 --> 28:32.009
Shit.

28:32.019 --> 28:33.210
Oh, my god!

28:35.049 --> 28:37.170
Why?

28:37.180 --> 28:39.240
Why Jack?

28:41.269 --> 28:43.150
Oh, my god!

28:50.279 --> 28:52.160
Jack!

30:07.190 --> 30:10.019
We have to be sure.

30:10.029 --> 30:12.140
It's what she'd want.

30:39.269 --> 30:40.764
How many bodies did you throw

30:40.765 --> 30:42.259
in the dumpster?

30:42.269 --> 30:44.039
Four.

30:44.049 --> 30:45.160
Including Jack?

30:45.170 --> 30:46.279
Yeah.

30:46.289 --> 30:47.289
Why?

31:00.099 --> 31:01.650
One of the daywalkers

31:01.651 --> 31:03.200
is still alive.

31:27.029 --> 31:30.000
Please help me.

31:30.009 --> 31:31.240
What the...?

31:38.069 --> 31:39.210
Oh, shit!

31:39.220 --> 31:41.210
What is that?

31:46.009 --> 31:47.190
I'll do it.

31:49.230 --> 31:51.009
Monica, wait.

31:51.019 --> 31:52.269
Jesus Christ.

31:54.119 --> 31:55.210
Wait.

31:55.220 --> 31:57.049
What're you doing?

31:57.059 --> 32:00.279
Please...

32:00.289 --> 32:02.099
Help...

32:02.109 --> 32:03.289
Oh my god.

32:09.119 --> 32:11.230
Help me.

32:11.240 --> 32:13.250
Jack.

32:34.279 --> 32:36.140
I told you not to talk.

32:36.150 --> 32:37.600
He's just making you wait

32:37.601 --> 32:39.049
so it's worse.

32:39.059 --> 32:41.049
- You don't seem to like
- your new job.

32:45.049 --> 32:47.049
Your friend totally screwed me.

32:47.059 --> 32:48.150
I had it good in Denver.

32:48.160 --> 32:51.039
I had a job, I was safe.

32:51.049 --> 32:53.130
- But they told me I should have
- drew my weapon first.

32:53.140 --> 32:55.279
Hmm.

32:55.289 --> 32:57.250
Now the Warden's suspicious

32:57.251 --> 32:59.210
you know something.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.615
Phil shot you then you're the

33:00.616 --> 33:02.009
one that catches us sneaking in?

33:02.019 --> 33:03.150
I told you to shut up.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.720
- And you couldn't shoot me
- out there.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.049
He saw that, too.

33:06.059 --> 33:08.039
- If he finds out that I've been
- talking to you, I'm dead.

33:08.049 --> 33:09.230
You're dead anyway.

33:09.240 --> 33:11.180
It doesn't matter what's true.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.100
He suspects you,

33:13.101 --> 33:15.009
you're a dead man walking.

33:15.019 --> 33:16.524
You need to get out of here

33:16.525 --> 33:18.029
as much as we do.

33:21.009 --> 33:22.289
Blak Tek didn't send you.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.289
That's bullshit, right?

33:26.160 --> 33:28.000
Impossible to know.

33:28.009 --> 33:29.210
That's the beauty of it.

33:29.220 --> 33:31.170
- You know, you're smart,
- but you don't know everything.

33:31.180 --> 33:32.210
Yeah?

33:32.220 --> 33:34.049
Like what?

33:37.029 --> 33:38.034
There was a rumour

33:38.035 --> 33:39.039
Denver fell.

33:41.069 --> 33:42.190
What do you mean, fell?

33:42.200 --> 33:44.230
That everyone is dead and gone.

33:47.279 --> 33:49.150
Sarah.

33:50.150 --> 33:51.160
No one's told the Warden.

33:51.170 --> 33:53.019
We don't know if it's true.

33:53.029 --> 33:54.534
Right, and he's the type of

33:54.535 --> 33:56.039
person who shoots the messenger

33:56.049 --> 33:57.140
Right.

33:58.180 --> 34:00.289
I won't say anything.

34:02.259 --> 34:03.644
I'm sorry if he makes me

34:03.645 --> 34:05.029
kill you.

34:05.039 --> 34:06.049
I don't have a choice.

34:06.059 --> 34:08.010
Honey, I'm home!

34:09.179 --> 34:10.239
Sorry, I'm late.

34:10.250 --> 34:12.719
I had to go down to the mines,

34:12.721 --> 34:15.190
rattle a couple cages.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.018
You want a drink?

34:19.030 --> 34:20.018
Sure.

34:20.030 --> 34:21.018
Whatever's going.

34:21.030 --> 34:22.199
Okay.

34:22.210 --> 34:24.030
Jer, get Denver on the radio.

34:24.039 --> 34:25.230
- Tell them I want to speak
- to Maddox.

34:25.239 --> 34:27.018
Yes, sir.

34:38.190 --> 34:39.605
So tell me, your little

34:39.606 --> 34:41.018
friend outside,

34:41.030 --> 34:42.545
is he some sort of

34:42.545 --> 34:44.059
Blak Tek experiment?

34:44.070 --> 34:45.625
Yeah, that's what

34:45.626 --> 34:47.179
they told me.

34:47.190 --> 34:49.030
- Who's your source
- over there, anyway?

34:49.039 --> 34:50.059
Some woman.

34:50.070 --> 34:51.130
Said her name was

34:51.130 --> 34:52.190
Caitlin Bruce.

34:54.239 --> 34:56.079
Warden's office.

34:56.090 --> 34:57.079
Okay.

34:57.090 --> 34:58.135
New shipment's at the gate

34:58.136 --> 34:59.179
from Fort Collins.

34:59.190 --> 35:00.280
You reach Denver?

35:00.289 --> 35:02.030
Uh, no.

35:02.039 --> 35:03.159
Nothing.

35:03.170 --> 35:04.976
- There might be something wrong
- with the radio.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.170
It's just static.

35:12.050 --> 35:14.199
Hello.

35:14.210 --> 35:17.050
They don't know anything yet.

35:17.059 --> 35:19.079
They don't know about stealing

35:19.080 --> 35:21.099
the food, selling it.

35:21.110 --> 35:24.179
Or shipping prisoners east.

35:24.190 --> 35:28.019
They said they'd contact me.

35:28.030 --> 35:30.000
- I could still get you
- out of this,

35:30.010 --> 35:31.239
But not if I'm dead.

35:40.070 --> 35:42.230
Put her to work in the mines.

35:42.239 --> 35:43.725
Gotta make sure everything

35:43.726 --> 35:45.210
looks normal, right?

35:45.219 --> 35:47.010
- While you're at it
- get me someone

35:47.019 --> 35:48.260
To fix that goddamn radio.

35:48.269 --> 35:50.039
Yes, sir.

35:50.050 --> 35:51.199
What about the other guy?

35:51.210 --> 35:53.059
The experiment?

35:53.070 --> 35:55.019
Oh, he stays where he is.

35:56.090 --> 35:57.230
Mm.

35:57.239 --> 35:59.230
- I wanna see how much
- he can take.

36:20.119 --> 36:23.239
What the hell do we got here?

36:23.250 --> 36:24.745
I was about to ask you

36:24.746 --> 36:26.239
the same question.

36:44.119 --> 36:46.099
- What's with taking all
- my weapons at the gate?

36:46.110 --> 36:48.230
- Nobody carries in here
- except for me and the guards.

36:48.239 --> 36:49.725
Best practise in a prison,

36:49.726 --> 36:51.210
you know?

36:51.219 --> 36:53.130
You run this place?

36:53.139 --> 36:55.260
It's just a little sideline.

36:55.269 --> 36:58.059
You got my bourbon?

36:58.070 --> 36:59.585
No, all they had was

36:59.586 --> 37:01.099
this bathtub bullshit.

37:02.030 --> 37:03.159
So what's all this then?

37:03.170 --> 37:05.050
Everything else you ordered.

37:05.059 --> 37:06.159
Guns, ammo.

37:10.219 --> 37:12.099
Is the radio really broken?

37:12.110 --> 37:13.119
How should I know?

37:13.130 --> 37:15.050
- You better figure out which side
- of this you're on.

37:15.059 --> 37:16.150
I don't decide anything.

37:16.159 --> 37:17.150
We're running out of time.

37:17.159 --> 37:19.130
- How long do you think I can
- tap dance

37:19.139 --> 37:20.170
Before he just kills us all?

37:20.179 --> 37:22.070
Holy shit!

37:22.079 --> 37:23.079
What?

37:23.090 --> 37:24.119
Uh, don't look.

37:24.130 --> 37:25.059
What?

37:25.070 --> 37:26.170
- Yell at me. Yell at
- me right now

37:26.179 --> 37:27.170
And shove me to the ground.

37:27.179 --> 37:28.159
Let go!

37:28.170 --> 37:29.170
Let go of me!

37:29.179 --> 37:30.150
I said get moving!

37:30.159 --> 37:31.239
- Get your hands
- off me!

37:31.250 --> 37:33.130
Let's go!

37:33.139 --> 37:35.030
Let's go! Come on!

37:37.079 --> 37:39.139
Looks good.

37:39.150 --> 37:40.190
I want my whisky though.

37:40.199 --> 37:41.179
The real stuff.

37:41.190 --> 37:42.190
I mean, life sucks enough

37:42.191 --> 37:43.190
as it is, right?

37:43.199 --> 37:44.210
Sober?

37:44.219 --> 37:45.219
Hm.

37:45.230 --> 37:47.079
Me.

37:47.250 --> 37:49.070
Here.

37:49.250 --> 37:50.179
- Take this, drive through
- the night,

37:50.190 --> 37:52.170
You can be back by morning.

37:54.099 --> 37:55.210
Axel.

37:59.239 --> 38:01.099
See you in the morning.

38:01.110 --> 38:03.119
Atta boy.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.219
Come on.

38:19.139 --> 38:20.230
What was that about?

38:20.239 --> 38:23.139
Nothing, apparently.

38:59.079 --> 39:00.250
Hey.

39:00.260 --> 39:03.030
Hey, wait up there.

39:07.010 --> 39:08.150
Hey.

39:12.110 --> 39:14.099
What happened to me?

39:14.110 --> 39:15.269
You don't remember?

39:19.280 --> 39:22.250
I was bit.

39:22.260 --> 39:27.130
And then... I was on fire,

39:27.131 --> 39:32.000
and... oh god. What if-

39:32.010 --> 39:33.000
No.

39:33.010 --> 39:34.000
No, no, no. Stay calm.

39:34.010 --> 39:35.219
Hey, you're not one of them.

39:35.230 --> 39:36.269
Okay?

39:36.280 --> 39:40.269
You're not.

39:40.280 --> 39:43.099
Then what am I?

39:43.110 --> 39:45.165
I don't have all the answers,

39:45.166 --> 39:47.219
but the vampire that bit you,

39:47.230 --> 39:50.179
she's human again.

39:50.190 --> 39:51.269
How is that possible?

39:51.280 --> 39:53.690
All I know is Vanessa could do

39:53.691 --> 39:56.099
the same thing you did.

39:56.110 --> 39:57.260
What are you talking about?

39:57.269 --> 40:00.119
Tabby, she got bit, too.

40:00.130 --> 40:01.260
She was turned.

40:01.269 --> 40:03.260
But Vanessa turned her back.

40:03.269 --> 40:05.280
That's how I know for sure.

40:08.280 --> 40:11.269
What's wrong?

40:11.280 --> 40:13.179
It's nothing.

40:13.190 --> 40:14.219
Does it hurt?

40:14.230 --> 40:17.170
I don't know.

40:17.179 --> 40:19.230
It's... like a pull.

40:19.239 --> 40:23.170
Like I need to go find her.

40:23.179 --> 40:24.219
What are you-

40:24.230 --> 40:25.260
what are you talking about?

40:25.269 --> 40:27.130
Find her where?

40:27.139 --> 40:28.110
I don't know, I...

40:28.119 --> 40:29.269
- Just give yourself time
- to fully heal.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.285
No, Chad. I gotta go

40:30.286 --> 40:31.289
find her now.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.139
Chad...

40:33.150 --> 40:34.269
Please.

41:00.130 --> 41:01.650
You sure this is

41:01.651 --> 41:03.170
what you wanna do?

41:03.179 --> 41:04.289
Yeah.

41:06.139 --> 41:08.130
Well, no.

41:08.139 --> 41:12.230
But I know I've gotta go.

41:12.239 --> 41:14.739
Say bye to Tabby for me,

41:14.740 --> 41:17.239
and everyone else.

41:17.250 --> 41:19.289
Okay.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.070
You saved her life,

41:21.071 --> 41:22.139
you know.

41:22.150 --> 41:24.150
Tabby's.

41:24.159 --> 41:28.250
So you saved mine, too.

41:28.260 --> 41:30.250
- You would have done
- the same.

41:33.190 --> 41:36.675
Um... you know, I don't know

41:36.676 --> 41:40.159
how to say this but...

41:40.170 --> 41:42.685
I think you might be part of

41:42.686 --> 41:45.199
the answer to all of this.

41:45.210 --> 41:51.260
You're part of the way out.

41:51.269 --> 41:53.250
I have to go.

41:53.260 --> 41:55.139
Yeah.

41:55.150 --> 41:56.250
Um...

42:04.059 --> 42:07.239
Here. Okay.

42:08.030 --> 42:10.250
That's good, yeah.

42:14.269 --> 42:16.170
I hope you find her.

42:16.179 --> 42:18.059
I will.

42:18.070 --> 42:19.280
I have to.
