00:14.280 --> 00:17.720
This is Air Force One,
declaring an emergency.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.200
We're not gonna make it.
I have to put it down.

00:20.280 --> 00:22.120
Chloe, what's happening?

00:22.200 --> 00:24.800
- " Air Force One, you copy?"
- " Chloe?

00:24.880 --> 00:26.840
Air Force One is down.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.200
This may be him.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.400
It's the president.

00:33.640 --> 00:37.400
He's still alive. I repeat, the president is alive.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.160
Marwan has to be in a 50 mile radius...

00:40.240 --> 00:42.840
- There's a higher priority than Marwan.
- What?

00:42.920 --> 00:46.680
- Recovering the nuclear football.
- " Didn't it go with Air Force One?

00:46.760 --> 00:50.000
The missile inflicted enough damage
that it left debris.

00:50.080 --> 00:52.520
A lot was sucked out,
including the football.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.640
That case contains the codes and locations
of our entire nuclear arsenal.

00:56.720 --> 01:00.320
- What's the location of the football?
- 40 miles northeast of here, in the desert.

01:03.760 --> 01:09.160
Air Support, the football is in the lead Jeep,
headed north. Take it out.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.240
I've got the football.
Three hostiles down, one escaped.

01:19.320 --> 01:22.280
I'm not positive, but I think it was Marwan.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.680
There are pages missing.
Tell me the contents of the pages.

01:25.760 --> 01:29.560
It's the section which contains
warhead locations and activation codes.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.520
If they get ahold
of a warhead and a matching code,

01:32.600 --> 01:34.560
we will not be able to stop them.

01:34.640 --> 01:39.200
Mr Vice President, President Keeler is alive,
but he's in critical condition.

01:39.280 --> 01:43.720
Sir, I recommend you invoke the 25th
Amendment and take control of things.

01:43.800 --> 01:49.040
- You're worried about him.
- I am. He seems unsure of himself.

01:49.120 --> 01:53.360
I solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute
the office of the president.

01:53.440 --> 01:58.440
Preserve, protect and defend
the constitution of the United States.

01:58.520 --> 02:02.640
Mr President.
I've just received a phone call from CTU.

02:02.720 --> 02:07.840
Part of the nuclear football
has fallen into the hands of terrorists.

02:16.280 --> 02:20.560
Vice President Logan has been sworn in.
He is now President of the United States.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.640
His office called.
They want an update in 15 minutes.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.480
We're working on several protocols.
What is he gonna want to focus on?

02:27.560 --> 02:30.680
How a Stealth fighter was stolen
from one of our air bases.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.600
More to the point, how it took down
Air Force One with one of our missiles.

02:34.680 --> 02:38.120
- Is he briefed on Marwan?
- " He knows he's behind today,

02:38.200 --> 02:42.080
but he's gonna want specifics on the football.
Where are we on that?

02:42.160 --> 02:44.160
Jack's at the debris field.

02:44.240 --> 02:48.320
- He's trying to reconstruct the stolen chapter.
- How?

02:48.400 --> 02:51.120
He's working with Fred Laughton
from the DOD.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.240
- He wrote it, he'll know what's missing.
- " Good.

02:54.320 --> 02:58.720
- Who's going to run point on this update?
- You and Tony.

02:58.800 --> 03:02.120
All right, we don't have a lot of time,
so fast-track this.

03:02.200 --> 03:05.400
Double source all intel
through Homeland Security and CIA.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.960
Skip the usual request procedures.
Tie in to their data directly.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.280
- Yes?
- " I've got Bauer on the line."

03:11.360 --> 03:13.640
Put him through.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.160
Go ahead.

03:15.240 --> 03:18.960
- Are you still in briefing?
- "Yes, on speaker. What have you found?"

03:19.040 --> 03:22.840
Laughton and I finished a reconstruction.
We're getting that to you.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.080
Jack, it's Bill Buchanan.
Summarise our exposure.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.040
What information does Marwan
have in his possession?

03:29.120 --> 03:34.200
The location of our domestic nuclear arsenal.
The inventory's in the thousands.

03:34.280 --> 03:37.480
Many weapons are in transit
as part of standard operations.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.640
Why can't DOD secure these weapons?

03:39.720 --> 03:44.000
A number are between checkpoints. It'd take
over an hour to account for all of them.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.880
Listen, we've gotta remember,
Marwan only needs one.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.800
All right. We'll get on this.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.280
Get back here as soon as you can
and help Audrey liaise with DOD.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.840
We need to account for every single weapon.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.640
I'm on my way.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.520
The coordinates for the third one are:

04:03.600 --> 04:06.760
Latitude 37 degrees, 14 minutes,

04:06.840 --> 04:08.880
longitude, 115 degrees,

04:08.960 --> 04:11.760
21 minutes.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.120
There it is. Jefferson City, lowa.

04:17.200 --> 04:22.360
- When is the warhead due to arrive?
- 7am local time. Five hours from now.

04:22.440 --> 04:26.760
That puts it somewhere 200 miles east.
It's still in Illinois.

04:26.840 --> 04:31.040
We can intercept it anywhere
from this point to here.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.560
All right. Let's put our people in place.

04:40.240 --> 04:44.720
Warheads in transit because of shift-and-hide
operations pose the biggest problem.

04:44.800 --> 04:50.040
We can verify military traffic in coastal areas
from here. Find what DOD has in the Midwest.

04:50.120 --> 04:56.160
Yeah, that's already underway. Audrey
said she should have it in a few minutes.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.760
Look, Tony...

05:00.880 --> 05:03.680
- Am I interrupting something?
- No, Chloe. What is it?

05:03.760 --> 05:05.560
- Are you logged on?
- Yeah.

05:05.640 --> 05:10.920
Look. 15 minutes ago, the credit card of Eric
Murphy was used at Western Gas in Torrance.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.760
- Who's Eric Murphy?
- His real name is Yosik Khatami.

05:13.840 --> 05:16.640
- He's affiliated with Marwan.
- How do we know that?

05:16.720 --> 05:20.840
Our watch list. We put out a net asking
for anybody connected to Habib Marwan.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.000
- We didn't expect any hits so soon.
- Why was he so careless?

05:24.080 --> 05:26.280
Maybe he wasn't. Maybe it's a decoy.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.240
It wouldn't be much of a decoy
because we don't know where he is.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.760
- This was a mistake.
- Did the gas station have a camera?

05:33.840 --> 05:37.320
- Yes. He's driving a Lexus.
- " Are we on the satellite?

05:37.400 --> 05:42.680
Yes, we're monitoring them now.
If this guy's still on the road, we'll find him.

05:42.760 --> 05:47.000
- Who do we have in the area to run point?
- Curtis left Division. He's headed here.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.640
Divert him. Have Field Ops meet him there.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.720
All right.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.080
- "Audrey."
- It's me.

05:59.160 --> 06:03.640
- Hey. Are you on your way back here?
- Yeah. How much weaponry's accounted for?

06:03.720 --> 06:07.440
72 per cent. We have problems
getting confirmations from the Midwest.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.800
- Why?
- There were convoys shipping weapons

06:09.880 --> 06:12.840
to be dismantled
under the arms reduction treaty.

06:12.920 --> 06:15.680
A lot were rerouted
after the bombing this morning.

06:15.760 --> 06:19.920
Use local channels. Weapon transports
check in with regional substations.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
- Just call them directly.
- All right. I'll do that.

06:23.920 --> 06:26.600
How are you holding up?

06:26.680 --> 06:28.360
I'm OK.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.600
What have the doctors told you about Paul?

06:34.120 --> 06:37.320
They're having a hard time
keeping him stable.

06:37.400 --> 06:40.760
Just hang in there. He'll fight through it.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.760
Yeah.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.320
- Tell Michelle I'll be there in 20 minutes.
- All right, will do. Bye.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.720
- Yes?
- Marwan, it's... it's me.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.960
- Is everything all right?
- "No."

07:09.040 --> 07:10.880
No, it's not. I...

07:10.960 --> 07:13.160
I made a stupid mistake.

07:13.240 --> 07:16.160
- They're gonna find me.
- What happened?

07:16.240 --> 07:21.400
I stopped to get gas. While I was driving
away, I realised I used the wrong credit card -

07:21.480 --> 07:24.200
the one with the name Murphy.
The one you gave me.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.280
I told you to get rid of that one.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.600
I was in a hurry, Habib. I had to make
arrangements for delivery of the warhead.

07:30.680 --> 07:33.520
When that gets flagged,
they'll search the highways.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.600
- I know. I'm not on the highway any more.
- Where are you?

07:36.680 --> 07:39.680
Inglewood. I'm on my way to Prado's now.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.480
You're closer to the marina.
Go straight there, I'll have him meet you.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.200
Prado will help you get out of the country.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.160
Thank you, Habib. Thank you.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.280
Mr President, it may be precipitous
moving to the bunker now.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.360
Working from the Oval Office

08:01.440 --> 08:06.000
might exhibit a greater sense of confidence
in our abilities to handle this crisis.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.480
The purpose of the bunker
is to protect the president, is it not?

08:09.560 --> 08:12.440
- Yes, sir.
- Well...

08:12.520 --> 08:16.920
I feel it is always wiser
to take the prudent course.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.320
Will I be able to function at 100 per cent here?

08:55.400 --> 08:59.120
- Absolutely, Mr President.
- What protection does this bunker afford?

08:59.200 --> 09:00.920
Total.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.320
You're 200 feet below the surface.

09:03.400 --> 09:06.880
If the White House suffers a direct hit,
everyone would be safe,

09:06.960 --> 09:10.480
as would communication infrastructure
to the rest of the country.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.360
Let's hope that's not needed.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.480
- " Yes?
- Mr Buchanan is on the line. He's asked...

09:25.560 --> 09:29.600
Mr President,
Bill Buchanan from CTU is on the line.

09:33.800 --> 09:36.320
Hello, Bill. What do you have for me?

09:36.400 --> 09:40.080
I'm here with Michelle Dessler,
director of CTU Los Angeles,

09:40.160 --> 09:42.240
and Tony Almeida, heading tactical.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.920
Let's get started.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.320
Have all of our armaments
referenced in the red chapter been secured?

09:48.400 --> 09:51.800
Not completely, Mr President,
but we're working with DOD on it.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.840
- What else?
- The man who choreographed today's events,

09:54.920 --> 09:59.120
Habib Marwan, is at large. Most likely,
he is in possession of the red chapter.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.800
- What are we doing?
- " We picked up a thread.

10:01.880 --> 10:07.360
We have a location where one of Marwan's
associates was detected 20 minutes ago.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.440
That sounds promising. What else?

10:10.520 --> 10:15.640
We're sifting through intel, hoping
to put together a pursuit scenario soon.

10:15.720 --> 10:20.280
So you're pretty confident you'll be able
to catch this terrorist, this Habib Marwan,

10:20.360 --> 10:24.240
- before he strikes again?
- " It's not an exact science, sir."

10:24.320 --> 10:27.280
All we can do is maximise
the probability for success.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.440
- "There are no guarantees."
- Of course, I understand that.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.960
We need to get control of the situation.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.880
I can't govern from here indefinitely,
but I'm not going until it's safe.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.800
Sir.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.000
Their time is better spent
working up what they have.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.080
I recommend we let them get back to it.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.640
OK, Bill.

10:56.720 --> 10:59.520
Call us when you have
something more concrete.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.160
Yes, sir.

11:05.280 --> 11:08.680
All right. Let's get back to work.

11:10.080 --> 11:14.080
Wait a second. Does anybody else
feel uneasy about what we just heard here?

11:14.160 --> 11:15.600
In what way?

11:15.680 --> 11:20.280
Logan's supposed to be the man who speaks
to this country and exudes confidence,

11:20.360 --> 11:23.120
not fear.

11:25.120 --> 11:28.800
Air Force One was just attacked,
Keeler's in critical condition.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.440
- Logan was just sworn in. Give him time.
- We don't have time.

11:32.520 --> 11:36.360
We've got Khatami, heading toward the coast.
We have him on satellite.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.120
Link this up to Curtis.
I want him running point.

11:39.200 --> 11:45.400
Tell Curtis to remain discreet. I wanna know
what Khatami's doing before we take him.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.400
Michelle.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.560
I was out of line a couple of hours ago
about you and Bill.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.920
It's your life,
and I've got no right to judge you.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.240
I appreciate that.

12:21.320 --> 12:26.000
Whatever tension there is between us,
I want to apologise for my part in it.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.680
I'd like it if we could just let it go
so we could do our jobs.

12:29.760 --> 12:33.320
Leave the past in the past, and move on.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.800
Sounds good.

12:37.160 --> 12:38.680
All right.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.600
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

12:52.680 --> 12:54.880
Curtis is about to arrive at the marina.

12:54.960 --> 12:58.040
- Set up a satellite, also an audio link.
- I'll take care of it.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.640
- " Thanks.
- You want me to run point?

13:00.720 --> 13:04.680
No, Bill and I will do that,
but I want you in on this.

13:04.760 --> 13:08.480
- To do what?
- I'd like your tactical input.

13:08.560 --> 13:14.400
Fine. I'll have Edgar transfer
everything over to the situation room.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.480
Edgar.

13:18.520 --> 13:23.760
I get the feeling Tony's not entirely
comfortable with the configuration today.

13:23.840 --> 13:27.240
We haven't seen each other for a long time.
It's uncomfortable.

13:27.320 --> 13:31.840
The difference is you seem to be able
to stay on point. I'm not so sure about him.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.160
I am. He'll be fine.

14:26.880 --> 14:29.080
- He's alone.
- What's he doing?

14:29.160 --> 14:31.440
Looks like a meet. He's waiting for someone.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.760
- Is the marine unit in place?
- They're behind the jetty.

14:46.880 --> 14:50.320
The man he's meeting's just arrived.
He's walking towards him.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.160
- Is it Marwan?
- I can't tell.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.520
Remember, Curtis, we need them both alive.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.560
I copy.

14:56.640 --> 15:01.440
All right, teams, I'll close up for the pier.
Keep them contained, but do not shoot to kill.

15:01.520 --> 15:05.000
Repeat, do not shoot to kill.

15:18.040 --> 15:21.200
Dammit! Teams, respond. Who is that?

15:21.280 --> 15:24.000
This is McKellan.
It looks like a private patrol.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.760
All right, hold your positions.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.720
Yosik.

15:28.800 --> 15:32.320
Prado. You're late.
I've been standing here waiting for you.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.760
I'm here now. Let's go.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.120
- Come on. What are we waiting for?
- Wait.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.400
- What's the matter?
- Someone's here.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.840
It's Miller. U-base is clear.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.600
It's OK. It's just harbour security.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.520
No, something's wrong. They're onto us.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.920
Yosik, now!

16:13.280 --> 16:16.000
The man he's meeting is not Marwan.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.960
- Is anybody else there besides them?
- No, unless someone's on the boat.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.440
Marine units, move into position.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.400
All teams, move in.

16:50.080 --> 16:54.200
- We're OK. We should just get out of here.
- There was a police officer there.

16:54.280 --> 16:59.520
I told you, that's harbour security.
They stop by all the time.

17:08.920 --> 17:11.520
Who the hell is that?

17:17.280 --> 17:19.960
This is CTU.
We have you completely surrounded.

17:20.040 --> 17:24.119
- " Yes. Where are you?"
- They found us. They're gonna get us.

17:24.200 --> 17:28.880
Yosik, you can't let that happen.
You cannot allow yourself to be captured.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.120
I understand.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.080
Also you have to kill Prado.
He knows too much.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.720
I'll do what's necessary.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.960
Yosik! Yosik!

17:43.040 --> 17:46.240
" Shots fired! Shots fired! Move in.

17:46.320 --> 17:49.800
Come out with your hands up.
You're surrounded. There's no escape.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.360
- " Coming out!
- " Drop the gun!

17:52.440 --> 17:56.200
- " Put the gun down!
- " Step off the boat. Get off the boat.

17:56.280 --> 17:59.280
There's a man inside.
I shot him. He was gonna kill me.

17:59.360 --> 18:03.920
He was trying to steal my boat.
It was self-defence.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.440
" Put your hands on your head.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.000
- Who are you? Who are you?
- Oh, Jesus.

18:11.080 --> 18:15.360
My name's Joe Prado.
I'm innocent. I have nothing to hide.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.480
- " Where's Yosik?
- He's dead. His phone was lying next to him.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.600
- Get him out of here.
- Let's go.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.080
- Secure the boat.
- " Yes, sir.

18:29.160 --> 18:33.480
Yosik's dead. We have the man he was
meeting. He says his name is Joe Prado.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.280
- Bring him in.
- Will do.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.640
We recovered Yosik's cellphone.
I'll report to you en route.

18:38.720 --> 18:42.000
Good work, Curtis. We're standing by.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.680
" Go ahead.

18:45.760 --> 18:48.560
What do you want to do?

18:49.840 --> 18:51.840
Control the situation.

18:51.920 --> 18:56.440
Make sure Prado doesn't talk
to the authorities. He can hurt us.

18:56.520 --> 19:00.520
- How do we get to him?
- We can't. Not directly.

19:12.800 --> 19:14.640
- " Hello."
- This is Marwan.

19:14.720 --> 19:18.280
- "Yes, Marwan?"
- Can you reach Amnesty Global at this hour?

19:18.360 --> 19:21.200
- "What do you need?"
- An attorney.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.520
Tell them that an innocent man
is being held without charges

19:24.600 --> 19:28.360
and is about to be tortured
at CTU Los Angeles.

19:29.600 --> 19:35.040
By God's grace, President Keeler survived.
But more than 75 others did not.

19:35.120 --> 19:39.200
I share in your grief and anger
over this tragedy.

19:39.280 --> 19:42.400
My family and I feel no differently
than every one of you.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.000
We are shocked, saddened,

19:45.080 --> 19:47.360
and maybe a little afraid.

19:47.440 --> 19:52.320
These terrorists have displayed once again
their indifference toward human life.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.480
They will pay for what they have done.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.600
- Bill, excuse me.
- "However, we must endure..."

19:57.680 --> 20:00.680
- There's a convoy missing.
- What?

20:00.760 --> 20:04.680
It was headed from Illinois to lowa.
It disappeared inside the border.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.280
- " Disappeared?
- They were due to call in. They didn't.

20:08.360 --> 20:10.520
I tried on comm sat, there was no reply.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.520
- Satellite?
- " Nothing.

20:12.600 --> 20:16.840
- What was on the trucks?
- A nuclear warhead.

20:19.800 --> 20:23.760
Our faith and our resolve will prevail.

20:32.440 --> 20:36.840
... the files I sent. Have Prado's
information for me as soon as I get back.

20:36.920 --> 20:40.200
OK, we've got the prints.
I'll run them through our databases.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.880
Thanks.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.000
What do we know about the prisoner?

20:44.080 --> 20:46.120
Just the name he gave - Joe Prado.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.240
Curtis uploaded his prints.
I'm running through them.

20:49.320 --> 20:52.280
Prep Holding
so Curtis can begin interrogation.

20:52.360 --> 20:54.760
I want this man broken in minutes, not hours.

20:54.840 --> 20:59.040
Clear all directories.
Put all resources into finding this warhead.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.440
Mike, I wish I'd known about this sooner too.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.360
Look, I'm not pointing fingers here.
I'm on your side.

21:04.440 --> 21:08.680
But the president is not going to be happy
that his statement can be invalidated.

21:08.760 --> 21:13.240
I don't know what to tell you. We're
putting everything into finding this warhead.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.520
All right. Let me get back to you.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.680
" Move!

21:22.280 --> 21:25.240
Inside. Let's go. Move. Move, move!

21:27.280 --> 21:29.680
Get in, get in.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.840
We have it. We're heading out now.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.360
Sir.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.120
General Thomas told me
we're missing a warhead.

21:56.200 --> 22:00.160
- I just heard some details from Buchanan.
- When did this happen?

22:00.240 --> 22:06.160
- It disappeared between 1:45am and 2:15.
- And none of our satellites picked this up?

22:06.240 --> 22:09.960
It was mountain terrain at night.
People are analysing the imagery,

22:10.040 --> 22:13.000
but it's going to be hard to find.

22:14.160 --> 22:16.320
What will we do if we don't find Marwan?

22:16.400 --> 22:22.000
Our people are doing everything to contain
him. It's going to be difficult for him to leave.

22:22.080 --> 22:27.320
It's difficult to shoot Air Force One with
our own Stealth fighter, but he managed that.

22:27.400 --> 22:31.360
Who knows what they're planning?
I'm sure he's gonna come after me next.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.840
There's no indication that that's his plan.

22:33.920 --> 22:39.920
You don't know that. We don't have
enough information to know what his plan is.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.000
Head of Secret Service
is on his way over now.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.240
He has a revised plan,

22:47.320 --> 22:52.000
and I'm certain it will ease your mind
about your safety.

23:00.680 --> 23:04.000
That's the bastard from the marina,
helping the terrorists.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.640
I guess.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.720
" Sir, holding room B is ready.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.080
I'd like to get him in a room for a few minutes.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.640
What?

23:12.720 --> 23:16.080
He'd talk to me in about two seconds.

23:16.160 --> 23:20.560
Oh, you wanna hurt him to get revenge
for your mother dying. I can understand that.

23:20.640 --> 23:25.160
"..." images processed immediately.
Take him to Holding.

23:25.240 --> 23:28.840
- Did Edgar run the prints?
- Name checks out. Joe Prado, ex-marine.

23:28.920 --> 23:33.040
No criminal record. But over
the last five years, no record of employment.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.920
- Which means he's a criminal or a mercenary.
- Right.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.880
- I'll find out if he knows about the warhead.
- All right.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.480
- " Tony.
- What have you got?

23:42.560 --> 23:45.680
I found the convoy. I just got off
with lowa Highway Patrol.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.840
Military transport was ambushed.
Everyone's dead.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.000
- What about the warhead?
- Gone.

23:52.080 --> 23:56.440
Find out what they'd need to transport it.
Tell law enforcement to put up perimeters.

23:56.520 --> 23:59.800
Check airstrips or clearings
where they might put a chopper.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.880
Yeah.

24:07.040 --> 24:10.440
Remember he's an ex-marine.
He won't cave easily.

24:10.520 --> 24:16.960
I need to establish that even though we're in a
government building, I'll go as far as it takes.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.920
- How are you gonna start?
- I'll use Richards.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.240
OK.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.960
I told you I'm not talking to you, pal.

24:38.040 --> 24:41.160
I haven't been charged,
I haven't done anything wrong.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.880
I killed in self-defence.
He was stealing my boat.

24:43.960 --> 24:48.960
We both know that's a lie. So let's not waste
each other's time. What do you say, Joe?

24:49.040 --> 24:53.200
- I'm not saying anything to you.
- Highly unlikely.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.320
What the hell is this?

25:14.440 --> 25:16.440
- Yes?
- " Where's Curtis?"

25:16.520 --> 25:19.600
- He's just about to start with Prado.
- "Tell him to stop."

25:19.680 --> 25:22.600
- What?
- "That's an order. Come to the floor, now."

25:22.680 --> 25:26.080
- It was self-defence. You can't do this.
- " Curtis."

25:26.160 --> 25:29.640
- What?
- Buchanan wants to see us before you start.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.920
Wait till I get back.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.320
- What's this about?
- I don't know.

25:57.480 --> 26:01.440
We have a problem.
This is David Weiss from Amnesty Global.

26:01.520 --> 26:07.120
I have a court order protecting the rights
of Joseph Prado whom you have in custody.

26:07.200 --> 26:11.000
This US marshal is here to assure
I'm taken to the prisoner immediately.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.240
- Ridiculous.
- That's your opinion.

26:13.320 --> 26:17.000
But Mr Prado's rights will not be violated.
Take me to him now.

26:17.080 --> 26:20.960
- We have no choice, Curtis.
- A warhead's missing. This is our only lead.

26:21.040 --> 26:27.080
I'll get into this with the Justice Department.
In the meantime, do what he says.

26:42.800 --> 26:48.240
" When can I expect his call?
It's extremely important.

26:48.320 --> 26:52.440
I understand that, but I need to talk
to the judge. Please have him call me back.

26:52.520 --> 26:55.160
- Mr Buchanan.
- Do you have those hourlies for me?

26:55.240 --> 26:58.400
- No, I don't. But I'm here on another matter.
- What?

26:58.480 --> 27:01.920
I heard Prado's interrogation is on hold. Why?

27:02.000 --> 27:04.120
You have ajob to do.
Please get back to it.

27:04.200 --> 27:08.600
I know I'm not supposed to interfere, but
considering what I've been through today -

27:08.680 --> 27:11.080
my mother dying because of these terrorists -

27:11.160 --> 27:14.360
I wanna know why we're letting
some lawyer protect Prado.

27:14.440 --> 27:17.120
We're gonna fix it,
but it's gonna take some time.

27:17.200 --> 27:20.720
- That's time we don't have.
- Edgar, stop.

27:20.800 --> 27:23.920
I'm trying to cut you some slack,
but get back to your job.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.960
You need to put all that other stuff
on hold for a while, please.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.200
Yes, sir.

27:33.120 --> 27:37.000
Buchanan. Yes, I'll hold for the judge.

27:37.080 --> 27:41.720
- You're supposed to be doing the hourlies.
- I don't know why everybody's telling me.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.840
I have a photographic memory.

27:43.920 --> 27:47.480
How could I forget?
You tell me, like, every other day.

27:47.560 --> 27:51.640
I don't like what's happening - some
PC lawyer's holding us up from ourjob.

27:51.720 --> 27:56.600
Your job is to do the hourlies.
You're holding yourself up.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.720
- Chloe.
- Have you heard about the warhead?

28:07.800 --> 28:10.600
Yeah. FBI link up
with lowa Sheriff's Department?

28:10.680 --> 28:13.720
- Yes.
- OK, good. Who's questioning the prisoner?

28:13.800 --> 28:16.000
- Prado, the guy Curtis brought in?
- Yeah.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.560
- No one.
- What are you talking about?

28:18.640 --> 28:23.040
An attorney came in with an order saying
we weren't allowed to be alone with Prado.

28:23.120 --> 28:26.280
Buchanan's on the phone
with the judge who signed the order.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.840
I'll be right back. I don't believe this.

28:29.920 --> 28:35.040
I disagree. This does not fall outside
the boundary of the Patriot Act.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.880
- Thanks.
- What's going on?

28:36.960 --> 28:40.080
You've got a key witness.
We should be pressing this guy.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.600
Judge Norton won't budge.
We have to take it to an appellate judge.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.720
- Does he know what the stakes are?
- He does, but Prado's got no record.

28:47.800 --> 28:51.600
What about the fact he was meeting
a terrorist in the middle of the night?

28:51.680 --> 28:53.040
Circumstantial.

28:53.120 --> 28:56.600
We need to interrogate this prisoner.
I don't care about the order.

28:56.680 --> 29:00.560
I agree, but his attorney's with him,
and a marshal protecting his rights.

29:00.640 --> 29:04.240
- Where's his attorney?
- Holding, with Prado. Don't make it worse.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.120
I just want to talk to him.

29:06.200 --> 29:10.160
- How much longer do I have to stay?
- I'm trying to get you out.

29:10.240 --> 29:12.400
My office is filing a complaint.

29:12.480 --> 29:15.240
They have nothing on me.
I was alone on my boat.

29:15.320 --> 29:18.240
I don't even know this man
that they were going after.

29:18.320 --> 29:20.920
Come in with me now.

29:25.240 --> 29:30.640
- Who are you?
- Bauer, Department of Defence. And you are?

29:30.720 --> 29:32.840
David Weiss, Amnesty Global.

29:34.480 --> 29:38.880
- Why is the suspect not in restraints?
- Amnesty's order supersedes our authority.

29:38.960 --> 29:42.160
My client is cooperating.
He's not trying to go anywhere.

29:42.240 --> 29:44.560
He wants to be treated like any US citizen.

29:44.640 --> 29:48.480
Your client aided and abetted
the people who attacked the president.

29:48.560 --> 29:51.360
- You don't know that.
- As a matter of fact, we do.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.840
Then charge him.

29:58.920 --> 30:01.240
May I speak with you privately?

30:02.240 --> 30:04.480
Get the door.

30:10.680 --> 30:15.560
You and I know your client isn't clean, and
that he conspired to steal a nuclear warhead.

30:15.640 --> 30:18.320
All my client wants is due process.

30:18.400 --> 30:22.240
Mr Weiss, these people
are not gonna stop attacking us today

30:22.320 --> 30:26.040
until millions and millions
of Americans are dead.

30:26.120 --> 30:30.360
I don't wanna bypass the constitution,
but they're extraordinary circumstances.

30:30.440 --> 30:35.400
The constitution was born out of
extraordinary circumstances, Mr Bauer.

30:35.480 --> 30:40.640
This plays out by the book.
Not in a back room with a rubber hose.

30:42.520 --> 30:45.480
I hope you can live with that.

31:07.120 --> 31:10.520
- Sir, can I help you?
- No, it's all right.

31:17.720 --> 31:21.240
- How'd you get here so fast?
- " What?

31:22.960 --> 31:27.840
- Who asked you to represent Mr Prado?
- I don't have to give you that information.

31:27.920 --> 31:31.280
From his arrest,
did the suspect have time to call a lawyer?

31:31.360 --> 31:33.360
" No.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.400
Marwan called Amnesty Global.
This is his play.

31:41.480 --> 31:44.960
That means Prado knows something
Marwan doesn't want us to hear.

31:45.040 --> 31:51.040
- We still can't get around that court order.
- We need to call the president now.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.760
We cannot have leaks
regarding this missing warhead.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.160
I've contacted General Wilson in lowa.

31:59.240 --> 32:02.880
He's sealing off the roads
while we clean up the ambushed convoy.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.800
What about those Highway officers
who discovered it?

32:05.880 --> 32:09.200
Wilson's brought them in
and is explaining the situation.

32:09.280 --> 32:14.360
The good news is this is happening in the
middle of the night. The country's still asleep.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.120
Yes?

32:17.200 --> 32:23.440
CTU Los Angeles is on the line
for President Logan. They say it's urgent.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.080
Thank you, gentlemen. That'll be all.

32:27.680 --> 32:29.080
Walt.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.160
Stay.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.360
- " Put him through.
- " Go ahead."

32:44.440 --> 32:48.280
- This is Bill Buchanan. I'm with Jack Bauer.
- "Yes. What do you have for me?"

32:48.360 --> 32:53.160
In the process of trying to track down this
warhead, we've brought in a prime suspect.

32:53.240 --> 32:57.080
- What have you learned?
- Well, that's the problem. Our hands are tied.

32:57.160 --> 33:00.040
Amnesty Global has interceded on his behalf.

33:00.120 --> 33:05.120
- Interceded? On what grounds?
- He's a US citizen with no previous record.

33:05.200 --> 33:08.040
- Why is he a suspect?
- "We found him with Yosik Khatami,"

33:08.120 --> 33:10.120
a man linked to today's events.

33:10.200 --> 33:13.320
" It doesn't violate any law
to question a suspect.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.960
Mr President, if I may?

33:16.960 --> 33:19.320
Go ahead, Mike.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.440
- Jack, it's Mike Novick.
- Hi, Mike.

33:21.520 --> 33:24.840
Am I correct in assuming
this suspect is unlikely to respond

33:24.920 --> 33:27.360
to the kind of Q and A
his lawyer would permit?

33:27.440 --> 33:31.920
Correct. If we want information, we're gonna
have to do it behind closed doors.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.000
- Torture him?
- I'm talking about what is necessary

33:35.080 --> 33:37.400
to stop this warhead being used against us.

33:38.840 --> 33:41.040
Give us a moment, Bill.

33:46.120 --> 33:48.640
Mike, what do you think?

33:48.720 --> 33:53.200
I think we need to do whatever it takes
to find Marwan.

33:55.880 --> 33:57.680
Walt?

33:57.760 --> 34:00.240
Weigh in.

34:00.320 --> 34:03.040
- Well, this makes me nervous.
- Why?

34:03.120 --> 34:06.360
Should this man be innocent,
as he claims he is,

34:06.440 --> 34:10.480
your first act as president
is to sanction his torture.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.520
That'll forever haunt your presidency.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.480
All right, gentlemen.
Here's what I'll agree to.

34:28.560 --> 34:34.159
I'll call a session with members of the
Justice Department, and we'll discuss this.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.320
I'll have an answer in 20 minutes.

34:36.400 --> 34:41.000
- This thing could be over in 20 minutes.
- That's as far as I'm willing to go right now.

34:41.080 --> 34:45.400
With all due respect, sir,
please let us do ourjobs.

34:56.080 --> 34:59.000
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

35:05.880 --> 35:10.680
- I'll have Curtis start the interrogation.
- We can't afford to be wasting time.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.240
You heard. He won't let us touch this guy.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.840
The president's not here. You are.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.720
If I authorise this, they'll know.
We'll all be out.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.760
What if I find a way
that wouldn't implicate anyone but me?

35:21.840 --> 35:25.200
- I'm not gonna authorise that, Jack.
- You don't have to.

35:25.280 --> 35:28.240
- What do you mean?
- Accept my resignation.

35:28.320 --> 35:31.120
- And if I do that, what then?
- Release the suspect.

35:31.200 --> 35:34.640
- Release him?
- We don't question him, we don't charge him.

35:34.720 --> 35:38.040
He won't need a lawyer or a marshal.

35:38.120 --> 35:41.520
You're gonna take him on as a private citizen?

36:09.960 --> 36:12.080
- " Yes."
- How far away are you?

36:12.160 --> 36:14.840
32 miles.

36:15.800 --> 36:18.600
When you get there,
you'll meet with Morrison.

36:18.680 --> 36:21.880
- Is he going to configure the detonation?
- "Yes."

36:21.960 --> 36:24.000
I've given him the codes.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.080
OK.

36:25.880 --> 36:28.920
You have to follow the plan exactly, Sabir.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.720
We cannot give them time
to start an evacuation.

36:31.800 --> 36:34.800
- Yes, Marwan. I understand.
- No delays.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.520
It will be done.

36:46.720 --> 36:50.160
- Hey. When did you get back?
- A few minutes ago. Thanks.

36:50.240 --> 36:54.120
- I could use your help on the DOD interface.
- I can't help you now. Sorry.

36:54.200 --> 36:57.160
- What are you doing?
- I'll tell you when I get back.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.960
Jack?

36:59.040 --> 37:01.040
- Jack?
- Audrey, please.

37:06.320 --> 37:10.280
What are you trying to pull? You wanna
torture me, now you're throwing me out.

37:10.360 --> 37:14.480
- Right.
- They tried to fight the order and couldn't.

37:14.560 --> 37:18.440
No, that's not what this is.
They're doing something.

37:18.520 --> 37:22.880
- Don't be so paranoid. We're not interested.
- I want protection when I get out.

37:22.960 --> 37:27.240
- The marshal can escort you back...
- No! You know what - change of plan.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.920
I don't wanna leave here until I know I'm safe.

37:30.000 --> 37:35.400
If you don't leave, I'll have to arrest you for
trespassing in a secure government building.

37:35.480 --> 37:40.040
And once that happens,
not even your attorney can protect you.

37:40.120 --> 37:43.000
Correct me if I'm wrong, David.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.480
He's right.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.920
- What's going on?
- He's been released.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.480
- Why?
- I don't know. It came from Buchanan.

38:06.560 --> 38:09.160
- Why are you letting him go?
- Not now, please.

38:09.240 --> 38:13.720
- He's with the people that killed my mother.
- Not now.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.880
- Cheer up. You're a free man.
- " Yeah, right.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.960
- The marshal's gonna take you home.
- No! I can't go home.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.040
I gotta go somewhere public.

38:27.120 --> 38:32.520
Fine, tell him where you wanna go.
Don't let anyone know you're there.

38:32.600 --> 38:37.960
Here's my card. You call me
if anyone from CTU tries to bother you.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.560
Yeah, OK.

38:45.080 --> 38:47.560
You're gonna be fine.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.920
Make a sound and I will blow your brains
all over the windshield.

39:13.000 --> 39:16.120
Handcuff your left arm to the dashboard, now.

39:25.560 --> 39:27.560
Now we're gonna talk.

39:39.960 --> 39:44.480
Now, you and I both know your heart
isn't in this. You just wanted the money.

39:44.560 --> 39:47.200
I don't want you. All I want is Marwan.

39:47.280 --> 39:50.280
Marwan? I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:50.360 --> 39:56.280
Yeah. Well, I'm running out of time here,
so why don't we just cut to the chase?

39:56.800 --> 39:59.040
What?

39:59.120 --> 40:02.840
- Where's Marwan?
- I don't know! "

40:18.880 --> 40:21.360
Where is Marwan?

40:21.440 --> 40:25.360
- Where's Marwan?
- I don't know! I swear I don't know.

40:25.440 --> 40:30.320
OK, OK, OK. Marwan's... Marwan's
gonna be at a place called The Hub tonight.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.200
- Where is it?
- It's... It's just...

40:33.280 --> 40:38.000
- Where is it?
- Just east of downtown. East of downtown.

40:39.600 --> 40:42.600
This will help you with the pain.
