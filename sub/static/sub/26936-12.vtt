WEBVTT

00:00.350 --> 00:06.330
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island
look at that tip this is almost weapon light

00:06.330 --> 00:10.870
Wow Go down we have to have a look
at h8 so we're gonna run so our owners

00:10.870 --> 00:15.040
know there's a clear right angle is it
possible a here at the side of a rather

00:15.040 --> 00:22.050
large cavity yeah it's a cool no design
I've ever seen it could be incredibly

00:22.050 --> 00:33.890
old its concrete the Romans had come
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:33.890 --> 00:38.860
where people have been looking for an
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:38.860 --> 00:45.999
years so far they have found a stone
slab with strange symbols carved into it

00:45.999 --> 00:52.729
mysterious fragments of human bone and a
LED cross whose origin may stretch back

00:52.729 --> 00:57.940
to the days of the Knights Templar to
date six men have died trying tosolve

00:57.940 --> 01:04.459
the mystery
and according to legend one more will

01:04.459 --> 01:21.240
have to die before the treasure can be found
it is another new and exciting day on

01:21.240 --> 01:26.600
Oak IslandI've always thought h8 is the
money pit do you believe that's possible

01:26.600 --> 01:32.200
Craig it absolutely brothers Rick and
Marty lagina along with their partner

01:32.200 --> 01:38.000
Craig tester continue to make progress
not only in their quest to locate the

01:38.000 --> 01:42.540
original money pit but in the excavation
of other places on the island where

01:42.540 --> 01:48.859
treasure might be buried
last week while searching Smith's Cove

01:48.859 --> 01:52.970
for the remains of the stone box dragons
that have long been believed to feed

01:52.970 --> 01:56.600
sea water deep into the money pit the
timber right there

01:56.600 --> 02:04.859
Wow Rick and the team uncovered a series
of not wooden beams kind of signifies

02:04.859 --> 02:09.650
there's quite a load quite a load
expected

02:09.650 --> 02:13.260
beam's which could have been used as
part of an ancient slipway that was

02:13.260 --> 02:20.120
first discovered by Oak Island treasure
hunter Gilbert Heddenin 1936

02:20.120 --> 02:24.940
so far inaddition to finding the
slipway the team has also unearthed what

02:24.940 --> 02:30.530
appears tobe a portion of one of the
legendary box drains the mysterious you

02:30.530 --> 02:35.080
andl-shaped structures that were
previously discovered by Dan Blankenship

02:35.080 --> 02:41.520
in the 1970s and the remains of what
appears tobe a wooden wall

02:41.520 --> 02:45.630
Smith's Cove is yielding structure after
structure after structure most of it

02:45.630 --> 02:50.230
unknown clearly there were massive
efforts by searchers and maybe by

02:50.230 --> 02:55.250
original people over two hundred years
two centuries yeah and even before the

02:55.250 --> 02:58.980
discovery of the money pit so a lot of
people believe that they were doing

02:58.980 --> 03:05.230
something substantive want to tell you
what I'm most excited about that it's

03:05.230 --> 03:09.410
been a long hard slog out here this
excavation Smith's Cove and everything

03:09.410 --> 03:13.340
finally we're back to digging you know
I mean everything's in place we're back to

03:13.340 --> 03:20.450
dig absolutely today before heading No
heading over to Smith's Cove

03:20.450 --> 03:25.690
Marty Rick and Craig
begin their day at the place where they may

03:25.690 --> 03:28.230
be
finally closing in on the team's most

03:28.230 --> 03:33.450
important and elusive target Jared
Marley the original money pit treasure shaft

03:33.450 --> 03:39.200
Marty strongly believes it is located
very near the exploratory or hole they

03:39.200 --> 03:46.200
dug last year age eight it was at this
same location at somethingest area where

03:46.200 --> 03:50.570
the team discovered evidence of
everything from antique pottery pieces

03:50.570 --> 03:57.340
pieces of parchment and bits of book binding
to fragments of centuries-old human bones

03:57.340 --> 04:02.790
I was firmly convinced at the beginning of
this year that we needed to dig a jade

04:02.790 --> 04:07.230
let's see if we can capture some of the
material we missed last year

04:07.230 --> 04:10.770
it's irrefutable that the most
interesting finds and the money pit have

04:10.770 --> 04:15.310
from h8 there are we just starting to
grab what's going on for about an hour

04:15.310 --> 04:20.620
okay we got a foot and a half we're
dancing around 195 again saying that we

04:20.620 --> 04:22.490
starting to get hard and we're just
tarting to get

04:22.490 --> 04:23.810
hard and we're just getting a little

04:23.810 --> 04:28.040
what do you get mud a little bit of
granite granite and some pretty good

04:28.040 --> 04:34.240
granite slabs maybe this was the plug
that it started pushing everything down

04:34.240 --> 04:39.410
last year while trying to excavate the
HHM the team noticed that the drilling

04:39.410 --> 04:43.640
caiss on had hit something which could
have been the legendary Chappell vault

04:43.640 --> 04:48.390
the 7-foot tallwooden chest which was
first identified by treasure hunters

04:48.390 --> 04:53.780
William Chappell and Frederick Blair
back in 1897 right now we were

04:53.780 --> 04:56.730
definitely sitting on something it feels
like I'm on a whole bunch of wood at

04:56.730 --> 05:03.900
once unfortunately just as the team was
making progress anobject that they

05:03.900 --> 05:08.570
thought might be the Chappell vault was
pushed farther down into the mud and

05:08.570 --> 05:12.380
sediment
was in front of the cannon

05:12.380 --> 05:16.870
we're pushing it for a while
now before this year's Dig operation can

05:16.870 --> 05:21.630
resume the T from urban equipment
limited must first scoop outseveral

05:21.630 --> 05:25.470
feet of sediment and debris that is
settled at the bottom of their most

05:25.470 --> 05:31.389
promising target site borehole h8 right
now what we're dealing with is a big

05:31.389 --> 05:36.270
steel cylinder with a plug inthe bottom
so if we can't hammer the plug out we're

05:36.270 --> 05:43.081
certainly not gonna get anything new in
there vanessais there any reason why we

05:43.081 --> 05:47.720
can't start trying to rotate right now
and break that sealI would love your

05:47.720 --> 05:52.570
blessing to start oscillating I don't
see why we wouldn't either yeah you know

05:52.570 --> 05:56.270
that might even help the plug too if we
start moving that can yeah down fire it

05:56.270 --> 05:59.940
be oscillator okay fantastic
thank you hey Dan I got the blessing

05:59.940 --> 06:06.370
let's start twisting that can and try to
break it free let's fire up the

06:06.370 --> 06:09.730
oscillator
using the massive oscillators got her

06:09.730 --> 06:14.790
now the team will now slightlylift the
steel caisson in borehole h8 in an

06:14.790 --> 06:17.500
effort to break up the plug at the
bottom of the shaft

06:17.500 --> 06:25.740
it's catching on something
there it goes so great knock on wood

06:25.740 --> 06:34.680
thatit keeps going you're rotating it's
trying to pick up pretty odds definitely

06:34.680 --> 06:44.610
got pressured we're gonna keep on slow
but it's moving he's looking up for a

06:44.610 --> 06:49.260
breaksoon
be slow first gonna take a minute wiggle

06:49.260 --> 06:51.400
it out but I'm happy it'll come on
maybe we'll get out of here this year

06:51.400 --> 06:58.860
what we didn't last
as Marty and Craig continued to

06:58.860 --> 07:02.770
supervise the operationat the money
fair

07:02.770 --> 07:07.860
Rick lagina has joined geologist Terry
Matheson and archaeologist Laird Niven

07:07.860 --> 07:11.300
as they continued the team's massive
excavation of Smith's Cove

07:11.300 --> 07:26.500
a log across the bottom there's two of
them doing here on there

07:26.500 --> 07:31.430
this is probably part ofthe old truck
yeah so we had this slipway on top of

07:31.430 --> 07:36.220
the slipway
evidence of an ancient slipway at

07:36.220 --> 07:42.750
Smith's Cove is both exciting and
confusing if as Rick and members of the

07:42.750 --> 07:47.199
team suspectit was built and ordered to
haul ships out of the water and onto the

07:47.199 --> 08:05.510
shore was it to repair damage or person
positive who buried something of

08:05.510 --> 08:14.350
incredible value here on the island
hundreds of years ago they're consistent

08:14.350 --> 08:19.960
all across here yeah those are nice and
tight at the same thing that you have

08:19.960 --> 08:26.400
Laird I've got one here one here one
here here and there yep there's

08:26.400 --> 08:31.169
certainly popped inter oh yeah yeah so
packed tightly packed must be a rebuild

08:31.169 --> 08:37.389
over and all yes so let's take this slip
place you know people are slipping

08:37.389 --> 08:40.458
moving pulling boats ashore hard to
believe that something shouldn't be in

08:40.458 --> 08:45.939
here waiting forus hard to believe
there isn't as Rick and the team

08:45.939 --> 08:51.829
continue to expose more and more of the
mysterious slipway tons of excavated

08:51.829 --> 08:57.279
earth and materials have been taken over
to the massive wash plant located nearby

08:57.279 --> 09:00.290
where they will be claimed and sorted
according to size

09:00.290 --> 09:07.620
thank you wow you guys work fast we got
a Rick on the job here things happen

09:07.620 --> 09:12.029
pretty quickthere's a lid found
anything in the slipway anything more

09:12.029 --> 09:19.509
just glass you know relatively fresh
glass have a go okay I'll use no

09:19.509 --> 09:21.720
discrimination we want to dig everything
though

09:21.720 --> 09:38.410
no nothing in there
gota gayou live

09:38.410 --> 09:51.360
there you gotmy
holy crap

09:51.360 --> 09:59.899
this is almost weapon line
we've got the small ROV with us it is a

09:59.899 --> 10:03.929
scanning fona good to put the ROV down
the cat will start to get returns on the

10:03.929 --> 10:15.589
look at it this is almost weapon
life look at that tip while

10:15.589 --> 10:21.679
investigating the remains of a possible
ancient Duncan slipway at Smith's Cove

10:21.679 --> 10:26.699
metal detection expert Gary Drayton has
just made what could be the team's first

10:26.699 --> 10:32.309
significant discovery of the day look at
that tip that's almost like a heroin

10:32.309 --> 10:37.459
like the crossbow
almost looks like a Roman peeler it's

10:37.459 --> 10:44.319
wrought iron
a crossbowbolt earlier this year while

10:44.319 --> 10:49.179
searching for artifacts on the islands
south west shore look at this Jack

10:49.179 --> 10:54.579
Begley Gary Drayton and geophysicist
Mike West discovered a strikingly

10:54.579 --> 11:01.220
similar metal object further
investigation however suggested that the

11:01.220 --> 11:08.149
object could not only be much older what
it appears to be is Roman

11:08.149 --> 11:14.699
no way but part of a tip from an ancient
throwing spear known as a pileup which

11:14.699 --> 11:23.639
was used by soldiers of the Roman Empire
as farback as the 1st century BC it

11:23.639 --> 11:27.619
looks like it was shaped thatway Mike
oh yeah we assumed he would have had a

11:27.619 --> 11:31.720
half take a handle yeah you're right
that looks like a the tool or a weapon

11:31.720 --> 11:39.069
yeah cool no idea no idea
it's really cool

11:39.069 --> 11:46.970
it's hand-wrought Delia point is on
purpose

11:46.970 --> 11:52.259
look at the tip I don't know what to
make of it so certainly we're going to

11:52.259 --> 11:58.389
do scientific analysis is it possible
this is part of that original work of

11:58.389 --> 12:03.370
course it's possible but I want an
answer on definitive answer not modern

12:03.370 --> 12:08.449
I don't know what tomake of it well
this is getting interesting fines are

12:08.449 --> 12:14.800
coming up now let's see whatelse we can
find

12:14.800 --> 12:20.029
later that afternoon Rick lagina joins
his brother Marty in the war room or

12:20.029 --> 12:24.170
they have gathered with members of their
team to follow up on another recent and

12:24.170 --> 12:30.399
potentially historic find fellow ship
members alex has been working with this

12:30.399 --> 12:38.910
stone that has the potentially strange
perhaps runic symbols on it two weeks

12:38.910 --> 12:45.009
ago gyro survey expert Tory Martin
discovered an unusual stone slab while

12:45.009 --> 12:49.379
assembling his equipment in the money
pit area and definitely not natural even

12:49.379 --> 12:53.309
more intriguing was the strange
inscription that appeared to be carved

12:53.309 --> 12:58.810
on the rock surface after conducting a
laser scan of the stone the team met

12:58.810 --> 13:03.059
with representatives from azimuth
consulting limited who presented them

13:03.059 --> 13:08.179
with a stunningthree-dimensional
computer model it revealed characters

13:08.179 --> 13:13.329
that Doug Pro believed to be ancient
runes the letters that make up the early

13:13.329 --> 13:19.639
Germanic alphabets used as far back as
the second century AD

13:19.639 --> 13:24.410
this is a very curious stone if this
stone is authentic historically it's

13:24.410 --> 13:29.769
very important because it would be some
of the earliest proof of visitation if

13:29.769 --> 13:37.679
not habitation in Nova Scotiaby
Europeans Alex foundan expert dr. Lila

13:37.679 --> 13:41.519
Coco para yeah we've been looking for
anybody who might beable to help us

13:41.519 --> 13:45.149
with with this stone and you know maybe
tell us if there is or isn't an

13:45.149 --> 13:50.790
inscription so we can call her please
didn't ask her a few questions and see

13:50.790 --> 13:56.959
what she thinks
hi dr. dr. Lila Co parhe's the director

13:56.959 --> 14:01.200
of the Center fo rmedieval and Byzantine
studies atthe Catholic University of

14:01.200 --> 14:07.300
America in Washington DC she is also an
expertin rhinology and has written

14:07.300 --> 14:13.889
extensively about early medieval
iconography thank you for taking the

14:13.889 --> 14:18.589
time to talk with us I've sent you a few
details of this stone but we don't know

14:18.589 --> 14:22.050
for sure whether there is or is not an
inscription and and if there is we don't

14:22.050 --> 14:26.829
know what it could possibly mean so
that's why we're calling you today my

14:26.829 --> 14:30.869
pleasure! have the first question have
you seen at the images at all of this

14:30.869 --> 14:34.959
this stone we have I did see a few
images yes okay do you think it's worth

14:34.959 --> 14:38.980
a closer examination based on that it's
certainly very interesting

14:38.980 --> 14:44.420
it is unusual because of that relatively
straight line in the middleand the

14:44.420 --> 14:47.889
incisions on it
this might be an inscription but I need

14:47.889 --> 14:52.939
to look at ita bit closer and hear a
bit more about the context so what I

14:52.939 --> 14:56.930
would really need is as many close-ups
of the inscription as you can send me

14:56.930 --> 15:02.149
and images of all signs of the object
it's important to see all aspects of it

15:02.149 --> 15:06.399
if you wantto know something about the
job done because the inscription of an

15:06.399 --> 15:10.389
has something todo with the function we
did some measuring of the stone we did

15:10.389 --> 15:15.629
build sort of a 3d model of the stone
that we might be able to send you what's

15:15.629 --> 15:21.809
relevant is the find contact so very
exactly was it found are there any other

15:21.809 --> 15:27.089
objects nearby that may relate to this
this has something to do with what it

15:27.089 --> 15:33.089
could be the confusing thing abou tthis
stone in particular is it was in place

15:33.089 --> 15:37.549
and we never noticed it to be honest
with you it was sitting above ground it

15:37.549 --> 15:43.129
was next to a well that had been used by
searchers over the decades if not

15:43.129 --> 15:49.199
centuries it's in close proximity to the
money pit but we don't know if it came

15:49.199 --> 15:53.559
from undergroundor not it's extremely
flat surface as though it's been

15:53.559 --> 16:00.920
manipulated in order to have achieved
the raised carvings its context it's

16:00.920 --> 16:04.589
been lostin the mists of time so to
speak

16:04.589 --> 16:13.129
I think we understand the task let us
pull all that data together

16:13.129 --> 16:42.149
and
you

16:42.149 --> 16:46.259
with the candor so we have about a 10
foot open pilot hole

16:46.259 --> 16:50.799
Roscoe up higher or say where we're at
my suggestion would be pull up slowly

16:50.799 --> 16:57.790
incrementally to 170 issue wait for the
sonar introduce it okay that sounds good

16:57.790 --> 17:00.629
so we're gonna run
so when our then yes hopefully there's a

17:00.629 --> 17:05.689
big cavitythere or something yeah but
so far so good

17:05.689 --> 17:11.179
sounds good oka having broken through
the compacted earth and materials at the

17:11.179 --> 17:15.069
bottom of the shaft the team from urban
equipment limited

17:15.069 --> 17:20.310
it's made substantial progressin their
goal to raise the massive 50 inch white

17:20.310 --> 17:28.519
caisson from a depth of 213 feet to 170
feet once accomplished they will be able

17:28.519 --> 17:33.559
to use the 3-ton hammer grab tool to
excavate the contents of the hull or

17:33.559 --> 17:39.400
artifacts and hopefully treasure but
before that happens the Oak Island team

17:39.400 --> 17:45.280
has decided to first conduct a sonar
scan of h8 in the hopes of confirming

17:45.280 --> 17:50.510
the presence of an anomaly that recent
seismic scanning has suggested could be

17:50.510 --> 17:57.980
a large underground void or chamber
assisting the team with today's sonar

17:57.980 --> 18:04.250
operation or Mike Roberts and Joey Rolf
of dive tech limited we've got the small

18:04.250 --> 18:08.130
ROV with us
and on the ROV there's a scanning sona

18:08.130 --> 18:12.230
I'm interested to see what we've got
there especially if there aresome void

18:12.230 --> 18:16.260
so stuff I'm sure we'll pick the mup no
problem with this sonar okay well let's

18:16.260 --> 18:24.570
get after it yep because h8 is filled
with over 150 8 feet of water Mike and

18:24.570 --> 18:29.750
Joeywill be using a remote operated
submersible vehicle other wise known as

18:29.750 --> 18:35.960
an ROV equipped with a Tritech micron
sonar he will use sound waves to detect

18:35.960 --> 18:42.950
and obtain images of any voids or
objects within a range of 250 feet

18:42.950 --> 18:48.590
the ROV also features a high-definition
camera allowing the team to monitor a

18:48.590 --> 18:54.000
live video feedof today's operation
just let me know when you're all clear

18:54.000 --> 18:57.389
there and I can start lowering it in
yeah Roger we're all clear good to put

18:57.389 --> 19:36.110
the ROV down the con Roger
here we go the hunt is on

19:36.110 --> 19:40.010
coming up see that now that is a clear
right angle yeah

19:40.010 --> 19:44.010
is it possible that you're at the side
of a rather large cabin that could be

19:44.010 --> 19:50.760
very few explanations for it other than
a lawyer

19:50.760 --> 19:57.320
we're startingto get returns on the
SONA although at the money pit site Rick

19:57.320 --> 20:02.679
lagina his nephew Alexand Craig tester
along with representatives from dive

20:02.679 --> 20:08.269
techlimited are just beginning a sonar
scan of the HHF just check it my

20:08.269 --> 20:12.130
sentence just adjusting the gain and
stuffthey are eager to obtain more

20:12.130 --> 20:17.210
precise imagery of a large underground
anomaly that was recently identified by

20:17.210 --> 20:22.601
seismic scanning and anomaly the team is
hoping could actually be evidence of a

20:22.601 --> 20:27.730
large underground treasure chamber okay
Joey carry it on down

20:27.730 --> 20:34.169
yeah Roger using motorized propellers
operated remotely fromthe surface the

20:34.169 --> 20:40.279
sonar equipped ROV descentsthe 50 inch
wide h8 steel case on toward the soil

20:40.279 --> 20:45.100
and possible void below it we're gonna
use every available technology that has

20:45.100 --> 20:49.639
merit to help solve this mystery so
we're gonna run sonar down there if

20:49.639 --> 20:53.149
there's a void if there's a chamber if
there's something we penetrated or push

20:53.149 --> 20:57.799
past we might beable to see it so maybe
I'll have something to explore so once

20:57.799 --> 21:03.100
we get out of the caisson we should see
that change from a hard yellow to softer

21:03.100 --> 21:05.880
return because the clay will be
absorbing the sonar

21:05.880 --> 21:09.570
make if there's a void ora tunnel or
anything down there what do we see we

21:09.570 --> 21:20.450
would just see an open with no return
there's no pity or now it's just block

21:20.450 --> 21:25.970
water so that's what I expected so we're
down 20 meters now much so we're just

21:25.970 --> 21:33.299
passing 60 feet just like to see it oh
yeah

21:33.299 --> 21:39.539
Marty without nearly 38 meters okay okay
we're coming up to 42 meters but come on

21:39.539 --> 21:48.289
on to 50 meters or 165 and that's gonna
be the bottom I can't let's get a scan

21:48.289 --> 21:54.050
right in here okay Joe coming to a stop
just doing a scan router that might I'm

21:54.050 --> 21:58.440
waiting for a micto PAB the aha moment
I'm waiting for him to say there there's

21:58.440 --> 22:03.750
what you're looking for trying to get a
dead center you know it's amazing does

22:03.750 --> 22:06.770
he watch that little sweep go around
you're looking for the big cavity to

22:06.770 --> 22:14.049
show everytime every sweep did you see
that see the square corner it doesn't go

22:14.049 --> 22:19.029
round it looks like it comes and then
just at an angle zero there let me go go

22:19.029 --> 22:26.509
back to two meters with salt on earth I
think so see that now that is a clear

22:26.509 --> 22:34.899
right angle you can definitely see
that's a 90-degree angle can you go

22:34.899 --> 22:38.269
a head and drive it forward that'd be
going straight upright on this screen

22:38.269 --> 22:43.240
we're gonna go a head a bit more and
there's your angle unless you're moving

22:43.240 --> 22:49.539
I'm not moving but that's a dandy there
a right angle could the team actually

22:49.539 --> 22:54.779
have found evidence of aman-made
chamber located some 170 feet deep

22:54.779 --> 22:58.960
underground is it possible that you're
at the side ofa rather large cavity

22:58.960 --> 23:04.090
that could be angular features in nature
are always interesting to look at

23:04.090 --> 23:09.180
because angles usually are a reflective
of human intervention some sort of human

23:09.180 --> 23:13.470
construct so there's a hope that it's an
association with some sort of room or

23:13.470 --> 23:18.279
cavity void
if a large boy really does exist some

23:18.279 --> 23:24.320
170 feet deep underground has the Oak
Island team finally located the bottom

23:24.320 --> 23:28.440
of the original moneypit
and if zone could they be just moments

23:28.440 --> 23:31.590
away from locating the legendary
Chappell vault

23:31.590 --> 23:44.620
Oh doesn't seem right that's videos
dropping off that'snot good

23:44.620 --> 23:52.590
okay so I'll comfor talso depth on on my
videos flickering for some reason

23:52.590 --> 24:00.759
yeah videos Flickrand really bad yeah
we've lost sonar as wel lno more power

24:00.759 --> 24:03.149
that is odd everything started shutting
down

24:03.149 --> 24:09.549
we got acomms lost along well power
down kind of looks like that's some kind

24:09.549 --> 24:14.130
of massive brain failure going on to me
it's justs preading all over the place

24:14.130 --> 24:20.309
heyJoel just powered down thank you
yeah we don'tI don't want to leave

24:20.309 --> 24:23.960
power on just incase it is getting
water it your chances of survival on

24:23.960 --> 24:28.159
this pull it and take a look at it yeah
yes and if you think it can be fixed

24:28.159 --> 24:31.010
real quick let's go right back to where
we want to be and see if we get some

24:31.010 --> 24:36.059
data
hey Joel just pull a rope okay

24:36.059 --> 24:39.300
disappointing it's not the correct
verbage really I mean it's more than

24:39.300 --> 24:43.059
disappointing we're on the verge of
possibly coming to an understanding of

24:43.059 --> 24:50.250
what's below AJ and then the equipment
fails and not under difficult conditions

24:50.250 --> 24:55.491
designed for many times the depth which
one of those it's Oak Island

24:55.491 --> 25:00.029
explanations the island hides its
secrets well isn'tit

25:00.029 --> 25:05.890
we were just poised above it yeah said
Shakti nope

25:05.890 --> 25:11.129
although the ROV was built to with stand
depths of up to 1,000 feet it would not

25:11.129 --> 25:16.610
be the first time that equipment
suddenly and inexplicably failed on Oak

25:16.610 --> 25:22.320
Island for the past two centuries
treasure hunters have reported bizarre

25:22.320 --> 25:28.071
equipment failures and usually at times
when they believed they were close to a

25:28.071 --> 25:33.670
major break through
could this be another such occasion I

25:33.670 --> 25:38.399
think we all are somewhat used to or
gather than throwingus a curveball mr.

25:38.399 --> 25:42.279
Blankenship encountered that during his
years here

25:42.279 --> 25:46.490
Dunfieldran into the same thing it's
almost like it's a living breathing

25:46.490 --> 25:52.210
entityand it just refuses to give up
its secrets okay you're on surface here

25:52.210 --> 25:55.330
gonna pull you out again let's see if
there's anywater and this hopefully

25:55.330 --> 26:03.789
there isn't
did it flood yeah

26:03.789 --> 26:11.620
if it is let it yeah that's not good
yeah that does it for us that

26:11.620 --> 26:18.760
what are you thinking big because it is
Mike and Joey's assessment that the ROV

26:18.760 --> 26:23.250
has suffered serious water damagethe
Oak Island teamwill be forced to

26:23.250 --> 26:29.519
suspend today's sonar operation
never the less evidence that a large

26:29.519 --> 26:35.220
possibly man-made boy exists at a depth
ofone hundred and seventy feet has made

26:35.220 --> 26:42.370
them more eager than ever to hammer grab
the contents of a cheDanny it's happy

26:42.370 --> 26:47.259
timefor you you get to do something we
would like to hammer grab yet today and

26:47.259 --> 26:54.370
we're running out of time so I
appreciate it unbelievable

26:54.370 --> 26:59.269
coming up what indicates that it could
be a script is the rhythm of the carbon

26:59.269 --> 27:12.610
so there is a set of scripts in the high
medieval period referred to asto cross experience

27:12.610 --> 27:14.269
as the
nt limited

27:14.269 --> 27:21.470
continues to hammer grab the h8 shaft
brothers Rick and Marty lagina gather

27:21.470 --> 27:25.690
with members of their team in the war
room today should be one of those very

27:25.690 --> 27:31.870
interesting days we have dr. cope are
again they are eager to hear a report on

27:31.870 --> 27:36.019
the mysterious stone carvings the team
found in the money pit area

27:36.019 --> 27:41.190
two weeks ago hey how are you doing
thank you

27:41.190 --> 27:47.460
good thanks dr. Leela copeour he's an
associate professor of English at the

27:47.460 --> 27:51.809
Catholic University of America in
Washington DCI've got everybody here

27:51.809 --> 27:57.890
again she is considered an expert on
Norse mythology and medieval stone

27:57.890 --> 28:03.789
carvings including rune ology the study
of rome's we're all really excited to

28:03.789 --> 28:07.720
hear ifyou were able to reach any
conclusions regarding thethe may be

28:07.720 --> 28:11.289
inscribed stone that we've been talking
about well I spent some time with this

28:11.289 --> 28:15.529
stone it's immensely interesting for a
variety of reasons you floated the idea

28:15.529 --> 28:20.629
that it might be runes right because
everyone's are characterized by these

28:20.629 --> 28:27.360
nice straight lines the problem however
is the way that this stone is inscribed

28:27.360 --> 28:34.600
if you're in size ruins you ear don't
have any guide lines above or below the

28:34.600 --> 28:38.460
charactersor if you do as in
Scandinavia then you have it on both

28:38.460 --> 28:43.629
sides sothe characters are between two
lines not just one side

28:43.629 --> 28:50.149
so that tome speaks against the fact
that these can be rooms I could not

28:50.149 --> 28:55.279
identify a single character that would
be ruining so my conclusion would be

28:55.279 --> 29:03.090
that these are not relevantthe reason
why you all think that it's an inscribed

29:03.090 --> 29:07.470
stone I think because it has that
straight line in the middle and the

29:07.470 --> 29:15.259
inside characters that seem very regular
what indicates that could be a scriptis

29:15.259 --> 29:21.070
the the rhythm of the carving the next
question is what script are we dealing

29:21.070 --> 29:25.669
withso I started thinking okay what
could it look like if it was scripts o

29:25.669 --> 29:29.980
there is a set of script in the high
medieval period referred to as the

29:29.980 --> 29:33.700
Gothic scriptand the rhythm of these
characters or these markings on the

29:33.700 --> 29:39.419
stone reminds me of this particular
gothic script it looks a little bit like

29:39.419 --> 29:48.610
an inscription inwhat school - text -
Alice rotunda they are widely used from

29:48.610 --> 29:53.730
twelve to fifteen century and they have
a numberof different versions gothic

29:53.730 --> 30:00.299
scrip tfirst developed in Western Europe
in the 12th century AD

30:00.299 --> 30:04.420
gothic script was a popular writing
style used in the Middle Ages for the

30:04.420 --> 30:10.580
very difficult task of reproducing books
by hand known more commonly a sblack

30:10.580 --> 30:15.230
letter the script was also widely
utilized for stone and metal

30:15.230 --> 30:21.220
inscriptionssuch as those found on
graves and in churches

30:21.220 --> 30:25.790
could this stone found near the money
pit really be inscribed with medieval

30:25.790 --> 30:30.860
gothic writing it was interesting that
she mentions the possibility of it being

30:30.860 --> 30:35.190
gothic script because gothic script is
somewhere between the 12th and 15th

30:35.190 --> 30:40.850
century well that's an aha moment
because the trois is believed to be from

30:40.850 --> 30:46.121
the thirteen hundreds when she explained
the dates associated with Gothic script

30:46.121 --> 30:50.501
I think we all went wow the other
interesting feature is that it's like a

30:50.501 --> 30:57.860
littleround thing in the middle like a
raised circle it would be a typical to

30:57.860 --> 31:03.960
see that as a marker to mark our
different segments of an instruction you

31:03.960 --> 31:07.529
don't use bulbs or the little round
things for not normally the markings on

31:07.529 --> 31:12.450
it could be decorative so it would be
worth looking whether there is anything

31:12.450 --> 31:18.340
where you could use an architectural
stone in architecture you do decorate

31:18.340 --> 31:24.679
stones oftenand for that you often use
rhythmic patterns just because they look

31:24.679 --> 31:29.049
pretty so my conclusion would be then
it's probably architectural and the

31:29.049 --> 31:33.970
markings on it are decorative the
interesting thing about that is there's

31:33.970 --> 31:38.619
somebody onthe island
has the urge to create something that

31:38.619 --> 31:43.350
looks like something else because it's
relevant to them for what ever reason

31:43.350 --> 31:49.580
okay the result I was hoping for was
that she would say oh this is such in

31:49.580 --> 31:54.169
such language from such-and-such people
that was used at such-and-suchtime and

31:54.169 --> 32:00.549
here's what it says but what she did say
however is that it was carved so at

32:00.549 --> 32:05.820
least we know we have a mysterious stone
with strange carvings on it well I mean

32:05.820 --> 32:09.049
it's it's good info we know a lot more
than when we started very gratified to

32:09.049 --> 32:12.389
hear that at least you found it
intriguing as well that's great oh yes I

32:12.389 --> 32:15.840
mean we're gonna follow these clues and
if we find something else I think you're

32:15.840 --> 32:20.700
gonna see it yeah please please get back
to me I'm really interested all right

32:20.700 --> 32:24.820
take care
thank you bye although for now the exact

32:24.820 --> 32:30.899
nature of the stone carvings remains a
mystery Rick Marty and the team remain

32:30.899 --> 32:35.499
convinced that they could offer an
important clue in solving the Oak Island

32:35.499 --> 32:38.750
mystery
I believe those are characters on that

32:38.750 --> 32:42.830
stoneI think we all think there's
something on the stone yeah this is a

32:42.830 --> 32:47.500
strange inscription I still think
there's information there begs further

32:47.500 --> 32:51.429
research right yes let's get back to
work

32:51.429 --> 33:12.179
sounds good to me all right
coming up it's a coinit's no design

33:12.179 --> 33:14.789
I've

33:14.789 --> 33:20.240
another day begins on Oak Island and as
the excavation of the mysterious slipway

33:20.240 --> 33:27.540
continues at Smith's Cove Rick lagina
metal detection expert Gary Drayton and

33:27.540 --> 33:33.509
dan henskee arrive at the money pit dig
site what I'd like to do is go down

33:33.509 --> 33:40.471
there and see if we can't find me the
other part of that stone okay after

33:40.471 --> 33:44.499
learning that the large stone fragment
they recently found in the area could be

33:44.499 --> 33:49.539
inscribed with medieval writing they are
hoping that other pieces of the

33:49.539 --> 33:55.379
mysterious artifact can be found nearby
you're always looking for Marty always

33:55.379 --> 33:57.799
refers to as more data let's go have a
look

33:57.799 --> 34:03.070
this stone is certainly broken and it
appears that there's more characters

34:03.070 --> 34:07.149
that continue across the length of it so
that would be a significant find find

34:07.149 --> 34:14.100
the other pieceI'd say it's like that
on that Rick stone I thinkit was that

34:14.100 --> 34:19.320
type of stone well you don't
it should be fairly apparent Gary yeah

34:19.320 --> 34:28.460
make it make that song that I love to
hear I love a little search around okay

34:28.460 --> 34:33.860
as Rick and Dan searched the area by eye
Gary scours it with this metal detector

34:33.860 --> 34:39.120
although it won't alert him to the
presence of anything made of stone he is

34:39.120 --> 34:42.630
hoping there might be equally
interesting metal objects in the

34:42.630 --> 34:49.330
vicinity yeah that one looks a similar
to the Roomster with a mouse on

34:49.330 --> 35:07.370
- wrong that's -way repeatable have no
idea what it is it's not that deep six

35:07.370 --> 35:14.940
inches and it's just in excellent just
here

35:14.940 --> 35:31.930
or something so going for a minute
I did it's a coin

35:31.930 --> 35:42.570
please be old and that is unusual
there's like a webbing kind of design to

35:42.570 --> 35:50.900
it yeah there is it's no design I've
ever seen look at the top I'm going to

35:50.900 --> 35:59.150
token a token dating back to the first
century BC bronze or copper tokens were

35:59.150 --> 36:03.850
used in the Roman Empire as an
alternative form of currency tog old and

36:03.850 --> 36:09.880
silver coins the useof tokens was also
common among merchants selling and

36:09.880 --> 36:16.240
buying goods in the Americas from the
17th to early 19th centuries

36:16.240 --> 36:25.280
could this coin Mike object found on lot
16 be an ancient token zone just how old

36:25.280 --> 36:30.050
could it beand could it be connected to
the carved stone that the team also

36:30.050 --> 37:19.250
found in this area okay thank you but
wow that sounds interesting

37:19.250 --> 37:23.440
alright give mea call if we find any
okay

37:23.440 --> 37:33.830
discoveryit's not wood what is concret
REE

37:33.830 --> 37:54.792
what in the world is that I mean it's
certainly unrecorded yeah how deep does

37:54.792 --> 38:02.660
it go today we don't know yet I've been
ever surprised a bit abit you want you

38:02.660 --> 38:10.390
wanna reconfigure that a concrete wall
buried some eight feetbeneath Smith's

38:10.390 --> 38:17.520
Cove there's a way to date concrete
the Romans had concrete yeah the Romans

38:17.520 --> 38:25.580
had concrete that would set under water
this could easily be incredibly old

38:25.580 --> 38:31.280
known for such engineering marvels as
the Pantheon and the Colosseum the

38:31.280 --> 38:36.740
ancient Romans were the first to develop
and use poured concrete as far back as

38:36.740 --> 38:43.390
the 3rd century BC by mixing volcanic
ash along with other rocks and minerals

38:43.390 --> 38:48.180
they created a unique kind of pipe
drawing cement which actually hardened

38:48.180 --> 38:53.570
when exposed to seawater it has long
been theorized that thiskind of

38:53.570 --> 38:57.730
advanced engineering would have been
required to build the intricate system

38:57.730 --> 39:01.770
of booby-trapped flood tunnels on Oak
Island

39:01.770 --> 39:06.300
there's absolutely no record of anything
like this

39:06.300 --> 39:11.930
it's smits coves so of course your mind goes
to flying like something we absolutely

39:11.930 --> 39:16.340
are certain is original I mean it'd be
very interesting if this goes through

39:16.340 --> 39:21.810
this structure or underneathit then
obviously who ever built this knew about

39:21.810 --> 39:26.020
this right let's stop short then this
could be something entirely separate

39:26.020 --> 39:32.480
from that camera yeah
it's very strange in order to pour this

39:32.480 --> 39:37.260
this is under walk exactly that's then
this is three feet below grade and then

39:37.260 --> 39:43.230
an additional three feet under water I
mean this was not an easy build

39:43.230 --> 39:48.190
if you'd asked me if what five things we
might find in Smith's Cove 10 things 28

39:48.190 --> 39:52.470
this would not be one concrete wall was
one of them yeah I said the only thing

39:52.470 --> 39:58.980
there to surprise me more if it was hot
pink honest

39:58.980 --> 40:03.130
Coughlin's would be on top of this so
it's no wonder tha the didn't see this

40:03.130 --> 40:08.860
sir find it yeah yeah and there's no
mention in 1850 or 1864 sixty six of

40:08.860 --> 40:13.080
them using concrete we need to dig
inside yep

40:13.080 --> 40:19.750
you know respecting that integrity again
if whatever's here goes that way then we

40:19.750 --> 40:23.050
do have to stop okay you've gotta call
the engineers give them the specs of

40:23.050 --> 40:28.860
what we're doing okay and get it okay
but I think one one pull through here is

40:28.860 --> 40:31.100
fine yeah obviously a pull through here
is fine

40:31.100 --> 40:37.120
yeahbut any closer it's a all stop
situation okay so let's kind of just

40:37.120 --> 40:41.290
scrape this and see what see what
happens

40:41.290 --> 40:46.160
for Rick Marty and their team the
discoveries they are making suggest that

40:46.160 --> 40:52.200
the origins of the Oak Island mystery
may date much earlier and be much more

40:52.200 --> 40:56.280
profound than the treasure hunters
before them ever suspected

40:56.280 --> 41:03.140
but as they continue to dig deeper both
at the money pit

41:03.140 --> 41:08.470
and at Smith's calls what will they
uncover a vault filled with sacred

41:08.470 --> 41:13.220
treasure ancient waterways and
architecture dating back to Roman times

41:13.220 --> 41:21.600
or will it be evidence of something even
more astounding something so forbidden

41:21.600 --> 41:28.620
that it had to be protected
by a deadly curse next time on the curse

41:28.620 --> 41:32.960
up O'Connor
now it's time to see what's in that this

41:32.960 --> 41:37.700
is part of the chaplain all we know
there are significant clues in HH

41:37.700 --> 41:40.920
Charles what's this
yeah looks like parchment to me

41:40.920 --> 41:46.400
under the red to that color was used in
really old books if you were in charge

41:46.400 --> 41:49.740
where do you look
I would look at interest there's now

41:49.740 --> 41:51.170
underwater because I think they're
Israel

41:51.170 --> 41:57.000
yeah we found something oh man the hell
could this be  Subtitle by Diego Moraes
