NETFLIX PRESENTS

03:34.120 --> 03:35.560
<i>Priming the detonator now.</i>

03:38.760 --> 03:40.560
<i>Don't trigger until we are safe.</i>

05:55.640 --> 05:56.640
Hot chocolate?

06:04.920 --> 06:06.120
I'm Naomi.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.320
I work for the police.

06:11.960 --> 06:13.000
What's your name?

06:14.600 --> 06:17.200
You don't need to be afraid.
You're safe here.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.080
Anything else you want?
Cookies, maybe?

06:28.120 --> 06:30.320
Can you tell me what happened on board?

06:30.960 --> 06:32.960
Were you traveling with your parents?

06:36.440 --> 06:40.760
<i>Worldwide, the markets are showing</i>
<i>an 8% surge,</i>

06:40.840 --> 06:44.120
<i>driven mainly by airline stocks.</i>

06:44.200 --> 06:46.560
<i>Analysts predict</i>
<i>a strong course correction</i>

06:46.640 --> 06:50.560
<i>which means the markets might face</i>
<i>some instability for some time.</i>

06:50.640 --> 06:52.640
<i>In spite of the market's current high,</i>

06:52.720 --> 06:55.960
<i>it's still a risky moment</i>
<i>in terms of investment op</i>p<i>ortunities.</i>

06:56.040 --> 06:58.640
<i>This volatility is also confirmed</i>

06:58.720 --> 07:02.760
<i>by the fact</i>
<i>that gold is at a new seven-year high. </i>

07:02.840 --> 07:06.360
<i>The situation resembles earlier periods</i>
<i>of an overheated market…</i>

07:53.600 --> 07:54.440
Hello.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.240
Hello.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.080
Where's your mom?

08:00.160 --> 08:03.400
She'll be here soon.
She told me to check our bags.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.760
Wait, I'll help you.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.960
Thank you.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.640
What have you got in there? Rocks?

08:46.080 --> 08:48.720
-Hello, little man.
-I've checked the luggage.

08:48.800 --> 08:50.040
No problems.

08:50.760 --> 08:51.680
<i>You're awesome.</i>

08:52.640 --> 08:54.480
<i>-Elias?</i>
-Yes?

08:57.760 --> 08:59.040
I love you.

09:00.720 --> 09:02.080
See you in a bit, Mom.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.080
There you are! Sweetheart.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.120
There you are. You did great.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.240
Is this yours?

10:29.320 --> 10:30.160
Yes.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.480
I have a prescription.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.960
Mommy will be right back. You stay here.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.400
-Okay, I promise.
-Good.

12:12.000 --> 12:12.840
Excuse me?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.640
It's daytime in America now.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.240
Look, we are here.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.400
It's night here.
And New York is over there, to the west.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.880
It's day there now. We're flying this way.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.040
But the earth turns this way.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.640
So night will be five hours longer for us.

12:30.720 --> 12:33.320
We'll land at night,
even though it'll be day here.

12:34.160 --> 12:37.280
Wow.
That was a real scientific presentation.

12:42.320 --> 12:45.080
-Isn't your mother back yet?
-She's taking her medicine.

12:45.800 --> 12:49.800
But there's a doctor in America,
Dr. Brown, who can help her.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.560
He'll kill off her bad blood
and plant new bone marrow.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.000
So she'll start making new, healthy blood.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.120
I'm a scientist, too. A physicist.
I'm going to a convention in America.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.240
-I'm Elias.
-I'm Farid.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.720
-Do you have siblings?
-No, no siblings.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.520
-Do you have a favorite team?
-Dragons.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.160
Cool.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.920
Hey, Mom. This is Farid.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.880
He helped me with the luggage.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.040
-Would you like to sit down?
-No, thanks.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.120
It's a bright boy you got there.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.440
He sure is.

13:31.960 --> 13:32.880
Come on, honey.

14:01.760 --> 14:02.680
Here, Mom.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.560
Rainer, there's no need to be rude.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.440
Those are our compartments.

14:30.520 --> 14:31.720
Just sit, dear.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.720
-Are you comfortable?
-Yes, I'm fine.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.720
So, would you like some coffee, gentlemen?

15:26.800 --> 15:29.360
-Oh yeah. I'll take--
-Black, two sugars?

15:29.440 --> 15:32.640
-You're the best, Julia.
-And one with lots of milk?

15:34.000 --> 15:34.840
Bastian?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.360
Yes, right.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.640
Robert, the guy in 1A is all yours.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.680
The new guy fits all the clichés.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.720
-Are you jealous?
-Excuse me?

16:01.800 --> 16:04.640
Well, now you're not the only one
after the copilot.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.000
<i>The safety instructions </i>

16:16.080 --> 16:18.920
<i>have been placed in the seat pocket</i>
<i>in front of you.</i>

16:19.480 --> 16:21.160
<i>We are third in line for takeoff</i>

16:21.240 --> 16:23.960
<i>and are expected to be in the air</i>
<i>in a few minutes.</i>

16:24.040 --> 16:26.600
<i>Please fasten your seatbelts</i>
<i>and secure all baggage</i>

16:26.680 --> 16:28.760
<i>under your seat</i>
<i>or in the compartments above.</i>

16:28.840 --> 16:32.160
<i>Ensure that your seats and tray tables</i>
<i>are in the upright position.</i>

20:15.800 --> 20:16.680
So?

20:17.720 --> 20:18.680
No idea.

20:21.440 --> 20:22.920
What are we going to do?

20:29.040 --> 20:31.320
You wait in the car. I'll get help.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.160
Someone's freaking out.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.280
Everything is fine, honey.
Go back to sleep.

22:15.320 --> 22:17.080
Hey, Michael. Do you need help?

22:17.160 --> 22:18.520
No worries. I've got it.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.600
Answer! Where is he?

25:43.000 --> 25:45.560
It's gonna be all right, sweetheart.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.640
We're turning around.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.000
No.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.680
Everything is fine, sweetie.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.360
They are just avoiding a storm.
Don't worry.

28:22.880 --> 28:24.080
Look ahead.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.080
Elias, cut it out.

28:53.920 --> 28:55.240
Put it back.

28:56.440 --> 29:00.440
-We can hide down here.
-Stop it right now. Put it back!

29:04.440 --> 29:05.640
Peace be upon you.

29:15.080 --> 29:16.720
Elias, I said stop it!

29:18.760 --> 29:19.680
Move!

29:42.040 --> 29:43.480
That was just my son.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.640
-No!
-Get up.

32:00.600 --> 32:01.880
It's all right.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.800
It's all right.

34:16.840 --> 34:17.920
It's all right.

37:58.280 --> 37:59.960
"Rejoice

38:01.560 --> 38:04.800
community of…

38:06.360 --> 38:07.720
Muslims."

38:18.040 --> 38:20.200
"Rejoice, community of Muslims."

38:20.280 --> 38:24.000
"In our blessed martyrdom,
Allah the Almighty has allowed us

38:24.080 --> 38:27.280
to carry out an attack on godless Europe."

38:28.280 --> 38:31.520
I have been forced to read this message.

38:31.600 --> 38:35.960
We have nothing to do with the hijacking.
Please help us. <i>Allah akbar</i>.

38:43.880 --> 38:46.080
Read it how it's written.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.080
Already?

46:48.520 --> 46:51.320
You can't do that.

46:54.040 --> 46:55.480
Go back to your seat!

46:59.560 --> 47:02.040
-I thought you were dead.
-It's fine, honey.

47:02.120 --> 47:04.600
We have to turn the plane around.
It'll be fine.

47:04.680 --> 47:05.880
Go!

47:09.840 --> 47:11.040
Don't look.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.000
Don't look.

47:17.120 --> 47:17.960
Fuck.

48:17.120 --> 48:20.080
-What are you doing?
-I study aerospace engineering.

48:20.160 --> 48:21.960
Sit down! They'll kill all of us.

48:30.160 --> 48:31.360
Brother, why New York?

48:31.440 --> 48:33.880
-I'm going to a convention.
-Me too.

48:42.720 --> 48:44.520
Nonsense, they're not terrorists.

48:44.600 --> 48:48.080
Why? Because they don't have beards
and pray towards Mecca?

48:57.920 --> 49:00.040
They want to crash the stock market.

49:00.120 --> 49:03.360
Like the bombing a few years ago,
the soccer club.

49:20.320 --> 49:22.680
I've spent a few hours
in a flight simulator, but I…

49:44.560 --> 49:46.400
It will be all right. I promise.

49:51.880 --> 49:53.360
Did you drink blood?

49:55.240 --> 49:57.080
You have to take your medicine.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.560
Hey, everything okay in there?

50:03.800 --> 50:05.040
That wasn't me.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.560
They've got the autopilot on.

50:23.920 --> 50:24.760
Don't.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.200
Let them jump first.

51:31.560 --> 51:33.600
-Turn the plane around.
-What?

51:33.680 --> 51:35.400
I said turn the plane around!

51:37.040 --> 51:38.880
But we're way closer to Europe!

51:43.480 --> 51:44.640
Shit!

51:54.840 --> 51:55.840
Turn around!

51:55.920 --> 51:57.960
Now!

52:27.880 --> 52:30.080
Fuck!

56:25.080 --> 56:27.600
Open the door.<i> </i>Elias!

57:24.400 --> 57:25.480
Can you hear me?

57:26.600 --> 57:27.480
Listen.

57:28.400 --> 57:32.480
You're right. Don't open the door.
No matter what, you're safe in there.

57:37.880 --> 57:39.360
We'll make it. I promise.

58:16.840 --> 58:18.640
Here. It's all right. Okay?

59:42.920 --> 59:46.640
Your baby has been crying
for two hours. Everything all right?

59:47.560 --> 59:48.600
I'm here.

1:02:20.960 --> 1:02:23.040
I was hoping you'd come back.

1:02:27.560 --> 1:02:29.760
You killed my son. Do you know that?

1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:33.440
He bit me.

1:02:34.240 --> 1:02:36.120
He had no control over it.

1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:40.240
But you do.

1:02:40.320 --> 1:02:41.600
No one does.

1:02:41.680 --> 1:02:44.040
The evil is too strong.

1:02:49.200 --> 1:02:50.840
We are all cursed.

1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:54.800
We bring nothing but suffering
to this world.

1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:36.920
No! No, stay here!

1:03:50.040 --> 1:03:51.520
Come back in. They'll be back!

1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:06.320
-Go back.
-I won't leave you alone.

1:04:07.360 --> 1:04:09.080
Come! Hurry up!

1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:11.280
Help me!

1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:31.320
Wait!

1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:37.760
Hide. Get in there.

1:05:46.040 --> 1:05:48.960
There's no deity but God.
Muhammad is the messenger of God.

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.280
Leave her alone!

1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:20.880
I have to kill your mama. She's evil.

1:07:20.960 --> 1:07:22.200
You're the evil one!

1:07:23.600 --> 1:07:24.920
Don't move!

1:07:26.640 --> 1:07:27.760
Can you do that?

1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:30.640
Don't move!

1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:32.640
Can you shoot someone?

1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:49.880
Come on!

1:12:55.480 --> 1:12:56.960
<i>We are cursed.</i>

1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:01.280
<i>We cannot allow this evil</i>
<i>to keep spreading.</i>

1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:16.400
This evil cannot keep spreading!<i> </i>

1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:17.800
We have to stop it.

1:13:26.920 --> 1:13:29.120
You have the evil within.

1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:31.760
And you cannot

1:13:32.720 --> 1:13:33.920
control it.

1:15:56.200 --> 1:15:57.560
Everything okay?

1:15:58.240 --> 1:15:59.760
-I want to see my mom!
-No.

1:16:00.360 --> 1:16:02.480
Elias, stay here.

1:16:58.200 --> 1:16:59.720
Out of the way!

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:32.240
-Mom!
-Elias, stay here!

1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:15.840
Let's get out!

1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:23.240
We need help!

1:18:24.520 --> 1:18:25.560
Help!

1:18:34.320 --> 1:18:35.480
Did he bite you?

1:18:36.200 --> 1:18:37.320
Did he bite you?

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:57.120
Ingelore?

1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:00.560
Ingelore?

1:19:03.080 --> 1:19:05.920
Ingelore, where are you?
I'm looking for my wife.

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:07.080
Give it to me.

1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:09.760
Out of the way!

1:19:15.720 --> 1:19:16.560
Let me through!

1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:18.640
Let me through!

1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:22.120
-I need to find my wife.
-Where is she?

1:19:22.200 --> 1:19:23.560
The monster got her!

1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:25.160
She's not a monster!

1:20:19.360 --> 1:20:20.640
Hey, not through here.

1:20:22.040 --> 1:20:24.480
Hey, kid! What's wrong with your mother?

1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:26.760
-She doesn't have leukemia.
-I never said that.

1:20:26.840 --> 1:20:30.160
-Don't hurt her, please.
-I won't, I promise. What's her name?

1:20:30.240 --> 1:20:32.840
-Nadja.
-Okay. You stay here. Watch him!

1:20:32.920 --> 1:20:34.280
Sure.

1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:38.680
Mama, watch out! They want to kill you!

1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:41.400
Mama! Can you hear me?

1:20:41.960 --> 1:20:43.320
They want to kill you!

1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:57.200
Nadja? Can you hear me?

1:20:58.680 --> 1:21:01.680
Elias sent me. We don't want to hurt you!

1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:02.880
Ingelore!

1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:03.800
Ingelore!

1:21:04.800 --> 1:21:06.760
Ingelore. What happened to you?

1:21:12.360 --> 1:21:13.640
Oh no, this can't be.

1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:28.080
No!

1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:35.760
Give it to me! Come on!

1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:39.440
-Wait! Hold on.
-You killed my wife!

1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:54.480
Hey! Stay here! Stop him!

1:22:12.680 --> 1:22:13.840
Don't do it!

1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:26.800
No!

1:22:27.520 --> 1:22:28.800
Don't shoot!

1:22:53.680 --> 1:22:55.400
We can't let them come up.

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:02.400
You have to help her!

1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:32.560
He bit me.

1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:34.960
I can't feel my fingers!

1:23:51.520 --> 1:23:52.440
Shit.

1:24:13.880 --> 1:24:15.000
Stay here.

1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:19.520
Oh my God. Elias! Get some help, quick!

1:24:20.520 --> 1:24:21.360
Quick!

1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:38.680
Help me!

1:24:39.520 --> 1:24:42.200
We need heavy people
to weigh down the hatch!

1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:28.960
No!

1:25:29.600 --> 1:25:31.640
Don't bite him!

1:25:32.760 --> 1:25:35.120
Stop, go away! Don't drink his blood!

1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:41.040
Elias, get back. He's dangerous.

1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:43.320
He wants to be healed, just like you!

1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:47.240
-No! Don't!
-Calm down!

1:25:47.920 --> 1:25:48.920
I'm right here.

1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:06.560
My hand got caught in the cargo hold door.

1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:09.120
Your mom helped me.

1:26:10.280 --> 1:26:11.120
Come.

1:26:11.200 --> 1:26:13.640
Elias. Come.

1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:43.080
Turn the plane around.

1:26:45.360 --> 1:26:48.240
-Do it!
-I have to check our route. We're too low.

1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:52.040
-Mom.
-What's going on?

1:26:52.120 --> 1:26:56.120
She wants us to fly to New York.
But we're too low and short on fuel.

1:26:56.200 --> 1:26:59.800
We have to divert to the nearest airport,
or we'll crash into the sea.

1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:02.320
-Turn that plane!
-We can't make it to New York.

1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:03.680
Do you understand?

1:27:23.320 --> 1:27:24.920
It's dark down there.

1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:27.320
Come on, let's go!

1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:47.560
They wanted to blow down the door.

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:49.880
Watch out, it's on!

1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:51.560
Not anymore.

1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:56.560
It's gonna be fine. We'll wait until dark
and catch the next plane to New York.

1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:00.640
Mom, look how far we've come.

1:28:01.240 --> 1:28:04.480
Mom! Please, we'll can do it.

1:32:24.400 --> 1:32:27.240
Dr. Brown will make sure
we get the Cytarabine.

1:32:27.320 --> 1:32:30.080
We'll have enough time
to plan the next flight.

1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:43.440
Shit.

1:32:45.680 --> 1:32:46.760
Fuck!

1:32:48.080 --> 1:32:50.800
-What's wrong?
-I don't know. Something's wrong.

1:32:54.640 --> 1:32:56.920
-Bastian!
-What's going on?

1:32:57.000 --> 1:32:58.080
Get down.

1:32:58.680 --> 1:33:00.000
Wait, I'll help you.

1:33:01.960 --> 1:33:03.120
Hey, what are you doing?

1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:05.760
We can help them!
We can hide them down there!

1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:10.360
If we open the door,
we'll never get it shut again.

1:33:25.400 --> 1:33:26.920
We can't land.

1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:30.360
What do you mean?
You want to crash the plane, or what?

1:33:30.440 --> 1:33:34.520
They'll hide in the cargo bay
until dark and then get out, all of them.

1:33:34.600 --> 1:33:36.240
We have to inform officials.

1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:38.920
And tell them what?
We have vampires on board?

1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:40.600
No, we have to…

1:33:40.680 --> 1:33:42.880
We have to land and then jump.

1:33:43.720 --> 1:33:46.960
Here. If we attach this to the fuel tank,

1:33:47.040 --> 1:33:50.160
it'll blow up the whole plane.
How do we get there?

1:33:55.160 --> 1:33:57.080
-That's the fuel tank.
-Fuck. Shit.

1:33:57.800 --> 1:33:58.760
What?

1:33:59.280 --> 1:34:01.600
The detonator has no timer.
Is there a remote?

1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:02.760
-Yeah.
-Where is it?

1:34:02.840 --> 1:34:03.680
Curtiz had it.

1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:06.280
-Where is that arsehole?
-In the rear cargo hold.

1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:10.080
Okay.

1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:13.440
-Does this lead to the back?
-Yes.

1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:15.400
Man!

1:34:19.080 --> 1:34:20.880
Shit! It's way too narrow.

1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:24.520
Can we detonate manually?

1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:27.640
Yes. But then we'll blow up too.

1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:31.120
You land the plane.

1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:34.600
And as soon as you're out,

1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:35.720
I'll blow it up.

1:34:35.800 --> 1:34:36.880
No, Mama!

1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:39.640
-Yes, Elias.
-We can get you out of here.

1:34:39.720 --> 1:34:43.320
-You can hide in here.
-Elias, we have no other choice.

1:34:44.200 --> 1:34:47.120
-I can fit. I can get the remote.
-Elias, it's over!

1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:48.520
Do you hear me?

1:34:53.600 --> 1:34:55.200
Forgive me, please.

1:34:55.280 --> 1:34:56.480
I can get past with this.

1:34:58.040 --> 1:34:59.320
Elias--

1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:03.600
Stay here, Elias! Shit!

1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:06.760
Fuck.

1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:46.200
No! That's suicide!

1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:49.960
He'll make it. Look.

1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:34.600
That's the remote control.

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:37.400
Elias, can you hear me?

1:36:37.480 --> 1:36:39.760
<i>The cell phone is the remote control.</i>

1:36:41.520 --> 1:36:43.840
Be careful. Don't press the big button.

1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:47.480
Elias, come back.
Elias, you hear me? Come back.

1:36:47.960 --> 1:36:48.960
<i>Elias, run!</i>

1:36:54.120 --> 1:36:55.040
No!

1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:02.480
Shit!

1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:19.840
How hard is it to land the plane?

1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:22.920
What? Why? We'll make it.

1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:26.360
I entered the coordinates.
We fly to the destination automatically.

1:37:26.880 --> 1:37:27.840
And the landing?

1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:32.040
You have to stay in the air corridor
and brake. No problem at all.

1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:35.680
-Can you handle it?
-What?

1:37:35.760 --> 1:37:39.080
With contact to ground control,
anyone can, even with one hand.

1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:42.520
You'll have to look after my son.

1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:45.080
What do you mean?

1:37:45.840 --> 1:37:47.160
Please, just promise me.

1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:52.120
I promise.

1:37:54.200 --> 1:37:56.600
Hey, what are you doing? No!

1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.720
Mama! Help me!

1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:27.840
Go away! No!

1:39:49.400 --> 1:39:50.280
No!

1:40:09.360 --> 1:40:10.640
Come on!

1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:13.240
Come on!

1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:15.200
Come on!

1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:18.960
Come and get me!

1:41:26.440 --> 1:41:27.560
No. Elias.

1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:32.280
Mama!

1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:34.360
Talk to me, please.

1:41:41.600 --> 1:41:42.600
Shit!

1:41:51.440 --> 1:41:52.760
Autopilot.

1:41:57.760 --> 1:42:00.400
No! Go away!

1:42:27.440 --> 1:42:28.680
Stay with me.

1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:35.800
Where's Farid?

1:44:35.880 --> 1:44:37.320
You mean Farid al Adwa?

1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:40.480
He's still on the plane.
The police have him under control.

1:44:40.560 --> 1:44:41.880
You have to get him out.

1:44:41.960 --> 1:44:45.200
No matter what Farid told you,
he's one of the bad guys.

1:44:45.280 --> 1:44:48.400
No! You have to get Farid out
to save him from the vampires.

1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:51.080
-The plane is full of them.
-Calm down. What happened?

1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:54.080
You have to get Farid out of there
before sunset.

1:44:54.160 --> 1:44:55.520
We need your help.

1:44:55.600 --> 1:44:58.560
Can you tell me
how many kidnappers there are?

1:44:58.640 --> 1:44:59.480
They're all dead!

1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:01.720
-Dead? How?
-They are all monsters!

1:45:01.800 --> 1:45:05.400
You have to get Farid out of there
before the sun goes down!

1:45:06.360 --> 1:45:09.120
-No! Stop it!
-Calm down.

1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:11.280
Let me go!

1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:14.680
Let go of me!

1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:16.360
Let…

1:45:17.960 --> 1:45:18.800
You have to

1:45:19.480 --> 1:45:20.320
save

1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:21.920
Farid.

1:48:09.640 --> 1:48:10.720
No. Please! Don't!

1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:43.000
You have to get Farid out!
Where's my teddy?

1:48:43.640 --> 1:48:44.840
Where's my teddy?

1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:45.960
My bear!

1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:21.000
Elias! I'm here!

1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:22.920
-I'm here! Elias!
-Farid!

1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:35.400
No!
