WEBVTT

00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.610 --> 00:12.711
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.713 --> 00:14.980
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.982 --> 00:17.716
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.718 --> 00:20.052
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:20.054 --> 00:22.688
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.690 --> 00:25.557
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.559 --> 00:29.528
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.530 --> 00:33.565
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.567 --> 00:36.568
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.570 --> 00:38.237
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.239 --> 00:40.672
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.674 --> 00:43.075
¶ Sofia ¶

00:43.077 --> 00:45.577
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.579 --> 00:51.750
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:04.398 --> 01:07.032
Oh, here we are, Sofia.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.568
The first ever
Conjurers Conference.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.703
Have you ever seen
such a magical sight?

01:11.705 --> 01:14.773
It looks like every sorcerer
from every kingdom is here.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.676
And already ahead
of us in line.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.912
Oh, hush, Wormy.
It will be worth the wait.

01:19.914 --> 01:22.047
They've all come to
Hexley Hall

01:22.049 --> 01:24.950
to share new spells,
pow-wow over potions,

01:24.952 --> 01:26.718
and hobnob
over hexes.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.588
I'm excited to be
your apprentice again.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.757
As you should be.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.125
You shall get the honor
of helping me

01:33.127 --> 01:35.794
demonstrate my latest
feats of sorcery.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.596
The world will finally see
what makes

01:37.598 --> 01:41.433
Cedric the Sensational
so, well, sensational.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.701
Watch it,
fumble feet.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.604
Oh, you watch it,
grumpy wizard.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.207
( bell tolls )

01:54.949 --> 01:58.550
Oh, do you think Grimtrix
will be here?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.452
Yes, no doubt,
but not to worry, Sofia.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.588
He wouldn't dare go after
your amulet

02:02.590 --> 02:04.690
with all these
wizards around.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.662
Wow.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.632
Such mesmerizing magic.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.469
Wand tune-ups.

02:17.471 --> 02:20.272
Get your wand
in tip-top shape.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.840
Shrinking lessons
over here.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.675
Come over here
if you wanna get shrunk.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.257
What are you painting?

02:38.259 --> 02:39.825
This, my dear girl,

02:39.827 --> 02:42.828
is the land where
all magic comes from.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.297
The Mystic Isles.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.167
Wow. I've read about
the Mystic Isles in stories,

02:48.169 --> 02:49.601
but I didn't know
they were real.

02:49.603 --> 02:52.037
Oh, very real.

02:52.039 --> 02:56.175
It's a land filled with the most
mystical, magical creatures.

02:56.177 --> 02:58.677
Oh. Amazing.

02:58.679 --> 03:02.014
If only the Mystic Isles
weren't so hard to get to,

03:02.016 --> 03:03.282
perhaps we'd go there
one day.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.185
Jun, I didn't know
you'd be here.

03:06.187 --> 03:09.354
Hi, Sofia. I'm helping
Wu-Chang with his demonstration.

03:09.356 --> 03:13.058
To some, a paper kite
is child's play.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.695
But add a little magic,
and it's everyone's play.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.797
( laughing )

03:23.370 --> 03:24.903
Oh, my.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.345
What was that?

03:33.347 --> 03:35.147
And what is this?

03:35.149 --> 03:39.551
An invitation for
Cedric the Sensational.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.153
Let's see what it's for.

03:41.155 --> 03:44.356
"Please join us in
the Enchanted Portrait Parlor

03:44.358 --> 03:47.859
for a secret meeting of
the greatest sorcerers
in the world."

03:47.861 --> 03:50.028
Did you hear that, Wormy?

03:50.030 --> 03:53.832
Someone considers me
one of the greatest
sorcerers in the world.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.902
Oh, I'm flattered,
I'm flabbergasted, I'm--

03:56.904 --> 03:58.904
Wasting time.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.273
We must get to
this very important
meeting right away.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.342
Yes, of course.
You're right. Let's go.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.612
Pardon me. Make way.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.513
Very important sorcerer
coming through.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.787
Jun, have you seen
Mr. Cedric?

04:15.789 --> 04:18.123
We're supposed to demonstrate
his new spells.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.825
Oh, over there.
There he is.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.965
( gasps )
That's Grimtrix' weasel.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.300
Excuse me.

04:45.953 --> 04:49.321
Cedric, old chum.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.889
You made it.

04:50.891 --> 04:53.792
Grimtrix?
You invited me here?

04:53.794 --> 04:56.928
Is that Morgana?
What is this about?

04:56.930 --> 04:59.831
Have a seat
and find out.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.000
The last time I saw you,

05:02.002 --> 05:05.003
you declared yourself
No More Mr. Nice Sorcerer.

05:05.005 --> 05:08.440
That's still true,
so if it's nice you want,

05:08.442 --> 05:10.642
you should leave now.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.312
But a powerful sorcerer
such as yourself

05:13.314 --> 05:17.249
may want to stick around
and hear my plan first.

05:17.251 --> 05:18.917
Powerful, you say?

05:18.919 --> 05:22.988
And I have a way for you
to gain even more power.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.090
So have a seat
won't you?

05:25.092 --> 05:27.159
Let us begin.

05:27.161 --> 05:30.862
Friends, wizards,
and sorcerers,
I ask you,

05:30.864 --> 05:33.699
aren't you tired of
useless royals

05:33.701 --> 05:35.100
always telling us
what to do?

05:35.102 --> 05:37.936
How many times
have we been forced

05:37.938 --> 05:41.873
to use our magic
to entertain at silly banquets?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.608
More times
than I can count.

05:43.610 --> 05:46.311
How often has our magic
gotten a king

05:46.313 --> 05:48.013
out of some pickle,

05:48.015 --> 05:50.382
only for him to take
all the credit?

05:50.384 --> 05:52.384
Yeah. I'm tired of
being overlooked.

05:52.386 --> 05:56.021
We wizards are
wiser than royals.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.056
We are magical,
for Merlin's sake.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.225
We should rule
the kingdoms.

06:00.227 --> 06:03.161
What exactly
are you proposing, Grimtrix?

06:03.163 --> 06:06.331
That you join me in
a special group

06:06.333 --> 06:09.067
I shall call
the Order of the Wand.

06:09.069 --> 06:12.070
And together, we shall
take over

06:12.072 --> 06:14.906
all of the kingdoms.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.541
All of them?

06:16.543 --> 06:18.877
Exactly how are we
supposed to do that?

06:18.879 --> 06:21.713
With these Medusa stones.

06:21.715 --> 06:24.883
WOMAN: The legendary
Medusa stones?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.818
I didn't think
they existed.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.086
MAN: What do they do?

06:28.088 --> 06:31.923
Once you put
a Medusa stone on your wand,

06:31.925 --> 06:34.760
you can cast
an unbreakable spell

06:34.762 --> 06:37.496
that will freeze anyone
in place,

06:37.498 --> 06:40.365
and make them
still as stone.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.767
And then?

06:41.769 --> 06:44.703
And then,
with no one to stop you,

06:44.705 --> 06:47.939
their kingdoms will be
yours for the taking.

06:47.941 --> 06:50.175
Fantastic plan, Grimtrix.

06:50.177 --> 06:53.912
But how can you be sure
these stones will work?

06:53.914 --> 06:57.816
He can't, which is why
I want no part of this plan.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.119
Go ahead, friends.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.288
Try and break the spell.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.625
<i> Animata momenta!</i>

07:07.528 --> 07:09.628
<i> Animata momenta!</i>

07:09.630 --> 07:11.062
<i> Animata momenta!</i>

07:11.064 --> 07:12.531
<i> Moovius groovius!</i>

07:12.533 --> 07:14.599
Hm. Potent indeed.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.968
Once we take over
our kingdoms,

07:16.970 --> 07:21.540
the Order of the Wand
will control the world!

07:21.542 --> 07:22.607
ALL: Yeah!

07:22.609 --> 07:24.142
( gasps )
No!

07:24.144 --> 07:25.811
- Hear, hear!
- The world!

07:25.813 --> 07:30.315
No king, queen,
prince, princess or jester

07:30.317 --> 07:33.118
will tell us
what to do!

07:33.120 --> 07:37.055
So if you really want
to show the world

07:37.057 --> 07:39.558
how great you are,
gather round.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.426
Your Medusa stone awaits.

07:41.428 --> 07:43.829
Mr. Cedric.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.564
Sofia?

07:45.566 --> 07:47.065
Quick.
Over here.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.968
I can't believe what
Grimtrix is doing.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.236
We have to stop him.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.838
Stop him? Well, um...

07:52.840 --> 07:54.439
And why did he think
you would be part of

07:54.441 --> 07:56.141
such an awful plan?

07:56.143 --> 07:59.144
Oh, I haven't
the foggiest idea.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.579
Oh, just
tell her, Cedric.

08:00.581 --> 08:01.646
Tell me what?

08:01.648 --> 08:04.449
That I intend to stall
Grimtrix

08:04.451 --> 08:06.017
and his evil friends

08:06.019 --> 08:07.986
while you fetch
all the good sorcerers

08:07.988 --> 08:09.321
to stop him.

08:09.323 --> 08:12.190
Oh. Oh! That is a great idea.

08:12.192 --> 08:15.093
Yes, and make sure you get
as many as you can.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.295
Take your time.
I can hold them all.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.831
You're the best,
Mr. Cedric.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.233
Yes, I am.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.004
You cannot let
that goody-goody princess

08:26.006 --> 08:28.206
ruin a perfectly
wicked plan.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.041
I'm not ruining
anything, Wormy.

08:30.043 --> 08:33.011
I only said all those things
to get Sofia to leave.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.113
Then you're going through
with the plan?

08:35.115 --> 08:37.516
Yes. Probably.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.384
Oh, I just don't know.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.186
What is there
not to know, Cedric?

08:41.188 --> 08:43.121
All these years,

08:43.123 --> 08:45.290
I've yearned to take over
Enchancia,

08:45.292 --> 08:50.195
but something seems...
different now.

08:50.197 --> 08:55.567
¶ When I was growing up
and they all made fun of me ¶

08:55.569 --> 09:01.039
¶ I vowed that I would show them
just how evil I could be ¶

09:01.041 --> 09:07.012
¶ But now the day has come
and the kingdom can be mine ¶

09:07.014 --> 09:10.882
¶ So why am I so gloomy ¶

09:10.884 --> 09:17.822
¶ When I should be
feeling fine ¶

09:17.824 --> 09:21.760
¶ My evil dreams
were my friends ¶

09:21.762 --> 09:23.728
¶ When I was all alone ¶

09:23.730 --> 09:27.098
¶ My evil schemes
made me feel ¶

09:27.100 --> 09:29.668
¶ Like I had a home ¶

09:29.670 --> 09:33.204
¶ But now it seems
that I've changed ¶

09:33.206 --> 09:35.273
¶ I don't know what to do ¶

09:35.275 --> 09:39.077
¶ My evil dreams
could come true ¶

09:39.079 --> 09:45.250
¶ But I'm not sure
I want them to ¶

09:47.955 --> 09:50.121
¶ The princess may be
nice to you ¶

09:50.123 --> 09:53.525
¶ But what about the rest? ¶

09:53.527 --> 09:56.227
¶ All those who point
and laugh at you ¶

09:56.229 --> 09:58.930
¶ Must see that
you're the best ¶

10:02.202 --> 10:04.903
¶ I've always had
so much to prove ¶

10:04.905 --> 10:07.472
¶ I cannot hesitate ¶

10:07.474 --> 10:10.875
¶ It's time for me
to make my move ¶

10:10.877 --> 10:18.116
¶ And be
Cedric the Great ¶

10:18.118 --> 10:22.153
¶ My evil dreams
are my friends ¶

10:22.155 --> 10:24.589
¶ When I am alone ¶

10:24.591 --> 10:28.126
¶ My evil schemes
make me feel ¶

10:28.128 --> 10:30.128
¶ Like I have a home ¶

10:30.130 --> 10:34.065
¶ My evil dream,
nothing's changed ¶

10:34.067 --> 10:36.234
¶ I know just what to do ¶

10:36.236 --> 10:40.305
¶ My evil dreams
will come true ¶

10:40.307 --> 10:47.345
¶ Not that I'm sure
I want them to ¶

10:47.347 --> 10:51.783
¶ And then at last,
yes, at last ¶

10:51.785 --> 10:57.155
¶ My evil dreams
will finally ¶

10:57.157 --> 11:06.498
¶ Come true ¶

11:21.381 --> 11:23.515
Jun, have you seen
Wu-Chang?

11:23.517 --> 11:26.284
He went to the library with
a bunch of the other sorcerers.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.186
What's going on, Sofia?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.288
I'll explain on the way.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.694
- Wu-Chang?
- Merlin?
What happened?

11:35.696 --> 11:39.397
The magical library Shusher
led us here,

11:39.399 --> 11:40.799
and trapped us inside.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.234
Grimtrix must be
behind this.

11:43.236 --> 11:46.504
We need to get the Shusher
away from the door.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.207
- But how?
- By getting him to shush us.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.343
Be as loud as you can be!

11:52.345 --> 11:54.713
- Like this?!
- Even louder!

11:54.715 --> 11:56.181
Shhh!

11:56.183 --> 11:58.416
Like this loud!

11:58.418 --> 11:59.651
I can be that loud!

11:59.653 --> 12:01.653
See? Hear how loud I am?

12:01.655 --> 12:04.089
Shhh!!

12:06.193 --> 12:07.425
We have to hurry.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.694
Grimtrix is giving
Medusa stones

12:09.696 --> 12:12.664
to all the evil sorcerers
so they can take over
everybody's kingdoms.

12:12.666 --> 12:15.033
There's no need to panic.
All you have to do

12:15.035 --> 12:18.436
is remove the Medusa stones
from the sorcerers' wands,

12:18.438 --> 12:22.107
and any spell cast with them
will be broken.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.579
No! There they go.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.048
It's up to us to stop them.

12:30.050 --> 12:33.418
Wizards, to your
kingdoms!

12:34.855 --> 12:37.455
I guess Mr. Cedric
wasn't able to stall them.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.990
I hope he's okay.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.260
( laughter )

12:42.262 --> 12:46.698
Have fun taking over
Enchancia, Cedric.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.467
Don't you mean
King Cedric?

12:49.469 --> 12:51.069
Oh, of course.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.371
King Cedric.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.712
Mr. Cedric!

13:00.714 --> 13:03.414
- Princess Sofia.
- What are you doing?

13:03.416 --> 13:06.384
It's not what it looks like.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.153
Oh, it's exactly
what it looks like.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.155
He's taking over
your kingdom, princess.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.923
That can't be true.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.292
Tell me that's not true,
Mr. Cedric.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.761
Or you could tell her
about all the times

13:16.763 --> 13:18.963
you tried to steal
her amulet

13:18.965 --> 13:20.965
so you'd have the power
to seize the throne.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.501
From the moment you arrived
at the castle, by the way.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.503
Enough, Wormwood.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.138
It is true, Sofia.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.473
Everything he said is true.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.507
Why?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.943
Because,
my dear princess,

13:31.945 --> 13:35.346
once I am king,
everyone will finally see

13:35.348 --> 13:38.283
what a great sorcerer
I truly am.

13:38.285 --> 13:41.085
I thought you were my friend.

13:41.087 --> 13:44.756
Well, it appears
you were wrong.

13:44.758 --> 13:47.425
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a kingdom to overthrow.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.546
- Can I borrow this?
- It's a free sample.
Take it.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.415
Thanks. Whoa!

14:12.452 --> 14:15.453
There it is, Wormy,
my future castle.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.922
My destiny.

14:28.735 --> 14:31.402
Cedric, did you enjoy
the Conjurers Conference?

14:31.404 --> 14:34.205
More than you can imagine,
my good man.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.573
Zippety zap.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.575
Now take my cloak.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.410
He's put a spell on
the steward. Stop him!

14:39.412 --> 14:41.079
Not likely.

14:42.849 --> 14:45.383
This will be easier
than we thought.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.852
Yes, I should say so.

14:47.854 --> 14:51.089
And now, to the throne room
we go.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.562
Baileywick!

14:57.564 --> 14:58.963
Oh!

15:02.535 --> 15:05.003
I wouldn't get too comfy
in those thrones

15:05.005 --> 15:07.071
if I were you.

15:07.073 --> 15:10.275
They're really not
as comfortable as
you'd think, Cedric.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.510
Oh, that is not
what I mean.

15:12.512 --> 15:16.781
You are looking at the new
king of Enchancia.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.616
( laughing )

15:18.618 --> 15:20.018
That's a good one,
Mr. Cedric.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.519
Oh, king!

15:21.521 --> 15:24.956
I believe the joke
may be on you.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.392
There you are.
Heads up.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.459
Freeze.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.961
Hold that pose.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.496
Stay put.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.466
Can you believe it, Wormy?

15:35.468 --> 15:37.969
Oh, at long, glorious last,

15:37.971 --> 15:41.472
I can seize the throne
and no one can stop me.

15:42.575 --> 15:45.877
Well, don't just
stand there.
Seize.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.915
He really did it.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.550
He froze everyone.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.652
And now for
some redecorating.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.422
The wand. I've got to get
his wand.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.324
Oh, yes, much better.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.128
<i> Pronus-thronius!</i>

16:04.130 --> 16:08.666
Your throne awaits you,
Your Majesty.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.169
All hail me.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.173
Don't do this, Mr. Cedric.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.674
Sofia?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.276
Quick, quick.
Freeze her.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.577
Stop where you are,
princess.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.412
Mr. Cedric, please.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.680
Think about
what you're doing.

16:22.682 --> 16:23.648
Zap her.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.149
Mr. Cedric, please.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.517
I know you don't
want to do this.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.187
This is all I want.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.029
- Got it!
- Cedric, what have
you done?

16:40.166 --> 16:41.833
- Give that back.
- Never.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.680
- Yes!
- No!

16:56.649 --> 16:58.016
Guards, seize him!

17:00.553 --> 17:02.553
Merlin's mushrooms.

17:02.555 --> 17:05.623
You said it, Wormy.

17:07.193 --> 17:08.393
Here's his wand.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.730
Cedric, how could you?

17:12.732 --> 17:15.633
I never thought you were
capable of something like this.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.903
You never thought I was
capable of anything.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.738
No one did.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.408
I remember those days
when your father was the king,

17:23.410 --> 17:25.476
and mine was
the royal sorcerer.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.712
Everything he did
was the greatest thing ever.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.715
But did anyone notice
when I did something right?

17:30.717 --> 17:32.683
No.

17:32.685 --> 17:35.586
They only noticed
when I made a mistake.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.722
And you made
a lot of mistakes.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.391
So did you.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.226
And so did my sister.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.096
But neither of you could do
any wrong in our parents' eyes.

17:45.098 --> 17:49.100
I, on the other hand,
could only do wrong.

17:49.102 --> 17:52.770
All I wanted was for
someone to finally see

17:52.772 --> 17:55.773
that I am a great man.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.743
Then maybe you should've
tried doing something great.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.912
Take him away.

18:06.853 --> 18:08.619
Dad, this is a mistake.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.788
I don't think he really
meant to do this.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.890
He could've zapped me
with that spell.

18:12.892 --> 18:15.593
He was pointing the wand
right at me,

18:15.595 --> 18:17.028
but he didn't do it.

18:17.030 --> 18:20.898
Sofia, you always want
to see the best in people,

18:20.900 --> 18:24.802
but sometimes,
there is no best to see.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.871
( sighs )

18:28.408 --> 18:29.874
Joyous day.

18:29.876 --> 18:32.810
Greylock has Rudistan.

18:32.812 --> 18:37.515
Ooh. And Von Rocha
took Zumaria.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.220
I don't see Cedric.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.088
No surprise there.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.656
Come, Wriggley.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.726
An evil sorcerer's work
is never done.

18:59.072 --> 19:02.140
( playing sad tune )

19:03.476 --> 19:04.976
Hello, Mr. Cedric.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.081
Oh. What are you
doing here?

19:10.083 --> 19:11.916
I'm really mad at you.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.519
You lied to me,
you tried to steal from me,

19:14.521 --> 19:16.087
and the worst thing
you did...

19:16.089 --> 19:17.855
I know, I know.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.658
I tried to take over
the kingdom.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.527
No.
The worst thing you did

19:22.529 --> 19:24.762
was say we weren't friends,

19:24.764 --> 19:26.764
because I know
that's not true.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.533
You helped me save
Royal Prep.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.701
You helped me beat
Princess Ivy.

19:30.703 --> 19:35.039
You even let Morgana catch you
so I could get away.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.475
Only a great sorcerer
could do those things.

19:37.477 --> 19:38.709
And a great friend.

19:38.711 --> 19:43.481
Sofia, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.716
An evil wizard's
attacking the castle! Hurry!

19:45.718 --> 19:47.818
It must be Grimtrix.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.387
I have to go.

19:54.327 --> 19:57.695
Excellent. Grimtrix will
get us out of here.

19:57.697 --> 20:01.299
No, Wormy, we will get
ourselves out of here.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.234
How?

20:03.236 --> 20:04.702
What are you doing?

20:07.574 --> 20:09.373
Get the keys.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.808
All right,
I'll get the keys.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.577
( cawing )

20:14.814 --> 20:17.114
( whistling )

20:21.921 --> 20:24.021
Now that I've frozen
the royal family,

20:24.023 --> 20:26.424
where oh where
is King Cedric?

20:26.426 --> 20:27.858
Grimtrix!

20:27.860 --> 20:30.895
Why, hello,
Princess Sofia.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.864
Lovely to see you again.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.233
Now good-bye.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.502
Grimtrix.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.338
Ah, Cedric,
there you are.

20:40.340 --> 20:43.174
Now all you have to do
is zap the princess,

20:43.176 --> 20:45.943
and the kingdom
is yours.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.946
Greatness awaits
for King Cedric.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.985
Mr. Cedric, no.

20:57.523 --> 21:00.958
The zap's on you,
Grimtrix.

21:05.798 --> 21:09.300
Mr. Cedric, you did it.
Thank you.

21:09.302 --> 21:12.136
Well, that's what
friends are for.

21:12.138 --> 21:14.038
Let's unfreeze
the others.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.841
Get ready.
Grimtrix shall
unfreeze, too.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.815
Guards, seize
that sorcerer.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.488
Not Mr. Cedric.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.723
He saved us.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.626
Why would you do
such a dreadfully noble thing?

21:35.628 --> 21:37.161
Because unlike you,

21:37.163 --> 21:39.997
he's a truly great
sorcerer.

21:46.773 --> 21:50.808
So very, very, very, very, very,
very, very, very sorry.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.177
And it won't happen again.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.946
I appreciate
the apology, Cedric,

21:55.948 --> 21:57.948
but that doesn't
change what you did.

21:57.950 --> 22:00.251
But then he saved us
from Grimtrix.

22:00.253 --> 22:02.353
Yes, and that is why
he's not locked up.

22:02.355 --> 22:05.990
But how can I let him be
the royal sorcerer again?

22:05.992 --> 22:08.793
How are we ever
supposed to trust him?

22:08.795 --> 22:11.028
Dad, when I first
got to the castle,

22:11.030 --> 22:13.464
Amber did some things
that weren't so nice,

22:13.466 --> 22:15.266
but I gave her
a second chance,

22:15.268 --> 22:18.436
and ever since then,
she's been the best sister

22:18.438 --> 22:21.172
- I could hope for.
- Oh, Sofia.

22:21.174 --> 22:24.442
We should give Mr. Cedric
a second chance.

22:24.444 --> 22:28.612
Maybe this time, we could
all be a little nicer to him.

22:28.614 --> 22:29.880
I agree.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.216
From what Cedric told us
about growing up,

22:32.218 --> 22:35.186
it sounds like he could've
used a little more
encouragement.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.888
That is true.

22:37.890 --> 22:40.024
Growing up in the shadow
of a famous father

22:40.026 --> 22:41.792
is no easy thing.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.694
All right, Cedric.

22:43.696 --> 22:46.997
I will reinstate you
as royal sorcerer
on one condition.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.566
Anything, sire.

22:48.568 --> 22:51.869
I want you to remember that,
if it wasn't for Sofia,

22:51.871 --> 22:54.171
you would've been on
the next carriage
out of the kingdom.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.006
Worry not, King Roland.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.508
I shall never forget

22:57.510 --> 22:59.810
all that the princess
has done for me.

22:59.812 --> 23:03.013
I am forever in her debt,
and yours.

23:03.015 --> 23:06.584
Then I believe this
belongs to you.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.886
Thank you,
Your Majesty.

23:08.888 --> 23:12.056
And thank you,
Princess Sofia.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.557
Hey, Mr. Cedric.

23:13.559 --> 23:15.693
Now that you've got
your wand back,

23:15.695 --> 23:16.927
will you put on
a magic show for us?

23:16.929 --> 23:19.163
- James!
- Gladly, my prince.

23:19.165 --> 23:21.766
I have some marvelous
new spells.

23:21.768 --> 23:24.101
But I cannot do a show
without the help

23:24.103 --> 23:26.170
of my trusty apprentice.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.305
That's me.
