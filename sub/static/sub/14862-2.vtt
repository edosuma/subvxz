Previously on Mistresses...

00:03.835 --> 00:06.413
If anyone finds out that you
were sleeping with your patient,

00:06.444 --> 00:07.828
Karen, you could lose your license.

00:07.948 --> 00:09.315
I need a favor big sister.

00:09.316 --> 00:11.802
You always said I could move into
the pool house if need arose...

00:11.825 --> 00:13.647
- All right.
- Thank you, thank you. Thank you.

00:13.671 --> 00:15.587
I knew your husband. We were in love.

00:15.594 --> 00:17.557
And I was pregnant when he died.

00:17.677 --> 00:18.769
Abnormal sperm,

00:18.816 --> 00:21.968
has defects that can affect the
ability to reach and penetrate an egg.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.596
You can stop worrying that having a baby

00:23.597 --> 00:25.200
is gonna prevent you from making partner.

00:25.201 --> 00:27.458
- Stop. Okay?
- You're the one who wanted to talk.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.366
It's ok to let go Savannah.

01:18.672 --> 01:20.007
Really?

01:20.007 --> 01:22.407
What? Thor's girlfriend.

01:22.409 --> 01:24.593
In retrospect though, that
hammer was a bad mistake.

01:24.595 --> 01:27.171
It's very difficult to dance with.

01:27.291 --> 01:30.099
So... The Glass Bottles were playing

01:30.101 --> 01:31.934
at this warehouse thing downtown.

01:31.936 --> 01:33.464
Have I played them for you yet?

01:33.584 --> 01:34.770
Totally genius.

01:34.772 --> 01:36.254
Mmm.

01:36.256 --> 01:38.891
We go, right? And Damien is there.

01:38.893 --> 01:39.925
Do you remember Damien?

01:39.927 --> 01:40.628
No.

01:40.672 --> 01:42.899
No. I have a picture.

01:43.898 --> 01:44.980
Damien.

01:46.766 --> 01:48.233
That is not his face.

01:48.235 --> 01:50.402
But it is his best feature.

01:50.404 --> 01:53.322
You do realize this is
not the guest house, right?

01:53.324 --> 01:56.290
This is my dance space,

01:56.263 --> 01:58.829
and that outside is your dance space.

01:59.497 --> 02:01.296
My dance space had no juice.

02:01.298 --> 02:03.165
I said you could crash here,
but if you're gonna wander

02:03.167 --> 02:05.968
into the kitchen at 6:00 in
the morning, totally drunk...

02:05.970 --> 02:07.669
Whoa. What is wrong with you?

02:07.671 --> 02:09.759
Nothing is wrong with me.

02:09.765 --> 02:11.167
I have to go to work.

02:11.192 --> 02:14.652
And this is not how I want to start my day.

02:14.646 --> 02:16.391
Duly noted. Will not happen again.

02:16.441 --> 02:17.930
Thank you.

02:17.932 --> 02:19.838
Pfft.

02:24.605 --> 02:26.527
Dr. Kim? It's Sam Grey.

02:26.527 --> 02:28.106
Oh, come on.

02:28.108 --> 02:30.492
When you get a chance, would
you mind giving me a call back?

02:30.494 --> 02:31.910
Thanks.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.324
Savi, it's me. I'm sorry
to call you so early,

02:48.518 --> 02:50.326
but, um, do you think you
can meet me at the shop

02:50.357 --> 02:53.131
before work this morning? It's important.

02:54.268 --> 02:56.218
Lucy! Carpool's here!

03:00.506 --> 03:01.673
Ready for your test?

03:01.675 --> 03:03.777
6 times 8 is 48. Ain't that great?

03:03.802 --> 03:05.835
6 times 9 is 54. What a bore. 6 times...

03:05.866 --> 03:08.864
You're ready. Okay. Mwah. Love you.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.048
Karen, hey, it's me.

03:24.381 --> 03:25.813
I need your help.

03:33.727 --> 03:34.894
Hey, Savi.

03:34.896 --> 03:36.712
Do you know what this is about?

03:36.832 --> 03:38.782
I don't, and she's not here yet.

03:39.001 --> 03:42.017
Listen, Sam called me this morning.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.918
Sam who?

03:44.455 --> 03:46.005
Oh, Sam Grey?

03:46.007 --> 03:47.256
What did he want?

03:47.376 --> 03:49.124
I don't know. I didn't pick up.

03:49.126 --> 03:50.475
Good. Don't.

03:50.678 --> 03:52.228
So don't even call him back?

03:52.230 --> 03:53.546
I wouldn't.

03:53.548 --> 03:55.712
I told you they're
investigating Tom's death.

03:56.056 --> 03:57.795
Our firm is taking it seriously,

03:57.814 --> 03:59.453
and I really think you should, too.

03:59.503 --> 04:02.119
I am, but Sam doesn't have
anything to do with that.

04:02.239 --> 04:05.529
Well, I mean, he's the son of
the man you were sleeping with,

04:06.129 --> 04:07.337
who was married,

04:07.387 --> 04:08.407
who was your patient,

04:08.385 --> 04:10.835
to whom you prescribed
lethal doses of morphine.

04:10.878 --> 04:12.793
Stop staying "lethal doses of morphine."

04:12.812 --> 04:14.226
Lethal doses of morphine.

04:14.269 --> 04:15.827
Fine. I won't call him back.

04:16.177 --> 04:17.216
Good.

04:17.336 --> 04:19.368
Hey. You okay?

04:20.250 --> 04:22.365
No, I'm not, actually.

04:22.678 --> 04:24.473
Savi. Karen.

04:24.593 --> 04:25.781
Hi.

04:25.901 --> 04:28.265
Paul had a baby with another woman.

04:28.509 --> 04:29.710
My thing can wait.

04:29.954 --> 04:31.907
And then she tells me
that they were in love

04:31.907 --> 04:33.964
and that she was pregnant when he died.

04:33.966 --> 04:35.636
That's why she kept
calling and hanging up...

04:35.636 --> 04:37.219
Because she wanted to tell me the truth,

04:37.420 --> 04:39.064
but apparently, it's hard to tell someone

04:39.108 --> 04:41.905
over the phone that your
entire marriage was a sham,

04:41.907 --> 04:43.539
so she decided to do it in person,

04:43.659 --> 04:44.989
which would've been a classy move

04:45.051 --> 04:46.647
if she wasn't such a gigantic whore.

04:46.629 --> 04:47.667
I'm confused.

04:47.698 --> 04:50.596
I'm confused, too. How did
she know where you live?

04:52.184 --> 04:53.666
That's what's bothering you about this?

04:53.666 --> 04:54.780
The fact that she knew my address?

04:54.787 --> 04:56.175
Did you ask her how she found out?

04:56.219 --> 04:57.401
It didn't occur to me to ask.

04:57.401 --> 04:58.988
I mean, she showed up with the kid.

04:59.003 --> 04:59.904
She brought the kid?

04:59.922 --> 05:01.718
Oh, yes, she brought the kid.

05:02.006 --> 05:04.208
And after she told me how
she and Paul were in love,

05:04.190 --> 05:06.555
I just knew I was gonna throw up,

05:06.586 --> 05:08.219
so I shut the door in her face,

05:08.226 --> 05:10.153
ran upstairs, and cried
for the next six hours,

05:10.215 --> 05:12.502
which is why I'm so puffy.

05:12.504 --> 05:14.801
Oh, no, sweetie. You're not puffy.

05:14.790 --> 05:17.523
I am.

05:18.537 --> 05:22.410
I'm puffy, and my husband
was a lying sack of ass!

05:22.904 --> 05:26.045
And all I want to do right now
is just punch him in the face,

05:26.045 --> 05:27.327
you know, but I can't. I can't,

05:27.384 --> 05:28.704
because he's dead.

05:29.092 --> 05:31.238
He's a dead, lying sack of ass!

05:31.250 --> 05:33.446
Okay, sweetie, before
we go down this road...

05:33.465 --> 05:36.087
which, by the way, I am
completely prepared to do...

05:36.406 --> 05:37.757
but before we do,

05:38.227 --> 05:41.212
maybe we should actually
find out if this is all true.

05:43.164 --> 05:44.747
What? What are you talking about?

05:44.867 --> 05:46.399
Well, you said the phone calls happened

05:46.424 --> 05:48.758
after you deposited the
life insurance check, rig?

05:48.776 --> 05:50.284
- Yeah. So?
- So maybe

05:50.259 --> 05:52.279
this person hacked into your bank account,

05:52.293 --> 05:54.845
saw you made a recent deposit,
then googled your name,

05:54.845 --> 05:57.673
and that's how she was able to
make up this entire sob story.

05:57.704 --> 06:00.144
Why would anyone go through so much trouble

06:00.182 --> 06:01.638
just to scam someone they don't even know?

06:01.758 --> 06:02.509
- Money.
- Money.

06:06.013 --> 06:08.109
God, what am I gonna do?

06:09.134 --> 06:10.685
You know what? Let me help you.

06:10.717 --> 06:11.486
I can have the firm

06:11.511 --> 06:13.413
do some digging into this Miranda person,

06:13.459 --> 06:15.922
and then we can see exactly
what we're dealing with.

06:23.554 --> 06:24.719
I'll call you later.

06:24.721 --> 06:26.025
Okay.

06:26.369 --> 06:29.122
Wait. You were gonna
tell me something before.

06:29.110 --> 06:30.730
We're both running late. It's cool.

06:31.081 --> 06:32.645
Savi, stop.

06:36.599 --> 06:37.815
What's going on?

06:41.704 --> 06:42.787
I, uh...

06:44.814 --> 06:47.317
I cheated on Harry last night.

06:50.032 --> 06:51.495
You can be horrified.

06:52.585 --> 06:53.798
I'm horrified.

06:55.938 --> 06:57.552
How did it happen?

06:57.602 --> 06:59.604
I... I mean, who?

06:59.724 --> 07:01.669
This guy from work... Dominic.

07:02.387 --> 07:04.340
But it's not about him.

07:04.656 --> 07:05.855
Okay.

07:07.124 --> 07:08.288
What do you mean, "okay"?

07:08.309 --> 07:10.071
Nothing. I... I don't know what happened,

07:10.096 --> 07:11.823
so I don't know how
relevant this person is.

07:11.796 --> 07:14.001
He's not relevant.

07:14.299 --> 07:16.182
I believe you.

07:16.184 --> 07:18.286
Don't worry. I'm gonna tell Harry.

07:18.469 --> 07:19.552
You are?

07:20.545 --> 07:22.237
Yeah, of course. Don't you think I should?

07:22.253 --> 07:24.299
If that's what you wanna do, absolutely,

07:24.330 --> 07:26.144
but maybe take a beat.

07:26.933 --> 07:28.885
My stomach i... is in knots.

07:28.897 --> 07:30.418
I don't think I can wait any longer.

07:30.424 --> 07:32.348
- It's just gonna get worse.
- I know.

07:32.350 --> 07:34.297
I just think it's important
that you understand

07:34.322 --> 07:37.306
why you did what you did before
you talk to Harry about it.

07:39.258 --> 07:40.416
Listen,

07:40.866 --> 07:43.542
I know you want to make
this right, and you will,

07:43.769 --> 07:46.497
but if you don't know for
certain why this happened,

07:46.716 --> 07:49.018
how do you know it won't happen again?

08:08.538 --> 08:10.497
Okay, what are you doing to that egg?

08:10.540 --> 08:11.316
Scrambling it.

08:11.304 --> 08:13.224
No, you're not. Give.

08:13.344 --> 08:16.172
Okay, so Savi isn't the only
control freak in the house.

08:16.197 --> 08:17.742
Good to know.

08:18.981 --> 08:21.159
What is up with the house of sadness?

08:21.340 --> 08:22.041
What?

08:22.066 --> 08:23.780
I just need to know if you
guys are always such bummers

08:23.811 --> 08:26.383
'cause I cannot handle this
level of negative energy.

08:26.614 --> 08:27.996
I'm, like, a super upbeat person.

08:28.009 --> 08:29.986
What are you talking about, Joss?

08:32.282 --> 08:33.740
Did you run into Savi this morning?

08:33.802 --> 08:36.624
I did, and she was as delightful
as you're being right now,

08:36.842 --> 08:39.006
although bitchy looks better on her.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.647
Your sister and I had a bit
of a fight the other night.

08:41.767 --> 08:42.866
Whose fault?

08:42.986 --> 08:43.931
Mostly mine.

08:43.975 --> 08:45.382
Tell me everything.

08:45.407 --> 08:46.371
No.

08:46.491 --> 08:48.148
- Okay. Tell me the important parts.
- No.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.819
Dude, I can't help you if you don't share.

08:49.862 --> 08:50.857
I can accept that, Joss.

08:50.882 --> 08:51.995
Harry, I live here now.

08:51.995 --> 08:53.447
No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

08:53.472 --> 08:55.537
You live there, outside.

08:55.787 --> 08:57.089
It's got its own bathroom and everything.

08:57.107 --> 08:58.209
Mm-hmm.

08:58.384 --> 09:00.229
Point is, I can be an asset.

09:00.349 --> 09:01.856
Nobody knows Savi better than I do,

09:01.843 --> 09:04.227
and nobody has had more
fights with her than I have.

09:04.347 --> 09:05.547
There are secrets to winning.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.999
- No, they are not.
- Mm-hmm.

09:10.950 --> 09:12.522
Okay, what kind of secrets?

09:12.642 --> 09:15.244
The most important thing
is to move really quickly,

09:15.281 --> 09:17.271
because the longer my sister
has to think about something,

09:17.272 --> 09:18.292
the deeper she digs in,

09:18.335 --> 09:20.250
and then what started as a minor issue

09:20.256 --> 09:22.278
is now this monumental situation.

09:22.398 --> 09:23.935
Do you know, one time
she went an entire month

09:23.948 --> 09:25.387
without speaking to me because I borrowed

09:25.406 --> 09:27.283
her Archie Bunker t-shirt without asking?

09:28.327 --> 09:30.511
Obviously, I plan on talking
to her about it, Joss.

09:30.529 --> 09:31.473
Really? When?

09:31.593 --> 09:33.276
You guys are working
completely opposite schedules.

09:33.307 --> 09:34.821
If somebody doesn't go out of
their way to make an effort,

09:34.821 --> 09:37.273
it could be days before
you even see each other.

09:39.483 --> 09:40.777
Ooh.

09:41.978 --> 09:43.612
Josslyn carver.

09:43.953 --> 09:44.857
Hey, Alex. What's up?

09:44.857 --> 09:46.408
Sorry to bug you.

09:46.477 --> 09:47.459
Oh, you're not bugging me.

09:47.522 --> 09:48.971
Right. Well,

09:48.998 --> 09:50.025
I hate to do this again,

09:50.006 --> 09:53.047
but unfortunately, I think
we're gonna have to cancel

09:53.034 --> 09:54.611
the appointment with you this afternoon.

09:54.598 --> 09:56.532
I know you had a few
places lined up, but...

09:56.557 --> 09:58.102
Oh, that's okay. I can reschedule.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.218
Actually, I'm thinking we might
need to pause for a minute.

10:01.338 --> 10:03.189
This whole house-hunting thing...
it's just turning out to be

10:03.208 --> 10:04.860
more stressful than I thought.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.505
Ugh. Is it... it's me.

10:06.555 --> 10:09.107
- I'm overwhelming you guys with too many ideas.
- No. No. No. No. No.

10:09.139 --> 10:10.853
It's not you. You've been great.

10:10.847 --> 10:15.933
It's, um, S... Sally's been in
a worse mood than usual lately,

10:15.964 --> 10:18.029
and I think this might
be adding to her stress.

10:18.149 --> 10:20.131
I just really want to make her feel better.

10:20.138 --> 10:22.121
Is that your job, to
make Sally feel better?

10:22.241 --> 10:23.798
Well, she is my girlfriend.

10:23.918 --> 10:25.293
Yeah, but she's a grownup.

10:25.293 --> 10:27.220
She controls her own
happiness, doesn't she?

10:27.626 --> 10:30.467
I'm... I am really sorry
for wasting your time.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.675
Well, let me buy you lunch. I
cleared my afternoon already.

10:32.744 --> 10:34.922
No. You're just gonna try and convince me

10:34.928 --> 10:36.105
to keep looking for houses.

10:36.225 --> 10:38.169
Yes, but I'll do it over a burrito,

10:38.188 --> 10:40.221
which will make my argument
much more effective.

10:40.227 --> 10:41.477
Thank you.

10:41.885 --> 10:43.868
Come on. I know a killer taco stand.

10:48.885 --> 10:50.036
He's not here.

10:50.643 --> 10:51.549
Do you know where he is?

10:51.582 --> 10:54.347
Breakfast and then a depo.
He should be back around 3:00.

10:55.692 --> 10:57.087
Did you need me to get him on the phone?

10:57.207 --> 10:58.295
No, thank you.

11:00.384 --> 11:01.673
Coffee run. You want?

11:02.343 --> 11:03.701
I'm good. Thanks.

11:04.207 --> 11:04.627
Okay.

11:05.471 --> 11:06.291
Hey, Jacob.

11:06.316 --> 11:07.047
Yeah?

11:07.254 --> 11:08.974
Can I ask you a question?

11:09.031 --> 11:11.233
Well, normally I charge $250 an hour,

11:11.353 --> 11:12.997
- but for you, I'll make an exception.
- Okay.

11:13.341 --> 11:15.037
Hypothetically speaking...

11:16.977 --> 11:17.608
Uh...

11:17.658 --> 11:20.093
Sorry. I thought you
were kidding. Continue.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.395
Hypothetically speaking,

11:23.766 --> 11:26.162
if you knew someone had a crush on you,

11:26.393 --> 11:28.577
but you didn't reciprocate those feelings,

11:28.877 --> 11:29.878
how would you handle it?

11:29.940 --> 11:31.342
Are you trying to tell me something?

11:31.342 --> 11:33.044
'Cause I generally prefer blondes.

11:33.062 --> 11:34.364
No offense. Never mind.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.354
Ah, look, I'm... I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

11:36.535 --> 11:39.444
Um, seriously, what's the question?

11:39.469 --> 11:42.059
How do you handle an unrequited crush?

11:42.059 --> 11:44.149
Say a girl keeps calling you,

11:44.324 --> 11:46.927
but you don't have any interest
in pursuing the relationship.

11:46.990 --> 11:47.872
What would you do?

11:47.891 --> 11:50.642
I would, um, I'd call her back

11:50.662 --> 11:53.239
and be honest about my feelings

11:53.264 --> 11:54.612
to avoid any confusion,

11:54.647 --> 11:57.137
and I'd do it nicely, 'cause
my mom raised me right.

11:57.257 --> 11:59.559
What if calling the person
back could be perceived

11:59.602 --> 12:02.142
as a conflict of interest
in a larger matter?

12:02.955 --> 12:04.720
Is there any way it would be okay

12:04.745 --> 12:07.022
to just not call the person back?

12:07.047 --> 12:08.405
Okay? Yeah.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.470
Mature? No.

12:10.590 --> 12:11.896
And in my experience,

12:11.952 --> 12:13.554
it's... it's best to
deal with things head-on,

12:13.573 --> 12:15.218
instead of burying your head in the sand

12:15.338 --> 12:16.595
and praying it all goes away.

12:16.715 --> 12:18.172
Your mom teach you that, too?

12:18.292 --> 12:19.773
She's a very smart lady.

12:19.786 --> 12:21.099
I'm getting you a coffee anyway.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.307
Okay.

12:31.423 --> 12:32.795
You called me back.

12:32.768 --> 12:33.512
Sam.

12:33.562 --> 12:36.109
Yes. Hello. What can I do for you?

12:36.229 --> 12:38.880
Nothing. Just wanted to
follow up on that coffee idea.

12:38.868 --> 12:39.906
Waiter, chill.

12:39.969 --> 12:42.184
I'm sorry. Can you hold on a second?

12:42.190 --> 12:43.629
Hi.

12:43.749 --> 12:45.944
Sorry. It's just my dog.

12:45.987 --> 12:48.277
If now is a bad time, I can call you later.

12:48.279 --> 12:49.912
No, it's okay. He's fine.

12:49.914 --> 12:51.255
He's actually my dad's dog.

12:51.282 --> 12:54.415
He's still... still getting
used to me walking him.

12:56.019 --> 12:57.285
Oh, that's weird.

12:57.681 --> 12:59.138
What's weird?

12:59.258 --> 13:01.660
My dad. Like I said, we
didn't talk that much,

13:01.653 --> 13:03.449
but whenever he did call me,

13:03.511 --> 13:05.164
it was always when he
was out walking Walter.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.399
We'd have these 10-minute conversations.

13:08.468 --> 13:09.680
Never about much of anything.

13:12.014 --> 13:13.610
I just realized this
won't be happening anymore.

13:15.774 --> 13:17.470
When are you going back to school?

13:17.532 --> 13:18.365
Next week,

13:18.565 --> 13:21.493
which is why I wanted to
get our coffee on the books.

13:21.613 --> 13:23.651
I'm almost outta here,
doc. What do you say?

13:23.676 --> 13:25.128
Ten minutes of your time?

13:25.248 --> 13:26.391
My treat?

13:27.611 --> 13:29.976
First report on our mystery woman.

13:39.223 --> 13:41.481
Her name is Miranda Nickleby.

13:41.601 --> 13:43.072
She's 35 years old,

13:43.097 --> 13:45.975
she's from Rochester, Minnesota.

13:45.994 --> 13:47.120
She's a white girl.

13:48.365 --> 13:50.593
Okay. Good to know.

13:51.020 --> 13:53.583
She moved to Orlando in 2005.

13:53.614 --> 13:56.139
Looks like she bounced
around a few retail jobs.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.400
She's been working reception

13:58.432 --> 14:01.729
at the Coconut Grotto since 2007.

14:03.193 --> 14:03.919
What?

14:04.225 --> 14:06.746
Paul's firm has a
satellite office in Orlando.

14:06.952 --> 14:09.280
It's where most of the
software programmers are based.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.146
He'd go there once, sometimes twice a month

14:12.884 --> 14:15.275
and he always stayed at the Coconut Grotto.

14:16.338 --> 14:17.671
- Oh, that doesn't...
- Paul's...

14:17.708 --> 14:20.104
That doesn't necessarily mean anything.

14:20.497 --> 14:22.613
Right? I mean, if she
was a receptionist there,

14:22.632 --> 14:25.135
this could be how she
fabricated the entire story.

14:25.153 --> 14:26.555
I mean, maybe he knew her.

14:26.567 --> 14:28.870
Or maybe he was living a secret life.

14:33.812 --> 14:36.208
Can I take those home?

14:39.099 --> 14:40.282
They're yours.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.130
I hate that you're going
through this right now.

14:46.193 --> 14:48.195
I don't even know what
I'm going through yet.

14:48.858 --> 14:51.717
To be honest with you, I'm
not sure what I'm hoping for.

14:51.837 --> 14:54.508
I mean, either I'm dealing
with a sleazy con artist

14:54.552 --> 14:55.640
looking to make a buck off

14:55.640 --> 14:57.367
the worst thing that's ever happened to me,

14:57.487 --> 15:00.395
or she's a tramp stamp slut
who's ruined my life forever.

15:00.515 --> 15:03.404
No, but even if that's the
case, it won't be forever.

15:03.693 --> 15:05.356
It already is.

15:05.476 --> 15:07.815
Paul is dead. I mean, if
she's telling the truth,

15:07.821 --> 15:09.285
then all my memories,

15:09.405 --> 15:10.912
my marriage, my daughter's father...

15:10.937 --> 15:12.976
it's all gone, lost forever.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.586
And I... I just don't understand

15:15.623 --> 15:17.920
how anyone can do this to another person.

15:18.220 --> 15:19.822
- Do what?
- Cheat.

15:19.826 --> 15:23.564
Betray the one person
you promised you wouldn't.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.404
Yeah. Maybe we shouldn't go down this road.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.031
And it's not even that it's selfish.

15:28.034 --> 15:30.917
I mean, it is just so damn reckless

15:31.037 --> 15:32.779
to destroy that many lives

15:32.811 --> 15:35.225
because, what... what, you
can't help yourself? Please.

15:35.238 --> 15:37.165
I cheated on Harry last night.

15:39.611 --> 15:41.462
I wanted to tell you, but, uh,

15:41.713 --> 15:44.673
obviously, it didn't seem... appropriate.

15:44.793 --> 15:47.081
You're right. It's not appropriate.

15:47.663 --> 15:49.286
How could you...

15:50.047 --> 15:51.730
- you...
- We don't have to talk about this right now.

15:51.774 --> 15:52.987
I don't want to talk about it at all.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.497
Frankly, I wish you hadn't even told me.

15:56.529 --> 15:57.348
Okay.

15:57.405 --> 15:59.514
You should've kept that to yourself.

15:59.516 --> 16:01.349
Really.

16:56.696 --> 16:58.261
I'm telling you, she hates me.

16:58.305 --> 17:01.001
She doesn't hate you. She's
in a fragile state right now.

17:01.019 --> 17:02.371
I'm in a fragile state!

17:02.415 --> 17:04.191
You don't see me yelling at my friends.

17:04.215 --> 17:05.398
You're yelling at me right now.

17:06.713 --> 17:09.722
Well, that's because
you messed with my head.

17:09.722 --> 17:11.255
I mean, I thought I had it all figured out,

17:11.267 --> 17:12.868
what I was supposed to say to Harry,

17:12.932 --> 17:15.265
and then you... you got me thinking.

17:15.284 --> 17:15.903
I apologize.

17:15.928 --> 17:18.894
I will never ask you to
think about anything again.

17:19.013 --> 17:20.277
No, I'm serious.

17:20.554 --> 17:23.180
The more I think about what happened,

17:23.180 --> 17:26.483
the more I can't believe I did what I did.

17:29.856 --> 17:31.895
It wasn't me, Karen.

17:33.065 --> 17:35.074
It was some other...

17:36.131 --> 17:38.834
like, part of me that
allowed this to happen.

17:40.704 --> 17:44.420
Some deeper part that I...
I don't fully understand...

17:44.790 --> 17:46.411
Do you wanna talk about it?

17:46.442 --> 17:47.196
No.

17:48.306 --> 17:48.975
Yes.

17:49.345 --> 17:51.340
Okay. Let's start with the fight.

17:51.559 --> 17:53.186
What was it about exactly?

17:54.147 --> 17:55.820
I mean, a million things.

17:55.882 --> 17:57.809
Does it matter? I...

17:58.829 --> 18:00.093
Just give me a sec.

18:01.031 --> 18:02.977
Hi. This is Savi.

18:03.421 --> 18:05.711
Oh, okay. Great. Yeah.

18:05.831 --> 18:07.595
Uh, I'll be right in. Okay.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.235
I gotta go. Dominic's back in the office.

18:10.247 --> 18:11.505
Are you sure you're comfortable

18:11.505 --> 18:12.894
having that conversation with him?

18:12.932 --> 18:15.940
No, I am not, but do I have a choice?

18:15.959 --> 18:18.212
I mean, I see the guy every day. Right?

18:18.438 --> 18:20.577
The only thing more moronic

18:20.627 --> 18:23.511
than cheating on your husband
is doing it with a guy from work.

18:23.631 --> 18:24.919
Could've been worse.

18:25.213 --> 18:26.364
Could've been your patient

18:26.364 --> 18:29.173
to whom you prescribed
lethal doses of morphine.

18:31.350 --> 18:32.283
That's funny.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.472
Sick, but funny.

18:34.937 --> 18:36.537
Bye.

18:40.253 --> 18:41.498
Look, I don't want to insult you,

18:41.498 --> 18:43.043
but you're obviously doing something wrong.

18:43.418 --> 18:44.701
I'm not.

18:44.821 --> 18:46.428
I'm an excellent girlfriend.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.167
No. No. No. No. That's
not what I'm talking about.

18:48.287 --> 18:49.431
You should be running things,

18:49.487 --> 18:52.053
and you're all backseat Charlie.
It doesn't make any sense.

18:52.053 --> 18:53.285
Why should I be running things?

18:53.405 --> 18:54.724
Sally brings home the bacon

18:54.780 --> 18:56.820
and she's better at
making decisions than I am.

18:56.995 --> 18:58.384
Yeah, but you're hotter,

18:58.822 --> 19:00.136
and this is coming from the person

19:00.167 --> 19:01.913
who's usually the hot
one in the relationship.

19:04.622 --> 19:06.568
So you have relationships?

19:06.624 --> 19:08.050
Yeah, I have relationships,

19:08.088 --> 19:10.290
for about 24 to 48 hours,

19:10.410 --> 19:11.504
and I always have the power.

19:11.504 --> 19:12.893
Well, maybe you always have the power

19:12.937 --> 19:14.901
because you have no intention of staying.

19:14.914 --> 19:16.215
So if you have nothing to lose,

19:16.221 --> 19:18.067
then you can pretty much
do whatever you want.

19:18.098 --> 19:19.778
You're kinda like a terrorist.

19:22.582 --> 19:24.193
What are you doing tomorrow at noon?

19:24.585 --> 19:25.876
No. Come on.

19:25.870 --> 19:27.601
It's a brand-new house. It's
not even on the market yet.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.536
There's a caravan for realtors
only, but I can get you in.

19:29.542 --> 19:30.839
And how can you do that?

19:30.841 --> 19:32.825
Because I'm a terrorist.

19:55.702 --> 19:57.066
I'm losing it.

20:28.349 --> 20:30.345
Oh. It's you.

20:30.401 --> 20:32.441
Oh. Such a charmer you are.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.721
Are you waiting for my sister?

20:36.714 --> 20:39.292
Uh, yeah, I was, but now I'm gonna be late.

20:39.298 --> 20:42.477
Oh, my God. Harry, you took my advice.

20:42.496 --> 20:44.042
That is so awesome.

20:44.162 --> 20:47.608
How did this suddenly
become about you again?

20:48.047 --> 20:49.342
Sorry.

20:50.311 --> 20:53.340
You want me to text her?
She might be on her way home.

20:53.527 --> 20:56.963
Uh, no. No. No. Don't text her. It'll keep.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.015
- I don't mind, no.
- No. Don't. No. No. Don't. Don't.

20:59.046 --> 21:00.466
Seriously, leave it.

21:21.551 --> 21:22.959
Last night was a mistake.

21:23.928 --> 21:25.411
And hello to you, too.

21:25.424 --> 21:27.237
I just feel like I need
to be clear with you.

21:27.551 --> 21:29.284
I... I didn't realize I
was gonna be out all day.

21:29.404 --> 21:30.911
- I wanted to talk to you about it.
- No.

21:31.618 --> 21:32.938
There's nothing to talk about,

21:32.957 --> 21:35.053
because it will never happen again.

21:35.860 --> 21:37.211
Okay.

21:37.242 --> 21:38.262
Look, I realize

21:38.287 --> 21:41.146
that this kinda thing
probably happens a lot for you,

21:41.171 --> 21:42.341
and that it's no big deal...

21:42.372 --> 21:44.537
Have sex with a colleague in the office?

21:44.550 --> 21:46.789
No, that's a... it's a first for me.

21:46.996 --> 21:49.436
I also don't make it a habit
of sleeping with married women.

21:49.461 --> 21:50.662
Uh, it... it's irrelevant.

21:51.657 --> 21:53.033
It was a mistake.

21:53.327 --> 21:55.366
You said that already.

21:55.486 --> 21:57.279
I'm serious.

21:57.281 --> 21:59.064
Serious.

22:00.216 --> 22:02.006
I love my husband.

22:03.220 --> 22:04.671
I respect that.

22:20.813 --> 22:21.658
Yeah, I never thought

22:21.689 --> 22:23.328
I'd be looking forward
to going back to school,

22:23.359 --> 22:26.775
but I guess it would be
nice to feel normal again.

22:26.825 --> 22:28.821
Structure and routine can be very soothing.

22:28.941 --> 22:30.572
Are you ever not a shrink?

22:34.209 --> 22:36.691
Why don't you normally look
forward to being in school?

22:36.695 --> 22:38.529
Because I am an econ major.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.746
How excited can I get about math?

22:41.433 --> 22:43.691
Plus, my roommate smokes cloves.

22:44.219 --> 22:46.037
God, I don't miss being 20.

22:46.075 --> 22:47.714
Thank you for admitting it sucks.

22:48.021 --> 22:50.072
It doesn't all suck. It just...

22:51.049 --> 22:52.211
a lot of it sucks.

22:55.242 --> 22:57.005
Wait. I know you have to go,

22:57.012 --> 22:58.920
but I wanted to show you something.

22:58.946 --> 23:01.310
It's actually part of
the reason I called you.

23:05.746 --> 23:07.166
Is this from that game?

23:07.203 --> 23:09.431
Ever since you told me
that story about my dad,

23:09.700 --> 23:11.282
I couldn't stop thinking about it.

23:11.333 --> 23:14.067
I always used to make fun of my
mom for hanging onto this junk,

23:14.098 --> 23:17.157
but now I'm just... glad she did.

23:18.891 --> 23:19.936
So basically, I just

23:19.942 --> 23:22.031
wanted to thank you again for everything.

23:22.069 --> 23:23.252
You don't have to.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.697
Please. You helped me.

23:24.728 --> 23:26.724
I don't think you know how much.

23:26.781 --> 23:28.589
I'm glad I could make a difference.

23:32.218 --> 23:33.412
Okay.

23:36.259 --> 23:37.091
Oh!

23:37.117 --> 23:39.153
Oh, my God. I am so sorry.

23:39.184 --> 23:41.374
No, it's okay. Um, here.

23:41.411 --> 23:42.794
No, it's okay. It's okay.

23:42.826 --> 23:44.596
Don't worry. It's... it's okay.

23:45.366 --> 23:46.317
Oh.

23:46.386 --> 23:48.019
Now I'm really gonna be late.

23:48.232 --> 23:50.165
It was so nice to see you again, Sam.

23:50.209 --> 23:51.729
Yeah, you, too.

23:51.849 --> 23:53.569
Good luck with everything.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.821
Okay. Bye.

24:01.334 --> 24:02.085
Okay.

24:03.004 --> 24:03.849
You got it.

24:05.436 --> 24:06.885
Hey.

24:07.773 --> 24:09.255
I need to call you back.

24:09.768 --> 24:11.740
Okay. Thanks.

24:12.127 --> 24:13.003
Hi.

24:13.009 --> 24:14.154
Hi.

24:14.595 --> 24:16.745
Thought I could take you to lunch.

24:17.106 --> 24:18.908
I, uh...

24:20.103 --> 24:22.174
tried to wait up for you last
night, but I... I fell asleep.

24:22.181 --> 24:24.971
Yeah. I should've waited
for you to come home.

24:25.997 --> 24:29.007
Savi, it's not your fault our
schedules are like this. Okay?

24:30.960 --> 24:32.849
I'm really sorry.

24:33.887 --> 24:35.080
For what?

24:35.082 --> 24:37.910
For acting like an ass the other night.

24:38.511 --> 24:40.137
I mean, I handled everything wrong,

24:40.131 --> 24:42.408
and I... I... I hate that we fought.

24:43.879 --> 24:46.012
- Sorry.
- Oh, no. It's... it's fine, mate.

24:46.132 --> 24:47.495
It's Dominic, right?

24:51.546 --> 24:52.576
Yeah.

24:52.638 --> 24:54.352
Yeah. Uh, it's great to see you, man.

24:54.371 --> 24:55.110
Yeah.

24:55.397 --> 24:57.387
Um, Elizabeth grey will be here in five.

24:57.449 --> 24:59.268
Great. Great. I'll be right there.

25:00.015 --> 25:01.185
All right.

25:02.829 --> 25:04.456
Not a good time, huh?

25:04.468 --> 25:06.239
I'm sorry. It's just
kinda crazy around here.

25:07.046 --> 25:08.247
Uh,

25:08.641 --> 25:11.707
I'm really sorry that you...
you drove all the way down here.

25:11.738 --> 25:13.664
And you're right. We do have to talk.

25:13.784 --> 25:16.586
Oh, it's all right. I just...
I mostly wanted to apologize

25:16.706 --> 25:19.997
and tell you that I
spoke to the doctor again.

25:20.353 --> 25:20.940
You did?

25:20.985 --> 25:23.437
Yeah. I called him this morning
just to clarify a few things.

25:23.506 --> 25:26.428
You may have noticed I wasn't
exactly paying attention

25:26.403 --> 25:27.617
when we were in his office.

25:27.737 --> 25:30.038
Well, you were surprised.
I think we both were.

25:30.058 --> 25:33.355
Yeah, well, it turns out it's
not nearly as dire as I thought.

25:33.405 --> 25:35.044
They're not even recommending I.V.F.

25:35.088 --> 25:36.721
Apparently, I've got
enough good swimmers in me

25:36.727 --> 25:38.416
that we can keep trying
the old-fashioned way.

25:38.485 --> 25:40.694
I mean, it might take us a
bit longer than we expected,

25:40.719 --> 25:41.589
but...

25:41.983 --> 25:43.351
I can't do this right now.

25:43.353 --> 25:44.849
No. No. I know. I know. It's okay.

25:44.854 --> 25:46.813
I just... just want you
to know that we're good.

25:46.844 --> 25:48.096
- Okay? We're good.
- Okay.

25:48.139 --> 25:50.216
Hey. Come here. I love you.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.799
This place is enormous.

26:03.631 --> 26:05.889
Are those tiny shrunken heads?

26:06.277 --> 26:08.398
Ooh. They appear to be, yes.

26:09.255 --> 26:10.295
Wow.

26:11.326 --> 26:13.341
Whose house did you say this was again?

26:13.461 --> 26:16.231
Some banker dude who's crazy rich,

26:16.238 --> 26:18.668
but possibly crazy crazy.

26:19.798 --> 26:21.168
Ooh. Let's see. Hmm?

26:22.007 --> 26:24.303
Mm. Yep. Crazy crazy.

26:24.510 --> 26:25.654
Are you allowed to do that?

26:25.717 --> 26:28.013
Technically, I could be
checking the drawer space.

26:28.076 --> 26:31.536
Hello. Crazy and kinky. My kind of guy.

26:31.949 --> 26:33.244
What do you think he uses this for?

26:33.313 --> 26:35.802
I might be wrong, but that looks
like a Japanese bondage rope.

26:35.834 --> 26:36.522
A what?

26:36.534 --> 26:37.804
It's a form of sexual foreplay.

26:37.792 --> 26:39.362
It's actually really, really beautiful

26:39.406 --> 26:40.363
when it's done properly.

26:40.363 --> 26:42.347
Do you know how to do it?

26:42.390 --> 26:45.075
Kind of. It's like...

26:49.393 --> 26:51.939
- turn around.
- My head is literally exploding right now.

26:51.970 --> 26:53.315
How do you know how to do this?

26:57.732 --> 26:59.170
Okay. One.

27:08.981 --> 27:10.564
Something like...

27:10.684 --> 27:11.697
Is that too tight?

27:11.718 --> 27:13.251
Uh, no.

27:27.557 --> 27:29.171
Dale Wilson, at your service.

27:29.291 --> 27:31.779
Hi. Um, my name is April Malloy.

27:31.899 --> 27:34.783
I'm wondering if you, um,
ever remember doing business

27:34.783 --> 27:36.434
with my husband Paul Malloy.

27:36.434 --> 27:39.187
It would've been at least three years ago.

27:39.256 --> 27:40.645
Did he buy a car from me?

27:40.714 --> 27:43.955
Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out.

27:45.213 --> 27:47.109
You know what? I'm so sorry. This...

27:47.134 --> 27:49.236
I'm so sorry to bother
you. This is so silly.

27:49.356 --> 27:51.720
Now hold on there, darling.
If Paul Malloy walked

27:51.770 --> 27:54.548
onto my lot, I can guarantee
you he left with a car.

27:54.668 --> 27:56.712
Let me just look.

27:58.246 --> 28:00.509
Well, there he is. Paul Malloy.

28:00.866 --> 28:02.856
Came in March '09.

28:03.031 --> 28:05.253
Bought an '01 yellow Escape.

28:06.948 --> 28:08.455
Thank you.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.600
Aah!

28:29.643 --> 28:31.298
Ok. Slow down, Mrs. Grey.

28:31.561 --> 28:33.588
This officer walks into my house

28:33.613 --> 28:36.171
and starts asking all
these intrusive questions.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.961
- I thought the firm was handling all of this.
- We are. We are.

28:38.970 --> 28:41.500
The... the man you spoke
to is not a police officer.

28:41.620 --> 28:43.740
His name is...

28:44.021 --> 28:45.173
Anthony Newsome,

28:45.191 --> 28:48.088
and he's an investigator hired
by the life insurance company.

28:48.276 --> 28:50.460
To what end? What do they expect to find?

28:50.503 --> 28:52.625
It's just a routine investigation.

28:52.819 --> 28:55.152
Denying the autopsy raised a red flag,

28:55.127 --> 28:56.997
and if there's any way for them to prove

28:56.998 --> 28:59.563
that your husband didn't die
of completely natural causes,

28:59.602 --> 29:00.833
they don't have to pay the policy.

29:00.821 --> 29:02.535
The man had lung cancer.

29:02.839 --> 29:03.993
I know.

29:04.113 --> 29:07.152
Like I said, it's probably
just a fishing expedition.

29:07.272 --> 29:09.985
He'll make the rounds, he'll
ask some basic questions

29:10.105 --> 29:13.364
centering around your husband's
mental state prior to his death.

29:13.408 --> 29:14.891
To rule out suicide.

29:15.135 --> 29:16.300
Exactly.

29:16.302 --> 29:18.507
And once they get a consensus

29:18.513 --> 29:21.610
from the family and the
doctors, this will all go away.

29:22.305 --> 29:23.691
And what if it doesn't?

29:24.564 --> 29:27.812
Well, if they deny the
claim, we can always sue.

29:28.419 --> 29:30.652
And what would that entail?

29:32.435 --> 29:35.377
Uh, we would offer to exhume the body

29:35.389 --> 29:38.417
so the coroner can confirm that
he did die of natural causes.

29:41.921 --> 29:42.872
Uh...

29:43.698 --> 29:45.475
Mrs. Grey, I'm your lawyer,

29:45.969 --> 29:47.496
which means anything that you tell me

29:47.502 --> 29:49.354
is completely confidential.

29:52.682 --> 29:54.384
Thank you, Mrs. Davis,

29:55.166 --> 29:57.800
but I have absolutely nothing to tell.

29:59.970 --> 30:01.304
Okay, then.

30:01.306 --> 30:05.752
Let's go through the list
of potential witnesses.

30:09.915 --> 30:10.901
Yeah?

30:10.894 --> 30:11.683
Dr. Kim?

30:11.701 --> 30:14.274
There's a man named Anthony
Newsome here to see you.

30:14.599 --> 30:15.869
Does he have an appointment?

30:15.894 --> 30:18.691
He says he's an investigator
from huxley life insurance.

30:18.811 --> 30:21.319
He's here to talk to you about Thomas Grey.

30:31.826 --> 30:33.205
Nice office.

30:34.069 --> 30:35.401
Did you decorate it yourself?

30:35.521 --> 30:36.653
I did.

30:37.060 --> 30:39.180
So how long have you been a therapist?

30:39.300 --> 30:40.644
I'm a psychiatrist.

30:40.688 --> 30:43.860
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't
know there was a difference.

30:44.216 --> 30:46.268
But I get that I insulted you.

30:46.388 --> 30:48.233
You know, back when I
used to work L.A.P.D.,

30:48.220 --> 30:51.017
I used to get pissed off when
someone didn't know my rank.

30:51.373 --> 30:52.994
Am I supposed to be intimidated

30:53.019 --> 30:54.902
by the fact that you were a police officer?

30:55.545 --> 30:57.011
Just making conversation.

30:57.774 --> 31:00.714
So you were Thomas Grey's psychiatrist.

31:00.717 --> 31:02.072
That's correct, Mr. Newsome.

31:02.068 --> 31:03.486
Oh, you can call me Anthony,

31:04.053 --> 31:06.357
but I'm guessing you won't.

31:06.670 --> 31:08.566
So it says here that Thomas Grey

31:08.634 --> 31:09.917
was seeing you for almost three years.

31:09.924 --> 31:11.187
What was he seeing you for?

31:11.307 --> 31:12.960
I'm not sure that's relevant.

31:13.984 --> 31:16.706
Well, it might not be, but I
won't know until you tell me.

31:18.320 --> 31:21.416
He was referred to me by
his, uh, general physician.

31:21.536 --> 31:23.306
He was having trouble sleeping.

31:23.825 --> 31:26.327
Well, three years is a long
time to go without sleep.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.862
He came in initially to
work through his insomnia.

31:30.062 --> 31:31.539
Things evolved from there.

31:31.583 --> 31:33.748
I want to skip to the
important stuff, as I can...

31:33.804 --> 31:35.775
I can tell you're a busy woman.

31:36.038 --> 31:38.597
Uh, how would you describe the mental state

31:38.578 --> 31:40.461
of your patient, Thomas Grey,

31:40.486 --> 31:42.583
in the weeks leading up to his death?

31:43.966 --> 31:46.606
I would say he was accepting
of what was about to come.

31:46.726 --> 31:49.378
Really? Do most people
accept that they're dying?

31:49.372 --> 31:50.560
'Cause I sure as hell wouldn't.

31:50.792 --> 31:52.600
Everyone reacts differently.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.983
So he wasn't suicidal?

31:55.103 --> 31:56.466
In my opinion?

31:56.723 --> 31:58.237
No, he was not.

31:58.357 --> 31:59.976
All righty.

32:01.596 --> 32:02.760
Works for me.

32:03.169 --> 32:05.569
Thanks for your time, Dr. Kim.

32:08.147 --> 32:10.876
Oh, if my bosses need
some type of verification,

32:10.882 --> 32:12.653
you have notes on this stuff, right?

32:12.671 --> 32:13.566
Notes?

32:13.610 --> 32:15.888
Your sessions with Mr. Grey...

32:16.144 --> 32:17.946
if I need them,

32:18.651 --> 32:20.617
which I'm sure I won't.

32:22.626 --> 32:24.052
Have a good day.

32:51.620 --> 32:53.209
I was wondering when you'd come.

32:56.486 --> 32:58.005
Scottie's not here.

32:58.632 --> 33:00.424
He's staying with my sister in San Diego.

33:04.338 --> 33:05.477
What do you want from me?

33:05.796 --> 33:08.198
I've been watching you
for a while now, April.

33:09.463 --> 33:10.695
You got a really nice life.

33:10.695 --> 33:12.666
If you're trying to scare
me, it's not gonna work.

33:12.786 --> 33:14.480
I'm not trying to threaten you. I'm...

33:14.600 --> 33:17.239
- I'm trying to explain...
- What do you want?

33:18.276 --> 33:21.656
I want my son to have
what your daughter has.

33:22.682 --> 33:24.830
I want money.

33:31.329 --> 33:33.337
Do you know if Tanen is still
on the schedule for today?

33:33.358 --> 33:35.758
Not sure. I'll find out.

34:06.672 --> 34:07.288
Hey.

34:07.408 --> 34:08.507
What are you doing here?

34:08.507 --> 34:10.925
Glad I caught you. I wasn't
sure how late you worked.

34:10.927 --> 34:12.159
What do you want, Sam?

34:12.155 --> 34:15.183
Uh, well, I... I felt bad about your skirt.

34:15.234 --> 34:17.192
It looked like it was probably expensive,

34:17.204 --> 34:19.487
and I realized I should've
offered to pay for dry-cleaning,

34:19.487 --> 34:21.934
- but you rushed off so quickly.
- I don't want your money.

34:21.938 --> 34:23.188
Please. I don't mind.

34:23.190 --> 34:25.440
This is completely inappropriate.

34:26.045 --> 34:29.110
I don't want you bothering
me anymore. Do you understand?

34:29.112 --> 34:30.837
You're not to contact me.

34:30.813 --> 34:32.927
You're not to show up
in my place of business!

34:32.927 --> 34:35.067
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You're way overreacting.

34:35.187 --> 34:38.652
I don't want to see you
again, Sam. Do you understand?!

34:41.040 --> 34:42.592
No problem.

34:58.913 --> 35:01.917
Is this, like, a "50 Shades" thing?

35:02.037 --> 35:03.512
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Try not to talk.

35:08.161 --> 35:10.550
Oh. This will just take a sec.

35:10.863 --> 35:12.052
Seriously?

35:12.984 --> 35:14.223
Hey, you. What's up?

35:14.343 --> 35:15.480
So I did it.

35:15.600 --> 35:17.938
I convinced Sally to look
at the beach house again,

35:17.976 --> 35:19.922
- and I think she's gonna go for it.
- Yay, you!

35:19.953 --> 35:22.262
That's fantastic! So you told
her how much you loved it?

35:22.255 --> 35:24.921
I did. And I told her that I thought

35:25.041 --> 35:28.274
she was being very unreasonable
and not taking my opinion

35:28.278 --> 35:29.675
into consideration, and she agreed.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.829
Oh, that is so awesome.
I'm so happy for you.

35:32.949 --> 35:34.132
Thanks. Uh, you know,

35:34.130 --> 35:35.894
thank you for listening to
me ramble on and on today.

35:35.885 --> 35:37.270
I know that that's not your job.

35:37.333 --> 35:38.685
By the way, it's totally my job,

35:38.722 --> 35:40.537
but with you, I don't mind so much.

35:40.712 --> 35:41.932
You're just saying that.

35:41.926 --> 35:43.171
No. Seriously.

35:43.176 --> 35:44.993
You're a cool person, Alex.

35:44.995 --> 35:46.694
Well, thank you. So are you.

35:46.696 --> 35:48.596
Okay, tell me exactly what you said to her.

35:48.608 --> 35:50.014
I want all the details.

35:52.031 --> 35:55.153
I still can't believe Paul
would do something like this.

35:55.716 --> 35:57.336
I honestly thought...

35:59.821 --> 36:01.410
I'm so sorry, April.

36:01.435 --> 36:03.068
I don't know what to say.

36:04.194 --> 36:06.985
I am pretty sure there's
nothing you could say

36:07.035 --> 36:08.666
that'll make me feel any better.

36:09.463 --> 36:12.136
I'm just happy you're here.

36:12.948 --> 36:14.581
Savi couldn't come over?

36:15.739 --> 36:16.946
I didn't call her.

36:17.922 --> 36:20.511
I can't... deal with her right now.

36:21.596 --> 36:22.645
I get it.

36:23.510 --> 36:25.237
Actually, I don't.

36:25.806 --> 36:27.839
Not to draw attention to the obvious,

36:27.858 --> 36:30.992
but if you should be angry
at anyone right now, it's me.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.469
I slept with a married man.

36:32.506 --> 36:33.814
I know, but I'm just

36:33.934 --> 36:36.223
not as angry with you as I am with Savi.

36:36.343 --> 36:39.277
I don't know why. Maybe it's
because we're the married ones.

36:39.327 --> 36:42.068
It's, like, we took the oath together,

36:42.111 --> 36:44.182
and she broke it.

36:46.747 --> 36:50.545
For what it's worth, I still
feel guilty about what I did.

36:50.970 --> 36:52.322
More than that, I'm...

36:52.510 --> 36:54.149
embarrassed.

36:54.269 --> 36:56.464
I risked everything for Tom.

36:56.689 --> 36:58.197
I'm still risking it.

36:58.648 --> 37:01.607
I even lied to a... to
an investigator today.

37:02.771 --> 37:04.122
You what?

37:04.242 --> 37:05.467
It doesn't matter.

37:05.473 --> 37:08.113
The point is, I still...

37:09.565 --> 37:11.410
miss him.

37:14.597 --> 37:16.785
But I feel like I don't have the right,

37:16.985 --> 37:19.262
like it's not my place to grieve.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.788
I have all these feelings,

37:22.790 --> 37:24.205
and nowhere to put them.

37:24.207 --> 37:26.119
It's exactly how I feel.

37:26.169 --> 37:28.047
Right now, all I want to do is

37:28.059 --> 37:30.187
rip every picture of Paul off the wall,

37:30.180 --> 37:32.631
throw his crap on the
lawn, and just light it up.

37:34.151 --> 37:35.851
But I can't.

37:36.524 --> 37:37.870
Because of Lucy?

37:38.539 --> 37:40.028
As much as I hate him for what he did,

37:40.028 --> 37:41.640
she doesn't need to know.

37:42.012 --> 37:44.327
I don't want her to lose her father again.

37:52.353 --> 37:54.387
Hand me that bottle, please.

38:01.776 --> 38:04.310
I'm sorry. I promise not to
steal your food every night.

38:04.379 --> 38:06.037
It's okay. Take what you need.

38:06.157 --> 38:08.928
Ooh. You and Harry
haven't made up yet, huh?

38:09.960 --> 38:11.487
He told me you had a fight.

38:12.363 --> 38:14.634
For the record, you can talk
to me about that kind of stuff.

38:14.684 --> 38:17.669
I know you don't think I'm good
at relationshippy things, but...

38:17.669 --> 38:18.419
I never said that.

38:18.607 --> 38:21.604
Well, I'm not, but I'm a good listener.

38:22.179 --> 38:25.088
Okay, I'm not that either,
but I would be, for you.

38:25.157 --> 38:26.133
I know.

38:26.643 --> 38:28.009
- And thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

38:28.011 --> 38:30.301
You have enough pasta for the both of you?

38:30.730 --> 38:32.146
He doesn't do carbs.

38:32.148 --> 38:33.781
Oh. Of course he doesn't.

38:34.968 --> 38:37.318
No strangers at the
breakfast table, please.

38:37.320 --> 38:40.060
As if I'd let him stay over. Come on.

38:54.786 --> 38:55.545
Hello.

39:02.277 --> 39:03.695
Thought it was time I took a night off.

39:06.444 --> 39:07.896
We need to talk, Harry.

39:07.933 --> 39:09.992
Mmm. Absolutely. Let's talk.

39:10.211 --> 39:11.237
Mmm.

39:13.558 --> 39:15.529
There's something I have to tell you.

39:18.092 --> 39:19.232
Okay.

39:20.727 --> 39:22.060
Uh...

39:26.658 --> 39:28.879
I haven't been honest with you.

39:33.809 --> 39:35.686
I think you were right

39:37.551 --> 39:40.260
when you said that I
didn't really want a baby.

39:41.955 --> 39:45.616
I was looking at my calendar
today, and an alert popped up.

39:46.938 --> 39:48.313
S.W.H.

39:49.013 --> 39:50.534
What's S.W.H.?

39:50.596 --> 39:53.568
Sex... with... Harry.

39:53.962 --> 39:55.733
I mean, do you...

39:56.008 --> 39:58.410
do you realize we've been
scheduling our love life

39:58.454 --> 39:59.549
for the past six months?

39:59.669 --> 40:01.770
Lots of couples do that, Savi.

40:01.827 --> 40:02.922
I know.

40:03.435 --> 40:05.606
I just never thought we
would be one of those couples.

40:05.637 --> 40:07.569
Right. Okay. Well, you know,

40:07.588 --> 40:09.697
sorry for disappointing you again, Savi.

40:09.703 --> 40:11.892
Harry, please don't do this. Please.

40:12.261 --> 40:13.788
'Cause this is how it starts, right?

40:13.819 --> 40:15.708
Someone gets defensive, and then we fight,

40:15.727 --> 40:18.248
and we never actually wind up talking.

40:19.900 --> 40:21.702
We're in a rut.

40:24.117 --> 40:26.383
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

40:26.370 --> 40:27.865
But I don't think it's
the end of the world.

40:27.985 --> 40:28.985
No.

40:29.479 --> 40:30.937
Of course it's not.

40:32.076 --> 40:33.715
It's not the end of the world.

40:33.835 --> 40:37.075
But if I'm being totally
honest with myself,

40:37.263 --> 40:40.585
it all started when we
decided to try to have a baby.

40:40.705 --> 40:42.237
I thought you wanted to have a baby.

40:42.275 --> 40:44.715
Yeah, I thought I wanted
to have a baby, too, Harry.

40:45.292 --> 40:47.136
But the more we kept talking about it,

40:47.160 --> 40:50.127
the more books you brought home,
and the more blogs I read...

40:50.145 --> 40:51.646
Well, I told you not to read the blogs.

40:51.648 --> 40:53.164
They're impossible to avoid.

40:53.906 --> 40:55.044
I don't know.

40:55.833 --> 40:59.280
Harry, kids... they change everything.

40:59.731 --> 41:02.740
And there'll be a lot
less time for you and me.

41:02.742 --> 41:04.968
The thought of losing even more of us...

41:05.028 --> 41:06.778
We wouldn't have to lose us.

41:06.780 --> 41:10.598
It's taken us two full days to
have this conversation, Harry.

41:19.514 --> 41:21.347
I didn't realize you were so unhappy.

41:22.404 --> 41:24.088
I'm not unhappy.

41:24.119 --> 41:25.158
I'm just...

41:25.627 --> 41:29.884
I'm not ready to move on to
this next phase in our lives.

41:31.852 --> 41:33.823
Well, if you're not ready,

41:35.590 --> 41:36.651
we'll wait.

41:36.771 --> 41:38.328
Oh, God.

41:40.449 --> 41:41.587
I'm so sorry.

41:41.556 --> 41:44.165
No, don't be. Come on. Come here.

41:51.504 --> 41:52.950
Is that all of it?

41:56.000 --> 41:57.736
That's all of it.

42:04.406 --> 42:06.377
I love you.

42:06.845 --> 42:07.878
I love you.

42:27.711 --> 42:29.883
Do you need to get that?

42:32.278 --> 42:33.361
No.
