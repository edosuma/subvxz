00:01.230 --> 00:04.620
* Bring me quiet,
bring me into shelter *

00:04.670 --> 00:07.764
( door opens, closes )

00:07.800 --> 00:09.529
* Show me loving

00:09.570 --> 00:11.367
* Show me what you
want from me *

00:11.410 --> 00:15.107
* And 1'” cover you *

00:15.140 --> 00:19.110
* See you stopping,
why you running so afraid? *

00:19.150 --> 00:22.244
Baby, come on.
Eat something.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.689
You'll feel better.

00:27.290 --> 00:28.552
Charley.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.253
Baby, you can talk to me.

00:32.300 --> 00:35.292
Let me help you through this.
What happened at that meeting?

00:37.300 --> 00:39.439
I don't want
to talk about it.

00:42.170 --> 00:44.434
All right.
I understand.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.704
But if you ain't
gonna talk to me,
talk to Micah.

00:48.740 --> 00:50.401
He don't know
what's going on.

00:50.450 --> 00:53.544
I would like
to keep it that way.

00:53.580 --> 00:55.810
Charley,
this about his daddy.

00:55.850 --> 00:58.819
He has a right to know.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.080
He ain't no
little kid no more.

01:04.730 --> 01:09.099
* I've been stable,
running to an open heart... *

01:11.470 --> 01:13.563
Hollywood's coming home
from the rigs today.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.739
I'm gonna go
get my feet done.

01:18.210 --> 01:21.179
You let me know
if you need anything
while I'm out, okay?

01:21.210 --> 01:24.475
* Let me help, boy

01:24.510 --> 01:28.742
* And I breathe heaw
for your love *

01:30.920 --> 01:33.354
* But you're standing *

01:34.620 --> 01:36.759
* You're standing *

01:38.660 --> 01:43.461
* I breathe heavy
for your love, babe... *

01:43.500 --> 01:46.333
( theme music playing )

01:46.370 --> 01:50.329
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the
world turns *

01:50.370 --> 01:53.874
* Dreams never die,
take flight, as the world
turns *

01:53.910 --> 01:56.378
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight *

01:58.410 --> 02:00.378
* Dreams never die

02:05.950 --> 02:09.886
* Keep the colors
in the lines *

02:09.930 --> 02:13.127
* Keep the colors
in the lines, take flight. *

02:37.820 --> 02:41.187
I used to come out here
all the time when
I was your age.

02:42.860 --> 02:45.283
( game beeping )

02:47.330 --> 02:49.821
Hey, why'd you
come back without Dad?

02:54.970 --> 02:56.938
Yeah, he did it,
didn't he?

02:56.970 --> 02:58.403
He raped her.

02:58.440 --> 03:02.570
No, Micah, he didn't.

03:02.610 --> 03:04.942
But it's over
between us now.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.709
It's over.

03:09.450 --> 03:11.441
And I'm sorry.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.711
I'm so sorry
this is happening to us,

03:14.760 --> 03:16.955
to you.

03:16.990 --> 03:19.697
Mom, that's it?

03:19.730 --> 03:21.755
That's all you're
gonna tell me?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.865
Mom, what did he do?

03:29.610 --> 03:31.601
Your father's been...

03:35.510 --> 03:37.842
paying for prostitutes
on the road,

03:37.880 --> 03:39.973
at least the one
we met With yesterday,

03:40.020 --> 03:41.908
for years.

03:46.490 --> 03:48.879
Then I don't want
to see hIm again.

03:54.630 --> 03:56.495
( sighs )

04:03.070 --> 04:06.233
Okay,
so what happens now?

04:07.410 --> 04:09.378
Where do we live?

04:11.050 --> 04:12.517
Mom, is he
going to jail?

04:12.550 --> 04:14.609
No.

04:14.650 --> 04:16.789
He's not going to jail.

04:18.520 --> 04:20.659
He is a free man.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.620
It's all arranged.
We'll stay here.

04:24.660 --> 04:26.525
At least until the end
of the harvest season.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.028
Yeah, when is that?

04:29.060 --> 04:30.823
Fall.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.261
So, you mean
I'm taking my SATs here?

04:40.110 --> 04:42.544
Going to school here?

04:46.580 --> 04:49.686
I'm stuck here
for the next six months.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.807
Ralph Angel:
Hey, Charley,
checking if you're back.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.400
Got a fertilizer delivery
coming in at 10:00.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.544
You need to sign
for it.

05:16.580 --> 05:17.842
Okay?

05:21.150 --> 05:23.448
Here we are.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.813
Scoot that over.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.589
Eat your food.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.991
What we gonna do
today, Pops?

05:36.030 --> 05:37.998
- Work.
- But it's Saturday.

05:38.030 --> 05:39.861
Blue, farmers work
every day.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.437
Then I don't
want to be a farmer.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.006
( chuckles )

05:48.610 --> 05:51.602
- That you and me?
- No, me and Mommy.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.741
When do I get to see
Mommy again?

06:02.760 --> 06:04.387
( knocking )

06:08.630 --> 06:10.495
Now, eat your food.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.132
Hey!

06:15.170 --> 06:17.764
Man, when you said
you had a farm,

06:17.810 --> 06:19.471
you weren't kidding.

06:19.510 --> 06:21.478
Look, it's kind of messy.
If you called earlier,

06:21.510 --> 06:23.603
I would have tried
to clean up and
whatnot, but--

06:23.650 --> 06:26.517
Oh, well, that defeats
the purpose of a home
visit, right?

06:27.920 --> 06:29.649
Yeah, you right.
Come on.

06:29.690 --> 06:33.148
Blue, say hello
to Mr. Jarvis.

06:33.190 --> 06:35.556
- Hi.
- Hey, little man.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.497
Give me a high five.

06:39.530 --> 06:42.829
- So, what you
drawing there?
- Mommy.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.065
Do you know her?

06:47.100 --> 06:49.807
No, I don't, actually.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.204
But I like what
you're doing, though.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.514
- Thank you.
- Jarvis: You're welcome.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.189
Blue, let's go
brush your teeth.

07:03.220 --> 07:04.915
I'll take you over
to Aunt Violet's

07:04.950 --> 07:07.180
once I'm done
talking to Mr. Jarvis.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.552
Blue:
Okay.

07:09.590 --> 07:10.989
Ralph Angel:
Sorry.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.528
Hey.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.528
Jarvis:
All right.

07:16.570 --> 07:19.789
Come on, take a seat.
I'll get some of this
stuff up here.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.796
It's all good.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.058
All right.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.930
So, Blue has
his own room, huh?

07:25.970 --> 07:27.801
Sure does.
It's big, too.

07:27.840 --> 07:29.102
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

07:29.140 --> 07:31.244
So, he's not living here
with you, though?

07:31.280 --> 07:34.215
Where else _
he supposed to live?

07:34.250 --> 07:36.582
With his appointed
legal guardian--

07:36.620 --> 07:39.214
your aunt.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.720
My Aunt Vi was only
watching him when
I was inside.

07:45.130 --> 07:48.691
DCFS rule says...

07:48.730 --> 07:50.220
she has custody
for another year.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.090
Why?

07:52.130 --> 07:55.236
I've been out
for seven months without
Violating my parole.

07:55.270 --> 07:57.135
- I got my own place--
- Hey, listen.

07:57.170 --> 07:59.604
You don't have
to convmce me.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.733
Convince your aunt.

08:01.780 --> 08:04.704
Now, if she signs that,

08:04.750 --> 08:07.014
you'll have full custody
of Blue again.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.585
Is Mom back
in the picture?

08:14.620 --> 08:16.759
Hell, no.

08:16.790 --> 08:20.590
She just watched him
one time for the funeral.

08:20.630 --> 08:23.019
Seems to have left
an Impressmn.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.998
- Is she clean now?
- So she say.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.008
Says she got a job
with benefits,

08:30.040 --> 08:32.167
but I don't know.

08:33.640 --> 08:37.144
You know,
speaking of jobs...

08:37.180 --> 08:40.274
you want to tell me
what went down at
the warehouse?

08:40.320 --> 08:42.641
I got laid off.

08:43.790 --> 08:45.746
- I heard.
- Mm-hmm.

08:45.790 --> 08:48.008
You know,
it's funny timing,

08:48.060 --> 08:52.895
'cause I remember you
complaining about that job
before you got laid off.

08:52.930 --> 08:55.148
Right before the bust.
You hear about that?

08:55.200 --> 08:56.929
Nah, what happened?

08:59.100 --> 09:01.295
I know you know something
happened, Ralph Angel,

09:01.340 --> 09:03.160
'cause
the Sheriff's Department
came out here.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.802
And they didn't
find nothing.

09:04.840 --> 09:06.205
Mm.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.048
Well, if you
don't know nothing,

09:10.080 --> 09:12.048
let me fill you in.

09:12.080 --> 09:14.674
The guys
you were working with
was running a racket.

09:14.720 --> 09:18.042
They were stealing
cell phones and laptops.

09:18.090 --> 09:21.480
And now they're looking
at five to 10 years.

09:25.360 --> 09:28.352
So, considering
the circumstances,

09:28.400 --> 09:31.927
I'm not going to
report you because
you're out of a job,

09:31.970 --> 09:35.929
but you're going to
need to find one fast.

09:35.970 --> 09:38.939
I'm gonna work here,
on the farm.

09:38.970 --> 09:42.098
- Got it all worked out.
- ( sighs )

09:42.140 --> 09:44.847
We've gone over this,
Ralph Angel.

09:46.380 --> 09:49.713
You need_
a working busmess
to employ you,

09:49.750 --> 09:51.945
something with a tax ID
and a DBA number.

09:51.990 --> 09:54.686
The farm got all that.
My sister made sure of it.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.120
Okay, so can
your sister make sure
that you get paid

09:57.160 --> 09:59.355
minimum wage
at 40 hours a week,

09:59.390 --> 10:01.950
plus health insurance
and worker's comp?

10:02.000 --> 10:04.218
That's not
gonna be a problem.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.862
Okay.

10:07.270 --> 10:08.862
Okay.

10:11.410 --> 10:14.402
You have her...

10:14.440 --> 10:16.977
do all that you said

10:17.010 --> 10:20.013
and fill that out.

10:20.050 --> 10:22.041
You can work here
for your parole.

10:26.790 --> 10:31.853
* Life doesn't come
from falling apart *

10:31.890 --> 10:34.120
* Take that book,
turn the page *

10:34.160 --> 10:36.867
* Look up where you are

10:36.900 --> 10:41.394
* Life doesn't come from
falling apart *

10:41.440 --> 10:42.907
* Light a candle...

10:42.940 --> 10:44.862
Where are you going?

10:44.910 --> 10:46.309
Hey.

10:46.340 --> 10:47.773
Um...

10:47.810 --> 10:49.277
I didn't know
if you wanted me

10:49.310 --> 10:51.744
to hang around
all day, so...

10:51.780 --> 10:53.316
( laughing )

10:57.190 --> 10:58.748
What you want
for breakfast?

10:58.790 --> 11:01.418
Mmm.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.883
* Light that candle,
take it out *

11:03.930 --> 11:06.057
* Go and see the stars

11:06.090 --> 11:11.027
* Whoever you run from,
that's who you are... *

11:11.070 --> 11:13.436
I got an interview
with an artist
I'm profiling

11:13.470 --> 11:16.439
later_ this afternoon
In Bywater.

11:16.470 --> 11:18.028
Do you want to roll?

11:18.070 --> 11:21.335
Yeah. Yeah, I want
to roll with you.

11:34.490 --> 11:37.823
I'm feeling something
I haven't felt in
a very long time.

11:39.230 --> 11:40.356
What's that?

11:44.270 --> 11:46.830
Free.

11:46.870 --> 11:49.338
So, Prosper's off
with a few guys.

11:49.370 --> 11:52.203
They'll be done
planting by end of day.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.107
I'll load the tank up,
start fertilizing later.

11:56.510 --> 11:58.273
Charley.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.940
Yo, everything
all right with you?

12:01.980 --> 12:04.949
Hey, you know that
don't go on my cane, right?

12:04.990 --> 12:06.343
This is for
the second-year stubble.

12:06.390 --> 12:08.381
We've got organic manure
coming in for your cane.

12:08.420 --> 12:10.354
Organic shit?

12:10.390 --> 12:13.359
I thought all shit
was organic.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.356
Remy:
You need any help
tying down the equipment?

12:15.400 --> 12:16.992
For what?

12:17.030 --> 12:19.498
There's been
a storm warning.
Haven't you heard?

12:19.530 --> 12:22.533
It's not gonna ruin
any of our crops, is it?

12:22.570 --> 12:25.505
Not if you get
all the seed cane
in the ground in time.

12:25.540 --> 12:28.100
I mean, unless
the root system
is damaged,

12:28.140 --> 12:29.402
it should be ﬁne.

12:29.440 --> 12:30.998
Hey, which one
of you guys are
the owner?

12:31.050 --> 12:32.244
- Right here.
- Me.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.872
- ( man chuckles ) Okay.
- Both of us.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.377
Well, just let her know
where to put the tanker at.

12:36.420 --> 12:37.546
( Ralph Angel scoffs )

12:37.590 --> 12:39.148
I guess you'll be
the one paying, huh?

12:39.190 --> 12:43.388
- What do I owe you?
- $3,750, ma'am.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.125
All right, thank you.
How are you today?

12:45.160 --> 12:46.991
- Okay.
- Good, good.

12:47.030 --> 12:48.520
- ( swipes card )
- ( beeps )

12:48.560 --> 12:50.391
It's declined.

12:50.430 --> 12:52.295
- Just run it again.
- Sure.

12:55.300 --> 12:58.428
It's reading
"insufficient funds,"
ma'am.

12:58.470 --> 13:00.870
That's not possible.

13:00.910 --> 13:03.049
I'm sorry.
I can't leave the tanker
without getting paid.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.877
Well, can you wait
until I call the bank?

13:04.910 --> 13:07.413
Do I have a choice?

13:07.450 --> 13:09.543
Sorry, bro.
Give us a second.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.888
It's all good.

13:10.920 --> 13:13.286
Card declined.

13:13.320 --> 13:15.288
Hi, this is Charlotte
Bordelon-West.

13:15.320 --> 13:18.050
Yeah, my card just declined.
I'd like to know why.

13:19.460 --> 13:23.021
$10,000?
To who?

13:23.070 --> 13:26.426
To All Out Bail Bonds?

13:26.470 --> 13:28.199
Don't look at me.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.600
Mm.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.575
It's a beautiful
garden.

13:35.610 --> 13:37.339
You'll see how much better
your omelet wnll taste

13:37.380 --> 13:38.904
with these
fresh herbs in it.

13:38.950 --> 13:40.178
( chuckles )

13:40.220 --> 13:42.074
I'm happy
with these herbs.

13:50.260 --> 13:53.093
( car door slams )

13:53.130 --> 13:55.496
- Just a sec.
- All right.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.468
Charley?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.102
What are you doing here?
What's wrong?

14:05.140 --> 14:07.472
You!
Nova, you're wrong.

14:07.510 --> 14:10.206
You took $10,000
from me without so much
as a phone call?

14:10.250 --> 14:11.649
Look, I wanted
to tell you about it.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.614
Yeah, the bank
beat you to it.

14:13.650 --> 14:16.210
I'm sorry,
but I had to do something
to help Too Sweet.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.218
And after all
the shit you gave me

14:18.250 --> 14:21.356
whenever I offered
to pay for anything
at Daddy's funeral.

14:21.390 --> 14:23.119
When_ it serves
your Interests,

14:23.160 --> 14:24.479
you have no problem
stealing money from me.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.486
"Stealing"
is a harsh word.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.498
I borrowed that money.
I fully plan on
returning it.

14:28.530 --> 14:30.225
Taking money
without permission

14:30.270 --> 14:32.226
is the definition
of stealing, Nova.

14:32.270 --> 14:34.135
However you want
to define it, okay.

14:34.170 --> 14:36.365
I am apologizing.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.662
I should have talked
to you about it,

14:37.710 --> 14:40.372
but I'm not sorry
I did it.

14:40.410 --> 14:42.139
What if it had been Micah?

14:42.180 --> 14:44.102
You would have put down
bail money on him

14:44.150 --> 14:46.106
instead of wasting
$3 million

14:46.150 --> 14:47.970
on a trifling-ass
guilty man.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.647
Don't bring my family
into this

14:49.680 --> 14:51.386
and don't count my money.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.251
Everything cool?

14:53.290 --> 14:55.155
Yeah.
This is my sister.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.918
And don't ever talk
to me about anybody's
"trifling ass."

15:05.030 --> 15:06.292
( scoffs )

15:09.470 --> 15:11.563
( giggling )

15:11.610 --> 15:13.407
- Okay.
- Micah: Okay.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.579
Uh-oh,
I think I got a pair.
I think I got a pair.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.146
You got two?

15:17.180 --> 15:18.272
Yeah!

15:18.310 --> 15:19.675
Man, I thought
I was gonna win,

15:19.710 --> 15:21.018
but it looks like
you're beating me.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.142
( laughing )

15:22.180 --> 15:24.148
Teaching that boy
how to play Bid Whist?

15:24.190 --> 15:26.283
Ah... yeah!
( laughing )

15:26.320 --> 15:28.015
Uncle Hollywood,
what did you bring me?

15:28.060 --> 15:30.028
What, I ain't enough?

15:30.060 --> 15:31.721
- Welcome back, man.
- Thank you.

15:31.760 --> 15:33.694
See, that's how you
talk to your uncle,
all right?

15:33.730 --> 15:36.198
- How y'all boys been?
- Just playing some cards.

15:36.230 --> 15:38.596
Hey, you been trying
to steal my cigars again,
haven't you?

15:38.630 --> 15:41.235
Gotta keep my eye
on you at all times.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.602
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.302
- Mm-hmm.
- I missed you.

15:47.340 --> 15:49.433
Oh,
I missed you, baby.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.345
Damn, damn.
I missed you.

15:51.380 --> 15:53.519
- Mm...
- ( Micah clears throat)

15:56.650 --> 15:59.039
Oh, yeah.
You said you wanted
something, right, Blue?

15:59.090 --> 16:00.751
Yeah.

16:00.790 --> 16:02.314
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.180
Why don't y'all go
to the ice cream store?

16:04.230 --> 16:06.084
- Ooh, you want to go
get some ice cream?
- Of course.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.324
- "Of course."
- ( all laugh )

16:07.360 --> 16:08.497
Come on, let's go.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.499
Wait... Micah?

16:11.530 --> 16:12.758
You ain't
got to hurry back.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.337
( stammers, scoffs )

16:15.370 --> 16:17.065
Micah:
Hey, slow down,
little man.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.600
Why don't you
help me unpack?

16:18.640 --> 16:21.074
I think we both
got some unpacking
to do.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.338
Yes, we do.

16:22.380 --> 16:24.974
- ( chatter)
- ( sizzling )

16:28.680 --> 16:31.114
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:32.390 --> 16:33.755
Thanks.

16:33.790 --> 16:35.678
Ain't no thing.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.118
So, Nova take the $10,000?

16:40.160 --> 16:42.424
Let's not talk about it.

16:45.130 --> 16:47.769
I told the delivery guy
to come back this afternoon.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.769
Think you can
be there to pay him?

16:50.810 --> 16:53.802
( laughs )
Why not?

16:53.840 --> 16:57.276
All I do around here
is dispense cash,
apparently.

17:00.550 --> 17:01.778
How can I help you?

17:01.820 --> 17:03.378
I'll have
the crab cake salad.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.411
Corned beef Benny.

17:05.450 --> 17:07.259
Oh, and go easy
on the sauce.

17:07.290 --> 17:09.383
Oh, I'll serve it up
any way you want it,
honey.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.422
( laughing )

17:18.700 --> 17:21.260
There's something else,
Charley.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.790
What is it?

17:22.840 --> 17:24.603
What?

17:25.740 --> 17:28.300
We ran out
of seed cane?

17:28.340 --> 17:31.400
The workers
are on strike?
What?

17:31.450 --> 17:33.816
No, planting's
going fine, but...

17:33.850 --> 17:36.819
that ain't gonna matter
if we don't have no mill
to grind It for us.

17:36.850 --> 17:39.819
What do you mean?
Daddy had a deal
with the mill.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.819
Yeah, but he wasn't
able to grind last year,

17:42.860 --> 17:44.225
so they dropped
his contract.

17:45.860 --> 17:47.555
You're just now
telling me this?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.420
Take it easy.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.166
I'm sure _
they'll renew It.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.293
- I'll drive by there after--
- No. I got it.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.059
You focus on farming.
It's what you're best at,
anyway.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.576
You know,
about that.

18:00.610 --> 18:03.249
I've been meaning
to talk to you about
something.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.484
I want to farm full-time.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.715
But the only way
I could do that is
if you make me

18:15.760 --> 18:18.456
an official employee
and pay me.

18:18.490 --> 18:20.720
Why would I pay you?

18:20.760 --> 18:23.467
You're a co-owner.
You'll get your payout
at harvest,

18:23.500 --> 18:25.593
- like Nova and me.
- That aIn't gonna help
my parole requirement.

18:25.630 --> 18:27.734
I need a paystub now.

18:27.770 --> 18:30.204
You have that warehouse job.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.639
Why is everyone
doing this?

18:31.670 --> 18:34.332
- Everybody's not--
- What do I look like?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.507
- Chill, Charley.
- "Charley's fine with it,
because she's got money."

18:36.540 --> 18:38.872
- Yo, relax--
- Why does everyone
mmsmmwm

18:38.910 --> 18:42.778
- think it's okay
to take, take, take?
- It's okay, I got it.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.811
I said I got it.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.622
Can I get them
orders to go?

18:58.670 --> 19:00.535
You should not
be eating alone,
Ralph Angel.

19:02.270 --> 19:04.409
So, you own a farm?

19:05.570 --> 19:06.901
Sugarcane.

19:06.940 --> 19:10.376
I would love to come
and see It sometime.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.241
Man:
I ordered water
three times.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.542
It never came.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.639
And...
when my wife's meal

19:15.680 --> 19:17.386
finally got here,
mine's cold.

19:17.420 --> 19:20.412
My apologies.
I'll get you
a full refund.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.382
How you doing, Dan?

19:25.430 --> 19:27.819
Missing you, Violet.
Missing you.

19:30.700 --> 19:32.292
I see things
are going well.

19:32.330 --> 19:34.537
What do you want?

19:34.570 --> 19:35.969
My last paycheck, Clive.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.401
I noticed you too cheap
to mail it, so I'm here.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.408
How much longer
you gonna pretend
you ain't coming back?

19:41.440 --> 19:42.930
I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:42.980 --> 19:44.948
I got a man who takes care
of me, my own home...

19:44.980 --> 19:46.800
It's your ex-husband's.

19:46.850 --> 19:49.410
Yeah, well,
he ain't coming back
to get it, so it's mine.

19:49.450 --> 19:51.839
Either way,
don't nobody need
this hot mess.

19:56.460 --> 19:58.451
Roberta.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.958
Vi.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.321
Hey,
so you coming
to Hollywood's

20:03.370 --> 20:04.860
crawfish boil tonight?

20:04.900 --> 20:06.822
Yeah, I'ma be there.

20:06.870 --> 20:08.838
All right.

20:08.870 --> 20:10.735
- Hey, Aunt Vi?
- Mm-hmm.

20:10.770 --> 20:12.909
I got to talk to you
about something.

20:14.480 --> 20:15.731
Bye, Roberta.

20:18.610 --> 20:20.475
What's up?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.977
It's about Blue.
Ahem.

20:23.020 --> 20:26.979
On paper,
you're his legal
guardian still.

20:27.020 --> 20:29.250
I want you to sign
him over to me.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.588
No.

20:33.630 --> 20:35.450
What?

20:35.500 --> 20:36.751
What you mean, no?

20:39.630 --> 20:40.892
Come on.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.265
Bye, now.

20:49.910 --> 20:52.344
It ain't been a week

20:52.380 --> 20:54.610
since I cleared a bunch
of stolen cell phones

20:54.650 --> 20:56.868
out that shed.

20:56.920 --> 20:58.740
We both know how that
could have ended.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.054
But it didn't.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.786
How am I supposed to know
there ain't gonna be
a next time?

21:06.390 --> 21:08.620
What would have happened
ifI hadn't been there
for you?

21:08.660 --> 21:11.891
What if you had gone
backin

21:11.930 --> 21:14.899
and I wasn't
Blue's guardian?

21:14.940 --> 21:16.931
I'll tell you what--
he would have gone
to Darla.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.908
The courts don't know
what we know.

21:20.940 --> 21:23.909
That Hollywood found her
turning tricks in a shed.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.510
Blue, dirty,
dehydrated,

21:26.550 --> 21:29.371
half near dead
laying right beside
his mama.

21:29.420 --> 21:31.786
Sweat from the man
on top of her

21:31.820 --> 21:33.515
dropping down
onto that baby.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.551
No, they don't know that.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.928
They don't know
and they won't care.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.053
They'll take him from us
and give him to her,

21:41.100 --> 21:43.796
and I'm telling you right now,
Ralph Angel Bordelon,

21:43.830 --> 21:45.388
that...

21:45.430 --> 21:48.069
will only happen
over my dead and
buried body.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.738
I mean that.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.828
Now, I told you
to stop calling me,
all right?

22:14.860 --> 22:17.727
No, no, no, no.
You stay exactly
where you are.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.091
Leanne, listen to me.

22:20.130 --> 22:23.429
Everything's
gonna be fine,
all right?

22:23.470 --> 22:25.461
Now, you trust me,
right?

22:25.510 --> 22:28.331
Okay, you got to do
exactly what I tell you
to do.

22:30.010 --> 22:31.443
Okay, yeah.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.574
Okay, yeah, yeah.
I'll come see you.

22:34.620 --> 22:35.871
Look, I got to go.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.980
Appreciate it.
You guys have
a great day.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.452
- It's good talking to you.
- All right, man.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.128
Thank you.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.869
So, I hope you and Nova
got to patch things up.

22:51.900 --> 22:54.130
That is not
how Nova operates.

22:54.170 --> 22:56.991
Her apologies are empty

22:57.040 --> 22:58.860
because in the end,

22:58.910 --> 23:01.128
it's all about her
and her self-righteousness.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.648
- Well, Charley--
- And now Ralph Angel.

23:05.650 --> 23:08.915
He asked me
to hire him today.

23:08.950 --> 23:10.884
Can you believe that?

23:10.920 --> 23:13.889
He can never hold down
a job for more than a month

23:13.920 --> 23:17.014
and expects me
to put him in charge.

23:17.060 --> 23:19.153
All everybody does
is take.

23:19.190 --> 23:22.023
Just take what they want
and leave me to pay for it.

23:22.060 --> 23:23.891
That's what I do,
I pay...

23:23.930 --> 23:26.023
for other people's
mistakes.

23:26.070 --> 23:28.891
Well, you know what?
Screw it.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.760
I'm gonna divorce
my liar of a husband

23:30.810 --> 23:32.163
and take him
for all he's worth.

23:32.210 --> 23:35.771
Then I'm gonna get
the hell out of here.

23:35.810 --> 23:38.074
Because I can write checks
from anywhere.

23:40.550 --> 23:42.814
Can I say something
real quick?

23:53.090 --> 23:54.921
I'm sorry
for all the people

23:54.960 --> 23:56.723
who can't say
they're sorry.

23:58.970 --> 24:02.565
I'm sorry
they're not giving you
what you need right now.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.706
But please,

24:05.740 --> 24:08.675
don't let anyone--
and I mean anyone--

24:08.710 --> 24:11.201
steal your joy.

24:11.250 --> 24:14.708
That... light.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.069
Your fight.

24:16.120 --> 24:19.248
I mean,
that's what
makes you you.

24:19.290 --> 24:21.611
Charley, you're
an incredible woman.

24:24.030 --> 24:25.884
Believe that.

24:40.610 --> 24:42.601
See you tonight.

24:47.010 --> 24:48.477
( car door opens )

24:49.650 --> 24:52.141
( soft chatter )

24:52.190 --> 24:53.714
Y'all home?

24:53.760 --> 24:55.489
Oh, back here, baby.

24:58.290 --> 25:00.121
- Hey!
- Hey.

25:00.160 --> 25:02.253
- Good to have you back.
- Yeah.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.860
- She putting you
to work already?
- She sure is.

25:04.900 --> 25:07.733
Only way to make a man happy
is to make him feel useful.

25:07.770 --> 25:09.988
I'll remember that.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.735
Is Charley around?

25:11.770 --> 25:13.670
Violet:
She's still out
at the farm.

25:17.310 --> 25:20.006
- Hey.
- Hey.

25:20.050 --> 25:21.745
What you been up to?

25:21.780 --> 25:22.940
Not much.

25:25.820 --> 25:29.756
Listen, there's
an art exhibit I'm doing
a story on in New Orleans.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.326
You want to join us?

25:31.360 --> 25:32.657
Please?

25:34.660 --> 25:37.322
Well, I mean,
unless you want me
to help with the lights.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.897
I don't know.
Let me think about it.

25:42.070 --> 25:43.662
- You think so?
- Mm.

25:45.670 --> 25:47.774
( laughs )
Nah, I think we can
manage without you.

25:47.810 --> 25:51.177
- ( laughing )
- Y'all go have a good time.

25:51.210 --> 25:53.303
- Nova:
We'll see y'all later.
- Both: All right.

25:53.350 --> 25:55.716
Y'all have a good time.

25:56.980 --> 25:59.187
Ah, ah, no.

25:59.220 --> 26:01.688
- Holleood:
No, you're pulling it, now.
- Okay, you do it!

26:09.400 --> 26:11.322
Mr. Odums?

26:11.370 --> 26:13.668
Hey, peace.
"Bmike" is fine.

26:13.700 --> 26:15.668
Nova Bordelon,
"New Orleans Daily News."

26:15.700 --> 26:17.099
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you,
brother.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.832
Oh, wow.

26:19.870 --> 26:21.679
"I am a man."

26:21.710 --> 26:24.372
But he's
so young here.

26:24.410 --> 26:25.968
Who's that?

26:27.110 --> 26:28.338
I mean, I know...

26:28.380 --> 26:30.348
I know Trayvon Martin,

26:30.380 --> 26:32.086
I know Mike Brown.
But who are the other two?

26:32.120 --> 26:36.113
Okay, so, have you
ever seen the movie
"Fruitvale Station"?

26:36.160 --> 26:37.855
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:37.890 --> 26:41.849
Okay, well, that's him.
That's Oscar Grant.

26:41.900 --> 26:43.959
And this is Eric Garner,

26:44.000 --> 26:47.367
the father who was
choked to death
in New York.

26:47.400 --> 26:50.699
His final words
were captured on camera.

26:50.740 --> 26:52.367
"I can't breathe,"

26:52.410 --> 26:55.629
which is a rallying call
to this day.

26:57.010 --> 26:58.978
You ever been?

26:59.010 --> 27:00.978
To a rally? No.

27:01.020 --> 27:03.716
There's all kind of
actions and protests

27:03.750 --> 27:05.115
taking place
in California.

27:05.150 --> 27:06.708
And our comrades
over there?

27:06.750 --> 27:08.149
Yeah,
they don't play.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.719
I just--
I've never been mistreated
by police before.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.251
Or anyone,
for that matter.

27:16.300 --> 27:18.996
I guess it's because
of who my dad is.

27:19.030 --> 27:20.395
Davis West.

27:20.430 --> 27:23.433
It doesn't really
matter who he is.

27:23.470 --> 27:25.404
The question is,
who are you?

27:25.440 --> 27:28.773
- Hm.
- And who do you
want to be?

27:29.910 --> 27:31.172
- Yeah?
- Okay.

27:31.210 --> 27:32.404
- You know?
- Okay.

27:32.450 --> 27:33.917
All right, okay!

27:33.950 --> 27:36.009
- Don't be scared, now.
- I'm not scared.

27:36.050 --> 27:39.144
Come on, let's go
look at some more art.

27:39.190 --> 27:41.158
I started off speaking
to a small audience.

27:41.190 --> 27:43.010
At least I thought.
I just wanted to speak
to the people

27:43.060 --> 27:44.425
in the communities
I painted In.

27:44.460 --> 27:46.325
I felt like if--

27:46.360 --> 27:50.023
especially post-Katrina--
if these neighborhoods
were sick,

27:50.060 --> 27:52.426
then my art had a way
of providing some type
of healing.

27:52.470 --> 27:55.462
So, I initially thought
it was just those people
on that block,

27:55.500 --> 27:59.038
or on that corner,
or, you know, within
that neighborhood.

27:59.070 --> 28:02.176
And I was surprised
to see that it resonated
far and wide,

28:02.210 --> 28:05.338
but it was one of those
things that, now that more
people paid attention,

28:05.380 --> 28:07.769
I had to make sure
I was saying something.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.310
I truly thank you

28:09.350 --> 28:10.942
for doing the work
that you're doing,
brother.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.446
- Keep it up.
- It's all good.

28:12.490 --> 28:15.914
(TV playing
in background )

28:15.960 --> 28:17.825
How are things
at the farm?

28:17.860 --> 28:19.088
Let's see.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.791
We're way behind.

28:20.830 --> 28:22.320
Don't have a mill deal.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.920
And all the work
and money I put into it

28:24.970 --> 28:27.939
may be for nothing
if the storm hits us
too hard.

28:27.970 --> 28:30.461
But, you know,

28:30.500 --> 28:32.934
other than that...

28:32.970 --> 28:35.074
Well,
y'all wanted this.

28:35.110 --> 28:38.477
Yeah, well, I was hoping
I would have more help.

28:38.510 --> 28:40.341
Ralph Angel is willing.

28:40.380 --> 28:42.348
Ralph Angel is willing
ifI pay him.

28:42.380 --> 28:44.848
Doesn't he have
that warehouse job?

28:44.890 --> 28:46.812
Not anymore.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.353
Well, he shouldn't
have quit

28:49.390 --> 28:51.119
or gotten himself fired.

28:53.130 --> 28:55.519
They were running a crime ring
out of that warehouse.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.528
If he had stayed,

28:57.560 --> 29:00.427
they would have dragged him
right back into jail.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.436
Everything isn't
as it seems, baby.

29:10.310 --> 29:12.972
And everyone's
not out to get you.

29:13.010 --> 29:16.969
Ralph Angel is trying.
He's trying to be a man.

29:17.020 --> 29:21.116
Listen, Lord knows
when it comes to him,

29:21.160 --> 29:23.981
I sometimes am guilty
for the same feelings
that you're having.

29:24.030 --> 29:27.284
But if his own family
don't help him, who will?

29:34.470 --> 29:36.392
Is Micah here?

29:36.440 --> 29:38.533
No.

29:38.570 --> 29:42.028
He's in NOLA
with Nova.

29:42.080 --> 29:44.002
With Nova?

29:44.050 --> 29:45.403
Yes.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.873
You're freaking
kidding me.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.569
Who told him
he could do that?

29:49.620 --> 29:52.282
Charley, I did.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.582
( line ringing )

29:53.620 --> 29:57.010
( phone ringing )

29:57.060 --> 29:58.322
Hello.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.021
What makes you think
you can just take off

30:00.060 --> 30:01.288
without a word?

30:01.330 --> 30:03.150
I asked Aunt Violet.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.895
You're supposed to ask me.

30:04.930 --> 30:06.591
Okay, well,
you weren't there.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.598
I have a lot
to deal with, Micah.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.289
I don't _need
you to gIve me
any more grief.

30:10.340 --> 30:13.036
Grief? I went
to an art exhibit.

30:13.070 --> 30:14.173
Where are you now?

30:14.210 --> 30:17.577
I'm at Aunt Nova's.

30:17.610 --> 30:19.373
I want you to come home.

30:20.950 --> 30:23.077
Yeah, Mom,
and where is that,
exactly?

30:25.220 --> 30:27.438
Come back
to Violet's, now.

30:27.490 --> 30:29.583
No discussion.

30:40.000 --> 30:40.364
Hey, Ralph Angel.

30:44.640 --> 30:48.474
I thought I'd take you up
on your offer to show me
your farm.

30:48.510 --> 30:50.273
I had no idea
how big it is.

30:53.150 --> 30:54.242
Ah.

30:55.980 --> 30:59.211
I brought you
a housewarming gift.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.150
Mm-hmm.

31:05.430 --> 31:06.886
Is your son home?

31:08.530 --> 31:11.124
If he was,
you wouldn't be here.

31:20.270 --> 31:23.103
Shower's to the right.

31:23.140 --> 31:24.300
Clean up.

31:26.550 --> 31:29.018
And leave all that off.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.147
Mm.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.652
- * Oh, baby...
- (Violet laughing )

31:41.700 --> 31:44.294
All right, that's great.

31:46.030 --> 31:48.169
Okay, Blue,
you want to help me?

31:48.200 --> 31:49.531
Do you want to get that
for me there?

31:49.570 --> 31:51.663
- Hey!
- Hey.

31:51.710 --> 31:55.407
- Ms. Violet. Mr. Blue.
- Hey there. How are you
doing, Remy?

31:55.440 --> 31:57.135
- You got a cooler?
- Yeah.

31:57.180 --> 31:59.171
Oh, good.

31:59.210 --> 32:02.043
You feeling any better?
Or should I ask?

32:02.080 --> 32:04.548
Haven't you heard
enough from me today?

32:04.590 --> 32:06.285
No.

32:06.320 --> 32:08.185
- ( car doors close )
- ( phone ringing )

32:10.590 --> 32:12.683
- Nova: Hello?
- Be right back.

32:12.730 --> 32:15.153
- Blue: Micah!
- Micah: 'Sup, man?

32:15.200 --> 32:17.088
How are you?

32:18.730 --> 32:20.322
Charley:
Hey.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.601
_ Nova:
CaIVIn, you've got
to stop calling me!

32:27.640 --> 32:29.437
Look, if you want
to walk, walk,

32:29.480 --> 32:31.505
but_ don't make
leavmg your Wife
about me.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.338
I got to go.
Bye.

32:39.350 --> 32:42.183
So, on top
of everything else

32:42.220 --> 32:45.189
you're seeing
a married man?

32:45.230 --> 32:47.482
No.

32:47.530 --> 32:50.226
We broke up.

32:50.260 --> 32:51.761
( scoffs )

32:51.800 --> 32:54.337
Do what you want
with your own life,

32:54.370 --> 32:57.191
but the next time
you want to take
my son somewhere,

32:57.240 --> 32:59.663
you call me first.

33:03.380 --> 33:05.075
Hollywood:
They're still arguing?

33:05.110 --> 33:07.203
Yep.

33:07.250 --> 33:10.617
It ain't my business,
but somebody ought to
tell them they're grown.

33:10.650 --> 33:13.744
Ain't nothing
that can't be solved
with a little talk.

33:13.790 --> 33:15.519
Okay, maybe you should
take your own advice

33:15.560 --> 33:18.484
and talk to Aunt Violet
about whoever keeps
calling you.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.486
What,
Leanne, is it?

33:20.530 --> 33:22.122
You don't know what
you're talking about.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.367
I heard you
on the phone.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.493
- It's not what you think.
- ( scoffs )

33:26.530 --> 33:28.634
Know who you
sound like?

33:28.670 --> 33:29.989
My dad.

33:31.670 --> 33:33.399
Guess that's what happens
with grown folk,

33:33.440 --> 33:35.635
they start lying.

33:35.680 --> 33:39.104
I just-- I just thought
you'd be different.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.277
Micah.

33:41.320 --> 33:42.719
Micah!

33:44.290 --> 33:45.382
Man:
One!

33:45.420 --> 33:46.409
Two!

33:46.450 --> 33:48.782
One, two, three, four!

33:48.820 --> 33:50.685
( music playing )

33:53.430 --> 33:56.024
( chatter)

33:59.430 --> 34:01.534
Hollywood:
Ralph Angel!

34:01.570 --> 34:03.128
( laughing )

34:03.170 --> 34:05.035
What's up, boy?

34:13.580 --> 34:15.810
You're late.

34:15.850 --> 34:19.149
I was taking care
of some things.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.839
Where's Blue?

34:20.890 --> 34:22.812
Sleeping.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.418
He eat?

34:24.460 --> 34:26.451
Of course.
( laughs )

34:26.490 --> 34:28.697
He was outside
playing all day.

34:28.730 --> 34:31.324
About wore himself out.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.591
You want me to make
you a plate?

34:38.740 --> 34:40.469
Yeah.

34:40.510 --> 34:42.478
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

34:42.510 --> 34:44.068
"Thank you."
( chuckles )

34:46.880 --> 34:48.472
- You done with that?
- Yeah.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.087
Something
bothering you?

34:54.890 --> 34:56.585
No, I'm good.

34:56.620 --> 34:58.326
Hollywood:
Hey, Vi, Vi, Vi.

34:58.360 --> 34:59.850
Come on,
let's show them
some moves, baby.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.757
I was gonna make
Ralph Angel a plate.

35:02.800 --> 35:05.325
Say, boy, you better make
your own plate, partner.

35:05.370 --> 35:06.894
- Hey!
- Huh? Huh?

35:06.930 --> 35:08.739
Violet:
No, that's trash, baby.

35:08.770 --> 35:10.192
( laughing )

35:10.240 --> 35:11.764
- Aw, yeah!
- Get it, Wood!

35:11.810 --> 35:13.209
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

35:13.240 --> 35:14.639
Get it!

35:16.510 --> 35:18.478
Remy:
Hey, don't hurt nothing.

35:18.510 --> 35:20.341
I ain't got
no insurance
out here!

35:20.380 --> 35:21.779
Dance floor!

35:21.820 --> 35:25.347
Hollywood:
Come on, this way.
Come on, now!

35:25.390 --> 35:27.779
- Come on with me.
Get my drink.
- Hey! Hey!

35:29.260 --> 35:30.887
Hey!

35:30.920 --> 35:34.356
- Ralph Angel:
You know what it is.
- ( laughing )

35:34.400 --> 35:36.356
Here to eat, eat!
Here to eat!

35:36.400 --> 35:38.527
Here to eat!
It's all I can eat.

35:46.410 --> 35:49.129
( cheering, laughing )

35:51.280 --> 35:54.272
( distant music, laughing )

36:03.820 --> 36:06.425
I was where you are
right now.

36:08.560 --> 36:10.699
When my wife,
Shauna, passed...

36:12.000 --> 36:14.389
I felt like
I wanted to run.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.533
Just--

36:16.570 --> 36:18.936
just pack
it all up and run.

36:18.970 --> 36:20.699
Literally.

36:23.710 --> 36:25.746
You can't outrun it,
though.

36:29.980 --> 36:32.210
I tried.

36:35.320 --> 36:39.279
Pretty soon, I realized
that it would just follow me,
because...

36:39.330 --> 36:41.457
grief wasn't
done with me.

36:43.730 --> 36:45.869
It leaves when it's done.

36:50.900 --> 36:52.731
You're gonna
get through this.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.331
Your husband,
your father.

36:59.010 --> 37:02.446
You just got to
take time to feel
it all.

37:02.480 --> 37:05.313
Don't let it chase you,
just...

37:05.350 --> 37:06.442
sit with it,

37:06.490 --> 37:08.981
listen to it,

37:09.020 --> 37:10.749
respect it.

37:10.790 --> 37:13.350
It's the only way
to survive it.

37:16.030 --> 37:19.625
You got people
that want the best
for you.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.368
But you know that
deep down, right?

37:31.910 --> 37:33.639
Excuse me.

37:39.050 --> 37:41.382
- Hollywood: Go fish!
- Nova: Hey, go fish!

37:41.420 --> 37:44.628
( all laughing )

37:44.660 --> 37:47.379
( car approaching )

37:53.670 --> 37:56.389
Is he here?
Is he here?

37:58.670 --> 37:59.932
Is he here?

37:59.970 --> 38:01.801
- Is he here?
- I don't know.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.671
Is he here?

38:06.080 --> 38:08.640
Is he here?

38:08.680 --> 38:11.649
Are you lost, baby?
You need directions?

38:11.690 --> 38:13.646
Who are you looking for,
sweetheart?

38:13.690 --> 38:16.284
Hollywood!
I've been calling him
all day.

38:18.430 --> 38:21.922
Hollywood,
what's she saying?
She say your name.

38:21.960 --> 38:24.053
Vi, this is my ex-wife.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.920
Wife!

38:25.970 --> 38:28.791
Don't you lie to her, Hollywood.
Don't you lie to her.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.400
We still married.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.965
( crying )
We still married.

38:34.010 --> 38:36.934
I don't know.
I don't know
where my baby is.

38:36.980 --> 38:39.676
Hollywood,
I can't find our baby.
I don't know where she is.

38:39.710 --> 38:42.577
It's okay, Leanne.
Leanne, she's safe.

38:42.620 --> 38:45.316
Wh-what baby?
I-I don't understand.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.418
We still Hollywood
and Leanne.
( sobbing )

38:49.460 --> 38:51.553
Hollywood, you better
start explaining.

38:51.590 --> 38:53.558
You should have
stayed with me,
Hollywood.

38:55.860 --> 38:58.829
Why didn't you stay with me?
We could have found our baby.

38:58.870 --> 39:00.428
Why didn't you stay?

39:00.470 --> 39:02.097
You have a child
with her?

39:02.140 --> 39:05.439
No, no.
The first year
that we were married

39:05.470 --> 39:08.132
she got pregnant
and had a miscarriage.

39:08.170 --> 39:10.832
- No!
- It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.440
No! It's not.
( mutters )

39:13.480 --> 39:16.449
Do you have your medication?
Is it in your purse?

39:16.480 --> 39:18.141
- Don't you touch him!
- No, don't, Vi!

39:18.180 --> 39:21.616
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Vi, Vi, she's bipolar.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.013
She needs her medication.

39:23.060 --> 39:25.984
She's got no business
putting her hands on you.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.591
We have every business.
We have every business.

39:29.630 --> 39:31.120
How long we been married,
Hollywood?

39:31.160 --> 39:33.594
How long?
Tell her.

39:33.630 --> 39:37.760
Sh_e needed
the insurance.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.769
She would have lost it
if we divorced proper.

39:43.040 --> 39:44.871
It's gonna be okay,
all right?

39:44.910 --> 39:47.640
I'm gonna take you back home.
You're gonna be fine.

39:49.520 --> 39:54.617
I'm just gonna take her
back to Baton Rouge.

39:54.660 --> 39:56.616
They'll know what to do
at the hospital.

39:56.660 --> 39:58.389
Hollywood...

40:02.560 --> 40:06.667
this whole time
you been back in
Baton Rouge?

40:10.940 --> 40:13.067
Answer me.

40:13.110 --> 40:16.898
When I got back,

40:16.940 --> 40:20.774
I went to see her
for two days.

40:20.810 --> 40:24.075
The hospital calls
because I'm the only
contact.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.815
( Leanne crying )

40:31.690 --> 40:34.557
So, every day

40:34.600 --> 40:36.420
you've been gone...

40:37.700 --> 40:39.429
you've been lying to me.

40:44.270 --> 40:47.205
- So we can--
- Every damn day.

40:47.240 --> 40:51.199
We can talk
about this, chre,
when I get back.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.674
No.

40:53.710 --> 40:55.712
Ain't no need
for you to come back.

41:02.020 --> 41:04.215
You don't mean that,
Violet.

41:04.260 --> 41:06.455
You just go on, now.

41:13.030 --> 41:14.122
Go.

41:16.170 --> 41:18.764
- Go.
- ( sighs )

41:25.750 --> 41:28.719
(voice breaks )
You follow me back
with the truck.

41:28.750 --> 41:30.741
Yeah, I got you.

41:37.160 --> 41:39.253
Don't worry, Hollywood.

41:39.290 --> 41:40.928
I got Aunt Vi.

41:42.300 --> 41:44.256
Okay.

41:44.300 --> 41:46.894
( sobbing )

41:48.770 --> 41:50.169
( Hollywood sobs )

41:59.950 --> 42:02.646
- ( car door closes )
- ( engine starts )

42:04.050 --> 42:05.642
( car door closes )

42:07.050 --> 42:08.813
( car engine starts )

42:35.820 --> 42:38.687
( music playing )
