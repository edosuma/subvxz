00:57.599 --> 01:00.435
<i>I mistook my ticket to survival</i>
<i>for freedom.</i>

01:01.144 --> 01:03.563
<i>But justice never boarded,</i>

01:03.646 --> 01:07.108
<i>and Wilford doubled down</i>
<i>with a Jackboot on our throats</i>

01:07.192 --> 01:09.694
<i>and a fat finger on the scales.</i>

01:10.987 --> 01:14.866
<i>Now some of us</i>

01:14.949 --> 01:20.163
<i>It will be perilous, filthy work.</i>
<i>More precious souls may be lost.</i>

01:20.246 --> 01:21.998
Clay, I don't want any trouble.
I'm just trying to work.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.877
-I can't be involved.
-You live in Third. You are involved.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.880
<i> But we didn't come this far,</i>
<i>suffer this much,</i>

01:29.547 --> 01:32.884
<i>to give in to the same tyranny</i>
<i>that destroyed us in the first place.</i>

01:34.010 --> 01:38.223
<i>Even on a frozen dead planet,</i>
<i>humanity needs hope.</i>

01:39.098 --> 01:45.897
<i>For these are our revolutions</i>
<i>on </i>Snowpiercer, <i>1,001 cars long.</i>

02:27.730 --> 02:29.149
Aw, did your wife make that?

02:30.316 --> 02:31.901
How long have you been married?

02:40.410 --> 02:43.705
What's your wife's name?
Where'd you guys meet?

02:47.041 --> 02:49.794
All this time in here,
and you still won't talk to me?

02:50.336 --> 02:52.505
What you say in here is admissible.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.299
So?

02:54.382 --> 02:56.092
So our smart visitors stay quiet.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.512
Your guilty visitors do.
I have nothing to hide.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.264
Uh-huh.

03:01.347 --> 03:06.811
My parents met in Saint Moritz,
on a chairlift.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.731
I know who your parents are.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.442
No. No, you don't. But you will.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.739
LJ, honey, are you all right?

03:17.822 --> 03:19.449
We're taking you home.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.617
Melanie.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.453
- Sweetheart, we miss you so much.
- You're coming home with us.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.747
LJ, today you stand trial for murder.

03:25.830 --> 03:28.082
-Do you understand that?

03:28.583 --> 03:29.417
Yes.

03:29.500 --> 03:32.003
You'll be expected
to speak on your own behalf,

03:32.629 --> 03:36.382
and a tribunal of ticketed passengers
will render a verdict. Is that all clear?

03:36.925 --> 03:39.677
-Mr. Wilford will be following closely.
- Good.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.889
Then he can see
how ridiculous this whole thing is.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.183
Tell it to Third,
where the three victims lived.

03:50.521 --> 03:54.275
She's just a child. The man
who committed these crimes is dead.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.486
You just throw her in a cell.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.988
Do you have any idea
how this is playing uptrain?

03:59.864 --> 04:02.742
We are bound by train rules
to detain her ahead of trial.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.035
That's all, Lilah.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.706
-It's okay.
-I don't belong in a drawer.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.585
Please escort them to their quarters.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.674
I just want to thank Mr. Wilford
for the chance to prove it.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.477
What are the chances, you figure,
that the tribunal convicts her?

04:31.688 --> 04:34.148
There's gonna be trouble in Third
if they let her off.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.150
There already is.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.947
It looks like
the infection's improving.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.119
Your poker face needs work, Doc.

04:46.828 --> 04:50.206
I was a vet. My patients didn't talk back.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.462
Message!

04:57.839 --> 04:59.132
Astrid sent another one.

05:01.509 --> 05:04.304
"Today." She wants me uptrain today?

05:04.387 --> 05:05.972
She must have some news on Layton.

05:06.931 --> 05:07.807
You ready, badass?

05:09.559 --> 05:11.019
-I put the chip in this bracelet.
-Uh-huh.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.437
Make sure you wear it nice and high.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.397
You're chipping the pad
just like anyone else.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.109
Be careful.

05:21.237 --> 05:23.865
This chip will get you
into Second Class.

05:29.078 --> 05:33.082
Jinju Seong,
as surety for this upgrade applicant,

05:33.166 --> 05:36.627
you accept liability for her conduct
during her probationary period.

05:36.711 --> 05:37.795
Understood?

05:38.463 --> 05:41.758
Yeah. If she messes up, we both suffer.

05:42.467 --> 05:43.468
Got it.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.638
-That should do it, Bess.
- Thanks, Doc.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.308
- And yours.
- Mmm.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.190
Okay, then.

05:57.732 --> 06:02.695
On behalf of Wilford Industries,
I hereby grant you, Bess Francis Till,

06:02.779 --> 06:06.074
access to Second Class
and all the entitlements therein.

06:07.575 --> 06:08.534
Thank you.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.704
Well, I guess we should
leave you two to celebrate.

06:19.837 --> 06:20.713
Wow.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.382
-Look at us.

06:24.592 --> 06:27.011
Made it three whole months
before shacking up.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.597
-A personal best for me.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.309
You sure about all this?

06:33.392 --> 06:36.938
"Second Class
and all the entitlements therein"? No.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.609
-But I was sure about you the day we met.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.076
No one's going to convict her.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.663
The tribunal is paid passengers,
First and Second. We know them.

06:55.456 --> 06:56.916
As long as you're prepared, sweetheart.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.001
She'll be prepared.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.213
But things happen on the stand.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.715
-LJ. Come on.
- Pay attention, honey.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.514
What do you think
it's like in the Drawers?

07:11.597 --> 07:13.975
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

07:14.058 --> 07:17.228
By tonight, this will all be over
and you'll be back here with us.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.312
Dad...

07:19.814 --> 07:20.731
can I?

07:23.651 --> 07:24.652
Not now, LJ.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.697
-But I want to.
- It's fine.

07:50.803 --> 07:51.679
Look.

07:55.099 --> 08:01.397
Okay, that's enough. Spit it.
It's not a day for your antics.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.028
The only thing that should be
in your mouth are these words:

08:07.653 --> 08:08.779
"He forced me."

08:08.863 --> 08:10.198
He did force me.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.410
You do know that, right?

08:14.494 --> 08:17.872
We know, sweetheart. We know.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.930
Tristan, stare out the window
on your own time, please.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.933
Sorry. I used to dream
I'd see the Amazon someday.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.144
Well, there's nothing out there now
but frozen lump.

08:41.687 --> 08:44.565
As soon as everyone's gone,
I want you to set up for the tribunal,

08:45.107 --> 08:46.609
as per the usual floor plan.

08:46.692 --> 08:47.735
Yes, ma'am.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.592
Service is over. What's that?

09:13.761 --> 09:15.137
-What's this?
- Enjoy.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.139
Compliments of the Nightcar.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.768
Mr. Sharma, wait!

09:24.105 --> 09:26.941
- My God! I...
-Go and get Melanie, now.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.121
That stunt
was beneath you, Audrey.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.582
No, it really wasn't.

09:47.044 --> 09:50.965
I'm sorry about Nikki. I am.

09:51.966 --> 09:55.845
But one suspect is dead and the other
is standing trial for murder.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.013
What am I missing?

09:57.096 --> 09:58.931
You know the trial is a joke.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.810
It's five miles uptrain,
where a jury of First and Second

10:02.893 --> 10:05.521
get to judge one of their own
for killing three of us.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.606
"Us"?

10:09.358 --> 10:12.153
The Nightcar
is supposed to be Switzerland.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.573
Why are you politicizing it?

10:20.453 --> 10:22.496
Third has the right to petition Wilford

10:22.580 --> 10:25.082
in labor disputes
and matters of jurisprudence.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.084
We want a new tribunal drawn.

10:27.168 --> 10:31.922
One representative from each class
and a delegation to observe the trial.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.176
For Chrissake, Audrey...

10:37.678 --> 10:39.722
You've grown callous
doing Wilford's bidding.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.853
You used to try to make a difference, too.

10:48.564 --> 10:52.026
I stood right here when you shared
your vision of the Nightcar.

10:55.071 --> 10:59.533
Wilford saw a brothel,
and you saw a higher purpose.

11:00.284 --> 11:02.119
And you persuaded him
I was right.

11:02.203 --> 11:05.331
And I am asking you
to stay true to your vision.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.250
You give us a place
to work through our grief,

11:08.334 --> 11:10.461
and the train depends on it.

11:10.544 --> 11:14.632
And we depend on you.
On your voice to Wilford's ear.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.469
Recommend a new tribunal.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.805
Or what?

11:22.807 --> 11:24.683
Don't make me threaten you, Melanie.

11:25.810 --> 11:29.772
Third touches every system on this train.
We will be heard.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.540
What has
the long-term suspension done to Nikki?

11:47.623 --> 11:49.875
I can tell you
the physiological effects.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.838
Necrosis of adrenal tissue,
hepatic insufficiencies. But...

11:54.755 --> 11:56.340
her mental state?

11:57.133 --> 11:59.844
I can't say whether
she would've improved or not.

12:00.928 --> 12:04.306
There wasn't enough time
to detox her fully.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.768
Are we assuming they're experiencing
something like locked-in syndrome?

12:07.852 --> 12:12.064
Maybe. We need to start
by reviving them much slower.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.233
We have 400 drawers.

12:14.316 --> 12:17.820
Someday, we may have 400 Sleepers.
They can't reemerge traumatized.

12:20.739 --> 12:24.326
Tell Mr. Wilford... I'm trying.

12:25.661 --> 12:26.662
Thank you.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.416
You okay?

12:30.499 --> 12:33.377
I heard Third are petitioning
for a spot on the tribunal.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.756
Are you considering it?

12:39.133 --> 12:41.719
LJ may actually get what she deserves.

12:42.553 --> 12:43.971
You are considering it.

12:47.683 --> 12:52.480
A Thirdie on the tribunal?
Mel, that's not gonna be popular in First.

12:53.189 --> 12:56.775
Equal representation
with First and Second. That's the demand.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.652
Are you guys insane?

12:59.653 --> 13:01.947
The Folgers have a lot of power in First.
They'll freak out.

13:02.031 --> 13:05.743
You think we have a class divide now?
This could blow the whole thing up.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.289
Can I borrow you for a second?

13:11.790 --> 13:12.625
Yeah.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.878
Javi, can you take the helm?

13:15.961 --> 13:16.921
Sure.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.437
We haven't done that since the bees died.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.570
I'm sensing a bit of a pattern.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.948
God, I wish I could open
a frigging window.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.744
Do you remember fresh air?

14:36.709 --> 14:37.543
Hmm?

14:40.337 --> 14:41.797
Do you remember...

14:43.841 --> 14:45.593
going for walks?

14:52.141 --> 14:53.142
Rain.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.769
I miss the sound of rain.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.442
I miss so many things.

15:14.830 --> 15:16.582
-Are you gonna do this?

15:18.834 --> 15:20.336
Draw a new tribunal?

15:22.421 --> 15:24.256
I just want to breathe.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.598
Attention, passengers.

16:14.682 --> 16:19.478
Mr. Wilford has accepted
a Third Class petition

16:20.145 --> 16:22.982
<i>to redraw the tribunal for today's trial.</i>

16:24.608 --> 16:29.071
One name has been drawn randomly
from each class.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.699
<i>If your name is called,</i>

16:31.782 --> 16:35.285
please report immediately
to your Hospitality representative.

16:36.245 --> 16:41.458
From First Class,
our jurist is Edith Gusterfeld.

16:41.542 --> 16:45.921
<i>From Second Class,</i>
<i>primary teacher Mary Elizabeth Gillies.</i>

16:46.005 --> 16:52.553
<i>And representing Third Class,</i>
<i>papermaker Walter Flemming.</i>

16:54.096 --> 16:57.057
<i>Again, Edith Gusterfeld,</i>
<i>Mary Elizabeth Gillies...</i>

16:57.141 --> 16:59.059
-Let's go.
<i>-...and Walter Flemming...</i>

16:59.685 --> 17:02.021
-Here goes.
<i>-...please report to Hospitality.</i>

17:03.439 --> 17:05.649
<i>-Thank you.</i>
- Oh, we did it.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.943
Back on Sanitation
in five minutes.

17:09.111 --> 17:12.948
Come on. Come on. I want a break, too.

17:34.595 --> 17:35.679
That's her.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.640
Oh, thank God, you made it.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.144
What did you find out?

17:43.437 --> 17:46.106
There's nothing solid,
but if he's not in the Tail...

17:46.648 --> 17:49.568
- Okay, so where's she going?
-I think I found someone who might help.

17:49.651 --> 17:50.527
Who?

17:50.611 --> 17:52.446
The janitors.
A guy named Terence.

17:52.529 --> 17:54.114
- Here, quick. You got this.
- Pants.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.533
Look, that Jack
can't tell us apart.

17:57.117 --> 18:00.329
I'll be back before the next break.
I promise. Okay?

18:01.163 --> 18:05.084
And you just keep your head down,
all right? We'll watch her back.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.127
-Okay.
- We'll be here.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.505
Where am I going?

18:09.588 --> 18:12.382
The Market. Look for the yellow butterfly.
You'll see it.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.134
Okay. Thank you.

18:14.718 --> 18:15.761
I hope you find him.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.445
Mr. Flemming.

18:34.321 --> 18:37.241
-Mr. Wilford thanks you for your service.
-Yeah.

18:37.324 --> 18:38.700
Please, help yourself.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.497
Not saying hello?

18:43.580 --> 18:45.582
I'm Mary,
the primary teacher.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.167
I ought to thank you for your craft.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.169
-The kids love New Paper Day.
- Oh.

18:49.753 --> 18:53.423
Edith Gusterfeld.
Firstie, but don't hold that against me.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.341
Understood.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.176
- I like your earrings.
- Thank you, dear.

18:57.719 --> 19:02.349
Doesn't Mr. Wilford understand
that you can't just change the rules?

19:02.432 --> 19:04.101
I guess they're his rules to change.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.604
He chose the will of the people.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.440
We don't have will.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.360
We have order.

19:14.319 --> 19:17.781
It's not every day you get
a chance to mingle with other classes.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.207
Third Class delegates,
if you wanna go to the trial,

19:27.291 --> 19:29.543
give me your names and passenger numbers.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.254
- Okay.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.175
Well, congratulations.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.012
You must be happy
now that you're bourgeoisie.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.765
That depends. Are you gonna
extort addicts for sex today?

19:45.142 --> 19:46.894
Come on, man, my probation's over.

19:53.108 --> 19:57.237
Okay, well, I'd like to stay
for Jinju's testimony.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.947
You know, show her some support.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.951
-They're ready uptrain.
-Better get going, then, shouldn't we?

20:05.579 --> 20:08.999
Oi, dirtbags! We're on the march!
Now, listen up!

20:10.500 --> 20:15.505
Listen! Right. Now, you're gonna see some
things uptrain that are unfamiliar to you.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.050
Things like hygiene and self-respect.

20:18.133 --> 20:22.095
You will hear people
speaking in complete sentences.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.555
Now, don't punch them.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.225
Don't punch their belongings.
Don't lick things.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.770
Am I making myself clear?
Now, hands to yourself, eyes forward,

20:29.853 --> 20:32.147
and just remember
who's carrying the batons, okay?

20:32.231 --> 20:36.485
All right, that's enough.
Okay, everyone! In a line, please.

20:37.069 --> 20:41.365
Mrs. Gusterfeld will vote with First.
She'll get the teacher on board.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.575
Don't worry.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.620
You don't see what's happening, do you?

20:49.539 --> 20:52.292
There's an idea traveling uptrain, Robert.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.046
<i>It wants to live, this idea.</i>

20:57.297 --> 21:02.386
<i>It wants to set the train ablaze,</i>
<i>and all it needs is a spark.</i>

21:02.469 --> 21:07.099
All it needs is to wrap its thick fingers
around your daughter's throat

21:07.182 --> 21:10.394
and choke her out for the working man.

21:10.477 --> 21:11.853
What's wrong?

21:12.562 --> 21:13.939
Everything's fine, darling.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.108
You look beautiful.

21:16.733 --> 21:18.610
Let's keep working on your testimony.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.657
Leave the rest to me, Lilah.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.916
<i>Psycho's kill-cult took another...</i>

21:45.262 --> 21:46.930
That psycho's kill-cult took another one.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.141
Not like this.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.518
I can smell them cooking.

21:51.601 --> 21:52.686
They're at the back now against the wall.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.563
Goddamn cannibals.

21:55.188 --> 21:57.107
Come on, Miles. Up you go.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.609
-It'll be all right.
-We need your help.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.611
Put a stop to them now.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.657
Here you are.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.803
Welcome to Third.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.311
She reeks of Sanitation.

23:17.437 --> 23:21.566
So that's how you got out.
Astrid wouldn't say.

23:22.150 --> 23:26.863
Good. We risked this for one reason:
to find Layton.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.198
Is he not back in the Tail?

23:28.740 --> 23:32.619
They're saying he is but, no, he isn't.
We think he's in a drawer.

23:37.958 --> 23:38.875
So, um...

23:41.086 --> 23:45.298
the man comes forward,
solves the biggest crime in train history.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.259
Why would they put him in a drawer?

23:48.301 --> 23:50.303
Maybe he turned over the wrong rock.

23:50.387 --> 23:51.555
Or maybe he's dead.

23:52.305 --> 23:58.645
Maybe he pissed off Wilford and, uh...
got his head stuck out a port, huh?

23:58.728 --> 24:01.857
He's not the dying type. You met him.

24:03.066 --> 24:07.362
Funny... we were just talking
about the Drawers.

24:09.489 --> 24:10.574
Can we get in?

24:10.657 --> 24:15.036
Might not be a bad day for it.
Security's lean 'cause of the trial.

24:17.080 --> 24:20.250
Well... what the hell?

24:20.959 --> 24:22.669
Let's hit the Drawers.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.756
We have no issue
with the good people of Third,

24:26.840 --> 24:28.300
but if all they have to do
is make a bit of noise

24:28.383 --> 24:30.594
and suddenly we're rewriting
the enshrined rules of the train,

24:30.677 --> 24:32.053
then we all have a problem.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.347
With respect, Mr. Folger...

24:35.724 --> 24:40.187
are you speaking as a concerned citizen
or a scared daddy?

24:40.270 --> 24:42.856
-Both.
-We all stand with the Folgers.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.609
As they'd stand with us
if Third came for our children.

24:46.151 --> 24:51.114
My job is to uphold the rules...
not to make them.

24:51.198 --> 24:54.743
Mr. Wilford locked himself away uptrain.
The man is out of touch.

24:54.826 --> 24:58.496
He's got the skills to keep us all alive.
What have you got?

24:58.580 --> 25:00.874
I got 400 million in early investor status

25:00.957 --> 25:03.501
and a whole world of pain
when it comes to my survival.

25:03.585 --> 25:05.420
Please, don't misunderstand us.

25:05.503 --> 25:07.923
May Wilford run his Engine
for as long as the track holds.

25:08.006 --> 25:11.635
But day-to-day operations,
justice, resources...

25:12.969 --> 25:14.054
the Tail.

25:14.804 --> 25:17.057
Maybe these matters
would be better handled here,

25:17.140 --> 25:18.391
where their effects are felt.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.978
And what about Melanie Cavill?

25:26.733 --> 25:28.193
She'd be the first to go.

25:32.864 --> 25:35.533
-So they're talking about sedition.
- Mmm.

25:36.493 --> 25:38.119
How did the Commander respond?

25:39.246 --> 25:42.165
Uh, well, he didn't agree or disagree.

25:42.249 --> 25:49.172
He mostly just stared at us coldly,
which, I won't lie, is very effective.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.094
Don't you need to get to the trial?

25:56.179 --> 25:57.180
I do.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.475
We'll speed up those renovations for you,

26:00.558 --> 26:03.019
and Mr. Wilford thanks you
for your service.

26:16.992 --> 26:19.244
Honey, it's time to go.

26:21.288 --> 26:24.082
-Make eye contact.
-I know.

26:24.165 --> 26:26.418
-Be sincere.
-I know. Trite tears are okay--

26:26.501 --> 26:28.336
-Not trite tears...
-Contrite tears.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.838
Well, I'll be crying them,
not saying them,

26:29.921 --> 26:31.464
so you could just criticize me after.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.174
Come here, my Lilahs.

26:54.904 --> 26:55.822
All rise.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.375
Please settle.

27:09.711 --> 27:11.463
As we are all aware,

27:12.005 --> 27:16.384
tribunals are convened when the order
of our Eternal Engine is threatened...

27:17.093 --> 27:21.181
by crime, conspiracy or negligence.

27:22.724 --> 27:27.228
Lilah Folger Junior,
you stand accused of two counts of murder.

27:29.522 --> 27:30.607
Please be seated.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.235
This tribunal is now in session.

27:38.406 --> 27:40.408
<i>Once the accused</i>
<i>was apprehended,</i>

27:41.076 --> 27:44.579
<i>the Brakemen conducted</i>
<i>a full and thorough search</i>

27:45.121 --> 27:46.873
<i>of the Folgers' quarters.</i>

27:47.874 --> 27:52.337
There, we found
the most striking evidence in the case.

27:58.843 --> 28:02.097
Hidden in Lilah Junior's jewelry box

28:02.889 --> 28:09.771
were the particularly preserved
severed... penises of two male victims.

28:12.232 --> 28:16.861
Sean Wise was bound and choked
multiple times with a thin ligature.

28:17.570 --> 28:21.449
He was very much alive
when his genitals were...

28:22.659 --> 28:24.744
-chopped off.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.997
It was nothing you ever want to see.

28:29.290 --> 28:31.751
He was staring back at me
through the cold.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.504
Limbless and...

28:37.173 --> 28:38.299
and dickless.

28:39.551 --> 28:43.304
The whole time,
Erik's focus was Lilah Junior.

28:43.388 --> 28:46.015
I was as much her hostage as I was his.

28:54.023 --> 28:59.487
That was what they wanted, Erik and LJ,
to kill us all in a nihilistic rage.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.659
But the Eternal Engine is still here.

29:07.287 --> 29:11.458
<i>We will now hear</i>
<i>from Miss Audrey of the Nightcar,</i>

29:12.333 --> 29:14.502
speaking on behalf of one of the victims.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.467
I will tell the whole truth.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.138
Her name was not "victim."

29:26.181 --> 29:29.684
Her name was Nicolette Genêt. Nikki.

29:30.769 --> 29:34.189
She sang off-key,
and she was kind as a rule,

29:34.272 --> 29:36.107
but few of you care up here.

29:36.191 --> 29:38.985
To you, she's just some dead girl
from downtrain.

29:39.527 --> 29:43.823
Well, you need to care
about the lives of Third.

29:44.449 --> 29:47.827
Because seven days a week,
three shifts a day,

29:47.911 --> 29:51.039
we keep the bearings greased
and the cold at bay.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.958
We draw straws to have children,

29:54.042 --> 29:59.088
and we die from preventable accidents
and diseases you get treatment for.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.343
I haven't come to this place easily.

30:04.010 --> 30:08.807
When we left Chicago, we needed
Mr. Wilford's iron order to survive.

30:09.390 --> 30:13.436
But almost 19 revolutions later,

30:14.479 --> 30:16.231
seven years,

30:16.731 --> 30:22.654
I know all of you,
and I know we need to save our souls.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.616
Find your compassion.

30:27.325 --> 30:31.120
Send a message to this entire train
that justice is not reserved for the rich.

30:31.204 --> 30:34.833
There can be justice for all. For Nikki.

30:35.625 --> 30:36.751
Her name was Nikki.

30:41.756 --> 30:43.591
- Order.

30:47.053 --> 30:49.138
Order, please!

30:50.265 --> 30:53.434
We will take a brief recess,
and when we return,

30:53.518 --> 30:55.228
we will hear from the accused.

30:59.190 --> 31:02.318
Oh, Doctor, can I swab the floor
for the prisoners?

31:02.402 --> 31:04.445
No, it's okay.
I want to get back to the trial.

31:04.529 --> 31:08.366
Oh, yeah. Poor girl.
Were you listening? Sorry.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.160
It's heartbreaking.

31:11.244 --> 31:12.996
Thank you. Yes, it really is.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.301
Come on. Come on.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.641
Come on.

31:38.771 --> 31:40.607
Hello, you poor buggers.

31:41.774 --> 31:44.193
-Which one's he in?
-Figure it out.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.155
Shit.

31:50.533 --> 31:53.161
There's gotta be a list here somewhere.

31:57.081 --> 31:58.791
Come on. Quick.

32:11.262 --> 32:14.015
-What's that? Where are you going?
-Sorry, Tailie.

32:14.807 --> 32:18.686
You're robbing the place.
Can you help me find him, please?

32:18.770 --> 32:22.231
Don't take this personally, huh?
And don't get caught.

32:22.857 --> 32:24.984
-No, wait. Wait!
- Gotta go.

32:28.446 --> 32:29.364
Shit.

32:37.038 --> 32:37.997
Lilah,

32:38.665 --> 32:43.461
whatever you're doing
behind closed doors... don't.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.134
Let me tell you a Folger family story.

32:51.427 --> 32:54.973
When LJ was seven,
she put out Robert's eye.

32:56.265 --> 33:00.019
Lashed out with a fork,
and punctured it all over his face.

33:01.062 --> 33:04.190
And even as the jelly
was running down his cheek,

33:04.273 --> 33:08.903
he held her through the tantrum,
protecting her.

33:10.279 --> 33:15.618
So, you go ahead with
your Hospitality show trial, and...

33:16.452 --> 33:18.746
prepare to suffer the consequences.

33:21.541 --> 33:24.002
Because you're fucking with my bloodline.

33:29.799 --> 33:30.800
Excuse me.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.021
Where are you, Layton?

33:45.314 --> 33:46.482
Where are you?

33:50.528 --> 33:52.071
I swear to tell the truth.

34:00.913 --> 34:03.291
I... I loved Erik Sotto.

34:06.002 --> 34:08.379
Or at least I think I did.

34:09.547 --> 34:14.010
The confusion. The ache in my guts.

34:15.011 --> 34:17.764
The fear. That is love, isn't it?

34:20.099 --> 34:22.268
Erik told me it was.

34:27.982 --> 34:30.651
Erik had a power over me, and I...

34:32.070 --> 34:35.156
He made me watch him do terrible things.

34:35.740 --> 34:38.409
And I can still hear those men...

34:39.869 --> 34:42.455
begging for it to end.

34:44.707 --> 34:45.541
Uh...

34:46.167 --> 34:50.046
But Erik said fear makes people honest.

34:50.797 --> 34:52.340
I think that's true.

34:54.592 --> 35:00.014
Sean Wise, just before he died,
said that he was an informant.

35:01.724 --> 35:03.184
A spy for Mr. Wilford.

35:03.267 --> 35:04.602
Shit.

35:06.354 --> 35:11.192
Sean said that shadows and lies
were taking over our beautiful train,

35:11.275 --> 35:15.613
from tip to Tail,
from Ag-Sec to the Drawers.

35:16.572 --> 35:20.618
<i>"Four hundred secrets</i>
<i>that'd rock us to the rails," he said.</i>

35:20.701 --> 35:22.203
But he would never spill them.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.127
Mia?

35:32.880 --> 35:35.174
Mia? Oh, my God.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.510
Can I say this part to Mr. Wilford?

35:39.637 --> 35:41.347
Yes, he's following along.

35:47.019 --> 35:52.650
I am so sorry for the part
that I played in this tragedy.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.611
I was silent when I should have spoken.

35:57.029 --> 35:58.865
But Sean Wise gave his life

35:58.948 --> 36:01.075
<i>to save humanity</i>
<i>from the darkness</i>

36:01.159 --> 36:03.661
<i>that almost swallowed me whole.</i>

36:04.453 --> 36:06.747
No, no. No, no, no.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.626
If the train shows me mercy...

36:15.089 --> 36:17.550
I promise to do my part for her, too.

36:22.597 --> 36:23.681
That's all I can say.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.184
All rise.

36:27.393 --> 36:30.521
The tribunal will now break to deliberate.

36:48.497 --> 36:49.498
Layton.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.467
What the hell was that?

37:00.051 --> 37:01.469
I don't know.

37:02.511 --> 37:03.429
I mean...

37:05.973 --> 37:08.768
Maybe Sean found out
the Drawers are experimental.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.438
Maybe he told her about the list.

37:12.521 --> 37:14.357
Well, that changes the calculus,
doesn't it?

37:50.101 --> 37:53.020
This is all her fault, from the beginning.
I shouldn't even be here, man.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.982
Shut up, Javier. You have another option?

37:56.065 --> 37:56.899
No.

37:58.776 --> 37:59.902
No, I don't.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.655
I'm not sleeping with her, am I?

38:08.995 --> 38:09.996
Layton.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.582
Layton, I'm here. Layton.

38:26.220 --> 38:30.933
Layton. Layton. Layton, I'm here.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.770
Oh! Sweet smell of Second Class corridors.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.398
Your new bridal home, eh?

38:39.150 --> 38:43.154
Come for dinner. Second Class rations
get dessert every night.

38:45.740 --> 38:46.741
What?

39:08.888 --> 39:10.056
Osweiller.

39:25.488 --> 39:27.114
- Layton.
-She's a Tailie!

39:29.909 --> 39:32.411
Oz! Oz, get off her!

39:37.416 --> 39:40.294
-You're Till, right? Layton?
- Why is he in here?

39:40.378 --> 39:42.838
-His heartbeat's barely there.
-He's supposed to be in the Tail.

39:46.425 --> 39:48.135
Layton, wake up.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.180
-Layton? Layton. Layton, can you hear me?

39:51.263 --> 39:56.936
Layton. Layton. It's me.
Layton. Layton. Layton. Layton.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.939
We gotta get outta here now.

40:00.022 --> 40:02.858
-Order. Quiet, please.

40:08.155 --> 40:12.326
Lilah Folger Junior, the tribunal
will now announce your verdict.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.997
By unanimous decision...

40:18.249 --> 40:21.961
we find Lilah Folger Junior...

40:23.045 --> 40:25.047
guilty on all counts.

40:53.033 --> 40:57.746
There's no choice.
It's what she asked for in the worst case.

40:58.706 --> 41:02.501
She should have left it.
She should have just left it alone.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.435
- Order. Order.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.607
Order, everyone!

41:25.274 --> 41:27.109
We have a message from Mr. Wilford.

41:33.365 --> 41:35.659
In light of the young age
of the accused...

41:38.662 --> 41:42.041
Mr. Wilford commutes the sentence
of Lilah Folger Junior

41:42.124 --> 41:44.793
and remands her
to the custody of her parents.

41:49.131 --> 41:49.965
You're free.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.468
- Please, calm down!
-Yes. Yes.

41:53.385 --> 41:56.138
- Order! Order, please!

41:56.722 --> 41:58.390
Everyone remain calm!

42:01.477 --> 42:06.357
Please remain calm.
This trial is over. Please remain calm.

42:25.501 --> 42:27.294
-All right, this is as far as I go.
- What?

42:27.378 --> 42:29.129
-Now I gotta go.
-Where are you going?

42:29.213 --> 42:31.257
-I gotta go.
-Where is it?

42:31.340 --> 42:32.841
Keep going. She's down there.

42:33.842 --> 42:34.927
Come on, Layton.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.015
I've got you. I've got you.

42:46.730 --> 42:47.773
Josie.

42:49.858 --> 42:53.529
- You need to hide him.
-What's wrong with him?

42:54.154 --> 42:55.531
They drawered him.

42:59.410 --> 43:04.081
Don't give up on me now, okay?
I'll be back. I'll be back. I'll be back.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.166
How'd you get out of the Tail?

43:12.298 --> 43:14.550
The Tail needs to trust you, Zarah.

43:16.176 --> 43:17.344
I'll look after him.

43:24.435 --> 43:25.436
Come on, Layton.

43:26.979 --> 43:29.273
-Gotta get you upstairs.

43:32.151 --> 43:34.695
Before I release you to your parents...

43:37.323 --> 43:43.245
Mr. Wilford has asked me to stress...
the importance of discretion.

43:43.329 --> 43:44.455
Oh.

43:44.538 --> 43:46.832
Oh, so don't spill all his Drawer secrets?

43:50.419 --> 43:53.714
What did Sean Wise tell you, exactly?

43:55.341 --> 43:57.843
That's between me
and Mr. Wilford, isn't it?

44:00.971 --> 44:03.849
He has taken an extraordinary risk
in helping you.

44:04.683 --> 44:08.062
Third Class? I think they'll get over it.

44:08.979 --> 44:11.690
I mean you, LJ.

44:14.068 --> 44:16.028
I mean letting you walk free.

44:22.201 --> 44:23.952
Wilford looked out for me,

44:25.371 --> 44:28.832
so... I'll look out for him.

44:33.629 --> 44:34.922
Can I go now?

44:55.275 --> 44:59.655
Daddy! It's over. It's all over.

45:03.367 --> 45:04.952
-What a nightmare.
- You're safe.

45:06.370 --> 45:07.621
I love you.

45:12.459 --> 45:13.460
Osweiller?

45:16.630 --> 45:17.631
Shit.

45:54.918 --> 45:56.128
Never again.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.922
Never again.

46:01.091 --> 46:02.092
Never again.
