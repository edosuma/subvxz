10:05.872 --> 10:08.239
I'm sure you are aware
that my daddy

10:08.241 --> 10:10.875
Is the largest donor
to this university's endowment.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.578
I would not get personal
with me, sweetheart.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.113
I don't fight fair.

10:19.586 --> 10:22.587
I may not be able
to revoke its charter today,

10:22.589 --> 10:24.589
But there is no
way that kappa,

10:24.591 --> 10:26.591
At least the way
it's constituted now,

10:26.593 --> 10:28.126
Is surviving the year.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.796
You know what,
i could not agree with you more.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.999
May i make a suggestion?

10:38.572 --> 10:40.271
Man:
<i>I, uh, i made a playlist</i>

10:40.273 --> 10:42.140
For the ride.
Check it out.
Let me see.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.776
Oh, let me guess,
"grace college drive"?

10:44.778 --> 10:47.245
You're so literal.
I just hope it's not maudlin.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.747
Big word, college girl.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.316
("a thousand years"
by christina perri playing)

10:52.252 --> 10:54.753
Dad, are you kidding?

10:54.755 --> 10:56.921
♪ ooh... ♪
(laughs)

10:56.923 --> 10:59.257
♪ ooh... ♪

10:59.259 --> 11:01.126
What? I am sentimental.

11:01.128 --> 11:04.095
You know, when i took you to
see<i> twilight</i> in the theater,

11:04.097 --> 11:06.765
It was your first
pg-13 movie.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.633
Come on.

11:08.635 --> 11:09.801
Team...

11:09.803 --> 11:13.104
Edward. Edward. Yes.
(laughs)
edward. Team edward.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.940
Look, i'm-i'm totally freaking
out about all this, okay?

11:15.942 --> 11:19.644
Y-you're all i got, gracie.
No pressure or anything.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.780
And i know this... I know
this makes me a loser,

11:21.782 --> 11:23.615
But, uh...

11:23.617 --> 11:25.784
You're my best friend.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.819
Well, it does make you a loser.

11:27.821 --> 11:30.955
Look, dad,
i'm really gonna be fine.

11:30.957 --> 11:33.124
I went online,
and wallace university is

11:33.126 --> 11:34.993
One of the safest campuses
in the nation.

11:34.995 --> 11:38.196
I-i know, okay? I'm-i'm... I'm
gonna ask you one more time.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.198
Dad...
Please don't
join a sorority.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.133
Dad, we already talked
about this.
Look, girls are vicious, okay?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.968
And i know you think
sororities are some kind of,

11:43.970 --> 11:45.136
Like, magical sisterhood,

11:45.138 --> 11:47.138
But it's actually
<i>game of thrones</i>

11:47.140 --> 11:48.807
Once you pull
back the veneer.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.975
Dad, mom died
when i was two years old, okay?

11:50.977 --> 11:52.811
I don't have
any of my own memories.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.813
I've got the stories
that you tell me

11:54.815 --> 11:57.649
And a few old photographs
that survived the fire

11:57.651 --> 11:59.217
And this.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.155
You know,
there's that one photo of her

12:04.157 --> 12:06.858
In the sorority house,
and she's with her sisters,

12:06.860 --> 12:08.827
And she just looks so happy.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.996
Every time i've pictured her,
it's with this pin

12:11.998 --> 12:15.900
On her formal dress
and a big smile on her face.

12:15.902 --> 12:18.002
I just feel like

12:18.004 --> 12:19.237
If i join kappa,

12:19.239 --> 12:21.673
It'll be like
i'm following in her footsteps.

12:21.675 --> 12:24.008
And how many other chances
am i gonna have

12:24.010 --> 12:26.211
To feel close to her like that?

12:26.213 --> 12:28.279
♪ ♪

12:54.374 --> 12:56.040
(sighs)

12:56.042 --> 12:58.409
Okay, so, um...

12:58.411 --> 13:00.044
You ready?

13:00.046 --> 13:02.914
Just like we planned.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.884
Three-second silent hug,
and then you leave.

13:05.886 --> 13:07.886
And-and no eye contact.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.120
Right.
Okay.

13:11.725 --> 13:13.224
(panting)
one.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.326
Two.

13:17.230 --> 13:19.130
Three.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.800
(clears throat)

13:28.942 --> 13:31.009
(sighs)

13:35.248 --> 13:38.750
Ooh, somebody call csi,
because there was a murder scene

13:38.752 --> 13:41.085
In that bathroom.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.321
Hi. I'm zayday.
I'm your roommate.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.323
Uh, hi. I'm-i'm grace.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.425
And what-what's wrong
with the bathroom?

13:47.427 --> 13:48.927
Someone puked in the sink,

13:48.929 --> 13:50.995
And i'm pretty sure
i saw an actual ringworm

13:50.997 --> 13:52.263
Climbing up the wall.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.798
I'm not afraid
of anything,

13:53.800 --> 13:55.099
But that bathroom
scared the crap out of me.

13:55.101 --> 13:56.301
(chuckles)

13:56.303 --> 13:58.336
I've got to get out
of this dorm room.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.004
Was that your dad
who ran out crying before?

14:00.006 --> 14:03.107
Yeah. I know,
it's, like, super dorky,

14:03.109 --> 14:04.776
But we're really close.

14:04.778 --> 14:06.010
Oh. Where's your mom?

14:07.280 --> 14:09.314
Grace:<i> She died</i>
<i>when i was really little,</i>

14:09.316 --> 14:11.449
So i don't really
remember her.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.351
My mom was mostly
out the picture, too.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.854
I was raised by my grandma,
who told me every day,

14:15.856 --> 14:17.288
If i really, really
applied myself,

14:17.290 --> 14:18.790
I could get out of oakland

14:18.792 --> 14:20.458
And grow up to be the first
black woman president.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.960
And here you are.
That's amazing.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.962
Yeah, except
she was serious.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.997
My grandma ain't no joke.
She like tiger woods' daddy.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.466
Trying to make me golf
and everything.
(laughs)

14:28.468 --> 14:31.169
Girl, i was terrified i was
gonna get some religious freak

14:31.171 --> 14:33.137
Or a cutter for a roommate,
but you're dope.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.807
Well, i don't think i'm gonna
be in the room for very long.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.141
I'm rushing
kappa kappa tau.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.810
Hey, why don't
you join with me?

14:38.812 --> 14:40.478
Girl, i'd rather die.
Ooh, come on.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.881
This is gonna be a year
of infinite possibilities.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.315
I can feel it.

14:44.317 --> 14:46.985
And if you are serious about
becoming president someday,

14:46.987 --> 14:50.388
Becoming president of kappa
is not a bad place to start.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.190
Actually, you make
a good point.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.525
Women:

Cindy mccain is pretty much

15:46.947 --> 15:48.913
Who i want to be
when i grow up.
Me, too.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.049
Or megyn kelly.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.384
Hold this.
It's too heavy.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.386
Your role models are awesome,
and you're legacies,

15:55.388 --> 15:58.222
So you're a total lock
to get in. (chuckles)

15:58.224 --> 15:59.524
(clinking on glass)

16:00.894 --> 16:02.460
Sisters, potential pledges,

16:02.462 --> 16:04.228
I have an important
announcement to make.

16:04.230 --> 16:07.465
I am bursting
like a piece of freshen-up.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.600
(laughs)
anyway,

16:09.602 --> 16:11.602
Dean munsch and i
were talking about

16:11.604 --> 16:13.571
How to bring kappa kappa tau

16:13.573 --> 16:15.106
Into the 21st century.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.441
Now,

16:16.443 --> 16:18.409
What's cool these days is

16:18.411 --> 16:20.278
A global community
free of cliques...

16:20.280 --> 16:21.579
Let's cut to the chase.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.948
This year,
kappa will be required

16:23.950 --> 16:25.950
To accept anyone

16:25.952 --> 16:27.085
Who wishes to
become a pledge.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.420
(gasping, murmuring)

16:29.422 --> 16:30.488
Things just got
interesting.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.090
(stammering):
I'm in? I'm in?

16:32.092 --> 16:33.424
Yeah, you in, girl.
You in.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.492
Munsch:
If you're enrolled

16:34.494 --> 16:36.961
At this university, you are free

16:36.963 --> 16:39.330
To become a pledge
at kappa kappa tau.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.100
The doors are open

16:42.102 --> 16:45.269
To the public.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.138
(murmuring)

16:47.140 --> 16:48.306
Don't!

16:48.308 --> 16:50.341
(panting)

16:53.013 --> 16:54.645
You can't do this!

16:54.647 --> 16:56.581
(chuckles)

17:01.654 --> 17:04.022
(door opens)

17:05.458 --> 17:07.458
You didn't knock!

17:07.460 --> 17:08.626
You know what
that means.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.094
Rules are rules.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.533
Thank you. Now, what is it?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.535
You have to come downstairs.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.537
Now.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.539
Chanel:
<i>This is a total nightmare.</i>
(grunts)

17:21.541 --> 17:24.475
<i>If this is our pledge class,</i>
<i>i'm killing myself.</i>

17:24.477 --> 17:26.310
<i>And then munsch.</i>

17:26.312 --> 17:28.212
<i>Look at them.</i>
<i>They're the dregs of society.</i>

17:28.214 --> 17:29.480
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

17:29.482 --> 17:31.983
<i>Each one of these gashes</i>
<i>is worse than the next.</i>

17:31.985 --> 17:33.217
I spent the last two weeks

17:33.219 --> 17:35.153
Learning the whole history
of kappa kappa tau.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.556
It was founded in 1837 at miami
university in oxford, ohio.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.658
Chanel:
<i>Neckbrace.</i>

17:40.660 --> 17:43.161
<i>Real name: Hester ulrich,</i>
<i>history major.</i>

17:43.163 --> 17:45.530
<i>She smells like hot dog water,</i>
<i>and probably sprained her neck</i>

17:45.532 --> 17:47.665
<i>Giving blumpkins down at</i>
<i>the local bowling alley.</i>

17:47.667 --> 17:50.168
I love taylor swift.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.503
I know the lyrics
to every one of her songs,

17:52.505 --> 17:55.173
And i don't let the fact
that i'm deaf stop me

17:55.175 --> 17:57.175
From singing them
at the top of my lungs

17:57.177 --> 17:58.342
Whenever i get the chance.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.044
Chanel:
<i>Deaf taylor swift.</i>

18:00.046 --> 18:01.546
<i>Real name: Tiffany something.</i>

18:01.548 --> 18:04.182
<i>And like all deaf people,</i>
<i>she has horrible halitosis.</i>

18:04.184 --> 18:07.018
Look, i'm not saying that
all heterosexual sex is rape.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.353
I'm saying all heterosexual sex
is gross,

18:09.355 --> 18:11.189
And that deep down,
every woman knows this.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.191
Chanel:
<i>Predatory lez.</i>

18:13.193 --> 18:15.193
<i>Real name:</i>
<i>Mac or butch or something.</i>

18:15.195 --> 18:17.528
<i>Two days ago, i caught her</i>
<i>staring at my ass on the quad.</i>

18:17.530 --> 18:20.064
<i>All that girl's after is</i>
<i>a whole lot of bikini burger.</i>

18:20.066 --> 18:21.499
I feel you.

18:23.436 --> 18:27.205
Hey, girl, can i just ask you,
what's up with your outfit?

18:27.207 --> 18:30.608
My therapist says
i had a traumatic experience

18:30.610 --> 18:34.212
That kept part of my psyche
forever trapped in the '90s.

18:34.214 --> 18:36.247
But i'm, like,
uh, i'll take it.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.749
Chanel:
<i>And then there's those two.</i>

18:38.751 --> 18:41.719
<i>God knows what they're</i>
<i>talking about, basic bitches.</i>

18:41.721 --> 18:44.155
(door bell rings)
what fresh hell is this?

18:51.064 --> 18:54.232
Chanel, i'd like
to introduce you to jennifer.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.566
I'm sorry,
kappa doesn't participate

18:55.568 --> 18:57.101
In the make-a-wish foundation.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.169
Oh, but you do now.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.404
Jennifer here is a sophomore.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.240
I found her sitting
alone in the library

19:02.242 --> 19:03.241
Without a friend in the world,

19:03.243 --> 19:05.076
Which leads me
to you, chanel.

19:05.078 --> 19:07.111
Jennifer here is
your new pledge.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.113
Jennifer, why don't you
tell chanel

19:09.115 --> 19:11.082
A little bit
about your interests?

19:11.084 --> 19:12.416
I'm a candle vlogger.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.418
What the hell is that?

19:14.420 --> 19:17.088
You guys, i love this one.

19:17.090 --> 19:19.757
I got it at bath & body works,
half off.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.659
I call it
the nancy meyers experience,

19:21.661 --> 19:23.161
Because when you burn it,

19:23.163 --> 19:25.663
It smells like creamy couches
and menopause.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.598
You know,
like a nancy meyers movie.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.433
(echoing):
Four stars.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.769
(sniffing)

19:31.771 --> 19:34.372
(screaming)

19:35.341 --> 19:36.774
(groans)

19:36.776 --> 19:39.143
Look, i don't know
what to tell you, chanel.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.312
If kappa's suddenly filled
with weirdos and fatties,

19:41.314 --> 19:43.314
There is literally no way
you can be popular.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.448
And i need you to stay popular,

19:44.450 --> 19:46.284
'cause if you want
to stay at the top

19:46.286 --> 19:48.319
Of the list of the pieces of ass
i'm getting, there's criteria.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.820
And the criteria is
you got to be popular.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.522
But, chad...

19:51.524 --> 19:53.624
Chad.
Okay, i'm gonna
stop you right there,

19:53.626 --> 19:55.626
Because i'm getting
really pissed off.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.695
Chad is an amazing person.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.297
Chad radwell is

19:59.299 --> 20:00.698
The president of the
dickie dollar scholars,

20:00.700 --> 20:03.601
And he's super hot, and
he doesn't have time for this.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.704
Are-are you
fake crying?

20:06.706 --> 20:07.805
Stop fake crying.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.473
When you fake cry,
you are so not hot. Ugh.

20:09.475 --> 20:12.543
I just think
you are amazing, chad.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.345
Anyone you dated
would be popular.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.813
I mean, they would be popular

20:15.815 --> 20:17.315
Because they're dating you.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.317
Okay. Boone.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.319
Thank you.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.321
Look, chanel, i'm
a psychology major,

20:23.323 --> 20:25.223
So i'm gonna break this down

20:25.225 --> 20:26.557
Into terms
that you'll understand.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.160
My ego-- it's super strong.

20:29.162 --> 20:30.361
Okay, but it's not strong enough

20:30.363 --> 20:32.496
That i can just go around
dating garbage people.

20:32.498 --> 20:34.232
Like, yes, i could
find a random girl

20:34.234 --> 20:35.566
Who wasn't popular, and, yes,

20:35.568 --> 20:38.236
If i started dating her,
she would then become popular.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.672
Dude, that is great idea
for a movie.

20:41.674 --> 20:43.174
Somebody should make that movie.
I would see that movie.

20:43.176 --> 20:46.344
Me, too. You know who
should direct that movie?

20:46.346 --> 20:49.280
Michael bay, the greatest
director of all time.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.218
But i can't go
date a girl

20:54.220 --> 20:56.687
Who was popular and then
she just stopped being popular.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.522
Because that would be crazy.

20:58.524 --> 21:01.525
It's crazy, and nobody's
gonna go see that movie.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.361
Do you know why nobody's gonna
go see that movie?

21:03.363 --> 21:05.363
I...

21:05.365 --> 21:07.765
'cause it never got made.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.233
But you said you loved me.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.534
I do sort of love you.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.270
I just... I would love you
a lot more

21:12.272 --> 21:13.471
If other people loved you, too.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.774
(sighs)
listen,

21:16.776 --> 21:19.710
I can't date a garbage person,
chanel.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.912
I won't. I'm not gonna
do that to myself.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.547
Uh, i need you to leave.

21:23.549 --> 21:25.416
Okay, i need you to leave
because you're bumming me out,

21:25.418 --> 21:26.550
And you're bumming boone out.

21:26.552 --> 21:28.219
(chanel scoffs)

21:28.221 --> 21:29.387
And we're just trying
to have a nice day

21:29.389 --> 21:31.322
Hitting golf balls at hippies.

21:33.259 --> 21:35.326
Cross swords, bro.

21:37.263 --> 21:38.796
Good-bye.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.268
Man (in distance):
You guys, support human rights.

21:44.270 --> 21:45.569
Amnesty international.

21:45.571 --> 21:46.637
(grunts)

21:47.573 --> 21:49.573
Oh, hi, ms. Bean.
What are you doing?

21:49.575 --> 21:51.742
(groans):
Oh. Oh.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.644
You told me to
scrub all the floors

21:53.646 --> 21:55.579
In the house with
a barbie toothbrush.

21:55.581 --> 21:58.783
Ms. Bean, this sorority is
for pretty girls only.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.584
Pretty girls, like you and me.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.586
Now, i have a plan
to keep it that way,

22:02.588 --> 22:04.822
And you're a part
of that plan.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.590
Chanel: If dean munsch
gets her way,

22:06.592 --> 22:08.592
Kappa's gonna be filled
with fatties and ethnics.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.494
The fatties will bring
their big old appetites,

22:10.496 --> 22:12.663
And you know what those
ethnics will bring with them?

22:12.665 --> 22:14.465
Weird spices from
their home countries.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.767
That is a nuclear combination,
ms. Bean.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.602
The weird ethnic spices
will send the fatties

22:18.604 --> 22:20.604
Racing to the bathroom
to blow liquid fire

22:20.606 --> 22:22.440
Out of their huge,
swollen bowels.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.841
Think of the splash back.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.776
Think of the undersides
of all of the toilets

22:25.778 --> 22:27.611
That you're gonna have
to sanitize, ms. Bean.

22:27.613 --> 22:28.779
I don't want that.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.614
I don't want
that for you.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.683
Here you go.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.289
Uh, welcome to the grind.
What can i get started for you?

22:38.291 --> 22:39.990
You don't want
anything, do you?
(muttering)

22:39.992 --> 22:43.294
I'll have a trenta, no-foam,
five-shot half-caf, no foam,

22:43.296 --> 22:46.630
Pumpkin spice latte with
no foam at 210 degrees.

22:46.632 --> 22:49.667
First of all,
that's really hot.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.969
That's two degrees
below boiling.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.637
I'm sorry,
did i enter a wormhole

22:53.639 --> 22:55.473
To a universe
where this coffeehouse

22:55.475 --> 22:56.874
Does not possess
the technology to heat

22:56.876 --> 22:58.976
My favorite autumnal
tradition to 210 degrees?

22:58.978 --> 23:02.646
I like my pumpkin spice
lattes extra hot,

23:02.648 --> 23:04.482
So please comply
with my request.

23:04.484 --> 23:07.818
But extra hot
is 170 degrees.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.820
I'm sorry,
does your job description

23:09.822 --> 23:11.655
Entail arguing with
your customers, thereby

23:11.657 --> 23:13.824
Delaying the moment at which
they receive the irresistible,

23:13.826 --> 23:16.660
Nutmeggy sweetness of
the extra hot, no foam,

23:16.662 --> 23:18.662
Pumpkin spice latte they've been
thinking about all day?

23:18.664 --> 23:19.663
I mean, god!

23:19.665 --> 23:21.699
Ma'am, what would you like?

23:21.701 --> 23:23.667
She doesn't want anything!
She wants you

23:23.669 --> 23:25.536
To start making my
extra hot, no foam,

23:25.538 --> 23:27.838
Pumpkin spice latte!

23:27.840 --> 23:29.540
(scoffs)
so, anyway, since we can't

23:29.542 --> 23:30.875
Turn the castoff
pledges away,

23:30.877 --> 23:32.576
We're gonna have to
scare them off.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.045
That's why i'm gonna
burn your face off.
What?

23:35.047 --> 23:37.047
(sighs) not for real,
silly, it'll be pretend.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.916
So here's the skinny.
We're gonna get

23:38.918 --> 23:40.584
In a fight, and i'm
gonna dunk your head

23:40.586 --> 23:42.853
In the deep fryer.
What? No!

23:42.855 --> 23:45.022
The oil won't be hot. We'll
turn off the machine, idiot.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.057
Oh.
You'll just pretend and
come up all screaming,

23:47.059 --> 23:49.427
And i guarantee all those
newbies will run screaming

23:49.429 --> 23:51.362
Into the night and go pledge
some other sorority.

23:51.364 --> 23:52.563
Sound like a plan?

23:52.565 --> 23:55.599
Right, one 210-degree,
trenta, five-shot,

23:55.601 --> 23:57.535
No foam, pumpkin spice,

23:57.537 --> 24:01.038
Half-caf, no foam latte
for chanel.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.474
Thank you, coffee donkey.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.945
Ugh! You burned the milk!

24:07.947 --> 24:09.713
Learn to make a
pumpkin spice latte,

24:09.715 --> 24:11.415
You psychopath.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.984
Next time, i get you fired,
or worse.

24:15.555 --> 24:17.621
Other barista!

24:18.758 --> 24:20.724
(sighs)

24:20.726 --> 24:22.960
Welcome to the grind.
How may i help you?

24:22.962 --> 24:26.564
Pumpkin spice latte, please.
I want it freezing though.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.399
(laughs)

24:28.401 --> 24:29.767
Actually, i just want
a regular coffee.

24:29.769 --> 24:32.436
Those white girl
pumpkin spice lattes annoy me.

24:32.438 --> 24:34.405
I'm in love.
(laughs)

24:34.407 --> 24:35.573
Name?

24:35.575 --> 24:37.174
Señorita awesome.

24:38.411 --> 24:40.611
You got it,

24:40.613 --> 24:42.413
Señorita awesome.

24:42.415 --> 24:46.584
Look, uh, sorry about that girl
who went all latte-psycho on me.

24:46.586 --> 24:49.086
Her name's chanel; she's
president of the kappa house.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.922
And she thinks that means her
poop smells like ginger beer.

24:51.924 --> 24:54.124
I know her.

24:54.126 --> 24:57.094
I-i mean, i just met her.
I'm pledging kappa.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.929
You don't seem the type.

24:58.931 --> 25:01.999
Well, clearly, you haven't
discovered the many layers

25:02.001 --> 25:04.068
Of señorita awesome.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.440
Señorita awesome,
wait up.

25:09.442 --> 25:11.509
Oh, it's grace,
actually.

25:11.511 --> 25:13.010
Grace, pete.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.945
Look, you can't
join kappa house.

25:14.947 --> 25:16.981
I don't just work as a barista,
i'm also the editor

25:16.983 --> 25:18.148
Of the school paper,
<i>the sentinel.</i>

25:18.150 --> 25:19.950
I like to think
of myself, uh,

25:19.952 --> 25:21.519
As an investigative
reporter.

25:21.521 --> 25:24.121
Anyway, i think at their cores,
all these sororities are evil,

25:24.123 --> 25:27.124
But that house
is truly dangerous.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.793
Excuse me, but i think you're
getting a little too close

25:29.795 --> 25:33.130
To my new pledge,
mr. Convicted sex offender.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.798
Ms. Bean,

25:34.800 --> 25:35.966
Go organize the trash.

25:35.968 --> 25:37.501
I'm sorry, wh-what is
she talking about?

25:37.503 --> 25:39.136
Gay jimmy olsen
over here got a little

25:39.138 --> 25:41.138
Obsessed with me last year.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.140
I still have the 15,000
text messages he sent me.

25:43.142 --> 25:44.808
I had to get
a restraining order.

25:44.810 --> 25:46.844
I was a freshman and
i had a crush, okay?

25:46.846 --> 25:48.979
I tend to get a bit
passionate about things.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.482
Look, you intentionally
led me on.

25:51.484 --> 25:53.484
You kept acting like
you liked me just so you could

25:53.486 --> 25:54.985
Humiliate me.
What was i supposed to do?

25:54.987 --> 25:56.820
<i>True tori</i> was over,
i was bored.

25:56.822 --> 25:59.590
Ms. Bean,
let's hit it!

26:04.830 --> 26:06.830
(shouting): Ms. Bean,
i said let's hit it!

26:06.832 --> 26:08.999
Grace, please don't do this.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.635
I'll be fine.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.905
It was nice to meet you, pete.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.021
Let's do this.

26:31.023 --> 26:33.090
♪ ♪

26:39.231 --> 26:41.231
(knocking)

26:41.233 --> 26:43.601
Enter, ye who dare.

26:44.537 --> 26:45.903
We have some bad news.

26:45.905 --> 26:47.204
We found something.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.872
Number two came up
to ask ms. Bean

26:48.874 --> 26:50.207
If she had a
bigger punch bowl,

26:50.209 --> 26:51.642
And she noticed
her bedroom door was open.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.653
I love a creepy collage.

27:16.235 --> 27:19.236
Okay, so you all want to be
kappas, is that right?

27:19.238 --> 27:22.573
Well, you're about to learn
what being a kappa is all about.

27:22.575 --> 27:24.575
It's about kicking
the living crap out of someone

27:24.577 --> 27:26.644
When they disrespect you.
Follow me!

27:37.089 --> 27:39.123
Hey, white mammy,

27:39.125 --> 27:41.925
You're about to get
your ass handed to you.

27:41.927 --> 27:43.761
I was just in your room,
where i noticed you have

27:43.763 --> 27:46.163
A sizeable shrine
with evil burning candles,

27:46.165 --> 27:48.265
Photos of me with my
face scratched out

27:48.267 --> 27:49.667
And pairs of my stolen panties.

27:49.669 --> 27:51.268
Care to explain,
chubby old nazi?

27:51.270 --> 27:53.937
Chanel, i don't know
what you're talking about.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.273
Now i know why all your
food tastes like it's got

27:56.275 --> 27:57.608
A little bit of pee in it.

27:57.610 --> 27:58.809
You know, ladies,
ms. Bean and i

27:58.811 --> 28:00.277
Had arranged a little prank

28:00.279 --> 28:02.112
Where i was gonna
dip her fat face

28:02.114 --> 28:04.682
In some cold fry oil
to scare all you bitches.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.850
Well, i propose
a change of plans.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.619
What do you
think, ms. Bean?

28:08.621 --> 28:10.320
How about i just
drown you in it?

28:10.322 --> 28:11.855
(gasps)

28:12.992 --> 28:15.359
(all screaming)

28:18.798 --> 28:21.198
Oh, my god,
who turned the fryer on?!

28:25.137 --> 28:27.204
(hissing)

28:27.206 --> 28:29.873
(all screaming)

28:48.327 --> 28:50.828
She's dead.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.831
Well, of course she's dead!
You just burned her face off!

28:53.833 --> 28:56.333
Shut up. You don't die from
getting your face burned off.

28:56.335 --> 28:57.668
Yes, you do!

28:57.670 --> 28:59.336
She probably had a heart attack.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.237
Oh, my god.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.745
Where are you going?

29:07.747 --> 29:08.912
To get the campus police.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.380
There's a dead woman
in your kitchen.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.015
Oh! Ms. Bean
was a servant;

29:12.017 --> 29:14.017
She knew the risks.

29:14.019 --> 29:15.853
I'm going to the authorities.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.087
Fine, go.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.722
I'll be sure
to tell the police all about

29:18.724 --> 29:20.023
How you shoved ms. Bean
in that fryolator.

29:20.025 --> 29:22.025
What? You did that.

29:22.027 --> 29:24.261
That's not how i saw it.
And my witnesses agree.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.063
Pledges, show of hands.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.765
Who will back up my
story if i promise

29:27.767 --> 29:30.067
That by the end of the year,
i'll get you all boyfriends--

29:30.069 --> 29:31.468
Cool boyfriends?

29:32.905 --> 29:34.872
And i'll take you
all on my dad's jet

29:34.874 --> 29:35.973
To cancun for
spring break.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.009
All of y'all ratchet.

29:40.713 --> 29:42.246
You're an awful person.

29:42.248 --> 29:44.414
Maybe. But i'm rich
and i'm pretty,

29:44.416 --> 29:46.483
So it doesn't really matter.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.802
(grunting)

30:06.806 --> 30:10.908
Chanel: Sisters and pledges
of kappa kappa tau,

30:10.910 --> 30:14.077
You now all share something
so very precious to me.

30:14.079 --> 30:15.078
A felony?

30:15.080 --> 30:16.747
A secret.

30:16.749 --> 30:18.115
And secrets are the glue

30:18.117 --> 30:20.250
That binds
sorority sisters together.

30:20.252 --> 30:23.420
We will remember this night
for the rest of our lives.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.088
And until the day we die,

30:25.090 --> 30:26.924
We will know that we few
are the only people

30:26.926 --> 30:28.258
Who know what happened
in that kitchen.

30:28.260 --> 30:31.261
Because if any of you
ever tell,

30:31.263 --> 30:34.131
I will make sure you end up
laying right next to ms. Bean

30:34.133 --> 30:36.533
In this freezer.

30:37.770 --> 30:38.769
Who wants cocktails?

30:38.771 --> 30:40.170
Women:
Yay!

31:01.961 --> 31:04.027
How did my life turn into this?

31:05.965 --> 31:08.966
I marched for
the equal rights amendment,

31:08.968 --> 31:12.803
I burned my bra
in the middle of this campus,

31:12.805 --> 31:15.806
And then left school
to intern for gloria steinem

31:15.808 --> 31:17.975
At<i> ms. Magazine.</i>

31:17.977 --> 31:19.810
This generation...
(scoffs)

31:19.812 --> 31:22.012
It couldn't give a rat's
ass about any of it.

31:22.014 --> 31:24.348
Nothing's changed.

31:24.350 --> 31:27.317
Have you seen the way girls
dress on this campus?

31:27.319 --> 31:29.820
These sorority bitches

31:29.822 --> 31:32.356
Strutting around in basically
just their underwear,

31:32.358 --> 31:36.326
Screaming bloody murder
about being objectified,

31:36.328 --> 31:40.063
As if they haven't objectified
themselves already.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.332
And all that marching.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.334
All the protests.

31:44.336 --> 31:46.403
What did i get out of it?

31:49.909 --> 31:53.844
I'm sitting in the same office
i used to throw bricks into.

31:53.846 --> 31:56.179
I'm making less than
the 26-year-old

31:56.181 --> 31:59.516
Assistant football coach
who bangs the same brand

31:59.518 --> 32:03.287
Of perky 19-year-olds my husband
left me for two years ago.

32:06.191 --> 32:08.859
You're awful in bed.
Are you aware?

32:08.861 --> 32:11.028
I mean, just... The worst.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.530
What? What...
Did i not take you there?

32:13.532 --> 32:16.033
Look what i've stooped to.

32:16.035 --> 32:19.369
Getting sex by blackmailing
students on academic probation.

32:19.371 --> 32:22.873
Look, i need to say something.

32:22.875 --> 32:24.574
(sighs) i'm in love with you.

32:24.576 --> 32:26.209
Of course you are.

32:26.211 --> 32:27.911
Because that's the only way
this situation

32:27.913 --> 32:30.047
Could get more depressing.
Please leave.

32:30.049 --> 32:32.883
I will, but i'm gonna
take a pair of your panties.

32:32.885 --> 32:34.885
I'm gonna barf on your face
unless you get out of here.

32:34.887 --> 32:37.454
And-and go take
a psychology course.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.891
Try to figure out who gave you
such disgusting mommy issues.

32:40.893 --> 32:43.527
It was, you know,
probably my mom.

32:44.563 --> 32:47.397
Okay. Um, i'm gonna call you.

32:47.399 --> 32:51.401
As i can't destroy
every phone on earth,

32:51.403 --> 32:53.470
That'll remain
a possibility.

32:56.241 --> 32:57.541
(sighs)

32:59.478 --> 33:01.545
What?

33:02.481 --> 33:04.548
Done worse.

33:08.587 --> 33:10.087
I have to tell
you something.

33:10.089 --> 33:11.588
You loaded a dead body
into a freezer.

33:11.590 --> 33:14.157
Based on the strain on your
faces as you carried her out,

33:14.159 --> 33:16.293
My money's on ms. Bean.
Um, wh-what?

33:16.295 --> 33:17.694
You loaded
a dead body...
Shh!

33:22.968 --> 33:24.334
Um...

33:25.270 --> 33:27.637
You-you were spying on us?

33:27.639 --> 33:28.972
I'm an investigative reporter.

33:28.974 --> 33:30.640
And that house
is the story of a lifetime.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.342
I agree. That's why
i asked to meet you.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.277
What are you proposing?

33:34.279 --> 33:35.612
I want to help you
with your exposé,

33:35.614 --> 33:37.147
Secretly feed you info.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.482
You need eyes on the inside.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.117
You do have really pretty eyes.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.619
Focus on the case.
Look, i think chanel

33:42.621 --> 33:44.621
Accidentally killed her,
but now i'm not so sure.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.623
Wait, so when you thought
she murdered her,

33:46.625 --> 33:49.326
You helped her hide the body?
Look, it's more
complicated than that.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.161
I joined that sorority
to feel close to my mom.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.530
You know? I've heard the way
my dad talks about her--

33:53.532 --> 33:55.499
Kind, a fighter, big heart.

33:55.501 --> 33:58.301
No way she belonged to kappa
the way it is now.

33:58.303 --> 34:00.170
Chanel and her type
have destroyed it,

34:00.172 --> 34:02.305
Mutated it into the
monster it is today.

34:02.307 --> 34:04.541
But it can be
the way it was.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.510
I can change it back,
but i need to get chanel

34:06.512 --> 34:08.979
And her minions out
of there to do it.

34:08.981 --> 34:11.314
I need to expose chanel
for who she really is.

34:11.316 --> 34:13.016
And i want to use
your story as

34:13.018 --> 34:15.218
My weapon of
reputation destruction.

34:16.155 --> 34:18.989
I just want to
honor my mom.

34:18.991 --> 34:20.357
Deal.

34:20.359 --> 34:22.392
Mm. One last thing.

34:22.394 --> 34:25.495
What do we do now?

34:25.497 --> 34:27.497
Examine the body.

34:27.499 --> 34:28.498
(chuckles softly)

34:28.500 --> 34:29.766
(clears throat)

34:37.709 --> 34:39.776
(hinges creak)

35:01.033 --> 35:03.100
We hid her in there.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.370
(door opening)
chad: You shoved ms. Bean's face

35:07.372 --> 35:09.239
In a vat of hot oil?
Chanel:
Yes.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.707
The fryer wasn't
supposed to be on.

35:10.709 --> 35:13.543
I don't know what to do
with the body.

35:13.545 --> 35:16.079
Oh, chanel. That is so hot!

35:16.081 --> 35:17.280
What?

35:17.282 --> 35:19.116
Chad:
Hold up.

35:19.118 --> 35:20.717
Are you saying dead bodies
don't turn you on?

35:20.719 --> 35:22.385
Yes, that's exactly
what i'm saying.

35:22.387 --> 35:24.221
You are so lame,
you know that?

35:24.223 --> 35:26.056
God, i love all
that death stuff.

35:26.058 --> 35:29.292
I got my first boner watching
<i>faces of death.</i>

35:29.294 --> 35:30.727
Show me the body.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.729
Seriously?
Why did you bring
me here, chanel?

35:32.731 --> 35:34.097
Show me the
dead body.

35:34.099 --> 35:35.298
Hmm.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.639
What the hell?
Is this some kind of joke?

35:42.641 --> 35:44.274
Oh, my god, she's alive.

35:44.276 --> 35:45.275
Ms. Bean's alive.

35:45.277 --> 35:46.810
Yeah, or somebody
stole the body.

35:48.113 --> 35:50.113
Now i'm cold,
i got blue balls.

35:50.115 --> 35:52.182
The worst date ever.

35:59.591 --> 36:03.126
Chanel: Kappa sisters,
someone is screwing with us.

36:03.128 --> 36:05.595
This blood oath will ensure
solidarity among us.

36:05.597 --> 36:07.664
We are all related now.

36:07.666 --> 36:11.434
Let's all touch bloody fingers
as i read this oath.

36:11.436 --> 36:14.804
"hail, odin, wise warrior,
one-eyed wanderer,

36:14.806 --> 36:16.339
Tell the scenes
your missing eyes see."

36:16.341 --> 36:17.340
Chanel #5:
Wait, odin who?

36:17.342 --> 36:18.608
Where did you find that?

36:18.610 --> 36:20.110
I don't know, the internet.

36:20.112 --> 36:22.279
I just googled "blood oath"
and this is what came up.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.446
(clears throat)

36:23.448 --> 36:25.448
"norse father,

36:25.450 --> 36:28.485
You who chooses the slain
on this winter solstice..."

36:28.487 --> 36:30.120
What? "solstice"?
Is that wiccan?

36:30.122 --> 36:31.121
What does this
oath even mean?

36:31.123 --> 36:32.289
I don't know, number three.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.323
I didn't spend a lot of time
on the internet

36:33.325 --> 36:34.624
Looking through
different blood oaths.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.193
I just need you all
to not say anything

36:36.195 --> 36:37.627
About what happened,
and i figured a blood oath

36:37.629 --> 36:38.828
Was cheaper than
buying you all presents.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.463
Look, we're all
just freaking out, okay?

36:40.465 --> 36:41.631
Let's just
rub our fingers together

36:41.633 --> 36:42.799
And promise to keep quiet.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.467
Fine.

36:44.469 --> 36:45.635
Wait, what about stds?

36:45.637 --> 36:47.637
What if one of
us has, like,

36:47.639 --> 36:50.373
Genital warts or...
Chlamydia or something?

36:50.375 --> 36:52.209
Idiot, you don't get stds
from blood oaths.

36:52.211 --> 36:53.810
You get stds
from dirty toilet seats

36:53.812 --> 36:55.812
And drinking the water
in mexico.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.848
(sighs) um, "std" stands for
"sexually transmitted disease,"

36:58.850 --> 37:01.484
Which means
that it's transmitted sexually.

37:01.486 --> 37:04.521
Does it look like the four of us
are about to have sex

37:04.523 --> 37:06.189
Right now,
number five, huh?!

37:06.191 --> 37:07.157
I have hpv.

37:07.159 --> 37:08.391
What?

37:09.161 --> 37:10.827
Yeah. I got it last summer.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.329
It's not a big deal.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.363
A lot of girls have it.
I just think

37:13.365 --> 37:14.497
I should sit out
the whole blood oath thing.

37:14.499 --> 37:16.499
How did you get hpv?

37:16.501 --> 37:17.667
When were you
in mexico?

37:17.669 --> 37:19.402
I can't do this.

37:20.672 --> 37:23.206
Oh, god, fine. You know what,
forget the blood oath.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.341
Every time i try
to plan something,

37:24.343 --> 37:25.342
You dumb bitches ruin it.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.843
I can't stay silent!

37:26.845 --> 37:28.878
Somebody murdered ms. Bean,
and someone's gonna find out,

37:28.880 --> 37:31.348
And i want to be
a network newscaster.

37:31.350 --> 37:33.450
I'm calling my mom,
and i'm going home.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.588
(door slams)

37:45.264 --> 37:46.596

Okay, okay,
let's just all calm down.

40:35.700 --> 40:36.866
Clearly ms. Bean did this.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.935
That seems like an
insane conclusion

40:38.937 --> 40:40.937
To just jump to.
She's back from the dead,

40:40.939 --> 40:42.906
And she's getting revenge
by killing us one at a time.

40:42.908 --> 40:45.041
(exhales)

40:45.043 --> 40:46.543
Wait a minute.

40:46.545 --> 40:48.711
This is great. This is amazing.

40:48.713 --> 40:50.447
How is this amazing?

40:50.449 --> 40:52.715
If ms. Bean is still alive,
that proves i didn't kill her.

40:52.717 --> 40:54.617
Now i won't be prosecuted
for murder

40:54.619 --> 40:56.886
And i can stay popular
and on my proper career track,

40:56.888 --> 40:59.389
And chad radwell
won't break up with me.

40:59.391 --> 41:00.457
Okay, well, then
there's no reason

41:00.459 --> 41:02.459
We shouldn't
call the police.

41:02.461 --> 41:04.627
Are you kidding me,
number three?

41:04.629 --> 41:05.795
What are we gonna tell them,

41:05.797 --> 41:07.397
That we burned
ms. Bean's face off,

41:07.399 --> 41:08.565
Thought she was dead,

41:08.567 --> 41:10.467
Hid the body, then it came back
to life and stabbed

41:10.469 --> 41:12.101
Chanel #2 while we were
all in the house?

41:12.103 --> 41:13.102
They're never
gonna believe that.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.904
That's an insane story.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.072
That is insane.

41:16.074 --> 41:17.574
Until we can prove
what happened,

41:17.576 --> 41:18.908
We need to keep the body here.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.443
We can't just leave her
here; she was our friend.

41:20.445 --> 41:22.412
Meh.

41:22.414 --> 41:23.513
(doorbell rings)

41:24.449 --> 41:27.083
Ladies, that's the door.

41:27.085 --> 41:29.085
Hell week begins now.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.920
Good evening, idiot hookers.

41:30.922 --> 41:35.658
I'm very happy to welcome you to
hell week here at kappa house.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.428
Could you speak
up, please?

41:38.430 --> 41:39.462
I'm having trouble

41:39.464 --> 41:40.563
Hearing you.

41:40.564 --> 41:41.663
I said, "welcome to hell week!"

41:42.767 --> 41:44.000
When you stupid dugongs

41:44.002 --> 41:45.435
First waltzed
through that door,

41:45.437 --> 41:46.970
I could tell you thought
you were gonna have it easy.

41:46.972 --> 41:49.606
Well, let me relieve you
of that misconception,

41:49.608 --> 41:50.974
Because you're
about to get hazed

41:50.976 --> 41:52.842
Harder than
a suburban banquet hall

41:52.844 --> 41:54.844
During bat
mitzvah season.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.847
I am not gonna let you haze
any of these girls.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.449
And i will litigate.

41:59.451 --> 42:01.618
Grace: There's going to be
a new kappa house

42:01.620 --> 42:03.953
On this campus,
and it starts with us.
Hmm.

42:03.955 --> 42:06.623
It's going to be a sorority
about empowerment,

42:06.625 --> 42:07.790
Sisterhood and respect.

42:07.792 --> 42:09.158
That sounds terrible.

42:09.160 --> 42:10.627
Chanel:
Okay, pissy spacek,

42:10.629 --> 42:13.129
You and i have a few differences
we need to iron out.

42:13.131 --> 42:15.031
What do you say
to a little coffee klatch?

42:15.033 --> 42:16.132
We can talk it over.

42:16.134 --> 42:17.867
Number five, you're in charge.

42:19.804 --> 42:21.137
You got it, girl.

42:21.139 --> 42:22.539
(whispers):
Thank you.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.810
I got you
a pumpkin spice latte.

42:27.812 --> 42:30.480
They're so my jam,
even though they make me obese.

42:30.482 --> 42:32.048
We're not here
to make nice.

42:32.050 --> 42:34.717
You want to talk,
let's talk.

42:34.719 --> 42:37.053
Fine. I can't stand you.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.721
But you also remind me
of a young me.

42:38.723 --> 42:39.989
So here's my compromise.

42:39.991 --> 42:42.058
I want you to be
one of my minions.

42:43.194 --> 42:45.995
Grace, i want you
to be chanel #6.

42:45.997 --> 42:48.831
Wow. Uh, quite an honor.

42:48.833 --> 42:49.866
It is.

42:49.868 --> 42:51.200
It's the gateway
to the top of the heap.

42:51.202 --> 42:53.503
No.

42:53.505 --> 42:57.006
Look at where being kappa
queen has gotten you.

42:57.008 --> 42:59.676
You put on a good front,
but you're miserable.

42:59.678 --> 43:02.679
Don't you think any of that has
anything to do with the fact

43:02.681 --> 43:04.681
That you've created an
atmosphere based solely

43:04.683 --> 43:06.215
On negativity and raw ambition?

43:06.217 --> 43:07.717
You say that
like those are bad things.

43:07.719 --> 43:08.851
(sighs)

43:08.853 --> 43:10.286
Uh, wait.

43:12.223 --> 43:14.023
Okay, you're the only person
at this school

43:14.025 --> 43:15.758
Who is almost as smart as me.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.027
Can we talk for real
for a second, please?

43:18.029 --> 43:19.529
I mean, you're so confident

43:19.531 --> 43:20.563
Without being mean.

43:20.565 --> 43:21.864
What antidepressants are you on?

43:21.866 --> 43:23.633
(sighs)

43:24.569 --> 43:26.569
Chanel,

43:26.571 --> 43:29.939
Why are you so awful
to everyone?

43:29.941 --> 43:32.542
My boyfriend
compulsively cheats on me.

43:32.544 --> 43:33.876
All of my friends work for me.

43:33.878 --> 43:35.712
My parents didn't even call me
on my birthday

43:35.714 --> 43:36.713
Because they were too busy

43:36.715 --> 43:39.949
Hosting a fundraiser
for jeb bush.

43:39.951 --> 43:43.720
Don't you see that all
that's happened isn't a crisis?

43:43.722 --> 43:45.922
It's an opportunity,

43:45.924 --> 43:49.125
For you and for kappa
to really change.

43:49.127 --> 43:51.594
Think about how
great it would be

43:51.596 --> 43:53.930
To have a real sisterhood,

43:53.932 --> 43:57.200
One that will always
remember your birthday.

44:00.805 --> 44:03.573
Yeah, no, i tried.
See, i really tried.

44:03.575 --> 44:05.608
But all of this flowery,
peace-on-earth crap,

44:05.610 --> 44:07.076
It makes me want to puke.

44:07.078 --> 44:09.178
You're pathetic.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.581
(scoffs)

44:11.583 --> 44:13.082
Yeah, walk away now!

44:13.084 --> 44:15.585
You haven't even seen
half of what i'm capable of!

44:15.587 --> 44:17.954
Once you're on my fatwa list,
i show no mercy!

44:17.956 --> 44:19.589
(door closes)

44:19.591 --> 44:21.858
Totally spit in your coffee,
bitch.

44:23.595 --> 44:24.927
(sighs)

44:24.929 --> 44:26.929
The sexy gopher
whore head challenge

44:26.931 --> 44:29.265
Is one of kappa house's
oldest hazing traditions.

44:29.267 --> 44:30.767
You gals are gonna
stay here overnight,

44:30.769 --> 44:32.101
Getting to know each other

44:32.103 --> 44:34.604
And trying to keep the ants
from crawling up your noses,

44:34.606 --> 44:35.772
While the chanels and i

44:35.774 --> 44:37.774
Go get banana daiquiris
at the white stallion.

44:37.776 --> 44:39.342
Good night, ladies.

44:46.951 --> 44:49.952
(gate creaks closed)

44:49.954 --> 44:53.122
Guys, i can't move at all.

44:53.124 --> 44:54.190
I think that's the point!

44:54.192 --> 44:55.625
Jennifer: I don't mean
to be a contrarian,

44:55.627 --> 44:58.127
But i'm enjoying this.
Tiffany: You guys,

44:58.129 --> 45:00.863
What do you think taylor swift
is doing right now?

45:00.865 --> 45:02.632
(sighs)

45:02.634 --> 45:04.634
(crickets chirping)

45:04.636 --> 45:06.035
(owl hooting in distance)

45:09.307 --> 45:11.207
(soft rattling)

45:12.644 --> 45:15.645
What time is it? It's got to be,
like, 4:00 in the morning.

45:15.647 --> 45:17.714
(gate rattles)
did y'all hear that?

45:20.852 --> 45:22.018
Did y'all hear that?!

45:22.020 --> 45:23.853
What are you guys
talking about?

45:23.855 --> 45:24.987
(motor starts)

45:24.989 --> 45:27.156
(whirring)

45:27.158 --> 45:30.026
Is that killer noises
or am i hallucinating?

45:30.028 --> 45:31.060
Chanel, is that you?

45:31.062 --> 45:32.995
Tiffany: I'm gonna ask
one more time,

45:32.997 --> 45:34.330
Will you speak up?

45:34.332 --> 45:36.332
(lawnmower whirring)

45:36.334 --> 45:38.334
Is that a lawnmower?

45:38.336 --> 45:39.869
What's happening?!

45:39.871 --> 45:40.670
(screams)

45:40.672 --> 45:41.337
Help me!

45:41.339 --> 45:42.672
Help me!
Help me!

45:42.674 --> 45:43.673
Help me!

45:43.675 --> 45:45.341
Are you screaming?
Help me!

45:45.343 --> 45:46.876
Or are you singing?
Help me!

45:46.878 --> 45:49.145
Help! This a nice neighborhood!

45:50.849 --> 45:52.248

47:01.452 --> 47:03.085
What can you tell us
about the murder?

47:03.087 --> 47:05.755
We can confirm
that an incident occurred

47:05.757 --> 47:07.924
That may have injured

47:07.926 --> 47:10.827
We need some information.
(reporters clamoring)

47:10.829 --> 47:13.129
But i can tell you
that the campus is open

47:13.131 --> 47:15.932
And classes are resuming
and frogurt is back,

47:15.934 --> 47:18.768
After popular demand,
in the dining hall.

47:18.770 --> 47:22.271

47:57.842 --> 47:59.842
<i>Girls, this is</i>

47:59.844 --> 48:01.844
He's here investigating
the beheading

48:01.846 --> 48:04.347
That happened in your garden
last night.

48:04.349 --> 48:07.316
Where is ms. Bean and chanel #2?

48:07.318 --> 48:09.318
It is pretty suspicious
they're not here.

48:09.320 --> 48:12.321
Well, as far as i'm concerned,
all of you are suspects.

48:12.323 --> 48:14.991
It was only a matter of time
before things got out of hand

48:14.993 --> 48:16.826
At the sorority
and someone got killed.

48:16.828 --> 48:18.327
We don't want any of
you leaving campus

48:18.329 --> 48:20.162
Until we get to
talk to all of you,

48:20.164 --> 48:21.397
Get a better sense
of what happened.

48:21.399 --> 48:23.399
Y-you can't keep us
prisoner here.

48:23.401 --> 48:25.067
No, he can't.

48:25.069 --> 48:27.870
But none of you
are excused to leave.

48:27.872 --> 48:30.039
So, if you do,
you will be graded

48:30.041 --> 48:33.175
On every missed test
and class assignment.

48:33.177 --> 48:36.012
And this investigation
could take weeks,

48:36.014 --> 48:38.180
Which means it's most likely

48:38.182 --> 48:39.949
That you will
fail out of college.

48:41.853 --> 48:43.185
Wh... Gigi, you can't
let her do this.

48:43.187 --> 48:44.520
If someone is targeting you,

48:44.522 --> 48:46.188
They're gonna find you
wherever you are.

48:46.190 --> 48:47.857
You know?
And at least if you're here,

48:47.859 --> 48:49.191
You can keep an eye
out on each other.

48:49.193 --> 48:50.893
We can make it fun, huh?

48:50.895 --> 48:52.561
Like a<i> friends</i> episode.

48:52.563 --> 48:55.231
But someone's, you know...

48:55.233 --> 48:56.866
Trying to murder
all the friends.

48:56.868 --> 48:57.566
Munsch:
Good.

48:57.568 --> 49:00.102
Then it's decided.

49:00.104 --> 49:02.038
Detective, there's a sushi bar

49:02.040 --> 49:04.040
That i love...

49:04.042 --> 49:06.208
You guys, gigi is right.

49:06.210 --> 49:08.077
We have to move into the house.
It's the only way

49:08.079 --> 49:09.211
We can look after one another.

49:09.213 --> 49:10.947
That's insane, okay?

49:10.949 --> 49:12.882
Pledges cannot
move into the house.

49:12.884 --> 49:15.051
The risks are real,
but we need to close ranks.

49:15.053 --> 49:16.886
If any of you die
while protecting a sister,

49:16.888 --> 49:18.888
You're allowed to skip
the rest of hell week.

49:18.890 --> 49:20.222
And i'm gonna hire security.

49:20.224 --> 49:22.558
I don't feel comfortable
with a man protecting me.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.293
It's representative
of the patriarchal,

49:24.295 --> 49:26.228
Post-colonial culture
that encourages violence

49:26.230 --> 49:28.397
Against women.

49:28.399 --> 49:29.565
Gigi:
Always...

49:29.567 --> 49:31.300
Saying what everyone
is thinking.

49:32.270 --> 49:33.903
Ladies...

49:33.905 --> 49:35.137
I got this, okay?

49:36.240 --> 49:38.074
I got it.

49:38.076 --> 49:39.575
We've got to get rid of the body

49:39.577 --> 49:41.110
Before the new security guard
finds it.

49:41.112 --> 49:42.611
Ideas. Go.

49:42.613 --> 49:44.480
We buy a pig
and feed it the body.

49:44.482 --> 49:46.415
Pigs will eat anything.

49:46.417 --> 49:48.584
Oh, yeah, number five,
let's just mosey on down

49:48.586 --> 49:51.087
To the hog district
and bring home a 400-pound sow.

49:51.089 --> 49:52.488
That's not conspicuous at all.

49:52.490 --> 49:54.090
My uncle owns a dairy farm
in wisconsin,

49:54.092 --> 49:55.424
And they have
these poop lagoons.

49:55.426 --> 49:56.459
They're, like,
ten feet deep,

49:56.461 --> 49:57.927
And in winter, they freeze over.

49:57.929 --> 49:59.929
And my uncle told me
and my sister, like,

49:59.931 --> 50:01.497
"don't go skating
on those poop lagoons,

50:01.499 --> 50:04.133
"because if you fall in,
you'll drown in the poop

50:04.135 --> 50:07.636
And come springtime, there'll be
nothing left of your body."

50:07.638 --> 50:09.638
Do you and your sister
have some form

50:09.640 --> 50:11.440
Of intellectual disability?

50:11.442 --> 50:14.110
Because if i encountered
a lake of frozen poo,

50:14.112 --> 50:16.112
Literally the last question
i would ask is:

50:16.114 --> 50:17.279
Can we ice-skate on this?

50:17.281 --> 50:19.048
Hester:
I know what you should do.

50:20.985 --> 50:22.485
This isn't what
it looks like.

50:22.487 --> 50:25.287
She's asleep.
Chanel #2 is asleep.

50:25.289 --> 50:27.990
Don't worry,
we're sisters.

50:27.992 --> 50:29.992
(whispers):
I won't tell anyone.

50:29.994 --> 50:32.294
When i was six years old,
my father died,

50:32.296 --> 50:34.463
And my mother made me
kiss the body at his funeral.

50:34.465 --> 50:35.531
Ever since then,

50:35.533 --> 50:38.134
I've been obsessed with death.

50:38.136 --> 50:39.502
Here's what you should do.

50:39.504 --> 50:40.970
Pulverize her teeth,

50:40.972 --> 50:43.205
Burn off her fingerprints
and disfigure her face.

50:43.207 --> 50:44.306
Once her body is
unrecognizable,

50:44.308 --> 50:46.542
We can create an incision
on her inner thigh

50:46.544 --> 50:48.377
And drain out
all of her bodily fluids.

50:48.379 --> 50:50.546
That'll give us more time
to deconstruct the body.

50:50.548 --> 50:52.048
Ew! What?!

50:52.050 --> 50:54.683
Because truly grinding down
a body takes a lot of work.

50:54.685 --> 50:56.052
You need a really good

50:56.054 --> 50:57.319
Food processor,

50:57.321 --> 50:58.687
And you run the risk
of fouling the plumbing,

50:58.689 --> 51:00.656
Which is why you should
only do it if you know

51:00.658 --> 51:03.192
How to clear out meat and bones
from a drain pipe.

51:03.194 --> 51:06.062
Each of these plans has
its drawbacks, but don't worry.

51:06.064 --> 51:08.230
I'm willing to help
in any way possible.

51:08.232 --> 51:11.200
You're obviously a psychopath
and those ideas are insane!

51:11.202 --> 51:13.002
So, no, we won't be
putting her in

51:13.004 --> 51:15.504
A food processor or boning her
like an enormous chicken.

51:15.506 --> 51:17.039
We're gonna put her
in the meat locker

51:17.041 --> 51:18.207
For now and revisit the question

51:18.209 --> 51:19.575
When i'm not
totally grossed out by you

51:19.577 --> 51:21.710
And feeling like
i'm going to barf.
Okay.

51:21.712 --> 51:24.246
Grab the duvet and wrap her up.

51:26.184 --> 51:28.017
(all grunt)

51:28.019 --> 51:29.418
Hester:
We should touch her.

51:29.420 --> 51:32.188
If we touch her,
she won't haunt our dreams.

51:32.190 --> 51:33.689
Wait, why would she
haunt our dreams?

51:33.691 --> 51:35.191
And if her eyes are open,

51:35.193 --> 51:36.525
She'll take one
of us with her.

51:36.527 --> 51:39.528
Take with her? What the hell
are you talking about?!

51:39.530 --> 51:41.030
Why are you trying
to terrify us?

51:41.032 --> 51:42.031
Can i call you mom?

51:42.033 --> 51:43.532
What?
Please?

51:43.534 --> 51:45.201
I feel so loved and protected
by all of you.

51:45.203 --> 51:48.037
Wait, you want to call
all of us mom? That's insane.

51:48.039 --> 51:49.205
And super confusing.

51:49.207 --> 51:50.573
Actually, it's a new
pop culture trend

51:50.575 --> 51:52.374
Where young women desperately
in need of role models

51:52.376 --> 51:54.110
Call other girls
they look up to mom.

51:54.112 --> 51:55.611
Lorde's fans
call her mom.

51:55.613 --> 51:57.246
I thought
you'd be cool with it.

51:57.248 --> 51:58.547
I mean, i did just give you

51:58.549 --> 52:00.216
Several ways
to dispose of a body.

52:00.218 --> 52:02.718
Fine, okay, you can
call all of us mom.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.620
Let's just lock the body
in here and forget

52:04.622 --> 52:06.755
Any of this ever happened.
Wait, mom.

52:06.757 --> 52:08.557
We shouldn't lock her in here.
If we do,

52:08.559 --> 52:11.227
Her soul will be able to escape,
and then it'll follow us around.

52:11.229 --> 52:13.562
Okay, fine.
Just stop talking.

52:13.564 --> 52:15.798
You are
so friggin' creepy!

52:22.240 --> 52:24.473
Ladies, this is
officer hempville.

52:24.475 --> 52:26.242
Officer, we are
so happy...

52:26.244 --> 52:27.576
Excuse me.

52:27.578 --> 52:28.577
Where did you find her?

52:28.579 --> 52:30.079
Well, i knew we needed

52:30.081 --> 52:32.081
A top-notch
security company,

52:32.083 --> 52:34.316
So i let my fingers
do the walkin'.

52:35.253 --> 52:36.752
I checked the
yellow pages.

52:36.754 --> 52:38.587
What's that?

52:38.589 --> 52:40.089
Officer, we're terrified.

52:40.091 --> 52:42.758
Okay? Someone just
mowed off a deaf girl's head

52:42.760 --> 52:44.093
In our backyard.

52:44.095 --> 52:46.295
Well, ladies, you have
nothing to be afraid of

52:46.297 --> 52:47.630
So long as i'm around.

52:47.632 --> 52:50.266
Though-though technically,
i'm not a police officer.

52:50.268 --> 52:53.435
I mean, as you can see, i'm not
licensed to carry a sidearm.

52:53.437 --> 52:56.438
I am employed by
secure enforcement solutions,

52:56.440 --> 52:58.174
Which is a private contractor

52:58.176 --> 53:01.110
Hired to work in tandem
with campus security.

53:01.112 --> 53:02.444
Wait, so you don't have a gun?

53:02.446 --> 53:03.445
No, i do not.

53:03.447 --> 53:05.114
But i do have...

53:05.116 --> 53:06.782
A nightstick, okay?

53:06.784 --> 53:08.284
I have pepper spray.

53:08.286 --> 53:10.452
And i have a walkie talkie
that i can use

53:10.454 --> 53:13.122
To call the police,
who do have guns.

53:13.124 --> 53:14.456
What good are you?

53:14.458 --> 53:16.625
We can call the police
ourselves.

53:16.627 --> 53:18.127
Well, with denise hempville
on the scene,

53:18.129 --> 53:19.295
You're not gonna have to.

53:19.297 --> 53:22.798
Now, i-if there is a killer
on this campus,

53:22.800 --> 53:25.134
Denise hempville's
gonna make damn sure

53:25.136 --> 53:28.170
That everybody in kappa house
is safe and sound

53:28.172 --> 53:30.639
Until that killer
is brought to justice.

53:30.641 --> 53:31.807
How?

53:31.809 --> 53:33.642
I'm glad you asked.

53:33.644 --> 53:37.213
With the secure enforcement
solution three-step program.

53:37.215 --> 53:38.647
Right? Step one.

53:38.649 --> 53:40.349
If you are in danger,

53:40.351 --> 53:43.219
Scream denise hempville's name
real loud.

53:43.221 --> 53:44.653
I will be on the premises

53:44.655 --> 53:47.323
At all times,
and i will come a-runnin'.

53:47.325 --> 53:48.490
Now, let's just say

53:48.492 --> 53:49.558
You screamed
denise hempville's name

53:49.560 --> 53:51.160
And i do not come a-runnin'.

53:51.162 --> 53:52.561
That means i'm not
on the premises.

53:52.563 --> 53:56.332
Okay? In that case,
proceed to step two.

53:56.334 --> 54:00.669
Call 1-866-klj-0199.

54:00.671 --> 54:03.239
Okay? I will be
notified immediately

54:03.241 --> 54:04.840
And come a-runnin'.

54:04.842 --> 54:06.408
Wait, sorry, what...
Yeah. Hold on.

54:06.410 --> 54:09.678
Now, if-if you can't
get through to the 866 number

54:09.680 --> 54:11.847
Because of long wait times
and such,

54:11.849 --> 54:14.850
Then what you're gonna want
to do is proceed to step three.

54:14.852 --> 54:17.853
Get the hell out of there.
Run away, real fast.

54:17.855 --> 54:19.255
Are you serious?

54:19.257 --> 54:21.590
Yeah, run away,
get out of there, scram! Okay?

54:21.592 --> 54:23.359
And when you
get to a place

54:23.361 --> 54:25.261
That is deemed by you
to be safe,

54:25.263 --> 54:29.598
Call 1-866-klj-0199.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.699
All right?

54:30.701 --> 54:33.202
Now, i would
give you my number,

54:33.204 --> 54:35.204
But my cell phone
is off right now.

54:35.206 --> 54:37.539
But if you call the 866 number--

54:37.541 --> 54:39.208
Boom, on the walkie.

54:39.210 --> 54:40.542
They can always get me.

54:40.544 --> 54:42.344

the steps again?

There's not enough soap
in your bucket.

54:58.796 --> 55:00.262
Can't get the floor clean
without suds.

55:00.264 --> 55:01.730
If you want the place clean,
maybe you shouldn't

55:01.732 --> 55:02.731
Have burned the
maid's face off.

55:02.733 --> 55:04.433
You have no proof of that.

55:04.435 --> 55:07.269
I will go get more soap.

1:02:06.990 --> 1:02:08.657
(door opens)
oh.

1:02:08.659 --> 1:02:09.991
Oh. (gasps)

1:02:09.993 --> 1:02:12.661
Oh, my god.
You scared me.

1:02:12.663 --> 1:02:14.730
You're a snoopy little bugger.

1:02:14.732 --> 1:02:17.699
And i don't like
snoopy little buggers.

1:02:17.701 --> 1:02:19.701
What is all this stuff?

1:02:19.703 --> 1:02:23.705
This is where kappa keeps
its darkest secrets.

1:02:23.707 --> 1:02:27.275
And now that you've seen them,
i have to kill you.

1:02:28.212 --> 1:02:30.345
Would you please?
I'm kidding.

1:02:30.347 --> 1:02:32.748
Whose bloody
clothes are those?

1:02:32.750 --> 1:02:35.183
(sighs)

1:02:35.185 --> 1:02:38.353
Allegedly, like,
20 or so years ago,

1:02:38.355 --> 1:02:40.088
A girl died in this tub.

1:02:41.191 --> 1:02:43.024
It wasn't down here then.

1:02:43.026 --> 1:02:45.694
It was up
in one of the bathrooms.

1:02:45.696 --> 1:02:47.696
She had a baby during a party,

1:02:47.698 --> 1:02:49.397
And the sisters
let her bleed out

1:02:49.399 --> 1:02:51.199
Because they were having
so much fun.

1:02:51.201 --> 1:02:52.934
That is awful.

1:02:52.936 --> 1:02:54.269
I don't know.

1:02:54.271 --> 1:02:56.037
Supposedly,
it was a super fun party.

1:02:56.039 --> 1:02:57.773
Anyway,

1:02:57.775 --> 1:03:00.275
Her dying isn't even
the best part.

1:03:00.277 --> 1:03:03.278
The best part is how
they supposedly covered it up.

1:03:09.787 --> 1:03:11.753
Woman: What's wrong with her?
She looks awful.

1:03:11.755 --> 1:03:13.054
She's dead.

1:03:13.056 --> 1:03:16.057
Okay? What the hell
are we gonna do?

1:03:16.059 --> 1:03:17.225
Maybe we can drop
the baby off

1:03:17.227 --> 1:03:18.727
In front of the emergency room,
and then run away,

1:03:18.729 --> 1:03:20.061
And then we can just act like

1:03:20.063 --> 1:03:21.897
What's-her-name died
of natural causes.

1:03:21.899 --> 1:03:24.833
You idiot, they can do tests
for childbirth and stuff.

1:03:26.804 --> 1:03:28.403
We're all gonna pay for this.

1:03:28.405 --> 1:03:30.305
Well, somebody certainly is.

1:03:30.307 --> 1:03:32.741
How the hell did you
find out about this?

1:03:32.743 --> 1:03:34.743
(sighs)

1:03:34.745 --> 1:03:38.313
Nothing happens in this house
without me knowing about it.

1:03:49.126 --> 1:03:51.126
Dean munsch covered all this up?

1:03:51.128 --> 1:03:53.261
I think it's all crap.

1:03:53.263 --> 1:03:55.263
Just a myth.

1:03:55.265 --> 1:03:58.166
You don't believe that.

1:03:58.168 --> 1:04:00.001
You think it's real.

1:04:01.939 --> 1:04:04.005
How do you know
that this isn't somehow related

1:04:04.007 --> 1:04:05.440
To what's happening now?

1:04:05.442 --> 1:04:07.275
Let's face it.

1:04:07.277 --> 1:04:09.845
You don't have to go back
20 years to find someone

1:04:09.847 --> 1:04:12.347
The sisters here pissed off
enough to go homicidal on us.

1:04:14.952 --> 1:04:16.985
Wait. Um, you don't just

1:04:16.987 --> 1:04:19.354
Expect me to let
this go, do you?

1:04:21.291 --> 1:04:22.858
Actually, i do.

1:04:27.798 --> 1:04:30.866
(door opens)

1:04:30.868 --> 1:04:34.202
What happened to the baby?

1:04:42.312 --> 1:04:44.012
Chad:
<i>Mm-hmm. You like that?</i>

1:04:44.014 --> 1:04:45.881
Chanel:
<i>Yeah, it feels so good.</i>

1:04:45.883 --> 1:04:47.816
Chad:<i> That's it.</i>
<i>Sometimes i picture myself</i>

1:04:47.818 --> 1:04:49.818
<i>Like derek jeter, you know?</i>

1:04:49.820 --> 1:04:52.020
Yeah, jetes. I'm
gonna switch it up.
Mmm.

1:04:52.022 --> 1:04:54.022
I'm gonna
choke you out.
Chad!

1:04:54.024 --> 1:04:55.991
There's a serial killer
on the loose.

1:04:55.993 --> 1:04:58.059
Please don't say
you want to choke me.

1:04:58.061 --> 1:04:59.995
Okay.

1:04:59.997 --> 1:05:01.496
Geez. Sorry.

1:05:01.498 --> 1:05:02.831
Uptight.

1:05:02.833 --> 1:05:04.165
(both moaning)

1:05:04.167 --> 1:05:05.500
Chad:
You like that?

1:05:05.502 --> 1:05:07.836
I'd love having sex
with your corpse.
What?!

1:05:07.838 --> 1:05:09.838
What did you just say?

1:05:09.840 --> 1:05:11.339
You just talked about
a serial killer.

1:05:11.341 --> 1:05:13.508
You made me picture it.
Okay, you know what?

1:05:13.510 --> 1:05:15.510
I'm sorry. This isn't
working for me.

1:05:15.512 --> 1:05:17.412
You know what i could
really use right now?

1:05:17.414 --> 1:05:18.914
A boyfriend!

1:05:18.916 --> 1:05:20.215
Well, i sort of am
your boyfriend,

1:05:20.217 --> 1:05:22.851
And i'm protecting you
by having sex with you.

1:05:22.853 --> 1:05:25.186
No! I don't need
a man to protect me.

1:05:25.188 --> 1:05:27.856
How could i have
wasted this much time?

1:05:27.858 --> 1:05:30.025
Is my self-esteem
really that low?

1:05:30.027 --> 1:05:33.361
I'm sorry. I think
we need to take a break.

1:05:33.363 --> 1:05:35.530
What does that mean?
It means exactly what
you think it means.

1:05:35.532 --> 1:05:37.098
I need you to leave right now!

1:05:43.540 --> 1:05:46.441
I'm sorry. Are you breaking up
with me, chad radwell?

1:05:48.078 --> 1:05:50.378
You're breaking up
with chad radwell?

1:05:50.380 --> 1:05:52.113
(sighs)

1:05:52.115 --> 1:05:55.216
You're gonna be sorry.

1:05:55.218 --> 1:05:57.452
Nobody breaks up
with chad radwell.

1:06:04.428 --> 1:06:06.461
(groans)

1:06:10.067 --> 1:06:12.133
(sighs)

1:06:14.104 --> 1:06:16.237
What's going on?

1:06:16.239 --> 1:06:18.940
You are not gonna
believe this.

1:06:18.942 --> 1:06:21.076
Chanel broke up with me.

1:06:21.078 --> 1:06:23.111
(scoffs)
what a bitch.

1:06:23.113 --> 1:06:25.246
She doesn't realize
how good she had it.
So stupid.

1:06:25.248 --> 1:06:26.581
(sniffles)

1:06:26.583 --> 1:06:28.583
Look, don't worry,
bro. Don't worry.

1:06:28.585 --> 1:06:31.252
She's gonna come crawling
back to you in no time.

1:06:31.254 --> 1:06:33.488
Good night, boone.

1:06:34.424 --> 1:06:36.057
(groans)

1:06:37.995 --> 1:06:39.594
Hey, chad?

1:06:39.596 --> 1:06:41.596
Yeah?

1:06:41.598 --> 1:06:43.431
(sighs)

1:06:43.433 --> 1:06:45.934
I'm really scared.

1:06:45.936 --> 1:06:48.636
You know, with the serial killer
on the loose.

1:06:48.638 --> 1:06:50.138
Just having trouble sleeping.

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:52.507
You know what would really
help me feel-feel better?

1:06:52.509 --> 1:06:56.511
If-if... I could just, like,
crawl in bed with you?

1:06:58.515 --> 1:07:00.949
Hey, boone.
(sighs)

1:07:00.951 --> 1:07:03.618
Do you remember that time there
was that big thunderstorm, and

1:07:03.620 --> 1:07:06.287
You were really scared, and you
asked to crawl into bed with me,

1:07:06.289 --> 1:07:08.623
And i was a little weirded out,
but you're my little bro,

1:07:08.625 --> 1:07:11.659
So i said okay, and then...
You tried to touch my wiener?

1:07:11.661 --> 1:07:13.995
Yeah.

1:07:13.997 --> 1:07:16.131
One of the least fun things
in life is when your gay bro--

1:07:16.133 --> 1:07:17.966
He's gay, and he
knows you're not gay,

1:07:17.968 --> 1:07:20.035
And he tries to touch
your wiener anyway.

1:07:20.037 --> 1:07:21.302
Yeah, chad, i know.

1:07:21.304 --> 1:07:22.637
All right, i said i was sorry.

1:07:22.639 --> 1:07:24.139
A one-time thing.

1:07:24.141 --> 1:07:25.473
I'm just...

1:07:25.475 --> 1:07:27.142
Just really scared.

1:07:27.144 --> 1:07:29.544
You know, it would really
help me feel better

1:07:29.546 --> 1:07:33.381
If i could just crawl into bed
with you for a few minutes.

1:07:36.653 --> 1:07:38.653
Are you gonna touch my wiener,
or you gonna leave

1:07:38.655 --> 1:07:40.722
My wiener alone?
I'll leave your wiener alone.

1:07:44.161 --> 1:07:46.227
Bffs. Get over here.

1:07:54.671 --> 1:07:57.405
Where are your hands?

1:07:57.407 --> 1:07:59.574
On the frog.

1:07:59.576 --> 1:08:01.009
(toy frog croaks)

1:08:01.011 --> 1:08:03.011
Yeah.
Good night, boone.

1:08:03.013 --> 1:08:04.479
Night, chad.

1:08:06.516 --> 1:08:08.083
Get away.
Come on.

1:08:08.085 --> 1:08:11.586
Chad?

1:08:11.588 --> 1:08:13.688
Chaddy?

1:08:13.690 --> 1:08:16.091
You must be so upset. I...

1:08:16.093 --> 1:08:18.726
Chaddy, i'm here.

1:08:18.728 --> 1:08:20.361
I think we should talk.

1:08:20.363 --> 1:08:23.765
Perhaps i was
a bit too rash or...

1:08:25.569 --> 1:08:28.570
Oh! Oh.

1:08:28.572 --> 1:08:29.737
This is not what
it looks like.

1:08:29.739 --> 1:08:31.706
He has a huge boner!

1:08:31.708 --> 1:08:33.741
(sighs)
boone.

1:08:33.743 --> 1:08:37.245
Chanel. Okay.

1:08:37.247 --> 1:08:39.047
I can't believe this.

1:08:39.049 --> 1:08:41.282
You're gay?
Uh, no.

1:08:41.284 --> 1:08:43.118
Boone was scared,
so i let him crawl

1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:45.120
Into bad with me,
'cause he's my bro.

1:08:45.122 --> 1:08:47.388
He's your gay bro
who has a big boner for you.

1:08:47.390 --> 1:08:49.390
Why don't you go in there
and ogle his big old broner?

1:08:49.392 --> 1:08:50.758
Okay, uh, first of all,

1:08:50.760 --> 1:08:53.128
I'm not gonna go ogle
his big old broner,

1:08:53.130 --> 1:08:54.562
Because i'm not gay,

1:08:54.564 --> 1:08:56.464
Chanel, and you better not
tell anybody boone's gay--

1:08:56.466 --> 1:08:59.234
Even though he is-- because golf
frats aren't big on gay dudes,

1:08:59.236 --> 1:09:00.568
And because we like
hitting golf balls

1:09:00.570 --> 1:09:02.070
With the gay-straight
alliance kids,

1:09:02.072 --> 1:09:03.271
And i would like to
keep doing that.

1:09:03.273 --> 1:09:06.241
And second,
look, i'm sorry

1:09:06.243 --> 1:09:07.408
Everybody wants
to have sex with me.

1:09:07.410 --> 1:09:09.077
Okay? I can't help that.

1:09:09.079 --> 1:09:10.078
News flash, chanel:

1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:11.079
I'm hot.

1:09:11.081 --> 1:09:12.280
Everybody wants
to get with this.

1:09:12.282 --> 1:09:15.116
Women, men,
animals in the zoo,

1:09:15.118 --> 1:09:16.417
Plants, probably.

1:09:16.419 --> 1:09:17.652
And if you can't
handle that,

1:09:17.654 --> 1:09:18.753
Then you're just
gonna have to go.

1:09:18.755 --> 1:09:20.121
You're gonna have to go
right now,

1:09:20.123 --> 1:09:21.289
'cause i am breaking up
with you.

1:09:21.291 --> 1:09:22.757
Excuse me.

1:09:22.759 --> 1:09:24.492
<i>I</i> broke up with<i> you!</i>

1:09:24.494 --> 1:09:27.128
Oh, really?
What are you doing here, chanel?

1:09:27.130 --> 1:09:28.329
(sighs)

1:09:28.331 --> 1:09:29.664
I regretted what i said,

1:09:29.666 --> 1:09:32.767
And i just wanted to come here
and tell you that i am

1:09:32.769 --> 1:09:33.801
So sorry.

1:09:33.803 --> 1:09:35.803
Well, i accept your apology.

1:09:35.805 --> 1:09:37.605
And now i'm breaking up
with you.

1:09:37.607 --> 1:09:39.607
What?!
Do you know why i'm breaking up
with you?

1:09:39.609 --> 1:09:42.277
Because you are a spoiled,
homophobic little girl

1:09:42.279 --> 1:09:44.145
Who can't handle the fact
that everybody on campus

1:09:44.147 --> 1:09:45.280
Just wants to get with me.

1:09:45.282 --> 1:09:46.781
You can't deal
with how hot i am.

1:09:46.783 --> 1:09:48.283
So you need
to get out,

1:09:48.285 --> 1:09:50.185
Because we are over.
I'm breaking up with you.

1:09:50.187 --> 1:09:51.186
No.

1:09:51.188 --> 1:09:53.121
Sorry, i just broke up with you.

1:09:53.123 --> 1:09:54.856

I know we are. It turns out,

1:11:46.903 --> 1:11:49.304
A girl died in the kappa house
20 years ago.

1:11:49.306 --> 1:11:50.605
She gave birth
in a bathtub,

1:11:50.607 --> 1:11:52.273
And the sisters
just let her bleed to death.

1:11:52.275 --> 1:11:53.408
I mean, the best part is

1:11:53.410 --> 1:11:54.475
Dean munsch covered
the whole thing up.

1:11:54.477 --> 1:11:55.910
Huh.

1:11:55.912 --> 1:11:58.579
Maybe these names i found
are related somehow.

1:11:58.581 --> 1:12:00.415
Yeah. Um, they mean...

1:12:00.417 --> 1:12:02.250
Uh, yeah, i mean,
this-this must be it, right?

1:12:02.252 --> 1:12:04.585
It's the 20th anniversary
of-of what happened.

1:12:04.587 --> 1:12:06.721
They're only targeting
kappa sisters.

1:12:08.758 --> 1:12:09.791
Can you please put
some clothes on?

1:12:09.793 --> 1:12:12.327
(stammers)
i'm-i'm sorry, what?

1:12:12.329 --> 1:12:13.428
Um...

1:12:13.430 --> 1:12:15.596
Oh.
(chuckles)

1:12:15.598 --> 1:12:17.332
I'm-i'm so sorry.

1:12:17.334 --> 1:12:18.433
Um...

1:12:18.435 --> 1:12:19.767
Yeah, i think
i'm still kind of...

1:12:19.769 --> 1:12:20.935
Out of it from the... Ah...

1:12:20.937 --> 1:12:22.270
From-from my wound,

1:12:22.272 --> 1:12:23.805
You know?

1:12:23.807 --> 1:12:26.274
Um, they said, uh,
i shouldn't be alone, you know,

1:12:26.276 --> 1:12:27.942
In case i fall asleep and die.

1:12:27.944 --> 1:12:31.813
Can i just get you a robe
or something though? Okay.

1:12:31.815 --> 1:12:33.281
(gasps)

1:12:33.283 --> 1:12:34.682
What?

1:12:35.618 --> 1:12:37.952
What the hell is this?!

1:12:37.954 --> 1:12:42.790
So... I'm the school mascot
during football games.

1:12:42.792 --> 1:12:44.459
What?

1:12:44.461 --> 1:12:46.694
What? What's wr...

1:12:46.696 --> 1:12:48.963
That's the disguise
the killer wears.

1:12:48.965 --> 1:12:51.499
I saw it. He was stalking me
the other night.

1:12:51.501 --> 1:12:52.667
So you're saying i'm the killer?

1:12:52.669 --> 1:12:54.836
I mean, you-you hate kappa,

1:12:54.838 --> 1:12:56.971
Chanel said
you were a crazy stalker,

1:12:56.973 --> 1:12:58.306
And you have
the outfit.

1:12:58.308 --> 1:12:59.974
I thought you were
the one person in this school

1:12:59.976 --> 1:13:01.809
Who knew i was a good guy,
grace.

1:13:01.811 --> 1:13:03.678
That's what that house
does to people.

1:13:03.680 --> 1:13:05.313
Okay, this isn't
about me thinking

1:13:05.315 --> 1:13:06.347
You're boyfriend material.

1:13:06.349 --> 1:13:07.715
But i am boyfriend material.

1:13:07.717 --> 1:13:10.318
How old are you?

1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:11.886
19. I'll be 20 next month.

1:13:11.888 --> 1:13:14.355
Oh, my god. That's exactly

1:13:14.357 --> 1:13:16.357
How old the baby would be
if it grew up.

1:13:16.359 --> 1:13:17.892
No, stay away from me!

1:13:17.894 --> 1:13:20.661
God, i was so gonna go to third
base with you tonight, too.

1:13:20.663 --> 1:13:21.996
Damn it!
Oh, yeah?

1:13:21.998 --> 1:13:24.999
Well, how old are you?
18! God!

1:13:25.001 --> 1:13:27.068
(sighs)

1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:45.920
What if we stapled
their earlobes?

1:13:45.922 --> 1:13:47.355
No. Too easy.

1:13:47.357 --> 1:13:49.023
I only want to
haze these pledges

1:13:49.025 --> 1:13:51.759
If we're gonna haze them
in a fresh, exciting way.

1:13:52.562 --> 1:13:53.861
Boone:
Chanel,

1:13:53.863 --> 1:13:55.029
Can i talk to you?

1:13:55.031 --> 1:13:56.531
In private.

1:13:56.533 --> 1:13:58.733
Private like the parts on a man
you like putting in your mouth?

1:13:58.735 --> 1:13:59.367
(snorts)

1:13:59.369 --> 1:14:01.369
Okay, fine.

1:14:01.371 --> 1:14:02.703
Here goes.

1:14:02.705 --> 1:14:04.739
I know you're gonna destroy
my reputation on campus

1:14:04.741 --> 1:14:06.040
By telling people
i'm a secret gay.

1:14:06.042 --> 1:14:07.875
Mm.
And i'm
gonna get kicked out

1:14:07.877 --> 1:14:09.877
Of the dollar scholars house
with nowhere to live

1:14:09.879 --> 1:14:11.712
Because the world of golf
doesn't really dig

1:14:11.714 --> 1:14:12.914
On gay dudes as a rule.

1:14:12.916 --> 1:14:14.615
You've been talking for a while.

1:14:14.617 --> 1:14:17.785
I want to publicly come out
as gay on my own.

1:14:18.555 --> 1:14:20.621
And then join kappa.
(scoffs)

1:14:20.623 --> 1:14:22.623
I mean, you guys have
to accept everybody, right?
No.

1:14:22.625 --> 1:14:24.559
No, we don't have
to accept gay dudes.

1:14:24.561 --> 1:14:25.426
I actually think

1:14:25.428 --> 1:14:26.394
That's illegal.

1:14:26.396 --> 1:14:28.095
No.

1:14:28.097 --> 1:14:29.964
We're doing it.

1:14:29.966 --> 1:14:32.567
What?! Chanel...
Chanel, that's crazy.

1:14:32.569 --> 1:14:33.901
I am a future
network news anchor.

1:14:33.903 --> 1:14:35.403
That involves

1:14:35.405 --> 1:14:36.737
A little thing called the media,

1:14:36.739 --> 1:14:38.473
Which is, like,
chock-full of gays.

1:14:38.475 --> 1:14:41.909
If i presided over the first
sorority ever to accept a gay,

1:14:41.911 --> 1:14:44.111
Imagine how far that would
get me with my future

1:14:44.113 --> 1:14:46.113
Gay makeup person,
my gay wardrobe person,

1:14:46.115 --> 1:14:47.748
Not to mention my creepy,

1:14:47.750 --> 1:14:49.650
Gross, gay viewers

1:14:49.652 --> 1:14:51.752
And weird, gay higher-ups.
No, no.

1:14:51.754 --> 1:14:53.621
No way. This isn't happening.

1:14:53.623 --> 1:14:56.591
Chanel, you are not
thinking clearly, okay?

1:14:56.593 --> 1:14:59.660
Accepting a gay will hurt
the house, and he's gonna steal

1:14:59.662 --> 1:15:01.662
All of our expensive makeup
and toiletries.

1:15:01.664 --> 1:15:05.099
Boone, chanel is my best friend,

1:15:05.101 --> 1:15:08.002
And if you choose to bring shame
on her and kappa house,

1:15:08.004 --> 1:15:10.938
I will come after you,
do you understand that?

1:15:10.940 --> 1:15:13.174
I will destroy you.

1:15:14.110 --> 1:15:16.110
I trust
you'll consider my offer.

1:15:16.112 --> 1:15:17.745

1:15:21.150 --> 1:15:22.683

You want a shack burger

1:16:06.162 --> 1:16:09.063
You know i want the double.
I want the double.
Okay. You got it.

1:16:17.507 --> 1:16:20.675
Girl, you got that right.
Yeah, hear?

1:16:20.677 --> 1:16:23.077
You got that right.
There some ketchup in there?

1:16:25.014 --> 1:16:26.681
What is it?

1:16:26.683 --> 1:16:28.883
There's someone
in that car out there.

1:16:28.885 --> 1:16:30.518
That's the new security guard.

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:32.186
What? No. Different car.

1:16:32.188 --> 1:16:34.589
Jennifer:
Is that the killer?

1:16:34.591 --> 1:16:36.023
Grace:
No, that's not the killer.

1:16:36.025 --> 1:16:38.192
That's my dad. He's been
keeping an eye on me.

1:16:38.194 --> 1:16:39.760
I'll go talk to him.

1:16:39.762 --> 1:16:41.862
Wait. Let me.

1:16:41.864 --> 1:16:43.864
I'll try to...

You're just, like,
super attractive.

1:17:08.224 --> 1:17:09.256
Um, i'm gigi.

1:17:09.258 --> 1:17:13.227
I'm national president
of kappa kappa tau.

1:17:13.229 --> 1:17:16.230
I was just hanging
with your daughter in there.

1:17:16.232 --> 1:17:18.232
I was like,
"what's he doing?"
oh. (chuckles)

1:17:18.234 --> 1:17:20.067
Um, well, i was trying
to be inconspicuous.

1:17:20.069 --> 1:17:21.802
I-i didn't want
to embarrass her.

1:17:21.804 --> 1:17:24.105
Oh, she's not.
She's very touched.

1:17:24.107 --> 1:17:26.574
Yeah, well, if it was up to me,
i'd pull her out of school.

1:17:26.576 --> 1:17:28.075
I mean, who cares about
losing a year, right?

1:17:28.077 --> 1:17:29.577
It's better than
losing your life.

1:17:29.579 --> 1:17:32.980
My advice, just as a girl...

1:17:32.982 --> 1:17:34.815
Mm-hmm.

1:17:34.817 --> 1:17:36.584
...Maybe give her
some space.

1:17:36.586 --> 1:17:37.952
You know,
my shrink says these kids

1:17:37.954 --> 1:17:40.755
Are the most messed up
of any generation he's seen

1:17:40.757 --> 1:17:44.091
'cause their parents
have made life so easy for them.

1:17:44.093 --> 1:17:46.093
It's like they can't
handle adversity.

1:17:46.095 --> 1:17:47.795
Adversity?

1:17:47.797 --> 1:17:50.264
I wouldn't call a crazed
serial killer adversity.

1:17:50.266 --> 1:17:51.265
They have security.

1:17:51.267 --> 1:17:52.933
Come on.

1:17:52.935 --> 1:17:54.935
Really... Good...

1:17:54.937 --> 1:17:57.271
Good security.

1:17:57.273 --> 1:17:59.607
I don't know. I just...
I just feel like she's, uh...

1:17:59.609 --> 1:18:00.941
She's pulling away from me.

1:18:00.943 --> 1:18:04.211
Actually, like-like
she's pushing me away.

1:18:06.149 --> 1:18:09.950
You know, it's just
part of growing up.

No, that's exactly

Wow.

Hey, do you want to,
like, get a coffee or...?

1:18:47.890 --> 1:18:51.225
Uh, i would love to.

1:18:52.161 --> 1:18:54.095
Cool.

1:18:56.165 --> 1:18:58.232
(engine starts)

1:19:10.913 --> 1:19:14.014
Whoa. What do we have here?

1:19:14.016 --> 1:19:15.883
Look, chanels.

1:19:15.885 --> 1:19:17.785
Someone's got a poo belly.

1:19:21.190 --> 1:19:22.356
(timer dings)
oh!

1:19:22.358 --> 1:19:24.358
Time for another
mayonnaise shot, ladies.

1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:27.194
Hello, hood rat.

1:19:27.196 --> 1:19:29.697
Sweet yeezus, i don't even know
where to begin with you.

1:19:29.699 --> 1:19:31.699
Bitch, i'm about to
smack you so hard,

1:19:31.701 --> 1:19:32.867
Your tampon's gonna pop out.

1:19:32.869 --> 1:19:35.035
Oh. Hold on.

1:19:35.037 --> 1:19:36.203
Number five,

1:19:36.205 --> 1:19:37.238
The pledges are yours.

1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:38.873
I'm gonna go to my room
for a sec

1:19:38.875 --> 1:19:40.708
To fetch some white eyeliner
so i can write

1:19:40.710 --> 1:19:42.042
Legibly here on zayday.

1:19:42.044 --> 1:19:42.977
(chuckles)

1:19:47.884 --> 1:19:48.983
Cheers, ladies.

1:19:50.119 --> 1:19:51.352
(glasses clink)

1:19:56.225 --> 1:19:58.225
(snoring softly)

1:19:58.227 --> 1:20:00.728

1:20:00.730 --> 1:20:02.129
Shondell, did you hear that?

1:20:02.131 --> 1:20:04.131
I heard screaming.

1:20:04.133 --> 1:20:06.400
Shondell,
i'm going in the house.
Mmm.

1:20:06.402 --> 1:20:08.102
Keep your walkie on.

1:20:08.104 --> 1:20:09.470
Shoot.

1:20:12.408 --> 1:20:14.275
Chanel:
<i>He was there!</i>

1:20:14.277 --> 1:20:16.243
He was in my room!
Denise: What's going on?

1:20:16.245 --> 1:20:17.278
I heard screaming.

1:20:17.280 --> 1:20:18.279
A red devil!

1:20:18.281 --> 1:20:19.914
A guy in a red devil costume

1:20:19.916 --> 1:20:21.248
Attacked me!

1:20:21.250 --> 1:20:22.917
<i>I was just looking for</i>
<i>white eyeliner</i>

1:20:22.919 --> 1:20:24.151
<i>So i could draw on zayday,</i>

1:20:24.153 --> 1:20:25.252
<i>When all of a sudden,</i>
<i>there he was,</i>

1:20:25.254 --> 1:20:26.921
<i>Trying to push me out a window.</i>

<i>So you think</i>

1:20:42.004 --> 1:20:44.271
The serial killer
is still up there?
Yes!

1:20:44.273 --> 1:20:46.440
Okay, well, then let's go.
Go where?!

1:20:46.442 --> 1:20:49.143
Upstairs to get the killer
before he gets away!

1:20:49.145 --> 1:20:50.778
Ah! Nah!

1:20:50.780 --> 1:20:51.779
Nah! Nah!

1:20:51.781 --> 1:20:53.013

Nobody get in.

1:21:18.207 --> 1:21:20.808
Nope. I'm... I'm-a have to
