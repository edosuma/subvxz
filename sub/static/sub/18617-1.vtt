03:44.591 --> 03:47.116
- What happened?
- I'm not sure yet.

04:49.255 --> 04:51.780
But I had it with me when I left.
That I know.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.484
You sure you took the right purse?

04:55.595 --> 04:57.495
Well, of course I'm sure.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.588
You saw me put it in.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.860
Look, I must have had my purse picked.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.061
I'm sure of it.

05:04.170 --> 05:07.970
Well, what'll I do, Joey?
Should I go up and see him anyway?

05:08.074 --> 05:10.941
No. Come back right away.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.522
- She's scared.
- She should be.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.592
- Did you get a good look at him?
- Yeah.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.661
Don't lose her.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.391
- Have a seat, Mr. Zara.
- Thank you.

05:33.499 --> 05:36.059
We don't often get a chance
to cooperate with you people...

05:36.169 --> 05:38.660
but if there's anything we can do,
just name it.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.830
- I'm looking for a pickpocket.
- What's his name?

05:40.940 --> 05:42.874
- Don't know.
- We're in trouble.

05:42.975 --> 05:46.103
He stole a wallet out of a woman's purse
on the subway this morning.

05:46.212 --> 05:48.942
- You know what he looks like?
- Mm-hmm.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.016
We're in business.

05:55.021 --> 05:57.012
- So the Commies are mixed up in this.
- Uh-huh.

05:57.123 --> 05:59.318
She's been passing
military information to the agents.

05:59.425 --> 06:02.360
- You know the man she was to pass the stuff to?
- Nope.

06:02.462 --> 06:05.022
Got a line on everybody else
in the picture, except him.

06:05.131 --> 06:08.623
He's Mr. Big.
Carts the stuff out of the country.

06:08.735 --> 06:13.035
All we know is, as soon as he gets his hands
on that film, he'll cross the ocean with it.

06:13.139 --> 06:15.164
So that's the way it happened.

06:17.677 --> 06:22.410
- It's just one of those tough breaks, Joey.
- Hmm.

06:22.515 --> 06:25.848
- Well, I'm sorry.
- We've got to find him.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.386
In New York?
You're crazy.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.479
We've got to find that film.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.081
Film?

06:33.192 --> 06:36.821
Yeah. That's right.

06:36.929 --> 06:39.625
That's what you were carrying
in your wallet.

06:39.732 --> 06:41.859
You know what was on that film?

06:41.968 --> 06:44.459
- A new patent for a chemical formula.
- So?

06:44.570 --> 06:47.095
Candy, it's the most important patent
we've ever had.

06:47.206 --> 06:50.437
- What are you getting so excited about?
- Because we can't get another copy of it!

06:50.543 --> 06:53.637
Joey, you're talking like it was hot.

06:55.014 --> 06:57.642
How many times do I have to tell you,
we're not criminals.

06:59.318 --> 07:01.343
This is big business.

07:01.454 --> 07:03.786
Cutthroat business.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.518
- And I'm in a spot.
- Well...

07:06.626 --> 07:08.594
I told ya,
I'm sorry it happened...

07:08.694 --> 07:10.662
but there's nothin' I can do about it.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.561
So you just tell your boss
I had my bag picked.

07:13.666 --> 07:17.397
Wait a minute.
You're not walking out on me now.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.471
Look, we made a deal.
You promised me.

07:19.572 --> 07:21.802
- No more deliveries after we broke up.
- That's right.

07:21.908 --> 07:24.103
And you promised to make
this last one for me.

07:24.210 --> 07:27.839
Well, sure, I did.
But I can't help it if some guy-

07:27.947 --> 07:31.849
Look, look. Wait a minute.
Candy, you're a smart girl.

07:32.985 --> 07:37.319
- You can figure out a way to find him.
- But I don't know anything about pickpockets.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.721
Well, you've knocked around a lot.

07:39.826 --> 07:43.227
- You know people who know people.
- You gonna throw that in my face again?

07:43.329 --> 07:46.560
Look, Candy, you've got to help me.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.600
You know what he looks like.

07:48.701 --> 07:51.192
If I had your contacts,
I wouldn't be begging like this.

07:53.773 --> 07:57.504
Well, maybe I can get ya a lead.

07:57.610 --> 08:01.979
Candy, if you can find that pickpocket for me,
I'll never bother ya again. Never.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.641
I promise ya.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.389
All right, Joey.

08:15.127 --> 08:18.028
We have a thousand photos to go through...

08:18.130 --> 08:21.031
and from here on in,
it's anybody's guess.

08:21.133 --> 08:23.101
How long do you think it'll take?

08:23.202 --> 08:25.693
Maybe the rest of the day.
Maybe all night.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.672
- Who knows?
- Is there a faster method?

08:29.742 --> 08:34.076
Well, there is one character
who can help us out.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.477
Maybe. Not exactly kosher.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.779
- We're fighting time.
- Well, no harm trying.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.480
Maybe Moe can speed this up a little.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.988
Who's Moe?

08:49.395 --> 08:51.363
Hello, Moe.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.371
Who's the creep?
What's he in for?

08:59.472 --> 09:02.100
He looks like a second-story cat thief.

09:02.208 --> 09:06.269
I got a polka-dot job that was
just made for your personality, Tiger.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.509
- We gotta get quick action.
- Everything around here is always an emergency.

09:10.616 --> 09:13.744
Hey. This got something to do with homicide?

09:13.853 --> 09:16.947
- No.
- I got no killers on my table.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.752
I'm gonna stay in business
long enough to feed this kitty.

09:19.859 --> 09:23.090
- How's she doing?
- Gettin' fat.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.857
I got almost enough
to buy the stone and the plot.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.490
If you lost that kitty,
it's potter's field.

09:28.601 --> 09:32.298
This I do not think
is a very funny joke, Captain Tiger.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.966
I just meant you ought to be careful
how you carry your bankroll.

09:36.075 --> 09:40.512
Look, Tiger, if-
if I was to be buried in potter's field...

09:41.547 --> 09:43.811
it'd just about kill me.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.976
L- I got a hole picked out on Long Island.
It's private.

09:47.086 --> 09:50.146
You gotta be screened
before they'll let them put you in there.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.224
That's how exclusive it is.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.352
- What's the score?
- Don't know yet.

09:56.462 --> 09:59.795
We're looking for a cannon who
binged a girl on the subway for a wallet.

09:59.899 --> 10:02.094
Well, ain't he pigeonholed
with the moll-buzzers?

10:02.201 --> 10:05.261
No. And we haven't got time
to go through all those files.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.635
I thought maybe
you knew of some first-rate grifters...

10:07.740 --> 10:10.834
who've been working the subway
for the last 24 hours.

10:10.943 --> 10:15.778
I happen to know a couple of live cannons
that's been playing the subway the last week.

10:15.881 --> 10:18.042
Business has been droppin'.

10:19.251 --> 10:22.414
- You the victim's old man?
- No, he's the big thumb.

10:24.690 --> 10:27.818
A stripe job would give you
more personality, mister.

10:27.927 --> 10:30.555
- Did you get a good look at the grifter?
- Yes.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.325
- Uh, medium height -
- Ah, medium.

10:33.432 --> 10:36.299
Short, tall, light, dark, fat, skinny.

10:36.402 --> 10:39.462
Thousands of cannons look like that.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.733
It's the technique.

10:41.841 --> 10:45.174
Every one of them's got his own trademark.

10:45.277 --> 10:47.973
Ah, look what that does for him, Tiger.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.480
- It's yours for a buck.
- All right.

10:50.583 --> 10:53.211
Uh, tell me, mister,
when'd this happen?

10:53.319 --> 10:55.446
A couple of hours ago.

10:55.554 --> 10:59.217
Was he standing to the left of her,
the right of her or behind her?

10:59.325 --> 11:02.294
Behind her.
Then he moved around and faced her.

11:02.395 --> 11:05.193
- Carrying a newspaper?
- Yes.

11:05.297 --> 11:09.461
- Rolled up or folded?
- Folded, I think.

11:09.568 --> 11:11.968
What do you mean, you think?

11:12.071 --> 11:14.471
What kind of a big thumb
have we got here, Tiger?

11:14.573 --> 11:16.700
Listen, mister, you gotta be sure.

11:16.809 --> 11:19.869
I tell ya, all these cannons
have their own way of doing things.

11:19.979 --> 11:22.379
All right, all right.
It was folded.

11:22.481 --> 11:25.109
The top side, was it the front page
or the classified ads?

11:25.217 --> 11:27.947
- Classified.
- Was he a southpaw?

11:28.054 --> 11:31.023
No, he used his right hand.
He held the paper in his left.

11:31.123 --> 11:35.685
- Did he hold it an angle, like this?
- Yes.

11:35.795 --> 11:38.263
- Did you see him close the purse?
- Yes.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.629
Did he put the paper over it like this
when he closed it?

11:41.734 --> 11:43.702
Yes.

11:47.740 --> 11:51.540
#And the violins were soft and sweet #

11:51.644 --> 11:53.771
#And so was I ##

11:56.615 --> 11:59.709
- I know.
- Mr. Zara, wait outside.

11:59.819 --> 12:02.481
- Well, but -
- It'll take me just a minute.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.284
Moe, we gotta work fast.

12:05.391 --> 12:08.087
Look, let's not go into that again.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.321
Look, what do you want from me, Tiger?

12:10.429 --> 12:15.731
Do I personally raise the price on hamburgers
and pork and beans and frankfurters?

12:15.835 --> 12:18.963
Is it my fault
that the cost of living is going up?

12:19.071 --> 12:22.666
These are the prices as of this morning.

12:22.775 --> 12:25.369
When the cost of living goes up,
my prices go up.

12:25.478 --> 12:29.175
When the cost of living goes down,
my prices go down.

12:29.281 --> 12:32.944
In my book, the price on the board
for a cannon is, uh...

12:33.052 --> 12:35.020
$50.

12:35.121 --> 12:38.716
$50? I told you before.
We got no kitty.

12:38.824 --> 12:42.555
And you're such a millionaire's salary
that you can afford to pay me for all my tips?

12:42.661 --> 12:44.629
$35.

12:46.132 --> 12:51.069
Tell you what I'll do, Tiger. I'll give you
the names of eight cannons that fit the job.

12:51.170 --> 12:56.233
And I'll bet you $38.50 that one of them
buzzed this moll's wallet.

12:56.342 --> 12:58.333
I'll bet you 38.50 you're wrong.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.438
- Mr. Zara.
- Yes?

13:17.396 --> 13:19.887
Skip McCoy.

13:19.999 --> 13:23.230
For a three-time loser
who's been out only a week...

13:23.335 --> 13:25.496
he's begging for a fourth conviction.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.595
Well, he's gotta live, too.

13:27.706 --> 13:30.971
There's one cannon
I'd like to see get the chair.

13:36.882 --> 13:39.942
- That's the man.
- We haven't even got a lead on him.

13:40.052 --> 13:43.954
So you don't know, Tiger.
Thought you knew everything about everybody.

13:44.056 --> 13:46.854
Ah, he hasn't been out
long enough to settle.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.154
I know how he operates.

13:49.261 --> 13:51.957
He's holed up somewhere.

13:52.064 --> 13:54.259
A smart cannon lives quietly...

13:54.366 --> 13:56.926
don't advertise
when he's just scored on a job.

13:57.036 --> 13:59.004
Especially an ex-con like Skip.

13:59.104 --> 14:02.232
He always had a knack for living
in out-of-way places -

14:02.341 --> 14:04.434
places hard to find.

14:04.543 --> 14:09.310
It's gonna be pretty hard to run him down,
the places he picks.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.713
Might take you almost a week
to run him down.

14:11.817 --> 14:13.785
What are you angling for, a side bet?

14:13.886 --> 14:16.218
Well, every extra buck
has a meaning all its own.

14:16.322 --> 14:19.052
It just so happens
I haven't got a red cent left.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.456
Just so happens
I know where he's shacked up.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.494
- That's part of the bet.
- Listen, Tiger...

14:23.596 --> 14:26.429
do you realize that the cost of living
has gone up 50%?

14:26.532 --> 14:29.126
- Moe, I got no more time.
- Then what are you stalling for?

14:29.235 --> 14:32.727
- Why don't you make me a pitch?
- Next time I'll give you odds - 2-to-1.

14:32.838 --> 14:34.738
- It's a promise?
- Yeah.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.673
Well, all right, what are we
standing here for gibbling and gabbling?

14:51.223 --> 14:53.453
Thanks, pal.

16:52.778 --> 16:54.905
Well, hello, Winoki, Mac.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.915
- This a visit or a pickup?
- Both. Tiger wants to see ya.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.247
- You go with Mac. I'll stick around.
- Sure.

17:00.352 --> 17:04.049
- Still hoarding all your loot, Skip?
- Take a look around. You're getting paid for it.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.954
- You want a beer?
- Sure, I'll have a beer.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.529
- How's the whip?
- You know the whip - always in the pink.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.723
Yeah. I got no electricity here,
but the beer's always cold.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.233
- You want one, Mac?
- Tiger's waitin'.

17:17.336 --> 17:20.031
Okay. Here's the opener.

17:20.138 --> 17:22.300
Come on. Let's go.

17:22.407 --> 17:25.036
Oh, uh, Winoki, just two things.

17:25.144 --> 17:28.477
After you give my place the broom,
leave it the way you found it, huh?

17:28.580 --> 17:32.311
And when you got enough beer,
lower my icebox back in the drink.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.386
Come on, Mac.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.425
He's here.

17:50.536 --> 17:54.632
That's fast work.
I hope he didn't throw that microfilm away.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.335
- How do you want to handle this?
- He got me suspended twice for smacking him.

17:58.444 --> 18:02.346
Cost me six months' pay.
Do you mind waiting outside?

18:02.448 --> 18:04.609
I want to handle this my way.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.684
Sure.

18:13.292 --> 18:16.261
I was picked up.
No resistance.

18:16.361 --> 18:19.694
- You better make this stick.
- You only been out a week...

18:19.798 --> 18:22.358
and right away those fingers
gotta play the subway circuit.

18:22.468 --> 18:25.460
What did you do with the wallet
you lifted from the girl?

18:25.571 --> 18:28.369
Back up the pinch with a charge
or drive me back to my shack.

18:28.474 --> 18:31.637
I'll drive you back in a hearse
if you don't get that kink out of your mouth.

18:31.743 --> 18:33.643
Now, look, buster...

18:33.745 --> 18:35.872
you've been whip of this squad
long enough to know...

18:35.981 --> 18:39.178
that a guy with my rating
wouldn't grift a dame on the train -

18:39.284 --> 18:41.218
not with three strikes on me.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.312
Ah, you'll always be a two-bit cannon.

18:44.423 --> 18:48.587
And when they pick you up in the gutter dead,
your hand'll be in a drunk's pocket.

18:48.694 --> 18:51.492
- You were spotted lifting that wallet.
- Only amateurs are spotted.

18:51.597 --> 18:54.998
- So?
- So it's my word against one of your whiz cops.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.797
That girl was carrying T.N.T.,
and it's gonna blow up right in your face.

19:00.239 --> 19:03.731
- What girl?
- I'm gonna jam that grin right down your teeth.

19:03.842 --> 19:07.744
Go ahead, slug me. Go ahead.
I'll make a bigger stink than last time.

19:07.846 --> 19:11.077
I'll see you hit the backyard
without pay for one year.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.845
Go on, knothead. Slug me. Come on, hit me!

19:13.952 --> 19:16.512
Come on, hit me, will ya?
What's the matter? You nervous?

19:16.622 --> 19:18.590
- Come on.
- Zara.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.818
All we want is the wallet.
If you got rid of it, tell us.

19:21.927 --> 19:24.555
- If you tossed the film away, tell us where.
- Who's he?

19:24.663 --> 19:26.563
None of your business.
Just answer the man.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.930
Now, wait a minute.
I've been clean ever since I got out last week.

19:30.035 --> 19:33.368
Wouldn't touch a nickel if it was
laying in the street. Word of honor.

19:33.472 --> 19:37.033
Why don't you haul that girl down here
to identify me? It's my word against hers.

19:37.142 --> 19:40.942
No. It's your word against mine.
I saw you close her purse.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.116
All right. So it's your word.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.549
But you gotta nail the goods on me,
and I'm clean.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.553
Go ahead. Fan me.
Give me the works.

19:49.655 --> 19:52.385
That film you stole had government
information on it - classified.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.925
We've been following this girl for months.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.461
And just as we were about to
grab a top Red agent...

19:57.563 --> 20:00.760
receiving the film from her,
you broke up the ball game.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.766
Can't you see how important this is?

20:02.868 --> 20:05.428
We just want your cooperation,
and the charges will be dropped.

20:05.537 --> 20:08.438
- Isn't that right, Captain?
- I'd like to make this rap stick...

20:08.540 --> 20:10.508
but what he's got to do is more important.

20:10.609 --> 20:14.306
You boys are talking in the wrong corner.
I'm just a guy keeping my hands in my pockets.

20:14.413 --> 20:18.873
If you refuse to cooperate, you'll be as guilty
as the traitors that gave Stalin the A-bomb.

20:20.319 --> 20:24.312
- Are you waving the flag at me?
- I know something inside you should give.

20:25.357 --> 20:28.485
And I know you pinched me three times,
got me convicted three times...

20:28.594 --> 20:30.494
and made me a three-time loser.

20:30.596 --> 20:33.030
And I know you took an oath
to put me away for life.

20:33.131 --> 20:37.397
Well, you're trying awful hard
with all this patriotic eyewash, but get this:

20:37.502 --> 20:41.438
I didn't grift that film,
and you can't prove I did.

20:41.540 --> 20:46.136
And if I said I did, you'd slap that fourth rap across
my teeth no matter what promises you made.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.805
- Do you know what treason means?
- Who cares?

20:48.914 --> 20:52.543
- Answer the man!
- Is there a law now I gotta listen to lectures?

20:53.719 --> 20:56.552
MacGregor, get him out of here.

20:56.655 --> 20:58.680
Get him out of this building.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.690
Hello.

21:00.792 --> 21:04.592
If that's Winoki,
ask him if he put my beer back on ice, huh?

21:06.131 --> 21:09.430
Hey, Willie, what've you been
feeding the Tiger lately?

21:09.534 --> 21:11.468
Watch it, bud.

22:09.361 --> 22:11.352
Going up, please.

22:44.629 --> 22:47.723
- May I help you?
- I'd like to see a copy of the New York Times...

22:47.833 --> 22:50.165
January 5, 1947.

22:50.268 --> 22:52.361
- Fill this out, please.
- Sure.

24:05.877 --> 24:09.608
- So, who told you to ask me?
- The pinboy in the bowling alley.

24:09.714 --> 24:11.682
So who told you to ask him?

24:11.783 --> 24:15.048
The fella that works at
the Houston Street Auction Shop.

24:15.153 --> 24:17.053
So why didn't you go to the cops?

24:17.155 --> 24:21.524
Look, 20 bucks if you tell me
where I can find Lightning Louie.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.220
- Put it on the table.
- Not till you tell me.

24:34.439 --> 24:37.966
- I'm Lightning Louie.
- Then why'd you tell me your name was Godkin?

24:38.076 --> 24:42.137
Look, blubbermouth, you give me back
my dough or there's gonna be trouble.

24:42.247 --> 24:44.340
Lum.

24:44.449 --> 24:47.816
- What's my name?
- Uptown or downtown?

24:47.919 --> 24:51.116
- My downtown name.
- Lightning Louie.

24:51.223 --> 24:56.251
For another 20 I'll give you the name of the stoolie
who knows everything about cannons.

24:56.361 --> 24:58.329
I hope you bust.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.996
174 Bowery.

25:12.244 --> 25:16.772
Over a tattoo shop.
One flight up, head of the stairs.

25:16.882 --> 25:19.214
Her name is Moe.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.376
A woman?

25:21.486 --> 25:23.386
Tell her I sent ya.

25:23.488 --> 25:27.356
Lum, bring me another order of chow fun.

25:27.459 --> 25:29.359
Cha siu bow.

25:52.851 --> 25:54.751
Who is it?

25:54.853 --> 25:57.219
Lightning Louie sent me.

26:00.058 --> 26:02.856
- Who?
- Lightning Louie.

26:04.796 --> 26:07.697
- Are you Moe?
- Who are you?

26:07.799 --> 26:12.634
You've been recommended as the best
pickpocket stoolie in the business.

26:12.737 --> 26:16.264
What kind of talk is that,
calling me a stoolie?

26:16.374 --> 26:20.333
I was brought up to report
any injustice to the police authorities.

26:20.445 --> 26:22.845
I call that being a solid citizen.

26:22.948 --> 26:24.882
But you get paid for it.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.974
You're gonna knock it?

26:27.085 --> 26:31.215
I'm looking for the pickpocket who lifted
my wallet in the subway this morning.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.223
Oh.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.520
- So you're the muffin.
- What do you mean?

26:35.627 --> 26:39.063
Oh, one cannon talks to another,
word gets around.

26:39.164 --> 26:42.156
What was in the wallet?
That's pretty.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.430
- Something personal.
- How personal?

26:45.537 --> 26:49.303
What difference does it make?
He didn't know what was in it when he took it.

26:49.407 --> 26:51.432
How do you know?

26:51.543 --> 26:53.511
You got a boyfriend?

26:53.612 --> 26:55.580
- Why?
- Like to buy him a tie?

26:55.680 --> 26:59.639
I happen to carry a complete line
of personality neckwear.

26:59.751 --> 27:05.087
- Bargain prices.
- Look, I'll tell you all the facts - nothing else.

27:05.190 --> 27:09.058
- Now, you want to do business?
- You got any happy money on you?

27:09.160 --> 27:11.060
"Happy money"?

27:11.162 --> 27:14.654
Yeah. Money that's gonna
make me feel happy. What else?

27:14.766 --> 27:16.734
How happy?

27:18.803 --> 27:20.771
$50.

28:37.649 --> 28:40.277
Hey.

29:31.703 --> 29:34.331
Take your time looking.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.134
Want a beer?

29:43.181 --> 29:45.149
I want my wallet.

29:46.785 --> 29:50.346
- What wallet?
- The one you lifted from my bag today.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.549
Oh, now,
do I look like a pickpocket?

29:53.658 --> 29:56.923
You sure do.

30:01.099 --> 30:03.090
Wipe your face off.

30:04.569 --> 30:07.333
How much did Moe get out of ya?

30:07.438 --> 30:09.338
Huh?

30:10.875 --> 30:13.469
I figure you shelled out
about 50 bucks to find me...

30:13.578 --> 30:15.637
if I know Moe.

30:16.881 --> 30:18.974
Huh?

30:19.083 --> 30:22.177
Moe's all right. She's gotta eat.

30:23.788 --> 30:25.722
Crummy tie.

30:25.824 --> 30:29.351
- Look, did you throw it away?
- Hmm?

30:29.460 --> 30:31.985
Mr. McCoy, I gotta find that wallet.

30:32.096 --> 30:36.157
- Why?
- It's no good to you or to anybody else.

30:36.267 --> 30:39.259
No?

30:39.370 --> 30:41.361
What's the matter,
I bust somethin'?

30:41.472 --> 30:43.940
- I think I'm sick.
- Sit down. Let's see.

30:45.376 --> 30:47.844
Find out the trouble.

30:47.946 --> 30:49.914
Oh!

30:50.014 --> 30:52.278
That's where it hurts.

30:52.383 --> 30:54.749
Let's fix it up.
You just relax.

30:58.523 --> 31:01.048
All right now, muffin.

31:01.159 --> 31:03.457
Let's have a small dose of straight talk.

31:03.561 --> 31:06.325
There was some film in it.

31:06.431 --> 31:10.265
You mean you ransacked my joint
just to find some film?

31:10.368 --> 31:12.962
You got me in an awful mess
when you took it.

31:13.071 --> 31:16.370
What kind of a mess?
You workin' for some blackmailer?

31:16.474 --> 31:20.467
Oh, no. Nothing like that, Mr. McCoy.

31:20.578 --> 31:23.138
They're pictures of my brother Mickey.

31:23.248 --> 31:26.911
He's a war hero in Korea,
and my mother's waiting to see them.

31:27.018 --> 31:30.886
Uh-huh. Why didn't you
go to the cops, honey?

31:30.989 --> 31:33.184
Well, I got in a little trouble with them...

31:33.291 --> 31:36.852
and... it'd kill my mother if she -

31:38.730 --> 31:40.994
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, sure.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.994
Feel better?

31:45.103 --> 31:47.503
Does, uh, beer always do this to you?

31:47.605 --> 31:52.440
What kind of trouble did you get into
with the cops, muffin?

31:52.543 --> 31:55.512
- Oh, a girl makes mistakes.
- Mm-hmm.

31:56.981 --> 32:00.314
- I was only asking 'cause, uh -
- 'Cause what?

32:22.740 --> 32:24.731
Yeah.

32:26.144 --> 32:29.409
You look for oil,
sometimes you hit a gusher.

32:29.514 --> 32:31.482
Am I talking too much?

32:31.582 --> 32:33.777
Why talk?

32:35.286 --> 32:37.914
How much is your brother worth?

32:39.490 --> 32:41.458
What do you want? Blood?

32:41.559 --> 32:44.790
I just want to make your old lady happy.
That's all.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.832
Then you do have it.

32:51.936 --> 32:54.029
We'll just see, muffin.

32:54.138 --> 32:58.541
There might be another little old lady
looking for pictures of her boy.

32:59.577 --> 33:02.045
I gotta make sure it's your brother Mickey.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.645
- I'll tell my mother.
- You do that.

33:37.448 --> 33:39.416
That's the girl.

33:44.956 --> 33:47.516
I'll check with you later.

33:55.733 --> 34:00.602
Hello, Tiger. You're waking up
half the waterfront with those clodhoppers.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.071
- You're not losing any time.
- Neither are you.

34:03.174 --> 34:05.404
- Did you make a deal?
- Go on, drum up a charge.

34:05.510 --> 34:08.001
Throw me in.
You've done it before.

34:08.112 --> 34:11.275
Locking you up isn't gonna help.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.714
You're sittin' on a hot rock, ain't ya?

34:13.818 --> 34:15.786
I'd like to see you jump.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.685
I promised to drop the pickpocket charge
if you played ball.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.882
All right, so it's bush league to you.

34:20.992 --> 34:23.960
Now I'm gonna give you big-league stuff.

34:24.062 --> 34:28.795
I'd rather chop my leg off than say what I came
to say, but I gotta push personal feelings aside.

34:28.900 --> 34:32.266
I'm going to the commissioner himself,
and I'm gonna ask him to whitewash you.

34:32.370 --> 34:34.270
Me. Personally.

34:34.371 --> 34:37.933
I'm gonna beg him to give you a clean slate.
No more three-time loser for you, Skip.

34:38.042 --> 34:41.306
A nice, fat bill of health
for that strip of film.

34:41.411 --> 34:44.404
That's what I'm gonna ask him to do.

34:44.514 --> 34:47.245
You're gonna ask him?
Who you kidding?

34:47.351 --> 34:51.411
You guys sat yourselves down
at a long table, tried to figure out an angle.

34:51.522 --> 34:53.489
Your idea, huh?

34:53.591 --> 34:57.322
You mean the commissioner's idea
and all the big wheels in the department.

34:57.428 --> 34:59.362
All right, Skip. I won't push it.

34:59.464 --> 35:01.489
But just remember,
if it's the last thing I do...

35:01.599 --> 35:04.864
no matter what happens about this
Commie setup, I'm gonna see that ya get it.

35:04.969 --> 35:08.063
Hey, Tiger,
save the taxpayers some money.

35:08.172 --> 35:11.198
Don't plant a wire in here,
'cause I'll tear it out.

35:11.309 --> 35:13.277
Good-bye.

35:17.715 --> 35:21.674
- Did you find him? Has he got it?
- Yeah, but he knows what's on it.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.914
Oh, what I had to go through
to run that guy down.

35:26.023 --> 35:28.787
Professional stool pigeon
clipped me for 50 bucks.

35:28.893 --> 35:33.830
She calls herself Moe,
operates at 174 Bowery.

35:33.931 --> 35:35.865
Sells ties as a front.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.992
What do you mean
he knows what's on it?

35:39.303 --> 35:43.034
The way he hung onto it.
He's been around.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.701
Did he say what's on the film?

35:45.810 --> 35:48.040
He's shaking you down.
That tells the story.

35:49.213 --> 35:53.081
- Did you - Did you mention my name?
- No.

35:53.184 --> 35:55.709
- Does he know where I live?
- What are you getting excited about?

35:55.820 --> 35:59.256
You should be celebrating.
I found him for you, didn't I?

36:00.491 --> 36:02.857
And he's got what you want.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.827
So I'll give you his address,
and you go over and make a deal.

36:05.930 --> 36:06.919
No.

36:08.533 --> 36:11.263
No, I - I can't take a chance.

36:11.369 --> 36:15.169
Well, I like that. You can't take a chance,
but you send me over there.

36:15.273 --> 36:18.470
- It's different with you, Candy.
- In what way?

36:18.576 --> 36:22.979
Well, he - he might have been
hired for the job.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.674
- You think he knew what he was stealing?
- Could be.

36:25.783 --> 36:29.844
Well, then, why didn't he contact you?
It makes no sense to me.

36:29.954 --> 36:32.946
He might be playing both ends
against the middle. Don't you see?

36:33.057 --> 36:35.321
No, I don't see.

36:36.494 --> 36:40.362
But then, maybe there's something
about that film that you haven't told me.

36:40.464 --> 36:43.456
- What do you mean by that?
- You tell me.

36:43.568 --> 36:47.026
There's nothing very complicated
about it, Candy. It's -

36:47.138 --> 36:51.472
It's just that if he knew I was after the film,
he'd increase the price. That's all.

36:51.576 --> 36:53.908
I told you I was in a cutthroat business.

36:54.011 --> 36:56.878
These manufacturers would do anything
to eliminate each other.

36:56.981 --> 36:58.949
That's the reason I've gotta keep out of it.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.245
And that's the reason
you've gotta go back to him.

37:01.352 --> 37:04.253
Well, I'm not going back to that guy.

37:05.556 --> 37:09.390
- He clipped me on the jaw.
- Look, this is all part of your last delivery.

37:10.494 --> 37:13.122
You started this job.
Now finish it.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.366
Here.

37:16.467 --> 37:18.799
Here's 500.

37:18.903 --> 37:20.928
Offer him 50.

37:21.038 --> 37:23.973
If he holds out for more,
give him another 50.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.066
Whatever's left is yours.

37:30.681 --> 37:33.206
You can buy a lot of dresses with $400.

37:34.518 --> 37:36.850
You've gotta come back with it, Candy.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.945
I'll wait for you in the office.

37:47.898 --> 37:51.197
Hey. I'm down here.

37:51.302 --> 37:53.532
The stairs are behind the hammock.

38:05.416 --> 38:08.749
- Where's your old lady?
- She couldn't come.

38:08.853 --> 38:11.549
Oh, that's too bad.
You got the cabbage?

38:11.656 --> 38:13.851
Uh-huh.

38:13.958 --> 38:15.949
I just can't figure you out.

38:16.060 --> 38:19.223
Don't try. Let your old lady do all the figurin'.
How much she give you?

38:19.330 --> 38:23.960
How come a nice guy like you goes around
picking handbags on the subway?

38:24.068 --> 38:28.027
Muffin, the last time I worked the subway,
I was in short pants.

38:29.173 --> 38:31.073
The last time was this morning...

38:31.175 --> 38:33.405
unless you got
a couple of extra licks in between.

38:33.511 --> 38:35.479
Oh, don't be that way.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.376
How many times you been caught
with your hand where it doesn't belong?

38:41.485 --> 38:43.453
Well, I tell ya, baby...

38:43.554 --> 38:45.920
whenever I'm caught,
it's always an accident.

38:46.023 --> 38:48.787
Like, uh, maybe I don't
feel so good, you know.

38:48.893 --> 38:51.384
Or maybe I'm not concentratin'.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.861
I've been tapped
a couple, three times.

38:53.964 --> 38:56.125
- Three times?
- Yeah, that's part of the business.

38:56.233 --> 38:58.599
Red side of the ledger.
Want a smoke?

38:58.703 --> 39:02.298
Sure. I once knew a -

39:02.406 --> 39:05.375
I mean, I once heard
of a fella who was in -

39:07.011 --> 39:08.945
who was in jail three times.

39:10.047 --> 39:12.607
The next time they arrested him,
they locked him up for good.

39:12.717 --> 39:15.743
That's the way it goes.
There's a law about three-time losers.

39:15.853 --> 39:18.253
- Fourth conviction means life.
- You mean...

39:18.356 --> 39:21.257
if they'd caught you this morning,
picking my purse...

39:21.359 --> 39:24.089
you could be sent up for life?

39:24.195 --> 39:26.891
Nothin' happens
when I'm concentratin'.

39:31.168 --> 39:33.295
You're a dope, taking chances like that.

39:33.404 --> 39:35.838
How much money do you think
people carry around?

39:35.940 --> 39:38.101
- How's the chin?
- Fine.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.177
Good.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.908
- You got fingers like an artist.
- Mm-hmm.

39:46.016 --> 39:49.417
- Soft and smooth.
- In my business, I gotta keep 'em that way.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.717
And when they stay empty, they get nervous.
Come on, come on.

39:55.092 --> 39:57.617
How'd you get to be a pickpocket?

39:59.063 --> 40:01.463
How did I get to be a pickpocket?

40:01.565 --> 40:03.556
How'd you get to be what you are?

40:03.667 --> 40:05.567
Things happen. That's how.

40:05.669 --> 40:09.105
- Oh, look, don't get sore.
- Well, don't ask stupid questions.

40:09.206 --> 40:12.073
I only ask 'cause...

40:12.176 --> 40:14.235
I'm interested.

40:14.345 --> 40:16.472
Interested, huh?

40:19.183 --> 40:22.346
How much is it worth to ya?

40:22.453 --> 40:24.853
What are you pushing me for?

40:24.955 --> 40:26.980
You came here to buy, didn't you?

40:35.800 --> 40:38.928
You're not gonna raise the ante
by smearing my lipstick.

40:39.036 --> 40:40.936
Then why the pitch?

40:42.440 --> 40:45.876
- 'Cause I really like you.
- Yeah? Why?

40:45.976 --> 40:48.877
Everybody likes everybody
when they're kissing.

40:48.979 --> 40:53.279
- And everybody's always different.
- So tomorrow you'll like somebody else.

40:54.985 --> 40:57.317
I've kissed a lot of guys.

40:57.421 --> 41:01.380
But, honest, Skip, I never felt like this.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.926
You're talking like you got a fever.

41:11.402 --> 41:13.996
I know what you mean now.

41:14.104 --> 41:16.629
Look for oil and you hit a gusher.

41:24.181 --> 41:26.741
How much did you bring?

41:26.851 --> 41:28.751
I don't want to talk about it.

41:30.688 --> 41:32.588
How much?

41:33.624 --> 41:35.819
500.

41:38.596 --> 41:42.760
You tell that Commie I want a big score
for that film, and I want it in cash.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.732
- Tonight.
- What are you talkin' about?

41:44.835 --> 41:47.497
You tell me. You people are supposed
to have all the answers.

41:47.605 --> 41:50.335
- Tell you what? I don't -
- Come on. Drop the act.

41:50.441 --> 41:54.605
So you're a Red. Who cares?
Your money's as good as anybody else's.

41:54.712 --> 41:58.113
Now get your stern up those stairs
and tell your old lady what I want.

41:58.215 --> 42:00.115
- A Red?
- Take off!

42:00.217 --> 42:02.845
- You think I'm a Red? Me?
- I don't think anything. I know.

42:02.953 --> 42:04.853
I know what you're after.
I know what it's worth.

42:04.955 --> 42:07.446
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You know, all right.

42:07.558 --> 42:10.118
But what you don't know
is that when I grifted your wallet...

42:10.227 --> 42:12.127
I was pulled in by the cops.

42:12.229 --> 42:15.062
You know how hard it is to spot
my fingers in action? Can't be done.

42:15.165 --> 42:17.690
But a guy did it. You know how he did it?
He was watchin' you.

42:17.801 --> 42:20.031
And that guy you were supposed
to pass the film to...

42:20.137 --> 42:22.037
you don't know about him either, huh?

42:22.139 --> 42:25.131
- He's still waitin'. He's itchin' for it.
- Look, Skip...

42:25.242 --> 42:27.574
the way I feel about you,
I wouldn't lie to you.

42:27.678 --> 42:30.112
- You gotta believe me.
- I gotta believe nobody.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.978
I'll do business with a Red,
but I don't have to believe one.

42:36.921 --> 42:39.719
I'm sorry, Skip. I -

42:39.823 --> 42:41.723
Get out of here!

42:41.825 --> 42:45.317
Now tell your old lady I'm shaking down
you Reds for 25 grand.

42:45.429 --> 42:47.329
Get goin'!

43:01.445 --> 43:04.005
He slapped me all over the place.

43:04.114 --> 43:05.979
What a line he gave me.

43:07.017 --> 43:09.485
And me falling for it.

43:11.121 --> 43:13.715
Took the 500 right out of my bag.

43:15.559 --> 43:18.551
You know what's crazy
about the whole thing?

43:18.662 --> 43:20.687
You know what he wants?

43:20.798 --> 43:23.392
$25,000.

43:25.769 --> 43:28.260
25,000 for that film.

43:30.507 --> 43:33.567
Did you ever hear of such a crazy thing?

43:33.677 --> 43:36.703
You know why?
You know what he said?

43:36.814 --> 43:40.580
He-He's crazy.

43:41.619 --> 43:45.055
He-He said I was a Commie.

43:45.155 --> 43:48.613
Did you ever hear
of such a thing?

43:48.726 --> 43:50.626
What makes people like that?

43:50.728 --> 43:53.822
Where do they get such ideas?

43:53.931 --> 43:56.559
All right, he wants to shake us down.

43:56.667 --> 43:59.033
- But to start calling us Commies.
- Sit down.

43:59.136 --> 44:01.331
- And you know what else he told me?
- Sit down.

44:08.078 --> 44:11.536
- You should have taken care of him yourself.
- You know I couldn't take a chance.

44:11.649 --> 44:15.050
I know you're getting paid to take them.

44:25.362 --> 44:29.594
Security isn't interested
in all this confusion.

44:39.877 --> 44:43.278
Delivery must be made tomorrow night.

45:00.664 --> 45:03.326
Get that film.

45:14.745 --> 45:18.374
Joey! You can't do it.

45:18.482 --> 45:21.713
- Where does he live?
- I know what kind of a guy he is. He'll kill you.

45:21.819 --> 45:26.119
- Where does he live?
- If you kill him, you'll get the chair.

45:26.223 --> 45:30.057
Joey, I know we're all washed up, but...

45:30.160 --> 45:33.391
I still owe you somethin'
for the break you gave me.

45:33.497 --> 45:36.830
I don't want to see you end up...
on a slab.

45:36.934 --> 45:39.562
All right. I'll find him myself.

45:39.670 --> 45:42.571
- I'll find him the way you did.
- Okay, Joey.

45:43.841 --> 45:45.968
I'll tell ya.

45:46.076 --> 45:47.976
He lives at...

45:48.078 --> 45:51.070
704 West 47 th Street...

45:52.182 --> 45:55.709
near 10th Avenue... in a basement.

45:55.819 --> 45:58.617
I'm going crazy. I -

45:58.722 --> 46:01.714
I didn't know where to go.
L- I didn't know who to talk to.

46:01.825 --> 46:03.884
Why didn't you go to the cops?

46:03.994 --> 46:07.054
Who'd believe I didn't know what I was passing?
Who'd believe me?

46:07.164 --> 46:09.223
Who'd believe me?

46:09.333 --> 46:11.233
Would you believe me?

46:11.335 --> 46:14.532
Do you know what they do to people
who hand out government secrets?

46:14.638 --> 46:17.971
Moe. Y-You got to promise me, Moe.

46:18.075 --> 46:20.873
When Joey asks you,
you don't know where Skip lives.

46:20.978 --> 46:23.708
- He won't find me.
- He knows where you live.

46:23.814 --> 46:26.942
- Well, why ain't he here?
- I gave him a phony address for Skip.

46:27.050 --> 46:28.950
He's lookin' for him now.

46:29.052 --> 46:31.247
So why don't you tell Skip?

46:35.325 --> 46:37.623
He won't believe a word I tell him.

46:37.728 --> 46:41.960
Oh. So he crawled
under your skin, too, huh?

46:43.167 --> 46:46.000
He's as shifty as smoke,
but I love him.

46:46.103 --> 46:48.003
You sold him out for 50 bucks.

46:48.105 --> 46:51.472
Oh, look. Some people peddle apples,
lamb chops, lumber.

46:51.575 --> 46:54.009
I peddle information.

46:54.111 --> 46:56.011
Skip ain't sore.
He understands.

46:56.113 --> 46:59.446
We live in a different kind of a world.

46:59.550 --> 47:03.509
Oh, once in a while,
he gets hot under the collar if I sell him short.

47:04.555 --> 47:06.648
But you wouldn't sell him to a Commie.

47:07.958 --> 47:11.155
What do you think I am, an informer?

47:37.287 --> 47:39.187
Coffee.

47:42.659 --> 47:47.562
Stay away from your shack, Skip.
There's -There's a guy gunnin' for ya.

47:47.664 --> 47:50.394
He won't have any trouble finding me.

47:50.500 --> 47:53.628
Everybody in town knows where I live.

47:53.737 --> 47:55.830
I didn't pinpoint you, honest.

47:55.939 --> 48:00.103
I give Tiger the name of eight cannons,
but that creep that was with him...

48:00.210 --> 48:02.940
he fingered your picture like a shot.

48:03.046 --> 48:05.207
Mm-hmm.

48:05.315 --> 48:09.046
Confidentially, it sounded like
your kind of an act.

48:09.152 --> 48:11.586
You think so, huh?

48:11.688 --> 48:15.385
How much did you raise on me
for your stone and plot?

48:15.492 --> 48:20.259
Oh, don't be sore. They'd have caught up
with you in a couple of hours anyways.

48:20.364 --> 48:23.822
I... just chopped down
on the time a little.

48:23.934 --> 48:26.425
That was mighty nice of ya.

48:26.536 --> 48:28.970
Who's gunning for me?

48:30.007 --> 48:34.444
What's the matter with you,
playin' footsies with the Commies?

48:34.544 --> 48:37.206
You wavin' the flag, too?

48:37.314 --> 48:39.305
Listen. I know you since
you was a little kid.

48:39.416 --> 48:42.112
You was always a regular kind of crook. I -

48:42.219 --> 48:46.747
- I never figured you for a louse.
- Stop. You're breakin' my heart.

48:46.857 --> 48:50.759
Even in our crummy kind of business,
you gotta draw the line somewheres.

48:51.862 --> 48:55.764
That muffin you grifted, she's okay.

48:57.167 --> 48:59.465
Stuck her chin way out for you.

48:59.569 --> 49:01.469
She's -

49:03.640 --> 49:07.303
Hey, you look tired, Moe.
You better go home.

49:07.411 --> 49:09.311
Go on.

49:16.053 --> 49:19.352
Stop using your hands, Skip, and...

49:19.456 --> 49:21.617
start using your head.

49:23.627 --> 49:25.527
The kid loves you.

49:28.365 --> 49:31.664
- Bye, Skip.
- See ya, Moe.

49:41.979 --> 49:44.641
Tie, mister?

49:44.748 --> 49:46.648
Wanna buy a tie, mister?

49:47.684 --> 49:50.676
Latest 5th Avenue creations.

49:50.787 --> 49:52.948
Buy a tie?

50:29.726 --> 50:34.823
#A small café, mam'selle #

50:34.931 --> 50:38.992
# Our rendezvous, mam'selle #

50:40.804 --> 50:42.999
#The violins #

50:43.106 --> 50:46.337
#Were warm and sweet #

50:46.443 --> 50:50.539
#And so were you, mam'selle #

50:51.581 --> 50:56.541
#And as the night danced by #

50:56.653 --> 51:02.057
#A kiss became a sigh #

51:02.159 --> 51:04.354
#Your lovely eyes #

51:04.461 --> 51:08.227
# Seemed to sparkle just like wine does #

51:08.331 --> 51:11.562
# No heart ever yearned #

51:11.668 --> 51:14.831
#The way that mine does #

51:14.938 --> 51:18.738
# For you #

51:18.842 --> 51:24.212
#And yet I know too well #

51:24.314 --> 51:29.877
#Someday you'll say good-bye #

51:29.986 --> 51:32.284
What are you buyin', mister?

51:32.389 --> 51:35.358
The name and address of the pickpocket
you sold to a girl tonight.

51:35.459 --> 51:39.020
Maybe I forgot.

51:40.397 --> 51:43.230
There's a hundred to remember.

51:43.333 --> 51:45.233
You pant like a dog.

51:47.404 --> 51:49.304
500.

51:49.406 --> 51:52.500
What's this guy made out of, diamonds?

51:52.609 --> 51:54.543
Just give me the answer.

51:57.147 --> 51:59.843
Maybe it'll come to me
in a couple of days.

52:01.017 --> 52:03.713
Maybe you won't be
around here in a couple of days.

52:07.991 --> 52:10.050
You threatenin' to blow my head off?

52:14.297 --> 52:18.233
Ask a silly question,
you get a dopey look.

52:18.335 --> 52:23.068
Why are you holding back on me?
You'd sell anybody for buttons.

52:23.173 --> 52:25.641
Yeah, but not to you, mister.

52:25.742 --> 52:29.234
Look, I haven't got a lot of time.

52:29.346 --> 52:32.509
You haven't got a lot of time?

52:35.685 --> 52:37.676
Listen, mister...

52:37.787 --> 52:40.017
when I come in here tonight...

52:40.123 --> 52:42.956
you seen an old clock runnin' down.

52:45.795 --> 52:47.695
I'm tired.

52:49.199 --> 52:51.099
I'm through.

52:52.335 --> 52:54.769
Happens to everybody sometime.

52:56.773 --> 52:59.173
It'll happen to you, too, someday.

53:01.378 --> 53:03.278
With me it's -

53:03.380 --> 53:05.371
it's a little bit of everything. I -

53:05.482 --> 53:07.575
Backaches and headaches.

53:09.619 --> 53:13.111
I can't sleep nights.

53:13.223 --> 53:16.317
It's so hard to get up
in the morning and...

53:16.426 --> 53:19.190
and get dressed and...

53:19.296 --> 53:21.924
walk the streets...

53:22.032 --> 53:24.023
climb the stairs.

53:25.468 --> 53:27.368
I go right on doing it.

53:29.639 --> 53:32.164
Well, what am I gonna do, knock it?

53:34.244 --> 53:38.544
- I have to go on makin' a living so I can die.
- # The violins were sweet #

53:38.648 --> 53:41.139
#And so were you #

53:41.251 --> 53:44.846
But even a fancy funeral ain't worth
waitin' for if I've gotta do business...

53:44.955 --> 53:47.788
with crumbs like you.

53:47.891 --> 53:50.758
And I know what you're after.

53:50.860 --> 53:52.760
What do you know?

53:52.862 --> 53:56.457
I know you Commies are looking
for some film that don't belong to you.

53:56.566 --> 54:01.833
# Your lovely eyes seemed to sparkle
just like wine does #

54:01.938 --> 54:05.237
You just talked yourself into an early grave.

54:05.342 --> 54:07.333
What else do you know?

54:07.444 --> 54:11.005
What do I know about Commies?
Nothin'.

54:12.115 --> 54:14.549
I know one thing.

54:14.651 --> 54:17.916
- I just don't like them.
- #And yet I know too well #

54:18.021 --> 54:23.687
#Someday you'll say good-bye #

54:23.793 --> 54:29.231
# Then violins will cry #

54:29.332 --> 54:33.428
- So I don't get to have the fancy funeral after all.
- #And so #

54:33.536 --> 54:36.403
# Will I #

54:36.506 --> 54:39.066
- Anyway, I tried.
- #Mam'selle ##

54:41.745 --> 54:44.145
Look, mister...

54:44.247 --> 54:46.875
I'm so tired...

54:46.983 --> 54:50.714
you'd be doin' me a big favor
if you'd blow my head off.

55:05.568 --> 55:08.093
- All right, on your feet. Come on.
- What is this, a stickup?

55:08.204 --> 55:11.935
- Put your hands up against that wall.
- Oh, cops. Sure.

55:12.042 --> 55:14.533
For a minute there I thought it was a stickup.

55:16.146 --> 55:20.014
- No weapon.
- Course not. I never used a gun in my life.

55:20.116 --> 55:22.016
- Turn around.
- Sure.

55:22.118 --> 55:25.053
- Hey, wait a minute. What is this?
- A homicide rap. Come on. Let's go.

55:25.155 --> 55:28.318
- Homicide? You got the wrong guy. Take it easy.
- Come on.

55:28.425 --> 55:30.893
You can't pull me in like this.
What's the charge?

55:30.994 --> 55:33.861
We're pullin' in every pickpocket
in Moe's book.

55:33.963 --> 55:35.954
When did you see her last?

55:36.066 --> 55:37.966
You mean Moe got it?

55:38.068 --> 55:40.263
- Somebody shot her head off.
- What?

55:40.370 --> 55:42.270
Lieutenant.

55:42.372 --> 55:44.897
Hey, Eddie.

55:46.042 --> 55:47.942
Yeah?

55:48.044 --> 55:49.944
Hang on to him.

56:01.791 --> 56:03.691
Yeah?

56:05.028 --> 56:07.519
- Lieutenant Campion?
- Yes?

56:07.630 --> 56:10.463
- My name is Enyart.
- Yes, sir.

56:10.567 --> 56:14.025
Your driver just told me what time it happened.
McCoy's not your man.

56:14.137 --> 56:16.435
I'm sorry, Mr. Enyart,
but my orders are to bring him in.

56:16.539 --> 56:18.871
I've been here the whole time,
Lieutenant, watching him.

56:18.975 --> 56:22.877
Have the captain of your homicide squad
check with Mr. Zara.

56:22.979 --> 56:24.970
All right. Come on.

56:26.316 --> 56:30.013
Yeah, I know, but I thought they were supposed
to hold on to her till somebody claims her.

56:30.120 --> 56:34.557
Nobody'll claim her.
She'll complete the morning load to potter's field.

56:34.657 --> 56:36.557
Oh.

56:36.659 --> 56:39.822
All right, Captain. Yeah.

56:39.929 --> 56:42.864
Yeah, I understand. Okay.

56:44.534 --> 56:46.434
- Hey, Eddie.
- Yeah.

56:46.536 --> 56:48.436
- Take 'em off.
- Huh?

56:48.538 --> 56:51.098
Take 'em off. Let's go.

56:54.177 --> 56:56.145
Well.

56:59.182 --> 57:04.245
- Somethin' wrong?
- I got a clearance to pick up number 11.

57:04.354 --> 57:07.949
The name's Moe. Moe Williams.

57:14.330 --> 57:17.424
Steve, 11 goes back.

57:18.501 --> 57:20.401
Give him a lift.

57:53.503 --> 57:56.131
- Relative?
- Nope.

57:56.239 --> 57:58.139
What are you gonna do with him?

57:58.241 --> 58:00.471
I'm gonna bury her.

59:05.875 --> 59:08.309
Moe's dead, Skip.

59:08.411 --> 59:10.311
She was shot in the head last night.

59:10.413 --> 59:12.643
It's in the papers.

59:12.749 --> 59:15.513
What are you doing here
without the dough?

59:16.619 --> 59:19.520
I went to her last night.

59:19.622 --> 59:22.455
I begged her not to tellJoey
where you lived.

59:23.560 --> 59:26.461
Sh-She wouldn't sell ya, Skip.

59:26.563 --> 59:29.555
- She really loved you.
- Who's Joey? Your old lady?

59:31.267 --> 59:33.792
- You're not listening.
- Is Joey your old lady?

59:33.903 --> 59:36.133
Yes.

59:36.239 --> 59:38.139
But I told her all about him.

59:38.241 --> 59:41.369
I knew he'd find her.

59:42.478 --> 59:45.140
- You think he did it?
- I'm sure of it.

59:46.616 --> 59:52.077
He was ordered to find you.
I was there. L-I saw him take the gun.

59:52.188 --> 59:55.783
But, honest, Skip,
I didn't think he'd kill her.

59:55.892 --> 59:57.792
Shut up.

59:57.894 --> 01:00:01.796
- It's my fault. I didn't know.
- I didn't mean it. I was thinking about Moe.

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:05.493
She just didn't figure to go that way.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.797
- It's all right. It's okay.
- It's my fault.

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:12.468
I've been up all night walking the streets.

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:15.203
I didn't know where to go.

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:18.144
When I read about it in the papers,
I had to see ya, Skip.

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:20.647
I had to tell ya how it happened.

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.116
You've been so wrong about me, Skip.

01:00:23.219 --> 01:00:26.017
- I had nothing to do with it
- It's all right.

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:31.093
I see the whole picture now.

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:35.055
Where does he live?

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:38.499
He's got a gun.

01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:41.570
I'll let the cops handle him.
Where does he live?

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:45.672
340 West 96th Street.

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:53.113
He better have that 25 grand ready.

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:18.934
- That's it.
- Skip!

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:24.010
Skip!

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:26.013
I'll be seein' ya.

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:32.048
Skip? Skip.

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:34.123
Oh.

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:55.776
Okay, lady.

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:03.450
- You the head of the pickpocket squad?
- Yep.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:06.750
There's the film you've been looking for-
the film the Commies want.

01:02:06.856 --> 01:02:08.756
Skip told me to bring it right to you.

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:10.758
- Skip told ya?
- Yeah.

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:13.852
Hey, I was followed here,
and not by friends.

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:17.421
I followed you.
This film is marked, all right.

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:19.467
Would you sit down over here, please?

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.965
Now, just relax and answer a few questions.

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:27.942
How did you contact Skip McCoy?

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:31.846
A lady called Moe.

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:34.917
- Your friends have anything
to do with her murder?
- Yes.

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:38.350
- Will you say that under oath?
- I'll tell you everything I know under oath.

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:41.252
Do you know what was on that film
when Skip lifted it from your purse?

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:45.186
Look, mister...

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:50.197
I didn't say anything about anybody
lifting anything from my purse.

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.733
I came here to help you out.
That's the way Skip wanted it.

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:56.669
He's been fightin' something inside him.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:03:00.470
Something decent trying to crawl out.

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:03.010
Well, what's the difference
why he sent me?

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:05.012
I'm here with the film.
That's enough.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:08.379
How long have you known
Joey was a Communist agent?

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:12.486
I didn't know till Skip told me.

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.858
Honest.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.259
You want to help us fight Communism,
don't you?

01:03:21.364 --> 01:03:23.730
That's why Skip sent me: To help you.

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:26.324
What I'm gonna ask you to do
might be dangerous.

01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:28.733
I'm here.

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:31.329
All right.

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.499
Go back toJoey with this film.

01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:35.975
Carry through with the original plan.

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:38.672
Whether you make delivery orJoey,
it doesn't matter.

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:41.875
We'll jump when this film passes
to the man we want.

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:45.987
Are you ready?

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.257
Sure.

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:51.485
PhoneJoey.
Tell him you've got the film.

01:03:55.598 --> 01:03:59.500
I told you there was a big difference
between a traitor and a pickpocket.

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.661
Hello. Joey?

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:03.966
This is Candy.

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:49.744
Candy? Candy!

01:04:49.852 --> 01:04:51.581
Joey?

01:04:51.687 --> 01:04:55.054
- Where are ya?
- I'm in the tub.

01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:57.216
That's why I left the door unlocked.

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.893
Pour yourself a cup of coffee.

01:05:00.997 --> 01:05:03.795
Come on out here.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.734
Did you hear me? I said come on out here.
Come on. Quit stalling.

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:11.974
Did you hear me?
I said come out.!

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:15.376
Candy.

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:30.225
Why did you give me a phony address?

01:05:30.326 --> 01:05:32.385
- I had to.
- Why?

01:05:32.495 --> 01:05:35.430
I didn't want you to kill him.
I didn't want you to go to the chair.

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:37.431
- Where you been all night?
- With him.

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:40.468
I'm gonna beat the truth out of you.
What are you up to?

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:44.130
Go ahead!
Beat up on me if you don't believe me.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.174
But I got the film.

01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:51.345
How'd you get it?

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:53.347
He wanted 25,000.
How did you do it?

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.713
How do you think?

01:05:56.852 --> 01:05:58.877
I wasn't lyin' to ya, Joey.

01:05:58.988 --> 01:06:02.082
L- I just didn't want to see you
get the chair.

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:06.490
You know how I feel about you.
I'd do anything for you, Joey.

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:08.961
- I'd give you anything I -
- There's a frame missing.

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:13.058
You'd do anything for me, huh?

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.772
Where does he live?

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:19.033
He's moved.

01:06:19.141 --> 01:06:22.076
- Where does he live?
- He's gone!

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:24.078
- Joey!
- Where does he live?

01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.341
I don't -

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.985
- Where does he live?
- I - Oh!

01:06:32.088 --> 01:06:34.784
- No!
- Where does he live?

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.790
Where does he live?

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:10.984
She's still alive.
Get an ambulance, quick.

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.924
Give me headquarters,
police headquarters.

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:19.756
He's in the building somewhere.
Try every floor, every stairway.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:24.662
Send an ambulance. A woman's been shot
at 607 West 74th Street, apartment 302.

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:26.734
And notify Homicide.

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:35.335
- He's not on the roof.
- Throw some more men at the entrance.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:37.877
Check the janitor closets on all floors.

01:08:45.888 --> 01:08:47.947
Gibbs. Gibbs.

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:50.719
Gibbs.

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:53.158
He's not down here.

01:08:53.261 --> 01:08:56.231
Well, he's in the building somewhere.
Check everything.

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.800
Check the dumbwaiter.

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:54.583
No, Gibbs didn't make it.
He died a few minutes ago.

01:09:55.824 --> 01:09:58.657
No. She's got a fifty-fifty chance.

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.991
Yes. General alarm is in effect right now.

01:10:01.096 --> 01:10:04.293
Every man in the police department's
cooperating with us.

01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:07.597
Yes, sir. Hundreds of prints
of his face have been distributed.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:14.275
I want you men
to keep reminding the officers...

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:18.676
that just as soon as Joey's recognized,
he's to be followed, no matter what happens.

01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:20.976
I want an arrest
when he passes that film.

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:24.246
Why are they taking so long?

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:26.548
Are you sure they went to get him?

01:10:26.655 --> 01:10:28.555
Why are they taking so long?

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:30.887
You'd better calm down
if you wanna get better.

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:33.393
Look, phone the cops.

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:35.793
Go look outside. See if he's coming.

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:37.798
Why are they taking so -

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.733
There's the door. Go answer it. Answer it!

01:10:57.052 --> 01:10:59.350
You all right?

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:13.424
Joey found a frame missing.

01:11:13.535 --> 01:11:15.435
I had to tell you
before he got to you.

01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:17.801
I play everything smart.

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:21.735
But you -

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:23.744
Clubbin' me and taking that film.

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:26.508
Look. Get rid of it, Skip.
Get rid of it.

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.515
You're clean now.

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:34.088
I'm sorry I spoiled your big score.

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:39.884
I know it sounds corny to you, but...

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:42.828
I'd rather have a live pickpocket
than a dead traitor.

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.295
And I'd rather have you talk
without a twist.

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:49.928
I told you before, Skip...

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:52.405
I wouldn't lie to you.

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:58.470
Does Joey know where I live?

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.715
Your address was in my purse.

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:05.514
That's why I wanted the cops
to get to you before he did.

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:07.680
Now, don't go back to the shack, Skip.

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:11.951
Did Joey kick your face in?

01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:15.927
Yeah.

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:17.999
Why?

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:26.868
'Cause I wouldn't tell him
where you live.

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:56.896
Not down here.

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:58.967
That's funny. The light's on.

01:13:59.067 --> 01:14:00.967
He'll probably be back in a minute.

01:14:01.069 --> 01:14:02.969
Why didn't you get in touch
with me earlier?

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:05.335
I couldn't take a chance
until they were off my back.

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:08.342
- You're sure this is the right place?
- Yes. This is it.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:12.403
Sixty- Sixty-six South Street.

01:14:12.514 --> 01:14:15.449
- How much time do we got?
- Thirty minutes.

01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:17.951
You better deliver what you've got.

01:14:20.355 --> 01:14:23.188
Maybe it might be better
if you turned it over.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.192
I'll wait here for McCoy.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.888
You haven't got much time.

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:35.902
- Joey.
- Yes?

01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:40.373
Tell him I'll meet him at the airport
with the other frame, but not to wait.

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:43.690
There's a frame missin', buster.

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:10.407
Hello, Tiger. How's the whip?

01:19:10.512 --> 01:19:12.571
Still crackin', huh?

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:16.674
You know, I didn't need an escort
from the clink back to this rattrap.

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:19.379
It's too bad you couldn't
make that charge stick, huh?

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:21.683
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:24.088
Let's have my release papers.

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.296
Thanks a lot.

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:37.437
Honey, you look as good as new.

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:39.530
Did you miss me, muffin?

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:43.077
Come on. Let's get out of here.

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:50.643
Well, ain't ya even gonna
say good-bye, Tiger?

01:19:50.752 --> 01:19:53.585
Wait a minute.

01:19:57.859 --> 01:19:59.759
I had you right where I wanted ya.

01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:02.455
A gun in your pocket -
a cinch for a three-time loser.

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.464
That's right.
What are you gonna do about it?

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:06.727
You'll always be a two-bit purse snatcher.

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:11.101
I give you 30 days before I pick you up
with your hand in somebody else's pocket.

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:14.841
You wanna bet?
