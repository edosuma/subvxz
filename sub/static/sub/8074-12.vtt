[music playing]

00:03.671 --> 00:06.907
[theme music]

00:08.842 --> 00:10.844
Hi, David.
Hi, Dinah.

00:10.878 --> 00:11.945
Hey.

00:11.979 --> 00:13.547
We're just bringing
my stuff up to DJ's room

00:13.581 --> 00:15.383
so Darlene can have the
basement when she gets home.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.951
Hey, Dinah, looks
like someone's

00:17.985 --> 00:18.786
in the kitchen with you.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.059
Well, yeah, you are.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.331
(SINGING) Strummin'
on the ol' banjo.

00:38.972 --> 00:41.075
Why couldn't Dinah
have married Mark?

00:41.109 --> 00:43.577
Then I wouldn't have to
know either one of them.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.513
You're the one that
pushed David to start dating

00:45.546 --> 00:46.547
again in the first place.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.316
You can't go slamming
his first attempt.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.717
I'm not going to slam her.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.219
I'm just going to
let Darlene sniff

00:51.252 --> 00:54.755
around at her for a while,
then I'll let go of the leash.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.023
Hey, hey.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.491
Don't you have
something to tell me?

00:57.525 --> 00:59.160
Oh, yeah, I love you, mom.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.061
No, not that.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.596
Your teacher, Mrs.
Holmes, called,

01:02.630 --> 01:04.832
and she wants to see me
and your dad at school.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.033
I really love you, mom.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.535
Bye!

01:07.568 --> 01:09.270
Why didn't you just tell
me she was going to call?

01:09.303 --> 01:11.639
I could have done that
no hablas ingles bit.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.277
Hey, you guys.

01:16.310 --> 01:19.046
Now I'm in the kitchen with you.

01:19.079 --> 01:23.517
I tried to explain it to her.

01:23.551 --> 01:24.685
Hold on, Roseanne.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.287
You're doing great.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.022
Hey, I'm home.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.924
Oh, Darlene, I can't
wait till you see

01:30.958 --> 01:32.960
what I got you for Christmas.

01:32.993 --> 01:38.031
In fact, it's kind of a
present for both of us.

01:38.065 --> 01:39.833
I love what you've
done with the place.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.269
It's a real pit.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.304
Well, now, darling, no
need to insult the house.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.138
We have a guest.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.409
Hey, David.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.743
Hey, Darlene.

01:49.777 --> 01:51.145
How's Jimmy?

01:51.179 --> 01:52.546
Good.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.448
Great, this is Dinah.

01:54.482 --> 01:58.051
Hey, uh, Darlene, Dinah
here's a cheerleader.

01:58.085 --> 01:59.887
What do you think of that, huh?

01:59.920 --> 02:00.721
Cool.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.759
Yeah, we have
to finish bringing

02:05.793 --> 02:09.230
my stuff up to DJ's room now.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.598
Well, Darlene, it
was nice meeting you.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.965
I'll see you later.

02:11.999 --> 02:12.800
DARLENE: Bye.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.805
You were so sweet.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.708
Who taught you to behave
that way to company?

02:20.741 --> 02:22.943
Well, Or would you
rather, I was meaner?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.878
Well, yeah, somebody has
to be, and I'm the mom,

02:24.912 --> 02:26.614
so it can't be me.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.115
Well, I'm glad
David's with her.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.883
I mean, it makes me not
have to feel guilty.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.619
I'm not going to be mean
to her just for your sake.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.622
Oh, you are one selfish
little girl, darlin'.

02:34.655 --> 02:38.025
[theme music]

03:19.967 --> 03:22.903
[laughs]

03:22.936 --> 03:26.340
[theme music]

03:27.941 --> 03:29.310
Hi.

03:29.343 --> 03:32.346
Uh, we're Roseanne
and Dan Conner.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.781
Thank you both for coming.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.350
I'm sorry to have to
pull you away from work.

03:36.384 --> 03:41.522
Hey, nothing's more important
to me than my son's education.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.992
So is DJ acting
up, Mrs. Teacher?

03:47.695 --> 03:49.730
Oh, DJ's behavior
is wonderful,

03:49.763 --> 03:51.164
but I'm afraid he's
not progressing

03:51.198 --> 03:54.067
as well as we'd hoped with
his homework assignments.

03:54.101 --> 03:57.605
Oh, well, Dan and I would
like to help him out more,

03:57.638 --> 04:02.476
but there are just so many
great things on TV these days.

04:02.510 --> 04:04.077
Every day I choose
one of the students

04:04.111 --> 04:06.079
to put his homework
answers on the board.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.382
And whenever I pick
DJ, he says he didn't

04:08.416 --> 04:10.618
understand the assignment.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.554
I think we should consider
the possibility that your son

04:13.587 --> 04:16.324
is, shall we say, special?

04:22.930 --> 04:28.802
Uh, do you mean special as
in the sporting goods store

04:28.836 --> 04:34.241
is having a special
on dumbbells?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.577
It's not what I
said, Mrs. Conner.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.011
I'm just saying
that your son might

04:38.045 --> 04:40.180
need a little more attention.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.282
Perhaps after the holidays,
we could try putting

04:42.316 --> 04:46.119
him in our Explorer class.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.220
Explorer, huh?

04:47.254 --> 04:48.456
What are they exploring?

04:48.489 --> 04:51.325
Coming in and out of the rain?

04:51.359 --> 04:53.126
I've seen this
sort of thing before.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.595
If we don't do
something soon, it

04:54.628 --> 04:58.065
could create serious
self-esteem problems for him.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.634
Gee, it sounds serious, Dan.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.536
Well, forget about it.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.404
He's just being lazy.

05:03.437 --> 05:04.938
Don't worry about it.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.374
From now on, he'll
be hitting the books

05:06.407 --> 05:09.276
or the books'll hitting him.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.177
Wrong, Dan.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.379
We're not going to punish him.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.280
We're going to support
him, and for a lot longer

05:13.313 --> 05:14.114
than we thought.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.424
Just so I know, am I
going to have any say

05:23.457 --> 05:25.192
in how we handle our kid?

05:25.225 --> 05:27.928
Oh, yeah, we'll split up
the tasks like we always do.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.564
I'll handle it, and you'll make
sure there's fresh batteries

05:30.598 --> 05:32.700
in the remote control.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.001
Perhaps you'd like
to discuss this--

05:34.034 --> 05:36.303
Oh, there's-- there's
nothing to discuss here.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.605
We always do things her way.

05:37.638 --> 05:41.308
Now, I knew there was no
reason for me to be here.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.843
I'm sorry about
this, Mrs. Conner.

05:42.876 --> 05:43.977
Don't worry about it.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.345
That's what you get when
you marry an explorer.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.389
ROSEANNE: No, she was serious.

05:55.423 --> 05:59.092
The teacher's totally
convinced that DJ is stupid.

05:59.126 --> 06:03.431
I guess she's never seen
his mashed potato castles.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.865
That's weird.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.266
How are you guys
going to handle it?

06:06.299 --> 06:08.969
Well, excuse me, I can see
I'm just in the way here.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.337
I'll just leave.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.339
Well, I'll make sure you
send a check every month.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.376
You ought to go
easy on him, Roseanne,

06:16.410 --> 06:18.145
because he was talking
to Fred down at work

06:18.178 --> 06:20.080
and I think he's
really pretty upset.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.214
About what?

06:21.248 --> 06:22.550
Evidently, the whole
thing that you guys went

06:22.583 --> 06:23.984
through with the
pregnancy and the way

06:24.017 --> 06:25.853
you boxed him out
of that decision

06:25.886 --> 06:27.254
made him feel like
he doesn't have

06:27.287 --> 06:29.122
an equal say with the kids.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.323
Well, that's stupid.

06:30.357 --> 06:31.992
They're not even the same thing.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.394
You know, when the kid's in my
body, I make all the decisions.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.864
But you know me, as soon as
I drop it out on the table,

06:36.897 --> 06:39.533
they're up for grabs.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.768
That's not true.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.871
Why not throw him a bone
and let him handle this one?

06:43.904 --> 06:46.373
Dan needs to know that
you have faith in him.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.575
Oh.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.977
All right, yeah,
he can handle it.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.145
He has a wonderful father.

06:52.179 --> 06:52.980
How did that sound?

06:55.683 --> 06:58.251
Dan!

06:58.285 --> 07:02.956
Hey, Dan, I was
thinking, uh, well,

07:02.990 --> 07:06.193
I think you should handle
this DJ and school thing.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.895
Oh, really?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.931
Well, that's not what
you said this afternoon.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.834
Well, a lot of stuff has
changed since this afternoon.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.203
Like, I realized he's not
my little boy anymore.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.805
He's getting to be a man.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.640
Except for that plastic
sheet on his bed.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.977
OK.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.345
I'll talk to him.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.481
Well, that's great because
I know you'll do a great job.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.782
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:28.816 --> 07:29.683
You mean it?

07:29.717 --> 07:30.751
Yeah.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.352
Hey, I've got an idea.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.322
Why don't you bounce off me
what you're going to say to DJ?

07:35.355 --> 07:36.657
You know.

07:36.690 --> 07:39.192
Uh, I'm sure it'll be fine
and everything, but you know,

07:39.226 --> 07:41.194
maybe this way I could
learn something, OK?

07:41.228 --> 07:42.563
OK, I'll be DJ.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.765
OK.

07:44.798 --> 07:50.270
Well, Deej, uh, being a
student is really important,

07:50.303 --> 07:51.605
because someday
soon you're going

07:51.639 --> 07:54.074
to be out in the real world.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.609
And you're going to
want to be smart enough

07:55.643 --> 07:57.210
to know when you're
getting hosed by your wife.

08:04.952 --> 08:05.819
Come on, Dan, I should--

08:05.853 --> 08:06.754
Don't interrupt me, son.

08:09.657 --> 08:10.991
Dan.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.860
And I think you're a little
young to be calling your father

08:12.893 --> 08:14.394
Dan.

08:14.427 --> 08:15.696
Ah, shut up.

08:15.729 --> 08:20.634
Ah-ha, I could still take
you over my knee, young man.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.869
He'll do fine.

08:21.902 --> 08:25.205
Yeah, I guess he
can't do DJ any harm.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.775
And if he does, well, there's
plenty more where he came from.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.380
Man, these Christmas
lights are pretty tangled.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.215
Dan, why don't you just
buy a new string this year?

08:35.248 --> 08:38.218
[grunts] Well, that'd be a
fairly large investment, Fred.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.692
She's damn right.

08:44.725 --> 08:45.893
You just take a
little time last year

08:45.926 --> 08:47.294
and put those things
away carefully

08:47.327 --> 08:48.629
when you took them down?

08:48.662 --> 08:51.431
Yeah, like that's how I want
to spend my Easter Sunday.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.406
Guys, let me ask you something.

08:59.439 --> 09:02.242
Did you ever have any
trouble in school?

09:02.275 --> 09:04.344
Yeah, you know,
every once in a while.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.746
How come?

09:05.779 --> 09:08.916
Well, DJ's slacking off and
his teacher thinks he's stupid.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.818
And I made this big
stink to Roseanne

09:10.851 --> 09:12.119
about how I could handle it.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.286
Yeah, so?

09:13.320 --> 09:15.455
[sighs] Now it's
like this big test,

09:15.488 --> 09:19.259
and if I blow it, she'll never
let me hear the end of it.

09:19.292 --> 09:23.731
Look, I talked to the kid
and I know what his problem is.

09:23.764 --> 09:29.036
Well, you know
what his problem is,

09:29.069 --> 09:31.104
I need to know what
his problem is.

09:31.138 --> 09:31.939
Impasse.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.444
What?

09:37.477 --> 09:39.680
Well, DJ told me that his
teacher makes them write

09:39.713 --> 09:41.615
their stuff on the
board and he can't

09:41.649 --> 09:44.084
stand up because he's, uh--

09:44.117 --> 09:46.186
he's embarrassed.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.956
You're losing me here, Mark.

09:48.989 --> 09:53.526
Well, he can't stand up,
because people will see.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.429
And you know, he's 13 now, and
sometimes things, you know--

09:59.166 --> 10:01.601
Oh, you mean, he's at that
age where on a sunny day,

10:01.635 --> 10:05.505
he could be laying on his back
and tell time without a watch.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.573
No, man.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.808
It's nothing to do
with telling the time.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.209
Man, the kid's
getting erections!

10:13.046 --> 10:14.915
So I told him just to
sit down and pretend

10:14.948 --> 10:16.216
he didn't know anything.

10:16.249 --> 10:18.551
And that way, he wouldn't
get called up to the board.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.519
Ah.

10:19.552 --> 10:20.420
Ah-ha.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.554
What a relief.

10:21.588 --> 10:24.257
Well, I can handle this.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.059
Here I was worried
about DJ being stupid.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.862
Turns out it's just you.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.698
Well, what was I supposed
to say to the kid, Dan?

10:30.731 --> 10:33.033
Well, it's not that
difficult a problem, Mark.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.002
We've all been there.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.236
We've all figured
out how to deal

10:36.269 --> 10:37.637
with this when we were his age.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.439
I always found that
nobody was any the wiser

10:39.472 --> 10:43.343
if I just kept my
shirt untucked.

10:43.376 --> 10:47.014
I occasionally employed
that device myself.

10:47.047 --> 10:50.317
Usually, however, I took
the more scholarly approach.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.987
I put a book in front of it.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.188
Yeah, a book was good.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.590
If you didn't have a book,
you just had to stick

10:57.624 --> 10:59.592
your hands in your pockets.

10:59.626 --> 11:00.794
That's usually
how mine started.

11:06.734 --> 11:08.335
But back at that
age, it didn't even

11:08.368 --> 11:09.703
have much to do with girls.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.272
Damn thing would pop up and
say "howdy do" for any reason.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.878
You know what usually set
me off was the vibrations

11:17.911 --> 11:19.947
on the school bus.

11:19.980 --> 11:24.184
All through junior high, I
dreamed of being a bus driver.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.319
That's the nice thing about
those coveralls at work,

11:26.353 --> 11:27.154
you know?

11:40.500 --> 11:41.835
I like that Dinah girl.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.570
She was nice.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.472
I broke up with her.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.506
Why

11:46.539 --> 11:48.776
I really don't want
to talk about it.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.310
Well, what was wrong with her?

11:50.343 --> 11:52.612
Is there some guy already
living in her parents' basement?

11:55.215 --> 11:57.818
She wasn't right for me, and
I'm not interested in dating

11:57.851 --> 11:59.386
just anybody.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.822
Oh, come on, David, you get
bucked off one cheerleader,

12:01.855 --> 12:06.493
you got to just climb
right back up on another.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.528
I think I've been spoiled.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.230
I mean, I know there are
other women out there

12:10.263 --> 12:11.364
that I could really
connect with,

12:11.398 --> 12:13.400
so I think I should
just hold out.

12:13.433 --> 12:17.570
Well, every relationship's
not going to be like you and me.

12:17.604 --> 12:20.974
I mean, you have to get over me.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.276
What makes you so sure
that I'm talking about you.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.412
Well, fine.
Then who are you talking about?

12:25.445 --> 12:26.313
Nobody.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.115
Just leave me alone.
- No.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.883
I mean, come on, if there's
another girl, great.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.118
Are you going to ask her out?

12:31.151 --> 12:32.119
No.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.186
Well, why not?

12:33.220 --> 12:35.022
Because she belonged
to somebody else,

12:35.055 --> 12:37.090
and I can't have her.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.826
You have to stop
torturing yourself.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.962
I mean, you've got to get over
me for the sake of both of us.

12:41.995 --> 12:42.863
Hey.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.231
What are guys doing?

12:44.264 --> 12:46.666
Oh, just a few seconds ago,
we blew this whistle that only

12:46.699 --> 12:47.600
dumb blondes can hear.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.872
Fine.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.773
Hey, we still up
for coffee later?

12:53.807 --> 12:55.208
- Yeah, is 8 o'clock OK?
- Sure.

12:55.242 --> 12:56.643
Oh, and I read that
book you gave me.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.045
I can't wait to talk
to you about it.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.047
[laughs] What book?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.983
"Horton Hears a Who!"?

13:03.016 --> 13:05.118
This is between me and David.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.760
[scoffs]

13:15.328 --> 13:16.363
You and Becky?

13:16.396 --> 13:18.866
Oh, man, I don't believe this.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.467
I don't care what you believe.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.434
Oh, but you should.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.070
I mean, your little
plan has worked.

13:23.103 --> 13:25.738
It's like now I feel like
I have to keep up with her.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.607
In fact, I'm going to get the
meat sucked out of my head

13:27.640 --> 13:31.111
and inject it into my breasts.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.046
You know, you don't
even know your sister.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.282
She's a much cooler
person than you realize.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.316
Oh, David, cut the act.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.217
I'm not buying it.

13:37.250 --> 13:38.118
This is not an act.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.320
I like spending time with Becky.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.654
And if you ever
gave her a chance,

13:41.688 --> 13:44.357
you'd learn she has some very
interesting things to say.

13:44.391 --> 13:45.658
Boy does she ever.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.595
Just yesterday she said to
me, (IMITATING FORREST GUMP)

13:48.628 --> 13:51.564
life is like a
box of chocolates.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.373
(SINGING TO "JINGLE BELLS"
TUNE) --through the house,

14:00.407 --> 14:01.641
looking for the beer.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.111
Opened up the icebox door.

14:04.144 --> 14:07.414
Oh my, there's one right here.

14:07.447 --> 14:08.916
What are you so happy about?

14:08.949 --> 14:09.816
Happy?

14:09.849 --> 14:10.717
Me?

14:10.750 --> 14:11.818
Never.

14:11.851 --> 14:12.785
Well, so?

14:12.819 --> 14:13.954
Did you talk to DJ?

14:13.987 --> 14:15.788
I mean, I know you
did, but did you?

14:15.822 --> 14:16.856
Yes.

14:16.890 --> 14:18.892
Suffice it to say,
your son is not stupid

14:18.926 --> 14:21.861
and the problem has
been solved by me.

14:21.895 --> 14:25.665
And that's all that I am
at liberty to divulge.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.733
You better tell me, Dan.

14:26.766 --> 14:30.537
Don't make me get
out the dental tools.

14:30.570 --> 14:34.674
It seems as though DJ was
getting, in class at least--

14:34.707 --> 14:37.310
well, probably other
times as well, I'm sure.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.679
But definitely in
class, DJ was getting--

14:39.712 --> 14:41.114
What?
Picked on?

14:41.148 --> 14:42.015
Pushed?

14:42.049 --> 14:43.583
Stabbed?

14:43.616 --> 14:45.185
DJ was getting erections.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.924
God, why couldn't
he just be stupid?

14:55.028 --> 14:57.697
Ah, it's no big deal.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.266
He's 13.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.802
It'll go away by the
time he's in his 30s.

15:02.835 --> 15:03.636
Trust me.

15:06.539 --> 15:10.043
Well, he better not be having
that problem around here.

15:10.077 --> 15:12.112
Well, of course not,
not with his mom around.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.246
You're the antidote.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.885
You think boys were
having that problem

15:18.918 --> 15:19.919
when we were in school?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.225
(IN DUMB VOICE)
Uh, no, Jackie,

15:25.258 --> 15:26.559
this must be a new problem.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.370
God, this is serious, Dan.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.706
He must be feeling really
scared and confused.

15:39.739 --> 15:40.707
What did you say to him?

15:40.740 --> 15:42.509
Uh, never fear.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.211
I just gave one of
the great secrets.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.578
It's been passed
down from father

15:45.612 --> 15:49.316
to son since the invention
of the printed word.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.918
I told him to put a
book in front of it.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.458
Well, that is great.

15:58.491 --> 16:01.161
[laughs] Isn't that
great, Roseanne?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.096
Oh, absolutely.

16:03.130 --> 16:06.533
It's about time he got some
use out of them school books.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.068
I take it you approve?

16:08.101 --> 16:10.303
Oh, yeah, I think
you did great.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.671
You're a great father, Dan.

16:11.704 --> 16:14.274
You are the mother
of all fathers.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.742
Thank you for everything.

16:15.775 --> 16:18.745
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
going to go read the paper

16:18.778 --> 16:21.514
and check "Dear
Abby" for errors.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.716
Way to go, big fella.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.119
Now, Roseanne, he tried.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.488
He did the best that he could.

16:28.521 --> 16:33.760
Well, his best
was very, very bad.

16:33.793 --> 16:37.164
You know, I'm sure this is a
big, emotional thing for DJ.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.733
What do you say to a
kid that has that problem?

16:40.767 --> 16:45.638
Well you look him in
the eye and nowhere else,

16:45.672 --> 16:49.809
and you tell him that
puberty's just a really

16:49.842 --> 16:50.943
rough time in their life.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.445
Their body's going
through a lot of changes,

16:52.479 --> 16:53.680
and they're not a freak.

16:53.713 --> 16:54.947
OK.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.483
Well, tell that to Dan and
let him talk to DJ again.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.684
No, I'm not
going to risk that.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.719
What if he screws up even worse?

16:59.752 --> 17:02.222
DJ'll wind up climbing
a tower with a big book

17:02.255 --> 17:03.056
in front of his rifle.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.965
Oh, there you are.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.401
Haven't seen you all day.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.368
Whatcha doing?

17:15.402 --> 17:17.036
Well, I'm watching
this Christmas

17:17.070 --> 17:18.271
movie with Jimmy Stewart.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.907
Hm-ha, yeah, they would
be better off without him.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.283
Wow.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.885
So--

17:32.919 --> 17:34.221
[opens mouth to speak]

17:36.223 --> 17:37.557
You're sure growing up.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.731
And that's great because
that is what kids do.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.934
They grow up.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.970
Nothing to be ashamed of.

17:51.003 --> 17:51.804
I know.

17:55.242 --> 18:01.581
You know, uh, when I was 13,
something really embarrassing

18:01.614 --> 18:02.849
happened to me, you know?

18:02.882 --> 18:05.017
I never thought I
would get over it.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.286
What?

18:06.319 --> 18:07.920
Well, [clears throat]
you know,

18:07.954 --> 18:11.624
the junior high had a
dance and your grandma

18:11.658 --> 18:13.760
had bought me this real
pretty white dress, you know?

18:13.793 --> 18:17.564
And in the middle of the dance,
I looked down at the dress

18:17.597 --> 18:23.403
and there was a, uh,
very noticeable stain.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.237
What was it?

18:27.006 --> 18:30.277
Well, DJ, it seems
that I was going

18:30.310 --> 18:34.214
through what all the girls were
going through at a certain age.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.882
I was having my first period.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.350
Oh, my god!

18:37.384 --> 18:39.819
I don't wanna hear it,
I don't wanna hear it!

18:39.852 --> 18:40.787
I don't wanna hear it.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.021
Whoa, what's goin' on?

18:42.054 --> 18:44.224
Mom told me a story I
don't want to hear anymore.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.259
Well, that's no reason
for you to go running out

18:46.293 --> 18:48.228
a room screaming like a maniac.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.062
It was about her
having her period!

18:50.096 --> 18:51.198
As you were.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.832
I don't wanna hear it,
I don't wanna hear it!

18:56.269 --> 18:59.105
What are you doing?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.773
I was just trying
to let him know

19:00.807 --> 19:02.642
he's not the only
13-year-old that

19:02.675 --> 19:03.843
had an embarrassing moment.

19:03.876 --> 19:04.744
Oh, no.

19:04.777 --> 19:09.015
Not the white dress story.

19:09.048 --> 19:11.884
I was trying to help
him with his problem.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.119
I helped him.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.854
Look, he's doing his homework.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.523
You made him feel ashamed.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.991
I don't want him to be
emotionally scarred.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.126
Well, you're right.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.494
It's just that I couldn't
think of anything

19:21.528 --> 19:23.963
that would send him screaming
from the room like you did.

19:27.734 --> 19:32.472
I just thought that you
might have screwed things up.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.907
You never did have
any faith in me.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.909
You lied to me.

19:36.943 --> 19:37.844
[sighs]

19:38.845 --> 19:40.079
All right, I lied to you.

19:40.112 --> 19:41.581
What do you want me
to do, say I'm sorry?

19:41.614 --> 19:43.716
OK, I'm sorry.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.452
I wanted you to
handle the DJ thing,

19:45.485 --> 19:48.521
so you would get over
feeling left out as a parent.

19:48.555 --> 19:53.059
I-- I did a horrible thing,
I lied, and I'm sorry.

19:53.092 --> 19:55.061
Oh, to hell with that.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.630
I want to hear you say
that your way was wrong

19:57.664 --> 19:59.165
and my way was right.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.433
Girl story, bad.

20:00.467 --> 20:03.135
Book, good.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.938
Yeah, well, whatever.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.807
No, no, no, no, no.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.975
No.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.142
Say it.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.078
OK.

20:12.111 --> 20:14.947
You did way better than
I thought you would have.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.149
Better than you.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.485
Better than most.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.787
Better than you.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.655
OK, you did better than me.

20:22.689 --> 20:25.124
Are you happy now?

20:25.157 --> 20:27.159
Why, if I were any
happier, I'd need a book.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.934
[theme music]

20:36.469 --> 20:37.337
Oh, come on now.

20:37.370 --> 20:38.538
Give us a break.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.040
It's just a normal, everyday
biological function.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.909
We have to call it something.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.444
I'm sorry, Roseanne.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.646
None of these expressions
are acceptable on network

20:46.679 --> 20:48.080
television.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.081
OK.

20:49.115 --> 20:52.652
Well, what about
pitching a trouser tent?

20:52.685 --> 20:55.422
No!

20:55.455 --> 20:58.658
Booting up the hard drive?

20:58.691 --> 21:00.927
No.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.463
Charming the anaconda?

21:03.496 --> 21:05.432
What the anaconda?

21:05.465 --> 21:06.399
Charming.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.233
No!

21:10.703 --> 21:13.840
Uh, raising the drawbridge.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.208
No.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.678
Popping a wheelie?

21:18.711 --> 21:20.647
No.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.749
Standing up for democracy.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.418
No!

21:25.452 --> 21:27.887
Waving to your chin.

21:27.920 --> 21:32.692
No, there's absolutely,
positively no way any of these

21:32.725 --> 21:34.827
are going to get on the air.

21:34.861 --> 21:35.662
Too late.

21:39.766 --> 21:42.935
Is that on?

21:42.969 --> 21:46.238
Ah, [bleep].

21:46.272 --> 21:49.509
[theme music]
