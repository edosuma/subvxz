(BOTH PANTING)

00:07.083 --> 00:08.876
I am sick of having

00:08.877 --> 00:10.667
to take the stairs

00:07.083 --> 00:10.667
just so you can avoid Tony!

00:10.959 --> 00:12.667
Yeah. Things

00:12.668 --> 00:14.375
have been supes awkward

00:10.959 --> 00:14.375
since you guys broke up.

00:14.751 --> 00:16.001
But on the bright side,

00:16.001 --> 00:17.250
my legs look fabulous.

00:17.292 --> 00:19.000
(PANTING)

00:19.042 --> 00:20.542
Things are not awkward

00:20.543 --> 00:22.042
between Tony and me.

00:22.083 --> 00:23.563
Then why did we have to

00:23.564 --> 00:25.042
take the fire escape

00:22.083 --> 00:25.042
up here yesterday?

00:25.083 --> 00:26.542
Well, sue me for trying

00:26.543 --> 00:28.000
to teach you some emergency

00:25.083 --> 00:28.000
fire preparedness.

00:29.417 --> 00:31.334
Um, if there's a fire,

00:31.375 --> 00:32.522
why would we climb back

00:32.523 --> 00:33.667
into the penthouse?

00:33.709 --> 00:35.647
Maybe the sidewalk is on fire.

00:35.648 --> 00:37.584
You ever think of that,

00:33.709 --> 00:37.584
smart guy?

00:38.792 --> 00:40.417
Wonderful news, everyone.

00:40.459 --> 00:42.022
I just procured an internship

00:42.023 --> 00:43.584
at the Central Park zoo!

00:43.876 --> 00:45.000
Ravi, that's great!

00:45.292 --> 00:46.918
How much do you get paid?

00:46.959 --> 00:48.439
It is an internship.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.918
I get paid in

00:46.959 --> 00:49.918
the currency of knowledge.

00:51.334 --> 00:53.438
Well, maybe it'll

00:53.439 --> 00:55.542
give you the knowledge

00:51.334 --> 00:55.542
to ask for money next time.

Hey, look, Tony,

02:37.440 --> 02:39.042
why does it have to be

02:35.834 --> 02:39.042
so weird between us?

02:39.083 --> 02:41.042
- Just because you've seen
- me without makeup

02:41.083 --> 02:43.042
- And I've seen you
- without hair gel...

02:43.083 --> 02:44.959
- I bet he looked better
- than you did.

02:46.167 --> 02:47.459
Who said that?

02:49.083 --> 02:50.876
You know, Jessie,

02:50.877 --> 02:52.667
it hasn't been that long

02:49.083 --> 02:52.667
since we broke up.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.459
It's natural for things

02:55.460 --> 02:57.834
to be a little weird, until,

02:53.083 --> 02:57.834
you know, you move on.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.376
(SCOFFS) Oh, oh,

02:59.377 --> 03:00.667
I've... I've moved on.

03:00.709 --> 03:02.749
- Yeah, I've probably
- moved further than you have.

03:02.876 --> 03:04.101
- How do you know
- how far I've moved?

03:04.125 --> 03:05.250
Maybe I've moved plenty.

03:05.834 --> 03:07.272
Can we move to the park?

03:07.273 --> 03:08.709
I'm getting bored.

03:09.792 --> 03:11.418
Look, Tony, if you want

03:11.419 --> 03:13.042
to date someone else,

03:09.792 --> 03:13.042
I'd be cool with it.

03:13.083 --> 03:15.044
- And I'm cool if you
- want to date someone else.

03:15.083 --> 03:16.542
You know

03:16.543 --> 03:18.000
what would be super cool?

03:15.083 --> 03:18.000
Going to the park.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.500
So, if you're ready to date

03:21.501 --> 03:23.000
and I'm ready to date,

03:23.500 --> 03:25.185
- then we should set
- each other up on dates.

03:25.209 --> 03:26.376
Tomorrow night.

03:26.377 --> 03:27.542
BOTH: We should?

03:27.584 --> 03:29.083
They should?

03:29.584 --> 03:30.918
Yeah. And you know what?

03:31.083 --> 03:32.876
- I have got - the perfect girl
- For you.

03:33.083 --> 03:34.918
She's beautiful,

03:34.919 --> 03:36.751
smart, fun. Red hair.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.542
I'm gonna set it up.

03:39.083 --> 03:40.292
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

03:40.293 --> 03:41.500
What about the park?

03:42.083 --> 03:43.083
Can you believe that?

03:44.083 --> 03:45.751
She's throwing herself at me!

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Say what now?

03:47.959 --> 03:49.709
Jessie just described herself.

03:49.959 --> 03:52.185
- So I don't need to find
- her a date for tomorrow night

03:52.209 --> 03:53.522
Because, obviously,

03:53.523 --> 03:54.834
she wants to date me!

03:55.083 --> 03:56.105
Why would she

03:56.106 --> 03:57.125
set herself up with you?

03:57.167 --> 03:58.584
You broke up.

03:58.585 --> 04:00.000
Been there, dated that.

04:01.167 --> 04:02.314
Clearly she's

04:02.315 --> 04:03.459
still hung up on me.

04:03.709 --> 04:04.772
Oh, that poor,

04:04.773 --> 04:05.834
heartbroken little girl.

04:06.167 --> 04:07.980
You know what they say.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.792
"Once you leave Tony,

04:06.167 --> 04:09.792
you feel so alone-y."

04:10.083 --> 04:11.083
Mmm... Nobody says that.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.083
- I can't believe
- Jessie is still into Tony.

04:17.875 --> 04:18.959
(SCOFFS)

04:18.961 --> 04:20.041
Wait till he goes bald.

04:20.083 --> 04:22.000
- They all leave
- when the hair leaves.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.584
Great, Valerie. You are gonna

04:25.585 --> 04:27.042
have so much fun on your date

04:24.125 --> 04:27.042
with Tony.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.584
He has awesome hair.

04:28.626 --> 04:30.000
(SCOFFS) For now...

04:31.125 --> 04:32.418
And I can't wait to see

04:32.419 --> 04:33.709
who Tony sets me up with.

04:34.083 --> 04:36.042
- It's gonna be fun.
- Okay, bye!

04:36.083 --> 04:37.209
(CHUCKLING)

04:40.042 --> 04:41.500
What are you laughing at?

04:42.083 --> 04:44.042
- Okay, as funny
- as this would be,

04:44.083 --> 04:45.667
- There's something
- I should tell you.

04:45.918 --> 04:47.376
See, you're setting

04:47.377 --> 04:48.834
Tony up with a real girl...

04:48.876 --> 04:49.960
Right. And it says a lot

04:49.961 --> 04:51.042
about your social life

04:51.083 --> 04:53.203
- that you feel the need
- to make that clarification.

04:54.709 --> 04:56.584
But you were saying...

04:57.000 --> 04:58.855
Oh, never mind.

04:58.856 --> 05:00.709
Have fun on your

04:57.000 --> 05:00.709
"mystery" date!

05:01.250 --> 05:02.751
(CHUCKLING)

05:02.792 --> 05:04.059
- Okay. I... I still - don't understand
- Why you're laughing.

05:04.083 --> 05:06.042
- Oh, I just love life.
- (LAUGHS)

05:06.083 --> 05:07.083
Since when?

05:11.626 --> 05:12.834
I am so excited

05:12.835 --> 05:14.042
to work with the animals.

05:14.083 --> 05:15.563
And, of course,

05:15.564 --> 05:17.042
help you with

05:14.083 --> 05:17.042
your grueling workload.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.959
- Oh, I don't need help
- with my load.

05:19.876 --> 05:21.042
Just the animals' loads.

05:22.792 --> 05:23.918
So I will only

05:23.919 --> 05:25.042
be working

05:22.792 --> 05:25.042
with this shovel?

05:25.083 --> 05:26.397
Of course not.

05:26.398 --> 05:27.709
When you get

05:25.083 --> 05:27.709
to the elephant cage,

05:27.751 --> 05:29.831
- (ELEPHANT TRUMPETING)
- You're gonna need this one.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.584
Well, it is a good thing

05:33.585 --> 05:35.042
I did that push-up last week.

05:38.083 --> 05:40.125
So, do you enjoy working here?

05:40.167 --> 05:41.501
Oh, yes.

05:41.502 --> 05:42.834
Animals are my life.

05:43.167 --> 05:44.667
I work with them all day,

05:44.709 --> 05:46.188
and then at night

05:46.189 --> 05:47.667
I sleep right

05:44.709 --> 05:47.667
outside their habitats.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.334
So they don't get lonely.

05:49.375 --> 05:50.688
There are many animals

05:50.689 --> 05:52.000
in each habitat.

05:52.083 --> 05:53.167
They have each other.

05:53.209 --> 05:54.251
All right,

05:54.252 --> 05:55.292
so I don't get lonely.

05:58.834 --> 05:59.939
New York City

05:59.940 --> 06:01.042
is filled with people.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.083
Do you not want

06:02.084 --> 06:03.083
to go out and meet

06:01.083 --> 06:03.083
some of them?

06:03.125 --> 06:04.584
Oh, no.

06:04.585 --> 06:06.042
It's a jungle out there.

06:03.125 --> 06:06.042
And not the good kind.

06:07.083 --> 06:08.647
Truth is...

06:08.648 --> 06:10.209
I'm afraid of people.

06:11.083 --> 06:12.250
You are not afraid of me.

06:12.834 --> 06:13.918
I know. Because you

06:13.919 --> 06:15.000
remind me of a ferret.

06:18.125 --> 06:20.063
Oh, Roy.

06:20.064 --> 06:22.000
Do you want

06:18.125 --> 06:22.000
your num-nums?

06:22.209 --> 06:24.125
- (GROWLING)
- I have to go get his bananas.

06:24.167 --> 06:26.000
- He likes them
- cut into little shapes.

06:26.167 --> 06:27.417
What kind of shapes?

06:27.418 --> 06:28.667
Tiny people.

06:30.292 --> 06:31.626
As a tiny person,

06:31.627 --> 06:32.959
should I be worried?

06:34.959 --> 06:36.064
Oh, no.

06:36.065 --> 06:37.167
Just don't wear yellow.

06:37.209 --> 06:38.251
That is the color

06:38.252 --> 06:39.292
of my uniform!

06:39.751 --> 06:41.376
Yes. Which explains

06:41.377 --> 06:43.000
our constant need

06:39.751 --> 06:43.000
for new interns...

06:45.918 --> 06:47.376
Hi, Ravi. Jessie sent me

06:47.377 --> 06:48.834
down because you

06:45.918 --> 06:48.834
forgot your lunch.

06:49.083 --> 06:51.042
- Are you having fun
- with the animals?

06:51.083 --> 06:52.209
- (ROARS)
- Oh!

06:55.042 --> 06:57.376
Alas, no. Ms. Kruchall

06:57.377 --> 06:59.709
gets to do all the fun stuff

06:55.042 --> 06:59.709
with the animals.

06:59.751 --> 07:01.185
- What about
- when she goes on break?

07:01.209 --> 07:03.042
She never leaves the zoo.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.438
Well, obviously we need

07:04.439 --> 07:05.792
to get Ms. Kruchall

07:03.083 --> 07:05.792
a social life.

07:06.083 --> 07:07.375
That will not be easy.

07:07.876 --> 07:09.063
She's afraid of people,

07:09.064 --> 07:10.250
she scratches a lot,

07:10.918 --> 07:12.501
and earlier today

07:12.502 --> 07:14.083
she asked me to pick nits

07:10.918 --> 07:14.083
out of her hair.

07:15.209 --> 07:17.042
- Ravi, I need
- your help again.

07:17.083 --> 07:18.292
This one is a whopper.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.042
Hi! I'm Emma.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.000
Aah! Person! Blend in!

07:28.125 --> 07:30.167
Uh... I can still see you.

07:33.209 --> 07:34.688
Ms. Kruchall,

07:34.689 --> 07:36.167
this is just

07:33.209 --> 07:36.167
my sister, Emma.

07:36.459 --> 07:37.668
Emma, hold out

07:37.669 --> 07:38.876
your hand

07:36.459 --> 07:38.876
so she can sniff it.

07:44.459 --> 07:46.042
- (SNIFFS)
- Nice to meet you.

07:48.083 --> 07:49.334
You, too.

07:49.375 --> 07:50.688
So, Ravi tells me

07:50.689 --> 07:52.000
you're married to your work.

07:52.167 --> 07:53.667
Wouldn't you

07:53.668 --> 07:55.167
rather be married to,

07:52.167 --> 07:55.167
you know, a guy?

07:56.083 --> 07:58.042
- Sure.
- If it were Dr. Durst.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.001
He's in charge of the turtles,

08:00.002 --> 08:01.918
but he's painfully shy.

08:02.167 --> 08:03.292
This coming from a woman

08:03.293 --> 08:04.417
who just hid behind a bunch

08:02.167 --> 08:04.417
of bananas!

08:06.083 --> 08:08.147
Well, maybe Emma could help

08:08.148 --> 08:10.209
you get him out of his shell.

08:06.083 --> 08:10.209

08:16.209 --> 08:17.772
Do you really think

08:17.773 --> 08:19.334
you could make

08:16.209 --> 08:19.334
Dr. Durst notice me?

08:19.375 --> 08:20.709
Absolutely!

08:20.751 --> 08:21.897
We just need

08:21.898 --> 08:23.042
to take a quick trip

08:20.751 --> 08:23.042
to the salon.

08:23.083 --> 08:25.000
- And by "quick trip,"
- I mean the entire day.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.918
(STUTTERS) Oh, I can't leave.

08:27.919 --> 08:29.459
Uh, there's no one

08:26.375 --> 08:29.459
to watch the animals.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.500
I, your trusty intern, will.

08:31.542 --> 08:33.250
- I will watch
- them like a hawk.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.897
Except for the meerkats,

08:34.898 --> 08:36.292
because that would

08:33.500 --> 08:36.292
just freak them out.

08:37.876 --> 08:39.147
All right, Ravi,

08:39.148 --> 08:40.417
you're in charge

08:37.876 --> 08:40.417
for the next few hours.

08:40.458 --> 08:41.792
But remember,

08:41.793 --> 08:43.125
no letting your friends

08:40.458 --> 08:43.125
in for free.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.022
No problem!

08:45.023 --> 08:46.042
I have no friends!

08:46.083 --> 08:47.188
Now, please leave

08:47.189 --> 08:48.292
before I start crying.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.167
Now I can

08:54.168 --> 08:55.250
spend some time

08:53.083 --> 08:55.250
with the animals.

08:55.292 --> 08:56.376
Who is ready

08:56.377 --> 08:57.459
to have some fun?

08:58.375 --> 09:00.042
Count me in.

09:00.083 --> 09:01.188
Luke,

09:01.189 --> 09:02.292
what are you doing here?

09:02.626 --> 09:04.438
This party animal

09:04.439 --> 09:06.250
wants to party

09:02.626 --> 09:06.250
with some animals.

09:07.209 --> 09:08.772
What should I do first,

09:08.773 --> 09:10.334
buffalo polo,

09:07.209 --> 09:10.334
or giraffe jousting?

09:11.584 --> 09:13.042
Neither!

09:13.083 --> 09:14.393
- Ms. Kruchall
- left me in charge,

09:14.417 --> 09:16.209
- And I do not want
- to lose her trust.

09:16.500 --> 09:17.772
There is no room

09:17.773 --> 09:19.042

- when the monkeys do it.

- It is precisely
- their business.

09:32.584 --> 09:34.252
Hey, Tony!

09:34.253 --> 09:35.918
So, is my date ready to go?

09:36.083 --> 09:38.042
- I think so.
- She's been waiting for you

09:38.083 --> 09:40.059
- In that horse-drawn - carriage for, like,
- 10 minutes.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.250
(HORSE NICKERING)

09:41.584 --> 09:43.334
Wait. You got me

09:43.335 --> 09:45.083

09:45.125 --> 09:46.168
Yeah. Why is everyone

09:46.169 --> 09:47.209
so hung up on that?

09:47.250 --> 09:48.439
Uh... No, it's just...

09:48.440 --> 09:49.626
I'm shocked.

09:49.667 --> 09:51.355
Because she

09:51.356 --> 09:53.042
is the most beautiful girl

09:49.667 --> 09:53.042
I've ever seen!

09:55.042 --> 09:56.063
I mean, when

09:56.064 --> 09:57.083
I'm not looking at you.

09:58.250 --> 09:59.313
Which I'm not,

09:59.314 --> 10:00.375
because she's gorgeous!

- Yeah, yeah.
- Where's my date?

10:06.292 --> 10:09.167
date's in the lobby.

- I'll go see!

15:56.500 --> 15:58.250
(GROWLING)

16:06.834 --> 16:08.167
You know,

16:08.168 --> 16:09.500
eating discarded food

16:06.834 --> 16:09.500
is unsafe,

16:09.542 --> 16:10.876
unhealthy, and about

16:10.877 --> 16:12.209
as romantic as a snart.

16:13.083 --> 16:14.772
Oh, you want romance?

16:14.773 --> 16:16.459
You got it.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.980
Here, grab the other end.

16:17.981 --> 16:19.250
Let's Lady and

16:16.709 --> 16:19.250
the Tramp this thing.

16:21.834 --> 16:23.313
Eddie Earl, have you ever

16:23.314 --> 16:24.792
heard the expression

16:21.834 --> 16:24.792
"You are what you eat"?

16:24.834 --> 16:26.334
- Well, you eat trash.
- Just sayin'.

16:27.209 --> 16:28.584
Oh. Well,

16:28.585 --> 16:29.959
I suppose you'd rather

16:27.209 --> 16:29.959
be the person

16:30.000 --> 16:31.188
going to a restaurant,

16:31.189 --> 16:32.375
eating only half an eclair,

16:32.417 --> 16:34.226
- and then wastefully
- throwing the rest away.

16:34.250 --> 16:35.293
"A," is that option back

16:35.294 --> 16:36.334
on the table?

16:36.751 --> 16:37.959
And "B,"

16:37.960 --> 16:39.167
I finish my eclairs.

16:39.876 --> 16:41.543
You know what?

16:41.544 --> 16:43.209
This argument is leaving

16:39.876 --> 16:43.209
a bad taste in my mouth.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.709
You sure it's not

16:44.710 --> 16:46.167
all the garbage you

16:43.250 --> 16:46.167
shoveled in there?

16:47.751 --> 16:49.251
Tony! How could you set me

16:49.252 --> 16:50.751
up with a guy who eats trash?

16:51.334 --> 16:53.459
- To be fair,
- I didn't know Earl did that.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.894
- I thought his name
- was Eddie Earl.

16:54.918 --> 16:56.084
To be even more fair,

16:56.085 --> 16:57.250
I didn't know his name.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.126
Wait. (STUTTERS)

16:59.127 --> 17:00.500
You mean...

16:57.751 --> 17:00.500
So you barely knew him?

17:01.083 --> 17:02.250
How could you do this to me?

17:02.292 --> 17:03.959
- I set you up
- with a great girl

17:04.000 --> 17:05.626
- Who eats new,
- purchased food!

17:06.666 --> 17:08.042
If she's so great,

17:08.044 --> 17:09.416
then why did Valerie walk out

17:06.666 --> 17:09.416
on our date, huh?

17:09.917 --> 17:11.480
You said she got paged

17:11.481 --> 17:13.041
to the hospital

17:09.917 --> 17:13.041
for an emergency.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.876
- Oh, yeah.
- That's right.

17:15.459 --> 17:16.834
- She's a doctor,
- you know.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.146
I know!

17:19.147 --> 17:20.291
Because I know her!

17:22.375 --> 17:23.709
Guess who found a perfectly

17:23.710 --> 17:25.041
good mint sitting on a table?

17:25.083 --> 17:26.751
(CHUCKLES)

17:27.083 --> 17:28.647
Oh, wait. I think

17:28.648 --> 17:30.209
it's actually a button.

17:31.459 --> 17:32.626
What are you, a goat?

17:32.627 --> 17:33.792
Ugh!

17:33.834 --> 17:35.292
- Could this date
- get any worse?

17:35.834 --> 17:37.626
(SCREAMING)

17:37.667 --> 17:38.834
Quick! Into the bins!

17:38.876 --> 17:40.209
(ZURI YELLING)

17:41.417 --> 17:43.059
- ZURI: Get in.
- JESSIE: Oh! Soggy taquitos.

17:43.083 --> 17:44.667
- Dibs!
- (GORILLA GROWLING)

17:45.584 --> 17:47.417
(ALL SCREAMING)

17:50.459 --> 17:52.000
- You look great,
- Ms. Kruchall.

17:52.459 --> 17:54.000
- (GASPS)
- Ooh, here comes Dr. Durst!

17:54.500 --> 17:55.772
Remember do not

17:55.773 --> 17:57.042
sniff his hand.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.644
- Unless things
- are going really well.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.542
(SCREAMS)

18:04.375 --> 18:06.000
- Well, that
- could've gone better.

18:22.542 --> 18:23.647
Ravi, what is Roy

18:23.648 --> 18:24.751
doing out of his cage?

18:24.792 --> 18:26.375
Whoa!

18:26.417 --> 18:27.709
Uh, at the moment,

18:27.710 --> 18:29.000
he is climbing

18:26.417 --> 18:29.000
the Empire Skate Building!

18:29.751 --> 18:31.334
How ironic.

18:31.375 --> 18:33.375
(GASPS)

18:33.417 --> 18:34.959
(SCREAMING)

18:35.083 --> 18:36.292
Roy!

18:37.792 --> 18:39.334
Good boy.

18:39.584 --> 18:41.000
- You wanna
- go back in your cage?

18:43.083 --> 18:44.834
- I don't think
- he recognizes me!

18:45.083 --> 18:46.709
Thanks a lot, Emma,

18:46.751 --> 18:48.063
for making me look

18:48.064 --> 18:49.375
10 times more beautiful

18:46.751 --> 18:49.375
than I usually do.

18:50.083 --> 18:52.000
- Ten times?
- (SCOFFS)

18:55.083 --> 18:57.000
(ROARING)

18:59.083 --> 19:00.563
Thanks a lot, Tony.

19:00.564 --> 19:02.042
This is my worst date ever!

19:02.083 --> 19:03.375
And that's saying a lot.

19:04.542 --> 19:05.710
Well, someone can

19:05.711 --> 19:06.876
just forget about

19:04.542 --> 19:06.876
a second date.

19:08.876 --> 19:09.960
Jessie...

19:09.961 --> 19:11.042
See, the thing is,

19:11.083 --> 19:12.230
the way you

19:12.231 --> 19:13.375
described my date...

19:13.417 --> 19:15.709
Beautiful, smart, red hair,

19:15.710 --> 19:18.000
the "perfect girl" for me...

19:19.542 --> 19:20.710
I thought it was you.

19:20.711 --> 19:21.876
Oh, Tony.

19:22.459 --> 19:24.042
You're not over me.

19:24.918 --> 19:26.314
That's so sweet.

19:26.315 --> 19:27.709
But I'm not surprised.

19:27.751 --> 19:29.397
You know what they say.

19:29.398 --> 19:31.042
"Once you leave Jessie,

19:27.751 --> 19:31.042
your heart's all depress-y."

19:32.709 --> 19:34.042
Seriously!

19:34.043 --> 19:35.375
Nobody says these things!

19:37.709 --> 19:39.251
I do not see Roy.

19:39.252 --> 19:40.792
Maybe he left.

19:41.042 --> 19:42.959
- (GROWLING)
- Maybe not!

19:43.083 --> 19:45.250
(ALL SCREAMING)

19:48.083 --> 19:49.834
Why couldn't you two nitwits

19:49.876 --> 19:51.956
- have left open the door
- to the butterfly habitat?

19:52.542 --> 19:54.584
Hey, Roy! Over here!

19:54.626 --> 19:56.459
(GROWLING)

19:56.500 --> 19:58.272
Ravi, no! If you throw

19:58.273 --> 20:00.042
that pie in his face,

19:56.500 --> 20:00.042
it'll only make him angrier!

20:00.083 --> 20:01.313
Plus, my date'll make me

20:01.314 --> 20:02.542
eat whatever's left!

20:04.083 --> 20:06.500
It is banana cream pie.

20:06.542 --> 20:07.647
I will appeal

20:07.648 --> 20:08.751
to his simian palate

20:08.792 --> 20:09.938
to lure him into

20:09.939 --> 20:11.083
the refuse receptacle.

20:11.125 --> 20:13.086
- I can never understand
- what that kid's saying!

20:16.918 --> 20:18.501
Yum, yum, yum!

20:18.502 --> 20:20.083
It is delicious

20:16.918 --> 20:20.083
and full of potassium.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.459
(GASPS)

20:28.626 --> 20:30.459
- Oh! Ravi,
- that was amazing.

20:31.125 --> 20:32.459
Is everyone okay?

20:33.083 --> 20:34.334
Where's Earl?

20:34.375 --> 20:36.059
- EARL: (ECHOING) - Hey, gorilla!
- That's my taquito!

20:36.083 --> 20:38.000
(EARL SCREAMING)

20:39.626 --> 20:40.834
(LAUGH) Stop! Stop it!

20:40.835 --> 20:42.042
That tickles.

20:42.083 --> 20:43.959
Aah! Okay, okay.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.834
We'll split the taquito.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.000
(MS. KRUCHALL PANTING)

20:50.083 --> 20:52.000
- Here. - Sit down, sit down.
- It's okay.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.042
What happened?

20:54.083 --> 20:56.042
- Ravi trapped - the gorilla inside
- That bin.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.083
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.418
Ravi,

20:59.419 --> 21:00.751
your poop-shoveling

20:58.083 --> 21:00.751
days are over.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.042
- You mean
- I'm getting a promotion?

21:03.083 --> 21:04.542
No, I mean you

21:04.543 --> 21:06.000
let a gorilla escape.

21:03.083 --> 21:06.000
You're fired.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.083
Oh. That is

21:08.084 --> 21:09.084
a stone-cold bummer.

21:10.751 --> 21:12.000
Wait a minute!

21:12.584 --> 21:14.143
- If it weren't
- for Ravi's quick thinking,

21:14.167 --> 21:15.727
- That gorilla would
- have killed all of us,

21:15.751 --> 21:18.231
- And dragged Emma - to the top of the
- Empire Skate Building!

21:19.125 --> 21:21.209
Yeah. It isn't Ravi's fault.

21:21.250 --> 21:22.605
This never would

21:22.606 --> 21:23.959
have happened if I didn't want

21:21.250 --> 21:23.959
to hang with the hippos.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.083
Long story.

21:26.751 --> 21:27.835
Okay, we'll talk

21:27.836 --> 21:28.918
about that later.

21:29.083 --> 21:30.876
Look, this job

21:30.877 --> 21:32.667
is incredibly important

21:29.083 --> 21:32.667
to Ravi.

21:32.709 --> 21:33.834
Nobody loves animals

21:33.835 --> 21:34.959
more than him.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.876
- He's in couples therapy
- with his lizard.

21:37.667 --> 21:38.939
Mrs. Kipling hears,

21:38.940 --> 21:40.209
but she does not listen!

21:43.083 --> 21:44.813
Well, we animal lovers

21:44.814 --> 21:46.542
should stick together.

21:47.083 --> 21:48.083
And you did save

21:48.084 --> 21:49.084
hundreds of lives,

21:49.125 --> 21:50.792
- even if they
- were just people.

21:52.083 --> 21:53.188
So you're

21:53.189 --> 21:54.292
officially re-hired.

21:54.334 --> 21:55.584
(GASPS)

21:55.626 --> 21:57.546
- And I really - am taking you
- Off doodie duty.

21:59.083 --> 22:00.876
She said "doodie duty."

22:02.083 --> 22:04.000
I am back in!

22:04.042 --> 22:05.542
Right after you clean up

22:05.543 --> 22:07.042
all the piles Roy

22:04.042 --> 22:07.042
left in the park.

22:07.083 --> 22:08.542
Bu... Uh, to be fair,

22:08.543 --> 22:10.000
I feel like some of those

22:07.083 --> 22:10.000
were left by people.

22:10.083 --> 22:12.000
- It got pretty scary
- around here.

22:16.083 --> 22:17.563
Oh, hey, Tony.

22:17.564 --> 22:19.042
Thanks again

22:16.083 --> 22:19.042
for the great date.

22:19.083 --> 22:20.147
Maybe next time

22:20.148 --> 22:21.209
you can set me up

22:19.083 --> 22:21.209
with Oscar the Grouch.

22:22.083 --> 22:23.083
Please!

22:23.084 --> 22:24.084
Like I know celebrities.

22:26.083 --> 22:28.083
- Jessie,
- I'm really sorry about Earl.

22:28.876 --> 22:30.084
You're forgiven.

22:30.085 --> 22:31.292
And to prove it,

22:31.334 --> 22:33.167
I made you a special dinner.

22:34.125 --> 22:35.626
- (SING SONG)
- Hope you're hungry!

22:40.334 --> 22:41.688
Ew! But this

22:41.689 --> 22:43.042
has bite marks!

22:43.083 --> 22:44.647
Yeah. I got the recipe

22:44.648 --> 22:46.209
from your best friend,

22:43.083 --> 22:46.209
"Eddie Earl." Enjoy!

22:47.083 --> 22:49.042
(PANTING)

22:50.000 --> 22:51.084
Oh, Bertram,

22:51.085 --> 22:52.167
Tony and I are good now.

22:52.209 --> 22:54.000
- You don't have to
- keep taking the stairs.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.605
I didn't. I just went across

22:55.606 --> 22:57.125
the hall to dump the trash.

22:57.959 --> 22:59.085
Ow! Cramp, cramp,

22:59.086 --> 23:00.209
cramp! (GRUNTING)
