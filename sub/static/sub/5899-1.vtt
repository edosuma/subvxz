00:53.803 --> 00:55.929
Hello. I'm Mr. Williams.
Thank you for coming.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.640
Please. And you are?

00:58.808 --> 01:00.768
- Fred Miller.
- You must be...?

01:00.935 --> 01:02.603
Wallace. James Wallace.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.647
Great. Please. Have a seat.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.445
Now, before we do anything else,
allow me to pay you.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.364
Please check that both names
are spelled correctly.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.826
You understand that this is yours
simply for coming to the lab.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.871
From now on, no matter what happens,
the money is yours.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.664
I'll have to have you sign a receipt.

01:24.292 --> 01:26.710
There you go.
Now, psychologists have developed

01:26.878 --> 01:29.296
several theories on how humans learn.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.673
Uh, for example, it might help
to reward a person.

01:31.841 --> 01:33.425
Sometimes it helps to punish them.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.886
We do know that punishment...
Thank you very much.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.597
...is a powerful incentive
towards learning.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.557
For example,
when a parent spanks a child.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.807
However, in fact, we actually know
very little about

01:42.894 --> 01:46.021
the effect of punishment on learning,
because almost no scientific studies

01:46.189 --> 01:48.315
have been done of it on human beings.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.611
Now, one of you will play
the role of learner,

01:52.779 --> 01:54.099
who will receive a mild
punishment

01:54.197 --> 01:56.907
if he answers incorrectly
to a series of questions.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.576
That punishment will be
administered by a teacher.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.621
What kind of punishment
are we talking about?

02:02.789 --> 02:04.873
Well, first, let's determine
which of you

02:05.041 --> 02:07.042
will be learner and which
will be teacher.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.377
If you'll just choose one.

02:10.547 --> 02:11.713
Good.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.134
Teacher.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.052
I guess I'm the learner, huh?

02:17.679 --> 02:18.846
Good.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.559
This is the machine for
generating electric shocks.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.727
Go ahead.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.431
Now, let's set up the learner
to receive some punishment.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.247
If you'll just follow me
into the next room.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.573
- Is it okay if I leave my hat here?
- Yes, that's fine.

02:40.493 --> 02:42.119
Now, you might wanna
remove the jacket.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.663
Go ahead and have a seat.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.584
Now, when you push one of
these four buttons,

02:48.751 --> 02:50.836
this box will signal
a light in the other room,

02:51.004 --> 02:53.088
telling the teacher how you're
responding to the questions.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.048
What kind of questions?

02:55.216 --> 02:56.216
Multiple choice.

02:56.384 --> 03:00.179
Word pairs. "Strong arm",
"black curtain", and so forth.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.222
Now, we want you to memorize them.

03:02.390 --> 03:05.017
The teacher will first read them
as word pairs,

03:05.185 --> 03:08.353
"strong arm", for example,
then he'll read only the first word,

03:08.521 --> 03:10.981
"strong", followed by
a series of word choices.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.817
"Back, arm, branch, and push".

03:13.985 --> 03:16.403
Your job is to remember
which of those words

03:16.571 --> 03:18.611
was originally paired with
the first word, "strong".

03:18.740 --> 03:19.948
- Arm.
- Right.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.951
Now you would indicate that by
pushing one of these buttons here.

03:23.119 --> 03:25.662
If you had thought it was the
first word I had read, "back",

03:25.830 --> 03:27.331
you'd push this first button here.

03:27.498 --> 03:29.458
If you thought it was
the second word, "arm",

03:29.626 --> 03:31.752
you'd push the second button,
so on and so forth with

03:31.920 --> 03:33.337
third and fourth word choices.

03:34.255 --> 03:38.091
Now, if you get the answer incorrect,
you will receive an electric shock.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.003
Would you please roll up
your right arm sleeve, please?

03:41.930 --> 03:45.307
Would you just help me strap him
in to limit any excess movement?

03:45.475 --> 03:46.767
How far do you think he'll go?

03:47.393 --> 03:49.193
- Now this is connected...
- Too soon to tell.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.063
...to the shock generator
in the next room.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.399
- Electrode paste.
- And electrode paste,

03:54.567 --> 03:56.985
to eliminate any excess burns
or blisters.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.447
You know, I should say that
a couple of years ago,

04:00.615 --> 04:02.574
in the West Haven VA Hospital,

04:02.742 --> 04:06.912
they determined that I had
a slight heart condition.

04:07.080 --> 04:11.792
Nothing serious, but how
dangerous are these shocks?

04:12.543 --> 04:14.878
Well, although the shocks may be
extremely painful,

04:15.046 --> 04:17.505
they cause
no permanent tissue damage.

04:18.591 --> 04:19.966
Oh. Okay.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.428
Well, we'll be communicating
from the next room.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.889
The lab coat,
I decided to make it grey.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.350
White would seem too medical.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.661
- Okay.
- Thank you.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.414
Now, if he gets the answer
incorrect, you administer

04:50.581 --> 04:53.875
the shock by flipping one of
these switches here. You see?

04:54.502 --> 04:57.087
Each switch has
a little red light above it.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.841
Now, to give you, the teacher,
an idea of the amount of shock

05:01.009 --> 05:03.135
the learner will be receiving,
we think it's only fair that

05:03.344 --> 05:05.971
you receive a sample shock yourself.
Is that all right?

05:06.889 --> 05:09.182
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, just roll up your sleeve.

05:09.726 --> 05:14.604
Life can only be understood backwards
but it must be lived forwards.

05:15.565 --> 05:16.648
Good.

05:17.150 --> 05:21.486
Now, I'll ask you to close your
eyes and just estimate for me

05:21.654 --> 05:23.613
the amount of volts
you think you're receiving.

05:25.825 --> 05:26.867
Okay, close.

05:30.413 --> 05:33.915
This part, this part's where
the experiment really begins.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.301
Now, if you will just use this scale
here to tell me the amount of volts

05:44.552 --> 05:46.470
you think you received
in the sample shock.

05:47.221 --> 05:49.348
Pfff, one ninety-five?

05:49.682 --> 05:52.851
No, actually, that's incorrect.
It was 45 volts.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.189
All right.

06:01.652 --> 06:06.365
Okay, learner...
I'm going to read you the words,

06:06.532 --> 06:08.700
and then I'm gonna
repeat the first word

06:08.868 --> 06:12.871
and you're going to tell me
the pair for that word. Okay?

06:13.039 --> 06:16.166
He doesn't have a microphone
but he can hear you.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.252
Keep it moving, understand?
Remember that each time he gives

06:19.420 --> 06:22.339
a wrong answer, you move up one
switch on the shock generator.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.758
It is important that you follow
the procedure exactly.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.676
Okay.

06:26.844 --> 06:28.261
Okay, here we go.

06:29.263 --> 06:32.015
"Blue girl. Nice day.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.976
Fat neck. Green ink.

06:35.144 --> 06:37.771
Rich boy. Fast bird.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.774
Blunt arrow. Soft hair.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.568
Cool cave. Gold paint."

06:45.613 --> 06:46.863
In the first word.

06:47.698 --> 06:52.369
"Blue: Boy, girl, grass, bat."

06:52.912 --> 06:55.580
Correct.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.334
"Soft rug..."

06:59.502 --> 07:01.753
- He finds his way into it.
- "Pillow, hair, rat."

07:01.921 --> 07:05.298
With increasing confidence
he finds a rhythm, a groove.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.467
That is incorrect.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.760
Until...

07:09.011 --> 07:10.679
Ninety volts.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.691
- Um...
- Here we go.

07:22.900 --> 07:27.237
"Gold:
Dollar, necklace, moon, paint."

07:30.950 --> 07:35.745
Incorrect. One hundred
and twenty volts. Gold paint.

07:37.123 --> 07:41.460
"Hard: Stone, head, bread, work."

07:46.007 --> 07:49.718
Incorrect.
One hundred and thirty five volts.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.686
Okay.

07:59.979 --> 08:04.941
"Wet: Night, grass, duck, cloth."

08:07.153 --> 08:10.864
Incorrect. One hundred
and fifty volts. Wet duck.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.952
It really hurts.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.205
Mmm.

08:19.957 --> 08:21.500
How do you know
when a change,

08:21.709 --> 08:23.251
a true and lasting change,

08:23.836 --> 08:25.420
is about to overtake your life?

08:25.588 --> 08:27.589
"...grass, man, girl..."

08:33.929 --> 08:35.931
- Eighth floor, please.
- The same.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.403
Are we going to the same party?

08:51.781 --> 08:54.533
Probably. You know Doris Eissenman?

08:55.117 --> 08:56.910
Saul Harwood's invited me.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.704
Ah.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.206
I've never heard of him.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.339
Shall we continue talking or wait
till we're properly introduced?

09:45.710 --> 09:46.751
You're a dancer?

09:46.919 --> 09:49.796
Oh, well,
I studied, here and in Paris.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.966
- But, uh... I work in an office now.
- Mmm-hm.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.719
- What about you?
- I'm at Yale.

09:56.387 --> 09:59.014
Limited dance skills, although
I did spend some time in Paris.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.809
What are you studying at Yale?

10:03.019 --> 10:05.061
I teach, actually. Social Relations.

10:05.229 --> 10:07.689
Did you just give that guy there
your phone number?

10:09.358 --> 10:11.359
So if I wanted your number
I can get it from him?

10:13.362 --> 10:14.571
Social Relations.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.408
- What does that mean?
- It's a combination.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.577
Sociology, anthropology, psychology.

10:21.662 --> 10:24.914
You know, basically covers
everything from

10:25.082 --> 10:27.250
the way people talk in elevators
to the study of

10:27.418 --> 10:29.919
role-playing, conformity, authority.

10:30.129 --> 10:35.216
Rug,
pillow, hair, grass."

10:40.222 --> 10:42.307
Incorrect. A hundred and...

10:43.726 --> 10:45.769
sixty-five volts, strong shock.

10:45.936 --> 10:49.064
Ah! Let me out of here!

10:49.231 --> 10:51.483
I told you, I have a heart condition.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.527
I will not be part of
the experiment anymore!

10:54.695 --> 10:58.031
- He says he's not gonna go on.
- Please continue, teacher.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.284
He says he doesn't want to go on.

11:01.661 --> 11:05.205
Well, whether the learner
likes it or not, he must go on

11:05.373 --> 11:07.415
until he's learned
all the pairs correctly.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.417
Please continue, teacher.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.421
Uh...

11:15.341 --> 11:18.468
Calm down, concentrate.

11:20.054 --> 11:26.393
"Sad: Face, music, clown, girl."

11:30.606 --> 11:33.358
Incorrect.
One hundred and eighty volts.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.903
Ahh! Dammit!
Let me out, let me out!

11:37.071 --> 11:39.572
He went all the way.
Most of them do.

11:41.242 --> 11:45.161
"Sharp. Axe, needle, stick, blade."

11:48.582 --> 11:52.001
No response from the learner must be
interpreted as a wrong answer.

11:53.754 --> 11:58.049
Still laughing,
trying to hide face with hand.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.969
Something's happening
to that man in there.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.596
Can you please go check that
everything's okay?

12:04.098 --> 12:05.682
Not once we've started.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.517
Please continue, teacher.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.436
So you accept all responsibility?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.438
The responsibility
is mine, correct.

12:12.565 --> 12:13.815
Continue, please.

12:17.027 --> 12:20.029
Night, grass, duck, cloth."

12:21.615 --> 12:24.576
Clenching fist,
pushing it onto table.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.960
- How are you holding up, Alan?
- Necklace,

12:34.128 --> 12:37.338
moon, paint."
Three hundred and seventy five volts.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.591
Dangerous, severe shock.

12:41.927 --> 12:45.847
Let me out of here, let me out.
Get me out of here.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.558
You can't hold me in here.
Get me out.

13:04.033 --> 13:06.701
- What is this?
- I just liked the picture.

13:06.869 --> 13:10.246
The colors... Don't you?

13:10.414 --> 13:11.581
Yeah.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.501
Take it. It's yours.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.380
Why don't you mail it to me?

13:24.011 --> 13:25.811
Or we could leave it here
and you can move in?

13:29.099 --> 13:30.475
That'd be easier, wouldn't it?

13:38.734 --> 13:44.447
"Wet: Night, grass, duck, cloth."

13:50.412 --> 13:54.290
"Wet duck." Four hundred
and thirty five volts.

13:56.627 --> 13:57.794
Huh.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.507
Ohh.

14:02.716 --> 14:08.930
Okay, um... "Brave: Woman, soldier,
dog, horse."

14:14.854 --> 14:16.229
"Brave woman."

14:17.356 --> 14:19.023
Four hundred and fifty volts.

14:22.736 --> 14:26.781
Okay, what now?
I'm at the end at 450 volts.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.492
Continue, please.

14:29.660 --> 14:30.910
The last switch again.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.163
Yeah, but...
but he could be dead in there.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.583
The experiment
requires that you continue.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.626
Go on, please.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.087
And his health doesn't mean anything?

14:41.255 --> 14:44.215
Whether the learner likes it or not,
we must continue.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.509
I'm sorry, look,
I don't mean to be rude, sir,

14:46.677 --> 14:49.304
but I think you should
go look in on him. I mean,

14:49.471 --> 14:52.515
all you have to do is look in on him.
Look into that door.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.727
'Cause I'm not getting any noise,
I'm not getting no sound here.

14:56.645 --> 14:57.812
We must continue.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.482
Go on, please,
the next word is "white".

15:19.043 --> 15:25.214
Cloud, horse,
rock, house."

15:27.134 --> 15:30.678
White horse.
Four hundred and fifty volts again.

15:35.851 --> 15:40.855
"Fair: Price, rule, skin, sky."

15:44.818 --> 15:47.278
Wrong. 450 again.

15:49.198 --> 15:52.742
All right, thank you.
We are done with the experiment.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.118
Okay.

15:54.286 --> 15:55.886
I'm just going
to speak with the learner.

15:55.996 --> 15:58.831
I think he might be a little upset.
In the meantime,

15:58.999 --> 16:01.084
my assistant would like
to ask you a few questions,

16:01.251 --> 16:04.462
- if you don't mind?
- Yeah, surely.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.047
Dr. Milgram?

16:06.715 --> 16:07.966
How do you do?

16:11.553 --> 16:14.430
Uh, first I'd like...
No, thank you.

16:15.182 --> 16:18.101
- I'd like to ask you some questions.
- Yes, surely.

16:24.817 --> 16:28.194
Uh, why did you give him,
the man in the other room,

16:28.362 --> 16:30.238
the learner, the shocks?

16:30.823 --> 16:33.616
Well, as you could see,
I wanted to stop 'cause...

16:34.576 --> 16:36.619
each time you gave him a shock
the guy hollered.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.955
Did it sound as if he was in pain?

16:41.166 --> 16:42.250
Yeah.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.336
Did he say he wanted you
to stop the experiment?

16:45.879 --> 16:46.879
Yes.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.757
Did he have a right
to stop the experiment?

16:51.802 --> 16:53.094
I don't know.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.139
Why didn't you stop,
at that point,

16:56.306 --> 16:58.766
- when he asked you to stop?
- Why didn't I stop?

16:58.934 --> 17:00.643
- Mm-hm.
- Well, 'cause...

17:00.811 --> 17:02.603
'Cause he told me to continue.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.606
Why did you listen to that man
and not the man in pain?

17:10.904 --> 17:13.448
Well, 'cause... 'cause I thought
the experiment depended on me.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.992
- And nobody told me to stop.
- He asked you to stop.

17:18.369 --> 17:21.204
That... That's true, but he's the...

17:22.958 --> 17:24.541
you know, the subject, shall we say?

17:25.544 --> 17:27.002
Who was the...

17:28.422 --> 17:31.799
Who bore the responsibility for the
fact this man was being shocked?

17:36.638 --> 17:37.847
I don't know.

17:42.478 --> 17:45.313
Could you fill out items six
through 18 on the questionnaire

17:45.522 --> 17:48.608
in front of you, please?
Here's a pen.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.492
Ah, I get a little skittish.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.453
Uh... nervous.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.790
As I explained to
Mr. Wallace in the other room,

18:04.458 --> 18:06.918
this shock generator's actually
used for small animals

18:07.086 --> 18:10.088
for laboratory experiments.
Mice, rats, and so forth.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.509
The visual designation
is actually misleading.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.196
This shock generator's actually
been adjusted so that the shocks

18:17.346 --> 18:20.431
were just slightly stronger
than the shock you experienced.

18:20.766 --> 18:21.974
Are you all right?

18:23.268 --> 18:25.353
Yeah, I'm fine, you know.

18:26.271 --> 18:30.399
No hard feelings. I probably would've
done the same thing myself.

18:31.318 --> 18:32.485
Ciao.

18:35.781 --> 18:38.741
Each subject has a
reconciliation with the learner.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.660
We ask the subject
to maintain a secrecy

18:40.828 --> 18:42.870
so that future recruits
aren't tipped off.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.665
Down the line
we get more candid.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.235
The first thing
I wanna tell you is

18:48.377 --> 18:50.711
the man in the other room
wasn't being shocked.

18:50.879 --> 18:54.132
The only real shock was
the one that you felt early on.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.176
We're really interested in
studying your reaction

18:57.344 --> 19:00.513
to having to inflict pain on
someone you don't know.

19:00.681 --> 19:03.432
The experiment's about
obeying orders.

19:04.184 --> 19:06.769
The man in the other room
works with us as a team.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.604
Jim, you can come out now.

19:08.939 --> 19:11.774
He wasn't really being shocked,
he's perfectly fine.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.192
We weren't trying to fool you,

19:13.360 --> 19:15.611
we're just interested
in studying your reactions.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.656
Man, you dog.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.909
I... I was worried sick.
I thought I was...

19:22.077 --> 19:25.204
You're a good fella.
No hard feelings, no hard feelings.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.582
But you thought
you were really shocking him.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.584
When he wasn't making noise
anymore,

19:29.751 --> 19:32.587
that's when I was worried.
I didn't wanna go on with it.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.839
- But you did go on with it.
- Yeah, but I did not want to.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.091
You saw how it was,
how I was fighting it.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.637
Well, you understand why
we had to do it this way.

19:41.805 --> 19:45.683
We wanted to get true reactions
from people, you see?

19:46.810 --> 19:49.478
You'll receive a copy of the
report when the project's over.

19:49.646 --> 19:51.397
Until then, we ask you not to
say anything.

19:51.648 --> 19:55.526
You may end up talking to someone
who is a potential participant.

19:57.154 --> 20:00.656
How do you feel about having
come down here and done this,

20:00.824 --> 20:01.908
now that you know?

20:02.659 --> 20:03.951
I mean...

20:04.786 --> 20:07.747
Now that I know the truth,
I don't mind.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.708
Well, thank you very much
for coming down.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.419
We certainly do appreciate you
giving us your time.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.589
- Yeah, yeah.
- Alan here will help you out.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.550
We think you'll find the report
very interesting.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.637
Thanks. Yeah, thank you.

20:31.855 --> 20:34.857
I still get nervous.
You're cool as ice.

20:36.318 --> 20:38.778
Maybe all those years of
teaching high school

20:38.946 --> 20:41.322
- gives you sort of a...
- Poker face?

20:41.490 --> 20:43.157
Discipline, I was thinking.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.368
You're like a gravedigger.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.662
I think you mean undertaker.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.458
The domino effect starts to kick in,
in the teacher's mind,

20:52.626 --> 20:53.626
once he assumes the role.

20:55.712 --> 20:58.631
Get some women in here.
Get my wife in this seat...

20:59.675 --> 21:01.467
We've got nine kids,
the first squawk

21:01.635 --> 21:03.135
she'd stop the whole shebang.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.221
Nine kids.
Are you sure about that?

21:05.389 --> 21:09.308
Oh, yeah. I have enough saved up
to give 'em each a pair of socks

21:09.476 --> 21:11.394
if the electricity gets me.

21:11.561 --> 21:14.230
You're a brave man, Jim.
All right, next subject's due.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.648
I should get going.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.990
♪ Some enchanted evening ♪

21:24.157 --> 21:27.034
♪ You will meet a stranger ♪

21:31.039 --> 21:33.124
I was born in the Bronx, 1933.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.502
My father's from Hungary,
my mother Romania,

21:36.670 --> 21:40.047
Jewish immigrants. It was a
matter of chance they arrived

21:40.215 --> 21:42.925
in the US as children and
managed to raise a family in

21:43.093 --> 21:46.178
New York instead of being swept
up into the extermination camps

21:46.346 --> 21:48.848
and murdered by the Nazis,
like millions of others like them

21:49.016 --> 21:50.266
in Eastern Europe.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.601
That's really what's behind

21:52.769 --> 21:56.689
the obedience experiments.
The inkling I was chasing...

21:57.941 --> 21:59.191
the thing that troubled me.

22:02.863 --> 22:05.072
How do civilized human beings

22:05.282 --> 22:08.242
participate in destructive,
inhumane acts?

22:08.744 --> 22:12.997
How was genocide implemented so
systematically, so efficiently?

22:13.165 --> 22:15.207
And how did the perpetrators of
these murders

22:15.375 --> 22:16.625
live with themselves?

22:30.349 --> 22:33.309
My daughter, Michele,
a precocious child

22:33.477 --> 22:35.686
who at this point in the story
hasn't yet been born,

22:36.104 --> 22:38.981
used to tell the kids at school,
"My dad's a psychologist,

22:39.149 --> 22:41.359
but not the kind who talks to
people lying down.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.195
He's an experimental
psychologist.

22:45.572 --> 22:46.822
He does experiments."

22:52.412 --> 22:54.452
First let's determine which of
you will be "learner"

22:54.581 --> 22:56.082
and which will be "teacher."

23:01.713 --> 23:02.797
"Teacher."

23:03.256 --> 23:06.008
They both say that.
And no one's caught on?

23:06.176 --> 23:08.552
- Not a soul.
- Not the corporate manager,

23:08.720 --> 23:11.389
the banker, the plumber,
the Good Humor man.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.933
The Good Humor man
was actually vicious.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.727
Crude mesomorph of obviously
limited intelligence.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.939
The script has kind of momentum.
It carries them along.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.691
- Men only?
- Every hour.

23:22.859 --> 23:25.528
It's getting to be a blur,
really.

23:25.695 --> 23:28.656
So you lead them both,
both the teacher and learner,

23:28.824 --> 23:32.368
into the... electric chair?

23:34.162 --> 23:35.788
Well, we don't call it that,

23:35.956 --> 23:38.958
but, yes, if you'll follow me
into the next room, please?

23:45.006 --> 23:46.215
Here's my home.

23:46.716 --> 23:49.260
I think I'd go nuts in this
little room all day.

23:49.428 --> 23:52.638
Well, they keep me busy. Agh!

23:52.806 --> 23:54.223
Actually, I have
a heart condition.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.391
Really?

23:55.559 --> 23:58.227
It does give you authenticity,
I think, in the part.

23:58.395 --> 24:01.313
But I think I'm a better actor
than I am accountant.

24:01.481 --> 24:02.841
It's nearly time for the next one.

24:02.899 --> 24:06.110
- Oh.
- Is somebody in there?

24:06.903 --> 24:08.195
Maybe Alan.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.739
- Shall we join him?
- Sure.

24:14.119 --> 24:16.287
To give you, the teacher,
an idea of how much shock

24:16.455 --> 24:18.575
the learner will be receiving,
we think it's only fair

24:18.707 --> 24:21.584
you receive a sample shock yourself.
Is that all right?

24:21.751 --> 24:23.752
- Fair enough.
- Give me your right arm, please.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.713
This is the only real shock, right?

24:25.881 --> 24:27.173
Mm-hm.

24:27.340 --> 24:28.674
Have you done it?

24:29.342 --> 24:31.260
Been shocked like that,
literally?

24:31.428 --> 24:33.220
- Yeah.
- Yes, it's not pleasant.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.559
Now if you'll just
use the scale here

24:38.727 --> 24:40.311
to estimate for me
the amount of volts you think

24:40.479 --> 24:42.354
you've received
in the sample shock.

24:45.108 --> 24:47.985
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Well, that was only 45 volts.

24:48.361 --> 24:50.196
So go ahead and begin the test.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.948
He doesn't have a microphone
but he can hear you.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.909
Just speak into the microphone.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.744
The rooms are partially
soundproof.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.371
Are you ready, learner?

25:01.041 --> 25:03.626
Continues with
robotic impassivity,

25:04.044 --> 25:06.003
courteous to experimenter.

25:06.379 --> 25:08.756
Seems to derive no pleasure
from the act itself.

25:08.924 --> 25:11.634
Incorrect.

25:13.261 --> 25:14.929
The correct answer is "box".

25:15.096 --> 25:17.723
Curt and officious
when saying "Correct".

25:17.891 --> 25:19.350
Seventy-five volts.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.603
Let me out of here!

25:22.771 --> 25:24.980
Each time
he administers a shock,

25:25.815 --> 25:27.900
lips drawn back, bares his teeth.

25:30.779 --> 25:34.406
"Sweet: Candy, girl, taste, pickle."

25:36.159 --> 25:39.453
Wrong. "Sweet taste."
One hundred and twenty volts.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.415
Let me out of here!

25:46.044 --> 25:47.962
Looks sadly
at the experimenter

25:48.129 --> 25:50.214
and continues reading word pairs.

25:55.136 --> 25:59.098
Wrong. "True story".
One hundred and thirty five volts.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.060
"Slow, walk..."

26:03.228 --> 26:06.438
Afterwards, if a learner
who says he agreed to it

26:06.648 --> 26:09.024
and therefore must accept
responsibility.

26:09.192 --> 26:13.279
Wrong. "Slow music."
One hundred and fifty volts.

26:14.030 --> 26:16.282
Let me out of here!

26:16.491 --> 26:17.950
I can't stand the pain.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.413
The man, he seems to be getting hurt.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.457
There's no
permanent tissue damage.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.127
Yes, but I know
what shocks do to you.

26:28.295 --> 26:32.172
I'm an electrical engineer,
and I have had shocks.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.384
You get real shook up by them,

26:36.386 --> 26:38.512
especially if you know
the next one is coming.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.515
I'm sorry.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.310
It's absolutely
essential that you do continue.

26:44.477 --> 26:48.230
Well, I won't, not with the man
screaming to get out.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.899
You have
no other choice.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.406
Why don't I have a choice?

26:59.159 --> 27:01.577
I came here on my own free will.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.163
I thought I could help
in a research project.

27:04.331 --> 27:08.959
But if I have to hurt somebody,
if I was in his place...

27:10.754 --> 27:12.963
No, I can't continue.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.719
I've probably gone too far already.
I'm very sorry.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.188
I could've wept.

27:29.814 --> 27:32.149
I mean he looked like
he wanted to slug me.

27:33.026 --> 27:35.611
Out of gratitude, you do understand,
I mean wept.

27:35.779 --> 27:37.655
Because all day we've been

27:37.864 --> 27:40.074
getting nothing but "wrong," zzzt.

27:42.869 --> 27:46.121
You do realize I have to sit and
listen to you scream all day.

27:46.289 --> 27:49.249
Well, so do I.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.669
He was what, Danish?

27:51.836 --> 27:53.253
Dutch, actually.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.382
Right, but it wasn't his
nationality that caused him

27:56.549 --> 27:59.218
to stop, it was the fact he
worked with electricity.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.552
Hmm.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.514
They all seem
to wanna impress you...

28:03.973 --> 28:05.974
- for some reason.
- Mm-hm.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.310
But why?

28:09.604 --> 28:11.939
Why do so many,
the vast majority,

28:12.107 --> 28:14.483
push all the way through
to the final switch?

28:14.651 --> 28:19.029
Why is the Dutchman's defiance
the anomaly instead of the norm?

28:19.781 --> 28:22.199
All the psychiatrists and
psychologists I consulted

28:22.367 --> 28:25.035
were convinced we'd have trouble
finding a single person

28:25.203 --> 28:27.454
that'd go all the way through
to the end. I'd have been

28:27.622 --> 28:29.873
better off consulting the guy
from Pepe's Pizza.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.291
Oh, you mean Pepe?

28:31.459 --> 28:33.001
I think his name is Carmine.

28:33.503 --> 28:36.046
Well, you get my point.
The butcher, the baker,

28:36.214 --> 28:37.715
the candlestick maker.

28:38.758 --> 28:42.302
I'd like to try it,
the test shock.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.265
I just wanna...
know what it feels like.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.809
Sasha.

28:49.102 --> 28:52.813
I don't even think about that,
and I've been in there

28:52.981 --> 28:55.315
supposedly getting
zapped to the maximum.

29:00.488 --> 29:01.905
This really isn't necessary.

29:02.657 --> 29:04.867
Well, yeah,
but it's not harmful either.

29:05.201 --> 29:07.536
I mean I just wanna
understand it better.

29:08.455 --> 29:09.538
Okay.

29:13.710 --> 29:14.835
Other arm.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.935
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:39.235 --> 29:41.236
I designed
a series of variations,

29:41.404 --> 29:43.322
25 in all, and continued
the experiments

29:43.490 --> 29:44.990
over the next two semesters.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.310
We adjust the script so that
the learner bangs on the wall...

29:49.454 --> 29:51.455
but says nothing.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.502
We asked the teacher
to physically press

29:56.669 --> 30:00.047
the learner's hand on a copper plate,
forcing him to receive the shock.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.215
House.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.050
Wrong. A hundred
and thirty five volts.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.899
We move the experiment
into a shabby office

30:06.012 --> 30:09.807
in Bridgeport, to deduct the
potential intimidation factor

30:09.974 --> 30:14.853
of Ivy League prestige.
And, back at Yale, we include women.

30:17.315 --> 30:18.524
What did you just do?

30:20.151 --> 30:21.777
Uh, he said: "Ow."

30:22.529 --> 30:24.238
Did you turn off the machine?

30:26.533 --> 30:30.160
I... I thought that if it seemed
like I...

30:31.329 --> 30:32.621
you know, turn...

30:40.672 --> 30:41.755
Okay.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.382
"Short..."

30:43.550 --> 30:44.758
The machine?

30:49.556 --> 30:51.014
Please continue, teacher.

30:54.561 --> 31:00.774
Okay, "Short: Sentence, movie,
time, skirt."

31:05.446 --> 31:07.990
I'm sorry, that's wrong.
It's "short time".

31:18.710 --> 31:22.170
In nearly every case,
the essential results are the same.

31:22.338 --> 31:25.090
They hesitate, sigh, tremble
and groan,

31:25.258 --> 31:28.093
but they advance to the last
switch, 450 volts,

31:28.261 --> 31:32.681
"Danger Severe Shock XXX",
because they're politely told to.

31:35.518 --> 31:37.436
The results are
terrifying and depressing.

31:38.479 --> 31:40.564
They suggest that the kind of
character produced

31:40.732 --> 31:43.525
in American society
can't be counted on

31:43.693 --> 31:46.445
to insulate its citizens from
brutality and

31:46.613 --> 31:50.365
inhumane treatment in response
to a malevolent authority.

31:53.077 --> 31:56.872
Milgram? Milgram is
Hebrew for pomegranate.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.540
Is that what you mean?
It's one of the seven fruits

31:58.708 --> 32:00.959
- of the Bible.
- You're Jewish, same as me.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.546
You seem upset.
Am I upsetting you?

32:04.714 --> 32:06.715
I have office hours.
You can make an appointment.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.134
Huh? You don't like surprises.

32:09.969 --> 32:12.169
You know, I've been thinking
about the experiment a lot.

32:12.597 --> 32:15.015
It really rattled my wife
about what it said about me.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.894
If she was me, she liked to think
she wouldn't have pulled the switch.

32:19.687 --> 32:21.813
- But you know what?
- What?

32:22.565 --> 32:24.565
You never know.
That's the thing, how can you know?

32:24.692 --> 32:26.610
- You can't, right?
- No, you can't.

32:27.236 --> 32:29.738
If it's any consolation,
a great many participants

32:29.906 --> 32:31.156
were prone to nervous laughter,

32:31.324 --> 32:34.743
but my wife actually is waiting
for me at home for dinner,

32:34.911 --> 32:36.995
- so...
- Are you inviting me?

32:37.163 --> 32:40.374
No. Make an appointment.

32:44.712 --> 32:46.880
With leftover grant money
we film the last two days

32:47.048 --> 32:50.550
of the experiment,
May 26 and 27th, 1962.

32:51.469 --> 32:54.554
Four days later, Adolf Eichmann
is executed in Jerusalem.

32:58.393 --> 33:00.852
Eichmann, architect of
the Holocaust,

33:01.020 --> 33:04.523
responsible for the deportation
and murder of millions of Jews,

33:04.691 --> 33:07.109
escaped to Argentina after
World War II.

33:09.195 --> 33:12.364
He was living with his family
under the name Ricardo Klement,

33:13.241 --> 33:15.492
an employee of Mercedes-Benz,

33:15.660 --> 33:18.328
when Israeli Mossad agents
captured him in 1960

33:18.496 --> 33:19.871
and brought him to trial.

33:20.456 --> 33:22.791
...to completed
the translations,

33:22.959 --> 33:25.377
I beg to submit a translation

33:25.545 --> 33:28.755
into the German of our number, 887.

33:28.923 --> 33:31.133
Eichmann didn't
deny his crimes,

33:31.843 --> 33:34.011
showed no trace of guilt
or remorse.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.638
Said he was merely a transmitter.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.391
"I never did anything great or small

33:39.559 --> 33:43.186
without express instructions
from my superiors."

33:50.111 --> 33:54.239
The cradle rocks above an
abyss and common sense tells us

33:54.407 --> 33:57.909
that our existence is but
a brief crack of light between

33:58.077 --> 34:00.162
two eternities of darkness.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.630
Let me out of here!
Hey, that really hurts!

34:10.797 --> 34:12.799
I told you,
I have a heart condition!

34:12.967 --> 34:15.302
I will not be in
this experiment anymore!

34:15.469 --> 34:17.512
Ow! Let me out.

34:17.679 --> 34:19.681
Let me outta here! Let me out!

34:19.849 --> 34:23.268
Let... me... out... of here.

34:24.145 --> 34:28.440
♪ I will no longer be here ♪

34:32.027 --> 34:34.529
Ah, hey, Stanley,
a nice day to wrap up

34:34.697 --> 34:37.741
- the new obedience experiment.
- Yeah, yeah.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.161
Hmm.

34:43.706 --> 34:47.583
I should tell you about Asch.
Solomon E. Asch.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.879
He oversaw my thesis at
Harvard, and I worked for him,

34:51.047 --> 34:52.755
diligently and miserably,

34:52.924 --> 34:55.759
at the Institute for Advanced Study
at Princeton.

34:57.011 --> 34:59.638
Asch did the thing with the lines,
right?

34:59.806 --> 35:01.223
About a dozen years ago.

35:01.390 --> 35:05.352
The study you are taking part in
today involves the perception

35:05.520 --> 35:07.687
of the lengths of lines.

35:08.106 --> 35:11.108
As you can see, there are
a number of cards,

35:11.275 --> 35:14.152
and on each card there are
several lines.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.239
Your task is a very simple one.

35:17.406 --> 35:20.617
You're to look at the line on
the left and determine which of

35:20.785 --> 35:23.912
the three lines on the right
is equal to it in length.

35:25.915 --> 35:28.875
This is a recreation
from a film I made in the 70's.

35:29.043 --> 35:31.628
Five of the six participants are
confederates.

35:31.796 --> 35:34.840
The single true subject
in the white T-shirt

35:35.007 --> 35:38.510
hears everyone else's answers
before announcing his decision.

35:38.719 --> 35:40.804
- Two.
- Two.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.681
- Two.
- Two.

35:42.849 --> 35:43.849
Two.

35:44.016 --> 35:47.561
Very good. Let's move onto
the next card. Same thing, gentlemen.

35:47.728 --> 35:50.063
- Three.
- Three.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.774
- Three.
- Three.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.902
After the first few
rounds, members of the group

35:56.070 --> 35:57.487
choose the wrong line.

35:57.655 --> 35:59.739
- Two.
- Two.

35:59.907 --> 36:02.701
The subject denies
the evidence of his own eyes

36:03.369 --> 36:05.162
and yields to group influence.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.580
Two.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.082
Very good. Thank you.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.459
In the language of social science,
the experiment

36:11.627 --> 36:14.546
was known as "The Effect of Group
Pressure Upon the Modification

36:14.714 --> 36:18.425
- and Distortion of Judgments."
- Pff. Great title.

36:18.593 --> 36:19.968
It made Asch famous...

36:21.512 --> 36:22.971
amongst social scientists.

36:35.818 --> 36:38.904
It always bothered me that
the experiment was about lines.

36:39.071 --> 36:41.364
I wanted to do something
more humanly significant.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.247
He hears the bell.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.750
Stanley, it's so good
to see you.

36:51.918 --> 36:55.170
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- This is Sasha.

36:55.338 --> 36:58.590
Sasha, how are you?
So lovely to see you. Come in.

36:58.758 --> 36:59.841
- Stanley
- How are you?

37:00.009 --> 37:01.134
Glad you made it.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.474
Can we tell you what a miserable
time I had working for Asch?

37:07.642 --> 37:11.770
Princeton, the bureaucracy,
the institutional arrogance.

37:11.938 --> 37:14.773
Not permitted to use a scrap of
paper without it becoming

37:15.024 --> 37:17.692
an issue to be settled behind
closed doors.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.279
A candy bar in the office

37:21.447 --> 37:23.573
and I was reported
via formal letter.

37:24.408 --> 37:27.088
I assumed he'd introduce me to
the leading intellectuals of the day.

37:27.203 --> 37:28.495
This did not happen.

37:28.663 --> 37:31.998
I assumed that he'd acknowledge
me in the book I was researching

37:32.166 --> 37:34.000
for him, a book on conformity.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.921
He did not finish the book.

37:38.339 --> 37:41.049
It was like drinking from
a glass with a false bottom.

37:41.217 --> 37:43.551
I thought there'd be more.
I was thirsty.

37:43.719 --> 37:46.554
Please call me Sholem,
I would prefer it.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.390
There's no need to be so stuffy.

37:49.016 --> 37:51.101
In an elevator? Really?

37:52.103 --> 37:53.645
They met in an elevator.

37:54.313 --> 37:56.398
Can someone please pacify
the dog?

37:57.733 --> 38:00.527
Here I am,
still trying to impress him.

38:00.695 --> 38:02.904
Human nature can be studied
but not escaped,

38:03.114 --> 38:04.531
especially your own.

38:05.408 --> 38:07.617
Well, I was on my way
into this party

38:07.785 --> 38:10.120
and I could feel somebody
walking behind me

38:10.288 --> 38:13.039
as I went into the building.
We both got onto the elevator,

38:13.207 --> 38:15.709
and it turned out we were going
to the same floor.

38:15.876 --> 38:18.128
And one of us said,
I don't remember which,

38:18.296 --> 38:19.963
"Are we going to the same party?"

38:20.131 --> 38:21.339
My fate was sealed.

38:22.049 --> 38:24.718
He didn't leave my side
the whole night.

38:24.885 --> 38:26.303
And he drove me home,

38:26.971 --> 38:29.180
and it turned out we had
a lot in common.

38:29.348 --> 38:32.350
We were both from the Bronx,
my mother was born in Russia.

38:32.518 --> 38:35.478
So my sister's friend,
her parents in Vienna

38:35.646 --> 38:38.648
had sent her and her brothers
to New York during the war.

38:38.816 --> 38:40.900
But when I was over there
visiting, they had

38:41.068 --> 38:43.987
just reclaimed their factory,
and it was a coat factory,

38:44.155 --> 38:45.613
and that's where I got this.

38:45.781 --> 38:50.869
So, you're a well-travelled
American girl, born in Switzerland,

38:51.704 --> 38:55.290
who took dance lessons in Paris
and is wearing a Viennese coat?

38:58.044 --> 38:59.586
Why haven't we met before?

38:59.837 --> 39:03.506
Stanley, why do you feel
compelled to dwell on

39:03.674 --> 39:06.259
the negative aspects of obedience?

39:06.802 --> 39:09.929
Why must you focus on
its destructive potential?

39:10.097 --> 39:13.058
Obedience isn't necessarily
an instrument of evil.

39:13.225 --> 39:16.144
I think we can both agree,
looking at recent history,

39:16.312 --> 39:17.896
the history that brought you
to this country,

39:18.064 --> 39:21.232
a history in which
we see abusive power

39:21.400 --> 39:24.527
assuming unprecedented
murderous dimensions.

39:25.029 --> 39:28.031
Why does your experiment give me
a dirty feeling?

39:28.866 --> 39:30.950
He didn't expect these results.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.328
He tried to change
the conditions

39:33.496 --> 39:35.872
so that people
would refuse to obey.

39:36.332 --> 39:37.540
Ah.

39:37.708 --> 39:41.628
We met in a library.
Oh, him, not him.

39:42.338 --> 39:45.465
The whole time...
I'm sorry, this is startling.

39:45.883 --> 39:50.261
Out of 780 subjects,
not a single person got up,

39:50.429 --> 39:52.055
went to the door and looked in

39:52.223 --> 39:54.307
to see if the man screaming
was all right.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.435
Not a single one.

40:02.441 --> 40:04.776
Sasha goes back
to school, Smith College,

40:04.944 --> 40:06.486
for her degree in social work.

40:08.406 --> 40:11.282
My first obedience paper
submitted almost two years ago

40:11.450 --> 40:13.785
to the Journal of Abnormal
and Social Psychology

40:13.953 --> 40:16.955
is finally published
in October 1963,

40:17.164 --> 40:19.749
just after I start
a new job at Harvard,

40:19.959 --> 40:22.794
Assistant Professor,
Department of Social Relations.

40:23.629 --> 40:26.464
Am I impressed with myself
being at Harvard?

40:26.632 --> 40:30.885
Well, I got my PhD here,
Harvard is the best place to be.

40:32.638 --> 40:36.141
The subjects were seen to swear,
tremble, stutter,

40:36.308 --> 40:39.978
bite their lips, dig their
fingernails into the flesh,

40:40.438 --> 40:44.065
and these were characteristic
responses, not exceptions,

40:44.233 --> 40:48.403
and yet, despite this behavior,
the majority complied.

40:50.364 --> 40:51.531
Yes?

40:51.991 --> 40:53.741
How do you justify
the deception?

40:55.786 --> 40:58.538
I like to think of it as illusion,
not deception.

40:58.747 --> 41:01.416
Semantics, you may say,
but illusion, you know,

41:01.584 --> 41:03.835
has a revelatory function,
as in a play.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.296
Illusion can set the stage
for revelation,

41:06.464 --> 41:09.007
to reveal certain
difficult-to-get-at truths.

41:09.175 --> 41:12.093
But still, when you go to see
a play, you pay for a ticket.

41:12.261 --> 41:13.803
You know you're seeing a play.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.222
These people didn't know
it wasn't real.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.267
You tricked them.

41:19.435 --> 41:22.270
Hello, today we'll be
doing an experiment about

41:22.438 --> 41:24.647
blind obedience
to malevolent authority.

41:24.815 --> 41:27.484
I'd like for you to pretend
that this machine is delivering

41:27.651 --> 41:29.819
painful shocks to a person in
the other room.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.946
How truthful do you think
that would be?

41:32.114 --> 41:36.075
But if you think of it, really,
you were delivering shocks

41:36.243 --> 41:39.454
to your subjects.
Psychological shocks.

41:39.622 --> 41:41.206
- And the anxieties...
- No...

41:41.373 --> 41:42.957
...methodically, for one year.

41:43.125 --> 41:45.627
If your facts were
as solid as your imagination,

41:45.794 --> 41:48.046
you'd realize that this is
a false analogy.

41:48.214 --> 41:53.176
As Kierkegaard says,
"Take away paradox from the thinker

41:53.344 --> 41:56.054
- and you have a professor."
- An assistant professor.

41:56.222 --> 41:58.473
For the moment,
Dr. Milgram and myself

41:58.682 --> 42:00.808
are only assistant professors,
it's true.

42:00.976 --> 42:03.561
The gentleman
in the elevator now

42:03.729 --> 42:05.605
is a Candid star.

42:05.773 --> 42:08.316
These folks who are entering,
the man with the white shirt,

42:08.484 --> 42:10.068
the lady with the trench coat,

42:10.819 --> 42:14.113
and, subsequently,
one other member of our staff,

42:14.281 --> 42:16.574
will face the rear.

42:16.742 --> 42:20.578
And you'll see how this man in
the trench coat...

42:26.877 --> 42:29.712
...tries to maintain his
individuality,

42:32.007 --> 42:33.466
but, little by little...

42:40.391 --> 42:43.518
...he looks at his watch but
he's really making an excuse

42:43.769 --> 42:46.646
for turning just a little bit
more to the wall."

42:46.814 --> 42:48.523
Actually, it's true.

42:48.691 --> 42:51.568
There's an element of illusion
in almost all my work.

42:52.111 --> 42:54.279
This man has apparently

42:54.488 --> 42:55.780
been in groups before.

43:06.250 --> 43:09.127
Candid Camera was a reference point,
I never deny that.

43:09.295 --> 43:11.713
You can see that plainly enough
in the lost letter technique,

43:11.880 --> 43:14.132
which I conceived of at Yale and
was refined at Harvard.

43:15.092 --> 43:17.343
Leave a letter, a sealed,
stamped letter

43:17.511 --> 43:19.762
but un-mailed,
for someone else to find.

43:19.930 --> 43:22.765
Leave it on a sidewalk,
inside a store, a phone booth.

43:22.933 --> 43:24.559
Put it under the windshield
wipers of a parked car

43:24.727 --> 43:27.228
with a note saying,
"Found near car."

43:28.063 --> 43:31.107
All letters are addressed to
the same post office box.

43:31.275 --> 43:33.151
But they're evenly split between

43:33.319 --> 43:35.403
four different
intended recipients.

43:35.571 --> 43:38.656
Friends of the Communist Party,
friends of the Nazi Party,

43:38.824 --> 43:42.744
Medical Research Associates,
and Mr. Walter Carnap.

43:42.911 --> 43:44.329
All fictitious.

43:45.331 --> 43:47.373
The innocuous content of
the letters,

43:47.541 --> 43:50.001
if anyone's curious enough
to open and read,

43:50.169 --> 43:52.503
was a simple message
from "Max" to "Walter"

43:52.671 --> 43:54.172
proposing an upcoming meeting.

43:58.260 --> 44:02.055
Carnap.
It's kind of an odd name.

44:02.973 --> 44:04.390
Like the philosopher?

44:09.563 --> 44:10.563
In two weeks,

44:10.773 --> 44:12.607
out of 100 lost letters
to each addressee,

44:12.816 --> 44:15.610
72 were sent to the Medical
Research Associates,

44:15.778 --> 44:18.154
whilst 71 were sent to
Mr. Walter Carnap,

44:19.114 --> 44:21.866
but a mere 25 to
the Friends of the Communists,

44:22.034 --> 44:24.911
and the same number, 25,
to the Nazis.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.664
We can deduce from this
that the American public

44:27.831 --> 44:29.916
has an aversion
to Nazis and Communists.

44:30.084 --> 44:33.336
Results that are reasonable
and even comforting,

44:33.504 --> 44:37.131
though not startling.
But why not take it further?

44:37.299 --> 44:38.966
Taketo Murata, another student,

44:39.134 --> 44:41.511
drives to Charlotte and
Raleigh, North Carolina,

44:41.720 --> 44:43.179
to lose a new batch of letters.

44:56.068 --> 44:58.319
When the letters come back,
the percentages, once again,

44:58.487 --> 45:00.697
confirm expected prejudices.

45:00.864 --> 45:03.282
Pro-white letters get mailed
more often

45:03.450 --> 45:05.118
in white neighborhoods.

45:05.285 --> 45:08.746
More pro-negro letters get
mailed from black neighborhoods.

45:11.417 --> 45:12.875
A variation.

45:13.043 --> 45:16.295
I hire a pilot with
a Piper Cub to fly low

45:16.463 --> 45:18.339
over Worcester, Massachusetts,

45:18.507 --> 45:20.133
spilling lost letters.

45:20.300 --> 45:23.052
They land in trees, ponds,
on rooftops.

45:23.220 --> 45:25.722
Not all my ideas are brilliant.

45:38.694 --> 45:42.989
Well, it's not on the front page,
strangely enough.

45:54.835 --> 45:56.294
I found it. Page ten.

45:59.590 --> 46:01.507
Okay. Uh...

46:02.009 --> 46:05.553
"Yale experiment shows
many distraught over cruelty

46:05.721 --> 46:06.929
but did not stop."

46:07.097 --> 46:09.390
It's odd to see one's name
in the paper,

46:09.558 --> 46:11.350
but maybe I can get used to it.

46:11.518 --> 46:12.727
"Subjects have been studied

46:12.895 --> 46:15.855
under 24 different experimental
conditions."

46:16.023 --> 46:17.648
It wasn't a thousand, was it?

46:18.108 --> 46:19.859
I talked to him for
over half an hour

46:20.027 --> 46:21.819
and I don't see
a single direct quote.

46:22.196 --> 46:26.365
"Dr. Milgram pointed out that,
'From 1933 to 1945,

46:26.533 --> 46:28.409
millions of persons

46:28.577 --> 46:31.704
were systematically slaughtered
on command.

46:32.539 --> 46:35.541
Gas chambers were built,
death camps were guarded,

46:35.709 --> 46:39.337
corpses were produced
with the same efficiency

46:39.505 --> 46:42.673
as the manufacture of appliances."'

46:42.841 --> 46:44.467
There's a quote.

46:46.929 --> 46:48.569
Do you think anyone else reads
this paper?

47:03.779 --> 47:05.363
President Kennedy has been shot.

47:05.864 --> 47:07.532
He was shot in the motorcade
in Dallas.

47:09.701 --> 47:11.118
He was shot in the head.

47:11.829 --> 47:14.831
It's Milgram. It's just another
one of his experiments.

47:14.998 --> 47:16.499
- On the level?
- Yes.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.668
Kelly, you've got that radio,
yeah? Turn it on.

47:20.879 --> 47:23.756
...his tour
of the City of Dallas, Texas.

47:23.924 --> 47:26.133
A presidential aide,
Mario Bryan, said he had

47:26.301 --> 47:28.511
no information on whether
the President is alive..."

47:28.679 --> 47:31.305
He's rigged a faked broadcast,
like Orson Welles.

47:31.473 --> 47:32.640
I have?

47:32.808 --> 47:34.892
I wonder what the experiment's
really about?

47:35.060 --> 47:37.854
- This is real.
- ...the president is critical.

47:38.021 --> 47:40.189
Texas Governor John Connally
also was shot

47:40.357 --> 47:42.900
and has been taken to surgery
in Parkland Hospital...

48:12.014 --> 48:14.557
I got it cheap, I got it cheap
from a grad student.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.669
He gave me a deal when he realized

48:16.768 --> 48:18.288
he couldn't take it with him
to London.

48:18.478 --> 48:21.397
It's making a funny noise.
Maybe you can have a look.

48:23.108 --> 48:24.525
- Stanley...
- You love this kind of thing.

48:24.693 --> 48:26.903
The dean lives
right across the street.

48:27.070 --> 48:29.196
We just applied for
financial aid.

48:29.364 --> 48:31.616
A Jaguar, right.
What's he going to think?

48:31.783 --> 48:33.326
What...
Who cares what he thinks?

48:33.493 --> 48:34.660
I didn't say that.

48:35.829 --> 48:37.914
- Well...
- I didn't say that.

48:40.208 --> 48:41.500
Yeah.

48:42.085 --> 48:43.377
See you soon.

48:51.428 --> 48:52.803
It was cheaper than you think,

48:52.971 --> 48:54.891
but I understand it creates
the wrong impression.

48:55.057 --> 48:56.265
- Do you?
- I do.

48:56.433 --> 48:58.476
Or are you just doing an imitation of

48:58.644 --> 49:01.187
someone who listens,
who's reasonable?

49:01.396 --> 49:03.064
Well, we're going to need two cars.

49:03.565 --> 49:04.607
Hmm.

49:04.775 --> 49:06.525
Is that the dean?

49:08.946 --> 49:11.948
Well, maybe it'll impress
the Harvard tenure committee.

49:12.115 --> 49:13.407
Who cares what they think?

49:17.913 --> 49:20.456
- So you returned the car?
- I did.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.334
- It was sensible.
- Hmm.

49:23.710 --> 49:26.337
I don't know a single tenured
professor who drives a Jaguar.

49:27.506 --> 49:28.965
I didn't like the color.

49:29.883 --> 49:32.927
If you get turned down it won't
be because of an automobile.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.514
But it's got to sting, yeah?

49:37.224 --> 49:40.017
The attacks, the criticisms,
the violent reactions.

49:40.894 --> 49:43.729
That woman was going through
a divorce, it turns out.

49:43.897 --> 49:45.064
I didn't take it personally.

49:47.442 --> 49:49.193
I'm going through a divorce.

49:50.737 --> 49:52.154
I don't spit at people.

49:56.702 --> 49:57.994
I'm sorry to hear that.

50:00.414 --> 50:01.497
Thank you.

50:15.345 --> 50:18.180
It's true that I am, possibly,
more than commonly on edge,

50:18.348 --> 50:20.933
but how would you feel if you
picked up a copy of

50:21.101 --> 50:23.269
American Psychologist
and found yourself attacked in

50:23.437 --> 50:27.648
an article called
"Some Thoughts on Ethics in Research:

50:27.816 --> 50:31.110
a Response to Milgram's
Behavioral Study of Obedience"?

50:31.278 --> 50:34.822
Psychiatrists,
many of you in this room,

50:34.990 --> 50:37.491
predicted that only one person
in a thousand

50:37.659 --> 50:39.035
would deliver the shocks across
the board,

50:39.202 --> 50:43.122
an estimate that was off by
a factor of 500.

50:43.290 --> 50:48.294
So what happened in the lab was
discovered, not planned.

50:48.920 --> 50:53.299
But you expected, you knew you
were going to worry some people.

50:53.467 --> 50:54.675
- Mmm.
- Stress, in fact,

50:54.843 --> 50:56.677
- was a part of it.
- Well, every...

50:56.845 --> 50:57.887
Extreme stress.

50:58.055 --> 51:01.223
Every experiment is a situation
where the end is unknown,

51:01.391 --> 51:05.394
indeterminate,
something that might fail.

51:05.562 --> 51:08.147
The indeterminacy is part of
the excitement.

51:08.315 --> 51:10.775
Ethics. The undertow of ethics.

51:10.942 --> 51:16.489
I wanted to ask a question,
a series of questions

51:16.698 --> 51:19.325
about the psychological function
of obedience.

51:19.493 --> 51:22.995
The conditions that shape it,
the defense mechanisms it entails.

51:24.164 --> 51:28.084
The emotional forces
that keep a person obeying.

51:28.251 --> 51:31.128
As someone with pretensions as
a moral educator,

51:31.296 --> 51:35.549
let me suggest that science must
enhance our moral personhood,

51:35.717 --> 51:37.218
not... not diminish it.

51:38.678 --> 51:41.347
You forced people
to torture other people.

51:41.515 --> 51:42.932
- No.
- To see if they...

51:43.100 --> 51:46.894
No. No. No.
That is alien to my view.

51:47.479 --> 51:50.731
No one was forced, right?

51:50.899 --> 51:53.692
The experimenter told the
subject to perform an action.

51:53.860 --> 51:57.363
What happened between
the command and the outcome

51:57.531 --> 51:59.073
is the individual.

51:59.658 --> 52:04.745
With conscience and a will,
who can either obey or disobey.

52:04.913 --> 52:09.208
I don't see how you can
seriously equate victimization

52:09.376 --> 52:12.837
in a laboratory con
with the willful participation

52:13.004 --> 52:14.255
in mass murder.

52:14.422 --> 52:16.549
Victimization? Look...

52:18.802 --> 52:20.553
When the experiments were complete...

52:21.763 --> 52:26.225
all the subjects were sent this
questionnaire. Here's some examples.

52:30.272 --> 52:33.899
Eighty-four percent said they were
glad to have been in the experiment.

52:34.067 --> 52:37.069
Fifteen percent
indicated neutral feelings.

52:37.237 --> 52:41.323
One point three percent
indicated negative feelings.

52:42.325 --> 52:43.993
One point three percent.

52:44.536 --> 52:47.371
Four-fifths thought more
experiments of this sort

52:47.539 --> 52:51.208
should be carried out,
and 74 percent said they had

52:51.376 --> 52:55.171
learned something of personal
importance about themselves

52:55.338 --> 52:58.549
and about the conditions
that shape human action.

53:02.387 --> 53:05.764
A year after the study,
a psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Errara,

53:05.932 --> 53:08.092
was hired to meet with subjects
who might have suffered

53:08.185 --> 53:09.685
possible negative effects.

53:10.979 --> 53:13.814
This is not another experiment.
There's no trick here.

53:14.524 --> 53:16.692
I can see why you may have
your doubts.

53:16.860 --> 53:17.985
- Yes.
- Yes.

53:18.612 --> 53:20.196
This is a debriefing meeting.

53:20.363 --> 53:23.324
We're here to assess
the after-effects.

53:23.491 --> 53:26.327
So, tell us how you feel.

53:27.621 --> 53:30.623
I'd like to know
what the point is of it.

53:32.125 --> 53:34.335
To learn something about
human nature.

53:34.502 --> 53:35.711
That was the aim.

53:37.172 --> 53:38.464
Professor Milgram?

53:40.217 --> 53:44.386
I hope that... I sincerely hope that,
basically,

53:44.554 --> 53:46.835
you don't have the feeling that
would rather not have been

53:46.973 --> 53:48.641
a part of this experiment.

53:51.311 --> 53:53.270
It's an interesting life experience.

53:54.147 --> 53:55.648
I don't like hurting anyone

53:56.024 --> 53:58.776
and I can't understand myself
going all the way.

53:59.694 --> 54:01.737
- It left me feeling guilty.
- Mm-hm.

54:01.947 --> 54:03.530
Weren't we supposed
to have coffee?

54:03.949 --> 54:05.032
Yeah.

54:05.200 --> 54:08.535
I told my husband.
I know I wasn't supposed to.

54:08.703 --> 54:11.080
But I don't do everything I'm told.

54:11.248 --> 54:14.166
He said he wouldn't have done
the shocks, he would have refused.

54:16.253 --> 54:19.296
I wanted to cry,
but I started to laugh.

54:19.464 --> 54:22.633
- I think I did both.
- I was quite frightened,

54:22.801 --> 54:25.386
and I was quivering, and it's...

54:25.553 --> 54:28.597
I actually tried to memorize
the word pairs myself

54:28.765 --> 54:30.140
so that if they
switched it around

54:30.308 --> 54:31.767
I wouldn't have to get
those shocks.

54:32.269 --> 54:35.312
There's a tendency to think that
everything a person does

54:35.480 --> 54:38.816
is due to the feelings or ideas
within the person.

54:40.318 --> 54:42.194
You haven't had your coffee.
You want coffee?

54:42.362 --> 54:44.989
- Yes.
- Cream? Sugar?

54:45.156 --> 54:47.449
- I'll take two sugars.
- Both, please.

54:47.617 --> 54:48.826
Yes, thank you.

54:49.828 --> 54:54.039
But sometimes a person's actions
depend equally

54:54.207 --> 54:56.166
on the situation
you find yourself in.

54:56.334 --> 54:59.461
And in this case, the power of
the situation overwhelmed

54:59.629 --> 55:01.380
your personal power.

55:01.715 --> 55:03.465
I'm an understanding person.

55:04.217 --> 55:05.342
Okay?

55:05.510 --> 55:09.596
I'm an intelligent human being.
Speak the truth to me...

55:11.725 --> 55:14.935
and I'll cooperate gladly,
even if it's a bitter truth,

55:15.103 --> 55:16.520
but don't lie to me.

55:17.981 --> 55:21.233
The purpose was
to advance science,

55:22.027 --> 55:23.360
learn something.

55:24.237 --> 55:27.865
Maybe you shouldn't do this kind
of experiment if you have to deceive.

55:30.076 --> 55:32.745
Look, you can deceive other
people but don't deceive me.

55:36.833 --> 55:38.959
We had half a dozen sessions
with Errara

55:39.127 --> 55:41.920
and invited subjects.
The meetings were sparsely attended,

55:42.130 --> 55:44.965
full of confusion and complaints,
but we concluded

55:45.133 --> 55:47.176
that no one showed signs of harm,

55:47.344 --> 55:48.886
no one had been traumatized.

55:49.804 --> 55:52.389
- Stanley?
- Tom Shannon.

55:54.809 --> 55:56.602
Tom did the wiring on
the shock generator.

55:56.770 --> 55:59.396
- At Yale. The shock box.
- It's nice to meet you.

55:59.564 --> 56:01.774
- This is Sasha.
- This is Michele.

56:01.941 --> 56:05.027
Hey, I hated hearing about
Jim McDonough. Dead at 49.

56:05.195 --> 56:06.987
That stuff about his heart
was no joke.

56:07.155 --> 56:11.116
Yeah, I know. Sat down to a bowl
of oatmeal and... had a heart attack.

56:15.038 --> 56:16.538
He had nine kids.

56:16.706 --> 56:20.376
Oh, sad. Maybe you shouldn't
unload such a large brood

56:20.543 --> 56:22.503
into the world, no offense.

56:22.670 --> 56:25.756
She's taking us to Paris.
It's the first stamp on her passport.

56:26.132 --> 56:28.509
- That's awesome.
- Sasha thinks I need a vacation.

56:28.676 --> 56:30.677
Yeah. I heard they roughed you
up pretty good

56:30.845 --> 56:33.639
- about those results.
- He's up for tenure.

56:33.807 --> 56:35.287
People get feisty,
but it'll work out.

56:35.350 --> 56:38.310
Gotta finish your book now.
Publish or perish, right?

56:38.478 --> 56:42.314
Actually, I got sidetracked
working on The Small World Problem.

56:44.067 --> 56:47.361
For The Small World Problem,
we asked people in Kansas and Omaha

56:47.529 --> 56:51.240
to mail a packet to a person in
Sharon, Massachusetts.

56:53.493 --> 56:54.743
The instructions are simple.

56:57.163 --> 56:58.455
There's a target person.

56:58.623 --> 57:01.375
In this case, a stockbroker
named Jacobs in Sharon, Mass.

57:02.001 --> 57:04.253
Assuming they don't know them,
people are asked to mail

57:04.421 --> 57:06.422
the folder to someone who might
know him.

57:06.673 --> 57:09.716
They can send it to a friend,
relative, or acquaintance,

57:09.884 --> 57:12.803
but they have to send it,
and this is key, to a person

57:12.971 --> 57:16.515
they know on a first-name basis.
There's a roster to fill out

57:16.683 --> 57:20.018
and a batch of postcards to mail
back to Harvard to track the process.

57:21.396 --> 57:23.272
Will it work? We don't know.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.150
A woman in Omaha sends the
folder to a high school friend,

57:26.359 --> 57:28.277
a bank clerk, in Council Bluffs,
Iowa.

57:28.445 --> 57:31.613
She sends it to a man in Belmont,
Massachusetts, a publisher,

57:31.781 --> 57:34.533
who sends it to a tanner in
Sharon, the tanner sends it

57:34.701 --> 57:37.953
to his brother-in-law, a sheet
metal worker, also in Sharon,

57:38.121 --> 57:41.206
who sends it to a dentist,
who sends it to a printer,

57:41.374 --> 57:43.709
who sends it to Mr. Jacobs.

57:43.877 --> 57:45.419
Seven links in the chain.

57:48.465 --> 57:51.133
The average chain, in fact,
involves 5.5 links.

57:51.301 --> 57:54.344
That is, we determine that less
than six degrees of separation

57:54.512 --> 57:57.347
exist between you
and several million strangers

57:57.515 --> 57:59.766
who you may or may not encounter
in your lifetime.

58:01.686 --> 58:04.855
When we understand the structure
of this communication net,

58:05.023 --> 58:08.859
we stand to grasp a good deal
more about the fabric of society.

58:09.903 --> 58:14.281
Maybe it's not necessarily justified,
this common human complaint.

58:14.449 --> 58:18.243
The feeling that we're all
cut off, alienated, and alone.

58:20.538 --> 58:23.957
I don't need to go into detail do I?
The things I remember,

58:24.125 --> 58:25.876
when I was 16, in Bucharest.

58:26.586 --> 58:29.171
The killings, torture, terror.

58:29.422 --> 58:32.090
- Why are you bringing this up now?
- It's relevant.

58:32.467 --> 58:35.844
The man was just turned down
for tenure at Harvard.

58:36.638 --> 58:38.972
You wish to give the tragedy
some perspective.

58:39.140 --> 58:42.017
It's not just that.
Because, bear with me,

58:42.185 --> 58:44.394
they took people to the
slaughterhouse and strung them

58:44.562 --> 58:49.024
on meat hooks, still alive.
Cut open their bellies like cattle.

58:49.192 --> 58:50.651
A five-year-old boy.

58:51.402 --> 58:55.322
And they watched the entrails
spill out, the blood drain,

58:55.490 --> 58:59.535
and they wrote notes and they
pinned the papers to the bodies.

59:00.161 --> 59:01.578
"Kosher."

59:26.896 --> 59:28.647
Serge was just giving me
a lesson in...

59:28.815 --> 59:29.940
Reality?

59:30.108 --> 59:33.527
The pogroms,
in Romania during the war.

59:35.154 --> 59:36.613
The Iron Guard...

59:37.949 --> 59:41.493
they lit people on fire,
threw them off buildings.

59:43.663 --> 59:46.707
This is my charming way of
saying your husband's work

59:46.874 --> 59:48.667
is very important...

59:49.335 --> 59:50.586
and timely.

59:51.296 --> 59:54.464
Because the techniques change,
the victims change,

59:55.216 --> 59:58.594
but it's still a question.
How do these things happen?

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.222
How are they institutionalized?

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:09.396
The Algerian War, the tortures.
Do you know about this in the States?

01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:11.064
Yeah, of course.

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:15.277
You should do the obedience
experiments in Europe, Stanley.

01:00:15.987 --> 01:00:19.573
France, Germany.
Recreate them.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.200
Will it be different?

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:26.038
- I don't think so.
- Who would fund them?

01:00:27.206 --> 01:00:30.208
The experiments are unethical.
Remember?

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:33.670
No tenure, no funding.

01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:37.341
And the IRBs? The IRBs, yes?

01:00:37.508 --> 01:00:40.385
Basically you cannot do these
experiments without submitting

01:00:40.553 --> 01:00:42.429
something to
the Internal Review Board.

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:46.058
He'll finish his book, and then
Stanley wants to move on

01:00:46.225 --> 01:00:48.852
from the obedience experiments,
and why not?

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:54.232
Well, you look under a rock,
ugly things crawl out,

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:56.068
and we have to face them.

01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:03.659
Your other experiments,
the letters, the maps,

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:06.370
clever, hopeful,

01:01:06.537 --> 01:01:10.666
but you have to get back to
the obedience experiments.

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:15.545
- I do? I have to?
- Yes, Stanley. You have no choice.

01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:26.723
My new job at
City University of New York

01:01:26.891 --> 01:01:29.893
involves a jump in pay
and full professorship.

01:01:30.561 --> 01:01:32.813
Head of the department of
social psychology.

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.441
The City of New York is
a major laboratory,

01:01:36.984 --> 01:01:39.569
to be utilized in the research and
training of graduate students

01:01:39.737 --> 01:01:41.279
in social psychology.

01:01:41.614 --> 01:01:43.281
That's from the CUNY brochure.

01:01:44.534 --> 01:01:45.617
I wrote it.

01:01:48.913 --> 01:01:51.415
Sasha finds an apartment for us
in Riverdale

01:01:51.582 --> 01:01:55.669
with a great view of the Hudson.
Marc was born in 1967.

01:01:55.837 --> 01:01:57.754
He hardly remembers Cambridge.

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:02.217
Even, or especially when nothing
decisive is happening,

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:05.220
time refuses to stand still.

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:13.812
I walk to the station every morning,
take the train into the city.

01:02:14.021 --> 01:02:16.565
I enjoy the routine.

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:23.530
Today's assignment.
Get on a local bus,

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:26.450
and then with the bus in motion
and loud enough

01:02:26.617 --> 01:02:28.744
to be heard by your fellow
passengers,

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:30.370
sing your favorite song.

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:34.374
Any song we want?

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:38.128
Just as long as you know the
words and can sing them loud

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:42.215
and clear. Pair up. Non-singer
takes notes, then switch roles.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:49.306
You may say, "So what? Singing
a song, anyone can do that."

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:52.809
Or, "I don't have to do that,
I'm an individual, not a conformist."

01:02:52.977 --> 01:02:56.688
Or, "This is silly, it doesn't change
the world to sing a song."

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:03.695
get on the bus and sing.

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.699
Now go, right now. Come on.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:13.997
No humming.

01:03:25.593 --> 01:03:28.637
My next guest is
professor of psychology

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:31.973
at the Graduate Center,
the City University in New York.

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:35.769
He's written a fascinating book,
a disturbing book.

01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:39.397
An Experimental View,

01:03:39.565 --> 01:03:41.566
just published by Harper & Row.

01:03:41.734 --> 01:03:46.488
Please welcome a very creative,
very controversial

01:03:46.697 --> 01:03:49.741
socio-psychologist,
Stanley Milgram.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:51.326
Doctor. Dr. Milgram.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:55.997
So your subjects, they thought
the shocks were real,

01:03:56.165 --> 01:03:59.876
that they were
delivering 450 volts,

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:01.878
- Sixty five percent of them.
- Mm.

01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:06.091
But they were not particularly
aggressive or sadistic people.

01:04:06.259 --> 01:04:08.927
They were a representative
cross-section of the average

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:12.013
American citizen living within
range of Yale University.

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:15.392
I thought, yes, we'd do
the experiment in New Haven,

01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:18.311
and there'd be very limited
obedience,

01:04:18.479 --> 01:04:21.314
and then we'd recreate
the experiment in, say, Berlin,

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:24.526
and find the rate of obedience
to be much higher.

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:27.654
Saved a bit on airfare,
didn't you?

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.449
So, let me get this straight.

01:04:32.076 --> 01:04:34.619
You did the experiment
in the early '60s?

01:04:35.329 --> 01:04:40.542
And here we are, 1974,
and your book still feels like news.

01:04:41.335 --> 01:04:42.711
Why is that?

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.923
People don't have the resources
to resist authority.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:49.175
That's what the experiment
teaches us.

01:04:49.343 --> 01:04:51.887
But people don't wanna hear it.
The experiment explains

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:56.808
a kind of...
flaw in social thinking,

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:59.853
a deadening,
a suspension of moral value.

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:01.980
What would you
say to your critics,

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:05.942
critics who would insist
the moral lapse is yours?

01:05:06.527 --> 01:05:11.031
One of them cites "the extremely
callous, deceitful way

01:05:11.198 --> 01:05:12.949
the experiments were carried out."

01:05:13.117 --> 01:05:16.494
Another calls them
"morally repugnant, vile."

01:05:18.456 --> 01:05:20.749
"Milgram belongs on the
other end of the shock machine."

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:26.004
There certainly is a certain
kind of Kafkaesque quality

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.923
- to the experiments.
- Kafkaesque?

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:30.216
The experiment taught me
something about the, uh,

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.636
plasticity of human nature.

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:38.224
Not the evil, not the aggressiveness,
but a certain kind of malleability.

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:41.478
Sixty-five percent of volunteers
were obedient.

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:45.941
That left 35 percent who
recognized a moral breach,

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:49.194
took responsibility for
their actions and resisted.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.529
There is no permanent tissue damage.

01:05:51.697 --> 01:05:54.532
That's your opinion.
If he doesn't want to continue,

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.242
I'm taking orders from him.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:06:00.246
The experiment requires you continue.
You have no other choice.

01:06:00.414 --> 01:06:03.249
If this were Russia maybe,
but not in America.

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:07.420
But obedience,
compliance, was more common.

01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:12.759
You tell yourself, "I wouldn't
do that. I'd never do that."

01:06:13.552 --> 01:06:15.553
But then, what did Montaigne
say?

01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:21.476
"We are double in ourselves.
What we believe we disbelieve,

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:24.813
and we cannot rid ourselves of
what we condemn."

01:06:40.746 --> 01:06:44.833
Another one of my experiments.
Hank, a CUNY grad student,

01:06:45.001 --> 01:06:48.044
was the designated
"crowd crystal" staring up

01:06:48.212 --> 01:06:49.838
at a fixed point in space,

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:53.133
looking up at a
non-existent something.

01:06:55.011 --> 01:06:56.553
As you multiply the confederates,

01:06:56.721 --> 01:06:59.806
the people who stare up because
we've recruited them to stare up,

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:02.517
the number of people who
actually stop and look

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.227
increases exponentially.

01:07:06.063 --> 01:07:09.190
Meanwhile, Obedience to Authority
gets translated into

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:12.610
eight languages and nominated
for a national book award.

01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:20.535
October 24th, 1974, 4:25pm.

01:07:20.911 --> 01:07:24.122
Sheila Jarcho, J-A-R...

01:07:24.290 --> 01:07:25.749
I know how to spell it,
Stanley.

01:07:25.916 --> 01:07:29.836
...C-H-O, working on the mental
maps project, comes in

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:33.048
and tells me errors were made in
the neighborhood map,

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.759
already duplicated in some
500 copies.

01:07:36.927 --> 01:07:40.013
Her facial expression captures
the attitude that she's shown

01:07:40.181 --> 01:07:42.599
all along in her capacity as
research assistant.

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:44.851
Are my eyes
really that close together?

01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:48.104
On the whole, both men and women
are highly critical

01:07:48.272 --> 01:07:49.939
when studying photographs of
themselves.

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.025
The vanity factor's
extraordinary

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:53.735
when people judge
their own image.

01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:55.904
Do you ever worry that
everything's sort of

01:07:56.113 --> 01:07:58.990
an anti-climax since
the obedience experiments,

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:02.827
and that your work,
really everything you're doing,

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:04.704
is just a flash in the pan?

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:10.668
The truth is, you're invested in
the idea of authority

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:13.254
and you love lording it over
all of us.

01:08:13.464 --> 01:08:15.965
Me, the other students,
and even your wife.

01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:18.259
- Me?
- Well, fuck yeah.

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:23.348
I work here because I get paid for it

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:25.642
and I actually think
it's kind of fun.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:28.895
Sheila, what's wrong with you?

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:32.357
Huh. Just keep doing
what he tells you to do.

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:37.319
I don't get along
with all my students.

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.404
The flash in the pan?

01:08:40.157 --> 01:08:42.367
How many people can manage
even that flash?

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:45.203
I've done some psych
experiments,

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:48.456
but in my mind I'm still about
to write my great Broadway musical.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:53.795
4:27 pm. Paul Hollander,
looking tan and fit,

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:55.630
pays a visit from Massachusetts.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:58.341
Tan and fit and miserable.

01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:00.260
I am so sorry, Paul.

01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:02.554
Well, another marriage
down the drain.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.057
- I should've seen it coming.
- It's terrible, rotten.

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:07.934
But you look good.

01:09:08.102 --> 01:09:09.902
The worst of it is she's
erected a Berlin Wall

01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:11.604
- between me and my daughter.
- Oh.

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:17.569
- Nice place you've got here.
- It isn't Harvard, but, thank you.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.696
Harvard would never have given
you an office half as grand

01:09:19.863 --> 01:09:23.366
as this, or found you
as bewitching a secretary.

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:25.743
Oh. Well, I just go
where the work is.

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:29.413
So, aren't you
going to take my picture, then?

01:09:31.082 --> 01:09:32.292
I'm considering it.

01:09:41.385 --> 01:09:44.345
Do you ever feel invincible one
moment and then worthless the next?

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.934
Yes and no.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:01.696
The camera begins to attract
its own subject matter.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.448
It's no longer a passive recorder

01:10:04.533 --> 01:10:07.368
but actively attracts
the people it records.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:14.292
Uh, Stanley Milgram?

01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:18.171
How did I get to be so old?

01:10:19.423 --> 01:10:21.216
What is the Kierkegaard quote?

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:25.511
"Life can always be...

01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:27.722
Only be understood backward."

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.558
October 24th, 1974, 4:29 pm.

01:10:30.809 --> 01:10:33.728
Conversation with Paul Hollander
interrupted by the arrival of

01:10:33.896 --> 01:10:36.856
a messenger bearing, at last,

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:39.734
the German edition of
Obedience to Authority.

01:10:40.861 --> 01:10:42.528
With crass barbed wire
cover design.

01:10:42.696 --> 01:10:43.988
Mein Gott.

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:47.867
- What's your name?
- Thomas Shine.

01:10:48.035 --> 01:10:49.744
Mind participating in
my experiment?

01:10:50.996 --> 01:10:51.996
It depends.

01:10:52.164 --> 01:10:54.582
He just wants to take your picture.
Everybody's doing it.

01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:59.671
- Okay. I need a signature.
- Oh, yes.

01:11:01.006 --> 01:11:03.466
He's interested in
the unacknowledged power

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:04.968
of photographic images.

01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:08.388
Okay.

01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:12.684
"Life can only be understood
backwards,

01:11:13.185 --> 01:11:15.603
but has to be lived forwards."

01:11:28.909 --> 01:11:31.619
Around this time,
I was also working on

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.538
The Familiar Stranger.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:39.377
We take photographs of commuters
on a train platform.

01:11:39.545 --> 01:11:42.213
Each figure in the photographs
are given a number.

01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:44.048
The photos are duplicated,

01:11:44.216 --> 01:11:46.259
and a week later
the students follow up.

01:11:48.345 --> 01:11:50.430
Hello. I'm a student at CUNY.

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:52.397
Would you mind filling out
this questionnaire?

01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:54.434
- Okay.
- Also,

01:11:54.601 --> 01:11:56.185
do you recognize
any of these people?

01:11:56.645 --> 01:11:57.895
No.

01:11:58.272 --> 01:12:00.773
- What about here?
- Well, that's me.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.443
Yes.
Can you identify anyone else?

01:12:03.610 --> 01:12:05.028
Not by name.

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:09.741
Most commuters recognize,
on average, four individuals

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:12.577
that they see in their daily routine
but never speak to.

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:14.162
Familiar strangers.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:17.040
Amongst these are
"sociometric stars".

01:12:17.207 --> 01:12:21.127
Figures that they not only recognize
but even fantasize about.

01:12:25.966 --> 01:12:28.801
They wonder what kind of lives
these strangers lead,

01:12:28.969 --> 01:12:30.303
what their jobs are like.

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:33.181
And if they ran into each other
in another place,

01:12:33.557 --> 01:12:36.809
or if some emergency jolted them
out of this routine,

01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:40.521
they might start to speak,
actually know one another.

01:12:46.362 --> 01:12:49.655
I teach at CUNY, and I see you
out here, you know, all the time

01:12:49.823 --> 01:12:51.616
and I wonder about the things
you must see.

01:12:52.576 --> 01:12:54.577
You look familiar.
What do you teach?

01:12:54.745 --> 01:12:57.997
Social psychology. "The City of
New York is a vast laboratory."

01:12:58.165 --> 01:13:00.583
I had no idea you were English.
You're English?

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:02.877
- Yes.
- Assuming that accent is real.

01:13:03.837 --> 01:13:06.839
- I saw you on TV.
- Good Morning America.

01:13:07.007 --> 01:13:09.801
- I knew you looked familiar.
- He tortures people

01:13:09.968 --> 01:13:12.512
- with electric shocks.
- That isn't accurate.

01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:14.430
He's very controversial.

01:13:14.598 --> 01:13:16.808
Have you read my book?
Have you?

01:13:16.975 --> 01:13:19.227
I don't get a chance to read as
much as I would like to.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.312
- It's okay.
- I read the review.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.980
Well, there were many reviews.

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:26.401
It was the Times, wasn't it?
Harsh.

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:28.569
Yes, it was. It was harsh.

01:13:28.737 --> 01:13:31.572
It was nominated for an award,
but, yeah, who cares?

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.199
Why disabuse yourself?

01:13:33.951 --> 01:13:35.159
What?

01:13:35.327 --> 01:13:37.662
I don't wanna make you angry,
ma'am. Just...

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.498
have a nice day, okay?

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:43.000
Abe, it was a pleasure
meeting you.

01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:55.847
I was bowled over when I first
read about it,

01:13:56.056 --> 01:14:00.601
and you in the Times,
and then I read the original material

01:14:00.769 --> 01:14:02.895
and the scientific journals,
and I mulled.

01:14:03.063 --> 01:14:05.022
- You mulled?
- I mulled.

01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:09.235
This mulling produced the idea
to do a TV play

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:12.989
of a hopefully high caliber,
for an accepted show,

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:16.492
of a decently adult level,
treating, in fictional form,

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.287
the kind of experiments you
performed and its aftermath.

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:22.248
Using it as a springboard for
my own characters

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:25.042
and situational inventions.

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:28.129
I, uh, I kept this.

01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:31.090
D'you see how yellow?

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:35.428
Stan, sorry, help me.
I was just wondering.

01:14:35.596 --> 01:14:37.680
Your name, its derivation?

01:14:38.432 --> 01:14:40.683
Milgram means "pomegranate"
in Hebrew.

01:14:40.851 --> 01:14:43.144
It's one of the seven fruits of
the Bible. I'm Jewish,

01:14:44.104 --> 01:14:45.605
if that's what you're asking?

01:14:45.772 --> 01:14:47.398
Apples is another, right?

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:50.276
Figs, grapes.
Olives, they're a fruit?

01:14:51.069 --> 01:14:55.406
Anyhow, when you point out
the parallels, the connections,

01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:58.868
Hannah Arendt,
The Banality of Evil,

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:03.498
the My Lai massacre, all of that,
I see where you're coming from.

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:06.959
I'm here because a serious
situation is pending

01:15:07.127 --> 01:15:09.504
with regard to the drama I propose.

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:14.884
Playhouse 90, the Columbia
Broadcasting System.

01:15:15.427 --> 01:15:16.844
CBS.

01:15:32.819 --> 01:15:35.571
Michele, ma belle. Ca va?

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:37.281
Hi.

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:40.159
I was just gonna get
some ice cream.

01:16:00.764 --> 01:16:03.140
Whenever I'm up late like this,
which is a lot,

01:16:04.101 --> 01:16:05.726
I think of your grandfather.

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:08.437
- Sam?
- Yeah, that was his name.

01:16:08.605 --> 01:16:09.689
Yeah.

01:16:10.774 --> 01:16:12.066
He died.

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:16.946
That's right, in his sleep.
It's the luckiest way, people say,

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:18.447
not to know what's happening.

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:21.951
Why... Why did he die?

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.369
Hmm.

01:16:24.788 --> 01:16:26.080
Heart disease.

01:16:27.165 --> 01:16:30.835
It was before you were born,
before your mother could meet him.

01:16:32.629 --> 01:16:36.007
He was a baker,
his specialty were cakes.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:38.050
- He worked late.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:16:38.468 --> 01:16:40.308
I got it from him.
Maybe you'll get it from me.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.727
Basically there are
three types of people.

01:16:47.894 --> 01:16:50.271
That's what
your research confirms.

01:16:51.064 --> 01:16:53.441
There's the person
who makes things happen,

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.985
the person who
watches things happen,

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:58.863
then the person who says,
"What happened?"

01:16:59.906 --> 01:17:01.866
Right?

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:06.662
I'm a dramatist, I was explicit,
not a scientist.

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:11.417
Your work is a springboard for
revealing basic human truths.

01:17:12.210 --> 01:17:15.254
You get your consultant's fee.
What's the problem?

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:16.881
It isn't about the money.

01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:24.722
I'm sorry, she needs
to speak to you again.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:26.098
She says it's urgent.

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:30.269
Tell her to relax.

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:39.362
Excuse me.

01:18:19.736 --> 01:18:20.986
Dr. Stanley?

01:18:23.156 --> 01:18:24.198
Yes?

01:18:25.033 --> 01:18:27.493
Mr. Bellak won't be back
in his office this afternoon.

01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:30.121
Excuse me?

01:18:30.664 --> 01:18:32.498
He can't talk to you today anymore.

01:18:33.583 --> 01:18:35.084
He says you can visit the set.

01:18:38.463 --> 01:18:39.714
Okay.

01:18:54.938 --> 01:18:57.314
So, you sold him the rights?

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:02.611
No. But it's a gray area.

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:06.991
But it's your book, it's your work,
it's your experiments.

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:10.369
So either you did it or you sold it
or you didn't. Right?

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:13.205
In the opinion of
Harper's legal department,

01:19:13.373 --> 01:19:16.125
we don't have a supportable claim,
not on the basis of

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:19.670
copyright infringement,
because the show is fiction.

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:21.672
Are we finished with this?

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.800
They gave me a consulting fee.
Is that enough?

01:19:26.136 --> 01:19:28.763
Your father's turning into
a fictional character.

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:30.806
- Why?
- Yes, why?

01:19:30.974 --> 01:19:32.534
And why do they have
to make you a goy?

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:34.852
It's not about me.
I'm just a springboard.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:37.313
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:41.525
Oh, I see.
So, you had no choice?

01:19:41.693 --> 01:19:45.029
I could just give the money back
but they'd make the show anyway.

01:19:45.197 --> 01:19:47.364
Why don't I give the money back?

01:19:47.532 --> 01:19:49.825
I'll give the money back!
That's a good idea.

01:19:49.993 --> 01:19:52.536
You know what?
You don't have to be so snippy.

01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:05.174
They don't just come in

01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:07.510
and sadistically pull these switches.
Bing. Bing.

01:20:07.677 --> 01:20:10.554
They have an inner struggle
not to obey.

01:20:12.307 --> 01:20:14.600
Their inner pain is
the evidence to that.

01:20:14.768 --> 01:20:16.977
Steven, what you're doing
is very important,

01:20:17.187 --> 01:20:19.438
and I love the design.
It's audacious.

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:23.275
And?

01:20:23.735 --> 01:20:27.571
I am being careful, which is why
I've got tenure around here

01:20:27.739 --> 01:20:29.824
long before black
became popular.

01:20:31.117 --> 01:20:33.285
It's tricky. Very tricky.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:36.455
There'll be criticism of
anything breaking new ground.

01:20:37.624 --> 01:20:39.959
There are times when
your life resembles a bad movie,

01:20:40.126 --> 01:20:43.963
but nothing prepares you if your life
actually becomes a bad movie.

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:47.716
Here's Dr. Steven Turner,
Steven/Stanley, Turner/Milgram,

01:20:47.884 --> 01:20:51.804
of Rutledge University,
a bachelor and a WASP,

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:54.348
being played by William Shatner,

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:57.935
four years after
his last Star Trek episode.

01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:01.313
Ossie Davis plays his colleague
and best friend.

01:21:02.607 --> 01:21:05.526
I don't believe you're
adequately considering...

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:08.112
faculty reaction.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:11.532
You may find yourself teaching
in Siberia.

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:26.463
This has to be somewhat weird
for you.

01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:32.011
Well, I've made some films
myself actually.

01:21:32.178 --> 01:21:33.387
Documentaries.

01:21:33.847 --> 01:21:37.016
I think Ossie may have meant,
and I was wondering also,

01:21:37.517 --> 01:21:41.812
do you have a best friend
who is, you know, a brother?

01:21:43.273 --> 01:21:47.401
I mean this tradition of
a black best friend,

01:21:48.445 --> 01:21:49.820
where did that come from?

01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:52.281
You don't have
a black best friend, Bill?

01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:54.533
No. Do you?

01:21:55.785 --> 01:21:58.621
This character isn't me.
I'm just a springboard.

01:21:58.788 --> 01:22:02.541
Did you know I did the first
interracial kiss in US TV history?

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:05.252
Ah, Star Trek, sure.

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:09.006
I kissed Nichelle Nichols on
network TV.

01:22:09.799 --> 01:22:12.301
Controversial, but you did it.

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:15.220
The network was... nervous.

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:18.349
They insisted we shoot
an alternative version,

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:22.061
but during the close up
I did this...

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:31.153
First time, 1968,
in the history of TV.

01:22:34.824 --> 01:22:36.825
I've read about
your experiments, Doctor.

01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:42.998
Did you happen to use
any black folks?

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:44.416
Yes, of course.

01:22:47.921 --> 01:22:49.129
And the results?

01:22:49.714 --> 01:22:51.966
They fared the same as
everyone else.

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:54.551
Roughly 65 percent compliant.

01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:57.096
You didn't force or
threaten anyone, right?

01:22:57.263 --> 01:22:59.139
- No.
- You didn't twist anyone's arm?

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:02.059
- No, no.
- Didn't hold a gun to anyone's head?

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:05.437
You see, it brings to mind when
I was six or seven years old,

01:23:05.605 --> 01:23:06.897
coming home from school.

01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:10.693
Two policemen call me over
from their car.

01:23:11.528 --> 01:23:14.405
"Come over here, boy.
Come on over."

01:23:15.615 --> 01:23:17.241
- Have I heard this one?
- No.

01:23:18.743 --> 01:23:20.244
They tell me to get into the car,

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:22.079
and they take me
to the precinct station.

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:26.542
Then one of them
takes a jar of cane syrup

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:28.002
and pours it over my head.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:33.215
And they both laugh like it's
the funniest thing in the world.

01:23:33.925 --> 01:23:35.175
I laugh too.

01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:40.639
Then they give me hunks of
peanut brittle and let me go.

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:45.060
It took me 30 years
before I told anyone.

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:49.481
Where was this, Ossie?
Down South?

01:23:49.649 --> 01:23:51.734
Well, it doesn't matter where,
and that's my point.

01:23:52.736 --> 01:23:54.028
You don't have to go to Germany

01:23:54.195 --> 01:23:56.405
to learn about
obedience to authority.

01:23:56.573 --> 01:23:58.782
This in the book. Actually,
it's the tenth chapter,

01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:02.202
- which very few people get to.
- The Tenth Level.

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:06.331
The agentic state,
in which the demands of

01:24:06.499 --> 01:24:09.668
the democratically installed
authority conflict with conscience.

01:24:10.211 --> 01:24:11.628
The Banality of Evil.

01:24:15.508 --> 01:24:18.052
I don't take responsibility.
Do you take responsibility?

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:20.888
I take responsibility.
Now count that as wrong.

01:24:21.639 --> 01:24:23.057
No response counts as wrong.

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:25.704
You pull the switch then, dammit!
Come on, you pull the switch!

01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:28.020
Mr. Dahlquist, that's your job.

01:24:29.939 --> 01:24:31.398
No, I won't.

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:33.525
Nobody can learn anything
like this.

01:24:35.528 --> 01:24:37.738
There was a time, I suspect,
when men and women

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:40.616
could give a fully human
response to any situation.

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:44.286
When we could be fully absorbed
in the world as human beings.

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:46.914
But more often, now,

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:50.292
people don't get to see
the whole situation

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.127
but only some small part of it.

01:24:52.295 --> 01:24:55.547
There's a division of labor,
and people carry out small,

01:24:55.715 --> 01:24:57.633
narrow, specialized jobs,

01:24:58.301 --> 01:25:01.512
and we can't act without some
kind of direction from on high.

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:05.265
I call this "the agentic state".

01:25:06.017 --> 01:25:08.435
The individual yields to authority,

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:12.064
and in doing so becomes
alienated from his own actions.

01:25:13.441 --> 01:25:15.776
Mr. Dahlquist,
you agreed to the rules.

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:19.279
The agentic state is "store policy".

01:25:19.572 --> 01:25:21.824
It's, "I'm just doing my job."

01:25:22.992 --> 01:25:25.369
Or, "That's not my job."

01:25:25.578 --> 01:25:28.539
Or, "I don't make the rules."
"We don't do that here."

01:25:29.082 --> 01:25:32.251
"Just following orders."
"It's the law."

01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:35.546
In the agentic state,
the individual defines himself

01:25:35.755 --> 01:25:38.507
as an instrument carrying out
the wishes of others.

01:25:39.259 --> 01:25:41.510
A soldier, a nurse,
an administrator.

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.011
An actor.

01:25:43.179 --> 01:25:48.183
A corporate employee, or even,
yes, academics and artists.

01:25:48.351 --> 01:25:52.062
- Please continue.
- Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:54.690
- Mr. Dahlquist?
- Just shut up a minute!

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.192
Now, hold on.

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:04.158
- Come on, come on.
- Son of a bitch!

01:26:05.076 --> 01:26:07.244
A person has a choice.

01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:10.330
He or she chooses
to become agentic.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:15.586
But once you assume the role,
it's almost impossible to go back.

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:19.006
Wrong.

01:26:19.757 --> 01:26:21.842
A hundred
and ninety five volts.

01:26:22.385 --> 01:26:24.386
"Dance."

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.015
Let me out of here! Let me out!

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:30.184
- Continue, please.
- We always asked,

01:26:30.351 --> 01:26:32.060
"Is there anything
the man could've said

01:26:32.228 --> 01:26:34.104
to stop you from administering
the shocks?"

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:36.607
And they'd always say,
"No, I don't think so. No."

01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:38.233
I told you
I have a heart condition!

01:26:47.118 --> 01:26:48.327
Michele.

01:26:48.494 --> 01:26:50.579
Sit up here. All right?

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.084
Could we get a couple of
hot chocolates?

01:26:56.252 --> 01:26:57.812
- You want hot chocolate?
- Yes, please.

01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:00.088
- Hot chocolates all around?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:27:00.256 --> 01:27:02.799
Do you want anything?
Okay, no, we're fine.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:06.595
I need you to stay put,
stay in your seats. Okay?

01:27:17.106 --> 01:27:18.273
I'm sorry.

01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:23.028
I could say it a thousand times
and mean it every time.

01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:28.242
Marc, turn around in your seat.

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:37.084
Piaget.

01:27:40.505 --> 01:27:43.048
You remember when
I was translating Piaget?

01:27:45.718 --> 01:27:48.053
I hit this line about
child development.

01:27:49.514 --> 01:27:54.142
It's the specific point when
the growing child is able

01:27:54.310 --> 01:27:58.272
to recognize a gap between what
exists and what might exist.

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:01.566
And it occurred to me,
we choose our reality

01:28:01.734 --> 01:28:03.360
when we choose another person.

01:28:06.823 --> 01:28:08.198
What does that mean?

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:11.368
Marriage is not a fantasy.

01:28:11.661 --> 01:28:15.580
No, no, no, right.

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:17.416
Right.

01:28:19.460 --> 01:28:21.211
But it is a choice.

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:28.093
You have to know that I choose you.

01:28:29.929 --> 01:28:32.014
Every day I choose you.

01:28:44.527 --> 01:28:46.153
1984.

01:28:47.238 --> 01:28:49.072
1984 was a big year for me.

01:28:49.615 --> 01:28:51.825
My lecture fees peaked,
I was asked to speak

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:54.995
all over the world, about
the obedience experiments,

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:58.874
of course, in relation to
Orwell's prophetic book.

01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:02.711
A book that describes
a totalitarian world

01:29:02.879 --> 01:29:05.464
where people aren't very good
at thinking for themselves.

01:29:13.056 --> 01:29:15.557
♪ Who can explain it? ♪

01:29:15.725 --> 01:29:18.268
♪ Who can tell you why ♪

01:29:18.436 --> 01:29:21.146
♪ Fools give you reasons ♪

01:29:21.314 --> 01:29:28.111
♪ Wise men never try ♪

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:33.784
1984 was also the year
that I died.

01:29:44.712 --> 01:29:46.171
I was 51.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:56.264
Excuse me? We need to see
a doctor immediately.

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:59.601
I'm Stanley Milgram.
This is my ID.

01:29:59.769 --> 01:30:01.728
I believe I'm having
my fifth heart attack.

01:30:03.898 --> 01:30:05.399
Dr. Heissenbuttel...

01:30:05.608 --> 01:30:07.692
That's who treated me last time.

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:09.861
You need to fill this out.

01:30:10.029 --> 01:30:11.655
The agentic personality.

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:16.966
No one can truly know
what they might or might not do

01:31:17.096 --> 01:31:20.348
when presented with the demands
of a particular situation.

01:31:21.350 --> 01:31:24.269
In 2008, a professor at Santa
Clara University replicated

01:31:24.437 --> 01:31:28.356
the obedience experiments and
got roughly the same results.

01:31:28.524 --> 01:31:31.401
Over 60 percent of volunteers
delivered the full shocks.

01:31:32.403 --> 01:31:34.988
In 2010, the experiments
were duplicated

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:37.324
on a French reality TV show,

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:40.076
Le Jeu de la Mort,
The Game of Death.

01:31:40.244 --> 01:31:43.246
Participants were egged on by
a live studio audience.

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:45.832
Over 80 percent went all the way.

01:31:54.258 --> 01:31:57.093
Alexandra Milgram, Sasha,

01:31:57.261 --> 01:31:59.346
continues to live in
the apartment we shared

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:03.099
in Riverdale. Our children live
with their children

01:32:03.267 --> 01:32:04.976
near Boston and Toronto.

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:07.896
Sasha never remarried.

01:32:13.736 --> 01:32:16.112
The obedience experiments are
cited and discussed

01:32:16.531 --> 01:32:20.283
in nearly every introductory
psychology textbook worldwide.

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:23.578
My obedience film is screened

01:32:23.746 --> 01:32:25.956
for every incoming class
at West Point.

01:32:26.999 --> 01:32:30.252
And my methods and results
continue to be challenged,

01:32:30.419 --> 01:32:32.295
scorned, debunked,

01:32:32.463 --> 01:32:35.173
yet every time a new outrage is
unleashed into the world,

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:38.093
sanctioned and systematic acts
of violence,

01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:40.971
the obedience experiments
re-enter the conversation,

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:43.265
re-framing unanswerable questions.

01:32:45.434 --> 01:32:47.060
You could say we're puppets.

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:53.608
But I believe that we are puppets
with perception,

01:32:53.776 --> 01:32:55.193
with awareness.

01:32:55.361 --> 01:33:00.574
Sometimes we can see the strings
and, perhaps,

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:04.202
our awareness is the first step
in our liberation.
