NARRATOR: In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.670 --> 00:07.197
sexually based offenses
are considered
especially heinous,

00:07.273 --> 00:08.399
In New York City,

00:08.475 --> 00:11.376
the dedicated detectives
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.444 --> 00:15.005
are members
of an elite squad known
as the Special Victims Unit,

00:15.081 --> 00:17.072
These are their stories,

00:19.119 --> 00:20.245
Syd.

00:25.759 --> 00:26.851
Syd.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.392
Oh, this isn't gonna work.

00:37.337 --> 00:38.429
Syd.

00:42.075 --> 00:43.474
Oh, what...

00:44.277 --> 00:45.369
What the hell are you doing?

00:45.445 --> 00:48.505
If you want me to stay,
this is not gonna be...

00:48.581 --> 00:49.639
Syd.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.451
Oh, my God.

00:55.755 --> 00:57.848
Where's Dr. Warner?
Melinda's at an ME conference,

00:57.924 --> 00:59.755
so you're stuck with me
till the end of the week.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.987
So what's on the menu
for today, Justin?

01:02.062 --> 01:05.998
Looks Iike
autoerotic asphyxiation.
Sydney Green, early 30s.

01:06.299 --> 01:08.824
Husband found her.
STABLER: And he is where?

01:09.436 --> 01:13.202
He was flipping out.
So the unis drove him
to your precinct.

01:13.540 --> 01:15.132
We cut her down?
Husband did.

01:15.208 --> 01:16.835
Said he turned off
the music, too.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.104
Dead how Iong?

01:18.178 --> 01:20.772
Rigor was just setting,
so three, four hours tops.

01:20.847 --> 01:22.508
Okay. Any fluids?

01:22.749 --> 01:24.944
None apparent, but I don't
expect to find any.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.918
Autoerotics Iike to fly solo.

01:26.986 --> 01:29.079
Is that why you're Ieaning
toward accidental death?

01:29.155 --> 01:32.784
Skin pics, plus the sex toys
and the mirror. It's a gimme.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.626
But it's not official
till I cut her open.

01:34.694 --> 01:37.254
Well, until then, Iet's work
it as a sexual homicide.

01:37.330 --> 01:40.094
Female asphyxial deaths
are on the rise
across the country.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.861
If that's what this one was.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.061
I'II Iet you know.

01:45.638 --> 01:47.572
No sign of a break-in
or a struggle.

01:47.640 --> 01:51.303
The candles, the music,
that strikes me as
a seductive scene.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.743
Maybe she wanted
to treat herself.

01:53.813 --> 01:57.579
Most women don't go this far,
but they do Iike to
self-serve.

01:57.650 --> 02:01.177
STABLER: I guess you want
something done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074

02:49.335 --> 02:50.734
How Iong has your wife
been asphyxiating?

02:50.803 --> 02:51.861
No, that's crazy.

02:51.938 --> 02:54.338
Look, Sydney had never done
anything Iike that before.

02:54.407 --> 02:56.637
She's not that kind of person.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.843
And how Iong were you married?

02:58.912 --> 03:00.004
Six months.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.705
We were having problems.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.616
We decided to separate.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.847
How Iong were you together
before you got married?

03:08.922 --> 03:11.117
Just a few months.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.886
That's quick.

03:12.959 --> 03:14.950
That's why we separated.

03:15.461 --> 03:16.792
Look, I...

03:17.630 --> 03:20.326
It's only been a couple of
weeks. I just went over
to get a few things,

03:20.400 --> 03:23.460
and that's when I found her
Iike that.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.663
Where were you before that?

03:28.541 --> 03:32.170
Working. I'm an artist.
I have a Ioft
over in AIphabet City.

03:32.245 --> 03:35.078
And how come
you two weren't getting along?

03:36.549 --> 03:38.483
Irreconcilable differences.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.042
STABLER: What does that mean?
Cheating?
No.

03:41.254 --> 03:44.951
Look, just 'cause two people
Iove each other doesn't mean
they can Iive together.

03:45.024 --> 03:46.855
Why? Why are you asking me
these questions?

03:46.926 --> 03:48.223
I mean,
somebody killed my wife.

03:48.294 --> 03:49.488
Who wanted the divorce?

03:49.562 --> 03:53.259
We hadn't decided to file,
but I wanted the separation.

03:53.666 --> 03:54.690
We got married too fast.

03:54.767 --> 03:57.634
So then it is possible
that your wife hid
her sexual practices from you.

03:57.704 --> 04:00.867
Our sex Iife wasn't
the problem. When... Can I...

04:05.178 --> 04:07.908
Do you know when
you'II release my wife's body?

04:08.581 --> 04:10.310
We'II Iet you know.

04:15.154 --> 04:17.213
Any alarm bells going off
on the husband?

04:17.290 --> 04:18.483
Several.
He's hiding something.

04:18.558 --> 04:21.459
Getting off while choking
isn't something you share
with friends and family.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.654
People are always shocked
when they get
that kind of news.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.391
I still think the victim
was entertaining.

04:25.465 --> 04:28.457
She had a new man,
or hubby got there
earlier than he said.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.229
Well, if she had a partner,
it's manslaughter,

04:30.303 --> 04:32.635
whether the ME rules it
an accident or not.

04:32.705 --> 04:36.072
Did the victim have
any visitors
besides the husband?

04:36.776 --> 04:41.236
The visitors' Iog Iisted
a Pam Adler and Amelia Chase,
arrived around Iunchtime.

04:41.314 --> 04:42.872
Pam Adler,
the criminal attorney?

04:42.949 --> 04:44.974
Yeah. Rose, Adler & KIein.

04:45.051 --> 04:48.020
She cross-examined me
on a drug bust
where a cop got killed.

04:48.087 --> 04:49.577
Accused me
of police brutality.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.521
Don't tell me the perp
went to the hospital.

04:51.591 --> 04:54.424
Drug dealer's still alive,
the cop isn't.

04:54.861 --> 04:57.557
We'II take the Iawyer since
Fin's got history.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.858
Go.

05:01.934 --> 05:04.494
It's terrible. Did she suffer?

05:04.637 --> 05:07.128
STABLER: We really
can't answer that.
Were you two close friends?

05:07.206 --> 05:09.800
Yes. We met at Vassar.

05:11.678 --> 05:14.169
We had our whole Iives
ahead of us.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.178
And now she's dead.

05:18.151 --> 05:22.588
I just can't stop thinking
about her. First the divorce
and now this.

05:23.056 --> 05:24.751
We heard it was
a trial separation.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.793
Six-month-old marriage
and nothing but fights.

05:27.860 --> 05:31.853
Sydney couldn't take it
anymore, so she called
an attorney I know.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.523
Have you seen Sydney recently?

05:33.599 --> 05:36.124
She was supposed to meet
Amelia and me for Iunch.

05:36.202 --> 05:39.433
When she didn't show,
we went over to her apartment.

05:39.505 --> 05:44.204
Sydney said that she
wanted to be alone,
but I think she had company.

05:44.577 --> 05:45.839
What made you think that?

05:45.912 --> 05:47.106
She had on a robe.

05:47.180 --> 05:52.140
Candles were burning,
music was playing, and
the bedroom door was closed.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.585
Do you have any idea
who might have been with her?

05:54.654 --> 06:00.422
No. The divorce was hitting
her hard. She was depressed.
Andrew was no prize.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.889
STABLER: You don't Iike him?

06:03.262 --> 06:07.323
He's an artist
with questionable talent
who married a meal ticket.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.794
They met on
a Caribbean vacation.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.101
AIthough where
the Iittle bastard got
the money, I'II never know.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.607
I at Ieast convinced Syd
to sign a prenup.

06:16.676 --> 06:19.736
Is there anything else
that you can tell us
about her husband?

06:19.812 --> 06:23.407
Is there something
I should know?
Are you thinking foul play?

06:23.483 --> 06:27.943
Cause of death is still
pending so the Iaw says
we treat it as a homicide.

06:28.621 --> 06:32.523
What you know about the Iaw
I could fit
in the palm of my hand.

06:33.493 --> 06:35.222
How much was Mrs. Green worth?

06:35.294 --> 06:36.886
I don't have a clue.

06:36.963 --> 06:41.627
But call her divorce attorney,
he should have
a complete Iist of her assets.

06:42.802 --> 06:45.828
Thanks for waiting. This was
sudden, just a tragedy.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.634
What was Sydney Green's
financial status?

06:47.707 --> 06:50.574
She made a killing
in junk bonds but Iost
her shirt in the tech market.

06:50.643 --> 06:51.632
There's nothing Ieft?

06:51.711 --> 06:54.578
Apartment's mortgaged,
Iife insurance
will cover her debts.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.638
The husband
might clear 50 grand.

06:56.716 --> 06:57.978
That's still a Iot of money.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.608
In Manhattan? Don't kid me.

06:59.685 --> 07:01.983
Would he have walked away
empty-handed
had your client Iived?

07:02.054 --> 07:05.285
Absolutely. There was a prenup
and tax returns show
a Ioss after they married.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.986
Was Andrew Green aware of his
wife's financial situation?

07:08.060 --> 07:10.790
She handled the money,
so I don't see how.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.956
Her secretary said
she should be done by now.

07:13.032 --> 07:16.229
These day traders
Iive pretty good,
short hours, spa days.

07:16.302 --> 07:17.701
What the hell
is she doing in there?

07:17.770 --> 07:19.169
Beauty treatments take time.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.605
Mud bath,
cellulite dissipation,
an exfoliating facial.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.473
Time and money, some women
Iearn early how to waste both.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.035
Your ex-wives made you bitter.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.774
Not bitter, just resigned.

07:28.848 --> 07:31.078
The receptionist said
the police
were Iooking for me.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.242
You the detectives?

07:32.318 --> 07:35.185
Yeah, we'd Iike to talk to you
about Sydney Green.

07:35.254 --> 07:38.417
I still have
some errands to run.
Do you mind if we walk?

07:38.491 --> 07:39.981
How well did you know her?

07:40.059 --> 07:41.788
I met Sydney at OIdman.

07:41.861 --> 07:44.261
She made a fortune in junk
and got out early.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.491
Kept her toe in trading
for herself.

07:46.566 --> 07:49.797
We remained friends, although
she was a Iittle too risque
for my taste.

07:49.869 --> 07:51.598
Can you get more specific?

07:51.671 --> 07:53.935
I'm not interested
in titillating you, Detective.

07:54.006 --> 07:55.906
And we're not here
to carry your bags.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.567
Just speak up and we're gone.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.837
I don't understand.

07:58.911 --> 08:03.109
I mean, when Pam gave me
the news, I just naturally
thought it was an accident.

08:03.182 --> 08:04.809
Why would you assume that?

08:04.884 --> 08:06.078
I mean, she Iived on the edge.

08:06.152 --> 08:08.450
That's how she worked,
how she Iived,
a big risk-taker.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.079
Was she an adrenaline junkie?

08:10.156 --> 08:11.384
Nothing that extreme.

08:11.457 --> 08:15.291
But, you know, she got a rush
from gambling,
risky stocks, kinky sex.

08:15.361 --> 08:16.658
What kind of kinky sex?

08:16.729 --> 08:18.253
Like Iooping ropes
around the neck.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.423
Sick stuff Iike that.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.558
I mean,
she even tried to sell me,
but I wasn't buying.

08:21.634 --> 08:24.467
MUNCH: Doesn't sound Iike
you had much in common.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.266
You know, in some ways
we were kindred spirits.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.670
How so?

08:27.740 --> 08:29.571
There aren't too many women
in our business.

08:29.642 --> 08:31.109
And we both Iike
to make Iots of money

08:31.177 --> 08:34.578
and show up the entitled men
while we were doing it.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.113
Amelia Chase said
our victim was a choker.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.515
Were they close enough for
such an intimate confidence?

08:40.586 --> 08:44.181
Supposed to be kindred sisters
fighting male dominance
in the market.

08:44.256 --> 08:47.784
Yeah. They were so close
she seemed real broken up
by her friend's death.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.192
You think she or the Iawyer
had anything to do with it?

08:50.263 --> 08:52.857
Last people to see her alive,
but what's the motive?

08:52.932 --> 08:53.956
How does the husband Iook?

08:54.033 --> 08:55.022
STABLER: Pretty strong.

08:55.101 --> 08:56.295
He's got a negative
bank balance,

08:56.369 --> 08:58.769
and his credit report shows
Iots of bad debt write-off.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.271
The wife cut
the purse strings?

09:00.339 --> 09:01.704
She may not have had a choice.

09:01.774 --> 09:02.763
She was broke, too.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.275
Why kill her?

09:04.343 --> 09:05.810
Fifty grand's
better than nothing.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.436
Would that cover his debt?

09:07.513 --> 09:09.003
BENSON: And then some.

09:09.415 --> 09:11.178
Have we heard
from the ME's office yet?

09:11.250 --> 09:12.274
FIN: Not yet.

09:12.351 --> 09:15.013
AII right, well,
Iet's get down to the morgue,
Iean on the Assistant ME.

09:15.087 --> 09:17.419
We gotta know. Check with
Green's neighbors, all right?

09:17.490 --> 09:18.479
Find out how he's Iiving.

09:18.558 --> 09:22.153
If he still Iooks good,
bring him in
for a hard interview.

09:22.528 --> 09:25.395
You were drowning in bills.
Did you kill her
for the money?

09:25.464 --> 09:27.159
Money? There was no money.
We were broke.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.724
But you stand to inherit
50 grand from her death.
That's plenty.

09:29.802 --> 09:31.565
BENSON: You said
that she never choked.

09:31.637 --> 09:33.537
You said that she wasn't
that kind of person.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.904
But somebody else tells
a completely different story,

09:35.975 --> 09:37.442
that she did it all the time.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.307
Okay, which is it,
murder or accident?

09:39.378 --> 09:41.312
Now, if she choked,
then you either knew about it

09:41.380 --> 09:42.472
or you killed her outright.

09:42.548 --> 09:45.711
In that case, you're gonna
do some time yourself.

09:46.385 --> 09:51.618
Andrew, the system
will go a Iot easier on you
if it was an accident.

09:52.191 --> 09:54.625
But you need
to tell us the truth.

10:02.034 --> 10:05.697
We told everyone
we met on the islands,
but we really met in rehab.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.636
We just didn't want
anybody to know.

10:07.707 --> 10:08.833
STABLER: Which rehab facility?

10:08.908 --> 10:10.034
NarcAnon.

10:10.509 --> 10:12.568
Addiction to painkillers.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.373
We already knew the worst
about each other.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.109
I would've stood by her side
through anything.

10:17.183 --> 10:20.914
If she would only come clean,
maybe she'd still be alive.

10:21.153 --> 10:23.087
Came clean about what?

10:23.155 --> 10:26.613
Sydney was using drugs again,
Iosing control.

10:27.960 --> 10:31.418
She had a bachelor party,
and she and her friends

10:32.965 --> 10:34.660
attacked the male stripper.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.258
Was it reported to the police?

10:36.335 --> 10:37.359
Yeah.

10:38.237 --> 10:41.570
They were waiting for us on
our doorstep when we
returned from our honeymoon.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.404
BENSON: How badly
was this guy hurt?

10:43.476 --> 10:44.807
They raped him.

10:46.679 --> 10:48.806
That's why we were fighting.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.709
If somebody killed my wife,

10:52.885 --> 10:54.682
it was probably him.

11:05.464 --> 11:08.160
Excuse me.
Looking for Peter Smith.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.103
Is this about...
Yeah.

11:13.873 --> 11:16.637
I'm gonna take a break.
I won't be Iong.

11:17.176 --> 11:21.078
So, did you find out the names
of the other women
who raped me?

11:21.714 --> 11:24.239
Do you know a woman
named Sydney Green?

11:24.316 --> 11:26.284
You know I do.
Have you been
in contact with her?

11:26.352 --> 11:27.842
Have you seen her
since the alleged rape?

11:27.920 --> 11:29.080
AIIeged?

11:29.155 --> 11:32.386
No, I haven't seen her
or talked to her since she
and her friends attacked me.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.483
You sure about that? I mean,
I show your photo around

11:34.560 --> 11:37.461
and somebody from her building
IDs you, I'm not gonna
be so pleasant.

11:37.530 --> 11:41.125
Listen,
you're not here to help me,
so what's this about?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.331
Sydney Green is dead.

11:44.470 --> 11:45.630
And you think I killed her?

11:45.705 --> 11:47.332
You had a reason.

11:47.406 --> 11:49.567
Cops treated me Iike dirt.
They made fun of me,

11:49.642 --> 11:51.837
brought me to the hospital,
told the nurse it was a scam.

11:51.911 --> 11:55.210
I've got reason to be angry,
but I didn't kill anyone.

11:55.281 --> 11:57.647
We need an account
of your movements
two days ago.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.185
I was at the animal shelter
until Iate evening.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.243
Check with my supervisor.

12:03.656 --> 12:07.820
Sydney Green's building
has security. If he did it,
how did he get in?

12:10.496 --> 12:11.690
MUNCH: So, what's the verdict?

12:11.764 --> 12:13.493
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.625
She tightened the rope
around her neck, Iike so,

12:15.701 --> 12:19.398
and using an arm to support
her weight on the bed,
she Ieaned at a slight angle.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.236
But she miscalculated,
Iost control and passed out.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.503
Her body goes slack
and acts as a counterweight.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.738
We call it
gentle strangulation.

12:26.812 --> 12:27.938
That's comforting.

12:29.181 --> 12:30.944
STABLER: We sure this is
an accidental death?

12:31.016 --> 12:34.008
The Assistant ME's convinced.
He played it out
and it Iooked good to me.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.919
We don't have a suspect.
Peter's alibi panned out.

12:36.989 --> 12:39.514
No sign of a struggle.
No sign of a break-in.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.718
Do you want this
to be a homicide?

12:40.793 --> 12:41.987
I...

12:43.329 --> 12:44.387
I don't know,
but something's off.

12:44.463 --> 12:47.227
You can always take it up
with Warner when she gets back
from her conference,

12:47.299 --> 12:49.164
since you got so much
free time.

12:49.235 --> 12:51.430
Fine. Officially it's closed.

12:51.504 --> 12:54.200
Not quite. We still have
an open rape case.

12:55.207 --> 12:56.265
No.

12:57.009 --> 12:59.068
I already talked to Cragen
who already spoke with Cabot,

12:59.145 --> 13:02.546
and she'd Iike to see us
in her office, so, yeah.

13:04.784 --> 13:05.876
STABLER: Was he drugged?

13:05.951 --> 13:07.009
CABOT: He doesn't need to be.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.644
Was there even a weapon?

13:08.721 --> 13:09.745
None Iisted.

13:10.022 --> 13:13.219
Happened at
the bachelorette party.
Mob attack isn't unheard of.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.022
CABOT: Did the uniforms
follow up on
the suspect's complaint?

13:16.095 --> 13:18.029
They asked a few questions,
and then they dropped it.

13:18.097 --> 13:19.997
Because they didn't buy it
and neither do I.

13:20.065 --> 13:21.760
And more importantly,
neither will a jury.

13:21.834 --> 13:24.826
Well,
if the attack took place,
I'II make sure that they do.

13:24.904 --> 13:28.271
First male rape victim
with female perps, that adds
up to a Iot of attention,

13:28.340 --> 13:29.398
doesn't it, Counselor?

13:29.475 --> 13:31.067
I am not interested in that.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.667
He is the first man
to come forward.

13:32.745 --> 13:35.578
The statute for rape one
was changed in January,
Detective.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.378
What about his inability
to complete the act
against his will?

13:38.450 --> 13:40.418
An erection is
a physical response, EIIiot.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.851
If he was aroused,
he consented.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.513
Well, the Iaw disagrees
with you.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.420
So interview the victim
and get his statement.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.516
Well, it was your predecessor
who declined to prosecute.

13:47.593 --> 13:51.290
So maybe you should find out
why before we chase our tails.

13:51.931 --> 13:55.298
The alleged victim,
Peter Smith,
works as a male stripper.

13:55.367 --> 13:59.531
His shtick is dressing as
a motorcycle cop with a badge
covering the family jewels.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.835
One of the party guests
took photos. Check the file.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.238
So you decided
not to prosecute

14:03.309 --> 14:05.243
because you disapprove
of the victim's profession?

14:05.311 --> 14:06.505
Get off the soapbox, AIex.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.707
The guy claimed three women
cuffed him to the bed
and had a party.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.682
The bride claimed he was a pro
Iooking to score.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.218
Did Peter Smith have
a solicitation history?
No.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.617
Well, then why didn't you
pursue it?

14:15.688 --> 14:18.248
I'm not wasting taxpayer money
on a no-win.

14:18.324 --> 14:21.384
He just wasn't believable.
Even his Iive-in girlfriend
wasn't buying.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.655
The defense calls her
as a witness,
there goes the case.

14:23.729 --> 14:26.425
So the victim reports
the crime, and you just
Ieave him twisting.

14:26.498 --> 14:29.695
If you want to jeopardize
your standing on
a flimsy trial, be my guest.

14:29.768 --> 14:31.633
Okay. I need your notes.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.898
Done.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.462
You clear this with Villani?

14:34.540 --> 14:37.873
I don't have to. Sex crimes
is my purview. See you.

14:39.178 --> 14:40.907
Peter and I broke up
a Iong time ago,

14:40.980 --> 14:42.948
and I wasn't at the party.
So what can I tell you?

14:43.015 --> 14:44.812
We're just Iooking for some
background. That's all.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.408
You don't believe Peter
was raped, do you?

14:46.485 --> 14:47.474
Join the club.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.043
What makes you think
that he wasn't?

14:49.121 --> 14:51.954
He's a guy. Men don't
get raped by women.

14:52.258 --> 14:53.589
Men can be victimized.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.786
Sure.
When I first met Peter,

14:55.861 --> 14:58.557
he was being kept by some
woman 12 years older than him.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.532
She was paying for his tuition
at NYU Drama.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.591
His parents are well off.
Why wouldn't they support him?

15:03.669 --> 15:04.795
Because his father said

15:04.870 --> 15:07.634
he wasn't gonna shell out
25 grand a year
for a drama degree.

15:07.706 --> 15:08.934
Can't say I blame him.

15:09.008 --> 15:11.340
What do you think your ex's
motive is for coming forward?

15:11.410 --> 15:15.676
Attention. Peter cheated on me
with a casting director
to get a part in a play.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.545
He'II do whatever it takes
to get ahead.

15:17.616 --> 15:21.347
Making an accusation of rape
is pretty drastic,
don't you think?

15:21.420 --> 15:22.682
It's not gonna be
easy for him.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.019
The tabloids will pay
big money for the story.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.218
Interviews on talk shows,
pundit commentary on
the evening news.

15:28.294 --> 15:30.694
He probably thinks
it's worth it.

15:32.231 --> 15:33.755
Doesn't prove anything,
EIIiot.

15:33.832 --> 15:35.163
Except maybe we should
keep digging.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.600
Why? Because she told you
what you wanted to hear?

15:37.670 --> 15:41.470
It's not our job
to judge the victims.
That's up to the jury.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.603
I can give you an assessment
of your rape victim,

15:43.676 --> 15:45.610
but bear in mind,
I haven't examined him yet.

15:45.678 --> 15:49.978
How did Peter Smith
Iet three women
get the better of him?

15:50.749 --> 15:52.774
The guy works out.
He takes care of himself.

15:52.851 --> 15:54.876
And yet you tell women
not to fight back.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.080
That's different.

15:56.155 --> 15:57.213
Why?

15:59.591 --> 16:00.615
Because he's a man.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.684
Because he's stronger.
He can overpower them.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.524
Men are taught differently.

16:04.596 --> 16:08.896
You know, "Oh, it hurts,
but don't cry. Be a man.
Internalize the pain."

16:08.968 --> 16:11.198
Does the victim
have any siblings?

16:11.270 --> 16:12.999
Three sisters.
There you go.

16:13.072 --> 16:15.666
A Iifetime of instruction
on how to treat women.

16:15.741 --> 16:19.438
Never hit a female.
No manhandling.
If you're angry, walk away.

16:19.511 --> 16:24.471
Yeah, but if he felt trapped,
if they attacked him,
it's self-defense.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.177
Why not just fight back?

16:26.251 --> 16:29.084
Because he had no control
over the situation.

16:29.154 --> 16:34.353
His self-esteem
and his pride were violated.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.161
I wouldn't be surprised
if there were more
male victims out there.

16:39.231 --> 16:41.631
Female rage
is a growth industry.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.568
The price of equality.

16:46.105 --> 16:47.970
STABLER:
Are you still a stripper?

16:48.040 --> 16:49.507
No.

16:50.175 --> 16:54.612
Not since the rape.
I used to book birthdays
and private parties.

16:54.813 --> 16:56.644
It Ieft me free to audition
during the day.

16:56.715 --> 16:57.739
BENSON: So you're an actor.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.147
I gave it up.

17:01.253 --> 17:06.452
Okay, so you show up
in your cop outfit.

17:06.858 --> 17:09.953
Why don't you just run us
through what happened?

17:10.262 --> 17:13.698
I got there Iate. There were
about 30 women or so,

17:14.465 --> 17:18.095
pretty sauced and hungry
for entertainment.
I danced for them.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.001
Did you have anything
to eat or drink?

17:20.071 --> 17:21.198
Soda.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.834
I asked the bride-to-be
for my payment.

17:23.909 --> 17:25.968
She said to follow her,
the checkbook
was in her office.

17:26.045 --> 17:30.448
Did you feel different
after that drink, you know,
Iike you'd been drugged?

17:30.516 --> 17:32.006
Should I have been?

17:32.084 --> 17:33.847
Do you need a reason
why this happened to me?

17:33.919 --> 17:36.649
Why I wasn't man enough
to protect myself? Would
that make you feel better?

17:36.722 --> 17:37.882
Peter.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.190
What happened then?

17:42.261 --> 17:44.024
We get to the room,
but it was dark.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.462
She made her way to the desk
and turned the Iamp on.

17:46.532 --> 17:49.831
It was a spare bedroom,
and two other women
were waiting.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.392
Did they call
each other by name?

17:51.470 --> 17:55.770
No. One of them had
a Ietter opener.
She tried to stab me.

17:55.841 --> 18:00.574
The other two
were pulling me back.
They cuffed me to the bedpost.

18:01.346 --> 18:05.043
I started yelling, but Sydney
turned the stereo on Ioud.

18:07.986 --> 18:09.317
Then what?

18:19.832 --> 18:23.598
They yanked my pants off
and tossed them.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.594
Underwear, too.

18:30.709 --> 18:32.336
I didn't want to,

18:33.045 --> 18:35.639
but my body...

18:38.884 --> 18:40.112
I can't explain it.

18:40.185 --> 18:42.210
Arousal does not mean consent.

18:42.387 --> 18:46.483
And rapists use the body's
response against the victims
to mess with their head,

18:46.558 --> 18:49.220
to make them believe
that they were asking for it.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.125
Does this type of thing happen
to women, too?

18:51.196 --> 18:53.130
Yeah. It happens a Iot.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.767
What about the other guests?
Where were they?

18:57.336 --> 19:01.773
Still partying,
until Sydney Ieft the room.
I guess she cleared the place.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.603
Did you ever say no?

19:05.577 --> 19:07.704
I yelled it. I screamed it.

19:09.081 --> 19:11.311
I even threatened
to go to the police.

19:11.383 --> 19:14.750
One cold bitch said
that what I knew about the Iaw

19:14.820 --> 19:17.414
wouldn't fit
in the palm of her hand.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.886
Pam Adler was in that bedroom.

19:24.963 --> 19:28.228
Which means Amelia Chase
is probably the third member
of this rape troika.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.268
I'm not so sure
he's being entirely candid.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.495
He was raped, EIIiot.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.265
He's an actor. He's trained
to make us believe.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.466
Three women at the same time,
most guys would
call that Iucky.

19:36.542 --> 19:40.706
So we're saying that men
are sex hounds and only women
can feel violated?

19:40.779 --> 19:41.871
That's gender bias.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.938
Most women don't report rapes.
What's his angle?

19:44.016 --> 19:46.450
We can't ask that question.
Wouldn't ask a female victim.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.509
We question female victims
all the time.

19:48.587 --> 19:51.055
CRAGEN: This pans out,
the press is gonna
feed on this guy Iike carrion.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.215
And maybe that's the point.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.350
Front page splash,
this guy's an instant star.

19:54.426 --> 19:56.360
You think that he's doing this
for the fame?

19:56.428 --> 19:58.293
Some people
will do anything for it.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.422
CRAGEN: Doesn't matter.
He's a complaining witness.

20:00.499 --> 20:03.366
So bring in Adler and Chase
and do a Iineup.

20:07.739 --> 20:09.206
You can't come in here.

20:09.274 --> 20:11.265
FIN:
Consider the market closed.

20:11.343 --> 20:15.006
I can't talk now, Detectives.
But if you'd Iike to wait
in reception...

20:15.080 --> 20:16.672
No. No. No. No.
Not you, KIaus.

20:16.748 --> 20:19.342
Deutsch marks are up
three points. Will it hold?

20:19.418 --> 20:21.511
We need you down
at the precinct, Miss Chase.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.111
I'II call you back, KIaus.

20:23.188 --> 20:24.621
When?
Now.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.658
For what reason?
FIN: A Iineup.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.317
Am I under arrest?

20:28.393 --> 20:29.655
MUNCH:
Depends on what happens.

20:29.861 --> 20:31.158
Then I'm not coming with you.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.595
That's fine, but when
we come back to get you,

20:32.664 --> 20:35.326
it's gonna be midday
on the trading-room floor.

20:39.972 --> 20:42.167
Remember,
Iet me do all the talking.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.142
Don't react to anything
that's being said about you.

20:45.210 --> 20:46.609
Put your poker face on.
You got it?

20:46.678 --> 20:49.146
Counselor, good afternoon.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.406
I'm due in court,
so whatever it is
it's just gonna have to wait.

20:52.484 --> 20:53.815
I don't think so.

20:53.885 --> 20:54.909
What's this about?

20:54.987 --> 20:56.955
Rape in the First Degree.

20:57.022 --> 20:58.353
You're not serious.

21:02.060 --> 21:06.224
Ask for a continuance.
If not, get Bob down here
to sit first chair.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.694
Shall we?

21:11.837 --> 21:12.895
Carolyn Maddox.

21:12.971 --> 21:14.370
AIexandra Cabot
for the People.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.272
So I've read.
People v, Hightower,

21:17.342 --> 21:21.335
You Iost due to shaky evidence
and the inexperience
of a rookie.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.940
Defense counsel of record
was Pamela Adler.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.177
I hope this isn't petulance,
Counselor.

21:26.251 --> 21:29.015
Your main concern should be
the Iineup, Miss Maddox.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.555
Good.
You didn't jump for the bait.

21:31.623 --> 21:35.081
I think you'II make
a formidable opponent.
Let's do it.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.203
Number three.

21:52.277 --> 21:53.369
BENSON: Are you sure?

21:54.079 --> 21:55.637
Take your time.

21:57.649 --> 22:00.140
"What I know about the Iaw,"
remember?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.946
I'm positive, number three.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.921
That's two for two.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.717
Read Miss Adler her rights.

22:12.698 --> 22:15.997
Looks Iike we're gonna be
famous. See you in court.

22:22.274 --> 22:25.368
"File numbers 434, 546 and 47.

22:25.444 --> 22:28.038
"Rape in the First Degree.
Sodomy in the First Degree.

22:28.113 --> 22:30.741
"Unlawful Imprisonment
and Assault in the Third."

22:30.816 --> 22:32.750
Is this accurate, Counselor?

22:32.851 --> 22:34.512
I wouldn't waste
the court's time, Your Honor.

22:34.586 --> 22:36.053
I'm not entirely sure
about that,

22:36.121 --> 22:38.851
since you're trying to set
a very unusual precedent.

22:38.924 --> 22:42.553
My sentiments exactly. Perhaps
someone's Iooking for ink.

22:42.627 --> 22:43.855
Objection.

22:43.929 --> 22:46.397
Save your strength,
Miss Cabot. You'II need it.

22:46.465 --> 22:48.092
How do you plead?
Not guilty.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.066
Not guilty.
Are we severing?

22:50.135 --> 22:51.363
Not at this time.

22:51.436 --> 22:53.233
Any objection to recognizance?

22:53.305 --> 22:54.636
None, Your Honor.

22:54.906 --> 22:56.237
Next case.

22:56.875 --> 23:00.470
I admit to having
intimate sexual relations
with the alleged victim,

23:00.545 --> 23:03.378
a venal young man
who wants to be famous.

23:03.548 --> 23:07.177
My only crime is being
a confident,
assertive professional

23:07.252 --> 23:09.550
with a healthy
sexual appetite.

23:09.654 --> 23:10.985
If Peter Smith succeeds,

23:11.056 --> 23:15.288
it will only numb the public
to the real plight
of rape victims everywhere.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.486
By the time she's through,

23:16.561 --> 23:18.028
she'II have victims'
advocates,

23:18.096 --> 23:21.088
feminists and enlightened men
burning you in effigy.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.497
Thanks for the heads up.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.467
This indictment's Iudicrous.

23:24.536 --> 23:27.232
Your client can spin
all she wants. We both know
what happened that night.

23:27.305 --> 23:29.432
The grand jury
believed the victim,
another jury will, too.

23:29.508 --> 23:33.171
You're making a mockery
of women who are
preyed on by men.

23:33.678 --> 23:35.839
They're the enemy,
not my client.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.041
I guess I just heard
your closing argument.

23:38.116 --> 23:41.847
There won't be a trial.
See you in chambers.

23:49.361 --> 23:51.158
You wanted to see me?

23:51.263 --> 23:54.164
AIex, it's a pretty
high-profile case.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.427
You sure
you haven't bitten off
more than you can chew?

23:56.501 --> 23:57.559
I don't think so.

23:57.636 --> 24:01.538
But I guess since I've been
summoned here you don't agree.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.405
Well, I have some doubts.

24:03.475 --> 24:04.703
May I ask why?

24:04.776 --> 24:08.143
Using a male stripper
in the first real test
of the rape statute

24:08.213 --> 24:09.874
is not a very
judicious choice.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.381
His profession is irrelevant.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.213
Are you asking me
to dismiss the charges?

24:13.285 --> 24:14.547
No.

24:15.086 --> 24:17.953
But I hope you won't mind
if Stan sits first chair.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.623
You say that as if
I had a choice.

24:21.693 --> 24:23.524
Oh, come on. We'II tag team.

24:23.595 --> 24:27.998
I just want you handling cross
on the female defendants
if they elect to testify.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.360
I don't want to Iook Iike
Rick Lazio bullying Hillary.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.533
You want me to run
for coffee, too,

24:33.605 --> 24:36.073
or am I just the female
attorney by your side
for the cameras?

24:36.141 --> 24:38.234
You're a highly skilled
attorney.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.073
I have every faith
in your abilities.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.772
But I'm still sitting
second chair.

24:41.847 --> 24:44.941
You also have a personal
history with Pam Adler.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.080
People will question
your motives.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.983
I Iost an important case
to her once.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.885
That does not mean
I have an agenda.

24:50.956 --> 24:54.289
I don't Iike to play politics,
but we can't be naive.

24:54.626 --> 24:57.322
If they find a way to use it,
they will.

24:57.729 --> 24:58.957
Preemptive strike?

24:59.030 --> 25:04.024
That, and just making sure
that our complaining witness
is protected

25:04.135 --> 25:06.262
and represented
to the best of our ability.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.307
We speak for him, so Iet's
keep our eye on the ball.

25:12.177 --> 25:15.237
They want us to think
it's a motion to dismiss.

25:23.755 --> 25:26.280
They're trying to challenge
the Iaw.

25:29.628 --> 25:31.459
This is a deceptive
attempt by the defense

25:31.530 --> 25:33.657
to argue constitutional Iaw
in front of you.

25:33.732 --> 25:36.064
This should only be heard
in an appellate court.

25:36.134 --> 25:38.068
I intend to prove merit
for dismissal.

25:38.136 --> 25:41.936
The Iegislature saw fit
to change the Iaw
for political correctness.

25:42.007 --> 25:43.133
The old rape statute said

25:43.208 --> 25:45.836
that only a man can be charged
with Rape in the First.

25:45.911 --> 25:47.071
That's gender bias.

25:47.145 --> 25:48.635
People v, Liberta,

25:48.914 --> 25:52.680
A bias pointed out by
a wife-raping convict
trying to get out on appeal.

25:52.751 --> 25:56.084
Mr. Liberta did not win
that appeal and the only thing
the brief accomplished

25:56.154 --> 25:58.418
was to force the Iegislature
to change the Iaw.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.981
And they were so outraged
by the bias in the Iaw

26:01.059 --> 26:04.495
that it took them 23 years
to do it. PIease.

26:05.897 --> 26:07.296
Counselors?

26:08.333 --> 26:09.732
It's still a constitutional
argument,

26:09.801 --> 26:13.100
and it should only be heard
if Miss Maddox
Ioses the trial.

26:14.439 --> 26:17.408
If it's all right with you,
I'II hear the argument anyway.

26:17.475 --> 26:22.276
And trust me when I say,
be prepared,
be diligent and be very brief.

26:26.851 --> 26:30.947
Rape is a violation of body
and mind, a violation that
comes through penetration.

26:31.022 --> 26:32.853
Women can't rape men.

26:32.924 --> 26:36.690
A woman can be prosecuted
for sodomy one by fellating
a man against his will.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.752
She's not the penetrant,
but she's still guilty.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.889
I contend that arousal
implies consent.

26:40.966 --> 26:44.163
A physiological response
does not override a vocal,
"No."

26:44.235 --> 26:47.295
Most men do not
maintain an erection
through fear, Counselor.

26:47.372 --> 26:50.830
But some men do.
What do you propose,
a tumescence exam?

26:51.142 --> 26:53.736
Save the wit for your friends,
Miss Cabot.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.442
Medical studies document

26:56.514 --> 27:00.075
that some female victims
experience arousal
during their attacks.

27:00.151 --> 27:02.642
Rape is not about sex.
Rape is about violence,

27:02.721 --> 27:04.018
and rape is about control.

27:04.089 --> 27:07.286
No woman has ever
been brought to trial
under this charge

27:07.359 --> 27:09.452
because we're the victims,
not the perpetrators.

27:09.527 --> 27:12.087
It was not that Iong ago
that the court reacted
with disbelief

27:12.163 --> 27:14.427
that a mother could murder
her own child.

27:14.499 --> 27:16.626
Now she's the first person
we suspect.

27:16.701 --> 27:19.670
Your Honor, women do not have
the anatomical equipment

27:19.738 --> 27:21.968
to be equal to men
under this Iaw.

27:23.575 --> 27:24.803
The Iaw makes no room

27:24.876 --> 27:27.709
for selective equality
under the First Amendment.

27:27.779 --> 27:30.771
Either women are equal to men,
or they aren't.

27:31.016 --> 27:32.677
Motion to dismiss is denied.

27:39.591 --> 27:41.821
So, this means we go to trial?

27:41.893 --> 27:43.019
It's a minor victory.

27:43.128 --> 27:44.459
Now comes the hard part.

27:44.529 --> 27:46.224
It's already started.

27:46.297 --> 27:48.925
I'm getting harassed.
Nasty phone calls.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.164
Women following me,
shouting at me. Chased
by reporters and cameras.

27:53.371 --> 27:54.804
Well, it's only
going to get worse,

27:54.873 --> 27:57.535
because now the defense
has a chance to dig around
in your background,

27:57.609 --> 27:59.076
poke holes in your story.

27:59.144 --> 28:01.169
So anything
you want to change,
you'd better do now.

28:01.246 --> 28:04.010
My father told me my private
Iife was inadmissible.

28:04.082 --> 28:05.811
Putting the victim on trial
isn't allowed.

28:05.884 --> 28:06.942
It isn't.

28:07.018 --> 28:10.613
But I have to be honest
with you, there are ways
to get around it.

28:11.389 --> 28:14.552
You seem very concerned.
Is there something
you haven't told me?

28:14.626 --> 28:15.650
No.

28:17.962 --> 28:21.489
Okay. Go home, get some rest.

28:24.135 --> 28:26.501
Is there any way
I can get a ride?

28:26.571 --> 28:28.664
I know the vultures
are waiting out there.

28:28.740 --> 28:30.970
Yeah, I'II take care of it.

28:34.846 --> 28:38.407
VILLANI: What time did
Peter Smith show up
at the party, Miss Guevere?

28:38.483 --> 28:42.613
I can't be sure
after all this time.
But around 10:00, maybe.

28:42.687 --> 28:44.416
What happened then?

28:44.889 --> 28:47.016
He did his dance.

28:47.258 --> 28:51.126
He was shaking his stuff
in our faces,

28:51.930 --> 28:57.027
and we'd slide dollars
into his thong. It had
a big badge in the front.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.933
Were the defendants
present at that time?

29:02.006 --> 29:04.804
To be honest,
my attention was elsewhere.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.574
So, when did you notice
their absence?

29:07.645 --> 29:10.443
When poor Sydney came out
and told us all to Ieave.

29:10.515 --> 29:13.177
To Ieave?
Why do you think she did that?

29:13.251 --> 29:14.650
Objection. Speculation.

29:15.620 --> 29:16.609
Sustained.

29:16.688 --> 29:18.121
VILLANI: I'II rephrase.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.754
Was this something
that Miss Green usually did?

29:20.825 --> 29:23.385
I mean, did she usually
invite people over
and then put them out?

29:23.461 --> 29:27.488
No, she'd had parties before
and never acted Iike that.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.768
I thought it was rude
at the time,

29:32.170 --> 29:35.435
but I needed to get home
and relieve the babysitter.

29:36.374 --> 29:37.966
Nothing further.

29:41.346 --> 29:43.974
I have no questions
for this witness.

29:45.183 --> 29:50.815
VILLANI: So, how did
Pam Adler, Sydney Green
and Amelia Chase subdue you?

29:50.922 --> 29:54.358
One of them had
a Ietter opener.
She tried to stab me.

29:55.126 --> 29:58.755
I kept backing up.
I just thought
she'd had too much to drink.

29:58.830 --> 30:01.663
So, did you try to subdue her?
Did you try to get the weapon?

30:01.733 --> 30:05.931
I couldn't. By this time,
the other two
were pulling me back.

30:07.005 --> 30:10.236
I still thought I was okay.
Women get a Iittle drunk,

30:10.308 --> 30:12.970
blow off some steam away from
their husbands for a night.

30:13.044 --> 30:14.944
I usually handle it
and shrug it off.

30:15.013 --> 30:16.037
But this was different?

30:16.114 --> 30:17.843
Objection, Ieading.

30:19.350 --> 30:22.547
What happened to make
this time different
than all the other times

30:22.620 --> 30:25.214
when you had Ieft a job
unscathed?

30:26.958 --> 30:29.483
When they cuffed me
to the bedpost.

30:29.928 --> 30:30.917
It was so quick.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.054
Who cuffed you to the bedpost?

30:37.735 --> 30:42.468
For the record, the witness
is pointing to the defendant,
Amelia Chase.

30:42.907 --> 30:44.670
And nothing further.

30:46.477 --> 30:48.377
Objection.
Objection.

30:48.813 --> 30:50.075
Approach.

30:56.788 --> 31:00.451
I find an accused rapist
cross-examining
the victim repulsive.

31:00.525 --> 31:01.651
Explain yourself.

31:01.726 --> 31:04.559
Your Honor, Miss Adler
is a member of the bar
in good standing.

31:04.629 --> 31:05.926
She's the co-counsel
of record,

31:05.997 --> 31:09.194
and she's protected
by the constitution
to run her own defense.

31:09.267 --> 31:12.031
This is an intimidation tactic
used to undermine the witness.

31:12.103 --> 31:13.832
She is asking him
to relive the rape.

31:13.905 --> 31:15.668
Objection, alleged rape.

31:15.740 --> 31:17.970
It's an aggressive
psychological ploy.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.306
That may very well
be the case, Mr. Villani,

31:20.378 --> 31:23.176
but I don't have the power
to bar her from cross.

31:23.982 --> 31:25.882
You take one step
over the Iine

31:25.950 --> 31:29.078
and I will hold you
in contempt for the duration.

31:30.288 --> 31:31.653
Step back.

31:41.699 --> 31:46.193
Mr. Smith, do you go to a gym,
work out on a regular basis?

31:46.271 --> 31:48.068
Objection, relevance.

31:48.539 --> 31:51.201
My Iine of questioning
is within the scope.

31:51.342 --> 31:52.570
I can clearly prove

31:52.644 --> 31:57.240
that this man is more than
capable of protecting himself
from three women.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.011
PETROVSKY: Sustained.

32:00.985 --> 32:02.714
Move on, Counselor.

32:06.391 --> 32:11.385
Mr. Smith, did you file
a civil suit for five million
dollars against Sydney Green?

32:14.132 --> 32:16.692
Sir, don't Iook at them.
Look at me.

32:17.702 --> 32:19.431
Did you file a civil suit?

32:19.504 --> 32:20.732
Objection. Badgering.

32:20.805 --> 32:22.102
PETER: I needed information.

32:22.173 --> 32:23.435
ADLER: Yes or no?

32:23.508 --> 32:24.770
That's not how it was.

32:26.377 --> 32:29.471
Your Honor, please order
the witness to answer.

32:29.881 --> 32:32.782
Sir, you have to answer
the question for the record.

32:38.556 --> 32:39.614
Yes.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.061
Defense exhibit, Your Honor.

32:51.903 --> 32:57.136
A copy of the civil suit filed
by the alleged rape victim,
four months ago.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.733
I didn't want money.
I wanted names.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.944
Your Honor, I move
for immediate dismissal.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.291
What went wrong?

33:17.362 --> 33:19.296
Your suspicions
were confirmed, Detective.

33:19.364 --> 33:22.231
We were blind-sided
by a civil suit
filed by our rape victim.

33:22.300 --> 33:24.427
I'm sorry, Miss Cabot.
I didn't think it mattered.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.231
Everything matters.

33:26.371 --> 33:29.568
You jeopardized this trial.
What else did you Iie about?

33:29.640 --> 33:30.629
Nothing.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.175
Now why would anybody
believe that?

33:32.243 --> 33:34.643
Why didn't you tell us
about the Iawsuit, Peter?

33:34.712 --> 33:37.442
Detective Stabler's
been on my ass
from the very beginning,

33:37.515 --> 33:38.641
Iooking for any reason
to drop it.

33:38.716 --> 33:41.276
If I'd have told you
about the suit, he would've
said I just wanted money.

33:41.352 --> 33:43.582
Well, isn't that what
this has been about all along,

33:43.654 --> 33:45.019
a payday for you,
a Iittle media attention?

33:45.089 --> 33:49.788
No. I wanted my
rapists' names. The cops
didn't treat me seriously.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.692
How else was I supposed
to get the information?

33:51.763 --> 33:54.197
If you'd won, you would've
received a monetary award.

33:54.265 --> 33:56.790
If I won, the money
would have gone
to the animal shelter,

33:56.868 --> 33:59.063
and my rapists' names
would've gone
on the public record.

33:59.137 --> 34:00.195
That's very noble.

34:00.271 --> 34:01.795
But I still don't see
how we're gonna prove

34:01.873 --> 34:03.500
that your motives
are anything but venal.

34:03.574 --> 34:06.042
What if we talk
to the civil attorney,
get some corroboration?

34:06.110 --> 34:07.304
Can we put him on the stand?

34:07.378 --> 34:08.675
This is just a spin.

34:08.746 --> 34:11.976
What have you got
against me? I was raped.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.414
Sydney Green
was coming forward.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.715
What? Sydney Green called you?

34:17.188 --> 34:20.748
My Iawyer. After you accused
me of killing her,
I called him.

34:20.824 --> 34:22.918
He said Sydney had agreed
to give me the names,

34:22.994 --> 34:26.589
but the death
nullified the suit.
So what did I do wrong?

34:32.036 --> 34:34.504
Turns out Peter
was telling the truth.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.132
The Iawyer said
he didn't want the money,
just the names.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.766
Did he confirm Sydney Green's
compliance?

34:38.842 --> 34:39.969
The day before her death,

34:40.043 --> 34:41.944
she contacted the Iawyer
to set up a meeting.

34:42.013 --> 34:43.105
STABLER: That's convenient.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.274
BENSON:
Sounds Iike motive for murder.

34:45.550 --> 34:49.315
Saves the trouble
of a high-profile trial,
maybe even a prison sentence.

34:49.387 --> 34:52.379
I re-interviewed Andrew Green.
He didn't know
about the civil suit.

34:52.456 --> 34:55.824
But Pam Adler had a copy
of it. How did she
even know it existed?

34:55.893 --> 34:57.724
The record gets expunged
when abated by death,

34:57.795 --> 34:59.660
so Adler had to have
a prior copy.

34:59.730 --> 35:03.257
Sydney Green calls up
her friends, tells them she's
giving in, they kill her.

35:03.334 --> 35:06.599
I thought the medical examiner
ruled the death accidental.

35:06.671 --> 35:08.696
No harm in taking
a second Iook.

35:09.474 --> 35:13.205
Justin's a good pathologist
but not very imaginative.

35:13.277 --> 35:14.972
You find something?

35:15.046 --> 35:18.538
Female autoerotics are rare,
so it's hard to rule
on cause of death.

35:18.616 --> 35:20.982
Which is why the first
suspicion was homicide.

35:21.052 --> 35:23.680
But in this case,
that's what it should've been.

35:23.754 --> 35:25.381
What did he miss?

35:25.456 --> 35:28.516
Most women don't use porn.
They fantasize.

35:29.026 --> 35:33.759
AIso, autoeroticism is
habit-forming. If your victim
frequently choked herself,

35:33.831 --> 35:38.097
where's her towel
or silk scarf, something
to keep the rope from chafing?

35:38.603 --> 35:41.868
It's vanity. No way to explain
the ring around the collar.

35:41.939 --> 35:43.099
Some women don't use a buffer,

35:43.174 --> 35:46.337
so they'II wear a turtleneck
or a scarf, something
to hide the evidence.

35:46.410 --> 35:47.570
Well, if she were strangled,

35:47.645 --> 35:49.636
wouldn't there be some
evidence of a struggle,

35:49.714 --> 35:50.840
damage to the body?

35:50.915 --> 35:53.884
It didn't take Iong
for the victim
to succumbed to hypoxia.

35:53.951 --> 35:56.977
And the ropes
were tied properly,
so whoever staged this

35:57.054 --> 35:58.851
is a practicing autoerotic.

35:58.923 --> 36:02.017
Okay. Well, Doc,
you wanna take a Iook
at the crime scene?

36:02.093 --> 36:03.185
Sure.

36:04.762 --> 36:06.491
So the phone dump
shows two calls,

36:06.564 --> 36:08.225
one to each woman
the morning of the attack.

36:08.299 --> 36:11.860
She gives them the news that
she's caving in to Peter's
demands to save her marriage.

36:11.936 --> 36:13.665
They decide to kill her.
They come prepared.

36:13.738 --> 36:17.902
Quickest way to do that is
a blitz attack right here,
not in the bedroom.

36:17.975 --> 36:19.670
You be the victim.

36:21.112 --> 36:22.443
Okay.

36:22.880 --> 36:26.008
They say, "Come on, Sydney,
Iet's talk about this.

36:26.083 --> 36:28.244
"There's gotta be another way
that we can handle this,

36:28.319 --> 36:30.651
"so we can deal with it,
okay?"

36:31.689 --> 36:35.090
AII right. You did say
there was no struggle.

36:35.159 --> 36:38.959
Exert a Iittle pressure,
and anoxia would occur
almost immediately.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.488
As soon as she's out cold,
they carry her
into the bedroom.

36:42.567 --> 36:47.402
Truss her, string her to
the fan, and the hypoxia
takes care of the rest.

36:47.738 --> 36:51.697
We're thinking they staged
the scene, candles,
music, sexy teddy?

36:51.776 --> 36:54.643
Maybe they didn't have to.
She was waiting
for her husband.

36:54.712 --> 36:55.838
A Iittle make-up sex.

36:55.913 --> 36:57.881
Looping the ropes
would have taken some time.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.383
Not if you know
what you're doing.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.683
CSU didn't dust for prints.

37:06.757 --> 37:09.920
Not the whole beam.
Just the area around the fan.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.633
This better be good,
Miss Cabot.

37:16.701 --> 37:17.895
It is.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.337
Your client is under arrest
for the murder
of Sydney Green.

37:21.405 --> 37:22.667
So Iet's horse trade.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.537
Depends on what you have.

37:24.609 --> 37:27.009
PIead out to murder two
and all current charges.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.978
In exchange for her testimony
against Pam Adler,

37:29.046 --> 37:32.038
I'II give 12 and a half
for the homicide,
7-to-15 for the rape.

37:32.116 --> 37:34.380
Your generosity overwhelms me.

37:34.452 --> 37:37.216
It's a good deal, Mr. Harper.
Your client would be
advised to take it.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.188
What are you basing this on?

37:39.257 --> 37:42.124
Miss Chase's prints were found
at the crime scene.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.353
My client was a friend.

37:44.428 --> 37:48.125
She's been to the apartment
several times.
Prints will never hold up.

37:48.199 --> 37:50.360
The victim was strangled,
Mr. Harper.

37:50.434 --> 37:53.733
Your client's prints
were found on the bedroom
ceiling above the bed.

37:53.804 --> 37:57.865
We also searched her apartment
and found autoerotic
paraphernalia.

38:00.177 --> 38:03.010
It's all circumstantial.
We're done here.

38:04.348 --> 38:07.317
Ask your client
to remove the scarf
from around her neck.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.353
Oh, now, please...
Stop.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.847
Crunch your numbers again.

38:13.457 --> 38:17.587
By the time I get out of
prison, I'II be eligible for
senior citizens' discounts.

38:17.662 --> 38:20.324
If I take this to trial,
you'II get Iife.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.210
Tell me about the rape.

38:34.945 --> 38:38.574
Sydney was getting married.
Neither one of us
Iiked the guy.

38:38.649 --> 38:40.514
He seemed beneath her.

38:40.818 --> 38:45.221
So Sydney planned her own
shower, booked a male stripper
as entertainment.

38:45.289 --> 38:49.055
CABOT: So Peter Smith
entertained the Iadies
and then what?

38:49.894 --> 38:51.156
Pam pulled me aside,

38:51.228 --> 38:54.857
said she'd worked out
an arrangement with the guy
for a private performance.

38:54.932 --> 38:57.230
I thought, "What the hell?"
He was hot.

38:57.301 --> 38:58.632
What happened then?

38:59.837 --> 39:02.431
Pam and I went into
Sydney's office to wait.

39:02.506 --> 39:04.940
After Peter followed
Mrs. Green into the bedroom,

39:05.009 --> 39:06.738
what happened next?

39:07.178 --> 39:09.703
We cuffed him to the bed
and raped him.

39:09.780 --> 39:14.308
I got his keys out of his
pants pocket and released him
when we were done.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.582
Pam threw some cash at him
and he Ieft.

39:17.955 --> 39:20.048
Thank you. Nothing further.

39:23.828 --> 39:27.161
Do you know
how the Iaw defines Rape
in the First Degree?

39:27.231 --> 39:30.291
Sexual intercourse
through forcible compulsion.

39:34.105 --> 39:36.335
And is it your testimony that
that's what happened?

39:36.407 --> 39:37.533
That's correct?

39:37.608 --> 39:38.700
Yes.

39:41.379 --> 39:46.715
Three women raped a 6-foot,
170-pound man.

39:47.852 --> 39:49.410
Is that what you did?

39:49.487 --> 39:50.476
Yes.

39:51.155 --> 39:57.094
Well, did any of you
have a gun, a knife,
a weapon of any kind at all?

39:57.161 --> 39:59.152
Pam had been waving
a Ietter opener.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.788
Well, was it sharp?

40:01.999 --> 40:03.023
No.

40:03.100 --> 40:05.125
Did my client say anything
to the stripper?

40:05.770 --> 40:07.032
Did she give him orders?

40:07.104 --> 40:11.837
No. She Iunged at him
a couple of times,
and he kept jumping back.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.646
Who handcuffed him to the bed?

40:23.320 --> 40:24.514
I did.

40:25.089 --> 40:29.788
So you raped the stripper,
not my client. My client
paid for his services.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.691
Objection.
Is there a question?

40:31.762 --> 40:33.093
Sorry.

40:33.464 --> 40:37.298
Did paying Mr. Smith
seem Iike the act of a rapist

40:38.002 --> 40:39.697
or that of
a satisfied customer?

40:39.770 --> 40:40.794
Objection.

40:40.871 --> 40:44.773
Was it your testimony
that Miss Adler made
arrangements for Mr. Smith

40:44.842 --> 40:46.605
to have a private performance?

40:46.677 --> 40:47.939
That's what she said but...

40:48.012 --> 40:49.912
And did you see her
give him money?

40:49.980 --> 40:52.073
A simple yes or no will do.

40:53.818 --> 40:54.910
Yes.

41:09.200 --> 41:13.261
On the charge of Rape
in the First Degree,
how do you find the defendant?

41:13.337 --> 41:14.736
Not guilty.

41:15.239 --> 41:18.174
On the charge of Sodomy
in the First Degree?

41:18.609 --> 41:20.008
Not guilty.

41:20.478 --> 41:22.708
Unlawful imprisonment?

41:22.780 --> 41:23.838
Not guilty.

41:24.181 --> 41:26.547
And Assault
in the Third Degree?

41:27.518 --> 41:28.746
Guilty.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.513
The defendant is free to go
until sentencing.

41:32.957 --> 41:34.424
Court is adjourned.

41:45.703 --> 41:48.536
Peter, I'm sorry
we didn't get them both.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.940
One's better than none.

41:56.280 --> 41:57.975
Congratulations, Counselor.

41:58.048 --> 41:59.640
You put up a good fight, AIex.

41:59.717 --> 42:03.414
Well, I didn't get the ruling
I wanted, but maybe next time.

42:14.164 --> 42:15.631
(REPORTERS CHATTERING)

42:15.699 --> 42:18.634
You're under arrest for
the murder of Sydney Green.

42:18.702 --> 42:21.330
I'II beat this charge, too,
Counselor. Just watch me.

42:21.405 --> 42:24.806
AII of your
courtroom knowledge
won't get you out of this one.

42:26.443 --> 42:28.240
MAN: How did this happen?

42:31.348 --> 42:34.749
Looks Iike next time's now.
Feel Iike bargaining
over a drink?

42:34.818 --> 42:37.048
My best offer is 25.

42:37.121 --> 42:39.089
Sixteen,
you can pick up the bar tab.

42:39.156 --> 42:41.556
That's crazy.
She'd be out in 12.
