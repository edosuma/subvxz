'cause this garbage
ain't gonna fly with me.

19:55.577 --> 19:59.129
You wanna go chase ghosts,
fine.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.715
But if you're gonna be here,
be here.

20:01.717 --> 20:04.501
Xavier wouldn't
kick you out,

20:04.503 --> 20:07.237
but don't think
for a second I won't.

20:07.239 --> 20:09.172
She's out there.
I know it.

20:09.174 --> 20:12.342
Then go look for her,
on your own.

20:12.344 --> 20:15.112
Because you're either one
of the team or you're gone.

20:15.114 --> 20:16.680
Now, which is it?

20:16.682 --> 20:18.649
[♪♪♪]

20:18.651 --> 20:20.450
I'll stay.

20:20.452 --> 20:21.936
What's that?

20:21.938 --> 20:25.172
It's over.
I'm staying here.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.974
Good.

20:39.186 --> 20:41.938
[WOMAN GASPS]

20:41.940 --> 20:44.308
Doctor. Doctor!

20:44.310 --> 20:45.959
Look, she's awake.

20:45.961 --> 20:48.678
Miss? Hello?

20:48.680 --> 20:50.581
How are you feeling?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.515
I'm tired,

20:52.517 --> 20:54.417
but I feel all right.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.686
Good. Can you
tell us your name?

20:56.688 --> 20:59.273
I--

20:59.275 --> 21:00.690
I don't know.

21:00.692 --> 21:02.625
I can't remember.

21:04.162 --> 21:06.563
