Narrator:
In New York City war on crime

00:08.775 --> 00:12.279
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:12.312 --> 00:13.985
of the Major Case Squad.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.015
These are their stories.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.358
(phone rings)

00:26.226 --> 00:28.263
Yes?

00:28.295 --> 00:30.275
Tonight?

00:33.133 --> 00:35.272
Call me when it's done.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.111
Thanks.

00:47.180 --> 00:49.160
So what's going on with this reporter?

00:49.182 --> 00:51.890
- You hear anything?
- He prints that garbage,

00:51.919 --> 00:53.489
you know we're screwed.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.659
Screw him, six ways to Sunday.

00:55.689 --> 00:57.828
He isn't printing anything.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.136
- Check this.
- Man on tape: Listen, you
self-satisfied jerkwad.

01:03.163 --> 01:06.474
- "Jerkwad"?
- You're a damn liar and your
paper's a piece of crap.

01:06.500 --> 01:10.778
You think you can get away with destroying
people's lives, you're wrong.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.579
You hurt us, we'll hurt you back.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.586
Goes to all the trouble of calling,

01:14.608 --> 01:16.986
you'd think he'd do better
than, "We'll hurt you back."

01:17.010 --> 01:20.014
- How you coming along?
- He got a threat.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.687
A threat? There something
you're not telling me?

01:22.716 --> 01:24.627
Might be.

01:24.651 --> 01:27.689
Take the weekend, but I expect a Pulitzer.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.658
Man: I don't know if I can.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.332
Okay, okay, HI be there.

01:34.361 --> 01:37.501
Where am I taking this guy, anyway?

01:37.531 --> 01:40.774
No, it's cool. I was just asking.

01:40.801 --> 01:44.112
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

01:44.137 --> 01:46.549
Hey, Phil, you coming to
Ruby's to watch the game?

01:46.573 --> 01:49.554
No. I got something else I gotta do.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.630
You looking for a rider?

02:02.656 --> 02:04.636
Yeah. I got a call.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.400
They didn't give me a name or nothing, but--

02:07.427 --> 02:09.872
You're gonna want to keep
your eyes on the road, guy.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.707
Oh, come on. It's couple of days.

02:15.736 --> 02:19.707
And then we could sneak off to Hilton Head.

02:19.740 --> 02:23.745
Oh, come on. My mom and
dad both like you a lot.

02:23.777 --> 02:26.849
The only people in America
still impressed by reporters.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.828
No, they like you in spite
of the fact you're a reporter.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.297
Thank you.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.926
Driver: Are we picking somebody up?

02:35.956 --> 02:37.993
Making a delivery or something?

02:38.025 --> 02:41.563
Rider: Yeah, something like that.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.597
Yeah, you just keep the motor running.

02:46.633 --> 02:49.671
- Mom is always saying, it ain't never gonna”
- ( shouts )

02:49.703 --> 02:51.910
(woman screams)

02:52.906 --> 02:55.352
- Get out of the way!
- ( screams )

03:01.615 --> 03:04.721
Oh my God. Oh my God.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.327
( theme music playing )

03:56.369 --> 03:58.280
Man: I'd just come out for a smoke.

03:58.305 --> 04:00.717
I wasn't really paying a 100% attention.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.585
The next thing I know,
some black guy is shooting.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.214
Did you get a look at him?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.350
Mostly I was looking at that gun.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.986
As soon as he's done shooting them,
he started waving it around.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.860
I thought-- I've never
been so scared in my life.

04:12.886 --> 04:14.593
Did you see him take off?

04:14.621 --> 04:17.101
Yeah. There was a car

04:17.124 --> 04:19.331
over there, across the street.

04:19.358 --> 04:21.999
He ran for it, and then they just
gunned out of here.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.769
Gunned? It had a lot of power?

04:23.797 --> 04:27.074
Yeah, a big red car--

04:27.100 --> 04:28.909
kind of vintage.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.973
Like...

04:32.005 --> 04:33.643
A "Starsky and Hutch" car?

04:33.673 --> 04:35.619
Yeah, like that. Detective?

04:35.642 --> 04:37.622
Okay.

04:37.644 --> 04:38.884
We got your number.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.791
We'll bring you in tomorrow to look
at some pictures. Thanks.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.056
- Yeah.
- Talk about had habits--

04:44.084 --> 04:46.530
Fried and his fiancé
ate here every Thursday.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.624
He even proposed to her here.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.799
You check how they fell?

04:53.827 --> 04:56.637
He shoved her behind him to protect her,

04:56.663 --> 04:59.439
only the shooter used a cannon at two feet.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.639
- Right though him.
- Twice.

05:01.668 --> 05:03.443
Shooter liked a lot of firepower.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.542
Probably pissed his letter to
the editor didn't get published.

05:06.573 --> 05:09.452
- This guy's a reporter?
- Derek Fried, "The Ledger."

05:09.476 --> 05:11.478
He did that big exposé last year

05:11.511 --> 05:12.956
on corruption in the 1-5.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.357
Where those nine cops lost
their badges, right?

05:15.382 --> 05:17.362
Jeez.

05:17.384 --> 05:19.455
Too had she had to get shot, too.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.274
Voice mail's been erased.

05:29.296 --> 05:30.969
But it was definitely a threat?

05:30.997 --> 05:32.999
"The Ledger's a lying piece of crap"

05:33.033 --> 05:35.411
and "We're going to hurt you."
That's what I heard.

05:35.435 --> 05:37.312
The caller say what he was mad about?

05:37.337 --> 05:40.181
- Not specific, no.
- Thank you, Bill. I'll take it from here.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.778
I'm Jason Richards, editor of the Metro desk.

05:42.809 --> 05:46.780
Until we get the ground rules straight with
1PP, Mr. Fried's files are off-limits.

05:46.813 --> 05:48.986
Could you step in here for a moment?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.858
Of course the Major Case Squad's
extremely capable.

05:53.887 --> 05:57.334
Nobody's trying to stop them
from doing their job.

05:57.357 --> 06:01.601
If you're barring my people from
investigating this guy's records,
it's the same thing.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.904
"The Ledger" has a right to exercise caution.

06:03.930 --> 06:07.241
Especially in light of this
reporter's history with the NYPD.

06:07.267 --> 06:10.805
If that's your concern, that material
can be excluded from the investigation.

06:10.837 --> 06:14.341
Your presumption being
a cop had nothing to do with this.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.478
My presumption being

06:15.508 --> 06:18.580
you're acting out of a genuine concern
for the First Amendment,

06:18.612 --> 06:22.025
not grandstanding to boost your circulation.

06:26.653 --> 06:30.260
- How about the Impala?
- The lines were different. Rounder.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.431
- How about this one?
- The body's right...

06:33.460 --> 06:36.168
The paint job was new. Same with the tires.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.040
But the grille here and
the back bumper were missing.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.068
- Great, thanks.
- Yeah.

06:44.471 --> 06:48.613
Eames, I got to see a buddy about
a '71 Malibu. You want to come?

06:48.642 --> 06:51.020
Sure. I love meeting your buddies.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.322
That wrench has got to be here.

06:56.349 --> 07:00.024
I know I had it when I dropped the tranny
on that Mustang coupe.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.397
I still can't get used
to seeing you in a suit.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.333
It's a '71 Malibu, Lewis.

07:04.357 --> 07:07.634
A getaway car in a shooting.
The owner's restoring it.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.708
The owner of the Malibu

07:11.731 --> 07:14.439
still hasn't nailed down the grille
or the rear bumper.

07:14.467 --> 07:17.778
Bring back any memories, Bobby?

07:17.804 --> 07:20.045
- Whew.
- Hey, about that Malibu,

07:20.073 --> 07:22.485
I got a call from Reggie in Yonkers.

07:22.509 --> 07:25.046
He's got a friend who was
looking to score a grille from that year.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.422
You want, I can get the guy's name.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.154
That would be great.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.025
351 four-barrel.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.327
Who you trying to outrun?

07:33.353 --> 07:37.267
Whoa. I think I'm in love.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.767
(siren wails)

07:41.795 --> 07:43.035
Ahh!

07:43.063 --> 07:45.407
Give it up, garbage boy!

07:45.432 --> 07:48.902
- What'd I do?
- You got yourself arrested, Phil.

07:50.403 --> 07:53.179
I got it. Full count.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.413
Five grand.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.388
Hey, is that Davy?

07:57.410 --> 08:00.050
Yeah, tell him I got something for him.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.856
Yeah. A puzzle.

08:02.882 --> 08:05.328
Okay. Yeah.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.357
Okay, next stop Crown Heights.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.095
Right.

08:10.123 --> 08:13.161
I am completely innocent in this thing.

08:13.193 --> 08:16.572
We've got your car as the
getaway in a double homicide.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.270
That's a long way from innocence, Phil.

08:19.299 --> 08:22.246
I admit to nothing.

08:26.806 --> 08:29.047
I'm really impressed with that car, Phil.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.453
It's a work of art.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.856
- It's not finished.
- Well, it's getting there.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.121
4-11 SS, Turbo-Jet V-8.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.322
I've seen some of them go
for close to $30 grand.

08:38.351 --> 08:41.525
I have to ask myself,

08:41.554 --> 08:44.865
Why would Phil put a sweet vehicle like that

08:44.891 --> 08:47.303
anyplace near where shots
are going to be thrown?

08:50.296 --> 08:52.242
L-- I wouldn't.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.938
Right.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.914
The answer has to be that you didn't know.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.482
Had you known a hit like
that was going down,

09:00.507 --> 09:02.384
you would've used a different car.

09:03.843 --> 09:06.187
Right, right. I didn't know.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.749
Well, how'd you put yourself
in a position like that?

09:08.782 --> 09:12.195
Driving someone to do a hit
you didn't even know about?

09:12.218 --> 09:14.255
Was it this gambling thing we heard about?

09:14.287 --> 09:16.130
You got yourself all jammed up?

09:20.326 --> 09:22.272
I don't have any choice in it...

09:22.295 --> 09:24.206
When they ask me to do these things.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.232
Who asks you? Your bookie?

09:26.266 --> 09:28.746
No, he's gone. Long gone.

09:28.768 --> 09:31.510
He sold the debt, so now they just call me.

09:31.538 --> 09:33.882
- Who?
- I don't know who!

09:33.907 --> 09:37.150
And I can't say no. You
can't say no to these people.

09:40.013 --> 09:43.586
Oh God, I'm going to go to jail
for a real long time now, aren't I?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.857
( sobbing )

09:49.989 --> 09:53.300
Goren: You can help yourself by helping us.

09:54.661 --> 09:56.732
The guy you drove, the shooter...

09:59.065 --> 10:01.238
Could you pick him out of a mug book?

10:04.938 --> 10:08.681
Get the goldfish. Good.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.210
Woman: It's about time, baby.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.484
I never thought a bed
was going to open up for you.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.788
- ( dog barking )
- Wait. Shh!

10:14.814 --> 10:17.420
- Come on.
- ( shouting )

10:17.450 --> 10:19.327
Don't move! Get down, ma'am, get down!

10:19.352 --> 10:21.832
- Get down, get down!
- I got her!

10:24.791 --> 10:25.861
(gun cocks)

10:25.892 --> 10:27.428
Put it down, Greg.

10:29.929 --> 10:31.738
Go. Go.

10:36.369 --> 10:39.839
It's all right, kid.
Your dad's going to be fine.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.425
Isn't that right, Greg?

11:03.596 --> 11:05.041
It's going to be all right, son.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.839
Daddy's okay.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.938
Keep that positive attitude, Greg.

11:09.969 --> 11:13.007
- You're going to need it where you're going.
- I'm okay, son.

11:20.246 --> 11:21.919
Eames: That cannon of yours

11:21.948 --> 11:25.521
matches the slugs they dug out
of the reporter and his fiancé.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.998
Long and short of it,
Gregory, you're dead meat.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.797
I don't want my son going to Social Services.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.099
You call my mother, she'll come pick him up.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.799
Her name's Sandra Generet.

11:34.827 --> 11:36.966
She works in the 12th
Assembly District's office

11:36.996 --> 11:38.407
down by the Fulton Mall.

11:38.431 --> 11:41.105
- You're not listening, Greg.
- No, you're not listening.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.080
I don't want my son in a foster home

11:43.102 --> 11:45.582
'cause I know what goes on down there.

11:45.605 --> 11:49.018
Now, go call my mother.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.725
Sandra, right?

12:06.926 --> 12:10.669
You don't want your boy going down the
same road you're on. I understand that.

12:19.138 --> 12:20.845
This is you four years ago.

12:20.873 --> 12:23.046
You were a transit cop.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.147
What happened to this guy?

12:28.481 --> 12:31.621
The crack pipe we found
in your crib, is that what happened?

12:33.519 --> 12:35.590
You know that driver?

12:35.622 --> 12:37.966
He's all jammed up on a gambling thing.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.232
That's how they got to him.

12:41.694 --> 12:45.198
How did these people get to you?

12:46.532 --> 12:49.308
Your drugs?

12:49.335 --> 12:52.179
- Your kid?
- I should've shot you when I had the chance.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.344
I've heard that.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.649
Have you heard this one?

12:58.678 --> 13:00.658
That a man's family

13:00.680 --> 13:03.388
serves his time with him?

13:04.951 --> 13:08.023
It's up to you what kind of life
you want for your boy.

13:08.054 --> 13:11.058
Well, right now what I want is a lawyer.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.375
Well?

13:19.866 --> 13:22.176
I can't get ahold of my guy.

13:22.201 --> 13:23.839
What do you mean?

13:23.870 --> 13:25.372
I think he's been pinched.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.444
- How much does he know?
- He only knows me.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.354
I told him he'd be taken care of,
anything went wrong.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.517
I hope you can still back that up.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.618
This is a damn disaster.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.892
This can't work its way up the ladder.
You understand that, don't you?

13:39.919 --> 13:43.162
It won't, Larry, long as
people get taken care of.

13:43.189 --> 13:45.066
Damn it!

13:48.027 --> 13:50.667
He's running on the assumption
the boy's safer

13:50.697 --> 13:52.438
if he keeps his mouth shut.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.604
Good assumption. What about the girlfriend?

13:54.634 --> 13:57.274
She'd be a great witness
if she knew anything.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.340
We checked his work record.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.478
Strictly transit. No connection
to the 1-5, past or present.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.084
"The Ledger" sent over

14:05.111 --> 14:07.717
drafts of articles Fried was working on.

14:07.747 --> 14:10.227
Road rage, high school gambling.

14:10.249 --> 14:13.253
My pick of the week, shakedowns
in the garbage industry.

14:13.286 --> 14:16.699
Phil the driver, he
hauls garbage for a living.

14:16.723 --> 14:19.203
Fried's article mentions one company.

14:22.929 --> 14:24.875
The mob's been out of garbage five years.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.275
Everybody wants to believe we're still crooks.

14:27.300 --> 14:31.077
- The allegations in Mr. Fried's article?
- A bunch of lying crap.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.583
"Lying crap."

14:32.605 --> 14:36.644
That's exactly what the guy said
on Fried's voice mail.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.849
It must be garbage industry jargon.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.551
I never threatened anybody.

14:40.580 --> 14:44.050
Here's some police jargon
for you, Mr. Salazzo-- voice print.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.825
We can match that threatening
message to your voice,

14:46.853 --> 14:48.355
just like a fingerprint.

14:50.556 --> 14:54.094
Okay, if I said something like that
to Fried, it wasn't a real sort of thing.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.936
Eames: What sort of "thing" was it?

14:55.962 --> 14:59.409
It was for show. Fried was asking
around about the shakedowns.

14:59.432 --> 15:03.881
People were upset, and I had to
let them know I was upset too.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.041
You were his source?

15:07.106 --> 15:09.211
It was going to come out anyway.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.279
This way, maybe I buy myself some goodwill

15:11.310 --> 15:13.051
when he finally prints something.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.319
Who put out the hit?

15:14.347 --> 15:17.590
I don't know. And that's the God's truth.

15:17.617 --> 15:21.895
4 of us have been getting together to work
out how these shakedowns are going to happen,

15:21.921 --> 15:23.559
and I gave Fried their names.

15:28.428 --> 15:32.433
I don't work for the garbage
hauler's union, I consult.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.945
What does that mean, "consult"?

15:36.436 --> 15:40.077
I advise them on a lot of different situations.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.847
You know what "consult" means.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.854
Any idea why your name came up in connection

15:43.876 --> 15:46.857
with an article about this situation
with the garbage company?

15:46.879 --> 15:49.052
Situation? I'm not sure what you mean by that.

15:49.081 --> 15:52.392
- You don't know what "situation" means?
- The shakedown, Mr. Nawrocki.

15:52.418 --> 15:53.897
On the level?

15:53.920 --> 15:56.457
I thought it was something that the union

15:56.489 --> 15:59.834
should not participate in
but also not interfere with.

15:59.859 --> 16:01.930
That's the advice I gave them.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.033
And that's why this exposé by
Mr. Fried did not concern me.

16:05.064 --> 16:07.874
- Now I got to get to a meeting.
- That's a nice tie-pin.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.471
What is that, emblem for the Fulton Mall?

16:10.503 --> 16:12.744
Yeah.

16:12.772 --> 16:17.243
"12" What is that? Lucky number, or--

16:17.276 --> 16:20.314
Right. A lucky number.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.326
Nice talking to you.

16:26.452 --> 16:28.489
12th Assembly District office.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.330
The one Greg's Mom works in.

16:30.356 --> 16:33.701
I know my son has caused
a lot of pain to people.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.637
Goren: We're not here because of Greg.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.574
Grandma's got oranges for you.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.407
Here.

16:41.467 --> 16:44.880
We're here because of a man named
Joe Nawrocki. Do you know him?

16:44.904 --> 16:48.818
Mr. Nawrocki was doing
fundraising for district elections

16:48.841 --> 16:51.617
when I started working here 20 years ago.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.180
Eames: When Greg was a teenager?

16:53.212 --> 16:56.056
We pulled Greg's application
for the police department.

16:56.082 --> 16:59.757
Mr. Nawrocki was listed as a reference.

16:59.785 --> 17:02.425
Mr. Nawrocki helps a lot of people.

17:03.656 --> 17:07.160
Especially your son. Davy, look.

17:07.193 --> 17:11.300
It's your daddy when he
was in uniform at the police academy.

17:11.329 --> 17:13.810
Now, who's he with here? It's Mr. Nawrocki--

17:13.833 --> 17:16.814
and shaking hands with the governor.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.281
What's that, about 1994?

17:19.305 --> 17:21.808
Governor came through on a campaign swing?

17:21.840 --> 17:24.117
They took rookies right out of the academy

17:24.143 --> 17:25.816
to do security detail.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.915
No.

17:27.946 --> 17:30.325
They didn't send just any rookie.

17:30.349 --> 17:34.092
Those security details were handpicked
by local party bosses.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.991
Very big deal for a young officer.

17:44.063 --> 17:48.307
Mr. Nawrocki was a very close friend of yours,

17:48.334 --> 17:50.336
wasn't he?

17:52.939 --> 17:55.886
Yes, at one time. Yes.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.320
When's the last time he called?

17:59.512 --> 18:01.617
A couple of weeks ago.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.753
He wanted to know how Gregory was doing,

18:04.784 --> 18:07.025
if he was still on drugs.

18:07.053 --> 18:09.624
And you thought he wanted to help him,

18:09.655 --> 18:11.794
like before.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.094
Didn't you?

18:21.767 --> 18:24.008
I told him where he was.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.952
Oh, God! ( sobbing )

18:34.747 --> 18:37.193
What did he talk my boy into?

18:38.918 --> 18:41.364
My client has nothing to say.

18:41.387 --> 18:45.358
Who's paying the bills for this
bozo, Greg? Joe Nawrocki?

18:45.391 --> 18:47.371
He's my lawyer. That's all you need to know.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.464
If he's telling you not to make a statement,

18:49.495 --> 18:51.270
he's Nawrocki's lawyer.

18:51.297 --> 18:54.278
Unless you've got a death wish, Mr. Generet,

18:54.300 --> 18:56.177
a statement's your only way to go.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.840
All right, we're done here.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.907
Goren: We talked to your mother.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.419
She lent us the photo.

19:02.441 --> 19:04.387
She keeps it on her desk.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.856
The proud moment in her son's life.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.917
Yeah? Well, the moment's gone.

19:09.949 --> 19:12.395
Eames: Your mother still has faith in you.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.898
That's why she gave Nawrocki
your phone number.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.025
Goren: She thought that he
was trying to help you.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.969
Instead, he got you into this mess.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.302
And now you're trying

19:22.328 --> 19:24.365
to keep it from swallowing up your family.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.399
Talk, don't talk. It doesn't matter.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.537
These people, whoever they are,

19:28.567 --> 19:31.707
will eventually get around
to you, your mother,

19:31.737 --> 19:36.117
or anyone else who can tie
them to these murders.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.888
( buzzing )

19:40.913 --> 19:43.052
My mom and son, what are you offering them?

19:43.082 --> 19:45.722
State witness protection program?

19:45.751 --> 19:49.255
You might as well buy them
a plot at Woodlawn.

19:49.288 --> 19:51.063
Yeah, you got that right.

19:51.090 --> 19:54.435
But I knew people-- people in the Fed.

19:58.230 --> 20:00.938
People that owe me favors.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.516
I can get someone in so deep,

20:06.539 --> 20:08.780
even I couldn't find them.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.290
Someplace good.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.420
They need a life, and they
need to be safe, both.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.491
- Wait a minute, you're not buying this?
- I can do that.

20:23.522 --> 20:25.365
- You give me your word?
- I give you my word.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.429
- You should be getting immunity.
- Not for two murders.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.175
- They're giving you noth--
- Man, just--

20:41.073 --> 20:43.576
Nawrocki promised me 10 grand...

20:45.611 --> 20:47.386
And a bed in a rehab.

20:49.048 --> 20:52.029
He made me the last of the payment
the day before I got arrested.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.563
Did he say why he wanted the reporter dead?

20:58.257 --> 21:00.362
No. Just said I'd be doing a public service.

21:00.392 --> 21:02.736
A public service for who?

21:12.938 --> 21:14.918
The governor.

21:23.816 --> 21:27.525
Public service? This crackhead's
got a hell of an imagination.

21:27.553 --> 21:31.831
He didn't imagine the calls he and
his mother got from your client.

21:31.857 --> 21:34.736
We have the phone records right here.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.501
See?

21:36.529 --> 21:40.067
Mr. Nawrocki has a soft spot for
the family. He doesn't deny it.

21:40.099 --> 21:42.739
So the $10 grand, the rehab bed,

21:42.768 --> 21:46.773
that was just his big heart
reaching out to a fallen local hero.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.615
He doesn't know anything about any money.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.588
It came in the same package
as this kid's puzzle.

21:58.017 --> 22:00.361
You see these smudges here?

22:01.287 --> 22:03.597
That's where they found your fingerprints.

22:04.456 --> 22:06.197
It was real thoughtful of you,

22:06.225 --> 22:07.966
giving the kid a gift

22:07.993 --> 22:12.203
to keep his mind off his dad
sitting on death row because of you.

22:12.231 --> 22:15.542
It had nothing to do with garbage,
did it, Mr. Nawrocki?

22:15.568 --> 22:18.640
It's bigger. And Derek Fried got too close.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.242
He didn't even know what he had.

22:21.273 --> 22:25.050
But I guess with his record
for sniffing out corruption,

22:25.077 --> 22:27.717
you and whoever pulls your strings

22:27.746 --> 22:29.623
didn't want to take any chances

22:29.648 --> 22:32.959
that it'd come back and bite
this big boy on the ass!

22:32.985 --> 22:35.329
Lawyer: You can tell the
"wizards" behind the glass

22:35.354 --> 22:37.630
this'll never survive a motion to dismiss.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.461
Boo! Made you look.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.708
This is big. Very big.

22:49.735 --> 22:51.715
According to a drug addict.

22:53.239 --> 22:55.185
You don't think he was involved?

22:55.207 --> 22:57.881
I do. I just don't think it goes beyond him.

22:57.910 --> 23:01.824
What, did you vote for the governor?

23:01.847 --> 23:04.453
I take it you didn't. But then again,

23:04.483 --> 23:07.760
that wouldn't influence
your judgment, would it?

23:07.786 --> 23:09.732
I didn't vote for the guy either.

23:09.755 --> 23:13.168
But I like my job, and I'm not ready to
start lobbing charges toward Albany.

23:13.192 --> 23:16.105
I like my job too, but this is going
to go where it's going to go.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.540
It's not going anywhere unless we have

23:18.564 --> 23:21.670
corroborating evidence against Mr. Nawrocki.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.237
Until then, I'm not going near a grand jury.

23:30.209 --> 23:33.850
He's got a dozen accounts in here
with banks all over the city.

23:33.879 --> 23:37.554
- Mr. Nawrocki takes a car service
everywhere he goes?
- Yes.

23:37.583 --> 23:38.721
Do you have invoices?

23:38.751 --> 23:42.164
We're interested in his rides
on Thursday the 24th.

23:42.187 --> 23:44.292
This is for last month.

23:44.323 --> 23:46.929
- Here, let me highlight it for you.
- It's okay.

23:46.959 --> 23:50.031
The search warrant doesn't
actually stipulate highlighting.

23:52.498 --> 23:55.877
Okay, I got a car trip to Crown Heights.

23:55.901 --> 23:57.403
Our old friend Gregory.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.440
There's a stop along the
way at 402 West 57th.

24:00.472 --> 24:02.748
- A bank?
- Not a bank listed in here.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.381
You know this address?

24:06.412 --> 24:09.222
West 57th. That's Mr. Wiegert.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.228
Wiegert. Wiegert.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.958
You're thinking of Louise Wiegert.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.590
Who's Louise Wiegert?

24:15.621 --> 24:17.532
The maiden name of the governor's wife.

24:17.556 --> 24:20.594
Larry Wiegert's the
governor's brother-in-law.

24:20.626 --> 24:23.368
Man: Larry, I hope there's no problem here.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.807
Woman: Honey, after everything
we've accomplished,

24:25.831 --> 24:28.505
it would be a shame to rush things at the end.

24:28.534 --> 24:31.242
I've been waiting four years.
This is hardly a rush.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.715
Pick up the phone, Larry.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.347
- Yeah?
- Tell me this isn't about that reporter.

24:37.376 --> 24:40.414
It is and it isn't. I can assure you

24:40.446 --> 24:43.825
they have absolutely nothing
that's going to...

24:43.849 --> 24:45.487
Connect us to anything, but--

24:45.517 --> 24:49.192
You know the regard I have for you,
and I'm fortunate you took this on,

24:49.221 --> 24:52.168
because the work you've done
with the governor's been stunning.

24:52.191 --> 24:55.434
But this is getting frustrating,
and I don't like being frustrated.

24:55.461 --> 24:57.805
It's a precaution.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.276
I wouldn't even be bringing it up otherwise.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.779
I know you'll come through.
Put Stephanie on, please.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.377
He wants to talk to you.

25:06.405 --> 25:08.385
Hi, sweetheart.

25:08.407 --> 25:11.013
Hi, baby. I can't wait to see you.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.080
I can't either.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.649
But it would make me crazy
if you came back now

25:15.681 --> 25:17.217
and something went wrong.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.160
It'll work out. How are the boys?

25:19.184 --> 25:22.063
They're fine. They miss you--

25:22.087 --> 25:24.033
Tommy especially.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.730
He says your name every day, he cries.

25:26.759 --> 25:29.069
I don't know what to tell him anymore.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.973
I've got to go now, Stephanie.
Tell them I love them?

25:33.132 --> 25:35.339
I will.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.005
Bye.

25:41.173 --> 25:44.120
I just got off the phone with my friend
from the phone company.

25:44.143 --> 25:47.647
He tells me you pulled the phone records
for the governor's brother-in-law.

25:47.679 --> 25:49.886
He and Nawrocki
have been trading phone calls.

25:49.915 --> 25:53.590
That's great. But something like
this you clear with me first.

25:53.619 --> 25:57.533
Wiegert and Nawrocki had a bunch of calls
last November and December,

25:57.556 --> 26:01.504
a couple of calls in January,
and then nothing until four weeks ago.

26:01.527 --> 26:05.134
Just around the same time Fried started
nosing around the garbage shakedowns.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.905
What do you make of this? Last December,

26:06.932 --> 26:09.242
Wiegert and Nawrocki both made calls

26:09.268 --> 26:11.475
to the Development Office
of Pelham University.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.676
Development? isn't that the Ivy League word

26:13.705 --> 26:15.742
for hitting people up for money?

26:17.309 --> 26:20.916
Woman: Mr. Wiegert and Mr.
Nawrocki coordinated a contribution

26:20.946 --> 26:23.324
from a major donor last December.

26:23.348 --> 26:25.191
I hope there isn't a problem.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.959
Shouldn't be. What was
the contribution for?

26:27.986 --> 26:29.988
A school of government. A new building,

26:30.022 --> 26:32.935
3 chairs, a library-- it's a huge project.

26:32.958 --> 26:35.370
Who's the lucky person that
gets their name above the door?

26:35.394 --> 26:36.964
The governor, actually.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.610
Oh, there is something wrong, isn't there?

26:40.632 --> 26:42.134
How much was the donation?

26:42.167 --> 26:45.046
$750,000.

26:45.070 --> 26:47.880
- And who was the donor?
- It's anonymous.

26:47.906 --> 26:50.409
Mr. Nawrocki brought me a cashier's check,

26:50.442 --> 26:52.422
which I deposited with the understanding

26:52.444 --> 26:54.253
I was not to record where it came from.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.919
The donor doesn't want to end
up on every charity hit list.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.259
That's usually the reason.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.924
But three quarters of a million dollars--

27:01.954 --> 27:03.797
It's-- isn't that someone

27:03.822 --> 27:06.530
you'd want to say hello to
every now and then?

27:07.893 --> 27:10.533
I try to honor requests for privacy.

27:12.197 --> 27:15.440
You don't keep a little list
of anonymous donors,

27:15.467 --> 27:20.439
the ones with the deep pockets,
just for a rainy day?

27:23.976 --> 27:27.651
When I give money, I don't
like to call attention to it.

27:27.679 --> 27:29.955
Then everybody comes to you
with their hands out.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.524
How did you hear about the School
of Government, Ms. Thomas?

27:37.556 --> 27:39.797
Mr. Wiegert is a family friend

27:39.825 --> 27:41.361
and he told me about it.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.373
I've always been a fan of the governor's,

27:43.395 --> 27:45.773
so it was something I wanted to do.

27:45.797 --> 27:48.437
And how do you know Mr. Nawrocki?

27:50.002 --> 27:53.449
Nawrocki? I don't know anyone by that name.

27:53.472 --> 27:56.078
Look, is there a problem
with the contribution?

27:56.108 --> 28:01.023
Not as long as you've filled out
the relevant tax forms.

28:01.046 --> 28:02.957
You have kids.

28:02.981 --> 28:05.086
Three boys. They're a handful.

28:05.117 --> 28:07.324
"Tommy U." What does the U stand for?

28:07.352 --> 28:09.025
Oh, that's my husband's name.

28:09.054 --> 28:10.795
I'm separated.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.003
Ufland.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.206
You use your maiden name.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.643
Where's your husband now?

28:21.667 --> 28:24.807
Traveling. I really don't keep track.

28:30.175 --> 28:32.177
This one's by Ricky Junior.

28:39.851 --> 28:41.922
It's a cute name.

28:41.954 --> 28:45.128
Thank you for your help, Ms. Thomas.

28:45.157 --> 28:48.434
If we think of anything else,
we'll give you a call.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.133
We can find our way out.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.280
Eames: Ufland, Richard, financier,
tax consultant.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.511
- Great, another consultant.
- Read, read.

29:01.540 --> 29:04.646
1996, indicted for money laundering.

29:04.676 --> 29:08.214
He was cleaning money for a couple
of drug gangs in Spanish Harlem. Go on.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.421
Pleaded not guilty at arraignment.
Bail of $2 million.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.624
Failure to appear.
Declared a fugitive in 1997.

29:14.653 --> 29:17.896
- I guess that qualifies as traveling.
- Scroll down.

29:18.857 --> 29:21.701
Eames: Pardoned by the governor.

29:21.727 --> 29:23.468
Pardoned.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.600
When?

29:25.631 --> 29:28.009
January of this year.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.477
He was pardoned nearly six months ago.

29:33.505 --> 29:36.008
Was everybody asleep?
How come it never made the papers?

29:36.041 --> 29:38.954
Under state law, the governor's under
no obligation to announce it

29:38.977 --> 29:40.513
till the very last day of the year.

29:40.545 --> 29:43.617
When everyone's too busy partying
with Dick Clark to pay attention.

29:43.649 --> 29:47.426
By then, this three quarter of a million
dollar bribe's ancient history.

29:47.452 --> 29:50.661
Let me just play devil's advocate
for a fraction of a second.

29:50.689 --> 29:53.431
Is it possible the governor didn't know?

29:53.458 --> 29:55.438
Richard Ufland was a money manager

29:55.460 --> 29:59.340
for 2 drug gangs responsible for 37 deaths.

29:59.364 --> 30:02.368
We have financial documents
and sworn affidavits

30:02.401 --> 30:06.372
detailing the depth and
breadth of Ufland's criminality.

30:06.405 --> 30:09.579
If you're suggesting he was pardoned
on the merits, the answer is no.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.851
If you had such strong evidence,
why couldn't you get him extradited?

30:12.878 --> 30:16.690
Certain countries don't think money
laundering is a crime worth prosecuting.

30:16.715 --> 30:19.286
Did Ufland's wife know what he was doing?

30:19.318 --> 30:20.991
As far as we could tell, she didn't,

30:21.019 --> 30:22.965
and we looked very closely.

30:22.988 --> 30:24.968
The question is, what does she know now?

30:24.990 --> 30:26.435
If she's ready to talk,

30:26.458 --> 30:30.031
tell her that I have no interest
in putting her in jail.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.398
I don't care how it looks.

30:33.432 --> 30:36.072
That contribution had nothing
to do with my husband.

30:36.101 --> 30:38.672
- Where did the money come from?
- From me.

30:38.704 --> 30:40.911
I think she's answered enough questions.

30:40.939 --> 30:43.579
Wouldn't that money be
better spent on your kids?

30:43.608 --> 30:45.884
We set up a trust fund
for them a long time ago.

30:45.911 --> 30:47.822
They're fine. That's good.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.793
'Cause I assume his accounts
were frozen once he was arrested.

30:50.816 --> 30:53.422
- Yes.
- After he fled the country,

30:53.452 --> 30:57.229
how did you manage? You had
a co-op on 5th Avenue.

30:57.255 --> 30:59.531
I sold it. I couldn't afford the maintenance.

30:59.558 --> 31:02.437
Even so, it must've been tough on your kids--

31:02.461 --> 31:06.136
losing their home, deserted by their father--

31:06.164 --> 31:08.906
- Richard has not deserted--
- Wherever he is,

31:08.934 --> 31:11.312
he's not living in a two-bedroom walk-up.

31:11.336 --> 31:13.646
He is a good father.

31:13.672 --> 31:16.619
I know people despise him,
but I can't help that.

31:16.641 --> 31:19.485
I'm doing what I have to do to
keep my family together.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.047
Goren: I respect that.

31:21.079 --> 31:24.060
I'm just telling you, plain as I
know how, this investigation

31:24.082 --> 31:26.358
is going to take its course.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.025
You're the only one caring for those kids.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.056
If you go to jail, what happens to them?

31:31.089 --> 31:33.695
Wait. I--

31:33.725 --> 31:35.796
I can't go to jail.

31:35.827 --> 31:38.569
Okay...

31:38.597 --> 31:41.976
What kind of consideration
are we talking about here?

31:42.000 --> 31:45.504
The DA said they're not eager
to send her to jail.

31:47.139 --> 31:49.813
So immunity? Probation?

31:49.841 --> 31:52.219
Something like that--

31:52.244 --> 31:54.451
if they like what they hear.

31:59.017 --> 32:01.054
(sighs)

32:04.823 --> 32:07.303
Larry Wiegert came up to me at a party.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.941
He said he knew about my situation...

32:11.963 --> 32:14.603
and maybe could help.

32:14.633 --> 32:17.637
A few weeks later, he called me

32:17.669 --> 32:21.276
and said that he'd spoken
to the governor's chief of staff.

32:21.306 --> 32:23.252
Eames: Roy Fitzgerald?

32:23.275 --> 32:25.585
The story was,

32:25.610 --> 32:29.786
if I gave a contribution
to this school for the governor,

32:29.815 --> 32:32.125
that would just...

32:32.150 --> 32:34.027
Be a good thing to do.

32:36.021 --> 32:38.592
Larry said that he needed two checks.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.399
One for $750,000,

32:41.426 --> 32:44.134
and the other for $250,000
for his commission.

32:45.263 --> 32:47.243
I had no choice.

32:47.265 --> 32:49.541
Did your money come from your husband?

32:49.568 --> 32:52.310
No. We never told Richard

32:52.337 --> 32:55.079
until the pardon came through.

32:55.106 --> 32:58.918
And then he was supposed
to fly back this month,

32:58.944 --> 33:00.753
but something went wrong.

33:00.779 --> 33:03.760
Larry and Richard have been
on the phone talking about it.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.388
I don't know what it is, but it sounds bad.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.659
A reporter started investigating

33:08.687 --> 33:11.167
Mr. Wiegert's bag man, Joe Nawrocki.

33:11.189 --> 33:14.363
That reporter and his fiancé
were gunned down 2 weeks ago.

33:19.965 --> 33:22.104
Oh, you don't think...?

33:26.938 --> 33:28.975
Oh God.

33:35.914 --> 33:39.225
This is the last time I'm going
to be able to talk to you, Larry.

33:39.251 --> 33:41.492
I can't take your calls anymore.

33:42.888 --> 33:46.097
What? I did this all by myself,
is that the position?

33:46.124 --> 33:49.333
The governor's office had
no knowledge of illegal activity.

33:51.096 --> 33:53.007
Look, Roy, I need to talk to my sister.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.638
- She doesn't want to talk to you.
- I need to talk to her and the governor.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.239
They are not available to you.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.648
Not available. That's perfect.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.120
I'll be making a statement
to the District Attorney.

34:05.143 --> 34:06.781
I'll bet you will

34:06.811 --> 34:08.813
About how I was acting on my own,

34:08.847 --> 34:12.021
and this pardon just happened
on its own as well, right?

34:12.050 --> 34:15.190
I advised the governor
the petition had merit.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.460
He was acting solely on my advice.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.935
That's what happened.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.402
Goodbye, Larry.

34:21.426 --> 34:24.873
What about me? What do I do?

34:26.331 --> 34:28.436
What am I supposed to do now?

34:33.638 --> 34:37.108
Mr. Wiegert called from his
car 15 minutes ago.

34:37.141 --> 34:39.485
He said he was on his way back.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.786
Wiegert golfing with the governor?

34:41.813 --> 34:43.382
Where'd they get those pants?

34:44.382 --> 34:46.726
- Goren: This picture old?
- About seven years.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.322
- They still golf together?
- No, they don't.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.300
- Governor's too busy?
- ( elevator bell rings )

34:51.322 --> 34:54.998
They didn't even bother to show up for Mr.
Wiegert's wedding three years ago.

34:55.025 --> 34:57.027
I mean, there's busy and there's busy.

34:57.062 --> 35:00.168
Mr. Wiegert, these detectives
are here to see you.

35:00.198 --> 35:03.236
- Of course they are.
- You're under arrest, Mr. Wiegert.

35:04.502 --> 35:07.847
Cynthia, could you call Jacqueline Roscoe
and tell her to meet us at...

35:07.872 --> 35:10.478
Major Case Squad,
One Police Plaza, 11th floor.

35:13.244 --> 35:15.246
Let's put it over there.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.828
Sorry to keep you waiting.
We were watching the news.

35:20.852 --> 35:24.390
Your little sister had
to make a statement to the press.

35:24.422 --> 35:26.493
Carver: Let's get down to business.

35:26.524 --> 35:28.595
My client declines to make a statement.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.834
He's not counting on his
sister or her husband

35:30.862 --> 35:33.069
calling the Attorney General
on his behalf, is he?

35:36.601 --> 35:38.308
This is your sister's

35:38.336 --> 35:40.816
press conference this afternoon.

35:43.008 --> 35:45.955
The governor and I had no
knowledge of his activities.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.615
I love my brother

35:47.646 --> 35:50.422
and I hope these allegations aren't true.

35:51.416 --> 35:54.727
But right now, I'm very disappointed in Larry.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.628
You broker a payoff to
this School of Government,

36:03.662 --> 36:06.768
this monument to her husband's legacy

36:06.798 --> 36:08.607
and she's disappointed.

36:08.633 --> 36:11.637
I repeat, he's not making a statement here.

36:11.670 --> 36:15.117
Tomorrow, they'll still be living
in the governor's mansion,

36:15.140 --> 36:18.383
maybe planning a run for something bigger.

36:20.512 --> 36:23.493
Richard Ufland's pardon's irrevocable.

36:23.515 --> 36:26.462
But you-- you, Larry?

36:26.484 --> 36:28.623
You're the punch line.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.295
Just like...

36:33.324 --> 36:35.634
Billy Carter, Donald Nixon,

36:35.660 --> 36:39.938
Roger Clinton, you're an embarrassment.

36:39.964 --> 36:43.935
Right now, I'm very disappointed in Larry.

36:43.968 --> 36:46.141
Goren: Look at her.

36:46.171 --> 36:49.914
She has no shame at all.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.886
Your little sister,

36:55.914 --> 36:59.020
who couldn't even be bothered
to show up at your wedding.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.859
- They were busy.
- Doing what?

37:00.885 --> 37:03.456
Dedicating an overpass on the Taconic?

37:03.488 --> 37:05.559
Why do you make excuses for them?

37:06.758 --> 37:09.261
Right now, I'm very disappointed in Larry.

37:09.294 --> 37:12.241
- Stop it.
- So you're good enough to hustle
bribes for them,

37:12.263 --> 37:14.800
but you're not good enough to shoot
18 holes with the big guy.

37:14.833 --> 37:17.575
That wasn't her, that was him. He decided.

37:17.602 --> 37:20.583
What he decided I don't know,
but suddenly I was off the list.

37:20.605 --> 37:23.142
- She could've stood up to him.
- Louise has to go along.

37:23.174 --> 37:26.212
Right now, I'm very disappointed in Larry.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.121
All right!

37:28.146 --> 37:30.217
That's not going along, Larry.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.989
That's sticking it to ya!

37:32.016 --> 37:33.825
I bet they weren't disappointed

37:33.852 --> 37:36.355
when you brought them
Stephanie Ufland's check.

37:36.387 --> 37:38.765
No.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.997
- No, no, no, they weren't.
- Larry--

37:41.025 --> 37:44.336
Why should I protect them? Have
they given me any reason why?!

37:47.632 --> 37:49.441
An right.

37:49.467 --> 37:51.970
Yeah, I went to the big guy

37:52.003 --> 37:54.142
and told him what Stephanie wanted.

37:54.172 --> 37:56.448
And he sent me to his chief of staff--

37:56.474 --> 37:58.715
to Roy Fitzgerald.

37:58.743 --> 38:01.246
The governor understood
there was a quid pro quo?

38:01.279 --> 38:03.054
The money in return for the pardon?

38:03.081 --> 38:05.391
It wouldn't have happened otherwise.

38:05.416 --> 38:06.986
And Mr. Fried's murder?

38:07.018 --> 38:11.125
No, that they did not know.
Not at all. That was Ufland.

38:11.156 --> 38:14.694
I told Ufland that Fried was
investigating Nawrocki.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.434
And Ufland wasn't one to be
pardoned for laundering money

38:17.462 --> 38:19.408
only to be arrested for bribery.

38:19.430 --> 38:21.876
So...

38:21.900 --> 38:26.906
He told me that I had to take
care of the reporter.

38:30.074 --> 38:32.145
Ufland was thousands of miles away.

38:32.177 --> 38:34.350
Why didn't you say no?

38:36.247 --> 38:39.251
He has a lot of friends in the drug gangs.

38:39.284 --> 38:40.888
A lot of friends.

38:40.919 --> 38:44.093
He said if I refused, one
of them would do it anyway,

38:44.122 --> 38:46.534
and then he would come after me, too.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.662
No one in the governor's office

38:50.695 --> 38:53.437
was aware of Mr. Wiegert's
activities soliciting money.

38:53.464 --> 38:55.535
The pardon was my call.

38:55.567 --> 38:58.878
I felt Mrs. Ufland's petition
had merit on humanitarian grounds,

38:58.903 --> 39:00.507
and recommended it to the governor.

39:00.538 --> 39:02.449
There was no quid pro quo.

39:02.473 --> 39:04.976
Ufland was our case.

39:05.009 --> 39:08.456
If you had nothing to hide,
why weren't we consulted?

39:08.479 --> 39:11.949
The governor's power to grant
pardons is absolute.

39:11.983 --> 39:15.328
There's no statutory obligation
for him to consult anyone.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.800
But he felt obligated to consult
his brother-in-law.

39:20.458 --> 39:22.438
Larry Wiegert is a con man.

39:22.460 --> 39:25.532
He conned Stephanie Ufland into
believing he could arrange a pardon

39:25.563 --> 39:28.544
in order to extort a quarter
of a million dollar commission from her.

39:28.566 --> 39:30.568
The governor knew nothing about it.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.013
He has no access to the governor.

39:32.036 --> 39:36.041
He has access to you, Mr. Fitzgerald,

39:36.074 --> 39:38.554
and we have the phone records to prove it.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.981
Out of respect for the governor's wife,

39:43.014 --> 39:46.291
I treat him with civility,
which is more than he deserves.

39:47.852 --> 39:50.662
The buck stops with Larry Wiegert...

39:50.688 --> 39:52.634
Period.

39:52.657 --> 39:55.160
Mr. Carver, Detectives.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.842
There it is in a nutshell.

40:02.867 --> 40:07.316
Larry Wiegert's word
against the governor, his wife,

40:07.338 --> 40:11.252
the chief of staff, the whole damn
political machine.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.383
There they go, down the rabbit hole.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.193
We can still get Richard Ufland for murder.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.356
If we can find him.

40:21.386 --> 40:23.559
His wife can point us in the right direction.

40:24.822 --> 40:26.961
Now why would she do that?

40:26.991 --> 40:28.595
Because you're going to arrest her.

40:28.626 --> 40:30.628
And if she doesn't cooperate,

40:30.662 --> 40:32.471
she doesn't get out of jail.

40:32.497 --> 40:35.239
No, that's not the deal that we made with her.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.041
I didn't authorize you to make any deal.

40:37.068 --> 40:40.914
You damn well did. We
told her what you told us:

40:40.939 --> 40:43.317
that you had no interest
in sending her to jail.

40:43.341 --> 40:47.255
I didn't, but if I have to,
I will. And now I have to.

40:47.278 --> 40:50.054
- Well, I'm not arresting her.
- Count me out, too.

40:50.081 --> 40:52.118
Detectives.

40:52.150 --> 40:55.324
We are supposed to be better than
the people that we're prosecuting.

40:55.353 --> 40:58.527
The governor might've taken a bribe,
but he kept up his end of the bargain.

40:58.556 --> 41:00.797
If you don't arrest her...

41:03.027 --> 41:05.200
I will find somebody who will.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.006
Well then, let us talk to her.

41:10.034 --> 41:12.344
Oh.

41:12.370 --> 41:14.907
We'll talk to her.

41:19.644 --> 41:22.887
I told you everything I know!
You promised me this wouldn't happen!

41:22.914 --> 41:26.384
We know what we promised, and we're
doing what we can to keep that promise.

41:26.417 --> 41:28.158
But right now, outside this room,

41:28.186 --> 41:30.962
there's a fax machine spitting
out a warrant for your arrest.

41:30.989 --> 41:34.129
We can't stop the DA
from putting you in jail.

41:34.158 --> 41:36.570
This is the most outrageous thing
I have ever heard.

41:36.594 --> 41:39.165
She made your case for you.

41:39.197 --> 41:43.475
- She had a deal.
- She'll have a deal...
when we have your husband.

41:44.469 --> 41:48.315
I am not going to help you
put the father of my children in jail.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.548
May I remind you that there are
two people dead because of that man?

41:51.576 --> 41:54.489
- I can't care about that!
- Well, you need to care!

41:54.512 --> 41:58.289
You're not just protecting a husband anymore,
you're protecting a double murderer.

41:58.316 --> 42:00.922
If you're going to do that,
you belong in jail.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.926
This isn't fair.

42:07.091 --> 42:09.367
You need to decide, Mrs. Ufland,

42:09.394 --> 42:11.499
what kind of person you are,

42:13.197 --> 42:14.904
what you're teaching your kids

42:14.932 --> 42:17.776
by letting this husband of yours go free.

42:28.846 --> 42:30.154
(sighs heavily)

42:33.851 --> 42:37.321
He's going to be in Mexico City
the day after tomorrow.

42:38.856 --> 42:42.998
I arranged for my parents to bring
my eldest son to meet him there.

42:44.862 --> 42:47.069
Bastards.

42:47.098 --> 42:49.305
You're all bastards.

43:03.214 --> 43:06.058
Welcome home, Mr. Ufland.

43:12.023 --> 43:14.003
They should teach this case

43:14.025 --> 43:16.938
at the governor's School of Government.

43:16.961 --> 43:18.736
Law school ethics class--

43:18.763 --> 43:21.004
that's where they should teach it, Counselor.

43:33.978 --> 43:35.958
