00:27.660 --> 00:30.128
- They get soggy is all I'm saying.
- Ben.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.322
You let 'em sit too long,
they taste like mush.

00:32.465 --> 00:33.955
Then eat 'em when you pour 'em.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.034
What if something comes up?

00:36.169 --> 00:38.069
What if you have to use the bathroom?

00:38.204 --> 00:39.364
Where's Yolanda?

00:39.506 --> 00:42.873
- Relax. She's picking up the chips.
- They're out of guacamole.

00:43.009 --> 00:43.998
I don't like guacamole anyway.

00:44.144 --> 00:45.372
- I got chips.
- No.

00:45.512 --> 00:47.878
How are we gonna have chips
with no guacamole?

01:00.827 --> 01:01.953
I have a hypothetical for you.

01:02.095 --> 01:06.122
How long till after you pour your cereal
do you wait to put it in your mouth?

01:06.266 --> 01:09.258
- I don't eat cereal.
- She doesn't eat cereal.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.529
With an ass like that,
she eats something.

01:11.671 --> 01:13.866
- That's enough.
- 25 even.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.736
What do you think, Ben?

01:15.875 --> 01:17.900
No. I'm going home to sleep.

01:18.044 --> 01:20.604
Why? She'd be so nice for us.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.113
Come on. Let's do it, Ben.

01:23.249 --> 01:24.238
Stop.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.284
What else you gonna do, huh?

01:26.419 --> 01:28.284
No, I, um...

01:28.421 --> 01:29.854
Come on, guys.

01:29.989 --> 01:31.286
Let's do this,
then you can sleep.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.056
- Let's go, Ben.
- Okay.

02:24.277 --> 02:27.110
Penelope, you gotta stop staring at her.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.306
Prentiss wouldn't want us to sulk.
You know that.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.344
I'm not sulking.

02:34.687 --> 02:36.882
I'm surrounded by testosterone now.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.454
She would also want us
to embrace Seaver.

02:43.930 --> 02:45.158
I baked.

02:45.298 --> 02:49.166
Congratulations, "Gradua?"

02:49.302 --> 02:51.497
Kevin ate the T.

02:51.638 --> 02:54.038
And the E.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.007
Come on, you.

02:57.143 --> 02:59.043
Listen, I got an idea.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.510
You and I could eat
the U and the A,

03:00.647 --> 03:02.376
and that way it would say
"Congratulations, grad."

03:02.515 --> 03:04.642
- Hmm.
- Hmm?

03:04.784 --> 03:06.649
And here I always imagined
you feeding me strawberries.

03:09.222 --> 03:11.850
Yes. Yes, you do.

03:11.991 --> 03:13.822
Thank you.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.359
How you doing?

03:15.495 --> 03:16.655
All right.

03:16.796 --> 03:18.093
I'm worried about the team,

03:18.231 --> 03:20.461
and Strauss thinks that adding
a probationary agent

03:20.600 --> 03:22.090
is gonna solve our problems.

03:22.235 --> 03:24.260
Seaver knows she's
not replacing Prentiss.

03:24.404 --> 03:26.668
I know. And she's got potential,

03:26.806 --> 03:29.366
But we need an experienced profiler
and we need one now.

03:29.509 --> 03:31.204
Have you started looking yet?

03:31.344 --> 03:33.369
Yeah. Let me know
if you have any ideas.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.037
Congratulations, Agent Seaver.

03:35.181 --> 03:36.375
Thank you.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.541
- Who made the cupcakes?
- I did.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.778
Thank you all for coming to my graduation.
It meant a lot.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.148
Let's get started.

03:42.288 --> 03:43.949
Okay, we're going to Portland, Oregon,

03:44.090 --> 03:45.580
and it's not for a Dead Moon concert.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.717
So, Jay Johnson, a DJ,
was cutting through an alley

03:48.861 --> 03:50.522
on his way home after leaving a club

03:50.663 --> 03:52.130
when he was bludgeoned by a pipe

03:52.265 --> 03:54.165
and then stabbed 31 times.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.029
His watch, his cell,
and his computer were stolen.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.193
That was two days ago.

03:57.337 --> 03:58.702
Now, early this morning,

03:58.838 --> 04:01.602
Karen Heywood,
a 30-year-old nurse,

04:01.741 --> 04:03.231
she died during a home invasion.

04:03.376 --> 04:04.934
She was stabbed 40 times,

04:05.078 --> 04:07.569
but first she was bludgeoned

04:07.714 --> 04:09.238
with weapons of opportunity.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.077
Eight different ones, to be exact.

04:11.217 --> 04:12.878
That's too many weapons
for one person.

04:13.019 --> 04:15.510
There was a left- and a right-handed killer,
according to the M.E. Report.

04:15.655 --> 04:17.714
Yeah, but eight different weapons.

04:17.857 --> 04:18.880
So we're looking for a group.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.014
Yeah, it seems that way.

04:20.159 --> 04:21.786
And the left-handed wounds
were deeper than the right.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.294
- Maybe a woman was involved?
- Or a weak man.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.727
Anything taken from the house?

04:25.865 --> 04:27.264
According to a neighbor,
just some random stuff...

04:27.400 --> 04:30.096
a computer, some jewelry,
a framed picture of a lily.

04:30.236 --> 04:31.362
And pawnable items.

04:31.504 --> 04:32.596
What do we have,
serial-killing crooks?

04:32.739 --> 04:35.037
- Sounds like a musical.
- Similar victimology...

04:35.174 --> 04:36.641
young professionals
killed three miles apart.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.641
Is there a gang situation
in Portland?

04:38.778 --> 04:41.804
Minimal. This seems more like
desperate people in need of quick cash.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.643
Why kill them
if it's just for the money?

04:43.783 --> 04:45.375
That's what we have to find out.

04:45.518 --> 04:47.611
And we've got eight hours
till nightfall. Let's go.

04:49.722 --> 04:51.417
##

05:17.150 --> 05:18.947
What the hell you doing?
I'm trying to sleep.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.785
It's 2 in the afternoon, buddy.

05:22.922 --> 05:25.288
- You want some, baby?
- No, I want... I want to sleep.

05:26.693 --> 05:28.217
Not until you get cleaned up.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.978
<i>Lizette Reese wrote,</i>

06:24.117 --> 06:27.280
<i>"The old faiths light</i>
<i>their candles all about,</i>

06:27.420 --> 06:30.685
<i>but burly truth comes by</i>
and puts them out."

06:33.493 --> 06:36.553
So both victims around
the same age and killed at night.

06:36.696 --> 06:38.960
One in an alley on the way to his car,
the other in her home

06:39.098 --> 06:41.658
after coming from
the grocery after work.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.564
There's extreme overkill in both.

06:43.703 --> 06:46.968
Overkill usually implies
a personal relationship.

06:47.106 --> 06:48.334
Or it could mean that
the victim represents

06:48.474 --> 06:50.408
someone for whom the killer
has extreme anger.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.408
These unsubs are night owls,

06:52.545 --> 06:54.376
stalking and killing other night owls.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.674
And they're also disorganized.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.373
In one, they subdued their victims

06:57.517 --> 06:58.779
by hitting them with
a pipe found at the scene,

06:58.918 --> 07:00.146
and the other, they used a knife,

07:00.286 --> 07:02.618
followed by seven other items
found in the kitchen.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.916
A doorstop, even a ceramic cat.

07:05.057 --> 07:06.786
All of this just to steal?

07:06.926 --> 07:08.393
When a gang mentality sets in,

07:08.528 --> 07:11.520
unsubs become more capable
of heinous acts.

07:11.664 --> 07:14.758
It's still odd. The incidence
of robbery is so low in this area.

07:14.901 --> 07:16.994
That's why I started working
a geographical profile.

07:17.136 --> 07:19.127
First things first, I factored in
journey to crime distance.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.967
If you look here,

07:21.107 --> 07:22.597
you'll see that this area of Portland

07:22.742 --> 07:24.710
is well within the expected 5-mile radius.

07:24.844 --> 07:26.869
I also factored in distance of decay.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.503
What does distance
have to do with decay?

07:28.648 --> 07:31.776
It's how geo-profilers
measure relative probability

07:31.918 --> 07:34.978
of an offender traveling
outside his comfort zone.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.986
Unsubs prefer to stay in
an area that they know well.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.091
Like you'd commute
to work or to the gym.

07:39.225 --> 07:41.193
The closer the crime scenes,
the greater likelihood it is

07:41.327 --> 07:42.988
that the unsub lives
or works nearby.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.653
Based on my algorithm,

07:44.797 --> 07:47.766
the unsubs either live
or work in the area.

07:53.473 --> 07:56.465
Your sink needs a new washer.

07:56.609 --> 07:59.476
You got a washer in here?

07:59.612 --> 08:02.445
No. I don't work for you.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.379
You sure about that, Ben?

08:04.517 --> 08:07.042
Maybe we should do a Home Store run.

08:07.186 --> 08:08.744
Just put a bowl underneath it.

08:08.888 --> 08:12.915
Aw, come on, laziness
is next to slothfulness, Ben.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.493
There's a 24-hour Home Store
near the freeway.

08:17.463 --> 08:18.862
Come on, guys.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.932
Get your keys.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.159
No.

08:22.301 --> 08:23.666
Uh...

08:23.803 --> 08:26.169
Are you back-talking me?

08:26.305 --> 08:28.739
I just... I don't feel like going.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.433
I don't care how you feel.

08:30.576 --> 08:33.010
Now get your keys and let's go.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.075
The neighborhood's very concerned.

08:38.217 --> 08:41.414
Detective, did your people
process the crime scene?

08:41.554 --> 08:42.919
We wanted you to take a look at it.

08:43.054 --> 08:44.647
Maybe you'll see
something we missed.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.224
The M.E.'s report says

08:47.360 --> 08:48.486
she died after the second stab wound

08:48.628 --> 08:50.095
because they hit an artery.

08:50.229 --> 08:52.254
The other wounds didn't bleed.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.593
So why inflict 38 more?

08:54.734 --> 08:56.793
We see it sometimes with groups.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.166
The fact that others are involved

08:59.305 --> 09:01.239
Helps each of them rationalize
their own violent behavior.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.501
Like Manson or the genocide in Darfur.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.372
These unsubs like
the feeling of killing.

09:05.511 --> 09:07.274
They get a high from
the adrenaline release.

09:07.413 --> 09:11.372
Yeah, but that lasts only as long
as the victim keeps struggling.

09:11.517 --> 09:13.417
That's not what happened here.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.627
So Mr. Johnson exits the nightclub

09:21.761 --> 09:24.423
through the back door to get to his car.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.623
Maybe one unsub
can watch from over there

09:26.766 --> 09:29.064
and the other from back there.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.169
Then when he gets here,
another unsub hits him with a pipe

09:31.304 --> 09:32.464
and it's game on.

09:32.605 --> 09:35.096
Look at the vials, Reid.
This is a drug corridor.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.503
That would explain why
there's so much overkill.

09:36.642 --> 09:37.973
Maybe they were on something.

09:38.110 --> 09:40.442
On the jet I did some
research into the club.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.445
A year ago,
someone O.D.'d inside.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.846
Since then, new management's
clamped down on the partying.

09:44.984 --> 09:46.679
Which means the unsubs
most likely fit in to this area.

09:46.819 --> 09:50.220
Well, if you can't party inside,
then you come out out here.

09:50.356 --> 09:54.019
- They're probably all the same age.
- Mid-20s.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.493
I checked the back.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.155
There's a flat-screen,
a desktop, and a bicycle.

10:00.299 --> 10:02.164
Now, if this group's
going for pawnable items,

10:02.301 --> 10:04.895
why take a picture of a lily
and other random things?

10:05.037 --> 10:07.335
- Maybe they ran out of time.
- It's not a busy neighborhood.

10:07.473 --> 10:09.304
Is the TV bolted down?

10:09.442 --> 10:12.104
No. So a group of unsubs
would have grabbed it.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.577
What if we're looking
for a single unsub?

10:15.715 --> 10:18.775
You think all these footprints
were made by one person?

10:18.918 --> 10:20.977
A group so disorganized
wouldn't do something

10:21.120 --> 10:23.054
as hyper-organized
as wearing the same shoe.

10:23.189 --> 10:27.057
No, I don't think it's a group.
I think it's one very erratic killer.

10:28.761 --> 10:31.628
I'll let Morgan know.

10:31.764 --> 10:34.198
You're sure you didn't see
a group here that night?

10:34.333 --> 10:35.891
No. Just that woman
and a few other people,

10:36.035 --> 10:37.161
But no groups.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.328
Look, if our cameras worked,
you could see for yourself.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.337
Is it possible there was a group
out in the parking lot?

10:41.474 --> 10:43.135
It's a ghost town.
Nothing happens here that late.

10:43.275 --> 10:44.799
All right, tell me where
you saw Karen first.

10:44.944 --> 10:45.968
She was buying cookies,

10:46.112 --> 10:48.603
and then she went to the register.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.182
Any other customers there?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.978
There was one at the other checkout.

10:53.119 --> 10:56.714
Why would you have two registers
open that time of night?

10:56.856 --> 10:59.256
There was this weird guy,
mumbling to himself

10:59.392 --> 11:01.758
and swatting the air
like someone was bugging him.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.522
Can you ring me up over here?

11:06.065 --> 11:07.259
No problem.

11:07.867 --> 11:10.199
- What did this guy look like?
- Regular white dude.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.531
Greasy.
He was buying salt,

11:12.672 --> 11:14.105
bag of chips, water.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.231
Did this guy and Karen interact?

11:16.375 --> 11:18.104
I have a hypothetical for you.

11:18.244 --> 11:21.873
He said something to her,
but she blew him off.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.481
Just put her head down and said
something dismissive back?

11:23.616 --> 11:25.049
Yeah, that's it. Yeah.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.345
We tend to do that when
strange people talk to us.

11:27.486 --> 11:29.454
Unfortunately, it can backfire.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.120
Yeah, Hotch. You were right.
He was by himself,

11:37.263 --> 11:39.197
but he was acting strange,
like he was being followed.

11:39.331 --> 11:40.923
<i>Reid and Seaver went to the club</i>

11:41.067 --> 11:43.900
and found that the first victim
was killed in an area of high drug use.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.061
If he's hallucinating,
it could be PCP.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.263
That would explain why

11:47.406 --> 11:49.806
<i>he stole random things</i>
<i>from Karen's place.</i>

11:49.942 --> 11:52.274
- He was out of it.
- And the erratic patterns in the stabbings.

11:52.411 --> 11:53.776
The adrenaline rush from the drugs

11:53.913 --> 11:55.073
<i>is probably behind the overkill.</i>

11:55.214 --> 11:57.512
Go ahead, Garcia.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.345
Okay, I checked all
the local pawn shops

11:59.485 --> 12:01.112
to see if any of those stolen
items had shown up there.

12:01.253 --> 12:02.914
I'm coming up empty.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.080
Maybe he's trading
the goods for drugs.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.987
<i>What do you mean, he?</i>
<i>We're talking about a group, right?</i>

12:07.126 --> 12:10.289
No, we think it's a solo addict
who's hallucinating that he's not alone.

12:10.429 --> 12:12.226
Wow. That is a game-changer.

12:12.364 --> 12:13.353
Thanks.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.499
What in hell are you waiting for? Ben!

12:18.637 --> 12:20.628
Shut up.

12:20.773 --> 12:23.333
Take the friggin' hammer
and bang him in the head.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.465
No.

12:24.610 --> 12:26.703
Not this time.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.805
- It's what we came here to do.
- Be a man, Ben.

12:29.949 --> 12:32.247
- I am a man.
- Take the hammer.

12:32.384 --> 12:35.547
That's why we went
to the Home Store, Ben.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.246
What if I don't?

12:37.389 --> 12:39.118
Come on! Hurry up!

12:39.258 --> 12:40.850
Fine! Stop yelling at me!

12:40.993 --> 12:42.392
Do it.

12:45.231 --> 12:46.630
That a boy.

13:02.515 --> 13:05.416
So, the time of death

13:05.551 --> 13:08.645
was about the same
as the last two kills.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.585
He's continuing the
postmortem stabbing.

13:10.723 --> 13:11.849
I counted 40 wounds.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.824
He's accelerating.
Two kills, one day apart.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.485
If he's on PCP,
he'd be so violent,

13:17.630 --> 13:18.824
he'd use every muscle he had.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.660
He'd strangle, kick, bludgeon.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.893
The bedroom's a mess.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.969
We need to find someone
who knew the place

13:25.104 --> 13:27.299
in order to figure out
specifically what was taken.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.703
Hey, guys.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.241
You hear that?

13:31.377 --> 13:32.639
Footsteps upstairs?

13:32.778 --> 13:34.507
You think they heard something?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.512
I think the person downstairs did.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.880
Gosh, I've been
in this building 27 years.

13:40.019 --> 13:42.886
Now, the worst incident we ever had

13:43.022 --> 13:44.853
was when Benjamin Headley up in 402

13:44.990 --> 13:47.288
found out his wife was sleeping
with the cleaner guy

13:47.426 --> 13:49.690
and shot him in the groin.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.989
Ma'am, when did you hear
the screaming?

13:51.130 --> 13:52.154
Oh, it was late.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.391
It was around, uh, 3:30.

13:54.533 --> 13:55.966
Well, then you must have
heard the unsub,

13:56.101 --> 13:58.535
because according to the M.E.,
Joe died around 2:45.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.138
The wh-what? What?

14:00.272 --> 14:01.261
Our suspect, ma'am.

14:01.407 --> 14:02.396
Oh.

14:02.541 --> 14:04.702
What exactly was the person yelling?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.642
He said, "I was just a kid.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.975
"I was a kid then.

14:10.115 --> 14:11.412
I don't want to kill anymore."

14:11.984 --> 14:14.817
Was anybody talking back to him?

14:14.954 --> 14:17.286
I assumed he was yelling
into the phone or something.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.983
You know, maybe he was having
a conversation with his hallucination.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.683
Ohh.

14:21.827 --> 14:23.260
Was he hearing voices?

14:23.395 --> 14:24.885
We're not really sure, ma'am.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.657
You've been a really
big help, Mrs. Donolly.

14:26.799 --> 14:27.857
Thank you very much.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.525
If you have any more
questions for me,

14:30.669 --> 14:32.261
you know where to find me.

14:32.404 --> 14:33.735
Bye.

14:37.476 --> 14:40.138
PCP hallucinations are terrifying.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.179
He wouldn't want to talk to them.

14:42.314 --> 14:45.044
Well, hallucinations from mental
illnesses are not as violent.

14:45.184 --> 14:47.652
You know, he's in his 20s
and was acting paranoid in the supermarket.

14:47.786 --> 14:49.913
He sounds like a paranoid
schizophrenic to me.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.920
The disease does manifest
itself at this age.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.720
What if the people he's seeing
are blaming him for something.

14:55.861 --> 14:58.659
Or worse. The voices in his head
could be telling him to kill.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.646
Baby, it's not gonna work.

15:16.782 --> 15:18.181
L-L-leave me alone!

15:18.317 --> 15:20.478
No, no, that is not gonna cut it.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.177
Get out!

15:22.321 --> 15:23.583
Oh, we're never
gonna leave. Ha ha!

15:23.722 --> 15:25.349
You should have never hurt us.

15:25.491 --> 15:26.753
I don't know nothin' about that.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.592
Oh, pick up.

15:32.731 --> 15:35.461
Ben, she's not gonna help, buddy.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.592
She can help.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.829
- Hey!
- Let me be!

15:48.247 --> 15:50.477
Ben, is... is that you?

15:50.616 --> 15:52.675
Yeah, it's m-me, Mama.

15:52.818 --> 15:54.183
Are you upset?

15:54.320 --> 15:56.550
You... You sound upset, Ben.

15:56.689 --> 16:00.785
<i>I... I need your help.</i>

16:00.926 --> 16:04.020
What can Mommy do to help?

16:04.163 --> 16:05.926
<i>And are you stuttering again?</i>

16:06.065 --> 16:07.862
Mama, they're back.

16:10.235 --> 16:12.294
Have you taken the medication?

16:12.438 --> 16:14.303
No, it doesn't work.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.637
I'm getting sick of these calls, Ben.

16:17.776 --> 16:19.573
You can't hold down a job.
You can barely function.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.236
Are you praying, Ben?

16:22.681 --> 16:25.047
Maybe I should just kill myself.

16:25.184 --> 16:29.280
Ben, you need to go
to church like I told you.

16:29.421 --> 16:33.118
The church helped you
the last time with this problem.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.418
She's lying, Ben.
That's what mothers do.

16:36.562 --> 16:37.893
You stop it.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.791
Mama, I need help now.

16:43.936 --> 16:47.497
Then find a yellow pages
and find a church nearby.

16:47.639 --> 16:49.834
I am sick of these calls,
and I am sick of listening to you!

16:49.975 --> 16:51.567
No, Mama, please don't hang up.

17:28.580 --> 17:30.639
We believe our unsub is
a white male paranoid schizophrenic

17:30.783 --> 17:32.683
who suffers from hallucinations.

17:32.818 --> 17:34.945
Since schizophrenic breaks
usually occur in your early 20s,

17:35.087 --> 17:37.021
we believe he's around this age
and that he lives nearby.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.647
We think this unsub
is hypervigilant,

17:39.792 --> 17:43.125
and in this condition, he's unable
to travel very far from his home.

17:43.262 --> 17:45.457
He kills at night
and is extremely violent.

17:45.597 --> 17:48.225
During the day,
he's most likely a loner.

17:48.367 --> 17:51.131
Someone in this state
probably can't keep a job.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.602
We believe something happened
to our unsub in his childhood.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.435
Childhood voices
are telling him to kill,

17:56.575 --> 17:58.975
or he's misinterpreting
them as doing so.

17:59.111 --> 18:01.807
Our unsub has probably
been coping until now,

18:01.947 --> 18:03.847
but a recent stressor brought him
back to that childhood incident

18:03.982 --> 18:05.643
and is causing him to act out.

18:06.685 --> 18:08.448
Our unsub spends
his days wandering,

18:08.587 --> 18:11.078
trying to fight the desire to kill,

18:11.223 --> 18:13.316
yet he feels trapped
by his hallucinations.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.268
No matter what he does or tries to do,

18:27.406 --> 18:29.738
the hallucination's power
is greater than his own.

18:32.010 --> 18:35.104
Because of his limited
social circle as a child,

18:35.247 --> 18:37.738
it is our belief that the incident
involved close friends or family.

18:37.883 --> 18:40.010
Now, once we figure out what
happened when he was a kid

18:40.152 --> 18:42.245
and the stressor that recently
triggered a relapse,

18:42.387 --> 18:44.548
we'll be that much closer
to narrowing down the killer's identity.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.921
Mama said,
"Ben, they're not there."

18:49.461 --> 18:52.089
Oh, I didn't see...

18:52.231 --> 18:54.256
Reid?

18:54.399 --> 18:57.027
We need you all to start
searching in this area.

18:57.169 --> 19:00.036
Based on previous kills,
we know that he strikes at night

19:00.172 --> 19:01.935
and will not retreat until we find him.

19:54.593 --> 19:55.787
Hello.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.352
May I help you?

20:01.300 --> 20:04.827
I n-need... need someone to talk to.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.598
Let me finish lighting these candles.

20:18.016 --> 20:20.849
What seems to be the problem, sir?

20:20.986 --> 20:23.716
I've been seeing things.

20:23.855 --> 20:27.222
They're b-b-blaming me for the fire.

20:27.359 --> 20:30.487
Who, son? What fire?

20:31.697 --> 20:34.165
An eye for an eye?

20:34.299 --> 20:36.392
I n-need you to get rid of them.

20:36.535 --> 20:39.231
What would you like me to do, son?

20:42.441 --> 20:45.035
When I was 10...

20:45.177 --> 20:46.974
the church, they helped me.

20:47.112 --> 20:49.307
What did they do for you?

20:50.882 --> 20:52.440
They prayed for me.

20:56.121 --> 20:57.520
Gather 'round, all.

20:57.656 --> 20:59.749
God, help this child.

20:59.891 --> 21:02.883
Release his demons.

21:03.028 --> 21:06.054
They called my name.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.665
Ben!

21:07.799 --> 21:09.357
Ben!

21:09.501 --> 21:11.059
Ben!

21:11.203 --> 21:12.465
Ben!

21:12.604 --> 21:15.573
They told me I'd be freed.

21:15.707 --> 21:18.039
Ben! Ben!

21:18.176 --> 21:20.576
Ben! Ben!

21:20.712 --> 21:24.170
Ben! Ben!

21:24.316 --> 21:26.876
Ben! Ben!

21:27.019 --> 21:30.511
Ben! Ben!

21:30.656 --> 21:33.716
They p-poured water on my head.

21:33.859 --> 21:36.760
They performed an exorcism on you.

21:36.895 --> 21:38.920
I need you to do it again.

21:39.064 --> 21:41.225
What you have is a medical
problem, not a spiritual one.

21:41.366 --> 21:43.266
I've been to a doctor.

21:43.402 --> 21:45.996
Churches don't perform
exorcisms anymore.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.469
I need you to make an exception.

21:47.606 --> 21:49.335
- I'm sorry, but I don't do...
- I need help!

21:49.474 --> 21:50.532
Son. Son!

21:50.676 --> 21:53.042
- I need help!
- Son, calm down.

21:55.981 --> 21:58.575
You know, that profile kind
of makes it sound like

21:58.717 --> 22:01.379
schizophrenia leads to serial killing.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.249
That's not what we said at all, Reid.

22:03.388 --> 22:04.685
You know, my mom
has schizophrenia.

22:04.823 --> 22:05.812
There are many different types.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.049
I know that.

22:07.192 --> 22:10.059
Catatonic, disorganized...

22:10.195 --> 22:12.789
Just because someone suffers
from inability to organize their thoughts,

22:12.931 --> 22:15.263
or they can't bathe
or dress themselves,

22:15.400 --> 22:17.698
It doesn't mean they'd stab someone
in the chest 30 times postmortem.

22:17.836 --> 22:20.805
Reid, what's really going on?

22:20.939 --> 22:23.169
Our unsub's hallucinations
aren't fractured

22:23.308 --> 22:25.139
like a typical schizophrenic.

22:25.277 --> 22:26.676
They're vivid and clear,

22:26.812 --> 22:29.508
leading me to believe that we're
missing an important variable.

22:29.648 --> 22:31.275
Rather than making
crazy conjectures,

22:31.416 --> 22:33.941
I think we should be trying
to figure out what it is.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.519
Okay, listen to me.

22:35.654 --> 22:38.020
I know this is a scary age for you.

22:38.156 --> 22:40.647
It's when schizophrenic breaks happen.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.191
Have you talked
to anybody about this?

22:42.327 --> 22:43.385
Emily.

22:44.763 --> 22:46.697
Have you seen a doctor?

22:46.832 --> 22:48.094
They all say I'm fine.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.167
Then why don't you believe them?

22:50.302 --> 22:51.997
Because predicting one's chances
of developing a genetic condition

22:52.137 --> 22:54.970
are like finding a penny in an ocean.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.802
I have terrible headaches.
I can't sleep at night.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.933
I can't focus on our cases.

22:59.077 --> 23:01.477
I only read 5 books last week.

23:01.613 --> 23:03.638
Come on, kid, you gotta
cut yourself some slack.

23:03.782 --> 23:04.874
You're also depressed about Prentiss,

23:05.016 --> 23:06.677
And I get it... We all are.

23:06.818 --> 23:08.683
Reid, I miss her every day.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.310
But if your mind was splitting,

23:10.455 --> 23:11.820
do you really think
you'd be able to figure out

23:11.957 --> 23:13.185
that this team is missing a variable?

23:15.093 --> 23:17.254
I'm just speculating that we are.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.660
Need to prove it.

23:19.798 --> 23:21.265
Okay, then you do that.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.233
The moment you are wandering
around the streets aimlessly,

23:24.369 --> 23:27.236
that's when I'll be
concerned about you.

23:27.372 --> 23:29.397
Come on, pretty boy.
Let's get to work.

23:32.677 --> 23:34.076
Had you not used
that lighter, Ben,

23:34.212 --> 23:36.612
none of this
would have happened.

23:41.119 --> 23:43.644
Ben, I said wait up!

23:43.789 --> 23:46.587
Sir, don't let 'em on, please.

23:46.725 --> 23:49.091
Don't let 'em on.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.252
You can't run, Ben.

23:51.396 --> 23:53.023
No, they're lying.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.894
Go sit down, kid.

24:04.376 --> 24:06.207
Because of HPPA laws, I can't get
information on 20-something-year-olds

24:06.344 --> 24:07.572
who've had schizophrenic breaks.

24:07.712 --> 24:09.771
Then check police records.
Maybe he's been arrested.

24:09.915 --> 24:12.748
Oh, I should have thought of that.
Blame the fumes. Okay.

24:17.222 --> 24:20.919
Hey, six kids have been locked up
in the last month within a 40-mile radius.

24:21.059 --> 24:22.151
Any of them for theft?

24:22.294 --> 24:23.556
<i>Um... mugging,</i>

24:23.695 --> 24:25.526
lewd behavior, car theft.

24:25.664 --> 24:27.222
<i>All right, go through</i>
<i>personal information.</i>

24:27.365 --> 24:29.060
Maybe they've had run-ins
with the law when they were younger.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.463
Yes, sir, I am on that.

24:30.602 --> 24:32.900
You know, at the grocery store
where Karen Heywood was shopping

24:33.038 --> 24:35.097
the night she was murdered,
the clerk said the unsub

24:35.240 --> 24:36.969
was buying water and a lot of salt.

24:37.108 --> 24:39.633
Saltwater could be used
to torture his victims.

24:39.778 --> 24:41.643
Well, there's no evidence of that.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.475
It could also be used to remove
victims' blood from clothing.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.742
Think about this, though.
The visions that schizophrenics have

24:45.884 --> 24:47.613
can be interpreted as demons.

24:47.752 --> 24:49.913
What do some people do when they think
they have demons inside of them?

24:50.055 --> 24:51.386
They could get an exorcism.

24:51.523 --> 24:53.252
Holy water is used in exorcisms.

24:53.391 --> 24:54.619
What about the salt?

24:54.759 --> 24:56.727
Salt is used in exorcisms
and a variety of religious healings.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.261
What are you looking for?

24:58.396 --> 25:00.762
The number of churches
in the comfort zone... Three.

25:00.899 --> 25:03.094
All right, let's see if any of
them keep their doors open late.

25:06.938 --> 25:10.897
I'm not hurting an old lady.

25:14.079 --> 25:16.206
Come on, if you do it,
it'll help things.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.009
It's always temporary with you.

25:18.149 --> 25:21.050
I need it to work forever.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.586
Pretend it's your mom,

25:23.722 --> 25:25.713
The mother who's sick
of listening to you.

25:31.630 --> 25:34.599
You promise
you'll go away this time?

25:35.667 --> 25:37.294
Have we ever lied to you, Ben?

25:52.918 --> 25:57.321
He came here in duress
about two hours ago.

25:57.455 --> 25:59.116
What did he say?

25:59.257 --> 26:00.246
He said...

26:00.392 --> 26:04.852
He said voices were blaming him for a fire,

26:04.996 --> 26:07.328
and he needed me to get rid of them.

26:07.465 --> 26:09.160
You're right.
He thinks he's haunted.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.326
Did he ask you for an exorcism?

26:11.469 --> 26:13.835
Yes. He claimed his mother
had taken him to get one

26:13.972 --> 26:15.530
when he was young.

26:15.674 --> 26:18.302
- And what did you tell him?
- I couldn't do it.

26:18.443 --> 26:20.070
Throughout history,
people have confused

26:20.211 --> 26:22.042
possession with mental illness.

26:22.180 --> 26:23.545
Some still do.

26:23.682 --> 26:28.016
Nowadays, most churches turn people
like him over to medical professionals.

26:28.153 --> 26:30.121
I'm assuming he didn't
take your rejection well.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.950
He was very angry.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.718
But he didn't attack you?
He didn't threaten you in any way?

26:34.859 --> 26:38.056
He's probably found help
from in the church before.

26:38.196 --> 26:40.164
Was there anything else about
his behavior that you found odd?

26:40.298 --> 26:42.198
Like something
he maybe said or did?

26:42.334 --> 26:44.063
No. I told you everything.

26:44.202 --> 26:47.228
Oh, there is one thing.
He had a stutter.

26:51.476 --> 26:53.740
Okay, well, let me know
what you find, Garcia.

26:53.878 --> 26:55.436
Psychogenetic stuttering
begins in the area of the brain

26:55.580 --> 26:57.673
that controls thoughts and reasoning.

26:57.816 --> 26:59.579
It's most commonly associated
with mental illness.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.379
I checked with the supermarket guy

27:01.519 --> 27:04.044
and the lady at the building,
but neither one of them heard stuttering.

27:04.189 --> 27:06.020
Which means it's either caused
by the schizophrenia medication,

27:06.157 --> 27:07.249
or maybe it's situational.

27:07.392 --> 27:09.121
Well, the presence of it
along with the fire information

27:09.260 --> 27:11.524
should help Garcia
narrow down her list.

27:12.731 --> 27:14.824
##

28:22.600 --> 28:24.363
This victim's a lot older
than his other ones, Morgan.

28:24.502 --> 28:27.403
She must represent
something to him.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.598
Maybe his mother
who had him exorcised.

28:29.741 --> 28:32.005
Now that he can't get one,
he's taking his anger out on a surrogate.

28:32.143 --> 28:33.974
Did the EMTs try to save her?

28:34.112 --> 28:35.272
No. Why?

28:35.413 --> 28:37.176
There's a body imprint next to her.

28:37.315 --> 28:39.749
Why would the unsub lie down
next to a person he's just killed?

28:43.788 --> 28:45.278
He slept here.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.586
Look at the number
of stab wounds.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.025
There's gotta be over 50 of them.

28:51.162 --> 28:52.857
Seventy-one.

28:52.997 --> 28:55.158
Do you know how physically
exhausting it would be

28:55.300 --> 28:58.235
to stab someone 71 times?

29:11.916 --> 29:14.350
It's hard enough to stab
someone 10 times, but 71?

29:14.486 --> 29:16.044
He'd be completely worn out.

29:16.187 --> 29:18.155
He's accelerated wound counts,
which means he does it intentionally.

29:18.289 --> 29:19.779
But why?

29:19.924 --> 29:21.585
Wait, that's it.
If you add the increased

29:21.726 --> 29:23.250
number of stab wounds
and the fact that he slept here

29:23.394 --> 29:25.658
to the vivid hallucinations
and the unexplainable onset of stuttering,

29:25.797 --> 29:27.890
you get the missing variable.
This guy's an insomniac.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.693
Just as adrenaline makes
a person love the feeling of killing,

29:29.834 --> 29:31.267
once it leaves the body
it makes them tired.

29:31.402 --> 29:33.495
He does this all to sleep?

29:33.638 --> 29:35.572
The insomnia is what makes
the hallucinations so clear,

29:35.707 --> 29:38.505
and sleep is the only release
that he has from them.

29:58.830 --> 30:00.058
You said you'd leave.

30:00.198 --> 30:01.859
Stop complaining.
You slept.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.467
That not how I want to do it!

30:03.601 --> 30:05.432
But it worked. You look refreshed
and your stutter's gone.

30:05.570 --> 30:07.834
Move!

30:07.972 --> 30:09.462
You're not gonna try the pills.
They're a waste.

30:09.607 --> 30:12.007
- Then maybe he'll go to the clinic.
- Yeah, maybe I will!

30:12.143 --> 30:14.577
- Get the knife and let's go.
- I want to sleep!

30:14.712 --> 30:17.237
- You sassing me, boy?
- Ben, just get the knife.

30:17.382 --> 30:18.781
I'm not killing anymore!

30:18.917 --> 30:20.350
Why are you making this so difficult?

30:20.485 --> 30:21.975
- Get off!
- Get the knife and let's go.

30:26.357 --> 30:28.825
Okay, here we go.
I looked at that list of schizophrenics

30:28.960 --> 30:31.258
that have been recently
arrested in that 40-mile radius.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.921
I cross-checked it with ones
that have gone to local pharmacies

30:34.065 --> 30:38.092
<i>to get schizophrenia medication</i>
<i>like Thorazine or Prolixin.</i>

30:38.236 --> 30:40.966
Any of them have prescriptions filled for
sleeping medication as well?

30:41.105 --> 30:42.163
Yes, one. Ben Foster.

30:42.307 --> 30:44.832
He has a prescription
for Thorazine and Ambien.

30:51.449 --> 30:53.849
It's likely he uses the money from
the stolen items to buy the pills.

30:53.985 --> 30:55.646
What's his background, baby girl?

31:03.895 --> 31:04.884
Whoa!

31:10.635 --> 31:13.103
He moved to Portland three years ago.

31:13.238 --> 31:14.705
A month ago he was in an apartment fire,

31:14.839 --> 31:16.636
after which he got a sleeping pill medication

31:16.774 --> 31:18.833
<i>because his insomnia began again.</i>

31:24.249 --> 31:25.739
Oh, my. When he was ten,

31:25.884 --> 31:28.114
he was questioned
during an investigation

31:28.253 --> 31:30.778
about a fire that killed three people.

31:30.922 --> 31:32.890
It could be part of
the homicidal triad.

31:33.024 --> 31:35.584
<i>I'm looking at the police report right now.</i>
<i>It turns out two months before,</i>

31:35.727 --> 31:40.426
his mom had a local minister
perform an exorcism on him,

31:40.565 --> 31:42.863
and the three people
who were killed in the fire

31:43.001 --> 31:45.561
- helped perform that exorcism.
- Was Ben charged?

31:45.703 --> 31:47.534
No. He was acquitted in juvie court.

31:56.614 --> 31:59.947
- You got an address?
- Uh, 2627 Halden Way.

32:31.249 --> 32:33.012
What, you thought we had left?

32:33.151 --> 32:34.516
Wishful thinking, huh, Ben?

32:34.652 --> 32:36.620
It's gonna be all right.
It's okay.

32:39.357 --> 32:41.222
What's up?

32:41.359 --> 32:42.792
I think they're after us.

32:42.927 --> 32:44.087
- Come on!
- Come on, Ben.

32:44.228 --> 32:45.786
We don't want to get caught.

32:58.476 --> 33:01.104
- No, no, I didn't do anything.
- If you stay here, they're gonna get you.

33:01.245 --> 33:03.110
- You don't want that, do you?
- I'm not killing anyone!

33:03.247 --> 33:05.477
That's not the point.
You're gonna go to jail if you don't leave.

33:05.616 --> 33:06.844
Ben. Ben!

33:10.588 --> 33:12.681
Let's go.

33:23.701 --> 33:25.498
FBI!

33:34.245 --> 33:35.576
He's out back!

33:52.930 --> 33:54.898
Up you go!

34:02.774 --> 34:05.038
Seaver, let's go!

34:12.949 --> 34:14.246
Go.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.623
Come on, man, we gotta hide.

34:23.828 --> 34:26.661
In here! Whoo!

34:36.040 --> 34:38.270
Hotch, we lost him.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.070
We're gonna check the back alley.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.438
Come on.

34:46.484 --> 34:48.748
Shh.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.646
Hey, Mom, is that you?

35:25.790 --> 35:28.315
Shh! Shh.

35:33.264 --> 35:35.494
I'm not gonna hurt you two.

35:35.633 --> 35:38.193
All right? Listen, I need you
to shut the curtains.

35:38.336 --> 35:39.769
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

35:39.904 --> 35:40.962
Can you do that for me?

35:41.105 --> 35:43.972
Come on. Come on. Okay.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.342
Do it.

35:52.617 --> 35:53.879
Okay.

35:54.886 --> 35:57.013
Okay. Go...

35:57.155 --> 35:58.816
Go help her.
Go help her.

35:58.956 --> 36:00.218
Get that one.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.561
Help him.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.665
Hurry up!

36:31.122 --> 36:33.022
I think we've
got something at 2218.

36:33.157 --> 36:35.318
Come on, g-get this one.

36:41.666 --> 36:43.827
Here, here.

36:43.968 --> 36:47.802
It's okay.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.372
What do you want to do now?

36:49.507 --> 36:51.236
I just want to sleep.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.639
Shh, shh, shh, shh!
No, you can't sleep.

36:53.778 --> 36:56.042
You promised!

36:56.180 --> 36:58.045
We never promised you that.

36:58.182 --> 36:59.547
You can't keep doing this.

36:59.684 --> 37:01.083
We just did, Ben.

37:02.620 --> 37:04.884
Who is he talking to?

37:05.022 --> 37:06.546
Take the little kid out first.

37:06.691 --> 37:09.182
- I'm not hurting the kid.
- Fine, then.

37:09.327 --> 37:10.726
Take the girl.
She's useless.

37:13.531 --> 37:15.897
Make him stop, please.

37:17.201 --> 37:18.429
There's no one there.

37:18.569 --> 37:19.763
They're right there!

37:21.072 --> 37:22.096
Ben, drop the knife.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.466
Don't listen to him, Ben.

37:27.178 --> 37:28.236
Shoot me.

37:31.882 --> 37:33.941
Ben, we're not gonna shoot you,

37:34.085 --> 37:36.883
but we do need you
to put down that knife, okay?

37:37.021 --> 37:39.717
All right, where are the other
people in this room, Ben?

37:39.857 --> 37:42.018
Right there.
You see him?

37:42.159 --> 37:45.322
Right here?

37:45.463 --> 37:47.294
Were they there for the exorcism?

37:47.431 --> 37:49.296
Mm-hmm.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.094
I didn't kill them, though.
I didn't do it.

37:51.235 --> 37:53.328
- Liar.
- And I'm not lying!

37:53.471 --> 37:55.871
Ben, they're dead and they
can't hurt you anymore.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.065
Yeah, they can.

37:57.208 --> 37:59.802
No, Ben. Your mind is
playing tricks on you.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.104
Once you get help,
it'll all stop.

38:01.245 --> 38:02.644
We're never gonna stop, Ben.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.873
- Yes, you are.
- Not until we're done with you.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.450
Yeah, okay.

38:07.585 --> 38:09.450
All right, I killed you.
I set the fire.

38:09.587 --> 38:12.420
Ah, it's about time. Ben!

38:12.556 --> 38:14.148
Ben, listen to us. It's okay.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.385
We're gonna get you a doctor's help.
I promise you that.

38:16.527 --> 38:18.324
No. The...

38:18.462 --> 38:20.327
The only way
that you can help me

38:20.464 --> 38:23.831
is if you do it... if you kill me.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.095
Ben, that's not true.
Listen, the only way

38:26.237 --> 38:28.933
we can help you

38:29.073 --> 38:30.870
is if you take that knife

38:31.008 --> 38:32.771
and you stab me
in the neck with it.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.844
Are you sure that'll work?

38:34.979 --> 38:36.276
Oh, I'm absolutely sure, Ben.

38:36.414 --> 38:37.847
Put that knife down, okay?

38:37.982 --> 38:39.506
Take that knife,

38:39.650 --> 38:41.379
jam me in the neck with it,

38:41.519 --> 38:43.578
and all your problems
will go away, okay?

38:43.721 --> 38:45.848
Okay.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.355
It's okay. Go on.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.825
Okay.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.129
We need an ambulance.

39:06.711 --> 39:08.303
<i>Siddhartha Buddha said,</i>

39:08.446 --> 39:10.038
<i>"It is not his enemy or foe</i>

39:10.181 --> 39:11.876
<i>that lures him to evil ways. "</i>

39:25.996 --> 39:27.793
Why are you still up?

39:29.400 --> 39:30.992
I've been looking over Ben's file.

39:31.135 --> 39:33.228
Turns out he'd been seeing
evil imaginary friends

39:33.371 --> 39:34.736
ever since he was a child.

39:34.872 --> 39:37.067
Ben was always a killer.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.698
You think he had schizophrenia?

39:38.843 --> 39:40.834
He may have suffered
from some mental disease,

39:40.978 --> 39:42.502
but schizophrenia usually presents itself

39:42.646 --> 39:44.580
in your late teens or early 20s.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.148
Ben did kill those people
in that church fire,

39:46.283 --> 39:47.910
which is part of the homicidal triad.

39:48.052 --> 39:50.350
And his mother thought an exorcism
would get rid of the demons.

39:50.488 --> 39:52.786
The only way you stop a killer
is to catch him, Seaver.

39:52.923 --> 39:55.483
You know, I always viewed
serial killers as monsters.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.553
But Ben's remorse seemed real.

40:00.698 --> 40:02.131
And that's why I can't sleep.

40:02.266 --> 40:04.826
I... I can't get him out of my mind.

40:06.370 --> 40:07.997
Does it ever go away?

40:14.145 --> 40:15.476
Luckily, it does.

40:19.884 --> 40:21.647
Try to get some rest.

40:38.602 --> 40:39.967
Ben.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.935
Ben?

40:42.072 --> 40:43.869
Ben.

40:44.008 --> 40:47.273
The electroshock therapy worked.

40:47.411 --> 40:48.776
You shouldn't hear
the voices now.

40:50.347 --> 40:51.871
How do you feel?

40:54.685 --> 40:56.414
Good. Good.

40:56.554 --> 40:57.885
That's good, Ben.

41:27.051 --> 41:29.952
Wh... What are you doing here?

41:31.121 --> 41:32.418
The nurse said you'd go away.

41:32.556 --> 41:35.354
You don't want that, do you, Ben?

41:36.827 --> 41:38.294
It's not up to me.

41:38.429 --> 41:39.987
They said I was sick,

41:40.130 --> 41:42.325
that they'd fix me.

41:42.466 --> 41:45.560
Our spirits have been with you
your whole life, Ben.

41:49.106 --> 41:52.598
No. You've been with me
since the church fire.

41:52.977 --> 41:55.172
You sure about that, Ben?

41:56.305 --> 42:02.244
