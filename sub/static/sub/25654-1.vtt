[crying]

00:20.103 --> 00:23.022
[people chattering]

00:25.442 --> 00:31.657
[Golda Rincon] My sister was killed

00:25.442 --> 00:31.657
on July 5th, 2014.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.159
We actually were having fun that day

00:34.201 --> 00:38.246
and we were kind of out at my mom's friend's house

00:38.288 --> 00:39.581
for a barbecue.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.500
We were going to the store,

00:41.542 --> 00:46.881
and that's when everything happened.

00:46.922 --> 00:48.716
Like, it all changed.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.681
[boy 1] I like chicken, do you?

00:55.723 --> 00:57.140
[boy 2 laughing]

00:57.182 --> 00:59.142
- [boy 2] No. -[both laugh]

01:01.020 --> 01:03.146
-This is where it happened. -[dog barking]

01:03.188 --> 01:05.440
Right here.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.442
The shots came from over there.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.861
[barking continues]

01:15.951 --> 01:19.788
[Alexis Rincon] Soon after the murder

01:15.951 --> 01:19.788
of my daughter Genesis,

01:19.830 --> 01:21.832
Jhymiere Moore turned himself in,

01:21.874 --> 01:23.417
surrendered himself.

01:25.168 --> 01:29.381
Jeffry Ellerbee also surrendered himself

01:29.423 --> 01:31.466
for being an accomplice there.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.301
And Marshae Anthony was picked up

01:33.343 --> 01:36.304
about a month and a half after all of that.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.515
And he was picked up on gun charges

01:38.557 --> 01:40.517
that were linked to the murder.

01:43.687 --> 01:47.357
[Jack DeSalvo] All right, Jah, why don't you tell us

01:47.399 --> 01:48.817
where you were that night.

01:48.859 --> 01:52.780
That night, at that crime scene,

01:52.821 --> 01:54.531
I had to be in the house 'cause

01:54.573 --> 01:55.866
I stayed in the house that whole day,

01:55.908 --> 01:57.785
I didn't go outside one bit.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.411
Okay.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.788
Well, I wasn't there.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.330
People are putting you out there.

02:02.372 --> 02:03.707
And I'm not just saying one person,

02:03.749 --> 02:05.834
I'm not just saying two people,

02:05.876 --> 02:08.002
I'm saying a lot of people

02:08.044 --> 02:10.631
and you know the city, the city's got cameras everywhere.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.633
We don't have a camera, a city camera,

02:12.674 --> 02:15.302
there's a house camera, there's a liquor store camera,

02:15.343 --> 02:17.888
there's a bodega camera. There's cameras everywhere.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.681
-No I wasn't over there-- -No, listen to me.

02:19.723 --> 02:20.808
You know what happened.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.936
A 12-year-old girl

02:23.978 --> 02:26.105
was accidentally shot

02:26.187 --> 02:29.274
-and she died because of this. -Yes.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.735
Again, like I said, we weren't there. We don't know.

02:31.777 --> 02:34.571
Right now, it's always coming back to you.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.197
But I wasn't there.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.908
It can come back to me as much as they have to,

02:37.950 --> 02:40.035
-but I wasn't there, that's all. -Okay.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.996
-I promise you, I wasn't there. -And I want you to be honest.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.957
And that's why I respect what you did tonight.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.792
-Yes, sir. -You came to us.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.796
We didn't have to go looking for ya, driving around.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.547
And that shows us, you know what?

02:52.589 --> 02:53.882
You want to get in front of this.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.300
You want to tell us the truth

02:55.342 --> 02:58.261
and you're telling us your truth.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.930
-Yes. -Okay, that's important.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.473
-I'm telling you the truth. -The truth.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.600
-Not my truth. The truth. -All right.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.853
There's a difference between my truth and the truth.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.186
I'm telling you the truth.

03:07.228 --> 03:10.065
[ethereal theme playing]

03:21.160 --> 03:23.078
[Janny Calderon] "Detective Rico, Detective Alba,

03:23.120 --> 03:27.082
"on ceasefire, arrived on scene as well as Detective DeSalvo,

03:27.124 --> 03:29.501
"Detective Liebson and Detective Seabrooks,

03:29.543 --> 03:31.795
"and Detective Gilmore.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.506
"This officer filed a witness, Jordi Perez,

03:34.548 --> 03:36.967
"and he stated that he went to the bodega,

03:37.009 --> 03:39.636
"and it was closed, so they were returning back

03:39.678 --> 03:43.807
"when him and the victims were in front of 35 Rosbrook,

03:43.849 --> 03:46.018
"he heard loud pops, and he thought it was fireworks.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.104
And then he saw the victim drop to the floor."

03:53.067 --> 03:54.693
That's everything?

03:59.031 --> 04:02.492
[Javier Castellanos] It created so much turmoil,

04:02.534 --> 04:04.244
when Genesis got shot.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.747
It was just like this devastating news.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.208
And not to undermine what happened with Genesis,

04:09.249 --> 04:11.835
because it's tragic, losing a child has gotta be

04:11.877 --> 04:14.504
the worst thing, but these stray bullets

04:14.546 --> 04:16.339
have been going around forever.

04:16.380 --> 04:20.094
In 2010, they had documented close to 140 different gangs.

04:20.135 --> 04:22.763
The uniqueness about the gang culture

04:22.804 --> 04:26.934
in the Paterson area is that you can cross

04:26.975 --> 04:28.560
from one block to the other,

04:28.602 --> 04:30.938
and you're in another gang's territory.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.607
[Shermaine Jones] Everybody hustle

04:30.979 --> 04:33.607
for different reasons.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.110
You've got some dude want to hustle for clothes.

04:36.151 --> 04:38.904
You've got some dudes want to hustle for they house.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.615
And then you got some dudes who really hustling

04:41.656 --> 04:44.284
because you go to they household, they need,

04:44.325 --> 04:46.912
you know, they taking care of they family.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.581
What's a 12-year-old supposed to do

04:49.623 --> 04:53.334
to help his mom feed his brothers and sisters?

04:53.376 --> 04:55.420
There's only one option.

04:55.462 --> 04:58.590
You go pick up some drugs and sell it.

04:58.632 --> 05:00.592
This is a baby New York City now,

05:00.634 --> 05:02.844
and you know what makes that worse,

05:02.886 --> 05:04.930
because New York is big.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.432
Paterson, if I'm beefing with some,

05:07.474 --> 05:09.559
I'm from the fourth and beefing with somebody

05:09.601 --> 05:14.148
from down the hill, we gonna see each a lot sooner.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.483
It's like we in a cage.

05:16.524 --> 05:19.153
When you in a cage tight, there's nowhere to run.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.947
You got to get him or he gonna get you.

[man 1] My brothers and sisters,

06:05.615 --> 06:09.536
we stop on this corner

06:09.577 --> 06:13.040
because this is one of the places where the blood

06:13.081 --> 06:15.374
of our youth cries out from the ground.

06:15.416 --> 06:18.377
Father, we pray for healing on this corner.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.339
For prosperity on this corner.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.381
For life on this corner.

06:22.423 --> 06:24.843
-For hope on this corner. -[man 2] That's right,

06:22.423 --> 06:24.843
that's right.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.928
-Hope of a better day. -That's right.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.680
Of a brighter day.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.557
Of a more prosperous day.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.101
In the name of Jesus.

06:33.143 --> 06:36.188
[Alexis] Before I had Genesis,

06:33.143 --> 06:36.188
I wasn't a bad kid.

06:36.230 --> 06:39.316
You know, growing up in the hood is pretty messed up.

06:39.358 --> 06:42.110
You do things you don't think you would do.

06:42.152 --> 06:46.656
You know, you steal cars.

06:46.698 --> 06:49.826
Being on the block, we used to sell crack, you know.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.829
It wasn't like a career, it was just like,

06:52.871 --> 06:54.248
you do what you do.

06:54.289 --> 06:58.001
So then, met Jenny, Genesis' mom,

06:58.043 --> 07:01.922
then we started dating, and then she came out pregnant.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.299
That changed me.

07:04.341 --> 07:08.178
When I held Genesis, that's when it hit me, like,

07:08.220 --> 07:10.680
holy shit, I'm a father.

07:10.722 --> 07:14.142
[laughter]

07:14.184 --> 07:17.145
They're acting like total fools on the bus.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.479
[vocalizing]

07:20.982 --> 07:23.484
[Alexis] Did you just press that?

07:23.526 --> 07:25.279
Oh.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.530
[indistinct chatter]

07:27.572 --> 07:30.784
[Alexis] Put this on the side and sit right.

07:30.825 --> 07:32.119
Here.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.536
Jesus Christ, y'all act like

07:33.578 --> 07:35.289
you've never been on a bus before.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.998
How much do you think this lawyer,

07:37.040 --> 07:38.499
how much does the lawyer cost?

07:38.541 --> 07:41.295
A lawyer can't be more than $20,000.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.130
Twenty, thirty thousand dollars.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.839
For murder?

07:44.881 --> 07:46.883
I don't need it for murder, I just need it

07:46.925 --> 07:48.509
to get my name out of the situation.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.511
No, no, no, this is a murder charge.

07:52.264 --> 07:53.390
[Harley Breite] Okay...

07:53.432 --> 07:54.849
So, you realize

07:54.891 --> 07:57.394
your whole entire future is at stake here.

07:57.436 --> 08:00.230
You get that, right? So here's what I'm going to do.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.690
I'm going to save you from all of this.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.444
Now, you want to know, Harley, how much is my freedom worth?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.612
Yeah, I can't put a price on your freedom.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.364
But here's the deal.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.950
You want the best, you're here, I'm the best.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.081
Someone shot a bullet through my house

08:18.123 --> 08:20.750
and it wasn't very nice.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.972
Light with the laser.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.934
You know, it becomes an issue when you're walking around

08:38.977 --> 08:42.063
and people recognize you, and gang members

08:42.105 --> 08:45.900
are upset with you because maybe you lost a trial,

08:45.942 --> 08:50.738
and their gang member friend blames you.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.200
This is small for the home.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.954
[light dramatic theme playing]

09:01.041 --> 09:03.626
Why did I decide to leave?

09:03.668 --> 09:05.545
Because I'm scared to be here.

09:05.586 --> 09:09.424
And because I need my kids to be raised somewhere else.

09:09.466 --> 09:13.387
Not here, it's too much going on here.

09:13.428 --> 09:14.929
Scary.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.806
I want them to be able to play outside...

09:18.599 --> 09:20.601
...without me having to worry about getting them

09:20.643 --> 09:23.230
getting hurt or somebody's coming for us, you know?

09:23.271 --> 09:26.316
So I'd rather just leave and leave everything behind.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.735
As long as they're good, I'm good.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.571
I don't want to lose another one.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.116
Florida is ready for you.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.451
Or you're ready for Florida.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.370
-[laughter] -Really.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.163
-Are you excited? -You're gonna be fine.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.248
Yeah.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.707
-Are you? -Yeah.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.209
Really? Like you're not gonna miss--

09:44.251 --> 09:45.626
Yeah, I'll gonna miss you guys.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.587
-Oh, you guys. -Us guys.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.005
But you're not gonna miss the dump.

09:49.047 --> 09:51.007
-No. -Not at all.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.133
It stinks.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.593
[Alexis] I look at it as

09:53.634 --> 09:55.095
being a blessing.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.305
It's a new beginning, it's a new start.

09:57.347 --> 10:01.435
This, out here, this town is just devastating.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.479
Everywhere she turns, it's a memory.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.939
Everywhere she turns, she hears,

10:05.980 --> 10:07.524
"Okay, there was a shootout here."

10:07.566 --> 10:09.401
Or something happened here.

10:09.443 --> 10:13.238
And it's like, no 11-year-old should grow up like that.

All right, but here's the thing, you know,

10:34.759 --> 10:36.636
it's a very important case.

10:36.677 --> 10:39.222
As I've stated this in the past, to both the defense

10:39.264 --> 10:43.184
and the prosecutor. We've got to get this case moving.

10:43.226 --> 10:46.020
What about, any, Mr. Bright?

10:46.062 --> 10:48.731
Yes, Judge, I would think it only be fair to all parties

10:48.773 --> 10:51.485
to set this matter down for a trial date.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.404
My client's been sitting in a jail a year and a half.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.948
[Judge] Absolutely, absolutely.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.159
Mr. Barnett Perview, I know you want a trial date

10:59.200 --> 11:01.161
in this case, but here's what I'm gonna do.

11:01.202 --> 11:04.456
I'm gonna give this a pre-trial conference plea cut off,

11:04.498 --> 11:08.042
the first week of February and we will set the trial date

11:08.084 --> 11:09.544
at that time. Any further?

11:09.586 --> 11:11.505
No, thank you, Your Honor.

11:11.546 --> 11:14.966
[Harley] Interestingly enough, as if the state could not delay

11:15.008 --> 11:17.844
this case further, or put more pressure on my client,

11:17.885 --> 11:20.847
his bail was $3,000,000, I believe, cash only.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.599
That's not a bail.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.976
That's just code for we're gonna keep you here

11:25.018 --> 11:27.562
as long as it takes for your trial to come.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.814
[Niechia MacPherson] The streets probably

11:27.604 --> 11:29.814
got Jhymiere when he was

11:29.856 --> 11:32.233
probably about 15, 16.

11:32.275 --> 11:35.529
And that's when we found out that his dad

11:35.570 --> 11:38.573
was gone, like, that's when we got the news

11:38.615 --> 11:41.368
that his dad was arrested and it didn't look good,

11:41.409 --> 11:45.913
and he was possibly gonna be gone for about 30 years,

11:45.955 --> 11:48.791
and Jhymiere just felt like his father

11:48.833 --> 11:50.918
like didn't care about him.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.339
[Benita Gray] Jeffry's a good kid.

11:54.381 --> 11:58.009
His father committed suicide when he was one.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.970
He's always been a great kid.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.764
Always helped with the rest of my kids.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.142
Never got in trouble.

12:06.184 --> 12:09.812
Always went to school, never gave me a hard time.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.482
He was always a really good kid with a good attitude.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.234
-[Harley] A few minutes. -[Judge] Yeah, I think that's--

12:14.275 --> 12:15.569
-[Harley] That's fine. -[Judge] All right then.

12:15.610 --> 12:16.986
[Harley] Very good, thank you.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.572
[Niechia] Jhymiere's state of mind

12:18.613 --> 12:19.906
right now is more or less like he knows that

12:19.947 --> 12:21.658
he's gonna be cleared.

12:21.700 --> 12:24.035
I said to Jhymiere, "I'm with Harley on this."

12:24.077 --> 12:25.744
They're gunning for you.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.206
[Harley] The public was screaming for a scapegoat.

12:28.248 --> 12:31.376
The police needed a scapegoat.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.587
So why not choose Jhymiere Moore,

12:33.628 --> 12:38.299
a 19-year-old black kid with a criminal record?

12:38.341 --> 12:40.594
Who better to pin this on than him?

12:43.597 --> 12:45.890
[Jacques Jones] They didn't look into

12:43.597 --> 12:45.890
this investigation properly.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.601
They just went off word of mouth.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.936
In their eyes, he guilty.

12:49.977 --> 12:52.021
Especially because that's a little girl.

12:52.063 --> 12:57.193
If I had to shoot somebody,

12:57.235 --> 13:00.947
I would walk up to them, point blank, and shoot 'em

13:00.988 --> 13:02.532
in the fucking face.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.620
You have that big of a problem

13:06.661 --> 13:09.623
that you gotta kill somebody, right? Right?

13:09.664 --> 13:13.501
You have that big of a problem, that big of a problem,

13:13.543 --> 13:16.337
that you gotta take somebody's life?

13:16.379 --> 13:18.923
Well, take their life.

13:18.965 --> 13:22.093
It's been happening since the beginning of time, right?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.471
People been killing people since the beginning of time.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.431
Cain and Abel.

13:29.976 --> 13:34.981
But you walk up to 'em and you do 'em in.

13:35.022 --> 13:38.067
You just don't do it from across the street,

13:38.109 --> 13:41.613
where there's a bunch of kids playing on a scooter.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.658
[Shermaine] I just went to a funeral last month.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.284
This happened.

13:46.326 --> 13:50.037
I know a lot of people, it's common.

13:50.079 --> 13:54.668
It's like you been to fucking Vietnam

13:54.709 --> 13:57.545
or something, you know?

13:57.587 --> 13:59.631
Your war wounds.

13:59.673 --> 14:02.425
You either got stab marks or gunshots,

14:02.467 --> 14:04.427
jumping out of Paterson.

14:04.469 --> 14:08.097
To properly police these individuals and these gangs,

14:08.139 --> 14:09.766
you have to know their culture, you have to know

14:09.808 --> 14:11.518
what the gangs are about.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.354
The general make up, the hierarchy.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.231
Identifying them, monitoring them is getting harder

14:17.273 --> 14:19.233
and harder because there has been a decrease

14:19.275 --> 14:21.653
in the police force, due to cutbacks and things like that,

14:21.695 --> 14:23.363
but we're tasked to do more.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.239
So sometimes those specialized humans

14:25.281 --> 14:27.742
that were focusing on that, they're not there anymore.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.620
[police radio chatter]

14:30.662 --> 14:33.373
[Camelia Valdes] We have to talk about how gangs

14:33.414 --> 14:35.249
are being able to make money.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.711
Heroin is five dollars a bag.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.547
It's fueling the drug trade,

14:40.588 --> 14:43.842
and so when we talk about gangs,

14:43.883 --> 14:46.010
we have to talk about not only gun violence,

14:46.052 --> 14:48.763
reducing gun violence, but we have to keep focus on

14:48.805 --> 14:51.808
what drugs now are being abused.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.268
[man] He's bringing community down.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.063
Everybody's coming up here for a needle exchange,

14:57.104 --> 14:59.232
for needles, clean needles.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.441
Fuck, why you gotta get clean needles?

15:00.483 --> 15:02.443
Don't shoot up.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.903
Shouldn't shoot up, right, right,

15:03.944 --> 15:05.363
but it's for the people,

15:05.405 --> 15:06.740
it's for the people in the backyards,

15:06.781 --> 15:07.866
start thinking about that.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.996
[chattering]

15:15.956 --> 15:18.668
[Golda] I live in Tampa, Florida.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.838
I am living with my uncle, my aunt, and my three cousins.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.425
And then my aunt's grandmother and her daughter.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.594
[laughter]

15:27.635 --> 15:31.097
My mom is trying to get an apartment and a job.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.349
She wants to work two jobs so she can make enough money

15:33.391 --> 15:35.142
to get her own apartment.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.897
I want to get the hook out, I want to get the hook out,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.064
I want to get the hook out.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.609
[laughter]

15:42.650 --> 15:44.444
My life here in Florida is better

15:44.485 --> 15:46.905
than actually being in Paterson.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.741
Paterson, I'd be terrified to go even,

15:49.783 --> 15:53.411
even across the street by myself.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.914
It's... It's...

15:55.955 --> 15:58.374
But here, I guess, like, I don't know,

15:58.416 --> 16:02.253
it's calm, so I go anywhere.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.464
[ethereal theme playing]

16:08.301 --> 16:10.386
This is the room, the room's intact.

16:10.428 --> 16:13.807
No holes, no damages, just a little wiping down.

16:13.848 --> 16:15.224
Everything is intact.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.893
[Alexis] It really sucks getting evicted.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.018
You know, being homeless.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.353
Destroyed.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.689
My daughter's in Florida.

16:21.731 --> 16:25.443
My other daughter is a buried in a cemetery.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.862
I'm going to court.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.531
It really messes with your head.

16:30.573 --> 16:35.787
It really messes you up, as a man, you know?

16:35.829 --> 16:37.455
[chattering]

16:39.123 --> 16:42.293
A year ago today, I was at work,

16:42.335 --> 16:45.755
getting paid, like, I was doing what I graduated school for.

16:45.797 --> 16:49.258
My life was going where I wanted it to go,

16:49.300 --> 16:51.010
to the point where I was like, oh right,

16:51.051 --> 16:52.971
I'm gonna be where I got to be,

16:53.012 --> 16:56.056
and I'm gonna be able to support my family, my children,

16:56.098 --> 16:57.517
everything is gonna be okay now,

16:57.558 --> 16:59.143
this is what I went to school for.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.146
And then everything just fucking crumbles

17:02.188 --> 17:04.106
from your fingertips.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.526
You folks are the folks that are leaving?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.319
-You're all moved? -[Alexis] Yes.

17:08.361 --> 17:12.198
-Here's your copy of this. -Thank you.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.492
A little wet, but, since you're moving,

17:14.534 --> 17:16.327
you're not gonna need it anymore.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.539
[people chattering]

17:25.211 --> 17:27.964
[woman laughs]

17:33.594 --> 17:36.096
[Judge] Statement 15030149.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.683
We conferenced this case in chambers,

17:38.725 --> 17:41.101
and it's my understanding there were still

17:41.143 --> 17:43.646
some open discovery issues.

17:43.688 --> 17:46.733
Defense Council, any other issues right now?

17:46.774 --> 17:48.317
With regard to discovery?

17:48.359 --> 17:50.486
Or any other issues in this case?

17:50.528 --> 17:52.572
-I'd like to raise an issue-- -[Judge] All right, sure.

17:52.613 --> 17:56.200
The last time we were here, I most vociferously

17:56.242 --> 17:59.370
requested a trial date of April 1st.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.121
-That's correct. -There seemed to be

18:01.163 --> 18:04.083
some resistance from some of the parties on that.

18:04.124 --> 18:07.169
I am respectfully requesting that the court put down

18:07.211 --> 18:12.717
September 20th, Tuesday, as a real trial date.

18:12.759 --> 18:17.722
There should be no reason why myself and co-council,

18:17.764 --> 18:21.141
all co-council, the state as well, cannot be ready

18:21.183 --> 18:23.436
by that time to try this case.

18:23.477 --> 18:27.356
These are three young men who've been incarcerated,

18:27.398 --> 18:31.069
been denied their pre-trial liberty by a massive,

18:31.110 --> 18:34.697
excessive bail that nobody in this courtroom could make,

18:34.739 --> 18:37.199
they've waited long and hard for a trial,

18:37.241 --> 18:40.286
they deserve a trial, the state deserves a trial,

18:40.327 --> 18:43.289
and we're sitting here again not able to do that.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.833
I would love to set a trial date and say,

18:45.875 --> 18:50.797
"That's the day and we're gonna proceed on that day."

18:50.838 --> 18:54.008
But the state has to make its final plea offer

18:54.050 --> 18:57.053
and the defendants then have to make an informed decision

18:57.095 --> 18:59.221
as to whether they want to try this case

18:59.263 --> 19:03.309
or they want to take the plea, so we're getting closer

19:03.350 --> 19:06.312
to that point, but we're not there yet.

19:06.353 --> 19:08.815
And Judge, if I may, I appreciate that,

19:08.856 --> 19:11.400
and again, just as a practical matter,

19:11.442 --> 19:14.403
if this trial doesn't go in the very beginning

19:14.445 --> 19:18.074
of October, at the latest, this case will not

19:18.116 --> 19:20.743
go to trial in 2016.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.495
The earliest we can hope for

19:22.536 --> 19:26.707
is a mid-January 2017 trial.

19:26.749 --> 19:28.709
I agree with you. And just, you know,

19:28.751 --> 19:31.879
we talked about this in chambers, just being practical,

19:31.921 --> 19:33.714
there's still some more work to do in this case, obviously.

19:33.756 --> 19:37.135
-Not much. Not much. -Well, that you feel

19:37.176 --> 19:41.221
that way, your co-council don't necessarily feel that way.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.016
[Judge] All right, anything else?

19:43.057 --> 19:44.600
-No, sir. -[Judge] All right then.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.477
-[Paul] Thank you. -[Judge] You're welcome.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.563
[Harley] Look, everybody has an interest.

19:49.605 --> 19:52.358
The prosecutor has an interest in preserving justice,

19:52.399 --> 19:54.735
the other attorneys have an interest in ensuring

19:54.777 --> 19:56.696
that their clients get a fair trial,

19:56.737 --> 19:58.572
I have that same interest.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.658
But we need to get things done.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.953
And sometimes when people are getting paid by the hour

20:03.995 --> 20:07.874
or they're on salary even, one has a different motivation

20:07.915 --> 20:09.667
than the other.

20:09.709 --> 20:14.254
And that's creating, I think, a partial conflict here.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.220
Mad, upset.

20:21.261 --> 20:25.183
Sad, confused, lost.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.852
Like, what the fuck is going on?

20:27.894 --> 20:30.604
Like, what is going on?

20:30.646 --> 20:34.901
From day one, it was said, yeah, hey, yeah,

20:34.942 --> 20:38.154
we got 'em, we this, we that, yeah, we got all this,

20:38.196 --> 20:39.864
we got all that.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.700
And then today you have nothing to say.

20:44.202 --> 20:45.452
You late.

20:45.494 --> 20:48.330
You're not even prepared.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.832
What's going on?

20:51.542 --> 20:55.755
Now, it's at the point where,

20:55.796 --> 21:00.342
are these guys really who did it,

21:00.384 --> 21:04.805
or it was just randomly picked out from the street?

21:04.847 --> 21:06.224
They wear you down.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.558
It's a war of attrition.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.143
Well, guess what?

21:09.185 --> 21:10.603
We don't tap out.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.271
We don't submit.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.733
We're going to trial.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.693
If they want to delay this trial

21:17.735 --> 21:19.403
one more year, two more years,

21:19.445 --> 21:22.656
three more years, that's on them.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.075
But we're going to trial.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.827
My client wants a trial.

21:26.869 --> 21:31.958
And one day, one day, there will be no more delays.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.044
That jury will come up the elevator, walk through

21:35.086 --> 21:37.379
the hallway, walk into that courtroom,

21:37.421 --> 21:40.007
and take their rightful seats.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.884
And then the prosecutor will have to get up

21:41.926 --> 21:44.887
and prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.056
That day is coming.

21:47.098 --> 21:49.058
One day.

21:49.100 --> 21:51.144
[melancholy theme playing]

22:00.861 --> 22:03.114
[people chattering]

22:18.963 --> 22:20.214
[digital shutter clicks]

22:47.574 --> 22:49.035
[Golda] We left everything behind.

22:49.076 --> 22:52.496
We left Genesis' tombstone behind.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.958
We left my family behind.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.918
We left a lot of things behind.

23:01.547 --> 23:06.802
I feel confused, happy, and upset.

23:06.844 --> 23:10.348
Because like, I don't know, like, confused,

23:10.388 --> 23:12.641
confused, I don't even know what to feel.

23:12.683 --> 23:16.603
I'm happy that we left, but like, I don't want to leave.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.898
I don't want to leave my dad, my brothers, my cousins.

23:20.607 --> 23:23.110
She hasn't cried. She didn't cry.

23:23.152 --> 23:27.281
She cried with me the first time, and that's it.

23:27.323 --> 23:29.283
The first day. Never cried again.

23:29.325 --> 23:32.452
Okay, hi everybody, it's Genesis, and I'm gonna be--

23:32.494 --> 23:34.454
[Janny] I don't know, she doesn't want to make friends.

23:34.496 --> 23:37.208
It's like hard for her to make friends.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.959
She says, how can she make friends

23:39.001 --> 23:40.711
if the only friend and best friend she had

23:40.753 --> 23:41.921
was her sister, Genesis.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.214
He's still on level two.

23:43.256 --> 23:45.049
Okay, now he's on level three. Which is a scary one anyway.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.720
[Golda] I want it to be over.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.014
Yeah, I want them to plead guilty.

23:52.056 --> 23:57.186
I don't want them to be going to trial anymore,

23:57.228 --> 23:59.730
or others, I want it to be done.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.441
It's just too much now.

24:03.483 --> 24:06.486
We've been at this for two years almost.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.322
And it's still going.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.074
It's ongoing.

24:11.658 --> 24:14.161
All right, good afternoon. Please be seated.

24:14.203 --> 24:17.206
All right, we're here for the pre-trial conference

24:17.248 --> 24:19.750
and matters of Jhymiere Moore, Marshae Anthony,

24:19.792 --> 24:24.797
Jeffry Ellerbee, indictment 15030149.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.345
Judge, do you have everybody up there?

24:31.387 --> 24:32.972
-I think you do. -[Judge] Yeah.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.223
[Judge] All right, why don't we start out

24:34.265 --> 24:35.849
with Jhymiere Moore?

24:35.891 --> 24:37.768
[Paul] The charges include murder.

24:37.810 --> 24:40.478
They include weapons offenses.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.689
These three defendants, the state's allegations

24:42.731 --> 24:47.111
are that they were part of a crew that was hitting back

24:47.153 --> 24:51.531
and looking for, specifically, maybe, Mr. Shakeen Ricks.

24:51.573 --> 24:55.244
Mr. Shakeen Ricks, as we know, is a defendant now

24:55.286 --> 24:58.496
in Burgham County for the murder of Nasira Bug,

24:58.538 --> 25:01.292
another young girl, and he will be going to trial,

25:01.334 --> 25:04.211
just like his co-defendants, sometime in December.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.922
So this matter has been not able to resolve

25:06.964 --> 25:09.175
by way of plea or cooperation,

25:09.216 --> 25:11.802
and there is no further negotiations.

25:11.844 --> 25:15.264
[Judge] What was the state's final plea offer in this?

25:17.350 --> 25:19.977
The state's original plea offer was 40 years

25:20.019 --> 25:23.314
for Mr. Moore, 40 years for Mr. Ellerbee,

25:23.356 --> 25:27.234
and eight with four for Mr. Anthony.

25:27.276 --> 25:30.279
[Judge] The maximum sentence we expose,

25:30.321 --> 25:33.032
if convicted on all counts in this case,

25:33.073 --> 25:37.036
Mr. DeGroot, can you set forth, what that would be?

25:37.077 --> 25:39.205
-[Paul] Life in prison. -[Judge] Right.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.376
All right, Mr. Moore, you understand all that?

25:43.417 --> 25:45.711
-[Jhymiere] Yes. -Mr. Moore. You had enough time

25:45.752 --> 25:47.880
-to think about it? -Yes.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.840
-Talk to your attorney about it? -Yes.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.717
[Judge] You understand that after today,

25:51.758 --> 25:53.427
there will be no more plea offers.

25:53.469 --> 25:54.594
You okay with that?

25:54.636 --> 25:56.013
-Yes. -All right.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.473
So, what do you want to do?

25:57.515 --> 25:58.598
You want to go to trial in this case?

25:58.640 --> 26:00.351
-Yes. -Okay, fine.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.144
[Judge] Anything further?

26:02.186 --> 26:04.271
-[man] No. -[Judge] All right, very well.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.981
[Judge] Set it for September 7.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.649
All right, thank you.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.402
-[lawyers] Thank you. -You're welcome.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.278
[chattering]

26:16.492 --> 26:19.537
[Niechia] Nobody really is considering the fact that

26:19.577 --> 26:21.663
what if these boys are innocent?

26:21.705 --> 26:24.166
Y'all just ruined their lives.

26:24.208 --> 26:28.212
Like I told my child, their life is forever ruined.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.297
Whether you get found innocent.

26:30.339 --> 26:32.132
Whether you get found guilty.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.134
Whether it's a mistrial or dismissal,

26:34.176 --> 26:36.345
whatever it is, your life is forever ruined.

26:36.387 --> 26:40.099
Jeffry never even got a ticket, let alone now

26:40.140 --> 26:43.436
the first crime he commits is a murder, that's ridiculous.

26:43.477 --> 26:45.354
So yeah, it's a shock.

26:45.396 --> 26:48.941
It's been very depressing.

26:48.982 --> 26:52.486
It's been hard on the rest of my kids.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.155
To explain to them that their brother might not

26:55.197 --> 26:58.033
come home for something he didn't do.

26:58.075 --> 26:59.617
So it's been hard.

26:59.659 --> 27:02.662
In this situation, in this situation,

27:02.704 --> 27:04.622
you got to take that chance.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.250
This is life, now.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.752
Now, if he know he didn't do it,

27:08.794 --> 27:13.424
why take 25, 40 whatever, they offer him 40 years.

27:13.466 --> 27:14.758
[police radio chatter]

27:14.800 --> 27:16.302
[David Kennedy] There is no way

27:16.343 --> 27:21.307
that any amount of routine application

27:21.348 --> 27:25.643
of policing criminal justice will stop what's going on.

27:25.685 --> 27:29.356
The routine experience of people in the neighborhood

27:29.398 --> 27:31.984
is that they're subjected

27:32.025 --> 27:34.236
to a huge amount of law enforcement.

27:34.278 --> 27:35.571
Man, feel my twists.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.364
[David] And they're not safe.

27:37.406 --> 27:38.782
You recording me?

27:38.824 --> 27:40.326
[KnowledgeBorn] Man, the street life,

27:40.367 --> 27:41.577
a thug cannot even learn how to spit, man.

27:41.619 --> 27:43.078
And I'm sharp with the hands.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.538
Even better with the hawk.

27:44.580 --> 27:46.540
A vicious dude with a reckless bark.

27:46.582 --> 27:48.501
Psychotic with the hammer, don't get caught in that spark.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.961
Late night creeping, yeah, I be that shadow in the dark.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.838
40 cal with something to silence the pop

27:52.879 --> 27:54.298
and this thing's slick talking, dawg,

27:54.340 --> 27:56.008
this is coming from the heart.

27:56.049 --> 27:58.051
90 dog, understand what's up, and then you spar

27:58.093 --> 28:00.137
with my boss, open your face with the hawk.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.931
Or a slug in your chest, man, to silence your heart.

28:02.973 --> 28:05.809
[Shermaine] You know, it's a sad situation,

28:05.851 --> 28:09.021
but that stuff happen out here.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.649
A kid should be able to go out and play.

28:11.731 --> 28:15.528
But that's just, that's just not the reality

28:15.569 --> 28:18.614
of what's going on in Paterson.

28:18.656 --> 28:22.117
Cory is my first cousin. Her father was murdered.

28:22.159 --> 28:26.330
My other first cousin, her father was murdered.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.248
My son was murdered.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.958
All in the same calendar year.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.793
What's the chances of that?

28:31.835 --> 28:34.338
That's almost like hitting the lottery of death.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.424
I know too well what these parents are going through.

28:37.466 --> 28:38.925
With their juveniles.

28:38.967 --> 28:42.555
Because at 14, my son started.

28:42.596 --> 28:46.141
[Shermaine] The younger kids, that's getting the guns.

28:46.183 --> 28:47.726
They not aiming.

28:47.767 --> 28:51.230
They see somebody they looking for in the crowd,

28:51.271 --> 28:53.023
they shoot at the crowd.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.693
Could hit five kids.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.570
I went to the cops, I called them every day.

28:57.611 --> 29:00.406
Every night they didn't come in, I got the same thing.

29:00.447 --> 29:03.450
Until it gets in the system, we can't help you.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.285
Maybe you want them to survive.

29:05.327 --> 29:07.787
That way, so you can throw them in the prison system

29:07.829 --> 29:09.289
and make money off of 'em.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.083
[applause]

29:11.124 --> 29:12.792
Maybe it's a business.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.670
Maybe it's a business.

29:16.755 --> 29:20.426
[woman] So at 18 he decided to go out and join a gang.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.428
First charge, two sets of guns.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.388
At 17.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.182
Second charge, two sets of guns.

29:27.224 --> 29:29.226
Third charge, attempted murder.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.854
But he's in the system now, huh?

29:32.896 --> 29:35.566
You guys talk about everything that's around

29:35.608 --> 29:37.443
the buck and the dollar, but at the end of the day,

29:37.484 --> 29:40.446
when they start shooting up your car, your house,

29:40.487 --> 29:43.741
when heroin comes to your block,

29:43.782 --> 29:45.701
you're gonna turn around and say,

29:45.743 --> 29:47.994
"You know what, that guy with the dreads made a lot of sense."

29:49.371 --> 29:51.081
-All right, Mom, bye. -Good luck.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.250
Love you.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.335
See ya.

29:55.377 --> 29:57.463
[Janny] I wasn't gonna come.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.172
Over here.

29:59.214 --> 30:02.175
I wasn't gonna try to miss it, either.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.762
Broke my belt.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.683
All right.

30:09.725 --> 30:14.563
[ominous theme playing]

30:31.455 --> 30:32.914
[Judge] "Ladies and gentlemen,

30:32.956 --> 30:34.291
"defendants have pleaded

30:34.333 --> 30:36.042
"not guilty to the charges.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.086

"to be innocent, unless each and every essential element

"of the offenses are charged, offenses charged,

of that particular charge."

30:53.727 --> 30:55.437
It's a summer evening.

30:55.479 --> 30:58.816
Genesis Rincon is 12 years old.

30:58.898 --> 31:02.068
Innocent, pure.

31:02.110 --> 31:07.366
Society, our society, we failed that little girl.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.702
Just couldn't stop them.

31:11.411 --> 31:15.791
Genesis came upon, that moment in time,

31:15.833 --> 31:19.503
when his enemy

31:19.545 --> 31:22.798
and his enemy and his enemy appeared

31:22.840 --> 31:25.884
in the figure of a white van.

31:27.511 --> 31:31.306
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

31:31.348 --> 31:32.808
Bam.

31:32.850 --> 31:35.602
Shot after shot was fired.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.939
They're on trial here today.

31:42.275 --> 31:45.278
And the state is going to prove to you,

31:45.320 --> 31:50.450
beyond a reasonable doubt, that guilty on those counts

31:50.492 --> 31:53.245
for murder should be entered against each

31:53.286 --> 31:55.831
and every one of those.

31:55.873 --> 31:59.167
We will have justice for the Rincon family.

32:01.670 --> 32:03.296
Thank you.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.298
[Judge] Thank you, Mr. DeGroot.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.925
Mr. Breite.

32:09.845 --> 32:13.932
[Harley] Ladies and gentlemen, we do not need to decide

32:13.973 --> 32:16.769
whether this killing was terrible.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.729
We know that it was.

32:18.771 --> 32:21.440
And we know that it was tragic.

32:21.481 --> 32:24.735
Your purpose is different.

32:24.777 --> 32:30.073
It is to decide if the state has proved that my client

32:30.115 --> 32:32.325
killed Genesis Rincon.

32:32.367 --> 32:35.495
I am confident that when you hear the evidence,

32:35.537 --> 32:40.083
you'll find that there is not just one reasonable doubt,

32:40.125 --> 32:43.879
but there exists many, many reasonable doubts

32:43.921 --> 32:46.214
throughout the state's entire case.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.303
We don't know who killed Genesis Rincon,

32:51.344 --> 32:54.347
and at the end of this trial, unfortunately,

32:54.389 --> 32:59.603
you, too, will still not know who killed Genesis Rincon.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.314
Thank you.

[Judge] Thank you, Mr. Breite.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.653
of the witness,

33:07.694 --> 33:08.821
let's have...

33:08.862 --> 33:10.823
[indistinct dialogue] [woman]

33:10.864 --> 33:12.825
Raise your right hand, please.

33:12.866 --> 33:15.828
You do solemnly swear that the testimony

33:12.866 --> 33:15.828
about to be given

33:15.869 --> 33:17.412
in this case will be the truth,

33:17.454 --> 33:19.122
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

33:19.164 --> 33:20.666
-Yes. -Please state

33:19.164 --> 33:20.666
your name for the record.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.923
-a significant event that day? -Yes.

33:27.965 --> 33:30.175
-And what happened that day? -The shooting.

33:30.216 --> 33:32.845
[Paul] In the area of 35 Grand Ave.,

33:32.886 --> 33:34.513
in the city of Paterson,

33:34.554 --> 33:36.348
have you identified various neighborhood gangs

33:36.389 --> 33:38.224
-in that area? -Yes, we have two

33:38.266 --> 33:41.353
neighborhood gangs that we identified within that area.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.772
The first neighborhood gang that we've identified

33:43.814 --> 33:45.398
is 230 Boys.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.901
And the other group that we've identified

33:47.943 --> 33:50.904
is a group called the So Icy Boys.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.991
[Paul] I'd ask you to look toward the defense,

33:54.032 --> 33:56.785
and do you see the person that you

33:54.032 --> 33:56.785
identified as the shooter?

33:56.827 --> 33:58.411
-Yes. -Can you indicate

33:58.453 --> 33:59.997
what color shirt that person's wearing?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.373
White shirt.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.917
[Judge] Identifying the defendant.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.752
[Nancy] Defendant Moore has been identified

34:05.794 --> 34:08.714
by law enforcement sources as a member of So Icy

34:08.755 --> 34:12.050
by his self proclamation, as well as his tattoo

34:12.091 --> 34:14.594
that he has on his markings that say SIB,

34:14.636 --> 34:16.679
meaning So Icy Boys.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.268
[Paul] Now on July 5th, 2014,

34:22.310 --> 34:24.312
what time did that family barbecue begin?

34:24.353 --> 34:26.231
I'm not sure.

34:26.272 --> 34:28.859
I mean, it was around 4.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.860
[Paul] The police asked you if Jeffry Ellerbee

34:30.902 --> 34:33.655
-was there that day, correct? -[Aalyiah] Yes.

34:33.697 --> 34:36.992
[Paul] Originally, what did you first tell them?

34:37.034 --> 34:39.828
[Aalyiah] I told them that he came around 8.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.538
[Paul] Did you finally change your story?

34:41.580 --> 34:43.331
[Aalyiah] Yes.

34:43.373 --> 34:45.123
-[Paul] Good morning, Detective. -Good morning.

34:45.166 --> 34:47.085
[Paul] Were you involved in the homicide investigation

34:47.126 --> 34:48.754
-of Genesis Rincon? -Yes.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.463
[Paul] In that investigation,

34:50.505 --> 34:52.507
was there an application to search

34:52.549 --> 34:54.259
-one of the phones? -Yes.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.762
[Paul] Was that phone of Jeffry Ellerbee?

34:56.803 --> 34:57.930
Correct.

34:57.971 --> 34:59.765
Agent, based on your expertise,

34:59.806 --> 35:02.559
can you conclude to a reasonable degree of certainty

35:02.601 --> 35:05.270
whether that cellular number was in the area

35:05.311 --> 35:08.565
of the homicide on July 5th, 2014,

35:08.607 --> 35:10.275
at approximately 8:30 in the evening?

35:10.316 --> 35:13.946
I can tell you that the usage of that phone

35:13.987 --> 35:16.281
at that particular time is consistent with

35:16.322 --> 35:18.867
the coverage area of that crime scene at that time.

35:18.909 --> 35:21.703
[Paul] Were you able to establish where the phone was

35:21.745 --> 35:25.832
at approximately 8:30 in the evening on August 5th, 2014?

35:25.874 --> 35:28.293
-[Harley] Objection. -[Judge] Sustained.

35:28.334 --> 35:31.254
[Paul] Who asked you to say that Jeff was with you

35:31.296 --> 35:33.548
at that time?

35:33.590 --> 35:36.468
-Jeffry. -[Paul] Thank you.

35:36.509 --> 35:38.386
[Nancy] Defendant Ellerbee has been identified

35:38.428 --> 35:40.722
by law enforcement sources through a self proclamation

35:40.764 --> 35:44.434
of stating that he, in fact, was a So Icy Boy.

35:44.476 --> 35:48.063
-[Paul] No tattoos, though? -No tattoos.

35:48.105 --> 35:50.649
-[Paul] Thank you. -[Judge] All right, thanks.

35:50.690 --> 35:53.359
[Judge] All right, Detective, you're still under oath.

35:53.401 --> 35:56.029
We'll have Mr. Breite's cross examination.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.824
[Harley] Detective, you testified that my client,

35:58.865 --> 36:01.451
Jhymiere Moore, is a member of a street gang,

36:01.493 --> 36:03.912
-is that correct? -[Nancy] That is correct.

36:05.622 --> 36:08.083
You didn't have any role, whatsoever,

36:08.125 --> 36:11.503
in the investigation of this case involving

36:11.544 --> 36:15.590
the murder of Genesis Rincon, correct?

36:15.632 --> 36:17.634
-That is correct. -You have no personal

36:17.676 --> 36:19.845
information, whatsoever, with regard

36:19.886 --> 36:22.472
to how this murder took place, do you?

36:22.514 --> 36:23.932
No, sir.

36:23.974 --> 36:26.852
-You weren't there, were you? -No, sir.

36:26.893 --> 36:29.395
You didn't see who fired the shots, did you?

36:29.437 --> 36:31.106
-No, sir. -Nothing further.

36:31.148 --> 36:32.565
[Judge] All right, thanks.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.776
[Harley] Mr. Carter, let's talk

36:34.818 --> 36:36.361
about some pending charges.

36:36.402 --> 36:39.238
You were arrested on September 21st, 2015,

36:39.280 --> 36:41.783
for the distribution of possession with the intent

36:41.825 --> 36:43.242
to distribute drugs, correct?

36:43.284 --> 36:44.953
-Yes. -That case is still pending,

36:44.995 --> 36:46.705
it's not been resolved, correct?

36:46.746 --> 36:48.373
-Yes. -Another pending charge.

36:48.414 --> 36:52.127
You were arrested on July 6th of 2016

36:52.169 --> 36:54.171
for selling heroin, correct?

36:54.212 --> 36:57.007
-Yes. -Okay, and that's not

36:54.212 --> 36:57.007
yet been resolved either?

36:57.049 --> 36:58.758
-Yes. -As you sit here today,

36:58.800 --> 37:02.261
testifying, on behalf of the state,

37:02.303 --> 37:05.807
those two pending charges have not yet been resolved,

37:05.849 --> 37:08.143
-is that correct? -Yes.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.690
Mr. Carter, this document is S57.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.692
-You recognize that, don't you? -Yes.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.485
That's your statement to the police, correct?

37:17.527 --> 37:19.612
Yes.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.115
[Harley] When you said that to them,

37:22.157 --> 37:24.743
you said that you were sweeping up

37:24.784 --> 37:26.452
-a little bit, correct? -Yes.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.287
Well, but the fact is you weren't sweeping,

37:28.329 --> 37:29.789
you were selling drugs, correct?

37:29.831 --> 37:31.624
-I was doing both. -Ah.

37:31.666 --> 37:32.959
[light chuckles in courtroom]

37:33.001 --> 37:34.419
Nothing further, Judge.

37:34.460 --> 37:35.879
[Judge] All right, thank you.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.299
[Judge] Let's take 5. Well, we said we were gonna be here

37:40.341 --> 37:43.344
until 3:30, so let's take till 3:30.

37:43.386 --> 37:45.972
[people chattering]

37:51.228 --> 37:56.482
Right now Jhymiere is, he's not 100% confident,

37:56.524 --> 37:59.069
you know what I'm saying, it's like,

37:59.111 --> 38:01.238
he feels like, right now, he feels like me,

38:01.279 --> 38:03.448
like he has a 60-40 chance.

38:03.489 --> 38:05.200
I feel good.

38:06.868 --> 38:08.954
You know, I feel good about it.

38:08.995 --> 38:13.125
It's not something like I'm worried if,

38:13.166 --> 38:16.795
or it could just be that my emotions are going crazy

38:16.836 --> 38:20.173
right now and you know, I just can't, but,

38:20.215 --> 38:26.805
like I just feel inside, it's like,

38:26.846 --> 38:30.100
it's a calming feeling, it's a good feeling.

38:38.399 --> 38:41.278
[Harley] I like to train in a place that's a bit rural.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.822
When you're done giving everything you can physically

38:43.863 --> 38:46.407
and mentally, as well, get in a car

38:46.449 --> 38:49.911
and you're driving through an area with beautiful foliage,

38:49.953 --> 38:52.038
there's something very cathartic about it.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.000
It's very quiet, and you can really spend time

38:55.041 --> 38:57.836
introspecting, and that's one of the hardest things

38:57.877 --> 39:00.379
in life to do is introspect.

39:00.421 --> 39:02.632
[breathing heavily]

39:08.346 --> 39:11.432
When I do well in the cage, I can extrapolate

39:11.474 --> 39:14.393
that experience into the courtroom,

39:14.435 --> 39:16.271
into other areas of my life.

39:16.313 --> 39:19.607
But I don't fear things the way that perhaps I did

39:19.649 --> 39:21.400
when I was younger.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.528
A judge is yelling at me, I just zone out,

39:23.569 --> 39:26.198
because there's nothing that person can do to hurt me.

39:26.239 --> 39:29.617
I've already faced the most terrifying event

39:29.659 --> 39:32.204
I could ever face in my mind, and that's getting

39:32.245 --> 39:34.372
on the mat or getting in the cage.

39:34.413 --> 39:36.166
And once I conquered that,

39:36.208 --> 39:38.918
conquering the courtroom was so easy.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.253
So easy.

39:45.675 --> 39:47.552
[bell rings]

40:02.692 --> 40:05.695
[woman] You do solemnly swear that

40:02.692 --> 40:05.695
the testimony about to be given

40:05.737 --> 40:07.155
in this case will be the truth,

40:07.197 --> 40:08.698
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

40:08.740 --> 40:10.200
-Yes, Your Honor. -Please state your name

40:10.242 --> 40:12.451
-for the record. -Detective John Scully.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.829
[Paul] How many shell casings were recovered?

40:14.871 --> 40:17.957
There was six shell casings.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.959
Four that were nine millimeters.

40:20.001 --> 40:22.087
One was a .380 caliber.

40:22.128 --> 40:25.464
-Item A, I didn't know. -You guys did anonymous?

40:25.506 --> 40:27.926
-It could have been, yes. -No further questions.

40:27.967 --> 40:31.512
-[Judge] Mr. Breite? -[Harley] Sir.

40:31.554 --> 40:34.432
Detective, with regard to the shell casings

40:34.473 --> 40:38.103
found at the scene, you were never able to connect

40:38.144 --> 40:43.149
those shell casings with any specific gun, were you?

40:44.567 --> 40:47.112
I don't know if a gun was ever recovered, sir.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.905
Thank you, nothing further.

40:48.947 --> 40:50.823
All right, any questions?

40:52.742 --> 40:54.493
I'm very confident, as I said--

40:54.535 --> 40:57.038
Listen, then you can strut like a peacock, brother,

40:57.080 --> 41:02.001
that you're confident, but the evidence that we have

41:02.043 --> 41:04.837
says that you were there, that's the problem.

41:04.879 --> 41:06.464
That's the problem.

41:06.505 --> 41:09.426
So, me, personally, I ain't rolling dice.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.469
I'm not letting people decide my fate

41:11.510 --> 41:15.014
and making their own opinions on what went down.

41:15.056 --> 41:18.101
That's not what I want. I want to be like,

41:15.056 --> 41:18.101
you know what?

41:18.143 --> 41:20.228
Let me get in front of this. This is what happened.

41:20.270 --> 41:22.480
I was fucking around and some little girl got killed

41:22.521 --> 41:24.065
by accident.

41:24.107 --> 41:25.733
There's a big difference.

41:25.775 --> 41:28.111
I'm not letting them fucking choose what I did.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.196
-I'm gonna-- -I didn't do nothing, though.

41:30.238 --> 41:31.823
I'm gonna talk for me.

41:31.864 --> 41:33.658
[woman] Please state your name for the record.

41:33.699 --> 41:36.244
-Jack DeSalvo. -You may proceed

41:33.699 --> 41:36.244
to the witness stand.

41:36.286 --> 41:39.580
-[Paul] Good morning, Detective. -Good morning.

41:39.622 --> 41:41.666
Detective, who are you employed by?

41:41.707 --> 41:43.209
-The city of Paterson. -Okay.

41:43.251 --> 41:44.752
Did you take statements in this case?

41:44.794 --> 41:46.296
Yes, I did.

41:46.338 --> 41:48.340
Was that statement, were statements taken

41:48.381 --> 41:50.008
by Detective Leishman and yourself?

41:50.049 --> 41:51.592
-Yes. -Were you involved

41:51.634 --> 41:54.346
in the statement of John E. Moore?

41:54.387 --> 41:56.764
-Yes, I was. -What was his answer

41:54.387 --> 41:56.764
when you said that

41:56.806 --> 41:58.557
you couldn't get over that last response

41:58.599 --> 42:00.559
that he wasn't there and wasn't involved?

42:00.601 --> 42:03.604
"I don't know why they would like put me at the scene,

42:03.646 --> 42:06.399
"want me to be at that scene, because I, like,

42:06.441 --> 42:09.402
"whatever cameras you say you got at the liquor store

42:09.444 --> 42:11.946
"or whatever, check 'em, and it will show you

42:11.988 --> 42:14.157
I was not put there."

42:14.199 --> 42:16.826
[Paul] Detective, during this investigation,

42:16.868 --> 42:18.953
were cameras attempted to be located?

42:18.995 --> 42:20.538
-Yes. -Were any working cameras

42:20.579 --> 42:21.664
found to be in that area?

42:21.706 --> 42:23.249
-No. -Were any cameras

42:23.291 --> 42:24.542
from businesses found to be in that area?

42:24.583 --> 42:27.379
-No. -Thank you.

42:27.420 --> 42:29.172
[Judge] Detective, you can step down.

42:29.214 --> 42:30.382
You're released for today.

42:30.423 --> 42:32.675
Rest and have a nice night.

42:42.143 --> 42:43.561
All right.

42:45.104 --> 42:49.859
[Harley] Detective, you went to a press conference

42:49.901 --> 42:53.571
to make a public announcement of the first arrest

42:53.612 --> 42:54.989
in this case, correct?

42:55.031 --> 42:57.950
-Yes. -And that first arrest

42:57.992 --> 43:01.162
pertained to my client, Jhymiere Moore, didn't it?

43:01.204 --> 43:04.040
-Yes. -Detective, you testified

43:04.082 --> 43:07.544
earlier about these shell casings that were found

43:07.585 --> 43:09.421
-on the scene, right? -Yes.

43:11.130 --> 43:15.801
It's a fact, isn't it, that you were never able

43:15.843 --> 43:19.389
to connect any of those casings with my client,

43:19.431 --> 43:21.182
Jhymiere Moore, correct?

43:21.224 --> 43:24.060
-Correct. -[Harley] Nothing further.

43:24.102 --> 43:25.395
All right, thanks.

43:30.400 --> 43:32.026
-Detective, good morning. -[Steven] Good morning.

43:32.068 --> 43:33.694
For the record, I'm Matthew Cavaliere,

43:33.736 --> 43:35.572
I'm representing Jeffry Ellerbee,

43:35.613 --> 43:37.407
and I have some questions.

43:37.449 --> 43:40.952
As lead investigator, are you the one who directs

43:40.993 --> 43:44.747
the CSI people to send bullets out for fingerprinting,

43:44.789 --> 43:46.874
for example?

43:46.916 --> 43:49.085
For stuff that goes to the lab, it would be

43:49.127 --> 43:51.129
my responsibility to have certain items

43:51.170 --> 43:52.797
requested to be examined, yes.

43:52.838 --> 43:56.134
[Matthew] Okay. Now, in this case, by analyzing

43:56.175 --> 43:58.677
the firing pin fingerprint on the back

43:58.719 --> 44:02.765
of the spent shell casings from the Genesis case,

44:02.807 --> 44:07.019
it shows that the same gun was used

44:07.061 --> 44:10.189
in the April 1st, 2014 case, correct?

44:10.231 --> 44:12.191
-Yes. -And as a Paterson

44:12.233 --> 44:16.028
Police Department case number for the shooting event

44:16.070 --> 44:19.365
that happened on April 1st, 2014,

44:19.407 --> 44:21.409
involving the same gun, right?

44:21.451 --> 44:23.911
-Yes. -Now, would it surprise you

44:23.953 --> 44:26.581
to know that the person arrested and charged

44:26.623 --> 44:29.417
by your department for using that gun,

44:29.459 --> 44:31.043
his first name is Eli?

44:31.085 --> 44:32.920
Are you familiar with that shooting case now?

44:32.962 --> 44:37.550
-Yes. -It turns out your department

44:37.592 --> 44:40.178
interviewed him in this case.

44:40.219 --> 44:41.846
-[Matthew] True? -[Steven] Yes.

44:41.887 --> 44:43.431
[Matthew] That was right after he got arrested

44:43.473 --> 44:46.225
-for the other shooting, true? -Yes.

44:46.267 --> 44:48.269
How long did that interview take?

44:48.311 --> 44:50.021
I was actually not part of that interview,

44:50.062 --> 44:51.939
that was two other detectives that spoke to him.

44:51.981 --> 44:53.483
[Matthew] Would it surprise you to know

44:53.525 --> 44:56.902
that the interview of Eli took six minutes?

44:56.944 --> 44:58.863
I don't know, I wasn't there.

45:00.406 --> 45:02.283
Would it surprise you to know that that interview

45:02.325 --> 45:06.204
did not ask him about the Genesis case

45:06.245 --> 45:09.706
other than to tell him that you had developed

45:09.748 --> 45:13.127
information indicating that he was there?

45:13.169 --> 45:14.504
You know that, right?

45:14.546 --> 45:15.963
-Yes. -It's in your report.

45:16.005 --> 45:18.257
-Yes. -The guy who used

45:18.299 --> 45:22.928
the same gun that was used to kill Genesis

45:22.970 --> 45:26.057
was there at the time of the shooting,

45:26.098 --> 45:28.059
and that's why you brought him in?

45:28.100 --> 45:31.103
-Yes. -You never asked him

45:28.100 --> 45:31.103
about the same gun, did you?

45:31.145 --> 45:34.190
-No. -No further questions.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.942
-Thank you. -[Judge] All right, thank you.

45:39.862 --> 45:42.865
[low chattering]

45:46.285 --> 45:50.039
[needle buzzing]

45:50.081 --> 45:52.208
[chattering]

45:52.250 --> 45:54.544
[Alexis] I was a Marshae,

45:54.586 --> 45:58.297
I was a Moore, I was an Ellerbee, I was.

45:59.215 --> 46:00.799
I was.

46:00.841 --> 46:03.010
I don't hate them.

46:04.803 --> 46:07.306
They're kids.

46:07.348 --> 46:08.933
They're kids. I was a kid, too.

46:08.974 --> 46:10.851
I was that kid.

46:10.893 --> 46:14.731
I was that kid that my family members would tell

46:14.771 --> 46:18.359
their kids, "Don't hang with Alexis."

46:18.401 --> 46:20.653
"Don't hang with Alexis.

46:20.695 --> 46:23.406
Alexis is bad news."

46:23.448 --> 46:26.158
I'm no different than these guys.

46:28.286 --> 46:31.956
It's just that I had the right people,

46:31.997 --> 46:33.916
-I had the right support. -[video game beeping]

46:33.958 --> 46:37.587
My parole officer, Mr. Williams,

46:37.629 --> 46:41.340
I violated at least twice,

46:41.382 --> 46:43.342
and he said that he was not gonna lock me up

46:43.384 --> 46:45.678
because I was a smart kid and he met my mom

46:45.720 --> 46:49.557
and he said, "Your parents are good parents.

46:49.599 --> 46:51.892
And they don't deserve that from you."

46:54.103 --> 46:57.022
I would like to be a counselor.

46:57.064 --> 47:00.318
Because if you can take one kid,

47:00.359 --> 47:03.862
whether it be a kid that was born on East 19

47:03.904 --> 47:07.450
in Paterson, named Alexis Rincon,

47:07.492 --> 47:10.911
people know him as Chooser, or Choose One,

47:10.953 --> 47:14.457
or that kid that lives on 10th Ave.

47:14.499 --> 47:17.084
that goes by the name of Marshae Anthony.

47:20.379 --> 47:23.591
Then you did something.

47:23.633 --> 47:25.802
[woman] Raise your right hand, please.

47:23.633 --> 47:25.802
You do solemnly swear

47:25.842 --> 47:27.762
or affirm that your testimony you're about to give

47:27.804 --> 47:29.263
in this case will be the truth,

47:29.305 --> 47:30.973
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

47:31.015 --> 47:32.684
-Yes. -Please state

47:31.015 --> 47:32.684
your name for the record.

47:32.725 --> 47:34.769
-Caurie Swinger. -You may proceed to the stand.

47:34.811 --> 47:37.814
[Judge] You may proceed over here

47:34.811 --> 47:37.814
to the witness stand.

47:56.290 --> 48:00.628
Mr. Swinger, do you recall being in the city of Paterson

48:00.670 --> 48:04.881
-on July 5th, 2014? -Yes.

48:04.923 --> 48:07.802
[Paul] Do you recall being arrested at a house

48:07.844 --> 48:09.804
in the city of Paterson on about that day?

48:09.846 --> 48:14.058
-Yes. -Ultimately, the charges

48:09.846 --> 48:14.058
you plead guilty to,

48:14.099 --> 48:17.144
-were they possession of CVS? -Yes.

48:17.186 --> 48:18.813
-Third degree? -Yes.

48:18.855 --> 48:21.148
-And animal cruelty fourth degree?

48:18.855 --> 48:21.148
-Yes.

48:21.190 --> 48:23.359
Did you receive probation for this charge?

48:23.401 --> 48:25.403
An agreement that you will be receiving probation?

48:25.444 --> 48:26.903
-Yeah. -Did it require you

48:26.945 --> 48:29.114
-to be here today to testify? -Yes.

48:39.500 --> 48:42.503
[Paul] On July 5th, 2014, is this the point of view

48:42.545 --> 48:44.672
-you would have had? -Yes.

48:44.714 --> 48:46.340
I'll ask you to point to where you were,

48:46.382 --> 48:48.300
using this picture.

48:48.342 --> 48:52.179
He's indicating the back porch of Photo 3.

48:52.221 --> 48:54.223
Did you notice a particular type of vehicle

48:54.265 --> 48:57.142
that traveled down that got your attention?

48:57.184 --> 48:59.896
-Yes. -And why did it

48:57.184 --> 48:59.896
get your attention?

48:59.936 --> 49:02.398
It was firing at it.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.275
[Paul] Okay. They was firing at it?

49:04.316 --> 49:05.984
-Yes. -Okay.

49:07.111 --> 49:09.196
And what type of vehicle was this?

49:09.238 --> 49:10.740
-White van. -[woman coughs]

49:10.782 --> 49:12.408
-[Paul] White van? -[Caurie] Yes.

49:12.450 --> 49:14.702
[Paul] How many people were firing at that van?

49:14.744 --> 49:16.495
-Two. -Okay.

49:16.537 --> 49:18.372
[Paul] Now do you see those people in court?

49:18.414 --> 49:20.458
-Yes, with the braids. -[Paul] Okay.

49:20.499 --> 49:22.460
[Judge] Identifying the defendant, Jhymiere Moore.

49:22.501 --> 49:25.504
[Paul] What about the next person, the other person--

49:25.546 --> 49:27.590
-Who was the other shooter? -Jeffry.

49:27.632 --> 49:29.383
[Paul] What's Jeffry wearing,

49:29.425 --> 49:31.427
or what does he look like today?

49:31.469 --> 49:33.137
[Caurie] With the short haircut.

49:33.178 --> 49:35.640
-What about the color of shirt? -[Caurie] Blue.

49:35.681 --> 49:37.850
[Judge] Identifying the defendant, Jeffry Ellerbee.

49:39.101 --> 49:40.853
[Paul] Can you describe what you saw?

49:40.895 --> 49:43.021
One of them went in the street and started firing.

49:43.063 --> 49:44.607
[Harley] I'm sorry, I can't hear him.

49:44.649 --> 49:46.108
[Judge] One of them went in the street

49:46.150 --> 49:48.152
-and started firing? -Yes.

49:48.193 --> 49:50.028
[Judge] You said three of them

49:48.193 --> 49:50.028
went in the streets?

49:50.070 --> 49:52.907
No, no. I said they went in the middle of the street

49:52.949 --> 49:54.408
-and started firing. -[Judge] They went in the middle

49:54.450 --> 49:56.160
of the street and started firing, okay.

49:56.201 --> 49:59.622
[Paul] You said Mr. Warrant Ellerbee was standing,

49:59.664 --> 50:04.042
hand guns are passed off at that point.

50:04.084 --> 50:05.670
The white van, did you see the white van?

50:05.711 --> 50:08.673
-Yes. -Where's

50:05.711 --> 50:08.673
the white van traveling?

50:08.714 --> 50:10.382
[Caurie] Down Rosa Parks towards King.

50:10.424 --> 50:12.927
[Paul] You said that Ellerbee and Moore,

50:12.969 --> 50:15.847
-you said they had the guns? -Yes.

50:15.888 --> 50:17.139
What were they doing with the guns?

50:17.181 --> 50:18.724
[Caurie] Firing them.

50:18.766 --> 50:20.225
[Paul] And you said they were in the street?

50:20.267 --> 50:22.186
-Yes. -The van was in front of 'em?

50:22.227 --> 50:23.771
-Yes. -The van was moving?

50:23.813 --> 50:25.690
Yes.

50:25.731 --> 50:27.733
[Paul] What was it they were running?

50:27.775 --> 50:30.110
[Caurie] Running towards the van shooting.

50:30.152 --> 50:31.696
Running towards the van shooting.

50:31.737 --> 50:33.865
[Paul] "Running towards the van shooting."

50:33.906 --> 50:37.326
Do you remember describing them to the police?

50:37.368 --> 50:39.328
[Judge] Sir, I'm going to interrupt you for a second.

50:39.370 --> 50:42.247
There's an issue I have to deal with.

50:42.289 --> 50:46.627
We're going to take, there will be a very short break,

50:46.669 --> 50:49.672
I have to address an issue that's come up.

50:49.714 --> 50:51.298
[Judge] Do me a favor, put the phone

50:51.340 --> 50:53.843
on top of the stand, please, all right?

50:53.885 --> 50:56.971
All right. Can Council approach, please?

50:57.013 --> 50:58.639
Just leave the phone there. Why don't you just

50:58.681 --> 51:00.599
step outside, please?

51:00.641 --> 51:03.394
Just leave the phone, leave the phone.

51:03.435 --> 51:05.521
[people chattering]

51:12.361 --> 51:14.363
[Judge] Someone is texting on the phone,

51:14.405 --> 51:18.116
and I asked the witness now, and apparently it's him.

51:18.158 --> 51:20.870
[Harley] Earlier in the trial, there was evidence

51:20.912 --> 51:22.621
that came out that the gun used

51:22.663 --> 51:25.332
to kill Genesis Rincon was used,

51:25.374 --> 51:27.251
three months earlier to her killing,

51:27.292 --> 51:28.753
in a shooting incident.

51:28.794 --> 51:33.966
The person who used that gun was caught.

51:34.008 --> 51:36.343
His name is Eli Hanes.

51:36.385 --> 51:39.889
Today, the state's star witness, it's discovered

51:39.931 --> 51:42.140
that he's texting while on the stand.

51:42.182 --> 51:44.852
He texted someone saying, "Eli is here."

51:44.894 --> 51:47.813
And the response came back, "What's Eli doing there?"

51:47.855 --> 51:51.984
Which leads us to conclude only one thing.

51:53.694 --> 52:00.576
Calvary Swinger testified today under the pressure

52:00.618 --> 52:03.412
of pointing the finger at my client

52:03.454 --> 52:09.585
because he knows that Eli Hanes is the true killer.

52:11.587 --> 52:13.714
[Judge] We're going to recess at this time.

52:13.756 --> 52:17.802
[Harley] Today, I would say we received what I like to call

52:17.843 --> 52:19.887
a nugget, a golden nugget.

52:19.929 --> 52:22.098
If I'm successful in using

52:22.138 --> 52:24.600
and implementing that nugget,

52:24.642 --> 52:26.685
then I'm hopeful that the jury will use

52:26.727 --> 52:29.229
that bit of information in my favor--

52:29.271 --> 52:30.982
in my client's favor--

52:31.023 --> 52:33.776
when they deliberate as to whether or not my client

52:33.818 --> 52:35.527
committed this crime.

52:35.569 --> 52:37.237
[people chattering]

52:37.279 --> 52:39.657
[Harley] All right, how we doing tonight, all right?

52:39.698 --> 52:41.617
-[light cheering] -[woman] All right!

52:41.659 --> 52:43.494
All right, I want to thank everybody for coming

52:43.535 --> 52:45.830
to our annual St. Paddy's Day party.

52:45.871 --> 52:49.000
[Harley] I have a charity, it's called Harley's Kids.

52:49.041 --> 52:52.795
And, I guess, for the last 25 years,

52:52.837 --> 52:55.089
I started with 32 mentally

52:55.131 --> 52:57.257
and physically challenged children,

52:57.299 --> 52:59.510
and right now, I've built it up,

52:59.551 --> 53:02.346
with the help of other people, of course, to 200.

53:02.387 --> 53:03.889
So I have 200 kids,

53:03.931 --> 53:06.684
and I have parties

53:06.725 --> 53:08.019
every two, three months.

53:08.060 --> 53:10.186
We make an occasion.

53:10.228 --> 53:12.230
We have a St. Paddy's Day party.

53:12.272 --> 53:14.859
We have a Halloween party, a Christmas party.

53:14.900 --> 53:16.527
Things like that.

53:16.568 --> 53:18.445
We come up with an excuse to have parties.

53:21.699 --> 53:24.242
Yeah, usually I take two at a time bowling.

53:24.284 --> 53:27.705
Let me show you amateurs how it's done.

53:27.746 --> 53:29.331
I'm just saying, if you miss this,

53:29.373 --> 53:32.292
you might lose the whole game. No pressure.

53:32.334 --> 53:34.461
[Harley] I usually take Scott Donkersleugh.

53:34.503 --> 53:36.964
I've known Scott at least 25 years.

53:40.092 --> 53:43.679
And we usually bring Joey.

53:43.721 --> 53:45.723
He's got severe down syndrome.

53:45.764 --> 53:47.975
In fact, you can't understand what he says.

53:48.017 --> 53:49.225
Nobody can.

53:50.686 --> 53:52.437
[Harley] Oh no, come on.

53:57.151 --> 53:58.694
[Harley] Those kids bring me several things.

53:58.736 --> 54:01.113
One, they remind me I'm blessed.

54:01.155 --> 54:02.698
So it calms me.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.783
I realize that as bad a day as I'm having,

54:04.825 --> 54:06.660
I'm still blessed.

54:06.702 --> 54:09.413
Two, it reminds me that there are some people out there

54:09.454 --> 54:11.289
who like me for me.

54:11.331 --> 54:13.625
They just like me, Harley, the guy.

54:13.667 --> 54:17.129
They remind me that there's so much goodness out there,

54:17.171 --> 54:21.050
despite the disadvantages and the tragedies.

54:21.092 --> 54:24.053
The injustice of the universe is far more

54:24.095 --> 54:26.847
than the injustice of any court system.

54:26.889 --> 54:30.517
[ethereal theme playing]

54:43.697 --> 54:45.783
[people chattering]

55:08.139 --> 55:10.724
[indistinct conversation]

55:10.766 --> 55:13.269
[Judge] Mr. Breite, closing arguments.

55:22.694 --> 55:25.656
Now, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by saying

55:25.697 --> 55:29.868
that in a criminal trial, sometimes there's a moment.

55:29.910 --> 55:32.746
Not only has every piece of evidence presented

55:32.788 --> 55:35.249
by the prosecution been discredited

55:35.291 --> 55:36.959
or rendered meaningless,

55:37.001 --> 55:39.544
we have also shown that there is

55:39.586 --> 55:42.798
a far more believable suspect in this killing

55:42.840 --> 55:45.259
who is not on trial here.

55:46.510 --> 55:47.803
We know who that is.

55:47.845 --> 55:50.055
That's Eli Hunt.

55:50.097 --> 55:55.393
He used the gun that killed Genesis three months earlier,

55:55.435 --> 55:57.896
and then showed up here in court to make sure that

55:57.938 --> 56:02.651
Calvary Swinger went through with his false testimony.

56:02.693 --> 56:04.778
Ladies and gentlemen, a trial is a search

56:04.820 --> 56:06.613
for the truth, that's why we're here.

56:06.655 --> 56:08.615
We want to know what really happened that night.

56:08.657 --> 56:10.868
And we don't. There was lazy

56:10.909 --> 56:13.120
and poor detective work.

56:13.162 --> 56:16.957
What might it cost to run a fingerprint analysis

56:16.999 --> 56:18.334
on the casings?

56:20.169 --> 56:22.296
Who cares what it cost?

56:22.338 --> 56:25.090
Justice doesn't have a price.

56:25.132 --> 56:28.135
The life of that 12-year-old girl is not equated

56:28.177 --> 56:31.680
with a price for running a simple fingerprint test.

56:31.722 --> 56:34.058
You shouldn't tolerate an investigation

56:34.099 --> 56:37.811
that fell short, whether it's due to incompetency

56:37.853 --> 56:39.146
or laziness.

56:40.605 --> 56:42.274
And I would ask you ladies and gentlemen,

56:42.316 --> 56:44.776
when you go back into that jury room,

56:44.818 --> 56:49.240
to ask yourself, is there a reasonable possibility

56:49.281 --> 56:51.116
that Swinger and Carter

56:51.158 --> 56:54.078
simply lied to protect themselves

56:54.119 --> 56:56.121
and gain an advantage

56:56.163 --> 56:58.374
with the extremely serious crimes

56:58.414 --> 57:00.542
they were each facing?

57:00.584 --> 57:02.711
If there's a reasonable possibility

57:02.753 --> 57:06.090
that they were lying, then there's reasonable doubt,

57:06.131 --> 57:10.219
and the verdict must be, must be not guilty.

57:11.720 --> 57:14.139
-Thank you. -[Judge] Thank you, Mr. Breite.

57:15.515 --> 57:18.143
All right, Mr. Prosecutor, closing statements.

57:24.566 --> 57:26.235
[Paul] Ladies and gentlemen, this case

57:26.277 --> 57:29.905
comes down to Calvary Swinger and Keyshawn Parton.

57:29.947 --> 57:36.453
Their statements, I submit, are truthful, reliable,

57:36.494 --> 57:39.206
and credible based on other things that we have shown.

57:39.248 --> 57:40.999
We talk about deals given,

57:41.041 --> 57:45.170
deals taken, the dogs, the drugs.

57:45.212 --> 57:46.964
That deal had to be done.

57:47.005 --> 57:49.591
And unfortunately, in Paterson,

57:49.633 --> 57:52.719
in that area where the homicide happened,

57:52.761 --> 57:54.512
these are the witnesses you get.

57:54.554 --> 57:56.681
These are the witnesses that you have.

57:56.723 --> 57:58.516
They are people from the street,

57:58.558 --> 58:01.519
they live out there, they try to raise families out there.

58:01.561 --> 58:04.315
They deal drugs out there.

58:04.356 --> 58:08.152
And they shoot weapons.

58:08.193 --> 58:10.862
And you know why Eli's here?

58:14.116 --> 58:16.743
Because these guys ended up getting that weapon,

58:16.785 --> 58:18.829
getting that first weapon, community handgun,

58:18.870 --> 58:20.580
a shared handgun.

58:20.622 --> 58:24.168
Eli Hines was never arrested with a handgun.

58:24.209 --> 58:27.212
He never had a handgun that was taken off his possession

58:27.254 --> 58:28.964
because he got rid of it.

58:29.006 --> 58:31.383
You don't throw a perfectly good handgun in the river.

58:31.425 --> 58:33.927
You sell it, you give it away. That's the game.

58:33.969 --> 58:35.471
Don't get caught with it twice.

58:36.847 --> 58:39.057
I want to thank you for your paying attention.

58:39.099 --> 58:40.684
Once again, I think, beyond a reasonable doubt,

58:40.725 --> 58:42.644
the state has proven its case and I ask you

58:42.686 --> 58:45.689
to return a verdict on each and every one of those charges

58:45.730 --> 58:47.941
in the affirmative, guilty.

58:47.983 --> 58:49.943
-Thank you. -Thank you, Mr. DeGroot.

58:49.985 --> 58:52.154
[Judge] All right, ladies and gentlemen,

58:52.196 --> 58:54.698
we come to the end of the day,

58:54.739 --> 58:57.368
the only thing left for me to do is to charge you,

58:57.409 --> 58:58.743
that's gonna take about an hour.

58:58.785 --> 59:00.245
So what I'm going to do now is,

59:00.287 --> 59:01.955
I'm going to recess for the day.

59:01.997 --> 59:04.708
[people chattering]

59:07.044 --> 59:11.173
[melancholy theme playing]

59:59.846 --> 01:00:02.224
How are the other kids doing?

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:05.310
-Taken? -My kids are horrible.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:10.148
Because I guess it's hard because they know

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.443
the type of person that Jeffry is,

01:00:12.484 --> 01:00:16.488
and as far for them to explain to them

01:00:16.530 --> 01:00:18.031
what actually happened...

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:19.491
I mean, they talk to Jeffry every day,

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.368
but it's not the same.

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:23.954
They're used to Jeffry being at the basketball games

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:26.873
and they're really close.

01:00:26.915 --> 01:00:29.000
He would never do that.

01:00:31.086 --> 01:00:33.338
But I'm hoping, I'm praying.

01:00:34.672 --> 01:00:36.550
That's why, I guess, right now,

01:00:36.592 --> 01:00:39.177
that's all we have, is because like,

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:45.225
like I said, sometimes, we're forgotten in the background.

01:00:45.267 --> 01:00:49.480
I mean, they're going through their whole new issues

01:00:49.521 --> 01:00:51.523
and back and forth and everything,

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:54.234
but nobody really takes that consideration

01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:55.944
and says, "You know what?

01:00:55.986 --> 01:00:59.114
"We need to come to something, the parents can't keep

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:02.576
"going through, the parents can't keep losing work,

01:01:02.618 --> 01:01:04.286
they can't keep," you know?

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:06.830
I told my mother, I said, because I said

01:01:06.871 --> 01:01:09.500
I look to her every day, I see your pain every day,

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:11.460
and I told my mother, I said I had to say something

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:15.172
because I really do feel bad, I really do.

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:17.090
We as parents, our kids really don't know

01:01:17.132 --> 01:01:20.552
what we do for them, they don't know what headaches

01:01:20.594 --> 01:01:24.640
we have in our heads and how we try to give them

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.267
the best, even that,

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:31.188
even if we can't give the best, we go there.

01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:34.525
Because this was a shock to me, and I told Jeffry,

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:36.860
"If you have to go to jail for this,

01:01:36.901 --> 01:01:38.903
you just have to deal with the consequences."

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:43.741
I mean, at the end of the day, I said, "I'm still gonna

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:47.329
be your mother, at the end of the day, I'm still..."

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:48.955
Gonna be there for you.

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:50.666
Yeah, but I said, "At the end of the day,

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:53.544
"they lost their daughter, so you just have to have

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:55.753
some kind of compassion for that."

01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:58.965
Yeah.

01:02:00.592 --> 01:02:02.553
He said he understands.

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:09.976
I don't hate them, 'cause I don't.

01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:11.436
I'm just mad.

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:13.647
[melancholy theme playing]

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:21.112
[crying]

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:26.159
[sobbing]

01:02:33.709 --> 01:02:38.380
[Janny] Whether they go to jail or not,

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:40.507
I can't see her, I can't talk to her,

01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:43.885
I can't hug her, I can't hear her calling me Mommy anymore.

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.011
Because it's never gonna happen.

01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:46.971
I like chicken.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.473
[Janny] When Genesis passed away,

01:02:48.515 --> 01:02:51.017
-they took half of her. -[laughter]

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:53.811
I have never seen a bond like that with two sisters.

01:02:53.853 --> 01:02:56.356
Chillin' with Grandma.

01:02:56.398 --> 01:02:57.608
Do I look like your grandmother?

01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:59.192
[laughter]

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:00.985
[Genesis] You look old.

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:03.363
-Your momma. -Your momma.

01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:05.282
-I'm telling Mom. -[Golda] No!

01:03:05.323 --> 01:03:07.951
-Mom, Golda said you're old! -[Golda] No, I didn't.

01:03:07.992 --> 01:03:10.245
[bailiff] If anyone pulls out their cell phones,

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:13.206
they will be confiscated and they will be kicked out.

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:14.999
[people chattering]

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.825
[bailiff] Remain seated.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:58.752
So we have 12 jurors seated.

01:03:58.794 --> 01:04:03.131
The jury, I reviewed your note and I think your message

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:04.508
to the court has been clear.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:07.344
I just want to ask the foreperson,

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:09.053
I want to ask you a question.

01:04:09.095 --> 01:04:11.431
Foreperson, do you feel that further deliberations

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:13.933
would be beneficial, do you feel you've reached a point

01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:15.644
in which further deliberations

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:17.688
-would be futile? -[woman] I do.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:20.732
-You feel that they would be futile?

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:20.732
-Yeah.

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:23.193
[Judge] Considering all of that,

01:04:23.234 --> 01:04:24.695
I find the determination

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:26.613
of this trial is necessary because the jury

01:04:26.655 --> 01:04:28.865
has failed to agree upon a verdict

01:04:28.906 --> 01:04:31.660
within a reasonable time,

01:04:31.702 --> 01:04:34.496
after reasonable time for a deliberation has been allowed.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:36.623
I'm going to declare a mistrial.

01:04:36.665 --> 01:04:38.542
[people murmuring]

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:42.920
[Judge] Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the function

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:44.964
you have performed is one of the most important

01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:49.093
civic duties which you will ever be called upon to fulfill.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:51.929
With the declaration of a mistrial in this matter,

01:04:51.971 --> 01:04:54.015
your service is now complete.

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:57.644
On a personal note, every day I see how citizens

01:04:57.686 --> 01:04:59.855
such as you respond to the responsibility,

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:02.440
the decision making that is jury service.

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:05.569
It is truly remarkable witnessing that reality.

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.738
And I say that even though you didn't reach a verdict.

01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:09.698
I know how hard you worked at this case.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.617
We've been at this case for over two months.

01:05:12.659 --> 01:05:14.536
So with that, I now discharge you with

01:05:14.578 --> 01:05:17.414
the sincerest of thanks of all of us

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:20.250
who serve in our court system, you're now free to go.

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:22.711
I wish everybody the best.

01:05:45.149 --> 01:05:46.860
[people chattering]

01:05:46.902 --> 01:05:49.153
A hung jury, it's like, it's a non-decision.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.531
It's not a decision.

01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:53.366
So the charges are still there.

01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.159
Now, in theory, we could...

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:57.621
These boys still got to sit in jail.

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:05.462
While we are elated at the result of a mistrial,

01:06:05.503 --> 01:06:10.049
it in no way diminishes the tragedy that the family

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:12.051
of the victim still has to endure.

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:19.267
Immediately after Jhymiere was arrested,

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:23.146
and incarcerated for the murder of Genesis Rincon,

01:06:23.187 --> 01:06:26.775
he was then also charged with another murder case,

01:06:26.817 --> 01:06:30.027
and that entire case, the police investigated

01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:32.614
my client, believed he had nothing to do with it,

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:35.283
and left him out of it, and now, lo and behold,

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:38.286
they indict him on that murder case.

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:40.664
Very, very curious circumstances.

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:43.374
-Processing what's going on? -Yes, ma'am.

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:45.209
[man] Do you know how long you'll be going away for?

01:06:45.251 --> 01:06:47.671
[Harley] So he'd have to win two trials in order

01:06:47.712 --> 01:06:49.547
to walk away scot free.

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:52.049
Trials are risky businesses.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.302
And anything can happen at a trial,

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:57.305
and even though he felt empowered in one sense

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:00.016
by the hung jury, he was smart enough to know

01:07:00.057 --> 01:07:02.059
that it's not a guarantee next time.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:04.354
In the end,

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.314
we were able to come to a deal,

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:10.360
in which Jhymiere pled to 20 years.

01:07:10.401 --> 01:07:13.154
He would have to serve 85% of that time,

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:16.574
so 17 years, before he can apply for parole.

01:07:16.616 --> 01:07:17.993
He's been in for three,

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.786
so he gets credit for all of that.

01:07:19.828 --> 01:07:22.079
So he'll be out in 14 years.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:23.957
He'll be 36 years old.

01:07:23.999 --> 01:07:26.626
He can resume his life with his, right now he has

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:30.129
a three year old son, he can marry, he can go to college,

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:33.925
he can have a life, and he ultimately decided that

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:36.803
pleading to being responsible for the death

01:07:36.845 --> 01:07:40.974
of Genesis Rincon and Raji Clark was in his best interest.

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:46.563
He went in an open forum, took an oath to tell

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:49.106
the truth and said, "I shot the bullet

01:07:49.148 --> 01:07:52.068
that killed that girl."

01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:55.030
Somewhere, the truth exists.
