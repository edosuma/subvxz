Jupiter mission.

03:43.891 --> 03:44.990

03:58.906 --> 04:02.374
Because it'll be too far away
for real time communication,

we need a robot that can

Why ex?
She couldn't keep up.

05:19.887 --> 05:20.952
I had to let her go.

Didn't I hear that she quit?

05:22.556 --> 05:24.389
Trust me.
She was pushed.

05:24.391 --> 05:26.158
Maybe she holds a grudge.

Girls are big on grudges.

where we can find Vivian?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.400
Last I heard,
she was spending all her time

05:35.402 --> 05:37.202
at the Robot Rumble.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.970
What is a Robot Rumble?

05:38.972 --> 05:41.039
The Robot Rumble
is a community:

05:41.041 --> 05:43.975
a gathering where enthusiasts
exchange information

05:43.977 --> 05:46.845
and test their robot's
competitive capabilities.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.414
It's for members only.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.316
KIM: So a bunch of tech
geeks get together

05:51.318 --> 05:53.285
to watch robots fight.

05:53.287 --> 05:55.854
It's glorious.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.989
Hot diggety!

Tread lightly with Vivian.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.067
Her boyfriend Oliver
founded the Rumble.

Lucky you.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.482
So not... I don't happen to have
a robot with me.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.984
That's where you're wrong.

08:11.757 --> 08:14.759
I asked you not to
embarrass me, cuz.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.262
I'm going to be banned
from the club for life.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.231
Larry, you're forgetting
that your cousin

08:19.233 --> 08:21.099
is <i>th</i> Kim Possible.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.601
We could run right now.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.369
If we want to find
Phen's robot,

08:24.371 --> 08:26.738
we have to stay and rumble.

08:30.009 --> 08:31.276
Run.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.244
Rumble.

08:32.246 --> 08:34.246

Come on, Wade.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.345

It's not responding!

09:29.101 --> 09:31.236
Your robot thinks for itself.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.404
Where'd you get it?

09:32.406 --> 09:33.471
Not at the Space Center,

09:33.473 --> 09:34.773
if that's what
you're insinuating,

09:34.775 --> 09:35.807
Miss Possible.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.742
You're calling Vivian a thief?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.312

10:03.370 --> 10:04.869
Hey!

10:04.871 --> 10:08.340
Gee, Ron, maybe it's 'cause
there are no rules!

10:09.875 --> 10:11.376
Hi.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.179
One for <i>Teen Town Trauma...</i>

10:14.181 --> 10:15.313
Annie.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.115
My name's not Annie.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.517
They don't have
my tag ready yet.

10:19.519 --> 10:20.752
Enjoy the show.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.253
Hey!

10:24.357 --> 10:26.591
( <i>chattering</i> )

10:26.593 --> 10:27.592
You're right, bud.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.593
I can do this.

10:28.595 --> 10:30.161
There are no rules to stop me.

10:31.564 --> 10:32.897
Changed my mind.

10:32.899 --> 10:35.133
Thought I'd catch
<i>Meetin' Cute</i> instead.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.534
By the way, what <i>is</i> your name?

10:36.536 --> 10:37.736
Zeta.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.537
Enjoy the show.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.206
Ah!

10:44.710 --> 10:45.910
Zeta.

10:45.912 --> 10:46.911
It's a nice name.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.214
You going to buy
a ticket or what?

10:49.216 --> 10:51.483
<i>My Little Puppy 2:</i>
<i>Puppy's Pride.</i>

10:51.485 --> 10:54.753
Have you bought a ticket
for, like, every movie?

10:54.755 --> 10:55.854
Kinda.

10:55.856 --> 10:57.255
Enjoy the show.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.828
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm...

11:03.830 --> 11:04.863
It's no use, Rufus.

11:04.865 --> 11:07.365
Kim's wrong... the rules rule.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.900
( <i>growls</i>)

11:08.902 --> 11:10.168
Look, you seem really nice

11:10.170 --> 11:11.403
and I know that I'm just
a guy like me,

11:11.405 --> 11:12.904
but I can be okay
and it would be really cool

11:12.906 --> 11:14.439
if I could get to know you
better and maybe...

11:14.441 --> 11:18.443
( <i>no audio</i> )

11:18.445 --> 11:19.744
( <i>beeps</i> )

11:19.746 --> 11:22.380
Sorry, mic wasn't on.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.416
( <i>whimpering</i>)

11:28.621 --> 11:30.355
What news, Kim?

11:30.357 --> 11:33.324
Go ahead. I just have
a few adjustments to make.

11:34.627 --> 11:35.627
His name's Oliver.

11:35.629 --> 11:36.861
He was with Vivian

11:36.863 --> 11:38.463
at the Robot Rumble.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.266
I've never seen <i>him</i> before,

11:41.268 --> 11:43.468
but that's my robot.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.469
They stole it.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.371
( <i>bleeps</i> ) Go, Wade.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.340
Kim, I checked
every robotics lab database.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.376
No history on this Oliver guy.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.578
It's like he came
out of thin air.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.879
Thanks.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.981
Please, get my robot back, Kim.

11:56.983 --> 11:59.484
We're running
out of time... ( <i>yells</i> )

12:01.520 --> 12:02.887
I'm okay.

12:04.590 --> 12:05.590
Oh! Sorry.

12:05.592 --> 12:06.558
Oh, I'm so sorry.

12:06.560 --> 12:07.459
My-my bad. Sorry.

12:07.461 --> 12:08.727
No, it's...

12:08.729 --> 12:10.462
I thought I'd never
see you again.

12:10.464 --> 12:11.730
Same here.

12:11.732 --> 12:14.866
And now I spilled my
decaf-olay all over you.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.768
Decaf-olay? That's
what I'm drinking.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.369
RON:
This doesn't happen.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.239
I feel like I've
know you all my life.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.675
That's exactly what
I was going to say.

12:23.677 --> 12:24.676
( <i>growls</i> )

12:24.678 --> 12:26.444
( <i>munching</i> )

12:26.446 --> 12:30.548
Aw... Aw...

12:30.550 --> 12:32.283
I can't take my eyes off you.

12:32.285 --> 12:34.385
You'll never have to.

12:36.288 --> 12:37.288
Ron.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.490
Wade?

12:38.492 --> 12:40.325
Hey! Get off
the screen!

12:40.327 --> 12:42.427
We want to see the movie!

12:42.429 --> 12:44.395
Oh, come on, life
isn't anything like that.

12:44.397 --> 12:45.797
What do you know about life?!

12:45.799 --> 12:48.333
Ron, Kim is waiting for you
outside the theater.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.634
She is?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.836
That is so sweet.

12:51.838 --> 12:52.904
WADE:
She needs you.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.305
Aw...
Aw...

12:54.940 --> 12:55.740
Hurry, dude.

12:55.742 --> 12:58.309
Kim's waiting for you!

12:58.311 --> 13:00.044
( <i>cheering</i> )

13:02.348 --> 13:04.883
What did you do,
buy a ticket to every movie?

13:04.885 --> 13:07.552
No. That would be stupid.

13:08.587 --> 13:09.721
So, what's the urgency?

13:09.723 --> 13:11.389
Got to go back
to the robot club.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.458
There's not going
to be anybody there now.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.759
( <i>gibberish</i> )

13:17.329 --> 13:18.296
What are you doing?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.464
She almost saw us.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.498
Who?
Zeta.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.599
So?

13:21.601 --> 13:22.834
( <i>sighs</i> )

13:22.836 --> 13:24.636
See it through her eyes, Kim.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.971
You, me, boy, girl.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.506
Yeah, so?

13:28.508 --> 13:32.010
Seemingly coming out of
a date movie, together.

13:32.012 --> 13:35.613
You and me... on a date?

13:35.615 --> 13:36.781
It could happen.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.884
I mean, you know,
not that we would,

13:39.886 --> 13:41.853
you know, but if
someone didn't know

13:41.855 --> 13:43.488
that we were just best friends

13:43.490 --> 13:44.823
and they saw us together

13:44.825 --> 13:46.691
at the feel-good
film of the year,

13:46.693 --> 13:48.493
conclusions may be drawn.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.494
Yeah, uh-huh. Ron,

13:49.496 --> 13:50.528
I'm gonna say something

13:50.530 --> 13:51.763
I've never said to you before.

13:51.765 --> 13:52.797
What?

13:52.799 --> 13:54.399
You're thinking too much.

13:56.335 --> 13:57.635
Ooh!

13:57.637 --> 13:58.636
( <i>nervous giggling</i> )

13:58.638 --> 14:01.406
Come on,
Casa-no-duh.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.607
Unless...

14:02.609 --> 14:04.442
If Zeta saw us together,

14:04.444 --> 14:06.344
it would make me
unavailable, unobtainable,

14:06.346 --> 14:07.912
thus desirable.

14:07.914 --> 14:09.814
Thinking too much.

14:09.816 --> 14:12.083
It's all
in the rules, K.P.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.051
Look it up.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.118
( <i>yelps</i> )

14:17.857 --> 14:19.824
Wade, we're at the robot club.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.993
The door's got
a major alarm lock.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.394
Look in your pack.

14:26.098 --> 14:27.498
Acid to melt the lock?

14:27.500 --> 14:28.600
Chapped lips.

14:28.602 --> 14:31.102
( <i>smacks lips</i>)

14:31.104 --> 14:33.104
You want me to comb it open?

14:33.106 --> 14:34.772
Press the handle to activate.

14:34.774 --> 14:38.576
The latest in fiber-optic
security-breaching technology.

14:38.578 --> 14:41.579
It can penetrate
any alarm configuration.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.047
( <i>beeping</i> )

14:43.049 --> 14:45.583
( <i>clicking</i> )

14:45.585 --> 14:46.851
( <i>dings</i> )

14:48.487 --> 14:49.454
Sweet.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.660
Be careful.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.462
There might be...

14:57.464 --> 14:58.529
( <i>alarm blaring</i> )

14:58.531 --> 14:59.597
traps.

15:03.135 --> 15:04.769
Robot attack!

15:09.174 --> 15:11.075
( <i>yelling</i> )

15:12.011 --> 15:14.145
( <i>sighs</i> )

15:14.147 --> 15:15.513
Heh.

15:16.048 --> 15:16.915
( <i>buzzing</i> )

15:16.917 --> 15:17.882
COMPUTER:
Begin.

15:17.884 --> 15:18.950
( <i>screams</i>)

Attack! Attack!

15:20.053 --> 15:21.152
( <i>shrieks</i> )

15:21.154 --> 15:24.589
( <i>gibbering</i> )

15:28.694 --> 15:30.762
Come on. I've got it.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.671
ROBOT:
Attack! Attack!

15:46.211 --> 15:47.178
Faster!

15:52.718 --> 15:54.152
I think we lost him.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.721
Surprise attack!

15:56.723 --> 15:57.722
( <i>gasps</i> )

15:57.724 --> 15:59.223
( <i>shrieks</i> )

16:04.463 --> 16:06.030
Hey.

16:06.032 --> 16:07.065
Attack!

16:13.639 --> 16:14.839
Wade!

16:16.475 --> 16:17.642
( <i>gasps</i>)

16:21.547 --> 16:23.147
Got it, K.P.!

16:23.149 --> 16:24.115
( <i>gasps</i> )

16:24.117 --> 16:25.216
( <i>yells</i> )

16:25.218 --> 16:26.718
Oh, Ron.

This is getting so old.

( <i>train horn blaring</i> )

16:39.932 --> 16:41.132
( <i>screams</i> ):

( <i>horn blaring</i>)

16:46.172 --> 16:47.705
( <i>gasps</i> )

16:50.109 --> 16:51.676
Retreat! Retreat!

16:51.678 --> 16:54.846
( <i>grunting</i> )

16:54.848 --> 16:59.183
( <i>train horn blaring</i> )

17:01.720 --> 17:04.055
Self-preservation
programming.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.289
How did you...?

17:05.291 --> 17:07.692
Well, I analyzed the
situation carefully and I...

17:07.694 --> 17:09.027
Hey!

17:09.029 --> 17:10.628
Wade figured it out.

17:10.630 --> 17:13.064
Come on, let's get this
back to Phen.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.900
Good work, Kimmie.

17:15.902 --> 17:18.136
Thanks to you, the Jupiter
project is back on track.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.838
Hmm? Oh, yeah. Great.

17:20.840 --> 17:21.973
What's bothering you, hon?

17:21.975 --> 17:23.141
Nothing.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.142
It's just that...

17:24.144 --> 17:25.109
JIM:
Stop, come back!

17:25.111 --> 17:26.611
What is this?

17:26.613 --> 17:27.879
We built it, Dad.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.580
To take to the Robot Rumble.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.015
Watch this.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.854
Well, you're not
going to any rumble...

17:36.856 --> 17:38.022
without me.

17:38.024 --> 17:40.091
Nice craftsmanship, boys.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.627
What?

17:44.229 --> 17:45.296
( <i>gasps</i> )

17:49.334 --> 17:50.701
( <i>growling</i> )

17:50.703 --> 17:53.304
Keep it away from
me, you tweebs.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.173
It responds to movement.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.274
So, don't move.

17:59.144 --> 18:02.780
Right. Look at the way it
got that fast moving chair.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.115
Hmm. Weird.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.083
( <i>yells</i>)

18:05.085 --> 18:06.717
Turn it off!

18:06.719 --> 18:07.819
It won't go off.

18:07.821 --> 18:09.620
It's unstoppable.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.721
Cool.
Cool.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.925
( <i>both yelling</i>)

18:13.927 --> 18:16.794
Honestly, you boys are
no better with robots than Phen.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.763
( <i>gasps</i> ):
What did you say?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.798
Well, I don't mean
to talk out of school,

18:20.800 --> 18:22.300
but the man's utterly clueless.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.669
Sometimes I wonder how he
can be such an expert.

18:24.671 --> 18:25.670
That's it, Dad!

18:25.672 --> 18:26.838
( <i>beeping</i> )

18:26.840 --> 18:27.939
Go, Wade.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.874
Kim, I did that search
you asked for

18:29.876 --> 18:31.809
on Phen's
scholarly publications.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.044
But there are none.

18:33.046 --> 18:34.645
Right. None.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.081
All the recent
robotic articles are by...

18:37.083 --> 18:38.716
Dr. V.F. Porter.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.185
If you knew,
why'd you have me look it up?

18:41.187 --> 18:43.254
I didn't figure it
out till just now.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.655
Thanks, Dad.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.090
Glad to help.

18:46.092 --> 18:50.194
Boys, your mother won't
be happy about this one.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.096
RON:
<i>I don't get it, K.P.</i>

18:52.098 --> 18:55.366
If Phen didn't build
that robot, who did?

18:58.804 --> 19:01.005
I constructed that robot
and you stole it!

19:01.007 --> 19:02.874
That's a dangerous accusation.

19:02.876 --> 19:04.175
I'm all about danger.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.276
Watch.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.311
Oliver! Calm down.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.412
Hello, Vivian.

19:08.414 --> 19:09.413
Phen.

19:09.415 --> 19:10.815
Ah, Kim Possible.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.817
Thank goodness you're here.
Call Security.

19:12.819 --> 19:16.020
Oh, I will. And you'll give back
the robot that you stole.

19:16.922 --> 19:18.222
You staged the whole theft

19:18.224 --> 19:19.824
to hide the fact that you never

19:19.826 --> 19:21.259
developed a thinking robot.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.027
You're not a good
enough scientist.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.096
So what? I've
got the reputation,

19:25.098 --> 19:26.130
I've got the robot,

19:26.132 --> 19:27.832
You stay away!

19:31.870 --> 19:32.837
We can cut him off.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.142
There's nowhere to run, Phen.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.110
I'm not running.

19:39.112 --> 19:40.411
You're going to let me go.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.246
I've got the precious robot.

19:42.248 --> 19:44.015
Wait! Don't do

19:44.017 --> 19:45.283
anything drastic.

19:51.256 --> 19:54.192
Looks like your
bargaining chip just flew away.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.328
Lockdown, Phen.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.896
Game over.

20:00.299 --> 20:03.868
So, Oliver,
you sure got it going on

20:03.870 --> 20:05.136
with the femininas.

20:05.138 --> 20:06.103
What's your secret?

20:06.105 --> 20:07.838
( <i>grunting</i> )

20:07.840 --> 20:12.343
Um, well, I can't...
really talk right now.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.111
I don't get it.

20:14.113 --> 20:16.247
This guy's beyond weird
and he still has babe appeal.

20:16.249 --> 20:18.416
( <i>grunting</i>)

20:18.418 --> 20:20.318
( <i>yelling</i> )

20:20.320 --> 20:22.220
Okay, I'm confused.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.960
Robot.

20:28.962 --> 20:29.994
A-ha!

20:29.996 --> 20:32.196
I knew a guy like
that had no chance

20:32.198 --> 20:33.864
with a girl like that.

20:34.499 --> 20:36.367
Wait, okay, I'm still confused.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.502
If Oliver's a robot,
who built Oliver?

20:38.504 --> 20:40.137
Dr. V.F. Porter.

20:40.139 --> 20:41.372
Who's he?

20:41.374 --> 20:43.174
<i>She's right here. Huh?</i>

20:43.176 --> 20:45.042
Dr. Vivian
Frances Porter,

20:45.044 --> 20:46.944
noted robotics authority.

20:46.946 --> 20:47.912
How'd you know?

20:47.914 --> 20:49.080
A little digging.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.481
But why the secrecy?

20:50.483 --> 20:53.951
to take someone
who looks like me seriously.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.786
Okay, wait,
time-out, time-out.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.923
So you're telling me she looks
like that <i>and</i> is a genius?

20:58.925 --> 21:00.992
You know, the rules aren't
going to like this.

21:00.994 --> 21:02.059
Back off!

21:02.061 --> 21:03.194
Or I'll destroy them both!

21:03.196 --> 21:03.995
( <i>gasps</i> )

21:06.064 --> 21:07.331
No!

21:08.333 --> 21:10.134
Put me down!

21:10.136 --> 21:11.302
Kimmie!

21:11.304 --> 21:12.770
Is everything all right?

21:12.772 --> 21:14.272
Fine. The robot's
programmed

21:14.274 --> 21:15.806
for self preservation.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.908
You'll have to walk me
through this one, honey.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.143
Long story short,

21:19.145 --> 21:20.878
Vivian: genius,

21:20.880 --> 21:22.146
Phen: fraud.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.881
She built the robots.

21:23.883 --> 21:27.285
Well, Doctor, we seem to have
a vacancy in our robotics lab.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.453
Would you be interested
in the job?

21:33.859 --> 21:36.127
This time, I <i>will</i>
<i>talk to her, Rufus.</i>

21:36.129 --> 21:37.161
Go!

21:37.163 --> 21:39.130
No need to stress.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.965
Just be myself.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.266
Hi.

21:42.268 --> 21:43.501
( <i>sniffles</i>):
Can I help you?

21:43.503 --> 21:46.270
( <i>screams</i> )

21:46.272 --> 21:48.472
What film would you like?

21:48.474 --> 21:50.508
( <i>sighs</i> ):
Whatever.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.877
Enjoy the show.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.449
So, when did you first
decide to kiss me?

21:58.451 --> 22:01.085
Before I even saw you.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.220
I was ready to dazzle her.

22:03.222 --> 22:04.555
I was so there.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.489
So where?

22:05.491 --> 22:06.457
Popcorn?

22:06.459 --> 22:07.525
Love some.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.559
Thanks.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.161
Boo-yah.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.529
Yeah.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.165
Ooh!

22:15.400 --> 22:16.867
( <i>laughs</i> )

22:16.869 --> 22:17.868
Cool.
