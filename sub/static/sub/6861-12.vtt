WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:04.605
You share a generator
with the guy

00:04.605 --> 00:06.340
in the gatehouse,
 Wade Kinsella.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.909
Notice how whenever I come
around, there's always sparks?

00:08.909 --> 00:11.045
Thank you for caring, Dr. Hart.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.380
LEMON:
 I wish there was a spell

00:12.380 --> 00:13.947
that we could use
 to just blow Zoe Hart

00:13.947 --> 00:15.349
right on out of this town.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.351
She didn't turn out to
be as bad as I thought.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.720
If you can't control
your own fiancÃ©,

00:19.720 --> 00:23.057
how in the world can you expect
to command the Memory Matrons?

00:23.057 --> 00:25.559
You are a good friend, Lavon.
You're probably my best friend

00:25.559 --> 00:27.128
in the whole world
at the moment.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.996
Judson show up?
Y'all hook up?

00:28.996 --> 00:31.199
ZOE:
 No, we did not. Judson and I...

00:31.199 --> 00:32.766
I don't think we're meant to be.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.339
* *

00:43.277 --> 00:46.514
Good morning,
lovely ladies of BlueBell!

00:46.514 --> 00:49.383
With your fancy hats and
your eyes full of wisdom.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.485
How I cherish
these moments together!

00:51.485 --> 00:53.654
What's gotten into her?

00:53.654 --> 00:55.856
Must be the drugs.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.891
Morning, Tom!

00:57.891 --> 01:00.128
Don't you look
dapper today?

01:01.995 --> 01:03.331
(faintly):
I love you.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.434
* *

01:18.179 --> 01:20.348
Wade! Hey.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.149
Hi.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.650
I am so glad you're here.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.952
I'm heading to the Dixie Stop
later to get some milk,

01:24.952 --> 01:27.755
and I thought I'd get you
those pickles you like so much.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.157
You need anything else?

01:29.157 --> 01:30.891
Shelly! Hey,
I'll have the usual.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.626
You don't have
a usual.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.761
(phone chimes)

01:33.761 --> 01:35.229
Oh. Excuse me.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.300
Is it just me, or is she
acting really weird?

01:39.300 --> 01:41.068
There's only one reason
a girl who hasn't had

01:41.068 --> 01:43.871
the company of a man for several
months is suddenly euphoric...

01:43.871 --> 01:45.473
No. Trust me, okay?

01:45.473 --> 01:47.175
It's not that. 'Cause I've
been trying for months.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.642
Maybe someone else tried harder.

01:48.642 --> 01:49.777
(laughs)

01:51.179 --> 01:53.381
LAWRENCE:
I told you I was gonna win.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.651
Congratulations, Lawrence.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.652
Thank you kindly.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.621
It was a tough case.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.689
For you, I mean.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.724
No, we both fought
hard for our clients...

02:03.724 --> 02:05.293
Yeah, but I fought
a little better.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.560
Well, I wouldn't
exactly say better...

02:06.560 --> 02:08.895
Well, you don't
have to say it.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.330
I won.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.533
That pretty much says
it all, doesn't it?

02:14.635 --> 02:17.037
Heh-heh-heh.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.207
ZOE:
 Addy...

02:19.207 --> 02:22.643
my dear, have you ever-- hi--

02:22.643 --> 02:26.180
woken up and just really,
really appreciated

02:26.180 --> 02:27.648
how beautiful life is?

02:27.648 --> 02:29.650
(patient retches)

02:29.650 --> 02:30.851
How could I not?

02:30.851 --> 02:33.654
(coughing, wheezing)

02:33.654 --> 02:35.456
Sal!

02:35.456 --> 02:37.891
Hey! How are ya, buddy?

02:37.891 --> 02:40.461
You know, I've been meaning
to come by and pick up

02:40.461 --> 02:41.995
some more of those
world-famous shrimp of yours,

02:41.995 --> 02:45.098
even though the veins still
give me the heebie-jeebies.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.301
Open up.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.538
Yeah, your pharynx
is swollen.
Yeah?

02:50.538 --> 02:52.606
All right, let's
check out your heart.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.808
If you could
unbutton for me...

02:55.676 --> 02:56.544
Ooh.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.979
Ouch. Who got
on your bad side?

02:58.979 --> 03:01.114
Oh, that's Mr. Scampi, my cat.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.483
He's got jealousy issues,

03:02.483 --> 03:04.385
he doesn't like it when
I have guests over.

03:04.385 --> 03:07.120
Lady guests, if you
know what I mean.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.856
Unfortunately, I do.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.158
So, did you start
feeling sick before

03:11.158 --> 03:12.260
or after he scratched you?

03:12.260 --> 03:13.494
I'm not sure.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.095
You know, it's probably
just the flu,

03:15.095 --> 03:18.832
but to be on the safe side, you
should get Mr. Scampi looked at.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.434
All right.
I'll just call Judson--

03:20.434 --> 03:23.404
I mean, Dr. Lyons--

03:23.404 --> 03:24.938
and, uh, have him
schedule a checkup.

03:24.938 --> 03:27.007
We're gonna get
through this together.

03:27.007 --> 03:28.476
Okay.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.646
Thank you.
Uh-huh.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.581
Next!

03:33.581 --> 03:37.718
Are you absolutely positive?

03:37.718 --> 03:40.454
Oh! Good work, AnnaBeth!
Good work!

03:40.454 --> 03:42.523
Okay. Um... I will
see you tomorrow

03:42.523 --> 03:44.425
to go over all the details
for the luncheon.

03:44.425 --> 03:47.094
Oh, and do not forget
to call the florist today.

03:47.094 --> 03:51.064
We don't want overgrown dahlias
like last time, okay?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.566
(squeals)

03:52.566 --> 03:54.468
Is that a good squeal
or a bad squeal?

03:54.468 --> 03:56.036
I just want to prepare
myself emotionally.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.338
It's official!

03:57.338 --> 03:59.106
Delia Ann is the new Chairwoman

03:59.106 --> 04:01.409
of the Alabama Junior League,
which means that the position

04:01.409 --> 04:02.610
for Memory Matron is wide open.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.044
George, do you know
what this means?

04:04.044 --> 04:05.713
That it was a good squeal?

04:05.713 --> 04:09.583
Everything I've been working so
hard for is finally paying off.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.552
Lemon Breeland, Memory Matron!

04:11.552 --> 04:12.820
Oh, it's so exciting!

04:12.820 --> 04:14.855
Very happy for you, baby.
You deserve it.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.425
Don't jinx me, George!
She hasn't appointed me yet.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.760
I need something
to seal the deal.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.829
Maybe I could do a buttering-up
diner for Delia Ann.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.531
I could make all of
her favorite dishes!

04:23.531 --> 04:25.433
I mean, but that would
seem a little desperate, huh?

04:25.433 --> 04:26.800
No, you think?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.737
Wait.

04:29.737 --> 04:31.639
Aren't you friends
with Delia Ann's husband?

04:31.639 --> 04:33.641
No, no. Lawrence just
beat me in court today,

04:33.641 --> 04:35.709
so I wouldn't necessarily
call us "friends."

04:35.709 --> 04:38.712
And I also wouldn't call us
friends because I hate him.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.714
Oh, George, you can't
let one silly little case

04:40.714 --> 04:42.483
ruin a friendship.
You two are golfing buddies!

04:42.483 --> 04:44.485
We play golf together
occasionally,

04:44.485 --> 04:46.954
which is a drag because he
is the most competitive man

04:46.954 --> 04:49.323
on the planet. He makes
us play with mulligans

04:49.323 --> 04:51.525
so he can have his
"do over" swings.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.128
Oh, no.
George...

04:55.128 --> 04:56.364
No...
Mm...

04:56.364 --> 04:58.666
No, baby...
What's one little dinner?

04:58.666 --> 05:02.703
How competitive can a man
be over a turkey pot pie?

05:06.574 --> 05:08.776
I guess we'll find out.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.950
(humming softly)

05:16.950 --> 05:18.852
Hey.

05:18.852 --> 05:22.255
I need to talk to
you about Zoe.
What about Zoe?

05:22.255 --> 05:24.392
Don't tell me you haven't
noticed all the smiling?

05:24.392 --> 05:26.627
A-All the pleasantries?
All the,

05:26.627 --> 05:28.829
the nice things she's
going out of her way to do,

05:28.829 --> 05:30.097
like buying a man
his favorite pickles

05:30.097 --> 05:31.699
even when that man
doesn't ask for them?

05:31.699 --> 05:34.535
Maybe she bought you pickles
because she likes you.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.470
Or maybe she bought
them on account of

05:36.470 --> 05:38.138
all the great sex
she's been having.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.973
Zoe isn't having sex.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.476
Or is she?

05:44.077 --> 05:48.949
As her landlord, friend
and general confidante,

05:48.949 --> 05:52.119
I'm pretty sure I would know if
she had a buddy in the boudoir.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.487
Unless it was a secret buddy.

05:53.487 --> 05:56.590
Or if it was like a death row
inmate who escaped,

05:56.590 --> 05:58.426
and she was hiding
him on account of

05:58.426 --> 06:00.961
her secret, hidden
liberal agenda.

06:00.961 --> 06:04.698
It's not one of my more popular
theories, but I kind of like it.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.834
This is really
bothering you, isn't it?

06:06.834 --> 06:08.235
"Bothering" is a
strong word, okay?

06:08.235 --> 06:11.004
It's a, it's a matter
of curiosity is all.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.408
Mm-hmm.

06:14.408 --> 06:18.245
I know how we can find out
what's really going on with Zoe.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.880
Hidden cameras. I'm right
there with you, buddy.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.749
We can go over there
and ask her.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.951
Or we could go
the obvious route.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.921
ZOE:
Hold on!

06:27.921 --> 06:28.989
Just a second!

06:28.989 --> 06:31.391
(clattering, rustling
inside house)

06:35.729 --> 06:38.198
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?

06:38.198 --> 06:39.467
We just wanted to

06:39.467 --> 06:41.401
come in for a minute.
You know, catch up.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.736
That is so sweet!

06:42.736 --> 06:46.339
Unfortunately, my place
is a complete disaster.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.642
I've had the craziest week,

06:48.642 --> 06:50.744
lots of new patients,
no time to clean.

06:50.744 --> 06:54.147
So, if you guys
don't need anything...

06:54.948 --> 06:56.283
Oh, uh, actually,

06:56.283 --> 06:59.286
it's kind of a mandatory
house meeting thing. You know?

06:59.286 --> 07:03.256
Give us a chance to talk about
our feelings and issues,

07:03.256 --> 07:06.527
kind of Real World style.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.728
Sounds incredible.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.463
Pencil me in for next week.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.666
Thanks for stopping by. Okay.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.068
(door shuts)

07:16.604 --> 07:18.839
You can come out.
They're gone.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.075
You think they saw me?

07:22.075 --> 07:23.410
Definitely not.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.012
Now...

07:25.012 --> 07:29.349
are you ready to do what I never
thought I would do in BlueBell?

07:29.349 --> 07:31.552
BOTH:
Girls' night!

07:35.188 --> 07:38.391
Well, clearly there's
a man in there.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.729
Well. I guess
that answers that.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.211
* *

07:58.211 --> 07:59.813
(remote clicks)

07:59.813 --> 08:02.049
You know, that
movie was amazing.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.951
I never ever
laughed so hard at...

08:03.951 --> 08:06.186
(whispers):
diarrhea before.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.556
AnnaBeth, you don't
have to whisper

08:08.556 --> 08:09.890
about bodily functions
in my house.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.492
Another reason I'm
having such a good time!

08:12.492 --> 08:14.628
Diarrhea! Vomit!

08:14.628 --> 08:16.029
Oh, geez.
Snot! Poop! Pee!

08:16.029 --> 08:17.531
Period! Vagina!

08:17.531 --> 08:19.933
Oh, my goodness, let's
not get carried away.
Mm-hmm.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.469
I never realized
how funny you were, AB.

08:22.469 --> 08:25.405
Thanks for calling me the other
night. I'm really glad you did.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.740
Oh! You surprised me, too.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.141
You were so brave

08:28.141 --> 08:30.911
with that whole Belle
initiation, and you helped me

08:30.911 --> 08:33.313
with my fertility situation
even though you didn't have to.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.383
And this is seriously the
best night I've had in ages.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.518
The movie. The wine...

08:38.518 --> 08:39.653
no coasters!

08:39.653 --> 08:41.520
And this pizza is incredible.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.123
It's frozen from the Dixie Stop.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.793
It tastes like cardboard
and spray cheese.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.195
Really good pizza is
the size of your face

08:48.195 --> 08:50.664
and handed to you by
a guy named Vito.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.065
Lemon doesn't allow us
to eat pizza.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.467
I do not know how
you deal with her.

08:54.467 --> 08:56.637
If you can accept the fact
that she's always right,

08:56.637 --> 08:59.306
and you're always wrong, it's
not too hard to be her friend.

08:59.306 --> 09:00.808
I couldn't do it.

09:00.808 --> 09:02.943
That's because you're
strong. You're fearless.

09:02.943 --> 09:06.046
I'm sorry I can't
tell her about us.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.848
She's going through a more
stressed-out period than normal.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.851
I just don't want to
push her over the edge.
It's really okay.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.986
I have been having fun
sneaking around.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.723
I really missed
having a girlfriend.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.825
I mean like a real friend...
someone who gets you.

09:17.825 --> 09:19.593
It was the best part
of med school.

09:19.593 --> 09:22.763
All my roommates and I, we would
hang out in the dorm rooms,

09:22.763 --> 09:24.397
drinking, talking about boys.

09:24.397 --> 09:25.699
Ooh. Boys!

09:25.699 --> 09:26.800
Let's talk about boys.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.468
My husband Jake

09:28.468 --> 09:31.972
likes to talk about the
defensive line for Auburn--

09:31.972 --> 09:33.707
while we're doing it.
Your turn.

09:33.707 --> 09:37.177
I really don't have
anything to tell.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.713
Mm-mm. Come on now.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.349
Heard a rumor about you
and that dreamboat vet,

09:42.349 --> 09:44.117
Dr. Judson Lyons.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.987
Things with Judson
are complicated.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.189
He asked me out,
but I stood him up.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.357
Then I felt really bad.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.259
I thought maybe we'd
have another chance.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.594
But then he slept
with my friend Gigi.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.463
Well, you're single.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.331
Unattached.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.733
Free, free, free.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.134
You should be having sex
with someone!

10:01.134 --> 10:04.204
Like your landlord,
Lavon Hayes.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.472
Oh, he is so gorgeous.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.575
I mean like, drop-dead-spank-
you-on-the-ass gorgeous.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.010
I'm married, so I can say that.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.012
Yeah, but Lavon is
like my brother.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.481
Then, what about
door number two?

10:14.481 --> 10:15.883
Wade Kinsella.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.617
You can see
into his window!

10:17.617 --> 10:19.352
He must sleep naked.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.788
Does he sleep naked?

10:20.788 --> 10:22.022
No.
Mm?

10:22.022 --> 10:23.156
I mean, I don't know!

10:23.156 --> 10:26.259
Okay, so Wade and I
have had some...

10:26.259 --> 10:28.128
tension.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.530
You know, we had a moment
over Christmas,

10:30.530 --> 10:33.366
but I just don't think I could
ever go there, you know?

10:33.366 --> 10:35.302
He's just so... Wade.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.670
Which equals delicious.

10:36.670 --> 10:40.040
If you don't go there...
you are crazypants!
(laughs)

10:40.040 --> 10:42.009
Let's make a list of
all the guys in town

10:42.009 --> 10:44.011
we would sleep with
if we could.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.913
Oh, man...
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna go first.

10:45.913 --> 10:48.782
Uh, Lavon Hayes.
Oh, shocking.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.650
Then Lavon Hayes again.
What do you know!

10:50.650 --> 10:51.885
And then Wade Kinsella.

10:51.885 --> 10:55.255
Oh, and Hank Doherty.
Mm-hmm.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.157
And Jeremiah...

10:57.157 --> 11:00.694
Are you sure the sunflowers
match the brie?

11:00.694 --> 11:03.530
I'm not even sure
what that means.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.332
O-Okay, baby,
don't be nervous.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.534
All right? It's gonna
be a great night.

11:07.534 --> 11:10.037
Just me and you
and the Mulligans.

11:10.037 --> 11:11.671
Oh, Lemon!
It's gonna be fine.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.672
Oh.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.942
Good evening.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.710
Welcome to our home.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.011
Thank you for
having us.

11:18.011 --> 11:21.681
What a considerate
and timely offer.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.050
(chuckles)
What you got there,
Lawrence?

11:23.050 --> 11:24.284
Brought along
some Pictionary.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.652
Thought we might play

11:25.652 --> 11:27.755
a friendly little game
after dinner,

11:27.755 --> 11:28.956
if you're interested.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.758
That is so weird!

11:30.758 --> 11:32.459
We were just talking
about Pictionary.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.560
We love Pictionary,

11:33.560 --> 11:35.062
don't we, George?
We sure do.

11:35.062 --> 11:37.397
Great. I'll just run out
to the car and get my easel.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.398
I'll be right back.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.167
(clears throat)

11:40.167 --> 11:41.601
Man brought
his own easel.

11:41.601 --> 11:44.037
I'm just saying.

11:45.739 --> 11:48.341
There are a lot of guys
it could be, you know.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.910
Hank Doherty is available.

11:49.910 --> 11:53.246
Or-or Franklin
from the bait shop.

11:53.246 --> 11:56.216
No, I don't see Zoe with
Franklin from the bait shop.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.518
The lobster tattoo alone
would be a deal breaker.

11:58.518 --> 12:01.021
Well, then someone from out
of town, someone we don't know.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.589
A New Yorker maybe.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.124
I hear J.T.'s single now.

12:04.124 --> 12:07.761
I don't think it's
Justin Timberlake, Wade.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.729
Look, Buddy,

12:09.729 --> 12:11.098
I get that this is killing you,

12:11.098 --> 12:12.900
but maybe we didn't see
what we think we did.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.134
FRED:
Hey, Lavon.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.837
Got a delivery
for Zoe Hart.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.138
Y'all think it's
from the guy

12:18.138 --> 12:19.973
she's been having
the secret sex with?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.875
Hey!
I'm just saying.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.010
I mean, there is a card.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.111
Get up out of here!

12:24.111 --> 12:26.179
I'm gonna call
my alligator.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.180
Burt Reynolds!

12:27.180 --> 12:28.916
It's not the worst idea.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.017
Ah, ah, ah!

12:30.017 --> 12:31.952
Lavon Hayes is
a man of integrity.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.486
I do not snoop.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.556
Lucky for you, Wade Kinsella
is not such a man of integrity.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.891
No...
Fake out.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.093
(clears throat)

12:42.562 --> 12:43.864
"So glad you called.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.632
"I've been thinking about you.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.001
XO, Judson."

12:48.001 --> 12:50.170
No way. Zoe would not sleep
with the guy

12:50.170 --> 12:51.839
who slept
with her alleged friend Gigi.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.206
You know what they say, Lavon.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.043
If it walks like a duck
and it sounds like a duck,

12:56.043 --> 12:59.379
then doctor of the duck
is banging Zoe Hart.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.492
Titanic?

13:12.492 --> 13:14.461
Really? Baby, I don't
remember Leo having

13:14.461 --> 13:16.796
a skull and bones flag
when he was telling Rose

13:16.796 --> 13:18.798
to never let go, never let go.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.200
Good Lord, just
guess something

13:20.200 --> 13:22.469
so we can move on already.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.236
Mutiny on the Bounty!

13:23.236 --> 13:25.372
Ooh! So close, so close, baby.

13:25.372 --> 13:26.173
So close.

13:26.173 --> 13:27.540
Joe versus the Volcano?

13:27.540 --> 13:28.909
No! So far away now.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.978
You got to just-just-just put...

13:30.978 --> 13:33.213
Pirates of the Caribbean?

13:33.213 --> 13:34.915
Yes! Yes! Did you hear that?!

13:34.915 --> 13:36.950
She said it! We win!
(whooping)

13:36.950 --> 13:38.385
Ooh-ooh-ooh.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.519
Oh, we win.

13:39.519 --> 13:40.587
We win. Uh-oh.

13:40.587 --> 13:41.588
Oh-oh.

13:41.588 --> 13:42.522
Oh, what's this?

13:42.522 --> 13:43.523
Oh.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.557
(grunting rhythmically)

13:44.557 --> 13:45.558
(chuckling)

13:46.693 --> 13:48.428
(grunting rhythmically)

13:48.428 --> 13:49.596
Oh, oh, what?

13:49.596 --> 13:52.599
Uh, I hate to interrupt
your little halftime show,

13:52.599 --> 13:53.566
but technically,

13:53.566 --> 13:54.567
we are tied.

13:54.567 --> 13:55.668
We got The Princess Bride.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.836
Oh, you did, you did.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.371
After the timer ran out.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.373
It wasn't after
the timer ran out.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.242
GEORGE:
Look, look, Lawrence,

14:02.242 --> 14:04.111
you don't have to admit that we
played better than you tonight.

14:04.111 --> 14:06.279
All you got to do
is look at the board.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.680
Now, the board says we won.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.282
And as a wise man
once told me,

14:09.282 --> 14:10.918
winning says it all, doesn't it?

14:12.953 --> 14:15.555
DELIA ANN:
Yes, well, I think

14:15.555 --> 14:19.126
I have had quite enough fun
for one evening.

14:19.126 --> 14:22.595
Oh, but, um, we haven't even
had dessert yet,

14:22.595 --> 14:25.198
and I-I made peach cobbler.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.866
George.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.202
(wry chuckle)

14:29.202 --> 14:32.039
Man, you believe that guy?

14:32.039 --> 14:35.408
Didn't even stay for cobbler.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.414
Ooh.

14:41.414 --> 14:42.215
(knocking)

14:42.215 --> 14:43.917
LAVON:
I come bearing gifts.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.189
Mm.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.158
Surprised you
let me in.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.760
Wow. Who are these from?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.462
No point in
pretending.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.431
Now, I'm... I'm happy you're
having sex with someone, Z.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.300
I'm a little surprised
by the choice, but...

15:00.300 --> 15:01.768
I'm not sleeping with Judson.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.036
Well, it sure
seems that way.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.038
The happy glow, the
sneaking around,

15:05.038 --> 15:07.440
the not letting me
and Wade in tonight.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.243
All right, look,
if I tell you what's going on,

15:10.243 --> 15:12.279
do you swear not to tell anyone?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.214
Yeah.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.384
I was hiding AnnaBeth.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.655
Oh, no! Ew!

15:22.655 --> 15:23.656
We're just friends.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.092
Friends who make out?

15:25.092 --> 15:26.226
Friends who are friends.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.661
Friends who sometimes make out?

15:29.529 --> 15:31.364
I see.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.933
And no one is allowed
to know this because...?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.302
It's not that
no one can know this.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.803
It's that Lemon can't know this.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.538
AnnaBeth and Lemon
are really close,

15:38.538 --> 15:39.772
but Lemon hates me.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.374
And apparently, right now

15:41.374 --> 15:43.210
she's even more screwy
than usual

15:43.210 --> 15:44.644
because of some Memory Madame.

15:44.644 --> 15:45.512
Memory Matron.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.080
Yeah. So AnnaBeth doesn't think

15:47.080 --> 15:48.781
this would be a good time
to tell her.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.617
But eventually she's going
to tell people, right?

15:50.617 --> 15:54.721
Yeah, you know, well, I just,
I think it's difficult for her,

15:54.721 --> 15:56.156
and I'm not so sure

15:56.156 --> 15:58.258
that her friends and family
would embrace me.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.360
But she's my friend,
and I am

16:00.360 --> 16:02.629
really, really happy
to have a girlfriend.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.364
So I'm just trying
to be understanding.

16:04.364 --> 16:06.133
That's what all mistresses say.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.534
I'm not a mistress.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.535
Really?

16:08.535 --> 16:11.138
Well, you're sneaking around,
lying,

16:11.138 --> 16:12.905
keeping your relationship
a secret. (chuckles)

16:12.905 --> 16:15.108
That's the very definition
of a mistress right there.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.576
You're making a bigger deal
of this than it is.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.511
I'm just calling it
like I see it.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.181
If I asked her to,
if I said that it was important,

16:21.181 --> 16:24.051
I'm sure that AnnaBeth
would out us.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.918
Then ask her.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.987
'Cause a real friend

16:27.987 --> 16:30.323
is someone you can walk
through town with.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.059
Fine.

16:37.464 --> 16:38.998
(line ringing)

16:38.998 --> 16:40.600
(cell phone ringtone playing)

16:40.600 --> 16:41.801
Hello.

16:41.801 --> 16:42.902
Hey, AnnaBeth, it's me.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.371
Listen, I think
that we should...

16:44.371 --> 16:45.672
Sorry!

16:45.672 --> 16:48.141
I'm not interested in
any subscriptions today.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.443
Thanks... Carl.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.947
Oh, my God.

16:54.947 --> 16:57.084
I am a mistress.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.652
A mistress named Carl.

17:05.724 --> 17:09.061
AnnaBeth, I don't mean
to stalk you,

17:09.061 --> 17:11.631
but I really need
to talk to you.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.200
Will you call me?

17:13.200 --> 17:15.535
It's... Carl.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.769
Hey, Zoe.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.172
So, I checked out that
cat you asked me about.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.473
O-Oh, great.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.609
This is gonna sound so cheesy.

17:23.609 --> 17:25.944
You just get prettier
every time I see you.

17:25.944 --> 17:28.214
You're right, it sounds cheesy.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.016
Never been too good
at flirting, so...

17:30.016 --> 17:32.452
Maybe next time don't start
with: "This may sound cheesy."

17:32.452 --> 17:33.953
Kind of gives away your game.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.788
So how did it go

17:35.788 --> 17:37.023
with Mr. Scampi?

17:37.023 --> 17:38.391
Poor little guy
had what's called

17:38.391 --> 17:39.992
Bartonella henselae
infection,

17:39.992 --> 17:41.628
otherwise known as
cat scratch fever.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.496
He probably just caught it
from some fleas.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.165
And he probably gave it to Sal.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.533
I'll get him a prescription
for Azithromycin.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.967
Thanks for getting back to me.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.836
Yeah, no problem.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.571
Did you get my flowers?

17:51.571 --> 17:52.939
Yeah, I did.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.107
And the note.

17:54.107 --> 17:57.210
I've been thinking
about you, Zoe.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.945
A lot, actually.

17:58.945 --> 17:59.979
Look at you.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.481
Flirting better already.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.649
You're a quick learner.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.083
Does that mean I can
buy you breakfast?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.119
I don't think so.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.587
But "A" for effort, Doctor.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.489
Well, thank you.

18:09.489 --> 18:11.124
All right, I'll see you later.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.825
Bye.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.999
Huh, she doesn't seem
that interested in him.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.335
So, they're not together?

18:22.335 --> 18:23.970
Oh, no, they're
totally together.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.173
Thanks.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.343
Joelle Sugarbaker!

18:30.343 --> 18:32.245
Looking fine as ever.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.148
What do you say I buy you
a cup of coffee?

18:35.148 --> 18:36.883
You sure can.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.523
(cell phone ringtone playing)

18:45.825 --> 18:47.194
You've been quite
popular this morning.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.795
Who in the world
is calling you?

18:48.795 --> 18:50.230
Uh, my Aunt Irene.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.498
She's a little senile.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.099
Okay, AnnaBeth,
you need to make sure

18:53.099 --> 18:54.567
that the ribbons are
curled properly, okay?

18:54.567 --> 18:57.036
See? Easy as pie.
Do them again, won't you?

18:57.036 --> 18:58.338
Quick, like a bunny.
Mm-hmm.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.207
How many women you got
coming to at this thing?

19:00.207 --> 19:02.342
This "thing" is a luncheon to
honor Delia Ann's promotion.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.743
You remember her, right?

19:03.743 --> 19:05.712
She's the woman you told
to "suck it" last night.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.180
I was just trying to
keep up with Lawrence.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.115
Well, congratulations.
You succeeded.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.717
Was I really that bad?
Oh, yes, dear,

19:10.717 --> 19:12.785
you really were that bad, but
I don't have time to be angry,

19:12.785 --> 19:13.820
so you get a free pass.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.054
I'll take it.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.323
Love you.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.057
Okay, AnnaBeth, I need
to go talk to my Daddy

19:18.057 --> 19:20.159
about the scotch, and you keep
working on the centerpieces,

19:20.159 --> 19:22.795
'cause honestly, it looks
like a second grader did them.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.867
I got your text.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.068
Look, I know you're busy.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.803
But I really need
to talk to you.

19:30.803 --> 19:31.804
Okay? Call me, Ann...

19:31.804 --> 19:33.806
Addy?

19:35.542 --> 19:36.809
Addy?

19:40.079 --> 19:41.781
What is your problem?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.716
Me?

19:43.716 --> 19:45.218
Nothing.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.854
Why do you look all... stuck?

19:47.854 --> 19:49.922
Oh. Stiff joints.

19:49.922 --> 19:53.826
Oh, yeah. They freeze up
sometimes. Weird, huh?

19:53.826 --> 19:55.362
Uh, Sal's back.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.897
Sal? Oh, great.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.832
I'll go to the exam room
and catch up with Sal.

19:59.832 --> 20:00.833
Good-bye, Lemon.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.638
Is it just me or is she
acting stranger than normal?

20:05.638 --> 20:07.274
That depends on what
you consider normal.

20:07.274 --> 20:08.641
What can I help you with, Lemon?

20:08.641 --> 20:11.811
I'm having a huge,
extremely important luncheon

20:11.811 --> 20:14.113
for Delia Ann Lee,
which is why it is imperative

20:14.113 --> 20:15.548
that I have Daddy's best scotch.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.849
Well, Brick's in with
a patient right now,

20:16.849 --> 20:18.785
but you know where he
hides the good stuff.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.520
Be my guest.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.456
How could you have
lost the prescription?

20:23.456 --> 20:24.791
I had Addy hand-deliver
it to you.

20:24.791 --> 20:26.659
I don't know.
I just lost it.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.695
I get so absentminded sometimes,
I don't know what I'm doing.

20:28.695 --> 20:31.431
But you just said that
you've been feeling better,

20:31.431 --> 20:33.266
which would indicate
that you've been taking

20:33.266 --> 20:34.834
the prescribed medication.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.769
Which would also indicate that
you didn't lose anything.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.672
Dang. You're like
a doctor detective.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.408
ZOE:
What's going on, Sal?

20:41.408 --> 20:43.810
Mr. Scampi scratched my
lady friend last night,

20:43.810 --> 20:46.313
and his medication
hasn't come in yet,

20:46.313 --> 20:47.714
which means he's
still sick,

20:47.714 --> 20:50.116
which means he probably
gave her what I just got.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.352
Possibly. Why don't you
have your "lady friend"

20:52.352 --> 20:54.220
come in and see me,
and I'd be happy to

20:54.220 --> 20:56.689
prescribe her the antibiotics
after I give her an exam.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.558
The thing is, she's married.

20:58.558 --> 21:01.260
She ain't coming in.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.396
She don't want anybody
to know about us.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.865
Oh, I see.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.099
So you're a mister.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.768
You know, like a mistress?

21:08.768 --> 21:10.403
But you're a man,
so I said mister.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.704
I see how that's confusing.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.906
The point is, she is
treating you like a chump.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.442
Well, it's not like that.
She loves me.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.009
Really?
Yeah.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.746
Does she make you wait
around until she's free?
Yeah.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.147
Does she return your phone calls

21:21.147 --> 21:23.583
even after you've
called her four times?
No.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.251
You have to stop letting
her treat you like this.

21:25.251 --> 21:28.555
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Ask her to pick one of us?

21:28.555 --> 21:32.692
Yes! That is exactly what
we're supposed to do.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.427
I mean you.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.396
What you are supposed to do.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.266
So, you're not going to
give me the prescription?

21:40.266 --> 21:42.569
No. She can come in and see me,

21:42.569 --> 21:44.971
or she can go to Mobile
if she wants discretion.

21:44.971 --> 21:48.007
I will no longer
aid in covering up
someone's secrets.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.343
ZOE:
Go.

21:50.343 --> 21:52.445
Faster.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.683
(sighs)

22:13.733 --> 22:17.637
AnnaBeth,
I can't do this anymore.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.540
I don't want
to be a mistress.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.542
You're gonna have to choose.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.478
It's either Lemon or me.

22:38.425 --> 22:39.826
(phone rings)

22:39.826 --> 22:40.760
Hello?

22:40.760 --> 22:43.596
Zoe, hey, it's Judson.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.964
Oh, hey, Judson.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.065
Listen, I just want

22:46.065 --> 22:47.133
to make it clear...

22:47.133 --> 22:48.334
I like you.

22:48.334 --> 22:50.670
Sleeping with Gigi was wrong
and stupid.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.072
And I so hope you'd give me
a second chance.

22:53.072 --> 22:56.543
I appreciate the effort,
the flowers and the romance,

22:56.543 --> 22:59.011
but I'm just kind of
distracted right now.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.346
It isn't a good time.

23:00.346 --> 23:03.550
Oh. Okay.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.317
But, Judson, I like you, too.

23:05.317 --> 23:08.721
Oh. Okay.

23:08.721 --> 23:09.756
Bye.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.964
How about that?
She likes me, too.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.133
That's what I said.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.301
Judson, huh?

23:22.301 --> 23:24.170
How's that
good ol' boy doing?

23:24.170 --> 23:26.506
Fine, I guess.

23:26.506 --> 23:28.007
Hmm, peanut butter.

23:28.007 --> 23:29.108
Yoink!

23:29.108 --> 23:30.610
Hey, I was using that!

23:30.610 --> 23:32.612
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see your name on it.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.946
What the hell is your problem?

23:33.946 --> 23:35.515
Me? No problem.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.283
I'm peachy keen, jelly bean.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.918
JOELLE:
There you are.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.186
Hey, baby.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.524
(Wade moans, chuckles)

23:47.627 --> 23:49.295
What're you looking at?

23:49.295 --> 23:50.362
Yeah, Doc?

23:50.362 --> 23:52.632
What are you
looking at?

23:52.632 --> 23:54.534
You seem intrigued.
Want to join in?

23:54.534 --> 23:56.035
You are an infant.

23:57.403 --> 23:58.605
(phone chimes)

24:07.647 --> 24:09.315
ANNABETH:
 I'm sorry, but I told you,

24:09.315 --> 24:11.718
it's not a good time to tell her
about us. Lemon is...

24:11.718 --> 24:12.985
Crazier than usual?

24:12.985 --> 24:14.821
She's always gonna
be crazier than usual.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.322
You know why?
Because she's crazy!

24:16.322 --> 24:17.690
I want to tell her, I do,

24:17.690 --> 24:19.759
but I'm just so bad
with confrontation.

24:19.759 --> 24:21.193
Like yesterday,
I thought I came up

24:21.193 --> 24:22.962
with this really good idea
to have petit fours

24:22.962 --> 24:24.263
at today's luncheon
for Delia Ann,

24:24.263 --> 24:25.331
but Lemon shot me down,

24:25.331 --> 24:26.566
and I just caved.

24:26.566 --> 24:28.100
You can't let people walk
all over you

24:28.100 --> 24:30.603
for the rest of your life
because you're afraid of them.

24:30.603 --> 24:31.838
I don't mind, really.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.305
Look, I was the only woman

24:33.305 --> 24:34.406
in my surgical residency.

24:34.406 --> 24:35.775
Do you think

24:35.775 --> 24:38.210
any of those doctors
would have taken me seriously

24:38.210 --> 24:39.512
if I didn't assert myself?

24:39.512 --> 24:40.647
Let me help you!

24:40.647 --> 24:43.015
I don't know, Zoe.
Oh, come on.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.184
You're always saying that you
like the fact that I'm brave.

24:45.184 --> 24:47.687
Why don't we see if we can make
you a little fearless, too.

24:47.687 --> 24:51.624
(mimics Lemon):
AnnaBeth, that apple
looks enticing.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.060
And I haven't eaten an
itty-bitty thing all day.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.362
I should probably wash it
for you first.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.464
No! Do not let her
take your apple

24:58.464 --> 25:00.066
and do not wash
it for her!

25:00.066 --> 25:01.601
Oh, right.
Sorry.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.803
* *

25:07.774 --> 25:10.076
(mimics Lemon):
I need a tissue.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.177
Now!

25:11.177 --> 25:14.146
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't have any on me.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.948
Heavens to Betsy!
What kind of belle

25:15.948 --> 25:17.684
doesn't carry a
tissue with her?

25:17.684 --> 25:18.785
Have I taught
you nothing?

25:18.785 --> 25:20.052
I'm so sorry.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.221
I'll go to the bathroom
and get you one.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.155
Uh!

25:23.155 --> 25:25.291
Oh, shoot,
that's wrong, right?

25:25.291 --> 25:26.959
(groans)

25:28.027 --> 25:31.163
I'm sorry,
this is my apple.

25:31.163 --> 25:34.300
I said my apple.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.603
Touch it
and you lose an arm!

25:37.203 --> 25:39.305
Hey!
Whoo!

25:41.808 --> 25:43.342
This stuff sure looks fancy.

25:43.342 --> 25:46.078
I can't even pronounce the names
of some of these.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.581
Want to do body shots?

25:48.581 --> 25:51.383
(chuckles)
Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.653
I'm just gonna see if

25:53.653 --> 25:56.222
Lavon has any lemons
in the fridge.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.294
Dumbass pickles.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.229
What?

26:03.229 --> 26:04.631
Nothing. Hey, you know what?

26:04.631 --> 26:06.633
Uh, forget the body shots.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.935
Just, uh, just come here.

26:13.205 --> 26:15.708
Stupid peanut butter.
I'll bet Dr. Perfect doesn't

26:15.708 --> 26:17.076
stick his fingers
in the peanut butter jar.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.544
He's such a damn grown-up.

26:18.544 --> 26:20.613
Why are you talking
to the peanut butter?

26:20.613 --> 26:21.614
Are you okay?

26:21.614 --> 26:23.082
I'm, I'm fine, okay?

26:23.082 --> 26:24.150
I just..

26:24.150 --> 26:26.485
I need to get to work.

26:26.485 --> 26:28.554
No problem.

26:28.554 --> 26:29.956
If you change
your mind,

26:29.956 --> 26:31.658
you know where
to find me.

26:35.762 --> 26:38.097
Delia Ann, it must
be so rewarding

26:38.097 --> 26:40.166
to have all
these people here

26:40.166 --> 26:42.869
to honor your impressive
career as Memory Matron.

26:42.869 --> 26:45.037
I hope to follow in
your footsteps one day.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.773
Yes, I'm sure
you do, Lemon.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.175
Um, and I wanted to apologize
about the other night.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.610
Our menfolk got a little
carried away. (chuckles)

26:51.610 --> 26:53.980
I realize it would
be unfair to punish you

26:53.980 --> 26:56.482
for George's absurdly
inappropriate behavior.

26:56.482 --> 26:59.451
Well, um, to be fair,

26:59.451 --> 27:00.820
Lawrence did bring
his own easel.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.555
How dare you insult my husband.

27:03.555 --> 27:07.393
Lawrence is a proud Southern man
who believes in sportsmanship!

27:07.393 --> 27:08.961
No, I didn't mean to...!

27:08.961 --> 27:10.096
What's wrong with Delia Ann?

27:10.096 --> 27:12.732
Mind your own business,
Crickett!

27:15.968 --> 27:18.637
Bubbly water.
Keep it coming.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.144
AnnaBeth, are
those petit fours?

27:25.144 --> 27:27.747
Have you suffered
a head injury?

27:27.747 --> 27:29.415
I told you no.

27:29.415 --> 27:33.485
Sorry, Lemon,
I got confused.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.755
(snaps fingers thrice)

27:37.256 --> 27:38.357
No, I didn't.

27:38.357 --> 27:41.093
As usual, you just
commanded us to do whatever

27:41.093 --> 27:42.261
you want without asking what

27:42.261 --> 27:43.996
anyone else thought
about it first!

27:43.996 --> 27:46.332
Excuse me?
No, it's time
you listened to me for once.

27:46.332 --> 27:49.902
I happen to have great
ideas, and for the record,

27:49.902 --> 27:51.938
everyone is just
sick to death

27:51.938 --> 27:53.940
of your dreadful cherry tortes!

27:58.711 --> 28:01.113
See, now that's
the kind of spirit

28:01.113 --> 28:05.051
I'm looking for
in a Memory Matron.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.575
Thank you for coming.

28:29.575 --> 28:32.511
I knew AnnaBeth was trying
weasel her way to the top.

28:32.511 --> 28:33.913
If anyone other
than you were

28:33.913 --> 28:36.182
to be named Memory Matron,
it should at least be me.

28:36.182 --> 28:39.518
I am the one
with the porcelain skin.

28:39.518 --> 28:42.254
Although it's still
definitely gonna be you.

28:44.323 --> 28:46.926
Oh, wait, wait, stop!
Don't forget your party favor.

28:46.926 --> 28:49.128
It's handmade soap.
I made it from scratch.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.563
Just one of the many traditions
I like to preserve.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.899
(soap hits floor)

28:52.899 --> 28:54.100
Oh, I'm sorry.

28:55.534 --> 28:57.636
Ooh.

28:57.636 --> 28:58.905
What are you staring at?

28:58.905 --> 29:00.372
You have
a nasty little scratch

29:00.372 --> 29:02.608
on the back of your neck.
It's just a cat scratch.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.543
Oh, honestly, Lemon, you are
becoming quite bothersome.

29:04.543 --> 29:08.347
AnnaBeth, would you care
to join me for dinner?

29:08.347 --> 29:09.748
I'd love to.

29:16.522 --> 29:17.890
(agitated sigh)

29:17.890 --> 29:19.826
Crickett, I don't recall

29:19.826 --> 29:22.428
Delia Ann having
a cat, do you?

29:26.465 --> 29:28.467
(bicycle bell rings)

29:28.467 --> 29:30.903
Oh, my gosh, the petit fours
went over so well,

29:30.903 --> 29:32.872
Delia Ann is taking me
to dinner tonight!

29:32.872 --> 29:34.140
That's amazing!

29:34.140 --> 29:35.541
And it's all thanks to you.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.243
After dinner,
I'm telling Lemon everything,

29:37.243 --> 29:40.046
and then you and I are going out
on the town to celebrate.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.580
You are on, girlfriend!

29:41.580 --> 29:43.482
Okay, girlfriend.

29:43.482 --> 29:44.750
I am on.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.552
Hey, Sal.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.287
How goes it, buddy?

29:48.287 --> 29:49.121
(sobbing)

29:49.121 --> 29:52.658
Whoa...
Keep it together.

29:52.658 --> 29:54.193
It can't be
that bad.

29:54.193 --> 29:56.195
I got nothing
to live for anymore!

29:56.195 --> 29:57.964
I took your advice and asked

29:57.964 --> 30:00.132
my lady friend
to choose between me

30:00.132 --> 30:02.368
and her husband and,
as you can see,

30:02.368 --> 30:04.971
I'm the loser sitting here
drinking all alone.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.673
You're not a loser, Sal.
You may be a little drunk

30:07.673 --> 30:10.442
for 3:00 in the afternoon,
but hey, I don't judge.

30:10.442 --> 30:13.612
Although, FYI, it's
really not a great thing

30:13.612 --> 30:15.481
to mix alcohol
with antibiotics.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.715
(sobbing)

30:16.715 --> 30:19.651
Advice for another
time, perhaps.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.920
Let's focus on you, Sal.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.454
It was a mistake.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.723
I never should've
given her that ultimatum.

30:24.723 --> 30:26.825
No, hey, you did the
right thing, okay?

30:26.825 --> 30:29.661
This woman didn't appreciate
you for how great you are.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.398
The right person
will, trust me.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.100
Now you need to go home
and get some rest.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.301
Doctor's orders.

30:36.869 --> 30:39.238
No, let's not do that.

30:39.238 --> 30:40.739
All right.

30:40.739 --> 30:45.244
Okay, ooh. Yep, there... Okay.

30:45.244 --> 30:46.245
(sighs)

30:53.652 --> 30:55.254
Ooh, watch that backhand, see?

31:02.428 --> 31:04.496
Are we gonna talk about it?
No.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.966
Okay, then.

31:09.568 --> 31:10.602
Look, for the record,

31:10.602 --> 31:12.838
veterinarians should
not be called doctors.

31:12.838 --> 31:14.340
They don't even go
to medical school.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.275
No, they go
to vet school,

31:16.275 --> 31:18.610
which I hear is
more competitive.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.112
Whose side are you on?

31:20.112 --> 31:21.413
I didn't realize
there were official teams.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.382
Well, there are.
Well, as far
as I can tell,

31:23.382 --> 31:24.816
you still haven't thrown
your hat in the ring.

31:24.816 --> 31:27.453
There's no point, Lavon, okay?

31:27.453 --> 31:30.789
Zoe's... she's made her choice.

31:30.789 --> 31:31.823
Zoe is not with Judson.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.292
Yes, she is.
No, she's not.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.660
Yes, she is.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.395
I'm gonna smack you.

31:39.765 --> 31:42.801
Now I know for a fact
that Zoe Hart

31:42.801 --> 31:44.503
is 100% single.

31:51.277 --> 31:52.444
(sighs)

31:52.444 --> 31:54.513
Zoe's sneaking
around with a girl.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.317
No, not like that.

31:59.851 --> 32:02.921
She has a closet
nonsexual girlfriend.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.124
(both laugh)

32:05.124 --> 32:08.194
I would've told you earlier,

32:08.194 --> 32:12.198
but I swore I wouldn't
tell anybody, so...

32:12.198 --> 32:15.201
Wade, you're a good guy.

32:15.201 --> 32:16.535
But if you want Zoe,

32:16.535 --> 32:19.071
you gotta stop pulling
her pigtails and be a man.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.939
Meaning what exactly, Lavon?

32:20.939 --> 32:21.974
Comb your damn hair, huh?

32:21.974 --> 32:25.044
Put on a clean shirt.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.546
Zoe may not be
with Judson today,

32:27.546 --> 32:30.249
but there are a lot
of other Judsons out there,

32:30.249 --> 32:32.318
serious men with adult
responsibilities,

32:32.318 --> 32:35.121
who have the sense
to tell the girl how they feel.

32:35.121 --> 32:37.623
But right now,
there is no one else.

32:37.623 --> 32:41.493
The only thing keeping you from
being with Zoe Hart is you.

32:49.235 --> 32:51.303
Hey.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.272
Thought we were
having dinner tonight.

32:53.272 --> 32:55.041
Can't. Have to go fix everything

32:55.041 --> 32:57.343
that you screwed up
for me with Delia Ann.
What are you talking about?

32:57.343 --> 32:58.910
This morning you said
everything was fine.

32:58.910 --> 33:01.113
Yeah, well, this morning I
didn't know she was considering

33:01.113 --> 33:02.481
making AnnaBeth Memory Matron.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.583
Luckily for me, I found out
a juicy little tidbit,

33:04.583 --> 33:06.452
so she'll have to pick me.
You're kidding, right?

33:06.452 --> 33:07.986
Do I seem like I'm kidding?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.456
Okay, Lemon, hold on
a second.
I told you, I have to go!

33:10.456 --> 33:12.724
Lemon, stop.

33:12.724 --> 33:15.627
This... craziness
ends now.

33:15.627 --> 33:16.828
Do you hear me?

33:16.828 --> 33:18.597
'Cause you've been
acting insane for weeks.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.332
'Cause Memory Matron
is important to me.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.568
Well, nothing is worth crossing
this kind of line, Lemon.

33:22.568 --> 33:25.804
And if you so much as knock
on Delia Ann's door tonight,

33:25.804 --> 33:28.640
do not bother calling me again,
because there is only so much

33:28.640 --> 33:31.343
I am willing to put up with,
Lemon. There's only so much.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.212
(door opens, door slams shut)

33:33.212 --> 33:35.214
(knock at door)

33:35.214 --> 33:38.084
Zoe, it's me.

33:38.084 --> 33:41.553
You are looking at
the next Memory Matron!

33:41.553 --> 33:42.888
(both squeal)

33:42.888 --> 33:44.356
I'm so happy for you!

33:44.356 --> 33:46.958
Where are we
going to celebrate?

33:46.958 --> 33:49.328
Well, the thing is...

33:49.328 --> 33:51.830
now that I am about to
become a highly esteemed

33:51.830 --> 33:53.632
member of the community,

33:53.632 --> 33:55.601
it's probably not the best
time to be seen with you.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.436
From a political
standpoint, that is.

33:57.436 --> 33:58.904
Very funny.

33:58.904 --> 34:02.040
Zoe, you are still
pretty unpopular.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.643
The Breelands,
well, they hate you.

34:04.643 --> 34:07.346
Plus, people are still
complaining about the parade

34:07.346 --> 34:08.714
and the homecoming party.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.482
And you did accuse
the minister of cheating and...

34:10.482 --> 34:12.016
Wait. Let me get this straight.

34:12.016 --> 34:17.223
I help you achieve the greatest
success of your life...

34:17.223 --> 34:18.790
and you break up with me?

34:18.790 --> 34:21.693
I wish more than anything

34:21.693 --> 34:24.996
that I could be Memory Matron
and your friend,

34:24.996 --> 34:27.599
because you're cool

34:27.599 --> 34:30.702
and smart and funny.

34:30.702 --> 34:33.038
But this is a small town.

34:33.038 --> 34:37.943
And Memory Matron, well...
that's a dream come true for me.

34:37.943 --> 34:40.146
I'm so sorry.

34:44.416 --> 34:48.286
I guess this is
a good-bye gift, then.

34:50.156 --> 34:53.058
(choking up):
An apple.

34:53.058 --> 34:56.862
It's perfect.

34:58.764 --> 35:02.668
I will miss you, Zoe Hart.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.605
Me, too.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.617
* *

35:35.301 --> 35:38.537
You, uh, avoiding
anyone in particular?

35:38.537 --> 35:39.905
People who are nice to me.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.040
'Cause then I feel
obligated to be nice back.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.243
Which makes you the perfect
person to be around.

35:44.243 --> 35:46.378
I will take that
as a compliment.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.613
Go suck a rock.

35:47.613 --> 35:49.715
That's my girl.
Feel better?

35:49.715 --> 35:51.450
A little bit, yeah.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.052
On the house.

35:54.052 --> 35:57.122
You are a freak,
you know that?

35:57.122 --> 35:58.724
I'm nice to you,
you're a jerk.

35:58.724 --> 36:01.126
I tell you to suck a rock,
you're pouring me free wine.

36:01.126 --> 36:03.729
I'm working on it
with my therapist.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.264
So...

36:05.264 --> 36:06.398
who peed in your cornflakes?

36:06.398 --> 36:09.401
Nobody important, it turns out.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.137
I just missed
having a girlfriend.

36:12.137 --> 36:15.741
Look, Zoe...
a friend's a friend.

36:15.741 --> 36:18.377
Male, female, who
gives a damn?

36:18.377 --> 36:21.380
You got Lavon,
you got George Tucker...

36:21.380 --> 36:24.750
As long as you got someone
to back you in a knife fight,

36:24.750 --> 36:26.585
I'd say you're doing
all right in my book.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.888
Why do you look different?

36:29.888 --> 36:31.757
New shirt.

36:31.757 --> 36:33.792
It looks nice on you.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.662
DELIA ANN:
Come along, ladies.

36:40.432 --> 36:41.700
I'll be in the corner.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.201
I'll take the whole bottle.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.640
* *

36:57.182 --> 36:58.784
Hey, sit down.
I'll buy you a drink.

36:58.784 --> 37:01.052
No, that's all right.
I'm just gonna...

37:01.052 --> 37:03.054
I know I've been an ass, George.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.257
Just let me buy you a drink.

37:12.898 --> 37:14.165
Scotch.

37:14.165 --> 37:17.503
Neat, please.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.139
Look, I've been an ass, too.

37:21.139 --> 37:23.008
And I am, uh...

37:23.008 --> 37:24.410
(laughs)

37:24.410 --> 37:25.677
Well, I'm sorry
about last night.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.679
(chuckles)
I-I don't...

37:27.679 --> 37:30.416
No, no, no. Listen, when you're
with the kind of women we are,

37:30.416 --> 37:32.017
sometimes, you need an outlet.

37:32.017 --> 37:33.285
Yeah.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.020
For me it's, uh,
it's the courtroom

37:35.020 --> 37:37.356
or a golf course.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.558
And these.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.294
I'll have another.

37:42.294 --> 37:44.563
Make it a double.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.101
Rough night?

37:50.101 --> 37:52.971
Rough year.

37:52.971 --> 37:58.710
Started out her just
being moody and withdrawn.

38:00.512 --> 38:02.113
Then she started having these

38:02.113 --> 38:04.716
irrational bursts
of anger at me.

38:06.518 --> 38:10.622
Now, it's like she's
a stranger in my bed.

38:10.622 --> 38:14.025
She's been keeping me at
arm's length for so long now,

38:14.025 --> 38:17.028
I don't know, uh...

38:17.028 --> 38:18.564
how to get her back.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.535
Ooh, huh, whoa...

38:23.535 --> 38:26.171
You're young, engaged.

38:26.171 --> 38:28.974
Don't mean to bring you
down with boring tales

38:28.974 --> 38:31.009
of an old married couple.

38:39.551 --> 38:42.688
DELIA ANN:
Greetings, people
of BlueBell.

38:42.688 --> 38:45.791
It is with a heavy heart
that I must resign

38:45.791 --> 38:47.325
from my post
as Memory Matron.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.461
It has been an honor

38:49.461 --> 38:51.597
serving all of you

38:51.597 --> 38:54.666
and preserving
our fine traditions.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.034
(applause)
Oh, no, no, no, no...

38:58.269 --> 38:59.871
With that,

38:59.871 --> 39:03.008
it is truly a thrill
to introduce to you

39:03.008 --> 39:05.043
your new Memory Matron,

39:05.043 --> 39:07.045
Mrs. AnnaBeth Nass!

39:11.550 --> 39:13.752
Thank you so much!

39:13.752 --> 39:16.855
There are so many people
I want to thank.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.590
Uh, Crickett,
would you be a dear

39:18.590 --> 39:20.692
and get my speech out of my bag?

39:20.692 --> 39:23.429
But first, let's all give
another round of applause

39:23.429 --> 39:24.596
to Delia Ann,

39:24.596 --> 39:27.933
a true hero and
inspiration to us all.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.838
What in the world...?

39:32.838 --> 39:34.840
Allow me.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.343
Here's your speech, sugarplum.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.846
Why, thank you, Lemon...

39:40.846 --> 39:43.749
And here's a keychain
engraved to you by Zoe Hart.

39:43.749 --> 39:47.786
Which is peculiar, considering
you two aren't even friends.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.387
Or are you?

39:55.761 --> 39:58.129
Care to explain yourself,
AnnaBeth?

39:58.129 --> 39:59.431
What?

39:59.431 --> 40:01.299
I mean, there's
nothing to explain.

40:01.299 --> 40:03.902
LEMON:
It's really a simple question.
Are you or are you not

40:03.902 --> 40:06.838
carrying on a secret
relationship with Zoe Hart?

40:06.838 --> 40:08.039
Of course not!

40:08.039 --> 40:10.108
Oh, it all makes sense now,
doesn't it?

40:10.108 --> 40:11.242
Your sudden defiance,

40:11.242 --> 40:14.012
why Zoe Hart has been
acting crazier than usual.

40:14.012 --> 40:16.882
It was you she was hiding.
Admit it!

40:16.882 --> 40:18.584
I...

40:20.519 --> 40:23.689
My keychain!

40:25.090 --> 40:26.525
Pardon me. Excuse me.

40:26.525 --> 40:27.793
Pardon me.

40:27.793 --> 40:30.762
Um, I was wondering
where it went.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.664
I must have dropped it.

40:32.664 --> 40:36.535
Dropped a keychain
engraved to yourself?

40:37.736 --> 40:39.204
Um...

40:39.204 --> 40:40.672
Peaches!

40:42.508 --> 40:45.143
I got this for you.

40:45.143 --> 40:46.678
For me?

40:46.678 --> 40:49.414
It's the key
to my carriage house.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.550
I decided that
I didn't want to

40:51.550 --> 40:53.018
hide our relationship anymore.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.020
Our what?

41:12.538 --> 41:15.173
Obviously, I'm a part of
something I don't understand,

41:15.173 --> 41:17.609
but I just want
to say, I don't care.

41:17.609 --> 41:18.810
'Cause that kiss was...

41:18.810 --> 41:21.246
Worth taking another shot at.

41:27.018 --> 41:29.020
* *

41:32.724 --> 41:35.761
Hey, Joelle. It's Wade.

41:35.761 --> 41:38.296
Yeah, I'm feeling like
doing those body shots.

41:38.296 --> 41:40.999

41:40.999 --> 41:45.804
