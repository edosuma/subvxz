Ma'am? It's 132.21.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.006
So, big plans this weekend?
- Yep.

00:50.092 --> 00:53.261
I'm gonna sit alone in my house
watching wedding fails on YouTube

00:53.345 --> 00:55.346
drinking margaritas
through a Twizzler straw

00:55.430 --> 00:57.265
until I pass out on top of my vibrator.

00:59.935 --> 01:02.311
Hi there. Do you have a second
to talk about the environment?

01:02.396 --> 01:04.063
No. Buzz off, whale-humper.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.859
You know, I see you here all the time,
and you're always mean to me

01:08.944 --> 01:11.195
and it really hurts my feelings.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.906
It does? Because the minute
you're out of my line of sight

01:13.991 --> 01:15.491
I literally forget you exist.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.578
Watch. You exist... You don't exist.

01:18.662 --> 01:21.497
You're bothering me...
Don't care if you die. See?

01:22.958 --> 01:24.000
Why are you like this?

01:26.086 --> 01:28.254
Excuse me? Why am I like this?

01:28.338 --> 01:30.756
You don't know me, dude.
You don't know what I'm like.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.142
Oh, good, you're awake.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.436
Can I ask you a question
about where we're going?

01:43.812 --> 01:44.687
Sure.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.522
Where are we going? I forgot.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.484
We're going somewhere
that's not the Good Place

01:50.569 --> 01:52.194
and it's not the Bad Place.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.488
We're going to a Medium Place.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.825
Hm, is there a 7-Eleven on the way?

01:57.909 --> 01:59.577
Cos Janet's powers aren't working

01:59.661 --> 02:01.662
and I want some gum
and some football cards

02:01.747 --> 02:02.830
and some scratchy tickets.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.749
Go away from me.
- OK.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.301
Can this train go any faster, Janet?

02:15.594 --> 02:17.970
No pressure, but Jason and I
will literally be tortured

02:18.055 --> 02:19.639
for all of eternity if we get caught.

02:19.723 --> 02:23.059
Don't worry, there's no way to tell
we're going to Mindy St. Claire's house.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.769
It'll be our sexy little secret.

02:26.104 --> 02:27.480
Jason taught me about sexy things.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.315
Oh yeah?
What things did he say were sexy?

02:29.691 --> 02:32.068
Lamborghinis, cool snakes,
spinning rims

02:32.361 --> 02:36.405
20,000 followers on Instagram,
girls with pigtails eating lollipops

02:36.490 --> 02:39.825
latex pants, Carl's Jr. ads and sex.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.369
Hm. Some of those are right.

02:43.872 --> 02:47.166
I'm here to preside
over case number 00003

02:47.250 --> 02:49.126
regarding the soul of Eleanor Shellstrop.

02:49.211 --> 02:52.463
The Bad Place has sent Bad Janet
to present their argument.

02:53.298 --> 02:54.715
What up, dingdongs?

02:54.800 --> 02:57.635
Yeah, so basically, um,
the Fake Eleanor's a dirtbag

02:57.969 --> 03:01.347
and these jabronis are gonna try and claim
she's less of a dirtbag now

03:01.431 --> 03:06.894
but she just stole your train,
and she still sucks bad.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.813
And she belongs with us.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.022
Oh, also, check this out.

03:13.735 --> 03:14.860
Nailed it.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.988
I've ruled the fart inadmissible
as evidence.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.824
What I will consider
is the recent development

03:19.908 --> 03:21.200
of Eleanor stealing my train.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.368
Now, hold on a second.

03:22.452 --> 03:26.497
She stole your train
to voluntarily go down to the Bad Place.

03:26.581 --> 03:31.168
She was sacrificing herself
because she is a wonderful, selfless...

03:31.253 --> 03:32.294
No, don't... Oh.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.798
What's happening?
- I should have warned you.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.176
Shawn only cares about cold hard facts.

03:39.261 --> 03:42.888
If he detects any feelings in your voice,
he retreats into a cocoon

03:42.973 --> 03:45.433
so what we need to do now
is just be very still...

03:46.393 --> 03:47.768
...and very quiet.

03:55.694 --> 03:56.736
Finally!

03:56.862 --> 03:58.863
- Oh, come...
- What did he just say?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.364
Oh, because you're all so perfect.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.417
Wow.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.711
This is truly...

04:13.962 --> 04:14.837
Nothing.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.882
- So where does this Mindy St. Claire live?
- I don't know.

04:17.966 --> 04:21.427
I'm out of range of our neighbourhood.
I don't have any of my normal abilities here.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.553
Perfect.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.889
Well, let's try this way.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.435
Ooh, I've never had to walk before.
This is fun.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.857
Now I'm bored. Walking is dumb.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.158
Well, given that she's the only person
in the neighbourhood

04:44.242 --> 04:46.786
I'm guessing this is the pl...
Oh! She's naked!

04:48.371 --> 04:49.330
Oh, sorry!

04:53.293 --> 04:54.418
Who are you?

04:54.503 --> 04:55.544
I'm Janet.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.299
<i>Hello, Mindy. My name is Beadie.</i>

05:00.383 --> 05:01.509
<i>I'm from the Good Place</i>

05:01.593 --> 05:04.428
<i>and welcome to your first day
in the afterlife.</i>

05:04.513 --> 05:05.554
<i>What's up, idiots?</i>

05:05.639 --> 05:07.890
<i>Sorry I'm late, babe.
Hey, are you pregnant?</i>

05:08.600 --> 05:10.601
<i>- That's not possible.
- Congrats.</i>

05:10.685 --> 05:12.394
<i>Yeah, so, Mindy, look.</i>

05:12.479 --> 05:15.689
<i>You mostly sucked,
but then you did this one good thing.</i>

05:15.774 --> 05:17.274
<i>I mean, I still think we should get you...</i>

05:17.359 --> 05:19.527
<i>They didn't, but neither did we.</i>

05:20.195 --> 05:21.278
<i>A compromise was made:</i>

05:21.696 --> 05:23.781
<i>the neighbourhood you are in now
by yourself.</i>

05:24.241 --> 05:26.033
<i>You submitted
a list of things you wanted.</i>

05:26.117 --> 05:27.827
<i>The Good Place provided those things.</i>

05:27.911 --> 05:30.162
<i>Yeah, and the Bad Place
made some modifications.</i>

05:30.247 --> 05:33.290
<i>We got you your favourite beer.
- Yeah, but it's always warm.</i>

05:33.625 --> 05:36.752
<i>On your jukebox,
you'll find every song ever sung.</i>

05:36.837 --> 05:39.922
<i>Yeah, by The Eagles,
and it's only the live versions.</i>

05:40.257 --> 05:43.968
<i>Also, there's some spoken word poetry
from William Shatner.</i>

05:44.636 --> 05:46.470
<i>It's deeply terrible.</i>

05:46.555 --> 05:49.056
<i>You get the idea.
Welcome to eternal mediocrity.</i>

05:49.140 --> 05:51.267
<i>Welcome to the Medium Place.</i>

05:51.601 --> 05:54.353
<i>So what's up? What's your deal?
Are you single? What's going on?</i>

05:55.564 --> 05:57.022
Sorry about before.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.110
One of the perks of living alone
is that I get to just walk around naked.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.403
My kind of gal.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.197
And I gotta say, you keep it toight.

06:05.282 --> 06:09.618
Oh, that is the nicest and only thing
anyone has said to me in 30 years.

06:09.703 --> 06:13.831
So tell us everything.
I mean, what did you do to end up here?

06:13.915 --> 06:15.416
That's kind of a long story.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.167
You're gonna need a drink or three.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.879
Definitely my kind of gal.
- You guys have fun.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.213
This is me and Janet's honeymoon

06:21.298 --> 06:23.716
so we're gonna go try and figure out
how to have sex.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.929
So I was a hotshot corporate lawyer
in the 1980s.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.015
I only cared about making money
and doing cocaine.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.392
And I was pretty crappy to my family
as well.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.228
But, one night, I had an epiphany, right?

06:36.730 --> 06:38.564
I needed to do something good
with my life

06:38.648 --> 06:42.776
so I drew up plans for this foundation
that would help kids all over the world

06:42.861 --> 06:45.863
would advance human rights,
revolutionise agriculture

06:45.947 --> 06:49.909
and just improve every nation
and every society in every possible way.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.329
You were pretty coked up, huh?
- Oh, yeah, man. I was flying high.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.955
It was so awesome.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.958
But, you're not gonna believe this:
I followed through.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.085
Yeah, I woke up the next morning

07:00.170 --> 07:02.880
I went straight to the bank,
I withdrew my life savings

07:03.048 --> 07:04.632
and I was gonna start that charity.

07:04.716 --> 07:05.925
Good for you!

07:06.009 --> 07:08.510
And then I immediately fell
into subway tracks

07:08.595 --> 07:10.596
and was electrocuted by the third rail.
- Ooh.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.223
Honestly, not the type of rail
I thought was gonna kill me.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.851
Cos I love cocaine.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.063
Do you have any?
I'm just... I shouldn't... Do you?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.650
No.
- Oh, yeah.

07:22.734 --> 07:25.861
I mean, I was just... I was just kidding.
It was just a joke.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.656
I mean, who would want to do cocaine
right now?

07:36.164 --> 07:38.332
Are you OK?
- Anyway, so after I died

07:38.416 --> 07:40.084
uh, my sister found my plan

07:40.168 --> 07:45.339
and she used my money to start
the Mindy St. Claire Rescue Alliance, yeah.

07:45.757 --> 07:48.300
It's actually the largest relief aid charity
in the world.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.678
Oh, so the question was

07:51.221 --> 07:54.139
did you get credit
for all those good person points or not?

07:54.224 --> 07:55.099
Exactly.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.184
I don't know how long my case was pending
or whatever

07:57.560 --> 07:58.602
but when I woke up

07:58.687 --> 08:01.480
the two sides had been fighting about me
for a long time.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.359
Like a stripper
over that last bump of coke at the party

08:05.443 --> 08:07.236
if you know what I mean.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.531
But anyway, they finally came
to this compromise, you know?

08:10.615 --> 08:12.199
Well, it beats being tortured.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.576
- Mm.
- I was about to turn myself in.

08:14.869 --> 08:19.999
No. Yeah, there's no time
for that morality nonsense, sweetheart.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.166
This is about survival.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.918
You gotta look out for number one.

08:24.421 --> 08:28.424
Right, well, we don't have proof
that it doesn't cure Alzheimer's.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.468
Eleanor, we've got a surprise for you.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.971
Yeah, thanks, but I brought my own cake.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.807
Oh, I know you've only worked here
a few weeks

08:36.891 --> 08:39.768
but we have this little office tradition
where we all pitch in, and then we...

08:39.853 --> 08:42.688
Yeah, no, I get it.
It's just, I know what kind of cake I like.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.774
Plus, it's Lisa's birthday next week,
and if I let you give me a cake

08:45.859 --> 08:48.235
that means I gotta pitch in
to get Lisa a cake, and sing to her

08:48.319 --> 08:50.821
and wear one of those dumb hats
you all are wearing right now.

08:50.905 --> 08:51.780
No, thanks.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.658
This way, I don't owe you anything,
you don't owe me anything.

08:55.326 --> 08:56.368
Later.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.662
What were we talking about?

08:59.122 --> 09:01.498
What is her deal? Why is she like this?

09:01.583 --> 09:04.710
I don't know, but the meaner she is,
the more it turns me on.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.503
Is that weird?
- You're my boss.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.422
Oh, say that to me again

09:08.506 --> 09:10.507
but more disgusted with me,
like I'm a worm.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.512
Eleanor was supposed to be
in the Bad Place

09:15.597 --> 09:16.805
arrived here by accident

09:17.015 --> 09:19.600
assumed another person's identity
and has now escaped.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.019
Is that the whole story?

09:22.479 --> 09:26.190
Well, no.
Someone else was sent here by mistake.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.317
His name is Jason Mendoza

09:28.401 --> 09:30.360
and I believe he's on the train
with Eleanor.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.945
You knew about Jason?

09:32.030 --> 09:36.158
Yes, I know that he's a fake,
and that he's married to Janet

09:36.493 --> 09:38.243
and that this entire neighbourhood is...

09:38.787 --> 09:40.079
What's the human expression?

09:40.622 --> 09:43.373
Ah, yes, a smokin' hot turd.

09:43.792 --> 09:45.709
I will deal
with Jason Mendoza later.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.252
For now, I will hear your arguments

09:47.337 --> 09:50.130
for why Fake Eleanor Shellstrop
should stay in the Good Place.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.550
We can do this,
but we must remain emotionless.

09:53.635 --> 09:56.845
I'm talking Kristen Stewart
on a red carpet level of emotionless here

09:56.930 --> 09:57.971
all right?

09:58.973 --> 09:59.848
Begin.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.060
Eleanor dedicated herself
to the study of ethics.

10:03.144 --> 10:05.479
I was blown away by her capacity
for self-improvement.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.189
Eleanor is a magnificent person

10:07.273 --> 10:08.899
who has grown tremendously
in her time here.

10:08.983 --> 10:10.859
Please, I'm begging you. Please.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.320
Voluntarily heading to the Bad Place

10:13.404 --> 10:15.405
proves that she is a selfless person.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.659
Sorry. I'm getting choked up.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.371
Yes, voluntarily sacrificing herself

10:22.455 --> 10:25.040
and heading to the Bad Place
would be a point in her favour.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.543
However, I've just received word
that Eleanor is not currently

10:27.627 --> 10:28.669
in the Bad Place.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.295
We have no idea where she is.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.047
Well, what the fork!
- What?

10:36.219 --> 10:37.970
I will now review Eleanor's memories.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.806
Her memories?
As in, all the things she's done on Earth?

10:40.890 --> 10:43.433
Mm-hm.
- Perhaps we could take a little break first.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.936
You know, we've been at it for a while,
and you must be tired.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.522
I've been asleep in goo
for the last 29 years, so I'm good.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.024
Call up the screen
for Fake Eleanor Shellstrop, please.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.404
Where should we begin,
"Waiters Screamed At"

10:55.488 --> 10:57.990
or "Cyberbullying of Pregnant Woman
from Spin Class"?

11:05.290 --> 11:07.416
Hey, you wanna grab a drink or something?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.711
Uh, no, I kind of have
my own private time routine.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.255
I thought you'd want company
after being here alone for so long.

11:14.132 --> 11:16.008
No.
- OK, I get it.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.218
Hey, uh, where did you get that?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.262
That's not one of my books.

11:20.346 --> 11:23.015
I only have Anne Rice vampire novels
with water stains

11:23.099 --> 11:25.475
and I've cut words out of most of them
to make pornography.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.729
My friend in the Good Place gave it to me
when he was teaching me ethics.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.147
It reminds me of him.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.942
Look, if you wanna survive,
you have to forget what you left behind.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.111
Take that whole experience,
crumple it up

11:36.779 --> 11:37.988
throw it in the garbage can.

11:40.283 --> 11:41.325
OK.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.367
Instead of reading

11:42.452 --> 11:46.997
I will watch
<i>this VHS copy of Cannonball Run II.</i>

11:47.415 --> 11:51.543
Or maybe
<i>The Making of Cannonball Run II.</i>

11:51.961 --> 11:53.795
Wow. Very medium.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.130
Yeah.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.925
Hey, you two lovebirds
figure out how to have sex yet?

11:58.176 --> 11:59.760
No. We tried for two hours

11:59.844 --> 12:02.429
but there was just a lot of,
like, bumping into each other.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.764
It was weird.

12:06.893 --> 12:11.355
<i>Quiero agradecerles
a mis padres por este día tan especial y...</i>

12:13.441 --> 12:15.359
This ain't your bar mitzvah anymore, bitch.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.612
It's my 24th birthday! What!

12:18.863 --> 12:20.113
Hot tiara, girl.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.575
That was "The Crashing
and Subsequent Destruction

12:23.660 --> 12:25.494
of Vanessa Garcia's Quinceañera ".

12:25.620 --> 12:26.954
Let's move on to another event.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.374
"Heckling of Mall Santas"?

12:30.708 --> 12:33.877
"Lifetime Ban from Build-a-Bear Workshop"?

12:33.962 --> 12:37.714
"Brief Instagram Flirtation with Kid Rock"?
Oh no.

12:37.799 --> 12:40.425
This is getting away from us.
We need to do something quickly.

12:41.219 --> 12:45.097
Yeah, uh... Uh, Judge, request permission
to speak somewhat emotionally?

12:45.181 --> 12:46.431
Ugh. Fine.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.310
Dramamine. Helps with the nausea. Proceed.

12:50.853 --> 12:54.481
Look, I know, obviously,
these memories aren't great.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.985
I was particularly disturbed
by "Started Fire in Mailbox

12:58.069 --> 12:59.987
to Get Mailman to Take Off Shirt"

13:00.071 --> 13:01.530
but that was the old Eleanor.

13:01.864 --> 13:02.906
She changed.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.243
She worked, and she studied
and she got better.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.870
And it wasn't just self-preservation.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.747
It was real self-improvement.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.293
I made the decision to help Eleanor
that first week, and I'm glad I did.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.461
Because she's worth it.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.547
I, too, helped Eleanor.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.966
Not as much as Chidi, surely

13:21.050 --> 13:24.636
but my help was more friendship
and sorely needed fashion advice.

13:25.513 --> 13:26.888
Eleanor deserves to stay.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.808
Thank you for these testimonials.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.435
A ruling has been reached.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.607
Oh, you want to hear it.

13:37.692 --> 13:40.235
I forgot how needy humans are.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.696
Eleanor Shellstrop is a bad person.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.741
The progress she has made
does not offset her actions on Earth.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.201
She deserves to be in the Bad Place.
- Oh.

13:48.703 --> 13:49.995
As concerning Jason Mendoza

13:50.079 --> 13:52.789
I have heard no statements
nor seen any evidence to suggest...

13:52.874 --> 13:54.583
Oh, he's from Florida?

13:55.501 --> 13:57.085
Yeah, he belongs in the Bad Place.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.755
No, but, how do you intend
to enforce this ruling?

13:59.839 --> 14:01.340
You have no idea where they are.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.133
Bad Janet?

14:03.301 --> 14:04.718
What's up, forknuts?

14:05.094 --> 14:06.595
Engage walkie-talkie protocol.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.101
What if you're here and I'm like this?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.270
Yes, that may work.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.858
Whoa, what is happening?

14:19.942 --> 14:22.235
Is she having an orgasm?
Did I do it somehow?

14:22.320 --> 14:24.905
<i>Attention Eleanor Shellstrop
and Jason Mendoza.</i>

14:24.989 --> 14:27.741
This is the Almighty Judge on High
of all beings, living and dead

14:27.825 --> 14:28.784
for all eternity.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.743
My name's Shawn.

14:30.411 --> 14:31.536
<i>We do not know where you are</i>

14:31.621 --> 14:33.205
<i>but hope you are receiving
this message.</i>

14:33.623 --> 14:35.916
<i>You have been found to be
the rightful property of the Bad Place.</i>

14:36.000 --> 14:37.793
<i>Either return
to your original neighbourhood</i>

14:37.877 --> 14:41.129
<i>or your accomplices,
Chidi Anagonye and Tahani Al-Jamil</i>

14:41.214 --> 14:42.589
will go to the Bad Place in your stead.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.799
What?
- What?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.967
You have four hours. Goodbye.

14:46.427 --> 14:50.055
Your Honour, please,
Chidi and Tahani are completely innocent.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.515
They are not completely innocent.

14:51.599 --> 14:52.891
They told me so themselves.

14:52.975 --> 14:56.895
They aided and abetted two criminals,
one of whom, was a DJ.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.649
They're gonna send Chidi and Tahani
to the Bad Place?

15:02.151 --> 15:04.277
We're off the hook. This is amazing!

15:04.362 --> 15:07.656
Babe, we are going to be trying
to make love all night long.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.374
We don't have to go back, though.
They just said.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.960
We can't let Tahani and Chidi
go to the Bad Place.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.169
They're our friends.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.630
We literally owe it to them.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.674
If they're really our friends,

15:25.758 --> 15:28.260
then why aren't they here with us right now?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.637
Because we ran away. Are you...?

15:31.514 --> 15:35.851
Does your brain work, actually?
Do you have a functioning head?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.269
I think he has a good point.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.229
I wouldn't go back for those turkeys.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.815
How can you say that?
- Think practically here.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.484
OK, you go back,
you turn yourself in

15:44.569 --> 15:47.279
you get sent to the Bad Place,
and you never see your friends again.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.866
Or you stay here,
you're safe from the Bad Place

15:51.117 --> 15:52.617
and you never see your friends again.

15:52.952 --> 15:53.827
It's the same results

15:54.078 --> 15:56.121
except if you stay here,
you don't get tortured.

15:56.205 --> 15:58.498
But they do.
- That's their problem.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.501
Your problem is whether you get tortured.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.378
Now if you'll excuse me...

16:04.172 --> 16:05.464
it's my masturbating time.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.883
When isn't it? We're going back.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.676
But--
- Now.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.473
Can we even make it there in time?

16:14.557 --> 16:16.683
I believe so, though it'll be close.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.101
- Where's Jason?
- Heads up!

16:18.186 --> 16:19.936
Sorry, Eleanor,
but I can't let us leave.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.397
Bortles!

16:24.400 --> 16:25.484
No!

16:29.322 --> 16:30.989
What are you doing, you goon?

16:31.073 --> 16:32.282
Trying to blow up the train.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.784
Blowing stuff up
got me out of so many jams on Earth.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.037
Let me try again.
Do... Do you have another bottle?

16:38.831 --> 16:41.583
Hi there,
since there's no Janet here to serve you

16:41.667 --> 16:43.168
I brought you two a little treat.

16:43.461 --> 16:46.546
Ah, kind of like a last meal.
- Not like a last meal

16:47.131 --> 16:49.799
just, uh, the final food
you might ever eat.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.679
I'm gonna miss these little perks
when I'm down in the Bad Place

16:55.306 --> 16:56.389
being forced to wear a...

16:56.766 --> 16:59.351
A knock-off handbag and drink tap water.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.604
That's what you think hell is?
- Ugh.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.106
Janet, please, we have to go.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.484
I won't start the train
until my husband says it's OK.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.112
I'm sorry, Eleanor,
but I engaged a Ride or Die protocol

17:11.197 --> 17:13.073
so I'm loyal to Jason forever.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.159
Buddy...

17:17.537 --> 17:18.912
Come on, we gotta go.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.414
I don't wanna go to the Bad Place.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.750
It's scary, like the movie Ratatouille.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.877
What?
- Yo, I ain't trying to have rats

17:25.962 --> 17:28.797
living in my hat and pulling my hair
to get me to do stuff.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.174
I'm scared too

17:32.134 --> 17:35.303
but we can't just abandon our friends
and let them take the fall for us.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.390
Sure we can.
It would be so easy to do that.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.475
We'd just go back to Mindy's house,
chill out...

17:40.560 --> 17:42.269
I'd get used to room-temperature beer.

17:42.353 --> 17:45.063
Me and Janet keep trying to solve
the problem of how to have sex

17:45.439 --> 17:46.731
which could take years.

17:47.275 --> 17:50.610
Let's just pretend that we didn't hear
the Janet walkie-talkie message.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.448
No. It's time to own up, dude.

17:55.533 --> 17:59.244
I spent my whole life acting like Mindy -
me first, no matter what

17:59.620 --> 18:01.663
and it literally took dying

18:01.914 --> 18:06.167
and being around a bunch of good people
to realise that I was kind of a nightmare.

18:06.502 --> 18:08.712
- Why were you like that?
- Well...

18:09.171 --> 18:11.798
let me tell you about
Doug and Donna Shellstrop.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.719
Hey, Dad, just a warning,
Mom's gonna be here in a second.

18:16.012 --> 18:19.306
Ugh, your mother's coming?
Oh, boy, hide the silverware.

18:19.390 --> 18:21.057
You mean the silverware
you stole from mom?

18:21.142 --> 18:23.018
Yeah, but she keeps trying
to steal it back.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.145
I drove here as fast as I could.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.439
You scored free WrestleMania tickets?

18:27.523 --> 18:28.481
There are no tickets, Mom.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.317
I knew that was the only way
I could get you here.

18:30.401 --> 18:31.985
A-ha! Burn.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.946
Eleanor, just because your father and I
are divorced

18:35.031 --> 18:37.324
does not mean
you can disrespect me like this, OK?

18:37.408 --> 18:38.825
We are a family.

18:39.744 --> 18:41.286
Whose birthday is it?
- Mine.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.330
Are you serious? No way!

18:43.706 --> 18:45.874
There was a B.S. foul on Chapman.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.751
And since you both forgot, again

18:47.835 --> 18:50.378
which means you definitely
didn't get me a present, again

18:50.671 --> 18:51.713
I got myself something.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.340
I just need you to sign it.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.426
Emancipation papers? Honey!

18:56.969 --> 18:58.720
What does "emancipation" mean?

18:58.804 --> 19:00.597
It means I'll be on my own.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.059
All my life, I've been taking care
of myself and you guys.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.811
I work two after-school jobs
because you blew half my college fund

19:06.896 --> 19:08.229
bailing your boyfriend out of jail.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.481
So irresponsible.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.775
And you blew the other half
trying to frame her boyfriend.

19:11.859 --> 19:15.487
It was so stupid.
He was already guilty, dumbass.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.405
I've been on my own
for a while now anyway

19:17.740 --> 19:19.949
and after you sign these papers,
it'll be official.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.577
I won't owe you anything,
you won't owe me anything.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.830
Well, if you want me to sign...
Oh, that's a joint.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.957
Uh, do you have a pen... or a lighter?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.836
You're a really interesting person,
Eleanor.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.546
We should hang out sometime.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.264
Wow, your parents sucked.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.641
Yeah, they did

19:45.559 --> 19:47.435
and I've been using their crappy parenting

19:47.520 --> 19:49.979
as an excuse for my selfish behaviour
all my life.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.190
No more.

19:52.983 --> 19:54.192
We know what's right here.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.944
We have to go back.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.117
Ride or die.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.880
Time is up. In preparation for your trip
to the Bad Place

20:15.965 --> 20:17.215
please put on these fedoras.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.883
Oh no.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.678
Well, no use delaying the inevitable.

20:22.888 --> 20:23.930
We surrender.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.432
Together.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.727
Chidi, Tahani,
we're back to save your souls!

20:31.897 --> 20:33.231
Real weird vibe in here.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.234
Was definitely expecting some applause.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.654
You're too late.
You... You missed the cut-off.

20:40.281 --> 20:41.322
But we're here.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.992
We came here as fast as we could,
and we're here.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.118
So...

20:46.454 --> 20:47.495
now what?

20:51.500 --> 20:53.626
What is the most logical decision?

20:54.879 --> 20:55.962
I made my initial ruling.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.757
I established a deadline.
The deadline was missed.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.592
Now the original perpetrators are here.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.011
Ugh, this is exhausting.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.847
I just want to go back
to my container of goo and go to sleep.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.016
The Bad Place is owed two people.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.102
In my opinion,
which is an objective fact in this case

21:11.187 --> 21:12.562
and all cases always and forever

21:12.646 --> 21:15.523
you have all done bad things
since you arrived here.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.817
