<i>Itself.</i>

00:04.180 --> 00:05.514
Now!

00:05.580 --> 00:07.849
Let's get
what we came here for.

00:07.917 --> 00:12.420
<i>I believe those symbols may imply</i>
<i>there are other ways out of here.</i>

00:12.488 --> 00:13.955
<i>You must kill the horse</i>

00:14.023 --> 00:15.957
<i>before it</i>
<i>snaps your neck.</i>

00:17.059 --> 00:18.927
<i>Ferrante.</i>
No more games!

00:18.995 --> 00:21.096
Have faith
that my plans proceed.

00:21.164 --> 00:23.198
I intend to take
my rightful place.

00:23.266 --> 00:25.433
The Sword of Osman.
It cannot be.

00:25.501 --> 00:26.935
And what is it
you want in return?

00:27.003 --> 00:28.503
To bring you to Rome.

00:28.571 --> 00:30.839
I am about to embark on a journey
to the den of my sworn enemy.

00:30.907 --> 00:32.473
Don't speak
to me of risk.

00:32.542 --> 00:34.176
This is not
what we agreed upon.

00:34.243 --> 00:36.444
You entered the vault
without me by your side.

00:36.512 --> 00:37.846
There's someone here.

00:40.283 --> 00:41.750
Leonardo!

00:41.817 --> 00:44.786
No! That's my mother!

00:44.854 --> 00:46.087
No!

<i>Did you ever</i>
<i>think we'd see the end together?</i>

02:04.867 --> 02:09.770
<i>I never thought that</i>
<i>I'd be facing an end at all.</i>

02:09.838 --> 02:12.940
God is laughing
at us, Da Vinci.

02:14.543 --> 02:17.912
This is not our fate.

02:26.388 --> 02:30.825
One way or another,
this is every man's fate.

02:32.728 --> 02:37.765
Our lives are made
by the deaths of others.

02:37.833 --> 02:40.601
You are very quick
to surrender.

02:40.669 --> 02:43.638
After all we've seen?

02:43.705 --> 02:45.506
Lost?

02:49.344 --> 02:51.679
Perhaps you are naive
to endure.

02:51.747 --> 02:53.514
<i>That's all</i>
<i>I've ever known.</i>

02:56.285 --> 02:58.386
I was born a bastard.

03:03.292 --> 03:06.694
I was raised
in a monastery.

03:06.762 --> 03:09.363
Abandoned at birth.

03:10.933 --> 03:13.835
Did you know that?

03:13.902 --> 03:15.770
No.

03:15.838 --> 03:19.941
The Holy Father appeared

03:20.008 --> 03:25.279
and he asked me to be
the sword of the Church.

03:30.185 --> 03:34.388
To strike out its enemies
wherever they were to be found.

03:40.295 --> 03:44.765
He asked me to do...

03:44.833 --> 03:47.101
terrible things.

03:56.612 --> 03:59.380
This is where faith
has carried me.

04:15.631 --> 04:16.964
Florence,
it is withering.

04:17.031 --> 04:21.935
My wife grows dependent on
my grandfather's bastard.

04:22.004 --> 04:24.805
Do you fear Carlo seeks
to turn your absence to his favor?

04:24.873 --> 04:27.541
The timing of his arrival
is telling.

04:27.609 --> 04:30.144
Giuliano is dead and I am
endlessly forestalled here.

04:30.212 --> 04:32.480
Could Clarice
be so easily swayed?

04:32.547 --> 04:35.216
She has never
lacked resolve.

04:35.284 --> 04:38.552
But she has also never
endured a hardship like this.

04:38.620 --> 04:42.757
I would never break faith with you
had I the honor of her position.

04:53.468 --> 04:55.569
There was a time...

04:55.604 --> 04:59.240
There was a time
I was certain that...

04:59.308 --> 05:03.177
no other woman
would claim that role...

05:04.513 --> 05:07.515
save you.

05:07.582 --> 05:10.451
We were all of us pawns.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.787
Married young, in
the service of alliances

05:12.854 --> 05:15.456
that have since
evaporated.

05:15.524 --> 05:20.227
What is there to stop us
from declaring our hearts now?

05:20.295 --> 05:24.699
I'd rather escape and live
as an anonymous citizen

05:24.766 --> 05:26.100
than be Alfonso's queen.

05:26.168 --> 05:28.469
And I would hope to
do that with you.

05:41.149 --> 05:45.453
To what end do we
sacrifice our happiness?

05:45.520 --> 05:48.756
Our lives
are not our own.

05:48.824 --> 05:51.726
If Naples is your only hope,
then Florence is already lost.

05:51.793 --> 05:53.728
Ferrante's deranged.

05:53.795 --> 05:55.730
Distracted by his
bizarre recreations.

05:55.797 --> 05:58.366
Why not choose
a different life?

05:58.433 --> 06:02.036
I've already dispatched Piero to meet
with the Neapolitan nobility.

06:02.104 --> 06:04.705
If Ferrate discovers you're
attempting to buy influence?

06:04.773 --> 06:05.773
What will he do?

06:05.841 --> 06:08.275
Throw me back
in prison?

06:11.880 --> 06:15.416
I have to do this.

06:15.484 --> 06:18.619
I must fight
for what I hold dear.

06:18.687 --> 06:21.088
As must I.

06:26.294 --> 06:28.362
<i>Tuscan towns</i>
<i>fall with ease.</i>

06:28.430 --> 06:30.064
<i>Trade has ceased.</i>

06:30.132 --> 06:32.700
<i>Florence stands alone.</i>

06:32.768 --> 06:34.135
Excellent.

06:34.202 --> 06:38.606
Without God's favor
and without their leader,

06:38.673 --> 06:41.575
their walls
will not stand for long.

06:41.643 --> 06:44.412
<i>About their leader,</i>
<i>Your Holiness...</i>

06:44.479 --> 06:47.081
Lorenzo lives.

06:53.221 --> 06:54.655
Leave.

06:58.093 --> 07:01.529
In time, I fear he will
negotiate with my father,

07:01.596 --> 07:04.165
unraveling all
you and I have built.

07:04.232 --> 07:08.302
Ferrante plays games while
the world awaits action.

07:13.542 --> 07:17.778
Duke Federico
surrounds Florence.

07:17.846 --> 07:23.084
It is not the course I planned
but perhaps it is time to strike.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.157
My dreamer...

07:32.727 --> 07:36.197
Understand,

07:36.264 --> 07:37.932
this brings me no joy.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.600
What of my mother?

07:42.170 --> 07:43.504
Have you found her?

07:43.572 --> 07:45.206
No.

07:45.273 --> 07:47.108
Nor the book.

07:47.175 --> 07:50.444
We still have to solve
that last mystery of the vault.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.279
I can help you.

07:52.347 --> 07:56.617
My visions foretell your deaths
will please our gods.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.553
And they will reward us
with the Book of Leaves.

07:59.621 --> 08:01.755
Oh, well, that sounds nice.

08:01.823 --> 08:06.026
I will hold this
as a treasure from you.

08:06.094 --> 08:11.432
As you meet the gods
bearing a treasure from me.

08:16.138 --> 08:19.907
I ask only that you spare
the life of my companions,

08:19.975 --> 08:23.177
Zoroaster and Nico.

08:23.245 --> 08:27.014
Topa Inca has declared them
unfit for sacrifice.

08:27.082 --> 08:30.885
They will spend
their days in servitude.

08:30.952 --> 08:31.919
Show me.

08:59.514 --> 09:03.517
Your friends are safe.
Good.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.352
Don't worry about me.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.722
Just remember that you're a shovelful
of sun-laden camel snot.

09:10.792 --> 09:13.194
Thank you.

09:20.569 --> 09:23.704
What did the Maestro mean?
Why didn't he fight?

09:23.772 --> 09:24.872
He had no choice.

09:27.642 --> 09:30.844
It's that phrase. I know
I've heard it before.

09:30.912 --> 09:32.279
What does it matter?

09:32.347 --> 09:36.350
Yeah, years ago, Leo and I were in
this tavern outside Forli.

09:36.418 --> 09:39.386
I complimented the curvature of the
tavern owner's wife.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.888
Big tits didn't take
kindly to it,

09:40.956 --> 09:42.690
called me a shovelful
of sun-laden camel...

09:45.126 --> 09:48.963
It was a message.

09:49.030 --> 09:50.197
Leo...

09:50.265 --> 09:52.366
He wants us to
get out of here.

09:54.402 --> 09:55.736
Without him?

09:55.804 --> 09:59.473
What about the guard?

09:59.541 --> 10:01.542
Why don't you
watch and learn?

10:15.257 --> 10:18.626
Guard, he's trying
to escape. Get him!

10:18.693 --> 10:22.129
No, no.

10:24.032 --> 10:27.534
What the fuck did Riario
do to you on that ship?

10:43.018 --> 10:45.419
He taught me
to survive.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.229
Thank you for your time,
Signor.

11:02.837 --> 11:06.418
Ah, thank you for coming
to see me, Signor Campano.

11:06.443 --> 11:08.175
Please.

11:08.176 --> 11:10.611
I see Ferrante has finally
allowed his guests

11:10.679 --> 11:12.546
to enjoy the finer
side of Naples.

11:12.614 --> 11:15.649
Where is Il Magnifico?

11:15.717 --> 11:17.885
Recuperating
from his triumph.

11:17.952 --> 11:21.021
And yet people whisper
that the King delays negotiation.

11:21.089 --> 11:24.858
Building an alliance
is a lengthy process.

11:24.926 --> 11:28.662
Ferrante is not easily
drawn away from his delights.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.698
At least not without
a word

11:30.765 --> 11:34.034
from those properly
positioned, like myself.

11:34.102 --> 11:36.470
It would be refreshing to
be honest about it all.

11:36.538 --> 11:41.575
Tell me, what is the price
of the word you offer?

11:49.284 --> 11:52.953
Messieurs,
might we have a word?

11:53.021 --> 11:55.089
This establishment
is private.

12:00.228 --> 12:03.097
Which of you two
gluttonous peacocks

12:03.164 --> 12:06.800
is the Florentine banker?

12:06.868 --> 12:10.037
He is. He works for
Lorenzo de Medici himself.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.775
Take them.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.114
Fucking Frenchman!

12:20.181 --> 12:22.629
For all Ferrante's military might,

12:22.654 --> 12:25.122
he couldn't keep
band of pirates at bay.

12:25.520 --> 12:28.255
Ozzo's been savvy enough to
escape Ferrante's wrath.

12:28.323 --> 12:31.158
For months now he and his men
have stolen from the royal fleet

12:31.226 --> 12:33.594
and then ransomed
the cargo back at twice the cost.

12:33.661 --> 12:35.963
I lack resources here
to buy their freedom.

12:36.030 --> 12:39.967
Florence is surrounded and
all the funds I carried

12:40.034 --> 12:42.069
have been paid in bribes.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.171
You cannot turn to Ferrante
in this matter.

12:44.239 --> 12:48.008
His own advisor was apprehended
with Piero.

12:48.076 --> 12:50.043
Surely the King
would provide a loan.

12:50.111 --> 12:55.783
If he sees you as weak,
he will never grant your alliance.

12:55.850 --> 12:57.084
But...

12:57.152 --> 12:59.486
if you best Ozzo,

12:59.554 --> 13:03.891
you may yet gain
Ferrante's favor.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.399
Holy Father, my apologies.

13:12.467 --> 13:14.868
What do you want, Rodrigo?

13:14.936 --> 13:19.973
A most unusual visitor
has arrived requesting an audience.

13:33.221 --> 13:35.856
It appears the world
has come calling.

14:10.625 --> 14:14.361
We both wanted
to see what's next.

14:14.429 --> 14:15.762
There's still time.

14:15.830 --> 14:18.765
We have failed, artista.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.901
You should accept this.
Never.

14:29.844 --> 14:33.881
You heard my
mother's voice yourself.

14:33.948 --> 14:36.283
I once believed I heard
the voice of God.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.122
The mind plays
shameful tricks

14:42.190 --> 14:44.525
when we want
something too much.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.761
Would you let anything
stand in your way

14:47.829 --> 14:51.598
if it were possible that your mother
was inside the vault?

14:51.666 --> 14:54.568
Or Zita?

14:57.972 --> 15:00.073
Just be ready.

15:21.229 --> 15:22.930
Now Pachamama
shall drink your blood

15:22.997 --> 15:26.400
and grant me the power
to save my people.

15:29.904 --> 15:31.138
Right, so what
are we looking for?

15:31.205 --> 15:33.473
The fat we've scraped
off those bloody bones.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.909
They can't have
carried it far.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.312
Why do we care
about that?

15:38.379 --> 15:40.013
The owner of the
tavern outside Forli,

15:40.081 --> 15:41.782
he and his cronies
had us surrounded

15:41.849 --> 15:42.950
but I came up with
the bright idea

15:43.017 --> 15:44.657
to launch a pan of pork
fat into the fire.

15:44.686 --> 15:47.287
What? The distraction
worked believe it or not.

15:47.355 --> 15:50.123
I escaped.
Leo wasn't so lucky.

15:50.191 --> 15:52.526
The wart-faced owner
gave him a beating reserved for me.

15:52.594 --> 15:56.330
He wants us to save ourselves
using a similar diversion.

15:58.066 --> 15:59.366
What about the Maestro?

15:59.434 --> 16:02.235
He said not to
worry about him.

16:02.303 --> 16:06.139
But this time I'll make sure
the distraction works for all of us.

16:39.774 --> 16:41.975
Wait for me
in the next life, Leonardo.

16:56.190 --> 16:59.559
The Book of Leaves
will save my people.

17:15.676 --> 17:18.478
There's no escaping the wrath
of the Sky Gods, Leonardo.

17:18.546 --> 17:22.415
Translate all I say.

17:22.483 --> 17:24.384
Children of the sun!

17:26.688 --> 17:28.387
My companions and I,

17:28.455 --> 17:31.358
we have faced the trials
of the divine

17:31.426 --> 17:33.293
and survived.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.236
Let us return to
the vault freely

17:43.304 --> 17:48.909
and you may be spared
the gods' vengeance.

17:52.914 --> 17:53.914
This is your plan?

17:53.981 --> 17:56.149
It's a bit fluid.

18:17.672 --> 18:19.473
Lay down your blade,
Leonardo.

18:19.540 --> 18:24.277
If I can't find my mother,
what else do I have?

18:24.345 --> 18:25.746
What else do I...

18:29.751 --> 18:30.951
Run!

18:47.969 --> 18:49.336
Bishop of Rome,

18:49.403 --> 18:51.471
I present myself to you.

18:51.539 --> 18:53.540
Bayezid the Second.

18:53.608 --> 18:56.243
Eldest son of Sultan Mehmed
the Conqueror

18:56.310 --> 18:59.246
and heir to the throne of
the great Ottoman Empire.

18:59.313 --> 19:01.515
Hold.

19:07.255 --> 19:10.023
Why are you here,
son of the Sultan?

19:10.091 --> 19:14.594
I have come
at your invitation.

19:14.662 --> 19:18.365
My invitation?

19:18.432 --> 19:22.169
Your father's empire
plagues our shores.

19:22.236 --> 19:24.171
Yet your emissaries
urged me here

19:24.238 --> 19:27.007
to discuss a proposal
for a mutually beneficial peace.

19:27.074 --> 19:28.275
I sent no emissaries.

19:28.342 --> 19:29.976
He comes on
false pretenses

19:30.044 --> 19:34.648
simply to get close
enough to strike.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.650
Perhaps we should
speak in private.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.885
I have no words for you.

19:41.989 --> 19:46.259
This man was one of two
who came bearing the Sword of Osman

19:46.327 --> 19:48.228
as proof of
your endorsement.

19:48.296 --> 19:52.032
Why grant me such a prize if you had
no intention of discussing peace?

19:52.099 --> 19:53.533
Apprehend that man.

19:59.674 --> 20:03.643
I've never seen
this Mongol in my life.

20:03.711 --> 20:06.046
Cardinal,

20:06.113 --> 20:10.417
make your way
to the Archives.

20:10.484 --> 20:12.419
If the sword
is indeed missing,

20:12.486 --> 20:16.590
then you come here
not only as infidels,

20:16.657 --> 20:19.159
you come here
as thieves.

20:24.498 --> 20:29.603
Leo, that was one shovelful of
sun-laden llama fat.

20:29.670 --> 20:31.504
We owe you our lives, Zo.
Now bring these.

20:31.572 --> 20:34.174
Easy to repay. Get me off this
fucking mountain.

20:36.310 --> 20:38.378
Leo, where are you going?

20:38.446 --> 20:39.946
We're escaping through
the Vault of Heaven.

20:40.014 --> 20:41.815
Are you out of your mind?

20:41.883 --> 20:43.250
We cannot outrun them.
These are their lands.

20:43.317 --> 20:45.619
We must resort
to the unexpected.

20:45.686 --> 20:47.687
Bullshit!

20:47.755 --> 20:49.789
Maestro, when we get in the
vault, how will we escape?

20:49.857 --> 20:52.225
I have a plan.
Of course he does.

20:52.293 --> 20:55.328
Go.
Up the fucking mountain.

20:58.299 --> 20:59.432
Be warned,

20:59.500 --> 21:03.336
I have men stationed
outside the city gates.

21:03.404 --> 21:06.740
If they do not receive word
from me within the hour,

21:06.807 --> 21:10.577
they will inform the Sultan
of my injury at your hands.

21:10.645 --> 21:13.980
That he allowed you to come here
perhaps demonstrates

21:14.048 --> 21:17.617
how little he values
your life...

21:17.685 --> 21:21.254
compared to
that of your brother Cem.

21:28.863 --> 21:31.364
What did you find,
Rodrigo?

21:31.432 --> 21:34.334
The Sword of Osman is gone,
Holy Father.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.207
From whom
did you acquire the sword?

21:46.614 --> 21:49.916
Did these vermin send you?

21:49.984 --> 21:51.551
I sent no-one.

21:51.619 --> 21:54.321
There may be some
misunderstanding.

21:54.388 --> 21:56.990
But I come to make
a sincere overture

21:57.058 --> 22:00.193
to an accord
between our empires.

22:00.261 --> 22:02.295
Your father grows feeble
if he believes

22:02.363 --> 22:04.831
that we would seek
peace with heathens.

22:04.899 --> 22:07.434
Indeed. Mehmed the Conqueror

22:07.501 --> 22:11.304
would never entertain such
an improbability.

22:13.074 --> 22:16.876
Which is why...

22:16.944 --> 22:21.114
an ambitious
and overlooked son

22:21.182 --> 22:22.482
might commence
this mission

22:22.550 --> 22:27.120
without
the Sultan's knowledge.

22:31.525 --> 22:36.963
You came here
expecting peace?

22:37.031 --> 22:40.800
I came here
with the hope of peace.

22:40.868 --> 22:45.472
Your dream of diplomacy
is entertaining.

22:45.539 --> 22:48.641
Utterly misguided.

22:48.709 --> 22:51.578
Rid my house
of this filth.

22:53.214 --> 22:55.048
Spare only
the Sultan's son.

23:05.459 --> 23:06.860
Pity I can't kl you.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.428
I made no such promise.

23:36.357 --> 23:40.026
You disgrace me
by not taking my life.

23:40.094 --> 23:41.561
Strip him.

23:41.629 --> 23:44.097
Even of his boots.

23:44.165 --> 23:47.934
<i>Slay his horse and dump him outside</i>
<i>Rome's gates alone.</i>

23:50.538 --> 23:52.639
If he returns to Constantinople,
all the better.

23:52.706 --> 23:55.442
He will send
a clear message.

23:55.509 --> 23:58.812
Christendom
knows no boundaries.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.115
I hear I may have the pleasure
of exchanging words

24:35.182 --> 24:37.350
with an
Italian compatriot.

24:38.419 --> 24:40.086
Jacob Pasha.

24:40.154 --> 24:41.754
Adviser to the Sultan.

24:44.859 --> 24:46.292
You're a Christian.

24:47.761 --> 24:49.095
Not any more.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.532
I'm told your name
is Amelia Monleoni.

24:56.570 --> 24:58.938
It's a Florentine name.

24:59.006 --> 25:00.907
You know Florence?

25:00.975 --> 25:03.643
Before coming to serve
the Ottoman Empire,

25:03.711 --> 25:06.713
I visited Florence often
to revel in its...

25:06.780 --> 25:09.382
uninhibited society.

25:10.618 --> 25:13.453
They said you came
to see Bayezid.

25:13.521 --> 25:17.624
Was the matter urgent?
He certainly left without warning.

25:17.691 --> 25:20.960
It was personal.
Oh, I see.

25:24.064 --> 25:27.200
What business would
the son of the Sultan have

25:27.268 --> 25:29.302
with the prized mistress
of Lorenzo de Medici?

25:31.972 --> 25:33.973
<i>As I said,</i>
<i>I know Florence.</i>

25:34.041 --> 25:39.179
One does not forget a face
like yours, Signora Donati.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.747
Ah...

25:43.651 --> 25:46.753
I can't help but wonder
at your true purpose here.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.425
I'll hide no secrets
from you.

25:54.728 --> 25:56.296
Of course you will.

25:56.363 --> 25:59.699
It would be diverting
to hear your newest lies

25:59.767 --> 26:03.203
but...

26:03.270 --> 26:05.471
you underestimate us.

26:29.964 --> 26:33.600
We shall soon know the truth
without laying a hand upon you.

26:45.613 --> 26:49.649
I see you had no trouble
finding the place.

26:49.717 --> 26:51.884
I could smell it
a mile off.

26:51.952 --> 26:52.952
Stinking Frenchman.

26:55.422 --> 26:56.689
Get up!

26:56.757 --> 26:58.324
I said, get up!

27:05.332 --> 27:07.800
We brought your payment.

27:07.868 --> 27:10.370
Now release these men.

27:14.742 --> 27:17.644
Your sack is very small.

27:24.752 --> 27:27.387
And new facts
have come to light.

27:27.454 --> 27:31.057
My price is now double.

27:31.125 --> 27:33.526
We had an agreement.
It's criminal.

27:33.594 --> 27:37.997
I named the sum before I knew
that one of my hostages

27:38.065 --> 27:40.800
was the father of
the infamous Leonardo.

27:42.169 --> 27:45.004
You see, Mko here
had a brother.

27:45.072 --> 27:47.440
He once served
as a papal guard.

27:47.508 --> 27:48.908
Where is your brother now,
Mirko?

27:48.976 --> 27:53.980
Blown to bits by your
son's diabolical canon.

27:54.048 --> 27:56.482
Ozzo, wait.

27:56.550 --> 28:00.386
Good Duchess,
I cannot be trusted.

28:00.454 --> 28:03.923
You should have learned that from
my dealings with the King.

28:03.991 --> 28:05.024
Oh, I did.

28:17.404 --> 28:18.571
There is no need for this.

28:18.639 --> 28:20.940
That double-crossing
putain would have

28:21.008 --> 28:22.275
gladly lent you the money.

28:22.343 --> 28:23.976
Watch your words.
Why?

28:24.044 --> 28:28.314
She is the one who paid me
to kidnap your man in the first place!

28:28.382 --> 28:32.518
You... You planned this?

28:32.586 --> 28:36.389
More than mere bribes are needed
to impress my father-in-law.

28:36.457 --> 28:39.859
I sought to create
an opportunity.

28:43.230 --> 28:44.464
Now.

28:44.531 --> 28:48.668
Go ahead, Lorenzo.
Save your beloved Florence.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.577
Tell me again.

29:00.314 --> 29:01.814
Whose sack is small?

29:07.354 --> 29:08.287
Hurry up.

29:10.624 --> 29:11.624
Zo.

29:17.431 --> 29:19.499
Someone's been busy.
Destroyed the mechanism.

29:19.566 --> 29:21.167
It's a race to the vault.

29:21.235 --> 29:22.268
Unless we stop them
in their tracks.

29:22.336 --> 29:24.570
There's no time.
We have a head start.

29:53.167 --> 29:54.801
Right, Nico,
gather the supplies

29:54.868 --> 29:57.370
and cut the ropes into
lengths of eight paces.

29:57.438 --> 29:58.638
Go!

30:05.212 --> 30:07.252
You're locking us in?
I'm locking them out. Come on!

30:22.696 --> 30:24.664
This is a version of something
I designed a long time ago.

30:24.731 --> 30:28.601
It's a plan for ropes and cloths
to form miniature canopies

30:28.669 --> 30:31.003
that will allow an escape
from a great height.

30:31.071 --> 30:32.271
Have you ever tested it?

30:32.339 --> 30:34.874
The design's sound.
That's a no.

30:34.942 --> 30:38.044
We just cut the fabric
into this shape and then...

30:38.111 --> 30:40.012
Leo, come on,
we've got this.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.714
Go find your mother.

30:43.984 --> 30:45.318
Thank you.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.858
The Incas have clearly
made no progress.

30:51.925 --> 30:54.861
There must be a clue
somewhere.

31:01.935 --> 31:03.102
Leonardo!

31:03.904 --> 31:05.204
Mother!

31:08.242 --> 31:10.142
Tell me you heard that.
I did.

31:10.210 --> 31:13.946
Perhaps she and the book
lie in this vault.

31:14.014 --> 31:17.550
There has to be an anomaly
somewhere.

31:17.618 --> 31:20.186
The spheres.
These spheres!

31:20.254 --> 31:23.689
I remember that they have
magnetic properties and the vault is metal.

31:25.559 --> 31:29.962
Oh,
it doesn't do anything.

31:30.030 --> 31:31.297
Oh.
What?

31:31.365 --> 31:33.065
It only functions
under these two arches.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.206
Come on, come on.

31:41.241 --> 31:42.441
Any more?

31:45.312 --> 31:46.546
There must be
an arrangement.

31:53.220 --> 31:54.220
There must be a secret
to placing them.

31:54.288 --> 31:56.923
A combination,
an order of numbers.

31:56.990 --> 31:58.858
Will these riddles
never end?

32:00.627 --> 32:04.063
Wait, wait, wait.

32:04.131 --> 32:05.431
Wait.

32:07.601 --> 32:11.037
These arches,
I've seen them before.

32:14.942 --> 32:18.678
<i>The landscape</i>
<i>behind this woman...</i>

32:18.745 --> 32:20.713
<i>It's mysterious.</i>

32:20.781 --> 32:23.082
<i>Sort of riddle.</i>

32:27.721 --> 32:28.821
<i>I can solve this.</i>

32:32.526 --> 32:34.160
One, two, three.

32:35.862 --> 32:40.066
That vault
belongs to my people.

32:40.133 --> 32:44.337
You know what will happen
to us, to me, if you take it.

32:44.404 --> 32:46.172
Four, five, six.

32:46.239 --> 32:47.473
Seven.

33:09.196 --> 33:12.698
What is this?

33:12.766 --> 33:15.768
Where is she?

33:15.836 --> 33:17.336
Where is she?

33:19.139 --> 33:20.706
Where is she?

33:21.975 --> 33:23.242
This is where her voice
was coming from.

33:23.310 --> 33:27.380
It matters not.
The book is not here.

33:27.447 --> 33:29.115
This is the Lord's
cruelest joke.

33:38.191 --> 33:40.092
Leonardo...

33:43.964 --> 33:47.500
It speaks
with my mother's voice.

33:55.142 --> 33:56.909
Oh, that is astonishing.

33:56.977 --> 34:00.880
Why would someone craft
clockwork like this?

34:00.947 --> 34:04.884
Because this machine,

34:04.951 --> 34:09.188
it allows you to hear the
voice of someone who...

34:13.927 --> 34:15.795
Who is not here.

34:18.764 --> 34:22.435
It is a charlatan's toy.

34:22.502 --> 34:25.670
It is not the reason
you have come all this way.

34:25.739 --> 34:27.973
Where is the book?

34:28.041 --> 34:31.310
Where is the book?
Where is the book?!

34:35.282 --> 34:37.216
Where is
the fucking book?

34:41.455 --> 34:46.225
<i>Leonardo.</i>

34:46.293 --> 34:49.895
<i>Leonardo, my dearest.</i>
<i>I was betrayed.</i>

34:53.100 --> 34:58.738
<i>I could not keep</i>
<i>the Book of Leaves here.</i>

34:58.805 --> 35:00.906
<i>The only way you will</i>
<i>find its location...</i>

35:05.045 --> 35:08.914
<i>is if you give up</i>
<i>your quest for me.</i>

35:12.285 --> 35:13.486
<i>You must...</i>
<i>Leo!</i>

35:18.959 --> 35:19.992
We've got trouble.

35:20.060 --> 35:22.995
Nico!
<i>I'm almost done.</i>

35:23.063 --> 35:25.664
We must leave at once.
On this we agree!

35:28.535 --> 35:29.668
That one. That one.

35:29.736 --> 35:32.204
Just go to the one
nearest you.

35:32.272 --> 35:34.140
Grab the handles
as tight as you can,

35:34.207 --> 35:36.548
then gather the canopy into
a bundle

35:36.573 --> 35:39.193
and throw it high
in the air when you jump.

35:40.380 --> 35:42.081
I pray this works.

35:42.149 --> 35:43.517
Don't bother, Nico.

35:43.542 --> 35:45.542
If this is the end, let it
be ours to choose.

35:45.552 --> 35:48.220
Not the Lord's.

35:55.562 --> 35:56.962
I hate flying.

36:02.335 --> 36:04.170
Not a chance, beautiful!

36:05.305 --> 36:06.539
Please. Please.

36:06.606 --> 36:08.774
Please.

36:10.911 --> 36:12.745
Don't take the book
away from my people.

36:12.813 --> 36:14.180
Please.

36:16.550 --> 36:17.750
There was no book.

36:22.055 --> 36:24.056
Then we are doomed.

37:31.124 --> 37:35.160
I can't believe
we fucking did that.

37:37.764 --> 37:40.532
He's going to be easy
to find if he keeps up that noise.

37:49.175 --> 37:50.175
<i>Fuck!</i>

37:53.146 --> 37:55.247
Come on, he needs help!

37:55.315 --> 37:57.816
Easy, easy.

38:04.724 --> 38:06.592
Oh, shit.

38:06.660 --> 38:08.127
Right, we need to
set the bone.

38:10.196 --> 38:11.530
Put that in his mouth.

38:11.598 --> 38:13.465
Now hold him still.

38:16.002 --> 38:17.269
Ready?

38:19.472 --> 38:21.340
Go, go.
Come on.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.176
They'll know a way down.
We need to move.

38:24.244 --> 38:26.812
A litter will move him faster.
Let's just leave him.

38:26.880 --> 38:29.114
We are not doing that!
Having this fight again!

38:29.182 --> 38:32.351
He's coming with us!

38:32.419 --> 38:35.187
There's been enough death.

39:02.582 --> 39:03.816
My love,

39:03.883 --> 39:07.086
will you now grant yourself
a measure of happiness?

39:07.153 --> 39:10.055
As I said before,

39:10.123 --> 39:14.793
your joy must come first.

39:44.190 --> 39:46.825
Who is there?
<i>A message, Your Excellency.</i>

39:46.893 --> 39:49.962
Slide it under the door.

39:55.135 --> 39:56.201
What are you doing?

40:05.845 --> 40:08.213
What does it say?

40:08.281 --> 40:10.249
Well?

40:10.316 --> 40:13.552
What does it say?

40:13.620 --> 40:14.753
Come on.

40:19.592 --> 40:22.161
The King
will see you now.

40:26.766 --> 40:28.167
Move!

41:33.600 --> 41:35.567
The French pirate Ozzo.

41:35.635 --> 41:39.371
A thorn in my side
for too long.

41:39.439 --> 41:44.643
I thank you for this latest
addition to my collection.

41:44.711 --> 41:48.280
I've never seen a banker
so willing to get his hands dirty.

41:48.348 --> 41:51.550
Nor so able.

41:51.618 --> 41:53.919
I may deal in gold
and silver

41:53.987 --> 41:57.623
but I have my way
with steel as well.

41:57.690 --> 41:59.391
I thought you soft.

41:59.459 --> 42:03.195
Incapable of wielding
true power.

42:03.263 --> 42:06.632
But you used real force
to deal with this scofflaw.

42:06.699 --> 42:09.301
A sign of a true leader.

42:09.369 --> 42:11.537
Kind words indeed,
Your Grace.

42:11.604 --> 42:14.106
Approach, Magnifico.

42:19.779 --> 42:23.682
Allow me to show you
some of my secrets

42:23.750 --> 42:25.884
as the dawn of
a new friendship...

42:28.821 --> 42:30.389
Who dares?

42:32.525 --> 42:35.460
Alfonso,
you impudent infant.

42:35.528 --> 42:41.033
Father, consider your words
with such an honored guest in our midst.

42:45.271 --> 42:48.640
Lorenzo de Medici.

42:48.708 --> 42:51.476
Excellent to find you here
as Florence falls.

42:56.182 --> 42:58.884
What a priceless opportunity to
discuss your surrender.

43:14.234 --> 43:16.401
It's a shame.

43:16.469 --> 43:18.537
After all this.

43:18.605 --> 43:20.472
To not find your book.

43:20.540 --> 43:22.174
It's not a loss, Zo.

43:26.412 --> 43:28.680
This device...

43:28.748 --> 43:31.950
My mother's message.
It wasn't finished.

43:32.018 --> 43:35.320
She might still be alive.

43:41.461 --> 43:43.695
I'll retrieve the rest
of it by repairing it

43:43.763 --> 43:45.297
on our return
to Florence.

43:47.634 --> 43:49.901
Florence...

43:51.771 --> 43:53.238
You're mighty optimistic.

43:56.109 --> 43:58.043
Amerigo will return
with our ship.

43:58.111 --> 44:00.512
Just have a little faith.

44:00.580 --> 44:03.382
In that greasy
little nancy man?

44:03.449 --> 44:07.819
Maestro. He...
He wants to speak with you.

44:25.505 --> 44:28.807
I'm afraid I have
nothing to offer you

44:28.875 --> 44:30.475
that will dull
the pain.

44:32.045 --> 44:34.546
Your theoretical
generosity is touching.

44:54.767 --> 45:00.672
When His Holiness called me
to be his instrument,

45:00.740 --> 45:02.307
he tested my resolve.

45:05.645 --> 45:07.179
He...

45:12.285 --> 45:14.319
He sent me to exact vengeance
against a sinner

45:14.387 --> 45:16.688
who crossed our path.

45:29.702 --> 45:32.270
A Jewish prostitute.

45:32.338 --> 45:33.605
In God's holy city.

45:37.677 --> 45:39.511
<i>I followed her for hours.</i>

45:44.984 --> 45:48.854
I wanted so badly
to please my father.

45:51.324 --> 45:56.695
But how could the Lord
desire me to take a life?

46:01.801 --> 46:06.304
Sixtus chose her specifically.
Didn't he?

46:14.147 --> 46:17.282
Celia Lysimachus.

46:17.350 --> 46:22.521
You brought flowers
to her grave.

46:22.588 --> 46:24.423
She was um...

46:28.561 --> 46:31.163
someone familiar.

46:38.171 --> 46:40.005
She was your mother.

46:40.072 --> 46:43.508
We both grasped it
in those moments.

46:43.576 --> 46:47.446
And I...I didn't stop.

46:49.715 --> 46:54.152
I saw it in her eyes.
She knew who I was.

46:56.122 --> 46:58.356
And I only squeezed harder.

47:22.148 --> 47:25.584
<i>How foolish I have been...</i>

47:25.651 --> 47:29.488
<i>to follow the Book of Leaves</i>
<i>to the end of the world,</i>

47:29.555 --> 47:33.492
thinking it could absolve
me of my sins.

47:38.431 --> 47:43.001
Well, at least my father
was right on one account.

47:43.069 --> 47:46.471
It has all been
a path to ruin.

47:49.075 --> 47:54.312
No, it's
a fitting reward...

47:54.380 --> 47:57.549
I should go home so very
empty-handed.

48:02.989 --> 48:06.091
No.

48:06.158 --> 48:08.493
You've seen... You've seen
the Brazen Head.

48:13.099 --> 48:18.937
How could a device like
that be built without...

48:21.040 --> 48:24.309
without the knowledge
of the Book of Leaves.

48:24.377 --> 48:27.212
I never said the Book of Leaves
wasn't real, Da Vinci.

48:30.216 --> 48:32.584
But is it really worth it?

48:38.324 --> 48:40.592
<i>Leo, it's Amerigo!</i>

48:45.331 --> 48:46.932
For me...

48:58.144 --> 49:00.378
the quest is far from over.
