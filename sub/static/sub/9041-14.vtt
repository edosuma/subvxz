00:03.967 --> 00:05.200
UH-HUH.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.467
WELL, HAVE FUN IN CONNECTICUT,

00:06.467 --> 00:08.567
AND YOU DO WHAT GRANDMA
TELLS YOU, OKAY?

00:08.567 --> 00:12.200
- OR YOU'LL BE SENT BACK
TO THIS GRANDMA.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.667
- NO, NO, NO, HONEY.
HONEY, HE'S KIDDING.

00:14.667 --> 00:17.000
HE'S KIDDING.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
- OKAY, HONEY, WE LOVE YOU.
BYE-BYE.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.600
- BYE. BYE-BYE.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.467
- RAY,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN PACKED?

00:23.467 --> 00:25.133
AMY'S GONNA BE HERE
ANY SECOND.

00:25.133 --> 00:27.100
- - WHAT? I'M PACKED.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.067
- THAT'S IT?

00:32.067 --> 00:34.500
- WELL, ALL I NEED
IS MY GOLF CLOTHES.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.233
THE REST OF THE TIME,
I'M GONNA BE NAKED,

00:36.233 --> 00:39.333
LETTING YOUR EYES
ENJOY THE PARTY.

00:47.233 --> 00:49.700
- THERE BETTER BE BOOZE
AT THAT PARTY.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.133
AMY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

00:56.133 --> 00:58.667
- I'M GREAT.

00:58.667 --> 01:01.733
I'M ON MY WAY OVER HERE TO DRIVE
YOU GUYS TO THE AIRPORT

01:01.733 --> 01:03.533
FOR YOUR ROMANTIC GETAWAY.

01:03.533 --> 01:05.500
OF COURSE, I'M ABLE
TO DO THAT ON A FRIDAY NIGHT

01:05.500 --> 01:07.133
BECAUSE GIANNI
AND I BROKE UP.

01:07.133 --> 01:09.067
- OH, AMY, REALLY?

01:09.067 --> 01:11.633
- YEAH? OH, MAN.

01:11.633 --> 01:13.633
THAT'S TOUGH.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.733
SHOULD WE GET GOING?

01:18.500 --> 01:21.067
- HERE'S THE THING,
I KIND OF HAD TO ABANDON MY CAR

01:21.067 --> 01:22.467
IN THIS 50-FOOT SNOWDRIFT,

01:22.467 --> 01:24.300
THEN WALK 20 BLOCKS
TO GET HERE.

01:24.300 --> 01:25.800
I RUINED MY NEW SHOES.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.167
I GOT FROSTBITE
ON MY PINKY TOE,

01:27.167 --> 01:29.400
AND, OH, RIGHT BEFORE
MY CAR BATTERY DIED,

01:29.400 --> 01:31.233
THE GUY
ON THE RADIO SAID--

01:31.233 --> 01:32.967
HERE'S THE PART
YOU'LL CARE ABOUT--

01:32.967 --> 01:34.333
THE AIRPORT'S CLOSED.

01:34.333 --> 01:36.067
- OH, NO!
- OH, NO!

01:36.067 --> 01:38.633
- YES, SO I LOST MY CAR,
MY SHOES,

01:38.633 --> 01:41.067
NOT TO MENTION MY BOYFRIEND,
FOR NOTHING.

01:41.067 --> 01:44.300
AND I'LL DIE ALONE
WITH NINE TOES.

01:46.233 --> 01:47.700
- WHAT WAS THAT?

01:47.700 --> 01:50.133
- I THINK THE POWER
JUST WENT OUT.

01:50.133 --> 01:53.333
- MAN, YOU ARE NOTHING
BUT BAD NEWS TODAY.

01:58.367 --> 02:00.167
- HEY, OUR HEAT'S OUT
OVER THERE.

02:00.167 --> 02:01.500
- SHUT THE DOOR.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.567
- YEAH.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.267
AND WE REALLY DON'T HAVE
ANY FOOD EITHER

02:04.267 --> 02:05.833
'CAUSE WE WERE GOING AWAY.

02:05.833 --> 02:10.700
- OH, SO YOU CAME OVER
BECAUSE YOU WERE HUNGRY.

02:10.700 --> 02:13.500
WHEN THE MAN ON THE RADIO SAID
THAT THE AIRPORT WAS CLOSED,

02:13.500 --> 02:15.400
I JUST ASSUMED YOU'D CARE ENOUGH

02:15.400 --> 02:17.400
TO SEE IF YOUR PARENTS
HAD FROZEN TO DEATH.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.367
BUT I GUES THAT WAS TOO MUCH.

02:20.367 --> 02:22.333
HEY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

02:22.333 --> 02:25.367
STAY HERE WITH YOUR FAMILY,
WHO LOVES YOU.

02:25.367 --> 02:27.067
- YEAH.

02:27.067 --> 02:28.333
- OH, AMY,

02:28.333 --> 02:30.633
SUCH A NICE SURPRISE.

02:30.633 --> 02:32.067
- HI, MARIE.

02:32.067 --> 02:34.967
HEY, FRANK,
NICE FIRE.

02:34.967 --> 02:37.800
- I LIKE FIRE.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.700
- AH, THAT'S GOOD.
AH. OH, YEAH.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.733
- AMY, COME HERE.

02:43.733 --> 02:46.333
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH
I CAN DO WITHOUT ELECTRICITY,

02:46.333 --> 02:49.233
BUT I WAS ABLE TO MAKE
SOME HAM AND CHEESE SANDWICHES,

02:49.233 --> 02:51.267
TURKEY SANDWICHES,
ROAST BEEF SANDWICHES.

02:51.267 --> 02:52.867
AND, OF COURSE,
THERE'S MACARONI SALAD,

02:52.867 --> 02:55.233
POTATO SALAD,
AND, OF COURSE, REGULAR SALAD.

02:55.233 --> 02:57.567
THEN THERE'S PIES
AND COOKIES AND CAKE

02:57.567 --> 02:59.567
FOR DESSERT.

02:59.567 --> 03:02.167
- MA, YOU'RE TWO PICKLES AWAY
FROM OPENING A DELI.

03:02.167 --> 03:03.867
- [laughs]

03:03.867 --> 03:05.200
- MMM, SO GOOD.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.067
YOU GUYS GOT TO GET IN
ON SOME OF THIS.

03:07.067 --> 03:08.867
- I'M HUNGRY.
I AM HUNGRY.

03:08.867 --> 03:10.533
- YOU PEOPLE
DON'T NEED FOOD.

03:10.533 --> 03:14.600
ALL YOU NEED IS MY WORLD-FAMOUS
SPICED RUM PUNCH.

03:14.600 --> 03:18.167
- OH, BOY, DON'T GET
THAT CLOSE TO THE FIRE.

03:18.167 --> 03:20.267
- YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES
YOUR MOTHER'S VOICE

03:20.267 --> 03:21.867
SOUNDS LIKE
AN AIR-RAID SIREN?

03:21.867 --> 03:26.433
- OH, STOP, FRANK.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

03:26.433 --> 03:27.433
- AH.

03:27.433 --> 03:30.467
IT'S LIKE LIQUID EAR PLUG.

03:31.700 --> 03:32.900
- FILL HER UP.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.600
- THERE YOU GO.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.367
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
FRANK.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.633
I PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER
WITH NOTHING BUT LOVE

03:42.633 --> 03:44.233
AND A FLASHLIGHT.

03:44.233 --> 03:46.300
WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE IS TRYING
TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT,

03:46.300 --> 03:48.600
YOU HAVE TO BE
A MEAN OLD GROUCH.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.133
- FINISHED, OR DO I
NEED TO GET A REFILL?

03:55.167 --> 03:58.800
- OH, I'M FINISHED, ALL RIGHT.
I'M FINISHED WITH YOU.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.067
- HERE'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T GET
ON VACATION.

04:04.433 --> 04:07.667
- HEADS UP.
COMING THROUGH!

04:07.667 --> 04:09.667
AMY.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.400
- ROBERT.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.900
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

04:14.900 --> 04:17.067
- I WAS THEIR RIDE
TO THE AIRPORT.

04:17.067 --> 04:18.600
THEN THE WEATHER...

04:18.600 --> 04:20.167
- OH, RIGHT, YEAH.

04:20.167 --> 04:22.067
I'M KIND OF SURPRISED
I ENDED UP HERE MYSELF,

04:22.067 --> 04:26.100
'CAUSE USUALLY, YOU KNOW,
FRIDAY NIGHT'S PARTY NIGHT.

04:28.633 --> 04:30.600
- HOW ABOUT THE WOOD?

04:30.600 --> 04:33.767
YAH! MULE!

04:33.767 --> 04:36.433
- AMY, HOW'S GIANNI?

04:36.433 --> 04:38.267
- WHY? DID HE SAY SOMETHING?

04:38.267 --> 04:40.233
DID HE SAY
HE BROKE UP WITH ME?

04:40.233 --> 04:42.700
'CAUSE THE TRUTH IS
IT WAS TOTALLY MUTUAL.

04:42.700 --> 04:44.067
- OH...

04:44.067 --> 04:46.833
- ACTUALLY, IT'S FINE.
IT'S PERFECTLY FINE.

04:46.833 --> 04:48.400
WE HAD FUN FOR A WHILE,

04:48.400 --> 04:51.933
BUT IT TURNS OUT HE'S AWFUL
AND AFRAID TO BE HAPPY.

04:51.933 --> 04:54.067
- I'M SORRY, DEAR.

04:54.067 --> 04:56.067
- AH!

04:56.067 --> 04:57.267
- TUCK IN YOUR SHIRT.

04:57.267 --> 04:58.667
- GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!

04:58.667 --> 05:00.233
GET!

05:03.233 --> 05:07.100
- YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING,
WHAT THIS REMINDS ME OF?

05:07.100 --> 05:08.933
- SOMETHING SAD AND COLD
AND BORING?

05:08.933 --> 05:12.700
- [chuckles]
NO, SILLY. NO.

05:12.700 --> 05:16.167
IT REMINDS ME OF OUR
OLD NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTIES.

05:16.167 --> 05:17.400
REMEMBER, FRANK?

05:17.400 --> 05:20.533
BACK WHEN PEOPLE
COULD STAND YOU?

05:20.533 --> 05:22.067
- YEAH.
[laughs]

05:22.067 --> 05:23.433
- I REMEMBER
THE FIRST TIME

05:23.433 --> 05:25.300
I GOT TO STAY UP
WITH THE ADULTS.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.967
AH, IT WAS FUN.
MY FIRST GROWN-UP PARTY.

05:27.967 --> 05:31.967
- YEAH, I REMEMBER THOSE.

05:31.967 --> 05:33.733
I REMEMBER THAT WAS
THE FIRST TIME

05:33.733 --> 05:35.833
THAT I DANCED WITH A GIRL.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.600
LINDA VISOKI.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.167
I REMEMBER I WORKED UP
A DANCE MOVE AHEAD OF TIME.

05:40.167 --> 05:43.300
OH, GOD, I THOUGHT
I WAS SO COOL.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.067
- WHAT? SHOW IT TO US.
- OH, YEAH, COME ON.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.367
- NO! NO! NO!

05:46.367 --> 05:48.800
- LET'S SEE IT.
- COME ON!

05:48.800 --> 05:51.167
- OH, SHOW IT.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.400
- ALL RIGHT.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.067
I THINK IT WENT
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

05:54.067 --> 05:56.233
* HERE I GO

05:56.233 --> 05:59.233
[all cheering]

05:59.233 --> 06:00.967
YOU KNOW YOU LOVE IT!

06:00.967 --> 06:03.533
YOU GOT TO LOVE THAT!

06:05.933 --> 06:08.100
- YEAH, I REMEMBER LINDA WAS
INSTITUTIONALIZED

06:08.100 --> 06:10.767
THE VERY NEXT DAY.

06:10.767 --> 06:12.867
- I DON'T REMEMBER YOU
TEARING UP THE DANCE FLOOR

06:12.867 --> 06:14.700
BACK THEN, BIG MAN.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.100
- OH, LET ME TELL YA,
I HAD THE MOVES, SCRUFFY.

06:17.100 --> 06:18.400
- DO YOUR DANCING, ROBBIE.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.233
- YEAH, LET'S SEE.

06:22.367 --> 06:26.400
YEAH. YEAH, RIGHT.
YEAH.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.533
YEAH, RIGHT.

06:36.300 --> 06:39.467
- HE'S LIKE A HAPPY BUFFALO.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.867
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH YOUR GENERATION.

06:41.867 --> 06:43.333
YOU ONLY THINK
YOU CAN DANCE.

06:43.333 --> 06:44.633
- YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS, DAD,

06:44.633 --> 06:46.800
'CAUSE YOU WANT A PIECE
OF THAT, HUH?

06:46.800 --> 06:48.067
COME ON.

06:48.067 --> 06:49.533
- GET OUT OF HERE WITH THAT.

06:49.533 --> 06:53.067
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

06:53.967 --> 06:57.667
[smooth jazz music]

06:57.667 --> 06:58.867
*

06:58.867 --> 07:00.133
MARIE?

07:00.133 --> 07:01.267
- WHAT?

07:01.267 --> 07:02.700
- GET UP.
GET OVER HERE.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.233
- OH...

07:04.233 --> 07:06.800
WELL, OKAY.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.667
OH, FRANK, THIS IS WONDERFUL.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.600
- TAKE IT EASY.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.500

07:14.500 --> 07:16.800
- OH, ISN'T THAT GREAT?
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.600
- TAKE NOTES.
THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.133
- WHOO!

07:21.133 --> 07:23.500
- NOT BAD THERE,
OLD MAN.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.500
- LOOK AT YOU.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.767
YOU EVER HAVE A GUY
DANCE WITH YOU LIKE THIS?

07:35.767 --> 07:38.467
- NEVER.

07:38.467 --> 07:39.500
- MAY I, MARIE?

07:39.500 --> 07:41.833
I THINK I CAN DO
SOME GOOD HERE.

07:41.833 --> 07:44.433
- OKAY, BUT JUST
FOR A SECOND.

07:49.833 --> 07:53.567
- WHOO!

07:53.567 --> 07:55.367
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING,

YOU'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.067

HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH YOU?"

10:05.900 --> 10:07.333
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT, DEB?

10:07.333 --> 10:09.133
- I WAS TRYIGN
TO SAY SOMETHING NICE.

10:09.133 --> 10:10.867

10:37.367 --> 10:39.800
ONE OF THOSE
THOUGHTS WOULD SLIP OUT.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.400
- ONE OF WHAT THOUGHTS?

10:41.400 --> 10:45.800
- YOU KNOW, THAT YOU THINK
YOU'RE BETTER THAN US.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.500
- WHAT?

10:47.500 --> 10:50.433
- BETTER THAN WHO, EXACTLY?

10:56.433 --> 11:00.267
JUST--JUST YOU AND DAD,
OR ALL OF US?

11:00.267 --> 11:01.567
- ALL OF US.

11:01.567 --> 11:04.067
- MARIE, I SAID SOMETHING
STUPID TO FRANK,

11:04.067 --> 11:07.333
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I THINK I'M BETTER THAN HIM.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.267
- METHINKS THOU DOTH PROTES--

11:09.267 --> 11:12.067
- OH, DON'T SAY, "METHINKS THOU
DOTH PROTEST TOO MUCH."

11:12.067 --> 11:14.933
- ALL RIGHT,
I WON'T SAY IT...

11:14.933 --> 11:18.067
BUT METHINKS IT.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.833
- I DON'T KNOW, MA.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.133
I THINK YOU'RE MAKING WAY
TOO BIG OF A DEAL OUT OF THIS.

11:26.133 --> 11:27.833
- YEAH, WHAT SHE SAID TO DAD,

11:27.833 --> 11:30.067
SHE WAS JUST SURPRISED
HOW DIFFERENT HE WAS ACTING.

11:30.067 --> 11:31.700
HE WAS ALL DELIGHTFUL AND--

11:31.700 --> 11:34.433
- KIND OF SEXY.

11:38.233 --> 11:40.733
I DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

11:43.467 --> 11:46.900
- WELL, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AWARE
OF THIS FEELING OF SUPERIORITY,

11:46.900 --> 11:49.233
AND NOW THAT YOU'VE
MADE IT SO OBVIOUS,

11:49.233 --> 11:54.367
MAYBE IT'S BEST IF I'M THE ONE
TO GO OUT AND GET THAT DEAR MAN.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.067
- "DEAR MAN"?
SOMETHING'S LOOSE.

12:01.067 --> 12:02.667
- WAIT A MINUTE, MARIE.

12:02.667 --> 12:04.633
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU,
OF ALL PEOPLE,

12:04.633 --> 12:07.133
ARE ACCUSING ME
OF ACTING SUPERIOR.

12:07.133 --> 12:08.333
- HERE. HERE YOU GO.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.733
- I DON'T WANT THAT.

12:09.733 --> 12:11.733
- ALL RIGHT.

12:13.367 --> 12:15.100
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, DEAR.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.567
I UNDERSTAND.

12:16.567 --> 12:18.867
YOU GREW UP
IN AN UPPER-CLASS FAMILY.

12:18.867 --> 12:21.800
YOU WENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL,
A FANCY COLLEGE,

12:21.800 --> 12:24.500
AND THAT'S NOT
WHO WE ARE AT ALL.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.733
ROBBIE DIDN'T
EVEN GO TO COLLEGE.

12:26.733 --> 12:31.267
- I ALWAYS ENJOY WHEN WE CAN
BRING THAT UP OUT OF THE BLUE.

12:34.567 --> 12:37.367
- AND IT'S NATURAL FOR YOU
ONCE IN A WHILE TO THINK,

12:37.367 --> 12:41.567
"OH, THOSE LOWER,
MIDDLE-CLASS BARONES."

12:41.567 --> 12:42.900
- MARIE!

12:42.900 --> 12:44.767
- IT'S OKAY, DEAR,
YOU CAN'T HELP IT.

12:44.767 --> 12:47.500
IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.700
- I GREW UP IN CONNECTICUT,
FOR GOD SAKES,

12:50.700 --> 12:52.467
NOT BUCKINGHAM PALACE.

12:52.467 --> 12:53.933
- YOU SEE?

12:53.933 --> 12:57.200
NOW, WHY YOU'D EVEN THINK
TO REFER TO BUCKINGHAM PALACE--

12:57.200 --> 12:58.833
- HEY, HEY, LISTEN!

12:58.833 --> 13:00.833
- AH, COME ON, YOU TWO,
DON'T MAKE A THING.

13:00.833 --> 13:04.367
JUST GET TO THE HUG
AND HAVE A SANDWICH.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.167
- MARIE, WAIT A MINUTE.

13:07.167 --> 13:10.167
DO WE ALWAYS SEE EYE-TO-EYE?
NO.

13:10.167 --> 13:11.633
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
WE'RE DIFFERENT,

13:11.633 --> 13:13.500
NOT BECAUSE
I THINK I'M BETTER,

13:13.500 --> 13:15.100
JUST DIFFERENT.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.933
AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER,
YOU'RE THE TIGHT-KNIT FAMILY.

13:17.933 --> 13:20.233
I WAS THE OUTSIDER,

13:20.233 --> 13:22.800
AND I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT, IN MOST WAYS,

13:22.800 --> 13:25.500
I WAS THE SAME AS YOU GUYS,

13:25.500 --> 13:28.533
BUT I GUESS...

13:28.533 --> 13:32.433
WELL, I'M SORRY
THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

13:37.167 --> 13:41.067
I'M GONNA GO GET FRANK.

13:41.067 --> 13:42.967
- COME ON.

13:42.967 --> 13:44.433
- WHAT?

13:44.433 --> 13:46.633
- COME ON.
WE'RE JUST DIFFERENT THAN YOU?

13:46.633 --> 13:50.500
WE'RE LIKE THE FRONT PORCH
OF THE NUT HOUSE.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.900
- HEY!

13:51.900 --> 13:53.767
- HOW COULD YOU NOT THINK
YOU'RE BETTER THAN US?

13:53.767 --> 13:55.633
IT WOULD BE WEIRD
IF YOU DIDN'T.

13:55.633 --> 13:57.333
- RAYMOND!

13:57.333 --> 13:59.067
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROVE YOUR POINT, MA,

13:59.067 --> 14:00.300
BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:00.300 --> 14:04.467
- WELL, OKAY, THEN.

14:04.467 --> 14:08.300
- NO, SHE'S NOT RIGHT!
RAY, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

14:08.300 --> 14:11.367
- AS IF YOU DON'T KNOW.

14:12.733 --> 14:14.067
- WAIT.

14:14.067 --> 14:15.800
ARE YOU DRUNK?

14:15.800 --> 14:19.633
- [slurring]
DON'T BE PREPOSTEROUS.

14:25.500 --> 14:26.633
- YOU ARE.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.633
- NO, HE'S FINE.
GO AHEAD, RAYMOND.

14:28.633 --> 14:33.133
YOU WERE SAYING
I WAS RIGHT OR SOMETHING.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.567
- YOU DON'T THINK YOU'RE BETTER?

14:34.567 --> 14:36.567
YOU'RE NOT BETTER
THAN FRANK BARONE?

14:36.567 --> 14:43.633
YOU THINK THAT MY FATHER,
A KNOWN BABOON'S ASS...

14:43.633 --> 14:46.067
IS YOUR EQUAL?

14:46.067 --> 14:47.267
- YES.

14:47.267 --> 14:50.433
- [scoffs]
YOU GUYS BUY THAT?

14:52.067 --> 14:54.267
- IT DOES SEEM
A LITTLE HARD TO BELIEVE.

14:54.267 --> 14:57.200
- I MEAN, FRANK IS DISGUSTING.

14:57.200 --> 15:01.300
- I THOUGHT HE WAS SEXY,
SO I GOT MY OWN PROBLEMS.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.433
- THIS IS STUPID.

15:05.433 --> 15:06.833
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS.

15:06.833 --> 15:08.067
- SEE, NOW WE'RE STUPID.

15:08.067 --> 15:10.367
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT, MARIE.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.333
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW
FRANK CAN BE GROSS.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.433
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M BETTER.

15:14.433 --> 15:16.300
- NO?
HOW ABOUT ROBERT?

15:16.300 --> 15:17.600
- HEY, HEY, WAIT, WAIT.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.833
- NO, ROBERT, LET HIM TALK.
GO AHEAD.

15:19.833 --> 15:22.300
- ROBERT'S WEIRD.

15:23.300 --> 15:24.633
HE DOESN'T LIKE
TO GO OUT TO EAT

15:24.633 --> 15:27.967
BECAUSE HE HAS
A FEAR OF BUSBOYS.

15:27.967 --> 15:30.500
HE CAN'T CARRY HIS DOLLAR BILLS
FACING EACH OTHER

15:30.500 --> 15:33.333
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
LIKE THEY'RE KISSING.

15:40.100 --> 15:42.067
- THAT'S JUST QUIRKY.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.567
- YEAH? QUIRKY?

15:44.567 --> 15:46.933
HE SEPARATES
HIS GOOD 'N PLENTIES

15:46.933 --> 15:50.500
INTO "GOODS" AND "PLENTIES."

15:50.500 --> 15:52.500
RIGHT?
WHICH ONE IS WHICH AGAIN?

15:52.500 --> 15:53.633
- NEVER MIND.

15:53.633 --> 15:55.633
- NO, NO, GO AHEAD.
GO AHEAD.

15:57.933 --> 16:01.267
- THE PINKS ARE THE "GOODS,"

16:01.267 --> 16:05.267
AND THE WHITES
ARE THE "PLENTIES."

16:05.267 --> 16:08.233
'CAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS
MORE OF THEM.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.667
AND THEY'RE NOT AS GOOD.

16:17.800 --> 16:22.067
AND THEN THERE'S A THIRD
CATEGORY OF "IRREGULARS."

16:24.733 --> 16:27.767
- AND THEY'RE CALLED...

16:27.767 --> 16:30.567
- "CUTIES."

16:37.967 --> 16:40.267
- I REST MY CASE.

16:40.267 --> 16:45.533
- VERY GOOD.
NOW DO ME, RAYMOND.

16:45.533 --> 16:47.167
- YOU.

16:47.167 --> 16:50.133
WHERE DO I BEGIN?

16:52.067 --> 16:54.167
JUDGMENTAL!

16:54.167 --> 16:56.133
CHILDISH!

16:56.133 --> 16:58.333
MEDDLESOME!

16:58.333 --> 17:02.767
A WORLD-CLASS BUTTINSKY!

17:02.767 --> 17:05.733
I MEAN...

17:07.133 --> 17:09.567
- [laughs]

17:11.900 --> 17:14.633
- YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS?

17:14.633 --> 17:16.333
- NO, I DO NOT.

17:16.333 --> 17:18.800
- NOW SHE'S
JUST BEING STUBBORN.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.833
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, RAYMOND?
YOU'RE BAD TOO.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.300
- LISTEN, I MIGHT BE THE WORST!

17:24.300 --> 17:26.333
DEBRA'S GOT TO LIVE WITH ME

17:26.333 --> 17:28.267
DAY IN AND DAY OUT
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE!

17:28.267 --> 17:31.500
- NOT TOO THRILLED
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

17:32.733 --> 17:36.367
- AND COULD YOU BE?

17:36.367 --> 17:39.567
DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT
A WEEK AGO, YOU CAME HOME,

17:39.567 --> 17:42.367
AND I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
BABYSITTING OR SOMETHING,

17:42.367 --> 17:47.367
AND I WAS JUST ZONKED OUT
ON THE COUCH WITH THE TV GOING?

17:47.367 --> 17:50.733
AND I HAD PIZZA SAUCE
KIND OF ALL DOWN MY CHEST,

17:50.733 --> 17:53.467
WHICH WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN THAT BAD...

17:53.467 --> 17:56.600
IF I HAD BEEN WEARING A SHIRT...

17:57.767 --> 18:01.067
OR EATING PIZZA.

18:04.233 --> 18:07.700
AND DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW I GREETED YOU THAT DAY?

18:07.700 --> 18:09.633
HMM?

18:09.633 --> 18:12.600
HEY, BABY...

18:12.600 --> 18:18.100
THE KIDS ARE ASLEEP,
AND I'M HALFWAY TO NAKED TOWN.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.067
POPULATION: ME.

18:20.067 --> 18:23.067
- OH, GOD.
OKAY! OKAY!

18:23.067 --> 18:24.633
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

18:24.633 --> 18:27.800
THAT I'M BETTER THAN YOU?
FINE!

18:27.800 --> 18:29.533
I AM BETTER!

18:29.533 --> 18:32.667
- [laughs]

18:32.667 --> 18:34.333
I WAS RIGHT!

18:34.333 --> 18:38.500
- YEP! YEP! YOU GOT ME!

18:38.500 --> 18:41.633
YOU KNOW, I WAS NEVER
SURE IF IT WAS TRUE,

18:41.633 --> 18:43.367
BUT THIS, TONIGHT...

18:43.367 --> 18:45.833
I REALLY HAVE
TO THANK YOU ALL.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.067
'CAUSE YOU'VE MADE IT
CRYSTAL CLEAR--

18:48.067 --> 18:50.500
YOU'RE ALL NUTS!

18:52.233 --> 18:54.333
- GOOD JOB, MAN.

18:56.933 --> 18:58.733
- THAT WAS WONDERFUL.

18:58.733 --> 19:05.500
- SO YOU'RE HAPPY THAT
I THINK I'M BETTER THAN YOU?

19:05.500 --> 19:06.900
- NOT HAPPY.

19:06.900 --> 19:09.067
I'M JUST GLAD
WE GOT THIS OUT.

19:09.067 --> 19:10.967
IT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

19:10.967 --> 19:13.300
AND NOW WE KNOW.

19:13.300 --> 19:16.133
- [laughs]
AND NOW WE KNOW.

19:17.067 --> 19:19.667
AND NOW WE SIT.

19:21.767 --> 19:24.700
BECAUSE WE KNOW.

19:28.433 --> 19:32.067
- I REALLY NEED
A VACATION.

19:40.133 --> 19:43.067
HEY, FRANK.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.533
[snowball crashing]

19:45.533 --> 19:47.633
NICE SHOT.

19:47.633 --> 19:49.367
- BACK IN THE DAY,

19:49.367 --> 19:52.300
I COULD TAKE OUT THE WINDOW
OF A MILK TRUCK AT 30 YARDS.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.900
- HEY, LISTEN, I'M SORRY
ABOUT WHAT I SAID BEFORE.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.233
I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN IT.

19:58.233 --> 20:00.167
- EH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

20:00.167 --> 20:02.200
- NO, I WAS MAD
ABOUT OUR TRIP,

20:02.200 --> 20:04.867
AND I HURT
YOUR FEELINGS.

20:04.867 --> 20:06.367
LISTEN, IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

20:06.367 --> 20:08.767
IT'S BEEN HORRIBLE IN THERE
SINCE YOU LEFT.

20:08.767 --> 20:10.600
- OH, YEAH?
- YEAH.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.167
- YOU KNOW, I GUESS I GOT MAD,
'CAUSE...

20:13.167 --> 20:14.900

IT WAS YOU AND ME

IN THERE.

I GUESS.

20:27.567 --> 20:30.100
MAYBE...

20:30.100 --> 20:32.233
- NO, TRUST ME,
WE'RE NOT LIKE THEM.
