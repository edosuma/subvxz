00:03.618 --> 00:05.678
Welcome to <i>Tool Time</i> on location.

00:05.753 --> 00:09.246
And now the star of the show,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

00:16.564 --> 00:18.533
Thank you, everybody,
and welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:18.600 --> 00:20.068
I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor,

00:20.134 --> 00:23.298
and, of course, you all know
my assistant, Al Borland.

00:23.371 --> 00:25.237
To give something back
to the community,

00:25.306 --> 00:28.674
Binford has designed
this complete workshop on wheels.

00:28.776 --> 00:30.335
We'll be coming
into your neighborhood

00:30.411 --> 00:32.141
to help with your household repairs.

00:32.213 --> 00:36.048
That's right, we're equipped to fix
your tools, your car, your plumbing.

00:36.117 --> 00:38.677
And on a good day, your schnauzer.

00:38.753 --> 00:40.325
Let's take a look at this van, shall we?

00:40.355 --> 00:44.122
It's a custom-made Chevy half-ton.
Custom-made flares.

00:44.192 --> 00:47.094
It's got a duel rear axle,
aluminum wheels,

00:47.161 --> 00:49.926
440 horse 350,
but inside is the real story.

00:52.267 --> 00:53.895
This thing is equipped to fix anything

00:53.968 --> 00:56.597
from a Hoover vacuum
to the Hoover Dam.

00:57.238 --> 01:02.176
Complete set of Allen wrenches,
circular saw, cordless drill, table vise.

01:02.744 --> 01:04.644
Even one of Al's vices.

01:05.747 --> 01:08.239
And here we have a laptop computer
with a complete set

01:08.316 --> 01:10.808
of home repair manuals on CD-ROM.

01:10.885 --> 01:15.914
- We call it the brains of the operation.
- Something we've never called Tim.

01:20.695 --> 01:24.826
Moving on. We even have our own
paint department on this van.

01:24.899 --> 01:27.869
You can create the custom color
of your choice, right over here.

01:27.969 --> 01:29.938
And paint isn't the only thing
we make to order.

01:30.038 --> 01:32.337
Because a working man works up
a hearty appetite.

01:32.407 --> 01:35.502
That's why our circular saw
doubles as a deli slicer.

01:36.978 --> 01:38.578
We'll make you a salami
and oak sandwich.

01:38.613 --> 01:40.707
Or how about a dagwood, extra lean?

01:40.782 --> 01:44.150
This brazing furnace?
Well, it's also a barbecue grill.

01:44.218 --> 01:47.711
So while we're sharpening your ax,
"ax us" for a hamburger.

01:47.822 --> 01:51.384
You can wash it down
with a Binford 6100 milkshake

01:51.492 --> 01:54.223
because our paint mixer
doubles as a blender.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.827
- What flavor's that?
- White semi-gloss.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:54.956 --> 02:57.196
I don't get it. We've been driving
around for 20 minutes.

02:57.258 --> 03:00.285
- Where is everybody?
- Maybe nobody has anything broken.

03:00.361 --> 03:02.990
Something is always broken, Al.

03:03.064 --> 03:05.295
Guys, we forgot something.

03:42.303 --> 03:44.602
There you go, Smitty.
Brand-new peephole.

03:45.773 --> 03:47.674
That should cut down
on those unexpected visits

03:47.742 --> 03:49.506
from your ex-wife, huh?

03:49.610 --> 03:52.239
God bless you, Tool Man.
You have given me hope.

03:52.313 --> 03:56.011
Okay, Larry. I finished working
on your weed hacker.

03:56.083 --> 04:00.544
Did the work myself, so I gave you
a little bit more power. Gratis, man.

04:00.888 --> 04:03.194
Added a little bit of weight,
so the balance is a little different.

04:03.224 --> 04:05.455
So let me show you
about handling this bad boy.

04:05.593 --> 04:07.562
Al, help me out. Hold it.

04:07.628 --> 04:10.496
All right, safety first, folks.
Always use your goggles.

04:10.565 --> 04:13.797
But now the motor's a little heavier
now. Starting is the same.

04:13.868 --> 04:17.771
All right. Hold on to here.
Gotta give it a crank, there. Oh, yeah.

04:27.014 --> 04:28.539
Little weed here.

04:30.384 --> 04:32.046
Little weed there.

04:33.287 --> 04:35.347
Just like butter!

04:46.934 --> 04:49.995
There you go, Larry.
Start some hacking, buddy.

04:50.938 --> 04:53.464
- Nicely done, Tim.
- Thank you, Al.

04:53.541 --> 04:56.511
Okay, well, that's it for <i>Tool Time.</i>

05:02.350 --> 05:05.047
Hey, Mom,
what do you think of my face?

05:05.119 --> 05:09.386
It's the most precious,
adorable little face I've ever seen.

05:09.991 --> 05:12.153
No, I'm actually going for a goatee.

05:14.529 --> 05:15.690
Where?

05:17.965 --> 05:20.901
Oh, no, wait!
I see a little something here.

05:21.235 --> 05:22.999
No, that's a pimple.

05:24.338 --> 05:26.671
Oh, come on, Mom.
There's gotta be something down here.

05:26.741 --> 05:28.972
Why are you suddenly growing
a beard, anyway?

05:29.043 --> 05:30.807
Well, 'cause the whole team's doing it.

05:30.912 --> 05:34.246
We decided not to shave
until our winning streak's over.

05:34.315 --> 05:36.181
Well, I'm sure you'll win lots of games

05:36.250 --> 05:37.555
and your beard will grow in
nice and thick.

05:37.585 --> 05:39.417
- Yeah.
- But I don't know why

05:39.487 --> 05:43.925
anybody would want to cover up
that sweet, adorable little face.

05:46.127 --> 05:47.595
Come on, Mom.

05:48.863 --> 05:52.095
- Hey, Brad. Hi, honey.
- Hi, sweetie.

05:52.166 --> 05:54.032
Dad, you can see the goatee, right?

05:54.101 --> 05:57.265
Yeah, but your mom prefers
if I don't bring it up.

05:57.371 --> 06:00.068
- Would you...
- I'm gonna go wash up for dinner.

06:00.141 --> 06:01.507
What are we having for dinner?

06:01.576 --> 06:05.536
Well, the boys are having
leftover something.

06:05.780 --> 06:09.649
And you and I are going to Al's
new girlfriend's for dinner.

06:09.917 --> 06:11.249
- We are?
- Yeah.

06:11.319 --> 06:12.456
He said that he told you all about it.

06:12.486 --> 06:14.421
Don't you ever listen
to anything he says?

06:14.488 --> 06:16.980
I don't have to listen to Al.
He's my assistant.

06:17.058 --> 06:19.926
He gets paid a handsome
wage to listen to me.

06:19.994 --> 06:22.463
When are you gonna get used
to the fact that the whole world

06:22.530 --> 06:24.692
- does not revolve around you?
- I'm used to that fact.

06:24.799 --> 06:27.860
I'm working right now on "Why not?"

06:27.935 --> 06:31.633
Well, regardless, we're having dinner
with Al and Trudy tonight.

06:31.706 --> 06:33.470
Gee, I can't wait!

06:33.541 --> 06:36.375
He said that they've known each other
for about a month,

06:36.444 --> 06:37.776
and she's really nice.

06:37.845 --> 06:41.077
I know her. They met on <i>Tool Time.</i>
Don't you remember?

06:41.148 --> 06:43.708
She was that frumpy kook
with the rat that did the wiring.

06:43.818 --> 06:47.983
She wasn't really the rat lady,
but the real rat bit me on the nose?

06:49.257 --> 06:51.954
- It's gonna be a nightmare.
- It'll be fine.

06:52.026 --> 06:54.791
Oh, you say that now, but wait till
after dinner, Al undoes that belt.

06:57.565 --> 07:01.229
And those three bloodcurdling words,
"Let's play Twister!"

07:05.573 --> 07:08.737
- Do we have the right address?
- Yeah, this is it.

07:09.210 --> 07:12.874
She probably lives in the guesthouse
around back. Let's go back there.

07:12.947 --> 07:17.043
- I thought I heard voices out here! Hey!
- Hi!

07:17.118 --> 07:20.247
Al, does the owner know
you're in the main house?

07:20.721 --> 07:23.885
Of course she does.
The owner's Trudy. Come on in!

07:26.394 --> 07:29.489
Wow! What an incredible house!

07:29.563 --> 07:33.261
Yeah. This thing's gotta be worth
a million bucks.

07:33.334 --> 07:36.168
I mean, a million-two
if it's been re-piped with copper.

07:36.237 --> 07:38.502
This is my home away from home.

07:38.572 --> 07:39.870
- And here's Trudy.
- Oh, hi.

07:39.940 --> 07:42.079
- Trudy, good to see you again.
- Nice to see you, Tim.

07:42.109 --> 07:45.011
So nice to meet you, Jill.
Al just raves about you.

07:45.112 --> 07:47.377
Oh, that's so sweet.

07:47.448 --> 07:52.716
- Well, I brought a three-bean salad.
- Oh, you shouldn't have.

07:52.787 --> 07:54.551
I tried to stop her.

07:57.024 --> 08:01.359
Don't be silly. I'm sure it'll be a perfect
complement to the pheasant.

08:01.595 --> 08:04.030
Pheasant? That's my favorite fowl!

08:04.665 --> 08:06.237
- Here! Let me take that.
- Dinner's almost ready.

08:06.267 --> 08:07.371
- Come on. Sit down.
- Great.

08:07.401 --> 08:09.893
Wow! You have an amazing house.

08:09.970 --> 08:13.907
Oh, thank you.
It's been in the family for years.

08:13.974 --> 08:16.910
- You've heard of the Rockefellers?
- Well, of course.

08:16.977 --> 08:19.503
One of them ran over my grandfather.

08:21.382 --> 08:24.682
- That's awful!
- How many times did they hit him?

08:28.522 --> 08:32.687
All right, so would anyone like
some wine? I have a lovely pinot.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.662
I'm sure you do.
I'll have the wine, though.

08:36.464 --> 08:39.491
Oh, Al. Let's not do the pinot.

08:39.567 --> 08:42.126
I have a '91 Chevalier-Montrachet
I've been saving

08:42.203 --> 08:45.037
- for a special occasion.
- Well, that sounds wonderful.

08:45.106 --> 08:47.371
Oh, then I'll run down
to the wine cellar, get it.

08:47.441 --> 08:50.001
Oh, you know, I'd better go with you
because the white Burgundies

08:50.077 --> 08:52.774
are hidden in the east grotto.
Excuse us.

08:59.387 --> 09:04.724
I can't believe Al never told me
that Trudy was rich.

09:04.792 --> 09:06.864
Well, you know,
that stuff's just not important to Al.

09:06.894 --> 09:08.795
He doesn't date for money.

09:08.863 --> 09:10.991
He'd date for an onion ring.

09:12.433 --> 09:15.597
She's got a grotto? A wine cellar?

09:15.669 --> 09:19.367
When I was a kid, the only thing we
had in the cellar was my grandmother.

09:19.440 --> 09:23.935
"Let me out of here! This duct tape's
starting to hurt me! Come on!"

09:24.011 --> 09:28.381
Well, Trudy seems very nice.
And Al seems so happy.

09:28.983 --> 09:33.944
And I feel so stupid for bringing
a three-bean salad to a mansion.

09:34.054 --> 09:38.082
FYI, that three-bean salad wouldn't
taste any better in a Turkish prison.

09:43.697 --> 09:48.226
- Trudy, that was an incredible dinner.
- Thank you. I love to cook.

09:48.302 --> 09:51.966
- And I love to eat.
- We're perfect for each other.

09:53.774 --> 09:56.744
Excuse me, Trudy.
I got lost going to the bathroom.

09:56.811 --> 10:00.509
Is it left of the bowling alley
or on the other side of it?

10:00.648 --> 10:02.014
- Left.
- Right.

10:02.550 --> 10:05.089
It's hard to believe that you guys
have only been dating a month.

10:05.119 --> 10:08.021
You seem so comfortable
with each other.

10:08.088 --> 10:11.024
I know.
Al and I clicked the minute we met.

10:11.091 --> 10:12.616
Yes, we did.

10:12.693 --> 10:16.789
Although, I was a little gun-shy about
getting back into a serious relationship.

10:16.864 --> 10:19.493
My last relationship ended badly, too.

10:25.005 --> 10:26.496
Strike!

10:29.043 --> 10:32.013
My current relationship
is about to end badly.

10:32.813 --> 10:37.979
Tim's great, but Al, well,
he's sensitive and deep

10:38.085 --> 10:40.145
and he never stops giving.

10:40.621 --> 10:43.113
You make me want to be a better Al.

10:47.928 --> 10:52.298
- I'm gonna go bowl one more frame.
- Tim, come here. Sit down.

10:52.399 --> 10:54.959
- We're both so happy for you.
- Thanks.

10:55.736 --> 10:59.173
Al, did you know that today's
our one-month anniversary?

10:59.240 --> 11:02.802
Did I know? You're darn tooting!

11:03.944 --> 11:06.106
Happy anniversary, Gertrude.

11:06.213 --> 11:08.114
Oh, thank you, Albert.

11:11.218 --> 11:15.246
- I've always wanted one of these!
- A cockroach on a chain.

11:16.690 --> 11:19.250
No, it's a scorpion. It's my birth sign.

11:19.326 --> 11:21.886
- It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

11:21.996 --> 11:24.556
Oh, and I also got
a little something for you, too.

11:45.953 --> 11:47.922
I like to save the paper.

11:55.829 --> 12:00.199
Look! Oh, this is the perfect
addition to my exotic car-key collection.

12:00.267 --> 12:02.793
- Thank you.
- Let me take a look at that.

12:02.870 --> 12:05.032
- Look at that!
- Wow!

12:05.739 --> 12:08.038
That's vintage. It's a Ferrari.
What year was this for?

12:08.108 --> 12:11.636
A '66. For Al's '66 Ferrari.

12:16.350 --> 12:18.717
You know, the one that you
like so much in the garage?

12:18.786 --> 12:21.017
It's yours. Happy anniversary.

12:34.668 --> 12:37.399
It's not just a Ferrari. It's a classic!

12:38.105 --> 12:41.803
- The car is completely inappropriate.
- Wrong. It's perfect.

12:41.909 --> 12:43.878
It's dressy, yet casual.

12:44.578 --> 12:47.878
You don't think that it is slightly
insane to give a Ferrari

12:47.948 --> 12:51.441
- on a one-month anniversary?
- Trudy is loaded.

12:51.518 --> 12:55.080
Her giving him a car
is like you giving me boxer shorts.

12:56.256 --> 12:59.158
You'd have to be shallow
not to see what is going on here.

12:59.226 --> 13:00.592
I see what's going on here.

13:00.694 --> 13:03.562
Al got a Ferrari after sticking it out
for one month!

13:03.631 --> 13:05.369
He holds on for a year,
he'll get the Duesenberg

13:05.399 --> 13:07.925
she's got parked in the garage.

13:08.002 --> 13:09.971
Trudy is a really sweet woman

13:10.070 --> 13:12.801
who has some very serious
self-esteem problems.

13:12.873 --> 13:16.435
She obviously feels that she has to
buy Al to keep him in the relationship,

13:16.510 --> 13:19.776
and I think that Al
is uncomfortable with this.

13:19.847 --> 13:23.181
And he was masking his discomfort
with all that giddy laughter?

13:24.585 --> 13:27.555
So? It's a case
of classic overcompensation.

13:27.655 --> 13:29.927
Oh, stop it. Why are you picking
apart something wonderful

13:29.957 --> 13:32.654
- that happened in Al's life?
- What? The relationship or the car?

13:32.726 --> 13:35.093
Both! There wouldn't be a car
without a relationship.

13:35.162 --> 13:38.530
So you're saying that Trudy
is the perfect woman for Al?

13:38.632 --> 13:40.838
You know, you know, I've always had
a good feeling about her.

13:40.868 --> 13:42.427
You said she was a frumpy kook!

13:43.871 --> 13:46.841
The same thing I've called Al.
They're an ideal couple.

13:48.308 --> 13:50.047
- You don't care about Al.
- Yes, I care about him.

13:50.077 --> 13:53.707
- You just care about that stupid Ferrari!
- Stupid Ferrari?

13:58.285 --> 14:02.848
For the sake of our marriage, I'm going
to pretend that you never said that.

14:03.257 --> 14:05.954
- Where's Al?
- You've asked me 15 times.

14:06.026 --> 14:08.461
Why are you so anxious to see him?

14:19.239 --> 14:21.799
- The car looks great, Al!
- Thanks, Tim.

14:22.643 --> 14:25.010
But there's one thing
that would make it look a lot better.

14:25.079 --> 14:26.116
Me behind the wheel. Can I drive it?

14:26.146 --> 14:27.684
- Please, please, please, please?
- I don't know.

14:27.714 --> 14:29.945
- Come on, once around the parking lot.
- We'll see.

14:30.017 --> 14:31.781
I'm having trouble with this car.

14:31.885 --> 14:34.354
Well, it's a 12-cylinder Ferrari.
It's probably a plug.

14:34.421 --> 14:36.293
I know a guy that'll fix it.
Give me a half hour.

14:36.323 --> 14:38.224
Give me the keys. I'll take it over there.

14:38.359 --> 14:40.123
It's not a mechanical problem.

14:40.227 --> 14:44.096
I'm having a problem
accepting such an extravagant gift!

14:44.164 --> 14:47.134
I mean, all I gave Trudy was
that scorpion pendant.

14:47.768 --> 14:49.794
Well, Ferrari, bug on a chain...

14:50.504 --> 14:52.268
It's the thought that counts, isn't it?

14:52.372 --> 14:54.136
- I don't know.
- You've worked really hard

14:54.208 --> 14:55.972
- your whole life, right?
- Yes.

14:56.844 --> 14:59.780
And what do you have to show for it?
Nothing!

15:01.448 --> 15:05.613
Now, you have a woman who
appreciates the real Al Borland.

15:05.719 --> 15:08.553
The competent, trustworthy,
nice, wonderful human being.

15:08.655 --> 15:10.886
It's you, Al. You deserve it.

15:11.358 --> 15:14.123
- Enjoy this.
- I suppose you're right.

15:14.228 --> 15:15.992
- Yes.
- I should just hold my head up high.

15:16.096 --> 15:18.702
- Hold your head up real high.
- Yeah! And put the pedal to the metal!

15:18.732 --> 15:21.600
- Pedal to the metal!
- And enjoy the ride that is my life!

15:21.668 --> 15:23.398
- Ride that is your life!
- Yeah!

15:23.504 --> 15:25.132
- Here are the keys!
- Here are the keys!

15:25.205 --> 15:27.470
- There they go!
- There they go.

15:27.541 --> 15:31.239
You were fantastic. I don't understand
why you're so upset about this game.

15:31.345 --> 15:34.645
Mom, it was a disaster. We won eight
to nothing and I scored three goals.

15:34.715 --> 15:37.879
To most people that would be a good
thing. What am I missing here?

15:37.985 --> 15:39.757
No, Mom. I'm missing something.
Facial hair, okay?

15:39.787 --> 15:44.122
The rest of the team looks like ZZ Top
and I look like a four-year-old.

15:46.493 --> 15:49.053
Poor baby. I mean, you're
the best player on the team,

15:49.162 --> 15:53.463
and everyone else is gonna get those
coveted facial-hair scholarships.

15:56.036 --> 15:58.475
So what you're saying is I really
shouldn't worry about my looks,

15:58.505 --> 16:00.811
and I should more or less focus
on what's important in life?

16:00.841 --> 16:03.106
- Exactly.
- You're so way off.

16:06.246 --> 16:08.613
- Hey, the goatee's coming in!
- You're funny.

16:08.715 --> 16:12.208
All right! House looks good.
You look great, honey.

16:12.986 --> 16:15.956
- Al let you drive the Ferrari?
- Bada-bing!

16:17.190 --> 16:20.854
- So how's the relationship going?
- Perfect! It's like the car and I are one.

16:21.995 --> 16:23.734
No, I mean the relationship
with Al and Trudy.

16:23.764 --> 16:26.393
Oh, Al's sitting
on top of the world right now.

16:26.466 --> 16:29.368
Do you mean
that he is 100 % comfortable

16:29.436 --> 16:31.962
with accepting this expensive gift?

16:32.973 --> 16:37.468
Eighty percent, but I'll have him all
the way there by Friday, guaranteed.

16:39.746 --> 16:43.649
- Hey, buddy. How's it going?
- Well, hi ho, Al.

16:43.717 --> 16:45.948
You look like you're getting ready
for the Grand Prix.

16:46.019 --> 16:49.387
Well, I thought I would embrace
the Ferrari lifestyle.

16:50.324 --> 16:51.986
What do you think?

16:52.226 --> 16:56.186
Well, to quote my old friend, the
famous race-car driver, Stirling Moss,

16:56.263 --> 16:57.822
"You look fine."

16:58.532 --> 17:00.237
I stopped by to see
if you'd like to take a lap

17:00.267 --> 17:01.505
around the neighborhood with me.

17:01.535 --> 17:04.835
Well, I'd love to,
but I gotta finish checking this wiring.

17:04.905 --> 17:06.167
Well, no rush.

17:06.240 --> 17:10.143
We still have to wait for Tim
to come back from his test drive.

17:15.415 --> 17:19.546
Assuming he comes back.
I'd hate for him to run off

17:19.619 --> 17:21.248
with Trudy's generous gift.

17:21.320 --> 17:23.619
You obviously are enjoying it
very much.

17:23.690 --> 17:28.754
Oh, I am. I am. I mean, at first
I was a little uncomfortable,

17:28.829 --> 17:32.197
but then, Tim gave me
some very deep insights.

17:40.374 --> 17:44.038
Yeah, he said not to worry
about how much the car costs.

17:44.111 --> 17:46.546
He said even though I thought it was
an inappropriate gift

17:46.613 --> 17:48.479
that I should just relax and enjoy it.

17:48.549 --> 17:50.074
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm,
mmm-hmm.

17:50.150 --> 17:52.950
And you should've seen the look on
Trudy's face when she gave it to me.

17:53.020 --> 17:56.787
- Oh, she was so happy.
- So Trudy was happy

17:56.890 --> 17:59.826
and Tim was happy,
but you don't sound so sure.

17:59.893 --> 18:04.388
Well, this kind of puts a little
pressure on the relationship.

18:05.098 --> 18:08.796
I mean, suddenly, you know,
the emotional stakes are much higher.

18:08.869 --> 18:13.705
And what if it doesn't work out? How
can I walk away without feeling guilty?

18:14.608 --> 18:19.706
You can always drive away.
You've got a really fast car.

18:21.615 --> 18:26.679
Oh, Albert, I'm sorry.
Have you talked to Trudy about this?

18:26.753 --> 18:29.917
Oh, I can't.
I don't want to hurt her feelings.

18:30.023 --> 18:31.582
Well, what about you?

18:31.892 --> 18:34.259
You know, the patriot Thomas Paine
said, "It is necessary

18:34.328 --> 18:37.662
"to the happiness of a man
that he be faithful to himself."

18:38.298 --> 18:40.164
I suppose you're right.

18:46.273 --> 18:47.571
I have just been to heaven,

18:47.641 --> 18:50.167
where, by the way,
they still give speeding tickets!

18:54.514 --> 18:59.077
Gosh, Al. I am so glad you stopped by.
Guess what I picked up for you today?

18:59.186 --> 19:00.415
A plane?

19:02.122 --> 19:04.284
No, just driving gloves.

19:04.524 --> 19:08.256
- Would you like a plane?
- No.

19:08.328 --> 19:13.824
Trudy, I wouldn't. I... The fact is,
I really don't even want the car.

19:15.702 --> 19:18.365
- Are you breaking up with me?
- No.

19:18.438 --> 19:22.000
- Why would you even think that?
- Isn't that the first sign?

19:22.109 --> 19:24.271
The man returns the Ferrari.

19:25.011 --> 19:28.641
Oh, no. Trudy, I really like you.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.610
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

19:32.419 --> 19:35.082
I remember the first time I saw you,
you had that wire

19:35.155 --> 19:38.284
in one hand,
and the rat in the other hand,

19:38.358 --> 19:42.523
and I said to myself, "Oh, boy, Al!
Don't let this one get away!"

19:45.799 --> 19:48.963
Wow. You really don't care
about my money and my cars

19:49.035 --> 19:51.971
- and my wine cellar?
- No. I care about you.

19:54.341 --> 19:56.105
I just...
I would feel a lot more comfortable

19:56.176 --> 19:59.010
if material things
didn't come between us.

20:00.180 --> 20:02.843
I'm not letting you
get away so fast, either.

20:08.355 --> 20:11.814
"Dear Trudy, I know Al feels
it's best to return the Ferrari,

20:11.892 --> 20:14.020
"and I respect that.

20:14.094 --> 20:17.929
"In the short time I was
with the car, we became very close.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.731
"And if at any point you need someone
to be its big brother,

20:22.836 --> 20:24.862
"please know that I'm here.

20:25.538 --> 20:31.774
"Sincerely, Tim Taylor, the man who
controls whether Al works weekends."

20:36.950 --> 20:39.510
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi. It just may be over.

20:40.654 --> 20:42.953
- Al and Trudy?
- No, no. Me and the car.

20:45.725 --> 20:49.958
Al decided it was a bit too extravagant,
so he gave the Ferrari back.

20:50.230 --> 20:52.165
I'm sorry for your loss.

20:52.699 --> 20:56.932
It's not hopeless. I'm petitioning
to be the car's big brother.

20:58.572 --> 21:00.977
I'm actually pretty happy.
I think Trudy's gonna be good for Al.

21:01.007 --> 21:05.377
Yeah, I like her.
And she gave me her pheasant recipe.

21:07.481 --> 21:12.215
Fresh pheasant, fairly fatty,
fricassee it with a flick of fennel,

21:12.285 --> 21:13.981
fling it on the fire, fabulous.

21:18.959 --> 21:22.123
- Hey, everybody. Great news!
- Hey. Your soccer team finally lost!

21:22.195 --> 21:23.959
- We got killed.
- All right!

21:24.030 --> 21:26.590
I'm excited. Now I don't have to grow
a beard anymore.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.864
Yeah, and when I come to your next
home game, I'll actually be able

21:29.936 --> 21:31.598
to cheer you to win.

21:31.671 --> 21:33.677
Yeah. I'm excited
'cause now I can fit in with the team.

21:33.707 --> 21:35.403
We decided to wax our legs.

21:37.277 --> 21:38.575
Whoa, waxing!

21:39.946 --> 21:41.666
A pretty weird way
for the Westside Warriors

21:41.715 --> 21:43.877
to wind their way to the World Cup.

21:47.587 --> 21:50.523
They've known each other for about
a month, and she's really nice.

21:50.590 --> 21:53.822
I know her. They met on <i>Tool Time.</i>
Don't you remember?

21:53.894 --> 21:57.922
She's that frumpy, kooky... What?

22:00.767 --> 22:03.327
Yeah. She met on <i>Tool Time.</i>
She came there just to be with Al.

22:03.403 --> 22:05.167
She's that frumpy, kooky woman.
Right?

22:05.272 --> 22:07.400
- Okay, one more time.
- Okay.

22:10.310 --> 22:14.077
She met him on <i>Tool Time.</i>
That frumpy kook that had the...
