00:14.529 --> 00:15.580
Faith.

00:17.530 --> 00:18.690
Come on.

00:33.130 --> 00:34.320
It's okay.

00:41.530 --> 00:42.579
Rest here.

01:03.729 --> 01:05.099
You rest now.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.209
I'll put your stuff here.

01:21.129 --> 01:22.359
I'll be close.

01:27.730 --> 01:28.780
Angel.

01:30.129 --> 01:31.140
Yeah?

01:37.930 --> 01:39.090
Nothing.

03:15.770 --> 03:16.960
Bitch.

03:17.569 --> 03:18.800
Not you, obviously.

03:20.569 --> 03:23.449
I'm so sorry that
I allowed this to happen.

03:24.770 --> 03:28.419
It was Faith who allowed her elbow
to collide with my face.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.569
Not your fault.

03:33.770 --> 03:35.770
At least you only got the elbow.

03:38.569 --> 03:43.139
If it's any consolation, it looks like
you were tortured by a larger woman.

03:45.169 --> 03:48.889
- She's still here, I assume.
- He gave her his bed.

03:52.370 --> 03:54.050
- Wesley.
- Angel.

03:54.169 --> 03:57.889
I didn't expect to see you in today.
How you feeling?

03:59.569 --> 04:02.379
- As well as can be expected.
- Good.

04:05.569 --> 04:06.729
Doughnuts?

04:10.969 --> 04:13.039
Developed a sweet fang, have you?

04:13.370 --> 04:15.650
- You got jelly?
- Whole selection.

04:19.370 --> 04:23.129
Won't she find it difficult enjoying
delicious jelly doughnuts...

04:24.170 --> 04:27.149
...if she is, one assumes,
bound and gagged?

04:29.569 --> 04:32.269
- We already went through this.
- You were right.

04:32.569 --> 04:35.199
The police are ill-equipped
to hold a slayer.

04:35.569 --> 04:37.740
I see why you didn't turn her over.

04:38.569 --> 04:42.500
But I don't see why the woman
who brutally tortured me last night...

04:43.370 --> 04:45.439
...this morning, gets pastries!

04:47.569 --> 04:50.029
I don't have anything else downstairs.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.629
Do you want to let her starve?

04:54.170 --> 04:57.329
There are more humane ways
to deal with a rabid animal.

04:57.769 --> 04:59.209
- She's not an animal.
- No?

04:59.569 --> 05:02.899
She's a person.  Don't forget,
we don't give up on people.

05:04.370 --> 05:07.810
Don't take the moral high ground
with me after what she did.

05:07.970 --> 05:10.810
I believe in helping people,
not coddling killers!

05:11.569 --> 05:14.060
Not long ago you wanted
to rehabilitate her.

05:14.569 --> 05:17.829
Not too long ago I had
full feeling in my right arm!

05:18.769 --> 05:22.139
- She wants to change.
- There is evil in that girl, Angel.

05:22.970 --> 05:27.750
It doesn't matter what she wants
or says she wants.  She'll kill again.

05:38.569 --> 05:40.319
- He'll come around.
- Wesley?

05:41.569 --> 05:43.959
Sure!  People always get
a little funny...

05:44.569 --> 05:47.449
...right after they've been
sadistically tortured.

05:48.170 --> 05:51.189
Well, you'd know.
I need you to sign these.

05:54.170 --> 05:57.290
- You see why we have to help, right?
- Totally.  Here.

05:57.769 --> 06:00.470
We can't arbitrarily decide
who's worth saving.

06:00.769 --> 06:02.839
Oh, I know!  And this one?

06:06.170 --> 06:07.569
Thanks.

06:07.970 --> 06:10.600
- Wait, those were all made out to you.
- Yeah.

06:12.769 --> 06:13.930
"Paid vacation"?

06:14.569 --> 06:18.149
Like I'll stick around while
psycho case is loose downstairs...

06:18.769 --> 06:22.250
...with three tons
of medieval weaponry?  Not!

06:22.970 --> 06:24.930
Oh, and I'm thinking:

06:25.970 --> 06:28.600
Sugar high? Maybe not a great idea.

06:42.810 --> 06:44.560
They gotta check in the back.

06:48.209 --> 06:50.769
- See if the neighbors heard anything.
- Right.

07:00.209 --> 07:04.389
- Kate.  What are you doing here?
- I'm a detective, Kendrick.

07:05.009 --> 07:07.220
See?  I'm detecting.

07:08.610 --> 07:11.519
- Heard we have a fugitive.
- Yeah.

07:12.810 --> 07:16.220
Felony arrest warrant
from Sunnydale.  I've seen it.

07:17.009 --> 07:19.399
Is she the one
who threw the party here?

07:20.009 --> 07:22.360
The victim identifies her
as his mugger.

07:22.410 --> 07:25.360
Put him in the hospital,
stole his keys and wallet.

07:26.009 --> 07:28.819
We're lifting prints now.
I bet we get a match.

07:33.810 --> 07:35.069
Anything else?

07:36.810 --> 07:40.139
Why are you examining a crime scene
you're not assigned to?

07:40.410 --> 07:42.199
- It looked interesting.
- Right.

07:43.410 --> 07:45.269
- You've heard the rumors.
- What?

07:45.810 --> 07:48.970
You know, she supposedly
has some supernatural powers?

07:50.009 --> 07:51.550
- Really?
- Come on, Kate.

07:51.810 --> 07:54.060
Everyone knows you've gone all Scully.

07:54.810 --> 07:57.860
Anytime we get a weird case,
you're there.

07:58.410 --> 08:00.129
What's going on with you?

08:00.810 --> 08:02.839
Scully is the skeptic.

08:03.209 --> 08:04.009
Huh?

08:04.410 --> 08:07.180
Mulder is the believer.
Scully is the skeptic.

08:08.610 --> 08:11.420
- Scully is the chick, right?
- Yes.

08:11.610 --> 08:15.230
- But she doesn't want to believe.
- And you want to believe?

08:17.009 --> 08:18.759
Oh, I already believe.

08:20.009 --> 08:21.410
That's the problem.

08:36.210 --> 08:37.289
Faith?

08:49.409 --> 08:50.570
I have doughnuts.

08:57.210 --> 08:59.980
I understand what
you're going through...

09:02.610 --> 09:04.120
...and I want to help.

09:07.409 --> 09:09.759
But there are a few things
you must do.

09:10.409 --> 09:11.850
First...

09:14.009 --> 09:15.970
...I need you to give me that knife.

09:38.610 --> 09:39.980
You should be resting.

09:41.610 --> 09:43.710
I've been asleep for eight months.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.580
You rest.

09:53.769 --> 09:55.029
- We found her.
- Where?

09:55.570 --> 09:57.710
- She's with him.
- Is he dead?

09:57.970 --> 10:02.009
Well, he is a vampire.
So technically, yes, he is dead.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.809
But not by her hand.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.100
- She is his house guest.
- What?

10:07.570 --> 10:12.070
Our assassin hasn't done her job
because she's rooming with the mark.

10:12.970 --> 10:15.710
- We hired her to kill him.
- I did say "assassin."

10:15.970 --> 10:18.779
- He invites her to stay the night.
- He's not easy.

10:19.570 --> 10:23.399
He can't be bought.  He can't
be killed, even by a vampire slayer.

10:24.370 --> 10:28.200
- Rumor has it he used to date one.
- Who else knows about this?

10:29.169 --> 10:31.519
No one outside of this room.
Not yet anyway.

10:32.169 --> 10:34.240
The senior partners won't like it.

10:34.570 --> 10:37.169
We conspired with her,
paid her half up front...

10:37.570 --> 10:39.850
...and now she makes us
look like fools.

10:41.769 --> 10:45.070
So the question is,
how are we gonna fix it?

10:48.370 --> 10:50.230
I say we kill her.

10:54.370 --> 10:55.240
Faith, no!

10:59.169 --> 11:02.149
- You killed a man,
- I don't care,

11:09.370 --> 11:10.070
Faith.

11:14.769 --> 11:16.769
You're in no condition to leave.

11:17.169 --> 11:20.429
If you go, you'll run
for the rest of your short life.

11:21.370 --> 11:24.919
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter.  It matters to me.

11:25.570 --> 11:28.409
Why are you doing this?
Why are you being nice?

11:29.169 --> 11:30.539
Stop it.

11:32.769 --> 11:34.590
You gonna move or do we fight?

11:34.570 --> 11:37.029
- Am I your prisoner here?
- No.  You're not.

11:37.570 --> 11:40.549
- So I'm free.
- Don't know about that.

11:44.769 --> 11:46.100
But the door's open.

11:48.970 --> 11:51.710
Where will you go?
Back out in that darkness?

11:53.169 --> 11:57.100
I once told you that you didn't
have to go out in that darkness.

11:57.370 --> 12:00.850
That it was your choice.
Well, you chose.

12:05.169 --> 12:09.279
You thought that you could
just touch it.  That you'd be okay.

12:11.169 --> 12:13.169
Five by five, right, Faith?

12:13.570 --> 12:15.250
But it swallowed you whole.

12:16.570 --> 12:17.830
So tell me:

12:19.570 --> 12:20.899
How'd you like it?

12:31.570 --> 12:32.799
Help me?

12:35.769 --> 12:36.779
Yeah.

13:11.169 --> 13:12.570
Hello, Wesley.

13:22.330 --> 13:24.399
So, Los Angeles.

13:30.129 --> 13:31.000
California.

13:34.330 --> 13:35.940
Who knew you'd end up here?

13:36.129 --> 13:39.220
It was as good a place as any
to re-evaluate my life...

13:39.730 --> 13:42.639
...after being asked to resign
from the Council.

13:43.929 --> 13:46.769
And the weather.  I find it...

13:48.730 --> 13:49.600
...dry.

13:49.929 --> 13:52.629
They wouldn't give you dosh
for the fare home?

13:52.929 --> 13:54.190
No, they wouldn't.

13:54.730 --> 13:58.379
Alchemists on the board of directors,
and we still fly coach.

13:58.929 --> 14:00.889
Miserly bastards.

14:01.929 --> 14:04.350
A frugal lot, to be sure,
but not stupid.

14:04.330 --> 14:07.029
And willing to admit
they've made a mistake.

14:09.730 --> 14:12.570
- Made a mistake?
- How would you like to come home?

14:13.330 --> 14:16.210
- Back to England with us.
- Home?

14:16.330 --> 14:20.720
The Council's willing to reinstate you
to your rightful position as Watcher.

14:22.929 --> 14:26.409
It was a nasty business in Sunnydale,
but nobody blames you.

14:27.129 --> 14:31.659
Really?  I rather got the impression
they did when they sacked me.

14:33.730 --> 14:35.379
As I said.  Mistake.

14:37.929 --> 14:40.700
One that can now be corrected
with your help.

14:45.730 --> 14:49.629
We know where she is,
and we know you have access to her.

14:56.529 --> 15:01.100
- No.  I couldn't possibly.
- Loyalty to a vampire now, is it?

15:03.129 --> 15:06.110
It's all right.
That's not why we're here.

15:07.929 --> 15:12.500
A rogue slayer, Wesley.  Far more
dangerous than any single vampire.

15:13.929 --> 15:17.190
- Surely you understand that.
- All too well.

15:18.129 --> 15:19.639
Then you'll help us?

15:19.929 --> 15:23.720
Why come to me? You know where
she is. Take her yourselves.

15:24.730 --> 15:27.850
You three are the best.
The Council's elite.  The--

15:30.730 --> 15:32.940
She cleaned your clocks, didn't she?

15:34.330 --> 15:38.860
She's betrayed our calling,
the Council, you.

15:40.330 --> 15:43.840
She has power and the willingness
to use that power for evil.

15:44.529 --> 15:45.929
She must be stopped.

15:58.049 --> 16:00.049
So how does this work?

16:02.250 --> 16:04.389
There's no simple answer to that.

16:05.850 --> 16:09.330
I won't lie and say it'll be easy,
because it won't be.

16:10.649 --> 16:14.299
You want to change.  Doesn't mean
the world's ready for you to.

16:15.450 --> 16:18.429
The truth is,
no matter how much you suffer...

16:19.049 --> 16:22.309
...or how many good deeds you do
to make up for the past...

16:23.250 --> 16:25.850
...you may never balance out
the cosmic scale.

16:26.850 --> 16:29.549
I can promise that
you'll probably be haunted.

16:30.450 --> 16:32.590
Maybe for the rest of your life.

16:34.649 --> 16:36.470
So how does this work?

16:44.250 --> 16:46.809
Power level, time, start.

16:48.450 --> 16:53.019
- That popcorn gonna be enough for you?
- Yeah.  I can live off the stuff.

16:54.450 --> 16:57.889
- Tell Cordelia I'll pay her back.
- It belonged to Wesley.

17:00.450 --> 17:03.570
- Maybe we just don't mention it, then.
- Maybe we do.

17:05.848 --> 17:08.660
- Are you saying I gotta apologize?
- Think you can?

17:10.650 --> 17:12.049
I don't know.

17:13.049 --> 17:15.579
How do you say,
"Gee, sorry I tortured you"?

17:16.049 --> 17:17.660
I'd leave off the "Gee."

17:18.450 --> 17:21.289
And I think you have
to ask yourself;  Are you?

17:22.049 --> 17:23.980
- What?
- Sorry.

17:28.049 --> 17:31.980
There are things you can't take back,
no matter how sorry you are.

17:32.849 --> 17:37.240
- I've got experience in that area.
- You've done this for 100 years.

17:37.650 --> 17:40.839
- I can't handle 10 minutes.
- So handle the next five.

17:41.849 --> 17:44.240
- I don't think I can.
- Yes, you can.

17:44.849 --> 17:48.039
- I hate that it hurts like this.
- It's supposed to hurt.

17:48.450 --> 17:51.220
All that pain you caused
is coming back on you.

17:52.049 --> 17:56.049
Feel it!  Deal with it!  Then maybe
you've got a shot at being free.

17:58.650 --> 18:02.440
I gotta be the first slayer
in history sponsored by a vampire.

18:04.049 --> 18:06.329
I've got experience in that area too.

18:07.049 --> 18:10.839
Oh, God.  "B."  How will I ever
make things right with her?

18:11.849 --> 18:13.319
This isn't about Buffy.

18:13.650 --> 18:16.700
There was only one person
who tried to be my friend...

18:17.250 --> 18:19.990
...who went out of her way
when I didn't deserve it...

18:20.849 --> 18:25.130
...and I screwed her.  Not to mention
her boyfriend.  Only him, literally.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.089
- Faith, we never actually--
- Not you.  The new one.

18:36.450 --> 18:37.819
Oh, my God.

18:38.849 --> 18:41.240
- Angel, I'm so sorry.  I--
- No.  There.

18:42.450 --> 18:43.640
You can say it.

18:44.849 --> 18:46.180
That's good.

18:49.650 --> 18:50.700
Good.

18:53.529 --> 18:56.299
Thank you for coming down
on such short notice.

18:57.130 --> 18:59.339
We can rely on your professionalism?

18:59.529 --> 19:02.789
We've had trouble
with freelancers in the past.

19:03.730 --> 19:05.130
Do you take cream?

19:06.130 --> 19:07.710
No.  All right.

19:09.730 --> 19:10.890
Here's the target.

19:10.930 --> 19:14.720
Don't let the picture fool you.
She's tougher than she looks.

19:15.730 --> 19:19.559
We're not talking anything elaborate,
no slow or painful death.

19:20.529 --> 19:24.529
- Well, some pain would be good.
- The point is, we want her dead.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.900
Yes. Dead.

19:27.730 --> 19:28.890
A lot.

19:29.529 --> 19:33.079
Just so we're clear, we won't
put any of this down on paper.

19:33.730 --> 19:36.640
This is strictly a handshake deal.

19:37.329 --> 19:41.119
Not that hands are necessary
for us to do business with you.

19:42.130 --> 19:45.250
That was speciesist of me.
I apologize if I--

19:47.529 --> 19:49.990
--offended you in any way.

20:01.329 --> 20:03.539
Careful.
The sedative in that syringe...

20:04.329 --> 20:08.299
...is powerful enough to bring down
a man twice your size or a slayer.

20:09.130 --> 20:11.759
- How does it work?
- How do you think?

20:12.730 --> 20:15.049
You jab her with it, don't you?

20:17.529 --> 20:20.410
A little pressure on the flesh
and she'll feel it.

20:21.130 --> 20:23.059
- You intend to take her alive?
- Yes.

20:23.529 --> 20:26.230
She'll be out long enough
to take to England.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.779
There, she'll begin
her rehabilitation.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.160
The Council believes
she can be rehabilitated?

20:32.529 --> 20:34.250
We have every confidence.

20:35.529 --> 20:39.529
Signal us as soon as it's done,
and we'll take care of the rest.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.240
Thanks.

20:45.730 --> 20:47.829
I have some conditions of my own.

20:49.329 --> 20:50.660
Just one, actually.

20:51.130 --> 20:53.660
- Don't harm the vampire.
- Don't be a ponce!

20:54.130 --> 20:56.269
You won't get any help from me.

20:56.529 --> 21:00.109
- We have no quarrel with the vampire.
- Other than him being one.

21:00.730 --> 21:04.450
He's a special case.
He's reformed.  He has a soul.

21:07.329 --> 21:10.769
In point of fact, I've confronted
more evil, slain more--

21:12.730 --> 21:15.640
--demons, done more good,
while working with Angel...

21:16.329 --> 21:19.140
...than I ever did while
in the Council's employ.

21:19.930 --> 21:22.740
- We'll make every effort.
- No.  Not every effort.

21:22.930 --> 21:25.740
No harm. I must have your word.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.380
Done.

21:34.369 --> 21:35.559
Where's the dough?

21:36.769 --> 21:38.420
What'd you do with it?

21:39.170 --> 21:41.589
--final round,  We'll be right back,

21:41.569 --> 21:44.799
Coming up next on the
Channel 3 News, local council--

21:55.369 --> 21:56.380
Everything okay?

21:56.569 --> 22:00.220
It was scary for the four minutes
I was alone, but I survived.

22:04.970 --> 22:08.829
left-fielder Drew will step
into the box, batting ,321 on the--

22:09.769 --> 22:14.190
LAPD, in conjunction with
the Feds, are looking for this woman,

22:15.170 --> 22:18.930
The felony suspect from
the California town of Sunnydale...

22:19.369 --> 22:20.140
Faith?

22:20.569 --> 22:22.740
...has fled to Los Angeles
in recent days,

22:22.970 --> 22:24.759
- Witnesses identified her...
- What?

22:25.369 --> 22:29.579
...as involved in several assaults,
Police want your help in finding her,

22:30.170 --> 22:33.470
It's okay.  We knew about this.
Nothing's changed--

22:34.369 --> 22:37.109
Anyone with any information
about this suspect...

22:37.970 --> 22:40.359
...should call
law enforcement immediately,

22:40.369 --> 22:44.940
Do not approach her,  She's violent
and unpredictable, Any questions?

22:46.369 --> 22:50.269
Listen to me.  You're safe here.
You hear me? You're safe.

23:16.369 --> 23:17.069
No.

23:25.369 --> 23:27.619
Hey, hey. Shh. Hey.

23:29.569 --> 23:31.960
Sit down.  It's okay.

23:31.970 --> 23:34.000
It's gonna be okay, all right?

23:35.569 --> 23:36.650
All right.

23:52.529 --> 23:53.579
Buffy.

23:55.529 --> 23:57.069
- I didn't know you--
- What--?

23:59.130 --> 24:00.039
How--

24:02.730 --> 24:06.099
- What are you doing?
- She-- We were attacked.

24:08.130 --> 24:09.210
"We"?

24:10.529 --> 24:12.849
- You and....
- Faith.

24:15.329 --> 24:16.589
You and Faith.

24:19.529 --> 24:23.670
- It's not what you think.
- You think I can form a thought now?

24:25.529 --> 24:26.829
Giles heard that...

24:28.529 --> 24:30.180
...she tried to kill you.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.089
That's true.

24:36.329 --> 24:39.029
So you're punishing her
with a severe cuddling?

24:39.329 --> 24:43.049
- Is that why you came? To punish her?
- I was worried about you.

24:46.529 --> 24:47.720
Buffy.

24:51.329 --> 24:52.519
Oh, God.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.450
- Didn't think I'd find you, did you?
- Let's talk.

25:01.529 --> 25:03.990
- Talking isn't in order now.
- She needs help.

25:04.529 --> 25:07.549
- You have any idea what she did to me?
- Yes.

25:11.130 --> 25:12.460
Do you care?

25:12.930 --> 25:16.900
- She wants to change, a chance to--
- No.  No chance. Jail.

25:18.329 --> 25:20.150
- You think that'll help?
- Buffy.

25:21.930 --> 25:25.119
- I'm sor--
- Apologize and I'll beat you to death.

25:27.930 --> 25:30.250
- Go ahead.
- This is not gonna happen.

25:30.329 --> 25:31.839
You'll have to stop me.

25:32.130 --> 25:34.019
- Don't do this.
- Go upstairs now.

25:34.529 --> 25:35.900
- You think I'll--
- Back off.

25:36.329 --> 25:38.750
- I'm not letting her out of my sight.
- Go!

25:39.329 --> 25:40.519
Don't you move a--

25:47.730 --> 25:48.779
I'm sorry.

25:51.329 --> 25:52.519
I'm sorry.

26:02.730 --> 26:03.599
Faith.

26:05.130 --> 26:09.700
- Going somewhere?
- No. Just wanted to be alone.

26:12.930 --> 26:14.259
Angel downstairs?

26:15.329 --> 26:16.099
Yeah.

26:18.930 --> 26:19.980
Right.

26:29.490 --> 26:31.140
- Well?
- Strike two.

26:33.089 --> 26:36.279
Ridiculous.  The first assassin
kills the second one...

26:36.690 --> 26:39.220
...sent to kill her,
who assassinated no one...

26:39.690 --> 26:43.410
...until we hired the second assassin
to assassinate her.

26:45.690 --> 26:48.640
- Okay.  This obviously isn't working.
- You think?

26:49.890 --> 26:52.309
- We've gone about this wrong.
- Meaning?

26:52.890 --> 26:55.839
As lawyers, it's a mistake
to work outside the law.

26:56.490 --> 26:58.450
- He's being ironic.
- Not at all.

26:58.890 --> 27:03.240
It's time we moved this fight to
our own turf.  I'll take care of it.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.500
- She's not gonna run.
- Why would she...

27:07.289 --> 27:11.789
...when she has her brave knight
to protect her? Got you.

27:12.690 --> 27:16.730
Does she cry?
Pouty lips, heaving bosom?

27:18.690 --> 27:22.269
- I thought you needed help.
- You think I wanted this to happen?

27:24.089 --> 27:25.140
You hit me.

27:25.289 --> 27:27.990
Not to go all schoolyard,
but you hit me first.

27:28.890 --> 27:31.630
In case you forgot,
you're stronger than me.

27:32.490 --> 27:33.569
You did it for her.

27:33.690 --> 27:36.180
You were three seconds
from making her run.

27:36.690 --> 27:39.180
- She's at a crucial stage.
- She's playing you.

27:39.690 --> 27:41.940
- She tried to kill you!
- That was just...

27:42.690 --> 27:46.019
- ...a cry for help.
- No, that's when you say "help" aloud.

27:46.890 --> 27:49.279
- She did bad things to you.
- You've no idea.

27:49.890 --> 27:52.279
You've no idea
what she's going through.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.559
But, of course, you do.

27:55.890 --> 27:59.750
I'm sorry.  I can't be in your club.
I've never murdered anybody.

28:01.890 --> 28:04.349
- Faith, I told you--
- Slight change of plan.

28:04.890 --> 28:07.210
- Get your coat.
- What's going on?

28:07.890 --> 28:11.789
The Council's team is coming.
They'll expect her to be drugged.

28:12.690 --> 28:13.920
- How many?
- Three.

28:14.490 --> 28:17.680
- I'm afraid you came at a bad time.
- I'm feeling that.

28:18.089 --> 28:20.480
- Why'd you bring them?
- I pretended to help.

28:21.089 --> 28:22.980
- Why aren't you?
- They're killers.

28:23.490 --> 28:27.109
- They've surrounded the building.
- We'll go through the sewers.

28:28.890 --> 28:30.920
- She left.
- She'd head for the roof.

28:31.289 --> 28:34.029
- Buffy can protect her.
- That's not her agenda.

28:34.289 --> 28:37.480
- The sewer's our best route.
- If they don't know about it.

28:38.490 --> 28:40.630
- It wasn't for her.
- I know.

28:40.890 --> 28:42.470
It's because I trust you.

28:43.289 --> 28:46.200
More than three gun-toting
maniacs, at any rate.

28:48.289 --> 28:52.859
Why should I listen to you?  I despise
you and everything you represent.

28:53.690 --> 28:57.410
And when I say "represent"
and "thing," I do mean your clients.

28:59.089 --> 29:03.660
Be that as it may, I have information
that will be of interest to you.

29:04.490 --> 29:06.839
While it's true
we differ on many issues...

29:07.490 --> 29:12.019
- ...we do have one thing in common.
- Our bodies are both 80% water?

29:15.289 --> 29:16.690
An enemy.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.680
- I don't know--
- Sure you don't.

29:23.690 --> 29:27.269
We can't be clear because the law
isn't clear on such matters.

29:27.890 --> 29:31.470
Take for example the creatures
that murdered your father.

29:35.089 --> 29:39.269
They couldn't have been brought
to justice, even if they had lived.

29:39.890 --> 29:43.259
And personally, I feel that
you were totally justified...

29:44.089 --> 29:48.509
...in taking whatever extralegal
measures that you found necessary.

29:51.890 --> 29:54.349
- What do you want?
- There are beings.

29:54.890 --> 29:59.069
Beings not governed by the laws
and strictures we humans have devised.

29:59.690 --> 30:02.779
This man is such a being.
He feels he's above the law.

30:03.890 --> 30:07.609
Which is why he gives aid
and comfort to a known murderer.

30:11.690 --> 30:13.549
The woman you're looking for?

30:14.690 --> 30:15.920
She's with him.

30:27.289 --> 30:29.250
You're not gonna run, Faith.

30:31.490 --> 30:35.349
What do you want to do?
You gonna throw me off the roof again?

30:36.890 --> 30:38.890
Any reason why I shouldn't?

30:41.690 --> 30:45.730
There's nothing I can do for you, "B."
I can't ever make it right.

30:47.089 --> 30:51.200
So you're gonna take off, let us
clean up another one of your messes.

30:52.490 --> 30:53.960
It'd be easier for you.

30:54.289 --> 30:58.049
Till you get bored with guilt
and come back to shake things up?

30:59.089 --> 31:02.420
- That's not gonna happen.
- You're right.  It's not.

31:05.089 --> 31:07.299
Angel said you wouldn't
give me a chance.

31:07.490 --> 31:11.990
I gave you every chance!  I tried so
hard to help you, and you spat on me.

31:14.089 --> 31:17.069
My life was just something
for you to play with.

31:17.690 --> 31:19.299
Angel, Riley...

31:20.089 --> 31:23.039
...anything that you could
take from me, you took.

31:24.890 --> 31:26.990
I've lost battles before...

31:27.289 --> 31:30.309
...but nobody else has ever
made me a victim.

31:32.690 --> 31:35.359
You can't stand that.
You're all about control.

31:35.690 --> 31:40.079
You have no idea what it's like where
nothing's in control or makes sense!

31:41.089 --> 31:44.779
There's just pain and hate
and nothing you do means anything--

31:45.289 --> 31:46.269
Shut up!

31:49.490 --> 31:51.740
Just tell me how to make it better.

31:57.890 --> 31:59.569
That's coming from the roof.

32:03.890 --> 32:06.559
- I didn't give you the signal.
- Shut it.

32:08.690 --> 32:09.740
Vampire.

32:09.890 --> 32:12.730
We can make it to the other building.
Go.

32:45.289 --> 32:47.920
- Weatherby, listen to reason.
- Reason?

32:48.289 --> 32:51.170
A Watcher working for a vampire.
It's perversion.

32:51.890 --> 32:55.890
I must take this guy out.  The guy
up there'll go for me.  Stay here.

32:56.690 --> 32:57.920
Okay.

33:06.890 --> 33:08.150
Keep her steady!

33:08.089 --> 33:08.960
Weatherby.

33:09.289 --> 33:12.980
Do the sacred oaths you swore
as a Watcher mean nothing to you?

33:14.089 --> 33:17.670
As a matter of fact they do.
I swore to protect the innocent.

33:18.289 --> 33:19.799
- Get to the roof.
- What?

33:20.089 --> 33:22.119
- Now!
- Bastard!

33:35.690 --> 33:37.369
One hundred and eighty.

33:45.289 --> 33:47.109
That's for calling me a ponce.

34:20.090 --> 34:21.389
Down! Take it down.

34:29.690 --> 34:30.420
Faith?

35:04.489 --> 35:05.650
Where is she?

35:08.090 --> 35:10.690
You got one shot here, Angel.
Where is she?

35:12.889 --> 35:16.119
Arrest him.  Start with
aiding and abetting a felon.

35:33.289 --> 35:37.789
You'll like your cell.  It faces east
and has a great view of the sunrise.

35:38.690 --> 35:41.289
- What? You know what he is.
- Who are you?

35:41.690 --> 35:43.900
- She's nobody.
- Wait.  This is murder.

35:44.690 --> 35:45.849
- It's okay.
- It's not.

35:45.889 --> 35:49.300
- Get her out of here!
- You are not taking the fall for her.

35:50.090 --> 35:51.170
Buffy.

36:11.690 --> 36:13.650
I'd like to make a confession.

36:25.289 --> 36:27.679
You should've told me
what was going on.

36:28.889 --> 36:31.909
I didn't--  I didn't think
it was your business.

36:34.289 --> 36:37.099
- Not my business?
- I needed more time with Faith--

36:37.289 --> 36:38.800
You needed--

36:39.690 --> 36:44.260
Do you have any idea what it was like
for me to see you with her?

36:45.690 --> 36:48.219
- You went behind my back.
- It wasn't about you!

36:48.690 --> 36:53.110
It was about saving a soul.  That's
what I do and you're not a part of it.

36:54.690 --> 36:57.639
It was your idea
to stay away from each other.

36:58.889 --> 37:02.119
- I came because you were in danger.
- I'm always in danger.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.630
You came for vengeance.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.380
- I have a right to it.
- Not in my city.

37:17.489 --> 37:19.699
I have someone in my life now...

37:22.889 --> 37:24.260
...that I love.

37:25.289 --> 37:29.079
It's not what you and I had.
It's very new.

37:32.489 --> 37:34.070
You know what makes it new?

37:35.489 --> 37:36.929
I trust him.

37:38.489 --> 37:40.000
I know him.

37:44.489 --> 37:47.300
That's great.  It's nice.

37:48.090 --> 37:50.119
You moved on.  I can't.

37:51.090 --> 37:54.389
You found someone new.
I'm not allowed to, remember?

37:54.690 --> 37:58.019
Seeing you cuts me up.
The person I share that with is me!

37:58.889 --> 38:00.500
You don't know me anymore.

38:00.690 --> 38:03.949
Don't come here and expect me
to do things your way.

38:05.489 --> 38:06.610
Go home!

38:21.090 --> 38:22.280
See?

38:23.489 --> 38:25.070
Faith wins again.

38:27.090 --> 38:28.070
Go.

38:46.889 --> 38:48.219
You all right?

38:49.889 --> 38:53.679
For a taciturn, shadowy guy,
I got a big mouth.

38:54.690 --> 38:57.949
- Do you want to go after her?
- Yes.

39:01.889 --> 39:04.380
I don't know how much
my opinion counts but...

39:04.889 --> 39:07.280
- ...you did the right thing.
- Yelling at Buffy?

39:07.889 --> 39:09.820
No.  The other thing.

39:11.489 --> 39:12.610
I didn't do it.
