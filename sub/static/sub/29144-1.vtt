00:39.720 --> 00:41.677
Would you like me to tell you a story?

00:41.760 --> 00:42.760
Hmm?

00:42.840 --> 00:45.753
What, a Bobo and Jojo story?

00:45.840 --> 00:49.436
Uh, no, I was not planning
on telling you a story

00:49.520 --> 00:52.433
about the enduring characters
of Bobo and Jojo,

00:52.520 --> 00:55.991
but you could mention their names

00:56.080 --> 00:57.992
with a little bit of respect.

00:58.120 --> 01:00.396
I mean, you might be too old for them now,

01:00.480 --> 01:02.278
but there was a time
when you were insatiable

01:02.360 --> 01:04.316
for a good Bobo and Jojo story.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.550
Well, I am sated.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.075
Well, that's fine,
because it's not about them.

01:08.160 --> 01:10.152
This is... is a new story.

01:11.040 --> 01:16.957
A new story about a young girl...

01:17.040 --> 01:18.633
Don't make it about me.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.995
I am not making it about you.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.912
It's about a young girl...

01:23.040 --> 01:25.714
fox named "Jamie."

01:26.560 --> 01:27.596
- Dad.
- What?

01:27.680 --> 01:30.434
That's the girl from the mountain book,
I told you.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.759
Okay, this is about a...
this is a... this is the story

01:35.840 --> 01:39.436
about a young girl fox named...

01:40.840 --> 01:41.840
Goldy.

01:43.400 --> 01:47.189
And she had a husband,
because she was a grown-up fox

01:47.280 --> 01:50.159
and her husband's name was, uh...

01:51.960 --> 01:53.838
was Art,

01:53.920 --> 01:57.357
and they were grown-ups,
so they lived together in a little hole.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.238
And... Their foxhole.

02:00.560 --> 02:05.635
And Art was kind of a tinkerer,
a scientist, an inventor,

02:05.720 --> 02:07.359
a futzer and fiddler,

02:07.480 --> 02:10.279
and he liked everything
to be very clean and neat in the hole.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.359
He was very fastidious
about this and that little thing.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.432
And, uh, he liked quiet time in the hole.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.638
And so... And Goldy was very...

02:19.800 --> 02:21.200
you know, very tough and outdoorsy.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.536
So it was very, very different...

02:22.560 --> 02:23.960
Dad, I said don't make it about me.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.799
I'm not making it about you.
It's about a fox named Goldy.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.918
Well, I'm tough and outdoorsy.
You say that all the time.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.480
Okay. So what?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.756
So this is about a fox, named Goldy,
in a foxhole.

02:33.880 --> 02:34.880
That's not you.

02:36.120 --> 02:40.558
So, one day,
Art took one of his inventions.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.239
It was a weather-predicting machine,

02:42.320 --> 02:44.994
and he took it up to...
on top of a mountain.

02:45.880 --> 02:48.395
And he was up there,
and he was kind of messing around with it.

02:48.520 --> 02:49.896
He was trying to predict the weather.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.696
And he saw these
big storm clouds on the horizon,

02:51.720 --> 02:55.191
and the meters on his...
on his little machine were going crazy.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.357
Uh, he wasn't sure
if they were accurate or not

02:57.440 --> 02:59.480
and he started looking
at the clouds on the horizon,

02:59.560 --> 03:03.270
and... and he sees this human being
on the other mountain peak.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.512
He was in a robe and sandals,
and this long beard,

03:06.600 --> 03:11.197
and he's shouting up at the sky,
he's shouting up all... talking,

03:11.280 --> 03:12.350
and he just looks bananas.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.920
And Art was a very smart fox.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.071
He always knew when to listen
to his inside voice

03:16.160 --> 03:18.550
if something didn't seem right,
just like we talk about.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.790
Yes, yes.

03:19.880 --> 03:23.556
Um, and he took... wrapped up his machine

03:23.680 --> 03:26.320
and he went down the mountain right away
to get away from this guy.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.920
And he went back to his hole
and he wanted to tell Goldy

03:29.000 --> 03:30.960
about his findings,
because if they were accurate,

03:31.000 --> 03:33.640
it meant there was
a gigantic storm coming.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.997
And... and Art,
more than anybody, hated to...

03:37.080 --> 03:39.675
he hated to get wet and dirty,
and he hated when this...

03:39.760 --> 03:41.513
the... their foxhole flooded.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.136
Though Goldy didn't really care that much.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.496
Art hated it, that's why he invented

03:44.520 --> 03:46.591
the weather-predicting machine
in the first place.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.796
But Goldy wasn't there.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.678
So he went around looking
all over for her,

03:49.760 --> 03:51.319
and he couldn't find her anywhere.

03:51.400 --> 03:54.950
But he did notice that all these crowds
are all moving in the same direction,

03:55.040 --> 03:56.713
all these different animals.

03:56.840 --> 04:00.550
And so he went to see what was going on.
And he kinda got swept up, and he...

04:00.640 --> 04:03.439
he followed them all down to the bay.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.592
And there in the water, huge wooden raft,

04:06.680 --> 04:08.319
really, really big.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.676
And, uh, he thought...

04:12.880 --> 04:16.351
"Oh, that thing
is not really built that well."

04:17.720 --> 04:20.154
And just as he was thinking that,

04:20.279 --> 04:22.556
he was sort of swept up
in the next crowd of people,

04:22.640 --> 04:24.950
and he got jostled around,
and bumped up, boom,

04:25.040 --> 04:26.315
right up against Goldy.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.394
There she was and he said, um,
"Where have you been?"

04:30.480 --> 04:33.314
She said,
"I've been in line for four hours!"

04:33.400 --> 04:36.871
And he said... She hated lines.
And he said, "In line for what?"

04:36.960 --> 04:39.270
She said, "In a line for the competition."

04:39.360 --> 04:41.272
And he said, "What competition?"

04:41.360 --> 04:45.479
And she said, "The best male and female
of each species, of each kind of animal..."

04:45.560 --> 04:47.392
I know what a species is.

04:47.480 --> 04:51.190
"...gets to go on an adventure
on that big giant boat,

04:51.280 --> 04:52.509
Noah's ark."

04:52.600 --> 04:54.193
This isn't how Noah's ark goes.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.670
Well, this is my story.

04:56.760 --> 04:57.955
Called "Noah's ark"?

04:58.040 --> 05:01.397
Well, it's not about Noah's ark,
but Noah's ark happens to be in my story.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.153
But this is called "Art's ark."

05:04.360 --> 05:06.033
So he doesn't wanna be left behind,

05:06.120 --> 05:09.272
not because he loves adventures,
but he loves Goldy very much

05:09.360 --> 05:11.272
and he knows
that just spending time with her

05:11.360 --> 05:15.400
is the way to keep their marriage going.

05:15.480 --> 05:19.156
So he enters the competition,
but he's no good.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.913
Instantly, he gets beaten.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.755
Um, because the things
that they are having the male foxes do

05:24.840 --> 05:26.957
are all about who's got
the biggest muscles,

05:27.040 --> 05:29.999
who's got the shiniest hair or fur,
that kind of stuff,

05:30.080 --> 05:31.240
who's got the sharpest fangs,

05:31.320 --> 05:33.312
and that's not really Art's thing.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.550
So he loses.

05:34.640 --> 05:38.600
And Goldy is marched off
with another male fox,

05:38.680 --> 05:40.273
and all the other animals, two by two,

05:40.400 --> 05:42.631
onto Noah's ark.

05:42.720 --> 05:43.790
What's his name?

05:43.880 --> 05:47.715
His name was Fang.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.792
And he's sharpened one of his little,

05:49.880 --> 05:53.191
little teeth to make it look
like a snarling sharp fang.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.877
So a bunch of humans march
all the animals on.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.391
And... including Fang and Goldy,
and they're all on the boat,

06:01.480 --> 06:03.153
and then a man walks out, a human,

06:03.240 --> 06:05.550
the same one that had been
on the top of the mountain,

06:05.640 --> 06:06.869
and he says...

06:06.960 --> 06:09.680
"G'day, folks, I'm Noah.

06:09.760 --> 06:12.195
How are you?"
"How are you? Good day.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.873
G'day, folks. How are you?"

06:13.960 --> 06:16.560
And people were just staring,
all the animals were staring at him.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.831
He keeps saying,
"How are you? Good day, g'day.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.434
Hey, good on you."

06:21.680 --> 06:24.832
He says,
"Hey, you are the chosen ones, all right?"

06:24.920 --> 06:27.515
"Take you out to the chosen ones' farm.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.672
Goin' to the farm where all
the chosen ones are. G'day. How are you?"

06:30.760 --> 06:32.831
"How are you? G'day."

06:32.920 --> 06:34.718
He gets on.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.598
And then he goes down below,

06:36.680 --> 06:39.479
and the boat starts
to drift off from the shore.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.000
And Art's standing there, miserable,

06:41.040 --> 06:43.475
watching Goldy leave,
and Goldy blows him a kiss,

06:43.560 --> 06:45.279
"I'll be back in a week!

06:45.360 --> 06:47.397
I'll see you in a week, I love you!"

06:49.360 --> 06:50.760
Boom!

06:50.840 --> 06:52.513
Clap of thunder, flash of lightning,

06:52.640 --> 06:55.280
the sky opens up,
and just rain comes out of nowhere,

06:55.360 --> 06:57.113
drenching him, he's soaked.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.475
He hates being wet.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.440
He mopes back to his foxhole,
lays down miserable,

07:02.520 --> 07:04.080
he falls asleep, and he has this dream,

07:04.160 --> 07:07.471
and in the dream,
Goldy's on the deck of the boat,

07:07.560 --> 07:10.951
and the boat's being tossed around,

07:11.040 --> 07:14.397
and she's yelling, "Help! Help!"

07:14.480 --> 07:18.030
And Art wakes up,
and his hole is full of water,

07:18.120 --> 07:20.430
water sloshing all around,
and he goes, "Help!"

07:20.520 --> 07:24.150
- He yells "help," himself, out loud.
- And he jumps out of the hole.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.816
He sees that the whole valley's flooded.
It's like a giant mudslide.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.912
And he realizes that Noah must have read...

07:30.000 --> 07:31.480
predicted the weather too.

07:31.560 --> 07:34.632
He didn't make some fun cruise,
he was making a life raft.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.915
And that everyone who was left behind
was gonna die.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.674
But Art was the only one

07:41.760 --> 07:44.275
who knew this second bit of information,

07:44.400 --> 07:46.073
that that boat was not made that well

07:46.160 --> 07:48.197
and everyone on Noah's ark
was gonna die too

07:48.320 --> 07:49.640
because it was gonna fall apart.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.871
And so he knew there was
only one thing for him to do.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.997
He had to make his own ark.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.275
- Art's ark.
- Art's ark!

07:57.240 --> 07:58.799
Art's ark.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.395
So he gets... He can't do it alone,

08:01.480 --> 08:03.949
so he gets his old friend the beaver...

08:04.960 --> 08:06.235
Bob the Beaver.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.358
And Bob is kind of an old... He was
an old beaver, he'd been around forever.

08:09.440 --> 08:12.638
And his story's amazing,
which I'll tell you another night.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.991
Bob's incredible. Genius.

08:15.080 --> 08:19.199
And so he gets Bob the Beaver,
and they build this boat,

08:19.280 --> 08:20.714
they build Art's ark together.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.656
And they even put this other thing on it

08:23.680 --> 08:25.717
which is this big wooden piece
of... a mast,

08:25.800 --> 08:27.519
and they weave these palm fronds together

08:27.600 --> 08:30.115
so it catches the wind
and makes them move much faster.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.759
- A sail.
- A sail!

08:31.840 --> 08:34.719
They put the first... they build...
They make the first sail.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.359
Art invented the sail!

08:37.880 --> 08:39.234
Art was amazing.

08:39.320 --> 08:43.030
So, it zooms up really quickly
and it catches Noah's ark.

08:44.159 --> 08:47.631
And sure enough, it's being tossed,
taking on water, it's...

08:47.720 --> 08:49.393
it's basically about to fall apart.

08:49.480 --> 08:52.552
And the sharks are circling,
and their mouths are salivating.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.950
They can't wait to eat all those animals.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.191
And all the animals on Noah's ark
are panicking.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.511
And there's land on the horizon,

08:59.640 --> 09:01.616
but Noah just can't steer there,
'cause he didn't put a...

09:01.640 --> 09:03.632
he didn't put a rudder on,
he didn't do anything.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.997
I mean that was... Art's a real...
he's an artist, a craftsman.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.117
I mean, he built the thing.
You know what I mean?

09:09.200 --> 09:13.752
And, uh, Noah's was just
a floating bunch of planks,

09:13.840 --> 09:15.399
and they were coming apart.

09:15.480 --> 09:19.269
And so, quickly,
Art throws a lasso around the, uh...

09:19.360 --> 09:21.317
the bow of Noah's ark,

09:21.400 --> 09:24.598
pops the sail, pulls them out
of the eye of the storm,

09:24.680 --> 09:26.034
onto the land.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.634
All the animals get off.

09:27.720 --> 09:30.315
And, you know, Noah walks out too.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.791
He goes...
"I've saved ya. See that? I saved ya."

09:33.880 --> 09:36.120
He goes, "I've saved you all.
You're all my children now.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.231
G'day. How are ya? How are ya? G'day."

09:39.520 --> 09:41.512
And Art doesn't care
if he takes the credit.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.712
He just wanted to be with Goldy,
save everyone's life,

09:44.800 --> 09:47.336
he saves the whole animal kingdom,
and he doesn't take any credit.

09:47.360 --> 09:50.478
He just walks off and makes a new foxhole,

09:50.560 --> 09:52.597
uh, with Goldy.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.976
And he's so happy to be back with her.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.472
And she never questioned
his devices after that.

09:58.560 --> 10:02.679
And he always let her, you know,
make a bit of a mess in the hole.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.320
They really appreciated each other
more after this.

10:05.400 --> 10:10.236
And... and also, from then on,
foxes, uh, were not known

10:10.320 --> 10:13.870
for being, you know, having beefy muscles

10:13.960 --> 10:16.350
and long, flowy fox hair.

10:16.440 --> 10:20.354
They were known for being clever
and courageous animals.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.555
The end.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.717
You said it was gonna be about Goldy,
and then it was about Art.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.996
Yeah, well, Goldy's story is just...
is more complicated.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.639
And that's a whole other story.

10:48.160 --> 10:52.154
Was there really two of every species?

10:52.240 --> 10:53.913
'Cause that seems unlikely.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.992
That does seem unlikely.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.912
I can't believe I missed that.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.832
What a bunch of bunk.

11:04.880 --> 11:08.112
He must have made that whole thing up
about Noah's ark.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.520
Unlikely.

11:11.840 --> 11:15.436
Well, sometimes stories
are made up, right?

11:16.440 --> 11:17.476
That's right.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.992
Some stories are just made up.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.756
I'm the only girl of my species.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.118
No, you're not.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.839
There are others.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.752
I'm the only one I ever saw.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.590
Mmm...

11:43.240 --> 11:45.709
Yeah, well, you'll get older,
and there'll be more,

11:45.800 --> 11:47.234
and you'll meet them.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.596
And would they know I'm a girl?

11:53.920 --> 11:55.718
Well, they'll know if you let them know.

13:18.800 --> 13:19.870
Rag?

13:21.240 --> 13:22.560
Rag?

13:22.640 --> 13:23.915
What?

13:25.040 --> 13:26.110
What are you doing?

13:27.280 --> 13:28.509
I'm reading.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.755
Alligator.

13:59.840 --> 14:03.993
A-L-L-I-G-A-T-O-R.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.992
Okay. Charcoal.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.878
- Seriously?
- Too easy?

14:07.960 --> 14:09.076
Yes, it's charcoal.

14:09.200 --> 14:11.317
Okay, relax. Too easy.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.960
Uh, narcissistic.

14:14.080 --> 14:18.916
N-A-R-C-I-S-S-I-S-T-I-C.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.912
Wow, that's pretty good.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.674
Centrifugal. Centrifugal.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.520
Centrifugal.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.760
- Dad.
- What?

14:29.840 --> 14:32.355
What's the difference
between morals and ethics?

14:33.440 --> 14:36.831
Well, a moral's an idea...
hmm, about right and wrong.

14:38.280 --> 14:42.399
And ethics are how those morals apply
to specific situations,

14:42.480 --> 14:45.314
like it's wrong to kill someone,

14:45.400 --> 14:48.438
but if they're gonna
kill ten other people,

14:48.520 --> 14:49.749
is it okay to kill him?

14:49.840 --> 14:52.799
I don't know why I use killing
as an example, it's very...

14:52.880 --> 14:54.599
Pretty violent, but it's kind of an...

14:55.960 --> 14:59.670
uh, obvious moral.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.189
This... this guy Luke, in my book,

15:07.280 --> 15:11.399
he has really bad morals and ethics.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.631
- Both.
- Huh.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.632
How is he immoral and unethical?

15:17.200 --> 15:19.954
'Cause he's really bad.

15:20.040 --> 15:23.192
He lies to protect himself,
and then he doesn't lie

15:23.280 --> 15:26.432
when he could lie
to not break Lilly's heart.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.318
I understand that.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.040
What do you think he would say
to defend his own choices?

15:33.480 --> 15:34.914
Um...

15:36.280 --> 15:39.910
Uh, well, maybe he feels bad
about lying the first time.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.874
And so he doesn't lie the second time,

15:43.960 --> 15:46.919
even though that would be the right ethic.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.830
Uh-huh.

15:48.920 --> 15:53.995
So he would defend
his choice by saying

15:54.080 --> 15:58.199
that he learned lying was wrong,
so now he wants to always tell the truth.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.195
Okay.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.176
So he would be right morally
but not ethically.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.395
Eat these.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.120
Hey, get down.

16:26.200 --> 16:27.200
Stay here.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.350
- Why?
- Because I said so.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.079
- Stay here.
- Okay.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.874
- Can I help you, sir?
- Oh, Jesus.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.555
I heard some noises from over a ways.

16:46.640 --> 16:49.917
I see. This is my camp.
These are my things.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.390
I didn't know anyone
was back in this part.

16:52.480 --> 16:55.200
I'm not really back here,
I'm just passing through.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.600
Uh-huh.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.376
It's just me and an old army buddy
of mine. He's hunting at the moment.

16:59.400 --> 17:00.595
Uh-huh.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.952
- Can I help you?
- No.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.952
No, I... I'm just pokin' around.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.675
Uh-huh.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.599
And who have we here?

17:16.400 --> 17:18.471
That's my s... This is my son.

17:18.560 --> 17:19.800
Oh, what's your name?

17:19.839 --> 17:20.990
My son, Alex.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.079
Alex.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.560
And how old are you?

17:23.640 --> 17:24.640
- Eleven.
- Just, uh...

17:24.720 --> 17:25.856
- Eleven!
- Yeah, 11.

17:25.880 --> 17:27.359
Well, what are you reading?

17:29.400 --> 17:30.400
Just a book.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.755
It looks good.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.356
Comely boy.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.075
Thanks.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.832
We aren't looking
for any more company, sir.

17:44.840 --> 17:45.840
Yeah, I bet.

17:47.920 --> 17:51.197
Well, I will be on my way then.

17:57.360 --> 18:01.513
Oh, if I see your buddy, I will say hello.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.800
I told you to stay hiding.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.600
Pack your things.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.437
- Are we moving?
- Yes.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.000
- Now?
- Yes.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.793
- 'Cause of him?
- Yes.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.473
He's a doddering old man.

18:25.440 --> 18:27.238
Him and everyone he knows.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.669
Is this a red alert?

18:31.000 --> 18:33.231
No, but I would like to move
sort of quickly.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.256
Why didn't you say I was your son
like we usually do?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.475
I did say you were my son.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.536
Instead of making me hide
and saying you had a buddy?

18:38.560 --> 18:41.997
Okay, Rag, I'll give you an answer to that
when I have some time to think about it.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.878
Right now,
I need you to gather your things.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.296
Rag, I don't know why you came
out of your hiding spot.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.640
You've never done that before.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.960
You've got to listen to my instructions
when I give them.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.831
- Rag?
- Okay.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.560
Now, the answer to your question...

18:56.600 --> 18:59.399
Well, when you asked me the question,
I said, you know,

18:59.480 --> 19:01.392
"Because I said so," and that's not kind,

19:01.480 --> 19:03.392
it's unfair,
you deserve to have an answer.

19:03.480 --> 19:06.234
And I should have given you an answer,
but I couldn't in that moment.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.874
It's okay.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.673
I knew why.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.080
The man?

19:12.160 --> 19:13.833
Yes, the man.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.118
But... Well, yes, the man. Period.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.398
But, anyway, the... the answer to your q...

19:20.480 --> 19:23.473
Rag? Rag?
How do you know where you're going?

19:23.560 --> 19:24.789
Northwest.

19:24.880 --> 19:26.376
I know which direction
we're supposed to be going,

19:26.400 --> 19:28.676
but how do you know
which direction northwest is?

19:28.760 --> 19:30.536
'Cause you told me
a million times and it's really easy...

19:30.560 --> 19:32.256
But if you're looking at your book,
and you're walking,

19:32.280 --> 19:33.714
and you're trying to listen to me,

19:33.800 --> 19:35.496
how do you know you're gonna go
in the right direction?

19:35.520 --> 19:38.536
'Cause it's not that hard to read,
listen, and walk in a straight line.

19:38.560 --> 19:40.472
Really? Okay, show me your compass.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.673
Okay, fine.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.240
Do you think that man was immoral?

20:06.320 --> 20:10.633
Immoral? Um, maybe, but... I don't know.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.792
I don't know him, so I don't know,
and our rule is better safe than sorry.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.954
Well, I don't know anybody.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.032
What do you mean you don't know anybody?

20:22.440 --> 20:23.999
I don't know anybody.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.235
All I know is you.

20:26.320 --> 20:29.074
Well, you knew that...
those boys at the barn

20:29.160 --> 20:30.719
and you knew their father.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.000
Not really.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.594
What do you mean "not really"?

20:35.680 --> 20:37.717
Well, we only knew them for three days.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.440
Well...

20:40.240 --> 20:42.550
Yeah. But, uh...

20:45.200 --> 20:46.680
I mean, well...

20:49.000 --> 20:50.036
you know me.

20:51.560 --> 20:54.519
I don't know what more
you could possibly ask for.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.838
Do you know how much I love you?

21:07.360 --> 21:08.510
To the sun and back.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.195
To the sun and back 30,000 times.

21:11.280 --> 21:14.717
And it's not even our sun.
It's a sun in a distant galaxy.

21:14.800 --> 21:18.760
And we're taking a very slow spaceship.
It takes a very, very long time.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.234
And there's a lot of headwind.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.395
It's quite a trip.

21:24.560 --> 21:26.040
How much do you love me?

21:29.000 --> 21:31.959
Like, to the top of a tree.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
What?

21:38.560 --> 21:39.835
What?

21:39.920 --> 21:41.673
And... and back down.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.559
- Dad?
- Yeah, I'm here.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.233
My stomach hurts a little.

23:16.040 --> 23:18.396
Here, can you drink this?

23:20.400 --> 23:22.278
Charcoal? Yeah.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.312
You know, there's a reason
that vomit smells bad.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.275
What we ate?

23:32.480 --> 23:34.915
Uh, well, no, not exactly.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.878
That's part, but I just...

23:36.960 --> 23:38.872
The reason is so that other people

23:38.960 --> 23:42.271
won't go near it and they won't get sick.

23:43.520 --> 23:44.954
That's evolution at work.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.318
Am I gonna die?

23:48.400 --> 23:51.199
No, babe, you always say that,
and you always get better.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.320
You're not gonna die.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.317
Do I have the plague?

24:00.400 --> 24:01.880
No, you don't have the plague.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.310
Do you remember
when I explained immunity to you?

24:04.400 --> 24:05.720
You're immune.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.056
If you were gonna get the plague,

24:07.080 --> 24:09.356
you would have had it
when you were very, very little.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.416
And people vomit for all kinds of reasons,

24:12.440 --> 24:15.638
and all it means is that your body
is doing what it's supposed to do.

24:18.800 --> 24:24.478
I mean, but you got
to get rid of it in the bowl

24:24.560 --> 24:27.234
and not in the tent.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.397
So when you feel like you're gonna vomit,

24:29.480 --> 24:33.076
you have to say,
"I need the bowl, I need the bowl."

24:34.240 --> 24:35.879
Or else get outside.

24:48.640 --> 24:50.120
She's asleep.

24:50.200 --> 24:52.271
No rash, no fever, nothing.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.756
Babe, I don't think
that you should just give up.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.196
It's not giving up, it's just letting go.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.760
Okay.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.194
Well, I don't want you to let go.

25:01.280 --> 25:04.193
Well, I don't wanna die on a cot
in an overcrowded field hospital

25:04.280 --> 25:07.114
being treated to
by volunteers with no cure.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.157
You don't know that.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.152
You don't know that's what's gonna happen.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.715
Can we check it out?

26:21.800 --> 26:23.837
No, somebody could be living there.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.280
Really?

26:27.240 --> 26:29.232
Yes, really.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.474
Doesn't look like it.

26:36.280 --> 26:37.873
There's vines all over it.

26:39.200 --> 26:40.316
Please?

27:33.280 --> 27:34.475
Hello!

28:33.880 --> 28:36.554
Wait here. Take your whistle out.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.915
Okay.

29:18.120 --> 29:20.237
Okay, take off your pack.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.115
You can go up.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.839
There's bedrooms with beds.

30:29.920 --> 30:30.956
I know.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.115
Look at this.

30:36.080 --> 30:37.480
VoilÃ !

30:37.560 --> 30:40.234
This is better than the barn
and the greenhouse.

30:40.320 --> 30:41.959
- You think so?
- Mm-hmm.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.070
Can we stay?

30:49.200 --> 30:50.953
No, this is somebody else's house.

30:51.040 --> 30:52.394
Well, so was the greenhouse.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.073
Not really.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.072
But, Dad, no one's using it.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.317
Rag, I know it would be nice
to be in a house again.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.552
But a house is a place that other people
come to eventually, especially...

31:05.640 --> 31:06.676
So what? It's fine.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.712
...a house like this. It's not fine.

31:11.000 --> 31:14.118
It's just as fine as in the woods.
We saw that guy in the woods...

31:14.200 --> 31:16.816
- It's more likely someone comes across...
- And that was in the middle of nowhere.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.275
It's just as likely that someone
finds us camping there.

31:19.360 --> 31:22.016
We don't know if that man followed us
or if he told someone about us.

31:22.040 --> 31:24.350
- Well, why would he?
- Because he knew.

31:27.160 --> 31:30.995
Also, this is closer to town, which means
that it's closer to other people.

31:31.080 --> 31:33.276
I don't think it's a safe place to be.

31:34.120 --> 31:37.830
Well, we won't be any farther away
from the town if we make a camp.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.631
It is more likely
that someone comes here...

31:45.680 --> 31:48.036
than to some random place in the woods

31:48.120 --> 31:50.191
where we put a tent,
because this is a house.

31:50.280 --> 31:53.671
I'm not gonna be surprised by people
like we were at the greenhouse.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.715
Dad, the house is covered in dust.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.871
That means that no one ever comes here.

32:03.040 --> 32:07.432
If they did,
we could be carefully prepared for it,

32:07.520 --> 32:11.514
and we could leave immediately
like we always do, with the red alert.

32:12.720 --> 32:18.318
And we can play hide-and-seek inside.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.869
And name the different rooms
like at the pond house.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.396
Okay.

32:43.760 --> 32:46.559
- Well, we can stay for a few days.
- For a few days?

32:46.640 --> 32:50.395
- Yeah, for a few days or not at all.
- Okay, fine, for a few days.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.634
- Dad.
- What?

32:56.720 --> 32:58.680
- Did you see that room upstairs?
- Yes, I saw it.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.336
The one with the toys and everything?

33:00.360 --> 33:02.079
I saw it.

34:54.480 --> 34:55.675
Hi.

34:57.800 --> 35:01.840
You are awesome. You are awesome.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.352
Oh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

35:36.680 --> 35:37.680
Rag?

35:39.120 --> 35:40.270
Rag?

35:41.960 --> 35:44.395
Get your emergency bag,
I'll show you the safe spot.

35:46.640 --> 35:47.640
Hey, Rag.

35:49.240 --> 35:51.152
It all fits.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.595
Wow.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.314
Take that off. Take it off.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.073
Come downstairs.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.072
I wasn't even leaving the room.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.440
Are you kidding me?

36:20.760 --> 36:23.070
Did I just tell you
to take all those clothes off?

36:24.480 --> 36:25.755
Do you think it's a joke?

36:27.640 --> 36:30.109
Rag, I know new clothes are exciting,

36:30.200 --> 36:32.080
but you should know better
than to put those on.

36:32.160 --> 36:34.436
- It's just a jacket.
- It's not just a jacket!

36:35.640 --> 36:37.950
It's got sparkly things all over it!

36:50.960 --> 36:52.553
Rag, hurry up.

36:58.400 --> 36:59.595
Are you sulking?

37:01.120 --> 37:02.600
Are you gonna sulk?

37:04.280 --> 37:06.192
Put it in the hiding spot.

37:17.160 --> 37:21.598
Okay, so where's the emergency bag?

37:21.680 --> 37:23.876
- There.
- And where's there?

37:23.960 --> 37:25.394
In the fallen tree.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.951
Sure are a lot of fallen trees
around here.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.519
What side of the house is it on?

37:33.360 --> 37:34.840
The kitchen side.

39:25.240 --> 39:27.232
What? What? What?

39:27.320 --> 39:29.118
- Dad!
- What, what, what?

39:29.200 --> 39:30.554
Tell me! What?

39:42.680 --> 39:44.239
Is that a child?

39:46.560 --> 39:49.997
I think it's a mother and a daughter,
but it's hard to tell.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.230
All right.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.794
She's my size.

39:57.880 --> 39:59.473
Don't look at them too much.

39:59.560 --> 40:00.755
It's okay.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.637
Hi. Want some water?

40:45.040 --> 40:46.235
Yes.

40:59.440 --> 41:00.999
What are you thinkin'?

41:04.160 --> 41:06.072
When do you think they died?

41:06.160 --> 41:07.719
Seven or eight years ago.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.513
How old would the kid be?

41:12.680 --> 41:14.592
Maybe 18 years old.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.794
They were like...

41:20.800 --> 41:22.075
skeletons.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.953
They were like skeletons.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.711
But that won't be us anytime soon.

41:30.640 --> 41:31.869
How do you know?

41:33.040 --> 41:37.432
Well, because... we're not gonna get sick.

41:38.480 --> 41:40.756
And because we have long lives to live.

41:44.760 --> 41:48.913
Then why do we have to have
all the red alerts and...

41:49.000 --> 41:51.196
Just because people
aren't getting sick anymore

41:51.320 --> 41:54.233
doesn't mean that the world
is completely...

41:55.680 --> 41:56.750
right again.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.080
When will it be right again?

42:03.920 --> 42:05.354
When it's balanced.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.319
When will it be balanced?

42:10.480 --> 42:12.073
When there are more women.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.912
Why can't men keep it balanced?

42:18.240 --> 42:21.677
'Cause they were scared,
and sad, and lonely,

42:21.760 --> 42:24.559
and that made them angry,
and when they were angry,

42:24.640 --> 42:28.600
they lost sight of everything
that was important and good in life.

42:31.440 --> 42:33.238
What's important and good in life?

42:35.400 --> 42:37.471
Well, it's different for everybody.

42:39.800 --> 42:45.319
But I think that love
is most important and good.

42:45.400 --> 42:48.393
Loving other people,
and letting them love you, and...

42:50.520 --> 42:52.352
I think stories are important and good

42:52.440 --> 42:55.319
because they connect us to other people,

42:55.400 --> 42:58.472
and they make the world
seem like a bigger place.

42:59.400 --> 43:00.914
And they're fun to tell.

43:02.440 --> 43:06.514
But not all men are sad,
and lonely, and angry.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.239
No, not all men.

43:09.480 --> 43:13.793
But we don't know who,
it's hard to tell who, so...

43:13.880 --> 43:15.599
We stay away.

43:15.680 --> 43:19.230
Yep, but just for now, not forever.

43:19.320 --> 43:21.152
And you know what?

43:21.240 --> 43:22.993
I kind of like it, just you and me.

43:25.720 --> 43:27.200
Yeah, me too.

43:42.560 --> 43:43.560
Are we leaving?

43:44.440 --> 43:45.590
Hi.

43:51.760 --> 43:52.760
No.

43:53.760 --> 43:55.353
So, we're staying?

43:55.440 --> 43:57.511
We can stay a little bit longer.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.592
- Then what are you doing?
- I'm storing.

43:59.680 --> 44:00.830
Why?

44:00.920 --> 44:03.000
We don't leave our belongings
sitting around at camp.

44:03.040 --> 44:05.236
We're not gonna leave 'em
sitting around in the house.

44:06.960 --> 44:09.395
So get your belongings together.

44:12.040 --> 44:14.077
Put them in storage, get your day pack.

44:15.840 --> 44:17.911
And please put on your own clothes.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.469
- Where are we going?
- We're going to town.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.436
- Really?
- Yes.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.239
Are we going all the way to the shed?

44:25.320 --> 44:26.436
No.

44:26.520 --> 44:28.637
- The library?
- If we can.

44:28.720 --> 44:31.030
If we aren't going to the library,
I wanna stay here.

44:31.120 --> 44:35.637
Rag, please put on your town hat
and take off the jacket.

44:36.440 --> 44:39.990
I'm not walking there,
and I'm not wearing that stupid hat.

44:40.080 --> 44:42.056
You know,
there are some things you get to decide

44:42.080 --> 44:43.992
and there are some things that you don't.

44:44.080 --> 44:45.480
Well, what do I decide?

44:45.560 --> 44:47.576
You get to decide what kinda attitude
you're gonna have

44:47.600 --> 44:49.831
when you have to do things
that you don't wanna do.

46:07.960 --> 46:09.155
He's young.

46:09.240 --> 46:11.960
Yeah, he was just a newborn
when it happened.

46:13.320 --> 46:15.551
Well, it's nice
to see a little guy around.

46:15.640 --> 46:16.640
Uh-huh.

46:16.720 --> 46:19.030
Probably not the youngest anymore.

46:19.120 --> 46:22.192
They're making little girl babies
in a laboratory in California.

46:22.280 --> 46:24.590
Probably a lot more in China.

46:24.680 --> 46:27.479
Hey, you like little yellow China dolls?

46:28.720 --> 46:30.598
Is that a "no"? You're shy, aren't you?

46:30.680 --> 46:33.216
He hasn't made up his mind yet.
Thank you very much.

46:33.240 --> 46:34.310
No worries.

47:58.320 --> 47:59.595
How tall am I?

48:01.000 --> 48:02.673
Hmm, seven or eight feet.

48:03.840 --> 48:04.956
Really.

48:05.840 --> 48:07.320
Four feet, nine inches.

48:09.680 --> 48:11.751
My legs aren't long enough.

48:11.840 --> 48:13.911
Well, what makes you say that?

48:14.000 --> 48:16.560
A woman's legs are supposed
to be half her body length.

48:17.360 --> 48:18.430
Uh, what?

48:18.520 --> 48:19.920
That's what it said in the news.

48:20.040 --> 48:21.440
What news?

48:21.520 --> 48:22.670
This.

48:27.280 --> 48:29.158
Did you get this from the library?

48:29.240 --> 48:30.515
Yeah.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.990
Those magazines are full of lies, kid.

48:33.080 --> 48:36.869
They lie about who people are
and what they're supposed to be like.

48:36.960 --> 48:38.360
But it said "scientists say."

48:38.440 --> 48:39.896
Anybody can call themself a scientist,

48:39.920 --> 48:42.913
and anyone can write anything
they want in a magazine.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.799
Do you know how long a woman's legs
are really supposed to be?

48:45.880 --> 48:48.111
- How long?
- Long enough to reach the ground.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.549
Do your legs reach the ground?

48:51.640 --> 48:52.640
Yeah.

48:54.480 --> 48:55.914
Well, then they're perfect.

49:06.160 --> 49:08.320
When we were in town
and that man asked you a question,

49:08.360 --> 49:10.238
did you know what he was talking about?

49:12.280 --> 49:13.316
Sort of.

49:21.560 --> 49:23.677
Babies aren't grown in laboratories.

49:34.960 --> 49:36.838
They are made, uh...

49:38.120 --> 49:40.191
when a man and a woman,

49:40.280 --> 49:42.590
who love each other,

49:42.680 --> 49:45.514
uh, put their bodies together
in a special way

49:45.600 --> 49:47.717
and it makes the woman pregnant.

49:47.800 --> 49:48.995
Sex.

49:52.920 --> 49:54.639
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

49:59.640 --> 50:01.757
Was that something
that you read about in a book?

50:01.840 --> 50:03.672
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

50:05.280 --> 50:07.576
I feel like I should be reading
the books that you're reading,

50:07.600 --> 50:09.478
so I know what kinds of things
you're learning,

50:09.560 --> 50:11.816
because I didn't think that you were
reading books about things like that...

50:11.840 --> 50:12.990
It's fine.

50:14.600 --> 50:15.875
Okay, well...

50:17.000 --> 50:18.480
Did this book, uh...

50:21.320 --> 50:25.439
Anyway, uh, it's just science.

50:25.520 --> 50:28.558
So I'll just explain it,
because it's not that big of a deal.

50:28.640 --> 50:33.590
So, uh, babies are made by,
uh, men and women who are in love.

50:33.680 --> 50:36.559
And they, uh, put their bodies together

50:36.640 --> 50:38.996
in a special way,
'cause they're all grown up.

50:39.080 --> 50:43.393
And, um, that results in a baby

50:43.480 --> 50:45.949
growing in the woman's belly.

50:53.320 --> 50:58.031
And a baby grows for 40 weeks or so

50:58.120 --> 51:00.794
in, uh, a womb.

51:00.880 --> 51:02.519
Uh, it's called a "womb,"

51:02.600 --> 51:05.434
which is a nice safe place
for a baby to grow.

51:05.520 --> 51:08.080
Uh, and that's in a woman's belly.

51:08.160 --> 51:14.316
And then it comes out
of her, uh, vagina, and, um...

51:17.080 --> 51:20.152
Um, so those are body parts
that you have too.

51:20.240 --> 51:23.472
Uh, but you're a child,
and so they're different.

51:23.600 --> 51:27.116
And they'll... uh, until you're older,
and you grow up,

51:27.200 --> 51:29.556
and those body parts will change, uh,

51:29.640 --> 51:33.156
in a phase of your life
that's called, uh, "puberty."

51:33.240 --> 51:34.754
And, um...

51:36.400 --> 51:38.056
It might feel funny
when you're growing a lot.

51:38.080 --> 51:39.799
It makes your body, uh, change a lot.

51:39.880 --> 51:42.634
But it's totally normal,
and everyone goes through it,

51:42.720 --> 51:43.836
and it's very safe.

51:45.520 --> 51:47.796
And, so...

51:49.440 --> 51:53.434
what that man was saying
about yellow China dolls

51:53.520 --> 51:55.000
is that, you know, he was saying

51:55.080 --> 51:56.976
"young Chinese girls,"
that's what he was saying.

51:57.000 --> 52:00.789
Sometimes people will talk about
the color of other people's skin...

52:00.880 --> 52:02.837
in a way that is sort of
putting them down...

52:03.840 --> 52:06.480
or just out of habit, uh, or both.

52:06.600 --> 52:10.833
Um, and it's one way
that people have of being mean

52:10.920 --> 52:15.199
even though there is no one skin color
that's any better than another skin color.

52:15.280 --> 52:18.876
Uh, or they'll say about girls,
they'll call them "dolls,"

52:18.960 --> 52:21.873
like they're just little dolls
in a doll house,

52:21.960 --> 52:23.394
not human beings.

52:23.480 --> 52:25.836
Uh, and it's a way of putting girls down

52:25.920 --> 52:29.880
without, uh, well, sort of while
you're pretending to be nice.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.434
Um...

52:31.520 --> 52:33.193
So that's what that was about.

52:37.400 --> 52:40.871
And one more thing about puberty,
uh, also,

52:40.960 --> 52:45.079
is just that, uh, it...
that happens when you're, uh,

52:45.160 --> 52:47.436
you sort of get like a, uh...

52:48.120 --> 52:51.955
Yeah, like a sort of... like a...
you get like a, um...

52:52.040 --> 52:53.633
Well, like a little bloody nose

52:53.720 --> 52:56.713
and it comes, uh, from where you pee, uh,

52:56.800 --> 52:59.110
and that's totally normal,
and it's totally safe,

52:59.200 --> 53:01.760
and, uh, it's just not...
not happening to you yet.

53:01.840 --> 53:04.071
But you can just tell me
when that does happen to you,

53:04.200 --> 53:07.159
and, uh, you know, just so I know.

53:07.240 --> 53:10.711
Uh, and your mother had that,
and, um, it's...

53:10.800 --> 53:12.393
uh, it doesn't mean that you are hurt,

53:12.480 --> 53:15.712
it just means that your body is working
the way that it's supposed to work.

53:15.800 --> 53:18.190
So it's a sort of normal function

53:18.280 --> 53:21.512
and, uh, not a big deal.

53:54.760 --> 53:56.911
All right, drink up.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.239
Are you mad at me?

54:32.520 --> 54:34.273
No.

54:34.360 --> 54:37.319
You know I love you more
than anything in the whole world?

54:39.320 --> 54:40.800
What about Mom?

54:44.040 --> 54:45.440
I love her too.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.236
I love her a lot.

54:49.960 --> 54:52.520
How can you love someone
that you never see?

54:57.080 --> 54:58.560
That's a good question.

55:00.400 --> 55:02.278
Maybe you can miss them,
and remember them,

55:02.400 --> 55:06.076
and still love them.

55:06.160 --> 55:07.992
Well, I don't remember her.

55:09.040 --> 55:12.477
But you're connected to her still,
and you have her in your imagination.

55:14.480 --> 55:15.755
I don't.

55:15.840 --> 55:18.639
I don't have Mom in my imagination.

55:18.720 --> 55:22.714
All I have is...
is one tiny scratched-up picture.

55:22.840 --> 55:24.911
I have no idea what she's like.

55:28.720 --> 55:31.360
Rag, you had the best mom
in the whole world.

55:33.240 --> 55:34.310
The best.

55:35.080 --> 55:36.560
How was she the best?

55:38.080 --> 55:42.154
Because she loved you
more than anything.

55:42.240 --> 55:43.640
So much.

55:43.720 --> 55:44.995
She was so fun.

55:46.040 --> 55:50.398
And she could get along with anybody.

55:52.800 --> 55:54.200
How was she so fun?

55:55.480 --> 55:57.790
Well, let's see.

55:57.880 --> 55:59.519
She loved adventures.

56:01.360 --> 56:04.000
So we traveled a lot,
just like you and I do.

56:04.080 --> 56:06.993
And she only ever called it
a love adventure.

56:07.080 --> 56:09.072
Anytime we took a trip,
it was a love adventure.

56:09.160 --> 56:11.117
I'd say, "Where are we gonna go?"

56:11.200 --> 56:14.079
She'd say, "I don't know.
It's a love adventure, you and me."

56:14.880 --> 56:18.396
And then we'd go somewhere,
and it'd be the most perfect trip ever.

56:18.520 --> 56:20.318
Everything would just be perfect.

56:20.400 --> 56:22.596
And I would never want it to end.

56:22.680 --> 56:26.833
And then it would and she'd say,
"Wow. That was a love adventure."

56:26.920 --> 56:29.400
And then we'd go on a trip,
and then everything would go wrong,

56:29.480 --> 56:32.871
it'd be terribly wrong,
the worst trip you can imagine.

56:32.960 --> 56:35.395
We'd get a flat tire
just on the way there,

56:35.480 --> 56:37.915
and then break a tool
fixing the flat tire,

56:38.040 --> 56:42.239
and then broke a bone fixing the tool
fixing the flat tire.

56:43.760 --> 56:48.039
And then she would say,
"Wow. It's a love adventure, you and me."

56:57.160 --> 56:58.833
We got a flat tire once.

57:00.160 --> 57:01.992
Oh man, that was no fun.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.799
You were so mad.

57:04.640 --> 57:07.792
I was. I was frustrated.
I didn't wanna be on that road.

57:11.280 --> 57:13.511
I bet she was a better cook than you.

57:13.600 --> 57:14.600
What?

57:15.360 --> 57:16.794
- No.
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

57:16.880 --> 57:18.633
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

57:18.720 --> 57:21.474
Until you've tasted the food
cooked by your mother,

57:21.560 --> 57:24.200
you'll never know
what "inedible" really means.

57:24.280 --> 57:26.078
It's like a salt extravaganza.

57:26.160 --> 57:28.516
It's like eating a pile of salt
with your face.

57:50.320 --> 57:52.152
<i>You have to tell her about me, okay?</i>

57:52.280 --> 57:55.637
Yes.

57:55.720 --> 57:57.456
But you can't just tell her
all the good things,

57:57.480 --> 57:59.915
you're gonna have to tell her everything.

58:01.320 --> 58:03.039
- Okay?
- Okay, okay.

58:05.040 --> 58:06.997
Also, can you tell her that I love her?

58:07.080 --> 58:08.514
Of course, of course.

58:08.600 --> 58:11.513
And that I really wanted to be her mom.

58:12.720 --> 58:15.758
And I'm really sorry that I just couldn't.

59:38.160 --> 59:40.675
- Hey. Get over in there.
- What? Who is it?

59:42.160 --> 59:45.437
What? What is it?

59:50.240 --> 59:52.720
Stay in here and don't come out
until I come and get you.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.399
Yeah, what do you want?

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.199
We ran out of gas.
Do you have any?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.036
No, we don't.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.639
Can we come in for a second?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.593
For what?

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:27.796
To dry off.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.995
No, I'm sorry, my brothers are sleeping,
and they don't want anybody in the house.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.080
Hey, were you in town
with the little kid yesterday?

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.835
We don't have children.
You have the wrong house.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.920
Come on out.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.320
Come on out.

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.240
All right, go. Run.

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.713
Turn that off.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:35.479
Who were they?

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:41.916
They were just looking
for somebody else.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.117
They were looking for me
'cause I'm a girl.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.152
Yes.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.776
Then why'd you say that they
were looking for someone else?

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.080
I meant that they were looking for
someone that they thought they could take.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.232
They can't take you...

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.471
because you're...

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.593
You're careful.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.239
Where would they take me?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.311
They're not gonna take you anywhere,
because they can't find you.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.312
But where would they?

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.799
I don't know.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.231
All I know is
that they were dangerous people.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.358
But we're safe together.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.195
That's enough to know, okay?

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.720
What if someone hurt you?

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:49.436
People have hurt me.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.914
I mean like... like hurt you bad.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:02.679
Then I would stop them.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.956
And I would try not to hurt them back,
even though I'd be very mad at them.

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.759
But no matter what...

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:16.313
no one's gonna take you away, I promise.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.800
Okay?

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:24.712
What if they tied you up
and then knock you down and stab you?

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.839
Well, then I'll get up, and I'll get free,
and I'll keep being your dad.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.671
What if they kill you?

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.754
Then I'll be dead.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.480
And you'll be alive.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:49.919
Until you're dead.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.759
And then we'll be together.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:58.352
And no matter what...
I'll always be with you.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.277
Even if you can't see me,
you can't hear me...

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.279
I'm always with you.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.833
What would happen to me?

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.518
You would take very good care
of yourself and you'd be fine.

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.553
Because you're... very tough.

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:23.594
I'm tough?

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.950
You're extremely tough, yes.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.190
How?

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.280
Because you're careful
and you're persistent.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.800
That's how.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.272
And because you're smart
and you listen to your inside voice.

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.957
But I'm not tougher than grown-ups.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.749
Most grown-ups give up very easily.

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:51.400
I've known a lot of people.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.353
And if they were able to get by somehow,
then you can get by too,

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:57.636
because you're much tougher than they are.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.951
But if you die, I'll just be alone.

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.792
I am not gonna die.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.552
Nobody's gonna kill me.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:39.192
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.000
Even if someone...

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.835
tied me up and stabbed me
and knocked me down

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.877
and put me in a block of ice

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.992
and dropped me in the bottom of the ocean.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.955
I would get out,
and I would come find you.

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.510
And we'd just keep on
the way we always do.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.392
And if that sounds impossible to you...

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.312
I'm sorry, but it's true.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:14.556
But we only have one sleeping bag
and one emergency bag.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.073
Okay.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:20.915
You're worried about the things
that we left behind, right?

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.118
And you're worried about those men.

01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:29.796
You don't have to worry about those men.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.837
They're long gone.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.600
And I don't want you to think about
the stuff that we left behind.

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:36.990
I want you to think
about the stuff that we have

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.435
and how we can be
better prepared in the future.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.749
Okay?

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:43.880
Okay.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:45.399
Rag.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.636
What?

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.872
We've got a lot of walking to do.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:55.634
Where are we going?

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:58.997
You remember my grandmother's house
where I lived when I was young?

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.555
No.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:08.096
Well, that's where we're gonna go.
It's up in the mountains.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.096
They've got animals there,
and they've got sledding,

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.936
and they've got a boat with a lake,
and it's really far away from everyone.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.633
So I think it's gonna be really...

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.517
I mean, a really nice place.

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.599
How long will it take?

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:23.954
Gonna be a lot of walking.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:27.995
- How many days?
- I don't know how many days.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.239
Well, what do you think?

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.776
I think it'll be a lot of days,

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.996
but we're gonna get there
before it gets too, too cold.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:37.470
So if we can find some other
faster way than walking,

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.040
we'll take that.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.119
Why didn't we go before?

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.355
Because we didn't want to travel that far,

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.353
and because
we didn't wanna be away from...

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.630
all the places that we knew that were safe
and where we can get things.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:01.792
But we're done with this area now,
so we're gonna move on.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.159
Because of me.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.873
What?

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.679
Never mind.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.552
Stop. Stop.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.552
Come on. Stop.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.075
Okay. Hey, kiddo!

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.230
Kiddo.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.630
Come on.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.676
Can you give us a ride?

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.793
Ain't seen a boy that young in a while.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.350
You know, most people
say that to me, and I'm 19.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.671
Uh-huh. He was born
right when it happened.

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:05.960
Where are you from?

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.195
Farther south.

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.193
Yeah, we got some from all over.
103 of us.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.190
Oh, yeah?

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.640
You all live there?

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.720
Yeah.

01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:23.271
Kinda make our own way, you know,
food, power, and everything.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.400
I mean, we really have
everything you'd need...

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.280
including females.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.752
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.638
I seen 'em a lot when I was younger.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.518
I used to stock the bunker.

01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.910
That's the name of the place
where the females live.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.496
Yeah, I bring 'em supplies,
but I'd, you know,

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:44.080
I'd also sneak 'em little things
like coffee,

01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:46.516
and you know, cigarettes,
and chocolate, whatever.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.875
I mean, they were really nice.

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.159
Hold 'em pretty tight, huh?

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.993
Yeah, they do not leave the bunker.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.800
And, uh, you know, I'm not telling you
anything that I shouldn't be,

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.536
because everyone knows that they're there.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:00.200
They just can't get into the compound.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.755
Hey, stop the car.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.719
Stop the car for a second, man.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:08.561
There was someone back there
on the road, on the ground. Stop the car.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.470
Where is he?

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:31.519
I didn't see anything.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.716
What?

01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.354
I'm gonna take your car.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.120
What do you mean, man?

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:41.080
And you're gonna walk from here,
and you're gonna be fine, okay?

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:42.230
Why should I walk?

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.552
Because you aren't gonna fight me.
And you don't have a choice.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.960
And I don't have a choice.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.794
And I know you can't understand that,
but I'm taking the car.

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.111
What... why...

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.356
You'll be fine.

01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:55.999
I can't explain it.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.391
You helped those women out.
You helped 'em out.

01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.995
You snuck them things.
You look after them.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:09.434
You brought them...

01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:11.056
- Their coffee and their...
- That's different!

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.216
...cigarettes and all those treats.
You're a good person.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.594
I can't just give it to you, man.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.696
You helped 'em out.
You're gonna help us out. I can't explain.

01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720
Please!

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.475
- Stay there.
- Wait, come on, man! You...

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:44.669
We left him?

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.830
He's gonna be okay.

01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.112
Take all your wet clothes off.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.110
Where are we going?

01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.520
Same place.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:17.679
What's a bunker?

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.432
It's a kind of shelter.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.351
- Who is it?
- Hello, hello!

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.035
Hello, is Mark there?

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:54.191
No, there's no Mark.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.718
Can we come in? We're very cold.
I've got a little child here.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.156
- What do you want?
- I've got a child.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.196
May we come in and get warm
for one minute?

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.440
Thank you.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.434
I'm Tom.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.869
This is Calvin.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.713
- Hi.
- And this is Lemmy.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.835
Hi.

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.600
I'm Caleb, this is my son, Alex.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:47.680
And we're just heading home.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.431
This was my, uh,
grandparents' house.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.231
That's why I came here
a little bit when I was...

01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:03.039
young.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.431
It was abandoned when we found it.

01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:10.560
Would have fallen apart without us,
and it's been our home for four years.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.474
I understand.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:19.157
If there's someplace else
you need to go, we'll...

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.118
we'll help you out there.

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:24.470
Or you're welcome to stay the night.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.880
Okay, thanks.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.120
You got a weapon?

01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.830
No.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.274
Find that hard to believe.

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:34.400
It's all right.

01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.996
How's the little fellow feeling?

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.799
Okay.

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.998
Okay, well, I'm gonna get you set up.

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:44.673
You can stay.

01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.553
Do we have a safe spot?

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.040
Not yet.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.840
If we need to,
we're gonna go out the window,

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:12.038
and we're gonna go onto the ledge
and into the snow below.

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.794
And from there,
you go all the way to the tree line

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.951
right behind the fence, you understand?

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:19.673
Are we gonna leave in the morning?

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.479
Tell me what we do.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:23.153
We go out the window.

01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:26.438
- Now, are we gonna leave in the morning?
- Tell me what we're gonna do.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.910
- We're gonna go out the window...
- Shh!

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.833
And then what?

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:35.880
Then onto the ledge and then to the snow?

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:37.400
Yes.

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.515
And then what?

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:43.240
Then we find our way to the tree line.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.791
- Which tree line?
- The tree line that circles.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:50.679
The tree line behind the fence.

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.594
Backpack.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:05.875
Sleeping bag.

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:55.319
"And one lamb out of the flock,
out of 200,

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:58.871
out of the fat pastures of Israel.

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:00.952
And it shall be the prince's part

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:04.238
to give burnt offerings,
and meat offerings,

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:08.075
and drink offerings, in the feasts,

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:11.358
and in the new moons, and in the Sabbaths,

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:14.990
in all solemnities of the house of Israel,

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.834
he shall prepare the sin offering,

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.833
and the meat offering,
and the burnt offering,

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.594
and the peace offering,

01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.037
to make reconciliation
for the house of Israel.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:32.234
Thus sayeth the Lord God,
in the first month,

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:34.118
in the first day of the month..."

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:46.193
Okay, hey, Rag, Rag, Rag.

01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:47.316
What is it?

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:50.359
- Get dressed for outside.
- Are we leaving?

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.760
No, but we need to be quiet,
so we don't wake anyone.

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:53.950
Come on.

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.716
I'm gonna put your bag
under this pot.

01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:22.836
Okay.

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.640
Rag, where is your bag?

01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.760
Under the pot.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:30.076
Okay. How did we get here?

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.352
Past the animals,
along the fence line to the fallen tree.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.440
Okay.

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.875
Who is it okay to tell about this place?

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:42.235
I know.

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:44.312
It's like every other safe spot.

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.754
Answer me.

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.560
Okay, Dad, it's like every safe spot
that we have...

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.233
Rag, just answer me!

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.390
Nobody.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:55.996
Okay.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.233
Now, I want you to show me
how to get back.

01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.396
Hey.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.555
You were up early.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.677
We woke up, we didn't want to, uh,

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:20.195
wake anybody,
so we just took a walk around.

01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.754
How'd it look?

01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.911
- Looked nice.
- Yeah.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.593
Looks good.

01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.674
Would you like something to eat?
We have more than we know what to do with.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.877
Yes, please. That would be great.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.440
Thank you.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:43.638
Hey, we have some clothes in the attic
that might fit you.

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:45.680
Okay.

01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:49.160
Thank you.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.155
Thank you for this.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:08.390
You're welcome.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.113
It's very good.

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.876
You have a lot of people
come through, drop by, or...

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:19.431
Most of the men
in the area moved to the city.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.795
Some came back.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.638
We don't see anyone
unless we go into town.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.272
Is there a federal dispensary in town?

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.359
There's a market.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:34.511
And if you have papers, they'll honor 'em.

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.995
But we've got more than we need already,

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.914
and we rarely do any hunting anymore.

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.556
Hmm.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.394
You wanna stick around...

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:53.393
"And Jesus said,
'Come and have breakfast.'

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.752
And none of the disciples said,
'Who are you?'

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:00.560
Because they knew it was the Lord."

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:07.719
Amen.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.155
Ready?

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.594
Whoo-hoo!

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:49.712
That llama will keep the wolves
and coyotes away from the sheep.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:09.115
A few strokes and then you wanna dry it,

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.396
so it doesn't get gummed up.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.196
- What have you got there?
- Standard Winchester, 12 gauge.

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.736
I thought you weren't
doing any hunting up here.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.719
We don't want the sheep
being hunted either.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:24.951
Dad, it's to keep the wolves away.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.838
Rag, come here.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:30.560
I guess we put this away right now, huh?

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:33.439
I got anotherjob for you
if it's okay with your father.

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:38.440
But I wanna clean it.
He showed me how to be careful.

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:41.911
Doesn't matter. They're dangerous
to be around, no matter what.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.232
Is that your daughter?

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:05.475
That's my son.

01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:10.717
No, what I'm asking you is,
is that <i>your</i> daughter?

01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:17.194
Sir, that... that's my boy.

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.790
Well, I don't know
who you are or who she is

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:23.196
or how you came to be with her,

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:25.351
but I've sheltered you for the night.

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.830
And I don't wanna have
anything to do with evil.

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.800
World's seen enough of that.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.151
Okay, well,
our things are packed and we'll...

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.994
be on our way then.

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.912
It's not that simple.

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.309
If she's your God-given daughter,

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.517
and you are a faithful caretaker,

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:47.717
you better make me know it.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:52.192
If she isn't, I wanna know
how come you are in possession of her,

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.192
and I wanna believe it.

01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:58.439
Because I had a wife of 33 years.

01:27:58.520 --> 01:28:01.558
I had three girls and four granddaughters

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.836
and two step-granddaughters.

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:08.560
And all nine of 'em passed
in the course of a couple weeks.

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.877
One of 'em I lost to a pack of monsters.

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:17.876
So if you think that I'm gonna
be anything but an upstander,

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:21.158
you ought to know
that I don't have a damn thing to live for

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.799
but the grace of God.

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.400
That is my daughter.

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:04.394
I'm asking you to prove it to me, son.

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.677
That's her. That's me and her mother.

01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.797
Name is Anna Elizabeth Shaw.

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:38.670
We call her Rag, short for Raggedy Ann.

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:47.353
Well, I bet you've had one hell of a time.

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:52.395
Yeah.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:56.351
Had some good times too.

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.594
Would you like a drink?

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:29.478
Whiskey? Gin?

01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:31.950
No, thank you. I'm okay.

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.110
Have a seat.

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:56.875
I've been hearing about
some safe places for women.

01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.034
There's this one in New York,
and there's one not too far from here.

01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:04.715
Yeah.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.953
Uh, I've heard of places like that too.

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:11.874
Not so sure they're as safe
as people say, but...

01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:17.240
if that's your way of asking us to go,
I understand.

01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.475
No.

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:25.393
Seems to me
you've been at this a long time.

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:29.631
I wonder what the toll is.

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:35.991
How it shapes a growing person.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:45.678
We've had to let go of a lot.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:49.031
Rag has had the childhood
that she's had...

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.879
in order to survive.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:06.079
Maybe if you let go
a little bit more and let God...

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.314
What does that mean?

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:16.351
Sometimes running from one thing,
you just run into another.

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:23.195
If you stay put, you have faith,
and let God make the plan.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.751
The best thing I ever heard
about faith was...

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.993
"While you pray, move your feet."

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:48.510
Dad?

01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:33.478
How was that?

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.950
So hot.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:41.472
Do you remember Goldy from Art's ark?

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:44.439
Yes.

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:47.274
I think I know what happened to her.

01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:51.599
What happened to her?

01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:56.709
So when Art had the dream
that Goldy was saying "Help,"

01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.160
she wasn't actually saying "Help,"

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:00.038
she was saying, "Kelp,"

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:02.589
which is a food that grows in the water.

01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:05.792
It's... it's real.

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:08.600
And so, she was pointing at the kelp...

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.234
for the bird to go get.

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:16.031
And the bird got it for her
so she could feed everyone,

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:18.396
feed the llamas, so that they were full,

01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:20.790
and they could fight off the wolves.

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:27.116
And then she even fed Fang,
because Fang was now her friend.

01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:29.078
So he was nice now.

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:36.672
And so, basically, she fixed the boat,

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:40.959
and Art came, and everyone thought
that it was Art who saved the day.

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.838
Really, it was Goldy.

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:52.633
That is the most beautiful story
I have ever heard.

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.192
I got a story for you.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.112
- You wanna hear it?
- Sure.

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:04.870
This is a story about you.
Don't freak out.

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:07.154
Okay, fine.

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.749
So when you were in Mommy's belly...

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:15.993
we went to the doctor because that's
what you're supposed to do when...

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:20.199
When people are having babies,
you go check in with a doctor sometimes.

01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:25.071
And they had this special machine,
which you don't know about,

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:29.154
but they can take pictures
of a baby inside a mom

01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:30.435
through the belly.

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.874
Really?

01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:37.160
And sometimes,
if that baby's old enough in the belly,

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:39.197
they can tell if it's a boy or a girl.

01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:43.395
And we went to the doctor,
and he was just...

01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:46.632
looking around, taking his pictures.

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.959
And he said, "Do you wanna know
if it's a boy or a girl?"

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:56.551
And I kinda wanted to know,
but Mom did not want to know.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:57.994
She liked surprises.

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:02.920
And so I said yes and she said no.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.119
And so, first,
she had her way and we said no.

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:10.438
But the doctor said, "Well, I'm gonna
write it down on a piece of paper,

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.720
in case you change your mind."

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.917
And he wrote it down,
and he put it in an envelope,

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.639
and he gave it to us.

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.480
And we went home.

01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:23.840
And I was in bed,
and I was thinking about you,

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:27.794
and I did not know
if you were a boy or a girl.

01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:32.477
And I was thinking about all the stuff
that we'd have to do.

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:38.113
Like do we get boy toys or girl toys

01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:41.318
or little boy clothes
or little girl clothes.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.480
And I just thought,
"Why don't we just find out,

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:47.678
and then we can know, and then
we'll be prepared and ready for..."

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:52.160
But I knew that Mom would not wanna know.

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:54.470
But I couldn't take it.

01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:57.951
And so I snuck downstairs,
and I went and I found the envelope.

01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:04.440
I looked inside,
and there was a picture of you.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.557
And you were shaped like a little...

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:08.472
You were like a little bean.

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.199
That's how big you were.

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:15.314
And on the bottom, the doctor wrote...

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.032
"This is your daughter."

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:26.672
And then I went back upstairs.

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:31.996
And, um, then I went to sleep.

01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:34.953
I never told Mom.

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:48.360
I love you so much, Anna Elizabeth Shaw.

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.758
There are some men outside.

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.096
- Hey, get up.
- What, what? What is it?

01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:08.157
Listen. Shh. Quiet. It's a red alert.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:11.870
Now, get up. Listen to me.
Be ready to do something.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:15.736
Be very quiet, you understand?
You understand?

01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.035
Come on. Okay.

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.195
Shh!

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.936
Shh.

01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.360
Be quiet. Quiet.

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.794
Go back.

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.995
I asked you to leave.
I want you to get out of here...

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:51.680
- Is it...
- Shh.

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.160
Dad?

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:43.192
- Dad.
- Shh! Shh!

01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:50.680
Okay.

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:53.400
Listen to me. This is what we're gonna do.

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:54.630
Here's our plan.

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:57.554
We're gonna go out the window.
We have to get outside.

01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:00.712
So I'll lower you down onto the porch...

01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.553
below the roof.

01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.078
Okay? Okay?

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:11.154
And then we're gonna go to the safe spot
as quietly and quickly as we can, okay?

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:12.959
That's our plan, okay?

01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.599
Okay.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:19.514
They're up in the attic.

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:21.880
Okay, put on your jacket.

01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:32.589
Come on.

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:35.309
Put your arms around me.

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:45.636
Wait. Wait.

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.353
- Dad, let me go.
- Shh, quiet.

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:52.079
- Dad.
- Hold on.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.720
- I can do it.
- It's too high.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.076
Dad, let me go. No, it's too high.

01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.799
I'm gonna pull you back up.

01:41:58.880 --> 01:41:59.880
No.

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:00.960
Dad!

01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.635
Dad, let me go. Dad!

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.513
Let me go.

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:07.190
Okay.

01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:14.679
Rag? Rag?

01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:50.916
Ah!

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.514
Ah! Ah!

01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.272
Okay. Okay.

01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:46.800
Is that Tom?

01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:49.554
Don't look. Don't look.

01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:52.599
Don't look.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:53.830
Come on.

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:56.635
Come on.

01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:07.760
You have to put
your finger... finger in there, take...

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:41.830
Just... You just wait. Wait a... Wait.

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:44.316
Just wait for me.

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:50.680
I'm just gonna rest.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.800
- <i>I can't do it without you.
- You're gonna be fine.</i>

01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:21.997
- I can't, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:23.230
I won't.

01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:24.720
- Yes, you can.
- I can't.

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.519
You just gotta keep her close.

01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:29.074
And you're gonna figure it out.

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:32.073
I can't. I can't do it without you.

01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.673
You're gonna have each other.

01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:49.555
Rag!

01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.399
Rag!

01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:14.954
Rag!

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:24.189
Rag!

01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:50.072
We're gonna go somewhere
that's really safe and warm.

01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.954
Tom told me about a place
not too far from here

01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:55.554
where there's a bunch of really...

01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:59.431
friendly people, and...

01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:03.034
it's really...

01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:06.750
nice.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.480
It's okay, Dad.

01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:56.279
It's a love adventure.
