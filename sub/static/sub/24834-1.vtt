-[Neil] Yes?
-Hi.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.000
Sorry for calling so early.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.000
What do you want?

17:22.079 --> 17:23.960
I'm looking for Jenny, my daughter.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.599
I think she was with Chris last night.
Is she here?

17:26.680 --> 17:27.720
She didn't come home.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.880
No, sorry, she's not here.
Neither is Chris.

17:31.440 --> 17:32.720
Where is he?

17:32.800 --> 17:34.920
He told me he'd be at a friend's.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.400
Do you know which friend?

17:38.480 --> 17:41.160
Yeah, he said Ioan.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.840
"Going to Ioan's."

17:43.920 --> 17:45.520
Who the hell is Ioan?

17:46.560 --> 17:48.600
He was in a very bad mood.

17:48.680 --> 17:51.040
You can't talk to him when he's like that.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.840
Any idea where Ioan lives?

17:53.400 --> 17:55.960
No, sorry.

17:57.280 --> 18:00.400
Chris is 19. We try to make him feel
as free as possible.

18:01.000 --> 18:01.920
Right.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.560
There's a Ioan Fuller
who goes to our school.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.040
Year 12.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.000
He lives somewhere behind the park.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.000
Can you find out which house?

18:18.480 --> 18:21.800
I'll DM Shannon.
She's friends with his sister.

18:28.280 --> 18:29.320
[exhales]

18:57.360 --> 18:58.720
[Josh]  Hi, this is Josh Mason.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.920
Just leave your name and number
after the burp.  [burps]

19:02.000 --> 19:03.840
Where the hell are you?

19:03.920 --> 19:05.000
[ringing tone]

19:05.080 --> 19:06.480
[Tom] You sure this is it?

19:07.240 --> 19:09.080
According to my intel.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.080
-You got to stop watching  CSI.
-[Jenny]  Hi, this is Jenny.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.000
Leave a message after the beep.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.560
Okay.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.280
[doorbell ringing]

19:28.640 --> 19:29.800
Hello?

19:29.880 --> 19:32.280
Oh, excuse the outfit.
I'm doing boxer-cise.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.320
Sorry to bother you.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.040
My name's Tom.
Do you have a son called Ioan?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.360
Yes. Why?

19:38.440 --> 19:41.240
I'm trying to find a friend of his,
Chris Chahal,

19:41.320 --> 19:42.680
and my daughter Jenny.

19:42.760 --> 19:44.160
She hasn't come home.

19:45.280 --> 19:46.360
Ioan.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.680
Io-Io, door.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.480
This man wants to know
if you've seen his daughter, Jenny?

19:54.560 --> 19:56.400
[teenagers shouting]

19:56.480 --> 19:58.320
Or Chris Chahal.

19:58.400 --> 19:59.960
His mum said you might be friends.

20:00.840 --> 20:02.680
That he was staying the night.

20:02.760 --> 20:04.040
Staying the night?

20:04.120 --> 20:06.080
But he doesn't know any Chris. Do you?

20:06.720 --> 20:09.480
I know him.
He's sort of a friend of a friend.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.080
Through gaming tournaments.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.360
Any idea why he'd tell his mum
he was staying here?

20:16.840 --> 20:18.800
I think Jenny might be in trouble.

20:18.880 --> 20:21.520
I think Chris has got her
involved in something.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.320
So, if there's anything you know...

20:25.840 --> 20:27.040
Ioan.

20:27.840 --> 20:31.000
He asked me to lie for him... Chris.

20:32.400 --> 20:37.000
I don't know why. He said he needed to
tell his parents he was staying somewhere.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.720
He made me promise to lie.

20:39.800 --> 20:43.120
-Lie? Why you?
-I owed him some money.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.560
-Money?
-Not much. It was for a game.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.840
Look, he was never gonna stay, and...

20:48.680 --> 20:51.280
I don't know where he is, or Jenny.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.560
Okay.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.200
Can I leave my number?
In case you hear anything.

21:02.440 --> 21:03.440
Okay.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.640
[paper tearing]

21:10.920 --> 21:12.200
Thanks.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.320
You should talk to Sia.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.040
-Sia?
-Sia Marshall.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.800
Miss Popular.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.160
If anyone knows anything, then Sia will.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.280
-I'm not going.
-You are.

21:30.360 --> 21:32.200
I don't feel well.
Let us stay here.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.080
-No, in the car.
-Mum!

21:34.160 --> 21:36.120
You don't feel well
because you drank last night.

21:36.200 --> 21:37.040
Ellen, in the car.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.040
You know you shouldn't
because you're on medication

21:39.120 --> 21:41.640
-and I told you not to.
-I'm not going to Grandma's.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.320
Henry, I'm already late.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.080
Ow! Get off!

21:46.160 --> 21:49.160
I'm arresting you for refusing to do
what your mother says.

21:49.240 --> 21:51.000
You do not have to say anything,

21:51.080 --> 21:53.320
-but anything you do say will...
-Get off me.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.440
Everything all right?

21:57.440 --> 21:58.320
[sighs]

21:59.000 --> 22:00.240
Where were you?

22:01.840 --> 22:03.680
Here, there...

22:03.760 --> 22:05.960
-Where?
-Out.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.240
Out of the gates into the big, wide world.

22:10.520 --> 22:11.800
I thought moving out meant

22:11.880 --> 22:13.760
I didn't have to answer
these questions anymore?

22:13.840 --> 22:16.160
Only when it affects our children.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.160
Great day they'll have,

22:18.240 --> 22:20.240
watching their father
sleeping off a hangover.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.320
I was having fun, Soph.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.120
-Remember fun?
-Yes.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.120
And now I have to work. Remember work?

22:27.840 --> 22:28.920
Yeah.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.720
Be a father, Josh.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.880
Can you do that?

22:35.120 --> 22:37.240
And get a shower. You stink.

22:37.320 --> 22:38.360
[door closes]

22:51.840 --> 22:53.480
[doorbell ringing]

22:55.200 --> 22:56.840
-[Jojo] Come in. Come in.
-Thanks.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.520
[Jojo] So, what can I get you?

22:59.600 --> 23:02.000
Tea, coffee, cheeky brandy?

23:02.080 --> 23:03.240
-[chuckles] I'm fine.
-Not a problem.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.920
Sia!

23:05.880 --> 23:07.720
Here she is, the chief exec.

23:07.800 --> 23:11.160
Lauren, this is Tom.
Dad of Jenny, one of Sia's friends.

23:11.240 --> 23:13.360
We met at that school fundraiser.

23:13.440 --> 23:16.840
Hmm. Don't think so.
I wouldn't forget such a handsome man.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.400
[Jojo chuckles] We've been away.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.440
Wedding anniversary,
back to where we got married.

23:20.520 --> 23:21.560
Reliving it, weren't you?

23:21.640 --> 23:23.720
We took the albums with us,
all the old photos.

23:23.800 --> 23:24.960
She couldn't stop crying on the day.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.360
With happiness, I hope.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.800
Mind you, everyone was at it.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.720
Even the cake was in tiers. Ba-dum!

23:29.800 --> 23:31.240
Did you want me?

23:31.320 --> 23:34.440
No, I bellowed your name up the stairs
for the good of my health.

23:34.520 --> 23:35.880
Tom Delaney, Jenny's dad.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.120
Wondering if you'd seen her?

23:37.200 --> 23:38.760
Jenny? No, is everything okay?

23:38.840 --> 23:40.600
Well, she hasn't come home.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.920
We also can't find her boyfriend.
Older kid...

23:44.000 --> 23:45.280
Chris Chahal.

23:46.280 --> 23:47.480
Talk to the man.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.640
Where'd you go last night?
Did you see 'em?

23:49.720 --> 23:51.880
Um... into town, but I didn't see them.

23:51.960 --> 23:54.520
Yeah, like I say, we were away.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.720
Have you tried their mobiles?

23:55.800 --> 23:57.040
-[cell phone ringing]
-'Course you have.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.960
Sorry, work.

24:01.760 --> 24:02.640
Hi.

24:31.320 --> 24:33.440
Anything happening?
Get your feet off the desk.

24:33.520 --> 24:37.240
-Seems very quiet in here this morning.
-Well, it is Sunday.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.280
There's this.

24:39.760 --> 24:43.000
The headmaster of a local school
has called with an allegation.

24:43.080 --> 24:44.480
He said it's important.

24:44.560 --> 24:45.840
Important?

24:46.320 --> 24:48.320
-Someone's stolen the blackboard.
-Ha.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.520
Do they still have blackboards?

24:50.600 --> 24:51.600
No.

24:53.040 --> 24:55.760
-When does the new girl start?
-This morning. God help me.

24:55.840 --> 24:58.320
She's young and pretty.
I hate her already.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.520
-Hey...
-Hi. Emma Castle.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.160
Sophie Mason. Welcome.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.360
[Emma]  My first big case.
The local school.

25:10.440 --> 25:13.760
If you're such a big city girl,
why move to a small town?

25:13.840 --> 25:15.520
No reason. Just fancied a change.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.320
Oh, I'm a detective.
You'll have to lie better than that.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.200
Bad break-up. A guy I worked with.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.440
What's this?

25:25.400 --> 25:26.560
[Sophie] It's what it says.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.280
School fire, years back.

25:29.320 --> 25:30.640
Some children died.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.160
This is rather delicate,

25:46.240 --> 25:49.400
which is why I thought it might be best
away from wagging tongues.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.720
-[Sophie] You said there was a note?
-Anonymous, typed.

25:51.800 --> 25:55.200
Accusations of sexual relations
between a teacher and a student.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.520
In different circumstances,

25:56.600 --> 26:00.800
I might have dismissed this as a crank
or a pupil wanting revenge.

26:01.360 --> 26:05.400
But there has been gossip
about this particular teacher before.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.040
I felt I had a responsibility
to report it.

26:08.120 --> 26:09.200
Zoe Chahal?

26:09.280 --> 26:11.040
-Teaches French. Do you know her?
-Mmm.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.320
I've asked her to come in.

26:12.400 --> 26:14.160
The note refers to evidence,

26:14.240 --> 26:16.280
something she keeps in her staff locker.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.440
But I didn't want to search it
without you present,

26:18.520 --> 26:20.480
-in case I found something incriminating.
-[cell phone ringing]

26:20.560 --> 26:22.520
-You did the right thing.
-Absolutely.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.160
When will she be here?

26:29.240 --> 26:31.240
[heart rate monitor beeping]

26:53.240 --> 26:55.040
[Tom] Hey, Pete!

26:55.120 --> 26:57.840
I've gotta go. Call me.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.880
[ringing tone]

27:17.880 --> 27:19.840
[operator]  Emergency.
Which service do you require?

27:19.920 --> 27:20.760
Police.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.160
Zoe, thanks for coming in.

27:25.720 --> 27:27.080
Am I in trouble?

27:30.240 --> 27:31.640
This is crazy.

27:31.720 --> 27:36.240
I can assure you. All you'll find
are a few books and my gym kit,

27:36.320 --> 27:38.440
which I forgot to take home.

27:38.520 --> 27:41.840
[Sophie] I'm sorry we have to do this,
but with allegations of this sort...

27:41.920 --> 27:45.640
Of course. I take it seriously,
but I'm telling you...

27:45.720 --> 27:48.320
Whoever is behind this is crazy.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.040
[keys clatter]

27:58.040 --> 27:58.960
Can I?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.280
Sure.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.160
What's on this?

28:44.560 --> 28:46.680
I have no idea what that is.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.360
Someone must have put it in my locker.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.640
You're absolutely sure
this isn't your property?

28:51.720 --> 28:53.440
Absolutely sure.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.120
Is there somewhere we can open this?

29:20.240 --> 29:23.400
These appear to be intimate letters,
written to you.

29:24.960 --> 29:25.960
Are they from a student?

29:26.520 --> 29:28.400
This is ridiculous. Tim?

29:28.480 --> 29:30.640
We should continue this
down at the station.

29:38.840 --> 29:40.040
[officer 1]  You didn't argue?

29:40.600 --> 29:41.640
No.

29:41.720 --> 29:43.960
[officer 1] And she's never done
anything like this before?

29:44.040 --> 29:45.040
Never.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.040
I've called and called, sent texts.

29:47.120 --> 29:48.400
She wouldn't let me worry.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.320
-She's not that kind of kid.
-I understand.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.400
And she's 16. That's worrying.

29:53.480 --> 29:55.600
-But you said the boyfriend's older?
-Nineteen.

29:55.680 --> 29:57.880
And he's also un-contactable,

29:57.960 --> 29:59.800
which suggests they might be together.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.680
[officer 2] Does he live here?
In the gated community?

30:01.760 --> 30:04.520
Yes, with his parents,
but he hasn't been home.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.080
We see a lot of this with teenagers.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.320
-But statistically--
-Statistically?

30:10.720 --> 30:13.840
Statistically, my wife had
a 60% survival rate.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.040
It doesn't stop me visiting her grave.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.600
[crying] Dad, come home.

30:38.080 --> 30:39.720
Please come home.

30:56.880 --> 31:00.760
Ioan? Can you talk? Ioan!

31:06.480 --> 31:08.480
Ioan, I just wanna talk.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.440
Stop! Ioan!

31:12.400 --> 31:13.680
Fuck.

31:30.960 --> 31:32.040
Wait!

31:35.280 --> 31:36.800
I just wanna talk!

31:38.320 --> 31:39.360
-Ioan!
-[car horn honking]

31:39.440 --> 31:41.760
[man] Watch what you're doin',
you stupid idiot!

31:45.320 --> 31:46.880
[panting]

31:47.880 --> 31:50.000
Why did you run?

31:56.560 --> 31:57.960
Why run, Ioan?

31:58.960 --> 32:00.520
Did you talk to Sia?

32:00.600 --> 32:01.440
Yes. Why run?

32:01.520 --> 32:02.640
What did she say?

32:02.720 --> 32:03.880
That she went to town.

32:03.960 --> 32:06.000
Didn't see either Jenny or Chris.

32:07.640 --> 32:09.360
My daughter's missing.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.480
No more fucking lies.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.160
I saw her last night.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.360
-Where?
-There was a party.

32:20.920 --> 32:21.960
Loads of kids there.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.480
It was pretty wild.

32:23.560 --> 32:24.560
[Tom]  Was she with Chris?

32:24.640 --> 32:26.080
[Ioan]  He was off his head.

32:26.720 --> 32:29.280
She seemed pissed off with him.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.320
What's going...

32:30.400 --> 32:32.520
[Ioan]  Look, this thing wasn't tame.

32:33.280 --> 32:34.800
Everyone was getting pretty wasted.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.960
Drugs?

32:37.920 --> 32:39.520
Was Jenny on drugs?

32:41.800 --> 32:43.000
I'm not sure.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.440
She seemed kind of high, but...

32:45.040 --> 32:46.520
Who knows? It could have just been drink.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.160
When did you last see Jenny?

32:48.240 --> 32:49.720
What time did she leave the party?

32:51.360 --> 32:52.880
I'm not sure.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.920
But it ended pretty abrupt, around 11:00.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.680
And whose house was it?

32:56.760 --> 32:57.920
The party's over. Please go!

32:58.000 --> 32:59.040
[Ioan]  The girl I told you to talk to.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.360
Make your way out! Go!

33:01.400 --> 33:02.280
Sia?

33:04.440 --> 33:06.200
Sia had a house party?

33:08.240 --> 33:09.240
[scoffs]

33:30.280 --> 33:31.240
[Emma]  She's lying.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.200
Says who?

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
You barely even spoke back there.

33:37.600 --> 33:40.160
Little smiles to her. What is that?

33:40.240 --> 33:41.640
Small town thing?

33:41.720 --> 33:44.160
-Your kids go to the same parties?
-Oi!

33:45.160 --> 33:46.960
[Emma] Sophie, look at the evidence.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.560
If this was a guy,
we'd be screaming pedophile.

33:49.640 --> 33:50.680
The evidence.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.800
An anonymous tip-off to the head.

33:52.880 --> 33:55.640
Love letters with kisses and no names.
And the stuff in there?

33:56.200 --> 33:57.120
"Did I get an A-plus?

33:57.200 --> 33:59.480
-Didn't know that was in the curriculum."
-Kids are idiots.

33:59.560 --> 34:01.400
See the look on her face
when we found them?

34:01.480 --> 34:02.400
Surprise.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.760
Genuine surprise. It doesn't add up, Emma.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.719
So, no, it's not a small town thing.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.320
It's a good cop thing.

34:17.360 --> 34:19.199
-[voicemail beeps]
-[Tom]  Sophie, it's Tom.

34:19.280 --> 34:20.600
I've got a problem.

34:22.639 --> 34:24.199
Oh, Darren, feet!

34:25.920 --> 34:29.120
Jenny Delaney, the missing 16-year-old
that was reported this morning.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.600
There is a boyfriend: Chris Chahal.

34:31.679 --> 34:33.639
Neither one has been seen
since last night.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.719
Any information,
I wanna see it straight away.

34:35.800 --> 34:37.199
Chris Chahal?

34:37.679 --> 34:39.080
-Is that any relation--
-Yes.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.199
It's his mother.

34:53.360 --> 34:56.600
-Yes?
-Your daughter lied to my face.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.320
She had a party.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.280
[Jojo] I gave you specific...

35:01.040 --> 35:04.480
I'm appalled. No, no, worse,
I'm disappointed.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.600
The fact that you lied to me and to Tom...

35:06.680 --> 35:09.000
I can't apologize enough. I really can't.

35:09.640 --> 35:11.080
I'm sorry that I lied.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.160
I just need facts.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.600
If Jenny was here, when did she leave?

35:15.680 --> 35:16.880
Jenny was here.

35:17.760 --> 35:21.000
But I only remember seeing her early on,
like 8:00-ish.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.440
Maybe 9:00?

35:23.720 --> 35:25.120
And after that, I don't know.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.600
Was she with Chris?

35:27.440 --> 35:30.000
I genuinely don't know.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.240
Who's Chris?

35:31.720 --> 35:33.680
He's, like, 20. He's dropped out of uni.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.400
I don't know him that well.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.560
Why did you suddenly stop the party?

35:39.120 --> 35:41.440
The kid I spoke to
says you threw everyone out.

35:42.480 --> 35:45.840
Well, the place was getting trashed.
I panicked.

35:45.920 --> 35:49.080
There was so many more people
than I'd invited.

35:49.160 --> 35:50.960
I wanted to get rid of them.

35:52.040 --> 35:53.600
-I'm calling the police.
-Police?

35:53.680 --> 35:55.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you insinuating?

35:55.720 --> 35:57.440
This is the last place Jenny was seen.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.320
There were, what? 30, 40 kids here?

35:59.400 --> 36:02.160
Someone must know something.
Someone must have seen her.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.040
[camera shutter clicking]

36:39.040 --> 36:41.800
Tickle... [growling]

36:41.880 --> 36:42.760
[children laughing]

36:43.960 --> 36:46.480
[Josh] I smell tickle!

36:46.560 --> 36:47.680
[Ellen] Daddy's got me!

36:47.760 --> 36:50.800
[Josh] Yes, he's got...
Oh, my God! My beer!

36:51.360 --> 36:53.480
Watch the beer! Please save the beer!

36:53.560 --> 36:55.080
Oh, my God!

36:55.160 --> 36:58.760
Okay, okay, you win.
Oh, good Lord! Why are you so strong?

36:58.840 --> 37:00.840
-[children laughing]
-[Josh exclaiming]

38:21.160 --> 38:23.160
[crying]

38:57.920 --> 38:59.920
[panting]

39:02.320 --> 39:04.160
Where the fuck have you been?

39:05.520 --> 39:06.600
Sorry.

39:07.400 --> 39:08.520
Yeah, right.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.520
[cell phone ringing]

39:16.520 --> 39:19.960
-Hello?
-[Ioan]  Mr. Delaney, it's Ioan.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.960
I've found something you need to see.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.960
The Facebook timeline of a girl, Dora.
She was at the party.

39:37.520 --> 39:38.960
Hey, man, you know what?

39:39.040 --> 39:41.520
-You missed such a great party.
-Okay, and?

39:42.680 --> 39:43.960
This one.

39:44.040 --> 39:44.960
[boy]  Freddie...

39:45.040 --> 39:47.120
-[Ioan] Look there.
-[Tom] What should I be seeing?

39:47.200 --> 39:48.400
Freddie...

39:48.480 --> 39:50.520
-I told you to come to this party...
-There.

39:52.000 --> 39:52.880
Jenny.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.600
[Ioan] She's getting into that car.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.080
[Tom] Can I...

39:58.480 --> 40:01.400
Who is he? Do you know him?

40:03.920 --> 40:04.920
[Tom] It's Pete.
