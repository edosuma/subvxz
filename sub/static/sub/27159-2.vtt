00:05.433 --> 00:08.767
People have never seen
so big bum, so they're like,

00:09.000 --> 00:10.467
"What is this?"
[laughing]

00:10.500 --> 00:12.100
I want my nipples down.

00:12.133 --> 00:14.100
You want your nipples lower?

00:14.133 --> 00:15.233
Yeah. And to the side.

00:15.266 --> 00:17.100
And to the side?
Yeah.

00:17.133 --> 00:18.300
Okay.

00:18.333 --> 00:21.033
My last doctor
put a hole in my nose.

00:21.066 --> 00:23.100
Can you get a hole
through your skin again? Yes.

00:23.133 --> 00:25.166
The whole tip
can turn black and die.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.367
My mind is spinning,

00:26.400 --> 00:29.233
like, should I do it
or should I not do it?

00:29.266 --> 00:31.066
The nurses pull me
to the back,

00:31.100 --> 00:34.100
and they say, "We can try
to drop the price down

00:34.133 --> 00:36.567
if you puncture
the implant."

00:36.600 --> 00:39.133
I got the syringe.
I would stab it,

00:39.166 --> 00:41.200
and then I would
suck it out--

00:41.233 --> 00:43.300
[gasps]
...and suck it out
and suck it out.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.266
Ucch. So different.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.567
What's worse than bad?

00:46.600 --> 00:48.567
Very bad.

I'm Natasha Crowe,

01:03.166 --> 01:05.533
and I think bigger is better.

01:05.567 --> 01:08.467
I've been slim,
and now I'm big,

01:08.500 --> 01:12.300
and I will never, ever,
ever be slim again.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.600
The bigger, the better.

01:14.600 --> 01:16.233
My bum is like

01:16.266 --> 01:17.500
another dimension.

01:17.533 --> 01:19.400
I have broken chairs
with my bum.

01:19.433 --> 01:21.500
I have broken beds.

01:21.533 --> 01:23.533
I have broken people
with my bum.

01:25.567 --> 01:27.467
I was born in Serbia,

01:27.500 --> 01:30.600
and I moved to Sweden
when I was 10 years old.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.333
I have always been different.

01:32.367 --> 01:34.333
And in Sweden, women think

01:34.367 --> 01:36.333
that the skinnier,
more beautiful,

01:36.367 --> 01:38.066
but I think they need to see

01:38.100 --> 01:42.600
this is how real woman
should look.

01:44.166 --> 01:46.100
I started to go to the gym.

01:46.133 --> 01:47.367
The bum grew.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.567
At some point,
it just stopped,

01:49.600 --> 01:51.667
so I decided
to have surgeries.

01:51.700 --> 01:53.400
That's the start
of everything.

01:53.433 --> 01:55.433
The doctor I pick,

01:55.467 --> 01:58.066
he knew what I want
to achieve.

01:58.100 --> 02:01.467
He told me that he could
take my fat from my back,

02:01.500 --> 02:04.300
from my arms, inner thighs,

02:04.333 --> 02:06.367
and put it in my bum.

02:06.400 --> 02:10.066
After my first surgery,
I was so happy.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.667
Six months later, I told him,
"You did a great job,

02:12.700 --> 02:15.266
but I want to have more."

02:15.300 --> 02:17.600
And he was like, "Okay."
[laughing]

02:17.633 --> 02:19.533
We planned
the second surgery.

02:19.567 --> 02:21.500
I knew the more fat I have,

02:21.533 --> 02:23.200
the bigger bum's gonna be,

02:23.233 --> 02:25.433
so I decided
to gain a lot of weight.

02:25.467 --> 02:27.400
I love to eat.

02:27.433 --> 02:29.600
I've gained 20 kilos,

02:29.633 --> 02:31.667
and then I did second surgery.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.633
Over the last four years,
I have had

02:33.667 --> 02:35.600
three Brazilian butt lifts,

02:35.633 --> 02:37.367
one breast augmentation,

02:37.400 --> 02:39.266
and then I've done
some fillers

02:39.300 --> 02:42.533
in my chin, my lips,
and my cheekbones.

02:42.567 --> 02:45.233
That not surgery
just complete your look.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.734
People came to me and told,
"Are you a plus size model?"

02:48.767 --> 02:51.567
So I was like,
"Okay. Do that."

02:51.600 --> 02:55.166
Right now I work out
three to four times a week.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.667
Everyone want to be
size zero,

02:56.700 --> 02:59.367
and I'm size 50.
[laughing]

02:59.400 --> 03:01.166
I'm having a consultation

03:01.200 --> 03:03.200
with Dr. Dubrow
and Dr. Nassif

03:03.233 --> 03:05.500
to see if they can
fix my breasts

03:05.533 --> 03:07.367
because they're
really saggy now,

03:07.400 --> 03:08.734
so I want to lift them up

03:08.767 --> 03:10.700
and do them bigger.

03:10.734 --> 03:15.233
My goal is to have
the world's biggest bum,

03:15.266 --> 03:18.166
and nothing is gonna stop me
from achieving my goal.

03:20.266 --> 03:22.500
Ooh, they're hot.
[chuckling]

03:22.533 --> 03:24.667
Oh, my God,
it's so beautiful
out here today.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.133
Look at the waves.

03:26.166 --> 03:27.400
My name is Hope,

03:27.433 --> 03:29.500
but there is no hope

03:29.533 --> 03:31.367
for these breasts
right here.

03:31.400 --> 03:34.166
My right breast
is extremely high.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.500
It ripples, and I have
no areola on the bottom.

03:37.533 --> 03:40.333
My left breast
is extremely hard,

03:40.367 --> 03:43.367
and all around the bottom,
it's massive scarring.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.233
I need this side to be
higher, Mariah, please,

03:46.266 --> 03:48.600
so it kind of will
match this side.
Yeah.

03:48.633 --> 03:51.367
If my mom was able
to have her breasts fixed,

03:51.400 --> 03:53.333
I think that it would
make things

03:53.367 --> 03:55.400
a lot easier
in our lives.

03:55.433 --> 03:57.667
How am I supposed to feel
good about my girls

03:57.700 --> 03:59.533
if she can't feel good
about her girls?

03:59.567 --> 04:01.667
All right. That's better.
So tight.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.433
I met my husband
when I was 18.

04:04.467 --> 04:07.567
After having my children
and breast-feeding,

04:07.600 --> 04:10.433
the little bit of breasts
that I had, they were gone.

04:10.467 --> 04:14.000
I was 24 when I had
my first surgery in Houston.

04:14.033 --> 04:15.767
I met my doctor
through a referral

04:16.000 --> 04:17.300
from one of my friends,

04:17.333 --> 04:18.433
and she had her breasts done,

04:18.467 --> 04:19.567
and they looked amazing.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.300
About six months
after surgery,

04:22.333 --> 04:24.266
my right breast
was getting hard.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.533
I went through
three more surgeries
with that same doctor.

04:27.567 --> 04:29.300
Then I realized
I probably might need

04:29.333 --> 04:31.000
to try to go see
another doctor.

04:31.033 --> 04:34.467
I had a, um, colleague
recommend this new doctor.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.433
I wake up from surgery.

04:36.467 --> 04:38.567
My breasts were
in the worst shape

04:38.600 --> 04:40.467
that they had ever been.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.700
I now have to have
a revision.

04:42.734 --> 04:46.300
So I have my surgery
five days later,

04:46.333 --> 04:49.000
and I'm just having
a lot of swelling.

04:49.033 --> 04:52.633
And where I'm massaging it
where the incision was,

04:52.667 --> 04:54.333
it busts open.

04:54.367 --> 04:56.734
I swear, it was like
a gallon worth of fluid

04:56.767 --> 04:58.700
just gushing
out of my breast.

04:58.734 --> 05:01.500
I thought, I'm gonna die
right here in this room.

05:03.066 --> 05:05.533
I called my doctor
immediately.

05:05.567 --> 05:08.033
My implant is taken out.

05:08.066 --> 05:10.734
My life was at
a complete standstill

05:10.767 --> 05:13.700
for the whole time
I went without a breast.

05:13.734 --> 05:17.633
I was having to stuff my bra
with this fake implant,

05:17.667 --> 05:18.734
and now at this point,

05:18.767 --> 05:20.767
my kids think that it's funny

05:21.000 --> 05:22.600
that I have one boob,

05:22.633 --> 05:26.266
so every time
they would act up,

05:26.300 --> 05:28.233
especially in the car,

05:28.266 --> 05:31.033
I would just pull
this fake implant out,

05:31.066 --> 05:34.433
and I would smack them
right in the face with it.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.333
A year and a half after I've
gone without this implant,

05:39.367 --> 05:41.767
I come across another
doctor in Houston.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.533
I wake up from surgery.

05:43.567 --> 05:47.400
Nothing even matches
or is right at all.

05:47.433 --> 05:48.467
I'm just thinking

05:48.500 --> 05:50.333
there's never ever gonna be

05:50.367 --> 05:53.000
an end to this crazy, crazy

05:53.033 --> 05:55.567
mess disaster
that I'm living with.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.633
I'm just so ready
to meet

05:57.667 --> 05:59.767
with Dr. Dubrow
and Dr. Nassif.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.567
I know. I'm hoping
it can be fixed, too.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.467
It would be a real burden
off of our shoulders.

06:03.500 --> 06:06.367
I'm now divorced,
totally not dating,

06:06.400 --> 06:08.033
because of my breasts.

06:08.066 --> 06:09.667
I really don't want
to think about it,

06:09.700 --> 06:10.767
but if I do,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
my negative self-image
is probably

06:14.033 --> 06:15.533
carried over to Mariah.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.633
My daughter is 21 years old,

06:17.667 --> 06:19.633
and she's never
had a boyfriend.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.633
That really breaks my heart.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.400
You're feeling good about it?

06:23.433 --> 06:26.667
From what I've seen,
they're like surgical gods.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.367
Well, that's what we need.
We need a miracle.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.266
I'm thinking we'd
totally need a miracle.

06:30.300 --> 06:34.533
All I want is for my boobs
to be symmetric

06:34.567 --> 06:36.533
and my areolas to match.

06:36.567 --> 06:37.667
That's all that I want.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.567
I'm just
really tired of it.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.433
I know. It's been
a lot for both of us.

06:42.467 --> 06:45.066
If Dr. Dubrow
and Dr. Nassif

06:45.100 --> 06:46.633
cannot help me,

06:46.667 --> 06:49.000
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

06:49.033 --> 06:52.100
I'm seriously gonna just
go hide under a rock.

06:53.734 --> 06:54.767

07:33.400 --> 07:34.500
Ooh.

07:34.533 --> 07:36.000
An exposed implant.

07:36.033 --> 07:37.467
One of the worst
complications
she can have.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.133
Did she lose
half of her areola?

07:39.166 --> 07:41.433
Is that gone?
Well, she had
that exposed implant.

07:41.467 --> 07:43.100
Yeah, and that's right
in the middle of her areola.
So that destroyed-- Right.

07:43.133 --> 07:44.533
So let's call her in.
Let's bring in Hope.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.700
Okay. Can you please
send in Hope?

07:48.433 --> 07:49.700

I'm good. How are you?
I'm Dr. Nassif.

07:51.467 --> 07:53.467
I've never known my mother
without messed-up breasts,

07:53.500 --> 07:54.734
you know, and that's hard.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.367
I'm 21. Like,

07:56.400 --> 07:58.100
I'm just ready
for them to be fixed.

07:58.133 --> 07:59.734
Take us back
to the beginning.

07:59.767 --> 08:01.133
20 years ago,

08:01.166 --> 08:04.100
I started with 420 CCs.

08:04.133 --> 08:06.333
About six,
seven months after that,

08:06.367 --> 08:08.367
I-- I noticed
it was getting hard.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.166
I went back and had four
different surgeries.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.567
It continued to get hard.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.667
Okay, then what happened?

08:13.700 --> 08:15.600
So I had
a flight attendant friend

08:15.633 --> 08:18.200
who tells me about
this great doctor in L.A.,

08:18.233 --> 08:20.700
and he tells me he can
take care of everything.

08:20.734 --> 08:23.100
It was gonna cost me
a lot of money.

08:23.133 --> 08:25.066
But the nurses
pull me to the back,

08:25.100 --> 08:28.667
and they say, "You know, we can
try to drop the price down

08:28.700 --> 08:31.567
if you puncture the implant"--

08:31.600 --> 08:32.633
What?

08:32.667 --> 08:34.400
"And tear a hole in it."

08:34.433 --> 08:36.500
I got the syringe.
I would stab it,

08:36.533 --> 08:38.767
and then I would suck it out

08:39.000 --> 08:40.667
and suck it out
and suck it out.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.633
I've never heard of anything
like this before.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.200
I was standing
in the bathroom with her.

08:44.233 --> 08:45.500
I watched it all happen.

08:45.533 --> 08:46.633
[gasps]

08:46.667 --> 08:48.467
I was probably like 10 or 11.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.767
You know what we call this
in plastic surgery?

08:51.000 --> 08:52.600
This area of the anatomy?

08:52.633 --> 08:54.200
We call this tiger country

08:54.233 --> 08:56.600
because there's
big arteries and veins,

08:56.633 --> 08:58.166
and if you hit them,

08:58.200 --> 09:02.600
you can instantly
bleed to death.

09:02.633 --> 09:04.667
It sickens me to know

09:04.700 --> 09:08.433
that I could possibly
have taken my own life

09:08.467 --> 09:10.100
for something so vain.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.133
What did you do next?

09:11.166 --> 09:12.533
I go and have surgery.

09:12.567 --> 09:14.533
About two weeks
after the surgery,

09:14.567 --> 09:16.667
it started swelling badly.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.600
Oh, my gosh.
I started touching on it,

09:18.633 --> 09:20.734
and it busts
where the incision's at.

09:20.767 --> 09:22.166
Yeah.

09:22.200 --> 09:23.400
So I call him,

09:23.433 --> 09:24.700
and he takes me back there,

09:24.734 --> 09:26.066
and he removes it--
Right.

09:26.100 --> 09:27.467
...so then I go almost
a year and a half

09:27.500 --> 09:28.533
without an implant.

09:28.567 --> 09:29.734
An exposed implant

09:29.767 --> 09:31.433
is basically a disaster

09:31.467 --> 09:33.533
because it means
that the foreign body,

09:33.567 --> 09:35.667
the implant material,
is now contaminated

09:35.700 --> 09:38.000
by the outside air
with bacteria,

09:38.033 --> 09:39.533
so it immediately
has to come out,

09:39.567 --> 09:41.066
or an infection
will result.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.567
Okay, so now, a year
and a half after--

09:43.600 --> 09:46.567
I find a doctor in Texas
not far from me.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.166
A new doctor.
A new doctor,

09:48.200 --> 09:51.633
and he puts in a very,
very aggressive implant.

09:51.667 --> 09:53.533
In a week,
the bandages come off.

09:53.567 --> 09:56.066
I'm like, "This is--
This is definitely not right."

09:56.100 --> 09:57.266
Right away.
Is this
your last surgery?

09:57.300 --> 09:58.433
Yes.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.033
What are your goals?

10:00.066 --> 10:03.033
I just want them to be even,

10:03.066 --> 10:05.166
and I would like
my areolas to match.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.734
Hope's case is challenging.

10:06.767 --> 10:08.600
She's had multiple surgeries,

10:08.633 --> 10:10.767
multiple complications.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.567
I just hope
that Terry can help her.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.033
This is an extremely
difficult case.

10:16.066 --> 10:17.700
And the only way
we're gonna know what to do

10:17.734 --> 10:21.667
is to assess how bad
the damage really is
to your breasts.

10:21.700 --> 10:23.066
Okay.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.767
The chances
this will work is low.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.266
And the chances you could
have a complication is high.

10:29.700 --> 10:31.066
I don't need a man.

10:31.100 --> 10:32.567

a scarification problem,

10:48.567 --> 10:51.633
which basically means
scar tissue

10:51.667 --> 10:55.667

11:05.700 --> 11:07.667
who's had multiple
complications from

11:07.700 --> 11:10.166
many previous
plastic surgery revisions,

11:10.200 --> 11:13.700
we try to think
of a new, unique solution

11:13.734 --> 11:16.066
so that we don't follow
down the same path

11:16.100 --> 11:17.300
and have the same

11:17.333 --> 11:19.266
complications that they
suffered previously.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.300
I think
the thing to do is

11:21.333 --> 11:22.567
elevate up the muscle,

11:22.600 --> 11:24.734
try to manipulate
the scar tissue,

11:24.767 --> 11:26.333
put smaller implants in,

11:26.367 --> 11:29.133
and then, you know, hope

11:29.166 --> 11:31.667
because the chances
this will work is low,

11:31.700 --> 11:34.633

have a complication is high.

is when I started noticing

13:05.033 --> 13:08.166
that my nose was bigger
than most of my friends'.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.033
They were calling me
Pinocchio.

13:10.066 --> 13:11.433
When I was 30 years old

13:11.467 --> 13:13.166
is when I definitely decided

13:13.200 --> 13:15.200
I was having plastic surgery.

13:15.233 --> 13:18.066
I had two friends that
actually went to the surgeon.

13:18.100 --> 13:20.400
Both of my friends
he did great work for.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.734
I did decide to go in
and have my breasts done

13:23.767 --> 13:26.100
and my nose done
by this doctor.

13:26.133 --> 13:28.233
After my surgery, I woke up,

13:28.266 --> 13:30.333
and my breasts were there,
and it was great.

13:30.367 --> 13:32.734
But my nose, it didn't
look a whole lot different.

13:32.767 --> 13:34.200
It was still long.

13:34.233 --> 13:36.734
After a year
is when he suggested

13:36.767 --> 13:39.033
he go in and do a revision.

13:39.066 --> 13:40.300
So we went ahead and did it,

13:40.333 --> 13:41.767
and, at the one-day check-in,

13:42.000 --> 13:43.400
he mentioned that things

13:43.433 --> 13:45.000
didn't go that smoothly,

13:45.033 --> 13:47.367
that he actually
put a hole in my nose.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.734
My heart just sank.

13:48.767 --> 13:51.033
He removed the bandages,

13:51.066 --> 13:52.767
and that's when I saw

13:53.000 --> 13:56.300
that my whole nose had
a big black scab over it.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.166
It was like "You got
to be kidding me.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.033
This is what I look like?"

14:00.066 --> 14:02.000
The tip of my nose was dead.

14:02.033 --> 14:04.467
I walked around like that
for a good year.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.333
I just thought to myself,

14:06.367 --> 14:08.200
There's no way
I can let this guy

14:08.233 --> 14:09.500
work a third time on me.

14:09.533 --> 14:11.333
So I decided at that point

14:11.367 --> 14:13.033
to start wearing hats.

14:13.066 --> 14:16.400
My hats basically
represent to me a security.

14:16.433 --> 14:19.266

for every occasion--

14:19.300 --> 14:22.433
baseball hat, beach hats,
fancy hats.

You name it,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.300

shadowed by my hat.

15:52.367 --> 15:54.567
Well, like,
three years ago now

15:54.600 --> 15:56.600
is when we had
the first surgery.

15:56.633 --> 15:59.467
The nose still seemed bigger
than I wanted it to be,

15:59.500 --> 16:01.767
so he suggested a year later

16:02.000 --> 16:03.233
going back
and doing a revision.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.533
What's with the hat?

with the same doctor."

something happened.

at the one-day check-in

16:24.333 --> 16:26.200

a hole in your skin?

the tissue is when it ripped.

saw that it was black,

17:06.600 --> 17:08.400
so let me try it on you.
Right. He Googled it.

17:08.433 --> 17:10.033
Right. Great.

17:10.066 --> 17:11.567
Maybe he watched my video.
Probably.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.166
Then I walked away.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.066
Yeah.
I couldn't do it.

17:15.100 --> 17:17.300
Obviously you've lost
trust at that point.
Yes.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.433
Huh.
Why go to med school

17:19.467 --> 17:22.033
when instructions
are one click away?

17:22.066 --> 17:23.433
Let's go to the exam room--
Yeah.

17:23.467 --> 17:25.300
...and take a look
at your nose.
Okay.

17:25.333 --> 17:28.567
I am aware that I'm bringing
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow

17:28.600 --> 17:31.533
a very high risk situation,
and it makes me nervous.

17:31.567 --> 17:33.033
I'm not sure I'm gonna

17:33.066 --> 17:34.333
ever undo the damage

17:34.367 --> 17:36.567
that my doctor
previously did to me.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.400
Do me a favor.
Can you sit up?

17:40.200 --> 17:42.100
So he came through
with the scalpel, I think,

17:42.133 --> 17:43.266
right through there.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

17:43.300 --> 17:45.600
Yeah. So she has
that neovascularization.

17:45.633 --> 17:46.633
Yep.
Yeah.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.066
All over the place.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.133
Neovascularization
is an indication

17:50.166 --> 17:52.533
of severe past tissue
trauma

17:52.567 --> 17:56.567
where new blood vessels
are growing into an area

17:56.600 --> 17:59.133
to try to get that area
to heal.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.633
It's a really bad sign.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.333
It really collapsed
right here.

18:02.367 --> 18:05.633
That means I have to add
cartilage along here

18:05.667 --> 18:07.600
to pop it open.

18:07.633 --> 18:09.266
Okay.
What does that mean?

18:09.300 --> 18:11.200
It'll be wider here.

18:11.233 --> 18:12.600
Get your nose straighter.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.600
I'm also gonna fix your
inside your deviated septum.

18:14.633 --> 18:16.133
Okay.

18:16.166 --> 18:17.467
Can you get a hole
through your skin again?

18:17.500 --> 18:21.500
Yes. Can your skin start
turning purple on the table?

18:21.533 --> 18:22.633
Yes.

18:22.667 --> 18:25.333
The whole tip can
turn black and die.

18:25.367 --> 18:27.200
[Stacy]
I'm completely
overwhelmed right now.

18:27.233 --> 18:28.467
That things may not turn out

18:28.500 --> 18:29.700
the way I want them
to turn out

18:29.734 --> 18:31.467
does make me feel

18:31.500 --> 18:33.500
very nervous, very afraid,

18:33.533 --> 18:35.200
and a little hesitant.

18:35.233 --> 18:37.133
One thing I can tell you
that's for sure.

18:37.166 --> 18:39.166
If your nose
starts to change--

18:39.200 --> 18:40.367
We're not gonna cover it up.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.433
Not gonna cover it up
and ignore it,

18:42.467 --> 18:45.400
but it will be
put under a microscope

18:45.433 --> 18:47.367
and treated moment by moment.

18:47.400 --> 18:48.467
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

18:48.500 --> 18:50.100
My mind is spinning,

18:50.133 --> 18:52.567
like, should I do it
or should I not do it?

18:52.600 --> 18:55.133
Should I just live
with what I have already?

18:55.166 --> 18:57.100
You are the one that's
got to make a decision.
Right.

18:57.133 --> 18:58.467
You need to make sure that
you're willing

18:58.500 --> 19:01.333
and able to go
for the third round.
Right.

19:03.633 --> 19:07.166
I think I'll go ahead
and do the surgery.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.667
So now that you've
decided to do it,

19:09.700 --> 19:13.667
you should think of it
like your mind is in the gym.

19:13.700 --> 19:15.633
You pull out whatever power

19:15.667 --> 19:17.500
for your brain
to make it happen,

19:17.533 --> 19:19.667
and then, whatever it is
you're bringing,

19:19.700 --> 19:22.266
give it to him so he can
bring it to the gym,

19:22.300 --> 19:23.700
'cause he works out
six days a week,

19:23.734 --> 19:26.266
and he's obviously
not bringing it.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.433
We'll see you soon.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.133
You have about 5 liters of fat

19:29.166 --> 19:30.700
in each buttock cheek.
Yeah.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.600
That's a lot of fat.
People think I'm crazy.

19:32.633 --> 19:34.200
That's okay.

19:34.233 --> 19:36.266

all that heat

get bigger, she said.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.500

like, world's biggest bum.

Maybe double up.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.266
Double?

21:01.300 --> 21:03.367
Yeah, but I need to gain
a lot of weight.

of our lives.

Okay.

21:56.433 --> 21:59.367
Oh, my God, let's do this.
Let's get this done.

21:59.400 --> 22:02.600
I haven't slept in three days,
and I am ready.

22:02.633 --> 22:04.367
I've been meaning
to tell you

22:04.400 --> 22:07.100
that I ate the hottest chip
in the world Saturday.

22:07.133 --> 22:09.333
Have y'all been seeing
that hottest chip?

22:09.367 --> 22:11.400
Is that the one Shaq ate?
Yes.

22:11.433 --> 22:14.533
Did you eat it?
Like a boss bitch I ate it.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.066

I'm sorry.

22:16.100 --> 22:18.333
I'm sorry, what?
I'm sorry, what?

22:18.367 --> 22:21.033
Hope's surgery today
is particularly difficult.

22:21.066 --> 22:23.734
We have a major
asymmetry problem.

22:23.767 --> 22:25.633
So the challenge

22:25.667 --> 22:28.734
to try to get
some kind of similarity

22:28.767 --> 22:30.300
between the two breasts--

22:30.333 --> 22:31.633
that's today's goal.

22:36.033 --> 22:37.533
For Hope's surgery today,

22:37.567 --> 22:39.567
I will make incisions
below her areolas,

22:39.600 --> 22:42.000
and then perform
an anterior capsulectomy

22:42.033 --> 22:44.767
to remove the front part
of the scar tissue
surrounding her implant.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.100
Next, I remove
her old implants,

22:47.133 --> 22:49.734
lift up the chest muscle,
and manipulate
the breast tissue

22:49.767 --> 22:52.066
before inserting
a smaller pair of implants,

22:52.100 --> 22:55.066
hopefully giving Hope
the symmetry
she's been chasing.

22:55.100 --> 22:57.734
Okay,
so let's go in this side

22:57.767 --> 23:00.734
and assess the pocket.

23:00.767 --> 23:04.600
Okay. Right away,
we can see she has
really thick scar tissue.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.567
This is the capsule--
this white material right there.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.166
And that's encasing
the entire implant.

23:10.200 --> 23:14.567
Ugh! This is what we call
tedious dissection right here.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.367
Okay. Let's take out
this part of the capsule.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.600
So we're doing what's called
an anterior capsulectomy,

23:19.633 --> 23:22.533
which essentially means
we're taking out the front
part of the capsule.

23:24.367 --> 23:26.066
Okay.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.367
So this is the front part
of the capsule.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.000
And now here's the implant.

23:32.166 --> 23:34.767
Okay, I'm gonna try
to lift up this muscle.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.367
By putting the implants
under the muscle,

23:38.400 --> 23:42.467
I'm providing
an extra layer of protection
overlying the implant

23:42.500 --> 23:44.633
that may help her to heal
without a complication.

23:44.667 --> 23:47.600
Okay, that is a vast
improvement in shape.

23:47.633 --> 23:50.367
That is awesome!
Not too tight?

23:50.400 --> 23:52.133
Okay, so--
Do the exact same thing.

23:52.166 --> 23:54.400
Exact same thing,
and hopefully
we may have something.

23:54.433 --> 23:57.033
Going from on top
of the muscle

23:57.066 --> 23:58.133
to under the muscle

23:58.166 --> 24:00.433
is a very tricky operation,

24:00.467 --> 24:03.500
and unless you've done it
many, many times,

24:03.533 --> 24:06.100
it can lead to a lot
of significant complications.

24:06.133 --> 24:09.133
Luckily, for Hope,
I can do this
with my eyes closed.

24:09.166 --> 24:10.633
I plan on keeping them
open, though.

24:10.667 --> 24:13.100
And it makes it
very difficult to get it up.

24:13.133 --> 24:15.000
Come on, baby.
Give me some muscle.

24:15.033 --> 24:18.200
Okay, we're under the muscle.
This is good.

24:18.233 --> 24:19.700
Could you sit her up
for a sec?
Mm.

24:19.734 --> 24:22.767
Okay, so we're submuscular
on both sides.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.233
And Hope should have
two symmetrical breasts.

24:25.266 --> 24:28.567
Ugh! So different.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.734
[bleep]

24:29.767 --> 24:31.767
What's worse than bad?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.734
Very bad.

24:35.567 --> 24:37.734

Do you wanna see me twerk?

24:37.767 --> 24:39.133
Whoa!

24:39.166 --> 24:41.133
See? I can do it too.

24:41.166 --> 24:43.400
Now, suddenly,
the acceptable left breast

24:43.433 --> 24:45.667
is no longer acceptable.

Very bad.

25:00.066 --> 25:03.600

is no longer acceptable.

25:03.633 --> 25:05.467
We gotta change the game here.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.767
In order to achieve symmetry
with the right breast,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.266
I'm gonna have to do
three things:

25:10.300 --> 25:12.600
1, release the muscle
even more

25:12.633 --> 25:14.767
to allow it to sit
properly in the pocket.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.500
2, do a lifting procedure

25:17.533 --> 25:19.734
to tighten up the envelope
around the implant.

25:19.767 --> 25:21.633
And 3, pray.

25:21.667 --> 25:24.700
The problem is this muscle
on her left

25:24.734 --> 25:28.600
is also encapsulated,
so it's very tight.

25:28.633 --> 25:32.700
It's pressing down
on the implant, giving it
a distorted appearance.

25:32.734 --> 25:36.567
So I have to actually
do a capsular release
on the muscle,

25:36.600 --> 25:38.233
which is very unusual.

25:38.266 --> 25:41.033
There's always a silver lining
to these operations,

25:41.066 --> 25:43.100
and the sliver lining
for Hope today is that

25:43.133 --> 25:47.300
because I have to do
a skin envelope tightening
of the left breast,

25:47.333 --> 25:49.633
I also have to do
an areola reduction.

25:49.667 --> 25:52.300
We have almost
symmetrical breasts.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.734
The nipple heights
are exactly the same.

25:53.767 --> 25:55.567
We've reduced
the left areola.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.734
With a little bit of luck,
she should heal this.

25:57.767 --> 25:59.734
Let's put her down.
Let's close.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.600
Let's get her
to recovery, okay?

26:06.066 --> 26:08.333
[Dubrow] Let me
ask you a question. I know
you know the answer to this.

26:08.367 --> 26:13.166
In all of plastic surgery,
what's the number 1
fastest-growing procedure

26:13.200 --> 26:14.734
in this country?
Butt.

26:14.767 --> 26:16.500
The year of the butt.
Butt augmentation.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.233
Because it's a relatively
new procedure.

26:18.266 --> 26:19.567
Now we're seeing
all the complications.

26:19.600 --> 26:22.133
Everyone wants to have
a Kardashian butt.

26:22.166 --> 26:24.000
That's just the way it is.

26:24.033 --> 26:25.667
So we have a patient
named Natasha.

26:25.700 --> 26:27.100
Look at Natasha's buttock.

26:27.133 --> 26:28.567
That's, like--
That's not real.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.033
That's real, and real big.

26:30.066 --> 26:32.133
This is a result
of fat transfer.

26:32.166 --> 26:34.166
She's wider than the door.
Oh, my God.
She's wider than the door.

26:34.200 --> 26:35.367
You're right.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.066
So her breasts
are very large,

26:37.100 --> 26:39.100
and they're droopy
and wide,

26:39.133 --> 26:40.333
but she wants
to go larger.

26:40.367 --> 26:42.333
Can you please
send in Natasha?

26:44.233 --> 26:47.000
Hello. Hi.
Natasha. Nice to meet you.

26:47.033 --> 26:48.700
Can I have a hug?
A hug? Sure.

26:48.734 --> 26:51.133
[Natasha]
I think I look really exotic.

26:51.166 --> 26:54.233
They call me Amazon.
[laughing]

26:54.266 --> 26:57.166
Hi, Natasha. How are ya?
Nice to see you.
[laughing]

26:57.200 --> 27:01.233
I think I have the curves
at the right place,

27:01.266 --> 27:03.400
but I wanna have more.

27:03.433 --> 27:05.033
That's my goal.

27:05.066 --> 27:06.233
I need a bigger chair.

27:06.266 --> 27:07.633
Wow!

27:07.667 --> 27:09.300
Okay, first question
I have to ask you.

27:09.333 --> 27:11.133
When you fly
on an airplane--
Yeah?

27:11.166 --> 27:12.700
...can you get into
an economy seat?

27:12.734 --> 27:14.700
No. I need
to have two seats.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.266
No kidding?
That's expensive, huh?
Yeah.

27:17.300 --> 27:19.066
[Nassif]
Okay, so then there is
one more question.

27:19.100 --> 27:22.100
You're walking down
the aisle in the airplane--
Yeah?

27:22.133 --> 27:25.734
I'm just walking like this,
and the bum is hitting
the people.

27:25.767 --> 27:29.033
If I go like this,
the bum is hitting people.
So it's-- Yeah.

27:29.066 --> 27:31.200
Choo, choo, choo, choo.
Well, how does that
make you feel?

27:31.233 --> 27:32.767
I think that's great.
You like it.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
Yeah. Yeah.
You like it.
That's why you did this.

27:35.033 --> 27:37.266
People think I'm crazy.
That's okay.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.600
How old are you right now?
Uh, 25.

27:39.633 --> 27:43.633
Okay. At what age did you
have your first procedure,
and what was it?

27:43.667 --> 27:45.767
When I was 20 years old.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.367
What was it?
It was Brazilian butt lift.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.200
So the first one--
do you remember

27:50.233 --> 27:52.433
how many CCs of fat
they put in each buttock?

27:52.467 --> 27:54.200
1,500.

27:54.233 --> 27:55.367
In each buttock?
Yes.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.066
Wow.
Yeah.

27:57.100 --> 27:58.600
That's a lot of fat.
That's a lot of fat.

27:58.633 --> 28:01.066
Normally, to see a difference
in a buttock,

28:01.100 --> 28:02.734
you do 300 CCs per buttock.

28:02.767 --> 28:04.300
That's just
the beginning change.
That's nothing.

28:04.333 --> 28:05.734
Well, in you it's nothing.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.133
The standard practice
in the United States

28:08.166 --> 28:11.000
is to put no more
than about 600 CCs

28:11.033 --> 28:12.767
of fat in each buttock cheek,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.433
because beyond that,
the risk of a complication,

28:15.467 --> 28:18.767
or a fat embolus breaking off
and going to the lungs--

28:19.000 --> 28:20.700
it is extraordinarily high.

28:20.734 --> 28:22.433
How much,
if you remember,
did they transfer

28:22.467 --> 28:24.333
each buttock
at the second one?
Same.

28:24.367 --> 28:26.000
Over a thousand?
Yeah.

28:26.033 --> 28:27.433
Wow.
Yeah.

28:27.467 --> 28:29.667
Okay, so you have--
So at that point--
[laughing]

28:29.700 --> 28:32.066
'Cause what we're seeing now
is after three, right?
Yeah.

28:32.100 --> 28:34.467
And how much fat did they
put in each cheek? Same?

28:34.500 --> 28:37.333
I think, like,
it was 1,300.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.767
You have about 4,500 CCs.

28:40.000 --> 28:43.467
Almost, basically, 5 liters
of fat in each buttock cheek.
Yeah.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.100
If you took
a Brazilian butt lift

28:46.133 --> 28:47.633
and put Brazil in there,

28:47.667 --> 28:49.367
it'd be smaller
than Natasha's butt.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.233
Do you work
your butt out now?
Yeah.

28:51.266 --> 28:53.100
You do squats
and stuff like that?
Yeah, I do.

28:53.133 --> 28:55.000
Because you have
a lot of muscle.
I'm twerking.

28:55.033 --> 28:56.633
[both] You twerk?
[Natasha, Tina]
Yeah.

28:56.667 --> 28:58.433
Do you wanna see me twerk?

28:58.467 --> 29:01.667
Yeah. You cool with that?
Not really.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.066
Whoa!

29:07.100 --> 29:09.000
Look at that.
Look at it.

29:09.033 --> 29:10.100
[Nassif]
That's nice muscle control,

29:10.133 --> 29:12.333
but watch this.
Watch my pecs.

29:12.367 --> 29:14.333
See? I can do it too.

29:14.367 --> 29:16.266
That's amazing
that you can do that.

29:16.300 --> 29:19.266
Boom-boom. Hmm?
Pretty impressive, huh?

29:19.300 --> 29:21.166
You've also had
breast surgery, right?
Yeah.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.100
You want them bigger?
Yes.

29:23.133 --> 29:25.367
And my nipples
are in the middle.

29:25.400 --> 29:28.000
Yeah?
I want them,
like, more down.

29:28.033 --> 29:30.734
Down?
Yeah. To have
bigger cleavage.

29:30.767 --> 29:33.133
So you want
your nipples lower?

29:33.166 --> 29:34.667
Yeah. And to the side.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.033
And to the side.
Yeah.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.467
Why on earth...

29:38.500 --> 29:40.166
Okay.
Yeah.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.233
I don't know.

29:41.266 --> 29:43.066
So let's go in,
take a look,

29:43.100 --> 29:45.667
and let's see if we can give
you some really sound advice

29:45.700 --> 29:48.000
that maybe can help you.
Okay?
Yeah.

29:48.033 --> 29:50.066
[Dubrow]
What do you think this weighs?

29:50.100 --> 29:51.500
It's probably about
a good 30 pounds.

29:51.533 --> 29:53.133
Yeah, I would say
it's about 30 pounds.

29:53.166 --> 29:56.000
Natasha's buttock
is almost as big

29:56.033 --> 29:57.400
as Paul's head.

29:57.433 --> 29:59.033
Let's take a look
at this skin.

29:59.066 --> 30:00.767
Whoa!
[Dr. Don Yoo]
Oh, damn.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.033
Blood just squirted
out of the nose.

30:06.300 --> 30:10.033
♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

30:10.066 --> 30:13.033
[Dubrow] Natasha,
let's look at the chest,
if you don't mind.

30:13.066 --> 30:16.200
So what we see here is
your breast implants

30:16.233 --> 30:18.066
are actually
located up here,

30:18.100 --> 30:20.233
and your breast tissue
is down here.

30:20.266 --> 30:23.333
So we call this
a disassociation.
Okay.

30:23.367 --> 30:25.400
So your main issue
is you want to be fuller,

30:25.433 --> 30:27.433
but you want your nipples
to be lower

30:27.467 --> 30:29.333
and further out
to the side--
Yeah.

30:29.367 --> 30:31.233
...in order to give you
more cleavage?

30:31.266 --> 30:33.166
Yeah.
Okay.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.367
Although Natasha
may want her nipples
placed down and out,

30:36.400 --> 30:39.533
the normal anatomical
position is more

30:39.567 --> 30:41.400
up and in.

30:41.433 --> 30:43.266
So, yeah,
we're not gonna do that.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.500
But, I mean, I could
theoretically do an operation

30:45.533 --> 30:49.066
where I downsize your implant
and lift them together,

30:49.100 --> 30:51.100
but you'd have to go smaller.

30:51.133 --> 30:53.100
Which I don't think
you're interested in, right?
No, I'm not.

30:53.133 --> 30:57.000
No way that I'm gonna do
my breasts smaller.

30:57.033 --> 30:58.600
No, no, no.
That's not my thing.

30:58.633 --> 31:01.066
If you wouldn't mind standing
up for a second. Okay.
Okay.

31:01.100 --> 31:03.333
When I started to do
my Brazilian butt lifts,

31:03.367 --> 31:05.133
no one did
Brazilian butt lifts.

31:05.166 --> 31:07.133
I think, like,
I was the first.

31:07.166 --> 31:11.767
I have big goals
because everything is bigger.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.467
I just want to feel
the compartment.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.233
Sometimes when you transfer
fat to the cheeks,

31:16.266 --> 31:19.233
instead of it taking,
it dies,

31:19.266 --> 31:22.333
and you can get these big masses
and nodules-- fat necrosis.

31:22.367 --> 31:25.166
But you don't appear
to have had any of that yet.
I don't have-- No.

31:25.200 --> 31:27.266
What do you think
this weighs?
[laughing]

31:27.300 --> 31:29.266
Lift this up.
Seriously, lift this up.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.033
How much would you
estimate that weighs?

31:31.066 --> 31:32.367
Probably about
a good 30 pounds.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.600
Yeah, I would say
it's about 30 pounds.

31:33.633 --> 31:36.467
Natasha's buttock
is almost as big

31:36.500 --> 31:37.600
as Paul's head.

31:37.633 --> 31:40.066
One thing I can
tell you, Natasha,

31:40.100 --> 31:43.233
what we are seeing
an explosion of in this country

31:43.266 --> 31:47.400
is that, as opposed
to getting into the areas
that you wanted,

31:47.433 --> 31:49.400
the fat gets into
the large veins,

31:49.433 --> 31:52.200
it goes up to your lungs
and blocks the circulation
to your lungs.

31:52.233 --> 31:55.133
That's called
a fat embolus.

31:55.166 --> 31:58.200
That cuts off your ability
to oxygenate your system,

31:58.233 --> 32:00.333
and that kills people.

32:00.367 --> 32:02.467
In Florida,

32:02.500 --> 32:06.233
in the last six months,
this has happened 12 times.

32:06.266 --> 32:12.133
It is the number 1
most deadly operation
in plastic surgery.

32:12.166 --> 32:14.033
[Natasha]
I'm really shocked.
I thought

32:14.066 --> 32:16.166
Brazilian butt lift
was the safest

32:16.200 --> 32:18.567
of them all
because it's your own fat.

32:18.600 --> 32:22.133
Having said this,
I want to know, Natasha,

32:22.166 --> 32:23.433
you're done?
No.

32:23.467 --> 32:25.066
You're gonna
keep doing this?
Yes.

32:25.100 --> 32:27.533
Are you gonna let her do
any more buttock surgery?

32:27.567 --> 32:29.200
I'm not going
to encourage it.

32:29.233 --> 32:32.300
I am concerned now
about Natasha. Really.

32:32.333 --> 32:36.600
It just needs a little drop
of fat to get into the system,

32:36.633 --> 32:38.467
and you can die.

32:38.500 --> 32:41.567
I was never told that.
I wouldn't do it myself.

32:41.600 --> 32:43.467
The good thing about this
is, 1,

32:43.500 --> 32:45.467
now you know
what the risks are.
Exactly.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.133
You should talk
to your doctor.

32:47.166 --> 32:50.200
Maybe, in a way, he might
recommend a smaller amount

32:50.233 --> 32:52.200
to minimize the risks.

32:52.233 --> 32:54.633
That's the best advice
we can give you. Okay?

32:54.667 --> 32:58.266
And so I hope
you'll take it to heart,
consider it very carefully.

32:58.300 --> 32:59.700
Pleasure meeting you,
Natasha.
Thank you.

32:59.734 --> 33:01.533
Thank you.
Pleasure meeting you, Tina.
Thank you.

33:01.567 --> 33:03.533
I started with a goal,

33:03.567 --> 33:05.700
and I'm gonna do
whatever I want.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.400
You're gonna hate me now.
No.

33:08.433 --> 33:10.533
New rules.
No rules.

33:10.567 --> 33:13.333
I would rather live
a short life--

33:13.367 --> 33:17.166
that is, like, 50 years--
and do whatever I wanna do

33:17.200 --> 33:20.500
instead of living
long life but boring.

33:20.533 --> 33:23.300
Come on.
No one wants a boring life.

33:23.333 --> 33:24.467
[laughing]

33:24.500 --> 33:26.100
But you must be careful.

33:26.133 --> 33:27.367
I will.

33:30.667 --> 33:34.500
Good morning.
Oh, no baseball cap.
No cap.

33:34.533 --> 33:36.333
You know Dr. Don Yoo.
Yes.

33:36.367 --> 33:39.300
So, first of all,
your profile's gonna be

33:39.333 --> 33:41.367
a definite improvement, okay?
Okay.

33:41.400 --> 33:43.467
Matter of fact,
here we go.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.400
That's a nice transformation.
Yeah.

33:45.433 --> 33:49.500
Your skin is not
gonna react kindly
to me operating on it.

33:49.533 --> 33:52.367
Hopefully it's not
gonna really hate me
and turn black.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.633
And we'll see you soon.
Okay.

33:57.533 --> 34:00.734
Today my team will harvest rib
while I open Stacy's nose.

34:00.767 --> 34:03.633
Next, we'll take down
the nasal hump
and fracture the bones

34:03.667 --> 34:06.166
to bring them in
and improve her profile.

34:06.200 --> 34:09.266
Then we will use
septal extension
replacement grafts

34:09.300 --> 34:12.667
made from rib cartilage
to open up her airway
and elevate her nasal tip,

34:12.700 --> 34:15.633
leaving Stacy with a more
aesthetically pleasing nose.

34:15.667 --> 34:17.700
Let's take a look
at this skin.

34:17.734 --> 34:20.266
So I can already tell--
the tip dissection--

34:20.300 --> 34:22.166
that there is a lot
of scar tissue present.

34:22.200 --> 34:24.433
Whoa!
Oh, damn.

34:24.467 --> 34:26.266
Blood just squirted
out of the nose.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.667
Okay, stop the bleeding.

34:27.700 --> 34:31.333
So our goal here is to stay
as deep as possible.

34:31.367 --> 34:35.266
This is where it's really risky
to pop into the nasal skin.

34:35.300 --> 34:37.300
You're, like, at a--
I'm really thin, Christine?

34:37.333 --> 34:39.400
Well, yeah.

right below your--

34:39.433 --> 34:41.533
Oh, look.
She has Prolene stitches
everywhere.

34:41.567 --> 34:43.200
I have no clue why this doctor

34:43.233 --> 34:44.667
put permanent stitches
inside the nose.

34:44.700 --> 34:47.533
And on top of that,
many of them.

34:47.567 --> 34:50.433
This is the hardest
nasal dissection I've had

34:50.467 --> 34:52.367
in almost 15 years.

34:52.400 --> 34:54.400
Okay, dissected
out the septum.

34:54.433 --> 34:56.400
And now
what we're gonna do is

34:56.433 --> 34:59.433
take down the nasal hump,
fracture the nasal bones.

34:59.467 --> 35:01.233
Give me a long scissors.

35:03.266 --> 35:04.700
There's the small hump
removed.

35:04.734 --> 35:07.433
Got the rib yet, Don?
I do.

35:07.467 --> 35:09.533
Oh, look at that!
Like giving birth.

35:09.567 --> 35:12.300
Good job, Doctor.
Now what we're gonna do is

35:12.333 --> 35:14.600
put a septal extension graft
in the tip,

35:14.633 --> 35:16.433
put in replacement grafts,

35:16.467 --> 35:18.333
see how we can make
the tip smaller.

35:18.367 --> 35:23.333
Stacy's tip is a big,
fat conglomerate of scar.

35:23.367 --> 35:25.233
I have nothing.
I have no form.

35:25.266 --> 35:28.000
I have to just remove
everything and start fresh

35:28.033 --> 35:29.600
and build a nose
from the ground up.

35:29.633 --> 35:31.767
Give me an aufricht.
And let's go ahead

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
and put those lateral
crural strut grafts in.

35:34.033 --> 35:36.033
This is a lateral
crural strut graft.

35:36.066 --> 35:37.233
Let me see.

35:39.066 --> 35:42.033
The airway looks good.
The contour looks good.

35:42.066 --> 35:45.734
The tip looks good.
It's still not gonna be
very small.

35:45.767 --> 35:49.400
But I think, at this point,
it's gone better
than I expected.

35:49.433 --> 35:51.500
Thank you all.
Thank you.

35:51.533 --> 35:53.567

that I didn't puncture
Stacy's skin.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.500
The tip is better.

35:55.533 --> 35:57.633
It really depends on
how Stacy's gonna heal.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.567
Good morning.
Well, hello.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.300
How are you?
I'm good.

36:04.333 --> 36:06.567
So you must be
in serious pain.

36:06.600 --> 36:09.467
"Serious" is not the word
for the pain that I'm in, yeah.
Right.

36:09.500 --> 36:13.467
Big time.
I wanted to put you
under the muscle.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.300
So that's why you're in
so much pain.

36:15.333 --> 36:18.767
I had to actually do
a capsular release
of the muscle.

36:19.000 --> 36:23.000
'Cause the muscle--
I lifted it up, but it was
pressing down on the implant,

36:23.033 --> 36:25.633
giving it this strange contour,
so I had to-- tchoo--

36:25.667 --> 36:28.400
do a capsule release
of the muscle
to open things up,

36:28.433 --> 36:30.367
which is very unusual.

36:30.400 --> 36:32.500
Let's see what
you look like, okay?
Yes.

36:32.533 --> 36:36.367

be so excited to see
my mom's boobs, ever.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.367

36:38.400 --> 36:41.367
I hope she gets her nipples
like she asked for.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.400
So the question for today is
do you have any inordinate
amount of bleeding?

36:45.433 --> 36:48.033
If there are any issues.
So let's look.

36:48.066 --> 36:50.500

Don't they look good?
