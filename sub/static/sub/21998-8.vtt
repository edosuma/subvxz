WEBVTT

00:00.594 --> 00:02.647
Our dad died, and it's very sad, okay?

00:02.672 --> 00:04.545
- Previously on This is Us...

00:04.570 --> 00:06.959
- Come on, Kev.
- You never talk about it.

00:06.984 --> 00:09.444
Well, you know, 'cause I don't want
to wallow in sadness about it,

00:09.445 --> 00:11.256
- I have a problem?
- Okay, there's a difference between

00:11.280 --> 00:13.757
wallowing and actually having
a normal conversation about it.

00:13.977 --> 00:17.647
I wasn't good at football, Toby.
I was great.

00:20.328 --> 00:21.937
Listen, I was just hoping we could get

00:21.962 --> 00:23.421
one more refill on the prescription.

00:23.446 --> 00:25.367
I-I don't know
why it's that big of a deal.

00:27.040 --> 00:30.445
Kevin, you're-you're spiraling.

00:30.470 --> 00:32.125
What's going on? This isn't you.

00:32.150 --> 00:34.078
When I dream of our future together,

00:35.246 --> 00:37.080
Sophie, it's a nightmare.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.126
- Okay.
- Okay, who's gonna do it?

00:40.150 --> 00:42.952
- Who's gonna be the first one to walk?
- Who's gonna do it?

00:42.977 --> 00:44.993
- We know you want to.
- Come on. We know you want to so bad.

00:45.017 --> 00:45.976
Come on, guys.

00:46.001 --> 00:48.069
- Number One is up. He's up!
- Kevin's up!

00:48.094 --> 00:51.101
- Come on.
- Come on! Come here. Come here, boy.

00:51.126 --> 00:53.242
- Look at that, Kevin
Pearson, first one born,

00:53.267 --> 00:56.491
first one to walk. He's on his feet.
Look at him come down the track.

00:56.516 --> 00:58.164
- Ladies and gentlemen!
- Yes, buddy!

00:58.189 --> 00:59.665
- He's walking. There he goes!
- Look at those steps!

01:00.802 --> 01:02.117
Yeah! You did it!

01:02.142 --> 01:04.480
Number One. Number One.

01:04.506 --> 01:07.274
Is there nothing Number One can't do?

02:03.607 --> 02:06.350
Hello, again, everyone, and
welcome to another great matchup

02:06.375 --> 02:08.144
on Sunday Night Football.

02:08.178 --> 02:10.678
Mr. Pearson? Housekeeping!

02:10.703 --> 02:12.036
You in there?

02:12.061 --> 02:13.265
...in four nights, when
we go to Washington

02:13.290 --> 02:14.867
for the big Thanksgiving night game.

02:14.987 --> 02:16.954
- Mr. Pearson?
- Al, people can eat all day long

02:16.999 --> 02:19.000
- You there?
- and then get ready for the big ga...

02:22.851 --> 02:25.093
Do you need service, sir?

02:25.351 --> 02:26.976
Maybe some clean towels?

02:27.001 --> 02:28.992
The "Do not disturb" sign's
been up all week.

02:29.017 --> 02:31.023
Yet here we are, huh?

02:31.653 --> 02:32.851
Disturbing.

02:33.773 --> 02:36.914
I'm... Come on, I'm messing
around with you, uh... Martina.

02:36.939 --> 02:39.335
Like Navratilova, right?
The tennis player.

02:39.401 --> 02:41.328
Yeah? You play tennis?

02:41.593 --> 02:44.351
I don't play either.
She was great, though, huh?

02:44.406 --> 02:46.851
She was great. Not much of a looker,

02:46.876 --> 02:48.757
but she had a great backhand.

02:49.531 --> 02:51.234
Maybe it was a forehand...

02:51.561 --> 02:52.648
Remember.

02:53.869 --> 02:56.037
So, do you want some towels?

02:56.071 --> 02:58.839
Uh... No, you know what,
I'm all set on towels.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.265
But since you're here, Martina,

03:00.290 --> 03:01.726
and we're already
mid-disturb, come on in.

03:01.751 --> 03:04.234
We could use a refill
on all things alcohol-related.

03:09.984 --> 03:12.117
Maybe I should change your sheets, too.

03:12.142 --> 03:14.484
Yeah, no, go nuts.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.024
Kate, how many times
do I have to tell you?

03:17.059 --> 03:19.468
You don't have to call me every
15 seconds. I am fine, okay?

03:19.493 --> 03:21.961
Mr. Pearson? Hi. This is Kelly,

03:21.986 --> 03:24.203
the homecoming coordinator
from McKinley High.

03:24.331 --> 03:25.798
We spoke last month.

03:25.823 --> 03:28.791
- Right. Yeah, now is not a good time.
- Oh, my God.

03:28.816 --> 03:31.281
I've never talked to a
celebrity on the phone before.

03:31.306 --> 03:32.973
Except for Ryan Seacrest

03:32.998 --> 03:35.299
that time I phoned in
and won Zayn Malik tickets.

03:36.648 --> 03:38.984
Get it together, Kelly.

03:39.114 --> 03:43.242
I'm, uh, just confirming you are
all set for tomorrow night?

03:43.562 --> 03:45.617
Uh... tomorrow night...

03:45.642 --> 03:48.406
Alumni Honors Ceremony. Go, Lions!

03:48.431 --> 03:50.671
That's not tomorrow, though.
That-That's in, like...

03:50.696 --> 03:52.530
that's in, like, two weeks. That's...

03:52.555 --> 03:53.689
that's-that's the 20th.

03:53.962 --> 03:56.867
Uh-huh, yeah, t-tomorrow is the 20th.

03:57.147 --> 03:59.915
Martina, what day is tomorrow?

03:59.940 --> 04:01.407
Tomorrow's the 20th.

04:03.070 --> 04:04.265
Tomor...

04:04.290 --> 04:05.851
Excuse me, Martina, wha...

04:05.887 --> 04:08.070
I'm on the phone with, uh...
What do they call you?

04:08.511 --> 04:10.015
Oh, sorry. Kelly.

04:10.131 --> 04:12.218
Mr. Pearson, are you not coming?

04:12.243 --> 04:15.000
Because everyone here is really excited

04:15.025 --> 04:16.459
about giving you this honor.

04:16.485 --> 04:18.119
Old high school wants to honor me.

04:18.283 --> 04:20.733
- Should I go?
- Is it outside this room?

04:21.372 --> 04:23.179
If it's outside, you should go.

04:23.204 --> 04:25.640
I mean, I was gonna go back east
for Thanksgiving anyway.

04:25.835 --> 04:27.726
Sorry, are-are you still
talking to me or...?

04:27.751 --> 04:28.885
- Martina.
- Yeah?

04:28.910 --> 04:30.718
No, I was answering, uh...

04:31.114 --> 04:32.218
Kelly.

04:36.398 --> 04:38.914
You guys want to honor Kevin Pearson?

04:40.585 --> 04:41.765
Let's honor him.

04:42.601 --> 04:44.546
Maybe bathe him, too.

05:16.445 --> 05:18.562
Jack! Fuse!

05:18.587 --> 05:20.437
Yeah! I'm working on it!

05:21.159 --> 05:22.851
Could you work a little faster?!

05:27.093 --> 05:29.984
Hey, Ivy League, you think
you could help me figure out

05:30.009 --> 05:32.031
which one of these
is for the first floor?

05:32.379 --> 05:33.898
I'm not Ivy League yet.

05:37.765 --> 05:38.843
Killing me.

05:38.868 --> 05:41.531
Sorry to have interrupted
your evening, my liege.

05:41.708 --> 05:44.710
- How's your Harvard application coming?
- Almost done.

05:45.207 --> 05:46.992
- Oh, thank God.
- Fixed it!

05:47.017 --> 05:48.382
Good job, babe!

05:49.244 --> 05:50.867
Wait, wait, is that what you're wearing?

05:50.892 --> 05:53.943
- Mm-hmm. -The coach from Pitt
is gonna be here any second.

05:53.968 --> 05:56.648
You should really stop borrowing
shirts from Sophie, Kevin.

05:56.673 --> 05:58.307
I don't really think
the coach is gonna care

05:58.332 --> 05:59.832
what shirt I'm wearing.

05:59.857 --> 06:01.296
Whatever, Crop Top.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.179
Ew! What is that flavor?

06:04.204 --> 06:07.710
It's orange zest. I panicked
and added it last minute.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.702
Can you please go put on
a collared shirt

06:09.727 --> 06:11.226
and a nice pair of pants?

06:12.554 --> 06:14.937
You think we can, like,
move Dad's AA stuff?

06:15.023 --> 06:16.871
Yes, we can do that.

06:16.905 --> 06:18.476
- It's been, like, six months.
- Mm-hmm.

06:18.501 --> 06:20.900
- And it takes as long as it takes.
- Change.

06:20.925 --> 06:22.376
- Well, it's just so lame...
- So I think

06:22.410 --> 06:24.211
the power's gonna hold.

06:24.246 --> 06:26.814
You ready to wow this
coach, college boy?

06:26.937 --> 06:28.303
God, it's just Pitt, you know?

06:28.328 --> 06:29.734
I didn't even really want
to meet with the guy.

06:29.759 --> 06:31.125
Yeah. We know.

06:31.339 --> 06:34.239
Go put on a collared shirt, though,
and some pants with a fly.

06:34.373 --> 06:35.835
- It's just Pitt.
- Now.

06:51.807 --> 06:53.742
- Welcome to Pittsburgh, Kevin.
- Thank you.

06:53.813 --> 06:57.101
We are obsessed with The Manny.
Is the beard for a movie or...?

06:57.145 --> 06:58.646
- Yeah.
- Can we get a picture?

07:02.254 --> 07:03.726
That's gonna be a good one.

07:07.815 --> 07:10.195
Are you, uh, visiting or coming home?

07:10.792 --> 07:12.617
Uh... just...

07:12.824 --> 07:13.929
Neither.

07:14.937 --> 07:16.960
Both. I don't... I don't...
I don't know.

07:17.203 --> 07:19.664
Well, let me know
if you need anything, uh,

07:19.689 --> 07:21.289
water or a phone charger.

07:21.314 --> 07:22.781
Running a little low on painkillers.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.367
Hook me up with some of those?

07:27.976 --> 07:30.203
I-I... don't really, um...

07:30.228 --> 07:31.679
I'm joking, man. Come
on, give me a break.

07:31.704 --> 07:32.765
You should've seen your face.

07:32.790 --> 07:33.875
It was classic.

07:34.469 --> 07:36.504
Hey-ey, uh, make a left...

07:37.085 --> 07:38.285
make a left right here.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.621
- The high school's actually...
- Yeah, no, no. Quick detour.

07:40.724 --> 07:42.414
Okay. No problem.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.546
Stop, stop, stop. Right here.

08:16.524 --> 08:18.325
...right past Mom. Pump fake to you.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.398
Okay? Number One, it's coming to you.

08:20.423 --> 08:22.224
Leap into the driveway by the street.

08:22.249 --> 08:24.304
Okay? Right. This one's coming
to you, Number One.

08:24.329 --> 08:25.421
One, two. One, two.

08:25.446 --> 08:26.531
Okay, okay!

08:26.556 --> 08:29.691
Ho-ho! Okay, go 42!

08:29.859 --> 08:31.564
Go 42!

08:32.226 --> 08:33.203
Set!

08:33.695 --> 08:37.044
- Hut, hut!
- One, 1,000, two, 1,000, three!

08:37.078 --> 08:38.846
You're not supposed to blitz!
You're not supposed to blitz!

08:38.880 --> 08:41.181
I'm running! Go, go, go! You got it!

08:41.216 --> 08:42.683
You got it! Oh, get it, get it, get it!

08:44.386 --> 08:46.387
He got it! He got it!

08:49.224 --> 08:50.414
Hey.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.863
Can I help you?

08:52.765 --> 08:54.085
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:05.250 --> 09:08.023
Kate, can you clean his
pee anywhere else?

09:08.041 --> 09:10.342
A college coach is gonna
be sitting on that couch.

09:10.376 --> 09:12.010
Okay, well, I'm not
getting it on anything.

09:12.045 --> 09:13.890
And, uh, speaking of college,

09:14.171 --> 09:16.014
have you made your list yet?

09:16.049 --> 09:18.450
Your guidance counselor
said to make a list

09:18.485 --> 09:20.786
of your top five schools,
'cause you don't want to put

09:20.820 --> 09:22.187
- all your eggs...
- In one basket.

09:22.222 --> 09:24.356
- He's here!
- Okay! Okay, okay.

09:24.390 --> 09:26.359
I'm out.

09:27.578 --> 09:29.528
- Hey, knock 'em dead.
- Train your dog.

09:29.562 --> 09:30.781
Make that list!

09:32.132 --> 09:33.195
Yeah.

09:35.140 --> 09:37.402
- Coach Waltering.
- Jack, how are you?

09:37.437 --> 09:38.704
How are you? Come on in, please.

09:38.738 --> 09:40.210
This is my wife Rebecca.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.406
So nice to meet you.

09:41.441 --> 09:42.975
- Thank you for coming over, Coach.
- Of course.

09:43.009 --> 09:45.046
- Very nice to meet you as well.
- Hey.

09:45.601 --> 09:49.343
And there he is!
Kevin Pearson, superstar.

09:49.749 --> 09:51.531
How you doing? Coach Waltering.

10:13.343 --> 10:14.445
Sophie?

10:24.517 --> 10:25.671
Kevin.

10:29.774 --> 10:30.913
You're back.

10:32.625 --> 10:34.085
Mr. Pearson.

10:34.294 --> 10:36.210
Mr. Pearson, you're early.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.914
We are beyond stoked to have you.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.031
My Snapchat is legit blowing up.

10:41.421 --> 10:42.695
Do you mind?

10:43.803 --> 10:46.123
Now, the Honors Ceremony

10:46.148 --> 10:47.773
won't start for a couple of hours,

10:47.807 --> 10:50.375
but we've got, like,
a greenroom set up for you.

10:50.410 --> 10:53.045
You probably think it's super
lame, us doing a greenroom.

10:53.079 --> 10:54.813
I know you've been in real greenrooms.

10:54.848 --> 10:58.046
But, uh, we got La Croix water
and Wi-Fi.

11:00.304 --> 11:01.445
Are you okay?

11:02.055 --> 11:03.843
Yeah. Just, uh...

11:06.500 --> 11:09.127
You look so much like somebody
I knew when I went here.

11:09.820 --> 11:11.964
Oh. Someone pretty, I hope.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.257
I'm gonna go...

11:14.359 --> 11:16.851
- go walk the halls for a bit here.
- Yeah.

11:18.109 --> 11:20.687
Well, I will just,
uh, see you later, then.

11:23.093 --> 11:25.414
Hey, is the beard for a movie, or...?

11:26.476 --> 11:27.804
It's probably for a movie.

11:51.178 --> 11:53.585
Now, I'm here to tell you, kid,
that with that arm

11:53.779 --> 11:55.914
and my guidance,
you could be on your way

11:55.939 --> 11:57.406
to joining the great tradition

11:57.431 --> 12:00.389
of Pennsylvania-grown
quarterbacks: Joe Montana...

12:00.414 --> 12:02.547
- He went to Notre Dame.
- Kevin.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.226
What?

12:04.765 --> 12:06.085
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

12:06.218 --> 12:08.554
What kid doesn't want to play QB
for the Irish, right?

12:26.235 --> 12:29.085
You will be taking a lot
of snaps next year.

12:29.789 --> 12:31.777
Well, am I gonna start?

12:35.581 --> 12:38.884
Excuse me, Coach, our son seems
to have forgotten his manners.

12:38.968 --> 12:41.653
Well, Kevin, you might not start,

12:41.828 --> 12:43.422
but you may very well finish.

12:43.456 --> 12:45.945
Now, let's talk
about the players drafted

12:45.970 --> 12:48.125
to the NFL from our program...

13:17.435 --> 13:18.736
Get out of my sight.

13:19.348 --> 13:21.078
- Okay.
- Get...

13:21.978 --> 13:23.572
back here.

13:25.018 --> 13:26.179
Okay.

13:27.289 --> 13:28.468
That man...

13:29.811 --> 13:32.265
He takes time out of his day,

13:32.290 --> 13:35.875
he comes to our home,
he sits at our table,

13:35.900 --> 13:38.210
and he offers you, a C-plus student

13:38.244 --> 13:40.375
- at best...
- You invited him, not me.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.945
...a full ride to a good college!

13:43.468 --> 13:46.304
- We can do better.
- Kevin, that is not the point.

13:46.552 --> 13:50.122
Do you have... any idea

13:50.156 --> 13:52.742
how lucky you are to get
an opportunity like that?

13:52.767 --> 13:55.039
It's not luck. It's talent.

13:59.304 --> 14:00.437
Okay.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.328
You get your ass downstairs,

14:04.242 --> 14:06.171
and you write him an apology letter.

14:06.234 --> 14:07.828
- Now.
- Why?

14:08.156 --> 14:10.675
Because you've been apologizing
to the world lately?

14:10.710 --> 14:12.218
- Kevin, it's part of his 12 Steps.
- 12 Steps.

14:12.243 --> 14:13.429
I know that.

14:17.839 --> 14:21.109
Do you have something
you want to say to me?

14:23.671 --> 14:26.164
Do you... have something...

14:27.175 --> 14:28.601
you want to say to me?

14:30.696 --> 14:31.750
Nope.

14:33.694 --> 14:35.289
Go do what your dad says.

14:38.204 --> 14:39.500
It was embarrassing

14:40.395 --> 14:43.331
to watch you behave just like you did.

14:44.349 --> 14:45.976
I know the feeling well.

14:54.414 --> 14:55.984
Can I get you something to drink?

14:56.273 --> 14:57.365
What do you have?

14:57.390 --> 14:59.304
There's red, and there's white,

14:59.429 --> 15:02.093
- and there's water...
- Red is great. Thank you.

15:07.710 --> 15:09.429
- Hey. Kevin Pearson.
- Oh.

15:09.462 --> 15:11.496
- Yeah, hi. Good.
- Oh, you're just...

15:11.596 --> 15:12.929
Hi. Hi. Just...

15:14.471 --> 15:15.640
Good God.

15:19.101 --> 15:20.210
Oh.

15:21.304 --> 15:22.881
Guess you don't need a name tag.

15:23.601 --> 15:25.717
- Sorry.
- Everyone knows you're Kevin Pearson.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.552
- Yeah.
- Me? Well, I need a name tag.

15:27.587 --> 15:29.087
Lived here my whole life,

15:29.122 --> 15:31.256
face still hasn't lost
its baby weight, and God knows

15:31.290 --> 15:33.058
I haven't changed my hair
since I was 16,

15:33.092 --> 15:35.171
- but I still need a name tag.
- Oh.

15:35.671 --> 15:37.140
We went to school together.

15:37.936 --> 15:40.835
- This school.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh...

15:41.144 --> 15:42.539
You can use the name tag.

15:42.992 --> 15:45.835
- Charlotte Everby...
- Everly.

15:46.828 --> 15:48.851
- Wow. Okay. Everly.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.443
I wa... I was supposed to get
my hands on-on one of those.

15:51.477 --> 15:53.011
- She-she... -Oh, please,
you can have a sip of mine.

15:53.045 --> 15:54.046
- Oh.
- Uh, it's awful.

15:54.071 --> 15:54.864
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:54.889 --> 15:56.662
Uh, grapes crushed by real Italian feet.

15:56.687 --> 15:58.093
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

15:58.359 --> 15:59.670
Boy, that is gross.

15:59.695 --> 16:01.253
That is really foot-forward.

16:01.287 --> 16:03.265
It is totally foot-forward.

16:05.614 --> 16:08.516
Oh, God, did I have a mad crush
on you back then.

16:08.859 --> 16:11.328
I mean, you were... everything.

16:11.507 --> 16:13.382
You made us want to come to school.

16:14.265 --> 16:15.718
- Us?
- The nerds.

16:15.946 --> 16:17.802
And the girls. The gays.

16:17.837 --> 16:19.695
Basically, everyone.

16:20.632 --> 16:23.101
Um, heard that you
and Sophie got divorced?

16:23.335 --> 16:25.000
Uh, yeah. We did. But we...

16:25.028 --> 16:27.125
- but we got back together.
- Oh.

16:27.150 --> 16:29.062
And then I managed to
screw that up, too.

16:30.383 --> 16:31.898
Hmm.

16:34.921 --> 16:36.921
My sister Kate. You remember Kate?

16:36.960 --> 16:39.242
I remember you two
being inseparable. How is she?

16:39.267 --> 16:41.585
Good. She's, uh... pregnant.

16:41.906 --> 16:43.495
No. No, no, no.

16:43.529 --> 16:46.179
I wasn't supposed to, uh,
tell that to anyone.

16:46.562 --> 16:49.670
So... you know,
don't tell anyone, or her,

16:49.695 --> 16:51.469
- that I told you.
- So I shouldn't tweet it?

16:51.504 --> 16:52.971
You should not tweet it, no.

16:53.005 --> 16:54.706
Yeah, so wha-what do you, uh...?
Do you have kids here?

16:54.740 --> 16:56.921
- Are you a parent here, or...?
- Uh, fellow honoree.

16:57.023 --> 16:58.701
- Oh.
- For my work as a plastic surgeon.

16:58.726 --> 17:01.373
- Butts or boobs?
- Burn victims mostly.

17:01.398 --> 17:03.181
- Right.
- Yeah. Skin grafts and such.

17:03.216 --> 17:04.648
- Right.
- And twice a year, I go

17:04.684 --> 17:06.232
to developing countries
with Operation Smile,

17:06.257 --> 17:08.281
- so that kids with cleft palates...
- Mmm.

17:08.306 --> 17:10.078
- Oh, um...
- Thank you.

17:11.311 --> 17:13.093
- Oh.
- Yeah.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.162
Someone's a little nervous
about his speech.

17:17.195 --> 17:18.608
Yeah.

17:18.965 --> 17:20.671
- Uh...
- I got to give a speech?

17:22.796 --> 17:26.429
Now, I know you think this is
a man who needs no introduction

17:26.680 --> 17:29.164
but there's someone here
who begs to differ.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.070
Coming out of retirement
to present Kevin

17:32.095 --> 17:34.117
with his Distinguished Alum Award,

17:34.249 --> 17:37.976
his former football coach,
Duffy "The Duff" Collins.

17:38.366 --> 17:39.899
Duff! Duff!

17:40.427 --> 17:42.906
Duff! Duff! Duff!
Duff! Duff! Duff! Duff!

17:43.627 --> 17:45.261
Duff! Duff! Duff! Duff!

17:50.246 --> 17:51.483
Hey, Duff!

17:52.384 --> 17:53.765
Well, thank you for that.

17:54.541 --> 17:58.125
I, uh... I had the pleasure
of coaching Kevin

17:58.150 --> 18:00.773
for four yea... well,
three and a half years.

18:01.804 --> 18:05.296
And in my career, I never saw a
kid with so much natural talent,

18:06.784 --> 18:09.429
confidence or charisma.

18:10.995 --> 18:12.829
But he caught some tough breaks

18:13.945 --> 18:15.507
and suffered some losses.

18:16.867 --> 18:19.679
And that's when he really
showed himself to be a star.

18:25.667 --> 18:28.843
He fought through the adversity
and the heartache.

18:29.603 --> 18:33.234
And he found success on another path.

18:35.816 --> 18:37.093
He is,

18:39.007 --> 18:40.523
for all you kids out there,

18:42.429 --> 18:45.312
a living, breathing example

18:45.337 --> 18:47.789
of outer and inner strength.

18:50.171 --> 18:51.812
This kid is tough as hell.

18:53.983 --> 18:55.281
Kevin, I know

18:56.324 --> 19:01.164
this little award
may not be much to you...

19:01.392 --> 19:04.820
But for me, who knew you when,

19:05.485 --> 19:07.273
who knew your father...

19:09.870 --> 19:12.320
You coming
back here to get this award...

19:14.454 --> 19:16.476
We are all very proud.

19:48.005 --> 19:49.218
Uh...

19:50.670 --> 19:52.093
well, thank you.

19:54.906 --> 19:56.195
You're a... good man.

19:57.985 --> 19:59.632
But what you said was wrong.

20:00.148 --> 20:02.242
I'm-I'm...

20:02.267 --> 20:06.125
It's not, uh, funny.
I'm serious, guys. Uh,

20:08.796 --> 20:10.000
I'm not strong.

20:10.265 --> 20:11.367
At all. Uh...

20:13.318 --> 20:15.578
- We love you, Kevin!
- Love you, Kevin!

20:15.617 --> 20:17.054
But, uh...

20:18.023 --> 20:20.187
Stop, don't. Don't do that. Don't.

20:20.533 --> 20:22.632
Don't-don't... don't love me.

20:25.510 --> 20:28.335
You, uh, you guys want
to love someone, love Paul here.

20:28.789 --> 20:31.789
A newspaper man in...
let's face it... a dying medium.

20:31.814 --> 20:34.921
Or Dr. Everly, a woman who...

20:37.282 --> 20:39.992
...who helps messed up kids
go out and face the world.

20:43.196 --> 20:44.351
The truth is, I...

20:45.253 --> 20:46.960
I'm not worthy of this award.

20:48.408 --> 20:50.015
Or any honor, for that matter.

20:51.686 --> 20:52.788
So...

20:53.131 --> 20:54.250
Uh...

21:15.617 --> 21:17.234
Can't sleep either, huh?

21:17.494 --> 21:18.953
Um, just hungry,

21:18.978 --> 21:20.734
and we don't have anything good to eat.

21:23.421 --> 21:25.921
Listen, I wanted to talk to you.

21:25.946 --> 21:27.203
Your brother,

21:27.228 --> 21:29.906
he wants to tour this college on Friday,

21:30.845 --> 21:32.012
and it's in D.C.

21:32.037 --> 21:34.164
I'm-I'm probably gonna miss
your football game.

21:35.492 --> 21:36.609
It's fine.

21:40.163 --> 21:41.703
What happened earlier tonight...

21:43.500 --> 21:44.687
how mad I got?

21:44.840 --> 21:47.656
My fuse has been very short lately

21:47.681 --> 21:49.382
with everything that I'm dealing with.

21:50.601 --> 21:51.859
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

21:53.239 --> 21:54.406
It wasn't right.

21:55.768 --> 21:56.921
Okay.

22:02.589 --> 22:03.937
What's going on with you, Kev?

22:04.496 --> 22:06.359
Nothing, Dad. I just, uh...

22:06.761 --> 22:08.304
I got to go write that letter.

22:37.892 --> 22:39.101
Yeah, I...

22:41.000 --> 22:42.125
Look...

22:45.021 --> 22:46.304
Look, it's all just...

22:47.234 --> 22:50.226
You know, it was just
really steep tonight, Charlie.

22:51.687 --> 22:54.507
Yeah... No, I've... I've said it,

22:54.532 --> 22:56.812
uh, said it about a hundred times.

22:59.940 --> 23:01.015
Yeah.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.125
Yeah. Okay. I'll do it right now.

23:06.389 --> 23:07.929
Thanks for being there.

23:22.117 --> 23:23.789
God, grant me the serenity

23:23.814 --> 23:25.715
to accept the things I cannot change,

23:25.740 --> 23:28.710
the courage to change the things I can,

23:29.040 --> 23:31.632
and the wisdom to know the difference.

23:37.961 --> 23:40.226
All right, so, we're gonna see
you guys after Kev's game?

23:40.251 --> 23:41.429
- Yes.
- Dad, come on.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.208
It's a four-hour drive.
I don't want to get there late

23:43.242 --> 23:44.335
and make a bad impression.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.396
Randall, you're a math prodigy

23:46.421 --> 23:48.389
with insane SAT scores
and perfect grades.

23:48.414 --> 23:51.421
Any college would be lucky
to have a giant dork like you.

23:51.446 --> 23:52.656
Thanks, LL Cool K.

23:53.442 --> 23:55.076
So, you guys out?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.109
Yeah. Sorry we're missing your game.

23:57.134 --> 23:58.523
Next campus tour's a month away.

23:58.548 --> 24:00.491
That's fine, man. I've got enough fans

24:00.526 --> 24:01.893
in the stands cheering me on.

24:01.927 --> 24:04.437
- -That's a nice
attitude adjustment, Kev.

24:05.070 --> 24:07.414
I'm glad that talk really sunk in.

24:09.046 --> 24:10.804
- See you later.
- Mmm. Okay.

24:11.812 --> 24:13.656
Travel safe. I love you.

24:13.681 --> 24:14.804
Love you, too, Mom.

24:27.819 --> 24:29.144
Amazing speech, man.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.255
Can we get a picture for the yearbook?

24:31.680 --> 24:33.320
And, uh, one for me.

24:35.961 --> 24:38.429
Great job. Great speech.

24:38.464 --> 24:40.698
Awesome job, Kevin. So ins...

24:40.733 --> 24:42.187
Amazing.

24:52.300 --> 24:53.484
Great job.

25:03.677 --> 25:05.640
Hey. You want to walk?

25:11.109 --> 25:13.296
They retired my jersey.
Do you know that?

25:13.665 --> 25:16.054
- Yeah.
- You know what it was, the number?

25:16.631 --> 25:17.710
One.

25:17.953 --> 25:19.804
Well, you couldn't ask
for a better number.

25:19.838 --> 25:21.523
Didn't ask for it. Just got it.

25:22.218 --> 25:25.398
I was, uh, first born in my family,

25:25.423 --> 25:27.320
so it was, like...

25:27.914 --> 25:30.562
already my nickname.
You know, I was branded at birth.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.153
Very first one to learn how to walk.

25:35.187 --> 25:37.992
I was, I was, I was always, you know,

25:38.017 --> 25:40.186
first one picked in any sports team.

25:41.710 --> 25:44.320
I was the first boy
to kiss a girl in school.

25:46.367 --> 25:47.562
Number One.

25:47.642 --> 25:50.101
First grown man to get drunk
in a high school quad?

25:50.339 --> 25:51.726
That was Jim Kalotchnik.

25:53.101 --> 25:54.438
Oh, the janitor.

25:54.473 --> 25:55.873
That's right.

25:55.908 --> 25:58.376
I always thought that his legs
were different lengths,

25:58.410 --> 26:00.203
- but I guess, looking back...
- He was drunk.

26:00.228 --> 26:02.367
- He was friggin' drunk.
- Yeah.

26:05.017 --> 26:09.132
I feel like I could be standing
completely naked out here.

26:09.157 --> 26:10.390
You know, all anyone would ever see

26:10.415 --> 26:12.023
is me in that number one jersey.

26:14.884 --> 26:16.078
Well...

26:18.211 --> 26:20.140
...that's not all that I would see.

26:28.537 --> 26:29.797
Please don't do that.

26:35.757 --> 26:37.476
See you, Charlotte.

26:58.396 --> 26:59.929
What up, gridiron, huh?

27:03.279 --> 27:04.875
Has it been 20 years or so?

27:17.456 --> 27:20.124
Another first down for number one.

27:32.571 --> 27:33.835
All right.

27:35.474 --> 27:37.156
Pearson lines up under center.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.687
Two rushing touchdowns

27:39.712 --> 27:42.148
already tonight.
What can this kid not do?

27:42.734 --> 27:44.648
He can't go four hours
without a Vicodin,

27:44.673 --> 27:47.093
that's what he can't do.
But everybody loves him anyway.

27:47.496 --> 27:48.463
"Wow!

27:48.488 --> 27:49.304
Pearson!"

27:50.197 --> 27:51.726
- Blue 42!
- Blue 42!

27:52.234 --> 27:54.292
- Blue 42!
- Blue 42, set, hut-hut.

27:54.326 --> 27:55.375
The ball is hiked.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.351
Pearson drops back. He looks left.

27:58.752 --> 27:59.914
He pump fakes.

28:00.558 --> 28:02.826
He rolls to his right. He tucks
the ball. He's in traffic.

28:02.851 --> 28:04.320
Shucks a defender.

28:04.345 --> 28:05.406
He looks downfield.

28:05.431 --> 28:07.532
He's got a man open. Wide open.

28:07.748 --> 28:09.343
He sees his entire future.

28:09.428 --> 28:10.570
Notre Dame.

28:10.621 --> 28:11.788
Heisman Trophy.

28:11.947 --> 28:13.081
First-round draft pick.

28:13.106 --> 28:15.414
Rookie of the Year. Super Bowl MVP.

28:15.439 --> 28:16.953
He sees his dad in the stands.

28:16.978 --> 28:19.492
As he holds the Super Bowl
trophy, his dad's proud of him...

28:19.517 --> 28:21.406
like, "tears down his
eyes" proud of him.

28:21.431 --> 28:23.000
He says, "That's my son."

28:24.656 --> 28:25.906
"That's my son."

28:28.390 --> 28:30.281
Pearson's about ready
to release. He cocks back.

28:30.351 --> 28:32.484
Boom! He's down, folks.

28:32.617 --> 28:34.165
Ladies and gentlemen, Pearson's down,

28:34.199 --> 28:35.453
and he's not getting up.

28:35.478 --> 28:37.656
His knee is wrecked.
He's not coming back

28:37.681 --> 28:38.789
from this one, folks.

28:38.814 --> 28:41.082
It is over for Kevin Pearson.

28:41.206 --> 28:42.687
- Kate, go call your father.
- Yeah.

28:42.712 --> 28:44.390
Find a phone, page him. Go, go, go.

28:44.415 --> 28:45.710
- Kate, Kate, go.
- Okay, yeah.

28:47.265 --> 28:48.515
Will he get up?

28:49.718 --> 28:50.773
He will.

28:51.383 --> 28:53.664
Ladies and gentlemen, he will.
He'll get up.

28:54.265 --> 28:55.898
Kevin Pearson will walk again,

28:55.923 --> 28:59.126
just in time to bury his beloved father.

28:59.664 --> 29:00.906
That'll keep him down.

29:00.931 --> 29:02.515
For good this time, right?

29:05.712 --> 29:06.781
Nope.

29:09.143 --> 29:11.007
Nope, he's-he's up again.

29:11.032 --> 29:12.796
He's up again, and he's...

29:12.984 --> 29:14.960
He's marrying a terrific girl.

29:15.359 --> 29:17.208
He's off to Hollywood, and it's a...

29:17.242 --> 29:19.210
it's a happy ending for Kevin Pearson.

29:19.244 --> 29:22.000
Oh, whoa. Wait, nope. Hold on, now.

29:22.218 --> 29:23.562
He cheats on the girl.

29:23.968 --> 29:25.716
Yes, that's right. He loses her.

29:25.751 --> 29:27.051
And how's he punished?

29:27.085 --> 29:28.386
Well, he... he gets a sitcom,

29:28.420 --> 29:30.429
and he makes millions,
ladies and gentlemen.

29:30.522 --> 29:32.456
The crowd goes wild.

29:33.429 --> 29:35.187
What will he do
with his lucky second chance?

29:35.212 --> 29:36.640
Ladies and gentlemen, he'll blow it.

29:36.665 --> 29:38.820
That's what he'll do. He blows it all.

29:38.964 --> 29:41.820
Surely the universe has to
punish him this time, right?

29:42.604 --> 29:45.312
Wrong. He gets the girl back.

29:45.703 --> 29:48.765
- Now he's got the girl back,
- and-and it's a movie this time.

29:49.171 --> 29:50.468
And then pop!

29:50.538 --> 29:51.571
Oh.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.359
There it goes, the same knee.

29:53.384 --> 29:54.952
Bam, he's down again.

29:55.882 --> 29:58.070
And he tries so hard to be strong,

29:58.095 --> 30:01.664
and he needs painkillers
to get through it.

30:03.539 --> 30:05.343
And even when he tries to tell people

30:05.368 --> 30:06.539
how pathetic he is, it...

30:06.564 --> 30:07.718
They just...

30:09.487 --> 30:10.601
They don't hear it.

30:11.038 --> 30:12.164
They just cheer.

30:16.984 --> 30:18.062
Hey.

30:19.258 --> 30:21.203
Just the Manny I've been looking for.

30:24.079 --> 30:25.390
You want to party?

30:45.546 --> 30:47.663
Uh, I couldn't believe it

30:47.688 --> 30:50.453
when you walked back
into that reception tonight.

30:51.640 --> 30:53.994
I was sure you'd left your phone
or something.

30:54.734 --> 30:56.640
And then you pointed at me

30:57.257 --> 30:59.398
and said, "Let's get out of here."

30:59.609 --> 31:02.531
Yeah, no, I was there.

31:02.757 --> 31:05.238
It was, like, 20 years of fantasy energy

31:05.273 --> 31:07.240
just going, pow, pow, pow, pow!

31:09.278 --> 31:10.914
All right, cool.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.398
You were nice to me in high school.

31:20.507 --> 31:21.998
I mean, you never knew my name,

31:22.023 --> 31:24.858
but we'd pass in the halls,
and you'd always smile.

31:25.109 --> 31:26.234
Say hi.

31:26.898 --> 31:30.554
And once, at one of Hannah
Brubaker's summer parties,

31:30.812 --> 31:33.992
you saw Mikey Doyle
getting a little handsy with me,

31:34.427 --> 31:36.031
and you pulled him away.

31:38.773 --> 31:39.851
I did that?

31:40.710 --> 31:43.710
I thought to myself, "Now, that

31:43.931 --> 31:45.242
is a good guy."

31:49.023 --> 31:51.023
It's weird, the things you remember.

31:53.203 --> 31:54.459
Anyway, babble, babble.

31:54.484 --> 31:56.923
"Charlotte, stop talking, please."

31:58.351 --> 32:00.007
Whoa. Are you okay?

32:01.164 --> 32:03.732
- Your sweat glands are in overdrive.
- Yeah, know why?

32:03.757 --> 32:05.557
I think it's just, uh...
I think it may be...

32:05.582 --> 32:06.933
If you could crack a
window or something?

32:06.958 --> 32:09.627
- Yeah. I'm on it.
- It's hot in here.

32:16.375 --> 32:19.248
I still don't get
why you wanted to come here.

32:19.273 --> 32:22.415
Your room at The Riverview's
probably super nice.

32:22.450 --> 32:24.251
Actually, will you excuse me
for a second?

32:24.484 --> 32:26.520
Oh, mi baño es su baño.

32:26.554 --> 32:28.218
Yeah.

32:50.955 --> 32:52.889
You okay in there?

32:52.914 --> 32:54.039
Yeah.

33:20.151 --> 33:21.984
You know, I feel like it's
like a blood sugar thing

33:22.009 --> 33:23.643
or something happening
with me, 'cause I,

33:23.678 --> 33:25.211
I haven't eaten since
the airplane, you know?

33:25.246 --> 33:27.981
So, I was, I was wondering, uh,
maybe you could whip us up

33:28.015 --> 33:29.617
- a snack or something.
- Say no more.

33:29.726 --> 33:31.918
One bedspread picnic coming right up.

33:31.953 --> 33:33.554
Ah, that'd be great.

33:48.953 --> 33:50.617
Yodels and cheese okay?

33:50.642 --> 33:52.453
I haven't gone shopping in a while.

33:52.478 --> 33:53.984
Yeah. That's fine.

34:26.491 --> 34:28.158
Kevin?

34:48.340 --> 34:50.973
He's having an MRI done; it's his knee.

35:11.711 --> 35:13.473
Hey, how are you? How's it going?

35:13.591 --> 35:15.847
- Name and birthday?
- Tony Tisdale. 12-10-69.

35:15.882 --> 35:18.622
Doctors' handwriting sure
gets worse every year.

35:18.856 --> 35:19.902
More like Jimmy Fallon up there.

35:19.927 --> 35:21.553
I didn't know Jimmy Fallon worked here.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.177
It's like a late night talk
show or something, right?

35:50.155 --> 35:52.790
My pendant. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35:52.815 --> 35:54.382
No, no, no, no, no, no.

36:05.264 --> 36:06.765
How you feeling, champ?

36:08.240 --> 36:09.794
He came around the end, and...

36:10.927 --> 36:12.837
I didn't even see him.

36:13.114 --> 36:14.192
I know.

36:18.563 --> 36:19.708
All right.

36:20.663 --> 36:21.770
Just say it.

36:23.762 --> 36:25.220
How long do I have the cast on?

36:25.630 --> 36:27.677
- Am I gonna make the playoffs?
- Well...

36:29.064 --> 36:30.450
The thing is, Kev, you...

36:32.373 --> 36:35.020
- Look, if anyone can beat the odds...
- Dad, just say it.

36:40.442 --> 36:41.887
The kind of break you have,

36:42.130 --> 36:44.114
the doctor called it catastrophic.

36:44.139 --> 36:46.653
He thinks you'll be able
to run again, thank God,

36:47.521 --> 36:48.575
but...

36:50.583 --> 36:52.669
the physical demands of the game...

36:52.812 --> 36:56.216
he-he doesn't think
that your knee can...

36:56.691 --> 36:58.231
bear that kind of stress.

36:59.986 --> 37:02.411
Like soon?

37:08.606 --> 37:11.129
I know it's a difficult thing to hear.

37:11.163 --> 37:12.708
He's wrong.

37:13.286 --> 37:15.192
- I can come back from this.
- Kevin.

37:15.762 --> 37:19.004
Yeah, you know what, maybe I
don't go to Notre Dame.

37:19.223 --> 37:21.106
I'll go to Pitt, I don't care.

37:21.131 --> 37:22.932
I wrote Coach Waltering that
nice letter, like you said, Dad.

37:22.957 --> 37:26.270
- It was really nice.
- I know. I believe you.

37:29.177 --> 37:30.482
I'm sorry.

37:30.817 --> 37:32.012
Okay.

37:33.601 --> 37:34.747
I'm sorry.

37:35.869 --> 37:37.403
I've been awful to you.

37:39.802 --> 37:41.521
- And I can do better.
- Kev, hey.

37:42.184 --> 37:43.622
I need you to listen to me, bud.

37:45.715 --> 37:47.193
I would take this on for you.

37:48.536 --> 37:50.869
Okay? I would take on this

37:50.903 --> 37:53.333
and anything else if I could.

37:54.193 --> 37:57.108
And I know that you've had this dream

37:57.143 --> 37:58.810
for a very long time,

37:58.880 --> 38:00.378
and God knows you have

38:00.413 --> 38:03.348
such a beautiful talent,
but I know, in my gut,

38:03.552 --> 38:05.779
it is not the only one that you have.

38:18.318 --> 38:19.583
Hey. I got this

38:20.399 --> 38:24.122
at a very hopeless time in my life.

38:24.919 --> 38:27.724
Someone very special gave it
to me back in Vietnam.

38:33.816 --> 38:36.740
It's a Buddhist symbol of purpose.

38:47.166 --> 38:50.466
I was feeling very lost when I got that.

38:52.139 --> 38:54.865
But I put it on, and I moved forward.

38:55.911 --> 38:57.630
And you know when I was wearing it?

38:59.013 --> 39:00.302
The day you were born.

39:01.529 --> 39:04.169
The moment you came out, my Number One.

39:05.443 --> 39:06.630
And when I held you,

39:07.333 --> 39:08.599
for the first time,

39:08.763 --> 39:10.563
right here in this hospital,

39:10.660 --> 39:12.561
it hit me like a bolt of lightning.

39:13.036 --> 39:15.583
You were my purpose, Kevin.

39:17.325 --> 39:18.857
And I swear to you, son,

39:18.882 --> 39:20.107
I swear to you,

39:20.640 --> 39:22.927
you will find yours.

39:25.628 --> 39:27.146
Okay?

39:33.639 --> 39:34.771
Okay.

39:39.286 --> 39:40.794
Charlotte?

39:40.850 --> 39:42.349
Hey, Charlotte. It's me.

39:43.052 --> 39:44.149
Charlotte, it's Kevin!

39:44.174 --> 39:46.284
I left my dad's necklace.
I need to come in

39:46.318 --> 39:47.833
for a few seconds to look for it, okay?

39:47.976 --> 39:48.997
Charlotte!

39:49.646 --> 39:50.933
- Kevin.
- Charlotte!

39:50.958 --> 39:54.090
Are you out of your mind?
Coming back here, you bastard?

39:54.115 --> 39:56.060
That necklace belonged
to my father, okay?

39:56.095 --> 39:58.935
And I... I just need to come in
for a second and look for it.

39:59.013 --> 40:00.716
- Screw you.
- Just hold on.

40:00.935 --> 40:02.467
That necklace, it's the only thing

40:02.501 --> 40:05.043
I have left in my life from my dad.

40:05.068 --> 40:07.806
It's the only thing I
have, and I know it's up there.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.841
It's a... it's-it's a wh...
it's a wheel pendant

40:09.875 --> 40:11.976
on a little chain.
It's on your bedroom floor.

40:12.011 --> 40:13.478
It's from where you tore
my shirt off. I know...

40:13.512 --> 40:15.247
Would you announce that
to more of my neighbors?

40:15.272 --> 40:16.480
Just go look for it. Please, please.

40:16.505 --> 40:18.044
I don't have your damn necklace.

40:18.069 --> 40:20.138
- Now leave me alone.
- Please, listen to me.

40:20.163 --> 40:21.964
I understand you're upset
that I left, okay?

40:22.169 --> 40:24.365
It had nothing to do with you,
all right?

40:24.390 --> 40:25.771
I'm in pain out here!

40:27.172 --> 40:29.173
Look, I'm in pain here, okay?

40:29.270 --> 40:31.786
Can't you see I'm in pain?

40:35.434 --> 40:37.569
I just need it to stop.

40:41.474 --> 40:43.641
I just need somebody to help me.

41:04.396 --> 41:06.397
I just need somebody to help me.

41:06.802 --> 41:08.132
I just need help, please.

41:08.167 --> 41:10.602
I just need somebody to please help me.

41:16.135 --> 41:17.349
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:19.794 --> 41:21.232
Thanks for taking my call.

41:21.576 --> 41:22.710
Yeah, man.

41:22.830 --> 41:24.598
I didn't know you were already in town.

41:24.804 --> 41:26.575
That beard for a movie?

41:28.724 --> 41:30.321
Randall, I need to tell you something.

41:30.356 --> 41:31.513
It's okay.

41:31.854 --> 41:33.060
I already know.

41:36.439 --> 41:37.865
Kate lost the baby.

41:52.584 --> 41:54.151
Number One has done it!

41:54.186 --> 41:55.653
- Number One has done it!
- Yes!

41:55.687 --> 41:57.122
And now the crowd,

41:57.147 --> 41:59.708
the crowd moves its attention
to the filly!

42:00.668 --> 42:02.469
- Oh, come on, sweetheart.
- Come on, sweetheart.

42:02.494 --> 42:04.495
- Come on, Number Two.
- Come on, Number Two.

42:04.520 --> 42:06.121
Come on...

42:06.146 --> 42:08.867
Just like your brother, baby.
Come on, come on.
