Previously on Doctor Who:

00:06.640 --> 00:08.160
C: Over the past week,
there's been a spate of attacks

00:08.200 --> 00:10.800
on intelligence officers
worldwide,

00:10.840 --> 00:12.120
of every nationality.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.840
We need your help...Doctor.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.160
COMPUTER: Die, die, die.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.200
(SCREAMING)

00:22.920 --> 00:25.400
YAZ: Daniel Barton.
Born in Bromsgrove,

00:25.440 --> 00:27.680
now lives just north
of San Francisco.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.320
- He's the founder of Vor!
- You can't entirely

00:29.360 --> 00:30.400
trust everyone.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.960
YAZ: Only 93% human.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.440
- What's the other 7%?
- We're going to need

00:33.480 --> 00:34.480
your best man on this.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.040
- What do you call him?
- O.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.680
(WINDOW SHATTERS)

00:37.720 --> 00:38.720
O...

00:40.280 --> 00:40.920
(WINDOWS SHATTER)

00:40.960 --> 00:42.640
What have you brought here,
Doctor?

00:44.080 --> 00:45.960
Where are you from?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.440
CREATURE: Far beyond.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.000
(SCREAMS)

00:49.040 --> 00:50.800
Ryan?

00:51.960 --> 00:54.440
If you really think they're
spies, we should be asking

00:54.480 --> 00:55.800
who's the spymaster.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.600
I'm really hard
to get rid of, Mr Barton.

00:59.600 --> 01:00.600
Are you?

01:06.000 --> 01:09.200
Should I say spy...master?

01:09.240 --> 01:11.160
You can't be.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.880
Oh, I can be. I very much am.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.320
Everything that you think
you know...

01:18.360 --> 01:19.760
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.200
...is a lie.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.560
THE DOCTOR: Hi, Doctor.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.560
Oh! Hi.

02:04.600 --> 02:05.840
How are you doing?

02:05.880 --> 02:06.880
Good.

02:06.920 --> 02:09.720
Just talking to myself
to prove I'm still alive.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.720
I was wondering...

02:13.720 --> 02:16.520
...what would you say to
the others if they were here?

02:18.160 --> 02:20.400
"Don't panic."

02:24.720 --> 02:26.400
Yaz! Hold on!

02:26.440 --> 02:29.240
(FRANTIC SHOUTING)

02:31.520 --> 02:33.280
What?

02:33.320 --> 02:34.360
THE DOCTOR: Of course,

02:34.400 --> 02:36.200
I'm usually saying it as much
to myself as I am to them.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.640
Always a good reminder
when you're alone...

02:39.640 --> 02:41.240
...in the unknown...

02:42.520 --> 02:44.960
...all hope lost.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.920
(SHOUTING)

02:49.640 --> 02:50.960
No way.

02:53.760 --> 02:54.960
Won't work in here.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.440
Why not? Could be a clue.
A clue to what?

02:58.920 --> 03:00.000
What...

03:01.000 --> 03:02.040
...was that?

03:03.040 --> 03:06.440
Interesting. Useful. Maybe.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.040
Another! Even better.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.360
What are you?

03:12.400 --> 03:13.600
Pathways?

03:14.960 --> 03:16.440
Signals?

03:16.480 --> 03:17.680
Synapses?

03:17.720 --> 03:18.920
I could be inside something.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.000
Oh, I hope it's not a liver.
I hate being inside livers.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.240
People always get so offended.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.760
"What are you doing
in my liver again?"

03:24.800 --> 03:25.960
WOMAN: Hello?

03:27.320 --> 03:29.560
Hello?

03:29.600 --> 03:31.240
Hello?

03:33.760 --> 03:35.640
"4C seat pocket."

03:38.120 --> 03:39.640
No way.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.280
(GROANS)

03:41.320 --> 03:42.880
Hey! Hey!

03:42.920 --> 03:44.520
I've got a plan.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.760
Can you hear me?

03:49.800 --> 03:51.800
I'm trying to find you...
somehow.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.920
(THE DOCTOR CRIES OUT)

03:59.720 --> 04:01.720
Please be assured
all this will pass.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.800
I shall be recovered
momentarily.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.680
- "Open panel in floor"!
- What does it say next?

04:07.720 --> 04:10.440
"Connect the cable...

04:10.480 --> 04:11.560
"...to your phone."

04:11.600 --> 04:13.120
(STRAINS)

04:15.280 --> 04:16.800
Welcome aboard.

04:16.840 --> 04:20.240
You are kidding!
How's she doing that?!

04:20.280 --> 04:22.120
I realise you have questions.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.880
Where are you?!
We're going to die!

04:24.920 --> 04:27.640
First of all,
you're not going to die.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.760
Second of all,
don't talk back to the screens.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.480
Obviously, I'm a recording
and I can't hear you.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.240
Third, don't panic.
Especially you, Graham.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.840
I'm not panicking!

04:35.880 --> 04:37.000
Yes, you were.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.760
And I did just say don't
talk back to the screens.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.680
Eh?!

04:39.720 --> 04:42.040
Haven't got long. The bomb
in the cockpit knocked out

04:42.080 --> 04:44.480
the signals from the computer
to the engines.

04:44.520 --> 04:47.880
But the computers in this
aircraft aren't in the cockpit,

04:47.920 --> 04:49.680
they're under the cabin floor.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.200
Ryan, the app
should have opened.

04:51.240 --> 04:52.960
What app? Eh?

04:53.000 --> 04:55.480
How was this installed
on me phone?

04:55.520 --> 04:57.640
Use it to communicate
with the engines

04:57.680 --> 04:59.480
via the aircraft wiring.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.480
By the way, you have shut
the cockpit door, haven't you?

05:01.520 --> 05:02.640
That's vital.

05:02.680 --> 05:04.760
Cockpit doors are designed
to be incredibly robust.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.240
I'll do it!

05:06.280 --> 05:07.480
Now pay attention.

05:07.520 --> 05:08.600
Do this fast.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.240
I'm worried you might lose me
if there's a power surge.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.080
Lost her.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.680
Press the cursor up!

05:13.720 --> 05:16.480
We've got to stop this plane
from going down!

05:16.520 --> 05:18.240
Up, up, up!

05:18.280 --> 05:21.600
- Too many ups!
- Level out! Level out!

05:28.480 --> 05:29.800
When you say "recovered",

05:29.840 --> 05:31.480
what do you mean?

05:31.520 --> 05:33.760
The paralysis will fade.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.440
You don't look paralysed.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.920
Not in this...realm
but in my earthly aspect.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.520
Right.

05:42.520 --> 05:43.800
What's your name?

05:43.840 --> 05:45.280
I am Ada.

05:45.320 --> 05:46.840
And what do you think
this realm is, Ada?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.200
I...believe it to be my mind.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.720
Though I have not met
another here before.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.840
Then what do you think I am?

05:55.880 --> 05:59.000
I presume you are
a consequence of my thoughts.

05:59.040 --> 06:01.560
No. I'm the Doctor,
and I'm very real.

06:01.600 --> 06:02.880
But you've been here before?

06:02.920 --> 06:05.560
Many times. When the paralysis
subsides,

06:05.600 --> 06:08.120
I find myself
fully back in my body,

06:08.160 --> 06:10.040
restored in the physical realm.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.080
If you are real, do you have
your own solution

06:12.120 --> 06:13.400
for egress from here?

06:13.440 --> 06:15.480
No exit strategy.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.360
(CRACKLING)

06:17.400 --> 06:19.600
Before I leave, I need to
work out what this place is.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.360
Oh!

06:24.440 --> 06:26.760
Those fragments of light...

06:26.800 --> 06:28.960
...or energy, why are they
surrounding you?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.280
They are always here with me.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.840
They place a word in my mind.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.040
"Kasaavin"?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.640
Ada...step away.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.360
Do not be afraid.

06:52.400 --> 06:54.560
This is my guardian.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.960
This is their realm!

06:57.600 --> 06:59.320
This is where they're from.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.360
But how did you bring us here?

07:03.240 --> 07:04.520
Unless...

07:05.600 --> 07:07.240
You can't be.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.200
But you must be.
What? Gateways?

07:09.240 --> 07:12.000
We go through you
and arrive in your realm?

07:12.040 --> 07:15.840
And I say "realm" - it's not
a planet, not really a void.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.040
A separate dimension?

07:17.080 --> 07:18.400
Are we beyond our...

07:18.440 --> 07:19.520
...my universe?

07:21.400 --> 07:25.160
Little of what you are saying
makes sense to me,

07:25.200 --> 07:27.200
but I'm concerned
you'll be marooned here.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.760
When my guardian
has returned...

07:28.800 --> 07:31.440
- They're not your guardians.
- ...I can offer you my hand.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.400
We may leave this place
together.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.640
I don't think that will work.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.960
How will you know
if you do not try?

07:39.840 --> 07:41.600
Decide, Doctor.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.720
You got us level, Ryan.
Good lad!

07:49.760 --> 07:51.320
I can fly a plane!

07:51.360 --> 07:53.120
Can't ride a bike,
but I can fly a plane.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.640
Hey, look!

07:54.680 --> 07:56.440
Barton must have programmed in
a flight pattern

07:56.480 --> 07:57.760
before he left the cockpit.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.400
Looks like this app's
keying into it.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.800
- How did the Doctor do this?
- No idea.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.280
But now we've got to stay
on a plane without a cockpit...

08:05.280 --> 08:07.320
...till it decides
where to land.

08:10.880 --> 08:14.200
You should've seen me!
I was great!

08:14.240 --> 08:15.960
She did not have a clue.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.360
This better work.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.320
Final calibrations,

08:20.360 --> 08:22.200
and then we'll be ready.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.560
All our efforts will
come together

08:25.600 --> 08:27.600
in a moment of beauty.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.120
We'll all have what we want.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.960
So you know, I don't appreciate

08:34.000 --> 08:37.800
last-minute changes of plan
as I'm about to take off.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.520
A little chaos
is a wonderful thing.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.720
Allowed me to swat those flies.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.840
(PHONE BEEPS)

08:50.240 --> 08:52.640
I've just been notified.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.080
My plane's about to land
at its programmed destination.

08:55.120 --> 08:58.320
- They can't have survived.
- You told me

08:58.360 --> 09:01.360
everything was foolproof.
What's gone wrong?

09:01.400 --> 09:03.200
Watch your tone...

09:03.240 --> 09:05.240
...Mr Barton.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.320
I'm not your employee.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.640
(ALARM BLARES)

09:15.160 --> 09:16.280
(HEAD THUDS REPEATEDLY)

09:19.240 --> 09:21.200
How has she got there?

09:21.240 --> 09:23.240
What's happened?

09:25.840 --> 09:29.720
Nothing I can't deal with.
I'll drop you at your plane.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.880
You sort out her friends,
I'll deal with the Doctor.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.760
Ah.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.520
I'm getting...

09:44.560 --> 09:46.160
...19th century?

09:47.720 --> 09:49.120
Early...

09:50.120 --> 09:52.760
...with a touch of mid.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.600
Top notes...

09:54.640 --> 09:56.160
...London.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.680
Steam?

09:57.720 --> 09:59.160
Why am I getting steam?

09:59.200 --> 10:02.480
Nations shall cower in fear

10:02.520 --> 10:06.200
as my steam gun fires
1,000 bearings per minute.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.480
- (AUDIENCE GASPS)
- See the mouse survive

10:08.520 --> 10:11.640
inside our revolutionary
diving bell!

10:11.680 --> 10:14.480
- (AUDIENCE GASPS)
- Touch the magneto.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.960
- Powerful shocks.
- (AUDIENCE GASPS)

10:17.000 --> 10:21.160
The perfect modern defence,
a grenade for the home.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.080
Intruders repelled with force.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.560
(AUDIENCE GASPS)

10:24.600 --> 10:26.120
It worked!

10:26.160 --> 10:27.240
Miss Gordon,

10:27.280 --> 10:28.960
- are you recovered?
- I am.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.600
- Thank you.
- Me too.

10:30.640 --> 10:31.640
Thanks for asking.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.000
Madam, this gallery

10:33.040 --> 10:35.920
is full of
the extraordinary, but...

10:35.960 --> 10:38.200
your apparition just now
was...

10:39.200 --> 10:40.960
...impossible.
How did you do it?

10:42.840 --> 10:43.840
Er...

10:46.880 --> 10:49.680
I am bound never to
reveal my secrets.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.080
Go about your day,

10:51.120 --> 10:53.840
knowing that you may tell
people you were

10:53.880 --> 10:55.520
privileged to witness

10:55.560 --> 10:58.840
the Marvellous Apparating Man!

10:58.880 --> 11:01.640
Lady. Apparating Lady!

11:01.680 --> 11:04.080
- Every time!
- (APPLAUSE)

11:06.040 --> 11:09.520
The year, right now,
would be what?

11:09.560 --> 11:13.920
The year, madam,
remains 1834.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.480
Yes.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.440
Marooned in the 19th century.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.920
Hold on in there, fam.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.360
And there was no-one on board?

11:28.400 --> 11:32.560
No, sir. It appears the craft
landed itself via automation.

11:35.040 --> 11:38.880
Sir, we have had
this conversation before.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.440
If you're going to be testing
these sort of systems,

11:41.480 --> 11:43.840
we really need to be
kept fully in the loop.

11:43.880 --> 11:46.200
I'm going to have to do
some tricky smoothing-over

11:46.240 --> 11:47.880
with the Civil Aviation
Authority.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.200
YAZ: How did he get here
so quick?

11:52.240 --> 11:55.400
I dunno. Where is "here",
anyway?

11:55.440 --> 11:57.040
Britain.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.680
We're home.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.400
Almost.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.160
- Essex.
- Essex!

12:02.200 --> 12:04.680
That is my manor!
We are golden!

12:05.960 --> 12:07.640
What do we do, though?

12:08.680 --> 12:10.920
Figure out what Barton and O
are planning.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.160
That's what the Doctor
would do....

12:12.200 --> 12:14.800
- Yeah.
- ...if she was here.

12:14.840 --> 12:17.440
No, she'll be all right, Yaz.
Just got to believe.

12:17.480 --> 12:19.080
You didn't see that place.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.120
Eh?

12:20.160 --> 12:21.880
Still got access
to Barton's diary.

12:21.920 --> 12:24.600
He's giving a keynote speech
in London tomorrow night.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.480
That is where
we have got to get to.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.600
Yeah, without him
knowing we're still alive.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.000
So let's get moving.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.560
(KEYPAD BEEPS)

12:37.120 --> 12:39.080
I need tracking intel
on three people.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.280
As soon as you can!

12:42.720 --> 12:44.560
These are their names.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.440
ADA: Now we are safe,
Doctor, will you reveal

12:47.480 --> 12:49.680
a little more concerning how
you came to be...

12:49.720 --> 12:50.720
- Agh!
- ...in that place

12:50.760 --> 12:52.640
and, indeed, who you are?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.800
I'm a traveller
in space and time.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.960
I was in the middle of dealing
with a planet-threatening

12:58.000 --> 13:00.960
conspiracy two centuries
from now when I was attacked

13:01.000 --> 13:03.960
by an old enemy and exiled
to the place where I found you.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.160
- Oh!
- I'm not a fool, Doctor.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.880
And I'm not treating you
as one.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.320
This conspiracy involves

13:10.360 --> 13:12.960
those creatures you think
are your guardians.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.480
They're in alliance with
a renegade from my home planet

13:15.520 --> 13:17.920
and a 21st-century
tech inventor.

13:17.960 --> 13:21.240
186 years from now,
they're assassinating spies,

13:21.280 --> 13:23.320
and I am stuck here
without my TARDIS,

13:23.360 --> 13:25.440
and I need to find
my way back before...

13:25.480 --> 13:28.160
Ladies and gentlemen!

13:28.200 --> 13:31.840
See the incredible
shrinking device!

13:31.880 --> 13:33.800
Want to be smaller, ladies?

13:33.840 --> 13:35.360
You can!

13:35.400 --> 13:38.560
- (SCREAMING)
- Who's next? You, sir.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.960
Go, Ada. You too.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.360
Go!

13:42.400 --> 13:44.160
Ah, the happy couple!

13:45.680 --> 13:47.800
I said go!

13:47.840 --> 13:49.520
Do not move!

13:51.560 --> 13:53.160
Hands on heads.

13:54.840 --> 13:55.880
Hands on heads!

13:55.920 --> 13:57.160
(SCREAMING)

13:59.280 --> 14:00.320
Let them go....

14:01.640 --> 14:03.280
...and you can have me.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.000
I've got you anyway.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.200
Did you just move?

14:16.240 --> 14:18.400
- Did you move?
- No!

14:22.520 --> 14:24.320
(LAUGHS)

14:24.360 --> 14:26.800
Oh, my mistake.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.320
Sorry.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.800
Sorry.

14:34.360 --> 14:35.840
When I kill them, Doctor,

14:35.880 --> 14:37.120
it gives me a little buzz.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.880
Right here.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.920
In the hearts. It's like...

14:42.960 --> 14:44.960
How would I describe it?
It's like...

14:46.120 --> 14:47.960
It's like knowing
I'm in the right place,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.440
doing what I was made for.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.240
What do you want?

14:55.240 --> 14:56.680
Kneel.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.240
Kneel.

15:02.280 --> 15:04.400
Or they all die.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.000
Call me by my name.

15:25.520 --> 15:26.800
Master.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.400
Beg your pardon?

15:31.600 --> 15:32.920
Master!

15:32.960 --> 15:34.120
Can't hear you, love.

15:35.480 --> 15:36.760
Master.

15:44.080 --> 15:47.560
When I arrange for your death,
I expect you to stay dead.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.680
How did you escape?
How did you end up here?

15:58.320 --> 15:59.760
You don't know!

16:02.440 --> 16:06.240
You're not in control
of these creatures.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.920
I bet you don't even know
what they are.

16:11.080 --> 16:12.800
They're called the Kasaavin.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.760
And we have interests
in common.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.320
You, Barton...

16:17.360 --> 16:21.280
...and a race you barely know?
That's one uneasy alliance.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.320
Trust each other, do you?

16:25.360 --> 16:26.640
Oh, completely.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.960
By the way,
I bring news from home.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.720
Down, Doctor!

16:36.840 --> 16:38.840
This is not designed for use

16:38.880 --> 16:40.080
- by a young lady!
- Nothing is.

16:40.120 --> 16:43.280
And yet I find myself
more than capable.

16:44.360 --> 16:45.440
All of you, out!

16:45.480 --> 16:47.720
Ada, I really do not approve.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.280
Run all you like, Doctor.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.840
You won't get far
without a TARDIS!

16:51.880 --> 16:54.160
Don't have a TARDIS.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.960
Do have an Ada.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.400
It's hard not to stand out
in this gear.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.840
- (PHONE RINGS)
- We've been on a night out.

17:04.880 --> 17:07.160
We're just coming home, that's
all. Nothing weird about that.

17:07.200 --> 17:10.160
- (PHONES RING)
- BARTON: Hello, friends.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.520
Or should I say
"plane thieves"?

17:12.560 --> 17:15.040
What, did you think I wouldn't
be able to track you?

17:15.080 --> 17:18.120
We have your numbers, e-mails,
GPS. I even know how many

17:18.160 --> 17:21.280
more stamps you need for
a free coffee. So close, Ryan.

17:21.320 --> 17:23.520
Or should I say "Logan"?

17:23.560 --> 17:25.120
Look up.

17:25.160 --> 17:26.920
Your passports
have been revoked,

17:26.960 --> 17:28.360
your bank cards are frozen.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.480
We have a record of
everyone you know -

17:30.520 --> 17:32.320
friends, family, colleagues,

17:32.360 --> 17:34.800
everyone you ever followed
on social media.

17:34.840 --> 17:35.960
Of course, we have

17:36.000 --> 17:38.080
cameras everywhere, and now
you're wanted for hijacking.

17:38.120 --> 17:41.200
Go on, go off-grid.
See how long you last.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.320
Hey, smash your phones now.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.160
Aw! Yasmin Khan
is phoning her mum!

17:48.200 --> 17:49.720
- He don't half go on.
- MUM: Yaz?

17:49.760 --> 17:52.800
Hello. It's me. Listen, don't
listen to anything you hear.

17:54.080 --> 17:55.280
- Ryan!
- You're not hearing.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.600
We have to go dark.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.320
Run.

18:00.560 --> 18:02.840
MR BABBAGE: Surely we must
alert the authorities.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.520
THE DOCTOR: The authorities
won't be any help.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.880
ADA: Besides, what would
we tell them, Mr Babbage?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.560
I have no concept, Ada.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.760
I cannot explain any of
what I have seen today.

18:11.800 --> 18:14.480
Babbage? Charles Babbage?

18:14.520 --> 18:15.880
Yes.

18:15.920 --> 18:16.960
So this must be...

18:17.000 --> 18:18.680
- My Difference Engine.
- ...your Difference Engine!

18:18.720 --> 18:21.720
Oh. You...you know of it?

18:21.760 --> 18:24.560
- Er, just in passing.
- As yet unfinished.

18:24.600 --> 18:29.520
It will count and perform
quadratic equations.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.000
If you're Charles Babbage,

18:31.040 --> 18:33.120
then you're not just
any old Ada.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.520
You're Ada Lovelace!

18:34.560 --> 18:37.040
Daughter of Lord Byron
and Annabella Milbanke,

18:37.080 --> 18:38.880
one of the great minds.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.560
I am Ada Gordon, madam.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.920
1834. Of course you are.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.280
Well, maybe one day, who knows,
you might meet a nice earl.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.400
This changes everything!

18:48.440 --> 18:50.200
This isn't an accident.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.160
Ada Lovelace
in Babbage's house?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.240
You're clues.

18:54.280 --> 18:56.200
- You're important.
- I'm...

18:56.240 --> 18:58.320
...delighted to hear it, madam.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.120
Yes, it's not good news.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.280
What's that?

19:01.320 --> 19:03.840
This is the Silver Lady...

19:04.840 --> 19:07.160
...a revolutionary
piece of engineering.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.400
But, like all great ladies,

19:09.440 --> 19:13.440
she is as much for decoration
as for purpose.

19:15.680 --> 19:17.920
How did you come by this?
It was a gift,

19:17.960 --> 19:19.160
delivered by a young man

19:19.200 --> 19:21.800
who said it was
a token of appreciation....

19:21.840 --> 19:23.120
...from his master.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.320
Was it?

19:28.080 --> 19:29.400
What does it do?

19:29.440 --> 19:31.000
It...moves...

19:31.040 --> 19:33.880
...and, on occasion, projects.

19:33.920 --> 19:34.960
On occasion

19:35.000 --> 19:36.600
projects something like this?

19:39.880 --> 19:42.400
M-Mr Babbage, you have seen
the same form.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.960
Madam, those are
my private notes.

19:46.080 --> 19:49.080
The Master and the Kasaavin,
what are they doing?

19:49.120 --> 19:51.880
Er... Do you understand her,
Miss Gordon?

19:51.920 --> 19:54.560
Not in the least, Mr Babbage.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.840
Ada, when was
your first paralysis?

19:56.880 --> 19:58.680
I was 13 years old.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.800
That is when I was first
transported to the place

20:00.840 --> 20:03.920
where we met
and I first saw an apparition.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.360
And over the years,
the paralysis recurs

20:06.400 --> 20:07.560
with the same effect?

20:07.600 --> 20:11.640
Yes! No doctor has ever been
able to diagnose the cause.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.440
Well, this Doctor
may be able to.

20:13.480 --> 20:16.120
An apparition...
from this machine.

20:16.160 --> 20:17.360
- Correct.
- So,

20:17.400 --> 20:19.600
they take you, Ada,
multiple times...

20:20.560 --> 20:22.160
...from here and...

20:22.200 --> 20:23.800
...they study you
in their dimension,

20:23.840 --> 20:26.800
which means they can't be
in this dimension for long.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.440
But maybe they gain an ally,

20:29.480 --> 20:32.040
a mastermind who builds them

20:32.080 --> 20:36.680
a machine which
stabilises them in this world

20:36.720 --> 20:40.560
long enough for them to send
spies and to spread their work

20:40.600 --> 20:43.200
and start a plan.
Cos I've seen the map!

20:43.240 --> 20:45.680
In his hut. Multiple Earths.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.680
Except not.
Not multiple Earths.

20:48.920 --> 20:51.360
Multiple time periods.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.280
These creatures aren't just
alien spies on Earth,

20:55.320 --> 20:57.240
they're spies through time...

20:58.520 --> 21:00.480
...through history...

21:00.520 --> 21:02.080
- ...starting with you.
- (SONIC WHIRS)

21:02.120 --> 21:03.640
What are you doing?

21:03.680 --> 21:05.800
The man from the Adelaide
Gallery will be coming for me.

21:05.840 --> 21:06.920
I need to get back

21:06.960 --> 21:10.160
to where I came from, find
my friends and figure this out.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.480
And I've only got
one way out of here,

21:13.520 --> 21:15.320
the same way I came in.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.880
If I use my sonic on the Silver
Lady, I might be able to force

21:17.920 --> 21:20.680
this creature to throw me
back to the 21st century.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.640
- I hope.
- If this is your plan,

21:22.680 --> 21:24.080
it is fraught with risk.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.120
Where there's risk,
there's hope.

21:26.840 --> 21:28.280
Deep breath.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.320
Ada, no!

21:38.960 --> 21:42.520
No-one living here yet, no
CCTV, no neighbourhood watch.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.600
The one on the end. Go on!

21:52.400 --> 21:54.440
What if the Doctor
doesn't come back?

21:55.440 --> 21:57.560
What if we never see her again?

21:57.600 --> 21:59.520
We keep going....

21:59.560 --> 22:01.280
...stop Barton...

22:01.320 --> 22:04.200
...get rid of those creatures,
whatever they are.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.120
Ryan's right.

22:06.160 --> 22:09.520
We carry on doing what the Doc
would want us to do.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.760
I'm sorry, did you just say,
"Ryan's right"?

22:11.800 --> 22:14.560
Yes, I did!
Enjoy the moment, son.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.120
You won't hear it often.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.360
And that old guy...

22:22.080 --> 22:23.120
...if the Doctor knew him,

22:23.160 --> 22:25.280
how come she couldn't
recognise him?

22:27.800 --> 22:29.080
In the outback...

22:30.080 --> 22:32.840
...he said that he knew the Doc
when she was a man,

22:32.880 --> 22:34.720
and that first night we met...

22:35.800 --> 22:39.080
...she told me and Grace
that she'd been through, erm...

22:39.120 --> 22:40.800
...something called...

22:42.760 --> 22:44.840
...regeneration, like
her whole body had changed.

22:44.880 --> 22:47.320
We've spent all this time
with her

22:47.360 --> 22:48.880
and we don't even know
where she's from.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.200
Yeah, not for want of asking,
though. Eh? I mean!

22:52.240 --> 22:54.080
And we will ask....

22:54.120 --> 22:55.320
...when we see her again...

22:56.560 --> 22:58.120
...which we will...

22:58.160 --> 23:01.360
...cos she is safe somewhere,
of course. Right?

23:02.880 --> 23:04.560
- Right.
- RYAN: Right.

You know what she'd ask now?

23:11.840 --> 23:13.960
"What do we have
at our disposal?"

23:15.840 --> 23:17.240
Well...

23:17.280 --> 23:20.520
...I've, er...got to admit...

23:20.560 --> 23:23.520
...I did keep a couple of
those spy gadgety things.

23:23.560 --> 23:25.440
Me too!

Hey, are you

23:26.800 --> 23:29.320
- wearing the laser shoes?
- I might be.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.280
Why didn't you use them
on the plane?!

23:31.320 --> 23:33.480
What, in a confined space
like that?

23:33.520 --> 23:34.800
You're having a laugh, in't ya?

23:34.840 --> 23:36.200
That wouldn't have been
very smart, would it?

23:36.240 --> 23:38.400
And besides which, I forgot

23:38.440 --> 23:40.520
- to read the instructions.
- Graham!

23:40.560 --> 23:42.440
Well, we was in a rush!
What could I do?

23:43.480 --> 23:44.960
Rocket cufflinks.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.760
To be fair, I didn't read the
instructions on those either.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.080
- BOTH: "Doughnut"?
- Yeah, the pair of you.

- The shoe, Graham!
- What?

or something!

You've got to aim better.

wearing such strange clothes?

in the Adelaide Gallery.

home dimension, where we met,

31:20.400 --> 31:22.640
and then to the 21st century.

instead, which is,

to 20th, it's progress.

and now he wants me dead,

How have you managed that?

36:57.440 --> 36:59.760
You're not exactly
their Aryan archetype.

36:59.800 --> 37:03.560
Tiny Teutonic
psychic perception filter.

37:03.600 --> 37:05.640
Learned it at school.

37:05.680 --> 37:08.280
Lets people see
what they want to see.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.360
I'm assuming it was you
who hijacked the MI6 car.

37:10.400 --> 37:11.400
That was fun.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.040
And assassinated C.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.840
Mandraffian laser rifle.

37:14.880 --> 37:16.280
One shot.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.160
I've still got an eye for it.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.760
Why were the Kasaavin

37:22.800 --> 37:24.360
assassinating spies?

37:27.040 --> 37:29.360
Earth's intelligence services

37:29.400 --> 37:31.640
started to realise
their presence.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.200
So, what, you brought
the Kasaavin to Earth?

37:33.240 --> 37:36.280
They were already here.
(CHUCKLES)

37:36.320 --> 37:38.680
I just persuaded them
we had interests in common.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.040
The Kasaavin are embedded
across the whole

37:41.080 --> 37:45.160
of this universe,
spies from another dimension.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.720
As I said to Mr Barton...

37:48.560 --> 37:50.040
...think of them as Russia....

37:51.480 --> 37:52.600
...but bigger.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.880
Sleeper agents everywhere,

37:54.920 --> 37:58.840
waiting to be activated,
amassing information

37:58.880 --> 38:01.160
in case they need to attack.

38:01.200 --> 38:05.680
And, I mean, you know me.
I can't help myself.

38:05.720 --> 38:07.720
I have to stick my oar in.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.560
What have you done?

38:13.480 --> 38:15.960
Suggested a better plan.

38:19.840 --> 38:21.520
(TYRES SCREECH)

38:23.440 --> 38:24.960

38:26.880 --> 38:27.960

38:29.280 --> 38:30.720
No.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.040
What's she even doing here?

38:36.120 --> 38:37.680
Where's Barton?

38:37.720 --> 38:39.560
This is where his guys
were supposed to lead us,

38:39.600 --> 38:40.720
and he's not here.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.280
(BEEP)

38:42.320 --> 38:44.840
Well done
overpowering my people.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.680
But did you really think
they wouldn't tell me?

38:47.720 --> 38:49.920
I have a significant
announcement to make,

38:49.960 --> 38:52.560
and you, my friends,
are two steps behind.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.520
- As usual.
- YAZ: We know all about you.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.840
We know some of your DNA
isn't human.

38:58.240 --> 38:59.520
So what are you, part alien?

38:59.560 --> 39:02.400
You really don't understand
who I am.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.800
I build things.

39:03.840 --> 39:04.920
I test them.

39:04.960 --> 39:08.600
So I let them test
a tiny part of me.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.600
And now it's time
for the global roll-out.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.240
I'm proof of concept.

39:13.280 --> 39:16.000
What concept?
What did they try?

39:16.040 --> 39:18.680
Look after my mum.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.360
He killed his own mum.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.640
And left her here.

39:33.480 --> 39:36.360
That machine was
in Barton's office.

39:41.280 --> 39:43.040
What are you doing?

39:43.080 --> 39:45.640
Communicating a message
back to London,

39:45.680 --> 39:47.720
just as the Doctor asked.

39:47.760 --> 39:51.240
- Why are we trusting her?
- I have seen

39:51.280 --> 39:53.280
extraordinary things with her.

39:54.520 --> 39:58.920
She's wise and unafraid,
and I believe in her.

39:59.960 --> 40:03.480
W-What is this...contraption
she's left us with?

40:04.680 --> 40:08.200
I don't know. I've never seen
anything like that before.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.760
So...

40:10.800 --> 40:12.920
...are you ready
to brave the night?

40:14.680 --> 40:17.920
(DISTANT GUNFIRE
AND EXPLOSIONS)

40:31.680 --> 40:33.360
How does that fit here?

40:34.600 --> 40:37.440
She did say,
"Look for something anomalous."

40:39.720 --> 40:41.960

- Oh! Must change the ringtone.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.560
Sent it to voicemail.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.160
Probably just asking
if I've had an accident

41:01.200 --> 41:02.520
in the last five years.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.400
They hate it when you give them
a list, though, don't they?

41:04.440 --> 41:07.120
Why didn't you die when
the Kasaavin attacked you?

41:07.160 --> 41:10.360
Me and Yaz,
both time travellers,

41:10.400 --> 41:12.560
fizzing with artron energy,

41:12.600 --> 41:14.760
and my DNA not matching
the rest of humanity,

41:14.800 --> 41:15.880
we confused them.

41:15.920 --> 41:17.240
And I don't think
they're as stable

41:17.280 --> 41:19.720
in this dimension
as they'd like to be.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.680
What deal have you made
with them?

41:21.720 --> 41:24.520
I showed them and Barton
what was possible.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.600
They helped me
lay a trap for you,

41:26.640 --> 41:28.680
and I raised their ambitions.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.360
Of course, ultimately...

41:33.400 --> 41:36.720
...the Kasaavin are just
the mechanism.

41:36.760 --> 41:39.840
They...They don't have
my vision. You know?

41:39.880 --> 41:41.440
And what vision is that?

41:41.480 --> 41:43.240
Maximum carnage.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.520
I don't understand.

41:44.560 --> 41:45.920
No, no, I know you don't.

41:46.920 --> 41:47.920
But you will.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.200
And of course,
the best thing is...

41:52.240 --> 41:54.440
...everyone loses except me.

41:54.480 --> 41:57.160
Barton and those creatures
do the dirty work,

41:57.200 --> 41:58.880
and once they're done,
I get rid of them,

41:58.920 --> 42:01.360
having destroyed your precious
human race in the process.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.920
Win-win-win.

42:02.960 --> 42:05.480
When does all this stop
for you?

42:06.480 --> 42:08.080
The games?

42:08.120 --> 42:09.400
The betrayals?

42:09.440 --> 42:10.720
The killing?

42:10.760 --> 42:12.840
Why would it stop?

42:12.880 --> 42:15.480
I mean, how else
would I get your attention?

42:16.880 --> 42:19.840
When did you last go home?

42:19.880 --> 42:21.240
What do you mean?

42:23.560 --> 42:25.600
I took a trip home.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.320
To Gallifrey.

42:28.360 --> 42:31.800
Hiding in its little

what I found.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.760
"Pulverised"?

42:36.800 --> 42:38.800
"Burned"?

42:38.840 --> 42:40.520
"Nuked"?

42:40.560 --> 42:43.120
All of the above.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.360
Someone destroyed it.

42:48.440 --> 42:50.280
Our home...

42:51.800 --> 42:53.440
...razed to the ground.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.560
Everyone killed.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.640
Everything burned.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.680
You're lying.

43:04.720 --> 43:07.560
You should really take a look.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.240
Oh, wait, you won't be able to.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.160

I'd let you know before I...

43:13.880 --> 43:16.320

Oh. That's me...

43:18.720 --> 43:20.920
...and one of Blighty's
bravest radio operators.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.240
Very good at sending messages,

43:22.280 --> 43:25.840
particularly fake ones
designed to be intercepted.

43:25.880 --> 43:27.240
Now, finish
what you were saying!

43:27.280 --> 43:29.040
What have you done?!

43:29.080 --> 43:30.880
Sent a message to the Brits...

43:32.280 --> 43:35.320
...telling them how valuable
you've been...

43:35.360 --> 43:37.320
...as a double agent....

43:38.720 --> 43:42.160
...sending Nazi information
to the British.

43:45.720 --> 43:47.200
Very easy to jam.

...didn't even change
the appearance.

44:33.520 --> 44:36.640
OK, you two,
my best secret agents,

44:36.680 --> 44:38.520
time to go lock-picking.

44:43.360 --> 44:44.720
This is not a house.

It's a machine

I'm the sanest person alive.

OK, that was an overstatement.

Ah, my brain's fizzing. Good.

on every person on that map,

what Barton does.

48:42.880 --> 48:45.680
Luckily,
there's an app for that.

48:52.880 --> 48:54.160
Anyone feel like this is

48:54.200 --> 48:55.920
something we should be
worried about?

49:08.320 --> 49:09.640
Mum?

49:09.680 --> 49:11.520
I can't move!

49:13.440 --> 49:17.280
A handful of us will remain
sentient in order to supervise,

49:17.320 --> 49:18.640
maybe even rebuild.

49:18.680 --> 49:20.840
But for the rest of you...

49:21.920 --> 49:24.320
...welcome to
the end of your lives.

49:25.600 --> 49:27.120
Use your shoe on the machine.

49:28.720 --> 49:29.880
It doesn't make any difference.

49:29.920 --> 49:31.360
Cufflinks!

49:33.560 --> 49:34.560
Move away.

49:35.880 --> 49:37.160
Now!

49:39.600 --> 49:40.600
I've just had

49:40.640 --> 49:45.080
the most infuriating 77 years
of my life.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.320
Have you any idea
how hard it is

49:46.360 --> 49:48.640
to live through
the 20th century?

49:50.200 --> 49:52.800
The places I've escaped from...

49:52.840 --> 49:56.520
(INHALES DEEPLY) Still...
just in time to...

49:56.560 --> 49:58.040
...watch you all pay.

49:58.080 --> 49:59.360
What's the machine?

50:02.880 --> 50:05.600
Conversion and transmission.

50:05.640 --> 50:06.960
We're transmitting

50:07.000 --> 50:09.880
Kasaavin energy
around the world all at once

50:09.920 --> 50:13.720
into every device,
hitting every human being

50:13.760 --> 50:17.560
and erasing all their DNA
simultaneously.

50:18.400 --> 50:20.600
- Jaz!
- I can't let go of it.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.760
First her. Then you.

50:27.920 --> 50:29.200
Then you.

50:33.720 --> 50:35.000
Don't do this.

50:37.240 --> 50:38.920
(MURMURING)

50:38.960 --> 50:40.640
Extraction team in.

50:40.680 --> 50:41.760
Immediately!

50:50.560 --> 50:53.040
Sorry. I think
that might have been me.

50:53.080 --> 50:55.760
And I'll admit, it was close.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.880
What was that?

51:00.920 --> 51:02.800
What do I keep telling you?

51:02.840 --> 51:04.880
Conspiracy!

51:06.160 --> 51:08.080
- No.
- Two can play

51:08.120 --> 51:10.160
at embedding things in history.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.640
I knew the Silver Lady
was important

51:12.680 --> 51:14.360
and that you built it
for a reason.

51:14.400 --> 51:15.880
But I couldn't work out why.

51:17.440 --> 51:21.000
So I traced its movements
through history.

51:21.040 --> 51:23.080
And when I saw that Barton
now owned it,

51:23.120 --> 51:24.880
we stopped by his office.

51:24.920 --> 51:26.400
Middle of last year,

51:26.440 --> 51:28.160
using your TARDIS, I built

51:28.200 --> 51:31.200
a fail-safe into that machine,
planted a virus.

51:31.240 --> 51:32.760
If it ever detected

51:32.800 --> 51:35.640
the massing of a Kasaavin army
within its systems -

51:35.680 --> 51:37.480
total shutdown.

51:40.640 --> 51:44.160
You're going to have to explain
yourself to them, Doctor.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.080
Am I?

51:47.640 --> 51:48.640
Listen, you lot,

51:48.680 --> 51:49.960
I've rigged the Silver Lady

51:50.000 --> 51:52.560
to exile you back to
your own dimension.

51:52.600 --> 51:54.400
This planet's off-limits.

51:54.440 --> 51:56.800
Oh, and you know that deal
he made with you?

51:56.840 --> 51:59.120
O: Barton and these creatures
do the dirty work,

51:59.160 --> 52:00.760
and once they're done,
I get rid of them,

52:00.800 --> 52:03.520
having destroyed your precious
human race in the process.

52:03.560 --> 52:05.240
Win-win-win.

52:05.280 --> 52:07.560
Oh...

52:07.600 --> 52:09.120
That's your name.

52:09.160 --> 52:10.680
Don't wear it out.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.920
That's the trouble
with modern technology.

52:12.960 --> 52:15.120
You never know
when you're being spied upon.

52:15.160 --> 52:17.200
(KASAAVIN MURMUR THREATENINGLY)

52:17.240 --> 52:20.160
Don't... Don't listen to her.

52:31.640 --> 52:32.640
No.

52:33.960 --> 52:35.160
Doctor...

52:37.400 --> 52:42.120
Doctor!

52:43.560 --> 52:45.320
What?

52:45.360 --> 52:47.840
You have a lot of
explaining to do.

52:47.880 --> 52:50.000
- Like what?
- Like...

52:50.040 --> 52:51.320
Who are they?

52:51.360 --> 52:53.520
And are we being replaced?

52:53.560 --> 52:54.760
No!

52:54.800 --> 52:57.200
This is Ada, this is Noor.

52:57.240 --> 52:58.520
1834,

52:58.560 --> 53:02.440
1943. They helped me out. I'm
dropping them back in a sec.

53:02.480 --> 53:04.640
How did you manage
to save our lives on the plane?

53:04.680 --> 53:06.360
The plane!

53:06.400 --> 53:08.480
Oh! I forgot!

53:08.520 --> 53:09.920
Come on!

53:11.880 --> 53:14.040
You have shut the cockpit
doors, haven't you?

53:14.080 --> 53:15.120
That's vital.

53:15.160 --> 53:17.280
Cockpit doors are designed
to be incredibly robust.

53:21.800 --> 53:23.240
I love a laminator.

53:24.560 --> 53:26.960
Stick these in Barton's
plane as it's being built

53:27.000 --> 53:28.440
then reclaim my own TARDIS.

53:29.480 --> 53:31.600
This is where I leave you.

53:32.640 --> 53:34.360
Answer me one question.

53:34.400 --> 53:37.400
The fascists - do they win?

53:37.440 --> 53:38.640
Never.

53:39.720 --> 53:41.480
Not while there's people
like you.

53:43.400 --> 53:44.720
It's all right.

53:44.760 --> 53:47.280
I'm just removing me
from your mind.

53:54.800 --> 53:56.640
Bonne chance.

54:03.120 --> 54:05.600
(VWORPING)

54:10.440 --> 54:13.080
Doctor? Does this
have to be the end?

54:13.120 --> 54:19.040
All the things I've learned,
the advances, the machines!

54:19.080 --> 54:21.440
I would dearly love
to see more.

54:21.480 --> 54:23.840
I'm afraid I need to do
something about that.

54:23.880 --> 54:25.760
- What do you mean?
- I'm ever so sorry, Ada.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.600
D-Doctor, what are you doing?

54:27.640 --> 54:29.600
Wiping the things you shouldn't
have knowledge of.

54:29.640 --> 54:30.840
Including me.

54:30.880 --> 54:32.240
But I want that knowledge.

54:32.280 --> 54:34.240
Don't take it away.
Please don't take it a...

54:36.280 --> 54:37.840
Oh, Ada.

54:37.880 --> 54:40.000
You don't need a preview.

54:40.040 --> 54:41.840
You'll figure it out
before anyone.

54:41.880 --> 54:45.240
The first to see the potential
in things like that,

54:45.280 --> 54:47.120
to work out what could be...

54:48.120 --> 54:50.000
...what they can really do.

54:50.040 --> 54:52.160
Computers start with you.

54:53.960 --> 54:55.760
Sweet dreams, Ada Lovelace.

55:05.480 --> 55:06.880
(VWORPING)

55:16.000 --> 55:18.160
O: When did you last go home?

55:18.200 --> 55:20.400
You should really take a look.

56:15.120 --> 56:17.960
(JINGLING)

56:22.440 --> 56:23.920
O: Geo-activated.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.680
If you're seeing this...

56:32.720 --> 56:35.080
...you've been to Gallifrey.

56:37.960 --> 56:40.520
When I said someone did that...

56:41.520 --> 56:43.520
...obviously I meant...

56:45.080 --> 56:46.440
...I did.

56:49.160 --> 56:51.960
I had to make them pay
for what I discovered.

56:55.520 --> 56:57.320
They lied to us...

56:59.720 --> 57:02.280
...the founding fathers
of Gallifrey.

57:04.720 --> 57:07.000
Everything we were told
was a lie.

57:09.120 --> 57:11.120
We are not who we think,

57:11.160 --> 57:12.760
you or I.

57:12.800 --> 57:15.680
The whole existence
of our species...

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
...built on the lie
of the timeless child.

57:22.600 --> 57:25.600
REMNANTS:
Child...child...child...

57:26.800 --> 57:28.240
Do you see it?

57:29.640 --> 57:33.240
It's buried deep
in all our memories...

57:34.240 --> 57:35.960
...in our identity.

57:37.280 --> 57:39.760
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

57:41.720 --> 57:43.240
I'd tell you more...

57:44.440 --> 57:45.440
...but...

57:51.040 --> 57:53.480
...but why would I make it
easy for you?

57:55.480 --> 57:57.480
It wasn't for me.

58:03.200 --> 58:04.560
(GROANS)

58:13.520 --> 58:15.480
YAZ: You OK?
You're really quiet.

58:15.520 --> 58:17.200
RYAN: Yeah. You have been
for days now.

58:17.240 --> 58:19.440
They're right. Five planets,
you've barely said a word.

58:19.480 --> 58:21.240
I'm fine!

58:21.280 --> 58:23.040
Why don't you ever
share anything with us?

58:23.080 --> 58:24.680
I share stuff!

58:24.720 --> 58:26.840
Not about yourself, though.

58:26.880 --> 58:29.000
RYAN: Yeah, you know
everything about us.

58:29.040 --> 58:30.400
YAZ: And we know
nothing about you.

58:30.440 --> 58:31.640
GRAHAM: Mm.

58:32.960 --> 58:34.720
Fine.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.280
What do you want to know?

58:43.320 --> 58:46.160
Who are you, Doc?
I mean, really.

58:50.200 --> 58:52.600
I was born on a planet
called Gallifrey

58:52.640 --> 58:54.880
in the constellation
of Kasterborous.

58:56.440 --> 58:58.800
I'm a Time Lord.

58:58.840 --> 59:00.680
I can regenerate my body.

59:01.920 --> 59:04.280
I stole this TARDIS
and I ran away.

59:04.320 --> 59:06.280
I've been travelling
ever since.

59:08.280 --> 59:10.720
The Master was one of
my oldest friends.

59:12.280 --> 59:14.080
We went very different ways.

59:16.640 --> 59:18.040
Questions?

59:25.560 --> 59:26.640
Loads.

59:27.680 --> 59:30.240
Can we visit...your home?

59:33.280 --> 59:35.400
Another time.

1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:24.920
WOMAN: Welcome to
Tranquillity Spa.

1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:26.760
Why would you need to defend
a holiday spa

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:27.880
with an ionic membrane?

1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:29.520
I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about.

1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:30.960
We're not safe out here.
