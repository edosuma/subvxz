part ONE

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
To Beatrice -

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
To Beatrice - 
My love flew like a butterfly,

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
To Beatrice - 
My love flew like a butterfly, 
until death swooped down like a bat.

01:30.950 --> 01:32.867
It's a catastrophe! It's unprecedented!

01:32.950 --> 01:34.908
It's off-book! It's unfortunate!

01:34.992 --> 01:37.367
The Baudelaires are lost
and unsupervised!

01:37.450 --> 01:38.992
Do you know what that means?

01:39.075 --> 01:42.075
- Without supervision?
- Good God, man, you're right!

01:42.158 --> 01:44.742
We must act now.
We must act without delay.

01:44.825 --> 01:47.075
We...

01:47.158 --> 01:49.325
need...

01:50.367 --> 01:51.658
We need...

01:59.325 --> 02:00.658
Oh!

02:01.700 --> 02:03.075
Oh, my.

02:04.408 --> 02:06.200
Oh, my. This is excellent chowder.

02:07.325 --> 02:09.491
CROCK 'O' CHOWDER

02:10.949 --> 02:13.200
Oh, God...

02:23.283 --> 02:25.700
I hope Mr. Poe isn't too worried about us.

02:28.033 --> 02:29.158
Good point.

02:34.492 --> 02:36.033
<i>If you like watching stories</i>

02:36.117 --> 02:38.117
<i>in which children enjoy pleasant rides
in truck beds,</i>

02:38.200 --> 02:40.117
<i>on their way to colorful destinations...</i>

02:40.200 --> 02:41.242
What the gum?

02:41.325 --> 02:42.533
<i>where they finally solve</i>

02:42.617 --> 02:44.992
<i>the curious mysteries
plaguing their lives...</i>

02:45.075 --> 02:46.700
Get a job, hitchhikers!

02:48.867 --> 02:50.908
that story is streaming elsewhere.

02:51.825 --> 02:53.783
- What now?
- We walk.

02:54.065 --> 02:55.009
Walk?!

02:55.033 --> 02:56.825
It's okay, Sunny. I got you.

03:05.867 --> 03:08.283
We're almost out of the woods.

03:11.242 --> 03:13.283
"Out of the woods" is an expression

03:13.367 --> 03:17.783
referring to the fact
that woods are dangerous places to be.

03:18.783 --> 03:20.283
In <i>Hansel and Gretel...</i>

03:21.325 --> 03:25.533
two siblings enter the woods
and are menaced by an elderly cannibal.

03:26.908 --> 03:29.367
In <i>Little Red Riding Hood,</i>
a wolf enters the woods

03:29.450 --> 03:32.117
and is menaced by a rude little girl.

03:33.367 --> 03:34.825
And in <i>Walden,</i>

03:34.908 --> 03:37.575
a poet enters the woods
and is menaced by revelations

03:37.658 --> 03:42.242
that we should abandon civilization
and live by a pond.

03:44.450 --> 03:47.992
It is for that reason that
"out of the woods" has come to mean

03:48.075 --> 03:51.742
"a return to safety, away from menace
and disturbing revelations."

03:51.825 --> 03:53.700
I am sorry to say while Violet was right

03:53.783 --> 03:56.700
in that the Baudelaires
were almost out of the forest...

03:59.242 --> 04:01.283
<i>they were far from out of the woods.</i>

04:09.450 --> 04:11.408
It looks like there was a fire here.

04:11.492 --> 04:13.825
- Everything's gone.
- Not everything.

04:13.908 --> 04:15.658
"Lucky Smells Lumbermill."

04:16.492 --> 04:18.825
Maybe this is where all the clues lead us.

04:18.908 --> 04:22.950
The secret safe and the strange
photographs at Aunt Josephine's.

04:23.033 --> 04:26.158
The secret message and
the strange statue lady at Uncle Monty's.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.410
Count Olaf. He's just strange.

04:28.658 --> 04:31.825
The only thing standing between us
and all our parents' secrets...

04:32.658 --> 04:34.325
is an enormous wooden wall.

04:35.908 --> 04:39.283
What if we don't like what we find?
Knowing can be a terrible thing.

04:39.367 --> 04:41.242
But not knowing, isn't that worse?

04:48.575 --> 04:51.617
I bet I could invent a catapult
to get us over.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.408
I read about walls.

04:53.492 --> 04:55.617
The Wall of Jericho,
the Great Wall of China.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.742
All I need is a lever, a counterweight
and a very large spoon.

04:58.825 --> 05:01.033
Pink Floyd's <i>The Wall.</i>

05:01.117 --> 05:02.992
Although Mother wouldn't
let me watch that one.

05:03.075 --> 05:04.700
Sunny?

05:11.742 --> 05:14.325
- Does this make us trespassers?
- We're children.

05:14.408 --> 05:15.867
Those aren't mutually exclusive.

05:15.950 --> 05:19.242
If we get caught, we'll just say we were
on a school trip. Come on.

05:27.617 --> 05:29.325
What exactly are we looking for?

05:29.408 --> 05:31.908
It's like Father said about fine art.

05:31.992 --> 05:33.283
We'll know it when we see it.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.033
I think we're in the right place.

05:37.742 --> 05:39.367
Or the very, very wrong place.

05:41.075 --> 05:43.742
- It could just be a coincidence.
- It could be Count Olaf.

05:46.325 --> 05:47.408
Maybe we should leave.

05:49.242 --> 05:52.075
Forgive me.
I thought you might be trespassers.

05:52.158 --> 05:53.450
But now I see you're just children.

05:53.533 --> 05:56.450
- They're not mutually...
- We're on a school trip.

05:56.533 --> 05:59.950
Right, because we're schoolchildren.

06:00.033 --> 06:02.658
Well, this Lumbermill is hardly
a safe place for children.

06:02.742 --> 06:05.533
And I should know, I run it.
I'm Charles.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.992
Do you recognize any of these people?

06:12.742 --> 06:14.950
I think you better come
and see my partner.

06:16.283 --> 06:18.408
Do you know what happened
to the town over there?

06:18.992 --> 06:21.992
Well, it's a sad story.
Paltryville used to be booming.

06:22.075 --> 06:25.033
We had a world food market,
two hot yoga studios,

06:25.117 --> 06:27.033
and there was even talk of a water park.

06:27.117 --> 06:29.117
The name Paltryville was a misnomer.

06:29.783 --> 06:33.325
And then one day, the whole town
burned down in a terrible fire.

06:33.408 --> 06:37.367
Luckily, the Lumbermill survived...
and the eye-shaped building,

06:37.450 --> 06:40.117
which actually belongs to...
Oh, look, here we are.

06:51.492 --> 06:54.617
Uh, children, I'd like you to meet...

06:54.700 --> 06:56.283
Call me Sir.

06:56.367 --> 07:00.658
Everybody does 'cause I tell 'em to.
I'm the boss.

07:00.742 --> 07:03.325
They have to do what I say,
even my partner here.

07:04.700 --> 07:06.908
Doesn't "partner" mean "equal"?

07:08.200 --> 07:10.283
Well, in fact,
"partners" can mean several things.

07:10.367 --> 07:14.450
It could mean "two people who own
a Lumbermill together, or a cupcakery."

07:14.533 --> 07:17.283
Now, with the advent of
more progressive cultural mores,

07:17.367 --> 07:21.117
not to mention certain High Court rulings,
it could also mean...

07:21.200 --> 07:23.367
I do all the work. He irons my clothes.

07:23.450 --> 07:25.617
I also cook your omelets.

07:25.700 --> 07:28.783
The definitions are not
mutually exclusive.

07:28.867 --> 07:32.450
I found them wandering unsupervised,
poor dears.

07:32.533 --> 07:34.992
Well, you know what we do
with trespassers, don't you, Charles?

07:35.075 --> 07:36.575
But they're only children.

07:36.658 --> 07:40.242
I thought we could take them in.
Give them a loving, normative home.

07:40.325 --> 07:41.325
Nonsense.

07:41.408 --> 07:43.450
I believe you treat children
like grown-ups.

07:43.533 --> 07:47.033
Put 'em to work in the mill.
It'll teach them responsibility.

07:47.117 --> 07:49.075
It'll teach them the value of hard work.

07:49.158 --> 07:52.242
And it'll teach 'em how to make
flat wooden boards out of trees.

07:52.325 --> 07:54.200
- But, Sir...
- Don't argue with me. We're partners.

07:54.283 --> 07:57.700
If we work in the mill,
do we get to stay here?

07:57.783 --> 07:58.617
"Get to"?

07:59.006 --> 07:59.768
Stay here?

08:00.492 --> 08:01.867
This one gets it.

08:01.950 --> 08:05.117
In this economy,
children are lucky to have a job at all.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.200
- What's your name, young lady?
- Violet... Baudelaire.

08:10.700 --> 08:13.200
- A Baudelaire.
- Wait, do you... do you know that name?

08:13.283 --> 08:15.117
Of course I do.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.825
Every man, woman and child in Paltryville
knows the name Baudelaire.

08:19.492 --> 08:21.658
Why? Did you know our parents?

08:21.742 --> 08:23.408
Who are the other people
in this photograph?

08:23.594 --> 08:25.594
What's with that eye building?

08:25.742 --> 08:27.408
I don't understand what "ack" means,

08:27.492 --> 08:30.658
but if you want to know about
your parents, they...

08:30.742 --> 08:32.658
Sir.

08:32.741 --> 08:34.575
Every time we're about to get
some answers.

08:34.658 --> 08:36.033
Seriously?

08:36.116 --> 08:37.283
It's these cigars.

08:37.366 --> 08:41.158
I hate the things, but I can't quit
smoking 'em. I'm the boss.

08:41.241 --> 08:42.616
Now, where was I?

08:42.700 --> 08:48.450
Oh, yeah. There's a reason
this town will never forget your parents.

08:48.533 --> 08:50.825
They're the ones that burned it down.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.075
Our parents did what?

08:55.158 --> 08:57.908
I'm an important man.
Don't make me repeat myself.

08:57.992 --> 08:59.950
They burned down the town!

09:01.283 --> 09:05.117
They're, um...
not anywhere nearby, are they?

09:05.200 --> 09:07.908
They died... in a fire.

09:07.992 --> 09:08.992
Good.

09:09.742 --> 09:11.367
What goes around comes around.

09:11.992 --> 09:14.367
It's a terrible thing, startin' a fire.

09:19.117 --> 09:22.450
Why are you still standing there?
You got work to do in the morning.

09:26.450 --> 09:30.408
Tell me, truck driver,
you're sure there were three of them?

09:30.492 --> 09:31.533
I'm sure I'm sure.

09:31.617 --> 09:33.908
A tall girl, a boy with glasses

09:33.992 --> 09:36.450
and a little baby
who I think bit a hole in my spare tire.

09:36.533 --> 09:39.450
And did they seem like orphans
with an enormous fortune?

09:39.533 --> 09:40.700
I don't know about that.

09:40.783 --> 09:42.367
They snuck into my truck
and I threw 'em out

09:42.450 --> 09:44.408
maybe 2.5 miles outside of Paltryville,

09:44.492 --> 09:47.575
- like I told you.
- Paltryville.

09:47.658 --> 09:51.658
- You've been there before?
- Mmm. It's been years.

09:51.742 --> 09:54.700
- Tell me, truck driver...
- I said my name was Evander.

09:54.783 --> 09:58.575
Did you ever know a woman, truck driver,
who took your heart

09:58.658 --> 10:00.867
and rattled it like a baby in a cage?

10:00.950 --> 10:04.158
Who joined you for years
on a sequence of heists and schemes

10:04.242 --> 10:07.117
until the two of you were forced apart
by circumstance,

10:07.200 --> 10:08.742
and also because you ran off

10:08.825 --> 10:10.575
in the middle of the night
with a bunch of her valuables?

10:10.658 --> 10:13.200
Uh, no, I've been in the lumber industry
all my life.

10:13.283 --> 10:14.158
Hmm.

10:14.867 --> 10:17.200
You can let me off here,
in the middle of town.

10:19.617 --> 10:20.908
For you.

10:26.075 --> 10:27.367
Seriously?

10:38.575 --> 10:40.408
That night
in the Lumbermill workers' dorm,

10:40.492 --> 10:42.367
the Baudelaires pondered
what they'd heard,

10:42.450 --> 10:45.783
<i>and the weight of it felt like
it had aged them a hundred years.</i>

10:47.492 --> 10:49.200
<i>Though, of course, it hadn't.</i>

10:49.867 --> 10:52.158
Did you hear about the new recruits?

10:52.242 --> 10:55.992
- They're Baudelaires.
- I hear their folks were arsonists.

10:56.075 --> 10:58.700
I hear they checked out library books
and never returned them.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.950
I hear they drank blood
from the skulls of chupacabras.

11:02.033 --> 11:04.533
You mean they drank from baby skulls
like chupacabras.

11:04.617 --> 11:05.658
I know what I heard.

11:05.742 --> 11:09.783
That's ridiculous.
Did any of you actually meet our parents?

11:09.867 --> 11:12.783
- I think Jimmy did.
- Norma Rae is here longer.

11:12.867 --> 11:14.700
Don't look at me. Look at Cesar.

11:14.783 --> 11:17.533
Do you know anything
about what happened to this town?

11:17.617 --> 11:20.408
- We're not allowed to talk about that.
- It's too terrible.

11:20.492 --> 11:21.908
Also, we don't know.

11:21.992 --> 11:23.992
Then you shouldn't be spreading rumors.

11:24.075 --> 11:26.283
I never believed those rumors anyway.

11:26.367 --> 11:29.492
So... where are your parents now?

11:29.575 --> 11:30.950
We're orphans.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.408
Lucky you!

11:32.492 --> 11:35.575
The unsupervised life.
No rules, no curfews.

11:35.658 --> 11:37.617
<i>Lights out. Two seconds.</i>

11:37.700 --> 11:38.992
But it's only six o'clock.

11:39.075 --> 11:41.825
Oh, boy, more time for dreaming.

11:41.908 --> 11:45.700
I'm Phil,
and I am excited to work with you kids.

11:46.283 --> 11:50.575
Thank you. I'm Violet.
These are my siblings, Klaus and Sunny.

11:50.658 --> 11:53.367
Listen, I... I know things seem dark.

11:53.992 --> 11:55.242
But you have to look on the bright side.

11:55.325 --> 11:58.325
So your parents burned down towns.
You don't have to be like your parents.

11:58.408 --> 12:01.408
My parents were Olympic athletes
and look at me.

12:02.575 --> 12:04.575
I work in a Lumbermill.

12:04.658 --> 12:05.950
<i>From Phil's words,</i>

12:06.033 --> 12:09.033
<i>the Baudelaires could tell that
their new coworker was an optimist...</i>

12:09.117 --> 12:11.283
Who wants a welcome packet?

12:12.242 --> 12:14.283
<i>a word meaning
"person who thinks hopeful thoughts</i>

12:14.367 --> 12:16.533
<i>about even the bleakest situation."</i>

12:16.617 --> 12:20.617
For example, if an optimist were to have
his right arm bitten off by an alligator,

12:20.700 --> 12:23.575
he might say, "Oh, boy,
half-price manicures for life."

12:23.658 --> 12:26.242
Whereas the rest of us would say,
"Ah, my arm!"

12:26.325 --> 12:28.742
"Optimist" is not to be confused
with "optometrist,"

12:28.825 --> 12:32.325
a word meaning "healthcare professional
who performs eye exams."

12:38.533 --> 12:40.450
Though both can be dangerous.

12:42.325 --> 12:46.033
Still, while they pored over the dense
contents of their welcome packets

12:46.117 --> 12:49.367
and poked at dense beef casserole
with their welcome spoons,

12:49.450 --> 12:52.492
the Baudelaires faced
their first night in Paltryville

12:52.575 --> 12:55.408
with some attempted optimism of their own.

12:59.075 --> 13:01.533
Look. The mill has a library.

13:02.033 --> 13:05.533
Maybe you can research what happened here
and clear our parents' names.

13:05.617 --> 13:08.575
Look. The mill has machines.

13:08.658 --> 13:12.408
Maybe you could invent a way of making
wooden planks out of trees faster.

13:12.956 --> 13:14.956
Look. It's that eye building.

13:16.033 --> 13:17.283
What does it say it is?

13:17.808 --> 13:18.726
I can't read.

13:18.950 --> 13:20.825
Optimist's office.

13:20.908 --> 13:24.742
I meant optometrist's office.
Father always said he didn't trust either.

13:24.825 --> 13:28.075
But what does an optometrist's office
have to do with Count Olaf?

13:28.867 --> 13:30.075
Maybe Phil was right.

13:30.742 --> 13:32.200
We should look on the bright side.

13:32.950 --> 13:34.783
This mill may be miserable,

13:34.867 --> 13:37.700
but since we got here,
we haven't seen Count Olaf once.

13:38.950 --> 13:41.575
What if that eye really was a coincidence?

13:41.658 --> 13:44.742
What if we've finally found a place
where Count Olaf won't find us?

13:48.283 --> 13:51.825
Wish I could say she was right,
but Violet was asking the wrong questions.

13:51.908 --> 13:54.700
The question
she should have been asking was...

13:55.283 --> 13:58.033
where does Count Olaf's
ex-girlfriend work?

14:27.158 --> 14:30.325
- Who is it?
- I'm looking for a Dr. Orwell.

14:34.075 --> 14:37.367
Um... who's calling, please?

14:37.450 --> 14:40.075
I'm just an old friend.

14:40.158 --> 14:43.658
Um, Dr. Orwell's not here right now.

14:43.742 --> 14:46.242
And she doesn't have any old friends.

14:46.325 --> 14:50.742
Ah, but this is an old friend
who severely regrets his actions.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.908
- Really?
- Yes.

14:54.992 --> 14:59.658
He's brokenhearted, and he wants very much
to forget the whole thing.

15:00.242 --> 15:02.617
So he isn't just knocking
on Dr. Orwell's door

15:02.700 --> 15:05.908
because he needs something for himself?

15:09.075 --> 15:14.283
No. He's just in town,
looking for Dr. Georgina Orwell,

15:14.367 --> 15:16.908
in the hopes
of somehow making things right.

15:16.992 --> 15:20.408
Because life is so short,
it is so rare to meet,

15:20.492 --> 15:23.992
to find someone
who shares one's brilliance, one's charm,

15:24.700 --> 15:28.450
one's dubious moral code
in a world gone gloriously wrong.

15:28.950 --> 15:33.325
Such people must stick together
like comrades, like partners, like...

15:35.492 --> 15:36.617
You've changed your hair.

15:36.700 --> 15:38.242
Olaf.

15:38.325 --> 15:39.492
Georgina.

15:40.075 --> 15:42.867
I swore I would never
let you darken my door again.

15:42.950 --> 15:46.700
I took a solemn oath that my office
would be closed to you forever,

15:46.783 --> 15:48.700
even during regular business hours.

15:49.367 --> 15:53.533
You're not still mad about...
whatever I did.

15:53.617 --> 15:55.033
You left me to drown.

15:55.117 --> 15:56.492
Water under the bridge.

15:56.575 --> 15:58.950
- That's where you left me.
- Are you sure that was you?

15:59.783 --> 16:03.533
Sorry, I have my own life now,
with my own evil scheme,

16:03.617 --> 16:04.992
which I've put a lot of work into

16:05.075 --> 16:07.242
and I don't need you ruining,
like that bar mitzvah.

16:07.325 --> 16:10.742
What if I told you we had another chance
to destroy the Baudelaires?

16:14.533 --> 16:15.617
The Baudelaires?

16:15.700 --> 16:18.783
Well, their miserable children this time.

16:19.367 --> 16:24.325
Fate has brought us together, my pet.
Fate and fortune.

16:24.408 --> 16:26.742
How big a fortune are we talking?

16:29.908 --> 16:30.992
Is Sunny sleep?

16:35.283 --> 16:38.658
She's dreaming about biting something.
Why?

16:38.742 --> 16:40.742
What Sir said about our parents.

16:41.367 --> 16:43.908
- You don't think it could be true.
- Of course not.

16:44.492 --> 16:45.783
Then you agree what we have to do.

16:45.867 --> 16:48.617
- Of course. Clear their names.
- Get out of here. Wait, what?

16:48.700 --> 16:51.950
If we clear their names,
maybe we can finally get some answers.

16:52.033 --> 16:55.700
- Maybe they wouldn't want us here.
- Then they shouldn't have left us alone.

16:57.033 --> 16:58.450
You know that's not what they did.

16:59.908 --> 17:03.033
I'm sorry. I know it's not their fault.

17:03.950 --> 17:06.700
And I know
you're just trying to be cautious.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.657
I guess we're not seeing eye to eye.

17:13.492 --> 17:15.325
I wish they were here.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.282
- Our parents.
- I know.

17:18.992 --> 17:20.867
I don't like this place either.

17:20.950 --> 17:24.492
But staying is the best way to find out
what our parents were hiding.

17:24.992 --> 17:27.825
The best way to find out
would be to ask them.

17:33.825 --> 17:35.492
But we never can.

17:41.783 --> 17:43.992
- We can't keep hiding like this.
- You're right.

17:44.075 --> 17:47.117
- Our enemies are too close already.
- I mean from the children.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.450
We can't keep hiding
this part of our lives.

17:49.533 --> 17:51.117
When we get back,
we're gonna tell them everything.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.992
What we do. Why we do it.

17:53.075 --> 17:56.075
We need to make it back first.
What do you think?

17:56.158 --> 17:57.825
We're not out of the woods.

18:07.700 --> 18:10.075
<i>Morning is an important time of day,</i>

18:10.158 --> 18:12.200
<i>because how you begin your morning
can often tell you</i>

18:12.283 --> 18:14.325
<i>what kind of day you're going to have.</i>

18:15.075 --> 18:18.700
<i>If you wake up in a mansion
to a butler serving you blueberry pancakes</i>

18:18.783 --> 18:20.950
<i>and fresh-squeezed orange juice...</i>

18:22.033 --> 18:23.950
<i>your day will probably be wonderful.</i>

18:24.450 --> 18:25.950
If you wake up in a Lumbermill

18:26.033 --> 18:28.492
to the sound of metal pots
banging together...

18:28.575 --> 18:30.742
<i>Get up, lumber workers!</i>

18:30.825 --> 18:32.992
<i>This is your new foreman,</i>

18:33.075 --> 18:36.367
and you've got a new shipment of logs
to turn into flat wooden boards.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.408
What's that horrible noise?

18:38.992 --> 18:41.325
It sounds like
someone banging metal pots together.

18:42.783 --> 18:44.658
I believe everyone has a good side.

18:44.742 --> 18:47.575
But I have to admit,
our last foreman was a lot nicer.

18:47.658 --> 18:50.117
- What happened to your last foreman?
- Must've quit in middle of the night.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.658
It happens a lot around here.

18:51.742 --> 18:54.908
<i>Hurry up. It's log day.</i>

18:55.575 --> 18:56.992
I hate log days.

19:33.617 --> 19:36.617
Now grab a debarker
and start debarking.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.117
You too, lumber midgets.

19:50.617 --> 19:52.283
Oh, I love log day.

20:26.617 --> 20:28.492
<i>Lunch break, lumber slowpokes.</i>

20:30.575 --> 20:33.242
I hate log days.

20:33.325 --> 20:34.367
Told ya!

20:34.450 --> 20:35.742
We finally get a break.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.280
Even I'm tired of biting things.

20:37.700 --> 20:39.742
Lunch break. Five minutes.

20:39.825 --> 20:43.075
Oh, boy, five whole minutes.

20:44.158 --> 20:47.867
It's gum. This is gum.

20:47.950 --> 20:51.075
Gum isn't lunch.
It's not even a snack.

20:51.158 --> 20:53.575
It's not very filling, but it's all
they'll let you eat until dinner.

20:53.658 --> 20:55.867
Can we use our wages
to buy some sandwiches?

20:55.950 --> 20:58.533
Lady, we're not paid in wages.

20:58.617 --> 20:59.783
We're paid in coupons.

20:59.867 --> 21:03.033
I got one for 20% off a shampoo
at Ed's Haircut Palace.

21:03.117 --> 21:05.075
I got a free refill of iced tea.

21:05.158 --> 21:07.700
I got "Buy two banjos, get one free."

21:07.783 --> 21:11.200
'Course I can't buy any banjos
'cause I don't have any money.

21:11.283 --> 21:12.450
Just coupons.

21:12.533 --> 21:13.575
That can't be legal.

21:13.658 --> 21:15.950
It's not like we have a constitution.

21:16.033 --> 21:17.950
If this place is so miserable,
why don't you leave?

21:18.742 --> 21:22.533
Lucky Smells is our life.
Lucky Smells is our home.

21:28.533 --> 21:32.075
We need to find those answers
and get out of here, fast.

21:41.533 --> 21:45.200
According to the map,
the mill library should be just behind...

21:47.033 --> 21:48.658
behind this door.

21:54.867 --> 21:56.742
Trying to get out of log day, are you?

21:57.242 --> 21:59.825
We wanted to visit the library
on our lunch break, Sir.

21:59.908 --> 22:01.033
Oh, what a lovely idea.

22:01.117 --> 22:02.742
I told you a library
would be good for morale.

22:02.825 --> 22:03.867
Nonsense.

22:03.950 --> 22:06.575
Lunch breaks are for chewing gum,
not sneaking off to libraries.

22:06.658 --> 22:09.117
- That's why you only need five minutes.
- But, Sir...

22:09.200 --> 22:11.658
You're not gonna cause trouble
for this mill, are you?

22:11.742 --> 22:13.700
Trouble? I'm your partner.

22:13.783 --> 22:16.408
- I'm speaking to the Baudelaires.
- Right.

22:17.117 --> 22:18.783
I took a chance
on treating you like grown-ups.

22:18.867 --> 22:21.367
Don't make me regret it.
Now, get back to work!

22:24.450 --> 22:27.533
You'll have to excuse Sir.
He recently cut down on the smoking.

22:27.617 --> 22:30.450
Do you know he feeds the workers gum
and pays them in coupons?

22:30.533 --> 22:33.075
Yes, well, I've tried to discuss that.

22:33.158 --> 22:36.075
If you guys are partners,
you should be able to stand up to him.

22:36.158 --> 22:37.533
It's complicated.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.742
I know Sir can be prickly,

22:39.825 --> 22:43.367
but you have to understand,
he had a very terrible childhood.

22:43.450 --> 22:44.950
I understand.

22:46.325 --> 22:48.450
I'm having
a very terrible childhood right now.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.867
Okay.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.492
- You're thinking something.
- It's the new foreman.

23:08.575 --> 23:10.367
Phil said he just showed up last night.

23:10.450 --> 23:13.367
What if he's Count Olaf
and being a foreman's his new disguise?

23:13.450 --> 23:14.908
He is cruel like Count Olaf,

23:14.992 --> 23:18.367
but Count Olaf runs a horrible
theater company, not a Lumbermill.

23:18.450 --> 23:20.533
But isn't it suspicious
how we never see his face?

23:20.617 --> 23:22.658
And we only ever hear his voice
over the loudspeaker.

23:22.742 --> 23:24.033
The mill is noisy.

23:24.117 --> 23:27.242
Besides, it's probably the only way
anyone could ever hear him.

23:27.325 --> 23:29.242
I know what you're trying to do.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.575
Keep us safe.

23:30.658 --> 23:32.033
Find a reason to leave.

23:32.117 --> 23:35.742
And we will, I promise, as soon as
we clear our parents' names.

23:37.075 --> 23:38.783
I... I need a new debarker.

24:02.117 --> 24:06.783
- What are you doing, midget?
- I... need a new debarker.

24:06.867 --> 24:09.283
Spoiled brat wants a new debarker.

24:09.367 --> 24:12.408
Old rusty one
isn't good enough for him, eh?

24:12.492 --> 24:14.992
They're over there, rich boy.

24:16.033 --> 24:17.283
Wait...

24:21.742 --> 24:23.658
- Whoopsie!
- Klaus!

24:26.783 --> 24:28.992
Your glasses, they're...

24:29.075 --> 24:30.617
- Twisted.
- Cracked.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.283
- Hopelessly broken.

24:33.283 --> 24:34.617
They look A-okay to me.

24:34.700 --> 24:37.367
The foreman kicked him
and stepped on his glasses.

24:37.450 --> 24:39.617
How could I kick him
when I'm up in this booth?

24:39.700 --> 24:41.325
It was probably karma.

24:42.450 --> 24:44.867
- Can you see?
- A little.

24:45.450 --> 24:47.950
He'll live. Get back to work.

24:48.033 --> 24:51.783
He can't work if he can't see.
He needs an optometrist.

24:51.867 --> 24:55.158
Good for you, we've got a great one
right here in what's left of our town.

24:55.242 --> 24:56.325
The building shaped like an eye?

24:56.408 --> 24:59.075
Oh, yeah,
Dr. Orwell treats all the workers.

24:59.158 --> 25:01.367
You probably saw the coupon
in your welcome packet.

25:01.450 --> 25:02.617
I better get you there.

25:03.283 --> 25:05.783
I'll be fine.
Maybe I can find some answers.

25:05.867 --> 25:07.492
Maybe I can find some answers, too.

25:12.700 --> 25:16.200
Your cruelty is as sweet as this coffee
I'm dumping this sugar into.

25:17.117 --> 25:19.033
Oh, Georgina, I missed this.

25:19.658 --> 25:23.325
You, me, an evil scheme, a little death.

25:23.408 --> 25:24.950
<i>La petite Mort.</i>

25:25.033 --> 25:26.450
You know I love it when you speak Spanish.

25:26.533 --> 25:30.325
Let's run away to Europe and find
a charming little country to take over.

25:30.408 --> 25:31.658
What about the children?

25:32.283 --> 25:33.742
Shouldn't we live together first?

25:33.825 --> 25:35.700
The Baudelaire children.

25:35.783 --> 25:37.200
Hmm.

25:37.283 --> 25:38.492
Oh!

25:38.575 --> 25:39.908
Let me.

25:39.992 --> 25:41.867
Dr. Orwell's office.

25:41.950 --> 25:43.783
<i>Hey, boss.</i>
<i>He's on his way.</i>

25:43.867 --> 25:44.950
He...

25:46.033 --> 25:47.200
He's on his way.

25:57.242 --> 25:58.450
In the book <i>The Great Gatsby,</i>

25:58.533 --> 26:01.700
there's a famous sign
shaped like a pair of eyeglasses.

26:01.783 --> 26:03.492
Does it represent an optometrist?

26:03.575 --> 26:08.367
It represents the eyes of God staring down
and judging society as a moral wasteland.

26:08.450 --> 26:10.367
Oh, that sounds like a fun book.

26:12.200 --> 26:16.950
Listen... I know going to the doctor
can be scary.

26:17.033 --> 26:18.783
But doctors are your friends.

26:19.367 --> 26:20.492
Come on.

26:21.617 --> 26:22.783
Phil was wrong, of course.

26:22.867 --> 26:26.242
As anyone who's been to a doctor knows,
doctors are not necessarily your friends,

26:26.325 --> 26:28.742
any more than butchers, mail deliverers,

26:28.825 --> 26:31.033
or refrigerator repair people
are your friends.

26:31.117 --> 26:35.700
I myself once fought with a most
unfriendly refrigerator repair person.

26:38.867 --> 26:41.325
I wonder what ever happened to him.

26:51.242 --> 26:55.492
Ordinarily, we'd never impose,
but we're in urgent need of a ride.

27:03.450 --> 27:05.533
- Partners?
- Always, darling.

27:13.033 --> 27:16.200
We better hurry,
before the foreman realizes we're gone.

27:18.450 --> 27:20.283
Or before Sir gets back.

27:27.492 --> 27:30.367
They're all <i>The History</i>
<i>of Lucky Smells Lumbermill.</i>

27:30.450 --> 27:33.200
Who would want so many copies
of the same book?

27:36.908 --> 27:38.408
Of course.

27:41.783 --> 27:44.033
Whenever Klaus reads
a long, difficult book,

27:44.117 --> 27:47.450
the first thing he does
is reads the table of contents.

27:47.533 --> 27:50.492
"Chapter 12. The Paltryville Fire."

27:56.283 --> 27:59.242
"The Baudelaires were
unequivocally responsible..."

27:59.325 --> 28:00.742
The rest is crossed out.

28:06.783 --> 28:08.117
This one's crossed out, too.

28:22.950 --> 28:25.450
This one's not crossed out.

28:52.117 --> 28:55.450
Sir, your goat cheese
and beef jerky omelet is ready.

28:59.575 --> 29:00.783
We have to get out of here.

29:01.319 --> 29:02.093
Found something.

29:02.617 --> 29:03.742
A dictionary.

29:03.825 --> 29:06.700
But why are you showing this to me?
You can't read.

29:07.700 --> 29:10.492
The quote that Sunny found scrawled
on the inside cover has been said

29:10.575 --> 29:13.200
by many of my associates over the years.
It goes...

29:15.242 --> 29:17.242
"In every library,
there is a single book

29:17.325 --> 29:20.783
that can answer the question
that burns like a fire in the mind."

29:20.867 --> 29:22.450
It wasn't the quote
that caught Sunny's eye,

29:22.533 --> 29:25.575
nor was it the reference to fire
that set Violet's heart racing.

29:25.658 --> 29:26.783
It was the handwriting.

29:26.867 --> 29:29.492
<i>For when Violet saw
the strong left lean of the L's,</i>

29:29.575 --> 29:32.408
<i>and the confident closed loop
of the O's, she knew who wrote it</i>

29:32.492 --> 29:35.617
<i>even before she saw the name
on the library checkout card.</i>

29:35.700 --> 29:37.533
"Bertrand Baudelaire."

29:37.617 --> 29:39.325
Or as Violet and Sunny knew him...

29:39.408 --> 29:40.825
Father!

29:41.343 --> 29:42.343
Da-da.

29:50.367 --> 29:52.158
They're good children.

29:52.242 --> 29:55.283
I don't see why we have to lie to them.
The truth is right there in your book.

29:55.367 --> 29:56.617
Not anymore.

29:57.242 --> 29:58.617
I had it redacted.

29:58.700 --> 30:01.783
- Sir, you defaced your own book?
- I didn't have a choice.

30:01.867 --> 30:05.950
Charles, we made certain deals
to keep this mill open.

30:06.033 --> 30:09.533
And if she wants us to cover up the truth
and blame the fire on the Baudelaires,

30:09.617 --> 30:12.242
well... that's the cost of doing business.

30:12.325 --> 30:13.950
Is it really worth it?

30:15.700 --> 30:17.825
This mill is all I have, Charles.

30:21.575 --> 30:22.575
And you.

30:23.658 --> 30:25.242
Of course I have you.

30:55.950 --> 30:57.117
Klaus Baudelaire.

30:58.075 --> 30:59.950
You're Dr. Orwell?

31:00.033 --> 31:02.575
Yes, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
I was on my lunch hour.

31:02.658 --> 31:04.492
Looks like somebody broke their glasses.

31:04.575 --> 31:06.700
See? Perfectly friendly.

31:06.783 --> 31:09.658
Well, you catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

31:09.742 --> 31:12.575
Actually, you catch the most flies
with manure.

31:12.658 --> 31:15.617
Aren't you smart?
It's just an expression.

31:15.700 --> 31:18.575
A fancy way of saying you're more likely
to get what you want

31:18.658 --> 31:23.492
by acting in a sweet way,
than in a distasteful way, like vinegar.

31:25.658 --> 31:26.742
Wave goodbye to your friend.

31:28.117 --> 31:29.408
Goodbye?

31:34.408 --> 31:37.325
Is this really necessary
to fix my glasses?

31:37.408 --> 31:40.117
An eye exam is standard procedure
for all my patients.

31:42.367 --> 31:43.992
You look nervous.

31:44.075 --> 31:46.992
Father always said he didn't trust
optimists or optometrists.

31:47.075 --> 31:50.367
Well, sounds like he may have had
a bad experience with one.

31:50.450 --> 31:51.700
I wonder who she was.

31:51.783 --> 31:54.117
Or if she ever practiced
optometry again...

31:55.408 --> 31:59.283
after the heartbreak, and the lawsuit

31:59.367 --> 32:03.700
and the plastic surgery to assume
a new identity in a faraway town.

32:03.783 --> 32:06.158
- What did you say?
- I said try not to blink.

32:08.033 --> 32:12.908
You're a smart boy.
Do you know what bedside manner means?

32:12.992 --> 32:16.325
- It's when...
- It's when a doctor speaks

32:16.408 --> 32:22.408
in a calm and reassuring voice
to make sure his patients trust him.

32:24.367 --> 32:26.450
And how are we feeling, Klaus?

32:27.533 --> 32:30.117
- Not good.
- Because you broke your glasses.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.825
Because of this town.

32:31.908 --> 32:35.158
Everyone thinks our parents did
this bad thing,

32:35.242 --> 32:36.450
but they never even met them.

32:36.533 --> 32:39.242
Well, I'm not like everyone else.

32:39.825 --> 32:40.867
You don't believe it.

32:42.533 --> 32:44.117
I met your parents.

32:49.533 --> 32:51.575
Standard procedure
for nervous little boys.

32:52.575 --> 32:53.658
That's standard, too.

32:53.742 --> 32:55.992
Now focus here, Klaus,
and tell me what you see.

32:56.075 --> 32:57.117
An E or an A?

32:57.200 --> 32:59.033
- An...
- An E or an A?

32:59.117 --> 33:00.992
- An A.
- An A or a C?

33:01.075 --> 33:03.283
- A C.
- A sea or a lake?

33:03.367 --> 33:05.658
- Wait, what?
- A reptile or an amphibian?

33:05.742 --> 33:07.367
Fire or accident?

33:07.450 --> 33:09.700
A blonde or a bottle blonde?

33:09.783 --> 33:11.950
A parent or an arsonist?

33:12.033 --> 33:13.950
Tell me what you see, Klaus.

33:17.825 --> 33:22.992
Yes, you little bookworm,
tell us what you see.

33:29.408 --> 33:30.867
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

33:30.950 --> 33:33.492
Why don't you play a game of solitaire
to pass the time?

33:39.367 --> 33:40.492
- Violet?
- Hmm?

33:40.575 --> 33:41.992
That's not a window.

33:48.867 --> 33:49.700
Lights out.

34:06.908 --> 34:08.074
Klaus?

34:10.158 --> 34:12.408
We were worried.
You were gone so long.

34:13.574 --> 34:16.867
You're not wearing your glasses.
Are they still being fixed?

34:18.533 --> 34:21.867
What was it like inside the eye? Klaus?

34:26.324 --> 34:27.617
You're smiling.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.033
I'm happy to be here, sir.

34:29.617 --> 34:32.324
What? I'm not Sir. I'm your sister.

34:32.408 --> 34:34.742
While you were gone,
I heard Sir talking to Charles.

34:35.783 --> 34:38.158
He said he made a deal
to cover something up.

34:41.824 --> 34:43.617
There's something bigger going on here.

34:43.699 --> 34:44.824
- Shh.
- Quiet.

34:45.449 --> 34:46.824
Did you hear what I said?

34:49.158 --> 34:50.949
I guess it's been a long day.

34:51.533 --> 34:52.742
Would you like to go to sleep?

34:53.992 --> 34:55.033
Yes, sir.

34:56.658 --> 34:58.033
Your shoes are still on.

34:58.992 --> 35:00.158
Klaus?

35:08.700 --> 35:11.867
I promised our parents
I'd always look out for Klaus.

35:11.950 --> 35:13.617
But I didn't.

35:13.700 --> 35:15.825
He wanted to leave and I made him stay.

35:17.242 --> 35:20.617
Except now he's acting strange.
It's all my fault.

35:24.075 --> 35:25.825
There's no one else to fix it.

35:30.117 --> 35:32.367
<i>Get up, lumber laborers.</i>

35:32.450 --> 35:35.658
<i>Lucky Smells has no time for dawdling.</i>

35:35.742 --> 35:40.617
<i>Klaus Baude-liar, would you like
to get out of bed this instant?</i>

35:40.700 --> 35:44.200
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Would you like to bring your baby sister?</i>

35:50.450 --> 35:51.450
Klaus?

36:05.658 --> 36:07.700
Lucky boy.

36:07.783 --> 36:09.158
It's wood chipper day.

36:09.242 --> 36:10.908
Would you like to make some mulch?

36:31.408 --> 36:32.575
What are you doing?

36:34.617 --> 36:37.742
You're frightening Sunny and
you're frightening me. What's going on?

36:41.533 --> 36:44.825
Lucky Smells Lumbermill. This is he.

36:46.450 --> 36:49.117
The Baudelaire orphans
working here at the mill?

36:49.200 --> 36:51.242
That's ridiculous. They're children.

36:52.075 --> 36:53.450
They're probably somewhere

36:53.533 --> 36:56.867
enjoying a hot cup of coffee
in front of a roaring fire...

36:57.992 --> 37:00.450
wherever they are,
which certainly isn't here.

37:00.533 --> 37:01.908
Now, who is this?

37:04.242 --> 37:06.825
Hello?

37:15.492 --> 37:18.700
- What's wrong?
- With me? Nothing.

37:18.783 --> 37:20.700
We've fought a host
of unsavory characters,

37:20.783 --> 37:23.367
including a most unfriendly
refrigerator repair person.

37:23.450 --> 37:24.742
We've flown a plane into a hurricane.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.658
We've been to Peru and back
to get home to our children.

37:26.742 --> 37:29.950
And today, finally, we'll all be together.

37:30.033 --> 37:31.075
What could be wrong?

37:47.450 --> 37:49.783
Stop it and we can leave.

37:49.867 --> 37:53.242
Lucky Smells is our life.
Lucky Smells is our home.

37:53.325 --> 37:54.450
No, it's not.

37:54.533 --> 37:58.367
A home is where people take care of you,
not make you work in a mill for gum.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.783
I should've listened to you
when you wanted to go.

38:00.867 --> 38:02.533
If you're still in there,

38:02.617 --> 38:05.825
I want you to know I miss you
an inordinate amount.

38:13.117 --> 38:14.783
Inordinate?

38:14.867 --> 38:17.533
What...
what the heck does that mean?

38:17.617 --> 38:20.408
It can mean many things.
Immoderate, irregular.

38:20.492 --> 38:22.825
But in this case, I think it means
you missed me a lot.

38:23.825 --> 38:26.617
- Klaus, you're back!
- Where was I?

38:28.117 --> 38:29.700
Why am I not wearing shoes?

38:30.325 --> 38:32.200
We'll have to explain
how you hurt your leg.

38:32.283 --> 38:33.867
- Ballroom dancing?
- They'll believe that.

38:33.950 --> 38:35.200
They've seen you dance.

38:41.825 --> 38:43.700
I don't know what's going on here,
but we need to...

38:43.783 --> 38:45.117
Baude-liars!

38:45.200 --> 38:48.492
- We need to...
- I'm talking to you, lumber brats.

38:48.575 --> 38:53.242
Go to the very fancy door.
You have visitors.

38:59.325 --> 39:01.283
Ah, there you are, children.

39:01.367 --> 39:03.658
Now, I know your time here
hasn't been peachy,

39:03.742 --> 39:05.700
but your luck is about to change.

39:05.783 --> 39:08.742
Because I brought you... this peach.

39:09.325 --> 39:10.533
But who's visiting us?

39:10.617 --> 39:11.783
Oh, I don't know.

39:11.867 --> 39:14.867
But they can't come inside,
because that would be trespassing,

39:14.950 --> 39:16.575
and then they'd be put to work.

39:17.283 --> 39:22.200
But I can tell you they are just
on the other side of that very fancy door.

39:49.283 --> 39:50.283
Children?

39:51.158 --> 39:52.117
Children?

39:52.617 --> 39:54.325
Duncan, Quigley, Isadora?

39:54.408 --> 39:55.450
Mother?

39:56.367 --> 39:57.325
Father!

39:58.408 --> 40:00.700
- Get over here, you three.
- How was your work trip?

40:00.783 --> 40:02.283
Oh, we're just happy to be home.

40:02.367 --> 40:03.492
How did you hurt your leg?

40:03.575 --> 40:05.283
Breaking out of prison in Peru.

40:11.492 --> 40:15.408
I beg you, turn this program off now.
Imagine this story has a happy ending.

40:15.492 --> 40:18.033
You can pretend the woman at the door
is the Duchess of Winnipeg,

40:18.117 --> 40:20.658
and she's come to throw the Baudelaires
a pony party at her chateau.

40:20.742 --> 40:24.825
Or you can pretend that she's a butler
with a tray of blueberry pancakes,

40:24.908 --> 40:27.617
or a loving parent
that you thought you'd never see again.

40:27.700 --> 40:30.492
But if you choose to watch on,
let me warn you,

40:30.575 --> 40:32.283
the misery does not end here.

40:32.367 --> 40:36.242
In fact, I visited Paltryville myself
many years later.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.992
It was long after the Lucky Smells
Lumbermill had closed its doors...

40:42.742 --> 40:45.492
and Dr. Orwell's office
had fallen into disrepair.

40:45.575 --> 40:48.617
Of course, the building wasn't originally
an optometrist office at all,

40:48.700 --> 40:51.117
but the headquarters
of a secret organization.

40:55.075 --> 40:58.075
That is where I learned what happened
to Klaus Baudelaire.

40:59.075 --> 41:01.408
Poor, poor Klaus Baudelaire.

41:02.242 --> 41:05.742
It's enough to make you want to abandon
civilization and live by a pond.

41:05.825 --> 41:07.450
But if you choose to look this misery
in the eye,

41:07.533 --> 41:08.992
you should be asking one question.

41:09.075 --> 41:11.950
It's the same question
that the Baudelaires should've asked,

41:12.033 --> 41:14.783
my beloved Beatrice should've asked
on the day that she died.

41:14.867 --> 41:15.950
And that question is...

41:19.492 --> 41:21.617
where is Count Olaf?

41:22.325 --> 41:25.367
My, my, my, my, my!

41:25.450 --> 41:28.492
Aren't you a lucky boy?

41:34.742 --> 41:36.033
Yes, sir.

41:44.575 --> 41:47.992
Lucky Smells Lumbermill.
Yeah, this is he.

41:49.617 --> 41:52.575
The Baudelaire orphans,
working at the mill?

41:52.658 --> 41:54.492
Well, that's ridiculous.

41:54.575 --> 41:57.617
You might be wondering about the identity
of the mysterious caller

41:57.700 --> 42:00.533
who rang to inquire about the Baudelaires.

42:01.325 --> 42:02.992
I've conducted extensive research,

42:03.075 --> 42:05.325
and all that I can tell you is that,
whoever it was...

42:05.408 --> 42:06.575
Now, who is this?

42:08.825 --> 42:09.992
Hello?

42:10.075 --> 42:11.533
they were of no help whatsoever.

42:13.408 --> 42:14.617
Hmm, well...

42:15.783 --> 42:17.283
Let's see what's next on the list.
