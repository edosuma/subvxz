\hbefore the board
realizes that you

00:08.462 --> 00:09.759
swiped an opportunity
from underneath them.

00:09.759 --> 00:11.858
\h\h\h\h\h-What do you want?
-A healthy percentage of our

00:11.858 --> 00:13.099
growing supplement business.

00:13.099 --> 00:14.759
I loved my sister very much.

00:14.759 --> 00:16.957
<i>The grief and guilt

Mina, these intervals
\h\h\hlook good to me.

00:48.891 --> 00:51.330
\h\h\h\h\h\h-Second opinion?
-Agree. QT isn’t prolonged.

00:51.330 --> 00:53.759
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hGreat.
Azithromycin it is.

00:53.759 --> 00:57.264
I am writing you a prescription

00:57.264 --> 00:59.660
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYou can pick it up
at the mobile pharmacy outside.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.396
-How many people have you seen?
-18 or 19.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.264
We have to see them faster.
\h\hI just looked outside--

01:04.264 --> 01:05.891
the line’s even longer
than when we got here.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.429
Where are they all coming from?

01:07.429 --> 01:09.891
Mountains, remote farms, towns.

01:09.891 --> 01:11.429
It’s a medical dead zone
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hfor miles.

01:11.429 --> 01:13.000
No hospital anywhere nearby.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.825
It’s hard to believe we’re only
three hours outside of Atlanta.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.726
But here we are.

01:18.726 --> 01:20.363
I wheeze all the time.

01:20.363 --> 01:22.165

the right way.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.099
\h\h\h\h\h\hNo more spinning.
(chuckles) Thank you, that...

01:33.099 --> 01:35.792
is that like some kind of yoga

01:35.792 --> 01:37.528
-or tai chi or something?
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-(chuckles)

01:37.528 --> 01:40.264
You’re like some sort of guru.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(chuckles)

01:40.264 --> 01:41.792
Yeah.

01:41.792 --> 01:43.759
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hCLARA:
\h\h\h\hThey were able
to make your glasses.

01:46.198 --> 01:47.957
I can read the sign.

01:48.726 --> 01:50.957
-How do I look?
\h\h\h-Perfect.

01:50.957 --> 01:52.891
(both chuckle)

01:52.891 --> 01:55.264
That baby took a three-hour nap?

01:55.264 --> 01:56.297
\h\h\h\h\h(chuckles)
You have to tell me

01:56.297 --> 01:58.429
how to make her do that
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hat night.

01:58.429 --> 02:00.891
\h\h\h\h\h-Thank you.
-I’m going to propose

02:00.891 --> 02:03.429
\h\h\h-Not what I expected.
-Um, why isn’t Conrad here?

02:03.429 --> 02:06.000
\h\hDo not tell him

02:06.000 --> 02:07.825

02:07.825 --> 02:08.924
I know. Me too.

02:08.924 --> 02:11.330
But Search & Rescue
\h\hjust called him

\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hSo...

\h\h\hOh.

02:27.924 --> 02:29.726
\hSearch & Rescue,

\h\h\h\h(chuckles)
It’s not for you.

02:31.924 --> 02:34.165

\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Oh,

\h\h\h\h\h\h\hright.
Your volunteer work.

Why is this door locked?

04:34.693 --> 04:37.594
Archer, open the door.

04:37.594 --> 04:40.033
We’ve never locked that door.
\h\h\h\h\h\hArcher, answer me.

\h\h\h\h\h\h\hThe cost--

07:58.825 --> 08:00.429
Too young for Medicare,

08:00.429 --> 08:02.957
too much money for Medicaid,
and our insurance deductible

08:02.957 --> 08:05.198

And then, after the surgery,

08:08.759 --> 08:10.561
this arrived.

Chastain used an out-of-network

08:17.000 --> 08:19.165
who charged $15,000?

08:19.165 --> 08:22.132
Did Chastain make you aware
of the out-of-network cost?

08:22.132 --> 08:25.099
\h\hNo. But we thought
that it was a mistake.

08:25.099 --> 08:28.099
We couldn’t pay that,
\hso Red Rock sued us.

with you by my side.

08:47.726 --> 08:49.891
Uh, the ambulance is here.

08:49.891 --> 08:51.627
(engine idling in distance)

08:51.627 --> 08:53.132
No, I’m not gonna go.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.726
\h\hWho’s gonna pay
for that ambulance?

08:54.726 --> 08:56.297
We’ve known each other
a long time-- you know

08:56.297 --> 08:58.132
\hI’ll do everything
in my power to help.

08:58.132 --> 09:01.033
\h\h\hBut right now we need
to get you to the hospital,

09:01.033 --> 09:03.891
and that is nonnegotiable,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hmy friend.

09:06.132 --> 09:09.099
\h\h\h\h\h(whispers):
Hey. Keep an eye him.

09:12.165 --> 09:13.858
(indistinct radio chatter)

09:13.858 --> 09:16.132
Hey, Jen.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.396
\h\h\hNo meds.
No restraints.

09:18.396 --> 09:20.363
He’ll come out willingly.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYou just...

09:20.363 --> 09:21.891
-(Adelaide screaming)
\h\h\h\h\h\h-(gunshot)

09:21.891 --> 09:24.561
\h\h-What happened?
-KYLE: He had a gun
\h\h\hin the drawer.

09:24.561 --> 09:25.924
\h\h\h\hHe pulled it out.
He pointed it at his head.

09:25.924 --> 09:27.825
I tried to grab it from him,
\h\h\h\h\h\hand it went off,

09:27.825 --> 09:30.264
-and it hit him in the stomach.
-Adelaide, put pressure here.

09:30.264 --> 09:31.693
-Kyle, grab his legs.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-What?

09:31.693 --> 09:33.000
\h\h\h\h\h-Grab his legs.
-Where are the paramedics?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.660
\h\h\h\h\hAfter gunfire, they
can’t come in until the police

09:34.660 --> 09:37.066
\hget here-- that’s the law,
so we go to them. Let’s go.

09:45.297 --> 09:47.066
\h\h\h\hDEVON:
Let me guess,

09:47.066 --> 09:49.594
you’ve been taking unregulated
colloidal silver supplements.

09:49.594 --> 09:51.396
For how long?

09:51.396 --> 09:53.594
Uh, over a year.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.693
Well, that’s why you’re blue.

09:55.693 --> 09:56.957
It’s called argyria.

09:56.957 --> 09:58.396
It’s rare but it happens.

09:58.396 --> 10:00.231
When did your skin
\hstart to change?

10:00.231 --> 10:01.528
Uh, it was a while ago.

10:01.528 --> 10:03.132
\h\h\hIt started off
a little light gray,

10:03.132 --> 10:04.924
but then it just kept going
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hfrom there.

10:04.924 --> 10:07.594
You know, I read an article that
said it would cure everything.

10:07.594 --> 10:09.396
What needed to be cured?

10:09.396 --> 10:11.594
Exhaustion.
Sore joints.

10:11.594 --> 10:13.099
The silver was supposed to scrub

10:13.099 --> 10:15.099
\h\h\h\hall the toxins
from my blood, but...

10:15.099 --> 10:17.528
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hthis morning
I could barely crawl out of bed.

10:17.528 --> 10:19.561
Well, we’ll start by running
\h\h\h\h\hsome tests, okay?

10:19.561 --> 10:22.264
\h\h\h\hJust curious: when you
first went from gray to blue,

10:22.264 --> 10:26.066
you didn’t think, "I might have
a bit of a problem here"?

10:27.396 --> 10:29.561
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNo.
I thought it was cool.

10:40.561 --> 10:42.957
-(clears throat)
-Andrea Braydon.

10:44.396 --> 10:46.396
Uh, Dr. AJ Austin.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.561
Cardio-thoracic surgery.

10:48.561 --> 10:50.132
\h\h\hWhy do doctors always
name-check their specialty--

10:50.132 --> 10:52.462
is it so people will know
\h\hhow important you are?

10:53.627 --> 10:55.363
Well, this job is an extension

10:55.363 --> 10:56.957
of our personality, so it just

10:56.957 --> 10:59.363
seems natural to mention it.

11:00.330 --> 11:01.759
And yes, it’s so

11:01.759 --> 11:04.924
\h\h\hpeople will know
how important we are.

11:04.924 --> 11:06.924
What you got there?

11:06.924 --> 11:10.594
\h\h\h\h\h\hUh, 3B Life. It is
a revolutionary dietary herbal

11:10.594 --> 11:12.198
and energy supplement.

11:12.198 --> 11:15.594
\h\h\hOf course. So you are
Bell and Cain’s new partner.

11:15.594 --> 11:17.924
They’re the new partners.
\h\h\h\h\hI’m the founder.

11:17.924 --> 11:19.429
\hSo now who needs
to feel important?

11:19.429 --> 11:22.132
\h\h\h\h(chuckles)
You want a sample?

11:22.132 --> 11:24.594
My supplement can decrease
your risk of heart attack.

11:24.594 --> 11:26.297
Oh, my heart is a specimen.

11:26.297 --> 11:27.627
Improve your mental acuity.

11:27.627 --> 11:29.132
My mind is at the top
\h\h\h\h\hof its game.

11:29.132 --> 11:30.627
Increase your stamina.

11:30.627 --> 11:32.792
(chuckles)
\hPlease.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.825
\h(laughs):
Okay, right.

11:34.825 --> 11:37.066
\h\h\h\h\hTell you what,
if you change your mind,

11:37.066 --> 11:39.297
\hgive me a call,
I’ll hook you up.

11:42.726 --> 11:45.726
And if you don’t change
\h\h\h\h\h\hyour mind...

11:45.726 --> 11:48.099
you should still call me.

11:49.033 --> 11:50.396
Okay.

11:50.396 --> 11:52.462
Unless you’re spoken for.

11:56.033 --> 11:57.462
Thanks.

12:02.495 --> 12:05.066
\h\h-JOYCE: Oh, my God.
I don’t want to be here.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Come on.

12:05.066 --> 12:07.528
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-You know what,
\h\hI said I didn’t want to go.
-Come on, come on. We’re coming.

12:07.528 --> 12:09.297
-And besides...
-Come on. Joyce!

12:10.891 --> 12:13.000
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h<i>\hMINA:
Last ones. You two are lucky</i>

12:13.000 --> 12:14.660
-you made it in time.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Mm.

12:14.660 --> 12:17.033
Four hours of back roads,
and with that one driving,

12:17.033 --> 12:18.891
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hwe’re lucky we
didn’t fly off the mountain.

12:18.891 --> 12:21.561
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Stop it.
-So, which one of you is Joyce?

12:21.561 --> 12:24.066
\hThat one. I’m Bianca,
but this isn’t about me.

12:24.066 --> 12:26.330
My sister hasn’t seen a doctor
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hin years.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.495
\h\h\h\h-If it ain’t broke,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hdon’t fix it.
-NIC (chuckles): All right.

12:28.495 --> 12:30.363
Well, let’s check you out.

12:30.363 --> 12:31.627
Deep breath in.

12:33.957 --> 12:35.231
Lungs sound clear.

12:35.231 --> 12:36.693
Mm-hmm. Told you.

12:36.693 --> 12:39.231
(steady beeping)

12:39.231 --> 12:40.429
What’s that?

12:40.429 --> 12:43.198
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hThat is
a ventricular assist device.

12:43.198 --> 12:45.924
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(chuckles):
Yeah. That’s my VAD right there.

12:45.924 --> 12:48.627
\hWhen my own heart went to crap
five years ago, they cut me open

12:48.627 --> 12:50.363
and put it in.

12:50.363 --> 12:52.891
\h\h\h\hThis powers the machine
inside me so it can pump blood.

12:52.891 --> 12:55.528
You know, like hearts do
\hwhen they’re not crap.

12:55.528 --> 12:58.396
\h\h\h\h\h\hI’m basically
a battery-operated woman.

12:58.396 --> 13:00.363
Saved my life.

13:00.363 --> 13:01.726
Why is it beeping?

13:01.726 --> 13:03.363
Oh, must need a battery change.

13:03.363 --> 13:06.165
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hJOYCE:
Hold tight. I’ll find ’em.

13:06.165 --> 13:09.000
(beeping continues)

13:10.891 --> 13:12.660
No, you won’t.

13:13.825 --> 13:16.495
They’re on the counter at home.

13:18.429 --> 13:19.891
JOYCE:
\hI...

13:19.891 --> 13:22.099
told you to put ’em in the bag.

13:22.099 --> 13:24.165
Wh-Where’s your hand pump?

13:24.165 --> 13:26.000
That’s at home, too.

13:27.330 --> 13:28.594
Where’s the nearest drugstore?

13:28.594 --> 13:30.099
\h\h\hI can run out
and grab batteries.

13:30.099 --> 13:31.726
A drugstore won’t carry
\hthat kind of battery.

13:31.726 --> 13:34.165
\h\h\h\h\hWe need a hospital
or the device manufacturer.

13:34.165 --> 13:36.726
\h\hI’ll call Life Flight, see
if they can arrange a chopper.

13:36.726 --> 13:38.099
Maybe a local VAD patient
\h\h\h\h\h\hhas an extra.

13:38.099 --> 13:39.660
What-what if Bianca’s battery
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hruns out?

13:40.627 --> 13:42.330
Then I die.

13:45.330 --> 13:47.264
Two VAD patients in the area--
\h\h\h\hneither are answering

13:47.264 --> 13:49.495
their phone, and Life Flight
doesn’t have a free chopper.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.198
The manufacturer has batteries,
but they’re not local

13:51.198 --> 13:52.858
and can’t get them here in time.

13:52.858 --> 13:54.429
The nearest hospital
\h\h\h\his Chastain,

13:54.429 --> 13:56.165
-three hours away.
\h\h-So this woman

13:56.165 --> 13:58.660
will die because we’re too far
\h\h\hfrom a friggin’ battery?

13:59.825 --> 14:02.132
\h\h\h\h\h\hDon’t forget
the portable ultrasound.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.264
\h\h\h\h<i>\hAUSTIN:
\hAlready in with
the VAD batteries.</i>

14:04.264 --> 14:05.924
Go. I’ll text you
\hthe coordinates

14:05.924 --> 14:07.132
of the clinic van--
\h\h\hwith any luck,

14:07.132 --> 14:08.627
-you’ll meet them there halfway.
<i>-So if we</i>

14:08.627 --> 14:11.099
-don’t hit any red lights...
\h\h\h\h<i>\h-You’ll have a chance</i>

14:11.099 --> 14:12.957
to get the new batteries
\h\h\hinto your patient

14:12.957 --> 14:14.297
before she dies.
\h\hAnd, Mina...

14:14.297 --> 14:16.561
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Ready?
-Okay, we’re leaving. Thank you.

14:18.033 --> 14:19.660
Drive safely.

14:19.660 --> 14:22.792
Whoa, whoa. Uh, you ever get
\h\h\hany speeding tickets?

14:22.792 --> 14:24.726
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-No.
-Then I’m driving.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.957
(beeping continues)

14:30.231 --> 14:32.066
Gunshot wound in the abdomen.

14:32.066 --> 14:34.165
\h\h\hBP: 80/50.
Heartrate: 140.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.231
We got to get him to the O.R.

14:36.231 --> 14:38.297
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYou know we have
to take this from here, right?

14:39.726 --> 14:41.231
Hey. We got him.

14:41.231 --> 14:43.495
I promise.

14:43.495 --> 14:46.330
Dr. Hawkins, please go with him.
You’re his doctor.

14:46.330 --> 14:47.759
I can’t.

14:53.528 --> 14:55.528
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBELL:
Wow, look who’s back.

14:55.528 --> 14:57.429
-Oh, you look great.
\h\h-Oh, thank you.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.099
\h\hOh.
(laughs)

14:59.099 --> 15:02.726
My hair’s still growing back,
\h\h\h\h\h\hso hence the wig.

15:02.726 --> 15:04.264
\h-Oh.
-Yeah,

15:04.264 --> 15:06.759
but at least I’m clear for work,
in theory.

15:06.759 --> 15:08.825
Well, Chastain’s made
\h\h\h\ha few changes.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.396
There are two new scrub nurses.
We’re looking for a third.

15:11.396 --> 15:13.759
So you won’t be working
any more double shifts.

15:13.759 --> 15:16.198
Yeah. Doesn’t look like
I’ll be working at all.

15:16.198 --> 15:18.495
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI’m not
on any surgeon’s schedule.

15:18.495 --> 15:21.891
\h\h\hWell, word probably hasn’t
gotten around that you’re back.

15:21.891 --> 15:23.264
Mm-hmm.

15:23.264 --> 15:24.957
Or...

15:24.957 --> 15:27.462
\h\h\h\h\hyour colleagues
just want to ease you in.

15:27.462 --> 15:30.066
Or... no one trusts me
in an operating room,

15:30.066 --> 15:32.726
because my brain is, um...

15:32.726 --> 15:36.066
Oh, like in a-a skillet,

15:36.066 --> 15:37.561
a-an egg...

15:37.561 --> 15:39.363
Your brain is not fried.

15:39.363 --> 15:41.066
\h\h\h\h\h-Yeah.
-That’s normal.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.099
You’re gonna have trouble
finding words for a while.

15:43.099 --> 15:44.528
\hYou’re recovering
from major surgery.

15:45.759 --> 15:46.957
Do you have any trouble
\h\h\h\h\hunderstanding

15:46.957 --> 15:48.132
words that are spoken to you?

15:48.132 --> 15:50.462
No.

15:50.462 --> 15:52.429
Then you are ready.

15:52.429 --> 15:55.000
And you’ll be with me today.
\h\h\h\h\h\hPut her in six.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.660
No. No, no, no. You don’t have
\hto do that just to be nice.

15:59.297 --> 16:00.594
Ask around.

16:00.594 --> 16:03.066
Nobody’s ever accused me
\h\h\h\h\hof being nice.

16:03.066 --> 16:04.165
(laughs)

16:05.396 --> 16:07.462
I’ll see you in the O.R.

16:12.264 --> 16:14.759
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBELL:
Bowel is torn to shreds.

16:14.759 --> 16:17.297
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNOLAN:
Mm, close-range bullet.
\h\hNo surprises there.

16:17.297 --> 16:18.594
\hBELL:
Lap pad.

16:18.594 --> 16:20.726
At least no major vessels
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hwere hit.

16:20.726 --> 16:21.759
\h\hNOLAN:
Lucky guy.

16:21.759 --> 16:23.396
\h\h\hSo you thinking
colostomy here, or...

16:23.396 --> 16:24.924
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBELL:
\h\hOh, I hope not.
That’d be a disaster

16:24.924 --> 16:26.264
for this man.

16:26.264 --> 16:28.132
\h\h\h\hHe already has MS.
That’s enough to deal with

16:28.132 --> 16:29.462
without a colostomy bag.

16:29.462 --> 16:30.693
Do you need the...

16:33.429 --> 16:34.759
Retractor.

16:34.759 --> 16:36.264
Yes. Perfect.

16:41.627 --> 16:44.033
Why couldn’t Dr. Hawkins
\h\h\h\hgo with Archer?

16:45.858 --> 16:48.363
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBecause he
doesn’t work here anymore.

16:48.363 --> 16:50.429
He doesn’t? Why not?

16:50.429 --> 16:52.264
The hospital let him go.

16:52.264 --> 16:54.297
People are very upset.

16:54.297 --> 16:55.759
(sighs)

16:55.759 --> 16:58.264
They’ve got to be insane.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.462
\hWhen do we hear
from the surgeon?

17:03.462 --> 17:05.198
As soon as the operation
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\his over.

17:06.165 --> 17:08.396
I don’t understand...

17:08.396 --> 17:10.462
how this happened.

17:12.297 --> 17:15.726
\h\h\hHow could I not see
that he was planning this?

17:17.462 --> 17:20.132
What kind of wife am I?

17:21.825 --> 17:23.858
Adelaide, I...

17:23.858 --> 17:26.396
I-I don’t know your husband.

17:26.396 --> 17:28.528
But I do know one thing.

17:29.660 --> 17:31.330
You didn’t see any of this

17:31.330 --> 17:33.363
\h\h\h\h\h\hbecause Archer
didn’t want you to see it.

17:33.363 --> 17:36.033
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hADELAIDE:
We always told each other
\h\h\h\h\h\h\heverything.

17:36.033 --> 17:38.165
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hKYLE:
He was protecting you

17:38.165 --> 17:40.132
because he loves you.

17:42.231 --> 17:44.099
And he blames himself

17:44.099 --> 17:47.297
\h\h\h\hfor all this trouble
that you’re both in, and...

17:48.660 --> 17:50.825
So he feels ashamed.

17:50.825 --> 17:52.891
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI’m sure that
he’s been racking his brain

17:52.891 --> 17:55.330
\h\h\htrying to find
any way out of this,

17:55.330 --> 17:58.891
any way to live out his life
\h\h\h\h\h\hwith you and...

17:58.891 --> 18:02.132
\hstill make sure
that you’re safe.

18:03.891 --> 18:06.627
But he just couldn’t find
\h\h\h\hany other answer.

18:08.198 --> 18:11.924
\h\h\h\h\h\hAny way to save
the person that he loves...

18:11.924 --> 18:13.957
and stop being a burden.

18:17.264 --> 18:19.594
\h\h\h\h\h\hIf someone
is desperate enough...

18:19.594 --> 18:22.099
the worst solution in the world

18:22.099 --> 18:25.000
\h\h\hstarts to look like
a pretty damn good thing.

18:32.264 --> 18:34.792
Says take a left here.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNow.

18:37.891 --> 18:39.462
(VAD beeps louder)

18:39.462 --> 18:42.264
\h\h\h\h\hI-It’s louder.
Wh-Why is it doing that?

18:42.264 --> 18:44.759
That’s the VAD system telling us
that more battery has drained.

18:44.759 --> 18:46.000
How much longer do I have?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.099
15 minutes.

18:47.099 --> 18:48.429
Maybe half an hour.

18:48.429 --> 18:50.099
\h\h\hThen it will go
to the backup battery,

18:50.099 --> 18:51.825
-and another 15 minutes.
-Where’s the ambulance?

18:52.924 --> 18:55.264
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIt’s saying
we’re still 52 minutes apart.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.561
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hCLARA:
If we both go faster,

18:56.561 --> 18:57.891
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hwe can still
make it together in time.

18:57.891 --> 18:59.561
This is my fault.

18:59.561 --> 19:01.660
I didn’t need to see a doctor.

19:01.660 --> 19:03.429
\h\h\h\h\h\hStop that.
They’re my batteries.

19:03.429 --> 19:04.924
They’re my responsibility.

19:04.924 --> 19:06.594
I forgot ’em, and...

19:06.594 --> 19:08.363
here we are.

19:12.330 --> 19:14.297
Pay attention, Joyce.

19:14.297 --> 19:16.627
Social security numbers.

19:16.627 --> 19:19.132
Bank account passwords.

19:19.132 --> 19:22.099
\h\h\h\h\hUm, the combo
for the lock on my bike.

19:22.099 --> 19:24.594
I know nobody rides it,
\h\h\hbut just in case.

19:24.594 --> 19:26.759
In the left-hand drawer
\h\hin the laundry room

19:26.759 --> 19:29.462
are the appliance warranties
\hand also the instructions

19:29.462 --> 19:31.627
for the remote control.

19:31.627 --> 19:32.957
\h\h\h\hI guess you get
to watch your game shows

19:32.957 --> 19:34.528
every night after all.

19:37.429 --> 19:38.759
Joyce.

19:38.759 --> 19:41.264
All this time--

19:41.264 --> 19:43.000
your heart,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.330
the batteries.

19:45.330 --> 19:48.462
\h\hI thought I was
taking care of you.

19:48.462 --> 19:51.363
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hBut you’ve
been taking care of me.

19:53.528 --> 19:55.693
We’ve been taking care
\h\h\h\hof each other.

19:58.495 --> 20:00.957
All right, here’s where
\h\h\h\hI keep the gold.

20:00.957 --> 20:03.561
Wha... Gold?

20:03.561 --> 20:07.396
I’m kidding. But I do have that
jar of pennies in the pantry.

20:07.396 --> 20:10.297
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(sighs)
The ambulance that’s meeting us

20:10.297 --> 20:11.858
better have its sirens on.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.066
Can I have a word?

20:19.066 --> 20:21.660
Absolutely.

20:21.660 --> 20:24.264
I need to tell you something.
\h\h\h\hIt’s a little awkward.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.924
Randolph Bell.

20:25.924 --> 20:28.000
Used to be CEO, now he’s not.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.825
Used to be chief of surgery.
\h\h\h\h\h\hThat’s all done.

20:30.825 --> 20:32.165
The guy can get his hands
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hon the ball,

20:32.165 --> 20:33.363
but he can’t keep it in the air.

20:33.363 --> 20:34.759
That hasn’t been my impression.

20:34.759 --> 20:36.495
-What’s your point?
-Don’t get me wrong,

20:36.495 --> 20:39.033
\h\hBell’s a decent salesman,
and the company will be fine,

20:39.033 --> 20:41.495
but... it could be
\hmore than fine.

20:42.759 --> 20:44.330
I can help increase revenues
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hexponentially

20:44.330 --> 20:45.891
through better marketing.

20:45.891 --> 20:47.825
You shouldn’t have to waste
\h\h\h\h\hyour valuable time

20:47.825 --> 20:49.231
with that penny-ante stuff.

20:49.231 --> 20:52.396
I’m having dinner tonight
\h\h\h\h\hwith an investor

20:52.396 --> 20:53.792
from a major advertising firm.

20:55.033 --> 20:57.132
You should join us.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.693
Sounds promising.
\h\h\hCount me in.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.264
I’ll do that.

21:11.891 --> 21:14.396
Adelaide said you were out here.

21:14.396 --> 21:16.231
The surgery was a success.
\h\h\h\hWe repaired enough

21:16.231 --> 21:18.264
\h\h\h\h\hof the bowel,
he won’t need an ostomy.

21:18.264 --> 21:20.891
So he will recover.

21:20.891 --> 21:24.627
Well, there’s no cure
\h\h\h\h\hfor the MS.

21:24.627 --> 21:28.066
\h\hAnd he’ll need treatment
for his suicidal depression.

21:28.066 --> 21:30.264
He won’t be able to pay
\h\h\h\hfor any of that.

21:30.264 --> 21:32.957
Do you know why he shot himself?

21:34.231 --> 21:37.066
-No, I don’t.
\h\h\h\h\h-Mm.

21:37.066 --> 21:40.429
\h\h\hChastain billed him for an
out-of-network anesthesiologist

21:40.429 --> 21:44.231
and then added on over 100,000
\h\h\h\hin unspecified charges

21:44.231 --> 21:46.759
-that his insurance can’t pay.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-(sighs)

21:46.759 --> 21:49.000
And then, just to kick him
\h\h\h\h\hwhile he’s down,

21:49.000 --> 21:50.825
Red Rock sued him.

21:57.099 --> 22:00.132
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI won’t bill
for my surgery today, and...

22:00.132 --> 22:02.132
-Thank you. That’s a start.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-And as for

22:02.132 --> 22:04.363
\h\h\h\hthe rest of it,
I’ll see what I can do.

22:05.594 --> 22:07.594
\hYou know, what Red Rock
did to you was not right.

22:07.594 --> 22:10.330
\h\h\h\h\hWell, they haven’t
treated you so well, either.

22:12.693 --> 22:14.759
What can I do for you?

22:14.759 --> 22:18.099
Archer’s my patient, and I’m
not even allowed to see him.

22:18.099 --> 22:20.363
Nothing’s filling that void.

22:33.594 --> 22:36.231
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h<i>\hMINA:
Where’s the ambulance now?</i>

22:36.231 --> 22:38.627
It’s been in the same place for
three minutes. Traffic, maybe?

22:38.627 --> 22:41.132
We’re still 30 minutes away.

22:41.132 --> 22:42.297
(VAD continues beeping)

22:42.297 --> 22:43.627
It says "backup battery mode."

22:43.627 --> 22:45.495
-No! No, no, no.
\h\h-It’s okay.

22:45.495 --> 22:47.792
-That means 15 minutes left.
\h\hKeep driving. -Joyce...

22:47.792 --> 22:50.066
-Drive faster.
\h\h\h-Joyce!

22:50.066 --> 22:52.693
\h\hI got five years
out of this machine.

22:52.693 --> 22:55.231
Bonus years I wouldn’t have had
if it hadn’t been for you

22:55.231 --> 22:57.231
\h\htaking care of me
through the operation,

22:57.231 --> 22:58.759
and after.

22:59.726 --> 23:02.066
They were good years.

23:03.561 --> 23:05.297
Thank you.

23:11.231 --> 23:14.000
Pull over.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.891
We still might be able
to reach them in time.

23:16.891 --> 23:19.099
Math says we won’t.
\h\h\h\h\hPull over.

23:19.099 --> 23:20.693
Bianca, we are not
giving up on you.

23:20.693 --> 23:24.231
Everyone in this van knows
the same thing: it’s over.

23:24.231 --> 23:27.033
\h\h\hYou know where
I don’t want to die?

23:27.033 --> 23:29.330
The back seat of a van.

23:31.099 --> 23:33.363
When I go out of this world,

23:33.363 --> 23:36.858
\h\hit’s gonna be
under the blue sky

23:36.858 --> 23:40.066
with the sun on my face.

23:40.066 --> 23:41.924
With my sister.

23:54.957 --> 23:56.858
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNIC:
Clara’s down the road.

23:56.858 --> 23:59.429
She’ll wave down the ambulance
\hthat’s carrying the battery.

23:59.429 --> 24:02.231
\h\h\h\h\h\hBIANCA:
Be straight with me.
\h\h\h\hThis is it.

24:02.231 --> 24:04.033
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hWe all know
it can’t get here in time.

24:04.033 --> 24:05.726
There’s still a chance.

24:05.726 --> 24:08.297
Nic, listen.

24:10.066 --> 24:12.132
I don’t want any heroics.

24:12.132 --> 24:15.429
No CPR that could break my ribs.

24:21.495 --> 24:23.330
I promise.

24:23.330 --> 24:24.825
Thank you.

24:33.726 --> 24:35.726
What’ll it be like

24:35.726 --> 24:37.462
when it happens?

24:39.759 --> 24:41.264
Uh...

24:41.264 --> 24:42.825
well, the...

24:42.825 --> 24:45.429
the battery will stop,

24:45.429 --> 24:48.726
and, um, you might feel
\h\h\h\ha little dizzy.

24:49.957 --> 24:52.957
And then you’ll close
\h\h\hyour eyes and...

24:52.957 --> 24:55.495
\h\h\h\hit will feel
like falling asleep.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.858
That’s good.

24:57.858 --> 24:59.924
Peaceful.

24:59.924 --> 25:02.198
That’s how I want it.

25:03.462 --> 25:05.132
We know

25:05.132 --> 25:07.198
you did everything you could.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.132
Now, shoo.

25:11.132 --> 25:13.792
I want to do my dying alone...
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(chuckles)

25:13.792 --> 25:15.330
with my sister.

25:16.297 --> 25:18.363
I love you so much.

25:28.132 --> 25:29.627
\h\h\h\h\h\hThe battery’s
less than ten miles away.

25:29.627 --> 25:32.033
\h\h\h-That’s too far.
-So we keep her alive
\h\h\huntil it comes.

25:32.033 --> 25:34.627
\h-We can’t do that.
\h-We can. If she’s
not down for long...

25:34.627 --> 25:36.792
Mina, stop.

25:36.792 --> 25:38.858
She doesn’t want
a violent death.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.495
Jessie.

25:42.495 --> 25:45.231
\h\h\h\h-(panting)
-(alarms beeping)

25:46.726 --> 25:49.198
(flatline)

25:51.231 --> 25:54.066
That moment outside her room--

25:54.066 --> 25:57.033
\h\hwhen it was happening and
there was nothing I could do.

25:59.825 --> 26:01.957
At least this--

26:03.726 --> 26:06.660
\h\hwe can let Bianca
go the way she wants.

26:07.924 --> 26:10.000
That we can do.

26:11.594 --> 26:15.231
(beeping slowing)

26:15.231 --> 26:17.495
It’s slowing down.

26:17.495 --> 26:19.561
Battery’s running out.

26:21.231 --> 26:23.495
I’m glad it’s sunny today.

26:25.429 --> 26:28.066
It’s pretty.

26:28.066 --> 26:29.924
Quiet.

26:29.924 --> 26:32.429
\h\hShe gets to hold
her sister’s hand...

26:32.429 --> 26:34.495
while she dies.

26:36.594 --> 26:38.792
At least they have that.

26:46.858 --> 26:48.924
(flatline)

27:03.924 --> 27:04.957
Uh...

27:04.957 --> 27:07.924
I’m actually not dead at all.

27:07.924 --> 27:10.000
She’s alive!

27:13.066 --> 27:14.627
-BIANCA: Oh...
\h-Oh, my God.

27:14.627 --> 27:16.891
My heart’s beating.

27:16.891 --> 27:19.429
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-What?
-Well, that’s different.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.627
-I’m definitely not dead.
\h\h\h\h\h-(Joyce laughs)

27:21.627 --> 27:24.594
Well, unless this is...

27:24.594 --> 27:26.594
-No, this can’t be Heaven.
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-(laughs)

27:26.594 --> 27:27.924
I mean, it’s nice here,

27:27.924 --> 27:30.759
\h\h\hbut there should be,
like, a river of ice cream

27:30.759 --> 27:32.066
and a field of roses

27:32.066 --> 27:33.297
and Chris Pine.

27:33.297 --> 27:35.660
Her pulse is strong and regular.

27:35.660 --> 27:38.099
\hThe VAD must have given
her heart time to repair.

27:38.099 --> 27:41.693
\hNow that the VAD stopped,
her heart is working again.

27:50.924 --> 27:52.594
How you feeling?

27:52.594 --> 27:55.297
Let me guess:
\hmethod actor

27:55.297 --> 27:57.693
\h\h\h\hprepping for his
Blue Man Group audition.

27:57.693 --> 28:00.264
\h\h\h\h\h\hOoh!
Smurf superfan.

28:00.264 --> 28:02.099
Patient information is private.

28:02.099 --> 28:05.165
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(groans)
I’m so tired of rules.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.429
Nadine, what’s really going on?

28:12.957 --> 28:15.528
I hit my head.
That was real.

28:15.528 --> 28:19.198
\h\hBut when I got here,
I was happy to see you.

28:20.528 --> 28:22.726
\h\hYou probably think
this is silly, but...

28:22.726 --> 28:25.561
most people act all weird
\hbecause I’m a princess.

28:25.561 --> 28:27.297
With a guard always around,

28:27.297 --> 28:30.297
I’m never alone, but...

28:30.297 --> 28:32.825
But you’re always lonely.

28:32.825 --> 28:35.693
You understand me.

28:35.693 --> 28:37.264
I still can’t keep you here
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hovernight.

28:40.132 --> 28:41.759
But...

28:41.759 --> 28:44.297
\h\h\hmaybe there’s
something we can do.

28:47.924 --> 28:50.561
\h\hTo be clear, now that
I’m not dead, I take back

28:50.561 --> 28:52.363
\h\hthat thing I said
about your game shows.

28:52.363 --> 28:53.660
I can live with that.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.363
Cardiac function is sufficient.

28:57.363 --> 28:59.363
Did I even need the VAD
\h\hin the first place?

28:59.363 --> 29:00.726
Yeah. The VAD saved your life.

29:00.726 --> 29:02.528
And then once it was in you,

29:02.528 --> 29:04.429
\hit gave your heart
enough time to heal.

29:04.429 --> 29:07.198
If that battery hadn’t run out,
we never would have known.

29:07.198 --> 29:08.561
(beeping)

29:11.066 --> 29:12.660
Now that there’s no blood

29:12.660 --> 29:14.462
running through the VAD,
\h\h\h\h\hit’s clotting.

29:15.759 --> 29:17.429
We need to get her
\hto Chastain now.

29:17.429 --> 29:19.759
\h\h\h-Get the gurney.
-I’m gonna call ahead
\h\h\hto book an O.R.

29:19.759 --> 29:22.099
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-What’s wrong?
-We need to get the VAD out.

29:22.099 --> 29:24.594
\h\hThere’s a clot,
and if it dislodges,

29:24.594 --> 29:26.099
it could be bad.

29:26.099 --> 29:28.825
You mean my sister could die?

29:30.594 --> 29:32.594
This time for real.

29:34.726 --> 29:37.264
\h\hThe gunshot guy
was exciting, sure,

29:37.264 --> 29:39.693
but five people with sniffles,

29:39.693 --> 29:41.429
a princess looking for love,

29:41.429 --> 29:43.561
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hand a blue guy
who caused his own problems--

29:43.561 --> 29:45.759
I mean, come on.

29:45.759 --> 29:47.429
Wait, why are we out here?

29:47.429 --> 29:50.429
Seems like you need a break
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hfrom the E.R.

29:50.429 --> 29:53.726
\h\hTell me, Ezra, why do you
want to go into anesthesiology

29:53.726 --> 29:55.264
after intern year?

29:55.264 --> 29:58.099
Fascinating physiology.
\h\h\h\h\h\hHigh stakes.

29:58.099 --> 30:00.000
Life and death every day.

30:01.264 --> 30:03.891
What else?

30:03.891 --> 30:06.231
To be honest, great hours.

30:06.231 --> 30:09.660
And I like patients
\h\h\hwho can’t talk

30:09.660 --> 30:11.660
because they’re asleep.

30:11.660 --> 30:13.165
Do you have OCD, Ezra?

30:13.165 --> 30:14.759
What? No, I do not.

30:14.759 --> 30:17.429
That’s absurd.

30:17.429 --> 30:18.594
\h\h\h\hI’ve seen you
pick at your buttons,

30:18.594 --> 30:21.231
double-check your stethoscope’s
in your pocket,

30:21.231 --> 30:22.462
check your phone
a billion times.

30:22.462 --> 30:26.264
\h\h\h\h\h\hFine, I-I’m...
I’m a control freak, okay?

30:26.264 --> 30:28.693
I also check the lock on my door

30:28.693 --> 30:31.330
ten times before bed.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.759
I buy pillowcases in bulk

30:32.759 --> 30:34.924
because I need a fresh one
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hevery day.

30:34.924 --> 30:36.429
I get up in the middle
\h\h\h\h\hof the night

30:36.429 --> 30:37.660
\h\h\h\h\h\hto make sure
the stove is really off.

30:37.660 --> 30:41.000
But that’s because
I’m super careful.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.264
If you’re an anesthesiologist,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hthat’s a virtue,

30:43.264 --> 30:46.099
because you can’t make
\h\ha single mistake.

30:46.099 --> 30:48.165
I respect super careful.

30:53.660 --> 30:56.165
So why don’t you take another
\hlook at Blue Billy’s scans.

30:59.132 --> 31:01.330
Fusion of the vertebral bodies.

31:01.330 --> 31:02.957
Bamboo spine.

31:02.957 --> 31:04.858
Mix with long-term chronic aches
and pains, you get?

31:07.132 --> 31:08.825
Ankylosing spondylitis.

31:08.825 --> 31:11.165
An autoimmune disease.
\h\h\hVery treatable.

31:11.165 --> 31:12.231
Ezra...

31:12.231 --> 31:14.066
the desire for perfection,

31:14.066 --> 31:16.726
\hchecking things
again and again--

31:16.726 --> 31:19.693
all your patients need that.

31:21.396 --> 31:22.957
\h\h\hLet’s go give
Blue Billy the news.

31:26.231 --> 31:27.891
It’s a manageable condition.

31:27.891 --> 31:29.495
We’ll get you set up
\hwith a specialist,

31:29.495 --> 31:31.198
\h\hand your pain will be
under control in no time.

31:31.198 --> 31:33.264
\h\h\hAnd everyone said
the pain was in my head.

31:33.264 --> 31:34.495
It’s why I took the silver.

31:34.495 --> 31:37.726
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHey. How long
before the blue fades away?

31:41.594 --> 31:43.330
Um...

31:43.330 --> 31:44.924
never.

31:44.924 --> 31:46.726
I’m sorry.

31:49.594 --> 31:52.099
\hAwesome.
(chuckles)

31:52.099 --> 31:53.429
Eh.

31:53.429 --> 31:54.726
(short chuckle)

31:54.726 --> 31:56.429
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAUSTIN:
I’ve put in hundreds of VADs,

31:56.429 --> 31:58.594
but I’ve never taken one out
\h\h\h\h\h\hfor this reason.

31:58.594 --> 31:59.957
MINA:
\hHmm.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.297
Bianca’s ventricle is clear.

32:03.297 --> 32:05.297
Now I will repair it.

32:05.297 --> 32:07.363
Pledgeted Prolene.

32:07.363 --> 32:09.297
\h\hAUSTIN:
It’s funny.

32:09.297 --> 32:12.099
The liver is the only organ
that can regenerate itself,

32:12.099 --> 32:15.099
but the heart--

32:15.099 --> 32:17.429
it can repair.

32:17.429 --> 32:19.264
Evolve.

32:19.264 --> 32:21.825
Adapt to meet its circumstances.

32:22.759 --> 32:25.627
You’re poetic today.

32:26.594 --> 32:28.231
Yeah.

32:28.231 --> 32:30.264
I guess I am.

32:31.231 --> 32:33.792
Ready to take her off bypass.

32:33.792 --> 32:36.033
Let’s see how she does
on her own, shall we?

32:45.924 --> 32:47.792
MINA:
\hHmm.

32:53.099 --> 32:55.627
Her heart is strong and healthy.

32:56.561 --> 32:58.561
All on her own.

33:02.759 --> 33:05.264
And yet another Hollywood ending

33:05.264 --> 33:07.957
to an Austin-Okafor
\h\h\hmedical story.

33:07.957 --> 33:11.594
\h\h\h\h(chuckles)
It almost wasn’t.

33:11.594 --> 33:14.165
\h\hI really thought Bianca
was gonna die on that road.

33:15.462 --> 33:18.165
\h\h\h\h\h\hShe said everything
she needed to say to her sister.

33:19.033 --> 33:20.363
She was at peace.

33:23.033 --> 33:25.099
Also, it’s an...

33:25.099 --> 33:28.528
Okafor-Austin medical story.

33:28.528 --> 33:29.924
(chuckles)

33:29.924 --> 33:31.693
Second billing.

33:31.693 --> 33:33.264
I’ll take it.

33:33.264 --> 33:34.363
This time.

33:37.759 --> 33:40.099
What would you say?

33:40.099 --> 33:43.495
You know, if you knew
it was your last hour?

33:44.462 --> 33:47.462
I don’t know what I would say.

33:47.462 --> 33:49.297
But I do know

33:49.297 --> 33:52.297
the person I would say it to...

33:52.297 --> 33:54.198
is you.

33:58.330 --> 33:59.858
(chuckles softly)

34:06.066 --> 34:08.495
Our relationship

34:08.495 --> 34:12.132
is one of the most important
\h\h\h\h\h\hones in my life.

34:13.066 --> 34:15.957
It is perfect.

34:18.528 --> 34:20.924
Just like this.

34:27.858 --> 34:30.066
Well, like I said in there,

34:30.066 --> 34:32.957
the heart can adapt.

34:35.891 --> 34:37.891
So you have a good night,

34:37.891 --> 34:39.660
Mina Okafor.

34:55.033 --> 34:56.693
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hHold on,
where are you taking her?

34:56.693 --> 34:57.858
For a quick scan.

34:57.858 --> 35:00.099
No visitors allowed.

35:00.099 --> 35:02.396
We’re not really going
\h\hfor scans, are we?

35:02.396 --> 35:04.462
Nope.

35:09.528 --> 35:10.924
\h\h\h\h\hCONRAD:
Is your car ready?

35:10.924 --> 35:13.264
I can take you to pick it up.

35:13.264 --> 35:15.429
\hOh! No, I think I’m gonna
walk out to the impound lot.

35:15.429 --> 35:17.924
It’s not too far away.

35:17.924 --> 35:20.066
I need the exercise.

35:20.066 --> 35:21.759
A little time alone
\hwith my thoughts.

35:25.594 --> 35:28.231
That was one hell of a day, hmm?

35:28.231 --> 35:30.396
You’re a hero, you know?

35:30.396 --> 35:31.924
If you hadn’t jumped in
\h\h\h\h\hto stop Archer

35:31.924 --> 35:33.429
from shooting himself,
\h\h\h\hhe’d be dead.

35:33.429 --> 35:35.099
No, man, I was supposed
\hto keep an eye on him.

35:35.099 --> 35:37.264
\hHe should never have gotten
to the gun in the first place.

35:37.264 --> 35:38.825
\h\h\h\h\h-That’s on me.
-I think you should give

35:38.825 --> 35:40.165
yourself a break.

35:41.924 --> 35:43.330
Hey,

35:43.330 --> 35:45.792
why don’t you come over
\h\hto our place later?

35:47.000 --> 35:48.759
I’m tired.

35:48.759 --> 35:50.759
-Thanks, though.
\h\h\h-Come on,

35:50.759 --> 35:52.330
we’ll order some pizza with Nic.
It’ll be fun.

35:52.330 --> 35:55.165
-I’m fine.
-You sure?

35:55.165 --> 35:56.396
I think you could use it.

35:57.792 --> 36:00.198
My ass just got fired, so...
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(chuckles)

36:00.198 --> 36:01.693
I know I could use it.

36:03.330 --> 36:06.528
Uh, not tonight.

36:08.429 --> 36:10.033
Thank you.

36:28.759 --> 36:30.462
This is the best scan
\h\hI’ve ever tasted.

36:30.462 --> 36:32.495
I guess I just had a case of...

36:32.495 --> 36:34.297
trapped-with-a-guard-itis.

36:34.297 --> 36:36.330
(laughs) They didn’t teach me
\h\h\h\h\hthat in med school.

36:36.330 --> 36:37.792
Mm.

36:37.792 --> 36:40.297
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYou know,
I wanted to be a doctor.

36:40.297 --> 36:41.462
Really?

36:41.462 --> 36:43.000
Yeah.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.825
I really liked the idea
\h\h\hof helping people.

36:45.825 --> 36:49.231
\h\h\h\h\hBut my parents
put the kibosh on that.

36:49.231 --> 36:52.726
Not a life for a princess.

36:53.660 --> 36:56.132
My life is very controlled.

36:56.132 --> 36:57.561
Look.

36:57.561 --> 36:59.231
This is the front
\hof my apartment.

36:59.231 --> 37:00.792
What do you see?

37:00.792 --> 37:02.033
That’s a camera.

37:02.033 --> 37:04.165
Over there, an alarm.

37:04.165 --> 37:06.231
And this one,

37:06.231 --> 37:07.726
another camera.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.924
The whole place is like that--

37:09.924 --> 37:13.363
alarms and cameras everywhere.

37:13.363 --> 37:16.594
(sighs) They look like they’re
\h\hthere to keep enemies out,

37:16.594 --> 37:18.033
but, really,

37:18.033 --> 37:20.957
they’re keeping princesses
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hcaged in.

37:23.231 --> 37:25.825
Well...

37:25.825 --> 37:28.000
you’re free-range now.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
(chuckles)

37:29.000 --> 37:30.858
For a short time.

37:30.858 --> 37:33.561
Thank you.

37:35.099 --> 37:37.957
I’d like to see you again.

37:37.957 --> 37:40.561
Yeah.

37:40.561 --> 37:42.858
Please.

37:45.297 --> 37:47.957
\hYou’re not gonna make
the first move, are you?

37:47.957 --> 37:50.231

Ten fingers and toes.

Excellent lungs.

Especially in the middle
\h\h\h\h\hof the night.

38:53.594 --> 38:55.132
(chuckles)

38:55.132 --> 38:57.198

38:59.792 --> 39:02.297

39:02.297 --> 39:03.627
Of course.

39:06.330 --> 39:08.099

You took good care of her.

39:10.099 --> 39:11.759
