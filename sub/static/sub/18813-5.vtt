WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:02.400
- Previously on
"Emerald City"...

00:03.240 --> 00:03.680
Come on.
We're getting you out of here.

00:03.700 --> 00:05.200
- We?
- Us.

00:05.240 --> 00:07.210
- Jack.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.200
- What have you done to me?

00:08.240 --> 00:09.310
- Saved your life, of course.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.410
- This is Lady Ev.

00:12.450 --> 00:14.390
The Princess owns you.

00:14.420 --> 00:16.390
- You ready to work?
- I don't want to forget.

00:16.420 --> 00:18.320
- Well, what do you want?
- Your magic.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.650
- Beast Forever have a brain
and a heart.

00:20.690 --> 00:22.500
If it has a heart,
you can kill it.

00:25.660 --> 00:27.430
- Sylvie?

00:27.460 --> 00:28.490
- No!

00:30.260 --> 00:32.229
- Roan?
- Stay back, all of you.

00:32.270 --> 00:33.240
- Roan!

00:33.270 --> 00:34.440
- Stay back.
- Roan!

00:34.470 --> 00:36.440
- Stop.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.730
- Dorothy, that man, he knew me.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.210
- So...

01:54.720 --> 01:59.430
Are you a good witch...

01:59.450 --> 02:03.020
or a bad witch?

02:26.080 --> 02:30.720
- Oh, I must say, The Wizard
has outdone himself.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.780
- Because he wants
something from you.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.350
- Oh, well.

02:34.390 --> 02:35.790
Cynical girl.

02:35.820 --> 02:38.790
- Cynicism is just an unpleasant
way of telling the truth.

02:48.870 --> 02:51.780
Who are you?

02:53.510 --> 02:55.350
- Jack.

02:55.380 --> 02:58.420
We met at the palace.

02:58.450 --> 03:01.490
- And how do you know
my Langwidere?

03:04.350 --> 03:06.420
- Well, I'm her...

03:06.450 --> 03:08.320
- Property.

03:08.360 --> 03:10.800
He's indentured to me
for the cost of his metal.

03:10.820 --> 03:13.790
- Oh!

03:13.830 --> 03:15.800
Oh, how sweet.

03:21.470 --> 03:25.340
- You know, you really ought to
keep your hands to yourself.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.680
- Father.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.120
- Are you all right?

03:48.160 --> 03:49.690
- Yes, my love.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.730
Yes.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.430
I brought an old friend
with me...

03:57.470 --> 04:00.100
- Ro.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.510
- It's okay, Indra.

04:02.540 --> 04:04.140
Get the girl some food.

04:04.180 --> 04:07.890
- Of course, Father.

04:08.980 --> 04:10.950
- It's okay.

04:10.980 --> 04:12.820
We'll find Dorothy soon,
I promise.

04:12.850 --> 04:13.820
- Hi.

04:13.850 --> 04:15.350
Come.

04:17.860 --> 04:18.899
- Sit down.

04:24.970 --> 04:29.740
- Why are you helping me?

04:29.770 --> 04:33.470
- Roan, you...
- I don't know who Roan is.

04:33.510 --> 04:35.880
- It's you.

04:35.910 --> 04:37.580
- A soldier?

04:37.610 --> 04:39.740
- My soldier.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.740
The best I've ever known.

04:41.780 --> 04:44.750
But you don't
remember that, do you?

04:44.790 --> 04:48.190
- All I know is,
I was found in Nimbo,

04:48.220 --> 04:49.890
left for dead
by your men.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.920
- There was an insurgency.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.730
Witchcraft.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.820
A lot of my soldiers
were killed.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.760
- Could I be responsible?

04:57.800 --> 05:00.210
Then I'd be a traitor.

05:00.230 --> 05:02.160
- You didn't kill those men.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.800
- Well, how can you be so sure?
- Because I know you.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.780
I know the man you are.

05:07.810 --> 05:09.520
And I'll prove it.

05:09.540 --> 05:11.840
I'll clear your name.

05:14.520 --> 05:15.990
- Let me come with you.

05:16.020 --> 05:17.920
- You have to stay here.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.880
Do not leave the house.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.920
If those men find you, they will
finish the job for sure.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.900
- Eamonn!
Eamonn!

05:26.930 --> 05:29.540
Oh, I need to get you help.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.960
- Stay here.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.540
That is an order.

05:32.570 --> 05:34.940
- Help!

05:43.780 --> 05:46.950
- Not much for conversation,
is she?

05:46.980 --> 05:50.580
- This is the woman
who killed your sister.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.860
I trust you will be fair.

05:52.890 --> 05:56.860
- Fair with you.
Yes.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.820
Not so much with her.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.260
- You said you would
free my wife.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.240
Nahara.

06:04.260 --> 06:07.560
From the Prison of the Abject.

06:07.600 --> 06:10.900
Can your magic do that?

06:10.940 --> 06:13.550
- My magic...

06:13.570 --> 06:17.040
can do a great
many things.

06:20.950 --> 06:24.560
Come back tomorrow
and your wife will be waiting.

06:26.090 --> 06:28.560
Mistress.

06:38.630 --> 06:39.930
- Tea!

06:47.880 --> 06:49.010
Where were we?

06:54.350 --> 06:56.320
Good witch...

06:56.350 --> 06:58.320
or bad witch?

06:58.350 --> 07:01.080
There's no wrong answer.

07:01.120 --> 07:03.820
Unfortunately,

07:03.860 --> 07:05.960
there's no right one,
either.

07:08.600 --> 07:12.000
- You're wrong
about all of this.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.560
I didn't kill your sister.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.000
- Liar!

07:16.600 --> 07:19.000
I will suck the lies
out of you

07:19.040 --> 07:20.580
like marrow from a bone,

07:20.610 --> 07:22.650
or you can speak
the truth now

07:22.680 --> 07:24.120
and save yourself the hurt.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.610
By what magic

07:26.650 --> 07:30.790
did you kill my sister?

07:30.820 --> 07:32.860
- My bag.

07:32.890 --> 07:35.790
Look in my bag.

07:43.660 --> 07:45.690
That.

07:50.970 --> 07:54.070
- What kind of
magic is this?

07:54.110 --> 07:56.080
- Magic strong enough
to kill a witch.

08:00.050 --> 08:02.050
- Huh.

08:08.860 --> 08:10.630
So this is how
you killed her.

08:13.860 --> 08:14.820
Please.

08:14.860 --> 08:16.090
- It was here.

08:16.130 --> 08:17.100
- Please.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.890
- Right here.

08:18.930 --> 08:21.200
- Please. Please.

08:21.230 --> 08:24.630
- This may come
as a surprise,

08:24.670 --> 08:28.370
but I'm not easily loved.

08:28.410 --> 08:30.080
- Please.

08:30.110 --> 08:34.610
- And you murdered the only
person who was able to.

08:52.430 --> 08:54.860
Lying to me...

08:54.900 --> 08:57.830
was a very bad idea!

09:06.180 --> 09:10.920
- I would like to
propose a toast.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.380
To my dear friend, August,

09:13.420 --> 09:14.880
the King of Ev.

09:14.920 --> 09:18.390
Welcome to the
Festival of the Beast.

09:18.430 --> 09:22.740
Where masks symbolize
unknown terror.

09:22.760 --> 09:24.960
And we celebrate the day
that I vanquished

09:25.000 --> 09:26.740
that terror from our land.

09:26.770 --> 09:29.740
But when the two moons
become one,

09:29.770 --> 09:30.930
The Beast Forever
will return,

09:30.970 --> 09:33.670
and it will be worse
than ever before.

09:35.510 --> 09:38.750
And it will obliterate
everything in its wake.

09:38.780 --> 09:41.950
But if you build us weapons,

09:41.980 --> 09:43.910
with our expert knowledge,

09:43.950 --> 09:47.420
your technological prowess...

09:53.890 --> 09:56.420
- We can...

09:56.460 --> 09:58.860
we will defeat it.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.870
- You say you have
"expert knowledge."

10:03.840 --> 10:06.910
Tell me, what expert knowledge
would this be?

10:10.910 --> 10:12.740
- Anna?

10:15.480 --> 10:18.310
- We know that this beast
will come from the sky.

10:18.350 --> 10:21.320
Where not even
the giants can reach.

10:21.350 --> 10:24.450
It will have a heart and
it will think, and it will feel,

10:24.490 --> 10:27.490
and because of that,

10:27.530 --> 10:28.970
it can be killed.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.800
- You disagree?

10:30.830 --> 10:33.500
- We both read the signs
differently.

10:33.530 --> 10:35.030
- But one reading
must be right,

10:35.070 --> 10:37.880
and the other
must be wrong.

10:37.910 --> 10:40.410
Are you the dumb one, then?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.770
- Langwidere...
- So she's the dumb one?

10:42.810 --> 10:44.040
- Child, show some respect.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.480
- I believe Anna
has misread...

10:46.510 --> 10:47.810
- Elizabeth!

10:47.850 --> 10:51.420
- No, my signs are clear.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.780
- My dear Wizard...

10:53.820 --> 10:56.820
it seems you have an abundance

10:56.860 --> 10:59.800
of expert council.

10:59.830 --> 11:01.870
The only problem is,

11:01.900 --> 11:03.840
they don't seem to agree.

11:21.050 --> 11:23.960
- What do you want?

11:23.980 --> 11:26.410
- I found our sister's killer.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.850
- Where is she?

11:31.890 --> 11:34.490
- Napping.

11:34.530 --> 11:37.040
We had a strenuous
conversation.

11:37.060 --> 11:41.560
- Don't do anything
until I arrive.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.900
- I'll do with her as I please.

11:43.940 --> 11:46.610
- And make a mess of it,
no doubt.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.450
Wait for me.

11:52.580 --> 11:53.890
Tea!

11:53.910 --> 11:54.880
- You don't have to yell,

11:54.920 --> 11:56.020
my ears haven't changed.

11:56.050 --> 11:57.890
- Were you this insolent
as a boy?

11:57.920 --> 12:00.030
- Why don't you turn me back
into one and find out?

12:00.050 --> 12:02.020
- Everybody wants to be
something they're not.

12:02.060 --> 12:03.960
Stop thinking you're
so special!

12:08.000 --> 12:09.830
What?

12:12.570 --> 12:15.470
Did I hurt your feelings?

12:15.500 --> 12:18.500
- Only the people you love
can make you angry.

12:19.940 --> 12:23.540
So angry, you want to
strangle them.

12:23.580 --> 12:27.520
Push them off a building.

12:27.550 --> 12:29.590
The ones you don't hate,
sometimes you don't

12:29.620 --> 12:31.990
really love, either.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.460
- Mistress?

12:48.500 --> 12:50.400
- Miranda,

12:50.440 --> 12:52.510
go downstairs
and see if the prisoner's awake

12:52.540 --> 12:55.050
and take the chamber pot
on your way out.

12:59.510 --> 13:01.440
No, don't mind her.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.980
- Who is she?

13:04.020 --> 13:05.420
- The old you.

14:03.680 --> 14:05.120
- Is there a river down there?

14:10.620 --> 14:11.690
- Sewer.

14:28.070 --> 14:30.440
Were you thinking
about a swim?

14:49.790 --> 14:52.600
Hey.

14:52.630 --> 14:55.570
It's me.
Sorry.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.070
Remind me to teach you

14:58.100 --> 14:59.570
the proper way

14:59.600 --> 15:03.580
to wake someone up.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.130
- Lu-cas?

15:07.570 --> 15:09.300
- Right, it's, uh...

15:09.340 --> 15:11.710
it's a name that
Dorothy calls me.

15:18.690 --> 15:21.490
- Dorothy here.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.290
- Here?

15:24.320 --> 15:26.550
Are you sure?

15:26.590 --> 15:28.320
How... how do you know?

15:41.370 --> 15:42.670
- Comfortable?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.110
Maybe you need
a good stretch?

15:59.730 --> 16:02.300
Look at me.

16:02.330 --> 16:04.670
Glinda will be
coming here tomorrow

16:04.700 --> 16:06.300
and expects information
from you.

16:06.330 --> 16:09.660
But you're going to
give it to me first.

16:09.700 --> 16:11.600
When you killed my sister...

16:11.640 --> 16:14.610
- I told you, I didn't.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.810
- She was on
her way to see me.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.670
What was she
coming to share?

16:19.710 --> 16:21.610
- I don't know.

16:21.650 --> 16:24.620
- Were you acting as someone's
agent when you murdered her?

16:24.650 --> 16:26.680
- No!

16:26.720 --> 16:28.390
- On orders?

16:28.420 --> 16:30.590
To keep her from
telling me her secrets?

16:30.620 --> 16:32.550
- No!
No, I swear.

16:32.590 --> 16:33.690
I swear.

16:33.730 --> 16:35.730
- Who is K. Chapman?

16:38.730 --> 16:40.600
- I don't know.

16:43.640 --> 16:44.910
She was my mother!

16:44.940 --> 16:46.840
- She should have taught you
how to tell the truth!

16:46.870 --> 16:49.570
- I'm not lying!
I'm not lying!

16:49.610 --> 16:51.150
I don't know her!

16:52.850 --> 16:53.920
- Your own mother?

16:56.180 --> 17:00.680
Even dogs know their bitch
from whence they came.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.690
My mother,
the Mistress of the South,

17:03.720 --> 17:05.319
birthed over
a thousand children

17:05.359 --> 17:06.660
before she died.

17:06.690 --> 17:09.589
She gave life
to every witch in Oz,

17:09.630 --> 17:13.339
and even she found
the time to care for me.

17:13.369 --> 17:15.410
Nurture me.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.740
But your mother
couldn't care less

17:18.770 --> 17:21.740
about one baby girl?

17:23.780 --> 17:26.849
How rotten do you
have to be for that?

17:26.880 --> 17:29.690
She must've sniffed it out.

17:29.720 --> 17:33.660
Something in you that's broken
and couldn't ever be fixed.

17:37.860 --> 17:39.460
- Go to hell.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.930
How did you get those?

17:58.850 --> 17:59.920
Those were hers.

18:02.920 --> 18:06.260
My sister's.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.100
- So, August, can I count on you
to build my arsenal?

18:20.500 --> 18:31.940
I'm prepared to make a very
large, very substantial offer.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.950
You'll have to
name your price.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.910
- I want my dog back.

18:39.490 --> 18:41.990
Randall.

18:42.020 --> 18:45.250
He died last year,
you know.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.690
I think it was last year.

18:54.070 --> 18:57.980
If you can bring
Randall back to me...

18:58.000 --> 18:59.930
that would be splendid.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.710
- I just had a revealing
conversation with the King.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.920
How long have you been
ruling in his stead?

19:14.950 --> 19:17.390
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.590
I'm just an insolent child.

19:19.630 --> 19:22.570
Isn't that what you said?

19:22.600 --> 19:24.440
- I need your help.

19:24.460 --> 19:26.560
You need mine.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.440
- I was too young to remember
the last attacks.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.530
But I grew up in its wake.

19:32.570 --> 19:34.400
The rebuilding of
our kingdom.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.400
- Yes, it was a marvel
of innovation.

19:36.440 --> 19:40.010
- We had no choice.

19:40.050 --> 19:41.650
When The Beast Forever came,

19:41.680 --> 19:44.950
you saved Emerald City...

19:44.980 --> 19:48.480
and left my kingdom to drown.

19:50.460 --> 19:53.470
My people to drown,
my mother...

19:56.630 --> 20:00.410
If you had thought to save us,
she'd still be alive.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.560
- It's a great tragedy.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.730
It was a great loss.

20:05.770 --> 20:08.540
- I may be the one
wearing a mask,

20:08.580 --> 20:11.750
but I can see through yours
just as clearly.

20:13.850 --> 20:15.990
- What is it that you want?

20:16.020 --> 20:18.620
Whatever it is,
it's yours.

20:18.650 --> 20:22.980
- I want to see Emerald City

20:23.020 --> 20:26.450
laid to waste.

20:26.490 --> 20:30.430
And I want to see you
drown in its suffering!

20:30.460 --> 20:33.560
And when The Beast returns,

20:33.600 --> 20:35.600
I shall have my wish.

21:01.660 --> 21:05.630
- Help me, please.

21:05.670 --> 21:07.870
She's gonna kill me.
- Yeah.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.530
As soon as she recovers.

21:11.670 --> 21:14.770
- I have to get to The Wizard.

21:14.810 --> 21:17.420
Can you give me that key?
Come on.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.870
- You don't recognize me,
do you?

21:21.710 --> 21:23.750
I was the boy you saved.

21:23.780 --> 21:27.850
From Mombi.

21:27.890 --> 21:28.890
- Tip?

21:28.920 --> 21:32.050
How?
Is that really you?

21:32.090 --> 21:34.690
- I don't know who I am
because of you.

21:34.730 --> 21:36.530
- Because of me?

21:36.560 --> 21:39.060
Tip, I... I helped you when I had
nothing to gain.

21:39.100 --> 21:42.570
And I helped you
because you asked me to.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.800
And now I'm asking you... please.

21:44.840 --> 21:47.610
Please help me.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.470
- You helping me was the worst
thing that ever happened.

21:51.510 --> 21:52.870
So now I'm gonna do for you

21:52.910 --> 21:55.640
what I wish
you'd done for me.

21:55.680 --> 21:56.880
Walk away.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.860
- No. No, Tip.
Tip.

21:58.890 --> 22:00.630
Tip.

22:00.650 --> 22:03.550
Tip.

22:03.590 --> 22:05.690
Tip, please!

22:05.730 --> 22:06.930
Tip?

22:06.960 --> 22:08.800
Tip!

22:29.280 --> 22:30.610
- Sylvie, wait.

22:34.990 --> 22:36.590
Hey, hey, hey, it's me.

22:36.620 --> 22:39.550
It's me.
It's me.

22:39.590 --> 22:40.860
It's me.

22:40.890 --> 22:42.520
Come on.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.830
Lead the way.

22:43.860 --> 22:46.760
If Dorothy's here,
we'll find her.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.540
- Listen to me, don't do this!

22:59.580 --> 23:01.590
I don't deserve to be here!

23:06.820 --> 23:10.190
- If it's any consolation,
I don't belong here, either.

23:12.790 --> 23:13.860
- Dorothy?

23:19.630 --> 23:21.760
Dorothy.

23:29.140 --> 23:31.010
- Dorothy...

23:41.950 --> 23:44.820
- How did you get here?

23:44.860 --> 23:48.030
- Same as you.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.660
- Is it really you?

23:50.700 --> 23:51.770
- Oh, Dorothy.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.940
Dorothy.

23:53.970 --> 23:55.610
It's my fault.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.810
It's my fault
you're not sure.

23:57.840 --> 24:01.050
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me most.

24:01.070 --> 24:04.070
But if you just tell this witch
what she needs to know,

24:04.110 --> 24:07.810
then we can go home.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.850
- She's gonna let us go home?

24:11.880 --> 24:13.780
- Baby, you just
have to think back.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.920
Think back to when you
killed the witch, okay?

24:15.960 --> 24:17.660
Just remember.
That's all you got to do.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.620
You just...
You got to remember.

24:23.660 --> 24:24.960
- Do you know who I am?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.840
- Witch...

24:26.870 --> 24:27.840
stern.

24:27.870 --> 24:29.870
- Merciful and stern.

24:31.740 --> 24:33.040
- Why did you come for me?
- I didn't!

24:33.070 --> 24:34.840
- Are you one of
Glinda's girls?

24:34.870 --> 24:35.970
Did she send you to hurt me?

24:36.010 --> 24:37.850
- Who?
- My sister.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.850
My sister with a secret...

24:39.880 --> 24:41.620
My sister with a secret.

24:43.650 --> 24:44.980
Glinda.

24:47.750 --> 24:50.920
She was trying to
tell me about Glinda.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.000
- Mom?

25:00.100 --> 25:02.910
- Thanks for the memories.

25:18.890 --> 25:21.930
- Hurry up. We're going to
miss the festival.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.060
I said hurry up.

25:27.090 --> 25:30.060
- Why should I do
anything you say?

25:30.100 --> 25:32.040
- Because I'm a princess.

25:32.060 --> 25:35.430
- You're the worst human being
I've ever met.

25:35.470 --> 25:36.970
What am I even doing here?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.730
You obviously hate me
and now you want me to, what?

25:39.770 --> 25:40.900
Eat candy apples with you?

25:40.940 --> 25:44.440
Or am I supposed to trail behind
you like some kind of pet?

25:44.480 --> 25:47.750
Or maybe I'm here
to entertain you,

25:47.780 --> 25:50.010
so you can laugh at my
clumsiness, my freakishness,

25:50.050 --> 25:51.920
is that it?

25:51.950 --> 25:54.950
What do you want from me?

25:57.790 --> 26:00.050
- You're my friend.

26:05.870 --> 26:06.970
- Why are you laughing?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.810
- Do you even know
what a friend is?

26:08.840 --> 26:09.870
- Of course I do.

26:09.900 --> 26:14.140
- Have you ever
had one before?

26:14.170 --> 26:18.010
- I've always wanted
a friend, I just...

26:18.040 --> 26:21.010
didn't know
where to get one.

26:21.050 --> 26:22.320
- No, you don't...

26:22.350 --> 26:26.760
"get" one,
you earn one.

26:27.790 --> 26:30.130
- How?

26:30.160 --> 26:33.870
- I don't know, by thinking of
them before yourself.

26:33.890 --> 26:37.020
Trying to be helpful,
encouraging,

26:37.060 --> 26:39.090
or just...

26:39.130 --> 26:42.930
doing things together.

26:54.810 --> 26:56.510
- Like going to a festival?

26:58.920 --> 27:00.990
- I guess.

27:05.020 --> 27:06.850
- So...

27:11.560 --> 27:14.800
- This one girl
felled my best soldier.

27:16.570 --> 27:19.810
- I don't know what kind of
power she used.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.810
But one moment I was up,

27:21.840 --> 27:22.940
and the next, down.

27:22.980 --> 27:25.120
- It was this.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.110
- Do you know what it is?

27:53.410 --> 27:55.080
- I think this is yours.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.910
- Why are you helping me?

27:59.950 --> 28:02.920
- I'm already responsible
for one person dying.

28:02.950 --> 28:05.160
I don't want to be
responsible for another.

28:05.180 --> 28:08.180
- Thank you.
Thank you.

28:09.960 --> 28:11.360
We have to hurry.

28:16.160 --> 28:18.960
- Our Mistress will be
so pleased with me.

28:40.420 --> 28:42.260
- Where's your mistress?

28:44.290 --> 28:46.350
How long have you had her?

28:46.390 --> 28:48.120
- Less than a day.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.160
But she's been
quite revealing.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.400
- I told you to wait for me.
- Oh, don't worry.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.860
I'm certain she has
more secrets to spill.

28:54.900 --> 28:55.860
- Secrets?

28:55.900 --> 28:57.360
- The ones our sister
died with.

28:57.400 --> 29:01.440
- If secrets were kept,
they were kept from me, too.

29:01.470 --> 29:03.470
- And what of your own?

29:03.510 --> 29:06.220
- I harbor no secrets.

29:06.250 --> 29:08.420
Especially from you.

29:08.450 --> 29:11.260
You're the only family
I have left.

29:12.950 --> 29:16.220
I hadn't seen
our Eastern sister in years

29:16.260 --> 29:18.660
and now she's gone.

29:18.690 --> 29:22.660
Let time not be
our enemy, as well.

29:22.690 --> 29:25.660
- You hadn't seen her
in years?

29:27.370 --> 29:28.510
- Why?

29:28.530 --> 29:32.500
Did the girl tell you
differently?

29:32.540 --> 29:34.950
- The girl said
all kinds of things.

29:41.210 --> 29:42.480
Mistress!

29:42.510 --> 29:44.250
The prisoner!
- Where is she?

29:44.280 --> 29:46.310
- Escaped!

29:46.350 --> 29:49.320
- You couldn't have listened
to me this one time?

29:49.360 --> 29:51.430
- I will find her!

29:51.460 --> 29:54.670
- Your incompetence
has cost me enough.

29:56.300 --> 29:58.370
I tried to stop them,
but they overpowered me.

29:58.400 --> 30:01.040
- Who is "they"?

30:01.070 --> 30:03.980
- Her!

30:04.000 --> 30:06.930
- Where is the girl?
- Ma'am?

30:06.970 --> 30:09.470
- Tell her what you did.
- What I did?

30:09.510 --> 30:12.420
- I walked in on her
helping the prisoner!

30:12.440 --> 30:15.480
They ran at me
and slammed the grate on me!

30:15.510 --> 30:17.480
- Is this true?

30:17.520 --> 30:19.720
- Ma'am, I've been preparing
your tea all morning,

30:19.750 --> 30:20.710
just like you asked.

30:20.750 --> 30:22.050
- Liar!

30:22.090 --> 30:23.360
She's lying!

30:29.300 --> 30:31.070
- Did you...

30:31.100 --> 30:34.510
help the girl out of spite?

30:34.530 --> 30:37.360
Hmm?

30:37.400 --> 30:40.430
To hurt your mistress?

30:40.470 --> 30:42.000
As much as she hurt you?

30:42.040 --> 30:45.440
- No, Mistress,
I would never.

30:45.480 --> 30:47.380
She did it all.

30:47.410 --> 30:50.380
Look into her soul
and you'll see.

31:04.300 --> 31:08.770
- If there's one thing
I cannot stand...

31:12.470 --> 31:14.000
It's a liar!

31:41.430 --> 31:43.430
- I'm sorry
about your father.

31:43.470 --> 31:44.510
Him being sick.

31:44.540 --> 31:46.410
- He's not sick.

31:46.440 --> 31:49.150
He's simply leaving us...

31:49.180 --> 31:51.480
without leaving us.

31:57.380 --> 31:59.450
So this is what it's like
to feel normal.

32:01.150 --> 32:03.380
- Can I ask you something?

32:03.420 --> 32:06.450
- Why do I wear a mask?

32:08.160 --> 32:11.330
I'll tell you
when we're friends.

32:35.850 --> 32:39.090
- I have something
to show you.

32:42.430 --> 32:44.740
- What is it?

32:44.760 --> 32:48.560
- It's a bullet;
more powerful than magic.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.870
Something so powerful...

32:52.900 --> 32:55.640
that it can kill
The Beast Forever.

32:59.410 --> 33:02.510
And then we'll really have
something to celebrate.

33:13.830 --> 33:16.130
- And from the belly
of The Beast

33:16.160 --> 33:17.820
came The Serpent.

33:17.860 --> 33:22.230
From the deepest, coldest,
darkest part of the...

33:39.850 --> 33:41.750
- Run!

34:05.480 --> 34:06.950
- Why do you hunt me?

34:06.980 --> 34:07.950
Why do you hunt me?

34:07.980 --> 34:10.190
- Nimbo!
- Why?

34:10.219 --> 34:11.760
- I can't...
- Tell me!

34:11.780 --> 34:13.880
- There was a wagon
you drove, all right?

34:13.920 --> 34:17.190
We pulled you over
and you drew your sword.

34:17.219 --> 34:18.750
- Why?

34:18.790 --> 34:21.190
- I tried to see
what was inside.

34:21.230 --> 34:22.570
But you wouldn't allow it.

34:22.590 --> 34:25.530
Then you came at us,
sword drawn.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.560
Ten men, you killed.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.239
Cut them down
like they were nothing.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.199
- No.
- Yes.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.580
If you don't believe me,
look on your left side.

34:35.610 --> 34:36.949
All right? That's where
I stabbed you

34:36.980 --> 34:38.880
before you went down.

35:06.870 --> 35:08.900
- I've done some bad things
and now I have to

35:08.940 --> 35:09.900
answer for them.

35:13.040 --> 35:16.510
I don't want to hurt you too.

35:16.550 --> 35:18.920
I need you to promise me:

35:18.950 --> 35:20.650
no magic.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.650
No magic.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.250
Promise me.

35:39.710 --> 35:41.710
- Jack.

35:50.750 --> 35:52.590
- Excuse me, sweetheart.

35:52.620 --> 35:54.490
But that's a pretty mask, huh?

35:54.520 --> 35:56.450
I wonder whether there's
a pretty face behind it.

35:56.490 --> 35:58.030
Or an ugly one?

35:58.060 --> 36:00.030
I mean, uh, how about
we take a look?

36:00.060 --> 36:01.570
- Leave her alone!

36:06.030 --> 36:08.600
I think we got
a hero over here, hmm?

36:08.630 --> 36:10.600
You really want to be a hero?

36:10.640 --> 36:12.480
Well, you're gonna have to try
a little bit harder than that.

36:12.500 --> 36:13.600
Eh?
Huh?

36:13.640 --> 36:15.550
- Let go of me!

36:17.480 --> 36:19.650
Leave him alone this instant!

36:21.610 --> 36:23.610
Stop it!

36:23.650 --> 36:26.020
I command you!
- Ooh, she commands me.

36:27.490 --> 36:30.030
Stop! Please.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.790
- You're going to kill him!

37:02.720 --> 37:03.820
Are you okay?

37:08.530 --> 37:09.670
You're scared of me.

37:11.700 --> 37:13.770
Then why are you
looking at me like that?

37:38.660 --> 37:42.600
- What?

37:42.630 --> 37:44.600
- Friends don't do that.

37:46.830 --> 37:51.470
- Then let's be
something else.

37:56.740 --> 37:59.840
- Are you certain this is
the day my sister died?

37:59.880 --> 38:01.590
- Yes, Mistress.

38:03.650 --> 38:04.790
Would you like to see more?

38:04.820 --> 38:06.460
- No.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.580
I've seen enough!

38:17.830 --> 38:20.870
- Roan.

38:20.900 --> 38:21.910
Release him!

38:21.930 --> 38:25.630
- No.

38:25.670 --> 38:28.670
Your men were
right about me.

38:28.710 --> 38:30.510
I killed them.

38:30.540 --> 38:31.610
All of them.

38:37.750 --> 38:39.490
- Mistress.
- Not now!

38:39.520 --> 38:40.960
- You said tomorrow.

38:40.990 --> 38:41.960
Tomorrow is here.

38:41.990 --> 38:43.560
Nahara is not.

38:43.590 --> 38:46.630
- Much has happened
since we spoke.

38:48.930 --> 38:51.600
- You promised to release her.

38:51.630 --> 38:52.790
- I lied.

38:54.870 --> 38:56.810
Everybody lies!

40:16.980 --> 40:18.880
- Breathe

40:18.920 --> 40:21.690
Breathe in the air

40:24.990 --> 40:28.820
Don't be afraid to care

40:31.900 --> 40:33.640
Leave

40:33.670 --> 40:36.670
But don't leave me

40:38.740 --> 40:41.610
Look around

40:41.640 --> 40:43.870
Choose your own ground

40:46.380 --> 40:47.750
Long you live

40:47.780 --> 40:49.750
And high you fly

40:49.780 --> 40:51.610
And smiles you'll give

40:51.650 --> 40:53.750
And tears you'll cry

40:53.790 --> 40:55.330
And all you touch

40:55.350 --> 40:57.580
And all you see

40:57.620 --> 40:59.020
Is all your life

40:59.060 --> 41:01.830
Will ever be

41:01.860 --> 41:03.890
Run

41:03.930 --> 41:06.640
Rabbit run

41:08.700 --> 41:10.960
Dig that hole

41:11.000 --> 41:14.900
Forget the sun

41:21.710 --> 41:23.840
- Pink Floyd?

41:25.820 --> 41:27.790
- How did you know that?

41:27.820 --> 41:30.660
- We both come from
the same place, don't we?

41:31.820 --> 41:33.750
- Are you here to kill me?

41:37.900 --> 41:41.770
- Do you know my mother,
Karen Chapman?

41:41.800 --> 41:45.400
- What?

41:45.440 --> 41:46.410
Dorothy?

41:47.710 --> 41:50.680
Oh, my God.

41:50.710 --> 41:52.350
Dorothy, you've come home.
