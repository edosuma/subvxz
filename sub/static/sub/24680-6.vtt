In New York City's war on crime,

00:09.988 --> 00:13.077
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:13.077 --> 00:15.003
of the Major Case Squad.

00:15.003 --> 00:17.067
These are their stories.

00:25.538 --> 00:27.038
It's all good.

00:27.038 --> 00:29.418
The joint's goin' down.

00:30.716 --> 00:32.463
It's gonna be blazin'.

00:38.507 --> 00:40.928
Feels right. Weight's good.

00:42.858 --> 00:44.219
I don't know about this.

00:44.219 --> 00:47.243
Just do like I said,
and everything will be cool.

Yo, who's he?

01:03.360 --> 01:04.277
He's my cousin.

01:04.277 --> 01:06.118
He's frontin' me the jack.

01:07.954 --> 01:10.243
We got ours. What you got?

01:17.022 --> 01:18.959
All right.

01:29.027 --> 01:31.139
We takin'a tour of Staten Island or what?

01:31.139 --> 01:32.439
You eatin' all my gas.

01:32.439 --> 01:34.454
Just a little more ways out.

01:39.872 --> 01:41.408
Yo, who's that?

01:42.697 --> 01:43.796
You got somebody on us?

01:43.796 --> 01:47.098
What are you talkin' about?
You need to chill out.

01:47.098 --> 01:49.627
I just don't like cars riding on my ass.

01:54.373 --> 01:57.248
There. They're gone.

01:59.125 --> 02:02.489
Okay, up there.
That rest stop.

02:13.354 --> 02:15.700
We lost 'em. Damn!

02:15.700 --> 02:19.661
They couldn't have got that far away.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.233
Now, hold up. Hold up.

02:21.233 --> 02:22.988
I saw a car in that rest stop.

02:33.562 --> 02:34.925
You see anything?

02:36.078 --> 02:37.794
No.

02:53.025 --> 02:54.863
Oh, God.

02:57.487 --> 02:59.579
1013! 1013!
Officers down!

02:59.579 --> 03:01.423

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2003/11/02

03:51.255 --> 03:54.253
My detectives, Gilman...
he was driving... and Lewis,

03:54.253 --> 03:56.686
they were undercover, 
doing a gun buy from the two punks.

03:56.686 --> 03:58.418
Where were their backups?

03:58.418 --> 04:01.014
They had to back off.
They thought they were being made.

04:01.014 --> 04:04.500
By the time they caught up,
this is what they found.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.423
But they had on a wire. They could 
hear what was going on in the car.

04:07.423 --> 04:09.216
The wire cut out.

04:09.216 --> 04:12.680
The equipment...
The reception's for crap out here.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.994
We're sorry about your guys.
How much was the buy money?

04:15.994 --> 04:19.060
Thirty-five hundred in marked bills.

04:19.060 --> 04:21.668
For five plastic guns.

04:21.668 --> 04:23.939
Yeah. We got set up.

04:23.939 --> 04:26.781
They had one or more accomplices 
waiting here to ambush us.

04:26.781 --> 04:30.707
They took the dough and scrammed,
probably through those woods.

04:30.707 --> 04:32.199
We're checking the bridges and ferries.

04:32.199 --> 04:33.742
We'll need to talk to the backups.

04:33.742 --> 04:36.143
They're pretty shook-up.

04:36.143 --> 04:39.456
Well, we'll make it quick.

04:39.456 --> 04:41.841
Paint job,
the attention to detail.

04:41.841 --> 04:43.720
Got a real weight to it.

04:46.089 --> 04:48.943
These are L.E.D. Light bolts.

04:48.943 --> 04:53.942
They use 'em on custom cars to jazz up 
license plates, engine compartments.

04:53.942 --> 04:58.643
- Detective... Price?
- Yes / - Williams.

04:58.643 --> 05:00.976
I'm Robert Goren.
This is Detective Bishop.

05:00.976 --> 05:02.517
We're sorry about your partners.

05:02.517 --> 05:07.964
- We just have a couple of questions...
- We heard that they had a family, kids?

05:07.964 --> 05:12.003
Yeah. Gilman had a boy,
and Lewis had two girls.

05:12.003 --> 05:16.216
Okay. We'll keep that in mind.

05:17.825 --> 05:19.370
How'd you hook up with the punks?

05:19.370 --> 05:22.392
Gilman put the word out he was 
in the market for firepower.

05:22.392 --> 05:26.180
Those two punks come up to him,
sold him a.38 S&W.

05:26.180 --> 05:27.999
They said they had five more pieces to sell.

05:27.999 --> 05:29.388
They wanted six grand.

05:29.388 --> 05:31.424
Gilman said he needed a day 
to get the money up.

05:31.424 --> 05:33.803
The punks said, "No,
the deal has to go down right now."

05:33.803 --> 05:37.595
So they came back with 3,500,
bottom price. We jumped on it.

05:37.595 --> 05:39.623
We didn't even know who these guys were.

05:39.623 --> 05:43.897
- All we had were their street names.
- Looks like Lewis was shot first.

05:43.897 --> 05:48.860
He and Gilman were turned towards 
the backseat, negotiating the deal.

05:48.860 --> 05:51.491
Single bullet,
point blank to the back of the head.

05:51.491 --> 05:53.076
The shot came from outside.

05:53.076 --> 05:57.220
- Could I get a close-up of, uh, his hands?
- Why? What do you see?

05:57.220 --> 06:03.088
I don't know. Just some interesting 
ulcerations on his knuckles and finger webs.

06:03.088 --> 06:07.728
- He carries a backup piece?
- Yeah, a.22 caliber.

06:07.728 --> 06:11.923
- Well, someone kept a souvenir.
- Over here.

06:12.694 --> 06:15.056
We have a single set of tracks
leading into the woods.

06:15.056 --> 06:17.724
There's another road about a half mile through there.

06:20.894 --> 06:24.519
Oh, toe, knee prints.

06:24.519 --> 06:28.044
This is where he was waiting.

06:28.044 --> 06:30.984
There's no pacing,

06:30.984 --> 06:35.795
no cigarette butts.

06:37.165 --> 06:39.169
He was concentrated on this.

06:39.169 --> 06:42.715
He drew it with his finger 
over and over again.

06:42.715 --> 06:45.396
They found a witness who was 
on a secondary road last night.

06:45.396 --> 06:48.044
Said he saw a male black come
out of the woods with a bicycle.

06:48.044 --> 06:50.684
Now we know how he made his getaway.

06:53.057 --> 06:55.735
Well, can we go?

06:55.735 --> 06:59.153
There was no moon last night.

06:59.153 --> 07:03.230
No light. Underbrush.
Even with a flashlight,

07:03.230 --> 07:06.688
how did this guy find his way 
back to the other road?

07:06.688 --> 07:08.941
After you, Detective.

07:12.861 --> 07:16.906
We got a pop on the prints of one 
of the dead perps, Darren Exree.

07:16.906 --> 07:20.003
Lived with his uncle.
Uncle doesn't know anything about it.

07:20.003 --> 07:23.894
We're still trying to chase down Darren's friends, 
but no one's admitting to knowing him.

07:23.894 --> 07:26.101
Nobody wants to get too close to a cop killing.

07:26.101 --> 07:29.063
Ballistics confirmed the same gun killed 
Detective Lewis and the kid sitting behind him.

07:29.063 --> 07:32.270
A nine mil. Latent checked 
the casings. No prints.

07:32.270 --> 07:35.254
Thanks. Do you mind leaving it on my desk?

07:36.966 --> 07:40.739
- She doesn't wanna get left in his dust.
- I like her hustle.

07:40.739 --> 07:44.271
- You're supposed to be on leave.
- With two dead cops?

07:46.327 --> 07:48.121
This is the rest stop.

07:48.121 --> 07:51.821
This is where the suspect was seen 
coming out of the woods with his bicycle.

07:51.821 --> 07:56.869
According to the tracks that he left,
he got from here to there.

07:56.869 --> 08:00.459
But there was no marked trail, no path.

08:00.459 --> 08:05.702
But he found his way through the woods,
underbrush, gullies, all in the dark.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.765
Just the stars to guide him.

08:07.765 --> 08:12.556
He, uh, drew it in the ground 
while waiting for the ambush.

08:12.556 --> 08:21.387
It's a... a memory guide, uh, to orient 
himself in, uh...in-in three dimensions.

08:21.387 --> 08:23.975
It's interesting how his mind works.

08:23.975 --> 08:26.222
We'll give him a merit badge 
when we find him.

08:26.222 --> 08:27.600
Anything on surveillance tape?

08:27.600 --> 08:30.582
It was mostly inaudible.
The sound kept dropping off.

08:30.582 --> 08:31.913
There was one thing.

08:31.913 --> 08:33.650
Yo. Who's that?

08:33.650 --> 08:34.731
You got somebody on us?

08:34.731 --> 08:39.150
What are you talking about?
You need to chill out.

08:39.150 --> 08:41.206
I just don't like cars riding on my ass.

08:42.986 --> 08:46.241
- The cough.
- The dead perp we haven't identified.

08:46.241 --> 08:50.149
This might explain the cough.
It's the labs on his hands.

08:50.149 --> 08:54.794
"Hexamethylene diisocyanates,acetate,
chromium traces throughout the body,

08:54.794 --> 08:58.504
with higher concentrations in the lungs."

09:00.550 --> 09:03.496
These are chemicals found in auto paint.

09:06.194 --> 09:10.773
The ulceration on his hands 
are chrome holes.

09:10.773 --> 09:13.854
Then the kid worked in a custom auto shop.

09:13.854 --> 09:16.783
How many of those can there be 
in Staten Island?

09:26.544 --> 09:29.533
I told you I'd get you out.

09:29.533 --> 09:31.288
Took you long enough, baby.

09:31.288 --> 09:32.790
They were about to send me upstate.

09:32.790 --> 09:36.418
I got something for you.

09:39.511 --> 09:43.673
Check this.
This you'll like even better.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.514
No, no. Not here, all right?
I gotta show you how to use it,

09:47.514 --> 09:50.726
then we're ready.

09:50.726 --> 09:53.850
You always think of everything, baby.

09:53.850 --> 09:58.455
Well, just you.
I just think of you.

10:00.858 --> 10:03.862
DIXON'S CUSTOM AUTO
STATEN ISLAND, NEW YORK
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 4

10:03.862 --> 10:05.952
Yeah. That's Levon.
Levon Marcus.

10:05.952 --> 10:10.117
He started working for me last December.
I didn't see this coming at all.

10:10.117 --> 10:13.415
- How about his friends? 
Do you know this guy? / - No.

10:13.415 --> 10:15.639
- We'll need a home address.
- He moved last month.

10:15.639 --> 10:19.293
I was supposed to redo his paperwork.
We got busy,

10:19.293 --> 10:20.610
and... and I never got around to it.

10:20.610 --> 10:22.526
Then we'll take the old address.

10:22.526 --> 10:24.966
I think I threw it away.

10:28.846 --> 10:32.914
You know, when Levon used your paint booth,
he... he always wore this gear?

10:32.914 --> 10:35.399
Oh, all my people do.
I don't like paying fines.

10:35.399 --> 10:38.690
Because he had a really bad cough.
I'm sure you noticed it.

10:38.690 --> 10:43.280
I mean, the autopsy found...
What was it that was in his lungs?

10:43.280 --> 10:49.243
Diisocyanates, acetate and chromium 
in high concentrations.

10:49.243 --> 10:52.957
And he was only here for six months.

10:52.957 --> 10:58.133
He was always wearing his gear.
So how'd he get so messed up?

10:58.133 --> 11:02.187
I mean, it was like he was 
breathing fumes day and night.

11:02.187 --> 11:04.225
I don't know. I'm no doctor.

11:04.225 --> 11:07.910
What's that up there?
A sleeping bag?

11:11.185 --> 11:16.980
He said he needed the extra money,
and I needed a security guard.

11:16.980 --> 11:20.520
If Levon slept here,
who slept there?

11:20.520 --> 11:25.444
I don't know. I told Levon 
he couldn't have anybody up here.

11:25.444 --> 11:28.373
This must be where they doctored up the guns.

11:31.868 --> 11:35.872
- Levon good with his hands?
- No, he's got 10 thumbs.

11:35.872 --> 11:38.459
So the houseguest did the guns.

11:49.440 --> 11:53.303
He used this to shape a piece of metal.

11:57.202 --> 12:00.150
Make a tool.

12:00.150 --> 12:01.821
Put a lot of work into it.

12:01.821 --> 12:03.280
He didn't use it in the ambush.

12:03.280 --> 12:07.154
Maybe the killings were the first step.

12:07.154 --> 12:10.610
He's got something else in the works.

12:12.640 --> 12:15.871
There were prints from a dozen individuals 
in the attic, none of which popped,

12:15.871 --> 12:19.926
and no usable prints 
on the spray can or the tape.

12:19.926 --> 12:21.342
That's not good enough.

12:21.342 --> 12:23.391
This cop killer did not just fall 
from the sky.

12:23.391 --> 12:27.317
Somebody knows him.
What do you got for me?

12:27.317 --> 12:32.806
I'm not sure. The lab made it up using 
the form that was nailed to the attic floor.

12:32.806 --> 12:36.388
Our missing man,
he made one just like it.

12:36.388 --> 12:38.521
Don't spend all day on it.

12:41.440 --> 12:45.335
I'm pretty sure that this is a handle.

12:45.335 --> 12:49.654
The rest of it...
a burglary tool.

12:49.654 --> 12:53.700
Some kind of Slim Jim for a car door.

12:53.700 --> 12:58.371
Or maybe like this. Slide up a window
frame. Pop open a latch.

12:58.371 --> 13:01.056
But you'd have to snake that end between 
the window and the frame...

13:01.056 --> 13:05.521
before you could slide it up.
It'd never go in.

13:05.521 --> 13:07.655
You're right.

13:07.655 --> 13:13.515
The window would have to be open...
for this to be set into place.

13:13.515 --> 13:20.326
A man rigging it on the inside for someone 
on the outside to use later.

13:20.326 --> 13:22.412
You'd need two people.

13:22.412 --> 13:27.230
But if the killer had an accomplice,
why not use him on the ambush?

13:27.230 --> 13:29.622
Maybe he wasn't available.

13:29.622 --> 13:33.820
The punks insisted on bottom price.

13:33.820 --> 13:35.742
Thirty-five hundred bucks.

13:35.742 --> 13:39.953
You know, I have an idea where 
we can find those marked bills.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.001
NEW YORK COUNTY
CLERK'S OFFICE
QUEENS, NEW YORK
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9

13:42.001 --> 13:45.548
I'm not surprised you found marked 
bills coming out of our office,

13:45.548 --> 13:49.587
with all the bail and fines 
we collect from drug cases.

13:49.587 --> 13:51.966
Happy hunting.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.105
If I'm not scrolling fast enough, be my
guest. / I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

14:00.105 --> 14:02.939
No, really, I don't mind.
Eames likes to drive, so she drives.

14:02.939 --> 14:09.647
- You wanna scroll, scroll.
- Thank you, no.

14:09.647 --> 14:15.699
Here's one. A $3,500 fine for shoplifting
from a pharmacy in Queens.

14:15.699 --> 14:20.676
"Tamara Bates, 19.
Spent four days in Rikers."

14:20.676 --> 14:22.310
The fine was paid the day after the killings.

14:22.310 --> 14:26.753
The gun from the ankle holster,
it was a.22. A lady's gun.

14:26.753 --> 14:29.645
Nice coming-home present.

14:29.645 --> 14:33.419
Home being her grandmother's in Brooklyn.

14:33.419 --> 14:36.258
I didn't even know Tamara was arrested.

14:36.258 --> 14:38.935
- I haven't seen her since Sunday.
- You weren't worried?

14:38.935 --> 14:41.599
I work nights over at St. Mary's.

14:41.599 --> 14:43.896
She's always gone 
by the time I get home.

14:43.896 --> 14:46.023
Do you know Tamara's boyfriend?

14:46.023 --> 14:50.404
Who says she has a boyfriend?

14:50.404 --> 14:52.274
Uh, this does.

14:52.274 --> 14:54.920
If Tamara's in trouble,
you tell me now.

14:54.920 --> 14:58.044
It's possible she's gotten involved 
with a very dangerous man.

14:58.044 --> 15:00.786
It's important we find her 
before she gets hurt.

15:00.786 --> 15:03.038
This always happens to her.

15:03.038 --> 15:04.710
These men she picks...

15:04.710 --> 15:06.269
What about them?

15:06.269 --> 15:11.836
They beat her.
She keeps going back, just like her mother.

15:11.836 --> 15:13.972
Fingertip moistener.

15:16.971 --> 15:20.677
She bought it last week.
Do you have any idea why she uses this?

15:20.677 --> 15:24.489
She counts money 
at a check cashing store on Myrtle.

15:24.489 --> 15:26.318
She tries to be good.

15:26.318 --> 15:31.034
She gives me $50 a week for rent and groceries.

15:31.034 --> 15:33.107
SMOKEY'S CHECK CASHING
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 9

15:33.107 --> 15:34.359
I fired her three months ago.

15:34.359 --> 15:37.029
She kept running up my phone bill,
calling an old boyfriend in Pennsylvania.

15:37.029 --> 15:40.040
- What about a current boyfriend?
- What am I, PageSix?

15:40.040 --> 15:43.670
- We'll take the Pennsylvania number.
- I'll check my records.

15:44.715 --> 15:47.625
So she's still paying her rent.

15:47.625 --> 15:51.920
She's still using fingertip moistener.
She's still counting money for a living,

15:51.920 --> 15:54.511
but not anyplace that she wants 
her grandmother to know.

15:54.511 --> 15:58.515
- A bookie.
- Or worse.

16:19.025 --> 16:20.710
You're late.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.243
A fire on the subway.

16:22.243 --> 16:25.037
Where you been?
I paged you all week.

16:25.037 --> 16:29.394
I was sick. In my stomach.
What?

16:29.394 --> 16:31.958
You want a note from the clinic?

16:31.958 --> 16:34.835
I have to use the washroom.

17:29.639 --> 17:32.600
This was a bank for one of 
our local drug entrepreneurs.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.606
Typically, there's 300 or 400K.

17:35.606 --> 17:37.880
What's your interest here?
Did you know these victims?

17:37.880 --> 17:41.041
We might know the perps.

17:41.041 --> 17:44.339
- Twenty-two.
- Yeah.

17:44.339 --> 17:46.757
It doesn't match any of 
the weaponry in here.

17:46.757 --> 17:50.125
Do you know this girl, Tamara Bates?
She's a counter.

17:50.125 --> 17:53.131
It doesn't ring any bells.
These places go through a lot of girls.

17:53.131 --> 17:54.746
I can see how.

17:54.746 --> 17:56.654
- How'd the perps get in?
- Don't know,

17:56.654 --> 18:00.187
but I can tell you how they got out.

18:00.187 --> 18:02.213
The fire escape's right out there.

18:31.785 --> 18:34.203
It's a perfect fit.

18:34.203 --> 18:39.168
So were Bonnie and Clyde.
They killed 10 people.

18:39.168 --> 18:42.003
These two are up to nine.

18:49.928 --> 18:52.476
It's rusted shut.

18:52.476 --> 18:56.233
They had to jump.

18:56.233 --> 18:58.482
These scuff marks...

19:00.983 --> 19:02.494
Someone took a tumble.

19:02.494 --> 19:05.420
Utica Avenue.
There's a subway station a block over.

19:05.420 --> 19:07.678
We'll get you photos of the girl 
to show around.

19:07.678 --> 19:12.120
One of them might be limping,
probably the girl.

19:12.120 --> 19:13.130
These friends of yours?

19:13.130 --> 19:16.249
- It's their money got stolen.
- I just wanna talk to you!

19:16.249 --> 19:20.270
Look, we gotta have an understanding.
The people that did this,

19:20.270 --> 19:24.363
they belong to us.
They're ours.

19:24.363 --> 19:31.163
If you have any questions or information,
you just call me.

19:34.105 --> 19:35.766
A subway clerk made Tamara.

19:35.766 --> 19:40.019
She was limping hard, getting help from 
a male, black, in his 20s.

19:40.019 --> 19:41.697
The clerk didn't see which train they took.

19:41.697 --> 19:47.619
We have her photos out to the bus stations, 
Amtrak, airports, car rentals.

19:47.619 --> 19:49.843
Assuming they're smart,
they'd be laying low.

19:49.843 --> 19:51.281
They don't have a lot of options.

19:51.281 --> 19:54.415
The boyfriend was sneaking 
into the grandmother's place to sleep.

19:54.415 --> 19:58.342
He bunked in the car shop.
He's a stray. He's homeless.

19:58.342 --> 20:00.708
We have a unit sitting on 
her grandmother's place.

20:00.708 --> 20:03.230
There's an ex-boyfriend in Pennsylvania

20:03.230 --> 20:06.108
who says he hasn't heard from her 
in three months.

20:06.108 --> 20:08.717
He didn't sound too heartbroken.

20:08.717 --> 20:12.017
Here's another boyfriend she might reach 
out to... Eugene Thomas.

20:12.017 --> 20:15.910
Tamara, uh, filed an assault complaint 
against him last year.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.208
She dropped it the next day.

20:18.208 --> 20:23.588
Eugene works for a private 
ambulance company.

20:23.588 --> 20:26.860
Tamara's ankle's gotta be hurtin' pretty 
good by now.

20:26.860 --> 20:29.923
They wouldn't risk a hospital.

20:29.923 --> 20:31.869
When's the last time you saw Tamara?

20:31.869 --> 20:33.702
Geez, you guys.

20:36.429 --> 20:39.896
About six months ago,
at a club.

20:39.896 --> 20:43.251
I bought her a drink.
I went on my merry way.

20:43.251 --> 20:47.337
Oh, so the two of you are on merry terms?

20:47.337 --> 20:49.115
Bygones are bygones.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.695
Your dispatcher

20:51.695 --> 20:55.117
said that you were...

20:59.226 --> 21:01.602
Do... Do you wanna meet her?
Because I'm sure...

21:01.602 --> 21:04.862
she'd love to meet someone 
in the medical profession.

21:04.862 --> 21:08.592
- Wh-What are you goin' in my bag for?
- Because I can.

21:08.592 --> 21:10.733
You're low on ACE bandages.

21:12.716 --> 21:15.906
Only one vial of solumedrol?

21:15.906 --> 21:18.638
One of fentanyl, one of morphine.

21:18.638 --> 21:22.021
Isn't standard issue two vials of each?

21:22.021 --> 21:23.607
Who's that guy she's with?

21:23.607 --> 21:25.629
That's Manny Oliverez.

21:25.629 --> 21:27.848
He's an interested party.

21:27.848 --> 21:29.632
But he keeps looking at me.

21:29.632 --> 21:30.934
What's his problem?

21:30.934 --> 21:36.912
Well, his problem is that he's 
a drug dealer, he's short 400,000.

21:36.912 --> 21:38.656
Tamara stole it from him.

21:38.656 --> 21:40.227
What's that got to do with me?

21:40.227 --> 21:43.856
Well, someone told him 
that you were her friend...

21:43.856 --> 21:45.960
and that you might know where she is.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.919
Where the hell did he hear that from?

21:47.919 --> 21:56.031
You know, uh,
you can tell us what you know now,

21:56.031 --> 22:03.472
or y-you can deal with him later.

22:03.472 --> 22:08.229
Okay, look...
But I cannot lose my job over this.

22:08.229 --> 22:10.255
Look, I was just trying to help the bitch.

22:10.255 --> 22:12.887
She called me.
She said she was hurt.

22:12.887 --> 22:14.008
And where was she?

22:14.008 --> 22:17.146
At the Gateway Inn near LaGuardia.

22:17.146 --> 22:19.887
Look, l-I wasn't gonna try to take any money.

22:19.887 --> 22:22.436
I figured she could pay me 
some other way. You dig?

22:22.436 --> 22:24.066
But she pulled a gun on me,

22:24.066 --> 22:27.146
told me to take the two grand 
and to keep my mouth shut.

22:29.414 --> 22:32.840
- Was she alone?
- Yeah.

22:32.840 --> 22:35.463
It was just her in the room.

22:35.463 --> 22:37.823
GATEWAY INN
QUEENS, NEW YORK
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10

22:37.823 --> 22:41.366
The girl that was in here,
was there anybody with her?

22:41.366 --> 22:43.378
No, sir. She was alone 
when she checked in last night.

22:43.378 --> 22:45.162
We'll need a record of her calls.

22:45.162 --> 22:47.603
We don't provide phones.
There's a pay phone at the corner.

22:47.603 --> 22:49.399
Thank you.

22:49.399 --> 22:51.589
We'll need the LUDS on the pay phone.

22:51.589 --> 22:53.007
The room's all yours.

22:54.963 --> 22:56.478
You done?

23:01.644 --> 23:06.230
He drew another one.
He drew it over and over again.

23:17.713 --> 23:19.909
He drew a map of Times Square?

23:19.909 --> 23:25.678
Yeah. He's trying to remember 
his way around, orient himself.

23:25.678 --> 23:32.127
It's this area here.
That's where they're heading.

23:32.127 --> 23:34.771
Times Square?
What's there for them?

23:34.771 --> 23:41.141
Well, for these two,
uh, the whole world.

23:41.141 --> 23:46.123
Look at it. It's all there.
Right there.

23:46.123 --> 23:48.231
Just like you remember?

23:48.231 --> 23:52.817
No, better. 'Cause it's got you in it.

24:00.123 --> 24:01.836
It's pizza.

24:03.591 --> 24:06.229
- Hi. Large Hawaiian?
- Yeah. How much?

24:10.258 --> 24:13.382
- How much does it say?
- It's right there at the bottom.

24:13.382 --> 24:16.633
- You saying somethin'?
- No, I was just...

24:16.633 --> 24:22.900
He doesn't have his glasses.
Here. Just give him this, sweetie.

24:34.731 --> 24:39.164
Baby, come on. No.

24:40.459 --> 24:45.004
That guy is nothing.
You are a man,

24:45.004 --> 24:52.459
the man who's taken me 
all the way to the penthouse.

24:55.484 --> 24:57.469
- No? Okay.
- Keep an eye out, huh?

24:57.469 --> 25:00.679
The next one's the Doric on 47 th.

25:00.679 --> 25:03.434
- You wanna take the car?
- No. Why? It's only a couple blocks.

25:03.434 --> 25:07.530
Well, your feet hurt. I noticed that you're 
curling your toes in your shoes.

25:07.530 --> 25:09.490
Goren.

25:11.528 --> 25:13.314
We'll be right there.

25:13.314 --> 25:15.775
Pancake house, three blocks down.

25:45.118 --> 25:47.150
What's she doing?

25:48.484 --> 25:50.641
There.

25:53.059 --> 25:55.413
All right. Move in now.
Pick her up.

26:24.592 --> 26:28.514
You back off.

26:28.514 --> 26:30.434
Help me, please!

26:30.434 --> 26:32.620
They're trying to kill me!

26:32.620 --> 26:33.771
Thank God you're here.

26:33.771 --> 26:35.603
They were gonna kill me for sure.

26:35.603 --> 26:38.614
Thank you. Thank you!

26:42.288 --> 26:46.744
I wasn't even there!
After that shoplifting thing,

26:46.744 --> 26:50.223
Miss Hurst told me they'd incarcerate me 
forever if I got in trouble again.

26:50.223 --> 26:53.500
So you were supposed to count money,
but you didn't show up.

26:53.500 --> 26:57.215
What I'm saying.
And then all these people got killed.

26:57.215 --> 27:00.735
And I hear Manny's looking for me,
and I got scared.

27:00.735 --> 27:03.475
I'm a good girl. I swear.

27:03.475 --> 27:05.893
I just got caught in a bad situation.

27:05.893 --> 27:07.568
Looks like your ankle got caught too.

27:07.568 --> 27:10.149
I tripped on the stoop outside my...

27:12.363 --> 27:16.111
That's a great-looking bandage.
Did you do that?

27:18.539 --> 27:22.662
My old boyfriend, Eugene, works on 
an ambulance, and he fixed it for me.

27:22.662 --> 27:24.344
He took me to a motel, he said,

27:24.344 --> 27:26.734
'cause he didn't want nobody see 
him do work on the side.

27:26.734 --> 27:30.823
He told us you paid him $2,000
and threatened him with a gun.

27:30.823 --> 27:33.302
Okay, if Eugene Thomas is your only 
witness, you're in trouble.

27:33.302 --> 27:37.122
We also have a subway attendant who 
saw her limp through his turnstile...

27:37.122 --> 27:39.775
the night of the murders,
with a male accomplice.

27:39.775 --> 27:43.359
That wasn't me!
I don't have no male accomplice!

27:43.359 --> 27:44.894
I don't have nobody.

27:44.894 --> 27:46.093
We're finished here.

27:46.093 --> 27:49.185
Tamara has suffered years of emotional 
and physical abuse.

27:49.185 --> 27:50.218
She's in no condition to be...

27:50.218 --> 27:53.722
Is that what's going on, Tamara?

27:53.722 --> 27:57.983
You're being abused by this guy,
and you're afraid to talk?

28:05.919 --> 28:08.862
I'm always hookin' up with guys 
who end up beatin' on me.

28:11.076 --> 28:14.954
But I don't got nobody now.

28:14.954 --> 28:18.256
There you have it.

28:28.578 --> 28:30.425
Don't get your hopes up.

28:30.425 --> 28:33.681
They found the hotel room.
Nothing left but the party favors.

28:34.785 --> 28:38.224
I don't remember her.
He prepaid the room for three nights.

28:38.224 --> 28:42.936
Jerome Davis.
I.D. From Club 79 in Long Island City.

28:42.936 --> 28:45.946
You generally accept work I.D.'s 
for identification?

28:45.946 --> 28:49.424
- Well, when they don't have a driver's 
license... / - And if they pay cash.

28:49.424 --> 28:52.334
Was the A.C. On or off 
when you came in here?

28:52.334 --> 28:54.409
It was off.

28:54.409 --> 28:58.184
Some people like a warm room.

28:58.184 --> 29:02.462
They unscrewed the fluorescent light 
and moved this table lamp in here.

29:02.462 --> 29:07.511
After a week of killings,
nothing like soft lights and a warm bath.

29:10.978 --> 29:14.185
You know, Tamara's shoplifting beef in...
in Queens...

29:14.185 --> 29:18.246
was for extra-strength headache pills.

29:18.246 --> 29:21.283
Some people get headaches from 
fluorescent lights and air conditioning.

29:21.283 --> 29:24.169
She didn't seem to mind the lights 
in the interrogation room.

29:24.169 --> 29:29.149
They weren't her pills?
Did... Did you, uh...

29:29.149 --> 29:32.122
Did you notice anything unusual 
about him when he checked in?

29:32.122 --> 29:33.666
He asked for directions.

29:33.666 --> 29:38.376
He asked me if I knew a martial arts store 
off Times Square...

29:38.376 --> 29:42.222
one with a big yellow sun on the outside.

29:51.226 --> 29:54.642
You remember that martial arts store, 
Happy Sun?

29:54.642 --> 29:56.761
Sure. Back in the bad old days 
of Times Square,

29:56.761 --> 29:59.037
every kung fu wannabe used to 
hang out there.

29:59.037 --> 30:01.862
It was here.
It was right here.

30:01.862 --> 30:03.875
That's what he was trying to remember...

30:03.875 --> 30:05.656
how to get there.

30:05.656 --> 30:07.940
But that place closed,
what, 10, 12 years ago?

30:07.940 --> 30:10.200
Eleven. That's probably 
how long Davis was out of town.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.570
That would explain why 
he's not in the system.

30:16.201 --> 30:20.560
Well, there might be one system 
that he's still in.

30:24.099 --> 30:28.099
Kids who transferred out of 
the school system.

30:28.099 --> 30:32.299
Jerome Davis.Transferred out in 1992 
to Florida with his mother.

30:32.299 --> 30:34.027
Father is deceased.

30:36.430 --> 30:38.553
His records show a lot of medical absences.

30:38.553 --> 30:40.653
Maybe because of migraines.

30:40.653 --> 30:42.111
He repeated the third grade.

30:42.111 --> 30:47.547
Had disciplinary problems 
through grade four and five.

30:47.547 --> 30:49.917
He grew up in Sunnyside, Queens.

30:49.917 --> 30:53.274
It's the same neighborhood as the 
pharmacy Tamara shoplifted from.

30:53.274 --> 30:57.201
Home turf. The one place 
he wouldn't need a map.

31:04.960 --> 31:09.476
- Hey, how long is it gonna take?
- Okay, thank you.

31:09.476 --> 31:12.003
I can't fill this. 
There are no refills left,

31:12.003 --> 31:13.756
and I can't get hold of 
your doctor in Florida.

31:13.756 --> 31:15.760
Just give it to me anyway.
My head's hurting.

31:15.760 --> 31:19.057
Sorry. I can't do that. But there are some 
over-the-counter medications...

31:27.002 --> 31:31.049
Jerome, welcome home.

31:31.049 --> 31:33.370
I didn't kill no people,
and I don't know no Tamara.

31:33.370 --> 31:37.068
You don't know the girl that gave 
you 40 bucks for the pizza man?

31:44.122 --> 31:47.009
Does your head hurt, Jerome?
Imitrex.

31:47.009 --> 31:49.501
That's some pretty heavy-duty stuff.

31:49.501 --> 31:51.125
If your client is indisposed...

31:51.125 --> 31:57.366
- Nothing's wrong with me.
- Okay.

31:57.366 --> 32:01.051
Let's talk about Happy Sun.

32:01.051 --> 32:03.409
You were asking around for it.

32:03.409 --> 32:05.350
Didn't you use to go there a lot 
when you were a kid?

32:05.350 --> 32:06.912
I went once with my pops.

32:06.912 --> 32:08.397
That's a really cool place.

32:08.397 --> 32:13.165
You remember the wall with the throwing 
stars and the tanto knives?

32:15.253 --> 32:19.330
You wanna know what happened to it?
'Cause I found this article.

32:22.171 --> 32:25.453
You... You need your-your-your glasses?

32:25.453 --> 32:27.890
Nothin' wrong with my eyes.
I'll check this out later.

32:27.890 --> 32:32.562
It just says that it closed in 1992...

32:32.562 --> 32:35.484
that's after you went to Florida 
with your mom...

32:35.484 --> 32:38.867
and that it was on 40th,
off of 7th.

32:38.867 --> 32:41.468
You know what?
Let me show you on a map.

32:41.468 --> 32:46.779
It was right about here...
on this map that you drew.

32:46.779 --> 32:49.318
- Don't respond to that.
- You like to draw maps.

32:49.318 --> 32:52.900
'Cause you leave them all over the place.

32:54.982 --> 32:57.243
Like this one.

32:57.243 --> 33:00.201
About 20 feet from where 
these cops were killed.

33:00.201 --> 33:01.331
I got nothin' to say to you.

33:01.331 --> 33:06.248
Jerome, you're facing the death penalty.

33:06.248 --> 33:08.605
But if you say you didn't know 
that they were cops...

33:08.605 --> 33:12.807
Detective, he said he's through.
I want time with my client.

33:21.160 --> 33:25.305
Without the murder weapons or the money, 
the worst he's facing is a gun charge.

33:25.305 --> 33:29.070
And I can't promise I can make anything 
at all stick against his lady friend.

33:29.070 --> 33:30.600
That might not be so bad.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.332
We cut her loose, she might lead us to 
where he stashed the money.

33:33.332 --> 33:35.067
If she knows where.

33:35.067 --> 33:37.524
We can give him an opportunity to tell her.

33:37.524 --> 33:40.124
What do you think about this plan, Detective?

33:40.124 --> 33:42.825
It-It might be worth a shot.

33:42.825 --> 33:45.589
Davis's rap sheet in Florida doesn't include 
any violence toward women.

33:45.589 --> 33:48.373
- Not even one complaint.
- Hmm.

33:48.373 --> 33:52.215
Abuse might not be what's binding 
Tamara to Davis.

33:52.215 --> 33:55.637
Then what is? Love?

33:55.637 --> 33:57.432
Maybe for him.

33:57.432 --> 34:01.592
But Tamara's an abused woman.
She's manipulative.

34:01.592 --> 34:08.222
She might be conditioned to only
respect men that hit her. / Hmm.

34:08.222 --> 34:10.480
You know, when she was 
at that pancake house,

34:10.480 --> 34:13.239
she didn't eat anything,
she didn't buy anything,

34:13.239 --> 34:15.164
she didn't leave with anything.

34:15.164 --> 34:19.945
- Where are you going?
- Out for pancakes.

34:19.945 --> 34:21.656
I don't see anything new here.

34:21.656 --> 34:24.221
Obviously, arresting Mr. Davis hasn't 
brought you any closer

34:24.221 --> 34:26.252
to fabricating a case against my client.

34:26.252 --> 34:28.766
You're free to bring a 210-40 motion.

34:28.766 --> 34:33.873
I plan to.
This won't survive arraignment.

34:33.873 --> 34:35.523
Does that mean I'm getting out?

34:35.523 --> 34:40.523
If you don't, you have my permission 
to fire me. Let's go.

34:42.681 --> 34:46.565
Here's crossing my fingers she bought it.

34:46.565 --> 34:50.222
NEW YORK COUNTY
COURTHOUSE
618 WORTH STREET
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 15

35:01.162 --> 35:04.154
They're not talking to each other.
They're not even blowing kisses.

35:04.154 --> 35:06.155
She might already know 
where he hid the money.

35:06.155 --> 35:08.488
- Then we follow her.
- She won't go to it.

35:08.488 --> 35:10.914
She's smart. She'll disappear.

35:10.914 --> 35:12.581
She'll send someone else to pick it up.

35:12.581 --> 35:15.081
- You're overestimating this girl.
- Hardly.

35:15.081 --> 35:17.189
These are the records from the pay 
phone at the pancake house.

35:17.189 --> 35:19.436
This line right here.

35:24.049 --> 35:27.011
Come on. Let's go.

35:27.011 --> 35:29.678
Tamara, I messed up on your booking form.

35:29.678 --> 35:31.973
Your social security number 
didn't come up right.

35:31.973 --> 35:35.349
I gotta fix it before they call you 
in for arraignment.

35:35.349 --> 35:39.395
So if you could just write it here.

35:39.395 --> 35:43.995
I must've inverted the numbers or something.

35:43.995 --> 35:48.832
You ever do that?
Great.

35:48.832 --> 35:52.102
Well, your grandmother's gonna 
be happy to see you, huh?

35:52.102 --> 35:58.958
Probably have a really nice meal waitin' 
for you when you get home tonight.

35:58.958 --> 36:04.341
She didn't tell you?
Sorry. I forgot. You guys, uh...

36:04.341 --> 36:06.188
You don't know each other.

36:06.188 --> 36:13.121
The judge will probably drop the charges 
against her and send her home.

36:13.121 --> 36:15.430
Maybe she was gonna tell you later, Jerome.

36:15.430 --> 36:21.713
We were lookin'over your paperwork, and 
there's a form that didn't get filled out.

36:21.713 --> 36:24.548
You need to read it, sign it.

36:24.548 --> 36:28.282
It needs to be filled out before we can
transfer you to the Department of Corrections.

36:28.282 --> 36:32.086
- What is it? 
- It's just a form. Read it.

36:32.086 --> 36:37.771
- Maybe my lawyer should look at it.
- You're kidding me, right?

36:37.771 --> 36:39.690
Come on. What's the matter?
You can't read?

36:39.690 --> 36:42.000
Come on, Jerome.
Let's go! Let's go!

36:42.000 --> 36:44.836
Would you like one of us to read it to you?

36:49.430 --> 36:52.885
I mean, it's like he's a baby.
Doesn't know his ABC's.

36:52.885 --> 36:54.726
Shut up.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.213
You can't read.

37:06.356 --> 37:10.595
Is that right?
You can't.

37:11.344 --> 37:15.908
You can shoot two cops,
but dumb as this bench!

37:15.908 --> 37:18.688
Leave him alone.
He's not dumb!

37:18.688 --> 37:21.259
He's smart! He's a man.

37:21.259 --> 37:26.562
Why don't you take off his chains 
and see how smart you are?

37:26.562 --> 37:31.512
Oh. Oh, that's it.

37:31.512 --> 37:34.929
You look out for him.

37:34.929 --> 37:38.357
Aw, you don't let him feel ashamed.

37:38.357 --> 37:42.031
You don't make fun of his problem.

37:42.031 --> 37:47.298
Your problem, Jerome.
Hmm?

37:47.298 --> 37:50.950
Do you know what that problem is?

37:50.950 --> 37:53.282
Why you get headaches?

37:53.282 --> 37:57.244
Why, when you look at that form,
all the letters,

37:57.244 --> 38:01.109
- they get jumbled in your head?
- I'm not dumb.

38:01.109 --> 38:06.648
Why you can look at a window frame once...
and build this, have it fit perfectly?

38:06.648 --> 38:09.421
I didn't build nothin'.

38:09.421 --> 38:14.514
Draw maps from, uh...
from memory?

38:17.652 --> 38:24.893
People that have your problem,
they think in three dimensions.

38:24.893 --> 38:28.378
Some of them become rocket scientists.

38:28.378 --> 38:34.656
No? Yeah.
Work for NASA.

38:34.656 --> 38:42.855
You're not dumb, Jerome.
You're just dyslexic.

38:42.855 --> 38:44.589
It's a learning disability.

38:44.589 --> 38:46.930
If you'd been to the right school,
you might've been helped.

38:46.930 --> 38:50.677
Instead, they held you back,
kids made fun of you,

38:50.677 --> 38:54.720
you got into fights.
And girls...

38:54.720 --> 38:58.234
when they figured out you couldn't read,
they made fun of you.

38:58.234 --> 39:01.453
They laughed at you,
didn't they?

39:01.453 --> 39:06.900
Made you feel like 
you were less of a man.

39:09.793 --> 39:12.275
But not Tamara.

39:12.275 --> 39:17.204
No, she saw your...

39:17.204 --> 39:24.562
potential, your rage.

39:24.562 --> 39:28.000
She identified your weakness,
and she played you.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.847
I played him?

39:29.847 --> 39:32.713
She puffs you up,
runs interference, right?

39:32.713 --> 39:35.315
Makes excuses for you,
tells you what a big man you are.

39:35.315 --> 39:37.346
I've never played anyone in my life!

39:37.346 --> 39:39.361
I'm the one who's always getting played!

39:39.361 --> 39:42.407
Didn't she give you 
what you wanted...

39:42.407 --> 39:45.207
respect?

39:45.207 --> 39:47.896
She used you to get what she wanted.

39:47.896 --> 39:50.818
The drug-money caper,
whose idea was that?

39:50.818 --> 39:52.662
We don't know anything about that.

39:52.662 --> 39:54.966
Who hooked you up 
with Darren and Levon?

39:54.966 --> 39:56.922
We don't know those people.

39:56.922 --> 39:58.617
When you were in the hotel,

39:58.617 --> 40:01.636
and you woke up and she wasn't there,

40:01.636 --> 40:05.465
what'd you think?

40:05.465 --> 40:09.003
Did she say that she was going out for 
pancakes and that you shouldn't be troubled?

40:09.003 --> 40:12.150
Or did she wait till you were asleep 
and too drunk to wake up?

40:12.150 --> 40:16.024
Because when we picked her up,
she was coming out of a pancake house.

40:16.024 --> 40:18.187
But she didn't eat any pancakes.

40:18.187 --> 40:19.777
What she did was,
she made a phone call.

40:19.777 --> 40:23.099
That's a lie! They are lying, baby.

40:23.099 --> 40:25.265
She called this number right here.

40:25.265 --> 40:28.146
It's a number of an old boyfriend she's 
been calling since he dumped her.

40:28.146 --> 40:30.310
Don't listen to this bull!

40:30.310 --> 40:34.209
But this time,
she asked him to pick her up.

40:34.209 --> 40:37.989
- That she had a surprise for him.
- 400,000 surprises.

40:37.989 --> 40:41.491
She was skipping on you,
Jerome, with the money.

40:41.491 --> 40:45.012
That's not true.
I'm not like that.

40:45.012 --> 40:47.269
You know I'm not like that.

40:47.269 --> 40:50.710
We talked to her boyfriend.
He told us what she said.

41:00.388 --> 41:01.724
You know what?
It doesn't matter,

41:01.724 --> 41:03.068
because in five minutes,

41:03.068 --> 41:05.996
she's gonna be leaving this building 
a free woman,

41:05.996 --> 41:09.662
and that'll be the last time 
that you see her or the money.

41:09.662 --> 41:13.831
Never! Baby, never!
These police are lying to you!

41:13.831 --> 41:15.655
Lying?

41:19.659 --> 41:21.252
Check it out.

41:23.254 --> 41:24.906
Here.

41:28.412 --> 41:32.065
Tamara will read it to you.

41:32.065 --> 41:36.754
Call it.
Talk to her ex-boyfriend.

41:36.754 --> 41:38.130
Come on, Tamara, read it.

41:38.130 --> 41:41.640
Read him the number.

41:41.640 --> 41:44.189
Read me the number.

41:44.189 --> 41:48.724
Baby, don't make me do this.

41:48.724 --> 41:56.272
Read me the damn number.

42:03.822 --> 42:08.015
You bitch! I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

42:08.015 --> 42:11.963
I perpetrated those murders for you,
and you were playing me?

42:11.963 --> 42:14.876
Bitch, you ain't never 
gonna be a free woman.

42:14.876 --> 42:17.670
I'll tell you where the money is.
I'll tell you everything that bitch did!

42:17.670 --> 42:22.090
Shut your mouth! He...
He made me do it!

42:22.090 --> 42:24.762
What? / He was beating on me! 
Abusing me!

42:24.762 --> 42:26.853
You look at me! Look!

42:26.853 --> 42:30.768
They are gonna kill me for what I did for
you! They are gonna kill me!

42:30.768 --> 42:34.059
Get off me! Get off me!
I'm gonna kill that bitch!

42:34.059 --> 42:37.830
I swear to God!
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill her!

42:37.830 --> 42:43.075
- How did it look on tape?
- Damning.

42:44.152 --> 42:46.625
The girl pleaded to life without parole.

42:46.625 --> 42:51.540
As for Mr. Davis,the district attorney...
has decided to seek the death penalty.

42:51.540 --> 42:53.667
Are you all right with that?

42:53.667 --> 42:57.377
Uh, now is the wrong time to ask.

42:57.377 --> 43:00.607
Ready? We have half an hour to get uptown.

43:00.607 --> 43:02.596
Eames is gonna meet us at the church.

43:05.981 --> 43:09.610
All right. Let's go.
