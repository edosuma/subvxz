WEBVTT

00:02.524 --> 00:03.835
Here you go.

00:06.664 --> 00:09.362
Yeah, I used to clap
like that for cocaine.

00:10.351 --> 00:13.752
Mmm. I started thinking
about this during the meeting.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.232
Was it while this one was sharing?

00:15.276 --> 00:17.469
'Cause I was thinking about sloppy Joes.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.570
Are they really sloppy? And who's Joe?

00:22.609 --> 00:24.763
That was a really
heartfelt share, you guys.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.243
Oh, honey, I listened.

00:26.310 --> 00:27.659
Yeah? What was it about?

00:28.906 --> 00:29.942
You...

00:29.986 --> 00:31.901
And pain and...

00:31.944 --> 00:34.727
how glad you are to be sober.

00:35.122 --> 00:37.070
You were listening!

00:37.602 --> 00:38.603
- Hey.
- Hey!

00:38.647 --> 00:40.605
- You're back!
- How was prison?

00:40.649 --> 00:42.738
Well, I got to bring
a sandwich and leave,

00:42.781 --> 00:44.859
so way better than last time.

00:45.227 --> 00:46.611
Tammy did a great job

00:46.655 --> 00:48.891
making amends to some
of her fellow inmates.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.845
And I totally lucked
out, 'cause two were dead.

00:50.876 --> 00:53.618
One natural causes;
one shanked in the yard.

00:54.383 --> 00:56.404
Man, I do not miss
those volleyball games.

00:57.453 --> 00:58.483
Yeah.

00:58.508 --> 01:01.191
Well, she's gonna make a donation
to charity in their names.

01:01.235 --> 01:04.000
Yeah, you said that a lot in
the car, but I never agreed.

01:04.468 --> 01:06.196
Yeah, she's big on charities.

01:06.259 --> 01:08.391
I went to make an
amends to a dry cleaners,

01:08.416 --> 01:10.809
but the shop was gone. Next
thing I know, I'm writing

01:10.834 --> 01:14.000
a check to save a bunch of
animals I used to wear as coats.

01:17.312 --> 01:19.184
And how did you feel afterwards?

01:19.688 --> 01:21.907
Light as a feather. Shut up.

01:22.336 --> 01:23.779
So, who's next on your list?

01:23.859 --> 01:27.108
Oh, the foster parents
Bonnie and I lived with.

01:27.133 --> 01:30.195
Yeah, I-I keep pushing it down,
but I think I got to do it.

01:30.238 --> 01:31.631
Oh, honey, you're ready.

01:31.804 --> 01:34.024
I don't know. Bonnie, when
you did it, how'd it go?

01:37.828 --> 01:39.534
Classic amends.

01:40.008 --> 01:42.366
Start out awkward,
push through the pain,

01:42.391 --> 01:45.192
end it with hugs and tears,
and afterwards I felt...

01:45.766 --> 01:48.064
How did you put it, Jill? It was so apt.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.414
Yes. Light as a feather.

01:50.535 --> 01:53.451
- Too much detail. She's lying.
- Mm-hmm.

01:54.511 --> 01:56.818
Never snitch on the family.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.771
Oh, Bonnie, you got to make amends

01:59.815 --> 02:01.599
to your foster parents.

02:01.643 --> 02:04.399
- They were there for you when...
- Back it down, mouse.

02:04.689 --> 02:06.517
Wait, it's perfect.
You can come with me.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.476
We'll do it together. Amends buddies.

02:08.519 --> 02:09.955
That's a great idea.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.695
Is it, Marge?

02:12.922 --> 02:15.178
You should do it.

02:15.222 --> 02:18.050
I mean, what else have you got going on?

02:18.094 --> 02:21.880
Well, aren't you full of
opinions with your messy mouth.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.187
Ow. Ow!

02:24.231 --> 02:26.537
Stay still. You dipped
your napkin in my water.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.695
Well, I'm still drinking mine.

02:29.105 --> 02:34.105

02:40.516 --> 02:42.311
This is so weird.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.294
It looks exactly the same.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.991
Oh, my God, check it out. I'm shaking.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.385
Can we agree this is 20 minutes maximum

02:48.429 --> 02:50.170
unless there are snacks?

02:50.195 --> 02:52.476
- Works for me.
- Uh-huh.

02:52.789 --> 02:54.043
Wait, what are you doing?

02:54.086 --> 02:56.088
I'm just making sure
they still live here.

02:56.132 --> 02:59.608
Here we go. Electric
bill to Claire Dickinson.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.765
All right, this is really happening.

03:02.524 --> 03:05.500
Think she wants this
Bed Bath & Beyond coupon?

03:06.320 --> 03:07.448
I need towels.

03:08.305 --> 03:11.103
We're here to make an amends.
You're already stealing?

03:11.128 --> 03:13.008
It really is like old times.

03:15.211 --> 03:16.587
Can I help you?

03:16.631 --> 03:18.154
Mrs. Dickinson, it's us.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.349
We used to live here.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.592
Bonnie and Tammy?

03:21.636 --> 03:23.290
Oh, my goodness.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.508
You remember?

03:24.552 --> 03:25.857
Of course I do!

03:25.901 --> 03:27.642
You're the tallest girls I ever saw.

03:27.685 --> 03:28.773
Come in, come in.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.122
She got old.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.299
- We got old.
- Not that old.

03:32.342 --> 03:33.691
â™ª

03:33.735 --> 03:36.346
Sorry, ladies, no bistro for us tonight.

03:36.563 --> 03:38.976
Marjorie got tickets to
a show and invited me.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.133
Oh, well, doesn't that sound like fun.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.266
I'm sure there's more
tickets if you want to come.

03:43.291 --> 03:46.266
The Napa Valley Retirement Home
is doing The Book of Mormon.

03:47.797 --> 03:50.534
We don't need to do
everything as a group.

03:50.922 --> 03:52.381
All right, Wendy, we better get going.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.375
Curtain's up at 6:00.

03:54.886 --> 03:56.627
Have fun.

03:57.328 --> 03:59.848
Yeah, so I guess it's just
you and me at the bistro.

03:59.891 --> 04:03.025
Yep. The cool kids.

04:03.068 --> 04:05.810
And that's not just what I call
us... I've heard other people say it.

04:05.835 --> 04:07.924
Oh.

04:09.074 --> 04:10.075
What?

04:10.119 --> 04:12.252
Those two guys are staring at us.

04:12.295 --> 04:14.428
Oh, now they're coming over
here, they're moving fast,

04:14.471 --> 04:15.472
and here they are.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.474
- Hey!
- Hey.

04:17.517 --> 04:20.738
Um, really liked your share. Mark.

04:20.781 --> 04:22.218
Christy.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.307
I don't even know what I said.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.415
Whenever I share, I sort of black out

04:26.440 --> 04:28.922
and then come to when I sit back down.

04:29.157 --> 04:31.028
Well, you were talking about your mom.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.968
Yep, that sounds like me.

04:33.180 --> 04:35.206
Christy, we should go.

04:35.231 --> 04:38.278
- Well, Dane and I were...
- I'm Dane.

04:40.805 --> 04:42.499
Hi.

04:43.266 --> 04:46.170
We-we were wondering if you'd
like to get a coffee with us.

04:46.195 --> 04:47.797
We've been wanting to ask for a while

04:47.822 --> 04:49.824
but we're scared of Marjorie.

04:51.468 --> 04:53.296
You're doing it again.

04:54.511 --> 04:58.061
Um, we usually grab a bite after
the meeting at Duke's Diner.

04:58.086 --> 05:01.313
- Oh, we wish we could, but...
- Sure! Why not!

05:04.391 --> 05:06.484
Why in the hell would you say yes?

05:06.802 --> 05:09.588
I thought it'd be fun to
be spontaneous for once.

05:09.613 --> 05:12.133
Then wear something that isn't a hoodie!

05:12.711 --> 05:15.663
Hey. Need I point out, neither
of us has a guy right now.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.882
I don't think we can afford to be picky.

05:17.926 --> 05:19.438
But those guys have heard our shares.

05:19.463 --> 05:21.030
They know everything about us.

05:21.181 --> 05:22.854
They know you're a former
stripper/gambling addict

05:22.879 --> 05:24.315
who still lives with her mom,

05:24.340 --> 05:27.430
and they know I've
had my teeth bleached!

05:27.737 --> 05:29.391
Look, this is good. We don't have

05:29.416 --> 05:31.548
to break it to them that we're in AA.

05:31.592 --> 05:34.055
That whole, "Would you
like something to drink?"

05:34.080 --> 05:37.344
"No, I'll have ginger ale,
'cause I'm on antibiotics."

05:37.399 --> 05:40.252
Or, "I'm still hungover
from last night."

05:40.277 --> 05:42.497
Or, "I might be pregnant."

05:42.559 --> 05:45.910
Mm. Bet that guy didn't call back.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.434
Actually, he did.

05:47.477 --> 05:48.859
Weird.

05:50.899 --> 05:53.328
All right, so which one do you want?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.964
Double divorce pill-head with
kids who don't talk to him,

05:56.007 --> 05:59.054
or heroin addict whose bottom
was waking up in a motel

05:59.079 --> 06:00.984
with something stuck in his bottom.

06:01.984 --> 06:03.928
He hit a bottom bottom.

06:09.337 --> 06:11.766
What? I still want to look good.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.897
Just look at the two of you!

06:15.940 --> 06:18.029
Oh, I only wish Frank were here.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.172
He would have loved this surprise.

06:20.197 --> 06:22.338
I know this is awkward, but is he, like,

06:22.363 --> 06:25.017
at the store or dead... ?

06:28.305 --> 06:30.085
He passed ten years ago.

06:30.128 --> 06:31.434
I'm so sorry.

06:31.478 --> 06:34.350
- He adored you, Tammy.
- Oh.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.569
I'm sorry, too.

06:35.986 --> 06:37.858
Thanks.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.662
Oh! I want to show you something.

06:41.687 --> 06:42.852
Oh...

06:43.274 --> 06:45.100
Well, two things haven't changed...

06:45.143 --> 06:47.537
this carpet, and she still hates me.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.060
She does not hate you.

06:49.104 --> 06:50.977
How would you know? You're
too busy getting adored

06:51.002 --> 06:52.305
by dead Frank.

06:52.797 --> 06:55.789
Do you recognize these?

06:55.814 --> 06:58.784
No way! I made those for
you, like, in eighth grade.

06:58.817 --> 07:01.559
- I love them, and I still
use them all the time. - Aw.

07:01.595 --> 07:03.814
Sweet! Do you have anything I made?

07:04.162 --> 07:07.000
The only thing you
ever made me was crazy.

07:10.187 --> 07:12.755
You know, speaking of crazy,
that's kind of why we're here.

07:12.780 --> 07:14.491
Um, now that I'm sober,

07:14.516 --> 07:16.174
I want to make an amends to you.

07:16.237 --> 07:18.369
Um, the night you kicked me out,

07:18.394 --> 07:21.615
I came back and I
destroyed your rosebushes.

07:21.658 --> 07:26.010
Not a great move in shorts,
but still, I'm sorry.

07:26.062 --> 07:28.847
I just assumed it was Bonnie.

07:29.961 --> 07:31.306
Nope. And for the record,

07:31.331 --> 07:33.594
Iraq... not my fault, either.

07:34.948 --> 07:38.377
From that night forward, I just
blamed you for every bad thing I did,

07:38.402 --> 07:41.194
and I carried that resentment
around with me for years,

07:41.219 --> 07:44.028
but you are not responsible
for how my life turned out.

07:44.383 --> 07:46.310
You don't know how much it means to me

07:46.335 --> 07:49.164
that you came all this way to apologize.

07:50.883 --> 07:52.795
Well, I've got something to say, too.

07:53.398 --> 07:56.789
I also got sober, and I also
would like to make an amends.

07:58.453 --> 08:00.411
I smoked marijuana in your house.

08:00.436 --> 08:02.305
I snuck in boys.

08:02.646 --> 08:04.822
I stole money and booze.

08:06.324 --> 08:08.117
And this coupon.

08:13.586 --> 08:15.793
And it was me that
planted Frank's wallet

08:15.818 --> 08:18.734
in Tammy's backpack, which
led you to kicking her out.

08:19.383 --> 08:20.543
Anyway...

08:20.680 --> 08:22.564
I hope you can accept my amends

08:22.589 --> 08:25.250
and just know that I don't
live my life like that anymore.

08:28.421 --> 08:29.683
Okay.

08:30.661 --> 08:32.837
How about I get us some cake?

08:37.804 --> 08:39.169
I'm so glad we did this.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.520
Well, of course you are.

08:40.544 --> 08:43.047
"I use your potholder every day!"

08:43.616 --> 08:45.481
- You're being so immature.
- Shut up!

08:45.525 --> 08:47.091
- You shut up.
- You shut up.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.353
Quit it! Stop it!

08:48.397 --> 08:49.529
Get off me!

08:50.592 --> 08:52.289
Girls!

08:52.314 --> 08:53.358
Girls!

08:53.402 --> 08:55.404
Sorry, Mrs. Dickinson.

09:02.961 --> 09:05.153
Well, here we are.

09:05.178 --> 09:06.528
Oh-ho, wow!

09:06.589 --> 09:08.504
Nothing's changed!

09:08.529 --> 09:10.879
Yes, we've covered that
nothing has changed.

09:10.904 --> 09:14.137
Oh, my God, I'm 14 again.

09:14.414 --> 09:16.643
This calls for hot chocolate.

09:16.668 --> 09:19.127
My favorite. I remember.

09:20.210 --> 09:22.212
And I'll take one, too.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.130
You can hear me, right?
My voice still works?

09:26.174 --> 09:28.002
Come on, Bonnie, it's not that bad.

09:28.064 --> 09:29.805
She didn't even acknowledge my amends.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.135
She totally blew me off.

09:31.563 --> 09:33.007
Well, I don't think that's the point.

09:33.050 --> 09:35.792
I mean, I think we're
here to clean up the past,

09:35.836 --> 09:37.577
and if we get a hug out of it, great.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.317
Yeah, says the girl who got a hug

09:39.342 --> 09:40.735
and a confirmed hot chocolate.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.734
Mine's still up in the air.

09:43.820 --> 09:46.149
I remember my first month here.

09:46.563 --> 09:49.522
I would just stare at the
ceiling and count those dots

09:49.547 --> 09:51.155
until I fell asleep.

09:51.445 --> 09:53.984
All I was doing was
planning ways to escape.

09:54.375 --> 09:57.161
Well, you did, out that
window, five nights a week.

09:57.186 --> 09:58.361
Ah.

09:58.386 --> 09:59.692
Hey.

09:59.717 --> 10:01.793
There's my old getaway tree.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.646
Maybe I could use it now.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.411
You do, and I'm telling.

10:05.436 --> 10:06.873
Yeah, you always did.

10:08.578 --> 10:09.696
The messed up thing is,

10:09.721 --> 10:11.897
as much as I hated this place,

10:12.014 --> 10:15.227
this ended up being the
best part of my childhood.

10:15.836 --> 10:17.660
Don't you wish you could go back

10:17.704 --> 10:20.227
and tell 14-year-old Bonnie,

10:20.453 --> 10:22.665
"Your life is gonna work out"?

10:22.690 --> 10:24.126
She wouldn't have listened.

10:24.151 --> 10:26.688
She would have flipped
me off and stolen my car.

10:31.352 --> 10:33.023
Okay, where the hell are they?

10:33.703 --> 10:35.460
Do you think it's
possible we got stood up?

10:35.485 --> 10:38.102
I think it's possible you got stood up.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.602
Which is crazy, because they were not...

10:41.989 --> 10:43.649
great.

10:44.742 --> 10:48.144
So, what do you want to do?
You want to stay?

10:48.461 --> 10:50.320
We could eat like it's not a date.

10:50.345 --> 10:51.975
You mean like chicken
fingers, onion rings

10:52.000 --> 10:53.610
and mozzarella sticks?

10:53.805 --> 10:56.481
Or something from the grown-up menu.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.727
Onion rings, onion rings, onion rings!

11:03.492 --> 11:05.204
Hey, Mrs. Dickinson.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.537
Oh, hi. Where's Tammy?

11:08.617 --> 11:11.384
She found her journal.
I thought I'd leave her alone

11:11.409 --> 11:14.258
with her rudimentary
drawings of David Cassidy.

11:15.644 --> 11:18.520
- Need any help?
- No, I've-I've got it.

11:20.149 --> 11:22.856
You know, a couple fun
facts I didn't get to share.

11:22.881 --> 11:23.875
I have a daughter.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.032
She's in law school.

11:25.586 --> 11:26.860
I have a fiancÃ©.

11:26.885 --> 11:28.321
He's in a wheelchair.

11:28.687 --> 11:31.211
Yeah. I'm that good a person.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.606
I manage an apartment building.

11:35.320 --> 11:38.523
Wish I'd ended on
"wheelchair," but you get it.

11:39.188 --> 11:41.250
That's very nice, Bonnie.

11:42.445 --> 11:43.983
"Very nice"?

11:44.008 --> 11:46.227
I'm a frickin' miracle.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.445
You know what?

11:47.489 --> 11:48.925
You know what, forget it.

11:49.266 --> 11:50.641
But I got to tell you,

11:50.666 --> 11:52.102
this is just like when we were kids.

11:52.146 --> 11:54.409
You always loved Tammy and you hated me.

11:54.727 --> 11:56.716
I never hated you.

11:57.001 --> 11:59.525
Then why did Tammy get
all the special treatment?

12:00.913 --> 12:02.156
Sit down.

12:06.492 --> 12:09.641
I may have given extra
attention to Tammy

12:09.666 --> 12:13.531
because she came from
such a difficult situation.

12:13.776 --> 12:14.777
So did I.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.368
This was my ninth foster home.

12:16.393 --> 12:18.234
But it was Tammy's first.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.261
And it was right after the incident.

12:20.286 --> 12:21.541
Well, I had incidents, too.

12:21.566 --> 12:22.524
Plenty of 'em.

12:22.567 --> 12:23.655
Yeah.

12:23.680 --> 12:25.813
But your father didn't kill your mother.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.272
I assumed that you knew.

12:32.703 --> 12:34.884
Oh, she never spoke
to me about it either.

12:34.909 --> 12:36.570
The social worker told me.

12:39.042 --> 12:40.219
God.

12:43.258 --> 12:45.870
She was so fragile when she came here.

12:46.328 --> 12:48.942
I needed to make an extra effort

12:48.967 --> 12:50.695
so she knew she was loved.

12:52.203 --> 12:54.883
All this time, I thought
you just didn't like me.

12:55.774 --> 12:58.250
Oh, I guess that wasn't fair to you.

13:00.623 --> 13:03.422
Well, I will say, you
didn't make it easy.

13:03.624 --> 13:05.583
Any time I reached out to you,

13:05.608 --> 13:08.437
you had your walls up pretty high.

13:10.867 --> 13:13.618
I eventually just made sure

13:13.643 --> 13:15.987
that you had a roof over your head

13:16.012 --> 13:17.840
and food on your plate and...

13:17.884 --> 13:19.391
clothes on your back.

13:20.727 --> 13:23.150
I'd argue with you, but I was...

13:23.419 --> 13:26.205
well, let's say a handful.

13:27.433 --> 13:28.608
By the time I got to you,

13:28.633 --> 13:30.641
you just looked like
the rest of 'em to me.

13:32.117 --> 13:33.769
Well, for what it's worth,

13:34.281 --> 13:35.902
it sounds like

13:36.382 --> 13:39.078
you have made a great life for yourself.

13:41.125 --> 13:44.388
I am proud of you, Bonnie.

13:45.072 --> 13:46.351
You are?

13:51.971 --> 13:54.117
Why don't I get you a hot chocolate.

13:57.641 --> 13:59.534
I want to take these
onion rings home with me

13:59.559 --> 14:01.406
and do terrible things to them.

14:02.445 --> 14:03.905
Dip it in sauce.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.018
Which one?

14:05.043 --> 14:06.436
All three.

14:06.497 --> 14:08.586
- At the same time?
- Just do it.

14:14.133 --> 14:15.811
Oh!

14:16.266 --> 14:19.467
We should bottle this.
We'd make millions.

14:19.939 --> 14:22.942
We'll call it ran-barbe-tard.

14:24.453 --> 14:26.996
Andy taught me the
magic of the triple dip.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.999
Mmm. You really liked him, didn't you?

14:30.289 --> 14:31.889
It was the first time I was with a guy

14:31.914 --> 14:33.960
and didn't once think about my ex.

14:34.003 --> 14:36.961
It's been so long since I've
felt like that about anyone.

14:37.750 --> 14:40.662
I do find it odd that you're so, so, so,

14:40.687 --> 14:42.907
so single all the time.

14:43.859 --> 14:47.083
I mean, you're pretty, you're smart,

14:47.108 --> 14:48.558
you're nice.

14:48.883 --> 14:50.715
Do you want to go out with me?

14:51.227 --> 14:53.327
Check back in a year.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.764
- Aw.
- Hmm.

14:55.807 --> 14:56.896
What are you doing?

14:56.939 --> 14:58.158
Putting it in my phone.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.986
"April 2020.

15:00.029 --> 15:02.047
Lesbian, question mark."

15:02.510 --> 15:03.467
Aw.

15:05.078 --> 15:07.011
Uh, should we get out of here?

15:07.036 --> 15:09.430
Yeah. Let's go see a movie or something.

15:09.455 --> 15:10.842
Okay. I'll get this.

15:10.867 --> 15:12.086
You get the popcorn.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.368
This turned out
to be a pretty good night.

15:15.392 --> 15:16.698
I know. I had fun.

15:16.741 --> 15:18.004
Screw those guys, right?

15:18.029 --> 15:20.453
Not even if I was still drinking.

15:23.227 --> 15:25.620
Hey!

15:25.663 --> 15:27.622
We're so sorry. Dane's
car wouldn't start.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.624
- Subaru!
- Uh,

15:29.667 --> 15:31.974
- no, no, no, no, no, no problem.
- No...

15:32.242 --> 15:35.456
Oh, my God, that was the
longest 27 minutes of my life.

15:35.922 --> 15:38.024
By the way, nice fake migraine.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.940
Mm. I learned that in
tenth grade gym class.

15:41.352 --> 15:43.617
Never did climb that rope.

15:44.117 --> 15:46.016
It wasn't as bad as I
thought it was gonna be.

15:46.423 --> 15:47.642
That's 'cause you had Mark.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.843
I had Dane!

15:51.250 --> 15:52.864
Mark was kind of nice.

15:52.908 --> 15:55.432
Oh, come on. He had the
overhand grip on his fork.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.434
Looked like a three-year-old
eating pudding.

16:00.234 --> 16:03.049
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

16:03.074 --> 16:04.625
Well, you were speeding.

16:04.650 --> 16:06.376
I'm not the one who picked a movie

16:06.400 --> 16:07.420
that starts in five minutes.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.837
Well, at least I picked one.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.554
If I left it up to you,
we'd still be sitting there.

16:10.579 --> 16:12.477
Is this what it's gonna
be like when we're dating?

16:12.756 --> 16:15.141
Wait, we were joking about that, right?

16:18.500 --> 16:19.431
Mm.

16:20.482 --> 16:23.224
Good evening, Officer... Andy.

16:23.249 --> 16:24.555
That's not funny.

16:24.654 --> 16:27.203
Eh, I don't know. Sort of funny.

16:27.247 --> 16:29.771
Oh, Andy! Hey.

16:29.796 --> 16:30.928
Hi.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.600
It's really great to see you.

16:32.643 --> 16:33.949
Great to see you, too.

16:34.012 --> 16:35.926
License and registration, please.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.910
Oh. Even though we're friends?

16:38.954 --> 16:40.564
Okay.

16:40.626 --> 16:42.802
So, uh, how you been?

16:42.827 --> 16:43.959
Good. You?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.134
Good, good.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.135
You?

16:46.655 --> 16:48.570
Still good.

16:49.164 --> 16:50.574
Good.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.576
I'm good, too.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.970
Not "I can afford a
speeding ticket" good,

16:55.014 --> 16:56.624
but good.

16:57.274 --> 16:59.670
You know, uh, you popped
into my head the other day.

16:59.733 --> 17:01.082
I was in your neighborhood.

17:01.703 --> 17:03.587
There was a homeless guy
swimming in someone's pool.

17:03.631 --> 17:06.373
Ooh, I heard about that. Fully naked.

17:06.415 --> 17:08.498
Not true. He was wearing one sock.

17:08.522 --> 17:09.897
Strategically placed.

17:11.955 --> 17:13.586
Oh, ow.

17:15.009 --> 17:16.097
You okay?

17:16.746 --> 17:19.117
I think I'm getting a migraine.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.041
Maybe if I got a little fresh air.

17:23.067 --> 17:24.589
Would that be okay?

17:24.615 --> 17:25.484
Sure.

17:25.510 --> 17:26.902
Oh, thanks.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.545
I'll just leave my door open,

17:29.570 --> 17:31.137
in case you feel like sitting down.

17:31.162 --> 17:33.512
Okay.

17:34.977 --> 17:36.508
Teach her your migraine trick?

17:36.533 --> 17:38.840
Yeah. She's still working on it.

17:38.865 --> 17:41.719
Who does "ow"?

17:43.047 --> 17:44.255
May I?

17:44.298 --> 17:45.906
- Please.
- Thank you.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.373
Mother of pearl.

17:50.436 --> 17:52.394
Geez. Midsize.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.464
There we go.

17:56.693 --> 17:58.564
Nice to see you.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.168
Thanks.

18:02.578 --> 18:07.042
Look, I'm-I'm sorry
I ignored your texts.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.169
And phone calls and e-mails

18:09.194 --> 18:11.617
and the Edible Arrangement.

18:11.771 --> 18:13.719
Well, thanks to you, kiwi
is now a part of my life.

18:13.744 --> 18:16.375
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:18.074 --> 18:19.945
You know, I'm-I'm...

18:20.099 --> 18:23.386
feeling pretty bad about
the way I left things.

18:23.411 --> 18:25.609
I... I may have overreacted.

18:27.650 --> 18:29.087
Go on.

18:29.797 --> 18:32.172
Look, you got to understand, um...

18:33.563 --> 18:35.567
my divorce really did a number on me.

18:35.592 --> 18:38.984
And, uh, then you come along and...

18:40.203 --> 18:42.077
Well, look at you.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.166
Go on.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.562
I don't know. I guess, uh...

18:48.875 --> 18:50.930
I guess I just... I figured
it wasn't gonna work out,

18:50.955 --> 18:53.133
so I-I pulled the rip cord.

18:54.305 --> 18:56.570
Maybe a little too quickly.

18:57.524 --> 18:59.227
I think we both messed up.

19:00.617 --> 19:01.908
I'm really sorry.

19:02.845 --> 19:04.580
I'm sorry, too.

19:05.162 --> 19:07.947
Kiss her.

19:08.761 --> 19:11.314
How the hell did she get into my car?

19:13.926 --> 19:16.580
And let me go with a warning.

19:17.330 --> 19:18.853
All right, I got to
get her out of there.

19:18.896 --> 19:20.309
Um, um, I'll call you.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.595
- Sorry!
- Okay.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.225
- How do I turn it off?
- Let's just...

19:23.249 --> 19:25.773
I'm just gonna get out 
the way I came in.

19:25.816 --> 19:26.986
Here we are.

19:31.541 --> 19:32.798
I love this.

19:33.150 --> 19:35.783
I had no pictures of
us when we were kids.

19:36.424 --> 19:38.873
It's almost like we're sisters.

19:39.517 --> 19:41.080
Yeah.

19:44.025 --> 19:46.794
And like a sister, if
you ever want to talk...

19:47.102 --> 19:49.087
I know. Thanks.

19:50.299 --> 19:51.339
I mean about anything.

19:51.364 --> 19:54.367
I'm... I'm always here for you.

19:56.212 --> 19:57.978
Claire told you, didn't she?

20:00.564 --> 20:02.642
I really don't want to talk about it.

20:03.408 --> 20:04.799
That's cool.

20:10.738 --> 20:12.658
My mom was so pretty.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.074

Well, well, well,

20:45.823 --> 20:49.048
Cinderella, your pumpkin just
left with his shoes in his hand.

20:49.827 --> 20:51.142
Yeah.

20:51.947 --> 20:54.950
We can't go to the
Tuesday meeting anymore.
