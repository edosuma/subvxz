00:56.490 --> 00:58.526
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER): Poor
little bird, they probably

00:58.559 --> 01:01.129
hung up by your
toes in a dark room

01:01.162 --> 01:04.498
somewhere till it was
time to cut off your head.

01:04.532 --> 01:07.468
Well, stop complaining.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.670
My headache is just beginning.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.339
Here I am, 5 o'clock
in the morning,

01:11.372 --> 01:13.941
stuffing bread crumbs
up a dead bird's butt.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.280
[knocking]

01:19.313 --> 01:21.682
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER): Oh,
there's your Aunt Jackie, now.

01:21.715 --> 01:25.686
ten bucks she forgot
your cranberry sauce.

01:25.719 --> 01:26.587
Hi.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.756
I'm not up yet.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.492
I drove over here in first gear.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.893
Did you bring.

01:38.966 --> 01:41.101
One can for 12 people?

01:41.135 --> 01:43.704
Well I won't have any.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.206
[whining]

01:45.239 --> 01:46.940
Want me to go
back to the store?

01:46.974 --> 01:48.309
I'll go back now.

01:48.342 --> 01:51.379
No, no, when mom calls her
for the 20th time to see what

01:51.412 --> 01:52.513
she can bring,
I'll just tell her.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.682
It'll make her day.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.250
There you go.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.551
You know, I was
thinking of inviting

01:57.585 --> 01:58.519
somebody over this afternoon.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.420
For what?

01:59.453 --> 02:01.255
You know.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.790
So mom will think
you're seeing somebody

02:02.823 --> 02:03.991
and get off your case?

02:04.024 --> 02:04.958
Yes.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.927
And if she starts
with me today--

02:06.960 --> 02:08.028
Well don't let her.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.297
And don't you start
with her neither.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.964
I don't start with her.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.733
You start with her constantly.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.236
And you constantly
take her side.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.538
Whenever you're around mom,
you turn into a spineless,

02:17.571 --> 02:18.739
cowering wimp.

02:18.772 --> 02:19.873
Oh. please.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.410
You're a wimp, Roseanne,
wimp, wimp, wimp.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.111
Hey, hey, hey.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.013
At least I have a
relationship with mom.

02:26.046 --> 02:28.316
Oh, here we go.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.018
You didn't even call
her on her birthday.

02:31.051 --> 02:32.586
You sound just like her.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.388
You don't call.
You don't write.

02:34.422 --> 02:36.724
You never tell me
what's going on.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.760
What's going on?

02:39.793 --> 02:42.996
Nothing Go back to sleep.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.232
I heard all the helling.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.667
I thought maybe your
parents got here.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.503
[music playing]

02:52.840 --> 02:55.042
[phone rings]
BECKY: I'll get it.

02:55.075 --> 02:55.943
It's Jimmy.

02:55.976 --> 02:56.844
Hello.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.779
Oh, hi, Grandma.

02:58.812 --> 02:59.680
Yes, she's right here.

03:07.655 --> 03:10.724
Oh, hi, ma.

03:10.758 --> 03:13.026
Yeah, yeah, as a matter
of fact, you can.

03:13.060 --> 03:18.599
You could pick me up two
cans of that cranberry sauce.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.434
You know the jelly kind
that comes in a can

03:20.468 --> 03:22.903
like we have ever year.

03:22.936 --> 03:26.106
Yeah, Jackie comes over and
brings one for 12 people,

03:26.139 --> 03:29.142
and it's all dented.

03:29.176 --> 03:31.345
Yeah, no, no, I don't
need a gravy boat,

03:31.379 --> 03:33.347
just the cranberry sauce, ma.

03:33.381 --> 03:34.782
No, just the cranberry sauce.

03:34.815 --> 03:37.618
No, I have rolls, ma.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.519
Mom.

03:38.552 --> 03:42.923
Mom, just the cranberry sauce.

03:42.956 --> 03:46.159
OK, thanks.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.828
The six is
starting to come off.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.097
Good, then I can
burn that shirt.

03:50.130 --> 03:50.931
Shirt.

03:54.302 --> 03:55.636
She calls it a shirt.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.439
This Jersey happens to
represent tradition.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.708
Yes 17 years of
you rolling around

04:00.741 --> 04:05.313
in the mud like a great big old
hog everything Thanksgiving.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.915
I think the question here
today is can Damaging Dan

04:07.948 --> 04:12.453
Conner stop the wanted passing
attack of one Dr. Zach Bierman?

04:12.486 --> 04:14.322
I think I can.

04:18.326 --> 04:21.795
Well, maybe you
can warm up, you

04:21.829 --> 04:23.964
know, start by moving to
couch a couple feet so I

04:23.997 --> 04:25.666
can set up the kids' table.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.801
Right, right,
right, right, hut.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.315
Hey, I meed you to do that
to my mom later on today.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.784
I'd love too.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.586
I also need you to
go out to the garage,

04:45.619 --> 04:49.222
bring in a couple chairs,
you know, and wipe them off.

04:49.256 --> 04:54.728
OK, Becky, Darlene,
Sis, let's go.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.896
OK, I'm ready.

04:55.929 --> 04:56.897
What do you want me to do?

04:56.930 --> 04:59.900
I'll tell you
what I don't want.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.769
I just don't think today is
a good day for you to drop

05:01.802 --> 05:03.170
the bomb about you being a cop.

05:03.203 --> 05:04.872
Why not?

05:04.905 --> 05:06.774
Because I don't want to
see mom drop dead of a heart

05:06.807 --> 05:08.041
attack at the dinner table.

05:08.075 --> 05:08.876
Why not?

05:11.712 --> 05:13.180
Wish me luck.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.081
OK.

05:14.114 --> 05:14.982
Hi 'em high.

05:15.015 --> 05:15.883
Hit 'em low.

05:15.916 --> 05:19.186
Bring me back some ice.

05:19.219 --> 05:22.723
JACKIE: Roseanne,
why shouldn't I tell

05:22.756 --> 05:24.324
mom about me becoming a cop.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.059
She's always complaining
that I never tell

05:26.093 --> 05:28.496
her what's going on in my life.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.665
Oh, Jackie, please, I just
want, like, one Thanksgiving

05:31.699 --> 05:33.701
without all the insanity.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.469
How are you going
to avoid that?

05:35.503 --> 05:37.204
They're going to
be here for 24--

05:37.237 --> 05:42.910
count them-- 24
mind numbing hour?

05:42.943 --> 05:45.145
Because I'm taking care of it.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.013
They're staying in a motel.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.085
No.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.455
Three weeks ago I
made them a reservation

05:54.488 --> 05:56.724
at the Lanford Motel.

05:56.757 --> 05:59.693
No.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.729
I requested a padded
room with a view.

06:05.232 --> 06:08.669
What did mom say?

06:08.702 --> 06:10.237
Well, I haven't--

06:10.270 --> 06:11.739
Didn't exactly tell her yet.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.610
DARLENE: They're here.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.078
They're here.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.513
BECKY: Grandma kiss alert.

06:19.547 --> 06:22.916
Get your favorite
towels ready.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.652
I'm going to go
check the turkey.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.486
Chicken.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.965
Mom, dad, sis.

06:37.998 --> 06:38.799
Hey.

06:41.535 --> 06:42.670
How are you, darling.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.104
This is for you.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.005
Oh, fine.

06:45.038 --> 06:46.406
Look at my girls.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.808
They're practically women.

06:52.780 --> 06:57.117
Jackie, get out here.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.320
Hello, Jackie.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.154
Hi, Mom.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.360
So you guys need any help
bringing in the bags?

07:07.394 --> 07:08.729
Yeah.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.065
No, that's right, We'll just
hold on the bags for later.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.433
Can I get you guys a drink?

07:13.467 --> 07:14.935
No, I need a
couple of aspirin.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.036
I'll get that.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.137
What's wrong?

07:17.170 --> 07:18.639
What's wrong is I spent
two hours in the car

07:18.672 --> 07:19.840
with this woman.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.242
And every exit we pass
in the entire interstate,

07:22.275 --> 07:24.444
she says to me, you
don't want that exit.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.619
Sometimes he
takes a wrong turn.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.420
What happened to
your sister's hair?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.321
Nothing.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.188
What happened to your hair?

07:38.191 --> 07:40.127
Are you basting
every half hour.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.831
If you don't baste every half
hour, the meat will dry out.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.266
You're cooking it breast up?

07:46.299 --> 07:48.702
Yeah we're cooking
it breast up.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.170
That's OK.

07:50.203 --> 07:53.674
Well, it won't be as juicy.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.575
What did you buy?

07:54.608 --> 07:55.776
25 pounds.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.677
30.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.112
Hm, looks small for 30.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.748
Maybe you should climb
in there and weigh it.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.492
How many people are we?

08:12.526 --> 08:13.894
13.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.095
Let's see.

08:15.128 --> 08:20.267
There's us four, Dan, four
kids, Crystal, Audrey.

08:20.300 --> 08:21.669
Audrey?

08:21.702 --> 08:24.905
Good lord, we haven't seen her
in, gosh, how long has it been,

08:24.938 --> 08:25.806
Al?

08:25.839 --> 08:28.676
8 year, 4 months, and 3 days.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.111
Really?

08:31.144 --> 08:33.747
So you didn't invite anyone?

08:33.781 --> 08:35.716
No, you know me, mom.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.619
All my boyfriend's like to spend
Thanksgiving with their wives.

08:44.424 --> 08:47.327
Come on you, two, stop it.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.295
Stop what?

08:48.328 --> 08:49.296
You're talking.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.764
How you doing?

08:50.798 --> 08:51.732
Everybody's in the kitchen.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.602
Look who I found

08:54.635 --> 08:56.169
It's good to see you.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.270
How you doing.
Hi, Viv.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.538
Jackie.
Gorgeous.

08:58.572 --> 08:59.673
How you doing?

08:59.707 --> 09:04.311
I'm doing fine, you
great big hunk of charm.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.545
Where are the kids?

09:05.579 --> 09:06.747
Well, DJ is out in the garage.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.348
And the girls are
hiding out upstairs.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.416
Watch this.

09:09.449 --> 09:11.551
Hey, kids, I got
nothing for you.

09:11.585 --> 09:16.389
DJ, grandma and
grandpa are here.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.725
My mom here yet?

09:17.758 --> 09:21.428
No, but your dad's here.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.231
Maybe I should get
cleaned you first.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.934
Oh, at least come in
and say hello first.

09:26.967 --> 09:27.835
Hello.

09:27.868 --> 09:30.070
Danny, come here.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.272
Darlene, this is for you.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.174
Grandpa, you want
to see my fort?

09:34.207 --> 09:35.408
Of course, I want
to see your fort.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.576
Why do you think
come around here?

09:36.610 --> 09:37.477
To give you presents?

09:37.510 --> 09:38.712
Ah, ah, ah, no, no, no.

09:38.746 --> 09:39.947
This one is yours.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.448
And you have to figure
out what it does.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.349
OK?

09:42.382 --> 09:44.918
Danny, whoa.

09:44.952 --> 09:45.886
How you doing, son?

09:45.919 --> 09:46.920
I'm good, dad.
How you doing?

09:46.954 --> 09:47.988
I'm good.
I'm good.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.156
I'm good.
I hear your mother is coming.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.558
Yeah, Roseanne thought
it would be a good idea.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.827
Yeah, well, how's she doing?

09:53.861 --> 09:54.828
She's great.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.197
The travel agency
is really booming.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.900
Your mother is working
as a travel agent now?

09:59.933 --> 10:03.070
Dad she started her
own agency two years ago.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.237
Good for her.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.538
Well, I think it's a good idea.

10:05.572 --> 10:08.541
She shouldn't spend
Thanksgiving alone.

10:08.575 --> 10:09.910
Becky, we got a Becky here.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.311
[door bell rings]

10:11.344 --> 10:12.512
It's open.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.514
Hello, hello.

10:14.547 --> 10:15.983
Hi, mom.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.885
Happy Thanksgiving, Audrey.

10:17.918 --> 10:18.819
Hello, Ed.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.688
How are you?

10:20.721 --> 10:24.624
Roseanne there's my girl.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.426
Hi, sweetheart.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.396
Oh, Rose, I got to
apologize up front.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.463
I've brought a date.

10:30.497 --> 10:31.999
And I didn't even ask first.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.300
Well, what's he look like?

10:36.269 --> 10:39.172
Uh-- Audrey--

10:39.206 --> 10:41.408
Everyone, I'd like
you to meet my friend.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.010
Jay Bryant.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.712
Jay this is my family.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.914
I hope you don't mind an
extra person for dinner.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.115
Oh, no, not at all.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.216
Nice to meet you.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.417
Pleasure is mine.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.119
Obviously, you've never
dined with us before.

10:56.156 --> 11:01.394
Rosie, I want you to
do something that would

11:01.428 --> 11:03.697
make your father very happy.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.733
You should ask him
to carve the turkey.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.076
How you boys doing in here?

11:16.109 --> 11:18.111
Much better now
that you are here.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.613
Well, thank you, Ed.

11:20.647 --> 11:21.915
Can I get anyone a drink?

11:21.949 --> 11:22.983
Not me, honey.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.251
I'm going to start
watching this figure.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.185
I'll take one, honey.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.920
I'll have another
bourbon neat.

11:26.954 --> 11:28.588
Vodka rocks would
be much appreciated.

11:28.621 --> 11:29.689
Good enough.

11:29.723 --> 11:30.590
You need a hand, Crystal?

11:30.623 --> 11:32.059
She's got one.

11:32.092 --> 11:34.161
I remember when she was
just a skinny little kid.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.163
She's filled out
nice, though, huh Danny?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.364
Did I meet her husband?

11:37.397 --> 11:38.265
She's divorced.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.167
Twice and widowed.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.534
You know, I don't
think a man was

11:41.568 --> 11:44.304
meant to be married to the
same woman all of his life.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.339
38 years in May.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.775
But I'm not a man.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.476
I'm a robot.

11:49.509 --> 11:52.379
[music playing]

11:54.948 --> 11:57.785
You know, I think Maine
is the prettiest spot

11:57.818 --> 11:59.686
on the face of this Earth.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.488
Have you ever been there?

12:01.521 --> 12:02.389
No, I never have.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.523
Nothing, I'm just saying.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.058
I know, but I want to
know why you're saying.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.860
I want to know why
you're sitting here

12:06.894 --> 12:09.062
talking to me about Kim Green.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.398
Rose, why is she
losing her temper?

12:11.431 --> 12:12.299
I don't know, mom.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.767
Maybe you're driving her nuts

12:13.801 --> 12:15.502
I just want to know
what is the point

12:15.535 --> 12:18.505
of telling me that Kim Green
is married with three kids.

12:18.538 --> 12:19.672
What's it mean?

12:19.706 --> 12:21.341
It means that she
had sex at least three

12:21.374 --> 12:22.409
times since she's been married.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.677
And he wanted to sit with us.

12:24.711 --> 12:25.578
Major body odor.

12:25.612 --> 12:26.814
Twice if she had twins.

12:26.847 --> 12:27.815
Or once if she had triplets.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.582
Al, you're being filthy.

12:29.616 --> 12:30.851
Or it's possible
they never had sex

12:30.884 --> 12:32.319
and your mother is making
up this whole thing.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.624
Why you're reading
so much into.

12:37.657 --> 12:40.227
I just told you a simple fact.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.095
If you want to waste
your life living

12:42.129 --> 12:43.363
alone and working in a bar.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.331
Fine.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.566
I'm not here to
tell you what to do.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.401
I'm not wasting my life, mom.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.171
I just spent six weeks at
the police training academy

12:51.204 --> 12:52.205
in Springfield.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.173
Springfield?

12:53.206 --> 12:54.274
What were you doing
in Springfield?

12:54.307 --> 12:57.144
What did you need, tires?

12:57.177 --> 12:59.712
No I was becoming a cop.

12:59.746 --> 13:02.149
And I am now a
rookie police woman

13:02.182 --> 13:03.817
for the Lanford police force.

13:03.851 --> 13:06.119
Did you hear that?

13:06.153 --> 13:08.922
Yeah I've been hearing
it my whole life.

13:08.956 --> 13:11.591
What does she
became a police woman?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.660
How could she do
something so impulsive,

13:13.693 --> 13:15.528
so reckless, so dangerous?

13:15.562 --> 13:18.498
She could get killed or maimed.

13:18.531 --> 13:22.669
Roseanne, did you
know about this?

13:22.702 --> 13:25.205
I guess so.

13:25.238 --> 13:27.707
Then why didn't she tell me?

13:27.740 --> 13:29.576
I don't know, ma.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.079
Maybe she thought
you'd take it bad.

13:32.112 --> 13:35.815
You know, I don't think I want
to even talk about it anymore.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.185
[sobs]

13:39.419 --> 13:42.255
Oh, that is just what
I love about our family.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.491
We don't want to
talk about something,

13:44.524 --> 13:46.726
so we bring it up
at the dinner table.

13:46.759 --> 13:47.660
More turkey.

13:51.731 --> 13:55.102
[music playing]

13:58.205 --> 14:01.008
Come on, DJ, hurry up.

14:01.041 --> 14:04.011
I can hardly
keep my eyes open.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.345
There's some kind of
chemical in Turkey.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.613
Uh--
- Tryptophan.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.615
God, that puts you to sleep.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.050
Yeah, it can't
be them four beers.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.819
Hey, I ain't driving anywhere.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.255
I am going to explode.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.657
Would you like me to make you
nice little turkey sandwich?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.292
No

14:19.326 --> 14:22.229
How can you even
talk about food?

14:22.262 --> 14:24.097
Because I don't feel
like talking about sex.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.032
And what else is there?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.241
How are you doing, sweetheart?

14:34.274 --> 14:36.910
I'm doing real
good, mama, real good.

14:36.944 --> 14:38.311
How's business?

14:38.345 --> 14:41.114
Pretty good.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.749
What do you think of Jay.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.187
I think whatever
makes you happy.

14:49.789 --> 14:50.823
You make me happy.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.764
Lose 50 pounds
and cut your hair.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.569
See you later, Mr. Conner.

15:02.602 --> 15:03.603
Thanks for having me.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.072
OK, Jim.
Get home safe.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.006
All right.

15:06.039 --> 15:06.873
Bye.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.708
Bye.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.945
Rose, I think that
Jimmy fella is nice.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.713
What sort of name is Meltrieger?

15:13.746 --> 15:14.982
Is he Episcopalian?

15:21.421 --> 15:24.257
Well he seems like a good boy.

15:24.291 --> 15:28.028
Maybe he has an older
brother for your sister.

15:28.061 --> 15:31.064
Hey, little lady,
let me do that.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.799
Oh, thanks, Ed.

15:32.832 --> 15:34.134
Lonnie, let's go.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.371
You leaving already, Christal?

15:38.405 --> 15:39.306
Well, your family is here.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.308
You need to visit.

15:41.341 --> 15:44.077
Everything was just so good.

15:44.111 --> 15:46.713
Honey, will you help
me with the chairs?

15:46.746 --> 15:47.680
We got 'em.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.182
I got this table.

15:49.216 --> 15:50.650
Oh, that's real sweet, Ed.

15:50.683 --> 15:51.551
Bye now.

15:51.584 --> 15:52.419
Bye bye.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.293
Nice seeing you, Ed.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.828
Yeah, you too, honey.

16:01.861 --> 16:06.133
Look, this guy
treating you right?

16:06.166 --> 16:08.768
Compared to who?

16:08.801 --> 16:12.872
Yeah, well, I better
try to catch up.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.814
Daniel, Rose,
we're going to leave.

16:21.848 --> 16:23.083
We're going to shove off now.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.451
We loved it.

16:24.484 --> 16:25.585
It was so nice
to see you again.

16:25.618 --> 16:26.853
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Yeah.

16:26.886 --> 16:27.754
Take care.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.057
Good meeting you, man.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.124
Bye.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.025
It was great.

16:32.059 --> 16:32.925
Thanks a lot.

16:32.959 --> 16:33.926
Oh, you're very welcome.

16:33.960 --> 16:34.994
Nice to meet you.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.496
Well, I'll walk you
guys out to the car.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.864
Al, give Dan our keys.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.199
He can bring our bags in.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.179
Wait a second.

16:54.914 --> 16:58.318
Dan thinks-- so.

16:58.351 --> 17:03.923
Dan and I think a motel makes
more sense for everyone.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.462
I'm going to go
take out the trash.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.603
I made reservations for
you at the Lanford Motel.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.838
A motel?

17:18.871 --> 17:20.640
I thought you were kidding.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.243
Oh, that's where
Jay and I are staying.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.378
Maybe we'll have
breakfast together.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.279
Bye, sweetheart.

17:26.313 --> 17:29.516
Bye, mom, see you tomorrow.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.618
Roseanne, if you didn't
want us to stay over,

17:31.651 --> 17:35.188
why didn't you
just say something?

17:35.222 --> 17:37.457
Well I tried.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.859
This is so last minute.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.595
I would have packed a
different night gown.

17:42.629 --> 17:43.663
She's like a ballplayer.

17:43.696 --> 17:44.931
She has home and away uniforms.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.970
Well, I just hope the
heat works in this motel.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.839
Your father has been
fighting the flu.

17:52.872 --> 17:56.776
Well, you guys, don't have
to go right now, do you?

17:56.809 --> 17:59.346
Would you like to
have more coffee?

17:59.379 --> 18:01.914
As it is, I'm not going
to be able to sleep.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.783
I hate motels.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.119
But that's OK.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.054
Come on, honey.
You'll have a hot bath.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.356
And I'll read the
newspaper to you.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.659
And then you can
keep me up all night.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.093
Are you guys one your way?

18:14.127 --> 18:15.595
We're going to a motel.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.097
Good choice.

18:18.131 --> 18:21.168
Hey, Danny, look, I'm going to
see you guys tomorrow, right?

18:21.201 --> 18:22.602
What are you doing?
You taking off?

18:22.635 --> 18:23.903
I'm just going
down to Chrissie's.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.938
You know, help her and the
kids in with that furniture.

18:25.972 --> 18:27.774
You coming back?

18:27.807 --> 18:29.242
I don't know.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.543
What are you doing, dad?

18:30.577 --> 18:31.378
What do you mean?

18:34.514 --> 18:37.116
Why don't you just
leave Crystal alone?

18:37.150 --> 18:39.018
Why?

18:39.051 --> 18:41.821
Because I asked you to?

18:41.854 --> 18:44.991
You got something
going on with her?

18:45.024 --> 18:47.594
Is that supposed to be funny?

18:47.627 --> 18:49.696
Are we talking man
to man here or what?

18:49.729 --> 18:50.763
Hey, I'm a married man.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.266
Well I am not a married
man at the moment.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.568
And being alone is lot for
two people to have in common.

18:59.105 --> 19:02.175
You don't know anything
about that, son.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.343
And I hope to God you never do.

19:07.714 --> 19:08.615
See you tomorrow?

19:08.648 --> 19:11.484
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

19:19.859 --> 19:20.760
Are you OK?

19:24.297 --> 19:25.164
Yeah, I'm OK.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.099
How you doing?

19:27.133 --> 19:30.102
I think I'm OK.

19:30.136 --> 19:33.105
You know, I got
a crush on you.

19:33.139 --> 19:33.940
You better.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.719
Are they gone?

19:46.753 --> 19:47.620
Yes.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.422
They're gone, you cowering wimp.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.193
You want me to help
you with the kitchen?

19:54.227 --> 19:55.295
No.

19:55.328 --> 19:56.563
I'm not going to do
nothing till tomorrow

19:56.596 --> 19:57.530
because I'm just exhausted.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.965
OK.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.132
I'll see you in the morning.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.033
Yeah.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.235
What time?

20:02.269 --> 20:06.473
Um-- si-- noon, OK?

20:06.506 --> 20:07.774
Yeah, OK.

20:07.807 --> 20:08.808
All right.

20:08.841 --> 20:10.176
You want me to pick
you up some stuff?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.478
No I'll see you
in the morning.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.051
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER): How
could I send them to a motel?

20:19.085 --> 20:22.188
No, I can't think like that,
or I'll just drive myself crazy

20:22.221 --> 20:24.524
and finish that pumpkin
pie in the refrigerator.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.433
ROSEANNE (VOICEOVER): Look at
them in there, lying around

20:33.466 --> 20:34.901
like a bunch of beached whales.

20:38.971 --> 20:39.839
In their own mind.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.977
And for this, I'm
truly thankful.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.285
Of course, I'd trade any one
of them for a dishwasher.

20:56.489 --> 20:58.024
How you doing, birdie?

20:58.057 --> 21:00.293
You look like I feel.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.067
VIV: What does she mean
she became a policewoman?

21:08.100 --> 21:09.869
How could she do
something so impulsive,

21:09.902 --> 21:11.504
so reckless, so dangerous.

21:11.538 --> 21:14.206
She could get killed and maimed.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.976
Roseanne, did you
know about this?

21:17.009 --> 21:18.645
ROSEANNE: Yeah, I guess.

21:18.678 --> 21:21.113
VIV: Then why
didn't she tell me?

21:21.147 --> 21:22.214
ROSEANNE: I don't know, ma.

21:22.248 --> 21:24.751
Maybe she thought
you'd take it bad.
