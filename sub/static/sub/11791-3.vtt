FIRST, JULIA MOVES TO LESBAYNIA.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.702
THEN BACHELORETTE NUMBER TWO--

10:09.710 --> 10:12.133
>> JULIA IS JUST A TOURIST.

10:12.140 --> 10:13.835
SHE HASNT TAKEN UP RESIDENCY,

10:13.840 --> 10:18.106
AND I DONT THINK SHE PLANS TO.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.077
>> I THOUGHT SHE HAD THE HOTS

10:19.080 --> 10:21.184
FOR THAT OLLY CHICK.

10:28.850 --> 10:30.249
>> RIGHT NOW, OLIVIA IS

10:30.260 --> 10:31.989
SOMETHING DANGEROUS AND NEW,

10:32.000 --> 10:32.989
MORE SATISFYING THAN WHAT SHE

10:33.000 --> 10:34.126
HAD WITH SEAN, BUT THIS ISNT IT

10:34.130 --> 10:35.825
FOR HER.

10:35.830 --> 10:36.922
YOU CAN SEE THAT EVERY TIME

10:36.930 --> 10:40.058
OLIVIA TOUCHES HER.

10:40.070 --> 10:41.765
>> POOR SEAN.

10:41.770 --> 10:42.964
I TELL YOU, THAT JULIA KEEPS YOU

10:42.970 --> 10:44.733
GUESSING, DONT SHE?

10:44.740 --> 10:45.832
AT LEAST SHE DOESNT SHIT IN THE

10:45.840 --> 10:47.068
HOT TUB.

10:50.020 --> 10:52.079

11:15.840 --> 11:18.832
>> OLD ENOUGH. I JUST TURNED 18.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.979
>> UH-HUH. IS YOUR MOTHER OR

11:20.980 --> 11:23.278
FATHER GOING TO BE PRESENT?

11:23.280 --> 11:24.804
I DONT PERFORM SURGICAL

11:24.810 --> 11:27.699
PROCEDURES ON ANYONE UNDER 21

11:27.710 --> 11:30.884
WITHOUT PARENTAL APPROVAL.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.084
>> WELL, MY FATHER IS NOT REALLY

11:32.090 --> 11:35.856
IN THE PICTURE ANYMORE, AND ID

11:35.860 --> 11:36.918
BE TOO EMBARRASSED TO TALK ABOUT

11:36.920 --> 11:40.162

11:49.940 --> 11:52.932
I COULD FEEL IT RIP DEEP INSIDE.

11:52.940 --> 11:57.707
I WANT YOU TO RECONSTRUCT IT.

11:57.710 --> 11:58.802
>> WELL, WHY DONT WE CALL

11:58.810 --> 12:00.789
YOUR MOTHER AND JUST TALK TO HER

12:00.790 --> 12:01.814
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM?

12:01.820 --> 12:03.845
>> IM STILL A VIRGIN, OK, AND I

12:03.850 --> 12:04.817
WANT TO DECIDE WHO TO GIVE IT

12:04.820 --> 12:05.912

AS THEY GET TO STICK IT IN

12:15.760 --> 12:17.899
SOMEWHERE, BUT YOUR VIRGINITY,

12:17.900 --> 12:20.039
THATS A SACRED HOLE.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.064
ITS A GIFT YOU GIVE TO SOMEONE

12:21.070 --> 12:22.833
YOU CARE ABOUT.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.866
>> YOU KNOW, IM NOT COMFORTABLE

12:25.870 --> 12:27.132
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION WITHOUT

12:27.140 --> 12:30.268
A PARENT PRESENT.

12:30.280 --> 12:31.269
>> IS THAT WHY YOURE SQUIRMING

12:31.280 --> 12:33.976
AROUND LIKE THAT, BECAUSE YOURE

12:33.980 --> 12:37.313
NOT COMFORTABLE, OR ARE YOU

12:37.320 --> 12:39.880

12:58.540 --> 13:00.201
MY ASS.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.542
2 OUT OF 3 IS NOT BAD, RIGHT?

13:06.280 --> 13:10.182
MAYBE ANOTHER TIME.

13:10.190 --> 13:11.885
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

13:11.890 --> 13:12.857
YOURE EVEN HO'I'TER THAN YOU ARE

13:12.860 --> 13:14.452

JEANS AND SOME BIRKENSTOCKS, AND

13:49.590 --> 13:50.522
YOURE GOOD TO GO, RIGHT?

13:50.530 --> 13:51.292
>> HA HA.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.324
>> WHATS THIS THAT YOURE

13:52.330 --> 13:54.195

13:54.200 --> 13:55.428
WOW, YOU NEED A HOW-TO BOOK.

13:55.430 --> 13:56.328
I THOUGHT THIS KIND OF STUFF

13:56.330 --> 13:57.194
JUST CAME NATURALLY.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.326
THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.

13:58.330 --> 13:59.592

14:05.570 --> 14:07.936
>> CHRISTIAN, DO YOU HAVE A

14:07.940 --> 14:09.919
PROBLEM WITH MY SEXUALITY?

14:09.920 --> 14:10.909
>> IVE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM

14:10.920 --> 14:11.978
WITH YOUR SEXUALITY, AND YOUVE

14:11.980 --> 14:13.242
ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM WITH MINE.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.547
>> THAT MAY HAVE BEEN TRUE ONCE,

14:14.550 --> 14:16.074
BUT NOT ANY MORE.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.012
>> WHY, BECAUSE YOURE A

14:17.020 --> 14:17.975
LESBIAN?

14:17.980 --> 14:19.538
>> NO. BECAUSE IM IN LOVE WITH

14:19.550 --> 14:20.528
OLIVIA.

14:20.530 --> 14:21.519

14:21.530 --> 14:22.485
FOR THE FIRST, TIME WE HAVE THE

14:22.490 --> 14:23.889
OPPORTUNITY TO TELL EACH OTHER

14:23.890 --> 14:25.551
HOW WE FEEL, AND YOU PULL THIS

14:25.560 --> 14:26.925
LESBIAN CRAP.

14:26.930 --> 14:29.080
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

14:29.090 --> 14:30.296
YOU THINK IM WITH A WOMAN

14:30.300 --> 14:32.029
BECAUSE OF YOU?

14:32.040 --> 14:33.268
>> I THINK YOURE WITH A WOMAN

14:33.270 --> 14:34.567
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN, YOU REALIZED

14:34.570 --> 14:35.594
THAT YOU CANT FALL IN LOVE WITH

14:35.600 --> 14:36.567
ANOTHER MAN.

14:36.570 --> 14:38.162
>> YOUR EGO IS SO HUGE, ITS A

14:38.170 --> 14:39.296
WONDER YOUR HEAD DOESNT

14:39.300 --> 14:40.346
EXPLODE.

14:40.350 --> 14:41.305
>> ITS THE ONLY THING BIGGER

14:41.310 --> 14:44.507
THAN MY COCK, IF YOU RECALL.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.649
OR DO MEN DISGUST YOU NOW?

14:46.650 --> 14:50.609
>> OHH...YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:50.620 --> 14:53.111
I AM GAY, CHRISTIAN.

14:53.120 --> 14:54.519
I FEEL LIKE IM BEING AUTHENTIC

14:54.520 --> 14:56.317
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.309

14:57.320 --> 15:00.528
AUTH ENTIC?

15:00.530 --> 15:04.261
>> WHAT WE HAD WAS EXCITING AND

15:04.270 --> 15:08.297
ILLICIT AND FULL OF FANTASY.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.109
>> MM-HMM.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.135
>> OH, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO

15:12.140 --> 15:13.277
WITH YOU.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.498
ITS JUST THAT WOMEN HAVE A

15:15.510 --> 15:17.933
GREATER LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY.

15:17.940 --> 15:20.511
>> SENSITIVITY, MY ASS.

15:23.250 --> 15:26.242
REMEMBER HOW THIS FELT, HUH?

15:26.250 --> 15:28.684
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE?

15:28.690 --> 15:30.157

ADMIT IT.

15:32.100 --> 15:34.591
LET ME MAKE LOVE TO YOU.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.555
WHATS THE WORST THAT CAN

15:35.560 --> 15:37.949
HAPPEN, HUH, THAT IM RIGHT,

15:37.960 --> 15:39.029
THAT WE STOP RUNNING?

15:39.030 --> 15:41.533
>> DAMN IT, CHRISTIAN!

15:41.540 --> 15:43.565
OH, YOU WANT HONESTY?

15:43.570 --> 15:44.707
YOU CANT STAND THE FACT THAT I

15:44.710 --> 15:46.564
AM HAPPY WITHOUT YOU, THAT IM

15:46.570 --> 15:50.711
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

15:50.720 --> 15:51.675
>> YOU KEEP LYING TO YOURSELF,

15:51.680 --> 15:53.318
SWEETIE PIE.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.241
ONE DAY, THE NOVELTY WILL WEAR

15:54.250 --> 15:57.139
OFF, AND YOULL REALIZE YOU

15:57.150 --> 15:58.242

16:00.590 --> 16:01.557
OLIVIA IS A NICE PIECE OF

16:01.560 --> 16:03.528
ASS, BUT SHE CAN NEVER GET

16:03.530 --> 16:06.454
INSIDE YOU THE WAY THAT I CAN.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.199
>> SO, THIS IS NICE, HUH?

16:24.210 --> 16:25.302
KIND OF LIKE BEING BACK IN

16:25.310 --> 16:27.540
FLORIDA.

16:27.550 --> 16:29.541
HOWS SCHOOL GOING?

16:29.550 --> 16:30.710
MOM SAYS ITS A LITTLE BIT OF AN

16:30.720 --> 16:32.153
ADJUSTMENT JUST BECAUSE

16:32.160 --> 16:33.252
EVERYTHING IS NEW, WHICH IS

16:33.260 --> 16:36.218
TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE.

16:36.220 --> 16:38.609
>> I WANT TO COME LIVE WITH YOU.

16:38.620 --> 16:41.293
>> OH, SWEETIE, IT TAKES TIME.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.289
YOU DONT KNOW ANY OF THE KIDS

16:42.300 --> 16:43.665

16:43.670 --> 16:45.160
>> ITS NOT THE SCHOOL.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.058
ITS MOM.

16:47.070 --> 16:49.061
>> HER BEING GAY?

16:53.680 --> 16:54.772
ITS PRETTY NEW FOR HER, TOO,

16:54.780 --> 16:57.772
YOU KNOW?

16:57.780 --> 16:59.634
>> I JUST WANT TO LIVE HERE WITH

16:59.640 --> 17:02.279
YOU.

17:25.770 --> 17:29.706
>> CAN I, DADDY?

17:29.710 --> 17:32.713
>> HOW ABOUT I TALK IT OVER WITH

17:32.720 --> 17:34.176
YOUR MOM, AND THEN WELL SEE,

17:34.180 --> 17:37.115
OK?

17:43.660 --> 17:44.729
>> SOMETIMES WHEN THINGS ARE

17:44.730 --> 17:46.357
DIFFERENT, YOU JUST HAVE TO GET

17:46.360 --> 17:47.657
USED TO THEM.

17:47.660 --> 17:48.820
THEN THEYRE NOT SO BAD, YOU

17:48.830 --> 17:50.297
