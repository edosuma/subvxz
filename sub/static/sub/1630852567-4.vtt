Dennis: Dr. Thompson wants us
to fill one out

00:04.238 --> 00:06.271
After any contact we have.

00:06.273 --> 00:07.873
- I had his back,
he had mine.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.974
- That's not what
detective abed said

00:10.011 --> 00:11.577
In his report
to professional standards.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.111
(gunshot blasts, shell clinks)

00:14.782 --> 00:16.682

00:18.452 --> 00:20.085
(vase shatters)

00:20.121 --> 00:21.853
- (breathes heavily)

00:21.989 --> 00:23.388
- Sharing information
with police officers

00:23.424 --> 00:25.591
And talking to family
isn't bias.

00:25.726 --> 00:28.127
- Praying over bodies,
talking to a survivor?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.795
Oh, I'm concerned you
are blurring the lines.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.887
- Mom?

00:55.956 --> 00:59.424
How are we out of lettuce?
Mom?!

00:59.493 --> 01:01.860
- Yeah?
- How are we out of lettuce?

01:01.995 --> 01:03.295
- What?

01:04.365 --> 01:06.065
- Oh, what are you doing?

01:06.200 --> 01:09.101
- I'm saving my tomatoes.

01:09.236 --> 01:12.304
- So, is uh... Yeah,
is-is this lettuce?

01:12.306 --> 01:13.939
- You run an online food
kitchen,

01:13.941 --> 01:15.407
And you don't know
what lettuce looks like?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.843
- Not when it's in the ground.
- Grab it by the stem.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.645
- (clears throat)
- whoa, hey, that is a cabbage!

01:19.647 --> 01:21.679
That's a cabbage, that is...

01:22.716 --> 01:24.316
Here, back up.
- No.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.118
- Yes.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.187
Here.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.922
You ever uh...

01:30.958 --> 01:33.191
You ever think about going
to culinary school?

01:33.193 --> 01:35.394
- Culinary school would just
make me like everybody else.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.863
Right, I'm-I'm unique,
I'm self-taught.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.731
- Yeah, but you know,
there's, there is more

01:39.733 --> 01:42.066
To running a business than
just, you know, making a menu.

01:42.103 --> 01:43.335
- I know.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.403
- After all, you did almost
kill my assistant.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.339
- Mom, don't--
(exhales)

01:47.474 --> 01:49.707
Don't worry, okay?
I got this.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.012
(footsteps recede)

01:55.616 --> 01:57.883
- You know parenting
is worrying, right?

01:57.885 --> 01:59.885
It's like watching
your heart walk around

01:59.887 --> 02:01.486
Outside of your body.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.488
- Sounds gross,
and unsustainable.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.825
- It's terrifying.

- hey.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.423
- What do we have here?

03:11.425 --> 03:13.558
- Ten-month-old infant.
Simon.

03:13.594 --> 03:16.295
They tried to resuscitate him
on the way to the hospital,

03:16.430 --> 03:18.430
But, um...

03:18.432 --> 03:20.699
- This job, some days.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.402
Uh, the kitchen was fully
stocked, baby food,

03:24.404 --> 03:25.971
Everything, so...

03:26.106 --> 03:27.506
It looks like simon
and his sister's basic needs

03:27.641 --> 03:29.074
Were taken care of.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.776
- There's no choking hazards
in the crib, either.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.246
- Did you see any signs
of abuse

03:34.315 --> 03:36.114
When you examined the body?

03:36.183 --> 03:37.983
- Uh, well, he was pale
and dehydrated,

03:37.985 --> 03:40.252
But there was no visible
bruising or signs of illness.

03:40.321 --> 03:42.254
- So many of these infant
deaths I've worked

03:42.389 --> 03:44.122
Have been ruled "undetermined."

03:44.258 --> 03:46.391

can be tricky.

03:46.393 --> 03:49.394
Evidence of illness
or injury can be...

03:50.564 --> 03:52.630
Can be subtle.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.535
Max: I need to bring
his giraffe stuffie!

03:56.670 --> 03:58.637
I have to find it!

03:58.772 --> 04:00.339
I need to find it! (sobs)

04:00.341 --> 04:02.207

simon deceased.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.208
- No, he-he can't go anywhere
without it!

04:04.245 --> 04:06.611
(sniffles)
he can't! Just can't.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.347

04:09.349 --> 04:10.482
- Last night.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.285
I-I would-I wouldn't let him
take it in the bath.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.087
I just...

04:15.089 --> 04:16.922
He didn't understand why.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.690
You know that look kids get?

04:18.825 --> 04:20.826
When life is unfair?

04:20.961 --> 04:23.628

Let me help you find it, okay?

04:23.631 --> 04:26.030

04:26.066 --> 04:27.899
(sobs) where is it?

04:28.035 --> 04:29.468
- Do you know who found him?

04:29.603 --> 04:31.169
- His mother.

04:31.238 --> 04:33.004
Max williams.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.106
She manages at her local
grocery store.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.076
- Is there anybody else
in the picture?

04:38.145 --> 04:40.045
She have a partner?
- Single parent.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.446
- (sharp exhale)

04:41.448 --> 04:43.315
Imagine going through
this alone.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.585
- A lot of marriages don't
survive the death of a child.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.454
- Yeah, my parents' didn't.

04:50.957 --> 04:52.990
(footsteps recede)

04:52.992 --> 04:55.927
- Just tell them to wait
until I find simon's giraffe.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.529
Okay?

04:57.531 --> 04:59.698
Why didn't I just let him
bring it in the bath?

04:59.833 --> 05:02.134
- Oh!
- I didn't let him.

05:02.136 --> 05:04.303
- Is this it?
- No, that's a tiger.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.739
(sobs)

05:07.741 --> 05:09.640
- Yeah, it's a tiger.

where is it?

05:29.229 --> 05:30.662
Oh god!

05:30.731 --> 05:32.531
- Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.900
- (sobs quietly)

05:34.902 --> 05:37.502
- What time did you find simon?
- Um...

05:37.504 --> 05:39.971
Maybe 6:30, uh...

05:41.108 --> 05:43.108
Serena and I were reading.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.977
Um, enjoying the, the quiet
before simon woke up.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.847
- Okay.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.715
Do you remember,
was he breathing?

05:50.784 --> 05:52.384
- (sobs quietly)

05:54.521 --> 05:56.121
No.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.055
- And was he warm or was
he cool to the touch?

05:58.092 --> 06:00.926
- He was-he was warm.
- He was warm, okay.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.728
- Oh my god, he was-
he was still so warm.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.296
And when I...

06:06.333 --> 06:07.498
I called the ambulance, but...

06:09.002 --> 06:11.536
The er doctor said...

06:11.572 --> 06:13.638
He said we were too late.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.374
(sobs)

06:15.509 --> 06:17.342
- Max, do you remember,
was he on his back

06:17.344 --> 06:19.144
Or was he on his chest
when you found him?

06:19.146 --> 06:20.745
- (sobs, gasps)

06:20.814 --> 06:22.614
Oh god! Oh, it was me!
Was it--

06:22.749 --> 06:24.883
Did I forget to put him
on his back?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.818
Was that me?
Is that-is that what happened?

06:26.820 --> 06:28.819
Is that what happened?

06:28.821 --> 06:32.057
- Was he sick at all?
- Yes-no. Yes.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.159
No, no.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.093
He had colic.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.829
- Colic? Isn't he a little
old for colic?

06:37.831 --> 06:39.397
- No.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.366
The doctor said
he was within range.

06:41.368 --> 06:42.767
(sobs quietly)

06:42.770 --> 06:44.369
(sirens wail in the distance)

06:44.371 --> 06:45.770
(low hum of distant police
chatter)

06:45.839 --> 06:47.705
- Max?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.841
What time did you put him down?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.610
- Uh... Maybe uh, seven.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.114
- Seven. Okay. And did you
check on him at all?

06:56.116 --> 06:58.517
- No, I don't...

06:58.652 --> 07:00.685
I don't know why I didn't.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.954
No, wait, I did. Um...

07:02.990 --> 07:04.722
I posted about it.

07:06.226 --> 07:07.659
- That's at dinner.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.995
And... That's him asleep.

07:11.331 --> 07:12.464
(sighs)

07:12.599 --> 07:14.765
- May I?
- Yeah.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.741
- The baby has his own
social media account?

07:22.743 --> 07:24.943
- He had a thousand followers.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.345
Um, I wanted to start him early,

07:27.347 --> 07:29.347
So he could have that.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.816
- The time stamp says
7 p.M., but...

07:31.852 --> 07:34.486
Is that when you put him down
or when you checked on him?

07:34.555 --> 07:36.688
- (sighs)
when I checked on him.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.790
(car rumbles up)

07:40.093 --> 07:42.093
- You-you can't be here,
this is a crime scene.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.594
(car shuts off)
okay.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.431
(car door opens, slams shut)

07:46.433 --> 07:47.499
- Cassidy james.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.468
Child welfare agency.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.538
Donovan.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.908
- What are you doing here?

07:56.910 --> 07:58.510
You can't just barge into a
sensitive interview like that.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.845
- Cwa has an open file
on max williams,

08:00.914 --> 08:02.847
I'm surprised you're not more
interested in what we know.

08:02.883 --> 08:05.083
- Okay, just-I know this is
a heated case,

08:05.218 --> 08:07.352
But we just need to pause
for a second.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.020
Why did they open the file?

08:09.056 --> 08:11.522
- Two days ago someone called
in an anonymous tip to cwa

08:11.524 --> 08:13.258
That simon had been crying
for days.

08:13.393 --> 08:14.626
Police did a welfare check,

08:14.761 --> 08:16.895
But left convinced
the baby had colic.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.797
- Okay, we just searched the
scene, and nothing stood out

08:18.932 --> 08:21.332
As suspicious.
- Except that simon is dead.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.502
We can still get serena
to safety.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.537
- There's no proof
that she's at risk.

08:25.606 --> 08:28.139
- Proof is for trial! Cwa needs
to be safe, not sorry.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.908
- Okay, this wouldn't be
the first time

08:29.910 --> 08:31.543
That your agency's profiled
a black family.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.278
- That's not what's
going on here.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.680
All I need is a coroner ruling
of parental neglect.

08:35.815 --> 08:37.949
- Yeah, well, I need to pursue
all evidence.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.751
I mean, there's witness
interviews, medical history,

08:39.753 --> 08:42.019
Autopsy, child welfare.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.889
- If you rule simon's death
accidental and you're wrong,

08:44.958 --> 08:46.958
Serena could be next.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.027
- Well, if I rule neglect
and I'm wrong,

08:49.029 --> 08:51.562
Then I'm gonna re-victimize
a family that's grieving.

08:51.564 --> 08:52.430
I need time.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.433
We need to get this right.
Okay?

08:55.435 --> 08:57.435
There's no room for mistakes.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.503
- Thank you.
Excuse me.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.842
(donovan sighs heavily)

09:04.912 --> 09:06.578
- What was that about?

09:08.649 --> 09:11.382
- (sighs heavily)

09:11.451 --> 09:13.318
Cassidy is...

09:13.320 --> 09:15.053
My ex-wife.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.190
Woman: Here let me just--

09:19.259 --> 09:21.058
Do you like this one?

09:21.094 --> 09:22.594
- (breathing heavily)

09:22.663 --> 09:24.629
I don't know where it is!
I just don't know where it is.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.931
- Hey max, serena shouldn't be
here for this.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.466
- I just--

09:28.468 --> 09:29.901
- Is there somewhere
she can go?

09:30.036 --> 09:31.469
- She's safe with me, and um...

09:31.538 --> 09:33.270
I'm not gonna let her out
of my sight.

09:33.307 --> 09:34.505
- Okay. I know she is, max,

09:34.541 --> 09:36.374
But the child welfare agent
said

09:36.509 --> 09:38.276
That she has to go somewhere
else until we figure out

09:38.345 --> 09:40.078
What happened to simon.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.347
- Child welfare?

09:42.349 --> 09:44.683
No. No!

09:44.685 --> 09:46.751
- Look, is there,
is there someone you trust?

09:46.753 --> 09:49.286
A family member or a friend?

09:50.490 --> 09:52.957
- She's never spent a night
without her brother.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.326
And I'm all she has left.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.630
- Okay. Hey...

09:59.800 --> 10:01.565
Then help me keep her close.

10:04.771 --> 10:07.571
- Uh, andrea, next door.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.175
She baby-sits when I have
to work nights at the store.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.679

Serena: Mommy!

messing up the kids' routine.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.598

do for them.

Both of them.

- And for max?

10:42.476 --> 10:43.875
How do you feel about her?

10:44.010 --> 10:47.745
- I wouldn't raise a child
on social media, personally.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.681
Simon and serena didn't
have much of a say

10:49.750 --> 10:51.816
On whether or not their whole
childhood was public.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.485
It obviously wasn't for them.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.354
- You think max liked
the attention?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.289
- I think what was inside
the pictures

10:58.325 --> 11:01.625
Didn't exactly reflect
what was outside the frame.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.103
- So how'd it go
with the babysitter?

11:12.238 --> 11:14.406
- Oh, she implied that max was
too obsessed with social media

11:14.541 --> 11:15.973
To parent her child.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.710
- It's not exactly a glowing
character reference, huh?

11:18.845 --> 11:21.078
- Ah, people tend to blame
each other during a crisis.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.982
But if simon wasn't getting the
medical attention he needed,

11:23.984 --> 11:25.850
That's a contributing factor.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.919
- See, I don't think that's it.
Look at this.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.388
Max took simon to the doctor
an awful lot.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.057
She would post about
each visit.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.658
She got tons of support online.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.594
Parents would weigh in
with tips and ideas.

11:36.663 --> 11:38.129

with simon?

11:39.933 --> 11:41.999
Trying to crowdsource
a diagnosis?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.935

was getting a hit of dopamine

11:44.070 --> 11:46.303

11:47.474 --> 11:49.106

11:49.108 --> 11:51.009
Jenny'll want simon's
full medical record,

11:51.144 --> 11:52.744
So I'll get her

We don't need to be more

12:24.511 --> 12:27.979

your diagnosis was colic.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.281
- Which I explained
will go away on its own.

12:30.416 --> 12:32.951
- Could simon's colic have been
masking another illness?

12:32.953 --> 12:35.019
- What's going on, detective?

12:36.189 --> 12:38.289
- Simon was found dead
this morning.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.626
- I had no idea.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.661
- We're gonna need to see all
of his medical records,

12:43.730 --> 12:45.496
So that I can determine
cause of death.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.404
- (grunts with effort)

12:53.406 --> 12:56.040
- Are those all for
simon williams?

12:56.076 --> 12:58.475
- He was in here all the time.

12:58.512 --> 13:00.611
I treated him for irritability,

13:00.647 --> 13:03.080
Then lethargy,
then constipation,

13:03.116 --> 13:05.016
All normal baby ailments.

13:05.151 --> 13:07.685
His immune system was more
than a match for.

13:07.754 --> 13:11.623
But max catastrophized
every sneeze and sniffle,

13:11.625 --> 13:13.958
Pushing me for a more
extreme diagnosis.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.628
So I started treating her
for anxiety.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.364
Simon wasn't sick.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.265
Max is.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.735
- What was she like
when she'd come in here?

13:28.241 --> 13:31.141
Try to pass herself off
as medically knowledgeable.

13:32.412 --> 13:35.580
- So you're saying that she was
medically over-involved?

13:37.384 --> 13:40.684
Would she make recommendations
for surgeries,

13:40.720 --> 13:41.886
For treatments?

13:41.922 --> 13:43.588
- Yes.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.390
She was worried about him not
gaining weight fast enough.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.659
I thought she was just
attention starved,

13:48.695 --> 13:50.327

29:13.852 --> 29:16.520
Contamination in one vegetable

29:16.589 --> 29:18.155
Is manageable for adults,

29:18.157 --> 29:21.124
But concentrate that into
a baby food jar...

29:22.161 --> 29:24.127

food?

29:26.865 --> 29:28.999
- The building looks new.

29:29.068 --> 29:31.067

contamination is happening

29:31.103 --> 29:32.870
In the fields.

<i> own produce on your farm?</i>

29:39.845 --> 29:43.146

we're a farm-to-jar operation.

29:43.149 --> 29:44.748

29:44.883 --> 29:46.750
And all of it is plant-based.
- Okay,

29:46.885 --> 29:48.818
What kinds of pesticides
and fertilizers do you use?

29:48.854 --> 29:50.754
- Nothing that canadians
haven't been eating

29:50.889 --> 29:52.488
For decades,
if you're worried about that.

29:52.525 --> 29:54.024
- Well, it can get absorbed
into the soil,

29:54.159 --> 29:55.692
And then end up
in the food chain.

29:55.761 --> 29:57.894
- Pesticides save us 30%
of our crop every year, easy.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.163
- What about heavy metals
we're seeing in fields now?

30:00.199 --> 30:01.865
- Yeah, a lot of that's
naturally occurring.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.767
- Well, it's dangerous
for developing brains.

30:03.902 --> 30:05.969
- Which is why we test all
of our raw ingredients

30:05.971 --> 30:07.937
For pesticide residue,
and heavy metals.

30:07.973 --> 30:09.673

out of the names.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.333

rigorous precautions.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.402

you wanna do it,

surface. Every crop, every jar.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.701
- Pretty good.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.304
Except for a cancer scare
a few months back.

40:08.306 --> 40:09.839
- Cancer?

40:09.841 --> 40:12.841
- Yeah, you know,
radiation, and surgery,

40:12.843 --> 40:14.644
But that was to repair
a hole in my spine

40:14.713 --> 40:17.246
That was exacerbated
by a suspect attack.

40:18.784 --> 40:21.551
- Nothing could ever
beat you, mcavoy.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.720
- You look good too, and...

40:24.790 --> 40:26.756
I can't quite put
my finger on it.

40:28.159 --> 40:29.659
- Yeah.

40:29.728 --> 40:32.728
I've been doing this amazing
life-coach thing now,

40:33.999 --> 40:36.632
Learning to take responsibility
for my actions.

40:38.270 --> 40:40.003
Speaking of which,

40:40.005 --> 40:41.904
There is somebody here
who would like to see you.

40:44.476 --> 40:45.941
(door opens, panting)

40:45.977 --> 40:47.477
- Lexie!

40:47.612 --> 40:49.712
(laughs)

40:49.848 --> 40:52.482
Hi! How are you?
(lexie barks)

40:52.551 --> 40:54.283
(gasps) ohhhh!

40:54.319 --> 40:56.151
So good to see you!

40:56.188 --> 40:57.887
That grey looks good on you!

40:58.022 --> 40:59.788
(laughs)

41:01.459 --> 41:02.591
(lexie pants)
(content exhale)

41:05.330 --> 41:07.796
It's-it's good to see you.

41:10.101 --> 41:12.035
(sighs,
lexie whimpers)

41:12.170 --> 41:13.536
(chuckles)

41:14.906 --> 41:16.539
(car rumbles)

41:17.709 --> 41:19.542
(gravel crunches,
brakes squeak)

41:20.912 --> 41:22.579
(engine cuts out)

41:22.581 --> 41:24.514
(crickets chirp)

41:24.583 --> 41:26.983
(door opens)
jenny: Ah!

41:27.052 --> 41:28.951
(sighs)
(door shuts)

41:29.020 --> 41:30.720
- Where were you?

41:30.855 --> 41:32.388
- Dad and peggy asleep?

41:32.457 --> 41:35.058
- Yeah.
- Oh, what are we doin'?

41:35.193 --> 41:37.560
Are we drowning our sorrows
or are we celebrating?

41:38.830 --> 41:41.797
- I got a terrible review
on a foodscouts order.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.500
Come on.

41:44.769 --> 41:46.603
Come on, say it,
I know you want to.

41:46.605 --> 41:48.871
Say "I told you so."
- no.

41:51.910 --> 41:54.143
I think they're missing out.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.678
(owl hoots in the distance)

41:56.748 --> 41:58.547
- (laughs wryly)

41:58.583 --> 42:00.416
I don't know, I mean,
I can...

42:00.485 --> 42:02.885
I can handle a little
heartbreak,

42:02.954 --> 42:06.255
But uh... Yeah, we're gonna need
some more wine.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.693
- We are in luck.
- No way!

42:10.729 --> 42:12.428
- Because-- yeah.

42:12.497 --> 42:14.564
Guess what I picked up
on the way home.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.499
- Oh! Psychic!
- Tah-dah!

42:16.501 --> 42:18.034
- I'll go get the bottle
opener.

42:18.103 --> 42:20.369
- No, don't, you-you really
cannot find a thing

42:20.405 --> 42:22.105
In that post-it-note house.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.373
- Okay, well, how are we gonna
open the bottle, genius?

42:24.409 --> 42:26.175
- Give it to me and find out.

42:26.177 --> 42:27.676
Come on, I have a method.

42:28.847 --> 42:30.179
- Okay, now, give me your shoe.
- Absolutely not.

42:30.248 --> 42:31.648
Use your own shoe.

42:31.650 --> 42:33.983
- It has to have a heel on it.
I literally can't.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.751
Give me your shoe, come on.

42:38.123 --> 42:40.323
- Oh! All right.
- You've never seen me do this?

42:40.458 --> 42:42.391
- No.
- Kid stuff.

42:42.427 --> 42:43.892
- Can you be careful
with those? Ross!

42:43.929 --> 42:45.328
- Okay. No, there's no need.

42:45.330 --> 42:47.196
It's really easy. And I need
to sort of-- just like that.

42:47.265 --> 42:48.598
- Ross, those are really
expensive!

42:48.667 --> 42:50.600
- It's coming, don't worry!
- Ross, what are you doing?

42:50.735 --> 42:52.468
- We're gonna get it
any minute now. Oh!

42:52.604 --> 42:54.337
- It's ruined!
- Look! We're good.

42:54.406 --> 42:55.572
- Oh my god!

42:55.707 --> 42:57.607
Peggy: What are you doing
out here?! Be quiet!

42:57.676 --> 42:59.942
You're going to wake up gordie.

42:59.945 --> 43:02.612
- (gasps)
- oh, anybody want some vino?

43:02.747 --> 43:04.347
- Daaaad!

43:04.482 --> 43:05.881
- Woo hoo!
(both laugh)

43:05.917 --> 43:08.951
- Now, is that a genius idea?
(all laugh)

43:11.156 --> 43:13.756
- Look, clean off, no bits.
