01:01.644 --> 01:02.771
I'm coming in.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.418
I heard the news.

01:26.628 --> 01:27.837
You must be in shock.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.800
She was one of your best friends
after all.

01:37.472 --> 01:41.392
But you can't control how others feel.

01:45.480 --> 01:49.692
Even if you let it hurt you,
it's just a waste of emotions.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.363
Forget it.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.789
Crying like this won't do you any good.

02:05.542 --> 02:06.668
Cheer up.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.450
Lady Jung.

02:42.912 --> 02:44.581
I can't believe this happened.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.546
But I guess it happens quite often.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.299
I looked it up. There is something called

02:55.091 --> 02:57.844
"Munchausen syndrome by proxy."

02:59.596 --> 03:04.058
A person would hurt someone vulnerable
to get attention.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.477
It's a type of mental illness.

03:09.480 --> 03:13.359
Your friend must have considered herself
to be your caregiver.

03:13.693 --> 03:17.363
But since you got better,
she felt threatened.

03:19.073 --> 03:22.410
So, you need to be
psychologically unstable

03:22.493 --> 03:24.245
for her to have a role,

03:24.746 --> 03:26.789
and that way, she can get the attention

03:27.081 --> 03:29.959
and praise from people
around her and stuff.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.296
If you look at it in a positive light,

03:33.504 --> 03:35.548
it's because you are improving,

03:35.632 --> 03:36.674
-that's why...
-Sorry.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.428
My head hurts.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.306
Okay.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.391
Sorry.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.287
Ye-eun.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.807
Are you okay, Ye-eun?

04:33.856 --> 04:35.024
Oh no.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.527
Ye-eun, you look...

04:40.738 --> 04:42.407
You can't even eat.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.994
What if you get sick?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.664
Don't cry, Ye-eun.

04:54.377 --> 04:56.421
Please, don't cry.

05:04.929 --> 05:07.056
We said to console her,
not make her cry more.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.726
When I saw her face...

06:55.665 --> 06:57.375
What? What do you want me to do?

07:02.213 --> 07:04.465
There are things even I can't do.

07:07.426 --> 07:08.511
Sorry

07:10.138 --> 07:11.514
for killing the mood.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.743
Mommy's here!

07:34.412 --> 07:35.872
-Yi-na.
-Yi-na.

07:55.766 --> 07:58.311
EPISODE 10
MIGHT BE ME #TheSenseofanEnding

07:58.895 --> 08:02.899
What a crazy bitch.
Where is Ye-eun? In her room?

08:03.107 --> 08:04.400
Hey! Ye-eun!

08:04.484 --> 08:06.360
-Yi-na.
-Go easy on her.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.821
She's like a broken glass bottle.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.907
-What will you do?
-Let go.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.409
Oh, no.

08:14.368 --> 08:15.703
Hey, you moron!

08:16.746 --> 08:18.498
Why are you all down?

08:23.920 --> 08:24.754
Hey.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.340
What about that bitch?
What happened to her?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.927
She was too shocked and just left.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.386
You idiot.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.347
You let her off like that?

08:34.639 --> 08:36.224
Where does she live?

08:36.307 --> 08:38.309
I'll yank out all of her hair.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.728
-What are you doing? Get up!
-Hey.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.272
-Yi-na.
-You are too worked up.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.817
Calm down first.
There's a reason, so listen first...

08:46.901 --> 08:49.153
Yes, she had her reasons.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.489
Her dad's store got bankrupt,
and she can't get a job.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.282
She's very stressed, and...

08:53.366 --> 08:55.868
Don't give me that.
So, what if she's stressed?

08:55.952 --> 08:57.453
Crazy bitch. Is she the only one?

08:57.578 --> 08:59.664
Who doesn't have it hard?
Everyone struggles.

08:59.997 --> 09:03.167
She should handle it herself.
Why is she taking it out on Ye-eun?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.293
And you girls,

09:05.253 --> 09:07.463
whose side are you on?
Are you on that bitch's side?

09:07.547 --> 09:08.923
Why are you defending her?

09:09.757 --> 09:11.634
What are you doing, stupid? Get dressed.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.178
What?

09:15.304 --> 09:16.305
Thank you.

09:21.519 --> 09:22.937
Thank you very much,

09:23.646 --> 09:26.816
but I'll do it on my own.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.570
I'll really let that bitch have it.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.530
I can do it.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.491
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

09:37.868 --> 09:41.664
You scream all the time,
but you are so naive.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.334
That's why losers target you.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.588
Come out. Let's eat ice cream.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.479
Let's eat.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.607
You are the best.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.317
This looks really delicious.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.406
So you are the new housemate.

10:16.073 --> 10:16.907
Yes.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.370
You are tall.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.083
It depends on whom you compare me to.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.174
I'll sit here.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.302
-Yi-na, come here.
-Why?

10:36.802 --> 10:37.887
What the...

10:40.181 --> 10:41.849
Is it because I don't live here?
Is that it?

10:41.932 --> 10:44.101
That's not it.
I want you to sit next to me.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.155
Ice cream.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.785
-How long has it been?
-It has been so long.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.335
Why is it wrapped up so tightly?

11:12.046 --> 11:13.130
It smells so good.

11:13.672 --> 11:15.758
What is this nasty letter?

11:17.927 --> 11:19.053
"Su and Su."

11:20.346 --> 11:22.515
-What's Su and Su?
-It's a spa.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.559
-Have you been to that place?
-Yes.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.687
Did you go last winter too?
Around Christmas?

11:29.188 --> 11:32.149
No. I couldn't go anymore
after I moved in October.

11:33.275 --> 11:36.779
I gave you the gift certificates
to use before they expired.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.949
So that's the place...

11:40.533 --> 11:41.784
Where we all went together?

11:42.952 --> 11:45.329
Then all four of you went there?

11:51.961 --> 11:54.505
It was winter, right?

11:54.588 --> 11:56.132
Help the needy.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.969
It was before Christmas.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.637
THE SALVATION ARMY

12:01.720 --> 12:03.097
Help the needy.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.516
Skip that part.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.601
Get to the point.

12:08.227 --> 12:12.773
No. We don't know where the clues are,
so say everything you remember.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.109
Help the needy.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.069
We're collecting for the needy.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.365
It was before I had to work
at the convenience store,

12:21.449 --> 12:22.783
so around 3 p.m.?

12:23.993 --> 12:26.620
That's right. It was very quiet.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.124
There was a painting in the elevator.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.501
It was a famous painting.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.004
-Van Gogh?
-No.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.006
-Manet?
-No.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.924
-Renoir?
-No.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.759
You know.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.761
The one on coffee cups.

12:43.053 --> 12:45.139
A woman lying on a yellow background.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.808
Oh, that? That...

12:48.809 --> 12:49.685
Judith.

12:49.768 --> 12:51.103
Klimt's Judith.

12:53.814 --> 12:56.692
Skip things like that.
I'm sure it was a copy anyway.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.153
I thought we should say
everything we remember.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.197
Anyway, it did seem fancy.

13:03.157 --> 13:06.202
That's right. The hallway was all marble.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.666
Did we see anyone up to that point?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.126
-No.
-No.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.465
Yes.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.843
Yes. We will see you next week. Okay.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.179
Then the first person we saw there...

13:25.763 --> 13:28.432
Hello. Do you have an appointment?

13:28.516 --> 13:30.518
-Yes.
-What is your name?

13:30.809 --> 13:32.311
Me? Ji-won Song.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.980
-That's not it.
-Yi-na Kang.

13:36.065 --> 13:36.941
Yi-na Kang...

13:37.274 --> 13:38.901
Yes, Ms. Yi-na Kang.

13:39.026 --> 13:41.403
It's for four people, correct?
This way, please.

13:45.115 --> 13:48.536
Ms. Yi-na Kang must be very busy lately.

13:48.619 --> 13:49.954
Yes, a bit.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.081
This is your room.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.418
Wait.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.632
Let's take a break.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.634
I need to use the bathroom.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.058
What's with them?

14:15.229 --> 14:18.065
It's all correct up to this point, right?
No errors, right?

14:20.317 --> 14:22.778
Okay, let's continue.

14:24.613 --> 14:26.615
After we entered the room...

14:27.074 --> 14:28.242
What did we do?

14:32.037 --> 14:33.163
What did we do?

14:34.039 --> 14:36.709
After we entered the room...

14:38.586 --> 14:40.629
What else? You probably changed.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.215
That's right. You are a genius.

14:44.842 --> 14:48.512
The changing room is that way.
Please change and wait in here.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.180
-Okay.
-Okay.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.074
I wonder how much this place costs.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.244
Who cares? We won't be coming back.
This is nice.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.414
I always thought
Yi-na has really nice skin.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.917
If you spend this much money,
your skin should be nice.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.878
It's not that nice
considering the money she spent.

15:25.966 --> 15:29.219
I didn't! I didn't say it like that.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.096
Then how did you say it?

15:31.305 --> 15:32.139
Well...

15:33.432 --> 15:34.516
Well...

15:35.726 --> 15:39.605
Yi-na's skin really is nice, but...

15:40.814 --> 15:42.107
So,

15:43.943 --> 15:45.152
the people we saw

15:49.156 --> 15:50.824
until we made our way out...

15:50.950 --> 15:52.284
Have a nice day.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.127
They were all employees.

16:03.754 --> 16:07.758
That place is booked by appointment only,
so you wouldn't run into people there.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.053
That means

16:12.096 --> 16:15.265
the one who wrote the letter
is one of the beauty therapists

16:15.808 --> 16:18.310
who were in the room with us that day.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.438
They're here. Concentrate.

16:21.522 --> 16:22.481
Hello.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.983
Hello.

16:24.066 --> 16:25.192
We will start now.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.861
Try to remember their faces.
Did anyone see them?

16:27.945 --> 16:29.780
How could we remember that?

16:31.448 --> 16:32.908
I don't remember.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.246
I think I tried to look.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.373
Look at me. Aren't I sexy?

16:41.792 --> 16:43.252
You stupid.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.587
We could have seen them.

16:45.838 --> 16:49.091
I was just being my usual self.

16:51.635 --> 16:53.429
We will put the steam towel on now.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.142
That was our last chance.

16:58.934 --> 17:02.354
Our eyes were closed from then on.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.440
Who gets a facial with their eyes open?

17:11.572 --> 17:15.659
Her hands were very small and soft.

17:18.495 --> 17:20.539
We will apply the plaster mask now.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.916
-May we cover your eyes?
-Yes.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.422
We shouldn't have covered our eyes.

17:28.505 --> 17:29.673
I know.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.968
We were with them for an hour,
but we didn't see their faces.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.388
That's not important right now.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.141
You guys could've been killed.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.288
I wish you could sleep over.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.332
Yes, stay for a night next time.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.291
Drive safely.

18:04.792 --> 18:05.793
Hello.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.920
-Hey.
-What are you doing there?

18:08.879 --> 18:10.881
-I was just...
-It's a guy.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.216
Yes, I'm a guy.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.176
He's hers. Don't touch him.

18:15.385 --> 18:17.304
Seriously. He is not mine.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.098
Why won't you say anything?

18:19.181 --> 18:20.265
What?

18:21.225 --> 18:22.726
He's the landlord's agent.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.395
I'll see you again.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.065
Yes, I'll see you again. But when...

18:28.565 --> 18:32.027
I'll be moving back in here,
so I'll see you then.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.195
You will?

18:33.779 --> 18:35.948
Then you have to keep...

18:36.031 --> 18:37.991
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.993
Go.

18:44.248 --> 18:46.458
-Come visit again!
-Keep in touch.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.793
-Bye.
-Make sure to eat.

18:47.876 --> 18:48.794
Give us a call!

18:51.839 --> 18:53.799
-I hope she gets home safely.
-Right?

18:54.091 --> 18:55.175
Let's go in.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.930
Let's go in, Lady Jung.

19:00.013 --> 19:00.931
Night!

19:01.014 --> 19:03.016
-Good night.
-Good night.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.944
Why don't you tell them it isn't true?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.196
Isn't it annoying?

19:16.947 --> 19:19.616
Really? I don't care.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.870
Does it annoy you?

19:36.091 --> 19:37.593
I don't care.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.469
Does it annoy you?

19:50.397 --> 19:51.356
Does it annoy you?

20:01.658 --> 20:03.911
-A spa?
-Yes.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.162
All four of them?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.082
That means all four of them are suspects.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.417
Suspects?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.836
There is a 25% probability.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.588
Is everyone here?

20:16.465 --> 20:17.674
Why is no one answering?

20:18.258 --> 20:19.801
-Yes.
-Open your books.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.012
I'll take the attendance.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.139
-Joon-sung Kang.
-Here.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.642
-Ki-joo Kwon.
-Here.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.977
What happened with Jang-hoon?

20:30.145 --> 20:31.647
-Sung-yul Moon?
-Here.

20:31.730 --> 20:32.940
Young-jin Park?

20:33.857 --> 20:35.234
-In-soo Park?
-Here.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.069
Did you tell them you are dating?

20:37.819 --> 20:40.864
-Yoon-jae Song. Yoo-jin Shin.
-Here.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.950
-Ye-ji Ahn?
-Here.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.826
Jung-soo Ahn?

20:45.869 --> 20:46.954
Ki-young Lee.

IDEA CONTEST

21:05.180 --> 21:06.056
Hi.

21:11.478 --> 21:12.562
She's psychotic.

21:12.646 --> 21:14.731
She said hi while smiling.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.817
As if nothing happened.

21:17.109 --> 21:20.195
She was so nonchalant,
that I almost greeted back.

21:23.573 --> 21:26.868
What is her problem?
How could she smile at me?

21:27.035 --> 21:29.621
She should get on her knees and apologize.

21:32.541 --> 21:36.336
I let it go so things wouldn't blow up.
Now she thinks it's really nothing.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.964
She could go to jail for what she did.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.470
What's wrong?

21:47.139 --> 21:48.140
What?

21:48.473 --> 21:49.725
Are you mad at me?

21:51.852 --> 21:53.937
Did I say something wrong?

21:54.688 --> 21:57.399
-Enjoy your lunch.
-You too.

21:57.482 --> 22:01.653
Are you cutting Yoo-kyung out?
I don't see you with her anymore.

22:08.785 --> 22:10.245
I need to go.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.471
Ye-eun, you're home.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.473
Hi. Are you going somewhere?

22:29.556 --> 22:32.142
Yes. I'm meeting a friend nearby.

22:32.225 --> 22:34.061
-Have fun.
-Thanks.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.492
Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22, 2nd Floor

23:05.884 --> 23:07.052
Hey.

23:09.846 --> 23:11.723
Were you surprised that I called?

23:11.932 --> 23:13.100
A little.

23:13.683 --> 23:15.477
I just wanted to have a drink with you.

23:34.621 --> 23:36.998
I guess we've never had
a drink alone before.

23:37.582 --> 23:38.416
Right.

23:39.167 --> 23:41.586
Also, you never go drinking
with just one other person.

23:42.546 --> 23:45.632
No. It's a little hard for me
to get to know people.

23:45.841 --> 23:46.675
A little?

23:48.343 --> 23:49.511
A lot.

23:51.638 --> 23:55.308
When I first met you,
I thought you were handicapped.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.938
You don't look people in the eye
when you talk,

24:00.313 --> 24:03.108
and you mumble and speak so quietly
that people can't hear.

24:04.818 --> 24:07.988
I was shocked
that you were dating Jong-yeoul.

24:10.866 --> 24:15.162
A lot of girls my year
had a thing for Jong-yeoul.

24:15.829 --> 24:17.372
What? Really?

24:18.832 --> 24:20.292
You missed the orientation, right?

24:21.710 --> 24:23.962
Yes. I had a cold then.

24:25.338 --> 24:29.426
A junior guy got drunk
during the orientation and caused a scene.

24:30.093 --> 24:33.555
He made all these weird jokes
to the freshman girls.

24:34.556 --> 24:38.018
It was a kind of awkward to get mad,
but it was a bit offensive.

24:38.602 --> 24:40.270
Anyway, that is how it was.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.190
Then suddenly, Jong-yeoul walked over,

24:43.273 --> 24:45.192
sat next to him,

24:45.734 --> 24:47.360
and told him to drink with him,

24:47.861 --> 24:50.655
and told the girls to go elsewhere.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.242
A lot of the girls fell for him
at that moment.

24:55.952 --> 24:57.579
I was one of them.

24:59.372 --> 25:00.498
What?

25:01.958 --> 25:05.086
Well, it's not like he did anything great,

25:05.503 --> 25:09.716
but I felt like he was kind of cool.

25:11.259 --> 25:14.971
That's why I had been waiting
for the right time to tell him.

25:18.516 --> 25:20.185
I had no idea.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.230
Well, you know,
I have a pretty good poker face.

25:25.774 --> 25:26.608
I guess.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.536
Are you really not going to ask

25:39.496 --> 25:42.207
why I'm telling you this now?

25:47.045 --> 25:48.255
I'll be honest.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.926
When you said you and Jong-yeoul broke up,

25:53.718 --> 25:56.972
a part of me felt like it was my chance.

25:57.555 --> 26:01.559
But I didn't want to try right away
as if I was waiting,

26:02.394 --> 26:03.979
so I hesitated.

26:04.729 --> 26:07.899
But after seeing how you have
a new boyfriend,

26:08.775 --> 26:13.029
I thought it would be okay for me
to tell him how I feel.

26:16.741 --> 26:19.452
I know it's a bit odd

26:20.078 --> 26:21.496
saying this to you,

26:22.831 --> 26:26.626
but I felt like I would be betraying you
if I didn't tell you first.

26:28.295 --> 26:31.131
I hate people talking about me
behind my back.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.051
Are you upset?

26:37.887 --> 26:39.639
No. I...

26:41.391 --> 26:44.185
It's not like he belongs to me.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.231
That's true.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.209
Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22, 2nd Floor

27:28.938 --> 27:30.023
You are eating again?

27:30.398 --> 27:31.858
Yes, why?

27:33.401 --> 27:36.780
You are very skinny
considering how much you eat.

27:37.864 --> 27:40.158
When I eat a lot,
I throw it all up at home.

27:40.992 --> 27:44.412
-Hey.
-Don't say anything. No lecturing.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.252
Eun.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.426
What are you doing here?

27:59.636 --> 28:00.845
Ask her.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.265
It's because you are being stupid.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.769
You should give me a straight answer.

28:09.479 --> 28:11.356
You like Eun, right?

28:11.981 --> 28:14.234
-What are you doing?
-You be quiet.

28:14.317 --> 28:15.235
Answer me.

28:18.321 --> 28:19.322
Yes.

28:20.115 --> 28:21.533
Then why is it a secret?

28:22.700 --> 28:24.244
That's what she wants.

28:24.327 --> 28:27.372
It would be uncomfortable,
since he lives in the same house.

28:28.915 --> 28:30.959
Fine. I'll give you that.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.379
Did you tell your friends about Eun?

28:35.922 --> 28:38.925
I looked into it,
and they say if a guy likes a girl,

28:39.134 --> 28:42.011
he tells his friends
and introduces her to them.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.765
-Have you met his friends?
-What?

28:46.433 --> 28:48.768
You haven't, right? What's wrong with you?

28:50.478 --> 28:52.897
That's because my friends aren't in Seoul.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.649
You are going to the army soon.

28:56.234 --> 28:57.527
Wait a second.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.947
Are you dating just any random girl

29:01.030 --> 29:03.116
because you are dejected
about going to the army?

29:03.324 --> 29:05.326
-Hey.
-Be quiet.

29:05.952 --> 29:09.080
He's about to go to the army.
You should think about it.

29:09.164 --> 29:12.208
What if you waste two years of your life,

29:12.709 --> 29:15.211
and he says he doesn't actually like you
when he gets out?

29:15.462 --> 29:16.963
You will be an idiot.

29:18.715 --> 29:20.675
You should treat her well.

29:23.720 --> 29:24.929
Do you understand?

29:26.431 --> 29:27.265
I got it.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.566
Where will be the party be held?

29:36.649 --> 29:39.152
I think it will be at the same place
as our previous party.

29:40.361 --> 29:41.738
Don't make Yoo-rim drink this time.

29:41.821 --> 29:44.032
-You made her drink.
-I did not.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.658
-Seriously.
-You did too.

29:45.742 --> 29:48.286
-That wasn't me.
-Eun-jae.

29:48.369 --> 29:49.370
Then who?

29:49.454 --> 29:51.456
-You made her drink.
-Me?

29:51.539 --> 29:52.707
I have pictures.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.251
-Really? My bad.
-Seriously.

29:55.835 --> 29:59.798
-No.
-I don't think that is right.

30:00.924 --> 30:03.676
-How can I trust you?
-What do you mean?

30:03.760 --> 30:04.761
I can't stand her.

30:05.345 --> 30:08.014
She was all giggly and stuff.
I wanted to barf.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.182
She looked so awkward.

30:09.265 --> 30:13.019
And why did she tell me she wants
to tell him how she feels?

30:13.102 --> 30:16.356
What if I said no? She'll do
what she wants anyway. What a fake.

30:16.439 --> 30:19.150
I couldn't stand her from the start.
That show-off.

30:19.734 --> 30:22.237
You liked her.
You said she was smart and cool.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.363
I did not.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.990
So? Did she tell him?

30:26.074 --> 30:27.867
I don't know. Who cares?

30:27.951 --> 30:29.035
It won't work out anyway.

30:29.118 --> 30:30.995
Why not? Is she not pretty?

30:31.079 --> 30:32.163
She's not pretty.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.332
She has short hair and dresses like a guy.

30:34.415 --> 30:36.501
She isn't the type
that guys like. Not at all.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.718
I'm not saying everyone with short hair
is like that.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.555
I meant...

30:50.306 --> 30:51.641
-That's mine.
-That's mine.

30:53.726 --> 30:56.354
-It's mine.
-It's mine.

30:57.605 --> 30:58.773
Sorry.

30:59.065 --> 31:01.860
-Thanks!
-Apologizing makes it weirder.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.987
Come in and hang out.

31:04.070 --> 31:04.988
It's okay.

31:05.071 --> 31:06.197
-Come in.
-Come in.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.574
It's really okay.

31:08.908 --> 31:10.618
Hello.

31:10.702 --> 31:11.703
Hello.

31:16.416 --> 31:19.961
Why are you acting all distant?

31:20.712 --> 31:23.715
Are you embarrassed because of
the old ladies? Should we leave?

31:25.300 --> 31:27.343
We can't do that. A guy and

31:27.427 --> 31:28.970
-a girl can't...
-We're not dating.

31:32.265 --> 31:34.726
Right? You don't like me, right?

31:38.146 --> 31:39.022
Yes.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.984
Then why did you say you were dating?

31:44.319 --> 31:46.029
We had to say that at the time.

31:46.946 --> 31:47.947
I'll leave now.

31:51.618 --> 31:52.702
Really?

31:53.912 --> 31:56.080
I told you already that we aren't dating.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.043
I don't like short cheesy guys either.

32:20.688 --> 32:21.898
The attached file?

32:22.815 --> 32:24.901
I'm sure I sent it.

32:27.028 --> 32:31.115
Okay. I understand.
I'll check and call you back.

32:31.616 --> 32:32.617
Okay.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.577
-Mr. Son.
-Yes?

32:34.702 --> 32:37.622
Do you want to take time off? Forever?

32:38.206 --> 32:39.374
Let's do it right.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.711
Check who'll be on duty during holidays.

33:10.863 --> 33:14.117
Have you heard from Heimdallr?

33:18.496 --> 33:21.124
His family called,
saying they can't reach him.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.334
They didn't seem to know anything.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.964
He's such an idiot, so...

33:30.383 --> 33:31.718
He's such a pain.

33:59.996 --> 34:03.750
If you really had talent,
you would have survived somehow.

34:04.542 --> 34:05.877
You are not talented.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.879
You may not want to admit it,

34:08.671 --> 34:10.757
but you are a leftover among leftovers.

34:11.090 --> 34:12.216
Do you even know...

34:12.300 --> 34:14.844
I do have talent! What do you know?

34:27.815 --> 34:31.277
-Excuse me.
-I'm sorry, but we're closed.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.405
I'm looking for someone.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.033
I came here last December.

34:37.116 --> 34:39.827
I'm looking for the person
who gave me my facial.

34:40.036 --> 34:43.331
I see. May I ask what it's about?

34:44.499 --> 34:47.085
I think I need to apologize for something.

34:48.127 --> 34:49.837
Do you know her name?

34:50.171 --> 34:51.631
I don't.

34:52.548 --> 34:56.844
The four of us came here at around 3 p.m.
on December 13th.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.138
Do you have a record?

34:59.222 --> 35:02.517
No. We keep our records
for only three months.

35:07.396 --> 35:09.190
-Goodbye.
-Have a nice day.

35:09.273 --> 35:10.733
-Have a nice day.
-Have a nice day.

35:11.025 --> 35:13.528
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day.

35:13.611 --> 35:14.612
Thanks.

35:18.074 --> 35:19.117
Thank you.

35:25.832 --> 35:27.834
Hey, Jin-myung.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.794
-Hi.
-Welcome home.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.264
Mapo-gu Yeonnam-ro 22, 2nd Floor

35:43.141 --> 35:45.977
I went there. Su and Su.

35:48.437 --> 35:51.816
-To find the person who wrote the letter.
-What? Alone?

35:52.275 --> 35:54.193
We agreed to go altogether.

35:54.402 --> 35:57.697
Sorry. I suddenly felt like
I could be the one

35:58.364 --> 35:59.574
the letter was meant for.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.910
So? What did you find out?

36:03.369 --> 36:05.413
Places like that
have a high turnover rate.

36:06.247 --> 36:07.456
I didn't find out much.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.459
You have no sense of strategy.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.380
Actually,

36:16.048 --> 36:17.300
I went too.

36:20.511 --> 36:24.515
Well, I thought maybe
it had to do with Yoo-kyung.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.060
Hello.

36:30.605 --> 36:31.606
This is from here, right?

36:32.190 --> 36:33.232
Yes, it is.

36:34.817 --> 36:36.777
You see this? This is my address.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.906
Why is that...

36:39.989 --> 36:40.990
Exactly.

36:45.953 --> 36:46.913
You know her, right?

36:48.789 --> 36:50.416
I have never seen her before.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.043
Really?

36:52.126 --> 36:53.336
So?

36:54.420 --> 36:58.799
She said they would be more careful
not to disclose clients' information.

37:00.635 --> 37:01.594
So,

37:02.178 --> 37:05.097
all that was disclosed was that letter,
is that it?

37:06.432 --> 37:07.433
Still,

37:07.683 --> 37:10.561
I found out that Yoo-kyung
had nothing to do with it.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.982
Did you go too?

37:16.025 --> 37:16.943
No.

37:21.113 --> 37:22.990
I didn't go inside.

37:25.743 --> 37:27.203
I did go, but...

37:28.246 --> 37:30.164
-When I got there,
-Thank you.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.583
I didn't know what to say.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.001
Have a nice day.

37:37.755 --> 37:39.757
So technically, I didn't go.

37:43.636 --> 37:44.929
What?

37:45.554 --> 37:47.473
We have to make a new plan.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.809
I had an incredible idea.

38:03.864 --> 38:04.949
Let's go.

38:09.620 --> 38:10.454
It's me.

38:11.539 --> 38:13.874
You don't recognize me
just because I'm wearing make-up?

38:21.382 --> 38:22.425
Where are we going?

38:22.967 --> 38:25.553
-A plastic surgeon? A spa?
-Yes.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.223
What am I supposed to do at a spa?

38:29.682 --> 38:31.517
You just stay still.

38:32.268 --> 38:35.563
That's why it had to be me?
To just stay still?

38:35.688 --> 38:37.857
Yes. It's something only you can do.

38:39.191 --> 38:40.276
Really?

38:40.776 --> 38:42.737
Then I'll stay still as best as I can.

38:52.705 --> 38:55.249
Hello. Do you have an appointment?

38:55.916 --> 38:58.044
Yes, under the name Sung-min Lim.

38:58.586 --> 39:01.589
I see. But it's for only one person.

39:02.423 --> 39:05.593
That's right. I'm fine. It's for him.

39:06.635 --> 39:09.680
Babe, it must be
because you have been tired lately,

39:09.764 --> 39:11.307
but your skin is a mess.

39:11.891 --> 39:15.019
I asked for the best beauty therapist
who has been here the longest.

39:15.102 --> 39:18.147
Yes. Everyone here is great,

39:18.230 --> 39:20.399
but we scheduled you
for the most experienced person.

39:20.483 --> 39:21.359
Please come this way.

39:29.867 --> 39:30.826
This way.

39:37.166 --> 39:39.335
She will come in once you have changed.

39:47.134 --> 39:48.677
Are you going to wait in here?

39:50.679 --> 39:53.057
Yes. Can't I wait here?

39:54.350 --> 39:55.184
You can.

40:00.523 --> 40:01.357
Change.

40:11.700 --> 40:12.576
Wait outside.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.746
Why are you being so shy
in front of a friend?

40:16.330 --> 40:17.289
Should I leave instead?

40:17.957 --> 40:19.542
I'm going then.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.469
You are unbelievably quick.

40:40.563 --> 40:41.856
Where did you get that outfit?

40:42.857 --> 40:43.899
Why?

40:44.733 --> 40:47.403
You bastard.
It seems like you were surprised.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.449
I look sexy, right? Incredible, right?

40:52.867 --> 40:54.201
Amazing, right?

40:59.832 --> 41:01.709
Oh, my. Thank you.

41:04.795 --> 41:06.922
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

41:08.757 --> 41:09.758
Hello.

41:10.509 --> 41:11.802
I'll begin now.

41:13.053 --> 41:14.221
Sir?

41:23.272 --> 41:24.982
I'll put the steam towel on now.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.075
AH-RA

41:47.546 --> 41:49.465
I'll begin your facial now.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.304
-Ms. Ah-ra?
-Pardon?

41:55.846 --> 41:57.056
Yes.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.143
-Is that your real name?
-No.

42:01.727 --> 42:03.354
Everyone uses fake names here.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.777
You are very good.
How long have you been doing this?

42:10.653 --> 42:12.404
It has been 12 years now.

42:14.240 --> 42:17.201
-How long have you been with Su and Su?
-Five years.

42:18.702 --> 42:21.580
You make a really good couple.

42:21.872 --> 42:23.165
How did you meet?

42:24.416 --> 42:27.586
He said he would die without me,
so I had no choice.

42:29.129 --> 42:31.632
Yes, I'm right here.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.008
Don't worry.

42:33.717 --> 42:35.177
See? He's always like this.

42:42.851 --> 42:45.646
-Among the beauty therapists here...
-Yes?

42:45.896 --> 42:47.690
There was someone who read a lot, right?

42:48.357 --> 42:49.233
Read?

42:49.984 --> 42:52.736
She was always reading when I saw her.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.446
She would underline some parts
as she read.

42:57.533 --> 42:58.409
Joann.

42:59.243 --> 43:02.580
Was it Joann? I can't remember.

43:03.038 --> 43:05.040
She was here last December too.

43:05.624 --> 43:06.875
That's probably her.

43:07.501 --> 43:10.212
Joann was the only one who liked to read.

43:12.256 --> 43:13.757
Joann's doing well, right?

43:14.425 --> 43:16.302
I assume so.

43:17.052 --> 43:17.970
She quit.

43:19.388 --> 43:20.472
When?

43:20.889 --> 43:22.224
I think it was last February.

43:23.100 --> 43:27.062
She left without saying she quit,
so they were very angry.

43:27.980 --> 43:31.859
Some people do that at times.
Switching spas without giving notice.

43:34.528 --> 43:36.822
Can I get her contact information?

43:37.573 --> 43:39.366
Contact information?

43:43.662 --> 43:44.997
Oh, no. Did that hurt, babe?

43:45.080 --> 43:47.291
-Oh, no.
-Please be careful.

43:47.374 --> 43:48.667
I'm sorry.

43:56.508 --> 43:59.219
-This is just between us.
-Yes?

44:00.095 --> 44:03.932
The truth is, I'm opening a spa
in Cheongdam.

44:04.600 --> 44:08.729
That's why I'm scouting people
who are highly qualified.

44:09.188 --> 44:14.151
I'd like to recruit Joann
and you, Ms. Ah-ra.

44:17.404 --> 44:18.447
I see.

44:18.697 --> 44:21.283
Of course, we'd match the highest salary.

44:34.046 --> 44:35.047
What are you doing?

44:35.839 --> 44:37.549
The phone rang, but I missed it.

44:40.469 --> 44:41.804
Is room three done?

44:41.970 --> 44:44.306
Yes. I'm going to finish up now.

44:48.227 --> 44:49.770
Joann: Changcheon-dong 782, Seoul

44:56.443 --> 44:58.862
-Would you like me to put sunblock?
-No, thank you.

44:58.987 --> 45:00.948
Okay. I'll finish up.

45:09.498 --> 45:11.500
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

45:13.794 --> 45:14.795
Have a nice day.

45:15.754 --> 45:16.797
You too.

45:23.387 --> 45:25.722
-She must have given you a tip.
-No.

45:31.145 --> 45:33.439
The person is unavailable.

45:34.731 --> 45:36.775
Some people don't answer calls
from unknown numbers...

45:42.406 --> 45:44.241
AUTO EMERGENCY BRAKING

45:54.918 --> 45:56.086
What happened?

45:56.587 --> 45:58.046
Did it stop itself?

45:58.839 --> 46:00.507
This car is nice.

46:00.883 --> 46:02.384
Do something about your skirt.

46:04.678 --> 46:08.098
You can't concentrate. Is that it?

46:08.182 --> 46:09.433
What about this?

46:11.393 --> 46:12.394
Hey.

46:30.829 --> 46:31.788
Hey.

46:39.004 --> 46:41.173
I told you already that we aren't dating.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.759
I don't like short cheesy guys either.

46:48.972 --> 46:50.265
Do you have something to say?

46:54.478 --> 46:55.521
No.

47:29.763 --> 47:33.058
YE-JI AHN

47:41.567 --> 47:43.986
Is everyone home? Is Jin-myung home?

47:44.194 --> 47:45.195
Jin-myung!

47:45.279 --> 47:47.739
-Did you have an interview?
-Never mind. Gather round.

47:47.823 --> 47:49.032
Jin-myung! Hurry!

47:49.324 --> 47:51.577
-What?
-Gather round.

47:54.955 --> 47:57.708
First, let's start with compliments.

47:58.667 --> 48:03.672
Ji-won, you are so smart.
You did great, Ji-won.

48:03.755 --> 48:05.882
-You did great.
-You did great.

48:06.425 --> 48:07.467
What is it?

48:09.219 --> 48:12.598
I found the sender of that pink letter.

48:12.681 --> 48:15.142
-Really? How?
-Who was it?

48:15.225 --> 48:16.184
A beauty therapist?

48:18.729 --> 48:21.356
-Name, Joann.
-A foreigner?

48:21.815 --> 48:24.443
-No.
-Jo as first name and Ann as last name?

48:27.446 --> 48:31.241
It's a fake name.
They use fake names at that spa.

48:31.325 --> 48:33.744
Soo-ji, Ah-ra, Joann. Like that.

48:34.870 --> 48:37.998
This is Joann's cell phone number
and address.

48:38.290 --> 48:40.626
-Did you call her?
-Yes, but she won't pick up.

48:41.585 --> 48:43.879
-Changcheon-dong is...
-Is it close?

48:44.588 --> 48:45.797
Not exactly.

48:45.881 --> 48:47.174
What should we do?

48:47.591 --> 48:48.884
Let's call her first.

48:49.926 --> 48:50.886
Right?

48:51.970 --> 48:54.306
-It's too late anyway.
-I know.

49:02.230 --> 49:03.273
Where are you going?

49:04.524 --> 49:06.443
I'm going there, you know, for a walk.

49:13.200 --> 49:15.118
Where are you all going at this hour?

49:15.702 --> 49:18.705
I know. It's kind of late
to go to someone's house.

49:20.165 --> 49:22.042
It's supposed to rain tonight.

49:22.417 --> 49:24.294
I already washed my face.

49:24.836 --> 49:26.171
Who said you should come?

49:26.421 --> 49:28.507
You guys never give me time
to make a plan.

49:29.049 --> 49:30.717
How far is it?

49:31.385 --> 49:32.594
It's not too far.

49:33.011 --> 49:34.471
Should we call first?

49:35.347 --> 49:37.641
I said we should just go tomorrow.

49:39.393 --> 49:40.936
Slow down.

49:41.228 --> 49:43.021
What are we doing this late at night?

49:45.649 --> 49:46.858
Is it that way?

49:47.275 --> 49:48.652
It says we should go this way.

49:59.871 --> 50:01.456
It's nice out.

50:02.374 --> 50:04.876
How long has it been
since we all came out like this?

50:04.960 --> 50:06.878
-It has been a while.
-Right?

50:06.962 --> 50:09.548
Is it okay to block the street like this?

50:11.299 --> 50:12.509
There's no one here.

50:14.136 --> 50:15.262
How much farther?

50:16.555 --> 50:18.432
-Ten minutes.
-Ten minutes?

50:18.765 --> 50:20.058
That's not bad.

50:34.531 --> 50:35.699
Changcheon-dong 782

50:36.992 --> 50:38.535
POST BOX

50:38.618 --> 50:40.287
This looks like it.

50:41.830 --> 50:42.831
What now?

50:47.669 --> 50:49.755
-What?
-What will you do?

50:50.589 --> 50:53.341
-What?
-You said to come here.

50:53.925 --> 50:56.803
I didn't ask you to come. You followed me.

50:57.929 --> 51:00.140
You must have had a plan though.

51:03.810 --> 51:05.187
I'm sure she did.

51:05.687 --> 51:07.939
No way. I'm sure she did.

51:08.023 --> 51:11.943
She had to have a plan
even if she said she was just going.

51:14.488 --> 51:16.364
Did you really just come?

51:17.824 --> 51:18.658
Yes.

51:20.285 --> 51:22.245
Then will you just go?

51:23.538 --> 51:24.706
Yes.

51:27.209 --> 51:28.251
You idiot.

51:28.543 --> 51:30.212
You tall idiot.

51:31.463 --> 51:34.341
Let's come back another time
after calling.

51:45.852 --> 51:47.771
How hard is it to take out the trash?

51:55.195 --> 51:57.739
-Do you live in unit 102?
-I do.

51:58.698 --> 51:59.783
Joann.

52:05.205 --> 52:06.373
Joann?

52:08.083 --> 52:08.959
Me?

52:10.836 --> 52:11.920
No.

52:13.296 --> 52:14.548
Su and Su.

52:17.926 --> 52:20.178
Su and Su. Facial.

52:21.221 --> 52:22.597
Never mind.

52:24.140 --> 52:25.809
How long have you lived here?

52:27.727 --> 52:30.689
About two years? Why?

52:30.981 --> 52:32.065
Do you live alone?

52:33.441 --> 52:34.860
Why do you ask?

52:35.402 --> 52:38.154
Well, so... We are...

52:38.822 --> 52:41.032
We're looking for Joann.

52:41.616 --> 52:44.953
Her address is here, unit 102.

52:45.453 --> 52:46.997
Why are you looking for her?

52:48.123 --> 52:51.835
We need to talk to her in person.

53:00.552 --> 53:02.387
-Give me your number.
-Sorry?

53:03.221 --> 53:05.557
I'll ask my housemate and give you a call.

53:16.735 --> 53:18.737
Please call me at this number.

53:36.838 --> 53:39.215
-Let's go.
-Good job.

53:47.724 --> 53:49.726
She doesn't know her housemate's name?

53:49.935 --> 53:51.353
Maybe they don't talk.

53:51.811 --> 53:54.272
Still. They should know
each other's names.

53:55.231 --> 53:56.483
Do you want ice cream?

53:58.568 --> 54:00.028
You're buying?

54:01.237 --> 54:02.113
Why not?

54:03.657 --> 54:05.951
-Jin-myung!
-Jin-myung!

54:07.035 --> 54:08.995
It tastes so good
since Jin-myung bought it for us.

54:09.412 --> 54:11.706
You made it sound like
this has never happened.

54:12.082 --> 54:14.125
-Treat us again.
-Okay.

54:14.209 --> 54:15.085
It's so sweet.

54:15.251 --> 54:18.421
-When do you get paid?
-They say a monthly pay never lasts long.

54:18.505 --> 54:20.423
-Right?
-On the 23rd?

54:20.674 --> 54:21.883
The 23rd?

55:32.078 --> 55:33.079
Hey.

55:34.330 --> 55:37.208
Was the woman you used to live with

55:37.709 --> 55:39.878
-a foreigner?
-What?

55:40.378 --> 55:44.340
Someone came by looking for a person.

55:45.633 --> 55:48.428
It was an English name. What was it again?

55:49.721 --> 55:52.348
Mary? Julie?

55:53.516 --> 55:54.517
Joann?

55:58.563 --> 56:01.149
-What did you say?
-Turn off the light.

56:14.788 --> 56:16.289
Wet paint

56:32.388 --> 56:35.433
Look at this. I bought it.
Isn't it pretty?

56:38.311 --> 56:39.938
What's wrong?

56:42.732 --> 56:43.691
What is it?

56:44.818 --> 56:46.736
Did Jang-hoon say something? Tell me.

56:47.278 --> 56:49.614
-Forget it.
-What did that jerk say?

56:50.281 --> 56:53.451
Did he complain about my nagging him
that day? He did, didn't he?

56:53.618 --> 56:55.078
We broke up as you wanted.

56:57.413 --> 56:58.456
Are you happy now?

57:05.213 --> 57:07.006
Hating someone,

57:09.592 --> 57:12.303
being hated by someone...

57:21.563 --> 57:25.066
When I first saw that letter,
it sent chills down my spine.

57:26.943 --> 57:29.279
I was overwhelmed by the intense hatred.

57:34.576 --> 57:35.785
And I thought...

57:36.327 --> 57:39.497
-Again?
-I'm going to return it.

57:42.542 --> 57:46.045
I could never hate anyone
to that extent...

57:48.256 --> 57:50.800
-It's a nice day today.
-It really is.

57:51.426 --> 57:52.594
What about lunch?

57:53.928 --> 57:55.763
They are serving oden at the cafeteria.

57:56.598 --> 57:57.765
What about the sandwich?

57:57.849 --> 58:01.769
I thought I would never be hated by anyone
to that extent.

58:03.188 --> 58:04.772
In the past. And in the future.

58:04.856 --> 58:06.483
-Hello.
-Hello.

58:06.566 --> 58:08.151
-Hello.
-Hello.

58:08.234 --> 58:10.153
-Two, three.
-MAS!

58:10.236 --> 58:11.779
-Hello, we're MAS!
-Hello, we're MAS!

58:13.072 --> 58:15.909
-It's nice to meet you.
-Hello.

58:15.992 --> 58:18.119
Hatred may be like a snowball.

58:19.704 --> 58:21.581
It may start from the size of a fist,

58:21.956 --> 58:25.210
then grow bigger and bigger
as it rolls on top of other emotions.

58:27.837 --> 58:29.923
You hate them
because you like them too much,

58:30.298 --> 58:32.175
because they don't like you enough,

58:33.343 --> 58:35.220
because they have too much,

58:36.137 --> 58:37.764
because you feel too bad,

58:38.932 --> 58:40.683
and because it's out of your control.

58:55.823 --> 58:56.699
Hello?

58:59.160 --> 59:03.206
That hatred, having grown so big,
eventually leaves your hand.

59:07.418 --> 59:08.753
Maybe

59:10.004 --> 59:13.925
that pink letter was for me.

59:15.468 --> 59:18.805
Even if it isn't right at this moment,
maybe tomorrow or the day after.

59:20.014 --> 59:22.392
Perhaps a letter
I was bound to receive one day

59:23.184 --> 59:24.352
arrived

59:25.436 --> 59:27.480
a little too soon.

1:00:15.528 --> 1:00:17.155
Something happened, didn't it?

1:00:17.238 --> 1:00:18.906
Why were you looking for her?

1:00:18.990 --> 1:00:20.825
I should be with you.

1:00:20.908 --> 1:00:25.580
It's because of the letter.
I happened to find a letter.

1:00:25.663 --> 1:00:27.790
Yes, you're the one who ruined my life.

1:00:28.082 --> 1:00:28.916
You.

1:00:29.459 --> 1:00:31.002
When was your life ruined?

1:00:31.586 --> 1:00:33.963
You were laughing, all happy.

1:00:34.547 --> 1:00:38.551
I'm sure you will go on being happy,
without knowing you ruined my life.

1:00:39.677 --> 1:00:41.262
Do something for me.

1:00:41.846 --> 1:00:42.764
Was it you?

1:00:44.515 --> 1:00:46.059
Kill someone for me.

1:00:46.601 --> 1:00:47.560
I'll kill you.

1:00:47.644 --> 1:00:48.770
Ye-eun!

1:00:50.229 --> 1:00:52.607
