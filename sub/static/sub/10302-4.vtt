02:07.800 --> 02:09.995
- Hi, Al. How was work?
- Horrible, Peg.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.198
- I fell off a ladder and I hurt my...
- Well, that's nice.

02:14.240 --> 02:15.832
Because I want you in a good mood.

02:16.040 --> 02:19.430
Honey, I bought a new dress.
How do you like it?

02:22.120 --> 02:25.157
Well, I don't know, Peg.
I'd have to see it without you in it.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.353
What do you need a new dress for?

02:28.600 --> 02:31.512
There's nobody inside the TV
looking at you.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.877
Well, I bought it so I'd be ready.

02:35.120 --> 02:38.829
See? My horoscope says:
"Buy a new dress.

02:39.080 --> 02:43.119
You're about to embark on a new and
unique undertaking." Isn't that great?

02:43.560 --> 02:46.791
Well, the undertaking
has a kind of a nice ring to it.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.070
But Peg, I don't believe
in horoscopes.

02:50.920 --> 02:55.232
And yet you believe in a 19-year-old
in Playboy pouring honey on her tush...

02:55.480 --> 02:57.755
...is really interested
in saving the environment.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.479
I never said I believed her...

02:59.720 --> 03:02.792
...just that I supported her
and loved her very much.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.198
Let's just do your horoscope, Magoo.

03:08.440 --> 03:10.351
Now when's your birthday?

03:14.320 --> 03:15.833
It's two months after yours.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.753
The only difference
is that I have mine every year.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.150
Look, Al, you're a Cancer.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.191
Right back at you.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.594
Honey, you have
an amazing horoscope.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.678
It says... Now brace yourself.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.155
"Good luck's a-coming."

03:37.600 --> 03:40.353
Oh, well, that's a-different.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.910
I always thought horoscopes
were a lot of hooey...

03:44.120 --> 03:46.714
...but after hearing
"good luck's a-coming"...

03:46.960 --> 03:50.316
...I realize they're based
on hard scientific data.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.391
Tell me, does it say
anything in there...

03:52.600 --> 03:55.512
...about "The wife is a-leaving"?

04:01.160 --> 04:04.277
"And the kids are a-with her"?

04:07.600 --> 04:09.238
Hey, Daddy.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.236
Daddy, I'm afraid I have
bad news for you.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.031
Well, pumpkin, that can't be.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.039
The horror with the scope here says,
"Good luck's a-coming."

04:28.320 --> 04:30.880
The health inspector's closing
the diner for two days.

04:31.400 --> 04:35.029
- Well, that's no so bad.
- Well, then they're tearing it down.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.518
Can you believe it? I'm unemployed.

04:37.760 --> 04:40.957
And it's all because
of those stupid raisin cookies.

04:41.440 --> 04:45.115
What, the raisin cookies
you were getting me free every day?

04:45.760 --> 04:51.153
Yeah. You know, it turns out that only
half the raisins were actually raisins.

04:58.920 --> 05:01.309
Well, what was the other half?

05:02.080 --> 05:05.516
Oh, believe me, Daddy,
you do not wanna know.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.269
Oh, well, I guess I'm out of a J-O-D.

05:11.480 --> 05:16.110
All right. Well, now I guess you won't
have enough money to move O-U-L.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.153
Well, not necessarily.

05:19.400 --> 05:23.996
One of the guys from the extermination
company that deloused me...

05:24.200 --> 05:27.875
...remembered me as the Verminator
and want me to be their local mascot.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.877
Here's the part
that's important to you.

05:30.080 --> 05:33.356
You're going to tell me what the
other half of those raisins were?

05:34.520 --> 05:37.273
I can't, Daddy. The guys from
the Atomic Energy Commission...

05:37.480 --> 05:40.153
...said mum's the word on this one.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.070
Anyway...

05:43.280 --> 05:46.158
...the good news is,
I'll be making more than at the diner...

05:46.360 --> 05:48.590
...and I'll be able to move
sooner than I thought.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.309
Well, I'd better get busy.

05:50.520 --> 05:53.512
I'm under court order
to burn this uniform.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.197
- Remember to take it off first, honey.
- Oh, thanks, Mom.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.351
All right, now won't you admit
that your horoscope is right?

06:04.560 --> 06:07.791
- Good luck is a-coming.
- Come on, Peg.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.070
Even if Kelly does leave,
Bud'll still be here.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.511
Having only one kid is like having
only one noose around your neck.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.439
Family, good news.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.073
I pledged a fraternity today...

06:30.280 --> 06:32.635
...and if I'm accepted
I'm moving to the frat house.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.513
Al, did you hear that?

06:35.760 --> 06:39.912
I can't believe it.
I'm finally gonna be a cool frat dude.

06:40.520 --> 06:43.239
I'll have respect. I'll have honour.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.431
I'll be my own man.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.560
Dad, can I have some money?

06:52.040 --> 06:54.793
I gotta go buy a tutu
with a trap door in it.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.789
They're gonna spank me on the corner
of 5th and Main for my initiation.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.638
Make me proud, son.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.916
Bula bula, big guy.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.078
- Do you realize what this means?
- Yes, Peg, I do.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.757
After Bud's arrested, all four of us will
have a record for indecent exposure.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.996
Honey, why is it so hard
for you to admit...

07:17.240 --> 07:18.992
...that you're having good luck?

07:19.920 --> 07:22.115
Peg, have you ever heard
of the Bundy curse?

07:23.160 --> 07:25.720
You mean that foot odour thing?

07:28.400 --> 07:30.470
The other curse.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.950
See, the minute a Bundy
starts having good luck...

07:33.160 --> 07:37.039
...he immediately starts to build up
an equal amount of bad luck.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.834
It's simple Bundy-nomics.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.068
For example...

07:42.320 --> 07:45.312
...when I was 18 and scored
four touchdowns in one game...

07:45.560 --> 07:48.950
...I became the greatest football
player in the history of Polk High.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.790
And what bad thing
happened after that?

07:56.800 --> 07:59.872
Like I'm the one that said,
"Al, show no ambition.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.556
We can live off of your income
of rocks and leaves."

08:04.680 --> 08:06.910
There is nothing wrong
with having good luck.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.476
Yes, there is. And you know what's
worse than a Bundy having good luck?

08:11.160 --> 08:14.596
A Bundy wearing Speedos
while having good luck?

08:19.440 --> 08:21.476
Good guess, Peg. No.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.676
A Bundy admitting
he's having good luck...

08:23.920 --> 08:25.876
...because that's
when the bad luck starts.

08:26.760 --> 08:30.309
Look, I don't care what you say.
Good luck is a-coming.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.389
- Peg, you won't believe this.
- I know, Al.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.791
A fat woman came
in the shoe store today.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.798
No, actually, an attractive woman
came in today.

08:43.039 --> 08:46.669
Nothing but attractive women
came in today.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.430
So, what you're trying to say
is that you had a good day?

08:50.680 --> 08:53.069
No! You know I can't say that.

08:53.320 --> 08:56.756
It was okay, that's all.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.750
I hit every green light.

09:02.040 --> 09:06.079
All the songs on the oldie station
were some of my all-time favourites.

09:06.480 --> 09:09.313
A cop pulled me over
and told me my taillight was out.

09:09.560 --> 09:11.152
Gave me his.

09:16.160 --> 09:17.832
But I wouldn't say it was a good day.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.439
Well, here's some more good news
you won't wanna hear about.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.353
It seems that Kelly is gonna
appear as the Verminator...

09:24.600 --> 09:26.318
...at Bud's homecoming rally.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.711
A few more gigs like this
and she will be able to move out soon.

09:29.920 --> 09:33.310
Yeah, well, how about Bud?
He didn't get in that fraternity, did he?

09:33.560 --> 09:37.712
No. Fraternities have standards
and they have traditions, you know?

09:46.480 --> 09:48.948
Gamma gamma sigma pi

09:49.200 --> 09:51.634
Gonna, gonna get some thigh

09:55.520 --> 09:56.589
I'm in.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.713
Words a male Bundy
has never uttered before.

10:04.840 --> 10:05.795
It's gonna be great.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.630
This time tomorrow I'll be into
the frat house and out of the rat house.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.872
- No offence.
- None taken.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.158
Oh, by the way, Dad.

10:17.400 --> 10:21.791
They made me scrub all the toilets
with a toothbrush, so I borrowed yours.

10:25.280 --> 10:28.317
Well, at least the part about
the toothbrush was bad luck.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.915
No, Peg, this is good luck.

10:31.160 --> 10:32.912
This is yours.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.948
All these good things happening,
the kids moving out.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.516
I'm doomed.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.508
Hi, Daddy.

11:20.760 --> 11:22.159
Are things still going well?

11:23.080 --> 11:25.355
I'm afraid so, pumpkin.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.519
I'm sorry.

11:27.760 --> 11:29.193
It's okay.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.829
I wish you would come
to the homecoming rally tonight.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.715
Been working on a special entrance.
I'm gonna ride this Harley up a ramp...

11:35.920 --> 11:40.232
...jump over a bonfire pit and then
light the flames with my exhaust.

11:42.120 --> 11:45.510
Kelly, just exactly how did you learn
to do stunts like this?

11:45.760 --> 11:47.910
In your car, ditching the police.

11:50.280 --> 11:53.909
- How'd you learn to build a bunker?
- In bed, ditching your mom.

11:58.960 --> 12:01.235
Sweetheart, I really would love to go...

12:01.440 --> 12:04.113
...but with all this good luck
I'm afraid to leave the fort.

12:04.320 --> 12:08.757
Something good will happen and then
I'll be in for a fate worse than death.

12:08.960 --> 12:12.236
But considering I'm married to
your mother, a fate worse than life.

12:13.040 --> 12:14.917
Well, I'll make you
proud of me, Daddy.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.470
You know what the great thing is?
Career-wise? This is just a start.

12:18.680 --> 12:22.309
You know, like Michael Jackson
before he became Diana Ross.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.153
I mean, I know I'm just
a local mascot now...

12:30.400 --> 12:34.791
...but with a little luck I could be a
dancing fruit in somebody's underwear.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.715
Well, better you than Bud.

12:39.560 --> 12:42.233
- Go away. Go away.
- Okay.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.356
Yeah, that'll be the Grim Reaper.

12:47.240 --> 12:49.356
- Hey, Kel.
- Hi.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.191
- Break a leg.
- Pass a stone.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.878
Oh, Al. Remodelling?

13:04.080 --> 13:06.719
If you throw in a couple
of ears of corn and some mud...

13:06.920 --> 13:09.992
...you'd have a mighty fine sty.

13:10.720 --> 13:11.994
Jefferson, don't look now...

13:12.200 --> 13:15.670
...but something followed you home
from El Pollo Loco.

13:20.320 --> 13:22.834
I heard you've been having
a run of good luck lately.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.436
Too bad it hasn't extended
to the hair fairy.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.791
- Where's Peggy?
- Bud's leaving tonight...

13:30.000 --> 13:34.152
...so she's upstairs converting his
room into a tabloid reading lounge.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.156
I'm gonna take this camera to her.
She wants pictures of Kelly tonight.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.157
What happened to my camera?

13:40.400 --> 13:43.949
What you refer to as "your" camera
was actually our camera.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.714
Much as what you refer to as your
garbage can...

13:46.960 --> 13:49.554
...is actually our backyard.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.395
Plucky little gal, isn't she?

13:54.160 --> 13:56.469
Yeah, but she makes money.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.909
Anyway, I've been a little worried about
this lucky streak you've been having.

14:07.120 --> 14:10.078
It might wear off before I've had
a chance to take advantage.

14:10.720 --> 14:13.792
- Hells bells, we can't have that.
- Agreed.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.595
So naturally, I just happen to know
a few well-heeled rubes...

14:17.800 --> 14:19.711
...always in the mood
for a poker game.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.559
Oh, that's a good idea.
I'd better check my cash reserve.

14:22.800 --> 14:26.349
Well, maybe I'd better call my broker,
E.F. Nutton.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.753
Not to worry, Al. You are having
such a run of good luck.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.389
That's why Marcie and I
will be happy to stake you.

14:37.640 --> 14:41.110
All you have to do is not tell Marcie.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.431
And you and I will split the winnings.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.877
- But Jefferson, I'm cursed.
- Fine. We won't tell Peggy either.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.032
No. But it's...
It's all this good luck I'm having.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.874
See, if I won a big poker game
I'd be dead.

14:53.120 --> 14:55.918
I'm sorry, but I gotta
look out for number one here.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.752
No amount of money is worth my life.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.117
- What if we get you a big-screen TV?
- I'm in.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.194
Full house, cowboys over nines.

15:06.480 --> 15:10.758
Can you believe this guy's luck?
He ain't lost a hand all night.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.116
I say we shoot him.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.795
Shooting these days is so childish.

15:17.040 --> 15:19.600
I am up for a good beating though.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.717
Jefferson, is it me or are your friends
getting a little touchy?

15:23.960 --> 15:25.951
Relax, Al. I know these guys.

15:26.160 --> 15:29.596
- They talk big but never hurt anyone.
- Good.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.950
- Where'd you meet them?
- Prison.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.557
- Hi, Peggy.
- Incoming.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.119
I'm ready to go.

15:38.840 --> 15:42.196
Jefferson D'Arcy, are you gambling?

15:42.960 --> 15:45.315
No, honeybunch.

15:45.560 --> 15:49.519
I'm just having my environmental
sensitivity meeting.

15:49.760 --> 15:50.988
And as a matter of fact...

15:51.240 --> 15:57.315
...this is our guest speaker, Dr. William
"The Weasel" Sullivan. Doc?

16:01.160 --> 16:05.312
Yes, ma'am.
Tonight our focus is on Oregon.

16:05.560 --> 16:09.314
Where the logging industry keeps
raping the old-growth forest...

16:09.560 --> 16:13.997
...which the endangered spotted owl
depends on for sanctuary.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.190
Jefferson, I'm so ashamed.

16:21.440 --> 16:23.237
How can I make it up to you?

16:23.440 --> 16:25.556
Oh, I'll survive, Marcie.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.519
It's the little owls I'm worried about.

16:28.840 --> 16:32.389
Well, I give a hoot.
Maybe this can help.

16:32.920 --> 16:36.469
Thanks, Marcy. I'll see that this
is put to good use.

16:36.960 --> 16:39.838
Oh, Peggy, come on.
These men have important work to do.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.833
All men do.
Too bad they aren't better at it.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.399
Hey, Weasel.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.518
I'm impressed. How'd you know
all that about the spotted owl?

16:50.760 --> 16:55.197
Well, we bury a lot of our guys
in the northwest.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.115
And we care.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.039
Well, I'm tapped.

17:09.280 --> 17:11.236
Come on, guys. Let's hit the road.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.755
I say we hit Bundy and then the road.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.388
Hey, hey, what are we,
a bunch of wimps?

17:16.640 --> 17:21.156
No. A bunch of pissed off ex-cons
who don't like people calling us wimps.

17:22.640 --> 17:23.867
Okay, I'll tell you what.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.792
Least we can do is give you
a chance to even things out.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.554
How you gonna do that?
You got all our money.

17:30.160 --> 17:33.550
Yeah, but you still have
one thing left to get it back.

17:33.800 --> 17:34.949
Our guns?

17:35.880 --> 17:37.791
Okay, two things.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.197
I was thinking of your cars.

17:42.080 --> 17:47.359
Jefferson, this is something you should
know. I don't own the D-O-D-G-E.

17:48.880 --> 17:52.759
You don't need to.
Okay, boys, here's the deal.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.872
We'll play one hand.
All of Al's winnings...

17:56.120 --> 17:59.556
...against all of your cars.
What do you say?

18:01.000 --> 18:04.993
Jefferson. If I lose will you
still get me my big-screen TV?

18:05.240 --> 18:07.356
Sure, buddy.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.711
The biggest.

18:11.480 --> 18:12.993
All right, let the game begin.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.470
- I'm in.
- Me too.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.708
Hello Kitty?

18:25.200 --> 18:27.077
Well, yeah, it looks funny.

18:27.320 --> 18:29.834
But it feels really good in my pocket.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.439
Excuse me.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.792
I'm going to Disneyland!

19:15.680 --> 19:17.636
Okay. Who needs cards?

19:17.880 --> 19:19.791
- I'll take two.
- Two.

19:20.040 --> 19:22.076
- Give me three.
- Three.

19:22.320 --> 19:23.309
- One.
- One.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.869
- And Al stands...
- Four.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.395
Excuse me?

19:29.360 --> 19:32.079
I had to. I was getting that
same feeling of dread I get...

19:32.280 --> 19:34.510
...when Peggy finishes
reading a romance novel.

19:34.720 --> 19:38.110
Nobody gets a hand like that. I'd have
been cursed for the rest of my life.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.118
All ten minutes of it.
Now give me four.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.914
- Two pair.
- Three tens.

19:48.160 --> 19:52.199
I got you both beat. Flush. Bundy?

20:04.160 --> 20:08.119
He's got four aces. I win! I win!

20:15.480 --> 20:17.755
Oh, God, I love you.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.997
I hope those are chips
in your pocket.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.677
Mostly.

20:32.080 --> 20:34.833
Well, wait a second, Jefferson.
Look what happened.

20:35.080 --> 20:37.150
I won and nothing bad happened.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.515
Nothing.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.598
The curse is over.
For 40 years in the darkness...

20:41.800 --> 20:44.678
...finally I can lift my head up
into the light and proclaim...

20:44.880 --> 20:47.553
...to one and all
that Al Bundy is a winner!

20:50.600 --> 20:54.354
- Hands up. This is a raid.
- Of course.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.309
All right.

20:56.520 --> 21:00.195
Who owns the Mercedes, the BMW
and the Porsche parked out front?

21:00.400 --> 21:02.152
He does!

21:05.760 --> 21:09.116
Well, we're running a make
on the plates.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.590
I think they're all stolen.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.671
I'm sure of it.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.432
Officer, could you do me a favour
and turn on the TV?

21:17.640 --> 21:20.029
- Why?
- Just a hunch.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.517
Tonight our TV Ten cameras...

21:24.760 --> 21:28.435
...caught one of the most spectacular
accidents in Chicago history.

21:28.680 --> 21:29.999
Here we go.

21:30.240 --> 21:32.754
A young girl dressed
as the Verminator...

21:33.000 --> 21:35.992
...was temporarily blinded
by a red-headed woman...

21:36.240 --> 21:39.471
...taking a flash photo of her
as she jumped over a bonfire...

21:39.720 --> 21:41.676
...on a motorcycle.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.509
Al Bundy, this is your life.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.789
Upon landing...

21:46.000 --> 21:48.958
...she crashed into a nearby
fraternity house, igniting a fire...

21:49.200 --> 21:54.228
...which will force fraternity members
to move back home for the semester.

21:57.040 --> 22:00.953
No one is sure at this time
which fraternity was destroyed.

22:01.200 --> 22:03.156
Oh, I'm sure.

22:03.760 --> 22:06.593
Fortunately,
the Verminator escaped injury...

22:06.840 --> 22:08.671
...but since she had no insurance...

22:08.920 --> 22:13.755
...someone will be paying
for the damage for a long time.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.910
But not with those
winnings, eh, officer?

22:17.360 --> 22:19.112
What winnings?

22:20.400 --> 22:21.913
My mistake.

22:22.160 --> 22:23.752
Let's go.

22:24.200 --> 22:27.829
Well, at least this curse is over.
I'm a free man.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.838
Lock me up.

22:30.360 --> 22:33.636
And for tonight's weather.
Balmy and clear.

22:33.880 --> 22:35.996
A perfect Chicago night.

22:39.600 --> 22:43.354
Except over one man's house.
