01:23.048 --> 01:24.917
I know. I know.

01:35.686 --> 01:37.887
Hey, man. It's been a while.

01:39.565 --> 01:41.190
Land anywhere yet?

01:41.191 --> 01:43.274
- No.
- Yeah, it's tough out there.

01:44.403 --> 01:46.521
Well, they say it's coming back.

01:47.322 --> 01:49.109
Not for me, it's not.

01:55.998 --> 01:57.165
I'm sorry.

02:36.455 --> 02:37.992
Put the gun down!

02:37.998 --> 02:40.080
Somebody had to do something.

02:40.250 --> 02:41.878
Don't do it!

03:24.586 --> 03:27.588
The FDA has approved Denning
Pharmaceutical's new wonder drug.

03:27.589 --> 03:30.341
Another blockbuster quarter
for Denning Pharmaceutical...

03:30.342 --> 03:33.469
The news that the company's
new drug Prophidil,

03:33.470 --> 03:35.721
is on the fast track
to FDA approval.

03:35.723 --> 03:38.808
A major class action suit
against Denning Pharmaceutical

03:38.809 --> 03:40.768
is gaining momentum on allegations

03:40.769 --> 03:43.980
that the company had evidence that
its flagship drug, Prophidil,

03:43.981 --> 03:46.182
has potentially fatal side effects.

04:53.717 --> 04:55.426
No, I'm on my way
to the office now.

04:55.427 --> 04:57.095
You can't put yourself in danger.

04:57.096 --> 04:59.055
In danger? No, no,
I'm not in danger.

04:59.056 --> 05:00.264
The news said he
worked for Denning,

05:00.265 --> 05:01.432
isn't that the case you're on?

05:01.433 --> 05:03.059
He killed seven people.

05:03.060 --> 05:05.186
Yeah, including himself.
So, I think I'm safe.

05:05.187 --> 05:07.897
Though I think he may have ruined any
chance of my getting a promotion.

05:07.898 --> 05:09.899
- How come?
- He screwed me.

05:09.900 --> 05:11.651
- What do you mean?
- 'Cause he was our key witness.

05:11.652 --> 05:12.902
You don't have other witnesses?

05:12.903 --> 05:15.029
Yeah, but without him,
the whole case is a bust.

05:15.030 --> 05:17.240
I know, I'm not an expert, but
you wanna hear what I think?

05:17.241 --> 05:18.407
Of course, I do. Talk to me.

05:18.409 --> 05:20.034
I think you need a security detail.

05:20.035 --> 05:21.369
Someone should make
sure that you're okay.

05:21.370 --> 05:23.079
You're good.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.832
- Interesting, interesting.
- Will you get reassigned?

05:25.833 --> 05:28.960
I hope so, I wrote a memo on the
Gambizzi case I'm turning in today.

05:28.961 --> 05:30.253
That's great.

05:30.254 --> 05:32.088
Yeah, I should be on
Gambizzi by lunch.

05:32.089 --> 05:33.881
Mom, I gotta go, I gotta go.
I'm running late.

05:33.882 --> 05:36.000
- Love you.
- I love you too.

05:47.312 --> 05:49.814
Excuse me, sorry.
I just gotta... Sorry.

05:49.815 --> 05:52.942
I need to get through.
Thank you. Okay.

05:52.943 --> 05:54.694
Thanks.

06:12.337 --> 06:14.503
Tom. It's Monday.

06:14.798 --> 06:16.086
I knew that.

06:17.634 --> 06:19.752
- Tom.
- Janine.

06:20.637 --> 06:22.138
So what's going on in there?

06:22.139 --> 06:23.806
The servers went down in
Kansas City last night.

06:23.807 --> 06:25.975
- We lost all off-site backups.
- Oh.

06:25.976 --> 06:27.518
You're gonna be making
copies all day long.

06:27.519 --> 06:29.854
Yay, I love making copies.

06:29.855 --> 06:31.355
- Really?
- Not really. Where's Emmerich?

06:31.356 --> 06:32.565
Hmm, on the warpath.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.732
- I gotta get this to Moyers.
- Got it.

06:34.777 --> 06:36.152
Why don't you take
the scenic route?

06:36.153 --> 06:38.405
- And don't let him see you.
- I love you, Janine.

06:40.741 --> 06:42.492
- You're all set.
- I love you too, Barney.

06:42.493 --> 06:44.160
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

06:44.161 --> 06:45.449
Thank you.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.541
- Ooh!
- Oh!

06:50.542 --> 06:52.293
Jefe!

06:52.711 --> 06:54.629
Donna, your lunch
appointment has arrived.

06:54.630 --> 06:55.923
She's in the waiting area.

06:56.340 --> 06:58.466
We need to update our
file on the Pamona case.

06:58.467 --> 06:59.759
Per our conversation this morning,

06:59.760 --> 07:01.886
I finally convinced Munson
to get off the dime.

07:01.887 --> 07:03.638
He's agreed to extend
an offered settlement

07:03.639 --> 07:06.140
to the amount of 1.5,
structured over three years.

07:06.141 --> 07:07.475
First payment due at signing.

07:07.476 --> 07:10.603
Tell him we'll agree to it. If he
tries to counter, shut him down.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.188
I need the Amato file.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.471
Here.

07:16.151 --> 07:18.194
Give this to Murray and
get it back to me.

07:18.195 --> 07:21.155
He's got to initial it by
noon today. Thank you.

07:27.329 --> 07:28.700
You notice I'm never late.

07:28.997 --> 07:31.163
And I've got two kids.

07:31.333 --> 07:34.295
I wondered why you had all those
pictures of children on your desk.

07:35.462 --> 07:36.702
Oh, shit.

07:52.104 --> 07:53.593
Tom!

07:53.939 --> 07:55.940
- Get this filed away.
- Yes, sir, right away.

07:55.941 --> 08:00.194
I also need 20 copies of each of these
for the Harcourt presentation tomorrow.

08:00.529 --> 08:01.863
Also... Sorry, hi.

08:01.864 --> 08:05.408
I went ahead and I included
Prophidil heart attack victims, uh,

08:05.409 --> 08:07.618
along with the stroke patients
already in the class.

08:07.619 --> 08:09.579
Case goes to trial tomorrow.

08:09.580 --> 08:12.081
Our lead witness decided to
go on a suicidal rampage

08:12.082 --> 08:13.499
at the defendant's
office on Tuesday.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.084
So I don't have time
for innovation.

08:15.085 --> 08:17.211
One motion, and it's done.

08:17.212 --> 08:19.213
And defense won't mind 'cause
they're gonna be hearing from

08:19.214 --> 08:21.629
- the heart attacks sooner or later anyway.
- Tom...

08:21.675 --> 08:25.383
We work off a 40 cut of whatever
the court awards the plaintiffs.

08:25.679 --> 08:28.972
Lifetime care cost of each
stroke victim is millions.

08:30.017 --> 08:33.019
Burial cost of your heart
attack victim is 10,000 bucks.

08:33.020 --> 08:34.852
Got it, got it.

08:35.230 --> 08:37.727
You think you're doing
the right thing, Tom.

08:38.232 --> 08:40.693
The one great aspect of
this justice system is that

08:40.693 --> 08:43.227
there is a market for
all kinds of cases.

08:43.322 --> 08:47.030
Large firms, like us, will take
care of the expensive victims.

08:47.576 --> 08:50.620
Small ones can take care
of your heart attacks.

08:55.793 --> 08:57.495
Psst! Tom!

08:58.253 --> 09:00.086
I think he likes you.

09:01.423 --> 09:02.757
It doesn't matter anyway.

09:02.758 --> 09:05.551
The case is a bust after the
whistleblower went postal.

09:05.552 --> 09:09.347
No case is a bust when you're billing
out a $12 an hour paralegal,

09:09.348 --> 09:11.140
at $65 an hour.

09:11.141 --> 09:15.846
Christ, Roger, they're only
paying you $12 an hour? Ouch!

09:17.773 --> 09:19.732
Now we'll preview the
unredacted versions...

09:19.733 --> 09:23.145
Jack, meet your client in
conference room B, please.

09:23.779 --> 09:25.113
Your memo's on Moyers' desk.

09:25.114 --> 09:28.323
Oh, you're my hero...
Heroine, heroine.

09:32.496 --> 09:33.819
This is Tom.

09:35.582 --> 09:37.250
Yes, sir, right away.

09:39.545 --> 09:42.255
Looks like I'm gonna be joining
you on the Gambizzi case.

09:42.256 --> 09:43.923
Oh, yeah? How's that?

09:43.924 --> 09:46.467
I submitted a memo this morning.

09:46.468 --> 09:49.178
Moyers wants to see
me in his office.

09:49.179 --> 09:51.097
Hey, uh, speaking of heart attacks,

09:51.098 --> 09:55.059
she is wearing the form fitted
gray thing that is just...

09:55.060 --> 09:56.769
- You're so gross, Roger.
- ...unbelievable.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.770
You gonna talk to her this time?

09:59.022 --> 10:01.022
If you do, tell her I
want my boxers back.

10:04.653 --> 10:05.941
He's ready for you.

10:07.239 --> 10:08.562
- Tom?
- Yeah.

10:08.574 --> 10:09.861
Shirt's untucked.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.862
Come in.

10:16.039 --> 10:17.540
You wanna see me, sir?

10:17.541 --> 10:19.959
Yeah, Tom, hey! Thanks for
coming. Here, take a seat.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.627
Thanks.

10:23.505 --> 10:24.756
Never been in here before.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.215
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's cool.

10:26.216 --> 10:29.552
Yeah, it's nice, huh?
225 square feet.

10:29.553 --> 10:31.262
- Nice.
- And fifth biggest office in the building.

10:31.263 --> 10:32.472
Yeah.

10:32.473 --> 10:36.015
So, Tom, this memo on Gambizzi...

10:36.143 --> 10:39.228
It's all your own work? No one
helped you or advised you?

10:39.229 --> 10:40.932
It's a fascinating case.

10:41.607 --> 10:43.232
Yes.

10:43.233 --> 10:45.818
I really feel like there's a spousal
privilege aspect to the case

10:45.819 --> 10:47.111
that's been overlooked.

10:47.112 --> 10:50.239
And so I hope the memo helps
shed some light on different...

10:57.748 --> 11:00.079
I don't understand.

11:00.918 --> 11:04.629
Tom, when you neglect the
cases that we assign you,

11:04.630 --> 11:06.214
you neglect the client.

11:06.215 --> 11:09.717
Without the client,
all of this, it disappears.

11:09.718 --> 11:11.511
Gambizzi's small fry.

11:11.512 --> 11:14.181
It's cases like Harcourt v.
Denning that keep the lights on.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.759
- I understand.
- Do you?

11:18.644 --> 11:20.679
Emmerich wants a follow-up
with you later.

11:21.146 --> 11:23.098
Awesome. Thanks.

11:24.608 --> 11:26.359
Yeah, anytime, Tom.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.918
Mr. Ryan, please hold
for Miss Higgins.

11:43.919 --> 11:46.416
Mr. Ryan, please hold
for Miss Higgins.

12:11.029 --> 12:12.898
So long, Harcourt.

12:45.022 --> 12:47.437
- Oh, hey, Thomas.
- Oh, hey, Anna.

12:47.858 --> 12:51.815
The Xerox machines in the copy room
were all occupied so I just...

12:52.863 --> 12:56.324
Oh, well, I noticed some files out of place
the other day, so can I show you those?

12:56.325 --> 12:58.490
Yeah, that's... Yeah.

13:04.833 --> 13:06.750
- You said you quit.
- Tough day.

13:06.919 --> 13:08.169
Moyers didn't like the memo?

13:08.170 --> 13:10.338
He shredded it, in front of me.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.923
Thanks for the support.

13:16.845 --> 13:18.012
How's that for support?

13:18.013 --> 13:19.430
That's a little better.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.015
The guy's a total loser.

13:21.016 --> 13:22.558
You should seriously not
care what he thinks.

13:22.559 --> 13:24.435
Yeah, I don't care what he thinks.

13:24.436 --> 13:27.350
I do care what Emmerich thinks.

13:29.858 --> 13:32.069
Now he wants to follow up
with me this afternoon.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.947
Okay. Okay, here's what you do.

13:35.948 --> 13:41.114
You apologize, you act sincere, and
then you forget it ever happened, okay?

13:42.996 --> 13:45.331
- Don't take it personally.
- I know.

13:45.332 --> 13:47.542
Listen, everyone's always gonna
have to answer to someone.

13:47.543 --> 13:48.918
Emmerich doesn't.

13:48.919 --> 13:51.129
- Ever met his wife?
- Well, that's true.

13:52.464 --> 13:56.050
Good news is I get fired, we
can stop sneaking around.

13:56.051 --> 13:58.087
You get fired, and I'm dumping you.

14:01.932 --> 14:03.172
That wasn't funny.

14:05.436 --> 14:06.644
So not funny, not
funny, not right now.

14:06.645 --> 14:07.770
It's kind of.

14:07.771 --> 14:09.939
Come on, babe, it's kind of funny.

14:09.940 --> 14:11.607
Come here.

14:13.318 --> 14:15.520
- You're so mean.
- Shh.

14:24.538 --> 14:27.072
I gotta get that.

14:28.834 --> 14:31.035
Hey, don't take it personally.

14:34.298 --> 14:36.001
Chin up.

14:44.808 --> 14:46.926
How many of those do they need?

14:52.524 --> 14:53.764
Hey, hey!

15:12.669 --> 15:14.041
I'm sorry.

15:35.484 --> 15:37.484
Okay, everybody listen up.

15:38.487 --> 15:42.942
RBE goes to trial against Denning
Pharmaceutical tomorrow.

15:43.158 --> 15:47.453
I don't need to remind you what a big
day it's going to be for all of us.

15:47.454 --> 15:50.706
I know how frustrating it's
been having the servers down.

15:50.707 --> 15:54.119
There's not a lot more work
we can get done tonight.

15:54.670 --> 15:57.369
I want everybody to go home.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.301
- Tom.
- Yes, sir.

16:12.896 --> 16:16.308
The memo you wrote on Gambizzi
references the witness list.

16:17.443 --> 16:19.902
If I hadn't caught this before
all our discovery was filed,

16:19.903 --> 16:22.196
it would have been submitted
to the district clerk.

16:22.197 --> 16:24.699
That exhibit would have been
unsealed, allowing access

16:24.700 --> 16:28.661
to the names and addresses of everyone
who's turning state's evidence

16:28.662 --> 16:31.077
against the Gambizzi crime family.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.452
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

16:35.002 --> 16:36.835
You're a paralegal.

16:37.004 --> 16:39.999
There's a lot you don't know, but
I don't have a problem with that.

16:40.299 --> 16:41.622
Hmm.

16:41.884 --> 16:44.630
I do have a problem with
you acting like you do.

16:47.306 --> 16:49.840
This is your last day at RBE, Tom.

17:09.494 --> 17:12.823
Tom. I'm sorry.

17:28.430 --> 17:29.837
Sorry.

17:31.433 --> 17:34.143
- Hey, Mom.
- Babe, I'm so sorry.

17:34.144 --> 17:35.353
It's okay.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.230
Let's go get a drink tonight,
okay? Just you and me.

17:37.231 --> 17:38.439
Okay.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.566
I'm heading out now, but meet me
at Mahoney's at like 11:00, okay?

17:40.567 --> 17:41.974
Bye.

17:42.361 --> 17:45.029
- Moving back in with mom and dad?
- Something like that.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.489
- Hey, Tom.
- Barney.

17:46.490 --> 17:47.698
Sorry to hear what happened, man.

17:47.699 --> 17:49.071
Appreciate it. I'll miss you, pal.

17:49.118 --> 17:51.204
You'll always have
memories of the file room.

17:51.412 --> 17:52.783
Pass card log.

17:52.788 --> 17:54.241
She was never far behind you.

17:57.084 --> 17:59.127
What was he talking about?

17:59.128 --> 18:02.422
- I've maybe, possibly been seeing Anna.
- What?

18:02.423 --> 18:04.340
For like, three months.

18:04.341 --> 18:05.842
Oh, my God.

18:05.843 --> 18:07.427
You're not serious.

18:07.428 --> 18:08.594
Ugh!

18:08.595 --> 18:10.132
I wanna get fired.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.433
Oh, you know what?
I'll take the next one.

18:13.434 --> 18:14.642
I gotta grab something on my desk.

18:14.643 --> 18:16.769
- You want me to wait for you?
- No, no, go ahead.

18:16.770 --> 18:19.684
- Go see your secret girlfriend.
- Ha-ha.

18:33.287 --> 18:34.574
Hey.

20:16.056 --> 20:18.388
Didn't waste any time.

20:44.543 --> 20:45.668
Hey, Frank.

20:45.669 --> 20:47.879
This isn't working.
Can you swipe me up?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.793
- You got it, boss.
- I'll just leave this here for two seconds.

22:29.189 --> 22:30.477
Hey, Jefe.

22:30.649 --> 22:33.111
You didn't see a guy walking
around in a suit, did you?

22:34.528 --> 22:35.899
Yeah.

22:58.635 --> 23:01.086
What are you doing at my desk, pal?

23:18.655 --> 23:20.821
They canceled my pass card.

23:25.871 --> 23:27.747
- Hey!
- Hey, stupid pass card's not working.

23:27.748 --> 23:29.285
Oh, okay.

23:29.833 --> 23:33.375
- So you're still here?
- Yeah, yeah, I tried to leave but, uh...

23:34.171 --> 23:36.881
I just had a lot of work
I had to catch up on.

23:36.882 --> 23:39.342
Hey, you didn't see a lawyer
walking around here, did you?

23:39.343 --> 23:41.552
No. Why?

23:41.553 --> 23:44.472
What are you still doing here?

23:44.473 --> 23:47.054
- Just wanted one more look at the place.
- Oh.

23:48.394 --> 23:50.686
So what are you working on?

23:50.687 --> 23:55.854
Oh, you know what, uh, Emmerich is
really invested in that Gambizzi case.

23:55.984 --> 23:59.904
- So he's got me working here late.
- Right, right, right, right.

23:59.905 --> 24:01.489
Argh!

24:03.367 --> 24:04.826
Yep!

24:04.827 --> 24:06.066
Tom!

24:06.286 --> 24:07.658
Get this filed away.

24:21.427 --> 24:22.666
All right.

24:23.762 --> 24:25.346
I'm really gone this time.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.223
Okay.

24:27.224 --> 24:28.724
You want me to let you out?

24:28.726 --> 24:31.519
No, I'll take the scenic
route, old time's sake.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.009
All right.

24:34.314 --> 24:36.646
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

24:38.318 --> 24:39.527
Take care.

24:39.528 --> 24:42.987
Yeah. Don't work too hard
on that Gambizzi case.

25:15.814 --> 25:17.814
Can I help you with something?

25:23.155 --> 25:26.199
I'm with contractor services.

25:26.784 --> 25:28.901
They sent me up to fix a short.

25:29.286 --> 25:30.453
You mean building maintenance?

25:30.454 --> 25:32.205
That's it.

25:32.206 --> 25:33.706
Oh, well, no one told
me anything about it.

25:33.707 --> 25:35.992
Um, do you mind if
I see your badge?

25:36.502 --> 25:37.741
I forgot it.

25:40.881 --> 25:42.467
They called me up at last minute.

25:42.966 --> 25:45.095
I just wanna get this
done and get out of here.

25:45.302 --> 25:48.465
Oh, I'm gonna have to
call Jerry about this.

25:53.060 --> 25:54.811
Let's not bother Jerry.

25:54.812 --> 25:56.847
What did you say your name...

26:30.556 --> 26:32.673
Come on you, let's go.

26:32.933 --> 26:35.265
You're not helping, are you?

26:53.203 --> 26:55.036
Come on, Tom.

26:55.372 --> 26:56.998
Who's in there?

26:56.999 --> 26:58.951
Hello. Excuse me?

27:03.380 --> 27:04.620
Barney?

28:11.365 --> 28:12.990
How you doing in there, Barney?

28:12.991 --> 28:14.943
You wanna toss me your keys?

28:17.037 --> 28:18.665
I promise to take good care of it.

28:37.516 --> 28:41.722
Okay, I'll have these.
Thank you, Barney.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.074
Stay there.

29:56.678 --> 29:57.845
- Tom!
- Roger.

29:57.846 --> 29:59.514
- What are you still doing here?
- Keep your voice down.

29:59.515 --> 30:00.723
- Keep my voice down?
- There's a guy

30:00.724 --> 30:01.974
on the floor, he just
killed Janine and Barney.

30:01.975 --> 30:03.101
What are you talking about?

30:03.102 --> 30:04.352
Roger, we gotta go.
We gotta get out of here.

30:04.353 --> 30:05.728
Okay, well, what did he look like?

30:05.729 --> 30:08.397
I don't know. Six foot,
180, he's wearing a suit.

30:08.399 --> 30:10.232
That's everyone in this city.

30:39.096 --> 30:40.419
(PANTING)

30:43.434 --> 30:44.887
It's dead.

30:55.571 --> 30:57.273
Janine.

31:03.537 --> 31:04.787
Shit!

31:04.788 --> 31:07.206
Shit! We're trapped.

31:07.207 --> 31:10.418
Look, he doesn't know we're here. Worst
case scenario, we hide out till he leaves.

31:10.419 --> 31:12.953
Worst case scenario is he
finds us and kills us.

31:15.382 --> 31:17.300
Get on a computer, see if you
can get online or something.

31:17.301 --> 31:18.885
Okay.

31:46.497 --> 31:48.947
- Tom, the Internet...
- Shut up!

32:53.188 --> 32:55.565
Okay, here's the plan.

32:55.566 --> 32:58.067
Take the long route around to
the far side of the bullpen.

32:58.068 --> 32:59.569
Get to your desk, call the cops.

32:59.570 --> 33:00.987
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna find Emmerich.

33:00.988 --> 33:02.572
No, listen to me.

33:02.573 --> 33:05.366
Forget Emmerich. Forget doing
the right thing for once.

33:05.367 --> 33:06.659
He wouldn't save us.

33:06.660 --> 33:08.911
- God damn it...
- Roger, will you shut up and listen to me?

33:08.912 --> 33:10.746
None of that matters now, okay?

33:10.748 --> 33:12.665
You have kids at home,
keep it together.

33:12.666 --> 33:14.369
Let's go.

33:21.842 --> 33:23.082
Give me this.

33:25.012 --> 33:27.842
Hey, hey, hey!

33:28.432 --> 33:30.935
This isn't how I thought my
day was going to go, either.

33:30.976 --> 33:34.771
So you're gonna take the one pass card
we have, you're gonna find a phone,

33:34.772 --> 33:36.898
I'm gonna get Emmerich, and we're
gonna get out of here, okay?

33:36.899 --> 33:38.775
- Okay.
- Okay?

33:38.776 --> 33:40.015
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:06.470 --> 34:08.755
Where'd you go?

34:22.360 --> 34:23.860
Hi, honey.

34:23.862 --> 34:26.697
- Sarah, hey. It's me, listen, honey...
- Excuse me, sir.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.991
Honey, do you want me to
keep your dinner warm?

34:28.992 --> 34:30.993
Hold on a second.

34:30.994 --> 34:32.786
Yes?

34:32.788 --> 34:34.956
I'm with building maintenance.

34:34.956 --> 34:36.415
How long do you think
you're gonna be?

34:36.417 --> 34:39.127
Okay, um... Thanks
for letting me know.

34:39.128 --> 34:41.170
- I'm just on the phone right now.
- I'll wait.

34:41.170 --> 34:43.621
Guys, quiet.
I'm talking to your dad.

34:45.592 --> 34:48.177
- Are you okay?
- Hey! No, I'm fine.

34:48.178 --> 34:52.306
I'm... I'm at the office and...

34:52.306 --> 34:54.183
I'm with someone right now.

34:54.184 --> 34:56.518
You got any idea how many other
people are working late tonight?

34:56.520 --> 34:57.687
- Hey, honey...
- Sir?

34:57.688 --> 35:00.273
Oh, Elaine and Mike invited us to
go to the lake again on Saturday.

35:00.274 --> 35:02.066
What do you want me to say to them?

35:02.067 --> 35:04.652
Need to make sure nobody's trapped.

35:04.653 --> 35:06.522
I'm out of excuses.

35:23.047 --> 35:27.300
Oh, your books from Amazon came
in today. They only sent two.

35:27.301 --> 35:30.428
Tell her you've been held up late
in office. You'll be home late.

35:30.429 --> 35:31.929
They didn't send the
restaurant guide.

35:31.930 --> 35:33.639
Hey, I'm, uh...

35:33.640 --> 35:37.016
I'm just stuck at the office,
I'm gonna be a little late.

35:42.566 --> 35:46.402
Tell her everything's fine.
Kiss the kids night-night.

35:46.403 --> 35:48.154
Are you sure everything's okay?

35:48.155 --> 35:51.483
No, no. Everything's
fine. Uh, just...

35:52.242 --> 35:54.076
Kiss the kids goodnight for me.

35:54.078 --> 35:55.453
Okay, well...

35:55.454 --> 35:57.664
Don't forget to tell
her you love her.

35:59.416 --> 36:01.000
I love you, baby.

36:01.001 --> 36:02.168
I love you too, honey.

36:02.169 --> 36:04.915
Now hang up and put the
phone on the desk.

36:18.268 --> 36:20.635
Oh, please. Please...

36:22.981 --> 36:25.525
I didn't see anything. I...

36:25.526 --> 36:30.064
Is anybody else
working late tonight?

36:32.783 --> 36:35.696
No, no, it was... It's just me.

36:36.286 --> 36:38.701
Good. Good.

37:22.291 --> 37:23.780
Roger?

37:55.532 --> 37:57.484
Come on, come on, come on.

37:59.787 --> 38:01.786
What the...

38:01.872 --> 38:03.160
Ugh.

38:03.499 --> 38:06.042
Come on. Come on.

38:06.043 --> 38:08.577
Oh, goddamn iPhones.

38:18.847 --> 38:21.095
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

39:23.370 --> 39:25.705
I need to talk to you,

39:25.706 --> 39:27.498
you have a problem.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.202
Call me back.

39:30.711 --> 39:32.330
Immediately.

39:51.148 --> 39:52.273
Shit.

39:59.990 --> 40:02.156
We have a situation.

40:02.284 --> 40:04.734
Nobody was supposed to be up here.

40:05.496 --> 40:06.996
Three.

40:06.997 --> 40:08.404
And the one we spoke about.

40:11.502 --> 40:13.628
I'll be in touch when it's done.

41:22.698 --> 41:24.531
Tom?

41:28.829 --> 41:30.366
Tom.

41:33.792 --> 41:35.958
Tom.

41:45.345 --> 41:48.970
You think this is a big office,
Tom, but it's about to get really,

41:49.683 --> 41:52.098
really small.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.813
There's only one way out.

41:58.609 --> 42:00.146
And I've got the key.

42:01.945 --> 42:04.277
I will find you, Tom.

42:05.282 --> 42:07.033
I'll find you.

42:07.034 --> 42:13.162
If I have to burn this place to
the ground, I will find you.

43:00.003 --> 43:01.243
Come on.

43:02.172 --> 43:03.460
Hey.

44:03.025 --> 44:06.068
Yes, come on, come on.
Pick up the phone, pick up the phone!

44:06.070 --> 44:07.938
Call the cops.

44:31.762 --> 44:33.262
Wait.

44:33.263 --> 44:35.973
I got it, I got it.

44:35.974 --> 44:38.684
There, look, "9-1-1 ."

44:38.685 --> 44:40.554
I got it, yes.

44:40.771 --> 44:43.019
Yes, I'm going to shoot
that kid in the face.

44:43.190 --> 44:45.640
Yes, I am. Yes.

45:50.424 --> 45:51.717
Come on.

45:54.178 --> 45:55.465
Oh, come on.

46:18.994 --> 46:20.483
Yes, yeah.

46:20.704 --> 46:21.944
Come on, come on.

46:23.332 --> 46:24.655
Yeah!

46:42.643 --> 46:43.966
Got you.

47:12.047 --> 47:13.833
Here goes nothing.

47:24.226 --> 47:26.308
- Tom.
- Thank Christ.

47:26.562 --> 47:27.895
Give me your cell phone.

47:27.896 --> 47:29.981
- What... What's going on?
- Excuse me, do you have a cell phone?

47:29.982 --> 47:31.315
- Tom.
- We have to call the cops.

47:31.316 --> 47:32.567
- Tom!
- There's a guy on the floor with a gun.

47:32.568 --> 47:34.777
He killed three people. Can
you hurry up and call 9-1-1?

47:34.778 --> 47:36.066
You said I'd be safe!

47:36.697 --> 47:38.697
Shit.

47:43.495 --> 47:45.913
- Alan Z. Emmerich?
- Oh, God!

47:45.914 --> 47:47.831
Please, don't.

47:48.959 --> 47:52.537
One of your employees, Tom,
reprogrammed the cards.

47:56.383 --> 47:58.926
Please tell me there's another
card reader on this floor.

47:58.927 --> 48:01.175
I don't believe so, no.

48:03.974 --> 48:05.262
Oh...

48:05.392 --> 48:10.393
This lawyer has started to seriously
affect my ability to do my job.

48:11.065 --> 48:12.440
He's just a paralegal.

48:12.441 --> 48:14.192
Let him go, he's nobody.

48:32.586 --> 48:35.250
Do not leave this office.

48:55.609 --> 48:57.276
Who is she?

48:58.362 --> 49:00.113
Lorraine Gambizzi.

49:02.116 --> 49:04.068
Gambizzi's wife?

49:05.702 --> 49:08.782
She was testifying
against her husband?

49:09.581 --> 49:11.749
That's why he's here.

49:11.750 --> 49:13.619
He must be one of Gambizzi's guys.

49:14.420 --> 49:16.917
But if she's dead,
why isn't he leaving?

49:17.131 --> 49:19.546
Maybe he is.

49:20.092 --> 49:21.795
Doesn't sound like it.

49:36.233 --> 49:37.473
What is he doing?

49:38.068 --> 49:40.150
What does he want in the file room?

49:40.571 --> 49:43.239
Well, he's not gonna
get in there that way.

49:43.240 --> 49:46.533
That's reinforced steel and bulletproof
glass. That's impenetrable.

49:46.744 --> 49:49.789
So the one room where we're safe is
the room where we can't get into.

50:09.224 --> 50:10.548
It stopped.

50:11.101 --> 50:12.685
Shit.

50:17.399 --> 50:18.853
Tom?

50:19.610 --> 50:21.147
Tom!

50:23.530 --> 50:25.656
Look who I got.

50:25.657 --> 50:27.408
Fernando.

50:27.534 --> 50:29.237
See?

50:31.622 --> 50:35.033
Tom, I just want to talk.

50:35.751 --> 50:37.335
That's all, see.

50:37.461 --> 50:39.253
I'm an employee.

50:39.254 --> 50:41.788
Just like you, I've been hired

50:41.965 --> 50:46.587
to do a job, and my boss isn't the
kind of man who accepts failure.

50:47.888 --> 50:50.588
Don't try and be a hero, Tom.

50:51.308 --> 50:53.509
Nobody else has to die.

50:54.895 --> 50:57.559
If you bring me the pass card,

50:58.148 --> 50:59.816
I promise,

51:00.692 --> 51:02.692
I won't hurt Fernando.

51:04.113 --> 51:05.602
If you don't...

51:07.658 --> 51:10.701
I will decorate that
wall with his brains.

51:11.870 --> 51:13.656
What's his nickname?

51:14.623 --> 51:16.374
What's his nickname?

51:16.375 --> 51:18.078
What do I call him?

51:19.920 --> 51:21.504
The janitor!

51:22.256 --> 51:23.875
He's already dead.

51:31.223 --> 51:33.839
It's been fun, Tom.

51:39.356 --> 51:40.644
What's that?

51:40.858 --> 51:43.189
He's turning the elevators back on.

51:45.028 --> 51:46.980
He's trying to trick us.

51:48.824 --> 51:50.443
Come on.

52:10.345 --> 52:11.882
Stay here.

52:41.085 --> 52:42.251
You heard it too?

52:42.252 --> 52:44.039
Jesus Christ.

52:57.226 --> 52:58.465
What is it?

52:59.269 --> 53:00.509
It's my number.

53:01.063 --> 53:02.303
Oh, shit!

53:13.200 --> 53:15.033
Go, go, go!

53:51.029 --> 53:53.943
Shit. Shit.

53:55.284 --> 53:56.524
Oh, God.

54:13.635 --> 54:14.923
This is gonna hurt.

54:15.054 --> 54:16.637
You ready?

54:25.105 --> 54:26.393
Nice phone.

54:41.747 --> 54:44.165
You really should protect
your phone with a PIN.

54:44.166 --> 54:46.451
You wouldn't want
just anyone using it.

54:57.012 --> 54:58.554
No!

54:58.555 --> 54:59.722
No!

54:59.723 --> 55:03.309
Hey, hey, hey, leave her out of this.
You already killed the other witness,

55:03.310 --> 55:05.354
why are you doing it?
Why are you still here?

55:08.399 --> 55:09.686
I'm gonna go let her in.

55:10.234 --> 55:13.728
You got everything you wanted,
why are you doing this?

55:13.737 --> 55:15.274
Not everything.

55:17.157 --> 55:19.784
Hey! Hey, come back here!

55:19.785 --> 55:21.536
Hey, come back here
and listen to me!

55:21.537 --> 55:22.995
You touch her, I'm gonna kill you.

55:22.996 --> 55:24.664
Get back here!

55:24.665 --> 55:26.451
Hey! Hey!

55:29.253 --> 55:30.753
What are you doing?

55:30.754 --> 55:33.039
- Don't go out there.
- I have to.

55:33.632 --> 55:34.799
He's got Anna.

55:34.800 --> 55:36.207
He'll kill you.

55:38.303 --> 55:39.591
No, he won't.

55:40.097 --> 55:42.049
I'm gonna give him
exactly what he wants.

55:53.777 --> 55:57.405
Hi. I bet your name's Anna.

55:57.406 --> 55:58.573
And who are you?

55:58.574 --> 56:00.408
I'm the new guy,

56:00.409 --> 56:03.287
and I'm having a
really bad first day.

56:05.706 --> 56:07.373
What are you doing?

56:08.167 --> 56:10.585
Give me your cell phone.

56:10.586 --> 56:12.288
Please.

56:18.969 --> 56:20.340
Thank you.

56:27.811 --> 56:29.051
Let her go.

56:29.772 --> 56:31.647
Oh, hello.

56:31.648 --> 56:33.107
Let her go and I'll
give you what you want.

56:33.108 --> 56:34.692
Tom!

56:34.693 --> 56:36.778
Anna, baby, it's okay.
Everything is gonna be okay.

56:36.779 --> 56:38.980
Just a friendly exchange.

56:39.323 --> 56:42.105
Something you want for
something I want.

56:42.117 --> 56:43.659
Aw, cute.

56:43.660 --> 56:45.161
You've really thought this
through, haven't you?

56:45.162 --> 56:47.622
Now, I don't like the way this is
going, all I gotta do is make a cut

56:47.623 --> 56:49.041
and it's game over, you lose.

56:49.416 --> 56:51.249
We both lose.

56:51.502 --> 56:54.045
Except, one of us will be able
to live with the outcome,

56:54.046 --> 56:55.630
and one of us will not.

56:55.923 --> 56:57.507
I don't believe that's true.

56:57.508 --> 56:58.841
Emmerich, what are
you doing? Emmerich.

56:58.842 --> 57:00.510
- I'm taking a risk...
- Emmerich, I've got this.

57:00.511 --> 57:02.297
as an act of good faith.

57:03.722 --> 57:06.182
You've been trying to
get into our file room.

57:06.183 --> 57:09.310
I think you have a job to do,
and you intend to see it through.

57:09.311 --> 57:10.551
Am I right?

57:12.189 --> 57:14.774
But I am confident that if you
were to put your gun down

57:14.775 --> 57:17.474
then Tom would throw out that card.

57:17.694 --> 57:19.695
Then both parties

57:19.696 --> 57:23.654
would be confident in the good
faith of these negotiations.

57:32.251 --> 57:34.084
Your turn.

57:44.263 --> 57:45.669
Now, let her go.

57:46.974 --> 57:51.727
That's not gonna work for me,
I want him to bring it to me.

57:51.729 --> 57:56.399
- For God's sake, let's just get this done...
- No, Emmerich!

57:56.400 --> 57:57.853
Emmerich, what are you doing?

58:00.446 --> 58:02.196
Now, let her go.

58:04.825 --> 58:07.410
Sorry, I'm renegotiating.

58:07.411 --> 58:09.030
No!

58:14.376 --> 58:15.865
Get up.

58:26.430 --> 58:28.298
After you.

58:34.063 --> 58:35.849
You shot me!

58:39.193 --> 58:41.145
You might just live.

58:41.904 --> 58:43.986
You're supposed to be the boss!

58:44.364 --> 58:47.491
How hard is it to clear
out your own office?

58:47.743 --> 58:49.909
Just get this done so I
can go to the hospital.

58:58.295 --> 58:59.702
Come on.

59:15.312 --> 59:16.719
Let him go, or I shoot.

59:16.814 --> 59:18.101
You won't do that.

59:18.857 --> 59:21.105
Yeah? Try me.

59:29.493 --> 59:30.733
Anna, now!

01:00:39.688 --> 01:00:41.481
What are you doing?
You can't go in there!

01:00:41.482 --> 01:00:43.517
Go get that fire extinguisher.

01:00:53.994 --> 01:00:55.995
- Oh, shit.
- Tom.

01:00:55.996 --> 01:00:58.696
Yeah, give that to me. Stay back.

01:01:36.662 --> 01:01:38.578
Tom!

01:01:48.882 --> 01:01:50.174
Get off him!

01:01:51.635 --> 01:01:53.042
Hey!

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.722
You got no clue who you're...

01:02:11.864 --> 01:02:13.946
11-22.

01:02:41.143 --> 01:02:42.393
Tom.

01:02:42.394 --> 01:02:43.853
- You okay?
- Yeah, are you okay?

01:02:43.854 --> 01:02:45.142
Yeah.

01:02:47.524 --> 01:02:50.105
- I'll get the elevator started.
- Yeah.

01:02:51.695 --> 01:02:54.573
I guess Harcourt's not
going to trial today, huh?

01:03:03.457 --> 01:03:04.910
Holy shit.

01:03:58.554 --> 01:04:00.969
This has nothing to
do with Gambizzi.

01:04:03.767 --> 01:04:06.727
This is why he broke in the office.

01:04:06.729 --> 01:04:08.396
Denning hired him

01:04:08.439 --> 01:04:10.106
to destroy the Harcourt file.

01:04:10.107 --> 01:04:11.941
- Tom...
- This is proof!

01:04:11.942 --> 01:04:14.902
Denning knew that Prophidil could harm
people, and they released it anyway.

01:04:14.903 --> 01:04:17.354
Tom, I need you to
call me an ambulance.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.480
Okay.

01:04:27.833 --> 01:04:31.457
11-22.

01:05:05.746 --> 01:05:07.455
We have a situation.

01:05:07.456 --> 01:05:10.708
Nobody was supposed to be up here.

01:05:10.709 --> 01:05:13.243
Three, and the one we talked about.

01:05:14.463 --> 01:05:15.751
It was you.

01:05:17.841 --> 01:05:20.089
What, you were throwing
the case for Denning?

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:24.051
- The money was just a way out.
- A way out of what?

01:05:24.723 --> 01:05:26.889
Think of this more as a settlement.

01:05:27.393 --> 01:05:28.893
Oh, don't be so naive.

01:05:28.894 --> 01:05:32.396
Every lawyer has a price, even you.

01:05:32.398 --> 01:05:33.856
I'm not a lawyer.

01:05:33.857 --> 01:05:35.066
You can be.

01:05:35.067 --> 01:05:39.278
You can go wherever you want at
RBE, Tom. I will make sure of that.

01:05:39.279 --> 01:05:41.813
Well, I want a raise. A big one!

01:05:43.575 --> 01:05:44.815
And a corner office.

01:05:46.161 --> 01:05:47.912
And then, I want to watch

01:05:47.913 --> 01:05:52.618
when you tell Roger's wife and kids
that you had him murdered for money.

01:05:53.669 --> 01:05:54.909
You fuck.

01:05:55.838 --> 01:05:59.382
It was supposed to be an electrical fire!
No one was supposed to get hurt!

01:05:59.383 --> 01:06:01.050
Then why did he have a gun?

01:06:01.427 --> 01:06:04.262
Why did he call you and say "Three,
and the one we talked about"?

01:06:04.263 --> 01:06:07.674
"The one we talked about"?
That was Roger, wasn't it?

01:06:08.726 --> 01:06:11.894
Roger found this, brought this
to you and you had him killed.

01:06:11.895 --> 01:06:14.180
No, I am not a killer.

01:06:14.273 --> 01:06:16.438
No, you just pay other
people to do it for you.

01:06:17.568 --> 01:06:18.974
It's easier.

01:06:19.987 --> 01:06:21.820
Shred that file.

01:06:22.573 --> 01:06:25.106
You think the Mafia is scary?

01:06:26.285 --> 01:06:29.447
Wait till you see what a multi-billion
dollar corporation will do.

01:06:29.705 --> 01:06:33.749
Denning has people
everywhere, in every firm,

01:06:33.751 --> 01:06:36.995
every police precinct,
every governmental agency.

01:06:37.546 --> 01:06:41.007
If you don't shred that file,
they will come for you.

01:06:41.008 --> 01:06:42.248
Why would they?

01:06:42.634 --> 01:06:44.171
You fired me.

01:06:44.636 --> 01:06:45.924
Remember?

01:06:47.765 --> 01:06:49.598
I clocked out at 9:00.

01:06:51.351 --> 01:06:54.229
Thanks to you, I couldn't
even swipe back up again.

01:06:56.023 --> 01:06:57.311
Go.

01:08:11.515 --> 01:08:14.890
Reported gunshots
fired, 34th floor.

01:08:18.647 --> 01:08:20.022
- Hey.
- Tom!

01:08:20.023 --> 01:08:21.858
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

01:08:21.859 --> 01:08:23.229
Hi.

01:08:23.986 --> 01:08:27.029
- Okay. We've gotta get out of here.
- Okay.

01:08:33.245 --> 01:08:34.533
Hey, where's Emmerich?

01:08:39.292 --> 01:08:41.544
Check the perimeter offices,
if you find anyone, detain them.

01:08:41.545 --> 01:08:43.377
I'll get some backup.

01:08:51.388 --> 01:08:53.720
What did you do with the file?

01:08:54.515 --> 01:08:56.058
What I do best.

01:09:22.586 --> 01:09:23.795
Morning, sir.

01:09:23.796 --> 01:09:25.381
Morning, how are you doing today?

01:09:36.433 --> 01:09:38.602
I'm gonna call in sick,
give me your cell phone.

01:10:22.479 --> 01:10:24.063
If anybody asks,

01:10:24.481 --> 01:10:25.982
- we were never here.
- Okay.

01:10:28.819 --> 01:10:30.190
Yeah?

01:10:31.989 --> 01:10:33.941
What does he look like?

01:10:38.495 --> 01:10:39.955
Got him.

01:10:40.305 --> 01:10:46.431
