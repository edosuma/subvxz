WEBVTT

02:00.468 --> 02:04.762
- Do you see anything?
- Negative, sir. Pull up on the port side.

02:15.026 --> 02:17.102
Looks deserted.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.958
Throw the line.

02:36.008 --> 02:38.084
Heading back.

02:53.402 --> 02:56.522
'l was late for my appointment
with a prospective client

02:56.572 --> 02:58.861
'but I had a terrific excuse.

02:58.908 --> 03:03.405
'In fact, I had it with me,
all 60 pounds and two horns of it.'

03:14.050 --> 03:16.506
- Thomas Magnum?
- Marion Hammond?

03:17.345 --> 03:19.837
The private investigator?

03:21.433 --> 03:24.007
You're probably wondering about the goat.

03:24.061 --> 03:26.387
Let me drop off my friend and then we'll talk.

03:28.566 --> 03:30.642
Here we go.

03:30.693 --> 03:33.149
Oh, boy.

03:41.289 --> 03:45.951
I'll be right with you.
Come on, Horace. Here we go.

03:46.002 --> 03:50.665
Argh ! Don't eat Higgins' flowers, Horace.
I'll be right back.

03:52.217 --> 03:54.709
See, I'm taking care of Horace for a friend.

03:54.762 --> 03:57.799
OK, Horace, you're on your own.

03:57.849 --> 04:01.135
She's nine years old
and her grandmother's visiting

04:01.186 --> 04:03.475
and she's allergic to goats.

04:03.522 --> 04:08.268
By the way, have you seen Higgins? He's a
little man. He's English and hates surprises.

04:08.319 --> 04:11.605
- No.
- He's probably still at the vet's.

04:12.573 --> 04:15.325
See, his dogs have been
off their feed lately...

04:15.368 --> 04:18.903
Listen, are you sure
you're Thomas Magnum?

04:18.954 --> 04:20.414
Oh, yeah.

04:20.457 --> 04:22.117
Oh...

04:23.127 --> 04:27.421
I'm sorry about all the distractions.
What have you heard about your father?

04:27.465 --> 04:32.507
- Was the Coast Guard any help?
- They know he was in the Nihoa Channel.

04:32.554 --> 04:35.639
When they found his boat
there was no sign of him.

04:35.682 --> 04:40.725
Nobody else was in the channel.
At least nobody came forward.

04:40.771 --> 04:45.434
The locals believe that the channel's
cursed to anybody but themselves.

04:45.485 --> 04:48.155
- It's sacred water.
- I know all about that.

04:48.196 --> 04:50.522
- Why'd he go out there?
- I don't know.

04:50.574 --> 04:55.201
- It wasn't like my father to go diving alone.
- He went diving?

04:55.246 --> 04:57.951
Yeah, they found his scuba gear
laid out on deck.

04:57.999 --> 05:00.669
- Then he never made his dive?
- No.

05:01.962 --> 05:03.836
The waters were calm that day.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.716
My father was an experienced seaman.

05:06.759 --> 05:09.167
You know, he didn't get washed overboard.

05:09.220 --> 05:12.636
l have a feeling that this wasn't an accident.

05:12.682 --> 05:16.347
I told you on the telephone,
I want you to find my father. Will you?

05:17.896 --> 05:21.515
I have $2,000 in scholarship money.
You can have it all.

05:22.109 --> 05:23.901
- Scholarship money?
- Yeah.

05:23.944 --> 05:29.022
I was getting my doctorate in Marine
Biology at the University of San Diego.

05:29.075 --> 05:30.618
Till this happened.

05:30.660 --> 05:34.361
- I don't want your scholarship money.
- But it's all I have.

05:35.624 --> 05:37.997
Well, we'll talk about money later.

05:39.211 --> 05:42.960
'Marion was staying on her father's boat
and wanted to buy groceries.

05:43.007 --> 05:47.753
'I went right to work but I couldn't get
the time of day from the locals at the dock.

05:47.804 --> 05:52.301
'They weren't about to discuss the Nihoa
Channel with any haole investigator.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.842
'I decided to seek comfort from a friend.'

06:09.829 --> 06:11.905
Hey, Rick !

06:13.333 --> 06:15.539
- Hi, Thomas !
- How are you doing?

06:17.004 --> 06:18.878
What are you doing down here?

06:18.922 --> 06:22.967
- I'm on a case and I'm getting nowhere.
- I wish I could help

06:23.010 --> 06:27.008
but I'm expecting a couple of club members
any minute now.

06:27.056 --> 06:28.930
- Can I have a cold beer?
- Yeah.

06:28.975 --> 06:34.017
No. The freezer's not freezing. I'm waiting
for the guy to come here and fix it.

06:34.064 --> 06:35.724
A little warm wouldn't hurt.

06:35.774 --> 06:39.108
Thomas, you can't drink warm beer.
You'll get heartburn.

06:39.153 --> 06:42.273
- Rick, I don't get heartburn !
- Maybe it was TC.

06:46.328 --> 06:50.373
That's your freezer repair man?
He does well for himself.

06:59.009 --> 07:00.883
Must be a union crew.

07:07.310 --> 07:10.311
- Hey, Rick, how's it going, buddy?
- Fine.

07:12.232 --> 07:15.482
- Well, see you later, Thomas.
- Rick.

07:15.527 --> 07:17.105
- What?
- That guy has a gun.

07:17.154 --> 07:19.906
- A gun?
- You know, bang bang, kills people.

07:19.949 --> 07:22.784
- That's how he fishes.
-  He shoots 'em?

07:22.827 --> 07:26.030
- Don't you remember, like we did in Nam?
- No.

07:26.080 --> 07:29.201
See you later, Thomas.
Cast off for me, will you?

07:44.267 --> 07:46.344
OK, Thomas, let her go.

07:48.647 --> 07:50.521
Thanks.

07:54.654 --> 07:57.739
- Hope you land a big one, Rick.
- Bye, Thomas.

08:07.335 --> 08:11.084
You want to know what happened
to Captain Hammond?

08:12.247 --> 08:14.425
That's right.

08:14.426 --> 08:17.213
It's taboo for my people
to talk of the channel.

08:17.262 --> 08:21.130
The Nihoa waters are sacred.
They belong to Ta'aroa.

08:22.351 --> 08:24.807
- Ta'aroa?
- God of the sea.

08:24.854 --> 08:28.354
No haole may enter the channel.
All who do, die.

08:31.361 --> 08:35.857
Well, the Navy's been going out
in that channel for quite a few years.

08:35.908 --> 08:38.067
Nothing seems to have happened to them.

08:38.119 --> 08:42.828
Everything is done in Ta'aroa's time.
You have been warned.

08:51.092 --> 08:53.761
'Charming little club,
made you wanna laugh.

08:53.803 --> 08:57.848
'Till you remembered people
disappeared in that channel.'

09:04.690 --> 09:06.600
Magnum.

09:11.531 --> 09:13.405
- Hi.
- How you doing?

09:13.450 --> 09:15.324
- Good.
- What did you find out?

09:15.369 --> 09:18.655
Ta'aroa doesn't want
any haoles swimming in his pool.

09:18.706 --> 09:21.375
- ls this your father's boat?
- Yeah.

09:23.211 --> 09:27.624
- Has your father always lived on a boat?
- Yes. He loved the sea.

09:29.885 --> 09:34.761
Our love of the ocean was the only thing
my father and I had in common.

09:36.225 --> 09:39.096
There wasn't a lot of contact between us.

09:41.398 --> 09:44.933
You know, I don't even know
why I care about what happened to him.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.894
He never cared much about me.

09:46.946 --> 09:49.615
I used to do everything
to make him proud of me.

09:49.657 --> 09:54.236
I learned how to sail, I learned how to dive,
I learned how to fish. It didn't matter.

09:54.287 --> 09:58.155
Even when I was a kid, no matter what I did,
it would never be enough.

10:10.013 --> 10:12.089
You better let me check this out.

10:53.518 --> 10:56.092
Obviously ceremonial.

10:58.482 --> 11:00.558
Very interesting.

11:05.073 --> 11:09.201
I think I know what this is.
I just want to make sure.

11:15.126 --> 11:18.460
Keone, could you come here
a moment, please?

11:18.504 --> 11:21.790
Keone is my assistant.
He's an expert on island cults.

11:21.841 --> 11:24.084
This is Nat Hammond's daughter, Marion.

11:24.136 --> 11:27.635
- How do you do?
- And Mr Thomas Magnum.

11:27.681 --> 11:30.054
Could you tell us what this is?

11:31.060 --> 11:34.227
This is Tupuna, the knife of Nihoa.

11:34.272 --> 11:38.104
It brings with it Ta'aroa's curse.
Haoles should not possess it.

11:40.028 --> 11:42.105
Keone.

11:42.156 --> 11:44.232
Thank you.

11:47.829 --> 11:53.286
Keone's a bit blunt at times
but his knowledge is indisputable.

11:53.335 --> 11:57.285
Nat Hammond must've done something
to anger the Nihoa cult people.

11:57.339 --> 12:00.875
Are they responsible
for my father's disappearance?

12:00.927 --> 12:03.003
No, of course not.

12:04.639 --> 12:06.549
I didn't mean to imply that at all.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.051
Have you any idea why Captain Hammond
was in the Nihoa Channel

12:10.104 --> 12:11.562
the day he disappeared?

12:13.190 --> 12:14.685
None whatsoever.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.317
Did he ever talk with you about
what kind of research he was doing?

12:18.363 --> 12:20.356
Your father was a very secretive man.

12:20.407 --> 12:26.944
He liked to be sure of himself before making
others aware of his so-called discoveries.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.667
So-called discoveries?

12:29.709 --> 12:33.577
Excuse me, but my father
has been credited with genuine finds.

12:33.630 --> 12:35.124
A few.

12:35.173 --> 12:39.005
Professor, maybe my father never
sat behind a desk or taught school

12:39.052 --> 12:42.837
but he gave his life to the sea
and researching these islands.

12:42.890 --> 12:45.512
And his groundless
theory on Kulturkreise...

12:45.560 --> 12:50.222
Hold it. Please. What is Kulturkreise?

12:50.273 --> 12:54.568
Culture circles. The belief
that an invention starts in one place

12:54.611 --> 12:58.562
and spreads outward to other countries
in ever-widening circles.

12:58.616 --> 13:01.653
Like ripples when you drop a stone
into a pond.

13:01.703 --> 13:07.160
For example... Let me show you
evidence I use in my new book.

13:07.209 --> 13:12.714
This Hawaiian costume, I believe,
was influenced by Spanish conquistadors.

13:12.757 --> 13:14.833
Can you see the similarities?

13:14.884 --> 13:18.799
There is a resemblance but I thought
the Spanish came here much later.

13:18.847 --> 13:21.848
Well, although,
there's no direct documentation,

13:21.892 --> 13:24.465
their trade routes went by these islands.

13:24.520 --> 13:28.221
So it's more than likely
that at least one ship stopped here.

13:28.274 --> 13:30.183
I guess that makes sense.

13:30.234 --> 13:34.564
Except that it makes the Hawaiians
very unimaginative people.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.737
Contrary to the theory in your book,

13:36.783 --> 13:40.200
my father believed in the theory
of simultaneous evolution.

13:40.246 --> 13:42.701
In other words, that all around the world,

13:42.748 --> 13:46.829
in different civilisations,
people came up with their own inventions.

13:46.878 --> 13:49.915
Some of which happen to be
very similar to one another.

13:49.965 --> 13:54.129
Unfortunately, he based that
on the flimsiest of evidence.

13:55.554 --> 13:58.390
- Excuse me, I have a class now.
- Sure.

14:01.019 --> 14:04.020
It was very nice to meet you both.

14:04.064 --> 14:09.770
And if I can be of any further assistance,
or Keone can, please don't hesitate to ask.

14:09.820 --> 14:12.276
- Thank you.
- Bye-bye.

14:17.328 --> 14:19.286
You don't like her very much, do you?

14:24.211 --> 14:26.287
How'd you guess?

14:28.299 --> 14:31.336
'There were people
I'd rather question than Tehani.

14:31.386 --> 14:34.969
'But who knows? Maybe under that muumuu
there was a heart of gold.'

14:37.935 --> 14:42.147
What are you, the Priestess who ordered
the ransacking of Hammond's boat?

14:42.189 --> 14:45.808
I have no interest in Captain Hammond
or his boat.

14:45.860 --> 14:48.482
He was simply another haole
seeking riches.

14:52.075 --> 14:54.152
What riches?

15:35.999 --> 15:37.458
Thank you !

15:39.170 --> 15:41.922
Hey ! You're off your diet. That's great.

15:41.964 --> 15:46.710
Admiral Jenkins lift the rule about staying
within 10 pounds of your enlistment weight?

15:46.761 --> 15:50.380
You don't understand.
I was practically engaged. Me and Ruth.

15:50.432 --> 15:52.721
She left me for a tuna boat captain.

15:52.768 --> 15:55.888
So that's the reason
for the two scoops of chocolate

15:55.938 --> 15:58.975
and butterscotch, nuts, that's great.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.860
- There's banana in there.
- There were cherries.

16:01.903 --> 16:03.943
What do you want from me?

16:03.989 --> 16:06.527
- Me, want?
- Yeah, want.

16:06.575 --> 16:10.194
Now you mention it,
I do have a client with a missing father

16:10.246 --> 16:13.117
- who was last seen in the Nihoa Channel.
- So?

16:13.166 --> 16:16.001
- He was diving for treasure.
- In the Nihoa Channel?

16:16.044 --> 16:19.081
- That's where you come in.
- No, that's where I leave.

16:19.131 --> 16:22.880
Mac, I just figured that you could use
those computers of yours

16:22.927 --> 16:27.922
to put together a list of ships that went down
in that channel in the last 200 years.

16:27.974 --> 16:31.094
Magnum, what do you think
those computers are? My toys?

16:31.144 --> 16:35.356
The Navy's not gonna care if you use them
for extracurricular activity.

16:35.399 --> 16:38.151
- The hell they're not. Nol
- Mac !

16:38.194 --> 16:42.523
Did I tell you that next Tuesday
I'm having lunch with Admiral Jenkins?

16:42.573 --> 16:45.528
We're gonna talk about
a physical fitness programme.

16:45.577 --> 16:48.246
It'll just be great to see old iron pants.

16:48.288 --> 16:50.661
No, you didn't tell me that.

16:51.542 --> 16:55.291
'Mac seems
to be wedded to the book of regulations

16:55.338 --> 16:57.627
'but his heart's in the right place.

16:57.674 --> 17:01.541
'With just a little encouragement,
Mac obliged me with the computers

17:01.595 --> 17:06.056
'and they scrolled out a list of ships
as long as the Honolulu phone directory.

17:06.099 --> 17:10.679
'The Nihoa Channel was one dangerous
place and had been for a long time.

17:10.730 --> 17:14.182
'I decided to consult an expert
to check the list out.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.603
'I only hoped he hadn't
discovered my house guest.'

17:51.108 --> 17:54.857
- Ah ! Just the man I wanted to see.
- I want to speak to you...

17:54.904 --> 17:57.941
Before you start,
there's something I want to explain.

17:57.991 --> 18:01.443
Please, hear me out.
Ever since I came back from the kennels,

18:01.495 --> 18:04.412
I've been disturbed
by some most peculiar sounds.

18:04.456 --> 18:06.948
I can't locate the source. It's very puzzling.

18:07.001 --> 18:09.457
- Sounds?
- Emanating from the grounds.

18:09.504 --> 18:12.339
- Yet, it just isn't possible.
- Why not?

18:12.382 --> 18:16.083
Because I know what's making the sounds.
It's an animal.

18:16.136 --> 18:18.425
- Really?
- Yes.

18:18.472 --> 18:23.977
I last heard those sounds
on the Zambezi in the African plain.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.970
It's the unmistakable cry of the kudu buck
calling to its doe.

18:30.736 --> 18:33.903
There it is again !
You did hear it, didn't you?

18:33.947 --> 18:35.276
Hear what?

18:36.450 --> 18:37.695
Oh, Higgins,

18:37.743 --> 18:41.694
there's something I want you to look at.
What do you make of that?

18:43.458 --> 18:45.367
What is it?

18:46.962 --> 18:50.296
It's a list of ships
that the computer produced

18:50.341 --> 18:53.627
that could have gone down
in the Nihoa Channel.

18:54.846 --> 18:56.637
Strange.

18:56.681 --> 18:58.757
No native vessels.

19:00.102 --> 19:03.388
You know, I never noticed that. You're right.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.013
- Maybe no one reported them.
- Perhaps.

19:07.068 --> 19:10.519
- There is supposed to be a curse.
- Yes, I know all about it.

19:10.572 --> 19:12.861
- A group of Hawaiians...
- It's sacred.

19:12.907 --> 19:15.114
- No haoles...
- Should ever go there.

19:15.160 --> 19:17.532
lf you know so much,
why are you asking me?

19:18.038 --> 19:20.327
I'm sorry, Higgins.

19:27.674 --> 19:30.461
- That's interesting.
- What?

19:31.428 --> 19:33.220
What?

19:33.263 --> 19:36.218
The Eldora. A Spanish galleon.

19:36.267 --> 19:40.645
Used to carry the plunder back
from Spain's numerous conquests.

19:40.688 --> 19:44.140
- But what was she doing here?
- I don't know and I don't care !

19:44.192 --> 19:47.194
Are you saying
there could be a treasure ship there?

19:47.237 --> 19:49.989
No. I'm interpreting
the data from the computer.

19:50.032 --> 19:53.283
! ti wenk I -
.wonk t'nod uoy gnihton s'ereht smees tI -

19:53.327 --> 19:56.495
Hammond knew about it
but they killed him before he got to it.

20:00.002 --> 20:04.747
Well, it's been a long day.
I think I'll turn in early.

20:04.799 --> 20:08.168
Sure you won't join me
in a brandy and soda?

20:08.219 --> 20:10.259
No. I had a whiskey after lunch.

20:10.305 --> 20:13.674
I think that perhaps is sufficient for today.

20:18.272 --> 20:20.348
Bye.

20:42.299 --> 20:45.086
'I wanted to take a look
at that channel myself.

20:45.135 --> 20:48.587
'Rick, being a friend,
would loan me the King Kamehameha l.

20:48.639 --> 20:53.515
'At first Rick wasn't crazy about the idea
but I appealed to his better nature.

20:53.561 --> 20:58.224
'Of course, it didn't hurt to drop
a couple of hints about a sunken treasure.'

21:05.283 --> 21:07.157
I see you have diving gear.

21:07.201 --> 21:10.785
- You refuse to listen.
- I listen.

21:10.830 --> 21:13.785
Maybe sometimes
I just don't take good advice.

21:13.834 --> 21:15.957
That's the trouble with you haoles.

21:30.853 --> 21:33.142
- Hi, Rick.
- Hello, Thomas.

21:37.902 --> 21:40.654
- I see you've met.
- Yeah, we sure have.

21:44.868 --> 21:47.704
- Hello, Thomas.
- Hi, Marion.

21:54.587 --> 21:58.965
Marion said you'd give me the skinny
on the treasure. What's the payoff?

21:59.510 --> 22:01.835
Hard to tell with treasure.

22:01.887 --> 22:05.636
- Should I cast off?
- Yes, you may untie the bow.

22:06.643 --> 22:07.888
ls that the front?

22:10.480 --> 22:11.575
Here.

22:26.957 --> 22:29.282
- Look out, Thomas !
- Thomas !

22:48.981 --> 22:51.769
- I gotta find him.
- Did you see him?

23:06.417 --> 23:08.291
You all right?

23:14.009 --> 23:16.085
Where's that guy?

23:16.137 --> 23:18.295
He hasn't come up yet.

24:16.537 --> 24:21.365
Thank you. That could have been me
if you hadn't known how to dive.

24:21.418 --> 24:24.419
Thank my father, he taught me.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.790
He would've been very proud of you.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.544
He's dead, isn't he?

24:32.054 --> 24:34.178
I think so.

24:44.568 --> 24:48.353
Do you think that man, Keone, killed him?

24:48.906 --> 24:53.699
Well, it would make sense. He sure didn't
want us to go out in that channel.

24:54.788 --> 24:59.616
Well, I took care of it for the time being,
with the usual promises of not leaving town.

24:59.668 --> 25:02.338
Sorry you had to go through this, honey.

25:02.380 --> 25:05.215
Does that mean we're not
going out into the channel?

25:05.258 --> 25:09.042
I wouldn't advise it.
Not until the police leave the dock.

25:10.681 --> 25:15.260
Marion, if there's treasure out there,
it'll still be there in 24 hours.

25:15.311 --> 25:19.558
- It's not the treasure I was thinking about.
- I know.

25:21.526 --> 25:23.649
I'm gonna go down below and change.

25:46.053 --> 25:50.134
Hi, Higgins. What are you doing?
Cleaning the old rifles again?

25:50.183 --> 25:52.757
- I'm going hunting.
- Hunting what?

25:52.811 --> 25:55.978
The kudu buck that is roaming freely
on this estate.

25:56.023 --> 25:58.858
And don't tell me
it's a figment of my imagination.

25:58.901 --> 26:03.195
Figments don't eat rare tropical flowers.
Mine have been decimated.

26:03.239 --> 26:06.858
Higgins, now you just listen to me.

26:08.662 --> 26:11.449
Before you shoot anything,
you ought to know this.

26:11.498 --> 26:13.242
You can't tell me about kudus.

26:13.292 --> 26:17.077
- I've studied them at close range.
- Then you know what they look like.

26:17.130 --> 26:18.957
- Little horns.
- Great antlers.

26:19.007 --> 26:21.676
- This tall. Little chin whiskers.
- Much larger.

26:22.469 --> 26:25.007
Don't be ridiculous. That's a goat.

26:25.973 --> 26:31.050
I'm talking about a type of antelope
found only in the...

26:36.485 --> 26:40.068
Magnum, are you telling me
the animal in question is...

26:40.114 --> 26:43.898
- A goat.
- A wild goat?

26:44.785 --> 26:46.862
Tame, a child's pet, called Horace.

26:46.913 --> 26:49.238
You can't shoot it when you know its name.

26:49.290 --> 26:54.333
How did a goat get on Robin Masters'
estate? l...withdraw the question.

26:54.755 --> 26:56.629
Remove the creature immediately.

26:56.674 --> 26:58.963
Come on, Higgins, just another day.

26:59.010 --> 27:02.545
- One more. And I'll...
- You'll what?

27:03.348 --> 27:07.216
- I'll give up the tennis courts.
- You don't have the tennis courts.

27:07.269 --> 27:08.364
Oh.

27:10.147 --> 27:12.473
How about a share in the buried treasure?

27:12.525 --> 27:16.439
The treasure? You don't know where it is.
The Eldora could be anywhere.

27:16.487 --> 27:20.236
You could say that.
But certain clues tell me that I'm warm.

27:23.245 --> 27:26.495
- Very warm.
- You're sure?

27:28.751 --> 27:30.827
You're absolutely positive?

27:30.878 --> 27:33.630
I'm about as positive as a person can be.

27:35.217 --> 27:37.459
I wouldn't want the treasure for myself.

27:37.511 --> 27:42.007
I'm only thinking of the contribution
I could make to The British Museum.

27:42.058 --> 27:44.134
Naturally.

27:45.019 --> 27:47.308
I'll give you and the goat 24 hours.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.999
I just can't believe it.

28:15.553 --> 28:20.216
He was such a good student
and excellent assistant.

28:21.560 --> 28:23.636
He worked so hard.

28:25.815 --> 28:27.891
May I borrow this?

28:27.942 --> 28:29.851
Thank you.

28:32.238 --> 28:35.939
Did Keone ever mention the Eldora?

28:35.993 --> 28:38.448
No. Why?

28:38.495 --> 28:40.987
I think it's at the bottom
of the Nihoa Channel.

28:41.832 --> 28:43.909
- What?
- Yeah.

28:45.753 --> 28:49.039
Well, that would make sense then.

28:49.091 --> 28:53.136
Considering the Spanish influence
I believe occurred on these islands.

28:54.388 --> 28:57.592
- Do you think Hammond discovered her?
- Yeah.

29:00.228 --> 29:02.055
That would be just like him.

29:02.105 --> 29:05.889
To discover something supporting
my theories and then not reveal it.

29:06.902 --> 29:08.444
ls that why Keone killed him?

29:09.363 --> 29:11.736
Do you really think Keone killed Hammond?

29:12.658 --> 29:17.155
Keone died trying to keep me out of
that channel. Why not Hammond?

29:18.623 --> 29:22.918
I have to believe what Keone did to you
was just an act of religious fervour.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.835
He only intended to frighten you.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.835
You've seen the depth of feeling
these people have.

29:27.884 --> 29:30.173
One must respect that.

29:32.430 --> 29:34.554
Well, you're probably right.

29:45.111 --> 29:49.939
Maybe Keone wasn't interested in merely
preserving the sanctity of the channel.

30:09.555 --> 30:11.429
You better be right, sweetheart.

30:11.474 --> 30:15.424
- When have I ever been wrong?
- I can't count that high.

30:24.488 --> 30:27.774
I think we're just about over it.
Can you cut your engines?

30:27.825 --> 30:29.652
OK.

30:38.087 --> 30:40.958
- Sure you don't wanna go diving with me?
- No, no.

30:41.007 --> 30:44.008
I'll stay right here.
There could be emergencies.

31:04.533 --> 31:06.609
Turn it on, will you?

31:10.331 --> 31:12.407
OK. Tank's on.

31:20.634 --> 31:22.710
All set?

32:41.975 --> 32:44.810
'Thinking about Hammond, Keone
and the Nihoa cult,

32:44.853 --> 32:47.261
'I began to wonder
what I was doing by myself

32:47.314 --> 32:49.390
'at the bottom of a dangerous channel.

32:49.441 --> 32:53.653
'I consoled myself with the knowledge
that firearms didn't work underwater.

32:53.696 --> 32:58.406
'lf anyone tried to hurt me, they'd have
to get close enough to use a spear gun.

32:58.451 --> 33:01.073
'And, so far, I seemed to be alone.

34:19.833 --> 34:25.754
'It didn't exactly look like a Spanish galleon.
In fact, it looked more like a large tablet.

34:25.799 --> 34:29.215
'And its few engravings
hardly made for treasure.

34:29.261 --> 34:32.344
'My first question was -
what did Hammond want with it?

34:33.474 --> 34:37.223
'My second - what was I going to tell
Rick and Higgins?

34:37.270 --> 34:41.849
'Congratulations, guys,
you're part owners of a piece of the rock'?'

34:49.652 --> 34:51.527
I got one.

34:57.412 --> 34:59.286
I got it.

35:01.750 --> 35:03.624
I got it.

35:06.756 --> 35:09.959
- Well, did you find it?
- You could say that.

35:10.510 --> 35:12.467
Great ! Where is it?

35:12.512 --> 35:15.383
Well, it's been down there quite a while...

35:16.308 --> 35:19.558
- Wait. There's nothing wrong, is there?
- No.

35:19.603 --> 35:23.553
There's nothing wrong.
It's just there's a lot of coral and things.

35:23.608 --> 35:26.064
It's going to be hard to get up, that's all.

35:26.110 --> 35:28.103
God, you scared me for a minute.

35:28.154 --> 35:31.072
There's people I'd like to talk to
before we do more.

35:31.116 --> 35:34.568
- Like who?
- Technical experts. That sort of thing.

35:34.620 --> 35:36.909
- Come on.
- So it takes a little longer.

35:36.956 --> 35:40.657
What difference does it make?
It's not gonna be the end of the world.

35:55.935 --> 36:00.183
'It's normal for people to behave strangely
when it comes to sunken treasure.

36:00.232 --> 36:03.150
'I left Rick feeling
pretty sure he'd get his share.

36:03.193 --> 36:05.945
'I just didn't tell him his share of what.'

36:18.085 --> 36:21.122
Hi. Come on in.

36:28.889 --> 36:30.965
You OK?

36:37.440 --> 36:41.604
I was just going through
some of my father's things.

36:41.653 --> 36:45.947
Trying to see if I could
find anything that would help.

36:45.991 --> 36:50.452
- Marion.
- I f... I found...

36:52.415 --> 36:54.871
- I found...
- Found what?

36:55.919 --> 36:57.579
Everything.

36:58.547 --> 37:02.497
Everything I'd ever written.
Every picture ever taken of me.

37:03.803 --> 37:07.254
Report cards, school certificates, everything.

37:10.477 --> 37:11.936
He kept it all.

37:12.771 --> 37:15.476
He must've loved you very much.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.944
Why, why didn't he tell me?

37:23.950 --> 37:27.651
I don't know.
Some fathers have a hard time doing that.

37:30.207 --> 37:31.701
Yeah.

37:34.295 --> 37:36.703
I guess I'm not as tough as I used to be.

37:36.756 --> 37:38.832
I don't know about that.

37:40.468 --> 37:45.345
See, l...I always tried to be like my father.

37:45.391 --> 37:48.842
I thought it was better
not to show your feelings.

37:48.894 --> 37:51.220
It meant you were strong.

37:55.318 --> 37:57.691
May I?

37:57.738 --> 37:59.814
Yeah.

38:02.493 --> 38:04.984
But he wasn't any stronger.

38:05.037 --> 38:06.829
He was just sadder, that's all.

38:07.916 --> 38:10.323
And I don't want to be like that.

38:10.377 --> 38:13.212
I don't think you have to worry about it.

38:17.426 --> 38:18.521
Thanks.

38:20.763 --> 38:27.431
Marion, remember when you told me
about your father's research?

38:27.479 --> 38:29.555
- Yeah.
- What was he trying to prove?

38:29.606 --> 38:33.770
That people in different parts of the world
could have the same idea.

38:33.819 --> 38:36.774
Like the Spanish
didn't influence Hawaiian dress?

38:36.823 --> 38:38.198
Yeah, right.

38:38.241 --> 38:41.527
What would it take
to prove something like that?

38:41.578 --> 38:44.330
Something predating the conquistadors.

38:44.373 --> 38:48.074
Something that would show things
they'd supposedly influenced.

38:48.127 --> 38:52.042
Like a stone tablet
with some costume warriors carved on it?

38:54.885 --> 38:57.127
- You found something like that?
- Yeah.

38:57.253 --> 38:59.430
Oh, boy.

38:59.431 --> 39:04.473
lf it proved your father's theory was right,
then Professor Martinez's theory is wrong.

39:06.230 --> 39:09.516
What if she knew
what your father had found?

39:16.116 --> 39:21.990
I've been thinking. We haven't decided how
we're going to divide the treasure.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.827
Treasure? Doesn't he know?

39:24.876 --> 39:29.420
- Know what?
- That Marion and I have already decided.

39:29.465 --> 39:32.881
Equal shares for everyone.
Isn't that right, Marion?

39:33.594 --> 39:35.634
Sure. Equal shares.

39:44.523 --> 39:46.397
Look.

39:57.996 --> 40:02.291
All right, Rick. I'm gonna pull up alongside.
Get ready to jump.

40:11.887 --> 40:13.963
OK, go !

40:14.014 --> 40:15.758
Nice going, Rick.

40:15.808 --> 40:18.809
Catch the rope. Marion, catch it.

40:52.307 --> 40:55.842
- What'd you find?
- Bunch of stuff for making bombs.

40:55.894 --> 40:59.560
- Detonators and wires.
- Marion, you're not going down.

41:03.277 --> 41:05.354
I'll strangle her.

41:36.022 --> 41:37.932
'Marion wasn't easy to catch.

41:37.983 --> 41:41.482
'She also wasn't cooperative
when I signalled her to go back up.

41:41.528 --> 41:46.191
'She was displaying the same stubbornness
that probably got her father killed.'

44:25.461 --> 44:29.755
- You killed my father !
- Hey ! Hey ! Wait a second. Hold on.

44:31.593 --> 44:34.879
- She killed my father.
- Just take it easy, wait a second.

44:34.930 --> 44:39.473
- Where's Thomas?
- He's still down there with the bomb.

44:45.191 --> 44:47.943
'This was a day
I wished I'd listened to my mother

44:47.986 --> 44:49.943
'and studied to be an orthodontist.

44:49.988 --> 44:54.734
'Looking into someone's mouth has gotta be
better than staring death in the face.'

45:14.891 --> 45:16.765
Hi, guys.

45:16.810 --> 45:19.479
Thomas !

45:37.833 --> 45:39.114
Still mad at me?

45:44.299 --> 45:45.959
Thank you.

45:49.221 --> 45:54.263
Tehani sure has been a lot friendlier
since she found out about the tablet.

45:54.310 --> 45:59.601
Yeah, she didn't mind our trespassing
so much, once I showed her what we found.

46:03.069 --> 46:06.355
- I'll send you your fee.
- I'll send it straight back to you.

46:06.407 --> 46:09.657
Your father would've wanted
you to finish your studies.

46:09.702 --> 46:12.988
- I'll tell you what I will want, though.
- What?

46:13.539 --> 46:16.825
I want a copy of your doctoral thesis
when you finish it.

46:16.877 --> 46:18.953
You got it.

46:21.882 --> 46:23.424
- Magnum.
- Hey.

46:23.467 --> 46:25.543
I'll see you again.

46:40.862 --> 46:42.356
Thanks.

46:44.157 --> 46:46.233
Airport.

47:21.198 --> 47:23.274
Rick, what's going on?

47:26.496 --> 47:28.287
Thomas, I'll tell you.

47:28.331 --> 47:33.243
I find it very difficult working out my
retirement on my share of the treasure.

47:34.338 --> 47:36.911
Rick, who are those guys, anyway?

47:36.966 --> 47:38.590
Those guys?

47:38.634 --> 47:42.679
Well, it was a convention.
Come on, cast me off, I gotta go.

48:15.008 --> 48:18.093
- Rick !
- Bye, Thomas !
