00:02.085 --> 00:03.921
(phone ringing)

00:03.963 --> 00:04.922
Hello.

00:04.964 --> 00:05.923
Dad, hi.

00:05.965 --> 00:07.048
Oh, Francis.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.843
How's the new job?

00:07.090 --> 00:08.843
Oh, it's good.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.511
I'm learning all kinds

00:08.884 --> 00:10.511
of new things.

00:10.552 --> 00:11.929
I got lots of responsibility.

00:11.971 --> 00:13.514
I'm actually making

00:11.971 --> 00:13.514
some good money.

00:13.555 --> 00:14.974
Hey, good for you.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.058
Dad, listen, I know I owe

00:15.015 --> 00:17.058
you guys a lot of money

00:17.100 --> 00:18.853
and I want to start

00:17.100 --> 00:18.853
paying you back.

00:18.894 --> 00:21.355
So I'm sending you $50 this

00:18.894 --> 00:21.355
month, and then my plan is...

00:21.396 --> 00:23.064
What do you need $50 for?

00:23.106 --> 00:25.233
No, I'm sending  you  $50.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.861
Francis, I can't spare $50.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.904
No, I'm sending  you  the money...

00:28.946 --> 00:31.448
Just give him the $50.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.448
We have to go.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.326
All right, your mother says

00:31.490 --> 00:34.326
it's okay, but we have to go.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.991
It's the first day of school.

01:14.033 --> 01:15.492
Everyone else is bummed,

01:15.534 --> 01:17.036
but I'm actually excited

01:15.534 --> 01:17.036
about it.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.829
I'm officially done

01:17.077 --> 01:18.829
with junior high.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.831
I'm not a Krelboyne anymore.

01:20.873 --> 01:23.124
I can be whatever I want to be.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.003
I don't have to worry about

01:23.166 --> 01:26.003
labels or cliques or who's cool.

01:26.045 --> 01:27.629
I'm going into high school.

01:27.671 --> 01:30.131
By the way,

01:27.671 --> 01:30.131
this is an excited twitch,

01:30.173 --> 01:31.842
not a nervous twitch.

01:31.884 --> 01:34.135
Can we please just

01:31.884 --> 01:34.135
eat our breakfast

01:34.177 --> 01:36.179
and stop all this complaining?

01:36.221 --> 01:37.765
But I don't understand.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.517
Why do we have to volunteer

01:37.806 --> 01:40.517
for the whole first week?

01:40.559 --> 01:42.143
Because we got caught, Hal.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.353
We ducked out

01:42.185 --> 01:43.353
for 12 years.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.313
They were bound

01:43.395 --> 01:45.313
to get us eventually.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.314
Dewey, come here.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.399
Listen, you're

01:46.356 --> 01:47.399
going to be

01:47.441 --> 01:48.358
coming home from school

01:48.400 --> 01:49.568
at 3:00 this year.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.653
So this is the key

01:49.610 --> 01:51.653
to the house.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.155
You will come straight home,

01:51.695 --> 01:54.155
you will let yourself in

01:54.197 --> 01:55.991
and you will be

01:54.197 --> 01:55.991
in this house alone

01:56.033 --> 01:57.158
until your

01:56.033 --> 01:57.158
brothers get here

01:57.200 --> 01:58.869
exactly 15 minutes

01:57.200 --> 01:58.869
later, and not

01:58.911 --> 02:00.537
one second more!

02:00.579 --> 02:03.248
We're giving this to you

02:00.579 --> 02:03.248
because we trust you.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.875
Congratulations.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.126
You're now a latchkey kid.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.089
Point four

02:07.502 --> 02:10.089
miles to go.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.465
Malcolm,

02:10.130 --> 02:11.465
if any big kids bother you,

02:11.506 --> 02:13.174
you go straight

02:11.506 --> 02:13.174
to your old teacher.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.176
I'm not going to Mr. Herkabe

02:13.216 --> 02:15.176
for anything.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.386
Point two.

02:16.428 --> 02:18.597
Why not? He's the new

02:16.428 --> 02:18.597
dean of discipline.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.766
Talk about having friends

02:18.639 --> 02:20.766
in high places.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.977
He's not a friend,

02:20.808 --> 02:22.977
he's a psychopath.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.812
He's been out to get me

02:23.018 --> 02:24.812
since the day we met.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.354
He actually told me that.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.232
What the heck is wrong

02:26.396 --> 02:29.232
with this stupid car?

02:29.274 --> 02:32.111
I've gone 30 miles since the

02:29.274 --> 02:32.111
gas light came on last night,

02:32.152 --> 02:33.194
and we're still going.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.989
Hal, look.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.989
There's the parking lot.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.448
You can

02:35.030 --> 02:36.448
let us out here.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.448
Yeah, Dad, here's good.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.784
Don't be silly. We're all

02:36.490 --> 02:38.784
going to the same place.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.619
Hal, look.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.619
A spot right up front.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.954
Right next to the cheerleaders.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.206
Thanks for what

02:43.622 --> 02:45.206
you did back there.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.708
The firecracker

02:45.248 --> 02:46.708
did all the work.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.127
That's the good thing

02:46.750 --> 02:48.127
about cheerleaders.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.210
They stampede easy.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.005
Let's get inside

02:49.252 --> 02:51.005
before Mom and Dad see...

02:51.046 --> 02:52.923
Ah, the golden boy

02:51.046 --> 02:52.923
has returned.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.133
Release the doves.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.134
Hi, Mr. Herkabe.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.217
And you must be Reese.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.511
I have been

02:57.552 --> 02:58.720
thoroughly briefed on you,

02:58.762 --> 03:00.221
and if you do one thing wrong,

03:00.263 --> 03:02.223
I'm going to go medieval

03:00.263 --> 03:02.223
on your permanent record.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.810
Ask yourself,

03:02.265 --> 03:04.810
whatever happened

03:04.852 --> 03:07.270
to the old dean

03:04.852 --> 03:07.270
of discipline?

03:08.313 --> 03:09.815
LOIS:

03:08.313 --> 03:09.815
Mr. Herkabe.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.232
Good morning.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.232
It is so exciting

03:11.274 --> 03:13.234
being here on the

03:11.274 --> 03:13.234
first day of school.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.820
Yes. It's like being

03:13.276 --> 03:14.820
at the cockfights

03:14.862 --> 03:16.488
before they open the cages.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.406
So the two hours a day-- does

03:16.530 --> 03:18.406
that include travel time?

03:18.448 --> 03:20.283
Because there was

03:18.448 --> 03:20.283
a lot of traffic.

03:20.325 --> 03:23.162
So, you'll be handing out

03:20.325 --> 03:23.162
health forms

03:23.202 --> 03:25.831
and you...

03:23.202 --> 03:25.831
report to the North Field.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.248
Can't we do something together?

03:27.290 --> 03:28.542
Let me check.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.169
Uh... no.

03:30.209 --> 03:31.170
But don't we both

03:31.210 --> 03:32.963
feel better

03:31.210 --> 03:32.963
knowing we tried?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.423
I am so sorry.

03:35.465 --> 03:37.258
I'll have your horse

03:35.465 --> 03:37.258
ready in two minutes.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.719
We're a little

03:37.300 --> 03:38.719
shorthanded today.

03:38.760 --> 03:39.970
I had to help

03:38.760 --> 03:39.970
make breakfast.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.262
You'll be riding

03:40.012 --> 03:41.262
Sparky here.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.098
I'll get him saddled

03:41.304 --> 03:43.098
right up for you.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.684
Would you like a

03:44.307 --> 03:45.684
croissant while you wait?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.644
Oh, sure.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.644
Good morning, Francis.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.479
What a beautiful day.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.898
Otto, can I talk to you?

03:50.939 --> 03:51.857
Yeah.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.274
How is your lovely wife?

03:53.316 --> 03:55.903
You know, you should start

03:53.316 --> 03:55.903
having babies right away.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.278
And you must breast-feed.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.279
Yeah, listen.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.573
What happened

03:58.321 --> 03:59.573
to Bill and Andy?

03:59.614 --> 04:01.449
Neither one of them showed up

03:59.614 --> 04:01.449
for their shifts today.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.285
Bill and Andy are on vacation.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.285
I thought I told you.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.746
Well, who's supposed to

04:04.327 --> 04:05.746
be covering for them?

04:05.787 --> 04:07.288
Let us have a look.

04:07.330 --> 04:08.373
Ah, here.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.292
You see?

04:08.415 --> 04:11.292
Alex and Dan are filling in.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.712
No. You let them go fishing

04:11.334 --> 04:13.712
until next Wednesday.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.005
Otto, I think

04:13.754 --> 04:15.005
it's wonderful

04:15.047 --> 04:16.297
that you're so

04:15.047 --> 04:16.297
accommodating,

04:16.339 --> 04:18.217
but sometimes you

04:16.339 --> 04:18.217
just have to say no.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.551
I mean,

04:18.258 --> 04:19.551
you're running a business.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.844
Wait a second.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.516
Is that the same dog from July?

04:27.601 --> 04:30.604
Orientation:

04:27.601 --> 04:30.604
North Hall, two-six.

04:32.189 --> 04:36.317
All right, it's okay.

04:32.189 --> 04:36.317
I'll find it. It's cool.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.200
Is this the North Quad?

04:43.242 --> 04:45.535
(chuckling):

04:43.242 --> 04:45.535
Oh, man.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.328
CYNTHIA:

04:45.577 --> 04:47.328
Malcolm!

04:47.370 --> 04:50.040
Malcolm!

04:50.082 --> 04:52.333
Hey, silly,

04:50.082 --> 04:52.333
we're over here.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.044
Malcolm.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.336
Have you looked at these

04:55.378 --> 04:57.338
Rorschach tests

04:55.378 --> 04:57.338
they're calling maps?

04:57.380 --> 04:58.339
Yeah, they're confusing,

04:57.380 --> 04:58.339
but do you guys

04:58.381 --> 04:59.633
think you can talk

04:58.381 --> 04:59.633
a little softer?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.176
I'm ready...

05:01.218 --> 05:02.385
to cry.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.386
They're not to scale.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.721
How do they expect

05:03.428 --> 05:04.721
anyone to use

05:04.763 --> 05:05.764
a map that's

05:04.763 --> 05:05.764
not to scale?

05:05.806 --> 05:07.348
Guys...

05:07.390 --> 05:08.934
Come on, this

05:07.390 --> 05:08.934
is exciting.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.852
I mean, I'm so

05:08.976 --> 05:10.852
disoriented.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.563
Keep me away from

05:10.894 --> 05:13.563
the heavy machinery.

05:13.605 --> 05:16.357
(hysterical laughter)

05:16.399 --> 05:17.400
Where are you going?

05:19.069 --> 05:21.529
I told you we should have

05:19.069 --> 05:21.529
taken a dry run last week!

05:21.571 --> 05:23.282
But, no,

05:21.571 --> 05:23.282
"Dabney's an alarmist!"

05:23.323 --> 05:25.200
Well, now look where we are!

05:25.242 --> 05:28.245
Fill out both health forms

05:25.242 --> 05:28.245
and your emergency contact card.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.164
And feel free

05:28.287 --> 05:30.164
to button your top.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.082
Boys like a little mystery.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.961
This is fun.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.337
I don't know why

05:36.003 --> 05:38.337
we avoided this for so long.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.828
(gasps)

06:07.742 --> 06:09.828
Mine!

06:14.457 --> 06:15.834
Mine.

06:18.337 --> 06:20.339
Okay, so yesterday

06:18.337 --> 06:20.339
wasn't too bad.

06:20.379 --> 06:21.673
I didn't make

06:20.379 --> 06:21.673
any new friends,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.925
but I did manage

06:21.715 --> 06:23.925
to avoid all my old ones.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.303
I'll make it up to them

06:23.967 --> 06:26.303
once I'm popular.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.471
Who am I kidding?

06:26.345 --> 06:28.471
No, I won't.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.514
CYNTHIA:

06:28.513 --> 06:29.514
Malcolm!

06:29.556 --> 06:31.432
Malcolm!

06:31.474 --> 06:32.726
This is the spot

06:32.767 --> 06:34.686
where we'll meet

06:32.767 --> 06:34.686
for lunch, okay?

06:36.479 --> 06:39.398
Malcolm,

06:36.479 --> 06:39.398
did you hear her?

06:46.948 --> 06:49.368
Here you go.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.368
Thanks.

06:49.408 --> 06:50.535
Hi. I can take

06:49.408 --> 06:50.535
over from here.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.870
Thank you very much.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.462
Excuse me.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.462
I can't use this book.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.463
I need to switch.

07:02.505 --> 07:04.632
What did you do?

07:04.674 --> 07:07.261
Nothing. I...

07:04.674 --> 07:07.261
You can't bring the book back

07:04.674 --> 07:07.261
in this condition.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.678
No, I just got it like this.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.471
I don't think so.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.471
If you want another book,

07:10.513 --> 07:12.099
you're going to have

07:10.513 --> 07:12.099
to pay $40 for it.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.433
Next.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.478
Mom, you have to

07:15.769 --> 07:17.478
talk to this lady.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.064
She won't let me

07:17.520 --> 07:19.064
return this book.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.648
Oh, my God.

07:20.690 --> 07:23.277
What did you do

07:20.690 --> 07:23.277
to your pants?

07:23.318 --> 07:24.485
What?

07:24.527 --> 07:25.946
Oh, for crying out loud.

07:25.987 --> 07:28.031
How did you get

07:25.987 --> 07:28.031
a stain there already?

07:29.032 --> 07:30.075
Mom, come on.

07:30.117 --> 07:30.992
It wasn't there

07:30.117 --> 07:30.992
this morning.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.493
Mom, stop. It's no big deal.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.703
No big deal?

07:33.745 --> 07:36.206
You begged me

07:33.745 --> 07:36.206
for these pants.

07:36.248 --> 07:37.999
You almost started crying

07:36.248 --> 07:37.999
in the store when

07:38.041 --> 07:39.209
I wasn't going

07:38.041 --> 07:39.209
to buy them

07:39.251 --> 07:41.086
for you, and now look

07:39.251 --> 07:41.086
what you did to them.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.589
That looks like that's

07:41.128 --> 07:44.589
coming from the inside.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.883
Mom, leave me alone.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.883
You're embarrassing me.

07:46.925 --> 07:49.386
Oh, I am not

07:46.925 --> 07:49.386
embarrassing you.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.971
Would you be

07:49.428 --> 07:50.971
embarrassed by this?

07:51.012 --> 07:52.764
No. See? Come on.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.267
See if we can find some

07:52.806 --> 07:55.267
club soda and get that out.

07:58.186 --> 07:59.687
Justice...

07:59.729 --> 08:02.190
is swift.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.984
DEWEY:

08:02.232 --> 08:03.984
I also think we should we have

08:04.025 --> 08:05.944
meat loaf on Mondays

08:04.025 --> 08:05.944
and not on Tuesdays

08:05.986 --> 08:09.030
so we can have an extra day

08:05.986 --> 08:09.030
of meat loaf sandwiches.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.243
I also think the table should

08:10.573 --> 08:13.243
be in front of the TV

08:13.285 --> 08:16.037
and the couch should

08:13.285 --> 08:16.037
be in front of the refrigerator.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.580
I also think

08:17.622 --> 08:19.624
there should be hand-me-ups

08:17.622 --> 08:19.624
instead of hand-me-downs,

08:19.666 --> 08:21.251
I think kids

08:19.666 --> 08:21.251
should be able to steer,

08:21.293 --> 08:24.129
and I think school should

08:21.293 --> 08:24.129
be only four hours a day

08:24.171 --> 08:26.547
and should be held

08:24.171 --> 08:26.547
on top of the building.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.715
I also think...

08:27.757 --> 08:30.051
Okay, Angela

08:27.757 --> 08:30.051
comes back tomorrow.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.220
So she can cover for Todd

08:30.093 --> 08:32.220
on the nature hike

08:32.262 --> 08:34.181
and, that way, Todd can

08:32.262 --> 08:34.181
help out in the kitchen

08:34.222 --> 08:36.016
which will free up Sonja

08:34.222 --> 08:36.016
to do the hayride.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.518
That is such a good plan.

08:39.478 --> 08:41.480
Angela's vacation

08:39.478 --> 08:41.480
is over, right?

08:41.521 --> 08:43.231
I extended it.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.275
It rained her first two days.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.194
(kisses)

08:48.195 --> 08:49.446
Kiss your mint.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.573
Okay, got to make up

08:50.613 --> 08:52.573
some ground.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.825
Here's what I'm going to do--

08:53.867 --> 08:55.785
be the first freshman

08:53.867 --> 08:55.785
with a girlfriend.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.496
It's worth a shot, right?

08:57.537 --> 09:00.415
I was going to give it a few

08:57.537 --> 09:00.415
weeks before asking someone out.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.418
Wait till I liked some girl,

09:00.457 --> 09:03.418
she liked me... whatever.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.045
But I'll just move it up.

09:06.796 --> 09:07.755
Hi.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.383
Oh. Hey, Stain.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.467
What?

09:10.509 --> 09:11.676
Hey, Stain.

09:13.136 --> 09:14.429
Stain.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.432
Thank you.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.600
Hey, Stain.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.602
Yo, Stain, what's up?

09:24.356 --> 09:25.482
Don't pass out.

09:25.524 --> 09:26.858
Breathe in through your nose.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.776
You can pull this out.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.654
Will you be my girlfriend?

09:43.542 --> 09:44.625
How's it going?

09:44.667 --> 09:46.627
Look, every bulletin

09:44.667 --> 09:46.627
is lined up perfectly

09:46.669 --> 09:49.630
with the one next to it

09:46.669 --> 09:49.630
and the one above and below.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.508
Thumbtacks just bring out

09:49.672 --> 09:51.508
this side in me.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.634
(chuckling):

09:51.550 --> 09:53.634
Very nice.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.636
You know, it's weird being

09:53.676 --> 09:55.636
back in high school.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.638
But it's kind

09:55.678 --> 09:57.638
of fun, too.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.890
Brings back memories.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.559
Yeah. Does it?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.559
Yeah.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.143
Well!

10:00.600 --> 10:02.143
What have we here?

10:02.185 --> 10:03.811
Have you finished cleaning up

10:02.185 --> 10:03.811
the cigarette butts

10:03.853 --> 10:04.896
on the football field?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.523
I'll get to it.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.316
You know, we alone determine

10:08.358 --> 10:11.111
how much we get

10:08.358 --> 10:11.111
out of any given experience.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.947
I said, I'll get to it.

10:18.410 --> 10:19.660
Jerkabe.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.079
You're so bad.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.665
Am I?

10:24.707 --> 10:26.418
What's that look?

10:28.128 --> 10:30.505
You're dreaming.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.839
Forget it.

10:30.547 --> 10:31.839
Don't be stupid.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.716
There are too many

10:31.881 --> 10:33.716
people around.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.177
We'd get caught for sure.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.973
It wouldn't be fun.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.144
It wouldn't be comfortable.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.564
There's no good place.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.693
This utility closet

10:49.316 --> 10:52.693
will be locked for sure.

10:54.737 --> 10:57.574
There's no room

10:54.737 --> 10:57.574
for two people in here.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.955
(mambo music playing)

11:27.145 --> 11:28.396
(music stops)

11:28.438 --> 11:30.106
Hey, Malcolm.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.732
I'm the fool!

11:31.774 --> 11:33.734
I'm the one who thought

11:31.774 --> 11:33.734
there was such a thing

11:33.776 --> 11:35.111
as kindness and decency in life!

11:35.153 --> 11:36.695
Okay.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.740
Mr. Herkabe!

11:39.782 --> 11:41.742
Mr. Herkabe,

11:39.782 --> 11:41.742
uh, listen, uh,

11:41.784 --> 11:44.787
I've spent the last

11:41.784 --> 11:44.787
half hour... thinking,

11:44.829 --> 11:48.749
and, uh, now that I've

11:44.829 --> 11:48.749
had a chance to cool off,

11:48.791 --> 11:51.169
I-I just wanted to

11:48.791 --> 11:51.169
apologize for earlier.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.629
Oh?

11:52.671 --> 11:54.839
Yeah. I mean, you were

11:52.671 --> 11:54.839
just doing your job.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.425
Well, your apology is noted

11:54.881 --> 11:57.425
and not accepted.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.010
What?!

11:59.052 --> 12:00.803
Come on, I said

11:59.052 --> 12:00.803
I was sorry.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.139
Well, it's a little late

12:00.845 --> 12:03.139
for that.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.766
You're hereby expelled

12:03.181 --> 12:05.766
from the program!

12:05.808 --> 12:06.476
What?!

12:06.518 --> 12:07.435
Remove yourself

12:07.477 --> 12:08.769
from school property

12:07.477 --> 12:08.769
immediately.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.064
Good day, sir.

12:12.899 --> 12:15.151
It's just so exciting

12:12.899 --> 12:15.151
to be part of something

12:15.193 --> 12:16.444
from the very beginning.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.696
Stain.

12:17.736 --> 12:18.779
It's classic.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.281
It's one of those rare nicknames

12:20.323 --> 12:21.866
that will stick

12:20.323 --> 12:21.866
with a person forever

12:21.908 --> 12:24.202
because they are so perfect

12:21.908 --> 12:24.202
in their cruelty.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.786
Hey, you know what's weird?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.786
It's actually

12:25.828 --> 12:27.414
wiping out my memory

12:25.828 --> 12:27.414
of your old name.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.040
Is it Monty?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.375
Marco?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.792
Murgatroyd?

12:31.834 --> 12:34.379
HAL:  Oh, that pompous

12:31.834 --> 12:34.379
little martinet!

12:34.421 --> 12:35.880
You should have

12:34.421 --> 12:35.880
seen his face!

12:35.922 --> 12:37.798
Hal, it's crazy to

12:35.922 --> 12:37.798
be upset by this.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.718
You didn't want

12:37.840 --> 12:39.718
to do it anyway.

12:39.758 --> 12:40.801
He didn't know that!

12:40.843 --> 12:42.262
That means

12:40.843 --> 12:42.262
he thinks he won.

12:42.303 --> 12:43.597
Which means

12:42.303 --> 12:43.597
I think I lost!

12:43.638 --> 12:44.681
But not for long, Lois.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.015
Ho-ho, not for long!

12:46.057 --> 12:49.394
(sotto voce): I want it

12:46.057 --> 12:49.394
delivered at 3:00.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.854
I don't mean on

12:49.436 --> 12:51.854
the truck at 3:00.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.648
I mean  here  at 3:00.

12:53.690 --> 12:57.818
Not 3:05. Not 3:10. 3:00.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.863
Good. My son will

12:57.860 --> 13:00.863
sign for it.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.450
Hi. You called for a massage?

13:03.491 --> 13:05.826
Oh, yeah, yeah,

13:03.491 --> 13:05.826
come on in.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.662
Just set up right there.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.122
This is so great.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.832
I hope you're good

13:09.163 --> 13:11.832
with lower back pain.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.043
Uh, yeah. Absolutely.

13:14.085 --> 13:18.256
I specialize in...

13:14.085 --> 13:18.256
vertebrae... sciatic...

13:18.298 --> 13:19.840
impactions of the back.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.342
Oh, that

13:19.882 --> 13:21.342
sounds perfect!

13:23.553 --> 13:24.845
Happy anniversary, honey.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.055
I'm going to be

13:24.887 --> 13:26.055
in the salon.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.266
Take your time.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.643
(gasps)

13:29.684 --> 13:31.728
Face up or face down?

13:31.770 --> 13:33.146
Why, what are you

13:31.770 --> 13:33.146
going to do to me?

13:33.187 --> 13:35.482
The massage.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.317
Oh, yeah.

13:37.358 --> 13:41.028
(man groaning)

13:41.070 --> 13:44.282
Oh... oh, there it is!

13:44.324 --> 13:47.118
Ah, yeah, baby. Oh...

13:50.371 --> 13:51.914
(whimpering)

13:57.378 --> 14:01.382
Oh! That's the sign

13:57.378 --> 14:01.382
of a good massage.

14:01.424 --> 14:04.260
Oh! That means

14:01.424 --> 14:04.260
I'm totally relaxed.

14:04.302 --> 14:06.095
(grunts)

14:31.329 --> 14:33.873
♪ ♪

15:04.237 --> 15:07.574
We don't mean to inflict

15:04.237 --> 15:07.574
ourselves on you,

15:07.615 --> 15:09.950
but there's no

15:07.615 --> 15:09.950
other places.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.994
Look, we know you've had

15:09.992 --> 15:11.994
a rough couple of days,

15:12.036 --> 15:13.954
but things are about

15:12.036 --> 15:13.954
to get better.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.207
We joined...

15:16.249 --> 15:17.958
the chess club.

15:18.000 --> 15:18.959
They love geniuses!

15:19.001 --> 15:20.002
I was voted king.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.671
I'm the queen--

15:21.713 --> 15:23.840
which is actually the

15:21.713 --> 15:23.840
more powerful position.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.383
And they're excited

15:23.882 --> 15:25.383
to meet you, too.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.677
I told them your opinion

15:25.425 --> 15:27.677
on the Luzhin defense.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.012
It raised a few eyebrows,

15:27.719 --> 15:30.012
but you're as good as in.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.059
I don't deserve you guys.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.062
I'm sorry I ignored you,

15:35.101 --> 15:38.062
and I appreciate the gesture,

15:38.104 --> 15:40.607
but you're really better off

15:38.104 --> 15:40.607
without me.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.982
Oh, come on.

15:42.024 --> 15:43.777
Will you get off

15:42.024 --> 15:43.777
this sulking thing?

15:43.818 --> 15:44.985
Since when do you care

15:45.027 --> 15:46.613
what other people

15:45.027 --> 15:46.613
think of you?

15:46.654 --> 15:47.697
Cynthia, don't do this.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.490
Malcolm, you

15:47.739 --> 15:49.490
hate everyone.

15:49.532 --> 15:53.453
To you, everyone's either

15:49.532 --> 15:53.453
a moron or a creep or a poseur.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.581
Why do you suddenly care

15:53.494 --> 15:56.581
about their opinion of you?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.416
Because I'm shallow, okay?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.587
I want them to like me.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.505
It's not so bad, Malcolm.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.466
It's only the first week.

16:06.507 --> 16:10.094
You have, like, four years

16:06.507 --> 16:10.094
of high school left.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.721
It's okay.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.681
I spent three years

16:11.763 --> 16:13.681
being a Krelboyne.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.475
I can spend four years

16:13.723 --> 16:15.475
being a joke.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.184
Malcolm, you're

16:15.516 --> 16:17.184
not a joke.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.185
Hey, Stainalator!

16:18.227 --> 16:20.104
Bruce Spring-stain.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.655
What are you doing?

16:28.696 --> 16:30.030
Mopping.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.116
In five minutes, I will

16:30.072 --> 16:32.116
have my two hours,

16:32.158 --> 16:33.493
and that will discharge

16:32.158 --> 16:33.493
my obligation

16:33.534 --> 16:35.035
to the volunteer program.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.622
Oh, no, it does not,

16:35.077 --> 16:37.622
because you have been expelled.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.874
All I know is

16:37.664 --> 16:39.874
I've been mopping!

16:39.916 --> 16:43.043
And this floor looks

16:39.916 --> 16:43.043
pretty darn clean to me.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.338
But that was

16:43.085 --> 16:45.338
unauthorized mopping.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.424
It is spotless, and maybe

16:45.379 --> 16:48.424
we should just see whether

16:48.466 --> 16:51.845
the principal thinks

16:48.466 --> 16:51.845
it's a job well done.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.095
It's not even clean.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.098
Don't you dare!

16:57.099 --> 16:58.434
No!

16:58.476 --> 16:59.769
(grunts)

16:59.811 --> 17:00.895
(whimpers)

17:03.063 --> 17:04.315
(evil laughter)

17:04.357 --> 17:06.317
Now let's see if you're...

17:11.113 --> 17:12.031
(grunts)

17:16.744 --> 17:18.705
(yells)

17:18.746 --> 17:21.081
(gasping)

17:23.334 --> 17:26.504
(yelling)

17:34.012 --> 17:35.889
I'd just like to say

17:35.930 --> 17:37.974
in my defense...

17:38.016 --> 17:40.351
he started it.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
Ah, Francis,

17:46.148 --> 17:48.108
there you are.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.110
Oh, look at you

17:48.150 --> 17:50.110
tidying up.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.111
Otto, we have to talk.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.530
We will talk tomorrow.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.948
Come, I want to

17:52.572 --> 17:53.948
show you something.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.034
No! Tomorrow I may be

17:53.990 --> 17:56.034
leading aerobics again

17:56.075 --> 17:58.745
or faking my way

17:56.075 --> 17:58.745
through a wine-tasting seminar

17:58.786 --> 18:01.288
or-or playing the prostitute

17:58.786 --> 18:01.288
in the Old West stunt show.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.582
That  was  you!

18:02.623 --> 18:04.124
The way you run this place,

18:04.166 --> 18:06.002
sometimes it's not being nice.

18:06.044 --> 18:08.128
It's-it's being careless

18:06.044 --> 18:08.128
and foolish.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.714
Look.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.925
(Otto chuckling)

18:11.966 --> 18:13.384
Yes, it's a truck.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.595
Look, Otto, I don't want

18:13.426 --> 18:15.595
to leave you high and...

18:15.636 --> 18:17.638
It is  your  truck.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.638
What?

18:17.680 --> 18:19.306
I saw it...

18:17.680 --> 18:19.306
I thought of you.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.934
Your car blew up, yeah?

18:20.975 --> 18:23.227
I thought  this  would

18:20.975 --> 18:23.227
be a good thing for you.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.189
You see, this is what

18:24.812 --> 18:27.189
I'm talking about.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.567
You are the best boss ever!

18:29.609 --> 18:32.152
I wish I could tell you

18:29.609 --> 18:32.152
to take a few days

18:32.194 --> 18:34.363
and drive it

18:32.194 --> 18:34.363
someplace nice,

18:34.405 --> 18:36.156
but we're

18:34.405 --> 18:36.156
a little shorthanded.

18:36.198 --> 18:37.867
I understand,

18:36.198 --> 18:37.867
believe me.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.159
(laughs)

18:37.909 --> 18:39.159
Just kidding!

18:39.201 --> 18:41.037
Go. Take a week. Have fun.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.204
(laughing)

18:42.246 --> 18:44.624
Malcolm!

18:44.665 --> 18:47.460
Malcolm, hey,

18:44.665 --> 18:47.460
come to the "Y" with me.

18:47.501 --> 18:51.672
I think a good yoga class

18:47.501 --> 18:51.672
would really help center you.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.215
A-And there  are  boys.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.968
Mom's here!

18:53.257 --> 18:54.968
What?

18:55.009 --> 18:56.970
Dad got in trouble.

18:55.009 --> 18:56.970
Mom is freaking out.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.846
Whatever you do,

18:57.011 --> 18:58.846
stay out of her way.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.099
Oh, my God.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.267
I know what I'm

19:01.140 --> 19:03.267
going to do.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.394
What are you talking about?

19:05.436 --> 19:08.188
I'm going get sent

19:05.436 --> 19:08.188
to military school.

19:10.399 --> 19:11.651
Malcolm!

19:11.692 --> 19:14.361
Malcolm!

19:14.403 --> 19:16.614
What are you doing?

19:16.656 --> 19:18.783
My dad has

19:16.656 --> 19:18.783
a hide-a-key.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.076
Here we go.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.203
I don't want

19:21.702 --> 19:23.203
to be a stickler,

19:23.245 --> 19:26.206
but you don't have

19:23.245 --> 19:26.206
the right decal for this lot.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.207
Malcolm, stop this.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.459
You don't have

19:27.249 --> 19:28.459
a license.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.044
That's okay. I'm just going

19:30.086 --> 19:31.420
to crash into my mom's car.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.297
This is crazy, Malcolm!

19:35.508 --> 19:37.217
This is the

19:35.508 --> 19:37.217
stupidest thing

19:37.259 --> 19:38.218
I've ever heard.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.679
No, it's not, it's smart.

19:39.720 --> 19:42.140
I just take this car

19:39.720 --> 19:42.140
and crash it into that car.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.391
Then I'll be in military school

19:42.181 --> 19:44.391
just like Francis was.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.102
It'll be paradise.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.271
Somebody... with feet...

19:49.313 --> 19:50.439
stop him!

19:50.481 --> 19:51.732
For the love of God,

19:51.774 --> 19:53.067
your shirttail's stuck

19:51.774 --> 19:53.067
in the door!

19:53.109 --> 19:55.820
Take me with you!

19:55.862 --> 19:57.113
What's going on?

19:55.862 --> 19:57.113
I don't know, man.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.240
Stop!

20:00.282 --> 20:01.534
I won't let you do this!

20:01.575 --> 20:03.661
I would rather die

20:01.575 --> 20:03.661
than be left alone with Mom!

20:03.703 --> 20:04.662
Get out of the way!

20:04.704 --> 20:06.122
No!

20:06.164 --> 20:08.248
You can run me over.

20:06.164 --> 20:08.248
I don't care!

20:08.290 --> 20:09.792
(revving engine)

20:08.290 --> 20:09.792
(screams)

20:14.296 --> 20:16.256
Malcolm!

20:16.298 --> 20:17.717
If you do this,

20:17.758 --> 20:20.053
I will never have sex

20:17.758 --> 20:20.053
with you again.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.971
Again?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.514
They had sex?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.514
He had sex with her?

20:23.556 --> 20:26.059
GIRL:

20:23.556 --> 20:26.059
That kid had sex?

20:26.100 --> 20:27.727
GIRL:

20:26.100 --> 20:27.727
She's a slut.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.269
BOY:

20:27.768 --> 20:29.269
She's a big slut.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.230
GIRL:

20:29.311 --> 20:31.230
Oh, my God,

20:29.311 --> 20:31.230
what a slut.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.194
Wow, I could really learn

20:34.025 --> 20:36.194
a lesson from this,

20:36.235 --> 20:37.862
but all I can think about

20:36.235 --> 20:37.862
right now

20:37.904 --> 20:40.447
is how the whole school

20:37.904 --> 20:40.447
is convinced that I had se...

20:40.489 --> 20:42.449
You get out of that car

20:40.489 --> 20:42.449
this instant!

20:42.491 --> 20:44.284
What the heck is

20:42.491 --> 20:44.284
wrong with you?!

20:44.326 --> 20:45.953
Here, take my pancakes.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.705
Oh, and I did your laundry.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.749
I folded them warm so

20:47.747 --> 20:49.749
they wouldn't wrinkle.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.876
Reese, I'm not going

20:49.790 --> 20:51.876
to tell you about it.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.127
It didn't even happen.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.294
Okay.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.296
Where  didn't it happen?

20:58.591 --> 21:00.509
Son, I know

20:58.591 --> 21:00.509
it's been tough for you

21:00.551 --> 21:03.512
spending all your time

21:00.551 --> 21:03.512
by yourself after school.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.305
I've been trying to adjust.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.183
Well, guess what.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.183
You don't have to anymore.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.308
That's all over now.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.769
I rearranged

21:08.350 --> 21:09.769
my schedule

21:09.810 --> 21:11.562
so I can get

21:09.810 --> 21:11.562
home earlier.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.689
Isn't that great?

21:11.604 --> 21:13.689
We're going to spend

21:13.731 --> 21:15.775
a lot more time together.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.775
What do you say,

21:15.816 --> 21:17.693
this weekend, you help me

21:15.816 --> 21:17.693
clean out the garage?
