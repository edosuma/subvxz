00:12.620 --> 00:15.488
Hey guys, Coolduder
here with another video.

00:15.490 --> 00:17.738
Ever since I did my video in my DVD room,

00:17.740 --> 00:19.658
talking about how it's haunted

00:19.660 --> 00:22.242
and that sometimes I see a ghost in here

00:22.244 --> 00:23.178
and all that kind of stuff,

00:23.180 --> 00:27.258
you guys have been bugging
me again and again and again

00:27.260 --> 00:29.748
with videos requesting, since I must live

00:29.750 --> 00:33.328
in some sort of a haunted house
or a haunted establishment

00:33.330 --> 00:36.328
or this room is haunted,
or I have like a evil,

00:36.330 --> 00:39.218
haunted spirit bothering
me or something like that,

00:39.220 --> 00:40.988
you guys continuously want me

00:40.990 --> 00:44.478
to do more haunted type videos.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.638
And one of the things I've
been getting a request

00:46.640 --> 00:49.778
is a new challenge called
The Bloody Nun Challenge.

00:49.780 --> 00:51.248
I don't really know if it's new,

00:51.250 --> 00:53.090
but I've been hearing about it now.

00:53.092 --> 00:53.928
It's like, it's one of those things

00:53.930 --> 00:55.758
where you go in front of the mirror

00:55.760 --> 00:58.518
and you say the name
"Bloody Nun" three times

00:58.520 --> 01:00.458
and you're supposed to see the nun

01:00.460 --> 01:03.648
or something spooky supposed to happen.

01:03.650 --> 01:05.147
But it's a new big thing

01:05.150 --> 01:08.088
that you guys are
continuously bugging me about.

01:08.090 --> 01:10.478
You know, I like doing my channel videos

01:10.480 --> 01:13.818
about DVDs and Blu-rays and reviewing them

01:13.820 --> 01:15.108
and talking about them.

01:15.110 --> 01:18.188
That's what I like,
that's what I enjoy doing.

01:18.190 --> 01:21.488
But because of that damn video
about my haunted DVD room,

01:21.490 --> 01:23.118
it's continuous now,

01:23.120 --> 01:26.758
you want more and more
haunted type videos.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.998
So I have to do this damn
Bloody Nun Challenge,

01:29.000 --> 01:31.598
at least to quiet you guys
down for a little bit.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.358
You know, I'm sure absolutely
nothing will happen.

01:35.360 --> 01:38.058
So maybe after that, you
guys will leave me alone

01:38.060 --> 01:40.348
and let me, you know, and do
my DVD and Blu-ray reviews.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.358
Even though I know this
place is probably haunted

01:43.360 --> 01:46.028
after what I saw, I'm not
really worried about it,

01:46.030 --> 01:47.068
it doesn't really matter to me

01:47.070 --> 01:49.888
because I like sitting here,
sitting in front of the TV

01:49.890 --> 01:52.278
and just watching stuff, lounging around,

01:52.280 --> 01:53.378
that's what I do.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.028
Then I sit down on my
couch and I review 'em

01:56.030 --> 01:57.038
and tell you guys about 'em.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.368
That's what I enjoy doing.

01:58.370 --> 02:00.298
I don't like doing haunted videos.

02:00.300 --> 02:03.618
I don't wanna go to a
graveyard and do etches

02:03.620 --> 02:07.408
and etch out the names of
the graveyard or do seances.

02:07.410 --> 02:09.937
I really do not like doing that.

02:09.940 --> 02:13.508
That's not fun to me,
that's in no way exciting.

02:13.510 --> 02:17.878
So please stop asking,
but to shut you all up,

02:17.880 --> 02:19.988
hopefully, you know, once and for all,

02:19.990 --> 02:21.078
for at least a little while

02:21.080 --> 02:24.218
I'm gonna do this stupid
ass Bloody Nun Challenge.

02:24.220 --> 02:26.048
So I'm gonna head to the bathroom.

02:26.050 --> 02:27.688
Don't worry, you're
not gonna see anything,

02:27.690 --> 02:28.818
I'm not showing anything in the bathroom,

02:28.820 --> 02:30.068
I'm just gonna stand
in front of the mirror.

02:30.070 --> 02:31.758
If any of you were
wondering about that stuff,

02:31.760 --> 02:33.718
I wouldn't be putting
that up online anyway.

02:33.720 --> 02:36.108
And if I was gonna put it up
online it would not be free.

02:36.110 --> 02:38.368
You'd have to pay for something like that.

02:38.370 --> 02:40.338
But I'm gonna head to the bathroom now

02:40.340 --> 02:42.058
and do this stupid ass challenge

02:42.060 --> 02:43.178
which just seems like a copy

02:43.180 --> 02:44.968
of other challenges that I've heard.

02:44.970 --> 02:46.178
But you guys want it.

02:46.180 --> 02:47.758
And you know, someone
put this that, you know

02:47.760 --> 02:48.968
as a response to do it

02:48.970 --> 02:51.488
and you all keep thumbing
it up and saying to do it

02:51.490 --> 02:52.858
and saying I don't do anything else

02:52.860 --> 02:54.548
besides the DVD and Blu-ray reviews.

02:54.550 --> 02:56.108
So I'm gonna do the Bloody Nun challenge.

02:56.110 --> 02:59.108
So let's head to the bathroom,
do the stupid ass challenge

02:59.110 --> 03:00.798
and then please leave me alone,

03:00.800 --> 03:03.328
or come up with something
else, you know, movie related

03:03.330 --> 03:06.128
'cause I do not wanna do
anything like this again.

03:06.130 --> 03:08.730
So let's just do this and
then get it over it, okay.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.488
All right guys, here we
go at this stupid thing

03:15.490 --> 03:18.458
like I said, this is
not the kind of thing,

03:18.460 --> 03:20.628
the thing that I do, these
are not the kind of videos

03:20.630 --> 03:23.648
I do on this channel, this
a movie related channel.

03:23.650 --> 03:26.708
And you all are really,
really, really bugging me

03:26.710 --> 03:30.358
about this stupid shit to do,
these stupid kind of videos.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.978
But like I said, maybe if I do this

03:32.980 --> 03:35.978
you'll leave me alone
and quit talking to me

03:35.980 --> 03:40.408
and asking me to do stupid
bullshit ghost stuff.

03:40.410 --> 03:42.238
So, okay, we're gonna do it, all right?

03:42.240 --> 03:44.128
So we're gonna do it and see what happens.

03:44.130 --> 03:48.438
And I'm sure absolutely nothing
is gonna happen whatsoever.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.048
So let's just do it. All right.

03:50.050 --> 03:51.963
So I have to say this or
I have to say the thing,

03:51.965 --> 03:54.148
I'm not gonna to say it
till it's time to say it.

03:54.150 --> 03:54.983
All right.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.383
Bloody Nun.

03:58.890 --> 03:59.723
Bloody Nun.

04:01.000 --> 04:01.833
Bloody Nun.

07:14.990 --> 07:18.423
My name is Father Gordon Herschell.

07:19.810 --> 07:21.933
This is my written confession.

07:23.030 --> 07:25.238
I am recording this confession

07:25.240 --> 07:30.240
to prove that I have not
been possessed by a demon.

07:31.613 --> 07:34.798
I had been a priest for 40 years.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.743
I am one of the top
exorcists in the world.

07:39.900 --> 07:42.038
I have helped many people

07:42.040 --> 07:44.883
and cast out many demons.

07:46.560 --> 07:50.298
During my stay in Rome at the Vatican,

07:50.300 --> 07:53.768
I experienced something so evil,

07:53.770 --> 07:57.168
a nun, Sister Maria,

07:57.170 --> 08:00.733
she was overtaken and
possessed by a demon.

08:01.820 --> 08:05.308
This demon feeds on the weak.

08:05.310 --> 08:09.298
It feeds on nuns who are weak

08:09.300 --> 08:11.743
and have doubts in their faith.

08:12.770 --> 08:15.483
This demon is called Valak.

08:16.510 --> 08:19.148
It is evil and powerful.

08:19.150 --> 08:23.398
It is attacking and
taking hold of our sisters

08:23.400 --> 08:27.303
and using them to do evil and kill.

08:28.660 --> 08:33.107
One night as I left my
quarters, I saw her walking

08:33.110 --> 08:36.303
and felt an evil presence in the air.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.902
I approached her and she attacked me.

09:14.760 --> 09:18.533
I tried to pray with her
and cast the demon out,

09:19.790 --> 09:21.878
it was too strong.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.423
She was going to kill me.

09:26.040 --> 09:29.939
I defended myself and I killed her.

09:34.850 --> 09:38.520
I hid the body and came back to America.

09:56.490 --> 09:59.418
I heard of a story that
happened in New York,

09:59.420 --> 10:04.193
a nun in a cabin
murdering a group of kids.

10:05.460 --> 10:07.938
I feel it is too late.

10:07.940 --> 10:12.818
And this demon, Valak, is too powerful.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.148
I can feel her near.

10:15.150 --> 10:18.348
She is haunting me.

10:18.350 --> 10:22.453
I could not get that face out of my head.

10:24.540 --> 10:28.150
And I feel such guilt

10:32.010 --> 10:35.343
for killing Sister Maria.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.394
I can't go on.

11:14.380 --> 11:17.233
Father, forgive me.

12:13.425 --> 12:15.063
Hello, Mateo.

12:15.065 --> 12:16.223
Hello to you as well, Father.

12:16.225 --> 12:17.993
You seem to have a lot
on your mind tonight.

12:17.995 --> 12:19.293
Yes, do you?

12:19.295 --> 12:23.283
Sometimes thoughts can
plague us, even torture us.

12:23.285 --> 12:25.783
Well, that's where we have to have faith

12:25.785 --> 12:27.373
to help our thoughts.

12:27.375 --> 12:29.943
And I taught you about faith,

12:29.945 --> 12:31.685
all's we need is a mustard seed

12:33.365 --> 12:34.603
that heals the sick.

12:34.605 --> 12:35.503
It's all we need.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.933
But you wanna know something, Mateo?

12:37.935 --> 12:39.133
I don't know where you're
going with this, Father,

12:39.135 --> 12:41.283
but my guess is the devil?

12:41.285 --> 12:45.663
Well, I'm talking about
big voluptuous tits,

12:45.665 --> 12:48.903
hot girls in thongs, sexy small boobs,

12:48.905 --> 12:52.293
long legs, tight clean pussies,

12:52.295 --> 12:54.263
I'd just love to lick one.

12:54.265 --> 12:56.281
Excuse me, Father,

12:56.283 --> 12:57.953
have you been drinking?

12:57.955 --> 12:59.505
Of course I've been drinking.

13:00.735 --> 13:02.170
- Why would you-
- What is wrong?

13:02.172 --> 13:03.422
Well, what do you expect?

13:04.615 --> 13:06.418
I also have thoughts as well.

13:07.608 --> 13:10.063
You serve the Lord. I
look to you for guidance.

13:10.065 --> 13:12.233
I've been serving the
Lord for a long time

13:12.235 --> 13:14.963
and I've been listening
to a lot of confessions.

13:14.965 --> 13:18.238
And I really need to tell
you something, Mateo.

13:20.275 --> 13:21.813
Why, what is wrong? What is going on?

13:21.815 --> 13:24.673
I've also been jerking
off after the confessions.

13:24.675 --> 13:26.148
We can't succumb to this.

13:27.425 --> 13:29.198
We promised to serve the Lord.

13:30.455 --> 13:32.053
Well, things have changed

13:32.055 --> 13:34.453
and we've lost parishioners.

13:34.455 --> 13:36.383
I don't know how many
times to tell you this,

13:36.385 --> 13:39.403
I just feel like I'm
losing my verve for this

13:39.405 --> 13:42.023
and I can't get these
thoughts out of my head,

13:42.025 --> 13:43.588
whether they're dark or light.

13:44.704 --> 13:46.983
I understand these
thoughts can trouble you.

13:46.985 --> 13:48.663
To be honest, they've
been troubling me as well.

13:48.665 --> 13:52.013
But we have to do what we came here to do

13:52.015 --> 13:54.393
what you taught me to do, serve the Lord.

13:54.395 --> 13:56.063
Do you or do you not serve the Lord?

13:56.065 --> 13:57.613
Yes, I serve the Lord,

13:57.615 --> 13:58.863
but what makes me different,

13:58.865 --> 14:02.323
or you different than anyone
else who serves the Lord?

14:02.325 --> 14:04.383
We still get those same thoughts.

14:04.385 --> 14:05.563
I get those same thoughts.

14:05.565 --> 14:07.733
Mine might be worse than yours.

14:07.735 --> 14:08.566
I don't know, Father.

14:08.568 --> 14:10.213
I can't answer these questions,

14:10.215 --> 14:12.093
but I look to you to show me the way

14:12.095 --> 14:14.813
and tonight your influence
is doing more harm than good.

14:14.815 --> 14:18.003
Well, maybe you should
start looking somewhere else.

14:18.005 --> 14:21.878
Like maybe we should go to the house.

14:22.785 --> 14:23.616
The house?

14:23.618 --> 14:25.433
I'm gonna tell you one thing I've heard

14:25.435 --> 14:28.443
in this confession recently,
and it's about this house.

14:28.445 --> 14:31.293
There's this house that's
filled with hot chicks,

14:31.295 --> 14:34.153
real sexy bodies, all kinds
of things are going on there.

14:34.155 --> 14:38.603
Nobody will know if we go, we
can just go and keep it quiet.

14:38.605 --> 14:40.208
At some point it has to stop.

14:41.235 --> 14:42.533
How are we gonna stop this?

14:42.535 --> 14:44.277
We're only human.

14:44.279 --> 14:46.383
And we have to get this
cognitive dissonance

14:46.385 --> 14:48.903
out of our head, going
against the thoughts

14:48.905 --> 14:50.473
that we're supposed to believe

14:50.475 --> 14:52.623
and be our true nature,

14:52.625 --> 14:54.393
and be like other humans.

14:54.395 --> 14:57.193
I carry a burden every single day

14:57.195 --> 14:59.643
but every day from morning to sunrise

14:59.645 --> 15:01.673
I just try to live in his image better.

15:01.675 --> 15:03.038
I try harder every day.

15:04.115 --> 15:07.403
And now I don't know, I'm
starting to break, Father.

15:07.405 --> 15:10.143
Well, I'm starting to break too.

15:10.145 --> 15:11.583
So why don't we do this,

15:11.585 --> 15:14.903
let's just go to the
house and have some fun.

15:14.905 --> 15:16.498
Nobody's gonna know about it.

15:18.135 --> 15:20.347
That's what we should do.

15:20.349 --> 15:21.493
I don't know.

15:21.495 --> 15:23.403
Mateo, we can go to this house

15:23.405 --> 15:25.643
and if you don't wanna go,
I'm gonna go by myself.

15:25.645 --> 15:26.808
I wanna get laid.

15:27.795 --> 15:29.723
You may have lost your faith, Father,

15:29.725 --> 15:31.793
but I still have a chance to save souls.

15:31.795 --> 15:34.036
I've made my choice and
that was a long time ago

15:34.038 --> 15:35.563
when I decided to come here.

15:35.565 --> 15:38.213
I wanna go hook up with some hot chicks.

15:38.215 --> 15:39.423
I'm going back to my quarters.

15:39.425 --> 15:40.703
You have a good night.

15:40.705 --> 15:42.064
I'll pray for you.

16:30.184 --> 16:32.301
Hello, Gabriel.

16:32.303 --> 16:34.035
I've been waiting for you.

16:37.358 --> 16:38.775
Remove the cross.

16:44.039 --> 16:44.956
Come to me.

16:46.014 --> 16:48.329
I know you want this.

16:48.331 --> 16:50.664
I know what you do at night.

16:51.893 --> 16:55.810
I know about the cross
stressing and I like it.

16:56.882 --> 16:57.799
Come to me.

16:58.671 --> 17:00.254
Accept this amulet.

17:01.429 --> 17:03.673
Come to the dark side.

17:30.109 --> 17:32.835
Miss, have you seen Father Gabriel?

17:36.910 --> 17:39.048
Excuse me, miss.

17:39.050 --> 17:39.883
Are you lost?

17:41.270 --> 17:43.122
Is there something wrong?

17:45.693 --> 17:46.703
I don't recognize you.

17:46.705 --> 17:48.568
You're not one of the sisters here.

17:48.570 --> 17:50.648
Have you seen Father Gabriel?

17:50.650 --> 17:52.298
Father Gabriel?

17:52.300 --> 17:54.445
Don't worry about Father Gabriel.

17:54.447 --> 17:56.717
Father Gabriel, have you seen him?

17:57.683 --> 17:59.145
He's not here.

17:59.147 --> 18:02.147
But you're restless. Do you like it?

18:03.100 --> 18:04.800
Father Gabriel was a weaker man.

18:06.512 --> 18:09.068
You're a strong man.

18:09.070 --> 18:10.238
- Would you like to see-
- Strong man that serves

18:10.240 --> 18:11.071
the Lord.

18:14.359 --> 18:16.138
- I can't.
- I think you like this.

18:16.140 --> 18:18.985
- I can't, I can't.
- I think you like me.

18:18.987 --> 18:20.657
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can't.

18:20.659 --> 18:21.924
I can't do this.

18:21.926 --> 18:22.988
Is this a joke?

18:22.990 --> 18:24.338
You're making me really uncomfortable.

18:24.340 --> 18:25.446
Can I help with something?

18:25.448 --> 18:26.389
Are you lost?

18:32.043 --> 18:33.688
Here.

18:33.690 --> 18:34.523
Come taste.

18:36.211 --> 18:38.176
That's it.

18:38.178 --> 18:39.928
You know you want to.

18:41.496 --> 18:42.496
All for you.

18:47.780 --> 18:49.133
No, I can't!

19:14.900 --> 19:15.867
Hello, kind sir.

19:18.570 --> 19:20.278
And who are you?

19:20.280 --> 19:23.503
Would you care for some forbidden fruit?

19:25.530 --> 19:27.013
You won't tempt me.

19:28.020 --> 19:29.373
I know you're a demon.

19:31.452 --> 19:34.517
And I know all about you, demon hunter.

19:35.520 --> 19:40.513
But there are many of us and
we will not all be killed.

19:42.410 --> 19:44.448
Oh yes you will.

19:44.450 --> 19:46.340
It'll just be one at a time.

20:06.090 --> 20:07.652
Hello, Father.

20:07.654 --> 20:08.518
How are you doing today, sir?

20:08.520 --> 20:10.738
Is there something I can help you with?

20:10.740 --> 20:13.898
Actually, there's something
I can help you with.

20:13.900 --> 20:16.308
The Lord is my shepherd
and my guiding light.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.818
But what is it you can help me with?

20:18.820 --> 20:20.958
I can keep you from not
only losing your faith,

20:20.960 --> 20:22.113
but losing your soul.

20:23.510 --> 20:24.808
My faith has been challenged lately

20:24.810 --> 20:26.488
but what do you know of it?

20:26.490 --> 20:28.948
I know. I saw the woman.

20:28.950 --> 20:29.900
Who's that woman?

20:30.980 --> 20:33.068
Nevermind who that woman is.

20:33.070 --> 20:34.353
She's been taken care of.

20:36.670 --> 20:39.473
I see that she challenged
your faith though.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.288
Most certainly did.

20:43.290 --> 20:46.278
You're only half a
priest right now, Father.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.698
I try my best.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.398
After you still had your faith,

20:50.400 --> 20:52.083
the other half just doesn't know.

20:54.413 --> 20:56.443
How do you
know all this about me?

20:57.500 --> 20:59.808
I've been around a long time.

20:59.810 --> 21:01.310
I know a lot about everything.

21:02.240 --> 21:04.048
So what do you plan on doing about it?

21:04.050 --> 21:06.758
I'll admit my faith has been challenged

21:06.760 --> 21:08.058
but I'll do everything in my power

21:08.060 --> 21:09.708
to save as many as I can.

21:09.710 --> 21:11.178
Going to
that house is not gonna

21:11.180 --> 21:12.163
save your faith.

21:14.370 --> 21:16.558
You just wouldn't understand.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.810
You just wanna go there

21:18.670 --> 21:20.528
and watch people get jackrabbit fucked

21:20.530 --> 21:21.898
booty clapped, right?

21:21.900 --> 21:23.043
Slapping that flesh.

21:25.140 --> 21:27.588
That's what you're going
there for, all right.

21:27.590 --> 21:28.575
But guess what?

21:28.577 --> 21:30.328
You may not leave there alive

21:30.330 --> 21:32.148
with or without your soul,

21:32.150 --> 21:35.308
and I've been doing this
a long, long time, priest,

21:35.310 --> 21:37.114
and I've been real good at it.

21:39.030 --> 21:41.046
I'll do what I have to do.

21:41.048 --> 21:42.625
I appreciate your concern,

21:42.627 --> 21:44.477
but I will also do what must be done.

21:45.450 --> 21:46.900
You've been warned, Father.

22:09.813 --> 22:11.424
May the Lord be with you.

22:29.352 --> 22:30.269
Sandoval!

22:33.500 --> 22:34.333
Sandoval!

22:35.786 --> 22:37.318
Faith, what are you doing here?

22:37.320 --> 22:38.803
Ah, I'm going with you.

22:40.260 --> 22:41.710
Not on this one, I'm sorry.

22:42.660 --> 22:44.828
Oh my God, you trained me.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.048
You told me how to kill.

22:46.050 --> 22:47.788
You need me.

22:47.790 --> 22:49.618
And that's all well and good.

22:49.620 --> 22:52.208
But this demon is not like any other.

22:52.210 --> 22:55.118
He's an old demon, many tricks.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.388
You're not up to this

22:56.390 --> 22:58.225
and I don't want anything
to happen to you.

22:58.227 --> 22:59.618
And I can't do battle with him

22:59.620 --> 23:01.738
if I have to worry about you.

23:01.740 --> 23:03.168
I had a vision, Sandoval.

23:03.170 --> 23:05.208
I had a vision that you fucking died!

23:05.210 --> 23:06.728
So please take me with you!

23:06.730 --> 23:09.488
Listen to me, I'm not gonna die.

23:09.490 --> 23:10.328
I'll be fine.

23:10.330 --> 23:11.858
I'll be back.

23:11.860 --> 23:13.028
Your body is weak.

23:13.030 --> 23:14.583
Please, take me with you.

23:15.650 --> 23:17.900
My body wasn't too
weak last night, was it?

23:19.624 --> 23:20.455
Was it?

23:20.457 --> 23:23.778
Oh, I know it was actually
the best I've ever had,

23:23.780 --> 23:25.663
- and oh my God.
- Listen to me,

23:26.760 --> 23:29.101
all this time, working with you

23:29.103 --> 23:31.303
I just never realized
how beautiful you are.

23:32.273 --> 23:33.658
And I don't want anything
to happen to you.

23:33.660 --> 23:35.288
I couldn't stand it.

23:35.290 --> 23:36.543
So you're staying here.

23:37.564 --> 23:39.168
You promise me you'll be safe?

23:39.170 --> 23:40.603
Hey, Faith, have a little faith.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.988
Trust me.

23:43.990 --> 23:47.348
You go back to my place,
make yourself comfortable.

23:47.350 --> 23:50.578
And when I get back, I'll
tell you all the war stories.

23:50.580 --> 23:53.308
Here, take this with you.

23:53.310 --> 23:55.168
It's blessed.

23:55.170 --> 23:56.656
You're gonna need it.

23:56.658 --> 23:57.788
Even if I don't need
it, at least I'll have

23:57.790 --> 23:59.707
a piece of you with me.

24:01.586 --> 24:02.809
Stay safe, my love.

24:21.672 --> 24:23.325
What the fuck?

24:48.346 --> 24:50.076
This is nice.

26:02.954 --> 26:04.621
The time is close.

26:06.252 --> 26:07.730
This one's for you, preach.

26:17.150 --> 26:18.918
Sir, I'm a little lost.

26:18.920 --> 26:19.751
Can you help me find Draven's house.

26:19.753 --> 26:21.748
I'm looking for some girls.

26:21.750 --> 26:22.873
I wanna party.

26:23.750 --> 26:24.993
Draven's house.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.899
It's about a quarter mile up the road.

26:31.660 --> 26:33.668
Hey, you guys know where
this Draven's house is?

26:33.670 --> 26:35.488
There's supposed to be
a big party going on.

26:35.490 --> 26:37.018
I got my shirt in the car.

26:37.020 --> 26:37.878
- Draven's house.
- I'm ready to go.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.258
I've been driving up and down Malibu

26:39.260 --> 26:40.091
for like 10 minutes now.

26:40.093 --> 26:41.518
I can't find this place.

26:41.520 --> 26:43.148
Yeah, it's about a
quarter mile up the road.

26:43.150 --> 26:44.398
This kid's looking for the same place.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.028
Maybe you wanna take him with you?

26:46.030 --> 26:46.861
Oh, yeah?

26:46.863 --> 26:47.925
All right. How old are you kid?

26:47.927 --> 26:49.498
I'm 21. I'm old enough.

26:49.500 --> 26:52.068
21. All right.

26:52.070 --> 26:53.028
Okay, all right.

26:53.030 --> 26:54.189
Hey, thanks a lot, man. I appreciate it

26:54.191 --> 26:55.671
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

26:55.673 --> 26:57.843
Yeah, all right, well,
I'll see you around.

26:57.845 --> 26:59.869
Come on kid, let's go
get some pussy, yeah.

27:14.284 --> 27:16.398
Wow, this place is killer, yo.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.050
That's right, kid.

27:18.052 --> 27:19.119
You know, so lead me to the pussy.

27:19.121 --> 27:21.221
Yeah, I heard they got
really good pussy here.

27:21.223 --> 27:22.315
You're gonna get laid tonight.

27:22.317 --> 27:24.193
Yeah, and you too, bro.

27:24.195 --> 27:25.866
Let's go get a drink,

27:25.868 --> 27:28.038
introduce ourselves to the young ladies.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.095
- Hell yeah.
- Get you some piece of ass.

27:30.097 --> 27:31.294
I'm ready, my dick is getting harder

27:31.296 --> 27:32.485
- from just...
- No, I don't wanna

27:32.487 --> 27:34.453
know about that.

27:54.544 --> 27:56.714
Ladies, LT in the building.

28:11.526 --> 28:12.684
Come on, Maldito.

28:12.686 --> 28:14.025
Let's go get some putas.

28:14.027 --> 28:15.358
Hold on.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.693
Puta, waa, yeah!

28:18.508 --> 28:19.339
Wooh!

28:29.027 --> 28:31.332
What are you doing here, Father?

28:31.334 --> 28:33.312
I'm here to save souls.

28:33.314 --> 28:35.718
More like looking to fill some holes.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.828
Get out of here before it's too late.

28:37.830 --> 28:40.137
Excuse me, but I have
something to do now.

28:43.715 --> 28:45.691
Yo, this party is awesome!

28:45.693 --> 28:47.088
These girls are hot!

28:47.090 --> 28:48.273
Let's get some pussy!

28:49.820 --> 28:52.818
Wait, you're a priest.

28:52.820 --> 28:54.148
- Yes I am.
- What the fuck

28:54.150 --> 28:55.825
are you doing here?

28:55.827 --> 28:57.628
I'm here to save souls,

28:57.630 --> 28:59.777
just like I told him.

28:59.779 --> 29:02.498
You're a priest and
you're here to save souls?

29:02.500 --> 29:04.053
Yes, sir.

29:04.055 --> 29:05.474
Hmm.

29:09.669 --> 29:10.875
That's cool.

29:13.434 --> 29:14.954
This puta from.

29:18.475 --> 29:20.377
Shalom, my brother.

29:24.407 --> 29:25.945
Get out of here. I'm Jewish.

29:25.947 --> 29:26.778
Oh, no, really?

29:26.780 --> 29:28.784
It's like a bad joke, man.

29:28.786 --> 29:30.068
All right, so are you ready for this?

29:30.070 --> 29:31.668
- I'm ready. Yeah man.
- A couple of drinks,

29:31.670 --> 29:33.288
calm yourself down,

29:33.290 --> 29:34.988
get these girls up here, get you all set.

29:34.990 --> 29:36.688
I heard these girls are really high class.

29:36.690 --> 29:38.348
- I'm ready for mad pussy.
- You're gonna do all right,

29:38.350 --> 29:39.181
don't worry about it.

29:39.183 --> 29:40.678
Just follow me around all night,

29:40.680 --> 29:41.691
I'll take care of you.

29:41.693 --> 29:45.308
Pussy, man, I
came all the way from Mexico.

29:45.310 --> 29:47.237
Yeah, I know, later on, later on.

29:47.239 --> 29:49.038
You never told me to jerk off.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.388
Yeah, later on.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.007
Do you see the guy with the clown mask?

29:53.009 --> 29:55.644
What the hell is going on here, man?

29:55.646 --> 29:57.218
- This is getting ridiculous.
- Hey, you got, look it,

29:57.220 --> 29:59.424
this guy, he's a clown that comes here.

30:04.627 --> 30:06.270
Yeah, this is gonna be my first time.

30:06.272 --> 30:07.878
- Gonna be your first time?
- It's my first time.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.486
Yeah, you got more than $20 on you?

30:09.488 --> 30:10.319
- Oh, yeah.
- 'Cause this is a little bit

30:10.321 --> 30:11.235
- more than on the street.
- Really?

30:11.237 --> 30:13.573
- This is a high class place.
- Awesome.

30:14.800 --> 30:18.480
Welcome, gentlemen

30:18.482 --> 30:21.488
to Draven's Ravenwood Resort

30:21.490 --> 30:24.080
where all of your common desires

30:25.490 --> 30:28.522
are sure to be met this evening.

30:28.524 --> 30:31.607
And here on the side is my Ravenettes

30:33.600 --> 30:36.263
who'll be taking care of
you quite well later on.

30:37.590 --> 30:38.978
And over here,

30:38.980 --> 30:42.138
is my lovely, lovely wife,

30:42.140 --> 30:44.072
- who I'm sad to say
- Hi, guys.

30:44.074 --> 30:47.511
is not on the menu this evening.

30:49.541 --> 30:50.589
- Bye, guys.
- But of course,

30:50.591 --> 30:51.867
here at Ravenwood,

30:51.869 --> 30:54.322
the money doesn't stop after all.

30:57.228 --> 31:00.655
On my left is the lovely, Tiffany.

31:00.657 --> 31:01.968
And believe me,

31:01.970 --> 31:04.508
if you have the good fortune

31:04.510 --> 31:06.778
of having breakfast with Tiffany,

31:06.780 --> 31:09.633
I'm sure you'll be back for lunch.

31:11.610 --> 31:16.610
On my right is the ravishing
Heidi from Heidelberg,

31:16.940 --> 31:20.638
and she brings all of that German goodness

31:20.640 --> 31:22.590
right here into this house.

31:23.730 --> 31:27.220
So ready your bratwursts
for a ravishing time.

31:30.362 --> 31:33.095
You look pretty.

31:33.097 --> 31:34.574
Come here, mamacita.

31:34.576 --> 31:36.717
Whoa, whoa, take your
hands off her, huh.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.117
Excuse me.

31:40.119 --> 31:41.427
What do you think that means to her

31:41.429 --> 31:43.032
when you talk to me like that?

31:43.034 --> 31:44.783
- This is the first time-
- Gonna outlaw you.

31:44.785 --> 31:45.616
Come on.

31:55.250 --> 31:56.878
I wanna do everything.

31:56.880 --> 32:01.580
A dirty sanchez and Cleveland
steamer, everything baby.

32:01.582 --> 32:02.415
Mm-hmm.

32:03.265 --> 32:04.098
Oh!

32:05.187 --> 32:06.020
Oh, shit.

32:07.073 --> 32:08.238
I think you got a spill on you.

32:08.240 --> 32:12.385
Oh yeah, I'm gonna be doing
a lot of spilling on you.

32:12.387 --> 32:14.738
If you pay enough.

32:14.740 --> 32:15.849
Wow.

32:15.851 --> 32:17.243
Come on drink, drink.

32:17.245 --> 32:19.194
Shut up and drink. Oh my God.

32:19.196 --> 32:20.658
I say we go have some fun.

32:20.660 --> 32:21.491
God.

32:24.871 --> 32:26.573
Wait till you see my place, baby.

32:26.575 --> 32:27.444
You're gonna love it.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.228
Your special place?

32:29.230 --> 32:31.098
- Oh, it's a special place.
- All right.

32:31.100 --> 32:32.828
- Take me there.
- What you came here for.

32:32.830 --> 32:34.248
- Take me there.
- All right, come on,

32:34.250 --> 32:36.551
- big boy.
- All right.

32:36.553 --> 32:37.869
- This is it?
- The entry.

32:37.871 --> 32:39.564
- This is your palace?
- Yes.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.379
- You wanna get started?
- Yeah,

32:41.381 --> 32:42.714
I bet you are.

32:45.028 --> 32:49.478
Oh, God, this is the best
blowjob I've ever gotten.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.418
Oh, man, I gotta come all the
way to Malibu to get this.

32:52.420 --> 32:54.648
I could never get this in New York.

32:54.650 --> 32:55.968
God.

32:55.970 --> 32:58.837
Oh, man. Suck that cannoli.

32:58.839 --> 33:00.678
Oh God.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.263
Tiffany?

33:03.780 --> 33:06.182
Oh sorry babe, I gotta go.

33:06.184 --> 33:08.338
Oh, where are you going?

33:08.340 --> 33:09.558
Maybe next time.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.530
- Right now, it's a no go.
- God!

33:13.890 --> 33:15.154
Shit, I'm coming, Daddy.

33:15.156 --> 33:16.566
I'm coming, Mr. Draven.

33:16.568 --> 33:17.485
Fuck. Fuck.

33:18.988 --> 33:23.338
Oh, man, this bitch had
to leave me like this?

33:23.340 --> 33:24.171
Fucking hanging.

33:24.173 --> 33:27.586
I got a fucking hard on the
size of the Verrazano Bridge.

33:52.800 --> 33:53.723
Oh, baby.

33:54.870 --> 33:57.088
Came back to finish me off, huh?

33:57.090 --> 33:57.923
Yeah.

33:59.020 --> 33:59.993
Oh, it feels good.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.078
Oh, yeah.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.468
Wait, you're getting a little rough there.

34:03.470 --> 34:04.613
Don't you think?

34:06.250 --> 34:07.638
Wait a minute. Hey.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.942
What, what, what, what, what the fuck!

34:10.944 --> 34:12.141
Ow!

34:12.143 --> 34:13.045
Fuck!

34:15.139 --> 34:20.139
My fucking dick!

34:38.293 --> 34:40.369
Hey, darling.

34:40.371 --> 34:42.621
Ooh, that's a Ravenette.

34:45.739 --> 34:47.440
Looks like Christmas came early.

34:49.110 --> 34:52.433
Yeah, I've got a package for you, dear.

34:52.435 --> 34:53.685
I bet you do.

35:10.068 --> 35:11.068
You are hot.

35:19.717 --> 35:20.550
Oh, raven.

35:48.029 --> 35:49.080
Yes.

35:51.522 --> 35:52.855
My little raven.

36:05.345 --> 36:06.922
Why so quick though?

36:06.924 --> 36:08.808
You know I love it.

36:08.810 --> 36:10.925
Are you just teasing me?

36:10.927 --> 36:12.807
You know, I'm just saving
me some more time for later.

36:15.607 --> 36:16.438
Okay.

36:18.196 --> 36:21.466
You better promise, though.

36:24.608 --> 36:26.487
- Hi, there.
- Hey, holy roller.

36:26.489 --> 36:27.660
Hello ladies.

36:27.662 --> 36:28.700
He's a holy roller.

36:28.702 --> 36:29.805
- Here we go.
- Come on.

36:29.807 --> 36:31.610
- Come on, go.
- Hello, ladies.

36:31.612 --> 36:33.233
- What's up, holy roller?
- Hello, ladies.

36:33.235 --> 36:34.351
- How are ya?
- Thank you for-

36:34.353 --> 36:35.535
- You have no money?
- Jesus!

36:35.537 --> 36:36.522
- Well I got money.
- Anything?

36:36.524 --> 36:38.074
Oh, here we go.

36:38.921 --> 36:41.012
Where's all that money you
stole from the congregation?

36:41.014 --> 36:41.845
- Yeah.
- Well,

36:41.847 --> 36:43.488
I don't steal from my congregation.

36:43.490 --> 36:44.854
- Oh no, it's hot.
- They're my flock.

36:44.856 --> 36:45.997
No, it's hot.

36:45.999 --> 36:46.843
- Well maybe I did.
- They're his flock.

36:46.845 --> 36:48.926
And maybe it was all my idea.

36:48.928 --> 36:50.381
Would you like to join my flock?

36:50.383 --> 36:51.838
I would love to join your flock.

36:51.840 --> 36:52.699
Would you like to join my flock?

36:52.701 --> 36:53.874
- What's your budget?
- Join his flock?

36:53.876 --> 36:54.831
- What's my budget?
- Yeah.

36:54.833 --> 36:55.983
What's your budget?

36:55.985 --> 36:57.471
- What's my budget?
- Well, it's pretty high.

37:00.084 --> 37:01.414
You can't afford this.

37:01.416 --> 37:02.977
- Well the Lord,
- Guess you're not

37:02.979 --> 37:04.385
- joining the fun.
- The Lord knows the way.

37:04.387 --> 37:06.138
And I follow the lord.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.493
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

37:07.495 --> 37:10.378
Do you think the heavens will allow us

37:10.380 --> 37:12.132
to go up and party?

37:12.134 --> 37:13.078
- Um...
- Maybe?

37:13.080 --> 37:14.928
I think we should, we should find out.

37:14.930 --> 37:16.868
Yeah, I think we should find out too.

37:16.870 --> 37:18.848
- Come on, let's go.
- Do you wanna go to heaven?

37:18.850 --> 37:20.169
We're all going to heaven.

37:20.171 --> 37:21.181
You know, I could get you to heaven.

37:21.183 --> 37:23.309
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

37:25.256 --> 37:28.105
Finally.

37:28.107 --> 37:30.414
The Lord knows I needed that.

37:34.602 --> 37:37.605
God, that was some good pussy.

37:37.607 --> 37:39.208
How do I look, God?

37:58.460 --> 38:02.768
Heidi, the most favorite of my ravens.

38:02.770 --> 38:07.770
Huh, you have always been the
toughest little egg to crack

38:08.738 --> 38:11.309
Because we don't mix
business with pleasure.

38:13.410 --> 38:17.172
There's going to be no business involved.

38:17.174 --> 38:18.782
Haven't you had enough for tonight?

38:18.784 --> 38:22.488
Enough?

38:22.490 --> 38:24.478
I can go all night.

38:24.480 --> 38:29.098
Now, how about doing a little
dance like you used to do

38:29.100 --> 38:33.848
for me before I gave you this job?

38:33.850 --> 38:34.681
Eat me.

38:34.683 --> 38:36.588
I don't do that anymore.

38:36.590 --> 38:37.673
Just do it!

38:40.260 --> 38:41.273
Just do it.

38:53.968 --> 38:54.801
That's it.

38:56.660 --> 38:57.493
That's it.

39:00.381 --> 39:01.214
Mm.

39:02.902 --> 39:05.117
Come on, that's better, Raven.

39:07.237 --> 39:08.070
Oh.

39:17.511 --> 39:19.846
Oh, this is so fucking hot!

39:19.848 --> 39:21.026
Out of your fucking mind?

39:21.028 --> 39:23.388
Get out of my room!

39:39.824 --> 39:42.907
Not supposed to be sitting around.

39:44.094 --> 39:45.258
I don't know who sent you,

39:45.260 --> 39:49.213
come into my house to enjoy my women,

39:50.630 --> 39:52.983
but you don't spend any money.

39:53.832 --> 39:54.665
Do you?

39:55.950 --> 40:00.950
Mr. Draven, you have
a very receptive mind.

40:02.180 --> 40:03.013
Hmm.

40:04.810 --> 40:08.843
The fact that I'm kind
of ordained to be here.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.220
Kind of like the priest in the corner.

40:14.470 --> 40:15.613
I'm here on a mission.

40:17.940 --> 40:21.544
A long, long time mission.

40:21.546 --> 40:23.840
- A mission, you say?
- Mm-hmm.

40:25.520 --> 40:29.553
You see, you can appreciate this.

40:30.450 --> 40:31.283
I'm a hunter.

40:32.220 --> 40:33.051
Mm-hmm.

40:33.053 --> 40:36.355
And my prey is in your midst.

40:36.357 --> 40:37.190
Ah.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.548
In my midst, aye?

40:41.550 --> 40:44.223
And what is it, Mr.
Sandoval, that you hunt?

40:45.700 --> 40:47.283
I hunt demons.

40:48.980 --> 40:53.623
In fact, I was set to
hunt one particular demon,

40:55.114 --> 40:57.763
a nun, but much to my chagrin,

41:01.800 --> 41:06.188
I come to find that there
are two demons here.

41:06.190 --> 41:08.068
Oh, is that correct?

41:08.070 --> 41:11.148
So I can basically kill two

41:11.150 --> 41:12.778
with one stone, so to speak.

41:12.780 --> 41:15.494
Well, that would
explain why you came here.

41:15.496 --> 41:16.329
Yes.

41:18.060 --> 41:21.353
And as for my future,

41:22.740 --> 41:24.593
I don't care how it ends up for me.

41:25.552 --> 41:27.563
My job will be accomplished.

41:28.870 --> 41:33.870
120 years, I've been
doing this, Mr. Draven.

41:33.910 --> 41:35.648
I've gotten quite good at.

41:35.650 --> 41:37.388
I see.

41:37.390 --> 41:39.218
120 years, Mr. Sandoval,

41:39.220 --> 41:43.083
and apparently you're not
very good at, are you?

41:44.705 --> 41:46.758
And how so?

41:46.760 --> 41:48.558
Well, it's taking you all this time

41:48.560 --> 41:50.713
to locate your demons.

41:52.730 --> 41:54.751
But yet they still walk the earth.

41:54.753 --> 41:56.888
- That is true.
- Hmm.

41:56.890 --> 41:58.790
Imagine my surprise

42:00.030 --> 42:03.843
when the person hosting the demon,

42:05.022 --> 42:07.275
is a demon himself.

42:13.610 --> 42:14.997
Mr, Sandoval,

42:16.360 --> 42:21.360
you accuse me of being one of your demons?

42:22.630 --> 42:25.063
I am not accusing you, Mr. Draven.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.963
I am telling you fact.

42:29.275 --> 42:32.644
And I'm looking at you straight
in the eye as I say it.

42:32.646 --> 42:34.346
And I gotta say, here's the thing.

42:35.690 --> 42:37.893
Whether I make it out
of here alive or not,

42:39.006 --> 42:41.735
I have this safe bet before
I entered these premises.

42:41.737 --> 42:42.758
Mm.

42:42.760 --> 42:47.078
The difference is when the
end comes, I go up there,

42:47.080 --> 42:48.363
you go nowhere.

42:49.530 --> 42:53.457
No, Mr. Sandoval.

42:54.790 --> 42:58.448
You have quite an outlook
on what's going on here

42:58.450 --> 43:01.840
and yet I find you so full of shit.

43:03.489 --> 43:07.928
Well, say what you want but in the end,

43:07.930 --> 43:09.643
shit rolls downhill, pal.

43:17.534 --> 43:18.365
10 favorite horror movies.

43:18.367 --> 43:19.624
I mean, I just hate horror movies

43:19.626 --> 43:20.708
- "Scream"
- because the black guy

43:20.710 --> 43:22.178
always dies I the end.

43:22.180 --> 43:23.611
- That's true, man.
- That is true.

43:23.613 --> 43:24.757
They're always the first one to go.

43:24.759 --> 43:26.275
That's true, I never
even thought about that,

43:26.277 --> 43:27.218
but you're right.

43:27.220 --> 43:28.725
What are you
still doing here, holmes?

43:31.525 --> 43:32.708
You know what I mean?

43:32.710 --> 43:34.046
It's either the black guy

43:34.048 --> 43:35.569
or the guy in the
wheelchair that always dies.

43:35.571 --> 43:36.958
- Oh, God.
- Oh, man.

43:36.960 --> 43:38.627
I like the chupacabra movie.

43:38.629 --> 43:40.548
- Chupacabra?
- Chupacabra?

43:40.550 --> 43:41.998
Where are you, man?

43:42.000 --> 43:42.833
Mexico.

43:44.129 --> 43:46.888
No, we're in the United, oh my God!

43:46.890 --> 43:48.469
Mr. Cool has left the room.

43:48.471 --> 43:50.183
That sounds like a good scary movie.

43:50.185 --> 43:51.185
Oh, yeah.

43:53.030 --> 43:54.655
Well, I'm glad to see my guests

43:54.657 --> 43:56.193
all enjoying themselves.

43:57.358 --> 44:02.097
It's a wonderful night for
scary stories, isn't it?

44:03.239 --> 44:07.613
But if you want to know what scares me,

44:09.140 --> 44:11.588
I would have to go back to my childhood,

44:11.590 --> 44:15.233
when out for a drive with my family.

44:16.740 --> 44:20.018
The car skidded off the road,

44:20.020 --> 44:22.048
turned over,

44:22.050 --> 44:25.738
and I was ejected into weeds.

44:25.740 --> 44:29.278
I had to lay there and
listen to my father,

44:29.280 --> 44:33.035
who was trapped behind the steering wheel,

44:33.037 --> 44:35.188
screaming my name.

44:35.190 --> 44:38.328
I was the only one there who could help.

44:38.330 --> 44:41.930
And yet, I was frozen with fear.

44:44.070 --> 44:47.408
And while I lay there frozen in fear,

44:47.410 --> 44:48.770
I had to watch my...

44:51.219 --> 44:54.248
They burst into flames.

44:54.250 --> 44:59.250
My poor mother's face
melting in the window.

45:01.780 --> 45:03.128
As my father screamed for help,

45:03.130 --> 45:05.018
I was the only one who
could open the door,

45:05.020 --> 45:06.750
but I could not move.

45:07.670 --> 45:12.013
My friends, if you want to know fear,

45:13.257 --> 45:17.066
experience immobilization.

45:19.590 --> 45:22.188
That, my friends, is fear,

45:22.190 --> 45:25.718
when you cannot do anything about

45:25.720 --> 45:27.950
what is causing your fear.

45:32.530 --> 45:34.903
But here I stand today,

45:36.190 --> 45:37.340
I've gotten through it.

45:38.940 --> 45:39.973
Unlike my family.

45:42.890 --> 45:46.053
The only good I can see
that's come from that, though,

45:47.180 --> 45:49.190
is that I never took up smoking.

45:52.090 --> 45:55.083
Well that, Mr. Draven,
is a riveting story.

46:01.570 --> 46:03.167
Better than a chupacabra.

46:03.169 --> 46:04.169
- Mm.
- Yes.

46:05.124 --> 46:06.541
Enjoy yourselves.

46:08.290 --> 46:09.293
- Have a good time.
- Mm, we will.

46:27.460 --> 46:30.558
Oh, check out this cool
new pimpin' shirt on me.

46:30.560 --> 46:32.443
It looks swazy, yo.

46:34.800 --> 46:36.893
The hell with them. Here's us.

46:38.320 --> 46:39.223
I'll drink to that one.

46:39.225 --> 46:41.457
All right.

46:42.342 --> 46:44.212
Hey look, look, I'm
a pro football player.

46:44.214 --> 46:45.208
Mm, okay.

46:45.210 --> 46:47.593
So, I say we go have some fun.

46:48.428 --> 46:50.829
Well take me to your field, big guy.

46:52.010 --> 46:53.094
Let's go.

46:53.096 --> 46:54.431
That sounds good to me.

47:00.113 --> 47:02.052
What the fuck?

47:02.054 --> 47:03.327
What the...

47:03.329 --> 47:05.155
What the fuck is that?

47:05.157 --> 47:07.077
- What is that shit?
- Oh, my God.

47:07.079 --> 47:08.362
Ooh, oh my God!

47:08.364 --> 47:09.195
It's alive!

47:12.687 --> 47:13.820
- Are you all right?
- Oh my God!

47:13.822 --> 47:15.557
Shit, oh my God!

47:16.872 --> 47:21.146
What the fuck?

47:21.148 --> 47:22.085
- I don't know.
- Come on,

47:22.087 --> 47:23.604
let's see what's going on.

47:23.606 --> 47:24.607
I'll protect you.

47:29.887 --> 47:32.029
We will always have our history.

47:32.031 --> 47:33.116
- Okay.
- Okay, man?

47:33.118 --> 47:34.439
- Okay.
- Let's kick their ass.

47:34.441 --> 47:36.728
Yeah. All right.

47:36.730 --> 47:37.759
I'll check it out.

47:43.509 --> 47:45.676
What the hell is going on?

48:27.797 --> 48:28.630
Oh no.

49:11.321 --> 49:13.433
I'm pissed. I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

49:13.435 --> 49:14.707
Fuck.

49:20.582 --> 49:22.731
Oh, Jesus Christ.

49:22.733 --> 49:23.566
Fuck.

49:25.287 --> 49:26.120
Uh!

49:28.948 --> 49:29.890
Guys!

49:35.403 --> 49:36.236
Oh, yes.

49:39.050 --> 49:40.280
Oh, shit!

50:03.134 --> 50:04.112
- What the fuck?
- Oh my God,

50:04.114 --> 50:05.154
what the fuck is...

50:05.156 --> 50:06.927
- It's a severed drain.
- Oh, shit.

50:06.929 --> 50:08.250
What the fuck, man?

50:09.613 --> 50:12.447
There will be no police.

50:14.010 --> 50:15.923
And no one will leave.

50:18.965 --> 50:23.048
And if you
would all be so kind

50:23.050 --> 50:26.410
to put your cell phones over
there on the table, now.

50:28.090 --> 50:29.257
He's got a gun!

50:30.250 --> 50:31.613
Yo man, put the gun down.

50:33.140 --> 50:35.083
You better be ready to
know how to use that thing.

50:35.085 --> 50:39.563
I can
assure you, Mr. Sandoval,

50:40.530 --> 50:41.373
I do.

50:42.520 --> 50:44.270
Yo man, put the fucking gun down.

50:45.606 --> 50:47.068
Uh.

50:47.070 --> 50:50.860
Would you like to play
cock of the walk with me

50:52.342 --> 50:53.357
Hmm?

50:53.359 --> 50:55.942
Would you like to play, chucko?

50:57.305 --> 51:01.388
Well do you, chucko?

51:02.669 --> 51:03.500
No.

51:03.502 --> 51:07.748
I didn't think so,

51:07.750 --> 51:09.960
because we all know now

51:11.538 --> 51:16.278
that I've got the
biggest cock in the room.

51:16.280 --> 51:18.660
And this is my room.

51:20.458 --> 51:24.798
And this is my house!

51:24.800 --> 51:27.920
And I will decide how to
deal with this problem.

51:28.834 --> 51:33.834
And I won't hesitate for a
moment to put a bullet in anyone

51:34.850 --> 51:39.228
who interferes with my girls or my home.

51:39.230 --> 51:41.328
We're all neck deep in Shit's Creek here

51:41.330 --> 51:42.630
with our mouths wide open.

51:43.500 --> 51:45.703
Well then learn to
tread water, my friend.

51:48.360 --> 51:49.868
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

51:49.870 --> 51:50.813
- Oh my God!
- What is it?

51:50.815 --> 51:52.215
- Oh my God!
- I'm getting

51:52.217 --> 51:54.438
the fuck out of here!

51:54.440 --> 51:55.890
Oh my God, what is that?

51:57.620 --> 51:59.818
I need help, I need to do something!

51:59.820 --> 52:02.120
I need help, I need to
do something right now.

52:15.117 --> 52:16.968
Where's my fucking girl, ugly?

52:16.970 --> 52:18.264
- I got something.
- I don't give a shit.

52:18.266 --> 52:20.018
You're a priest, man. Motherfucker.

52:21.738 --> 52:23.657
I thought the black guy
was supposed to live?

52:44.504 --> 52:46.146
Mr. Draven!

52:46.148 --> 52:49.148
Father, you will be going nowhere.

52:51.091 --> 52:52.648
I didn't do anything to deserve this.

52:52.650 --> 52:57.650
No, you've done plenty
to deserve this, my friend.

52:57.726 --> 53:01.678
You come to my place
and you've defiled this.

53:04.190 --> 53:05.156
The power of God.

53:06.290 --> 53:08.222
The power of God compels you.

53:08.224 --> 53:10.773
- You have little faith
- The power...

53:10.775 --> 53:13.738
in God.

53:13.740 --> 53:14.831
Hey, assholes!

53:20.184 --> 53:21.601
You puny woman.

53:22.963 --> 53:25.988
You come here to destroy

53:25.990 --> 53:27.478
what we have created,

53:27.480 --> 53:29.099
which is a machine!

53:29.101 --> 53:32.237
You've been blind to
fresh flesh and souls.

53:33.703 --> 53:36.450
That gun will do nothing.

53:36.452 --> 53:38.365
We will destroy you!

53:39.200 --> 53:40.975
I got a one silver bullet in here

53:40.977 --> 53:42.630
and it's got your name on it.

53:58.910 --> 54:00.557
Shoot her! Shoot her!

54:05.743 --> 54:07.161
I got this.

54:07.163 --> 54:08.713
I can only hold it off so long.

54:09.742 --> 54:12.378
This is our chance to get out of here.

54:12.380 --> 54:13.688
Ready to go?

54:13.690 --> 54:15.011
- I'm ready.
- Let's go, kid.

54:22.830 --> 54:24.458
She doesn't want me to leave, kid.

54:24.460 --> 54:26.108
You're free to go.

54:26.110 --> 54:28.918
No, I told you, I'm here to save souls.

54:28.920 --> 54:30.653
This is my battle, not yours.

54:32.600 --> 54:34.038
Boy, you better step up your game

54:34.040 --> 54:36.828
because you don't know
what you're dealing with.

54:36.830 --> 54:38.180
I'm ready for this bitch.

54:43.830 --> 54:45.332
This has gotta stop.

54:45.334 --> 54:50.199
This has to work.

54:50.201 --> 54:51.201
Bloody Mary.

54:52.593 --> 54:53.593
Bloody Mary.

54:55.095 --> 54:56.095
Bloody Mary.

55:17.723 --> 55:19.328
Here, kid.

55:19.330 --> 55:22.178
This is the only thing
that's gonna kill her.

55:22.180 --> 55:23.058
Now I've been around a while,

55:23.060 --> 55:24.977
my body's getting weak.

55:24.979 --> 55:27.458
I don't think I can do this much longer.

55:27.460 --> 55:29.998
This is where we have to make a stand.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.598
Our only shot is to get out of here

55:31.600 --> 55:34.138
by killing her or die trying.

55:34.140 --> 55:35.290
And we may not make it.

55:36.141 --> 55:37.313
Are you up for this?

55:41.360 --> 55:42.615
I'm ready.

55:42.617 --> 55:44.258
I hope so.

55:44.260 --> 55:45.370
Let's do this.

55:52.111 --> 55:53.133
Get back, demon!

55:59.253 --> 56:01.178
It's not looking good, man.

56:01.180 --> 56:03.008
- Look-
- I need you though.

56:03.010 --> 56:05.057
You gotta take this knife out of me.

56:05.955 --> 56:07.048
I can't do that.

56:07.050 --> 56:07.903
You have to.

56:09.120 --> 56:10.103
Use your faith.

56:11.380 --> 56:12.673
Battle this bitch.

56:14.820 --> 56:17.218
You're the only one that can do it now.

56:17.220 --> 56:19.218
I'm too old, weak.

56:19.220 --> 56:20.698
I'm mortally wounded here.

56:20.700 --> 56:21.800
I'm not gonna make it.

56:22.720 --> 56:23.753
My time is done.

56:24.680 --> 56:26.313
I'm passing it off to you.

56:28.230 --> 56:30.288
Pull the knife out.

56:30.290 --> 56:31.123
Use your faith.

56:32.187 --> 56:33.543
Battle this bitch.

56:34.920 --> 56:37.038
Take the knife and do it.

56:37.040 --> 56:37.873
You ready?

56:39.303 --> 56:40.246
Ready.

56:40.248 --> 56:42.119
I'm gonna make you proud.

56:47.690 --> 56:49.408
May the Lord be with you.

57:14.195 --> 57:15.640
Let's go, bitch.

57:25.903 --> 57:27.875
Let's see if she's gonna
wanna suck on this.

57:29.594 --> 57:30.738
I can do this.

57:30.740 --> 57:33.603
Demon, proud demon,

57:35.520 --> 57:36.942
show yourself.

57:45.211 --> 57:50.211
Don't hide.

57:57.307 --> 57:58.708
Oh, shit.

58:26.670 --> 58:28.363
I know you're in there, demon.

58:32.310 --> 58:33.609
Demon?

58:33.611 --> 58:34.564
Come on, demon.

58:41.270 --> 58:42.493
Show yourself.

58:58.200 --> 59:00.271
Oh, so you wanna play?

59:03.170 --> 59:04.820
Yeah, why don't you suck on this?

59:14.570 --> 59:16.094
What the freak!

59:20.231 --> 59:22.648
Bitch, I know you ain't dead.

59:54.471 --> 59:56.647
This is how you fucking save a soul.

01:00:21.135 --> 01:00:21.968
Dean?

01:00:23.571 --> 01:00:24.845
Baby?

01:00:24.847 --> 01:00:25.680
Dean?

01:00:27.515 --> 01:00:29.018
Dean?

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:29.853
Dean?

01:00:30.968 --> 01:00:32.065
Dean?

01:00:32.067 --> 01:00:33.067
Oh my, Dean?

01:00:34.372 --> 01:00:36.830
Oh, what happened to you, Dean?

01:00:36.832 --> 01:00:37.808
Dean?

01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:56.288
Hello everyone and
welcome to another edition

01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:59.028
of "Ella's Paranormal Investigations."

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.778
Now today, we will be
interviewing a gentleman

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:03.228
by the name of Hunk.

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:05.638
He survived the demon nun massacre,

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.323
and he wrote a book about it too.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:11.768
Some say he's making this entire thing up.

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:15.108
So naturally, I want you
to give him the opportunity

01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:17.078
to tell his side of the story

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.658
so we can find out the
truth once and for all.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:21.913
Let's go to the interview now.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:35.903
Hello Hunk, welcome to the show.

01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:39.703
My name is Hugh Edwards.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.683
I'm a journalist and author.

01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:45.523
My friends call me Hunk.

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:49.153
You're not my friend, Ella.

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:55.158
Okay. So let's get straight into this.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.548
I really, really wanted
to get you on the show

01:01:58.550 --> 01:02:01.638
so that you could basically
tell your side of the story.

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.538
So many people have just completely

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.458
debunked your side of things.

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.063
And basically Cluster was insane.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.508
Insane?

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:13.583
Insane?

01:02:14.930 --> 01:02:17.758
How can I be insane when I saw that demon

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.173
and battled it with my own eyes and body.

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:26.988
That thing, put a hook, a
meat hook through my shoulder.

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:29.940
I had a battle with that thing
and you're calling me crazy?

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:36.183
Okay.

01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:39.328
Don't get aggressive with me, mate.

01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:41.333
I will end this interview if I have to.

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:50.190
I'm sorry, but in order
for you to listen to me

01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:52.448
and really understand me,

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:55.088
I have to tell you and show you

01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:56.793
what I went through in that cabin.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:05.798
Yes, but there is no evidence
supporting your claims.

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.788
Not one body found.

01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:09.718
No nun, no dead vloggers,

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.013
no millionaire.

01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:14.688
Yeah, it's strange that
Paranormal Tim and the Ghost Boys

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:16.378
went missing after your claims,

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:19.213
but still nothing to support your story.

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:22.958
People leave social media
and their video vlogs

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:23.933
all the time.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:27.640
No supporting evidence.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.268
Is that in your question, Ella?

01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:32.351
Well Let me tell you something.

01:03:32.353 --> 01:03:37.353
Paranormal Tim got a hook
right through his crotch.

01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:39.028
I saw it.

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:44.030
I was there. The Ghost Boys,
they turned into fucking demons

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:50.128
and unfortunately I had to
kill them with a hammer.

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:51.563
I'd crack their skulls open,

01:03:53.383 --> 01:03:54.973
and well, Shiva,

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.703
that guy's responsible
for the whole thing.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:02.050
He had some kind of amulet

01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:06.620
that controlled the nun

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.623
and summoned this thing from hell.

01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:13.123
That thing tried to
kill me and my friends.

01:04:16.290 --> 01:04:17.213
Hmm, okay.

01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:23.178
So you were also tied to Becky E. right?

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:26.218
Another paranormal
investigator like myself.

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:28.578
She has also been off the grid.

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.430
Hunk, do you know if her whereabouts?

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:33.628
No, I don't know the whereabouts

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:36.278
of my girlfriend, Becky E.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.908
Yes, YouTube blogger, Becky E.

01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:43.658
She had the amulet and
something happened to her.

01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:48.133
It changed her, her and Rico.

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:52.583
Do you mean Rico Vega?

01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:56.278
The drug addict who was
making up fake hauntings

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:57.430
to take people's money?

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.953
Yeah, it's Rico Vega.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:06.028
He's my friend, Rico.

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:06.898
He's a good guy.

01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:08.778
I used to think the same thing about him,

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:13.033
but the man saved my life that night.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.293
So I would do anything to save his.

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:19.603
Listen.

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:22.263
Becky.

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:25.918
Please baby, if you're out there,

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.783
listen to me.

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.563
You know I love you and I miss you.

01:05:31.984 --> 01:05:33.843
And I will find you.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.238
If anybody in your audience

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.753
or anybody has any
information about Becky,

01:05:41.810 --> 01:05:43.263
you know how to contact me.

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:50.838
Well, I think we all know
about Becky's troubled history

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:54.058
and making up some videos
with her buddy, Rico.

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:59.060
But I really want to focus on you, Hunk.

01:05:59.150 --> 01:06:00.658
I want to believe your story.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.568
And I think our viewers will agree

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:05.613
that it is such a good story.

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:10.038
You said you were Becky's
cameraman that night.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:13.373
So why don't you have any
video footage of what happened?

01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:19.770
Well you know, that's
actually where you're wrong.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.043
I do have footage to show
you and your audience.

01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:28.640
You wanna know about the nun?

01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:32.266
I'll show you.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.113
Oh.

01:06:35.494 --> 01:06:36.863
Okay.

01:07:08.597 --> 01:07:11.037
Hunk, can you please stop the video?

01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:28.068
Hunk, can you please stop the video?

01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:29.164
I can't watch anymore.

01:07:29.166 --> 01:07:31.413
And we're also live.

01:07:53.359 --> 01:07:55.359
The bloody nun is real.

01:07:57.797 --> 01:07:58.628
I told you.

01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:00.040
I told you all

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:03.888
the nun is still out there.

01:08:03.890 --> 01:08:06.778
Becky, I love you, baby.

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.893
I'm coming to get you.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:12.753
But you all have to listen me now.

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:17.258
The nun is still out there!

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:22.260
I thought I destroyed it,
but she is still out there!

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:32.933
The nun is back.

01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:38.314
I'm coming for you.
