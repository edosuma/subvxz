WEBVTT

00:03.604 --> 00:04.603
Anna.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.388
Arkady's alive.

00:06.389 --> 00:08.172
In nazarovo prison in russia.
Yes.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.241
I need to get him out of there.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.542
I'll help you.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.378
The man being held
with arkady is cia.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.079
Randall sharov.

00:14.081 --> 00:15.047
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

00:15.049 --> 00:16.615
Who gave the refugees the coins?

00:16.617 --> 00:18.400
My father?

00:18.401 --> 00:20.184
Possibly.
He took meetings here.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.328
¶ we are, we are ¶

00:29.330 --> 00:34.066
¶ in-love enemies ¶

00:34.068 --> 00:36.035
¶ we are sentimental slaves ¶

00:36.037 --> 00:39.538
(laughter)
¶ on broken knees... ¶

00:42.810 --> 00:44.076
Uh-uh.

00:46.047 --> 00:46.812
Hah!
(laughing)

00:54.221 --> 00:55.421
<i> Nyet, nyet, nyet, nyet, nyet.</i>

01:00.461 --> 01:02.161
Aw...

01:04.732 --> 01:08.333
Well, you're lucky,
because I know gypsy magic.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.602
I can help you with that.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.179
Mm.
Ah.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.217
(laughter)

01:25.219 --> 01:26.485
And just like that,

01:26.487 --> 01:28.720
You are a free man.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.489
That is, uh, not a good trick.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.091
It's in your other hand.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.260
In here?
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.130
(all laughing)

01:47.374 --> 01:47.873
What...?

01:50.845 --> 01:52.377
(men chuckling)

01:54.148 --> 01:55.247
(men laughing)

01:58.152 --> 02:00.119
That was a good trick.

02:00.121 --> 02:03.422
Where is my
wedding ring?

02:03.424 --> 02:05.190
Guess you're gonna
have to look for it.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.258
Hmm...?

02:09.296 --> 02:10.596
You coming?

02:10.598 --> 02:13.398
(men chuckling)

02:13.400 --> 02:15.467
(indistinct conversations,
dance music playing)

02:23.210 --> 02:24.543
<i> Da.</i>

02:26.480 --> 02:28.213
(muttering in russian)

02:29.483 --> 02:31.550
Um...
Um...

02:35.890 --> 02:38.190
(both laughing)

02:38.192 --> 02:40.392
You are a tricky girl.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.529
If you only knew.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.599
(grunts)

02:50.371 --> 02:52.437
(engine starts)

02:55.676 --> 02:58.210
¶ ¶

03:15.963 --> 03:18.864
Hetty, have callen and sam

03:18.866 --> 03:20.365
Been able to get anything
from the guard?

03:20.367 --> 03:22.367
No, not yet.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.903
He's a pretty
defiant young man.

03:24.905 --> 03:27.506
But that should wear off
with the alcohol.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.641
Yeah, they can be
pretty persuasive.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.543
Well, we can be
wheels up in an hour.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.412
I think it would
take us no more than...

03:33.414 --> 03:36.215
But you're not going.
I'm sorry, what?

03:36.217 --> 03:38.784
So, just to clarify--
sam and callen

03:38.786 --> 03:40.285
Are gonna
go break arkady

03:40.287 --> 03:43.555
And a cia officer
out of a russian prison alone?

03:43.557 --> 03:46.291
I mean, you don't think
that's a little...

03:46.293 --> 03:47.726
(clears throat)

03:47.728 --> 03:49.895
(sighs nervously)

03:49.897 --> 03:51.563
Um...

03:51.565 --> 03:54.299
So have they appeared on
the russians' radar yet?

03:54.301 --> 03:56.468
I've talked with our friends

03:56.470 --> 03:58.337
In the other agencies.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.572
We seem to be clear
for the moment.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.608
How long do you think
that's gonna last?

04:02.610 --> 04:05.277
Two days, if we're lucky.

04:05.279 --> 04:07.379
Two hours if we're not.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.250
Callen:
Here's the deal, vladi:

04:11.252 --> 04:12.851
You tell us
what we need to know,

04:12.853 --> 04:16.288
You walk away, no one ever
knows you were here.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.723
But if you don't help us,

04:17.725 --> 04:19.558
We're gonna
make it look like you did,

04:19.560 --> 04:21.860
And leak that information.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.929
I'm not afraid of americans.

04:23.931 --> 04:27.266
You don't have to
be afraid of us.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.335
What do you think
your government will do

04:29.336 --> 04:31.403
If they even suspect you've
been spying for america?

04:31.405 --> 04:33.305
Once upon a time, you would've
been sent to the gulag.

04:33.307 --> 04:36.008
But today-- mm, not so lucky.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.279
Sam:
Where's arkady kolcheck?

04:40.281 --> 04:42.047
I don't even know who that is.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.516
I told you this wouldn't work.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.051
Let's throw him to the wolves.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.886
Last chance?

04:47.888 --> 04:49.421
(spits)

04:49.423 --> 04:52.357
Wow. Nice.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.560
We're getting nowhere.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.995
Put the classified e-mails
online and make sure

04:56.997 --> 04:59.364
Someone from gru sees them.

05:00.334 --> 05:02.401
Nice knowing you, comrade.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.836
What else do you want to know?

05:04.838 --> 05:06.905
Hold on.

05:08.776 --> 05:11.009
Where's arkady kolcheck?

05:11.011 --> 05:13.645
He's being held
at nazarovo prison,

05:13.647 --> 05:15.047
Where I work.

05:15.049 --> 05:17.749
But you know that.
Callen: Now...

05:17.751 --> 05:19.351
Where exactly?

05:19.353 --> 05:21.887
Cell block 24.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.523
What about balinski?

05:24.525 --> 05:27.025
Who?

05:27.027 --> 05:28.894
This man.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.429
Oh, I don't know.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.897
I've only been there
a couple months.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.765
I don't know everybody.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.667
Just in case you're thinking
about telling anyone

05:35.669 --> 05:39.371
About this conversation...

05:39.373 --> 05:42.941
Every single one
of these family members...

05:42.943 --> 05:45.344
Will find themselves...

05:45.346 --> 05:48.480
On the payroll for america's
foreign spy service.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.356
<i> Da.</i>

05:57.358 --> 05:58.490
<i> Da.</i>

06:08.669 --> 06:11.536
Looks like everything
worked out for you.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.105
Is he giving you
what you need?

06:13.107 --> 06:15.140
Well, remains to be seen.

06:15.142 --> 06:18.377
Well, I'll swing by later,
get rid of the van,

06:18.379 --> 06:19.728
Clean up any mess.

06:19.729 --> 06:21.078
Callen: Well, if everything
goes according to plan,

06:21.081 --> 06:22.547
We should be back
home in two days.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.916
You better move up
your timeline.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.719
Your arrival made some news
with the locals.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.621
It's gonna get hot for you.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.089
How long do we have?

06:31.091 --> 06:32.958
Tough to say.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.128
If it was my ass on the line,
I'd be gone in a day.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.671
What do we know
about cell block 24

06:46.673 --> 06:48.774
In nazarovo prison?

06:48.776 --> 06:51.543
Nazarovo prison--
cozy, imperial b and b

06:51.545 --> 06:53.645
That contains
mother russia's worst.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.614
And cell block 24
is reserved

06:55.616 --> 06:58.550
For her most notorious
no-goodniks.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.652
Now, this is
cell block 24,

07:00.654 --> 07:02.821
Which just
so happens to be

07:02.823 --> 07:05.157
One of the closest cells
to the duty officer's post.

07:05.159 --> 07:08.460
Unfortunately, vlad was unable
to confirm the presence

07:08.462 --> 07:10.495
Of cia officer sharov,

07:10.497 --> 07:11.897
Aka balinski.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.932
Eric:
So it still could be a trap.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.134
Well...
Maybe there
is no sharov.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.603
Or maybe the real
sharov is long dead

07:18.605 --> 07:20.939
And they're using
arkady to lure us into

07:20.941 --> 07:22.707
Rescuing a ghost.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.943
I mean, can you imagine the
political implications

07:24.945 --> 07:26.578
If two american agents
are caught

07:26.580 --> 07:28.447
Breaking into
a russian prison?

07:28.449 --> 07:30.949
Yes, I can.
This is a
well-fortified

07:30.951 --> 07:32.951
And protected
russian penitentiary.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.753
Breaking into it

07:34.755 --> 07:37.055
Is gonna put our team
at great risk.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.491
And even if they did
get in undetected,

07:39.493 --> 07:41.993
There's no guarantee
they could get back out.

07:41.995 --> 07:45.697
The only guarantee in life
is that one day it ends.

07:53.540 --> 07:57.042
And that's why his job at
hallmark didn't work out.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.612
What's the easiest way
into the prison?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.614
Murder.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.750
(sam laughs)

08:05.752 --> 08:08.553
Least he's still
got his sense of humor.

08:08.555 --> 08:11.056
What about
medical personnel?

08:11.058 --> 08:13.058
Prison doctor
is well-known by everyone--

08:13.060 --> 08:14.860
Guards and inmates alike.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.695
And what happens
when a prisoner dies?

08:16.697 --> 08:18.997
Get taken to city morgue.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.235
They're not gonna know
the coroner van drivers.

08:23.237 --> 08:26.872
It would help if we could
get the prison doctor on board.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.740
Money talks.

08:28.742 --> 08:32.277
Ol' vladi here could sneak
in some hydromorphone,

08:32.279 --> 08:33.712
Arkady and his buddy
could take enough

08:33.714 --> 08:35.247
To get 'em
to the brink of death.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.516
Doctors declare them dead,
we show up,

08:37.518 --> 08:39.551
Transport the bodies
over to the coroner's.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.887
Revive 'em en route
to the ratline.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.588
That could work.

08:43.590 --> 08:45.857
Vlad (snickering): Yeah,
you should try this plan.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.225
And I look forward

08:47.227 --> 08:48.760
To seeing you dead
in the city morgue,

08:48.762 --> 08:50.862
Or as inmates in my prison.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.014
¶ ¶

09:28.902 --> 09:31.870
(quiet whirring)

09:31.872 --> 09:34.339
Hello, anna.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.610
You're lucky I didn't shoot you.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.211
Had you done that,

09:40.213 --> 09:41.680
You would have received

09:41.682 --> 09:44.149
A rather large bill.

09:44.151 --> 09:47.018
Were you calling to order vodka

09:47.020 --> 09:48.720
And caviar to go?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.622
I was going to make
arrangements to get us

09:50.624 --> 09:52.991
Some equipment
to use while we're here.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.994
I've made certain to have
everything you would need

09:55.996 --> 09:57.329
Waiting for you.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.231
So where is it?

10:02.169 --> 10:04.703
Right this way, my dear.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.711
The stove on the right.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.784
(grunts)

10:19.786 --> 10:21.353
(laughs)

10:21.355 --> 10:24.356
You are a sneaky one.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.925
You don't know
the half of it, my dear.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.294
Hetty. Do tell.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.363
Good night, anna.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.367
Good night, hetty.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.673
What's the word?

10:41.675 --> 10:43.808
Anna is setting up operations

10:43.810 --> 10:46.211
In the apartment as we speak.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.113
Any progress with the guard?

10:48.115 --> 10:51.316
Well, callen and hanna
have a preliminary plan.

10:51.318 --> 10:54.019
Good.
Well, I don't know
how good it is.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.387
I should be
on the ground with them.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.255
Oh, no, I think they understand

10:57.257 --> 11:00.225
That you would be in russia
to support them if...

11:00.227 --> 11:02.761
Not to support them.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.295
Excuse me?

11:04.297 --> 11:07.699
I need your people to know
that if I tell them to abort,

11:07.701 --> 11:10.402
They'll do so
without hesitation.

11:10.404 --> 11:12.704
They're not in
california anymore.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.272
You know, owen,

11:14.274 --> 11:16.274
I-if I didn't know better,

11:16.276 --> 11:19.944
I would think
that you are worried.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.183
Anna.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.252
In here.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.356
You found the equipment.

11:31.358 --> 11:34.292
You didn't tell me hetty can
be in two places at once.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.295
Two's an understatement.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.097
There's food in the kitchen.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.333
I did that one already.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.437
(gun cocks)
doesn't like anyone touching
his weapon. So to speak.

11:45.439 --> 11:48.373
You gonna be able to get
the rest of the stuff we need?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.308
Yes, I already have somebody
working on the ambulance.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.843
The drug is easy.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.379
Well, let's hope
one of 'em isn't allergic.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.447
Any idea about your dad?

11:55.449 --> 11:57.982
Oh, you mean arkady?

11:57.984 --> 12:00.351
Yeah, calling him my dad
would be a stretch.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.021
He's more
of a business associate.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.323
Hm.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.425
All this for a...

12:07.427 --> 12:09.294
A business associate, huh?

12:09.296 --> 12:12.397
Look, if either one of them
has an allergic reaction

12:12.399 --> 12:15.266
To the hydromorphone, we need
to get them into the ambulance

12:15.268 --> 12:17.302
Fast enough to revive them.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.304
Can we count on vlad?

12:19.306 --> 12:20.905
We should be able to.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.374
All he has to do is get the
drugs into arkady and sharov

12:23.376 --> 12:25.910
And tell everyone he's called
an ambulance once they're out.

12:25.912 --> 12:29.013
The rest is up to us.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.448
What's our backup?

12:30.450 --> 12:31.516
We don't have one.

12:31.518 --> 12:34.419
Okay.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.421
What's our escape plan
if things go bad?

12:36.423 --> 12:37.989
Get the hell out of dodge.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.392
I thought you did this
for a living.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.261
Breaking into russian prisons?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.263
No, this is a...

12:45.265 --> 12:47.332
This is a first for us.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.469
Let's hope
you have a knack for it.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.043
What's wrong?

12:59.045 --> 13:00.912
Callen's plan to grab
arkady and sharov.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.280
What about it?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.182
It doesn't work.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.184
We've run over 30
different simulations.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.120
Even under perfect conditions,
with everything working

13:09.122 --> 13:13.158
To their favor, the best
possible outcome is one casualty

13:13.160 --> 13:14.926
And two arrests.

13:14.928 --> 13:17.428
(blipping)

13:17.430 --> 13:20.331
Look, I appreciate
your skill set,

13:20.333 --> 13:23.067
But real life
isn't a computer game.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.170
You're right, it's not.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.505
We get to reset
and try again.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.140
They can't.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.821
Why are you still up?

13:45.292 --> 13:46.591
(sighs heavily)

13:46.593 --> 13:49.527
Sleeping has never been
one of my strong suits.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.831
Aren't you cold?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.365
Freezing out here.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.401
Eh, I'm okay.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.106
Who's that?

14:02.108 --> 14:06.377
Remember you asked
about a backup plan?

14:06.379 --> 14:09.347
You may be looking at him.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.850
According to our tech guys,

14:11.852 --> 14:13.585
We have a less than
six percent chance

14:13.587 --> 14:15.253
Of pulling this off.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.426
Maybe we get lucky.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.998
And maybe we get
captured and killed.

14:32.572 --> 14:35.440
You shouldn't have gotten
involved in all this.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.545
You couldn't have
done this alone.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.547
Yeah, but at least, then,

14:42.549 --> 14:45.550
Nobody else gets hurt,
if I fail a solo attempt.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.219
We have come too
far to back down.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.355
Besides, pavel...

14:50.357 --> 14:53.391
May be able to turn
the odds in our favor.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.459
How?

14:54.461 --> 14:59.097
By changing where
the game is played.

14:59.099 --> 15:02.233
Look, we have a
big day tomorrow.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.269
Why don't you get some sleep.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.938
Oh. No, no, no.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.407
I'm fine. (sniffles)

15:09.409 --> 15:11.609
Really.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.078
Just, um,

15:14.080 --> 15:16.381
Tell me the plan.

15:16.383 --> 15:19.317
Well, first we have
to find pavel.

15:19.319 --> 15:21.653
He's got the connections
to make some things happen.

15:21.655 --> 15:26.324
But he is going to want
something from us in return.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.394
Guy like pavel...

15:29.396 --> 15:32.030
It's not about money for him.

15:32.032 --> 15:35.333
And we always run the risk
of him selling us out.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.138
Pavel:
Charming place.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.307
We can talk here.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.310
Surveillance blind spot.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.980
They are becoming harder
to find these days.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.248
Callen: You didn't have to come.
We appreciate it.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.117
What brings you
back to moscow?

16:26.119 --> 16:28.152
We're here
for arkady.
(scoffs)

16:28.154 --> 16:30.989
You risked so much
to come here for that man?

16:30.991 --> 16:32.590
Sam:
Not me. I'm here

16:32.592 --> 16:35.660
For the other guy.
A man named balinski
is being held with arkady.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.545
In nazarovo prison?
Yeah.

16:37.546 --> 16:39.429
No way you break anyone out
of that place.
Sam: We know.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.066
That's why we need
to get 'em moved.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.534
Ah.

16:43.536 --> 16:46.604
And you think
I can move prisoners?

16:46.606 --> 16:48.139
We do.

16:48.141 --> 16:50.641
Who exactly do you think I am?

16:50.643 --> 16:52.243
Who do you think
I work for?

16:52.245 --> 16:54.178
That's not our concern.

16:54.180 --> 16:56.514
It's probably best
that we don't know.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.616
Yeah, you are right.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.684
Can you help us?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.353
Can I get prisoners moved?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.188
Maybe.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.058
The question you should be
asking is: Do I want to?

17:07.060 --> 17:08.259
No, it's not.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.629
The question is:
What do you need from us?

17:11.631 --> 17:12.630
(chuckles)

17:12.632 --> 17:14.032
I like that.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.700
I like you guys.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.603
Tell me, does everybody
in los angeles talk like you?

17:18.605 --> 17:21.272
How do we get this done?

17:24.110 --> 17:28.513
There is a... Man of interest
to us in los angeles.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.182
He's wanted by the police
department, but they, mm,

17:31.184 --> 17:33.051
Have yet to apprehend him.

17:33.053 --> 17:36.120
After we grab him, then what?

17:36.122 --> 17:38.056
Nothing.
You do your job,

17:38.058 --> 17:39.590
You give him over
to the police,

17:39.592 --> 17:42.060
They put him in jail,

17:42.062 --> 17:45.096
We let nature take its course.

17:45.098 --> 17:47.198
And when it's done?
Your people

17:47.200 --> 17:49.667
Will be transferred
from nazarovo prison.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.836
What's this man's name?

17:51.838 --> 17:55.373
Artem fedor.

17:58.511 --> 18:02.113
California has, uh, much nicer

18:02.115 --> 18:04.682
Weather than russia, huh?

18:04.684 --> 18:07.752
Maybe it's better
you stay there from now on.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.629
Did you find anything
on artem fedor?

18:18.631 --> 18:20.164
Yeah, but it's a little weird.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.332
What's weird?

18:21.334 --> 18:23.334
Well, lapd has
an open warrant on him

18:23.336 --> 18:24.836
For credit card fraud, but...

18:24.838 --> 18:26.504
They don't seem to be
actively pursuing him.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.672
Deeks:
That's not weird.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.140
Warrant services is
always backlogged

18:29.142 --> 18:30.575
By, like, 100 people.
They'll get to it.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.143
No, no, no. That's not it.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.478
What's weird is...
Granger:
What's weird?

18:35.715 --> 18:38.516
Look, here's the thing,
assistant director,

18:38.518 --> 18:42.253
Why does pavel volkoff, all the
way in moscow, care so much

18:42.255 --> 18:44.856
About a guy wanted
for credit card fraud in l.A.?

18:44.858 --> 18:46.390
That's a good point.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.226
What else do we know
about this guy?

18:48.228 --> 18:50.228
I mean, not much.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.896
He was born in saratov, russia.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.898
His parents brought him here
when he was five years old.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.399
And he lives
in hollywood.

18:55.401 --> 18:58.836
This guy's into more
than credit card fraud.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.204
Want us to pick him up?

19:00.206 --> 19:01.672
Yes.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.574
Take beale with you.

19:04.844 --> 19:08.346
Great. Meet you downstairs
in five.
All right.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.320
Is there a problem?

19:16.322 --> 19:17.788
No.

19:17.790 --> 19:19.924
I've been training
to be in the field.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.359
(nervous laugh):
But I just...

19:21.361 --> 19:23.227
You got five minutes.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.396
Go put on some pants.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.542
You're sending
mr. Beale out into the field.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.410
Yeah.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.279
You think he's ready?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.381
Is anyone ever ready?

19:43.382 --> 19:45.482
Is it possible to answer a
question with another question?

19:45.485 --> 19:47.418
That is the question.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.487
Look, he's been training.
His evals

19:49.489 --> 19:51.322
Are good...
Oh, my.

19:51.324 --> 19:55.193
So, we're out of here.
Finally.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.328
Just be happy
you missed the whole, uh,

19:57.330 --> 19:59.297
Beale wardrobe montage that
happened back there.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.988
But it's fine.

20:00.989 --> 20:02.678
We worked it out.
He's gonna go with

20:02.679 --> 20:04.368
The extra medium in... Shiny.
Hetty: Ah.

20:04.370 --> 20:08.606
Right. Uh, you need to get
a jacket from wardrobe

20:08.608 --> 20:09.941
To conceal your gun.

20:09.943 --> 20:12.910
My guns?

20:12.912 --> 20:14.946
Your nine millimeter.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.949
Oh. Right. Because
the jacket would...

20:17.951 --> 20:20.284
All right, serpico.
Oh...

20:20.286 --> 20:21.319
This is gonna
work out.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.220
Kensi.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.354
Yeah.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.323
Watch him?

20:25.325 --> 20:27.391
Yes, ma'am.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.461
(sighs)

20:35.702 --> 20:37.368
Our team in l.A.
Located fedor.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.237
They're gonna make
contact with him now.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.905
Great.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.240
Coffee?

20:42.242 --> 20:43.841
Sure.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.849
Thanks.

20:54.254 --> 20:57.388
Come on. Join me.

21:06.332 --> 21:08.766
(grunts)

21:12.705 --> 21:14.772
What do you think about me?

21:19.946 --> 21:21.646
That's kind of a broad question.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.381
(quiet laugh)

21:23.383 --> 21:24.448
(chuckles)

21:24.450 --> 21:26.017
Yeah, I guess it is.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.052
Callen,

21:28.054 --> 21:31.355
I don't know
if what I'm doing is right.

21:31.357 --> 21:33.291
About arkady?

21:36.496 --> 21:39.497
When I was a child...
(wry laugh)

21:39.499 --> 21:42.566
I used to make up these stories
about him.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.903
Stories about him doing amazing
things all over the world.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.539
Being a hero.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.741
Helping people.

21:50.743 --> 21:55.079
And for those reasons,
he wasn't able to be there.

21:55.081 --> 21:58.382
There wasn't enough time for him
to be your dad.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.854
You know these stories.

22:10.430 --> 22:15.499
I would wager
that your stories...

22:19.439 --> 22:21.439
...They were better
than the stories I told myself

22:21.441 --> 22:22.773
When I was a kid.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.542
Why is that?

22:26.479 --> 22:28.813
Your dad had a name.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.456
(laughing):
Why do you smile?

22:38.458 --> 22:41.125
(chuckles)

22:41.127 --> 22:43.127
I just...

22:43.129 --> 22:47.131
I try to tell myself that-that
people that do what we do,

22:47.133 --> 22:49.567
Do the jobs that we do,

22:49.569 --> 22:53.037
I try to tell myself
that we're normal.

22:53.039 --> 22:58.142
But the only people
I come across are broken,

22:58.144 --> 23:00.411
Like me.

23:05.151 --> 23:07.752
Maybe being broken is normal.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.162
Do you know why we're
sitting in the car

23:18.164 --> 23:19.597
And not going
straight to the door?

23:19.599 --> 23:20.731
Yeah, it's better
if we can...

23:20.733 --> 23:22.666
Seriously?
I am asking beale.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.835
Oh. You don't have
to be all snippy about it.

23:24.837 --> 23:25.936
Eric (clears throat):
Um...

23:25.938 --> 23:26.971
We want to get him

23:26.973 --> 23:28.740
When he's either coming
or going.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.508
Exactly. Want to make the arrest
as smooth as possible.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.909
No gunfire.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.911
No... Did you say "gunfire"?

23:33.913 --> 23:37.081
You-you think this guy fedor
would shoot at us to get away?

23:37.083 --> 23:40.017
I think anybody would.

23:42.688 --> 23:44.155
There he is. Let's go.

23:44.157 --> 23:47.858
Keep your gun holstered.
Stay behind us and to my left.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.696
Artem fedor. Federal agents.

23:52.698 --> 23:53.964
Deeks: Put your hands
behind your head.

23:53.966 --> 23:57.168
Yes... Yes...
Wh-what's this about, officer?

23:57.170 --> 23:58.469
Stop moving.
We will not ask again.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.606
Gun!

24:03.443 --> 24:04.608
Beale, behind me!

24:05.912 --> 24:07.611
Beale, move! Down! Get down!

24:17.657 --> 24:18.489
Oh, crap!

24:23.663 --> 24:25.129
Keep your head
down, beale!

24:35.541 --> 24:36.073
(grunts)

24:36.809 --> 24:38.108
(grunting)

24:38.110 --> 24:39.176
Down!

24:45.918 --> 24:46.951
(fedor grunting in pain)

24:46.953 --> 24:48.552
You good?

24:48.554 --> 24:49.587
Yeah.

24:49.589 --> 24:50.955
(groans)

24:50.957 --> 24:52.156
What the hell was that?

24:52.158 --> 24:55.192
Well, it works in<i> call of duty.</i>

24:55.962 --> 24:57.595
(wry laugh)

25:09.575 --> 25:11.642
(indistinct chatter)

25:11.644 --> 25:13.143
You don't, uh...

25:13.145 --> 25:16.046
Have any more live explosives
on you, do you, beale?

25:16.048 --> 25:17.581
No. Just, uh,
some tactical supplies.

25:17.583 --> 25:19.583
Ah.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.585
Kensi:
You okay?

25:21.587 --> 25:23.654
Yeah, I'm good.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.973
Hey, I'm-I'm sorry.

25:25.974 --> 25:28.291
'cause I could've really
hurt someone with that
flashbang and...

25:28.294 --> 25:30.594
And nothing. You did good.

25:30.596 --> 25:31.595
Really?
Yeah.

25:31.597 --> 25:33.797
You did great.

25:33.799 --> 25:35.799
Hey. Do you think
I'm a natural?

25:35.801 --> 25:37.668
Because I always felt
like I was, um...

25:37.670 --> 25:39.537
I was destined
for-for great things.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.805
I mean,
not skywalker-great but...

25:41.807 --> 25:44.975
But, like, a potential
within my soul...
And the greatness is gone.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.545
Can we go? Yeah.
Shall we?

25:47.547 --> 25:48.846
Deeks: Detective.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.281
Bye, guys.
I'll see you.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.863
(man speaking over p.A.
In russian)
(indistinct chatter)

26:24.083 --> 26:25.849
(electronic lock buzzing)

26:27.219 --> 26:28.352
(doors ratcheting, clanking)

26:33.759 --> 26:36.060
(grunting)

26:40.967 --> 26:44.668
(grunting, muttering)

26:44.670 --> 26:46.604
(grunting)

26:49.308 --> 26:51.375
(door whirring, clanking)

26:52.311 --> 26:55.179
(guard groans)

26:55.181 --> 26:57.247
(playing slow,
gentle melody on harp)

27:02.054 --> 27:04.054
Oh...

27:04.056 --> 27:06.056
You play the harp.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.791
Yes.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.259
Since I was six.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.895
Instructors urged me
to become professional.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.697
Mm-hmm! Impressive.

27:13.699 --> 27:17.868
Yeah. But, you know, for me, the
harp is not a tool of commerce

27:17.870 --> 27:21.138
But something to play
for family and friends.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.806
Mm.
It's a gift of love

27:22.808 --> 27:24.325
That I just love giving,

27:24.326 --> 27:25.843
'cause that's the type
of person I am.

27:25.845 --> 27:27.711
Aw. Isn't that sweet?
Mm.

27:27.713 --> 27:30.247
(chuckling)
you're hilarious.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.249
I do play
a mean harmonica, though.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.751
I believe you.
(chuckles)

27:33.753 --> 27:35.753
(chuckles)

27:35.755 --> 27:39.757
Pavel received confirmation
that fedor is in lapd custody.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.226
Arkady and sharov are being
loaded onto a transport.

27:42.228 --> 27:43.727
City road or rural?

27:43.729 --> 27:45.195
Rural. Small medical transport.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.698
Just the two guards
and the two prisoners.

27:47.700 --> 27:50.234
Medical transport, huh?

27:50.236 --> 27:52.903
Looks like pavel thinks
a lot like us.

27:52.905 --> 27:54.905
Mm-hmm.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.445
¶ ¶

28:01.447 --> 28:03.080
(crows cawing in distance)

28:08.788 --> 28:10.454
(sighs)

28:13.259 --> 28:14.324
(grunts)

28:16.962 --> 28:19.029
(mooing)

28:20.966 --> 28:22.866
(speaks russian)

28:22.868 --> 28:24.968
(horn honks)

28:26.839 --> 28:28.906
(cow mooing)

28:32.378 --> 28:34.845
(speaking russian
in distance)

28:37.817 --> 28:39.883
(cow mooing)

28:43.956 --> 28:45.789
(grunting)

28:48.360 --> 28:50.794
(grunting)

28:50.796 --> 28:51.862
(groans)

28:54.233 --> 28:55.933
(grunts)

28:58.037 --> 29:00.471
(grunting)

29:00.473 --> 29:01.905
(both grunting)

29:02.975 --> 29:05.843
(grunting)

29:08.748 --> 29:09.513
Clear!

29:11.884 --> 29:12.950
(handcuffs tightening)

29:15.387 --> 29:17.788
Callen: Go.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.523
Anna.
Come on, we got to move.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.960
(panting)

29:22.962 --> 29:25.929
(cow mooing)

29:29.135 --> 29:31.335
A flashbang, huh?

29:31.337 --> 29:33.504
Happened so fast,
before I knew it...

29:33.506 --> 29:35.405
Guess I got lucky.

29:35.407 --> 29:38.475
I don't think luck had
anything to do with it.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.477
I think...

29:40.479 --> 29:44.014
You knew what you needed to do,
and you did it.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.083
And I'm proud of you.

29:46.919 --> 29:49.019
Nell...

29:49.021 --> 29:52.006
I was scared
that I couldn't...

29:52.007 --> 29:54.992
Just received a confirmation
text from callen's sat phone.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.995
"got the milk and bread,
no duck."

29:57.997 --> 30:01.298
They secured arkady and sharov,
and they can't fly out.

30:01.300 --> 30:04.118
Someone's injured.

30:04.119 --> 30:06.937
They can't use their planned
exfil at the commercial airport.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.513
Arkady.

30:17.550 --> 30:19.850
Thank you for finding me, anna.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.451
For not giving up on me.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.987
Yeah... The past
is the past.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.956
And my past with you
is not so good.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.158
I will do better.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.198
I'm gonna call hetty.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.266
We need a contingency plan.

30:48.614 --> 30:50.113
How you doing?

30:51.050 --> 30:52.249
It's amazing to finally put

30:52.251 --> 30:53.517
A face to your voice.
(laughs)

30:53.519 --> 30:56.186
(panting)

30:56.188 --> 30:58.455
Pretending to know me
isn't gonna make us trust you

30:58.457 --> 30:59.923
Any more than we already do.

30:59.925 --> 31:02.226
You know I'm with the company.

31:02.228 --> 31:04.461
We vetted you.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.931
You checked out, but
that doesn't mean you're real.

31:07.933 --> 31:10.400
Callen, my voice doesn't
sound familiar to you?

31:10.402 --> 31:12.236
Should it?

31:13.873 --> 31:16.540
While you were stationed
in russia, working moscow,

31:16.542 --> 31:19.610
I manned a few different
safe houses over the years.

31:19.612 --> 31:21.612
Oh, yeah?

31:21.614 --> 31:24.314
You were in
sevastapol, right?

31:24.316 --> 31:26.416
I don't know. Was I?

31:26.418 --> 31:28.118
(panting)

31:28.120 --> 31:30.120
Why did I call in?

31:30.122 --> 31:32.189
Because she wasn't
who she said she was.

31:32.191 --> 31:33.323
She?

31:33.325 --> 31:35.626
Your asset.
I don't remember her name.

31:35.628 --> 31:39.029
It was a long time ago.
I'm sorry.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.999
But I do remember
they turned their backs on you.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.001
Because you were alone,

31:44.003 --> 31:47.504
If you didn't find a safe haven
that night, you'd die.

31:47.506 --> 31:49.506
(groans)

31:49.508 --> 31:52.542
You directed me
to that safe house?

31:52.544 --> 31:55.078
Yeah.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.681
(groaning)

31:57.683 --> 31:59.449
(panting)

31:59.451 --> 32:03.086
I take it because of my injury
we can't have a safe extract?

32:03.088 --> 32:05.289
No.

32:05.291 --> 32:07.124
I have an active code.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.459
All I need is a sat phone.

32:09.461 --> 32:12.062
Everyone but sharov can wait
for a new extract.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.614
His wounds are deep;
he's losing blood.

32:13.615 --> 32:15.165
Hetty:
If he is who he says he is,

32:15.167 --> 32:18.168
He should be able
to find you a safe house.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.070
If he isn't?

32:20.072 --> 32:23.473
If this was just a trap
to get us back into russia?

32:23.475 --> 32:26.677
He said he knew callen.

32:26.679 --> 32:30.080
Let's have him make the call.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.348
Copy that.
(groaning)

32:31.350 --> 32:32.950
What'd she say?

32:32.952 --> 32:37.054
No new info.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.089
Your call.

32:39.091 --> 32:41.325
(sharov groaning in pain)

32:59.311 --> 33:00.377
Callen:
This is it.

33:03.983 --> 33:06.149
(turns engine off)

33:06.151 --> 33:07.718
Sam: What now?

33:07.720 --> 33:09.386
I don't know. These
are the coordinates

33:09.388 --> 33:11.021
They gave me for
the safe house.

33:11.023 --> 33:12.689
Doesn't look like safe house.

33:12.691 --> 33:15.192
Man (over radio):
Look to your left.

33:17.730 --> 33:23.233
Your vehicle is parked directly
on top of a 40-pound ied.

33:23.235 --> 33:27.204
It will detonate if I do not
receive a proper I.D. Number,

33:27.206 --> 33:30.574
Color of the week
and code of the day.

33:33.512 --> 33:39.182
I.D. Number 00-58-11-029.

33:39.184 --> 33:41.551
Color of the week: Aqua.

33:41.553 --> 33:43.086
Seventy-one...

33:43.088 --> 33:47.591
Bravo-lima-92-alpha,

33:47.593 --> 33:50.293
Foxtrot-32.

33:54.500 --> 33:58.268
Man: Turn right off the dirt
road, proceed 5.2 kilometers.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.805
You'll see a path.
Walk in from there.

34:01.807 --> 34:05.208
Ied is deactivated. Proceed.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.277
(engine starting)

34:10.582 --> 34:13.383
(engine revving)

34:45.184 --> 34:47.717
Seems you've had
an eventful stay in russia.

34:50.389 --> 34:54.291
My name is garrison.

34:54.293 --> 34:55.358
Hello. I'm sharov.

34:58.263 --> 35:01.298
That's arkady,
his daughter anna.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.233
I'm sam.

35:06.705 --> 35:08.738
And you are?

35:08.740 --> 35:11.408
Callen.

35:13.345 --> 35:15.278
(crow cawing in distance)

35:15.280 --> 35:17.280
Good to meet you.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.382
We should move.
We're on the clock.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.292
(crow cawing in distance)

35:34.633 --> 35:35.699
It's good.

35:38.570 --> 35:42.305
(sighing)

35:42.307 --> 35:44.141
You should have
some coffee.

35:44.143 --> 35:45.876
Anna:
No, I'm... I'm fine.

35:45.878 --> 35:49.646
Arkady:
It's getting cold.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.782
Matryoshka dolls.

35:52.784 --> 35:55.218
Like peeling the
layers of an onion.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.187
Yeah, I guess
he makes 'em.

35:58.223 --> 36:00.490
If he made all these,
he's been here for a while.

36:00.492 --> 36:03.326
Callen: Yeah.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.196
What's up, g?

36:06.198 --> 36:08.231
Garrison: Don't worry.
You'll be all right.

36:08.233 --> 36:09.432
Nothing.

36:09.434 --> 36:11.334
I don't feel nothing.

36:12.938 --> 36:15.906
G, this guy, garrison?

36:21.346 --> 36:23.613
Magical with a paintbrush.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.683
Yeah.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.718
Yeah, he is.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.587
Anna:
You're right, arkady.

36:30.589 --> 36:31.755
(radio beeping)

36:31.757 --> 36:33.356
You're right.

36:33.358 --> 36:35.258
(beep)

36:38.230 --> 36:40.297
(sighs)

36:43.302 --> 36:45.569
Garrison:
Gentlemen.

36:49.474 --> 36:52.475
(door opening)

36:57.382 --> 36:59.983
(crow cawing)

36:59.985 --> 37:01.351
He is stable now.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.552
(horse sputters)

37:02.554 --> 37:03.853
So we can move him.

37:05.257 --> 37:09.392
Yes... But there is
another problem.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.661
They found the prison van?

37:11.663 --> 37:14.431
Search party was mobilized.

37:14.433 --> 37:16.433
They'll be scanning the area.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.868
Is this place known
to the russian police?

37:18.870 --> 37:20.403
Tough to say.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.405
I've never
had problems,

37:22.407 --> 37:25.408
But if choppers and drones
go up, we'll be visited.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.876
What's our timeframe?

37:26.878 --> 37:29.679
The exfil team is meeting us
at sunup tomorrow.

37:29.681 --> 37:32.616
I can get them here faster,
but it means leaving now

37:32.618 --> 37:34.718
And travelling in the daylight.

37:34.720 --> 37:38.355
Or you hole up in my basement
and hope for the best.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.923
(horse sputters, crow caws)

37:39.925 --> 37:41.925
We'll go now.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.760
Good call.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.929
I'll alert the team.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.364
What's our exfil?

37:47.366 --> 37:49.332
Private jet out of an airstrip

37:49.334 --> 37:50.834
That doesn't exist.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.369
We take our truck there?

37:52.371 --> 37:53.937
If only it were that easy.

37:53.939 --> 37:56.473
Vehicles won't make it;
too narrow.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.341
(horse neighing)

37:58.343 --> 37:59.943
(chuckles)

37:59.945 --> 38:02.545
Giddyup? (laughs)

38:04.316 --> 38:06.049
We go through
the pass.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.784
It's steep.
Stay close.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.620
Are we sure that this is
the only way, on these beasts?

38:10.622 --> 38:12.489
Are you kidding me?

38:12.491 --> 38:15.592
I'm on a horse, freezing
my butt off because of you.

38:15.594 --> 38:16.993
And I appreciate that, but...

38:16.995 --> 38:18.328
But nothing!

38:18.330 --> 38:19.562
We pulled you out of that jail.

38:19.564 --> 38:21.247
Ride your damn horse!

38:21.248 --> 38:22.931
And I am aware of all of this,
but I just...

38:22.934 --> 38:24.868
Stop talking, arkady.
I want to, but...

38:24.870 --> 38:26.336
Stop talking,

38:26.338 --> 38:28.872
Or I'll take you back
to nazarovo myself.

38:28.874 --> 38:31.675
Hmm?
I once had to eat one of these.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.702
Garrison: Stop here.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.644
Exfil team will meet us here.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.646
(groaning)

39:09.648 --> 39:12.415
Anna, arkady...

39:12.417 --> 39:14.484
We'll be leaving fast
when that exfil team gets here,

39:14.486 --> 39:16.486
So let's get fresh dressings
on sharov.

39:16.488 --> 39:17.587
You got it.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.493
Thank you, garrison.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.628
Be safe, sam.

39:28.433 --> 39:30.500
(crows cawing in distance)

39:31.570 --> 39:34.003
Thank you for your help.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.905
(sighs)

39:35.907 --> 39:37.974
You know who I am?

39:42.114 --> 39:44.414
I think so.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.551
Maybe, yeah.

39:48.553 --> 39:51.121
I don't know.

39:51.123 --> 39:55.125
I know much about you.

39:55.127 --> 39:57.927
And you don't...

39:57.929 --> 39:59.829
Don't know me.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.534
I don't believe in excuses,

40:04.536 --> 40:08.071
Giving reasons for actions.

40:08.073 --> 40:11.141
The actions themselves
are what matters.

40:13.578 --> 40:16.045
Well, sometimes.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.049
You can hate me.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.754
I don't hate you.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.123
But the reasons matter.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.626
To me, they matter.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.163
Then I will tell you.

40:33.165 --> 40:35.698
(vehicle approaching)

40:41.573 --> 40:43.006
Another time...

40:43.008 --> 40:45.008
I will tell it to you all.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.676
Everything.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.013
Man: Anyone up here
request an uber?

40:50.015 --> 40:52.582
Yes, we did commander.

40:52.584 --> 40:54.117
Hopefully, you got
a couple of bottles

40:54.119 --> 40:55.618
We can pop
in those jalopies.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.719
Ah, sir, sorry,
no champagne,

40:56.721 --> 40:58.555
But we did stock mres.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.824
Good to see
you again, sam.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.626
Let's move 'em out.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.728
Callen...

41:06.698 --> 41:09.132
I know who you are
and the things you've done.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.600
Man 2:
Got your six covered.

41:12.737 --> 41:15.605
You are a good man.

41:15.607 --> 41:18.174
Man:
Sorry, sir,

41:18.176 --> 41:20.009
But we do need
to leave right now.

41:34.559 --> 41:36.759
<i> Do svidaniya, grisha.</i>

41:38.530 --> 41:40.663
Grisha?

41:40.665 --> 41:45.235
Grisha aleksandrovich...

41:45.237 --> 41:47.770
Nikolaev.

41:52.978 --> 41:56.079
Your mother wanted you to
know from where you came.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.987
(vehicle doors closing)
man: All right, let's go.

42:03.989 --> 42:05.955
Man 2:
All right. Clear comms.

42:05.957 --> 42:07.957
Man:
Copy that.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.860
(indistinct, distant chatter)

42:10.862 --> 42:14.030
G... You good?

42:14.032 --> 42:15.298
Yeah.

42:19.771 --> 42:21.104
I'm good.
