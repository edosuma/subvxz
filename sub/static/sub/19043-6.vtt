I waited on that
father of yours,

22:08.886 --> 22:13.455
That awful, awful man,
that drunk.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.056
I should have left him.

22:15.058 --> 22:18.225
What did I do?
I-- I made excuses
for him,

22:18.227 --> 22:20.060
I-- I let him do
whatever he wanted,

22:20.062 --> 22:23.063
I let him say
terrible things
to you kids.

22:23.065 --> 22:25.698
And then when he did die,
I thought,

22:25.700 --> 22:28.100
"oh, my god,
why did I do that?"

22:28.102 --> 22:34.105
It was my fault,
hangin' around a
poisonous well

22:34.107 --> 22:35.406
Just 'cause
I didn't want to walk

22:35.408 --> 22:37.340
A few miles
to the next one.

22:39.443 --> 22:40.943
- Whoo.
- <i>Well, I think you should</i>

22:40.945 --> 22:42.945
<i>Go see this man,</i>
<i>christine.</i>

22:42.947 --> 22:45.647
I got some condoms
in the bureau.

22:45.649 --> 22:48.783
Well, he's--
he's all the way in denver.

22:48.785 --> 22:52.119
Ooh. And you're telling me
that you, of all people,

22:52.121 --> 22:53.986
Don't have free miles?

22:55.955 --> 22:58.289
Yeah,
I have free miles.

23:03.427 --> 23:05.227
Hey, martha,
can we go to home depot?

23:05.229 --> 23:08.163
- Sure.
- Great.

23:08.165 --> 23:10.999
Hey, did you know that
if your index finger,

23:11.001 --> 23:12.834
And your ring finger
are the same length,

23:12.836 --> 23:14.969
It means you're
charming?

23:14.971 --> 23:20.107
Or, wait, it's either
charming or schizophrenic.

23:20.109 --> 23:21.241
I can't remember.

23:21.243 --> 23:22.609
What are you doing?

23:22.611 --> 23:24.010
Just chatting.

23:24.012 --> 23:27.446
Isn't that
what friends do?

23:27.448 --> 23:30.682
Okay, yeah. Sure.
What was it again?

23:30.684 --> 23:32.750
I think it's if
your index finger,

23:32.752 --> 23:34.284
- And your ring finger
are the same--
- oh, yeah, right.

23:34.286 --> 23:36.586
Got it. Yeah,
I'm schizophrenic.

23:36.588 --> 23:38.854
Well,
I guess me, too.

23:38.856 --> 23:40.155
You're schizophrenic.
Trust me.

23:40.157 --> 23:42.023
Um--

23:42.025 --> 23:45.426
- Well--
- I guess we were
meant to be friends.

23:45.428 --> 23:47.861
Well, that's nice.

23:47.863 --> 23:49.262
Or sad.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.466
Hi, meemaw,
how are you?

23:54.468 --> 23:56.301
- Hi.
- Hi, lamb chop.

23:56.303 --> 24:00.138
Hey, um, I, uh,
brought mom a toilet,
'cause I broke hers.

24:00.140 --> 24:02.773
- Is she here?
- She ain't here, honey.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.041
- Sorry.
- Okay, I wanted her
to give it a test.

24:05.043 --> 24:06.643
