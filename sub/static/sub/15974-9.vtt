WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:03.636
The Olympic
gold medal-winning gymnast

00:03.703 --> 00:04.932
and high-school
sophomore said,

00:05.005 --> 00:06.530
"That after all those years
of hard work,

00:06.606 --> 00:10.236
<i>it was a relief to finally
realize her lifelong dream."</i>

00:10.310 --> 00:12.745
Good to get
that out of the way at 15.

00:12.812 --> 00:15.406
Folks, if you've been watching
CSC's continuing coverage

00:15.482 --> 00:17.541
of Desmond Corey's assault
on Mount Everest,

00:17.617 --> 00:19.585
you'll want to set
your alarms tomorrow.

00:19.652 --> 00:21.916
2:00 A.M. Eastern or thereabout
is when Corey's team

00:21.988 --> 00:24.582
is expected to be sending back
the first live-video footage.

00:24.657 --> 00:26.921
Dan and I will be here
with plenty of hot coffee,

00:26.993 --> 00:28.427
and we hope you'll join us

00:28.495 --> 00:30.759
for what we're sure is gonna be
a very exciting event.

00:30.830 --> 00:34.391
You're watching "Sports Night"
on CSC, so stick around.

00:34.467 --> 00:36.435
-- <i>We're out.</i>
-- <i>Two minutes back.</i>

00:36.503 --> 00:38.267
29,000 feet --
you know how tall that is?

00:38.338 --> 00:40.238
It's 29,000 feet.

00:40.306 --> 00:41.296
Yes.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.172
It's actually 29,029 feet.

00:43.243 --> 00:44.836
And it's those last 10 yards
that'll kill you.

00:44.911 --> 00:47.278
It's huge.
It 8,848 meters.

00:47.347 --> 00:50.112
<i>It sounds more impressive
at 29,000 feet.</i>

00:50.183 --> 00:52.277
All right, I'm gonna stick
with 29,000 feet.

00:52.352 --> 00:54.684
How can I best express this?

00:54.754 --> 00:57.246
How many of what kind of thing would
we have to line up end to end?

00:57.323 --> 00:59.087
29,000 rulers.

00:59.159 --> 01:02.356
I don't think you people are quite
getting into the spirit of the hill.

01:02.429 --> 01:03.624
The spirit of the hill?

01:03.696 --> 01:05.186
-- <i>The spirit of the hill.</i>
-- <i>How about this?</i>

01:05.265 --> 01:07.233
If I shot you
out of a missile silo,

01:07.300 --> 01:08.768
you'd have to go 29,000 feet

01:08.835 --> 01:10.929
in order to clear
the peak of Everest,

01:11.004 --> 01:12.870
land on a pile of rocks
in Tibet,

01:12.939 --> 01:14.065
and shut the hell up.

01:14.140 --> 01:15.733
I'm just saying
it's a big mountain.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.937
And I hear ya.
[Laughs]

01:21.848 --> 01:23.373
Cold outside?

01:23.450 --> 01:25.885
Not fit for man nor beast
out there, but here I am.

01:25.952 --> 01:27.010
Any good mail?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.248
Everybody needs money.

01:28.321 --> 01:29.618
Well, who's everybody?

01:29.689 --> 01:32.249
Everybody -- medical research,
hospitals, schools,

01:32.325 --> 01:34.191
animal shelters,
day-care centers,

01:34.260 --> 01:36.592
boy scouts, girl scouts,
all kinds of scouts.

01:36.663 --> 01:38.290
You got yourself
on a mailing list.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.662
Oh, I'm on the mailing list
to end all mailing lists.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.223
Well, who did
you give money to?

01:42.302 --> 01:43.827
I honestly can't remember,
Casey.

01:43.903 --> 01:45.928
A couple of months ago
I wrote a check to someone.

01:46.005 --> 01:48.099
Now I'm in the middle
of Dickensian London.

01:48.174 --> 01:49.835
I'd love to give money
to all these people,

01:49.909 --> 01:51.377
but then
I'd have no money,

01:51.444 --> 01:52.843
and I'd need s0me0ne's mailing
list just to pay rent.

01:52.912 --> 01:54.971
-- It's a vicious circle.
-- It is.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.174
It's a never-ending circle.

01:56.249 --> 01:58.513
-- Just keeps going round and round.
-- Never ends.

01:58.585 --> 02:00.519
-- Which makes it vicious.
-- And a circle.

02:00.587 --> 02:02.521
-- So what do I do?
-- About what?

02:02.589 --> 02:05.854
-- You're <i>not listening at</i> all. -- <i>I was
iistening</i> a <i>iittie. I remember the circie.</i>

02:05.925 --> 02:07.552
I'm inactive.
I don't act.

02:07.627 --> 02:10.392
I talk a pretty good game, but in the end
I just sit there completely inactive.

02:10.463 --> 02:13.057
-- Ah, like the trusty basset hound.
-- Yes.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.727
-- Except basset hounds don't
talk a good game. -- Right.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.463
-- They can't talk at all, Danny. --
Do you understand what I'm saying?

02:17.537 --> 02:19.335
-- They're dogs.
-- I'm inactive.

02:19.405 --> 02:20.634
Pick a letter.
Write a check.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.573
Which would certainly ease
my liberal guilt.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.804
-- It's a vicious circle.
-- Very vicious.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.812
You know, while we've been
having this conversation,

02:26.880 --> 02:29.645
a couple of people have probably died
from something you could have cured.

02:29.716 --> 02:31.377
That's great, Casey --
easing of the pressure.

02:31.451 --> 02:32.646
Let's take a look.

02:32.719 --> 02:35.154
"The Montgomery
Symphony Orchestra."

02:35.221 --> 02:37.383
-- Montgomery, Alabama?
-- Who cares?

02:37.457 --> 02:39.687
What's wrong with music, and why
shouldn't Montgomery have some?

02:39.759 --> 02:42.854
VVell, there's nothing wrong with music,
and Montgomery obviously <i>does</i> have some,

02:42.929 --> 02:44.897
but this is
about prioritizing.

02:44.964 --> 02:47.490
I don't think the world is suffering from
a lack of quality symphony orchestras.

02:47.567 --> 02:48.659
-- Do you?
-- No.

02:48.735 --> 02:50.100
-- Okay. -- But music,
culture, the arts --

02:50.170 --> 02:52.571
these things shouldn't be confined
to just New York and Vienna.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.471
It's settled then.

02:54.541 --> 02:57.533
The Montgomery Symphony gets a
charitable donation from Dan Rydell.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.442
Not so fast.
What's the next one?

02:59.512 --> 03:01.742
"The American Heart
Association."

03:01.814 --> 03:04.784
Oh, and I suppose they're
trying to cure a disease.

03:04.851 --> 03:08.082
Tell you what -- why don't you have your new
friends in Alabama play them some Beethoven.

03:08.154 --> 03:10.088
I'm gonna need
to think about this one.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.925
<i>Dana: We've got Kelly
from New Orleans</i>

03:13.993 --> 03:16.724
after the Saints finish up,
and Brian in San Francisco.

03:16.796 --> 03:19.060
Natalie, you've got something
from building security?

03:19.132 --> 03:21.396
Yes, they say with the cold
weather already here,

03:21.467 --> 03:23.993
some of our local homeless
have begun spending the night

03:24.070 --> 03:26.004
in the atrium off
the Sixth Avenue lobby.

03:26.072 --> 03:28.734
If we see anyone, we're supposed
to call security at 1-1-6.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.435
VVait a second. Shouldn't we
be doing something for them?

03:30.510 --> 03:32.035
-- Like what?
-- What do they need?

03:32.111 --> 03:33.203
-- The homeless?
-- Yeah.

03:33.279 --> 03:35.077
They need homes.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.138
Moving on.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.378
Do you know
where the Corey team is?

03:38.451 --> 03:40.476
They're gonna strike camp
in just a little while

03:40.553 --> 03:42.715
and head for the Hillary Step
up the southeast face.

03:42.789 --> 03:45.986
-- <i>VVhere are they</i> right <i>now?</i> -- Camp
<i>Four, about 2,500 feet below the summit.</i>

03:46.059 --> 03:49.427
-- That's where the toeholds start getting
pretty scarce. -- Ah, tell me about it.

03:49.495 --> 03:52.089
Radio contact has been coming in
and out, but as far as we know --

03:52.165 --> 03:53.963
-- Excuse me.
-- <i>Hmm?</i>

03:54.033 --> 03:55.398
-- Did you just say, “Tell
me about it“? -- When?

03:55.468 --> 03:56.799
-- <i>Then.</i>
-- Just now?

03:56.869 --> 03:58.928
Jeremy said, "Toeholds start
getting pretty scarce."

03:59.005 --> 04:00.404
And you said,
"Tell me about it."

04:00.473 --> 04:01.770
-- <i>Yes.</i>
-- <i>Implying that?</i>

04:01.841 --> 04:03.832
-- I climb.
-- You <i>climb?</i>

04:03.910 --> 04:06.242
-- I climb. I'm a climber.
-- You <i>climb</i> at your gym.

04:06.312 --> 04:08.246
Darn tootin' I do, and
it's a challenging ascent.

04:08.314 --> 04:09.782
It's a wall in a gym.

04:09.849 --> 04:11.613
It simulates
a Class Ill mountain.

04:11.684 --> 04:14.119
I hear the air gets pretty thin
up near the juice bar.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.951
You know,
mock me if you must,

04:16.022 --> 04:18.423
but I hold in my heart
what few men possess.

04:18.491 --> 04:21.620
A one-year membership to the Big
Apple Health and Racquet Club?

04:21.694 --> 04:23.184
The spirit of the hill.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.424
Tell them, Casey.

04:24.497 --> 04:26.261
[Mockingly]
Yeah, tell us.

04:28.368 --> 04:32.635
There's a hill...
and spirit.

04:32.705 --> 04:34.298
Man,
did you drop the ball!

04:34.374 --> 04:35.398
[Laughter]

04:35.475 --> 04:37.534
Oh, like you've climbed
Kilimanjaro.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.045
All right. So, you all know
the drill for today?

04:40.113 --> 04:41.046
-- We got it. -- Yes. -- Yes.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.548
-- Do you? -- We've got <i>it.</i>
-- Yes.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.209
<i>-- You dmfl, do you'? -- We do.
-- We understand the drill.</i>

04:45.285 --> 04:48.448
-- We do our regular Sunday show --
-- And <i>she's</i> stiff gonna tel! us.

04:48.521 --> 04:50.353
We're gonna do
our regular Sunday show.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.721
We stick around and wait
for the live feed from Everest.

04:52.792 --> 04:54.385
We kick it to Mike and Libby
in Nepal,

04:54.460 --> 04:56.019
and we anchor the special.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.962
That was pretty complicated. Can you
go over that one more time? I --

04:59.032 --> 05:00.431
I'm not gonna be here
this afternoon.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.968
I'm gonna be gone
for, like, four hours.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.696
Everything's under control.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.397
Good.
I'll be back at 7:00.

05:05.471 --> 05:08.270
Uh, I'll need to see
all the tape on the 1:00 games

05:08.341 --> 05:10.400
and anything we've got
on the 4:00s.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.444
Pitch me any features
at the 8:00 rundown,

05:12.512 --> 05:14.810
and somebody stay on top
of Oakland and Baltimore.

05:14.881 --> 05:17.009
[Telephones ringing]

05:17.083 --> 05:19.177
Hey.

05:19.252 --> 05:22.347
Oh, um, where are you
taking your niece?

05:22.422 --> 05:23.480
"The Lion King."

05:23.556 --> 05:25.650
-- She'll love it.
-- Yeah, whatever.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.057
I could really live without
a Broadway musical today.

05:28.127 --> 05:30.721
I think it'll be good for you.
You've been working too hard.

05:30.797 --> 05:33.129
It's good to get out and see
life beyond these walls.

05:33.199 --> 05:34.963
I got a video crew
in the Himalayas, Isaac.

05:35.034 --> 05:36.900
How much further outside
do you want me to go?

05:36.969 --> 05:40.337
I want you to look at something
that's not on a television screen.

05:40.406 --> 05:43.273
-- How long ago did you get your tickets?
-- I haven't gotten them yet.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.936
--- Hey. -- You haven't
gotten them yet?

05:45.011 --> 05:47.810
I've got the box-office number right here.
I was just gonna call.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.747
Dana, the show is sold out.
You can't just get tickets.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.514
Don't be ridiculous, Isaac.
It's a children's show.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.179
Ah,
call the box office.

05:55.254 --> 05:57.450
-- Look, I...
-- Call them.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.549
<i>[ Clears throat]</i>

[Dialing]

06:02.762 --> 06:04.355
[Ringing]

06:04.430 --> 06:06.262
Hi, I'd like
two of your best seats

06:06.332 --> 06:07.925
for this afternoon's
matinee --

06:08.000 --> 06:10.662
anything between the 8th and
the 12th rows in the center,

06:10.737 --> 06:12.501
and if I end up
with an obstructed view,

06:12.572 --> 06:14.904
you're going to have a very
angry woman on your hands.

06:14.974 --> 06:15.964
Yes.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.032
Yes.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.271
What's he saying?

06:18.344 --> 06:20.711
It's tough to tell.
He's laughing pretty hard.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.748
Now he's telling
his friends.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.749
And, there,
he just hung up.

06:24.817 --> 06:25.841
Screwed?

06:25.918 --> 06:27.147
Totally screwed.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.154
[Chuckles]
Take them.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.212
What's this?

06:30.289 --> 06:32.451
Two tickets
to "The Lion King."

06:32.525 --> 06:34.619
How --
How did you know that --

06:34.694 --> 06:37.356
How did I know you've been
living in this city for 3 years

06:37.430 --> 06:39.956
and would still have no idea
where to take your niece?

06:40.032 --> 06:40.965
Yes.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.228
Lucky guess.

06:42.301 --> 06:43.928
These are wasted on me,
Isaac.

06:44.003 --> 06:46.131
You should give these
to a theater lover.

06:46.205 --> 06:47.570
You should become
a theater lover.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.074
Uh, I've tried.
I've really tried.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.576
But the singing
and the dancing,

06:50.643 --> 06:52.577
-- and there's oftentimes a hoedown.
-- There's no hoedown.

06:52.645 --> 06:55.307
Don't tell me there's no hoedown, mister.
I've been there.

06:55.381 --> 06:56.678
Enjoy the show.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.911
I'll enjoy it for my niece.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.976
Enjoy it for yourself.

07:04.657 --> 07:07.888
Nothing wrong
with a good hoedown.

-- They won't deliver.
-- They always deliver.

-- Well, not today.
-- Well, why not?

on Sixth Avenue,

-- Yeah.

07:41.727 --> 07:45.061
VVell, my portfolio is pretty much
tied up in food and shelter, Dan.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.496
I meant
your disposable income.

07:46.566 --> 07:48.864
I've got some extra money, and I
don't know what to do with it.

07:48.935 --> 07:50.562
Wow.
That must really suck.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.128
Yeah, it's a tough decision,
because when you're trying --

07:53.206 --> 07:54.867
All right,
I see what you're saying.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.807
<i>Thanks anyway.</i>

07:56.876 --> 07:57.900
AIDS.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.843
Yeah?

07:59.912 --> 08:02.074
Every once in a while,
if I have a few extra dollars,

08:02.148 --> 08:03.411
I'll give it
to an AIDS group.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.247
-- That's great.
-- It's only a little bit.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.810
-- A little is better than nothing.
-- I'll get you the name and address.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.322
The thing is, more people die of
breast cancer every year than AIDS.

08:10.389 --> 08:11.515
More people die
of diabetes.

08:11.591 --> 08:12.990
About 20 times as many die
of heart disease,

08:13.059 --> 08:15.289
but the government doesn't spend
as much money researching those.

08:15.361 --> 08:17.022
It's not that we shouldn't
be trying to cure AIDS.

08:17.096 --> 08:19.030
It's just we should be
trying to cure everything.

08:19.098 --> 08:22.033
And if I'm dying of leukemia, I might
well wonder where my red ribbon is.

08:22.101 --> 08:24.468
Why isn't someone throwing me
a pajama party at Barber's?

08:24.537 --> 08:26.699
Hey, just got off the phone
with Libby in Nepal.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.433
Corey is 1,500 feet
from the summit.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.809
Two guys have ascended
five miles into the sky.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.347
They walked up
a wall of ice

08:34.413 --> 08:37.110
and are preparing to knock on
the door of Heaven itself.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.277
There's really no end
to what we can do.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.683
You know what the trick is?

08:40.753 --> 08:42.551
-- What?
-- Get in the game.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.118
700 people have made
the summit.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.460
-- And how many have died trying?
-- One in four.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.761
Last year 15 died,

08:53.833 --> 08:56.427
and that's the most since
Hillary made it in '53.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.527
One in four die?

08:58.604 --> 08:59.571
Yeah.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.300
Let's get
that stat up front.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.172
Sure.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.540
What do they die from,
hypothermia mostly?

09:05.611 --> 09:08.273
Hypothermia,
sometimes a fractured skull.

09:08.347 --> 09:11.749
-- <i>From</i> what? -- <i>Falling very
far and landing on</i> a <i>rock.</i>

09:11.817 --> 09:13.046
Sure.

09:13.119 --> 09:15.588
Some of them die from something
called "cerebral edema."

09:15.655 --> 09:17.123
That's a high-altitude
sickness

09:17.189 --> 09:18.953
that leaves its victims
so disoriented

09:19.025 --> 09:20.754
they literally
can't save themselves.

09:20.826 --> 09:23.727
They sit there knowing if they don't
move they're gonna freeze to death,

09:23.796 --> 09:25.230
but they don't
do anything about it

09:25.298 --> 09:27.596
because their brain isn't giving
them enough oxygen to care.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.226
Huh.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.566
You think
you'd ever try it?

09:31.637 --> 09:32.729
-- Who, me?
-- Yeah.

09:32.805 --> 09:34.330
I'd have to get into shape.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.670
Well,
if you got into shape.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.176
-- I'd have to join your gym.
-- Got a Class Ill mountain.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.042
-- Would I climb Everest?
-- Yeah.

09:40.112 --> 09:41.580
Maybe.

09:41.647 --> 09:44.617
If I could do it right now, before
I really had anything to live for.

09:44.684 --> 09:46.652
What, you don't think you have
anything to live for?

09:46.719 --> 09:49.450
Sure, but not like you. You've
got a son and a great career.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.785
You've got stuff
to live for.

09:50.856 --> 09:53.450
Not as much as I'm hoping
I'll have to live for...

09:53.526 --> 09:56.257
Later...after I've lived
a little while longer.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.125
I see.

09:57.196 --> 09:59.130
Guys, this is that film
I was telling you about.

09:59.198 --> 10:02.190
-- It'll give you a good rundown of the
equipment fortheifinalassaufi. -- Thanks.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.430
Hey, stay here. I just want to get
that other stuff from my office.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.301
Sure.

10:06.372 --> 10:07.965
[Door closes]

10:08.040 --> 10:09.201
Hi.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.209
-- How you doin'?
-- Pretty good.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.745
-- Excellent.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

10:12.812 --> 10:14.780
Casey and I were just talking
about cerebral edema.

10:14.847 --> 10:15.837
-- Cool.
-- Yeah.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.440
-- This is ridiculous.
-- It's insane.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.450
We can't behave like this
with each other.

10:19.518 --> 10:21.111
I like you. You like me.
Everybody knows.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.712
Let's just go out
and be done with it.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.654
-- That's right. -- So what
if it's unprofessional.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.453
-- Do you think it's unprofessional?
-- I didn't say that.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.118
-- You did say that.
-- Yeah, but I didn't mean it.

10:28.194 --> 10:29.992
Look, we have to have
an understanding.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.757
At work we just work --
professionals --

10:31.831 --> 10:35.028
no furtive glances, no smiling at each
other, or flirting by the coffee.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.466
-- Right?
-- Absolutely.

10:38.270 --> 10:41.729
I think that's the trick. We just concentrate
on the show and leave the rest for after.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.002
-- I agree.
-- Good.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.142
I think we're gonna need
a new plan.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.581
Yes.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.982
I'll tell you this.

10:53.052 --> 10:56.488
Any small glimmer of a chance
that I was gonna climb Everest

10:56.555 --> 10:58.387
has completely vanished.

11:03.262 --> 11:05.424
[Knock on door]
Isaac, you got a second?

11:05.498 --> 11:06.966
Sure.
What's on your mind?

11:07.033 --> 11:09.434
[Sighs ] You make a lot of
charitable donations, don't you?

11:09.502 --> 11:10.298
I try.

11:10.369 --> 11:11.894
Who do you give
your money to?

11:11.971 --> 11:15.566
-- I used to donate money to the
Democratic Party. -- Not anymore?

11:15.641 --> 11:17.905
Well, you get your
heart broken enough times,

11:17.977 --> 11:19.069
you learn your lesson.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.512
Who do you give
your money to now?

11:21.580 --> 11:24.743
I give it here and there. There
are plenty of good causes.

11:24.817 --> 11:26.307
That's the problem.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.750
Hmm.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.983
Danny, every morning
I leave an acre and a half

11:31.057 --> 11:34.118
of the most beautiful
property in new canaan,

11:34.193 --> 11:38.289
get on a train and come to work
in a 54-story, glass high-rise.

11:38.364 --> 11:41.197
In between I step over
bodies to get here --

11:41.267 --> 11:43.201
20, 30, 50 of them a day.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.896
So as I'm stepping
over them,

11:44.970 --> 11:48.065
I reach into my pocket and
give them whatever I've got.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.630
You're not afraid they're
gonna spend it on booze?

11:49.709 --> 11:51.370
I'm hoping they're gonna
spend it on booze.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.435
Look, Danny, these people --
most of them --

11:53.512 --> 11:55.002
it's not like
they're one hot meal away

11:55.081 --> 11:56.480
from turning it around.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.984
For most of them, the clock
has pretty much run out.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.145
You'll be home soon enough.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.814
What's wrong with giving them a little
novocain to get them through the night?

12:03.889 --> 12:06.290
<i>Dana: Oh...my...God!</i>

12:06.358 --> 12:08.224
Have you two lived?

12:08.294 --> 12:10.319
-- Dana, what...
-- I don't think you've lived!

12:10.396 --> 12:12.922
I don't think you've lived
until you have seen this show!

12:12.998 --> 12:14.124
-- <i>You liked it?</i>
-- <i>Liked it?</i>

12:14.200 --> 12:16.897
-- I don't know where to start.
-- That's wonderful.

12:16.969 --> 12:18.835
<i>I honestly --
I don't know where to start.</i>

12:18.904 --> 12:21.236
Why don't you organize your
thoughts and get back to us.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.401
<i>The lights went out,</i>

12:23.476 --> 12:25.274
and this woman
with a voice like thunder --

12:25.344 --> 12:28.575
<i>this woman, she summons
all the animals of the jungle</i>

12:28.647 --> 12:31.673
to appear and honor the birth
of the new lion king.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.152
She summons the animals
with her voice,

12:34.220 --> 12:37.155
and do you know --
do you know what happens next?

12:37.223 --> 12:38.850
The animals appear?

12:38.924 --> 12:40.585
The animals appear.

12:40.659 --> 12:41.888
I got goose bumps.

12:41.961 --> 12:45.454
It was exactly where I was
meant to be at that moment.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.260
I gotta go tell
everybody!

12:47.333 --> 12:49.301
-- <i>Can I go tell everybody?</i>
-- Go <i>tell everybody.</i>

12:51.237 --> 12:53.137
-- Thank <i>you,</i> Isaac.
-- <i>You're welcome.</i>

12:53.205 --> 12:56.197
-- Thank <i>you for the tickets.</i>
-- <i>You're welcome.</i>

12:56.275 --> 12:58.403
Thank you for everything.

12:58.477 --> 13:00.775
Thank you for opening my eyes
to possibilities

13:00.846 --> 13:02.940
that would have gone
heretofore unexplored

13:03.015 --> 13:05.712
-- in a life that, while
ultimately -- -- Go, go.

13:07.419 --> 13:08.909
-- Kim!
-- Nobody's delivering.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.046
Nobody's delivering?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.214
Nobody's delivering.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.655
But we're in New York City.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.955
Yes, I know.
I recognize the big buildings.

13:15.027 --> 13:16.620
What about the kitchen?

13:16.695 --> 13:19.289
They took all the food out of
the kitchen to spray for bugs.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.335
Shouldn't there be some dead
bugs lying around I could eat?

13:22.401 --> 13:24.369
Casey, listen to
what happened to me.

13:24.436 --> 13:26.996
-- I'm looking for dead bugs.
-- I-| went to a show.

13:27.072 --> 13:28.733
Please tell me you have
milk duds in your purse.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.003
Don't you want to hear
what happened to me?

13:30.075 --> 13:31.406
Not unless you held up a deli
during intermission.

13:31.477 --> 13:35.004
I believe in the power
of the theater.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.138
Well, that's good.

13:36.215 --> 13:37.580
I believe in the power
of a roast beef sandwich,

13:37.650 --> 13:39.049
so I don't really have time
to talk.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.883
Casey...

13:41.954 --> 13:44.514
It was really
quite something.

13:45.791 --> 13:49.352
The music began,
and I just started to cry.

13:49.428 --> 13:52.193
I don't know
where it came from.

13:52.264 --> 13:53.857
It was like church.

13:53.933 --> 13:56.664
I didn't know
we could do that.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.669
[Laughs]

13:58.771 --> 14:01.536
Did you know
we could do that?

14:01.574 --> 14:04.976
Well, when I forget,
something usually reminds me.

14:08.247 --> 14:11.740
I didn't know
we could do that.

14:11.817 --> 14:15.253
...And the cold front, which seems to have
blanketed most of the Eastern seaboard,

14:15.321 --> 14:18.484
didn't seem to have an averse affect
on the Lions' offense this afternoon.

14:18.557 --> 14:19.718
Said Barry Sanders

14:19.792 --> 14:21.851
of his 240-yard,
3-touchdown performance,

14:21.927 --> 14:25.022
“Heck, on a lot of those runs I
was just trying to stay warm.“

14:25.097 --> 14:28.123
<i>That's all for this edition of "Sports
Night," but don't go too far.</i>

14:28.200 --> 14:30.965
Casey and I will be back at 2:00 AJVI.
to throw it to our team in Nepal

14:31.036 --> 14:32.629
for full coverage
of the Everest summit.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.264
By the way,
none of us here have eaten,

14:34.340 --> 14:36.570
so if you happen to be walking
by the building with a pizza --

14:36.642 --> 14:37.803
Dan!

14:37.877 --> 14:39.936
You've been watching
"Sports Night" on CSC.

14:40.012 --> 14:41.605
-- We'll see you later.
-- Good night.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.944
-- <i>We're out.</i>
-- <i>All right, let's get to it!</i>

14:44.016 --> 14:46.314
-- I'll be in Editing with Casey. --
That's the professional thing to do.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.547
-- And we're professionals. -- You
bet your sexy, little butt we are.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.248
I'll tell you what else.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.381
That wasn't my last
Broadway musical, either.

14:52.458 --> 14:53.983
I'm hooked.
Absolutely hooked.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.153
Chris, Will, Dave,
you guys like the theater?

14:56.228 --> 14:57.218
-- Love it.
-- Me, too.

14:57.296 --> 14:58.229
Will?

14:58.330 --> 14:59.422
It's not my cup of tea.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.796
That's what I used to say.

15:00.866 --> 15:03.426
The trick is you find the ones
without the hoedowns.

15:07.006 --> 15:08.701
<i>Before they'll climb
the mountain,</i>

15:08.774 --> 15:11.243
the Sherpas perform
a prayer ceremony, or puja,

15:11.310 --> 15:14.280
in which they ask the gods for
permission to climb so close.

15:14.346 --> 15:16.940
Maybe we shouldn't be trying
to climb so close, Jeremy.

15:17.016 --> 15:18.347
-- What do you mean?
-- Well...

15:18.417 --> 15:20.749
One in four people have died
trying to get up there.

15:20.819 --> 15:23.288
Yeah, but more people try to get up
there each year than the year before.

15:23.355 --> 15:25.084
The ancient mariners
used to think

15:25.157 --> 15:27.956
that if they sailed to the end of the ocean,
they'd fall into a fiery pit of dragons.

15:28.027 --> 15:31.190
Aviators thought that if they broke the sound
barrier, their planes would blow apart.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.027
One of these days
we might be right.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.862
-- VVell, not today. -- You
think they're gonna make it?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.299
If they don't,
somebody else will.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.359
What if the gods don't give
permission to climb so close?

15:38.437 --> 15:39.996
The gods can stick it.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.097
We're citizens
of this planet --

15:42.174 --> 15:44.199
George Mallory,
Edmund Hillary, Magellan,

15:44.276 --> 15:46.040
Balboa, Desmond Corey,
you and I --

15:46.111 --> 15:49.012
and I don't think anyone should
tell us how high we can climb.

15:50.249 --> 15:52.445
That's Mount Everest,
the highest peak on the planet.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.816
You see a lock on the door
and a "Do Not Disturb" sign?

15:54.887 --> 15:57.117
It's five miles of ice
straight up.

-- <i>Piece of cake.</i>

15:59.224 --> 16:00.885
I think I'm in love
with Natalie.

16:00.926 --> 16:02.087
Oh, that'll do it.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.788
Now let's get
back to work.

16:03.862 --> 16:05.193
[Wind howling]

16:05.264 --> 16:06.663
[Breathless]
Yeah.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.962
Yeah, yeah, right --
right there.

16:09.034 --> 16:11.969
We can, uh, --
we can see it now.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.506
That was the voice
of Desmond Corey.

16:14.573 --> 16:16.337
<i>You heard him say,
"We can see it."</i>

16:16.408 --> 16:18.467
I'm assuming he's referring
to the summit. Casey.

16:18.544 --> 16:19.909
Yeah, Dan.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.970
It's helpful to know
that the summit of Everest

16:22.047 --> 16:24.539
is much smaller than you
probably imagined,

16:24.616 --> 16:27.608
really no bigger than the top
of a dining room table.

16:27.686 --> 16:30.587
What can you tell us about
the flags that are behind you?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.090
These are prayer flags, Dan,

16:32.157 --> 16:34.216
left by different climbers
and Sherpas.

16:34.293 --> 16:36.887
The different flags signify
the different deities.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.863
<i>Mike, I understand that before
they'll attempt Everest,</i>

16:39.932 --> 16:41.923
the Sherpas perform
a prayer ceremony

16:42.001 --> 16:44.993
in which they ask permission
to tread so close to the gods.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.368
Casey, that's a ceremony
called a "puja,"

16:47.439 --> 16:50.374
and I promise you the climbers
take it very seriously.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.934
What happens
if permission is denied?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.538
What if the gods deem us
not worthy enough

16:55.614 --> 16:57.605
to climb up near them?

16:57.683 --> 16:59.208
[Wind howling]

17:00.686 --> 17:03.018
Mike?

17:03.088 --> 17:04.578
Libby, Mike, can you hear us?

17:04.656 --> 17:07.717
Yeah, Dan. It looks like
there's gonna be another hold.

17:07.792 --> 17:09.887
-- <i>Damn it!</i> -- <i>Libby, they
got</i> a <i>problem up there?</i>

17:09.962 --> 17:11.521
It's hard to say, Dan.

17:11.597 --> 17:14.531
Chances are they're probably
changing their oxygen tanks

17:14.599 --> 17:16.068
and discarding
the used ones.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.694
<i>They'll also want to do
a final equipment inventory</i>

17:18.771 --> 17:21.604
<i>and a situation assessment
before the final 50 feet or so.</i>

17:21.673 --> 17:22.867
How much more time?

17:22.941 --> 17:24.568
How long a wait
do you suppose we're in for?

17:24.643 --> 17:26.634
Probably not more
than 10 minutes or so.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.680
The window only stays open
for so long,

17:28.747 --> 17:30.442
so it's pretty much now
or never.

17:30.516 --> 17:31.608
We'll come back.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.117
We want them
to get this right,

17:33.185 --> 17:35.552
so while Desmond and his team
get ready for the summit,

17:35.621 --> 17:37.612
we're gonna return you
to regular programming.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.954
-- Stay tuned to CSC. We'll have the
summit in no time. -- Don't go far.

17:41.026 --> 17:42.050
We're out.

17:42.127 --> 17:43.891
-- Dana, are they gonna be okay?
-- Yeah.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.896
-- <i>You sure?</i>
-- <i>Yeah, they're gonna be fine.</i>

17:45.964 --> 17:48.456
Then could we possibly get
a large glazed ham in here?

17:48.534 --> 17:50.593
-- A <i>pot of beef stew?</i>
-- <i>We're trying.</i>

17:50.669 --> 17:52.398
How long does it take
to fix a water main?

17:52.471 --> 17:54.405
Why don't you go out there
and ask them?

17:54.473 --> 17:56.703
I would, but it's not fit
for man nor beast out there.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.436
<i>Hey, did you solve
your problem yet?</i>

17:58.544 --> 18:00.638
-- On how to be a guilt-free altruist?
-- Yeah.

18:00.679 --> 18:01.737
It's easier being a miser.

18:01.814 --> 18:03.248
-- Can I say something?
-- Sure.

18:03.315 --> 18:05.511
You're not gonna solve
everybody's problems.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.144
In fact, you're not gonna solve
anybody's problems.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.779
-- So you know what you should do?
-- What?

18:09.855 --> 18:10.845
Anything-

18:10.923 --> 18:12.914
As much of it
and as often as you can.

18:13.826 --> 18:17.262
-- I was right? -- VVhich is
surprising enough, but no.

18:17.329 --> 18:21.163

I don't know
if you can see,

20:05.370 --> 20:07.099

the peak of Mount Everest.
