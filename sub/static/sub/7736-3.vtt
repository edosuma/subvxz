<i>Tell Jesus your secret.</i>

00:17.844 --> 00:19.304
Uh-huh.

00:19.388 --> 00:21.181
Yes, that's very troubling.

00:22.140 --> 00:23.559
Thanks for calling me on a Sunday.

00:23.642 --> 00:27.101
I promise you, we will handle
this with Kevin immediately.

00:30.815 --> 00:33.610
<i>- Kevin, you lying sack of shit!
- What?</i>

00:33.694 --> 00:36.655

Bible Buddies after these messages.</i>

leads him to a cathouse.</i>

00:43.620 --> 00:46.456
<i>Beat it, gumshoe. I'm
trying to earn a living.</i>

00:46.540 --> 00:50.210
<i>- The world's oldest profession.
- Prostitution?</i>

00:50.293 --> 00:52.295
<i>- Smacking broads.
- Oh!</i>

00:54.089 --> 00:56.425
<i>Danger wears a D-cup.</i>

00:56.508 --> 00:59.394
<i>This week, on an all new Colt Luger.</i>

00:59.595 --> 01:00.887
I was watching that.

01:00.970 --> 01:02.681
No, you weren't. And now you're not.

01:02.764 --> 01:05.141
OK, little man, come on outside.

01:06.935 --> 01:09.145
- Yeah, Dad?
- How would you like to go

01:09.146 --> 01:11.356
to a football game in the
city with your old man?

01:11.439 --> 01:13.107
Wow, yeah!

01:13.733 --> 01:18.029
- I thought you were taking Kevin.
- Yeah, he's not going now.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.699
- When did he decide that?
- Just now when I told him.

01:20.782 --> 01:22.221
This shit took me all morning!

01:22.222 --> 01:23.660
You promised you were gonna take me!

01:23.743 --> 01:26.508
Well, you lied to me!
You gave me your word

01:26.543 --> 01:28.456
saying you were working on
those history assignments,

01:28.540 --> 01:30.249
and all of a sudden, I get
a call from your teacher

01:30.333 --> 01:31.710
saying you haven't done a single one!

01:31.793 --> 01:33.879
It's history!
It's not going anywhere!

01:33.962 --> 01:35.985
When I get home tonight, I want to see

01:35.986 --> 01:38.853
half of those assignments
completed, or as God is

01:38.854 --> 01:41.720
my witness, I will put you
through that fuckin' wall!

01:41.803 --> 01:44.723
We're outside, genius!
There is no wall!

01:44.806 --> 01:48.643
Then I will build one and I
will fucking put you through it!

01:48.727 --> 01:51.145
Would you please stop screaming

01:51.229 --> 01:53.313
in front of the entire neighborhood?!

01:54.190 --> 01:56.067
Don't worry, I didn't hear anything.

01:56.150 --> 01:59.029
<i>I heard, but I didn't understand it.</i>

01:59.111 --> 02:03.452
Sorry, Susan, but your son is no good.
You're not man enough

02:03.487 --> 02:05.911
to live up to your agreement,
so Bill gets to go to the game.

02:05.994 --> 02:09.247
That's final! He's a man.
He finished all his homework!

02:09.330 --> 02:11.666
- I didn't have any.
- Shut up and get in the car.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.168
And you get in the house!

02:18.423 --> 02:21.175
Hey, Frank.
You taking a Sunday drive?

02:21.259 --> 02:25.137
- Going to a game in the city, Vic.
- Oh, sweet, man.

02:25.221 --> 02:27.139
A boy and his dad
spending the day together,

02:27.223 --> 02:30.727
- that is some salt of the Earth stuff.
- Oh, I got tickets too!

02:30.810 --> 02:33.813
But I can't go, 'cause I
got one sick Izzie here.

02:33.897 --> 02:37.692
He got into by booger sugar, and
now he thinks he's a dinosaur.

02:37.776 --> 02:40.946
- Can you dig it? Crazy, man.
- Yeah, watch your toes.

02:45.450 --> 02:46.993
Rock on, my brother!

02:47.077 --> 02:50.496
That's it, Dad. Drive away
like a chickenshit dildo!

02:54.292 --> 02:57.045
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

02:57.127 --> 02:59.839
- That's what I thought.
- So unfair!

02:59.923 --> 03:03.885
- Well, Kevin, you made your bed.
- Not yet, but I will!

03:03.969 --> 03:07.430
- God, get off my back!
- Don't you talk to me that way!

03:07.513 --> 03:10.558
Now look who's screaming in
front of the whole neighborhood!

03:11.977 --> 03:13.519
Still didn't hear anything.

Stupid lipstick.

Look, honey, I know
you're upset at your dad.

04:11.953 --> 04:13.287
He's such a jerk.

04:13.371 --> 04:15.790
He's a bigger Hitler than
Mr. Hitler's brother, Hitler!

04:15.874 --> 04:18.125
- Wait, who?
- It's not fair!

04:18.209 --> 04:21.004
Kevin, you lied to us,
and you need to grow up.

04:21.087 --> 04:24.007
Look, Maureen and I are going
shopping, and while we're gone,

04:24.090 --> 04:26.425
I fully expect you to
get your assignments done.

04:26.509 --> 04:27.969
I'll see you in a few hours.

04:29.095 --> 04:29.971
Humph.

04:36.686 --> 04:38.938
I need to get toasted, now.

04:40.231 --> 04:42.108
<i> Billy, you are gonna love this.</i>

04:42.192 --> 04:44.318
You and me, the Murphy men.
You're excited, right?

04:44.402 --> 04:47.363
- Uh, sure, Dad.
- 'Course you are. This is incredible.

04:47.446 --> 04:50.449
Your first game and you're sitting on
the 50-yard line in corporate seats.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.472
Are you kidding me? At your age?

04:52.473 --> 04:54.412
<i>Do you realize how lucky you are?</i>

04:54.495 --> 04:57.123
<i>- Yeah.
- Jesus, I wish I had me for a dad.</i>

04:57.207 --> 05:00.292
Hey, grab me a cold one out
of the cooler. There you go.

05:00.376 --> 05:02.926
You're up, little man.
Hold the wheel.

05:06.007 --> 05:09.301
You're gonna love the stadium.
The field is so green!

05:09.385 --> 05:12.138
<i>And I got a great
shortcut to get us there.</i>

05:12.222 --> 05:15.810
Put the lock down.
I'll tell you, this is gonna be great.

05:18.561 --> 05:21.814
- Shouldn't we help that guy?
- No. Do not make eye contact.

05:21.898 --> 05:24.150
Hey, my main man. I ran outta gas.

05:24.234 --> 05:25.818
Don't make eye contact.

05:27.112 --> 05:30.656
- Can you help a brother out?
- Shit, I made eye contact.

05:30.740 --> 05:32.242
Don't kill me!
I have a family!

05:32.324 --> 05:34.786
<i>Fucking asshole!</i>

05:34.869 --> 05:37.622
Oh, what a day. I told you
it was gonna be great, huh?

05:37.705 --> 05:41.167
<i>Just you and me, buddy. This'll
be a day you will remember forever.</i>

05:53.345 --> 05:57.475
Oh, that looks so fun!
Why do I have to go with you?

05:57.558 --> 06:01.146
Stop pouting. You and I are
gonna have lots of fun today.

06:01.229 --> 06:02.772
We get to see the new mall,

06:02.855 --> 06:06.276
and buy supplies for
my Plast-A-Ware party.

06:06.358 --> 06:09.070
- Why?
- Because it's Mommy's job.

06:09.154 --> 06:12.031
Daddy says moms only work
when the husband's in jail.

06:12.115 --> 06:15.910
Daddy... sometimes says
things he doesn't mean.

06:15.994 --> 06:19.413
- And I love my job.
- How much money do you make?

06:19.497 --> 06:24.376
Well, they pay me in
free Plast-A-Ware bowls.

06:24.460 --> 06:29.548
- Is there money in the bowls?
- I better watch the road.

06:29.632 --> 06:32.093
<i> Wait till you see this.
You ready?</i>

06:32.177 --> 06:33.719
<i>- You ready?
- I'm ready.</i>

06:33.803 --> 06:36.597
- Here we go.
- Wow!

06:36.681 --> 06:39.391
Didn't I tell ya? It's a cathedral.

06:40.559 --> 06:44.135
<i>- Oh! Aren't these seats great?
- We're so close. </i>

06:44.170 --> 06:46.440
I can see the ash on the
quarterback's cigarette.

06:48.734 --> 06:50.987
Hey, you gonna tell your
friends about this tomorrow,

06:51.070 --> 06:52.738
about what a great old man you got?

06:52.822 --> 06:54.866
- Sure, Dad.
- Of course you will.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.285
- All right, Rustys!
- Whoo-hoo!

06:57.367 --> 06:59.912
Excuse me, but I believe
you're in my seats.

06:59.996 --> 07:02.874
Huh? No, no, no. These are
ours, pal. Keep it moving.

07:02.957 --> 07:04.834
Here, I'll show you the tickets.

07:04.917 --> 07:07.753
Get those outta my face.
These are company seats, pal.

07:07.837 --> 07:11.799
They belong to Mohican Airways.
Do you see that? Mohican Airways.

07:11.883 --> 07:13.926
Do you belong to Mohican Airways?

07:14.010 --> 07:18.764
I am Mohican Airways!
I'm Roger Dunbarton, the CEO.

07:18.848 --> 07:20.892
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, Mr. Dunbarton!

07:20.975 --> 07:24.354
Mr. Dunbarton, I'm so sorry.
Frank Murphy, baggage department.

07:24.436 --> 07:25.855
Take your hat off, Bill.

07:25.938 --> 07:28.233
Murphy, yes.
You recently got promoted.

07:28.316 --> 07:30.151
<i>Bob Pogo's been singing your praises.</i>

07:30.235 --> 07:34.030
That is when that whale isn't
singing the "Oscar Meyer Weiner Song."

07:36.615 --> 07:38.868
- Get out of my seats.
- Oh, yes. Yes, I'm sorry.

07:38.951 --> 07:41.412
I'm sorry. Bill, you're
in the man's seat.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.915
<i>Stopped on the
Piledriver 31-yard line.</i>

07:43.998 --> 07:47.960
Mr. Dunbarton, uh...
may I say it is an honor...

07:48.044 --> 07:50.462
- Dad, can I get a pennant?
- Yeah, yeah. Here you go. Get two.

07:50.546 --> 07:52.215
Mr. Dunbarton, can I buy you a beer?

07:52.298 --> 07:54.259
That horse piss is for peasants.

07:54.342 --> 07:57.136
On this side of the tracks,
we drink private stock.

07:57.220 --> 08:01.099
We're drinking brandy,
and my name is Brandy!

08:01.182 --> 08:05.186
- Isn't that funny?
- It's very funny, Brandy.

08:05.270 --> 08:08.439
- Yeah.
- It's hilarious.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.523
Right?

08:09.607 --> 08:14.862
Yes. Yes! Everyone laugh
at my wife's funny joke.

08:14.946 --> 08:16.655
Laugh, damn you!

08:16.739 --> 08:18.824
<i>Sit down!</i>

08:24.289 --> 08:25.748
Splifter time!

08:25.831 --> 08:29.335
Yah, mon, 
let's clean them ganja seeds

08:29.419 --> 08:32.337
before daylight comes
and me wanna go home.

08:32.422 --> 08:36.384
Where'd you get that queer
album from, your Dad's asshole?

08:36.467 --> 08:39.220
It's the first double album
I grabbed. Leave me alone.

08:39.304 --> 08:41.818
- Just busting you.
- When I was little,

08:41.852 --> 08:43.890
my parents put this on
every Sunday after dinner.

08:43.975 --> 08:46.477
Like they were Mr. and
Mrs. Liberace or some shit.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.772
Oh, you're bumming me out!
Let's blaze.

08:52.317 --> 08:54.610
My dad is such a hard-ass.

08:55.445 --> 08:58.072
He's breaking my balls
'cause I'm flunking history.

08:58.156 --> 09:01.700
Who needs to learn about
shit that already happened?

09:01.784 --> 09:04.912
If they had a class called
"future," I'd be all over it.

09:04.996 --> 09:08.333
Yeah, man. In the future,
you won't even have to study.

09:08.416 --> 09:09.750
You just take a smart pill.

09:11.002 --> 09:13.712
I would totally overdose on those.

09:20.136 --> 09:22.596
<i>Can you point me to
the bargain basement?</i>

09:22.680 --> 09:25.641
<i>I'm recently separated.
I don't think he ever loved me.</i>

09:25.724 --> 09:27.185
Oh, God, not her.

09:27.268 --> 09:29.687
Uh, Maureen, honey, let's go
play with the pots and pans.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.148
- Mommy, why are you pulling me?
- Sue?

09:32.231 --> 09:34.984
- Sue Murphy?
- Ah, fuck me.

09:35.067 --> 09:38.216
Ginny, hi!
It's so good to see you.

09:38.217 --> 09:40.696
- I'd love to talk, but...
- Oh, thank you.

09:40.731 --> 09:42.574
My own mother
won't even listen to me.

09:42.658 --> 09:45.244
Um...
honey, here's some pennies.

09:45.328 --> 09:47.497
Go make a wish in the fountain
in front of the organ store.

09:47.579 --> 09:49.290
All right!

09:49.374 --> 09:51.876
Thank you, Sue.
You're such a good friend.

09:51.959 --> 09:56.172
- Yes, well, I don't have a whole...
- It all began on the honeymoon.

09:56.365 --> 09:58.784
<i>And that's the end of the first half!</i>

09:58.867 --> 10:02.497
<i>The Piledrivers: 39,
your Rustys: two.</i>

10:02.580 --> 10:04.978
I don't want to brag,
sir, but since I took over

10:04.979 --> 10:07.376
the department, I already
found that stair car

10:07.377 --> 10:10.080
- that was missing since last fall.
- Good for you.

10:10.115 --> 10:12.298
You know, I once did a shift
in the baggage department

10:12.381 --> 10:14.842
just to see what it was like,
mix in with the fellas.

10:14.925 --> 10:18.095
- Really?
- Good God, no!

10:18.179 --> 10:20.433
Ah, it's a hell of a
thing that happened to Ed,

10:20.459 --> 10:22.475
- wasn't it, Frank?
- Oh, yeah. Terrible, terrible.

10:22.558 --> 10:26.103
Do you know how much it costs to
replace one of those propellers?

10:26.187 --> 10:28.564
- No.
- Neither did I, until Ed walked into one.

10:29.565 --> 10:31.859
You see, Frank, in business, it's the

10:31.860 --> 10:34.153
unforeseen expenses that
can cripple a company.

10:34.236 --> 10:37.739
Get that goddamn finger out of my face!

10:38.949 --> 10:41.243
- Dad, my soda!
- Nice throw, sir!

10:41.327 --> 10:44.372
Frank, the last thing this
company needs is a strike.

10:44.455 --> 10:46.686
When will these employees
learn that we're

10:46.687 --> 10:48.917
- all pulling together?
- Uh, there's a lot of factors, sir,

10:49.001 --> 10:51.128
and these guys, you know,
they work really hard.

10:51.212 --> 10:53.505
Now listen to me. You're
not their friend anymore,

10:53.506 --> 10:55.799
you're their boss!
They need to fear you.

10:55.883 --> 10:59.338
They need to know that you can fuck
their wife better than they can.

10:59.512 --> 11:01.597
- OK.
- I like you, Frank.

11:01.681 --> 11:04.183
- Just don't ever cross me.
- I would never do that, sir.

11:04.266 --> 11:06.810
Good. I think that God,
in His infinite wisdom,

11:06.894 --> 11:09.793
fed Ed's face into that
propeller so that you would

11:09.794 --> 11:12.692
be in this football
stadium on this day with me.

11:12.774 --> 11:14.860
You have been anointed, Frank.

11:14.943 --> 11:18.155
Don't let me, or God, down.
Same thing.

11:18.239 --> 11:21.617
- Dad, will you take me to the bathroom?
- Not now, I'm being anointed.

11:21.701 --> 11:25.580
- I really have to go.
- I'll take him. Follow me.

11:25.663 --> 11:28.832
Don't buy a hot dog, Brandy.
You're gettin' fat.

11:30.543 --> 11:33.962
- Oh, you.
- I mean it. I'll cut you off!

11:38.342 --> 11:41.429
Fuck him, I'll eat what I want!

11:50.854 --> 11:52.856
<i>What a dick!</i>

11:52.940 --> 11:54.816
<i>Shit-cock!</i>

11:54.900 --> 11:55.817
Ugh.

11:55.901 --> 11:58.153
<i>Fuck that guy!</i>

11:58.237 --> 11:59.779
<i>Bullshit.</i>

11:59.863 --> 12:02.324
<i>- Hey, move it.
- ...my fuckin' dick...</i>

12:02.408 --> 12:03.451
<i>Goddamn stall!</i>

12:03.534 --> 12:06.078
<i>- Hey, man, you're taking too long.
- I'm taking a shit!</i>

12:06.161 --> 12:08.205
<i>- Who pissed on this?!
- Should've gone for it.</i>

12:53.959 --> 12:57.379
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

13:02.677 --> 13:07.931
I have a question. If you had to
screw a First Lady, who would it be?

13:08.015 --> 13:11.393
- I know.
- And you can't say "Jackie Kennedy."

13:11.477 --> 13:13.813
If I can't say "Jackie Kennedy," I quit.

13:13.895 --> 13:17.941
- She's so sad.
- Stupid record.

13:27.785 --> 13:30.454
- Let's play catch, Daddy.
- You betcha, Kevin.

13:41.965 --> 13:43.925
<i>Remember this wonderful day,</i>

13:44.009 --> 13:45.990
<i>because there might be
a time when you're older</i>

13:45.991 --> 13:47.971
<i>and we're not getting along so good,</i>

13:48.055 --> 13:50.516
<i>and you'll remember that the
most important thing in life</i>

13:50.599 --> 13:52.476
<i>is that I'll always be your father.</i>

13:52.560 --> 13:55.187
<i>And I'll always love
you, no matter what.</i>

13:55.270 --> 13:57.565
<i>Oh, and you don't want
to be with Jackie Kennedy</i>

13:57.648 --> 13:59.692
<i>because she was married
to President Kennedy,</i>

13:59.775 --> 14:01.557
<i>and he fucked everybody.</i>

14:02.444 --> 14:06.407
I love you, Daddy.
I'm sorry things got so messed up.

14:06.490 --> 14:08.826
Kevin's tripping!

14:10.202 --> 14:12.162
I gotta get my act together.

14:12.246 --> 14:13.748
Starting right...

14:13.831 --> 14:16.625
- The cops!
- Oh, let's get outta here!

14:18.377 --> 14:21.547
No woman should spend
Valentine's Day night driving

14:21.548 --> 14:24.717
all over the city,
searching for her husband.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.968
Wow, it's five o'clock and...

14:27.052 --> 14:30.999
We hadn't had sex facing
each other for seven years.

14:31.752 --> 14:32.878
<i>Dad, I'm cold.</i>

14:32.961 --> 14:35.338
I need the window down.
It helps me think.

14:35.422 --> 14:38.800
Ah! Wasn't this a great day?
We had fun together, right?

14:38.884 --> 14:41.011
Yeah. You spent a lot of
time with the grown-ups.

14:41.095 --> 14:43.680
No, no, no, those weren't
just any grown-ups, son.

14:43.764 --> 14:47.351
I made a powerful friend today.
Do you know who that...

14:47.386 --> 14:48.393
Do you know who that Mr. Dunbarton is?

14:48.476 --> 14:52.147
That is the owner of Mohican
Airways. The big chief.

14:52.231 --> 14:53.857
A man to be reckoned with.

14:53.941 --> 14:56.151
He spent the last quarter
sleeping in his wife's lap.

14:56.235 --> 14:59.258
And now he knows who I
am, and he's trusting your

14:59.259 --> 15:02.282
father to smooth over this
whole strike situation.

15:02.365 --> 15:06.349
I'm important.
I have been anointed...

15:06.411 --> 15:09.664
<i> ...a titan of transportation!</i>

15:17.422 --> 15:20.300
Ah, shit.
Did your mother drive this?

15:24.679 --> 15:27.348
- Oh! Roll the windows up, Bill.
- I thought you needed to think.

15:27.432 --> 15:29.601
I'm done thinking! Roll them up!

15:29.684 --> 15:31.770
Oh, man! I don't want to go to juvie!

15:31.853 --> 15:33.438
My mom is gonna kill me!

15:33.521 --> 15:35.816
It's hard to run! I can't feel my feet!

15:36.399 --> 15:38.293
Come on, let's go!

15:39.611 --> 15:41.529
Uh, hey. I gotta go back.

15:41.613 --> 15:43.865
- You what?
- I left my wallet there.

15:43.949 --> 15:46.618
So I gotta go back for it.
Wait for me here.

15:48.120 --> 15:52.124
Oh, shit! Son of a bitch!

15:56.503 --> 15:58.713
Oh, where is it?

16:02.092 --> 16:03.760
- Hey! Come over here!
- Shit!

16:06.180 --> 16:09.516
Oh, come on!
I just need gas, have a heart!

16:09.599 --> 16:11.601
I fought in Korea!

16:11.685 --> 16:14.771
- Get outta the road!
- Ah, fuck you, lady!

16:14.855 --> 16:16.982
Dad, maybe we should
walk to a gas station.

16:17.065 --> 16:18.650
I saw one a few blocks back.

16:18.733 --> 16:20.568
Bill, this isn't a
good neighborhood, OK?

16:20.652 --> 16:23.780
Five blocks here is like
a thousand in our neighborhood.

16:23.864 --> 16:26.241
Christ, we'd be better off
drilling into the ground.

16:26.325 --> 16:29.397
- Yo, Frank. Frank Murphy!
- Rosie?

16:29.432 --> 16:30.871
What the hell are you doing down here?

16:30.954 --> 16:33.790
Oh, you know, we were just
coming from the game and...

16:33.874 --> 16:36.877
Man, get your Irish ass inside
before you freeze.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.547
Hey, go to Texaco and get my
friend some gas, all right?

16:40.630 --> 16:42.841
You guys come on in.

16:42.924 --> 16:45.510
When the fuck did I become the gas guy?

16:45.593 --> 16:47.512
Hey, get this man some coffee.

16:47.595 --> 16:50.401
Yo, kid, the bathroom's
over there if you need it.

16:51.474 --> 16:52.600
I'm OK.

16:52.684 --> 16:55.770
Hey, Rosie, why'd you
bring that cracker in here?

16:55.854 --> 16:57.689
Relax, he's cool man, he's cool.

16:57.772 --> 17:01.609
<i>- Shit, man, dude look like a cop!
- They all look like cops!</i>

17:04.029 --> 17:06.698
Yeah, I guess we do.
Everybody put your hands up!

17:12.954 --> 17:14.580
Not in here, Frank.

17:14.664 --> 17:18.001
<i>Waterbridge Mall is now closing.
Thank you.</i>

17:18.835 --> 17:22.130
I tried so hard to please him.
I did everything he asked.

17:22.214 --> 17:24.790
I cut my hair short,
I put on aftershave,

17:24.791 --> 17:28.220
- but he wouldn't touch me.
- I... I don't know, Ginny.

17:28.303 --> 17:33.267
- I even put a hot quarter up his ass.
- Ginny, stop! The mall is closing.

17:33.350 --> 17:35.560
I've got to find Maureen
and go home and make dinner.

17:35.643 --> 17:39.126
Oh. Well, excuse me.
I am so sorry that my

17:39.127 --> 17:42.609
life falling apart
has inconvenienced you.

17:42.692 --> 17:43.818
Ginny...

17:43.902 --> 17:45.862
Why'd I even bother
talking to you at all?

17:45.946 --> 17:49.408
You can't understand how I feel,
with your perfect life.

17:49.490 --> 17:53.912
- And your beautiful kids.
- My life isn't perfect, okay?!

17:53.995 --> 17:56.915
Outside of being a wife and
a mother, I've got nothing!

17:56.998 --> 17:59.709
I sell plastic that I cry into!

17:59.793 --> 18:01.962
We've all got our shit to carry, Ginny!

18:02.045 --> 18:05.465
Sometimes I wish I'd never got married!

18:07.426 --> 18:10.220
Do you ever stop thinking of yourself?

18:13.807 --> 18:15.542
<i>Is that true, Mommy?</i>

18:16.017 --> 18:18.979
Put those coins back in the fountain.

18:23.566 --> 18:26.027
Dad, I don't see any
John Denver records.

18:26.111 --> 18:29.697
Just keep looking, kid...
about 100 blocks North of here!

18:32.242 --> 18:34.286
This is an all-black neighborhood.

18:34.369 --> 18:37.998
So anyway, I had no sick days left.
No personal time, right?

18:38.081 --> 18:40.896
Frank Murphy covered my
whole shift so I could

18:40.897 --> 18:43.711
go to the hospital to
see my daughter be born.

18:43.795 --> 18:47.715
It was an honor, and I asked
nothing in return.

18:47.799 --> 18:50.260
So how's my little
goddaughter, Frankalina?

18:53.430 --> 18:55.807
- This guy!
- Ah, this guy!

18:55.890 --> 18:58.852
- I fucking love this guy!
- To Frank Murphy.

18:58.935 --> 19:01.562
Best friend a luggage jockey ever had.

19:01.646 --> 19:04.774
With you on our side,
man, Bob Pogo can take his

19:04.775 --> 19:07.902
cutbacks and shove 'em up
his fat, bacon-eatin' ass.

19:07.986 --> 19:10.300
- That's right, that's right!
- Yeah, and the football

19:10.301 --> 19:12.615
tickets he gave us
weren't that good anyway.

19:12.699 --> 19:15.285
- What, say what?
- Uh, nothing, nothing.

19:15.369 --> 19:17.662
Bob Pogo gave my dad the
corporate seats today,

19:17.745 --> 19:19.373
but we had to share
'em with Mr. Dunbarton.

19:19.456 --> 19:21.624
He likes my dad a lot.
Kept talking to him

19:21.625 --> 19:23.793
the whole time about
how to scare employees.

19:23.877 --> 19:26.867
- Dunbarton, huh?
- OK, yeah, yeah.

19:26.902 --> 19:30.675
Bob... Bob gave me the corporate
seats, but I had to take 'em.

19:30.758 --> 19:33.220
But I'm still with you. Meeting
Dunbarton gave me the chance

19:33.303 --> 19:35.722
to put a human face on the
baggage handlers' union.

19:35.805 --> 19:38.141
Which face am I talking to now?

19:39.476 --> 19:41.319
Your gas is here, man.

19:42.312 --> 19:43.813
You're welcome.

19:47.234 --> 19:48.651
<i>Hey!</i>

19:48.735 --> 19:52.447
It's your neighbor, Mr. Holtenwasser.

19:52.531 --> 19:55.367
Kevin, it is cold.
Let me take you home.

19:55.450 --> 20:00.872
- Thanks, but...
- Oh, please, I insist. Hop in.

20:06.044 --> 20:07.045
Whoa.

20:17.305 --> 20:20.350
Dad, are you mad at me
for telling your friend

20:20.351 --> 20:23.695
- about the tickets?
- Nah. It's my fault anyway.

20:24.145 --> 20:26.523
I'm sorry today didn't turn
out the way you'd hoped.

20:26.606 --> 20:29.650
It's OK.
Can I ask you something else?

20:29.734 --> 20:32.112
- 'Course you can.
- This strike thing at work,

20:32.195 --> 20:34.614
how can you be on the boss'
side and your friend's side?

20:36.199 --> 20:37.651
You can't.

20:38.910 --> 20:40.370
<i>Hang on, I'm not done yet.</i>

20:40.454 --> 20:43.123
- Well, didn't you go at the game?
- Hell, no!

20:46.126 --> 20:50.004
- Why'd you make me put the coins back?
- Because it was stealing.

20:50.088 --> 20:53.383
- But it was my wish.
- Well, not all wishes come true.

20:53.467 --> 20:56.261
Like your wish that
you never got married?

20:56.344 --> 20:59.139
No.
I didn't... No.

20:59.222 --> 21:02.934
That's not... I said that,
but I didn't really mean it.

21:03.017 --> 21:07.730
I was, you know, just trying
to make Ginny feel better.

21:07.814 --> 21:11.838
Oh. So when I heard Daddy
say he wished he never

21:11.839 --> 21:15.863
got married, who was he
trying to make feel better?

21:15.947 --> 21:18.492
I will be sure to ask him that.

21:18.575 --> 21:21.869
It's nice to finally
speak to you, Kevin.

21:21.953 --> 21:24.122
I've watched you grow for years.

21:24.205 --> 21:28.918
- What? Like, through the curtains or...
- On the street, at play.

21:29.002 --> 21:33.465
Did you know I was the first
homeowner in the subdivision?

21:33.548 --> 21:38.678
Well, me and my wife.
Her name was Mary.

21:38.761 --> 21:41.806
Was a nurse in the
U.S. Army hospital at...

21:42.432 --> 21:44.058
Holy shit, it's my dad!

21:44.142 --> 21:45.226
Shit!

21:45.310 --> 21:47.562
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

21:47.646 --> 21:50.315
<i>Have a wonderful evening!</i>

22:08.667 --> 22:11.169
There is something
I really need to ask you.

22:11.252 --> 22:14.214
Ah, Sue, for Christ sake.
I've had a hell of a day.

22:14.297 --> 22:16.757
Have you been drinking?
Has he been drinking?

22:16.841 --> 22:18.092
Don't make me snitch on him!

22:18.176 --> 22:20.428
- That means yes.
- Oh, give me a break.

22:20.512 --> 22:22.222
I was at a football game.
What do you want from me?

22:31.189 --> 22:34.775
Oh!
You back already?

22:35.860 --> 22:39.906
- Wow, you're really studying.
- Oh, yeah, sure am. Like crazy.

22:39.989 --> 22:41.991
Did you know there were two World Wars?

22:42.075 --> 22:46.705
- Huh. I haven't heard this music in...
- A very long time.

22:46.787 --> 22:50.791
- I always liked it, too.
- Why'd you play this now?

22:53.587 --> 22:55.004
Just wanted to hear something sucky.

22:55.088 --> 22:56.881
It's better than your
"Elfin King" bullshit!

22:56.964 --> 22:59.467
That is enough!
We love each other!

22:59.551 --> 23:02.637
We've been apart all day
and now we are

23:02.638 --> 23:05.724
gonna spend the evening
together, as a family.

23:05.806 --> 23:07.808
<i>Bobby, I asked you to mow the lawn.</i>

23:07.892 --> 23:09.436
<i>I did mow the lawn, Dad.</i>

23:09.519 --> 23:12.230
<i>But the grass is just
as high as it was, Bobby.</i>

23:12.313 --> 23:15.734
<i>Oh, golly!
You meant mow our lawn!</i>

23:15.816 --> 23:17.110
<i>Bobby!</i>

23:17.944 --> 23:19.696
Hey, guess what I found out today?

23:19.778 --> 23:22.823
We were all wrong about our
neighbor, you know, Mr. Hitler?

23:22.907 --> 23:23.866
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

23:23.950 --> 23:26.119
He's not a Nazi.
He's got one of those

23:26.120 --> 23:28.288
weird stars hanging
from his rearview mirror.

23:28.371 --> 23:31.207
- He's a Satan worshiper!
- Holy crap!

23:31.291 --> 23:34.294
- Pretty great, huh?
- Hey! I spent 700 bucks on a TV

23:34.377 --> 23:37.130
so I could watch a family
being happy. So zip it.

23:44.679 --> 23:46.640
<i>Tonight, I unveil the first</i>

23:46.723 --> 23:51.060
<i>of my six-part series:
To Be Black In Today's America.</i>

23:51.144 --> 23:54.522
<i>I witnessed firsthand the
silent scourge of racism as,</i>

23:54.606 --> 23:56.691
<i>disguised as a typical
inner-city Negro,</i>

23:56.775 --> 24:00.361
<i>I tried in vain to find
help for my disabled vehicle.</i>

24:00.445 --> 24:04.532
<i>Not a single Caucasian driver
stopped to assist me, a black man.</i>

24:04.616 --> 24:08.035
<i>Hey, my main man, I ran outta gas.
Can you help a brother out?</i>

24:08.119 --> 24:09.912
<i>Don't kill me, I have a family!</i>

24:09.996 --> 24:14.709
<i>There you have it: the face
of racism in America today.</i>

24:14.793 --> 24:17.003
Man, you think you know a guy.

24:17.086 --> 24:20.839
Oh, this day gets
curiouser and curiouser.

24:21.633 --> 24:25.052
Hey, it's me. We can't trust
Frank Murphy to help us out.

24:25.136 --> 24:27.930
It's time for the union
to set a strike date.

24:28.598 --> 24:32.059
No, obviously, I don't
know what time it is!
