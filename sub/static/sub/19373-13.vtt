WEBVTT

00:11.010 --> 00:12.110
That's it.

00:12.111 --> 00:12.981
You're doing great.

00:12.979 --> 00:15.679
You've almost earned
your next snowboarding badge.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.252
Whoa.
Almost there, jake.

00:18.251 --> 00:21.851
Okay, now turn and do
the new stop I taught you.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.285
Whoa.
Whoops.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.290
Whoa.

00:26.292 --> 00:27.632
(sighing)

00:27.627 --> 00:28.857
Ah, don't worry, alex.

00:28.862 --> 00:32.631
Everybody falls
when they're learning.

00:32.631 --> 00:35.232
Look out below!

00:35.235 --> 00:38.865
I'll never snowboard
like daring danny x.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.772
He's extra awesome.

00:43.610 --> 00:44.840
Wow!

00:44.844 --> 00:46.244
Did you see that move?

00:46.246 --> 00:50.646
Uh, actually, no.
But keep practicing, alex,

00:50.650 --> 00:53.850
And you'll be
even better than danny.

00:57.357 --> 01:01.127
It sure was nice of jake to
invite us to stay at his lodge.

01:01.127 --> 01:06.057
Yeah. He even got us
the new pup-pup boogie game.

01:06.065 --> 01:08.325
And you guys are great at it.

01:08.334 --> 01:11.174
Why don't you try, everest?

01:11.170 --> 01:14.140
Uh, I've never played before.

01:14.140 --> 01:17.810
Just follow the steps
up on the screen.

01:17.810 --> 01:20.040
But those moves look
so fast.

01:20.046 --> 01:23.376
Then just watch me
and do what I do.

01:25.318 --> 01:28.388
Left, left, right.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.188
Aah!
Oops.

01:30.189 --> 01:31.319
Sorry, marshall.

01:31.324 --> 01:34.134
I guess I just need
a lot more practice.

01:34.127 --> 01:37.957
That's okay, everest.
You'll get it.

01:37.964 --> 01:38.864
Hey, what's this?

01:38.865 --> 01:43.125
It must be something
for the game.

01:44.804 --> 01:46.644
They look like bracelets.

01:46.639 --> 01:50.109
It says they're the newest thing
in pup-pup boogie:

01:50.109 --> 01:52.639
I-do-you-do bracelets.

01:52.645 --> 01:53.375
"how to use:

01:53.379 --> 01:55.349
"wear one set of bracelets

01:55.348 --> 01:58.718
"and have a friend wear
the other set.

01:58.718 --> 02:02.118
Activate the switch
to turn them on."

02:03.356 --> 02:05.686
Now what?

02:05.692 --> 02:09.991
Hey, my head moved
and I didn't even do it.

02:09.996 --> 02:13.226
Now, let's try
a back flip.

02:13.232 --> 02:14.702
Wow!
I get it.

02:14.701 --> 02:19.041
That's why they're called
I-do-you-do bracelets.

02:19.038 --> 02:22.238
'cause whatever I do,
you do.

02:22.241 --> 02:24.011
Get ready to boogie.

02:27.780 --> 02:29.910
Everest, you're doing it.

02:29.916 --> 02:32.116
Huh?
Oh, yeah.

02:32.118 --> 02:34.848
I am doing at without trying.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.124
It's kind of strange.

02:36.122 --> 02:41.262
I didn't know you could
pup-pup boogie, everest.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.790
I can't.

02:42.795 --> 02:48.065
Thanks, but skye, can we stop?

02:48.067 --> 02:48.727
Sure,

02:48.735 --> 02:51.295
But I thought your
pup-pup-boogieing was great.

02:51.304 --> 02:55.744
Well, you were, but I was
just doing what you were doing.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.782
I'd rather learn by practicing.

02:58.778 --> 03:01.808
Then I'll practice with you.
Come on.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.954
Shimmy-shimmy
tail-shake.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.750
Shimmy-shimmy
tail-shake.

03:07.954 --> 03:08.854
Hmm.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.715
Would it be okay
if I tried these?

03:10.723 --> 03:14.463
You going to learn how to
pup-pup-boogie, too, alex?

03:14.460 --> 03:16.130
Skye:
Excuse me, rocky.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.429
Could you please
restart the game?

03:18.431 --> 03:19.761
Sure, skye.

03:21.367 --> 03:25.167
I could pup-pup-boogie,
but these bands

03:25.171 --> 03:30.041
Could make me awesome
at something else, too.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.513
Check this out!

03:35.048 --> 03:36.508
Hi, danny.

03:36.516 --> 03:39.446
Whoa!
Oof.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.017
Only an expert boarder

03:43.022 --> 03:46.062
Can make an awesome-looking hole
like this.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.389
That's why I stopped you.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.463
I want to be as good
a snowboarder as you

03:49.462 --> 03:51.432
So I can get my next badge.

03:51.431 --> 03:54.071
That'll take a lot of practice.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.397
Not if I use these special
I-do-you-do bracelets.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.543
Huh?

03:58.538 --> 03:59.798
If we both put them on,

03:59.806 --> 04:01.336
Then whatever you do, I'll do.

04:01.340 --> 04:04.240
I can been expert
just like you.

04:04.243 --> 04:04.983
Okay.

04:04.977 --> 04:09.547
I mean, who wouldn't want
to snowboard like me?

04:10.349 --> 04:12.379
Let's do it.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.145
Whoa.

04:14.153 --> 04:17.223
My knees just bent
by themselves?

04:17.223 --> 04:18.293
Q-l.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.161
And now my thumb
is copying yours.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.460
Smart thumb.

04:22.462 --> 04:25.532
So, let's hit
the slopes.

04:29.435 --> 04:32.235
It's working.
I'm a pro!

04:32.238 --> 04:33.268
If you think that's cool,

04:33.272 --> 04:37.542
Check out this
daring danny x awesomeness.

04:37.543 --> 04:38.983
Whee!

04:38.978 --> 04:41.948
(giggling)

04:41.948 --> 04:45.318
Wahoo!

04:45.318 --> 04:46.118
Yes!

04:46.119 --> 04:50.019
You're as amazing as me,
and I'm truly amazing.

04:50.022 --> 04:53.492
Whoa!
I can't see.

04:53.493 --> 04:57.903
But I don't need to wipe
my face.

04:59.031 --> 05:02.171
(sighing)

05:02.168 --> 05:05.368
Uh-oh.

05:08.407 --> 05:12.177
Danny, alex, stop!

05:12.178 --> 05:15.578
You're headed for risky ridge.

05:15.581 --> 05:16.551
Stop.

05:16.549 --> 05:19.179
Oh, man.
There's no way they can hear me.

05:19.185 --> 05:21.845
I got to call the paw patrol.

05:21.854 --> 05:24.324
(phone ringing)

05:24.323 --> 05:25.993
Hiya, jake.

05:25.992 --> 05:26.492
What's up?

05:26.492 --> 05:28.462
<i> More like what's going</i>
<i> downhill fast.</i>

05:28.461 --> 05:31.501
<i> Alex and denny don't know it,</i>
<i> but they're snowboarding</i>

05:31.497 --> 05:33.557
<i> Right for risky ridge.</i>

05:33.566 --> 05:34.926
Don't worry, jake.

05:34.934 --> 05:37.904
No mountain is too high;
no pup is too small.

05:37.904 --> 05:42.944
Paw patrol,
to the paw patroller.

05:42.942 --> 05:45.342
Pups:
Ryder needs us.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.984
Whoa.

05:47.980 --> 05:50.410
(barking)

05:50.416 --> 05:53.176
Whoa!
Oof.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.616
Just thought I'd take a spin.

05:55.621 --> 06:00.021
(everyone laughing)

06:07.934 --> 06:11.644
Paw patrol ready for action,
ryder, sir.

06:12.905 --> 06:16.465
Ryder:
Danny and alex are snowboarding
towards risky ridge.

06:16.475 --> 06:20.305
This will be tricky 'cause
we need to save both of them.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.353
Whoa.
Double trouble.

06:22.348 --> 06:24.648
For this rescue, I'll need skye.

06:24.650 --> 06:27.350
Use your 'copter
to catch up to danny.

06:27.353 --> 06:29.353
This puppy has got to fly.

06:29.355 --> 06:32.185
Rocky, you'll ride
in skye's harness

06:32.191 --> 06:33.921
And grab danny with your cloth.

06:33.926 --> 06:35.056
Green means go.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.961
Everest, you're our fastest pup
on the snow.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.455
While rocky and skye
rescue danny,

06:40.466 --> 06:43.126
We'll need you to use
your snowboard to stop alex.

06:43.135 --> 06:46.165
Ice or snow, I'm ready to go.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.472
Paw patrol
is on a roll.

06:48.474 --> 06:50.014

Look.

07:42.061 --> 07:43.391
You're right, jake.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.596
Let's go, team.

07:44.597 --> 07:46.557
Skye, drop your claw.

07:46.565 --> 07:50.225
You got it.
Claw!

07:50.236 --> 07:52.036
(whirring)

07:52.038 --> 07:53.768
In you go, rocky.

07:53.773 --> 07:55.413
I'm ready.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.768
Okay, skye.
Take off.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.736
This puppy
has got to fly.

07:59.745 --> 08:01.445
This one, too.

08:01.447 --> 08:05.247
Everest, use your snowboard
and catch up with alex.

08:05.251 --> 08:08.091
I'm on it.

08:10.756 --> 08:12.456
Whoa, whoa.
Hey!

08:12.458 --> 08:15.058
There aren't supposed to be
moguls on this hill.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.791
What?
Whoa!

08:16.796 --> 08:19.056
Whoa-oa!

08:20.633 --> 08:22.673
Phew.
We're okay.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.768
Hey, guys.

08:24.770 --> 08:25.770
Danny--
what?

08:25.771 --> 08:28.371
You've got to stop.
You're headed for a cliff.

08:28.374 --> 08:31.344
I don't see a cliff,
and it's daring danny--

08:31.344 --> 08:32.784
Whoa!

08:32.778 --> 08:34.138
Hang on, alex.

08:34.145 --> 08:35.706
Everest is on her way
to help you.

08:35.715 --> 08:38.674
Danny, I'm going to
grab you with my claw.

08:38.683 --> 08:40.654
Whoa.
Claw.

08:41.787 --> 08:45.257
Hey, I was supposed to grab you.

08:45.257 --> 08:46.387
(screaming)

08:46.392 --> 08:49.692
Hey, one rider per board.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.825
Help!

08:50.830 --> 08:52.400
I'm trying, alex,

08:52.398 --> 08:55.368
But stop waving your hands
for second.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.728
I can't.

08:56.736 --> 09:00.766
Hey, you've got
the I-do-you-dos on.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.143
Ryder, come in.

09:02.141 --> 09:02.871
What is it, everest?

09:02.875 --> 09:04.835
<i> Alex is wearing</i>
<i> the I-do-you-do.</i>

09:04.844 --> 09:07.244
<i> I think that's why</i>
<i> he's so out of control.</i>

09:07.246 --> 09:10.546
The I-do-you-dos?
From the pup-pup boogie game?

09:10.549 --> 09:13.579
Wait.
If alex is wearing bracelets,

09:13.586 --> 09:17.186
Who's wearing the other ones?

09:17.189 --> 09:18.689
Daring danny x.

09:18.691 --> 09:22.161
So, if we get the bracelets
off danny,

09:22.161 --> 09:24.561
Alex can stop himself, right?

09:24.563 --> 09:25.303
For sure.

09:25.297 --> 09:27.457
I taught him a new way
to do that this morning.

09:27.466 --> 09:29.396
Everest, keep an eye on alex.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.372
I have a plan.
Come in, rocky.

09:32.371 --> 09:33.441
<i> I hear you, ryder.</i>

09:33.439 --> 09:35.409
Danny is wearing
the I-do-you-dos.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.838
<i>You've got to get them</i>
<i> off him.</i>

09:37.843 --> 09:39.913
I'm on it.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.518
Hey.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.690
I'm moving like me again.

09:49.688 --> 09:52.488
Uh-oh!
I'm going way too fast.

09:52.491 --> 09:56.761
But you can stop.
Jake told us you learned how.

09:58.864 --> 10:01.604
I did it.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.600
(screaming)

10:02.601 --> 10:04.871
Skye, rocky needs you.

10:04.870 --> 10:08.710
On my way.

10:08.707 --> 10:11.607
Both:
Whoa!

10:11.610 --> 10:13.210
Grab on, rocky.

10:13.212 --> 10:15.412
And you grab onto me.

10:15.414 --> 10:17.454
Both:
Whoa.

10:18.751 --> 10:21.921
What an epic ride.

10:21.921 --> 10:26.661
Whenever you have a problem,
danny, just yelp for help.

10:26.659 --> 10:27.889
Did you see me stop, jake?

10:27.893 --> 10:30.693
I sure did,
little dude.

10:30.696 --> 10:31.956
Ah, like a pro.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.234
No more I-do-you-do help for me.

10:34.233 --> 10:37.373
I'm going to get my next
snowboard badge on my own.

10:37.369 --> 10:40.739
Just like how I'm going to learn
pup-pup boogie.

10:40.739 --> 10:44.339
Pup-pup what?

10:47.847 --> 10:51.677
Pup-pup boogie is awesome.
