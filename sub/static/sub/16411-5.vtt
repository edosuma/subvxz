(voice mail):
Hi. You've reached Anja,

00:43.750 --> 00:45.375
and you're probably
my mom, dad or grandma,

00:45.375 --> 00:46.834
so just feel free
to leave a message

00:46.834 --> 00:48.792
and I'll get back to you
when I can. Thanks.
(beep)

00:48.792 --> 00:51.667
Woman (over phone):
Anja, I wish you'd change
your outgoing message.

00:51.667 --> 00:53.333
It's not very professional.

00:53.333 --> 00:56.291
How do you know it's me,
dad, or Noni calling?
(Anja coughs)

00:56.291 --> 00:57.917
Anyway, I sent this
in an e-mail,

00:57.917 --> 01:00.291
that the woman you should call
is Barbara Horne.

01:00.291 --> 01:02.208
H-O-R-N-E.

01:02.208 --> 01:05.291
She's been at the top
of God knows how many
publications

01:05.291 --> 01:07.208
and she's the real
deal, honey. All right?

01:07.208 --> 01:09.375
I told her about
your NYU column.

01:09.375 --> 01:12.041
She's expecting your call,
so call her please.

01:12.041 --> 01:14.959
Do not e-mail.
But like I said,

01:14.959 --> 01:16.458
just see if you can
take her to lunch,

01:16.458 --> 01:17.917
pick her brain,
whatever.

01:17.917 --> 01:21.000
She's kind of a pain in the ass,
but, you know, she's very major.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.959
Uh, anyway, there you go.

01:22.959 --> 01:25.291
You're welcome.
Um, what else?

01:25.291 --> 01:26.750
Uh, not much
happening over here.

01:26.750 --> 01:30.291
Dad and I walked
down to the lake
with Rosie this morning.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.792
She had a tough time.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.000
I think we're gonna
have to put her down soon

01:34.000 --> 01:35.667
so of course,
Daddy's a wreck.

01:35.667 --> 01:37.875
But if you want to see her,
you should come visit.
Ow, ow,

01:37.875 --> 01:38.834
ow.

01:38.834 --> 01:40.875

Uh, I just kind of bike around
and, uh, people call me

I bring them weed
pretty much.

06:42.250 --> 06:43.834

there is to it.

that's because you're white?

Oh, shit.

07:14.458 --> 07:16.583

yeah, I guess

07:16.583 --> 07:19.166
it has something
to do with it.
Yeah, maybe.

07:19.166 --> 07:22.667
But, you know, it's also maybe
'cause I'm small potatoes

07:22.667 --> 07:25.000
and, uh, I just deal
a little weed...
Yeah.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.667
...and sometimes mushrooms,
so I'm not really...
Oh. Okay.

07:27.667 --> 07:29.208
So mushrooms as well?

07:29.208 --> 07:31.500
Yeah, I'm not really
on their radar.
Yeah.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.542
Okay. Yeah.

07:33.542 --> 07:34.959
What about your, um,

07:34.959 --> 07:35.959
client list?

07:35.959 --> 07:39.041
Are they mostly
white as well, like you?

07:39.041 --> 07:43.041
Well, uh, yeah,
most of them are white actually.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.041
Yeah?
Now that I think about it.
I haven't really thought

07:45.041 --> 07:47.375
about it before.
There's... There's some...

07:47.375 --> 07:49.458
No, there's more
than a few non-white customers.

07:49.458 --> 07:53.166
Why do you think that
most of your clients are white?

07:53.166 --> 07:56.375
Hey, so what's with
all the racial questions?

07:56.375 --> 07:59.375
Well, it's just that a...
a disproportionate amount

07:59.375 --> 08:02.417
of people in prison
for marijuana offenses are...

08:02.417 --> 08:03.792
are non-white,

08:03.792 --> 08:06.166
and I thought you might have
something to say about that.

08:06.166 --> 08:07.708
I mean, that's cool.
I understand.

08:07.708 --> 08:11.875
It's important, but, uh,
just, uh, off the record,

08:11.875 --> 08:13.333
when I sat down
to do this,

08:13.333 --> 08:15.708
you said you wanted me
to tell you some fun stories

08:15.708 --> 08:19.250
about dealing weed,
and not, uh...
Mm-hmm.

08:19.250 --> 08:20.708
...race politics.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.041
Yeah, I know, I know.
So like, just a heads up,
you know?

08:23.041 --> 08:24.750
I'm sor--
It's just that, um...

08:24.750 --> 08:28.500
I feel like there's
a bigger point that we--

08:28.500 --> 08:29.959
You know, like, it's just--

08:29.959 --> 08:33.583
I'm trying to focus on, like,
the, um, intersectionality

08:33.583 --> 08:37.792
of, like, race and pot
in a post-prohibition era.

08:37.792 --> 08:40.083
And we will get
to the anecdotes. Um...

08:40.083 --> 08:43.750
I just felt like I would be
remiss as an interviewer

08:43.750 --> 08:47.125
if I didn't cover
this very important
part of the subject.

08:47.125 --> 08:50.041
Like blacks in Iowa
are 8.3% more likely

08:50.041 --> 08:52.750
to get arrested for...
for possession and dealing

08:52.750 --> 08:54.375
than-- than bla--
than whites.

08:54.375 --> 08:56.041
And, and I just...
I felt like

08:56.041 --> 08:58.333
it was important
to highlight how race

08:58.333 --> 09:00.750
might affect
your experience
of your job.

09:00.750 --> 09:01.917
It is important.
Yeah.

09:03.917 --> 09:05.792

actually just...

uh, excuse me
for a second?

09:07.959 --> 09:09.375

09:09.375 --> 09:11.000

09:11.000 --> 09:13.291

09:30.208 --> 09:32.250

who you are.

09:32.250 --> 09:34.041

09:37.708 --> 09:40.750

12:37.291 --> 12:38.959
Mm, it's so good, in fact.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.458
Mm.
Mm.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.500
Morning.
Good morning.

12:42.500 --> 12:43.708
Mm.

12:43.708 --> 12:45.750
Don't go to work.
Oh, I know.

12:45.750 --> 12:48.625
I don't want to, but I...
want to marry you right now.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.041
No, not yet.
Wanna get married right now?

12:50.041 --> 12:52.000
No, not yet.
I gotta wait?
Okay, I'll wait.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.375
I gotta go. Mm. Love you.

12:53.375 --> 12:54.792
Bye.
Bye.

13:00.375 --> 13:02.750
Hey, Nihal, are we still
going to Marta

13:02.750 --> 13:05.083
for the black truffle pizza?

13:05.083 --> 13:06.041
Hell yeah!

13:06.041 --> 13:07.667
Brenda made us
a rezzie for eight.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.000
Love ya!

13:09.000 --> 13:11.834
Love you.

Now, using a dating app
to find romance

13:14.000 --> 13:17.041
may have become
the norm for finding love
in the modern age,

13:17.041 --> 13:20.041
but this next fall comedy
might have you think twice

13:20.041 --> 13:21.375
before swiping right.

13:21.375 --> 13:23.041
It's called
"Homeless Helga"
and it stars

13:23.041 --> 13:26.000
"Orange Is the New Black's"
Kimiko Glenn as Helga,

13:26.000 --> 13:27.708
who's, you guessed it,
homeless.

13:27.708 --> 13:30.625
Mm, ain't nobody
got time for this.

13:30.625 --> 13:33.375
Can we get
the lobster mac and cheese,

13:33.375 --> 13:35.500
lamb face tacos,
and a bottle of Dom?

13:35.500 --> 13:36.959
Reporter:
Now, on the surface,

13:36.959 --> 13:38.750
Helga looks anything
but homeless.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.875
She's adorable
and put together,

13:40.875 --> 13:43.500
but she secretly scams
guys she meets online

13:43.500 --> 13:46.375
into buying her meals
and letting her crash.

13:46.375 --> 13:48.166
So I met this girl
on What's Up, Cupid.

13:48.166 --> 13:49.542
I think I'm falling in love.

13:49.542 --> 13:51.708
Her victims are
totally oblivious

13:51.708 --> 13:54.125
as Helga blinds them
with her adorable charm.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.208
Almost done, baby.

13:56.208 --> 13:57.542
Yay.

13:57.542 --> 14:00.417
Let's order tacos, dum-dum.
Okay. I'll pay.

14:00.417 --> 14:02.583
(gasps)
It's working out
well for her,

14:02.583 --> 14:05.125
but some people are on
to Helga and her tricks.

14:05.125 --> 14:09.000
I play Matt's weed dealer,
and he tells Matt in the pilot

14:09.000 --> 14:12.083
that Helga is actually homeless.

14:12.083 --> 14:15.500
She's called
Homeless Helga, bro.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.166
Uh-uh.
I would definitely say

14:17.166 --> 14:19.750
that Brooklyn is a character
in this show without a doubt.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.083
Matt:
You can stay
as long as you want.

14:21.083 --> 14:22.375
Helga:
Maybe I should
just move in.

14:22.375 --> 14:23.917
(Helga giggles)
Reporter:
Be sure to tune in

14:23.917 --> 14:25.750

hipster comedy.

14:25.750 --> 14:27.708
Yaaas!

14:29.125 --> 14:30.917
Reporter:
That really does
make me think twice

14:30.917 --> 14:33.125
about online dating.
What the fuck?

14:33.125 --> 14:35.083
(theme music playing)

14:45.166 --> 14:46.792
Oh, my God!

14:46.792 --> 14:49.667
Mark! I thought
that was you.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.667
Hello.
How's it going, buddy?

14:51.667 --> 14:53.125
It's been so long!

14:53.125 --> 14:55.291
I'm sorry, but do
we know each other?

14:55.291 --> 14:56.583
Uh...
Oh.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.375
Well, I'm glad you
and your Hollywood friends

14:58.375 --> 15:00.625
finally realized I was gonna
sue your fucking face off

15:00.625 --> 15:02.625
for getting rich
off of my fucking life story!

15:02.625 --> 15:06.291
Yeah, I-- I'm sorry, but I--
I don't know who you are.
Oh, okay.

15:06.291 --> 15:07.625
Listen, shithead,

15:07.625 --> 15:09.792
pretending that
I didn't endure

15:09.792 --> 15:11.708
two weeks of your stupid jokes
and your stupid fucking

15:11.708 --> 15:13.583
shitty railroad apartment
isn't gonna happen.

15:13.583 --> 15:15.667
Look, I can't say that I know
what you're talking about, Miss.

15:15.667 --> 15:17.792
You see, I recently came
into a bit of monetary success,

15:17.792 --> 15:20.041
and, well, now
all sorts of people are
crawling out of the woodwork

15:20.041 --> 15:23.333
and it kind of sounds like
you're looking for a payday too.
Does that sound right or...

15:23.333 --> 15:25.125
(screams)

15:25.125 --> 15:27.417
Are you fucking kidding me?

15:27.417 --> 15:28.917
Okay, look--
I don't need your money!

15:28.917 --> 15:30.417
But I will say that
if you and I were to spend

15:30.417 --> 15:33.041
a whole week
in my apartment together,
alone, ordering take-out

15:33.041 --> 15:35.250
and only going out at night
to drink in dark places
by ourselves,

15:35.250 --> 15:37.667
then I'm sure there'd be no one
there to back up your story.
Oh.

15:37.667 --> 15:38.667
Which never happened.

15:38.667 --> 15:41.291
Oh, well-- Oh,
you fucking idiot!

15:41.291 --> 15:43.166
Watch out! Watch out

15:43.166 --> 15:46.041
'cause my fucking lawyer's
serving your ass!

15:46.041 --> 15:50.500
Kimiko Glenn's not even Korean,
you fucking racist!

15:55.083 --> 15:58.333
Ilana: A literal monster.
Lincoln: I didn't know
you had it in there.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.667

And I'm in that mouth
on a regular basis.

16:00.667 --> 16:01.917
Well, I heard it
on a dog phone,

16:01.917 --> 16:04.041
so I don't tell
that many people,
to be honest.

16:04.041 --> 16:05.083
What's up?

16:05.083 --> 16:06.792
Heidi:
Sup? What you doing?

16:06.792 --> 16:08.000
Yeah, I'm just chilling.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.667
Rewatching some of my epic
"Broad City" performances.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.542
Oh. Interesting.

16:12.542 --> 16:14.375
Yeah, hey, quick question:

16:14.375 --> 16:18.041
do you remember that guy,
um, who used to sell us weed

16:18.041 --> 16:19.208
back when I was
living with you?

18:51.041 --> 18:53.041
I tried to get a cameo,

18:53.041 --> 18:54.542
per my Comedy Central deal,
I can only do

18:54.542 --> 18:56.667
a couple guest spots per year.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.250
Ah, well.
You remember Heidi.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.834
Yeah. Hi.
Sup?

18:59.834 --> 19:01.875
How are you doin'?
Mm, good.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.417
I'm carrying pens now.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.708
Oh, nice.
And I got some edibles

19:09.708 --> 19:12.875
and, uh, of course
I have just plain ol' flowers.

19:12.875 --> 19:15.500
Heidi: Oh, cool.
Cool case, man.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.208
Thank you.
You know, the cops,

19:17.208 --> 19:19.667
they can't ask you

Really?

19:19.667 --> 19:20.750
Really?
Yeah.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.041
Oh, that's cool.
Yeah. There you go.

Oh. Oh, my God.

19:23.375 --> 19:24.625

Beautiful.

19:24.625 --> 19:27.208
Okay, so these are sativas,
these are indicas.

These are 25, 50,
75, 15, 15.

19:31.583 --> 19:36.083
Hey, so remember that guy Mark
that you used to sell to?

19:36.083 --> 19:38.583
Um, I kind of need
you to testify

19:38.583 --> 19:40.542
that you saw us together.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.250
What?

19:43.250 --> 19:45.083
I just need you to whatever.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.625
Just say that you saw us once
in front of lawyers.

19:47.625 --> 19:50.708
You want me to testify in court
that I'm a weed dealer

19:50.708 --> 19:53.000
and that I saw you
scamming one of my clients?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.917
Not in court, no.

19:54.917 --> 19:56.458
It's a taped deposition,

19:56.458 --> 19:59.250
so you just show up
and say, "Hey."

19:59.250 --> 20:00.583
And if they ask you
about your weed,

20:00.583 --> 20:02.917
my lawyer says you just
plead the Fifth or whatever.

20:02.917 --> 20:04.792
Okay. That's-- that's--
It's just like, yeah.

20:04.792 --> 20:05.792
Cool.
Yeah.

20:05.792 --> 20:07.875
I'm not gonna do it.
(laughs)

20:07.875 --> 20:11.625
I'm calling out
the Fifth Amendment
for my rights, I guess.

20:11.625 --> 20:12.834
Yeah.
Dude!

20:12.834 --> 20:13.834
You invited me.

20:13.834 --> 20:16.333
That fucking dingle-butt

20:16.333 --> 20:17.792
stole my intellectual property

20:17.792 --> 20:19.959
and is making a shit-ton
of money off of me, okay?

20:19.959 --> 20:21.500
That's not cool.
Come on.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.000
It's like

20:23.000 --> 20:25.959
He's Mark Zuckerberg
and she's the Winklevoss twins.

20:25.959 --> 20:29.458
I think you mean
that she's Mark Zuckerberg--
She's Mark Zucker--

20:29.458 --> 20:31.125
She's the Winklevoss twins.
You're right. Yeah.

20:31.125 --> 20:33.208
She's the-- I don't know...
Okay, okay, okay, hey, hey.

20:33.208 --> 20:34.792
The Guy: I think it works.
Yeah.

20:34.792 --> 20:36.291
I am homeless.

20:37.708 --> 20:40.834
This settlement could
change my life.

20:40.834 --> 20:45.375
Yeah, but you're, like, homeless
by choice though, right?

20:45.375 --> 20:48.959
Which is your business
and, I don't know,

20:48.959 --> 20:51.000
I don't want to be
on record as a weed dealer

20:51.000 --> 20:52.458
so I can help, a...

20:52.458 --> 20:54.333
Vagabond vagina peddler?

20:54.333 --> 20:56.500
Oh, damn.
I didn't...

20:56.500 --> 20:58.625
That's not nice.
Yeah, I wasn't gonna
say that, man.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.041
Sex gypsy?

21:00.041 --> 21:02.834
Oh. Well...
Or like a...

21:02.834 --> 21:04.500
I didn't say sex gypsy.
Excuse me.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.333
I just heard
somebody else say it.
Are you finished

21:06.333 --> 21:07.750
with your slut shaming?

21:07.750 --> 21:09.375
Huh?
We're not slut shaming.

21:09.375 --> 21:10.792
I wouldn't say...
Uh, I don't know...

21:10.792 --> 21:12.792
Felt like it!
Whenever you're finished

21:12.792 --> 21:14.917
shaming me
for my sexuality...

21:14.917 --> 21:16.166
It's just sensitive times.

21:16.166 --> 21:18.166
...I have something
to show you.

21:18.166 --> 21:19.792
I play the role of Guy.

And in the pilot, he tells Matt
that Helga is homeless,

21:25.000 --> 21:27.959
and they kind of join forces
to expose her.

21:27.959 --> 21:30.125
No, what do you mean
she's homeless, dude?

21:31.291 --> 21:33.417
Sin casa,  bro.
And I love the role.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.792
He's kind of that
comic relief

21:34.792 --> 21:36.583
Oh, fuck.
and the straight man
in the show.

21:36.583 --> 21:38.208
What the fuck?
You know, he gets
to be the guy

21:38.208 --> 21:40.041
who goes (imitates fart)
but also the guy who goes,

21:40.041 --> 21:42.375
"Hey, that stinks!" You know?

21:42.375 --> 21:45.625
(man laughing)
Yeah! How about Vietnamese?

21:45.625 --> 21:48.792

21:48.792 --> 21:50.250
So happy you're amused.

21:50.250 --> 21:51.625
It's very well-written.
Thank you.

21:51.625 --> 21:54.250
Yeah, because
it's my life, actually.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.875
Listen, Ms. Park, are you able
to offer physical proof

21:56.875 --> 21:58.792
that you ever spent time
with Mr. Greene?
Yes.

21:58.792 --> 22:01.875
We have printouts of all
of our correspondences

22:01.875 --> 22:04.041
on OkCupid,
and I think you will see

22:04.041 --> 22:06.417
that Mark and I have had
several exchanges

22:06.417 --> 22:08.166
since we, uh...
before we met up.

22:08.166 --> 22:11.125
We also have a printout
of my inbox if you'd like

22:11.125 --> 22:13.542

Ms. Park?

22:13.542 --> 22:15.708
Yes?
Ms. Park, do you have proof

22:15.708 --> 22:19.458
that you actually, physically,
spent time together?

22:19.458 --> 22:21.375
My client was, well,
let's just say he was

22:21.375 --> 22:23.250
rather active
in the online dating community

22:23.250 --> 22:24.458
at the time you say
you were lovers.

22:24.458 --> 22:26.792
He was corresponding
with a number of women

22:26.792 --> 22:28.250
three years ago.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.250
Oh.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.208
You mean private stuff,
like he only has one ball?

22:32.208 --> 22:33.708

private information?

No, I don't know Heidi Park,

22:38.208 --> 22:39.792
nor am I acquainted
with her drug dealer.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.875

22:48.875 --> 22:51.375
It's been very surprising,
but I think that just, you know,

22:51.375 --> 22:53.750
speaks to the universality
of my writing.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.625
I am surprised.
