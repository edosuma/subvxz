WEBVTT

00:06.267 --> 00:09.225
As we forge our new path
together, we must remain focused

00:09.225 --> 00:11.059
on what's really important.

00:13.726 --> 00:16.726
Oh, you
got a garage inside your garage.

00:18.934 --> 00:21.851
Laurie, Ed Chen has been making
moves behind your back

00:21.851 --> 00:23.100
to try and force
you out of Raviga.

00:23.434 --> 00:26.434
I have spoken to our top LPs
to start a new firm.

00:26.434 --> 00:29.017
Would you care to jump
ship with me?

00:29.267 --> 00:31.643
You are, after all,
my best friend.

00:31.934 --> 00:32.809
What?

00:33.434 --> 00:34.392
Hello, Gavin.

00:34.392 --> 00:35.476
Richard, I'm going away.

00:36.017 --> 00:39.017
-For like, the weekend? Or--
-Good luck to you, Richard.

00:39.017 --> 00:41.184
-It's from Gavin.
-It's the patent.

00:41.184 --> 00:43.643
All right! What has two thumbs,
zero dick pics,

00:43.643 --> 00:45.309
and just quit Periscope?

00:45.768 --> 00:46.934
What the fuck is that?

00:47.184 --> 00:49.392
The biggest dick pic of all.

01:18.684 --> 01:19.851
You know what?
Should we--

01:19.851 --> 01:22.225
Fuck yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:22.225 --> 01:24.643
Uh, yeah, I guess
just put it in the garage.

01:24.643 --> 01:26.768
Oh. Uh, where I sleep?

01:26.768 --> 01:29.684
Yeah, it's just,
it's the only place
with room.

01:29.684 --> 01:32.476
Okay. Uh, well, it's good
to face your fears.

01:32.476 --> 01:35.351
I was scared of intruders
till I had one of those
in my room,

01:35.351 --> 01:38.142
and then I realized, you know,
if they're gonna kill me,
they're gonna kill me.

01:38.142 --> 01:41.142
'Cause he kept...
whispering that.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.392
All right.

01:54.975 --> 01:58.476
♪ Yeah, I alone love you ♪

02:01.559 --> 02:03.392
Hey, Russ.
"Hey, Russ"?

02:03.392 --> 02:05.893
Fuck you,
Richard Hendricks!
Fuck me regarding?

02:05.893 --> 02:09.434
It's all over the blogs.
You took our idea
to Gavin Belson?

02:09.434 --> 02:11.184
Whoa. I'm sorry.
Our idea?

02:11.184 --> 02:13.643
Yeah, the new Internet.
We came up with that together,

02:13.643 --> 02:15.726
standing outside
of my kid's school--
former school.

02:15.726 --> 02:18.392
Uh, no, um, you told me
to name an idea,

02:18.392 --> 02:21.517
and so I named one.
That was my idea,
you were just standing there.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.934
Yeah, pulling it out of you
like a newborn baby.

02:23.934 --> 02:28.893
Okay, but, well,
if a doctor pulls a baby
out of a pregnant woman,

02:28.893 --> 02:30.851
the doctor doesn't get
to then keep the baby.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.975
Okay, first of all,
my ex-wife is fucking
the doctor

02:32.975 --> 02:35.059
that delivered my son,
and they're suing
for full custody,

02:35.059 --> 02:36.851
so you're wrong.
Second of all,
this isn't a baby.

02:36.851 --> 02:38.351
Stop trying to change
the subject, Richard!

02:38.351 --> 02:40.392
Okay, well, uh,
I had to go to Gavin,

02:40.392 --> 02:42.225
because he owned the patent

02:42.225 --> 02:44.559
which, as it turns out,
he just signed over to me.

02:44.559 --> 02:46.768
So, um, it's actually good
that you're here,

02:46.768 --> 02:49.809
because... you want in
and we need funding,

02:49.809 --> 02:53.559
especially since no VC
in town will touch us,
not even Monica's new firm.

02:53.559 --> 02:56.267
So, Gavin pulls out,
and you want me to be
your sloppy seconds.

02:56.267 --> 02:58.684
It's always
about my money, isn't it?

02:58.684 --> 03:02.100
Uh, well, you are
an investor, so what else
would it be about?

03:02.100 --> 03:04.809
My idea!
It was my idea!

03:04.809 --> 03:07.643
Well, then fund it yourself.
Fuck you, Richard Hendricks.

03:07.643 --> 03:09.601
Fuck you right
in your little asshole,

03:09.601 --> 03:11.643
and not in the beautiful way,
like Grandpa and Pedro.

03:13.809 --> 03:16.434
Uh, what the hell
was that?

03:16.434 --> 03:21.559
That was the last wealthy guy
in Silicon Valley that would
even fucking talk to us.

03:21.559 --> 03:24.851
Maybe I'll give him
a day to cool off, try him
again tomorrow or something.

03:24.851 --> 03:26.267
Not so sure about that.

03:30.184 --> 03:32.267
- Oh, come on.
- Payback's a bitch,

03:32.267 --> 03:33.975
isn't it, Richard? Woo-hoo!

03:33.975 --> 03:36.476
I don't think he knows
that's not your car.

03:47.809 --> 03:50.351
Real estate listings?
What, are you looking
to move out?

03:50.351 --> 03:53.184
No, I'm just taking
a little Redfin holiday.

03:53.184 --> 03:57.059
I find there's
a certain escapist allure
to real estate listings.

03:57.059 --> 03:58.975
I like that one.

03:58.975 --> 04:00.893
Too bad it's 10 times
what I can afford,

04:00.893 --> 04:03.100
'cause, you know,
I quit Periscope to go work

04:03.100 --> 04:06.142
for a company
with zero prospects,
'cause fuck me.

04:06.142 --> 04:09.017
Well, with preconstruction
pricing, this one's

04:09.017 --> 04:11.809
actually only six times
more than you could afford.

04:11.809 --> 04:14.142
So now, let's go into Amazon

04:14.142 --> 04:15.975
and see what we could buy...

04:15.975 --> 04:18.184
...with all those
imaginary savings.

04:18.184 --> 04:19.809
Wait a minute.

04:22.434 --> 04:24.768
What if we don't need
an investor at all?

04:24.768 --> 04:26.309
Fuck all these VCs.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.851
What if all we need
is a customer?

04:28.851 --> 04:31.392
Customer for what?
We haven't built
the product yet.

04:31.392 --> 04:35.142
Well, uh, neither have
all those condo builders, right?

04:35.142 --> 04:39.517
I mean, they are offering
a discount to people who buy
before they build.

04:39.517 --> 04:42.225
We can do the same thing,
but with data storage.

04:42.225 --> 04:46.142
That sounds like a scam.
Well, no, it's actually
common practice.

04:46.142 --> 04:48.559
It's how I bought my condo.
The scam came after

04:48.559 --> 04:50.351
when I rented to a squatter
who wouldn't leave.

04:50.351 --> 04:53.684
Granted, there's no shortage
of huge corporations

04:53.684 --> 04:56.434
with vast amounts of data,
but it's highly risky.

04:56.434 --> 04:58.601
I mean, Richard,
we'd be offering
to store data

04:58.601 --> 05:01.809
on a network of cellphones
before we built the app
or the network.

05:01.809 --> 05:03.851
Yeah, but look, look,
it's no more risky

05:03.851 --> 05:06.517
than working
with all these
crazy billionaires.

05:06.517 --> 05:08.184
I mean, Jack and his boxes.

05:08.184 --> 05:11.768
Gavin just fucked off
to go find himself
who knows where.

05:11.768 --> 05:12.851
Peter died.

05:12.851 --> 05:14.726
Yeah, I guess
that makes him crazy.

05:14.726 --> 05:17.517
The point is,
if you don't draw
the line in the sand

05:17.517 --> 05:20.309
when some guy
pisses in your car,
where do you, you know?

05:20.309 --> 05:22.225
Did someone piss
in someone's car?

05:24.100 --> 05:26.351
Not literally, no. It's a, uh,

05:26.351 --> 05:29.142
It's a figure of speech,
an old one.

05:29.142 --> 05:30.517
Ah, an adage.

05:30.517 --> 05:33.392
Anyway, uh, Jared, let's get
a deck together on this.

05:33.392 --> 05:35.975
Aye, aye, Captain.
And, uh, just word to the wise,

05:35.975 --> 05:38.975
often the first customer
is the hardest one to land.

05:38.975 --> 05:41.726
Wait. Customer?
Are we pitching?

05:41.726 --> 05:43.726
Yeah, looks like it.
Hot damn, Richie!

05:43.726 --> 05:46.643
Let's hit the road.
We're gonna piss
in everyone's car.

05:46.643 --> 05:49.017
Am I using that right?

05:49.017 --> 05:52.267
Medical groups, sales groups,
insurance companies,

05:52.267 --> 05:54.517
Jared, yeah,
good work here, really.

05:54.517 --> 05:59.100
Well, Gavin was right.
His name certainly opened
a lot of doors.

05:59.100 --> 06:01.601
Ever since your announcement,
everyone has heard of us.

06:01.601 --> 06:03.100
Jared, you didn't tell
all these people

06:03.100 --> 06:05.559
that Gavin was still working
with the company, did you?

06:05.559 --> 06:09.351
Well, no, but I--
I never explicitly said
that he wasn't.

06:09.351 --> 06:11.643
- Was that wrong?
- No, Jared, that's fine.

06:11.643 --> 06:13.267
The tech will speak
for itself.

06:13.267 --> 06:14.559
It certainly will.

06:14.559 --> 06:16.559
Now, Richard,
when we get into that room,

06:16.559 --> 06:18.643
let me do
all the talking.

06:18.643 --> 06:20.559
And also the tech will talk.

06:22.267 --> 06:25.559
Wait. So Gavin's not coming?

06:25.559 --> 06:28.184
No, but we are.

06:28.184 --> 06:30.476
We've already come.

06:30.476 --> 06:31.601
Huh.

06:33.975 --> 06:35.392
Gavin left
the company?

06:35.392 --> 06:39.684
Yes, um,
but what's important--
at least we think--

06:39.684 --> 06:41.934
is not whether
Gavin is gone,

06:41.934 --> 06:45.351
but what brought him
to us in the first place,

06:45.351 --> 06:47.476
and that's the tech.

06:47.476 --> 06:48.809
Uh-huh.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.434
Gentlemen,
sorry to keep you waiting.

06:51.434 --> 06:53.434
I'm George Mandechian, CEO.

06:53.434 --> 06:56.392
I'm very excited to...

06:56.392 --> 06:58.184
He did? When?

06:59.476 --> 07:00.643
Okay.

07:05.142 --> 07:07.351
God damn it.

07:07.351 --> 07:10.643
I mean, if people
would just look
at what we're offering,

07:10.643 --> 07:11.684
I think
they'd be blown away.

07:11.684 --> 07:14.643
Perhaps we need
a new angle.

07:16.434 --> 07:18.809
I'll fake a seizure.
What?

07:18.809 --> 07:22.267
Pied Piper? Hi.
I'm Liz Tinsdale,

07:22.267 --> 07:24.351
head of compliance here
at Fiduciated General.

07:24.351 --> 07:27.100
Erlich Bachman.
And I'm, uh,
Richard Hendricks.

07:27.100 --> 07:29.267
Are we all here?
Yes, yeah, we are.

07:29.267 --> 07:31.100
Uh, sorry,
full disclosure:

07:31.100 --> 07:33.809
uh, Gavin Belson
has left the company.

07:33.809 --> 07:36.184
Oh. Oh, I see. Well--

07:36.184 --> 07:38.267
His loss.
He won't be...

07:38.267 --> 07:42.309
sitting across from someone
as charming as yourself
this afternoon, will he?

07:43.476 --> 07:45.726
Okay. Well, I mean,
you did come all the way here,

07:45.726 --> 07:50.351
so why don't you follow me?
I'd follow you to the end
of the Earth. Shall we?

07:51.684 --> 07:53.351
What are you doing, hmm?
What?

07:53.351 --> 07:56.851
So, as you can see, your data
will be even more secure,

07:56.851 --> 07:59.517
because it will be stored
on multiple devices.

07:59.517 --> 08:01.517
And we can offer you
a very competitive rate.

08:01.517 --> 08:06.601
You can expect
to see storage savings
annually of... 25 percent.

08:06.601 --> 08:10.392
Wow. That's very impressive,
all of it,

08:10.392 --> 08:13.392
but you guys have to understand
that companies like ours

08:13.392 --> 08:15.809
are particularly risk averse.

08:15.809 --> 08:18.392
Is it a slight
Idaho accent, Liz?

08:18.392 --> 08:21.392
Oh. It's Montana, actually.

08:21.392 --> 08:23.643
Even better.
The big blue sky state.
Yeah.

08:23.643 --> 08:26.267
Well, I knew you had
to have come from above.

08:26.267 --> 08:28.225
Well, uh,
speaking of heaven,

08:28.225 --> 08:30.851
that's probably
where you'll think you are

08:30.851 --> 08:33.058
when you start saving
25 percent on your data storage.

08:33.058 --> 08:34.975
Get an upgrade
from there.

08:34.975 --> 08:37.726
Liz, you have
beautiful skin.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.100
- Um, thank-- thank you.
- You, uh-- yeah.

08:41.392 --> 08:43.225
Both of you.

08:43.225 --> 08:45.726
Listen, uh, I think
I know what he's gonna say,

08:45.726 --> 08:49.267
but let me see
if I can pull my CTO in here.

08:51.059 --> 08:53.601
Can you...
reel it in a little?

08:53.601 --> 08:55.809
We're trying
to make a business deal,
not get you laid.

08:55.809 --> 08:57.434
I'm not trying
to get laid, Richard.

08:57.434 --> 08:59.684
Clearly, she has a lot
of pent-up sexual energy,

08:59.684 --> 09:02.059
likely from working
in this worm farm,

09:02.059 --> 09:03.975
so that's the angle
I'm taking

09:03.975 --> 09:06.351
since I'm not allowed
to have a seizure.

09:06.351 --> 09:08.351
Besides, she's going
to bat for us.

09:08.351 --> 09:10.934
You should be thanking me.
The CTO is on the way in.

09:10.934 --> 09:13.184
Yes, because
of the technology

09:13.184 --> 09:15.142
and because
of our business proposal.

09:15.142 --> 09:18.059
Look, can you
just please, for once,

09:18.059 --> 09:19.768
keep your dick
out of the equation?

09:19.768 --> 09:23.809
I really wish I could,
but my dick is the abacus

09:23.809 --> 09:26.142
upon which
this equation will be--
Guys.

09:26.142 --> 09:27.684
This is our CTO.

09:27.684 --> 09:28.809
Oh great.

09:29.851 --> 09:31.851
Oh, oh.

09:31.851 --> 09:32.975
Hello.

09:34.434 --> 09:37.517
I'm Dan Melcher.
Nice to meet you.

09:37.517 --> 09:38.975
Yeah. Hello.

09:39.975 --> 09:40.975
Hi, Dan.

09:42.309 --> 09:45.351
Do-- Do you guys
know each other?
No.

09:45.351 --> 09:48.267
I just said
my name was Dan,
that's how he knows.

09:48.267 --> 09:51.100
I don't need
to waste any more
of your time with this.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.351
Why don't I-I--
I'll take this one
from here.

09:53.351 --> 09:54.809
Okay?
Oh. Yeah.

10:03.851 --> 10:06.434
What the fuck
are you doing here?

10:06.434 --> 10:08.351
Very rude, Daniel.

10:08.351 --> 10:12.225
Although, what can we expect
after TechCrunch Disrupt

10:12.225 --> 10:15.351
when you sucker punched me
in the God damn face?

10:15.351 --> 10:16.684
You fucked my wife.

10:16.684 --> 10:19.851
I fucked
your wives. Plural.

10:19.851 --> 10:21.975
Both of them.
Erlich, the customer
is always right,

10:21.975 --> 10:25.517
so let's just
leave it at "wife," singular,
and be done with it.

10:25.517 --> 10:26.517
Okay.

10:28.851 --> 10:30.851
I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

10:32.851 --> 10:35.768
It took me
a very long, long time

10:35.768 --> 10:38.351
to get back on my feet
after I got fired from Oracle,

10:38.351 --> 10:40.851
and... tech firms
wouldn't touch me,

10:40.851 --> 10:45.434
but I've managed to find
a home here, a life.

10:45.434 --> 10:49.059
Okay, it's insurance.
It's not ideal,

10:49.059 --> 10:50.643
but, you know, it--
it's something.

10:50.643 --> 10:55.184
And I don't care
whatever it is that
you're selling here.

10:55.184 --> 10:56.768
I'm not buying it.

10:56.768 --> 10:58.559
Well, it's a pretty
groundbreaking technology.

10:58.559 --> 10:59.684
Oh, shut the fuck up.

10:59.684 --> 11:01.684
Okay, yeah, d-- uh--
Look at me.

11:01.684 --> 11:04.434
Never gonna happen. Okay?

11:04.434 --> 11:07.768
Never going to--
Dan?

11:07.768 --> 11:10.059
Did you give the dogs
their medicine this morning?

11:10.059 --> 11:12.601
Uh, no,
was I supposed to?

11:12.601 --> 11:14.184
Yeah, because,
remember, I had to go back

11:14.184 --> 11:16.392
to the restaurant
to get your card
that you forgot.

11:16.392 --> 11:18.809
Uh, yep. Sorry.

11:18.809 --> 11:21.059
Um, I s-- I mean,
I guess I could run home.

11:21.059 --> 11:23.726
You two married?
Oh, not yet.
We're engaged.

11:23.726 --> 11:26.476
Well, it was nice
to meet you both.
Bye now, Liz.

11:26.476 --> 11:28.392
All right, bye, honey.
Bye.

11:29.934 --> 11:31.601
Oh, Dan.

11:32.934 --> 11:36.476
Dan, Dan, Dan.

11:36.476 --> 11:39.309
Dan Melcher?
The guy who beat
the piss out of you?

11:39.309 --> 11:40.601
The very same.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.851
I looked him dead
in the eyes, and I said,

11:43.851 --> 11:46.434
"Daniel, I've fucked
every wife you've ever had.

11:46.434 --> 11:47.851
Care to go
three for three?"

11:47.851 --> 11:51.100
Needless to say,
he did not.

11:51.100 --> 11:54.434
You don't come off
in that story as well
as you think you do.

11:54.434 --> 11:58.142
So, to avoid being
thrice made a cuckold,

11:58.142 --> 11:59.601
he agreed to a deal?

11:59.601 --> 12:02.768
Well, uh, not yet.
Melcher actually
signed off on it,

12:02.768 --> 12:05.559
but his fiancée
wanted to certify

12:05.559 --> 12:07.100
that what we're trying
to build complies

12:07.100 --> 12:08.893
with their data-handling
and security protocols.

12:08.893 --> 12:10.643
We're reviewing
it all tomorrow, actually.

12:10.643 --> 12:12.142
Ah, I can't wait.

12:12.142 --> 12:14.267
Tomorrow
the real fun begins.

12:14.267 --> 12:18.768
Uh, no. No.
You're not coming.
Why not?

12:18.768 --> 12:20.934
Why not? Uh... jeez.

12:20.934 --> 12:23.309
Well, you fucked
Dan's last wife

12:23.309 --> 12:26.225
the night before
he was our judge
on the TechCrunch panel,

12:26.225 --> 12:28.851
with absolutely
no regard for what
that meant to the company.

12:28.851 --> 12:32.100
What it meant to the company
was that we went to the finals,
and we won.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.517
Because of the tech.

12:33.517 --> 12:36.100
We won because
of the tech, remember?

12:36.100 --> 12:38.267
We're getting this deal
because of the tech.

12:38.267 --> 12:39.726
I'm not letting you
fuck this up, okay?

12:39.726 --> 12:41.768
I know you're looking
for something to do,

12:41.768 --> 12:43.309
but this is not it.

12:43.309 --> 12:44.975
What do you mean,
I'm looking for something to do?

12:44.975 --> 12:47.351
You're lucky
that you've garnished
this much of my time.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.684
I have plenty to do!
Tons of lots of things!

12:49.684 --> 12:51.351
I have a thriving incubator.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.225
It is thriving.

12:59.893 --> 13:00.893
Isn't it?

13:04.851 --> 13:06.142
Fuck you, guys.

13:08.351 --> 13:12.684
Okay, so, how soon can we test
our app on a phone?

13:14.476 --> 13:17.975
Look, uh,
about all this Erlich stuff--

13:17.975 --> 13:20.851
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I-I-- I don't wanna talk
about him...

13:20.851 --> 13:23.517
or think about him...
ever again.

13:23.517 --> 13:26.309
Okay, look, I've--
I've signed off.

13:26.309 --> 13:28.684
But, Richard,
I need you

13:28.684 --> 13:31.476
to look me in the eye
and tell me that this
is gonna work,

13:31.476 --> 13:34.225
'cause if it doesn't,
I'm completely fucked.

13:34.225 --> 13:36.559
It's-- It's gonna work.
I promise.

13:38.225 --> 13:40.768
All right, well, look,
I'm gonna step out.
Okay.

13:40.768 --> 13:43.559
You're in good hands.
Okay. Okay.

13:43.559 --> 13:46.225
Should we start
with adjuster records?
Sure.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.351
You guys said
you were proficient
in video files, right?

13:48.351 --> 13:50.351
We were a--
a video chat company
for a while.

13:50.351 --> 13:53.351
Oh, that's exciting.
Uh, yeah, I guess.

13:53.351 --> 13:55.184
It-- It wasn't really for me.

13:55.184 --> 13:58.559
Um, in fact, actually,
just as we were taking off,
I walked away.

13:58.559 --> 14:01.643
Commitment issues?
Uh, I don't know.

14:01.643 --> 14:03.726
It's just I...
I never really...

14:03.726 --> 14:06.809
thought that video chat
was the best use
of our compression.

14:06.809 --> 14:09.392
Kind of felt like
I was settling, you know?

14:09.392 --> 14:12.100
Ooh!
Settling.

14:12.100 --> 14:14.768
Yeah, our company
can grow in ways...
Oh, fuck.

14:14.768 --> 14:16.351
...that we haven't
even thought of yet.

14:16.351 --> 14:18.100
I mean,
I was going to spend
the rest of my life

14:18.100 --> 14:20.893
just wondering if there
was something better.

14:20.893 --> 14:22.768
That's not really
a way to live.

14:22.768 --> 14:25.184
And, what, I'm gonna say
to all my friends, like,

14:25.184 --> 14:27.267
"Oh, this is how
I'm spending my time,"
you know?

14:27.267 --> 14:30.100
Every morning I-- I get up,
and it's vidchat.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.392
Then I go to bed,
and it's vidchat.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.267
Then I get up again,
it's vidchat.

14:33.267 --> 14:34.434
I wanna kill myself,
you know?

14:34.434 --> 14:36.684
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I think I know
what you mean.

14:36.684 --> 14:37.726
Yeah.

14:37.726 --> 14:39.809
So, what do
you think, Erlich?

14:39.809 --> 14:41.517
You're the first person
to see the place.

14:41.517 --> 14:44.434
I love the smell
of fresh spackle and hope.

14:44.434 --> 14:47.100
Yep. Two more weeks
and Bream-Hall's in business.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.601
Even better that donkey
Ed Chen and Raviga
were so blindsided,

14:50.601 --> 14:52.225
they're running around
with their hair on fire.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.934
Yeah, it's
a beautiful world, Erlich.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.809
And after years
of busting my ass,
I'm finally doing it.

14:56.809 --> 15:00.726
Oh! And check it out,
we even have swag...

15:00.726 --> 15:02.142
with my name on it.

15:02.142 --> 15:04.309
Look, "Monica Hall."
Laurie!

15:04.309 --> 15:07.059
Hello. Well, good.
Now that you're both here,

15:07.059 --> 15:09.434
we can dispense
with the mindless chitchat.

15:09.434 --> 15:12.392
I'd like to be the first
to offer you, both,

15:12.392 --> 15:16.184
the opportunity
to take me off the market.

15:18.684 --> 15:19.851
I don't understand.

15:19.851 --> 15:21.476
I'm saying
that I very much respect

15:21.476 --> 15:23.601
what you're doing here,
almost revere it,

15:23.601 --> 15:27.309
and I wanted
to offer my services
as an associate.

15:27.309 --> 15:28.726
And I will not phone it in.

15:28.726 --> 15:31.184
I'll be the first one here
at 10:30 a.m.

15:31.184 --> 15:33.559
and the last one to leave
a smidge after 4:00.

15:33.559 --> 15:35.267
I'll, of course,
need an office,

15:35.267 --> 15:37.017
an attractive
personal assistant,

15:37.017 --> 15:39.142
paternity leave,
if that goes well,

15:39.142 --> 15:42.809
and an umbrella
insurance policy
if that does not go well.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.184
What do you say?

15:47.059 --> 15:48.809
I'd like a job, dears.

15:48.809 --> 15:51.309
The singular function
of this firm

15:51.309 --> 15:54.517
is to insure
that our investors' money
is in wise hands.

15:54.517 --> 15:56.975
If... you are known
for anything,

15:56.975 --> 15:58.768
it is quite the opposite.

15:58.768 --> 16:00.059
Therefore, no.

16:03.142 --> 16:04.768
I'm sorry, Erlich.

16:04.768 --> 16:07.351
Look, I--
I know you're looking
for something to do, but--

16:07.351 --> 16:09.351
Who-- Who is pushing
this false narrative

16:09.351 --> 16:11.934
that I am looking
for something to do?

16:11.934 --> 16:15.434
"But"... what?
But Laurie is my partner,

16:15.434 --> 16:18.017
and if she doesn't think
you add any real value,

16:18.017 --> 16:20.017
then there's no future
for you here.

16:20.017 --> 16:21.975
I gave you weed,
a lot of it.

16:21.975 --> 16:24.809
You want a fleece?

16:24.809 --> 16:27.059
God, there's
something beautiful

16:27.059 --> 16:28.768
about testing
your first alpha.

16:28.768 --> 16:32.059
It's like watching
a child take its first steps.

16:32.059 --> 16:37.100
Well, let's see
if our space-saver app
actually saves us any space.

16:37.100 --> 16:39.267
All right. Done.

16:39.267 --> 16:41.225
Yeah?

16:41.225 --> 16:44.017
Can I mark
this deliverable
as complete?

16:44.017 --> 16:46.559
Is our child a dancer?

16:48.059 --> 16:53.059
Wait. I was
only using 32.2 gigs
of data before the test,

16:53.059 --> 16:55.893
and now it says
I'm using 47.8.

16:55.893 --> 16:58.517
Fuck. Mine expanded also.
What the fuck?

16:58.517 --> 17:03.100
Why do I have a photo folder
entitled "Cool Hairstyles"?

17:03.100 --> 17:07.099
Why do I have an e-mail
for the "Anton LaVey Fun Run"?

17:10.059 --> 17:11.643
Fuck. We had a merge error.

17:11.643 --> 17:13.643
All of our information
is on both phones.

17:13.643 --> 17:15.601
I wonder what kind
of weird shit you get into.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.224
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

17:17.224 --> 17:20.142
I'm just looking
at your very embarrassing
personal information.

17:20.142 --> 17:22.893
Fuck you.
If you look at my shit,
I'm gonna look at your shit.

17:22.893 --> 17:24.142
All right,
whoa, whoa.
Easy now.

17:24.142 --> 17:26.142
I'll go balls deep
on your inbox.

17:26.142 --> 17:29.684
If you've taken
one fucking selfie,
I will find it.

17:29.684 --> 17:31.768
Okay, guys,
we've got to calm down.

17:31.768 --> 17:34.601
Okay? Look at this.
This is not where
we wanna be.

17:34.601 --> 17:36.059
Let's-- Let's take
a deep breath,

17:36.059 --> 17:39.434
and let's just be cool
and put our phones down.

17:40.434 --> 17:41.809
Go ahead.

17:41.809 --> 17:43.975
I'll put it down
once he stops touching it.

17:43.975 --> 17:45.851
Okay. Great.

17:45.851 --> 17:48.768
Good. That wasn't
so hard, was it?

17:50.643 --> 17:53.100
If he can do it--
No. No, no,
no, no, no.

17:53.100 --> 17:54.809
It's okay.
Gotcha.

17:54.809 --> 17:57.851
No, you didn't.
Fuck you.

18:01.351 --> 18:04.476
Are those
almond poppy seed muffins
or lemon poppy seed muffins?

18:04.476 --> 18:08.768
No matter, I'll take both,
and the, uh, whole first floor.

18:08.768 --> 18:09.809
It's been a...

18:10.809 --> 18:11.809
pretty bad...

18:13.100 --> 18:14.684
Uh, you know what?

18:16.351 --> 18:17.975
Do you have
any day-olds?

18:25.726 --> 18:27.059
Hey, are you
sitting here?

18:27.059 --> 18:28.559
What the fuck
does it look like?

18:28.559 --> 18:31.392
Sorry. He didn't tell us
who he was inviting
to the meeting.

18:31.392 --> 18:33.975
He just said it was
a bunch of us.
How many are we?

18:33.975 --> 18:35.392
I think
a few other firms
are coming.

18:35.392 --> 18:37.975
Sequoia and Greylock,
maybe a few more
for this round.

18:37.975 --> 18:39.476
Jeff from Index Ventures.

18:40.517 --> 18:42.476
You brought swag
to a pitch meeting?

18:42.476 --> 18:44.142
Yikes, that's
so three years ago.

18:44.142 --> 18:45.184
Have you seen
Keenan yet?

18:46.392 --> 18:50.184
I don't know who that is.

18:50.184 --> 18:53.184
Seriously, though,
I don't know who
you're talking about.

18:53.184 --> 18:55.351
Bream-Hall?

18:56.684 --> 18:58.768
Hey, man.
I don't know who
you think you are,

18:58.768 --> 19:00.476
but you're not supposed
to be at this table.

19:00.476 --> 19:02.059
I don't know
who you think you are,

19:02.059 --> 19:03.768
but men aren't supposed
to grow tits,

19:03.768 --> 19:06.893
and yet there they are,
atop your little paunch.

19:10.726 --> 19:12.017
Who the fuck are you?

19:12.017 --> 19:13.975
I'm fucking
Erlich Bachman.

19:13.975 --> 19:15.392
Who the fuck are you?

19:15.392 --> 19:17.059
I'm Keenan Feldspar.

19:19.267 --> 19:21.517
And I like the balls on you.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.768
Get outta there!
I wanna sit next
to this guy!

19:26.225 --> 19:27.934
Yeah.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.851
Oh, man!
Nice swag!

19:30.934 --> 19:33.225
I tell you, it is, um,
it is warm in here.

19:33.225 --> 19:37.392
Oh. Yeah, they, um,
shut the AC off
after midnight.

19:37.392 --> 19:40.559
Oh.
The things this company goes
through to save a dime.

19:40.559 --> 19:43.601
Well, classic Melcher.

19:43.601 --> 19:47.934
Okay, should we cover
this section on intrusion
detection and prevention?

19:51.059 --> 19:52.059
Liz?
Huh?

19:52.059 --> 19:53.726
Okay, I don't want to pry,

19:53.726 --> 19:55.267
but did I do
something wrong?

19:55.267 --> 19:58.726
It's just
for the past few hours,
you've been a little, um...

19:58.726 --> 20:01.934
checked out.
Uh, I'm just...

20:01.934 --> 20:04.434
thinking.
So, you're getting
cold feet?

20:04.434 --> 20:07.267
What?
It's okay. I know what
you're dealing with.

20:07.267 --> 20:10.267
I don't think you do.
I do. Trust me, I do.

20:10.267 --> 20:13.100
Okay, I bet someone
in your position

20:13.100 --> 20:17.059
has been told many times
to look before you leap.

20:17.059 --> 20:19.059
But, Liz...

20:19.059 --> 20:23.559
what about right now you just...
leap before you look?

20:23.559 --> 20:28.809
Oh.
And, look, I'm gonna
go out on a limb here,

20:28.809 --> 20:30.809
but I'm gonna
go ahead and say

20:30.809 --> 20:34.267
that I'll bet there's a piece
of you deep down inside

20:34.267 --> 20:37.809
that... knows
this is a good idea.

20:37.809 --> 20:39.809
It's new, it's exciting.

20:39.809 --> 20:43.476
I mean, by God, Liz,
this is the most durable,

20:43.476 --> 20:46.768
sophisticated decentralized
storage infrastructure

20:46.768 --> 20:47.851
the world has-- Mm!

20:53.934 --> 20:55.100
Whoa.
Uh...

21:04.893 --> 21:07.684
And then it just happened.

21:07.684 --> 21:10.684
On the floor?
We were like
two wild animals.

21:10.684 --> 21:12.768
I'm sure it was magnificent.

21:12.768 --> 21:15.184
I get pissed at Erlich
for not keeping it
in his pants,

21:15.184 --> 21:16.517
and then I go ahead
and do this?

21:16.517 --> 21:19.017
Shit. I mean,
Dan's gonna find out.

21:19.017 --> 21:21.726
I mean, he punched Erlich
in the face for when
he did it to him,

21:21.726 --> 21:23.517
and now what do you think
he's gonna do to me, huh?

21:23.517 --> 21:26.267
He's gonna fucking kill me,
then the deal's gonna
fall through.

21:26.267 --> 21:30.059
I can't believe I jeopardized
the entire company with my dick.

21:30.059 --> 21:32.434
Hey, hey.
We can get through this.

21:32.434 --> 21:34.351
Yeah.
All right. First,
I need some details.

21:35.809 --> 21:38.351
Are you in love?
What?

21:38.351 --> 21:40.142
No, no,
I barely know her.

21:40.142 --> 21:41.601
Okay. Okay, that's good.

21:41.601 --> 21:45.184
Then, we just need
to extricate you
from this situation.

21:45.184 --> 21:46.851
Okay.
Now, it's not
gonna be easy,

21:46.851 --> 21:49.059
because she's very probably
in love with you.

21:49.059 --> 21:50.975
Jared, I--
I don't think
that that's--

21:50.975 --> 21:53.225
Richard, this is no time
for false humility.

21:53.225 --> 21:55.059
You're a catch.
Just deal with it.

21:55.059 --> 21:58.934
Now, you need
to break this thing off
clean and clear,

21:58.934 --> 22:00.893
so you just walk
into that office

22:00.893 --> 22:03.726
and-- and you look her
in the eyes, and you say...
Mm-hmm?

22:03.726 --> 22:05.768
"Listen, baby...

22:05.768 --> 22:08.309
"you're getting hitched,
and-- and I...

22:08.309 --> 22:09.684
was born to roam."

22:10.559 --> 22:11.684
"Born to roam"?

22:11.684 --> 22:13.934
Hey, Jared,
did I miss any calls?

22:13.934 --> 22:15.351
Not a good time,
my man.

22:15.351 --> 22:16.893
Jared.

22:16.893 --> 22:18.559
Uh... sorry.

22:20.351 --> 22:21.893
Nope. No calls.

22:21.893 --> 22:23.225
What a shocker.

22:24.225 --> 22:25.267
I need to call Tara.

22:25.267 --> 22:26.517
Okay, but I--

22:26.517 --> 22:28.225
I need to hold
your phone.

22:28.225 --> 22:29.726
It might be sexual
in nature.

22:29.726 --> 22:32.601
Well, I think
I can handle that.

22:33.768 --> 22:34.768
All right.

22:34.768 --> 22:37.809
No, um, something else
in here, please?

22:37.809 --> 22:39.893
Monica, this salient--
Mmm?

22:42.434 --> 22:43.601
Ladies.

22:43.601 --> 22:44.934
What are
you doing here?

22:44.934 --> 22:48.975
I believe the answer
to that question...

22:48.975 --> 22:53.768
is currently sitting
in your unfinished
waiting area.

22:56.267 --> 22:59.309
Holy shit. Is that...
Keenan Feldspar? Yes.

23:00.351 --> 23:01.434
Why? Have you heard of him?

23:01.434 --> 23:04.934
Of course.
Every competent VC has.

23:04.934 --> 23:08.100
His VR headset is reputed
to be the new standard.

23:08.100 --> 23:12.267
Oh, it is. I tested
the prototype last night
at his house.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.726
We got quite drunk.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.809
What exactly is he doing
in our waiting area?

23:16.809 --> 23:18.975
Well, Laurie,
he's waiting...

23:18.975 --> 23:20.476
upon my instruction.

23:25.643 --> 23:27.559
Imagine...

23:27.559 --> 23:30.684
landing the biggest whale
in the Valley...

23:30.684 --> 23:32.476
two weeks

23:32.476 --> 23:35.184
before you launch
your firm.

23:35.184 --> 23:39.975
Or should I say
before we launch your firm?

23:42.559 --> 23:45.476
All right.
The new build is done.

23:45.476 --> 23:47.517
Oh, I am so glad
this is over.

23:47.517 --> 23:50.684
I felt like Gibraltar
in World War II,

23:50.684 --> 23:54.934
where it was
both crucial
and inert.

23:54.934 --> 23:58.017
All right.
One press of the button,
and we are back to normal.

24:01.517 --> 24:02.934
What's the problem?

24:02.934 --> 24:04.184
I don't know.

24:05.100 --> 24:07.059
What don't you know?

24:07.059 --> 24:10.768
Well, you seem a bit eager
to resolve the situation.

24:10.768 --> 24:13.517
You're almost anxious.

24:13.517 --> 24:15.934
It's a new color on you.
A new color
on you would be--

24:15.934 --> 24:19.392
Bah, bah, bah.
Even as you try and make
a boring, racist comment,

24:19.392 --> 24:21.309
you can't keep
your eyes off my phone.

24:22.517 --> 24:25.726
See? Now, I know
all my embarrassing shit
is on your phone

24:25.726 --> 24:28.517
and if you look at it,
you will mock me endlessly
and without mercy.

24:28.517 --> 24:32.476
But what's also true
is that you already mock me
endlessly and without mercy,

24:32.476 --> 24:35.351
so I have
nothing to lose

24:35.351 --> 24:38.392
and, potentially,
a huge amount to gain.

24:38.392 --> 24:40.225
Guys, this is madness.

24:40.225 --> 24:41.517
I have nothing to hide.

24:41.517 --> 24:43.726
I hear you,
and yet...

24:46.225 --> 24:47.851
I'd like to look
at my phone.

24:47.851 --> 24:49.100
Sure.

24:50.059 --> 24:51.726
Suit yourself.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.601
Swipe.
Mm-hmm.

24:54.601 --> 24:57.351
Unlock.
Mmm.

24:57.351 --> 24:58.851
You sure
you don't care?

24:58.851 --> 25:01.184
Does it look like I care?

25:01.184 --> 25:03.726
Okay.

25:10.184 --> 25:12.684
Ah! Ugh. Fuck!

25:14.142 --> 25:15.267
What the fuck?

25:19.100 --> 25:20.726
You dick!

25:22.476 --> 25:23.851
Give me the phone.
Dinesh.

25:23.851 --> 25:25.809
Give it to me.
You are not
thinking clearly.

25:25.809 --> 25:27.267
Ow!

25:27.267 --> 25:28.726
Sorry.

25:42.100 --> 25:43.643
Looks like
we both lose.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.851
I don't think so.
How do you figure?

25:45.851 --> 25:48.351
'Cause now I know you had
some embarrassing shit to hide.

25:48.351 --> 25:50.142
I don't even need
to know what it is.

25:50.142 --> 25:52.267
My phone may be
in the toilet, but...

25:53.768 --> 25:56.100
but I win.
No, you don't.

25:56.100 --> 25:58.975
Because you'll never know
what was on there...

25:58.975 --> 26:01.893
and that will slowly
drive you down a dark path

26:01.893 --> 26:03.975
and torment you,
so that every fiber--

26:03.975 --> 26:06.142
Nuh-uh!
I win! I win!

26:06.142 --> 26:08.975
I win. I win. I win!

26:08.975 --> 26:10.934
I win!

26:13.351 --> 26:14.643
Shut up, Jared.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.975
Last night...

26:25.975 --> 26:28.559
Yeah.
Last night was...

26:28.559 --> 26:30.934
Bad.
...bad. Bad.

26:30.934 --> 26:33.100
Yeah, oh my God. Yeah.
It was bad, right?

26:33.100 --> 26:35.351
It was such
a bad thing
to have done.

26:35.351 --> 26:37.809
The worst sex
I think I've ever had...

26:37.809 --> 26:38.934
by far.

26:40.934 --> 26:44.309
Oh, s-- it--
so it was bad
for you... too.

26:44.309 --> 26:47.684
Yeah, I mean,
it was just all elbows.

26:47.684 --> 26:49.851
I mean, how many times
did our teeth clink?

26:49.851 --> 26:52.809
Uh, too many.
Mm-mm. Too many.
You know?

26:52.809 --> 26:54.851
Too many.
And you move
your head a lot.

26:55.726 --> 26:57.809
Well... passion--
None.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.142
Right? I know.
Definitely.

27:00.142 --> 27:01.559
Like right out of the gate.

27:01.559 --> 27:02.975
When I took my top off,

27:02.975 --> 27:05.434
and you actually said
the word "gulp"?

27:05.434 --> 27:06.601
I said it?
Yes. Yeah.

27:06.601 --> 27:07.851
Out loud? Okay.
Mm-hmm.

27:07.851 --> 27:09.184
Well, mistake on my part.

27:09.184 --> 27:11.351
As bad as it was, you know,

27:11.351 --> 27:13.893
and it was bad, um...
Okay.

27:13.893 --> 27:17.267
...like... really... awful.

27:17.267 --> 27:18.476
I get it.
I just...

27:19.476 --> 27:22.225
If there's an upside
to any of this,

27:22.225 --> 27:25.309
it would be
that I realize now

27:25.309 --> 27:26.559
what I have in Dan.

27:26.559 --> 27:29.225
Silver lining,
so that's nice.
Listen,

27:29.225 --> 27:31.100
I can't do this...
anymore.

27:31.100 --> 27:32.601
This-- What we--
Yeah.

27:32.601 --> 27:35.225
So, I just wanna--
If we could just
close the deal,

27:35.225 --> 27:37.225
be done with it.

27:37.225 --> 27:40.309
And if it's okay with Dan,
it's fine with me.

27:40.309 --> 27:41.851
So...
Good.

27:42.851 --> 27:44.059
Okay.
Okay.

27:44.059 --> 27:47.267
So, I will come back and get
my stuff when you're gone.

27:48.893 --> 27:51.559
No, I'm just
gonna... the door.
To...

27:51.559 --> 27:53.392
I was born to roam,
anyways.

28:01.559 --> 28:02.934
Richard.

28:11.184 --> 28:12.434
Liz just told me.

28:14.559 --> 28:16.267
She did?
Yup.

28:18.768 --> 28:22.476
And... if it's fine with her,
then I guess the deal
is fine with me,

28:22.476 --> 28:24.434
so... it's approved.

28:25.684 --> 28:27.100
Good.
I'll ride down
with you.

28:27.100 --> 28:29.517
Oh, you don't have to. Okay.

28:37.392 --> 28:38.392
Listen.

28:39.392 --> 28:42.184
It goes
without saying, but...

28:42.184 --> 28:47.267
Liz can never find out
about that whole thing
between us.

I would like a--

30:05.059 --> 30:07.184
What, did you graze your penis
against a toilet seat?

30:07.184 --> 30:09.975
No. I-- I had sex.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.184
-Sex with what?
-A female.

30:12.601 --> 30:13.768
A female what?

30:14.434 --> 30:15.726
A female human.

30:17.059 --> 30:19.684
Uh, yeah. Hello. Could I
transfer you to my supervisor?

30:19.934 --> 30:21.225
Oh. No, no, no.

30:21.225 --> 30:23.559
Just do your best Ed Chen
impression.

30:23.851 --> 30:26.309
What's up?
You got Ed Ch-- uh, Chambers.

30:26.309 --> 30:27.934
- He's amazing.
- Who?

30:27.934 --> 30:29.934
-Ed Chambers.
-Go for Chambers.

30:30.225 --> 30:33.601
Ned, I knew it was you.

30:33.809 --> 30:36.684
Hey. Did that pussy Jared
keep you on hold long?
