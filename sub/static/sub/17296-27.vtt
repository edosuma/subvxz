What's this feeling, yo?

00:28.724 --> 00:31.161
It is as though the
good times have fled,

00:31.205 --> 00:32.641
never to do the returning.

00:32.684 --> 00:36.210
Yeah, it's really
just like, whatever.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.081
Oh, no. It's happening.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.300
What's happening, bro?

00:39.343 --> 00:41.215
The Blahs! They're back!

00:42.781 --> 00:44.261
Not the Blahs!

00:46.481 --> 00:47.830
He's right. We've
got the Blahs!

00:47.873 --> 00:51.268
The Blahs.
They's inside me, mama.

00:51.312 --> 00:55.185
Trying to be upbeat,
but Blahs too strong.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.274
How can we fight back
against these Blahs?

00:57.318 --> 01:00.451
We need the fun activity,
set to the music!

01:00.495 --> 01:02.540
Like a dance party?

01:02.584 --> 01:04.194
Did someone say "dance party"?

01:05.935 --> 01:08.546
- I did.
- I know. That's why I said,

01:08.590 --> 01:10.940
"Did somebody
say 'dance party'?"

01:12.463 --> 01:14.117
It was the Beast Boy
who said it.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.554
I hear you, girl.
That's why I said,

01:16.598 --> 01:20.210
"Did somebody say 'dance party'?"

01:20.254 --> 01:21.690
They already told you
Beast Boy said it!

01:21.733 --> 01:23.431
Guys, come on.
When I was like,

01:23.474 --> 01:25.650
"Did someone say
'dance party'?"

01:25.694 --> 01:28.088
You were all supposed
to be like, "Dance party!"

01:28.131 --> 01:30.351
And then, you know,
we have a dance party.

01:30.394 --> 01:31.656
- Oh.
- I gets it.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.267
- All right, all right.
- Of course.

01:33.310 --> 01:37.140
So, did someone
say "dance party"?

01:37.184 --> 01:38.576
Dance party!

01:40.448 --> 01:41.884
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:41.927 --> 01:44.147
This is not the music
we are looking for.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.322
What are you talking about?

01:45.366 --> 01:46.758
This is some good music.

01:46.802 --> 01:49.239
Not good enough.
Play the song, bro.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.067
Of what song do you speak?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.547
Come on. You know.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.331
- Do I?
- Yes.

01:54.375 --> 01:55.593
- You know.
- Give me a hint.

01:55.637 --> 01:58.161
The greatest song ever written?

01:58.205 --> 01:59.249
Hmm.

01:59.293 --> 02:01.382
Gets you pumped up.

02:01.425 --> 02:02.339
Uh...

02:02.383 --> 02:03.775
A musical arrangement

02:03.819 --> 02:05.473
written and performed
by Carl Burnett,

02:05.516 --> 02:08.084
Franklin Enea
and William J. Regan,

02:08.128 --> 02:09.346
also known as B.E.R.,

02:09.390 --> 02:10.956
that resides magically
in your soul

02:11.000 --> 02:13.785
and can transport the listener
to an alternate dimension,

02:13.829 --> 02:16.484
inspired by the album
art of the 1980s.

02:16.527 --> 02:18.616
Maybe sing it for me.
That might help.

Why don't we look
like this all the time?

04:02.416 --> 04:05.375
Because it's too
rad, Robin. Too rad.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.029
Cyborg, I have been wondering.

04:07.072 --> 04:10.467
What exactly is this world
of the eternal shining nights?

04:10.511 --> 04:12.077
It's a mystery.
All I know is,

04:12.121 --> 04:14.602
this song is the key
to this reality.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.430
Indeed it is.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.434
Whoa.

04:20.477 --> 04:21.739
And for that reason,

04:21.783 --> 04:24.394
you will give the song to me.

04:24.438 --> 04:25.569
Who are you?

04:25.613 --> 04:27.745
And why do you desire the song?

04:27.789 --> 04:31.183
All you need to know
is the song belongs to me.

04:31.227 --> 04:33.360
Now, hand it over.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.405
- No!
- You can't owns music, yo.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.277
It belongs to everyone.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.583
I won't ask again,
little machine man.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.324
I won't give it away.

04:41.368 --> 04:42.586
It's a part of me.

04:42.630 --> 04:45.502
Then I will pull it
from your metal bones.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.112
Titans, roll out.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.958
Cyborg!

05:50.001 --> 05:51.176
Hang on, bro!

05:53.657 --> 05:56.660
No!

05:58.619 --> 06:00.708
No one can save you now.

06:00.751 --> 06:03.145
Give the song to me!

06:03.188 --> 06:04.189
No.

06:07.062 --> 06:10.718
There is no escape, metal man.

06:10.761 --> 06:14.243
Soon the night will
shine no more.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.773
- Where?
- We're back.

06:22.817 --> 06:24.253
But where's Cyborg?

06:24.296 --> 06:25.515
He must be trapped

06:25.559 --> 06:27.517
in the dimension
of the night shines.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.432
We gots to go back for him!

06:29.476 --> 06:32.348
But the only way in is
through the power of the song.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.350
Then we'll sing our way in.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.422
Probably because
you sing like garbage.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.163
The song was made for magic

07:05.207 --> 07:07.427
and the magic
is the key to that land.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.733
Without that little miracle
created by B.E.R.

07:09.777 --> 07:12.432
the dimension is
closed to us forever.

07:12.475 --> 07:13.694
Not necessarily.

07:13.737 --> 07:15.565
We might not be able
to recreate the magic,

07:15.609 --> 07:18.742
but I bet if we turn to some of the
biggest artists in music today,

07:18.786 --> 07:20.004
they could help us.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.615
Why? Why would they do that?

07:21.658 --> 07:24.095
Because there's nothing
famous musicians love more

07:24.139 --> 07:27.011
than fulfilling the weird
requests of random fans.

07:36.630 --> 07:37.935
CeeLo!

07:37.979 --> 07:39.807
CeeLo Green in the hizzouse!

07:39.850 --> 07:41.765
Goodie Mob, Dungeon Fam.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.941
What, what, what?
Up top, CeeLo.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.900
Um, who let you back here?

07:45.943 --> 07:46.814
CeeLo.

07:46.857 --> 07:49.512
Oh. May I call you the CeeHi?

07:49.556 --> 07:50.992
Or How High the C?

07:51.035 --> 07:53.298
Or the High C That You Hit

07:53.342 --> 07:54.561
Which Is Not Low At All?

07:57.912 --> 08:00.523
Look, CeeLo,
I know this sounds crazy.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.785
Get it?

08:05.702 --> 08:07.530
Who let you back here?

08:09.924 --> 08:11.795
Anyway, we need you
to perform a magical song

08:11.839 --> 08:13.231
to open a door
to an alternate dimension

08:13.275 --> 08:14.972
so we can save our
friend from a dragon.

08:15.016 --> 08:17.627
Oh. Yeah, yeah, all right.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.063
Who let you back here?

08:27.115 --> 08:29.683
All right, Fall Out Boy.
Ready when you are.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.558
Oh, yeah!

08:35.602 --> 08:36.907
I'm totes feeling that.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.431
That was so...
Fresh.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.216
Fall Out Boy's killing it!

08:41.259 --> 08:42.652
Fall Out Boy!

08:42.696 --> 08:44.436
Uh, who let you back...

08:44.480 --> 08:46.482
Before you ask who let us
back here, hear us out.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.179
My best bro is trapped
in another world

08:48.223 --> 08:50.704
by this dragon,
but there's a magic song.

08:50.747 --> 08:53.358
- A magic song?
- We realize it sounds the cray-cray.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.883
I knew it! I told you
magic songs were real.

08:55.926 --> 08:59.321
Pete's always
talking about magic songs.

08:59.364 --> 09:00.670
Don't encourage him.

09:00.714 --> 09:02.019
There is one for reals!

09:02.063 --> 09:04.021
And if you guys play
this magic song,

09:04.065 --> 09:06.720
you guys could turn into
a giant robot or something

09:06.763 --> 09:08.373
and help us save our friend.

09:08.417 --> 09:10.767
A magic song that can
turn us into a giant robot?

09:10.811 --> 09:12.334
I want to turn
into a giant robot.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.858
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He said,
"A giant robot or something."

09:14.902 --> 09:16.599
I know we're asking a lot,

09:16.643 --> 09:18.645
but the Teen Titans need you.

09:18.688 --> 09:19.733
Is Batman involved?

09:19.776 --> 09:21.343
Do you want him to be involved?

09:22.344 --> 09:23.998
- Oh, yeah.
- Well...

09:24.041 --> 09:26.130
It's... It's very likely that

09:26.174 --> 09:27.479
he will probably

09:27.523 --> 09:29.830
make an appearance. Maybe.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.701
I don't think Batman's
involved, Joe.

09:31.745 --> 09:32.702
Guys, we gotta do it.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.661
Magic song. Giant robot.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.793
This will be cool. I promise.

09:36.837 --> 09:37.968
I'm sorry, Titans.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.622
It just doesn't work like that.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.668
We can only make our own magic.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.234
The way every band does.

09:43.278 --> 09:45.497
- So, that's a no?
- Oh, definitely a no.

09:45.541 --> 09:47.108
- No way.
- Nah-uh.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.805
Come on, guys.
Let's get out of here.

09:48.849 --> 09:51.808
Why am I the only one that ever
wants to play a magic song

09:51.852 --> 09:53.375
