WEBVTT

00:05.073 --> 00:06.740
Previously on ER:

00:06.774 --> 00:09.043
You did this,
you selfish bitch,

00:09.077 --> 00:10.278
so you live
with that.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.812
And I talked to the guys
at Hopkins.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.781
We're trying to get you
into the IGF-1 trial.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.083
IGF-1, what's that?

00:15.116 --> 00:16.517
Insulin-like Growth Factor.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.286
It could slow down
the progression of the disease.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.788
I'm applying for a part-time
job, and it'd help

00:20.821 --> 00:22.290
if you could write
a letter or something.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.225
What kind of work?
An EMT.

00:24.258 --> 00:26.127
In City Fire,
you need someone
on the inside

00:26.160 --> 00:27.528
to help you move up,
you know?

00:27.561 --> 00:29.130
I'll help your brother out.
No worries.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.799
The guy's an alcoholic.
Yeah, well, so am I.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.102
Luka's father got sick.
He had to fly back to Croatia.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.469
The chemo could take,
like, six months

00:35.503 --> 00:36.537
and we have a life here.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.583 --> 00:51.385
It's crazy how much
he loves that book.

00:51.419 --> 00:54.488
Yeah, he must really miss
Dr. Kovac.

00:54.522 --> 00:57.091
Well, it won't
be too much longer.

00:57.125 --> 00:58.426
I hope not.

00:58.459 --> 01:02.463
Don't want him
to forget who
his dad is.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.565
Okay, Joe-Joe,
here we go.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.204
Try to get him
to eat some kale today.

01:10.238 --> 01:13.174
Uh-huh.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.243
Alright, I'll see
you guys at 5:00.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.145
We'll be here.
Have a good day.

01:17.178 --> 01:20.248
Bye, sweetie.
I love you.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.249
Bye.
Bye.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.454
Mrs. Fratelli,
that's really not necessary.

01:26.487 --> 01:27.555
It's the least
I can do.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.789
You people are saints.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.458
Well, I appreciate
the thought.

01:30.491 --> 01:33.327
Nurse Taggart, you know,
my little Paulie, my angel,

01:33.361 --> 01:35.196
he's my only child.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.298
So if it weren't for you
and the other doctors,

01:37.331 --> 01:40.334
I mean, you know, he wouldn't be
here right now.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.336
Look, that's very kind, but
we're just doing our jobs.

01:42.370 --> 01:45.339
No, I insist!
Come on. My salon,
it's full service.

01:45.373 --> 01:48.442
Manis, pedis, makeovers,
massages,

01:48.476 --> 01:51.445
whatever your staff wants,
on the house all day!

01:51.479 --> 01:53.214
Come on!

01:53.247 --> 01:55.349
You people spend every day
taking care of other people.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.618
Let somebody
take care of you
for once.

01:57.651 --> 02:00.421
Okay, I guess you can set up
in the break room.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.657
Great! You ever
thought about
going blond?

02:03.691 --> 02:05.293
Might look great
on you.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.294
Hey, guys.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.328
Hey.
Hey.

02:07.361 --> 02:10.231
Oh, my God, Dr. Lockhart, hi!

02:10.264 --> 02:12.200
Hi.
How are you?

02:12.233 --> 02:14.268
Good. How are you?

02:14.302 --> 02:15.436
I'm fabulous!

02:15.469 --> 02:17.205
And, and Paulie's doing great.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.206
He wanted to come,
you know,

02:18.239 --> 02:19.440
but he's got school.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.209
Guess what?
Free makeovers today.

02:21.209 --> 02:21.875
We'll start
with you first.

02:21.909 --> 02:23.677
Thanks, I'm good.

02:23.711 --> 02:27.648
No, no, no, I got
some great, wonderful,
natural treatments.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.917
Come on. I think
you would love it.
No, really, I'm fine.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.453
And I'm sorry, but
but, but who are you?

02:32.486 --> 02:35.523
Angie. I came in
with my son Paulie.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.924
Oh, look at those
brown eyes.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.427
Oh, my God.
I can make these...

02:39.460 --> 02:41.762
Sheila, did you see
her eyes?!

02:41.795 --> 02:42.830
PRATT:
Alright,
talk to me.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.365
Willy Archibald, he's 59...

02:44.398 --> 02:46.467
Ground-level fall,
complains of hip pain.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.269
Denies head trauma
or LOC.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.803
Good vitals.
No meds or allergies.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.239
How'd you fall, sir?

02:51.272 --> 02:52.640
I must have tripped
on something.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.942
Before you fell,
did you have any
chest pain,

02:54.975 --> 02:56.410
shortness of breath,
palpitations?

02:56.444 --> 02:57.811
No, nothing like that.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.380
My hip's killing me,
though.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.315
Alright, let's get him
four of morphine.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.651
Let's get a full
hip and pelvis series.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.986
So, how you doing, man?

03:06.019 --> 03:07.255
Oh, he's doing great.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.489
I love breaking in
rookies.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.691
Have we met?
Zach Flaherty.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.593
Just transferred in
from Rogers Park.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.495
Must be nice.
Wish I had a doctor

03:14.528 --> 03:16.264
for a brother when
I was coming up.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.501
Please do what you can.
He's a great kid.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.336
He really deserves this.

03:22.370 --> 03:26.340
Okay, I'll hold. Alright.

03:26.374 --> 03:29.743
Hi, Mr. Rios. Yes,
this is Dr. Tony Gates.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.712
Right, yes,
from County General.

03:31.745 --> 03:37.651
Um, yeah, unfortunately, uh...
it's true, it's terminal.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.420
Yeah, his name is Josh Lipnicki,

03:39.453 --> 03:41.455
and, um, well,
he's leaving tomorrow

03:41.489 --> 03:43.291
so I guess
it would have to be today.

03:43.291 --> 03:46.627
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I know it's short notice, but...

03:46.660 --> 03:49.297
Yeah. Oh, thank you, sir.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.299
I really appreciate you
trying to work this out.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.966
Alright, thank you, sir.
Thank you.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.670
Free makeovers, huh?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.339
Yeah. It's a
good idea, Sam.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.473
It'd be good
for morale.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.442
I can't take
the credit for it.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.444
I don't even remember
treating that lady's kid.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.545
What?

04:04.578 --> 04:06.314
What "what"?

04:06.314 --> 04:08.782
Like you remember
every patient that
comes through here.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.984
Hey, Pratt, you guys got
a hyponatremic for me?

04:11.018 --> 04:12.320
Yep.
She's altered

04:12.353 --> 04:13.387
and her electrolytes
are out of whack

04:13.421 --> 04:14.555
after gastric bypass.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.757
Curtain four.
She's almost ready.

04:16.790 --> 04:20.060
Dr. Morris, the broken leg kid
is ready to go,

04:20.093 --> 04:22.696
and the crackhead in two
won't keep his gown on.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.632
The broken leg kid
can be discharged.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.999
What about the crackhead?

04:26.033 --> 04:27.000
I don't know.
Avert your eyes.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.569
What do you want from me?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.371
Everybody, this is Javier.
New desk clerk.

04:30.404 --> 04:31.505
Hola.

04:31.539 --> 04:35.476
Javier, this is...
everybody.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.680
SAM: Wow.
MORRIS: Nice feather.

04:39.713 --> 04:40.714
The next person

04:40.748 --> 04:42.416
who says a word is dead meat.

04:46.053 --> 04:47.488
(stifled laughter)

05:05.539 --> 05:07.608
Mr. Grant has right flank pain
times three days.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.843
Did you fall,
injure your back?

05:09.877 --> 05:11.945
No, but I'm a building super.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.482
I'm bent over all day
fixing stuff.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.650
Never bothered me
before, though.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.719
Any allergies
or medical conditions?

05:20.521 --> 05:22.523
Anything make the
pain better or worse?

05:22.556 --> 05:25.659
No, I just can't get
comfortable, you know?

05:25.693 --> 05:27.761
I have a little pain
in my groin, too.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.497
He had hematuria
yesterday.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.864
Any fever?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.533
No.

05:32.566 --> 05:35.002
Well, sounds
like a kidney stone.

05:35.035 --> 05:38.606
Oh, no, sweetcakes,
our trip.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.140
Our 20th anniversary's
next week.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.709
Well, you should
be fine by then.

05:41.742 --> 05:42.943
We'll give you
something for the pain

05:42.976 --> 05:44.412
while we do some tests
to confirm.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.446
GRANT:
Okay.
Be right back.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.580
Thanks.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.048
What's your plan?
Morphine.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.651
With an NSAID,
prostaglandin inhibitors

05:50.684 --> 05:52.119
block the ureteral
spasm of renal colic.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.554
Labs?

05:53.587 --> 05:55.689
Uh, just UA to
rule out infection.

05:55.723 --> 05:56.957
CT KUB, no contrast.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.592
Got it.

05:58.626 --> 06:00.728
And by the way,
I love what you've
done with...

06:00.761 --> 06:03.063
Shut up, Grady.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.498
Two more.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.666
Okay, go.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.067
45-year-old male,
renal colic

06:07.100 --> 06:08.836
waiting for CT,

06:08.869 --> 06:10.704
and our diarrhea
and fever guy's better
after hydration.

06:10.738 --> 06:11.705
Ready to fly.

06:11.739 --> 06:12.806
You get a stool culture?
Yep.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.074
C-diff?
Yep.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.810
You all set for the yearbook
pictures later?

06:16.844 --> 06:17.645
Bite me.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.646
(laughs)

06:20.013 --> 06:22.683
So, uh, how we feeling,
Mr. Archibald?

06:22.716 --> 06:23.684
Better, thanks.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.553
Films are back.

06:25.586 --> 06:26.787
Okay, good.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.822
Well, you got
no fracture,
but you got

06:28.856 --> 06:30.891
complete loss
of joint space
bilaterally.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.860
Add a sed rate and
a rheumatoid factor.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.161
Copy that.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.863
What's all that mean?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.065
It means you got bad arthritis
in your hip joints.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.833
All your cartilage
is gone.

06:39.867 --> 06:44.137
Basically, you got bone
grinding on bone.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.574
Tell me something
I don't already know.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.709
Actually, I'm surprised
you can still walk.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.711
How the heck
do you manage
the pain?

06:50.744 --> 06:55.082
Take little steps.
Just tough it out, I guess.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.817
Well, we can help you
with that.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.119
Plus I'm gonna refer you
to the orthopedics clinic.

06:59.152 --> 06:59.953
There's a good chance that
you might need

06:59.987 --> 07:01.922
a hip replacement.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.658
Yeah, that's what they told me
when I was up there last time.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.894
Can't afford the insurance
or the surgery.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.496
How old did you say
you were again?

07:08.496 --> 07:12.700
59. Too young for Medicare.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.968
Frank, can I help you
with something, man?

07:15.002 --> 07:17.738
Could I please have
an autograph, Mr. Archibald?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.140
My pleasure.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.876
Been years since anyone
asked me for one of these.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.712
I used to be
from Cleveland.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.514
The only reason I became
a Miami fan

07:26.514 --> 07:27.781
is 'cause you got
traded down there.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.783
I appreciate that.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.652
Who's this to?

07:31.685 --> 07:34.622
Frank.
F-R-A-N-K.

07:34.655 --> 07:35.989
Uh-huh.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.925
What, you never heard
of Wild Man Willy Archibald?

07:37.958 --> 07:40.728
He was great.
Ate quarterbacks alive.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.696
Run it up the middle,
you can forget that.

07:42.730 --> 07:43.731
You played pro ball, huh?

07:43.764 --> 07:45.032
Ten years.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.034
They don't make 'em
like you anymore.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.035
Thanks a lot.

07:48.068 --> 07:51.605
No, no, thank you.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.974
Holy mother of God,
is that what I think it is?

07:54.007 --> 07:56.810
Super Bowl Eight--
it was a long time ago.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.146
You got three sacks
in that game.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.014
PRATT:
Well, I'll let you
two reminisce.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.049
And I'll be back to talk to you
some more

08:02.082 --> 08:03.651
about that clinic referral.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.118
FRANK:
What was it like
playing for Shula?

08:05.152 --> 08:06.754
Oh, my God,
my cousin used

08:06.787 --> 08:07.755
to live in
the Ninth Ward.

08:07.788 --> 08:08.789
Get out of here!

08:08.822 --> 08:10.958
I can't.
I'm serious.

08:10.991 --> 08:11.759
Dr. Pratt,

08:11.792 --> 08:13.193
GYN has a bed

08:13.226 --> 08:15.195
but they can't take your P.I.D.
for two hours.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.831
Two? She's been down here
for six.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.867
That was my
old 'hood.

08:19.900 --> 08:20.734
DAWN:
Small world.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.035
Telling you.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.672
Dr. Pratt, can you hand me
that chart?

08:24.705 --> 08:26.740
What, your arms broken?

08:26.774 --> 08:28.576
I just got my nails done.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.110
Oh, don't worry, girl,
I got it.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.847
Those tips look
fierce on you.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.082
Thank you, baby.

08:35.115 --> 08:35.883
You're welcome.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.585
(both laugh)

08:40.788 --> 08:41.589
Hey, Tony.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.222
Hey. Hey, listen,

08:43.256 --> 08:46.827
keep the NS running at 150 an
hour till I get up there, okay?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.061
You're back.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.262
Yep, first day.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.964
Every time I think
I'm out,

08:50.998 --> 08:52.833
they pull me back in.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.835
Well, you look good.
How you feel?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.737
Ask me at the end
of my shift.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.839
Thanks for the flowers
and the get well card.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.941
Least I could do.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.944
So how's, uh... how's Ray?

09:03.977 --> 09:07.881
Oh, as far as I know, he's good,
you know, all things considered.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.282
He sent me a letter last week.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.652
Send him my best, huh, Mayday?

09:11.685 --> 09:14.054
Hey, are you ever gonna tell me
why you call me that?

09:14.087 --> 09:17.991
Mayday? She was my favorite
Bond girl.

09:18.025 --> 09:20.728
Grace Jones
in A View To A Kill.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.995
Started off
as a bad guy,

09:22.029 --> 09:23.864
then she saved
the whole world.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.869
Hey, you're lucky.
Could have been Pussy Galore.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.838
I'll see you later.

09:30.871 --> 09:31.739
Yo, Gates.

09:31.772 --> 09:32.973
Bards, what's up, man?

09:33.006 --> 09:34.207
I haven't see you.
Where you been?

09:34.241 --> 09:36.944
Eh, stuck up in the ICU.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.279
So, dude, what's up
with your boy?

09:39.312 --> 09:41.248
Pratt's brother Chaz.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.150
Why, what'd he do?

09:43.183 --> 09:44.051
You didn't hear?

09:45.919 --> 09:47.655
Wow! Love the 'do, Sam--
looks good on you.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.222
Thank you.
Just a little somethin'.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.025
Angie's good, huh?
Yeah. I wish
I would've known

09:52.059 --> 09:53.961
about her when I went brunette--
I could've saved 200 bucks.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.764
Find anybody who
remembers her kid yet?
No, not a soul.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.031
She's taking me later--
I'm getting my pretty boy on

09:58.065 --> 09:59.700
for my last
night with Hope.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.301
I ordered the works
package-- I can't wait.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.037
Gonna take more than the works
to save that mug of yours.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.173
Oh, my God, so mean!

10:06.206 --> 10:08.308
That's his baseline--
you'll get used to it.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.110
I hope not.
Hey, guys.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.112
Care package for Ray.
Whatever you want me

10:12.145 --> 10:14.782
to send, just put in here
by the end of the day.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.049
Oh, that's really
thoughtful, Katey.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.185
How is he?
Oh, pretty incognito.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.420
I think I'm gonna go see him
in a couple of weeks.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.155
Well, look
who it is!

10:22.189 --> 10:23.891
PRATT:
Ah, welcome back.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.292
Hey, stranger!
RASGOTRA:
Hi, guys.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.828
How you feeling?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.129
Oh, a little...

10:29.162 --> 10:30.330
sore, you know?

10:30.363 --> 10:31.331
Oh, my God.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.201
Hi.
I know.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.203
Just don't.
I'll explain later.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.807
Okay. Uh, well, I have
a few things left at your place,

10:39.840 --> 10:41.909
so I'll just come
and pick everything up

10:41.942 --> 10:43.744
tomorrow.
Okay.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.014
Stop looking at me like that.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.048
(chuckles):
I can't help it.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.950
MORRIS:
I think it looks good!

10:49.983 --> 10:51.685
No, I'm serious--
Farrah was my favorite.

10:51.719 --> 10:53.020
Yeah, mine, too.
Same here.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.922
I used to love that poster--
you know

10:54.955 --> 10:56.857
the one I'm talking
about-- the one with
the red bathing suit.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.192
Yeah, with the Mexican-
blanket-thing background.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.360
FRANK: We had that up
in the locker room

11:00.393 --> 11:01.895
at the precinct house--
I used to look

11:01.929 --> 11:03.130
at that every day.
Oh, did I have

11:03.163 --> 11:04.765
some boyhood
fantasies about her!

11:04.798 --> 11:05.899
God, she was hot!
This is totally

11:05.933 --> 11:08.235
creeping me out.
You and me both.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.804
I'll be in the ladies' room
if anyone needs me.
I'll walk with you.

11:10.838 --> 11:15.242
Hey, Frank, would you
please get the lab results
for Mr. Archibald?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.344
Hey, Pratt, can I talk
to you a second?

11:17.377 --> 11:19.412
What's up, Gates?

11:19.446 --> 11:22.349
Uh, well, don't you think
you should've told me
about your brother?

11:22.382 --> 11:24.084
I mean, not that it would've
made a difference--

11:24.117 --> 11:25.853
I still would've
sponsored him--

11:25.886 --> 11:27.855
but, uh, would've been nice
if you said something.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.289
What are you
talking about now?

11:29.322 --> 11:30.758
He's gay.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.125
Yeah? So what?

11:32.159 --> 11:33.827
Oh. You interested?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.929
Come on, Greg.
Come on, Greg, what?

11:35.963 --> 11:38.131
Now, what exactly
was I supposed to say?

11:38.165 --> 11:39.399
I don't know,
"My brother's gay"?

11:39.432 --> 11:42.102
Okay, and then what
would you have done?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.804
Something, gave
him some advice.

11:43.837 --> 11:44.805
Really? Like what?

11:44.838 --> 11:46.339
I don't know, you know,

11:46.373 --> 11:49.009
but now his whole station's
on to it, you know?

11:49.042 --> 11:51.144
I could've done
something before,
made it easier on him.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.445
I don't know,
I'm just saying.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.347
Just say your way
back up to the ICU,

11:54.381 --> 11:57.084
and mind your own
damn business.

11:57.117 --> 11:59.419
Lab results
for Mr. Willie Archibald.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.088
(groans quietly)

12:01.121 --> 12:02.956
(sighs)

12:02.990 --> 12:05.025
Mr. Archibald,
listen to me.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.896
I cannot help you
unless you talk to me.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.163
Now, what is it?

12:10.197 --> 12:13.366
Percocet? Demerol?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.134
Heroin?

12:14.167 --> 12:15.903
Hell, no.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.404
I don't mess with that stuff.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.508
It's Vicodin.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.012
(sighs)

12:25.045 --> 12:26.914
Where'd you get
the prescription?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.181
My mom gets it for me.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.117
She's on Medicare.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.319
I can't afford that stuff
on $7.50 an hour.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.353
Mr. Archibald...

12:33.386 --> 12:36.824
You don't know how I feel!

12:36.857 --> 12:37.457
I can barely walk,

12:37.490 --> 12:39.326
it hurts so much.

12:39.359 --> 12:43.363
Got laid off 'cause I couldn't
patrol a damn warehouse.

12:43.396 --> 12:47.200
So I get a messenger job--
figure I can still drive, right?

12:47.234 --> 12:49.069
Now I can
barely do that.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.971
How long have you
been on the Vicodin?

12:51.004 --> 12:53.273
(groans softly):
Years.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.976
I need three, four a day.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.979
It used to knock me out,
but it doesn't do that anymore.

12:59.012 --> 13:02.415
Mr. Archibald, painkillers
are very, very addictive.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.118
What the hell
you want me to do, Doc?

13:05.152 --> 13:07.354
Soon my mom is gonna be
driving me around.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.189
She's 80, man.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.291
Alright. I can get you
on a surgery list here.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.961
It's free of charge.
I'm on the damn list.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.396
It's a 18-month wait.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.231
A private hospital
would take you tomorrow

13:18.265 --> 13:20.300
if you had the money.

13:20.333 --> 13:24.037
Are you saying that you
have absolutely no assets?

13:24.071 --> 13:26.339
Just the house I bought my mom.

13:26.373 --> 13:27.540
And I'm not selling that.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.511
(exhales):
Well, I can't allow you

13:31.544 --> 13:34.948
to keep popping Vicodin
like it's candy.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.449
I'll, uh, see
what I can do

13:36.483 --> 13:40.253
to get get you bumped
up on the county list.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.122
(sighs)

13:46.459 --> 13:48.228
Here.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.598
It's worth a lot.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.003
It's real diamonds
and gold.

13:58.205 --> 14:01.975
Maybe someone'll take it
as a payment for the surgery.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.977
Put it up on that eBay
or something.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.246
Mr. Archibald, I cannot...

14:06.279 --> 14:08.281
Please, Doc...

14:08.315 --> 14:11.118
I can't live with this pain
any longer.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.452
Please.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.363
(sniffles)

14:26.066 --> 14:28.035
(cell phone rings)

14:28.068 --> 14:31.138
Hello?

14:31.171 --> 14:34.174
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wh-What happened?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.309
Is he okay?

14:36.343 --> 14:38.078
Where are you?

14:38.111 --> 14:40.280
Alright, I'm on my way.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.317
GRADY:
Dr. Lockhart,

14:44.351 --> 14:45.085
I really need...

14:45.118 --> 14:46.053
Ask Pratt.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.054
He told me
to ask you.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.191
Hey, Abby, what's up
with your foot lac in two?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.225
It's not gonna
suture itself.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.630
TANYA (sobbing):
He... he...

14:57.664 --> 15:00.000
He fell! He just...
GRADY:
You told me to be persistent

15:00.033 --> 15:02.335
and that's what I'm trying to do
Give him to me,
give him to me.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.336
Come on. Oh, God.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.172
Get the door.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.639
Get the door!

15:21.221 --> 15:23.390
MARY:
Excuse me, have you
seen our doctor?

15:23.423 --> 15:26.994
Ma'am someone'll be
right with you.
She said she'd be right back.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.562
I got the pedes cuff.
Oh, God, come on, baby,
wake up, please.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.232
Pupils are equal
and reactive.
How far did he fall?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.234
From the bridge part
of the jungle gym.
How many feet?

15:34.267 --> 15:35.535
I don't know, maybe six.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.437
Spontaneous resps,
but have that bag ready.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.007
Did he just move?
Morris, did you see that?
He sure did.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.374
Extremities
look good.
Okay.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.543
Come on, Joe, come on,
Joe, open your eyes.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.445
He's gonna be Alright,
isn't he?
We don't know yet.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.447
Got a BP-- 78/42.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.449
Did he move or cry
or anything?

15:49.482 --> 15:51.251
No.
Sats 98.
Three-centimeter lac

15:51.284 --> 15:53.020
in the forehead.
I'll set up
to irrigate.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.521
Did he...
did he fall on his head?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.089
I don't know.
I didn't see.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.557
What do you mean,
you didn't see?

15:57.590 --> 15:59.259
Were you watching him?
I mean, that's your job,

15:59.292 --> 16:00.727
isn't it?
I'm so sorry.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.295
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's alright.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.330
You should just go.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.631
Oh, please, I want to stay.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.366
I'll let you
know how he is.
Abby,

16:06.399 --> 16:07.600
we're gonna do
everything, okay?

16:07.634 --> 16:10.203
He's gonna get
the best that we got.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.738
So, you sure
you got everything?

16:11.771 --> 16:14.274
Yeah. Let's get out of here.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.376
Hey, not so fast, speedy--
we got a few things

16:16.409 --> 16:18.245
to discuss
before you leave.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.746
It's Johns Hopkins.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.481
Something went wrong,
I didn't get in.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.550
I anticipated this.
Relax, I...

16:23.583 --> 16:27.054
faxed your consent forms--
and I warned them about you,
you little card shark.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.322
I got a guy over there who's
gonna win my money back.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.092
Texas Hold 'Em
isn't your game.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.493
Alright, I got some news.

16:33.526 --> 16:36.063
Good news, bad news--
what do you want first?

16:36.096 --> 16:39.199
Bad. I like to end on an up.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.567
Alright, well,
the bad news is,

16:40.600 --> 16:42.402
you can't go home
and pack for Baltimore--

16:42.435 --> 16:44.304
there's something
you have to do.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.140
And the good news is a surprise.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.541
What is it?

16:48.575 --> 16:50.277
Well, if I tell you,
it'll kind of ruin

16:50.310 --> 16:51.811
the whole surprise element,
wouldn't it?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.281
Don't worry,
you're gonna love it.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.216
Y-You're in
on this, too?
Alright, enough yakking.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.584
Let's go, come on,
we got stuff to do.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.586
Look out! Clear out!

16:59.619 --> 17:02.289
FRANK:
It's too bad they don't take
better care of the old guys.

17:02.322 --> 17:04.357
You know, if it wasn't
for guys like Willie Archibald

17:04.391 --> 17:06.159
putting their bodies
on the line,

17:06.193 --> 17:08.560
there wouldn't be an NFL--
it's a damn shame.

17:08.595 --> 17:11.098
It's a damn shame he didn't
save some of that money.

17:11.131 --> 17:14.501
Hey, a guy was lucky to make
35 G's a year back then,

17:14.534 --> 17:16.169
not like these
multimillion-dollar
clowns today,

17:16.203 --> 17:18.637
half of 'em crybabies
and criminals.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.675
May I hold it?

17:24.844 --> 17:26.445
Yeah.

17:26.479 --> 17:30.183
Wow.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.119
You know, I heard Ditka himself

17:32.152 --> 17:34.187
auctioned off
his NFC Championship ring,

17:34.221 --> 17:35.755
help out some
of the old players.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.527
This is priceless.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.829
This is earned
with sweat and blood

17:42.862 --> 17:45.332
in the trenches of the gridiron.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.467
You can't sell it.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.602
Dr. Pratt, chemo-boy
pulled his central line.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.304
He's bleeding
all over curtain four.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.440
And there's a rig
ten minutes out.
Alright.

17:56.509 --> 17:57.477
(sighs)

18:00.380 --> 18:01.448
(sighs)

18:01.481 --> 18:03.650
(distant crying)

18:03.683 --> 18:05.552
Hey, how's Joe?
You know, I can
get somebody else

18:05.585 --> 18:07.487
to take that rig that's coming
in if you need me in there.

18:07.520 --> 18:08.855
Woke up crying,
purposeful movements.

18:08.888 --> 18:09.856
Morris has got him.

18:12.192 --> 18:15.862
(Joe crying loudly)
Hey, I brought two gowns
in case he throws up again.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.630
Six-oh nylon...
Luka, hi, it's me...

18:17.664 --> 18:22.235
Um, Joe, uh, fell and, uh,
hit his head in the park today.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.437
But he's awake now,
we're at the hospital.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.373
(loud crying continues)
He, um...

18:26.406 --> 18:29.709
Um, could you just call me
as soon as you get this message?

18:29.742 --> 18:32.212
Bye.
It's okay, Abby--
he'll call you back.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.380
(crying continues)

18:33.413 --> 18:35.282
Could you hold
his head still?

18:35.315 --> 18:37.384
Wait, wait, what are you doing,
what are you doing?

18:37.417 --> 18:40.553
Closing the lac.
Shh. No. I'll do it.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.190
He's an intern.
Yeah, who knows how to
Dermabond the laceration.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.492
No, I know, I know, but what
if it gets infected or he gets

18:45.525 --> 18:48.261
a big, giant scar-- you want
to be responsible for that?

18:48.295 --> 18:49.396
Better me than you.

18:49.429 --> 18:50.563
You sure about that?

18:50.597 --> 18:51.931
He's right, Abby.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.566
Alright, Chuny,
call CT, let 'em know

18:53.600 --> 18:55.435
we're on our way up.
No. No CT.

18:55.468 --> 18:56.469
We agreed we'd just observe.

18:56.503 --> 18:57.937
Yeah, before he vomited.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.207
Yeah, no, it's too
much radiation--
no one knows

19:00.207 --> 19:01.441
the long-term effects.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.209
Morris,

19:02.209 --> 19:03.943
we over-CT kids.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.513
We've had this discussion
a thousand times.
Yeah, LOC,

19:06.546 --> 19:08.281
vomiting-- you know
he needs a scan.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.217
His vitals are good,
his mental status is fine,

19:10.250 --> 19:13.520
the LOC was transient--
observation is enough.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.555
It's not a head bleed--
the mechanism just isn't there.

19:15.588 --> 19:19.226
Okay, if this was your
patient and not your
son, what would you do?

19:19.259 --> 19:20.960
(crying continues)

19:20.993 --> 19:22.795
Alright,
no peeking.
(laughs):
I'm not.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.697
You better not be.
Okay, you ready?

19:24.731 --> 19:26.366
I was ready
a half hour ago.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.236
Alright, take
your hands down.

19:29.236 --> 19:30.703
(laughs)

19:30.737 --> 19:32.672
Look at this-- front row,
third-base line,

19:32.705 --> 19:34.507
right behind
the on-deck circle.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.476
You can't afford those tickets
on your salary.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.445
It's not how much you
make, my young friend,

19:38.478 --> 19:40.847
it's who you know.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.983
We'll have him in and out
as soon as we can.

19:44.016 --> 19:47.454
I'll stay and give you
an immediate read.
Thanks.

19:47.487 --> 19:50.657
No I.V.?
He was doing so good, we
didn't think we needed one.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.692
We should get one in
so we can get started.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.594
Usually a little whiff
of ketamine does the trick.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.397
Yeah, um, I-I don't
want to sedate him.

19:58.798 --> 20:01.000
It's only gonna take
a few seconds, right?

20:01.033 --> 20:05.605
I've scanned a lot of toddlers--
trust me, you want the drugs.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.740
I can do it in
one needle stick,
Abby, I promise.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.410
No. Hypoventilation,
drug allergies--

20:10.443 --> 20:11.944
it's just not worth the risk.
You know, we can't

20:11.978 --> 20:14.747
get a good look unless
he holds completely still.

20:14.781 --> 20:18.318
(crying continues)
Yeah. Can you, uh,
pass me that? Shh.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.686
Thank you.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.622
I just... I just want
to try something, okay?

20:22.655 --> 20:24.457
Shh, shh. There you go.

20:24.491 --> 20:25.758
And if it doesn't work,
you can sedate him.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.527
Just let me try, okay?

20:27.560 --> 20:30.330
Okay.
Hey, look.
Look at this.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.965
Yeah. And this one, too.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.335
(crying stops)
And what about this?

20:35.368 --> 20:36.736
(gasps)

20:36.769 --> 20:39.038
(whispers):
Remember this book?

20:39.071 --> 20:41.308
Daddy Takes a Trip.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.375
Huh?

20:42.409 --> 20:44.377
(gasps):
"This is me

20:44.411 --> 20:47.480
when I was your age, Joe."

20:47.514 --> 20:49.048
What do you think?
Do you...

20:49.081 --> 20:50.383
(gasps):
What's that?

20:50.417 --> 20:53.420
"This is me
and your Uncle Niko.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.622
We love the beach."

20:55.655 --> 20:58.057
Do you see them on
the beach, right there?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.393
(machine humming)

21:00.427 --> 21:03.062
(gasps):
Who's that? Who's that?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.697
"This is me,

21:04.731 --> 21:06.966
your dad, missing you,
wishing you were here."

21:11.838 --> 21:14.507
These seats are exceptional.

21:14.541 --> 21:16.809
I've never sat
this close before.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.679
You're welcome.
Man...

21:19.712 --> 21:21.348
Excuse me. You Josh?

21:25.718 --> 21:26.586
Stand up.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.455
Yeah, this is Josh.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.022
I'm Tony Gates.
How you doing?
Nice to meet you.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.090
Josh Lipnicki.
Hey, Josh.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.559
His mom, Serena.
Hi.
Hi.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.526
Derrek Lee.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.594
This is for you,
buddy.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.096
The whole team
signed it.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.698
Thanks, Mr. Lee.

21:38.731 --> 21:42.101
Good luck in Baltimore.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.102
Mr. Lee...

21:43.135 --> 21:44.504
Yeah?

21:44.537 --> 21:45.738
You know, I got
to tell you,

21:45.772 --> 21:47.807
your opponents have
a statistical tendency

21:47.840 --> 21:49.709
to pitch you high
and outside.

21:49.742 --> 21:51.478
And the wind's blowing
out today,

21:51.511 --> 21:53.480
so if you lay off
that stuff

21:53.513 --> 21:54.681
you'll murder 'em.

21:54.714 --> 21:56.082
Alright,
I'll keep that in mind.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.588
I don't know what to say.

22:01.621 --> 22:02.855
That's a first.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.591
Pretty cool, huh?

22:04.624 --> 22:07.627
Yes, this definitely
qualifies as cool.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.728
Nice.

22:10.397 --> 22:12.399
(murmuring)

22:15.134 --> 22:16.869
No answer?

22:16.903 --> 22:18.838
Well, by the time
you reach him

22:18.871 --> 22:22.909
all you're going
to have is good news.

22:22.942 --> 22:25.111
You know, I thought
the NICU was tough.

22:25.144 --> 22:28.748
At least both
of us were there.

22:28.781 --> 22:32.151
When he was brand new,
I didn't even know him yet.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.687
But now he's...
he's Joe.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.559
BETTINA:
Okay, so Abby...

22:39.592 --> 22:40.693
What?

22:40.727 --> 22:42.028
There's no subdural,
no epidural,

22:42.061 --> 22:43.596
the grey-white junctions

22:43.630 --> 22:45.765
and sulci look sharp,
and there's no evidence

22:45.798 --> 22:47.567
of diffuse axonal injury.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.901
That's good, right?

22:48.935 --> 22:50.503
But?

22:50.537 --> 22:52.672
There is a subtle
high-density irregularity

22:52.705 --> 22:54.173
in the left parietal region.

22:54.206 --> 22:55.041
It's small,

22:55.074 --> 22:56.676
and it could be nothing,

22:56.709 --> 22:58.845
but since it correlates with
the location of his injury

22:58.878 --> 23:03.583
I think we're obliged
to check it out with an MRI.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.652
So after all this, we
have to sedate him anyway?

23:05.685 --> 23:07.053
We need him still
for at least 45 minutes.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.788
I know.
We'll take him

23:08.821 --> 23:10.957
back down to the ER. We'll have
Chuny start the I.V.

23:10.990 --> 23:12.792
She's the best needle stick
in town.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.762
I want LMX cream.

23:15.795 --> 23:16.663
TAGGART:
Okay, I'll put it on now--

23:16.696 --> 23:17.964
give it time to work.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.968
He's got an 18 gauge in the
right antecubital fossa,

23:22.001 --> 23:23.770
got 40 of lasix en route.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.605
Alright, we got it.

23:25.638 --> 23:28.775
Make yourself useful and go
refill the airway box, rookie.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.611
Hey, come hit me later,
we gotta talk.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.813
BP 194/126.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.214
So CHF exacerbation.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.783
He already got lasix.
What's next?

23:36.816 --> 23:39.552
Afterload reduction?
Nitro drip?

23:39.586 --> 23:42.489
Hey! Hey, man, what
the hell is this?
You got something

23:42.489 --> 23:43.756
you want to say to me?
I thought you
might like them.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.725
You can wear them
for your boyfriend.

23:45.758 --> 23:48.695
Man, I swear to God, I'll beat
your punk ass into next week!

23:48.728 --> 23:50.863
I'm right here, rook, come on.
Let's go, huh?

23:53.533 --> 23:55.201
You alright?
I'm fine.

23:55.234 --> 23:56.603
Geez, I was just kidding around.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.209
Greg, can you
get out of here?
What?

24:03.242 --> 24:04.511
Get out of here,
man. I'm fine.

24:18.791 --> 24:19.892
(crying)

24:19.926 --> 24:21.060
I always open up
a second kit.

24:21.093 --> 24:23.262
That way I'll never
need it, you know?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.732
Here 's your flush.
Shh.

24:25.765 --> 24:27.634
I hate this.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.636
I'll make it quick.

24:29.669 --> 24:30.903
Shh, shh.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.639
Okay, ¿listo, Joe?

24:32.672 --> 24:34.240
No pasa nada, mi amor.
No pasa nada.

24:34.273 --> 24:36.142
Come on, baby.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.545
Oh, God, I don't think
I can watch this.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.880
You don't have
to be in here, you know.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.882
I know, but I don't want
to desert him.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.151
You won't be the first mom
that can't watch, Abby,
you know that.

24:45.184 --> 24:50.122
We can go right next door.
I'll sit with you, okay?

24:50.156 --> 24:50.957
Listen, baby, I love you.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.960
(crying continues)

24:53.993 --> 24:55.828
(wailing)

24:58.931 --> 25:00.867
(crying continues)

25:06.305 --> 25:07.840
(sighs)

25:07.874 --> 25:10.877
MARQUEZ: It's okay.
It's okay, baby.

25:10.910 --> 25:14.581
I remember when
Alex was three...

25:14.581 --> 25:18.585
We went to one of those bounce
houses at the carnival.

25:18.618 --> 25:20.653
And of course he's
in there with a bunch

25:20.687 --> 25:22.722
of five and six-year-old kids,

25:22.755 --> 25:25.157
so he gets
knocked down, right?

25:25.191 --> 25:28.060
Every time he goes to get up
he gets knocked down again.

25:28.094 --> 25:32.665
And he's crying,
"Mommy! Mommy!"

25:32.699 --> 25:34.166
And the attendant won't
let me in because

25:34.200 --> 25:35.935
he thinks I'm some
stupid teenager, right?

25:38.370 --> 25:40.740
So, what'd you do?

25:42.842 --> 25:47.947
I stood there
and I cheered him on.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.916
And every time he got
knocked down

25:49.949 --> 25:52.318
I told him,
"I know you can get up."

25:54.220 --> 25:57.624
But that's when it hit me.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.831
They fall.
(crying continues)

26:04.864 --> 26:08.868
And all you can do is be there
and hope they keep getting up.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.338
(crying continues)
MARQUEZ:
Shh, shh.

26:15.007 --> 26:18.344
(sighs)

26:18.377 --> 26:19.211
Just keep some ice
on it, okay?

26:19.245 --> 26:20.780
You should be fine.

26:20.813 --> 26:23.015
I was just breaking
the kid's balls, you know?

26:23.049 --> 26:25.818
It was a joke.
Jokes are supposed
to be funny.

26:25.852 --> 26:28.721
Come back in a few days and
I'll check your eye out again.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.322
Hey, I got empty
chairs in there.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.291
Come on, who's up
for some pampering?

26:32.324 --> 26:33.392
It's not really
my style.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.162
End of my shift,
I am there, Ange.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.864
How about you, huh?

26:37.897 --> 26:40.032
I could wax those brows--
make you look ten years younger.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.868
You should do it.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.203
It's like you've got two
caterpillars over your eyes.

26:44.236 --> 26:45.738
No, thank you.

26:45.772 --> 26:47.273
Unlike the rest of you
good-for-nothings

26:47.306 --> 26:49.241
I'm not vain about
my appearance.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.844
Well, that must make
it easier.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.913
How'd you get this
bum wing, Reggie?

26:53.946 --> 26:55.682
Fell out
of my desk.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.016
He dozed off
at school.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.818
Fell out of his
desk during math.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.853
He hasn't been sleeping
well at home.

27:00.887 --> 27:03.856
He's afraid the boogeyman's
going to get him. Baby!

27:03.890 --> 27:06.025
Tommy.
Does this hurt?

27:06.058 --> 27:07.694
Boogeyman, huh?

27:07.694 --> 27:09.328
You know there's
no such thing, buddy.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.330
I've seen him.
You've seen him?

27:11.363 --> 27:12.799
What does he look like?

27:12.832 --> 27:16.335
He's green... big eyes,
crazy hair.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.305
Oh. Well, no point tenderness.
He's got full range of motion.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.373
I don't think it's broken.
And why didn't you say

27:21.407 --> 27:22.975
it was a green boogeyman
in the first place?

27:23.009 --> 27:25.011
I got something that will
fix that right up.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.379
Dr. Morris, kidney
stone guy in Curtain
2 doesn't look so good.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.881
Okay, I'll be right back, buddy.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.983
What kidney stone guy?
Abby's patient.

27:31.017 --> 27:33.319
Gross hematuria, dropped
his pressure, diaphoretic.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.086
Where's my doctor?

27:34.120 --> 27:35.287
BP 80/50.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.288
MARY:
What's wrong?
He was fine.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.024
Did he get
narcotics?

27:38.057 --> 27:39.926
Five milligrams
of morphine three
hours ago.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.160
Bolus a liter of saline.

27:41.193 --> 27:42.161
What are his labs?

27:42.194 --> 27:43.796
They only
sent a UA.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.765
My back...
Stat hemocue,
chemistry and EKG.

27:45.798 --> 27:46.833
Are those films?

27:46.866 --> 27:48.735
Yeah, Abby didn't
see them.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.469
Dr. Lockhart said it was just a
kidney stone and he'd be fine.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.371
Uh, hello, ma'am,
I'm Dr. Morris.

27:52.404 --> 27:55.074
I'm afraid a kidney stone
isn't the problem.
What?

27:55.107 --> 27:56.075
Get surgery down
here right away.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.844
Surgery? He needs surgery?

27:57.877 --> 28:00.046
Your husband has a mass
in the kidney.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.781
A mass like a tumor?

28:01.814 --> 28:02.949
Hemocue 8.1.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.483
Too soon to say, but maybe.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.753
Type and cross two units.

28:06.753 --> 28:07.954
Oh, my God,
she said he was okay.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.957
(groaning)

28:10.990 --> 28:13.025
(machine clanging)

28:26.372 --> 28:28.107
Like I said, the program
is free of charge.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.042
It meets three times a week
here at the hospital.

28:30.076 --> 28:33.045
If you can commit to that,
get weaned off the Vicodin

28:33.079 --> 28:35.347
then we can do this.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.849
I don't know, Doc.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.785
What if the procedure
don't work?

28:38.785 --> 28:43.022
It will. Just promise me
you'll lay off the pills.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.991
Okay, deal.

28:45.024 --> 28:45.892
What do I got
to do?

28:45.925 --> 28:47.526
I pulled some strings.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.962
Ortho bumped you higher on the
list for a hip replacement.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.864
But for now we're going
to put a needle

28:51.898 --> 28:53.833
into your joint
under X-ray guidance.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.334
Come on, I'll help you.

28:55.367 --> 28:59.005
Yeah, team docs used to
stick us all the time.

28:59.038 --> 29:00.840
This isn't quite
the same.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.341
What we're going to do
is something called

29:02.374 --> 29:04.143
an intra-articular injection.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.412
We put in a long-acting
anesthetic and steroid,

29:06.445 --> 29:07.814
it kills the pain
for a month.

29:07.814 --> 29:09.148
Damn.

29:09.181 --> 29:11.017
And if you don't get your
surgery by then,

29:11.050 --> 29:14.821
you come back
in, we do it
all over again.

29:14.854 --> 29:15.888
Cool?

29:18.925 --> 29:20.059
Thanks, Doc.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.393
You're welcome.

29:21.427 --> 29:23.529
Now I just need you
to sign here to consent.

29:28.067 --> 29:30.903
Alright. Now let's
get you on your side
so I can prep you.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.471
Come on.

29:32.504 --> 29:33.572
(groans)

29:33.605 --> 29:35.441
I just got
to let you know

29:35.474 --> 29:38.577
that there's a very small chance
of bleeding and infection.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.579
But the benefits far
outweigh the risks.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.581
Is it going to hurt?

29:42.614 --> 29:45.017
No, we numb the skin up first.

29:45.051 --> 29:46.552
Hey.
Hey there.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.220
How many of these
have you done before?

29:48.254 --> 29:50.522
Oh, I'm not doing
this, she is.

29:50.556 --> 29:51.490
Hello, Mr. Archibald.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.060
I'm Doctor DeJesus.

29:54.093 --> 29:57.196
Well, in that case you may
have to leave the room, Doc.

29:57.229 --> 29:58.965
Pressure's 75/40.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.467
Call for another two units.

30:01.500 --> 30:05.004
No, no, sweetie...
there's so much blood...

30:05.037 --> 30:07.073
MORRIS:
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.141
Dawn, take her in
the Family Room, please.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.476
Is it blunt trauma?

30:10.509 --> 30:12.411
No, renal mass eroding
into the vessels.

30:12.444 --> 30:13.545
Hemorrhaging around
his kidney.

30:13.579 --> 30:14.914
Yeah, we know.
He needs surgery.

30:14.947 --> 30:16.215
Central line kit, please.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.884
Crit's dropping
despite transfusions.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.052
He doesn't need a
central line, he
needs the OR.

30:20.086 --> 30:23.890
Wait. Hang a unit of FFP.
If we keep sitting on him
he's going to crash.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.158
What's your plan, Neela?
5 French femoral
sheath, please.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.094
I'm going to inflate the
angioplasty balloon in
the renal artery.

30:28.127 --> 30:30.229
If I cut off the blood
supply to his kidney,

30:30.262 --> 30:31.964
get his pressure up,
he'll have a much better chance

30:31.998 --> 30:33.099
of success in the OR.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.967
Ballsy.
Or stupid.

30:35.001 --> 30:36.235
MORRIS:
Okay, let's call

30:36.268 --> 30:37.169
for a C-arm.

30:37.203 --> 30:38.570
Neela, you're up.

30:46.078 --> 30:49.081
(fans cheering)

30:50.950 --> 30:52.018
Whoo!

30:58.290 --> 31:02.128
(cheering)

31:08.200 --> 31:10.536
You're a good luck charm.

31:10.569 --> 31:13.005
RASGOTRA:
The guide wire's in
the femoral artery.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.673
Excellent.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.109
Advancing
a six-millimeter balloon.

31:17.143 --> 31:18.644
Last hemoglobin
is 8.5.

31:18.677 --> 31:20.546
Dropping, he's losing
more blood.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.481
Not for long. Morris,
can you inflate the
balloon, please?

31:22.514 --> 31:24.516
Yeah.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.289
Looks good.

31:30.322 --> 31:32.224
Okay, fluoro off.

31:32.258 --> 31:34.593
Could've done a nephrectomy
by now.

31:34.626 --> 31:38.264
Or he could've had an MI,
or a stroke because he was
too unstable for surgery.

31:38.297 --> 31:39.966
DAWN:
Pressure's up,
95 over 60.

31:39.966 --> 31:41.233
Best it's been.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.135
Rasgotra shoots and scores.
Nice job.

31:43.169 --> 31:44.703
Move him up to the OR,
I'll be right up.

31:44.736 --> 31:45.571
Have the blood bank

31:45.604 --> 31:48.307
stay ahead four units.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.675
You got lucky.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.010
So this is about the patient,

31:51.043 --> 31:55.114
is it?

31:55.147 --> 31:56.983
You know...

31:56.983 --> 31:59.151
when Ray got hurt, I was
in a lot of shock.

31:59.185 --> 32:00.252
We all were.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.687
Poor you.

32:01.720 --> 32:04.056
What happened to Ray
had nothing to do with me.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.158
He's the one that got
piss drunk at Abby's wedding.

32:06.192 --> 32:09.028
He's the one who stumbled
in front of that truck, not me.

32:09.061 --> 32:10.296
Even he says that.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.164
You done?

32:12.198 --> 32:14.333
You know, you can hate me
as much as you like.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.735
I couldn't care less.
But I will not take the blame

32:16.768 --> 32:19.071
for what happened to Ray,
have you got that?

32:37.789 --> 32:40.192
So how's he doing?

32:40.226 --> 32:43.662
He's just coming
out of it.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.098
How about you?

32:46.132 --> 32:47.066
I've been better.

32:47.099 --> 32:48.234
(sniffles)

32:48.267 --> 32:50.202
Talk to Luka yet?

32:53.139 --> 32:59.145
You know, it's totally different
when it's your kid on the table.

32:59.178 --> 33:03.315
And it would be a lot easier
if I wasn't doing this alone.

33:03.349 --> 33:06.752
Baby Joe's gonna be
just fine.

33:06.785 --> 33:08.654
And you are not alone.

33:14.260 --> 33:15.394
(door opens)

33:15.427 --> 33:17.129
TAGGART: I just got
this from Betina.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.265
She apologized
for not coming down.

33:19.298 --> 33:21.267
Normal parenchymal tissue.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.134
No blood or edema.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.402
Okay.

33:23.435 --> 33:26.205
PRATT: What'd I tell
you? (chuckles)

33:26.238 --> 33:28.207
God!

33:39.085 --> 33:40.486
No, really, I feel much better.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.388
I just... I have to be there
when he wakes up.

33:42.421 --> 33:44.723
I understand.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.426
Oh, God, what if it's malignant?

33:47.459 --> 33:48.727
One thing
at a time.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.662
Let's get him through
the operation first.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.131
I'll take you upstairs.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.400
The surgeons will answer
all your questions.

33:58.137 --> 33:59.805
We missed a
six-centimeter mass?

33:59.838 --> 34:01.807
You can't catch
everything.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.442
Dr. Morris, that thing
was gigantic.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.511
Was that my kidney
stone patient's wife?

34:05.544 --> 34:09.781
Uh... yeah.
Yeah, I think so.

34:09.815 --> 34:12.118
I've got some charts
I should go finish.

34:15.121 --> 34:16.487
Where is he?

34:16.522 --> 34:17.623
Who?

34:17.656 --> 34:19.391
Oh, uh, well,
he needed surgery.

34:19.425 --> 34:20.525
What?

34:20.559 --> 34:21.693
No, it's nothing.
We caught it.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.495
Morris!
Don't worry about it.

34:23.529 --> 34:25.130
What, you don't have
enough on your plate today?

34:25.130 --> 34:26.831
Morris, what is it?
Come on.

34:29.801 --> 34:31.303
Probable renal cell carcinoma.

34:34.172 --> 34:35.574
Oh, my God.

34:35.607 --> 34:37.775
Abby, Abby, that guy's tumor
was not your fault.

34:37.809 --> 34:39.178
Okay? We're not even sure
if it's malignant.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.712
I told him he was
gonna be fine.

34:40.746 --> 34:42.714
Well, we handled it!

34:42.748 --> 34:44.150
We're a team.

34:44.183 --> 34:46.818
We back each other up.

34:46.851 --> 34:47.819
Now go home,
get some rest.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.155
Take care of your boy.

34:49.188 --> 34:51.223
Don't beat yourself up
over this.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.224
See you later.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.625
Bye. Thanks for everything.

34:53.659 --> 34:54.326
Bye, sweetie.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.161
Thank you.

35:08.207 --> 35:11.377
20 minutes and I will be
in the capable hands of Angie,

35:11.410 --> 35:12.578
upgraded to
the premium package.

35:12.611 --> 35:14.180
What are you doing?

35:14.180 --> 35:16.448
Oh, it's for a kid
I got who can't sleep.

35:16.482 --> 35:18.184
Chronic boogeyman problem.

35:18.217 --> 35:19.918
MARQUEZ: So you're
giving him candy?
No.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.688
Well, yes, but he doesn't
know that it's candy.

35:22.721 --> 35:25.724
I'm gonna tell him
it's boogeyman repellant.

35:25.757 --> 35:28.594
Genius, right?
It's a lie.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.530
Sam, let me tell you
about a little thing
that we like to call

35:31.563 --> 35:33.665
the placebo effect.

35:33.699 --> 35:34.666
They look like M&Ms.

35:34.700 --> 35:35.801
Yeah, yeah,
they do that

35:35.834 --> 35:37.636
to cover up
the taste.

35:37.669 --> 35:41.307
The methyl chloride
anti-noxazine

35:41.340 --> 35:42.874
is very bitter
in pure form. Ech!

35:47.279 --> 35:48.780
It tastes like M&Ms, too.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.616
Cool, huh?

35:50.649 --> 35:52.484
Whoa, whoa. No, never take
more than two,

35:52.518 --> 35:53.885
right before
you brush your teeth.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.587
Okay, there's a three-week
supply there,

35:55.621 --> 35:57.223
so make 'em last.

35:57.223 --> 35:57.889
Thanks, Dr. Morris.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.358
You bet.

35:59.391 --> 36:00.892
Just hang for a little
while longer.

36:00.926 --> 36:03.429
We'll get you guys moving out
as soon as we can.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.699
Hi, uh, it's me again.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.935
(sighs) Um...

36:09.968 --> 36:14.540
I still don't know
where you are.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.242
Maybe you're at the hospital.

36:16.242 --> 36:17.609
Uh, I hope everything's okay.

36:17.643 --> 36:18.944
But Joe is fine.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.679
The MRI was clear,

36:20.712 --> 36:24.916
so you can just ignore
all my other panicked messages.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.419
Um, we're on our way home.

36:27.453 --> 36:30.522
We'll be there in about 20
minutes, so call us. Bye.

36:34.726 --> 36:36.662
(horn honks, tires screech)

36:39.030 --> 36:40.566
MAN:
You stupid bitch!

36:40.599 --> 36:41.467
What's the matter with you?!

36:41.500 --> 36:42.301
You could have killed us!

36:42.334 --> 36:45.271
(Joe crying)

37:02.854 --> 37:04.290
Hey, guys.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.291
Hey, Pratt.
Excuse me.

37:05.324 --> 37:07.459
What's going on?

37:19.338 --> 37:20.839
Excuse me,
Dr. Pratt.
Yep?

37:20.872 --> 37:22.574
Is your brother
single?

37:24.042 --> 37:25.677
You're gonna have
to check with him.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.446
(both chuckle)

37:27.479 --> 37:28.447
Good night.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.348
Good night.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.982
And I will.

37:33.552 --> 37:37.323
MORRIS:
See you tomorrow, buddy.

37:37.356 --> 37:38.023
Morris?

37:38.056 --> 37:39.758
Yeah.

37:39.791 --> 37:40.926
What are you doing
back there?

37:40.959 --> 37:42.494
I'm getting
my treatments.

37:42.528 --> 37:44.763
You should really stay
and have something done.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.698
No, I'm good.
You take it easy.

37:46.732 --> 37:47.533
Suit yourself.

37:49.801 --> 37:51.069
Oh, hey, Dr. Moretti,
welcome back.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.738
How was the conference?

37:52.771 --> 37:54.873
Oh, you know, the EM Research
Symposium

37:54.906 --> 37:56.708
is no mere conference,
Dr. Pratt.

37:56.742 --> 37:58.544
It is a magical week
where some

37:58.577 --> 38:00.912
of the greatest research minds
in the country get together

38:00.946 --> 38:04.049
to exchange ideas
and knowledge and...

38:04.082 --> 38:05.751
Big waste of time, huh?

38:05.784 --> 38:06.852
Yeah.

38:06.885 --> 38:07.919
Oh, hey...

38:07.953 --> 38:09.788
your boy Gates
picked up

38:09.821 --> 38:12.358
Von Willebrands
on a trauma patient.

38:12.391 --> 38:14.025
ICU must be doing him
some good.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.664
Always a pleasure
talking to you.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.501
(sighs)

38:25.704 --> 38:26.772
Hey.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.810
So where's your partner?

38:31.843 --> 38:33.779
Lunch.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.049
Chaz, why you ignore me, man?

38:40.586 --> 38:42.554
You really don't know?

38:48.560 --> 38:51.096
You made me look
like a bitch, Greg.

38:51.129 --> 38:52.564
What?

38:52.598 --> 38:54.900
I don't need you
to fight my battles.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.435
I can take care
of myself.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.670
Come on, man,
it wasn't even like that.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.407
How you gonna sit there and try
to tell me what it's like?

39:02.574 --> 39:05.010
Do they call you faggot here?

39:05.043 --> 39:06.545
Do they, do they

39:06.578 --> 39:07.779
whistle at you
in the shower, too?

39:07.813 --> 39:11.550
Listen, I just reacted, man.

39:11.583 --> 39:13.652
I saw my little brother getting
pushed around

39:13.685 --> 39:17.088
and a switch flipped.

39:17.122 --> 39:20.426
Come on, man, you know what
I'm saying. You're my family.

39:20.426 --> 39:22.694
I know you probably thought
you were helping,

39:22.728 --> 39:25.096
and I appreciate it,

39:25.130 --> 39:28.734
but if my big brother the doctor
comes to the rescue,

39:28.767 --> 39:31.102
then they're gonna
respect you.

39:31.136 --> 39:34.606
If I stand up for myself,
then they're gonna respect me.

39:37.108 --> 39:40.746
You're right.

39:40.779 --> 39:43.682
Whatever you need, man.

39:43.715 --> 39:44.783
I got you.

39:54.560 --> 39:55.794
Hey...

40:05.070 --> 40:07.873
Dr. Morris, the asthmatic
in Exam Two dropped his sats.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.441
I think he needs a tube.

40:09.475 --> 40:11.543
Coming!

40:11.577 --> 40:12.911
(man panting)

40:12.944 --> 40:16.648
It's okay, sir.
The doctor's coming.

40:16.682 --> 40:19.184
Start continuous albuterol,
solumedrol 125.

40:19.217 --> 40:19.918
It's ready.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.720
Sats down to 89.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.722
.1 milligram epi I.V., then
infuse a milligram over an hour.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.457
(screaming)
You don't want
to tube him?

40:25.491 --> 40:26.558
Reg!

40:26.592 --> 40:28.627
It's okay! Reg!

40:28.660 --> 40:29.928
What's the matter, buddy?

40:29.961 --> 40:31.196
You e-mail me
from Baltimore.

40:31.229 --> 40:32.864
Let me know
how it goes,
alright?

40:32.898 --> 40:36.234
Yeah, I'm sure a lot
of needle sticks

40:36.267 --> 40:37.536
and a huge supply
of tests.

40:37.569 --> 40:38.904
You'll be fine.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.706
Fly safe.

40:40.739 --> 40:42.774
Yeah, I hope they let me on
the plane

40:42.808 --> 40:44.209
with a week's worth
of urine samples.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.777
(chuckles)

40:45.811 --> 40:47.045
Go on and pack,
sweetie.

40:47.078 --> 40:49.981
We leave early.

40:50.015 --> 40:53.652
Hey, thanks for today, Tony.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.086
I had a great time.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.155
My pleasure, buddy.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.834
I don't know
how to thank you.

41:08.867 --> 41:13.104
I haven't see him
that happy in so long.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.006
It was nothing.

41:15.040 --> 41:20.211
No, it was most definitely
something.

41:31.857 --> 41:35.827
I'll probably be up packing
all night.

41:35.861 --> 41:37.095
I better go home.

41:37.128 --> 41:38.830
I have an early
shift tomorrow.

41:41.967 --> 41:43.669
Will you keep me posted?

41:43.702 --> 41:46.204
Yeah, I will.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.206
Good night, Tony.

42:02.921 --> 42:04.590
(loud clattering)

42:09.360 --> 42:10.929
(beeps)

42:10.962 --> 42:12.798
Hi, Abby, this is Sally
in Dr. Murphy's office.

42:12.831 --> 42:14.099
Just a reminder that you have
an appointment

42:14.132 --> 42:17.168
with the hygienist Friday
at 9:00 a.m.

42:21.873 --> 42:22.874
(phone rings)

42:27.613 --> 42:30.949
Hello?

42:30.982 --> 42:33.118
No, no, yeah.

42:33.151 --> 42:35.854
No, I'm not interested.

42:35.887 --> 42:37.122
(hangs up)

43:17.663 --> 43:19.665
(wine pouring)
