WEBVTT

00:08.109 --> 00:10.141
THE BULLET RIPPED UP
MY INSIDES.

00:10.141 --> 00:13.144
THEY SAID THAT IT'S GONNA BE
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

00:13.144 --> 00:15.316
FOR ME TO GET PREGNANT.
YOU WILL BE SHOT THREE TIMES.

00:15.316 --> 00:19.450
YOU, AGENT BENFORD, YOU WILL
KILL AGENT NOH ON MARCH 15th

00:19.450 --> 00:22.693
WITH THE VERY GUN I ASSUME
YOU'RE CARRYING RIGHT NOW.

00:22.693 --> 00:24.255
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT I SAW.

00:24.255 --> 00:26.197
IT WASN'T OUR WEDDING.
IT WAS HIS FUNERAL.

00:26.197 --> 00:29.260
WE CAN DO MORE THAN WISH.
WE CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE.

00:29.260 --> 00:32.032
(Mark) MY THERAPIST GAVE ME
THIS DRUG TO UNLOCK THE PARTS

00:32.032 --> 00:34.034
OF MY FLASH-FORWARD
I COULDN'T REMEMBER.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.737
WE WERE TALKING
ON THE PHONE TOGETHER.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.170
NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO TELL ME EVERYTHING.
MOSAIC IS BIGGER THAN YOU.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.112
YOU'RE JUST
A-A TINY SPECK, MARK.

00:41.112 --> 00:44.275
AGENT VOGEL HAS OFFICIALLY
JOINED THE MOSAIC TASK FORCE.
(grunts)

00:44.275 --> 00:46.447
IF YOU WANT TO AVOID BEING
KILLED, YOU'RE GONNA NEED

00:46.447 --> 00:49.280
A BETTER PARTNER
THAN MARK BENFORD.
THE SECOND THAT JERICHO KNOWS

00:49.280 --> 00:51.722
THAT I'M STILL ALIVE, THEY'LL
FIND ME AND THEY'LL KILL ME.

00:51.722 --> 00:54.085
CORPORAL MIKE WILLINGHAM.
I WAS IN TRACY'S CONVOY

00:54.085 --> 00:56.287
WHEN IT WAS ATTACKED.
I CAN'T HAVE YOU
DRINKIN' HERE.

00:56.287 --> 00:59.190
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.
FINE. I'LL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:00.691 --> 01:02.693
(man over P.A.)
VISITATION RIGHTS WILL BE OVER

01:02.693 --> 01:04.395
IN FIVE MINUTES.

01:04.395 --> 01:07.268
HAVE YOU BEEN
GOING TO MEETINGS?
EVERY TUESDAY AND THURSDAY.

01:07.268 --> 01:09.270
AND YOU'VE BEEN STAYING
OUT OF TROUBLE?

01:09.270 --> 01:11.272
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FIGHTING?

01:11.272 --> 01:14.145
YOU KNOW ME, TRACY.
I KEEP MY HEAD DOWN.

01:14.145 --> 01:16.247
(buzzer sounds, clank)

01:16.247 --> 01:19.180
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN, DAD.
YOU'RE GONNA GET PAROLED.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.452
THEY JUST CAN'T SAY NO
THIS TIME.

01:21.452 --> 01:23.454
TRANSFER GUARD CALL
IS TO THE MAIN GATE.

01:23.454 --> 01:25.316
(indistinct conversations)

01:25.316 --> 01:27.818
I'M GONNA MAKE THIS
UP TO YOU, TRACE,

01:27.818 --> 01:30.391
IF IT'S THE LAST THING
I EVER DO.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.663
JUST PROMISE YOU'LL SMILE
AT THE HEARING.

01:32.663 --> 01:34.665
EAR TO EAR.

01:38.129 --> 01:41.532
(chuckles)

01:41.532 --> 01:44.505
(loud buzzer, clank)

01:44.505 --> 01:46.207
VISITING HOURS ARE OVER.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.178
OKAY, SWEETHEART.

01:50.211 --> 01:53.113
LOCKDOWN IN CELL "B" WILL BE
INITIATEDIN 30 MINUTES.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.217
YOUR GIRL GOES
TO GLOUCESTER HIGH, RIGHT?

01:56.217 --> 01:59.250
SHE'S CUTE.

01:59.250 --> 02:03.524
GIRLS THAT AGE...
THEY'RE IN FULL BLOOM.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.797
NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO WITH
THEIR NEW CURVES YET, THOUGH.

02:06.797 --> 02:10.161
AND YOUR DAUGHTER--

02:10.161 --> 02:12.233
SHE'S GOT THAT LOOK
IN HER EYE.

02:12.233 --> 02:14.235
(grunts)

02:14.235 --> 02:16.837
DON'T YOU EVER, EVER TALK
ABOUT MY--UHH!

02:16.837 --> 02:18.239
(grunting)

02:18.239 --> 02:20.541
GET OFF! GET HIM OFF.

02:20.541 --> 02:27.718
(grunting)

02:27.718 --> 02:31.422
(horn honks)

02:31.422 --> 02:34.425
(Middle Distance Runners'
"Brother John" playing)

02:41.161 --> 02:42.763
(indistinct conversations)

02:42.763 --> 02:44.265
I'M GOOD, THANKS.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.337
â™ªâ™ª

02:46.337 --> 02:48.339
TRACY.

02:48.339 --> 02:50.341
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:50.341 --> 02:53.244
YOU SAID I COULDN'T
DRINK AT HOME.

02:53.244 --> 02:55.246
â™ªâ™ª

02:55.246 --> 02:58.279
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS, BUT TRUST ME.

02:58.279 --> 03:01.252
I'VE BEEN SITTING EXACTLY WHERE
YOU'RE SITTING RIGHT NOW.

03:01.252 --> 03:03.314
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

03:03.314 --> 03:06.417
PLEASE JUST SPARE ME
THE A.A. TALK, DAD.

03:06.417 --> 03:08.919
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

03:08.919 --> 03:13.424
â™ªâ™ª

03:13.424 --> 03:15.926
AND WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO COME IN HERE--

03:15.926 --> 03:19.270
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS AS MUCH
OR AS LITTLE AS YOU WANT.

03:19.270 --> 03:20.971
BUT LET ME JUST
ASK YOU ONE QUESTION

03:20.971 --> 03:22.973
BEFORE YOU SHUT ME OUT AGAIN.

03:22.973 --> 03:25.676
(lowers voice) IF YOU'RE
SO SCARED THESE JERICHO GUYS

03:25.676 --> 03:27.207
ARE AFTER YOU,

03:27.207 --> 03:31.312
AND I FOUND YOU BY WALKING
INTO THE CLOSEST BAR--

03:31.312 --> 03:34.315
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THIS IS A SMART MOVE HERE?

03:36.447 --> 03:38.449
DO YOU?

03:43.724 --> 03:46.757
(horn honking in distance)

03:46.757 --> 03:50.301
MARK IS GOING TO SHOOT YOU?
HE IS NOT GOING TO SHOOT ME.

03:50.301 --> 03:52.833
YOU JUST SAID THAT WOMAN
IN HONG KONG SAW A REPORT--

03:52.833 --> 03:55.766
ARMED MEN GUARD THIS WOMAN WHILE
SHE EATS DINNER, ALL RIGHT?

03:55.766 --> 03:57.338
BABE, SHE'S SHADY.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.870
YET SHE STILL KNOWS
THE SERIAL NUMBER TO MARK'S GUN.

03:59.870 --> 04:02.242
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
HE'S GOING TO BE THE ONE

04:02.242 --> 04:04.875
THAT PULLS THE TRIGGER.
HE'S A PRIME SUSPECT.

04:04.875 --> 04:07.518
PLEASE, DON'T--DON'T--DON'T GET
ALL LAWYER-Y ON ME HERE.

04:07.518 --> 04:11.422
ALL RIGHT? MARK IS THE ONE WHO
WENT HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD.

04:11.422 --> 04:13.884
HE RISKED HIS LIFE, ALL TO
FIND OUT WHO MIGHT KILL ME.

04:13.884 --> 04:17.328
BABE...
(whispers) HE'S NOT THE GUY.

04:17.328 --> 04:19.490
(normal voice) ALL RIGHT?

04:23.564 --> 04:26.036
IT WAS YOUR MEMORIAL.

04:26.036 --> 04:29.900
I FIGURED IT OUT, DEM.

04:29.900 --> 04:32.272
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
ON THE BEACH...

04:32.272 --> 04:35.546
IT WASN'T OUR WEDDING
THAT I SAW.

04:35.546 --> 04:38.579
BABY, IT WAS YOUR MEMORIAL.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.051
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

04:41.051 --> 04:44.815
I FILED THE PAPERWORK
TO DESTROY THE GUN.

04:44.815 --> 04:47.518
IT'S ALREADY
IN THE EVIDENCE LOCKER.

04:47.518 --> 04:50.861
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.
EVERYTHING IS GONNA BE FINE.

04:50.861 --> 04:52.663
COME HERE.

04:52.663 --> 04:54.495
(inhales deeply, kisses)

04:54.495 --> 04:57.328
YOU GOTTA TRUST ME.

04:57.328 --> 04:59.570
OKAY?

04:59.570 --> 05:02.403
I'M GONNA MARRY YOU.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.676
NOT GETTING OUT OF IT.

05:05.676 --> 05:07.678
(Elvis Perkins)
â™ª WHOSE EYES ARE THOSE â™ª

05:07.678 --> 05:09.740
â™ª TOO FAIR TO BE â™ª

05:09.740 --> 05:12.543
â™ª BUT THE NIGHT
IN DAY'S CLOTHES? â™ª

05:12.543 --> 05:16.086
â™ª SPEAK, SPEAK IT, I BEG â™ª

05:16.086 --> 05:18.088
â™ª IF YOU KNOW IT â™ª

05:20.320 --> 05:24.054
â™ª JUST SAY IT PLAIN â™ª

05:24.054 --> 05:28.959
â™ª LORRAINE'S â™ª
(pills rattle)

05:32.332 --> 05:36.006
â™ª WHAT THING IS THIS â™ª

05:36.006 --> 05:38.669
â™ª AT MY FEET â™ª

05:38.669 --> 05:40.671
â™ª AT MY HEART? â™ª

05:40.671 --> 05:41.942
(doorbell rings)

05:41.942 --> 05:44.915
â™ª IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING â™ª

05:44.915 --> 05:47.117
ZOEY.

05:47.117 --> 05:49.119
WE NEED TO TALK.

05:49.119 --> 05:52.853
ALL RIGHT. COME ON IN.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.826
HYPOTHETICALLY, MARK.

05:55.826 --> 05:57.888
HYPOTHETICALLY.

05:57.888 --> 05:59.890
COME ON. EVEN I COULD
COME UP WITH A SCENARIO

05:59.890 --> 06:03.133
WHERE I'D WANT
TO KILL DEMETRI.
LOOK, NO MATTER
HOW CRAZY THINGS GET,

06:03.133 --> 06:07.468
I'D NEVER HURT DEMETRI.
BUT WHAT IF DEMETRI'S
GOT A GUN TO YOUR HEAD?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.540
HE'S ABOUT
TO PULL THE TRIGGER.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.872
TO SAVE YOUR OWN LIFE,
DO YOU SHOOT HIM?
COME ON.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.745
DO YOU KILL HIM, MARK?
I KNOW YOU LOVE DEMETRI,

06:14.745 --> 06:17.007
BUT I THINK YOU MAY WANT TO
REEL IT IN THERE, ZOEY.

06:17.007 --> 06:19.680
(sighs)
SO THE QUESTION BECOMES,

06:19.680 --> 06:22.853
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO WHERE
DEMETRI WOULD WANT YOU DEAD?

06:22.853 --> 06:25.686
DO YOU HAVE
SOME DEEP, DARK SECRET

06:25.686 --> 06:28.058
WORTH KILLING SOMEONE OVER?
NO.

06:28.058 --> 06:30.991
THEN WHAT AM I
MISSING HERE, MARK?
WELL, HERE'S A THEORY--

06:30.991 --> 06:33.494
SOMEONE AT THE BUREAU'S
BEEN LEAKING INFORMATION,

06:33.494 --> 06:36.597
PUTTING A LOT OF US IN DANGER.
NOW I DON'T THINK DEMETRI'S

06:36.597 --> 06:39.069
THE GUY, BUT IF HE WAS--
WELL...

06:39.069 --> 06:40.571
I'M SORRY.

06:40.571 --> 06:42.903
I THOUGHT WE WERE PLAYING
"OUTRAGEOUS ACCUSATIONS."

06:42.903 --> 06:45.976
GO TO HELL, MARK.

06:45.976 --> 06:48.008
(door opens, slams)

06:55.846 --> 06:58.849
(male announcer on TV)
SECOND DOWN AND 6 FOR IOWA...

06:58.849 --> 07:01.852
...FOR 69 YARDS
WILL BREAK THE HUDDLE.

07:01.852 --> 07:04.154
PATTERSON TO WORK OUT OF
THE SHOTGUN, SPREAD FORMATION

07:04.154 --> 07:06.156
TWO RECEIVERS TO HIS RIGHT.

07:06.156 --> 07:08.428
(knock on door)
TAKES THE SNAP, DROP BACK.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.601
(knock)
LOOKING, TRYING TO HOOK UP
WITH SAMUELS, NEAR SIDE...

07:10.601 --> 07:13.834
(door squeaks)
...BY A GOOD 5 YARDS
ON THAT ONE.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.936
ARE YOU MR. AARON STARK?

07:15.936 --> 07:18.108
THE COMMANDANT
OF THE MARINE CORPS

07:18.108 --> 07:20.941
HAS ENTRUSTED ME TO EXPRESS--

07:20.941 --> 07:25.145
I WAS A MARINE RECON.
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.478
WHEN AND HOW?

07:27.478 --> 07:30.881
MR. STARK--
WHEN AND HOW?

07:30.881 --> 07:34.024
(announcer continues
calling game indistinctly)

07:34.024 --> 07:35.526
TWO DAYS AGO,

07:35.526 --> 07:37.528
NEAR KUNAR PROVINCE.

07:37.528 --> 07:40.561
YOUR DAUGHTER'S UNIT
ENCOUNTERED THE ENEMY.

07:40.561 --> 07:44.565
A ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE
HIT HER HUMVEE.

07:44.565 --> 07:46.737
I KNOW THEY'RE GONNA
SEND A LETTER.

07:46.737 --> 07:48.739
(voice breaking) WE'RE DONE.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.217
(gasping)

08:11.021 --> 08:12.963
(whimpering)

08:12.963 --> 08:14.965
(sizzling)

08:14.965 --> 08:17.067
IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

08:17.067 --> 08:19.970
GRILLED PEANUT BUTTER
AND BANANA SANDWICHES.

08:19.970 --> 08:23.033
BEST THING IN THE WORLD
FOR A HANGOVER.

08:23.033 --> 08:25.776
I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU MADE IT
'CAUSE I LIKED IT.

08:25.776 --> 08:28.839
TWO BIRDS, ONE STONE.

08:28.839 --> 08:31.181
TRACY, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO ASK YOU.

08:31.181 --> 08:33.213
THE NAME JAMES ERSKINE
RING ANY BELLS?

08:33.213 --> 08:36.587
NO. SHOULD IT?
I HAD MARK DO SOME DIGGING.

08:36.587 --> 08:38.989
TURNS OUT
THIS JERICHO OUTFIT--

08:38.989 --> 08:41.151
THEY'VE GOT BRANCHES
ALL OVER THE WORLD,

08:41.151 --> 08:44.024
BUT THEY'RE HEADQUARTERED
OUT IN SANTA MONICA.

08:44.024 --> 08:47.057
ERSKINE'S HEAD OF OPERATIONS.

08:47.057 --> 08:51.101
MARK ALSO DID A BACKGROUND CHECK
ON YOUR C.O.

08:51.101 --> 08:54.064
MUSGROVE? IS HE DIRTY?

08:54.064 --> 08:56.066
LIEUTENANT PAUL MUSGROVE
WAS KILLED

08:56.066 --> 09:00.040
IN A HELICOPTER CRASH TWO DAYS
AFTER YOUR SUPPOSED "DEATH."

09:00.040 --> 09:03.073
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DON'T
THINK THAT'S A COINCIDENCE.
NO, I DON'T.

09:03.073 --> 09:06.577
AND I GOT A BUDDY
AT THE PENTAGON--
DAD, PLEASE.

09:06.577 --> 09:08.749
I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING,
BUT THIS IS--

09:08.749 --> 09:11.121
THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL.

09:11.121 --> 09:14.154
I SHOULD'VE NEVER LISTENED
TO KHAMIR.
WHAT'S HE GOT
TO DO WITH THIS?

09:14.154 --> 09:18.959
WHEN JERICHO STARTED
LOOKING FOR ME AGAIN

09:18.959 --> 09:21.962
AFTER THE BLACKOUT,
I KNEW THAT I HAD TO LEAVE,

09:21.962 --> 09:24.064
THAT IT WASN'T SAFE
FOR ANYONE TO BE AROUND ME.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.737
A HUMANITARIAN RELIEF PLANE
LANDED NEAR OUR VILLAGE.

09:26.737 --> 09:29.069
THEY WERE HEADED BACK
TO THE U.S., AND THEY HAD ROOM

09:29.069 --> 09:31.772
FOR ME ONBOARD, SO THEY
HID ME IN THEIR CARGO HOLD.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.144
KHAMIR SAID THAT IT WAS A SIGN--
IT'S ALL PART OF MY DESTINY

09:34.144 --> 09:36.146
THAT I WAS SUPPOSED
TO COME BACK HERE

09:36.146 --> 09:38.148
AND BRING YOU BACK
TO AFGHANISTAN.

09:38.148 --> 09:41.281
WHAT AN IDIOT I'VE BEEN.
AREN'T YOU BEING A LITTLE HARD
ON YOURSELF HERE?

09:41.281 --> 09:45.185
NO. ONCE I GOT BACK HERE,
AND I ACTUALLY SAW YOU,

09:45.185 --> 09:47.587
THE THOUGHT OF BRINGING YOU
BACK TO THAT HELLHOLE,

09:47.587 --> 09:49.660
TO A PLACE WHERE
YOU COULD GET KILLED--

09:49.660 --> 09:51.662
I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF

09:51.662 --> 09:53.724
IF ANYTHING BAD HAPPENED
TO YOU, DAD.

09:53.724 --> 09:56.797
DON'T WORRY, SWEETHEART.
I'M GONNA BE OKAY,

09:56.797 --> 09:58.298
AND SO ARE YOU.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.030
TRUST ME.

10:05.075 --> 10:07.177
TRUST ME.

10:08.939 --> 10:11.381
(Lloyd)
SO DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN

10:11.381 --> 10:13.383
WHY YOU BROUGHT ME
IN HERE AGAIN?

10:13.383 --> 10:15.385
APRIL 29th.

10:15.385 --> 10:17.317
WE WERE
ON THE PHONE TOGETHER.

10:19.389 --> 10:21.391
REMEMBER?

10:21.391 --> 10:24.094
A LOT OF THINGS
CAME UP ON THAT CALL--

10:24.094 --> 10:27.928
THE NAME D. GIBBONS,
SOME INITIALS--Q.E.D.,

10:27.928 --> 10:31.301
OH, AND THE FACT THAT THERE'S
GONNA BE ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

10:31.301 --> 10:34.965
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT ANY OF THAT?

10:34.965 --> 10:37.908
NO?

10:37.908 --> 10:40.010
WE HAVE A SKETCH.

10:40.010 --> 10:42.673
WE DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS.

10:42.673 --> 10:44.675
BUT AROUND THE TIME
OF THE BLACKOUT,

10:44.675 --> 10:47.077
HE WAS HAPPILY
CLONING CREDIT CARDS.

10:47.077 --> 10:52.052
HE ASSUMED THE IDENTITY
OF SOMEONE NAMED D. GIBBONS.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.157
BASED ON OUR CALL,
YOU SEEM TO KNOW HIM.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.159
I DON'T.

11:01.031 --> 11:02.693
NO?

11:02.693 --> 11:04.895
NO, I DON'T.

11:04.895 --> 11:07.037
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:07.037 --> 11:11.071
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME
TO PLAY PISSY BRIT WITH YOU.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.203
LET'S TAKE A WALK.

11:13.203 --> 11:15.145
(door opens)

11:15.145 --> 11:17.808
HEY.
HEY.

11:17.808 --> 11:19.279
LUNCH?

11:19.279 --> 11:22.382
I WAS IN THE AREA. I THOUGHT I'D
BRING YOU A LITTLE SOMETHING.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.756
OH, THANKS, HONEY.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
WELL, SHE DID,
AND SUCH A GENEROUS PORTION.

11:25.756 --> 11:28.719
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA
FINISH THAT WHOLE THING.
DON'T WORRY, STAN.

11:28.719 --> 11:31.091
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING
EVEN MORE DELICIOUS.
HMM?

11:31.091 --> 11:33.223
I FILED A FREEDOM
OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST

11:33.223 --> 11:37.367
ON EVERYTHING THIS OFFICE HAS
ON THE MOSAIC INVESTIGATION.
YOU DID WHAT?

11:37.367 --> 11:40.971
IF THERE'S EVEN ONE WORD IN
THERE THAT WILL KEEP YOU SAFE,

11:40.971 --> 11:43.703
I HAVE TO--
THIS IS MY OFFICE, OKAY?

11:43.703 --> 11:46.036
YOU DON'T JUST COME IN HERE
AND SERVE MY BOSS PAPERS.

11:46.036 --> 11:48.138
(lowers voice)
I'M NOT GONNA STOP

11:48.138 --> 11:51.041
UNTIL WE'RE
ON THAT BEACH TOGETHER.
(Demetri)
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS--

11:51.041 --> 11:54.314
SOMEBODY BETTER START MAKING
SOME SENSE REAL SOON.
IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE, ACTUALLY.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.988
I'M GOING TO BE REVIEWING ALL
OF YOUR MOSAIC-RELATED FILES.
I'M SORRY, STAN. SHE'S GOING
TO BE LEAVING RIGHT NOW--

11:57.988 --> 11:59.990
IS THIS ABOUT MARK'S GUN?

11:59.990 --> 12:03.193
PLEASE TELL ME THAT'S
NOT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.
MOSAIC'S THE SUBJECT

12:03.193 --> 12:05.956
OF WIDESPREAD
NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION,

12:05.956 --> 12:08.198
WHICH IS PRECISELY THE TYPE
OF ISSUE WHICH QUALIFIES

12:08.198 --> 12:11.101
FOR EXPEDITED PROCESSING
UNDER F.O.I.A.

12:11.101 --> 12:13.103
TELL SOMEBODY WHO CARES.

12:13.103 --> 12:15.405
CAN I RECOMMEND
YOU START WITH A JUDGE?

12:15.405 --> 12:17.768
'CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

12:17.768 --> 12:21.141
I'M OPENING UP
CLASSIFIED FILES TO YOU.
YEP, WE COULD DO IT THAT WAY,
STAN, NO PROBLEM.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.173
BUT GOING INTO COURT--
IT'S PUBLIC,

12:23.173 --> 12:25.175
AND I'M GUESSING
THAT "PUBLIC"

12:25.175 --> 12:27.477
IS NOT GOING TO HELP
YOUR INVESTIGATION MUCH.

12:31.782 --> 12:36.456
AGENT NOH WILL MAKE THE FILES
AVAILABLE FOR YOU TO REVIEW.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.489
THANK YOU.

12:52.442 --> 12:57.247
(ship horn blows)

12:57.247 --> 12:59.249
(honks horn twice)

12:59.249 --> 13:02.052
(men speaking indistinctly)

13:02.052 --> 13:04.054
MIKE! HOW'S EVERYTHING?

13:04.054 --> 13:07.257
CAN'T COMPLAIN. LIKE MY DAD
SAYS, IF ALL MY PROBLEMS

13:07.257 --> 13:09.789
COULD BE SOLVED WITH MONEY,
I'M DOING GOOD, RIGHT?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.791
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

13:11.791 --> 13:14.064
(exhales deeply) COULDN'T BE
BETTER. COULD NOT BE BETTER.

13:14.064 --> 13:17.968
THAT'S SO GREAT TO HEAR.
I THINK I KNOW WHY.

13:17.968 --> 13:20.330
I GOT A CALL LAST WEEK.
IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY.

13:20.330 --> 13:22.032
BLOCKED NUMBER.

13:22.032 --> 13:25.105
PERSON ON THE OTHER END OF
THE LINE DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING,

13:25.105 --> 13:26.406
BUT THEY DON'T HANG UP,
EITHER.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.509
WE JUST SIT ON THE PHONE
IN SILENCE.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.511
SUDDENLY, IT HITS ME...

13:33.543 --> 13:35.545
(whispers) IT'S TRACY.

13:35.545 --> 13:38.048
(normal voice)
SHE'S ALIVE, ISN'T SHE?

13:46.126 --> 13:48.498
SHE'S AT MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

13:48.498 --> 13:50.931
(laughs)

13:50.931 --> 13:53.103
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
IT'S COME TRUE.

13:53.103 --> 13:55.165
IT'S COME TRUE.

13:55.165 --> 13:56.436
(sniffles)

14:02.042 --> 14:03.143
(door creaks)

14:03.143 --> 14:05.145
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

14:05.145 --> 14:07.847
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE ME
THROUGH EVERYTHING YOU SAW...

14:07.847 --> 14:10.250
YOU'VE GOT TO BE JOKING.
AND WHERE YOU SAW IT.

14:10.250 --> 14:13.453
WE WERE ON THE PHONE TOGETHER.
YOU HEARD EVERYTHING I SAID.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.926
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU SAID IT

14:15.926 --> 14:19.459
OR WHAT YOU SAW DURING THE REST
OF YOUR VISION, FOR THAT MATTER.

14:19.459 --> 14:22.462
SO IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME STOP
ANOTHER BLACKOUT FROM HAPPENING,

14:22.462 --> 14:25.465
OR EVEN IF YOU DON'T, YOU'RE
STILL GONNA WALK ME THROUGH IT.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.267
YOU GOT THAT?

14:29.169 --> 14:31.341
SO LET'S MOVE IT.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.346
(exhales deeply)

14:36.346 --> 14:40.110
THIS DOESN'T BOTHER YOU?

14:40.110 --> 14:42.382
START AT THE BEGINNING.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.915
I GOT A TEXT MESSAGE.

14:44.915 --> 14:47.217
(whoosh)
I WAS GETTING UP
FROM THE BED.

14:47.217 --> 14:50.060
I WAS--I'M SORRY, ARE THESE
DETAILS REALLY NECESSARY?

14:50.060 --> 14:53.893
DO YOU THINK
I WANT TO HEAR 'EM?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.426
(whoosh)
I NOTICED THAT I HAD
A TEXT MESSAGE ON MY PHONE.

14:56.426 --> 15:01.001
IT WAS FROM SIMON. IT WAS
A FORMULA, OR PART OF A FORMULA.

15:01.001 --> 15:05.275
I'M NOT SURE. I HAD IT WRITTEN
OUT HERE ON THE--ON THE MIRROR.

15:05.275 --> 15:07.437
(whoosh)

15:07.437 --> 15:10.941
SORRY,
I HAVE TO MAKE A CALL.
(whoosh)

15:10.941 --> 15:12.612
THE MIRROR?

15:12.612 --> 15:14.614
UH, YEAH. I USED LIPSTICK.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.587
LOOK, I HAD A SENSE THERE
WAS A WOMAN IN THE ROOM,

15:17.587 --> 15:21.251
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD,
I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS OLIVIA.

15:21.251 --> 15:23.223
THE NEXT THING I DID
WAS DIAL A NUMBER.

15:23.223 --> 15:26.226
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS YOURS.
YOU SAID IT WASN'T A GOOD TIME.

15:26.226 --> 15:30.000
I ASKED IF YOU'D BEEN DRINKING.
YOU DIDN'T TAKE THAT VERY WELL.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.162
(Mark) Go to hell, Lloyd.
WE NEED TO TALK.

15:32.162 --> 15:34.234
ABOUT WHAT?
THE Q.E.D.

15:34.234 --> 15:37.237
ON THE PHONE CALL,
YOU SAID YOU WERE CLOSE

15:37.237 --> 15:40.270
TO CRACKING THE Q.E.D.
YEAH, IT'S LATIN. IT MEANS--

15:40.270 --> 15:42.142
QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUM.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.614
"THAT WHICH WAS
TO BE DEMONSTRATED."

15:44.614 --> 15:46.616
COULD BE,
BUT COULD BE Q.E.D.--

15:46.616 --> 15:48.578
QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS.

15:48.578 --> 15:50.250
ACTUALLY, WAIT, NO.
NO?

15:50.250 --> 15:52.252
WELL, I SAID "THE Q.E.D."

15:52.252 --> 15:54.324
YOU WOULDN'T PUT
A DEFINITE ARTICLE IN FRONT

15:54.324 --> 15:56.987
OF THE LATIN MEANING
OR THE DISCIPLINE.

15:56.987 --> 16:00.190
BUT, WELL, YOU WOULD PUT IT
IN FRONT OF A FORMULA.
THE ONE ON THE MIRROR?

16:00.190 --> 16:02.432
ABSOLUTELY.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.069
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING,
MISS HAWK.

16:09.069 --> 16:14.074
UM, IS THERE ANYTHING IN HERE
ABOUT PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORIES?

16:14.074 --> 16:16.046
WE NEED TO DISCUSS
A COUPLE OF THINGS

16:16.046 --> 16:18.178
BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER.

16:18.178 --> 16:21.151
I HAVE A LETTER HERE
FROM YOUR OBSTETRICIAN.

16:21.151 --> 16:23.453
THE INJURY THAT YOU SUSTAINED
WHEN YOU WERE SHOT

16:23.453 --> 16:26.156
MAKES PREGNANCY
UNLIKELY FOR YOU.

16:26.156 --> 16:28.558
YOUR O.B. THINKS
IT'S TOO SOON TO PURSUE THIS,

16:28.558 --> 16:31.061
AND FRANKLY, I AGREE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU AGREE?

16:31.061 --> 16:33.993
I THINK WE HAVE A BETTER CHANCE
OF SUCCEEDING IF WE WAIT.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.995
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

16:35.995 --> 16:37.697
OKAY.

16:37.697 --> 16:42.632
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I SAW THAT I WAS PREGNANT.

16:42.632 --> 16:45.035
(whoosh)
I WAS INTO
MY SECOND TRIMESTER,

16:45.035 --> 16:46.576
WHICH MEANS...
(whoosh)

16:46.576 --> 16:49.739
I HAVE TO GET PREGNANT NOW.
I'M WORRIED
YOU'RE NOT THINKING

16:49.739 --> 16:52.642
THIS WHOLE THING THROUGH.
WELL, YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT THAT,

16:52.642 --> 16:54.644
BECAUSE I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT THIS.

16:54.644 --> 16:57.287
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE
RISKS INVOLVED,

16:57.287 --> 17:00.350
BUT NO AMOUNT OF RESEARCH
OR STATISTICS

17:00.350 --> 17:02.752
IS GONNA CHANGE THE FACT
THAT I WANT THAT BABY--

17:02.752 --> 17:06.156
NOT A DIFFERENT BABY
TWO YEARS FROM NOW

17:06.156 --> 17:09.199
WHEN I'M MORE SURE
ABOUT MY LIFE OR WHATEVER.

17:09.199 --> 17:11.201
I WANT THIS SPECIFIC CHILD.

17:13.603 --> 17:16.236
THIS IS MY BABY.

17:23.073 --> 17:24.114
(slam)

17:24.114 --> 17:26.116
THANK YOU.

17:26.116 --> 17:28.278
(telephone ringing)

17:28.278 --> 17:30.280
I TOLD YOU TO DROP THIS.

17:30.280 --> 17:33.253
NO, YOU TOLD ME TO TRUST YOU,
AND I DO.
THEN DROP IT.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.256
I'VE ALREADY FOUND SOMETHING
IN ALDA HERTZOG'S DEPOSITION

17:36.256 --> 17:38.228
THAT MAY HELP US.
DROP IT.

17:38.228 --> 17:41.461
(exhales deeply)
WHAT IF IT WERE ME?

17:41.461 --> 17:43.793
WHAT IF I
DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING?

17:43.793 --> 17:46.266
WOULD YOU LISTEN
IF I TOLD YOU TO STOP?

17:48.138 --> 17:50.140
FINE.

17:50.140 --> 17:53.373
YOU WANT TO DIG,
YOU KEEP DIGGING.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.375
BUT SERVING MY BOSS
WITH PAPERS,

17:55.375 --> 17:57.447
TRYING TO SMEAR MY PARTNER--

17:57.447 --> 17:59.709
THAT IS WAY THE HELL
OVER THE LINE.

17:59.709 --> 18:02.612
I'M GOING TO DO WHATEVER
I CAN TO PREVENT YOUR MURDER.

18:04.514 --> 18:09.159
(man)
â™ª YOU'LL KNOW WHEN IT'S OVER â™ª

18:09.159 --> 18:10.390
(whoosh)

18:10.390 --> 18:15.125
â™ª YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE AROUND â™ª

18:17.797 --> 18:21.601
â™ª WHEN THE TIME COMES,
YOU'LL COME BACK HERE â™ª

18:21.601 --> 18:24.174
(grunts)

18:52.902 --> 18:54.834
(door closes)

19:02.472 --> 19:06.276
(bugle playing "Taps")
(man) PRESENT ARMS!

19:06.276 --> 19:10.350
(rifles cocking)
READY. AIM. FIRE!

19:10.350 --> 19:12.382
(rifles fire)
FIRE!

19:12.382 --> 19:15.455
(rifles cock, firing)
FIRE!

19:21.431 --> 19:23.693
(shattering, crashing)

19:35.775 --> 19:38.778
(crying)

19:45.855 --> 19:47.857
SWEETHEART, I'M HOME.

19:47.857 --> 19:51.190
SOMETHIN' BURNING?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.792
(smoke detector alarm blaring)
TRACE?

19:52.792 --> 19:54.264
WHAT?

19:57.397 --> 19:59.399
TRACE?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.972
(scoffs) TRACY?

20:02.972 --> 20:04.634
TRACY, WHERE ARE YOU?

20:26.926 --> 20:28.928
SHE'S ALIVE, ISN'T SHE?

20:34.564 --> 20:37.267
AS WE SPOKE,
I WALKED DOWN THE STAIRS.

20:37.267 --> 20:39.269
BY THEN I WAS, UH,
STANDING HERE.

20:39.269 --> 20:41.240
I-I HEARD
A LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.773
I PRESUME
THAT WAS YOUR DAUGHTER.

20:43.773 --> 20:45.675
GO AHEAD.
IT'S YOUR HOUSE, TOO.

20:45.675 --> 20:50.380
SHE WENT INTO THE KITCHEN
WITH DYLAN.
YOU STARTED EXPLAINING
SOMETHING.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.882
WELL, IT'S ONLY THEORETICAL,
BUT I'M CLOSE TO CRACKING IT.

20:52.882 --> 20:56.626
YOU NEED TO HURRY. THERE'S
GONNA BE ANOTHER BLACKOUT.

20:56.626 --> 21:00.330
I HUNG UP.
I SAT DOWN ON THE COUCH.

21:00.330 --> 21:02.292
THE LAST THING I REMEMBER
WAS THAT I HEARD A VOICE...
HEY, HONEY.

21:02.292 --> 21:04.033
BEFORE I COULD SEE
WHO IT WAS,

21:04.033 --> 21:06.966
I WOKE UP ON THE FLOOR
AT N.L.A.P.
WAIT. YOU SKIPPED SOMETHING.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.639
WHY WERE YOU SO ADAMANT
WHEN YOU STARTED TALKING

21:09.639 --> 21:12.502
ABOUT D. GIBBONS?
THE MAN YOU CALL
D. GIBBONS LIED TO YOU.

21:12.502 --> 21:15.875
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW HIM.
I DIDN'T ASK IF YOU KNEW HIM.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.848
I ASKED,
WHY WERE YOU SO ADAMANT?

21:18.848 --> 21:20.880
I DON'T KNOW.

21:22.812 --> 21:25.515
YOU KNOW THIS MAN--
NOT IN THE FUTURE.

21:25.515 --> 21:28.318
RIGHT NOW.
WELL, I DON'T.

21:28.318 --> 21:31.491
I WAS ANGRY BECAUSE I WAS
ON THE PHONE WITH SOME DRUNK.
YOU CALLED ME.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.493
I WAS IMPORTANT
TO WHAT WAS GOING ON.

21:33.493 --> 21:36.396
YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME
EVERYTHING.
I DON'T KNOW ANY D. GIBBONS.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.298
YOU SAID D. GIBBONS
WAS A LIAR.
HE IS A LIAR!

21:44.033 --> 21:46.976
SO YOU DO KNOW HIM.

21:49.008 --> 21:52.081
(vehicle approaches)

21:52.081 --> 21:53.643
(horn honks)

21:53.643 --> 21:56.546
HEY, MIKE. I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO REACH YOU. WHAT'S UP?

21:56.546 --> 21:58.588
I TALKED TO JACK.
HE SAID YOU WERE MOVIN'?

21:58.588 --> 22:01.351
YES, SIR. MY OLD MAN GOT ME
A JOB CLOSER TO HOME.

22:01.351 --> 22:03.453
CAN'T SAY NO TO FAMILY,
RIGHT?

22:03.453 --> 22:05.455
GOOD ON YOU.
(trunk door whooshes)

22:05.455 --> 22:07.927
NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FAMILY.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.929
I'M GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.

22:09.929 --> 22:13.633
WHAT DO YOU SAY? LET ME BUY YOU
A BURGER BEFORE YOU TAKE OFF.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.865
COME ON. COME ON.
ALL RIGHT, A QUICK BITE.

22:17.707 --> 22:20.940
(rock music playing)
DID YOU KNOW I WENT
TO PRISON?

22:20.940 --> 22:23.873
YOU SERIOUS?

22:23.873 --> 22:27.076
TWO AND A HALF YEARS.

22:27.076 --> 22:28.978
GOT INTO A BAR FIGHT,

22:28.978 --> 22:30.980
HIT A GUY A LITTLE TOO HARD.

22:30.980 --> 22:33.683
DAMN.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, AARON.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.627
WHERE IS THIS PLACE?

22:37.627 --> 22:40.460
TELL YOU ONE THING--
PRISON, ESPECIALLY WHERE I WAS,

22:40.460 --> 22:44.093
IT CHANGES YOU--
MAKES YOU A CAPABLE MAN.

22:44.093 --> 22:45.995
CAPABLE OF WHAT?

22:45.995 --> 22:47.997
ANYTHING. EVERYTHING.

22:47.997 --> 22:50.099
YOU FEEL LIKE AN ANIMAL.

22:50.099 --> 22:53.102
GUESS YOU DO
WHAT YOU GOTTA DO, RIGHT?

22:53.102 --> 22:56.546
EXACTLY. THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
BUT THE TRICK, MIKE,

22:56.546 --> 22:58.978
IS LEAVING THAT ANIMAL INSIDE
ONCE THEY LET YOU OUT.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.980
THAT ANIMAL'S GOT
NO PLACE IN THE WORLD.

23:00.980 --> 23:04.113
I'VE WORKED REAL HARD
TO KEEP HIM LOCKED UP.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.557
(tires screech)

23:07.557 --> 23:09.459
(shifts gears, turns engine off)

23:09.459 --> 23:10.920
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:10.920 --> 23:13.092
TODAY I'M GONNA LET HIM OUT.

23:13.092 --> 23:17.767
â™ªâ™ª

23:17.767 --> 23:19.829
(Ram Jam) â™ª WHOA,
BLACK BETTY, BAM-A-LAM â™ª

23:19.829 --> 23:22.131
â™ª WHOA, BLACK BETTY,
BAM-A-LAM â™ª

23:22.131 --> 23:24.103
â™ª BLACK BETTY HAD A CHILD,
BAM-A-LAM â™ª

23:24.103 --> 23:26.636
WHERE IS SHE, MIKE?
(screams)

23:26.636 --> 23:31.040
(both grunting)

23:31.040 --> 23:32.982
â™ª SAID OH, BLACK BETTY,
BAM-A-LAM â™ª

23:32.982 --> 23:35.985
WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER?
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

23:35.985 --> 23:38.117
AAH!

23:38.117 --> 23:40.490
(grunts)

23:40.490 --> 23:41.691
AAH!

23:41.691 --> 23:43.953
I KNOW YOU TIPPED OFF JERICHO!
AAH!

23:43.953 --> 23:47.056
WHERE'D THEY TAKE HER, MIKE?
DUDE, I DON'T--AAH!

23:47.056 --> 23:49.959
WHERE'D THEY TAKE HER, MIKE?
(grunts)

23:49.959 --> 23:52.862
YOU BREAK AN ARM LIKE THIS,
IT NEVER HEALS RIGHT.
YOU'RE GONNA
GET US BOTH KILLED!

23:52.862 --> 23:54.063
YOU FIRST!
(screams)

24:02.211 --> 24:05.014
EVERYTHING'S OUT OF CONTROL
AT WORK.

24:05.014 --> 24:08.117
YOU KNOW,
WEDECK'S NOT TALKING TO ME.
WHY NOT?

24:08.117 --> 24:10.119
ZOEY...

24:10.119 --> 24:12.752
AMBUSHED HIM
WITH F.O.I.A. PAPERS.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.785
SHE THINKS ALDA HAS SOME
INFORMATION ABOUT MY MURDER.

24:15.785 --> 24:17.787
THAT'S CRAZY.

24:17.787 --> 24:21.060
IT'S LIKE SHE'S ACTING LIKE
SHE LOVES YOU OR SOMETHING.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.062
ALL RIGHT, JANIS.

24:23.062 --> 24:25.795
WHERE WERE YOU TODAY,
BY THE WAY?

24:27.867 --> 24:32.201
(sighs)
I WAS AT A FERTILITY CLINIC.

24:32.201 --> 24:35.044
(chuckles) OKAY.

24:35.044 --> 24:36.906
MM-HMM.

24:36.906 --> 24:38.848
(chuckles) WOW.
YEAH, I KNOW.

24:38.848 --> 24:42.712
I PRACTICALLY HAD TO BEG THEM
TO TAKE ME ON AS A CLIENT.

24:42.712 --> 24:44.914
DID THEY?

24:44.914 --> 24:46.115
YEAH.

24:46.115 --> 24:47.256
ALL RIGHT.

24:47.256 --> 24:49.188
I PUSHED PRETTY HARD.

24:49.188 --> 24:52.221
BUT I HAVE TO CONCEIVE
THIS BABY NEXT WEEK

24:52.221 --> 24:54.023
TO MATCH WHAT I SAW.

24:54.023 --> 24:56.696
NEXT WEEK?

24:56.696 --> 25:00.570
OH, WELL, THAT'S...
THAT'S GREAT.

25:00.570 --> 25:03.132
THAT'S GREAT.

25:03.132 --> 25:06.876
AREN'T YOU, UH,

25:06.876 --> 25:08.978
AREN'T YOU SCARED, THOUGH--

25:08.978 --> 25:10.279
THE WHOLE MOM THING--

25:10.279 --> 25:12.982
I MEAN, WITH OUR LINE
OF WORK AND ALL?

25:12.982 --> 25:15.284
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT THAT'S KIND OF MY POINT.

25:15.284 --> 25:19.849
I DON'T WANT MY LIFE TO JUST
BE ABOUT BEING AN FBI AGENT.

25:19.849 --> 25:24.794
AND IF I WANT THAT LIFE, I HAVE
TO START LIVING IT RIGHT NOW.

25:24.794 --> 25:27.056
WHEN I GOT SHOT
AND I WAS LYING THERE

25:27.056 --> 25:29.629
LISTENING FOR THE AMBULANCE,

25:29.629 --> 25:33.603
THE ONLY THING I COULD
THINK ABOUT WAS THAT BABY

25:33.603 --> 25:36.806
AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT
I WOULDN'T GET TO HAVE HER,

25:36.806 --> 25:41.611
THAT I WOULD MISS
DRESSING HER IN PINK...

25:41.611 --> 25:43.973
THAT I WOULD NEVER
GET TO BRUSH HER HAIR.

25:47.116 --> 25:49.679
BROKE MY HEART.

25:49.679 --> 25:52.852
JANIS, DON'T GET ME
WRONG HERE, BUT...

25:52.852 --> 25:54.954
SHE DOESN'T EXIST YET.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.986
YES, SHE DOES.

25:56.986 --> 25:59.989
I KNOW SHE DOES.

25:59.989 --> 26:02.762
SHE'S OUT THERE

26:02.762 --> 26:05.234
MAKING HER WAY TOWARD ME.

26:05.234 --> 26:08.868
I'VE SPENT ALMOST
EVERY WAKING MOMENT

26:08.868 --> 26:11.871
THINKING ABOUT
WHO SHE'S GONNA BE.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.103
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HER.

26:14.103 --> 26:16.105
YOU'RE GONNA BE
AN AWESOME MOM.

26:16.105 --> 26:18.577
THANKS, DEM.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.250
WE BOTH HAVE TO FIGHT
FOR THE FUTURES WE WANT.

26:21.250 --> 26:24.353
GET RID OF THAT GUN.

26:27.256 --> 26:31.120
THE MAN YOU CALL D. GIBBONS--
HIS REAL NAME IS DYSON FROST.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.022
DYSON FROST?
MM-HMM.

26:33.022 --> 26:35.224
HOW'D YOU KNOW HIM?
I HEARD HIM GIVE A LECTURE

26:35.224 --> 26:37.697
ON THE WAVE STRUCTURE
OF MATTER ONCE.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.699
HE WAS ON SABBATICAL
AT OXFORD.

26:39.699 --> 26:42.732
I WAS DOING RESEARCH
ON WAVE MECHANICS,

26:42.732 --> 26:45.735
AND I HAD TO SIT THERE
AND LISTEN TO HIM TAKE CREDIT...

26:45.735 --> 26:48.738
(coffee pours, mug clatters)
FOR WORK I'D DONE
BUT HADN'T PUBLISHED YET.

26:48.738 --> 26:52.041
I MEAN, IT WAS INDISPUTABLY
MINE, BUT I HAD NO WAY OF

26:52.041 --> 26:55.044
PROVING HE'D GOT HIS HANDS
ON IT. BASTARD.
SO D. GIBBONS IS A LIAR.

26:55.044 --> 26:57.046
SOME TIME AFTER
I READ HIS OBITUARY,

26:57.046 --> 26:59.118
I REMEMBER THINKING,
"GOOD RIDDANCE."

26:59.118 --> 27:01.721
BUT OBVIOUSLY,
HE'S STILL ALIVE.

27:01.721 --> 27:04.353
AND AT SOME POINT ASSUMED
THE IDENTITY OF "D. GIBBONS."

27:04.353 --> 27:06.896
CHARLIE SAID,
"D. GIBBONS IS A BAD MAN."

27:06.896 --> 27:09.258
I THOUGHT MAYBE...

27:09.258 --> 27:11.961
YOU SAID IT TO HER...

27:11.961 --> 27:13.632
IN YOUR VISION.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.634
NO, I DIDN'T.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.037
YOU HAVEN'T ASKED HER
ABOUT IT?

27:18.037 --> 27:20.039
I'VE TRIED.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.771
SHE'S SHUT DOWN.

27:21.771 --> 27:25.314
WELL, IT SEEMS I'M NOT THE ONLY
PERSON YOU NEED TO TALK TO.

27:32.421 --> 27:35.084
THESE MEN WHO KIDNAPPED YOU--
DID THEY TELL YOU

27:35.084 --> 27:38.828
WHY THEY TOOK YOU,
WHAT THEY WANTED?

27:38.828 --> 27:40.229
WAS IT REVENGE?

27:40.229 --> 27:44.393
OKAY, SO THEY TORTURE YOU
FOR 48 HOURS,

27:44.393 --> 27:47.666
CUT OFF YOUR FRIEND'S FINGER--
YET THEY NEVER TOLD YOU WHY,

27:47.666 --> 27:50.339
MADE ANY DEMANDS,
THREATENED YOU IN ANY WAY?

27:50.339 --> 27:53.342
THEY DIDN'T THREATEN ME.

27:55.404 --> 27:58.207
THEY THREATENED DYLAN.

27:58.207 --> 28:03.112
LYING TO ME WON'T KEEP HIM SAFE.
TALKING TO ME WILL.

28:03.112 --> 28:05.855
I GAVE THEM EVERYTHING...

28:05.855 --> 28:08.718
ENERGY LEVELS,
EQUIPMENT SETTINGS,

28:08.718 --> 28:10.359
MONITORING PARAMETERS.

28:10.359 --> 28:13.723
COULD THEY USE ANY OF IT
TO CAUSE ANOTHER BLACKOUT?

28:13.723 --> 28:15.725
THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF,

28:15.725 --> 28:18.467
ESPECIALLY AFTER WHAT I SAID
TO YOU IN MY VISION.

28:18.467 --> 28:20.099
(mug clatters)

28:23.132 --> 28:25.134
THIS GUY...

28:25.134 --> 28:27.136
DYSON FROST...

28:27.136 --> 28:29.078
HE'S THE KEY.

28:29.078 --> 28:33.412
WE FIND HIM, MAYBE WE CAN STOP
THIS THING FROM HAPPENING AGAIN.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.919
I NEED YOUR HELP, LLOYD.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.096
I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN.

28:49.198 --> 28:52.461
(Mark) I GOT SOME INTERESTING
INFORMATION FROM LLOYD

28:52.461 --> 28:55.204
ABOUT DYSON FROST,
ALSO KNOWN AS D. GIBBONS.

28:55.204 --> 28:58.768
ACCORDING TO SIMCOE, DYSON FROST
WROTE THIS SEMINAL PAPER

28:58.768 --> 29:02.741
ABOUT SOMETHING CALLED
"THE MIRROR TEST."
WHAT THE HELL
IS A MIRROR TEST?

29:02.741 --> 29:05.314
IT'S A TEST THAT DETERMINES
RECOGNITION OF CONSCIOUSNESS

29:05.314 --> 29:08.277
AMONG SPECIES--
HUMANS, ELEPHANTS, CROWS.

29:08.277 --> 29:12.051
CROWS... SOMALIA?

29:12.051 --> 29:15.054
EVERYTHING POINTS TO IT, STAN.
THE CROW DIE OFF IN SOMALIA.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.857
WE FOUND TOWERS
IN THE SATELLITE PHOTOS.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.128
WE NEED TO BE THERE.

29:19.128 --> 29:21.260
I SPOKE TO A TEAM LEADER
AT RED PANDA.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.392
THEY FLY IN AND OUT
ALL THE TIME SAFELY.

29:23.392 --> 29:26.195
BIRD-WATCHING IN SOMALIA?

29:26.195 --> 29:29.138
HOW AM I GONNA
SELL THAT TO WASHINGTON?

29:29.138 --> 29:31.470
(Vogel) YOU DON'T.

29:33.542 --> 29:36.105
IT'S ALWAYS BETTER
TO BEG FOR FORGIVENESS

29:36.105 --> 29:38.377
THAN ASK FOR PERMISSION.

29:40.779 --> 29:44.053
HMM.

29:44.053 --> 29:46.055
(telephone rings)

29:46.055 --> 29:50.319
(Mark) This is Mark. Leave it
here. I'll get back to you.
(beep)

29:50.319 --> 29:53.993
(Aaron) Mark, it's me. Some
serious stuff has gone down,

29:53.993 --> 29:55.995
and I need you to run
a background check

29:55.995 --> 29:58.127
on that guy James Erskine,
the head of Jericho.

29:58.127 --> 30:00.269
Get back to me
as soon as you can.

30:00.269 --> 30:04.133
Thanks, buddy. Appreciate it.
(woman) JAMES,
IS SHE READY FOR THE CAKE?

30:04.133 --> 30:06.135
WE'RE ALL SET.

30:06.135 --> 30:08.137
(electricity crackles,
powers down)

30:08.137 --> 30:11.841
WHAT THE HELL?

30:11.841 --> 30:14.313
(electricity humming)

30:14.313 --> 30:16.585
(clank)

30:19.818 --> 30:21.390
(doorbell rings)
(sighs)

30:21.390 --> 30:23.122
JAMES ERSKINE?
YES?

30:23.122 --> 30:24.954
GOOD AFTERNOON, SIR.

30:24.954 --> 30:27.456
I'M WITH THE DEPARTMENT
OF WATER AND POWER.

30:27.456 --> 30:29.498
COMPUTER IS TELLING ME
WE'VE GOT SOME SURGES

30:29.498 --> 30:32.301
AFFECTING SOME HOUSES.
DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK

30:32.301 --> 30:35.304
AT THE MAIN LINE OUT BACK?
TAKE A LOOK.
I NEED YOU TO GET IT FIXED.

30:35.304 --> 30:38.167
WE NEED THE POWER TURNED ON.
COME ON.
(dog barking in distance)

30:38.167 --> 30:40.169
WE'RE THROWING
A BIRTHDAY PARTY HERE,

30:40.169 --> 30:42.171
AND IT'S LIKE
THE MIDDLE AGES.

30:51.420 --> 30:53.322
(door opens)

30:53.322 --> 30:57.226
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MISS HERTZOG.

30:57.226 --> 30:59.128
DO I KNOW YOU?

30:59.128 --> 31:01.190
I'M ZOEY ANDATA.

31:01.190 --> 31:04.063
YOU MET
MY FIANCÃ© DEMETRI NOH.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.335
REMIND ME TO SEND YOU
A CONDOLENCE CARD

31:06.335 --> 31:09.538
IN A COUPLE MONTHS.
YOU CAN SEND ME
A WEDDING PRESENT INSTEAD.

31:09.538 --> 31:12.041
NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO DEMETRI.

31:12.041 --> 31:15.274
ALL PROGNOSTIC EVIDENCE
TO THE CONTRARY.
OH, WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT
THE FUTURE CAN BE CHANGED,

31:15.274 --> 31:17.506
AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
HELP ME CHANGE IT.

31:17.506 --> 31:19.508
I'VE BEEN GOING OVER
THE TRANSCRIPTS

31:19.508 --> 31:22.051
OF YOUR INTERROGATION,
AND I THINK YOU KNOW MORE

31:22.051 --> 31:24.053
THAN YOU'VE TOLD THE FBI,

31:24.053 --> 31:26.185
AND I THINK THAT
WHAT YOU DO KNOW

31:26.185 --> 31:29.158
IS SOMEHOW RELATED
TO DEMETRI'S DEATH.
AND YOU THINK I'D GIVE UP
THIS INFORMATION TO YOU

31:29.158 --> 31:34.223
BECAUSE I'M A BELIEVER
IN TRUE LOVE?
MA'AM, IF YOU LET ME
REPRESENT YOU,

31:34.223 --> 31:36.395
THE ONLY THING
YOU NEED TO BELIEVE IN

31:36.395 --> 31:40.369
IS ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGE.
RIGHT. A FED'S GIRLFRIEND
IS GOING TO EXONERATE ME.

31:40.369 --> 31:42.371
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

31:42.371 --> 31:44.373
IN YOUR FLASH-FORWARD,

31:44.373 --> 31:46.505
WERE YOU IN PRISON?

31:51.580 --> 31:54.243
(whirring, beep)
SO ARE YOU GONNA
FIX THIS THING ALREADY,

31:54.243 --> 31:57.046
OR DO I HAVE
TO CALL SOMEBODY ELSE?

31:57.046 --> 31:59.288
(children shouting and laughing)

31:59.288 --> 32:01.690
I'M NOT HERE
TO FIX YOUR POWER.

32:01.690 --> 32:03.122
WHAT?

32:03.122 --> 32:05.594
I'M HERE TO GET
MY DAUGHTER BACK.

32:05.594 --> 32:09.428
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE
OR WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

32:09.428 --> 32:11.030
TRACY STARK.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.332
I KNOW YOU TOOK HER.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.334
NOW YOU'RE GONNA
GIVE HER BACK.

32:15.334 --> 32:18.437
DADDY, WHEN ARE THEY GONNA
FIX THE POWER?

32:18.437 --> 32:22.311
SOON, BABY. SOON.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

32:22.311 --> 32:24.443
(girl) OKAY.

32:24.443 --> 32:28.117
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
YOUR DAUGHTER BACK.

32:28.117 --> 32:30.219
THEN WE GO TO WAR.

32:30.219 --> 32:33.322
I CAN'T BECAUSE
I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE IS

32:33.322 --> 32:35.184
OR WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT.

32:35.184 --> 32:38.187
AND IF THAT MEANS WE'RE AT WAR,
THEN WE'RE AT WAR.

32:38.187 --> 32:40.189
BUT IF THIS IS
YOUR OPENING SALVO, BUDDY,

32:40.189 --> 32:43.662
I'D CONSIDER SURRENDERING.

32:43.662 --> 32:48.367
YOU KNOW THE GUYS YOU REALLY
GOTTA BE AFRAID OF?

32:48.367 --> 32:51.200
THE ONES WHO GOT
NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.314
(telephone ringing)
YOU'RE GOING TO SOMALIA
WITHOUT ME?

33:05.314 --> 33:09.018
NO ONE KNOWS THAT CASE
BETTER THAN ME.

33:09.018 --> 33:12.321
I UNDERSTAND...
BUT YOU'RE STAYING HERE.

33:12.321 --> 33:15.224
AND IT ISN'T BECAUSE
YOU'RE IRRATIONAL, ERRATIC

33:15.224 --> 33:16.695
AND FREQUENTLY STUPID.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.668
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE ESSENTIAL.
I DON'T LIKE YOU,

33:19.668 --> 33:22.731
BUT, UH, I NEED YOU.
LISTEN, JANIS, DEMETRI--

33:22.731 --> 33:25.134
IF THEY DON'T MAKE IT BACK,
IT'S A TRAGEDY.

33:25.134 --> 33:27.336
BUT IF YOU DON'T,
IT'S A CATASTROPHE.

33:27.336 --> 33:29.538
THE TRUTH IS, MARK,
OUR ENTIRE INVESTIGATION

33:29.538 --> 33:33.042
HINGES ON
WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD.

33:33.042 --> 33:36.145
AND I'M HERE TO MAKE SURE YOU
DON'T LOSE IT BEFORE APRIL 29th.

33:36.145 --> 33:40.149
BUT IN HONG KONG, YOU SAID
MOSAIC WAS BIGGER THAN ME.

33:40.149 --> 33:43.152
I LIED. I'M CIA. I DO THAT.

33:43.152 --> 33:45.394
AND THAT'S WHY NO ONE
TRUSTS YOU FOLK.

33:45.394 --> 33:48.657
YEAH, I DON'T NEED 'EM
TO TRUST ME, MARK.

33:48.657 --> 33:51.200
I JUST NEED THEM
TO DO WHAT I SAY.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.202
YOU'RE STAYING HERE.

33:55.064 --> 33:57.136
(whirring, beeping)

33:57.136 --> 34:01.210
(phone rings)

34:01.210 --> 34:02.311
(man) Yeah?

34:02.311 --> 34:05.144
IT'S ME. JUST HAD A VISIT
FROM THE FATHER.

34:05.144 --> 34:07.576
You're kidding me.
I thought your guy--
what's his name?

34:07.576 --> 34:09.248
Willingham, sir.

34:09.248 --> 34:11.550
Yeah--Willingham. I thought he
was gonna keep an eye on him.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.052
He was. We ended
the surveillance this week.

34:14.052 --> 34:18.056
You want the dad
taken off the board?
THE PACKAGE IS SECURE, RIGHT?
WE NEED TO TALK TO HER,

34:18.056 --> 34:20.229
so make sure she stays alive.
Yeah, it arrived in Kandahar
this morning.

34:20.229 --> 34:22.731
THEN GET RID OF THE FATHER.

34:22.731 --> 34:26.095
(girl) Daddy?
GOTTA GO. IT'S MY TURN
IN THE BOUNCE HOUSE.

34:26.095 --> 34:28.097
HERE I COME, BABY.
(beep)

34:31.340 --> 34:34.243
KANDAHAR.

34:34.243 --> 34:37.246
(cell phone rings)

34:37.246 --> 34:42.151
(ring)

34:42.151 --> 34:45.414
(ring)

34:45.414 --> 34:48.317
(ring)

34:48.317 --> 34:53.392
(ring)

34:53.392 --> 34:55.294
(ring)

34:55.294 --> 34:58.597
(grunts) THEY'RE CALLING YOU
TO KILL ME, MIKEY.
(ring)

34:58.597 --> 35:01.830
TOO BAD YOU GOT PLACES TO BE.
(grunts)

35:01.830 --> 35:05.434
YOU PEOPLE WITH THE FBI
FOUND OUT ABOUT SOMALIA.

35:05.434 --> 35:07.606
AS CIA, I CAN GET US THERE.

35:07.606 --> 35:10.879
THAT'S WHAT BEING A JOINT
TASK FORCE IS ALL ABOUT.

35:10.879 --> 35:14.483
NOW YOU KNOW THE DEAL--
GANWAR REGION, 1991--

35:14.483 --> 35:17.346
CROWS FELL FROM THE SKY.
THERE WERE ANECDOTAL REPORTS

35:17.346 --> 35:19.488
OF A MASS LOSS
OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

35:19.488 --> 35:22.221
ARCHIVED SATELLITE PHOTOS
SHOW FIVE TOWERS

35:22.221 --> 35:25.194
RUNNING A PERIMETER AROUND
THE VILLAGE IN QUESTION.
(beep)

35:25.194 --> 35:27.496
ONE OF THOSE TOWERS
REMAINS STANDING.

35:27.496 --> 35:30.229
OUR GOAL IS TO ACCESS
THAT TOWER AND DETERMINE

35:30.229 --> 35:33.202
IF AND HOW
A BLACKOUT OCCURRED.

35:33.202 --> 35:36.134
ARE WE USING
MARK'S RED PANDA PLAN?

35:36.134 --> 35:38.507
NO. MARK WANTED TO WORK
WITH RED PANDA.

35:38.507 --> 35:42.511
WE'RE GOING AS RED PANDA.
THAT VIOLATES ABOUT A DOZEN
INTERNATIONAL TREATIES.

35:42.511 --> 35:45.214
ARE YOU SURE WE WANT
TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD?

35:45.214 --> 35:47.276
THIS IS INTERNATIONAL
INTELLIGENCE, AGENT HAWK--

35:47.276 --> 35:51.720
CIA JURISDICTION.
IT'S MY BALL TO CALL.
GREAT. WHEN DO WE LEAVE?

35:51.720 --> 35:54.183
WHEN WE LEAVE IS CLASSIFIED.

35:54.183 --> 35:57.686
THE TOWER YOU'RE INVESTIGATING
IS BASED ON MY DESIGNS--

35:57.686 --> 36:01.430
DESIGNS THAT WERE STOLEN FROM ME
WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD.

36:01.430 --> 36:03.932
OUR PLAN IS TO DOCUMENT

36:03.932 --> 36:06.395
THE SITE EXTENSIVELY
FOR YOUR REVIEW.

36:06.395 --> 36:08.867
YOU CAN'T DOCUMENT SOMETHING
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.300
YOU NEED ME ON-SITE.
YOU SHOWED ME THE TOWERS

36:11.300 --> 36:13.272
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE.

36:13.272 --> 36:16.275
I WAS THE ONE WHO TOLD YOU.
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT SOMALIA?

36:16.275 --> 36:18.907
MM, A BIT DRY.
GORGEOUS BEACHES.

36:18.907 --> 36:20.909
IT'S A FAILED STATE.

36:20.909 --> 36:23.282
THEY HAVEN'T HAD A FUNCTIONING
GOVERNMENT SINCE 1991.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.914
OH, I SAW "BLACK HAWK DOWN."
I GET IT.

36:25.914 --> 36:28.887
THE FACT IS, YOU CAN'T MAKE
SENSE OF THE TOWER WITHOUT ME,

36:28.887 --> 36:31.360
AND YOU KNOW IT.

36:33.862 --> 36:37.866
LEARN IT, COVER TO COVER.
MM-HMM.

36:37.866 --> 36:40.229
AND STOP BY MEDICAL
AND GET YOUR SHOTS--

36:40.229 --> 36:42.771
CHOLERA, TYPHUS AND TEN
OTHER BUGS YOU NEVER HEARD OF.

36:42.771 --> 36:46.235
JUST BE WARNED,
WE WILL BE OFF THE RESERVATION.

36:46.235 --> 36:48.707
SO IF THINGS GO SIDEWAYS,
THERE IS NO CAVALRY.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.209
SEE YOU ON THE TARMAC.

36:55.384 --> 36:57.416
HEY.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.418
CAME TO TAKE YOU HOME.

36:59.418 --> 37:03.252
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.
NOT FINISHED HERE YET.

37:03.252 --> 37:07.256
OH, YOU'RE FINISHED.
I SAY YOU'RE FINISHED.

37:07.256 --> 37:09.258
LET'S GO HOME.

37:14.833 --> 37:17.235
YOU, UM...

37:17.235 --> 37:20.609
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT THAT WAS ALL ABOUT?

37:20.609 --> 37:23.412
IT WAS ABOUT
DOING EVERYTHING THAT I CAN

37:23.412 --> 37:26.315
TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE ON THAT BEACH WITH ME

37:26.315 --> 37:28.377
ON OUR WEDDING DAY.

37:28.377 --> 37:30.949
I NEEDED
THOSE FILES BECAUSE...

37:30.949 --> 37:34.623
I'M REPRESENTING
ALDA HERTZOG.

37:34.623 --> 37:36.325
YOU'RE WHAT?

37:36.325 --> 37:38.327
SHE HAS INFORMATION
ABOUT YOUR DEATH,

37:38.327 --> 37:41.830
AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS.
SO I MADE A DEAL WITH HER.
OH, MY...

37:41.830 --> 37:44.833
I GET HER A HEARING.
SHE GIVES ME THE DETAILS.
SHE IS A TERRORIST, ZOEY!
SHE'S A TERRORIST!

37:44.833 --> 37:47.796
A SUSPECTED TERRORIST, DEM,
WITH INFORMATION

37:47.796 --> 37:51.600
THAT MIGHT SAVE THE LIFE
OF THE MAN THAT I LOVE, SO--
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.872
BABY, I WOULD DO ANYTHING--
ANYTHING.

37:53.872 --> 37:58.307
IF I THOUGHT IT COULD SAVE
YOUR LIFE, I'D DO ANYTHING.

38:00.008 --> 38:02.010
I'M SCARED.

38:05.013 --> 38:07.015
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE.

38:09.558 --> 38:11.820
BABY, I LOVE YOU.

38:13.762 --> 38:16.865
(whispering)
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

38:16.865 --> 38:18.997
OKAY.

38:21.029 --> 38:22.971
(normal voice)
OKAY. OKAY.

38:22.971 --> 38:25.874
I LOVE YOU.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.409
COME WITH ME.

38:30.409 --> 38:34.413
THERE'S SOMETHING
I GOTTA TAKE CARE OF.

38:34.413 --> 38:38.747
(phone rings)
(Mark) This is Mark. Leave it
here. I'll get back to you.

38:38.747 --> 38:41.790
(beep)
MARK, JUST CALLING
TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THINGS

38:41.790 --> 38:46.455
HAVE ESCALATED A LITTLE BIT
WITH TRACY'S... FRIENDS.

38:46.455 --> 38:48.457
BUT IT'S OKAY.

38:48.457 --> 38:51.099
I'M GOOD.

38:51.099 --> 38:57.766
THINGS ARE HAPPENING JUST
THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO.

38:57.766 --> 39:02.471
WHOA, BUTTERCREAM FROSTING.
IRINA, THIS CAKE IS OUTSTANDING.

39:02.471 --> 39:04.373
(screams)

39:05.844 --> 39:08.817
(muffled screaming)

39:08.817 --> 39:11.680
I'M GONNA BE GOING OFF THE GRID
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.122
IF YOU NEED ME...
SORRY, MAN.

39:14.122 --> 39:17.586
TAKE HER OUT OF HERE.
(Aaron)
THESE PEOPLE WENT TOO FAR,

39:17.586 --> 39:20.128
AND I'M NOT GONNA LAY DOWN.
(muffled screaming continues)

39:20.128 --> 39:22.991
IT'S MY TIME TO MAKE A MOVE.

39:25.934 --> 39:29.037
I'M IN THIS THING
ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

39:31.600 --> 39:34.072
(whoosh)
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

39:34.072 --> 39:37.976
I'LL ALWAYS FIND YOU,
KIDDO.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.951
(whoosh)
SO LONG, BUDDY.

39:42.951 --> 39:44.953
(starts engine)

39:44.953 --> 39:47.686
(water streaming)

39:47.686 --> 39:51.520
IT'S A SERVICE WEAPON, FORMERLY
BELONGING TO AGENT MARK BENFORD.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.992
SERIAL NUMBER A-5-6-1-9-8-4.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.765
THAT'S THE ONE.
I'LL BRING IT RIGHT OUT.

39:56.765 --> 39:58.767
THANKS.
AND, DEMETRI?

39:58.767 --> 40:00.098
YEAH?
I HAVE A BLOWTORCH
IF YOU WANT.

40:00.098 --> 40:03.131
THANKS, MAN.
ALL RIGHT.

40:03.131 --> 40:05.133
FIGURED I'D JUST RENT A BOAT
AND THROW IT OUT

40:05.133 --> 40:07.135
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN,

40:07.135 --> 40:10.879
BUT, UM, THE THOUGHT
OF WATCHING IT MELT... NOT BAD.

40:10.879 --> 40:14.112
I'M SORRY.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.715
I CAN BE A LITTLE...

40:16.715 --> 40:19.147
CONFRONTATIONAL AT TIMES.

40:19.147 --> 40:20.519
YOU?

40:20.519 --> 40:22.521
NO. (chuckles)

40:22.521 --> 40:25.153
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
YOU LOVE ABOUT ME THOUGH, RIGHT?

40:25.153 --> 40:29.027
IT IS. IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH
CLIPPING THE TOENAILS IN BED.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.959
JERK.
(laughs) COME ON.

40:30.959 --> 40:32.631
(clank)
DEMETRI.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.202
(Demetri) YEAH?

40:34.202 --> 40:35.864
IT'S GONE.

40:35.864 --> 40:38.937
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40:38.937 --> 40:41.610
THE BOX IS HERE.
THE SLIP IS HERE.

40:41.610 --> 40:44.613
BUT THE GUN IS GONE.
