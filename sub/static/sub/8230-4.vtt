It's the fast...

00:18.767 --> 00:22.166
Adam and Jamie live out
their stunt-driver dreams...

00:22.167 --> 00:24.466
He's caught
on the freakin' seat belt.

00:24.467 --> 00:27.999
To tackle a trilogy
of car-chase clichés.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.066
Are Hollywood
getaway gymnastics...

00:31.067 --> 00:33.032
Just like home cookin'.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.399
Possible in the real world?

00:35.400 --> 00:37.132
Whoa! Aah!

00:37.133 --> 00:41.132
Then kari, Grant, and Tory test
the best mythical methods...

00:41.133 --> 00:42.599
Oh, high-end poop.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.899
To keep creepy, cute,
and colossal critters...

Oh, my gosh.

00:47.900 --> 00:49.632

I hate snakes.

Oh, it's gonna go in his pants!
It's gonna go in his pants!

Who are the mythbusters?

What more do you need to know?

01:03.533 --> 01:04.599
And Jamie hyneman.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.232
Things are gonna get
a little crazy in here.

01:07.233 --> 01:11.399
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.132
Together with Tory belleci...

Narrator:
And kari Byron.

01:20.333 --> 01:21.632
Time to wreck this car.

01:21.633 --> 01:24.066
They don't just tell the myths.

01:24.067 --> 01:27.632
They put them to the test.

action-hero ambitions.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.599
Cool. Story
about car crashes, right?

01:42.600 --> 01:43.966
No. No. No.

01:43.967 --> 01:46.532
It's about driving and
cooperating at the same time.

01:46.533 --> 01:47.766
No car crashes?

01:47.767 --> 01:50.466
No car crashes.
Let me fill you in.

01:50.467 --> 01:53.666
In the movies, you often see
two people in a car...

01:53.667 --> 01:55.132
One's driving,
one's a passenger,

01:55.133 --> 01:56.766
and the driver will say,
"you steer!"

01:56.767 --> 01:58.132
And the passenger steers

01:58.133 --> 02:00.866
while the driver operates
the throttle and the brake.

02:00.867 --> 02:03.399
And somehow they still escape
the bad guys.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.932
And i wonder,
how easy is that really?

02:05.933 --> 02:07.499
And then we crash the cars?

02:07.500 --> 02:09.499
[ Sighs ]
Hopefully not.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.232
Doesn't that sound like fun
to try,

02:11.233 --> 02:13.066
just cooperating while driving?

02:13.067 --> 02:14.932
Sure.
[ Laughs ]

02:14.933 --> 02:17.899
No silver-screen car-chase chaos
is complete

02:17.900 --> 02:20.399
without a little daring
and sharing.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.632
Supposedly, when the driver
has his hands full

02:23.633 --> 02:25.199
with a classic cliché,

02:25.200 --> 02:28.799
the passenger can simply
reach over, take the wheel,

02:28.800 --> 02:32.366
and the high-speed action
continues without a hitch.

02:32.367 --> 02:35.532
And to find out if that's
a practical possibility

02:35.533 --> 02:38.432
or a flimsy film fiction,

02:38.433 --> 02:41.599
Adam and Jamie decamp
to a deserted destination.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.866
On your marks!

02:43.867 --> 02:45.266
I'm standing at the end

02:45.267 --> 02:48.566
of the new Jerusalem airport
runway in Tracy, California.

02:48.567 --> 02:50.299
Get set!

02:50.300 --> 02:53.132
About a kilometer and a half
of runway lays out behind me.

02:53.133 --> 02:55.866
It is the perfect place for us
to do all of our testing

02:55.867 --> 02:59.766
without hurting a single soul
except maybe each other.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.899

03:03.833 --> 03:06.666
Eeeeeh! Whoa!

03:06.667 --> 03:08.766
Jamie: This is a classic
movie scenario

03:08.767 --> 03:11.432
where a couple of guys
are trying to outrun somebody

03:11.433 --> 03:13.332
and the driver
becomes compromised

03:13.333 --> 03:15.899
by whatever the shenanigans are
that are going on.

03:15.900 --> 03:18.399
He asks for his passenger
to help him out

03:18.400 --> 03:20.532
by taking control
of the steering wheel.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.732
There we go.

03:21.733 --> 03:23.766
Now, obviously,
this is gonna make

03:23.767 --> 03:25.899
control of the car
kind of difficult,

03:25.900 --> 03:27.366
and that's our first test.

03:27.367 --> 03:30.699
And that's done.
Oh, wait, that's "finish."

03:30.700 --> 03:34.199
Narrator:
So to test the mythical
sharing-is-caring scenario...

03:34.200 --> 03:35.599
Go.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.866
The guys will each
drive a control

03:37.867 --> 03:41.466
through the cone-marked slalom
course at car chase speeds,

03:41.467 --> 03:43.899
then average
both of their times...

03:43.900 --> 03:45.066
Jamie: Finish.

03:45.067 --> 03:46.532
1:04.

03:46.533 --> 03:47.832
And compare that...

03:47.833 --> 03:49.066
Go.

03:49.067 --> 03:51.099
To the time they get

03:51.100 --> 03:53.299
while sharing
the driving duties.

03:53.300 --> 03:57.066
Can you really match
your solo speed and skill

03:57.067 --> 04:00.432
with a co-driver on the wheel
and the other on the pedals?

04:00.433 --> 04:01.666
59 seconds.

04:01.667 --> 04:05.066
That's a combined average
of 62 seconds.

04:05.067 --> 04:08.766
And with their marker laid down,
it's time to partner up.

04:08.767 --> 04:09.667
All right.

and Jamie,

04:18.167 --> 04:20.966
while still controlling
the speed and brakes,

04:20.967 --> 04:23.299
is about to hand over the wheel.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.132
When do you think
you want to take over?

04:25.133 --> 04:26.133

Not bad at all.

It matched
the control time exactly.

pretty good on that test.

without a hitch.

with one hand,

05:36.367 --> 05:38.832
if i might say,
a little nonchalantly,

05:38.833 --> 05:41.599

of one-handed nonchalance,

the conclusion is clearly
gone in 60 seconds.

that we have proven

05:59.068 --> 06:00.266
that driving cooperatively

as driving by yourself,

i want to add to this test,

and I'm gonna bring it up
with Jamie.

that the worst things

are babies and animals?

of mythical animal deterrents.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.499
Like what?

06:36.500 --> 06:38.266
Well, remember when we did
that myth

06:38.267 --> 06:39.799
where we saw if a bag of water

06:39.800 --> 06:42.066
can repel flies
off your front porch?

06:42.067 --> 06:45.066
Apparently bags of water
attract flies.

If you want to keep cats
from digging

07:21.667 --> 07:23.132
or pooping in your garden,

07:23.133 --> 07:25.199
the most popular
are water bottles,

07:25.200 --> 07:27.232
which work so well
with the flies,

07:27.233 --> 07:29.332
and one i don't
entirely understand,

07:29.333 --> 07:30.466
which is lion poop.

07:30.467 --> 07:31.932
Well, let's make a cat house

07:31.933 --> 07:33.866
that's comfy for them
that has a garden,

07:33.867 --> 07:35.932
someplace where
they'd want to go,

07:35.933 --> 07:38.199
and then put out all these
deterrents and see what happens.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.966
So, the setup is simple...

07:39.967 --> 07:43.832
A cat-friendly environment to
make the felines feel at home

07:43.833 --> 07:47.232
and a planter box which the team
will attempt to deter

07:47.233 --> 07:51.332
the determined kitties
from entering and destroying.

07:51.333 --> 07:53.899
The cat house is ready
for its customers.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.799
But first, the all-important
hour-long control.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.366
So, our environment is all set
for our control test,

07:59.367 --> 08:01.266
and we have
the cutest guests ever.

08:01.267 --> 08:03.266
We have four cats
and four kittens.

08:03.267 --> 08:05.399
What we're gonna do
is put 'em in here

08:05.400 --> 08:08.066
and see how many of them

the control test,

08:11.833 --> 08:13.199
then we'll do the test again,

08:13.200 --> 08:15.066
this time deploying
our deterrents.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.732
All of these are said
to be things

08:16.733 --> 08:18.832
that will keep cats
out of your flower bed.

08:18.833 --> 08:21.699
And also, so that
we don't affect the test

08:21.700 --> 08:25.166
by adding extra stimulus,
we're gonna leave the room.

08:25.167 --> 08:27.732
And we're gonna monitor
their behavior

08:27.733 --> 08:29.399
on this remote video feed.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.632
Narrator:
One behavioral pattern

08:31.633 --> 08:35.866
is that all four of the adult
cats love getting high.

08:35.867 --> 08:38.366
Tory:
It's obvious that there's one
place that they all really like,

08:38.367 --> 08:39.866
and that looks like
it's the cat tower.

08:39.867 --> 08:42.266
Narrator:
But the crucial control data

08:42.267 --> 08:45.699
is how many cats go about their
business in the flower bed.

08:45.700 --> 08:47.832
Tory: Look at that. The cat
is peeing in the planter box.

08:47.833 --> 08:48.932
That is perfect.

08:48.933 --> 08:50.199
Dude, they love it.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.199
And with the hour up,
the numbers are in.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.432
Seven of the eight cats visited
the planter box at least once.

08:57.433 --> 09:00.632
But their behavior has warranted
a slight tweak to the test.

09:00.633 --> 09:02.499
Grant: So, when we first
started the test,

09:02.500 --> 09:04.332
we noticed two
really interesting things.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.332
One, all of the kittens
and one of the adults

09:06.333 --> 09:07.932
went straight
for the planter box.

09:07.933 --> 09:11.866
The other is that almost all
the cats go for the tower.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.832
They like being up high.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.499
So when we deploy
our deterrents,

09:15.500 --> 09:19.067
i think we're gonna go for both
the planter and the tower.

09:21.067 --> 09:23.699
Narrator: The first
fan-suggested deterrent

09:23.700 --> 09:25.832
is clear, plastic water bottles.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.766
Will they keep the kitties
out of the flower bed

09:28.767 --> 09:30.499
and their favorite cat tower?

09:30.500 --> 09:32.066
All right.
I think that's enough.

09:32.067 --> 09:33.599
And how?

09:33.600 --> 09:34.799
Tory: So, this whole theory
that the water bottle

09:34.800 --> 09:36.066
is a good cat repellent

09:36.067 --> 09:38.432
is similar to the one
that it repels flies.

09:38.433 --> 09:40.866
The idea is that the sunlight
hits the water,

09:40.867 --> 09:43.332
it refracts the light,
and creates confusion.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.766
Be free!

09:44.767 --> 09:46.066
It didn't work for the flies,

09:46.067 --> 09:47.932
and cats are a lot smarter
than flies.

09:47.933 --> 09:50.499
So my feeling is it's not
gonna work for them, either.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.399
Narrator: With stage lights
directed onto the bottles

09:53.400 --> 09:55.432
creating the laser-like
light show

09:55.433 --> 09:57.299
that cats are supposed to hate,

09:57.300 --> 09:59.566
the early signs
are mildly encouraging.

09:59.567 --> 10:02.932
Okay, they're sort of like,
"what is this?

10:02.933 --> 10:04.799
What are these things
everywhere?"

10:04.800 --> 10:06.166
I don't know.

10:06.167 --> 10:08.999
Narrator: But it's no more
than a moment's hesitation.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.299
Despite the light-reflecting
water bottles

10:11.300 --> 10:13.232
liberally placed
in the key areas,

10:13.233 --> 10:16.832
the cats exhibit identical
behavior as the control

10:16.833 --> 10:19.566
and do exactly
what they want to do,

10:19.567 --> 10:21.399
where they want to do it.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.532
Grant:
So there you have it.

10:22.533 --> 10:23.766
Within 15 minutes,

10:23.767 --> 10:25.666
all of our cats except for one

10:25.667 --> 10:28.799
entered the box with
all the water bottles in it.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.066
And some even did
their business.

10:31.067 --> 10:33.732
Narrator: So with the first
home-spun deterrent done,

10:33.733 --> 10:35.599
it's 0 for 1.

10:35.600 --> 10:38.966
Which leaves one final
Internet-inspired

10:38.967 --> 10:40.599
feline force field.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.032
Now for the mythical deterrent

10:42.033 --> 10:44.133
we've all really been
looking forward to...

10:45.767 --> 10:47.832

on the fence.

10:52.767 --> 10:54.132
Ugh!

10:54.133 --> 10:56.432
Eww, it's sticking to my hand!
Bleh.

10:56.433 --> 10:58.732
I don't know why anybody
would want to use something

10:58.733 --> 11:00.599
this vile and disgusting

11:00.600 --> 11:03.732
to keep the cats from going
in your garden

11:03.733 --> 11:05.132
and leaving something vile
and disgusting.

11:05.133 --> 11:09.066
There's little pieces of
un-chewed guts and fur in here.

11:09.067 --> 11:11.599
Maybe if it was just a perimeter

11:11.600 --> 11:16.266
and you had a very large garden
and no sense of smell.

11:16.267 --> 11:18.266
Narrator:
Kari may be dubious...

11:18.267 --> 11:20.432
All right. Cats are in.
Let's get out of here.

11:20.433 --> 11:23.499
But the theory is that
by marking off the territory

11:23.500 --> 11:27.066
with the spore of a big cat,
the kitty cats will steer clear.

11:27.067 --> 11:29.432
Kari: When you guys
dropped the kittens,

11:29.433 --> 11:31.866
last time,
they kind of just ran in.

11:31.867 --> 11:34.066
They're sniffing around
the perimeter.

11:34.067 --> 11:35.566
They're not crossing the poop.

11:35.567 --> 11:38.199
Narrator:
They're clearly cautious cats.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.232
A new smell, a new stimulus.
Something's afoot.

11:41.233 --> 11:44.399
But with no signs
of an actual lion,

11:44.400 --> 11:47.532
it only causes our furry-pawed
friends to merely "pause."

11:47.533 --> 11:48.766
Tory: Oh, look.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.899
Now they're starting to go
inside the planter.

11:50.900 --> 11:52.666
It doesn't seem to be working.

11:52.667 --> 11:54.766
No, it's definitely not forming

11:54.767 --> 11:57.499
a protective barrier
around the flower bed.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.666
Narrator: And by the time
the time is up,

11:59.667 --> 12:01.766
not only is their
behavior unaffected,

12:01.767 --> 12:03.299
the numbers match the control.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.632
Seven out of eight
visit the flower bed.

12:05.633 --> 12:08.599
All right. So, lion poop
as a cat repellent,

12:08.600 --> 12:09.632
totally busted.

12:09.633 --> 12:11.366
Yeah.
Definitely busted.

12:11.367 --> 12:12.632
Yeah, busted.

12:12.633 --> 12:14.732
And believe me, the cure
is worse than the disease.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.832
Yes! [ Laughs ]

any success at all

12:18.933 --> 12:20.632
finding any cat deterrents.

12:20.633 --> 12:23.799
None of them were able
to discourage any of the cats

12:23.800 --> 12:25.566
to go into any of our spaces.

12:25.567 --> 12:28.699
In fact, the kittens,
being so curious,

12:28.700 --> 12:30.832
blew right past all of them.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.099
So now we're gonna
move on to snakes.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.466
Narrator: Yep.
How do you stop a serpent

12:35.467 --> 12:37.966
from sliding into secret,
forbidden spaces?

12:37.967 --> 12:40.799

It's gonna go in his pants!

what that bump was.

for this test.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.266
I want to bring it up with you.

13:23.267 --> 13:24.632
What's that?

13:24.633 --> 13:26.599
Well, if you were driving a car
and i was steering it,

13:26.600 --> 13:27.732
in an action movie,

13:27.733 --> 13:29.466
the reason would be
so that you, the driver,

13:29.467 --> 13:31.632
would have your hands free
to shoot at something.

13:31.633 --> 13:34.899

13:34.900 --> 13:36.666
[ Chuckling ]
Let's say bad guys.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.132
So, I'm thinking,

13:38.133 --> 13:41.132
let's give ourselves a gun
and some targets to shoot at

13:41.133 --> 13:42.299
and run this test again.

13:42.300 --> 13:43.333
Sure. Why not?

13:44.733 --> 13:48.099
Jamie: So we tried driving with
one of us on the steering wheel

13:48.100 --> 13:49.666
and one of us on the pedals.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.632
That actually worked
pretty well.

13:51.633 --> 13:53.966
But now we're gonna be doing
some multitasking.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.899
We're still gonna have
the same setup,

13:55.900 --> 13:59.066
but the guy in the driver's seat
is also going to be aiming

13:59.067 --> 14:01.332
and shooting at targets
along the road

14:01.333 --> 14:02.666
while they're under way.

14:02.667 --> 14:05.566

loaded and locked,

over 50% of my targets.

that i drove slower...

as far as the movies go,

as they make it out to be?

Well, buster, i hope
that was as much fun for you

37:15.400 --> 37:16.599
as it was for me.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.666
It presented some challenges.

37:18.667 --> 37:21.499
Like, he got tangled
in his seat belt.

37:21.500 --> 37:24.666
He's caught
on the freakin' seat belt.

37:24.667 --> 37:27.599
And then his feet got caught
in the hinge of the car.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.332
Are you dragging him?

37:29.333 --> 37:30.666
That was an experience.

37:30.667 --> 37:33.699
Narrator: An experience
buster has to relive...

37:33.700 --> 37:35.832
Or, more to the point, re-die.

37:35.833 --> 37:38.699
This is gonna be so much fun.

37:38.700 --> 37:41.966
But this time, it's Adam
who's kicking out the carcass.

37:41.967 --> 37:43.199
All right. Go!

37:43.200 --> 37:46.132
It's that old
car-chase Chestnut.

37:46.133 --> 37:49.232
Dead guys can't drive.

37:49.233 --> 37:50.532
Dude is dead!
What do we do?!

37:50.533 --> 37:53.099
First up, Adam gets his foot
across to the pedals,

37:53.100 --> 37:55.199
and then with the car
under control,

37:55.200 --> 37:57.066
it's bye-bye, buster.

37:57.067 --> 37:59.366
You got to get out of the car.

37:59.367 --> 38:01.432
Oh, whoa, whoa.

38:01.433 --> 38:03.632
Adam: Well, that was both easier
and harder

38:03.633 --> 38:04.633
than i thought it would be.

38:04.634 --> 38:05.699
All right. Here i go.

38:05.700 --> 38:06.899
Harder because you forget

38:06.900 --> 38:08.866
that when you're driving
a car forward,

38:08.867 --> 38:10.699
opening one of the doors
is not trivial.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.132
Aah!

38:12.133 --> 38:15.066
But i finally managed to put
my shoulder up against buster.

38:15.067 --> 38:17.299
Come on! Come on!

38:17.300 --> 38:19.132
That's it!
[ Laughs ]

38:19.133 --> 38:21.566
Yes! Whoo!

38:21.567 --> 38:24.399
I only had to get a little bit
of him outside the door

38:24.400 --> 38:26.332
for gravity to do
the rest for me.

38:26.333 --> 38:29.199
I've got control of the car.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.166
Yeah!

38:31.167 --> 38:33.399
Narrator:
Done and dumped,

38:33.400 --> 38:36.666
and in a suitably high-speed
car-chase time.

38:36.667 --> 38:38.232
[ Both laugh ]

38:38.233 --> 38:39.699
That was far out.

38:39.700 --> 38:40.932
It works.

38:40.933 --> 38:43.132
If not with
cinematic slickness...

38:43.133 --> 38:44.766
Come on!

38:44.767 --> 38:47.299
Certainly with a physically
brutal effectiveness.

38:47.300 --> 38:50.266
That's it! [ Laughs ]

38:50.267 --> 38:54.699
From buster's perspective,
it was less "wow" and more "ow."

38:54.700 --> 38:57.932
But the good news is
it's a wrap.

38:57.933 --> 39:01.199
How are we gonna call kicking
a body out of the car at speed?

39:01.200 --> 39:04.466
Well, it ain't easy,
but it's plausible.

39:04.467 --> 39:05.732
It's plausible.

39:05.733 --> 39:07.599
I like doing the driving myths
on "mythbusters."

39:07.600 --> 39:09.766
It's given us quite
the education, isn't it?

39:09.767 --> 39:12.566
Yeah. You never know when
it'll come in handy, do you?

39:12.567 --> 39:15.066
You want to ride back?

39:15.067 --> 39:18.200
Uh, no, I'm cool.
I'll walk myself back.

39:19.700 --> 39:22.432
I don't know
what he's nervous about.

39:22.433 --> 39:26.432
[ Tires screech ]

39:26.433 --> 39:29.532
One hour a week of "mythbusters"
not enough for you?

39:29.533 --> 39:32.767
There's lots more online
at discovery.Com/mythbusters.

39:35.767 --> 39:40.332
Narrator:
Can you keep a bear out of your
car-stored pic-a-nic basket?

39:40.333 --> 39:43.532
Grant: So, this is what happens
when you don't have a deterrent.

39:43.533 --> 39:45.732
[ Bear growls ]

39:45.733 --> 39:48.766
Which brings us to our first
deterrent, ammonia-soaked rags.

39:48.767 --> 39:51.499
Narrator: It's another
strong scent-based theory,

39:51.500 --> 39:54.499
but has it any chance
of success?

39:54.500 --> 39:56.699
Tory: Now, i don't know if
it's the scent of the ammonia

39:56.700 --> 39:58.266
that's covering the scent
of the food

39:58.267 --> 40:00.099
or just the irritation
of the actual ammonia.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.066
Kind of like we're decorating
a Christmas tree.

40:02.067 --> 40:04.232
I mean, i know as i was pouring
the ammonia on,

40:04.233 --> 40:06.299
my eyes were burning,
i couldn't breathe,

40:06.300 --> 40:08.199
and right now
i can't smell anything.

40:08.200 --> 40:09.566
Now, remember, though,

40:09.567 --> 40:12.599
bears smell 75 times better
than a German Shepherd.

40:12.600 --> 40:15.166
So i have a feeling
this one's gonna work.

40:15.167 --> 40:16.666
[ Bear roars ]

40:16.667 --> 40:17.866
Narrator: Tory's confident

40:17.867 --> 40:20.599
because with the lunch
repacked and reloaded,

40:20.600 --> 40:22.299
the pungent aroma of ammonia

40:22.300 --> 40:25.132
will surely put
the bear off his food

40:25.133 --> 40:28.166
and cause him to steer clear
of the car.

40:28.167 --> 40:29.699
All right.
Time to bring out the bear.

40:29.700 --> 40:31.832
Kari: You know,
i actually predict

40:31.833 --> 40:33.966
that the ammonia
is not gonna work

40:33.967 --> 40:37.199
because the ammonia smells
a little bit like urine to me,

40:37.200 --> 40:39.932
which is something
that wouldn't put them off.

40:39.933 --> 40:41.799
I think he's just still
gonna open that door,

40:41.800 --> 40:43.199
be like, "there's food in there.

40:43.200 --> 40:45.566
Let me get these urine-y,
smelly rags out of the way."

40:45.567 --> 40:47.832
Narrator:
After a confident swagger,

40:47.833 --> 40:50.799
it's a prediction proven
with one nonchalant flick

40:50.800 --> 40:54.199
of a meaty paw, and this time,
he pops open the front door.

40:54.200 --> 40:58.599
So, he's just opened the door
with the soaked rags.

40:58.600 --> 41:02.732
The ammonia has done nothing
to keep that bear from it.

41:02.733 --> 41:03.966
He opened the door!

41:03.967 --> 41:05.399
How does a bear know how
to open doors?

41:05.400 --> 41:08.466
Narrator: He's, uh, smarter
than the average bear.

41:08.467 --> 41:12.466
But the point is, was he put off
by the deterrent?

41:12.467 --> 41:14.499
Grant: So, there are two
interesting things

41:14.500 --> 41:16.599
that i notice about this test.

41:16.600 --> 41:19.432
The ammonia-soaked rags did not
deter the bear at all.

41:19.433 --> 41:22.432
Second thing, when you think
bear, you think destruction.

41:22.433 --> 41:23.932
But in this case,

41:23.933 --> 41:26.566
the bear actually
has amazing dexterity,

41:26.567 --> 41:31.500
enough dexterity to open a door
and pull a cooler out.

41:32.767 --> 41:35.532
I'd have to say as far
as ammonia-soaked rags go,

41:35.533 --> 41:37.066
this one's busted.

[ Bear roars ]

the fruits...

41:41.967 --> 41:43.232
Well, peanut butter...

Of his car-opening labor
back in his trailer,

41:45.733 --> 41:47.466

41:47.467 --> 41:50.532
for their final attempt
at a nasal knock-back.

41:50.533 --> 41:54.399
Next up, cayenne pepper.

41:54.400 --> 41:57.932
Cayenne pepper, a tasty
condiment in cajun cooking.

41:57.933 --> 42:00.266
I don't know
if it's gonna repel a bear,

42:00.267 --> 42:02.266
but it's working on me.
[ Coughs ]

ingredient in pepper spray.

42:05.067 --> 42:06.232
Okay, the bear's
about to come out.

42:06.233 --> 42:07.932
Narrator: Here he comes,

42:07.933 --> 42:11.766
700 pounds of lumbering,
powerful, unstoppable appetite.

42:11.767 --> 42:13.499
Or is he?

42:13.500 --> 42:17.166
His behavior is diverging
from the two previous tests.

42:17.167 --> 42:18.532
He's clearly hesitating.

42:18.533 --> 42:21.266
Look, he's sort of,
like, sniffing the air.

42:21.267 --> 42:23.599

Could this be the one?

42:23.600 --> 42:25.166
Tory: Wow. The cayenne
pepper looks like

42:25.167 --> 42:27.066
it's actually keeping the bear
away from the Van.

42:27.067 --> 42:28.632
Grant: Yeah, you know,
in the other test,

42:28.633 --> 42:31.532
he went straight to the Van,
sniffed around, and went in.

42:31.533 --> 42:33.399
This time,
he's just kid of avoiding it.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.666

the Van.

Out of view on the far side
of the vehicle...

of claws, teeth, and fur

breaches the hot wire...

42:45.667 --> 42:48.899
That is supposed to be, like,
the ultimate barrier for him.

42:48.900 --> 42:52.632
Rather than go near the car
peppered with pepper.

in the form of
a marshmallow treat or 10,

within the safe perimeter.

for bear repellent!

43:05.267 --> 43:08.232
the active ingredient
in the cayenne pepper,

43:08.233 --> 43:10.832
is such a concentrated
nasal irritant

43:10.833 --> 43:12.232
it was just too much

43:12.233 --> 43:14.866
for the bear's hypersensitive
nose to bear.

43:14.867 --> 43:16.132
And finally,

43:16.133 --> 43:20.066
the team has one homemade recipe
that actually works.

43:20.067 --> 43:22.066
All right, kari.
