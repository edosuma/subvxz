WEBVTT

00:03.535 --> 00:04.535
Henry Winchester.

00:04.737 --> 00:07.137
- That's our grandfather.
- You're Men of Letters, correct?

00:07.373 --> 00:08.465
Our father taught us
how to be hunters.

00:08.707 --> 00:09.765
You're legacies.

00:10.009 --> 00:11.237
Preceptors, beholders,

00:11.443 --> 00:14.412
chroniclers of all that which
man does not understand.

00:14.647 --> 00:16.774
Larry Ganem and Albert Magnus.
All deceased.

00:16.949 --> 00:17.949
Albertus Magnus.

00:18.150 --> 00:20.710
His was the alias we'd use
when going incognito.

00:21.287 --> 00:22.515
Here's the deal.

00:22.855 --> 00:24.152
You're gonna tell us
how to hack an angel,

00:24.390 --> 00:25.982
and I'm gonna give you
some human blood.

00:26.258 --> 00:27.623
Word is you're jonesing for it.

00:28.027 --> 00:30.018
The Knights of Hell
aren't exactly the dying kind.

00:30.262 --> 00:32.389
But there is something
that can kill a knight.

00:32.631 --> 00:33.689
The First Blade.

00:34.099 --> 00:35.259
It's the bloody Mark of Cain.

00:35.434 --> 00:37.595
Without the Mark,
the Blade is useless.

00:37.836 --> 00:39.133
The Mark can be transferred
to someone who's worthy.

00:39.305 --> 00:41.933
But you have to know,
with the Mark comes a great burden.

00:42.174 --> 00:43.198
So, where is the Blade?

00:43.442 --> 00:44.739
I threw it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.

00:44.977 --> 00:47.138
You can't search the bottom
of the ocean, but I can.

00:47.346 --> 00:50.315
So, I'll find it and
bring it to its new owner.

00:57.022 --> 00:59.149
Come on, Crowley.
Pick up!

01:01.060 --> 01:03.426
Where the hell is he?
It's not like he's got a social life.

01:04.430 --> 01:05.624
Are you actually worried?

01:05.864 --> 01:08.332
Too busy inflicting pain to answer.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.228
Leave a message.

01:09.435 --> 01:10.435
Guy's got one job.

01:10.736 --> 01:12.203
Find the First Blade, bring it back.

01:12.438 --> 01:14.030
- How hard is that?
- It's Crowley.

01:14.273 --> 01:15.513
He's not exactly a team player.

01:15.607 --> 01:17.768
Yeah, but his ass is on the line, too.

01:18.043 --> 01:20.170
He goes missing for weeks
on end without a peep?

01:20.412 --> 01:21.640
Well, not one
that makes sense, anyway.

01:21.880 --> 01:23.541
Listen to this.

01:24.183 --> 01:26.651
Dean, um...

01:32.358 --> 01:33.358
Wait a second.

01:33.559 --> 01:35.891
Did he...
Drunk-dial you?

01:43.969 --> 01:45.061
Come on.

01:58.417 --> 01:59.975
Lola?

02:01.887 --> 02:03.149
My King?

02:04.223 --> 02:06.623
My apres-consummation treat.

02:06.859 --> 02:08.952
On it, sire.

02:32.284 --> 02:33.876
Pantry's almost empty.

02:35.154 --> 02:37.088
We'll need another volunteer.

02:37.356 --> 02:39.153
You should add that
to your "to do" list.

02:55.574 --> 02:57.667
Lola, pet?

02:57.843 --> 03:00.539
I do believe I'm ravenous.

03:14.059 --> 03:16.425
And a weakling.

03:19.031 --> 03:20.191
No.

03:20.432 --> 03:22.423
Richard, I'm sorry.

03:22.634 --> 03:25.398
I'm sorry, but...
You are our last hope.

03:25.604 --> 03:27.162
If you don't help us...

03:27.406 --> 03:29.033
...Victor Laszlo
will die in Casablanca.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.574
What of it?
I'm gonna die in Casablanca.

03:31.743 --> 03:33.643
It's a good spot for it.

03:39.451 --> 03:40.645
Now, if you...

04:01.340 --> 04:03.103
My name is Aldo.

04:03.342 --> 04:05.276
My intel is for Abaddon...

04:05.544 --> 04:06.272
Minion.

04:06.512 --> 04:08.480
And she appreciates
the work you've been doing.

04:08.647 --> 04:10.512
At great peril.

04:10.749 --> 04:12.376
But she is tied up securing her place

04:12.618 --> 04:14.381
as new leader of the kingdom.

04:14.620 --> 04:17.521
She assures you that
all relevant information

04:17.755 --> 04:19.656
can be conveyed to me.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.087
So, update?

04:29.067 --> 04:31.092
The King is off his game.

04:31.303 --> 04:33.100
Except for sex, pizza,

04:33.272 --> 04:34.933
and human blood,
he has no interests.

04:35.140 --> 04:37.165
He can't function without me.

04:37.409 --> 04:38.307
- Well played.
- I should mention

04:38.477 --> 04:41.810
he keeps getting phone calls
from those Winchesters.

04:44.283 --> 04:45.682
They leave voicemails for him.

04:45.884 --> 04:46.884
Saying?

04:47.052 --> 04:48.383
Mostly, they're rude.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.520
One mentioned something
called the First Blade.

04:53.659 --> 04:55.092
Interesting.

04:56.361 --> 04:58.556
Follow how this develops
and report in.

04:58.730 --> 05:00.027
Oh, I will.

05:00.198 --> 05:01.198
And when I do,

05:01.366 --> 05:04.301
I expect to report directly
to the next Queen of Hell.

05:04.503 --> 05:06.130
Capiche?

05:31.630 --> 05:33.598
All right, do it.

05:35.534 --> 05:38.935
Daemon...

05:47.479 --> 05:48.707
Winchesters.

05:53.852 --> 05:54.978
Is that...

05:55.287 --> 05:56.327
Well, that explains a lot.

05:58.023 --> 06:00.321
Okay.
Look, Snooki.

06:00.626 --> 06:01.650
Can I call you "Snooki"?

06:01.927 --> 06:03.485
No.
It's Nicole now.

06:04.563 --> 06:07.088
Okay, then.
Nicole.

06:07.299 --> 06:09.062
We can do this one of two ways.

06:09.301 --> 06:12.031
The easy way.
You talk.

06:12.237 --> 06:15.798
Or...
The easier way.

06:15.974 --> 06:18.306
- You still talk.
- I vote for number two.

06:18.443 --> 06:21.310
We just want some basic
information on Crowley. That's it.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.141
Google him.
Are we done?

06:26.184 --> 06:28.345
Whoa! Not the face!
Are you crazy?

06:28.520 --> 06:30.647
Listen, guys, what happens
in Hell stays in Hell.

06:30.856 --> 06:31.856
I got nothin'.

06:31.857 --> 06:34.849
But you do have a pretty sweet deal
with Crowley in charge.

06:35.027 --> 06:37.461
If Abaddon wins,
you can kiss all that goodbye.

06:37.696 --> 06:39.755
All the fancy cars, the book deals.

06:39.998 --> 06:41.226
Showbiz can be tough.

06:41.433 --> 06:42.627
I'm doing fine.
Thanks.

06:42.901 --> 06:44.232
Well, good luck

06:44.436 --> 06:46.996
landing your next gig
inside a Devil's Trap.

06:47.172 --> 06:48.172
What do you want to know?

06:48.206 --> 06:49.639
Where is Crowley?

06:49.808 --> 06:52.675
Last time I heard, he was
somewhere in the western Pacific.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.270
- Makes sense.
- Really?

06:56.481 --> 06:59.314
Floating around in the ocean while
his kingdom goes up in flames?

06:59.484 --> 07:00.678
Meaning?

07:00.886 --> 07:02.183
Hell's gettin' crazy.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.446
Even the loyalists
want to sign on with Abaddon.

07:04.656 --> 07:05.918
She's gonna make her move.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.060
Are we done?
I got a thing.

07:18.303 --> 07:19.895
Seriously?
An exorcism?

07:20.105 --> 07:22.164
- We had a deal!
- See ya, Snooks.

07:29.347 --> 07:31.372
Honey, I'm home.

07:32.918 --> 07:34.078
Hello, pumpkin.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.782
Did you have a nice day?

07:37.823 --> 07:40.121
Lola did some shopping.

07:40.892 --> 07:43.360
Looks like Lola did
a lot of shopping.

07:43.495 --> 07:45.986
But not all of it's for me.

07:46.131 --> 07:47.655
Looky, looky.

07:52.137 --> 07:55.402
I hope it's a good vintage.

07:55.607 --> 07:57.871
Well, you look like you
could use a little pick-me-up.

07:58.043 --> 08:00.477
I just love
what it does for you.

08:02.647 --> 08:04.171
Do you?

08:12.924 --> 08:15.586
You tried to play me?

08:15.761 --> 08:17.058
I play the tune!

08:17.229 --> 08:20.164
Everyone else dances to it.

08:20.298 --> 08:21.424
- Got it?
- Yes!

08:21.633 --> 08:22.861
I'm your slave.

08:23.068 --> 08:24.626
You're my rodent.

08:24.836 --> 08:26.861
My little rodent
who went scurrying off

08:27.105 --> 08:28.629
to Abaddon to rat on me.

08:28.874 --> 08:30.068
No! No.

08:30.275 --> 08:33.676
Do you really think
some other lowlife

08:33.879 --> 08:34.971
wouldn't sell you out?

08:36.181 --> 08:37.511
I thought you were a smart girl.

08:37.783 --> 08:40.717
A girl I could've helped.

08:43.955 --> 08:45.354
You're joking, right?

08:47.125 --> 08:49.650
You help me?

08:52.364 --> 08:54.992
Look at yourself.

08:55.133 --> 08:58.159
You couldn't help anyone.

09:59.798 --> 10:01.493
Hey.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.430
So, Cain said
the First Blade was tossed

10:04.669 --> 10:06.034
in the deepest ocean, right?

10:06.271 --> 10:07.898
That's the Mariana Trench.

10:08.173 --> 10:11.472
Maybe Crowley found it,
and it's a double-cross.

10:12.644 --> 10:14.111
That doesn't make sense.

10:14.346 --> 10:16.186
He wants me to power it up
and kill the ginger.

10:16.348 --> 10:17.542
He set it up.

10:18.884 --> 10:22.149
Okay. Assuming
he does show up with it

10:22.320 --> 10:24.686
Crowley is only useful to us
until we have the Blade.

10:26.024 --> 10:27.582
Yeah. So?

10:28.960 --> 10:29.984
So...

10:30.896 --> 10:34.662
There's nothing stopping us
from using it on him, right?

10:37.502 --> 10:38.502
Nothing at all.

10:44.242 --> 10:46.472
Speak of the devil.

10:47.345 --> 10:49.210
Did you find the First Blade?

10:49.347 --> 10:51.872
Not exactly.

10:52.050 --> 10:54.041
Well, then, what, exactly?

10:56.454 --> 10:58.046
I'm in...

10:58.290 --> 11:00.053
A jam of sorts.

11:01.893 --> 11:03.622
Thought you might help.

11:21.479 --> 11:22.479
Hello, boys.

11:23.915 --> 11:26.440
And what do you call this?

11:26.685 --> 11:28.277
Refreshments?

11:29.688 --> 11:31.248
- What's in the bag, Crowley?
- Nothing.

11:31.456 --> 11:33.447
Really?
Maybe I can...

11:38.596 --> 11:41.030
What, are you knocking over
blood banks?

11:47.005 --> 11:48.370
Come on, guys.

11:53.278 --> 11:55.337
Look at you.
You're a mess.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.175
You know, we were counting on you.
You let us down.

11:57.415 --> 11:59.713
Your slimy followers were
counting on you to kill Abaddon,

11:59.951 --> 12:01.543
and you let them down.

12:01.686 --> 12:03.847
The man with all the mojo.
Captain Evil.

12:04.055 --> 12:05.249
It's pathetic.

12:06.157 --> 12:07.647
What is this?

12:07.859 --> 12:08.883
An intervention?

12:09.027 --> 12:11.495
You need to focus, Crowley.

12:11.696 --> 12:12.696
Get a grip!

12:12.797 --> 12:13.957
What, you just gonna
let Hell go to Hell?

12:14.165 --> 12:17.931
You don't know
what it's like to be human!

12:22.707 --> 12:24.231
It's your DNA.

12:24.409 --> 12:26.206
It's my addiction,

12:26.478 --> 12:28.639
my cross, my burden!

12:28.913 --> 12:29.937
All right, take it easy.

12:30.181 --> 12:33.048
I see the darkness of it now,
the Anthony Weiner of it.

12:33.318 --> 12:35.718
It makes you needy.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.387
I needed her.

12:37.555 --> 12:40.115
Lola used me.

12:40.325 --> 12:43.192
She reported everything I did
back to Abaddon.

12:45.864 --> 12:47.695
Crowley.

12:47.932 --> 12:50.423
Did you tell her
about the First Blade?

12:51.569 --> 12:52.569
I don't know.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.999
Things get a trifle blurry
when I'm medicated.

12:59.277 --> 13:00.277
Great.

13:00.512 --> 13:03.970
If he told Lola,
she definitely told Abaddon.

13:04.215 --> 13:06.115
Which means that Abaddon's
in the hunt for this thing, too.

13:06.384 --> 13:08.716
All right, you know what?
This crap ends now.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.320
You're cut off.
Okay?

13:11.489 --> 13:13.980
Kicking it.
Cold turkey.

13:18.163 --> 13:20.654
Back in this fetid pit.

13:20.899 --> 13:23.561
Could at least have added
some throw pillows.

13:24.869 --> 13:26.268
Focus.

13:26.504 --> 13:27.504
Okay.

13:27.705 --> 13:29.866
You swept the Mariana Trench.
And?

13:30.942 --> 13:34.708
And the First Blade was not,
as hoped, in the trench.

13:35.013 --> 13:37.948
It had, in fact, been scooped up
by an unmanned sub

13:38.249 --> 13:40.183
from whom it was stolen
by a research assistant

13:40.452 --> 13:43.114
who reportedly sold it
to Portuguese smugglers

13:43.354 --> 13:46.755
who in turn, lost it to Moroccan pirates
in a poker game.

13:48.893 --> 13:49.893
What?

13:50.161 --> 13:51.253
Poor moose.

13:51.496 --> 13:54.056
It's always a little tricky
keeping up, isn't it?

14:03.308 --> 14:04.502
What are you doing?

14:07.412 --> 14:10.210
I'm still a little tainted
by humanity.

14:11.783 --> 14:13.478
Makes me sentimental.

14:14.986 --> 14:16.715
Well, stop.

14:18.056 --> 14:21.150
You and I both know we shared
a mo back in that church.

14:21.459 --> 14:23.586
And on some level, we are bonded.

14:23.862 --> 14:26.922
Crowley, the only reason
you are alive

14:27.165 --> 14:29.690
is that we need your help
to deal with Abaddon

14:29.934 --> 14:33.335
'cause she is an even worse
pile of crap than you are.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.265
And that is the extent
of my concern for you.

14:35.440 --> 14:36.440
Got it?

14:37.942 --> 14:41.002
Okay. What happened
after the pirates?

14:52.657 --> 14:54.181
What is Crowley doing?

14:57.695 --> 14:59.424
- Stealing candy.
- He's...

14:59.631 --> 15:00.631
He's stealing candy.

15:02.667 --> 15:04.667
You know, at least
when Cass was human he was an...

15:04.802 --> 15:05.996
okay guy.

15:06.171 --> 15:08.765
Should've known Crowley
would be a douche version.

15:11.142 --> 15:13.076
Hey. Hey!

15:14.512 --> 15:15.536
Cut it out, man!

15:15.747 --> 15:17.339
Image!

15:17.515 --> 15:20.211
You're the king of rotten.
Act like it.

15:28.326 --> 15:29.350
You really think
this guy's gonna show up?

15:29.594 --> 15:32.461
I mean, this isn't exactly a place
where million-dollar deals go down.

15:32.697 --> 15:35.257
Look, word is,
this Andre Develin character

15:35.500 --> 15:38.333
bought the Blade from the pirates,
and he's been shopping it around.

15:38.536 --> 15:40.163
That's all I know.

15:40.371 --> 15:41.599
Hey, heads up.

15:46.377 --> 15:48.277
Mr. Develin,
we spoke on the phone.

15:50.381 --> 15:52.076
You said you represent
a serious collector

15:52.317 --> 15:54.751
with an interest
in a private transaction.

15:55.019 --> 15:56.543
Did he? Oh.

15:56.754 --> 15:59.154
Well, what he meant
to say was is that we are with

15:59.290 --> 16:00.348
the FBI.

16:01.226 --> 16:02.386
- Then good evening.
- Wait a second.

16:02.627 --> 16:03.753
We just want some answers.

16:04.696 --> 16:08.063
Read Sartre.
Jean-Paul Sartre.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.458
I'm merely a facilitator between
the buyer and the seller.

16:11.769 --> 16:13.236
A conduit.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.404
So, unless I'm being detained...

16:35.560 --> 16:36.560
So, am I?

16:38.863 --> 16:39.863
Being detained?

16:40.932 --> 16:42.627
Not at the moment.

16:42.967 --> 16:45.765
No, but we've got our eyes on you.

16:54.812 --> 16:56.746
National Institute of Antiquities.

17:07.625 --> 17:08.625
Gin.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.125
Again.

17:48.066 --> 17:50.694
Brought you guys something
for your shift.

17:57.375 --> 17:58.967
What's going on?

18:16.260 --> 18:17.852
I don't have much for you guys.

18:18.096 --> 18:19.358
The guards were good men.

18:19.597 --> 18:22.395
They'd been here for years.
Vetted, honest.

18:22.633 --> 18:23.793
- But...
- But?

18:24.102 --> 18:25.899
Security camera shows
a research assistant

18:26.137 --> 18:27.817
caught them breaking into
vault number one.

18:28.806 --> 18:29.806
That's her?

18:31.109 --> 18:32.109
Gets weirder.

19:01.272 --> 19:02.272
Like I said.

19:02.507 --> 19:04.707
Anything special about
the particular vault they opened?

19:04.709 --> 19:07.940
Vault number one is where
they keep rare, new acquisitions

19:08.179 --> 19:10.010
while they're being examined.

19:10.181 --> 19:11.181
So what was stolen?

19:11.249 --> 19:13.843
That's the kicker.
Nothing.

19:13.985 --> 19:16.545
The curator, Dr. McElroy,
said the vault's been empty for weeks.

19:16.788 --> 19:18.221
Excuse me.
Detective?

19:20.825 --> 19:22.520
Okay, so, just connecting
the dots here.

19:22.760 --> 19:25.058
The Blade was likely put
in there when it first got here.

19:25.329 --> 19:28.162
The guards were
obviously demons, so...

19:28.332 --> 19:30.197
What? When the vault
turned out to be empty,

19:30.435 --> 19:32.395
they killed their guard meat-suits
and smoked out?

19:32.437 --> 19:34.234
And reported back to who?

19:34.405 --> 19:35.405
Abaddon?

19:38.075 --> 19:39.838
She's closing in.

19:47.652 --> 19:50.712
So, the First Blade
was never on display?

19:50.988 --> 19:53.957
No authenticated item by that name
was ever on these premises.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.649
"Authenticated."

19:55.860 --> 20:00.092
Dr. McElroy, this Blade was stolen
and smuggled into the US

20:00.331 --> 20:02.356
in violation of treaties
with several governments.

20:02.600 --> 20:04.864
We can compel you to speak.

20:06.237 --> 20:08.171
"Compel"?

20:08.339 --> 20:09.863
And what might that involve?

20:16.514 --> 20:20.211
All right, look, I did acquire
the so-called First Blade.

20:20.418 --> 20:23.216
And carbon dating did peg it
to biblical times,

20:23.454 --> 20:26.218
but the authentication
proved unreliable.

20:26.390 --> 20:27.584
So it was in the vault.

20:29.494 --> 20:30.756
I removed it myself.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.664
- The guards didn't know.
- And where is it now?

20:34.866 --> 20:39.200
Several weeks ago a confidential offer
was made to purchase it.

20:39.437 --> 20:41.769
I was afraid we would never
authenticate the thing, so...

20:41.939 --> 20:42.939
Who was the buyer?

20:44.041 --> 20:45.041
Sorry.

20:45.243 --> 20:47.370
The buyer insisted on absolute secrecy.

20:47.578 --> 20:49.443
Well...

20:49.680 --> 20:52.080
Federal statutes
trump your little deal.

20:52.316 --> 20:54.546
So, the buyer?

20:54.752 --> 20:58.711
And you'll get it out of me one way
or another, won't you, Agent?

21:05.763 --> 21:08.027
I never did know his real identity.

21:08.266 --> 21:10.063
He called himself "Magnus."

21:10.334 --> 21:12.495
Don't ask me where he lives.
I have no idea.

21:12.670 --> 21:15.161
But I do have a meeting.

21:15.406 --> 21:19.536
So, here is my number,
should you need anything else.

21:29.420 --> 21:30.420
What?

21:33.624 --> 21:36.024
Did you catch that?
"Magnus"?

21:36.193 --> 21:37.626
"Albert Magnus"?

21:37.862 --> 21:41.093
The name the Men of Letters used
when they want to be incognito?

21:41.299 --> 21:43.164
Yeah, but we know that all of
the Men of Letters are dead.

21:43.401 --> 21:45.392
Do we?

21:54.545 --> 21:56.035
Turndown service?

21:56.380 --> 21:57.540
I'd like a mint on my pillow.

21:57.682 --> 22:00.002
What do you know about
the Men of Letters massacre of 1958?

22:00.217 --> 22:02.742
We know Abaddon missed
our grandfather and Larry Ganem.

22:02.987 --> 22:04.045
Was there anybody else?

22:05.890 --> 22:07.289
Let me get this straight.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.560
You keep me locked up
in this closet,

22:09.794 --> 22:10.818
ignore my suffering,

22:11.062 --> 22:13.530
and then come barging in here
and demand my help?

22:15.099 --> 22:16.293
More or less, yeah.

22:18.603 --> 22:21.265
Did I or did I not keep my end
of the bargain the other night?

22:21.505 --> 22:23.939
Quite brilliantly, I might add.
We are partners!

22:24.175 --> 22:26.905
- And you owe me!
- "Owe" you?

22:27.144 --> 22:29.772
I wouldn't be in this mess
if it wasn't for you two.

22:29.947 --> 22:33.178
You shoot me up.
You make me a junkie.

22:33.384 --> 22:36.376
You keep me stashed away for months
while my kingdom falls apart!

22:40.324 --> 22:41.848
What do you want?

22:46.664 --> 22:48.655
It's not a very good scotch, is it?

22:50.735 --> 22:53.226
Okay, Crowley, we have gone
through the records

22:53.471 --> 22:55.439
for the entire membership
in 1958.

22:55.673 --> 22:59.131
Every single name matches
the men who were killed.

22:59.343 --> 23:01.243
That would be the active
membership, correct?

23:04.048 --> 23:05.948
Were you two dropped
on your heads a great deal?

23:06.183 --> 23:08.845
Like I told you, rumor has it

23:09.120 --> 23:11.748
that a rogue member
was tossed out on his ass.

23:11.956 --> 23:14.015
Does that make him "active"?

23:14.225 --> 23:17.160
Seriously, boys, how did you
ever function without me?

23:25.136 --> 23:27.730
Well, hello, Miss Ichigatsu.

23:29.707 --> 23:32.938
"Infamati et obliterati."

23:35.146 --> 23:38.343
"Dishonored and forgotten."

23:42.753 --> 23:43.981
Wow.

23:45.089 --> 23:46.522
This guy was something.

23:49.694 --> 23:51.855
- Tough name.
- Yeah, Cuthbert Sinclair.

23:53.230 --> 23:54.550
I'd have just gone with "Magnus."

23:54.632 --> 23:57.897
Looks like he designed most of the
warding that keeps the bunker safe.

23:58.135 --> 24:00.365
Says here he was named
"Master of Spell",

24:00.604 --> 24:01.730
right after he initiated.

24:01.972 --> 24:04.736
I guess his work got a little crazy.

24:04.942 --> 24:07.638
The leadership called it
"eccentric" and "irresponsible".

24:07.878 --> 24:10.005
Good. So these are the projects
that he proposed

24:10.281 --> 24:12.041
the last two years he was here.
Look at this.

24:12.183 --> 24:13.377
"Rejected."

24:13.584 --> 24:15.484
"Rejected."
"Rejected."

24:15.619 --> 24:16.745
So difficult.

24:16.987 --> 24:19.649
Brilliant, ahead of your time,
despised for it.

24:19.790 --> 24:21.519
Trust me, I know.

24:22.626 --> 24:26.585
"Formal separation
from Men of Letters, April 1956."

24:26.797 --> 24:28.424
He missed the massacre.

24:28.666 --> 24:33.228
I never knew his name,
but I heard someone was out.

24:33.404 --> 24:35.099
Did my damndest to find him.

24:35.306 --> 24:37.399
Thought he might be
my way inside this joint.

24:39.210 --> 24:40.871
So where'd you look?

24:54.825 --> 24:56.588
So this is where
your demons tracked him to?

24:58.229 --> 24:59.491
Exact spot.

25:00.831 --> 25:02.423
My boys never could find him.

25:04.034 --> 25:06.195
I'm sensing nothing,
so if he's here

25:06.437 --> 25:08.064
he's warded up to the gills.

25:08.305 --> 25:10.773
Well, he was a genius at it, right?

25:10.975 --> 25:13.671
Sure as hell ain't gonna be
found by a bunch of demons.

25:14.845 --> 25:16.972
Like he's gonna
open his heart to you lot,

25:17.281 --> 25:19.078
because you're such prizes?

25:19.283 --> 25:21.444
Better.
We're legacies.

25:26.090 --> 25:30.026
All right, if he's so bent on hiding,
maybe he's watching.

25:30.327 --> 25:31.851
Give it a shot.

25:34.865 --> 25:37.857
Cuthbert Sinclair.
Uh, Magnus, whatever.

25:40.004 --> 25:44.498
We're Sam and Dean Winchester,
Henry Winchester's grandsons.

25:44.708 --> 25:46.437
And Men of Letters, ourselves.

25:49.113 --> 25:51.377
We know what happened
back in the day.

25:51.582 --> 25:55.541
We don't necessarily agree with it.

25:55.719 --> 25:57.482
We figured...

25:57.688 --> 26:00.782
Maybe you want to tell
your side of the story.

26:28.152 --> 26:30.112
♪ Which way?

27:02.319 --> 27:03.547
Bravo!

27:03.821 --> 27:05.288
Well done.

27:08.425 --> 27:11.360
Sorry about all the theatricality.

27:11.562 --> 27:13.189
I just wanted to see
what you two were made of.

27:13.364 --> 27:16.162
So, what, are we underground?

27:16.400 --> 27:17.400
No.

27:17.601 --> 27:20.161
No, my fortress is right where
you were standing.

27:20.304 --> 27:22.033
But it's invisible.

27:23.474 --> 27:25.169
Then you must be Cuthbert Sinclair.

27:27.144 --> 27:30.375
I haven't gone by
that moniker in, oh...

27:30.581 --> 27:31.605
57 years now.

27:31.782 --> 27:34.307
Well, you're looking good
for a guy pushing... 90?

27:34.551 --> 27:36.041
Well, thanks, sport.

27:36.253 --> 27:38.448
There's a spell
for damn near everything.

27:38.689 --> 27:39.689
I am impressed, though.

27:39.890 --> 27:42.154
You did exactly
what you should've done.

27:42.326 --> 27:44.794
Though I am gonna miss
those two from my zoo.

27:45.863 --> 27:46.863
Your zoo?

27:48.365 --> 27:52.392
Gentlemen, you are in the midst
of the greatest collection

27:52.636 --> 27:55.935
of supernatural rarities
and antiquities on the planet.

27:56.173 --> 27:57.173
I'm sorry.

27:57.374 --> 27:59.604
Did you say
that you were Men of Letters?

27:59.777 --> 28:02.109
I thought that whole thing
died out after '58.

28:02.346 --> 28:04.473
Well, we are...
We are legacies.

28:04.715 --> 28:07.047
But actually...

28:07.184 --> 28:08.184
We're hunters.

28:09.286 --> 28:11.846
Hunters?

28:12.022 --> 28:14.547
Ha ha! Wow!

28:14.725 --> 28:15.487
Hunters.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.285
With the key to the kingdom!

28:17.528 --> 28:19.621
The boys must be spinning
in their graves.

28:19.797 --> 28:21.230
Damn snobs.

28:21.432 --> 28:23.195
Bunch of librarians,
if you ask me.

28:23.467 --> 28:26.027
Although I was always fond of Henry.

28:26.236 --> 28:28.466
I was his mentor, you know?

28:28.672 --> 28:31.869
Yeah, till the squares
gave me the boot.

28:32.042 --> 28:33.042
Yeah.

28:33.210 --> 28:35.940
'Course, he came here
to visit me, in secret.

28:36.146 --> 28:37.909
Called out to me, same as you did.

28:38.148 --> 28:39.148
Oh, yes.

28:39.149 --> 28:42.175
Quite the wild hair,
your grandfather was.

28:43.821 --> 28:46.085
Listen, Magnus.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.815
We got ourselves a little situation.

28:48.993 --> 28:51.928
Abaddon,
the last knight of Hell,

28:52.096 --> 28:54.564
is looking to up her pay grade
and take over the place.

28:54.732 --> 28:57.326
Things never change, do they?

28:57.534 --> 29:00.196
I kept telling the boys
over and over again.

29:00.437 --> 29:03.133
I would say,
"We could stop all this.

29:03.374 --> 29:05.374
We could rid the world of monsters
once and for all

29:05.609 --> 29:06.974
if we just put our minds to it."

29:07.211 --> 29:08.211
But, "oh, no," they said.

29:08.412 --> 29:10.277
"No, no, no.
It's not our place.

29:10.481 --> 29:11.914
We're here to study.
We're here to catalog."

29:12.116 --> 29:15.017
Yeah, yeah, no, we get it.
They're, geeks.

29:16.253 --> 29:17.720
But she can be stopped.

29:19.056 --> 29:21.991
But we need something
that we hear you have.

29:22.159 --> 29:23.159
The First Blade.

29:29.166 --> 29:31.225
Hm. I see.

29:31.435 --> 29:34.029
Interesting.

29:34.238 --> 29:36.798
But if you'd really done
your homework, you would know that

29:36.974 --> 29:38.236
it's absolutely useless,

29:38.475 --> 29:40.355
unless, of course,
you're possessing the Mark...

29:40.377 --> 29:42.106
The Mark of Cain.

29:46.583 --> 29:48.949
Oh, my.

29:49.153 --> 29:50.984
How did you come by that?

29:51.188 --> 29:53.383
Listen, if Abaddon takes over,

29:53.557 --> 29:56.151
the one thing she wants
more than anything

29:56.326 --> 29:57.326
is to make hell on Earth.

29:57.528 --> 29:59.428
Not even you can escape that.

30:01.098 --> 30:03.362
And they say
all hunters are morons.

30:05.035 --> 30:06.935
It's right there behind you,
gentlemen.

30:13.677 --> 30:15.907
Listen, if you're serious
about taking action, this...

30:16.146 --> 30:17.773
This is taking action.

30:17.948 --> 30:20.280
You loan us that Blade,
and we will stop the bitch.

30:21.552 --> 30:22.314
Hm...

30:22.453 --> 30:24.080
Let me think about it.

30:24.254 --> 30:26.154
All right,
I've thought about it.

30:46.009 --> 30:47.203
Magnus has Dean.

30:47.411 --> 30:48.742
What did you do with my brother?

30:48.979 --> 30:51.140
Don't worry.
He's fine.

30:51.281 --> 30:53.374
But I did what any
good collector would do.

30:53.650 --> 30:56.744
I separated the ordinary
from the extraordinary.

30:56.954 --> 30:58.615
I had the First Blade.

30:58.856 --> 31:01.689
And now I have the Mark of Cain
to complete the set.

31:01.925 --> 31:04.120
Yeah, well, problem is,
it's attached.

31:04.361 --> 31:06.556
So how about you loan me the Blade
and I take care of business?

31:06.763 --> 31:09.596
Dean, I am offering you
the moon here.

31:09.766 --> 31:12.633
To be part of the greatest collection
of all time,

31:12.870 --> 31:15.566
to be young forever.

31:17.407 --> 31:19.875
Let me teach you my secrets. Hm?

31:20.077 --> 31:21.772
Be my companion.

31:21.912 --> 31:26.872
I have to be honest with you,
it has gotten lonely here over the years.

31:27.084 --> 31:30.019
When you were saying any of that,
did it feel at all creepy?

31:31.788 --> 31:34.154
Yeah. I'm just gonna
grab the Blade and go.

31:34.358 --> 31:36.485
One little design flaw to the place.

31:36.727 --> 31:38.092
No windows, no doors.

31:41.665 --> 31:43.792
Well, in that case...

31:44.001 --> 31:45.593
I'll just make my own.

31:45.802 --> 31:47.133
Hey.

31:47.337 --> 31:49.032
- Ah!
- Huh?

31:49.206 --> 31:50.264
Tricky little spell,
that first one, right?

31:50.474 --> 31:52.135
Chinese.

31:52.309 --> 31:54.140
Cheap magician's trick on that one.

31:54.278 --> 31:55.278
Picked your pocket.

31:55.445 --> 31:57.470
Nice gun.

31:58.882 --> 32:00.349
Welcome to the collection, Dean.

32:12.462 --> 32:13.690
You mind?

32:16.700 --> 32:18.725
Who would have thunk it, eh, Moose?

32:18.902 --> 32:22.303
You and me, same team,
in the trenches.

32:22.506 --> 32:24.133
When this is over,
we can get matching tattoos.

32:24.341 --> 32:28.607
Just to be clear, Crowley,
we are not on the same anything.

32:29.546 --> 32:32.014
By the way,
since the place is warded,

32:32.249 --> 32:35.150
your powers are useless,
which means you are useless,

32:35.352 --> 32:36.376
even more so than usual.

32:37.521 --> 32:40.149
You're gonna need another
set of hands when you get in there,

32:40.390 --> 32:42.984
unless you have
other volunteers in mind.

32:44.161 --> 32:45.924
Thanks. Pass.

32:47.231 --> 32:48.596
If memory serves me,

32:49.433 --> 32:51.867
I'm the one
who helped your brother

32:52.102 --> 32:54.969
find Cain so that we could
find the Blade,

32:55.239 --> 32:58.299
so that Dean
could receive the Mark.

32:58.675 --> 33:03.977
I'm the one who flushed that lout,
Gadreel, out of your noggin.

33:04.181 --> 33:08.777
So, lately, big boy,
I've seen more playing time than you.

33:09.019 --> 33:12.785
Crowley, will you please
shut the hell up?

33:16.493 --> 33:19.121
You're a really sorry
piece of work. You know that?

33:19.997 --> 33:21.362
Holed up in here, doing nothing.

33:21.865 --> 33:24.095
You bitch
about the Men of Letters.

33:24.268 --> 33:25.701
You're way worse.

33:27.871 --> 33:30.032
Should we fire it up?
What do you say?

33:30.207 --> 33:31.469
Go to hell.

33:31.708 --> 33:32.766
Come on, Dean.

33:33.010 --> 33:35.205
This is the object of your quest.

33:35.646 --> 33:37.238
Tell me

33:37.481 --> 33:41.440
Henry Winchester's grandson
isn't curious to see if it works.

33:43.186 --> 33:44.778
Give me your hand.

33:45.389 --> 33:47.152
Give me

33:47.391 --> 33:48.483
your hand.

33:49.393 --> 33:50.621
That's it.

34:08.812 --> 34:09.938
Good.

34:14.016 --> 34:16.485
Next time, it'll be easier.

34:17.120 --> 34:20.681
You'll get used to the feelings,
even welcome them.

34:23.793 --> 34:24.793
Here's something.

34:25.062 --> 34:27.326
Apparently,
he wanted to make the entire

34:27.563 --> 34:29.088
Men of Letters bunker invisible.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.460
All physical points of entry
were to be eliminated,

34:31.702 --> 34:34.068
"and entrance
would only be gained...

34:35.405 --> 34:36.702
...by spell."

34:38.608 --> 34:39.608
Ooh.

34:40.811 --> 34:42.277
We're gonna need some things.

34:42.646 --> 34:44.606
You actually might turn out
to be useful, Crowley.

34:44.815 --> 34:48.581
You'll come to understand,
Dean, nothing can stop us.

34:48.819 --> 34:54.348
Anything, anyone we want
to own or destroy is ours.

34:56.126 --> 34:57.753
Well how about this, Magnus?

34:58.962 --> 35:00.520
How about I take a knee?

35:01.965 --> 35:03.045
Then what are you gonna do?

35:03.166 --> 35:04.394
Huh?
You gonna kill me?

35:05.402 --> 35:07.199
'Cause without this thing
on my arm

35:07.471 --> 35:10.235
that Blade's nothing
but a hunk of bone with teeth.

35:10.907 --> 35:12.033
Hm.

35:12.242 --> 35:15.734
Well, I'm not asking you
for your cooperation.

35:16.580 --> 35:17.808
I'm just taking it.

35:28.392 --> 35:30.087
Interesting effect, huh?

35:30.293 --> 35:32.853
All thought, all will just...

35:33.096 --> 35:34.427
Drained out of you.

35:34.598 --> 35:36.759
I do this enough,

35:36.967 --> 35:39.629
you'll be ready
for whatever I have in mind.

35:46.143 --> 35:47.440
I did good, eh, Moose?

35:47.677 --> 35:49.577
Everything on the list.

35:53.917 --> 35:54.941
You're welcome.

35:57.587 --> 36:01.182
Remember,
stay close, do what I say,

36:01.425 --> 36:02.687
and shut the hell up.

36:02.926 --> 36:04.553
I'm growing on you, aren't I?

36:28.452 --> 36:30.784
Love what he's done
with the place.

36:59.816 --> 37:01.511
Take me to my brother.

37:04.621 --> 37:06.521
Sam! No!

37:18.535 --> 37:20.230
Shape-shifter.

37:20.403 --> 37:23.338
You see?
There are benefits to keeping a zoo.

37:34.251 --> 37:38.551
You know, I discarded you
far too quickly, Sam.

37:38.788 --> 37:40.708
You're way more valuable
than I thought you were.

37:40.857 --> 37:44.224
Why would I knock myself out
trying to sap your will?

37:44.461 --> 37:48.158
I think Sam here will get you
to see things my way.

37:48.365 --> 37:49.627
Magnus, I swear to God...

37:49.866 --> 37:50.866
What?

37:51.101 --> 37:52.781
What are you gonna do?
What is he gonna do?

37:52.802 --> 37:53.802
Huh?

37:58.041 --> 38:00.601
Yeah, look, look, Sam,
I'm not gonna kill you.

38:00.844 --> 38:02.175
Of course not.

38:02.379 --> 38:06.145
But I am gonna make you suffer
unimaginably, all right?

38:26.870 --> 38:28.303
Dean?

38:36.646 --> 38:38.079
Dean.

38:41.885 --> 38:43.375
Hey, it's over.

38:44.588 --> 38:46.180
He's dead.

38:47.624 --> 38:49.114
Drop the Blade, Dean.

38:54.264 --> 38:56.027
Dean!

38:59.102 --> 39:00.330
Drop the Blade.

39:15.385 --> 39:17.444
Brilliant, I must say.

39:17.687 --> 39:19.047
I'm speaking of myself, of course.

39:19.189 --> 39:21.749
All you two managed
to do was get trussed up.

39:21.958 --> 39:24.449
Combine a little derring-do
on my part,

39:24.728 --> 39:26.628
a little dumb muscle
from Squirrel,

39:26.863 --> 39:28.660
a little bleeding from Moose...

39:29.399 --> 39:31.299
Happy ending.
Roll credits.

39:31.534 --> 39:32.865
No, no!

39:33.136 --> 39:34.160
Come on.

39:34.404 --> 39:35.666
What the hell?

39:35.872 --> 39:37.863
That's sulfur.
Demons.

39:37.974 --> 39:39.271
Ah!

39:39.442 --> 39:41.034
Abaddon's.

39:41.177 --> 39:43.077
Well, she's just one jump behind us.

39:43.313 --> 39:44.803
Guess she couldn't find
Magnus' joint, either.

39:45.048 --> 39:46.777
- What about the trunk?
- Safe.

39:46.983 --> 39:48.280
Warding kept them out.

39:50.420 --> 39:52.115
Demon mitts all over my baby.

39:52.322 --> 39:53.846
Come on!

39:55.458 --> 39:57.153
Now they're keying cars?

40:00.897 --> 40:02.762
What language is that?

40:02.966 --> 40:03.966
It's Enochian.

40:04.034 --> 40:06.366
The message isn't for you.

40:06.569 --> 40:07.695
It's for me.

40:09.139 --> 40:11.164
"Be afraid. Your Queen."

40:11.374 --> 40:13.205
Abaddon's getting more brazen.

40:13.476 --> 40:14.738
She thinks I'm losing my grip.

40:19.149 --> 40:20.149
Dean.

40:21.584 --> 40:22.710
Dean.

40:24.354 --> 40:29.451
Listen, you said Crowley was
only useful till we got the Blade.

40:29.659 --> 40:31.524
We got the Blade.

40:40.236 --> 40:43.467
You know, boys,
I'm in debt to you.

40:43.673 --> 40:45.300
You forced sobriety on me,

40:45.508 --> 40:49.444
and now I can see the situation
for what it is.

40:49.579 --> 40:52.070
Dean, you are quite the killing machine.

40:52.315 --> 40:55.682
And it occurs to me that Abaddon
is not the only name on your list.

40:55.885 --> 40:59.013
My name must be up there, as well.

41:06.329 --> 41:07.626
It's no good to you without me.

41:09.032 --> 41:12.365
Yes, but as long as I have it,
it's no good to you.

41:12.602 --> 41:14.297
Now, this is the way
it's going to go.

41:14.537 --> 41:16.004
I'll hang on
to old donkey teeth here

41:16.239 --> 41:18.799
until such time
as you locate Abaddon.

41:18.942 --> 41:22.844
Then you'll destroy her.

41:24.114 --> 41:25.547
You're right, Moose.

41:25.815 --> 41:26.975
You can't trust me.

41:27.217 --> 41:30.675
But sadly,
I can't trust you, either.
