01:16.880 --> 01:19.952
Oh, baby, that's so good.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.754
I never knew it could be like this.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.030
- Al.
- Peg.

01:25.240 --> 01:27.117
- Al.
- Peg.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.958
Al.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.071
Peg, shut up, will you?

01:31.280 --> 01:33.157
I'm trying to sleep.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.231
Oh, Al, I had
the most wonderful dream.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.755
We were having sex.

01:40.960 --> 01:42.439
Actually, I shouldn't say "we. "

01:42.640 --> 01:44.437
You weren't there.

01:44.920 --> 01:47.559
Oh, yeah?
Then why were you calling, "Al"?

01:47.800 --> 01:50.394
I wanted you
to see how it was done.

01:54.040 --> 01:57.077
Mommy, I can't sleep.
Read me a story.

01:57.480 --> 01:59.789
Hop on in. Come on, honey.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.434
Good boy. There we go.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.870
Peg, where am I supposed to sleep?

02:05.080 --> 02:08.356
You know, this is why I always said
we should have a stable.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.311
That would be like an invitation
for your mother to come stay with us.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.919
You know, a place with straw...

02:14.120 --> 02:16.793
...and a nice gate
she can rest her breasts on.

02:18.480 --> 02:22.758
Well, I guess I'll have to go
to the only place I can truly call home.

02:31.640 --> 02:33.835
Honey, you just make yourself
nice and snugly...

02:34.040 --> 02:36.315
...and Mommy's gonna
find you a story.

02:37.960 --> 02:41.270
Oh, well, I can't read you that.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.639
Oh, I've been looking for this.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.991
How did that get in there?

02:48.720 --> 02:51.029
Oh, here's something.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.470
How about a nice pirate story?

02:53.680 --> 02:56.956
<i>It's very exciting.
A Ship Called Passion.</i>

02:57.160 --> 02:59.674
Does it have a lot of
action and stuff?

02:59.880 --> 03:02.792
Oh, yes, it does.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.197
As a matter of fact, I was reading it
before I went to bed...

03:06.400 --> 03:09.597
...and I had a very nice sleep.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.473
Now, let's see here. Okay.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.716
"The beautiful Princess Scarlet...

03:14.920 --> 03:16.672
...looked o'er the bounding main...

03:16.880 --> 03:20.429
...as she sailed from her father's
realm to meet her betrothed...

03:20.640 --> 03:22.790
...Prince Paco the Magnificent...

03:23.000 --> 03:24.797
...for the very first time.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.470
The blue waves
lapped gently against the shore-"

03:36.760 --> 03:38.557
A little problem, Peg.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.555
This is a job for old Betsy.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.189
Why do all plungers
have girls' names, Al?

03:53.440 --> 03:56.113
Because the caveman used to hold
their women by the feet...

03:56.320 --> 03:57.958
...for a job like this.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.750
All right. Now, where were we?

04:01.960 --> 04:04.315
"As day broke over Madagascar...

04:04.520 --> 04:06.795
...so did the heart
of Princess Scarlet...

04:07.000 --> 04:12.028
...for her ship was taken
by the vile pirate, Captain Courage. "

04:17.640 --> 04:20.029
<i>The v oluptuous vixen
was a prisoner...</i>

04:20.240 --> 04:22.834
<i>...not of love, but of evil.</i>

04:23.040 --> 04:25.838
<i>If only they were better-looking.</i>

04:26.480 --> 04:29.074
Unhand me,
you ruthless rapscallions.

04:29.280 --> 04:30.838
You'll pay dearly for this.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.998
My betrothed,
Prince Paco the Magnificent...

04:34.200 --> 04:36.839
...will have your
social-disease-ridden hides.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.508
Now, where is your captain,
that I may spit in his eye?

04:39.720 --> 04:42.393
<i>Where he goes
after every great conquest:</i>

04:42.600 --> 04:45.797
To be alone
to work on the captain's log.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.195
It is I, Captain Courage.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.756
I had to swing in
because it's wet back there.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.355
Where is the cabin boy?

05:15.280 --> 05:16.713
How may I serve you, sir?

05:16.960 --> 05:18.871
You can swab the deck
in my quarters...

05:19.080 --> 05:21.958
...ye of cropped hair
and dubious sexuality.

05:23.160 --> 05:26.391
Aye, aye, sir.
But I seem to have lost my mop.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.592
May I use your nose hairs
as bristles?

05:31.200 --> 05:34.192
Mock me if you will,
oh, cabin boy-girl.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.913
Now, go, before I make you
walk the plank.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.192
Or should I say, walk yourself?

05:42.560 --> 05:45.757
I sense you are threatened
by my androgyny.

05:45.960 --> 05:49.475
Perhaps it is that encounter that you
had with your strange uncle pirate...

05:49.680 --> 05:50.908
...that haunteth you.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.710
I am not gay.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.631
Any man can
live with his mother till he's 40.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.553
Captain...

06:02.760 --> 06:05.911
...the men would like
a shot at Big Red.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.628
Please, no.

06:09.560 --> 06:11.198
Not now, Wilbur.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.949
Methinks that Scarlet will bring
a bigger ransom as a virgin.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.993
But these wenches are fair game.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.670
And as usual, the first choice
goes to my first mate...

06:24.880 --> 06:27.075
...Floovio the Handsome.
Ho, Floovio.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.676
Hello, me pretties.

06:35.200 --> 06:40.274
It's time to partake of a hot flagon
of Floovio. You there.

06:41.160 --> 06:45.392
How would you like to play a game
of Hide the Hooters with Floovio?

06:47.720 --> 06:49.073
Come, wenches.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.669
Kiss me or kiss the sharks.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.509
Floovio, how many times do I have
to tell you? Don't give them a choice.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.473
Let us flee these waters...

07:10.680 --> 07:13.911
...infested by my mortal enemy,
Rubio the Cruel.

07:14.160 --> 07:15.912
We'll sail for our hideaway...

07:16.120 --> 07:19.476
...where girls do our wishes
for bags filled with fishes.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.151
Where is the ship's navigator?

07:23.880 --> 07:25.199
Here, Captain Daddy.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.590
I was playing fetch
with Long John Buck...

07:32.800 --> 07:34.631
...and I forgot we were at sea.

07:40.560 --> 07:44.155
Navigator, we're sailing
to our hideout. Do your job.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.595
Okey-dokey, Captain Daddy.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.597
Now, in case of an emergency,
please use the exits clearly marked...

07:50.800 --> 07:53.473
...on the port and starboard
sides of the ship.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.557
And in case of a water landing...

07:55.760 --> 07:58.035
...Floovio has many
delightful flotation devices...

07:58.240 --> 08:00.196
...already blown up in his cabin.

08:03.280 --> 08:07.796
But please, don't grab their chests,
for the plastic is wearing thin.

08:11.640 --> 08:15.758
<i>Scarlet felt despair
creep over her body lik e the fog...</i>

08:15.960 --> 08:18.190
<i>...or was that Black Bob?</i>

08:20.560 --> 08:22.471
" Either way, she held firm...

08:22.680 --> 08:25.831
...saving her purity
for Paco the Magnificent. "

08:26.960 --> 08:28.996
It's worse than I thought in there.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.512
It got old Betsy.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.674
This is a job
for old Betsy's mother...

08:42.080 --> 08:43.957
...real old Betsy.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.317
I'm going in.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.550
This time, it's personal.

08:59.160 --> 09:00.878
Okay.

09:01.080 --> 09:05.790
" Later that day, as the welcoming sun
caressed the curvaceous princess...

09:06.000 --> 09:09.549
...she found herself alone
with Captain Courage. "

09:09.760 --> 09:12.718
<i>I wanted to hate that man
and his rascal ways...</i>

09:12.920 --> 09:15.798
<i>...but after a while,
I discovered something about him.:</i>

09:16.000 --> 09:20.755
<i>A zest for life, a je ne sais quoi
that was hard to resist.</i>

09:32.720 --> 09:36.349
<i>The days became endless
and I became dizzy with wonder.</i>

09:36.560 --> 09:37.788
<i>Where was I?</i>

09:38.000 --> 09:40.594
<i>Where was Prince Paco,
my fearless rescuer?</i>

09:41.040 --> 09:44.510
<i>Where was the Domino's Pizza ship?</i>

09:44.720 --> 09:48.076
<i>Thirty days or less, my ass.</i>

09:54.480 --> 09:56.391
<i>My senses were reeling.</i>

09:56.600 --> 10:00.309
<i>On the ship of madness,
I yearned for a v oice of reason.</i>

10:00.560 --> 10:02.391
Land ho!

10:02.760 --> 10:04.159
Funny-looking land.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.636
Made of wood, sails, oars.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.513
Oh, and a big steering thing,
just like us.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.756
My goof. It was a ship.

10:18.640 --> 10:22.269
<i>Then, as I look ed up,
something golden struck my eye.</i>

10:22.480 --> 10:23.959
<i>I thought it was the sun...</i>

10:24.160 --> 10:28.073
<i>...but it was the golden mane
of Prince Paco the Magnificent.</i>

10:38.360 --> 10:40.351
Damn wind.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.990
You there, find the dastardly
Captain Courage...

10:51.200 --> 10:54.829
...and bring him here that he might pay
for abducting my bride-to-be...

10:55.040 --> 10:58.077
...and causing me this uneven tan.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.991
<i>Though he did not know who I was...</i>

11:01.200 --> 11:03.191
<i>...he was drawn to me lik e magic.</i>

11:05.640 --> 11:10.634
By your fiery hair
and your bodacious frame...

11:10.840 --> 11:15.072
...you could be the only one
to tell me where my fair Scarlet is.

11:15.760 --> 11:19.833
'Tis I,
you hunka hunka burning hair.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.716
I am your fair Scarlet.

11:23.320 --> 11:27.757
Well, I guess I could handle you.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.798
Many have died trying.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.355
That's why I'm still a virgin.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.676
But let's give it a go.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.192
Watch it, now.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.868
How dare you disturb me
while I was perusing my copy...

11:42.080 --> 11:44.469
<i>...of Seagoing C-Cups.</i>

11:45.080 --> 11:48.436
<i>Prince Paco, sir, may I remind you
you have a 3:00 at the beauty parlour.</i>

11:48.640 --> 11:50.278
Set sail!

11:50.480 --> 11:52.550
We are deep in the waters
of Rubio the Cruel...

11:52.760 --> 11:55.513
...who would stop at nothing
to cop our precious cargo.

11:56.320 --> 11:59.995
And soon...
Soon we shall kill this Philistine...

12:00.200 --> 12:02.236
...in a manner
befitting the way he lives.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.556
Nothing will bother me as long as you
do not take me away from the sea...

12:06.760 --> 12:08.990
...and saddle me with a wife
that doth not work...

12:09.200 --> 12:11.395
...and kids that whilst not
leave the ship.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.272
How about we cut off your head
and feed it to the maggots?

12:16.200 --> 12:17.633
Better.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.517
<i>With the dangerous Captain Courage
tied to the mast...</i>

12:29.720 --> 12:31.551
<i>...and Paco by my side...</i>

12:31.760 --> 12:35.116
<i>...the threat of Rubio the Cruel
seemed far away.</i>

12:35.320 --> 12:37.515
<i>My prince bared his soul to me.</i>

12:37.720 --> 12:41.554
<i>He could talk for hours
about his deepest passions.</i>

12:41.760 --> 12:43.796
I'm a natural blond.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.912
It's really healthy. No split ends.

12:49.720 --> 12:53.554
All it takes is a hundred strokes
a day. That's the ticket.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.432
One, two...

12:55.640 --> 12:58.279
<i>What woman
wouldn't want this man?</i>

12:58.520 --> 13:01.353
<i>But if he was truly
the man of my dreams...</i>

13:01.560 --> 13:03.710
<i>...why was I haunted by memories...</i>

13:03.920 --> 13:07.629
<i>...of my days and nights
of Captain Courage?</i>

13:36.920 --> 13:40.435
<i>But still, I was promised
to Prince Paco.</i>

13:40.640 --> 13:42.232
<i>I couldn't break his heart.</i>

13:42.440 --> 13:45.034
<i>It was obvious he loved me so.</i>

13:50.160 --> 13:51.991
Hey, Floovio.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.630
Boy, I sure would like some of that.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.472
What is it?

13:59.600 --> 14:02.273
It is the cabin boy-girl, sir.

14:02.840 --> 14:06.753
Oh, I am smitten
by that boyish kitten.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.155
Ahoy, cabin boy.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.989
I am strangely attracted to you
and your dubious sexuality.

14:14.440 --> 14:18.479
And I to you and your easy,
pretty-boy manner.

14:18.680 --> 14:22.514
So let me remove all doubt
and prove to you that I'm no boy.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.553
How?

14:43.960 --> 14:46.520
Look closer, you idiot!

14:51.400 --> 14:52.992
Land ho!

14:58.040 --> 15:00.554
I hope this doesn't
come out of my paycheck.

15:00.960 --> 15:03.554
<i>It was him, the demon of the seas...</i>

15:03.760 --> 15:05.034
<i>...the dagger of deceit...</i>

15:05.240 --> 15:08.038
<i>...the hardest-working pirate
in show business...</i>

15:08.240 --> 15:10.231
<i>...Rubio the Cruel.</i>

15:25.000 --> 15:28.549
Ahoy, me mates.
It is I, Rubio the Cruel.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.835
But enough good cheer.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.710
Men, hide your women.
Women, hide your heinies.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.354
For I'll bring you the unique
musical styling...

15:43.560 --> 15:45.676
...of Rubio the Cruel.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.074
Rubettes!

16:27.400 --> 16:30.710
Now we all know
why he's called Rubio the Cruel.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.074
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

16:43.280 --> 16:45.077
You've been a wonderful audience...

16:45.280 --> 16:48.716
...but now it's time to kill some people
and marry the princess.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.115
Any objections,
you seagoing weenie?

16:53.640 --> 16:56.108
Kill him, Paco. Rip his guts out.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.595
Show him what I mean to you, baby.

16:58.800 --> 17:02.395
I would, but I'm wearing
my good clothes.

17:02.600 --> 17:07.674
Besides, I am
strangely attracted to this.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.678
This girl. This girl.

17:10.880 --> 17:12.871
Who wants to see?

17:15.440 --> 17:17.476
Prepare my virgin.

17:27.760 --> 17:30.354
Not that one.
I haven't been at sea that long.

17:31.560 --> 17:35.189
I meant the red goddess.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.879
You're not taking me anywhere.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.036
I'm not gonna
spend one moment with you.

17:39.240 --> 17:42.312
Not with that voice
and that limited repertoire.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.073
Who's next?

18:25.720 --> 18:29.156
Now, nothing will stop me from
marrying you, collecting your dowry...

18:29.360 --> 18:31.510
...having my way with you
and killing you.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.029
Not necessarily in that order.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.791
<i>Can this be my fate?</i>

18:38.000 --> 18:42.516
<i>Married to a man who would butcher
both me and Gilbert and Sullivan?</i>

18:43.400 --> 18:45.960
<i>Only one could save me...</i>

18:46.160 --> 18:47.912
<i>...but he wasn't here.</i>

18:48.560 --> 18:52.269
Captain, save me,
and I will be your woman.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.870
The sea and my girlie magazines
are my woman.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.479
Yes, but can the sea
and your magazines...

18:59.680 --> 19:01.272
...cook and clean for you?

19:01.480 --> 19:04.517
I will. I just love that stuff.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.039
Yeah?

19:06.240 --> 19:07.958
And are you really a virgin?

19:08.160 --> 19:11.550
As sure as I love cooking
and cleaning.

19:13.560 --> 19:15.516
Well, what about kids?
I don't want no kids.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.392
You don't have to worry about that.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.477
I'll be too busy earning us a living...

19:19.680 --> 19:22.513
...and bringing you kegs of ale
to have children.

19:22.720 --> 19:25.598
Scarlet, you is my woman.

19:26.200 --> 19:29.078
I can't break these chains.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.157
Cabin boy-girl, come.

19:31.360 --> 19:32.793
Show him your bosoms.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.433
<i>Verily, your flatness saved the day.</i>

19:46.080 --> 19:48.389
Floovio, my blade.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.032
Cruel, hold on now.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.233
If you want this woman,
you must go through me.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.637
Let's rock.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.391
You're making me look bad
in front of my woman.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.877
At least she doesn't have to
look at the bits of corn in your teeth.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.954
That corn is my teeth.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.393
For that, you die.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.034
You fool.

21:28.240 --> 21:31.755
I was taught to fight by the greatest
teachers in the finest schools.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.315
Yeah? Well, I was taught how to fight
in the street.

21:50.520 --> 21:53.830
<i>And Princess Scarlet
lived happily ever after.</i>

21:54.640 --> 21:58.872
<i>He, on the other hand,
was not interesting ever again.</i>

22:02.160 --> 22:04.230
Get up, honey. Now go to bed.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.919
Good boy. Go on.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.315
Take me, Captain Courage!

22:12.520 --> 22:13.748
Who?

22:13.960 --> 22:15.632
Why?

22:15.840 --> 22:18.149
Peg, no!

22:19.305 --> 22:25.525
