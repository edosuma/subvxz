WEBVTT

00:00.619 --> 00:02.686
<i>You're out, Mickey...
out of business.</i>

00:02.719 --> 00:03.719
Chalky White's taking over.

00:03.754 --> 00:05.320
What am I supposed
to tell my partners?

00:05.355 --> 00:07.755
<i>- He drives a packard you said.
- But it wasn't Chalky.</i>

00:07.790 --> 00:09.256
You hung a fella
that works for him.

00:09.290 --> 00:12.124
- What do you say, Mr. White?
- You tell Nucky Thompson

00:12.158 --> 00:15.893
it's gonna take a lot more than 10
grand to get me to fuck him over.

00:15.927 --> 00:18.361
I want to introduce you
to someone. Odette!

00:18.396 --> 00:20.629
<i>This is Richard Harrow.</i>

00:20.664 --> 00:22.230
Come on, baby.

00:22.265 --> 00:24.598
It was an oversight,
that's all.

00:24.632 --> 00:26.666
You watch the door.

00:26.700 --> 00:28.600
You drive my car.

00:28.635 --> 00:30.201
Don't move!

00:32.070 --> 00:33.703
You're sure these are
the guys who held you up?

00:33.737 --> 00:36.170
- Absolutely.
- The D'Alessio brothers.

00:36.205 --> 00:38.772
- What do you want me to do?
- You need me to spell it out?

00:38.807 --> 00:41.507
- Kill them?
- Yes.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.308
Hello?

00:44.342 --> 00:45.876
Jimmy, my God.

00:45.910 --> 00:48.144
It was nice
to see you, old boy.

00:48.179 --> 00:51.113
Supervisor Elliot... He
thinks we're being obsessive

00:51.147 --> 00:54.048
<i>- about the hans Schroeder case.
- We have a witness</i>

00:54.082 --> 00:56.249
that can place Darmody
at the scene of the murders.

00:56.283 --> 00:59.085
Mayor Bacharach...
He's weak and losing ground.

00:59.119 --> 01:01.520
Run somebody else for Mayor.

01:01.554 --> 01:04.822
- Mayor Edward Bader.
- I'll be in touch.

01:04.857 --> 01:08.360
D'Alessios... They're being
backed by Rothstein and Luciano.

01:08.394 --> 01:11.763
- Can you bail me out?
- The legal system's not your ticket to freedom.

01:13.298 --> 01:16.466
I wish there was
a way I could help.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.402
You can help us get
the women's vote.

01:18.436 --> 01:21.638
Shouldn't you wait until the
amendment actually passes?

01:21.672 --> 01:23.238
<i>I'm an eternal optimist.</i>

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:42.793 --> 03:44.427
Oh. Oh.

03:44.462 --> 03:46.262
Oh, I'm sorry.

03:46.297 --> 03:48.198
Don't mind.
Don't be afraid.

03:48.232 --> 03:50.801
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

03:50.835 --> 03:52.702
I won't hurt you.

03:52.736 --> 03:56.939
Mama!

04:00.376 --> 04:01.977
Shh.

04:02.011 --> 04:04.380
We're on edge here as it is.

04:04.414 --> 04:07.149
I'm sorry.

04:07.183 --> 04:09.817
It's not comfortable
to sleep with.

04:11.853 --> 04:15.055
<i>- Mama.
- Shh.</i>

04:21.596 --> 04:23.697
I'm sorry.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.003
He said he had to make water

04:30.037 --> 04:32.472
and if I didn't pull over,
he'd do it right there

04:32.507 --> 04:34.808
in his trousers
on the car seat.

04:34.843 --> 04:36.610
You should have let him.

04:36.645 --> 04:38.112
Nelson.

04:38.146 --> 04:39.680
I had to go myself, sir.

04:39.714 --> 04:41.983
It's almost four hours'
drive to Manhattan.

04:42.017 --> 04:45.620
I'd had several cups of coffee.

04:45.654 --> 04:48.622
I stopped the car,
relieved myself,

04:48.657 --> 04:51.325
then unlocked
winslow's handcuffs.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.795
In other words, you
dispensed with protocol.

04:53.829 --> 04:55.663
To not do so would have meant

04:55.697 --> 04:57.832
unbuttoning his trousers and...

04:57.866 --> 05:00.534
and touching his Johnson
with your fingers.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.035
Yes sir.

05:02.070 --> 05:04.304
So in service
to your own modesty,

05:04.339 --> 05:06.473
you ended up
killing our witness.

05:06.507 --> 05:09.475
You will not be
told again, Nelson.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.044
Nothing in his demeanor

05:12.079 --> 05:14.213
led me to believe
that he'd attack me, sir.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.882
The man was a felon.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.755
You got anything else to say?

05:22.789 --> 05:24.557
I know I fouled up,

05:24.591 --> 05:27.760
but killing that prisoner...

05:30.597 --> 05:33.231
It'll haunt me
for the rest of my days.

05:37.102 --> 05:40.470
You acted in self-defense.
You've been exonerated.

05:43.908 --> 05:46.309
Take a week's leave,
get some rest.

05:46.344 --> 05:47.878
Yes, sir.

05:47.912 --> 05:50.013
Thank you, sir.

05:51.482 --> 05:53.583
That is all.

06:00.590 --> 06:03.993
Have you any idea, Nelson,

06:04.027 --> 06:07.396
the embarrassment

06:07.430 --> 06:09.698
this incident has brought
upon the department?

06:09.732 --> 06:12.701
I take full responsibility
for winslow's death, sir.

06:12.735 --> 06:14.002
That's fine, Nelson,

06:14.036 --> 06:16.504
because that's precisely
where I place the blame.

06:16.539 --> 06:18.406
<i>I told you
I wanted numbers,</i>

06:18.441 --> 06:20.441
<i>arrests relating
to alcohol.</i>

06:20.475 --> 06:23.177
Winslow's confession is a
direct link to Nucky Thompson.

06:23.211 --> 06:25.614
Winslow is dead.
His confession is useless hearsay.

06:25.648 --> 06:27.716
I'll have another
crack at Darmody.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.052
Darmody has been released
for lack of evidence.

06:30.086 --> 06:32.387
<i>Thompson's lawyers
are swarming like hornets.</i>

06:32.422 --> 06:35.390
He committed murder on a direct
order from Nucky Thompson.

06:35.424 --> 06:38.293
For God's sakes, man, you have
bungled this from the start!

06:49.772 --> 06:52.674
This is your
last chance, Nelson.

06:52.708 --> 06:54.843
One more misstep and you'll be

06:54.877 --> 06:58.780
hunting moonshiners
down in the everglades.

07:34.549 --> 07:36.751
Don't stop.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.021
There's coffee.

07:45.226 --> 07:48.661
Your mother took Tommy to
child's for an ice cream.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.501
He's a good boy.

08:04.012 --> 08:07.682
<i>It's nice...
the skin tones.</i>

08:07.716 --> 08:09.651
Thank you.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.521
I also like the other one...

08:12.555 --> 08:15.057
the lady with the flowers.

08:15.091 --> 08:18.326
I didn't even think
you noticed.

08:26.202 --> 08:28.803
Over in Europe,

08:28.838 --> 08:30.672
in the war...

08:30.706 --> 08:35.143
art, painting, poetry...

08:35.177 --> 08:38.279
two weeks in the trench
and you forget

08:38.313 --> 08:40.481
that there's anything beautiful

08:40.515 --> 08:43.583
in the civilized world.

09:16.351 --> 09:18.653
That's it.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.524
A little red.

09:26.261 --> 09:28.363
That's better.

10:35.731 --> 10:38.366
Anything on the ratification?

10:38.400 --> 10:40.701
It's all in the hands
of Tennessee.

10:40.736 --> 10:42.537
One more state,

10:42.571 --> 10:44.739
then women will have
the right to vote.

10:46.408 --> 10:48.944
You look doubtful.

10:48.978 --> 10:51.613
I don't want you
to be disappointed.

10:51.647 --> 10:54.349
The south... they're not
exactly known

10:54.383 --> 10:56.351
for their forward-thinking
down there.

10:59.521 --> 11:02.556
Your driver
Mr. Kessler is here.

11:02.590 --> 11:04.591
Five minutes.

11:09.931 --> 11:11.999
I don't mean
to be cruel, but...

11:12.034 --> 11:14.201
He's a war hero, Margaret.

11:14.235 --> 11:15.869
He frightens the children.

11:15.903 --> 11:19.506
He's here for your protection,
for their protection.

11:21.208 --> 11:23.176
These men who are after you...

11:23.210 --> 11:26.479
- Has anything been done?
- It's being handled.

11:26.513 --> 11:29.182
- By the sheriff?
- And his deputies.

11:30.684 --> 11:34.287
Perhaps the children and I
should go away for a while.

11:34.321 --> 11:37.190
That won't be necessary.

11:38.593 --> 11:41.194
Besides, I'd miss you too much.

11:43.130 --> 11:45.698
Is this what it means
to be in charge...

11:45.733 --> 11:47.901
people shooting at you?

11:49.203 --> 11:51.537
Success breeds enemies,

11:51.572 --> 11:53.573
which you'll discover
soon enough

11:53.607 --> 11:56.109
after women win the vote.

12:00.781 --> 12:03.549
Stock prices over the ticker,

12:03.583 --> 12:05.518
racing results by wire.

12:05.552 --> 12:07.987
Soon radio, I'm told,
will transmit news stories

12:08.021 --> 12:09.889
within minutes
of their occurrence.

12:09.923 --> 12:12.324
It's the age of information.

12:12.359 --> 12:16.829
And a businessman lives and
sometimes dies on its value.

12:19.132 --> 12:22.468
Do you know why I'm a
successful gambler, Mr. Doyle?

12:22.502 --> 12:25.504
'Cause you're lucky?

12:26.739 --> 12:31.476
He's lucky.
I create my luck.

12:31.511 --> 12:33.478
I'm a successful gambler

12:33.513 --> 12:35.480
because I never bet on an event

12:35.515 --> 12:37.916
whose outcome I'm not sure.

12:37.950 --> 12:39.618
Like the world series.

12:41.287 --> 12:44.456
You put the fix in.

12:44.490 --> 12:48.393
I employ research,
fact-finding.

12:48.427 --> 12:50.662
"Due diligence"
the lawyers call it.

12:50.696 --> 12:52.597
Which brings me
to Nucky Thompson...

12:52.632 --> 12:55.467
the man you said you know
everything about.

12:55.501 --> 12:58.236
How was I supposed to know
his chauffeur carries a gun?

12:58.271 --> 13:02.040
Have you been listening
to a single word I've said?!

13:03.175 --> 13:06.778
<i>Sheer and utter
incompetence.</i>

13:06.812 --> 13:09.113
A woman is shot...

13:09.233 --> 13:11.943
An innocent tourist no less and...

13:12.210 --> 13:13.850
you've tipped my hand to Thompson.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.502
A boardwalk at night doing public...

13:16.622 --> 13:18.689
we figureit sends a message.

13:18.724 --> 13:20.658
You sent a message all right...

13:20.692 --> 13:22.326
That you're idiots.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.931
Devil's food?

13:26.965 --> 13:28.799
- Yes sir.
- Thank you.

13:28.833 --> 13:31.168
I'll kill that prick
myself, Mr. Rothstein.

13:31.202 --> 13:33.103
We'll bring you his head
if you want.

13:33.137 --> 13:35.706
Your grandstanding
is commendable,

13:35.740 --> 13:39.043
but I have to say
I'm less than convinced.

13:39.077 --> 13:43.380
We had bad information,
like you said.

13:43.415 --> 13:45.682
How can we make it up to you?

13:49.220 --> 13:52.255
Nothing says "I'm sorry"
like money.

13:59.396 --> 14:03.333
2 1/2 million people
in Chicago alone,

14:03.367 --> 14:05.502
<i>figure half of them
are men.</i>

14:05.536 --> 14:07.404
<i>- Half of those...
- Put that in.</i>

14:07.438 --> 14:09.839
<i>...Are adult men,
and there's my point.</i>

14:09.874 --> 14:12.275
With over a half million
potential customers

14:12.309 --> 14:14.210
who wanna drink whiskey
and fuck,

14:14.244 --> 14:16.245
why ain't we making more money?

14:17.681 --> 14:20.749
Fuck you doin'?
Are you listening?

14:20.784 --> 14:22.351
What?

14:22.385 --> 14:24.387
Are you listening?

14:24.421 --> 14:26.722
Yeah, the money.

14:27.758 --> 14:30.793
Mr. Torrio,
Jake Guzik.

14:30.827 --> 14:32.595
Sure, send him in.

14:34.698 --> 14:36.566
There's the beer baron.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.701
Are you giving the cooze away?

14:38.735 --> 14:40.336
I had to park
all the way up wabash.

14:40.370 --> 14:42.271
A little exercise
will kill you?

14:42.305 --> 14:44.740
I get enough exercise
carrying your dough.

14:48.711 --> 14:50.311
All this from the brewery?

14:50.346 --> 14:53.181
I go home stinking of beer,
but who's complaining?

14:53.215 --> 14:56.217
When he ran the brothel,
he stank of pussy.

14:56.252 --> 14:59.355
So long as it ain't Kugel,
the wife stays off my back.

14:59.389 --> 15:01.423
I wanted to talk to you
about expanding,

15:01.458 --> 15:03.692
and not just your
waistline neither.

15:03.727 --> 15:07.263
- I was saying...
- Johnny, turkish.

15:07.298 --> 15:08.998
Before you come in,
I was saying

15:09.033 --> 15:11.133
a lot of money being
left on the table.

15:11.168 --> 15:14.103
As far as I'm concerned, the
whole north side is wide open.

15:15.973 --> 15:18.040
There's entire
10-block stretches

15:18.075 --> 15:20.576
without a single cathouse
or a place to get a drink.

15:25.882 --> 15:27.083
The fuck is this?

15:27.117 --> 15:29.618
It's a load from the joke shop.

15:29.653 --> 15:31.053
What, are you 12 years old?

15:31.088 --> 15:33.422
It's a joke.
I'm sorry.

15:33.456 --> 15:35.724
You are sorry.
You're a sorry fucking moron.

15:35.759 --> 15:37.659
I thought you'd have a laugh.

15:37.693 --> 15:41.596
I'm in the middle
of a fucking meeting!

15:49.972 --> 15:52.707
We'll talk Saturday, your
kid's... What do you call it?

15:52.742 --> 15:54.142
Bar mitzvah.

15:54.176 --> 15:55.610
Yeah.

15:55.644 --> 15:58.580
This ain't no fucking
grade school.

16:00.883 --> 16:02.918
He's grotesque, James.

16:02.952 --> 16:05.554
And believe me, I've seen
my share of freak shows.

16:05.588 --> 16:07.589
Apparently it's
a big improvement

16:07.624 --> 16:09.458
over how he looked
before the surgery.

16:09.492 --> 16:11.693
Try explaining that
to a four-year-old.

16:11.728 --> 16:13.529
From now on,
when he's in the house,

16:13.563 --> 16:15.998
<i>just tell him to keep the mask on.</i>

16:16.032 --> 16:19.201
Mickey Doyle.

16:19.235 --> 16:20.602
What about him?

16:20.637 --> 16:22.638
<i>- To see you.
- Here?</i>

16:22.672 --> 16:24.506
Shall I frisk him?

16:24.541 --> 16:27.075
You're Tom mix all of a sudden?

16:27.110 --> 16:28.810
<i>You do it.</i>

16:48.497 --> 16:51.732
Nucky, hey.
How you been?

16:51.767 --> 16:54.168
- What do you want, Mickey?
- Come on, Nuck.

16:54.203 --> 16:56.604
I come to youse hat in hand.

16:59.408 --> 17:01.509
I'm came to apologize is all.

17:01.543 --> 17:03.544
I got rattled when you
took my operation.

17:03.579 --> 17:06.113
So you pick yourself up
by the bootstraps.

17:06.147 --> 17:10.384
Yeah, but I told you
I had partners.

17:10.419 --> 17:11.786
So?

17:11.819 --> 17:14.688
The D'Alessio brothers.

17:14.723 --> 17:17.290
- From Philly?
- Mm-hmm.

17:17.325 --> 17:19.460
- They're your partners?
- Mm-hmm.

17:23.598 --> 17:25.867
I should throw you out
that fucking window.

17:25.901 --> 17:28.269
I'm sorry. I didn't know
what they was planning.

17:28.303 --> 17:30.404
Not half as sorry
as you're gonna be.

17:30.438 --> 17:32.973
I can help.
That's why I come here.

17:33.007 --> 17:35.308
I'll tell youse
everything I know.

17:40.514 --> 17:43.316
Get him a drink.

17:43.350 --> 17:45.518
I should piss in it.

18:08.341 --> 18:11.977
It started months back,
after I got out of jail.

18:12.012 --> 18:14.947
They wanted their dough,
which I didn't have,

18:14.981 --> 18:17.616
so they got the idea to put
Chalky out of business.

18:17.650 --> 18:19.418
- The lynching... that was them?
- Mm-hmm.

18:19.452 --> 18:20.986
They robbed your
ward boss too...

18:21.020 --> 18:23.922
the fat one, plus the casino.

18:23.956 --> 18:26.558
They shot my brother, Mickey,
took a shot at me.

18:26.592 --> 18:28.626
I know it.

18:30.096 --> 18:32.931
They're gonna shoot me, Nuck.
I know that too.

18:32.965 --> 18:35.900
- How? - They're always
jabbering in Italian,

18:35.934 --> 18:38.102
laughing at me behind my back,

18:38.136 --> 18:39.670
right to my face.

18:39.705 --> 18:42.073
And Luciano...
how does he figure in?

18:42.108 --> 18:45.143
<i>- Your mother didn't tell you?
- Watch your step, Mickey.</i>

18:45.177 --> 18:47.679
He's got this kid... some
sheeny named Lansky.

18:47.713 --> 18:49.948
He approached Chalky,
made him an offer,

18:49.982 --> 18:51.616
but it was really
just a whatsit.

18:51.651 --> 18:53.718
- A ruse?
- That's the ticket.

18:53.753 --> 18:55.653
To find out how many
bottles he's moving.

18:55.688 --> 18:58.156
- Why does he wanna know that?
- Why do you think?

18:58.190 --> 19:00.458
For information.

19:00.492 --> 19:02.693
This is all on orders
from Rothstein.

19:02.728 --> 19:03.961
<i>He wants to muscle in,</i>

19:03.996 --> 19:06.930
take over the liquor business
in Atlantic City.

19:06.965 --> 19:08.966
Ruining baseball isn't enough?

19:10.402 --> 19:12.403
Get Chalky on the phone.

19:12.437 --> 19:14.171
Yeah.

19:14.205 --> 19:16.507
For what?

19:21.780 --> 19:23.580
Eddie's on the line.

19:23.615 --> 19:26.316
God damn it.
Eddie!

19:27.752 --> 19:29.253
<i>Hang up
the goddamn phone.</i>

19:29.287 --> 19:31.622
That was Trenton.
It just came over the wire...

19:31.656 --> 19:35.125
The women have received
the permission to vote.

19:41.766 --> 19:44.668
"'I built that palace,
and the Emerald City too, '

19:44.703 --> 19:46.904
remarked the wizard
in a thoughtful tone.

19:46.938 --> 19:48.505
'And I'd like
to see them again,

19:48.540 --> 19:51.541
<i>for I was very happy among
the munchkins and winkies</i>

19:51.576 --> 19:53.477
<i>and quadlings
and gillikins.'</i>

19:53.511 --> 19:55.579
'who are they?'
Asked the boy.

19:55.613 --> 19:58.982
'The four nations that inhabit
the land of Oz, ' was the reply."

20:06.323 --> 20:09.058
Mm, sorry.

20:13.497 --> 20:15.264
Mr. Harrow.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.767
Hmm?

20:19.703 --> 20:23.038
We're reading "The Wizard
of Oz" by Frank Baum.

20:23.073 --> 20:25.407
<i>Yes.</i>

20:25.442 --> 20:28.777
Please join us if you'd like.

20:29.846 --> 20:32.381
Mm, thank you.

20:39.956 --> 20:43.626
"'I wonder if they would treat me
nicely if I went there again.'

20:43.661 --> 20:46.129
'of course they would, '
declared Dorothy.

20:46.163 --> 20:48.465
'They are still proud
of their former wizard,

20:48.499 --> 20:50.900
and often speak
of you kindly.'

20:50.935 --> 20:53.870
'do you happen to know whatever
became of the tin woodsman

20:53.904 --> 20:56.372
and the scarecrow?'
He enquired.

20:56.407 --> 20:58.374
'They live in Oz yet, '
said the girl,

20:58.409 --> 21:00.576
'and are very
important people.'"

21:04.715 --> 21:07.516
mm, the tin woodsman.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.120
That's me.

21:14.791 --> 21:18.027
Oh, I think I need some oil.

21:20.130 --> 21:22.398
Mama, it's really him?

21:22.432 --> 21:24.233
Why yes, dear,

21:24.267 --> 21:26.535
directly from oz.

21:29.239 --> 21:31.173
And who better
to have in our house

21:31.207 --> 21:34.276
than the mighty tin woodsman?

22:41.077 --> 22:44.212
I won't insult you
by asking if you want any,

22:44.246 --> 22:46.581
but I hope you don't mind
if I have a taste.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.417
Good news just isn't
the same without it.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.686
Annabelle offered me
some earlier.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.422
Does that mean
I shouldn't try again?

22:54.456 --> 22:56.591
Well,

22:56.625 --> 22:59.093
<i>it is a special
occasion.</i>

22:59.127 --> 23:01.028
That it is.

23:02.331 --> 23:04.098
Thank you.

23:10.238 --> 23:12.039
To the women's vote.

23:12.073 --> 23:14.341
You've caught up
with Ireland at last.

23:14.376 --> 23:16.544
It's your country too,
you know.

23:23.752 --> 23:25.385
You're aware, of course,

23:25.420 --> 23:28.122
of all the republican party
has done for social progress...

23:28.156 --> 23:30.457
emancipation, prohibition.

23:30.492 --> 23:32.293
We backed
the women's vote early.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.729
Because you saw an opportunity.

23:35.763 --> 23:38.165
A simple "thank you"
would be fine.

23:39.066 --> 23:41.168
Thank you.

23:46.407 --> 23:49.309
Sunday, at the league
of women voters luncheon,

23:49.343 --> 23:52.779
Mayor Bacharach will be announcing
that he won't be seeking reelection.

23:52.813 --> 23:54.781
I'd like you to tell the ladies

23:54.815 --> 23:57.751
why Edward Bader
should be his replacement.

23:57.785 --> 24:00.153
And why should he be?

24:00.187 --> 24:03.056
Because he's the right man
for the job.

24:03.090 --> 24:05.392
The owner of
a construction business?

24:05.426 --> 24:07.861
Who's going to help me
build great things

24:07.895 --> 24:09.896
for the people of this city.

24:11.632 --> 24:14.000
But how does that
qualify him to be Mayor?

24:14.034 --> 24:17.904
Andrew Johnson was a tailor
and he became president.

24:17.938 --> 24:20.239
Wasn't he impeached?

24:20.274 --> 24:23.476
That's completely
beside the point.

24:27.915 --> 24:29.883
What am I meant to say?

24:29.917 --> 24:31.684
<i>That it's time
for a change,</i>

24:31.719 --> 24:33.986
that it's a new
republican party.

24:34.021 --> 24:36.422
The cronyism, the incompetence,

24:36.456 --> 24:38.757
the violence in our streets...

24:38.792 --> 24:41.260
All that's a thing of the past.

24:41.294 --> 24:43.262
Is it?

24:43.296 --> 24:45.597
What do you mean?

24:45.631 --> 24:47.566
If Bader is elected,

24:47.600 --> 24:49.367
what happens to
the county treasurer?

24:49.402 --> 24:51.570
Me? I'm not
going anywhere.

24:51.604 --> 24:54.306
You'll control the new Mayor
just like the old one.

24:54.340 --> 24:57.709
I don't control
anyone, Margaret.

24:57.744 --> 24:59.578
I'm more of an overseer.

24:59.612 --> 25:02.814
For this city to work, for business
to be done over the long haul,

25:02.849 --> 25:05.951
there needs to be cooperation,
continuity of leadership.

25:05.985 --> 25:09.087
As county treasurer,
I provide that continuity.

25:09.122 --> 25:11.089
Fletcher and these
other democrats...

25:11.123 --> 25:13.091
they'd be starting
from scratch.

25:13.125 --> 25:15.560
You're asking me to lie

25:15.594 --> 25:18.396
about Bader's qualifications.

25:21.901 --> 25:24.436
I'm asking you to be realistic.

25:24.470 --> 25:26.404
This isn't some fantasy world

25:26.438 --> 25:28.239
like in one of those
children's books.

25:28.273 --> 25:30.007
It's a real place
with real people.

25:30.042 --> 25:32.910
And sometimes,
to make it run properly,

25:32.945 --> 25:35.946
we need to tell those people
what they want to hear.

25:38.016 --> 25:40.084
This is important, Margaret,

25:40.118 --> 25:43.487
not just for
the republican party.

25:43.521 --> 25:45.789
It's important for you too.

26:02.675 --> 26:04.843
I've read about this place.

26:06.679 --> 26:08.380
Look at this.
Look, Tommy, look.

26:08.414 --> 26:10.014
This is where we got you.

26:10.048 --> 26:12.649
They cooked you up in one
of those incubators,

26:12.683 --> 26:15.483
wrapped you up in a diaper
and then we took you home.

26:15.517 --> 26:17.652
You're fooling me.

26:17.686 --> 26:19.754
Fooling you, huh?

26:19.788 --> 26:21.889
Arr!

26:21.924 --> 26:23.992
Hey, where are you going?

26:24.026 --> 26:26.895
Tommy, Tommy, come here.

26:26.929 --> 26:29.030
Come here.

26:29.031 --> 26:31.366
You want some Taffy?

26:31.400 --> 26:34.502
That's mommy's kissing friend.

26:34.537 --> 26:35.970
What'd you say?

26:36.005 --> 26:38.806
That's mommy's kissing friend.

26:40.375 --> 26:44.011
Kissing friend?

26:50.752 --> 26:52.720
Son of a bitch.

26:52.754 --> 26:54.555
Jimmy, what's wrong?

26:54.589 --> 26:57.458
Ask your son.

26:57.492 --> 27:00.060
Wendell, I'm gonna
need you to be very still,

27:00.095 --> 27:02.029
like a statue in a museum.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.508
Wendell!

27:18.580 --> 27:20.247
You wanna have
your mettle tested?

27:20.282 --> 27:22.149
Oh my God!

27:22.183 --> 27:23.984
Get back!

27:29.423 --> 27:32.792
- Hey, there's a fight going on.
- Jimmy.

27:32.827 --> 27:35.228
Don't fucking move.

27:35.263 --> 27:37.164
<i>Jimmy!</i>

27:37.198 --> 27:39.532
Jimmy, why are you doing this?

27:39.567 --> 27:41.301
- Jimmy, stop.
- Stop.

27:41.335 --> 27:42.869
Jimmy!

27:42.903 --> 27:45.739
Hey buddy. Hey pal.

27:45.773 --> 27:47.173
Jimmy, stop it, please.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.309
Daddy.

27:50.412 --> 27:54.115
This man had relations
with my wife...

27:54.149 --> 27:57.552
- That's not true.
- ...When I was away in the war.

27:57.587 --> 27:59.921
- No, Jimmy.
- Daddy daddy.

27:59.955 --> 28:01.589
Please stop it.

28:01.623 --> 28:03.391
<i>Daddy!</i>

28:06.428 --> 28:08.528
Coming.

28:14.702 --> 28:15.935
Ma'am.

28:15.970 --> 28:18.071
Agent van Alden.

28:18.105 --> 28:20.840
May I come in?

28:20.874 --> 28:22.875
Of course, yes.

28:22.910 --> 28:24.677
Please.

28:34.154 --> 28:36.956
This is Mr. Harrow.

28:37.858 --> 28:39.792
I'm a federal Agent.

28:39.826 --> 28:43.595
I need to speak privately
with Mrs. Schroeder.

28:43.630 --> 28:46.398
I'll be out back
with the children.

29:01.881 --> 29:05.016
Mrs. Schroeder, I'm going
to show you a photograph.

29:05.051 --> 29:07.152
I'd like to know

29:07.186 --> 29:09.321
if you recognize this girl.

29:13.826 --> 29:16.027
Is this meant to be a joke?

29:16.061 --> 29:18.763
I find nothing funny about it.

29:21.166 --> 29:23.267
That's me,

29:23.301 --> 29:24.902
taken at Ellis island.

29:24.937 --> 29:27.772
After your long journey
from kerry.

29:27.807 --> 29:30.408
That's right.

29:30.442 --> 29:33.878
When I look at
this girl, I see hope,

29:33.913 --> 29:35.747
yearning,

29:35.781 --> 29:38.917
a promise for a new life,

29:38.951 --> 29:43.254
the promise of America.

29:43.289 --> 29:46.023
What happened to that girl,
Mrs. Schroeder?

29:46.058 --> 29:49.060
Am I to be deported?

29:49.094 --> 29:51.395
<i>I'm a citizen
of this country now.</i>

29:51.430 --> 29:53.864
Mrs. Schroeder,
you are consorting

29:53.899 --> 29:55.832
with a murderer,

29:55.867 --> 29:58.735
the man who killed
the father of your children.

29:58.769 --> 30:01.203
- That's not true.
- It is true.

30:01.238 --> 30:03.505
He's a panderer and a criminal.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.875
Mr. Thompson
is one of the most...

30:05.909 --> 30:09.880
Your life doesn't have
to be like this.

30:09.914 --> 30:12.517
And I know you don't
want it to be.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.988
You don't know me at all.

30:16.023 --> 30:18.624
I see into your soul, Margaret,

30:18.659 --> 30:21.794
at night when I look
at this picture.

30:26.132 --> 30:27.599
Give me that photograph.

30:27.634 --> 30:29.602
Listen to me.

30:29.636 --> 30:33.372
How dare you lecture me?

30:33.407 --> 30:35.375
You gained entrance to my home

30:35.409 --> 30:37.677
on the pretense
of official business

30:37.711 --> 30:39.678
when your true intentions
are obviously

30:39.712 --> 30:43.015
something quite different.

30:43.049 --> 30:45.584
Is this the life you want?

30:45.618 --> 30:47.786
I can offer you salvation.

30:47.821 --> 30:50.923
I want you to leave now.

30:56.596 --> 30:58.597
I came here to save you...

30:58.631 --> 31:01.800
not from prosecution,
but from the fires of hell

31:01.834 --> 31:04.836
that will surely await you
should you fail to repent.

31:31.500 --> 31:35.603
You need to say
this word for word.

31:35.638 --> 31:37.238
Hey.

31:37.273 --> 31:38.707
Find us some seats.

31:38.741 --> 31:40.743
How you doing?
Thanks for coming.

31:40.777 --> 31:42.678
Hiya.
Who's this handsome man?

31:42.713 --> 31:44.880
My son Charles.
This is John.

31:49.349 --> 31:50.781
Hello.

31:50.816 --> 31:51.915
Hey.

31:51.949 --> 31:53.748
You must wear a hat
in the synagogue.

31:53.782 --> 31:55.415
It's a sign of respect.

31:56.549 --> 31:58.717
To wear it's a sign of respect?

31:58.752 --> 31:59.952
Yes.

31:59.987 --> 32:02.488
Wear a hat in church...
they box your ears in.

32:02.522 --> 32:05.792
In the Jewish religion
men wear a yarmulke

32:05.826 --> 32:09.062
to remind us
that God is above us.

32:11.532 --> 32:13.667
You're a friend
of the bar mitzvah?

32:13.701 --> 32:17.337
- Jake?
- Mr. Guzik's son.

32:17.372 --> 32:20.841
Yeah, I'm an associate
of Jake's.

32:26.214 --> 32:29.249
Hey, so this party...

32:29.284 --> 32:31.218
What is it exactly?

32:31.252 --> 32:33.587
When a Jewish boy reaches 13,

32:33.621 --> 32:36.323
he becomes a son
of the commandment.

32:36.357 --> 32:40.127
And this celebration affirms
his obligations as a man.

32:40.161 --> 32:41.528
What, at 13?

32:41.562 --> 32:43.229
Do you not feel
that's old enough

32:43.264 --> 32:46.633
to be held accountable
for your actions?

32:46.667 --> 32:48.468
I know the state does.

32:48.502 --> 32:50.604
That's why they got
reform school.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.108
All of us who are
worth anything

32:55.143 --> 32:57.510
spend our manhood unlearning

32:57.545 --> 33:00.246
the follies of our youth.

33:01.916 --> 33:03.783
Gentlemen,
we're about to begin.

33:03.817 --> 33:06.486
- We'll finish this later.
- Good, okay.

33:11.959 --> 33:13.926
You should wear a yarmulke.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.294
What's wrong with this?

33:15.328 --> 33:17.262
You're a man,

33:17.297 --> 33:19.764
yet you wear the cap of a boy.

33:37.785 --> 33:40.654
# amen. #

34:07.447 --> 34:10.014
# Amen. #

34:13.353 --> 34:15.487
Mazel tov!

34:22.829 --> 34:24.728
Meyer Lansky...

34:24.762 --> 34:26.728
That's the kid
who came to see you.

34:26.763 --> 34:28.964
He told me his name
was Michael Lewis.

34:28.998 --> 34:32.100
So he doesn't have to change
the monogram on his shirts.

34:32.134 --> 34:34.134
He's in cahoots
with Arnold Rothstein

34:34.168 --> 34:36.136
and this family of dagos
out of Philly.

34:36.170 --> 34:37.804
Charlie Luciano too.

34:37.840 --> 34:41.175
- Those the boys who shot you?
- Among other things.

34:41.210 --> 34:44.478
<i>They shot at him.
They were not successful.</i>

34:44.513 --> 34:46.313
Why are you still here?

34:46.348 --> 34:49.150
If there will be
nothing else...

34:53.655 --> 34:55.889
Sorry I'm late.

34:59.161 --> 35:01.028
What'd you do to your hand?

35:01.063 --> 35:03.931
I slammed it in the icebox.

35:05.868 --> 35:08.136
I want you to meet with Lansky.

35:08.170 --> 35:09.971
Mickey here will arrange it.

35:10.005 --> 35:11.505
Tell him you accept his offer.

35:11.540 --> 35:14.375
- What offer?
- Whatever offer he makes.

35:14.409 --> 35:16.176
Tell him you're unhappy,

35:16.211 --> 35:18.345
that Nucky's not
treating you right.

35:18.379 --> 35:19.779
That shouldn't be
too hard to believe.

35:19.814 --> 35:21.881
You're lucky to be alive,
you fucking polack.

35:21.915 --> 35:24.984
Promise them as much
liquor as they want

35:25.018 --> 35:27.652
<i>and tell them they'll need all
their men to haul the load.</i>

35:27.687 --> 35:30.922
The idea is to get as many of
them in the same place as we can.

35:30.956 --> 35:34.858
Remembering, of course,
it was me set it up.

35:39.829 --> 35:42.297
So, uh...

35:42.331 --> 35:46.671
When all is said and done,

35:46.705 --> 35:49.808
what you fixing to do
about Mr. Rothstein?

35:49.842 --> 35:54.583
I'm going to make him the
richest corpse in New York.

35:55.886 --> 35:58.154
And go though I must,

35:58.188 --> 36:00.890
<i>I assure you I do so
with a heavy heart.</i>

36:00.924 --> 36:03.025
<i>But behind my sadness</i>

36:03.060 --> 36:06.929
there is also great pride

36:06.964 --> 36:10.967
in what we have achieved
as a community

36:11.001 --> 36:13.703
and... and a great
optimism...

36:13.737 --> 36:15.938
It's perfectly natural
to be nervous.

36:15.972 --> 36:17.873
Just remember to breathe.

36:17.907 --> 36:20.075
It's not nerves exactly.

36:20.109 --> 36:22.244
Did you eat a good breakfast?

36:22.278 --> 36:25.213
- I've got no appetite.
- You'll be fine.

36:25.248 --> 36:28.683
The first time I had to make one
of these speeches I was a wreck.

36:28.718 --> 36:31.286
After a while you can get up
there and sell snake oil.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.989
And my love for public
service shall never cease.

36:38.794 --> 36:40.728
Ladies,

36:40.763 --> 36:42.730
it is now my great pleasure

36:42.765 --> 36:45.967
to introduce
Mrs. Margaret Schroeder.

37:10.491 --> 37:12.660
Thank you, Mayor Bacharach.

37:12.694 --> 37:16.431
And thank you, ladies.

37:16.465 --> 37:20.301
You will surely be missed.

37:26.408 --> 37:30.611
When I was first asked
to speak to you today,

37:30.645 --> 37:33.513
I confess I was at once

37:33.547 --> 37:35.648
flattered and terrified.

37:35.682 --> 37:38.984
Surely an immigrant
to this great country,

37:39.018 --> 37:41.619
a former parlor maid,
could have little

37:41.654 --> 37:44.288
to contribute
to political discourse.

37:44.322 --> 37:46.623
<i>But when I heard
I was to speak</i>

37:46.657 --> 37:48.659
<i>in support of Edward Bader
for Mayor,</i>

37:48.693 --> 37:51.563
<i>I put my
trepidations aside</i>

37:51.597 --> 37:53.999
<i>and decided to speak to you
from the heart.</i>

37:54.033 --> 37:55.167
I know.
I know.

37:55.201 --> 37:58.070
I first met Mr. Bader
socially

37:58.105 --> 38:00.072
in his capacity
as head of the city's

38:00.107 --> 38:01.974
largest construction firm.

38:02.009 --> 38:05.711
<i>Mr. Bader is
quite literally a builder,</i>

38:05.746 --> 38:08.047
a man of great vision.

38:08.081 --> 38:10.850
Where other men see
an empty lot,

38:10.884 --> 38:13.052
he sees a hospital.

38:13.086 --> 38:15.988
<i>Where other men see
an overgrown field,</i>

38:16.022 --> 38:18.323
<i>he sees a school
for our children.</i>

38:18.357 --> 38:20.391
And most importantly perhaps,

38:20.426 --> 38:24.198
where other men see
shopgirls and chambermaids,

38:24.232 --> 38:26.367
Edward Bader sees voters.

38:34.945 --> 38:37.480
Ladies, our newly gained right

38:37.514 --> 38:40.282
also comes with great
responsibility,

38:40.317 --> 38:44.086
<i>a duty to use
our power wisely,</i>

38:44.120 --> 38:47.489
<i>to elect men to office...
worthy men</i>

38:47.524 --> 38:50.826
<i>who will put the interest
of our citizens first.</i>

38:50.860 --> 38:54.396
<i>With us as a foundation,
women voters,</i>

38:54.431 --> 38:58.333
our new Mayor can do great
things for Atlantic City.

38:58.368 --> 39:01.403
And who better to start
with that foundation

39:01.437 --> 39:04.372
than a builder himself?

39:04.407 --> 39:06.708
Ladies, I give you

39:06.742 --> 39:10.912
our next Mayor,
Mr. Edward Bader.

39:20.022 --> 39:22.057
That was wonderful.

39:25.227 --> 39:27.195
<i>Thank you,
Mrs. Schroeder,</i>

39:27.229 --> 39:30.098
<i>for that rousing
introduction.</i>

39:30.132 --> 39:34.503
<i>Ladies, I could not be more
pleased than I am right now</i>

39:34.537 --> 39:36.772
<i>to join you here today</i>

39:36.806 --> 39:38.707
<i>and welcome you</i>

39:38.741 --> 39:42.611
<i>as meaningful partners
in our great democracy.</i>

39:48.117 --> 39:51.653
<i>When I was approached to be part
of this republican ticket,</i>

39:51.687 --> 39:53.655
<i>I was not only humbled</i>

39:53.689 --> 39:56.458
<i>but excited
to continue my work</i>

39:56.492 --> 40:00.428
<i>for the men, the women and the
children of Atlantic City.</i>

40:02.698 --> 40:04.832
...Enjoy yourself there.

40:04.867 --> 40:06.968
We'll have some drinks.

40:08.370 --> 40:10.404
Mr. Torrio.

40:15.344 --> 40:17.145
<i>Where are you goin'?</i>

40:17.179 --> 40:19.647
Wherever you tell me.

40:23.519 --> 40:25.320
I'm here to apologize.

40:25.354 --> 40:28.323
The joke, the cigarette load...

40:28.357 --> 40:29.791
That was stupid.

40:29.825 --> 40:31.893
You can't do that shit no more.

40:31.927 --> 40:34.028
I know.

40:36.632 --> 40:39.100
You know,

40:39.134 --> 40:42.337
I brung you out here from
Brooklyn for a reason, kid.

40:42.371 --> 40:45.406
I thought I saw
something in you.

40:45.441 --> 40:47.909
A fella like guzik...

40:47.943 --> 40:50.644
Three years ago
he's running a cathouse.

40:50.679 --> 40:52.579
Now look at him today.

40:52.613 --> 40:55.048
You could learn
something from these Jews.

40:55.083 --> 40:57.517
The brewery there...

40:57.552 --> 40:59.719
I hear they're looking
for help.

40:59.754 --> 41:01.821
His distribution's
out of whack.

41:01.856 --> 41:05.126
The fella in there now
has got it all screwed up.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.362
Maybe I can fix it.

41:07.396 --> 41:09.898
No more monkey business, al.

41:09.932 --> 41:11.733
<i>Finito.</i>

41:11.767 --> 41:13.735
I hear you, Mr. Torrio.

41:13.769 --> 41:16.471
All's I'm asking for
is a chance.

41:16.505 --> 41:20.475
I'm ready to be
responsible for my actions.

41:25.748 --> 41:28.116
22 year I know Nucky Thompson,

41:28.150 --> 41:30.651
back when the commodore
had this town.

41:30.686 --> 41:34.188
I ran the dice game here
in chicken bone beach.

41:34.223 --> 41:38.025
Nucky made the commodore
collection.

41:38.060 --> 41:40.962
Then one day I seen
the commodore himself...

41:40.996 --> 41:44.165
a parade here for
Mr. Booker T. Washington,

41:44.199 --> 41:46.133
you know.

41:46.168 --> 41:50.137
"Chalky," he say,
"I got bad news.

41:50.172 --> 41:54.608
Now on you got to pay me
7% of what you been making."

41:54.643 --> 41:57.378
"7%?" I say.

41:57.412 --> 42:00.481
"I been paying Nucky 12 long
for three years now."

42:00.515 --> 42:03.184
Real prick
that guy Thompson, huh?

42:03.218 --> 42:04.685
That's putting it kindly, son.

42:04.719 --> 42:06.721
- He was skimming off the top.
- Yes.

42:06.755 --> 42:09.790
Thank you.I get it.

42:09.825 --> 42:13.227
Well, I hope his reputation
precedes him,

42:13.261 --> 42:15.730
but Mr. Rothstein doesn't
do business like that.

42:15.764 --> 42:17.965
<i>Chiseling your partners...
it's short-sighted.</i>

42:17.999 --> 42:20.835
- We're looking to the future.
- These stills,

42:20.869 --> 42:23.370
this piss water
you're bottling...

42:23.405 --> 42:25.673
Don't get me wrong,
it's fine for some people,

42:25.707 --> 42:28.642
but we're looking
for the real stuff.

42:28.677 --> 42:31.211
Can you part with
500 cases a month?

42:31.246 --> 42:33.947
You know I can,

42:33.982 --> 42:36.817
Mr. Lewis.

42:38.353 --> 42:39.886
No offense.

42:39.921 --> 42:42.689
That was before Mr.
Doyle here told us how unhappy you were.

42:42.724 --> 42:46.092
Yeah, now that we know, you'll be
our contact down in Atlantic City.

42:46.127 --> 42:48.495
Play your cards right...
you can buy a packard

42:48.529 --> 42:50.430
for every day in the week.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.935
Tomorrow late
we'll send trucks.

42:54.969 --> 42:56.970
The money too.

43:04.245 --> 43:05.645
What about Nucky?

43:05.680 --> 43:07.113
Fuck him.

43:07.148 --> 43:08.982
By which he means

43:09.016 --> 43:11.251
you're under the wing
of Arnold Rothstein now.

43:11.285 --> 43:13.920
New York life don't
offer protection that good.

43:15.957 --> 43:18.491
One more thing:

43:20.694 --> 43:24.464
How do you know
I drive a packard?

43:28.836 --> 43:31.337
- Oh, the lights!
- It's something.

43:31.372 --> 43:33.206
- It is.
- I'm so glad we came.

43:33.240 --> 43:35.208
<i>Me too.</i>

43:44.952 --> 43:48.821
I stopped by the hospital.
They said you'd already left.

43:48.855 --> 43:52.458
He's sleeping.
They gave him morphine.

43:52.492 --> 43:55.795
Five broken ribs, his nose,
a fractured jaw.

43:57.697 --> 44:00.866
- I'm so sorry, Mary.
- It's not your fault. It's mine.

44:00.901 --> 44:03.135
- Yours? - I should have
left him months ago.

44:03.170 --> 44:06.005
I don't love him.

44:06.039 --> 44:08.107
This never would have happened.

44:08.141 --> 44:11.477
It's not that easy.

44:33.833 --> 44:36.268
I just can't bear it anymore.

44:36.302 --> 44:37.936
Has he hurt you?

44:37.971 --> 44:41.306
No, not yet.

44:41.341 --> 44:45.510
But he's not the same person I knew.

44:45.545 --> 44:48.113
Come away with me...

44:48.147 --> 44:50.248
you and Tommy.

44:51.250 --> 44:53.852
- Where?
- To Paris.

44:57.857 --> 45:00.025
- What about Robert?
- He'll be fine.

45:00.059 --> 45:02.027
He'll recover from his injuries

45:02.061 --> 45:04.929
and move on with his life.

45:05.998 --> 45:08.066
Jimmy will never let me go.

45:08.100 --> 45:10.902
He'll never know
where to find us.

45:10.936 --> 45:13.805
Imagine Tommy growing up
along the seine,

45:13.839 --> 45:15.440
speaking French.

45:15.474 --> 45:18.676
He'd be nothing like his father

45:18.711 --> 45:20.612
or any of them.

45:20.646 --> 45:24.015
Isadora Duncan has a school
on rue danton.

45:24.049 --> 45:26.618
The children wear
grecian tunics.

45:26.652 --> 45:28.786
She inspires them
to find their muses

45:28.821 --> 45:32.390
and free their spirits.

45:32.424 --> 45:35.960
There's a ship
leaving once a month.

45:40.432 --> 45:43.401
<i>Nous devons aller
a Paris.</i>

45:43.435 --> 45:45.603
Say it.

45:45.637 --> 45:49.340
What does it mean?

45:49.374 --> 45:51.843
We must go to Paris.

45:58.116 --> 46:04.388
<i>Nous devons aller
a Paris.</i>

46:08.360 --> 46:10.494
And so we must.

46:24.442 --> 46:26.576
Thank you, deputy Halloran.

46:26.611 --> 46:30.647
Could be sheriff Halloran
come November...

46:30.681 --> 46:32.782
If Eli's not better.

47:00.277 --> 47:02.311
The children are asleep.

47:02.345 --> 47:04.980
Mrs. charlton
just left.

47:05.015 --> 47:07.516
No trouble, I take it?

47:07.550 --> 47:08.884
No.

47:08.918 --> 47:11.153
They're very obedient.

47:17.527 --> 47:20.863
To guard against intruders.

47:22.131 --> 47:25.334
Mr. Harrow,

47:25.368 --> 47:28.870
I feel I owe you an apology.

47:31.374 --> 47:33.575
When you first came here
to guard us,

47:33.609 --> 47:36.144
I treated you harshly.

47:36.178 --> 47:39.814
The truth is your affliction
frightened me.

47:41.584 --> 47:46.221
Mm, people find it
disconcerting.

47:46.255 --> 47:49.524
Well, it's unfair

47:49.558 --> 47:52.560
and I'm sorry.

47:52.595 --> 47:57.032
We should judge the person
on the inside.

47:57.066 --> 47:59.768
Mm, I can't

47:59.802 --> 48:02.371
do that myself.

48:02.405 --> 48:06.374
So why should you be able to?

48:07.676 --> 48:11.813
Sometimes I forget
what I look like.

48:11.847 --> 48:16.351
Then I pass a mirror
and I remember.

48:18.020 --> 48:21.956
I stare sometimes at my face

48:21.990 --> 48:25.593
and I can't recall

48:25.627 --> 48:28.629
who I was before.

49:07.135 --> 49:09.833
What'll you have?

49:14.375 --> 49:16.143
Whiskey.

49:46.940 --> 49:49.475
Again.

50:34.087 --> 50:35.721
May I join you?

50:35.755 --> 50:38.590
Sure.

50:38.624 --> 50:40.492
Why not?

50:46.232 --> 50:48.233
Cigarette?

51:25.371 --> 51:27.773
What's your name, handsome?

51:29.642 --> 51:31.710
Nelson.

51:33.980 --> 51:37.416
I could use another
drink, Nelson.

52:01.907 --> 52:04.876
This here is
Mr. meyer Lansky.

52:06.745 --> 52:10.114
Say hello to Nucky Thompson.

52:10.149 --> 52:12.250
How do you do?

52:13.786 --> 52:16.187
We've already met, actually.

52:16.221 --> 52:18.356
You shot at me
on the boardwalk.

52:18.390 --> 52:21.259
You're confusing me
with somebody else.

52:21.293 --> 52:24.996
There's another dago walking
around with dogshit on his face?

52:32.805 --> 52:35.473
What happened?
You were supposed to make a deal.

52:35.507 --> 52:39.177
Why didn't you tell me these the
motherfuckers that lynched my boy?

52:39.211 --> 52:41.446
Because I hadn't confirmed it.

52:41.480 --> 52:44.849
Well, I got all
the confirmation I need.

52:44.883 --> 52:47.185
There are four more
brothers, Chalky,

52:47.219 --> 52:50.154
plus Luciano.
How are we supposed to get to them now?

52:50.189 --> 52:51.956
Mr. Thompson,
may I speak with you?

53:00.565 --> 53:03.233
I know we've only recently met

53:03.268 --> 53:05.436
and my word doesn't
count for much,

53:05.470 --> 53:07.905
but if you could see
your way to letting me go,

53:07.939 --> 53:09.806
I'm quite certain
I can work out

53:09.841 --> 53:11.808
an accommodation
with Mr. Rothstein.

53:11.843 --> 53:13.844
Mr. Rothstein
made his bed.

53:13.878 --> 53:16.012
Now you fellows can die in it.

53:16.047 --> 53:18.548
Tough talk when
he ain't in the room, right?

53:18.583 --> 53:20.250
What'd you say?

53:20.284 --> 53:22.252
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you heard me.

53:22.286 --> 53:25.488
What I said was you, Mr.
Thompson and this coon here

53:25.523 --> 53:29.059
could all go fuck each other.
Right.

53:33.264 --> 53:35.298
Oh, fucking tough guy.

53:35.332 --> 53:37.233
You gonna shoot me
for mouthing off?

53:37.268 --> 53:40.436
I wasn't going to, but you
kind of talked me into it.

53:55.352 --> 53:56.886
Anybody else?

53:56.921 --> 53:59.656
Jesus Christ.

53:59.690 --> 54:02.058
What do we do with him?

54:02.092 --> 54:06.129
Leave him at the dump with
the rest of the garbage.

54:07.798 --> 54:11.300
My brothers come back...

54:11.335 --> 54:15.137
They're gonna string you up higher
than they did that other fucking coon.

55:23.138 --> 55:26.007
You can go now.

55:26.042 --> 55:28.009
And please tell
Mr. Rothstein

55:28.043 --> 55:30.311
what you saw here tonight.

55:46.027 --> 55:48.729
Fuck me.

55:48.764 --> 55:50.731
Fuck me, daddy.

55:50.765 --> 55:53.067
Oh.

56:05.080 --> 56:06.714
Oh baby.

57:41.874 --> 57:44.342
What time is it?

57:44.376 --> 57:45.776
It's late.

57:45.810 --> 57:48.012
<i>What are you doing up?</i>

57:48.046 --> 57:52.149
I couldn't sleep.

57:52.183 --> 57:54.518
I had business downtown.
I would have called.

57:54.552 --> 57:56.920
Business?

57:56.955 --> 58:00.524
Plotting our strategy
for the election.

58:07.999 --> 58:10.234
You did very well today

58:10.268 --> 58:12.536
with your speech.

58:12.570 --> 58:15.806
You should get some rest.

58:21.779 --> 58:24.614
<i>You had those ladies
eating out of your hand.</i>
