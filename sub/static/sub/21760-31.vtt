my favorite niece, Ivy.

Hold me.

Aw!

01:47.290 --> 01:49.460
So nice to meet you, sir.

01:49.460 --> 01:51.000
I like making new friends.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.540
I picked these
just for you, ma'am.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.000
Aren't they pretty?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.960
Oh!
Thank you, Ivy.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.920
She's a de Vil?

Cruella de Vil!
What?

02:08.580 --> 02:11.000
Oh, dear.
I'll be right there.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.620
Oh, how could I
have forgotten?

02:12.620 --> 02:14.250
I'm missing my elbow
dermabrasion appointment.

02:14.250 --> 02:16.040
I know
I can count on you Dearlys
to look after Ivy.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.880
It's the least you can do

Back soon. Ta-ta!

We'd love you

02:34.250 --> 02:35.710
Thank you, ma'am.

02:35.710 --> 02:37.000
I won't be a bother.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.330
I'll just go
push my baby buggy.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.830
Come on,
cute little puppies.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.330

02:58.500 --> 03:01.290
I bet you puppies
would like a nice little treat.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.920
She's bought my trust!

-Red-hot candy!

04:00.380 --> 04:02.880
Good. Now remember,
your mission

04:02.880 --> 04:04.880
is to create total chaos
in the area

04:04.880 --> 04:07.500
and make it look

are responsible!

04:07.500 --> 04:09.920
I want them to become
such a public nuisance

04:09.920 --> 04:11.830
the Dearlys will be forced

at the Dearly farm,

08:43.250 --> 08:47.380

for Hiccup Hole!

16:04.880 --> 16:07.000
We'll take the shortcut.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.580
Oh!

16:13.880 --> 16:16.290
-All: Ahh!

16:18.670 --> 16:20.920
This is a citizens' arrest.

16:20.920 --> 16:23.120
You have the right
to remain guilty.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.790
Anything you say
will be a lie.

16:25.790 --> 16:29.040
All:
There he is!
Give him a chew toy!

16:33.080 --> 16:36.000
I didn't take that stuff.
I'm innocent.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.960
All:
Innocent, my eye!
You did it!

16:38.960 --> 16:41.710
-No way!
-Cadpig: Ah, ah, ah.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.830
Mooch is right.
He deserves a fair trial.

16:44.830 --> 16:49.170
It will give us
something to do
while we build the gallows.

16:49.170 --> 16:51.380
As mayor of this here
fair farm,

16:51.380 --> 16:53.620
and its highest-ranking
official,

16:53.620 --> 16:56.120
I appoint myself judge.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.710
You'll need a prosecutor.
Let me fry him--

16:58.710 --> 17:00.080
uh, "try" him.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.920
Hey, somebody's
got to defend me.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.580
-All: Not me!
-Eenie, meenie, miney...

17:05.580 --> 17:09.620
Lucky, I appoint you
his public defender.

17:09.620 --> 17:12.000
But I think
he's guilty too.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.330
Perfect!

17:14.620 --> 17:17.830
-Yeah, looks to me like...
-Definitely guilty!

17:17.830 --> 17:21.500
-Order! Order in the court.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.290
Quiet that unruly mob,
bailiff!

17:24.290 --> 17:27.080
Uh, Your Honor,
that's the jury.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.460
-I think definitely guilty.
-Yeah, I agree.

17:29.460 --> 17:33.920
-Well, at least they haven't
formed any opinions.

17:33.920 --> 17:36.040
First witness!

17:36.040 --> 17:39.000
I call the guilty guy
to the stand.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.880
Judge:
That's you, Mooch.

17:44.670 --> 17:47.880
Where were you
on the night of October 14th?

17:47.880 --> 17:50.710
How would I know?
That's next week.

17:50.710 --> 17:52.710
Oh. Exactly!

17:52.710 --> 17:57.540
And only someone who stole
a daily-affirmation calendar
would know that.

17:57.540 --> 18:00.540
I didn't steal that stuff.
I had no use for it.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.790
Oh, really?

18:02.790 --> 18:07.170
Your Honor,
I request we visit
the scene of the crime.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.380
As you can see,

18:09.380 --> 18:12.920
the TV was dragged
right to Mooch's headquarters,

18:12.920 --> 18:15.250
where he obviously dropped it.

18:15.250 --> 18:18.540
But look at those paw prints.

18:18.540 --> 18:20.460
Spot:
Hmm.

18:20.460 --> 18:24.460
The thief must have
picked up the TV
and kept going.

18:24.460 --> 18:27.080
These aren't my prints.
They're too small.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.790
Tell us, Curly,

18:32.790 --> 18:35.880
what exactly is your area
of expertise?

18:35.880 --> 18:39.670
Uh, shrinkage,
especially wool.

18:39.670 --> 18:42.380
So some things shrink
when they get wet,

18:42.380 --> 18:44.170
like paw prints.

18:44.170 --> 18:47.040
Mmm, it could happen.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.750
There was dew this morning.

18:48.750 --> 18:52.500
I object! The witness
is not a dirt expert.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.710
Judge:
Side bar.

18:56.290 --> 18:58.880
Ahem. Now I'm not quite sure

18:58.880 --> 19:00.880
as to how to rule on this one.

19:00.880 --> 19:04.000
He might be an expert,
he might not.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.380
Make me an offer.

19:06.380 --> 19:09.540
-A bucket of slop.
-This is unethical.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.620
Two buckets.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.620
Three buckets
and a corn fritter.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.500
Sold!
He ain't nothing
but an expert.

19:15.500 --> 19:17.500
Next witness.

19:17.500 --> 19:21.960
So you say Mooch was with you
when the crimes took place.

19:21.960 --> 19:25.880
He couldn't have stolen the TV
or the other missing stuff.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.250
Right?

19:27.250 --> 19:29.000
Uh, right.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.960
Your witness.

19:30.960 --> 19:34.460
Hmm. Who were you with
when the crimes took place?

19:34.460 --> 19:36.580
Oh, I, uh...

19:36.580 --> 19:39.290
I-- I, uh...

19:39.290 --> 19:40.790
It was him!

19:42.750 --> 19:44.830
It was him! Him, him!

19:44.830 --> 19:49.420
I was with him!

19:53.120 --> 19:56.170
And, uh,
what were you two doing?

19:56.170 --> 19:57.750
Um...

19:57.750 --> 20:00.080
don't tell me.
I know this one.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.580
-Um...

20:02.580 --> 20:06.250
Oh, yeah.
We were stealing
from the pantry.

20:06.250 --> 20:09.790
Um, Nanny left
the kitchen door open

20:09.790 --> 20:12.960
so we helped ourselves!

20:15.880 --> 20:18.290
So Mooch stole
from the pantry,

20:18.290 --> 20:20.380
but he didn't steal
from anybody else?

20:20.380 --> 20:23.170
Ha!
I rest my case.

20:23.170 --> 20:25.330
Me too.

20:25.330 --> 20:27.620
Who am I kidding?
He's guilty.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.920
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

20:29.920 --> 20:32.290
All:
Guilty! Guilty!

20:32.290 --> 20:34.670
Oh, I can't decide.

20:34.670 --> 20:36.880
He looks guilty,
but looks can be deceiving.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.710
I think he looks cute.

20:38.710 --> 20:41.920
11 out of 12.
Close enough.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.620
It's starting!

20:43.620 --> 20:45.670
Run for your lives!

20:45.670 --> 20:48.210
There's no time to lose!
Go, go, go!

20:57.710 --> 20:59.710
-Lucky: The TV!
-Rolly: My cans!

20:59.710 --> 21:02.250
-My calendar!
-Hey!

21:02.250 --> 21:03.750
All our stuff is here.

21:03.750 --> 21:05.670
You stole it!

21:05.670 --> 21:07.880
I didn't steal anything.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.790
I commandeered it
for our survival

21:09.790 --> 21:12.290
during the great
cat invasion.

21:16.540 --> 21:19.710
TV for civil-defense warnings,
cans for food storage,

21:19.710 --> 21:22.250
calendar to keep track
of the long days in hiding,

21:22.250 --> 21:24.380
dog whistles
to send signals,

21:24.380 --> 21:26.620
pink bow to designate
the girls' hydrant,

21:26.620 --> 21:28.170
and wigs for camouflage.

21:28.170 --> 21:29.670
That's Cruella's.

21:29.670 --> 21:31.920
Aha!
Gimme, gimme!

21:31.920 --> 21:34.790
Only thing we don't have
is a water canon.

21:34.790 --> 21:38.330
Never did find it.
Cat spies must have taken it.

21:40.250 --> 21:43.040
Mmm.

21:43.040 --> 21:47.420
I think we can
all learn something
from today's affirmation.

21:47.420 --> 21:50.710
"When a wrong is committed,
don't rush to judgment."

21:50.710 --> 21:52.750
Sorry we didn't believe you,
Mooch.

21:52.750 --> 21:55.830
Oh, wait, that was
yesterday's affirmation.

21:55.830 --> 21:57.460
Today's is,

21:57.460 --> 21:59.670
"When a really big wrong
is committed,

21:59.670 --> 22:03.420
find the jerk
who did it and pound him
into moose meal."

22:03.420 --> 22:05.580
Pug! Get him!

22:05.580 --> 22:07.750
All:
There he is!
Don't let him get away!
