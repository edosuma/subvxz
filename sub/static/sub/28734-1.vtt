05:23.000 --> 05:24.832
<i>On your way home
from work, you stop</i>

05:24.834 --> 05:26.434
<i>at the shopping mall
to pick up some dinner.</i>

05:26.436 --> 05:29.136
As you walk past a restaurant,
you catch a glimpse

05:29.138 --> 05:32.206
of your partner
with another man or woman.

05:32.208 --> 05:34.576
They are kissing publicly
and very passionately.

05:34.578 --> 05:36.810
Up until this moment,
you believed your relationship

05:36.812 --> 05:38.278
was stable, loving
and committed.

05:38.280 --> 05:41.148
A. I don't feel angry at all.

05:41.150 --> 05:43.149
B. I feel slightly annoyed.

05:43.151 --> 05:45.453
C. I feel moderately angry.

05:45.455 --> 05:47.087
D. I feel very angry.

05:47.089 --> 05:49.356
E. I feel furious.

05:59.967 --> 06:02.234
At a karaoke night,
your friends...

06:08.442 --> 06:10.843
Yeah.

06:10.845 --> 06:12.413
I know.

06:16.117 --> 06:18.084
Let's do it differently.

06:19.152 --> 06:24.589
Um, let me be more specific.

06:24.591 --> 06:27.426
You've been in isolation
in Ely State Prison,

06:27.428 --> 06:29.260
and you've just been
transferred here,

06:29.262 --> 06:31.895
back into isolation again.

06:31.897 --> 06:34.100
What do you think about that?

06:38.037 --> 06:40.871
As I said, this is your
pre-classification meeting

06:40.873 --> 06:43.373
so that we can discover what
options are available to you

06:43.375 --> 06:46.577
as you enter back
into the general population.

06:46.579 --> 06:49.346
Is there a vocation
you're interested in?

06:49.348 --> 06:53.085
Would you like to resume
your education?

06:56.554 --> 07:00.356
It's just... it's real easy
to get lost in the system.

07:00.358 --> 07:02.591
Especially when you come
into a new facility

07:02.593 --> 07:05.596
and, you know,
you're not from around here.

07:10.501 --> 07:13.935
I'm just trying to find out
what's important to you.

07:13.937 --> 07:15.970
Is your freedom
important to you?

07:15.972 --> 07:18.108
Is that something
you think about?

07:21.379 --> 07:24.512
Are you listening
to me at all, Mr. Coleman?

07:24.514 --> 07:26.046
Yeah.

07:26.048 --> 07:27.382
Yeah, what?
Yeah, you're listening?

07:27.384 --> 07:29.084
Or, yeah, your freedom's
important to you?

07:29.086 --> 07:31.218
- I'm listening.
- Okay. Thank you.

07:31.220 --> 07:33.021
- Just get me back there.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

07:33.023 --> 07:34.456
What?

07:34.458 --> 07:35.557
It's okay. Thank you.

07:35.559 --> 07:37.224
Sit down!

07:37.226 --> 07:40.329
Sit down. Sit down!

07:44.265 --> 07:46.966
I get it... you feel like
you have no control in here.

07:46.968 --> 07:49.268
I get it.
I understand that.

07:49.270 --> 07:51.638
I am giving you some control.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.373
That's what this is.

07:53.375 --> 07:55.441
And like it or not,
you're gonna be reintegrated

07:55.443 --> 07:56.976
into the general population.

07:56.978 --> 07:59.414
Mm, I'm not good with people.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.551
All right.

08:10.458 --> 08:13.625
I can get you into the outdoor
maintenance program, then.

08:13.627 --> 08:16.027
And while you're there,
you'll have the opportunity

08:16.029 --> 08:18.563
to reflect on
where you want to be.

08:21.468 --> 08:24.468
- Can I go now?
- Yep.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.506
Open D wing!

08:38.719 --> 08:40.717
Pop 3.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.636
Want one?

09:28.765 --> 09:31.164
There you go, boy.

09:31.166 --> 09:33.267
Attaboy.

09:46.148 --> 09:48.113
Here you go.

09:48.115 --> 09:50.251
Start with this pile
right here.

09:51.553 --> 09:53.052
You kidding me?

09:53.054 --> 09:54.688
No, man.
When you get done with it,

09:54.690 --> 09:56.388
put it in that pile over there.

09:56.390 --> 09:58.525
What, you in charge here?

09:58.527 --> 10:00.759
Yeah, I'm the chief
of shit-shoveling.

10:00.761 --> 10:03.264
Get for it. Get busy.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.111
All right. Let's go.

11:11.795 --> 11:13.628
Pop 3.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.243
You smell like shit.

14:10.664 --> 14:12.831
What the hell
are you doing in there?

14:12.833 --> 14:14.601
Get out now!

14:17.336 --> 14:19.336
You never go in there.

14:19.338 --> 14:21.473
That's a dangerous animal.

14:21.475 --> 14:23.841
Don't ever fuck with him.

14:23.843 --> 14:25.876
You have a name?
What's your name?

14:25.878 --> 14:28.612
Roman.

14:28.614 --> 14:31.014
Well, Roman,

14:31.016 --> 14:34.685
I don't need my yard
and my lawn fertilized.

14:34.687 --> 14:37.020
So why don't you just take
your wheelbarrow

14:37.022 --> 14:40.423
and your pitchfork,
and get rid of all this shit.

15:07.885 --> 15:10.320
Coleman, visitor.

15:30.639 --> 15:33.406
All right. Very, very good.

15:33.408 --> 15:35.577
Good.

15:44.119 --> 15:45.819
Who the hell are you?

15:45.821 --> 15:47.521
I'm over here.

15:52.593 --> 15:55.027
Over here. Very good.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.731
Very cool.

15:59.733 --> 16:03.635
And, uh, maybe just one
of you two, please.

16:06.773 --> 16:08.640
Okay, I love it.

16:08.642 --> 16:11.045
There you go. Okay.

16:13.713 --> 16:15.646
Okay.

16:15.648 --> 16:17.014
All right.

16:17.016 --> 16:19.649
And one of you two, please.

16:29.628 --> 16:31.530
Why are you here?

16:32.966 --> 16:35.065
All right.

16:35.067 --> 16:37.167
- Very good.
- Thank you.

16:37.169 --> 16:39.805
I just need you to sign this.

16:40.873 --> 16:42.571
Thank you.

16:42.573 --> 16:44.776
Very, very nice.

16:48.646 --> 16:50.479
A little bit closer.

16:50.481 --> 16:53.582
All right. Very, very good.

16:53.584 --> 16:54.884
Good.

16:54.886 --> 16:56.518
Don't come back here.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.621
Very good.

16:58.623 --> 17:00.588
Very good. Thank you.

17:00.590 --> 17:02.558
Good day.

17:02.560 --> 17:04.493
And, uh, all right.

17:07.130 --> 17:08.864
<i>Okay, guys.</i>

17:08.866 --> 17:11.531
Now, is everybody ready?

17:11.534 --> 17:12.901
Yes, boss.

17:12.903 --> 17:15.536
'Cause this one
is particularly crazed.

17:15.538 --> 17:17.005
All right.

17:17.007 --> 17:19.006
So be very careful.

17:19.008 --> 17:22.242
And open the gate on three.

17:22.244 --> 17:24.946
One.

17:26.181 --> 17:28.849
Two.

17:28.851 --> 17:30.851
- Three! Let 'er rip!
- All right, here we go!

17:34.489 --> 17:36.489
Goddamn. Son of a bitch.

17:36.491 --> 17:39.159
- Look at him go.
- He's wild, man.

17:39.161 --> 17:40.960
Jesus Christ.

17:42.630 --> 17:44.163
Wyatt Earp right here.

17:44.165 --> 17:45.898
- Come on.
- Goddamn!

17:45.900 --> 17:47.600
Look at that Wyatt Earp shit.

17:47.602 --> 17:49.235
Come on, now.

17:52.707 --> 17:55.006
How long you been
standing here?

17:55.008 --> 17:56.575
Huh?

17:56.577 --> 17:58.510
I'm talking to you.
Yeah, right.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.078
How long you been here?

18:00.080 --> 18:02.013
Okay, your turn. Come on.

18:02.015 --> 18:04.849
You... you can make a sound,
right? You can speak?

18:04.851 --> 18:07.152
- Yeah, I can.
- Okay. What's your name?

18:07.154 --> 18:09.721
I told you, sir,
it's, uh, Coleman Roman.

18:09.723 --> 18:12.690
Coleman Roman is your name?

18:12.692 --> 18:14.693
That's a joke, right?

18:16.662 --> 18:19.296
Shut up, Henry.
It's not funny.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.635
He's got a name.
It's just backwards.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.135
You ever ridden a horse?

18:25.137 --> 18:27.905
- No, sir.
- 5:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.605
- No, I'm just here for mainten...
- Right?

18:29.607 --> 18:30.907
I'm just here
for maintenance, sir.

18:30.909 --> 18:33.776
No, sir, you're not here
for maintenance.

18:33.778 --> 18:37.780
You're here to do
what I decide you're gonna do.

18:37.782 --> 18:40.016
And here's the drill.

18:40.018 --> 18:43.552
If you can stay in there
for more than five seconds,

18:43.554 --> 18:45.490
you're in the program.

18:46.758 --> 18:49.226
Get it? You're in charge.

18:50.328 --> 18:52.594
Get him fed, get him watered,

18:52.596 --> 18:54.763
and get him calmed down.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.967
Your boots, Mr. Coleman.

19:00.237 --> 19:02.036
Yeah, they go on your feet.

19:05.775 --> 19:07.208
Fellas, fellas, fellas,

19:07.210 --> 19:08.844
good morning,
good morning, good morning.

19:08.846 --> 19:10.278
Just in time. What up?

19:10.280 --> 19:11.746
- What's up?
- Mikey.

19:11.748 --> 19:13.247
How you feeling?
All right?

19:13.249 --> 19:15.250
Uh-huh. Good morning.
Good morning, good morning.

19:15.252 --> 19:16.817
Hey, hey.

19:18.754 --> 19:20.154
What up? What up? What's up?

19:20.156 --> 19:21.889
All right, fellas.
What's going on, Elijah?

19:21.891 --> 19:23.957
- Hey, man, what's up? How you been?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:23.959 --> 19:26.193
- Top of the morning.
- Ah, ah, ah, got the boots on.

19:26.195 --> 19:28.229
Oh, yeah, don't worry.
You'll get used to it, man.

19:28.231 --> 19:30.130
Nice boots.

19:30.132 --> 19:32.333
Pop your cherry today, homeboy.
Walking a little funny?

19:32.335 --> 19:33.900
It's definitely not
their first rodeo.

19:35.704 --> 19:37.770
- Whoo! Cute in that orange.
- Fucking with you, man.

19:37.772 --> 19:39.172
He's fucking with you.

19:39.174 --> 19:40.940
The whole purpose
of this program

19:40.942 --> 19:43.242
is to learn how to break
these wild horses

19:43.244 --> 19:45.278
and turn them into
some horse of value

19:45.280 --> 19:48.080
that can be auctioned off
in the next 12 weeks.

19:48.082 --> 19:50.250
Pays to keep
this program running,

19:50.252 --> 19:52.284
and ultimately...

19:52.286 --> 19:54.286
our rehabilitation.

19:54.288 --> 19:57.691
And ironically enough,
the police buy most of them.

19:59.293 --> 20:01.726
That horse is crazy, man.

20:01.728 --> 20:03.996
Yo, he's
spooking out right now.

20:03.998 --> 20:05.863
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

20:05.865 --> 20:08.668
Why don't you ask him?
You ready?

20:12.405 --> 20:14.972
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:14.974 --> 20:16.374
Get back.

20:16.376 --> 20:18.242
Hey, listen up.

20:18.244 --> 20:21.379
'Cause I'm the best trainer
in here.

20:21.381 --> 20:23.013
See this?

20:23.015 --> 20:24.915
This is your hand.

20:24.917 --> 20:27.117
You always want
to control your hand.

20:27.119 --> 20:30.353
What you want to do
is find an opening, you know?

20:30.355 --> 20:32.222
Get him going.

20:32.224 --> 20:34.324
Hey, hey. You just want
to get him going.

20:34.326 --> 20:37.026
And make sure you stay
in the center.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.261
All right?

20:38.263 --> 20:40.863
Make him move around you.
Come on.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.865
Now, normally,
when you start a new horse,

20:43.867 --> 20:47.369
you can keep him right along
the fence like he is right now.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.338
Because they're trying to keep

20:49.340 --> 20:51.240
as much space as they can
away from you.

20:51.242 --> 20:53.275
All right? Now, the first thing
you want to do

20:53.277 --> 20:54.843
is just establish direction.

20:54.845 --> 20:56.378
Get him going one way,

20:56.380 --> 20:58.780
and then send him
the other way.

20:58.782 --> 21:01.015
And after you get that
down pat,

21:01.017 --> 21:03.452
you can start working
on the hook and the draw.

21:03.454 --> 21:06.054
Or, as I like to call,
the touch.

21:08.358 --> 21:10.425
All right?

21:10.427 --> 21:13.794
Like I said,
respect his space, okay?

21:13.796 --> 21:15.696
And he'll respect yours.

21:15.698 --> 21:18.132
And never look him in the eye.

21:18.134 --> 21:20.103
Get your ass in here.

21:24.240 --> 21:27.243
Come on, man.
We ain't got all fucking day.

21:37.851 --> 21:40.321
Don't forget the stick.

21:41.956 --> 21:43.889
All right.

21:43.891 --> 21:46.994
Whenever you're ready,
Roman Coleman.

21:59.940 --> 22:01.473
Hips, Roman.

22:01.475 --> 22:03.308
- Yeah, what about 'em?
- Your shit is tight.

22:03.310 --> 22:05.310
You need to loosen it up
a little bit

22:05.312 --> 22:07.411
if you want to connect
with him, all right?

22:07.413 --> 22:10.515
I bet you don't have
one good fucking dance move.

22:13.052 --> 22:14.818
Oh, this is gonna be
fucking great.

22:14.820 --> 22:16.086
Where you going?

22:16.088 --> 22:17.887
- Where you going?
- All right, look.

22:17.889 --> 22:19.290
Drop the stick.
Fuck the stick.

22:19.292 --> 22:21.258
Put your hands up. All right?

22:21.260 --> 22:23.826
Establish a boundary.

22:23.828 --> 22:25.363
Now, tell your horse
to back off.

22:28.066 --> 22:29.768
Back off.

22:31.102 --> 22:32.436
With your body.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.437
Back off.
Back the fuck off.

22:34.439 --> 22:37.139
You're acting like a bitch right now, Roman.

22:37.141 --> 22:39.377
- Tell him to back off.
- Back off.

22:41.413 --> 22:43.045
Back off.

22:43.047 --> 22:44.780
With your body, Roman.
Come on.

22:44.782 --> 22:46.449
Come on, back the fuck off!

22:50.422 --> 22:52.888
It's good, Roman Coleman,

22:52.890 --> 22:54.456
but if you want
to control your horse,

22:54.458 --> 22:56.425
first you got to control yourself.

22:56.427 --> 22:58.393
Yeah, you be the boss.
You got it, Roman.

22:58.395 --> 22:59.994
Come on, get over there.

22:59.996 --> 23:01.529
Just keep working
on them dance moves. Hips.

23:01.531 --> 23:02.930
Go over there.

23:02.932 --> 23:04.165
Go over there, man.

23:04.167 --> 23:06.534
Yeah, come on, move it.

23:06.536 --> 23:08.936
- There you go.
- Come on.

23:08.938 --> 23:11.105
You're really not that bad
for a first-timer.

23:11.107 --> 23:12.872
I'm actually
pretty proud of you.

23:12.874 --> 23:14.108
I looked up,
and that motherfucker

23:14.110 --> 23:15.309
just run straight over me.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.043
Then I look back up, and I got

23:17.045 --> 23:18.812
15 horse cocks swinging
in my fucking face.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.814
'Cause you actually have to be
on the horse, man.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.182
You spend more time
on the ground

23:22.184 --> 23:23.383
than you do on your horse.

23:23.385 --> 23:24.917
Fuck you, Tom.

23:24.919 --> 23:26.219
Have you seen T-Bird?

23:26.221 --> 23:27.954
That motherfucker's
a maniac, bro.

23:27.956 --> 23:31.591
He's not one of the lazy,
squishy, donkey types.

23:31.593 --> 23:33.193
- Man, I'm telling you...
- What, man?

23:33.195 --> 23:34.461
I'm just listening.

23:34.463 --> 23:35.863
Hey, what's your name again?

23:36.897 --> 23:38.231
Roman.

23:38.233 --> 23:40.467
Oh, you got
the new horse, right?

23:40.469 --> 23:42.501
Yeah.

23:42.503 --> 23:44.371
Oh, the new horse!

23:46.374 --> 23:48.906
Uh-huh, hell yeah, when I
first saw T-Bird, I was like,

23:48.908 --> 23:51.477
"I pity the fool that gotta
ride that motherfucker."

23:51.479 --> 23:53.144
- Happened to be me.
- Time's up.

23:53.146 --> 23:54.879
Come on, man.

23:54.881 --> 23:56.914
You know we got like
three more minutes in here.

23:56.916 --> 23:58.216
You're done. Time's up.

23:58.218 --> 23:59.452
- Let's go!
- All right, all right.

24:21.206 --> 24:23.208
What you looking at, man?

24:24.909 --> 24:27.544
All you need to be looking at
is them hips, shoulders,

24:27.546 --> 24:29.546
hips, shoulders,
hips, shoulders.

24:31.316 --> 24:34.185
Work on them dance moves, man.
You'll be all right.

24:47.264 --> 24:48.963
Hey, Indian. What's up?

24:48.965 --> 24:50.466
- Hey.
- Hey there.

24:50.468 --> 24:51.634
- Hey.
- What up, man?

24:51.636 --> 24:53.001
How you feeling?
Any better?

24:53.003 --> 24:54.369
- Ah, what up, dawg?
- What up?

24:54.371 --> 24:56.073
- What up, fellas?
- Yo, G.

24:57.374 --> 24:59.441
Yo, watch my back.

25:22.331 --> 25:24.299
That's a soldier, too.

25:27.370 --> 25:29.371
He got the crazy eye.

25:46.654 --> 25:48.653
There we go.

25:57.631 --> 26:00.431
I already signed that.

26:01.634 --> 26:03.637
You forgot to initial.

26:05.104 --> 26:06.604
All right, you two.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.305
Uh, now, don't look

26:08.307 --> 26:11.342
at the camera, but look
at my finger over here.

26:11.344 --> 26:13.345
All right.

26:15.481 --> 26:17.514
Very good. Thank you.

26:17.516 --> 26:20.384
Emancipation?
What the fuck is that?

26:20.386 --> 26:23.186
I found a job,
I have a boyfriend,

26:23.188 --> 26:25.120
and I'm ready to leave.

26:25.122 --> 26:26.458
Just sign.

26:37.134 --> 26:39.101
My boyfriend's a mechanic.

26:39.103 --> 26:41.136
He's opening up a garage
in Atlanta,

26:41.138 --> 26:43.505
and I'm gonna work there
as a receptionist.

26:43.507 --> 26:45.174
Hey there.

26:45.176 --> 26:48.278
Would you guys like
your photo taken today?

26:49.446 --> 26:51.713
Yeah, sure.
That'd be great.

26:51.715 --> 26:54.315
- No, not really, man.
- Yeah, it'd be great.

26:54.317 --> 26:55.550
Thank you.

26:55.552 --> 26:57.353
All right, come with me.

27:00.723 --> 27:02.390
Come with me.

27:02.392 --> 27:04.358
Come on, Dad.

27:10.767 --> 27:14.201
If you're all set,
then why you need this?

27:14.203 --> 27:16.203
I'm selling Grandma's house
in Bakersfield,

27:16.205 --> 27:19.104
but I can't unless you sign.

27:19.106 --> 27:20.574
All right, now,

27:20.576 --> 27:22.142
don't look at the camera.

27:22.144 --> 27:25.144
Just look at my finger
over here.

27:25.146 --> 27:26.746
Okay.

27:26.748 --> 27:28.815
You can even smile if you like.

27:28.817 --> 27:31.116
Take your picture, man.

27:31.118 --> 27:34.487
- You can't sell the house.
- I need to sell the house.

27:34.489 --> 27:36.789
Great.

27:36.791 --> 27:39.525
Just one more.

27:39.527 --> 27:42.227
Hold on.
Uh, maybe you turn

27:42.229 --> 27:44.763
and face each other
a little bit.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.367
- Great.
- Yeah, we're done.

27:49.369 --> 27:51.336
That's a nice one.

27:51.338 --> 27:53.738
I need the money
to raise this baby.

27:53.740 --> 27:56.274
Oh, so he got a daddy?

27:56.276 --> 27:58.676
Well, I ain't the Virgin Mary.

27:58.678 --> 28:02.080
So, why doesn't he take care
of the baby, then?

28:04.216 --> 28:07.754
What do you know about
taking care of a baby?

28:09.421 --> 28:12.658
What do you know about
taking care of anything?

28:14.560 --> 28:16.693
- That house is mine.
- Lower your voice.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.495
It belongs to me.
Grandma left it to me.

28:19.497 --> 28:22.265
No, she left it to us.

28:22.267 --> 28:24.200
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:24.202 --> 28:27.169
And you need it here?

28:27.171 --> 28:29.772
Here, where your clothes
are washed,

28:29.774 --> 28:33.109
your meals are served.

28:33.111 --> 28:35.243
You have a bed.

28:35.245 --> 28:36.812
Shit, you're even tan.

28:36.814 --> 28:38.781
You're a dependent
of the state,

28:38.783 --> 28:40.850
and it's like you're on
permanent fucking vacation.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.052
Shut the fuck up!

28:50.627 --> 28:54.261
Yeah, I think you'd marry
that horse if you could.

28:54.263 --> 28:55.897
Don't worry, homey.
Your secret's safe with me.

28:55.899 --> 28:58.499
You should've seen him propose earlier, man.

28:58.501 --> 29:01.335
Hey, I think you already got
engaged, homey, straight up.

29:03.506 --> 29:05.508
Whoa, someone's mad.

29:06.642 --> 29:08.342
Roman.

29:08.344 --> 29:10.611
Hey, Roman!

29:10.613 --> 29:12.447
Roman!

29:15.418 --> 29:17.650
You know, riding a mustang,

29:17.652 --> 29:19.519
that's the easy part.

29:19.521 --> 29:21.654
The hard part is...

29:21.656 --> 29:25.390
getting your hands on him
in the first place.

29:25.392 --> 29:27.329
Isn't that right, Coleman?

29:28.830 --> 29:30.930
Why don't you come on over here

29:30.932 --> 29:33.298
and get in there
and calm him down.

29:33.300 --> 29:36.270
- I'm not getting in there.
- Do it.

29:37.639 --> 29:40.405
And not only do it;
get it done.

29:40.407 --> 29:41.609
Go.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.119
Don't forget your stick.

29:58.257 --> 30:00.727
Soon as he turns around,
you get in there.

30:05.430 --> 30:08.234
Come on. Come on.

30:10.970 --> 30:12.704
Now, get his attention.

30:14.473 --> 30:17.641
Behave yourself.

30:17.643 --> 30:19.844
Push him back.

30:25.516 --> 30:27.617
Hang in there, Roman.
You're doing great.

30:27.619 --> 30:28.852
Come on.

30:28.854 --> 30:30.285
Yeah, that's it.

30:30.287 --> 30:31.788
Come on, you stop now.

30:31.790 --> 30:34.423
Yeah, come here.
Come here.

30:34.425 --> 30:36.391
- Come here. You stop.
- Come on, Coleman.

30:36.393 --> 30:37.558
- Block him up.
- You stop. You stop!

30:37.560 --> 30:38.861
- Stop it!
- Oh!

30:38.863 --> 30:41.596
You got game, son.
Hang in there with him.

30:43.801 --> 30:45.000
- Get out of there, bro!
- Get out of there!

30:45.002 --> 30:46.001
Get out of there!

30:52.742 --> 30:54.441
What are you doing?!

30:56.312 --> 30:58.780
Jesus Christ.
What the hell are you doing?!

30:58.782 --> 31:01.248
Just get out of there!

31:02.652 --> 31:05.519
- Back off! Back off!
- Get him out of there!

31:07.489 --> 31:09.456
Back off!

31:09.458 --> 31:12.458
Thomas!

31:12.460 --> 31:14.928
Bring the ketamine
and tranquilize him!

31:14.930 --> 31:17.365
Coleman, can you breathe?

31:18.866 --> 31:20.934
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

31:20.936 --> 31:22.601
Man, come on!

31:22.603 --> 31:24.303
Esme at the horse program.

31:24.305 --> 31:26.807
I never want to see
your goddamn face again.

32:05.444 --> 32:07.644
Psst.

32:07.646 --> 32:09.982
Psst, psst, psst, psst.

32:11.951 --> 32:13.753
Shit.

32:31.034 --> 32:33.570
And walk.

32:42.913 --> 32:44.446
Come on, Coleman, get up.

32:44.448 --> 32:46.549
I got a cellblock to feed.

34:35.619 --> 34:37.420
Psst.

34:49.498 --> 34:51.167
What do you want?

34:52.936 --> 34:55.904
- A magazine.
- I got you.

34:55.906 --> 34:59.074
No, no, no, not like that.

35:21.696 --> 35:24.930
Marquis. Marquis.

35:40.047 --> 35:42.013
That's it, that's it.

35:42.015 --> 35:43.650
Come on.

35:45.085 --> 35:47.718
Yeah, good boy.
Good boy.

35:47.720 --> 35:49.688
Now, come with me.

35:49.690 --> 35:51.557
Come with me. Come on.

35:52.625 --> 35:55.259
That's it. That's it.

35:55.261 --> 35:56.827
That's it.

35:56.829 --> 36:00.197
Now, don't come here.
Don't come here.

36:00.199 --> 36:02.134
And stop.

36:03.769 --> 36:05.601
Okay, get back there.

36:05.603 --> 36:07.838
Get back there. Come on.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.839
<i>Coleman, out of bed.</i>

36:09.841 --> 36:12.208
Come on, man. Hurry up.

36:12.210 --> 36:14.111
- What's going on?
- Get dressed.

36:14.113 --> 36:15.945
Nasty thunderstorm
seven miles out.

36:15.947 --> 36:18.716
Need all the riders we can get.
Let's go.

36:28.259 --> 36:31.226
- Mikey!
- We gotta get control on this side!

36:34.865 --> 36:36.597
Watch out!

36:38.702 --> 36:40.035
Get that horse
out of that pen over there.

36:40.037 --> 36:41.569
Hey, knot the fences.
Knot the fences.

36:41.571 --> 36:43.839
The horses...
they could hurt themselves!

36:49.679 --> 36:52.847
- Get 'em out. Get 'em out.
- Get 'em out.

36:52.849 --> 36:55.752
Come on, get them out of here!

37:03.859 --> 37:06.128
Okay. Easy.

37:07.330 --> 37:09.662
Calm down.

37:11.899 --> 37:13.535
Easy.

37:21.709 --> 37:23.776
Come here.

37:25.313 --> 37:27.114
Come here.

37:32.186 --> 37:34.186
Easy.

37:34.188 --> 37:36.723
Yeah.

37:43.330 --> 37:45.229
Come on. Yeah, that's it.

37:53.906 --> 37:56.340
That's it.

37:56.342 --> 37:57.776
Come on.

37:59.711 --> 38:02.047
Come on. Easy. Easy.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.116
Hey. Hey!

38:06.118 --> 38:08.251
- Come on, get bridles on them and get them out!
- Come on.

38:16.428 --> 38:20.029
Let's walk them down
to the kitchen.

38:29.773 --> 38:32.174
All right, fellas,
let's make some room in here.

38:32.176 --> 38:34.409
Try to get as many horses
in here as we can.

38:38.382 --> 38:41.015
- Hey, hey!
- Mikey!

38:41.017 --> 38:43.083
Can somebody bring
an extra halter?

38:43.085 --> 38:45.420
I'm right here, okay? Easy.

38:54.163 --> 38:56.797
Tom, you okay?

38:56.799 --> 38:57.865
Mikey, you okay?

39:03.038 --> 39:04.804
Stop that. Stop that.

39:04.806 --> 39:06.139
Don't do that.

39:06.141 --> 39:08.475
- Stop that. Stop that.
- Move back!

39:08.477 --> 39:10.109
Henry!

39:11.946 --> 39:14.213
No.

39:16.817 --> 39:18.351
Henry, get back!

39:24.825 --> 39:27.161
Yo, back off!

39:39.805 --> 39:41.405
I got you.

39:41.407 --> 39:43.275
Jesus Christ.

39:43.277 --> 39:45.209
Yeah, he's straight now.

39:45.211 --> 39:47.178
All right,
it's good, man, it's good.

39:47.180 --> 39:50.216
- You all right?
- Straight.

40:07.466 --> 40:08.932
- There?
- Yeah, right there.

40:08.934 --> 40:10.866
All right.

40:17.208 --> 40:19.944
You're all right, yeah.

40:22.479 --> 40:24.747
You're all right, pal. Relax.

40:25.983 --> 40:27.451
Coleman.

40:34.090 --> 40:35.992
You're back.

40:38.495 --> 40:41.928
If you ever hit another horse,

40:41.930 --> 40:46.367
I'm gonna see you do ten years
in a psychiatric ward.

40:46.369 --> 40:49.403
- You got that?
- I do, sir. Thank you.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.507
You earned that.

40:53.508 --> 40:56.444
We got four weeks
before the auction.

40:56.446 --> 40:59.414
Let's see if you
and your horse can catch up.

42:28.165 --> 42:31.435
- How's your horse?
- Doing all right.

42:34.104 --> 42:37.374
Them Latinos is running into us
later today, homey.

42:52.521 --> 42:54.554
Yeah, price is gonna blow up

42:54.556 --> 42:56.256
- at that auction, man!
- Ah, yeah!

42:56.258 --> 42:57.990
Hey, come on,
give T-Bird a kick.

42:59.394 --> 43:01.994
Oh, damn!

43:03.631 --> 43:06.064
You want to be top seller, huh?

43:08.169 --> 43:10.169
- And he can still cha-cha.
- All right, all right.

43:10.171 --> 43:11.637
That's what I'm talking about.

43:11.639 --> 43:13.506
That's right, homey.
Do the Macarena.

43:21.048 --> 43:22.649
Hey, bud.

43:27.388 --> 43:29.155
It's me.

43:44.604 --> 43:46.504
Come on.

43:46.506 --> 43:48.640
Ah, what the fuck?

43:51.209 --> 43:54.144
Look like somebody mad
at you today, huh?

43:54.146 --> 43:56.680
Ah, he won't listen.
He won't let me approach him.

43:56.682 --> 43:59.749
I wouldn't let you approach me,
either, motherfucker.

44:01.754 --> 44:05.055
All right, cowboy, look.
Jump in the middle.

44:10.695 --> 44:12.628
It's real simple.

44:12.630 --> 44:15.431
When both ears pointing
one way, to the front,

44:15.433 --> 44:17.332
he's happy.

44:17.334 --> 44:19.635
When they're both pointing
to the back, he ain't so happy.

44:19.637 --> 44:21.236
You see his ears?

44:21.238 --> 44:23.672
Well, just tell me
what to do, all right?

44:23.674 --> 44:26.542
You got to be patient, man.

44:26.544 --> 44:30.213
You got to be patient if you
want to get your hands on him.

44:34.017 --> 44:36.216
It's a real nice horse
you got here, man.

44:36.218 --> 44:38.286
What'd you name him?

44:38.288 --> 44:39.787
I haven't named him yet.

44:39.789 --> 44:42.522
Everybody need a name, Roman.

44:42.524 --> 44:45.595
It might be the reason he's not
coming when you call him.

44:49.766 --> 44:54.366
I read something about a guy
who could gallop so slow

44:54.368 --> 44:57.172
it took him an hour
to go 300 yards.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.473
That's the whole story?

45:00.475 --> 45:02.041
That's slower
than that mule over there.

45:02.043 --> 45:03.342
- That's very unimpressive.
- No, no, no.

45:03.344 --> 45:05.979
It's about
controlling strength.

45:07.816 --> 45:10.749
He was using silk reins.

45:10.751 --> 45:12.551
- Silk rein?
- Yeah.

45:12.553 --> 45:14.186
Okay.

45:14.188 --> 45:16.254
Guy's name was Marquis.

45:18.725 --> 45:21.560
Look alive.
We got happy ears.

45:21.562 --> 45:23.695
Marquis.

45:23.697 --> 45:25.431
Now that you figured
that part out,

45:25.433 --> 45:28.500
you might as well go ahead
and jump in the middle.

45:28.502 --> 45:30.668
All right?
Be on his time.

45:30.670 --> 45:32.670
And remember what I told you
about your shoulders?

45:32.672 --> 45:35.405
You got to loosen up.
You got to loosen up.

45:36.742 --> 45:38.175
- What's up?
- Hey, what's up, homey?

45:38.177 --> 45:39.577
What's up?

45:39.579 --> 45:42.179
That's what I'm talking about!

45:42.181 --> 45:43.748
Hey, all right.

45:47.853 --> 45:49.786
I think so, boss.

45:49.788 --> 45:51.690
I think so.

46:15.813 --> 46:17.814
You turning your back on me?

46:44.240 --> 46:46.709
All right, come on.

47:11.165 --> 47:13.167
Come on, come on.

47:22.308 --> 47:25.344
Come on. Come on!

47:27.781 --> 47:29.747
Stay there.

47:29.749 --> 47:31.351
All right?

47:32.752 --> 47:34.253
Come on.

47:35.488 --> 47:37.624
Come on.

47:44.831 --> 47:47.766
Come on. Come on!

47:58.509 --> 48:00.277
All right.

48:03.681 --> 48:05.447
All right.
Now, just stay there.

48:07.284 --> 48:08.651
That's it.

48:08.653 --> 48:09.918
That's it. Easy.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.388
Good boy.

48:12.422 --> 48:13.724
Come on.

48:17.327 --> 48:19.662
I'm tired, man.

48:19.664 --> 48:21.229
You're tired, too.

48:21.231 --> 48:25.268
So, let's... let's do it.

48:26.536 --> 48:29.171
Come on. Please.

48:30.639 --> 48:32.940
Please stay there.

48:32.942 --> 48:34.742
Please, come on.

48:34.744 --> 48:36.443
Come on, please.

48:36.445 --> 48:39.646
Come on, stay there, man!

48:39.648 --> 48:42.484
Just fucking listen to me!

48:44.586 --> 48:46.520
Do you hear me?!

48:46.522 --> 48:49.923
I'm not gonna hurt you!
You hear me?!

48:49.925 --> 48:52.226
You hear me,
you stupid animal?!

49:43.009 --> 49:44.975
Hey, bud.

51:16.830 --> 51:19.499
Where you going?
Hey, stay here.

51:31.110 --> 51:33.443
Oh, my God.

51:33.445 --> 51:35.112
What a business.

51:35.114 --> 51:37.982
But to really get
his attention,

51:37.984 --> 51:40.183
you got to use your hands.

51:42.420 --> 51:44.690
Attaboy, Coleman.
You're getting it.

51:46.124 --> 51:49.492
The horse needs to feel
you and him are in sync.

51:49.494 --> 51:51.862
Whoa.
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.

51:51.864 --> 51:54.096
- Come on, keep going.
- Yeah, man. - All right.

51:54.098 --> 51:56.132
Looking good.

51:56.134 --> 51:58.701
Looks like he's ready to ride.

51:58.703 --> 52:01.971
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

52:01.973 --> 52:04.606
But loosen the rein
on his neck.

52:04.608 --> 52:07.042
- Shh.
- That's good. Right there is perfect.

52:07.044 --> 52:10.778
Right there is perfect.
Keep going. Keep going.

52:10.780 --> 52:13.448
- That's it. It's balance.
- There you go, nice and easy.

52:13.450 --> 52:16.618
It's all about balance
and not getting discouraged.

52:16.620 --> 52:18.720
Good job out there.
Way to stick with it.

52:18.722 --> 52:20.455
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, man.

52:20.457 --> 52:21.956
- Great work, man.
- Thanks.

52:24.160 --> 52:26.094
He thought
I didn't see that shit.

52:26.096 --> 52:27.761
Hey, man, what'd I tell you?

52:27.763 --> 52:29.897
Hips, shoulders,
hips, shoulders, baby.

52:29.899 --> 52:31.465
You still can't fucking dance,

52:31.467 --> 52:33.201
but you might be a cowboy
in no time.

52:33.203 --> 52:34.837
Let me tell you.

52:36.538 --> 52:38.672
You know it won't fucking
kill you to smile, man.

52:38.674 --> 52:41.241
That shit's free.
It don't cost nothing.

52:44.914 --> 52:47.015
Pop 3!

52:53.788 --> 52:55.255
Hey, bud.

52:55.257 --> 52:57.023
How's the farm?

52:57.025 --> 52:58.826
How are you?

53:03.830 --> 53:06.868
I heard somebody's
smuggling the ketamine.

53:09.770 --> 53:12.170
None of my business.

53:12.172 --> 53:14.007
Well, now it is.

53:20.814 --> 53:23.115
Your daughter's real pretty.

53:32.591 --> 53:35.627
We want to taste that dope
on Monday morning.

53:49.574 --> 53:52.110
What's your problem, man?

53:53.144 --> 53:54.811
Huh?

53:54.813 --> 53:56.678
Trying to get sliced up?

53:56.680 --> 53:58.580
What the fuck
you doing that for?

53:58.582 --> 54:00.783
You better stay there, boy.

54:06.156 --> 54:08.623
Stay away from my gang.

54:08.625 --> 54:10.092
Back to the game.

54:10.094 --> 54:11.759
That's right, motherfucker.

54:11.761 --> 54:13.128
- Lift some weights.
- Get out of here.

54:13.130 --> 54:15.230
Come on, man, keep walking.

55:56.928 --> 55:59.027
That's good.

55:59.029 --> 56:00.429
All right, that's it.

56:00.431 --> 56:02.266
Yeah, why's that?

56:05.202 --> 56:06.837
Hmm?

56:10.407 --> 56:13.108
You know that...

56:13.110 --> 56:16.244
at six months,
a fetus can suck its own thumb?

56:16.246 --> 56:18.815
Pretty crazy, ain't it?

56:21.218 --> 56:24.452
Our guys out there
know where your daughter lives.

56:24.454 --> 56:26.789
She wasn't hard to find.

56:32.962 --> 56:35.329
Sleep tight, John Wayne.

56:38.167 --> 56:41.134
The auction's in two weeks.

56:41.136 --> 56:42.835
You got to be ready.

56:44.139 --> 56:46.072
Stay in sync with him.

56:46.074 --> 56:47.473
What?

56:47.475 --> 56:50.476
Stay in sync with him.

56:50.478 --> 56:53.412
If you pull back,
he's gonna stop.

56:53.414 --> 56:56.149
If you spur him, he's gonna go.

56:56.151 --> 56:59.151
- Make up your fucking mind.
- That's it. Come on.

57:03.757 --> 57:04.990
<i>That's it.</i>

57:04.992 --> 57:07.759
Now you got it, goddamn it.

57:07.761 --> 57:09.727
There you go.

57:09.729 --> 57:11.262
There you...

57:11.264 --> 57:13.899
Why-why do you spur him?

57:13.901 --> 57:15.766
Why do you spur him?!

57:15.768 --> 57:19.504
Goddamn it, don't pull his head back!

57:35.987 --> 57:39.055
- That's it.
- That's all?

57:39.057 --> 57:41.790
Yeah. I'm not the only one
doing this.

57:41.792 --> 57:44.793
You're gonna have to wait
a week or two.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.897
That's not gonna work.

57:48.833 --> 57:50.099
<i>Coleman,</i>

57:50.101 --> 57:52.434
stop pulling and pushing.

57:52.436 --> 57:55.037
He doesn't know what message
you're trying to send him...

57:55.039 --> 57:56.472
to stop or go forward.

57:56.474 --> 57:58.207
That's good.
Now, that's it. Stop.

57:58.209 --> 58:00.909
Now go forward.
Move him forward.

58:00.911 --> 58:03.778
Move him forward!

58:03.780 --> 58:05.880
Now you're getting it.

58:05.882 --> 58:07.782
Now you got it.

58:09.886 --> 58:11.385
Straighten up, cowboy.

58:14.458 --> 58:17.926
Now you got it.
Now you got it.

58:19.128 --> 58:21.095
Goddamn it. Who knew?

58:22.831 --> 58:24.532
I got the touch!
I got it!

58:24.534 --> 58:26.100
That's right, Roman.
You got it.

58:26.102 --> 58:28.134
- You see that?
- Go ahead, now.

58:28.136 --> 58:31.374
I got it.

58:32.407 --> 58:34.243
You following me?

58:39.947 --> 58:41.415
All right.

58:46.087 --> 58:47.953
Go there.

58:47.955 --> 58:49.154
Come on.

58:49.156 --> 58:50.758
What did I tell you?
Go there.

58:52.426 --> 58:55.027
Huh? Hey.

58:55.029 --> 58:57.131
Why you not listening to me?

58:58.999 --> 59:00.833
Give me some space.

59:00.835 --> 59:03.034
That's it.
Give me some space.

59:03.036 --> 59:06.272
<i>Welcome to today's
restorative justice session,</i>

59:06.274 --> 59:08.607
otherwise known
as anger management.

59:08.609 --> 59:11.875
I want to commend you all again

59:11.877 --> 59:14.145
for making
the courageous decision

59:14.147 --> 59:17.147
to understand and address

59:17.149 --> 59:20.984
the harm that you caused
the victims of your crimes.

59:20.986 --> 59:24.054
And welcome to our new
participant, Roman Coleman.

59:24.056 --> 59:27.493
Roman, thank you
for making the choice to come.

59:29.894 --> 59:34.431
Today, our goal is
to experience empathy,

59:34.433 --> 59:37.434
to understand the power
of an apology

59:37.436 --> 59:40.271
and to be open to our faults.

59:45.543 --> 59:47.944
Who would like to start?

59:51.449 --> 59:53.982
Remember, this is a safe space.

59:53.984 --> 59:56.853
You guys have already made
a lot of headway here.

01:00:01.124 --> 01:00:04.659
I got, uh, ten years
for manslaughter.

01:00:04.661 --> 01:00:07.462
And how long from
the thought of the crime

01:00:07.464 --> 01:00:09.897
to the actual crime?

01:00:12.935 --> 01:00:16.072
- About a second.
- About a second.

01:00:18.175 --> 01:00:21.542
17 years
for strong-arm robbery.

01:00:21.544 --> 01:00:23.176
18 years.

01:00:23.178 --> 01:00:25.112
For what?

01:00:25.114 --> 01:00:26.647
For first-degree murder.

01:00:26.649 --> 01:00:29.449
Since I was 14.

01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:31.685
And how long from
the thought of the crime

01:00:31.687 --> 01:00:34.120
to the actual crime?

01:00:37.292 --> 01:00:40.126
Just, uh... well...

01:00:40.128 --> 01:00:42.195
just spontaneous.

01:00:42.197 --> 01:00:43.596
Ten seconds.

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:45.933
Five seconds.

01:00:51.138 --> 01:00:53.138
22 seconds.

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.207
About three seconds.

01:00:55.209 --> 01:00:57.478
How long
have you been in prison?

01:01:03.317 --> 01:01:05.349
12 years.

01:01:05.351 --> 01:01:08.018
And how long from
the thought of the crime

01:01:08.020 --> 01:01:10.056
to the actual crime?

01:01:14.327 --> 01:01:16.596
Split second.

01:01:44.021 --> 01:01:45.523
Thanks for coming.

01:01:53.497 --> 01:01:56.066
It was nice
what you wrote to me.

01:02:03.106 --> 01:02:05.141
So, what is it
you want to tell me?

01:02:07.377 --> 01:02:10.278
I'm working outdoors...

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.148
with horses.

01:02:13.216 --> 01:02:15.383
- Horses.
- Yeah.

01:02:15.385 --> 01:02:18.119
The ones you see
on your way in here.

01:02:18.121 --> 01:02:21.154
I'm riding 'em.
I'm training 'em.

01:02:21.156 --> 01:02:24.425
We got this auction thing
coming up next week.

01:02:24.427 --> 01:02:26.426
I'd like you to come.

01:02:26.428 --> 01:02:28.093
Sounds fun.

01:02:28.095 --> 01:02:31.264
I think you'd like him.

01:02:31.266 --> 01:02:34.366
His name is Marquis.
That's my horse.

01:02:34.368 --> 01:02:37.306
You think riding horses
can change anything?

01:02:47.481 --> 01:02:50.316
I want to ask you something.

01:02:50.318 --> 01:02:52.317
Something I don't deserve.

01:02:52.319 --> 01:02:54.121
I know that.

01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:58.058
I want you to hear me out.

01:02:59.493 --> 01:03:01.394
What's that?

01:03:09.335 --> 01:03:11.704
There's so many things...

01:03:15.341 --> 01:03:18.512
...I've been wanting to say
for such a long time.

01:03:26.084 --> 01:03:28.618
I'm not who I used to be. I...

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:31.022
Whatever happened
was an accident.

01:03:40.865 --> 01:03:43.434
I never meant to hurt her.

01:03:46.236 --> 01:03:49.239
And whatever I've done...

01:03:52.843 --> 01:03:56.146
...you'll always be
my-my baby girl.

01:04:01.685 --> 01:04:03.787
I'm listening.

01:04:14.363 --> 01:04:17.232
Come on, sit down. Sit down.

01:04:26.641 --> 01:04:29.578
I-I don't remember everything.

01:04:32.213 --> 01:04:34.413
She flushed...

01:04:34.415 --> 01:04:37.417
my party stuff...

01:04:37.419 --> 01:04:39.719
down the drain.

01:04:41.689 --> 01:04:45.459
She was looking out for me,
and I didn't see it like that.

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.529
She started yelling.

01:04:50.531 --> 01:04:52.396
I started yelling.

01:04:54.535 --> 01:04:57.602
We got into a fight.

01:04:57.604 --> 01:04:59.706
Running around the house.

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:05.712
And she hit me.

01:05:12.185 --> 01:05:14.852
I hit her back.

01:05:14.854 --> 01:05:17.756
I was so angry.

01:05:19.792 --> 01:05:23.830
So I hit her head
against the sink.

01:05:26.565 --> 01:05:29.233
Until her skull cracked.

01:05:31.236 --> 01:05:32.669
I was a kid. I...

01:05:32.671 --> 01:05:34.672
I was a kid.

01:05:36.842 --> 01:05:40.645
You left me alone
to take care of my mom.

01:05:43.214 --> 01:05:47.415
To dress her and feed her
and wipe her ass

01:05:47.417 --> 01:05:50.921
and give her
her medicine every day.

01:05:52.989 --> 01:05:55.392
Do you know what that was like?

01:06:00.965 --> 01:06:03.767
Do you know what that was like?

01:06:09.638 --> 01:06:12.409
I love you.

01:06:14.543 --> 01:06:16.645
I love you so mu...

01:06:19.515 --> 01:06:21.550
You'll never know.

01:06:28.456 --> 01:06:32.591
One day, someday,
I'll make it up to you.

01:06:32.593 --> 01:06:34.562
I promise.

01:08:46.586 --> 01:08:49.487
I just want to say
to all of you,

01:08:49.488 --> 01:08:51.156
we're not training
these horses

01:08:51.158 --> 01:08:54.760
for little kids' birthday
parties and pony rides.

01:08:54.761 --> 01:08:57.161
Some of these horses
are gonna go and protect

01:08:57.162 --> 01:09:00.564
the United States border
down there.

01:09:00.567 --> 01:09:05.402
So you got to get 'em
used to racing and chasing.

01:09:05.404 --> 01:09:07.404
- Got it? - Yes, sir.
- Yes, boss.

01:09:07.406 --> 01:09:09.538
Tell you what, man.
You see my cousin,

01:09:09.541 --> 01:09:12.176
- you run the other way, all right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:12.178 --> 01:09:14.111
Come on,
we're out of here, Thomas.

01:09:39.937 --> 01:09:41.636
Get down!

01:09:41.639 --> 01:09:43.939
Everybody on the
fucking ground now!

01:09:43.941 --> 01:09:46.441
Everybody on
the fucking ground!

01:09:46.443 --> 01:09:48.509
Now! Down, down!

01:09:48.511 --> 01:09:51.578
Everybody down, down!

01:09:51.581 --> 01:09:53.214
- Don't move!
- Face in the dirt!

01:09:54.751 --> 01:09:56.851
Control, I need backup
on the lower yard.

01:09:56.853 --> 01:09:59.621
I got a man down.
I need medical.

01:09:59.623 --> 01:10:01.624
I need backup now.

01:10:02.993 --> 01:10:04.658
Hey, is that Henry, cuz?

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:06.060
- Don't move.
- Shut up!

01:10:06.062 --> 01:10:08.795
Get your face in the dirt!

01:10:08.797 --> 01:10:10.663
Tower, if anybody moves...

01:10:45.666 --> 01:10:47.165
You fucking piece of...

01:10:47.167 --> 01:10:49.136
You fucking piece of shit.

01:10:59.846 --> 01:11:01.179
Guard!

01:12:27.728 --> 01:12:30.032
Spirits never break.

01:12:32.133 --> 01:12:36.302
I don't know
that my spirit's broken,

01:12:36.304 --> 01:12:39.004
but it took a hell
of a beating today,

01:12:39.006 --> 01:12:41.174
I'll tell you that.

01:12:54.954 --> 01:12:56.954
I'll ride his horse.

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.722
Okay.

01:12:58.724 --> 01:13:00.592
Get it done.

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:04.061
Proud to work with you.

01:13:04.063 --> 01:13:06.030
- Good night.
- Night, boss.

01:13:06.032 --> 01:13:07.265
- Night, boss.
- Good night.

01:13:07.267 --> 01:13:09.099
See y'all tomorrow morning.

01:13:09.101 --> 01:13:11.236
We'll ride for Henry.

01:14:14.028 --> 01:14:15.096
Nice.

01:14:16.431 --> 01:14:18.298
Come on.

01:14:39.953 --> 01:14:41.955
You ready?

01:14:43.991 --> 01:14:46.325
Yeah.

01:14:49.429 --> 01:14:52.762
You think she's gonna come?

01:14:52.764 --> 01:14:54.234
Hmm?

01:14:57.802 --> 01:15:00.938
<i>Well, folks,

01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.805

Okay, everybody, get ready.

It's almost showtime.

01:15:13.151 --> 01:15:16.019
In association,

01:15:16.021 --> 01:15:18.288

So give it up for my men.

01:22:56.421 --> 01:22:57.654
Somebody help him!

01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.233
Thomas!

01:23:11.235 --> 01:23:13.402
Thomas, get in there!

01:23:13.404 --> 01:23:14.770
Somebody grab him!

01:23:14.772 --> 01:23:17.539
Get the ketamine
and control him!

01:23:23.581 --> 01:23:26.447
Help me! Help me!

01:23:44.667 --> 01:23:46.600
Yeah.

01:23:47.837 --> 01:23:49.603
I have Coleman here, sir.

01:23:49.605 --> 01:23:52.238
- Bring him in.
- Come on in, Coleman.

01:23:58.947 --> 01:24:01.280
Well, get that shit
off his wrists.

01:24:01.282 --> 01:24:02.715
Yes, sir.

01:24:08.456 --> 01:24:09.789
Thank you, bud.

01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:11.624
You wait outside,
that'd be cool.

01:24:11.626 --> 01:24:12.825
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

01:24:12.827 --> 01:24:14.860
Have a seat.

01:24:16.296 --> 01:24:18.464
See there?

01:24:18.466 --> 01:24:21.299
42 years ago, me in the saddle.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.441
You wanted to see me, sir?

01:24:30.011 --> 01:24:32.378
They're shutting
the program down.

01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.817
I'm really sorry, sir.

01:24:38.985 --> 01:24:41.052
You're sorry?

01:24:41.054 --> 01:24:42.887
Jesus Christ,
don't tell me you're sorry.

01:24:42.889 --> 01:24:45.456
Go out there and tell
your horse you're sorry.

01:24:45.458 --> 01:24:47.891
'Cause when the vet
gets here...

01:24:47.893 --> 01:24:50.060
he's gonna put him down.

01:24:50.062 --> 01:24:53.399
- What are you talking about?
- That surprises you?

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:57.700
You have to remember something.

01:24:57.702 --> 01:25:01.804
I've worked with horses
a long goddamn time.

01:25:01.806 --> 01:25:04.809
And some you can break...

01:25:06.311 --> 01:25:09.546
...and some you can't.

01:25:12.951 --> 01:25:17.254
And you know what else
is a real shame?

01:25:18.522 --> 01:25:20.522
The humpty-dumpty way

01:25:20.524 --> 01:25:22.791
they put that goddamn fence
back together again.

01:25:22.793 --> 01:25:24.826
With adhesive tape.

01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:27.394
Just like on your head...
adhesive tape.

01:25:27.396 --> 01:25:30.934
To mend a fucking fence?
Jesus Christ.

01:26:11.907 --> 01:26:13.539
Marquis.

01:26:32.525 --> 01:26:35.728
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:26:37.396 --> 01:26:39.498
Come on. Come on.

01:26:46.538 --> 01:26:48.041
Come on.

01:26:50.976 --> 01:26:52.776
Yeah.

01:27:00.152 --> 01:27:02.085
Come here. Come here.

01:27:02.087 --> 01:27:03.853
Hurry up.

01:27:15.166 --> 01:27:16.834
Fuck.

01:27:24.441 --> 01:27:26.507
Come here. Come here.

01:27:26.509 --> 01:27:28.642
Get in there.

01:27:28.644 --> 01:27:30.445
That's it.

01:27:30.447 --> 01:27:31.915
Wait a minute.

01:27:33.616 --> 01:27:36.683
No. Come on.

01:27:36.685 --> 01:27:39.453
No. Come on.

01:27:39.455 --> 01:27:41.488
Go there. Go there.

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:43.490
Marquis. Marquis.

01:27:43.492 --> 01:27:44.958
Marquis.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:47.461
You got to go.
When I say go, you go.

01:27:47.463 --> 01:27:49.630
Okay?

01:27:49.632 --> 01:27:51.931
Marquis, get out of here.

01:27:51.933 --> 01:27:53.068
Get out there!

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:06.581
Down now!

01:28:08.249 --> 01:28:09.781
Coleman, get on
the fucking ground!

01:28:09.783 --> 01:28:11.217
I'm not going anywhere!

01:28:11.219 --> 01:28:12.985
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Get on your knees!

01:28:12.987 --> 01:28:14.619
I promise,
I'm not going anywhere!

01:28:14.621 --> 01:28:17.756
Get on your knees!
Put your hands on your head!

01:28:17.758 --> 01:28:19.925
Onto the ground!

01:28:48.054 --> 01:28:52.587
<i>When I was six, I, uh,</i>

01:28:52.589 --> 01:28:56.628
<i>started to write letters of
support to your parole board.</i>

01:28:58.063 --> 01:29:01.066
<i>But your parole
was always denied, so...</i>

01:29:03.934 --> 01:29:07.536
<i>I thought it was my fault
that you were still in prison,</i>

01:29:07.538 --> 01:29:09.771
<i>because I...</i>

01:29:09.773 --> 01:29:12.177
<i>I wasn't a good enough writer.</i>

01:29:16.814 --> 01:29:21.615
<i>Then, when I got older,
I understood.</i>

01:29:21.617 --> 01:29:23.787
<i>You didn't want to get out.</i>

01:29:25.888 --> 01:29:28.257
<i>So I stopped writing.</i>

01:29:31.561 --> 01:29:33.929
<i>I kept one of those letters.</i>

01:29:36.566 --> 01:29:38.932
<i>"My dad is fun.</i>

01:29:38.934 --> 01:29:41.204
<i>Send him back home."</i>

01:29:56.584 --> 01:29:59.087
<i>Next time, I'll bring Martin.</i>

01:30:01.589 --> 01:30:03.657
<i>He's your grandson.</i>
