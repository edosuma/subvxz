04:40.080 --> 04:41.755
The New South Wales government

04:41.765 --> 04:44.515
has unveiled a radical solution
to the water crisis.

04:44.525 --> 04:48.715
It plans to tap into an abandoned
reservoir under the city.

04:48.725 --> 04:51.235
$95 million will be spent

04:51.245 --> 04:55.755
on a state-of-the-art water recycling
facility in the heart of Sydney.

04:55.765 --> 04:57.595
My name is Natasha Warner

04:57.605 --> 05:01.555
and I've worked in news and
current affairs for well over 10 years.

05:01.565 --> 05:03.875
I knew that I wanted to tell stories.

05:03.885 --> 05:06.435
I knew I wanted to communicate to the public

05:06.445 --> 05:10.155
and, um, that looked like
the perfect place for me.

05:10.165 --> 05:13.435
The NSW Minister for Water and the Environment

05:13.445 --> 05:17.035
has been under sustained fire for 12 months now.

05:17.045 --> 05:20.395
Sydney's water reserves are at an all-time low.

05:20.405 --> 05:23.595
We are a progressive government
and in the face of climate change

05:23.605 --> 05:26.995
we need to look at all possibilities,
and recycling water

05:27.005 --> 05:28.476
is definitely the way of the future.

05:28.486 --> 05:31.795
I first came across a story which was
focusing on the government

05:31.805 --> 05:34.156
that had just announced
some water recycling plans

05:34.166 --> 05:37.195
and they wanted to use
abandoned underground tunnels

05:37.205 --> 05:41.395
in one of our biggest rail systems.

05:41.405 --> 05:44.155
Thousands of people pass through here each day

05:44.165 --> 05:47.795
not realising the state government's
solution to the water crisis

05:47.805 --> 05:49.435
is beneath their feet.

05:49.445 --> 05:52.195
The plan is to build recycling infrastructure

05:52.205 --> 05:57.715
to make use of millions of litres of water
trapped in disused train tunnels.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.436
I didn't realise how vast they were.

05:59.446 --> 06:03.875
There's virtually a whole other city
underneath us.

06:03.885 --> 06:07.195
Welfare groups say the tunnels
are a refuge for Sydney's homeless.

06:07.205 --> 06:09.476
Building underground
water recycling infrastructure

06:09.486 --> 06:12.233
would leave them with nowhere to go.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.955
The new homeless concerns
are likely to cause another road block

06:16.965 --> 06:19.076
for the government's water crisis solution.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.995
In a similar scenario in the US,

06:22.005 --> 06:23.555
hundreds of homeless

06:23.565 --> 06:25.795
were recently evicted from underground tunnels.

06:25.805 --> 06:28.275
It caused a public relations nightmare.

06:28.285 --> 06:30.395
You can quickly see why the government's

06:30.405 --> 06:32.356
having so much trouble evicting the homeless.

06:32.366 --> 06:34.915
I mean, trying to navigate through

06:34.925 --> 06:37.915
this maze of dark tunnels is hard.

06:37.925 --> 06:39.995
Trying to find people hiding in here

06:40.005 --> 06:41.435
is virtually impossible.

06:41.445 --> 06:43.396
The Water and Environment minister says

06:43.406 --> 06:47.555
there is no evidence
of anyone living in Sydney's tunnels.

06:47.565 --> 06:51.678
He says if Labor wins the election,
the water solution will proceed.

06:52.720 --> 06:56.595
After the initial fanfare the story dried up

06:56.605 --> 06:59.435
It was like the whole thing never happened.

06:59.445 --> 07:03.955
That's when alarm bells went off in
my head. Things just don't disappear.

07:03.965 --> 07:07.475
Whenever something's not
spoken about, I've got to ask why.

07:07.485 --> 07:09.755
It's my job as a journalist.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.955
Cheers, John. Happy birthday.

07:20.965 --> 07:22.835
My birthday

07:22.845 --> 07:25.115
What's your birthday message?

07:25.125 --> 07:28.271
What do you have to say?
Uh, John

07:29.840 --> 07:32.595
Actually, I can tell you a story about John.

07:32.605 --> 07:35.555
You guys may not know this one,
it was way back in 1991.

07:35.565 --> 07:38.955
My name's Steve Miller,
I'm a TV cameraman.

07:38.965 --> 07:42.795
I've been working in news
and current affairs since the mid-'80s.

07:42.805 --> 07:45.995
Me and Pete had just started,
and they sent us to the first Gulf War.

07:46.005 --> 07:47.836
So we had to phone home to the office,

07:47.846 --> 07:49.836
to John, who was the news director at the time,

07:49.846 --> 07:51.395
and said, "Send us more cash.

07:51.405 --> 07:54.995
"We need to get some gas masks
and chemical suits and stuff."

07:55.005 --> 07:57.035
So they sent us, like, 10 grand.

07:57.045 --> 08:00.875
We've got this cash in our hand, we've
gone, "Fuck it, let's spend it on piss!"

08:00.885 --> 08:04.315
And the air raid sirens, everyone else
is fucking pulling on their masks,

08:04.325 --> 08:07.437
and we're just going, "Oh, fuck it."

08:08.800 --> 08:11.955
You kind of get married to the job,
so the people you work with,

08:11.965 --> 08:14.715
they end up becoming like family members.

08:14.725 --> 08:16.195
You've met our soundo.

08:16.205 --> 08:20.435
He's an incredibly handsome young
man, but he's not very good at his job.

08:20.445 --> 08:22.755
Come here, Tangles.
What're you talking about?

08:22.765 --> 08:25.475
I'm talking about the time in the States we went

08:25.485 --> 08:27.236
Two weeks you went without headphones.

08:27.246 --> 08:28.715
Remember that?

08:28.725 --> 08:30.995
And did anyone notice?
No-one noticed!

08:31.005 --> 08:33.155
He's a genius.
That's how good I am.

08:33.164 --> 08:36.240
I don't even need to hear it,
I feel it on the knobs.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.076
When you get that gang on the road,

08:40.086 --> 08:42.315
when you get Steve and Tangles out on a shoot,

08:42.325 --> 08:44.075
they're just

08:44.085 --> 08:46.595
They're professional,
but they're also kids.

08:46.605 --> 08:51.674
At the end of the day they like to
muck around and have a bit of a laugh.

08:52.880 --> 08:57.755
I remember Natasha,
she was at another network

08:57.765 --> 09:01.795
and then a couple of years later
they brought her across to us.

09:01.805 --> 09:04.355
First impression?

09:04.365 --> 09:07.475
Just another young person coming in

09:07.485 --> 09:10.555
getting paid too much money,
hadn't really proved herself.

09:10.565 --> 09:12.755
But, you know,
she was the next big thing.

09:12.765 --> 09:14.435
Hey, Pete! Pete!

09:14.445 --> 09:15.915
A business meeting?

09:15.925 --> 09:18.715
Production meeting.
Production meeting.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.476
Talking about producing some, uh

09:20.486 --> 09:23.560
.. sea-man.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.312
Well, yeah...produ

09:27.760 --> 09:30.558
How's that? You'd better turn that off soon.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.155
Pete!
Pete!

09:40.165 --> 09:42.035
Hey?
The one that got away!

09:42.045 --> 09:44.276
I'm not away, I'm here.
Haven't we done that story before?

09:44.286 --> 09:46.435
Come in here, mate.

09:46.445 --> 09:50.155
Pete and I, we had
an interesting working relationship.

09:50.165 --> 09:54.675
He was very determined
in the way he would do his job

09:54.685 --> 09:57.195
and I was very determined in the way
I would do mine.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.355
Sometimes that would work well together,

09:59.365 --> 10:02.915
and sometimes it would
sort of cause a bit of friction.

10:02.925 --> 10:07.275
Whenever her name came up,
the subject was changed pretty quickly.

10:07.285 --> 10:09.515
When you think back on it now,
you sort of go,

10:09.525 --> 10:12.353
"Oh, yeah, there was something going on there."

10:24.120 --> 10:27.835
I came across a YouTube video
which showed some youths

10:27.845 --> 10:31.115
defacing and vandalising
areas around the tunnels.

10:31.125 --> 10:35.195
Sef? Did you do this?

10:35.205 --> 10:37.475
You are fucking kidding me!

10:37.485 --> 10:39.116
Fucking teach them a lesson, then, eh?

10:39.126 --> 10:40.595
I fucking will.

10:40.605 --> 10:43.195
This is what I think of your shit, MK.

10:43.205 --> 10:46.075
Within that clip itself

10:46.085 --> 10:48.235
there was something unknown.

10:48.245 --> 10:51.640
Quite clearly, though, there was
something there in the tunnel.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.595
Fuck was that?

10:54.605 --> 10:56.515
Shh... Shh

10:56.525 --> 10:58.112
What was that?
Shut up.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.113
Fuck, what the fuck was that?

11:03.320 --> 11:04.753
They're still here.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.075
Oi!

11:09.085 --> 11:11.476
Give me the torch...
Sef, come on, let's get out of here.

11:11.486 --> 11:13.076
Just fucking give me the torch, you bitch!

11:13.086 --> 11:16.235
No, don't! Come on!
It's cool, it's fucking cool. Oi!

11:16.245 --> 11:18.755
Think you can tag on my fuckin' work, do ya?

11:18.765 --> 11:20.236
Fuck, Sef, come on.
We've gotta fucking

11:20.246 --> 11:21.715
Fuck.

11:21.725 --> 11:24.920
Sef!
Sef?

11:28.560 --> 11:30.790
Sef? What the hell, Sef? Come on!

11:31.840 --> 11:34.395
Hold on. Sef, ANSWER ME!

11:34.405 --> 11:37.275
Sef!
Fuck this. I'm out of here.

11:37.285 --> 11:39.196
Dez, hold on. Don't go anywhere. Wait.

11:39.206 --> 11:41.635
J, come on!
Dez, stop!

11:41.645 --> 11:44.995
Dez, don't rack off!
What the fuck are you doing? Help!

11:45.005 --> 11:49.640
Sef? Sef, answer me, please!

11:54.320 --> 11:57.915
Once I saw that clip, I thought,
"This is a story I can go to John with."

11:59.320 --> 12:01.955
You know,
"Finally it's got some strength."

12:01.965 --> 12:06.635
Since when does a decent journalist
use YouTube as research?

12:06.645 --> 12:10.475
It was a good clip, but at the time
I thought, "She's crazy."

12:10.485 --> 12:14.715
When I pitched the story to John,
he put Pete on this.

12:14.725 --> 12:16.955
What that meant was

12:16.965 --> 12:19.435
Pete had an upcoming job and story in China

12:19.445 --> 12:22.435
which he was very,
very passionate about.

12:22.445 --> 12:25.989
And I had to give him the news
that he was taken off the story.

12:34.440 --> 12:38.355
I first heard about the tunnels
being a potential story for us

12:38.365 --> 12:42.155
just as we were prepping up
actually to go to China, with Pete.

12:42.165 --> 12:44.596
Hey, mate, there's a focus chart there somewhere.

12:44.606 --> 12:46.996
Can you just hold it up for us?
Yeah, yeah. No worries.

12:47.006 --> 12:48.475
Beauty.

12:48.485 --> 12:50.515
He'd been working on this thing for a long time

12:50.525 --> 12:54.155
and he was pretty pumped
to get over there and get stuck into it.

12:54.165 --> 12:56.235
I think he had some pretty good leads,

12:56.245 --> 13:00.155
which could have blown
his career wide open... it was great.

13:00.165 --> 13:02.355
How's it look, mate?
Mate, it looks pretty good.

13:02.365 --> 13:04.276
It ought to, the amount the repairs cost.

13:04.286 --> 13:06.715
Thanks, Tangles. Nice one.

13:06.725 --> 13:08.556
No more throwing cameras around stairwells.

13:08.566 --> 13:11.675
Yeah, I told you guys it's not my fault, alright?

13:11.685 --> 13:16.235
Hey, um, you happy to go handheld?
The lighter we go, the quicker we move.

13:16.245 --> 13:18.835
Absolutely, mate.
We 're going to China after all.

13:18.845 --> 13:21.640
More room for cheap DVDs,
pirated software

13:23.120 --> 13:24.595
You're all class, mate.

13:24.605 --> 13:27.875
It was purely John's decision
to put Pete on this story.

13:27.885 --> 13:31.875
Well, I was a little uncomfortable
with having Pete there to start with.

13:31.885 --> 13:35.475
Like I said before,
we weren't exactly always gelling.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.876
I was really nervous about talking to Pete.

13:42.886 --> 13:44.552
I didn't wanna tell him.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.275
It's not that exciting,

14:03.285 --> 14:06.835
when you're building your hopes up
for this great big story

14:06.845 --> 14:08.956
and then you sort of get given a shit sandwich.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.075
I thought at that point
I was doing the right thing.

14:15.085 --> 14:18.435
I thought that Pete having to postpone
what he had planned

14:18.445 --> 14:20.476
was worth it in the end for the story.

14:25.440 --> 14:28.555
He did say he went in to see John.

14:28.565 --> 14:31.035
I don't know what happened in that room,

14:31.045 --> 14:33.595
and the contents of that conversation

14:33.605 --> 14:36.555
but, yeah, he had spoken to John about it,

14:36.565 --> 14:39.555
and I think it was from that point on

14:39.565 --> 14:42.950
it was clear he wasn't going to China
and Nat had won the day.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.316
Why did John go the other way?

15:00.880 --> 15:04.075
C'mon. We all know why John was favouring Nat.

15:04.085 --> 15:05.513
Eh?

15:12.960 --> 15:16.275
Once Peter was on the story
we started attending the daily pressers

15:16.285 --> 15:20.195
to try and find out what happened
to the water recycling plans.

15:20.205 --> 15:22.676
Pete was pissed off,
but, you know, Pete's a pro.

15:22.686 --> 15:24.676
Took him a day or two,
then he came round

15:24.686 --> 15:27.035
just like the guy he is.

15:27.045 --> 15:30.835
He started to do his own searching around

15:30.845 --> 15:33.195
He had contacts in the council who he spoke to.

15:33.205 --> 15:35.156
And some rumours started to surface

15:35.166 --> 15:37.715
that not only were there
homeless living in the tunnels,

15:37.725 --> 15:39.915
but there were homeless that were going missing.

15:39.925 --> 15:42.675
You know, at that point
we slowly started to think

15:42.685 --> 15:44.355
there may be something in this.

15:44.365 --> 15:46.355
So we just started

15:46.365 --> 15:48.749
by chasing the then water minister.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.875
The main thing that was apparent

15:51.885 --> 15:54.474
That he was staying quiet on the topic.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.235
He wouldn't talk to us...
no-one would talk to us.

15:58.245 --> 16:00.475
At that point, we were just getting stonewalled.

16:00.485 --> 16:02.955
If it was true that homeless were going missing,

16:02.965 --> 16:05.115
this was a big story.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.997
And it was a really important one.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.515
Where is he?
Through here.

16:11.525 --> 16:12.995
Minister!

16:13.005 --> 16:16.075
Minister, have you seen the report about
the homeless people in the tunnels?

16:16.085 --> 16:17.875
Nothing to say at the moment.

16:17.885 --> 16:20.516
Have you scrapped your plans because
people are going missing in the tunnels?

16:20.526 --> 16:22.595
No comment. No comment.

16:22.605 --> 16:24.316
Minister, should people be worried?

16:24.326 --> 16:26.231
Is there a threat in the underground tunnels?

16:33.880 --> 16:35.435
Well?

16:35.445 --> 16:38.955
Alright... that was alright.
You reckon?

16:38.965 --> 16:40.755
I knew we wouldn't get anything.

16:40.765 --> 16:44.835
I think that definitely on quite a large scale

16:44.845 --> 16:46.676
there was a lot of people in the government

16:46.686 --> 16:48.156
that knew what was going on.

16:48.166 --> 16:50.116
They knew what was going on down there.

16:50.126 --> 16:53.035
You know, with everything
that's happened subsequently,

16:53.045 --> 16:54.712
they were hiding stuff.

17:04.480 --> 17:08.474
I started getting in contact with
a few of the shelters around the city,

17:08.484 --> 17:11.994
and eventually I came across
one particular homeless man

17:12.005 --> 17:15.994
who I had believed
had been living in the tunnels.

17:16.005 --> 17:18.675
So this was...
I mean, this was fantastic.

17:18.685 --> 17:21.752
We had, finally, someone to speak to.

17:24.560 --> 17:28.155
Right, Trevor, just one sec.
I've gotta fix your mike, if that's OK.

17:30.960 --> 17:36.475
I'm not sure how she found Trevor,
but Natasha found Trevor.

17:36.485 --> 17:41.000
We went down to this home,
and we sat him down for an interview.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.035
Yeah, sweet.

17:45.045 --> 17:47.600
Alright, mate. This will be fun.
You'll be on telly.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.915
Alright, guys, I'm sweet.

17:50.925 --> 17:53.076
Trevor, if you don't feel
comfortable with anything

17:53.086 --> 17:55.155
you let me know at any time.

17:55.165 --> 17:58.475
And, um, when I'm asking you the questions,

17:58.485 --> 18:02.195
if you're not quite sure of an answer, that's OK

18:02.205 --> 18:04.476
We can fix it up later,
so don't worry about that.

18:04.486 --> 18:06.715
Good.
Yeah? Thank you.

18:06.725 --> 18:10.875
Well, the interview with Trevor was a tricky one

18:10.885 --> 18:13.755
but something that I am, I guess,

18:13.765 --> 18:16.195
always quite accustomed to dealing with.

18:16.205 --> 18:19.035
Trevor, I understand you've been living it rough

18:19.045 --> 18:20.473
Call me Trev.

18:21.520 --> 18:23.351
Trev? OK.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.475
Trev, I understand you've been living it
rough for quite some time now.

18:27.485 --> 18:31.435
What circumstances took you
to living in the tunnels?

18:31.445 --> 18:37.075
Uh... Well, it kept me and my mates
warm in the winter. Yeah.

18:37.085 --> 18:40.195
It all started out great,
chatting away to him.

18:40.205 --> 18:44.435
He started to tell me a little bit about,
you know, his circumstances,

18:44.445 --> 18:46.595
what led him to live in the tunnels.

18:46.605 --> 18:50.435
He started to really paint a picture
of what it was like there.

18:50.445 --> 18:53.475
And amongst your friends,
Alfie and Johnny and Harry

18:53.485 --> 18:55.315
and some of the others,

18:55.325 --> 18:57.959
do they still live down there... now?

19:01.160 --> 19:02.275
No.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.315
Trev?

19:08.325 --> 19:11.275
Hmm.
Are you OK? You comfortable?

19:11.285 --> 19:14.397
Hmm. Yeah.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.595
At that point in the interview,
I asked Trevor

19:18.605 --> 19:21.475
what he perhaps had been through in the tunnels.

19:21.485 --> 19:24.355
I asked Trevor what he had seen.

19:24.365 --> 19:27.511
Clearly something had happened to him.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.915
Trevor, did you know someone who went missing?

19:38.160 --> 19:40.594
Trevor, did anything happen to you down there?

19:46.120 --> 19:47.599
Trevor

19:48.800 --> 19:50.233
.. are you alright?

19:52.560 --> 19:53.515
NO!

20:15.840 --> 20:17.273
Shit.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.875
Did you get that before?
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

20:21.885 --> 20:23.871
Oh, my God

20:24.920 --> 20:26.433
Crazy.
I know.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.755
After Trevor's interview, it was clear
we were onto something.

20:33.765 --> 20:36.795
All the pieces of the puzzle were
symptoms of something deeper,

20:36.805 --> 20:38.315
I just didn't know what.

20:38.325 --> 20:40.235
I needed more.

20:40.245 --> 20:42.435
We needed to get down there.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.595
Your call may be recorded for training purposes.

20:49.605 --> 20:53.798
Please advise your operator if you
do not wish your call to be recorded.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.235
Hello, this is Pam.

21:04.245 --> 21:06.436
Oh, hi, Pam, it's Natasha Warner here.
How are you?

21:06.446 --> 21:09.755
I'm well, Nat, and you?
Yeah, good, good, thanks.

21:09.765 --> 21:11.755
Look, I'm just wondering if you can help me out.

21:11.765 --> 21:15.195
I'm working on a story and I need
to get into the tunnels under the CBD.

21:15.205 --> 21:17.435
Who do I need to talk to to make that happen?

21:17.445 --> 21:19.875
Right. What's the story?

21:19.885 --> 21:22.235
Oh, look, I just need half an hour.

21:22.245 --> 21:24.470
Um...just hang on a sec

21:29.120 --> 21:31.715
Nat, sorry... I can't help you this time.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.195
What?

21:33.205 --> 21:34.836
Apparently no-one's getting in there,

21:34.846 --> 21:36.956
and I don't think you'll be getting
any special treatment.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.515
C'mon, Pam, it's me.

21:39.525 --> 21:42.910
Exactly. And people got burnt
last time. I can't do it.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.755
I really need this.
Look, Pam, can you help me out?

21:47.765 --> 21:49.880
I'm sorry, Nat.'Bye.
Look, I just need half

21:55.200 --> 21:57.515
I guess it's easier to look at it now

21:57.525 --> 22:02.675
and say that I was perhaps under
a lot of pressure to get this story.

22:02.685 --> 22:06.995
At the time I just...
I felt I was doing my job.

22:07.005 --> 22:09.195
I was so focused on just doing my job.

22:09.205 --> 22:11.195
There was a lot of rumours kicking around

22:11.205 --> 22:14.235
she was in big trouble, and she
kind of really needed to lift her game

22:14.245 --> 22:15.958
otherwise she was gone.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.995
Well, I think that I'd put
a lot of work into my career

22:20.005 --> 22:24.198
and I think it was all basically
hanging on this one...one story.

22:25.240 --> 22:27.715
You know, I didn't really have a choice.

22:27.725 --> 22:30.115
Hey, Tangles,
how's your head, mate?

22:30.125 --> 22:33.635
Pete, I'm like a fucking shark.
As long as I keep moving, I'll be OK.

22:33.645 --> 22:35.476
Here we go... this is what you looked like

22:35.486 --> 22:37.436
after Steve pulled you out of the loo last night.

22:38.760 --> 22:40.635
Oh, Steve, new toy.

22:40.645 --> 22:44.075
Mate, waterproof, baby! A TG!
All the gear, yeah.

22:44.085 --> 22:45.596
Good at spending the network's money.

22:45.606 --> 22:47.956
It's not just water-resistant,
it's fully waterproof?

22:47.966 --> 22:49.435
Yeah, waterproof, mate.

22:49.445 --> 22:53.515
Yeah, can you roll up for me?
I'll, uh, give it a bit of sound. There it is.

22:53.525 --> 22:55.635
Sure, mate.
Sweet.

22:55.645 --> 22:57.755
Rolling.
Uh, great.

22:57.765 --> 23:01.515
Pete, I'll just get you to say some shit.

23:01.525 --> 23:03.875
Hang on...
One, two.

23:03.885 --> 23:06.915
Here, mate, just say some shit to that.
"Some shit to that."

23:06.925 --> 23:10.435
Um, yes, very excited to be
going down the smelly sewers

23:10.445 --> 23:11.915
Hello. How'd you go?

23:11.925 --> 23:16.435
Haven't got all the permits sorted
but, um, John's got us covered, OK?

23:16.445 --> 23:19.755
When Natasha said that John was covering us

23:19.765 --> 23:21.995
and we didn't have permits

23:22.005 --> 23:24.155
That's kind of a pretty loose arrangement,

23:24.165 --> 23:27.635
you know, you just sort of sit there
and go, "Oh, well, we must be fine."

23:27.645 --> 23:29.073
You sure?
Yeah.

23:30.680 --> 23:32.835
When?
We're on for tonight.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.395
Tonight? OK. So we are up?
Yeah, mate.

23:35.405 --> 23:38.555
Yep, tonight. You good?
Yeah, sweet. Yeah, I'm good, man.

23:38.565 --> 23:41.715
Alright.
The sooner we go, the better, hey?

23:41.725 --> 23:43.199
Yep.

23:44.360 --> 23:48.435
As a crew, it's... it's our job
to film it and get coverage.

23:48.445 --> 23:51.273
It's really not our job to question it.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.835
Hey, Pete, just hang back. I'm just
gonna get a shot of Nat walking in.

24:08.845 --> 24:09.835
Yeah? OK.

24:09.845 --> 24:13.635
Excuse me, guys?
Guys... Hold up, restricted area.

24:13.645 --> 24:15.795
Oh, sorry, mate.
Maybe no-one told you.

24:15.805 --> 24:19.035
We're just gonna be filming for about
half an hour. We'll be out of your hair.

24:19.045 --> 24:21.235
Just grabbing a few shots...
I'll need to see a permit.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.077
Permit?
Yeah, uh

24:28.160 --> 24:30.760
You got a permit?
I've got a driver's license.

24:35.520 --> 24:40.955
Pete... how much have you got in your wallet?

24:40.965 --> 24:42.393
You're kidding me, aren't you?

25:06.480 --> 25:08.675
We're not third world here,
it's not gonna work.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.635
Guys? Everyone, time to leave, please.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.115
Told you.
Fucking hell.

25:14.125 --> 25:15.678
Let's go, come on.

25:21.040 --> 25:24.874
I was that far into it
I couldn't go back at that point.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.755
We decided to find another way in,

25:29.765 --> 25:34.231
with or without official...assistance.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.835
We found some access round the other side.

25:51.845 --> 25:55.594
Yeah, it looked like a maintenance access.

26:01.360 --> 26:06.309
You sure John's got this sorted?
Grow some balls, Pete.

26:08.480 --> 26:14.155
I, at that point,
was starting to feel as though

26:14.165 --> 26:15.916
there was something not quite right.

26:15.926 --> 26:20.755
Um, so I thought,
to cover myself and to cover Tangles,

26:20.765 --> 26:22.875
and really to cover all of us,

26:22.885 --> 26:25.356
I'd just film pretty much everything
that was happening there.

26:25.366 --> 26:27.355
You know, I thought we had to have

26:27.365 --> 26:29.156
some sort of way of protecting ourselves,

26:29.166 --> 26:31.075
should something go wrong.

26:31.085 --> 26:34.035
You know, if we got busted
and fined or whatever, arrested,

26:34.045 --> 26:37.515
um, you know, I had some evidence it wasn't me

26:37.525 --> 26:40.035
trying to push us down there,
and it wasn't Tangles,

26:40.045 --> 26:41.917
but it was Natasha.

26:44.040 --> 26:45.996
Here... take this.

26:53.080 --> 26:54.229
Here we go.

26:55.760 --> 26:57.193
OK, let's go.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.476
You right? You want me to...
Take this.

27:02.486 --> 27:03.515
Yep.

27:03.525 --> 27:04.953
OK, make it quick.

27:26.040 --> 27:29.155
We just were kind of covering
our tracks as we went down

27:29.165 --> 27:30.957
You know, we didn't want to get discovered.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.156
Looking back on that

27:35.480 --> 27:38.074
.. that was probably a mistake.

27:41.680 --> 27:43.155
We OK?
Hey?

27:43.165 --> 27:44.835
Are we OK to be down here?

27:44.845 --> 27:46.910
That's what she said.
She said John's got us covered.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.795
When we start filming a story

28:09.805 --> 28:12.875
When we actually start
"OK, let's get it, let's roll"

28:12.885 --> 28:15.675
Pete and Natasha,
they look after the editorial content,

28:15.685 --> 28:19.915
and, you know, it's kind of
my job to take over there

28:19.925 --> 28:21.555
and look after the pictures.

28:21.565 --> 28:24.795
OK, turn around and come back.
I'll just get you walking past this grill.

28:24.805 --> 28:26.597
You guys just hang back there for a second.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.875
Tangles and I would go off and we'd just start

28:34.885 --> 28:37.515
getting stuck into it,
filming like we always would.

28:37.525 --> 28:40.637
You know, don't really need direction,
we'd just get into it.

28:47.160 --> 28:50.875
Once we got in sort of a little bit further,
there were whole sections of tunnels

28:50.885 --> 28:54.315
that were absolutely,
absolutely pitch black.

28:54.325 --> 28:57.835
It is completely black down there.

28:57.845 --> 29:01.475
You know, you could go in there,
turn the light off, spin around

29:01.485 --> 29:03.276
and you wouldn't know where you were.

29:03.286 --> 29:06.115
'Cause there's junctions,
tunnels going off everywhere.

29:06.125 --> 29:07.595
So I kind of thought

29:07.605 --> 29:10.235
The first time I turned off the light
and stood there, I thought

29:10.245 --> 29:13.755
we're gonna have to keep the light on
and stay across where we are

29:13.765 --> 29:16.433
'cause otherwise it's going to be
pretty easy to get lost down there.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.790
Hey, Tangles?
Yeah?

29:18.800 --> 29:20.275
Just come here, mate.

29:20.285 --> 29:22.516
There's something wrong with
my light. Can you check it out?

29:22.526 --> 29:24.116
What do you mean?
Is it the connection?

29:24.126 --> 29:26.915
Yeah, can you look in real close?
Is there something stuck on it?

29:26.925 --> 29:28.395
Ah, shit!

29:28.405 --> 29:31.040
How did I not see that coming?

29:33.600 --> 29:35.511
Thanks for that, Steve.
My eyes are stuffed.

29:37.840 --> 29:39.315
Great.
Let's go.

29:39.325 --> 29:40.916
Pete had sourced a map of the tunnels,

29:40.926 --> 29:44.595
but the further we got in, the more
we realised it wasn't exactly accurate.

29:44.605 --> 29:47.910
There were whole sections of tunnels
that weren't even on the map.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.157
Just give us some light here, Steve.

29:54.840 --> 29:59.152
OK. So that's the entrance,
that's where we came down before

30:03.880 --> 30:06.835
That's that way. That's not here...
I don't know why that is.

30:06.845 --> 30:08.395
OK, through here.

30:08.405 --> 30:11.275
Yep. That must be the way.

30:11.285 --> 30:14.235
Once we got through
and past the maintenance areas

30:14.245 --> 30:17.755
and we got into a little bit more
of the guts of the tunnels,

30:17.765 --> 30:20.355
my impressions were that...that it was amazing.

30:20.365 --> 30:23.755
It was vast, this place was huge.

30:23.765 --> 30:25.675
That's awesome.

30:25.685 --> 30:28.274
Shit, the sound's great.

30:29.480 --> 30:33.155
Pete? Can I have 10 minutes
to grab some overlay here?

30:33.165 --> 30:34.635
I'll give you five.

30:34.645 --> 30:36.115
Five?
Yep.

30:36.125 --> 30:38.635
We were very close to the station there, so, um,

30:38.645 --> 30:42.838
you know, Pete was trying
to make us pretty low-key.

30:48.840 --> 30:53.231
I was blown away by the size of it...
it was massive, and just eerie.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.590
You know, I think we were all in awe of it.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.315
It wasn't really difficult to get
great-looking shots down there,

31:20.325 --> 31:22.915
you know, 'cause you're really just
painting stuff with your light

31:22.925 --> 31:25.559
and whatever you saw there just was...
it looked really cool.

31:46.880 --> 31:49.348
This is looking really good.
Hey, guys, just hush for a sec.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.470
Alright, looks good. Yeah, sweet.

32:06.520 --> 32:09.755
The history to these tunnels, the ones
in particular that we were looking at,

32:09.765 --> 32:11.515
was just incredible.

32:11.525 --> 32:14.355
I mean, it dates back pre-World War II.

32:14.365 --> 32:19.035
They were to be used as
an underground rail system.

32:19.045 --> 32:22.112
Then in World War II
they were used as air raid shelters.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.198
Come have a look at this.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.555
The current NSW government

32:35.565 --> 32:39.315
is not the first to use these
tunnels for another purpose.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.116
I'm standing in a section of tunnel

32:41.126 --> 32:45.075
that was converted into an
air raid shelter during World War ll.

32:45.085 --> 32:47.275
It's complete with all the amenities

32:47.285 --> 32:50.158
that enabled soldiers to stay
for extended periods.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.715
Various rooms were then, um,

32:55.725 --> 33:00.435
reused and fashioned for training for the SAS.

33:00.445 --> 33:04.635
So time and time again they've,
I guess, been reinvented for their use,

33:04.645 --> 33:08.189
and even to this day with the water
recycling plans that were announced.

33:17.200 --> 33:19.316
I was fortunate enough to
come across an area where

33:19.326 --> 33:22.555
it was evident that there was definitely,
you know, homeless

33:22.565 --> 33:24.675
or, you know, people living down there.

33:24.685 --> 33:27.069
That's good...good just here.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.874
I'm right to go?
Hang on a sec.

33:32.320 --> 33:33.753
Go when you're ready.

33:34.840 --> 33:37.435
We've been walking in
the tunnel for less than an hour,

33:37.445 --> 33:40.155
and already we've come across somebody's home.

33:40.165 --> 33:44.355
Here you can see their makeshift bed, blanket

33:44.365 --> 33:46.075
and empty tins of food.

33:46.085 --> 33:49.595
Coming across the belongings was very important

33:49.605 --> 33:51.355
It was vital to the story.

33:51.365 --> 33:55.435
It was absolute proof
that there was life down here.

33:55.445 --> 33:57.876
While there is no sign of
an occupant at the moment,

33:57.886 --> 34:03.235
it is clear the minister's assertions
of abandoned tunnels are incorrect.

34:03.245 --> 34:05.436
This was something that
the government were denying.

34:05.446 --> 34:08.351
This is something that we could now prove.

34:10.679 --> 34:13.235
Hey, Nat, I'll get a shot of you
going down there, actually.

34:13.245 --> 34:14.715
Yeah, cool.

34:14.725 --> 34:17.594
Oh, hey. Light.

34:17.605 --> 34:19.192
Cheers.

34:29.880 --> 34:32.554
Mate, what's up?
What? Nothing.

34:32.565 --> 34:35.358
It's a bit tight down there, tubby.
You reckon you're gonna make it?

34:36.400 --> 34:38.239
He mustn't like working on the show.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.196
Nat! You alright?
Nat, you alright?

34:41.206 --> 34:42.315
Yeah, I'm right.

34:42.326 --> 34:44.197
Do you need a hand?
No, I'm fine.

34:46.120 --> 34:50.034
Nat? Look, we've already
got the sleeping bags and stuff,

34:50.045 --> 34:51.636
we don't really need to get the lake.

34:51.646 --> 34:53.876
We could probably do the rest up here.
Pete... Pete, I'm alright.

34:53.886 --> 34:55.716
I just think it's a little...
I'm fine!

34:55.726 --> 34:57.153
Just let's keep going.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.595
Alright, you take that.
Yeah.

35:00.605 --> 35:03.795
What's eating her?
Oh, she just really needs the story.

35:03.805 --> 35:06.355
After what happened last time,
she's treading on thin ice.

35:06.365 --> 35:07.875
Yeah, I reckon.

35:07.885 --> 35:10.675
That's why John put me onto this...
make sure she doesn't fuck up again.

35:10.685 --> 35:13.315
If she's not up to it,
why doesn't he give her the arse?

35:13.325 --> 35:15.995
Mate, I think John'd wanna
give her a little more than just that.

35:16.005 --> 35:18.236
Well, he'd have to get in line
behind you, wouldn't he?

35:18.246 --> 35:21.555
Hey, guys, you might
wanna know for future reference

35:21.565 --> 35:23.555
that these tunnels carry sound pretty well.

35:23.565 --> 35:26.680
And as far as I can hear,
you're all arseholes.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.955
Fuck off!

35:30.965 --> 35:33.474
Yeah, give me the torch.
Right, yeah, hang on.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.437
There you go, mate.

35:38.200 --> 35:42.235
Get down there, you arsehole.

35:42.245 --> 35:45.312
Pete, can you just lift that handle up
for me? Get a bit of sound.

35:46.840 --> 35:48.320
Where to? Just

35:52.960 --> 35:54.795
Yeah, nice.
Give it a kick.

35:54.805 --> 35:57.955
Yeah, give it a kick.
Send it on its way.

35:57.965 --> 36:00.275
What are we doing?
Just...just give it a kick.

36:00.285 --> 36:02.157
You call it.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.560
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.

36:13.480 --> 36:15.038
Thanks, guys.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.915
The lake was just...so...vast.

36:39.925 --> 36:43.275
I mean, this thing runs a kilometre long.

36:43.285 --> 36:44.998
It's bigger than I thought.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.560
Yeah, I get that a lot.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.636
Me and Tangles were mucking around a bit

36:50.646 --> 36:54.035
We like to play jokes on each other.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.195
You know, if I didn't do it,
he would've done it.

36:57.205 --> 36:59.036
So I just grabbed him and sort of went

36:59.046 --> 37:01.036
.. you know, at the edge of the lake,
went to push him in.

37:01.046 --> 37:03.036
You know how you go up,
hold onto their shoulders

37:03.046 --> 37:04.516
and pull them back again?

37:04.526 --> 37:08.115
Which I did, and then I let go of him,
and went to walk back to the camera

37:08.125 --> 37:09.600
In he went.

37:11.280 --> 37:13.915
Shit.
Tangles, are you right?

37:13.925 --> 37:16.835
Yeah, slipped.
There's your dip, mate.

37:16.845 --> 37:18.675
Steve, you...prick.

37:18.685 --> 37:21.195
Oi, this is not funny. It's fucking cold.

37:21.205 --> 37:23.440
Are you gonna give him a hand?
No, fuck him!

37:27.800 --> 37:30.195
This is not... Stop laughing, OK?

37:30.205 --> 37:32.235
How long are we gonna be down here, alright?

37:32.245 --> 37:35.955
Tangles, as much as we used to
joke around and muck around together,

37:35.965 --> 37:38.995
when it came time to work,
you know, he was very serious,

37:39.005 --> 37:41.435
and it wasn't time for joking.

37:41.445 --> 37:44.155
Creative department's ready.
Just letting you know.

37:44.165 --> 37:45.115
OK.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.955
Nat, just come forward a fraction.

37:48.965 --> 37:51.955
So, you know, when he's sort of
giving me the impression

37:51.965 --> 37:54.315
that there were problems,
I was believing him.

37:54.325 --> 37:58.315
I'm standing directly below
one of Sydney's busiest train stations.

37:58.325 --> 38:00.915
Behind me is the forgotten water resource

38:00.925 --> 38:03.195
that's causing all the controversy.

38:03.205 --> 38:04.796
Earlier this year the government

38:04.806 --> 38:07.555
Nat, sorry. Pete, are you making noise?
No.

38:07.565 --> 38:09.755
You weren't whispering?
No.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.636
Alright. Sorry, Nat.
Can we go from the top?

38:12.646 --> 38:14.631
Everyone, just keep it quiet. Thank you.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.755
OK, let's go from the top again.
Let's move.

38:19.765 --> 38:21.193
When you're ready, Nat.

38:23.840 --> 38:27.635
I'm standing directly below one of
Sydney's busiest train stations.

38:27.645 --> 38:29.955
Behind me is the forgotten water resource

38:29.965 --> 38:32.635
Nat, sorry. Are you guys
fucking with me? What's the noise?

38:32.645 --> 38:34.715
What are you hearing, mate?

38:34.725 --> 38:36.711
It's... Hang on, I'll just check the battery.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.315
Sweet, um, I don't know.

38:40.325 --> 38:42.915
Maybe it's your cables.
Yeah, cables don't fucking talk, Steve.

38:42.925 --> 38:45.795
Uh, alright. Sorry, Nat.
Go for it again, I'll see what I can do.

38:45.805 --> 38:47.233
Just go straight through.

38:48.800 --> 38:52.918
If Tangles says he heard something,
I do believe he felt he heard something.

38:54.320 --> 38:57.635
I can't describe how silent the place was,

38:57.645 --> 39:01.918
so at the time I didn't feel that...
he could have been hearing anything.

39:03.640 --> 39:06.115
It...it was strange.

39:06.125 --> 39:10.155
I was just thinking, you know,
it could have been a technical problem,

39:10.165 --> 39:14.675
could have been anything... some
RF interference, anything like that.

39:14.685 --> 39:18.835
But, you know, Tangles was adamant
there was something going on,

39:18.845 --> 39:23.709
and, uh, when he's serious about
something, you know, you believe him.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.235
Earlier this year,
the government announced,

39:27.245 --> 39:30.835
then quietly abandoned,
plans to recycle water from this lake.

39:30.845 --> 39:33.991
The Minister for Water
has yet to give a reason why.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.157
Beautiful. Pete, happy?
I'm happy. How are you, Tangles?

39:40.720 --> 39:43.835
Oh...yeah. Yeah, sweet, yeah.

39:43.845 --> 39:46.877
Alright, let's go.
Let's move, grab the sticks.

39:48.160 --> 39:49.593
Alright, let's go.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.799
After we'd finished our piece at the lake, um,

39:55.840 --> 39:58.673
we decided to head for the bell room.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.155
Righto, Nat.

40:03.165 --> 40:08.555
Basically the bell room was built as like
a air raid sort of alert back in the war.

40:08.565 --> 40:11.438
They would use it to warn people of danger.

40:13.280 --> 40:16.835
When we rang the bell,
it...it was deafening.

40:16.845 --> 40:18.995
It rattled your ribs.

40:19.005 --> 40:21.675
This bell is a relic of World War ll.

40:21.685 --> 40:24.715
It remains here in the confines
of an air raid shelter,

40:24.725 --> 40:27.632
as a reminder of what
imminent danger sounds like.

40:32.920 --> 40:36.515
Shit, that blew my levels
right off the meter, sorry. Um

40:36.525 --> 40:39.115
Hang on. Nat, can you just
hit the bell once more?

40:39.125 --> 40:40.872
Yep. Ready to go?
Yep.

40:45.480 --> 40:46.475
How's that?

40:46.485 --> 40:48.316
Nah, look, if you want me to get that,

40:48.326 --> 40:50.316
it's probably best I boom it from down the hall.

40:50.326 --> 40:53.392
Yeah, OK. Well, if we need it.
OK, cool, two seconds.

40:54.440 --> 40:59.675
Tangles decided to, um, go into
the adjoining room off the bell room

40:59.685 --> 41:01.875
and boom it from there

41:01.885 --> 41:06.075
just to basically kill the sound
of the level of the bell,

41:06.085 --> 41:09.795
which was just making his levels peak out.

41:09.805 --> 41:12.155
I don't really know much about recording sound,

41:12.165 --> 41:16.755
but I did at the time remember
thinking, "That's a bit weird."

41:16.765 --> 41:20.235
You know, why would you do that?
Just turn it down a little bit.

41:20.245 --> 41:22.435
Surely it's that simple?

41:22.445 --> 41:24.035
Uh, Steve, can you do me a favour?

41:24.045 --> 41:26.436
Can you just listen on the cans,
watch the levels for me?

41:26.446 --> 41:30.275
Why don't you get Pete to do it? He can
do camera, he must be able to do sound.

41:30.285 --> 41:31.838
Nah, mate, I've done enough hard work today.

41:32.880 --> 41:35.155
That's good, Nat, yeah.
I'll do it for ya, mate.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.955
Sorry, guys, it's just way too echoey in here.

41:40.965 --> 41:43.995
He asked me to listen to the audio for him,

41:44.005 --> 41:45.475
which was fine.

41:45.485 --> 41:49.155
It's just put on the headphones
and listen to it as it's being recorded.

41:49.165 --> 41:52.516
Here, Tangles. Take that.
Thanks very much.

41:56.760 --> 41:59.515
And then so Nat just went ahead and did it again,

41:59.525 --> 42:02.830
and, uh...that's

42:03.880 --> 42:05.313
That's when, uh

42:06.640 --> 42:08.471
.. that's when I heard it.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.715
Yeah, ready to go.

42:14.725 --> 42:16.355
Bell atmos.

42:16.365 --> 42:17.793
Whenever you're ready, Nat.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.113
What the fuck?

42:27.400 --> 42:28.992
Did you... did you hear that?
Yeah.

42:32.960 --> 42:34.475
Yo, Tangles!

42:34.485 --> 42:35.955
Tangles!

42:35.965 --> 42:38.475
Shit.
Tangles!

42:38.485 --> 42:41.517
Pete, we need some light
down here, mate. Tangles!

42:43.160 --> 42:46.315
Quick, light.
Shit. Steve, where are you?

42:46.325 --> 42:48.156
Down here. Straight, straight, straight.

42:48.166 --> 42:50.396
Just give us the camera, mate.
He's... he's gone.

42:50.406 --> 42:52.355
Where'd he go?
Tangles!

42:52.365 --> 42:54.156
What did you hear in the headphones?
Tangles!

42:54.166 --> 42:55.996
What did you hear in your headphones?

42:56.006 --> 42:57.475
Tangles!

42:57.485 --> 42:59.595
Would he be dickin' us round?

42:59.605 --> 43:01.875
Tangles!
Tangles, come on, mate!

43:01.885 --> 43:04.075
Steve, through here.

43:04.085 --> 43:06.833
Tangles!
Tangles!

43:07.880 --> 43:09.915
Yo, Tangles!
Here, I'll go down here.

43:09.925 --> 43:10.915
Yeah.

43:10.925 --> 43:12.756
You know, I knew there was something wrong.

43:12.766 --> 43:14.635
I knew he wasn't mucking around.

43:14.645 --> 43:16.517
My initial thought was just to get to him.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.435
It wasn't unlike them,

43:19.445 --> 43:23.274
so I guess my first instinct was
that they were having a joke.

43:25.600 --> 43:27.636
What, Nat thought we were
playing a prank, did she?

43:27.646 --> 43:29.073
You've spoken to her?

43:30.280 --> 43:31.759
She thought we were fucking around?

43:56.360 --> 43:57.998
Tangles, you good?

43:59.560 --> 44:01.152
Yep. Ready to go.

44:02.920 --> 44:04.433
Bell atmos.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.913
Tangles!

44:43.040 --> 44:44.916
Maybe through here...
No, that's a dead end.

44:44.926 --> 44:46.035
Tangles!

44:47.440 --> 44:49.590
Watch your step.
Tangles!

44:51.800 --> 44:53.355
Ah, great.
What's up?

44:53.365 --> 44:54.835
Battery.
You alright?

44:54.845 --> 44:56.316
Yeah, fuck. It's alright.

44:56.326 --> 44:58.555
Need the light? You got a spare?

44:58.565 --> 45:00.278
Yeah, it's in here, hang on.
OK.

45:01.840 --> 45:05.075
It became pretty evident, quite quickly,

45:05.085 --> 45:09.835
that we weren't gonna be able to
find anyone or anything without light.

45:09.845 --> 45:11.478
Got it.

45:13.280 --> 45:15.756
We'll get him, mate. We'll find him.
We'll find him, alright?

45:15.766 --> 45:17.235
Tangles!

45:17.245 --> 45:21.555
Now, I had my camera light and I knew I had about

45:21.565 --> 45:24.955
two, maybe three hours tops worth of light.

45:24.965 --> 45:26.436
Steve, where's your kit?
Tangles!

45:26.446 --> 45:27.916
Steve, where's your kit?
What?

45:27.926 --> 45:30.195
Where's your kit?
It's back in the bell room.

45:30.205 --> 45:33.635
OK. well... all the torches
are back there, aren't they?

45:33.645 --> 45:35.956
This is the only light you've got
and it's fucking around.

45:35.966 --> 45:38.595
We need the torches, mate.
We've gotta go back to the bell room.

45:38.605 --> 45:39.595
But Tangles

45:39.605 --> 45:41.436
It's alright. We'll get him.
We'll find him. C'mon.

45:41.446 --> 45:43.317
Fuck.
C'mon.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.356
Walked back into the bell room
and there was nothing.

45:47.366 --> 45:49.995
There was nothing there.
All the stuff had disappeared.

45:50.005 --> 45:51.796
Now, that was only in a matter of

45:51.806 --> 45:53.396
I don't know, couldn't have been too long.

45:53.406 --> 45:55.315
Shit, everything's gone.
What?

45:55.325 --> 45:56.796
What the hell's going on?

45:56.806 --> 45:58.996
It certainly raised some
concern because I didn't feel

45:59.006 --> 46:02.515
it was something that
Tangles could do by himself.

46:02.525 --> 46:03.515
Fuck!

46:03.525 --> 46:05.236
Hey, we're wasting time, guys. Let's go!

46:05.246 --> 46:06.673
Wait.
C'mon!

46:07.760 --> 46:10.035
Here, take this.
Pete!

46:10.045 --> 46:11.598
Just give me some light, Steve.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.315
OK.

46:16.325 --> 46:18.311
OK, Tangles went through here.

46:19.360 --> 46:21.276
If we follow that all the way round,

46:21.286 --> 46:23.915
it brings us back to this room,
we can scan the whole area.

46:23.925 --> 46:26.195
OK. So we split up and meet back here, yeah?

46:26.205 --> 46:28.196
No, we stick together.
That's the only light we've got.

46:28.206 --> 46:29.676
How many batteries have you got left?

46:29.686 --> 46:31.516
I've got two in my pouch, mate.
Let's go.

46:31.526 --> 46:35.355
Steve... STEVE!
Oh, fuck!

46:35.365 --> 46:38.395
It won't do Tangles any good
if we run round like headless cheeks.

46:38.405 --> 46:40.115
We stick together, alright?

46:40.125 --> 46:42.475
You'd better keep up, then.

46:42.485 --> 46:44.675
Tangles!
Steve, wait!

46:44.685 --> 46:46.432
C'mon, Nat.
Tangles!

46:47.480 --> 46:48.915
Yeah, I panicked.

46:48.925 --> 46:51.875
You know, it wasn't like
I'm trying to be a hero or anything.

46:51.885 --> 46:55.195
You know, the smarter thing might
have been to do something else

46:55.205 --> 46:58.155
but it was just instinct just kicking in.

46:58.165 --> 47:00.196
Tangles!

47:01.560 --> 47:05.115
So, what do you think?
Think of what?

47:05.125 --> 47:07.835
You know, Tangles,
is he dicking around?

47:07.845 --> 47:10.798
No, he wouldn't dick around for this long.

47:12.040 --> 47:14.075
Who took our stuff, then?

47:14.085 --> 47:16.315
Who took it? I don't know.

47:16.325 --> 47:18.715
Could have been the homeless, junkies

47:18.725 --> 47:21.553
I heard it, Pete.
You heard what?

47:23.120 --> 47:25.998
Whatever it was, mate.
Well, what was it, mate?

47:27.880 --> 47:32.035
Steve?
Look, let's just get going, OK?

47:32.045 --> 47:34.952
Steve? Steve? What was it?

47:38.800 --> 47:40.518
Shit.
Watch your step.

47:42.560 --> 47:44.040
What's in here?

47:48.760 --> 47:50.478
Oh, fuck.

47:58.720 --> 48:02.235
You right?
Yeah.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.715
Nope, nothing.

48:10.725 --> 48:13.275
Pete, we've been here twice before, mate.

48:13.285 --> 48:15.555
The only other place has got to be the lake.

48:17.960 --> 48:20.755
Maybe he went back from where we came.

48:20.765 --> 48:22.236
Maybe he's waiting for us.

48:22.246 --> 48:24.236
Oh, sure, mate. He's fucking
walked out in the pitch-black.

48:24.246 --> 48:26.516
He's at fucking Harry's, scoffing a pie.
I don't mean that.

48:26.526 --> 48:28.756
I mean he can't contact us.
Maybe he's waiting for us.

48:28.766 --> 48:30.716
No, Steve's right, OK?
Tangles is down here.

48:30.726 --> 48:33.075
He's got to be at the lake, mate.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.952
Well, how much light have you got?
I've got enough.

48:44.280 --> 48:46.715
Alright, then.

48:46.725 --> 48:49.518
Shh! Do you hear that?
Shh.

48:52.080 --> 48:53.560
Shh!

48:56.920 --> 48:58.435
Let's go!
Go.

48:58.445 --> 49:00.235
Tangles!

49:00.245 --> 49:02.275
Tangles!

49:02.285 --> 49:04.915
This way! Tangles!

49:04.925 --> 49:07.036
I heard him through here. Tangles!

49:08.440 --> 49:11.035
Tangles! I'm coming, mate!

49:11.045 --> 49:13.076
Oh, fuck it!
In here!

49:15.120 --> 49:16.595
Give us a hand. Quick.

49:16.605 --> 49:18.436
Get down and grab it at the bottom.

49:18.446 --> 49:21.000
Fuck it! Get it off! Get it open!

49:23.240 --> 49:25.635
Grab that back. Grab that.

49:25.645 --> 49:29.315
Oh, shit. Steve, help.

49:34.720 --> 49:35.675
Jesus.

49:36.720 --> 49:39.678
Steve, light. Light.

49:42.960 --> 49:44.518
Jesus Christ.

50:01.680 --> 50:03.755
Steve...
Yeah?

50:03.765 --> 50:05.352
His torch.

50:13.400 --> 50:17.632
It's his torch,
but it doesn't mean it's him, mate.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.555
I can't really describe it,
it was just

50:22.565 --> 50:25.472
There was blood and

50:27.440 --> 50:32.555
.. over in the corner was...Tangles's torch.

50:32.565 --> 50:36.555
I... I sort of thought of myself
as his older brother.

50:36.565 --> 50:39.595
You know, that was
the kind of relationship we had.

50:39.605 --> 50:43.875
And, uh, he was sort of entrusted to me.

50:43.885 --> 50:45.472
That's the way I felt about it.

50:52.080 --> 50:54.555
Let's go.
Could be anyone.

50:54.565 --> 50:56.275
C'mon. We've got to move.

50:56.285 --> 50:59.155
She's right. He could be close, mate.
What about Tangles?

50:59.165 --> 51:02.755
Whatever that fucking thing is,
it could be nearby.

51:02.765 --> 51:04.239
Come on.

51:05.320 --> 51:08.039
It's Tangles.
Come on.

51:09.120 --> 51:10.553
Let's go.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.635
Wait.
What?

51:17.645 --> 51:20.438
Wait, where's my camera?

51:21.640 --> 51:23.312
Just over there.

51:24.760 --> 51:27.715
It's not where I left it.
What?

51:27.725 --> 51:29.153
It's not where I left it.

51:31.040 --> 51:33.875
Before we entered the room Nat put the camera,

51:33.885 --> 51:36.155
the night vision camera, on the ground

51:36.165 --> 51:37.995
just outside the door.

51:38.005 --> 51:40.675
Um...and then we went in the room.

51:40.685 --> 51:43.435
We wouldn't have been in there
for more than two or three minutes,

51:43.445 --> 51:46.275
and then she came out,
we all came out together,

51:46.285 --> 51:48.076
and she noticed the camera had been moved.

51:48.086 --> 51:53.473
My instinct was to check it
and see if it had recorded something.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.315
Play it back.

51:58.325 --> 51:59.799
Tangles!

52:02.320 --> 52:03.799
Tangles!

52:07.840 --> 52:09.556
Get down and grab it at the bottom.

52:09.566 --> 52:11.240
Fuck it. Get it off! Get it open!

52:15.640 --> 52:17.073
Grab that back. Grab that.

52:38.600 --> 52:41.555
We played back the footage and, uh,

52:41.565 --> 52:43.555
someone had picked up the camera,

52:43.565 --> 52:45.835
it had come off the ground,

52:45.845 --> 52:48.559
and there were shots of us in the room.

52:53.040 --> 52:56.749
It's his torch,
but it doesn't mean it's him, mate.

53:02.520 --> 53:03.953
Let's go.

53:05.520 --> 53:09.399
C'mon. We've got to move.
She's right. He could be close, mate.

53:10.520 --> 53:13.512
Whatever that fucking this is,
it could be nearby.

53:15.520 --> 53:17.995
It's Tangles.
Come on.

53:18.005 --> 53:20.673
Let's go.

53:22.040 --> 53:23.755
And then we turn to come out

53:23.765 --> 53:27.915
and...the camera goes down

53:27.925 --> 53:30.912
and we just catch a glimpse...
it was just like one frame.

53:37.000 --> 53:39.155
It happened in a split second.

53:39.165 --> 53:40.636
I didn't know what it was, mate,

53:40.646 --> 53:43.871
but it was quick and it was fucking frightening.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.355
Fuck.

53:55.365 --> 53:56.793
Oi!

54:02.680 --> 54:04.113
This isn't good.

54:06.800 --> 54:10.875
We've got to get out of here.
We've got to get out of here.

54:10.885 --> 54:13.315
Mate, I am not fucking leaving him down here

54:13.325 --> 54:14.796
with whatever the fuck that was.

54:14.806 --> 54:16.796
Steve, listen, listen to me.
I'm not fucking leaving him.

54:16.806 --> 54:18.796
Look, right now my priority is with you and Nat.

54:18.806 --> 54:21.835
I'm not going to let what happened to
Tangles happen to both of you, alright?

54:21.845 --> 54:24.035
We have to get out to the top.

54:24.045 --> 54:25.635
You go on your own. Leave me here.

54:25.645 --> 54:28.275
Steve, we need your light. Come on.
You've got your own fucking light.

54:28.285 --> 54:30.236
Listen, Steve, listen to me.
Listen to me!

54:30.246 --> 54:31.555
Fuck off!
Listen to me!

54:31.565 --> 54:33.955
I'm not done!
Don't fucking touch me, man!

54:33.965 --> 54:36.715
Listen, listen!
Listen, listen, listen to me.

54:36.725 --> 54:38.395
Whatever that fucking thing is

54:38.405 --> 54:42.393
it's going to have a harder time
taking us out if we stick together.

54:43.640 --> 54:48.035
That's bullshit.
Listen. We need to get to the top.

54:48.045 --> 54:49.635
We need to get help.

54:49.645 --> 54:51.155
If we get more help down here,

54:51.165 --> 54:52.832
the better chance we 're going to find Tangles.

54:55.560 --> 54:59.475
Fucking Tangles, man.
I know, mate.

54:59.485 --> 55:04.675
Hey, mate, I'm with you.
I'm with you.

55:04.685 --> 55:06.193
Come on.

55:07.840 --> 55:10.235
Come on.

55:10.245 --> 55:11.795
Pete made sense,

55:11.805 --> 55:17.355
but I couldn't help but feel like
I was leaving Tangles behind.

55:17.365 --> 55:19.874
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

55:23.280 --> 55:26.397
Is he OK?
Just give him a few minutes.

55:27.840 --> 55:29.475
So, what's the plan?

55:29.485 --> 55:32.756
We get the fuck out of here
is the plan. Get back to the top.

55:35.640 --> 55:37.073
What?

55:39.080 --> 55:41.150
I think we should stay and look for Tangles.

55:49.760 --> 55:53.594
You're not here for Tangles.
You're not here for Tangles.

55:56.160 --> 55:58.390
Fuck!

56:01.560 --> 56:02.993
Just through here.

56:05.160 --> 56:07.037
Fuck!

56:08.120 --> 56:11.595
Back it up, back it up!
Hit the light. Kill the light.

56:11.605 --> 56:13.080
Fuck!
Shh!

56:15.000 --> 56:17.280
What is it, mate?
Shh, shh!

56:23.240 --> 56:24.755
Anyone down there?

56:24.765 --> 56:26.318
It's the guard.
Shit, it's the guard.

56:27.880 --> 56:32.195
Who's there?
Hey, mate, it's us. It's the film crew.

56:32.205 --> 56:34.036
I told you guys not to come down here.

56:34.046 --> 56:35.755
Yeah, look, I know, we're sorry.

56:35.765 --> 56:37.276
It's just our friend, he's gone missing.

56:37.286 --> 56:39.669
Someone... something's taken him.

56:41.760 --> 56:43.995
Right, I want all of you to come with me now.

56:44.005 --> 56:46.875
Hey, come on!
Mate, what's happening in here?

56:46.885 --> 56:49.715
Mate, tell us what's happening in here!
Nat, give it a break, Nat.

56:49.725 --> 56:51.720
We're leaving. LET'S GO!
Is he going to help us?

56:54.200 --> 56:56.430
Go! Go! Run!

56:59.520 --> 57:00.995
Keep moving!

57:01.005 --> 57:02.433
Keep going.

57:05.000 --> 57:06.752
Keep going, Nat.

57:07.840 --> 57:09.395
Fuck!
Not that way.

57:09.405 --> 57:11.277
Here. Through here.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.275
Kill the light.
Hey?

57:14.285 --> 57:15.793
Steve, kill the light!

57:21.480 --> 57:22.959
Shh!

57:46.280 --> 57:48.032
Where are we?
Shh!

57:54.800 --> 57:56.358
What was that?

57:57.640 --> 57:59.358
I don't know.

58:04.960 --> 58:07.394
Just keep it down,
it could be close.

58:11.840 --> 58:15.196
Did you see it?
No.

58:17.600 --> 58:19.955
But whatever it was,
it was fucking huge.

58:22.760 --> 58:25.832
Nat... turn it off.

58:32.080 --> 58:33.675
Everybody alright?

58:33.685 --> 58:35.155
Mate, mate, I'm alright.

58:35.165 --> 58:38.995
How about your arm?

58:39.005 --> 58:41.155
Give me the camera.
Let me see.

58:41.165 --> 58:43.155
I hit something when we were running. It's fine.

58:43.165 --> 58:45.675
Shit, Steve. It looks bad.
Nah.

58:45.685 --> 58:47.475
Here, Pete, I need to see.

58:47.485 --> 58:49.715
Here, show me.
Fuck. Doesn't look good, mate.

58:49.725 --> 58:52.553
I can't see.
There it is. You got it.

58:57.920 --> 58:59.353
Just there, yeah.

59:02.160 --> 59:03.832
Sorry, you right?

59:05.200 --> 59:07.835
I'll be fine, yeah.
Right, buddy?

59:07.845 --> 59:10.400
Thanks, though. Thanks.

59:17.080 --> 59:20.115
You guys ready to move soon?
We can't stay.

59:20.125 --> 59:21.875
I just need a minute. Hang on.

59:21.885 --> 59:23.711
What if that thing comes back?

59:25.920 --> 59:27.915
I don't know.

59:27.925 --> 59:34.155
Could we take it?
I doubt it.

59:34.165 --> 59:36.800
Only thing we've got to worry
about now is getting out of here.

59:51.520 --> 59:54.751
Hey, guys, I think it's gone.

59:56.120 --> 59:57.838
Right, let's get moving.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.275
Steve?
Yeah?

01:00:01.285 --> 01:00:03.635
You right, mate?
Yeah, mate. Yeah, I'm good.

01:00:03.645 --> 01:00:05.955
Let's go.
Just keep it quiet.

01:00:05.965 --> 01:00:07.393
Give me the camera.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.398
Just keep it quiet, OK?

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.993
OK, let's go.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:21.073
Stay close.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.113
Through here.

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.915
OK.

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:37.435
Just hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:00:37.445 --> 01:00:38.915
OK.

01:00:38.925 --> 01:00:40.592
Oh, fuck.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.475
Pete...
Shit!

01:00:44.485 --> 01:00:47.395
This wasn't here before.
Pete.

01:00:47.405 --> 01:00:50.035
What are you doing?
It's not on the map.

01:00:50.045 --> 01:00:51.956
What do you mean it's not on the map?

01:00:51.966 --> 01:00:53.871
It's only got one way.
This has got two.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.156
Pete, you've got to figure it out, OK?

01:00:57.166 --> 01:00:59.515
Just chill the fuck out.
It's not easy, alright?

01:00:59.525 --> 01:01:00.995
You've got to fix this.

01:01:01.005 --> 01:01:03.235
Just shut the fuck up and let me get through it.

01:01:03.245 --> 01:01:06.395
Nat, calm down, Nat.

01:01:06.405 --> 01:01:08.915
It's through here. We came back
through there. It's through here.

01:01:08.925 --> 01:01:11.070
OK, what if it's not the right way, mate?

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:18.555
Well, then... we find the safest room
and we wait it out.

01:01:18.565 --> 01:01:20.036
Oh, yeah, that's a good plan.

01:01:20.046 --> 01:01:21.836
John will figure out that we haven't called

01:01:21.846 --> 01:01:24.595
and he'll send someone down to find us.

01:01:24.605 --> 01:01:26.033
John knows we're here, right?

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.875
Nat

01:01:31.885 --> 01:01:33.996
Fucking tell me John knows we're here.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.319
Oh, you're fucking kidding me.

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:43.315
I can't...
Are you fucking serious?

01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:45.955
I... I needed you guys, OK?
I knew it!

01:01:45.965 --> 01:01:47.436
I needed you guys in this.

01:01:47.446 --> 01:01:48.915
You need us?
Yeah.

01:01:48.925 --> 01:01:51.115
We just lost a friend.

01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:53.475
You still need your fucking story?

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.915
No.
Huh?

01:01:55.925 --> 01:01:57.395
Fuck you.

01:01:57.405 --> 01:01:59.395
Fuck you.
Keep you voice down.

01:01:59.405 --> 01:02:00.916
You think you're a fucking journalist.
Shh!

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.916
We came down here to get a story, didn't we?

01:02:02.926 --> 01:02:04.916
And now we've got an important one,

01:02:04.926 --> 01:02:06.796
and you're fucking running scared!

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:08.233
Shhh!

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:11.833
Here's your fucking story.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.475
Here, you want your piece to camera?

01:02:17.485 --> 01:02:18.913
Come on. Let's go.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.155
What's your piece to camera for this one, huh?

01:02:22.165 --> 01:02:24.556
Do you want to tell us how...
how you lost your friend

01:02:24.566 --> 01:02:26.115
because of your fucking stupidity?

01:02:26.125 --> 01:02:27.995
Come on.
Waiting.

01:02:28.005 --> 01:02:30.315
Fuck you.
Come on, Nat.

01:02:30.325 --> 01:02:31.795
Come on.

01:02:31.805 --> 01:02:33.676
The best journalists can work under any pressure,

01:02:33.686 --> 01:02:35.352
any sort of circumstance, come on.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.555
See, you can't say shit, can you?

01:02:38.565 --> 01:02:40.035
You know why?

01:02:40.045 --> 01:02:43.271
Because you're not there, Nat.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.190
You're just not there.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.633
You're fucking pathetic.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.195
Here. Through here.
Yeah.

01:03:00.205 --> 01:03:01.435
Oh, shit.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:03.192
Listen.
Shh!

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.392
What the fuck...?

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.835
What?
Shh.

01:03:15.845 --> 01:03:17.795
What is it?

01:03:17.805 --> 01:03:19.275
Hear that?

01:03:19.285 --> 01:03:21.430
Through here.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:25.953
Kill the light.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.715
Shh!

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.151
Open the door, Nat.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.515
Open it up. Open it up.

01:03:41.525 --> 01:03:43.476
Guys, the lake's just here.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.593
Fuck!
Shh!

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.518
Let me see, let me see.

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:31.355
Is it Tangles, mate?
Shh, shh.

01:04:31.365 --> 01:04:32.875
What is it?
It's not Tangles.

01:04:32.885 --> 01:04:36.475
What's happened to his face?
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:36.485 --> 01:04:39.199
It's his eyes. Oh, Jesus.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.275
What's happening?

01:04:43.285 --> 01:04:44.755
We've got to help him.

01:04:44.765 --> 01:04:46.555
Let me see.

01:04:46.565 --> 01:04:49.313
Shh.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:41.798
Shh!

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:45.880
Oh, fuck. It's seen us.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.435
We got to go, come on, come on!
Come on, let's go!

01:05:57.445 --> 01:05:59.835
Steve!

01:05:59.845 --> 01:06:03.635
Fuck! Let's go. Ah!

01:06:03.645 --> 01:06:06.075
Go, go, GO!
Just move it!

01:06:06.085 --> 01:06:07.795
Jesus. Which way? Which way?

01:06:07.805 --> 01:06:09.475
This way?
Go! Go now!

01:06:09.485 --> 01:06:11.795
Where? Where?
Here, here, here. Through here!

01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:13.315
Steve!
Go!

01:06:13.325 --> 01:06:16.235
Come on! Keep moving!

01:06:16.245 --> 01:06:18.959
Steve! Is he still behind us?

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:21.715
I think we lost him!
You sure?

01:06:21.725 --> 01:06:24.115
I think so!
Shit.

01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:25.872
I think we lost it!

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.315
I don't... I don't think it followed us.

01:06:30.325 --> 01:06:33.075
In here. There's a light in here.
Here, here.

01:06:33.085 --> 01:06:34.875
There.

01:06:34.885 --> 01:06:37.553
What's that?
I think it's the Cross City Tunnel.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.475
Hello?
This is a bad place to stop.

01:06:42.485 --> 01:06:43.956
No, it's fucking pointless.

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:47.195
Hello?!
Shit, Pete.

01:06:47.205 --> 01:06:48.195
Shh!

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:51.988
Hello! Hello!
Shh! Shh!

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.195
You've got to keep it down.

01:06:56.205 --> 01:06:57.876
There's no-one there,
there's no-one there.

01:06:57.886 --> 01:07:02.155
Please, someone... help. Hello!
Shh, shh.

01:07:02.165 --> 01:07:05.355
Hello! Help!

01:07:05.365 --> 01:07:08.075
Help!
Shh! Nat, please. Let go. Please.

01:07:08.085 --> 01:07:09.556
You have to be quiet!
Help!

01:07:09.566 --> 01:07:12.275
Shh!

01:07:12.285 --> 01:07:14.515
Shh! Nat, Nat, Nat.

01:07:14.525 --> 01:07:17.395
Hey, you guys.
Help!

01:07:17.405 --> 01:07:18.636
You've gotta keep your voice down.

01:07:18.646 --> 01:07:21.715
Shhh!

01:07:21.725 --> 01:07:23.400
Shut her up.

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.837
Shh. Shh.

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:41.955
You get anything?
Can you see anything?

01:07:41.965 --> 01:07:43.791
Chuck the light.
Chuck the light over there.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.193
Nuh.

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:53.075
It's alright.
I'm sorry.

01:07:53.085 --> 01:07:55.235
Hey?
I'm sorry.

01:07:55.245 --> 01:07:56.912
It's alright, don't be sorry.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:06.195
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Shh.

01:08:06.205 --> 01:08:09.715
It's OK, shh. Shh.

01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.355
Everything was unravelling.

01:08:14.365 --> 01:08:16.112
It... it was because of me.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.314
I never meant for things to get so out of hand.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.478
Well, I didn't mean to let Pete down. I mean, I

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.354
I had thought I'd made
the right choice at the time

01:08:33.365 --> 01:08:34.917
and I didn't mean to let him down.

01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:59.115
Steve, through here.
Quick, quick. Come on, move it, mate.

01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:00.553
Up here.

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:08.470
Nat. Up.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.518
Come on. Shh!

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.312
Here, Nat, take this.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:23.160
Ohhh!

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:29.555
Mate, get up! Come on!
Ugh!

01:09:29.564 --> 01:09:32.194
You know, my natural instinct
was to turn around with the light,

01:09:32.205 --> 01:09:33.675
see what was going on.

01:09:33.685 --> 01:09:36.555
We'd just heard this sound,
Pete yelling out, and, uh,

01:09:36.564 --> 01:09:39.194
as soon as they sort of fell
into the pool of light

01:09:39.205 --> 01:09:42.715
the thing just...disappeared...
upped and left

01:09:42.725 --> 01:09:44.995
And that sort of dawned on me then

01:09:45.005 --> 01:09:50.915
that the light was our way
of keeping it away from us.

01:09:50.925 --> 01:09:53.435
Shit. Are you OK? You OK?
Come on!

01:09:53.444 --> 01:09:55.431
Fuck! Did you see that?

01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.755
It took off.
Let's get out of here. Let's go.

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:06.075
It didn't like the light.
Well, keep it on, then.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.991
Hold on. Nat.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.920
Nat!

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:15.835
Ah!
No!

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:16.956
Come on, come on!

01:10:16.966 --> 01:10:19.595
Come on, you fucker!
Pete! Pete, don't.

01:10:19.605 --> 01:10:21.715
Come on! Come on!
Go! Come on!

01:10:21.725 --> 01:10:23.795
It was almost like it was

01:10:23.805 --> 01:10:28.915
trying to get us in a position
where it could get to us as well.

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:32.754
It reminded me of a lion trying to
cut one animal out of a pack, a herd.

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:38.557
You know, get the weak one out,
easy to attack.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:45.475
Ah! Oh, fuck! Fuck.
We're losing the light!

01:10:45.485 --> 01:10:47.475
Oh, fuck!
- Steve!

01:10:47.485 --> 01:10:51.035
Oh, shit!
Back, back, back!

01:10:51.045 --> 01:10:52.871
BACK! Fuck!

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.280
Go through.

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.355
What's the matter?

01:11:09.365 --> 01:11:12.477
No, it's a dead end. It's a dead end.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.115
Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

01:11:16.125 --> 01:11:19.755
I thought that was it...
it was over.

01:11:19.765 --> 01:11:21.512
There was nowhere left to run.

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:27.672
Then I saw this tiny bit of wall
that looked like it had broken away.

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.795
Pete, take this, take this.

01:11:31.805 --> 01:11:34.395
Take it!

01:11:34.405 --> 01:11:36.075
Oh, shit!

01:11:36.085 --> 01:11:37.876
Give her a hand, Pete. Get in there.

01:11:37.886 --> 01:11:40.755
Hold the light still.

01:11:40.765 --> 01:11:43.911
Easy, Nat.
Shh, keep it down. Keep it down.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.875
Keep it down.

01:11:47.885 --> 01:11:50.635
Here, come through, Steve.

01:11:50.645 --> 01:11:52.115
Huh?
Come through.

01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:54.315
Go, go, go.
Go on, you go first.

01:11:54.325 --> 01:11:55.795
Come on, Nat.

01:11:55.805 --> 01:11:57.555
Good girl.

01:11:57.565 --> 01:11:59.676
Here, take this... quick.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.036
Here, Nat.
OK.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:06.877
Shh, shh, keep it down. Shh!

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.915
This isn't good.

01:12:52.925 --> 01:12:55.595
Steve.

01:12:55.605 --> 01:12:58.433
Steve, is that...? God.

01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.033
This isn't good.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.235
Steve.
Yeah?

01:13:05.245 --> 01:13:06.514
We've got to go.

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.915
Fuck!

01:13:09.925 --> 01:13:11.755
Light, mate, light.
Sorry.

01:13:11.765 --> 01:13:13.555
It's gone.
Batteries.

01:13:13.565 --> 01:13:14.555
Steve

01:13:14.565 --> 01:13:18.189
Fuck, I need some light over here.
Quick, Nat, light.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:24.436
Nat, the fucking light, Nat. Fuck!
Give me the torch.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.515
Oh, shit! That one's dead.

01:13:34.525 --> 01:13:36.835
Oh, Jesus.
There's only one left.

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:40.315
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

01:13:40.325 --> 01:13:41.753
Steve, we need that light.

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.435
We need the fucking light.
Steve, I need the fucking light!

01:13:46.445 --> 01:13:47.475
Come on!

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:51.435
OK.

01:13:51.445 --> 01:13:53.954
Oh, Jesus.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.072
OK, now

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.958
RUN!

01:18:20.520 --> 01:18:21.475
Steve.

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.595
Steve. OK, OK.

01:18:29.605 --> 01:18:31.555
Steve.

01:18:31.565 --> 01:18:35.155
Come on. It's going for her.
It's going for her.

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.155
We've got to go.

01:18:38.165 --> 01:18:39.957
Come on. Come on.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.349
Nat!
Nat!

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:45.275
Let her go!
Let her go, you fucker!

01:19:45.285 --> 01:19:47.840
Nat!

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.315
Take her. Take her!
OK.

01:19:51.325 --> 01:19:54.437
Go. Just go!
Come on, Nat. Alright, let's go.

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.275
Oh, shit. Come on.
- Come on!

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.440
Come on, you fucker!

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.795
Come on, Nat.

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:12.275
Come on, let's move!

01:20:12.285 --> 01:20:14.835
No...
Move!

01:20:14.845 --> 01:20:17.275
No.
Come on.

01:20:17.285 --> 01:20:19.795
Come on.

01:20:19.805 --> 01:20:22.075
Wait!
Come on.

01:20:22.085 --> 01:20:23.635
But Pete...
Come on!

01:20:23.645 --> 01:20:26.035
No. Steve, we can't leave.
Come on!

01:20:26.045 --> 01:20:27.675
We got

01:20:27.685 --> 01:20:30.353
Nat, keep moving.
Keep moving!

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:32.955
No.
We've got to keep moving!

01:20:32.965 --> 01:20:35.595
You can't leave Pete.
We can't! We've got to go!

01:20:35.605 --> 01:20:38.075
Come on, Nat.
We've got to keep moving.

01:20:38.085 --> 01:20:41.355
I think that Pete was looking out for us

01:20:41.365 --> 01:20:44.033
and I didn't want to leave him there.

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.873
Come on! Come on.

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:52.755
Pete wanted us to be safe...
I understand that.

01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:55.435
But I didn't...
I didn't want to leave Pete behind.

01:20:55.445 --> 01:20:57.315
Come on.

01:20:57.325 --> 01:20:59.795
Come on. Come on.
- Guys!

01:20:59.805 --> 01:21:02.195
Guys!

01:21:02.205 --> 01:21:05.715
Shit!
Guys!

01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:09.435
Oh, fuck. It's Pete. Fuck.

01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.395
Come on, man!

01:21:13.405 --> 01:21:15.595
When I heard Pete's voice

01:21:15.605 --> 01:21:20.235
coming down that tunnel,
out of the darkness, uh

01:21:20.245 --> 01:21:23.516
I mean, I wasn't expecting
to hear his voice again.

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.955
Pete, no...
I can't

01:21:27.965 --> 01:21:29.875
No

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:32.030
Let's go.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.000
Let's go!

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.470
No, Pete...
- Nat!

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:13.355
Pete, are you OK? Stay with me.
Help! Get some help! Someone!

01:22:13.365 --> 01:22:18.639
I need a phone! I need a phone!
Give me a phone! Give me a phone!

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.752
Hey.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.155
Hello. Police, fire or ambulance?

01:22:26.165 --> 01:22:27.835
Hello?
Yes. Hello?

01:22:27.845 --> 01:22:30.675
Do you need police, fire or ambulance?
Hello!

01:22:30.685 --> 01:22:32.156
Help! We need help, we need help!

01:22:32.166 --> 01:22:34.156
OK, miss, we'll get you some help.
What's happened?

01:22:34.166 --> 01:22:36.555
We're on platform one.
We're in the station.

01:22:36.565 --> 01:22:40.115
Please, you gotta get someone here now.

01:22:40.125 --> 01:22:45.555
My friend is dying. He's bleeding.
Please calm down, miss.

01:22:45.565 --> 01:22:48.995
I need you to tell me exactly
where you are and what's happening.

01:22:49.005 --> 01:22:51.155
I don't know... we're in the station

01:22:51.165 --> 01:22:54.435
and something...
something took our friend.

01:22:54.445 --> 01:22:57.755
OK, please stay calm.
You said you're at the station?

01:22:57.765 --> 01:23:01.515
Which station are you at?
Help me! Somebody HELP me!

01:23:01.525 --> 01:23:03.115
What are you doing?!

01:23:03.125 --> 01:23:05.680
Hello? Hello?

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.796
Hello? Are you there?

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.360
Hello?

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.920
Pete... Hey, Pete.

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:31.280
Pete

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.840
I'm sorry... Pete! PETE!

01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:54.035
Yeah, it's kind of hard to...
to talk about it now.

01:23:54.045 --> 01:23:56.035
But I didn't know he was dying at that point.

01:23:56.045 --> 01:23:59.155
You know, I thought we were all gonna be fine.

01:23:59.165 --> 01:24:00.835
I mean

01:24:00.845 --> 01:24:05.235
.. it had been so difficult to get
to that point where we got there,

01:24:05.245 --> 01:24:07.716
and then, you know, I thought
we were going to be OK.

01:24:07.726 --> 01:24:09.870
There was people around us,
there was light.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:14.475
I...you know... I would have been doing more

01:24:14.485 --> 01:24:16.710
if I thought he was lying there dying.

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:25.789
I...I feel that I could have
done more to help Pete.

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.675
You know, it's, um...it's easy to say

01:24:30.685 --> 01:24:34.275
that you would do things differently,
you know.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:40.077
It just didn't seem...very fair.

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.235
I got told by the first paramedics

01:24:45.245 --> 01:24:50.035
that, you know...
they'd sort of given up working on him,

01:24:50.045 --> 01:24:55.319
they sort of...you know...
took a while to get Nat away from him.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:24:59.915
And, uh,
it slowly, slowly dawned on me

01:24:59.925 --> 01:25:02.195
about that point, you know.

01:25:02.205 --> 01:25:03.755
They sort of walked away from him.

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.596
He was just lying there,
and he wasn't moving,

01:25:05.606 --> 01:25:07.670
and I was... I just thought, "Fuck."

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:13.672
I feel...I feel...I feel responsible.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:18.317
I don't want to say that
I felt like it was my fault.

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:49.795
I don't know exactly how
I've changed since that night.

01:25:49.805 --> 01:25:53.355
I can't help thinking we were so close.

01:25:53.365 --> 01:25:54.998
Help was right there.

01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:58.077
I go over it again and again.

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.957
Just constantly.

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.432
What would I do differently?

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.795
I was just pissed off with everyone, everything.

01:26:26.805 --> 01:26:28.233
The government

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:32.035
.. the police

01:26:32.045 --> 01:26:34.675
I mean, how much evidence do you want?

01:26:34.685 --> 01:26:38.434
It's just sad now, thinking about it.
It's pointless.

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:42.393
It's just fucking sad.
