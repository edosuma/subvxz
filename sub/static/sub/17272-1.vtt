SOME OTHER COMPANIES,

12:41.561 --> 12:42.662

AN ELECTRICAL,

12:44.331 --> 12:46.867
AND SOME KIND
OF ADHESIVE COMPANY.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.269
BORING, BUT ALL
MAKING A DECENT PROFIT.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.704

HERE COMES THE FUN PART.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.507
HOW MANY SHARES
OUTSTANDING YOU GOT?

14:00.507 --> 14:01.408
4 MILLION.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.043
DIVIDE 4 MILLION
INTO 100 MILLION,

14:03.043 --> 14:04.244
WHAT DO YOU GET?

14:04.244 --> 14:05.278
25.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.048
GOOD. THAT MEANS EACH
SHARE IS WORTH $25.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.050
BUT THAT
WAS ALL FOREPLAY.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.385
LET'S GO
FOR THE REAL THING.

14:13.820 --> 14:15.688

14:15.688 --> 14:18.691
WHEN I WOKE UP
3 WEEKS AGO.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.694
THAT'S A 10
FOR A $25-ITEM.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.096
WHAT A SALE.

14:23.096 --> 14:26.499
SOMETHING WORTH $25,
I CAN BUY IT FOR 10.

14:26.499 --> 14:29.069

FOR SALE, MR. GARFIELD.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.703
I DON'T WANT YOUR COMPANY,

14:30.703 --> 14:33.873
I JUST WANT WHAT EVERY
OTHER STOCKHOLDER WANTS--

14:33.873 --> 14:35.042
I WANT TO MAKE MONEY.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.944
YOU ARE
MAKING MONEY.

14:36.944 --> 14:39.346

AT 10. IT'S NOW 14.

14:39.346 --> 14:41.881

BECAUSE I'M BUYING IT.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.085

NOW YOU DO YOURS.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.054
GET RID OF THIS
WIRE AND CABLE DIVISION.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.222

14:49.222 --> 14:50.357
WOULD YOU EXCUSE US,
PLEASE?

14:50.357 --> 14:53.026
I WANT TO TALK
TO MR. GARFIELD ALONE.

THE FIRE DEPARTMENT,

21:45.838 --> 21:48.408
AND YOU KNOW
WHO I NEGOTIATE WITH?

21:48.408 --> 21:49.776
SKINNY LITTLE JOGGERS
WITH CONTACT LENSES

21:49.776 --> 21:51.944
ALL STINKING FROM
THE SAME AFTERSHAVE.

21:51.944 --> 21:52.879
I'M KATE SULLIVAN.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.481
I KNOW YOUR NAME.
WANT A CIGARETTE?

21:54.481 --> 21:55.482
NO, THANK YOU.

21:55.482 --> 21:58.351
DON'T LET ME STOP YOU.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.720
WHY WOULD YOU
STOP ME?

22:00.720 --> 22:03.456
WHAT ARE YOU,
A FUCKING LAWYER?

22:03.456 --> 22:05.892
DEPENDS ON WHO I'M WITH.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.327
WELCOME TO MY LIFE.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.329
SO, WHAT'S IT
GOING TO BE?

22:10.329 --> 22:13.433
SUE, SETTLE, DEFEND?

22:13.433 --> 22:15.167
I CAME TO TALK.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.736
BOOF!
OH, THAT'S TROUBLE.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.571
LAWYERS
WANT TO TALK--

22:18.571 --> 22:21.073
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.074
HOW ABOUT
A DOUGHNUT?

22:22.074 --> 22:23.075
NO, THANKS.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.345
WHY, ARE YOU
A HEALTH FOOD FREAK?

22:26.345 --> 22:27.880
NO. JUST NOT HUNGRY.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.049
YOU HAVE TO BE HUNGRY
TO EAT A DOUGHNUT?

22:30.049 --> 22:31.050
YOU DON'T?

22:31.050 --> 22:32.419
WHAT, ARE YOU
SHITTING ME?

22:32.419 --> 22:34.353
ALL MY LIFE I NEVER
HEARD SUCH A THING.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.688
HAVE TO BE HUNGRY.
WHY?

22:35.688 --> 22:36.956
IT DON'T TASTE
BETTER THAT WAY.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.491
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

22:38.491 --> 22:40.059
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

22:40.059 --> 22:41.394
I NEED A MONTH.

22:41.394 --> 22:42.462
GET LOST.

22:42.462 --> 22:44.397
I JUST GOT INVOLVED.
I NEED TIME

22:44.397 --> 22:45.732
TO GET EVERYBODY'S
ACT TOGETHER.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.300
MY ACT IS TOGETHER.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.703
IF YOU GIVE ME
SOME TIME,

22:50.703 --> 22:53.440
I THINK WE CAN WORK
SOMETHING OUT.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.374
SETTLE?

22:55.374 --> 22:57.376
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.446
I ONLY SETTLE
WHEN I'M IN TROUBLE.

22:59.446 --> 23:01.047
OR WHEN IT MAKES SENSE.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.783
IT ONLY MAKES SENSE
WHEN I'M IN TROUBLE.

23:03.783 --> 23:06.786
WELL, IF YOU PREFER,
WE'LL GO TO COURT.

23:06.786 --> 23:09.388
GET AN INJUNCTION,
HAVE A FIGHT.

23:09.388 --> 23:10.790
ALL KINDS
OF ALLEGATIONS.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.392
COSTS THEM, COSTS YOU,
AND FOR WHAT?

23:13.392 --> 23:14.727
I LIVE IN COURT.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.395
YOU GOT TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

23:21.133 --> 23:24.737
I WON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE.

23:26.873 --> 23:27.974
TWO WEEKS.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.375
STANDSTILL AGREEMENT.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.977
BOTH SIDES.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.044
NO MORE BUYING.

23:32.044 --> 23:33.580
TWO WEEKS.
THANK YOU.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.915
WHOA, WHOA!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

23:35.915 --> 23:37.316
WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT
WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

23:37.316 --> 23:39.519
WHAT'S THAT?

23:39.519 --> 23:42.922
YOU AND ME SWEATIN'
BETWEEN SATIN SHEETS.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.425
GARFIELD,

23:46.425 --> 23:49.428
PUT YOUR HAND
BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.731
DO IT!

23:52.765 --> 23:53.733
GOOD.

23:53.733 --> 23:56.368
LOOK DIRECTLY DOWN
AT THAT LITTLE GUY,

23:56.368 --> 23:58.605
AND YOU SAY, "YOU
MUST BEHAVE YOURSELF

23:58.605 --> 24:00.973
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE
PRESENCE OF A LADY."

24:00.973 --> 24:03.976
GARFIELD, YOU DON'T SAY
EXACTLY THAT RIGHT NOW

24:03.976 --> 24:05.812
I'M RESIGNING
FROM THIS CASE.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.283
YOU MUST BEHAVE
YOURSELF...

24:11.283 --> 24:12.685
YOU MUST
BEHAVE YOURSELF...

24:12.685 --> 24:14.253
WHEN YOU'RE
IN THE PRESENCE...

24:14.253 --> 24:16.255
WHEN YOU'RE
IN THE PRESENCE

24:16.255 --> 24:18.691
OF A LADY.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.531
SEE? NOT SO HARD.

24:32.805 --> 24:33.873
[BUZZ]

24:36.275 --> 24:38.477
SEE YOU
IN TWO WEEKS.

24:39.879 --> 24:41.948
WOW! DID YOU
SEE THAT, CARMEN?

24:41.948 --> 24:45.151
I LOVE IT, LOVE IT,
LOVE IT.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.152
GOODBYE,
MISS SULLIVAN.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.687
GOODBYE.

24:57.096 --> 24:58.497
[BUZZ]

25:03.202 --> 25:05.605
CALL ERICKSON, TELL HIM
TO ARRANGE SOME MONEY

25:05.605 --> 25:06.873
THROUGH THE ROYAL BANK.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.308
DON'T PAY HIM MORE THAN
WE DID ON FLEETWOOD.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.010
THEN CALL HATHAWAY,
TELL HIM

25:11.010 --> 25:12.378
I WANT
TO MAKE A TENDER OFFER

25:12.378 --> 25:13.913
FOR NEW ENGLAND
WIRE AND CABLE.

25:13.913 --> 25:17.884
DON'T PUT IT UNDER OUR NAME.
LABEL IT "OPM HOLDINGS."

25:17.884 --> 25:20.486
BUT WHAT IF SHE FINDS OUT
WE BROKE THE AGREEMENT?

25:20.486 --> 25:24.490
RICHARDSON, WERE
YOU BORN YESTERDAY?

25:24.490 --> 25:26.458
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SHE'S DOING AS WE SPEAK?

25:26.458 --> 25:29.528
THAT KEWPIE DOLL'S UP
TO NO GOOD. DO IT.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.931
I GOT US
AN EXTRA TWO WEEKS.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.332
NOW WE HAVE TO MOVE FAST.

25:33.332 --> 25:36.368
GET THE BOARD TO BUY UP
AS MANY SHARES AS THEY CAN.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.970
USE YOUR OWN
WORKING CAPITAL.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.506
Andrew: NO, NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE FOR.

25:40.506 --> 25:41.540
THAT'S OUR SAFETY NET.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.242
THEN BORROW THE MONEY.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.276
NO BORROWING.

25:44.276 --> 25:47.279
ANDREW, LISTEN TO HER.
SHE'S MAKING SENSE.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.281
FOR EVERY SHARE
YOU ACQUIRE,

25:49.281 --> 25:51.083
IT'S ONE LESS
FOR GARFIELD.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.552
THE MORE WE BUY,
THE LESS FOR HIM.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.555
THE MORE IT COSTS,
THE LESS PROFIT HE MAKES.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.957
SO GET THE STOCK UP.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.326
OH, AND MOM,
MAKE SURE TO BUY IT THROUGH

26:00.326 --> 26:01.327
AN OUT-OF-STATE BROKER.

26:01.327 --> 26:03.262
I DON'T WANT
TO BORROW MONEY.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.832
WE'VE BEEN DEBT-FREE
SINCE THE DEPRESSION.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.700
BUT SEE,
THAT'S THE TROUBLE.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.435
IT'S YOUR GORGEOUS
BALANCE SHEET

26:09.435 --> 26:11.237
THAT MAKES
YOU SO ATTRACTIVE.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.840
OH, AND MOM, GET LETTERS
OUT TO THE SHAREHOLDERS.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.442
TELL THEM
HOW GREAT BUSINESS IS,

26:16.442 --> 26:18.344
AND HOW WONDERFUL
THE FUTURE LOOKS.

26:18.344 --> 26:19.746
I'LL DO IT.

26:19.746 --> 26:22.348
GREAT. I'LL CALL YOU
TOMORROW. GOOD NIGHT.

26:42.568 --> 26:44.336
MMM.

26:45.738 --> 26:49.208
MMM...
GOOD MORNING, HONEY.

26:56.983 --> 26:59.652
HOW YOU DOING
THIS MORNING, HUH?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.356
OH...

27:05.624 --> 27:07.894
OOH...

27:07.894 --> 27:09.996
YOU GOT IT UP AGAIN.

27:09.996 --> 27:13.099
ANOTHER POINT
AND A HALF.

27:13.099 --> 27:13.900
PFEIFFER.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.501
GOOD MORNING,
MR. GARFIELD.

27:15.501 --> 27:16.502
WOODY.

27:16.502 --> 27:17.503
GOOD MORNING.

27:17.503 --> 27:18.771
HARRIET.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.506
MISS SULLIVAN IS GONNA
CALL TOMORROW MORNING.

27:20.506 --> 27:22.909
YOU TELL HER
I'M NOT TAKING CALLS.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.944
THEN WHEN SHE COMES
OVER HERE

27:24.944 --> 27:26.679
AND TRIES TO STORM
INTO THE OFFICE,

27:26.679 --> 27:27.914
YOU TRY TO KEEP HER OUT.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.281
BUT THEN YOU CAN
LET HER PUSH PAST.

27:29.281 --> 27:30.917
DON'T WORRY, SHE'S
DESPERATE BUT HARMLESS.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.185
FIND OUT WHERE SHE LIVES
AND CALL THE FLORIST.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.422
FLORIST?
FLORIST.

27:40.292 --> 27:43.696
YOU HAVE A GOOD EVENING,
MISS SULLIVAN.

27:45.397 --> 27:46.398
HELLO, MICHAEL.

27:46.398 --> 27:47.867
OH, MISS SULLIVAN. UH...

27:47.867 --> 27:50.770
HERE. SOMEBODY
BROUGHT THESE BY FOR YOU.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.404
OH, THANK YOU.

27:52.404 --> 27:53.405
GOOD NIGHT.

27:53.405 --> 27:54.406
GOOD NIGHT.

28:45.457 --> 28:46.458
GOOD MORNING.

28:46.458 --> 28:47.860
GOOD MORNING.

28:50.229 --> 28:54.700
OH! YOU RUTHLESS
SON OF A BITCH!

28:54.700 --> 28:55.835
EXCUSE ME?

28:55.835 --> 28:58.437
JEEZ, WHAT'S
HER PROBLEM?

29:16.288 --> 29:17.456
UHH!

29:17.456 --> 29:19.091
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

29:25.865 --> 29:28.467
SORRY TO GET
IN YOUR WAY.

29:28.467 --> 29:29.836
MAY I HELP YOU?

29:29.836 --> 29:31.037
I'M AFRAID
MR. GARFIELD ISN'T IN.

29:32.371 --> 29:33.772
I DON'T CARE!

29:33.772 --> 29:35.241
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HARRIET.

29:35.241 --> 29:38.610
NO, IT'S NOT ALL RIGHT,
YOU HYPOCRITE! YOU LIED!

29:38.610 --> 29:40.046
OH. BUT BABYPOO--

29:40.046 --> 29:41.680
WE HAD AN AGREEMENT.

29:41.680 --> 29:44.683
WE HAD A STANDSTILL!
NO MORE BUYING!

29:44.683 --> 29:46.819
YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT OPM HOLDINGS?

29:46.819 --> 29:48.821
OPM?
NOT MUCH TO KNOW.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.122
YOU BROKE THE AGREEMENT!

29:50.122 --> 29:52.724
YOU EMBARRASSED ME
WITH MY FIRM

29:52.724 --> 29:54.193
AND WITH MY CLIENTS!

29:54.193 --> 29:56.528
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.530
DON'T COME ON
SO HOLIER-THAN-THOU WITH ME.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.799
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,
SIT HER AND TWIDDLE MY THUMBS

30:00.799 --> 30:02.334
WHILE YOU DRIVE UP
THE PRICE OF THE STOCK?

30:02.334 --> 30:04.103
I DID NO SUCH THING.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.537
YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT.

30:05.537 --> 30:08.274
ALL THAT BUYING COMING
FROM SOME LITTLE FIRM

30:08.274 --> 30:09.341
IN RHODE ISLAND?

30:09.341 --> 30:11.810
YOU'D THINK YOU'D USE
AN OUT-OF-STATE FIRM.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.412
I KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT THAT.

30:13.412 --> 30:14.513
GIVE ME A BREAK.

30:14.513 --> 30:17.083
WHO AM DEALING WITH
HERE, MOTHER TERESA?

30:17.083 --> 30:18.550
YOU WANT
TO PLAY THE GAME,

30:18.550 --> 30:19.818
LEARN TO PLAY IT RIGHT.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.421
OH, IS THAT WHAT YOU
CALL IT, A GAME?

30:22.421 --> 30:23.655
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.224
THE BEST GAME
IN THE WORLD.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.226
I'LL TEACH YOU.
IT'S EASY.

30:27.226 --> 30:28.861
YOU MAKE
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN

30:28.861 --> 30:30.562
FOR AS LONG
AS YOU CAN.

30:30.562 --> 30:31.797
AND THEN WHAT?

30:31.797 --> 30:33.332
"AND THEN WHAT?"

30:33.332 --> 30:35.834
WHOEVER HAS THE MOST
WHEN HE DIES, WINS.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.837
LOOK. IT'S
THE AMERICAN WAY.

30:38.837 --> 30:42.841
I'M DOING MY JOB.
I'M A CAPITALIST.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.843
I'M SIMPLY
FOLLOWING THE LAW

30:44.843 --> 30:46.345
OF FREE ENTERPRISE.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.880
WHAT LAW IS THAT?

30:47.880 --> 30:49.515
SURVIVAL
OF THE FITTEST.

30:49.515 --> 30:52.384
WELL, MAYBE SOME PEOPLE
DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.054
MAYBE THEY DON'T SEE IT
AS SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.

30:55.054 --> 30:57.056
MAYBE THEY SEE IT
AS SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST!

30:57.056 --> 30:59.658
OH, KATIE, WHY ARE
YOU SO HARD ON ME?

30:59.658 --> 31:00.960
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT NICE.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.595
SINCE WHEN DO YOU HAVE
TO BE NICE TO BE RIGHT?

31:03.595 --> 31:05.998
YOU'RE NOT RIGHT.
YOU'RE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

31:05.998 --> 31:08.300
ONE DAY WE'LL SMARTEN UP
AND PASS SOME LAWS

31:08.300 --> 31:09.868
AND PUT YOU
OUT OF BUSINESS.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.905
THEY CAN PASS
ALL THE LAWS THEY WANT.

31:12.905 --> 31:15.908
ALL THEY CAN DO
IS CHANGE THE RULES.

31:15.908 --> 31:18.310
THEY CAN NEVER
STOP THE GAME.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.879
I DON'T GO AWAY.
I ADAPT.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.515
10 YEARS FROM NOW,
THEY'LL BE STUDYING YOU

31:23.515 --> 31:24.816
AT THE WHARTON SCHOOL.

31:24.816 --> 31:26.418
THEY'LL CALL IT
"THE GARFIELD ERA"

31:26.418 --> 31:29.455
AND RINSE THEIR MOUTHS OUT
WHEN THEY LEAVE THE ROOM!

31:29.455 --> 31:30.589
I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT!

31:30.589 --> 31:32.024
OH, KATIE,
DON'T LEAVE.

31:32.024 --> 31:33.759
WE HAVEN'T TALKED
ABOUT SEX YET.

31:33.759 --> 31:35.627
AT LEAST HAVE
A DOUGHNUT.

31:35.627 --> 31:36.628
STUFF IT!

31:36.628 --> 31:38.297
DON'T BE A POOR LOSER!

31:38.297 --> 31:40.166
LYING TO PROTECT
YOUR CLIENT

31:40.166 --> 31:43.035
IS JUST DOING A GOOD JOB!
I UNDERSTAND THAT!

31:43.035 --> 31:45.837
YOU DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME
WHAT OPM STANDS FOR!

31:45.837 --> 31:48.074
OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY!

31:53.179 --> 31:54.913
ALL RIGHT,
COME ON, COME ON!

31:54.913 --> 31:56.648
GET--LET'S GO!
WORK, WORK, WORK!

31:56.648 --> 31:57.984
YES, SIR!

32:23.942 --> 32:26.312
GOTCHA!

32:26.312 --> 32:28.547
OH, YES!

32:29.781 --> 32:31.750
HOW DO YOU HAVE 'EM?

32:31.750 --> 32:33.185
TWO YEARS AGO,

32:33.185 --> 32:35.787
HE TRIED TO TAKE OVER
WESTRIDGE CORPORATION.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.589
HE WAS PUT
UNDER INDICTMENT

32:37.589 --> 32:40.492
FOR NOT DISCLOSING
HIS 13-D. WHAT'S THIS?

32:40.492 --> 32:41.293
YOUR CHRISTMAS LIST.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.561
WHAT'D THEY DO TO HIM?

32:42.561 --> 32:43.862
NOTHING. THE GOVERNMENT
DROPPED THE CHARGES.

32:43.862 --> 32:45.197
NOPE.
INVESTORS GET HURT?

32:45.197 --> 32:47.933

IT WON'T KEEP.

01:10:35.332 --> 01:10:37.934
I WANT YOU
TO MARRY ME.

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:40.337
LET ME PUT IT
ANOTHER WAY.

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:42.539
I WANT TO MARRY YOU.

01:10:43.373 --> 01:10:45.309
YOU THINKING IT
OVER?

01:10:45.309 --> 01:10:47.344
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

01:10:47.344 --> 01:10:48.612
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:10:48.612 --> 01:10:49.946
I WANT YOU TO BE
MY WIFE.

01:10:49.946 --> 01:10:51.214
WE BELONG TOGETHER.

Bart:
KATHERINE.

01:10:52.349 --> 01:10:54.250
I'M GOING TO THE OPERA.
I GOT TO GO.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.653
NO, NO, KATE...

01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:58.288
YOU'RE
THE LAST THOUGHT I HAVE

01:10:58.288 --> 01:11:00.690
WHEN I FALL ASLEEP
AT NIGHT

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:02.359
AND THE FIRST
WHEN I WAKE UP

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:04.361
IN THE MORNING.

01:11:04.361 --> 01:11:07.831
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU
FOREVER AND EVER.

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:11.034
I WANT TO HAVE BABIES
WITH YOU.

01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:12.836
BABIES?

01:11:12.836 --> 01:11:13.837
YEAH.

01:11:15.305 --> 01:11:17.707
YOU SEE,
I GOT TO DO THIS NOW

01:11:17.707 --> 01:11:20.243
BECAUSE AFTER I WIN,
I WONDER MAYBE

01:11:20.243 --> 01:11:21.545
YOU WON'T EVER WANT
TO SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

01:11:21.545 --> 01:11:23.313
YOU CAN'T WIN BECAUSE
I'M GONNA WIN.

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:24.648
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
IT IS TO YOU,

01:11:24.648 --> 01:11:25.982
BUT YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO WIN.

01:11:25.982 --> 01:11:28.385
THIS IS WHAT'S
KILLING ME.

01:11:28.385 --> 01:11:31.421
I WANT YOU.
I NEED YOU. I LOVE YOU.

01:11:31.421 --> 01:11:32.489

WANT TO LOSE YOU.

KEEP YOUR PANTS ON,
WILL YOU, BART?

01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:36.660
I'VE GOT TO GO.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:40.397
YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS
THE FIRST ACT.

01:11:40.397 --> 01:11:41.965
IT SETS UP
THE WHOLE THING.

01:11:56.513 --> 01:11:58.715
IT'S A WONDERFUL
PRODUCTION.

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:04.020

01:13:33.943 --> 01:13:35.745
YOU OK?

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.614
YEAH.

01:13:37.614 --> 01:13:39.282
JUST GOING OVER
IN MY MIND

01:13:39.282 --> 01:13:40.750
WHAT I WANT TO SAY.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.352
THEY'RE PUTTING
SPEAKERS OUTSIDE.

01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:44.788
I THINK
EVERY SHAREHOLDER

01:13:44.788 --> 01:13:47.657
WITHIN DRIVING DISTANCE
IS COMING.

01:13:47.657 --> 01:13:49.993
I FEEL AS IF
WE'RE HARRY AND BESS

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:51.394
ON ELECTION NIGHT.

01:13:51.394 --> 01:13:53.262
HARRY TRUMAN
WAS A BETTER MAN THAN ME.

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:55.131
HE SLEPT
ON ELECTION NIGHT.

01:13:55.131 --> 01:13:57.767
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN DAYS.

01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:01.905
TALK TO ME.
TELL ME.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.510
I'M SCARED.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.947
I'M SCARED THAT...

01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:15.051
TIME HAS PASSED US BY.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:20.957
I'M SCARED I DON'T KNOW
THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT.

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:23.793
I'M SCARED
THAT WHAT I DO KNOW

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.162
DOESN'T COUNT
FOR ANYTHING ANYMORE.

01:14:26.162 --> 01:14:28.197
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:30.567
WHATEVER HAPPENED

01:14:30.567 --> 01:14:33.236

EACH OTHER?

01:14:36.973 --> 01:14:40.176
I DON'T WANT
THIS MAN TO WIN.

01:14:42.712 --> 01:14:46.550
I'M NOT SCARED.
I'M JUST PROUD.

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:51.454
I'M PROUD OF THE
BUSINESS WE'VE BUILT.

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:55.124
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

01:14:55.124 --> 01:14:56.726
AND IF WHAT WE ARE

01:14:56.726 --> 01:14:58.394
COUNTS FOR NOTHING
ANYMORE,

01:14:58.394 --> 01:15:01.531
THEN THAT'S THEIR
FAILING, NOT OURS.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.035
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:10.139
JUST GO OUT
AND TELL THE TRUTH.

01:15:12.742 --> 01:15:15.945

HELL, HARRY.

I FEEL WE'RE GOING
TO BE JUST FINE.

01:15:34.764 --> 01:15:37.100

FROM EVERYWHERE--

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.534
NEW YORK, BOSTON.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:40.003
THERE'S OZZIE.

01:15:40.003 --> 01:15:42.171

ISN'T IT?

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:45.909
EVERYBODY LOOKING OUT
FOR THEMSELVES.

01:15:48.912 --> 01:15:51.915
SO, DID YOU GET YOUR
GOLDEN PARACHUTE, BILL?

01:15:51.915 --> 01:15:55.051
DID HE FINALLY PROMISE
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU?

TO TALK ABOUT A FUNERAL

WHILE THERE WAS
NO CORPSE.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:15.639
WELL, TIME TO GO.

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:18.574

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:23.112
HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO VOTE?

OH, BOY. THEY'RE OUT
IN DROVES, ARTHUR.

01:16:45.702 --> 01:16:47.103
THEY GOT THE KIDS HERE.

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:49.806
WHY DO THEY ALWAYS
BRING THE KIDS, ARTHUR?

01:16:52.642 --> 01:16:55.244
THAT'S RIGHT--
HOORAY, HOORAY.

MAKE THE STOCKHOLDERS

WHAT ABOUT THE WORKERS?

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:38.935

OF SELF-DESTRUCTING...

01:20:48.077 --> 01:20:52.415
ON THIS DAY,
IN THE TOWN OF ITS BIRTH.

01:20:56.552 --> 01:21:01.124
THERE IS THE INSTRUMENT
OF OUR DESTRUCTION.

01:21:01.124 --> 01:21:04.760
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT HIM
IN ALL OF HIS GLORY--

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.163
LARRY THE LIQUIDATOR.

01:21:07.163 --> 01:21:11.100
THE ENTREPRENEUR OF
POST-INDUSTRIAL AMERICA

WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY.

THE ROBBER BARONS OF OLD

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:24.047
AT LEAST LEFT SOMETHING
TANGIBLE IN THEIR WAKE--

01:21:24.047 --> 01:21:27.917
A COAL MINE,
A RAILROAD, BANKS.

01:21:27.917 --> 01:21:29.919
THIS MAN LEAVES NOTHING.

01:21:29.919 --> 01:21:32.488
HE CREATES NOTHING.

01:21:32.488 --> 01:21:34.057
HE BUILDS NOTHING.

01:21:34.057 --> 01:21:36.259
HE RUNS NOTHING.

01:21:37.693 --> 01:21:40.096
AND IN HIS WAKE
LIES NOTHING

01:21:40.096 --> 01:21:42.098
BUT A BLIZZARD
OF PAPER

01:21:42.098 --> 01:21:43.699
TO COVER THE PAIN.

01:21:43.699 --> 01:21:46.102
OH, IF HE SAID,

01:21:46.102 --> 01:21:49.105
"I KNOW HOW TO RUN YOUR
BUSINESS BETTER THAN YOU,"

01:21:49.105 --> 01:21:52.775
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING
WORTH TALKING ABOUT.

01:21:52.775 --> 01:21:54.944
BUT HE'S NOT SAYING THAT.

01:21:54.944 --> 01:21:57.113
HE'S SAYING,
"I'M GOING TO KILL YOU

01:21:57.113 --> 01:22:00.416
"BECAUSE AT THIS PARTICULAR
MOMENT IN TIME,

01:22:00.416 --> 01:22:03.552
YOU'RE WORTH MORE
DEAD THAN ALIVE."

01:22:03.552 --> 01:22:05.488
WELL...

01:22:05.488 --> 01:22:06.889
MAYBE THAT'S TRUE,

01:22:06.889 --> 01:22:09.092
BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE

01:22:09.092 --> 01:22:13.696
THAT ONE DAY
THIS INDUSTRY WILL TURN,

01:22:13.696 --> 01:22:16.665
ONE DAY WHEN
THE YEN IS WEAKER,

01:22:16.665 --> 01:22:18.634
THE DOLLAR IS STRONGER,

01:22:18.634 --> 01:22:23.106
OR WHEN WE FINALLY BEGIN
TO REBUILD OUR ROADS,

01:22:23.106 --> 01:22:24.373
OUR BRIDGES,

01:22:24.373 --> 01:22:27.076
THE INFRASTRUCTURE
OF OUR COUNTRY,

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:28.677
DEMAND WILL SKYROCKET.

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:30.679
AND WHEN
THOSE THINGS HAPPEN,

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:33.249
WE WILL STILL BE HERE,

01:22:33.249 --> 01:22:35.851
STRONGER BECAUSE OF
OUR ORDEAL,

01:22:35.851 --> 01:22:38.988
STRONGER BECAUSE
WE HAVE SURVIVED.

01:22:38.988 --> 01:22:41.390
AND THE PRICE
OF OUR STOCK

01:22:41.390 --> 01:22:45.594
WILL MAKE HIS OFFER
PALE BY COMPARISON.

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:46.795
GOD SAVE US

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:51.867
IF WE VOTE TO TAKE HIS
PALTRY FEW DOLLARS AND RUN.

01:22:51.867 --> 01:22:54.303
GOD SAVE THIS COUNTRY

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:57.940
IF THAT IS TRULY
THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE.

01:22:57.940 --> 01:22:59.875
WE WILL THEN
HAVE BECOME A NATION

01:22:59.875 --> 01:23:01.477
THAT MAKES NOTHING
BUT HAMBURGERS,

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:03.112
CREATES NOTHING
BUT LAWYERS,

01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:06.415
AND SELLS NOTHING
BUT TAX SHELTERS.

01:23:06.415 --> 01:23:08.884
AND IF WE ARE
AT THAT POINT

01:23:08.884 --> 01:23:10.753
IN THIS COUNTRY

01:23:10.753 --> 01:23:11.820
WHERE WE KILL SOMETHING

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:14.023
BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT

01:23:14.023 --> 01:23:16.625
IT'S WORTH MORE
DEAD THAN ALIVE,

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:18.527
WELL,

01:23:18.527 --> 01:23:20.163
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

01:23:20.163 --> 01:23:22.165
LOOK AT YOUR NEIGHBOR.
LOOK AT YOUR NEIGHBOR.

01:23:22.165 --> 01:23:24.433
YOU WON'T KILL HIM,
WILL YOU?

01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:25.634
NO.

01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:27.736
IT'S CALLED MURDER,

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:29.138
AND IT'S ILLEGAL.

01:23:29.138 --> 01:23:31.140
WELL, THIS, TOO,
IS MURDER,

01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.008
ON A MASS SCALE.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:35.444
ONLY ON WALL STREET,

01:23:35.444 --> 01:23:39.648
THEY CALL IT
MAXIMIZING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:41.450
AND THEY CALL IT LEGAL.

01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:43.452
AND THEY SUBSTITUTE
DOLLAR BILLS

01:23:43.452 --> 01:23:46.089
WHERE A CONSCIENCE
SHOULD BE.

01:23:46.922 --> 01:23:48.324
DAMN IT!

01:23:48.324 --> 01:23:51.127
A BUSINESS
IS WORTH MORE

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:53.262
THAN THE PRICE
OF ITS STOCK.

01:23:53.262 --> 01:23:56.265
IT'S THE PLACE
WHERE WE EARN OUR LIVING,

01:23:56.265 --> 01:23:58.267
WHERE WE MEET
OUR FRIENDS,

01:23:58.267 --> 01:23:59.868
DREAM OUR DREAMS.

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.670
IT IS, IN EVERY SENSE,

01:24:01.670 --> 01:24:06.242
THE VERY FABRIC THAT BINDS
OUR SOCIETY TOGETHER.

01:24:06.242 --> 01:24:09.245
SO LET US NOW,
AT THIS MEETING,

01:24:09.245 --> 01:24:13.216
SAY TO EVERY GARFIELD
IN THE LAND,

01:24:13.216 --> 01:24:16.852
HERE WE BUILD THINGS,

01:24:16.852 --> 01:24:18.421
WE DON'T DESTROY THEM.

01:24:18.421 --> 01:24:20.823
HERE WE CARE ABOUT MORE

01:24:20.823 --> 01:24:23.492
THAN THE PRICE
OF OUR STOCK.

01:24:23.492 --> 01:24:29.098
HERE...WE CARE
ABOUT PEOPLE.

01:24:29.098 --> 01:24:31.300
[CHEERING]

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:54.557
THANK YOU.

01:24:56.125 --> 01:24:58.727
AND NOW I'D LIKE
TO INTRODUCE

01:24:58.727 --> 01:25:00.129
MR. LAWRENCE GARFIELD.

01:25:00.129 --> 01:25:02.131
[BOOING AND HISSING]

01:25:02.131 --> 01:25:04.500
EXCUSE ME--PLEASE.

01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:07.503
LET'S SHOW A LITTLE COURTESY,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

01:25:07.503 --> 01:25:10.573
MR. GARFIELD
IS THE PRESIDENT

01:25:10.573 --> 01:25:12.441
AND THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE BOARD OF...

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.610
GARFIELD INVESTMENTS.

01:25:14.610 --> 01:25:16.545
MR. GARFIELD.

01:25:16.545 --> 01:25:19.448
[BOOING]

01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:30.893
NO!
NO!

01:25:30.893 --> 01:25:32.895
[BOOING]

01:25:35.198 --> 01:25:37.233
GET OUT OF HERE!

01:25:38.501 --> 01:25:39.868
AMEN.

01:25:41.637 --> 01:25:43.739
AND AMEN.

01:25:43.739 --> 01:25:45.441
AND AMEN.

01:25:45.441 --> 01:25:47.109
YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.

01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:50.078
I'M NOT FAMILIAR
WITH THE LOCAL CUSTOM.

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:51.814
WHERE I COME FROM,

01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:55.117
YOU ALWAYS SAY AMEN
AFTER YOU HEAR A PRAYER.

01:25:55.117 --> 01:25:58.621
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT YOU JUST HEARD.

01:25:58.621 --> 01:25:59.722
A PRAYER.

01:26:01.924 --> 01:26:03.592
WHERE I COME FROM...

01:26:04.727 --> 01:26:07.463
THAT PARTICULAR PRAYER
IS CALLED

01:26:07.463 --> 01:26:09.665
THE PRAYER FOR THE DEAD.

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.070
YOU JUST HEARD
THE PRAYER FOR THE DEAD,

01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:17.139
MY FELLOW STOCKHOLDERS,

01:26:17.139 --> 01:26:18.807
AND YOU DIDN'T SAY AMEN.

01:26:20.476 --> 01:26:23.178
THIS COMPANY IS DEAD.

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:24.813
I DIDN'T KILL IT.

01:26:24.813 --> 01:26:26.215
DON'T BLAME ME.

01:26:26.215 --> 01:26:28.851
IT WAS DEAD
WHEN I GOT HERE.

01:26:32.521 --> 01:26:34.957
IT'S TOO LATE
FOR PRAYERS.

01:26:37.293 --> 01:26:40.296
FOR EVEN IF
THE PRAYERS WERE ANSWERED

01:26:40.296 --> 01:26:42.197
AND A MIRACLE OCCURRED

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:43.799
AND THE YEN DID THIS

01:26:43.799 --> 01:26:45.234
AND THE DOLLAR DID THAT

01:26:45.234 --> 01:26:46.969
AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE
DID THE OTHER THING,

01:26:46.969 --> 01:26:49.104
WE'D STILL BE DEAD.

01:26:49.104 --> 01:26:51.374
YOU KNOW WHY?

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:54.410
FIBER OPTICS.

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:57.446
NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:01.317
OBSOLESCENCE.

01:27:02.851 --> 01:27:04.453
WE'RE DEAD, ALL RIGHT.

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:06.889
WE'RE JUST NOT BROKE.

01:27:06.889 --> 01:27:07.690
AND DO YOU KNOW

01:27:07.690 --> 01:27:10.058
THE SUREST WAY
TO GO BROKE?

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:12.861
KEEP GETTING
AN INCREASING SHARE

01:27:12.861 --> 01:27:14.463
OF A SHRINKING MARKET.

01:27:14.463 --> 01:27:16.432
DOWN THE TUBES.

01:27:16.432 --> 01:27:19.368
SLOW BUT SURE.

01:27:19.368 --> 01:27:20.803
YOU KNOW,

01:27:20.803 --> 01:27:22.305
AT ONE TIME,
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN

01:27:22.305 --> 01:27:25.808
DOZENS OF COMPANIES
MAKING BUGGY WHIPS.

01:27:25.808 --> 01:27:29.978
AND I'LL BET
THE LAST COMPANY AROUND

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:31.213
WAS THE ONE THAT MADE

01:27:31.213 --> 01:27:34.016
THE BEST GODDAMN BUGGY WHIP
YOU EVER SAW.

01:27:34.016 --> 01:27:35.484
NOW, HOW WOULD YOU
HAVE LIKED

01:27:35.484 --> 01:27:37.286
TO HAVE BEEN A STOCKHOLDER
IN THAT COMPANY?

01:27:37.286 --> 01:27:41.056
YOU INVESTED
IN A BUSINESS,

01:27:41.056 --> 01:27:43.125
AND THIS BUSINESS
IS DEAD.

01:27:43.125 --> 01:27:44.993
LET'S HAVE
THE INTELLIGENCE,

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:46.695
LET'S HAVE THE DECENCY

01:27:46.695 --> 01:27:48.897
TO SIGN
THE DEATH CERTIFICATE,

01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:50.299
COLLECT THE INSURANCE,

01:27:50.299 --> 01:27:53.902
AND INVEST IN SOMETHING
WITH A FUTURE.

01:27:53.902 --> 01:27:56.472
"AHH, BUT WE CAN'T,"

01:27:56.472 --> 01:27:58.273
GOES THE PRAYER.

01:27:59.675 --> 01:28:02.678
WE CAN'T BECAUSE
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY,

01:28:02.678 --> 01:28:06.281
A RESPONSIBILITY
TO OUR EMPLOYEES,

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.683
TO OUR COMMUNITY.

01:28:07.683 --> 01:28:09.952
WHAT WILL HAPPEN
TO THEM?

01:28:09.952 --> 01:28:12.888
I GOT TWO WORDS FOR THAT.

01:28:12.888 --> 01:28:15.958
WHO CARES?

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:17.560
CARE ABOUT THEM?

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.361
WHY?

01:28:18.361 --> 01:28:21.129
THEY DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT YOU.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:22.565
THEY SUCKED YOU DRY.

01:28:22.565 --> 01:28:26.201
YOU HAVE NO
RESPONSIBILITY TO THEM.

01:28:26.201 --> 01:28:27.803
FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS,

01:28:27.803 --> 01:28:30.673
THIS COMPANY
BLED YOUR MONEY.

01:28:30.673 --> 01:28:32.708
DID THIS COMMUNITY
EVER SAY,

01:28:32.708 --> 01:28:35.478
"WE KNOW
TIMES ARE TOUGH--

01:28:35.478 --> 01:28:38.947
WE'LL LOWER TAXES,
REDUCE WATER AND SEWER"?

01:28:38.947 --> 01:28:40.349
CHECK IT OUT.

01:28:40.349 --> 01:28:43.352
YOU'RE PAYING TWICE
WHAT YOU DID 10 YEARS AGO.

01:28:43.352 --> 01:28:44.820
AND OUR DEVOTED EMPLOYEES

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:48.424
WHO'VE TAKEN NO INCREASES
FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS

01:28:48.424 --> 01:28:51.860
ARE STILL MAKING TWICE
WHAT THEY MADE 10 YEARS AGO.

01:28:51.860 --> 01:28:53.195
AND OUR STOCK--

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:56.832
1/6 WHAT IT WAS
10 YEARS AGO.

01:28:59.368 --> 01:29:00.969
WHO CARES?

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.872
I'LL TELL YOU.

01:29:03.872 --> 01:29:05.474
ME.

01:29:06.475 --> 01:29:09.478
I'M NOT YOUR BEST FRIEND.

01:29:09.478 --> 01:29:12.548
I'M YOUR ONLY FRIEND.

01:29:14.216 --> 01:29:16.985
I DON'T MAKE ANYTHING?

01:29:16.985 --> 01:29:18.421
I'M MAKING YOU MONEY.

01:29:18.421 --> 01:29:19.822
AND LEST WE FORGET,

01:29:19.822 --> 01:29:22.491
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
ANY OF YOU

01:29:22.491 --> 01:29:25.093
BECAME STOCKHOLDERS
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:26.495
YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY.

01:29:26.495 --> 01:29:28.897
YOU DON'T CARE
IF THEY MANUFACTURE

01:29:28.897 --> 01:29:31.099
WIRE AND CABLE,
FRIED CHICKEN,

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:32.501
OR GROW TANGERINES!

01:29:32.501 --> 01:29:36.171
YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY!

01:29:36.171 --> 01:29:39.241
I'M THE ONLY FRIEND
YOU'VE GOT.

01:29:39.241 --> 01:29:41.577
I'M MAKING YOU MONEY.

01:29:41.577 --> 01:29:44.179
TAKE THE MONEY.

01:29:44.179 --> 01:29:46.081
INVEST IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:48.283
MAYBE...

01:29:48.283 --> 01:29:49.685
MAYBE YOU'LL GET LUCKY,

01:29:49.685 --> 01:29:51.887
AND IT'LL BE USED
PRODUCTIVELY.

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:54.122
AND IF IT IS,

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:55.524
YOU'LL CREATE NEW JOBS

01:29:55.524 --> 01:29:57.526
AND PROVIDE A SERVICE
FOR THE ECONOMY

01:29:57.526 --> 01:29:59.027
AND, GOD FORBID,

01:29:59.027 --> 01:30:01.864
EVEN MAKE A FEW BUCKS
FOR YOURSELVES.

01:30:01.864 --> 01:30:04.266
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:04.266 --> 01:30:06.535
AND IF ANYBODY ASKS,

01:30:06.535 --> 01:30:09.505
TELL 'EM YOU GAVE
AT THE PLANT.

01:30:09.505 --> 01:30:11.039
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:11.039 --> 01:30:12.407
AND BY THE WAY,

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:16.144
IT PLEASES ME
THAT I AM CALLED

01:30:16.144 --> 01:30:19.381
LARRY THE LIQUIDATOR.

01:30:19.381 --> 01:30:21.283
YOU KNOW WHY,
FELLOW STOCKHOLDERS?

01:30:21.283 --> 01:30:23.418
BECAUSE AT MY FUNERAL,

01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.688
YOU'LL LEAVE WITH
A SMILE ON YOUR FACE

01:30:25.688 --> 01:30:28.691
AND A FEW BUCKS
IN YOUR POCKET.

01:30:28.691 --> 01:30:31.426
NOW, THAT'S A FUNERAL
WORTH HAVING.

01:30:45.908 --> 01:30:47.910
THE BALLOTS
WILL BE MARKED

01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:50.278
AND DEPOSITED
IN THE BALLOT BOXES

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.580
AT THE REAR
OF THE HALL.

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:52.781
THANK YOU.

01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:18.941
YEAH.

PLEASE.

01:31:44.132 --> 01:31:46.635
MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

01:31:46.635 --> 01:31:48.604
I WILL NOW READ

01:31:48.604 --> 01:31:50.739

SOUP OR SOMETHING?

HOW ABOUT SOME
OF THAT CARROT CAKE

01:34:57.692 --> 01:34:59.127
YOU LIKE SO MUCH?

01:35:03.165 --> 01:35:04.432
NO.

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:56.018
WELL, CARMEN,
WE DID IT AGAIN.

01:35:56.018 --> 01:36:00.488
I CAN ALWAYS
COUNT ON YOU, CAN'T I?

01:36:00.488 --> 01:36:03.291
ANOTHER BARRELFUL OF MONEY.

01:36:03.291 --> 01:36:06.761
NOT BAD FOR A KID
FROM THE BRONX.

01:36:11.233 --> 01:36:12.835
I LOVE MONEY.

01:36:14.402 --> 01:36:15.804
I LOVE MONEY.

[INTERCOM BEEPS]

01:36:17.405 --> 01:36:18.240
MR. GARFIELD,

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:21.009
KATE SULLIVAN
IS ON THE LINE.

01:36:23.111 --> 01:36:26.314
ARE YOU IN OR OUT,
MR. GARFIELD?

01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:29.017
HELLO?

01:36:29.017 --> 01:36:30.986
YOU'RE A GREEDY,
