00:01.100 --> 00:03.227
NARRATOR: Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:03.270 --> 00:04.362
It belongs to Alison.

00:04.400 --> 00:05.264
There's contact
information there,

00:05.300 --> 00:07.063
maybe for other people
who are helping her,

00:07.100 --> 00:08.237
or places to stay.

00:08.270 --> 00:09.498
This is Dean Stavros.

00:09.540 --> 00:11.235
He's going to be staying
with us for a while.

00:11.270 --> 00:12.771
I'm a drug and alcohol
abuse counselor.

00:12.810 --> 00:14.778
When police were questioning you
about that night,

00:14.810 --> 00:16.107
why wouldn't you
just tell them?

00:16.150 --> 00:17.640
Last night my
sister was alive.

00:17.680 --> 00:18.749
And it would have
made me a suspect.

00:18.780 --> 00:19.769
What is this?

00:19.820 --> 00:20.775
I was hoping
you could tell me.

00:20.820 --> 00:21.809
I didn't write it.

00:21.850 --> 00:22.817
Somebody else
knows Alison's alive

00:22.850 --> 00:23.714
and they told the cops.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.116
Mrs. DiLaurentis?
I'm Detective Holbrook.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.115
We'd like to have
a couple of words.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.115
Something wrong?

00:28.160 --> 00:29.184
This is a copy of
my manuscript.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.186
I found some stuff out
that could really help you.

00:31.230 --> 00:32.652
Ezra thinks
that "A" is Ali's mom.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.724
SPENCER:
And Mrs. DiLaurentis saw me

00:33.760 --> 00:35.796
pick up the shovel
and go after Ali.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.388
She thinks
I tried to kill Ali.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.730
( metal cracking )

01:20.540 --> 01:21.575
ARIA;
So waIt.

01:21.610 --> 01:23.339
You think that Paige
gave that note to the police?

01:23.380 --> 01:24.745
We don't think, we know.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.873
I mean it was her handwriting
and her stationery.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.411
Em, have you spoken
to her yet?

01:29.450 --> 01:31.315
She's in Maine
visiting family.

01:31.350 --> 01:33.659
You guys, if the police know
that All is alive--

01:33.690 --> 01:35.715
Then we're all gonna get
dragged in that precinct.

01:35.760 --> 01:38.684
Honestly, I'm a lot more worried
about Alison than I'm about us.

01:38.730 --> 01:40.425
So what are we gonna say
when the cops ask

01:40.460 --> 01:42.325
whose bones
are In Ali's grave?

01:42.370 --> 01:43.723
That we don't know.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.897
You guys, if the cops
are gonna question anybody,

01:45.930 --> 01:47.693
it's gonna be me.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.605
I'm the one who Ali's mom saw
with that shovel.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.335
But Ali's alive, Spencer.

01:51.370 --> 01:52.632
Yeah,
and somebody else isn't.

01:52.680 --> 01:53.874
And I'm the one
who might have bashed

01:53.910 --> 01:54.774
in the skull of a stranger.

01:54.810 --> 01:57.347
Okay, you really
need to eat something.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.449
Hanna,
give her your cookie.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.845
You give her your cookie.
I'm hungry.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.472
Aria, face it.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.283
That's why Ali's mom
has been stalking us

02:03.320 --> 02:04.617
ever since Mona put
on a straitjacket.

02:04.650 --> 02:07.483
Okay, let's back up
for a second.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.454
I get that Mrs. DiLaurentis
is really scary,

02:09.490 --> 02:11.481
but I'm not buying
that she's the devil.

02:11.530 --> 02:12.497
I agree.

02:12.530 --> 02:13.758
"A" knows Ali's alive.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.519
If she knew that why would she
waste her energy torturing us

02:16.570 --> 02:18.265
instead of bringing
her daughter back home?

02:18.300 --> 02:19.767
Maybe because she thinks
Ali won't be safe

02:19.800 --> 02:21.233
until I'm behind bars.

02:21.270 --> 02:23.500
Okay, you do need
this more than I do.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.565
Look, I'm not saying
she hasn't had help, okay.

02:25.610 --> 02:27.373
I stayed at that house,
Spencen

02:27.410 --> 02:29.503
Yeah, and you were almost
kebob-ed with a knitting needle.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.903
Um, that was me.

02:30.950 --> 02:33.316
I was there when she got
the divorce papers, okay.

02:33.350 --> 02:34.772
She's been through hell.

02:34.820 --> 02:37.288
Yeah, and that may also be
the birthplace on her passport.

02:38.550 --> 02:40.415
I always knew
she was a witch.

02:40.460 --> 02:41.484
Fitz is just confirming it.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.159
Yeah, and we all know
how much we can trust him.

02:44.960 --> 02:45.949
Where are you going?

02:45.990 --> 02:47.389
Home.
And you're my ride.

02:47.430 --> 02:48.590
Can we please go?

02:59.980 --> 03:02.369
Is that Jason?

03:02.410 --> 03:04.799
Jason. Jason.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.380
What was that about?

03:11.420 --> 03:13.809
Who knows?
When did he get back?

03:13.860 --> 03:16.681
I don't know.
But he totally saw us.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.220
Come on, hurry.

03:22.730 --> 03:24.823
Hurry.
I don't want to lose him.

03:24.870 --> 03:26.599
Why would he just take off
like that?

03:31.870 --> 03:33.428
What's going on?
It's stuck.

03:35.310 --> 03:36.470
What's that?

03:36.510 --> 03:37.670
What?

04:03.970 --> 04:06.575
* Got a secret,
can you keep it *

04:06.610 --> 04:09.272
* Swear this one you'll save

04:09.310 --> 04:11.608
_ _* Better
lock It In your pocket *

04:11.650 --> 04:14.369
* Taking this one
to the grave *

04:14.420 --> 04:16.479
* If I show you,
then I know *

04:16.520 --> 04:19.045
* You won't tell
what I saId *

04:19.090 --> 04:21.752
* 'Cause
two can keep a secret *

04:21.790 --> 04:24.281
* If one of them is dead

04:25.560 --> 04:26.891
ELLA ( on phone ):
It's not about money.

04:26.930 --> 04:29.364
It's about getting wasted
in a motel room.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.719
I wasn't wasted, Mom.

04:30.770 --> 04:34.365
The friend I was with
was the one that was drinking.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.890
Which friend?
This was one friend?

04:35.940 --> 04:36.964
Because your father
made it sound like

04:37.010 --> 04:38.898
you were hosting
the "Rolling Stones."

04:38.940 --> 04:40.635
Yes, mom, it was one friend.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.675
Does this have
anything to do

04:42.710 --> 04:45.270
_ _with Mr. Fitz
resrgnlng from Rosewood?

04:46.980 --> 04:48.538
How did you know
about that?

04:48.580 --> 04:52.380
Aria, what's going on?

04:52.420 --> 04:53.853
Nothing.

04:53.890 --> 04:56.552
I'm fine, honestly.

04:56.590 --> 04:59.081
I just can't really talk about
this first thing in the morning.

04:59.130 --> 05:01.826
Well, would it be
any easier

05:01.860 --> 05:04.624
if I was at the foot
of your bed?

05:04.670 --> 05:06.558
( door opens )

05:17.580 --> 05:20.071
But Jason's not answering,
Emily.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.849
He's unloading boxes
from his car.

05:21.880 --> 05:23.939
I'm just gonna walk over there
and try to talk to him.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.348
Talk to you later.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.358
You're up early.

05:29.390 --> 05:31.858
Yeah, I have to go talk
to somebody before school.

05:31.890 --> 05:33.528
Okay, I'll grab my jacket.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.494
No, Dean,
you don't have to come.

05:35.530 --> 05:36.565
Yeah, I do.

05:36.600 --> 05:38.568
Your folks hired me
to be with you at all times.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.966
Okay, I get it, but this--

05:41.000 --> 05:43.639
my friend, you're gonna
make him very uncomfortable.

05:45.540 --> 05:46.768
Why the pause?

05:46.810 --> 05:48.539
What?

05:48.580 --> 05:50.844
You paused
before you said friend.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.778
How come?

05:51.810 --> 05:54.608
Because he's my next door
neighbor, okay,

05:54.650 --> 05:57.539
and he's also my--
it's complicated, okay.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.012
You're making it sound more
and more inviting.

05:59.050 --> 06:00.119
Dean, seriously, please.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.980
He just
got out of rehab himself.

06:02.020 --> 06:04.625
And if my sobriety-sitter tags
along as a chaperone--

06:04.660 --> 06:05.752
It's my job.

06:05.790 --> 06:07.519
It's annoying, okay.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.165
I'm not going to meet him
behind a dumpster to cook meth.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.497
I'm just walking next door.

06:11.530 --> 06:12.963
Can you just watch us
from the window?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.991
Okay, fine.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.001
Where's the cup?

06:18.210 --> 06:19.802
Spencer,
I need a urine sample.

06:19.840 --> 06:20.909
That's the deal.

06:22.210 --> 06:24.007
Well, I'm tapped out.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.074
Well...

06:27.780 --> 06:29.042
Replenish and we'll wait.

06:33.660 --> 06:34.888
Don't touch that.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.024
Don't touch that either.

06:37.060 --> 06:38.652
Where am I supposed to eat?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.024
Right there.

06:48.170 --> 06:50.638
Shouldn't Mrs. DiLaurentis
be doing all the work?

06:50.670 --> 06:53.901
I mean isn't she the one
hosting the stupid bridal show?

06:53.940 --> 06:55.805
It's not stupid,
it's for charity.

06:57.010 --> 06:59.103
And Jessica's just
a little distracted right now.

06:59.150 --> 07:00.572
Something's going on.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.787
Have you ever wondered
why she offered you a job?

07:04.820 --> 07:06.856
I mean you guys
weren't even friends.

07:06.890 --> 07:08.915
It's not like I had many

07:08.960 --> 07:10.848
after I checked out
of cell block H.

07:10.890 --> 07:14.724
I'm sorry, I just--
I don't trust her.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.194
And you shouldn't either.

07:17.230 --> 07:19.664
She helped this family
through a very difficult time.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.191
And the least we can do
is be there for her.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.128
EMILY: Was the door
slammed in your face?

07:24.170 --> 07:26.832
No. He was just inside
by the time that I got there.

07:26.880 --> 07:27.733
What happened?

07:27.780 --> 07:30.704
Dean and his obsession
with my bladder.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.775
Well, I thought you were
allowed more privileges.

07:32.820 --> 07:34.549
You can't escape the cup,
Emily.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.112
Oh, hey.

07:41.290 --> 07:42.621
When did you get back?

07:42.660 --> 07:44.218
Late last night.

07:44.260 --> 07:45.625
I was going to call you
this morning.

07:45.660 --> 07:46.991
But you didn't.

07:49.000 --> 07:49.989
I'll see you later.

07:53.670 --> 07:55.888
So does your phone stop working
when you leave the state?

07:55.940 --> 07:58.204
It was wall-to-wall
family stuff.

07:58.240 --> 08:01.676
My grandparents
are needy and old.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.177
All grandparents are old.

08:04.910 --> 08:06.104
Emily--

08:06.150 --> 08:07.947
You told the police.

08:07.980 --> 08:08.810
You promised me
you wouldn't

08:08.850 --> 08:10.249
and then you went ahead
and told them.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.712
I did it to protect you.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.149
And who's going
to protect Alison?

08:13.190 --> 08:14.748
I don't think she needs any.

08:14.790 --> 08:16.553
I see.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.886
So you totally played me

08:18.930 --> 08:20.898
and you got
exactly what you wanted.

08:20.930 --> 08:22.727
Revenge on Alison.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.260
This isn't about revenge.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.267
Really?

08:25.300 --> 08:26.631
She's been hiding
for 2 years

08:26.670 --> 08:28.035
from somebody who tried
to kill her.

08:28.070 --> 08:29.560
And by you ratting her
out to the cops,

08:29.610 --> 08:30.736
you just sent out
a search party.

08:30.770 --> 08:32.670
Then let the cops
protect her.

08:32.710 --> 08:34.075
And what if they don't
get there first?

08:39.180 --> 08:41.148
Well, she knows
something's up with Ezra.

08:41.180 --> 08:42.738
Wait, you're not gonna
tell your mom

08:42.790 --> 08:44.280
what really went down
with him, are you?

08:44.320 --> 08:46.754
Look, Hanna,
don't worry.

08:46.790 --> 08:48.109
I am not gonna overshare.

08:49.930 --> 08:50.988
Talk later, okay.

08:57.970 --> 09:00.598
Hey, how's it going?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.130
Uh, it's going.

09:02.170 --> 09:05.264
Wow, I thought
I had a lot of homework.

09:05.310 --> 09:06.402
It's a job.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.170
The library, they hire
a couple of students every year.

09:09.210 --> 09:10.677
I'm gonna be late.

09:10.710 --> 09:11.938
Excuse me.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.911
Hey, Travis, wait.

09:16.950 --> 09:19.009
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other night.

09:19.050 --> 09:20.654
It's not that I didn't have
a good tIme.

09:20.690 --> 09:23.284
I just--
I've had a lot going on.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.848
It kind of seems like you've
always got a lot going on.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.856
Well, can we have
a do-over?

09:28.900 --> 09:31.323
You, me,
tomorrow night?

09:31.370 --> 09:32.462
We don't even have
to call it a date.

09:32.500 --> 09:37.369
We can just eat at the same time
across from each other.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.605
I can't. I'm busy.

09:39.640 --> 09:41.608
Oh, okay.

09:43.380 --> 09:45.075
I guess I'll see you later.

09:52.660 --> 09:53.752
JESSICA:
What are you talking about?

09:53.790 --> 09:55.087
People have to eat.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.680
I thought we agreed
to do finger foods

09:57.730 --> 09:59.721
before the speeches,
Michael.

09:59.760 --> 10:01.159
Ashley, check in there.

10:02.300 --> 10:06.168
A seafood parfait
is not a finger food.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.394
No_ one wants
to rurn a manicure

10:07.440 --> 10:09.260
digging shrimp
out of a skinny cup.

10:12.240 --> 10:13.229
Figure it out, please.

10:15.180 --> 10:17.671
Ashley, would you mind going
upstairs to get the place cards?

10:17.710 --> 10:19.405
They're in a bag
in the guest room.

10:19.450 --> 10:20.872
Sure.
Thank you.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.024
Good morning.

10:39.270 --> 10:40.237
May I come in?

10:40.270 --> 10:42.192
Now is not a good time.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.838
I wanted to give you an update
on the investigation.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.338
Can we please just let my
daughter rest in peace?

10:50.380 --> 10:52.814
Mrs. DiLaurentis,
we're not certain

10:52.850 --> 10:55.148
that your daughter
is in that grave.

10:55.180 --> 10:57.148
Well, I am.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.886
When you reported
Alison missing,

10:59.920 --> 11:04.186
you gave the Rosewood P.D.
a file of family photos.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.152
One of them shows
Alison as a young girl

11:06.190 --> 11:09.091
with a break in her right arm.

11:09.130 --> 11:12.293
But the coroner didn't report
any fracture in that bone.

11:12.330 --> 11:14.969
Then the coroner
made a mistake.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.969
Well, the only way
to know for certain

11:18.010 --> 11:19.978
is if we exhume the body.

11:22.380 --> 11:24.200
That's not going to happen.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.139
I already have
a judge's order.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.944
I'm not here_ _
to ask your permrssron.

11:32.090 --> 11:33.910
Just to keep you informed.

12:29.910 --> 12:31.309
She bought these yesterday.

12:36.150 --> 12:38.380
Does this look like
a guest room to you?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.149
I...

13:01.380 --> 13:02.972
VOICEMAIL: Bon giorno.

13:03.010 --> 13:04.045
You've reached
Mamma Gabusi's.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.048
We are currently closed
for renovations.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.509
Jason.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.478
What's going on?

13:17.530 --> 13:18.588
I just needed to get
a paycheck reissued.

13:18.630 --> 13:20.393
No, I'm talking
about last night

13:20.430 --> 13:21.419
when you saw me
and Spencer.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.223
I had to get home.
Get home?

13:23.270 --> 13:24.362
Jason, I haven't
heard from you

13:24.400 --> 13:28.131
since I left almost half my
body in an elevator shaft.

13:28.170 --> 13:29.159
Yeah, I know.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.906
I felt pretty bad about that.

13:30.940 --> 13:32.601
You were just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

13:32.640 --> 13:33.902
Wilden was after me.

13:33.940 --> 13:36.408
Wait. You think Wilden
was behind that?

13:36.440 --> 13:37.998
Who else?

13:38.050 --> 13:40.075
Look, I know it hasn't
been easy for you.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.041
And so does Spencer.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.538
I mean we heard you
kind of had a relapse.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.239
But last night
when we tried--

13:46.290 --> 13:47.382
Emily, my mom's got
a lot of stuff

13:47.420 --> 13:49.149
going on right now, all right.

13:49.190 --> 13:50.452
I kind of need
to keep a little space

13:50.490 --> 13:51.855
between me and Spencer.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.050
Why?

13:53.100 --> 13:54.055
Because I need
to keep a little space

13:54.100 --> 13:55.897
between her and my mom.

13:55.930 --> 13:57.488
Our family's already being
harassed by the police,

13:57.530 --> 13:58.929
we don't need it
from the girl next door, too.

13:58.970 --> 14:00.232
I'm not excusing Spencer,

14:00.270 --> 14:02.329
but we both know
your mom can be--

14:02.370 --> 14:03.337
If you're expecting me
to dump on her,

14:03.370 --> 14:04.405
it's not gonna happen.

14:04.440 --> 14:08.331
Going back to rehab
a second time was humbling.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.631
My mom was there for me.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.342
Well, maybe for you,
but lately with Spencer--

14:12.380 --> 14:13.415
Emily, this is not
the first time

14:13.450 --> 14:15.975
my mom thought Spencer
was messing with our family.

14:17.950 --> 14:19.019
JESSICA:
Alison, don't walk away.

14:19.050 --> 14:19.948
ALISON: I don't want
to talk about it.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.150
I want
to know more about it.

14:21.190 --> 14:22.179
I don't.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.949
I want to know
who did you ( indistinct).

14:23.990 --> 14:25.958
Mom, drop it.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.959
Well, you can't just let
someone walk all over you.

14:29.000 --> 14:29.898
Defend yourself.

14:29.930 --> 14:32.091
How? Okay, I don't
even know who they are.

14:32.130 --> 14:33.097
Well, you said
there were notes.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.038
They're anonymous.

14:34.070 --> 14:36.334
Are they on your phone?
Don't touch that.

14:36.370 --> 14:37.337
Is it Spencer?

14:37.370 --> 14:38.337
No.

14:38.370 --> 14:39.302
Why not?

14:39.340 --> 14:40.500
You know, she's always
been jealous of you.

14:40.540 --> 14:43.475
And she has plenty of reasons
to want to hurt this family.

14:43.510 --> 14:44.477
What does that mean?

14:44.510 --> 14:47.343
It means that I won't
allow you to be bullied.

14:47.380 --> 14:51.384
You fight fire with fire.
Smoke her out.

14:51.420 --> 14:53.559
JASON:
Spoken like a true debutante.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.251
How long have you been
sitting there?

15:00.430 --> 15:03.968
So your mother really believed
Spencer was after Ali.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.135
Look, I don't want
to get into this.

15:08.170 --> 15:10.035
My mom needs me right now
and I'm here to help her.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.674
So this bridal-thingy
sounds like

15:17.710 --> 15:19.246
it's for a good cause.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.542
Do you want to be my date?

15:20.580 --> 15:22.571
( cellphone vibrates )

15:22.620 --> 15:25.339
To Mrs. DiLaurentis' party?

15:25.390 --> 15:27.085
No. No.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.021
Does a bridal-show
hung up other Issues,

15:30.060 --> 15:32.358
like Ezra and Maggie
and their son?

15:32.390 --> 15:34.221
That's not why we broke up.

15:36.230 --> 15:37.697
( cellphone vibrating )

15:39.270 --> 15:40.692
Who keeps calling?
Is that Zack?

15:40.740 --> 15:41.968
Yes.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.300
He won't sleep until we speak,
and it is 3:00 am. in Vienna.

15:46.340 --> 15:47.739
( cellphone vibrating )

15:47.780 --> 15:49.634
Okay, take the call.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.079
You sure?
Yeah.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.274
Hello.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.538
Yes, I'm sitting with Aria
and she thinks

15:56.580 --> 15:59.117
you're a very persistent man.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.055
How are you?

16:05.060 --> 16:06.357
Do you miss me yet?

16:18.070 --> 16:19.037
( door opening )

16:19.070 --> 16:20.037
Hello?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.502
Who's there?

16:21.540 --> 16:22.575
It's just me.

16:25.510 --> 16:26.545
Getting some iced tea.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.189
You sleeping
down here tonight?

16:33.390 --> 16:35.051
Well, is that against
your rules?

16:35.090 --> 16:37.422
Don't bust my chops, Spencer.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.189
I think I've been
pretty generous WIth you.

16:39.230 --> 16:41.755
Generous?
How do you figure that?

16:41.800 --> 16:42.858
( cellphone buzzing )

16:42.900 --> 16:45.095
Well, I let you hang out
with your friends last night

16:45.130 --> 16:45.960
and I'm not even questioning

16:46.000 --> 16:47.194
why your knee
is buzzing right now.

16:49.670 --> 16:50.762
Go ahead.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.437
Answer your knee.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.074
But you should be
talking to me.

16:54.110 --> 16:55.077
Why?

16:55.110 --> 16:56.429
Well, that's why I'm here.

16:56.480 --> 17:00.348
You're not sleeping
and clearly you don't feel safe

17:00.380 --> 17:03.110
in your own house.

17:03.150 --> 17:04.412
Is that because your
parents aren't here?

17:04.450 --> 17:09.183
No. My parents are the ones
keeping me up.

17:09.220 --> 17:10.255
What are you reading?

17:10.290 --> 17:11.780
A book.

17:11.830 --> 17:13.627
Why are your parents
keeping you up?

17:13.660 --> 17:16.128
Because I have huge holes
in my brain

17:16.160 --> 17:17.696
about the summer
that my friend was killed

17:17.730 --> 17:20.290
and my parents refuse
to fill in the blanks.

17:20.340 --> 17:21.762
Can we please talk
about something else?

17:21.800 --> 17:23.700
Love at First Fight.

17:23.740 --> 17:24.707
What?

17:24.740 --> 17:27.277
It's a Jack Dempsey Story.

17:27.310 --> 17:28.277
He was a boxer.

17:28.310 --> 17:29.129
Came from a family like mine,

17:29.180 --> 17:33.276
where fighting
was a second language.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.312
Sounds like that
would put me to sleep.

17:36.350 --> 17:38.147
I'll give it a try.

17:38.190 --> 17:39.179
May I?

17:52.330 --> 17:53.558
Are you making more tea?

17:53.600 --> 17:55.761
No, I'm gonna go to bed.

17:55.800 --> 17:58.803
What? I thought
we were gonna talk.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.138
Yeah, well,
that moment passed.

18:01.180 --> 18:04.274
Aria, what just happened?

18:04.310 --> 18:06.778
Nothing.

18:06.810 --> 18:08.675
You went to Vienna
and you found your blIss,

18:08.720 --> 18:11.609
I stayed here
and I got kicked in the teeth.

18:11.650 --> 18:12.719
Night.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.581
Don't do that.
Don't push me away.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.611
_ You're not even
In thIs room, Mom.

18:18.560 --> 18:19.652
You've got
someone in your life

18:19.690 --> 18:21.123
who's clearly
more important than us.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.127
Don't be ridiculous.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.821
Nobody comes
before you or Mike.

18:23.870 --> 18:24.825
Really?

18:24.870 --> 18:26.019
Where have you been?

18:26.070 --> 18:29.335
Honey, you were the one that
convinced me to go with Zack.

18:29.370 --> 18:31.167
You practically
packed my suitcase.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.303
Okay, well,
maybe I was wrong, okay.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.433
And maybe you should
have packed a little less.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.276
Your kids live
in this country.

18:40.320 --> 18:45.189
So are you mad at me
or Ezra or yourself?

18:45.220 --> 18:47.188
No, don't make this
a teaching moment, okay.

18:47.220 --> 18:49.211
Oh, but you will be
very pleased

18:49.260 --> 18:50.625
to know that you were right.

18:50.660 --> 18:51.922
And it was
a huge frickin' mistake

18:51.960 --> 18:53.598
getting involved with him.

18:53.630 --> 18:55.291
So send me an
I-told-you-so card

18:55.330 --> 18:56.592
when you get back to Austria.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.166
Goodnight.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.619
Dean?

19:18.590 --> 19:19.784
Um, hello?

19:19.820 --> 19:21.378
Job description?
Get up.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.819
I'm sorry.
I must have fallen asleep.

19:22.860 --> 19:24.828
Yes, you must have
on top of my daughter

19:24.860 --> 19:26.657
which strikes me as just
a little inappropriate.

19:26.690 --> 19:27.793
Mom, what is going on?

19:27.830 --> 19:29.422
That was my question.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.529
But I don't need an answer.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.525
You can start packing.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.595
I think this arrangement
has lost its appeal.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.267
What?
Mom, nothing happened.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.528
You can spend
tonight in the barn,

19:36.570 --> 19:38.538
_ but tomorrow
WIll be your last day.

19:38.570 --> 19:39.730
I'm sorry you feel that way.

19:39.770 --> 19:41.476
I'm sorry I didn't listen
to my husband

19:41.510 --> 19:42.909
and hire the 60-year-old
Scottish woman

19:42.940 --> 19:43.770
with the diaper breath.

19:43.810 --> 19:46.278
Mom. Mom, he was just
reading to me.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.972
You read perfectly
well for yourself.

19:49.020 --> 19:50.419
Good night, Dean.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.536
Have you spoken
with her since?

20:07.570 --> 20:09.231
No. She's spending
the day with Mike.

20:09.270 --> 20:10.305
How about yours?

20:10.340 --> 20:12.729
Disinfecting the house
of all things Dean. Thanks.

20:13.940 --> 20:15.828
Look, have told her about
Jason's memory?

20:15.880 --> 20:17.745
Spencer, how are we
supposed to trust anything

20:17.780 --> 20:19.975
that Jason remembers
from that summer?

20:20.010 --> 20:22.444
His brain was soaked
In corn quuor.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.516
Jason thinks that he saw
CeCe that night

20:24.550 --> 20:26.711
wearing the exact
same outfit as Ali,

20:26.750 --> 20:28.308
and we all know that
CeCe's not the blonde

20:28.360 --> 20:29.452
that's in that grave.

20:29.490 --> 20:30.923
So who ended up
in that grave

20:30.960 --> 20:32.450
with the same clothes
All had on?

20:32.490 --> 20:34.799
Yeah, and if Mrs. D is "A,"

20:34.830 --> 20:36.889
why would she be going
after her own daughter?

20:36.930 --> 20:38.727
She's not going after her.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.330
Ali still doesn't know who tried
to kill her that night.

20:41.370 --> 20:42.792
That's the whole point.
Don't you guys get it?

20:42.840 --> 20:45.434
The person who went after
Ali could still be out there.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.039
Okay, if you guys have
plans tonight, break them.

20:50.080 --> 20:51.968
We're gonna put on
wedding dresses for charity.

20:52.010 --> 20:53.170
Are you out of your mind?

20:53.210 --> 20:56.338
My mom found a whole new bag
of clothes in Ali's bedroom.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.347
Slow down.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.789
Mrs. D knows
Ali's alive, Emily.

20:58.820 --> 21:00.458
I mean if she's getting
her new clothes,

21:00.490 --> 21:02.355
then she must know
where to send them.

21:02.390 --> 21:04.358
Okay, but why does
that mean

21:04.390 --> 21:06.278
that we have to go get
married in her baclqard?

21:06.330 --> 21:07.228
Because I'm betting

21:07.260 --> 21:09.649
that the address is somewhere
in that house.

21:09.700 --> 21:10.997
And we need a reason
to be in there

21:11.030 --> 21:12.463
so I volunteered
all four of us.

21:12.500 --> 21:13.660
( clearing throat)

21:14.700 --> 21:15.735
Morning, Hanna.

21:15.770 --> 21:16.759
Girls.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.937
Hi.

21:17.970 --> 21:20.530
I'm guessing you told your
friends about the anonymous tip.

21:24.550 --> 21:27.644
Look, I don't want to give
you guys any false hope.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.012
Alison's probably not alive,

21:30.050 --> 21:32.814
but if she is,
after all this time...

21:33.860 --> 21:35.851
there's going to be
a lot of questions,

21:35.890 --> 21:39.519
starting with who's
the dead girl in her grave.

21:43.430 --> 21:47.298
If you guys have any thoughts,
you know where to find me.

21:51.410 --> 21:54.299
So what time does your mom
want us to be there?

21:58.580 --> 22:01.674
Mom?
What are you doing?

22:01.720 --> 22:02.675
Where have you been?

22:02.720 --> 22:03.584
The Brew.

22:03.620 --> 22:05.349
Why are you going
through my drawers?

22:06.620 --> 22:07.814
When I gave Dean
his final check,

22:07.860 --> 22:09.418
he said that you've been
sleeping downstairs

22:09.460 --> 22:11.018
because you don't feel
safe up here.

22:11.060 --> 22:12.687
Is that true?

22:12.730 --> 22:14.049
Oh, God, mom.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.660
Why don't you feel safe?

22:16.700 --> 22:17.860
Is this about
not trustIng yourself?

22:17.900 --> 22:19.595
Is there some hidden
stash of pills?

22:19.630 --> 22:21.666
No, mom, I'm not the one
who's hiding things.

22:21.700 --> 22:22.860
That would be you and Dad.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.663
Excuse me?

22:24.710 --> 22:26.666
Every time I ask you guys
about that summer,

22:26.710 --> 22:29.076
you two put up a firewall.

22:29.110 --> 22:30.668
How do you expect me
to trust myself

22:30.710 --> 22:32.507
when my own parents
clearly don't?

22:32.550 --> 22:34.370
None of us want
to re-visit that time.

22:34.420 --> 22:35.409
It was harrowing,

22:35.450 --> 22:37.418
Okay?

22:37.450 --> 22:39.611
It was as _if there were
two of you lIVIng In thIs house,

22:39.650 --> 22:41.982
the Spencer we recognize
and your evil twin.

22:42.020 --> 22:44.352
And we never knew which one
was comIng down to breakfast.

22:45.930 --> 22:47.420
That's why I made
your sister promise that

22:47.460 --> 22:48.495
she would never
bring up that

22:48.530 --> 22:50.691
incident that happened
before she left for school.

22:50.730 --> 22:52.459
What incident?

22:53.900 --> 22:54.992
Mom,

22:55.040 --> 22:57.031
what incident?

23:09.120 --> 23:11.008
Alison?

23:11.050 --> 23:13.018
Sorry, Mrs. Hastings.

23:13.050 --> 23:15.086
I was just cutting through
to use our back door.

23:15.120 --> 23:18.021
It's, you know,
past my curfew.

23:18.060 --> 23:19.027
What happened?

23:19.060 --> 23:20.948
Nothing.
I'm-- I'm just--

23:21.000 --> 23:22.456
I'm cleaning up.

23:24.800 --> 23:28.167
Did Melissa and Spencer
have one of their fights?

23:28.200 --> 23:29.895
I know a crazy scissors
when I see one.

23:29.940 --> 23:32.659
Alison, please,
not tonight.

23:39.150 --> 23:40.139
Look, I can stay
and help you clean up.

23:40.180 --> 23:41.511
I don't want your help.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.541
Just...

23:44.820 --> 23:47.038
I want to understand this,
and I can't.

23:49.620 --> 23:52.589
What is happening to her?
Why is she acting like this?

23:55.100 --> 23:57.022
I wish I knew.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.096
But if I ask her,

23:59.130 --> 24:02.759
she might turn on me.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.165
Go home.
It's late.

24:04.210 --> 24:07.839
Your parents
are probably worried.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.621
You don't remember
any of thIs?

24:27.530 --> 24:28.519
Right.

24:30.230 --> 24:33.836
Well, your father and I
didn't know what to think

24:33.870 --> 24:36.065
when Alison disappeared
a few nights later.

24:36.100 --> 24:39.968
We've done everything we could
to protect you, Spencer.

24:40.010 --> 24:43.548
We know you're not a monster.

24:43.580 --> 24:44.399
Those pills were poison.

24:47.580 --> 24:49.912
But you need to leave
that summer alone.

24:51.550 --> 24:52.585
Please.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.934
Welcome to "Engaged to Change,"
a night to benefit--

25:46.970 --> 25:48.335
Save it.
I'm working this.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.574
Where do I park?

25:49.610 --> 25:52.078
Well, I'm not exactly sure--

25:52.110 --> 25:53.145
I'll park it for you.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.039
Wait, you're working this?

25:58.090 --> 26:01.059
_ You wouldn't catch me
In a pengum swt IfI wasn't.

26:02.960 --> 26:04.757
I like you as a penguin.

26:14.370 --> 26:16.588
* Spring is here

26:16.640 --> 26:19.666
* And the slq is so very blue

26:19.710 --> 26:23.908
* Whoa-o-o, birds all sing

26:23.950 --> 26:27.078
* as if they knew

26:27.110 --> 26:32.616
* Today's the day
we'll say "I do" *

26:32.650 --> 26:39.158
* And we'll never be
lonely anymore *

26:39.190 --> 26:42.899
* Because we're going
to the chapel *

26:42.930 --> 26:44.693
Is Jason even here?

26:44.730 --> 26:47.198
If he came to help his mother,
why wouldn't he be?

26:47.230 --> 26:49.698
Probably because
"chiffon versus taffeta"

26:49.740 --> 26:51.162
isn't where
he's most helpful.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.837
We're never getting upstairs.

26:52.870 --> 26:53.632
Why?

26:53.680 --> 26:55.204
The house
is event headquarters.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.776
We're not going to be
able to squeeze past

26:56.810 --> 26:59.005
Alison's mother
without her noticing.

26:59.050 --> 27:01.974
I'm luclq ifI can
squeeze out of this tent.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.745
Ladies, when you're finished
with your touch-ups,

27:06.790 --> 27:08.917
please remember to check
the list by the stage.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.986
Spencer, what happened
to your veil?

27:12.030 --> 27:13.793
Oh. I think I must have
left it inside

27:13.830 --> 27:15.388
Go get it, please.

27:15.430 --> 27:16.852
Now.

27:16.900 --> 27:17.889
Okay.

27:23.970 --> 27:25.130
Hi.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.772
I just forgot
my headgear.

27:31.150 --> 27:34.074
Look, Jason, I want to be very
clear about something, okay?

27:34.120 --> 27:36.111
I'm here to help
Hanna's mom.

27:36.150 --> 27:38.345
I didn't come here to get up
in your mother's grill.

27:38.390 --> 27:43.384
And I have been very
shaky recently,

27:43.420 --> 27:46.753
because, I don't know
if Emily told you, but,

27:46.790 --> 27:49.224
this time last week I was
playIng so|ItaIre at Ferndell.

27:49.260 --> 27:51.023
It's a rehab clinic.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.822
I know what it is.
Why were you there?

27:52.870 --> 27:54.269
Long story.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.029
But isn't it funny that
you and I always have

27:58.070 --> 27:59.731
more in common
than we thInk?

28:01.440 --> 28:02.839
I got to get this out
to the tent.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.007
Wait, Jason, can I just
ask you one thing?

28:06.250 --> 28:08.912
You once told Emily
that you had a memory

28:08.950 --> 28:11.942
of seeing my sister talk with
CeCe in your baclqard

28:11.990 --> 28:14.481
the night
that All disappeared.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.181
And you said that
you thought CeCe was Ali

28:16.220 --> 28:17.448
because they were
wearing the same clothes.

28:17.490 --> 28:20.186
What's your question?

28:20.230 --> 28:21.822
Are you sure it was CeCe?

28:21.860 --> 28:23.691
Could it have been
another blonde?

28:27.300 --> 28:29.165
Sorry for interrupting.
I...

28:29.200 --> 28:31.031
Dean, this is Jason.

28:31.070 --> 28:32.037
Hi.

28:32.070 --> 28:33.833
Hi.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.231
Jason, can we please
talk later?

28:38.950 --> 28:45.048
I just came by to say
good-bye and give you this.

28:46.250 --> 28:47.444
You know
you can call me,

28:47.490 --> 28:49.253
24/7.

28:49.290 --> 28:50.314
Y'hear?

28:51.990 --> 28:53.025
Thank you.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.389
Um...

29:00.400 --> 29:02.368
Um... that Jason,
now that was the same guy

29:02.400 --> 29:05.369
that you ran out to see
yesterday morning?

29:05.410 --> 29:08.231
Yeah. He's been gone
for a few months.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.874
He was at Clark Center.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.017
He told you that?

29:14.050 --> 29:16.143
Yeah. Why?

29:18.420 --> 29:20.411
Clark Center's been
closed for, like, 2 years.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.349
Be careful.

29:33.570 --> 29:36.266
You asked your
daughter and her friends

29:36.300 --> 29:37.961
to model the dresses?

29:38.010 --> 29:41.969
Well, we were short on time
and they offered.

29:42.010 --> 29:44.171
They offered or you asked?

29:47.950 --> 29:49.315
I'm sorry, Jessica.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.885
I really am sorry.

30:10.200 --> 30:13.909
You guys,
Jason wasn't in rehab.

30:13.940 --> 30:14.907
What?

30:14.940 --> 30:16.077
He lied.

30:16.110 --> 30:17.338
Where has he been
all this time?

30:17.380 --> 30:19.905
I don't know. Maybe in
Rosewood, helping Mommy.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.144
We have to get
into that bedroom.

30:25.090 --> 30:26.409
Aria, that's your cue.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.486
Emily, you're on deck.
Where's Hanna?

30:30.060 --> 30:32.051
Uh, I think she went
to the bathroom.

30:32.090 --> 30:35.059
In that outfit?
That's a lot of dress.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.294
All right, girls, follow me.
Come.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.661
Spencer?
Don't wander.

31:11.700 --> 31:12.928
You'll be up soon.

31:17.540 --> 31:18.529
Spencer?

31:18.570 --> 31:19.605
Coming.

31:30.520 --> 31:33.114
Hey, have you seen
Mrs. DiLaurentis?

31:33.150 --> 31:35.152
I'll tell her
you're looking for her.

31:35.190 --> 31:36.316
I'm_ not.
I'm just--

31:36.360 --> 31:37.679
I'm trying to avoid her.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.119
Okay.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.024
You trying to pull off

31:40.060 --> 31:41.698
some kind
of runaway bride thing, or...?

31:41.730 --> 31:43.595
No, look, me and
my friends are trying to get

31:43.630 --> 31:45.097
into her bedroom
without her knowing.

31:45.130 --> 31:48.588
So if you see her
could you just, like, stall her?

31:48.640 --> 31:49.698
Okay.

31:49.740 --> 31:50.490
Well, I'm not sure
if she and I have

31:50.540 --> 31:52.235
a whole lot
to chit-chat about.

31:52.270 --> 31:53.032
Please.

31:53.070 --> 31:54.571
Look, we just
have to get one thing

31:54.610 --> 31:56.009
and then we'll be
out of there.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.075
We've been trying
to get upstairs

31:57.110 --> 31:58.475
a couple of times
, but --

31:58.510 --> 32:00.148
Hanna, is this
the sort of thing

32:00.180 --> 32:01.579
that's eventually going
to involve a police line-up?

32:02.650 --> 32:04.186
Hey,

32:04.220 --> 32:05.687
can you
help me back up?

32:05.720 --> 32:07.142
_ Yeah.
Just gIve me a second.

32:07.190 --> 32:08.316
Yeah.

32:09.990 --> 32:11.150
Look, the thing is

32:11.190 --> 32:13.420
there's stuff
I haven't mentioned.

32:13.460 --> 32:15.098
You don't have to tell me.

32:16.730 --> 32:18.527
You had me at "could you."

32:20.600 --> 32:22.238
Are you ready?

32:22.270 --> 32:25.068
Just bring it back.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.463
Keep it coming.

32:26.510 --> 32:28.034
Keep coming.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.035
Keep coming.

32:29.080 --> 32:30.729
Keep coming.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.645
Good.

32:32.680 --> 32:33.669
Travis.

32:37.150 --> 32:38.742
Dude, what the hell?

32:38.790 --> 32:40.382
I am so sorry, man.

32:40.420 --> 32:41.512
That's my bad.

32:44.530 --> 32:47.021
Guess Mrs. DiLaurentis and I

32:47.060 --> 32:48.596
may have something
to talk about now.

32:48.630 --> 32:51.019
You're crazy.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.059
You know,
it's a little intimidating.

32:52.100 --> 32:55.592
You in this thing.

32:56.600 --> 32:57.635
Well, get over it.

33:16.460 --> 33:19.122
Is the mother-of—the-bride
allowed back here?

33:22.460 --> 33:23.597
When I saw you
on the runway,

33:23.630 --> 33:24.665
it took my
breath away.

33:26.670 --> 33:28.490
I was kind of glad
your father wasn't here,

33:28.540 --> 33:30.690
'cause when he
starts cryIng,

33:30.740 --> 33:33.129
I start bawling
and I would have

33:33.170 --> 33:34.307
embarrassed you even more.

33:34.340 --> 33:36.638
You don't embarrass me.

33:36.680 --> 33:37.704
Good.

33:39.480 --> 33:44.247
I know I may never get
to hear what happened with Ezra,

33:44.290 --> 33:46.713
but I do know that
he broke your heart.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.583
And if I was to tell you that

33:49.620 --> 33:53.420
sometimes what seems like
an endIng turns out to be--

33:53.460 --> 33:55.553
Mom?

33:55.600 --> 33:56.828
I'm not--

33:56.860 --> 33:59.124
I'm not ready to hear this.

33:59.170 --> 34:01.832
When I met your father
we were teenagers

34:01.870 --> 34:05.533
and I never expected
to be with anyone else.

34:05.570 --> 34:08.107
Neven

34:08.140 --> 34:12.577
But then one day,
things change,

34:12.610 --> 34:16.148
and it's over.

34:16.180 --> 34:19.718
And I'd be lying ifI said
it doesn't still hurt.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.149
It does.

34:21.190 --> 34:26.082
But it's like a broken bone
that's healed...

34:27.460 --> 34:30.054
and still throbs
every tIme It raIns.

34:34.200 --> 34:37.192
It doesn't feel like this
is ever gonna go away though.

34:37.240 --> 34:38.229
Sweetie,

34:38.270 --> 34:39.669
it will.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.531
It will. I promise.

34:44.410 --> 34:47.140
Look at me.

34:47.180 --> 34:48.272
I didn't even think
I would ever

34:48.320 --> 34:52.711
find someone who would
make me smile again, but I did.

34:55.360 --> 34:58.386
And the reason
Zack kept calling last night

34:58.430 --> 34:59.783
was because of you.

35:03.230 --> 35:06.529
He wanted to know
your reactIon.

35:09.800 --> 35:10.869
My reaction to what?

35:16.240 --> 35:17.332
He proposed?

35:17.380 --> 35:18.677
Oh, yeah,

35:18.710 --> 35:20.405
in two languages.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.888
Why didn't you
tell me yesterday?

35:24.920 --> 35:26.911
Because I wanted to discuss

35:26.950 --> 35:29.748
something more
important first.

35:29.790 --> 35:31.621
You.

35:31.660 --> 35:33.685
Mom.

35:33.730 --> 35:35.391
Oh, my God.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.295
Where did your mom
find the shopping bag?

35:43.640 --> 35:44.629
In here.

35:44.670 --> 35:46.206
But obviously it's gone now.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.242
Hey, Em.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.508
What's the name of that
restaurant you called?

36:01.560 --> 36:04.256
Mamma Gabusi's.
Why?

36:04.290 --> 36:05.325
Get your tablet.

36:07.660 --> 36:08.820
Look at this.

36:13.830 --> 36:15.866
Do you think that Ali's
been hiding out here?

36:15.900 --> 36:17.936
No, but it might mean
something to her.

36:17.970 --> 36:19.506
I have an idea.

36:23.780 --> 36:25.805
This is the email address
from the envelope.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.374
I'm trying to get
into the account.

36:32.250 --> 36:33.239
It worked.

36:33.290 --> 36:36.612
Mamma Gabusi's
was the password.

36:36.660 --> 36:37.809
What now?

36:37.860 --> 36:39.748
I'm sending a message.

36:44.870 --> 36:45.962
So now what?

36:46.000 --> 36:47.627
We wait.

37:05.450 --> 37:08.214
Alison, you out here?

37:50.730 --> 37:51.719
( metal cracking )

38:18.690 --> 38:19.918
Where have you been?

38:19.960 --> 38:21.052
I was with my mom.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.091
Where is Spencer?

38:22.130 --> 38:23.995
We thought she was with you.

38:24.030 --> 38:26.692
( cellphone ringing )

38:28.500 --> 38:29.569
It's block_ed.
Answer It.

38:32.610 --> 38:33.702
Hello?

38:33.740 --> 38:34.832
ALISON ( on phone ):
How did you find me?

38:37.480 --> 38:39.368
Okay, Ali, the police know
that it's not you.

38:39.410 --> 38:40.547
What?

38:40.580 --> 38:42.639
Buried. They know
that's not you in there.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.669
Alison,
does your mother know?

38:43.720 --> 38:45.517
No, don't speak
to my mother, okay?

38:45.550 --> 38:46.517
She can't know anything.

38:46.550 --> 38:47.585
Look, we want to help you,

38:47.620 --> 38:48.882
but you need to tell us
what happened that night.

38:48.920 --> 38:51.718
Then you need to come here.
And you need to hurry.

39:03.700 --> 39:04.962
You guys,
her phone's in here.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.159
That's why she's not
answering us.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.906
Wait, do you think Mrs. D
freaked her out and she left?

39:08.940 --> 39:10.874
No, she wouldn't do that.
Not without her stuff.

39:14.650 --> 39:16.811
Oh, my God, are you okay?
What happened?

39:16.850 --> 39:18.784
I saw Mrs. DiLaurentis
in the woods

39:18.820 --> 39:19.787
and I tried to follow her.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.117
What?

39:21.150 --> 39:22.686
She was giving
a suitcase to somebody.

39:22.720 --> 39:23.948
And I thought
maybe it was Ali.

39:23.990 --> 39:25.981
No, Ali's in Philadelphia.
We just spoke to her.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.429
Yeah. She told us
where to go meet her.

39:27.460 --> 39:28.722
What?

39:28.760 --> 39:29.920
Spencer, come on,
let's take this off. Let's go.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.052
Will you please help me?

39:37.440 --> 39:38.702
Oh my God.

39:39.810 --> 39:41.038
Are those finger bones?

39:46.510 --> 39:47.647
"What will you do
when the rest of me

39:47.680 --> 39:48.977
comes out of the grave?"

40:00.760 --> 40:02.057
I'm outside.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.727
ARIA ( on phone ): Did you
get a jacket for Spencer?

40:03.760 --> 40:05.022
She's still shaking.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.799
Yeah.
Where are you?

40:06.830 --> 40:08.764
Gassing up the car.
We'll be there in a minute.

40:08.800 --> 40:09.835
Okay.

40:11.610 --> 40:12.634
Hi.

40:14.610 --> 40:16.077
Paige, I can't talk now.
Aria's picking me up.

40:16.110 --> 40:17.099
Please hear me out.

40:17.140 --> 40:19.005
I can't hear
anymore excuses.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.699
I don't have any.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.674
I came to tell you,
you were right.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.041
You were right.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.785
I didn't just do it
because I care about

40:27.820 --> 40:29.856
what happens to you.

40:29.890 --> 40:32.586
I did it 'cause I don't care
about what happens to Alison.

40:32.630 --> 40:36.157
You're still so angry at her
you'd let somebody kill her?

40:38.000 --> 40:41.731
I love you.

40:41.770 --> 40:43.089
Please forgive me.

40:45.670 --> 40:46.967
I do forgive you.

40:49.110 --> 40:51.772
But I don't think I could
ever trust you agaIn.

40:51.810 --> 40:53.801
What are you saying?

41:01.920 --> 41:03.080
This does not look good.

41:05.790 --> 41:06.825
Good-bye.

41:35.220 --> 41:36.858
What was this place?

41:36.890 --> 41:40.929
Are you sure this is the address
Alison gave you?

41:40.960 --> 41:41.949
Yeah.

41:45.970 --> 41:47.892
This is where
she's been crashing?

41:54.210 --> 41:55.609
Em, you okay?

41:57.310 --> 41:58.572
Look, it's probably
a good thing

41:58.610 --> 42:00.669
you dealt with Paige
before you see Ali.

42:00.710 --> 42:02.143
It wasn't planned.

42:02.180 --> 42:03.716
It never is.

42:09.590 --> 42:10.557
( knocking on door)

42:10.590 --> 42:12.854
Ali?

42:12.890 --> 42:14.187
Alison, are you in there?

42:15.730 --> 42:16.799
( door opening )

42:18.330 --> 42:19.820
What are you doing here?

42:21.870 --> 42:23.132
I'll have the bellboy
get your bags.

42:43.990 --> 42:48.757
( phone ringing )

42:48.800 --> 42:49.926
WOMAN ( on phone ):
Rosewood Police Department.

42:49.960 --> 42:50.949
How may I direct your call?
