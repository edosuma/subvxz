Hmm.

00:35.635 --> 00:36.659
Whoa!

00:36.736 --> 00:38.863
Marceline.
Marceline, I'm open.

00:38.938 --> 00:40.235
I'm wide open.

00:40.306 --> 00:43.036
Marceline, I got ups!
Check out my ups!

00:43.109 --> 00:44.872
Nope!

00:44.944 --> 00:45.968
Too slow!

00:46.046 --> 00:46.876
Whoa!

00:48.915 --> 00:50.849
Yeah!

00:50.917 --> 00:52.578
All right. Good game.
Good game.

00:52.652 --> 00:55.018
Take five.

00:55.088 --> 00:57.488
I'll get us all a bunch
of little waters.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.491
Marceline, why'd you invite
Ancient Chubs

00:59.559 --> 01:02.255
to play basketball?
- Yeah!

01:04.831 --> 01:07.664
Well, he's very...
dear to my heart.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.099
I love him.

01:09.169 --> 01:11.296
Whatchoo are talking
about, Marceline?

01:11.371 --> 01:13.362
We've been around
for a long time.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.431
We have a long history
together.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.066
It's... it's a long story.

01:17.143 --> 01:19.737
- Lay it on us.
- Yeah! Lay it out, Marcy.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.373
Ye-e-ah, lay down, Marceline!
Go to sleep!

01:22.449 --> 01:24.440
Right?
What are we talking about?

01:24.517 --> 01:26.041
All right.

01:26.119 --> 01:28.849
Suppose it's about time
I told someone this story.

01:38.164 --> 01:39.893
Hmm.

01:39.966 --> 01:40.898
Ha ha!

01:40.967 --> 01:42.992
Might be something in here,
Marceline.

01:44.070 --> 01:46.095
Ewwww!

01:46.172 --> 01:47.867
It's a dead rat!

01:47.941 --> 01:49.932
Hey, yeah.
So it is.

01:50.009 --> 01:52.307
Looks like we've got a cute
new traveling buddy!

01:52.378 --> 01:53.367
Ew! No!

01:53.446 --> 01:55.437
He's kind of cute.

01:59.085 --> 02:01.747
Hey, check it out...
a VHS tape.

02:01.821 --> 02:04.688
You wanna watch a movie?
- Yeah.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.951
Man, this is a boring movie.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.097
I liked the book
much better.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.000
You're so silly, Simon.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.366
Yeah, I suppose so.

02:17.437 --> 02:20.304
Huh?

02:20.373 --> 02:21.567
What is that?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.666
I'm not sure,
but it's coming our way.

02:23.743 --> 02:26.541
Come on.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.046
Marcy, you stay in the car.

02:28.114 --> 02:29.638
I'll be right back.
- Simon!

02:29.716 --> 02:31.308
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

02:31.384 --> 02:33.375
You're not going
to put it on, are you?

02:33.453 --> 02:35.387
I <i>have</i> to...
to protect us.

02:35.455 --> 02:37.286
But you're gonna act
weird again.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.825
Don't worry.
I can control it better now.

02:40.960 --> 02:44.452
It's okay.
B. R. B.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.195
Oh, boy. Here it comes.
Oh, bread balls.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.759
Oh, bread balls.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.771
Oh,
bread balls!

03:00.079 --> 03:03.571
I call upon the power
of ice and snow!

03:03.650 --> 03:06.312
Ice winds, blo-o-o-o-w!

03:10.790 --> 03:13.987
You will no longer terrify
a 47-year-old man

03:14.060 --> 03:16.460
and a 7-year-old girl!

03:20.767 --> 03:23.167
Simon, stop! It's frozen!

03:23.236 --> 03:26.034
Not now, Gunther.
I'm doing big-people things.

03:26.105 --> 03:28.096
Play in the snow.
Build me a snowman.

03:28.174 --> 03:30.506
Eugh!

03:35.415 --> 03:37.042
Heh?

03:38.184 --> 03:40.152
Simon!
Simon, are you okay?

03:41.621 --> 03:42.986
Uh... y-yeah.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.683
You're getting worse, Simon.

03:44.757 --> 03:46.782
Your hair and your nose
are longer.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.690
And you started to hover
in the air!

03:48.761 --> 03:52.390
Oh, yeah?
Did I look pretty fly?!

03:54.100 --> 03:56.728
What are you talking about?
You're scaring me.

03:59.839 --> 04:01.739
I-I'm sorry.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.275
Did I say something?

04:03.343 --> 04:06.574
Simon, promise me
you won't put it on again.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.473
Okay. I promise.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.279
What <i>is</i> that thing?

04:12.352 --> 04:15.378
It's a deer.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.620
If there are deers
in the forest,

04:18.690 --> 04:21.558
do you think there are
other things?

04:21.628 --> 04:23.653
I don't know.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.391
Hmm.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.995
This is gonna be good.

04:30.069 --> 04:31.730
This is gonna be worth it.

Hey, little lady,
how about a ride

07:21.841 --> 07:23.604
on an old man's back?
Hmm?

07:23.676 --> 07:26.338
I can walk.
I'm not a child, Simon.

07:26.412 --> 07:29.006
Look, sweetie, someday,
you'll be too big to hold.

07:29.081 --> 07:30.776
I'm as old as garlic balls.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.511
If someone offered to pick <i>me</i> up
and carry me,

07:32.585 --> 07:34.883
I'd do it in a heartbeat.
Take it while you can get it.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.184
