00:49.384 --> 00:53.054
Now let me tell you
a little bit about before your time.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.223
Some misguided fools

00:55.390 --> 00:58.935
couldn't quite warm up to the idea
of bowing down to me.

00:59.102 --> 01:01.229
They wanted my business,

01:01.396 --> 01:04.022
but they didn't have
the skill that we have.

01:04.190 --> 01:07.944
See, I got a background.

01:08.111 --> 01:11.990
See, I worked for the government
for a long time.

01:12.157 --> 01:14.617
And I learned from the best.

01:14.784 --> 01:18.079
And I took my skills
after I left the government,

01:18.246 --> 01:19.789
brought 'em here to do what I do.

01:19.956 --> 01:22.417
So they sent about...

01:22.584 --> 01:24.961
four or five hit teams out.

01:25.128 --> 01:29.591
Man, it must have been
like 12, 13 people.

01:29.758 --> 01:32.093
And, well, my boy and I,

01:32.260 --> 01:36.181
we sent them all back dead in a box.

01:36.347 --> 01:38.141
Some of them,
we cut their heads off

01:38.308 --> 01:41.311
and gift wrapped 'em,
got creative and stuff.

01:41.478 --> 01:43.104
Really made a statement, you know?

01:43.271 --> 01:45.774
I think that was the last time I left.

01:46.983 --> 01:50.862
And that was the last time
I questioned this young man's integrity.

02:14.469 --> 02:16.429
All it takes

02:16.596 --> 02:21.184
is one dumb motherfucker
to come in

02:21.351 --> 02:23.853
and try to tear everything down.

02:26.606 --> 02:28.983
You broke the code, Sasha.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.152
You a motherfuckin' rat.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.780
Please.

02:33.947 --> 02:37.659
Mr. Alexander, don't kill me.

02:37.826 --> 02:39.494
Give me chance to redeem myself.

02:39.661 --> 02:43.540
Now I gots to get involved
myself personally.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.297
You understand?

02:52.674 --> 02:55.260
I'm gonna have to make
an example out of you.

02:56.970 --> 02:59.681
You want to redeem yourself?

02:59.848 --> 03:02.100
See,

03:02.267 --> 03:06.604
I don't want to use
the word seppuku,

03:06.771 --> 03:10.483
'cause that has something to do
with folks who had honor,

03:10.650 --> 03:13.027
which you don't have.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.238
So why don't you cut
your motherfucking throat,

03:15.405 --> 03:16.865
or I'll do it for you?

03:27.208 --> 03:29.210
Ah! God!

04:02.911 --> 04:04.078
Ah!

04:26.017 --> 04:28.353
I think I need to get a new suit, man.

04:28.519 --> 04:30.897
This motherfucker got me all dirty.
Look at this shit.

04:31.064 --> 04:33.066
Believe that?

04:56.798 --> 04:58.925
See these here guns?

05:01.844 --> 05:03.471
They were bought with my blood.

05:03.638 --> 05:05.890
And now I'm giving them to you.

05:06.057 --> 05:10.228
Now you delivered me Sasha,
and I appreciate that.

05:10.395 --> 05:13.523
That's how you work your way
to the top and earn my trust.

05:13.690 --> 05:15.316
Now you're by my side, right?

05:21.239 --> 05:24.492
I've got a job you're gonna
have to finish.

05:24.659 --> 05:27.245
And it's gonna be a long road.

05:27.412 --> 05:29.372
But you can do it.

05:31.207 --> 05:32.291
All right?

05:36.921 --> 05:39.215
Not a problem.

05:44.470 --> 05:46.347
We have to send a message.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.100
We're gonna take out a mark,
and Dante set it up with his crew.

05:49.267 --> 05:51.185
They on the inside.

05:51.352 --> 05:54.230
I just need confirmation
when it's done.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.493
There'll be a prison transfer.

06:07.660 --> 06:10.079
You're gonna have a small window,
do you hear?

06:13.541 --> 06:15.793
Confirm the mark,
do the job and get out,

06:15.960 --> 06:17.837
destroy the envelope after you read it.

06:18.004 --> 06:20.214
You know the drill.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.632
All right.

06:24.260 --> 06:26.721
Don't fail me, Hurst.

06:59.337 --> 07:01.339
New transfer coming in.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.844
Time-- 10:29.

07:07.011 --> 07:09.889
A secure. B secure.

07:10.056 --> 07:11.432
Pod C secure.

07:16.854 --> 07:20.274
Okay, you rug heads,
30 minutes fun time.

07:22.401 --> 07:24.153
I remember the first time
I stabbed him.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.907
There was that one
in a white state prison, right?

07:28.074 --> 07:31.160
I was on a mission to stab
this one rat nigger, Monster, right?

07:33.496 --> 07:35.623
It was the same damn time, right?

07:35.790 --> 07:38.709
'Cause I get behind
the nigger Monster, right?

07:38.876 --> 07:41.921
Homies tend to hit the nigger
in the lungs first, right?

07:42.088 --> 07:43.589
Shut the nigger down.

07:50.388 --> 07:52.306
The next thing I know,

07:52.473 --> 07:54.016
he jumped on my motherfuckin' back.

07:54.183 --> 07:55.309
We were wrestling.

07:55.476 --> 07:58.187
I threw the nigger.
Piledrive the nigger down, right?

07:58.354 --> 08:01.649
I stabbed this nigger, like,
five or six times, maybe 15.

08:38.102 --> 08:40.479
About to go down, baby.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.315
That's what's up.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.525
Young nigger get to put some work in.

08:52.283 --> 08:55.286
Motherfucking knife
in the neck the first time,

08:55.453 --> 08:58.956
pulling that shit out--
blood and everything.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.256
It's easy.

09:07.423 --> 09:09.717
'Cause I can't even feel it, right?

09:09.884 --> 09:11.969
Next thing I know,

09:12.136 --> 09:14.430
he jumped
on my motherfuckin' back.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.229
I stabbed this nigger,
like, five or six times.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.484
I get to jag
on this nigger Monster, right?

09:26.651 --> 09:29.237
Goin' back and forth with Monster
and this other guy, right?

09:42.792 --> 09:45.503
Mr. Alexander says
to grab Mr. Henry.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.129
Contact is Iceman.

09:47.296 --> 09:49.966
Tank boss-- Black Benny.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.968
Hurst, you getting this?

10:03.813 --> 10:06.482
Where you goin', cuz?
Where you goin'?

10:06.649 --> 10:09.235
Why you so nervous?

10:09.402 --> 10:11.862
Anyway, I--
I'm on this nigger, right?

10:12.029 --> 10:14.740
Cheese-eater must die!

10:15.783 --> 10:18.953
Come get this cheese,
you fuckin' rat!

10:21.831 --> 10:24.083
You fuckin' rat!

10:24.250 --> 10:27.503
Come get this cheese,
you fuckin' rat!

10:27.670 --> 10:29.797
Fuckin' rat!

10:33.217 --> 10:36.721
Come get this cheese,
you fuckin' rat!

10:36.887 --> 10:39.682
Fuckin' jigs always try to stir it up,
unravel cell wars.

10:41.434 --> 10:44.478
I'm gonna go knock some sense
into that jackin' bulldog.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.400
Wait, transfer's gone.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.326
You fuckin' rat!

10:58.492 --> 10:59.869
Come get this cheese,

11:00.036 --> 11:01.370
you fuckin' rat!

11:01.537 --> 11:03.456
Where Benny at?

11:03.622 --> 11:05.958
Man, that stupid motherfucker
done drifted off.

11:06.125 --> 11:08.169
I'm fixin' to go get strapped.
I'll be right back.

11:08.336 --> 11:11.255
That J-Bird gonna be
a dead nigger soon, you ask me.

11:11.422 --> 11:14.216
Why don't you come out here,
you fuckin' rat?!

12:08.604 --> 12:10.231
He's not the one.

12:13.442 --> 12:15.694
The one is behind you.

12:31.669 --> 12:34.004
You dead, Benny.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.641
You killed the wrong motherfucker!

12:45.808 --> 12:47.977
You was supposed to kill Benny,
motherfucker!

14:10.518 --> 14:12.353
Hurst, talk to me.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.063
It's done.

14:14.230 --> 14:16.190
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

15:20.796 --> 15:22.798
Constantine.

15:26.594 --> 15:28.929
Well, your palms
are really itching now.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.057
I learned from the best.

15:32.224 --> 15:33.767
Ain't that right?

15:33.934 --> 15:35.936
Free of the drama.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.104
You know Dante.

15:39.398 --> 15:40.774
Of course.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.028
Take my girls.

15:44.194 --> 15:46.238
Give me a little break here.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.792
Dante is aware that I sent you there

15:58.959 --> 16:02.004
to personally close this issue.

16:02.171 --> 16:05.090
Problem is you took out
the wrong brother.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.636
You deaf or something, white boy?

16:08.802 --> 16:12.890
My little shadow boy here
is good at what he do.

16:13.057 --> 16:15.809
And that's why I felt that

16:15.976 --> 16:17.770
him and I always gotta be good.

16:17.936 --> 16:21.357
That's the first time in 15 years
he's missed a mark.

16:21.523 --> 16:23.984
So I'm fixin' to find out
what happened there.

16:24.151 --> 16:27.988
But in the meantime,
you need to know we have rules.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.823
And we got respect.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.533
I respect you, I respect him.

16:31.700 --> 16:35.663
But if somebody fuck up,
somebody gotta face the music, so...

16:35.829 --> 16:38.040
I killed the man
marked by our contact.

16:41.710 --> 16:45.172
But if I made a mistake,

16:45.339 --> 16:47.549
then I'm willing to take
the consequences.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.844
You see,
he's a man until the end.

16:51.011 --> 16:54.765
Now I can't have you
missing no mark.

16:54.932 --> 16:59.395
In the meantime, I can't be embarrassed
by my business associates.

16:59.561 --> 17:04.191
So there gonna have to be
some kind of consequence.

17:04.358 --> 17:05.693
For now you've retired.

17:11.949 --> 17:14.034
I want him dead, Mr. Alexander.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.869
I'll let you do
whatever you got to do.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.330
- Don't kill him.
- Fucker! Fuck you!

17:19.498 --> 17:20.874
Don't kill him.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.041
Stay with me, motherfucker!

17:22.209 --> 17:23.627
- Wake up. Stay with me!
- Ah!

17:23.794 --> 17:25.628
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

17:25.796 --> 17:27.881
- I said bow down, motherfucker!
- Ah!

17:28.048 --> 17:29.299
Fuck you!

17:29.466 --> 17:31.260
Ooh!

17:31.427 --> 17:34.179
Better be glad Mr. Alexander
got a hard-on for your ass.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.014
The man with a plan
says you can live?

17:36.181 --> 17:38.976
- A'ight. You can live.
- Fucker.

17:39.143 --> 17:41.395
We ain't done yet.
He only needs one motherfuckin' hand.

17:41.562 --> 17:43.188
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.566
You see that motherfucker?
You see that motherfucker?

17:45.733 --> 17:48.485
It's clean right now, baby.
It's clean right now.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.779
Now here's what I want.
Here's what I want right here.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.281
Guess what, dog?

17:52.448 --> 17:55.743
Man says you go home broke,
consider yourself broke, motherfucker!

18:49.463 --> 18:51.089
I'm puzzled.

18:51.256 --> 18:54.426
He killed Dre,
my tank boss inside.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.094
Well, I'm fixin' to figure out

18:56.261 --> 18:59.181
if and how he made the mistake.

18:59.348 --> 19:01.850
But in the meantime,

19:02.017 --> 19:05.229
I can't have you missing no mark.

19:05.395 --> 19:09.691
In the meantime, I can't be embarrassed
by my business associates.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.860
For now you've retired.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.998
Hey, Oso.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.042
Aw, come on.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.211
Put 'em in the cans for once.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.548
Go upstairs.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.424
Leave the departamento.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.469
Hurry up, Oso!

19:39.847 --> 19:41.807
You take breaks every 10 minutes.

19:41.974 --> 19:43.809
The kitchen is behind already.

19:43.976 --> 19:45.686
Talk to the drunk.

19:45.853 --> 19:48.063
Yeah.

19:50.899 --> 19:52.693
Had enough to drink?

21:30.624 --> 21:33.418
Hey, yo, man.
How you feelin'?

21:42.260 --> 21:44.137
See, in the past,

21:44.304 --> 21:46.974
every time we went to war,

21:47.140 --> 21:49.309
we always fought side by side.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.436
You paid for your mistake.

21:51.603 --> 21:55.065
Now it's time to get better,
time to get your strength back.

21:57.943 --> 22:00.028
They took my hands.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.617
I can't help you anymore.

22:05.784 --> 22:09.579
Yeah, well, I ain't asking
for your help at all.

22:10.664 --> 22:14.084
I'm fixin' to get you some money
and ask you to leave.

22:14.251 --> 22:17.879
Get out of here, go as far
as you can go, start a new life.

22:18.046 --> 22:21.091
If I get through this okay,
we'll hook up again.

22:21.258 --> 22:23.343
You're family.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.182
It's like that.

23:00.589 --> 23:02.591
I was inside for two years.

23:02.758 --> 23:04.051
Now that I'm out,

23:04.217 --> 23:06.887
I'm curious to know
why your boy wasted Dre

23:07.054 --> 23:10.140
instead of that piece-of-shit weasel
you put the green light on.

23:10.307 --> 23:12.642
That's the distant past.

23:12.809 --> 23:15.187
But for now, it'd be really good

23:15.353 --> 23:19.733
if you could tell me
something relevant right quick.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.695
You like games?

23:23.862 --> 23:24.988
No, sir.

23:25.155 --> 23:28.575
Well, I think I got a game
that you gonna like.

23:29.743 --> 23:32.829
How'd you like to play
"Pop the Pifiata"

23:32.996 --> 23:35.082
with old Benny the rat himself?

23:35.248 --> 23:38.001
- Tell me.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

23:38.168 --> 23:39.836
Yeah, we got him.

23:40.003 --> 23:43.256
It's a gift from 6-0 to you

23:43.423 --> 23:44.883
to show our respect.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.927
- That right?
- That's right.

23:48.929 --> 23:50.806
Man, if that's true,

23:50.972 --> 23:53.934
you might could have a job,

23:54.101 --> 23:56.937
iceman-- Ice?
Iceman?

23:57.104 --> 23:59.523
You can call me Ice.

24:00.524 --> 24:03.193
Ice.
Mr. Ice.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.780
Cool. Well, you can call me
Mr. Alexander.

24:06.947 --> 24:08.281
Who you with?

24:08.448 --> 24:12.619
Rich-rollin' 60 Crips,
Mr. Alexander.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.287
Not no more.

24:14.454 --> 24:16.957
You fixin' to roll with me now.

24:17.124 --> 24:19.459
Oh, that's our neighborhood.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.877
Neighborhood.

24:22.295 --> 24:26.091
Let's start by delivering
your gift to Dante.

24:26.258 --> 24:28.426
Make sure he do things right.

24:28.593 --> 24:30.178
Oh, yeah, he's gonna do what he do.

24:30.345 --> 24:34.057
We gonna do it the 6-0 way--
all day, every day.

24:38.436 --> 24:40.147
Sure enough.

24:41.815 --> 24:44.109
Let's go to work.

24:44.276 --> 24:46.611
Thank you for your time, sir.

24:46.778 --> 24:48.530
Thanks are mine, y'all.

25:08.717 --> 25:11.553
You rat fuck!

25:11.720 --> 25:14.431
I got a special ass-fucking
for you rattin' on the BTF.

25:18.977 --> 25:23.190
But I saved a little something special
for what you did to Dre.

25:23.356 --> 25:26.818
- What the fuck?
- That's right-- what the fuck?

25:26.985 --> 25:28.904
If I were you, I'd let him down.

25:29.070 --> 25:33.366
Let him die like the rat fuck he is,
begging for his life,

25:33.533 --> 25:36.453
not tied up like some damn pifiata.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.288
You know who you're talking to?

25:40.582 --> 25:43.168
The man who used to have the bat.

26:10.237 --> 26:13.073
Benny, look around you.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.951
Go ahead, look around you.

26:16.117 --> 26:19.746
See, all these folks got a reason
to have you dead.

26:19.913 --> 26:21.498
Me?

26:21.665 --> 26:24.709
I'm just interested in having you
pay back Mr. Alexander.

26:24.876 --> 26:26.586
Enough of this shit.

26:36.930 --> 26:38.640
You ain't done yet?

26:38.807 --> 26:40.892
Oh. Oh, okay.

26:41.059 --> 26:42.769
All right, come on.

26:47.816 --> 26:50.110
Yeah.
You see that?

26:53.113 --> 26:54.781
Come on, all right.

26:58.576 --> 27:00.370
Now we done, bitch.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.127
Now,

27:07.294 --> 27:10.046
why don't you let me and my boys
do the housekeeping?

27:10.213 --> 27:12.132
You go on back
and tell Mr. Alexander

27:12.299 --> 27:16.636
that his pit bull needs a muzzle

27:16.803 --> 27:19.723
or he could end up like Benny here.

27:19.889 --> 27:21.725
I ain't doing shit.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.148
Knock some sense into this nigger.

27:36.197 --> 27:38.158
Come on!
Get up, get up!

27:41.870 --> 27:43.663
Oh, come on!

27:49.878 --> 27:52.172
Tell him your damn self.

27:53.340 --> 27:55.008
That's our 'hood.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.751
Didn't I fuck you last week?

28:30.752 --> 28:32.879
Stop wasting my dick time.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.730
Would you like a translation, bitch?

28:52.941 --> 28:56.403
No, but I want you to go run
tell your boss

28:56.569 --> 28:59.739
that from now on,
any product he moves in my club,

28:59.906 --> 29:01.866
I get 10%.

29:02.033 --> 29:03.618
Now we 6-0, baby,

29:03.785 --> 29:06.079
and we don't accept no apologies.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.082
Adios, motherfucker.

29:11.501 --> 29:14.712
I got a job for you--
shaking your ass.

29:14.879 --> 29:17.424
Shake your ass.
Got a job for you, bitch.

29:17.590 --> 29:19.342
Shake your ass.
Got a job for you, bitch.

29:19.509 --> 29:20.510
Shake your ass.

29:20.677 --> 29:22.137
Shake your ass.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.681
Shake your ass.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.976
Sorry mama-ass nigger.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.582
Oye, hombre,
I told you not to call me

29:50.748 --> 29:52.292
until the shipment was delivered.

29:52.459 --> 29:53.460
Here you go.

29:53.626 --> 29:56.171
Let me know if you need
anything else, okay?

30:00.049 --> 30:02.802
Asshole, I can't understand you.

30:05.722 --> 30:08.224
Speak English or Spanish,
but pick one.

30:10.477 --> 30:12.103
Manny?

30:22.155 --> 30:24.157
Something's wrong.

30:25.533 --> 30:26.534
Talk to me.

30:26.701 --> 30:28.244
We have a problem with Cesare.

30:28.411 --> 30:30.205
Constantine is taking care of it now.

30:30.371 --> 30:32.665
Copy that.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.876
Here's that Infinity
I was telling you about.

30:35.043 --> 30:37.295
An amazing gun--
long slide, wide body.

30:37.462 --> 30:40.006
Got almost 15 rounds in a .45.
Can you imagine?

30:40.173 --> 30:43.092
Very accurate.
Spectacular pistol.

30:43.259 --> 30:45.845
This is that .50
I was telling you about.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.890
Guncrafter-- amazing.

30:49.057 --> 30:52.352
Flat, fast, no overpenetration,
great distance.

30:52.519 --> 30:55.396
You know, great velocity.

30:55.563 --> 30:59.734
Here's one
of my Longslide Caspian .45s

30:59.901 --> 31:01.319
that I've carried a lot around.

31:01.486 --> 31:02.862
Beautiful gun.

31:05.156 --> 31:06.783
Series 70 Colt,

31:06.950 --> 31:09.702
1938 National Match.

31:09.869 --> 31:13.748
It was one of the smallest .45s
ever made.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.042
It's one of my backups--
one of my personal backups.

31:16.209 --> 31:17.752
Isn't that amazing?

31:20.380 --> 31:23.424
The only reason he lets you
operate in this city, ese,

31:23.591 --> 31:27.720
is because you draw a lot of heat
away from him.

31:27.887 --> 31:32.141
Kind of defeats the purpose
if he's in fucking business with you.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.227
And I'm finished here.

31:56.958 --> 32:00.795
I spoke with Cesare.
Now let's go fix this mess.

32:48.051 --> 32:50.386
What you got in the bag, ese?

32:50.553 --> 32:52.930
Groceries.
You want dinner?

32:53.097 --> 32:55.308
I look like a fucking cook to you?

33:01.939 --> 33:04.192
Hey, keep walking, puto.

33:12.617 --> 33:14.661
Now what say you give me
that box?

33:14.827 --> 33:16.663
No, I can't do that, ese.

33:16.829 --> 33:18.956
I said give me
the fuckin' box, homes.

33:51.614 --> 33:53.324
How'd you do that?

33:53.491 --> 33:55.743
You didn't even use your hands.

34:06.671 --> 34:08.380
Not bad for a cripple.

34:58.639 --> 35:01.142
I fuckin' hate this town.

35:01.309 --> 35:03.603
Nowhere to find a good burger
after midnight.

35:03.770 --> 35:05.897
Kitchen closes in 15 minutes.

35:09.317 --> 35:10.943
Your burgers any good?

35:11.110 --> 35:12.612
The best in town.

35:13.654 --> 35:15.490
Make yourselves at home.

35:40.765 --> 35:42.433
You dropped this.

35:46.312 --> 35:47.522
Thank you.

35:51.776 --> 35:53.236
Hey.

35:54.237 --> 35:55.571
Hey.

35:57.824 --> 35:59.325
Don't I know you?

36:06.290 --> 36:08.543
Doubt it.

36:36.696 --> 36:40.199
Hey, you know them black dudes?

36:40.366 --> 36:43.244
Keep 'em away from Karen, all right?

36:43.411 --> 36:46.038
Her old man is like my ace deuce.

36:46.205 --> 36:48.749
Kind of makes her a daughter.

36:48.916 --> 36:51.711
So keep the trash away from her.

36:51.878 --> 36:55.089
Then why don't you pick up
the trash yourself for once?

37:22.700 --> 37:24.785
So what's so important
about that box of yours?

37:24.952 --> 37:27.663
Special ingredients
used for my cooking.

37:31.709 --> 37:33.419
What happened
to your hands, anyhow?

37:33.586 --> 37:35.588
I'll tell you all about it.

37:37.340 --> 37:39.342
Gotta shut her down.

37:39.508 --> 37:41.928
Can't afford to lose
my liquor license.

37:46.182 --> 37:48.100
You know who owns this place, right?

37:48.267 --> 37:51.729
Starts with Alexander,
ends with don't-even-think-about-it.

37:51.896 --> 37:55.399
So Mr. Alexander,
he own you too?

37:57.985 --> 37:59.946
Your tab.

38:00.112 --> 38:01.948
Added an extra $26

38:02.114 --> 38:04.867
for the two hours OT I owe Oso
for hanging around.

38:05.034 --> 38:08.412
Pay it, you can come back.

38:15.586 --> 38:18.381
I don't think she likes me.

38:18.547 --> 38:22.802
I know goddamn well
that nasty OG don't like me.

38:22.969 --> 38:24.470
Fuck him.

38:26.138 --> 38:27.682
Don't fuck with me.

38:27.848 --> 38:29.976
If Mr. Alexander says no,

38:30.142 --> 38:31.936
I gotta eat it.

38:32.103 --> 38:33.854
That's life.

38:35.189 --> 38:37.733
You sound like you scared
of that name.

38:38.859 --> 38:40.236
Mr. Cabron,

38:40.403 --> 38:43.155
Mr. Alexander has
a lot of triggers he can pull

38:43.322 --> 38:45.825
if we go to a ground war.

38:45.992 --> 38:49.161
And I don't feel like
getting shot today.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.289
I don't know,
maybe it's just me.

38:56.460 --> 38:57.920
Mm-hmm.

39:02.466 --> 39:06.178
Peep this-- Constantine runs
the chop shops.

39:06.345 --> 39:08.264
Right?

39:08.431 --> 39:10.016
Not for long.

39:10.182 --> 39:11.517
You feel me?

39:11.684 --> 39:15.229
Mr. Alexander wants your product.

39:15.396 --> 39:18.274
But he wants it done quietly.
The quieter, the better.

39:18.441 --> 39:21.569
That's where a nigger like me
comes in.

39:21.736 --> 39:24.113
I'm gonna say this
and I'm only gonna say it once.

39:24.280 --> 39:26.073
Jimmy Falcone is dead.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.325
I own this club.

39:28.492 --> 39:30.494
I'm about to own
the chop shops too.

39:30.661 --> 39:32.705
That's our neighborhood,
you feel me?

39:43.466 --> 39:44.800
A gift.

39:54.852 --> 39:57.188
That could be your future.

40:03.611 --> 40:07.615
One more thing--
we partners now.

40:07.782 --> 40:09.909
Once I cap Constantine,

40:10.076 --> 40:14.038
I expect 10% of everything we move
through the chop shop.

40:14.205 --> 40:15.873
Okay.

40:18.584 --> 40:20.628
Vamonos.

40:42.399 --> 40:44.276
Hey-

40:49.448 --> 40:51.367
Oh, you bitches, you.

41:13.639 --> 41:15.683
Oso made you some food.

41:15.850 --> 41:19.520
He wanted me to tell you
thank you for your help.

41:41.333 --> 41:44.253
Thank you for your help...

41:44.420 --> 41:46.172
Roman.

42:27.546 --> 42:28.881
Hurst.

42:29.048 --> 42:31.800
I'm sorry to call.
I just--

42:31.967 --> 42:33.302
How you feelin'?

42:33.469 --> 42:36.889
Alive, which is more than I can say
for Constantine.

42:39.683 --> 42:41.894
- It was a hit.
- Yeah, I heard.

42:42.061 --> 42:43.604
Look, I just want to warn you,
if Constantine is dead,

42:43.771 --> 42:44.772
then that means--

42:44.939 --> 42:46.398
You don't have to warn me
about nothing, man.

42:46.565 --> 42:48.108
I know who hit him,
why they hit him,

42:48.275 --> 42:49.652
how they hit him,
and when they hit him.

42:49.818 --> 42:51.237
They all want my business.

42:51.403 --> 42:54.323
That's all right, man.
I got a little surprise coming up.

42:55.866 --> 42:59.411
So where you stand in all this, son?

43:00.412 --> 43:03.040
You retired me, remember?

43:34.154 --> 43:37.283
Come on, let's go!
We're out of here in 10 minutes, people!

43:37.449 --> 43:39.118
10 minutes!

44:14.403 --> 44:17.072
Nice to be in business.

44:19.199 --> 44:20.659
Right.

44:22.411 --> 44:24.455
You sure all this
is going to fit in those cars?

44:24.621 --> 44:27.499
You leave that to me
and you get used to it.

44:27.666 --> 44:30.336
'Cause the day is coming
when I'm going to be the boss.

44:30.502 --> 44:32.796
Mr. Alexander?

44:32.963 --> 44:34.882
His days are numbered.

44:38.344 --> 44:40.554
Crazy gangsters.

44:45.768 --> 44:47.186
Who's that dude?

44:47.353 --> 44:49.480
- That guy there?
- Yeah.

44:49.646 --> 44:51.023
I don't know.
Never seen him before.

44:51.190 --> 44:53.108
He's not with us.

44:56.487 --> 44:59.698
Impress upon him
the value of discretion.

45:02.451 --> 45:04.745
I'm gonna go take a leak.

45:06.872 --> 45:09.875
Let's go, back it up!
Come on!

45:10.042 --> 45:12.669
Hey, don't be shitting in my toilet,
man, all right?

45:15.297 --> 45:17.800
What the fuck you doing in here,
white boy?

45:17.966 --> 45:20.177
Hmm?

45:20.344 --> 45:23.305
Don't I know you from the diner?

45:26.308 --> 45:28.560
You hear me fuckin' talking to you?

45:33.232 --> 45:35.901
That's enough, Bruce Lee.

45:38.570 --> 45:40.322
He's not the one.

45:40.489 --> 45:43.325
The one is behind you.

45:54.211 --> 45:56.130
Uh-uh.

46:00.592 --> 46:03.053
Thought you were dead.

46:04.388 --> 46:07.224
Mr. Alexander sent you up here, huh?

46:07.391 --> 46:09.601
Hid you under Constantine.

46:09.768 --> 46:14.106
Protected his favorite son
by keeping him out of sight, is that it?

46:15.190 --> 46:17.693
Look, I don't know
what the fuck happened to you,

46:17.860 --> 46:20.154
but I'm the big dog here now.

46:20.320 --> 46:23.031
And my bite is far worse
than your bite would ever be.

46:23.198 --> 46:25.534
Yeah, all that karate shit?
That shit is cool.

46:25.701 --> 46:30.247
But we 6-0, nigger.
We put one to the dome, you feel me?

46:30.414 --> 46:33.542
Now you're lucky I promised my mama
I wouldn't shoot anybody today,

46:33.709 --> 46:35.544
or your ass would be dead.

46:35.711 --> 46:38.213
That's our neighborhood.

46:38.380 --> 46:40.674
Let the bitch live.

47:28.805 --> 47:31.058
Hey, Hurst, you okay?

47:31.225 --> 47:33.227
Man, you need to lay off that shit.

47:33.393 --> 47:36.563
You want to talk,
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

48:24.528 --> 48:26.947
Fuck! Ah!

49:08.280 --> 49:10.574
Yo, dog, what's going on?

49:10.741 --> 49:12.618
What do you want to do?

49:12.784 --> 49:14.703
Bring the bitch to the club.

49:14.870 --> 49:16.204
Okay.

49:28.383 --> 49:30.218
Where you going?

49:33.513 --> 49:36.850
Grab her legs.

49:46.818 --> 49:48.528
Get the fuck up.

50:15.263 --> 50:17.474
What's going on, gentlemen?

50:18.475 --> 50:21.770
No, no, no, no, don't touch her.
What's happening?

50:21.937 --> 50:24.940
You know we've got bosses
and we've got orders.

50:25.107 --> 50:27.651
I see.
Well, you can't follow these orders

50:27.818 --> 50:30.404
because this is my house,

50:30.570 --> 50:32.656
and that's my girl.

50:32.823 --> 50:34.574
I guess it's on, then.

51:40.474 --> 51:42.559
Quit playing around.

51:50.025 --> 51:52.360
You all right?

51:53.361 --> 51:56.198
- You okay?
- Yeah.

52:10.212 --> 52:12.172
Trouble?

52:12.339 --> 52:13.381
Fuck, yeah.

52:15.926 --> 52:18.094
It's gonna get stupid around here.

52:18.261 --> 52:20.931
So you listen to me and my friends
and listen to him.

52:21.097 --> 52:24.684
- We got you. You heard?
- Yeah.

52:32.526 --> 52:35.237
You two get out of here.
I'll deal with the cops.

52:35.403 --> 52:37.072
No, ese, I can't do that.

52:37.239 --> 52:39.074
These men belong to Iceman.

52:39.241 --> 52:41.117
He's going to come after you for this.

52:41.284 --> 52:44.704
Trust me, this is the best way.

52:44.871 --> 52:46.665
This Iceman, he ain't shit.

52:46.832 --> 52:50.836
I done worse shit in an afternoon
than that puto's done in a lifetime.

52:51.002 --> 52:54.714
I'm not afraid of no AG.
And neither should you be, homes.

52:54.881 --> 52:57.175
There's more to this
than just Karen and Ice.

52:57.342 --> 53:00.220
Let me take this.
Standing my ground.

53:00.387 --> 53:03.098
Making sure I'm taking care of Karen.

53:03.265 --> 53:06.685
Two gangsters coming
after my white girl?

53:06.852 --> 53:08.353
Nah.

53:08.520 --> 53:10.230
Too bad for them.

53:11.982 --> 53:14.860
- Is this weapon clean?
- Yeah.

53:15.026 --> 53:17.153
Okay, both of you bounce.
Get out of here now.

53:17.320 --> 53:19.614
- You can't get into this.
- Are you kidding me?

53:19.781 --> 53:21.366
An old Mexican con

53:21.533 --> 53:24.411
and a former mob--
whatever you want to call it--

53:24.578 --> 53:27.080
explaining to the cops
why these two dirty gangbangers

53:27.247 --> 53:28.832
ended up all busted like they did?

53:28.999 --> 53:31.042
No way.

53:31.209 --> 53:34.004
They attacked me in my place

53:34.170 --> 53:36.673
and I used the gun that my daddy
gave me forjust such an occasion,

53:36.840 --> 53:40.260
and I don't know what happened,
but I am really glad it did.

53:40.427 --> 53:42.220
Okay?

53:46.016 --> 53:47.601
Okay?

53:48.727 --> 53:49.769
Okay.

53:55.692 --> 53:56.985
Hey, Roman?

53:57.152 --> 53:59.362
Thanks.

54:21.927 --> 54:24.554
Who is this chinga de madre?

54:24.721 --> 54:26.264
Hey, boss?

54:26.431 --> 54:29.142
Three of lceboy's men
just got whacked.

54:30.310 --> 54:31.770
Where?

54:31.937 --> 54:34.272
At the diner on 525.

54:37.359 --> 54:41.071
They're gaming us
with Mr. Alexander.

54:43.531 --> 54:47.744
Go there, get something-- anything.

54:47.911 --> 54:50.830
- You got it?
- Yeah.

54:50.997 --> 54:52.832
I'm on it.

55:04.719 --> 55:06.680
Jackie?

55:58.690 --> 56:02.360
I might have to take care of this
my own motherfuckin' self, ya hear?

56:02.527 --> 56:04.738
Yes, sir, Mr. Alexander.

56:20.253 --> 56:24.257
That crazy motherfucker thinks
he can go up against Mr. Alexander.

56:24.424 --> 56:26.593
Shit just got real.

56:26.760 --> 56:28.428
Come on.

57:24.984 --> 57:27.195
- Where Ice at?
- He knows who you are.

57:27.362 --> 57:30.406
But you just can't be walking through
this motherfucker like you own it.

57:30.573 --> 57:33.576
Why don't you ask Junior to walk up
in there and tell him I'm here?

57:33.743 --> 57:35.829
I ain't telling him shit.

57:39.457 --> 57:41.251
I think it's time for you to go.

58:01.187 --> 58:05.024
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
Yo, chill out.

58:05.191 --> 58:07.777
Ice said he'll meet with you.

58:09.487 --> 58:11.281
All right.

58:11.447 --> 58:13.616
I thought he might change his mind.

58:13.783 --> 58:16.911
I've been doing this a long time,
you know?

58:20.498 --> 58:24.210
And, uh...

58:24.377 --> 58:26.212
I'm kind of tired of all this shit.

58:26.379 --> 58:28.464
And I know what you're thinking.

58:29.465 --> 58:32.343
I don't blame you,
and I like your style.

58:32.510 --> 58:34.554
You know?

58:34.721 --> 58:37.056
But this could go two ways.

58:37.223 --> 58:40.977
One way it could go is, like, stupid,

58:41.144 --> 58:43.229
and it'll turn into a war.

58:43.396 --> 58:46.107
And war ain't no good for business.
It ain't good for nobody.

58:46.274 --> 58:48.860
To the people who run countries,
wars are great for business.

58:49.027 --> 58:51.988
But we street people, man.
We ain't gonna make no money warring.

58:52.155 --> 58:54.324
So I was thinking

58:54.490 --> 58:57.577
I'll go back up
in the mountains of Thailand

58:57.744 --> 59:00.580
where I learned
all my original bad habits,

59:00.747 --> 59:02.415
leave all this to you.

59:02.582 --> 59:04.417
But you know what?

59:04.584 --> 59:06.586
I'd like to leave with my face,
you know?

59:06.753 --> 59:10.423
So give me a little bit--
just enough to wet my beak.

59:10.590 --> 59:12.717
It's about respect. It's about face.

59:12.884 --> 59:14.302
And I'll be gone.

59:14.469 --> 59:17.931
I thought if you could come over
to the house in the next couple days,

59:18.097 --> 59:20.141
one night, and let's sit down

59:20.308 --> 59:22.936
and just have
a little business discussion.

59:23.102 --> 59:25.605
You a businessman.

59:25.772 --> 59:27.523
And I ain't talking about
business-business.

59:27.690 --> 59:29.400
I'm just talking about
leaving with respect.

59:29.567 --> 59:31.569
What do you say?

59:31.736 --> 59:35.365
Chitty chitty bang bang,
Crips and things, baby.

59:35.531 --> 59:38.201
Hmm.
We'll work out a number for you.

59:38.368 --> 59:40.161
That's what I'm talking about.

59:40.328 --> 59:42.121
Neighborhood.

59:45.708 --> 59:49.003
I'll bring my neighborhood with me,

59:49.170 --> 59:53.466
you can have this one.

59:53.633 --> 59:58.012
I like you, nigger.

59:58.179 --> 01:00:01.975
All right, fool.
I'll see you then.

01:00:10.817 --> 01:00:13.152
Get the homies strapped up.

01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:16.739
Neighborhood.

01:00:24.497 --> 01:00:28.167
You know how it is, Eric--
tactics of gun-fighting.

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:30.336
If you don't maneuver,
you will be outmaneuvered.

01:00:30.503 --> 01:00:33.298
If you're outmaneuvered,
you will be killed.

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:35.842
So let's go home,

01:00:36.009 --> 01:00:38.928
get our gear in order,

01:00:39.095 --> 01:00:41.389
and prepare for war.

01:00:41.556 --> 01:00:43.933
Do what we do best.

01:01:04.329 --> 01:01:08.875
- Hurst?
- Alexander?

01:01:09.042 --> 01:01:11.961
- I can't leave.
- Yeah, I know.

01:01:12.128 --> 01:01:14.213
But I wanted to give you
a chance, you know?

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.884
Iceman and his folks would
sort of like to have me retire early,

01:01:18.051 --> 01:01:20.511
if you know what I mean.
But you know how I am, man.

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:23.598
I'm not too partial to people
having to try to tell me what to do

01:01:23.765 --> 01:01:25.850
and when and how and where.

01:01:26.017 --> 01:01:30.104
So I was just thinking, man,

01:01:30.271 --> 01:01:34.692
I know you retired,
but I need to bring you back.

01:01:34.859 --> 01:01:37.153
No matter how all this go down,

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.405
I figured when it goes down,

01:01:39.572 --> 01:01:42.116
you could take that money
that I gave you

01:01:42.283 --> 01:01:45.411
and give some to Karen
and get her out of here.

01:01:45.578 --> 01:01:47.246
Know what I mean?

01:01:47.413 --> 01:01:50.083
I could do that.
But what about Oso?

01:01:50.249 --> 01:01:52.001
Don't worry about Oso.

01:01:52.168 --> 01:01:54.420
He's got his own
marching orders now, son.

01:01:54.587 --> 01:01:56.756
Yes, sir.

01:02:14.107 --> 01:02:16.609
Sorry, bro.

01:02:40.341 --> 01:02:44.720
Ah! What the fuck
are you doing? Oh!

01:02:44.887 --> 01:02:46.514
Relax, Roman.

01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:49.267
I'm what they call a curandero.

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:54.814
- Mexican witch doctor.
- Oh! Fuck that shit.

01:02:54.981 --> 01:02:56.441
You relax!

01:02:56.607 --> 01:02:58.192
Ahh!

01:02:58.359 --> 01:03:01.195
Look, I gotta get you all fixed up.

01:03:01.362 --> 01:03:02.905
You all badass now.

01:03:03.072 --> 01:03:06.409
You can only imagine the pain
you can inflict with two good hands.

01:03:06.576 --> 01:03:08.494
Now...

01:03:08.661 --> 01:03:13.541
this is an old family medicine.

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:15.251
It goes way back

01:03:15.418 --> 01:03:18.963
to Mayans or Incas or some shit--
I don't know. Old, though.

01:03:20.173 --> 01:03:25.178
- This is a very rare scorpion.
- Ah!

01:03:33.144 --> 01:03:35.438
One of the rarest in the world--
most poisonous too.

01:03:35.605 --> 01:03:37.190
They live right up here
in the high desert.

01:03:37.356 --> 01:03:40.401
Very few people know about them.

01:03:40.568 --> 01:03:43.029
Now these...

01:03:46.949 --> 01:03:49.702
Now this one will kill you a lot faster.

01:03:51.204 --> 01:03:53.748
Now it's very important

01:03:53.915 --> 01:03:58.503
to get the sting
right in the right area,

01:03:58.669 --> 01:03:59.795
where all the meridians are--

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:01.714
where all the meridians
are all tangled up.

01:04:17.813 --> 01:04:20.233
Can you believe that shit?
Meridians.

01:04:20.399 --> 01:04:22.068
What the hell do I know?

01:04:22.235 --> 01:04:24.445
I'm just a cook.

01:04:26.405 --> 01:04:28.908
These poisons will work together
with your body,

01:04:29.075 --> 01:04:31.202
help you find your hands again.

01:04:31.369 --> 01:04:33.704
I didn't ask for your help.

01:04:33.871 --> 01:04:36.791
Actually, Mr. Alexander did.

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:40.211
That makes us amigos.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:44.257
Now we cool?

01:04:49.095 --> 01:04:52.932
Let's do the other hand.

01:05:25.256 --> 01:05:27.425
Bitches, leave.

01:05:27.592 --> 01:05:29.302
Don't get up.

01:05:29.468 --> 01:05:31.262
Just listen.

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:37.351
Fuck you, nigger.

01:05:43.232 --> 01:05:44.734
Enough of this shit.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.611
You make a deal with the Mexicans,

01:05:46.777 --> 01:05:49.405
you moving powder
against Mr. Alexander's wishes?

01:05:49.572 --> 01:05:51.657
What do you think, Dante?

01:05:52.658 --> 01:05:55.244
I think you're a crazy nigger.

01:05:55.411 --> 01:05:57.788
You got no idea, baby.

01:05:57.955 --> 01:06:00.791
It's business, Dante.

01:06:00.958 --> 01:06:03.836
It's called consolidating power.

01:06:04.003 --> 01:06:06.922
Now I don't expect you
to understand that.

01:06:08.257 --> 01:06:12.094
But you know how much y'all be making
working for me-- you and your boys?

01:06:12.261 --> 01:06:14.096
You know how much you'll be making?

01:06:15.097 --> 01:06:18.392
Any of y'all want to make
five Gs a week?

01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:21.187
You really think you can buy me?

01:06:21.354 --> 01:06:23.397
Nigger, you already bought.

01:06:23.564 --> 01:06:27.234
Now it's either me
or the white man Mr. Alexander.

01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:30.529
What difference does it make?
You still getting paid, Tom.

01:06:31.947 --> 01:06:34.367
The difference is respect.

01:06:34.533 --> 01:06:36.702
You see, I got nothing but respect
for Mr. Alexander.

01:06:36.869 --> 01:06:38.287
You?

01:06:38.454 --> 01:06:41.499
You can go fuck your mother.

01:06:41.666 --> 01:06:43.376
6-0.

01:06:49.048 --> 01:06:53.052
Why'd you have to make that comment
about my mama?

01:06:57.098 --> 01:06:58.557
What's up with these niggers, homie?

01:06:58.724 --> 01:07:00.434
Oh, these niggers straight.
These the homies-- they with me.

01:07:00.601 --> 01:07:01.769
Okay, put 'em to work.

01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:04.480
You needs to get that nigger--
drag that nigger body outta here.

01:07:16.409 --> 01:07:17.743
What's up, nigger?

01:07:19.412 --> 01:07:22.873
I want you to call Bear Claw

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:27.211
and hit up No Name.
Be back here in two hours.

01:07:27.378 --> 01:07:29.797
- Neighbors.
- Neighbors.

01:07:46.689 --> 01:07:48.983
Good, good.

01:07:49.150 --> 01:07:51.360
Poison seems to be working.

01:07:51.527 --> 01:07:53.028
You're dying, ese.

01:07:53.195 --> 01:07:55.740
And this will fix my hands?

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:58.325
How the hell is scorpion poison
gonna fix your hands?

01:07:58.492 --> 01:07:59.702
It'll kill you, though.

01:07:59.869 --> 01:08:02.913
That's why we mixed it together--
slow down the toxins

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.791
so they'll work on your broken bones--
fix them as good as new.

01:08:05.958 --> 01:08:08.586
Wait, what broken bones?

01:08:08.753 --> 01:08:11.714
No, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait-- wait a minute.

01:08:11.881 --> 01:08:14.133
I gotta separate the bones again

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.844
so the poison helps them reset--

01:08:17.011 --> 01:08:19.764
fuse them together,
twice as strong.

01:08:19.930 --> 01:08:21.724
- Trust me.
- Okay, wait, wait.

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:25.519
So, wait-- so you've done this before.

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:29.564
- Well, I've seen it done before.
- Okay, you said--

01:08:29.732 --> 01:08:33.152
Okay, at least knock me out
with something first.

01:08:34.361 --> 01:08:37.740
I think the adrenaline from the fear

01:08:37.907 --> 01:08:39.325
has to work with the poison.

01:08:40.743 --> 01:08:42.703
I just-- I think that's how it is.

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:02.680
Finished.

01:09:09.313 --> 01:09:11.064
Somebody's coming.

01:09:12.066 --> 01:09:14.318
Close the door, close the door.

01:09:16.487 --> 01:09:20.366
Make sure it's locked.
Can't let anyone find him like this.

01:09:22.576 --> 01:09:24.745
Help me move him. Come on.

01:09:24.912 --> 01:09:26.705
Get him up!

01:09:26.872 --> 01:09:29.542
Ah! Go on!

01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:33.462
Move it!

01:09:44.849 --> 01:09:46.892
Ah!

01:09:58.445 --> 01:10:00.573
Get off of me!

01:10:05.744 --> 01:10:10.457
I know you, right?
You're Alexander's girl.

01:10:15.796 --> 01:10:18.966
That's right.
That's right, you keep on pushing.

01:10:23.512 --> 01:10:25.681
Grab this bitch.

01:10:27.099 --> 01:10:29.226
Get him in the fucking truck.

01:11:10.976 --> 01:11:13.687
Karen, right?
You're Alexander's girl.

01:11:13.854 --> 01:11:16.482
You can go to hell.

01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:23.072
Hey, boss, I found
the scrapper upstairs,

01:11:23.238 --> 01:11:25.157
but there's another one
inside the truck.

01:11:25.324 --> 01:11:27.952
Drunk-- useless if you ask me.

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:40.047
You gotta take a look
at his hands, right?

01:11:40.214 --> 01:11:41.674
But you gotta look up close.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.259
There's something weird about it.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.346
Yeah?

01:11:47.513 --> 01:11:49.431
- He's dead.
- Huh?

01:11:49.598 --> 01:11:51.767
He's dead.

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:54.478
Fuck me!

01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:59.274
- Who the fuck is he?
- He's just a drunk. He lives upstairs.

01:11:59.441 --> 01:12:01.902
Hey, look at his hands.
He's got some kind of disease.

01:12:02.069 --> 01:12:03.988
It's all full of puss.

01:12:06.824 --> 01:12:09.451
What? What are you
standing around for?

01:12:09.618 --> 01:12:12.913
Get rid of him.
Bring the fucking plague into my house.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.082
Fucking pendejos!
Take him out to the desert,

01:12:15.249 --> 01:12:18.252
plant him deep enough
the animals don't bring him back.

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:24.299
Hey, boss, what about
this one here?

01:12:24.466 --> 01:12:27.261
Por favor, chale, string her up.

01:12:27.428 --> 01:12:30.139
Yeah, my pleasure.

01:12:30.305 --> 01:12:31.557
Fuck!

01:12:31.724 --> 01:12:34.101
I'll get the answers out of her myself.

01:12:34.268 --> 01:12:35.352
Fuck it.

01:12:35.519 --> 01:12:36.729
- What?
- Where's the fucking chain?

01:12:38.355 --> 01:12:39.356
What's up, amigo?

01:12:39.523 --> 01:12:41.525
You got any new jokes for me today?

01:12:41.692 --> 01:12:43.152
You fucking psycho.

01:12:43.318 --> 01:12:44.945
You know...

01:12:45.112 --> 01:12:47.406
Manny was really attached
to his tongue.

01:12:49.241 --> 01:12:51.869
The airplane coming in.
Say "ah," motherfucker.

01:12:52.036 --> 01:12:53.537
- Say "ah!"
- Ah!

01:12:53.704 --> 01:12:55.164
Fuckin'...

01:12:58.584 --> 01:13:00.586
So I'm thinking,
maybe you and me,

01:13:00.753 --> 01:13:02.296
we finish doing business, huh?

01:13:02.463 --> 01:13:04.256
Look, man, that's a casualty of war.

01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:06.633
You know how Mr. Alexander
does business.

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:09.053
Once Alexander's gone,

01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:11.138
everything's going to be fine, baby.

01:13:11.305 --> 01:13:15.225
I'll handle distribution.
You sell everything to me. You feel me?

01:13:15.392 --> 01:13:18.020
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I think it is you

01:13:18.187 --> 01:13:19.938
who's going to have to take
my word for it.

01:13:20.105 --> 01:13:23.192
You see, I have the little puta
from the diner.

01:13:23.358 --> 01:13:25.110
You know, Alexander's girl.

01:13:25.277 --> 01:13:27.654
She's going to come in handy.

01:13:27.821 --> 01:13:29.239
Tell you what--

01:13:29.406 --> 01:13:33.619
you bring her
and bring a couple of your soldiers.

01:13:33.786 --> 01:13:35.871
I'll handle Mr. Alexander.

01:13:36.038 --> 01:13:39.750
And if you like, I'll bring you
his tongue in a yellow box.

01:13:39.917 --> 01:13:41.085
Now what do you say to that?

01:13:41.251 --> 01:13:43.128
Ooh.

01:13:43.295 --> 01:13:46.423
I say I love doing business with you.

01:13:52.638 --> 01:13:53.680
All right, gentlemen,

01:13:53.847 --> 01:13:55.307
we've got a little sand tipper
going on here.

01:13:55.474 --> 01:13:56.850
Before we start,

01:13:57.017 --> 01:13:59.686
I just want to say
nobody kill Ice but me.

01:13:59.853 --> 01:14:01.522
Everybody else free game, you hear?

01:14:01.688 --> 01:14:03.148
Heard that.

01:14:03.315 --> 01:14:04.650
All right, what I'm told
is they're going to do

01:14:04.817 --> 01:14:06.693
a dynamic entrance from the front.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:10.322
And they'll get on line here
and start shooting straight up

01:14:10.489 --> 01:14:13.492
into the compound
like a bunch of dumb-ass gangsters.

01:14:13.659 --> 01:14:15.744
I'm gonna be hiding
in this black hole here,

01:14:15.911 --> 01:14:17.329
and we'll put Josh up on the balcony

01:14:17.496 --> 01:14:18.831
and have him start throwing
some shit down.

01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:19.998
Yeah.

01:14:20.165 --> 01:14:21.583
Soon as they turn
towards him to return,

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:23.627
I'll come up here over the side
and kill him.

01:14:23.794 --> 01:14:27.256
Motherfucker, about damn time
you picked up the phone.

01:14:27.422 --> 01:14:29.133
Finally took the dick
out of your mouth or what?

01:14:29.299 --> 01:14:31.635
Hey, listen,

01:14:31.802 --> 01:14:33.679
I've got a job for you.

01:14:33.846 --> 01:14:37.182
Same shit, man.
Orale, hey.

01:14:37.349 --> 01:14:40.477
Bring something for the ho,
and I don't mean a vibrator.

01:14:40.644 --> 01:14:42.855
No, fuck you, puto.

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:46.400
Pendejo.

01:14:59.121 --> 01:15:01.999
This is a very rare scorpion.

01:15:02.166 --> 01:15:04.376
These poisons will work together
with your body,

01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:06.879
help you find your hands again.

01:15:21.268 --> 01:15:23.395
Â¢Sabes quÃ©, old man?

01:15:23.562 --> 01:15:27.232
I'm not going to even give you a chance
to tell me what's going on.

01:15:28.817 --> 01:15:31.153
Give her four.

01:15:55.594 --> 01:15:57.721
You're too late.

01:15:58.847 --> 01:16:01.475
He's gonna get you.

01:16:01.642 --> 01:16:05.896
The shadow-- he's back.

01:16:41.223 --> 01:16:43.976
One fucking shovel?
One shovel?

01:16:44.142 --> 01:16:45.727
You idiot! You know how long
it's going to take us

01:16:45.894 --> 01:16:47.229
to dig a hole with one fucking shovel?

01:16:47.396 --> 01:16:49.606
Why didn't you bring your own shovel?
You got a fucking car.

01:16:49.773 --> 01:16:51.275
Shit, homie, get him out of the trunk.

01:16:51.441 --> 01:16:53.318
Andale, grab him.

01:16:56.071 --> 01:16:57.322
Come on.

01:17:00.826 --> 01:17:03.036
Uh uh uh uh!
You brought your toothpick.

01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:06.331
I brought the chain saw.
You go get your one shovel.

01:17:06.498 --> 01:17:08.375
Pendejo.

01:17:12.337 --> 01:17:14.047
Shit. Yeah?

01:17:14.214 --> 01:17:16.508
Cesare says to be careful
with that guy you got there, all right?

01:17:16.675 --> 01:17:19.386
Why? He's fucking dead.

01:17:19.553 --> 01:17:23.181
He used to work for Mr. Alexander.
Just take care of it.

01:17:23.348 --> 01:17:25.475
Yeah, but--

01:17:27.477 --> 01:17:29.646
What the fuck you think
I'm gonna do with a chainsaw?

01:17:29.813 --> 01:17:32.024
Build a clubhouse?

01:17:32.190 --> 01:17:34.192
Come on, start digging, one shovel.

01:17:35.861 --> 01:17:37.612
Pendejo.

01:17:46.747 --> 01:17:48.540
Ah!

01:17:53.837 --> 01:17:55.088
Shit!

01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:59.337
You got three seconds
to tell me everything.

01:20:24.237 --> 01:20:27.073
Tonight's the night.

01:20:45.717 --> 01:20:48.136
Fuckin' cold out.

01:20:51.223 --> 01:20:54.392
Cesare says keep your eyes open, ese.

01:21:19.918 --> 01:21:21.920
Oso.

01:21:26.758 --> 01:21:28.760
Don't end up like me, ese.

01:21:30.679 --> 01:21:34.099
I gave you a second chance.

01:22:01.793 --> 01:22:03.503
The girl-- give her to me!

01:22:08.133 --> 01:22:09.384
Give her to me.

01:22:09.551 --> 01:22:11.928
- That may be a problem.
- Motherf--

01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:26.901
Look, I like your style.

01:22:27.068 --> 01:22:30.488
A man of action.
I think we could be friends, you know?

01:22:34.409 --> 01:22:37.704
Where's the girl?

01:22:37.871 --> 01:22:40.624
Ice has her.
They've gone to Alexander's to kill him.

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:42.792
Don't.

01:23:06.274 --> 01:23:08.568
Mr. Alexander
says wait outside the perimeter.

01:23:11.529 --> 01:23:13.281
Yo, can I help you?

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:33.760
Y'all go to the front.
Playa, you stay with me.

01:23:33.927 --> 01:23:36.846
The rest of y'all go to the back,
kill everything that moves.

01:23:37.013 --> 01:23:38.556
That's our neighborhood.

01:23:51.986 --> 01:23:53.321
Hey, homeboy.

01:24:05.125 --> 01:24:07.252
Motherfuckers huntin' up.

01:24:20.056 --> 01:24:22.100
Damn.

01:24:23.101 --> 01:24:24.853
Come on, man.

01:24:36.906 --> 01:24:38.575
Come on.

01:24:53.089 --> 01:24:55.049
Good shot.

01:24:55.216 --> 01:24:57.969
Move out, move out, move out!

01:25:00.764 --> 01:25:03.475
<i>- Rat comm' to ya.
- Gotcha.</i>

01:26:41.823 --> 01:26:44.409
This motherfucker's paranoid.

01:26:44.576 --> 01:26:47.412
He got all these damn
secret passages and shit.

01:26:47.579 --> 01:26:52.250
We 6-0.
He gonna get this work, baby.

01:27:34.959 --> 01:27:38.630
- Aw, look who's comin' to the party!
- Roman!

01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:42.467
Set the charge.

01:27:45.803 --> 01:27:47.472
Charge is set.

01:27:50.350 --> 01:27:53.561
- Rendezvous at 40, Mike Mike.
- Roger that.

01:28:04.781 --> 01:28:06.324
I'm out.

01:28:11.788 --> 01:28:13.498
Come on.

01:28:16.084 --> 01:28:18.169
Let her go!

01:28:20.713 --> 01:28:22.090
Karen?

01:28:29.222 --> 01:28:32.517
Walk away now.

01:28:32.684 --> 01:28:35.561
Or else what, motherfucker?
There's six of us!

01:28:35.728 --> 01:28:37.397
You can have this kitchen bitch.

01:28:37.563 --> 01:28:39.357
Come get her.

01:28:41.317 --> 01:28:42.610
Suit yourself.

01:29:17.145 --> 01:29:19.439
- Hurst, you got to get her!
- You okay?

01:29:19.605 --> 01:29:21.524
- I got you, nigger.
- Move, move!

01:29:32.076 --> 01:29:34.454
Should have finished me
last time we met, nigger.

01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:36.581
Now you're mine!

01:29:43.963 --> 01:29:47.133
Yeah, I been waiting on this.
Come on! Yeah.

01:29:58.853 --> 01:29:59.937
Come on!

01:30:17.371 --> 01:30:18.748
Gut him like a pig.

01:30:22.043 --> 01:30:24.670
Oh, you're out of bullets, huh?

01:30:24.837 --> 01:30:27.590
Mr. Alexander.

01:30:27.757 --> 01:30:30.134
Now we gonna see what the fuck
you really made of.

01:30:51.697 --> 01:30:54.742
Ahh!

01:31:01.624 --> 01:31:02.959
Ah!

01:31:05.628 --> 01:31:07.880
Come here, baby.

01:31:11.384 --> 01:31:13.427
Come on.

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:48.880
You about to die now, bitch!

01:32:10.026 --> 01:32:11.027
Ah!

01:32:46.145 --> 01:32:48.022
I gotta go find Karen.

01:32:48.189 --> 01:32:51.275
All right, listen,
everybody dead but Ice.

01:32:51.442 --> 01:32:53.736
I'm gonna go find him.
You find her.

01:33:20.805 --> 01:33:23.557
How the hell do I get out of here?

01:33:24.642 --> 01:33:26.978
Don't even think about it, son.

01:33:27.144 --> 01:33:29.188
How do I get out of here?

01:33:32.358 --> 01:33:34.235
How do I get out of here?

01:33:36.362 --> 01:33:38.572
I said how the hell
do I get out of here?

01:33:38.739 --> 01:33:40.366
You die.

01:33:46.247 --> 01:33:47.707
Ah!

01:34:24.243 --> 01:34:26.162
Alexander?

01:34:28.748 --> 01:34:31.751
You really retiring?

01:34:34.170 --> 01:34:35.671
Yeah.

01:34:52.855 --> 01:34:56.275
I think the streets
are clean for a while.

01:34:56.442 --> 01:35:00.154
See, I'm a dinosaur.

01:35:00.321 --> 01:35:03.574
Ain't nobody like me around
no more, so...

01:35:05.534 --> 01:35:08.662
I learned how to do bad things
to bad people,

01:35:08.829 --> 01:35:11.832
used all that to make a lot of money.

01:35:11.999 --> 01:35:16.379
But this is a bad life,
and I regret much of what I've done.

01:35:18.339 --> 01:35:19.590
