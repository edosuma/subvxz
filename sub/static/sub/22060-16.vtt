Buster!

00:21.356 --> 00:22.556
Buster!

00:24.492 --> 00:26.860
Buster!

00:37.306 --> 00:39.406
Lawrence Skolnick
is here to see you.

00:39.408 --> 00:42.042
Joy of joys.

00:42.044 --> 00:43.744
Good morning to you, too.

00:43.746 --> 00:45.479
So, we have a deal or not?

00:45.481 --> 00:46.270
We do.

00:46.294 --> 00:48.049
Well, then I take back
that sarcastic comment.

00:48.050 --> 00:49.349
With one condition.

00:49.351 --> 00:51.685
And now I'm putting that
sarcastic comment back.

00:51.687 --> 00:52.953
It's reasonable.

00:52.955 --> 00:55.322
Pleading your client down to
three years with the amount

00:55.324 --> 00:57.457
of weight he was carrying
was more than reasonable.

00:57.459 --> 00:59.259
I'm sorry. No conditions.

00:59.261 --> 01:00.294
Hear me out?

01:01.497 --> 01:03.230
My client agrees
to all of your terms,

01:03.232 --> 01:04.965
but has just one request.

01:04.967 --> 01:06.800
That the $300,000

01:06.802 --> 01:08.702
seized by the NYPD

01:08.704 --> 01:10.170
at the time of his arrest
be returned to him.

01:10.172 --> 01:12.172
What are you talking about?

01:12.174 --> 01:14.141
You got the same
police report I did.

01:14.143 --> 01:16.209
The detective vouchered
for $10,000.

01:16.211 --> 01:18.445
Perhaps I misspoke
when I said "seized."

01:18.447 --> 01:20.414
I should have said "stolen."

01:20.416 --> 01:22.616
Careful, Counselor.

01:22.618 --> 01:24.484
It's true, Erin.
Detective Fusco pocketed

01:24.486 --> 01:26.586
nearly $300,000 in cash.

01:26.588 --> 01:28.021
Says your thriceconvicted,

01:28.023 --> 01:30.957
drugdealing,
"take me at my word" client.

01:30.959 --> 01:32.959
He's telling the truth.

01:32.961 --> 01:35.195
Well, then he would be the first
career criminal to do so.

01:35.197 --> 01:39.333
I thought you might not take him
or me at our word.

01:39.335 --> 01:41.335
What is this?

01:41.337 --> 01:43.103
The results of a polygraph
that my client took,

01:43.105 --> 01:45.305
which confirm
that he is telling the truth.

01:45.307 --> 01:48.775
And what nickeldime polygraph
examiner did you get to do this?

01:49.005 --> 01:51.406
The same one your office uses.

02:01.684 --> 02:04.118
And you've been at Brooklyn
North for what, three years now?

02:04.120 --> 02:05.453
Almost four.

02:05.455 --> 02:07.021
And I'm happy to say
we've not only

02:07.023 --> 02:08.690
reduced crime by almost 11%,

02:08.692 --> 02:11.793
we did it while also
cutting civilian complaints

02:11.795 --> 02:12.994
by more than 20%.

02:12.996 --> 02:14.062
But you haven't spent any time

02:14.064 --> 02:15.363
assigned to the transit bureau.

02:15.365 --> 02:16.898
No, haven't had the pleasure.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.399
But hopefully that changes soon.

02:18.401 --> 02:20.301
You don't see
that as an impediment

02:20.303 --> 02:21.569
to heading that bureau?
More like a welcome challenge.

02:21.571 --> 02:24.539
I have not served at Transit,
but my career

02:24.541 --> 02:26.808
has taken me
to many different areas,

02:26.810 --> 02:29.544
and I'd like to think that I've
met the challenge each time.

02:29.546 --> 02:33.848
Well, you're certainly handy
with the answers, Chief Cornick.

02:33.850 --> 02:34.649
Thank you, sir.

02:34.651 --> 02:36.150
Any questions for me?

02:36.152 --> 02:37.418
No. No, not offhand.

02:37.420 --> 02:38.620
Anything to add?

02:38.622 --> 02:40.088
- No.
- No. Good.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.824
Good. Thank you, Chief.

02:42.826 --> 02:44.592
That's it?

02:44.594 --> 02:47.128
The commissioner's schedule's
already half an hour backed up.

02:47.130 --> 02:48.296
We'll be getting back
to you real soon.

02:48.298 --> 02:51.265
Commissioner?

02:53.202 --> 02:54.869
If I may say one thing?

02:55.704 --> 02:57.939
Sure.

02:57.941 --> 03:00.842
I get the feeling
I'm not your first choice.

03:00.844 --> 03:03.578
Why's that?

03:03.580 --> 03:06.481
Well, NYPD's like a small town.

03:06.483 --> 03:09.017
Word travels fast,
and that word is,

03:09.019 --> 03:12.320
Chief Penworth is your top pick.

03:12.322 --> 03:16.090
Well, it's certainly no secret
he is a candidate.

03:16.092 --> 03:17.625
Along with several others.

03:17.627 --> 03:19.894
Then please, sir,
do us all a favor.

03:19.896 --> 03:23.965
For the sake of the department,
make it one of those others.

03:25.434 --> 03:28.036
Clearly there's something else.

03:28.038 --> 03:29.971
Why don't you just say it?

03:29.973 --> 03:33.307
Chief Penworth's not
who he says he is.

03:33.309 --> 03:35.610
And I don't want to see you
or the department

03:35.612 --> 03:39.113
with egg all over its face.

03:39.115 --> 03:40.815
You know, I've said too much.

03:40.817 --> 03:43.651
Thank you for your time, sir.

03:50.694 --> 03:53.995
What does he got that we don't?

03:53.997 --> 03:55.663
I don't understand.

03:55.665 --> 03:57.065
This can't be.

03:57.067 --> 03:58.700
It's not possible.

03:58.702 --> 04:01.369
We know it's a lot to process.

04:01.371 --> 04:03.971
We're very sorry to have to come
here and give you this news.

04:03.973 --> 04:05.339
No, youyou don't understand.

04:05.341 --> 04:06.607
It can't be my husband.

04:06.609 --> 04:09.711
You must have made
some kind of mistake.

04:09.713 --> 04:10.812
He can't be dead.

04:10.814 --> 04:12.013
My husband can't be dead.

04:12.015 --> 04:13.481
Probably gonna take you
some time.

04:13.483 --> 04:14.916
No. I mean,
it's literally not possible.

04:14.918 --> 04:16.784
Jack isn't even here.
He's in London.

04:16.786 --> 04:17.851
Yeah, Mom's right.

04:17.853 --> 04:19.320
He's overseas on business.

04:19.322 --> 04:20.620
Yeah. YYou have
the wrong person.

04:20.623 --> 04:23.357
Okay, let's, back up

04:23.359 --> 04:24.459
to the beginning here.

04:24.461 --> 04:25.860
We're talking
about Jack Thompson.

04:25.862 --> 04:27.061
That's your husband's name.

04:27.063 --> 04:28.262
- Yes.
- And he lives

04:28.264 --> 04:31.766
right here
at 144 East 66th Street,

04:31.768 --> 04:34.335
Apartment 5C.
Yes, but he's not...

04:34.337 --> 04:36.304
This his wallet?

04:38.374 --> 04:40.041
My God.

04:40.043 --> 04:41.375
Is it possible that your husband

04:41.377 --> 04:42.977
came home from London early?

04:42.979 --> 04:45.713
Yeah, andand did what?

04:45.715 --> 04:47.982
Went for a walk in Central Park
before coming home?

04:47.984 --> 04:49.117
This doesn't make any sense.

04:49.119 --> 04:51.119
If he was home,
we would know it.

04:51.121 --> 04:52.353
Yeah.

04:57.159 --> 04:58.359
It's your husband's phone.

04:58.361 --> 05:00.528
No, that's not Jack's phone.

05:00.530 --> 05:04.198
We found it on his person.
Do you... know a "Lindsey"?

05:04.200 --> 05:05.700
No.

05:08.337 --> 05:10.104
Hello?

05:10.106 --> 05:11.839
Who are you?

05:11.841 --> 05:13.574
Why are you answering
Jack's phone?

05:13.576 --> 05:15.476
Do you know Jack Thompson?

05:15.478 --> 05:17.879
Do I know him? He's my fiancé.

05:17.881 --> 05:19.781
- What?
- Who the hell are you?

05:19.783 --> 05:21.048
Why are you answering his phone?

05:21.050 --> 05:24.852
Are you sure you know
who Jack Thompson is?

05:24.854 --> 05:25.953
Of course I'm sure.

05:25.955 --> 05:27.789
What the hell is going on?

05:27.791 --> 05:29.190
This Jack Thompson?

05:29.192 --> 05:30.258
Yes. That's him.

05:30.260 --> 05:31.192
What is going on?

05:31.194 --> 05:33.127
Who are you?
Who are those people

05:33.129 --> 05:34.028
with my fiancé?

05:34.030 --> 05:36.397
"Fiancé"? You mean my husband?

05:36.399 --> 05:37.665
It's okay, sit down.

05:37.667 --> 05:39.033
Please.

05:39.035 --> 05:41.068
Um, ma'am, I'm Detective Reagan

05:41.070 --> 05:42.703
with the NYPD.

05:42.705 --> 05:44.639
I'm gonna need
your address, okay?

05:55.804 --> 06:02.704
== sync, corrected by elderman ==
@elderman.

06:16.596 --> 06:17.661
Who is she?

06:17.942 --> 06:19.675
Janet Thompson.

06:19.677 --> 06:21.511
Jack Thompson's wife.

06:21.513 --> 06:23.112
For over 20 years.

06:23.114 --> 06:24.714
I had no idea.

06:26.116 --> 06:28.251
Absolutely none.

06:28.253 --> 06:29.585
He never talked
about his family?

06:29.587 --> 06:32.188
I thought we were his family.

06:32.190 --> 06:35.458
He never mentioned
any of the people

06:35.460 --> 06:36.959
in this picture to you?

06:36.961 --> 06:39.595
Never.

06:39.597 --> 06:42.632
These are really his kids?

06:42.634 --> 06:44.333
Yeah. Richard, Laura,

06:44.335 --> 06:45.334
and Trevor.

06:45.336 --> 06:47.603
How is this even possible?

06:49.239 --> 06:51.674
How long were you two
seeing each other?

06:52.976 --> 06:58.181
We started dating
about three years ago.

06:58.183 --> 07:02.852
We got pregnant with Kayla
about a year in.

07:05.123 --> 07:08.157
We were hoping
to get married this year.

07:08.159 --> 07:09.392
This is insane.

07:09.394 --> 07:11.527
This is completely insane.

07:11.529 --> 07:12.762
We understand how you feel.

07:12.764 --> 07:13.863
Believe me.

07:13.865 --> 07:15.398
So this is really Jack's baby?

07:16.667 --> 07:17.900
Apparently so.

07:17.902 --> 07:19.635
We were together
more than 20 years.

07:19.637 --> 07:21.704
How is it possible he had
another life somewhere?

07:21.706 --> 07:24.040
You mentioned he travels a lot.

07:25.042 --> 07:27.676
Yes, but what?

07:27.678 --> 07:29.110
This whole time I'm thinking

07:29.112 --> 07:31.913
he's away on business,
he's really on the other side

07:31.915 --> 07:33.582
of the park with his wife

07:33.584 --> 07:34.749
and three kids?

07:34.751 --> 07:36.284
Seems to be the case.

07:36.286 --> 07:39.688
What am I gonna tell her?

07:42.992 --> 07:45.994
How am I going to explain this
to the children?

07:45.996 --> 07:47.629
You don't know anything
about this at all?

07:47.631 --> 07:51.433
Believe me, if I did,
I'd be the reason he's dead.

07:51.435 --> 07:52.534
Are you?

07:52.536 --> 07:55.003
Absolutely not.

07:55.005 --> 07:56.805
Absolutely not.

07:56.807 --> 07:59.708
Well, did he have an ax
to grind with anyone?

07:59.710 --> 08:00.609
Any enemies?

08:00.611 --> 08:03.178
He was... the greatest.

08:03.180 --> 08:04.412
I know that sounds crazy

08:04.414 --> 08:06.214
to say now, but it's true.

08:06.216 --> 08:09.217
He was a really good guy.

08:10.419 --> 08:12.754
Loved by everyone.

08:12.756 --> 08:14.856
24 hours ago, I would've said
he's the most trustworthy person

08:14.858 --> 08:15.991
I know.

08:15.993 --> 08:18.193
So, no enemies?

08:18.195 --> 08:19.561
No.

08:19.563 --> 08:21.463
II don't know.

08:22.732 --> 08:25.100
I don't know anything anymore.

08:31.674 --> 08:34.342
Every case Detective Fusco
worked on, I want over here.

08:34.344 --> 08:36.678
Now, who has the files
on our defendant?

08:36.679 --> 08:38.013
I want that over here.

08:38.015 --> 08:40.248
I want every "I" dotted,
I want every "T" crossed.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.283
You got me?

08:41.284 --> 08:42.884
I don't want
any slipups on this.

08:42.885 --> 08:44.352
Yes, ma'am.

08:44.354 --> 08:47.322
Giving another one of your
"How to Lovingly Lead" seminars?

08:47.324 --> 08:48.356
There you are.

08:48.358 --> 08:50.091
In the flesh and the spirit.

08:50.093 --> 08:52.594
Well, good, 'cause I'm going
to need both and more.

08:52.596 --> 08:54.296
Who we going after, Jimmy Hoffa?

08:54.298 --> 08:56.331
Remember that drug dealer,
Hector,

08:56.333 --> 08:57.799
that I was letting plead down?

08:57.801 --> 09:00.936
Turns out, he coughed up an even
bigger fish for me to fry.

09:00.938 --> 09:02.304
A mako or a marlin?

09:02.306 --> 09:03.705
Killer whale.

09:03.707 --> 09:05.173
Who are we taking down?

09:05.175 --> 09:06.270
A dirty cop.

09:06.271 --> 09:06.789
Whoa.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.644
And not just any cop.

09:08.645 --> 09:10.145
A decorated detective.

09:10.147 --> 09:12.547
Okay, llet's back
up few a steps.

09:12.549 --> 09:15.183
What exactly did this scumbag
drug dealer say

09:15.185 --> 09:16.351
the detective did?

09:16.353 --> 09:18.987
Stole nearly $300,000.

09:18.989 --> 09:20.989
Now, before you start
questioning the veracity

09:20.991 --> 09:23.692
of this claim, he passed
a poly with flying colors.

09:23.694 --> 09:26.661
Okay, aand what did the
detective's file look like?

09:26.663 --> 09:28.163
I mean,
how many years on the job?

09:28.165 --> 09:29.831
Were there similar claims?

09:29.833 --> 09:33.435
Not exactly, but there are
more than a handful

09:33.437 --> 09:34.569
of civilian complaints.

09:34.571 --> 09:36.371
He's known
as a real hard charger.

09:36.373 --> 09:37.806
Check it out yourself.

09:38.641 --> 09:40.809
Mary and Joseph.

09:40.811 --> 09:41.910
What?

09:41.912 --> 09:44.112
Your whale is my old partner.

09:44.114 --> 09:45.113
Shut up.

09:45.115 --> 09:46.281
Okay.

09:46.283 --> 09:49.317
No, I don't mean to shut up,
I mean, get out.

09:49.319 --> 09:51.820
You're the boss.

09:51.822 --> 09:54.389
No... Anthony, stop taking
everything so literally.

09:54.391 --> 09:55.490
What I mean is,

09:55.492 --> 09:58.026
I can't believe that.
What are the odds?

09:58.028 --> 09:59.861
I don't know what the odds are,

09:59.863 --> 10:01.596
but I don't want no part of it.

10:04.667 --> 10:06.568
What are the chances he realizes

10:06.570 --> 10:08.803
he just said that he did
want to be a part of it?

10:08.805 --> 10:10.271
None.

10:10.273 --> 10:12.540
None.

10:14.343 --> 10:16.878
So who do you believe?
The wife or the fiancée?

10:16.880 --> 10:18.613
They're both
pretty convincing, but...

10:18.615 --> 10:20.915
But the guy was stabbed almost
ten times, which means it was...

10:20.917 --> 10:22.617
- Personal.
- Exactly.

10:22.619 --> 10:23.718
Let's divide and conquer.

10:23.720 --> 10:24.953
You canvass the building,

10:24.955 --> 10:27.856
I'll go get a warrant
for the online activity.

10:33.229 --> 10:35.497
Detective Baez.
You have a minute?

10:35.499 --> 10:38.900
Two Gs are here.

10:43.339 --> 10:44.739
Well?

10:44.741 --> 10:46.307
We searched everything.

10:46.309 --> 10:47.909
You searched everything.

10:47.911 --> 10:49.444
Dug through Chief
Penworth's file.

10:49.446 --> 10:50.945
Sat down with some
of his past COs again.

10:50.947 --> 10:52.680
Even revisited conversations

10:52.682 --> 10:54.482
with family and friends.

10:54.484 --> 10:58.286
Expanded that group, dug into
his time before the NYPD.

10:58.288 --> 10:59.421
And?

10:59.423 --> 11:00.989
Even this guy's exwife

11:00.991 --> 11:02.791
got nothing bad
to say about him.

11:02.793 --> 11:04.059
He's the real deal.

11:04.061 --> 11:05.794
Bosses love him,
rank and file respect him.

11:05.796 --> 11:07.629
So what was Cornick
trying to say?

11:07.631 --> 11:08.997
My guess, whatever it is,
he's overselling it.

11:08.999 --> 11:10.665
Chucking a Hail Mary.

11:12.501 --> 11:15.470
Okay. Baker?

11:19.375 --> 11:20.942
What's this?

11:20.944 --> 11:23.711
The Rockland Ledger.

11:23.713 --> 11:24.979
A local paper?

11:24.981 --> 11:27.348
Chief Penworth's local paper
to be exact.

11:27.350 --> 11:29.617
Dating back to 2001?

11:29.619 --> 11:31.019
That's, like, 15 years ago.

11:31.021 --> 11:32.153
Seventeen.

11:32.155 --> 11:34.222
Penworth coached
his son's baseball team

11:34.224 --> 11:35.323
to the championship,

11:35.325 --> 11:36.991
paper interviewed father
and son after the game.

11:36.993 --> 11:39.094
"What do you like
to do for fun?"

11:39.096 --> 11:40.395
The part where Penworth
compares team building

11:40.397 --> 11:44.065
to his time spent on the
front lines in the Gulf War.

11:44.067 --> 11:47.836
"An RPG hit their tank
outside Baghdad,

11:47.838 --> 11:50.872
Penworth jumped into action".

11:50.874 --> 11:52.740
But it never happened?

11:53.609 --> 11:57.479
Spent his tour behind a desk.

11:57.481 --> 12:01.015
That's not good.

12:01.017 --> 12:03.667
You got one right.

12:03.672 --> 12:05.640
They're a very nice family.
Been in the building

12:05.641 --> 12:07.207
for as long as I can remember.

12:07.209 --> 12:08.909
Mr. Thompson was a great guy.

12:08.911 --> 12:10.411
A neighbor on the floor reported

12:10.413 --> 12:11.879
hearing raised voices
through the walls.

12:11.881 --> 12:13.681
Husbands and wives argue.

12:13.683 --> 12:14.949
I'm telling you, there's no way

12:14.951 --> 12:17.151
that Mrs. Thompson had
anything to do with his murder.

12:17.153 --> 12:18.485
They argue often?

12:18.487 --> 12:20.588
I'm a doorman.
Discretion is my job.

12:20.590 --> 12:25.459
I respect that, but this is
a homicide investigation.

12:25.461 --> 12:29.029
Any information you can
give us would be helpful.

12:32.335 --> 12:33.734
Okay.

12:33.736 --> 12:35.970
So, lately, I've been getting
a lot of calls down here

12:35.972 --> 12:38.072
saying that there's been a
lot of yelling and fighting

12:38.074 --> 12:40.007
up in the apartment.

12:41.643 --> 12:42.776
Hold on, the doorman said that?

12:42.778 --> 12:44.345
Thatthat the wife
and the husband

12:44.347 --> 12:45.980
- have been fighting a lot lately?
- He said a bunch of neighbors

12:45.982 --> 12:48.048
complained this month
about yelling

12:48.050 --> 12:49.350
coming from their apartment.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.051
Detective.

12:51.053 --> 12:52.119
I'm on the phone.

12:52.121 --> 12:53.153
But, Detective, I...

12:53.155 --> 12:54.888
Yeah, not now, please.

12:54.890 --> 12:56.190
Who are you talking to?

12:56.192 --> 12:58.726
Our friendly neighborhood
TARU Tech McNightengale.

12:58.728 --> 13:00.728
- McKenna.
- What?

13:00.730 --> 13:02.863
Our friendly neighborhood
TARU Tech McKenna,

13:02.865 --> 13:04.264
not McNightengale.

13:04.266 --> 13:05.633
I don't think anybody's
named McNightengale.

13:05.635 --> 13:07.134
Okay, my bad.

13:07.136 --> 13:09.003
Sorry, I got her name wrong.

13:09.005 --> 13:10.237
It's McAnnoying.

13:10.239 --> 13:12.539
So you got the warrant.
Any hits?

13:12.541 --> 13:14.742
No, I wish I had the warrant,
but McAnnoying here

13:14.744 --> 13:16.677
is coming up donuts, isn't she?

13:16.679 --> 13:20.247
- Nothing?
- Nada. Zip, zero, zilch, nothing.

13:20.249 --> 13:21.582
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true.

13:21.584 --> 13:22.850
I mean, you got nothing
on the wife,

13:22.852 --> 13:24.451
and you've been
on the fiancée for an hour

13:24.453 --> 13:25.753
and you're putting up zeroes.

13:25.755 --> 13:27.087
Then what's this?

13:30.525 --> 13:32.059
Does that say
what I think it says?

13:32.061 --> 13:34.461
Lindsey Stewart's number one
Internet search item last week

13:34.463 --> 13:35.462
was Janet Thompson.

13:35.464 --> 13:37.231
The wife.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.166
Why didn't you tell me this?
I've been over here for an hour

13:39.168 --> 13:40.567
waiting for you to give me
some information.

13:40.569 --> 13:42.569
What? I've been trying
to tell you this for the past...

13:42.571 --> 13:45.839
Baez, the fiancée was doing
a Google search of the wife.

13:45.841 --> 13:48.242
She lied to us.
She knew about her.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.144
Meet you there. On my way.

13:50.146 --> 13:51.745
Hey.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.981
Good work, Mc... TARU.

14:05.797 --> 14:07.464
You told us before
that you had no idea

14:07.466 --> 14:10.067
that your fiancé had
another family, right?

14:10.069 --> 14:11.802
That's right.

14:11.804 --> 14:14.538
And yet the top hit on your
search engine is Janet Thompson.

14:16.274 --> 14:18.842
You want to tell us
why you lied to us?

14:18.944 --> 14:21.512
It's obvious, isn't it?

14:21.514 --> 14:23.814
I mean, Jack shows up dead.

14:23.816 --> 14:26.917
If I know about his other life,
I'm your first suspect.

14:26.919 --> 14:28.218
With good reason,
don't you think?

14:28.220 --> 14:29.920
No.

14:29.922 --> 14:33.657
No matter how bad this looks,
I did not murder Jack.

14:33.659 --> 14:35.092
When did you find out?

14:35.094 --> 14:38.228
Last week.

14:40.465 --> 14:43.901
Someone texted me a link

14:43.903 --> 14:45.335
to Janet Thompson's Facebook.

14:45.337 --> 14:46.470
Who texted you?

14:46.472 --> 14:48.806
I have no idea.
Some random number.

14:48.808 --> 14:49.940
And when you looked her up?

14:49.942 --> 14:51.475
I couldn't believe it.

14:51.477 --> 14:53.977
There was the father of my child
in all these family photos

14:53.979 --> 14:56.814
with people I'd never seen
nor heard of in my life.

14:56.816 --> 14:58.682
Must've been pretty pissed.

14:58.684 --> 15:00.417
Yeah.

15:00.419 --> 15:02.820
Sure. Of course.

15:04.189 --> 15:07.658
But mostly dazed and confused.

15:07.660 --> 15:09.326
Did you confront Jack?

15:11.162 --> 15:13.864
I didn't want to do it over the
phone while he was in London.

15:13.866 --> 15:15.466
I was gonna show him

15:15.468 --> 15:17.601
what I found, but then...

15:17.603 --> 15:19.236
But somebody killed him first.

15:20.872 --> 15:22.706
And it wasn't you.

15:22.708 --> 15:25.809
Absolutely not.

15:27.345 --> 15:30.714
You'd be willing to take
a lie detector test?

15:33.551 --> 15:35.853
Guess what. Husbands
and wives argue.

15:35.855 --> 15:37.354
Well, according
to your neighbors,

15:37.356 --> 15:39.423
you and your husband argued a
whole bunch over the past month.

15:39.425 --> 15:42.092
Well, as it turns out, he had
a whole other life and family

15:42.094 --> 15:43.393
on the other side of the park,

15:43.395 --> 15:47.231
so our marriage wasn't
exactly the gold standard.

15:47.233 --> 15:48.999
A secret life that you told us
you knew nothing about.

15:49.001 --> 15:51.268
I didn't, and
it's pretty clear now

15:51.270 --> 15:52.469
there's a reason why
our relationship's

15:52.471 --> 15:53.470
been circling the drain

15:53.472 --> 15:55.539
these last few years.

15:55.541 --> 15:57.040
Mrs. Thompson, did you
send your husband's lover

15:57.042 --> 15:58.542
a link to your Facebook account?

15:58.544 --> 16:00.811
Don't be ridiculous.

16:00.813 --> 16:02.212
Well, somebody knew about
your husband's secret life

16:02.214 --> 16:03.380
and sent your name to her.

16:03.382 --> 16:05.649
Did you want her to see
photos of your family?

16:05.651 --> 16:07.684
Absolutely not.

16:07.686 --> 16:10.387
Listen, I understand you
have a job to do here,

16:10.389 --> 16:12.256
but let's get one
thing crystal clear.

16:12.258 --> 16:14.057
I had no knowledge of
my husband's secret life

16:14.059 --> 16:16.059
and I certainly didn't
kill him for it.

16:16.061 --> 16:18.262
Not many would blame you
if you did.

16:18.264 --> 16:20.931
Nonetheless, I didn't.

16:20.933 --> 16:24.868
Would you be willing to take
a lie detector test?

16:24.870 --> 16:27.070
Excuse me?

16:37.615 --> 16:40.083
Anthony, I've been knocking
on the door forever.

16:40.085 --> 16:41.239
I know.

16:41.263 --> 16:43.263
Well, why didn't you say,
"Come in"?

16:43.289 --> 16:45.522
Because I don't want you
to come in.

16:45.524 --> 16:48.058
Anthony, I am the senior A.D.A.
in this office

16:48.060 --> 16:50.360
and you are my investigator.

16:50.362 --> 16:52.563
Not exactly something you're
bashful about, Your Highness.

16:52.565 --> 16:54.031
We need to talk.

16:54.033 --> 16:55.198
No, we do not.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.200
Anthony. Erin.

16:59.737 --> 17:01.872
I know you don't want to work
on this investigation.

17:01.874 --> 17:03.507
That's not true.

17:04.843 --> 17:06.676
Replace "don't" with "won't."

17:06.679 --> 17:08.744
Did I mention it's your job?

17:08.747 --> 17:11.147
Plenty of other detective
investigators in this building

17:11.150 --> 17:12.281
that you can use.

17:12.284 --> 17:13.684
I need you.

17:13.685 --> 17:16.587
The only way I'm gonna get close
is with someone he trusts.

17:16.589 --> 17:19.990
Well, there's a reason he trusts
me... because he can trust me.

17:19.992 --> 17:23.760
You're putting me in
a really terrible position here.

17:23.762 --> 17:25.796
I'm putting you out
when you're asking me to help

17:25.798 --> 17:27.431
take down a guy that I went
through doors with?

17:27.433 --> 17:30.033
Boy, here we go.
You don't think I get enough

17:30.035 --> 17:32.135
brothersinblue stories
at family dinner?

17:32.137 --> 17:34.471
He may have stolen hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

17:34.473 --> 17:36.540
Yeah, says a known drug dealer.

17:36.542 --> 17:37.708
Who passed a poly.

17:37.710 --> 17:39.543
Okay, Erin, whatever.

17:39.545 --> 17:41.345
Thanks for stopping by.

17:43.114 --> 17:45.749
I'm not going anywhere
until you say you're on board.

17:45.751 --> 17:49.219
Well, then I hope you brought
a toothbrush and a sleeping bag.

17:49.221 --> 17:51.955
You know, if I talk to the D.A.,
he's gonna authorize me

17:51.957 --> 17:53.256
to make you do it.

17:53.258 --> 17:56.460
Girl's got to do
what a girl's got to do.

17:56.462 --> 17:58.829
Right.

17:58.831 --> 18:01.031
Well...

18:01.033 --> 18:02.866
girl already did.

18:09.007 --> 18:11.041
Wow.

18:11.043 --> 18:13.577
Not afraid to throw inside,
are you, Erin?

18:13.579 --> 18:16.113
We start first thing
in the morning.

18:31.562 --> 18:33.764
Chief Penworth, sir.

18:39.737 --> 18:41.304
Chief.

18:41.306 --> 18:43.106
Commissioner, good to see you.

18:47.445 --> 18:49.913
So, I hear you're a grandpa now.

18:49.915 --> 18:51.882
Elizabeth Haley Penworth.

18:51.884 --> 18:53.550
I'll bet she's special.

18:53.552 --> 18:54.584
The other day she asked

18:54.586 --> 18:55.986
if we can buy her a
baby brother online.

18:55.988 --> 18:58.188
Best thing
about being a grandpa:

18:58.190 --> 19:00.090
All the fun, none of the work.

19:05.964 --> 19:09.566
The air up here
too thin for you?

19:11.769 --> 19:13.403
You okay?

19:13.405 --> 19:16.740
I think you know how much
I respect you.

19:17.842 --> 19:20.777
And you considering me
for this post has been an honor.

19:20.779 --> 19:23.513
It's also been
a humbling experience.

19:26.784 --> 19:30.287
I have to withdraw my name
from consideration.

19:34.325 --> 19:36.993
I'm sorry to hear that.

19:36.995 --> 19:38.595
No, Frank, it's me who's sorry.

19:38.597 --> 19:39.730
Jenny objects?

19:39.732 --> 19:40.931
No, nothing like that.

19:40.933 --> 19:42.666
She and the family are
completely on board.

19:42.668 --> 19:45.035
Any reasoning you care to share?

19:45.978 --> 19:51.248
I lied about my military service
in a published newspaper.

19:53.217 --> 19:57.120
A local newspaper
a couple of decades ago.

19:57.122 --> 19:59.756
You know about this?

19:59.758 --> 20:02.926
And it ain't exactly
The New York Times.

20:02.928 --> 20:05.162
And you didn't lie
about your military service,

20:05.164 --> 20:07.264
you embellished your record.

20:07.266 --> 20:09.332
Maybe nobody finds out
about this,

20:09.334 --> 20:11.535
but it will always be out there,
hanging over my head.

20:11.537 --> 20:14.571
And more importantly,
I said those things.

20:14.573 --> 20:17.274
And they were not true.

20:17.276 --> 20:19.743
Why'd you push it, Tom?

20:19.745 --> 20:22.746
Wanted to look like a big shot
in my son's eyes.

20:22.748 --> 20:25.949
Like every other dad
that ever walked the earth.

20:25.951 --> 20:27.317
Told myself it was
a harmless white lie.

20:27.319 --> 20:31.855
Which it was... until it wasn't.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.995
I'm sorry it has to end
this way.

20:45.303 --> 20:46.737
So, who do you like for it?

20:46.739 --> 20:48.672
Well, Lindsey knowing
about the other marriage

20:48.674 --> 20:49.766
makes her look
real good for this.

20:49.768 --> 20:52.803
True, but, you know, she
was married to this guy

20:52.805 --> 20:54.671
for 20 years, he's got another
family right across town.

20:54.673 --> 20:57.774
Something tells me her
instincts would pick up on it.

20:57.776 --> 20:59.309
Yeah. Women's intuition.

20:59.311 --> 21:02.612
Or a wife's nosiness.

21:02.614 --> 21:04.214
Here he comes.

21:04.216 --> 21:05.216
It's not her.

21:08.586 --> 21:10.253
Well, then,

21:10.255 --> 21:11.221
it's got to be...

21:11.223 --> 21:12.189
It's not her.

21:12.191 --> 21:13.290
She's telling the truth.

21:13.292 --> 21:15.025
Come on.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.328
You got to be kidding me.

21:42.832 --> 21:43.898
We got nothing.

21:43.900 --> 21:44.933
Not nothing.

21:44.935 --> 21:45.967
Next to nothing.

21:45.969 --> 21:47.335
No, we got something.

21:47.337 --> 21:50.371
Look, we figure out who sent
the text to Lindsey about Janet,

21:50.373 --> 21:51.506
we got something.

21:51.508 --> 21:52.974
The text came
from a burner phone.

21:52.976 --> 21:54.442
- Dead end.
- Not a dead end.

21:54.444 --> 21:57.078
I was able to figure out where
the burner phone was purchased.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.313
East side or west side?

21:58.315 --> 21:59.781
Neither.

21:59.783 --> 22:01.816
It was purchased at a bodega
in Washington Heights.

22:01.818 --> 22:02.951
With a credit card?

22:02.953 --> 22:04.185
Cash.

22:04.187 --> 22:05.687
Well, how are we gonna
nail down our buyer?

22:05.689 --> 22:08.623
Well, that's why I brought
the popcorn, you see?

22:09.492 --> 22:10.859
What is all that?

22:10.861 --> 22:13.428
These are surveillance videos

22:13.430 --> 22:15.497
from the bodega
in Washington Heights.

22:15.499 --> 22:16.664
We got to watch it all?

22:18.501 --> 22:20.201
Want me to get
some Milk Duds, too?

22:25.108 --> 22:27.142
Top of the morning,
my Irish rose.

22:27.144 --> 22:29.711
Anthony. It's nice to see you.

22:29.713 --> 22:31.246
Good to be seen.

22:31.248 --> 22:32.680
So, we're good?

22:32.682 --> 22:34.249
All good.

22:34.251 --> 22:37.352
I thought about
what you said last night,

22:37.354 --> 22:38.787
and it started to sink in.

22:38.789 --> 22:39.454
Truth is,

22:39.456 --> 22:40.989
you're right.

22:40.991 --> 22:43.458
Working this case is my job.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.994
Well, I can't tell you
how happy I am to hear that.

22:45.996 --> 22:48.463
So here you go.

22:48.465 --> 22:50.131
What's this?

22:50.133 --> 22:52.700
A letter to the D.A.

22:52.702 --> 22:55.403
You're resigning?

22:55.405 --> 22:57.138
You want to throw me chin music,

22:57.140 --> 22:59.407
you better believe
I'm gonna charge the mound.

22:59.409 --> 23:01.009
Anthony, this is crazy.

23:01.011 --> 23:02.210
Look, I like this job plenty.

23:02.212 --> 23:04.279
I even like working with you
most of the time,

23:04.281 --> 23:05.914
but there's no way
I'm wearing a wire

23:05.916 --> 23:07.182
on my partner.

23:07.184 --> 23:09.884
Even if he stole hundreds
of thousands of dollars?

23:09.886 --> 23:11.553
He didn't. You don't know that.

23:11.555 --> 23:13.588
- I know him.
- You don't.

23:13.590 --> 23:15.123
Nobody knows anybody, Anthony.

23:15.125 --> 23:17.358
It's the one thing we all come
to learn in this business.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.693
He's a standup guy, Erin.

23:18.695 --> 23:21.095
Well, he wouldn't be the first
standup guy to fall down.

23:21.097 --> 23:25.099
Look, I'll give you this, Erin,
you know better than most,

23:25.101 --> 23:27.635
because of this job
and who your family is,

23:27.637 --> 23:29.637
but you still have never worn
the uniform.

23:29.639 --> 23:32.774
Come on, Anthony, I was
swaddled in the NYPD blues.

23:32.776 --> 23:35.009
Yeah, but you never summoned up
the courage to go through a door

23:35.011 --> 23:37.212
into a known hell
because you trusted

23:37.214 --> 23:40.915
that another human being
had your six.

23:41.717 --> 23:44.018
He save your life?

23:44.020 --> 23:46.888
We saved each other's lives.

23:46.890 --> 23:49.390
Multiple times.

23:49.392 --> 23:51.292
Break a leg.

23:59.735 --> 24:01.402
My brain's turning to oatmeal.

24:01.404 --> 24:03.805
Turning?

24:06.675 --> 24:09.711
I can't watch another hour

24:09.713 --> 24:12.614
of mindnumbing 40ounce
bodega purchases.

24:12.616 --> 24:14.048
Take a walk.

24:14.050 --> 24:16.451
Are you seeing something
that means something?

24:16.453 --> 24:17.919
You think I've got
the greatest hits tapes?

24:17.921 --> 24:20.154
I'm watching
the same paint dry as you.

24:20.156 --> 24:22.123
And you didn't get anything
when you called that number?

24:22.125 --> 24:22.991
What number?

24:22.993 --> 24:23.958
The number that came up

24:23.960 --> 24:25.360
on the text that Lindsey got.

24:25.362 --> 24:27.161
It's from a burner phone.
It's probably at the bottom

24:27.163 --> 24:28.329
of the Gowanus right now.

24:28.331 --> 24:29.697
You never called it?

24:29.699 --> 24:31.266
Did you?

24:31.268 --> 24:32.867
Wha...

24:32.869 --> 24:34.235
Do you have the number?

24:34.237 --> 24:36.671
Wow, you will do
anything to avoid

24:36.673 --> 24:37.839
actually working, won't you?

24:37.841 --> 24:39.841
The number.

24:43.312 --> 24:44.379
Straight to voice mail?

24:44.381 --> 24:46.314
No, it's ringing, smartypants.

24:46.316 --> 24:47.815
From the bottom of the river?

24:47.817 --> 24:49.284
- Hello?
- It's a woman.

24:49.286 --> 24:52.253
Hi, ma'am, um, I was calling
to let you know

24:52.255 --> 24:56.858
that you are the lucky winner
of two tickets to see Hamilton,

24:56.860 --> 24:58.259
on Broadway.

24:58.261 --> 25:00.194
All I need is your name
and address,

25:00.196 --> 25:02.830
and, um, we'll send
the tickets right over.

25:04.700 --> 25:06.401
Hello?

25:06.403 --> 25:07.869
Hello?

25:07.871 --> 25:09.003
- Hung up?
- Yeah.

25:09.005 --> 25:11.940
Hung up. But the voice,
I recognized it.

25:11.942 --> 25:13.441
Shut up.

25:13.443 --> 25:15.310
Janet Thompson.

25:15.312 --> 25:17.578
The wife.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.817
I'll make you a deal.

25:22.819 --> 25:23.952
What kind of a deal?

25:23.954 --> 25:26.020
Sit down with him.

25:26.022 --> 25:28.723
I told you, I'm not wearing
a wire on my partner.

25:28.725 --> 25:30.992
No wire, just sit with him.

25:30.994 --> 25:33.628
- And do what?
- And talk to him.

25:33.630 --> 25:35.663
- Just talk to him?
- Just talk to him.

25:35.665 --> 25:37.231
And if, by the end
of that conversation,

25:37.233 --> 25:40.668
you still think he's innocent,
then I will drop everything.

25:40.670 --> 25:41.803
You will?

25:41.805 --> 25:44.005
I will.
You have my word, Anthony.

25:50.946 --> 25:52.513
And whatever you decide to do,

25:52.515 --> 25:54.716
we'll make it work.

25:54.718 --> 25:56.918
Thank you, Garrett.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.553
Chief Cornick
is in the building.

25:58.555 --> 25:59.821
Abigail's bringing him up.

26:02.057 --> 26:03.591
He's a good choice, boss.

26:03.593 --> 26:04.892
I mean, he might not be

26:04.894 --> 26:06.461
your first choice,
but he's still

26:06.463 --> 26:07.562
a topshelf pick, you know?

26:07.564 --> 26:08.730
Transit will be lucky
to have him.

26:08.732 --> 26:11.099
Okay, Sid.

26:13.837 --> 26:15.269
Chief Cornick's here.

26:18.407 --> 26:19.640
Chief, take a seat.

26:19.642 --> 26:20.608
Please.

26:20.610 --> 26:21.709
Thank you for having me,
Commissioner.

26:21.711 --> 26:23.978
Sure.

26:23.980 --> 26:26.447
Craig's son is on the job,
did you know that?

26:26.449 --> 26:27.515
Out in the 64.

26:27.517 --> 26:29.317
I didn't know that.

26:29.319 --> 26:30.752
I used to work in the 64.

26:30.754 --> 26:33.554
It is an honor to be here again,
Commissioner.

26:33.556 --> 26:37.225
And, listen, I, I want to thank
you for sharing your concerns

26:37.227 --> 26:39.327
about Chief Penworth.

26:39.329 --> 26:40.528
No, not at all.

26:40.530 --> 26:43.898
I felt it was my duty
to protect the department.

26:45.401 --> 26:49.504
But you didn't really share
your concerns, did you?

26:49.506 --> 26:51.205
Sir?

26:51.207 --> 26:52.774
Instead, you just lit
a smoke bomb

26:52.776 --> 26:55.376
and hightailed it
out of the room.

26:55.378 --> 26:58.946
I'm not sure I follow.

26:58.948 --> 27:01.649
You used to ride with Penworth.

27:01.651 --> 27:05.186
That makes you one of,
I don't know,

27:05.188 --> 27:07.588
maybe five guys
who knew about this.

27:07.590 --> 27:11.592
And you were willing to use it
to get this job.

27:11.594 --> 27:13.694
AAll due respect, Commissioner,

27:13.696 --> 27:17.265
I... I hardly think
this is appropriate thanks

27:17.267 --> 27:20.468
for saving your department from
another black eye in the press.

27:20.470 --> 27:22.170
What Penworth did was wrong.

27:22.172 --> 27:25.473
What you did was worse, Chief.

27:25.475 --> 27:27.809
I blew the whistle
on a lie, sir.

27:27.811 --> 27:31.312
I mean, cops blow whistles,
they always have.

27:31.314 --> 27:33.481
Thanks for stopping by.

27:49.866 --> 27:54.268
Well... kind of threw
Penworth under the bus.

27:54.270 --> 27:56.871
Kind of?

27:56.873 --> 28:01.042
No way anyone's gonna dig up
a little article

28:01.044 --> 28:03.845
from a local paper
from a hundred years ago.

28:03.847 --> 28:08.449
And that's really not
the point, is it?

28:08.451 --> 28:11.552
No.

28:13.455 --> 28:16.057
Now what do we do?

28:18.962 --> 28:21.162
Find an honest man.

28:29.905 --> 28:31.239
You think she recognized
your voice?

28:31.241 --> 28:33.908
If she did, she's halfway
to JFK by now.

28:33.910 --> 28:35.910
Why would she hold
onto a burner phone?

28:35.912 --> 28:38.946
Or why would she be crazy enough
to answer a burner phone?

28:39.915 --> 28:40.748
RMPs in place?

28:40.750 --> 28:41.883
Yeah, they're watching the back.

28:41.885 --> 28:43.251
Okay, here we go.

28:44.586 --> 28:45.786
Mrs. Thompson!

28:45.788 --> 28:47.822
Police. Open up.

28:47.824 --> 28:49.357
Come in, it's open.

29:02.571 --> 29:04.172
Mrs. Thompson?

29:16.285 --> 29:18.486
I killed my husband.

29:35.253 --> 29:37.183
Well, I can't say
it makes me happy,

29:37.184 --> 29:39.184
but Mrs. Thompson
is in the system.

29:39.186 --> 29:40.251
Good.

29:40.253 --> 29:41.553
I'm fried.

29:41.555 --> 29:43.098
You okay if I go lay down?

29:44.100 --> 29:45.366
You okay?

29:45.368 --> 29:46.767
Yeah, I'm just fried, too.

29:46.769 --> 29:47.835
But go ahead.

29:47.837 --> 29:49.236
I'll keep working.

29:49.238 --> 29:50.671
I'll be in the dorm.

29:50.673 --> 29:52.373
All right.

29:59.614 --> 30:02.149
Good to see you, man.

30:20.669 --> 30:21.835
Well?

30:21.837 --> 30:24.171
He says he didn't have
nothing to do with it.

30:25.273 --> 30:26.974
Hey, we had a deal, Erin.

30:35.016 --> 30:37.484
Baez. Come on,
you got to get up.

30:37.486 --> 30:38.552
Reagan?

30:38.554 --> 30:39.787
What are you doing here?

30:39.789 --> 30:40.888
How did you get
into my apartment?

30:40.890 --> 30:42.156
We're not in your apartment.

30:42.158 --> 30:43.657
Open your eyes. Come on.

30:43.659 --> 30:44.892
You took a nap
in the squad, remember?

30:44.894 --> 30:47.995
Please tell me
this is a horrible dream.

30:47.997 --> 30:51.365
Unfortunately, it just might be.

30:51.367 --> 30:52.833
What are you talking about?

30:52.835 --> 30:55.603
We never bothered
to ask who was arguing.

30:55.605 --> 30:57.538
- What?
- The doorman.

30:57.540 --> 30:58.939
Do you remember?

30:58.941 --> 31:01.442
Neighbors complained
about raised voices.

31:01.444 --> 31:03.143
Right.

31:03.145 --> 31:05.079
We never bothered to ask
if anyone ever identified

31:05.081 --> 31:08.115
exactly who the raised voices
belonged to.

31:08.117 --> 31:10.551
Reagan, maybe I'm
still half asleep,

31:10.553 --> 31:12.453
but I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:12.455 --> 31:15.589
I mean, obviously, it was
Mr. and Mrs. Thompson.

31:15.591 --> 31:17.024
Yeah, Mr. and Mrs. Thompson.

31:17.026 --> 31:18.325
That's exactly what I thought.

31:18.327 --> 31:21.395
Yeah, because it's the only
one that makes any sense.

31:21.397 --> 31:22.997
Or maybe you and I
weren't willing

31:22.999 --> 31:25.132
to consider
the only alternative.

31:25.134 --> 31:27.635
I have no idea
what you're saying,

31:27.637 --> 31:30.404
but I know I don't like
the way you're saying it.

31:30.406 --> 31:34.675
You know, sometimes I wish
I'd joined the fire department.

31:34.677 --> 31:38.012
Firemen always get
to be the good guy.

31:38.014 --> 31:39.380
Come on.

31:39.382 --> 31:40.881
What is going on?

31:40.883 --> 31:42.883
I'll show you. Come on.

31:45.820 --> 31:46.920
While you were napping,

31:46.922 --> 31:49.123
I watched the rest
of the surveillance tapes.

31:49.125 --> 31:50.224
You watched all those?

31:50.226 --> 31:52.860
Yeah, and look what I found.

31:52.862 --> 31:54.528
Am I supposed to
know who that is?

31:54.530 --> 31:56.063
You're still sleeping.

31:56.065 --> 31:57.598
Keep watching.

31:57.600 --> 32:00.301
Look.

32:02.837 --> 32:06.006
It's Trevor Thompson,
Janet's son.

32:06.008 --> 32:07.808
He sent the text message
to Lindsey.

32:07.810 --> 32:09.176
Now you're waking up.

32:09.178 --> 32:10.177
Well, let's go get him.

32:10.179 --> 32:11.979
No need.

32:11.981 --> 32:13.480
Already done.

32:16.918 --> 32:18.919
Shall we?

32:18.921 --> 32:20.554
Why didn't you throw
away the burner phone

32:20.556 --> 32:21.655
when you were done with it?

32:21.657 --> 32:23.357
I don't know.

32:23.359 --> 32:24.725
I didn't know
what to do with it,

32:24.727 --> 32:26.393
so II just hid it
in my bottom drawer.

32:26.395 --> 32:28.629
And your mom was in the
apartment when I called it?

32:28.631 --> 32:30.164
She heard it ringing,

32:30.166 --> 32:32.032
so she went to my bedroom
and found it.

32:32.034 --> 32:35.069
But it was you who sent the text
to your father's fiancée.

32:36.838 --> 32:38.906
You wanted her to
know who your mother was,

32:38.908 --> 32:42.242
wanted her to know your
father had a family.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.816
How'd you find out about
your father's other life?

32:50.151 --> 32:51.618
It's okay, Trevor.
You can tell us.

32:54.589 --> 32:57.458
I was running late
for school one day,

32:57.460 --> 32:59.893
so I cut through the park.

33:00.995 --> 33:03.030
And I saw him

33:03.032 --> 33:05.132
come out of some building

33:05.134 --> 33:07.601
with this woman and a baby.

33:07.603 --> 33:09.303
You couldn't tell your mother?

33:09.305 --> 33:10.571
It would kill her.

33:10.573 --> 33:11.638
So you told the other woman.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.474
And nothing happened.

33:13.476 --> 33:15.976
That's when you decided
to confront your dad?

33:15.978 --> 33:18.112
Somebody had to tell him
to knock it off.

33:18.114 --> 33:20.447
But when you confronted him,
things got heated.

33:21.816 --> 33:23.117
You had a knife on you?

33:23.119 --> 33:26.653
III only meant...
I only meant to scare him.

33:26.655 --> 33:29.957
But it wasn't your mom who
killed your dad, was it?

33:32.293 --> 33:35.229
It wasn't her.

33:52.714 --> 33:54.081
Good morning.

33:54.083 --> 33:55.315
What the hell?!

33:55.317 --> 33:57.785
God, you almost gave me
a heart attack.

33:57.787 --> 34:00.421
I got to talk to you about
something important.

34:00.423 --> 34:03.223
Okay. Well, do you have to sit
in my office in the dark

34:03.225 --> 34:05.526
like some creeper?

34:05.528 --> 34:09.763
We used to play a lot of poker
in the squad.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.100
And we pretty much had
a regular game going,

34:13.101 --> 34:14.201
and, to be honest,

34:14.203 --> 34:16.870
I pretty much used
to run the table.

34:16.871 --> 34:18.071
Well, I'm really happy for you.

34:18.072 --> 34:19.973
I can see why you had
to scare the hell out of me

34:19.975 --> 34:22.141
to give me that
critical information.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.143
Especially when my partner,
Jimmy, was with us at the table.

34:24.146 --> 34:27.047
I used to take him
to the cleaners.

34:27.049 --> 34:28.649
You want to know why?

34:28.650 --> 34:30.451
Because you're really good
at playing cards?

34:30.453 --> 34:32.152
I'm average.

34:32.154 --> 34:34.688
Well, above average to be
completely honest with you.

34:34.690 --> 34:36.123
That's wonderful.
Are we anywhere near

34:36.125 --> 34:39.460
this riveting tale
coming to a conclusion?

34:39.462 --> 34:42.728
See, Jimmy Fusco had a tell.

34:42.731 --> 34:44.630
Whenever he was bluffing,

34:44.632 --> 34:46.333
he used to rub his chin.

34:46.335 --> 34:47.601
That's how I used to own him.

34:47.603 --> 34:50.370
Well, that certainly
was worth the suspense.

34:50.371 --> 34:51.438
Thank you so much for sharing.

34:51.440 --> 34:53.907
Don't you get
what I'm telling you?

34:53.909 --> 34:55.641
No, I don't.

34:55.643 --> 34:57.578
Last night when I asked Jimmy
if he had anything to do

34:57.580 --> 34:59.046
with this money going missing...

34:59.048 --> 35:01.882
He rubbed his chin.

35:01.884 --> 35:04.618
He did it, Erin.

35:04.620 --> 35:07.154
He did it.

35:07.156 --> 35:09.923
Anthony, I'm sorry.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.795
Where does that leave us?

35:14.797 --> 35:16.864
I mean, what do we do?

35:16.866 --> 35:18.866
We ain't gonna do nothing.

35:21.769 --> 35:23.704
You do realize you just said

35:23.706 --> 35:24.972
that we are gonna do something.

35:24.974 --> 35:27.274
Yeah, I do.

35:27.276 --> 35:29.276
You do?

35:29.278 --> 35:32.846
Let's go get
this son of a bitch.

35:38.586 --> 35:40.287
She confessed to killing
her twotiming husband,

35:40.289 --> 35:41.889
so I arrested her.
But it was his son.

35:41.891 --> 35:45.726
Yes, but I was quick to take
her confession at face value,

35:45.728 --> 35:47.294
which is my first failure.

35:47.296 --> 35:48.428
What was your second?

35:48.430 --> 35:49.930
I arrested the son.

35:49.932 --> 35:53.166
For doing what, in the old days,
would've been considered

35:53.168 --> 35:54.668
defending his mother's honor.

35:54.670 --> 35:55.936
But it's not the old days.

35:55.938 --> 35:57.437
So it's not a fail.

35:57.439 --> 36:01.308
Okay, so maybe I didn't fail,
but I kind of wish I did fail.

36:01.310 --> 36:02.276
Does that count?

36:02.278 --> 36:04.311
- Not sure.
- Not a fail?

36:04.313 --> 36:06.380
- No.
- Okay, so I only failed once.

36:06.382 --> 36:09.249
Nothing worse than when
the good guy's the bad guy.

36:09.251 --> 36:12.152
Yeah, when the bad guy
keeps on destroying lives

36:12.154 --> 36:13.854
even after he's gone.

36:13.856 --> 36:14.955
Okay, whose turn? Who didn't go?

36:14.957 --> 36:16.723
Jack.

36:16.725 --> 36:18.825
- Pass.
- Come on, Jack. You can't do that.

36:18.827 --> 36:20.794
- Can't pass.
- I did not miss this game at all.

36:20.796 --> 36:22.462
There's no getting out of it,
Jack. Come on.

36:22.464 --> 36:23.597
What did you fail at this week?

36:23.599 --> 36:25.132
Can't we just be
like a normal family

36:25.134 --> 36:28.101
and you guys ask us
about school or something?

36:28.103 --> 36:30.237
Or talk about the good things
that happened this week?

36:30.239 --> 36:31.471
It's tradition.

36:31.473 --> 36:33.240
Because there's almost nothing
to learn from success.

36:33.242 --> 36:34.274
Failure, on the other hand,

36:34.276 --> 36:35.576
is the best teacher
you'll ever have.

36:35.578 --> 36:38.111
- And we will take your word for it.
- Not happening.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.880
Guys, believe me, I get it.

36:39.882 --> 36:41.448
I used to think it was nuts,
too, but you'll see.

36:41.450 --> 36:43.483
- It's really useful.
- How?

36:43.485 --> 36:45.285
Because if you aren't failing,
you aren't trying,

36:45.287 --> 36:48.655
and if you aren't trying, you aren't
really living. Exactly right.

36:48.657 --> 36:50.325
Come on, Jack, spit it out.
What'd you screw up this week?

36:50.349 --> 36:51.225
Yeah, what was it?

36:51.226 --> 36:52.759
- Come on.
- Come on, son.

36:52.761 --> 36:55.395
Embrace the pain.

36:56.698 --> 36:58.332
All right, fine.

36:58.334 --> 37:01.535
I asked Stacey Librizzi
on a date and she said no.

37:02.538 --> 37:04.538
Ooh.

37:04.540 --> 37:06.306
Harsh. Shut up.

37:06.308 --> 37:07.407
Congratulations.

37:07.409 --> 37:09.276
Way to go, Jack. Why?

37:09.278 --> 37:11.244
Say it with me. "Stacey
Librizzi, keep walking"".

37:11.246 --> 37:13.046
Hey, Stace, your loss.

37:13.048 --> 37:15.082
Or "Please, Don't Go, Girl".

37:15.084 --> 37:16.683
- Yeah!
- What does that even mean?

37:16.685 --> 37:18.318
It's an oldie, but goodie.
Forget about it.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.453
We've all been there.

37:19.455 --> 37:20.721
Welcome to the brotherhood.

37:20.723 --> 37:22.122
You guys are all so weird.

37:22.124 --> 37:23.590
What'd you learn from it?

37:23.592 --> 37:24.992
I don't know.

37:24.994 --> 37:26.927
Jack.

37:26.929 --> 37:29.229
How about you took your shot,
you got shot down,

37:29.231 --> 37:30.797
but you're still standing.

37:32.066 --> 37:33.634
I'll go with that.

37:35.503 --> 37:36.903
All right,
who else hasn't gone yet?

37:46.614 --> 37:47.948
What?

37:47.950 --> 37:49.349
What about you, Francis?

37:49.351 --> 37:51.284
Any failures this week?

37:53.121 --> 37:56.189
Too soon to tell.

38:06.901 --> 38:10.070
Most of the criteria that has
to be met for consideration

38:10.072 --> 38:13.874
to a post like chief of transit
is obvious:

38:13.876 --> 38:16.276
Skill and experience,

38:16.278 --> 38:18.045
scalability of talent,

38:18.047 --> 38:20.313
integrity, honesty,

38:20.315 --> 38:23.550
and the ability
to get along with me.

38:25.054 --> 38:27.821
My choice has served this city
in 19 years of service

38:27.823 --> 38:29.790
with this department,

38:29.792 --> 38:33.827
including highly successful
postings in the Patrol,

38:33.829 --> 38:35.696
Special Operations,

38:35.698 --> 38:38.331
Transportation
and Housing Bureaus.

38:38.333 --> 38:40.467
He is wellliked and respected,

38:40.469 --> 38:42.602
not just by all of us
in this building,

38:42.604 --> 38:46.173
but by the rank and file
across this city.

38:46.175 --> 38:50.210
But if there is one trait
that I would consider

38:50.212 --> 38:53.647
first among equals
in picking a chief,

38:53.649 --> 38:56.616
it is accountability.

38:56.618 --> 38:59.352
You can't ask the men and women
in your command for it

38:59.354 --> 39:03.890
if you don't first and foremost
own it yourself.

39:03.892 --> 39:08.195
There is one of our finest
who meets all these criteria,

39:08.197 --> 39:10.931
first to last...

39:10.933 --> 39:14.468
our new transit chief,
Thomas Penworth.

39:25.546 --> 39:27.714
Congratulations, Chief.
