00:57.625 --> 01:01.708
I do want to say that we
try to do the story legally.

01:02.708 --> 01:03.958
Shit.

01:05.125 --> 01:08.417
I thought of all the possibilities
of what could happen,

01:08.500 --> 01:10.833
and it kept me up at night.

01:18.417 --> 01:21.167
The story that Ric
showed me at the beginning

01:21.250 --> 01:23.500
was just the tip of the iceberg.

02:35.667 --> 02:39.542
TAIJI, JAPAN

02:40.125 --> 02:42.833
Here it is-- the town of Taiji.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.833
The little town
with a really big secret.

02:49.458 --> 02:51.583
It's funny driving into Taiji.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.833
It's kind of like The Twilight Zone.

02:53.917 --> 02:55.667
It's so bizarre

02:55.750 --> 02:58.000
because if you didn't know
what's going on over here,

02:58.042 --> 03:01.708
you would think this is a town
that loved dolphins and whales.

03:01.792 --> 03:07.000
On our left here is the infamous
Taiji Whale Museum.

03:07.083 --> 03:09.625
And I really, really
hate this place.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.958
When we first got to Japan,

03:13.042 --> 03:15.042
Ric O'Barry was incredibly frustrated.

03:15.125 --> 03:16.917
He said, "Oh, you have
to wear a mask.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.458
Otherwise, they'll know
that we're here."

03:18.542 --> 03:20.458
And I thought, okay, all right.

03:20.542 --> 03:22.000
There's the police.

03:22.042 --> 03:24.667
I've got to hunch over
and change my shape

03:24.708 --> 03:27.208
so they think
I'm just some old Japanese guy.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.667
I thought, you know, what am I doing?

03:30.708 --> 03:33.333
I went halfway across the world
to end up in this car,

03:33.375 --> 03:35.125
locked up with this paranoid guy.

03:35.208 --> 03:36.292
Somebody's behind me.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.583
I don't know who that is.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.417
Yep. He's coming. He's coming.

03:40.500 --> 03:41.500
Is he really?

03:41.583 --> 03:43.917
Yeah. I've been doing this too long.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.083
The mayor of this town
actually gave me the key to the city.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.667
I was welcome then.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.042
Today they'd kill me if they could.

03:51.125 --> 03:52.667
And I'm not exaggerating.

03:52.708 --> 03:55.208
If these fishermen could
catch me and kill me,

03:55.250 --> 03:56.792
they would.

03:58.083 --> 03:59.750
About three years ago,

03:59.833 --> 04:02.083
my friend Jim Clark and l
started this organization--

04:02.167 --> 04:05.458
The Oceanic Preservation Society, OPS.

04:05.542 --> 04:08.458
We've been diving for over 35 years,

04:08.542 --> 04:11.542
and you could go back to the same
dive spot year after year

04:11.625 --> 04:13.208
and literally see
the degradation of the oceans

04:13.292 --> 04:15.000
before your very eyes.

04:15.083 --> 04:18.166
LOUIE PSIHOYOS
Co-founder, Oceanic Preservation Society
There's major extinctions
going on right now in our lifetime.

04:19.708 --> 04:20.958
Jim had the idea

04:21.041 --> 04:23.667
to try to do something
about it, to stop this,

04:23.708 --> 04:26.458
so I began documenting
reefs around the world.

04:26.542 --> 04:29.792
I went to a marine mammal conference
down in San Diego.

04:30.333 --> 04:33.667
There was 2,000 of the world's
top marine mammal scientists,

04:33.708 --> 04:37.167
and Ric O'Barry was supposed
to be the keynote speaker,

04:37.208 --> 04:38.542
and at the last minute,

04:38.625 --> 04:41.750
the sponsor of the program
pulled him from the ticket.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.292
I thought, oh God, that's interesting.

04:43.375 --> 04:44.542
Well, who's the sponsor?

04:44.625 --> 04:46.708
They said, "Sea World."

05:01.042 --> 05:03.458
A lot of marine mammal
scientists get their money

05:03.542 --> 05:06.125
from Hub Research Institute,

05:05.167 --> 05:07.917
RIC O'BARRY
Earth Island Institute

05:06.208 --> 05:09.500
which is the nonprofit arm of Sea World.

05:11.083 --> 05:13.292
They don't like me.

05:13.375 --> 05:16.333
They don't like my message
about captivity,

05:16.375 --> 05:18.000
and they took me off the list.

05:18.042 --> 05:22.125
They wouldn't let me
talk about this dolphin slaughter in Taiji.

05:22.208 --> 05:24.500
I said, "Dolphin slaughter?
What's-- What's that about?"

05:24.542 --> 05:27.042
He says, "Well, I'm going next week.

05:27.125 --> 05:28.250
You want to come?"

05:31.458 --> 05:35.792
Now we're approaching the area
that's most important.

05:37.667 --> 05:40.000
That's a dolphin's
worst nightmare right there.

05:41.625 --> 05:44.792
Hundreds of thousands
of dolphins have died there.

05:44.875 --> 05:48.708
You'll see the signs--
"Keep Out", "Danger."

05:48.792 --> 05:52.458
There are fishermen walking
around these hills with knives.

05:52.542 --> 05:54.917
This is a national park.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.375
The fishermen told me.

05:56.458 --> 06:00.083
They said, "If the world finds out
what goes on here,

06:00.167 --> 06:02.083
we'll be shut down."

06:02.167 --> 06:03.583
Can you imagine that?

06:03.667 --> 06:05.417
They actually told us that.

06:05.500 --> 06:09.000
We knew to get in there
and film exactly what happens.

06:09.042 --> 06:10.833
We need to know the truth.

06:12.083 --> 06:16.500
HOTEL URASHIMA
Katsuura, Japan

06:13.917 --> 06:15.750
When we got back to the hotel--

06:15.833 --> 06:17.625
It's a big spa hotel,

06:17.708 --> 06:19.917
people going by in robes,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.917
and there's these three
undercover cops talking to Ric.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.708
Did you come to Japan...

06:27.875 --> 06:29.583
against...

06:30.208 --> 06:32.667
catching whale and dolphin?

06:32.375 --> 06:33.375
No.

06:33.458 --> 06:36.458
Anti whale fishing and dolphin fishing...

06:36.583 --> 06:37.167
No.

06:37.167 --> 06:39.042
activity?

06:39.042 --> 06:40.000
- No.
- No?

06:40.083 --> 06:40.750
No.

06:41.125 --> 06:41.958
He's just saying no.

06:41.833 --> 06:42.958
In the background,

06:43.042 --> 06:46.250
you could see these dolphin boats
going by in the window,

06:46.333 --> 06:48.167
and it was just-- it was so surreal.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.167
I couldn't-- I wanted to laugh,

06:50.208 --> 06:52.083
and I wanted to scream
at the same time.

06:52.125 --> 06:53.292
I hope...

06:53.708 --> 06:57.792
you don't enter the place prohibited.

06:58.375 --> 07:00.000
No. No.

07:01.167 --> 07:02.167
Right. I know.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.167
You absolutely don't enter.

07:04.208 --> 07:04.708
Yeah.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.500
I don't enter. No, no.

07:07.542 --> 07:09.042
Thank you so much, and--

07:09.083 --> 07:10.083
You're welcome.

07:10.167 --> 07:12.042
- See you again.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

07:12.083 --> 07:15.333
I never planned
on being an activist.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.125
One thing leads to another,

07:17.208 --> 07:20.292
and now if there's
a dolphin in trouble

07:20.375 --> 07:22.125
anywhere in the world,

07:22.208 --> 07:23.417
my phone will ring.

07:25.667 --> 07:30.000
Ric is world famous
for his work with dolphins.

07:30.042 --> 07:33.792
The first time I connected
with him in recent years

07:30.750 --> 07:35.500
HARDY JONES
Founder, BlueVoice.org

07:33.875 --> 07:35.958
was on a trip down to Nicaragua.

07:37.042 --> 07:38.375
There were two dolphins

07:38.417 --> 07:40.708
in a swimming pool filled
with their own excrement.

07:40.792 --> 07:45.208
Ric somehow enlisted
the military forces of Nicaragua.

07:45.292 --> 07:47.833
The dolphins were
put on a helicopter,

07:47.917 --> 07:49.542
and then out to sea we go,

07:49.625 --> 07:51.167
and the dolphins are released.

07:53.208 --> 07:55.917
We're going to capture these dolphins
out of the wild

07:56.000 --> 07:57.375
and bring them into captivity.

07:57.417 --> 08:00.500
There are people
who will set them free.

08:02.375 --> 08:04.000
In March of this year,

08:04.083 --> 08:06.708
O'Barry was arrested
three times in Florida

08:06.792 --> 08:09.500
for trying to free some captive dolphins.

08:09.583 --> 08:12.208
On Earth Day, he was
arrested for the same thing

08:12.292 --> 08:14.417
on the lsland of Bimini.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.250
How many times
have you been arrested?

08:16.333 --> 08:18.583
This year?

08:19.833 --> 08:23.500
NAVY TEST SITE
Key West National Wildlife Refuge
Swimmer, you're within
a government-authorized test area.

08:23.583 --> 08:25.667
You are holding up
a government project.

08:25.708 --> 08:27.583
Do you understand?

08:27.667 --> 08:29.333
God damn it.

08:31.667 --> 08:35.292
A dolphin in the right spot
can make a million dollars a year.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.417
There's a lot of money in it.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.750
If you get in their way--

08:38.832 --> 08:40.125
and I get in their way--

08:40.207 --> 08:42.542
it can be very, very dangerous.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.042
Jane Tipson, she was murdered.

08:46.125 --> 08:49.542
She's the second colleague
I've worked with that was murdered.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.125
The other one was Jenny May.

08:51.208 --> 08:55.417
We were trying to stop
the traffic in Russian dolphins,

08:55.500 --> 08:57.208
and it involved a hunger strike.

08:57.292 --> 08:59.708
About the tenth day, I passed out,

08:59.750 --> 09:01.333
and I went to a hospital there,

09:01.375 --> 09:02.708
so Jenny became a target,

09:02.750 --> 09:04.542
and they followed her
down the beach

09:04.583 --> 09:06.750
and strangled her with her own belt.

09:08.583 --> 09:11.958
These dolphins are symbolic
of a new day for the environment.

09:12.042 --> 09:15.000
It's all about respect now,
not exploitation.

09:18.375 --> 09:20.250
I feel somewhat responsible

09:20.333 --> 09:22.750
because it was the Flipper TV series

09:22.833 --> 09:26.458
that created this
multi-billion-dollar industry.

09:26.542 --> 09:30.875
It created this desire
to swim with them and kiss them

09:30.958 --> 09:33.583
and hold them and hug them
and love them to death,

09:33.667 --> 09:35.792
and it created all these captures.

09:49.375 --> 09:51.250
There were five female dolphins

09:51.333 --> 09:53.542
who collectively played
the part of Flipper.

09:53.625 --> 09:55.917
I captured the five dolphins myself.

09:56.125 --> 10:01.167
RIC O'BARRY in 1962

09:57.833 --> 10:01.292
The entire crew turns to
with battle station teamwork.

10:01.375 --> 10:02.917
When the porpoise is sighted,

10:03.000 --> 10:05.042
not a moment can be lost.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.542
The men handle this creature
with infinite care.

10:07.583 --> 10:11.542
She seems to sense
that she has come home,

10:11.583 --> 10:14.292
that no harm will come to her now.

10:14.375 --> 10:16.417
She is safe.

10:17.458 --> 10:21.750
When Flipper Premiered in 1964,
Ric O'Barry became the most famous
dolphin trainer in the world

10:24.958 --> 10:28.458
When I started training dolphins,
there was no manual.

10:28.542 --> 10:29.792
I would get the script,

10:29.875 --> 10:33.375
and it says "Flipper goes over
to the dock "and picks up the gun

10:33.458 --> 10:35.542
and then swims down left to right."

10:35.625 --> 10:38.208
I had to actually translate that
into action somehow.

10:38.292 --> 10:39.500
Thanks, Flipper.

10:40.917 --> 10:42.875
RIC O'BARRY
Yeah. Thanks, Flipper.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.875
The thing that really struck me

10:46.958 --> 10:49.583
was that they're smarter
than we think they are.

10:51.917 --> 10:54.250
The house that you see
on the Flipper set

10:54.333 --> 10:55.458
where the family lives

10:55.542 --> 10:56.750
was actually my house.

10:56.833 --> 10:59.958
I lived there all year round
for seven years.

11:00.042 --> 11:01.542
And right in front of the house

11:01.625 --> 11:03.750
there was a lake, salt water lake,

11:03.833 --> 11:06.833
and that's where Flipper was
at the end of the dock.

11:06.917 --> 11:10.750
When Flipper came on television
at Friday night at 7 :30,

11:10.833 --> 11:12.917
I would take my television
set from the house

11:13.000 --> 11:14.333
and go down the end of the dock

11:14.375 --> 11:15.875
with a long extension cord,

11:15.958 --> 11:19.417
and Cathy would watch
herself on television,

11:19.500 --> 11:23.083
and she could tell the difference
between herself and Suzy,

11:23.167 --> 11:25.583
who was another Flipper
dolphin that was used.

11:27.042 --> 11:30.167
I knew then they were self-aware,

11:30.250 --> 11:34.542
and when you become conscious
of this nonhuman intelligence,

11:34.625 --> 11:37.875
you realize after a while
they don't really belong in captivity.

11:37.917 --> 11:40.917
But I didn't do anything about it.

11:42.458 --> 11:45.333
One day, it all ended.

11:45.375 --> 11:49.042
Like the props, they went
back to the Miami Seaquarium.

11:56.667 --> 12:00.167
When you just walk into this place
and the music is playing,

12:00.250 --> 12:02.625
the dolphin is jumping and smiling,

12:02.708 --> 12:05.292
it's hard to see the problem.

12:05.375 --> 12:10.375
But a dolphin's smile
is nature's greatest deception.

12:10.458 --> 12:14.417
It creates the illusion
they're always happy.

12:28.625 --> 12:32.417
The nerve center of any dolphinarium
is the fish house.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.083
And if you go to any one
of these fish houses,

12:35.167 --> 12:38.583
you'll see bottles
of Maalox and Tagamet.

12:38.667 --> 12:41.542
And they're used
because dolphins get ulcers,

12:41.625 --> 12:43.708
because they're all stressed out.

12:45.583 --> 12:47.792
You have to see them in the wild

12:47.875 --> 12:50.583
to understand
why captivity doesn't work.

13:05.542 --> 13:09.917
In the wild, they're traveling
40 miles a day.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.333
They could be surfing
in one area in the morning,

13:13.375 --> 13:16.792
and the next hour
they could be 25 miles away

13:16.875 --> 13:19.708
feeding or socializing.

13:20.875 --> 13:25.042
Dolphins are acoustic creatures.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.917
That's their primary sense.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.833
The best sonar that man has

13:31.917 --> 13:34.500
is a toy compared
to the dolphins' sonar.

13:34.583 --> 13:35.833
When you're in the water,

13:35.875 --> 13:37.583
the dolphins can see
right through you.

13:37.667 --> 13:40.125
They can see your heart beating.

13:40.208 --> 13:41.583
They can see your bones.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.000
They can see if you're pregnant.

13:44.375 --> 13:48.958
They get a lot of information
with their sound.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.375
The dolphin is captured
and put in a concrete tank

13:52.417 --> 13:56.667
surrounded by a stadium
full of screaming people.

13:59.958 --> 14:02.833
At the National Aquarium in Baltimore,

14:02.875 --> 14:05.625
when it first opened,
dolphins were dying left and right.

14:05.708 --> 14:07.000
They couldn't keep dolphins alive,

14:07.042 --> 14:08.417
and they finally figured out

14:08.500 --> 14:13.417
it's because the filtration system
was making a lot of noise.

14:14.833 --> 14:17.375
It's the stress that kills them.

14:18.875 --> 14:21.208
So they're very sensitive to sound.

14:21.292 --> 14:23.292
That's their primary sense,

14:23.375 --> 14:27.042
and that's their downfall in Taiji.

14:28.292 --> 14:30.875
TAIJI

14:33.208 --> 14:35.292
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7--

14:35.375 --> 14:36.583
There's 12 of them.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.792
This is a classic drive,

14:38.875 --> 14:40.458
what you're watching here.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.083
There are migratory routes

14:43.167 --> 14:46.000
that dolphins have been using
for thousands of years,

14:46.042 --> 14:48.875
and they just wait
till the dolphins come by.

14:48.917 --> 14:51.792
The boats then put these
long poles in the water

14:51.875 --> 14:54.917
which have a flange on the bottom,

14:55.000 --> 14:58.500
and they just bang on these poles
with hammers,

14:58.583 --> 15:03.875
and they create a wall of sound
which frightens the dolphins.

15:06.083 --> 15:09.375
There were several hundred dolphins
being driven ashore.

15:09.417 --> 15:11.875
I'd never seen so many
dolphins before,

15:11.958 --> 15:14.583
and they were all
running for their lives,

15:14.667 --> 15:16.458
running from this wall of sound.

15:18.583 --> 15:22.042
I think I can actually
hear the banging,

15:22.083 --> 15:23.542
but I hear it all the time.

15:23.625 --> 15:25.167
I hear it in my sleep.

15:25.250 --> 15:28.083
That sound never goes away
once you hear it.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.333
By the time they get to the lagoon,

15:31.417 --> 15:34.708
they're totally freaked out,
stressed out to the max.

15:34.792 --> 15:37.167
They seal it, then they go home.

15:38.625 --> 15:39.875
The next morning,

15:39.917 --> 15:42.583
all of these dolphin trainers
will be lined up

15:42.667 --> 15:47.292
selecting the ones that they want
for the dolphinariums.

16:02.500 --> 16:05.125
They're looking for bottlenose
dolphin, primarily.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.708
They're looking for Flipper,

16:06.792 --> 16:09.500
and so they collect young females,

16:09.583 --> 16:11.750
just like we did for the Flipper show.

16:13.250 --> 16:17.042
And they're flown to different
parts of the world.

16:22.292 --> 16:29.083
Taiji is the largest supplier of dolphins
to marine parks and swim with dolphin programs
around the world.

16:30.333 --> 16:37.167
Each dolphin sells for up to $150,000.
The Taiji Whale Museum brokers the deals,
with the town and fishermen sharing the profits.

16:38.750 --> 16:42.250
I could have my own dolphin facility
somewhere in the Caribbean

16:42.333 --> 16:43.875
and be making 2 or 3
million dollars a year

16:43.958 --> 16:46.625
Iike these guys, if I wanted to.

16:46.708 --> 16:48.833
But I walked away from that.

16:50.417 --> 16:52.750
The thing that turned me around

16:52.833 --> 16:55.917
was the death of Flipper, of Cathy.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.958
She was really depressed.
I could feel it.

17:01.042 --> 17:03.125
I could see it.

17:03.208 --> 17:06.541
And she committed suicide in my arms.

17:06.583 --> 17:10.000
That's a very strong word, suicide.

17:10.083 --> 17:11.541
But you have to understand

17:11.583 --> 17:16.166
dolphins and other whales
are not automatic air breathers,

17:16.250 --> 17:17.625
Iike we are.

17:17.708 --> 17:21.250
Every breath they take
is a conscious effort.

17:21.333 --> 17:23.541
And so they can end their life

17:23.625 --> 17:26.958
whenever life becomes too unbearable

17:27.041 --> 17:29.458
by not taking the next breath.

17:29.542 --> 17:32.500
And it's in that context
I use the word suicide.

17:32.583 --> 17:34.125
She did that.

17:34.208 --> 17:35.958
She swam into my arms

17:36.042 --> 17:37.500
and looked me right in the eye

17:37.583 --> 17:39.583
and...took a breath--

17:40.875 --> 17:42.000
and didn't take another one.

17:43.208 --> 17:44.583
I just let her go,

17:44.667 --> 17:49.083
and she sank straight down on her belly
to the bottom of the tank.

17:51.750 --> 17:55.125
The next day, I was in the Bimini jail

17:55.208 --> 17:59.167
for trying to free a dolphin
at the Lerner Marine Laboratory.

17:59.250 --> 18:02.125
That's how I reacted to it.

18:02.208 --> 18:05.750
I was going to free
every captive dolphin I could.

18:07.917 --> 18:10.208
I spent ten years
building that industry up.

18:10.250 --> 18:16.125
And I spent the last 35 years
trying to tear it down.

18:18.917 --> 18:22.167
When I started out,
there were only three dolphinariums.

18:24.417 --> 18:27.958
Today it's become
a multi-billion-dollar industry.

18:29.750 --> 18:32.375
In all of these captures,

18:32.458 --> 18:37.417
we helped create the largest slaughter
of dolphins on the planet.

18:41.750 --> 18:45.750
Anyone can watch the capture process
go on from the road.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.250
But Ric pointed out

18:47.333 --> 18:49.333
where they take the boats
around to the secret cove

18:49.417 --> 18:54.000
that nobody could see
where dolphins that weren't selected

18:54.083 --> 18:57.833
are slaughtered and sold for their meat.

18:57.833 --> 19:02.708
The dolphin drives begin in
September and go through March.

19:04.292 --> 19:09.000
An estimated 23,000 dolphins and porpoises
are killed in Japan each year.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.875
Here in Taiji,

19:11.917 --> 19:15.583
you can go to the Whale Museum
and watch the dolphin show

19:15.667 --> 19:17.708
and eat a dolphin at the same time.

19:17.792 --> 19:21.833
They sell dolphin and whale meat
right in the dolphinarium.

19:27.333 --> 19:32.375
It's the captivity industry
that keeps this slaughter going

19:32.417 --> 19:36.292
by rewarding the fishermen
for their bad behavior.

19:36.375 --> 19:39.542
They only get $600 for a dead dolphin,

19:39.583 --> 19:44.875
but they can get more than $150,000
for a live show dolphin.

19:47.208 --> 19:50.625
I told Ric
that I'd help him out,

19:50.708 --> 19:53.042
that we'll fix this, we'll change this.

19:54.625 --> 19:56.208
And I didn't tell him how

19:56.250 --> 19:59.375
because I really didn't know
how we were going to do it.

19:59.458 --> 20:03.083
There are lots of groups
here in Japan--

20:03.167 --> 20:05.583
World Wildlife Fund, Greenpeace,

20:05.667 --> 20:08.000
International Fund
for Animal Welfare.

20:08.083 --> 20:11.500
They all make hundreds
of millions of dollars between them.

20:11.583 --> 20:14.042
This is the largest slaughter
of dolphins in the world.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.333
Where are they?

20:17.917 --> 20:19.417
There is one organization

20:19.500 --> 20:23.000
whose sole purpose is to protect
all cetaceans in the wild.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.208
That's the IWC--

20:24.292 --> 20:25.792
the International Whaling Commission.
INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION
Annual Meeting

20:25.875 --> 20:27.042
But for some reason,
INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION
Annual Meeting

20:27.125 --> 20:30.875
small cetaceans, dolphins
and porpoises, aren't protected.

20:30.958 --> 20:33.875
Dolphins are whales.

20:33.917 --> 20:36.208
Size doesn't matter.

20:36.250 --> 20:40.083
The IWC will go down in history
as a ship of fools.

20:40.167 --> 20:42.083
There's no--
There's no democracy here

20:40.208 --> 20:44.000
RIC at IWC 2006
St. Kitts, West Indies

20:42.125 --> 20:44.250
by any stretch of the imagination.

20:44.333 --> 20:46.458
They do whatever the hell
they want to do.

20:47.500 --> 20:52.875
Ric has been banned permanently
from attending the IWC.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.125
Mr. O'Barry, you know I'm here.

20:52.208 --> 20:53.250
Yeah?

20:53.333 --> 20:55.875
I have to ask you to leave the hotel.

20:55.917 --> 20:57.458
You could have waited
till morning, but--

20:57.542 --> 21:00.458
Sir, I asked you very nicely
to turn off your camera.

21:00.542 --> 21:04.833
The reason why small cetaceans
are not popular with the IWC

21:03.125 --> 21:07.125
MICHAEL ILLIFF
Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studies
University of Tasmania

21:04.917 --> 21:07.542
is because the whaling nations
that set this thing up

21:07.583 --> 21:10.208
clearly has the best interest
in leaving those out,

21:10.250 --> 21:12.458
particularly if they
happen to be eating them.

21:13.750 --> 21:17.625
JOJI MORISHITA
IWC Delegate for Japan

21:14.250 --> 21:18.208
Joji Marshita is the Deputy
Commissioner for Whaling.

21:18.292 --> 21:22.625
He's a talented guy from Japan
with a real hard job to do.

21:19.417 --> 21:22.208
IAN CAMPBELL
Former Australian Cabinet Minister

21:22.708 --> 21:24.208
He has to get up every day.

21:24.292 --> 21:26.042
First he'll look at himself in the mirror,

21:26.083 --> 21:27.583
and then he's got to go out

21:27.625 --> 21:31.750
and explain to the world
Japan's whaling policy.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.292
Very complicated subject to get around.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.917
It's clear the issue of whaling

21:37.000 --> 21:39.208
is becoming more of emotions.

21:39.250 --> 21:42.875
We have never
had a convincing reason

21:42.917 --> 21:44.958
why this species is so special.

21:45.042 --> 21:46.833
They use underwater sound to herd

21:47.208 --> 21:50.042
FINLAND
the dolphins to a site where they are killed.

21:50.042 --> 21:55.000
They asked Japan to clarify whether this was
an accurate description of the hunt.

21:55.667 --> 21:59.542
Japan responded that this was an
issue of small cetaceans,

21:59.708 --> 22:04.333
of which it believes IWC
does not have competency.

22:04.583 --> 22:05.833
The International
Whaling Commission

22:05.917 --> 22:08.125
is the only international body
dealing with whales

22:06.417 --> 22:10.500
CAPTAIN PAUL WATSON
President, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society
Co-Founder, Greenpeace

22:08.208 --> 22:10.875
that's officially recognized
by the United Nations.

22:10.958 --> 22:13.750
It's basically
a toothless organization,

22:13.833 --> 22:16.125
but it is the only
organization that does exist.

22:19.333 --> 22:27.875
The IWC banned commercial whaling in 1986.
One year later, Japan responded by tripling its
kills of dolphins and porpoises and starting
lethal research programs on large whales.

22:25.875 --> 22:26.958
Well, there's a clause

22:27.042 --> 22:28.875
in the International
Whaling Convention

22:28.917 --> 22:32.625
that allows a nation
to take whales for science,

22:32.708 --> 22:36.583
and Japan has decided
that that's its loophole.

22:36.625 --> 22:39.083
Currently, Japan
has research programs

22:39.167 --> 22:41.292
that involve killing minke whales,

22:40.292 --> 22:42.917
DOUG DEMASTER, PH.D.
U.S. Deputy Commissioner for the IWC

22:41.375 --> 22:44.542
fin whales, sei whales,
and humpback whales.

22:44.625 --> 22:47.208
Every scientific catch, to me,

22:47.292 --> 22:50.250
is a dark spot on the record
of this commission.

22:47.750 --> 22:49.875
MONACO

22:50.333 --> 22:55.125
They're talking about
the 1,000 whales in the Antarctic.

22:55.208 --> 22:56.583
They're not talking about

22:56.667 --> 22:59.333
the 23,000 over here
being slaughtered.

22:59.417 --> 23:00.875
The IWC has presided

23:00.917 --> 23:02.458
over one of the greatest

23:02.542 --> 23:04.125
environmental
catastrophes of all time.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.875
The reality is the International
Whaling Commission

23:06.958 --> 23:08.792
does have a mandate

23:08.875 --> 23:11.458
to look at issues
affecting dolphins,

23:11.542 --> 23:14.875
but the Japanese are
trying to legitimize a practice

23:14.917 --> 23:17.708
that just about every country
in the world has said no to.

23:17.750 --> 23:19.750
Governments are really great

23:19.792 --> 23:21.458
at getting together
and holding meetings

23:21.542 --> 23:23.125
and conferences
and glad-handing each other,

23:23.208 --> 23:25.375
but they never ever seem
to accomplish anything.

23:25.417 --> 23:27.542
It's as Margaret Mead once said--

23:27.625 --> 23:30.125
never ever depend
upon governments or institutions

23:30.208 --> 23:31.708
to solve any major problem.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.417
All social change comes
from the passion of individuals.

23:34.500 --> 23:38.750
If saving cetacean
species from extinction

23:38.833 --> 23:40.875
relies upon the International
Whaling Commission,

23:40.917 --> 23:43.000
then there is no hope.

23:50.583 --> 23:51.917
During the Greek era,

23:51.958 --> 23:55.250
it was punishable by death
to harm a dolphin.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.417
They were protected,

23:56.500 --> 23:58.083
and they were protected

23:58.167 --> 24:00.625
because there's a lot
of stories throughout history

24:00.708 --> 24:03.375
of dolphins saving the lives of humans.

24:06.417 --> 24:11.292
There's some real magic there
when you're on a wave together.

24:11.375 --> 24:13.083
There's this other species

24:12.167 --> 24:15.125
DAVE RASTOVICH
Co-Founder, Surfers for Cetaceans

24:13.167 --> 24:15.583
that you can't consciously
communicate with,

24:15.625 --> 24:17.833
and you're both experiencing a thing

24:17.917 --> 24:19.500
that's purely for joy

24:19.583 --> 24:22.417
beyond the level of survival.

24:22.458 --> 24:25.542
I went surfing
on the east coast of Australia.

24:25.625 --> 24:27.333
About half an hour
into the session,

24:27.417 --> 24:29.167
I was sitting
with this friend of mine,

24:29.250 --> 24:30.583
and he goes, "Wait,"

24:30.667 --> 24:34.125
and on the surface of the next wave
was a tiger shark.

24:34.208 --> 24:38.542
Its fins were down,
and it was in the zone.

24:38.583 --> 24:41.208
This thing was literally
2 meters away from me,

24:41.250 --> 24:43.750
and I look down, and right there--

24:43.833 --> 24:45.875
it's like in a glass case in a wall--

24:45.917 --> 24:47.875
this dolphin comes out of right field

24:47.917 --> 24:49.333
and T-bones this shark

24:49.417 --> 24:51.833
and pushes it directly
away from me and my buddy.

24:54.167 --> 24:55.250
In that moment--

24:55.333 --> 24:59.542
That's the most obvious demonstration
of the connection in my life.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.833
A few years ago,
a friend of mine told me

25:03.917 --> 25:07.000
about what was going on in Japan.

25:07.083 --> 25:10.708
23, 000 are being
wiped out every year,

25:10.750 --> 25:13.500
and it's not even acknowledged.

25:14.708 --> 25:18.083
Nobody has actually seen
what takes place back there,

25:18.167 --> 25:21.042
and so the way to stop it
is to expose it.

25:21.083 --> 25:22.917
They've already told us that--

25:23.000 --> 25:24.375
"Don't take pictures."

25:24.417 --> 25:26.292
The sign says "Don't take pictures."

25:26.375 --> 25:30.542
And so the way to stop it
is keep exposing this to the world.

25:30.625 --> 25:32.833
Eventually,
the Japanese government will say

25:32.917 --> 25:35.292
"Look, this is not working.
It's a PR nightmare."

25:35.375 --> 25:36.875
No! No photograph.

25:38.583 --> 25:41.125
I brought the BBC,
The London Times,

25:41.208 --> 25:42.667
Time Magazine,

25:42.750 --> 25:44.542
and everybody
goes away empty-handed.

25:46.125 --> 25:47.542
No photos, okay?

25:51.750 --> 25:53.625
They're afraid of cameras.

25:53.708 --> 25:55.917
One morning I didn't
have my camera,

25:56.000 --> 25:57.542
and a couple guys from the boat,

25:57.583 --> 26:00.042
they took a baby dolphin up
and cut its throat.

26:00.083 --> 26:03.208
It was already dead,
but they held it up and cut its throat,

26:03.250 --> 26:04.833
and they were just
trying to get me angry,

26:05.250 --> 26:06.083
and I almost hit this guy.

26:06.583 --> 26:07.958
He got right in my face.

26:08.042 --> 26:09.542
We called him Private Space.

26:09.625 --> 26:12.292
That's the only two words
he knows in English--

26:12.375 --> 26:13.667
private space.

26:13.750 --> 26:14.708
Private!

26:14.792 --> 26:16.292
And he got right in my face,

26:16.375 --> 26:17.875
and he's screaming
at me with a camera.

26:17.917 --> 26:19.250
He wanted me to hit him.

26:19.292 --> 26:20.833
I mean, he just egged me on,

26:20.917 --> 26:22.917
and I almost-- man,
I almost decked this guy

26:23.000 --> 26:24.833
and knocked him off that rock.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.417
That's what they want you to do--

26:26.500 --> 26:29.542
hit them or do something
to get you out of here.

26:29.625 --> 26:31.375
The only way they can
get us out of here

26:31.458 --> 26:33.625
is get us arrested and get it on video.

26:33.708 --> 26:35.708
I spend most of my time

26:35.750 --> 26:40.708
trying to keep from getting arrested
on bogus charges.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.125
They spend most of their time

26:42.208 --> 26:44.458
trying to arrest us
on bogus charges

26:44.542 --> 26:46.500
and get us out of the game.

26:46.375 --> 26:49.333
TAIJI, 2003

26:48.583 --> 26:52.458
In 2003, I sent a crew to Taiji.

26:52.542 --> 26:54.833
Their objective was to
just get evidence to film

26:54.917 --> 26:56.875
and see what's going on there.

26:56.958 --> 26:58.917
They got into the water
and cut the nets

26:59.000 --> 27:01.083
and released some
pilot whales and dolphins

27:01.167 --> 27:03.458
and were immediately
arrested for that.

27:03.542 --> 27:05.167
Come on!

27:05.250 --> 27:06.542
That actually worked out

27:06.583 --> 27:07.917
to show that we were determined

27:07.958 --> 27:09.500
to protect the lives
of these animals,

27:09.583 --> 27:11.917
but of course it made it
very difficult to return.

27:12.042 --> 27:14.833
TAIJI, 2007

27:15.625 --> 27:18.125
I n 2007, when I wanted
to do something

27:18.208 --> 27:19.958
to expose the issue,

27:20.042 --> 27:21.208
I was shocked

27:21.250 --> 27:23.458
that I was the only surfer
in my surfing community

27:23.542 --> 27:24.875
that knew about this,

27:24.917 --> 27:27.542
so Hayden Panettiere, lsabel Lucas,

27:27.625 --> 27:29.458
we all connected,
and we made the decision,

27:29.542 --> 27:31.125
okay, we're going to paddle out.

27:31.208 --> 27:32.875
No one's
going to be aggressive.

27:32.958 --> 27:36.292
And they got really fired up.

27:38.208 --> 27:39.542
We had to pull the pin.

27:39.583 --> 27:40.917
There was nothing we could do,

27:40.958 --> 27:43.083
nothing more we could do
in that scenario.

27:44.958 --> 27:45.792
Go away!

27:46.708 --> 27:47.625
You are bothering us!

27:48.292 --> 27:49.458
Go away!

27:51.375 --> 27:54.125
You see, this is like
a cat and mouse game.

27:54.208 --> 27:55.375
Those particular activists,

27:55.417 --> 27:58.333
they were arrested right here
in this very spot.

27:58.417 --> 27:59.958
Now they can never come back.

28:00.042 --> 28:01.500
They're out of the game.

28:03.375 --> 28:05.667
My heart went out to them.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.958
I watched Flipper as a child.

28:08.042 --> 28:09.917
I grew to love the oceans
partly because of Flipper.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.708
We are going to stop this.

28:11.792 --> 28:13.708
We're going to stop this.

28:13.750 --> 28:16.250
And here's the guy that started it all.

28:16.333 --> 28:18.583
He's trying to rectify
this huge problem,

28:18.625 --> 28:20.625
but he can't find
anybody to help him.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.750
If we could just get in there,
we can stop this.

28:27.750 --> 28:32.958
Charles Hambleton
ANTIGUA, WEST INDIES

28:28.292 --> 28:31.208
The first guy I called was
my buddy Charles Hambleton.

28:31.250 --> 28:33.375
He's a adrenaline junkie.

28:33.458 --> 28:35.542
He's been sail master on
The Pirates of the Caribbean.

28:35.583 --> 28:38.167
He's traveled all over the world
on photo assignments.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.083
He's the guy that has a heart of gold

28:39.458 --> 28:43.833
TAIPEI 101
World's Tallest Building

28:40.125 --> 28:42.125
and nerves of steel.
He'll do anything.

28:45.083 --> 28:48.208
I remember distinctly a phone call

28:48.292 --> 28:50.583
saying I needed to be in Japan.

28:51.833 --> 28:53.958
We stepped off the train in Taiji,

28:54.042 --> 28:56.542
and we were immediately
met by Ric O'Barry,

28:56.625 --> 28:58.708
along with the police.

28:58.750 --> 29:00.167
I'm not entirely sure

29:00.250 --> 29:02.292
Louis knew what he was
getting himself into.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.250
On our initial trip to Japan,

29:05.333 --> 29:08.667
we had a formal meeting
in the town mayor's office

29:05.500 --> 29:09.083
TAIJI MAYOR'S OFFICE

29:08.750 --> 29:10.042
with the fishing union

29:10.083 --> 29:12.292
and with all the proper authorities.

29:12.375 --> 29:16.250
We spent seven hours
trying to negotiate an arrangement

29:13.875 --> 29:15.833
HAYATO SAKURAI
Curator Taiji Whale Museum

29:16.333 --> 29:18.042
where we would try to be
respectful of their side.

29:18.083 --> 29:21.208
That was the point to me,
is get both sides.

29:18.625 --> 29:21.167
KAZUTAKA SANGEN
Mayor of Taiji

29:21.250 --> 29:25.708
And we started to realize
that they were hiding something.

29:25.750 --> 29:28.083
You have to get permission
to get a permit

29:28.125 --> 29:29.417
to get permission to do--

29:29.458 --> 29:32.958
and nobody wants to do
anything without permission.

29:33.042 --> 29:35.708
After two days of negotiations,

29:35.750 --> 29:38.208
they said, "We're not
going to let you do it,"

29:38.250 --> 29:40.000
and they put a map on the table

29:40.083 --> 29:42.208
and pointed with these
red X's on the map.

29:42.250 --> 29:44.750
and said, "Don't go here,
don't go here,

29:44.833 --> 29:46.458
don't go here, don't go here."

29:46.542 --> 29:47.708
And then Charles said--

29:47.792 --> 29:49.917
"Could we just hang on
to that for reference,

29:50.000 --> 29:52.458
just so we know where
we're not supposed to be?"

29:52.542 --> 29:53.750
That kind of thing.

29:53.833 --> 29:58.875
And that became sort of our template
of where we had to go.

30:05.042 --> 30:08.042
The secret cove is a natural fortress.

30:08.125 --> 30:11.917
It's surrounded on three sides
by steep cliffs.

30:13.708 --> 30:14.958
There are several tunnels

30:15.042 --> 30:16.917
that you need to get
through to get there.

30:18.292 --> 30:22.167
High fences surrounded
by razor ribbon.

30:25.333 --> 30:28.708
I've traveled all over the world
throughout my entire life,

30:28.750 --> 30:31.750
and the coastline is majestic.

30:31.833 --> 30:36.042
It's astounding to think
that this horror happens

30:36.083 --> 30:38.958
in one of the most beautiful places.

30:40.625 --> 30:42.417
We snuck up to this park.

30:42.500 --> 30:43.958
It was called Tsunami Park.

30:44.042 --> 30:46.292
It was blockaded,
but we went up there.

30:46.375 --> 30:48.958
The only safe time
to go in Tsunami Park

30:49.042 --> 30:51.250
is when there are no
dolphins in the lagoon.

30:51.292 --> 30:53.625
Then there are no guards around.

30:53.708 --> 30:56.833
Ric pointed down
to the secret lagoon,

30:56.917 --> 31:00.250
and he said, "That's
where all the dirty business happens."

31:00.333 --> 31:01.917
The cops were on our tail,

31:02.000 --> 31:03.750
and I thought, let's get out of here.

31:03.792 --> 31:04.958
We'll try to regroup.

31:05.042 --> 31:08.042
So we went off to do
some sightseeing outside Taiji.

31:10.708 --> 31:12.750
All these beautiful
temples are there,

31:12.833 --> 31:15.583
some of the most beautiful
temples in all of Japan.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.875
I n one of these temples,
they have a dry rock garden

31:19.917 --> 31:21.750
where the monks rake these rocks,

31:21.833 --> 31:23.833
and in the center
they have these rocks

31:23.917 --> 31:27.083
that people come from all
over the world to contemplate.

31:27.125 --> 31:28.292
It was gorgeous,

31:28.375 --> 31:29.917
but I thought, in America,

31:30.000 --> 31:34.375
people would never go
on a Sunday to watch rocks.

31:35.792 --> 31:38.458
Suddenly I got this idea.

31:38.542 --> 31:40.750
What if the rocks looked back?

31:47.792 --> 31:52.875
KERNER OPTICAL
Formerly Industrial Light and Magic
San Rafael, California

31:48.250 --> 31:50.875
This was a big waterfall set

31:50.917 --> 31:53.792
that we constructed
for the movie Evan Almighty.

31:53.875 --> 31:55.875
A dam breaks and floods

31:55.958 --> 31:57.958
and takes the--
washes the road out and--

31:58.042 --> 32:00.042
One of my best friends
and my first assistant

32:00.083 --> 32:02.083
was a guy that became
the head mold maker

32:02.125 --> 32:03.625
at Industrial Light and Magic,

32:03.708 --> 32:07.208
so I called up and said,
" I've got this idea for a project.

32:07.292 --> 32:09.458
" I want to hide
Hi-Def cameras in a rock.

32:09.542 --> 32:10.583
Can you help us?"

32:15.000 --> 32:17.250
Is that what you had in mind?

32:17.292 --> 32:18.625
It's a work of art, man.

32:18.708 --> 32:20.583
We can do all of them
brown if you want,

32:20.667 --> 32:22.875
or we can do a combination
of brown and gray.

32:22.958 --> 32:24.667
I think brown and gray
would be better.

32:24.750 --> 32:27.000
I think this is going
to be a primary for us

32:27.083 --> 32:28.250
that these are all gray.

32:28.292 --> 32:29.583
I would try to keep them

32:29.667 --> 32:31.417
as lower of a profile
as possible because--

32:31.500 --> 32:33.542
We needed a special group of people

32:33.625 --> 32:34.917
to implement this mission.

32:34.958 --> 32:38.375
We needed people with
a special set of skills.

32:38.417 --> 32:39.958
I started to set up this team,

32:40.042 --> 32:42.208
this-- sort of this
Ocean 's Eleven team.

32:42.542 --> 32:46.417
SIMON HUTCHINS
FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA

32:43.833 --> 32:45.083
Simon Hutchins,

32:45.125 --> 32:46.875
the only guy that had
military experience.

32:46.958 --> 32:49.583
Simon created all these weird ways

32:49.625 --> 32:51.792
to hide Hi-Def cameras
and hydrophones.

32:51.875 --> 32:53.875
You know, he's a mad genius.

32:53.958 --> 32:55.917
If we could dream it,
Simon could build it.

32:56.250 --> 33:00.833
JOE CHISHOLM
BOULDER, COLORADO

32:57.375 --> 32:59.250
Joe Chisholm organized rock concerts,

32:59.292 --> 33:01.250
and we were kind of like
a rock concert--

33:01.333 --> 33:02.583
you know, incognito.

33:02.625 --> 33:06.125
You know, we had hundreds
of cases of material

33:06.208 --> 33:07.792
that we had to import into Japan,

33:07.875 --> 33:09.542
and he did the logistics.

33:09.625 --> 33:11.167
Louis came back, and he said, "Look,

33:11.250 --> 33:12.292
we got to get in,"

33:12.375 --> 33:13.667
and Louis and I started discussing

33:13.750 --> 33:15.708
all of the ways that we can film it.

33:15.792 --> 33:18.625
We had a military grade
thermal camera,

33:18.708 --> 33:20.750
which you're not allowed
to bring out of the country.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.292
If it has a pulse,
the thermal camera picks it up.

33:23.375 --> 33:26.625
One thing that we had decided to do
is get some aerial footage,

33:26.708 --> 33:30.208
so we decided to take
our own helicopter with us.

33:30.292 --> 33:33.208
We looked into, you know,
commandeering a satellite

33:33.292 --> 33:34.917
to do satellite pictures.

33:34.958 --> 33:38.208
We decided to make
our own unmanned drone

33:38.292 --> 33:41.250
with a gyro-stabilized
Hi-Def camera below it.

33:41.292 --> 33:43.250
We actually named it Cathy,

33:43.292 --> 33:46.083
and that was purely
out of respect for Ric O'Barry.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.542
The idea there was

33:47.625 --> 33:52.042
that even if the blimp didn't succeed
and we got caught

33:52.125 --> 33:54.750
that everybody loves a balloon--

33:54.833 --> 33:57.000
you know, kids, police, everyone.

33:59.458 --> 34:02.333
One of these devices
that was very important to Louis and l

34:02.417 --> 34:04.458
is the hydrophone--
high tech sound devices

34:04.542 --> 34:06.250
put in underwater housing.

34:06.292 --> 34:08.292
I wanted to hear
the dolphins from the lagoon,

34:08.333 --> 34:10.042
but we didn't know
how deep it was.

34:10.125 --> 34:11.208
We had rebreathers,

34:11.292 --> 34:12.792
but it would be clanky,
it would be noisy.

34:12.875 --> 34:16.208
Mandy-Rae Cruickshank and Kirk Krack

34:13.542 --> 34:16.542
VANCOUVER, B.C.

34:16.292 --> 34:19.042
are world class freedivers.

34:17.750 --> 34:21.375
INTERNATIONAL FREEDIVING COMPETITION

34:19.125 --> 34:20.917
Freediving in its simplest terms,

34:20.958 --> 34:22.958
it's like deep snorkeling.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.375
On one breath we see
how deep we can go in the ocean,

34:25.458 --> 34:27.250
how long we can hold our breath.

34:27.292 --> 34:28.417
Mandy-Rae's owned

34:28.500 --> 34:30.250
eight world championships
in her lifetime.

34:29.583 --> 34:32.833
88 METERS
World Record

34:30.333 --> 34:34.042
She can go down to 300 feet
on one breath of air

34:34.125 --> 34:35.750
and come back on her own power.

34:39.625 --> 34:41.583
They got on board pretty quickly

34:41.667 --> 34:43.625
when they found out
what we wanted to do.

34:50.792 --> 34:53.708
We have some of the same
physiological traits

34:53.792 --> 34:56.292
that whales, seals,
and dolphins have.

34:56.375 --> 34:58.042
We're all air-breathing mammals.

34:58.125 --> 35:00.458
They live in the water.
We live on land.

35:03.625 --> 35:05.542
When you're out
swimming in the ocean

35:05.625 --> 35:08.375
and you have whales
and dolphins come by you,

35:08.458 --> 35:12.583
it is one of the most
incredible experiences ever.

35:12.625 --> 35:15.958
It's so humbling that this wild creature

35:16.042 --> 35:18.875
would come up and be
so interested in you.

35:18.958 --> 35:20.375
It's--

35:20.458 --> 35:22.750
It's unbelievable, really.

35:26.458 --> 35:30.042
Even though there's
obviously no words spoken,

35:30.125 --> 35:34.000
you really feel like you're on some
level communicating with them,

35:34.083 --> 35:37.750
Iike there's an understanding
between the two of you.

35:43.625 --> 35:46.250
I don't normally touch
anything in the water,

35:46.292 --> 35:47.625
but I just thought, you know,

35:47.708 --> 35:49.667
it had been swimming
with me for so long,

35:49.750 --> 35:51.708
I put my hand out in front of me,

35:51.792 --> 35:53.292
and it rolled right into my hand,

35:53.375 --> 35:55.083
and it just stayed there
in front of me,

35:55.125 --> 35:56.417
letting me rub its belly.

35:58.583 --> 36:00.125
Here you have this dolphin,

36:00.208 --> 36:02.500
wild and on its own terms,

36:02.583 --> 36:06.292
come up and really
seek out affection and touch.

36:06.375 --> 36:08.583
It really wanted to be with us.

36:10.792 --> 36:11.875
When they asked us

36:11.958 --> 36:15.667
if we wanted to partake
in a secret ops mission

36:15.750 --> 36:18.083
to uncover the dolphin slaughter,

36:18.125 --> 36:20.208
we without hesitation said,
"Absolutely. Sign us up.

36:20.292 --> 36:22.167
What can we do?"

36:26.583 --> 36:27.917
- This is what--

36:30.042 --> 36:31.083
It's so cool.

36:31.125 --> 36:32.250
Yeah.

36:32.292 --> 36:34.625
I'm just a cute little innocent rock.

36:34.708 --> 36:36.167
Getting these into Customs

36:36.250 --> 36:38.083
is going to be the trick, I think, next.

36:38.167 --> 36:40.125
I hope we'll be able
to find them again

36:40.167 --> 36:41.417
once we plant them.

36:41.458 --> 36:43.958
Actually, come back to the hotel
and we have real rocks.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.458
There's 47 suitcases.

37:01.542 --> 37:04.417
I don't think they're going
to let us carry this on.

37:21.542 --> 37:25.167
We definitely were trying
to be as discreet as possible,

37:25.250 --> 37:29.000
but there's nothing discreet
about Westerners

37:29.083 --> 37:33.042
in a place where there are
no Westerners with big black cases,

37:33.125 --> 37:35.250
and it was noted.

37:37.542 --> 37:39.375
Well, now, there's a car here.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.417
Just-- I just got here yesterday.

37:41.458 --> 37:43.583
You think-- Do you think
they know we're here?

37:45.625 --> 37:47.292
You do?

37:49.208 --> 37:51.292
First morning we arrived in Taiji,

37:51.375 --> 37:53.292
Ric O'Barry met us at our hotel.

37:53.375 --> 37:55.333
He decided that it would
be a good idea

37:55.417 --> 37:56.917
if he'd take us on a tour

37:57.000 --> 37:58.625
so we got the lay of the land.

37:58.708 --> 38:00.125
So we all get in the vehicles,

38:00.167 --> 38:02.458
and one of the first
things we noticed

38:02.542 --> 38:05.250
was that we got an escort.

38:11.292 --> 38:12.875
This is the butcher shop right here,

38:12.958 --> 38:14.458
the slaughterhouse.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.208
This is the union right here,

38:16.292 --> 38:18.083
and there's Private Space.

38:25.792 --> 38:27.292
When we first got in the country,

38:27.333 --> 38:29.500
we had no idea
who was following us.

38:29.583 --> 38:32.875
There was about seven or eight cars
that we had license plates,

38:32.958 --> 38:35.583
so we knew that we were being
followed by these people.

38:35.625 --> 38:37.375
We didn't know
if it was the whalers.

38:37.458 --> 38:40.375
We didn't know if it was Yakuza,
the Japanese Mafia.

38:40.458 --> 38:42.583
We had no idea.

38:43.708 --> 38:45.458
I'd met this guy that spoke English.

38:45.542 --> 38:46.917
He was from
the Whaling Museum,

38:46.958 --> 38:49.833
and I asked him, "Do you know
who's in that car over there?"

38:49.917 --> 38:53.167
He looks over there, and he goes,
"Chief of Police."

38:54.750 --> 38:57.833
If you're around Ric,
they-- they know you're trouble.

39:03.292 --> 39:05.833
No, you can't go in there.

39:06.375 --> 39:08.875
I'm telling you, you can't go in there.

39:09.375 --> 39:10.542
Don't go in there.

39:26.708 --> 39:28.583
What are you going to do?

39:31.042 --> 39:33.292
Our first encounter
with the fishermen

39:33.375 --> 39:36.375
was they went down there
at first break of light,

39:36.458 --> 39:38.125
and as soon as we arrived,

39:38.208 --> 39:40.042
a number of fishermen showed up.

39:41.458 --> 39:44.458
We were down by the beach
looking at...

39:44.500 --> 39:47.250
You could see the blood
coming out of the killing lagoon.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.083
You could see a bunch of the babies

39:49.125 --> 39:51.458
were cordoned off by themselves
away from their parents

39:51.542 --> 39:53.583
while their parents
were all being slaughtered.

39:56.458 --> 40:01.083
And so I wanted to get
a better look into the lagoon,

40:01.167 --> 40:04.750
and as Joe and I tried
to walk down this path,

40:04.792 --> 40:07.958
some of the fishermen came
and actually butted chest against us.

40:09.125 --> 40:10.750
Don't touch the girl.

40:12.125 --> 40:13.417
Trying to stop us

40:13.500 --> 40:15.750
from getting that vantage
point on the killing.

40:15.792 --> 40:17.750
And just after that,

40:17.792 --> 40:20.292
We walked down
to the water's edge,

40:20.333 --> 40:23.375
and this one poor dolphin, it...

40:23.458 --> 40:25.667
You could see it
trying to get away,

40:25.750 --> 40:27.958
and it was swimming
straight for us and the shore,

40:28.042 --> 40:30.958
and it actually made it
over a couple of the nets,

40:31.042 --> 40:33.083
and every time
it came up for a breath,

40:33.125 --> 40:36.208
you could see all this blood
coming out behind it,

40:36.292 --> 40:39.292
and you could see
the last couple of breaths it took,

40:39.375 --> 40:42.000
and then it went down,
and we never saw it again.

41:28.583 --> 41:29.917
Bye-bye-bye-bye.

41:34.792 --> 41:38.250
It's a relatively small group of people
who are doing this.

41:38.292 --> 41:40.417
Outside these few remote villages,

41:40.458 --> 41:44.417
most of the population
doesn't even know this is going on.

41:46.250 --> 41:49.417
The fishermen here who do this
tell you "This is our tradition.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.042
"This is our culture.

41:51.125 --> 41:52.375
"You don't understand us.

41:52.458 --> 41:55.000
You eat cows.
Well, we eat dolphins."

41:55.083 --> 41:58.542
Well, the truth is that's the big lie.

41:58.625 --> 42:00.625
How can it be their culture, their tradition,

42:00.708 --> 42:04.083
if the Japanese people
don't even know about it?

42:04.167 --> 42:08.625
TOKYO, JAPAN

42:05.708 --> 42:09.458
23,000 dolphins
are killed for meat every year.

42:09.458 --> 42:11.917
23,000 dolphins are killed for human
consumption each year in Japan.

42:11.917 --> 42:13.167
Do you know about that?

42:13.208 --> 42:14.958
Do you know about that?
-No, I never heard of it.

42:14.167 --> 42:15.417
You never heard of it?

42:15.792 --> 42:22.042
You're lying! Are they eaten? Really?

42:22.500 --> 42:24.375
It's hard to imagine people eat dolphins.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.542
Why don't I know this? How can it be?
Is dolphin meat in Tokyo?

42:26.542 --> 42:27.542
Why don't I know this? How can it be?
Is dolphin meat in Tokyo?

42:27.583 --> 42:29.958
We don't regard dolphin as food.

42:29.958 --> 42:32.708
Dolphins are rather something
we enjoy to watch.

42:33.083 --> 42:36.542
If it's really true,
we should be making a big issue of it.

42:37.417 --> 42:41.042
I don't think anyone knows about it.
I never knew.

42:42.292 --> 42:44.917
People in Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo--

42:45.000 --> 42:47.417
the reason they don't know about it

42:47.458 --> 42:50.083
is because of a media cover-up,

42:50.125 --> 42:52.625
a systematic, deliberate cover-up,

42:52.708 --> 42:54.750
a media blackout,

42:54.833 --> 42:59.625
because the dolphin meat
is heavily laced with mercury.

42:59.917 --> 43:03.250
Mercury is the most toxic,
non-radioactive element on Earth.

43:04.208 --> 43:11.667
Mercury levels in the environment have risen 1 to 3%
every year since the Industrial Revolution
due to the burning of fossil fuels.

43:12.792 --> 43:14.333
Mercury starts in the environment

43:14.417 --> 43:16.292
with the smallest of organisms,

43:16.333 --> 43:18.375
and every step of the ladder up,

43:18.458 --> 43:20.625
it gets magnified about ten times...

43:21.792 --> 43:24.542
until the top of the food chain,

43:24.625 --> 43:27.292
where you get these
incredibly toxic levels.

43:27.375 --> 43:29.750
All the fish that we love most to eat--

43:28.208 --> 43:33.000
ROGER PAYNE, PH.D.
Ocean Alliance

43:29.792 --> 43:32.042
things like striped bass, bluefish,

43:32.125 --> 43:34.292
tuna, swordfish, marlin--

43:34.375 --> 43:37.375
this is a major source of mercury,

43:37.458 --> 43:40.750
and these substances
are causing real problems,

43:40.792 --> 43:43.083
not just to dolphins, but to people,

43:43.125 --> 43:46.083
because people and dolphins feed

43:46.125 --> 43:49.042
at the same level of a food chain.

43:49.125 --> 43:51.667
If you looked at bottlenose dolphins--

43:51.750 --> 43:53.583
that's Flipper, by the way--

43:53.625 --> 43:56.167
you'd discover, in fact,

43:56.250 --> 44:00.208
these animals are swimming
toxic dump sites.

44:00.292 --> 44:04.750
It's better to refrain
from taking those meats--

44:01.792 --> 44:08.833
HIDEKI MORONUKI
Deputy Director, Fisheries Agency of Japan
Manager of Cetacean Quotas

44:06.167 --> 44:07.167
how do I say?

44:07.250 --> 44:08.333
Too much.

44:08.583 --> 44:14.583
But still dolphin meat
contains some valuable nutrients.

44:14.333 --> 44:20.875
DAN GOODMAN
Legal Advisor to Japan's IWC Delegation

44:14.625 --> 44:15.917
This is a matter

44:15.958 --> 44:20.458
that the consumer affairs
and health ministries are looking after,

44:20.542 --> 44:24.458
and I can assure you
that there is no product on the market

44:24.500 --> 44:27.708
that exceeds any of their standards.

44:27.792 --> 44:30.417
By their standards.

44:30.875 --> 44:34.042
TETSUYA ENDO, PH.D.
Health Sciences University of Hokkaido

44:34.708 --> 44:40.958
The recommended total level of mercury
in seafood in Japan is 0.4 ppm (parts per million).

44:41.250 --> 44:43.083
This is dolphin meat.

44:43.792 --> 44:47.125
This is containing 2000 ppm...

44:47.542 --> 44:50.583
2000 ppm of mercury.

44:50.583 --> 44:53.583
Very, very, very high. Toxic.

44:53.792 --> 44:57.167
I purchased it from Wakayama Prefecture, Taiji.

44:58.708 --> 45:01.917
Almost nobody eats dolphin meat,

45:01.958 --> 45:06.250
but 23,000 are slaughtered every year,

45:06.292 --> 45:07.917
so that begs the question,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.583
Where is all this meat going?

45:12.917 --> 45:15.667
Dolphin meat is generally considered
to be a less desirable commodity,

45:16.083 --> 45:19.375
C. SCOTT BAKER PH.D.
Specialist in DNA Species Identification
Oregon State University

45:16.750 --> 45:19.792
and it would sell for far, far less
if it was properly labeled.

45:19.875 --> 45:24.625
So the meat is distributed
much more widely than we recognize.

45:24.708 --> 45:27.292
Scott Baker set up a portable DNA lab

45:27.375 --> 45:29.417
at a hotel in downtown Tokyo.

45:29.458 --> 45:32.250
We brought him samples,
and he analyzed them

45:32.292 --> 45:34.583
and found that
a lot of the packages

45:34.625 --> 45:37.042
that were labeled
as expensive meat from larger whales

45:37.125 --> 45:38.625
was actually dolphin meat.

45:38.708 --> 45:41.792
A consumer may think
they're buying healthy meat

45:41.875 --> 45:43.750
from whales from
the southern hemisphere,

45:43.792 --> 45:46.083
and they might be getting
a bottlenose dolphin

45:46.125 --> 45:47.417
from the coast of Taiji

45:47.458 --> 45:51.083
with levels of mercury
that are 20 times higher

45:51.125 --> 45:53.542
than World Health
Organization recommendations.

45:53.625 --> 45:55.375
The fishermen
who are eating dolphin

45:55.458 --> 45:56.917
are poisoning themselves,

45:57.000 --> 45:58.458
but they're also poisoning

45:58.542 --> 46:00.583
the people that they're selling it to.

46:00.625 --> 46:02.125
And the government knows this,

46:02.167 --> 46:03.625
and the government's covering this up.

46:06.167 --> 46:10.458
They had this problem
once before in Minamata.

46:10.500 --> 46:14.083
That's where mercury poisoning
was first discovered.

46:15.250 --> 46:18.000
They called it Minamata disease.

46:18.667 --> 46:22.750
MINAMATA, JAPAN

46:23.833 --> 46:27.167
The sickness broke out in 1956.

46:29.708 --> 46:35.667
The most advanced factory in Japan,
Chisso Minamata, had been secretly
dumping its waste into the bay.

46:36.958 --> 46:41.917
For 12 years, the Japanese government
and Chisso conspired to cover up
the connection.

46:44.292 --> 46:47.708
Japan has a history
of this terrible Minamata tragedy,

46:47.792 --> 46:50.250
sometimes referred to
as Minamata disease.

46:50.333 --> 46:52.625
But it's not a disease. It's not caught.

46:52.667 --> 46:55.417
It's the result of this toxicity.

46:58.125 --> 47:01.167
The most serious health risk
of these high levels of mercury

47:01.250 --> 47:02.417
is to pregnant women.

47:02.458 --> 47:05.417
It's the fetus that's most sensitive
to these levels of mercury.

47:06.583 --> 47:10.042
Have you heard of the children
born with Minamata disease?

47:11.958 --> 47:16.208
Heads that loll, eyes that can't see,
ears that can't hear...

47:16.833 --> 47:20.125
...mouths that can't speak or taste...

47:20.333 --> 47:24.125
...hands that can't grasp, legs that
wont walk.

47:28.042 --> 47:31.542
The children were
starting to be born deformed.

47:31.625 --> 47:33.500
And it's going to happen again.

47:35.792 --> 47:38.708
Nobody has really looked
into the hospitals,

47:38.792 --> 47:40.583
looked into the records

47:40.625 --> 47:43.792
to see how many people
there have mercury poisoning.

47:43.875 --> 47:46.292
The symptoms are memory loss,

47:44.833 --> 47:53.000
EFFECT OF MERCURY ON BRAIN NEURON

47:46.333 --> 47:49.417
loss of hearing,
loss of your eyesight.

47:49.458 --> 47:51.625
It doesn't just knock you over dead.

47:51.708 --> 47:53.500
It takes a while.

47:53.583 --> 47:54.958
And that's happening.

47:56.458 --> 47:58.875
Does he want to know
if he's poisoning the bodies

47:58.958 --> 48:00.792
of other Japanese
that he's selling the meat to?

48:00.875 --> 48:02.125
He doesn't want to know.

48:02.208 --> 48:04.208
He doesn't want to know about it.

48:04.292 --> 48:06.542
Well, in Minamata,
the government said

48:06.625 --> 48:08.667
they weren't poisoning the people
in Minamata, either.

48:08.750 --> 48:09.958
Remember that?

48:10.042 --> 48:11.292
The Chisso factory?

48:12.333 --> 48:13.333
The Chisso factory?

48:13.417 --> 48:15.125
Same thing, same problem.

48:15.208 --> 48:21.833
HIDEKI MORONUKI
Deputy Director, Fisheries Agency of Japan
Manager of Cetacean Quotas

48:15.208 --> 48:17.167
You don't think there's
a cover-up going on

48:17.250 --> 48:18.958
with the amount of mercury
in dolphin meat?

48:19.042 --> 48:22.583
I don't think that a similar
tragedy would happen

48:22.625 --> 48:24.417
because of the dolphin meat.

48:24.458 --> 48:26.083
I don't think so.

48:28.083 --> 48:29.792
Ultimately, the dolphin meat

48:29.833 --> 48:32.458
is based on supply and demand
like any other product,

48:32.542 --> 48:35.167
and if that product is poison

48:35.250 --> 48:37.125
and they can't sell it in Taiji,

48:37.167 --> 48:39.000
then they can't sell it in Iwate,

48:39.083 --> 48:40.708
and they can't sell it in Okinawa,

48:40.792 --> 48:43.125
and they can't sell it wherever else
they're selling it.

48:43.208 --> 48:47.708
So you have to stay focused
on that one lagoon in Taiji, I think,

48:47.792 --> 48:50.083
in order to shut this down.

48:52.750 --> 48:54.750
Howdy. How are you doing today?

49:01.125 --> 49:04.583
If we got arrested,
how long before they charged us?

49:04.625 --> 49:06.625
They don't have to
charge you with anything.

49:06.667 --> 49:08.208
The way the law works in Japan,

49:08.292 --> 49:11.958
they can keep you in jail
with no charges for 28 days.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.500
90% of the convictions in Japan

49:15.583 --> 49:19.417
are obtained by confessions
during those 28 days

49:19.458 --> 49:21.583
because they can
torture you legally.

49:21.667 --> 49:24.083
They can wake you up
in the middle of the night,

49:24.125 --> 49:25.458
all night long, you know, and--

49:25.500 --> 49:27.250
I've been doing that to them all week.

49:27.333 --> 49:28.292
That may be aggressive--

49:28.375 --> 49:29.417
Can we prosecute him?

49:31.792 --> 49:33.042
I came to realize

49:33.125 --> 49:35.792
that this was going to be
a much longer process,

49:35.875 --> 49:40.250
so we utilized our time over there
doing reconnaissance, planning.

49:40.333 --> 49:42.375
We observed.

49:42.458 --> 49:45.125
There's two crews
that went in last night--

49:45.167 --> 49:47.042
the guys that come
out of the tunnel.

49:47.125 --> 49:49.042
They're sent to look on the left side.

49:49.125 --> 49:51.083
They shine their flashlights.
They go pretty quick

49:51.167 --> 49:53.250
because they want
to get to work and start out.

49:53.333 --> 49:55.292
What they're doing is looking
for little snap branches.

49:55.375 --> 49:57.750
They normally go up there

49:57.792 --> 49:59.458
when they have dolphins
in the lagoon.

49:59.500 --> 50:01.458
They go up and see if anybody's
photographed them.

50:01.542 --> 50:03.292
What I'm thinking
is we go in there.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.417
Maybe I use that location
that has a branch,

50:05.458 --> 50:08.458
and I cut the branch on a night
when there's no dolphins.

50:08.542 --> 50:10.667
There was two parts to the mission.

50:10.750 --> 50:13.375
The first one was to get
the auditory experience.

50:13.458 --> 50:16.375
Where can we drop a big
housing skull like this

50:16.458 --> 50:18.667
with arms sticking out?
Let's try getting that.

50:18.750 --> 50:21.375
We could plant hydrophones
on the side of the lagoon

50:21.458 --> 50:23.125
that was easiest to get into.

50:23.208 --> 50:25.833
It's a lot easier getting down
the left side of the lagoon.

50:25.917 --> 50:29.375
The right side is right in the center
of the killing cove.

50:29.458 --> 50:30.875
I go first with the thermal camera.

50:30.958 --> 50:32.917
I can tell if there's
any movement over there.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.292
If they're hiding in the bushes,

50:34.333 --> 50:35.625
they're going to be popping out.

50:35.708 --> 50:38.250
So the hydrophone was
sort of a trial run

50:38.333 --> 50:39.792
to see if we could get away with it.

50:39.833 --> 50:41.292
You guys go in with two cameras, right?

50:41.375 --> 50:42.375
Three cameras.

50:42.458 --> 50:43.458
The second mission,

50:43.542 --> 50:45.417
what we call the full orchestra.

50:45.458 --> 50:47.042
Let's go, then, with three cameras--

50:47.125 --> 50:48.458
you're 2, you're 1 --

50:48.542 --> 50:49.917
and think about fourth.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.583
We would plant all the rocks,

50:51.667 --> 50:54.125
the hydrophones, underwater cameras.

50:54.167 --> 50:57.750
They have scuba divers,
so they just sweep.

50:57.833 --> 50:59.750
They're straining the bottom of that bay,

50:59.833 --> 51:01.625
so we don't want them to
pick up underwater cameras.

51:01.708 --> 51:03.958
Once you get right here, you're safe.

51:04.042 --> 51:06.417
This is the first sign
that says "Do not enter."

51:06.500 --> 51:08.375
- We don't know what it says.
- "Danger."

51:08.458 --> 51:09.583
We have no idea.

51:09.667 --> 51:11.625
It says "Welcome to Taiji"
for all we know.

51:11.667 --> 51:13.000
"Enjoy our wonderful UNESCO site."

51:13.083 --> 51:15.500
I wanted to have
a three-dimensional experience

51:15.583 --> 51:17.500
with what's going on in that lagoon.

51:17.583 --> 51:20.417
I wanted to hear everything
that the dolphins were doing,

51:20.500 --> 51:22.125
everything that the whalers were saying.

51:22.167 --> 51:26.125
The effort wasn't just
to show the slaughter.

51:26.167 --> 51:29.792
You want to capture something
that will make people change.

51:31.292 --> 51:35.417
This weekend, the thin, mournful cry
of the humpback whale

51:34.042 --> 51:38.083
LONDON, 1971

51:35.500 --> 51:37.917
echoed through London's
Trafalgar Square,

51:38.000 --> 51:39.750
as thousands of demonstrators

51:39.833 --> 51:42.417
demanded an end to all whale killing.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.917
In the 1960s,

51:44.000 --> 51:45.375
when the IWC wasn't doing anything

51:45.458 --> 51:47.208
about the slaughter of large whales,

51:47.292 --> 51:48.625
there was one guy, Roger Payne,

51:48.708 --> 51:50.625
who helped start the whole
Save the Whale movement

51:50.667 --> 51:51.792
by exposing to the world

51:51.833 --> 51:53.000
that these animals were singing.

51:53.083 --> 51:54.750
That was profound.

51:54.042 --> 51:58.667
The recordings of whale songs helped spark the
world's first environmental movement.

51:54.833 --> 51:55.958
What do we want?

51:56.042 --> 51:57.125
Save the whales!

51:57.208 --> 51:58.458
When do we want it?

51:58.542 --> 52:01.083
Save the Whale demonstrators
were out again today.

52:01.167 --> 52:03.875
And they are determined to see
that something be done about it.

52:03.958 --> 52:07.833
At the time, about 33,000 whales
a year were being killed.

52:07.875 --> 52:11.833
ROGER PAYNE, PH.D.
Ocean Alliance

52:07.917 --> 52:12.417
We got it down eventually
to about 330, 1% of that amount.

52:12.500 --> 52:15.875
It's now going back up again.

52:15.958 --> 52:19.208
There has to be a new generation
that takes over from here.

52:19.292 --> 52:21.917
There's only so many Ric O'Barrys
and Roger Paynes.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.792
They're all in their 60s and 70s now,

52:23.833 --> 52:26.375
and there's not a lot
of people out there

52:26.458 --> 52:28.292
picking up where they've left off.

52:35.333 --> 52:36.625
I like this.

52:36.708 --> 52:39.417
It sinks very slowly, this line.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.042
MISSION 1
PLANTING HYDROPHONES

52:39.500 --> 52:40.625
It does sink, but it's very slow,

52:40.708 --> 52:42.958
so I just put a couple weights on it.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.792
We're going to have these two
hydrophones connected to it.

52:45.875 --> 52:47.833
- One thing, though.
- Yeah.

52:47.875 --> 52:49.250
I took all the other stickers off, see?

52:49.333 --> 52:50.292
Go on the--

52:50.375 --> 52:51.417
"Please return dry."

52:51.500 --> 52:52.708
Yeah, let's take the sticker off.

52:52.792 --> 52:53.750
Okay? Jesus.

52:54.833 --> 53:00.125
(03) 3224-5000.

53:01.167 --> 53:04.333
That's the cell phone number
for the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo

53:03.667 --> 53:07.292
BROOK AITKEN
OPS Cameraman

53:04.417 --> 53:09.542
as well as the cell phone numbers
of our other two phones,

53:09.625 --> 53:13.083
just in case something shits the bed.

53:15.375 --> 53:18.125
When we very discreetly
leave the hotel room

53:18.208 --> 53:21.333
with four or five guys
dressed in black

53:21.417 --> 53:23.417
with camera equipment,

53:23.500 --> 53:25.250
we have it timed really well.

53:25.333 --> 53:27.000
We know when the guard turns up.

53:27.083 --> 53:29.542
We know how far the cop
is going to be behind us.

53:29.625 --> 53:31.292
We know how long
it takes the cops

53:31.375 --> 53:33.792
to get from the next village there.

53:33.833 --> 53:36.458
It was probably
the scariest night of my life

53:36.500 --> 53:38.250
because we'd been up
many days in a row

53:38.333 --> 53:39.375
preparing for this.

53:39.458 --> 53:41.208
We're exposed out there.

53:41.292 --> 53:43.458
There's very few places we could hide.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.708
Let's go you guys.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.333
Louie? It's Simon.

53:59.375 --> 54:01.625
We're gonna go up on the path.
Is that okay?

54:04.542 --> 54:05.708
Yeah, go on.

54:06.125 --> 54:07.333
Mandy first.

54:08.167 --> 54:08.542
Roger that.

54:15.792 --> 54:18.083
Charles, I'm gonna start heading
toward the big rock.

54:19.292 --> 54:20.667
Copy that.

54:27.458 --> 54:28.708
I'm over it. All clear.

54:37.250 --> 54:39.083
That light is awful bright.

54:39.333 --> 54:40.875
Keep that light off as much as possible.

54:41.625 --> 54:43.417
You can see that all
the way across the harbor.

54:58.917 --> 55:00.833
Keep the light down.

55:01.208 --> 55:02.542
Keep it down!

55:16.542 --> 55:19.458
Louie, can you check with the thermal?

55:19.667 --> 55:22.708
He looks like he just dove.
Is that the case?

55:28.542 --> 55:30.708
Standby...wait, what's that?

55:31.292 --> 55:34.500
I saw two figures, white hot, on the screen

55:34.750 --> 55:37.083
in the road up ahead
of me around the bend.

55:38.375 --> 55:40.958
Okay, we think that there's a
couple of guys on us right now.

55:40.958 --> 55:42.083
Just hold steady.

55:42.542 --> 55:43.875
Is somebody standing?

55:44.750 --> 55:45.292
What?

55:45.375 --> 55:47.042
Is somebody standing out there?

55:47.292 --> 55:49.250
Okay, there's a flashlight coming
along the path here.

55:49.958 --> 55:51.500
This might be interesting.

55:52.250 --> 55:53.625
Did you see somebody on that side?

55:54.042 --> 55:55.542
I definitely saw a flashlight.

55:56.250 --> 55:57.042
Let's go.

55:58.458 --> 55:59.708
Get out of there.

56:00.125 --> 56:01.292
Get out of there now.

56:02.042 --> 56:04.458
Sound device is in the water.

56:04.708 --> 56:05.833
Stay put.

56:07.792 --> 56:09.250
Call Joe.

56:09.333 --> 56:10.583
Joe.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.250
Roger that. On my way.
Two minutes.

56:13.083 --> 56:15.458
Guards are moving.

56:16.375 --> 56:18.042
Let's go, let's go.

56:18.250 --> 56:19.708
We're down on the steps by the tunnel.

56:20.833 --> 56:22.125
Joe, is that you?

56:22.167 --> 56:23.417
It's him.

56:24.042 --> 56:25.167
Here he is.
Go.

56:31.458 --> 56:32.667
Here you go.

56:33.792 --> 56:35.458
Come on. Let's go. Go.

56:36.542 --> 56:38.083
Holy Christ.

56:39.583 --> 56:40.708
Nice work.

56:40.792 --> 56:42.583
Jesus.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.875
100% of the people in the vehicle?

56:45.958 --> 56:47.458
It's a good night.

56:47.500 --> 56:48.792
That's a good night.

56:51.792 --> 56:53.833
It is a strange action...

56:54.000 --> 56:58.792
in the middle of the night, early morning...
masked person.

56:57.750 --> 56:58.750
Me?

56:59.000 --> 57:01.583
OPS... OPS member.

56:59.792 --> 57:01.125
I don't know.

57:01.167 --> 57:02.292
I don't know.

57:02.333 --> 57:03.375
Not me.

57:03.458 --> 57:05.375
At midnight, I'm sleeping.

57:06.750 --> 57:11.042
He says that he doesn't know
because he is asleep.

57:12.125 --> 57:14.583
Maybe the person is an OPS member, I think.

57:14.833 --> 57:15.792
I don't know.

57:15.875 --> 57:17.167
I cannot speak for OPS.

57:17.250 --> 57:19.833
I can only speak for Ric O'Barry.

57:19.917 --> 57:22.958
I cannot speak
for anybody except myself.

57:23.042 --> 57:25.125
At midnight, I'm sleeping.

57:25.208 --> 57:26.458
No, no, no.

57:26.208 --> 57:29.250
But the, uh, other OPS member is...

57:27.833 --> 57:29.125
I don't know.

57:30.458 --> 57:31.708
I'm not OPS.

57:32.208 --> 57:34.542
You have no connection with OPS?
-I'm not OPS, no.

57:34.958 --> 57:36.083
Well, I do interviews.

57:36.167 --> 57:37.917
Anybody who wants to talk to me,

57:38.000 --> 57:39.458
- I will talk to them.
- Yes?

57:39.542 --> 57:42.625
OPS wants to talk to me,
I talk to them.

57:42.708 --> 57:45.500
I talk to anybody
about mercury poisoning.

57:45.792 --> 57:48.167
He brings up mercury again.

57:48.667 --> 57:49.875
- Thank you.
- Okay.

57:49.958 --> 57:51.333
Thank you so much for your time.

57:51.375 --> 57:53.333
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

58:03.458 --> 58:07.458
I think the most horrifying thing
about the whole dive that night

58:07.542 --> 58:09.042
was that, you know,
you could hear them

58:09.125 --> 58:11.417
communicating with each other,

58:11.500 --> 58:15.333
and you knew that that next morning
that would be the end of it.

58:15.375 --> 58:17.583
They'd be silenced forever.

58:19.875 --> 58:23.250
They're always trying
to communicate with us,

58:23.333 --> 58:24.417
and that's hard to explain,

58:24.500 --> 58:25.458
but when you live with them

58:25.542 --> 58:28.000
Iike I did on the Flipper TV show
day and night,

58:28.042 --> 58:30.958
I could read that body language.

58:37.167 --> 58:38.583
There's something visceral

58:38.667 --> 58:42.083
about being in the water
with an animal like this.

58:42.167 --> 58:43.542
As a scientist,

58:43.333 --> 58:50.208
DR. JOHN POTTER
Underwater Acoustics Consultant

58:43.625 --> 58:47.417
I'm trained to recognize intelligence
through objective measures--

58:47.500 --> 58:49.292
tool use, cognitive processes,
and so on.

58:49.333 --> 58:50.625
As a human being,

58:50.667 --> 58:55.125
when I see a dolphin looking at me
and his eyes tracking me

58:55.208 --> 58:57.750
and I lock eyes with that animal,

58:57.833 --> 59:00.167
there's a human response
that makes it undeniable

59:00.208 --> 59:02.792
that I'm connecting
with an intelligent being.

59:05.125 --> 59:08.625
Science has been tantalized for years
at the prospect of talking

59:08.667 --> 59:10.708
to the most intelligent
creatures on earth,

59:10.792 --> 59:12.208
which may not be human beings.

59:12.292 --> 59:13.667
A small group of scientists

59:13.750 --> 59:16.083
determined to see
if humans and dolphins

59:16.167 --> 59:17.708
can learn to talk to each other.

59:17.792 --> 59:22.583
We keep spending billions of dollars
for sending signals up into the sky,

59:22.667 --> 59:24.083
and we have a species here

59:24.167 --> 59:27.917
that can conceivably be
more intelligent than we are.

59:36.792 --> 59:39.833
Dolphins can understand
how to manipulate situations,

59:39.917 --> 59:41.292
how to relate to people,

59:41.333 --> 59:45.958
how to create innovatively
out of their own imagination.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.333
It sometimes amazes me

59:47.375 --> 59:48.958
that the only language

59:49.042 --> 59:51.208
which has been extensively
taught to dolphins

59:51.292 --> 59:53.292
is a version of
American Sign Language,

59:53.375 --> 59:54.792
which, of course,
you use your hands,

59:54.833 --> 59:56.625
so you have
all these wonderful signals,

59:56.667 --> 59:59.500
and people use their hands
to give messages to dolphins.

01:00:01.042 --> 01:00:03.125
And this somehow
kind of misses the point

01:00:03.167 --> 01:00:05.292
because dolphins don't have hands,

01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:08.292
so this is inherently
a very one-way process.

01:00:08.333 --> 01:00:10.083
And it's this anthropomorphic

01:00:10.167 --> 01:00:13.000
"We have something
to teach them or control them,"

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:16.083
and perhaps we ought to be looking
at what they can give to us.

01:00:18.792 --> 01:00:21.292
It's not about intelligence.

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:24.042
It's about consciousness.

01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:28.542
They are self-aware,
like humans are self-aware.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:30.458
That means that we look in the mirror,

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.458
and we know exactly
what we're looking at.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:37.625
I don't believe that the fishermen
here are aware of that.

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:44.042
When they're in that killing cove

01:00:44.125 --> 01:00:47.250
and their babies are being
slaughtered in front of them,

01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:48.917
they're aware of that.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.208
They can anticipate
what's going to happen to them.

01:01:17.542 --> 01:01:18.917
It's an eerie sound, isn't it?

01:01:20.458 --> 01:01:23.125
The dolphins we're hearing now are all dead.

01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:25.792
Tomorrow there will be
another group replacing them.

01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:42.125
The first time I went to Taiji
was in 1980,

01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:46.083
HARDY JONES
Founder, BlueVoice.org

01:01:43.167 --> 01:01:46.542
and I had been to Iki the year before.

01:01:46.292 --> 01:01:51.833
IKI, JAPAN

01:01:46.625 --> 01:01:50.625
Iki is a tourist destination for Japanese

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:52.667
which became infamous

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:56.458
for this-- most ghastly
slaughters of dolphins.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:00.125
I mean, literally thousands of them
would-- could be killed in a day.

01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:08.458
Well, I went back to Iki
about three years ago,

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.292
and they don't have any dolphins,

01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:15.167
where once they had thousands of them
streaming by the coast.

01:02:23.333 --> 01:02:25.083
Irony of ironies.

01:02:25.167 --> 01:02:29.542
Because the international
captivity trade is so lucrative,

01:02:29.625 --> 01:02:31.667
they want to be in on it,

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:34.708
and they don't have any dolphins.

01:02:36.458 --> 01:02:38.625
They have to have dolphins
for their dolphin parks,

01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:41.625
so they go buy them in Taiji now.

01:02:44.167 --> 01:02:47.292
Every cetacean known to man
is endangered

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:49.458
just by going anywhere near Japan.

01:02:53.583 --> 01:02:58.000
We asked the Taiji fishermen
if we could subsidize this activity--

01:02:58.042 --> 01:03:00.833
in other words, if you leave the boats
tied up at the dock,

01:03:00.875 --> 01:03:02.833
we'll pay you the same amount of money

01:03:02.917 --> 01:03:06.958
you would have made
killing dolphins in Taiji.

01:03:07.042 --> 01:03:10.333
They got back to us and said
"It's not about money.

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:13.542
It's about pest control."

01:03:13.625 --> 01:03:14.917
Pest control.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
In other words,

01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:19.583
they're being told by the government

01:03:19.667 --> 01:03:24.500
that the dolphin are
eating too much fish in the ocean.

01:03:27.583 --> 01:03:32.208
Since 2003, Japan has cited scientific data
blaming the decline in global fisheries
on dolphins and whales.

01:03:32.667 --> 01:03:38.625
This is not attempt
just to incriminate whales as a bad guy.

01:03:38.708 --> 01:03:44.417
However, we cannot ignore
the fishing effort has been decreasing.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:50.250
It's seriously hard to take that
PowerPoint demonstration seriously.

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.833
AUSTRALIA

01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:54.500
I have to tell you
that there is very strong evidence

01:03:54.542 --> 01:03:58.333
that whales are consuming
huge quantities of fish

01:03:58.375 --> 01:04:01.292
that are also the target of fisheries.

01:04:01.333 --> 01:04:03.667
The Government of Brazil
wants to put on record

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:06.375
BRAZIL

01:04:03.708 --> 01:04:05.667
that to us it certainly amounts

01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:08.750
to what only can be described
as biological nonsense.

01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:11.292
It is clear that the fisheries
of the world are on decline,

01:04:11.333 --> 01:04:14.250
and the obvious culprit is people,

01:04:14.333 --> 01:04:16.833
and we don't want to acknowledge that.

01:04:17.542 --> 01:04:23.292
TSUKIJI MARKET, TOKYO
Largest Fish Market in the World

01:04:25.625 --> 01:04:29.625
We look at the ocean
as a source of infinite quality seafood,

01:04:29.667 --> 01:04:31.792
and I think we're learning
some hard lessons

01:04:31.833 --> 01:04:33.125
that this isn't true.

01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:39.458
We're pulling the fish
out of the ocean at such a rate

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.292
and eroding and diminishing
our marine ecosystems

01:04:42.333 --> 01:04:45.083
so bad that the whole
thing could collapse.

01:04:49.083 --> 01:04:54.875
A 2006 report in the journal Science
predicts a total collapse of the world's fish stocks
within 40 years at the current rate of fishing.

01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:01.542
70% of human beings,
seven out of ten people,

01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:04.333
rely as their principal
protein on seafood.

01:05:06.083 --> 01:05:09.500
If we lose access to fish in the sea,

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:13.542
we will be causing
the biggest public health problem

01:05:13.625 --> 01:05:16.083
human beings have ever faced.

01:05:21.333 --> 01:05:25.542
The Japanese literally control
the world marketplace in fish.

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:29.542
They have buyers in every
major port in the world.

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:34.000
They're catching their fish
from an ever-depleting supply,

01:05:34.042 --> 01:05:37.958
and I think they have a real fear
that they will run out of food.

01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:44.083
What more logical thing could they do
than catch whales to replace them?

01:05:45.542 --> 01:05:50.625
International Whaling Commission
is essentially killing

01:05:50.708 --> 01:05:55.042
coastal small-type
whaling communities like Taiji.

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:59.958
The Japanese delegation has sought to overturn the
IWC ban on commercial whaling since 1986.

01:06:02.833 --> 01:06:06.625
In recent years, they have recruited
a powerful voting bloc of support.

01:06:07.125 --> 01:06:12.333
This body should seriously consider
the proposal that is before us.

01:06:10.083 --> 01:06:11.917
ST. KITTS

01:06:12.375 --> 01:06:16.458
Dominica would like to compliment
the Japanese delegation.

01:06:16.292 --> 01:06:17.542
DOMINICA

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.042
We strongly support the proposal.

01:06:18.125 --> 01:06:21.542
Antigua and Barbuda
supports this declaration in its entirety.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.083
ANTIGUA and BARBUDA

01:06:21.625 --> 01:06:24.125
Do we have any concern, any sympathy

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:25.625
ST. LUCIA

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:26.083
for the plight of the people of Japan?

01:06:26.167 --> 01:06:29.000
This is an opportunity to help Japan.

01:06:29.042 --> 01:06:32.250
We could help the Japanese cause
and the people of Taiji.

01:06:32.333 --> 01:06:36.208
We therefore urge this IWC to grant--

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:38.917
ANTIGUA and BARBUDA

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:39.292
...their basic request
for them to engage in whaling.

01:06:39.375 --> 01:06:43.292
And therefore, St. Kitts and Nevis
support this proposal.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:44.625
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:49.750
In my opinion, this has
been sufficient enough time

01:06:49.833 --> 01:06:55.292
to allow for the replenishment
of species-- of certain species--

01:06:55.375 --> 01:06:56.583
which were in decline

01:06:56.667 --> 01:06:59.000
and some others which were
nearing extinction.

01:06:59.042 --> 01:07:03.292
There are several facets in the interests
out of Antigua in whaling.

01:07:03.250 --> 01:07:07.250
JOHN FULLER
Former IWC Delegate for Antigua and Barbuda

01:07:03.333 --> 01:07:04.667
First of all, the government

01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:06.667
is presently interested
in the whaling commission

01:07:06.750 --> 01:07:09.417
because the Japanese government's
paying them to be interested.

01:07:10.625 --> 01:07:13.000
The Japanese government
and their agencies

01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:16.500
go to small bankrupt nations

01:07:16.542 --> 01:07:19.375
and offer them financial support,

01:07:19.458 --> 01:07:20.958
offer them whatever it takes,

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.625
firstly to get them to join the IWC

01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:26.083
and then, when they get here,
to vote for Japan.

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:29.375
This is how whaling
in the 21st century works.

01:07:29.458 --> 01:07:31.458
What kind of whales
pass through Antigua?

01:07:31.542 --> 01:07:33.708
We have...

01:07:33.792 --> 01:07:34.958
I think the Commissioner might be--

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.125
I think there's
some humpback whales--

01:07:36.167 --> 01:07:37.208
- Yes.
-...that pass through Antigua.

01:07:37.292 --> 01:07:38.500
I'm not sure of the details

01:07:38.542 --> 01:07:39.750
of the whales that pass
through Antigua

01:07:39.833 --> 01:07:41.708
at this point in time,
but there are whales

01:07:41.792 --> 01:07:43.417
that pass through our waters
from time to time.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:44.875
I have seen only--

01:07:44.958 --> 01:07:48.292
My only interaction with whales
are what I see on television.

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:54.667
It is so transparent to even the least
perspicacious onlooker

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:51.917
CAMEROON

01:07:51.958 --> 01:07:54.250
GRENADA

01:07:54.292 --> 01:07:56.042
DOMINICA

01:07:54.708 --> 01:07:59.958
that they have prostituted themselves
for a few yen.

01:08:02.375 --> 01:08:06.875
The Japanese government
pays our fees, our annual fees,

01:08:03.542 --> 01:08:08.458
ATHERTON MARTIN
Former IWC Representative for Dominica

01:08:06.958 --> 01:08:10.125
for participation in the International
Whaling Commission.

01:08:10.208 --> 01:08:12.417
It has nothing to do with nutrition.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:15.042
It simply has to do with the fact
that "You voted for us,

01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:17.542
"so let's give you something
that you people can see

01:08:17.625 --> 01:08:20.000
"that it was worth your while
to sell your vote to us--

01:08:20.042 --> 01:08:21.292
fisheries complexes."

01:08:24.542 --> 01:08:28.207
Interestingly,
the fisheries complexes built by Japan

01:08:24.792 --> 01:08:26.457
ANTIGUA

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:27.750
ST. KITTS

01:08:27.832 --> 01:08:30.625
DOMINICA

01:08:28.292 --> 01:08:29.792
have already gone into disuse

01:08:29.832 --> 01:08:33.457
because it has nothing to do with fishing.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.292
One neighbor got the goodies,

01:08:35.375 --> 01:08:38.250
and every other neighbor
wants a part of the goodies.

01:08:38.332 --> 01:08:40.582
Every island
in the Eastern Caribbean--

01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:42.792
St. Kitts, Antigua,
St. Vincent., St. Lucia,

01:08:42.875 --> 01:08:44.167
Grenada, Dominica--

01:08:44.207 --> 01:08:46.000
we all have the same goodies.

01:08:47.167 --> 01:08:50.750
In Dominica, we have a $22 million
fisheries complex

01:08:50.832 --> 01:08:54.625
which is used for the local merchants
to store imported chicken.

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:01.417
It's very sad to see the beautiful
islands in the Caribbean

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:06.082
becoming neon-lit whorehouses
for the Japanese.

01:09:07.375 --> 01:09:09.582
It really runs counter to logic

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:10.957
why the Japanese continue

01:09:11.042 --> 01:09:14.542
to keep this dying
whaling business going,

01:09:14.625 --> 01:09:16.542
especially when you get the facts

01:09:16.625 --> 01:09:18.042
about the levels of mercury

01:09:18.125 --> 01:09:20.125
and other contaminants
in the meat.

01:09:20.207 --> 01:09:22.667
I visited Japan earlier this year,

01:09:22.707 --> 01:09:26.042
and I discovered that there
was another peculiar reason

01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:28.542
for the Japanese position
at the IWC.

01:09:28.625 --> 01:09:31.832
This has not got to do
with economics.

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:34.417
it hasn't even got to do with politics.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.167
It really has to do with the--

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:41.542
the remnants
of a traditional notion of empire.

01:09:41.625 --> 01:09:44.167
They had had enough of the West

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:47.082
telling them what to do
and how to do it and when to do it.

01:09:47.167 --> 01:09:49.500
"Well, you're not going to make us
stop killing whales. "

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:54.792
There's some kind of misplaced
nationalistic pride at work.

01:09:54.875 --> 01:09:57.167
It's an industry that is
massively subsidized

01:09:57.208 --> 01:09:58.458
by Japanese taxpayers,

01:09:58.542 --> 01:10:00.417
and when you have those sorts
of subsidies in place,

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.208
you invite corruption.

01:10:02.292 --> 01:10:06.583
In order to perpetuate
this cultural argument,

01:10:06.667 --> 01:10:08.583
the Taiji dolphin hunters

01:10:08.667 --> 01:10:11.917
started giving
the dolphin meat away free

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.667
to the school system.

01:10:13.708 --> 01:10:16.083
They're getting this
in a form of propaganda.

01:10:16.167 --> 01:10:17.500
They're not being told

01:10:17.542 --> 01:10:19.958
that the free lunchmeat
that their children are getting

01:10:20.042 --> 01:10:23.292
are contaminated
with high levels of mercury.

01:10:23.375 --> 01:10:25.750
Are you aware
of the Mayor of Taiji's plan

01:10:25.833 --> 01:10:27.375
to distribute dolphin meat
throughout Japan

01:10:27.458 --> 01:10:28.958
to Japanese children?

01:10:30.292 --> 01:10:33.583
I think you...
correctly misunderstood.

01:10:33.667 --> 01:10:34.750
Did l?

01:10:34.833 --> 01:10:37.958
You perfectly misunderstood.

01:10:37.583 --> 01:10:38.833
TAIJI TOWN COUNCILMEN

01:10:38.833 --> 01:10:43.583
The town mayor wants to introduce
whales and dolphins harvested in Taiji

01:10:43.583 --> 01:10:49.750
to school lunch all over the country.

01:10:50.875 --> 01:10:53.708
Two city council members
came out on record.

01:10:53.792 --> 01:10:55.417
They risked their--

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.458
if not their lives,
their livelihood to speak out.

01:10:57.583 --> 01:11:01.458
I have two sons, one is 7 years old,
and the other is 5 years old.

01:11:01.833 --> 01:11:04.333
School lunch is compulsory.

01:11:04.667 --> 01:11:08.042
They must eat everything.

01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:11.875
If dolphin meat is used for school lunch,

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.125
it brings about terrible results.

01:11:21.042 --> 01:11:22.833
There's a saying in Japan

01:11:22.917 --> 01:11:26.458
that says the nail that sticks out
must be pounded down,

01:11:26.542 --> 01:11:27.833
and so it's a real problem

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:31.000
just to stand up
and be counted in Japan.

01:11:32.208 --> 01:11:36.458
There's no environmental movement
working actively on this issue

01:11:36.542 --> 01:11:40.167
that has any kind
of power at all in that country.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:42.500
We are dumping in the environment

01:11:42.583 --> 01:11:46.875
all kinds of chemicals
like mercury, cadmium, lead.

01:11:46.958 --> 01:11:48.375
We have the obligation--

01:11:48.417 --> 01:11:51.375
We have a moral authority
to do something about it.

01:11:51.458 --> 01:11:52.542
In a few years,

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:54.417
we may look back
and wonder what we did,

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:58.417
allowing more and more tons
of meat to be consumed.

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.250
We have a moral obligation,

01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:03.083
and let it not be said
that you didn't know about it.

01:12:03.167 --> 01:12:04.417
You know about it.

01:12:05.875 --> 01:12:10.167
To me, you're either an activist
or an inactivist,

01:12:10.208 --> 01:12:11.917
and I wanted to be active.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.917
I wanted to stop this.

01:12:38.583 --> 01:12:42.458
MISSION 2
FULL ORCHESTRA

01:12:52.208 --> 01:12:53.750
I recognize it. Do you?

01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:56.167
8335. Yeah, I do recognize it.

01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:58.792
I think it was the double
channels. Yep.

01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:01.958
Can you go straight?

01:13:03.333 --> 01:13:05.083
They're doing a circle.

01:13:05.167 --> 01:13:06.583
Let's take a quick break.

01:13:06.667 --> 01:13:07.625
Quick, quick, quick, quick.

01:13:07.708 --> 01:13:11.292
- It's 766. It's the cop.
- Is it?

01:13:10.833 --> 01:13:12.500
How many cars do they have on us?

01:13:12.583 --> 01:13:13.958
Did they see us stop?

01:13:14.292 --> 01:13:16.417
Ric, do you - are they on you?
Can you see them?

01:13:16.542 --> 01:13:18.458
Yes they're behind me.
Good luck.

01:13:19.833 --> 01:13:21.375
Coming up on the drop zone.

01:13:21.792 --> 01:13:23.833
Two, one, two, check.

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:25.417
Let's go, let's go.

01:13:34.667 --> 01:13:37.083
Louie we're on the path
waiting for you to survey the area.

01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:40.250
I don't see anybody on the path.

01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:49.458
Mandy you're good to go.

01:13:50.875 --> 01:13:52.125
We are over the first gate.

01:13:53.208 --> 01:13:55.292
We're heading towards the inner fence.

01:13:55.667 --> 01:13:57.667
Don't come in until I tell you to.

01:13:59.250 --> 01:13:59.875
Copy that.

01:14:03.625 --> 01:14:05.792
Looks clear on this side so far.

01:14:10.042 --> 01:14:10.625
Okay.

01:14:10.708 --> 01:14:12.417
Moving to the first setup.

01:14:17.917 --> 01:14:19.458
How are Kirk and Mandy doing?

01:14:20.917 --> 01:14:22.875
Mandy and Kirk are in the water.

01:14:25.958 --> 01:14:27.208
How's Simon doing?

01:14:29.042 --> 01:14:30.125
He's good, one is rolling.

01:14:31.083 --> 01:14:33.167
Okay, I'll find a place to put one on my side.

01:14:37.458 --> 01:14:38.708
You all good, Louie?

01:14:40.083 --> 01:14:41.208
I hate heights.

01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:43.542
Sounds like it's in a good spot.

01:14:45.625 --> 01:14:47.417
Underwater camera is set.

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:50.833
Guys, wait right there.

01:14:53.417 --> 01:14:55.458
Louie, Louie, are you there?

01:14:55.708 --> 01:14:56.958
I see something up in the hills.

01:14:59.083 --> 01:15:00.042
Shit.

01:15:00.542 --> 01:15:01.792
Abort, abort.

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:03.458
Keep low, keep low.

01:15:07.458 --> 01:15:08.667
I think it was a marmot.

01:15:08.958 --> 01:15:09.833
Very  cool.

01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:13.375
Okay, I'm  moving to the beach setup.

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:19.500
Little creepy back here.
You can definitely feel what goes on here.

01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:23.833
You have more time if you need it.

01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:29.042
We are all good.
Just setting off the last camera.

01:15:31.125 --> 01:15:33.708
All cameras in position and good to go.

01:15:43.708 --> 01:15:45.375
Yeah, that's cool.

01:15:54.958 --> 01:15:56.292
Set it down.

01:16:01.375 --> 01:16:03.500
In Midway, Hawaii, you know Midway, Hawaii.

01:16:03.542 --> 01:16:05.500
I saw sperm whales from horizon to horizon.

01:16:05.542 --> 01:16:07.000
Just like the dolphins.

01:16:08.958 --> 01:16:11.000
There was a time when sperm whales
were
as plentiful as dolphins.

01:16:11.042 --> 01:16:16.000
When I was in Chile, I saw
blue whales from horizon to horizon.

01:16:16.542 --> 01:16:19.750
It was like a clump of bamboo.
That's what we called it "clump of bamboo".

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:28.250
Wherever you looked, the ocean was truly black,
it was covered with blue whales, my arms were exhausted.

01:16:28.708 --> 01:16:30.667
Blue whales?
Yes.

01:16:30.875 --> 01:16:33.208
When I went to Chile in South America,
it's a mecca.

01:16:33.625 --> 01:16:37.542
I have experience killing dolphins but...
They are different from dolphins. They are huge.

01:20:30.875 --> 01:20:36.375
There was kind of a collective horror
when we started to see the footage.

01:20:36.458 --> 01:20:38.500
It was mind-boggling.

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:43.333
They're doing it exactly

01:20:43.375 --> 01:20:44.917
Iike they did with the large whales.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.625
they're slaughtering
every one they can get.

01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:39.542
Why didn't they set them free?

01:21:44.417 --> 01:21:48.708
That question has kept me
awake for a long time.

01:21:58.083 --> 01:21:59.792
I've watched them give birth.

01:21:59.875 --> 01:22:03.833
I've nursed them back to health
when they're sick.

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.917
Had I known what I know now,

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.417
I would have raised enough money

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.250
to buy them away
from the Seaquarium

01:22:11.333 --> 01:22:12.542
and set them free.

01:22:12.583 --> 01:22:15.083
That would have been
the right thing to do.

01:22:15.167 --> 01:22:18.833
I was buying
a new Porsche every year.

01:22:18.875 --> 01:22:24.583
But I was as ignorant as I could be
for as long as I could be.

01:22:24.667 --> 01:22:28.458
I didn't think about that
for a long time later.

01:22:34.917 --> 01:22:36.125
Listen to me.

01:22:36.208 --> 01:22:39.375
Our killing method
has been improved substantially,

01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:41.542
and the fishermen in Taiji

01:22:41.625 --> 01:22:43.833
are using specific-made knife

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:47.167
and put the-- do that--
to the spine,

01:22:47.208 --> 01:22:50.083
and then most of the animals
are killed instantly.

01:22:50.167 --> 01:22:52.292
- Killed instantly?
- Yes.

01:22:52.375 --> 01:22:55.292
And if they were killed
other than this method,

01:22:55.375 --> 01:22:56.708
would that be cruel?

01:22:59.708 --> 01:23:02.917
As I told you, I don't want to talk
about "if" stories.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.208
I want to show you
some video that I just saw.

01:23:31.250 --> 01:23:33.708
When and where did you take this?

01:23:41.625 --> 01:23:43.750
All whaling countries...

01:23:44.125 --> 01:23:46.083
have proven that

01:23:46.125 --> 01:23:49.208
they have improved the
killing method and time to death.

01:23:52.250 --> 01:23:59.958
And in my country for example, the time to death
has been shortened year after year

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:06.000
and now more than half the animals
are killed instantaneously

01:24:06.958 --> 01:24:09.750
and we are proud of that data,
and the improvement.

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:06.708
I have to see this end in my lifetime.

01:25:08.958 --> 01:25:12.958
Right now I'm focusing
on that one little body of water

01:25:13.042 --> 01:25:16.083
where that slaughter takes place.

01:25:16.167 --> 01:25:19.875
If we can't stop that,
if we can't fix that,

01:25:19.917 --> 01:25:22.583
forget about the bigger issues.

01:25:24.125 --> 01:25:25.458
There's no hope.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:25.375
Everyone there,
show us your passport.

01:30:25.417 --> 01:30:27.458
Hey. How are you?

01:30:27.542 --> 01:30:29.125
Nice to see you.

01:30:42.083 --> 01:30:45.208
So we went for--
for the children, you see.
