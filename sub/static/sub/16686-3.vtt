00:04.305 --> 00:07.339
<i>alcohol is terrible,</i>

00:07.341 --> 00:09.608

and today,
we're gonna talk about

01:30.491 --> 01:33.459
the saloon smasher.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.694
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:35.696 --> 01:39.498
<i>- [hiccups]</i>
<i>Our story starts in Kansas!</i>

01:39.500 --> 01:42.534
<i>Carrie Nation married a man,</i>

01:42.536 --> 01:47.239
but he dies of alcoholism.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.241
So, in 1900,

01:49.243 --> 01:52.544
<i>she prayed for God</i>
<i>to tell her what to do.</i>

01:52.546 --> 01:55.547
<i>Jesus, let me know</i>
<i>what I can do</i>

01:55.549 --> 02:00.185
<i>to stop people from drinking.</i>

02:00.187 --> 02:01.854
<i>God said to her,</i>

02:01.856 --> 02:04.223
<i>Go to Kiowa, Kansas--</i>

02:04.225 --> 02:05.657
<i>not Iowa, Carrie--</i>

02:05.659 --> 02:08.227
<i>and I will stand with you.</i>

02:08.229 --> 02:09.194
<i>And she did.</i>

02:09.196 --> 02:11.296
<i>So, she goes to Kiowa, Kansas.</i>

02:11.298 --> 02:14.433
<i>She brings, like,</i>
<i>bricks and rocks</i>

02:14.435 --> 02:15.934
<i>to smash up bars.</i>

02:15.936 --> 02:18.203
And that's when the real
[bleep] went down.

02:18.205 --> 02:20.439
<i>She was like, I don't want</i>
<i>to strike you, barkeep,</i>

02:20.441 --> 02:23.742
<i>but I will break up</i>
<i>this den of vice.</i>

02:23.744 --> 02:26.945
<i>So, the barkeep was like--</i>
<i>- "This den of vice"?</i>

02:26.947 --> 02:29.281
<i>- "This den of vice."</i>

02:29.283 --> 02:30.349
<i>The barkeep was like, That--</i>

02:30.351 --> 02:32.351
<i>this has never happened,</i>

02:32.353 --> 02:34.653
<i>so I don't know</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

02:34.655 --> 02:36.622
[slurping]

02:36.624 --> 02:37.489
Sorry, that was loud.

02:37.491 --> 02:41.493
<i>You don't know [bleep],</i>
<i>because my husband</i>

02:41.495 --> 02:44.196
<i>[bleep] died of alcohol.</i>

02:44.198 --> 02:47.366
<i>P.S., I super hate alcohol.</i>

02:47.368 --> 02:51.336
<i>So...um,</i>
<i>she smashes this bar up,</i>

02:51.338 --> 02:53.839
and this is the first time
anyone has ever

02:53.841 --> 02:56.275
[bleep] freaked out
like a crazy person.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.843
<i>She smashes up</i>
<i>all that [bleep].</i>

02:57.845 --> 02:59.912
She's smashing up, um,

02:59.914 --> 03:01.413
<i>all of his bottles of alcohol.</i>

03:01.415 --> 03:04.383
<i>Well, it's [bleep] illegal</i>
<i>for him to have it.</i>

03:04.385 --> 03:08.287
And smashing his fun.
[laughing]

03:08.289 --> 03:11.757
<i>She smashed everything.</i>

03:11.759 --> 03:13.525
<i>She comes out of his bar.</i>

03:13.527 --> 03:15.394
<i>There's a huge crowd,</i>

03:15.396 --> 03:18.263
<i>because people have never</i>
<i>seen anything like this.</i>

03:18.265 --> 03:19.965
<i>So everyone's out there going,</i>
<i>Yay!</i>

03:19.967 --> 03:21.533
<i>We like that that happened!</i>

03:21.535 --> 03:23.835
<i>And so she gains</i>
<i>a lot of supporters.</i>

03:23.837 --> 03:28.307
<i>At this point, it's illegal</i>
<i>to sell liquor in Kansas.</i>

03:28.309 --> 03:30.943
[chuckles]
Those assholes.

03:30.945 --> 03:31.543
- [laughs]

03:31.545 --> 03:34.379
<i>- So, Carrie goes</i>
<i>to three other bars,</i>

03:34.381 --> 03:37.950
<i>smashes their [bleep] up too.</i>

03:37.952 --> 03:40.352
<i>And then, finally,</i>
<i>the town marshal is like,</i>

03:40.354 --> 03:41.920
<i>Please stop.</i>

03:41.922 --> 03:45.324
<i>I'm going to have to</i>
<i>arrest you.</i>

03:45.326 --> 03:46.425
<i>She goes--she gets arrested.</i>

03:46.427 --> 03:49.428
<i>She is arrested</i>
<i>for seven weeks.</i>

03:49.430 --> 03:50.562
So, she gets out of jail.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.498
<i>Um, she goes to two other</i>
<i>cities in Kansas.</i>

03:53.500 --> 03:55.801
<i>When she gets to Wichita,</i>
<i>she says,</i>

03:55.803 --> 04:00.505
<i>Men of Wichita:</i>
<i>this is the right arm of God,</i>

04:00.507 --> 04:04.276
<i>and I am destined to destroy</i>

04:04.278 --> 04:06.311
<i>every saloon in your city.</i>

04:06.313 --> 04:07.579
<i>She goes into</i>
<i>the Carey hotel bar.</i>

04:07.581 --> 04:12.050
<i>She smashes up</i>
<i>every bottle of alcohol.</i>

04:12.052 --> 04:14.453
<i>She smashes up every mirror,</i>
<i>every window.</i>

04:14.455 --> 04:16.922
<i>She smashes it good,</i>

04:16.924 --> 04:18.857
because Jesus told her to smash,

04:18.859 --> 04:20.959
and when Jesus say, "Smash,"
she smash.

04:20.961 --> 04:24.663
<i>She does $3,000</i>
<i>worth of damage.</i>

04:24.665 --> 04:26.932
Now, during
one of her smashies--

04:26.934 --> 04:28.934
- Oh, I like the smashies.
- [laughing]

04:28.936 --> 04:30.736
I wanted her to call it
"Smashies."

04:30.738 --> 04:33.572
I don't know that she did.
- [laughing]

04:33.574 --> 04:36.642
- A fan of hers
gives her a hatchet.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.343
<i>Carrie is like,</i>
<i>Enough with the bricks.</i>

04:38.345 --> 04:40.545
<i>Let's get to the real [bleep],</i>
<i>a hatchet.</i>

04:40.547 --> 04:42.514
<i>So she goes into this bar,</i>

04:42.516 --> 04:46.084
<i>gets into the bar,</i>
<i>and smashes up</i>

04:46.086 --> 04:49.388
<i>every bottle of alcohol.</i>

04:49.390 --> 04:50.622
Every...
[laughing]

04:50.624 --> 04:53.358
Ev-er-y. Ev-er-y.
So--

04:53.360 --> 04:54.893
- Everly Cleary?
- Every.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.896
Is what you should say.
But I'm saying "Ev-er-y."

04:57.898 --> 04:58.630
That's weird.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.500
<i>So, she smashes up everything</i>
<i>in the bar.</i>

05:01.502 --> 05:04.670
<i>And she leaves the bar.</i>

05:04.672 --> 05:07.039
<i>And she's out talking to</i>

05:07.041 --> 05:10.075
<i>this huge mass of people,</i>
<i>and it's like,</i>

05:10.077 --> 05:12.544
<i>Alcohol is terrible.</i>
<i>Don't drink.</i>

05:12.546 --> 05:15.614
<i>Everyone is like, Whoo,</i>
<i>we're eating this [bleep] up.</i>

05:15.616 --> 05:17.649
<i>So, she's famous.</i>

05:17.651 --> 05:19.384
<i>Now she is famous.</i>

05:19.386 --> 05:21.119
<i>So, she goes around</i>

05:21.121 --> 05:23.488
<i>the whole United States</i>
<i>of America.</i>

05:23.490 --> 05:26.058
<i>She tours.</i>
<i>She smashes up bars.</i>

05:26.060 --> 05:29.394
<i>And she never stops,</i>
<i>and a lot of people</i>

05:29.396 --> 05:31.530
<i>try to write her off</i>
<i>as a crazy lady</i>

05:31.532 --> 05:34.866
<i>because she's the only</i>
<i>person saying,</i>

05:34.868 --> 05:38.737
<i>Hey, maybe alcohol is terrible.</i>

05:38.739 --> 05:40.505
But she be wrong, though, 'cause

05:40.507 --> 05:44.109
this [bleep] is delicious.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.544
[slurping]

05:45.546 --> 05:49.581
So, she died in 1911.

05:49.583 --> 05:53.618
And prohibition
was passed in 1919,

05:53.620 --> 05:57.422
due in large part to her
and her efforts.

05:57.424 --> 05:59.491
But also, women's rights.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.993
<i>That was Carrie A.</i>
<i>[bleep] Nation.</i>

06:01.995 --> 06:04.029
<i>Because she always advocated</i>

06:04.031 --> 06:05.564
<i>for women's right to vote.</i>

06:05.566 --> 06:08.500
<i>Thank you for [bleep]</i>
<i>letting me [bleep] vote.</i>

06:08.502 --> 06:10.669
Lady.
- Amen.

06:10.671 --> 06:12.571
- Glad you smashed up
these bars.

06:12.573 --> 06:13.972
- Yeah.

06:13.974 --> 06:18.944
- Bet it was cool.
I sure like voting.

06:18.946 --> 06:21.113
[slurping]

06:21.115 --> 06:23.515
- [bubbling] I've always
been able to vote.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.518
- [laughing]

06:26.520 --> 06:30.021
I'm black--I haven't been able
to vote twice.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.457
[laughter]

06:34.026 --> 06:37.963
In the name of Carrie A. Nation.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.699
- Let's smash this [bleep].
- Let's smash.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.668
- One, two, three.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.570
[glass shattering]

06:47.006 --> 06:49.441
- To you, Carrie A. Nation.

06:49.443 --> 06:52.511
<i>- The original Smash Mouth.</i>

06:56.816 --> 06:58.850
- All right, so we'll start--

06:58.852 --> 06:59.751
you look into Tommy's camera.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.888
- Shut up right now.
Shut up right now.

07:02.890 --> 07:03.889
- Do it your own way.
- Shut up.

07:03.891 --> 07:07.125
Shut the [bleep] up.
- Know that I mean--

07:07.127 --> 07:10.262
- Shut the [bleep] up.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.699
Hello.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.701
I'm Kyle Kinane.

07:16.703 --> 07:19.304
And today, we're gonna talk

07:19.306 --> 07:22.207
about Andrew Jackson.

07:22.209 --> 07:25.177
The brawler.

07:25.745 --> 07:28.713
<i>Start early 1800s.</i>

07:28.715 --> 07:29.214
<i>America.</i>

07:29.216 --> 07:31.650
<i>Andrew Jackson's army,</i>
<i>they're in Tennessee.</i>

07:31.652 --> 07:34.186
<i>He's a--</i>
<i>an accomplished duelist.</i>

07:34.188 --> 07:36.321
<i>Jackson's like,</i>
<i>I've been a soldier</i>

07:36.323 --> 07:37.823
<i>and a brawler my whole time.</i>

07:37.825 --> 07:41.359
<i>I'm a badass dude.</i>

07:41.361 --> 07:42.861
So, there's a couple brothers

07:42.863 --> 07:43.895
named Thomas and Jesse Benton.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.998
<i>They're officers</i>
<i>in Andrew Jackson's army.</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:49.835
<i>These two brothers, they're</i>
<i>a couple rabble rousers.</i>

07:49.837 --> 07:50.802
<i>Couple troublemakers.</i>

07:50.804 --> 07:53.672
<i>Thomas, he's power-hungry.</i>
<i>He wants to make it.</i>

07:53.674 --> 07:54.806
<i>He just wants--</i>
<i>he--he wants--</i>

07:54.808 --> 07:57.342
he wants--
he wants it.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.878
Becomes Jackson's
right-hand man.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.980
<i>Jackson likes him so much,</i>

08:01.982 --> 08:02.914
<i>he sends him to D.C.</i>

08:02.916 --> 08:06.885
<i>Jesse Benton, still in--</i>
<i>still in Tennessee.</i>

08:06.887 --> 08:09.955
<i>Part of the regiment, gets into</i>
<i>an argument with another--</i>

08:09.957 --> 08:12.123
<i>another fellow</i>
<i>under Jackson's regime</i>

08:12.125 --> 08:15.026
<i>by the name of,</i>
<i>uh, William Carroll.</i>

08:15.028 --> 08:16.061
Some old-timey argument.

08:16.063 --> 08:19.664
<i>Jabber, jabber, jabber?</i>
<i>Jabber, jabber, jabber.</i>

08:19.666 --> 08:20.832
<i>No end result.</i>

08:20.834 --> 08:23.101
<i>Well, we're not gonna</i>
<i>settle this with words.</i>

08:23.103 --> 08:26.304
<i>All right, let's meet in a</i>
<i>field and shoot at each other.</i>

08:26.306 --> 08:27.372
<i>Duel!</i>

08:27.374 --> 08:28.907
- [laughing]
- So...

08:28.909 --> 08:30.809
It's--it's very inefficient.

08:30.811 --> 08:31.810
It's very inefficient.

08:31.812 --> 08:35.013
So, William Carroll
knew he was experienced.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.882
<i>He's like, So listen, Andy,</i>
<i>do me a solid--</i>

08:36.884 --> 08:37.916
<i>I'm working under you.</i>

08:37.918 --> 08:41.019
<i>Can you be on</i>
<i>the ones and twos for me?</i>

08:41.021 --> 08:43.889
<i>Andrew Dacks--</i>
<i>Andrew Jackson says,</i>

08:43.891 --> 08:45.891
<i>You know what?</i>

08:45.893 --> 08:48.026
<i>I'm your second.</i>
<i>Let's go at it.</i>

08:48.028 --> 08:49.394
<i>[claps]</i>
<i>Duel!</i>

08:49.396 --> 08:51.863
<i>So, the duel goes down.</i>

08:51.865 --> 08:52.931
<i>Ten-pace duel.</i>

08:52.933 --> 08:55.000
<i>Turn, spin, shoot.</i>
<i>Poom!</i>

08:55.002 --> 08:58.470
<i>Carroll gets</i>
<i>his thumb blown off,</i>

08:58.472 --> 08:59.804
<i>still gets one off,</i>

08:59.806 --> 09:01.773
<i>shoots Jesse Benton</i>
<i>in his ass.</i>

09:01.775 --> 09:04.442
<i>Hilarious shot.</i>

09:04.444 --> 09:07.712
[laughter]

09:09.749 --> 09:10.849
People are out there going
nut--they're--

09:10.851 --> 09:12.951
<i>they're like, Well, did you</i>
<i>hear about the duel?</i>

09:12.953 --> 09:16.288
<i>Jesse Benton's got</i>
<i>an extra asshole.</i>

09:16.290 --> 09:18.790
<i>[laughing]</i>

09:22.461 --> 09:23.728

09:23.730 --> 09:27.065

Get them giggles out.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.334
Ooh, yeah!

09:29.336 --> 09:31.036
<i>It--the word gets</i>

09:43.450 --> 09:47.185
Now, Thomas Benton, Andrew
Jackson's aide, is furious.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.888

- Hello, I'm Crissle West,
and today,

14:47.320 --> 14:51.589
we're going to discuss
Marsha P. Johnson.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.324
<i>So, the story begins</i>

14:53.326 --> 14:56.194
<i>in the middle of</i>
<i>New York City,</i>

14:56.196 --> 14:59.464
<i>in the Village,</i>
<i>on Christopher Street,</i>

14:59.466 --> 15:00.899
<i>and back then, you know,</i>

15:00.901 --> 15:03.434
<i>New York had a growing</i>
<i>LGBT population.</i>

15:03.436 --> 15:08.172
<i>So, basically,</i>
<i>the non-straight population</i>

15:08.174 --> 15:10.241
<i>had a bunch of bars and stuff</i>

15:10.243 --> 15:12.243
<i>in Greenwich Village,</i>
<i>and so,</i>

15:12.245 --> 15:14.946
you know, all the queer kids
would go down

15:14.948 --> 15:15.847
to the Village and be like,

15:15.849 --> 15:18.483
<i>We're here to be ourselves.</i>

15:18.485 --> 15:21.719
But these people didn't have
a sense of community.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.521
<i>Like, this was a point in time</i>

15:23.523 --> 15:25.890
<i>where you came out</i>
<i>as being trans,</i>

15:25.892 --> 15:27.458
<i>and you were just</i>
<i>kicked out of the house.</i>

15:27.460 --> 15:28.660
<i>Like, and nobody gave</i>
<i>a [bleep] about you.</i>

15:28.662 --> 15:30.762
<i>And that was kind of</i>
<i>what happened to Marsha.</i>

15:30.764 --> 15:34.499
Like, she was a queer person
growing up in Jersey.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.802
<i>Okay, so she would</i>
<i>get on the train in Jersey,</i>

15:37.804 --> 15:40.371
<i>um, dressed as Malcolm,</i>
<i>which was her birth name,</i>

15:40.373 --> 15:44.242
<i>and then on the way over</i>
<i>from Jersey to New York,</i>

15:44.244 --> 15:45.310
<i>transform into Marsha</i>
<i>with, you know,</i>

15:45.312 --> 15:48.613
<i>beer cans and pop cans,</i>
<i>uh, for rollers.</i>

15:48.615 --> 15:51.215
<i>Just like,</i>
<i>I'm Marsha P. Johnson, bitch,</i>

15:51.217 --> 15:52.884
<i>and if you don't like it,</i>
<i>you go to hell.</i>

15:52.886 --> 15:55.653
<i>Like, here I am, ho.</i>
<i>What you gonna do?</i>

15:55.655 --> 15:57.655
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
- [laughing]

15:57.657 --> 15:59.791
- You have the best
laugh in the world.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.392
I love it.
<i>- Oh, God!</i>

16:01.394 --> 16:02.860
<i>Whoo! Anyways.</i>
- Yeah.

16:02.862 --> 16:05.630
- The 1960s is a very
tumultuous time

16:05.632 --> 16:08.299
for the United States
of America.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.436
Because every minority group
imaginable

16:11.438 --> 16:12.370
<i>is tired of the status quo.</i>

16:12.372 --> 16:15.707
<i>Okay, so there was a group</i>
<i>of officers</i>

16:15.709 --> 16:18.743
<i>in New York City</i>
<i>called the Public Moral Squad,</i>

16:18.745 --> 16:20.578
which is ridiculous,
because when in the [bleep]

16:20.580 --> 16:22.814
have morals been a part
of this God damn city?

16:22.816 --> 16:26.417
Like, the city's trash,
and the Public Moral Squad

16:26.419 --> 16:27.585
<i>took their orders</i>
<i>directly from the mayor.</i>

16:27.587 --> 16:30.488
<i>The mayor was like,</i>
<i>I want you to go shut down</i>

16:30.490 --> 16:32.690
<i>the [bleep] gay bars.</i>

16:32.692 --> 16:34.525
<i>I'm sick of them mother[bleep]</i>

16:34.527 --> 16:36.828
<i>putting they [bleep]</i>
<i>on people's asses,</i>

16:36.830 --> 16:40.398
<i>and it's time to be over.</i>

16:41.500 --> 16:44.836
<i>So, the night at Stonewall,</i>
<i>June 18th--</i>

16:44.838 --> 16:47.538
<i>or 28th.</i>
<i>June 28th.</i>

16:47.540 --> 16:49.474
I know it was one of the 8s.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.442
[laughter]

16:51.444 --> 16:52.543
Oh, God.

16:52.545 --> 16:55.346
<i>So, that night,</i>

16:55.348 --> 16:57.982
<i>Charles Smythe and</i>
<i>Seymour Pine,</i>

16:57.984 --> 17:01.352
<i>they walked into the</i>
<i>Stonewall Inn, and they said,</i>

17:01.354 --> 17:02.453
<i>Hey, bitch!</i>

17:02.455 --> 17:04.288
<i>[clapping]</i>
<i>We here!</i>

17:04.290 --> 17:06.991
<i>And [bleep] is under</i>
<i>mother[bleep] arrest.</i>

17:06.993 --> 17:08.960
<i>Sit your gay ass down,</i>

17:08.962 --> 17:09.627
<i>and wait for us to</i>

17:09.629 --> 17:11.929
<i>verify your mother[bleep] I.D.</i>

17:11.931 --> 17:14.866
<i>with your [bleep]</i>
<i>mother[bleep] genitals!</i>

17:14.868 --> 17:16.034
<i>[crashing]</i>

17:16.036 --> 17:18.302
[laughing]

17:18.304 --> 17:19.370
Sorry, tree.

17:19.372 --> 17:19.837
[laughter]

17:19.839 --> 17:21.606
<i>And the trans girls was like,</i>
<i>Oh, no, bitch.</i>

17:21.608 --> 17:23.441
<i>We didn't ask for this.</i>

17:23.443 --> 17:24.876
<i>And some people were, like,</i>
<i>freaking out,</i>

17:24.878 --> 17:26.444
<i>and trying to, like,</i>
<i>go for the exits,</i>

17:26.446 --> 17:29.447
<i>but the police had barricaded</i>
<i>the whole thing.</i>

17:29.449 --> 17:31.315
<i>And Marsha says,</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

17:31.317 --> 17:34.952
Today is not
the mother[bleep] day!

17:34.954 --> 17:37.522
<i>Today is the day that I say no</i>
<i>to this bull[bleep].</i>

17:37.524 --> 17:41.626
<i>Like, y'all are not going</i>
<i>to continue</i>

17:41.628 --> 17:44.028
<i>to run us, to dictate</i>

17:44.030 --> 17:45.797
<i>what our lives should be like.</i>

17:45.799 --> 17:48.633
T-t-to dish--to dic-trate

17:48.635 --> 17:50.635
<i>what our lives</i>
<i>are supposed to be like.</i>

17:50.637 --> 17:53.638
<i>You're not in charge</i>
<i>any [bleep] more.</i>

17:53.640 --> 17:57.075
<i>We're here, and as long as we</i>
<i>have to pay taxes,</i>

17:57.077 --> 17:58.543
<i>you're gonna have to listen to</i>
<i>what the [bleep]</i>

17:58.545 --> 18:01.646
<i>that we have to shay--</i>
<i>we have to sh--</i>

18:01.648 --> 18:02.647
<i>to shay.</i>

18:02.649 --> 18:03.681
<i>To say!</i>

18:03.683 --> 18:07.018
So Marsha P. Johnson
stood the [bleep] up,

18:07.020 --> 18:09.053
<i>and she picked up</i>
<i>a shot glass,</i>

18:09.055 --> 18:11.789
<i>and she smashed that [bleep]</i>
<i>against the mirror and said,</i>

18:11.791 --> 18:13.925
<i>I got my civil rights!</i>

18:13.927 --> 18:17.028
She had had enough that
mother[bleep] day.

18:17.030 --> 18:20.364
<i>So, during the Stonewall riots,</i>
<i>that first night,</i>

18:20.366 --> 18:22.500
all these members
of the gay community

18:22.502 --> 18:23.668
started gathering outside.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.636
<i>Marsha, she's thinking, like,</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

18:25.638 --> 18:26.938
<i>There's so many of, like, us.</i>

18:26.940 --> 18:30.074
<i>There's 500 of this--</i>

18:30.076 --> 18:30.741
<i>of us.</i>

18:30.743 --> 18:33.411
By the time backup showed up
to Christopher Street,

18:33.413 --> 18:34.045
it was way too late.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.680
<i>Some of the rioters</i>
<i>threw rocks and [bleep].</i>

18:35.682 --> 18:37.682
<i>Others found bricks and</i>
<i>[bleep], and they're like,</i>

18:37.684 --> 18:41.486
<i>We're gonna [bleep] it up</i>
<i>by any means necessary.</i>

18:50.462 --> 18:53.030
- [laughing]

18:53.032 --> 18:54.198
Oh, God.
- It was good.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.068
- I told myself I was not
gonna get drunk this time.

18:57.070 --> 18:58.703
I don't know how I thought
that was gonna work.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.605
[laughter]

19:00.607 --> 19:01.005
Okay.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.541
So, the people
at Stonewall that night

19:03.543 --> 19:05.476
realized there's
a community of us.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.646
<i>It's not just 20 of us</i>
<i>on [bleep] Wednesday night</i>

19:08.648 --> 19:10.815
<i>when it's half off--</i>
<i>there's a whole group of us</i>

19:10.817 --> 19:13.184
<i>who are here</i>
<i>in this gay [bleep]</i>

19:13.186 --> 19:14.185
<i>and you're not</i>
<i>going to erase us</i>

19:14.187 --> 19:17.955
<i>from the mother[bleep]</i>
<i>conversation no more.</i>

19:17.957 --> 19:19.724
<i>So, Marsha says, Ultimately,</i>

19:19.726 --> 19:21.692
<i>humanness wins.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

19:21.694 --> 19:25.163
<i>- Ultimately, people win.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

19:25.165 --> 19:27.198
- That night,
and then the next one,

19:27.200 --> 19:29.100
constitute the Stonewall Riots,

19:29.102 --> 19:31.769
and that is what got the whole

19:31.771 --> 19:33.704
<i>gay rights movement in America</i>

19:33.706 --> 19:36.140
<i>started off.</i>

19:36.142 --> 19:37.241
<i>- Like, that gives me chills.</i>

19:37.243 --> 19:40.978
<i>- It's the shot glass heard</i>
<i>around the world.</i>

19:40.980 --> 19:42.847
<i>A few weeks later,</i>

19:42.849 --> 19:45.049
<i>Marsha and her friend Sylvia</i>

19:45.051 --> 19:47.218
<i>formed the Street Transvestite</i>

19:47.220 --> 19:48.853
<i>Act--Reaction Evolution.</i>

19:48.855 --> 19:51.689
<i>Which is not words we--</i>
<i>we would use to gay--</i>

19:51.691 --> 19:54.025
today, obviously,
it would be more like,

19:54.027 --> 19:55.860
Street Trans-vendor.

19:55.862 --> 19:56.794
Transgender, I mean.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.664
Not trans-vinegar, yeah, it's
not like that [bleep].

19:59.666 --> 20:02.567
<i>Basically, Marsha and Sylvia</i>

20:02.569 --> 20:03.868
<i>were out there in the '60s</i>

20:03.870 --> 20:05.570
<i>and '70s just trying to get</i>

20:05.572 --> 20:07.638
<i>these trans kids</i>
<i>a place to live.</i>

20:07.640 --> 20:09.106
She really was a badass.
- Yeah.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.809
- And so brave--like, I would
not have been that brave.

20:11.811 --> 20:12.877
In the '60s and '70s?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.679
I mean, it was bad enough
being black.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.846
- Right.
- But add in a queer identity,

20:15.848 --> 20:19.250
and then a--a queer gender
identity too?

20:19.252 --> 20:21.652
It was a lot.
It was a lot.

20:21.654 --> 20:22.653
And she still faced it.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.256
But truly?

20:25.258 --> 20:26.724
Black people deserve to be
on all this [bleep].

20:26.726 --> 20:28.726
- Mm-hmm.
- Black people and Sacagawea.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.562
Who needs to get off
the God damn coin

20:31.564 --> 20:33.764
and onto some [bleep]
paper money.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.032
[laughter]

20:35.034 --> 20:37.635
Because this our [bleep].
- Yeah.

20:37.637 --> 20:39.637
<i>Bow down.</i>

20:39.639 --> 20:41.806
<i>[patriotic music]</i>

20:41.808 --> 20:49.847
<i>♪ ♪</i>

21:08.100 --> 21:09.967
- Well, no, don't caress me.
- That's a Sublime song.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.702
- Don't test me
on Sublime songs.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.804
The song is called,
"Please Caress Me More."

21:13.806 --> 21:15.706
- Okay.
Sure.

21:15.708 --> 21:17.041
- That's--I don't want
to live it out.

21:17.043 --> 21:17.975
- [laughing]
- Don't live out--

21:17.977 --> 21:18.008
I don't want to live out Sublime
songs on my kitchen floor.
