00:00.201 --> 00:02.401
<i>Previously on
"The Night Shift"...</i>

00:02.403 --> 00:04.003
Norco was missing
from the Pixus.

00:04.005 --> 00:05.204
And you think Annie did it?

00:05.205 --> 00:06.404
I forgot my field jacket today,

00:06.407 --> 00:08.007
so I borrowed one
from T.C.'s locker.

00:08.009 --> 00:09.509
Are the rumors true?

00:09.510 --> 00:11.010
Are you guys really
gonna sell off this E.R.?

00:11.011 --> 00:12.511
If you have a résumé,
I would update it.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.179
My family buys hospitals.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.148
My dad is on a plane.
He'll be here in an hour.

00:16.149 --> 00:18.317
But you will have to
sell him on it.

00:18.319 --> 00:21.186
Mac, your left arm has what
we call pronator drift.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.622
It could be a symptom
of a brain abnormality.

00:23.624 --> 00:25.391
I wouldn't ask for a loan
if it wasn't important.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.558
I-I just can't lose
my business.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.559
Hey, Moss.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.228
I got your 5 grand.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.230
Brianna's birth father has
come back into the picture.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.731
He says he wants full custody.
Justin.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.199
Nice to meet you.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.601
You gave her your pills,
didn't you?

00:35.603 --> 00:37.603
I will be able to hold out
until the re-supply comes.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.204
Is this our medicine?

00:39.206 --> 00:40.472
How will get it now?

00:40.474 --> 00:42.074
Trail's cut off up ahead.

00:42.076 --> 00:43.208
We got get under
the fire shelters.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.278
It's coming right over us.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.348
Stay down, keep breathing!

00:49.350 --> 00:51.417
Is everyone okay?

00:52.653 --> 00:55.220
Scott! Jordan!

00:56.223 --> 00:58.524
Oh, my God, we made it.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.259
I told you we would.
Are you okay?

01:00.261 --> 01:03.462
No victory laps. The fire's close.
My leg is killing me.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.565
Ah!

01:06.567 --> 01:07.566
This leg is dusky.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.068
We got to release the pressure.

01:09.070 --> 01:10.636
She's going to lose her leg!
Not here.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.371
One of these embers could spark,
start a new fire.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.739
There's a shelter a mile ahead.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.108
Grab the gear, let's go.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.342
Come on, get off your asses!

01:17.344 --> 01:19.144
Whose idea was this?
His.

01:19.146 --> 01:20.512
Move!

01:20.514 --> 01:22.648
You're burning up.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.350
103, sensitivity to light.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.652
Your typhus is getting worse.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.387
It may alter
your mental status soon.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.322
What's your excuse, Callahan?

01:30.324 --> 01:31.857
That's funny, Syd.

01:31.859 --> 01:35.260
Look, we... we need the Cipro
we lost in the air drop.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.962
Okay?

01:36.963 --> 01:38.663
Hamdi and I are going to go
to the border to get it.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.266
You're kidding.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.867
T.C., those guards fired on
and gassed these people.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.435
They shoot first, ask later.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.603
This is a war zone.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.538
I speak Turkish, Dr.
Syd. That's great,

01:46.540 --> 01:48.674
then you'll understand them
when they tell you no.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.275
It's too risky.
Call the embassy.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.644
Syd, diplomatic channels
take too long.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.346
And what if
something happens, okay?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.681
There's 100 patients out here

01:55.683 --> 01:57.549
with burns
and wounds from rubber bullets.

01:57.551 --> 02:00.285
But without the Cipro,
we won't have any patients.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.788
Typhus is going to kill
everyone, including you.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:13.267 --> 02:15.634
It's not right, Nina.
He's been MIA for 14 years.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.836
He doesn't just get to show up
and be daddy.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.238
You heard his story.

02:19.239 --> 02:20.639
He said he didn't know
about Brianna.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.475
Then we need to test him.
He needs to prove he's blood.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.846
Thanks, Nina.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.849
Can I grab you for a minute?
Sure.

02:33.854 --> 02:36.421
Hey.

02:37.591 --> 02:39.158
That was a little weird, huh?

02:39.160 --> 02:40.459
Very.

02:40.461 --> 02:41.727
But that's it, right?

02:41.729 --> 02:44.196
I met him,
and now he'll leave us alone?

02:44.198 --> 02:46.431
It might be a little
more complicated than that, Bri.

02:46.433 --> 02:47.866
If he is
your biological father...

02:47.868 --> 02:49.334
I don't care.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.336
I want you and Rick
to be my dads.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.205
I'm going home
with you guys today, right?

02:53.207 --> 02:55.474
Actually,
that is on hold, sweetheart.

02:55.476 --> 02:57.543
Justin is filing a custody suit.

02:57.545 --> 02:58.610
A lawsuit...
Are you joking?

02:58.612 --> 02:59.878
Just please let me get into it.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.213
So I have to go with him?

03:01.215 --> 03:02.481
No.
No.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.882
You might have to stay
in another foster home

03:03.884 --> 03:05.217
until this works out.

03:05.219 --> 03:06.485
I... I don't want to,
Drew.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.187
That's not happening.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.888
I promise. You can't
promise, I'm sorry.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.357
Guys, this is up to lawyers
and judges now.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.259
We will start to work this
on our end,

03:14.261 --> 03:16.261
but this is real.

03:16.262 --> 03:18.262
Night shift just got extended
into the day 'cause of the fire.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.765
Okay, I won't leave her side
until you or Rick are here.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.634
Thank you.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.502
Hey, it's going to be okay,
I promise.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.437
Okay.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.372
I'll figure this out, okay?

03:27.374 --> 03:28.640
Okay.
All right?

03:28.642 --> 03:29.708
Okay, I love you.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.943
Love you, too.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.579
Bye.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.581
Army strong.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.649
You're really pissing me off.

03:37.651 --> 03:38.850
You said end of shift, Kenny.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.619
Yeah, we got extended
because of the fire.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.720
I-I got hurt people,
Moss.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.255
I just can't go
to the bank, man.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.823
I show up here again
and you don't have it,

03:44.825 --> 03:46.858
we're going to have a problem.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.694
Are you clear about that?

03:48.696 --> 03:49.962
Yeah, no, I know.

03:49.964 --> 03:51.663
I got it.
I swear.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.398
We'll see, man.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.934
Hey, Ray!

03:55.936 --> 03:58.237
Can you take the kids to
the lounge and throw in a movie?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.539
Not that drunk-driving video. I still
got parents calling me about that.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.507
There's some real funny moments.

04:02.509 --> 04:03.675
Okay.
Come on.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.843
Let's go with Ray, kids.

04:04.845 --> 04:06.395
Follow me.
Whee!

04:06.396 --> 04:07.946
What's with the, uh,
kids and old people?

04:07.948 --> 04:10.816
Yeah, the sheriff evacuated
a preschool and nursing home,

04:10.818 --> 04:12.951
check for dehydration
and smoke exposure.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.686
What's going on with, uh, Bri?

04:14.688 --> 04:16.855
Last-minute legal stuff.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.958
Jessica.
Here to give blood?

04:19.959 --> 04:22.995
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
Vampires... they <i> drink</i> blood.

04:22.997 --> 04:25.530
Are you done, Topher?
Not yet.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.332
I've got 12 hours
before the sale closes

04:27.334 --> 04:29.468
and Hobart officially
owns the place. Let me guess,

04:29.470 --> 04:31.536
you're here to measure curtains
for your new office.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.005
Yes, actually, I am.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.674
Yeah. And to make sure this
transition is painless.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.442
Except for
the staff getting fired

04:37.444 --> 04:39.778
and the poor patients
that you refuse to see.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.713
Other than that,
all good, right?

04:41.715 --> 04:42.848
This is just business.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.650
When are you going to see that?

04:44.652 --> 04:46.285
Hopefully never.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.486
Just hear me out, Paul.

04:47.488 --> 04:48.954
Why?
You have all the answers.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.722
I mean, you knew
that I didn't get

04:50.724 --> 04:52.658
what you were going through,
right?

04:52.660 --> 04:54.459
You're right, okay?
I'm sorry,

04:54.461 --> 04:57.362
but I had no idea you called
your dad to buy the E.R.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.664
I haven't bought it yet.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.733
Uh, Dad.
You're early.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.969
That's the perks
of flying private.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.371
That Gulfstream
is a game changer.

05:06.373 --> 05:08.040
Yeah, I bet.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.708
Uh, this is Dr. Rivera,
our intern.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.476
Great to meet you.
How are you?

05:11.478 --> 05:14.479
Shannon?
There's a burn in trauma one.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.516
Okay, well, we will talk later,
Dr. Cummings.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.617
Okay.
Sure.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.022
Uh, hey, you remember
Dr. Zia, Topher.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.757
Oh, of course, how are you?

05:25.759 --> 05:27.659
Much better
now that you're here.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.362
Um, Hobart is buying us
for pennies on the dollar.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.331
We have veteran doctors,
community ties,

05:32.333 --> 05:33.632
a nursing staff
that's willing...

05:33.634 --> 05:35.400
Y-Y-You can stop selling,
Topher.

05:35.402 --> 05:37.069
It's in
our bean counter's hands now.

05:37.071 --> 05:38.770
If it makes sense, we'll do it.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.038
Should know more in a few hours.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.374
Okay, well, if you're around,

05:42.376 --> 05:43.909
you want to suit up, we can use a hand.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.777
Uh, he just...
He just got off a long flight.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.946
I slept on the plane.
That's a great idea.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.748
Great.
Paul, get him some scrubs.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.417
Yeah, yeah.
Good to have you.

05:52.419 --> 05:55.620
So, uh, how long have you
and Dr. Rivera been an item?

05:55.622 --> 05:57.389
What?
Uh, w-we're not...

05:57.391 --> 05:59.091
No, no, no, your sister told me.

05:59.093 --> 06:00.809
She's cute.

06:00.810 --> 06:02.570
I'm not so sure about
the purple hair, but...

06:04.180 --> 06:05.830
Look, I'll change
and meet you back here, son.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.065
Uh, yeah.
Yo, Paul?

06:07.067 --> 06:09.801
Sorry to hound, man,
but, uh, about that check...

06:09.803 --> 06:12.471
That... That bill
for the plumber is due today.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.906
Yeah, right. Uh, I'll grab my
checkbook from my locker, yeah?

06:14.908 --> 06:17.376
Thank you so much.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.880
All right, let's set her up
over here.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.816
She'll be safe here for a bit while
the fire's on the other side.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.651
This is
a hell of an O.R.

06:26.653 --> 06:29.154
We're going to have to wing it
without those med kits.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.956
Use that.
I keep it razor-sharp.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.057
Okay, that's good.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.157
We're going to have to
sterilize this

06:33.160 --> 06:35.060
along with her leg
as best as we can.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.995
Hey, Mac,
there's bleach right there.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.315
Where?

06:40.316 --> 06:41.799
Buddy, you going blind on me?
It's right there.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.769
Uh, smoke dried out my contacts.

06:43.771 --> 06:44.770
Here.

06:44.772 --> 06:45.837
Here, Scott, use this.

06:45.839 --> 06:46.872
How you doing, Rene?

06:46.874 --> 06:48.340
I'm good.

06:48.341 --> 06:49.807
You were always
the toughest grunt I ever met.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.110
Yeah, that's 'cause I can
drink you under the table.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.685
Long way from Texas, Doctor.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.788
You speak English.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.955
A year in Detroit.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.690
What a dump.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.859
Yeah.
We're from the camp clinic.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.128
There was a parachute
that dropped some meds.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.431
We need that.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.733
I don't know any parachute,
and I don't know you,

07:14.735 --> 07:16.067
so get lost.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.836
Okay, listen, man,
we need that medicine, okay?

07:17.838 --> 07:19.604
Or else everybody in this camp
is going to die.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.640
It's a war zone, <i>man.</i>

07:21.642 --> 07:24.209
People die here, so be careful.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.144
People don't have to die,
so what...

07:27.948 --> 07:29.748
It's no use, T.C.
They're Turks.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.950
They hate us.
They won't let us in.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.985
Maybe we won't have to ask.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.824
Get away!

07:38.826 --> 07:41.626
Hands up!
Put your hands up!

07:51.171 --> 07:54.773
You want to talk, smart guy?

07:54.775 --> 07:56.975
Let's talk.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.834
I'll tourniquet her leg
to control the bleeding.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.469
After I make the incision,

08:24.470 --> 08:26.103
we'll use these as retractors
to hold the wound open.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.073
You're going old school, huh?

08:28.075 --> 08:30.141
Civil War old.
Yeah.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.711
This is not going to be easy
for her.

08:41.221 --> 08:43.889
Here.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.891
We'll use these.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.227
They are time-release,
so if we crush 'em,

08:49.229 --> 08:50.562
they'll absorb faster.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.964
You always carry Norco around
on you?

08:52.966 --> 08:55.600
I just knew
that Rene had a broken leg,

08:55.602 --> 08:58.537
so I grabbed some
from the medic before I left.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.105
Quick thinking.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.908
Thanks.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.011
Here you go, sweetie.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.747
You're going to dissolve these
under your tongue.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.749
It'll taste like hell,
but it'll help with the pain.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.851
This is going to knock her
on her ass, right, doc?

09:12.853 --> 09:13.952
Yeah.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.687
All right.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.255
I'm going to go check
on the fire, okay?

09:17.257 --> 09:19.591
I'm going to make sure
we're not blindsided.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.593
Okay. Here you go, honey.
Let's put this under your head.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.912
Thank you.

09:23.913 --> 09:26.230
Well, the roof caught fire
and the sheriff told us to go,

09:26.233 --> 09:28.633
but Carter remembered
the laptop was still inside.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.268
So he ran back,
and the ceiling fell.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.904
I had to get it, Dani. It has
our wedding pictures in it.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.905
Mm.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.740
Best day of my life.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.876
Oh, a costumed wedding...
Bold choice.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.011
Oh, well, we met
at a comic-book store.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.847
I was The Flash because of
how fast I fell for her,

09:42.849 --> 09:44.883
and Dani was
Wonder Woman because...

09:44.885 --> 09:47.252
Because she's so wonderful.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.922
Oh, and your wedding party
were the Super Friends?

09:50.924 --> 09:52.857
Justice League. Justice League...
actually.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.442
Ah, cool.

09:54.443 --> 09:56.026
Well...
Oh, speaking of superheroes,

09:56.029 --> 09:58.063
here comes your
surgical consult, Dr. Cummings,

09:58.065 --> 09:59.297
and his dad,
Dr. Cummings.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.216
Carter and Dani Stafford.

10:01.217 --> 10:03.134
Looks like the impact
fractured his frontal sinus.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.420
It involves the inner table.

10:05.421 --> 10:07.705
No worries, Carter. We'll have
you all fixed up in no time.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.140
Wait, he needs surgery?

10:09.142 --> 10:10.642
W-We can't afford that.

10:10.644 --> 10:11.977
We're both out of work
right now.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.878
All right...
Actually, you don't.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.213
Fixing it is, uh, risky,

10:15.215 --> 10:17.215
and these usually heal
on their own.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.018
And we don't want to risk
unnecessary trauma to the brain.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.186
That's great, Doctor.

10:21.188 --> 10:22.854
Uh, excuse me, Dad.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.122
Not entirely, okay?

10:24.124 --> 10:25.957
Doing nothing increases
the risk of infection.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.976
A little,

10:27.977 --> 10:29.994
but surgery would increase
their financial burden a lot.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.997
Look at
the bigger picture here, Paul.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.331
Actually, I-I am,
Dad.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.101
So you can see the costs
far outweigh the benefits.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.269
As I said, they usually heal
on their own.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.205
Well, that sounds a lot better
than surgery.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.941
So, there you have it.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.242
See,
Paul, Dr. Rivera,

10:44.244 --> 10:47.679
it's always good to give
your patients a choice.

10:47.681 --> 10:51.049
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have business to attend to.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.951
Thanks, Doc.
Appreciate it.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.354
Your dad is amazing.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.690
He's super smart, huh?

10:58.692 --> 11:01.226
Yeah, he definitely knows
what he's doing.

11:01.228 --> 11:02.394
Excuse me.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.197
You wanted to be arrested.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.233
Are you stupid or crazy?

11:08.235 --> 11:09.801
Desperate, Captain.

11:09.803 --> 11:12.337
If we don't get the medicine
from that air drop,

11:12.339 --> 11:14.239
everyone in that camp will die.

11:14.241 --> 11:16.107
My village is a mile from here.

11:16.109 --> 11:20.979
It was happy...
safe...

11:20.981 --> 11:22.847
heaven.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.250
Then the refugees
overrun my town.

11:25.252 --> 11:28.053
They bring disease
and crime and fear.

11:28.055 --> 11:31.756
Now my children have no doctors,
no schools.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.425
No one cares about us.

11:33.427 --> 11:36.695
They only care about
the terrorists.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.730
Maybe we can make a deal.

11:38.732 --> 11:41.232
What could you possibly
offer me?

11:41.234 --> 11:43.868
Everyone has a price.
Name it.

11:45.972 --> 11:48.006
Emir!

11:56.049 --> 12:00.351
This is Emir, my son.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.353
He has hip dysplasia.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.922
Doctors can't help him here,

12:03.924 --> 12:06.057
and I can't afford surgery
in Ankara.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.393
Can you do it?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.295
I'm not an orthopedic surgeon,

12:10.297 --> 12:12.230
but there is one in the camp.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.033
She can fix your boy.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.367
She?

12:16.369 --> 12:19.971
Army surgeon, Iraq, Afghanistan,
best of the best.

12:19.973 --> 12:22.273
But she'll want the meds first.

12:22.275 --> 12:25.510
She can help Emir to run,
play soccer.

12:25.512 --> 12:27.345
Football, papa?

12:27.347 --> 12:29.013
Yeah, football.

12:30.883 --> 12:32.750
All you got to do
is give us the Cipro.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.053
She can fix your boy.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.522
And he can play soccer.

12:37.524 --> 12:38.890
Promise.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.096
Okay.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.433
Meds are working, Drew.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.034
Fever's coming down...
100.2.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.536
Oh, that's great news.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.072
It's okay, guys, I'm fine.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.807
I'm not really sick.

12:55.809 --> 12:58.943
Bri, a fever is very serious
after a transplant.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.079
It's not because of
the transplant.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.081
I faked it.
You what?

13:03.083 --> 13:05.283
I, uh, took this thing called
niacin flush.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.786
It's a vitamin
that simulates fever and rash.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.021
I took it last year
to get out of school.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.456
Bri, why would you do that?

13:11.458 --> 13:14.058
That is so dangerous! Your body
is adjusting to a new lung.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.960
Don't you do that ever again.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.462
You understand?

13:17.463 --> 13:18.963
I just thought
that if I was still sick,

13:18.965 --> 13:21.332
that maybe I wouldn't have to go
to another foster home.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.001
If...
And this is a big if...

13:23.003 --> 13:25.470
You have to spend more time
in another foster home,

13:25.472 --> 13:27.322
I promise you,

13:27.323 --> 13:29.173
we will park our truck outside
that house and sleep in it.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.508
We're not leaving you.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.843
You're our daughter now.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.112
Nothing's going to change that.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.380
Okay?

13:35.382 --> 13:37.515
Okay.

13:37.517 --> 13:38.583
I'm really sorry.
Okay.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.289
Look, um,
we haven't had a chance

13:44.291 --> 13:46.524
to really talk about
what's going on.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.394
I mean, not with
the hospital, but...

13:49.396 --> 13:50.929
for you, with your dad.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.714
It's all good.

13:52.715 --> 13:54.498
For the rest of us,
yes, it's amazing, but...

13:54.501 --> 13:57.368
I don't want it
to come at a cost for you.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.103
I can handle it, Topher.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.272
Okay, but being able
to... to handle it

14:01.274 --> 14:03.408
is not a way
to go through life, Paul.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.343
It's just sucking up the stress.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.945
That doesn't help anybody.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.214
Look, maybe I'm wrong

14:09.216 --> 14:11.216
or out of line
for even saying this,

14:11.218 --> 14:13.151
but I don't think
your dad is here

14:13.153 --> 14:15.186
because he thinks
it's a great deal.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.855
I think he's here for you.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.174
For me?
Yeah.

14:19.175 --> 14:21.492
Fathers and sons can't always
communicate clearly.

14:21.494 --> 14:25.296
I think he's doing this
to share something with you.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.965
Well, he sure has
a funny way of showing it.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.900
Hey, at least he's showing it.

14:28.902 --> 14:31.035
Dr. Cummings,
something's wrong!

14:32.239 --> 14:34.505
What is this stuff?

14:34.507 --> 14:35.924
Cerebrospinal fluid.

14:35.925 --> 14:37.342
The crack of your frontal sinus
must have widened.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.111
I knew it.
Let's get him to the O.R.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.879
Your dad said he didn't need it!
My dad was wrong.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.248
Heard there was a complication?
Yeah, I got it.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.549
All right, let's get him
to surgery.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.251
Where have I heard that before?
Paul.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.120
I got this, Doctor.
Stay out of my O.R.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.097
T.C.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.166
You made it.
Yeah.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.435
Hamdi told me what happened
at the gate.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.304
Yeah.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.472
You didn't get the Cipro.

15:07.474 --> 15:10.241
Sort of.
I made a deal.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.727
This is Yusuf.

15:12.728 --> 15:14.378
He runs the border gate,
and that's his son Emir.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.446
He has, uh...

15:15.448 --> 15:17.115
Developmental hip dysplasia.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.316
Yeah.

15:18.318 --> 15:20.151
Okay.

15:20.153 --> 15:22.687
All right.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.157
I'm Dr. Syd.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.026
She has typhus, too?

15:29.029 --> 15:30.362
With the antibiotics,

15:30.363 --> 15:31.696
she will be strong enough
to fix him, Yusuf.

15:31.698 --> 15:35.066
Can you excuse us
for a moment, please?

15:36.336 --> 15:38.703
Hip reconstruction?
Are you nuts?

15:38.705 --> 15:40.388
I'm sick as hell.

15:40.389 --> 15:42.072
I know, but this will reduce
your bacterial loads,

15:42.075 --> 15:43.508
slow down your fever,

15:43.509 --> 15:44.942
and I'll be with you
the whole time.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.344
That's supposed to
make me feel better?

15:46.346 --> 15:48.980
It's a long surgery,
T.C.

15:48.982 --> 15:51.115
- I'm too weak.
- I can't.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.216
Syd.

15:52.218 --> 15:53.584
You don't have a choice.

15:53.586 --> 15:55.586
If that kid
doesn't get the surgery,

15:55.588 --> 15:57.121
we don't get the Cipro.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.097
So, uh, if Hobart
buys the hospital,

16:06.099 --> 16:07.498
are you going to move to Dallas?

16:07.500 --> 16:10.034
Prez is backing up
the money truck.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.270
It's going to be tough
to say no.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.205
Would Annie go with you?

16:14.207 --> 16:16.607
Uh...
Does she know?

16:16.609 --> 16:19.143
Yeah, she does.

16:19.145 --> 16:22.013
She got talking last week
about moving in together,

16:22.015 --> 16:23.514
and I pumped the brakes.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.249
I just need time to think.

16:25.251 --> 16:26.517
Everything's moving too fast.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.119
And yes, I know you told me so.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.654
I wasn't going to say that.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.222
Well, I'm glad I did.

16:31.224 --> 16:33.658
I just feel responsible for her.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.761
I'm so afraid
that she's going to relapse,

16:36.763 --> 16:38.496
and that colors everything.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.664
Anyway, I'm rambling.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.232
Okay, released the fascia,

16:41.234 --> 16:43.001
and that should relieve
the pressure.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.703
You know, Annie asked me
if I wanted you back.

16:45.705 --> 16:46.704
What did you say?

16:46.706 --> 16:48.723
The truth.

16:48.724 --> 16:50.741
You know,
I don't know what I want.

16:50.744 --> 16:52.543
That wasn't a no.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.445
It wasn't a yes.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.347
How is she?

16:56.349 --> 16:57.648
She's better.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.184
We restored blood flow.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.452
We can't be dragging her
around right now.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.104
We need 20 more minutes.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.305
Let's at least get her outside.
Keep an eye on the fire.

17:06.326 --> 17:09.694
Nice fracture elevation, Paul.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.445
Thanks.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.196
It'd have been a lot easier
a few hours ago.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.333
Look, Paul, I know you're upset,

17:15.335 --> 17:18.036
so let's just
rip off the Band-Aid.

17:18.038 --> 17:19.271
Okay.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.505
For starters,
let's talk about the real reason

17:20.507 --> 17:22.640
you didn't want to do surgery
on that patient.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.642
You thought
you weren't going to get paid.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.077
You think
that's all I care about?

17:26.079 --> 17:27.512
You just bought a jet, Dad.

17:27.513 --> 17:29.347
It's a tool.

17:29.348 --> 17:31.181
I've learned that I can
impact lives from a boardroom

17:31.184 --> 17:33.051
as much as I can
from an O.R.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.318
It's opened
a whole new world for me.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.087
Okay, but this is <i> my</i> world.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.189
I came to Texas
to be <i> Paul</i> Cummings,

17:38.191 --> 17:40.191
not...
Not Julian Cummings' son.

17:40.193 --> 17:42.226
But the moment you got here, you
dismissed me like some teenager.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.262
I was just following
my gut, Paul.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.363
Yeah, me, too.

17:45.365 --> 17:47.365
And today, mine was right.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.400
But you couldn't hear that.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.369
Well, I hear you now.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.637
Loud and clear.

17:52.639 --> 17:54.605
I'll do better, Paul.

17:54.607 --> 17:55.606
I promise.

17:55.608 --> 17:59.377
We'll figure it out, okay?

18:00.346 --> 18:02.313
O-Okay.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.315
Okay.

18:08.354 --> 18:12.156
She's going to need another
10 minutes before we move her.

18:12.158 --> 18:13.858
All right, you got five.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.360
I'm gonna go check on Mac, okay?

18:18.498 --> 18:20.498
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.233
How you doing?

18:22.235 --> 18:24.502
Rene going to be okay?

18:24.504 --> 18:25.870
She's going to be okay.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.606
You know, she's going to need
a skin graft,

18:28.608 --> 18:30.108
but she'll have a scar.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.843
That's a shame.
She got nice gams.

18:31.845 --> 18:33.067
Oh, you've noticed?

18:33.068 --> 18:34.290
She was a member
of the Cultural Support Team

18:34.291 --> 18:35.513
attached to my unit
in Afghanistan.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.048
A lot of the officers,

18:37.049 --> 18:38.582
they like to hit on
the enlisted women.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.519
I liked her,
but I never crossed that line.

18:41.521 --> 18:44.622
So, I asked her to join Rubicon.

18:46.192 --> 18:48.159
And fight fires.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.661
Wow, Mac, that's insanely
romantic of you.

18:52.114 --> 18:53.564
Have you ever considered maybe,
I don't know,

18:53.566 --> 18:55.133
taking her out to dinner?

18:55.135 --> 18:58.903
Uh, look, I wanted to,
but the timing's never right.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.705
I been divorced twice.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.740
Inconceivable differences.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.876
"Inconceivable"?

19:04.878 --> 19:07.211
You know, where you can't
get past something.

19:07.213 --> 19:09.881
There's something going on
with you, isn't there?

19:09.883 --> 19:11.616
You know, with your head.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.817
'Cause I was a Ranger?

19:12.819 --> 19:15.153
I mean, you should know.
You dated Callahan.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.822
No, I am talking about
your symptoms.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.857
You have
left-sided weakness,

19:19.859 --> 19:23.294
blurred peripheral vision,
jumbled language.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.829
I got a GBM, Stage Four.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.431
They gave me two months
without surgery,

19:27.433 --> 19:28.466
six months with.

19:28.468 --> 19:29.567
Oh, man.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.202
I'm not dying alone at the VA.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.504
My brain scrambled
trying to relearn the alphabet.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.674
If I can't be a soldier,
I'm going to fall on my shield.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.177
I'm going to...
I'm going to be useful.

19:39.179 --> 19:40.845
Does Rene know?

19:40.847 --> 19:43.248
No.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.650
Just to make her feel sad
and hopeless?

19:45.652 --> 19:48.252
I think she'd want
to be there for you.

19:48.254 --> 19:49.587
She can't do anything, Doc.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.888
The truth may set you free,

19:50.890 --> 19:52.924
but it doesn't always help
the person here.

19:52.926 --> 19:55.626
Okay, her vitals are stable.

19:55.628 --> 19:56.727
We good?

19:56.729 --> 19:58.696
Yeah, never better.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.600
Come on, let's get the hell
off this mountain.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.901
Okay?
Yeah.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.337
Hey.
We're almost home.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.605
Yeah.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.540
Come on, we got to go.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.576
The wind's shifting.

20:12.979 --> 20:15.880
He's torn away
most of the labrum.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.215
Is that bad?

20:17.217 --> 20:18.749
It means the joint's
mal-aligned.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.551
Lucky we got to it
before it fractured.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.686
Will he be okay?

20:21.688 --> 20:24.355
He should be
once I realign the joint.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.457
I need more milk.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.992
What did she say?

20:27.994 --> 20:29.727
We're out. Riley's got school
tomorrow. We need milk.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.629
Who is Riley? She loves
her cereal and...

20:31.631 --> 20:34.599
I see how the other moms
look at me and...

20:34.601 --> 20:35.733
Syd.
Syd, what's going on?

20:35.735 --> 20:36.934
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm great.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.536
She... she's okay. Oh, oh, oh!

20:38.538 --> 20:40.805
Syd!
Hey, Syd!

20:40.807 --> 20:41.839
Open your eyes.

20:41.841 --> 20:42.873
What's wrong with her?

20:42.875 --> 20:44.342
What about my son?

20:44.344 --> 20:46.277
Hold on.
Look at me, hey. Syd!

20:51.851 --> 20:53.951
She'll be awake
in a few minutes.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.454
She was just delirious
from her fever.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.755
The IV and ice pack
should cool her down.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.858
What about my son?
Finish the operation.

21:00.860 --> 21:01.892
I can't do that.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.427
You said you'd fix him.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.296
I know, but I need her
to finish his surgery.

21:05.298 --> 21:06.881
Listen to me...

21:06.882 --> 21:08.465
His oxygen and blood pressure
are dropping, doctor.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.034
Okay, he must have
thrown a clot.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.902
Give me 100 milligrams
of alteplase.

21:11.904 --> 21:14.438
Nurse, can you finish on Dr.
Jennings? Yes, doctor.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.741
You are killing my son!
Please, finish the surgery!

21:16.743 --> 21:19.644
Clots are a risk of surgery.
The medicine will work.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.413
His oxygen's coming up.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.714
BP's at 105 systolic.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.316
Okay, this is insanity!

21:25.318 --> 21:26.634
Close him up!

21:26.635 --> 21:27.951
We are leaving now, and you
are not getting the Cipro!

21:27.954 --> 21:29.954
You're not leaving!
We... We need the Cipro.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.589
Syd has just got a fever.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.624
If I can wake her up, she can
talk me through the surgery,

21:33.626 --> 21:36.327
and your boy will walk again.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.062
It's his only chance.

21:39.032 --> 21:40.765
Your husband's
doing well in recovery.

21:40.767 --> 21:42.066
God, thank you so much.

21:42.068 --> 21:44.669
Carter's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.438
You know,
we're paycheck to paycheck,

21:47.440 --> 21:48.773
last hired, first fired.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.741
On to the next.
That's tough.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.026
Yeah.

21:52.027 --> 21:53.310
He's really optimistic, though.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.430
You know, he's always, like,

21:55.431 --> 21:57.548
blue skies always
above the clouds, they'll pass.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.016
I know a guy like that.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.752
You got to keep him
'cause a guy like that,

22:01.754 --> 22:03.754
he... he can get you
through anything.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.901
Test proves it.
I'm her daddy.

22:16.903 --> 22:19.570
Courts will give me
full custody.

22:19.572 --> 22:21.139
It's not a slam dunk.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.707
We're going to fight you
every inch of the way.

22:22.709 --> 22:23.974
It's not about the courts.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.576
It's about Brianna.
She has medical needs.

22:25.578 --> 22:29.013
Living with a doctor
would make life easier for her.

22:29.015 --> 22:30.981
I'll learn what she needs,

22:30.983 --> 22:33.551
and she'll come to love me
in time.

22:33.553 --> 22:34.769
And if <i> you</i> loved <i> her,</i>

22:34.770 --> 22:35.986
you wouldn't be doing this
to her.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.855
Hey, I just found out
I had a kid.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.457
I want to get to know her.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.524
Have I messed up?

22:40.526 --> 22:41.892
Have I done time?

22:41.894 --> 22:43.894
Yes to all the above.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.030
But she's mine.

22:46.032 --> 22:48.733
She's not a puppy you get
to take home, Justin.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.668
Think about what's best for Bri.

22:50.670 --> 22:51.669
I am.

22:51.671 --> 22:55.473
Look...

22:55.475 --> 22:57.308
if I came down here

22:57.309 --> 22:59.142
and saw a nice, respectable
couple taking care of her,

22:59.145 --> 23:02.480
maybe it would go that way.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.948
But you two?

23:04.917 --> 23:07.385
I can't allow that.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.886
<i>You</i> can't allow that?!

23:08.888 --> 23:11.655
We served our country, asshole,
in war.

23:11.657 --> 23:12.957
While you were out getting high

23:12.959 --> 23:14.558
and stealing
other people's stuff,

23:14.560 --> 23:16.460
we were out there
fighting for your freedom.

23:16.462 --> 23:17.628
Drew.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.964
Don't do him any favors.

23:24.137 --> 23:25.536
I'll see you boys in court.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.410
I am going to beat him
until he bleeds out.

23:32.412 --> 23:33.944
That's not going to help Bri.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.546
We can't lose her.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.181
Let me see what I can find.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.717
I'll check his records.

23:46.626 --> 23:50.661
Okay, I've detached
the acetabulum from the pelvis.

23:50.663 --> 23:51.929
Syd?

23:51.931 --> 23:53.497
I'm right here with you.

23:53.499 --> 23:57.168
Just rotate it
towards the femoral head.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.736
Got it.
Rotating now.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.938
101, her fever broke.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.873
Okay, good.
Keep it on the run.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.675
Another round of ibuprofen.

24:04.677 --> 24:06.610
Okay, Syd, what's next?

24:06.612 --> 24:09.213
Now, you secure the joint
with the surgical screws.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.184
Gentle.

24:18.691 --> 24:19.690
How much longer?

24:19.692 --> 24:21.625
Almost done.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.107
Nice job, Syd.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.478
You nearly killed me, Callahan.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.112
Nah, I had you the whole time.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.920
Mac?!

24:51.624 --> 24:52.623
Mac?!
What?

24:52.625 --> 24:53.757
I think we're turned around.

24:53.759 --> 24:55.860
Damn it,
the fire's right on our tail.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.194
What are we going to do?

24:57.196 --> 24:58.996
Heat rises. We can't outrun it.
Come here, take this.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.731
You're lead dog now, okay, Doc?

25:00.733 --> 25:02.733
Just head south
for a couple more miles.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.935
You'll find the base.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.538
What are you doing?

25:07.540 --> 25:08.873
Set a back burn,

25:08.874 --> 25:10.207
use up all the fuel
between you and the fire.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.859
That's too dangerous.
We stay together.

25:11.860 --> 25:13.510
I'm your only chance
now, all right? No.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.196
We'll never outrun it.

25:15.197 --> 25:16.880
I got to put a barrier
between us and the fire.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.649
He knows what he's doing, Scott.

25:18.651 --> 25:20.651
Take care of my girl, okay?

25:24.190 --> 25:26.824
All right, come on, get
your asses moving, let's go!

25:28.127 --> 25:30.628
Come on.

25:30.630 --> 25:31.695
Let's do it.

25:41.423 --> 25:42.806
Rick looked at sealed records?

25:42.808 --> 25:45.075
His buddy at the courthouse
showed him, okay?

25:45.077 --> 25:47.111
And he found out that Justin
did know about Brianna.

25:47.113 --> 25:49.213
He was in jail for drugs
when her mother was pregnant,

25:49.215 --> 25:51.198
and she tried to get him out,

25:51.199 --> 25:53.182
told his parole board that
he was the father of her child.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.085
Which means he did give up
parental rights.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.220
Wow.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.155
We caught him in a lie.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.941
We had to leave Mac
up on that hill.

26:00.942 --> 26:02.825
Tell search and rescue to send
a chopper up there for him now.

26:02.828 --> 26:07.097
Two grams of ancef and IV fluids
the second she's on board.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.734
Is Mac going to make it, Doc?
I don't know.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.269
We left him in a bad spot.

26:12.270 --> 26:13.803
He set another burn
so we could get out of there.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.272
Search and rescue's
headed up there now.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.007
But he asked us
to take care of his girl,

26:17.009 --> 26:18.676
so let's get you
to the hospital, okay?

26:18.678 --> 26:20.428
His girl?

26:20.429 --> 26:22.179
I knew he liked me,
but he hadn't asked me out yet.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.114
It's going to be okay,
Rene, okay?

26:24.116 --> 26:26.183
Take care of her.
Thank you, Jordan.

26:29.155 --> 26:31.255
Dr. Clemmens,
I got a note for you.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.923
Thanks.

26:33.893 --> 26:36.360
It's from Topher.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.729
Mac has a GBM.

26:38.731 --> 26:39.997
Stage Four.

26:39.999 --> 26:41.131
I know.

26:41.133 --> 26:42.866
He told me.

26:42.868 --> 26:44.935
It's why he went back out there.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.137
He knew
he wasn't going to make it.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.841
And you didn't tell Rene?

26:50.843 --> 26:53.110
It's not my truth to tell.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.745
See you guys
back at the hospital.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.146
But this is.

26:56.148 --> 26:57.715
Look, um...

26:57.717 --> 26:59.249
Okay.

26:59.251 --> 27:02.286
Scott, I didn't bring these
from the hospital.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.122
I found them in T.C.'s coat
in his locker.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.858
The one that Annie uses.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.060
It's the Norco from the Pixus.

27:15.167 --> 27:18.002
She told me
she didn't steal these.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.887
Scott, I am so sorry.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.771
I wasn't going to tell you, but
I was afraid that if I didn't,

27:21.774 --> 27:23.641
she would drag you down
into her rabbit hole.

27:23.643 --> 27:27.311
And I know how bad
that could be for you.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.015
This is your call, okay?

27:31.017 --> 27:33.117
I'm not going to interfere.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.153
Thank you.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.889
Come on, our ride's leaving.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.695
Emir is still coming out
of anesthesia,

27:44.697 --> 27:46.864
but he'll be awake
in a few hours.

27:46.866 --> 27:47.898
Thank you.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.933
I'd given up hope.

27:49.935 --> 27:52.069
Hope is the world's
best medicine.

27:52.071 --> 27:54.938
But for now, I'll...
I'll just take the Cipro.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.845
Thank you.

28:06.819 --> 28:09.820
Okay.

28:09.822 --> 28:11.422
Maybe I did know
about her being born.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.324
Maybe I changed my mind.

28:14.326 --> 28:16.960
You already waived your rights,
so drop the suit.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.946
You can't win.

28:18.947 --> 28:20.931
Give me $20,000, I'll walk away.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.332
I knew this wasn't
about Brianna.

28:22.334 --> 28:24.134
That's extortion.

28:24.136 --> 28:25.436
I'm a cop.

28:25.438 --> 28:27.905
By the way,
this can drag on a long time.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.707
You know, I was set
to offer you visitation,

28:29.709 --> 28:31.842
let you into our home,

28:31.844 --> 28:33.844
so you can make amends
with Brianna

28:33.845 --> 28:35.845
because maybe one day,
she'd want to get to know you.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.981
But you can shove that
up your ass.

28:37.983 --> 28:39.383
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

28:39.385 --> 28:41.752
So, do we have a deal?

28:41.754 --> 28:43.987
You have no case.

28:43.989 --> 28:46.990
They owe you nothing.

28:46.992 --> 28:48.392
You have messed up
this girl's life enough.

28:48.394 --> 28:52.129
Just get out of here
before we have you arrested.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.364
You got three seconds.

29:02.007 --> 29:03.140
Hey...

29:03.142 --> 29:04.842
had to try, right?

29:06.278 --> 29:08.479
Rich doctor.

29:08.481 --> 29:11.215
See you around.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.355
Let's get our girl.

29:23.763 --> 29:25.863
Hey.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.898
Good work on Carter today.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.400
You've come a long way
as a surgeon.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.035
Yeah, well,
I've learned a lot from Scott.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.103
Nonsense.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.404
You have a gift, Paul.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.156
Of all my children,

29:36.157 --> 29:37.907
you're the one who'll end up
better than me.

29:37.910 --> 29:41.779
I'd like your input
on all our surgical operations.

29:41.781 --> 29:42.913
Company-wide.

29:42.915 --> 29:44.982
You mean join management?

29:44.984 --> 29:48.051
Research, consult,
write your own ticket.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.186
You in?

29:49.188 --> 29:51.922
Yeah,
I'm... I'm in.

29:51.924 --> 29:53.791
Finally.

29:53.793 --> 29:56.927
It only cost me $50 million
to hear you say that.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.196
Wait, did you just buy
the hospital?

29:59.198 --> 30:01.165
Hey, uh, sorry, everybody,

30:01.167 --> 30:03.400
but I'm going to be
your new boss.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.003
Yes! Yes!
Whoo!

30:06.005 --> 30:07.805
Thank you, sir!

30:09.341 --> 30:10.340
Ah, Topher.

30:10.342 --> 30:12.376
I just heard the news.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.344
Congrats.
You did it.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.213
Thank you.

30:16.214 --> 30:18.081
Looks like
I'm going to lose <i> my</i> job now.

30:18.083 --> 30:20.450
Karma's a bitch, Jessica.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.555
Topher,
can I have a word with you?

30:24.557 --> 30:26.273
Sure, boss.

30:26.274 --> 30:27.990
I was surprised when Paul called
about this offer.

30:27.993 --> 30:30.327
He's been ambivalent
about the family trade.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.262
I don't...
I don't see it that way.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.031
He's a surgeon because of you.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.966
He holds himself
to a high standard

30:35.968 --> 30:37.367
because <i> you</i> set the bar.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.970
A-And thank you for
what you said to him, Topher.

30:39.972 --> 30:41.371
I heard about your talk.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.040
You gave me a chance.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.282
Now he's joining Cummings Group
as a surgical consultant.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.512
You raised a good son, Julian.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.514
And you helped make him
a good doctor.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.282
You're a great teacher, Topher.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.151
Thank you.
But not a manager.

30:54.153 --> 30:58.522
You pull out all the stops
for patients who can't pay.

30:58.524 --> 31:02.292
That... that's kind of
what we do here.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.461
That's what we used to do.

31:04.463 --> 31:07.397
This place needs
strong medicine now.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.566
If I didn't know any better,
Julian,

31:09.568 --> 31:11.535
I'd think you're letting me go.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.403
I am, Topher.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.440
I'm sorry.

31:16.442 --> 31:19.142
It's just business.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.454
Jordan!

31:30.456 --> 31:32.356
Hi.
Oh, thank God.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.224
Hi.
Are you okay?

31:34.226 --> 31:35.359
Yeah.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.195
So who had a baby?

31:38.197 --> 31:39.963
Oh, Paul's dad
bought the hospital.

31:39.965 --> 31:42.232
Yeah, these are the only
decorations I could find.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.368
Wait, Paul's dad, not Hobart?

31:44.370 --> 31:46.236
Ding dong,
the wicked witch is dead.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.640
Hey, guys. The weirdest thing. The
Norcos are back in the Pixus.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.441
What do you mean, they're back?

31:51.443 --> 31:53.477
2 are missing,
the other 10 are there.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.045
Too bad, Kenny.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.614
I guess that means your little
witch hunt is over.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.650
I guess so.
Sorry, Annie.

31:59.652 --> 32:02.653
Jordan,
do you know where Scott is?

32:02.655 --> 32:04.154
He called me.
He asked me to meet him here.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.923
Yeah, he's outside
getting fresh air.

32:05.925 --> 32:08.225
He wanted me to tell you
to meet him in the parking lot.

32:08.227 --> 32:09.593
Thanks.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.695
Guess I had that girl wrong.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.463
Mollie, will you do me a favor?

32:13.465 --> 32:14.882
Yeah.

32:14.883 --> 32:16.300
If you hear anything at all
about Mac, can you let me know?

32:16.302 --> 32:18.335
Yes, honey.
Thank you.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.922
Scott.

32:21.923 --> 32:24.207
Oh, my God,
I was so worried about you.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.110
I was worried about you, too.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.245
No, it's all good.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.147
Somebody put
the Norco pills back.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.548
I did, Annie.

32:31.550 --> 32:32.549
What?

32:32.551 --> 32:34.017
I know you took them.

32:34.019 --> 32:35.953
Jordan found them
in T.C.'s locker

32:35.955 --> 32:37.454
where you store your stuff.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.073
Is she accusing me of...

32:39.074 --> 32:40.691
And she is not telling Topher
out of respect for me.

32:40.693 --> 32:42.359
Which is going to
give you the chance

32:42.361 --> 32:44.695
to get the help that you need.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.030
I booked a bed for you
at the Alden Rehab for tonight.

32:47.032 --> 32:48.298
For tonight?

32:48.300 --> 32:49.700
Yeah, tonight.

32:49.702 --> 32:51.101
Are you kidding me?
No.

32:51.103 --> 32:53.170
I didn't use, Scott.
I can go to a meeting.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.572
You lied to my face
and you lied to Topher

32:55.574 --> 32:57.875
and you lied to Kenny,

32:57.876 --> 33:00.177
and if you think you can be here
around opiates being a nurse,

33:00.179 --> 33:02.012
then you're lying to yourself.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.351
You need to go back to rehab.

33:09.421 --> 33:13.123
Let's go.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.727
I'm not going.

33:16.729 --> 33:20.130
I'll go with you, okay?

33:21.100 --> 33:24.201
Let's go.

33:59.271 --> 34:02.172
Hey, Toph.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.540
Coming out to the bar?

34:03.542 --> 34:04.808
Everybody's grabbing drinks.
I can't.

34:04.810 --> 34:07.177
Um, I got stuff to do.

34:07.179 --> 34:09.179
You moving lockers now?

34:10.581 --> 34:14.184
Your dad fired me, Paul.

34:14.186 --> 34:15.786
He what?

34:15.788 --> 34:17.420
Yeah.

34:17.422 --> 34:18.789
Toph,
h-he can't do that.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.090
Yeah, he can.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.658
This place is his now.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.726
I'll be fine.

34:25.397 --> 34:28.398
Saving this hospital
wasn't about me.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.668
It was about helping people
with nowhere else to go.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.337
We did that today.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.072
Thanks to you.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.809
Don't ever forget that.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.364
So, I, too,

34:43.364 --> 34:45.181
will be here tomorrow
to work with billing systems.

34:45.184 --> 34:46.616
Hey, Dad, I need a word.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.552
Everybody, this is my son, Paul.

34:48.554 --> 34:51.288
He'll be a big part of our team
here moving forward.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.556
I'm... I'm not.

34:52.558 --> 34:54.257
Not unless you hire Topher back.

34:54.259 --> 34:55.692
You made a decision

34:55.693 --> 34:57.126
without consulting anyone
who works here.

34:57.129 --> 34:58.645
Look, Paul...

34:58.646 --> 35:00.162
No, no, no,
you said you would listen,

35:00.165 --> 35:01.631
and you didn't even ask me.

35:01.633 --> 35:02.766
You're never
going to change, Dad.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.201
Topher took everyone in.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.369
He treated them
with concierge medicine.

35:06.371 --> 35:08.171
It's why this place was broke.

35:08.173 --> 35:10.173
And what makes it different?

35:10.175 --> 35:11.575
He's the glue, Dad.

35:11.577 --> 35:14.311
Without him, you bought
a building, not a hospital.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.612
Look, I'm sorry
you feel that way,

35:15.614 --> 35:17.547
but I've made my decision.

35:17.549 --> 35:20.650
Now, back to billing, we...

35:20.652 --> 35:22.185
So have I.

35:22.187 --> 35:24.488
I resign.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.628
You've always had
a dramatic side, Paul.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.730
You get it from your mother.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.799
Terry, add finding
a new surgical resident

35:35.801 --> 35:37.734
to our to-do list.

35:37.736 --> 35:41.338
And another
E.R. department, too.

35:44.209 --> 35:45.359
Really?

35:45.360 --> 35:46.510
You're asking all these people
to walk out

35:46.512 --> 35:48.445
to win a pissing match
with your old man?

35:48.447 --> 35:49.646
It's not about you, Dad.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.748
It's about Topher.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.884
He goes, we go.

35:53.886 --> 35:55.785
You think hard on this, Paul.

35:55.787 --> 35:58.855
You walk out of here,
you walk away from your family.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.640
I'll cut you off.

36:00.641 --> 36:02.424
I'll stop paying
your med-school bills,

36:02.427 --> 36:04.494
your car lease.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.630
You'll be poor
for the first time in your life.

36:06.632 --> 36:09.366
And you're not
going to like it, son.

36:09.368 --> 36:12.702
I'm not walking away
from my family, Dad.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.371
This <i> is</i> my family.

36:26.652 --> 36:27.951
Why don't we continue?

36:33.525 --> 36:34.858
Another one from the fire,
Topher.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.826
Next shift has it.
Sorry, Sara.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.562
I'm...
I'm off the clock.

36:56.682 --> 37:00.250
So, that's it.

37:00.252 --> 37:01.518
We're out of work?

37:01.520 --> 37:02.852
We'll figure it out,

37:02.854 --> 37:05.422
find some place
to stay together.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.341
Damn straight.

37:07.342 --> 37:09.259
All right, night,
Drew, Toph, ladies.

37:09.261 --> 37:10.427
Night. Night. Night. Night.

37:10.429 --> 37:11.561
Night.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.630
Hey, uh, Kenny, you got a sec?

37:13.632 --> 37:16.566
All right, darling,
I'll walk you to your car.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.435
Okay.
I'll see you around.

37:18.437 --> 37:19.936
Yeah. Bye.
Bye.

37:27.446 --> 37:28.979
Look, I'm really sorry.

37:28.981 --> 37:30.714
My dad just cut me off,

37:30.716 --> 37:32.782
and I can't give you that loan.

37:32.784 --> 37:35.285
I kind of need that money
to survive.

37:35.287 --> 37:36.720
Okay.

37:36.722 --> 37:37.988
Maybe in a month or two?

37:37.990 --> 37:39.489
I didn't expect this to happen.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.024
I-I really am sorry.
I wanted to help.

37:41.026 --> 37:42.592
No, you did help.

37:42.594 --> 37:44.277
You did good.

37:44.278 --> 37:45.961
I'm proud of you
for standing up.

37:45.964 --> 37:48.248
It took stones.

37:48.249 --> 37:50.533
I'll just... I'll just
figure out another way.

37:55.340 --> 37:57.507
Thanks. I'll catch
you later, man.

38:18.363 --> 38:19.396
Hey.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.931
Hey.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.800
Your dad must be
pretty pissed, huh?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.068
Just a little, yeah.

38:26.437 --> 38:27.803
Where were, uh, where were you?

38:27.806 --> 38:28.905
Hiding.

38:28.907 --> 38:31.508
I'm so sorry, Paul,

38:31.510 --> 38:33.543
but I can't quit
like everybody else.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.645
If I do,
then I have to go back home,

38:35.647 --> 38:38.348
and I can't do that again.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.383
I-I know.
I don't want you to.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.086
I brought my dad here
so you wouldn't have to.

38:43.088 --> 38:46.656
I don't...
I don't understand.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.858
You lost everything.

38:49.895 --> 38:51.528
For <i> me?</i>

38:51.530 --> 38:53.363
Simple.

38:53.365 --> 38:56.866
I love you, Shannon.

39:00.072 --> 39:02.605
Now is where you run off
like your hair's on fire.

39:02.607 --> 39:04.741
I can't. I...

39:07.112 --> 39:10.080
I love you, too.

39:21.426 --> 39:22.459
Incoming!

39:22.461 --> 39:24.127
Who wants ice cream?!
I do!

39:24.129 --> 39:26.096
I scream, you scream...

39:26.098 --> 39:28.798
We all scream for ice cream!

39:28.800 --> 39:31.134
Let's do it.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.840
Well, looks like
you're back to normal.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.975
I am going back to my daughter,

39:38.977 --> 39:41.378
and I am never
letting her out of my sight.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.046
You?

39:43.047 --> 39:44.713
Hamdi told me about a camp
in Aleppo,

39:44.716 --> 39:46.916
so I'm going to
go check that out.

39:46.918 --> 39:48.551
What, the frying pan's
not hot enough for you?

39:48.553 --> 39:50.520
I like the heat.

39:50.522 --> 39:53.140
Yeah, you better be careful,
Callahan.

39:53.141 --> 39:55.759
I spent the past decade of my
life burning it to the ground,

39:55.761 --> 39:58.094
hoping it would
grow back different,

39:58.096 --> 40:01.564
but the only thing that
can make it different is you.

40:01.566 --> 40:02.899
I'll think about that.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.134
No, you won't.

40:04.136 --> 40:06.136
Shouldn't there be someone

40:06.138 --> 40:08.872
that you let know
where you're off to?

40:08.874 --> 40:10.407
Like Topher or Drew?

40:10.409 --> 40:12.475
I don't mean to be a downer,

40:12.477 --> 40:14.357
but where you're going,
you might not come back.

40:15.147 --> 40:17.714
Good point, thanks.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.682
You're a great doctor,
T.C.,

40:19.684 --> 40:22.018
and I hope
we never work together again.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.461
If I had a nickel for
every time somebody said that.

40:35.934 --> 40:36.934
Take care of yourself.

40:39.070 --> 40:41.404
You, too.

40:53.084 --> 40:55.752
