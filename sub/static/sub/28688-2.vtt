Thanks to your idiot son.

You're as much to blame
as he is.

00:35.347 --> 00:36.246
Wha... how?

00:36.348 --> 00:37.981
- Exactly.
- Wait, what?

00:38.084 --> 00:39.533
- You heard her!
- Don't yell at her!

00:39.635 --> 00:41.735

00:57.737 --> 00:59.903

didn't think you were.

01:08.013 --> 01:09.293

01:09.348 --> 01:12.066
Again, hard to tell with you

about delivery,

01:18.307 --> 01:20.040

01:20.142 --> 01:21.909
- I didn't steal it.
- I still have it.

01:22.011 --> 01:24.111
- You... where is it?
- On the "Seamus."

01:24.213 --> 01:26.713
I was bringing it to you.
Why do you think I'm here?

01:26.816 --> 01:28.899
Wha... because I captured you?

01:29.001 --> 01:30.768

- What?

01:30.870 --> 01:33.170
Look, let me go back to

I'm pretty stupid.

- Send a couple you don't like...
- Let me...

01:48.704 --> 01:50.637
Because if they punch in
the wrong combination,

01:50.739 --> 01:53.607
they're gonna be eating
a 20-kiloton burrito for lunch.
