00:08.709 --> 00:11.479
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

00:11.512 --> 00:14.215
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

00:14.248 --> 00:17.585
* Gonna leave you anyway.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.891
(faint ringing)

00:23.924 --> 00:26.294
(sighs)

00:31.031 --> 00:33.634
(crickets chirping)

00:43.244 --> 00:45.779
(exhales)

00:48.048 --> 00:49.883
(ticking)

00:54.388 --> 00:57.358
* I think I wanna,
think I wanna, think I wanna *

00:57.391 --> 01:00.094
(indistinct chatter
over headphones)

01:00.128 --> 01:02.863
* I think I wanna,
think I wanna, think I wanna *

01:02.896 --> 01:04.698
*

01:04.732 --> 01:07.034
* I think I wanna,
think I wanna, think I wanna *

01:07.067 --> 01:09.036
*

01:09.069 --> 01:11.539
* I think I wanna tell you
somethin' *

01:11.572 --> 01:13.407
* Well, go on,
tell me somethin' *

01:13.441 --> 01:16.244
* I think I wanna tell you
somethin' *

01:16.277 --> 01:18.479
* Well, go on,
tell me somethin' *

01:18.512 --> 01:20.914
* I think I wanna tell you
somethin' *

01:20.948 --> 01:23.083
* Well, go on,
tell me somethin' *

01:23.117 --> 01:25.986
* I think I wanna tell you
somethin' *

01:26.019 --> 01:27.755
* Tell me what?

01:27.788 --> 01:30.090
* I think I wanna,
think I wanna, think I wanna *

01:30.124 --> 01:32.326
* Please tell me now

01:32.360 --> 01:34.995
* I think I wanna,
think I wanna, think I wanna *

01:35.028 --> 01:36.497
...wanna tell you somethin'.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.799
I think
I wanna tell you somethin'.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.968
I think I wanna tell you
somethin'.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.070
I think
I wanna tell you somethin'.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.739
* I think I wanna,
think I wanna, think I wanna *

01:45.773 --> 01:47.475
*

01:47.508 --> 01:49.743
* I think I wanna,
think I wanna, think I wanna *

01:49.777 --> 01:52.146
(tires screech)

01:52.180 --> 01:54.615
(faint ringing)

01:57.151 --> 01:59.553
(dog barks in distance)

02:15.135 --> 02:17.538
(breathing deeply)

02:19.039 --> 02:21.409
(tires screech)

02:30.150 --> 02:32.786
* 'Cause I'm a creator
and a dominator *

02:32.820 --> 02:35.456
* You're not down for hittin'
skins later, you perpetrator *

02:35.489 --> 02:37.024
* I come tight with the beat
and all that *

02:37.057 --> 02:38.192
* So throw your hands
in the air *

02:38.226 --> 02:39.727
* Show me what you got there

02:39.760 --> 02:41.229
* 'Cause girls
just wanna have fun *

02:41.262 --> 02:42.663
* But deep inside my heart

02:42.696 --> 02:44.498
* I know girls
just wanna have funds *

02:44.532 --> 02:46.334
* You, yeah, you make me go...

02:46.367 --> 02:49.337
(snoring)

02:49.370 --> 02:52.306
(clanging)

02:52.340 --> 02:54.007
(garbage truck beeping)
(dog barking)

02:54.041 --> 02:57.245
(groans)

02:57.278 --> 02:59.713
(brakes hissing)

03:21.235 --> 03:22.703
(sizzling)

03:22.736 --> 03:26.307
(faint ringing)
(muffled conversation)

03:31.211 --> 03:33.614
(panting)

03:48.562 --> 03:53.701
I made my special
heart pancakes.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.103
What kind
of jank-ass hearts are these?

03:56.136 --> 03:58.038
(chuckles)
That one looks
like a butt.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.308
Sorry. It was
kind of a rough night.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.744
But, um, this afternoon,
I-I finally have my consultation

04:03.777 --> 04:05.646
with the chief of staff
at the VA,

04:05.679 --> 04:07.648
and I think...
LINDSAY: Yeah, chiefs'll
do that sometimes.

04:07.681 --> 04:11.051
Hey, can I get some sticky sauce
for these pan-butts or what?

04:11.084 --> 04:12.886
It turns out, in World War I,
the official term

04:12.920 --> 04:15.055
for "PTSD" was "cowardice,"

04:15.088 --> 04:17.057
and you were
shot for it.
GRETCHEN: That is interesting.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.760
LINDSAY:
How are you holding up, Jimmy?

04:19.793 --> 04:21.729
(muffled):
When my guinea pig died,
I couldn't jack off

04:21.762 --> 04:23.731
for, like, half a day.
GRETCHEN:
I'm telling you guys--

04:23.764 --> 04:25.733
false alarm.
He truly doesn't give a shit.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.168
(conversation continuing
indistinctly)

04:30.471 --> 04:32.840
(faint ringing)

04:38.278 --> 04:41.148
(ringing volume increases)

04:47.788 --> 04:49.657
(radio static)
(speaks indistinctly)

04:52.159 --> 04:54.462
(water running)
JIMMY:
Aw!

04:54.495 --> 04:56.096
It nearly
had it.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.197
(water running loudly)

04:57.230 --> 04:59.132
Oh, shit.

04:59.166 --> 05:01.535
LINDSAY:
...mommy classes Becca's
always yammering about.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.136
JIMMY:
Edgar? Edgar?

05:03.170 --> 05:05.606
Uh, yeah. What's up?
Big writing day

05:05.639 --> 05:07.875
ahead of me. I need you to get
all my usual writing snacks

05:07.908 --> 05:09.677
from the British
specialty store.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.345
Shrimp-flavored crisps,

05:11.379 --> 05:13.781
Wallington's choco-knockers,
tartar biscuits,

05:13.814 --> 05:16.183
kidney jerky, and then
all your standard candies--

05:16.216 --> 05:17.985
lemingtons, fluffingtons,
rum Christophers...

05:24.057 --> 05:27.395
(classical music playing
over speakers)

05:38.572 --> 05:41.375
(faint ringing)

05:41.409 --> 05:43.977
(register beeping)

05:44.011 --> 05:46.980
(breathing deeply)

05:47.014 --> 05:49.349
(indistinct chatter)

05:49.383 --> 05:51.785
(ringing volume increases)

05:56.857 --> 05:58.692
(breathing deeply)

05:58.726 --> 06:00.728
(ringing volume decreases)

06:08.936 --> 06:10.838
(indistinct chatter)

06:10.871 --> 06:12.706
(woman speaking indistinctly)

06:12.740 --> 06:14.475
I have eyes
on him right now.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.445
(faint ringing)

06:17.478 --> 06:19.613
Subject is
on the move.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.082
(ringing volume increases)
(indistinct chatter)

06:34.495 --> 06:37.297
(register beeping)

06:37.330 --> 06:39.733
(beeping quickens)
(indistinct chatter)

06:46.740 --> 06:48.709
CASHIER:
Can I help you?
(ringing stops)

06:48.742 --> 06:51.378
Sir?

06:51.411 --> 06:53.280
Sir?

06:54.782 --> 06:57.184
(classical music continues
playing over speakers)

07:02.322 --> 07:04.592
(beeping)

07:04.625 --> 07:07.094
A British flag balloon.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.662
How did you know?

07:08.696 --> 07:11.331
Oh, I pays attention
to my girl.

07:21.475 --> 07:23.076
Whoa.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.078
Edgar.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.080
Hey. Edgar.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.317
Edgar, look at me. No.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.985
Edgar...
I've been thinking
about you all day.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.654
I could barely sleep.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.422
Okay, you need your sleep.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.157
Aren't you supposed to have
your big meeting thingy

07:37.190 --> 07:39.126
with the head counselor person?
I was actually
thinking,

07:39.159 --> 07:41.128
instead, what if we
just hung out here all day,

07:41.161 --> 07:43.463
you know, just, like, laid
in bed and watched movies?

07:43.497 --> 07:45.432
Or... ignored movies.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.801
Edgar, stop!

07:47.835 --> 07:49.803
Why don't you
want to go?

07:49.837 --> 07:52.105
You've been waiting
to meet with her for months.
What if I go

07:52.139 --> 07:54.107
and this is my best last chance

07:54.141 --> 07:55.809
and they can't help me?

07:55.843 --> 07:57.444
Then we try something else.
What else?!

07:57.477 --> 07:59.780
I've tried booze, drugs,

07:59.813 --> 08:01.682
talk therapy, pills.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.450
If not for you, for me.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.052
I need you to try.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.754
Sometimes I see
you look at me...

08:08.021 --> 08:09.790
...and it kind of...

08:09.823 --> 08:11.291
it scares me.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.694
I'm sorry.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.696
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.698
I'm sorry.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.400
I don't need you to apologize.
I just need you to keep trying.

08:20.433 --> 08:24.037
You are brave and you're
smart and you're strong, okay?

08:24.071 --> 08:26.039
And remember,
when you go,

08:26.073 --> 08:28.742
you just have to be
your own advocate, okay?

08:28.776 --> 08:30.177
They can fix you,

08:30.210 --> 08:31.845
but you might have to fight
for it.

08:31.879 --> 08:35.248
This is the one time
to not follow the rules.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.017
It's their job to help you.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.525
(rhythmic creaking)

08:45.559 --> 08:48.896
Edgar, where are
your pre-moistened towelettes?

08:48.929 --> 08:51.164
I don't have any. Why?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.000
No reason.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.836
I might need one
in a few minutes.
(chuckles)

08:55.869 --> 08:57.705
GRETCHEN:
Hey, look, it's your...

08:57.738 --> 09:00.107
dumbass limey biscuit
and fag store.

09:00.140 --> 09:03.343
Um, Edgar, I thought
you said you couldn't get

09:03.376 --> 09:05.913
my writing snacks 'cause
the store was cordoned off

09:05.946 --> 09:07.414
due to police activity.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.516
I, uh... I-I guess
they caught the guy.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.451
(faint ringing)

09:19.927 --> 09:20.961
GRETCHEN:
Oh!

09:20.994 --> 09:23.030
Aah! Oh!

09:23.063 --> 09:24.865
Jesus!
You are lucky I didn't
just break my wang.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.133
GRETCHEN:
Oh,

09:26.166 --> 09:27.400
I broke a guy's
wang once.

09:27.434 --> 09:28.802
They never tell you

09:28.836 --> 09:30.704
how far back it
can and can't go.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.807
JIMMY: It's the sideways
that's really dangerous.

09:33.841 --> 09:36.443
Oi! Eyes forward, pervert.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.946
(ringing continues)

09:38.979 --> 09:40.814
(music starts playing)
Uh, excuse me,

09:40.848 --> 09:42.816
is this an audio tape?

09:42.850 --> 09:44.785
I didn't know
they still had those.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.287
I guess poor people still
need something to listen to.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.957
I like my tapes.
My brother gave me these.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.491
This is my favorite because

09:51.524 --> 09:52.893
it reminds...
Oh, look!

09:52.926 --> 09:55.395
He even has them
in a little tape case.

09:55.428 --> 09:58.098
Oh, my God,
are we in the Smithsonian?

09:58.131 --> 10:01.168
Do obese Midwesterners
gather around your car,

10:01.201 --> 10:03.570
pressing their
be-churroed faces

10:03.603 --> 10:05.272
at the glass
to marvel at your

10:05.305 --> 10:08.108
ancient relics from an
erstwhile time of low-fidelity

10:08.141 --> 10:11.611
and inability to fast forward
through songs quickly?

10:11.645 --> 10:13.681
(tires screech)
Agh!
Oh...

10:13.714 --> 10:17.350
I swear, this is by far the
worst Uber I have ever taken.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.653
* Like a feeling
that feels so...*

10:19.687 --> 10:22.522
Oh, I almost forgot--
give us your car booze.

10:22.555 --> 10:26.326
Guys, I... I really have to
get to my VA appointment.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.595
(groans)
(groans)
Fine, but when you're done

10:28.628 --> 10:31.431
with your stupid thing
you're giving us a ride home.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.002
(engine starts)

10:35.035 --> 10:38.972
* And you'll slide into a
something that's only tonight *

10:39.006 --> 10:41.208
*

10:41.241 --> 10:44.644
* Being something like a feeling
that feels so right... *

10:52.219 --> 10:54.988
Now... (exhales)

10:55.022 --> 10:57.557
Good.
(pats back)

10:57.590 --> 10:59.492
Boy, oh, boy,
son, I...

10:59.526 --> 11:01.228
You know, I really
got to congratulate you

11:01.261 --> 11:03.330
on your tenacity
and dedication

11:03.363 --> 11:05.733
to overcoming
your difficulties.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.901
You-you really... you
really are an inspiration.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.703
Overcoming?

11:09.737 --> 11:13.173
I'm, uh... Actually,
I'm-I'm not doing so well.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.708
Well, you got in to see me,

11:14.742 --> 11:17.177
and that takes
grit and determination.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.645
Sometimes my own grandchildren

11:18.678 --> 11:20.380
have to make an appointment
to see me.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.182
Well, thanks.

11:22.215 --> 11:25.318
But should it take grit
and determination to get help?

11:25.352 --> 11:26.486
Exactly.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.522
Edgar, you are exactly right.

11:29.556 --> 11:32.025
Believe you me, when I think
of the difficulties

11:32.059 --> 11:33.761
that our chronic underfunding

11:33.794 --> 11:35.495
has meant for our patients,

11:35.528 --> 11:37.264
it just makes my blood boil.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.100
We are making strides, though.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.402
We have a plan
to stop being fax dependent

11:42.435 --> 11:44.071
before the next war.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.306
Wait, you guys know
when the next war is?

11:47.574 --> 11:49.042
No.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.779
(giggling softly)
Oh...

11:51.812 --> 11:53.180
I got you!

11:53.213 --> 11:56.116
(both laughing)

11:56.149 --> 11:58.285
I like you.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.519
I really like you.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.221
I really like you.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.624
Oh, that's so nice.
You know what?

12:04.657 --> 12:07.060
What the heck.
I am prepared

12:07.094 --> 12:10.898
to offer you ten sessions
in our virtual reality trainer.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.533
They actually
build a video game

12:13.566 --> 12:16.703
out of your trauma.
It's really so fun.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.406
But scary, of course.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.474
But,
more importantly,

12:21.508 --> 12:23.476
it's shown real efficacy

12:23.510 --> 12:26.780
in ameliorating
battlefield trauma of your type.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.215
Well, I-I know about that.
Yeah?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.583
But I-I was told
that study was full up.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.086
(whispers):
It's our little secret.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.622
Shh.
Wow.

12:35.655 --> 12:38.325
Okay. Thank you.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.860
Mm.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.096
But I-I guess
I don't understand--

12:43.130 --> 12:45.799
um, what if I hadn't kept asking

12:45.833 --> 12:48.068
and asking?
Let's get you
signed up, shall we?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.769
Okay.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.105
So, you are taking Paxil,

12:52.139 --> 12:54.107
Ambien, Chlordia...

12:54.141 --> 12:55.608
11 different medications,
actually.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.010
Well, I take 15,

12:57.044 --> 12:59.279
and I never went to war.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.548
Getting old: don't do it.
(laughs)

13:03.150 --> 13:05.418
Yeah, but actually,
I stopped taking those.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.822
Oh, dear. Which ones?

13:08.856 --> 13:10.891
All of them.
I stopped them all.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.162
Okay.

13:15.195 --> 13:16.429
So...

13:16.463 --> 13:18.431
when you are back

13:18.465 --> 13:20.333
on the full course

13:20.367 --> 13:21.768
of your prescribed treatment,

13:21.801 --> 13:23.603
then we can revisit

13:23.636 --> 13:25.605
whether we can
locate a place for you

13:25.638 --> 13:27.841
in one of our
alternative programs.
Yeah, but they

13:27.875 --> 13:29.843
were not working for me,
and this might.

13:29.877 --> 13:32.479
If you're hostile
to one of our treatments,

13:32.512 --> 13:34.681
how can I offer you another?

13:34.714 --> 13:37.050
Especially when our budget
is limited,

13:37.084 --> 13:39.186
and there's so many deserving
men and women?

13:39.219 --> 13:41.688
No, I'm-I'm not hostile,
I'm... Okay? I just...

13:41.721 --> 13:43.190
I don't like the side effects.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.392
They make me
feel blotchy.

13:45.425 --> 13:48.361
Okay? I-It's just-it's just
turning down the volume.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.064
It... It's not living.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.069
From where I sit...

13:56.103 --> 13:59.106
we seem to be at an impasse.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.247
(sniffles)

14:07.280 --> 14:08.748
No, I'm not leaving.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.217
(sighs)
You're gonna
help me.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.552
It's the only reason you exist:

14:12.585 --> 14:14.021
to help us.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.422
And no, no,

14:15.455 --> 14:16.689
it's not enough to be fed

14:16.723 --> 14:18.258
a one size fits all cocktail

14:18.291 --> 14:19.927
of shut up pills.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.362
Oh, if we had shut up pills,

14:22.395 --> 14:25.098
we would have prescribed them
to you by now.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.202
Oh, okay.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.604
Okay. Aah!

14:32.772 --> 14:34.041
(grunts)

14:36.543 --> 14:38.545
Aah!

14:42.615 --> 14:44.651
Are you done?

14:47.087 --> 14:49.122
Okay.
You feel free

14:49.156 --> 14:50.790
to make another
appointment

14:50.823 --> 14:52.092
once you're
back on your

14:52.125 --> 14:53.626
prescribed medication.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.162
Okay, hon?

15:15.648 --> 15:17.951
(distorted, sluggish):
* Though you know, yeah...

15:17.985 --> 15:20.420
(faint ringing)

15:22.322 --> 15:23.623
(music stops)

15:23.656 --> 15:26.493
(music starts again,
more distorted)

15:32.765 --> 15:35.835
(ringing continues)

15:35.868 --> 15:37.737
Oh, sh...

15:37.770 --> 15:40.473
* We won't get another soul

15:40.507 --> 15:43.343
* Just to see this night

15:43.376 --> 15:44.911
(helicopter blades whirring)

15:44.944 --> 15:46.679
* And you'll slide into
a something... *

15:46.713 --> 15:48.281
(ringing continuing)

15:56.189 --> 15:59.926
(distorted music plays)

15:59.959 --> 16:01.194
(honking)

16:01.228 --> 16:02.629
* We're still, we're still...

16:02.662 --> 16:04.131
(gasps)

16:06.166 --> 16:07.867
(music distorts, slows)

16:07.900 --> 16:10.270
(ringing continuing)

16:10.303 --> 16:12.672
Shit.
(tires screech)

16:12.705 --> 16:14.707
(horn honks)

16:17.710 --> 16:20.013
* I know something
like a feeling *

16:20.047 --> 16:22.715
* That feels so right

16:22.749 --> 16:23.750
* Gonna...
(music stops)

16:41.101 --> 16:43.103
(phone rings)

16:48.041 --> 16:49.709
Hey, Jimmy.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.045
We're ready to go.
And I sincerely hope

16:52.079 --> 16:53.713
you've got our car booze.

16:53.746 --> 16:56.015
A majority of your rating
rests on this.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.984
Uh, sorry, I-I can't come.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.753
My, um... my car broke down.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.389
Oh, well, that's not a surprise,

17:02.422 --> 17:05.858
piece of shit with no
auxiliary plug or car booze.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.160
(click, dial tone)

17:07.194 --> 17:09.829
(phone beeps off)

17:09.862 --> 17:11.864
(phone buzzing)

17:18.571 --> 17:20.573
(horns honking)

17:39.826 --> 17:42.629
(vehicles whooshing by)

17:48.601 --> 17:51.138
(crying)

17:56.176 --> 17:58.111
(sniffles)

18:03.150 --> 18:05.585
(sighs)

18:07.320 --> 18:09.889
(engines revving)

18:09.922 --> 18:12.292
*

18:25.972 --> 18:28.141
(sighs)

18:45.858 --> 18:48.094
(laughs)

18:48.127 --> 18:50.096
MAN:
Goddamn it!

18:50.129 --> 18:54.301
Cut! Hey, man! Hey! Can you
not just pick up our prop?

18:54.334 --> 18:56.936
We're gonna have
to go again.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.172
Oh, sorry. I-I didn't notice
you were...
What? You just

18:59.206 --> 19:01.341
thought a paper boat was sailing
down the river on its own?

19:01.374 --> 19:03.343
I don't know.

19:03.376 --> 19:04.844
Don't talk to me that way!

19:04.877 --> 19:06.446
Sorry.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.815
We're making this silent short
for a class,

19:08.848 --> 19:10.650
and we don't have tons of film.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.486
I don't understand why we
have to shoot on film anyway.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.489
I mean, I bought myself a Red
with my bar mitzvah money.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.891
Anyway...

19:18.925 --> 19:21.728
He has a good look, huh?

19:21.761 --> 19:23.496
What?

19:28.568 --> 19:31.003
(crickets chirping)

19:35.542 --> 19:37.477
Shit!

19:37.510 --> 19:39.979
Hey, uh, that's my car.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.682
Hello. I'm here.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.251
(dog barking)
Oh...!

19:44.284 --> 19:45.652
(barking)

19:45.685 --> 19:47.086
(chains jingle,
barking continues)

19:47.119 --> 19:49.188
Hey. Hey.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.758
(taps car)
It's my car. I'm here.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.660
I'm just doing
my job.
Oh, I know. I know.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.762
I'm sorry.
I, uh... I-I ran out of gas.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.163
You can't just leave

19:57.196 --> 19:59.366
your car here. Sign?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.836
And you got plenty of gas.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.838
Look, I had to pull over.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.241
I'm... I've been, um...

20:10.209 --> 20:11.778
I'm having a tough day.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.280
I drive a tow truck.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.214
Everybody's having a tough day.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.119
Please?

20:20.152 --> 20:21.921
You a vet?

20:23.122 --> 20:25.392
What? How did...?

20:25.425 --> 20:27.294
Your paperwork
on the seat of your car.

20:32.465 --> 20:34.901
(lighter clicks open, shuts)

20:37.003 --> 20:38.237
Dreams?

20:38.271 --> 20:40.206
Some real bad ones.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.109
Hypervigilance?
I saw a sniper
on the overpass.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.111
IEDs in the trash?

20:45.144 --> 20:48.481
Yes! Roadside trash
is the worst.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.617
Why can't they just
throw it away?

20:50.650 --> 20:53.085
Suicidal thoughts?

20:55.154 --> 20:57.123
You know the stats?

20:57.156 --> 20:59.559
22 every day.

20:59.592 --> 21:03.162
Though, in truth, there
are some Vietnam dudes

21:03.195 --> 21:05.798
that are jacking up
our numbers, but still.

21:05.832 --> 21:09.602
I thought starting today,
things would get better.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.738
But they don't give a shit.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.806
Here's what you
got to understand.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.442
They're not evil.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.276
None of 'em are.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.078
The military's job

21:19.111 --> 21:21.113
is to sand down our humanity
just enough

21:21.147 --> 21:22.849
to where we can take a life.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.250
That's it.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.985
Afterwards, some
totally separate branch

21:26.018 --> 21:27.454
gets to deal with

21:27.487 --> 21:29.822
all these purposely broken
motherfuckers.

21:29.856 --> 21:33.092
Not only is that impossible
with the resources,

21:33.125 --> 21:35.328
that's just impossible, period.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.530
Yeah, well, then,
what are we supposed to do?

21:37.564 --> 21:39.632
Not wait for someone
to help you.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.368
Figure out
what works.
(dog whines gently)

21:41.401 --> 21:43.836
My man Carter--
he hunts all the time.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.605
This big chopper
pilot I know...

21:45.638 --> 21:47.340
(laughs)

21:47.374 --> 21:49.476
...he goes to yoga.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.178
And we make fun of him,
but it seems to work.
(laughs)

21:52.211 --> 21:53.780
(laughter)

21:53.813 --> 21:56.048
Jorge hikes the
PCT once a year.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.050
I got this companion dog.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.653
I wanted a big,
mean, dude,

22:00.687 --> 22:04.657
but the organization gave
me this little scrub.
Mm.

22:04.691 --> 22:09.028
He saved my life-- this guy.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.664
This other bro I know
locks himself in his bedroom

22:11.698 --> 22:14.033
and stabs his
closet door.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.235
I mean, he's not
getting his deposit back,

22:16.268 --> 22:19.205
but once the rage
passes, he's fine.

22:19.238 --> 22:22.975
I know you don't want
to hear this,

22:23.009 --> 22:26.178
but the minute you stop looking
for someone else to cure you,

22:26.212 --> 22:27.880
maybe you start living again.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.721
* So let's not just be
this one night *

22:34.754 --> 22:37.323
* Slowly slide
into a something *

22:37.356 --> 22:39.726
* That's nothing despite

22:39.759 --> 22:45.064
* Being something like
a feeling that feels so right *

22:46.766 --> 22:50.269
* I can't let it go

22:50.302 --> 22:53.506
* I have to find you

22:53.540 --> 22:57.176
* Cannot find you, girl

22:57.209 --> 23:00.680
* I run through the streets

23:00.713 --> 23:04.517
* My mind is racing

23:04.551 --> 23:07.454
* Hands are shaking, yeah...

23:07.487 --> 23:10.022
(whooping)

23:10.056 --> 23:11.724
Dude! Don't do that!

23:11.758 --> 23:13.192
Oh, uh...

23:13.225 --> 23:15.562
Sorry!

23:15.595 --> 23:20.700
Sorry. I am s... sorry.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.469
* Feels so right

23:22.502 --> 23:27.874
* I won't let you go
after just one more night *

23:27.907 --> 23:30.577
* Slowly slide into a nothing

23:30.610 --> 23:33.980
* That's something despite

23:34.013 --> 23:38.485
* Being something like a feeling
that feels so right *

23:38.518 --> 23:41.053
* I said it's some day...
* Something like a feeling *

23:41.087 --> 23:43.923
* That feels so right *
* Something like a feeling

23:43.956 --> 23:48.795
* I won't let you go
after just one more night *
* I won't let you go

23:48.828 --> 23:51.664
(laughing)
* Slowly slide into a nothing

23:51.698 --> 23:55.267
* That's something despite

23:55.301 --> 23:59.271
* Being something like a feeling
that feels so right *

23:59.305 --> 24:02.775
* I said something
like a feeling *

24:02.809 --> 24:07.213
* That feels for night.

24:13.052 --> 24:17.957

dramatic music)

24:36.543 --> 24:38.578
(piano plays dramatic music)

24:55.562 --> 24:57.096

playing upbeat song)
