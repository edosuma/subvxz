00:36.760 --> 00:40.400
Hi, Mr. Sutton? We have some great news.

00:40.480 --> 00:42.840
Some great news just for you.

00:42.920 --> 00:46.120
Is this is a God thing? I don't believe
in God. I haven't for some time.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.360
If you're collecting for God,
I wouldn't bother.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.160
No, it's not that.

01:55.880 --> 01:57.840
-Where is he?
-I lost him.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.880
What do you mean, lost him?

02:01.960 --> 02:04.080
-You had one job!
-I didn't see you trying to run.

02:11.960 --> 02:16.000


02:16.080 --> 02:20.960


02:21.040 --> 02:26.520


02:26.600 --> 02:30.600


02:30.680 --> 02:33.920


02:34.000 --> 02:36.160


02:36.240 --> 02:38.760


02:38.840 --> 02:40.840


02:40.920 --> 02:42.240


02:42.320 --> 02:47.080


02:48.400 --> 02:51.280
<i>This is Harry Sutton.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

02:52.880 --> 02:54.680


02:54.760 --> 02:56.360
-
-Cassie?

02:58.560 --> 02:59.520
Cassie, stop!

03:04.800 --> 03:05.960


03:07.480 --> 03:08.760
Detective Broome?

03:09.560 --> 03:10.400
Cassie.

03:12.160 --> 03:15.040
-Harry's not here yet.
-I can't believe you're here.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.880
I won't talk without Harry.

03:17.760 --> 03:18.600
Right.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.680
Look, I'll tell you everything,
but can we just find him first?

03:22.760 --> 03:24.040
Okay.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.760


03:29.960 --> 03:30.800
Harry!

03:36.880 --> 03:38.520
Sorry.

03:38.600 --> 03:39.840
Wh…

03:39.920 --> 03:42.160
-Are you okay?
-Come in, come in, come in, come in.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.480
Broome, sorry.

03:50.160 --> 03:51.040


03:51.120 --> 03:52.200
My imagination.

03:54.640 --> 03:55.960
Coffee? Do you want coffee?

04:03.240 --> 04:05.040
Let me make myself very clear.

04:06.560 --> 04:07.840
This is a one-time thing.

04:09.240 --> 04:12.320
I'm only here
because I have to keep my family safe.

04:14.040 --> 04:16.640
I'll tell you what I know
about that night with Stewart.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.720
And then I'm going to disappear again.

04:21.120 --> 04:22.840
And you will not try to contact me.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.840
Do we understand each other?

04:32.360 --> 04:33.200
Okay.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.520
We have an agreement.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.880
Go ahead. I'm right here.

04:45.760 --> 04:47.920
I don't know where Stewart Green is.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.000
When you both vanished,
you two were seeing each other, right?

04:52.080 --> 04:55.560
We weren't seeing each other.
He was obsessed with me.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.640
Stewart Green was a psychopath.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.520
Yeah.

05:03.480 --> 05:06.120
I thought he was a good guy too. At first.

05:07.880 --> 05:08.840
But I was wrong.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.720
He stalked me.

05:15.240 --> 05:18.040
And he beat me,
and he threatened to kill me.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.000
He was crazy.

05:23.720 --> 05:24.560
What happened?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.880
I started seeing someone new.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.120
And Stewart didn't like it.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.400
This someone…

05:40.880 --> 05:41.720
Ray Levine?

05:46.040 --> 05:47.480
His name doesn't matter.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.440
What did Stewart do
when he heard about your new someone?

05:56.880 --> 05:58.120
He made my life hell.

05:59.960 --> 06:03.440
So I threatened to tell his wife
if he kept coming after me,

06:03.960 --> 06:05.760
but that just made him more aggressive.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.600
You could have come to me
or another police officer.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.920
What would the police
have done, Detective?

06:13.000 --> 06:16.600
Believed the stripper
over the beloved family man?

06:19.040 --> 06:20.480
Hm.

06:21.520 --> 06:22.640
So that night,

06:23.880 --> 06:25.320
the night I disappeared,

06:27.120 --> 06:30.400
I went up to the old ruins
by Vipers, just…

06:32.600 --> 06:35.400
just to get away from everyone
and everything, just for a minute.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.280
But when I got there…

06:40.560 --> 06:42.440
…I saw a body covered in blood.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.240
It was Stewart.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.280
He was dead?

06:50.600 --> 06:51.840
He looked dead.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.080
I didn't get close enough
to check for a heartbeat.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.760
Why didn't you call the police?

06:58.440 --> 07:02.720
Because I knew how it looked.
I hated this man. I'd be a suspect.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.440
-You could have called it in anonymously.
-Yeah, I could. I could have.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.120
But I didn't.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.240
I ran.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.320
I changed my name.

07:13.240 --> 07:14.680
I started a new life.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.560
And I haven't been Cassie since.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.200
Did you ever tell anyone what you saw?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Only you.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.600
Now.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.160
And Ray Levine?

07:35.840 --> 07:36.800
Broome.

07:41.800 --> 07:46.960
This, uh… someone you were seeing,
where was he at this time?

07:47.560 --> 07:48.680
I don't know.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.440
'Cause I never saw him again.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.120
Did he know Stewart abused you?

07:57.280 --> 07:58.120
No.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.880
-Where did you go from there?
-Irrelevant.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.240
We have a deal.

08:12.080 --> 08:16.400
You could have stayed hidden.
Kept your new life safe. Why come back?

08:19.080 --> 08:21.120
Because somebody saw Stewart recently.

08:23.040 --> 08:23.880
Who?

08:24.800 --> 08:29.480
Someone I trust. I won't say who.
I promised not to involve them.

08:30.080 --> 08:33.120
-When did this happen?
-Last week at Vipers.

08:34.600 --> 08:35.480
So…

08:37.480 --> 08:38.840
so I went to Stewart's house.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.120
I could tell there was something off.
I could feel it.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.200
-Like maybe he was living in the basement.
-Did you break into his house?

08:47.280 --> 08:48.920
No, I…

08:49.000 --> 08:52.320
-Well, the second time, technically yes.
-Uh, that was my idea, Broome.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.680
There is a door

08:56.720 --> 08:58.200
at the back of the basement.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.400
His wife, she's hiding something in there.

09:09.280 --> 09:10.840
Are you telling me everything?

09:10.920 --> 09:13.280
I can't help you
unless I have the full picture.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.680
A man with a shaved head
gave this to my 11-year-old son.

09:28.680 --> 09:29.600
So you have a kid?

09:42.200 --> 09:43.840
Okay, so this isn't good.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.320
Look, I will do everything I can
to protect you and your son.

09:55.200 --> 09:56.680
You won't go near my son.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.240
-Ray?
-I'm here.

10:24.880 --> 10:28.520
-<i>You have done 372 steps.</i>
-Thanks for coming, mate.

10:28.600 --> 10:29.560
You all right there?

10:29.640 --> 10:31.400
-<i> Your daily target…</i>
-Shh. Just, uh…

10:31.480 --> 10:33.360
Just logging the walk over
on my fitness app.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.920
-<i> Well-done.</i>
-How's that going?

10:35.000 --> 10:35.840
Good.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.680
Put on 20 pounds.

10:39.560 --> 10:40.920
Oh God.

10:41.640 --> 10:43.840
Hey, mate, I'm sorry to hear about Cassie.

10:45.960 --> 10:47.720
I still hate her
for what she put you through.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.520
You know, Team Ray all the way.

10:52.600 --> 10:55.360
Yeah, it's been a strange 24 hours.

10:56.680 --> 10:57.600
Strange?

10:57.680 --> 11:00.720
Yeah, it's just… I don't know.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.200
Somethin' about all this
just doesn't feel… real.

11:07.520 --> 11:08.840
Can you do me a favor?

11:10.080 --> 11:12.440
Can you track down
a number plate for me with your…

11:12.520 --> 11:13.800
…Fester ways?

11:15.240 --> 11:16.080
What now?

11:17.880 --> 11:21.120
I was in the woods earlier,
and I saw these two teenage girls--

11:21.200 --> 11:22.320
I already hate this.

11:22.400 --> 11:27.120
And I'm pretty sure
one of them was there that night at Vipers

11:27.200 --> 11:29.080
with that kid who disappeared.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.880
Mate, this could be my mum
for all we know.

11:35.640 --> 11:37.080
Look, I know it's not clear,

11:37.160 --> 11:40.520
but when I approached her,
she and her friend, they…

11:41.360 --> 11:44.280
they got really scared
and… and sprinted away.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.360
Very incriminating.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.640
Yeah, very incriminating.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.960
Why would two teenage girls run away

11:52.040 --> 11:54.280
from a strange man
chasing them in the woods?

11:54.360 --> 11:57.320
I got a picture of the number plate.
Can you just track it for me?

11:58.480 --> 12:01.320
Of course, darling.
I'll help you stalk these children.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.640
God, stop.

12:05.680 --> 12:07.600
<i>So Cassie thought</i>
<i>Stewart Green was dead?</i>

12:09.120 --> 12:09.960
Yeah.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.320
But here's the thing.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.160
<i>She then said that someone</i>
<i>saw Stewart Green last week.</i>

12:15.240 --> 12:17.760
Right. So is he dead or not?
Do you believe her?

12:17.840 --> 12:19.720
<i> Do I believe</i>
<i>he's an abusive psychopath?</i>

12:19.800 --> 12:20.960
<i>Yeah, I think I do now.</i>

12:21.040 --> 12:24.240
<i>But there's more to it</i>
<i>than what she's saying, I'm telling you.</i>

12:24.960 --> 12:28.960
The blood at the ruins,
it's not Carlton's. It's Guy Tatum's.

13:08.320 --> 13:10.000
Good to see ya.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.280
It's probably gonna be
the last time in a while.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.520
Goodbye visit, is it?

13:17.040 --> 13:17.880
It's got to be.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.040
Ah, that's a shame.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.680
You gotta do what you gotta do.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.920
-You okay, Lorraine?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.000
How about you? How's the family?

13:35.080 --> 13:37.040
Know what the worst thing
about being a parent is?

13:37.120 --> 13:37.960
Dirty nappies.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.160
No, I mean now. Now they're older.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.960
My happiness is
totally dependent on theirs.

13:45.040 --> 13:48.120
I mean, I used to be a functioning adult
with my own emotions.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.680
Do you know what that sounds like?

13:51.640 --> 13:54.040
-What?
-An abusive relationship.

13:55.880 --> 13:59.080
-That's a little bit harsh, Lorraine.
-Yeah, probably.

14:07.400 --> 14:10.000
-Don't go there, Cassie.
-What?

14:10.080 --> 14:12.280
You think I don't know
whose seat that was?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.080
Have you seen him?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.200
Yeah. Yeah, briefly.

14:25.520 --> 14:29.600
And I, uh… I may have told him
that you were dead.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.280
-What?
-I panicked. It just happened.

14:33.360 --> 14:37.520
-Lorraine, what the hell?
-What? Look at you. Look at your family.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.360
I didn't even say I wanted to see him.
I just glanced at his seat,

14:40.440 --> 14:42.920
and then you dropped
a "I told him you were dead" on me.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.160
I know we haven't seen each other for
a long time, but I know you inside out.

14:48.000 --> 14:51.360
But, hey, listen, I'm not gonna judge you.
Not gonna judge you.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.280
You wanna mess up your life? That's fine.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.360
He's still working as a photographer.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.320
If you can call it that.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.040
-He's not into porn, is he?
-No, sweetie.

15:02.120 --> 15:05.240
Porn is way classier
than what Ray's doing.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.600
What's he doing?

15:10.160 --> 15:12.240
Paparazzi for hire?

15:13.200 --> 15:16.080
It's exactly what you think it is
but just a little bit sadder.

15:53.760 --> 15:56.800
Megs… where have you been?

15:58.400 --> 15:59.240
Here.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.320
I just got up for a pee.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.760
Liar.

16:07.840 --> 16:08.680
What?

16:12.160 --> 16:13.120
Dave?

16:37.920 --> 16:40.840
Can you look into those for me?
EXIF info, photoshopping.

16:40.920 --> 16:42.760
-You know the drill.
-On it, love.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.200
If what Cassie said was true
and Stewart Green really is back

17:01.280 --> 17:05.480
and he's this violent psycho,
could he have done this?

17:07.080 --> 17:08.160
It's a big if.

17:08.240 --> 17:11.640
You know, there is someone
who knows both Stewart and Guy.

17:12.480 --> 17:15.400
I think we need to have
a conversation with Ray Levine.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.080
Yeah. Let's start with people
we know are definitely alive.

17:23.120 --> 17:24.760
Mind if I grab a quick sandwich?

17:24.840 --> 17:28.040
Seamus had diarrhea all over
the changing table, and I forgot to eat.

17:28.120 --> 17:32.160
Who even knew it was possible
to forget to eat? It went in his ears.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.040
Does having a child throw all guidelines

17:34.120 --> 17:35.920
for appropriate conversation
out of the window?

17:36.560 --> 17:37.400
Back in two.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.320
Egg and cheese for me, please.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.640
No.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.880
<i>Dr. Peters, please call Dr…</i>

18:08.960 --> 18:12.200
<i> Keep it short.</i>
<i>No one wants to hear your podcast.</i>

18:12.280 --> 18:14.400
-Short it is.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.680
I like you a lot.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.080
I wish we'd started this sooner. Um…

18:22.200 --> 18:24.920
I want to be with you,
if that's what you'd like.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.400
The unabridged version is, um,

18:28.760 --> 18:30.200
longer, uh,

18:31.080 --> 18:32.600
but that's the gist of it.

18:32.680 --> 18:33.520
Um…

18:34.080 --> 18:37.400
Talk soon. Bye, Lorraine.
Oh! It's DS Broome, by the way.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.520
-Aye, aye.
-What?

18:44.040 --> 18:46.840
You're looking like my dog does
when he's pissed on my carpet.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.000
-You're annoying.

19:13.760 --> 19:14.880
Hello.

19:15.480 --> 19:16.440
Detective.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.080
-And?
-Girl detective.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.400
Can we come in? Have a quick chat?

19:22.720 --> 19:23.720
Yeah, sure.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.080
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.840
Guy Tatum's partner says he was
out with you the night he disappeared.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.080
-Can you tell us about that?
-Uh… Yeah.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.560
We went out drinking
and then…

19:40.440 --> 19:42.520
…somehow ended up getting separated.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.480
I just assumed he'd made his own way home.

19:46.520 --> 19:49.200
But then Simona came by
looking for him and…

19:50.560 --> 19:52.480
It's awful, what happened.

19:54.640 --> 19:55.760
Where were you drinking?

19:56.360 --> 19:59.680
Wh… where? Just at the Weak Signal
on the high street.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.360
Oh, but then I… I dropped him at Vipers
because he wanted to stay out.

20:07.760 --> 20:08.840
These are good, eh?

20:08.920 --> 20:10.080
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.520
This one here, um…

20:13.600 --> 20:15.680
Uh, there's a few of her, actually.

20:16.800 --> 20:17.640
That's Cassie, yeah?

20:18.880 --> 20:20.120
Mm-hmm.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.040
So I'm guessing no hard feelings

20:22.120 --> 20:24.400
about the whole running off
with another man thing?

20:24.480 --> 20:26.960
Oh, that was just speculation.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.880
No, yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.320
What do you think did happen?

20:39.360 --> 20:42.040
I would love to know
the answer to that myself.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.120
-You seen Stewart Green since?
-What? Of course not. Why?

20:55.640 --> 20:56.480
Oh…

20:57.040 --> 20:59.640
Just rumors that, uh…
he was seen around town,

20:59.720 --> 21:02.800
but maybe it's just more… speculation.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.840
What about Cassie? Have you seen her?

21:08.920 --> 21:10.000
No.

21:10.760 --> 21:11.800
Since that night?

21:13.720 --> 21:15.080
What camera do you use?

21:15.680 --> 21:18.120
I'm asking 'cause my husband's
just started to dabble.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.480
A Nikon D4.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.680
Oh, It might as well be a Pokémon
for all I know.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.200
Is that what that is?

21:27.280 --> 21:31.320
Oh, no, this is just some old Canon
that I'm borrowing for a…

21:31.920 --> 21:34.720
Sorry, I… I really do need to get to work.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.560
Uh, I don't think
I've got any more information for you.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.760
I'm Simona's friend.
I didn't really know Guy that well at all.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.600
Yeah, well, here, um,

21:44.120 --> 21:47.720
why don't you take my card, uh,
in case you think of anything else?

21:51.960 --> 21:53.200
Kayleigh!

22:06.680 --> 22:09.120
-Oh no!
-Turn it up.

22:18.000 --> 22:18.880
Jordan!

22:18.960 --> 22:21.440
Jordan, put down my underwear.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.760
-Never make me say that sentence again.
-Dad, he's being absolutely horrible.

22:24.840 --> 22:28.360
-We've been working on this for so long.
-It's one of the most complicated dances.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.080
-He keeps jumping in the video.
-Jordan!

22:31.120 --> 22:36.040
Oh! We're having a dance party.
This is the one you showed me, yeah?

22:36.120 --> 22:38.880
-All right, go!

22:38.960 --> 22:40.680
-You're actually kind of good.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.480
"Actually kind of good."
High praise for the old lady.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.440
No, don't mess it up, Dad. No, no, no.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.800
-Old people dancing over here.

22:47.880 --> 22:50.000
This is gonna be amazing!

23:01.240 --> 23:02.440
Plates…

23:06.520 --> 23:07.360
Harry?

23:10.560 --> 23:13.360
-I'm so sorry. I just wanted to--
-What are you doing here?

23:13.880 --> 23:16.640
-I just wanted a glimpse of the life--
-How did you get my address?

23:17.360 --> 23:20.080
At Stewart Green's,
I looked inside your glove compartment.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.880
It's written on your registration.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.160
-I know.
-Megan, you good?

23:25.040 --> 23:27.320
Yeah, great. Just, um…

23:27.400 --> 23:30.640
I'll just say hi and leave, I promise.
Hi! Nice to meet you.

23:30.720 --> 23:32.560
I'm just on my way out, so…

23:32.640 --> 23:33.520
Dave,

23:34.600 --> 23:35.680
this is Harry.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.760
My Spanish teacher from college.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.760
Yes, I'm… I'm one of those teachers

23:41.840 --> 23:44.600
who always insisted
on being called by my first name.

23:44.680 --> 23:45.640
The cool ones.

23:45.720 --> 23:48.000
Uh, lovely house you've got.
Love your garden.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.320
Uh, great to meet you.

23:49.400 --> 23:52.440
Do you want to stay for brunch?
Megan never talks about college.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.320
I would love to hear
some embarrassing stories.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.240
Oh-ho! Harry can't stay.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.880
-He was just passing.
-Yeah. Thanks for the offer, though.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.480
Please. If anything, you'll be helping me.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.160
I bought enough to feed an army,

24:03.240 --> 24:05.720
and, uh, we're one short.
Mum's not coming.

24:06.560 --> 24:07.400
Oh.

24:11.280 --> 24:12.640
-Why not?
-Excellent.

24:12.720 --> 24:15.480
All right. Come in.
It'll be about 20 minutes or so.

24:17.280 --> 24:18.240
Behave.

24:20.760 --> 24:24.200
-Look, you mess up right there. It's a…

24:24.280 --> 24:26.920
-Mm, mm. And then… Yeah?
-Okay.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.240
-This is beautiful. Lovely house.
-Guys, this is Harry.

24:30.320 --> 24:34.720
-One of my old teachers from college.
-Hello, I'm very old and a teacher. Yes.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.200
Just call me Uncle Harry.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.960
This is Kayleigh, Laura,
and that's Jordan.

24:39.040 --> 24:41.040
Dad, you said
we wouldn't get bacon anymore.

24:41.120 --> 24:43.400
-Pigs are smarter than dogs.
-And tastier.

24:43.480 --> 24:46.840
Good for you, Jordan.
Your generation is gonna save the planet.

24:46.920 --> 24:49.240
-Thanks.
-And will leave more bacon for us.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.320
Mm-hmm.

24:50.400 --> 24:53.160
So, just want to say,
very nice to meet you all,

24:53.680 --> 24:57.360
and your mother
was my most favorite student.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.640
What subject did you teach?

25:00.400 --> 25:01.560
Uh, Spanish.

25:02.640 --> 25:04.520
My mum doesn't speak Spanish.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.080
Does she not?

25:08.000 --> 25:11.560
Well, this is what I told her.
<i>Si no lo usas, lo perderás.</i>

25:12.080 --> 25:15.560
She doesn't even know what that means.
"If you don't use it, you will lose it."

25:15.640 --> 25:18.320
-So thanks for ratting me out, Kayleigh.

25:19.720 --> 25:22.360
-I've gotta go. Bea's picking me up.
-But our dance.

25:22.440 --> 25:25.360
-Uh, I'm making brunch.
-It's fine. No problem. You can go.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.640
We'll see you later. Have a good time.

25:28.840 --> 25:29.800
<i>Adiós,</i> Kayleigh.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.960
I know that face.
Who's pissed you off this time?

25:33.040 --> 25:36.800
Some sketchy guy's over claiming to be
Mum's college Spanish teacher.

25:36.880 --> 25:39.760
I used to take Spanish.
You know how <i>pollo</i> is chicken?

25:39.840 --> 25:40.960
Guess what <i>polla</i> is.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.160
A girl chicken?

25:42.240 --> 25:45.680
Guess you're gonna have to look it up.
Make sure to search by image.

25:46.280 --> 25:48.080
Eww, Bea!

25:49.480 --> 25:51.080
So you two are dancers?

25:51.760 --> 25:53.640
Oh, no, it's just this app thing.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.960
I've just been trying to do it.
It's impossible. You'd be rubbish at it.

25:57.040 --> 25:58.720
-Well, let me have a go.

25:58.800 --> 26:03.160
No, I've seen these things on the…
on the windup gramophone records of my--

26:03.240 --> 26:05.040
-Show him.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.320
Oh, that's fast.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.080
-You gotta count us in.
-Three, two, one.

26:10.160 --> 26:14.160
-Left, right. Left, right, left.
-Okay.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.240
One, two, three, four.

26:17.560 --> 26:18.680
-One.
-One, two.

26:19.960 --> 26:22.000
-Am I working…
-Working it, Uncle Harry!

26:22.080 --> 26:23.880
-He's got some moves!
-That was so in sync.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.640
-No, there.
-Wow!

26:25.720 --> 26:26.560
Okay.

26:27.160 --> 26:28.000
Cheers.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.280
Let me know how you're doing, all right?

26:56.600 --> 26:57.720
I'll try and be good.

26:59.800 --> 27:00.960
I promise.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.000
-Okay.
-Thank you for today.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.360
Thank you.

27:51.360 --> 27:52.920
-How did you--
-I'm a policeman.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.480
I had your phone tracked.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.240
It's illegal. Don't tell anyone.

27:57.320 --> 27:59.560
It's a good job
you look like that, you know.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.600
It's terminal.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.120
Ah.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.280
I'm so sorry.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.280
I'm okay with it.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.040
I've had a good life.

28:29.200 --> 28:33.160
-How much time do we have?
-Oh, don't. You don't have to do this.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.360
I want to.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.840
I'm not gonna go away this time.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.240
You can't scare me off, Sweet Lorraine.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.000
Let me be there for you.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.720
Oh, God, my shift's gonna start
in a minute.

29:08.320 --> 29:09.520
Can I see you later?

29:10.160 --> 29:11.000
Yeah.

29:12.320 --> 29:13.520
Yeah, I'd like that.

29:15.240 --> 29:16.080
Very much.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.240
Mmm.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.520
Who's had my milk?

29:56.040 --> 30:00.520
I've got our photo guy. It's Ray Levine.
I clocked the printer he had in his flat.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.720
It was the one he used to print
the photos that were left anonymously.

30:03.800 --> 30:06.440
Printer? I didn't see a printer.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.320
Remember when it took you two weeks
to notice I'd got a fringe?

30:11.160 --> 30:12.600
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.080
Okay, let's bring him in.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.680
-Tie his legs first.
-Oh no.

30:38.360 --> 30:41.160
If you cooperate,
the pain will be kept at a minimum.

30:42.080 --> 30:46.000
Now, who's this witness of yours
regarding Carlton Flynn?

31:23.920 --> 31:24.760
<i>Hello?</i>

31:25.320 --> 31:28.280
Uh, hello. Who's this? Where's Harry?

31:28.920 --> 31:31.440
<i>This is Mr. Sutton's secretary.</i>
<i>He's with a client.</i>

31:31.520 --> 31:33.120
<i>Can I pass along a message?</i>

31:51.560 --> 31:53.280
You know you're not under arrest, Ray,

31:53.360 --> 31:57.000
but… why didn't you mention these
when we spoke earlier?

31:59.320 --> 32:00.800
Didn't come up.

32:06.760 --> 32:10.000
All right. Yes, I… sent these.

32:11.360 --> 32:13.960
But it was for no other reason
than to help out.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.080
And when did you take these photographs?

32:20.040 --> 32:23.720
The one of the missing boy, last… Friday.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.440
The blood on Monday.

32:28.320 --> 32:29.840
So, just to confirm,

32:30.600 --> 32:34.840
you took this photograph of Carlton Flynn
on April the 16th, 2021,

32:34.920 --> 32:38.640
the same night
as Guy Tatum was last seen alive by you.

32:38.720 --> 32:40.040
Have I got that right?

32:43.280 --> 32:45.160
This is an opportunity for you, Ray,

32:45.240 --> 32:48.720
to tell us everything that happened
on the night of April the 16th.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.600
Everything.

32:52.520 --> 32:56.320
Even if it's something
you think you've already told us.

33:02.520 --> 33:06.920
That night, we…
Guy and me, we went out for drinks.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.160
We started at mine for a few beers

33:09.240 --> 33:11.600
then ended up at the Weak Signal,
like I said.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.160
-Come on!
-Yes, soldier!

33:14.920 --> 33:19.840
And at a certain point, I went home
because I had to work early the next day.

33:20.840 --> 33:22.800
What time was this certain point?

33:24.120 --> 33:26.400
Ten, maybe 11.
I don't know.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.520
It was definitely before midnight.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.360
Guy wanted to stay out,

33:35.440 --> 33:38.520
and I knew that Vipers
always had a big party at Carnival.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.040
So I… I dropped him there, but that…

33:42.080 --> 33:44.840
that was the last time
that I saw or heard from him.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.240
How did he seem?

33:48.720 --> 33:50.000
Fine, uh…

33:52.480 --> 33:53.440
All right!

33:53.520 --> 33:56.360
A bit drunk
but not out of his tree or anything.

33:58.080 --> 33:58.960
Then what?

34:00.880 --> 34:02.600
Then I…

34:09.000 --> 34:13.680
I… I know the old ruins at the back
of Vipers. I often do landscapes.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.040
So I must have gone there
to get some shots in,

34:17.120 --> 34:18.800
and… and then I went home.

34:20.920 --> 34:24.720
I don't remember any…
anyone else being in the woods that night,

34:25.880 --> 34:28.560
until I went through the photos
the next day and…

34:30.560 --> 34:32.840
saw the news about this missing kid.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.240
Do you usually take
your three-grand camera

34:35.320 --> 34:36.480
on casual nights out?

34:37.120 --> 34:39.480
Uh, yeah, actually, I do.
I take it everywhere.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.640
-Well, I did.
-You did?

34:44.440 --> 34:47.480
I was mugged the morning after all this.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.120
They were after the camera,

34:50.200 --> 34:52.040
but I always upload
the photos to the cloud.

34:52.120 --> 34:53.800
So I was able to go through them,

34:53.880 --> 34:58.200
and… that's when I saw this… Carlton Flynn

34:58.280 --> 35:00.200
in one of them from the night before.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.120
And the blood?

35:03.200 --> 35:05.120
No, I, um…

35:06.400 --> 35:08.840
I went back to the woods myself to look.

35:11.680 --> 35:15.800
I don't know, I… I just thought
maybe this kid had had too much to drink

35:15.880 --> 35:19.280
and was just passed out there somewhere,
but then…

35:21.680 --> 35:25.080
I saw the blood and… took the photos

35:25.160 --> 35:27.760
and got them to you
immediately after that.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.560
The blood was Guy's, by the way.
Not Carlton's.

35:33.520 --> 35:37.600
Was Guy Tatum with you in the woods
when you took this photograph of Carlton?

35:38.480 --> 35:42.040
No. Uh, sorry, the blood was Guy's?

35:43.680 --> 35:44.760
Hmm.

35:45.800 --> 35:50.040
So you said you, uh, sent in the photos
to help, and… and it's been a great help.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.440
Thanks for that.

35:52.640 --> 35:53.960
Uh, yeah, yeah, of course.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.720
But why send them in anonymously?

35:56.800 --> 35:59.040
That's, um…

35:59.880 --> 36:02.680
that's the part I'm…
I'm having trouble with.

36:04.120 --> 36:08.440
Someone smashed me over the head
with a crowbar to keep that photo hidden.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.640
Look, I'm not saying
it was the right call,

36:11.720 --> 36:15.520
but, uh, I just wanted
to stay out of all of this.

36:16.360 --> 36:19.000
But I had to get you the pictures.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.640
Sure there's nothing you've forgotten
to mention about Carlton or Guy?

36:28.880 --> 36:29.880
Nothing.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.760
So, um, do you go to these woods much?

36:39.720 --> 36:41.680
Not a lot. Occasionally. Why?

36:42.200 --> 36:44.600
Did you ever see
anyone else there apart from Carlton?

36:45.520 --> 36:46.560
Uh…

36:46.640 --> 36:50.360
Yeah, you run into people all the time.
Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.040
Oh.

36:54.440 --> 36:55.920
What about Stewart Green?

36:56.960 --> 36:58.520
Did he hang around these woods?

37:02.360 --> 37:03.200
No.

37:05.160 --> 37:06.240
I don't think so.

37:15.360 --> 37:16.680
-See you, Laura.
-Bye.

37:16.760 --> 37:20.560
You saw his face, right? When I asked him
if he'd seen Stewart Green in the woods.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.240
So what are you thinking?

37:23.760 --> 37:25.760
-He's lying.
-About?

37:26.920 --> 37:28.560
That's the part I'm not sure of.

37:30.560 --> 37:31.480
But he's lying.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.040
I've got somewhere to be.

38:05.480 --> 38:06.600
That bad?

38:10.000 --> 38:11.280
Get me one of those.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.560
The police think that I, um…

38:30.920 --> 38:32.640
They think that I killed Guy.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.920
And that I've got something
to do with this missing kid.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.200
And Stewart Green.

38:47.360 --> 38:48.680
What if they're right?

38:54.480 --> 38:55.840
When I'm blacked out,

38:57.520 --> 38:59.600
I don't even know…

38:59.680 --> 39:00.920
…who I am, and I…

39:02.200 --> 39:03.360
I can't…

39:04.800 --> 39:06.600
God.

39:09.280 --> 39:12.800
I would give anything
to know what happened that night.

39:17.440 --> 39:18.560
You turned up here.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.960
The morning after Cassie disappeared…

39:28.360 --> 39:29.480
you turned up here.

39:32.280 --> 39:33.720
You were covered in blood.

39:36.560 --> 39:39.680
You were catatonic,
just looking right through me.

39:40.440 --> 39:42.440
And when you finally went to sleep,

39:42.520 --> 39:44.760
you were just out for hours.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.960
When you woke up, you couldn't…
couldn't remember anything.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.760
And I… I've gotta tell you, Ray, you…
you have never been the same.

39:58.640 --> 40:00.200
I don't know what happened that night,

40:00.280 --> 40:02.840
but there was a Ray before
and a Ray after.

40:04.640 --> 40:05.680
I'm sorry.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.680
I like both, though.

40:12.400 --> 40:15.440
How could you not tell me, all this time?

40:18.880 --> 40:20.360
Christ, what have I done?

40:26.080 --> 40:27.080
You're not a killer.

40:29.880 --> 40:33.160
I don't know what happened that night,
but I know you. You…

40:33.800 --> 40:35.960
-You're not a killer.
-You sure about that?

40:38.800 --> 40:40.520
It's all connected. I can feel it.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.600
What happened in the woods,
this… this missing kid.

40:48.880 --> 40:49.880
Who killed Guy.

40:51.960 --> 40:53.160
Am I the connection?

41:00.600 --> 41:02.760
I tracked down
that number plate you wanted.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.160
Thanks, mate.

41:37.400 --> 41:38.360
-Hey.
-Hi, Niall.

41:38.440 --> 41:40.720
Um, we're still on
for dinner tonight, yeah?

41:40.800 --> 41:43.360
It's tomorrow, isn't it?
She's at book club tonight.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.440
-Ah! God!

41:45.520 --> 41:47.040
-What an idiot.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.520
Uh, okay, well, I'll, um…
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.160
Yeah, yeah, no worries. See ya.

41:52.680 --> 41:57.240
Oh, Niall, I, um… I left something
in the basement. Can I grab it?

41:57.320 --> 41:59.560
Yeah, of course. I'm just in here, so…

42:24.120 --> 42:26.960
<i> This is the voice mail</i>
<i>of DS Michael Broome. Leave a message.</i>

42:27.040 --> 42:28.560
-Hi, Detective Broome.

42:28.640 --> 42:30.360
It's, um,

42:31.480 --> 42:32.320
Cassie.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.960
I just wondered
if maybe you could swing by Harry's

42:36.040 --> 42:37.280
when you get a chance.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.600
Just check up on him.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.600
<i>I'm really worried about him.</i>
