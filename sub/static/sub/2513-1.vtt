Dad's pride and joy.

01:12.114 --> 01:14.057
He wanted you to have it.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.429
Goodbye!

02:01.176 --> 02:02.658
Look, Zoe,

02:02.683 --> 02:05.610
I'm still not convinced
that this is a good idea.

02:05.635 --> 02:07.695
What if your car breaks down?

02:07.720 --> 02:12.222
Have you seen the American southwest?
I mean, it's vast, desolate!

02:12.247 --> 02:13.891
I'll be okay.

02:13.916 --> 02:15.327
You'll be alone.

02:15.352 --> 02:18.223
And there's a lot of crazies out there.

02:18.326 --> 02:20.071
Me too.

02:22.972 --> 02:26.457
Just, promise me
you'll stay to the highways.

02:26.997 --> 02:28.163
God, not another picture.

02:28.188 --> 02:30.532
I've been crying all day,
I am a disaster.

Don't let them take me.

08:31.339 --> 08:32.663
You stay a while.

08:32.688 --> 08:35.080
Ain't no finders keepers around here, angel.

08:35.105 --> 08:37.215
Well, now, that's what she must be.

08:37.240 --> 08:42.434
'Cos only an angel would give a
flying fuck about a savage.

08:44.018 --> 08:45.975
What you got there?

08:46.205 --> 08:48.984
Whoa!
She's tough!

08:51.062 --> 08:53.870
Look at those fucking eyes.

08:58.311 --> 09:01.021
Now, that is a knife.

09:01.046 --> 09:03.771
Ha ha ha...!

09:27.976 --> 09:29.254
Fucking dead!

09:29.279 --> 09:31.455
No, no, no...

09:31.480 --> 09:34.246
Don't you shed a tear for him.

09:34.271 --> 09:35.407
Don't you dare.

09:35.432 --> 09:37.997
The only good gut eater
is a dead gut eater.

09:38.022 --> 09:40.767
Now that, that should be a commandment.

09:41.098 --> 09:42.615
Come on.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.722
Hand it over, angel.

09:44.747 --> 09:46.270
Come on.

09:47.760 --> 09:51.128
If you act like a lady,
I'll treat you like a lady.

09:53.386 --> 09:56.214
If you act like a bitch,
I'll...

09:57.269 --> 09:59.848
- That's right, angel, fly away!
- Fly!

09:59.873 --> 10:02.781
If she gets away, Trey,
that's all she rote.

10:13.199 --> 10:16.373
Look at the way she's moving.
Oh oh oh...

10:20.677 --> 10:23.723
One more, one more.
Right there.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.338
Come on now, Creed,
this is like tying up a piggie!

10:59.363 --> 11:00.907
Whoa!

11:06.092 --> 11:10.216
Huh, come on.
I fucking dare you!

11:11.586 --> 11:13.302
You like that, don't you?

11:13.327 --> 11:17.896
You like that nice shaft
sliding down that throat, don't you?

11:21.774 --> 11:23.548
Holy shit!

11:23.573 --> 11:25.173
You like?

11:25.800 --> 11:28.016
Come on now, West.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.136
All work, no play,

11:31.161 --> 11:33.353
gives man blue fucking balls.

11:33.378 --> 11:35.557
She don't belong here.

11:35.903 --> 11:39.694
She ain't someone worth a squirt.
No one gives a fuck about.

11:40.446 --> 11:44.340
- She's a deaf-mute.
- Reckon she's color blind too.

11:46.413 --> 11:48.023
Fuck this shit!

11:48.048 --> 11:51.127
If you don't like pussy, West,
then get the fuck out!

11:51.152 --> 11:53.717
There's a whole shit load of changes
since you been gone.

11:53.742 --> 11:56.771
You ain't the big man
on campus no more.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.286
Hey, Trey...

11:58.311 --> 12:00.018
You know what I think?

12:00.043 --> 12:04.815
I think Ol' West suppose been spending a little
too much time with them soldiers of fortune.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.031
Or maybe you just prefer
them two injuns?

12:07.056 --> 12:10.453
You like them tight
little brown butt holes?

12:12.444 --> 12:14.081
Enough with this fucking john.

12:14.106 --> 12:16.580
Let's have some fucking fun!

12:20.120 --> 12:21.800
Yeah!

12:49.154 --> 12:51.005
Welcome to
Acme

12:51.030 --> 12:51.925
Yeah.

12:51.950 --> 12:54.990
I need the phone number to the
Police Department in Acme, New Mexico.

12:55.015 --> 12:56.583
Acme?

12:57.068 --> 12:58.559
Acme.

13:09.837 --> 13:11.695
Now, now, now...

13:11.720 --> 13:14.791
This hurts me more
than it does you.

13:15.359 --> 13:18.495
You're gonna have to excuse
this accommodation.

13:18.520 --> 13:21.064
The bridal suite was taken.

13:23.229 --> 13:26.399
Easy baby...

13:33.210 --> 13:34.427
Look.

13:34.452 --> 13:38.171
You need to look, doll,
 and listen.

13:38.705 --> 13:40.994
I  ain't a monster, huh.

13:41.145 --> 13:43.877
You are in the presence
of a great man.

13:46.235 --> 13:50.410
Do you know
who my great great grandaddy was?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.212
Joseph West.

13:53.237 --> 13:54.657
That's right.

13:55.347 --> 14:01.134
Brigadier General Joseph Rodman West.

14:01.159 --> 14:05.794
That's his blood
flows through these veins...

14:05.819 --> 14:07.855
and my brothers.

14:07.880 --> 14:11.911
He's one of the greatest Americans
who ever lived.

14:17.560 --> 14:21.096
Kicked some major Apache ass.

14:29.880 --> 14:33.072
Seeing is believing.

14:36.023 --> 14:38.631
Ho.
Ta-da...

14:40.483 --> 14:43.816
Most of them are my grandaddy's work.

14:43.841 --> 14:48.282
Me, I'm just getting started
making my contribution.

14:49.441 --> 14:51.430
Hello, boys.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.596
This...

14:55.621 --> 15:00.246
This is the chief Mangas Coloradas, himself

15:00.271 --> 15:04.565
He tried to trick my grandaddy
into some kind of truce.

15:04.894 --> 15:08.396
Tried to play the general for a fool.

15:08.844 --> 15:15.170
But the last thing this white flag
waving buffalo humper saw coming,

15:15.195 --> 15:21.080
was his head being flayed,
flambeed and boiled.

15:21.105 --> 15:23.520
Look at him fucking split.

15:27.229 --> 15:28.878
Yeah.

15:28.903 --> 15:32.925
I'm not sure who the assholes
in the Smithsonian think they got.

15:32.950 --> 15:36.832
But this here,
this is the real deal.

15:39.257 --> 15:41.829
That war paint is a nice touch, huh?

15:41.854 --> 15:44.654
It gives you goosebumps, don't it?

15:55.135 --> 15:56.870
What've you got?

15:57.180 --> 15:58.752
Come on!

15:58.777 --> 16:01.422
That's it.
I'm out.

16:02.446 --> 16:04.249
Fuck you guys.

16:05.761 --> 16:07.745
Now, you win her ass.

16:07.770 --> 16:11.502
You know what.
You get her to bend down for your taking.

16:12.284 --> 16:14.774
Win-win for you, I guess.

16:19.380 --> 16:21.485
You wise up and watch
your tongue, Creed.

16:21.510 --> 16:23.407
We ain't bound by no blood.

16:23.432 --> 16:25.542
You're just some two bit wannabe.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.704
The next fagged joke
out of your mouth

16:27.729 --> 16:31.171
and you're going to be choking
on your own dick, you understand?

16:31.196 --> 16:33.740
Sure.
Whatever you say, West.

16:33.765 --> 16:35.269
Get up!

16:36.232 --> 16:38.385
And get the fuck out of here.

16:38.410 --> 16:40.012
Bye, Creed.

16:40.037 --> 16:41.869
See you boys around.

16:41.894 --> 16:45.090
I love you!
I do.

16:45.518 --> 16:46.798
Whoa.

16:47.737 --> 16:49.843
Big bad wolf.

16:57.199 --> 17:02.341
That pet of yours, Trey,
can't stay.

17:03.228 --> 17:05.442
She's got to be put down.

17:05.938 --> 17:08.056
Well, I don't know, West.

17:08.868 --> 17:12.803
It's kind of nice, she's having fun
feely lying around.

17:12.829 --> 17:15.134
You know, fuck.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.376
She's pretty.

17:17.401 --> 17:19.142
Docile.

17:19.859 --> 17:21.770
She ain't give no lip!

17:21.795 --> 17:24.821
What if she don't show
where she was heading?

17:26.220 --> 17:30.886
That news media's going to play
her sob story like a broken record.

17:34.412 --> 17:36.563
And there's going to be heat.

17:37.634 --> 17:39.345
A lot of it.

17:50.856 --> 17:52.271
Cody?

17:55.031 --> 17:58.265
I don't know, Trey.
But, West has a point.

17:58.290 --> 18:00.520
A handicap girl like that...

18:00.545 --> 18:02.992
This ain't no game, Trey.

18:07.340 --> 18:09.238
I'll make you a deal.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.442
Five Card Draw.

18:13.517 --> 18:16.642
I win, I get to keep her.

18:17.185 --> 18:20.409
Means she's off limit to
all you horny dicks.

18:22.315 --> 18:23.990
You win...

18:26.427 --> 18:29.085
and our angel gets her wings.

18:53.714 --> 18:55.387
One wish?

18:57.992 --> 18:59.820
Come live with me.

19:01.202 --> 19:02.870
Be with me.

19:04.490 --> 19:06.273
Yes, forever.

19:06.298 --> 19:09.509
Forever and ever and ever!

they can tell me where you are.

29:20.922 --> 29:23.077
Zoe, I've got to hang up.

Dead, Jed.

30:19.674 --> 30:22.115
I heard they found two fucked up
Injuns in Bluffs Creek.

30:22.140 --> 30:25.085
Would you believe I've been cleaning up
that mess all god damn night.

30:25.110 --> 30:26.592
I still got blood on my boots.

30:26.616 --> 30:30.112

got what they deserved.

30:30.137 --> 30:32.401

that deaf-mute girl went missing?

30:36.027 --> 30:38.079
Yeah.
I heard about that.

30:38.104 --> 30:39.711
Pretty girl.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.130
She's just your type too.

30:44.139 --> 30:47.054
Yeah, they found her car
just down the road.

30:47.284 --> 30:48.970
A shame.

30:52.122 --> 30:53.936
Now, I'm guessing...

30:54.419 --> 31:00.232
A sexy little girl like that
wonders in here, lost and alone.

31:00.257 --> 31:04.916
A man like you is not going to
hesitate to taking her home...

31:04.941 --> 31:09.296
hog tie her up and sodomizing
that sweet virgin ass.

31:09.321 --> 31:10.925
Now would you?

31:11.940 --> 31:13.235
Jed?

31:13.260 --> 31:16.286
Oh, take it easy, fucker.
I'm just fucking with you.

31:16.771 --> 31:18.021
Jed?

31:18.046 --> 31:21.485
What? Can you not see
I'm talking to this gentleman?

32:03.594 --> 32:05.029
44 Main Street.

32:05.054 --> 32:07.430
Okay.
Okay, thank you.

32:11.252 --> 32:13.794
Don't!
No, no, no!

32:13.978 --> 32:15.587
Noooo!

32:23.366 --> 32:24.767
Fuck!

32:33.017 --> 32:35.235

32:35.260 --> 32:36.922
Why you fucking cunt!

32:36.947 --> 32:39.270

Okay, I'll make you a deal.

32:44.795 --> 32:47.516

it's the local savages who did it, okay?

32:47.541 --> 32:49.195
And they're going to believe me,
do you know why?

32:49.220 --> 32:51.430
Because I'm the fucking law.

33:00.355 --> 33:01.979
Oh, my God.

33:08.410 --> 33:11.479
- Yo! Mister, you can't go in there!
- My girlfriend's in there! Zoe!

33:11.504 --> 33:15.343
There's no girl in there.
Now slow down and tell me your story.

33:15.632 --> 33:19.189
My fiancee, Zoe, has been missing
for 3 days now.

33:19.347 --> 33:21.263
I called you guys
and filed a report!

33:21.288 --> 33:22.391
What are you doing here?

33:22.416 --> 33:24.837
She called me about an hour ago
from a payphone on the street.

33:24.862 --> 33:26.207
- An hour ago?
- Yes!

33:26.232 --> 33:27.279
- From here?
- Yes!

33:27.304 --> 33:29.384
I... traced the call.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.795
I thought you said she was deaf.

33:31.820 --> 33:35.974
She's deaf but she can articulate
some words, like my name.

33:35.999 --> 33:38.334
She probably wasn't even sure
I was on the line.

33:38.359 --> 33:41.392
But she's in trouble,
real trouble, I can tell.

33:41.417 --> 33:43.818
Is your girlfriend capable of killing
a deputy sheriff

33:43.843 --> 33:47.098
and a 6 foot, 240 pound bartender?

33:47.123 --> 33:48.775
No, that's ridiculous.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.446
Zoe is light as a feather.
Besides, she wouldn't harm a fly.

33:52.471 --> 33:56.363
In that case, she's going to have to take
a back seat to the situation here.

34:00.874 --> 34:04.795
Look, stop by the station
first thing in the morning.

34:04.820 --> 34:06.686
I'll see what I can do.

34:36.100 --> 34:38.400
No, no, no, no, Trey.
No!

34:44.953 --> 34:46.034
Well?

34:46.060 --> 34:48.052
- It's him.
- Jesus Christ!

34:48.077 --> 34:51.513
Somebody butched him up real good.

34:53.194 --> 34:55.088
Get the fuck out of here!

34:56.014 --> 34:57.407
Excuse me.

34:59.136 --> 35:01.437
I was wondering if
you gentlemen can help me?

35:03.644 --> 35:05.007
Sorry.

35:05.032 --> 35:07.137
We don't help niggers.

35:07.486 --> 35:11.116
Well then.
How about helping a nice white girl?

35:11.141 --> 35:14.485
My fiancee passed through town
a couple of days ago.

35:16.505 --> 35:19.931
I ain't got time for this shit.
Get the fuck out of here.

35:19.956 --> 35:22.736
She called me from that payphone
less than an hour ago.

35:22.761 --> 35:24.384
What'd you say?

35:24.409 --> 35:26.374
She's probably still in the area.

35:26.399 --> 35:28.377
She called you?

35:29.534 --> 35:32.635
Yeah.
Any reason why she shouldn't have?

35:33.290 --> 35:34.488
Look, man.

35:34.513 --> 35:36.493
If you know what's good for you,
I'd walk away.

35:36.518 --> 35:39.943
My friend, their brother was just killed.
So, this really ain't a good time.

35:39.968 --> 35:42.438
Then, you know what it is
to lose someone.

35:42.463 --> 35:44.263
I've lost someone.

35:44.288 --> 35:47.822
And all I'm asking you to do,
is take a look at her picture.

35:55.368 --> 35:58.260
Sorry, never seen her.

35:59.015 --> 36:01.499
Pretty girl though.
I hope you find her.

36:01.748 --> 36:03.664
And if you'll just excuse us.

36:04.347 --> 36:07.235
Come on.
All you got to do is look.

36:07.260 --> 36:09.668
Aren't you curious to see
what a nigger lover looks like?

36:09.693 --> 36:11.850
Or maybe you already know?

36:12.001 --> 36:13.888
That's enough!
Put that away!

36:13.913 --> 36:16.433
Trey, call off your dog.

36:16.458 --> 36:19.355
Now look, I'm awful sorry about
what happened to your brother.

36:19.380 --> 36:22.008
Jed McGreedy was a good man
and a fine deputy.

36:22.033 --> 36:23.689
But right now
I need you to go home.

36:23.714 --> 36:24.784
All of you!

36:24.809 --> 36:27.073
You're gonna want to be spending time
with your families right now.

36:27.098 --> 36:31.041
Not locked up behind bars
for disorderly conduct!

36:31.519 --> 36:33.195
Now, go on!

36:34.523 --> 36:37.162
You.
In my office.

36:40.584 --> 36:43.361
The nigger's bluffing.
No way she'd called him.

36:43.385 --> 36:44.648
How do you know?

36:44.673 --> 36:47.531
Because when I kill someone,
they stays dead.

36:49.622 --> 36:51.157
Show me.

36:52.432 --> 36:54.458
I want to see the body.

36:56.306 --> 36:59.464
Those fucking guys know something about Zoe.
I'm certain of it.

36:59.656 --> 37:02.323
One of the murder victims
is Trey's brother.

37:02.348 --> 37:05.275
And he ain't gonna take it kindly
if you keep hounding him.

37:05.300 --> 37:08.407
And right now, I got some dead bodies
I got to deal with.

37:08.432 --> 37:11.886
And lucky for you,
your girlfriend isn't one of them.

37:18.437 --> 37:19.715
She's a pretty girl.

37:19.740 --> 37:22.639
She drive a 68 Blue GTO?

37:22.664 --> 37:23.873
Yeah.

37:24.565 --> 37:27.514
Somebody reported it on the side
of the highway this morning.

37:28.625 --> 37:31.253
How'd you figure she went missing
here in Acme?

37:32.150 --> 37:35.089
Zoe loves to take photos 
with her phone.

37:35.297 --> 37:39.100
She knew I was concerned, so she was
sending a photo upon the hour.

37:39.900 --> 37:42.415
The last photo she sent
was this one.

37:44.688 --> 37:46.951
Yes, that's route 40 alright.

37:46.977 --> 37:49.155
You mind?
Everything alright between you two?

37:49.180 --> 37:50.580
Yeah.

37:50.789 --> 37:53.178
We're getting ready to take a big leap.

37:53.537 --> 37:57.070
Move in together.
Get married.

37:57.715 --> 38:00.078
I want to buy her
the biggest diamond, but...

38:00.103 --> 38:04.419
She insisted on a simple band,
had it engraved.

38:04.802 --> 38:06.870
"Zoe and Dane forever."

38:08.060 --> 38:09.418
Look.

38:09.443 --> 38:11.875
I'll have my deputy
dust that payphone for prints.

38:11.900 --> 38:13.941
You can follow me down
to the station and...

38:13.966 --> 38:16.402
I'll have you fill out an official report.

40:50.300 --> 40:52.827
Well, it ain't very deep, West.

40:53.967 --> 40:58.785
Why don't you just bury her
in front of the police station.

40:59.509 --> 41:02.373
I stuck my blade in her to the hilt.

41:03.060 --> 41:05.540
Ain't no fucking way
she got up and walked away.

41:05.565 --> 41:07.045
What if she's alive?

41:07.070 --> 41:09.675
She went back into town
and fucking killed Jed.

41:09.700 --> 41:12.355
He was disemboweled and scalped.

41:12.380 --> 41:15.235
That ain't the work of a gut eater,
I don't know what is!

41:15.260 --> 41:17.952
Still,
where's the body?

41:19.118 --> 41:20.799
Coyotes.

41:21.839 --> 41:24.875
Wild dogs.
The desert.

41:27.931 --> 41:30.644
Is...
Is that a grave?

41:30.669 --> 41:32.173
Skeeter, get on back to the car!

41:32.198 --> 41:34.383
No, let him look!

41:34.704 --> 41:38.577
He needs to learn
this is a crazy fuck up world!

41:38.602 --> 41:42.109
Yeah,
and sometimes...

41:42.610 --> 41:45.394
even God's good creatures...

41:45.419 --> 41:47.635
They need to be sacrificed.

41:47.660 --> 41:49.549
Ain't that right, West?

41:50.953 --> 41:52.492
Alright.

41:53.420 --> 41:55.564
Given the events of the past week,

41:55.589 --> 41:59.180
I'll say there's any number of people
who wanted to see Jed dead.

42:00.811 --> 42:03.286
As far as our little Angeline now.

42:03.650 --> 42:05.725
The nigger said she called him.

42:05.750 --> 42:08.801
If that's true,
where the fuck she'd go?

42:10.412 --> 42:13.517
Let's say if she wasn't a corpse
when West buried her,

42:13.542 --> 42:16.283
I bet she sure is
hell is by now.

42:21.060 --> 42:25.724
Creed, we should lay low.
Get out of Dos till this shit blows over.

42:26.330 --> 42:29.418
Sure,Trey.
Sounds good.

42:50.421 --> 42:53.137
So, why scalped him?
It don't make no sense.

42:53.162 --> 42:54.888
Unless it was a squaw.

42:54.913 --> 42:59.284
Dog's been humping a few Reservation girls
on a regular bases.

42:59.820 --> 43:03.074
It was a man,
based on how Jed was butched,

43:03.099 --> 43:07.052
he's skilled, lethal.
Probably a hunter.

43:09.432 --> 43:12.571
Alright, that's everyone.

43:21.400 --> 43:23.442
What the fuck!

43:46.140 --> 43:48.825
God damn it, Trey,
pick up the fucking phone.

43:50.820 --> 43:53.364
Yeah, this better be fucking important.

43:53.729 --> 43:56.887
You guys, got to get over
to my place, man.

43:56.919 --> 43:58.842
I think she's here.
I think she's fucking...

43:58.867 --> 44:00.198
... here!

44:19.055 --> 44:20.619
God damn it!

44:20.803 --> 44:23.173
No, no!
Please!

44:23.891 --> 44:26.794
No, no!
Please, fucking please, no!

44:30.589 --> 44:31.895
No...

44:33.316 --> 44:35.411
No, wait!
No!

44:44.540 --> 44:46.110
Fuck you!

44:47.420 --> 44:48.974
Get the backpack.

44:50.180 --> 44:54.756
Yeah, I hate to do this...
Until this all blows over.

44:56.780 --> 44:58.808
Arrivederci, old friend.

45:06.565 --> 45:09.841
You guys, got to get over
to my place, man.

47:19.220 --> 47:22.525
You were pretty far gone
when I found you.

47:22.550 --> 47:28.040
I patched you up the best I could
then I attempted to bring you back.

47:28.065 --> 47:30.275
Only you weren't alone.

47:30.299 --> 47:33.574
You were in the company of Red Sleeves,

47:33.600 --> 47:36.289
the great Apache chieftain.

47:36.314 --> 47:41.355
Betrayed and murdered by white men
of a 100 years ago.

47:41.380 --> 47:45.670
He insisted he return with you.

47:45.695 --> 47:47.563
I said no.

47:47.588 --> 47:52.600
The old ways will not be
tolerated in today's world.

47:54.512 --> 47:57.093
Precious time was lost.

47:57.118 --> 48:01.636
By the time I reunited
your body with spirit,

48:01.661 --> 48:06.303
your heart gave out and you died.

48:07.260 --> 48:11.149
In any other case,
you would remain dead.

48:11.174 --> 48:13.171
But the Chief...

48:13.826 --> 48:15.975
... is cunning and quick.

48:16.000 --> 48:21.375
He entered your body at the same time
and you became one.

48:21.668 --> 48:23.864
But, know this.

48:23.889 --> 48:27.857
The flesh will not sustain for long.

48:27.882 --> 48:30.948
So, whatever you must do,

48:30.973 --> 48:34.259
do it before it's too late.

48:48.300 --> 48:52.124
He's dead alright.
Turned him into a human pincushion.

48:52.149 --> 48:53.743
I got to see it.
I got to see him!

48:53.768 --> 48:55.515
Get the fuck out of my way, Trey!

48:55.540 --> 48:58.755
Fuck that.
Don't fucking move!

48:58.780 --> 49:00.674
Any sign of the law?

49:00.699 --> 49:02.960
You let her live, didn't you?
Huh?

49:02.985 --> 49:05.365
Now, she's out for blood!

49:06.579 --> 49:08.835
Ain't no way some
deaf mute city girl's

49:08.860 --> 49:11.435
gonna get to jump on
Creed much less Jed.

49:11.460 --> 49:13.873
Creed said it was her.

49:13.898 --> 49:17.070
You heard him say it.
So explain that!

49:17.095 --> 49:18.826
I can't.

49:19.940 --> 49:21.969
I know what I know.

49:21.994 --> 49:25.355
If you ask me, I'd say
there's something wicked at work.

49:25.380 --> 49:27.131
Unnatural.

49:27.442 --> 49:29.169
I feel it.

49:29.194 --> 49:32.357
- I feel it in my bones.
- Ha!

49:32.695 --> 49:35.395
Unnatural or not.

49:35.420 --> 49:41.100
She found herself a hunting bow and now
we all got targets on our asses!

49:46.263 --> 49:47.712
Fuck!

49:49.574 --> 49:51.019
Alright.

49:51.044 --> 49:53.835
We got to turn the tables!

49:53.860 --> 49:55.392
Alright?

49:55.675 --> 49:59.216
We're going to get ourselves
some nigger bait,

49:59.397 --> 50:02.480
and we're gonna lure her to us
like a bitch in heat.

50:02.505 --> 50:04.359
We're gonna bring her to us.

50:04.980 --> 50:06.743
In that case,
you're gonna need some guns.

50:06.768 --> 50:09.968
Yeah, guns, some guns.
A lot of fucking guns!

50:09.993 --> 50:13.113
You know, the bartender, Coby,
who got killed with Jed,

50:13.138 --> 50:16.639
his father's a second lieutenant in the Marines.
He's a crazy motherfucker.

50:16.664 --> 50:20.201
- He's gonna want some pay back
- That man was in the Korean War.

50:20.226 --> 50:21.954
He's older than dirt.

50:21.979 --> 50:24.294
Yeah, but it makes no matter.

50:24.319 --> 50:27.829
That guy's got a cashier of weapons
big enough to defend Fort Knox.

50:27.854 --> 50:29.013
Aye?

50:29.038 --> 50:30.188
Let's move.

50:30.213 --> 50:33.967
Skeeter, you're gonna
have to sit this one out.

50:37.340 --> 50:40.268
Belle!
Stop digging in that earth.

50:40.293 --> 50:42.064
Get in here this instance.

50:42.089 --> 50:44.803
What you got there?
Some dead animal?

50:46.860 --> 50:48.379
Oh my God!

50:48.404 --> 50:51.915
Are you sure you dog didn't go
strolling off the premises?

50:51.940 --> 50:54.032
We got 4 hectares,
it's all fenced in.

50:54.057 --> 50:55.715
Where's he gonna go?

50:55.740 --> 50:58.677
And you haven't seen any
strangers wondering around at night?

50:58.702 --> 51:03.315
No, but some son of a bitch
has been stealing from my barn.

51:03.340 --> 51:05.084
My new hunting bow
I got from Christmas,

51:05.109 --> 51:07.011
arrows and everything.

51:07.577 --> 51:09.274
Hunting bow, huh?

51:09.635 --> 51:11.293
Mind I take a look?

51:13.366 --> 51:15.604
Good god, oh mighty!

51:15.629 --> 51:18.223
What'd you got in here,
a dead coyote?

51:19.286 --> 51:22.352
My oh my!
Something dead has been living in here.

51:22.377 --> 51:25.812
Lizzy, that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

51:25.837 --> 51:28.793
It can't be alive if it's dead.

51:30.097 --> 51:32.186
Dispatch to Sheriff Holt, come in.

51:32.211 --> 51:33.835
Go ahead, Jesse.

51:33.860 --> 51:36.083
Officer Stanfield just called in.

51:36.115 --> 51:38.755
He says he found Creed Traver's dead.

51:38.780 --> 51:42.757
He says it looks like somebody
used him for target practice.

51:43.540 --> 51:45.235
What do you mean?

51:45.260 --> 51:48.353
He was all shot up with arrows.

51:48.378 --> 51:50.669
Jesus Christ!

51:50.962 --> 51:53.988
Tell Stanfield to wait there.
I'm on my way.

51:54.620 --> 51:55.754
One more thing.

51:55.779 --> 51:57.558
The result from the lab came in,

51:57.583 --> 52:01.104
and you were right.
Jed's killer used the payphone.

52:02.855 --> 52:04.517
His killer?

52:04.542 --> 52:09.909
The prints from the bottle used to killed Jed,
matched the one on the payphone.

52:15.325 --> 52:20.496
MISSING PERSON
REWARD! PLEASE HELP!
NAME: ZOE CARDEN

53:32.795 --> 53:35.516
Please forget me

53:37.194 --> 53:38.747
Zoe!

53:43.398 --> 53:45.595
Oh.
Are you okay?

53:45.620 --> 53:47.568
This is for Creed!

53:48.059 --> 53:52.075
Angel, we got your boyyy!

53:52.100 --> 53:56.756
Angel, we got your boyyy!

53:57.242 --> 54:00.007
We're gonna open a can of them worms
on this nigger!

54:03.106 --> 54:06.073
That should get her fucking attention,
huh, Trey?

54:08.031 --> 54:09.471
Fuck!

54:12.300 --> 54:15.194
- Shit...
- Oh mother of God!

54:16.940 --> 54:18.771
Let's go!

54:21.200 --> 54:22.757
Catch me!

54:28.915 --> 54:31.525
Damn fucking bitch.

54:34.178 --> 54:36.350
What the fuck is in my neck?

54:42.961 --> 54:44.943
God damn it!

54:49.097 --> 54:50.822
The hospital's that way.

54:50.847 --> 54:52.653
Fucking other way.

55:24.442 --> 55:26.908
She's in the fucking truck, man.

55:28.874 --> 55:31.803
Why don't you die, fucking bitch!

55:41.159 --> 55:42.350
Oh.

56:09.309 --> 56:11.363
Suck on this!

56:12.251 --> 56:14.525
Whoa!
Yeah!

56:16.733 --> 56:19.946
- Fucking aye, Trey.
- Oh, how'd you like that?

56:36.576 --> 56:38.161
What the fuck!

56:41.500 --> 56:45.409
That did not fucking happen.
What the fuck?

57:10.441 --> 57:13.090
I must have stabbed that bitch
over 2 dozen times.

57:13.115 --> 57:15.663
I could not shake her resolve.

57:17.180 --> 57:19.643
- And that look in her eyes.
- Trey.

57:19.668 --> 57:21.854
I've seen it before.

57:22.719 --> 57:24.491
Soulless.

57:24.710 --> 57:27.854
- West.
- Like a Grim Reaper.

57:28.682 --> 57:30.255
Savage.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.169
You guys. You got to get
me to the hospital.

57:32.194 --> 57:34.955
I can't stay here.
I'm gonna die if I stay here.

57:34.980 --> 57:41.027
It's as if her dead carcass is
being controlled like a puppet.

57:42.500 --> 57:46.034
Then maybe we need
to be asking ourselves.

57:46.105 --> 57:47.795
Who's pulling the strings?

57:47.820 --> 57:49.751
Well, you know.
The only man I know in town

57:49.776 --> 57:52.074
that can do something like that
is the old witch doctor.

57:52.099 --> 57:54.371
- Witch doctor.
- I need a doctor!

57:54.396 --> 57:56.708
Shut the fuck up, Cody!

57:57.922 --> 57:59.463
When we get out of here,

57:59.488 --> 58:02.517
I say we pay that old Indian a visit.

58:05.180 --> 58:07.941
The cavalry's here.
Move out.

58:11.675 --> 58:16.087
Welcome to the war, man.
I see you came dressed for the occasion.

58:16.420 --> 58:17.900
Goat.

58:18.416 --> 58:21.608
Roddy, I'm sorry about to your boy.

58:21.633 --> 58:25.287
Clay served the best tequila on this side
of the Mexican border, we all loved him.

58:25.312 --> 58:30.634
The bitch sliced his throat from ear to ear,
butched him like cattle.

58:30.659 --> 58:36.651
I want to know who and why
the fuck she did this to my boy.

58:37.786 --> 58:39.374
Why?

58:39.820 --> 58:42.170
Wrong place, wrong time.

58:42.195 --> 58:43.835
Uh, who?
Well...

58:43.860 --> 58:47.680
That's a tale for campfires
that will make you toe nails grow up.

58:47.705 --> 58:49.105
Show me the party favors!

58:49.140 --> 58:54.037
Men, let me introduce to you,
the M4 carbine assault rifle.

58:54.062 --> 58:56.035
Endorsed by the same Grim Reaper himself.

58:56.060 --> 59:01.006
This little baby has sent more terrorist to hell
than any other weapon on the planet.

59:04.779 --> 59:06.988
That's what I'm talking about.

01:02:28.085 --> 01:02:33.675
You yahoos want to tell me why 
that bitch went on a murderous rampage.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.086
Why my boy is on a slab 
in the morgue?

01:02:43.562 --> 01:02:46.885
It must have been a damnable sin.

01:02:49.541 --> 01:02:54.993
Let's just say she was a...
real life angel.

01:02:55.018 --> 01:02:58.585
Deaf-mute.
But, her eyes...

01:02:58.995 --> 01:03:00.995
... they spoke volumes.

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.635
Heavenly eyes.

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.749
Virgin to the evils men do.

01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.525
Till that fateful day.

01:03:17.759 --> 01:03:22.435
Jed went first, pumping into her 
like a wild stallion.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:26.014
I swear that he was going to 
have a heart attack.

01:03:27.074 --> 01:03:30.443
The fighting and the kicking 
and the barbed wire,

01:03:30.468 --> 01:03:32.549
didn't stop her.
None.

01:03:33.627 --> 01:03:37.276
Oh, after Jed 
come Creed and Cody went up.

01:03:37.938 --> 01:03:39.648
Cody...

01:03:40.598 --> 01:03:44.061
They must have broke her 
because just when I had at her.

01:03:45.336 --> 01:03:48.857
She just lay there quiet like
while I did my thing.

01:03:49.295 --> 01:03:52.010
Hell, I think she even enjoyed it.

01:03:53.758 --> 01:03:56.778
But all good things 
must come to an end.

01:03:57.422 --> 01:04:01.634
And that's when West pulled out 
that bowie knife of his.

01:04:02.014 --> 01:04:04.960
Gut into that nigger lover to the hilt.

01:04:11.105 --> 01:04:13.021
Says he buried her too.

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.660
Ain't that right, West?

01:04:18.849 --> 01:04:23.364
I reckoned she didn't like her resting place,
'cos the next thing we know...

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.368
She's back from the dead.

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:30.363
And hell-bent on killing us all.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.388
Guess that's what happens 
when you drag an angel into hell.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.877
It becomes a demon.

01:04:40.902 --> 01:04:42.430
That's it, I'm getting 
the fuck out of here.

01:04:42.455 --> 01:04:44.675
Sit your ass down, Cody

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.543
You walk out that door, that air 
is the least of your concerns.

01:04:47.568 --> 01:04:50.155
I'm bleeding out like a 
slaughtered pig here, Trey.

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.875
I can't let you go, brother.

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:54.168
That arrow hit an artery
you'd be dead by now.

01:04:54.193 --> 01:04:56.202
From what I can tell,
the bleeding's slowed.

01:04:56.227 --> 01:04:58.388
So, come sun up, 
we'll fetch Dr. Myers.

01:04:58.413 --> 01:05:02.363
Dr. Myers.
The veterinarian?

01:05:03.798 --> 01:05:05.023
Come on.

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:07.245
Fuck!

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.711
- Skeeter?
- Sheriff.

01:05:21.396 --> 01:05:23.304
Come on out here, boy.

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.246
Your brothers around?

01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.310
You want to tell me 
about the girl?

01:05:32.017 --> 01:05:34.101
Was Jed involved?

01:05:34.220 --> 01:05:35.551
Was Jed involved?

01:05:35.606 --> 01:05:37.726
He hurt her bad.

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.750
They all did.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.711
Is she alive?

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.790
Dammit, boy, answer me!
Is she alive or is she dead?

01:05:46.815 --> 01:05:48.593
She ain't dead!

01:05:49.532 --> 01:05:52.514
West killed her 
but she didn't stay dead.

01:05:52.540 --> 01:05:58.118
She murdered Jed and Creed,
and now, she's coming for us all.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.290
Where are they?

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.758
You know what I think?

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:13.382
I think you boys gave that girl
a greater appreciation for the white meat.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.997
Maybe she don't give a fuck
for this nigger anymore.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:23.423
What are you looking at?

01:06:24.557 --> 01:06:26.533
You want a piece of me?

01:06:26.812 --> 01:06:27.965
Huh?

01:06:36.653 --> 01:06:38.035
Motherfucker!

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:39.875
What the fuck you're doing?

01:06:39.900 --> 01:06:43.155
Nigger and his bitch are going to pay 
for what they did to my boy.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:45.039
The man had nothing to do with it.

01:06:45.064 --> 01:06:46.195
Bullshit!

01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:49.195
Blackies rolling into Acme
for one or two reasons:

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.557
To start trouble. 
Or to spread the good Lord's gospel.

01:06:54.254 --> 01:06:57.994
Well, I don't see a crucifix on his neck.

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.141
I say we shoot him in the knees.

01:07:01.166 --> 01:07:03.742
Then, when she hears him scream.

01:07:03.767 --> 01:07:08.195
Maybe, she'll understand 
the urgency of the situation.

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.443
You might end up on her shit list.

01:07:10.468 --> 01:07:12.734
Fuck her!
Bring it on!

01:07:12.759 --> 01:07:14.656
Cody's getting away.

01:07:17.266 --> 01:07:18.766
Cody!

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:22.819
He's taking my car!

01:07:22.844 --> 01:07:24.493
Crap!

01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:37.836
He makes it to the hospital,
that's all shit roll.

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:43.419
Sorry, brother.

01:07:57.826 --> 01:07:59.114
Oh.
Hell, no!

01:07:59.139 --> 01:08:01.962
I'm not dying today.
I'm not dying today!

01:08:36.899 --> 01:08:40.332
Well, that ain't the puppet master himself.

01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:49.689
Goat, you stay here.

01:08:49.714 --> 01:08:51.714
Make sure she doesn't
come up this way.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:54.145
Will, Roddy, take cover 
in that house behind us.

01:08:54.171 --> 01:08:56.154
You force that bitch
straight to us.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.500
Come on!

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:13.069
What the fuck is going on?

01:09:13.094 --> 01:09:15.674
What kind of sick mind game 
are you all playing?

01:09:15.698 --> 01:09:17.035
No game.

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.680
Valentine day's come early this year.

01:09:19.706 --> 01:09:22.354
Your sweetheart's come home.

01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.995
She's alive?

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:27.634
Yeah, for lack of a better word.

01:09:27.979 --> 01:09:31.421
Don't fuck with me!
Is she alive or is she dead?

01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:49.429
Zoe... is alive.

01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:57.347
She's alive!

01:10:01.021 --> 01:10:03.043
And she's gonna...

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:05.639
She's gonna get you!

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:10.395
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

01:10:13.464 --> 01:10:18.255
She's gonna kill all you motherfuckers!
Ha ha ha ha...

01:10:30.329 --> 01:10:34.015
You motherfuckers!
Is this some kind of a joke?

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:41.758
West, go check that out.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:51.039
BABY, GIVE THEM HELL !!!

01:10:53.114 --> 01:10:55.150
YEAHHH !

01:10:57.780 --> 01:10:59.764
You thought Zoe was
deaf and dumb, huh?

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:01.830
Shut your fucking mouth!

01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:10.327
My baby has an axe to grind!

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.786
- She'll chew your ass up!
- Motherfucker!

01:11:19.178 --> 01:11:20.968
I think I got her.

01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:59.560
Fucking dumb asses.

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:03.182
Get off me, fucker...!

01:12:07.011 --> 01:12:08.329
Fuck.

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:11.496
God damn it.

01:12:11.521 --> 01:12:13.389
What the fuck!

01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:22.201
What the fuck.

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.618
Who are you?

01:12:27.979 --> 01:12:29.946
What do you want?

01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:17.305
One little, 
two little...

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.916
Three little Indians...

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:29.599
Four little, five little,
Six little Indians.

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:35.406
Seven little, eight little,
Nine little Indians,

01:13:35.431 --> 01:13:38.680
Ten little Indian boys.

01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:03.122
West?

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.681
West?

01:14:42.426 --> 01:14:47.375
WALK IN HELL!

01:14:56.427 --> 01:14:57.929
Trey McGreedy!

01:14:57.954 --> 01:14:59.841
This is Sheriff Holt!

01:14:59.866 --> 01:15:01.755
I need you boys 
to come out of there!

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.119
Make sure I can see your hands!

01:15:05.444 --> 01:15:06.955
Sheriff!

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.635
Sheriff, get me out of here!

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.035
Parsons, are you in there?

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:12.969
Sheriff!
You ain't real.

01:15:16.030 --> 01:15:17.798
You ain't real.

01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:21.189
Sheriff!
Oh my God!

01:15:21.214 --> 01:15:22.515
Am I glad to see you!

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.484
- Trey.
- Yeah.

01:15:23.509 --> 01:15:24.934
- Stay right there.
- You have... You have no idea.

01:15:24.959 --> 01:15:26.478
God damn it, Trey,
don't make me shoot you!

01:15:26.503 --> 01:15:28.191
This is so...

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:37.524
Sheriff?

01:15:40.051 --> 01:15:41.671
Sheriff...

01:15:43.025 --> 01:15:44.952
She's alive.

01:15:46.580 --> 01:15:48.614
My baby's alive.

01:16:22.140 --> 01:16:23.540
Zoe?

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:30.197
Oh my God.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.799
Look what they've done to you.

01:16:35.061 --> 01:16:36.301
No!

01:16:36.806 --> 01:16:38.617
Wait. 
No.

01:16:38.642 --> 01:16:40.071
Zoe.

01:16:40.177 --> 01:16:43.271
Zoe, baby, we need to 
get you to a hospital.

01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:45.270
Zoe?

01:16:45.922 --> 01:16:47.500
Zoe!

01:16:52.002 --> 01:16:53.990
Help me.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.035
Mr. Parsons.

01:17:19.060 --> 01:17:22.879
I must tell you something 
about you fiancee.

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.250
The truth will be hard 
for you to hear.

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.555
And harder to comprehend.

01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:32.677
You must call me
when you get this.

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:43.634
Don't you fucking move.

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.925
"Walk in hell".
Huh?

01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:48.795
Mean anything to you?

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.414
Words my great grandaddy 
whispered to an Apache Chief

01:17:51.439 --> 01:17:54.635
before beheading him
over a 100 fucking years ago.

01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:57.231
Nobody knows that 
except for me and my kin.

01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:58.723
So, what the hell is going on?

01:17:58.748 --> 01:18:01.609
I was only trying to save a life 
which you took.

01:18:01.634 --> 01:18:03.955
- But I was too late.
- The hell you were too late!

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:06.537
She's running around killing 
like a blood thirsty savage.

01:18:06.563 --> 01:18:09.108
It was their mutual hunger 
for the blood of your ancestors

01:18:09.133 --> 01:18:10.717
that brought them together.

01:18:10.742 --> 01:18:13.475
- They found each other.
- You say his name, god damn it.

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:15.657
I'm warning you. 
You say his name.

01:18:15.682 --> 01:18:20.320
Red Sleeves.
The great Apache Chief "Mangas Coloradas".

01:18:20.345 --> 01:18:22.188
He's been watching from the shadows

01:18:22.213 --> 01:18:26.511
while your family perpetuates
the extermination of his people.

01:18:27.443 --> 01:18:28.595
You do something!

01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:30.517
Or I swear 
I'll kill you right here.

01:18:30.542 --> 01:18:33.226
For the young woman sake,
I would stop this if I could.

01:18:33.251 --> 01:18:35.305
But there's nothing I can do.

01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:38.182
Her bloodshed will not cease 
until you...

01:18:38.207 --> 01:18:39.760
- The last is dead.
- Bullshit!

01:18:39.785 --> 01:18:43.435
You brought him here, 
you can send him the fuck away!

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.503
There is only one way.

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.795
Lay the great Chief to rest.

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:51.875
Here, on sacred ground.

01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:53.475
But, when you consider,

01:18:53.499 --> 01:18:58.088
he's been lost in this vast desert plains
for over a 100 years.

01:18:58.114 --> 01:19:03.301
Lady Luck better be smiling upon you.

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:14.745
You old fool.

01:19:14.820 --> 01:19:17.049
You have no idea.

01:19:17.074 --> 01:19:19.562
Get in the god damn trailer!

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:22.151
I'm telling you, 
it was my fiancee.

01:19:22.176 --> 01:19:23.995
You guys need to be 
out there searching.

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:28.003
When the officers on the scene found you,
they said that you were facing the wall.

01:19:28.028 --> 01:19:29.393
How could you have seen her?

01:19:29.418 --> 01:19:31.765
The reflection in the glass.

01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:33.721
She was hurt.

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:38.375
God knows what they did to her.

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:42.272
She didn't even looked like herself.

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:10.455
I warned Trey, that boy 
was not like the rest of us.

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:14.114
He didn't have no criminal mind.

01:20:14.529 --> 01:20:17.858
And now look at him!

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:22.926
The light of my life is gone.

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:29.252
It wouldn't matter if is.

01:20:31.184 --> 01:20:34.200
You'd have come to kill him anyway.

01:20:34.225 --> 01:20:36.771
Wouldn't you, Mangas

01:20:43.500 --> 01:20:48.955
My grandpa, Joseph, did the best 
he could to exterminate you all.

01:20:48.980 --> 01:20:53.512
And when he died, 
the deed fell to my daddy.

01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:56.545
And then on to me.

01:20:57.386 --> 01:21:00.340
Me and my boys.

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:06.012
Big shoes to fill.

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:21.277
And as far as the 
young lady's concerned.

01:21:22.564 --> 01:21:24.605
Sorry, honey.

01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:28.500
You're just a casualty of war.

01:21:40.825 --> 01:21:42.234
Fuck!

01:21:56.909 --> 01:21:58.261
Okay.

01:22:07.398 --> 01:22:09.204
What the hell?

01:22:09.733 --> 01:22:11.047
Shit!

01:22:12.090 --> 01:22:14.480
Damn it!
Mangas?

01:22:14.739 --> 01:22:16.567
Come on, man!

01:22:16.866 --> 01:22:20.127
Mangas!
Fucking Mangas!

01:22:27.771 --> 01:22:29.790
Well, well...

01:22:34.576 --> 01:22:39.227
I thought I smelled some of that
eau de toilette your wear.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.330
See what I've done.

01:22:42.355 --> 01:22:46.758
It's a little something,
for the two of you to get cosy.

01:22:47.619 --> 01:22:52.764
Don't it just make you wanna
lay that pretty head of yours down?

01:22:52.789 --> 01:22:54.376
Per Se.

01:22:56.770 --> 01:22:58.540
An eternity?

01:23:45.433 --> 01:23:46.900
Like that?

01:23:47.419 --> 01:23:50.325
Oh, yeah.
Come on!

01:24:22.979 --> 01:24:26.139
Oh!
You fucking bitch!

01:24:27.450 --> 01:24:29.046
You fucking...

01:24:43.559 --> 01:24:44.807
Fuck!

01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:50.272
You walk in hell.

01:25:19.657 --> 01:25:21.296
What happened here?

01:25:22.119 --> 01:25:23.980
What happened?

01:27:45.233 --> 01:27:50.537
(sign) I love you.

01:27:53.260 --> 01:27:55.342
I love you too.

01:28:36.274 --> 01:28:38.374
Did I do the right thing?

01:28:39.499 --> 01:28:41.828
It was all you could do.

01:28:41.853 --> 01:28:45.335
Now, 
she's gone from this cruel world.

01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.830
But exist in a better place.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.829
A beautiful world that awaits us all.

01:28:54.480 --> 01:28:56.536
Do you really believe that?

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.454
I have seen the gates.

01:28:59.479 --> 01:29:03.449
Though, I've not been permitted to enter.

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:06.564
At least not yet.
