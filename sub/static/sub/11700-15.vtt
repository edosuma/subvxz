WEBVTT

00:00.830 --> 00:02.053
This is fun, right?

00:02.153 --> 00:05.122
Us hanging out like two old
friends who've never dated

00:05.156 --> 00:07.357
or broke up or had anything weird happen.

00:07.391 --> 00:10.025
Oh, my God, so much fun.

00:11.829 --> 00:13.564
This really is not fun, is it?

00:13.598 --> 00:15.532
No. No.

00:15.567 --> 00:17.734
I mean, I want it to be.

00:17.769 --> 00:20.136
I'm just wondering if there's
too much stuff between us now.

00:20.171 --> 00:22.405
Okay, yeah, so there's some stuff.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.840
But, I mean, we can get past that, right?

00:24.875 --> 00:27.310
We've been friends our whole lives.

00:27.344 --> 00:28.678
Like, what would you be doing

00:28.712 --> 00:30.549
if you were here with Tucker instead?

00:30.631 --> 00:32.098
Probably building the perfect woman

00:32.133 --> 00:34.500
using celebrity body parts.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.870
Or playing this hook-up game called
"shot and score".

00:36.904 --> 00:38.971
Shot and score?

00:39.005 --> 00:41.674
Yeah, you take a shot, pick a stranger

00:41.708 --> 00:43.075
and try and get them to make out with you.

00:43.109 --> 00:45.444
The first one back to the stool wins.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.680
Like, with a stranger stranger?

00:47.714 --> 00:50.034
It's okay, I'm not suggesting we play.

00:50.316 --> 00:52.592
Why not? I wanna play.
That's what friends do.

00:52.692 --> 00:55.259
Hey. Two vodka shots, please,

00:55.294 --> 00:58.219
'cause my buddy and I here are playing
"shot and score."

00:58.319 --> 00:59.386
Pow!

00:59.420 --> 01:01.255
All right, if you wanna play...

01:01.289 --> 01:03.931
Oh, I dare you to shot and score with him.

01:04.031 --> 01:07.867
Very nice. Handsome, a little older.

01:07.967 --> 01:11.136
Like, "interesting" older, not "eww" older.

01:11.170 --> 01:14.506
And, uh, I pick...

01:14.540 --> 01:16.574
Her for you.

01:16.609 --> 01:18.110
She seems like your type.

01:18.144 --> 01:19.945
Female.

01:19.979 --> 01:20.814
Perfect.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.447
Oh, and if you happen to
overhear me mentioning

01:22.481 --> 01:23.949
something about being an airline pilot,

01:23.983 --> 01:26.251
that's just because she didn't
believe I was a doctor, okay?

01:26.285 --> 01:27.919
So, you ready? On three.

01:27.953 --> 01:30.689
One, two, three.

01:32.291 --> 01:33.029
- Ah.
- Uhh.

01:33.129 --> 01:34.963
Wait.

01:34.997 --> 01:36.430
I think I need to play
"two shots and score."

01:36.465 --> 01:37.465
I'm really not ready.

01:40.836 --> 01:43.704

01:50.880 --> 01:52.947
Hey, I'm really sorry to rush
you out of here like this,

01:52.982 --> 01:54.282
but the airline called,

01:54.316 --> 01:57.118
and I accidentally brought
home the keys to the plane.

01:57.152 --> 01:58.218
Ben.

01:58.253 --> 01:59.620
Riley! Hi!

01:59.654 --> 02:01.989
Hey, you're up early. Uh, this is...

02:02.023 --> 02:03.791
Jessica.

02:03.825 --> 02:07.561
Yeah, it's okay, I don't know your name,
either... Captain.

02:11.065 --> 02:14.134
So, how did shot and score go last night?

02:14.168 --> 02:15.869
Oh, you mean the part where

02:15.904 --> 02:17.905
I go up to a random guy and hit on him,

02:17.939 --> 02:19.773
and then he looks at me
like I have six heads,

02:19.807 --> 02:21.741
so I go back to the stool to wait for you,

02:21.776 --> 02:23.877
but you're already gone because
you took a stranger home

02:23.912 --> 02:26.179
for "shot and score: The home edition"?

02:27.581 --> 02:30.450
Sorry. My shot and score kinda turned into

02:30.484 --> 02:32.685
shot, score, and a little more.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.287
My God, Ben.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.756
I can't believe you care more
about scoring with a stranger

02:36.791 --> 02:38.224
than hanging out with a friend.

02:38.258 --> 02:42.629
Yeah, we should probably just
go to the movies next time.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.235
Come on, come on, come on.

02:49.269 --> 02:50.836
You know, I really had...

02:50.870 --> 02:52.171
oh, yeah. Tell it to your mother.

02:52.205 --> 02:54.073
Go, go, go, go, go!

02:55.662 --> 02:56.962
Touchdown!

03:00.067 --> 03:01.567
Isn't that amazing?

03:01.601 --> 03:04.703
Yeah, she also does it for "score,"
"field goal,"

03:04.737 --> 03:06.772
and luckily "time to put a sweater on."

03:06.806 --> 03:08.473
Pay up.

03:08.507 --> 03:10.876
Seriously? You consider that a trick?

03:10.910 --> 03:12.551
I taught her how to peel
a banana with her feet.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.619
Look, all right, tell you what,

03:14.653 --> 03:16.287
I am a fair man

03:16.321 --> 03:18.889
with a slight gambling problem.

03:18.923 --> 03:20.858
So, uh, how about double or nothing?

03:20.892 --> 03:22.993
I'm not stupid, Tucker.

03:23.028 --> 03:25.863
You know if I win,
I'm gonna pick double, not nothing.

03:25.897 --> 03:27.230
Oh, my God, I'm so late.

03:27.265 --> 03:28.077
I didn't get any sleep last night.

03:28.177 --> 03:30.078
Yeah, I ran into your reason why

03:30.112 --> 03:32.080
when I got up to use the bathroom.

03:32.114 --> 03:34.750
Yeah. We chatted. She was naked.

03:34.784 --> 03:36.418
It was awkward.

03:36.452 --> 03:38.420
Oh, you did? Was she nice?

03:38.454 --> 03:39.921
We didn't really get a chance to talk.

03:40.957 --> 03:42.723
Why is Emma dressed like that?

03:42.758 --> 03:44.192
You guys aren't teaching her weird stuff

03:44.226 --> 03:45.693
and betting on her again, are you?

03:45.727 --> 03:48.396
- Who, us?
- No way. Never.

03:48.431 --> 03:49.897
- Don't be insulting.
- That would be wrong.

03:49.932 --> 03:51.366
Okay, good.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.233
All right, Emma, wish daddy luck.

03:53.268 --> 03:55.269
Since Henderson got sent
away for tax evasion,

03:55.303 --> 03:56.704
the bar's up for sale, and a couple

03:56.738 --> 03:58.473
of potential buyers are
coming by this morning.

03:58.507 --> 04:00.608
- Well, that's good, right?
- Uh, no.

04:00.642 --> 04:02.443
What if the new owners
are expecting enthusiasm,

04:02.478 --> 04:04.078
high standards and motivation?

04:04.112 --> 04:05.580
I could be out of a job.

04:10.586 --> 04:11.786
Mrs. Wheeler?

04:11.820 --> 04:13.388
What are you doing in my office?

04:13.422 --> 04:16.524
Wondering what you're
doing in your office on a Tuesday

04:16.559 --> 04:18.793
when you're supposed to
be at a staff meeting!

04:18.827 --> 04:20.394
It's Wednesday.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.728
Wow.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.731
Margarita Monday really
got away from me there.

04:23.765 --> 04:28.270
Wait. Are you using my printer
to make real estate flyers?

04:28.270 --> 04:30.505
Riley, do you know how much
it costs to make copies?

04:30.539 --> 04:31.573
No.

04:31.607 --> 04:32.907
Well, I do.

04:32.941 --> 04:35.510
Well, at least I did until
you started working here.

04:35.544 --> 04:37.812
Whatever. It's fine.

04:37.846 --> 04:40.514
I actually really need to talk
to someone about something

04:40.548 --> 04:42.750
that you're kind of an expert in.

04:42.784 --> 04:44.985
- Real estate?
- No.

04:45.020 --> 04:47.054
One-night stands.

04:47.089 --> 04:49.190
I had my first one last night.

04:49.224 --> 04:53.894
Ha ha ha ha!

04:53.929 --> 04:56.330
Oh, man!

04:56.364 --> 04:58.898
I remember my first one-night stand.

04:58.933 --> 05:01.968
No, I don't.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.174
It was... it was supposed to be

05:03.274 --> 05:05.442
this drunken, stupid thing, you know?

05:05.476 --> 05:08.846
Then he just texted me. What do I do?

05:08.880 --> 05:10.258
Are you sure it wasn't one of my guys?

05:10.358 --> 05:11.958
'Cause I always give them your number.

05:13.928 --> 05:15.028
My God! Oh, my God!

05:15.062 --> 05:17.097
There he is! Hide! Hide!

05:17.131 --> 05:18.565
What is he doing here?

05:18.600 --> 05:21.535
Oh, he's probably one of
those crazy stalker guys.

05:21.569 --> 05:23.303
Oh! This could not be worse!

05:23.338 --> 05:26.773
I don't know. He could be a client.

05:26.807 --> 05:28.307
That might be a little worse.

05:32.747 --> 05:35.018
Oh! Thank you, Emma!

05:35.118 --> 05:38.853
See? I told you I could top
that lame touchdown trick.

05:38.887 --> 05:41.856
Wow! You taught her how to bus a table.

05:41.890 --> 05:44.458
Congratulations.
She has a bright future ahead of her.

05:45.728 --> 05:48.129
Hey, guys, you see that dude right there?

05:48.163 --> 05:50.832
That's Ian Hughes, the new
restaurateur everyone's talking about.

05:50.866 --> 05:52.767
Everything he touches turns to gold,

05:52.801 --> 05:55.069
and he's thinking about buying this place.

05:55.104 --> 05:57.571
Dude, why is Emma here?
Isn't she supposed to be at day care?

05:57.606 --> 05:59.737
Yeah. She just wanted to see her dad.
Sheesh.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.338
Now she feels rejected.

06:01.372 --> 06:03.407
Way to go, dad.

06:04.508 --> 06:06.109
Come on.

06:06.144 --> 06:07.710
Wow. This is great, Ben.

06:07.745 --> 06:08.946
What an amazing opportunity.

06:08.980 --> 06:10.047
I know, right?

06:10.081 --> 06:11.348
Oh, crap!

06:11.382 --> 06:14.017
It's that girl from last night.
What is she doing here?

06:14.052 --> 06:18.187
Well, alcohol is a known way
to remove unwanted memories.

06:18.221 --> 06:20.189
No. This is not good.

06:20.223 --> 06:22.224
What if she makes a scene in
front of my potential new boss

06:22.259 --> 06:24.293
when she finds out I work
here and not up there?

06:25.329 --> 06:28.097
You told her you were God?

06:29.967 --> 06:31.468
- Hey! Hi!
- You!

06:31.502 --> 06:33.474
Look, I'm super flattered that
you're trying to track me down,

06:33.574 --> 06:34.908
but now is not a good time.

06:34.942 --> 06:36.242
And I'm not actually a pilot.

06:36.277 --> 06:38.945
No, it's okay.
I'm not actually new to the big city.

06:38.980 --> 06:41.114
But there's something you should know.

06:41.149 --> 06:41.864
There you are.

06:41.964 --> 06:44.299
I see you've met my wife.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.901
Your... your... your what?

06:46.935 --> 06:48.369
My wife.

06:48.403 --> 06:50.838
Yeah, that's what I thought you said.

06:53.976 --> 06:55.710
See? This...

06:55.744 --> 06:57.912
This is why I don't do bad things

06:57.947 --> 07:00.815
because it always come
back to bite me in the ass.

07:00.849 --> 07:03.751
No, that's exactly why you do bad things.

07:03.786 --> 07:05.687
To get bitten on the ass.

07:07.389 --> 07:09.156
Look, you need to just take control

07:09.191 --> 07:11.435
and get out there and act
like nothing happened.

07:14.271 --> 07:16.472
Sorry to interrupt.

07:16.507 --> 07:17.573
Riley?

07:17.608 --> 07:19.909
Ross?

07:19.943 --> 07:23.845
You're this Riley? Riley Perrin?

07:23.880 --> 07:26.448
In the flesh.

07:26.482 --> 07:29.618
Though not-not as much as, uh...

07:29.652 --> 07:30.717
As last night.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.018
Are you suing someone?

07:32.052 --> 07:37.456
Because our clients are always satisfied.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.057
Legally speaking.

07:39.091 --> 07:40.392
Yeah, that's good to know.

07:40.426 --> 07:42.461
Um, I'm not a client.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.929
I'm the new managing partner.

07:46.332 --> 07:48.800
You're my boss?

07:48.834 --> 07:51.036
Guilty.

07:51.070 --> 07:55.707
Well, I guess I can cancel our
"getting to know you" lunch.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.742
Great first day.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.618
Oh, wow!

08:06.653 --> 08:08.320
You are definitely gonna remember

08:08.354 --> 08:11.022
your first one-night stand.

08:16.028 --> 08:17.796
You slept with his wife?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.431
How could you not know she was married?

08:19.465 --> 08:21.032
Well, it's not like it's on my standard

08:21.066 --> 08:23.368
"getting to know you" questionnaire.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.805
Are you willing?

08:26.839 --> 08:29.507
Hey, she's got way more to lose than you,
so just be cool.

08:29.541 --> 08:31.009
I'm sure everything will be fine.

08:31.043 --> 08:33.744
I gotta tell you, Ben, I really like
the look of things around here.

08:33.779 --> 08:36.914
Yeah. Best job in my wife... life.

08:36.948 --> 08:38.616
I don't have a wife. You have a wife.

08:38.650 --> 08:39.784
What were you saying?

08:39.818 --> 08:42.017
Jessica actually came in last night.

08:42.116 --> 08:42.908
I always send her in first

08:43.008 --> 08:44.742
to inspect the place and the employees.

08:44.776 --> 08:46.343
She said she was very satisfied.

08:49.947 --> 08:50.918
Hey, what's up, Ben?

08:52.748 --> 08:54.114
Hey, wait, don't I know you?

08:55.116 --> 08:58.118
No. Uh, no, I don't think so.

08:58.153 --> 09:00.788
Yeah! Yeah! Ben's hot hook-up!

09:00.823 --> 09:03.190
Yeah! Naked lady from the bathroom!

09:03.224 --> 09:05.492
Oh, I got your earring, by the way.

09:05.526 --> 09:07.461
- Excuse me!
- Who are you?

09:07.495 --> 09:09.059
Naked lady's husband?

09:10.384 --> 09:12.385
Wow.

09:12.419 --> 09:13.786
This is even more awkward

09:13.820 --> 09:15.588
than when we ran into each
other in the bathroom.

09:21.255 --> 09:23.255
Hey, I hope that couch
Cushion's got a seat belt,

09:23.280 --> 09:25.849
'cause Emma is about to blow you away.

09:25.883 --> 09:27.950
Go, girl.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.852
Oh, my God!

09:29.886 --> 09:32.388
You taught her that? You're a genius!

09:32.422 --> 09:33.522
That's the coolest thing ever!

09:33.556 --> 09:35.757
I know, right? Bro, I think I won.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.460
I think you did, too.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.395
It's done. Over.

09:39.429 --> 09:41.763
Life, career, future,
all officially ruined,

09:41.798 --> 09:44.132
all for a couple of stupid seconds of fun.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.101
Seconds?

09:46.135 --> 09:49.905
I was excited. She was new. It happens.

09:49.939 --> 09:51.773
I can't believe I'm so stupid.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.308
Now that Ian's backing out,

09:53.342 --> 09:56.144
everyone at the bar is blaming
me for losing their job.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.947
I wish there was someone else.

09:58.982 --> 10:00.448
Hey, either of you want to buy a bar?

10:00.483 --> 10:02.917
Uh, I would, but, you know,

10:02.951 --> 10:05.620
I just bought three hotels and a rail road,
so...

10:05.654 --> 10:08.523
I just need to figure out
how to get Ian back on board.

10:08.557 --> 10:09.824
How about an apology?

10:09.858 --> 10:10.883
No. No, that's stupid.

10:11.772 --> 10:13.439
You know
what I'm gonna do instead?

10:13.473 --> 10:16.241
I'm gonna go over there and
tell him I'm sorry. Yep.

10:16.276 --> 10:17.276
Wish me luck.

10:18.812 --> 10:20.279
That's really nice, Danny.

10:20.313 --> 10:22.014
Would you mind not burping
in front of my kid?

10:22.048 --> 10:23.948
The last thing I want is for
her to pick up that bad habit.

10:24.048 --> 10:25.115
Sorry, dude.

10:26.985 --> 10:28.152
Do it again, Emma.

10:29.688 --> 10:33.356
This is so great! Good job!

10:34.358 --> 10:35.458
Let's face it.

10:35.493 --> 10:38.796
I've ruined my future here
for 30 minutes of fun.

10:38.830 --> 10:40.597
30 minutes?

10:40.631 --> 10:42.632
Well, he's a little older, so...

10:42.667 --> 10:44.134
Yeah.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.620
Look, I'm telling you, you're overreacting.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.120
This is a huge firm.

10:50.154 --> 10:51.788
You'll hardly ever see each other.

10:52.890 --> 10:54.658
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:54.692 --> 10:56.292
Oh, you're still busy.

10:56.327 --> 10:58.862
Uh, yes, I'm with a client.

10:58.896 --> 10:59.885
Oh.

10:59.985 --> 11:01.285
Bonnie Van Doren,

11:01.319 --> 11:03.320
heiress to a huge pickle fortune.

11:03.355 --> 11:05.389
I'm thinking of bringing my business here.

11:05.423 --> 11:07.557
So, do we have a "dill?"

11:09.527 --> 11:13.330
Seriously, I'm not "gherkin" around.

11:14.532 --> 11:16.062
Uh, I just wanted you to know

11:16.162 --> 11:19.164
that I'm putting you on the
team for the Anderson case.

11:19.198 --> 11:20.498
That's pretty much it.

11:22.634 --> 11:24.169
My God, the Anderson case?

11:24.203 --> 11:26.171
Oh, man, that son of a bitch.

11:26.205 --> 11:27.838
This is the best case of the firm.

11:27.873 --> 11:30.542
Ugh, that hot piece of man meat.

11:30.576 --> 11:32.379
You know, obviously,

11:32.379 --> 11:34.545
he only gave this to me
because we slept together.

11:34.645 --> 11:36.179
Oh, my God!

11:36.214 --> 11:38.170
I can't believe I have
turned into that girl.

11:38.270 --> 11:39.904
You know, that girl who only gets ahead

11:39.938 --> 11:41.571
by sleeping her way to the top.

11:41.606 --> 11:44.942
Jody Montez, the new head of accounting,
is that girl.

11:44.976 --> 11:46.911
God, I hate that girl.

11:46.945 --> 11:48.813
I don't know what you're complaining about.

11:48.847 --> 11:51.401
Hot boyfriend, big promotion, 30 minutes.

11:51.501 --> 11:53.135
I think you won.

11:58.532 --> 12:00.100
Ben.

12:00.134 --> 12:01.501
If you're looking for Jessica,

12:01.535 --> 12:02.776
she's sleeping with the fishes.

12:02.876 --> 12:05.510
Oh, my God! You had her killed?

12:05.545 --> 12:08.347
No, Bill and Sara Fish.
They have a guesthouse.

12:08.381 --> 12:11.516
Ian, please, we need to talk.

12:11.551 --> 12:13.390
Look, I know you're not going
to accept an apology from me.

12:13.490 --> 12:15.090
I wouldn't.

12:15.124 --> 12:17.292
You probably want to kick my ass.

12:17.327 --> 12:19.729
Again, I wouldn't.

12:19.763 --> 12:22.732
But look, the Bar on B
is a good investment.

12:22.766 --> 12:24.766
Won't you please reconsider?

12:24.800 --> 12:26.735
If not for me,
for everyone else who works there.

12:26.769 --> 12:29.171
And if you do, I will quit,

12:29.205 --> 12:30.939
and you'll never have to see my face again.

12:30.974 --> 12:33.375
So you would sacrifice
your own job to make sure

12:33.409 --> 12:36.211
the people you work with
have a steady paycheck?

12:36.246 --> 12:37.913
Yeah. I'm noble like that.

12:37.947 --> 12:40.715
Okay. I'll reconsider.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.884
But you may want to consider a new career.

12:42.918 --> 12:46.020
I have a feeling your
bartending days are over.

12:46.054 --> 12:48.189
I'm vengeful like that.

12:53.722 --> 12:55.756
You want to know what my plan is?

12:55.791 --> 12:57.591
I'm gonna drink all the beer in the world.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.686
That way, Ian has nothing to sell,

12:59.786 --> 13:02.309
goes out of business and calls
me back in for help. Yep.

13:04.535 --> 13:06.069
You should be proud of yourself.

13:06.103 --> 13:08.571
You actually tried to do
something right for other people.

13:08.605 --> 13:10.363
You're a good bartender.
You'll find something.

13:10.607 --> 13:14.677
I've already tried,
but Ian's put out the word out on me.

13:14.711 --> 13:15.636
I've been to half the bars in the city.

13:15.736 --> 13:17.870
No one's gonna hire me.

13:17.905 --> 13:19.573
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:19.607 --> 13:23.643
I'm gonna go tell my daughter
that her eating days are over.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.777
I'll put her to bed.

13:24.812 --> 13:26.746
She doesn't need to see you like this.

13:26.780 --> 13:29.215
Hey, you know I'll always be
there for you and Emma, right?

13:29.249 --> 13:31.550
I know. Thanks, man.

13:31.585 --> 13:34.487
Hey, I'm tagging in. What'd I miss?

13:34.521 --> 13:36.318
He's mad, he's sad. He's a bad dad.

13:36.418 --> 13:38.053
He's basically a Dr. Seuss book.

13:41.991 --> 13:43.625
Pfft, good one.

13:43.659 --> 13:46.160
I can't believe I'm gonna be out of a job!

13:46.194 --> 13:48.429
Bar on B was nothing when I started.

13:48.464 --> 13:50.431
It's gonna be nothing when I leave.

13:50.466 --> 13:53.501
I'm the one who came up
with trivia Tuesday.

13:53.535 --> 13:56.704
I'm the one who invented the Bar on B-tini.

13:56.739 --> 13:59.641
I'm the reason every
night is ladies' night!

13:59.675 --> 14:02.243
Girls love me!

14:04.112 --> 14:07.282
Which is kind of why we're here now.

14:07.316 --> 14:08.916
Exactly.

14:08.950 --> 14:10.451
You know what the "B" stands for, Tucker?

14:10.486 --> 14:12.620
I'm guessing you're gonna say Ben.

14:12.655 --> 14:14.555
See, you get me. You know what I'm saying?

14:19.980 --> 14:24.083
Man, they don't pay us enough, am I right?

14:24.117 --> 14:26.250
Mrs. Wheeler, what are
you doing here again?

14:26.320 --> 14:28.255
What does it look like I'm doing here?

14:28.289 --> 14:29.889
Checking on you.

14:29.923 --> 14:30.911
That's what it looks like, right?

14:32.026 --> 14:35.061
What am I supposed to do about this case?

14:35.095 --> 14:36.386
Well, I'm not a lawyer,

14:36.486 --> 14:39.288
but I'm gonna go with "win it."

14:40.523 --> 14:42.925
No, the case is not the problem.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.893
How I got the case is.

14:44.928 --> 14:47.830
Well, then give it back.

14:47.864 --> 14:52.200
You need to tell him that you
are not that kind of girl.

14:52.234 --> 14:55.236
That you are just as smart and talented

14:55.271 --> 14:56.980
as every other lawyer in this building,

14:57.174 --> 15:00.043
and that you will earn
your cases the right way,

15:00.077 --> 15:02.912
by standing up for
yourself and your clients.

15:02.946 --> 15:06.348
You need to demand to be judged
by your skills in the courtroom,

15:06.382 --> 15:09.351
not the bedroom.

15:09.385 --> 15:10.986
I rest my case.

15:12.289 --> 15:13.489
You know what?

15:13.524 --> 15:16.725
That is exactly what I am going to do.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.528
You actually would have
made a really good lawyer.

15:18.562 --> 15:19.895
I know, right?

15:22.933 --> 15:25.968
Hold still, man!

15:26.002 --> 15:27.235
I can't get it down if you keep

15:27.270 --> 15:30.005
wobbling around like some drunk guy.

15:30.040 --> 15:33.008
Oh, wait, you are some drunk guy!

15:34.744 --> 15:37.478
Wait! Wait! I got it! I got it!

15:37.578 --> 15:41.347
No. No, I haven't got it. I haven't got it.

15:44.523 --> 15:46.490
- We got it!
- We got it!

15:53.498 --> 15:55.432
- I have something to say to you.
- Not a good time.

15:55.466 --> 15:57.701
How about I decide if it's a good time,
okay?

15:57.735 --> 16:00.303
Look, I know that you just gave me
this case because we slept together.

16:00.337 --> 16:01.572
- Riley.
- No, no, no!

16:01.606 --> 16:03.339
Please.
Please do not interrupt me, all right?

16:03.374 --> 16:05.075
Just admit it. We had sex.

16:05.109 --> 16:07.544
You felt guilty, so you gave me this case

16:07.579 --> 16:09.012
to make yourself feel better.

16:09.047 --> 16:10.113
Well, guess what?

16:10.147 --> 16:12.715
I'm not Jody Montez, okay?

16:12.749 --> 16:15.151
I am a lawyer, and a damn good one,

16:15.186 --> 16:17.320
and I don't need to earn
my place at this firm

16:17.354 --> 16:20.490
by banging the new partner!

16:20.524 --> 16:22.325
Am I clear?

16:22.359 --> 16:25.095
Clear to me.

16:25.129 --> 16:27.810
And to our associates in Chicago,
London and Tokyo.

16:34.067 --> 16:36.536
Hi, guys.

16:36.570 --> 16:37.570
Jody.

16:39.673 --> 16:41.841
Congratulations on the promotion.

16:48.648 --> 16:52.117
Yeah. This guy's totally going to jail.

16:59.325 --> 17:02.194
Oh, jeez.

17:02.229 --> 17:05.196
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

17:05.232 --> 17:07.566
I embarrassed myself
across three continents!

17:07.599 --> 17:08.488
- Riley.
- No, no, no!

17:08.588 --> 17:10.222
Not only did I humiliate myself,

17:10.256 --> 17:13.458
but I managed to just splatter
you with collateral humiliation.

17:13.492 --> 17:15.460
I'm so, so sorry.

17:15.494 --> 17:16.029
Riley...

17:16.128 --> 17:18.763
the last thing I wanted was to
create any more problems for you.

17:18.798 --> 17:20.098
So, look, I know what you have to do,

17:20.133 --> 17:21.400
and I will just make it easy on you.

17:21.434 --> 17:22.867
I will pack up my office tonight,

17:22.902 --> 17:24.270
and you will have my letter of...

17:24.304 --> 17:26.204
counselor!

17:26.239 --> 17:28.339
I am not going to fire you.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.308
No one is.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.811
I didn't put you on this case
because we slept together.

17:32.845 --> 17:35.147
I did it because you're
smart and well-respected.

17:35.181 --> 17:37.783
I made that decision before I even met you.

17:37.817 --> 17:40.085
Really?

17:40.119 --> 17:42.553
Really.

17:42.588 --> 17:44.656
So, look, I know I'm... I'm an idiot.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.591
I mean,
I spent my entire day locked in my office

17:46.625 --> 17:48.459
not knowing what to do or what to say.

17:48.494 --> 17:50.495
Me, too.

17:50.529 --> 17:52.297
You should have just come talk to me.

17:52.331 --> 17:54.632
I should have. I just...

17:54.667 --> 17:56.901
Look, I'm not very good at this.

17:56.935 --> 17:58.703
And I want you to know that
I'm not the type of guy

17:58.737 --> 18:00.061
who goes around having one-night stands.

18:00.161 --> 18:02.762
I mean,
I am definitely never doing that again.

18:02.797 --> 18:04.831
Not because of you. I mean...

18:04.866 --> 18:07.467
I would with you again.
That was incredible.

18:09.937 --> 18:12.839
Well, you know, there... Is a way

18:12.874 --> 18:15.809
to make this not a one-night stand.

18:15.843 --> 18:19.751
We could make it a two-night
stand and go from there.

18:22.088 --> 18:24.557
Really?

18:24.591 --> 18:27.514
Would you like to go out with me again?

18:27.894 --> 18:29.520
Yeah.

18:30.297 --> 18:32.531
Yeah, I'd like that very much.

18:36.202 --> 18:39.070
Oh, hey, guys! Hey! Hey!

18:39.105 --> 18:40.839
Nice to see you again, Ross.

18:40.874 --> 18:42.641
Um, you know what, Riley?

18:42.675 --> 18:44.142
That was some really good advice,

18:44.176 --> 18:47.278
you know, to sit in a dark
place and collect my thoughts.

18:47.313 --> 18:51.282
Um, I-I think my pickles
will be very happy here.

18:51.317 --> 18:52.841
Um, so listen, uh,

18:52.941 --> 18:54.742
I've got a Kosher conference in Long Island

18:54.776 --> 18:56.477
that I've got to get to, so, I got to...

18:56.511 --> 18:57.511
bye-bye!

19:03.685 --> 19:04.685
Ben!

19:04.720 --> 19:07.054
Dude! Do you have to be so loud?

19:07.088 --> 19:09.223
Aah!

19:09.257 --> 19:11.959
Do I have to be so loud?

19:11.993 --> 19:15.996
Damn, I was hoping I dreamt that.

19:16.030 --> 19:19.532
Uh-oh. I think I know what the
"B" stands for.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.401
Oh!

19:23.404 --> 19:25.138
I really am a dumb-ass.

19:25.173 --> 19:28.375
Yeah. I mean, who steals a
sign from their own bar?

19:28.409 --> 19:31.678
You know what?
I deserve this sign because...

19:31.712 --> 19:32.812
what'd you say?

19:32.847 --> 19:34.581
I said it's your bar.

19:34.615 --> 19:36.316
Actually it's ours.

19:36.351 --> 19:38.018
I outbid Ian Hughes.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.419
I just got back from the bank.

19:39.453 --> 19:41.855
Congratulations. We
officially own Bar on B.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.624
What? You bought the bar?

19:44.658 --> 19:45.745
Why would you do that?

19:45.845 --> 19:47.780
'Cause you're my brother,

19:47.814 --> 19:49.581
and I care about your future.

19:49.616 --> 19:51.951
Plus, I don't know how long they're
going to pay me to play hockey.

19:51.985 --> 19:54.420
So this way,
I've got my future covered, too.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.121
Dude...

19:56.155 --> 19:57.423
Oh...

19:58.925 --> 20:00.125
I don't know what to say.

20:00.159 --> 20:02.227
How about "let's go put our sign back?"

20:02.261 --> 20:05.096
Yes. Totally.

20:08.860 --> 20:10.860
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

20:10.885 --> 20:12.952
- Okay, guess I'll see you at work.
- Okay.

20:12.987 --> 20:16.189
- Riley?
- Ben! Ben! Hi!

20:16.223 --> 20:17.391
Uh, you're up early.

20:17.425 --> 20:18.759
This is Ross.

20:18.793 --> 20:21.427
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Don't engage.

20:23.397 --> 20:26.465
So, when you said you were
waiting at the bar for hours,

20:26.500 --> 20:27.700
you left out the part where you were

20:27.734 --> 20:29.735
waiting at home naked in bed.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.137
Hey, you know what? Fine.

20:31.172 --> 20:33.206
I shot and scored. Are you happy?

20:35.276 --> 20:37.410
Ben, eww. Oh, my God.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.478
You're teaching Emma
some great manners there.

20:39.513 --> 20:40.979
That wasn't me!

20:41.014 --> 20:43.248
Danny!
I told you to stop burping around Emma!

20:43.283 --> 20:46.852
Uh, you bought the bar.
You know, forget it. We're cool.
