00:35.076 --> 00:36.668
The tone of the warm-up's changed.

00:36.845 --> 00:39.109
That's because she had
a late night last night.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.241
Means Jay's back on the scene.

00:45.287 --> 00:47.221
You know what?
We should all go out tonight.

00:47.322 --> 00:48.890
Check out some fresh moves.

00:48.891 --> 00:51.226
- Yeah, I'm on that.
- Now you're talking.

00:51.227 --> 00:52.693
Yeah, I think so.

01:43.611 --> 01:46.045
- Do you want a drink?
- I don't drink.

01:47.082 --> 01:48.447
So, what do you do?

01:49.651 --> 01:50.811
I dance.

01:51.286 --> 01:52.548
I can work with that.

02:02.797 --> 02:04.958
Hello, babe.
Do you wanna dance?

02:12.040 --> 02:13.007
Shall we?

02:34.596 --> 02:38.088
Oh, yeah, right now you're seeing it
with your own eyes.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.096
Ladies, make way. Make way.

02:41.936 --> 02:43.961
I swear they must get off on
those uniforms.

02:45.473 --> 02:48.209
It's the UK National Champs.

02:48.210 --> 02:49.972
It's the Surge, baby.

02:50.478 --> 02:52.969
- Let's get the others.
- The dance floor's open.

02:53.214 --> 02:56.342
Anybody feels they want to step up
to the challenge, it's on you.

02:57.452 --> 02:59.283
Let's see what you can do.
Let's do this thing.

03:06.828 --> 03:08.455
So, what's the name of the game?

03:08.963 --> 03:12.956
It's not a game, it's a battle.
Just throw down some moves.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.758
Let's get it popping, let's go!

03:39.727 --> 03:42.321
Do you know what I'm saying?
UK champs, baby.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.090
Alright, what we got here?
What we got here?

03:50.638 --> 03:51.730
Are we ready?

03:52.941 --> 03:55.171
Alright, then. Let's go.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.492
Did you see that?

04:33.081 --> 04:34.105
Ladies?

04:37.552 --> 04:39.645
Okay, the ladies are
getting involved now.

04:56.571 --> 04:58.232
Hold it. Hold on.
What is it?

05:00.675 --> 05:02.540
There's ballet in the building!

05:04.712 --> 05:07.340
I don't know, man.
It kind of works, too.

05:11.152 --> 05:13.354
I think that's called a pirouette,
or something.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.117
I don't know.
But, it's all good.

05:19.127 --> 05:20.560
See what Surge can do.

05:31.306 --> 05:33.001
Oh, there's your girl.

05:33.308 --> 05:34.468
We're going aerial.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.166
360 aerial, baby!

06:12.480 --> 06:13.777
Yeah. What have you got?

06:31.833 --> 06:35.997
I don't know the name of this crew,
but I'm looking for these people, for real!

06:36.571 --> 06:37.663
That was cheeky.

07:03.865 --> 07:06.425
My God, this is getting
messy man. This is getting crazy.

07:09.037 --> 07:11.130
Hey, all my people,
how are you feeling?

07:16.678 --> 07:19.010
Boy, I wish I could lift
my arse up to do that.

07:26.387 --> 07:29.288
Make me some noise for that move right
there. I'm not joking with you people.

07:32.126 --> 07:33.093
What you got?

07:34.962 --> 07:36.486
Alright, Surge. It's on you.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.678
Don't touch him...
you're not worth it.

08:23.679 --> 08:25.578
You didn't mind touching me
last night, though.

08:28.483 --> 08:30.246
Hold it down, hold it down.

09:17.064 --> 09:18.088
It's okay.

09:46.928 --> 09:48.190
Welcome to my world.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.492
College fees don't leave
a lot left over for fancy apartments.

10:23.030 --> 10:25.055
It does have one redeeming feature.

10:28.202 --> 10:29.191
What?

10:33.641 --> 10:35.973
- Close your eyes.
- Don't be silly.

10:36.711 --> 10:37.575
Come on.

11:05.740 --> 11:06.729
Open your eyes.

11:11.245 --> 11:12.507
That's not bad, is it?

11:14.081 --> 11:15.378
It's beautiful.

11:23.658 --> 11:25.216
This is where
I do my street dancing.

11:27.762 --> 11:28.729
What?

11:29.864 --> 11:31.024
Alright, check this out.

11:32.533 --> 11:33.830
Honestly, what? Ready?

11:43.444 --> 11:45.776
Alright, a bit more practice...

11:46.280 --> 11:47.975
but, I tell you,
we'll beat those Surge guys.

11:52.486 --> 11:53.783
No, we can't.

11:55.089 --> 11:57.319
Who am I kidding?
They're the best at what they do.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.191
So do something different.

12:00.161 --> 12:01.389
What do you mean?

12:03.297 --> 12:07.097
You've got five ballet dancers
in your crew... use us.

12:07.368 --> 12:10.360
- What, put ballet and street together?
- Yeah, why not?

12:10.571 --> 12:13.540
- It doesn't go.
- How do you know?

12:19.013 --> 12:19.945
Come on.

12:22.583 --> 12:23.743
What are you doing?

12:25.486 --> 12:26.680
Put me down.

12:27.888 --> 12:30.152
- Now look what you've made me do.
- Oh, God. Come on.

16:08.609 --> 16:11.077
Can everyone come together please,
I've got something to say.

16:17.251 --> 16:19.219
To those of you who know Jay...

16:20.154 --> 16:22.088
...he didn't think
we were good enough.

16:23.390 --> 16:26.917
He didn't think we could
beat the Surge, so he joined them.

16:27.061 --> 16:29.461
- Low life.
- And to the rest of you...

16:29.563 --> 16:32.657
I've been trying to fit you
into a Surge shaped box...

16:32.967 --> 16:35.458
...and I'm sorry,
we're never going to fit.

16:39.340 --> 16:41.308
We're going to do something different.

16:48.182 --> 16:49.945
I want us to be ourselves.

16:51.085 --> 16:52.643
Just be our best.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.785
Whether that's dancing ballet
or dancing street.

16:57.524 --> 17:01.016
We'll mix it all up.
Make something beautiful.

17:01.962 --> 17:04.795
And we'll win the competition
because of who we are.

17:06.834 --> 17:07.993
So, what we called?

17:09.270 --> 17:10.635
Breaking Point.

17:11.338 --> 17:14.535
Letters of concern
from Isabella's mother...

17:14.642 --> 17:17.744
from Chloe's very rich and
very generous father...

17:17.746 --> 17:21.875
...worried that your street dance experiment
is unsettling their daughter's training.

17:22.348 --> 17:24.385
They needed to be unsettled.

17:24.386 --> 17:27.554
You are corrupting the discipline
of our best students.

17:27.555 --> 17:31.217
I don't like to question your methods,
but this does seem willfully perverse.

17:31.558 --> 17:34.425
Is it a mid life crisis?

17:35.996 --> 17:40.194
The street dancers were bouncing off
the walls when they came in here.

17:41.001 --> 17:43.737
Wouldn't you like to see that kind of
exuberance in our students?

17:43.738 --> 17:45.068
Hey, hey. Non.

17:45.205 --> 17:47.571
It could transform their performances.

17:47.741 --> 17:49.402
And vandalise the college.

17:49.643 --> 17:51.577
Look, I'm calling time on this Helena.

17:51.712 --> 17:55.011
We must focus on getting
them into the best ballet companies.

17:55.082 --> 17:57.175
And for that they need fire.

17:57.785 --> 18:00.151
Believe me,
we all want the same thing.

18:04.525 --> 18:06.117
Carry on,
we're just observing.

18:08.662 --> 18:10.323
Found this class useful, Tomas?

18:11.065 --> 18:12.225
It's invaluable, sir.

18:13.334 --> 18:14.665
Carly is excellent.

18:23.110 --> 18:23.974
Chloe?

18:24.578 --> 18:28.070
Dope? I mean, very educational.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.154
Much more joie de vivre,
n'est pas?

18:42.997 --> 18:46.990
I think I can see how that might
put some attitude into their attitudes.

18:48.635 --> 18:50.728
Very good.
Please carry on, Helena.

18:50.871 --> 18:54.742
But Monsieur, being dopey won't
get them into the Royal Ballet.

18:54.743 --> 18:56.073
Enough, Madame.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.608
- Is everything alright?
- Yes, good.

18:59.913 --> 19:00.971
Good work.

19:02.416 --> 19:04.543
You knew we'd gel eventually,
didn't you?

19:04.752 --> 19:06.276
Honestly? No.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.916
Sometimes you just have to try things.

22:09.803 --> 22:11.361
The Royal Ballet list must be in!

22:14.942 --> 22:17.308
- Rebecca!
- That's amazing.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.606
What day are the
street dance finals?

22:23.850 --> 22:26.987
- Who submitted them for this date?
- Does it matter?

22:26.988 --> 22:27.955
It's the Royal Ballet.

22:27.956 --> 22:30.446
The same day as their
street dance performance.

22:30.657 --> 22:31.817
Is that an issue?

22:34.061 --> 22:35.722
It was Madame Fleurie, wasn't it?

22:36.330 --> 22:38.355
We all want the same thing, Helena.

22:44.638 --> 22:45.969
Well done, young lady.

22:46.673 --> 22:47.605
Helena.

22:48.709 --> 22:50.108
I didn't know, Carly.

22:51.511 --> 22:53.138
So, what you gonna do
about it, then?

22:53.513 --> 22:55.310
Unfortunately,
there's not much I can do.

22:56.450 --> 22:58.543
This has been the plan all along,
hasn't it?

23:00.120 --> 23:03.612
Get some mugs in to liven up
your deadweight dancers and then drop them.

23:03.824 --> 23:05.257
I didn't plan this.

23:06.727 --> 23:08.661
Carly, there's something you
have to understand.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.125
These auditions are their
street dance final.

23:12.366 --> 23:13.560
And what about ours?

23:14.568 --> 23:18.338
Why did you take me to the ballet and
feed me all that 'this is dance' rubbish,

23:18.339 --> 23:20.670
knowing that you'd shaft us
in a second?

23:39.526 --> 23:40.550
We know.

23:42.896 --> 23:46.127
- They don't have to do their audition.
- Of course they do.

23:47.734 --> 23:50.137
They've been training
for this their whole lives.

23:50.138 --> 23:51.968
Carly, we can do both.

23:52.105 --> 23:54.608
We'll do the auditions and
be there easily by four.

23:54.609 --> 23:57.668
- Do you think?
- Yes, definitely.

23:59.379 --> 24:01.404
Then go and rehearse.
Be brilliant.

24:02.516 --> 24:04.279
We'll brain you
if you don't get in.

24:15.228 --> 24:16.456
We'll be there.

24:17.597 --> 24:18.586
Go on.

24:24.371 --> 24:25.565
What if they don't make it?

25:54.261 --> 25:55.990
Good afternoon, Britain.

25:59.199 --> 26:01.030
Yo. Are we having fun?

26:01.268 --> 26:03.133
Good, good, good.
Having a good time?

26:04.504 --> 26:06.740
There's only two crews left.

26:06.741 --> 26:10.107
Next on stage,
reigning champions, The Surge.

26:12.646 --> 26:14.773
We're on next,
but they're not here yet.

26:14.881 --> 26:15.711
I knew it.

26:16.483 --> 26:18.151
Why don't we just go on anyway?

26:18.152 --> 26:20.813
- What? Are you stupid?
- Come on, guys.

26:21.354 --> 26:24.524
If we start tearing each other apart
again, it's all been for nothing.

26:24.525 --> 26:27.118
- You know, she's right.
- Yeah, man. Come on, guys.

26:33.700 --> 26:36.760
If we want to be
with them we have to go now.

26:41.741 --> 26:42.901
Looking good.

26:43.276 --> 26:45.710
Your old friend Michael's
on the audition panel.

30:09.749 --> 30:11.216
Who liked The Surge?

30:12.619 --> 30:16.077
Don't get too happy though, they haven't
won that trip to America just yet.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.816
It's time for our last crew.

30:18.224 --> 30:19.885
Breaking Point!

30:23.463 --> 30:25.829
Come on, Breaking Point.
Don't be shy.

30:36.609 --> 30:37.667
Come on.

30:40.714 --> 30:42.944
On stage now,
or you’re disqualified.

30:46.152 --> 30:47.915
Buck up, babe.
They'll be here.

31:02.168 --> 31:04.966
Okay, must be
an additional item here.

31:09.943 --> 31:17.748
Who are you? Who are you?

31:33.299 --> 31:35.199
When did Eddie learn those moves?

31:35.335 --> 31:36.666
A bit of old school.

31:46.713 --> 31:47.873
Go on Eddie!

32:23.016 --> 32:24.176
Where are they?

32:24.918 --> 32:26.920
- They've gone.
- Gone? Gone where?

32:26.921 --> 32:28.979
- To their performance.
- What?

32:29.189 --> 32:32.258
To that thing... that, that... nothing!

32:32.259 --> 32:35.227
No, not that nothing,
Madame, that dance.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.554
You have ruined their career.

32:37.831 --> 32:40.061
- What the hell is going on?
- Ask her.

32:40.300 --> 32:41.699
I wash my hand.

32:43.069 --> 32:44.263
You start talking.

32:47.607 --> 32:50.132
- Michael?
- Helena!

32:55.415 --> 32:57.042
How long is he going to
stay out there?

33:32.886 --> 33:35.150
What is this?
Extreme auditioning?

33:41.427 --> 33:44.726
I heard you're ditching, Carly.
Bad luck.

33:45.331 --> 33:46.855
Get your hands off me.

33:47.433 --> 33:49.697
Too bad we won't be seeing you
on that winner's podium.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.030
Who cares?

33:52.272 --> 33:55.105
We don't need some tacky bit of
metal to prove we're winners.

33:55.308 --> 33:58.675
You can say it,
but I know you don't mean it.

33:59.879 --> 34:01.506
I feel sorry for you, Jay.

34:02.715 --> 34:06.048
A bit part player in someone else's
crew for the sake of winning?

34:07.954 --> 34:09.649
I thought you had more ambition.

34:12.625 --> 34:14.024
Can I have the next dance?

34:35.815 --> 34:38.215
OK. Breaking Point,
this is your last chance!

35:21.627 --> 35:23.458
- What?
- You're not serious?

35:27.500 --> 35:28.558
What is this?

35:33.406 --> 35:34.338
What?

36:04.037 --> 36:05.504
Bruv, we've won this.
