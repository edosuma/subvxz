00:03.370 --> 00:04.337
Hey, check out that one.

00:04.471 --> 00:06.405
You see those markings?

00:06.506 --> 00:07.939
It's a classic Appaloosa mustang.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.066
Come on, let's go!

00:10.176 --> 00:11.268
Go on!

00:11.378 --> 00:13.369
It's a wild horse, Amy.
Not easy to gentle.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.076
Let me at least try.

00:16.181 --> 00:19.174
My own corporate equine retreat.

00:19.285 --> 00:20.946
In other words, a dude ranch.

00:21.054 --> 00:22.112
Surprise!

00:22.889 --> 00:24.356
Happy birthday, honey.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.549
I wanted to thank you
for giving me a chance.

00:26.726 --> 00:28.591
You know, I've got a lot of years
to make up for.

00:28.762 --> 00:31.663
- Dad, it's okay.
- I do and I will.

00:35.602 --> 00:36.660
Hey, Jack.

00:40.173 --> 00:42.073
Why did you bring him here,
Grandpa?

00:50.083 --> 00:51.607
AMY:
Run him up to the fence.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.186
CALEB: Well, I'm trying,
but somebody put this tree in my way.

00:54.287 --> 00:55.413
Nearly poked out an eye.

00:55.522 --> 00:58.457
AMY: Oh, come on, Caleb!
Cowboy up!

00:59.492 --> 01:01.585

01:15.308 --> 01:17.276
Good boy!

01:19.913 --> 01:22.040
That's it. Just keep moving.

01:22.148 --> 01:23.843
I got him cornered.

01:23.950 --> 01:26.817
Oh, yeah? Like you had him cornered
when you let him out of the pen?

01:26.986 --> 01:28.214
CALEB:
I thought I had it settled.

01:28.321 --> 01:30.221
AMY:
Oh, well, you were wrong.

01:30.323 --> 01:32.518
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:32.692 --> 01:35.786
I guess he moved faster
than I thought he would.

01:37.964 --> 01:38.931
MALLORY: Go left!

01:39.065 --> 01:40.828
No, go right!

01:44.404 --> 01:46.133
Do you want me to help?

01:46.239 --> 01:48.434
Mallory, stay right there!

01:48.575 --> 01:49.564
Come on!

01:49.709 --> 01:51.301
Amy, I don't think he likes you.

01:53.513 --> 01:54.639
Hey.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.245
Hey.

02:04.891 --> 02:06.552
I figure we could use another hand.

02:06.659 --> 02:09.184
Okay, Mallory,
if you want to do something...

02:18.671 --> 02:20.332
Welcome home?

02:25.445 --> 02:30.348
I guess I better get to work.
Don't want to wear out that welcome.

02:37.323 --> 02:40.417
Arert you supposed to be doing
something with that mustang?

02:40.527 --> 02:41.551
I'm off the clock.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.787
Oh, really?

02:42.896 --> 02:46.992
And how long do you think
that is gonna last?

02:47.100 --> 02:49.568
How long have you got?

02:50.937 --> 02:52.905
Hey, Scott.

02:53.773 --> 02:55.365
Amy needs you in the field.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.507
I'd say about five seconds.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.436
Wait here. I'll be back.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.344
Uh-huh.

03:07.921 --> 03:08.945
While you're waiting,

03:09.055 --> 03:11.353
what are we gonna do
about the Ty-Caleb situation?

03:11.457 --> 03:14.085
What are we gonna do
about the what?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.526
You know. Ty's back.

03:16.696 --> 03:19.324
And Caleb doesn't know about...
you know.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.059
Well, the only thing I know

03:21.167 --> 03:23.727
is if I was hoping to stay
somewhere all summer,

03:23.903 --> 03:25.871
I might consider
doing something useful

03:25.972 --> 03:27.872
instead of wasting
other people's time

03:28.041 --> 03:29.167
- with a bunch of...
- Manure.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.242
I was just getting to that.

03:34.247 --> 03:35.805
You know, she's got a point,
Grandpa.

03:35.915 --> 03:38.713
Are you sure bringing Ty back here
was such a good idea?

03:39.852 --> 03:42.047
I made him a promise, Lou.

03:42.155 --> 03:45.386
I'm gonna stick to it.

03:49.495 --> 03:50.553

04:07.413 --> 04:09.142
Why'd you have to go and honk, Dad?

04:09.249 --> 04:10.876
We just about had him
in the pen.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.976
Well, I just couldn't wait
to show you what I got here.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.351
This guy's name is Storm.
He's a 6-year-old Dutch Warmblood.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.447
That's what the papers say,
anyway.

04:19.559 --> 04:22.084
- He's beautiful.
- Yeah.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.789
- Well, what's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

04:24.897 --> 04:27.491
Well, except he's a day late
for your birthday.

a big red bow around his neck?

You got me a horse
for my birthday?

I can't wait to try him over fences.

06:01.427 --> 06:02.689
I don't know. I want to, but...

06:02.795 --> 06:04.228
But you just don't want
to rush things.

06:25.451 --> 06:26.509
Just turn him out, okay?

06:30.423 --> 06:34.257
Looks like you're not the only one
who's been replaced.

06:40.166 --> 06:44.125
So, what did that guy used to do
around here?

06:44.237 --> 06:45.602
It's complicated.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.003

Oh, my God.

08:03.783 --> 08:04.579
Is that...?

08:05.451 --> 08:07.214
I just picked them up
at the post office.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.311
Oh, Dad!

08:09.422 --> 08:11.856
Thank you!

What are you doing
with that horse?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.307
Trying to take the edge off.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.436
Why don't you ride him?

08:34.547 --> 08:37.072
He's Amy's horse.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.580
Hey, easy, easy, easy.

08:39.751 --> 08:42.448
I'm betting
you're not much of a rider.

08:43.054 --> 08:45.250
Havert done much lately.

08:45.358 --> 08:49.522
And you obviously don't know
too much about horses.

08:49.629 --> 08:52.928
What brought you back here?
The fresh mountain air?

08:54.000 --> 08:55.865
Yeah, that's it.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.427
It's too bad, though.

'Cause all I'm smelling right now

Yeah, you been gone
for a while, huh?

09:11.417 --> 09:15.012

Look, here's the deal, man.

what's going on with Amy...

09:31.671 --> 09:34.299
Fair is fair.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.774

of doing that all on her own.

Well, I take it you're inviting
yourself for supper.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.516
No. Not at all.

to me staying here.

09:53.626 --> 09:57.221

I ought to know your upsides

09:57.330 --> 09:59.662
and your downsides by now.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.130
I made a promise to your folks,

10:01.233 --> 10:04.361
and I'll more than likely
be keeping it.

10:04.503 --> 10:06.061
More than likely?

10:34.166 --> 10:35.793
Nobody gives a damn.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.436
What was I thinking?

10:39.972 --> 10:42.566
You know, Jack,
Lou didn't just stay in Hudson

10:42.742 --> 10:45.176
so she could buy groceries
and wash dishes.

10:45.277 --> 10:47.211
Well, I wonder what she thinks
she'll be doing

10:47.313 --> 10:52.250
if she gets that dude ranch
up and running.

No, it's not that.

11:18.344 --> 11:19.902
Listen.

11:20.012 --> 11:21.843
There's another one out there.

11:22.748 --> 11:24.841

11:24.950 --> 11:27.248
One only you can hear.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.614
It's weird, though.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.313
What is?

11:30.423 --> 11:33.153
I mean, did you ever think
we'd see him again?

11:33.259 --> 11:35.022
You put your life on the line
to set him free.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.760
That was different.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.061
Yeah, a lot of things
are different.

11:46.605 --> 11:49.438
And whose fault is that?

11:59.618 --> 12:00.550
That's great, Lou.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.884
And each unit has its own washroom
with its own eco-toilet.

12:03.989 --> 12:04.887
Wow, awesome.

12:05.357 --> 12:06.449
Excuse me.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.083
Go ahead.

12:08.828 --> 12:10.557
JACK: Don't forget that baling twine
in town.

12:10.663 --> 12:11.789
Well, what about the mustang?

12:11.897 --> 12:13.831
You need any help getting
those antibiotics into him?

12:13.933 --> 12:17.425
Well, I figure me, Ty, and Scott,
we can handle it.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.937
Yeah, Ty's the real expert
at mustangs.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.135
Hey, Jack.
Have you seen these plans?

12:28.247 --> 12:29.509
Grandpa's not interested.

12:29.615 --> 12:31.276
Now, I never said that.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.476
Oh, really? My mistake.

12:34.386 --> 12:36.581
All right, Lou.
I'll take a look.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.189
Sorry. Not now, Grandpa.

12:38.290 --> 12:41.691
I have a very busy day
ahead of me.

12:41.794 --> 12:45.491
Okay, then.
When would be convenient?

12:45.598 --> 12:48.761
I'll have to get back to you on that.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.436
Yeah, I don't get it.

13:00.546 --> 13:02.537
Amy gets near this horse,
and he freaks out.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.607
Stallions don't like to be
bossed around by mares.

13:05.718 --> 13:08.050
Are you saying

13:08.154 --> 13:09.314
Runs in the family.

13:11.157 --> 13:14.820
I don't see any signs of infection,
but better safe than sorry.

13:14.927 --> 13:16.519
Still, you got to wonder.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.325
Each day he's handled,
he's gonna be a little less wild

13:19.431 --> 13:20.693
than he was the day before.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.429
And a lot less likely
to survive on his own.

13:24.603 --> 13:25.695
Let him go.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.644
Oh, my God. How am I
gonna remember all this?

13:32.812 --> 13:35.645
It's called studying.
You do it at home before a test.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.841
Ooh, let me guess.
Chemistry?

13:37.950 --> 13:39.815
Yeah, I failed that one
back in the day.

13:39.919 --> 13:42.046
So, tuna salad times two?

13:42.154 --> 13:43.382
I did okay with math.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.081
Then, make that three.

13:45.257 --> 13:47.885
Light dressing. Extra dressing.
Dressing on the side.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.585
- I get that right?
- Always do.

13:50.529 --> 13:51.154
I love her.

13:51.263 --> 13:53.595
Ever since she started working here,
I actually have free time.

13:53.699 --> 13:55.564
If she ever left,
my life would totally suck.

13:55.668 --> 13:59.468
So, Amy, now that Ty's back,
what's the deal with you and him?

13:59.572 --> 14:01.335
No deal.
He's just working at our place.

14:04.610 --> 14:05.736
It's so unfair.

14:07.246 --> 14:09.180
How come all the hot guys
work for you?

14:09.281 --> 14:11.977
Oh, until you hook up with them?
And then they disappear.

14:12.084 --> 14:13.915
Ben went to university.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.180
So I can hardly
call that disappearing.

14:16.288 --> 14:19.052
Hey, Amy.
Skipping school again?

14:19.158 --> 14:22.685
No. It's lunchtime, so...

14:23.596 --> 14:24.290
Oh.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.500
- You're drooling.
- I am not!

14:31.604 --> 14:35.165
He's totally droolwon'thy,
but he's not your type.

14:35.274 --> 14:39.176
And more importantly,
you're not his type.

14:39.345 --> 14:42.371
But I definitely am.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.211
Ashley.

14:45.351 --> 14:46.818
What about school?

14:46.919 --> 14:50.787
Don't wait for me.
I'll get a ride with Caleb.

15:04.870 --> 15:07.805
So, we're gonna lay
the foundations right here.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.771
Here?

15:08.874 --> 15:12.139
Yeah. Dad thought this was the...

15:12.244 --> 15:15.338
The architects really liked this site.

15:15.447 --> 15:18.507
Plus, it's exactly what you wanted.

15:18.617 --> 15:19.584
Really?

15:19.685 --> 15:20.982
It meets all of your conditions.

15:21.086 --> 15:24.487
You can't see it
from the house or the barn.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.449
What are your plans
for these bunkhouses?

15:27.559 --> 15:29.584
Oh, we're gonna tear those down.

15:30.062 --> 15:32.326
My grandfather built these
with his own hands.

15:34.366 --> 15:37.767
Grandpa, they're practically
falling down already.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.936
No one's tearing down
these bunkhouses.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.634
But I can't build my guest cabins
with those shacks in the way.

15:43.742 --> 15:46.472
Then, I guess you just
can't build them, Lou.

16:20.245 --> 16:21.177
Amy!

16:22.147 --> 16:23.774
Where'd you get that horse?

16:24.450 --> 16:26.247
My dad.
He was a birthday present.

16:26.352 --> 16:27.080
Wow!

16:27.186 --> 16:28.585
Sweet!

16:28.687 --> 16:31.019
Yeah, yeah, he's a great mover.

16:31.123 --> 16:33.182
He doesn't really respect
the jumps, though.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.351
That's because they're too low.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.023
That's Storm, isn't it?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.152
Yeah. How'd you know?

16:39.264 --> 16:41.789
I saw him at the international ring
last year.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.060
He was awesome.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.535
So all you have to do
is crank up the jumps, and that's it.

16:46.638 --> 16:47.229
CALEB: Hey!

16:48.707 --> 16:51.938
I would help you, but I...

16:52.044 --> 16:53.875
Ashley, he's working.

16:54.046 --> 16:56.207
Well, so am I.

17:00.319 --> 17:01.911
Hi, Caleb.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.113
How you doing?

17:25.077 --> 17:25.771
So...

17:37.556 --> 17:38.454
Jack.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.459
I was hoping to see your boss.
Heard he was out of the hospital.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.563
Ray? No. He's in the city.
He went to see his lawyer.

17:45.697 --> 17:48.131
He said he hasn't rewritten his will
since his wife passed away.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.961
A couple of us
could probably say the same.

17:53.472 --> 17:57.169
What, you still got something
in there for me, Jack?

17:58.544 --> 18:00.978
I see Ray's still running
those longhorns.

18:01.547 --> 18:05.108
Yeah, it's a funny thing,
Ray and those longhorns.

18:05.284 --> 18:07.149
He's got a thousand head
of whiteface,

18:07.252 --> 18:10.016
and he cares more
about those two.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.350
A pair of longhorns.

18:11.957 --> 18:13.788
It's the horns are won'th more
than the cow.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.757
Aw, it's not so much the money
with him.

18:15.861 --> 18:17.988
It's more their symbolic value.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.962
Like that horse you bought Amy.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.135
Un-un.
No, that's all about the money.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.899
I missed a lot of birthdays, Jack.

18:29.074 --> 18:31.042
And that's how
you're gonna make up for it?

18:32.044 --> 18:33.238
What about you?

18:33.412 --> 18:34.879
Why don't you look
at your attitude, huh?

18:34.980 --> 18:36.948
Why don't you ask yourself
why you're stopping Lou

18:37.049 --> 18:38.676
from tearing down those shacks?

18:38.784 --> 18:41.048
Well, maybe you want to mind
your own business.

18:41.153 --> 18:42.643
No, it's my business, Jack.

18:42.754 --> 18:45.484
It is my business.
It's my daughter.

18:45.858 --> 18:46.586
It doesn't look good,

18:46.692 --> 18:49.183
you letting your misguided sentiment
get in the way.

18:49.294 --> 18:52.627
Last time I checked,
Heartland wasrt a dude ranch.

18:52.731 --> 18:53.789
It's my ranch.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.093
So I get the final say
on what gets built

18:56.201 --> 18:57.634
and what gets torn down.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.498
You're the boss.

19:03.575 --> 19:07.011
At least you got something right.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.149
So, Jack said no?

19:12.317 --> 19:15.684
I'm not taking it as an actual "no".
More of a "maybe".

19:15.787 --> 19:16.913
I don't know, babe.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.114
Have you ever noticed
the ranchers around here

19:19.224 --> 19:21.351
never tear down their old buildings
on the spread?

19:21.460 --> 19:22.984
They just let them rot
back into the ground.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.191
Okay, so, it's gonna take
a little rethink.

19:26.298 --> 19:28.323
Did you know that the rack
of longhorns

19:28.433 --> 19:29.593
over the bunkhouse door

19:29.701 --> 19:31.692
have been there since it was
a working cattle ranch?

19:31.803 --> 19:33.134
We'll repurpose them.

19:33.238 --> 19:35.570
They would look really interesting
over one of the beds.

19:36.208 --> 19:40.406
You know,
recycle, reuse, repurpose.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.705
He's never gonna change
his mind, is he?

19:44.716 --> 19:47.480
I'm sorry for the wait.
I'm so totally stressed.

19:47.586 --> 19:48.883
What happened to Mitch?

19:48.987 --> 19:49.885
Can you believe it?

19:49.988 --> 19:52.422
She's barely been here a month,
and she's already taking a week off.

19:52.591 --> 19:54.183
And my mom's out of town.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.589
My life totally sucks.

19:56.695 --> 19:58.026
Be back in a second.

20:00.899 --> 20:02.560
What?

20:13.278 --> 20:14.540
There it is!

20:14.646 --> 20:15.738
My mechanical pencil.

20:15.847 --> 20:18.179
How am I supposed to do
my geometry homework without it?

20:18.283 --> 20:20.148
Well, I suppose you could do it
at home.

20:26.024 --> 20:27.218
Jackson?

20:27.693 --> 20:29.024
Your name is Jackson?

20:29.995 --> 20:31.428
Who calls you Jackson?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.222
Nobody.

20:32.331 --> 20:38.964
Especially nobody who expects
to spend the summer in my house.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.463
Keep the pencil.

20:41.573 --> 20:45.065
Jack... son.

20:46.178 --> 20:47.145
I called him Jackson.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.215
Not once. Not twice.
Three or four times.

20:50.315 --> 20:52.681
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!
I couldn't stop myself.

20:53.485 --> 20:56.079
Oh, my God.
That is serious.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.485
It's not funny.

20:57.656 --> 20:58.918
I plan to spend my summer here.

20:59.024 --> 21:00.787
The whole summer?

21:00.892 --> 21:03.190
Yeah, and how's that gonna work out
when Jack hates me?

21:04.062 --> 21:05.962
That'll work fine.

21:06.131 --> 21:08.156
Amy hates me,
and I'm still here.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.464
She doesn't hate you.
It's the opposite of hate.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.265
Oh, yeah?

21:13.372 --> 21:16.398
She seems pretty friendly
with that Caleb guy.

21:16.508 --> 21:17.770
What's his story?

21:17.876 --> 21:19.901
He lives in a trailer,
he has a great big truck,

21:20.012 --> 21:22.276
and his nickname is Odellicious.

21:22.381 --> 21:25.179
How much time you got?

21:27.586 --> 21:28.518
LOU: Ready?

21:30.555 --> 21:31.817
Stand back.

21:31.923 --> 21:33.322
What's the occasion, Lou?

21:34.860 --> 21:37.055
I would like to propose a toast.

21:45.103 --> 21:45.899
To the future!

21:46.972 --> 21:47.700
To the future.

21:48.173 --> 21:51.631
A future where nothing
ever changes.

21:52.110 --> 21:55.045
Where day after day, we all know
exactly what we'll be doing.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.672
Cooking meals and cleaning up
after a bunch of people

21:57.783 --> 21:59.910
whose only concern is
"What's for dinner, Lou?

22:00.018 --> 22:01.645
Did you buy any juice, Lou?"

22:02.854 --> 22:04.651
A future with a bunch of old shacks

22:04.756 --> 22:06.656
happily rotting away
in a clearing somewhere

22:06.758 --> 22:08.919
that you can't see from the house
and you can't see from the barn,

22:09.027 --> 22:11.393
but they got to be there forever
because they've always been there,

22:11.496 --> 22:17.401
and nothing but nothing
is ever gonna change that.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.401
Cheers.

22:26.545 --> 22:29.571
Sorry I asked.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.351
Have you seen Lou around?

22:40.459 --> 22:41.517
Nope.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.116
Have you seen my truck?

22:43.795 --> 22:45.353
Nope.

22:45.464 --> 22:47.625
Maybe she decided to go
for a drive.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.466
All the way back to New York.

22:50.635 --> 22:53.103
Well, I'm glad you survived
the first couple days back

22:53.205 --> 22:54.729
with your sense of humor intact.

22:56.641 --> 22:58.370
Hey, for what it's won'th,

22:58.844 --> 23:01.404
that hat I gave you
is hanging right there

23:01.580 --> 23:03.946
if you still want it.

23:08.086 --> 23:11.055
I found it in the garbage.

23:11.156 --> 23:15.889
I guess we both got
a pretty good idea who put it there.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.000
But you never asked him
why he didn't call.

23:23.101 --> 23:25.467
Because I don't care.
Why don't you ask him?

23:25.570 --> 23:26.798
I already did.

23:27.739 --> 23:28.671
What did he say?

23:28.840 --> 23:30.102
See, you do care!

23:31.410 --> 23:33.173
I was lying.
I didn't really ask him.

23:33.278 --> 23:36.270
But that doesn't change a thing.

23:39.284 --> 23:41.411
Don't get me wrong, Dad.
I love Storm.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.485
But, I mean,
what about this guy?

23:43.688 --> 23:45.883
He's a champion, too.
Arert you, boy?

23:46.024 --> 23:50.085
Well, Spartars a good horse,
but Storm's a great horse.

23:50.195 --> 23:51.662
That's the problem.

23:51.763 --> 23:56.257
I mean, it takes a lot of commitment
to show a horse at Storm's level.

23:56.368 --> 23:57.528
I don't know if I can handle it.

23:57.636 --> 23:59.831
I'm already falling behind at school
and at the ranch.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.065
Amy, Amy, I can help you.

24:02.174 --> 24:04.335
I can help you,
and we can do it together.

24:05.377 --> 24:07.368
You're talking
about professional show jumping.

24:07.479 --> 24:09.913
Yes. Professional show jumping.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.347
And you're a natural.
You could be a champ, Amy.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.850
You want to take this
to the next level,

24:13.952 --> 24:15.214
you got the horse
that can do it now.

24:15.320 --> 24:18.118
You've got a horse
that can take you all the way.

24:19.424 --> 24:24.919
And you'll see
here, here, and here,

24:25.030 --> 24:27.965
I've removed any mention
of your son-in-law Tim Fleming

24:28.066 --> 24:29.055
as a beneficiary.

24:29.234 --> 24:32.965
Ex-son-in-law.

24:33.538 --> 24:34.630
I'll borrow your pen.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.330
You fellas need a hit of java?

24:36.441 --> 24:38.671
Joe? Rocket fuel?
Black gold?

24:38.844 --> 24:41.438
How about I give you a few more
minutes to look at the menu?

24:41.546 --> 24:42.205
Lou?

24:43.515 --> 24:44.504
That's what it says.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.015
Excuse me.

24:51.590 --> 24:54.081
Lou, what are you doing?

24:54.192 --> 24:55.716
Sorry, Grandpa.
I can't talk right now.

24:55.827 --> 24:57.351
When I was in business school
getting my MBA,

24:57.462 --> 24:58.759
one of the first things
they taught us

24:58.864 --> 25:00.559
is that the customer
always comes first.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.690
Are you still working on that?

25:02.801 --> 25:04.496
Hey!

25:10.308 --> 25:12.708
[Dishes clang]

25:15.547 --> 25:16.343
Easy.

25:19.718 --> 25:20.514
Good boy.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.383
Amy, get out of there!

25:33.965 --> 25:35.933
Get out of there, Amy!

25:41.473 --> 25:42.462
Back off!

25:44.442 --> 25:46.342
Amy!

25:46.444 --> 25:48.378
You all right?

25:51.383 --> 25:52.907
Come on.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.777
One of these days,
that horse is gonna kill you.

25:59.324 --> 26:02.088
Well, breaking a horse,
it's not exactly rocket science.

26:02.193 --> 26:03.956
There are a lot
of different ways of doing it,

26:04.062 --> 26:05.962
and this here
is the tried and true.

26:06.798 --> 26:08.425
Well, have you done this before?

26:08.533 --> 26:10.000
A few times, yeah.

26:10.635 --> 26:12.068
With a mustang?

26:12.170 --> 26:13.797
No, you got to catch them first.

26:13.905 --> 26:17.102
Given you manage to rope
that mustang and get him into a pen,

26:17.208 --> 26:20.473
you tie a leg up like so.

26:22.547 --> 26:24.572
Then you just sort of get him
down to the ground.

26:24.683 --> 26:28.449
Lay down.
Lay down, lay down.

26:28.553 --> 26:32.421
Easy, brother.
Easy, easy.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.491
You're okay.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.118
Lay down.

26:38.063 --> 26:40.293
Once you've got him
on the ground,

26:40.465 --> 26:43.593
well, there's no doubt
about who's boss now.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.097
And then when you let him up.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.570
Easy, now. Easy.

26:49.674 --> 26:52.108
Easy.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.337
Well, you got yourself
a fully broke horse.

26:54.512 --> 26:57.743
Never look at you
with evil intentions ever again.

26:58.883 --> 27:03.616
Is that what you want, Amy?
A mustang for a house pet?

27:03.788 --> 27:06.188
I didn't mean to offend anybody,
but I think your friend there

27:06.291 --> 27:08.486
might not be cut out
for working with livestock.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.138
I know it seems harsh,

27:21.239 --> 27:24.902
but that's how cowboys
break horses around here.

27:25.343 --> 27:27.334
It's just one way, Ty.
It's not my way.

27:27.445 --> 27:28.537
But we got to do something.

27:28.713 --> 27:30.305
We can't just let him sit
in that pen.

27:30.415 --> 27:31.507
You're right, Amy.

27:31.616 --> 27:33.208
We can't just leave that horse
in the pen.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.786
What if he can't survive
on his own in the wild, huh?

27:35.887 --> 27:38.287
What if he gets rounded up,
sold for meat, shot?

27:38.390 --> 27:40.221
Maybe it's not for you to decide
what happens to him.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.088
Why do you have to fight me
on everything?

27:42.193 --> 27:45.185
This isn't about me or you.
Or that cowboy.

27:45.296 --> 27:47.764
It's about the horse
and what's best for him.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.797
Yeah.

27:49.901 --> 27:50.890
Yeah, exactly.

27:51.002 --> 27:54.062
What makes you think
you know what's best?

28:03.381 --> 28:05.076
Hey! Jack!

28:06.184 --> 28:07.845
How's it going?

28:07.952 --> 28:09.579
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

28:09.688 --> 28:12.054
Afraid I'm all coffee-ed out.

28:12.157 --> 28:13.590
Well, I figure
there had to be a reason

28:13.692 --> 28:16.126
you're being so pigheaded
about the dude-ranch thing.

28:16.227 --> 28:17.888
You're right.
There's a damn good reason.

28:17.996 --> 28:20.590
Yeah, and I bet it's got nothing
to do with those bunkhouses.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.758
It's probably got something
to do with me, huh?

28:22.867 --> 28:25.267
Come on,
let me buy you a coffee.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.867
Oh, I understand if you
don't want to talk about it

28:28.973 --> 28:30.304
in front of the new waitress.

28:30.942 --> 28:32.432
Oh.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.977
You know, do you?

28:34.579 --> 28:36.740
Which is why I'm willing
to take a backseat,

28:36.848 --> 28:40.079
become a silent partner,
let you and Lou work things out.

28:40.251 --> 28:42.549
Well, that solves
one of my problems right there.

28:42.654 --> 28:45.555
Good. Good.

28:45.657 --> 28:46.919
Well, I still have a problem.

28:47.025 --> 28:50.483
I used to like to go in there
and have a quiet cup of coffee.

28:50.595 --> 28:53.723
But now with Lou working there...

28:54.466 --> 28:56.934
Well.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.403
Hey.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.635
Yeah?

29:12.851 --> 29:15.877
Look, I didn't want to say anything
with Amy around.

29:15.987 --> 29:18.046
Well, you know how girls get
about horses.

29:18.156 --> 29:19.783
But that mustang.

29:19.891 --> 29:22.985
Oh, he'd sooner kill her
than look at her twice.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.254
Yeah, that's what I told her.

29:24.362 --> 29:25.829
So you understand, then?

29:25.930 --> 29:29.195
I mean, you either break a horse
to ride him or you let him go.

29:30.201 --> 29:37.437
And, well, personally speaking,
I'd be letting him go.

29:45.984 --> 29:48.646
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:48.753 --> 29:50.015
Ah, thank you.

29:50.188 --> 29:51.883
Those aren't for you.

29:53.925 --> 29:55.654
Oh!

29:55.827 --> 29:57.624
I warned you.

29:57.729 --> 30:00.220
They're day-olds for the horses.

30:00.331 --> 30:02.060
I'll bring you some fresh ones
tomorrow.

30:02.167 --> 30:04.601
You can't actually be serious
about working at Maggie's.

30:04.702 --> 30:05.691
Why not?

30:05.804 --> 30:08.432
The hospitality industry
is one of the fastest-growing sectors

30:08.540 --> 30:10.030
in today's economy.

30:10.208 --> 30:13.006
Hotels, bars, restaurants,
equine retreats,

30:13.111 --> 30:15.671
or as this family likes to call them,
dude ranches.

30:15.847 --> 30:19.214
So, yes, I am very serious.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.978
Okay, we need the money,
and I need a challenge.

30:25.089 --> 30:27.887
So, if Grandpa can't see that,
then everyone else will.

30:33.331 --> 30:36.528
Oh, my God, I smell like a BLT.
I got to take a shower.

30:39.804 --> 30:42.534
You promise you won't hate me?

30:42.640 --> 30:44.608
Why would I hate you?

30:44.709 --> 30:46.677
I read Jack's will.

30:46.778 --> 30:47.745
I had to!

30:47.846 --> 30:51.577
It was just sitting there.
Almost out in the open.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.411
So, are you in it?

30:53.518 --> 30:57.682
No. But don't get too excited.
You aren't either.

30:57.789 --> 31:00.314
Let me guess.
It's all Lou and Amy.

31:00.425 --> 31:01.858
Yeah, that's what I don't get.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.484
Lou's gonna get
her dude ranch anyway,

31:03.595 --> 31:05.495
so why doesn't he just
give it to her now?

31:05.597 --> 31:07.326
Maybe he likes the way things are.

31:07.432 --> 31:09.332
Or the way they used to be.

31:09.500 --> 31:12.162
You mean, he's stuck in the past?
Oh, my God.

31:12.270 --> 31:14.670
- Should I talk to him about that?
- Yeah, right.

31:14.839 --> 31:16.773
Tell him you read his will
and you have some suggestions.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.433
Would that be before
or after you ask him

31:18.543 --> 31:22.604
if he's still good with you
moving in for the summer?

31:29.754 --> 31:30.721
There it is again.

31:30.822 --> 31:32.915
[Horse whinnies off in the distance]

31:33.024 --> 31:34.787
You really think he has a mate?

31:34.893 --> 31:36.383
Yeah. Listen.

31:37.195 --> 31:40.892
[Horse whinnies off in the distance]

31:41.065 --> 31:43.533
Wow. Sounds really Ionely.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.626
[Horse whinnies off in the distance]

31:49.407 --> 31:52.934
You know, you and Amy,

31:53.044 --> 31:56.810
I really think
you should get back together.

31:57.448 --> 32:00.508
It's not that simple, Mallory.

32:01.619 --> 32:03.587
It never is.

32:04.389 --> 32:07.153
[Horse whinnies off in the distance]

32:08.426 --> 32:09.552
[Horse grunts]

32:20.738 --> 32:25.437
I see you finally made a decision
about that mustang.

32:25.543 --> 32:29.411
What?
What are you talking about?

32:29.948 --> 32:32.075
These are good.

32:35.019 --> 32:36.543
Ty!

32:36.654 --> 32:38.178
Ty!

32:39.557 --> 32:41.320
Ty, quick!

32:41.426 --> 32:43.986
It's Ghost.

32:45.063 --> 32:47.554
Ty, come on, we have to find him!
He's gone!

32:48.132 --> 32:49.861
I'm not gonna help you find him.

32:50.902 --> 32:52.096
Why not?

32:52.270 --> 32:53.965
I let him go.

32:55.206 --> 32:57.197
You what?

32:57.308 --> 32:58.673
I set him free.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.111
Who do you think you are?

33:01.212 --> 33:02.702
You don't even care
about that horse!

33:02.880 --> 33:05.178
I care about you, Amy,
and I don't want to see you hurt.

33:05.283 --> 33:06.409
Hey, Amy.

33:06.517 --> 33:09.975
I'll help you find that mustang.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.464
I'm betting he's most likely
headed up the river valley

33:20.565 --> 33:21.554
towards the mountains.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.223
If some rancher puts a bullet
in his head,

33:23.334 --> 33:26.030
I am never gonna forgive you.

33:35.146 --> 33:36.078
Hey.

33:37.148 --> 33:40.242
You know, Lou, I thought it was tough
getting time with you before,

33:40.351 --> 33:41.875
but this is ridiculous.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.513
How about romantic?

33:44.622 --> 33:47.887
Tall, dark stranger.
Hot waitress.

33:48.059 --> 33:49.856
I've got sensible shoes.

33:50.028 --> 33:53.088
I have a little apron,
a name tag.

33:53.931 --> 33:56.365
So, tell me about your specials.

33:58.269 --> 34:03.400
Well, the veal scallopini
is very tasty.

34:03.574 --> 34:04.563
Sounds good.

34:04.709 --> 34:09.373
But a lot of the regulars are going
for the chicken pot pie.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.775
I'll take them both.

34:10.947 --> 34:13.576
Finished off with a hot-fudge sundae?

34:17.155 --> 34:20.147
You got to stop working here, Lou.
You're driving me crazy.

34:20.257 --> 34:22.283
Well, I got to do something.

34:22.393 --> 34:25.190
That equine retreat
means a lot to me.

34:25.295 --> 34:29.255
So, until I can come up
with another plan...

34:31.335 --> 34:33.326
Well, if this keeps up,

34:33.438 --> 34:36.100
I'm gonna have to trade my truck in
for a double wide.

34:39.877 --> 34:42.344
I got to admit, I was
pretty impressed back there.

34:42.447 --> 34:44.244
That's some temper you got.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.713
You and Ty, I'm betting
there's a lot of history there.

34:46.818 --> 34:50.310
Yeah, history.
That's a good way of putting it.

35:01.866 --> 35:04.198
You seen Caleb around?

35:04.302 --> 35:06.998
He took off with Amy.
They went after the mustang.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.094
Mustang?

35:08.306 --> 35:11.400
Last I saw, he was in the pen.
He can't jump that fence.

35:11.509 --> 35:14.910
He didn't jump it.
I left the gate open.

35:15.012 --> 35:19.472
Well, that was
a damn stupid thing to do!

35:19.617 --> 35:20.606
Why?

35:20.751 --> 35:22.378
When you truck a horse
like that out of here,

35:22.487 --> 35:24.853
he's got a good chance
of making it somewhere.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.356
You just let him loose,
he's got to cover a lot of miles,

35:27.458 --> 35:29.085
get past a lot of cattle ranchers,

35:29.260 --> 35:31.194
and plenty of them would
just as soon shoot a stray

35:31.295 --> 35:32.262
as keep him moving.

35:32.930 --> 35:34.795
Okay. Maybe it was stupid.

35:34.899 --> 35:36.491
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.

35:36.667 --> 35:41.001
Yeah, well,
the stupid ones always do.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.742
Okay, I think we should split up.

35:45.843 --> 35:48.175
I'll go along the ridge,
and you stay along this way.

35:48.279 --> 35:49.507
Well, there's not much point.

35:49.614 --> 35:51.343
What? You want to give up
just like that?

35:51.449 --> 35:53.440
We don't know where he is.
He could be anywhere.

35:53.551 --> 35:54.518
No, all I'm saying is

35:54.619 --> 35:57.144
unless that horse
can cross rivers or jump fences,

35:57.255 --> 36:00.520
there's only one way for him
to get back up there.

36:00.625 --> 36:02.889
Okay. We'll go this way.

36:27.485 --> 36:28.884
Look! Over there.

36:28.986 --> 36:30.749
Just down by the trees.

36:35.226 --> 36:36.625
Ty was right!

36:36.727 --> 36:38.194
He's with another horse! A mare!

36:43.234 --> 36:44.428
[Gunshot]

36:45.636 --> 36:47.831
- Someone's shooting!
- They're just over there.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.404
[Gunshot]

36:50.341 --> 36:51.569
They're gonna kill them!

36:51.676 --> 36:52.438
[Gunshot]

36:53.644 --> 36:55.009
Amy! Amy! No!

37:03.721 --> 37:05.382
[Gunshot]

37:07.124 --> 37:08.716
[Gunshot]

37:11.929 --> 37:13.897
[Gunshot]

37:15.533 --> 37:17.262
[Gunshot]

37:25.476 --> 37:26.408
[Gunshot]

37:26.510 --> 37:29.240
No, stop! Stop!

37:36.354 --> 37:38.185
Grandpa?

37:46.030 --> 37:49.090
We're not shooting to kill him, Amy,
but someone else most likely will.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.963
We're just hoping
to keep him moving.

37:51.068 --> 37:52.126
We could still catch that horse.

37:52.236 --> 37:53.828
You could help
instead of chasing him away!

37:56.340 --> 38:01.403
Ty, why don't you take that
in the truck?

38:02.847 --> 38:04.280
What are you doing, Grandpa?

38:05.016 --> 38:09.476
Listen, Amy, I know
you've got this thing with Ty

38:09.587 --> 38:10.986
and that mustang all mixed up.

38:11.155 --> 38:12.816
What are you talking about?

38:12.923 --> 38:15.323
You try to hold on
to something like that horse

38:15.426 --> 38:17.223
and you end up
squeezing the life out of it.

38:17.328 --> 38:18.886
So, you got to let go.

38:19.063 --> 38:20.087
And until you do,

38:20.197 --> 38:22.722
you're not doing yourself
or anyone any favors.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.097
Grandpa.

38:24.201 --> 38:25.862
You go on home now.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.598
Me and Ty, we'll keep pushing
those horses a few more miles

38:28.706 --> 38:32.665
till they're good and safe
up in the mountains.

38:33.477 --> 38:34.409
Let's go.

39:08.379 --> 39:10.813
[Sighs]

39:25.730 --> 39:27.163
Um...

39:27.264 --> 39:31.030
I was just wondering.
Did you see Ghost again?

39:31.135 --> 39:32.864
Yeah, a couple of times.

39:32.970 --> 39:34.938
Him and that other one.

39:35.106 --> 39:38.200
Yeah, it was a mare.

39:38.309 --> 39:41.369
You were right.

39:41.746 --> 39:45.341
So, how far did you get?

39:45.449 --> 39:49.146
All the way past the logging road
until we couldn't go any further.

39:49.253 --> 39:50.914
That's good.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.549
Yeah.

40:00.464 --> 40:04.992
Someone's been doing
a little Dumpster diving.

40:07.938 --> 40:10.702
Okay, maybe I was wrong
about that horse.

40:10.808 --> 40:12.833
But that still doesn't mean
what you did was right.

40:13.010 --> 40:14.807
You mean letting him go?

40:16.213 --> 40:18.044
Sort of.

40:22.153 --> 40:26.214
I just don't know why you didn't even
try to call me or anything!

40:26.323 --> 40:28.848
Amy, I don't know.

40:29.760 --> 40:33.594
I wanted to. I just...
I didn't know what to say.

40:35.132 --> 40:39.159
Amy, I just...

40:39.270 --> 40:42.296
Here, you're gonna need this
if you're staying.

40:50.147 --> 40:52.081
Bring him around.

40:52.183 --> 40:54.014
Thatagirl.

40:55.986 --> 40:58.045
That's it. That's it. You got it!

40:59.723 --> 41:01.884
Amazing! He's incredible!

41:01.992 --> 41:03.926
He just jumped that
like it was nothing.

41:04.061 --> 41:05.494
[Laughs]

41:07.398 --> 41:09.628
TIM: So, you think you can win
a few ribbons with that horse?

41:09.733 --> 41:10.290
AMY: Maybe.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.595
TIM: What do you say?
Go one more time?

41:12.703 --> 41:13.567
AMY: Okay, yeah.

41:38.362 --> 41:40.421
Watch it!

41:40.598 --> 41:42.964
Hey, Lou, perfect timing.

41:43.067 --> 41:44.432
Have you got a minute?

41:44.535 --> 41:45.866
Not now, Grandpa.

41:45.970 --> 41:51.101
Well, it's about your equestrian
restrooms, haven, cure thing.

41:51.208 --> 41:52.402
Dude ranch, Grandpa.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.273
Let's just call
a spade a spade, okay?

41:54.378 --> 41:56.369
Okay, then, dude ranch.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.812
It's gonna take us awhile.

41:58.916 --> 42:00.247
You want me to clear it
with Maggie?

42:00.351 --> 42:01.875
I'm sure she wouldn't mind
you slipping out.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.886
Yeah, I'm sure she won't either,
probably, Grandpa,

42:03.988 --> 42:07.116
because she just fired me, so...

42:07.291 --> 42:09.191
Oh.

42:09.293 --> 42:11.158
She said I was underqualified.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.093
[Laughs]

42:16.967 --> 42:18.559
He looks ready to go.

42:18.669 --> 42:21.604
Yeah, but the only problem
is the jumps.

42:21.705 --> 42:23.104
You want me to put them
down a notch.

42:23.207 --> 42:26.108
No, the opposite.
Let's go for it.

42:27.678 --> 42:30.078
Yeah, that's good.

42:31.181 --> 42:33.115
Just one.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.617

these bunkhouses.

I've heard.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.381
So no one's tearing them down.

43:08.485 --> 43:11.750
You brought me all the way out here
just to tell me that again?

43:11.855 --> 43:17.088
Well, thing is, Lou,
they're solid as a rock.

43:20.364 --> 43:21.422
I get it, Grandpa.

43:21.999 --> 43:24.490
We're not tearing down
your damn bunkhouses!

43:24.668 --> 43:28.934
That's right,
because we're fixing them up.

43:29.473 --> 43:34.001
New roofs, new windows,
new porches.

43:35.045 --> 43:38.242
What about my eco-toilets?

43:38.349 --> 43:43.048
Could put in an outhouse
over behind that tree line there.

43:43.153 --> 43:44.882
An outhouse!
