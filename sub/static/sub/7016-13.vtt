WEBVTT

00:07.867 --> 00:08.750
Wow.

00:09.005 --> 00:11.197
I didn't think I was gonna like Kramer vs. Kramer,

00:11.612 --> 00:13.333
but that's back when I thought we were gonna watch it.

00:14.818 --> 00:17.661
Yeah, for a PG movie there's a lot of sexual content.

00:19.091 --> 00:21.519
You know, I have noticed something about you.

00:21.752 --> 00:25.000
You only like to make out in secret, dark places.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.204
What are you talking about?

00:28.398 --> 00:32.000
Yesterday you drove me half a mile into the woods.

00:32.767 --> 00:34.668
I've never dated an Italian girl.

00:35.695 --> 00:37.700
I thought I was gonna get whacked!

00:38.260 --> 00:39.356
Well it's just...

00:40.091 --> 00:43.255
okay I'm a little nervous about telling my friends about us.

00:43.643 --> 00:46.543
Come on. What's the worst thing that could happen if we told them?

00:46.846 --> 00:48.690
Okay, let me put it this way.

00:48.691 --> 00:52.800
Two years ago I walked into the basement and my jeans had a hole in the butt.

00:52.881 --> 00:55.250
To this day they call me Poopchute Sally.

00:59.110 --> 01:00.750
Poopchute Sally?

01:02.369 --> 01:05.250
Okay let's go, I don't want to run into anyone after the movie.

01:12.761 --> 01:14.200
Oeh...busted!

01:15.604 --> 01:16.561
Wow!

01:17.074 --> 01:18.406
Unbelievable.

01:20.127 --> 01:21.264
After all that,

01:21.459 --> 01:24.250
she gives the kid back to Dustin Hoffman? That bitch is crazy!

01:27.005 --> 01:30.002

02:07.139 --> 02:09.858
I can't get over Donna and Randy making out like that.

02:10.051 --> 02:12.453
It was all broad shoulders and blond hair,

02:12.467 --> 02:14.534
I could barely tell which one was the boy.

02:16.585 --> 02:18.900
They should save that passion for her bedroom.

02:19.568 --> 02:20.900
Where I have a better view.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.757
I thought it was like watching Donna make out with Forman.

02:25.227 --> 02:28.900
Except Randy wasn't constantly saying: I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

02:31.346 --> 02:34.717
Well, we're off to buy curtains for Eric's room.

02:34.895 --> 02:36.713
We're making it into a sewing area,

02:36.741 --> 02:39.738
so I thought a nice floral print might really pretty it up.

02:39.890 --> 02:42.665
It's all part of our plan to make Eric's room less girlie.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.926
I wanted to make my room more manly

02:45.979 --> 02:48.250
so I put up some posters of the Village People.

02:51.751 --> 02:53.500
Mission accomplished.

02:55.330 --> 02:59.632
Oh oh oh well, I want to get to the fabric store before Mary's quilting club shows up.

02:59.643 --> 03:02.150
Those fat cows think they own the remnant box.

03:04.263 --> 03:05.220
Oh crap.

03:05.290 --> 03:08.939
I stashed something real important, real illegal up in Forman's room.

03:09.076 --> 03:10.283
Where'd you hide it?

03:10.463 --> 03:11.500
I don't know.

03:13.086 --> 03:15.195
I was under the influence of it when I hid it.

03:16.735 --> 03:19.815
Oooooh, hey, it's Donna and Randy.

03:19.923 --> 03:22.421
Where have you guys been....Donna & Randy?

03:24.530 --> 03:26.750
Oh. Well I was at the park.

03:27.345 --> 03:29.800
Where I was practicing my violin.

03:34.977 --> 03:36.669
For a family of ducks.

03:39.514 --> 03:40.850
I was at home.

03:41.356 --> 03:42.800
Huh. That's simple.

03:45.019 --> 03:48.654
Really? Cause you know, we went to see Kramer vs. Kramer,

03:48.682 --> 03:51.900
but instead we saw Randy's hand versus Donna's bra strap...

03:53.743 --> 03:58.200
I believe it was directed by Francis Ford Cop-A-Feel.

03:59.973 --> 04:03.012
Donna! Why didn't you just tell us you were going out with Randy?

04:03.204 --> 04:06.215
I don't know, it was just you know, you guys are friends with Eric and

04:06.229 --> 04:07.450
I didn't know what you'd think.

04:07.505 --> 04:08.726
I'm happy for you.

04:08.781 --> 04:09.807
Yeah man, whatever.

04:10.043 --> 04:11.361
Yeah I think it's great.

04:11.500 --> 04:15.250
I mean you finally found a guy that is stronger then you and that's hard to do.

04:16.384 --> 04:17.493
Okay, great!

04:17.494 --> 04:20.200
Cool, now we can all hang out and it won't be awkward.

04:28.875 --> 04:29.915
You know,

04:30.096 --> 04:33.700
it is this kind of awkwardness reminds me of the time when Dad brought this chick home.

04:34.258 --> 04:36.350
In the morning and she turned out to be a guy.

04:39.119 --> 04:41.547
Although Tony did make me a kick-ass Denver Almond.

04:42.380 --> 04:45.502
Well, I have a question of a theme that'll make things less awkward.

04:46.249 --> 04:50.065
Randy, when you kiss Donna, is it smooth like melted fudge?

04:51.882 --> 04:54.400
Or...rough like a cock fight?

04:56.655 --> 04:57.700
Fez!

04:58.096 --> 05:00.250
Now that is personal!

05:01.661 --> 05:02.993
So have you guys had sex yet?

05:03.007 --> 05:03.800
Jackie!

05:05.713 --> 05:06.837
My money is on no.

05:07.169 --> 05:09.208
Donna is a strong independent woman,

05:09.791 --> 05:12.649
who feels that men should respect women for their minds.

05:13.119 --> 05:15.464
In other words, she's a big fat tease.

05:17.157 --> 05:18.711
Well I think it is going to happen soon.

05:18.780 --> 05:21.999
Because normally Donna only shaves her legs up to her knees.

05:25.646 --> 05:29.500
But this morning, she went all the way from Miami to Jacksonville.

05:35.628 --> 05:39.429
Oh Fez, thank you so much for getting me a job as a hair consultant.

05:39.485 --> 05:42.371
Well I told my boss that you were reliable and hard-working.

05:43.481 --> 05:46.500
Awww...you lied for me!

05:47.924 --> 05:48.923
Hey there Fez.

05:49.478 --> 05:50.400
Hillary.

05:50.408 --> 05:52.489
I saved you a bite of my cinnamon muffin…

05:52.724 --> 05:53.945
Oh what a coincidence.

05:54.070 --> 05:56.700
I saved you a bite of my cinnamon bun!

05:59.786 --> 06:02.533
Ahhh I would do anything to go out with that hot little number.

06:03.199 --> 06:04.961
Well have you asked her out yet?

06:05.222 --> 06:07.609
Well I found that if a man creates mystery,

06:07.720 --> 06:09.177
the woman will come to him.

06:09.260 --> 06:10.217
So you’re scared?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.400
Terrified.

06:13.103 --> 06:14.574
But I think it is time for you to get to work.

06:14.947 --> 06:15.947
Okay.

06:16.556 --> 06:21.176
Wow. Sooo, okay, the first thing we’re gonna do is ... uhm ...

06:21.177 --> 06:25.102
get rid of these curls cause they kinda make you look like a poodle…

06:26.877 --> 06:29.014
What the hell are you doing?

06:30.719 --> 06:32.426
You are not supposed to talk to the customers!

06:32.495 --> 06:34.923
Wha…I’m the hair consultant!

06:35.103 --> 06:37.961
Why I said that to get you down here. The truth is,

06:41.416 --> 06:43.250
you’re our sweep-up girl.

06:43.634 --> 06:49.281
What? No, no no no, that’s the pathetic foreign girl with the wandering eye who sweeps up the hair.

06:50.722 --> 06:52.800
No. She’s your boss.

07:01.294 --> 07:04.056
Hm. I’ve always been curious about something….

07:08.354 --> 07:09.700
Heavens!

07:11.226 --> 07:15.763
Oh, hey. Didn’t know you guys were starting this early.

07:16.358 --> 07:18.023
It’s two in the afternoon!

07:19.272 --> 07:22.700
Yeah that damn school bus bringing home those kids woke me up again.

07:24.197 --> 07:27.541
So uhh you guys find anything interesting?

07:27.652 --> 07:32.827
Oh well, I did find this Good Housekeeping under Eric’s bed

07:32.962 --> 07:37.900
and apparently he was very interested in self-breast exams.

07:41.384 --> 07:45.900
Yeah. Mrs. Forman, I think the only thing he was interested in was examining himself.

07:47.223 --> 07:51.857
Oh well Steven, that is a perfectly normal biological function.

07:52.482 --> 07:54.900
And my baby never did that!

07:58.348 --> 07:59.583
Hey Red, you need some help?

07:59.666 --> 08:03.579
Nah nah, I’m just boxing up some of Eric’s awards.

08:04.467 --> 08:07.769
Ah it was a proud day when he came home with this beauty.

08:08.406 --> 08:09.655
Cub Scout Fair.

08:10.126 --> 08:12.800
Prettiest Non-Functioning Kite.

08:18.714 --> 08:21.572
Uhm Mrs. Forman, my Dad said you had something for me?

08:21.683 --> 08:22.918
Oh yes honey.

08:23.650 --> 08:27.161
I found some things I thought you might wanna hold on to.

08:27.535 --> 08:29.949
These are gifts and notes that you gave to Eric

08:29.950 --> 08:33.556
and it’s not like I read any of them but you have some potty-mouth…

08:35.361 --> 08:37.011
Mrs. Forman, like…

08:37.828 --> 08:39.938
seriously, Eric and I are through.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.351
Oh honey I know you think that now

08:42.352 --> 08:44.224
but he’ll be back soon and you’ll...

08:44.349 --> 08:48.081
you'll have one of those talks on the hood of the car, yes I watch!

08:49.481 --> 08:50.993
But you’ll be right back together.

08:50.994 --> 08:52.146
No we won’t.

08:52.839 --> 08:54.809
I’m..I’m moving on.

08:55.544 --> 08:59.275
And it’s not easy, cause I mean everywhere I look something reminds me of Eric.

08:59.509 --> 09:02.799
I’m sure this area in particular brings back a lot of memories…

09:09.236 --> 09:10.762
You went out again last night?

09:11.039 --> 09:11.801
Yup.

09:12.175 --> 09:15.714
I left a club with a creamy white girl and a chocolaty black girl.

09:18.072 --> 09:20.473
We went home and made hot fudge sundae.

09:22.690 --> 09:23.934
And then we did it.

09:27.255 --> 09:30.585
Uh Fez, why are you lying to her?

09:31.292 --> 09:33.301
But you didn’t go out last night!

09:33.302 --> 09:37.161
You were lying in front of the TV trying to look up Victoria Principal’s dress.

09:39.837 --> 09:42.168
Don’t you have some hair to sweep, sweep up-girl?

09:42.666 --> 09:45.612
Huh no. The place is clean!

09:55.470 --> 09:58.370
Don’t worry, that’s how the kids are wearing it nowadays.

10:11.827 --> 10:13.300
<i>Happy birthday Eric!</i>

10:13.659 --> 10:16.670
<i>I have a sexy surprise for you...</i>

10:17.263 --> 10:19.195
<i>look across into my window.</i>

10:19.968 --> 10:21.893
<i>Yeah, I thought you liked those.</i>

10:22.507 --> 10:24.366
<i>Now come over here, and I'll....</i>

10:24.380 --> 10:24.888
Hey!

10:25.365 --> 10:25.869
Hey!

10:26.029 --> 10:26.765
What's up?

10:27.986 --> 10:30.261
Nothing, just you know. Hanging out.

10:30.509 --> 10:31.250
Cool.

10:32.230 --> 10:34.825
Never sat on a hood of a car with a girl before.

10:35.005 --> 10:37.461
Yeah, actually you know what, this car was kind of...

10:37.544 --> 10:39.084
Ohhh light saber!

10:39.139 --> 10:41.165
Yeah that belonged to someone...

10:41.387 --> 10:42.330
Check it out!

10:47.851 --> 10:51.082
I'm Luke Skywalker, I'm here to rescue you!

10:55.495 --> 10:56.480
Stop it !

10:59.267 --> 11:00.208
What the hell?!

11:00.544 --> 11:01.554
I'm sorry!

11:01.680 --> 11:04.372
I'm sorry. This is, this is just too weird.

11:04.885 --> 11:07.604
I can't do this! I can't see you anymore!

11:10.282 --> 11:12.460
You could've just said you didn't like Star Wars!

11:18.189 --> 11:21.186
Mrs. Forman, you wouldn't believe the lies Fez tells this girl at work.

11:21.545 --> 11:24.138
I mean he is pretending to be someone else completely.

11:24.139 --> 11:27.418
So what, you pretend to be someone else every time you put on make-up.

11:28.329 --> 11:31.217
I have seen you in the morning, your face looks like scrambled eggs.

11:33.032 --> 11:35.460
Well we all do a little pretending.

11:36.028 --> 11:41.044
Sometimes when I'm bringing in the groceries, I pretend to be Scarlett O'Hara.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.532
And I look at all the brown bags and I say :

11:44.629 --> 11:49.387
As God is my witness, I'll never go hungry again!

11:53.202 --> 11:55.939
Oh oh, and sometimes with Red I.....

12:00.513 --> 12:03.868
Okay well the point is it's okay to pretend.

12:04.798 --> 12:10.140
Look ... I like Hillary and I was afraid that if she knew the real Fez that she wouldn't like me so...

12:10.653 --> 12:12.401
I created a new Fez.

12:12.844 --> 12:13.941
A better Fez.

12:15.064 --> 12:17.590
I call this Fez: Work-Fez.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.113
You should see me down there...

12:26.495 --> 12:28.937
Okay, let's do this!

12:38.133 --> 12:42.684
Whoooo is your man, that would risk his neck for his brother man?

12:43.142 --> 12:44.029
Fez!

12:44.321 --> 12:45.972
You're damn right!

12:46.138 --> 12:50.827
Who's the cat that won't cop out, when there's danger all about?

12:50.937 --> 12:51.784
Fez!

12:52.477 --> 12:53.448
Right on!

12:54.073 --> 12:57.527
Yo, they say this cat Fez is a bad mother.

12:57.528 --> 12:58.456
Shut your mouth!

12:58.457 --> 12:59.872
I'm talking about Fez!

13:00.009 --> 13:01.674
Then we can dig it!

13:01.730 --> 13:07.112
He's a complicated man and no-one understands him but his woman.

13:07.195 --> 13:08.999
Work-Fez!

13:19.875 --> 13:24.509
I wondered why the last time I came in you said my hair look blackalicious!

13:26.866 --> 13:29.128
Hyde, I hope I did the right thing with Randy.

13:30.222 --> 13:32.886
I just feel weird, starting up a new relationship.

13:33.289 --> 13:36.271
Yeah well you know, it's though when you've been with someone for a long time.

13:36.507 --> 13:40.100
Like, just the other day, I heard this burglar alarm,

13:40.168 --> 13:42.541
and it was making this really awful high-pitched squealing noise.

13:42.999 --> 13:44.857
I found myself thinking about Jackie.

13:48.492 --> 13:51.988
Well, you know I think I might have hurt Randy's feelings.

13:53.014 --> 13:53.597
Hi Donna.

13:53.625 --> 13:54.041
Hey.

13:54.707 --> 13:56.982
Randy is helping me build Kitty's sewing table.

13:57.190 --> 14:02.307
We're gonna make it real nice so she feels obliged to spend hours up here.

14:03.558 --> 14:07.817
Hey Steven, how ‘bout taking a ride with me down to the lumberyard before they close?

14:08.649 --> 14:09.314
No, I’m good.

14:09.328 --> 14:10.367
Nah, you’re coming.

14:12.491 --> 14:14.503
See I know that you hid dope up here.

14:15.084 --> 14:16.985
And if you found it while I was gone,

14:17.152 --> 14:20.986
I’d miss that pathetic look on your face when I flush it down the toilet.

14:22.742 --> 14:24.323
You’re a messed up dude.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.307
Yeah. Come on!

14:29.123 --> 14:32.813
So uhm…Randy I just wanna make sure that

14:33.118 --> 14:35.088
you know, I hope we can still be friends.

14:35.629 --> 14:36.919
Yeah. I’m cool with that.

14:37.197 --> 14:40.136
Well aren’t you just Beaver freakin’ Cleaver!?

14:41.040 --> 14:42.191
You want me to be a jerk?

14:42.247 --> 14:45.098
Well it would make breaking up with you a lot easier.

14:46.172 --> 14:48.281
Donna. I’m sorry, I don’t want this to be hard for you.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.232
There you go again.

14:49.238 --> 14:51.583
Fine. I won’t say another word!

14:51.942 --> 14:54.884
Oh, now you’re gonna show me the muscles?!

14:55.244 --> 14:58.560
I’m Randy, I got big muscles! I’m good looking!

15:00.405 --> 15:01.711
You're an ass!

15:06.606 --> 15:10.546
So, when are you and I gonna go out and put the fever back in Saturday night?

15:12.085 --> 15:14.028
Or Thursday, whenever you’re free…

15:15.261 --> 15:17.453
I don’t think I could keep up with you.

15:17.593 --> 15:19.951
Ohohohohhh… I think you’ll be fine.

15:23.031 --> 15:24.224
How do you know?

15:24.723 --> 15:25.985
Have you guys gone out?

15:25.999 --> 15:27.317
Oh God no.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.342
No, we’re just roommates.

15:29.592 --> 15:33.504
Wait, Fez, you told me you had your own place?

15:33.767 --> 15:36.056
You called it the Feznasium.

15:37.915 --> 15:39.440
Of…of course I do!

15:39.593 --> 15:43.466
I found this poor thing wandering around the street so I’m letting her stay on pad.

15:43.478 --> 15:46.118
Yes. I am teaching her the ways of love.

15:47.972 --> 15:50.151
Okay, that’s it. Hillary, you know what,

15:50.164 --> 15:53.146
everything that Fez has told you is a lie.

15:53.465 --> 15:56.157
He doesn’t go out, he’s in bed by nine!

15:56.184 --> 15:59.597
And his idea of a threesome is Neapolitan ice-cream.

16:01.067 --> 16:04.063
Look ... Look, I don’t know what she is talking about,

16:04.119 --> 16:06.769
this what happens when you hire a girl right off the boat!

16:08.405 --> 16:09.210
Oh really?!

16:09.335 --> 16:12.359
Okay, here, take a look inside his backpack.

16:12.387 --> 16:13.497
That’s my backpack!

16:14.884 --> 16:18.991
“When the phone never rings, a beginners guide to self-love”?

16:21.140 --> 16:22.749
Anybody lose a backpack?

16:27.508 --> 16:28.645
Hey Donna.

16:29.463 --> 16:31.252
Come here and take a look at this sewing table.

16:31.571 --> 16:33.680
It even got a cup-holder, like Kitty asked.

16:35.428 --> 16:39.035
Now that Randy is a pretty sure-up kid, he build this thing in two days.

16:40.061 --> 16:44.486
The only thing Eric ever made was this crappy bird house.

16:47.386 --> 16:48.454
Oh yeah!

16:49.425 --> 16:52.866
He was always too afraid to use the drill so he just painted the hole on there.

16:55.404 --> 16:59.705
Yeah, and one by one, an entire family of bluebirds flew to their deaths…

17:03.366 --> 17:04.324
Mr. Forman,

17:05.848 --> 17:08.998
what would you think if I…hypothetically…

17:09.692 --> 17:12.938
possibly…maybe…started dating a new guy?

17:14.894 --> 17:17.904
I’d say I think you can do whatever the hell you want.

17:19.056 --> 17:21.012
My dumb-ass son broke up with you.

17:22.940 --> 17:24.368
You are gonna have your own life.

17:25.284 --> 17:28.863
I have absolutely no problem with you dating Randy.

17:29.709 --> 17:31.124
W…you know about that?

17:31.485 --> 17:32.443
Oh come on.

17:32.914 --> 17:35.911
You’re eyes nearly popped out of your head when you saw him in that tool belt.

17:40.710 --> 17:41.542
Okay cool.

17:41.556 --> 17:44.317
It really means a lot to me that you guys are okay with this.

17:44.386 --> 17:46.536
No no no wait no, I’m okay.

17:47.021 --> 17:49.130
For the love of God, don’t tell Kitty.

17:51.322 --> 17:53.365
I’d have to make her a bigger cup holder!

17:59.479 --> 18:00.603
Thanks a lot Jackie.

18:00.714 --> 18:03.474
Now Hillary thinks I’m a crazy self-loving pervert.

18:05.069 --> 18:07.428
Well, she was gonna think that eventually!

18:11.146 --> 18:13.920
Fez, I’m confused.

18:14.058 --> 18:15.779
Why have you been lying to me?

18:16.028 --> 18:20.371
Well I wanted you to think I was cool, so you’d go out with me, but now you hate me.

18:21.993 --> 18:23.977
Actually, I don’t.

18:24.559 --> 18:27.139
Before, I was always so intimidated, but

18:27.583 --> 18:29.983
now that I know you’re just a regular guy,

18:30.122 --> 18:31.676
I’d totally go out with you!

18:33.077 --> 18:34.700
Even after you saw my...

18:36.933 --> 18:37.599
book?

18:39.527 --> 18:40.776
You’re lonely.

18:41.178 --> 18:43.051
I think it’s cute and endearing.

18:43.258 --> 18:46.851
Uhm I think you mean gross and appalling?

18:48.822 --> 18:51.499
Jackie, he’s a lost soul!

18:52.178 --> 18:54.037
Someone has to take care of him.

18:55.854 --> 18:56.604
Yes.

18:59.864 --> 19:00.960
I’m broken.

19:03.859 --> 19:04.858
Fix me.

19:11.641 --> 19:12.585
Perfect.

19:13.001 --> 19:14.832
It's just like my grandpa used to say:

19:14.874 --> 19:17.537
you measure it twice, everything’s nice.

19:18.355 --> 19:22.225
Actually, in his later years, it was all he said.

19:26.706 --> 19:29.342
Hey Red, can you hand me that box of drawer handles?

19:31.145 --> 19:33.045
What’s this?

19:33.337 --> 19:35.529
Oh ! That’s mine ! Oh….crap.

19:36.791 --> 19:38.748
A macramé owl?!

19:40.480 --> 19:42.672
What the hell kinda pansy-ass thing is this?!

19:44.254 --> 19:45.392
I do macramé.

19:48.167 --> 19:49.304
It’s my therapy.

19:50.913 --> 19:54.076
Well I didn’t realize you were so stressed out…

19:54.797 --> 19:56.656
But I think you’ll feel a lot better...

19:56.933 --> 19:58.612
once you get the sex-change.

20:04.424 --> 20:05.534
There's my therapy!

20:07.920 --> 20:08.600
Hey.

20:09.598 --> 20:10.680
Found your stash?

20:10.791 --> 20:11.415
Yep.

20:11.915 --> 20:14.065
Now I'm gonna punish it for hiding on me.

20:15.161 --> 20:16.049
By burning it.

20:18.615 --> 20:20.335
Okay look, I've been thinking about this

20:20.336 --> 20:24.240
and before on the car, I think I might have over-reacted.

20:25.398 --> 20:28.714
It's just that I was in a relationship for a really long time.

20:29.408 --> 20:32.099
And it's gonna take me a while to get used to something new.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.639
Donna, I get it.

20:34.471 --> 20:35.179
Okay.

20:36.038 --> 20:38.993
Great. So let's just you know, take it slow and see where it goes.

20:39.410 --> 20:41.629
I'm cool with that ... Poopchute-Sally.

20:43.182 --> 20:44.375
Shut up...

20:49.078 --> 20:51.603
Oh my god!

20:53.864 --> 20:56.403
In Eric's bedroom?

20:57.263 --> 20:59.705
You two-timing whore!

21:06.570 --> 21:07.791
Here's a tissue.

21:08.055 --> 21:09.331
Thank you.

21:10.524 --> 21:12.064
It's gonna be okay.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.506
It's just so sad,

21:15.352 --> 21:18.834
how could I drop an entire box of M&M's on the floor?!

21:20.818 --> 21:22.816
Do you want me to go buy you a new one?

21:24.341 --> 21:25.367
It

21:25.756 --> 21:26.782
was

21:27.282 --> 21:28.239
the

21:28.336 --> 21:29.335
last

21:29.529 --> 21:30.736
one.
