01:09.256 --> 01:10.659
Okay, big guy, you and me.

01:11.851 --> 01:14.464
We've never done this before but...

01:14.834 --> 01:17.092
desperate times
call for desperate mesures.

01:17.524 --> 01:20.162
- My name is Hank.
- Hello, Hank.

01:21.904 --> 01:24.962
I'm sorry, sister,
I was just trying to have a little

01:25.084 --> 01:26.942
chat with your husband up there.

01:27.096 --> 01:28.346
Can I help you?

01:28.466 --> 01:31.557
No, I wouldn't want
to bother a real life person about it.

01:31.677 --> 01:34.494
It wouldn't be a bother, Hank.
In fact, that's why I'm here.

01:37.411 --> 01:38.791
Here is the thing.

01:39.509 --> 01:41.883
I'm having
what you might call a crisis of faith.

01:42.184 --> 01:44.165
I mean, to put it simply, I can't write.

01:44.411 --> 01:47.578
Which really kind of sucks
because I'm supposed to be a writer.

01:47.812 --> 01:49.709
And a professional one at that.

01:49.925 --> 01:53.719
And I can't seem to be able to produce
so much as a goddamn predicate.

01:54.194 --> 01:57.490
Sorry, you know,
my apologies, I fucked up...

01:58.206 --> 02:00.760
again... I apologize.

02:01.883 --> 02:03.860
Well, normally, I would suggest

02:03.980 --> 02:06.963
a bunch of Our fathers
or a couple Hail Maries...

02:07.300 --> 02:09.800
but I don't think
that's gonna get it done.

02:11.545 --> 02:13.029
What about a blow job?

02:16.239 --> 02:18.681
A blow job,
would that make you feel any better?

02:18.919 --> 02:20.463
A blow job from you?

02:21.624 --> 02:23.815
Something tells me
it's not gonna suck itself, Hank.

02:24.562 --> 02:25.727
No, but...

02:26.318 --> 02:27.595
But you're a nun.

02:29.473 --> 02:31.817
A totally fucking hot nun.

02:43.148 --> 02:45.054
Sweet baby Jesus...

02:45.458 --> 02:47.157
Hank is going to hell.

02:53.254 --> 02:54.286
Bad dream?

02:56.134 --> 02:57.200
Yeah...

02:57.646 --> 02:58.740
No...

02:59.234 --> 03:00.998
It's hard to say, really.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.959
You drifted off and I thought to myself

03:04.406 --> 03:07.224
So, what's the nicest possible
I can wake up mister Hank here.

03:07.346 --> 03:09.168
Kudos to you because you...

03:09.364 --> 03:11.943
you definitely stumbled
upon one of the nicer ways.

03:12.063 --> 03:13.677
You're nice to me, I'm nice to you.

03:13.797 --> 03:16.300
Yes, it's very quid pro quo...

03:16.420 --> 03:18.676
- What does that mean?
- Never mind.

03:19.244 --> 03:22.780
My husband,
he's never given me an orgasm.

03:22.900 --> 03:24.033
Never?

03:24.407 --> 03:27.150
- Ever.
- Does he , you know, go downtown?

03:27.270 --> 03:28.970
- Toward the south land?
- Never.

03:29.102 --> 03:32.397
- Going to the hood?
- Well, it's not true, yes, he has.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.764
But he made me take a shower first.

03:35.394 --> 03:38.399
Then, he's spent 45 minutes
trying to find my clit.

03:39.269 --> 03:40.441
How did he do?

03:40.591 --> 03:42.526
I'm pretty sure
he thinks it's in the bottom.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.291
Near the vaginas?

03:46.735 --> 03:48.220
That's weird.

03:50.537 --> 03:51.843
I can take a hint.

03:51.964 --> 03:54.012
I just so happen
to have my GPS with me.

03:54.182 --> 03:55.927
I've stored it up my ass, yes.

03:57.841 --> 03:59.128
Hello?

03:59.766 --> 04:01.537
Yours is on the bottom.

04:01.657 --> 04:03.738
I think I have found something.

04:06.709 --> 04:08.307
What the fuck is that?

04:08.495 --> 04:10.391
- It would be my husband.
- Okay.

04:10.523 --> 04:13.001
Maybe I should hide under your clit,
he'd never find me there.

04:13.124 --> 04:15.677
- Heather, whose piece of shit is that?
- I think I should go.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.625
All I need to do is to find my pants.
No pants anywhere?

04:23.887 --> 04:25.817
- What the fuck?
- It's not what you think.

04:25.939 --> 04:27.694
- Whose pants are these?
- Those are yours!

04:27.816 --> 04:28.966
Where is he?

04:34.901 --> 04:36.526
Motherfucker!

04:36.685 --> 04:38.216
Yeah, you!

04:39.337 --> 04:40.963
You gotta be kidding me!

04:41.083 --> 04:43.385
What are you,
like 60 years or something, bro'!

04:43.505 --> 04:45.743
Yo, KFed,
the little man in the boat?

04:45.904 --> 04:48.502
He's up here, that's where he is!

04:48.838 --> 04:50.215
- Right here!
- Just let him go!

04:50.335 --> 04:52.791
- Are you kidding me?
- You guys work it out.

04:52.923 --> 04:54.735
You're dead!

04:56.340 --> 04:57.862
Motherfucker!

05:10.070 --> 05:15.056
CALIFORNICATION 1x01

05:36.740 --> 05:39.294
Ladies, daddy's trying out a new look.

05:40.853 --> 05:42.164
What do you think?

05:42.284 --> 05:43.736
- Dad?
- Yes.

05:43.856 --> 05:45.641
Are you mentally insane?

05:45.961 --> 05:48.712
Yes, but I'm extremly high functioning.

05:48.991 --> 05:52.097
Much like a special needs person
that works at McDonald's.

05:52.217 --> 05:55.418
Exactly. I'm late, I'm sorry and...

05:55.719 --> 05:59.104
I'm not wearing any pants but
I would like to invite you two ladies

05:59.224 --> 06:01.702
to join me, to take you pants off,

06:01.822 --> 06:04.523
and come with me
to the pants off restaurant.

06:04.643 --> 06:08.511
It sounds tempting
but I got plans, okay?

06:08.866 --> 06:10.810
- It must be date night.
- Yeah.

06:11.007 --> 06:12.608
Come on, mom.

06:12.728 --> 06:15.232
Peanut, I can't but, you know,

06:16.742 --> 06:18.620
enjoy your daddy time.

06:18.883 --> 06:22.142
- Where is my kiss?
- You're really a classy guy, Hank.

06:22.262 --> 06:24.704
That's funny coming from you at all.

06:26.248 --> 06:28.633
So, who won that round?

06:28.783 --> 06:32.013
It's not wether you win or you lose,
it's how you play the game.

06:32.830 --> 06:34.745
Looks like a fun game.

06:35.149 --> 06:36.853
You think I made her laugh?

06:36.973 --> 06:38.246
Sure.

06:38.425 --> 06:39.786
A little.

06:39.965 --> 06:41.354
On the inside.

06:43.364 --> 06:45.796
- Yellow submarine?
- Pirates.

06:46.181 --> 06:47.451
Again?

06:47.813 --> 06:50.827
- Johnny Depp is hot!
- I concur but

06:50.986 --> 06:54.254
wouldn't you rather
expand your cinematic horizons and

06:54.845 --> 06:58.380
pick a film that's based on a piece of
litterature and not a theme park ride?

06:58.639 --> 07:00.708
Pirates it is.
Why don't you try my room?

07:01.756 --> 07:03.038
Depp...

07:09.499 --> 07:12.899
I don't think I have any sushi takeout,
I got the house of Chow.

07:13.019 --> 07:14.822
- which is chinese.
- Father?

07:15.349 --> 07:17.537
- Daughter?
- Can I ask you something?

07:17.657 --> 07:19.081
Yeah, anything, my love.

07:19.201 --> 07:21.581
Why is there a naked lady
in your bedroom?

07:26.172 --> 07:27.660
You wait...

07:27.900 --> 07:29.595
right there, okay?

07:29.872 --> 07:31.839
There's no hair on her vagina.

07:31.977 --> 07:33.639
Do you think she's okay?

07:35.775 --> 07:37.165
I'll check.

07:41.354 --> 07:43.013
What are you doing?

07:43.133 --> 07:46.088
- Hi, I thought I'd surprise you.
- You surprised my daughter.

07:46.208 --> 07:49.204
I'm so sorry, I mean, really
I should have call but I'm inside.

07:50.491 --> 07:52.237
You know what? I'm sorry.

07:52.361 --> 07:53.844
- Really?
- You know what, yes.

07:55.206 --> 07:57.985
Maybe we should think about
cooling things off a little bit.

07:58.595 --> 08:00.601
- Excuse me?
- Or not.

08:00.721 --> 08:02.027
Either way, I'm easy.

08:02.824 --> 08:04.610
God, you're amazing, Hank.

08:04.730 --> 08:07.651
I mean you spent all this time
sweet talking me into the sack but

08:07.857 --> 08:11.688
now you've exacted your revenge,
you're done with me, right?

08:11.979 --> 08:13.820
Revenge?
What are you talking about revenge?

08:13.940 --> 08:16.542
Please, do not make it like

08:16.662 --> 08:19.669
it wasn't in the least that satisfying
to fuck the wife of the man who turned

08:19.789 --> 08:22.621
your precious little book
into your big shitty movie.

08:22.781 --> 08:24.495
Now that you put it that way...

08:24.615 --> 08:26.382
What other way is there to put it, Hank?

08:26.502 --> 08:29.274
Now that you put it that way,
there is no other way to put it.

08:29.394 --> 08:31.420
- I think that's a very...
- Shut up!

08:31.540 --> 08:34.067
God, you shut up! And you know what?

08:34.187 --> 08:37.221
By the way, the truth is...

08:38.076 --> 08:39.475
the movie...

08:39.597 --> 08:41.530
is much better than the book.

08:41.653 --> 08:44.522
Okay, so not only
are you a cadaverous lay

08:44.642 --> 08:46.866
you also have shitty taste in movies.

08:48.131 --> 08:49.292
Hi.

08:50.047 --> 08:51.827
Thank you.

08:53.371 --> 08:54.732
Cheers!

08:56.496 --> 08:57.773
So...

08:57.923 --> 08:59.566
is this the new girlfriend?

09:18.596 --> 09:20.559
I wish we could take him with us.

09:23.546 --> 09:26.194
Why don't you get
your stuff together, honey, okay?

09:26.670 --> 09:29.423
- Don't yell at him.
- I'm not gonna yell at him...

09:30.229 --> 09:31.252
much.

09:36.589 --> 09:37.631
What?

09:38.936 --> 09:40.269
I know that look.

09:40.790 --> 09:43.964
That's the look that
shrivels my testies.

09:44.836 --> 09:48.083
Twelve years old finds naked slut
in dad's bedroom.

09:48.543 --> 09:49.923
Are you still feeling cute?

09:51.145 --> 09:53.699
- She mentioned that, huh?
- Yes, she mentioned that.

09:54.416 --> 09:55.459
So...

09:56.155 --> 09:58.014
- What, you're jealous?
- What?

09:58.711 --> 10:02.348
You're so lucky that I don't take away
the little custody you do have.

10:02.468 --> 10:03.875
Bill tried to convince me...

10:04.475 --> 10:07.829
You get a legal advice from your
boyfriend Bill, now? That's sweet!

10:08.281 --> 10:09.559
Don't start, okay?

10:09.679 --> 10:11.535
You started when you cheated on me.

10:11.655 --> 10:13.448
Shut up! I did not cheated on you.

10:13.568 --> 10:15.837
In what universe is fucking someone

10:15.957 --> 10:18.366
when you're married to somebody
else not cheating?

10:18.989 --> 10:20.914
The one in which you were
never actually married.

10:21.061 --> 10:23.165
That's a bullshit technicality.

10:23.416 --> 10:25.312
You never asked.
You don't wanna be that guy.

10:25.432 --> 10:26.724
You didn't wanna join the herd.

10:26.844 --> 10:28.160
That's what I dug about you.

10:28.439 --> 10:29.789
Imagine my fucking disappointment

10:29.909 --> 10:32.188
when you turned out to be
the biggest cliché of all,

10:32.341 --> 10:34.109
sitting there and googling yourself.

10:34.324 --> 10:36.217
- I saw you.
- I google myself

10:36.337 --> 10:38.479
but I never cheated on you. Never.

10:38.835 --> 10:41.104
Cheating isn't just about
fucking someone, Hank.

10:41.235 --> 10:43.451
I got a dictionary in there
that will differ with you!

10:43.583 --> 10:46.912
Bill and I didn't even touch each other
until we were dead and buried.

10:47.217 --> 10:49.236
Okay, are you trying to
make me throw up now?

10:49.772 --> 10:53.233
You are out there and sticking
your dick in anything that moves

10:53.353 --> 10:54.429
trying to get back at me.

10:54.727 --> 10:56.004
Which is fine.

10:57.238 --> 10:58.834
Do you know what the worst thing is?

11:00.204 --> 11:01.434
You are not writing.

11:02.270 --> 11:04.604
You have this gift, you have
this incredible talent,

11:04.724 --> 11:06.703
and you're just flushing it
down the toilet.

11:07.352 --> 11:08.526
Maybe you're right.

11:09.096 --> 11:10.297
No "maybes".

11:11.106 --> 11:12.373
You are right.

11:14.571 --> 11:16.204
I'm fucked up right now and I...

11:16.421 --> 11:17.670
I need help.

11:19.119 --> 11:22.143
- I do, I need you... baby...
- No, no, no...

11:22.750 --> 11:24.872
Hank, Hank, Hank, I...
I'm getting married.

11:26.992 --> 11:28.962
- What?
- He asked and I said "yes".

11:29.301 --> 11:31.288
Why the fuck would you
do something like that?

11:31.410 --> 11:33.041
- Because I love him.
- No, you don't.

11:33.161 --> 11:34.932
- Yes, I do. I do!
- You don't. You do not!

11:35.060 --> 11:36.909
- Yes, I do!
- You don't!

11:37.085 --> 11:39.725
- How do you know?
- 'Cause he's a fucking dial tone!

11:39.960 --> 11:41.961
He's everything you said
you never wanted.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.950
I'm sure he means well
and everything...

11:44.119 --> 11:45.984
I may be fucked up right now
but I can see it,

11:46.104 --> 11:48.016
he's not the guy for you.
I can see that.

11:48.136 --> 11:49.156
How do you know that?

11:49.341 --> 11:50.696
Because I know you.

11:52.839 --> 11:54.567
Don't I get some say in this?

11:56.257 --> 11:58.248
Are you sure?
Because it seems like I should,

11:58.685 --> 11:59.703
maybe.

12:05.936 --> 12:07.692
I guess that's it, huh?

12:07.942 --> 12:09.242
- Yeah.
- Okay.

12:12.047 --> 12:14.008
Best of luck in all
your future endeavors.

12:14.629 --> 12:15.690
Thank you.

12:17.666 --> 12:20.739
Good night, honey. Please don't use
the word "vagina" around me ever again.

12:20.859 --> 12:23.107
Don't forget to let me
know where you're registered.

12:23.314 --> 12:24.657
That's so sweet!

12:25.051 --> 12:28.638
And don't let the door hit you on
your soon-to-be huge ass on the way out.

13:02.047 --> 13:03.145
Talk to me.

13:04.781 --> 13:06.255
Baby, what's up?

13:07.011 --> 13:08.447
- No, I'm at the movies!
- Hey...

13:08.626 --> 13:09.877
Come on buddy, give me a break!

13:10.018 --> 13:12.254
I swear I called the house,
I talked to your mother.

13:12.735 --> 13:14.519
No, she said... What the fuck, man!

13:14.660 --> 13:16.106
What's up, baby girl!

13:16.539 --> 13:19.056
No, the asshole you're calling
is gonna have to call you back.

13:19.176 --> 13:21.412
Yes, sweetheart. Sometime
after the movie, all right?

13:21.532 --> 13:22.636
Give me the phone!

13:23.057 --> 13:24.653
Give me the phone! You know what?

13:24.846 --> 13:26.250
You don't touch the phone, okay?

13:26.479 --> 13:27.550
Stupid guy!

13:30.851 --> 13:31.960
Don't do it.

13:35.636 --> 13:38.012
Baby, I'm sorry but some stupid guy

13:38.132 --> 13:41.335
he takes the phone from me. He freaks
out like he's Mel Gibson or something.

13:41.603 --> 13:44.532
Forget about that, baby.
Forget, 'cause you know who I am.

13:44.701 --> 13:47.565
I don't care if I am at the movie
theater... What the fuck, man!

13:48.580 --> 13:49.800
Now, come on, take it.

13:53.144 --> 13:55.102
Next time put it on vibrate homey.

13:58.215 --> 13:59.887
Fucking turn it off!

14:01.094 --> 14:04.076
God forbid you should
pass up a fucking call!

14:04.902 --> 14:05.944
Dick.

14:08.441 --> 14:10.882
What the fuck! Piece of shit!

15:12.625 --> 15:13.724
What are you doing?

15:14.227 --> 15:16.764
What do you mean?
You were just like calling me over.

15:17.154 --> 15:19.408
No, I was like totally ambivalent.

15:21.219 --> 15:23.557
Listen, you better get up because

15:23.794 --> 15:25.749
my boyfriend will be back any second.

15:26.454 --> 15:27.947
You weird chick!

15:28.707 --> 15:30.299
I am, I'm also just kidding!

15:30.419 --> 15:31.646
Have a seat, please.

15:32.561 --> 15:33.960
What if I don't want to now?

15:34.912 --> 15:36.190
Fine, your loss. I mean...

15:36.310 --> 15:37.814
Why would I wanna get to know a guy

15:37.934 --> 15:39.896
who's so in love with himself
that he hangs out

15:40.037 --> 15:42.201
in a bookstores
reading his own work.

15:43.877 --> 15:46.994
If you're under the impression that
I'm in love with myself then it's...

15:47.357 --> 15:49.698
possible that
you are higher than me right now.

15:50.022 --> 15:52.247
So I'm battling some low self-esteem.

15:52.487 --> 15:54.102
You have no idea.

15:55.510 --> 15:56.581
Poor baby.

15:59.538 --> 16:01.576
Hank, my name is Hank.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.547
I know.

16:04.379 --> 16:06.497
- Mia.
- Nice to meet you, Mia.

16:07.278 --> 16:08.339
Likewise.

16:09.213 --> 16:10.405
Can I ask you a question?

16:11.241 --> 16:12.256
Sure.

16:12.583 --> 16:13.620
Did you...

16:14.787 --> 16:16.285
see that movie?

16:19.355 --> 16:20.378
And what did you think?

16:20.655 --> 16:22.589
- Honestly?
- Yes, brutal truth.

16:24.544 --> 16:25.811
It really sucked.

16:26.201 --> 16:28.788
The director ruined it,
he should be shot.

16:28.908 --> 16:30.516
I took care of him already.

16:33.097 --> 16:35.074
So you're like this...

16:35.642 --> 16:36.830
famous writer, huh?

16:37.342 --> 16:39.519
Hardly, more like a one hit wonder.

16:39.962 --> 16:42.634
Well, now I'm definitely...

16:42.974 --> 16:45.547
for sure, absolutely...

16:46.127 --> 16:47.845
not going to sleep with you.

16:52.723 --> 16:54.098
Are you gonna cum?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.437
I don't see why not.

17:29.070 --> 17:30.648
I'm happy to report that Becca

17:30.770 --> 17:32.188
is a delightful student.

17:32.730 --> 17:35.456
Smart, inquisitive, full of life.

17:35.576 --> 17:38.667
And yet I sense a big hairy "but"
lurking around the corner.

17:39.121 --> 17:40.765
This is my life. Can you take those off?

17:41.129 --> 17:43.923
It's okay, he is right, but...

17:44.082 --> 17:46.805
I'm slightly worried
about her emerging sexuality.

17:46.968 --> 17:48.113
Oh, thank god.

17:48.758 --> 17:50.846
She's a lesbian. Thank god.

17:51.486 --> 17:54.233
- What are you talking about?
- I think we can all agree

17:54.412 --> 17:55.954
by and large
that men are assholes.

17:56.226 --> 17:59.627
I, for one, am happy
that she prefers the fairer sex.

17:59.838 --> 18:02.319
It looks like we're the proud parents
of a lesbian daughter.

18:02.563 --> 18:03.426
Up high!

18:03.613 --> 18:05.634
Let's celebrate.
Come on, don't leave me hanging...

18:05.888 --> 18:07.966
What? You're ashamed
of our gay daughter?

18:09.223 --> 18:10.416
What happened to your eye?

18:10.735 --> 18:13.667
Okay, hold on a second here, folks.

18:13.787 --> 18:15.662
Becca is not a lesbian.

18:16.582 --> 18:17.794
- She's not?
- No.

18:17.914 --> 18:19.122
Based on what I've seen, no.

18:19.242 --> 18:22.042
Then, why are we discussing
her sexuality?

18:22.162 --> 18:25.308
Because it seems, she very recently
has discovered

18:25.453 --> 18:28.174
- the attention of boys.
- Well, she's beautiful.

18:28.353 --> 18:30.020
She takes after her mother.

18:30.886 --> 18:33.046
The make up and the slutty clothes.

18:33.299 --> 18:35.530
I caught her making out
with this boy last week.

18:35.650 --> 18:36.918
- And he...
- He was what?

18:37.489 --> 18:38.493
Feeling her up.

18:38.615 --> 18:41.158
She is 12 years old.
What, there's nothing there to feel...

18:41.278 --> 18:43.880
You know, I don't see why
we should put such a negative

18:44.000 --> 18:46.883
spin on this, I mean,
she's growing up, it's only natural.

18:47.021 --> 18:49.688
- I'll talk to her.
- No. No, I will talk to her.

18:49.852 --> 18:52.892
No, because you're just gonna loose
your shit and that's gonna make--

18:53.014 --> 18:54.787
You'll talk to her
she'll wind up pregnant.

18:54.919 --> 18:56.845
Then everything will be fine
and fucking dandy.

18:56.979 --> 18:58.011
Oh, my god.

18:58.668 --> 19:02.565
- You're such a funny asshole.
- Folks, I only bring it up because...

19:03.309 --> 19:05.854
When I told her it was
an inappropriate behaviour, she said...

19:05.974 --> 19:08.657
"How else do we get boys to like you?"

19:16.835 --> 19:17.835
So...

19:18.229 --> 19:19.366
I...

19:20.360 --> 19:22.285
have an offer for you!

19:23.196 --> 19:25.303
Forgive me, I haven't heard
that one in a while.

19:25.423 --> 19:26.593
Don't get too excited.

19:26.903 --> 19:30.434
I wish you would've said that before
the blood started rushing into my cock.

19:30.584 --> 19:32.302
Lovely, thank you for that image.

19:32.564 --> 19:36.160
- Are you familiar with Hell-A magazine?
- Hell, no.

19:36.282 --> 19:38.726
Now, they would like you
to blog for them.

19:38.999 --> 19:39.974
Fuck me.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.203
Must be my trick ear
but I thought you said "blog".

19:42.323 --> 19:44.134
The good people at Hell-A,

19:44.374 --> 19:46.816
are very interested in your thoughts

19:47.017 --> 19:50.290
on the battle between the sexes
and this adopted city of yours.

19:50.591 --> 19:51.746
Do you have a gun?

19:55.980 --> 19:59.452
You know, I did have a very hot dream
about a nun the other night

19:59.572 --> 20:02.840
- who gave me a blow job...
- There you go, a nun and a blow job.

20:02.972 --> 20:05.284
- This excellent, excellent.
- You think?

20:05.404 --> 20:07.454
Doesn't take Freud
to figure it out but...

20:08.211 --> 20:10.892
Well, Hank, have we established
that you have a certain

20:11.012 --> 20:13.291
predilection for the company
of unavailable women?

20:13.459 --> 20:16.122
- No, we haven't established that.
- I've established it.

20:16.242 --> 20:19.826
And what would be the ultimate
manifestation of such a fetish?

20:20.279 --> 20:21.876
Perhaps, getting a blow-job,

20:21.996 --> 20:24.749
from a woman
who is essentially married to God...

20:25.155 --> 20:26.806
Can it just be that it's naughty?

20:29.521 --> 20:31.972
What the fuck is going on with you, man?

20:32.812 --> 20:33.981
How are you?

20:35.047 --> 20:37.122
I'm fine, I'm...

20:37.837 --> 20:39.706
I'm disgusted with my life...

20:39.922 --> 20:42.363
and myself
but I'm not unhappy about that.

20:43.517 --> 20:44.530
How are you?

20:47.866 --> 20:50.109
Okay, as your friend and agent,

20:50.229 --> 20:51.697
may I simply suggest...

20:51.945 --> 20:54.454
that you may be try
to start looking for a nice girl.

20:54.574 --> 20:55.608
A nice girl?

20:55.738 --> 20:57.979
I wouldn't know
what to say to a nice girl.

20:58.101 --> 21:00.741
Seeing as you're 10 s away
from sitting at a dinner with one

21:00.891 --> 21:03.081
- you better figure something out.
- That's not cool.

21:03.203 --> 21:04.767
- I'm naughty, too.
- Motherfucker.

21:04.887 --> 21:06.376
- Hello, wife.
- Hello boys.

21:07.610 --> 21:08.653
So, Hank...

21:09.263 --> 21:10.275
Meredith...

21:11.228 --> 21:12.266
You're a writer.

21:12.783 --> 21:14.427
Once upon a time, I was, yeah...

21:14.770 --> 21:17.333
in a little place I like
to call New York City.

21:18.267 --> 21:19.309
I've heard of it.

21:19.626 --> 21:20.771
He's still a writer.

21:21.152 --> 21:22.289
A great writer.

21:22.409 --> 21:25.467
No, that's, see, that's where
you're wrong and the writers write.

21:25.587 --> 21:27.288
That what they do. Me...

21:27.626 --> 21:29.771
Not so much, nothing. <i>Nada</i>.

21:29.978 --> 21:32.397
Well, have you written anything
I might have read?

21:32.664 --> 21:35.021
Well, that depends on
whether or not you read, Meredith.

21:36.156 --> 21:37.833
- I read, Hank.
- Excellent.

21:37.953 --> 21:40.025
Most recently, I gave man birth

21:40.145 --> 21:42.473
to a weighty tome called
"God hates us all."

21:42.593 --> 21:43.868
Such a catchy title, no?

21:43.988 --> 21:46.284
Which was subsequently
turned into a movie called...

21:46.404 --> 21:49.078
"A crazy little thing called love".

21:49.198 --> 21:50.544
The one with Tom and Katie?

21:50.769 --> 21:52.346
- I love that.
- Swell.

21:52.468 --> 21:53.755
That was such a sweet movie.

21:53.888 --> 21:56.387
- You liked it?
- Well, congrats, Hanks.

21:56.507 --> 21:58.151
You must be really proud.

21:59.727 --> 22:00.992
Like you wouldn't believe.

22:07.368 --> 22:08.559
Tell me about yourself.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.224
What would you like to know?

22:10.344 --> 22:12.286
Well, just the Cliffs Notes
would be fine.

22:13.329 --> 22:15.758
Well, I don't know, Hank,
you seem to have me all...

22:16.004 --> 22:17.767
figured out,
why don't you give it a try?

22:18.104 --> 22:20.776
Yeah, why don't we order
a little something, some wine maybe?

22:20.896 --> 22:23.888
Honey, trust me, getting your asshole
bleached would be much more fun.

22:24.008 --> 22:26.348
Yeah, is there a waiter?
Perhaps, waiter, <i>garçon</i> ?

22:26.468 --> 22:28.621
- I don't think you want to hear that.
- Sure I do.

22:28.808 --> 22:31.130
Tell me a little bit about myself,
I mean, that's what

22:31.289 --> 22:34.645
writers do, right? They make up stuff.
Come on, it'll be fun.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.999
I think you were born in the Valley.

22:39.617 --> 22:40.746
Nice part though...

22:40.926 --> 22:43.424
Hidden Hills, Calabasas
or something like that?

22:43.980 --> 22:46.046
Your father was middle-management

22:46.166 --> 22:47.603
white collar executive.

22:47.932 --> 22:49.110
Stay-at-home mum.

22:49.816 --> 22:52.961
You didn't want to stray too far to go
to College so you went to USC.

22:53.918 --> 22:55.022
UCLA?

22:55.407 --> 22:57.377
No, no, S-C, S-C.

22:57.497 --> 22:59.067
You had a serious boyfriend in college

22:59.187 --> 23:01.447
who broke up right after,
he married the next one.

23:01.961 --> 23:05.271
You got a low maitenance gig
in human resources industry.

23:05.391 --> 23:08.214
You got a string of bad relationships,
you put on some weight.

23:08.823 --> 23:11.275
You looked around and saw
all your friends starting to pair up

23:11.397 --> 23:13.813
and get married so you decided
you should loose the weight,

23:13.935 --> 23:16.302
you joined a gym, got addicted,
maybe did a little running.

23:16.664 --> 23:17.941
Say you wanna work.

23:18.205 --> 23:20.279
Maybe start your own
party planning business

23:20.399 --> 23:22.530
fancy yourself kind of
a poor girl’s Martha Stewart.

23:22.650 --> 23:24.163
But what you really wanna do?

23:24.414 --> 23:26.147
Sit at home, on the couch

23:26.288 --> 23:28.969
with some poor sap watching reality TV

23:29.089 --> 23:30.677
while he watches you get fat again.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.877
Now you're giving me that look right now

23:35.074 --> 23:37.063
look like I finger banged your cat.

23:39.714 --> 23:43.393
But what you really think is if I manage
to get outta here in the next 15 mins

23:43.529 --> 23:46.421
I can still make it at home in time
to watch America Next Top Model,

23:46.562 --> 23:48.646
which I have tivoed, I swear to god!

23:49.105 --> 23:50.608
That show is fierce!

23:52.371 --> 23:54.306
- You're a real prick, you know that?
- Guilty.

23:54.426 --> 23:55.498
Guilty as charged.

23:56.037 --> 23:57.230
I thought she liked me.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.078
- I thought it was going well.
- Sweet.

24:01.158 --> 24:04.001
- She did ask for it.
- Yeah, totally, she got it.

24:05.726 --> 24:06.881
Go home, honey.

24:07.325 --> 24:08.405
Sleep it off.

24:09.151 --> 24:10.630
Tomorrow is another day.

24:22.151 --> 24:23.245
What's wrong?

24:25.118 --> 24:26.930
Just thought that you were gonna hit me.

24:28.151 --> 24:30.029
- Why?
- No reason.

24:30.751 --> 24:31.991
As you were.

24:33.385 --> 24:34.547
Defile me.

24:41.835 --> 24:42.897
Yeah, hello?

24:44.418 --> 24:46.155
Not the best time, no.

24:49.584 --> 24:51.274
Okay, okay, I'll be right there.

24:52.131 --> 24:54.478
- Are you kidding me?
- Consider yourself defiled.

24:54.607 --> 24:55.633
You're an asshole!

25:01.357 --> 25:03.631
- Where?
- Somewhere up in the Palisades.

25:07.991 --> 25:09.814
- Who did she go with?
- Bill's daughter.

25:09.973 --> 25:11.994
Didn't know Bill had a daughter.
How old is she?

25:12.114 --> 25:14.283
- Sixteen.
- And you let Becca hang out with her?

25:14.403 --> 25:15.501
Yeah, she's a good kid:

25:15.623 --> 25:18.376
she's the one that called
to tell me that Becca was in trouble.

25:20.763 --> 25:21.834
What?

25:23.759 --> 25:24.782
What?

25:25.392 --> 25:26.641
You smell like pussy.

25:27.617 --> 25:28.745
Thank you.

25:58.781 --> 25:59.805
As you were.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.335
I hate you.

26:37.158 --> 26:38.823
All right, I guess I deserved that.

26:39.571 --> 26:40.886
No one deserves that.

26:42.405 --> 26:43.523
You wanna come in?

26:44.326 --> 26:46.245
What about the lord of the manor?

26:46.365 --> 26:47.477
He's outta town.

26:48.771 --> 26:49.909
Sure.

26:51.666 --> 26:52.942
Wash the pussy off.

26:57.720 --> 26:58.884
That happens.

26:59.261 --> 27:01.380
It was gonna happen, sooner or later.

27:01.869 --> 27:04.011
- Do you think I was wrong?
- No, you did exactly

27:04.152 --> 27:06.508
what I wanted to do
which doesn't make it right.

27:06.717 --> 27:09.186
I just reacted. Just picked her up.

27:09.551 --> 27:11.692
Yeah, you've always been a walking id.

27:12.191 --> 27:14.998
Which oddly enough
is the title of my next novel.

27:16.340 --> 27:17.534
What next novel?

27:17.857 --> 27:20.110
Hey, let's just talk about Becca.

27:20.892 --> 27:22.838
Well it's all kinda the same thing,
isn't it?

27:23.056 --> 27:24.224
You called me.

27:24.567 --> 27:27.514
Yeah, your daughter was in trouble,
I thought you should know.

27:27.634 --> 27:29.768
Oh, bullshit. You were alone
and you freaked out.

27:29.888 --> 27:31.162
You wanted me to handle it.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.484
I want you in my life, I...

27:33.735 --> 27:35.230
Because you're still in love with me

27:35.365 --> 27:37.798
and you wanna have like 10.000
more of my babies.

27:37.919 --> 27:39.481
No, it's because...

27:39.601 --> 27:42.200
what happens to Becca
is our responsability

27:42.320 --> 27:44.606
and like it or not,
we're tied to each other for life.

27:44.726 --> 27:46.794
- Yes.
- Minus the obvious...

27:46.931 --> 27:48.499
Sexual benefits.

27:48.989 --> 27:51.121
You seem to have that
pretty well covered right now.

27:51.293 --> 27:52.754
Don't sell yourself short.

27:52.874 --> 27:55.566
As I recall, our problems
did not extend to the bedroom.

27:55.792 --> 27:57.247
Please stop.

28:00.882 --> 28:03.145
God, we just kinda sucked
at everything else.

28:04.541 --> 28:06.375
We were great once and you know it.

28:06.735 --> 28:07.758
Hank...

28:09.880 --> 28:11.176
What are you doing?

28:13.185 --> 28:14.349
Marry me.

28:17.082 --> 28:18.970
- What?
- Don't marry him.

28:19.153 --> 28:20.187
Marry me.

28:22.507 --> 28:24.240
Hank, don't fuck with me.

28:24.398 --> 28:26.521
I'm not fucking with you.
I don't work without you.

28:26.962 --> 28:29.939
Oh, I get it, you want your muse back?

28:30.117 --> 28:32.252
You'll save me.
And I'll save you.

28:32.860 --> 28:34.935
I fucked up, I think we fucked up and...

28:35.218 --> 28:37.359
in matters big and small
and I never asked you.

28:38.697 --> 28:39.980
I'm asking you now.

28:41.426 --> 28:42.534
Marry me.

28:44.979 --> 28:46.750
You so wanna get with me right now.

28:54.058 --> 28:55.157
I'm so sorry.

28:55.565 --> 28:56.969
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

28:57.372 --> 28:59.990
This is Mia. Bill's daughter.
And this is Hank.

29:01.872 --> 29:04.034
You two know each other?

29:06.080 --> 29:07.578
Well...

29:08.708 --> 29:10.412
I do recognize you...

29:11.559 --> 29:13.585
Yeah, sure I do...

29:15.031 --> 29:16.261
from your book.

29:16.457 --> 29:18.209
Your picture is on the back.

29:18.329 --> 29:19.449
Right.

29:20.070 --> 29:21.267
How is she?

29:22.004 --> 29:23.234
Well, she hates us.

29:23.694 --> 29:24.934
You know, she's fine.

29:25.626 --> 29:27.631
And that was very cool
what you did tonight.

29:28.479 --> 29:31.691
It's nice to see some good
old-fashioned family values in this...

29:32.241 --> 29:34.627
morally bankrupt city of ours.

29:34.889 --> 29:37.200
That's me,
I'm all about the family values.

29:38.430 --> 29:39.736
What happened to your eye?

29:40.615 --> 29:42.352
Yeah, what did happen to your eye, hank?

29:42.634 --> 29:44.357
Well, you should see the other guy...

29:45.624 --> 29:47.503
I hope she doesn't press charges...

29:47.662 --> 29:48.944
It's not a "she"...

29:49.451 --> 29:51.179
It was a "he", the other guy.

29:51.320 --> 29:52.353
Right.

29:52.672 --> 29:54.338
Well whatever, I'm off to bed.

29:54.458 --> 29:55.958
Good night. It was...

29:56.160 --> 29:58.220
- nice to meet you, Hank.
- Nice to meet you too.

30:03.658 --> 30:05.226
She seems nice.

30:05.525 --> 30:06.840
She is. She is great.

30:06.960 --> 30:09.215
- She is a good kid.
- How old might she be?

30:09.607 --> 30:10.734
She's sixteen.

30:11.214 --> 30:12.721
Sixteen? Wow...

30:12.907 --> 30:13.917
Sixteen...

30:14.037 --> 30:15.729
I know what you're thinking...

30:16.077 --> 30:18.264
No, I don't think you do.

30:19.766 --> 30:21.176
Give me a break.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.106
Your jaw is practically
on the fucking floor, Hank.

30:24.470 --> 30:26.058
You're such a dirty old man.

30:26.178 --> 30:27.179
No, I'm not.

30:27.471 --> 30:28.890
Oh, I'm just fucking with you.

30:33.772 --> 30:34.918
Good bye.
