00:38.165 --> 00:39.741
- Booyah!
- God.

00:39.775 --> 00:43.011
Guess who's about to
have the best day ever?

00:43.045 --> 00:45.981
Could it be the fellow
who just interrupted us, rather rudely,

00:46.015 --> 00:47.182
with "booyah"?

00:47.216 --> 00:48.984
What's going on, Dad?

00:49.018 --> 00:50.919
I'm sorry. I can't tell you.
I'm sworn to secrecy.

00:50.953 --> 00:52.487
Okay. Anyway.

00:52.522 --> 00:54.022
So my psych professor said
fear is an emotion...

00:54.056 --> 00:55.190
Which it is, but then I arg...

00:55.224 --> 00:57.325
You're not even gonna try
to pry the secret out of me?

00:57.360 --> 00:59.828
Darling, we are right in the
middle of something here,

00:59.862 --> 01:01.363
so if you just wait for a moment,

01:01.397 --> 01:03.265
we will give you our full attention, okay?

01:03.299 --> 01:04.331
Okay.

01:04.367 --> 01:05.266
What is it, darling?

01:05.301 --> 01:07.035
Gram, you know he's just gonna keep pouting

01:07.069 --> 01:09.371
until he gets his way.

01:10.573 --> 01:12.607
Dad, just tell us your secret.

01:12.642 --> 01:15.010
- Okay, but only because you insisted.
- Okay.

01:15.044 --> 01:16.077
I just got off the phone

01:16.112 --> 01:18.547
with the personal assistant
of none other than...

01:18.581 --> 01:19.948
Stephen King.

01:19.982 --> 01:20.949
Whoa!

01:20.983 --> 01:23.018
He's in town visiting
his New York apartment,

01:23.052 --> 01:24.786
has called to see if I'm available

01:24.820 --> 01:27.689
for a meeting to talk about a...
Dramatic pause...

01:31.160 --> 01:32.360
collaboration.

01:32.395 --> 01:33.361
Ooh!

01:33.396 --> 01:36.965
Hold on.
Isn't he still mad about the thing?

01:36.999 --> 01:38.300
What thing?

01:38.334 --> 01:39.334
The baseball thing.

01:39.368 --> 01:41.770
See, Stephen King is a
huge Red Sox fan and...

01:41.804 --> 01:44.573
Oh, and your father is a Yankees fan.

01:44.607 --> 01:46.608
Oh, no, Richard. What did you do?

01:46.642 --> 01:47.839
It was a silly joke.

01:47.918 --> 01:48.643
- Mm.
- Ah.

01:48.678 --> 01:49.911
More like a thinly veiled threat.

01:49.946 --> 01:50.812
Tomato, to-mah-to.

01:50.846 --> 01:52.013
Obviously it's water under the bridge,

01:52.048 --> 01:55.450
because he wants to talk about
collaborating on a project.

01:55.484 --> 01:58.620
"Richard Castle and
Stephen King present."

01:58.654 --> 01:59.888
Wish me luck, ladies.

01:59.922 --> 02:00.956
Darling, if you think

02:00.990 --> 02:03.391
you're going to get top
billing over Stephen King,

02:03.426 --> 02:05.620
you're going to need more than luck.

02:10.098 --> 02:11.433
Good morning. Morning.

02:11.467 --> 02:12.100
Morning, Captain.

02:12.134 --> 02:13.602
Hey, Lanie, how you doing?

02:13.636 --> 02:16.137
A heck of a lot better
than our victim here.

02:16.172 --> 02:18.607
Name is Emma Matthews, 34 years old,

02:18.641 --> 02:20.742
single GSW to the upper back...

02:20.776 --> 02:22.010
Through and through.

02:22.044 --> 02:23.578
Here's our exit wound.

02:23.613 --> 02:24.346
Based on lividity,

02:24.380 --> 02:25.780
I'm placing the time of death

02:25.815 --> 02:27.349
between 9:00 and 11:00 last night.

02:27.383 --> 02:29.184
And the neighbors didn't hear a gunshot?

02:29.218 --> 02:31.286
No, the music was turned up too loud.

02:31.320 --> 02:32.787
But the neighbor next door

02:32.822 --> 02:34.990
said he saw a rusty,
white van parked outside

02:35.024 --> 02:38.026
near the time-of-death window...
Didn't get a plate, though.

02:38.060 --> 02:39.327
Does Emma have a roommate?

02:39.362 --> 02:40.962
No. She lives alone.

02:40.997 --> 02:42.030
But we've, uh, notified next of kin,

02:42.064 --> 02:44.366
and we've got a list of
her friends and co-workers.

02:44.400 --> 02:47.102
Emma was a television
producer at Channel 8 News.

02:47.136 --> 02:49.037
Some of her co-workers
are gonna meet us back at the precinct.

02:49.090 --> 02:50.939
And what's with the artwork?

02:50.973 --> 02:51.973
Not sure yet,

02:52.008 --> 02:54.042
but we think that our
killer may have drawn it.

02:54.076 --> 02:55.810
All right, check with the FBI,

02:55.845 --> 02:57.445
see if the M.O. or if the symbol

02:57.480 --> 02:59.981
matches anything in their database.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.037
Hey, Beckett.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.738
So, how's the meeting going?

03:23.773 --> 03:25.407
Is Stephen still mad at you?

03:25.441 --> 03:26.808
I just got here.

03:26.842 --> 03:27.976
And if he's not still mad at me,

03:28.010 --> 03:30.045
he will be when I tell him to
fire his real-estate agent.

03:30.079 --> 03:31.379
Hey. Be nice.

03:31.414 --> 03:34.182
What, to Stephen or to the team of rats

03:34.216 --> 03:36.084
that came to welcome me at the door?

03:36.118 --> 03:37.952
All right. I got to go. I love you.

04:01.444 --> 04:02.644
Stephen, is that you?

04:06.248 --> 04:08.183
Oh.

04:08.217 --> 04:10.085
I get it. Very funny.

04:10.119 --> 04:13.288
Yeah, Yankees are still the best team...

04:13.322 --> 04:15.508
Hey, Ryan, anything from the FBI?

04:15.548 --> 04:17.540
No. The symbol's not in their database.

04:17.660 --> 04:19.017
Neither is our killer's M.O.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.463
And what about the white, rusty van
outside of Emma's apartment?

04:21.497 --> 04:22.631
You guys track it down?

04:22.665 --> 04:25.400
No traffic cams on her block,
so so far it's not looking good.

04:25.435 --> 04:26.568
Hey, guys.

04:26.602 --> 04:27.803
These are Emma's co-workers.

04:27.837 --> 04:29.171
This is Lila Campo and Jennifer Perez.

04:29.205 --> 04:30.739
This is my partner, Detective Ryan,

04:30.773 --> 04:31.873
and our boss, Captain Beckett.

04:31.908 --> 04:33.175
I'm sorry about your loss.

04:33.209 --> 04:35.577
Thank you, Captain.
We are still in shock.

04:35.611 --> 04:37.079
We're gonna talk over here. Mm-hmm.

04:37.113 --> 04:38.814
Follow me, please.

04:38.848 --> 04:42.189
Ryan, I'm gonna be at the forensic
technology seminar all afternoon.

04:42.255 --> 04:44.019
So just text me if anything comes up,
okay?

04:44.053 --> 04:46.121
- Yeah, you got it, Cap.
- Thanks.

04:52.261 --> 04:53.028
Oh, my God.

04:53.062 --> 04:54.429
Is that Emma's blood?

04:54.464 --> 04:56.031
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

04:56.065 --> 04:58.900
Do you recognize the
symbol drawn on the mirror?

04:59.411 --> 05:00.936
I've never seen it before.

05:00.970 --> 05:02.838
Neither have I.

05:02.872 --> 05:03.905
I mean, I just can't believe this.

05:03.940 --> 05:06.074
Emma... Emma was the
sweetest person in the world.

05:06.109 --> 05:08.844
I mean, she was kind,
she was outgoing...

05:08.878 --> 05:11.523
though she had been acting
a little strange lately.

05:11.695 --> 05:12.764
Strange how?

05:12.856 --> 05:15.917
Well, Emma had just gotten a promotion
to produce the 11:00 news.

05:15.952 --> 05:17.853
- Which was a huge deal for her.
- Exactly.

05:17.887 --> 05:20.055
Yet all this week,
she was acting kind of...

05:20.089 --> 05:21.189
I don't know.

05:21.224 --> 05:22.190
- Off.
- Yeah.

05:22.225 --> 05:23.994
Well, any idea why?

05:24.152 --> 05:27.262
Well, Emma confided in me
that she had gotten her hands on

05:27.296 --> 05:29.131
some kind of proof.

05:29.165 --> 05:30.799
Uh, proof of what?

05:30.833 --> 05:32.567
She said that she couldn't tell me,

05:32.602 --> 05:34.436
at least not until after
the time was right,

05:34.470 --> 05:35.771
whatever that meant.

05:35.805 --> 05:36.838
Do either of you know

05:36.873 --> 05:38.807
if Emma was having personal
problems with anyone,

05:38.841 --> 05:40.942
anyone at work, in her personal life?

05:40.977 --> 05:42.077
Not that I know of.

05:42.111 --> 05:42.944
Well, there's Buckley.

05:42.979 --> 05:45.714
Yeah, but everybody in the newsroom
has problems with Buckley.

05:45.748 --> 05:46.548
Who's Buckley?

05:46.582 --> 05:48.216
Another producer at the station...

05:48.251 --> 05:49.584
He had seniority over Emma,

05:49.619 --> 05:51.053
but she beat him out for that promotion.

05:51.087 --> 05:52.220
And Buckley was pissed.

05:52.255 --> 05:53.321
Yeah, I mean, he even claimed

05:53.356 --> 05:55.724
that she'd made up lies about
him just to get the job.

05:55.758 --> 05:58.427
But I can't imagine he
would kill her for that.

05:58.461 --> 06:01.821
By any chance,
does Buckley drive a white van?

06:03.365 --> 06:05.634
Yeah, he does.

06:35.565 --> 06:37.399
What, am I in kindergarten again?

06:42.004 --> 06:43.805
So where's Mrs. Finch?

06:48.010 --> 06:49.978
You are not Mrs. Finch.

06:50.012 --> 06:51.580
Who are you guys?

06:57.086 --> 06:58.520
Where am I?

06:58.554 --> 06:59.254
I don't know.

06:59.288 --> 07:01.355
Me and this guy just woke up.

07:03.159 --> 07:05.233
My shoulder's killing me.

07:09.165 --> 07:11.605
Anyone have a phone? Mine's gone.

07:12.001 --> 07:12.901
No.

07:12.935 --> 07:14.069
What the hell is going on?

07:14.103 --> 07:15.070
How did we get here?

07:15.104 --> 07:18.073
Last thing I remember I-I went to a...

07:18.107 --> 07:20.475
a run-down building going
to meet Stephen King

07:20.510 --> 07:22.177
and then all the lights went out.

07:22.211 --> 07:24.546
Hold on... 143 Nicholas Street?

07:24.580 --> 07:26.047
How did you know that?

07:26.849 --> 07:28.717
A lawyer called,
asked me to meet him there...

07:28.751 --> 07:29.651
Said I inherited the building

07:29.685 --> 07:31.920
from my uncle who
passed away a year ago.

07:31.954 --> 07:32.754
Yeah, I was told the same thing,

07:32.788 --> 07:35.023
except it was supposedly my cousin

07:35.057 --> 07:36.825
who died a few months ago.

07:36.859 --> 07:38.193
Oh, my God.

07:38.227 --> 07:39.895
We were all lured there.

07:42.031 --> 07:44.461
Yeah, but by whom?

07:45.301 --> 07:48.336
There's a sticky substance on my arms.

07:48.371 --> 07:49.971
Do you guys have that?

07:51.474 --> 07:53.675
This thing's not budging.

08:01.551 --> 08:03.051
Okay, um...

08:03.085 --> 08:05.401
You know, when I was in that hallway,

08:05.888 --> 08:06.955
when the lights went out,

08:06.989 --> 08:10.525
last thing I remember was a
sharp pain in my shoulder.

08:10.560 --> 08:14.529
So we must have been drugged
with a syringe or a tranq dart.

08:14.564 --> 08:17.098
But why? Who would do that to us?

08:19.168 --> 08:21.336
My guess is whoever's
behind that camera.

08:25.107 --> 08:26.875
Oh, man, it's a serial killer.

08:28.286 --> 08:30.045
I've seen stuff like this on "Dateline,"

08:30.079 --> 08:30.879
and it never ends well.

08:30.913 --> 08:31.813
Will you please shut the hell up?

08:31.847 --> 08:33.280
I'm just trying to tell you,
this is a...

08:33.316 --> 08:35.951
- Shut up!
- Guys...

08:35.985 --> 08:37.652
whoever is behind this,

08:37.687 --> 08:39.955
if they wanted us dead,
we would be dead.

08:39.989 --> 08:42.823
So, obviously,
they want something else, right?

08:42.857 --> 08:44.726
Yeah, b-but what?

08:44.760 --> 08:46.161
I don't know.

08:46.195 --> 08:47.796
Let's take a look around.

08:47.830 --> 08:49.464
Obviously someone went
through a lot of trouble

08:49.498 --> 08:51.366
designing this place.

09:00.643 --> 09:03.850
Hey. Guys.

09:05.014 --> 09:07.015
"Salvation lies within."

09:07.049 --> 09:08.083
What is that thing?

09:08.117 --> 09:09.284
It's a cryptex.

09:09.318 --> 09:10.852
It's kind of a lock box

09:10.886 --> 09:13.088
that requires a password to open it.

09:13.122 --> 09:14.656
So we just need the password.

09:14.690 --> 09:18.059
We need to bust out of here... now.

09:25.001 --> 09:27.168
The blade's rubber.

09:28.337 --> 09:30.305
Whoa. Is that a bee?

09:30.339 --> 09:32.607
I'm allergic. I'm very allergic!

09:32.642 --> 09:34.009
Okay, well, relax.
You're antagonizing it.

09:34.043 --> 09:36.177
I think it's attracted to
the stuff that's on my arm.

09:38.848 --> 09:42.450
Oh, no.

09:42.485 --> 09:43.451
Are you all right?

09:43.486 --> 09:44.319
Okay, relax. Relax.

09:44.353 --> 09:45.620
You're going into anaphylactic shock.

09:45.655 --> 09:46.554
Do you have epinephrine?

09:46.589 --> 09:49.224
My injector's gone! It was in my pocket!

09:49.258 --> 09:52.127
Where is it? Where is it?!

09:52.161 --> 09:53.128
It's okay, man. It's okay.

09:53.162 --> 09:53.962
We'll find it.

09:53.996 --> 09:55.830
Guys, there's a picture of a bee.

09:55.865 --> 09:59.167
Maybe your epinephrine's in here.

09:59.201 --> 10:00.902
W-What should we do?

10:00.936 --> 10:01.703
Uh...

10:01.737 --> 10:03.204
we need the password.

10:05.441 --> 10:07.142
Just breathe. Just breathe.

10:07.176 --> 10:09.477
All right? We'll figure this out.

10:09.512 --> 10:12.314
Guys, some of the letters
have little bees over them.

10:14.517 --> 10:17.519
- A-D-E...
- What the hell?

10:17.553 --> 10:20.522
- I-L-O...
- Take it easy.

10:20.556 --> 10:22.157
- Okay...
- P, R, and Y.

10:22.191 --> 10:23.491
What does that mean?

10:23.526 --> 10:24.426
I don't know.

10:24.460 --> 10:26.227
It could be a word, maybe it's a phrase.

10:26.262 --> 10:28.263
- Uh, "dairy pole"...
- No.

10:28.297 --> 10:29.664
Um...

10:29.699 --> 10:32.934
"I play doer."

10:32.968 --> 10:34.336
"A dire ploy."

10:34.370 --> 10:37.839
Guys, he's not looking so good.

10:37.873 --> 10:39.074
Wait a minute.

10:41.310 --> 10:42.677
"Play...

10:42.712 --> 10:44.294
or...

10:45.388 --> 10:46.958
die."

10:47.950 --> 10:49.517
Oh, man. This is so twisted.

10:49.552 --> 10:50.552
Oh, thank God.

10:50.586 --> 10:52.120
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

10:52.154 --> 10:54.756
Okay, ready?

10:56.125 --> 10:58.371
Whoa. What did you do to him?

10:59.662 --> 11:01.996
Nothing. I just put...

11:08.137 --> 11:09.704
It says it's poison.

11:09.739 --> 11:10.705
What?

11:10.740 --> 11:12.640
That's not...

11:12.675 --> 11:14.042
"salvation lies within."

11:14.076 --> 11:15.882
sa... lies.

11:16.436 --> 11:19.080
It was a trick.

11:19.115 --> 11:20.415
Okay, okay.

11:20.449 --> 11:23.138
Just open up his collar
so he can breathe.

11:24.420 --> 11:26.403
What is that?

11:27.062 --> 11:29.090
So what the hell are
we supposed to do now?

11:31.293 --> 11:33.157
I don't know.

11:35.031 --> 11:37.115
S08E12
The Blame Game

11:37.194 --> 11:40.568
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

11:43.056 --> 11:44.652
You were right.

11:44.790 --> 11:47.383
Whoever's behind this
isn't gonna kill us.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.260
He wants us to kill each other.

11:49.295 --> 11:53.698
I... There's another clue right here.

11:53.732 --> 11:54.899
"Time has run out.

11:54.934 --> 11:56.167
" 2-will cure.

11:56.201 --> 11:57.569
1-will kill."

11:57.603 --> 11:58.603
Okay, so that has to mean

11:58.637 --> 12:00.371
that there's a-an antidote
around here somewhere.

12:00.406 --> 12:02.106
Look around. Guys, look around.
Look around.

12:02.141 --> 12:02.907
What are we looking for?

12:02.942 --> 12:03.775
Something around here.

12:03.809 --> 12:06.611
"2-will cure"... What does that mean?

12:06.645 --> 12:07.845
Is it another injector?

12:07.880 --> 12:08.880
"1-will kill..."

12:08.914 --> 12:09.881
Is it a needle?

12:09.915 --> 12:13.500
Hey, guys, found something.

12:14.529 --> 12:16.688
"2-will cure."

12:16.722 --> 12:18.256
Hang in there, buddy.

12:18.290 --> 12:19.557
This is number 2.

12:19.592 --> 12:20.592
We just got to give him number 2.

12:20.626 --> 12:21.726
Wait, wait, no, wait, wait.

12:21.760 --> 12:22.493
Something's not right.

12:22.528 --> 12:24.762
Um, it's too easy, too, uh...

12:24.797 --> 12:25.630
But that's what the clue said.

12:25.664 --> 12:26.698
"2-will cure."

12:26.732 --> 12:27.665
What if that means

12:27.700 --> 12:30.268
a combination of two
vials makes the antidote?

12:30.302 --> 12:31.502
What are you talking about?

12:31.537 --> 12:34.973
Well, clearly we can't take
any of these clues for granted.

12:35.007 --> 12:37.041
"Time has run out"...
What does that mean?

12:38.644 --> 12:40.445
Okay, the clock...

12:40.479 --> 12:42.614
That clock has stopped.

12:42.648 --> 12:44.582
Which is "time has run out,"

12:44.617 --> 12:46.818
and the hands are at 1:00 and 3:00,

12:46.852 --> 12:50.822
so what if the antidote...

12:51.427 --> 12:54.726
1 and 3 vials combined.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.387
Oh, man...

12:58.097 --> 12:59.597
I don't know.

13:00.499 --> 13:02.767
Whoa, whoa.

13:02.801 --> 13:04.267
You sure about this?

13:13.846 --> 13:16.114
Oh, thank God.

13:16.148 --> 13:17.615
You all right?

13:17.650 --> 13:19.183
Just breathe.

13:19.218 --> 13:20.811
Breathe.

13:25.658 --> 13:27.759
Okay. Why the hell am I here?

13:27.793 --> 13:28.960
Well, Mr. Buckley,

13:28.994 --> 13:31.362
we understand that you had
some issues with Emma Matthews.

13:31.397 --> 13:32.697
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:32.731 --> 13:33.598
I liked Emma.

13:33.632 --> 13:34.966
It's a real shame what happened to her.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.868
Yeah, we're sure you're heartbroken,

13:36.902 --> 13:38.536
especially after she supposedly lied

13:38.570 --> 13:40.705
and beat you out of that
big promotion at work.

13:40.739 --> 13:42.507
And now that Emma's dead,

13:42.541 --> 13:44.375
that new job is yours for the taking.

13:44.410 --> 13:45.443
Whoa. Hold on.

13:45.477 --> 13:47.189
I may not be shedding
tears over Emma's demise,

13:47.255 --> 13:48.719
but I didn't kill her.

13:48.878 --> 13:52.617
You own a white Ram 350 van,
don't you, Mr. Buckley?

13:52.651 --> 13:53.451
Yeah. So?

13:53.485 --> 13:54.819
So a van matching that description

13:54.853 --> 13:56.120
was seen outside Emma's place

13:56.155 --> 13:57.555
during the time she was murdered.

13:57.589 --> 14:00.525
Where were you between
9:00 and 11:00 last night?

14:00.559 --> 14:02.763
At O'Malley's Pub in Brooklyn.

14:02.868 --> 14:04.696
And my van was parked right out front.

14:04.730 --> 14:05.963
Ask anyone there.

14:05.998 --> 14:06.597
We will.

14:06.632 --> 14:08.566
And it better check out.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.468
And just so you guys know,

14:10.502 --> 14:12.704
Emma did lie about me
to get that promotion.

14:12.738 --> 14:14.205
That chick lied all the time.

14:14.239 --> 14:15.417
What are you talking about?

14:15.522 --> 14:17.709
Just yesterday I caught
her in the edit bay

14:17.743 --> 14:19.243
digitizing old VHS tapes.

14:19.278 --> 14:20.845
Emma said it was proof for a story,

14:20.879 --> 14:22.880
but I know all the stories
she was working on,

14:22.915 --> 14:25.249
and those videos had nothing
to do with any of them.

14:25.284 --> 14:26.684
Wait, didn't Emma's co-worker

14:26.719 --> 14:28.352
say she just stumbled
on some sort of proof?

14:29.060 --> 14:30.922
Buckley, what was on those tapes?

14:30.956 --> 14:32.924
They were weird home
videos of a couple of kids

14:32.958 --> 14:35.059
sitting around wearing
these strange medallions.

14:35.094 --> 14:36.427
Strange how?

14:36.462 --> 14:37.195
I don't know.

14:37.229 --> 14:39.230
They... They had round symbols.

14:39.264 --> 14:41.184
Did they look anything like this?

14:42.968 --> 14:44.669
Yeah. Exactly like that.

14:44.703 --> 14:47.772
Are there copies of these
VHS tapes she was digitizing?

14:47.806 --> 14:50.908
Yeah. The system automatically
archives the raw footage

14:50.943 --> 14:52.521
to the server for backup.

14:53.946 --> 14:55.413
How you feeling?

14:55.447 --> 14:57.014
Better. Thanks for saving me.

14:57.049 --> 14:57.849
Oh.

14:57.883 --> 14:59.617
Hey, I don't even know your name.

14:59.651 --> 15:01.267
That's right.
We haven't done proper introductions.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.193
- I'm Rick.
- Todd.

15:03.299 --> 15:04.368
Yeah, my name's Simon.

15:04.407 --> 15:05.199
Judah.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.258
Well, gentlemen,

15:07.292 --> 15:08.888
um, clearly we were all
brought here for a reason.

15:08.961 --> 15:12.664
Maybe if we can figure out what it is,
it'll be our way out.

15:12.698 --> 15:13.865
Okay. How do we do that?

15:13.899 --> 15:16.267
Well, we all must have some sort
of connection to each other.

15:16.302 --> 15:17.469
Yeah, but I've never seen

15:17.503 --> 15:18.736
any of you guys in my life, ever.

15:18.771 --> 15:21.239
Right, but it may be some connection

15:21.273 --> 15:22.841
we're not yet aware of.

15:22.875 --> 15:25.510
Um, I'm a mystery writer.
What do you guys do for a living?

15:25.544 --> 15:27.479
I'm a third-grade teacher.

15:27.513 --> 15:28.346
I'm a minister.

15:28.380 --> 15:30.315
- I own a boxing gym.
- Okay. All right.

15:30.349 --> 15:33.151
No connection there, but,
uh, where are you from?

15:33.185 --> 15:34.586
I'm born and raised in New York City.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.154
Hey, mystery writer,
no one cares why we're here.

15:36.188 --> 15:37.322
We only care about getting out.

15:37.356 --> 15:38.156
I'm with him.

15:38.190 --> 15:38.844
Me too.

15:38.883 --> 15:42.160
There's got to be something
in here we can use to escape.

15:42.194 --> 15:44.362
You know what, Judah,

15:44.396 --> 15:45.830
the last time we broke something,

15:45.865 --> 15:46.798
Todd nearly died.

15:46.832 --> 15:49.100
Hey, pal,
I'm not the one who injected him

15:49.134 --> 15:50.101
with poison, okay?

15:50.135 --> 15:51.603
That's exactly my point.

15:51.637 --> 15:52.637
Rummaging around

15:52.671 --> 15:55.284
may inadvertently activate
another deadly trap.

16:02.147 --> 16:03.548
- We got to do something.
- Agreed.

16:03.582 --> 16:05.683
So let's be smart about it.

16:05.718 --> 16:08.286
Um, the cryptex...

16:08.320 --> 16:10.121
I-It led us to the poison,

16:10.155 --> 16:12.123
and the poison led us to the antidote.

16:12.157 --> 16:14.359
Yeah,
but there was no clue on the antidote.

16:15.661 --> 16:18.730
The clock was part of that solution.

16:18.764 --> 16:19.898
Maybe...

16:19.932 --> 16:23.101
it holds the next clue.

16:28.040 --> 16:30.008
"The key will release you."

16:30.042 --> 16:32.043
But what key?

16:34.513 --> 16:36.848
Alexis, where is your father?

16:36.882 --> 16:38.383
He's not with you?

16:38.417 --> 16:41.219
If he were,
would I be asking you where he is?

16:41.253 --> 16:42.420
Meow.

16:42.454 --> 16:43.755
Okay, sorry, sorry.

16:43.789 --> 16:44.789
I don't mean to get so bitchy.

16:44.823 --> 16:47.492
It's just that your father
blew off that meeting

16:47.526 --> 16:48.927
I set up with potential clients.

16:48.961 --> 16:50.128
He had an impromptu get-together

16:50.162 --> 16:52.163
this morning with Stephen
King maybe he's still there.

16:52.197 --> 16:53.898
- Do you have King's number?
- No.

16:53.933 --> 16:55.733
But his assistant called my Dad's cell,

16:55.768 --> 16:57.268
which is linked to the office computer.

16:57.303 --> 16:59.938
Okay, here's his call log.

16:59.972 --> 17:01.906
Got it.

17:06.111 --> 17:08.012
We're sorry,
you have reached a number...

17:08.047 --> 17:09.681
It's disconnected.

17:09.714 --> 17:12.150
I must have misdialed.

17:15.421 --> 17:17.622
We're sorry,
you have reached a number...

17:17.656 --> 17:18.656
Something's wrong.

17:18.691 --> 17:20.925
Yeah,
there's a new tweet from Stephen King...

17:20.960 --> 17:23.928
"Watch me live on Australia's
'7PM Project' in 20 minutes."

17:23.963 --> 17:27.065
If Stephen King is in Australia...

17:27.098 --> 17:28.933
where's my Dad?

17:28.968 --> 17:31.402
"The key will release you,"
but what key?

17:31.437 --> 17:32.537
Maybe it's a metaphor.

17:32.571 --> 17:33.738
Maybe you're an idiot.

17:33.772 --> 17:35.607
Now, will you please shut up
so the grown-ups can think?

17:35.641 --> 17:37.375
Guys,
the bickering is not gonna help us.

17:38.978 --> 17:40.478
Maybe there's something in this room

17:40.512 --> 17:41.412
that's shaped like this keyhole.

17:41.447 --> 17:44.682
Yeah,
I know I've seen that shape before.

17:51.957 --> 17:53.591
Boys, we're getting out of here.

18:01.333 --> 18:03.735
Oh, come on.

18:13.278 --> 18:16.280
"The last one standing will be freed."

18:19.218 --> 18:22.387
Three bullets, four of us.

18:26.225 --> 18:27.592
So, what?

18:27.626 --> 18:29.661
Whoever kills the others goes free?

18:34.199 --> 18:35.800
Give me the gun, Rick.

18:35.834 --> 18:37.602
No, no, no. I want the gun!

18:37.636 --> 18:40.371
Both of you, stop!

18:40.406 --> 18:42.607
Stop it.

18:42.641 --> 18:44.375
If you don't, whoever's behind
this wins, don't you see?

18:44.410 --> 18:46.210
Don't you see we're powerless in here?

18:46.245 --> 18:48.680
No, we're not.

18:48.714 --> 18:51.549
We have the power not to play.

18:51.583 --> 18:52.650
You hear that?

18:52.685 --> 18:56.148
We're not gonna play your sick,
little game anymore.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.689
You lose.

19:03.829 --> 19:06.755
It's another room.

19:06.781 --> 19:08.866
It's identical to this one.

19:10.198 --> 19:11.135
Meadow.

19:11.170 --> 19:13.615
What's my wife doing in there?

19:14.006 --> 19:15.840
That's my girlfriend, Patty.

19:20.950 --> 19:22.599
Beckett.

19:25.505 --> 19:26.539
It's exactly the same.

19:26.573 --> 19:28.274
Everything's the same.

19:28.813 --> 19:29.855
Castle?

19:29.934 --> 19:31.280
Do you hear me?

19:31.491 --> 19:32.517
Castle?

19:32.781 --> 19:34.430
Castle?

19:36.282 --> 19:38.083
That was my husband, Simon.

19:38.117 --> 19:39.384
And my boyfriend.

19:39.418 --> 19:41.920
Which explains the text that they used
to lure us here.

19:41.954 --> 19:43.655
They must have been abducted first

19:43.689 --> 19:45.557
and then their phones
were used to text us.

19:45.591 --> 19:46.792
But why?

19:46.826 --> 19:48.660
More importantly, who's that fourth man?

19:48.694 --> 19:49.561
What?

19:49.595 --> 19:52.330
Yeah,
there were four guys on that screen

19:52.365 --> 19:54.065
but only three of us.

19:54.509 --> 19:56.886
What happened to the woman
that was supposed to be in that chair?

19:59.772 --> 20:01.306
What is that on your neck?

20:01.340 --> 20:02.107
What?

20:04.377 --> 20:06.444
What is it?

20:08.815 --> 20:09.948
You have one, too.

20:09.982 --> 20:11.413
What about me?

20:11.983 --> 20:12.951
No.

20:12.985 --> 20:14.319
Well,
is that a good thing or a bad thing?

20:14.353 --> 20:15.320
I don't know,

20:15.354 --> 20:16.955
but the important thing
here is to stay calm.

20:16.989 --> 20:18.123
Screw calm!

20:18.157 --> 20:20.859
I say we break that glass
and hack our way out of here.

20:20.893 --> 20:23.161
No, that's not a good idea. Tough.

20:23.196 --> 20:25.163
If this isn't an emergency,
I don't know what is.

20:25.198 --> 20:27.365
Look, whoever is behind
this isn't stupid enough

20:27.400 --> 20:29.267
to leave something that
we can use to go free,

20:29.302 --> 20:31.102
which means that's a trap.

20:32.371 --> 20:36.444
Now let's just finish this
puzzle and see what happens.

20:37.243 --> 20:38.176
Fine.

20:38.524 --> 20:40.478
Knock yourself out.

20:46.152 --> 20:48.753
Something about this feels familiar.

20:49.671 --> 20:50.555
What do you mean?

20:50.590 --> 20:53.692
Identical rooms, the tasks...

20:53.726 --> 20:55.227
In grad school I read a case study

20:55.261 --> 20:57.963
that examines separation
anxiety in stressful situations.

20:57.997 --> 21:00.699
Well, this certainly is stressful.

21:00.733 --> 21:04.236
Oh. Thank God.

21:04.270 --> 21:05.170
What are you doing?

21:05.204 --> 21:07.372
Having a smoke. I think I've earned it.

21:07.406 --> 21:09.307
No!

21:09.342 --> 21:12.878
I told you...
you can't trust anything in this place.

21:12.912 --> 21:14.045
This could kill you.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.547
It's a cigarette.

21:15.581 --> 21:17.816
It's definitely gonna
kill me eventually.

21:22.088 --> 21:23.455
What the hell is that?

21:25.758 --> 21:27.225
It smells like peanuts.

21:29.428 --> 21:31.263
I'm allergic.

21:31.297 --> 21:33.298
Looks like Captain Beckett
just saved your life.

21:33.332 --> 21:36.434
So how about you start
being a team player?

21:36.469 --> 21:40.005
I need you to tell me
everything you can about this study.

21:47.947 --> 21:50.916
What the hell is my wife doing in here,
and yours?

21:50.950 --> 21:52.717
They must be leverage

21:52.752 --> 21:54.686
to make us follow the rules
or else they get hurt.

21:54.720 --> 21:56.288
Or maybe we're the leverage.

21:56.322 --> 21:57.088
And what about Todd?

21:57.123 --> 21:59.090
He didn't have anyone in that room.

21:59.125 --> 22:00.458
He's a priest. They're celibate.

22:00.493 --> 22:03.261
I'm a minister. The rules are different.

22:03.296 --> 22:06.231
So is there a Mrs. Minister
that's not in there?

22:06.265 --> 22:07.465
No, but that doesn't mean

22:07.500 --> 22:09.134
there aren't people I care about.

22:09.168 --> 22:10.302
And if something happened
to one of them...

22:10.336 --> 22:11.202
Look, we don't know enough

22:11.237 --> 22:13.138
for you to be worried about that, okay?

22:13.172 --> 22:15.240
Ah, hell, being locked in
this room with a loaded gun

22:15.274 --> 22:16.608
and instructions to kill one another

22:16.642 --> 22:17.943
is plenty to be worried about.

22:17.977 --> 22:19.311
We're not gonna do that.

22:19.345 --> 22:21.046
What we should be doing is figuring out

22:21.080 --> 22:22.447
why the hell we're here.

22:22.481 --> 22:24.149
And why are some of us
marked with this symbol

22:24.183 --> 22:25.083
and others aren't.

22:25.117 --> 22:27.252
Did you see the symbol
on any of the women?

22:27.286 --> 22:30.388
I saw something on Patricia's neck,
but I don't have one.

22:30.423 --> 22:31.489
And what about your wife?

22:31.524 --> 22:32.457
No.

22:32.491 --> 22:33.258
You sure?

22:33.292 --> 22:34.626
I didn't take my eyes off of her.

22:34.660 --> 22:36.394
So she doesn't have one but you do.

22:36.429 --> 22:38.563
Following that pattern,
Beckett must have one

22:38.597 --> 22:40.131
because I don't.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.844
Meaning what?

22:43.055 --> 22:46.004
Well, what if the people with the symbol

22:46.038 --> 22:49.541
are the important ones and
the rest of us are leverage?

22:56.382 --> 22:58.049
There he is.

23:09.528 --> 23:11.463
What's he doing in there?

23:13.399 --> 23:16.768
Wait, what's going on with that van?

23:27.580 --> 23:29.581
Uh, what the hell just happened?

23:32.018 --> 23:34.352
Was that my dad?

23:34.387 --> 23:36.354
So, Buckley sent over those tapes

23:36.389 --> 23:38.223
that Emma was digitizing.

23:38.257 --> 23:39.491
And?

23:39.525 --> 23:40.558
Well, he's right.

23:40.593 --> 23:42.627
It's, uh, weird.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.502
What are they doing?

23:50.536 --> 23:53.353
Solving puzzles. For hours.

23:55.305 --> 23:59.044
And they're wearing the symbol,
just like Buckley said.

23:59.078 --> 24:01.846
Could that little girl be Emma?

24:01.881 --> 24:03.214
It's possible.

24:03.249 --> 24:04.816
Based on clothing and picture quality,

24:04.850 --> 24:07.619
the lab thinks that the tape
is at least 20 years old.

24:08.999 --> 24:12.157
If it is Emma,
then who's that little boy

24:12.191 --> 24:15.727
and what do these videos
have to do with her murder?

24:15.761 --> 24:17.429
I'm scared.

24:17.463 --> 24:20.098
I don't want to play this game anymore.

24:20.132 --> 24:23.334
Please, let me out.

24:28.741 --> 24:29.707
Yo.

24:29.742 --> 24:32.110
Dad's missing and we can't
reach Beckett's cell.

24:32.144 --> 24:33.711
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.

24:35.081 --> 24:36.948
Beckett's at a forensics conference,
Alexis.

24:36.982 --> 24:38.049
No. She never showed.

24:38.084 --> 24:39.884
Rick was lured into an
empty building this morning.

24:39.919 --> 24:41.719
I hacked a nearby street
camera and got footage

24:41.754 --> 24:44.113
of a white van fleeing the scene.

24:44.166 --> 24:46.791
Neighbors saw a white van
in front of Emma's building.

24:46.870 --> 24:48.093
Who's Emma?

24:50.096 --> 24:51.796
A murder victim.

24:51.831 --> 24:53.231
We think her killer

24:53.265 --> 24:55.600
might have been have been
driving a rusty white van.

25:01.607 --> 25:04.067
If the clue is right,
this must be the key.

25:04.107 --> 25:06.711
I take back every bad thing
I've been thinking about you.

25:06.745 --> 25:09.514
Yeah, well, thank you.

25:12.089 --> 25:14.292
Just another mind game.

25:15.588 --> 25:18.123
"The last one standing will be freed."

25:29.535 --> 25:30.768
Two bullets.

25:30.803 --> 25:33.571
And three of us.

25:33.606 --> 25:37.675
Clearly our captor's trying
to turn us against each other.

25:37.710 --> 25:40.011
What kind of sick new test is this?

25:40.045 --> 25:43.982
I don't know,
but it seems a little unsophisticated.

25:44.016 --> 25:45.617
Meadow!

25:45.651 --> 25:46.484
What are you doing?

25:46.519 --> 25:48.453
It's called survival of the fittest.

25:55.294 --> 25:56.961
Just more concrete.

25:56.996 --> 25:58.530
Which falls under the
"to be expected" column.

26:03.669 --> 26:04.769
Oh, no.

26:13.412 --> 26:14.946
Sorry, boys.

26:14.980 --> 26:16.548
My wife's got the right idea.

26:22.121 --> 26:25.090
Meadow, you don't have to do this.

26:25.124 --> 26:26.524
Look, it's nothing personal.

26:26.559 --> 26:27.692
Give me the gun, Meadow.

26:27.727 --> 26:29.794
Shooting us isn't gonna get
you out of here any faster.

26:29.829 --> 26:31.830
I'm sorry, but it's you or me.

26:33.466 --> 26:34.399
Aah!

26:39.238 --> 26:41.272
Simon...

26:41.307 --> 26:44.042
shooting us is not gonna
get that door open.

26:44.076 --> 26:45.477
You don't know that.

26:45.511 --> 26:47.645
The note says only one will survive.

26:47.680 --> 26:49.481
I need to make sure it's me.

26:52.184 --> 26:53.785
Don't go down this path.

26:56.055 --> 26:58.323
Sorry, preacher.

27:08.334 --> 27:09.801
He's dead.

27:19.412 --> 27:21.346
The barrel is sealed.

27:21.380 --> 27:23.687
The gun's as rigged as this room.

27:28.819 --> 27:31.320
This will have to do
until I get you into real handcuffs.

27:31.491 --> 27:32.558
Come on.

27:32.588 --> 27:34.226
Can't we work something out?

27:34.261 --> 27:35.761
You tried to kill us.

27:35.796 --> 27:37.396
If she hadn't taken the bullets out,

27:37.431 --> 27:38.397
you would have.

27:38.432 --> 27:39.398
I wasn't myself.

27:39.433 --> 27:42.334
It was fight or flight,
pure animal instinct.

27:47.107 --> 27:49.475
No. Simon.

27:59.858 --> 28:00.619
I'm so sorry.

28:00.654 --> 28:01.721
Save it.

28:01.755 --> 28:03.815
Your husband killed him.

28:04.424 --> 28:05.624
We don't know that.

28:05.659 --> 28:07.710
Get away from me.

28:13.166 --> 28:14.467
What are we gonna do?

28:14.501 --> 28:16.102
This is all a game to our captor.

28:16.136 --> 28:18.237
We're being manipulated.

28:20.774 --> 28:23.309
We're gonna change the rules.

28:23.343 --> 28:25.111
Just give me a call
whenever you hear something.

28:25.145 --> 28:27.313
Hey. I got something.

28:27.347 --> 28:28.080
Vikram scrubbed the footage.

28:28.115 --> 28:29.749
He found the name "Northcliff"

28:29.783 --> 28:31.584
written at the bottom
of one of the puzzles.

28:31.618 --> 28:32.985
Now, when Emma was a teenager,

28:33.019 --> 28:34.954
she walked dogs for a
pair of psychiatrists...

28:34.988 --> 28:37.442
Geoffrey and Samantha Northcliff.

28:39.326 --> 28:40.459
This is good.

28:40.494 --> 28:41.527
Yeah, and it gets better.

28:41.561 --> 28:44.430
There was a break-in at the Northcliffs'
apartment

28:44.464 --> 28:46.065
the night before Emma was murdered.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.233
According to the police report,

28:47.267 --> 28:49.268
only personal property was taken.

28:49.302 --> 28:50.756
The VHS tapes.

28:50.830 --> 28:52.304
She must have broken in to steal them.

28:52.339 --> 28:53.005
But why?

28:53.039 --> 28:54.273
Let's ask the Northcliffs.

28:54.307 --> 28:55.341
I can't find them.

28:55.375 --> 28:57.810
But I've got their secretary
in the box right now.

28:57.844 --> 28:59.111
All right.

28:59.146 --> 29:01.447
So much tragedy.

29:01.481 --> 29:04.517
I hadn't seen Emma since
she was a teenager.

29:04.551 --> 29:08.320
And then I ran into her
last week at Fay's funeral.

29:08.355 --> 29:09.421
Whose funeral?

29:09.456 --> 29:10.823
Fay Northcliff...

29:10.857 --> 29:12.258
Geoffrey and Samantha's daughter.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.359
What happened to her?

29:13.393 --> 29:15.027
She hung herself.

29:15.061 --> 29:16.829
The poor girl.

29:17.346 --> 29:19.031
Did she have any siblings?

29:19.065 --> 29:21.200
Yes. A twin brother, Brandon.

29:21.234 --> 29:23.515
And are these the twins, right here?

29:26.333 --> 29:27.515
Yes.

29:28.341 --> 29:29.975
25 years ago, the Northcliffs

29:30.010 --> 29:31.710
did groundbreaking research

29:31.745 --> 29:33.379
on separation anxiety in children.

29:33.413 --> 29:35.815
But there were rumors
of unethical behavior.

29:35.849 --> 29:37.183
And they were involved in some

29:37.217 --> 29:39.285
pretty fringe behavioral science.

29:39.319 --> 29:40.186
Did the Northcliffs

29:40.220 --> 29:42.454
use their own children as test subjects?

29:42.489 --> 29:44.584
I wouldn't know anything about that.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.060
Emma's dead, Rose.

29:48.094 --> 29:49.862
And if she broke into the Northcliffs'
apartment

29:49.896 --> 29:50.729
to steal those tapes,

29:50.764 --> 29:52.231
then she was planning to expose them.

29:52.265 --> 29:54.333
It's possible that the Northcliffs

29:54.367 --> 29:55.868
killed her to keep that secret.

29:55.902 --> 29:57.903
And if you don't want to
be charged as an accessory,

29:57.938 --> 30:00.579
then you better come clean right now.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.343
You have to believe me.

30:04.377 --> 30:06.478
I didn't know the experiments

30:06.513 --> 30:09.348
were doing harm to those children.

30:10.345 --> 30:12.718
Time has proven otherwise.

30:12.752 --> 30:16.422
Brandon fled the country,
became a recluse.

30:16.456 --> 30:19.458
Poor Fay...
you know what happened to her.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.330
Do you have any idea where the
Northcliffs might be right now?

30:24.364 --> 30:25.197
No.

30:25.232 --> 30:27.666
I haven't seen them since yesterday.

30:27.701 --> 30:30.202
I swear to you.

30:30.636 --> 30:32.771
Guys.

30:32.806 --> 30:33.772
Hayley ID'd the van.

30:33.807 --> 30:35.441
It's registered to a
professional corporation

30:35.475 --> 30:37.076
owned by somebody named
Geoffrey Northcliff.

30:37.110 --> 30:39.278
He and his wife are our prime suspects.

30:39.312 --> 30:40.946
Did you get an address
off the registration?

30:40.981 --> 30:42.848
Yes, it's a secluded
property outside Hartsdale.

30:42.883 --> 30:44.950
That could be where they're
holding Castle and Beckett.

30:44.985 --> 30:46.886
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

30:52.158 --> 30:54.460
This is not gonna happen.

30:54.494 --> 30:55.527
We need to work smarter.

30:55.562 --> 30:56.595
How?

30:56.630 --> 30:58.364
That door's the only way out.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.432
If we could find something
we can use as a pry bar,

31:00.467 --> 31:02.301
we can get it between
lock and the frame,

31:02.335 --> 31:03.535
we might be able to pop it open.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.937
Yeah, okay.

31:04.971 --> 31:07.172
All right.

31:12.345 --> 31:15.147
So, the chemicals in there are explosive.

31:15.181 --> 31:18.384
It just needs a catalyst to set it off.

31:21.187 --> 31:24.390
Great.

31:24.424 --> 31:27.826
Fuse.

31:27.861 --> 31:29.295
There you go.

31:29.329 --> 31:31.430
Thanks. Perfect.

31:38.538 --> 31:40.639
I've always loved the
smell of this stuff.

31:40.674 --> 31:42.622
Okay.

31:43.543 --> 31:45.221
You two better hide.

32:02.700 --> 32:03.700
What was that?

32:03.735 --> 32:06.169
I don't know,
but we need to get out of here now.

32:06.204 --> 32:07.793
Okay.

32:14.178 --> 32:16.346
Just stay close.

32:17.548 --> 32:18.993
This could be another trap.

32:34.499 --> 32:36.333
Get back.

32:37.702 --> 32:39.856
There's someone there. Stay close, okay?

32:56.988 --> 32:58.321
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't shoot.

32:58.356 --> 33:00.056
It's rigged to kill the shooter.

33:00.091 --> 33:01.458
That's how Simon died.

33:07.498 --> 33:08.632
Thank God you're okay.

33:08.666 --> 33:10.066
Patricia.

33:10.101 --> 33:10.867
You okay?

33:10.902 --> 33:12.035
Yeah. Good.

33:12.069 --> 33:13.069
We should keep moving.

33:13.104 --> 33:14.359
He's right.

33:21.412 --> 33:22.546
It could be a trap!

33:22.580 --> 33:23.547
No, wait, wait.

33:23.581 --> 33:24.548
It's fine!

33:24.582 --> 33:25.849
W-We can get out.

33:25.883 --> 33:27.317
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

33:27.351 --> 33:28.985
About damn time.

33:29.020 --> 33:30.654
Oh, we're free!

33:30.688 --> 33:31.488
No!

33:35.359 --> 33:36.793
- No!
- We're locked in.

33:47.338 --> 33:48.338
Whatever they're for,

33:48.373 --> 33:50.440
we got less than five
minutes to figure it out.

33:50.475 --> 33:53.710
It started counting down as
soon as the doors closed.

33:53.745 --> 33:55.646
Okay, clearly this room
is our captor's endgame.

33:55.680 --> 33:58.073
He wanted us to end up here.

33:58.349 --> 34:00.684
Why? What does he want from us?

34:01.786 --> 34:04.054
Is that another clue?

34:04.088 --> 34:05.289
Last piece of the puzzle...

34:05.323 --> 34:06.089
"Of those who remain,

34:06.124 --> 34:07.824
only your better half can survive."

34:07.859 --> 34:09.426
What the hell does that mean?

34:09.460 --> 34:12.129
There are six of us
left and three levers.

34:12.163 --> 34:14.297
He wants to separate the couples,

34:14.331 --> 34:16.166
make us choose who goes free.

34:16.201 --> 34:18.569
And who stays behind to pull the levers.

34:18.603 --> 34:20.504
I assume all three need
to be pulled at once

34:20.538 --> 34:21.405
to open the door.

34:21.438 --> 34:23.072
Unless that's what he wants us to think.

34:23.107 --> 34:24.942
These levers could just
as easily blow this room.

34:24.976 --> 34:26.376
How are we supposed to know?

34:29.193 --> 34:30.697
We have to have faith.

34:35.286 --> 34:36.820
W-Wait, wait!

34:41.726 --> 34:44.364
See? Faith.

34:45.129 --> 34:46.777
Now, who's staying in here with me?

34:49.400 --> 34:50.868
State police!

34:54.172 --> 34:55.706
We got two hostages!

34:55.739 --> 34:56.572
It's the Northcliffs.

34:56.608 --> 34:59.209
- Bedroom's clear!
- Kitchen's clear!

34:59.244 --> 35:01.831
What the hell is this?

35:04.048 --> 35:05.082
Dad?

35:07.752 --> 35:10.053
Where are they?

35:10.088 --> 35:13.357
There's a building hidden in the
trees at the bottom of the hill.

35:13.391 --> 35:15.158
Who's behind this? Who left you here?

35:15.193 --> 35:17.060
Our son, Brandon.

35:17.095 --> 35:18.395
We're out of time.

35:18.429 --> 35:19.997
You need to choose which ones of you

35:20.031 --> 35:21.646
are staying in here with me.

35:30.408 --> 35:31.208
I'll stay.

35:31.242 --> 35:32.309
Castle.

35:37.048 --> 35:37.948
Fine.

35:37.982 --> 35:40.050
But I'm not letting you stay here alone.

35:44.422 --> 35:46.390
Patricia, you leave with the others.

35:46.424 --> 35:47.724
The instructions say "your better half."

35:47.759 --> 35:49.359
If you both stay,
that's breaking the rules.

35:49.394 --> 35:50.294
Screw the rules!

35:50.328 --> 35:51.361
There could be
consequences for all of us!

35:51.396 --> 35:53.463
There's consequences when
we follow the rules, too.

35:55.466 --> 35:56.744
Come on.

36:01.272 --> 36:02.372
Thank you!

36:02.407 --> 36:04.408
We'll send help.

36:09.280 --> 36:11.381
So, what now?

36:24.932 --> 36:25.765
I'm sorry.

36:25.799 --> 36:27.400
I thought we could run out the door.

36:27.434 --> 36:29.168
Really?

36:29.203 --> 36:31.237
So it's not because we broke your rules?

36:31.962 --> 36:34.806
Well, he did say
that there would be consequences.

36:37.498 --> 36:38.644
We know it's you.

36:41.215 --> 36:42.381
Damn it.

36:45.119 --> 36:46.886
Don't!

36:49.623 --> 36:51.343
What gave me away?

36:51.606 --> 36:53.926
When you ran into this room,

36:53.961 --> 36:56.896
even though we all suspected
it would be booby-trapped.

36:57.751 --> 36:58.698
And then when you pulled that lever,

36:58.732 --> 37:00.666
you didn't even hesitate.

37:00.701 --> 37:01.934
Same way you didn't hesitate

37:01.969 --> 37:04.070
when Simon pulled the trigger.

37:04.104 --> 37:05.037
You weren't afraid,

37:05.072 --> 37:07.673
and not because you're a
"minister" with faith,

37:07.708 --> 37:10.009
but because you are a
mastermind with the knowledge

37:10.043 --> 37:12.445
that the gun was rigged
to fire backwards.

37:12.479 --> 37:13.913
Not like this one.

37:20.154 --> 37:22.788
Let's finish the experiment.

37:22.823 --> 37:24.957
One of you has to die.
Those are the rules.

37:24.992 --> 37:25.925
Why are you doing this?

37:25.959 --> 37:27.627
That's the same question
I asked my parents

37:27.661 --> 37:29.528
when they would rip me
away from my twin sister...

37:29.621 --> 37:32.932
Testing us over and over, day after day.

37:32.966 --> 37:35.101
Look, no one should be treated

37:35.135 --> 37:36.369
the way you and your sister were.

37:36.403 --> 37:38.771
- Let us help you.
- Help me? You?

37:38.805 --> 37:40.206
Why?

37:40.240 --> 37:42.074
'Cause you're a cop?

37:42.109 --> 37:44.890
I talked to cop once, when I was a kid.

37:45.511 --> 37:46.552
You know what happened?

37:46.618 --> 37:48.447
He sent over two officers
from the 12th Precinct,

37:48.482 --> 37:50.284
your precinct.

37:50.496 --> 37:53.920
They talked to my parents
for five minutes, then walked away!

37:53.954 --> 37:56.489
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as my sister was.

37:56.523 --> 38:00.226
My parents ordered more isolation,
more tests.

38:00.260 --> 38:04.564
So you're holding Beckett responsible?

38:04.598 --> 38:07.333
She was a child when that happened.

38:07.367 --> 38:09.068
Why are you punishing her?

38:09.102 --> 38:11.971
This isn't punishment. This is science.

38:12.005 --> 38:14.140
Patricia is a psychiatrist
on the Board of Education.

38:14.174 --> 38:16.142
Did someone there let
you and your sister down?

38:16.176 --> 38:19.579
Kate, everyone let us down.

38:19.613 --> 38:20.646
So we're all surrogates

38:20.681 --> 38:22.748
for people that weren't
able to protect you two.

38:22.783 --> 38:25.751
But you were careful to choose
people who love each other,

38:25.786 --> 38:29.088
because you loved your sister.

38:29.122 --> 38:30.489
She was your soulmate.

38:30.524 --> 38:33.092
Now one of you has to feel what I feel.

38:33.126 --> 38:34.427
Now, why did you choose Emma?

38:34.461 --> 38:36.095
She wanted to expose my parents!

38:36.129 --> 38:37.930
That's not enough...

38:37.965 --> 38:39.932
Some video tapes of
some kids doing puzzles?

38:39.967 --> 38:42.595
That's nothing,
a blip in the news cycle.

38:43.122 --> 38:45.338
But one of you goes free,

38:45.372 --> 38:48.975
and tells how I killed ur
one true love and myself...

38:49.009 --> 38:52.712
Only then will the world
truly understand the monster

38:52.746 --> 38:54.981
my parents created.

38:55.015 --> 38:56.349
No more talking.

38:56.383 --> 38:58.384
Time to solve the final puzzle.

38:58.418 --> 38:59.986
Which one of you dies?

39:00.765 --> 39:02.888
I won't choose.

39:02.923 --> 39:03.956
Neither will I.

39:03.991 --> 39:06.959
Decide or I'll start maiming
you till someone does.

39:06.994 --> 39:08.661
Okay, okay.

39:09.228 --> 39:10.863
I'll choose.

39:12.232 --> 39:14.505
I-I'll decide.

39:15.002 --> 39:16.802
Good.

39:16.837 --> 39:18.701
Who dies, Rick?

39:20.374 --> 39:21.818
No one dies.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.332
Don't move.

39:34.054 --> 39:35.187
You guys okay?

39:35.222 --> 39:36.856
Yeah. Thanks for rescuing us.

39:36.890 --> 39:39.058
Yes, because clearly
you're helpless without us.

39:39.092 --> 39:40.128
How'd you guys even find us?

39:40.194 --> 39:43.262
Well, we had our best person on it.

39:45.097 --> 39:46.904
I can't leave you
alone for five minutes.

39:46.996 --> 39:48.801
Does this mean no hug?

39:59.046 --> 39:59.845
Hey.

39:59.880 --> 40:01.280
I'm heading out for a bit of fun.

40:01.315 --> 40:02.882
Want to come with?

40:02.916 --> 40:05.040
I'll pass. Thanks.

40:05.585 --> 40:07.085
How you doing?

40:16.754 --> 40:19.116
You worry a lot about your father.

40:22.069 --> 40:25.545
You would, too, if Richard Castle
was your dad.

40:25.940 --> 40:29.108
I mean, the guy's abducted,
like, what, twice a year?

40:29.142 --> 40:31.811
I think that's a tad above
the national average.

40:31.845 --> 40:33.145
Yet he always comes home.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.371
Do you know why that is?

40:34.502 --> 40:35.614
Yeah.

40:35.649 --> 40:37.149
He's really lucky.

40:37.184 --> 40:40.560
No. He's really good at what he does.

40:46.009 --> 40:47.293
Is he as good as you?

40:47.327 --> 40:48.828
Good heavens, no.

40:48.862 --> 40:50.329
Why would you ask such a thing?

40:50.364 --> 40:52.164
All right.
We're gonna get you dolled up,

40:52.199 --> 40:54.567
we are gonna go out to some clubs,

40:54.601 --> 40:56.936
we're gonna get into just a tiny,
little bit of trouble.

40:56.970 --> 40:59.071
Never hurt anyone. Come on.

41:06.947 --> 41:07.980
Thanks.

41:08.014 --> 41:09.014
You okay?

41:09.049 --> 41:11.183
Yeah, I was just thinking
about those little kids.

41:11.218 --> 41:12.775
I mean...

41:12.973 --> 41:15.836
a lot of people let them down.

41:16.890 --> 41:19.358
And although their parents
are finally being exposed,

41:19.393 --> 41:20.993
it's far too little, too late.

41:21.027 --> 41:21.927
Mm.

41:21.962 --> 41:23.429
This is not the day that I was expecting

41:23.574 --> 41:24.998
when I woke up this morning.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.370
Tell me about it.

41:26.568 --> 41:28.072
But at least it's ending well.

41:28.217 --> 41:29.405
Yeah.

41:33.261 --> 41:34.976
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

41:35.134 --> 41:38.907
I-I ju... I was really looking forward
to the prospect of collaborating

41:38.960 --> 41:41.018
with Stephen King, you know?

41:41.229 --> 41:43.498
Well, you know, Castle,
look on the bright side.

41:44.332 --> 41:45.822
When Stephen King
does call,

41:45.901 --> 41:48.395
at least you'll have
one hell of an icebreaker.
