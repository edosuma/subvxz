WEBVTT

00:25.550 --> 00:27.586
(sighs)
The egg was your innovation,

00:27.620 --> 00:29.326
I take it?
Best way to confirm

00:29.360 --> 00:30.657
the pate's been struck.

00:30.690 --> 00:33.329
No disputes
in the absence of judges.

00:35.460 --> 00:39.135
Beautiful city, New York.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.138
It's no London, though, is it?

00:41.170 --> 00:43.661
It's the American London.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.462
Still, you must miss it.

00:45.510 --> 00:47.273
I miss nothing.

00:47.310 --> 00:50.473
Pates being
the obvious exception.

00:50.510 --> 00:53.343
May I assume we're still
on for this evening?

00:53.380 --> 00:56.417
Diogenes, my restaurant. Dinner.

00:56.450 --> 00:59.089
You were a no—show
at the opening.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.849
Yes, well, I had a choice
to make, didn't I?

01:00.890 --> 01:02.482
Find the abductor
of a young girl,

01:02.530 --> 01:04.122
or choke down cuisine
In a room full of glts.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.525
Ileavein
a few days.

01:05.560 --> 01:08.120
You've been putting this off
for a week.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.819
Diogenes is my creation,
Sherlock.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.134
I'm proud of it.
You're my brother.

01:13.170 --> 01:16.298
And here was me thinking
that we could satisfy your itch

01:16.340 --> 01:18.558
for fraternal bonding using
the age-old tradition

01:18.610 --> 01:20.237
of two siblings
hitting each other.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.839
Very well.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.417
In the meantime...

01:42.430 --> 01:44.694
(sniffles)

01:44.730 --> 01:47.528
What's today's word?

01:47.570 --> 01:49.709
"Borborygmus."

01:49.740 --> 01:51.401
What's that mean?

01:51.440 --> 01:52.907
"The sound
of your stomach grumbling."

01:52.940 --> 01:54.476
Borborygmus.

01:54.510 --> 01:57.274
Some words we just don't need.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.885
(loud thudding)

02:07.690 --> 02:09.487
Did you hear that?

02:09.530 --> 02:10.781
What?

02:10.830 --> 02:12.354
I don't know.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.494
I guess it
was nothing.

02:18.970 --> 02:20.699
(engine starts)

02:40.520 --> 02:43.353
Lady saw the body on the roof
from an office window,

02:43.390 --> 02:44.755
called it in.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.496
Radio car pulled
the driver over.

02:46.530 --> 02:48.350
Looks like she
was stabbed

02:48.400 --> 02:50.561
before she fell,
just below the ribs.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.397
Yeah, kind of rules out suicide.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.964
Somebody came at her
with a knife,

02:54.000 --> 02:55.490
and then she went airborne.

02:55.540 --> 02:57.269
WATSON:
Do we know who she is?

02:57.310 --> 02:58.663
BELL:
Well, no I.D.

02:58.710 --> 03:00.268
No clue when she hit the truck.

03:00.310 --> 03:01.971
About the only thing
the driver could say for sure

03:02.010 --> 03:03.898
is that she wasn't there
when he started this morning.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.645
So, unless a missing
persons call comes in

03:05.680 --> 03:06.942
matching her description,

03:06.980 --> 03:08.470
I'm looking
at canvassing

03:08.520 --> 03:10.317
every stop
he's made today.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.818
Huh.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.861
Good news, Detective.

03:28.470 --> 03:30.506
Think I might be able
to narrow your search.

03:34.780 --> 03:39.911
Would you mind asking the driver
to join us for a moment?

03:39.950 --> 03:41.918
Sir?

03:43.590 --> 03:45.911
Would I be correct
In assuming

03:45.950 --> 03:48.555
that these numbers are used
to organize the parcels

03:48.590 --> 03:49.784
astheyTeloaded
for delivery?

03:49.830 --> 03:52.298
Yeah. Loading sets
me up in the morning

03:52.330 --> 03:53.752
with everything
in delivery order.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.290
Every stop, I
find the delivery

03:55.330 --> 03:56.820
by checking the
numbers on the shelf.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.826
Excellent.
So, you should have no trouble

03:58.870 --> 04:00.531
in telling us where you were

04:00.570 --> 04:02.800
when you delivered the box
which sat here.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.728
Sure. But why?

04:04.770 --> 04:07.876
If you just do
as he asks, please.

04:07.910 --> 04:10.299
(whispers)

04:10.350 --> 04:13.672
When our Jane Doe
hit the roof,

04:13.720 --> 04:17.315
the impact dislodged paint chips
from the ceiling,

04:17.350 --> 04:19.318
which, as you can see,
are currently dispersed

04:19.360 --> 04:20.713
around the shelves and floor.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.011
But notice

04:22.060 --> 04:23.482
said paint chips

04:23.530 --> 04:24.849
abruptly stop

04:24.890 --> 04:26.426
partway along this shelf.

04:26.460 --> 04:28.018
These spaces,

04:28.060 --> 04:29.596
the chips hit boxes
which were still here

04:29.630 --> 04:30.892
at the moment of impact.

04:30.930 --> 04:32.636
Boxes which our
accommodating

04:32.670 --> 04:35.036
but unobservant driver
has smce delivered.

04:35.070 --> 04:37.038
So, we need simply identify
the delivery

04:37.070 --> 04:39.868
immediately preceding the point
where the chips cease...

04:39.910 --> 04:42.003
And we'll know the truck's
location when the body fell.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.612
Closer than we started.

04:46.650 --> 04:48.709
Guess I'll start
ringing doorbells.

04:48.750 --> 04:53.380
I think we should start there--
the third balcony up.

04:53.420 --> 04:54.887
I mean, all the apartments
have the same trees

04:54.920 --> 04:56.387
on their terrace
except for that one.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.682
Maybe it got knocked over
when she fell.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.461
Well done, Watson.

05:16.710 --> 05:20.441
HOLMES:
Well, the stabbing
happened here, obviously.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.948
Miss Doe stumbled bacloNards
and over the balcony.

05:25.990 --> 05:28.811
BELL:
Hey, the super doesn't know
the girl's name.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.828
Said people pay
for their privacy here.

05:30.860 --> 05:33.021
Um, no cameras,

05:33.060 --> 05:34.755
no doorman, no questions.

05:34.800 --> 05:36.825
He gave me the management
company's contact info.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.519
Thought maybe
they could tell us.

05:40.940 --> 05:43.829
WATSON:
You were up early
this morning.

05:43.870 --> 05:45.838
You assume that I slept.

05:45.870 --> 05:48.577
Well, I heard you
and Mycroft up on the roof.

05:48.610 --> 05:49.838
I was worried he might wake you.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.438
The man may have lost
a few pounds,

05:51.480 --> 05:54.574
but he has all the grace
of a drunken mastodon.

05:54.620 --> 05:56.884
Well, I think it' nice...

05:56.920 --> 05:59.753
the two of you getting
to know each other again.

06:03.490 --> 06:05.958
Her name was
Haley Tyler.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.595
She was 26.
I take it

06:08.630 --> 06:10.495
the address on_ Miss
Tyler's driver's license

06:10.530 --> 06:12.395
is not this apartment.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.862
Yep, you're right.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.993
"Mineral Wells, Texas."

06:16.040 --> 06:19.009
Two pairs of designer
shoes, barely used.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.577
One older pair of the
bargain basement variety.

06:21.610 --> 06:23.077
The wear on all
three, however,

06:23.110 --> 06:25.101
indicates an identical
suplnatlon of the left heel,

06:25.150 --> 06:26.742
ruling out multiple owners.

06:26.780 --> 06:28.179
There are newer clothes

06:28.220 --> 06:30.609
bought at high-end boutiques
hanging in the closet.

06:30.650 --> 06:32.880
The older, more homey attire,
is stuffed into her luggage.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.911
Yes, Miss Tyler was
new to the big city.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.781
She was accustomed to
far less affluent means.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.627
It's unlikely she
could have afforded

06:39.660 --> 06:41.025
this little bauble herself.

06:41.060 --> 06:43.995
I humbly submit,
she was a kept woman.

06:44.030 --> 06:45.918
Well,

06:45.970 --> 06:47.767
if you're right,
you're not gonna believe

06:47.800 --> 06:49.438
who was keeping her.

06:49.470 --> 06:51.768
That phone you get along with
better than most people--

06:51.810 --> 06:53.801
the guy who owns this apartment
invented it,

06:53.840 --> 06:56.172
along with half the computers
in the country.

06:56.210 --> 06:58.144
WATSON:
Ian Gale.

06:58.180 --> 07:01.547
I just read his autobiography
last year.

07:01.580 --> 07:02.945
Impressive man.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.618
Are you kidding me?
He is an icon.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.515
I'm sure he puts his ear
buds in one at a time,

07:07.560 --> 07:08.686
just like the
rest of us.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.926
Detective Bell?

07:09.960 --> 07:11.655
That's right.

07:11.690 --> 07:14.193
You're not Ian Gale.

07:14.230 --> 07:16.790
No. I'm Alan Becker,
Mr. Gale's lawyer.

07:16.830 --> 07:18.525
Someone with a badge
shows up looking

07:18.570 --> 07:20.663
for Mr. Gale, you get me.

07:20.700 --> 07:24.534
Yes, I am aware
who Miss Tyler is.

07:24.570 --> 07:26.060
Was.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.771
If you'd like,

07:27.810 --> 07:30.938
my office can assist in
contacting next of kin.

07:30.980 --> 07:33.073
Thanks, but we've already
reached out to her mom.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.974
She's on her way
to New York as we speak.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.942
I'm not at liberty
to discuss the nature

07:36.990 --> 07:39.811
of Mr. Gale's relationship
with Miss Tyler,

07:39.860 --> 07:43.250
but I'm sure I can speak for Ian
and all of Galeforce

07:43.290 --> 07:47.693
in expressing our shock and
sadness at this horrible news.

07:47.730 --> 07:49.254
We'd like
to hear Mr. Gale express

07:49.300 --> 07:50.858
his shock and sadness himself.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.993
And we already have
a pretty good sense

07:53.040 --> 07:54.598
of the nature
of the relationship.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.063
HOLMES:
What we would like
to ask Mr. Gale is

07:57.110 --> 07:58.668
how the relationship ended.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.234
Lover's quarrel?

08:00.280 --> 08:02.805
Did Miss Tyler threaten
to go public? Tell his wife?

08:02.850 --> 08:05.171
Was she no longer satisfied
being the other woman?

08:05.210 --> 08:07.576
Mr. Gale is unavailable,

08:07.620 --> 08:10.589
and I can assure you, he had
nothing to do with her death.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.508
How would you know that
without asking him?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.209
He's in Kuala Lumpur.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.558
He has been for
over a month.

08:16.590 --> 08:20.856
Here.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.629
This was recorded
about 12 hours ago

08:22.670 --> 08:24.558
by a local Malaysian
news channel.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.534
He's there overseeing the plans

08:26.570 --> 08:28.231
for the new chip
assembly plant.

08:28.270 --> 08:30.864
BELL:
Should I bother asking
how long a flight is

08:30.910 --> 08:32.207
from New York
to Kuala Lumpur?

08:32.240 --> 08:34.003
It's about a day.

08:34.040 --> 08:35.871
Well, that is quite
a compelling alibi.

08:35.910 --> 08:37.241
Except the man in that video

08:37.280 --> 08:39.100
is not Ian Gale.
Excuse me?

08:39.150 --> 08:41.015
You've hired a stand-in,
a look-alike.

08:41.050 --> 08:42.915
Politicians and tyrants
have been doing it

08:42.950 --> 08:44.986
for as long
as there have been cameras,

08:45.020 --> 08:47.056
so, why shouldn't CEOs
join the club?

08:47.090 --> 08:48.887
A search for the make
and year of the SUV

08:48.920 --> 08:50.922
in that video yields
a vehicle height

08:50.960 --> 08:52.279
of precisely six foot,
four inches.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.820
The man who climbed into it

08:53.860 --> 08:55.225
was a good five inches shorter
than the roof.

08:55.260 --> 08:56.761
The real Ian Gale

08:56.800 --> 08:58.665
is an impressive
six foot, one.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.588
It's a magnificent device.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.961
I would thank Mr. Gale himself
if he were here, but he's not.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.035
Since he's not,
why don't you tell us?

09:05.070 --> 09:06.708
Did he murder Haley Tyler
himself,

09:06.740 --> 09:09.208
or did the company hire someone
to do that for him, too?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.773
This meeting
is over.

09:12.820 --> 09:15.175
(phone buzzing)

09:15.220 --> 09:16.778
(buzzing continues)

09:16.820 --> 09:19.084
(sighs)

09:22.690 --> 09:24.021
(sighs)

09:24.060 --> 09:25.618
Hello?

09:25.660 --> 09:26.922
Good morning, Joan.
It's Mycroft.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.621
Did I wake you?

09:28.660 --> 09:30.890
Um... a little.
Is everything okay?

09:30.930 --> 09:32.261
Well,

09:32.300 --> 09:33.938
the reason _
I'm calling so early IS,

09:33.970 --> 09:35.938
I was wondering, is everything
okay with Sherlock?

09:35.970 --> 09:37.665
Why do you ask?

09:37.710 --> 09:40.008
Well, he was supposed to meet me
here at the restaurant

09:40.040 --> 09:41.337
last night. He never showed.

09:41.380 --> 09:42.802
I've tried his cell a few times,
no answer.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.147
I was just a bit concerned.

09:44.180 --> 09:45.340
Well, we were up pretty late

09:45.380 --> 09:47.211
trying to locate
a missing billionaire.

09:47.250 --> 09:48.945
He was still at it
when I went to bed.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.346
Did you know this is
the third time he's stood me up?

09:51.390 --> 09:52.880
Have you met your brother?

09:52.920 --> 09:54.751
Well, this is my last

09:54.790 --> 09:56.883
available night before I go,
so, if you wouldn't mind...

09:56.930 --> 09:58.227
I will make sure

09:58.260 --> 09:59.818
he is there.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.953
(sighs)
Good morning.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.968
Yup.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.060
Oh. I take it the search
for Ian Gale is still on?

10:07.100 --> 10:08.795
Any progress?

10:08.840 --> 10:11.661
Of a sort.
Establishment of facts,

10:11.710 --> 10:13.371
elimination of places
he is not.

10:13.410 --> 10:16.675
He has not, for example,
been seen at his office or any

10:16.710 --> 10:19.178
of his known residences for
perhaps as long as SIX weeks.

10:19.210 --> 10:20.711
I also reviewed other,

10:20.750 --> 10:22.115
ostensible public
appearances of his

10:22.150 --> 10:24.687
during his trip abroad,
and I have

10:24.720 --> 10:27.359
confirmed it was_ the stand-in
every tIme.

10:27.390 --> 10:29.927
Whatever events precipitated
Miss Tyler's death,

10:29.960 --> 10:31.655
it seems_ that Ian Gale
and his company

10:31.690 --> 10:33.726
have been preparing
for some time.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.227
(sighs)
I still don't get it.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.125
I mean, why would one
of the biggest corporations

10:37.170 --> 10:40.094
on the planet help its CEO
commit and cover up a murder?

10:40.140 --> 10:41.789
Well, I'll wager

10:41.840 --> 10:43.728
that the answer will ultimately
boil down to "money."

10:43.770 --> 10:45.863
In the meantime,
I've found cause for optimism

10:45.910 --> 10:47.969
that Gale might still be
in New York.

10:48.010 --> 10:49.705
His private jet came
straight back here

10:49.750 --> 10:52.719
after depositing the imposter
in Malaysia.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.012
Hasn't been used since.

10:54.050 --> 10:55.677
I put out feelers
to some of my contacts

10:55.720 --> 10:57.085
at New York's finest hotels.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.089
I've also advised the police
to surveil the homes

11:00.120 --> 11:02.418
of some of his closest friends.
Any luck,

11:02.460 --> 11:06.351
we'll be able to pose those
questions to the man himself.

11:06.390 --> 11:07.891
You didn't tell me that you were

11:07.930 --> 11:09.329
supposed to have dinner
with Mycroft last night.

11:09.360 --> 11:10.896
Was I supposed to?
Well, he called me

11:10.930 --> 11:12.022
this morning-- he was
worried about you.

11:12.070 --> 11:13.935
He wants to try again tonight.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.767
Well, if we manage to bring
Haley Tyler's killer

11:15.800 --> 11:16.960
to justice today,
then I'll be

11:17.010 --> 11:18.204
more than happy
to accommodate him.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.776
And if we don't,
just try

11:19.810 --> 11:21.368
and remember that
you have a partner now.

11:21.410 --> 11:23.071
(cell phone chimes)
So, I can still

11:23.110 --> 11:26.341
_ work the _case _
while you have dinner, right?

11:26.380 --> 11:29.440
Unfortunately, the balancing act
which you prescribe

11:29.480 --> 11:31.482
may prove unnecessary--
it seems that

11:31.520 --> 11:34.683
finding Ian Gale may not be
as challenging as I had thought.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.458
The entire floor
of this hotel

11:37.490 --> 11:39.458
has been booked solid
for the past month

11:39.490 --> 11:41.799
under the name
Frank Beaufort.

11:41.830 --> 11:44.321
It's a rather sloppy
alias, if you ask me.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.396
Sir Francis Beaufort
was a 19th-century

11:47.440 --> 11:50.329
Irish naval officer
who devised the system

11:50.370 --> 11:52.406
by which we measure
wind speeds at sea.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.329
Including
"gale force"?
Hmm.

11:55.380 --> 11:58.941
Unless I'm off my mark,
Mr. Gale has reserved
the floor to himself

11:58.980 --> 12:00.413
to avoid prying eyes.

12:00.450 --> 12:02.816
And what makes you
think he's just gonna

12:02.850 --> 12:04.442
open his door for us?

12:08.790 --> 12:10.519
One keycard to access
every room

12:10.560 --> 12:14.257
on the aforementioned floor,
courtesy of my contact here.

12:17.430 --> 12:20.991
Do I even want to know?
He's a chef in the
hotel restaurant.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.905
He has rather
exotic tastes.

12:22.940 --> 12:25.306
The package contains
half a pound of
Swedish moose cheese,

12:25.340 --> 12:28.104
one of the rarest
and most expenswe
cheeses in the world,

12:28.140 --> 12:30.472
produced only three times
a year by a single farm

12:30.510 --> 12:32.398
in the county
of Vasterbotten.

12:32.450 --> 12:35.772
I did the owners a favor
once, and they keep me
in fresh supply.

12:35.820 --> 12:38.448
This is one of those
"so many questions" moments.

12:38.490 --> 12:41.516
Why only
three times a year?
Well, I'm not sure.

12:41.560 --> 12:45.781
Having never milked a
moose, I imagine one must
catch it in the right mood.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.099
I don't know how
you got up here,

12:52.130 --> 12:53.438
but this is
a private floor.

12:53.470 --> 12:55.529
Yeah, it's a bit too
private, actually.

12:55.570 --> 12:57.333
Sherlock Holmes.
Joan Watson.

12:57.370 --> 12:59.235
We're consulting detectives.
Hotel security asked us

12:59.270 --> 13:01.204
to come upstairs,
have a look around.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.299
Hotel security
did not send you.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.568
Thank you for confirming
that you are not them.

13:05.610 --> 13:09.114
You're in the private
employ of Ian Gale or his
company, are you not?

13:09.150 --> 13:11.880
Well, you might
not know this, so I
consider it only fair

13:11.920 --> 13:14.252
to inform you that
you're protecting a
suspected murderer.

13:14.290 --> 13:16.986
If you continue to
protect him by the time
the police arrive,

13:17.030 --> 13:19.157
you will in all likelihood
be charged with obstruction.

13:19.190 --> 13:21.192
You say your name
was Holmes?
I did.

13:28.940 --> 13:31.909
(steady beeping nearby)

13:36.180 --> 13:37.909
MAN:
Mr. Holmes,

13:37.950 --> 13:40.919
Miss Watson, come in.

13:46.090 --> 13:47.557
(steady beeping continues)

13:47.590 --> 13:49.922
(labored breathing)

13:52.930 --> 13:55.091
This is my wife,

13:55.130 --> 13:56.620
Natalie.

13:56.660 --> 13:59.561
My attorneys made me
aware of your...

13:59.600 --> 14:01.636
inquiries.

14:01.670 --> 14:04.207
You've got it all wrong.

14:04.240 --> 14:07.277
I'm not hiding because
I committed some crime.

14:07.310 --> 14:10.006
I'm hiding because I'm...

14:10.050 --> 14:12.268
under the weather.

14:12.310 --> 14:15.074
This is why your company
sent a decoy to Malaysia--

14:15.120 --> 14:17.588
word of your condition
would cause shareholder panic.

14:17.620 --> 14:19.508
Stocks would plummet.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.518
NATALIE:
The board needed time

14:21.560 --> 14:23.983
to prepare a transition.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.429
And your relationship
to Haley Tyler?

14:25.460 --> 14:27.621
Also not what you think.

14:27.660 --> 14:29.321
(labored breathing)

14:29.360 --> 14:31.669
She wasn't my mistress.

14:31.700 --> 14:34.464
She was my daughter.

14:40.110 --> 14:41.930
Are you saying you're in need
of a heart transplant?

14:41.980 --> 14:43.902
He's saying he already had one
about a month ago,

14:43.950 --> 14:46.145
but his body is
rejecting the new heart.
According to this,

14:46.180 --> 14:48.648
everything was going fine
for the first couple of weeks,

14:48.680 --> 14:50.511
and then the antirejection drugs
stopped working.

14:50.550 --> 14:52.916
NATALIE:
He's on corticosteroids,
cyclosporine--

14:52.960 --> 14:56.384
but... his body is producing
too many antibodies.

14:56.420 --> 14:59.150
There's only so much
the drugs can do.

14:59.190 --> 15:02.023
In layman's terms, I'm, uh...

15:02.060 --> 15:05.962
I'm too much of a fighter
for my own good.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.992
NATALIE: He is on
every donor list.

15:09.040 --> 15:12.362
But there is no guarantee
that another heart

15:12.410 --> 15:14.537
will become available in time.

15:14.580 --> 15:18.072
You also have Kell-null blood;
that is very rare.

15:18.110 --> 15:19.941
You would have needed
a directed donor

15:19.980 --> 15:21.413
for blood transfusions.

15:21.450 --> 15:22.986
That's why your daughter
came in from Texas,

15:23.020 --> 15:24.510
right, she had the
same blood type?

15:24.550 --> 15:26.347
I read your autobiography
last night.

15:26.390 --> 15:29.154
In it, you failed to mention
that you have a daughter.

15:29.190 --> 15:32.557
May I assume it was
because she is the result of...

15:32.590 --> 15:33.955
an indiscretion?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.969
One-night stand...

15:37.000 --> 15:40.436
years before I met Natalie.

15:40.470 --> 15:44.031
I was a bit full of
myself back then.

15:44.070 --> 15:46.038
It was the mid-'80s

15:46.070 --> 15:49.130
Computers were...
changing the world,

15:49.180 --> 15:51.705
and my face was on the cover
of every mag...

15:51.750 --> 15:54.139
every magazine.
HOLMES:
You were worried

15:54.180 --> 15:57.308
that an illegitimate child
might affect your... "legacy."

15:57.350 --> 15:59.409
I paid her mother

15:59.450 --> 16:02.055
$2 million to disappear.

16:02.090 --> 16:05.184
So, fast-forward
to several months ago.

16:05.230 --> 16:08.051
You find out that
you need a blood donor,

16:08.100 --> 16:10.318
and you realize that
your estranged daughter

16:10.370 --> 16:13.589
may well be
a likely match, so...

16:13.640 --> 16:16.495
it suddenly becomes expedient
to reconcile.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.508
Haley volunteered
to donate the blood.

16:18.540 --> 16:21.202
That's the reason
she came to New York.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.344
I'm confused.
How did she find out

16:23.380 --> 16:26.201
he's in need if you're working
so hard to keep this a secret?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.468
Hmm? At what point
did she even find out

16:28.520 --> 16:31.114
that Ian Gale is her father?
When Ian found out

16:31.150 --> 16:32.549
that he needed a transplant,

16:32.590 --> 16:34.785
he wanted to make up
for the past.

16:34.820 --> 16:36.617
So he wanted
to bring Haley

16:36.660 --> 16:40.289
back into his life
to have a relationship with her,

16:40.330 --> 16:41.649
in case...

16:41.700 --> 16:43.395
In case it was my last chance.

16:44.730 --> 16:47.392
When we heard what had
happened yesterday,

16:47.440 --> 16:50.534
we knew we should...
we should have said something.

16:50.570 --> 16:53.038
Admitting your connection
to Haley

16:53.080 --> 16:55.401
would mean revealing
your condition.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.577
(labored breathing)

16:56.610 --> 16:58.248
I'm ashamed.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.770
But now...

16:59.810 --> 17:02.779
I don't care how
it affects the company.

17:02.820 --> 17:05.414
I'll give you any help you want.

17:05.450 --> 17:08.658
Just find the person
that killed my daughter.

17:10.690 --> 17:13.818
Well, thanks to you two,
the Gales are cooperating fully.

17:13.860 --> 17:16.124
They got any and all
of their people

17:16.160 --> 17:18.628
that were in Haley Tyler's
apartment the last few days

17:18.670 --> 17:20.638
to provide elimination prints.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.763
Any of the prints
remain unspoken for?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.836
So far, just one set,

17:24.870 --> 17:26.667
and it isn't_in
our system, either.

17:26.710 --> 17:28.405
We got the Feds checking
their database,

17:28.440 --> 17:30.772
but it might take a while
to get some answers.

17:30.810 --> 17:33.313
(sighs) Well, the killer's
probably gonna turn out to be

17:33.350 --> 17:34.612
someone that Haley knew, right?

17:34.650 --> 17:36.618
I mean, there were
no signs of a break-in.

17:36.650 --> 17:38.743
I'll let you know
if anything turns up.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.155
(cell phone chimes)

17:41.190 --> 17:42.817
Ah. Dr. Hawes
from the morgue.

17:42.860 --> 17:45.522
I asked him to notify
us when he finished
examining Haley Tyler.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.097
He says there doesn't
appear to be anything
out of the ordinary,

17:48.130 --> 17:49.597
but we might as well
see for ourselves.

17:49.630 --> 17:51.666
You want to go
to the morgue?
Is that a problem?

17:51.700 --> 17:53.736
You were supposed to meet
Mycroft at Diogenes.

17:53.770 --> 17:55.465
I'm working.
So take a break.

17:55.500 --> 17:56.637
A break?
It's the last night
he can do it.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.399
He may not be back
for a while.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.237
We should be so luclq.
Just go.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.633
Okay, I will go
to the morgue.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.375
I will call you
ifI find anything.

18:03.410 --> 18:06.140
Partner, remember?
I can cover for you.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.438
You must by now be aware
of my opinions regarding food.

18:12.490 --> 18:14.151
My wants in life
are simple:

18:14.190 --> 18:15.714
a loaf of bread
and a clean collar.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.455
The ritualization-
slash-fetishization

18:17.490 --> 18:19.219
of eating is
as egregious

18:19.260 --> 18:21.194
a waste of time
as I can think of.

18:21.230 --> 18:25.462
Well, I'll try and remember that
while I'm enjoying my dinner.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.464
WATSON:
I see here that
you ruled a stab wound

18:31.510 --> 18:32.761
as the official cause of death.

18:32.810 --> 18:34.630
The knife severed
the abdominal aorta.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.205
She'd have bled
to death internally
in a matter of seconds,

18:37.250 --> 18:38.842
whether she fell
from the terrace or not.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.370
Mmm. So Sherlock
was probably right--

18:40.420 --> 18:42.445
the fall was not
part of the plan.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.710
Killer knew right where
to put the knife, though.

18:44.750 --> 18:46.786
Single entry,
avoided the rib cage,

18:46.820 --> 18:48.481
killed her fast.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.750
You think it was someone
with a medical background?

18:50.790 --> 18:52.451
The alternative's
dumb luck.

18:52.490 --> 18:54.924
But, hey, dumb luck
happens sometimes.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.825
(bell dings)

18:58.400 --> 18:59.890
Yo. Hey.
Hey.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.898
Didn't know you
were gonna be here.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.339
This is Maureen Tyler,

19:03.370 --> 19:05.531
Haley's mom.
This is Joan Watson.

19:05.570 --> 19:07.879
She consults for the NYPD.

19:07.910 --> 19:10.208
I'm so sorry
for your loss.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.547
Thank you.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.639
Now, you sure you
want to do this?

19:29.460 --> 19:32.520
I had with her was an argument?

19:32.570 --> 19:33.832
(shudders)

19:36.840 --> 19:40.401
Is that when she found out
that Ian was her father?

19:44.510 --> 19:47.877
She was upset.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.445
(whispers):
Mostly with me.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.311
(sniffles)
Ian didn't care
about her

19:53.360 --> 19:55.612
until...

19:55.660 --> 19:57.787
he realized he needed her.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.479
BELL:
I take it you didn't

19:59.530 --> 20:00.895
want her helping him.

20:00.930 --> 20:03.990
I didn't try to stop her
from giving blood.

20:04.030 --> 20:06.521
I didn't hate him that much.

20:06.570 --> 20:07.889
I just didn't think

20:07.940 --> 20:10.363
she should come
to New York.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.379
I knew it would end badly.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.328
Mrs. Tyler...

20:16.380 --> 20:18.848
I promise you, we're gonna do
everything in our power

20:18.880 --> 20:21.314
to find the person
who did this to her.

20:21.350 --> 20:24.547
You don't have to look very far.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.582
(crying):
I know exactly who killed her.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.417
(sobbing)

20:32.360 --> 20:34.555
Now, tell me that
wasn't more satisfying

20:34.600 --> 20:36.556
than a bout of singlestick.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.591
Just because I tend to forego
epicurean pleasures,

20:38.630 --> 20:41.360
it doesn't _mean
I can't appreCIate them.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.402
It was exquisite.

20:43.440 --> 20:44.509
Thank you.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.269
Yeah.

20:47.810 --> 20:50.699
Look, I know you're keen
to go back to the station,

20:50.750 --> 20:51.899
but before you do,

20:51.950 --> 20:53.611
there was something

20:53.650 --> 20:55.641
I wanted to give you.

20:57.820 --> 21:00.584
The keys to 2213.

21:02.820 --> 21:05.027
My 2213?

21:05.060 --> 21:07.824
I had my things moved
while I was here in New York.

21:07.860 --> 21:09.555
Found a little place
in Kensington.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.864
And besides, it was never
anything more than your home.

21:11.900 --> 21:14.494
You belong there, not me.

21:14.540 --> 21:17.429
Well, I appreciate the gesture,

21:17.470 --> 21:19.506
but I live here now.

21:19.540 --> 21:20.507
Permanently?

21:20.540 --> 21:22.007
I haven't decided.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.578
Mmm, does that surprise you?

21:24.610 --> 21:26.043
Well, London wasn't
just your home,

21:26.080 --> 21:27.513
Sherlock, it was your passion.

21:27.550 --> 21:29.472
Well, I have many passions.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.909
Work being first amongst them.

21:31.950 --> 21:34.316
And speaking of work...

21:34.360 --> 21:35.782
Look, I-I didn't want
to get into this,

21:35.820 --> 21:37.356
but it seems I have no choice.

21:37.390 --> 21:39.881
I... I spoke with Father
a couple of nights ago.

21:39.930 --> 21:41.750
He's quite...

21:41.800 --> 21:44.621
perturbed
you're still living here.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.661
What?
I know he wasn't

21:46.700 --> 21:48.497
the most demonstrative,
but he was quite proud

21:48.540 --> 21:50.360
of the work you did
at Scotland Yard,

21:50.410 --> 21:52.503
and he'd imagined that
once you completed

21:52.540 --> 21:54.531
your rehabilitation,
you'd return to England,

21:54.580 --> 21:57.674
maybe even show a little...
gratitude.

21:57.710 --> 21:59.405
Early-onset dementia is so sad.

21:59.450 --> 22:01.418
Look, I know you two
have had your problems,

22:01.450 --> 22:03.680
but he's been good to you
these past few years,

22:03.720 --> 22:05.813
Sherlock-- he literally
picked you up off the street.

22:05.850 --> 22:07.954
He got you clean.
He paired you with Joan.

22:07.990 --> 22:11.084
He helped me because he was
embarrassed by what I'd become.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.451
Well, whatever his reasons,
he's grown unhappy.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.691
I'm worried he's going
to cut you off.

22:16.730 --> 22:18.561
He reminded me he owns

22:18.600 --> 22:20.431
the building you currently
reside in.

22:20.470 --> 22:21.994
He plans to evict me?

22:22.040 --> 22:23.962
He also reminded me
he has discretionary control

22:24.010 --> 22:25.830
over your trust fund.

22:25.870 --> 22:28.907
I've only ever touched that
money to pay Watson her salary.

22:28.940 --> 22:31.101
It doesn't change the fact
that you are, in your own way,

22:31.150 --> 22:32.799
still dependant on him,
Sherlock.

22:34.180 --> 22:36.114
Well, he can have
the bloody building.

22:36.150 --> 22:38.846
And the money. I'll live in
a cardboard box ifI have to.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.381
This isn't about you anymore,
Sherlock.

22:41.420 --> 22:42.853
If it was, I wouldn't have
broached the subject.

22:42.890 --> 22:44.653
But for the first time
in your life,

22:44.690 --> 22:47.454
you're making decisions
for two people.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.127
Joan may be your partner,

22:49.160 --> 22:51.128
but it's Father's roof
over her head,

22:51.170 --> 22:53.593
it's his money that lines
her pockets.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.733
Now, if you want to
tell him to sod off,

22:55.770 --> 22:57.465
that's your prerogative.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.933
But as someone who cares
for you, and for Joan,

22:59.970 --> 23:05.408
I beg you, think about how your
decision might affect her.

23:07.180 --> 23:08.909
WATSON:
We met with Haley's mother

23:08.950 --> 23:10.508
earlier tonight.

23:10.550 --> 23:12.017
She came to New York?

23:14.190 --> 23:16.954
Well... I-I guess I
shouldn't be too surprised

23:16.990 --> 23:18.821
she didn't reach out.

23:18.860 --> 23:21.420
I know she was opposed
to Haley coming here.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.928
Well, she mentioned that shortly
after Haley arrived in New York,

23:23.970 --> 23:27.167
your husband changed his will
to include her.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.839
We talked about it. We thought
it was the right thing to do.

23:29.870 --> 23:32.930
Now, Mrs. Tyler
was under the impression

23:32.970 --> 23:34.676
it was a lot of money.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.678
As in a number
followed by seven zeroes.

23:36.710 --> 23:38.177
That's right.

23:38.210 --> 23:40.144
_ She was also_under the
impre55ion that it was money

23:40.180 --> 23:42.148
that would've otherwise
gone to you.

23:42.180 --> 23:44.512
Yes, the will was changed,

23:44.550 --> 23:46.689
and yes, the money allotted
to Haley

23:46.720 --> 23:48.881
would technically
have been mine.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.729
We spoke to some people
at the hotel

23:50.760 --> 23:52.751
where you and Ian
have been staying.

23:52.790 --> 23:54.929
They told us that you went out
yesterday morning.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.895
You left around
7:30 a.m.,

23:57.930 --> 24:00.490
and you returned
around 9:30 am.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.964
We know that Haley was killed
a little after 8:00.

24:04.010 --> 24:07.935
I did go out for a couple
of hours yesterday.

24:07.980 --> 24:12.770
I went for a walk after sitting
at my husband's bedside

24:12.810 --> 24:14.072
all night long.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.712
I left my phone

24:15.750 --> 24:19.083
and I went to the park
and I sat on a bench.

24:19.120 --> 24:20.951
And no one can confirm
your story?

24:20.990 --> 24:22.685
It's not a story.

24:22.720 --> 24:23.857
I noticed your ease

24:23.890 --> 24:26.552
with medical terms
when we met yesterday.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.956
I assumed you picked it up from
being around all those doctors,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.128
but then I checked-- you were
a doctor yourself, weren't you?

24:32.170 --> 24:33.967
A pediatric surgeon.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.831
You retired a few years ago.

24:35.870 --> 24:38.065
So?
So, whoever killed Haley

24:38.110 --> 24:40.704
knew exactly where to find
her abdominal aorta.

24:40.740 --> 24:41.877
There was a precision
to the attack

24:41.910 --> 24:44.470
that one might call surgical.

24:46.850 --> 24:48.715
Okay, a couple of things.

24:48.750 --> 24:51.685
I am going to call
my attorney.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.984
In fact, I am going to call
all of my attorneys.

24:54.020 --> 24:54.816
Not because I think
I need their help,

24:54.860 --> 24:56.179
but because I want them
to be ready

24:56.220 --> 24:58.029
to bring a lawsuit
against this department

24:58.060 --> 25:00.278
if you take any of these
accusations public.

25:00.330 --> 25:03.720
You are positing
that I killed Haley

25:03.770 --> 25:07.228
because she was assigned a
portion of my inheritance.

25:07.270 --> 25:09.830
There is just one problem.

25:09.870 --> 25:13.203
Giving her that 20% was my idea.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.970
I love my husband.

25:16.010 --> 25:18.649
He was too proud to reach out
to Haley at first,

25:18.680 --> 25:19.977
and so I convinced him.

25:20.010 --> 25:21.716
So if all I cared about
was the will,

25:21.750 --> 25:23.012
why would I have done that?

25:23.050 --> 25:24.915
Why wouldn't I have just
let it alone

25:24.950 --> 25:26.815
and let Ian take his chances?

25:26.850 --> 25:28.056
BELL:_
I'm assuming
your husband

25:28.090 --> 25:29.159
can verify all this?

25:29.190 --> 25:32.682
He can. He can also verify

25:32.730 --> 25:34.322
that there is language
in the will

25:34.360 --> 25:38.126
that guarantees Haley's share
goes to her mother

25:38.170 --> 25:40.866
in the event that
she predeceases her.

25:40.900 --> 25:44.666
Haley's death didn't
change anything for me.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.736
Maureen might have been
able to tell you that

25:47.780 --> 25:51.238
if she had supported
Haley's decision

25:51.280 --> 25:53.271
instead of condemning it.

26:06.660 --> 26:08.355
HOLMES:
I'd sooner die.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.027
WATSON:
So, it's official.

26:10.060 --> 26:13.166
The Gales are no longer
cooperating with the NYPD.

26:13.200 --> 26:15.634
They gave a copy of Ian's will
to Captain Gregson

26:15.670 --> 26:18.639
and it confirmed everything
that Natalie said last night.

26:18.670 --> 26:20.706
Okay, so now
you can say it.

26:20.740 --> 26:22.901
Say what?
I blew it.

26:22.940 --> 26:24.305
You confronted a suspect

26:24.350 --> 26:26.978
who had strong answers
to your questions.

26:27.010 --> 26:28.819
Doesn't mean you
were wrong about her.

26:28.850 --> 26:31.819
Natalie Gale had no motive
to want Haley dead.

26:31.850 --> 26:35.058
Haley wasn't even in their lives
until she brought her here.

26:35.090 --> 26:37.183
Why would Natalie
incite a reunion,

26:37.220 --> 26:38.949
tell Ian to put her
in the will

26:38.990 --> 26:40.719
only to turn around
and kill her?

26:40.760 --> 26:43.399
(phone ringing)

26:43.430 --> 26:45.967
Detective, I hear it was
a discouraging morning.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.332
BELL:
Yeah, I've had better.

26:48.370 --> 26:49.928
But it's looking up.

26:49.970 --> 26:52.006
Finally got a match
on the one set of prints

26:52.040 --> 26:54.679
in Haley Tyler's apartment
we couldn't identify.

26:54.710 --> 26:57.235
Ray McKibben
of Mineral Wells, Texas.

26:57.280 --> 27:00.408
Has an outstanding warrant
for assault in El Paso.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.748
I just sent you his sheet.

27:02.780 --> 27:04.714
Now, I ran the name past
Haley's mother.

27:04.750 --> 27:07.082
She said Ray was Haley's
on-again, off-again boyfriend.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.782
She had no idea
he was in New York.

27:09.820 --> 27:11.287
Far as she knew,
they'd split up.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.355
The cops in Mineral Wells
are checking

27:13.390 --> 27:16.052
with his usual running buddies,
but he hasn't turned up yet.

27:16.100 --> 27:17.658
Maybe he's still
in New York?

27:17.700 --> 27:19.429
I put a BOLO out on the guy.

27:19.470 --> 27:22.030
I'll let you know
if we get any hits.

27:22.070 --> 27:24.300
When Haley found out she
was a billionaire's daughter,

27:24.340 --> 27:25.967
I'm guessing
Mr. On-Again/Off-Again

27:26.010 --> 27:28.035
would've been a lot more
on again.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.071
Obviously he
joined her here.

27:30.110 --> 27:32.908
Too bad the only thing
we know is where he isn't.

27:32.950 --> 27:34.918
Well, that's not true.

27:34.950 --> 27:37.987
We also know where he's been.

27:38.020 --> 27:39.908
WATSON:
I'm not seeing any signs

27:39.950 --> 27:41.918
that Ray spent
a lot of time here.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.053
We know that Haley
had not told her mother

27:44.090 --> 27:46.058
she'd reconnected
with a violent offender,

27:46.090 --> 27:49.321
so it's quite possible
she was keeping his presence

27:49.360 --> 27:52.158
a secret from the Gales as well.

27:55.100 --> 27:58.001
So, how was your dinner
with Mycroft last night?

27:58.040 --> 28:00.201
What if I told you

28:00.240 --> 28:02.071
we could no longer reside
in the brownstone?

28:02.110 --> 28:05.079
What?
And what if I told you that
in order to pay your salary,

28:05.110 --> 28:07.874
we'd need to take on more cases
that actually paid?

28:07.920 --> 28:09.410
Where is this coming from?

28:09.450 --> 28:11.281
My father.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.049
Mycroft tells me
he is displeased

28:13.090 --> 28:14.819
and he wants me back
in London.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.010
Why does he want you
back in London?

28:17.060 --> 28:19.051
I don't think he does.

28:19.090 --> 28:20.899
Not really.

28:20.930 --> 28:23.194
But it might take him months,
if not years,

28:23.230 --> 28:25.323
before he realizes that.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.134
The man is as mercurial
a character

28:28.170 --> 28:31.105
as you will ever
encounter. Hmm.

28:31.140 --> 28:33.700
Mycroft says he means
to cut me off.

28:35.140 --> 28:36.471
I didn't realize

28:36.510 --> 28:39.047
that you were paying me
with his money.

28:39.080 --> 28:40.342
Well, I wasn't.

28:40.380 --> 28:42.109
Not for a good long while.

28:42.150 --> 28:44.084
But over the last few months,
I've been compelled

28:44.120 --> 28:46.816
to dip into a fund
that he maintains.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.751
Haven't taken on a paying client
in quite some time.

28:49.790 --> 28:51.428
I've been approached
on numerous occasions,

28:51.460 --> 28:53.348
of course, but...

28:53.390 --> 28:55.199
the interest has never
been mutual.

28:55.230 --> 28:58.119
I prefer the work we come by
through the NYPD,

28:58.170 --> 28:59.797
as I believe do you.

29:02.470 --> 29:06.133
There is, as there so often is
when dealing with the devil,

29:06.170 --> 29:08.070
an alternative.

29:10.010 --> 29:12.046
We both move to London.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.240
What are you saying?

29:16.280 --> 29:18.043
I told Mycroft I made certain
promises to you

29:18.090 --> 29:19.887
when I took you on
as my partner.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.854
I made it very clear I would not
break those promises.

29:21.890 --> 29:23.551
He said that it was
his strong suspICIon

29:23.590 --> 29:27.128
that Father would continue to
gift us his support in London.

29:27.160 --> 29:30.425
We would in all likelihood
take on work at Scotland Yard.

29:30.460 --> 29:32.018
You could continue,
if not maybe,

29:32.070 --> 29:34.265
complete your education there.

29:34.300 --> 29:35.392
Is that what you want?

29:35.440 --> 29:36.566
What I want is irrelevant.

29:36.600 --> 29:37.806
Pretty sure it's not.

29:41.610 --> 29:45.341
I was very pleased to return
to London a few months ago.

29:45.380 --> 29:48.019
Not just because
it is unquestionably

29:48.050 --> 29:51.281
the greatest and most cultured
city on the planet,

29:51.320 --> 29:54.357
but because it made me
appreCIate what I have here.

29:54.390 --> 29:56.483
I've got a support system--

29:56.520 --> 29:58.021
you...

29:58.060 --> 29:59.584
Captain Gregson.

29:59.630 --> 30:02.190
Even Detective Bell.

30:02.230 --> 30:05.961
I feel that I have thrived here,
not because of who I am,

30:06.000 --> 30:09.231
but because of who
I have come to know.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.569
I don't really wish
to give that up

30:14.610 --> 30:18.000
until I'm ready.

30:20.250 --> 30:22.377
Your turn.

30:29.560 --> 30:32.381
I've never met your father,
not face-to-face.

30:32.430 --> 30:35.399
All I know is that he got you
help when you needed it.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.867
But screw him.

30:39.900 --> 30:41.834
We can find a new place to live.

30:52.550 --> 30:55.144
Do you think the TV
is going to tell us

30:55.180 --> 30:57.068
how to find Ray McKibben?
TV? No, no.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.089
The DVR, on the
other hand...

31:00.120 --> 31:03.112
Televisions are idiot boxes.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.525
DVRs are idiots' helpers.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.357
We are the idiots.

31:06.390 --> 31:09.223
We quite willingly give
them a part of ourselves,

31:09.260 --> 31:10.989
we teach them our tastes,
our preferences,

31:11.030 --> 31:13.066
just so that they will know
which programs to record.

31:13.100 --> 31:15.261
Never once stopping
to consider the fact

31:15.300 --> 31:18.303
that our selections can
be used to proﬁle us.

31:18.340 --> 31:20.205
And how is Haley's
profile going to...

31:20.240 --> 31:21.571
Someone programmed
this DVR

31:21.610 --> 31:23.134
to record a series
about horse racmg

31:23.180 --> 31:26.069
called The Winner's Circle.

31:26.110 --> 31:27.509
The episodes have
been piling up

31:27.550 --> 31:29.518
since the day Haley
was murdered.

31:29.550 --> 31:32.348
And yet all of her
cosmetics, all of them,

31:32.390 --> 31:34.278
are cruelty-free.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.185
Seems a little incongruous,
don't you think,

31:36.220 --> 31:38.381
someone with such
principled buying habits

31:38.430 --> 31:41.922
would favor a sport known for
its harsh treatment of animals?

31:41.960 --> 31:44.099
So you think Ray is the one
who's been watching these shows?

31:44.130 --> 31:45.995
According to the program's
description, The Winner's Circle

31:46.030 --> 31:48.169
"caters to the betting
man via in-depth analysis

31:48.200 --> 31:49.531
of upcoming races."

31:49.570 --> 31:51.299
Four days ago,

31:51.340 --> 31:54.275
someone set the DVR to record
the Thoroughbred Cup Challenge

31:54.310 --> 31:56.972
2:00 pm. today.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.568
Given Mr. McKibben's
arrest warrants,

31:58.610 --> 32:00.669
I think it highly unlikely
that he would be willing

32:00.710 --> 32:02.314
to enter the personal
information needed

32:02.350 --> 32:04.944
to open an online
betting account.

32:04.990 --> 32:08.187
So, if he's in New York
and he wants to place a wager,

32:08.220 --> 32:11.348
he would have to do it in person
at a track.

32:13.490 --> 32:17.426
My horse finally
literally comes in

32:17.460 --> 32:19.519
and you guys arrest me.

32:19.570 --> 32:21.993
I feel for you, Ray. I do.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.008
You've had a rough week, but...

32:24.040 --> 32:25.337
not nearly as rough
as your girlfriend.

32:25.370 --> 32:26.337
I already told you, I didn't

32:26.370 --> 32:27.530
have anything to do with that.

32:27.570 --> 32:28.537
GREGSON:
Do yourself a favor, Ray.

32:28.580 --> 32:29.706
Tell us the truth--

32:29.740 --> 32:31.207
did you two have a fight?

32:32.580 --> 32:34.343
I wasn't even there
the morning she died.

32:34.380 --> 32:36.211
Okay? I was out.

32:36.250 --> 32:39.481
I came back, I saw the blood on
the floor and Haley was gone.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.181
At which point your sense
of civic duty kicks in,

32:41.220 --> 32:43.017
you rush to the phone, you call
the authorities to report

32:43.060 --> 32:45.551
that your girlfriend may have
become the victim of foul play.

32:45.590 --> 32:47.319
I didn't know what happened
to her; all I knew

32:47.360 --> 32:48.588
was that nobody
was going to believe me

32:48.630 --> 32:50.097
when I said it wasn't me.

32:50.130 --> 32:51.358
If you weren't
in Haley's apartment

32:51.400 --> 32:53.095
when she died,
where were you?

32:53.130 --> 32:54.563
She was sick.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.158
She had been
for a couple of weeks.

32:56.200 --> 32:58.509
The flu... or something.

32:58.540 --> 33:00.235
The night before,
she ran out of medicine

33:00.270 --> 33:01.771
so I went down to the pharmacy
to get some more.

33:01.810 --> 33:04.199
She had the flu?

33:04.250 --> 33:05.501
Yeah, her body ached all over.

33:05.550 --> 33:08.246
She was burning up, like 102.

33:08.280 --> 33:11.283
And you said she had been
like that for two weeks?

33:11.320 --> 33:13.584
That's when
it started, yeah.

33:13.620 --> 33:17.283
At first it was just,
you know, fatigue,

33:17.320 --> 33:18.548
but then,
a couple of days ago,

33:18.590 --> 33:20.455
she started having trouble
keeping food down

33:20.490 --> 33:22.026
and her fever got really bad.

33:22.060 --> 33:23.459
I'm guessing
you can give us

33:23.500 --> 33:25.263
the address of
this pharmacy.

33:25.300 --> 33:27.268
Eighth Street and Kent.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.394
They got to have
cameras, right?

33:30.440 --> 33:33.603
Check 'em, you'll see
I'm telling the truth.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.177
I wasn't anywhere near Haley
when she got killed.

33:45.450 --> 33:47.418
You gonna make me ask?

33:47.450 --> 33:50.749
Miss Tyler's alleged flu--
it troubles you.

33:50.790 --> 33:53.179
When I looked at Ian Gale's
medical file the other day,

33:53.230 --> 33:56.688
I saw that Haley donated
blood just over a week ago,

33:56.730 --> 33:59.426
but if she had a flu or
was fighting an infection,

33:59.470 --> 34:00.494
she wouldn't have
been allowed.

34:00.530 --> 34:01.838
She may not have
mentioned it.

34:01.870 --> 34:03.838
No, if she was as sick
as Ray said she was,

34:03.870 --> 34:05.599
someone would
have noticed.

34:05.640 --> 34:09.474
Well, not everyone is
as observant as you and I.

34:09.510 --> 34:10.738
But, given
our strongest suspect

34:10.780 --> 34:12.247
may have just
alibied himself,

34:12.280 --> 34:14.817
I think it warrants
further investigation.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.209
Yeah, you were right.

34:18.250 --> 34:21.708
Miss Tyler donated one unit
exactly eight days ago.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.751
Was there any mention
of her having the flu?

34:23.790 --> 34:25.621
No.

34:25.660 --> 34:27.355
Would it be possible
for me to speak

34:27.390 --> 34:29.551
to the person
who actually took her blood?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.488
Actually you are.

34:31.530 --> 34:33.361
And she didn't seem sick to you?

34:33.400 --> 34:35.368
She was fine.

34:35.400 --> 34:38.767
Even joked with me
about "topping off" the bag.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.506
She was a sweet kid.

34:41.540 --> 34:44.179
So, according to the lab tech
that took Haley's blood,

34:44.210 --> 34:45.746
she was in the pink
of health,

34:45.780 --> 34:47.771
but as we know, Ray McKibben's
alibi checked out.

34:47.810 --> 34:50.176
He really was at that pharmacy
buying flu medicine

34:50.220 --> 34:51.687
when she went off the terrace.

34:51.720 --> 34:53.585
I think it's time we
turned our focus back

34:53.620 --> 34:54.450
to your original suspect,

34:54.490 --> 34:57.516
she of the flimsy
alibi, Mrs. Gale.

34:57.560 --> 35:00.779
I'd love to, if she had
a motive to kill Haley.

35:00.830 --> 35:03.355
(phone rings)
(sighs)

35:04.400 --> 35:06.425
Detective.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.866
Thank you for
telling us.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.130
Ian Gale has just died.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.504
The company will be releasing
a statement shortly.

35:20.510 --> 35:23.172
I think maybe we've been coming
at this case the wrong way.

35:25.720 --> 35:29.417
What if it's not actually
about the murder of Haley Tyler?

35:32.260 --> 35:35.149
What if it's really
about the murder of Ian Gale?

35:43.670 --> 35:48.300
(knocking)

35:48.340 --> 35:50.831
Captain, I thought I
made it clear on the
phone the other day...

35:50.880 --> 35:52.438
Yeah, you said you'd
sue the department

35:52.480 --> 35:54.175
if your client
was subjected

35:54.220 --> 35:56.415
to any additional harassment
for Haley Tyler's murder,

35:56.450 --> 36:00.409
but we're not here
to talk about her murder.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.715
We're here to talk
about Ian Gale's.

36:03.760 --> 36:06.320
HOLMES:
I had no idea
until Miss Watson told me--

36:06.360 --> 36:07.725
the recovery rate
for the procedure

36:07.760 --> 36:10.251
that your husband
had is around 80%.

36:10.300 --> 36:11.699
LAWYER:
Captain, what
is this about?

36:11.730 --> 36:13.766
Ian Gale died of natural causes.

36:13.800 --> 36:14.767
Mrs. Gale,

36:14.800 --> 36:16.438
is it not true

36:16.470 --> 36:17.732
that approximately
ten months ago,

36:17.770 --> 36:19.601
you briefly engaged
the services

36:19.640 --> 36:20.937
of a divorce attorney?

36:20.970 --> 36:22.403
You don't have
to answer that.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.839
He's right,
you don't.

36:23.880 --> 36:25.404
We already know.

36:25.450 --> 36:27.247
We also know that,
prior to your marriage,

36:27.280 --> 36:28.679
you signed a
prenuptial agreement.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.642
In the event of a divorce,
you would walk away

36:30.680 --> 36:34.514
with a prearranged sum
of $15 million.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.289
But then it became_ clear
that Ian was gomg

36:36.320 --> 36:37.753
to need
a heart transplant,

36:37.790 --> 36:40.224
and you came up with a plan
to walk away with more.

36:40.260 --> 36:42.296
None of you
are making any sense.

36:42.330 --> 36:46.266
First you accuse me
of hurting Haley, and now Ian.

36:46.300 --> 36:47.426
LAWYER:
The best doctors
in the world

36:47.470 --> 36:49.335
were caring for him.

36:49.370 --> 36:51.930
There's no way anyone could have
caused a rejected transplant.

36:51.970 --> 36:54.404
Actually there is...

36:54.440 --> 36:56.635
or at least there was
in Ian's case.

36:56.680 --> 36:59.979
First you needed to convince him
to reconcile with Haley.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.341
I mean,
you could have found

37:01.380 --> 37:02.745
other blood donors
with his rare type,

37:02.780 --> 37:05.578
but you needed someone
you could keep close,

37:05.620 --> 37:07.781
someone
you could manipulate.

37:07.820 --> 37:08.912
A few weeks ago,
after Ian's transplant,

37:08.960 --> 37:10.780
you obtained
a tissue sample

37:10.820 --> 37:14.324
of his new heart from a biopsy
and injected it into Haley.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.021
You told her the shot
was a supplement

37:16.060 --> 37:17.618
to help
with blood donations,

37:17.660 --> 37:20.367
and she believed you because
you used to be a doctor.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.539
Her immune system went
into overdrive

37:22.570 --> 37:24.936
producing antibodies,
the same antibodies

37:24.970 --> 37:26.460
that your husband
was being given

37:26.510 --> 37:28.398
antirejection drugs
to combat.

37:28.440 --> 37:29.930
That's why
she was getting sick.

37:29.980 --> 37:31.379
She didn't have
any flu.

37:31.410 --> 37:33.275
Her body was fighting
a foreign invader,

37:33.310 --> 37:34.948
and she wasn't getting
any help.

37:34.980 --> 37:36.675
You used her
as an incubator

37:36.720 --> 37:38.915
to cultivate _
a custom-made p0ison

37:38.950 --> 37:40.815
_for which there
is no tox screen.

37:40.850 --> 37:42.613
(scoffs)
I was good to Haley.

37:42.660 --> 37:43.684
BELL:
You gave Haley

37:43.720 --> 37:46.029
20% of your inheritance,
right?

37:46.060 --> 37:49.029
Only now we know it wasn't out
of the kindness of your heart.

37:49.060 --> 37:50.550
It was because
you needed her.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.966
And because the remaining
80% was still about

37:53.000 --> 37:55.434
a hundred times more
than you would have
gotten in a divorce.

37:55.470 --> 37:57.438
I assume you can prove
all this.

37:57.470 --> 37:58.539
We're working
on that.

37:58.570 --> 38:01.300
In the meantime,
we have a witness.

38:01.340 --> 38:04.571
HOLMES:
Your accomplice,
Christian Suarez, one of

38:04.610 --> 38:07.443
the lab techs who was assisting
with your husband's care.

38:07.480 --> 38:09.345
But you know that.

38:09.380 --> 38:12.884
We had some very pointed
questions for him this morning.

38:12.920 --> 38:15.480
He confessed to providing you
with biopsy tissue.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.579
He also admitted

38:17.620 --> 38:19.485
to harvesting antibodies
from Haley's blood

38:19.530 --> 38:21.498
and injecting them into Ian.

38:21.530 --> 38:24.988
All for the tidy sum
of $1 million.

38:25.030 --> 38:26.725
WATSON:
When Ian's health turned,

38:26.770 --> 38:29.864
it looked to_his doctors like
an overactive immune response.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.902
His system was creating
too many antibodies

38:31.940 --> 38:33.737
and attacking the new heart.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.477
HOLMES:
You decided you had
to eliminate Haley,

38:36.510 --> 38:39.399
lest she grow so ill that
someone tipped to the truth.

38:39.450 --> 38:41.372
Unfortunately for you,

38:41.420 --> 38:43.809
that murder did not go off
without a hitch.

38:43.850 --> 38:46.614
Mr. Suarez said that you
intended to stage the scene

38:46.650 --> 38:48.959
as a botched robbery, but after
she went off the balcony,

38:48.990 --> 38:51.424
you had no choice but to flee.

38:51.460 --> 38:54.020
GREGSON:
We're still gathering evidence.

38:54.060 --> 38:56.756
The M.E. is running new tests
on Haley's blood.

38:56.800 --> 39:00.497
And if we find out what we think
we're gonna find out,

39:00.530 --> 39:03.328
now is your chance
to get ahead of this.

39:04.940 --> 39:07.465
(doorbell ringing)

39:11.450 --> 39:13.509
Hmm.

39:20.650 --> 39:24.381
Cutting it a little close
for the red-eye, aren't we?

39:24.430 --> 39:25.988
A few bits of business
at the restaurant.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.759
Changed my flight
till the morning.

39:27.790 --> 39:30.020
And since you wanted to see me,
I thought I'd stop by.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.972
What's this?

39:43.010 --> 39:44.978
It's a letter for Father.

39:46.610 --> 39:49.443
I'm to play messenger, am I?

39:49.480 --> 39:51.016
You did for him.

39:51.050 --> 39:53.109
He didn't ask me to speak
with you, Sherlock.

39:53.150 --> 39:55.550
I merely...
I know,
and I am grateful.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.955
Part of recovery is...
structure.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.128
Recognizing what is working
and sticking with it.

40:07.170 --> 40:09.889
What I have here
with Watson...

40:09.940 --> 40:12.431
is working.

40:13.970 --> 40:15.733
There may well come a time

40:15.780 --> 40:18.647
when it is right for me
to return to London, but, uh,

40:18.680 --> 40:21.877
it isn't now.

40:25.190 --> 40:28.148
In it, I express what I consider
to be an appropriate amount

40:28.190 --> 40:30.681
of gratitude
for everything he's done.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.779
And I explain,
in minute detail,

40:32.830 --> 40:35.424
my decision to remain
in New York.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.620
That can't have been easy
for you.

40:38.670 --> 40:41.730
It was not unlike carving
the words into my very skin.

40:43.770 --> 40:45.567
It's all I can offer for now.

40:45.610 --> 40:49.171
You know how capricious
he can be.

40:49.210 --> 40:52.998
The chips will fall as they may.

40:59.220 --> 41:02.758
You're so different
now, Sherlock.

41:05.230 --> 41:08.222
You are, essentially, the same.

41:17.700 --> 41:20.032
I'll be back.

41:20.070 --> 41:22.538
Diogenes will need me.

41:22.580 --> 41:24.138
Until then.

41:24.180 --> 41:27.775
*

41:33.220 --> 41:35.256
(door closes)

42:02.350 --> 42:04.944
*

42:18.930 --> 42:20.568
It's me.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.261
My little gambit didn't work.

42:22.300 --> 42:24.188
He's decided to stay.

42:25.910 --> 42:28.333
He hasn't spoken directly
with my father in years.

42:28.370 --> 42:30.008
There's little chance
either Will realize

42:30.040 --> 42:31.678
what I've attempted.

42:33.610 --> 42:35.077
I'm afraid we're going to have

42:35.120 --> 42:37.111
to come at the problem
a different way.
