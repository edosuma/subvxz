WEBVTT

00:06.939 --> 00:09.738
Here comes my main man, Matty!
Time for a haircut, Matty, though.

00:09.809 --> 00:11.470
Don't make me give it to ya.

00:11.544 --> 00:14.980
- You the man, Professor.
- You're the man if you stay in school, J.J!

00:15.048 --> 00:16.879
- All right.
- All right, you.

00:16.950 --> 00:20.078
Lisa, how's the G.P.A.?
Keep it up, up, up, up, up!

00:20.954 --> 00:22.444
Professor!

00:22.522 --> 00:25.082
Hey, there's my man. Oh, time-out, son!

00:25.158 --> 00:28.059
Hang on, son.
Uh, did you forget something here?

00:28.128 --> 00:30.062
- Sorry?
- This orange- it belong to you?

00:30.130 --> 00:32.826
- Uh, no.
- Looks pretty good. Not too peeled.

00:32.899 --> 00:35.026
Pretty intact here. You want it?

00:35.101 --> 00:36.966
No, thanks. I'm cool, Professor.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.096
You're cool?
Well, when you're cool, you're cool.

00:39.172 --> 00:42.232
Well, hey! Dee, how's it going?

00:42.308 --> 00:44.902
Teacher's lounge. Pretty sweet.
How'd you swing that?

00:44.978 --> 00:48.414
I'm a teacher now, Charlie. I'm subbing
for Dr. Myers while he gets his hip fixed.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.745
Look at us with our new careers, huh?
How 'bout that?

00:50.817 --> 00:53.445
Yours is kinda the same, you know,
'cause you've always sort of been a janitor.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.182
- Nah, but I'm thriving here, I'll tell you what.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

00:56.256 --> 00:58.656
- Did you get that orange out of the garbage?
- I sure did.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.558
Can you believe that? Someone threw this
away. Perfectly good orange, you know?

01:01.628 --> 01:04.461
They were digging at it a little bit,
and must've given up, but -

01:04.531 --> 01:06.795
- Don't eat trash, Charlie.
- I'll eat what I want to eat, okay?

01:06.866 --> 01:09.391
- Miss Reynolds, please report
to the front office immediately.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.266
You have an emergency call.

01:11.337 --> 01:14.204
- Miss Reynolds, to the front office, please.
- Emergency?

01:14.274 --> 01:15.866
Come on. Jump on that.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.871
- Hello?
- Yeah. Hey, Dee. It's Dennis, Mac and Frank.

01:19.946 --> 01:22.813
- Hey, what's the matter?
- I've only just heard. I've only just heard.

01:22.882 --> 01:26.648
Your belly's so fat, you make John Candy
look like Lara Flynn Boyle.

01:26.719 --> 01:28.584
- Snap!
- What?

01:28.655 --> 01:30.885
We've been on a snap-joke kick
about your pregnant body...

01:30.957 --> 01:32.948
but since you're not around,
we decided to call you.

01:33.026 --> 01:36.018
I don't know. He's talking about a Lara Flynn
Boyle joke. I think we got some better ones.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.963
- I have another one.
- Goddamn it, you guys! I am a teacher now, okay?

01:39.032 --> 01:40.693
Don't ever call me here again!

01:40.767 --> 01:44.362
I don't have time for your shit,
you dumbass dickbags!

01:45.972 --> 01:47.633
Wrong number. Sorry.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074

02:27.480 --> 02:30.210
Okay. Good morning, everybody.
Hi. Good morning.

02:30.283 --> 02:34.617
Uh, as you are all aware,
Dr. Myers recently broke his hip...

02:34.687 --> 02:38.885
and, unfortunately,
I've been given some devastating news...

02:38.958 --> 02:41.290
that he's taken a turn for the worse...

02:41.361 --> 02:43.352
and he's died.

02:43.429 --> 02:48.457
Now, while we all feel robbed of him
here on Earth...

02:48.535 --> 02:51.265
heaven above...

02:51.337 --> 02:53.635
has just received another angel.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.799
And that...

02:55.875 --> 02:58.275
is what you call...

02:58.344 --> 03:01.438
a monologue!

03:01.514 --> 03:05.575
You guys, you're all gonna be doing
your own monologues in this class.

03:05.652 --> 03:08.246
Now, they're not gonna be as good
as mine just was, but listen...

03:08.321 --> 03:11.813
- I don't want you to beat yourselves up for -
- Okay, okay. I'm confused.

03:11.891 --> 03:13.825
So, Dr. Myers isn't dead?

03:13.893 --> 03:16.054
No, no. No, not dead. Very much alive.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.620
But that's the power of acting.
Do you see what I'm saying?

03:18.698 --> 03:21.758
One minute dead,
the next minute alive- resurrection.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.268
It's all acting! Everywhere there's acting.

03:24.337 --> 03:29.274
Let's talk about you guys. Why don't you
tell me, uh, what your favorite play is.

03:31.244 --> 03:34.805
Raise your hand
if you've ever seen live theater.

03:36.149 --> 03:39.312
Seriously? Are you kidding me?

03:39.385 --> 03:40.875
All right. That's it.

03:40.954 --> 03:45.482
I am taking you guys
on a field trip to Broadway!

03:49.262 --> 03:50.923
I'm taking you to New York City.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.931
- Whoa! Yeah!
- Yes! Yes!

03:52.999 --> 03:55.024
- Yeah!
- They've got really good Chinese food.

03:55.101 --> 03:58.298
Hey, fat bitch,
how you doing today, Richard?

03:58.371 --> 04:02.102
- He's a happy clown.
- Hey, hey, hey! Break it up! Break it up!

04:02.175 --> 04:03.938
Aw, come on.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.171
Which one of you guys did this?
Who painted your face, kid?

04:06.246 --> 04:09.044
- I did.
- He's a dumbass Juggalo.

04:09.115 --> 04:12.141
- Juggalos for life, bitch!
- Watch what you say, Richard.

04:12.218 --> 04:14.277
Hey, hey! You watch what you say!
All right. You know what?

04:14.354 --> 04:17.050
I want the three of you out of the bathroom.
I'm talking to the clown.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.785
Let's go. And I got my eyes on you guys
for the rest of the year.

04:19.858 --> 04:23.158
Yeah, I've sized you up. I've stripped you down.
I don't like what I see.

04:23.229 --> 04:26.630
I'm not impressed.
Big tough guys, huh? Big tough guys!

04:26.699 --> 04:29.065
- Yeah.
- Kid, what's going on with the clown makeup, though?

04:29.135 --> 04:31.831
- You're sticking out like a sore thumb.
- That's 'cause I'm a Juggalo.

04:31.904 --> 04:34.464
I.C.P.!. Insane Clown Posse, yo.

04:34.540 --> 04:37.134
I don't know what that -
You have a posse? Well, good.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.701
Stick with your insane clown people,
and you won't get jumped.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.610
They're a band, dude.

04:41.681 --> 04:44.514
I'm, like, a die-hard fan.
We're called Juggalos.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.313
Where are your real friends, dude?

04:46.386 --> 04:48.183
I lost all my friends.

04:48.254 --> 04:50.916
Aw, shit, man.

04:50.990 --> 04:52.981
I lost all my friends too.

04:53.059 --> 04:55.391
All right.
I'll tell you what. You know what?

04:55.461 --> 04:57.952
If you want to wear your clown makeup
in school, wear it.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.692
I got your back. You won't get jumped.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.166
Yeah, I ain't exactly allowed
to wear my makeup in school, though.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.759
- Oh, really?
- Bunch of bullshit, dawg!

05:03.836 --> 05:07.567
That is bullshit!
All right, kid, today's your lucky day, all right?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.631
We're gonna talk to the principal, okay?

05:09.709 --> 05:12.610
'Cause the professor
just took an interest in ya!

05:14.314 --> 05:17.215
I'm bored to tears.

05:17.283 --> 05:19.843
Let's go harass Charlie and Dee.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.012
We don't need Charlie and Dee
to have fun, okay?

05:22.088 --> 05:24.056
We can figure out
something to do without them.

05:24.123 --> 05:27.615
You know, guys? Now might be a good time
to do our Lethal Weapon 5 reshoots.

05:27.694 --> 05:30.026
Why would we do reshoots on that?
That movie was perfect.

05:30.096 --> 05:33.088
Yeah, I was great in it,
and my villain was very evil.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.294
No, you did a great job, Frank. I'm not
talking about that. Your villain was amazing.

05:36.369 --> 05:40.203
- I'm referring more to the blackface of it all.
- What's wrong with the blackface?

05:40.273 --> 05:42.764
Well, I seriously regret switching parts
with you halfway through...

05:42.842 --> 05:44.935
and letting you play Murtaugh in blackface.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.241
I feel like it was in very poor taste
in retrospect.

05:47.313 --> 05:50.476
I think it was in poor taste
that you were doing Murtaugh in whiteface.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.018
I mean, for God's sakes, Dennis,
what message does that send?

05:53.086 --> 05:55.554
A lot of great actors have done blackface.

05:55.621 --> 05:59.352
Oh, you know, there's countless examples
of very classy actors doing blackface.

05:59.425 --> 06:02.656
Let's see, we've got
the great C. Thomas Howell in Soul Man.

06:02.729 --> 06:04.629
We've got the Wayans brothers
in White Chicks.

06:04.697 --> 06:07.928
That was a very tasteful example
of reverse blackface.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.661
Okay, those are bad examples, okay?

06:09.736 --> 06:13.172
There's tons of good examples
of old movies with- Frank, help me out.

06:13.239 --> 06:14.763
Laurence Olivier in Othello.

06:14.841 --> 06:16.968
- Laurence Olivier in Othello, dude.
- Perfect.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.908
- That's the classiest actor of all time.
- Perfect.

06:18.978 --> 06:22.345
Yeah, but I guarantee you there was some
black people that were working on that movie...

06:22.415 --> 06:25.851
that were, like, "Man, what dat white man
doing? Dat ain't right. Get a black man."

06:25.918 --> 06:27.715
- Okay, so hold on.
- What kind of voice is that?

06:27.787 --> 06:29.687
You're doing a black voice,
and that's not racist?

06:29.756 --> 06:31.815
I'm just saying that's how black people talk.
That's not racist.

06:31.891 --> 06:34.189
So you would do a black guy
with a black voice...

06:34.260 --> 06:36.421
but not a black guy with a black face?

06:36.496 --> 06:38.964
I don't have a problem at all
with doing a black voice.

06:39.031 --> 06:40.828
- That's just an accurate portrayal.
- I don't understand that.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.391
I'm just saying
it's just about doing it tastefully, okay?

06:43.469 --> 06:45.437
Yeah, and you got to make the lips funny.

06:45.505 --> 06:47.097
- Oh, no!
- No, no, no. What?

06:47.173 --> 06:49.801
- They have to be funny. The lips have to be outlined.
- It's not about funny.

06:49.876 --> 06:52.538
It's not about being funny at all, okay?
It's about -

06:52.612 --> 06:54.341
Oh, my God! I'm getting pissed off!

06:54.414 --> 06:57.144
- You can't do the voice without the lips.
- Everybody calm down.

06:57.216 --> 07:00.481
Clearly, we're not gonna come to any
conclusions here today, so let's move past it.

07:00.553 --> 07:03.181
- Let's do something else.
- Okay, right. We can find something to do.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.692
Let's just figure it out. Let's put our heads
together. Come on. Think, think.

07:10.663 --> 07:12.995
So, you want to take them to New York?

07:13.065 --> 07:14.623
- Yes, to Broadway.
- Oh.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.965
I tell you what. I brought it up -
the kids are super stoked about it.

07:18.037 --> 07:21.029
- Now, let's talk hotel rooms.
- Um, you know, I -

07:21.107 --> 07:23.371
- I guess the first point I'd like to make -
- Mm-hmm?

07:23.443 --> 07:27.709
- Uh, Miss Reynolds, is, uh, you are a substitute.
- That's right.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.341
So I really don't think you should be
hauling students across state lines.

07:31.417 --> 07:33.817
- Hmm.
- Secondly -

07:33.886 --> 07:37.117
Secondly, the funding
for arts programs here is pretty much -

07:37.190 --> 07:39.158
- It's pretty much nonexistent.
- Hmm.

07:39.225 --> 07:40.886
It's shameful, but that's the way it is.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.691
So even if I did have the money,
I would never -

07:44.764 --> 07:48.097
- And I emphasize never -
- Mm-hmm.

07:48.167 --> 07:51.102
give it to someone whom I've just met.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.434
Knock, knock, knock.
Uh, am I interrupting?

07:53.506 --> 07:56.066
- Yes, we were right in the middle of something.
- Yes, thank you.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.770
- She's not giving you too much trouble, is she?
- No. Oh, my gosh.

07:58.845 --> 08:01.006
- So you two know each other.
- No, we met in -

08:01.080 --> 08:02.570
- Yeah, we're best friends.
- Best friends.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.013
- We're best friends.
- Excellent.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.313
Uh, Principal MacIntyre, I recently, uh -

08:06.385 --> 08:08.376
I started mentoring one of the kids here.

08:08.454 --> 08:11.218
Really?
That's odd, because you're a janitor.

08:11.290 --> 08:15.386
Yeah. Uh, but Richie here is a hell of a kid,
and he's struggling.

08:15.461 --> 08:18.191
You see, he's what he calls, uh, a juggler.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.232
- Juggalo, bro.
- Juggalo. He's a Juggalo.

08:20.299 --> 08:21.994
- Juggalo.
- It's sort of a clown posse.

08:22.068 --> 08:25.526
I figured you and I were getting tight enough
that I could maybe come in here...

08:25.605 --> 08:29.063
and ask that he be allowed
to wear his makeup in school.

08:29.141 --> 08:34.374
Uh, well, uh, you know, it's school policy
that no one should paint their face.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.610
So that's the rule,
and that's the end of that.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.378
- That's the rule.
- Yep.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.443
- There's no wiggle room there.
- No.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.149
Tell you what. I'll take him
to the locker room, lather him up real good.

08:44.222 --> 08:46.987
I'll strip all these silly-ass clothes off him,
and I'll clean him sparkling clean.

08:47.059 --> 08:49.254
- Brand-new kid for you. Bring him back up.
- No. No, no.

08:49.328 --> 08:51.728
Please don't bathe the students.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.287
You're right.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.664
He's a big man.
He can bathe himself, can't you, Rich?

08:55.735 --> 08:58.033
- Yeah, dawg.
- He's bathing himself, and I'm watching.

08:58.104 --> 09:00.231
Let's go, Richie.
You're getting cleaned up. Come on!

09:00.306 --> 09:01.739
I'd rather you didn't do that either.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.877
Okay, there it is.
Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer.

09:06.946 --> 09:09.210
- How is that not racist to you?
- What?

09:09.282 --> 09:12.649
This is a terrible example of blackface.
This guy isn't trying to look like a real person.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.812
He almost got the mouth right.
See, that's what I'm saying about the lips.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.913
The lips are the most offensive part.

09:17.990 --> 09:22.586
The guy is bugging his eyes out like a cartoon
character, okay? This is racist as shit.

09:22.662 --> 09:25.153
All blackface is racist,
and that is the point I'm trying to make.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.359
You just cannot cast a white man
as a black man and paint his face black.

09:28.434 --> 09:30.197
- You can't do it.
- They're actors.

09:30.269 --> 09:32.362
They're trying to create an illusion.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.906
In The Lord of the Rings movie,
Ian McKellen plays a wizard.

09:34.974 --> 09:38.432
Do you think he goes home at night and shoots
laser beams into his boyfriend's asshole?

09:38.511 --> 09:39.705
I don't think so, dude.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.269
Tom Cruise is a midget...

09:41.347 --> 09:43.508
but he plays guys
that are normal size in movies.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.778
- But again, nobody's buying that either.
- Okay, look at this.

09:45.851 --> 09:49.446
This is Laurence Olivier in Othello,
and this is James Earl Jones.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.513
- Now, look at how close they look.
- Look at that.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.025
James Earl Jones is doing a great blackface.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.789
James Earl Jones has a black face!
He's a black man.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.126
- He's not black.
- Of course, he's black!

09:59.198 --> 10:01.166
He was Darth Vader!

10:01.233 --> 10:02.723
Darth Vader was black.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.770
- See? Okay, there we go.
- Darth Vader was not black.

10:04.837 --> 10:07.203
They took the mask off. He was white.

10:07.273 --> 10:10.970
- I'm telling you, look, look.
We got to agree on this.

10:11.043 --> 10:14.672
- The whole idea is getting the right color shoe polish.
- No!

10:14.747 --> 10:17.944
Frank, if you're starting with shoe polish,
you're starting off on the wrong foot, buddy.

10:18.017 --> 10:20.315
No way. Shoe polish?
And he's on your side.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.377
Stop arguing for me, okay? I got it.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.945
Hold on. This is Dee. Let's -

10:24.023 --> 10:26.685
Hey, hey, Dee.
Uh, can you weigh in on something for us?

10:26.759 --> 10:28.351
- We're trying -
- Hey, no. No time.

10:28.427 --> 10:31.294
Listen, I need you to do something for me.
Can you clear out the bar?

10:31.364 --> 10:34.527
I'm gonna bring some students from the classroom
by, and we're gonna screen a movie there.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.160
- Why?
- Because I need these kids to respect me, you know...

10:37.236 --> 10:39.227
and I want to show 'em how cool I am, so -

10:39.305 --> 10:42.433
- Plus, I feel like this would be a really
good opportunity to... Dennis, cover it up.

10:42.508 --> 10:45.909
This is an opportunity to screen Laurence
Olivier's Othello movie, you know?

10:45.978 --> 10:48.242
- Then we can get an audience to weigh in.
- That's not a bad idea.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.714
We can really take the temperature on this
with a large group.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.944
- Yeah. Kids are honest as shit.
- Yeah.

10:53.019 --> 10:55.351
- Hi! Hello!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Dee, we're on it.

10:55.421 --> 10:58.185
- We'll take care of the movie.
- No, no. You're not taking care of the movie.

10:58.257 --> 10:59.884
You're not railroading me on this, okay?

10:59.959 --> 11:02.359
This is my thing. It's my movie.
Don't- I'll do the movie.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.487
No, Dee, it's a classic, okay?
It's Shakespeare.

11:04.563 --> 11:06.053
Othello. Laurence Olivier. Come on.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.965
Othello?
Oh. I'm sorry. I have to apologize.

11:09.035 --> 11:10.900
That's actually a really good idea.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.234
Ooh, plus, it'll give me the opportunity -

11:13.305 --> 11:15.773
Okay, enough of that.
Guys, let's get set up for a screening.

11:15.841 --> 11:18.036
All right. We're gonna do it.

11:21.647 --> 11:25.139
Uh, gentlemen, hello.
How do you do? Long time no see.

11:25.217 --> 11:27.276
I'd like to introduce you
to my protégé Richie.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.253
Richie, these are the guys. Say hello.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.983
- What up? Juggalo for life.
- What the hell is he talking about?

11:32.058 --> 11:34.492
- Drop it with the Juggalo thing. You're embarrassing me.
- Nah, I'm cool.

11:34.560 --> 11:39.395
Okay. Now, I know you're all super stoked
about watching a movie in a bar...

11:39.465 --> 11:41.399
but we're just gonna keep it
on the down low.

11:41.467 --> 11:44.061
You know what I mean? We don't need
your parents and the principal finding out.

11:44.136 --> 11:46.070
- It's just our little secret.
- I've been in a bar before.

11:46.138 --> 11:48.436
- No, you haven't.
- I've been in this bar before, so -

11:48.507 --> 11:52.204
Okay, you know what? Let's just watch
the movie and stop with our smart mouths.

11:52.278 --> 11:55.076
Uh, without further "adieu," Othello.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.978
So I guess this is a Shakespearean movie.

11:57.049 --> 12:00.416
It's gonna be a little bit boring.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.455
Oh, shit!
Lethal Weapon 5! This is great.

12:12.531 --> 12:14.294
- What the hell is this?
- It's our movie.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.391
It's a much more modern-day
example of blackface.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.131
- It's the most direct way to clear up
our argument, Dee, so... What argument?

12:19.205 --> 12:21.366
- What are you talking about?
- Shh! The movie's on.

12:28.447 --> 12:30.711
This is a good movie, Richie.
You're gonna enjoy this.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.444
Man, I ain't seen the first couple, though.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.638
Happy retirement, Rog.

12:53.706 --> 12:57.403
I'll be happy when I'm
far away from your sorry ass, Riggs.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.637
Just blow out the candles, Rog.
Make a wish.

12:59.712 --> 13:02.806
Uh, I never know what to wish for
with these damn things.

13:02.882 --> 13:06.079
- That voice really is amazing, dude.
- Oh, thanks, man. Thank you.

13:06.152 --> 13:09.588
Riggs, Murtaugh! Bad news, fellas.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.247
Hey, Captain.

13:11.323 --> 13:14.884
Turns out another person
just died from tainted tap water.

13:16.328 --> 13:17.852
Turns out someone taint -

13:17.930 --> 13:19.830
Someone tapped the tainted water supply.

13:19.899 --> 13:21.890
We should have cut him out completely.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.094
The person who just died was your wife.

13:26.772 --> 13:28.399
Riggs.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.271
Yeah, Rog.

13:30.342 --> 13:32.572
I just thought of my wish.

13:44.523 --> 13:48.357
- Yeah. You see him right there?
- Oh, I see him.

13:52.865 --> 13:57.632
You like sharks, Detective?

13:57.703 --> 14:01.104
Powerful and majestic creatures.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.868
What is going on? Where are you?

14:02.942 --> 14:04.432
Frank splurged on a green screen.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.944
But he wouldn't pay
for the green screen on our side, so -

14:07.012 --> 14:08.639
- We're not in the back office.
- We're in a casino.

14:08.714 --> 14:12.206
Why would I know anything
about the tainted water?

14:12.284 --> 14:16.277
Maybe because your rival tribe owns
the water rights to half of Los Angeles.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.119
I need clean drinking water too!

14:19.191 --> 14:21.853
Even sharks need water.

14:24.396 --> 14:26.887
Excuse me.

14:26.966 --> 14:29.025
If you leave now...

14:29.101 --> 14:33.470
I have some pressing matter to deal with.

14:47.620 --> 14:49.451
Ahh.

14:57.663 --> 15:00.097
Tsk. Kinda comes out of nowhere...

15:00.165 --> 15:01.792
but at least it's classy.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.334
Here comes the turn.

15:07.773 --> 15:10.264
I don't know why we, uh -

15:14.079 --> 15:15.876
Oh, Chief!

15:15.948 --> 15:18.678
Don't say anything. Quiet!

15:18.751 --> 15:21.185
Quiet. Good. Very nice. Oh!

15:21.253 --> 15:23.278
- Oh, come on.
- This is unwatchable.

15:23.355 --> 15:26.017
- Gotta dive in.
- Just finish already!

15:46.045 --> 15:48.775
Now that you are Riggs and not Murtaugh...

15:48.847 --> 15:52.544
and I have caught you alone,
you are going to get it.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.815
- Wait. You guys switched parts?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.973
As more people die...

16:21.046 --> 16:25.983
the city will be looking
to new resources for water...

16:26.051 --> 16:27.643
like my tribe!

16:28.754 --> 16:31.314
And you can bet your boots, Detective...

16:31.390 --> 16:32.755
that this time -

16:32.825 --> 16:36.090
This is regrettable.

16:36.161 --> 16:41.098
You're supposed to be... a noble people.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.134
I tire of this conversation.

16:43.202 --> 16:45.136
Do you have any last words?

16:45.204 --> 16:48.696
Yeah, I got some last words.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.902
Go suck an egg.

16:51.977 --> 16:54.275
Yeah, go suck an egg.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.938
Go suck an egg?

16:56.015 --> 16:58.916
Sounds like
you guys are having a great party.

16:58.984 --> 17:00.542
Why wasn't I invited?

17:12.464 --> 17:14.295
Oh!

17:15.534 --> 17:16.626
Yaah!

17:23.675 --> 17:26.143
Ah! It's playing. It's playing.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.633
This is the greatest movie I've ever seen.

17:49.701 --> 17:52.636
Are you filming this, Richie?
No. Come on, dude. That's bootlegging.

17:52.704 --> 17:54.365
I'll get you a copy. Don't bootleg.

18:02.381 --> 18:05.509
Okay. You want to dance?
All right, Chief Lazarus.

18:14.259 --> 18:18.025
How 'bout a little tainted tap water?

18:22.935 --> 18:24.493
Yes! Yes!

18:24.570 --> 18:26.538
Yeah!

18:33.112 --> 18:34.841
Great job, Rog.

18:34.913 --> 18:37.575
That's one... fried turkey.

18:40.686 --> 18:43.246
All right. Let's get out of here.

18:58.937 --> 19:01.098
We got 'im, baby.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.947
I miss ya, kid.

19:35.474 --> 19:39.706
# There's a haunted dwarf
sittin' on my porch #

19:39.778 --> 19:42.269
# Gonna beat me up- #

19:42.347 --> 19:47.011
Okay. Wow. I think that video
says more than I ever could.

19:48.253 --> 19:49.914
As does that.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.748
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

19:54.826 --> 19:57.761
So, we're fired, yeah?

19:57.829 --> 19:59.387
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.

19:59.464 --> 20:02.092
Probably never should have been hired
in the first place, though, huh?

20:02.167 --> 20:03.828
- That was my bad.
- Mmm.

20:03.902 --> 20:07.269
- Right, that's on you.
- Yeah, I probably won't be here much longer myself.

20:07.339 --> 20:10.740
- No, I don't imagine you will,
on account of the -

20:10.809 --> 20:13.573
I got something that might cheer us all up.

20:13.645 --> 20:15.875
Who wants a little bit of -

20:15.948 --> 20:18.610
- Little bit of deliciousness here?
- I'm not gonna eat that.
