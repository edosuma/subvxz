WEBVTT

00:00.130 --> 00:01.700
- Previously
on "God Friended Me"...

00:01.700 --> 00:03.630
- The gallery we went to
the other day

00:03.630 --> 00:04.770
was actually owned by
Audrey Grenelle.

00:04.770 --> 00:05.770
- She has a private collection

00:05.770 --> 00:07.400
at the Louvre.

00:07.400 --> 00:08.810
- This image is made
entirely out of binary code.

00:08.810 --> 00:10.910
- My story is in New York
with you.

00:10.910 --> 00:13.940
- I love you, Cara.
I know you can't say that yet.

00:13.940 --> 00:15.310
So take all the time you need.

00:15.310 --> 00:17.010
- After I gave up my daughter
for adoption,

00:17.010 --> 00:20.050
I unsealed her adoption records
and it was worth it.

00:20.050 --> 00:24.590
I saw her with her family,
and she looked happy.

00:29.090 --> 00:31.290
- ♪ Hello, good morning,
how you doing ♪

00:31.290 --> 00:34.000
- It feels good to be back
in New York

00:34.000 --> 00:36.930
and with a new mystery
to solve.

00:36.930 --> 00:38.800
The God Account led me
to Paris

00:38.800 --> 00:40.970
where I found a painting
called "The Path,"

00:40.970 --> 00:44.140
and this painting holds
the answer to my future.

00:44.140 --> 00:47.210
So, yeah, things are
getting interesting.

00:48.210 --> 00:50.880
- So, I had my coding team
digitize the painting,

00:50.880 --> 00:52.080
make sure we're not missing
anything obvious

00:52.080 --> 00:53.350
that we couldn't see before.

00:53.350 --> 00:55.080
I don't think the image is

00:55.080 --> 00:57.820
what we were supposed to be
focused on.

00:57.820 --> 01:00.260
This is the code overlay
on top of the image.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.260
This has to be
where the message is hidden.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.130
So, I've been running the code
through a decryption software

01:04.130 --> 01:06.760
for the last 48 hours straight.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.970
- And?
- Well, it's a process.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.030
- So, nothing.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.040
- Without that pattern key
used to create it,

01:14.040 --> 01:16.310
there's no way to determine
which of the digits

01:16.310 --> 01:17.640
are important and which aren't.

01:17.640 --> 01:18.770
- Okay, so how do we get
our hands

01:18.770 --> 01:20.010
on the key to unlock it?

01:20.010 --> 01:22.140
- Well, I'd need access
to the AI program

01:22.140 --> 01:23.710
that created the painting,
and the only person

01:23.710 --> 01:24.710
who can give that to us is--

01:24.710 --> 01:26.350
- Audrey Grenelle.

01:26.350 --> 01:28.980
Were you able to find out
when her gallery opening is?

01:28.980 --> 01:31.090
- Yeah, it's tomorrow,
but I spoke with Annie,

01:31.090 --> 01:32.250
and Audrey Grenelle
rarely attends

01:32.250 --> 01:33.920
her own gallery openings.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.930
- There must be a way
to get in contact with her.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.060
- I say we head down there,
maybe we can find someone

01:38.060 --> 01:39.230
who can get us in touch
with her.

01:39.230 --> 01:40.330
- It's worth a shot.

01:40.330 --> 01:42.630
- Wha--hold up.

01:42.630 --> 01:43.730
I'm sorry.

01:43.730 --> 01:44.970
So now Cara's back,
and suddenly

01:44.970 --> 01:45.970
I'm not a part of the team
anymore?

01:45.970 --> 01:47.200
- Don't you need to

01:47.200 --> 01:48.940
research and develop
or something?

01:48.940 --> 01:51.310
- It's not like I'm putting
hammer to a nail.

01:51.310 --> 01:52.740
Okay?

01:52.740 --> 01:54.040
I'm thinking about stuff
all the time.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.950
Plus, hey,
the gang's back together.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.680
I don't wanna miss out
on anything.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.250
- Do you have any idea
what he actually does here?

02:01.250 --> 02:04.020
- Not even a little.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.960
- Hi, can I help you?

02:11.960 --> 02:13.900
- We're hoping to speak
with Audrey Grenelle.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.800
It's about a painting
in one of her collections.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.570
- I'm sorry,
Ms. Grenelle's not here.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.640
- Is there any way you could
get in touch with her for us?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.340
- Who are you, again?

02:21.340 --> 02:22.910
- Just fans.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.340
- We're just hoping
to talk to her,

02:24.340 --> 02:25.770
ask her a few questions.

02:25.770 --> 02:27.640
- I'm sure she'd appreciate
your interest,

02:27.640 --> 02:29.080
but she's an extremely busy
woman.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.680
I'm sorry I couldn't be
of help.

02:30.680 --> 02:31.980
- The painting is called
"The Path."

02:31.980 --> 02:33.250
It was part of
"The Future of Art" exhibit.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.280
I saw it at the Louvre.

02:35.580 --> 02:36.950
- Yeah, you're very lucky.

02:36.950 --> 02:39.590
That was a one-time exhibit,
very limited.

02:39.590 --> 02:40.920
- Yeah, I know.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.020
I travelled all the way
to Paris

02:42.020 --> 02:43.290
just to find that painting.

02:43.290 --> 02:45.630
Look, I know this
might sound crazy,

02:45.630 --> 02:48.200
but I think there's
a hidden message in it.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.830
I just wanna ask her
a few questions about it.

02:52.170 --> 02:54.240
- She'll be at the opening
tomorrow,

02:54.240 --> 02:55.670
but I'd get here early.

02:55.670 --> 02:56.940
She rarely stays long.

02:58.810 --> 03:00.610
- Looks like we're
about to meet

03:00.610 --> 03:01.910
the elusive Audrey Grenelle.

03:01.910 --> 03:03.950
- Yes, and when we do,

03:03.950 --> 03:07.250
maybe, finally,
we'll get some answers

03:07.250 --> 03:10.020
So, our Friend Suggestion,
Teddy Preston,

03:10.020 --> 03:12.090
is about to step out
in front of a packed house

03:12.090 --> 03:14.620
when his son shows up
and took the stage.

03:14.620 --> 03:15.890
- He did what?
Why?

03:15.890 --> 03:18.160
- I might have told him
everything.

03:19.230 --> 03:20.900
It worked out in the end.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.170
- I have to say,
I like your style.

03:23.170 --> 03:26.300
- Thank you.
Miles thinks I'm impulsive.

03:26.300 --> 03:27.870
- What?
Hey, no, no, no,

03:27.870 --> 03:29.510
I never said "impulsive."

03:30.210 --> 03:33.840
Okay, I did, but now,
I see the value

03:33.840 --> 03:35.240
of taking a risk.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.690
Did you get
a Friend Suggestion?

03:43.690 --> 03:47.190
- What?
Um, no, it's work, actually.

03:47.190 --> 03:48.590
They need me to fill in
for someone.

03:48.590 --> 03:49.690
Sorry, this has been great,

03:49.690 --> 03:51.790
but I really need the money.

03:51.790 --> 03:53.100
I'll see you guys later?
- Mm-hmm.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.800
- It was really good
to meet you, Cara.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.600
- Yeah, you too.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.140
- What?

04:01.140 --> 04:04.140
- Y'all catch that?
- Catch what?

04:04.140 --> 04:05.710
- Joy on her phone.

04:05.710 --> 04:07.480
I think she got
a Friend Suggestion.

04:08.240 --> 04:10.880
- Why would she lie to us?

04:10.880 --> 04:12.550
- I don't know,
but I'm telling you,

04:12.550 --> 04:13.850
I know that look.

04:13.850 --> 04:16.750
- Okay, Miles, if she got
a Friend Suggestion,

04:16.750 --> 04:18.020
she'd have told us, all right?

04:18.020 --> 04:19.290
This is probably
about her disbarment hearing

04:19.290 --> 04:20.890
back in Chicago.

04:20.890 --> 04:22.160
It's in a couple of days.
- Yeah, it's possible.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.290
- Miles, come on.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.230
Why wouldn't she tell us
if she got a Friend Suggestion?

04:25.230 --> 04:26.300
We're a team.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.300
- Maybe she doesn't wanna be

04:27.300 --> 04:28.830
a part of a team anymore.

04:28.830 --> 04:30.030
- Okay, she's only been
doing this, like, a month.

04:30.030 --> 04:31.300
I'm sure she still wants
your help.

04:31.300 --> 04:32.870
- Yeah, no, you don't know Joy.

04:32.870 --> 04:34.770
What if she thinks she's ready
to move on?

04:34.770 --> 04:36.040
What if she has moved on?

04:36.040 --> 04:37.940
Which means the time we spend

04:37.940 --> 04:41.280
helping Friend Suggestions
could be over.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.780
- Look, I know how much helping
these Friend Suggestions

04:44.780 --> 04:48.180
means to you, to all of us.

04:48.180 --> 04:50.190
So, maybe you should
just talk to Joy,

04:50.190 --> 04:51.850
see what she's thinking.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.130
- I'm so glad you were
able to reconnect with Annie.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.430
- Yeah, me too.

05:02.430 --> 05:05.530
- The fact that she took over
writing the book for you and...

05:05.530 --> 05:08.970
what a small, strange world
we live in sometimes.

05:08.970 --> 05:11.110
- Yeah, you get used to it
when you're dealing

05:11.110 --> 05:12.610
with the God Account.

05:12.610 --> 05:14.740
- Well, I'm glad
she's writing again,

05:14.740 --> 05:16.150
and I'm glad you're back.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.880
Oh, before I forget.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.920
Liv has a soccer game
this afternoon.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.580
I know it's last minute,
but is there any chance

05:22.580 --> 05:23.650
you could make it?

05:23.650 --> 05:25.550
I know she'd love to see you.

05:25.550 --> 05:26.890
- I'll be there.
- Great.

05:26.890 --> 05:28.720
So any news on the job hunt?

05:28.720 --> 05:29.760
- Not yet, no.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.300
- You just got back.
Work will figure itself out.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.930
- Yeah, hopefully,
my living situation will too.

05:35.930 --> 05:37.170
- What do you mean?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.070
- The woman who's subletting
my apartment

05:39.070 --> 05:41.100
can't move out early,
so looks like I'm living

05:41.100 --> 05:43.310
on Parker's couch
for the next few months.

05:43.310 --> 05:47.610
- You know, we have that
spare bedroom at the house.

05:47.610 --> 05:50.650
- Oh, I wouldn't wanna impose.

05:50.650 --> 05:51.910
- You wouldn't be.

05:51.910 --> 05:54.020
Oh, we would love to have you,
Cara.

05:54.920 --> 05:58.620
- Sorry, I shouldn't push.

05:59.890 --> 06:01.860
Just think about it, okay?

06:02.860 --> 06:04.730
- I will, thanks.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.270
- Hi, excuse me.
I'm a friend of Joy's.

06:15.270 --> 06:16.540
Is she here?

06:16.540 --> 06:17.810
- No, she's not working today.

06:19.810 --> 06:21.180
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

06:25.680 --> 06:27.080
- Hey, hey, Rakesh.

06:27.080 --> 06:30.590
- Miles, hey,
did you know that the Grenelles

06:30.590 --> 06:31.820
can trace their nobility back

06:31.820 --> 06:33.920
to the original court
of Louis XI?

06:33.920 --> 06:35.620
- Hey, Rakesh,
I appreciate the dive

06:35.620 --> 06:37.990
into the Grenelle family,
but I just swung by Joy's job,

06:37.990 --> 06:39.730
and she wasn't there.

06:39.730 --> 06:42.000
- Oh, so she did lie to us.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.770
Damn, uh, well, Miles,
maybe you were right

06:44.770 --> 06:45.830
about her getting
a Friend Suggestion.

06:45.830 --> 06:47.170
- Yeah, something's going on.

06:47.170 --> 06:49.040
- All right, just give me
a couple of minutes.

06:49.040 --> 06:50.810
I'll track her phone
and text you her location.

06:50.810 --> 06:51.840
- Okay.

07:05.590 --> 07:08.290
- What do you want, Miles?

07:08.290 --> 07:10.130
- Just wanna make sure
you're okay.

07:12.730 --> 07:13.860
Did you get a new
Friend Suggestion?

07:13.860 --> 07:14.960
- What does it matter?

07:14.960 --> 07:16.230
- It matters
'cause we're a team.

07:16.230 --> 07:18.270
Well, what happened to
our Obi-Wan-Luke thing

07:18.270 --> 07:19.770
we had going on?

07:19.770 --> 07:21.640
- I release you
from your obligation.

07:21.640 --> 07:22.840
- It's not an obligation.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.240
We're friends.
I want to help.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.610
You barely know me, Miles.

07:26.610 --> 07:28.010
- That's not true.

07:28.010 --> 07:30.050
We are the only two people
in the entire world

07:30.050 --> 07:31.610
who understand
what it feels like

07:31.610 --> 07:33.280
to have this responsibility.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.050
If you wanna do this
on your own,

07:35.050 --> 07:39.920
I get it,
but be honest with me.

07:41.590 --> 07:43.030
- Yes.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.230
I got a Friend Suggestion,

07:45.230 --> 07:47.660
but that's not why
I lied to you.

07:47.660 --> 07:51.900
I...I don't wanna do this
on my own.

07:52.770 --> 07:54.570
In fact, right now,
I don't even think

07:54.570 --> 07:55.770
that I can do this at all.

07:55.770 --> 07:58.140
- Why?
Who's the Friend Suggestion?

08:02.280 --> 08:03.780
My daughter.

08:15.420 --> 08:17.460
- The whole reason
I gave her up

08:17.460 --> 08:19.290
was so that she could have
a better life,

08:19.290 --> 08:21.200
so that could be happy.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.200
And up until now, I thought
I made the right choice,

08:23.200 --> 08:25.130
but now that the God Account
sent me her name--

08:25.130 --> 08:26.430
- Hey, Joy--Joy.

08:26.430 --> 08:29.170
We don't even know
what her problem is.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.570
There is no reason to jump
to worst-case scenario.

08:31.570 --> 08:32.940
- Really?

08:32.940 --> 08:34.180
'Cause it sort of feels
that way.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.910
- Joy, come on.
Miles is right.

08:36.910 --> 08:39.110
We just need to figure out
what's going on in her life

08:39.110 --> 08:41.480
and fix it,
like we always do.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.950
- We have a pretty good
track record.

08:43.950 --> 08:45.450
She's gonna be fine.

08:47.890 --> 08:49.620
- So where do we start?

08:49.620 --> 08:51.460
- Allow me.

08:52.290 --> 08:54.300
Hmm, she's 13, which means

08:54.300 --> 08:56.030
she just got
a Facebook account,

08:56.030 --> 08:57.430
which means
it's a shiny new toy,

08:57.430 --> 09:00.530
which means she's probably
on it all the time.

09:00.530 --> 09:02.570
All right, let's see
what we got here.

09:02.570 --> 09:05.540
Looks like she helps out
at her parents' grocery store

09:05.540 --> 09:08.240
and a couple of posts
about how much homework

09:08.240 --> 09:10.140
Mr. Lindenburgh is giving.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.020
- Wait, Rakesh,
pull up that soccer photo.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.890
That's my sister, Liv.

09:18.890 --> 09:21.560
- Normally, I'd say
that's a crazy coincidence,

09:21.560 --> 09:24.020
but this is the God Account
we're dealing with.

09:24.020 --> 09:25.590
- They have a soccer game
this afternoon.

09:25.590 --> 09:27.060
I was gonna meet my mom there.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.100
- There's probably
a good chance

09:28.100 --> 09:29.330
her parents will be there too.

09:29.330 --> 09:30.560
We can go down there,
talk to 'em,

09:30.560 --> 09:31.600
and see what we can find out.

09:33.570 --> 09:35.000
- Soccer it is.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.410
- Now, there is no
going back now,

09:38.410 --> 09:40.940
because we've
already signed you up.

09:40.940 --> 09:41.940
- Trish, I don't know
about this.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.240
- Signed up for what?

09:43.240 --> 09:45.180
- Your father mentioned
that he always wanted

09:45.180 --> 09:46.410
to take tennis lessons.

09:46.410 --> 09:48.380
- One off-hand comment.
One.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.580
- Dad, that sounds like fun.
What's the problem?

09:50.580 --> 09:52.190
- I don't know.

09:52.190 --> 09:54.390
It just feels like something
that retired people do.

09:54.390 --> 09:58.190
- Well, I sold my music in,
and you left the church.

09:58.190 --> 10:00.930
I think that's the definition
of retirement.

10:00.930 --> 10:03.330
- Oop, she got you there.

10:03.330 --> 10:04.370
- Thank you.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.900
- Arthur.
- Oh.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.070
- Sorry to interrupt.
I just wanted to say hello.

10:10.070 --> 10:12.240
- Bishop Thompson,
what a pleasant surprise.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.070
I'm sure you remember
my fiancée, Trish,

10:14.070 --> 10:15.410
and my daughter, Ali.

10:15.410 --> 10:17.540
- Of course.
Good to see you both again.

10:17.540 --> 10:18.950
Do you have a minute?

10:18.950 --> 10:22.380
- Um...absolutely.

10:23.220 --> 10:24.450
So, what did you wanna
talk about?

10:24.450 --> 10:27.620
- I came down here
hoping for some advice.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.090
- Oh, about what?

10:29.090 --> 10:32.230
- It's my counterpart
in the Western Diocese.

10:32.230 --> 10:34.960
- Bishop Roberts, good man.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.200
- Good, but tough.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.530
- Well, he has his own opinions
about things.

10:40.530 --> 10:42.040
- I'm trying to take

10:42.040 --> 10:44.510
our Social Justice
Ministry Program statewide,

10:44.510 --> 10:47.510
and I can't get Roberts
to sign on.

10:48.410 --> 10:50.080
- You know,
it's been my experience

10:50.080 --> 10:51.510
that if you wanna get
Roberts to hear you,

10:51.510 --> 10:52.210
don't talk to him.

10:52.210 --> 10:54.380
Talk to Reverend Mary Pearson.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.020
- The Bishop Assistant.
- Mm-hmm.

10:57.020 --> 10:59.250
Yeah, they go way back.
She is the Roberts whisperer.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.860
If you can get Mary on board,
then you're home free.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.590
She and I are old friends.

11:03.590 --> 11:05.190
I mean, if you'd like,

11:05.190 --> 11:06.530
I'd be happy
to give her a call.

11:06.530 --> 11:09.860
- That would be fantastic.
Thank you, thank you.

11:09.860 --> 11:11.130
- My pleasure.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.270
Hmm.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.310
- All right, guys, let's focus.
Focus.

11:19.310 --> 11:21.940
Pull out some energy, guys.
Come on.

11:21.940 --> 11:23.110
Let's have fun!

11:23.110 --> 11:24.350
- Are you okay?
- Let's have fun.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.480
It's all about having fun,
remember?

11:25.480 --> 11:26.650
Come on.
- She's right over there.

11:26.650 --> 11:27.650
- Concentrate.
Hey.

11:27.650 --> 11:29.350
- Number nine.

11:29.350 --> 11:31.350
Okay.

11:31.350 --> 11:33.450
All right, look, Joy,
I know this is a lot.

11:33.450 --> 11:35.090
If you want to,
you can hang back,

11:35.090 --> 11:36.490
and we can talk to her parents.

11:36.490 --> 11:38.190
- No, I'll be fine.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.960
I need to do this.
I need to meet them.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.900
- Keep your head down,
head down.

11:44.030 --> 11:46.430
- Cara, oh,
I'm so glad you came.

11:46.430 --> 11:49.170
- Yeah, of course.
- Miles, great to see you.

11:49.170 --> 11:51.140
- You too,
this is my friend Joy.

11:51.140 --> 11:53.440
- Hi, I'm Susan,
nice to meet you.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.580
- Same.

11:54.580 --> 11:55.940
- Well, Liv will be happy.

11:55.940 --> 11:57.340
She's got her own
cheering section.

11:57.340 --> 11:59.550
- Uh, actually,
there's another reason

11:59.550 --> 12:00.910
why we're all here.

12:00.910 --> 12:03.520
We're kind of working
a Friend Suggestion.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.850
- For Lauren Brooks.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.190
I know Lauren's family well.

12:07.190 --> 12:10.120
She's a great kid.
Any idea what's wrong?

12:10.120 --> 12:12.890
- No, but we were sort of
hoping you could introduce us

12:12.890 --> 12:15.530
to her parents, you know,
minus the God Account part.

12:15.530 --> 12:17.930
- Of course.
They're right over there.

12:17.930 --> 12:20.000
Her dad's actually the coach.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.570
- Erica.
- Oh, sorry.

12:21.570 --> 12:22.600
I'll be right back.

12:22.600 --> 12:26.070
- David.
- Hey.

12:26.070 --> 12:27.540
- Hey, Susan.

12:27.540 --> 12:29.140
Hey, thanks again for bringing
drinks for the girls.

12:29.140 --> 12:30.510
- Oh, absolutely.

12:30.510 --> 12:32.910
I wanted to introduce you
to my daughter, Cara,

12:32.910 --> 12:34.380
and her friends Miles and Joy.

12:34.380 --> 12:35.980
- Oh, nice to meet you guys.
- Good to meet you.

12:35.980 --> 12:37.620
- Nice to meet you.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.120
- Susan's the best.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.050
She's kind of our unofficial
team mom.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.230
Anyway, I gotta get back,
game's almost starting.

12:46.260 --> 12:48.530
- Oh, it must be pretty cool
to have her dad as a coach.

12:48.530 --> 12:50.460
- Oh, David played soccer
in college.

12:50.460 --> 12:53.070
Truthfully, it's not Lauren's
favorite sport,

12:53.070 --> 12:54.400
but she knows how much
it means to him.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.370
It's something
they can share together.

12:56.370 --> 12:59.370
- They must be really close.
- They are.

12:59.370 --> 13:00.540
- Well, I wouldn't have
missed the pass

13:00.540 --> 13:01.580
if you hadn't sucked.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.580
- It's your fault
you missed it.

13:02.580 --> 13:04.080
Don't blame me.

13:05.450 --> 13:07.210
- Okay, everyone, timeout!

13:07.210 --> 13:08.520
Lauren, you're on the bench
to start the game.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.880
- It's her fault.
- I said, on the bench.

13:10.880 --> 13:11.920
- You know what?
Forget it.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.520
I don't wanna play anyway.

13:14.520 --> 13:16.020
- I am so sorry.

13:16.020 --> 13:17.420
I don't know what's gotten
into her lately.

13:17.420 --> 13:19.890
Excuse me.

13:19.890 --> 13:21.060
- Has that happened before?

13:21.060 --> 13:22.300
- Never.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.570
- Well, clearly,
something's going on.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.170
- Cara.
I'm glad you came.

13:29.170 --> 13:31.140
- Hey, of course.
I wouldn't miss it.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.210
- Hi, Miles.
- Hey.

13:32.210 --> 13:33.870
Uh, is everything okay?

13:33.870 --> 13:34.980
- I don't know.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.080
Lauren just hasn't been herself

13:36.080 --> 13:37.180
over the past few weeks.

13:37.180 --> 13:38.480
- Do you know why?
- No.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.080
She wouldn't talk to us
about it,

13:40.080 --> 13:41.220
but she got detention
the other day

13:41.220 --> 13:42.580
for arguing with her teacher.

13:42.580 --> 13:45.950
She's usually the best student
in the class.

13:45.950 --> 13:46.990
Teenagers, I guess.

13:48.220 --> 13:51.120
I gotta go.
I'll see you guys later.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.960
Oh, and Cara, Mom said
you might stay with us.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.460
You totally should.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.440
- I'm just gonna...go check
on Erica.

14:05.440 --> 14:07.170
- It sounds like up until
a few weeks ago,

14:07.170 --> 14:08.980
everything in Lauren's life
was going fine.

14:08.980 --> 14:12.180
- Yeah, we need to find out
what happened that change that.

14:17.220 --> 14:18.320
- I've been going over
Lauren's Facebook posts

14:18.320 --> 14:20.090
from the last couple of weeks,

14:20.090 --> 14:22.190
and there's really nothing
out of the ordinary.

14:22.190 --> 14:23.460
- Well, keep looking.

14:23.460 --> 14:25.590
There must be something
that stands out.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.900
Hey, you okay?

14:31.300 --> 14:36.000
- Yeah, it's just seeing her,
her family.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.600
It's a lot.

14:37.600 --> 14:38.870
- We'll figure it out.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.910
- Uh, guys, you might--
you might wanna see this.

14:45.910 --> 14:48.420
Looks like Lauren joined
a closed Facebook group

14:48.420 --> 14:49.450
for adopted kids.

14:49.450 --> 14:50.150
- Okay, and?

14:50.150 --> 14:51.920
- And there's a thread on how

14:51.920 --> 14:53.620
to secretly order
a 23andMe test.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.120
And based on comments,
it looks like she ordered one

14:56.120 --> 14:57.660
about three weeks ago,
and she's waiting

14:57.660 --> 14:59.660
for the results.

14:59.660 --> 15:01.160
- That's what this is about,

15:01.160 --> 15:03.100
why she's been acting out
the last few weeks.

15:05.270 --> 15:07.030
- She's looking for me.

15:13.440 --> 15:16.410
- Joy, are you okay?
- Yeah.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.110
It's just we've been trying
to figure out

15:18.110 --> 15:20.210
what Lauren's problem is,
and this whole time,

15:20.210 --> 15:21.550
I've been the answer.

15:21.550 --> 15:23.950
- You've never taken
a 23andMe test, have you?

15:23.950 --> 15:26.520
- No, so there's no way
she can find me.

15:28.590 --> 15:30.020
I need to talk to her.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.360
- Whoa, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.930
Joy, Joy, let's slow down
for a second, okay?

15:32.930 --> 15:34.030
She's 13.

15:34.030 --> 15:35.130
You can't just walk up to her

15:35.130 --> 15:36.130
and tell her who you are.

15:36.130 --> 15:37.500
- Why not?

15:37.500 --> 15:38.970
This is clearly
what the God Account wants.

15:38.970 --> 15:40.130
- The God Account or you?

15:42.070 --> 15:43.600
- Contrary to what you think,
Miles,

15:43.600 --> 15:46.410
I had no intention of ever
telling my daughter who I was.

15:46.410 --> 15:49.480
I only came out here
to make sure she was okay.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.110
- So, why did you stay?

15:52.110 --> 15:53.950
You said it yourself.

15:53.950 --> 15:55.250
When you first saw her,
she was happy.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.450
But instead of going back
to Chicago

15:57.450 --> 15:59.350
and fighting
to get your life back,

15:59.350 --> 16:02.120
you stayed and got a job
as a waitress.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.020
So, you're telling me
that's not wanting

16:04.020 --> 16:05.990
to have a relationship
with your daughter?

16:06.990 --> 16:08.590
- Miles...

16:08.590 --> 16:10.900
- No, he's right.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.160
Deep down,
this is what I wanted,

16:12.160 --> 16:14.530
but it doesn't mean
that I'm wrong.

16:16.140 --> 16:20.070
- Look, Joy, I wanna help you
more than anyone.

16:20.070 --> 16:23.010
A year ago, the God Account
put me face-to-face

16:23.010 --> 16:24.180
with my own past.

16:24.180 --> 16:27.180
I know how hard this can be,

16:27.180 --> 16:29.350
but I wanna make sure
that you're going about it

16:29.350 --> 16:30.550
the right way.

16:30.550 --> 16:34.420
You go behind her parents' back
and tell Lauren who you are,

16:34.420 --> 16:36.490
it could rip their family
apart.

16:39.930 --> 16:43.330
- Of course I don't want that,

16:43.330 --> 16:45.800
but what else
am I supposed to do?

16:46.470 --> 16:48.330
- We talk to her parents,
see if they would be open

16:48.330 --> 16:51.070
to Lauren meeting with you,
go from there.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.210
- Yeah, that makes sense, Joy.

16:53.210 --> 16:54.470
I mean,
you guys said it yourself.

16:54.470 --> 16:56.380
Her parents seem pretty nice,
right?

16:56.380 --> 16:58.340
Well,
maybe they'll be open to it.

16:59.380 --> 17:01.350
- Fine.

17:01.350 --> 17:04.450
Tomorrow, we'll go down
to her parents' grocery store

17:04.450 --> 17:05.920
and talk to them.

17:05.920 --> 17:09.560
- Okay, we'll see you
tomorrow.

17:09.560 --> 17:10.860
- Hey, hold up.

17:10.860 --> 17:11.990
You can give me a lift
back home

17:11.990 --> 17:13.990
providing that your car

17:13.990 --> 17:16.300
hasn't been ticketed again.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.840
- Nothing can ever be easy
with the God Account, can it?

17:24.840 --> 17:26.410
- Oh, no.

17:27.610 --> 17:28.910
Well, it's late.

17:28.910 --> 17:30.140
I should probably get going
too.

17:30.140 --> 17:31.510
I don't want Parker
to give away my spot

17:31.510 --> 17:32.510
on her couch.

17:32.510 --> 17:34.310
- Oh, so I take it

17:34.310 --> 17:36.050
you're not moving in
with your mom.

17:36.050 --> 17:38.120
- I don't see the upside.

17:39.220 --> 17:41.990
- Well, you know you can
stay here.

17:41.990 --> 17:44.360
- Thanks, but I don't wanna

17:44.360 --> 17:45.620
put that kind of pressure
on us.

17:45.620 --> 17:48.360
I think things are perfect
as is.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.000
- So do I.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.470
I mean, besides,

17:52.470 --> 17:54.000
I don't have enough
closet space for you, anyways.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.900
- Okay, shoes are important.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.870
- Hey.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.440
I'm glad that you're back.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.350
- So am I.

18:13.790 --> 18:15.390
- Spoke with Mary Pearson
last night.

18:15.390 --> 18:17.820
I sold her on the merits
of your program.

18:17.820 --> 18:18.820
She agrees.

18:18.820 --> 18:21.660
- I can't thank you enough.
This is great news.

18:21.660 --> 18:23.800
- Well, my pleasure.

18:23.800 --> 18:27.370
I'm happy to help the church
any way I can.

18:27.370 --> 18:29.530
- You know, Arthur,

18:29.530 --> 18:31.770
I could use a mind like yours
on my staff.

18:31.770 --> 18:34.070
- I appreciate that.
- No, I'm serious.

18:34.070 --> 18:35.410
I've been looking for

18:35.410 --> 18:36.780
a chief of staff
for some time now,

18:36.780 --> 18:40.780
someone to help me navigate
the political waters.

18:40.780 --> 18:44.020
And I think the answer
finally presented itself.

18:46.350 --> 18:47.620
- What do you say?

18:47.620 --> 18:49.960
- I don't know.

18:49.960 --> 18:54.590
I'm flattered, but I just
retired from the church,

18:54.590 --> 18:57.460
and Trish and I are
planning our wedding.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.830
- But you're interested?

19:04.770 --> 19:06.510
I have to talk to Trish first.

19:06.510 --> 19:08.710
- Of course.
It's a big decision.

19:08.710 --> 19:10.980
Take all the time you need.

19:17.820 --> 19:19.450
- Come here
and when you're done,

19:19.450 --> 19:20.590
can you do the vegetables,
please?

19:20.590 --> 19:23.520
- There's Lauren's dad.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.520
- You ready?
- Nope.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.890
That's why I have you two.

19:28.690 --> 19:31.830
- Mr. Brooks.
It's Cara, Liv's sister.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.100
We met yesterday.
- Of course.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.630
Good to see you again.

19:34.630 --> 19:36.400
- Yeah, it's a great store
you have here.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.640
- Thank you, largest selection
of vegan and gluten-free items

19:38.640 --> 19:39.710
in the city.

19:39.710 --> 19:40.910
- I'm gluten-free myself.

19:40.910 --> 19:42.810
It's a smart business to be in.

19:42.810 --> 19:44.840
- True, my daughter can't have
gluten either.

19:44.840 --> 19:46.610
She was adopted,
and since we don't know

19:46.610 --> 19:47.810
her family's medical history,

19:47.810 --> 19:49.080
we err
on the side of caution.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.750
That's why I started
carrying it all here.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.590
- That's really great
that you would do that for her.

19:53.590 --> 19:54.920
- Thanks.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.820
- So, um, what brings you guys
down here?

20:00.730 --> 20:03.700
- Well, um, here's the thing.

20:03.700 --> 20:05.700
- We're not done talking
about this, Lauren.

20:05.700 --> 20:06.700
- Yes, we are, Mom.

20:06.700 --> 20:07.830
- What's going on?

20:07.830 --> 20:10.470
- Lauren took
a DNA test.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.840
Why didn't you come to us?
- And what would you have said?

20:12.840 --> 20:14.910
- Well, I don't know,
but going behind our back,

20:14.910 --> 20:17.380
using our credit card,
you had to know

20:17.380 --> 20:18.710
we'd find out eventually.

20:18.710 --> 20:20.550
- Look, I think we should
talk about this later.

20:20.550 --> 20:21.850
- Did you know about this,
David?

20:21.850 --> 20:23.880
- I just found out last week.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.520
She made me promise
not to say anything

20:25.520 --> 20:26.550
until she got the results back.

20:26.550 --> 20:28.020
She didn't want to upset you.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.590
- I'm sorry, Mom.

20:30.590 --> 20:32.460
I didn't wanna hurt
your feelings.

20:32.460 --> 20:34.730
I just wanna know
where I come from

20:36.630 --> 20:39.100
- Look, I'm sorry to interrupt,

20:39.100 --> 20:41.900
but I think
I can help with that.

20:41.900 --> 20:44.600
- What are you talking about?

20:44.600 --> 20:47.670
- Uh, well, Joy is a lawyer.

20:47.670 --> 20:50.110
So if you do decide
that you want to find

20:50.110 --> 20:52.740
her birth parents,
she can help you.

20:53.710 --> 20:55.010
Right, Joy?

20:57.180 --> 20:59.950
- That would be amazing.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.020
Mom, Dad?

21:03.990 --> 21:05.490
- We'll see.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.530
- Which means "no."

21:16.370 --> 21:17.440
- Joy!

21:17.440 --> 21:20.040
Joy!
Come on, Joy!

21:20.840 --> 21:21.840
- You had no right to do that.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.740
- Joy, look, I understand

21:23.740 --> 21:25.140
that you're upset right now,
but telling Lauren who you were

21:25.140 --> 21:26.810
wasn't a part of the plan.

21:26.810 --> 21:28.450
- You mean,
it wasn't part of your plan.

21:28.450 --> 21:30.720
- No, Joy, her parents weren't
on the same page.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.850
If you would have told Lauren
who you were,

21:32.850 --> 21:34.390
it would have
made things worse.

21:34.390 --> 21:36.460
- For who?
Not for Lauren.

21:36.460 --> 21:39.720
Because all I heard back there
was a girl who was desperate

21:39.720 --> 21:42.130
to find out who she was
and desperate for answers

21:42.130 --> 21:43.600
that only I can give her.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.730
- And there will be
a time for that,

21:44.730 --> 21:46.000
just not right now.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.970
- Then when?

21:47.970 --> 21:52.700
Maybe her parents get
on the same page eventually,

21:52.700 --> 21:54.570
but maybe they don't.

21:54.570 --> 21:55.810
I'm not gonna sit back

21:55.810 --> 21:57.080
and watch
Lauren's life fall apart.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.610
I can't.
- Joy--

21:58.610 --> 22:00.750
- No, Miles, this is
my Friend Suggestion.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.010
It's not yours.

22:02.010 --> 22:03.650
You don't get them anymore,
remember?

22:08.050 --> 22:09.890
Look...

22:09.890 --> 22:13.560
you have your path,
and I have mine.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.690
I think it's time
we go our separate ways.

22:26.200 --> 22:28.470
- So, you think Joy's gonna
tell her daughter who she is?

22:28.470 --> 22:29.640
- Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

22:29.640 --> 22:30.740
- Yeah,
she seems pretty determined.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.410
- Joy is at work until tonight,

22:32.410 --> 22:34.610
which means we have
to figure out how to stop her

22:34.610 --> 22:36.150
from telling Lauren
before she gets off.

22:36.150 --> 22:37.980
- Well, are you sure that's
what we're supposed to do?

22:37.980 --> 22:39.950
Because the God Account
did send her Lauren's name.

22:39.950 --> 22:41.850
- Yeah, and forcing people
to face their past

22:41.850 --> 22:43.550
is sort of a God Account go to.

22:43.550 --> 22:46.460
- Yeah, but not at the expense
of destroying a family.

22:46.460 --> 22:49.530
Look, I get how emotional
this must be for Joy,

22:49.530 --> 22:50.730
but she needs
to think this through.

22:50.730 --> 22:52.100
- Well, Miles, maybe she has.

22:52.100 --> 22:54.400
She gave up her entire life
six months ago

22:54.400 --> 22:56.730
to come here and make sure
her daughter was okay.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.840
You don't just do that
on a whim.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.540
- Yeah.

23:02.540 --> 23:03.770
Actually, you're right.

23:03.770 --> 23:07.510
- Thank you...about what,
exactly?

23:07.510 --> 23:10.450
- Joy had an amazing life
back in Chicago,

23:10.450 --> 23:12.680
so why would she
all of a sudden decide

23:12.680 --> 23:13.980
to give it up six months ago?

23:13.980 --> 23:15.950
- Well, because she wanted
to find her daughter.

23:15.950 --> 23:19.020
- No, no, no, I get that,
but why not six years ago

23:19.020 --> 23:20.760
or six days ago?

23:20.760 --> 23:22.990
What if something happened
in Joy's life

23:22.990 --> 23:25.100
that triggered her
to come looking for Lauren?

23:25.100 --> 23:27.670
Triggered her
to unseal the records

23:27.670 --> 23:28.970
and implode her entire life.

23:28.970 --> 23:30.600
- Whatever it was could be
a part of this,

23:30.600 --> 23:31.900
a part of what's driving her.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.570
- Yeah, if we can figure out
what it is,

23:33.570 --> 23:34.710
then maybe we can
get through to her.

23:34.710 --> 23:37.070
Buy some time to help Lauren

23:37.070 --> 23:39.410
without Joy having to tell her
who she is.

23:39.410 --> 23:42.980
Could you look into Joy and see
if anything stands out

23:42.980 --> 23:43.980
from six months ago?

23:43.980 --> 23:44.820
- Yeah, I'm on it.

23:44.820 --> 23:46.850
- Oh,
what about the gallery opening?

23:46.850 --> 23:49.750
- Oh, right, um, well,
we have a few hours.

23:49.750 --> 23:50.920
Why don't we all meet
at my house

23:50.920 --> 23:52.490
and we'll head down together?

23:52.490 --> 23:53.490
- Perfect, I have to meet up
with my mom,

23:53.490 --> 23:54.530
but I'll see you there.

23:54.530 --> 23:56.160
- Yeah.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.000
- So, Lauren's looking
for her birth parents.

23:59.000 --> 23:59.860
Do Erica and David know?

23:59.860 --> 24:02.730
- Yeah,
and they're not taking it well.

24:02.730 --> 24:04.440
- Is that what the God Account
wants you to do,

24:04.440 --> 24:05.600
find Lauren's birth parents?

24:05.600 --> 24:07.710
- I don't know.
I hope not.

24:07.710 --> 24:10.340
Her parents have been
by her side

24:10.340 --> 24:11.480
every day of her life.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.740
That is what is important.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.580
I didn't mean anything by that.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.680
- I know,
and it's okay if you did.

24:20.780 --> 24:23.520
I would never pretend I was
there for you growing up, Cara.

24:23.520 --> 24:24.760
That's why I thought
it'd be nice

24:24.760 --> 24:26.820
for you to come
and stay with us.

24:28.060 --> 24:29.890
- I just--I don't think
it's a good idea.

24:29.890 --> 24:31.900
- I get
you have reservations,

24:31.900 --> 24:33.700
but maybe if we spent
some more time together,

24:33.700 --> 24:36.070
we could just hit
some of this stuff head-on.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.570
- We've just come so far
in the last year,

24:40.570 --> 24:43.840
I don't wanna risk taking
a step back.

24:45.110 --> 24:47.980
- Families are a lot stronger
than we think, Cara.

24:47.980 --> 24:50.780
You said you don't see
how Lauren's family survives

24:50.780 --> 24:54.450
if her birth parents
are in the picture.

24:54.450 --> 24:56.990
But sometimes facing
who we are

24:56.990 --> 24:58.890
and risking what change
that might bring

24:58.890 --> 25:03.660
is what makes us stronger,
makes us closer.

25:03.660 --> 25:06.100
I bet Erica, David, and Lauren
come out of this

25:06.100 --> 25:09.670
a stronger family for having
faced it together.

25:11.800 --> 25:16.040
- Anyway, Bishop Thompson was
very appreciative.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.510
- I'm glad.

25:17.510 --> 25:20.510
- In fact,
he was so appreciative,

25:20.510 --> 25:22.050
that he offered me a job.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.850
- I don't understand.
What kind of job?

25:26.850 --> 25:29.920
- Well, basically,
doing what I did today,

25:29.920 --> 25:32.820
helping him navigate
the politics of the church.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.430
- And what did you tell him?

25:35.430 --> 25:40.000
- I told him that I needed...

25:41.130 --> 25:42.700
To talk to you first.

25:44.130 --> 25:46.500
- So are you considering this?

25:46.500 --> 25:48.770
- Well, maybe.

25:48.770 --> 25:51.710
If I'm being honest,
I'm not sure I'm cut out

25:51.710 --> 25:53.710
for retirement the way
other people are.

25:53.710 --> 25:55.450
I mean, I love having the time

25:55.450 --> 25:57.680
to play chess
and take a stroll...

25:57.680 --> 25:59.450
- Well,
I love that we get to spend

25:59.450 --> 26:02.950
so much more time together,
and I don't wanna change that.

26:02.950 --> 26:04.420
- Me either.

26:04.420 --> 26:07.830
It's just it felt good
doing something

26:07.830 --> 26:12.000
in the church again,
to have a higher purpose.

26:13.400 --> 26:14.730
- I understand that.

26:14.730 --> 26:17.600
- And I'm sure I know
what you're thinking.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.940
This wouldn't be like running
Harlem Episcopal.

26:19.940 --> 26:24.340
It could be something...

26:24.340 --> 26:25.340
I just do.

26:25.340 --> 26:26.910
- Arthur, we both know

26:26.910 --> 26:30.580
there has never been anything
in your life you "just do."

26:31.750 --> 26:33.880
When you care about something,

26:33.880 --> 26:36.890
you give your whole self
over to it.

26:36.890 --> 26:41.860
I was just hoping that
this next chapter of our lives

26:41.860 --> 26:46.460
was gonna be about us finding
a new purpose together.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.970
Is that okay?
- Of course.

26:49.970 --> 26:53.540
I'll talk to Bishop Thompson
and tell him

26:53.540 --> 26:54.710
I'm not gonna take the job.

26:56.840 --> 26:58.880
- I know what happened
six months ago,

26:58.880 --> 27:01.580
why Joy felt so compelled
to go looking for Lauren.

27:07.580 --> 27:08.790
- Who's that?

27:08.790 --> 27:11.620
- That is Joy's grandfather
Kai.

27:11.620 --> 27:13.520
He died a couple of weeks
before Joy unsealed

27:13.520 --> 27:15.430
Lauren's adoption records.

27:15.430 --> 27:16.790
- "To Grandpa Kai,

27:16.790 --> 27:18.660
"the only family
I've ever known.

27:18.660 --> 27:20.930
I will feel your loss always."

27:20.930 --> 27:22.400
- It makes sense.

27:22.400 --> 27:23.970
After losing
the only family she has,

27:23.970 --> 27:25.400
she decides
there's only one person

27:25.400 --> 27:26.540
that can fill that void.

27:26.540 --> 27:29.470
- Lauren.
- I gotta talk to Joy.

27:29.470 --> 27:31.810
- Hey, Miles,
what about the gallery opening?

27:31.810 --> 27:33.110
I mean, we don't know how long

27:33.110 --> 27:34.550
Audrey Grenelle's gonna
be there.

27:34.550 --> 27:37.280
- You're right.
I'll meet you there.

27:44.590 --> 27:46.860
We need to talk.

27:48.090 --> 27:51.230
If I said "no,"
would it matter?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.100
- I know you lost
your grandfather

27:57.100 --> 27:59.200
six months ago.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.070
- Yeah, so what?

28:02.070 --> 28:04.540
- I read the tribute
that you wrote about him.

28:04.540 --> 28:06.380
Sounds like an amazing guy.

28:06.380 --> 28:08.240
- He was.

28:12.420 --> 28:15.390
He grew up in Hawaii.

28:15.390 --> 28:17.890
Oh, he was
an incredible surfer.

28:20.890 --> 28:22.330
My parents split
when I was young,

28:22.330 --> 28:25.200
and he moved to Chicago
and raised me on his own.

28:25.200 --> 28:29.130
When I got pregnant
and decided I wasn't

28:29.130 --> 28:31.430
ready to be a mother...

28:34.500 --> 28:36.940
He was so supportive.

28:36.940 --> 28:40.280
He told me...

28:40.280 --> 28:45.050
that giving her up didn't mean
that I didn't love her.

28:45.050 --> 28:46.480
It meant that
I loved her enough

28:46.480 --> 28:48.620
to make sure she could have
the best life possible...

28:51.450 --> 28:56.160
The life that...

28:56.160 --> 28:58.030
I couldn't give her back then.

28:58.030 --> 29:00.200
- And he was right.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.470
Lauren has a great life
with parents who love her.

29:03.470 --> 29:05.140
- I know that.

29:05.140 --> 29:06.840
You think I wanna hurt them,

29:06.840 --> 29:09.010
that I don't understand
what telling Lauren might do?

29:09.010 --> 29:11.170
But she's looking for me.

29:11.170 --> 29:15.510
She wants to know who she is;
where she comes from.

29:20.550 --> 29:24.220
I won't turn my back on her
again, Miles.

29:24.220 --> 29:26.420
I can't.

29:26.420 --> 29:29.490
This is my chance to finally
give her what she needs.

29:36.400 --> 29:39.570
- Hey, Rakesh,
now is not a good time.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.300
- Are you with Joy?

29:42.310 --> 29:43.170
- Yeah, why?

29:43.170 --> 29:44.310
- Well, I got a ping

29:44.310 --> 29:46.040
on that Facebook group
Lauren joined,

29:46.040 --> 29:49.380
and she's got the results back
from her 23andMe test.

29:49.380 --> 29:51.310
There's been match.

29:51.310 --> 29:53.220
Some third cousin,
he lives in Chicago.

29:53.220 --> 29:55.520
Problem is,
she's headed there now.

29:55.520 --> 29:58.220
- What do you mean?
To Chicago?

29:58.220 --> 29:59.360
- Yeah, yeah,
she bought a bus ticket

29:59.360 --> 30:01.190
with her dad's credit card.

30:01.190 --> 30:02.490
We were gonna call them,
but they live uptown,

30:02.490 --> 30:03.960
and you guys are closer
to the station.

30:03.960 --> 30:04.990
- I'm gonna send you
the address,

30:04.990 --> 30:06.260
but you gotta hurry, Miles.

30:06.260 --> 30:07.360
It leaves in, like,
half an hour.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.030
- Okay,
you get Lauren's parents

30:09.030 --> 30:10.030
and meet us there.

30:10.030 --> 30:12.100
- Miles, Audrey Grenelle is

30:12.100 --> 30:13.440
supposed to be here any minute.

30:14.570 --> 30:16.140
This is our only chance.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.410
- I know,
but this is more important.

30:29.090 --> 30:31.820
Come on,
let's go get your daughter.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.540
- Hey, There she is.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.000
- Wait, Miles, wait.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.910
I need to do this alone.

30:49.910 --> 30:51.440
- Wait, do--do what?

30:51.440 --> 30:53.010
I thought we were
coming down here

30:53.010 --> 30:54.610
to make sure she doesn't
get on that bus.

30:54.610 --> 30:57.080
- We are.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.650
You need to trust me.

31:00.950 --> 31:02.220
- Joy!

31:12.130 --> 31:14.430
- Hey, Lauren.

31:14.430 --> 31:17.500
- You're the lawyer.
- Joy.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.130
Mind if I sit?

31:24.340 --> 31:27.610
- What are you doing here,
anyway?

31:27.610 --> 31:29.210
Wait, did my parents send you?

31:29.210 --> 31:33.480
- No, but they know
you're here,

31:33.480 --> 31:35.080
and they know why.

31:35.080 --> 31:37.050
- No, they don't.

31:37.050 --> 31:39.390
They don't understand
why I need to do this.

31:39.390 --> 31:41.360
- Why do you?

31:43.030 --> 31:45.190
Why do you have to know?

31:45.190 --> 31:47.500
- Because I don't know
who I am.

31:50.030 --> 31:52.370
Well, not really.

31:52.370 --> 31:55.100
I mean...

31:55.100 --> 31:57.110
I really love my parents,

31:57.110 --> 32:01.580
but I don't know anything
about where I come from

32:01.580 --> 32:03.550
or who my relatives were.

32:03.550 --> 32:06.380
- And you think some
distant cousin is going to help

32:06.380 --> 32:07.380
fill that in?

32:07.380 --> 32:09.180
- It's something.

32:09.180 --> 32:11.450
I would take anything
over not knowing.

32:17.490 --> 32:19.560
- I think I can help you
with that.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.870
- What do you mean?

32:31.970 --> 32:33.910
- Who is it?

32:35.310 --> 32:39.210
- That is
your great-grandfather.

32:39.210 --> 32:41.950
- My great-grandfather?

32:43.550 --> 32:45.290
Really?

32:45.290 --> 32:47.390
- His name was Kai.

32:49.490 --> 32:52.960
He passed away last year,
but I did some research.

32:52.960 --> 32:56.500
Turns out,
he was kinda famous...

32:56.500 --> 32:58.230
at least, in Hawaii.

32:59.030 --> 33:01.240
- My DNA test said
I was part Hawaiian.

33:04.210 --> 33:05.910
Well, why was he famous?

33:05.910 --> 33:10.010
- He was a surfer.

33:10.010 --> 33:11.950
So, I guess surfing's
in your blood.

33:11.950 --> 33:14.050
- Yeah, I guess it is.

33:16.520 --> 33:17.590
Thank you so much.

33:30.170 --> 33:31.930
- You're welcome, Lauren.

33:35.900 --> 33:36.970
- I wish I could have met him.

33:39.070 --> 33:41.940
- I do too.

33:41.940 --> 33:44.110
- Can I keep this?

33:44.110 --> 33:46.110
- Of course.

33:46.110 --> 33:48.450
I think he would have
wanted you to have it.

33:50.150 --> 33:52.490
You know what else I think
he would have wanted?

33:54.960 --> 33:56.630
Is for you to get off this bus

33:56.630 --> 34:01.560
and go see your mom and dad
who are worried sick about you.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.070
What do you say?

34:14.110 --> 34:15.240
- Is everything okay?

34:15.240 --> 34:17.950
- Yeah, everything's fine.

34:20.280 --> 34:22.180
- Oh, thank God you're okay.

34:23.450 --> 34:25.550
- We were so worried.
What were you thinking?

34:27.420 --> 34:28.120
- I'm sorry.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.930
- We understand you wanna know

34:29.930 --> 34:31.190
where you come from,
sweetheart.

34:31.190 --> 34:33.060
But you have to promise
to talk to us.

34:33.060 --> 34:35.100
You can't ever
do this again.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.400
- I know, and I won't.

34:38.470 --> 34:41.340
'Cause I know where
I come from now.

34:41.340 --> 34:46.070
This is my great-grandfather.
His name is Kai.

34:46.070 --> 34:48.940
He was a famous surfer
in Hawaii.

34:48.940 --> 34:50.080
Joy found him.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.050
- Well, I'm so happy for you,
honey.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.890
- You are?
- Of course we are.

34:59.220 --> 35:03.060
- I love you.

35:12.930 --> 35:15.100
Thank you for finding this.

35:15.100 --> 35:16.870
- You don't just have me
to thank.

35:16.870 --> 35:18.910
Um, they all helped.

35:24.450 --> 35:26.110
- Hey, Dad.

35:26.110 --> 35:28.180
You think we could learn
how to surf?

35:28.180 --> 35:29.580
- I'd love that, honey,

35:29.580 --> 35:31.450
but I don't know where
we could in New York.

35:31.450 --> 35:33.390
- Actually, I do.

35:33.390 --> 35:35.390
There's a surfing community
in Rockaway Beach.

35:35.390 --> 35:36.860
- Mm-hmm,
you should check it out.

35:36.860 --> 35:38.330
- Uh, we will.

35:38.330 --> 35:41.100
- Thank you.

35:43.900 --> 35:47.070
- Come on, let's go home.

35:48.470 --> 35:50.410
- Bye, Joy.

36:01.220 --> 36:02.950
- You gonna be okay?

36:07.890 --> 36:09.960
Yeah.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.860
I am.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.300
Don't you have an art gallery
to get to?

36:19.300 --> 36:23.210
- Yeah, let's go talk
to Audrey Grenelle.

36:29.780 --> 36:32.750
- Oh, uh, excuse me.
Is Audrey Grenelle still here?

36:32.750 --> 36:34.650
- I'm sorry,
you just missed her.

36:34.650 --> 36:35.920
- Is there any way
to get in touch with her?

36:35.920 --> 36:39.850
- No, and she has no plans
to return.

36:42.060 --> 36:43.060
- Miles, I'm sorry.

36:43.060 --> 36:45.790
I know this was
your one chance to get answers.

36:47.530 --> 36:48.800
- Yeah.

36:49.860 --> 36:53.530
- You okay?
- You know what?

36:53.530 --> 36:55.870
I am.

36:55.870 --> 36:58.710
Knowing what we did
for Lauren and her family,

36:58.710 --> 37:01.210
knowing she's gonna be okay,

37:01.210 --> 37:05.550
that you're gonna be okay...

37:05.550 --> 37:07.110
that's all I care about.

37:07.110 --> 37:09.620
- Me too.

37:09.620 --> 37:12.590
- Yeah, you know what?
Me too.

37:14.820 --> 37:17.160
- You guys are the best.

37:17.160 --> 37:20.190
- ♪ Baby, I just had to know,
so afraid ♪

37:20.190 --> 37:22.630

Who are we?

37:24.930 --> 37:27.200
Where do we fit in this world?

37:27.200 --> 37:30.000
Sometimes, having even
the smallest connection

37:30.000 --> 37:32.710
to our past can chart
a new future.

37:32.710 --> 37:34.580
- And pop up.

37:34.580 --> 37:37.010
Awesome, Lauren.
You're a natural.

37:37.010 --> 37:39.050
- Yes, crushed it.

37:42.720 --> 37:44.650
If it wasn't for you,

37:44.650 --> 37:45.990
Lauren never would have
even known

37:45.990 --> 37:47.720
her great-grandfather was
a surfer.

37:48.660 --> 37:50.730
- Happy to help.

37:50.730 --> 37:52.160
How is everything?

37:52.160 --> 37:53.900
- Great.

37:53.900 --> 37:56.230
I mean, having a connection
to her roots

37:56.230 --> 37:57.670
and where she comes from,

37:57.670 --> 38:01.600
it's...it's brought us closer.

38:01.600 --> 38:03.870
- I'm glad.

38:04.710 --> 38:07.610
- How were you able to find out
about her great-grandfather

38:07.610 --> 38:09.010
so quickly?

38:09.010 --> 38:12.610
And to get a photo of him
as well, I mean...

38:12.610 --> 38:14.020
if I didn't know better,
I'd almost think

38:14.020 --> 38:15.780
you'd had it with you
the whole time.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.720
- You have an amazing family.

38:18.720 --> 38:23.120
You should be so proud
of the daughter you've raised.

38:23.120 --> 38:24.960
I know I would be.

38:26.760 --> 38:29.630
- ♪ That you have me ♪

38:29.630 --> 38:31.430

38:35.070 --> 38:38.440

38:42.580 --> 38:44.780
- And sometimes,
we have to risk

38:44.780 --> 38:46.510
going back to the beginning

38:46.510 --> 38:49.450
in order to take
a step forward.

38:49.450 --> 38:52.450
- Cara, hi.
What are you doing here?

38:52.450 --> 38:54.190
- I just came to tell you

38:54.190 --> 38:57.530
that everything with Lauren
and her family worked out.

38:57.530 --> 38:59.560
- I'm so glad.

38:59.560 --> 39:01.860
- And that you were right.

39:01.860 --> 39:04.970
Families are a lot stronger
than I realized.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.470
I'd like to give this a try.

39:09.470 --> 39:11.910
- ♪ You have me ♪

39:14.880 --> 39:18.050

navigating who you were

39:18.050 --> 39:19.810
and who you want to be.

39:19.810 --> 39:21.720
- You don't look like you have
good news for me, Arthur.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.020
- I don't, and I'm sorry

39:24.020 --> 39:25.950
I spoke with Trish,
and we both agree

39:25.950 --> 39:28.060
it would just take up
too much of my time.

39:29.490 --> 39:30.730
- Let me prove you wrong.

39:30.730 --> 39:31.890
- I'm sorry?

39:31.890 --> 39:35.060
- What do you say
to a trial run?

39:35.060 --> 39:37.730
Nothing official,
sort of off the books,

39:37.730 --> 39:38.770
so to speak.

39:38.770 --> 39:40.840
I know we can make this work

39:40.840 --> 39:43.770
for you and for Trish.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.740
- But in the end,
it's the people closest to you

39:47.740 --> 39:49.180
that help you find your path.

39:49.180 --> 39:52.050
- Seriously, though,
that was a pretty intense

39:52.050 --> 39:54.120
Friend Suggestion,
not that I ever doubted you

39:54.120 --> 39:55.480
for a minute.

39:55.480 --> 39:56.650
- Hey, you know,
look at it this way.

39:56.650 --> 39:58.050
Whoever the next
Friend Suggestion is,

39:58.050 --> 39:59.790
it'll be a cakewalk.

39:59.790 --> 40:01.790
- Actually, I wanted to talk
to you guys about that.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.020
I'm not sure I'm gonna be

40:03.020 --> 40:04.730
helping Friend Suggestions
anymore.

40:04.730 --> 40:06.090
- Wait,
what are you talking about?

40:06.090 --> 40:08.100
- I've decided to go back
to Chicago.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.070
- You're going
for your hearing?

40:11.070 --> 40:13.100
- Yeah, I am.

40:14.100 --> 40:18.070
And I'm gonna win
and get my life back.

40:19.210 --> 40:22.110
I'm ready now that I've made
peace with everything.

40:22.110 --> 40:24.810
My bags are already packed.
I'm not one for good-byes.

40:24.810 --> 40:28.680
So, I thought this was
all I could handle.

40:29.680 --> 40:30.950
Take good care of them for me.

40:30.950 --> 40:33.090
- Absolutely.
- We'll do our best.

40:35.590 --> 40:36.990
- Thanks.

40:40.160 --> 40:41.160
Rakesh.

40:41.160 --> 40:42.230
- Mm-hmm.

40:43.830 --> 40:46.030
You are one of the most
loyal and kind-spirited souls

40:46.030 --> 40:47.840
I've ever met.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.240
Don't ever change.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.510
- I don't think
you have to worry about that.

40:56.010 --> 40:57.880
- Okay, bye.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.910
- All right, I'll walk you out.

40:59.910 --> 41:02.250
- Great.

41:02.250 --> 41:03.850
- Hey, you know,

41:03.850 --> 41:05.790
God Account can be
pretty stubborn.

41:05.790 --> 41:07.520
It may not let you off the hook
so easy.

41:07.520 --> 41:08.890
- Maybe not.

41:08.890 --> 41:11.690
But I have a feeling
that going back to Chicago

41:11.690 --> 41:14.060
and rejoining the PD's office

41:14.060 --> 41:16.200
is what it had in mind
this whole time.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.500
- Well, thank you, Joy.

41:19.500 --> 41:20.800
- Why are you thanking me?

41:20.800 --> 41:22.640
- Well, I thought losing
the Friend Suggestions

41:22.640 --> 41:23.640
was the end.

41:23.640 --> 41:24.940
But helping you led me

41:24.940 --> 41:26.870
to getting a new message
from the God Account,

41:26.870 --> 41:28.940
finding the Lady,
going to Paris,

41:28.940 --> 41:31.580
"The Path,"
my podcast taking off

41:31.580 --> 41:35.480
in the second season,
all of it.

41:35.480 --> 41:37.080
I was your first
Friend Suggestion,

41:37.080 --> 41:40.790
and you helped me way more
than I helped you.

41:40.790 --> 41:44.260
- That's true.

41:46.660 --> 41:50.060
But it's good to know
that my Obi-Wan

41:50.060 --> 41:52.730
will always be here.

41:52.730 --> 41:56.070
Thank you, Miles...

41:56.070 --> 41:58.170
for everything.

42:16.160 --> 42:18.190
- Hmm.

42:24.030 --> 42:25.570
- What do you guys think is
gonna happen

42:25.570 --> 42:26.970
with the God Account?

42:26.970 --> 42:29.570
Think it's gonna pick
someone new,

42:29.570 --> 42:31.670
someone worthy,

42:31.670 --> 42:33.540
someone who's
always been on board

42:33.540 --> 42:34.640
with helping people?

42:34.640 --> 42:36.680
- Oh, you mean me?
- No!

42:37.950 --> 42:40.980
- No, I meant me.
- Yeah, nice try, Rakesh.

42:42.550 --> 42:44.190
You do make a good point,
though.

42:44.190 --> 42:46.990
I mean, now that Joy's gone,

42:46.990 --> 42:49.190
maybe that's the last we hear
from the God Account

42:49.190 --> 42:51.060
when it comes
to Friend Suggestions.

42:55.500 --> 42:57.100
- Maybe not.

43:25.890 --> 43:26.890
- Greg, move your head.
