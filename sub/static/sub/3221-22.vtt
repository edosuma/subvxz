WEBVTT

00:04.741 --> 00:06.441
Sam!

00:09.112 --> 00:11.362
You gotta promise
not to try to bring me back.

00:15.385 --> 00:16.875
Sammy?

00:21.624 --> 00:24.464
You're a hunter. Your brother's
out there. I need you to go.

00:25.028 --> 00:26.198
It's Sam. He's different.

00:28.731 --> 00:30.101
It's his soul. It's gone.

00:30.466 --> 00:33.976
I'm going to go to hell
to fetch your brother's soul.

00:36.773 --> 00:37.973
I don't remember anything.

00:47.617 --> 00:49.637
Finding purgatory's important to me.

00:50.286 --> 00:53.596
An untapped oil well
of every fanged, clawed soul.

00:54.224 --> 00:56.154
Do you have any idea
what souls are worth?

00:56.593 --> 00:57.583
What power they hold?

00:57.894 --> 01:00.554
Raphael and his followers,
they want him to rule heaven.

01:01.097 --> 01:03.727
The last thing we want
is to let him take over.

01:05.235 --> 01:06.905
That limey mook roasted months ago.

01:07.303 --> 01:09.053
Crowley's alive.

01:09.872 --> 01:10.772
I want to discuss...

01:11.074 --> 01:12.884
- a simple business transaction.
- With me?

01:13.309 --> 01:15.889
You and Crowley have been going
after purgatory together?

01:16.412 --> 01:18.142
I can stop Raphael.

01:18.681 --> 01:19.941
You have to trust me.

02:14.337 --> 02:15.857
Hey, we're closed.

02:16.239 --> 02:18.819
Just give me a second.

02:19.342 --> 02:20.802
Sorry, pal. We open at noon.

02:21.444 --> 02:24.544
Look, you don't understand. I...

02:27.050 --> 02:29.920
Okay, I think I understand just fine.

02:30.486 --> 02:33.006
I don't need this kind of hassle,
so just get the hell out.

02:33.523 --> 02:35.393
Just give me a minute to think,
that's all.

02:35.825 --> 02:38.895
Then I'm out of your hair.
One minute, please.

02:49.605 --> 02:50.625
What's your name?

02:51.874 --> 02:53.334
I don't know.

02:53.843 --> 02:56.363
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I mean, I don't remember.

02:57.680 --> 02:58.940
I don't remember anything.

03:13.429 --> 03:15.739
You're dicking with me.

03:16.232 --> 03:18.542
- Nothing?
- I'm telling you, blank slate.

03:19.035 --> 03:21.435
Well, you got a wallet, ID?

03:21.938 --> 03:22.898
I wish I did.

03:23.639 --> 03:25.919
Okay,
what's the last thing you remember?

03:27.009 --> 03:29.589
Um, I woke up on a park bench...

03:30.113 --> 03:33.273
cops shoving a flashlight in my face,
trying to take me in.

03:33.883 --> 03:35.223
- So you ran.
- No, I, um...

03:36.586 --> 03:38.896
I knocked them out cold,
both of them.

03:40.423 --> 03:43.233
No, look, I didn't mean to.
It just happened really fast, you know?

03:43.793 --> 03:45.983
- Instinct or something, I guess.
- Some instinct.

03:46.462 --> 03:49.182
Yeah, tell me about it. Who knows
how to do something like that?

03:49.732 --> 03:52.012
We'll get you to the ER,
the quacks will hash it out.

03:53.302 --> 03:54.912
- No.
- Try "yeah."

03:55.304 --> 03:57.204
The bats have flown the belfry.
See a doctor.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.780
No, I...

04:03.279 --> 04:05.029
I don't have time.

04:05.481 --> 04:07.671
Time for what?

04:09.685 --> 04:13.115
Look, it's hard to explain.
I just feel like I have to be somewhere.

04:13.756 --> 04:15.246
There's something I gotta stop.

04:15.625 --> 04:18.404
Oh, like a wedding? A train?

04:18.961 --> 04:22.391
No, something important,
something like life or death, like...

04:23.065 --> 04:26.225
Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Just relax.
You know, you can't poop it out.

04:26.836 --> 04:29.236
So just... It'll come to you.

04:48.357 --> 04:49.817
What is it?

04:52.528 --> 04:55.928
- You a horror fan?
- Yeah, um, I think so.

04:57.333 --> 04:59.853
You know, I really think so.
Something about this...

05:00.603 --> 05:02.853
- Phillips ain't his last name.
- It's Lovecraft.

05:07.810 --> 05:10.910
Hey, hey, hey.
Seriously, we are taking you to a doctor.

05:11.848 --> 05:13.078
Have you got a computer?

05:14.183 --> 05:15.413
What?

05:17.019 --> 05:18.329
That's it.

05:18.688 --> 05:20.268
It exists. Look. Two towns over.

05:20.857 --> 05:22.377
- You're staying in this dump?
- Maybe.

05:22.758 --> 05:24.368
Maybe you're a hooker.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.490
- Heh. I guess I'll find out.
- Heh.

05:28.331 --> 05:31.321
Look, um, I don't know how to say, uh...

05:31.901 --> 05:34.481
- Thanks for everything.
- Where do you think you're going?

05:35.137 --> 05:36.097
I'll be fine.

05:36.405 --> 05:38.185
Says the head case
that just slumped over.

05:38.641 --> 05:40.951
Is there any way I can convince you
to go to a hospital?

05:41.711 --> 05:43.671
No. Apparently, I'm stubborn.

05:44.547 --> 05:46.737
Well, so am I.

05:48.651 --> 05:49.611
I'm driving.

05:50.052 --> 05:52.132
Look, that's really nice of you
but not necessary.

05:52.588 --> 05:54.198
Really? Look, your eggs
are scrambled.

05:54.590 --> 05:56.020
- But...
- But nothing.

05:56.392 --> 05:58.502
No, I mean, I'm just some guy.

05:58.961 --> 06:01.571
I could be anybody.
You gotta be nuts.

06:02.465 --> 06:03.455
I've been called that.

06:04.100 --> 06:07.350
Look, if I let you go off alone,
I won't be able to sleep at night.

06:07.970 --> 06:11.690
And, honestly, I'm dying to know
how it all turns out.

06:17.813 --> 06:19.803
So where do we start?

06:20.783 --> 06:24.293
Uh, ground floor, corner room.
Nearest to the fire escape.

06:24.954 --> 06:26.704
That's the one I'd pick.
Quickest getaway.

06:27.123 --> 06:29.293
And why do you know that?

06:30.393 --> 06:31.973
I just do.

06:47.944 --> 06:49.344
Hey, you got a credit card?

06:49.712 --> 06:51.462
Uh...

06:52.148 --> 06:53.988
Why? Are we checking in?

06:54.984 --> 06:56.294
Sort of.

07:04.226 --> 07:06.536
Dude, who are you?

07:07.830 --> 07:09.500
Good question.

07:18.608 --> 07:23.178
- This all yours?
- I don't know. I guess.

07:24.547 --> 07:26.447
Well, I love what you've done
with the place.

07:26.882 --> 07:30.192
<i>It's very Beautiful Mind meets Se7en.</i>

07:30.987 --> 07:32.887
Sorry. I talk when I'm nervous.

07:36.759 --> 07:39.009
Hey, well,
I guess we know your name.

07:39.795 --> 07:41.255
Nice to meet you, Jimmy Page.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.350
And Neil Peart.

07:47.403 --> 07:48.983
And Angus Young.

07:50.873 --> 07:53.683
Okay, listen, no offense,
but I'm really starting to freak out.

07:54.710 --> 07:56.520
You and me both.

08:07.690 --> 08:09.270
Where is she?

08:09.992 --> 08:13.652
She said to meet her here.
I'll try her again.

08:29.178 --> 08:31.108
- Elle?
- Hey.

08:31.547 --> 08:33.657
I guess I could have used your help
after all.

08:34.116 --> 08:35.405
- Just be still.
- What happened?

08:36.719 --> 08:38.119
They took me.

08:38.721 --> 08:40.181
I got away.

08:40.890 --> 08:42.350
Oh, Ellie.

08:43.125 --> 08:45.025
What have they done to you?

08:45.461 --> 08:46.391
Everything.

08:47.129 --> 08:49.299
The demon I could have handled,
you know?

08:49.765 --> 08:51.225
But when the angel stepped in...

08:55.471 --> 08:56.581
I told him, Bobby.

08:57.707 --> 09:00.227
They have enough
to crack purgatory wide open.

09:00.743 --> 09:01.973
Tell me. I need to know.

09:02.344 --> 09:04.564
They need virgin blood.

09:05.047 --> 09:07.007
That's a milk run for them.

09:07.450 --> 09:10.410
And they need the blood
of a purgatory native. Heh.

09:10.986 --> 09:13.006
Well, they've got plenty of that now.

09:13.856 --> 09:15.606
Have they opened it yet?

09:16.459 --> 09:19.939
Tomorrow. The moon and the eclipse.

09:20.796 --> 09:22.526
- I'm sorry, Bobby.
- No, it's okay.

09:22.932 --> 09:26.032
- I'm sorry, really. Sorry.
- Tell us where they are.

09:29.105 --> 09:30.335
Elle?

09:40.416 --> 09:42.256
I'm sorry this had to happen.

09:45.955 --> 09:47.005
Crowley got carried away.

09:47.323 --> 09:50.253
Yeah, I bet it was all Crowley,
you son of a bitch.

09:51.193 --> 09:53.183
You don't even see it, do you?

09:53.629 --> 09:56.969
- How totally off the rails you are.
- Enough. I don't care what you think.

09:57.833 --> 09:59.883
I tried to make you understand.
You won't listen.

10:00.336 --> 10:01.626
So let me make this simple.

10:01.971 --> 10:05.451
Please go home
and let me stop Raphael.

10:06.308 --> 10:07.598
I won't ask again.

10:08.444 --> 10:11.104
Well, good, because I think
you already know the answer.

10:14.550 --> 10:15.980
I wish it hadn't come to this.

10:18.420 --> 10:21.520
Well, rest assured,
when this is all over...

10:22.525 --> 10:25.925
I will save Sam,
but only if you stand down.

10:26.562 --> 10:27.672
Save Sam from what?

10:31.734 --> 10:34.544
Hey, hey. Are you okay?

10:36.672 --> 10:37.752
Sam.

10:38.073 --> 10:39.713
My name is Sam.

10:43.312 --> 10:45.562
So, what do you remember?

10:46.048 --> 10:49.478
Well, ha, it might sound pretty strange
if I said it aloud.

10:50.352 --> 10:52.432
Oh, it couldn't get any stranger.

10:55.191 --> 10:57.411
Yeah? Don't be so sure.

11:01.497 --> 11:04.047
Look, I don't know.
I mean, it's all pretty spotty, you know?

11:04.567 --> 11:07.877
I just remember I was with two guys.

11:08.871 --> 11:11.481
One was like a male-model type...

11:12.007 --> 11:13.907
and the other
was an older guy named, uh...

11:16.011 --> 11:17.471
Bobby.

11:18.681 --> 11:21.841
Okay. Well, what are you looking for?

11:23.285 --> 11:26.415
- Here. Bobby Singer. That has to be it.
- Is there a phone number?

11:27.022 --> 11:29.212
No, just an address.
Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

11:29.692 --> 11:31.392
South Dakota.

11:32.261 --> 11:33.461
Okay. Uh...

11:33.796 --> 11:35.346
Listen, Sam...

11:35.731 --> 11:37.311
- Sam, right?
- Yeah.

11:37.700 --> 11:40.480
Look, I'm really sorry,
but this is where I gotta get off.

11:41.036 --> 11:42.846
Oh, no. Of course. No problem.

11:43.272 --> 11:45.852
Okay.
Well, how are you gonna get there?

11:52.882 --> 11:54.312
I guess I'll take my car.

12:02.324 --> 12:03.844
That's mine.

12:04.460 --> 12:06.190
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.

12:06.595 --> 12:10.575
Look, Sam, I don't feel right
about you going off like this.

12:11.467 --> 12:12.487
Oh, look, don't worry.

12:12.801 --> 12:15.171
You've done way too much
for me already.

12:15.671 --> 12:18.071
That's not what I mean.
What I mean is...

12:18.574 --> 12:20.214
I've got a bad feeling, you know...

12:20.609 --> 12:23.449
with those IDs
and that shady-ass hotel room.

12:24.046 --> 12:25.856
Whatever you're looking for...

12:26.282 --> 12:28.392
you might not like what you find.

12:30.052 --> 12:32.012
What other choice do I have?

12:33.689 --> 12:35.089
You could stick around here
a little bit longer...

12:35.457 --> 12:38.237
get your head straight,
instead of going off, flying blind...

12:41.096 --> 12:42.876
What the hell was that?

12:43.299 --> 12:44.199
Stay down.

12:55.177 --> 12:56.347
Sam.

12:56.679 --> 12:57.969
Sammy.

12:59.515 --> 13:01.975
Sammy? Sammy?

13:03.085 --> 13:05.195
Come on. Snap out of it.

13:25.394 --> 13:29.174
<i>Well, you've got your diamonds
And you've got your</i>

13:29.865 --> 13:31.205
Anything?

13:31.600 --> 13:33.620
I can't just sit here, Bobby.
I got to help him.

13:34.103 --> 13:36.323
- Dean.
- Dreamscape his noggin. Something.

13:36.806 --> 13:38.206
You know what Cass did.

13:38.607 --> 13:42.147
The dam inside your brother's head
is gone, and all hell's spilling loose.

13:42.812 --> 13:44.272
We don't know what's going on.

13:44.647 --> 13:47.137
- We have got to do something.
- And we will.

13:47.650 --> 13:50.460
But right now, we got 16 hours
till they pop purgatory.

13:51.020 --> 13:54.060
I'm down one man.
I can't afford to be down two.

13:54.657 --> 13:57.647
How's that going? We've got no line
on Crowley. We got no line on Cass.

13:58.227 --> 13:59.247
Balthazar's MIA.

13:59.562 --> 14:02.142
All we've got is Sam
going through whatever the hell this is!

14:03.199 --> 14:04.569
You know...

14:06.635 --> 14:08.415
this is exactly what Cass wants...

14:09.705 --> 14:11.875
for you to fall to pieces.

14:14.510 --> 14:16.440
Just try to think
of what Sam would want.

14:21.283 --> 14:23.363
Find Cass, Bobby.

14:24.020 --> 14:25.100
Find him now.

14:25.421 --> 14:28.081
<i>Your old man took her diamonds</i>

14:28.624 --> 14:32.194
<i>And tiaras by the score</i>

14:32.962 --> 14:35.422
<i>Now she gets her kicks</i>

14:35.931 --> 14:36.801
<i>In Stepney</i>

14:38.267 --> 14:40.487
- Do you smell whiskey?
- Okay, Sam, would you focus?

14:41.437 --> 14:45.187
- Yeah. I'm sorry.
- Okay, so who shot at us?

14:46.075 --> 14:48.005
I didn't really get a good look.

14:48.444 --> 14:50.464
Okay, we gotta go to the cops.

14:50.913 --> 14:52.933
No. If we can get to my friends,
they can help.

14:53.382 --> 14:54.992
You don't know
if they're your friends.

14:55.384 --> 14:57.874
You don't know anything
about anything.

14:58.387 --> 14:59.647
- Turn around.
- No.

14:59.989 --> 15:03.029
- Look, you're safer with me.
- How do you know that?

15:03.826 --> 15:05.786
You're scaring me.

15:07.630 --> 15:13.400
<i>So don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire</i>

15:16.272 --> 15:21.022
<i>So don't play with me
'Cause you're playing with fire</i>

15:25.881 --> 15:28.131
What? No way.

15:32.254 --> 15:33.594
What was that?

15:34.323 --> 15:36.053
What do you mean? It's daylight.

15:37.460 --> 15:40.530
- Yeah?
- It was night, and now it's day.

15:41.931 --> 15:45.501
- It was always day.
- No, no, no. No, it wasn't. It...

15:46.502 --> 15:48.112
What the hell is going on here?

15:49.705 --> 15:51.315
Okay, so I am all filled up
on crazy for today.

15:51.740 --> 15:53.170
You know what, Sam? I'll see you.

15:53.542 --> 15:55.732
Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey.

16:00.316 --> 16:01.456
Get in the car.

16:21.137 --> 16:22.657
Wow.

17:17.626 --> 17:18.766
My God.

17:20.128 --> 17:22.118
Am I really that gawky?

17:24.066 --> 17:25.435
Howdy.

17:26.769 --> 17:30.109
- This is impossible.
- Cold. Try again.

17:30.739 --> 17:34.219
- I'm hallucinating.
- Warmer.

17:34.877 --> 17:39.157
But see, normally, you're awake
when you're tripping balls.

17:40.783 --> 17:41.953
I'm dreaming?

17:42.284 --> 17:44.914
And someone just won a copy
of the home game.

17:45.721 --> 17:47.711
We're inside your grapefruit, Sam.

17:48.157 --> 17:50.467
Son, you've been juiced.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.910
I don't remember anything.

17:53.295 --> 17:55.875
Well, your BFF Cass
brought the hell wall tumbling down...

17:56.398 --> 18:01.258
and you, pathetic infant that you are,
shattered into pieces.

18:02.471 --> 18:04.491
Piece. Piece.

18:05.608 --> 18:07.338
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

18:07.743 --> 18:08.823
Why would you?

18:09.144 --> 18:11.334
You're Jell-O, pal, unlike me.

18:13.482 --> 18:15.232
- What are you?
- I'm not handicapped.

18:16.018 --> 18:18.008
I'm not saddled with a soul.

18:19.121 --> 18:22.401
In fact, I used to skipper this meatboat
for a while.

18:23.025 --> 18:24.575
It was smooth sailing.

18:24.960 --> 18:27.210
I was sharp, strong.

18:28.130 --> 18:30.500
That is,
till they crammed your soul back in.

18:31.767 --> 18:32.757
Now look at you.

18:33.535 --> 18:35.935
Same misty-eyed milksop
you always were.

18:36.939 --> 18:39.279
That's because souls are weak.

18:40.442 --> 18:41.402
They're a liability.

18:43.612 --> 18:47.712
Now, nothing personal,
but run the numbers.

18:48.450 --> 18:51.580
Someone's gotta take charge
around here before it's too late.

19:11.974 --> 19:13.964
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

20:20.275 --> 20:22.235
You think I'm bad?

20:23.779 --> 20:25.949
Wait till you meet the other one.

20:39.661 --> 20:41.241
Sammy! Sam!

21:00.582 --> 21:02.512
I remember who I am.

21:03.419 --> 21:05.609
Everything I did this past year.

21:07.589 --> 21:09.319
And I remember you.

21:14.463 --> 21:16.773
Walk away, or the girl dies.

21:24.506 --> 21:26.206
There goes your leverage.

21:33.382 --> 21:36.452
Didn't I tell you to turn back,
that you wouldn't like what you found?

21:37.286 --> 21:38.896
I'm sorry.

21:40.022 --> 21:41.332
I'm so sorry.

21:41.890 --> 21:44.000
Not as sorry as you're gonna be.

21:58.173 --> 22:00.573
Look what the cat dragged in.

22:02.544 --> 22:06.584
Well, at least you mudfish
finally got the angel-proofing right.

22:07.316 --> 22:10.566
How's Sleeping Beauty?
You didn't steal any kisses, I trust?

22:11.420 --> 22:13.590
What the hell took you so long?

22:14.423 --> 22:17.233
Honestly?
I was having second thoughts.

22:18.527 --> 22:20.137
- About?
- About whether to help you.

22:20.529 --> 22:25.069
I was thinking maybe I should
rip out your sticky bits instead.

22:25.868 --> 22:27.328
And what did you decide?

22:30.038 --> 22:31.468
Well...

22:35.344 --> 22:37.454
Cass and Crowley are there.

22:38.180 --> 22:39.640
That's where the show gets started.

22:43.085 --> 22:44.985
Give us a minute to pack,
then zap us there.

22:45.420 --> 22:46.730
No, no, no. I don't think so.

22:47.089 --> 22:49.669
- Balthazar.
- I'm betraying a friend here.

22:50.526 --> 22:52.306
A very powerful friend. We all are.

22:53.161 --> 22:56.501
So I think I've stuck my neck out
far enough already.

22:59.301 --> 23:00.731
Good luck.

23:14.383 --> 23:16.223
Your purgatory power shake, monsieur.

23:17.085 --> 23:20.045
Half monster, half virgin.

23:24.293 --> 23:25.843
Thank you.

23:28.597 --> 23:31.147
You seem even more constipated
than usual.

23:31.700 --> 23:33.250
Maybe get you some colon blow?

23:34.236 --> 23:35.786
I'm renegotiating our terms.

23:36.605 --> 23:37.895
Is that so?

23:38.240 --> 23:39.470
What terms do you propose?

23:40.442 --> 23:41.492
You get nothing.

23:43.211 --> 23:44.791
Not one single soul.

23:46.315 --> 23:49.245
Can't help notice,
seems a bit unfairly weighted.

23:52.854 --> 23:56.044
Castiel, you wouldn't dare.

23:57.092 --> 23:59.582
I brought you this deal.

24:00.295 --> 24:03.135
You think
I'm handing all that power...

24:03.932 --> 24:05.772
to the king of hell?

24:06.234 --> 24:08.344
I'm neither stupid nor wicked.

24:08.804 --> 24:12.054
Unbelievable. Have you forgotten that
you're the bottom in this relationship?

24:12.674 --> 24:13.984
Here are your options.

24:14.343 --> 24:16.513
You either flee, or you die.

24:18.246 --> 24:19.826
We made a pact.

24:20.248 --> 24:22.028
Even I don't break contracts like this.

24:22.451 --> 24:23.851
Flee...

24:24.786 --> 24:25.716
or die.

24:27.556 --> 24:31.066
Boy,
you can't trust anyone these days.

25:12.534 --> 25:13.964
Hey.

25:17.706 --> 25:19.226
Hey!

25:21.810 --> 25:23.560
Oh.

25:24.379 --> 25:26.019
Hi, Sam.

25:30.318 --> 25:31.688
So?

25:32.821 --> 25:34.491
Which one are you?

25:36.458 --> 25:37.718
Don't you know?

25:46.435 --> 25:47.865
I'm the one that remembers hell.

26:06.947 --> 26:08.697
Time's up, Dean.

26:09.650 --> 26:11.320
Just a second.

26:18.792 --> 26:21.312
All right,
this is where we're gonna be, Sam.

26:23.764 --> 26:26.634
You get your lazy ass out of bed
and come meet us.

26:29.136 --> 26:30.946
Sammy, please.

26:44.651 --> 26:46.291
I wish you hadn't come, Sam.

26:46.687 --> 26:48.967
I had to. I'm here, right?

26:49.890 --> 26:52.520
Out there in the real world,
I'm at Bobby's, aren't I?

26:53.927 --> 26:54.887
How do you know?

26:55.195 --> 26:58.185
This whole time, I smell nothing
but Old Spice and whiskey.

26:59.566 --> 27:03.906
I figured if I could get back here,
back to my body, I could...

27:05.806 --> 27:07.826
I don't know.
I could snap out of it somehow.

27:08.308 --> 27:09.888
First, you have to go through me.

27:11.211 --> 27:12.961
- Why?
- Humpty Dumpty has to put himself...

27:13.380 --> 27:16.890
back together again
before he can wake up.

27:18.018 --> 27:19.388
And I'm the last piece.

27:21.889 --> 27:23.499
Which means...

27:25.425 --> 27:27.535
I have to know what you know.

27:28.896 --> 27:30.126
What happened in the cage.

27:30.464 --> 27:32.134
Trust me.

27:33.200 --> 27:34.370
You don't wanna know it.

27:38.405 --> 27:39.985
You're right.

27:41.608 --> 27:43.038
- But I still have to.
- Sam...

27:43.911 --> 27:45.081
you can't imagine.

27:46.146 --> 27:48.196
Stay here, go back...

27:48.649 --> 27:51.719
find that bartender, go find Jess,
but don't do this.

27:53.053 --> 27:54.863
I know you.

27:55.289 --> 27:56.459
You're not strong enough.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.930
We'll just have to see.

28:03.397 --> 28:04.917
Why is this so important to you?

28:07.467 --> 28:09.017
You know me.

28:09.403 --> 28:10.303
You know why.

28:11.104 --> 28:13.764
I'm not leaving my brother
alone out there.

28:24.117 --> 28:25.347
I'm not gonna fight you.

28:27.321 --> 28:29.491
But this is your last chance.

28:42.336 --> 28:43.826
Good luck.

28:45.505 --> 28:47.285
You're gonna need it.

29:23.844 --> 29:25.714
You rang, Cass?

29:26.346 --> 29:29.386
Yeah. We have a problem.
Dean Winchester is on his way here.

29:29.983 --> 29:32.383
Really? Oh, how did he even know
where we were?

29:32.886 --> 29:36.256
Apparently, we have a Judas
in our midst.

29:37.691 --> 29:38.891
Ah. Heh, heh.

29:39.226 --> 29:40.426
Holy hell.

29:42.095 --> 29:43.055
Who is it?

29:43.363 --> 29:46.733
I bet it's that bloody little cherub,
isn't it?

29:50.971 --> 29:53.781
I don't know.
But I need you to find out.

29:54.341 --> 29:56.211
Of course. Um, right away, right away.

29:56.777 --> 29:58.507
But what do you want me to do
about Dean?

29:58.912 --> 30:00.202
Nothing.

30:00.881 --> 30:02.991
I'll handle him myself.

30:05.419 --> 30:06.619
Castiel?

30:08.221 --> 30:09.891
Are you all right?

30:10.691 --> 30:12.501
First Sam and Dean, and now this.

30:13.193 --> 30:14.863
I'm doing my best...

30:15.595 --> 30:18.255
in impossible circumstances.

30:18.865 --> 30:20.735
My friends, they...

30:21.702 --> 30:23.482
abandon me...

30:24.538 --> 30:26.438
plot against me.

30:28.742 --> 30:30.232
It's difficult to understand.

30:31.211 --> 30:34.721
Well, you've always got little old me.

30:40.387 --> 30:41.437
Yes.

30:42.155 --> 30:43.145
I'll always have you.

30:43.457 --> 30:45.097
Cass.

31:22.963 --> 31:25.743
I count a dozen mooks,
probably more.

31:27.334 --> 31:28.854
Demons?

31:30.070 --> 31:31.710
Angels.

31:33.106 --> 31:35.036
How are we gonna take out
that many angels?

31:35.475 --> 31:38.725
We don't. We'll ninja our way in.

31:39.346 --> 31:41.836
Awesome, yeah.
Till they hear your knee squeak.

31:42.349 --> 31:44.489
- Shut up.
- Oh, what, now you got thin skin?

31:44.951 --> 31:45.821
No, shut up.

31:47.287 --> 31:48.397
You hear that?

31:56.797 --> 31:58.847
What the hell is that?

32:02.636 --> 32:04.366
<i>Oh, T. rex, maybe?</i>

32:08.542 --> 32:10.472
Holy mother of...

32:13.914 --> 32:16.024
Get to the car. Get to the car.

32:41.842 --> 32:44.472
Never underestimate the king of hell,
darling.

32:45.879 --> 32:48.219
I know a lot of swell tricks.

32:49.549 --> 32:53.239
Now, I think it's time
to re-renegotiate our terms.

32:58.091 --> 33:00.281
Sweaty hands, mate.

33:01.161 --> 33:02.391
I don't understand.

33:02.729 --> 33:04.039
You can palm me all you want.

33:04.397 --> 33:07.007
I'm safe and sound
under the wing of my new partner.

33:10.203 --> 33:11.953
Hello, Castiel.

33:12.973 --> 33:14.643
Raphael.

33:25.481 --> 33:26.881
Consorting with demons.

33:27.483 --> 33:28.853
I thought that was beneath you.

33:29.218 --> 33:31.848
Heard you were doing it.
Sounded like fun.

33:32.388 --> 33:36.108
You know, Castiel, you've said all sorts
of shameful, appalling...

33:36.792 --> 33:38.782
scatological things about Raphael.

33:39.228 --> 33:40.428
I found him...

33:41.764 --> 33:44.834
Her to be really quite reasonable.

33:45.434 --> 33:46.454
You fool.

33:47.103 --> 33:49.713
Raphael will deceive and destroy you
at the speed of thought.

33:50.239 --> 33:52.229
Right,
because you're such a straight shooter.

33:52.675 --> 33:56.685
She... He has offered me protection
against all comers.

33:57.413 --> 33:59.053
In exchange for what?

33:59.682 --> 34:00.972
The purgatory blood.

34:01.918 --> 34:03.288
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

34:03.653 --> 34:07.193
Castiel, you really think
I would let you open that door?

34:08.591 --> 34:10.670
Take in that much power?

34:11.293 --> 34:15.333
If anyone is going to be the new god,
it's me.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.580
He's gonna bring the apocalypse...

34:20.002 --> 34:21.752
- and worse.
- This is your doing, mate.

34:22.170 --> 34:24.190
I'm merely grabbing the best offer
on the table.

34:24.639 --> 34:28.949
Now, you have two options.

34:29.712 --> 34:32.431
Flee or die.

35:12.989 --> 35:14.449
Bobby.

35:15.558 --> 35:17.108
Bobby.

35:20.596 --> 35:22.326
Come on. We got to go.

36:02.405 --> 36:03.395
Bit busy, gentlemen.

36:05.808 --> 36:07.038
Be with you in a moment.

36:45.715 --> 36:49.845
Mm-hm. Maybe I said it wrong.

36:50.653 --> 36:52.643
You said it perfectly.

36:53.689 --> 36:55.419
But what you needed was this.

37:14.944 --> 37:16.554
I see.

37:22.485 --> 37:24.825
And we've been working with...

37:25.821 --> 37:27.401
dog blood. Naturally.

37:28.391 --> 37:30.121
Enough of these games, Castiel.

37:30.960 --> 37:32.450
Give us the blood.

37:32.828 --> 37:34.138
You...

37:34.897 --> 37:37.387
Game's over. His jar is empty.

37:41.036 --> 37:44.226
So, Castiel, how did your ritual go?

37:45.040 --> 37:46.970
Better than ours, I'll bet.

38:16.068 --> 38:18.528
You can't imagine what it's like.

38:19.038 --> 38:20.238
They're all inside me.

38:21.307 --> 38:23.967
Millions upon millions of souls.

38:24.911 --> 38:25.871
Sounds sexy.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.330
Exit stage Crowley.

38:31.784 --> 38:33.424
Now, what's the matter, Raphael?

38:34.053 --> 38:36.513
- Somebody clip your wings?
- Castiel, please.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.803
You let the demon go,
but not your own brother?

38:40.359 --> 38:42.409
The demon I have plans for.

38:42.995 --> 38:44.695
You, on the other hand...

38:58.511 --> 39:00.351
So you see...

39:01.514 --> 39:03.264
I saved you.

39:05.084 --> 39:06.694
You sure did, Cass.

39:07.086 --> 39:07.986
Thank you.

39:09.589 --> 39:11.489
You doubted me.

39:12.325 --> 39:14.195
Fought against me.

39:17.463 --> 39:18.833
But I was right all along.

39:19.198 --> 39:20.278
Okay, Cass, you were.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.040
We're sorry.

39:23.736 --> 39:26.016
Let's just defuse you, okay?

39:27.473 --> 39:28.403
What do you mean?

39:30.476 --> 39:31.406
You're full of nuke.

39:32.411 --> 39:33.491
It's not safe.

39:33.846 --> 39:35.216
So before the eclipse ends...

39:35.581 --> 39:38.191
let's get them souls back
to where they belong.

39:38.885 --> 39:42.105
- Oh, no. They belong with me.
- No, Cass, it's scrambling your brain.

39:42.722 --> 39:43.772
No, I'm not finished yet.

39:44.657 --> 39:47.787
Raphael had many followers,
and I must...

39:49.629 --> 39:50.939
punish them all severely.

39:54.367 --> 39:55.567
Listen to me.

39:56.802 --> 39:58.382
Listen.

39:59.438 --> 40:02.128
I know there's a lot of bad water
under the bridge.

40:03.910 --> 40:06.020
But we were family once.

40:07.013 --> 40:08.383
I'd have died for you.

40:09.916 --> 40:11.146
I almost did a few times.

40:11.684 --> 40:13.234
So if that means anything to you...

40:16.923 --> 40:18.473
Please.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.722
I've lost Lisa, I've lost Ben...

40:23.296 --> 40:24.586
and now I've lost Sam.

40:27.166 --> 40:28.366
Don't make me lose you too.

40:31.771 --> 40:33.821
You don't need this kind of juice
anymore, Cass.

40:35.308 --> 40:37.478
Get rid of it before it kills us all.

40:40.613 --> 40:42.423
You're just saying that
because I won...

40:43.215 --> 40:44.445
because you're afraid.

40:47.787 --> 40:50.127
You're not my family, Dean.

40:51.057 --> 40:52.897
I have no family.

41:08.674 --> 41:10.754
I'm glad you made it, Sam.

41:13.746 --> 41:16.736
But the angel blade won't work...

41:18.150 --> 41:19.670
because I'm not an angel anymore.

41:23.956 --> 41:25.216
I'm your new god.

41:27.259 --> 41:28.189
A better one.

41:29.962 --> 41:31.952
So you will bow down...

41:33.499 --> 41:36.659
and profess your love unto me,
your lord...

41:39.071 --> 41:41.211
or I shall destroy you.
