03:05.634 --> 03:09.086
Excuse me.

03:17.939 --> 03:20.430
- Nervous?
- No.

03:20.608 --> 03:25.234
- I hate flying.
- Is something I ate.

03:25.405 --> 03:31.490
Maybe you're just excited
about getting home.

03:32.789 --> 03:36.786
- I've got to go to the john again.
- I'll wait.

03:36.959 --> 03:42.202
- No, I'll catch up to you. Okay?
- Okay.

04:45.574 --> 04:48.576
Passport.

05:00.215 --> 05:04.047
Basket.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.913
Is a frisbee.

05:34.127 --> 05:38.290
You throw it and catch it.
Is a game.

05:38.465 --> 05:42.166
A game...

06:31.896 --> 06:37.022
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, great. Want a piece of gum?

06:38.613 --> 06:41.235
Thank you.

06:41.408 --> 06:45.405
See this?
Janis Joplin died yesterday.

06:45.578 --> 06:48.663
Overdose.
There never was anyone like Janis.

06:48.832 --> 06:53.708
- There never was anyone like you.
- Knock it off.

06:53.879 --> 06:57.627
- You never take anything seriously.
- Nothing.

07:19.782 --> 07:23.115
- Whas he saying?
- I don't know.

07:23.285 --> 07:28.623
They always have everything
ass backwards in Turkey.

07:29.875 --> 07:35.665
- Billy, whas the matter?
- Passport. Susan, get on the plane.

07:35.840 --> 07:43.338
- Whas wrong, are you sick?
- Get on the plane. Go.

08:10.127 --> 08:13.543
I'm looking for my passport.

08:17.134 --> 08:21.631
Harry, you'd better
get rid of those grenades.

09:22.246 --> 09:25.200
Get down.

10:33.238 --> 10:36.323
- Name?
- William Hayes.

10:36.492 --> 10:40.325
- William...
- Hayes.

10:40.496 --> 10:44.624
Hayes.

10:44.792 --> 10:48.210
- American?
- Thas right.

10:48.381 --> 10:52.628
Yes, American. United States.

10:52.802 --> 10:55.472
American.

11:08.736 --> 11:13.112
- Name?
- Jesus... William Hayes.

11:13.281 --> 11:19.996
- Name?
- Hayes. H-A-Y-E-S.

13:00.939 --> 13:06.100
Howdy, Billy.
How are you doing? Okay?

13:08.488 --> 13:14.942
I think these gentlemen
have finished for the time being.

13:15.120 --> 13:19.035
If you'd like
to put your clothes on.

13:40.522 --> 13:44.984
The officer wants to know
if you're afraid.

13:45.153 --> 13:48.403
No, I'm not afraid.

14:02.672 --> 14:06.586
The officer said
there's nothing to be afraid of.

14:06.759 --> 14:10.674
Co-operate,
and you'll be on the plane home.

14:20.148 --> 14:25.309
- Where did you get the hashish?
- From a cab driver.

14:25.488 --> 14:28.489
In the playing shop at the bazaar.

14:41.421 --> 14:47.424
- Would you recognise him again?
- I think so.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.723
You decided to fly at a bad time.

14:57.898 --> 15:03.521
Guerrillas all over the place,
blowing up planes...

15:03.696 --> 15:08.488
Four planes in four days.
Don't you read the newspapers?

15:08.659 --> 15:12.822
There's been a shit storm
over the flow of heroin from Turkey.

15:12.997 --> 15:16.864
- I didn't have heroin.
- A drug is a drug.

15:17.043 --> 15:21.670
It was my first time.
It was only two kilos.

15:21.840 --> 15:25.374
It doesn't matter
if it was 2 or 200 kilos.

15:25.552 --> 15:29.846
Catching you shows the world
Turkey is fighting the drug trade.

15:30.015 --> 15:35.602
- Are you with the Consulate?
- Something like that. Cigarette?

15:36.480 --> 15:41.356
- What did you pay this cab driver?
- $200. My last 200.

15:41.527 --> 15:45.940
- How much did you figure to make?
- I'd only sell it to my friends.

15:46.115 --> 15:50.279
- I'm not a pusher. Honest.
- It beats working.

15:50.454 --> 15:55.794
- Have you got a family?
- Mother, father, brother, sister.

15:55.960 --> 16:00.041
- Long Island.
- Ill be tough on them.

16:00.215 --> 16:04.545
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah, she was on the plane.

16:06.971 --> 16:13.889
- She didn't know anything about it.
- Lucky girl.

16:14.063 --> 16:18.773
- She used to say I was lucky.
- Les hope so, Billy.

20:30.129 --> 20:33.047
You seem like a nice enough kid.

20:33.216 --> 20:38.293
But you try it,
and I'll blow your brains out.

21:07.335 --> 21:14.169
Mom and Dad, this is the hardest
letter I've ever had to write.

21:14.343 --> 21:20.845
I hoped to get out of this quickly,
so you'd never know about it.

21:21.017 --> 21:27.386
But that just isn't possible now.
I don't know whas going to happen.

21:27.565 --> 21:31.943
What can I say to you?
Will "I'm sorry" make a difference?

21:32.112 --> 21:37.107
Will it ease the pain,
the shame you must be feeling?

21:37.284 --> 21:40.699
Forgive me, please.

21:55.970 --> 21:59.220
Could I have a blanket?

21:59.390 --> 22:02.890
Is cold.
Could I have a blanket?

22:03.061 --> 22:09.314
- A blanket!
- Too late. Tomorrow.

22:09.485 --> 22:16.734
He'll be here tomorrow, I think.
Goodnight.

22:51.696 --> 22:55.944
- Can you speak English?
- Your cell is open.

22:56.118 --> 23:00.495
Blankets, three cells down.
You get me one.

24:18.665 --> 24:21.203
I needed a blanket.

24:24.213 --> 24:27.214
William Hayes.

24:42.524 --> 24:45.692
I needed a blanket, I was cold!

26:01.150 --> 26:03.558
Jesus...

26:03.736 --> 26:06.986
Come on, you must stand.

26:08.031 --> 26:11.946
You'd better walk around,
or your feet will swell up.

26:12.119 --> 26:19.287
- You've got to be crazy.
- We all are. Smoke some of this.

26:20.171 --> 26:26.755
You've been out for days,
talking all kinds of shit.

26:26.928 --> 26:30.463
- How does it feel?
- About as good as it looks.

26:30.640 --> 26:38.055
Gecmis olsun. Is Turkish.
It means, "May it pass quickly."

26:39.566 --> 26:43.695
- It looks like a cheap hotel.
- The room service is lousy.

26:43.863 --> 26:48.156
I'm Jimmy Booth.
This is Erich... something Swedish.

26:48.325 --> 26:51.410
- Just Erich.
- He cleaned you up.

26:51.579 --> 26:56.158
Thanks. I'm Billy Hayes...
at least I used to be.

27:34.625 --> 27:38.789
- Why peacocks?
- They use them instead of dogs.

27:38.963 --> 27:45.630
They scream like mad if they're
disturbed and they don't get rabies.

27:46.721 --> 27:52.013
- Who are the kids?
- Little fuckers...

27:52.186 --> 27:56.765
Thieves, rapists, murderers...
You name it, they do it.

27:56.941 --> 28:01.021
Don't trust any of them.
They tell Rifki everything.

28:01.195 --> 28:04.481
He's the squeal around here.
He sells tea, -

28:04.657 --> 28:08.441
- hash, blankets,
anything for a buck.

28:09.995 --> 28:13.697
- What are you in for, hash?
- Yeah.

28:15.251 --> 28:18.170
- Where?
- At the airport.

28:18.339 --> 28:24.508
Thas heavy.
This ain't the good old USA.

28:24.679 --> 28:28.463
In Turkey, is a fucking accident
if you're innocent.

28:28.641 --> 28:33.305
- Nobody here is innocent.
- Don't pay too much attention.

28:33.481 --> 28:39.104
Anything is possible in Turkey.
They may not hit you for smuggling.

28:39.278 --> 28:43.323
If they make it possession,
you might even get bail.

28:43.490 --> 28:48.864
If you make bail, you're free.
Sneak across the border to Greece.

28:49.038 --> 28:55.077
Sure, keep dreaming.
See where it gets you. Like Max.

28:55.253 --> 28:59.584
Is going to be a while
before you taste a hamburger again.

28:59.759 --> 29:04.254
- You broke the law.
- The law is sometimes wrong.

29:04.429 --> 29:07.347
The law is never wrong!

29:08.600 --> 29:12.136
The fucking law is.

29:19.821 --> 29:23.820
- People get on his nerves.
- Whas he in for?

29:23.993 --> 29:26.911
Stealing from a mosque.

29:27.080 --> 29:30.365
- What did he steal?
- Two candlesticks.

29:30.541 --> 29:33.827
- Thas all?
- Jimmy has more balls than brains.

29:34.003 --> 29:38.999
He was in for a year and a half
before he even told his parents.

29:39.176 --> 29:44.596
- What about you?
- Hashish, like most foreigners.

29:44.764 --> 29:49.474
- What did they give you?
- 12 years. I had 100 grams.

29:49.645 --> 29:55.897
You've got to get a good lawyer.
Talk to the Englishman. Max.

29:56.068 --> 29:59.936
He's been in the longest.
Seven years.

30:17.383 --> 30:21.677
Gastro. Stomach medicine.

30:23.473 --> 30:28.551
Is got codeine in it.
Is the best I can do around here.

30:28.729 --> 30:31.101
Max...

30:31.273 --> 30:35.485
- Lawyers?
- Oh, yeah.

30:36.653 --> 30:40.734
There's no straight lawyers
in Turkey.

30:40.908 --> 30:44.527
They're all bent.

30:44.704 --> 30:49.995
Bent as hairpins.
Occupational necessity.

30:50.168 --> 30:54.961
They have special classes
in corruption at night school.

30:56.342 --> 31:00.174
If you're suspected of honesty,
you're disbarred.

31:05.308 --> 31:09.853
I knew a lawyer fellow once.

31:10.023 --> 31:14.686
He got that Frenchman off.
La Roche.

31:18.031 --> 31:21.151
A big smuggler.

31:21.326 --> 31:24.660
200 kilos.

31:26.082 --> 31:30.791
He put enough bread
in enough pockets. Got bail.

31:30.962 --> 31:34.580
Vanished.

31:34.758 --> 31:39.634
- His name?
- Who?

31:39.805 --> 31:45.226
- The lawyer.
- Lawyer?

31:45.393 --> 31:50.103
Who got the Frenchman off.

31:51.984 --> 31:57.821
Yesil is his name.

31:59.701 --> 32:03.699
I don't know anything else
about him.

32:03.872 --> 32:07.289
Yesil.

32:09.170 --> 32:14.164
The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.

32:14.341 --> 32:18.754
- Yeah, but how?
- Catch the midnight express.

32:18.930 --> 32:22.097
Whas that?

32:24.727 --> 32:33.817
Is not a train.
Is a prison word for... escape.

32:38.492 --> 32:41.577
It doesn't stop around here.

33:28.588 --> 33:31.506
Dad, I'm sorry.

33:31.675 --> 33:34.878
Forget it.

33:35.053 --> 33:41.852
I'll punch you in the nose later.
We've got to get you out of here.

33:42.020 --> 33:46.728
This is a suit I brought for you.

33:47.984 --> 33:51.519
Smarten you up a little.

33:54.575 --> 33:58.785
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

33:58.953 --> 34:02.323
How's Mom?

34:02.499 --> 34:06.498
Well, she's bad.

34:06.671 --> 34:11.498
She couldn't make the trip.
You know Mom. Her boy...

34:14.344 --> 34:18.045
Susan told us
before we got your letter.

34:18.225 --> 34:21.428
She's saving to come back here...

34:21.603 --> 34:27.273
Don't let her come.
How's Rob? How's Peg?

34:27.443 --> 34:30.728
They're the same. You know.

34:30.904 --> 34:36.112
We told the neighbours
you were in hospital in Europe.

34:36.286 --> 34:42.788
This is Stanley Daniels.
He's the American Consul here.

34:42.958 --> 34:50.754
Billy, we're going to do everything
in our power to get you out of here.

34:50.926 --> 34:57.843
Thas Necdit Yesil,
the lawyer you asked for.

34:58.017 --> 35:02.182
I know exactly what you feel,
but you must not worry.

35:02.356 --> 35:06.567
We'll get the right court
and the right judge.

35:06.735 --> 35:10.187
I'll arrange everything, just right.

35:11.615 --> 35:18.032
I understand that if you get bail,
is easy to get across the border.

35:18.205 --> 35:24.575
Thas what we're shooting for.
I've spoken to the State Department.

35:24.753 --> 35:30.045
Right now, relations with the Turks
aren't too good. Nixon upset them.

35:30.218 --> 35:36.507
- Our best bet is right here.
- Dad, I'll pay you back for this.

35:36.684 --> 35:41.062
Money doesn't matter, Billy.
Not at this stage.

35:46.986 --> 35:53.026
- Where did you get that limp?
- I twisted my ankle.

35:53.202 --> 35:58.195
- Where are you staying?
- The Hilton.

35:58.374 --> 36:03.879
- How do you like Istanbul?
- Interesting place.

36:04.046 --> 36:09.504
The food is lousy. The crap
they sell in the restaurants...

36:09.678 --> 36:14.885
I had to run to the toilet.
You should have seen the toilet.

36:15.058 --> 36:22.437
I'll eat at the Hilton every night.
Steak, French fries and ketchup.

36:29.823 --> 36:32.990
Billy...

36:33.161 --> 36:39.496
- Why did you do it?
- Money.

36:40.752 --> 36:44.501
I know you kids smoke that stuff
and we drink booze, -

36:44.673 --> 36:48.968
- but taking it across the border,
thas stupid.

36:49.137 --> 36:51.591
I know.

36:51.764 --> 36:57.601
Dad... get me out of here.

36:57.771 --> 37:02.599
I promise you. Just sit tight.

37:02.777 --> 37:07.687
Let me work with Mr. Daniels
and Mr. Yesil here.

37:07.865 --> 37:11.115
We'll get you out, okay?

37:11.285 --> 37:15.235
Hey, Billy... Okay?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.456
Okay.

39:01.236 --> 39:05.733
- What did that prosecutor say?
- Is not important.

39:05.908 --> 39:11.247
We made our case. You spoke well.
The judge liked you.

39:30.267 --> 39:34.051
Mr. Hayes, the judge is coming back.

40:16.399 --> 40:20.446
- Four years, two months.
- Four years?

40:20.613 --> 40:22.689
We'll appeal.

40:22.865 --> 40:28.951
Ill be reduced for good behaviour.
It is only for possession.

40:29.122 --> 40:33.998
The prosecutor wanted
a life sentence for smuggling.

40:34.169 --> 40:39.709
To be honest, Mr. Hayes,
it is a great victory.

40:50.062 --> 40:56.479
With good time,
it works out to about three years.

40:56.652 --> 40:59.819
And then there's the appeal.

40:59.989 --> 41:08.412
Daniels and Yesil
are all working for you.

41:08.581 --> 41:12.365
We're trying to get you transferred.

41:12.543 --> 41:18.416
Daniels thinks there might be
a political amnesty any month now.

41:22.054 --> 41:25.969
All right, Billy...

41:26.142 --> 41:31.812
I know it sounds tough,
but we are going to get you out.

41:31.980 --> 41:37.320
I promise you.
Don't do anything stupid.

41:37.486 --> 41:41.188
They could play with your sentence.

41:42.993 --> 41:46.197
All right, now...

41:48.750 --> 41:55.168
I'm putting $500 in the bank.
Anything you need, you write.

41:55.340 --> 42:00.547
There's food here,
candy, writing paper, -

42:00.720 --> 42:08.052
- books, cigarettes, soap,
toothbrush...

42:13.442 --> 42:16.562
I've sold insurance for 30 years.

42:16.737 --> 42:20.356
Now I've got to see my own son...

42:20.533 --> 42:25.076
Jesus!

42:28.917 --> 42:36.000
If I could be where you are...
I'd be there.

42:38.760 --> 42:42.379
I love you, Dad.

43:12.130 --> 43:16.627
You take good care of my boy,
or I'll have your fucking head!

44:49.610 --> 44:55.779
Dear Susan,
1970 has now passed into 1971.

44:55.949 --> 44:59.948
You can drift in here
and never know you're gone.

45:00.122 --> 45:06.373
You can fade so far out, you
don't know where you are anymore.

45:06.544 --> 45:14.969
I find loneliness is a physical pain
that hurts all over.

45:46.378 --> 45:49.664
To the Turks
everything is "soyle boyle".

45:49.840 --> 45:53.792
It means "like this, like that."
You never know what will happen.

45:55.556 --> 45:59.885
All foreigners are "ayip."
They're considered dirty.

46:00.060 --> 46:05.221
So is homosexuality, but they
do it every chance they get.

46:05.399 --> 46:10.027
There are about 1,000 things
that are "ayip".

46:10.197 --> 46:15.439
You can stab or shoot somebody
below the waist but not above.

46:16.620 --> 46:21.911
Stabbing somebody in the ass
is considered Turkish revenge.

46:24.379 --> 46:29.502
I know it must sound crazy to you,
but this place is crazy.

46:36.140 --> 46:39.556
One day,
one of the new kids was raped.

46:39.727 --> 46:44.140
So they picked out
four of the worst kids.

48:14.996 --> 48:19.659
Then there's Rifki. The more
I know of him, the more I hate him.

48:19.835 --> 48:23.703
$10 for this shit? You pig.

48:23.881 --> 48:27.499
There are no pigs in Turkey.

48:27.677 --> 48:33.797
- This shit is shit.
- No, is good. Good shit.

48:33.975 --> 48:37.973
- You big shit.
- Yeah, me big shit.

48:57.208 --> 49:00.329
You asshole.

49:04.717 --> 49:09.379
What is it with you?
Just what the hell is it, man?

49:12.433 --> 49:16.301
You don't fuck with me,
I don't fuck with you.

49:16.479 --> 49:20.477
You fuck with me all the time.
You make crummy tea.

49:20.649 --> 49:27.698
- You rip us off on the hash.
- I make special tea for you.

49:27.867 --> 49:32.778
We have to live like brothers.
We have to be in here together.

49:32.956 --> 49:36.786
For all the money you've got,
you've got nothing.

49:36.959 --> 49:41.835
- You are American, you don't know.
- Know what?

49:42.006 --> 49:44.165
Dog eat dog.

49:44.342 --> 49:48.589
You fuck other man before he
fucks you. And you must fuck last.

49:57.023 --> 50:00.973
Come on down.

50:06.742 --> 50:13.575
Egbert...
Sodding cat.

52:43.826 --> 52:46.115
William!

52:46.287 --> 52:50.700
Are you all right?

52:50.876 --> 52:55.537
The new American Ambassador
is following your case.

52:55.713 --> 53:00.542
He says there is progress.
You want a cigarette?

53:01.303 --> 53:04.424
But there is another route...

53:06.475 --> 53:09.726
...that is quite possible.

53:09.896 --> 53:13.514
For a proper amount of money,
it is possible -

53:13.692 --> 53:18.438
- to convince the ten officials
to lose track of your papers -

53:18.614 --> 53:23.359
- before the High Court in Ankara
confirms your sentence.

53:23.535 --> 53:31.746
And you could be in Greece by
the time they discover the mistake.

53:34.339 --> 53:41.967
But I have to act before the
official sentence is handed down.

53:43.390 --> 53:50.556
And for that
I must pay certain officials.

54:02.868 --> 54:05.194
Whas that?

54:11.713 --> 54:16.624
The blueprints to the prison, man.

54:16.801 --> 54:22.922
There was this German architect
in the hospital.

54:23.099 --> 54:25.888
He let me copy them.

54:26.062 --> 54:30.106
Is too bad
you didn't have a Xerox machine.

54:31.525 --> 54:34.526
There are two ways out of here.

54:34.695 --> 54:39.773
One is over the roof,
but thas kind of risky.

54:39.951 --> 54:45.787
The other way, I'll need your help,
and that is under.

54:48.544 --> 54:50.832
A tunnel?

54:51.004 --> 54:56.877
- Are you serious?
- This is not Stalag 17.

54:57.052 --> 55:02.213
Thas where you're wrong.
The tunnel is already built.

55:02.391 --> 55:06.472
There's a basement
where they used to keep weapons.

55:06.646 --> 55:13.610
Beneath that are the catacombs the
Christians built to bury their dead.

55:13.779 --> 55:18.406
We're sitting
right on top of it... here.

55:19.453 --> 55:25.206
The kraut says that there's
a bunch of hollow shafts.

55:25.374 --> 55:29.752
They're like dumbwaiters,
all along these walls.

55:29.921 --> 55:33.919
One of them
is right next to our shower.

55:34.093 --> 55:37.792
If we get in there,
we can get down into the catacombs.

55:37.971 --> 55:41.921
With three of us working,
it shouldn't take too long.

55:42.101 --> 55:47.096
I swear I heard a couple of dead
Christians singing down there.

55:47.273 --> 55:54.486
- You stop shitting me, man. Okay?
- How do we get into the shaft?

55:54.656 --> 55:58.950
We knock three times and
say we're a friend of the deceased.

55:59.119 --> 56:04.955
I'm getting this together and
I don't need no gastro-head along.

56:05.125 --> 56:08.245
You understand me?

56:15.595 --> 56:20.092
- We go through the wall.
- We go through the wall?

56:21.893 --> 56:24.811
Go through the wall.

56:45.835 --> 56:51.292
There's no reinforced steel
in those shower walls.

56:51.466 --> 56:57.173
Is real soft
from underground seepage.

56:57.348 --> 57:00.681
You can almost push it over.

57:00.851 --> 57:04.138
All we have to do...

57:04.314 --> 57:09.474
We only have to use your screwdriver
to scrape the mortar out.

57:09.652 --> 57:13.567
We pull out three stones
and squeeze through...

57:22.917 --> 57:27.414
Squeeze through,
and get our ass down the shaft.

57:27.589 --> 57:32.299
- Is a two-night operation.
- What do we do in the catacombs?

57:32.469 --> 57:35.470
What do you want, a door?

57:35.638 --> 57:39.340
There's miles of them down there.

57:39.518 --> 57:44.513
- You must be fucking crazy.
- They've got to come up someplace.

57:44.690 --> 57:51.192
You won't find any catacombs,
you'll just finish up in section 13.

57:51.990 --> 57:57.863
Billy... the tunnel or the roof?

57:58.038 --> 58:01.657
Forget the wall.
Rifki's always there.

58:01.834 --> 58:07.753
- The roof is guarded.
- Help me get into the shaft.

58:07.924 --> 58:12.337
If we get caught,
I'll get the shaft.

58:12.512 --> 58:17.138
I'll be back up to
three years again, maybe more.

58:18.310 --> 58:23.020
Fuck it, then.
You choose your own death.

58:23.191 --> 58:28.648
I'll do this thing on my own.
I'm taking the roof out of here.

58:45.839 --> 58:49.042
No! I can't take it!

59:29.136 --> 59:32.837
Dear Susan,
Jimmy was caught and beaten badly.

59:33.015 --> 59:36.847
He got a severe hernia
and lost a testicle.

59:37.019 --> 59:40.720
He's been in the sanatorium
for months.

59:40.898 --> 59:45.062
In comparison,
my problems seem small.

59:45.236 --> 59:49.649
But 2 1/2 years have gone by.

59:49.824 --> 59:54.570
The Turks
are slowly draining my life away.

01:00:03.755 --> 01:00:11.337
- Why do you keep your hair short?
- To remind me that I hate it here.

01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:07.824
Prison, monastery, cloister, cave.

01:01:31.559 --> 01:01:34.514
Prison...

01:03:33.523 --> 01:03:39.776
- Okay.
- I've thought of another way.

01:03:39.947 --> 01:03:44.075
- Another way what?
- Out of here.

01:03:44.243 --> 01:03:49.949
When I was in the sanatorium,
there was only one guard on duty.

01:03:50.124 --> 01:03:54.703
- I could have got out of there.
- Why didn't you?

01:03:54.879 --> 01:04:00.170
As soon as I could walk,
they threw me back in here.

01:04:00.343 --> 01:04:04.803
- Lucky you.
- I tell you, Billy...

01:04:04.972 --> 01:04:10.098
Another ward in the sanatorium
had no guard on it at all.

01:04:10.270 --> 01:04:13.391
- Who was in it?
- Three guys.

01:04:13.566 --> 01:04:18.274
- What was wrong with them?
- I don't know.

01:04:19.404 --> 01:04:24.281
- I think they were dead.
- It figures.

01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:36.755
I've got to go. Is Daniels!
Turkish justice has done it again.

01:04:36.924 --> 01:04:43.010
They're going to let me off.
Jimmy, I'm going home!

01:04:43.181 --> 01:04:48.139
God! "I've got to go."

01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:08.158
Whas wrong?

01:05:08.333 --> 01:05:11.701
Sit down, Billy.

01:05:11.878 --> 01:05:17.003
I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

01:05:18.009 --> 01:05:22.304
- Is it Dad? Mom?
- No.

01:05:22.472 --> 01:05:28.842
- You're going to have a new court.
- What do you mean?

01:05:29.021 --> 01:05:34.064
The prosecutor objected
to your sentence for possession.

01:05:34.236 --> 01:05:38.779
He wanted a smuggling conviction.
The Ankara court reviewed it.

01:05:38.949 --> 01:05:45.320
It seems everyone wanted
an example made. A scapegoat.

01:05:48.001 --> 01:05:54.335
We've been notified
that they rejected the sentence.

01:05:55.633 --> 01:05:58.801
There were 35 judges in the court.

01:05:58.971 --> 01:06:02.839
28 voted for... a life sentence.

01:06:05.226 --> 01:06:10.103
The lower court in Istanbul
had to go along with the decision.

01:06:10.274 --> 01:06:15.233
The judge likes you.
He notified your dad.

01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:18.737
What do you mean, life?

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:23.155
- Life for what?
- Billy!

01:06:23.329 --> 01:06:28.704
I have 53 days left!

01:06:46.396 --> 01:06:50.097
So now is time for me to speak.

01:06:50.275 --> 01:06:54.226
What is there for me to say?

01:06:54.405 --> 01:06:59.991
When I finish,
you'll sentence me for my crime.

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:03.328
So let me ask you now:

01:07:03.498 --> 01:07:06.369
What is a crime?

01:07:06.543 --> 01:07:09.330
What is a punishment?

01:07:09.504 --> 01:07:15.756
It seems to vary from time to time
and place to place.

01:07:15.927 --> 01:07:22.097
Whas legal today
is suddenly illegal tomorrow.

01:07:22.268 --> 01:07:28.805
Whas illegal is suddenly legal
because everybody's doing it.

01:07:28.983 --> 01:07:32.981
You can't put everybody in jail.

01:07:33.822 --> 01:07:37.358
I'm not saying
this is right or wrong.

01:07:37.535 --> 01:07:42.446
I'm just saying
thas the way it is.

01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:49.829
I've spent 3 1/2 years of my life
in your prison.

01:07:50.007 --> 01:07:54.715
I think I've paid for my error.

01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:03.220
If is your decision today
to sentence me to more years...

01:08:18.118 --> 01:08:23.660
My lawyer... thas a good one.
He says, "Be cool, Billy."

01:08:23.834 --> 01:08:30.252
"Be good. I'll get you a pardon,
an amnesty, an appeal."

01:08:30.966 --> 01:08:36.341
This has been going on now
for 3 1/2 years.

01:08:36.514 --> 01:08:41.971
I've been playing it cool.
I've been good.

01:08:43.273 --> 01:08:51.184
Now I'm damn tired of being good.
You said I had 53 days left.

01:08:51.363 --> 01:08:58.611
You hung 53 days in my face,
and then you took them away.

01:08:58.787 --> 01:09:01.493
And you!

01:09:01.666 --> 01:09:05.996
I wish you could be standing
where I'm standing right now.

01:09:06.171 --> 01:09:10.216
Then you would know something
that you don't know.

01:09:10.384 --> 01:09:13.301
Mercy!

01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:21.051
You would know that a just society
is based on the concept of mercy.

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:24.479
Its sense of fair play and justice.

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:30.904
But I guess thas like asking
a bear to shit in a toilet.

01:09:42.085 --> 01:09:47.292
For a nation of pigs,
it sure is funny you don't eat them.

01:09:56.058 --> 01:10:01.645
Jesus Christ forgave the bastards,
but I can't.

01:10:04.776 --> 01:10:09.484
I hate.

01:10:09.655 --> 01:10:12.361
I hate you.

01:10:12.533 --> 01:10:17.611
I hate your nation
and I hate your people.

01:10:17.789 --> 01:10:23.709
I fuck your sons and daughters
because they're pigs.

01:10:23.879 --> 01:10:26.501
You're a pig.

01:10:31.887 --> 01:10:35.552
You're all pigs.

01:10:57.208 --> 01:11:02.996
My hands are tied by Ankara.

01:11:08.677 --> 01:11:13.672
I must sentence you, William Hayes,
to be imprisoned -

01:11:13.849 --> 01:11:16.969
- for a term no less than 30 years.

01:11:19.313 --> 01:11:22.932
May it pass quickly.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:51.299
Got the old Istanbul blues

01:11:51.474 --> 01:11:54.973
Istanbul blues

01:11:55.144 --> 01:12:00.684
they give me 30 years

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:04.939
ain't got nothing left to lose...

01:12:05.113 --> 01:12:10.071
We are going to get you out.
I promise you.

01:12:10.243 --> 01:12:15.915
Don't do anything stupid.
They could play with your sentence.

01:12:21.297 --> 01:12:25.758
I was busted at the border...

01:12:25.927 --> 01:12:31.088
The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.

01:12:31.266 --> 01:12:34.966
The best way you can.

01:13:13.143 --> 01:13:17.605
Hey, I think I found it.
Come here.

01:13:18.901 --> 01:13:23.148
Listen to that.
Do you hear anything?

01:13:26.116 --> 01:13:30.328
I told you, you suckers.
You didn't believe me.

01:13:30.495 --> 01:13:34.031
Keep it down.

01:13:36.628 --> 01:13:40.542
Look how soft this is.
Ill be easy.

01:13:40.715 --> 01:13:48.546
Go and get Rifki's poker,
but don't wake him up.

01:14:06.034 --> 01:14:11.242
Is really soft. Is coming.

01:14:15.294 --> 01:14:19.162
- Jimmy, is coming.
- Here, use this.

01:14:22.343 --> 01:14:27.469
Is coming real easy.
Is coming right out.

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:32.931
Is easier than I thought.
Is a piece of cake.

01:14:43.324 --> 01:14:46.526
Is coming.

01:14:46.701 --> 01:14:49.408
Like butter.

01:14:50.499 --> 01:14:55.660
Hey, Max. Rifki.

01:15:11.647 --> 01:15:15.395
- Keep checking for Rifki.
- Is okay.

01:15:30.499 --> 01:15:35.791
- Watch it.
- I thought you wanted out of here.

01:15:38.883 --> 01:15:43.676
- They're loose.
- Les try.

01:15:43.847 --> 01:15:47.548
- Watch your hernia.
- Fuck that.

01:15:53.066 --> 01:15:57.111
- Okay? You got it?
- Yeah.

01:16:03.994 --> 01:16:09.237
Thas it. Is the shaft.

01:16:16.132 --> 01:16:18.754
Is coming.

01:16:25.725 --> 01:16:29.675
Is okay.

01:16:36.069 --> 01:16:41.147
- Les go, Billy.
- Is too late. We're not prepared.

01:16:41.325 --> 01:16:44.991
We'll go tomorrow.
Is too late.

01:16:45.163 --> 01:16:48.365
Les put them back. Help me.

01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:17.978
Any fuck-ups
and we should be back by dawn.

01:17:18.156 --> 01:17:22.106
You got everything?

01:17:22.287 --> 01:17:27.197
Maps, railroad, bus timetables.

01:17:27.374 --> 01:17:31.075
Okay, les do it.

01:18:33.695 --> 01:18:37.111
- Can you see?
- No.

01:18:52.716 --> 01:18:57.296
Come on, Max,
get your ass down here.

01:18:58.682 --> 01:19:02.680
This way to Istanbul, baby.

01:19:07.274 --> 01:19:11.568
Watch it.
Mind how you go there.

01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:20.234
Are you all right?
Come down this pole and cross over.

01:19:21.539 --> 01:19:25.039
Terrific.

01:19:28.671 --> 01:19:33.001
- All right, is a tunnel.
- Les go.

01:19:56.451 --> 01:19:59.488
Come on, Max.

01:20:09.173 --> 01:20:12.839
Fuck! What is that? Shit!

01:20:28.819 --> 01:20:35.652
Shit! Is a dead end.
The Turks must have blocked it up.

01:20:35.826 --> 01:20:39.077
Shit!

01:20:41.708 --> 01:20:44.116
Billy!

01:20:46.923 --> 01:20:51.169
- What the fuck are we going to do?
- What time is it?

01:20:51.343 --> 01:20:54.878
4:30.

01:20:57.141 --> 01:21:03.560
- Go back.
- You must be fucking joking.

01:21:03.732 --> 01:21:09.023
We go back, seal it up,
and come back tomorrow.

01:21:09.196 --> 01:21:13.360
Every night, until we get out.

01:21:13.534 --> 01:21:17.532
There's got to be a way out.

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:36.130
Billy, they found it. Rifki.

01:22:16.727 --> 01:22:19.931
No do, no do.

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:47.459
I'm going to kick your brains
all over your fucking kitchen.

01:22:47.635 --> 01:22:51.086
Fine! Good. Man to man.

01:22:51.263 --> 01:22:58.263
When we're finished, I'll bring
Hamidou and he'll kick your ass.

01:23:00.315 --> 01:23:03.351
Les go, Max. Come on.

01:23:12.662 --> 01:23:17.205
- I know what I'm going to do.
- What?

01:23:17.375 --> 01:23:21.539
- I'm going to cut his throat.
- Whose?

01:23:21.713 --> 01:23:24.750
Rifki.

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:34.434
What have I got to lose?
Anyway, I'd really enjoy it.

01:23:37.647 --> 01:23:43.816
Why don't you sit down?
You're in no shape to kill anybody.

01:23:43.987 --> 01:23:49.444
- I want to cut his fucking throat.
- Is already been cut.

01:23:55.791 --> 01:23:59.124
Then I'll cut his balls off.

01:24:03.215 --> 01:24:08.423
You know, if you really
wanted to hurt Rifki...

01:24:10.014 --> 01:24:16.019
His money. Steal that
and you steal his life's blood.

01:24:16.772 --> 01:24:21.649
Could you see his face if everything
he had got snatched?

01:24:21.819 --> 01:24:25.983
- If we only knew where he hid it.
- I know where it is.

01:24:26.991 --> 01:24:29.447
Max...

01:24:31.246 --> 01:24:34.033
The money?

01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:40.171
Them that hides can find, says I.

01:24:44.677 --> 01:24:48.626
I've seen him, the big tit.

01:24:50.933 --> 01:24:55.929
He looks at it, late at night.

01:24:59.067 --> 01:25:02.768
Talking to it.

01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:06.818
Where?

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:13.289
Max, where?

01:25:15.501 --> 01:25:18.669
The money, where?

01:25:21.175 --> 01:25:27.843
In his radio.
In the back of his radio.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.144
Thas why he never plays it.

01:27:33.232 --> 01:27:37.730
- He never had one.
- Soon he's back on the street.

01:27:37.905 --> 01:27:44.619
No friends, no money,
plenty of enemies.

01:27:44.786 --> 01:27:48.155
- I'll drink to that.
- Me, too.

01:27:50.334 --> 01:27:57.546
- I've just got some news on Jimmy.
- Really? What?

01:27:57.717 --> 01:28:02.877
They sent him to hospital.
They ruptured his hernia again.

01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:09.676
- Shit!
- I guess he didn't talk.

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:18.193
- Look at Rifki, wearing a suit.
- Maybe he's got a new job.

01:28:27.124 --> 01:28:29.200
Jesus! Not again.

01:29:14.424 --> 01:29:16.797
Hashish.

01:29:33.988 --> 01:29:37.819
You're kidding! Me?

01:29:42.747 --> 01:29:46.329
I didn't sell him anything.

01:29:58.471 --> 01:30:02.386
Rifki's lying. He's a liar!

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.573
Rifki!

01:34:22.964 --> 01:34:26.000
Cigare, cigare, s'il vous plait.

01:34:41.066 --> 01:34:44.602
Please, listen to me.

01:36:36.775 --> 01:36:42.812
Excuse me, I've been wanting
to speak to you. You're an American?

01:36:42.988 --> 01:36:47.319
Yes, America.
My name is Ahmet.

01:36:47.494 --> 01:36:53.081
I studied philosophy at Harvard,
and also at Oxford.

01:36:53.249 --> 01:36:58.375
I also studied in Vienna,
and now I study here.

01:36:58.547 --> 01:37:03.256
They put me here.
They say I raped a little child.

01:37:03.428 --> 01:37:07.805
They'll never let me go.
They won't let you go, either.

01:37:07.973 --> 01:37:13.763
They tell you they'll let you go,
but in fact you stay.

01:37:13.938 --> 01:37:19.609
You see, we all of us
come from a factory.

01:37:19.778 --> 01:37:24.737
Sometimes the factory makes
bad machines that don't work.

01:37:24.908 --> 01:37:29.405
The bad machines
don't know they're bad machines.

01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:36.829
But the factory knows you are one
of the machines that doesn't work.

01:37:37.005 --> 01:37:41.668
I think we've spoken enough
for today.

01:37:41.844 --> 01:37:44.679
I wish you goodnight.

01:39:27.123 --> 01:39:30.207
My God!

01:39:34.922 --> 01:39:36.963
Billy!

01:39:40.721 --> 01:39:44.968
What have they done to you?

01:39:49.522 --> 01:39:53.140
Your family is fine.

01:39:55.988 --> 01:40:00.696
Senator Buckley has made
a special plea on your behalf.

01:40:00.867 --> 01:40:05.577
They've called you a pawn in the
game between Nixon and the Turks.

01:40:05.748 --> 01:40:10.042
The letters are coming in.
People do care.

01:40:16.967 --> 01:40:20.633
What?

01:40:20.805 --> 01:40:23.379
Take it off.

01:40:23.558 --> 01:40:30.973
- You'll just make yourself...
- Take it off.

01:40:34.319 --> 01:40:36.858
S'il vous plait.

01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:14.480
Billy...

01:41:16.574 --> 01:41:23.111
I wish I could make it better
for you. Please, don't.

01:41:25.374 --> 01:41:28.044
Don't.

01:41:42.393 --> 01:41:47.351
- Susan.
- Yes, Billy.

01:41:47.523 --> 01:41:51.438
I love you.

01:41:55.866 --> 01:41:59.401
I love you.

01:42:07.128 --> 01:42:10.746
Your father gave me this for you.

01:42:10.923 --> 01:42:15.918
There's pictures of your mom
and dad, and Rob and Peg.

01:42:16.095 --> 01:42:21.850
And in the back there's a picture
of your old friend Mr. Franklin.

01:42:23.187 --> 01:42:26.602
Remember him? From the bank.

01:42:28.358 --> 01:42:33.270
He's over in Greece now.
He bought a ticket.

01:42:36.242 --> 01:42:41.699
I'll give it to them for you.

01:42:41.874 --> 01:42:47.663
Don't count on them.
Don't count on anyone but yourself.

01:42:56.514 --> 01:43:00.975
You're running out of time.
If you stay here, you'll die.

01:43:01.144 --> 01:43:07.349
You've got to get yourself together.
You've got to get out of here.

01:44:47.884 --> 01:44:51.467
Good morning, my American friend.

01:44:51.639 --> 01:44:56.347
There will be trouble
if you go this way.

01:44:56.517 --> 01:45:00.563
A good Turk
always walks to the right.

01:45:00.730 --> 01:45:05.559
Left is Communist.
Right is good.

01:45:08.530 --> 01:45:13.323
You must go the other way.

01:45:13.494 --> 01:45:16.863
The other way is good.

01:45:19.292 --> 01:45:23.372
Where are you going?
Why don't you walk the wheel?

01:45:23.546 --> 01:45:28.375
What is the matter,
my American friend?

01:45:32.473 --> 01:45:36.422
A bad machine
doesn't know he's a bad machine.

01:45:36.601 --> 01:45:42.475
You still don't believe
you're a bad machine?

01:45:42.650 --> 01:45:45.770
To know yourself is to know God.

01:45:45.945 --> 01:45:50.655
The factory knows,
thas why they put you here.

01:45:50.826 --> 01:45:56.865
- In time you'll know.
- I already know.

01:45:57.041 --> 01:46:02.996
You are a bad machine, thas why
the factory keeps you here.

01:46:03.172 --> 01:46:06.090
Do you know how I know?

01:46:06.259 --> 01:46:11.052
I know because I'm from the factory.

01:46:11.223 --> 01:46:14.259
I make the machines.

01:48:48.891 --> 01:48:53.020
Max.

01:48:55.107 --> 01:48:58.108
Max!

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:08.907
I'm going away.
I've come to say goodbye.

01:49:10.623 --> 01:49:15.831
You see, if I stay here,
I'm going to die.

01:49:16.004 --> 01:49:20.714
You'll die. Don't die, Max.

01:49:20.885 --> 01:49:24.752
Please, don't die.

01:49:24.930 --> 01:49:28.430
I'm going to come back for you.

01:49:28.601 --> 01:49:32.849
You hang on for me.

01:51:28.104 --> 01:51:33.644
You're not taking me
to the sanatorium!
