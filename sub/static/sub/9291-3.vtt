00:14.240 --> 00:16.239
- Who's this?
- My name is Jack Bauer.

00:16.320 --> 00:21.280
I work for Secretary of Defense Heller.
He was kidnapped less than half an hour ago.

00:21.360 --> 00:24.360
I believe the same people
that kidnapped him are chasing you now.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.960
The safest thing for you to do
is let me bring you in.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.560
- I found out who stumbled onto our server.
- Is he with you now?

00:30.640 --> 00:33.840
- "No. I'll have him shortly."
- Find out who he's talked to.

00:33.920 --> 00:38.160
- Who are you?
- I'll kill you if you don't follow my orders.

00:38.560 --> 00:43.320
This is a simple task, Behrooz. But these
are the ones where mistakes can be made.

00:43.400 --> 00:46.960
- Debbie, what are you doing here?
- I followed you.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.840
Omar saw you with someone
outside the compound.

00:51.920 --> 00:54.280
She didn't see anything. I made sure of it.

00:54.360 --> 00:58.160
We've spent years planning for this,
waiting for this day to come.

00:58.240 --> 01:01.360
Now it's here
and you've compromised everything.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.879
It's a simple job.
You pick up the subject and bring him in.

01:04.959 --> 01:07.440
Bauer has not been in the field
for a year and a half.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.040
Which is why I need you
to keep him on a tight leash.

01:10.120 --> 01:13.680
For the record, I think Driscoll
made a mistake letting you come.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.760
You get the gate. I'll get the kid out of the car.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.840
My father is the secretary of defense.

01:31.920 --> 01:36.360
Richard, you are the only witness
to your father and your sister's kidnapping.

01:36.440 --> 01:40.640
We need your help.
You don't have anything to hide, do you?

01:41.040 --> 01:45.280
- " We'll be fine. We're still on US soil.
- What are they gonna do?

01:45.360 --> 01:49.440
I don't know, but if they wanted me dead,
they would have killed me at Richard's house.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.640
Our soldiers have taken
the terrorist James Heller into custody.

01:53.720 --> 01:58.200
In three hours, Heller will be tried
for war crimes against humanity.

01:58.280 --> 02:03.520
If he is proven guilty, he will be executed
in accordance with our laws.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.840
Sir.

02:20.000 --> 02:25.120
As you know, the secretary of defense and his
daughter have been kidnapped by terrorists.

02:25.200 --> 02:30.520
The terrorists have announced that they'll put
Jim on trial for war crimes, then execute him,

02:30.960 --> 02:34.440
all of it broadcast for the world.

02:34.520 --> 02:38.360
Make no mistake.
This country is under attack.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.520
Foreign terrorists are operating on our soil.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.600
Intelligence indicates that
the kidnapping may be some kind of trigger.

02:45.680 --> 02:49.080
The first step in a series of larger attacks.

02:49.160 --> 02:52.200
Mark, what kind of
protective actions are being taken?

02:52.280 --> 02:55.640
We've changed all the codes
the secretary has knowledge of.

02:55.720 --> 02:58.280
The other cabinet members
have been sequestered.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.400
Melissa, where are we with keeping
these people from broadcasting this?

03:02.480 --> 03:04.960
The media outlets will not air it,

03:05.040 --> 03:09.680
but the terrorists have announced that
they'll use the Internet. We can't control that.

03:09.760 --> 03:13.800
Their feed is untraceable,
and we can't shut down the Internet

03:13.880 --> 03:17.520
without disabling the functions
of the government and the economy.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.160
Mr President,
the only way to stop this is at the source.

03:21.240 --> 03:26.880
- "We have to rescue Secretary Heller."
- Erin, where is CTU on this?

03:26.960 --> 03:30.560
We have search teams out in force.
We're working a few active leads.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.280
- "Anything promising?"
- "We'll know very shortly."

03:33.360 --> 03:35.760
Keep us closely posted.

03:38.120 --> 03:44.080
Nothing takes priority over finding the people
who have Jim Heller, and stopping them.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.160
Thank you.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.400
- Where are we with Heller's son?
- Finding out what he knows.

03:59.480 --> 04:03.680
If he had anything to do with his father's
abduction, we need to know. Get on it.

04:03.760 --> 04:08.240
- Try his emergency frequency.
- Where's Ronnie and Bauer with the witness?

04:08.320 --> 04:09.760
- We don't know.
- What?

04:09.840 --> 04:13.840
I just spoke to transit police.
A hostile intercepted Andrew Paige.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.680
- We can't reach Ronnie or Jack.
- What do you mean?

04:16.760 --> 04:22.600
They're not answering their phones. There's
been a report of a shooting at the station.

04:22.680 --> 04:27.480
Get pictures of Andrew Paige to our people.
And set up a security grid around the station.

04:27.560 --> 04:31.160
- My system's logged on. I can get it faster.
- All right, fine.

04:31.240 --> 04:35.720
You'll do tactical with me. Let's go, Edgar.

04:35.800 --> 04:40.120
Edgar Stiles.
Miss Driscoll, Jack Bauer's on line one.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.400
Where are you?
Why have you not been in contact?

04:43.480 --> 04:46.640
- Erin, Ronnie's been killed.
- What are you talking about?

04:46.720 --> 04:51.440
He was shot by a hostile
who kidnapped Andrew Paige.

04:51.520 --> 04:55.360
- Where are you now?
- I'm tracking them, but he doesn't know it.

04:55.440 --> 04:58.880
- I'll send backup.
- Erin, I don't think that's the right call.

04:58.960 --> 05:02.520
I believe that they'll lead me
to Heller and the kidnappers.

05:02.600 --> 05:07.440
Listen to me. The terrorists will try
and execute Heller in less than three hours.

05:07.520 --> 05:11.800
- Bring the man in now.
- This is our best chance of finding him.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.120
- Jack, we had a deal.
- You're breaking up.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.440
Have SWAT and rescue teams standing by.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.640
I'll call you when the hostile
reaches his destination.

05:21.880 --> 05:26.960
- That call. Do you have a location?
- No, it had a block on it.

05:29.080 --> 05:33.160
I've been informed that Ronnie Lobell
has been killed in the line of duty

05:33.240 --> 05:35.960
by a hostile connected to Heller's abduction.

05:36.040 --> 05:40.760
At this point, Jack Bauer is no longer
cooperating with this investigation.

05:40.840 --> 05:45.800
All departments need to work on the capture
of Jack Bauer and the hostile he's tracking.

05:45.880 --> 05:49.040
Reconfigure the grid
to include routes from the station.

05:49.120 --> 05:52.120
I want all ground teams on this.

05:58.960 --> 06:01.800
" MTA, downtown."

06:01.880 --> 06:06.360
This is CTU. Do you have any new
information about the kid who was abducted?

06:06.440 --> 06:08.520
We told you everything a few minutes ago.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.640
I can access surveillance cams
if you give me the port codes.

06:11.720 --> 06:15.600
We're looking at them right now.
There's nothing.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.560
Thanks.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.800
- Yes?
- "What are you doing there?"

06:23.880 --> 06:26.800
- "I need you to help me with this grid."
- "What kind of help?"

06:26.880 --> 06:29.840
- The northeast quadrant is pass-coded...
- "Pilot L one."

06:29.920 --> 06:32.440
- What?
- "That's the log in."

06:32.520 --> 06:37.200
- Chloe, could you just get back here?
- I'm trying to find my friend Andrew.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.440
Get down!

07:02.880 --> 07:04.840
- Yes?
- " I have the programmer."

07:04.920 --> 07:08.760
Good. We need to know
what he told CTU as soon as possible.

07:08.840 --> 07:10.960
- "Proceed as planned."
- Understood.

07:11.040 --> 07:14.120
- There was a problem at the train station.
- What?

07:14.200 --> 07:17.280
- An agent interfered, I killed him.
- Are you being pursued?

07:17.360 --> 07:21.200
No. Anyone who left the station after me
would have caught up to me by now.

07:21.280 --> 07:25.280
Unless they don't want you to know
they're there. Take precautions.

07:25.360 --> 07:29.160
Make sure that
you are not being followed. Go.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.400
Move!

08:36.039 --> 08:38.600
Dad.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.320
You OK?

08:44.720 --> 08:47.280
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.680
They just wanted me present
while they broadcast an announcement.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.880
- They're gonna put me on trial.
- For what?

08:54.960 --> 08:59.240
- Crimes against humanity.
- That's ridiculous. When?

08:59.320 --> 09:01.760
Less than three hours.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.880
Jack and the president will do everything
they can. They may get here before then.

09:07.960 --> 09:11.920
I can deal with anything
these bastards have got for me.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.480
I wish you hadn't
come this morning, that's all.

09:18.560 --> 09:23.240
This is a list of the offences
you are being charged with.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.880
Sign it.

09:28.560 --> 09:33.240
I'm a senior member of the United States
Government. I'm not signing it.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.960
Then you will die, Mr Secretary.

09:40.040 --> 09:43.640
Pick up the document and sign it.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.400
- No!
- Let her go!

09:53.480 --> 09:56.440
Leave her alone, you son of a bitch!
Leave her alone!

09:56.520 --> 09:59.720
- Kill her!
- All right. All right, I'll sign it.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.600
Pick up the document.

10:06.960 --> 10:09.040
Pick it up!

10:11.200 --> 10:13.080
Dad.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.040
- Where are we on finding Bauer?
- So far, nowhere.

10:43.120 --> 10:46.480
- That's unacceptable.
- We're working up everything we can.

10:46.560 --> 10:50.160
- What are you doing to find Heller?
- I'll find out what his son knows.

10:50.240 --> 10:53.160
- Sarah's working on the forensics.
- Anything new yet?

10:53.240 --> 10:55.320
- No.
- " Great. What else?

10:55.400 --> 10:58.120
- Sarah Gavin.
- I'm tracing the terrorist webcast.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.240
- And?
- I can't get into the file.

11:00.320 --> 11:05.360
- In other words, nothing.
- Miss Driscoll, it's the president.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.520
Make something happen.

11:11.280 --> 11:14.920
- Yes, Mr President?
- I understand you lost a field operative.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.600
Yes, we did.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.240
Were there any witnesses or prisoners?

11:19.320 --> 11:22.600
- Not yet, but there's some hope.
- Tell me.

11:22.680 --> 11:27.240
Jack Bauer, who, as you know, used
to work here, is currently trailing a suspect.

11:27.320 --> 11:31.360
- Trailing? Why doesn't he bring him in?
- We're in the process of doing that.

11:31.440 --> 11:37.600
Erin, are we going to be able to save Jim
and his daughter before this "trial" starts?

11:37.680 --> 11:40.040
I certainly hope so, sir.

11:40.120 --> 11:44.440
Mr President, I have to ask you something
now, as we may not have time later.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.600
What?

11:45.680 --> 11:51.360
We may end up in a situation where we have
Heller's location, but can't extract him safely.

11:51.440 --> 11:56.800
If that's the case, would you authorise
in advance an all-out assault?

11:56.880 --> 12:00.160
The assumption being
that the secretary would not survive?

12:00.240 --> 12:02.040
Correct.

12:03.480 --> 12:07.240
We'll cross that bridge
if the scenario presents itself.

12:07.320 --> 12:10.240
- Yes, sir.
- "Goodbye, Erin."

12:16.560 --> 12:18.960
- Manning.
- Hey, Curtis, it's Marianne.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.920
- I know you're busy with the kidnapping.
- Yes, I am.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.160
My friend said you're calling in
level-five consultants.

12:25.240 --> 12:29.840
- We added personnel because of the crisis.
- She said you struck my name from the list.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.840
- You don't meet the criteria.
- Don't give me that.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.000
I have the qualifications.
Why did you exclude me?

12:36.080 --> 12:39.320
You want it straight?
I don't think we'd work well together.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.640
Why? Because we slept together
and you stopped calling me?

12:42.720 --> 12:46.920
I stopped calling you because you were
using me to get ahead in your career.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.840
That's your interpretation.
You didn't have a problem at the time.

12:50.920 --> 12:54.000
- I'm not having this conversation.
- I'll have it with Erin.

12:54.080 --> 12:57.560
- Marianne.
- This would be a huge opportunity for me.

12:57.640 --> 13:02.440
And I'm not gonna let you get in the way
because you're uncomfortable.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.320
Where should I post those FBI bulletins?

13:05.400 --> 13:07.520
Exit three.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.560
- O'Brian.
- " It's me. Can you talk?"

13:23.640 --> 13:26.440
- What happened with Andrew?
- Someone got to him.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.000
Did you tell anyone
where we were meeting him?

13:29.080 --> 13:33.440
No. What are you doing? Driscoll said
you're operating outside her authority.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.280
- She's not handling this right.
- What if you're wrong?

13:36.360 --> 13:40.520
- This is our best chance of finding Heller.
- If anything happens to Andrew...

13:40.600 --> 13:45.160
- Chloe, we have to find these terrorists.
- So why are you calling me?

13:45.240 --> 13:49.880
The hostile's headed toward the canyons.
I need satellite surveillance to track him.

13:49.960 --> 13:53.000
You want me to steal
satellite bandwidth from CTU.

13:53.080 --> 13:56.080
- Yes.
- Where are you?

13:56.160 --> 14:01.760
I'm on Orchard Road, just north
of the 14, about four miles east of Valencia.

14:01.840 --> 14:07.040
Caltrans has traffic cams in the area. You'll
need satellite coverage nearer the canyons.

14:07.120 --> 14:11.680
Call me back as soon as you've got
the coverage. I'll keep a private channel open.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.640
- Who was that?
- It was personal.

14:21.080 --> 14:25.040
- Something wrong?
- I'm not sure. Chloe's acting kinda strange.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.440
That's nothing new.

14:38.120 --> 14:42.520
- Hey. What do you need?
- I just spoke to Marianne Taylor.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.480
Erin, whatever she told you,
it's coming from a very disturbed place.

14:46.560 --> 14:50.840
That may be, but she's as qualified
as any of the others you brought in today.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.920
I'm not comfortable with her.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.600
- That should be enough.
- Normally, it would be.

14:55.680 --> 15:00.960
She mentioned that your pillow talk included
a synopsis of the new data-mining protocols.

15:01.040 --> 15:06.680
That's a lie. If she got that information, it was
from someone else. She's using it against me.

15:06.760 --> 15:11.640
She knows details about the new UVX system.
That's classified information.

15:11.720 --> 15:16.080
She can force us into a security reboot
and a six-month investigation.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.480
- I don't believe this.
- I asked her to come in.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.520
Deal with it.

15:25.600 --> 15:29.120
Do you have the results
on Secretary Heller's son yet?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.000
Yeah.

15:31.840 --> 15:35.760
The polygraph shows he had
no knowing involvement in the kidnapping.

15:35.840 --> 15:36.840
But?

15:36.920 --> 15:40.680
He insists he didn't tell anyone
his father was coming to his house.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.800
The polygraph
was inconclusive on that claim.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.280
- You think he's lying?
- It's possible.

15:46.360 --> 15:49.520
Richard was the only one
who knew where his father would be,

15:49.600 --> 15:52.160
and he may have told someone about it.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.560
Why would Richard protect
somebody who's betrayed him?

15:55.640 --> 16:01.080
Because he's too arrogant
to believe that's what's happened.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.560
It'll take days
to go through his phone records.

16:05.640 --> 16:09.160
I want you to see if you can
get the name out of him another way.

16:09.240 --> 16:12.640
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

16:13.400 --> 16:18.800
- Erin, we're not sure he's guilty of anything.
- This is how we'll find out. Get started.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.880
Did Father talk to you about Debbie?

17:04.960 --> 17:07.160
What about her?

17:09.800 --> 17:14.240
When Dad told me
to take the briefcase to Omar...

17:14.319 --> 17:19.119
Debbie followed me. She didn't know
where I was going, she just wanted to talk.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.240
Debbie saw the warehouse
where we're holding Heller?

17:22.319 --> 17:24.960
Yes, but there wasn't anything
I could do about it.

17:25.040 --> 17:29.200
You could have broken up with her
a month ago like your father and I told you to.

17:29.280 --> 17:34.120
I know I made a mistake, but Father found out
and he wants me to get her over here.

17:34.200 --> 17:39.760
You know what that means. If he thinks
there's a chance she could expose us...

17:42.720 --> 17:46.520
I didn't realise you felt so strongly about her.

17:48.520 --> 17:52.720
She's not going to mess anything up.
I swear to you.

17:57.440 --> 18:01.120
- What do you want me to do?
- Talk to him.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.760
He'll listen to you.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.560
Please.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.400
OK.

18:08.480 --> 18:12.120
Your father is on his way to a meeting.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.800
I'll try to reach him.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.920
Thanks, Mom.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.480
- When can I get outta here?
- Secure him.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.800
Goddammit! What the hell are you doing?

18:50.880 --> 18:54.240
Get your hands off me! Argh! Argh!

19:03.640 --> 19:06.440
Who else knew your father
would be at your house?

19:06.520 --> 19:08.960
I told you, no one.

19:18.040 --> 19:21.840
- What are you? Crazy?
- "This works on a neurotransmitter level."

19:21.920 --> 19:24.840
Makes every nerve ending feel like it's on fire.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.960
You're bluffing.
You know you can't get away with this.

19:28.040 --> 19:32.360
By the time you're released, the mark
will be gone. It'll be your word against mine.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.520
My father's the secretary of defense,
for God's sake.

19:35.600 --> 19:39.000
I thought you hated him.
Now he's dear old Dad.

19:43.640 --> 19:47.280
Help me! Somebody! Please!

19:47.360 --> 19:49.840
Help me!

19:55.720 --> 19:57.320
Stop.

20:19.160 --> 20:22.760
I can't do it, Erin.
I'm not gonna let Eric work on Richard Heller.

20:22.840 --> 20:25.120
- Why not?
- Maybe he's protecting a friend,

20:25.200 --> 20:28.520
but he wasn't knowingly involved
with the terrorists.

20:28.600 --> 20:33.080
- I gave you an order.
- Then give it to me in writing, Erin.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.520
- What are you suggesting? We release him?
- No.

20:36.600 --> 20:39.080
Sensory disorientation gives good results.

20:39.160 --> 20:44.640
Cut off his sight, saturate his auditory.
It's noninvasive.

20:44.720 --> 20:46.440
Fine.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.240
Try it.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.320
- Yes.
- " I spoke with Behrooz."

20:52.400 --> 20:56.600
He told me about his girlfriend.
He's very upset, Navi.

20:56.680 --> 21:01.240
That's what concerns me. He has feelings
for this girl despite what he tells us.

21:01.320 --> 21:06.000
- Now she's seen the warehouse.
- I know. It's very troubling.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.120
I told him to get her over to the house.
Did he make the call?

21:09.200 --> 21:12.280
No. He asked me to talk to you instead.

21:14.680 --> 21:17.720
- " Go upstairs.
- Are you talking to Father?

21:17.800 --> 21:20.800
- I'll talk to you soon.
- You'll take care of this?

21:20.880 --> 21:23.680
- Yes.
- "Thank you."

21:26.800 --> 21:31.320
What did he say? Do I still
have to call Debbie and get her over here?

21:31.400 --> 21:32.920
No.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.720
Thank you, Mother.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.320
I'm gonna pull over soon
and we're gonna talk, OK?

21:59.400 --> 22:01.000
Mm-hm.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.600
Good.

22:04.040 --> 22:07.560
There are some things I need you to know.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.760
Today is not about me or you.

22:10.840 --> 22:14.360
It's about something bigger.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.800
What I need to know is that
whatever you saw on the Internet

22:17.880 --> 22:21.080
will not interfere with what we have planned.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.680
You have to convince me of that.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.920
Yeah?

23:11.000 --> 23:14.400
It will be a while on the satellite.
The load is through the roof.

23:14.480 --> 23:19.280
- How much longer?
- I'm not sure. What is your position exactly?

23:19.360 --> 23:21.960
The suspect pulled over
just past mile-marker 31.

23:22.040 --> 23:23.920
Why? There's nothing there.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.080
I don't know. I gotta go. Get back to me
as soon as you got the satellite coverage.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.960
Get up.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.880
" Nobody! Nobody!

24:35.320 --> 24:37.400
- Jack, I'm watching this.
- How?

24:37.480 --> 24:39.960
On a traffic cam. You've gotta stop this.

24:40.040 --> 24:43.760
If I intercede now, we lose
our opportunity to find Secretary Heller.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.920
What did you tell CTU?

24:46.000 --> 24:49.280
That someone was going to put
positioning code on the Internet.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.520
- What else?
- I tried to dig deeper,

24:51.600 --> 24:56.800
but everything was in some kind of Arabic.
I couldn't read it.

24:56.880 --> 25:00.800
- That's all you told CTU?
- Yes. I promise.

25:01.880 --> 25:03.840
Argh!

25:04.720 --> 25:07.880
- Are you sure?
- Jack, stop them. Just stop them.

25:09.880 --> 25:15.880
That's all I know. I swear, I promise.
Please, just don't hit me any more. Please.

25:24.960 --> 25:29.840
I talked to the programmer. He didn't tell
CTU enough for them to be able to stop us.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.400
- Are you sure?
- Yes. He only got a brief glimpse of the code.

25:33.480 --> 25:35.640
He was never logged on to our server.

25:35.720 --> 25:40.240
I need you here. Get back on the road.
Have them see what else they can find out.

25:40.320 --> 25:44.200
- And then get rid of the body.
- I will see you soon.

25:47.120 --> 25:49.520
" Talk!

25:51.240 --> 25:53.800
Chloe, how do you open
a secure pipe to Division?

25:53.880 --> 25:56.200
- Ask Edgar.
- I did. He's busy.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.080
- I'm busy.
- Why are you so impatient with everybody?

25:59.160 --> 26:03.240
Not everybody, just you.
Now, please go away.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.320
Bitch.

26:10.720 --> 26:13.440
- What's happening?
- I've got to follow the hostile.

26:13.520 --> 26:17.400
Jack, you can't leave Andrew there.
They'll kill him. Jack!

26:17.480 --> 26:20.560
Jack, please! Jack?

26:54.040 --> 26:56.280
Jack?

26:57.160 --> 26:59.840
- Jack?
- Yeah?

27:00.800 --> 27:05.440
- Is Andrew alive?
- Yes. Dispatch an ambulance to this location.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.880
Get me the damn satellite coverage.

27:31.200 --> 27:37.200
That's right. Just off the road next to the
31 mile-marker. Get there as fast as you can.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.840
What's wrong?

28:48.440 --> 28:53.320
When the trial begins,
you may have an opportunity to escape.

28:53.400 --> 28:57.320
You have to take it, even if it's dangerous.

28:58.400 --> 29:03.920
- Maybe we'll have a chance before then.
- They'll never take their eyes off of me.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
It has to be when their attention is on the trial.

29:10.080 --> 29:13.680
- I don't want to get out of here without...
- Forget about me.

29:13.760 --> 29:17.840
You have to take every chance. Promise me.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.920
Dad, I... I... I can't.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.240
Yes, you can. You can.

29:22.320 --> 29:24.800
I want you to live your life.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.240
A full life.

29:28.120 --> 29:30.880
I want you to have a family.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.760
That's all I care about.

29:34.840 --> 29:37.120
You're my baby.

29:40.600 --> 29:44.360
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can. You can do it.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.520
Come on, now.

30:10.680 --> 30:14.280
- Chloe, you want me to get that?
- No. O'Brian.

30:14.360 --> 30:18.320
- " Chloe, it's me."
- I was looking at the CHP dispatch report.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.920
Andrew is in really bad shape.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.880
I will never forgive you. Do you hear me?

30:23.960 --> 30:27.120
I understand how you feel,
but you've gotta think clearly.

30:27.200 --> 30:31.840
We have terrorists who bombed a train
and kidnapped the secretary of defense.

30:31.920 --> 30:35.400
We have to follow this hostile
and hope he leads us to Heller.

30:35.480 --> 30:38.360
No. I'm not listening to you any more.
This is over.

30:38.440 --> 30:41.040
- I'm going to Driscoll.
- No. You know I'm right.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.240
No, I don't.

30:44.240 --> 30:49.360
Chloe, if you didn't believe in what I was
doing, you'd have turned me in already.

30:55.080 --> 30:58.280
- I hate that this is happening.
- So do I.

30:59.160 --> 31:04.640
Chloe, I can't do this without you.
I need your help to stop them.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.520
- "Chloe."
- What?

31:07.240 --> 31:09.640
Are you with me?

31:11.920 --> 31:15.600
Yeah. I'll call as soon as I have the satellite.

31:15.680 --> 31:18.080
- "Thank you."
- Yeah.

31:28.160 --> 31:32.800
- Miss Driscoll, this is Marianne Taylor.
- Thank you. Ms Taylor.

31:32.880 --> 31:36.200
I'm very excited to have
this opportunity to help you here.

31:36.280 --> 31:38.800
- Hello, Curtis.
- Marianne.

31:38.880 --> 31:44.400
Curtis, take Marianne to an empty station
and get her started on the data sorts.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.200
Let's go.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.400
You'll be working over here.

31:52.480 --> 31:57.000
You know, Curtis, I didn't want to go
over your head, but you left me no choice.

31:57.080 --> 32:01.000
- Is that so?
- I'll let it go if you will.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.920
Get to work, Marianne.

32:15.920 --> 32:19.080
- Is there a problem?
- No. Why?

32:19.160 --> 32:22.400
- What are you working on?
- A Division protocol manifest.

32:22.480 --> 32:26.440
I need you to build a firewall
around station four.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.400
- Who's that?
- Marianne.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.200
I want to make sure
she doesn't stray from her area.

32:31.280 --> 32:34.360
Fine.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.920
- O'Brian.
- " What's going on?"

32:38.000 --> 32:40.440
- I don't think I can do this, Jack.
- Why?

32:40.520 --> 32:44.920
I'm spread too thin. I've got to get a satellite
on an overloaded system. I need more time.

32:45.000 --> 32:49.160
We don't have it. In five minutes
we'll be on Route 11. It's a two-lane road.

32:49.240 --> 32:54.440
We'll be the only cars for miles. There's
no way I can follow him without being seen.

32:54.520 --> 33:00.200
All right. I think I know a way
I can speed this up. I'll get back to you.

33:21.600 --> 33:24.720
The satellite system tanked
and Driscoll wants these updates.

33:24.800 --> 33:27.360
OK, I'll be right there.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.480
I hope Driscoll doesn't get upset.
She overreacts sometimes.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.600
This happened to me a few days ago.

33:39.680 --> 33:43.080
You can retrieve your files
from the backups in the server room.

33:43.160 --> 33:45.160
Good idea.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.199
- Yeah?
- " I stole a block of time."

34:08.280 --> 34:11.679
There's no continuous coverage.
I'll have to order a reposition.

34:11.760 --> 34:17.360
Fine, then do it. Hold on. We're catching
a break. He's pulling into a gas station.

34:17.440 --> 34:21.280
Well, I hope he stays there a while.
This will take some time.

34:21.360 --> 34:25.440
- Get back to me as soon as you've got it.
- OK, I will.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.360
- Edgar?
- Yeah.

34:53.440 --> 34:57.200
I'm Marianne Taylor. Driscoll asked me
to help on data and logistics.

34:57.280 --> 34:59.640
I heard something about that. Hi.

34:59.720 --> 35:03.440
- So can you do me a favour?
- A favour?

35:03.520 --> 35:07.840
Yeah. Everyone's busy. I'd be more useful
if I had an overall on what's going on.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.440
The secretary of defense has been kidnapped.

35:10.520 --> 35:14.160
- I know. I mean tactically.
- I don't have time for this. I'm busy.

35:14.240 --> 35:18.120
- Why don't you give me the main points?
- All right.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.120
- We think Bauer's following a terrorist.
- "We think"?

35:21.200 --> 35:25.440
- Yeah. He's off on his own. We can't find him.
- I thought he didn't work here.

35:25.520 --> 35:29.120
He doesn't. Driscoll gave him
the authority to do this one thing.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.800
All right. Thanks, Edgar.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.080
Richard.

36:20.960 --> 36:23.520
How long do you think it's been?

36:23.600 --> 36:25.240
What?

36:25.320 --> 36:29.800
How long do you think
you've been sitting here like this?

36:29.880 --> 36:32.360
Three, four hours.

36:38.080 --> 36:40.880
It's been less than 30 minutes.

36:40.960 --> 36:47.040
Time's the first thing you lose track of
in sensory disorientation. It only gets worse.

36:47.120 --> 36:50.920
This is illegal. You can't keep me here.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.560
- Tell me what I need to know.
- I told you everything I know.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.960
Your father was kidnapped by terrorists.

36:58.040 --> 37:02.320
Our analysis shows that you're hiding
something that might help us find him.

37:02.400 --> 37:08.320
- Just tell me what it is and all this stops.
- You're not going to do this.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.760
If you don't care enough
about your father to tell me,

37:11.840 --> 37:14.560
I'll get it out of you this way.

37:23.760 --> 37:26.760
You're not gonna do this!

37:26.840 --> 37:30.040
Please! Stop!

37:30.120 --> 37:32.560
You're not gonna...

37:36.720 --> 37:38.920
Argh!

37:39.000 --> 37:41.960
Stop it! Stop it!

37:43.000 --> 37:44.520
Stop it!

37:55.480 --> 37:57.320
O'Brian.

37:57.400 --> 38:02.360
- " How long for the satellite reposition?"
- My request is still in the queue.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.000
We've got to get
that coverage up and running.

38:05.080 --> 38:09.480
There's nothing I can do. You'll have
to stall him. It'll take as long as it takes.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.920
- Just hurry.
- OK, I will.

38:22.640 --> 38:24.960
Why is Debbie here?

38:25.040 --> 38:29.880
- What did you do?
- I called her and asked her to come over.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.920
You said that you would help me.
That you talked to Father.

38:33.000 --> 38:36.240
Your father is right.
We need to find out who she told.

38:36.320 --> 38:40.840
- I told you she didn't see anything.
- Then there shouldn't be any problem.

38:40.920 --> 38:45.520
- What did you say to her?
- That I was concerned about the two of you.

38:46.480 --> 38:48.440
- Mom.
- Behrooz...

38:49.040 --> 38:51.440
You know what's at stake.

38:51.520 --> 38:55.080
You do as you're told. Understand?

39:02.760 --> 39:05.520
- Debbie, thank you for coming.
- Sure.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.080
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.720
Come in.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.880
Debbie, please...

39:16.920 --> 39:21.720
make yourself comfortable in the living room.
I'll make tea.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.120
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
I'm glad your mom called.

39:31.080 --> 39:34.960
- If she has problems with us we should talk.
- Debbie.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.600
- What's wrong?
- You don't understand.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.680
You shouldn't have come here.

39:43.160 --> 39:46.360
Why do you always say things like that?

40:15.800 --> 40:17.760
O'Brian.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.040
Will I have satellite coverage
in the next minute or two?

40:21.120 --> 40:23.280
It'll take at least five.

40:23.360 --> 40:25.720
- That's too long.
- That's the best I can do.

40:25.800 --> 40:31.800
Dammit. I'm gonna have to figure out a way
to keep this guy here. Keep working on it.

41:18.120 --> 41:21.960
Everybody put your hands up now!
You, don't move.
