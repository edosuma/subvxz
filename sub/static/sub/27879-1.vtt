WEBVTT

00:30.320 --> 00:31.153
Sit down.

00:35.170 --> 00:37.713
You and I are here right
now for two reasons.

00:39.490 --> 00:40.323
One,

00:41.880 --> 00:43.230
somebody really fucked up

00:44.430 --> 00:45.263
and two,

00:47.020 --> 00:49.720
you wanna make sure that
everyone knows that they did.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.713
Let's get one thing
straight before we begin.

01:01.810 --> 01:03.339
My people

01:03.340 --> 01:05.013
are not assassins.

01:07.360 --> 01:10.029
This job isn't done from a mile away

01:10.030 --> 01:12.630
out of a third story window

01:13.500 --> 01:15.850
by some soft-bodied shooter

01:16.810 --> 01:18.053
wearing camouflage.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.160
We understand that this is personal.

01:33.830 --> 01:35.120
What we have to offer

01:36.590 --> 01:38.153
is more valuable than a bullet.

01:40.540 --> 01:42.459
What we have to offer

01:42.460 --> 01:44.192
is a message.

01:51.230 --> 01:52.847
He's stolen from you.

01:58.254 --> 01:59.837
He blackmailed you.

02:02.670 --> 02:03.797
He embarrassed you.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.710
And by the morning,

02:08.960 --> 02:10.908
everyone will know.

02:16.210 --> 02:18.283
My people are not quiet.

02:21.260 --> 02:23.435
My people are not clean.

02:31.653 --> 02:33.417
Look at me.

02:37.101 --> 02:38.046
Open your eyes.

02:38.047 --> 02:39.259
Open your eyes.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.093
My people

02:42.120 --> 02:43.240
are bad people

02:45.490 --> 02:48.044
and they love what they do.

03:08.817 --> 03:10.203
And most importantly,

03:11.250 --> 03:12.083
my people

03:13.370 --> 03:14.203
do not

03:15.320 --> 03:16.949
make

03:16.950 --> 03:17.813
mistakes.

03:20.790 --> 03:21.862
I know.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.573
How much time do I have?

03:34.760 --> 03:35.593
To do what?

03:38.320 --> 03:39.153
Survive?

03:55.458 --> 03:56.541
To see you.

04:05.522 --> 04:08.343
What am I gonna do with you, Set?

04:16.269 --> 04:17.503
20 minutes, on the roof.

04:25.010 --> 04:25.843
And Set,

04:28.540 --> 04:30.423
don't forget to tip the doorman.

07:34.113 --> 07:35.793
You know why we're up here?

07:39.090 --> 07:40.833
We're up here because a shooter,

07:41.930 --> 07:42.763
piece of shit,

07:44.440 --> 07:46.653
is only paying attention to my window.

07:56.570 --> 07:58.263
Where as I am only watching him.

08:07.510 --> 08:08.610
All right, boss man.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.863
Where is your little stray?

08:14.896 --> 08:15.764
No, no, no, no.

08:15.764 --> 08:16.597
No, no, no, no.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.430
Relax.

08:17.431 --> 08:18.969
Hey, relax, you guys called me.

08:18.970 --> 08:20.409
You called me.

08:20.410 --> 08:21.495
All right, fuck this.

08:37.640 --> 08:38.940
She do that to your lip?

08:44.808 --> 08:46.309
I hope you realize how serious it is

08:46.310 --> 08:47.560
when they bring shooters in.

08:49.380 --> 08:50.999
If my bosses are hiring shooters,

08:51.000 --> 08:53.089
it means one of two things.

08:53.090 --> 08:53.923
One,

08:55.200 --> 08:57.100
they want the retribution to be swift.

08:58.030 --> 08:58.863
Or two,

09:01.490 --> 09:03.079
they don't want you putting
anymore of our friends

09:03.080 --> 09:03.980
out of commission.

09:08.620 --> 09:10.070
I assume you met the doorman.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.593
Shit.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.263
I stalled.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.263
Didn't even tell them where you were yet.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.113
Well,

09:28.950 --> 09:30.332
when he doesn't check in,

09:30.333 --> 09:32.213
they'll call me to handle it.

09:34.320 --> 09:35.483
I don't miss calls.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.389
When that phone rings,

09:39.390 --> 09:41.123
the order goes out statewide.

09:48.040 --> 09:49.940
You do know what you did wrong, right?

09:55.940 --> 09:57.363
Yeah, I suppose you do.

10:04.010 --> 10:05.459
Look, Set,

10:05.460 --> 10:07.211
you need to go now.

10:08.520 --> 10:09.353
Where?

10:12.420 --> 10:14.009
Some place secluded.

10:14.010 --> 10:16.263
Away from the bulk of our freelancers.

10:18.230 --> 10:19.580
Spread out your hits a bit.

10:21.130 --> 10:22.559
East coast? Chicago?

10:22.560 --> 10:23.393
No.

10:23.394 --> 10:24.399
Arizona.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.059
Arizona?

10:26.060 --> 10:27.323
Big, open,

10:28.270 --> 10:29.719
not as crowded.

10:29.720 --> 10:30.553
Lots of desert.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.023
I'm supposed to hide there?

10:34.100 --> 10:35.499
You need to be able to see around you

10:35.500 --> 10:37.853
in all directions at all times.

10:40.190 --> 10:41.340
You're not hiding, Set.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.269
You're surviving.

10:44.270 --> 10:46.739
It's a six hour drive into the desert.

10:46.740 --> 10:49.751
My advice, make it a twelve hour one.

10:49.752 --> 10:52.133
Pace your trip, keep them guessing.

10:58.770 --> 10:59.603
Good luck, Set.

11:01.898 --> 11:04.170
We're coming for you.

11:46.613 --> 11:47.446
I'm in the ring, I'm in the ring.

11:47.447 --> 11:50.089
I'm doing my thing, one-two, one-two.

11:50.090 --> 11:50.923
Know what I'm saying,

11:50.924 --> 11:52.959
he had a nice jab on him.

11:52.960 --> 11:54.349
He don't have a lot of power behind him

11:54.350 --> 11:57.419
but it's a pretty cool jab,
you know what I'm saying?

11:57.420 --> 11:58.400
Slip it.

11:58.401 --> 11:59.859
Upper cut to the body, hook to the head.

11:59.860 --> 12:00.873
Boom, down.

12:01.752 --> 12:02.585
Know what I'm saying?

12:02.585 --> 12:03.418
It was good, right?

12:05.330 --> 12:06.553
Al.

12:06.554 --> 12:07.879
Al.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.409
Hey, what're you doing?

12:09.410 --> 12:10.649
What the fuck?

12:10.650 --> 12:12.223
You sitting around here
waiting for something to happen,

12:12.224 --> 12:14.119
I didn't want you to be bored.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.520
Quit screwing around.

12:20.697 --> 12:23.799
What is wrong with you, huh?

12:23.800 --> 12:25.650
We won the fight, we're getting paid.

12:30.380 --> 12:31.213
Finally.

12:32.540 --> 12:33.373
Yeah.

12:33.373 --> 12:34.206
Uh huh.

12:36.510 --> 12:37.893
Well did the bet go through?

12:39.190 --> 12:40.023
It did.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.649
Great.

12:42.650 --> 12:44.000
So can we expect the money.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.451
Yeah, I'm gonna check, I'm going home.

12:50.172 --> 12:51.666
Come on, kid, let's go.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.333
Forget the fries!

12:53.333 --> 12:54.166
You've had half of it already.

12:54.167 --> 12:55.614
Come on, let's get out of here.

12:55.615 --> 12:57.109
Come on.

14:31.667 --> 14:33.069
Hi, my name's Rose.

14:33.070 --> 14:34.429
I could really use a ride.

14:34.430 --> 14:35.939
That's not an option, I've got water.

14:35.940 --> 14:36.773
Oh, thank you.

14:39.410 --> 14:40.243
I got it.

14:41.210 --> 14:42.043
Oh my God, are you okay?

14:42.044 --> 14:43.299
No, I'm fine.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.639
Let me help.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.909
Your face, let me help you.

14:45.910 --> 14:47.133
I said I'm fine.

14:49.770 --> 14:50.833
You poor thing.

14:58.660 --> 15:01.309
I've been there, I've
been there a dozen times.

15:01.310 --> 15:03.013
Are you coming out here to leave him?

15:06.770 --> 15:07.603
Good for you.

15:08.750 --> 15:11.000
I understand that this
is a time to be alone.

15:12.010 --> 15:14.060
I'm actually running from someone myself.

15:16.530 --> 15:17.699
It's okay.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.050
Thanks again for the water.

15:20.770 --> 15:21.623
Good luck, girly.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.700
Hope to see you again.

15:24.920 --> 15:25.823
I'll remember you.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.130
Never forget a face.

20:27.713 --> 20:29.563
I'll remember you.

20:30.470 --> 20:31.600
Never forget a face.

20:39.751 --> 20:40.951
Get up!

20:45.958 --> 20:46.791
Good girl!

22:35.470 --> 22:37.529
Did Handsome check in this morning?

22:37.530 --> 22:39.513
Handsome checked out this morning.

22:43.710 --> 22:46.789
An hour earlier, he reported
a civilian casualty.

22:46.790 --> 22:48.373
She was nowhere to be found.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.093
She buried his victim.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.619
In any case, sir,

22:56.620 --> 22:59.270
Handsome was the heaviest
hitter we had out that far.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.052
I don't wanna waste time here.

23:05.053 --> 23:07.693
I already did enough of that
by giving her the head's up.

23:09.025 --> 23:10.929
Who's our top freelancer?

23:10.930 --> 23:12.173
Local to that region?

23:14.550 --> 23:16.239
Did I say local?

23:16.240 --> 23:17.389
No, sir.

23:17.390 --> 23:19.339
Internationally, it's Ghetty,

23:19.340 --> 23:21.111
by a huge margin.

23:25.101 --> 23:26.219
But he poses a risk...

23:26.220 --> 23:28.319
How soon can we get him?

23:28.320 --> 23:29.609
He's on a job in England,

23:29.610 --> 23:31.110
so it'd take a couple of days.

23:33.930 --> 23:34.763
Okay.

23:36.430 --> 23:37.513
Offer him his full.

23:39.300 --> 23:40.140
Then put out a pin.

23:40.141 --> 23:43.787
Let's go open season for
half of what we'd pay Ghetty.

23:45.540 --> 23:48.793
We should still have a few
solid freelancers out there.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.599
Maybe one of them can save us some money.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.999
Arizona is more of a gunman's market.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.505
You want shooters too?

24:02.500 --> 24:04.203
No shooters.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.227
She deserves better than that.

24:13.180 --> 24:15.109
You wanna post up at the hospital?

24:15.110 --> 24:16.439
Someone to guard the girl's room?

24:16.440 --> 24:17.273
No.

24:19.220 --> 24:20.270
Set doesn't know yet.

24:22.590 --> 24:25.293
Even if she did, she's 400
miles away with no friends.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.300
She'd never make it back in time.

27:33.688 --> 27:34.521
Hi.

29:46.813 --> 29:49.396
Sam, can you check the stove?

30:05.987 --> 30:07.033
How was class?

30:09.250 --> 30:11.079
You're supposed to turn the knob on low,

30:11.080 --> 30:12.319
not off, silly.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.264
Let it simmer.

30:13.264 --> 30:14.097
I'm pretty sure you're
not supposed to boil water

30:14.098 --> 30:15.593
and then go take a shower.

30:16.610 --> 30:18.529
Loads of people do that.

30:18.530 --> 30:20.580
Plus, I had to get the work smell off me.

30:23.570 --> 30:24.579
What're you looking at?

30:24.580 --> 30:25.619
Bruise patterns.

30:25.620 --> 30:26.453
What?

30:27.466 --> 30:29.409
The patterns in which
bruises are formed.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.893
Okay, you are such a
smart ass, it's not cute.

30:33.050 --> 30:34.617
Just see for yourself.

30:39.797 --> 30:42.889
God, Samuel, why can't
you just look at porn,

30:42.890 --> 30:43.863
like normal people?

30:45.082 --> 30:46.549
I'm trying to help someone.

30:46.550 --> 30:48.029
With what?

30:48.030 --> 30:49.109
Homework?

30:49.110 --> 30:51.539
I saw someone that looks just like this.

30:51.540 --> 30:53.259
I just wanted to know what causes bruises

30:53.260 --> 30:54.959
and hers look like this.

30:54.960 --> 30:57.549
Wait, you met a girl
who looked like that?

30:57.550 --> 30:58.530
Yeah.

30:58.531 --> 31:00.259
Well, actually, no.

31:00.260 --> 31:01.093
I mean, I didn't meet her.

31:01.094 --> 31:02.800
I didn't physically shake her hand.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.019
Maybe you should just let this one go.

31:07.020 --> 31:08.520
Not if maybe I can help her.

31:09.710 --> 31:11.287
Come on, Dana, if you saw
her face you would get it.

31:11.288 --> 31:14.059
No, I get it, Samuel, I do, really.

31:14.060 --> 31:16.859
But you're not a fighter.

31:16.860 --> 31:19.299
Call the police, drop a tip.

31:19.300 --> 31:21.109
For all you know, she's
knee deep in a divorce

31:21.110 --> 31:23.663
and the guy responsible is behind bars.

31:26.610 --> 31:28.033
Do something, set the table.

35:26.628 --> 35:28.198
Hey!

35:28.199 --> 35:30.267
Hey!

35:30.268 --> 35:31.369
Hey!

35:31.370 --> 35:33.549
You should know that
hitting girls is wrong

35:33.550 --> 35:35.099
or hitting anybody is wrong.

35:35.100 --> 35:37.429
I don't now if you're her
boyfriend or her husband

35:37.430 --> 35:38.719
or whatever you are

35:38.720 --> 35:42.079
but you should go, all right?

35:42.080 --> 35:43.030
I'll call the cops.

35:44.030 --> 35:45.827
In fact, I've actually
already called the cops.

35:45.828 --> 35:47.163
So you should just leave.

35:49.990 --> 35:51.929
Relax, friend.

35:51.930 --> 35:53.403
I'm not anybody's boyfriend.

35:54.250 --> 35:55.469
I don't know what you're talking about

35:55.470 --> 35:56.829
but you sound pretty serious.

35:56.830 --> 35:58.683
So how about I give you a hand?

36:00.630 --> 36:03.129
Would you mind lowering
the flashlight, please?

36:03.130 --> 36:06.465
My eyes, they're sensitive to the light.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.460
Sorry, man.

36:13.618 --> 36:15.481
Oh, it's fine.

37:37.741 --> 37:40.281
Hey, where were you?

37:40.282 --> 37:42.365
Oh my God, what happened?

37:43.470 --> 37:44.789
Samuel, talk to me, what happened?

37:44.790 --> 37:45.733
Are you hurt?

37:46.706 --> 37:47.633
It's not mine.

37:48.584 --> 37:50.803
Oh my God, let's go to the kitchen.

38:05.237 --> 38:06.154
Oh, shit.

38:08.570 --> 38:09.670
How did you find me?

38:11.330 --> 38:13.113
You know, you're a
lot smaller in person.

38:14.340 --> 38:15.423
Like a little rat.

38:16.880 --> 38:17.713
Pretty though,

38:18.800 --> 38:21.389
if you like that tenderized look.

38:25.950 --> 38:27.509
Okay.

38:27.510 --> 38:28.773
I take it back.

38:30.730 --> 38:32.759
You're not pretty anymore.

38:32.760 --> 38:33.603
I guessed.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.670
The pin didn't say you was
a freelancer, I guessed.

38:38.520 --> 38:39.573
It was the pictures.

38:40.710 --> 38:42.460
Yeah, you definitely killed before.

38:43.701 --> 38:44.943
It's in the eyes.

38:46.730 --> 38:48.749
Fuck you, fist jockey!

38:48.750 --> 38:52.429
Always looking down your damn
noses at us like we're scum.

38:52.430 --> 38:54.759
We're all killers, bitch.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.360
We just have the sense to
do it in the 21st century.

38:58.890 --> 39:00.803
You freelancers are animals.

39:01.800 --> 39:05.209
And the way you catch an
animal is you hire a hunter.

39:05.210 --> 39:06.549
Your people would've floundered around

39:06.550 --> 39:08.829
for days looking for you.

39:08.830 --> 39:12.139
All I had to do was think like one of you.

39:12.140 --> 39:15.947
Like a scared little fucking rat!

39:18.060 --> 39:18.893
Fuck you!

39:21.230 --> 39:22.359
Kill me now or let me go,

39:22.360 --> 39:24.083
you're dead in 24 hours anyway.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.900
I didn't pick up your pin, I
hacked in, you little slut!

39:30.600 --> 39:31.650
But someone else did.

39:32.580 --> 39:33.819
Yeah.

39:33.820 --> 39:36.520
You caught the attention of
a real big fucking animal.

39:37.932 --> 39:39.482
You take my word for it, honey.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.323
You got no idea what's coming for you.

39:44.547 --> 39:46.207
No idea.

39:55.467 --> 39:58.039
If you had half a brain, you'd let me go!

39:58.040 --> 39:59.259
Because what I do to you with my gun

39:59.260 --> 40:01.883
is gonna be like a mercy
compared to what he's gonna do!

40:03.142 --> 40:04.635
You come back here and
look at me in my face,

40:04.636 --> 40:06.296
you fucking animal!

40:27.863 --> 40:29.053
This is crazy.

40:30.360 --> 40:31.193
Yeah.

40:32.620 --> 40:34.769
Should I call the cops?

40:34.770 --> 40:35.603
No.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.369
I mean, if you would've
stayed in your car, yes,

40:38.370 --> 40:39.203
but you didn't.

40:40.410 --> 40:42.210
Went and got mixed up in everything.

40:43.695 --> 40:45.639
Last thing I want is for you to be around

40:45.640 --> 40:46.690
these kind of people.

40:48.860 --> 40:49.693
No.

40:51.665 --> 40:53.763
I think you should just
stay away from her.

40:55.879 --> 40:57.199
But what if she needs my help?

40:57.200 --> 40:58.629
No.

40:58.630 --> 41:00.489
She was just protecting herself.

41:00.490 --> 41:01.579
You don't know that.

41:01.580 --> 41:03.269
Yes I do.

41:03.270 --> 41:06.499
She didn't even show up
until he tried to shoot me.

41:06.500 --> 41:07.619
Sam, stop!

41:07.620 --> 41:09.389
You have no idea what she would've done

41:09.390 --> 41:10.540
if you would've stayed.

41:12.330 --> 41:14.330
I can't tell you how glad I am

41:14.331 --> 41:17.479
that you were helping
someone, really I am.

41:17.480 --> 41:19.853
And I am so happy that you're okay.

41:20.740 --> 41:21.690
So then just let me...

41:21.691 --> 41:23.219
But listen!

41:23.220 --> 41:24.649
There's something you need to understand

41:24.650 --> 41:26.149
about people like her.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.643
They don't live in the
same world as you and I.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.126
We live our life trying to be good,

41:32.127 --> 41:34.533
trying to help people, not hurt them.

41:35.570 --> 41:36.713
But lives like hers,

41:37.820 --> 41:39.569
they're toxic.

41:39.570 --> 41:40.863
They end up in tragedy.

41:42.230 --> 41:44.973
You can't kill someone
and be normal after.

41:47.900 --> 41:50.460
I don't know what that
girl has been through

41:52.800 --> 41:53.713
but, honestly,

41:55.300 --> 41:57.000
any humanity she had

41:58.340 --> 41:59.173
is gone.

42:01.030 --> 42:01.863
I'm sorry.

42:47.230 --> 42:48.759
Come on, we should be celebrating!

42:48.760 --> 42:50.223
We should be leaving.

42:52.394 --> 42:53.539
No.

42:53.540 --> 42:56.359
Not until the transfer's
completed and confirmed.

42:56.360 --> 42:58.453
Well I'm celebrating anyway.

43:03.910 --> 43:05.583
Hey, slow down.

43:07.770 --> 43:08.819
Did you see the look
on the referee's face

43:08.820 --> 43:10.779
when I didn't slow down?

43:10.780 --> 43:12.492
That's how you know, they pay them too.

43:12.493 --> 43:14.449
See, they don't trust the
fighters to stay down anymore,

43:14.450 --> 43:16.019
so they cut the refs in.

43:16.020 --> 43:16.973
Added insurance.

43:18.250 --> 43:19.420
Imagine his face.

43:20.590 --> 43:21.840
Think he still gets paid?

43:23.170 --> 43:24.239
Judging by these numbers,

43:24.240 --> 43:26.883
it looks like we're the only
ones getting paid tonight.

43:28.483 --> 43:29.976
Go-Rilla!

43:29.977 --> 43:30.810
Go-Rilla!

43:31.727 --> 43:32.710
Here it is, folks,

43:32.711 --> 43:34.829
Rilla was down, but hears
the crowd chanting his name

43:34.830 --> 43:37.043
and he gets back up
and he's fighting hard.

43:38.260 --> 43:39.319
And would you look at the face

43:39.320 --> 43:40.979
on that stupid, fucking referee!

43:40.980 --> 43:42.159
Hey!

43:42.160 --> 43:45.039
I hope you realize how
fucking serious this is!

43:45.040 --> 43:46.199
By tomorrow morning,

43:46.200 --> 43:47.889
we're gonna have some
very influential people

43:47.890 --> 43:49.227
looking for our heads!

43:49.228 --> 43:51.399
So put down the drink,

43:51.400 --> 43:52.999
get your clothes or whatever you need.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.359
I got the car running outside.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.890
I want you out there in five
minutes, you understand?

44:19.240 --> 44:20.073
Okay.

44:21.320 --> 44:22.709
Okay.

44:22.710 --> 44:23.673
Wait for my word.

44:26.740 --> 44:28.999
I'm going to assume that
that wasn't good news.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.223
Good and bad.

44:31.730 --> 44:36.189
A shooter located Set last
night from inside my network.

44:36.190 --> 44:39.599
Shooter confirmed dead,
presumably at her hands.

44:39.600 --> 44:42.269
Authorities located his car but
apparently there was a noose

44:42.270 --> 44:44.163
I could give a shit about his car.

44:47.150 --> 44:48.889
I hope that's not the good news.

44:48.890 --> 44:50.019
No, sir.

44:50.020 --> 44:54.189
We have a local freelancer,
serious heavyweight, interested.

44:54.190 --> 44:55.743
He sent me a bid this morning.

44:57.830 --> 45:00.769
What kind of asshole bids back at us?

45:00.770 --> 45:02.730
You remember Alexander Marks?

45:06.450 --> 45:07.283
The cowboy?

45:10.020 --> 45:10.853
What's he asking?

45:10.854 --> 45:13.266
Two points over what we're offering.

45:14.541 --> 45:17.312
Oh, you bloodsucker.

45:17.313 --> 45:18.146
Slight problem, though.

45:18.147 --> 45:20.763
Oh, you mean other than the price?

45:21.650 --> 45:24.199
When I said serious
heavyweight, I meant it.

45:24.200 --> 45:27.009
He's got a lot of
influence in that market.

45:27.010 --> 45:28.999
Word got out that Marks
was bidding on her.

45:29.000 --> 45:31.803
Now nobody's touching it
until he's had his go.

45:32.790 --> 45:35.440
Unless you want to wait for
one of our Mexico agents,

45:36.510 --> 45:37.573
Marks has the bid.

45:41.440 --> 45:44.179
There was never any room
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit

45:44.180 --> 45:45.843
when I was taking contracts.

45:47.250 --> 45:48.363
Wild West, sir.

45:52.260 --> 45:53.799
Okay.

45:53.800 --> 45:56.500
Enough of this tiptoeing
around shit, here's the deal.

45:57.660 --> 45:58.710
You accept his offer.

46:00.250 --> 46:03.263
You tell him that he's got till
12:30 to complete the kill.

46:04.800 --> 46:08.069
And if we don't hear
back from him by 12:31,

46:08.070 --> 46:09.923
I'm talking about a phone call,

46:10.840 --> 46:13.229
we're sending in all
kinds of fuck-off shooters

46:13.230 --> 46:15.905
to kill everything, him included!

47:04.090 --> 47:04.925
It's not what you think!

47:04.925 --> 47:05.883
Ow!

47:05.883 --> 47:06.751
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

47:06.751 --> 47:07.658
Wait!

47:07.658 --> 47:08.491
Wait! Wait!

47:08.491 --> 47:09.370
Stop! Stop! Stop!

47:09.371 --> 47:10.518
I can explain! I can explain!

47:13.220 --> 47:14.593
Ow, I hurt my head.

47:17.517 --> 47:19.343
Oh, God, calm down!

47:21.090 --> 47:22.561
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

47:23.780 --> 47:25.286
Who are you?

47:25.287 --> 47:26.339
I'm Samuel.

47:26.340 --> 47:27.919
I'm just Samuel.

47:27.920 --> 47:29.569
You're not a shooter,
you're not a freelancer,

47:29.570 --> 47:30.714
what are you?

47:31.620 --> 47:32.620
I'm none of those things!

47:32.621 --> 47:34.229
I'm not any of that!

47:34.230 --> 47:35.943
Why are you following me?

47:37.500 --> 47:38.609
I wanna help.

47:38.610 --> 47:39.593
I just wanna help!

47:46.370 --> 47:47.820
You saved my life last night.

47:49.340 --> 47:50.363
You were incredible.

47:53.720 --> 47:55.199
Oh,

47:55.200 --> 47:57.463
you looked a lot taller
on top of that car though.

47:58.500 --> 47:59.333
No, I'm really sorry.

47:59.334 --> 48:01.489
I just wanted to say thank you

48:01.490 --> 48:03.719
and just see that you were okay.

48:03.720 --> 48:04.919
My name's Samuel, what's your name?

48:04.920 --> 48:05.800
You need to go.

48:05.801 --> 48:08.139
But I just got here and I wanna help.

48:08.140 --> 48:09.479
They know I'm here.

48:09.480 --> 48:11.053
Then why don't you go?

48:12.160 --> 48:14.573
In here, I'm the only
person they can hurt.

48:16.530 --> 48:17.680
But we're a team now.

48:23.406 --> 48:25.678
You may as well
open the door, Set.

48:25.679 --> 48:27.029
I'm not gonna kick it down.

48:31.440 --> 48:32.999
Fine.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.150
I'll talk to your door.

48:35.830 --> 48:37.259
My name is Marks.

48:37.260 --> 48:39.309
You know me by ranking.

48:39.310 --> 48:41.379
My bid was accepted this morning.

48:41.380 --> 48:44.469
If I didn't hold you in
high regard as a freelancer,

48:44.470 --> 48:46.029
you'd already be dead.

48:46.030 --> 48:46.863
You're one of us,

48:46.864 --> 48:49.079
so I'm extending you a
professional courtesy.

48:49.080 --> 48:50.163
I expect the same.

48:53.890 --> 48:54.929
I'm leaving you an address.

48:54.930 --> 48:56.780
You better be there by noon tomorrow.

48:58.330 --> 49:01.433
Set, you know how bad this gets
if I have to come find you.

49:11.080 --> 49:13.179
I got really nervous.

49:13.180 --> 49:14.183
But you're safe now.

49:15.550 --> 49:18.749
I mean, until noon tomorrow
because professional courtesy.

49:18.750 --> 49:19.583
It's like a duel, right?

49:19.584 --> 49:20.593
You get to fight him?

49:23.850 --> 49:24.683
Great!

49:25.920 --> 49:27.129
I don't mean "great."

49:27.130 --> 49:28.589
I mean, that guys sounds terrifying

49:28.590 --> 49:29.959
and probably like three times your size

49:29.960 --> 49:32.039
but I mean great for me because

49:32.040 --> 49:34.432
maybe you wanna grab food
and/or coffee with me?

49:34.433 --> 49:35.350
I mean, if you're free.

49:35.351 --> 49:37.273
Which, I know you're free.

49:39.470 --> 49:41.509
Wait, is that not cool?

49:41.510 --> 49:43.419
I just figured, you know, on your day off

49:43.420 --> 49:45.464
you might wanna enjoy it a little bit and,

49:46.510 --> 49:48.110
you know, it might be your last.

50:04.992 --> 50:09.075
You don't think that
helicopter's for you, is it?

50:11.770 --> 50:13.613
My sister says you don't have a soul.

50:14.673 --> 50:15.876
I mean, not that you don't have a soul

50:15.877 --> 50:16.969
and not that she's right

50:16.970 --> 50:19.293
but, you know, she's just being a sister.

50:24.240 --> 50:26.179
You don't have to hide
like that, you know.

50:26.180 --> 50:27.439
I mean, I know you know
a lot of bad people

50:27.440 --> 50:29.399
but people here are mostly pretty nice.

50:29.400 --> 50:31.499
They'd wanna help you more than hurt you.

50:31.500 --> 50:33.699
That's what I'm trying to avoid.

50:33.700 --> 50:35.300
Why are you so afraid of help?

50:38.968 --> 50:40.420
Because I don't deserve it.

50:42.840 --> 50:44.323
How many people have you killed?

50:46.860 --> 50:47.693
17.

50:50.290 --> 50:51.379
They were all coming after you, right?

50:51.380 --> 50:52.213
No.

50:55.090 --> 50:56.189
You hungry?

50:56.190 --> 50:57.459
I know this really great spot.

50:57.460 --> 51:00.733
Well, it's kind of a spot but
it's definitely really good.

51:05.290 --> 51:06.803
Come on, you're hungry.

51:13.100 --> 51:14.409
It's a yes!

51:14.410 --> 51:15.243
Come on.

51:35.600 --> 51:37.017
You like Mexican?

51:40.750 --> 51:42.569
Don't worry, they washed their hands.

51:42.570 --> 51:44.493
If they don't, it just adds to the flavor.

51:46.290 --> 51:47.123
See?

51:48.970 --> 51:50.369
Mmmm.

51:50.370 --> 51:51.220
God, that's good.

52:00.044 --> 52:02.961
You know, I saw you at the library.

52:06.140 --> 52:07.909
I have a hard time focusing some times,

52:07.910 --> 52:08.949
so I like to read different pieces

52:08.950 --> 52:10.209
of different books at different times

52:10.210 --> 52:11.479
and find a reason in my head

52:11.480 --> 52:13.133
to make it all apart of the same story.

52:15.180 --> 52:17.939
I think that's how things
are sometimes, you know?

52:17.940 --> 52:20.709
Like, we're each our own
different type of book

52:20.710 --> 52:22.443
but we're all part of the same story.

52:24.900 --> 52:25.913
But only sometimes.

52:34.950 --> 52:35.783
You like it?

52:43.274 --> 52:44.469
Oh my God!

52:44.470 --> 52:46.039
I almost forgot what today is!

52:46.040 --> 52:47.456
Oh, it's already started
but we can still make it.

52:47.457 --> 52:48.839
I have an extra mask in my car

52:48.840 --> 52:50.839
but it's usually for Dana
but she never likes to go,

52:50.840 --> 52:51.793
so now it's yours.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.903
Come on, come on, come on!

52:58.163 --> 52:58.996
Come on!

53:47.481 --> 53:48.314
Come on.

53:54.326 --> 53:55.939
Don't worry, it's just a local thing.

53:55.940 --> 53:57.959
Not a lot of people come to these.

53:57.960 --> 54:00.369
Not a lot of people know about it.

54:00.370 --> 54:01.280
Someone started it one day

54:01.281 --> 54:02.499
and sometimes people bring friends

54:02.500 --> 54:04.400
and no one ever takes their masks off.

54:06.340 --> 54:07.881
It's okay.

54:07.882 --> 54:09.582
Don't be afraid, you're safe here.

54:18.648 --> 54:19.924
There you go.

56:08.424 --> 56:09.573
Did you know it was me?

56:11.093 --> 56:11.926
Come on!

56:22.599 --> 56:24.182
Come on, it's okay.

56:25.831 --> 56:26.664
Come on.

56:34.247 --> 56:36.046
What's wrong?

56:46.954 --> 56:47.871
I smiled.

56:53.467 --> 56:55.300
Thanks for everything.

59:03.207 --> 59:04.857
That's not very sportsman like.

59:10.600 --> 59:11.433
Whatever.

59:26.720 --> 59:29.327
Those toothpicks are gonna
break before my hands do.

01:00:13.812 --> 01:00:15.803
You wanna know how much you were worth?

01:00:21.212 --> 01:00:22.295
Not enough.

01:00:23.567 --> 01:00:24.400
Okay.

01:00:39.834 --> 01:00:40.834
It's okay.

01:00:43.525 --> 01:00:45.409
Just let it go.

01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:46.243
It's over.

01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:52.265
Hey!

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:54.959
Who the fuck are you?

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:10.812
Hey, you okay?

01:01:10.813 --> 01:01:11.993
Are you okay?

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:14.995
Go get his phone.

01:01:14.996 --> 01:01:15.829
Where?

01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:23.084
I got it!

01:01:23.085 --> 01:01:23.918
I got it!

01:01:23.918 --> 01:01:24.751
What now?

01:01:26.663 --> 01:01:29.829
Dial the last number on his phone

01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:31.309
or they'll be here.

01:01:31.310 --> 01:01:32.143
Okay.

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:42.523
Set?

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.709
It's done.

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:47.543
She's dead.

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.016
Congrats, cowboy.

01:01:51.017 --> 01:01:52.771
The transfer's on the way.

01:01:54.948 --> 01:01:57.615
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:02:00.746 --> 01:02:01.579
Dana!

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:04.963
Samuel, what the hell?

01:02:04.964 --> 01:02:07.029
Help me with her.

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:08.709
What happened?

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:10.439
She had to fight.

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:11.273
What did you do?

01:02:11.274 --> 01:02:12.669
Don't worry, I'm fine, okay?

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:14.970
Just get me some more pillows.

01:02:14.971 --> 01:02:16.189
We'll just call the cops.

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:17.499
We'll tell them you
find her in the street.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:18.333
She was mugged.

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:19.349
No, no way!

01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:21.228
The people that did this
to her think she's dead.

01:02:21.229 --> 01:02:24.119
I called them and if
they find out she's alive

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:24.970
then they'll just come after her.

01:02:24.971 --> 01:02:26.469
Sam, stop!

01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:27.792
You can't just harbor
a criminal in our home.

01:02:27.793 --> 01:02:30.602
Especially if she's
bleeding all over the couch.

01:02:30.603 --> 01:02:31.560
I'll get the pillows.

01:02:31.561 --> 01:02:32.889
What're you gonna do if she dies?

01:02:32.890 --> 01:02:34.149
She's not gonna die.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.983
Look at her!

01:02:34.983 --> 01:02:35.816
No!

01:02:35.817 --> 01:02:37.447
She's not gonna die.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.513
Hey.

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:11.060
It's been a whole day.

01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.573
Drink.

01:03:25.674 --> 01:03:27.591
They think you're dead.

01:03:40.729 --> 01:03:41.729
Thank you.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:55.100
So it's done then?

01:04:12.606 --> 01:04:14.356
Are you asleep again?

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:17.223
No.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:20.953
Oh.

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:28.493
So that guy was really trying to kill you.

01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:31.083
Why?

01:04:46.055 --> 01:04:47.638
I made a mistake.

01:06:33.693 --> 01:06:37.217
So they're after you
because the girl's dead.

01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:47.893
They're after me
because she's still alive.

01:07:00.819 --> 01:07:03.069
And as long as we both are,

01:07:05.033 --> 01:07:06.950
they're just gonna keep

01:07:08.354 --> 01:07:09.187
coming.

01:07:28.639 --> 01:07:29.472
I can't.

01:07:32.534 --> 01:07:33.367
Okay.

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.613
Is there a
problem with the transfer?

01:07:53.090 --> 01:07:54.659
Hello.

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:57.613
Do you know whose
phone you have, young lady?

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:02.295
She's not dead.

01:08:02.296 --> 01:08:04.723
The girl you're looking for, she's alive.

01:08:08.069 --> 01:08:09.269
Who is this?

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.259
I want you to get her out of my house.

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:13.739
Get her out.

01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:16.189
But promise you'll leave us out of this.

01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:17.488
Agreed.

01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:19.299
I think it's best for all of us.

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:21.050
You have my word as a professional.

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:25.819
I'll tell you where she is.

01:08:30.301 --> 01:08:33.122
Why don't
you tell me everything?

01:08:33.122 --> 01:08:34.488
From the beginning.

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:35.303
Hey.

01:11:35.304 --> 01:11:37.239
Are you feeling better now?

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.649
Oh, I got your car towed over.

01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:40.019
It's in the parking lot

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:41.329
and I bought food.

01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:43.789
I'm not an awesome cook but
one time I got to help Dana.

01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:44.683
I have to go.

01:11:45.730 --> 01:11:46.959
Wait, what?

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.269
Is something wrong?

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:49.170
Did they find you?

01:11:50.690 --> 01:11:51.759
I've already been here too long.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.049
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:54.459
If you go out there, they'll find you.

01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:56.483
Just wait it out a couple more days.

01:11:58.450 --> 01:11:59.750
I'm running out of time.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.121
Running out of time for what?

01:12:08.122 --> 01:12:09.538
Hey.

01:12:09.539 --> 01:12:11.139
Hey, just wait a second, please!

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:14.519
What do you think this is?

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:15.713
Who do you think I am?

01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:19.543
Why don't you get it?

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.239
I kill people.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.149
Not bad people.

01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:25.349
Just people.

01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:26.549
You're different from everybody.

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:27.433
No I'm not.

01:12:29.462 --> 01:12:31.769
You know what I regret the most?

01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:33.739
I regret not killing that little girl

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:35.779
because if she was dead,

01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.649
my life would still be the same

01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:40.863
and I'd still be doing the
only thing I'm good for.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.409
No.

01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:45.619
No, you're not a bad person.

01:12:45.620 --> 01:12:47.183
You're not like them.

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:50.193
Yes I am.

01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:54.380
Are you listening to me?

01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:00.299
The world is full of terrible people

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:03.739
who don't care about you, your sister

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.199
or your ignorant little lives

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.200
and I'm one of them.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.680
I am a monster.

01:13:17.078 --> 01:13:18.443
I have to go.

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:43.933
Hey.

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:46.683
Where is she?

01:15:49.950 --> 01:15:51.649
Sam, where is she?

01:15:51.650 --> 01:15:53.169
She left.

01:15:53.170 --> 01:15:54.729
She's gone.

01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:55.879
She's gone?

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.780
What do you mean she's gone, for good?

01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:01.093
Oh shit.

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.829
Oh shit.

01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:05.099
I thought you'd be happy.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.963
Samuel, I think I made a mistake.

01:16:07.798 --> 01:16:09.226
Oh my God.

01:16:09.227 --> 01:16:10.929
Are you okay?

01:16:10.930 --> 01:16:11.763
I messed up.

01:16:12.766 --> 01:16:15.329
I told them she was at our house.

01:16:15.330 --> 01:16:16.766
I told them where our house is!

01:16:16.767 --> 01:16:17.859
You called them?

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:18.979
Why would you do that?

01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:20.279
I don't know, I don't
know, I don't know!

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:21.120
Because she's a killer!

01:16:21.121 --> 01:16:23.720
Because we can't keep her
around like a fucking pet!

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.069
Oh my God.

01:16:27.070 --> 01:16:29.559
If they come and she's gone.

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.749
I have to find her.

01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:31.779
No, you can't go.

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.613
They're coming.

01:16:32.614 --> 01:16:33.769
No, it's not right!

01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:36.279
She made mistakes but I have
to try and at least warn her.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:37.883
But you can't go, Sam!

01:16:40.890 --> 01:16:42.113
You sold her out.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:44.237
I didn't.

01:16:45.861 --> 01:16:47.028
Yes you did.

01:16:49.974 --> 01:16:51.224
No, I didn't.

01:16:53.486 --> 01:16:54.653
Sam, I didn't.

01:16:57.011 --> 01:16:58.761
Oh my God, oh my God.

01:16:59.629 --> 01:17:00.462
Oh my God.

01:17:04.226 --> 01:17:05.553
Fuck!

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:07.221
Are you kidding me?!

01:17:08.377 --> 01:17:09.210
God!

01:17:14.116 --> 01:17:14.949
Oh my God.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:17.717
It's okay.

01:17:17.718 --> 01:17:18.551
It's fine.

01:17:22.588 --> 01:17:23.421
It's fine.

01:17:29.459 --> 01:17:30.292
Samuel.

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:49.680
I'm just gonna call and it'll fix it.

01:17:49.681 --> 01:17:50.764
It'll fix it.

01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:03.803
She's not here.

01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:08.819
I'm the one who called before.

01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:10.239
The girl, she's gone.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.073
She left.

01:18:20.717 --> 01:18:22.550
Say something, please!

01:18:26.528 --> 01:18:28.264
This number won't work anymore.

01:18:28.265 --> 01:18:29.223
No, no, no, please!

01:18:29.224 --> 01:18:31.814
I messed up, I did, I'm sorry!

01:18:31.815 --> 01:18:33.934
I'm sorry, no.

01:18:38.495 --> 01:18:40.895
Oh my God, I don't know what I did.

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:23.153
This doesn't mean a whole lot to me.

01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:29.610
What you and I are doing here, it doesn't.

01:19:30.473 --> 01:19:33.273
I could stop your heart in two hits.

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:39.107
This isn't about stopping
your heart, Samuel.

01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:42.750
It's about starting hers.

01:19:44.677 --> 01:19:48.177
Everyone seems to have underestimated her.

01:19:53.349 --> 01:19:56.565
I want to inspire her.

01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:59.750
She's a hero on a journey

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:05.313
and every hero needs a dragon.

01:20:07.090 --> 01:20:08.283
I want her

01:20:09.361 --> 01:20:11.261
to come find me.

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.027
She's not like you.

01:20:15.670 --> 01:20:17.670
Oh, we'll see, Samuel.

01:21:53.361 --> 01:21:54.194
Dana.

01:22:08.275 --> 01:22:09.869
When is Ghetty getting here?

01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:11.520
Should be here within the hour.

01:22:13.907 --> 01:22:16.507
He shoulda been here
yesterday when I ordered him.

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:22.360
Do we know what he was doing in Phoenix?

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:26.199
I received a correspondence
from him earlier.

01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:28.739
Essentially, it was his ETA and a warning

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:30.483
to keep our phone close.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.973
His words were poetic.

01:22:38.050 --> 01:22:39.536
Fucking artists.

01:23:08.930 --> 01:23:09.930
Get away from him.

01:23:27.532 --> 01:23:29.591
Get out of my house.

01:23:30.559 --> 01:23:31.775
Now.

01:23:37.685 --> 01:23:38.518
Now.

01:23:48.719 --> 01:23:49.719
I'm sorry.

01:24:44.197 --> 01:24:45.030
Set?

01:24:54.606 --> 01:24:55.889
Hey, girl.

01:25:14.252 --> 01:25:16.302
Do you remember the first job I gave you?

01:25:26.397 --> 01:25:27.509
Hired you to kill that guy

01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:29.260
that was selling you all that shit.

01:25:34.367 --> 01:25:36.284
Goddamn, you were thin.

01:25:40.037 --> 01:25:41.287
A little stick.

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:49.210
I asked you,

01:25:50.982 --> 01:25:51.815
"Are you ready?

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:56.247
"You sure you're ready?"

01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:05.153
Do you remember you answer?

01:26:08.989 --> 01:26:13.049
"I'm set," you said.

01:26:13.050 --> 01:26:15.442
"I'm all set."

01:26:20.727 --> 01:26:24.453
You know, this ends much
easier if you come see me now.

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:31.910
Regardless of what happens,

01:26:35.263 --> 01:26:37.363
no matter how this turns up,

01:26:42.104 --> 01:26:45.705
I don't regret one single bit of it.

01:26:54.403 --> 01:26:56.320
I'm proud of you, girl.

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.870
I'm gonna fix this.

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.100
She's going to the hospital.

01:27:29.930 --> 01:27:31.033
How do you know?

01:27:32.155 --> 01:27:32.988
Because,

01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:36.230
she's trying to eliminate witnesses.

01:27:39.843 --> 01:27:40.750
There's no telling what happened

01:27:40.751 --> 01:27:44.443
to the civilians in Arizona
when Ghetty was down there.

01:27:46.778 --> 01:27:48.445
But if they're gone,

01:27:50.527 --> 01:27:53.953
then that girl in ICU is
her last piece to clean up.

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:57.733
Sir, are we letting her?

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.273
No.

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:13.827
We have to set precedent.

01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:17.543
Call Ghetty.

01:28:18.490 --> 01:28:20.240
Clear out the entire hospital wing.

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:26.083
Bring shooters.

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:30.920
Bloodbath or not, I can't
take chances on this.

01:28:34.740 --> 01:28:36.840
She doesn't leave, no matter what happens.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:43.083
For her and that girl,

01:28:46.690 --> 01:28:47.590
it's over tonight.

01:28:59.318 --> 01:29:01.318
Welcome home, Set-y.

01:29:15.501 --> 01:29:16.884
She didn't mean to.

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:43.629
What's up, bitches?

01:29:43.630 --> 01:29:44.463
Lunch is here.

01:29:46.992 --> 01:29:48.042
This is a hospital.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:50.340
Get out the chair.

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.563
Let's see what the doctor ordered today.

01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:04.313
Babysitters.

01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:20.293
Really?

01:30:23.290 --> 01:30:24.123
Little much, huh?

01:30:29.673 --> 01:30:31.536
No rookies, please.

01:30:43.258 --> 01:30:45.454
I need some privacy.

01:31:45.350 --> 01:31:47.026
Oh no, I'll wait.

01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:05.070
Samuel was very brave.

01:32:08.616 --> 01:32:09.783
Truth is, Set,

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:14.710
we all make mistakes before we
hit that first hundred mark.

01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:20.279
You can come back from this.

01:32:31.020 --> 01:32:33.603
I am your muse.

01:32:34.992 --> 01:32:36.868
Now show me something

01:32:36.892 --> 01:32:40.441
you've never done to survive.

01:34:27.759 --> 01:34:31.542
I am so sorry.

01:34:33.442 --> 01:34:36.292
I am so, so sorry.

01:34:50.548 --> 01:34:52.732
I did this.

01:34:55.941 --> 01:34:57.524
You did this to me.

01:34:58.552 --> 01:35:00.927
I did that to you.

01:35:10.713 --> 01:35:13.013
I don't remember my mom.

01:35:15.486 --> 01:35:17.283
I can't remember her face at all.

01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:19.223
I don't,

01:35:20.250 --> 01:35:23.749
I don't have memories of my family.

01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:25.293
Never even had a first kiss.

01:35:31.877 --> 01:35:33.683
Everything that I've learned,

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:37.549
every person that I've killed,

01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:40.932
I've never lost control and then you,

01:35:40.933 --> 01:35:42.196
and then you,

01:35:42.197 --> 01:35:43.633
and I'm sorry for that.

01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:51.363
I took everything from you.

01:35:54.154 --> 01:35:55.487
I took your mom.

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:57.917
I took your dad.

01:36:00.420 --> 01:36:02.518
I took your smile.

01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.123
I'm a monster

01:36:12.515 --> 01:36:13.653
and I'm sorry.

01:36:16.545 --> 01:36:19.809
I've spent every hour

01:36:19.810 --> 01:36:22.069
of the last four days fighting for my life

01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:23.279
with everything that I have

01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:25.453
because I couldn't let them take it.

01:36:27.366 --> 01:36:29.489
I couldn't let them take it.

01:36:29.490 --> 01:36:32.097
My life is the only thing
that I have to offer you.

01:36:50.781 --> 01:36:53.210
You're the only person

01:36:53.211 --> 01:36:56.628
that has the right to make this decision.

01:36:58.644 --> 01:37:00.644
And everything you're feeling right now,

01:37:01.889 --> 01:37:02.722
it's okay.

01:37:04.832 --> 01:37:05.999
All the anger,

01:37:09.572 --> 01:37:10.405
it's okay.

01:37:17.812 --> 01:37:18.645
It's okay.

01:37:22.687 --> 01:37:24.981
It's your decision to make alone.

01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:31.289
No, focus on me.

01:37:31.290 --> 01:37:32.123
Focus.

01:37:33.841 --> 01:37:38.745
This decision is the only
thing that matters right now.

01:37:38.746 --> 01:37:40.413
It's the only thing.

01:37:47.063 --> 01:37:48.646
It's your decision.
