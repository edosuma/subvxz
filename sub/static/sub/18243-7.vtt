some galafrasian cocoa--

If I added a pinch of
torian honey,

01:04.150 --> 01:06.414
could I stretch the magic
into third period?

in the recipe,

makes sense.

but Kelly's in
way over her head already.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.697
I don't want her to know.

22:36.180 --> 22:37.225
Kelly:
I'm in over my head?

22:37.312 --> 22:38.618
I can't believe
my grandma.

22:38.705 --> 22:39.880
We unfroze the town.

22:39.967 --> 22:41.882
We also froze it.

22:41.969 --> 22:43.187
Just sayin'.

22:43.274 --> 22:46.321
18, 17, 16,
almost there.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.715
Kelly:
They're clearly planning on
doing something to Chuck.

22:48.802 --> 22:53.894
- 10, 9--
- We all saw how well
that turned out in 1965.

22:53.981 --> 22:56.549
Let's just focus on
one problem at a time.

22:56.636 --> 22:59.900
Three, two, one, zero.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.902
[birds chirping]

23:03.382 --> 23:06.515
Kelly,
we can see you.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.952
And a dirty old trailer.

23:09.039 --> 23:09.953
Darbie: Whoa.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.570
I think we just found
where Chuck's been hiding.

23:17.657 --> 23:20.007
How did he
make this invisible?

23:20.094 --> 23:23.227
No clue, but it means
he knows how to do magic.

23:23.314 --> 23:25.404
Big magic.

23:25.491 --> 23:26.405
Let's go look.

23:31.453 --> 23:32.411
Looks empty.

23:33.890 --> 23:34.848
Let's go in.

23:34.935 --> 23:37.416
- Really?
- Really.

23:44.945 --> 23:48.078
- Huh.
- Ugh, how old is
this place?

23:48.165 --> 23:51.125
Well, this comic
is from 1965.

23:51.212 --> 23:53.040
I wonder if it's
worth anything.

23:53.127 --> 23:55.346
It's such a mess in here.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.392
Yeah. If I had an
invisible club house,

23:57.479 --> 23:59.350
I wouldn't
clean it either.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.179
Uh, guys.
Check this out.

24:04.747 --> 24:06.227
Darbie: It has
the same logo as ours.

24:11.188 --> 24:13.190
Lemon-Lie Mints?

24:14.975 --> 24:16.585
Another magic cookbook?

24:20.371 --> 24:23.810
Chicken-N-Fixits.
We cooked that on
Wednesday.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.551
Make-It-Visible
Vinegar Pie.

24:25.638 --> 24:27.901
We made that today.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.642
Chuck has our recipes.
