00:01.426 --> 00:02.600
Hey, guys. Bizaardvark here.

00:02.636 --> 00:04.862
Who loves lemonade?

00:04.897 --> 00:06.296
Paige, everybody loves lemonade.

00:06.331 --> 00:07.331
- I don't.
- Really?

00:09.109 --> 00:10.120
Like, your whole life
you hated lemonade?

00:10.144 --> 00:11.718
Yes, it's too sour.

00:11.753 --> 00:13.169

00:13.204 --> 00:15.447
filming a video called
<i>Lemonade Stand.</i>

- Dad!

03:17.656 --> 03:19.998
You're home even earlier
than I thought.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.445
Well, surgeries end a lot quicker
when things go horribly wrong.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.143
What?

03:24.179 --> 03:25.946
I'm kidding. They rescheduled.
Come here.

03:28.650 --> 03:32.127
Now, who's ready
for the latest edition of...

03:32.162 --> 03:33.136
"What's the Grossest Thing
I Saw Today"?

03:33.171 --> 03:35.255
Ooh, me, me, me, me!

03:35.332 --> 03:37.457
What do you get when you
cross the small intestine

03:37.493 --> 03:39.918
with 80 years
of eating fast food?

03:42.172 --> 03:45.348
Oh, I can't even look at it!

03:45.383 --> 03:47.000
Can you text me that?

03:47.035 --> 03:48.093
I want it as my wallpaper.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.723
Hey, what smells so good?

03:52.758 --> 03:54.766
I cooked for us.

03:54.801 --> 03:55.995
It's been like a month since
you've been home early enough

03:56.019 --> 03:57.326
to have dinner together,

03:57.362 --> 03:58.740
so I wanted to
make tonight special.

03:58.764 --> 04:00.513
This is great.

04:00.549 --> 04:03.091
Dinner with my
favorite person in the world,

04:03.126 --> 04:04.804
and I don't have to think
about intestines and blood.

04:04.828 --> 04:05.944
So, what'd you cook?

04:07.572 --> 04:09.055
Spaghetti and red sauce.

04:09.091 --> 04:10.091
(exclaims)

04:12.444 --> 04:16.062
Hey, didn't you and Paige post
a new Bizaardvark video today?

04:16.097 --> 04:18.456
- Yeah.
- Let's watch it now.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.532
<i>♪ Oh. Oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

04:19.567 --> 04:20.567
<i>(message beeps)</i>

04:23.663 --> 04:25.303
It's okay. I'm sure
it's not an emergency.

04:27.192 --> 04:28.192
It's an emergency.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.486
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

04:31.522 --> 04:33.115
You know there's nowhere
else that I'd rather be

04:33.139 --> 04:34.756
than here having
dinner with you.

04:34.791 --> 04:36.057
I know. I understand.

04:38.403 --> 04:40.778
Oh, nobody knows I went home,

04:40.814 --> 04:43.174
so I better make it look like
I was working this whole time.

04:43.716 --> 04:44.716
Perfect.

04:51.841 --> 04:54.534
And so, Grandma said to me,

04:54.569 --> 04:56.711
"Bernie, don't worry.
Your gerbil's just sleeping...

04:56.746 --> 04:59.114
for a really long time."

04:59.149 --> 05:01.349
I'm sick of hot chocolate.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.625
Okay. Well, forget my story.

05:05.088 --> 05:07.038
Every day it's the same thing.

05:07.073 --> 05:09.098
It's hot, it's chocolate.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.117
It's boring.

05:11.152 --> 05:13.937
Servants of Vuuugle
hush thy mouths!

05:13.972 --> 05:16.164
Dirk speaks the truth.

05:16.199 --> 05:18.475
Hot chocolate... is boring.

05:21.204 --> 05:23.555
Well, thanks,
Live-like-a-Viking-Channel guy.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.831
Your vision is inspiring.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.909
Everyone here looks up to you.

05:27.944 --> 05:29.828
You're like our leader,

05:29.863 --> 05:31.488
Dirk of House Me Bro.

05:33.483 --> 05:34.483
I'm a leader.

05:36.261 --> 05:39.020
We shouldn't just accept
a Hot Chocolate Bar.

05:39.055 --> 05:41.881
We deserve something better!

05:41.916 --> 05:43.358
All (shouting): Yeah!

05:43.393 --> 05:45.543
And we should replace
the Hot Chocolate Bar

05:45.579 --> 05:46.790
with something
that makes us say,

05:46.814 --> 05:49.039
"This is better!"

05:49.074 --> 05:50.390
All (shouting): Yeah!

05:50.425 --> 05:51.991
And Dirk lives with me,

05:52.026 --> 05:53.968
so that makes me co-leader!

05:54.004 --> 05:55.244
(shouts enthusiastically) Yeah!

05:56.898 --> 05:57.898
No? Okay.

06:00.602 --> 06:02.271
Hey, are you guys talking
about the Hot Chocolate Bar?

06:02.295 --> 06:04.011
'Cause I've been thinking,

06:04.047 --> 06:06.372
and I actually have
a plan to improve it.

06:06.408 --> 06:09.217
Instead of just hot chocolate,

06:09.252 --> 06:11.736
we could enjoy
a variety of beverages.

06:11.771 --> 06:14.322
All we have to do is add more
hoses and rewire the bar.

06:14.358 --> 06:17.484
Whoa. Hoses and wires?

06:17.519 --> 06:18.519
Sounds kinda complicated.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.497
It's really not.

06:22.532 --> 06:25.550
Imagine any drink you can
think of at any time.

06:25.585 --> 06:28.044
Now we have to imagine things?

06:30.657 --> 06:33.766
Dirk's plan
is based in reality...

06:33.802 --> 06:36.519
Replace the Hot Chocolate Bar
with something that is better!

06:36.555 --> 06:39.097
All: Yeah!

06:39.132 --> 06:41.599
And as co-leader, Dirk demands
that you say "yeah" to me!

06:43.996 --> 06:44.902
Just do it, guys.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.729
All: Yeah.

06:48.383 --> 06:49.383
Yeah.

06:55.131 --> 06:57.182
Monday's gonna be brutal.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.876
How can we have both
a test and a term paper due?

06:59.911 --> 07:01.377
That should be illegal.

07:01.412 --> 07:02.579
It's like I always said,

07:02.614 --> 07:04.339
Homework Cops.

07:04.374 --> 07:05.974
Could be a movie?
Should be a real thing.

07:09.237 --> 07:10.145
Hey, what's up?

07:10.180 --> 07:12.538
I'm sorry.

07:12.573 --> 07:15.216
It's just... my dad had to miss
dinner again because of work.

07:15.252 --> 07:17.377
I never get to
hang out with him.

07:17.412 --> 07:19.465
It feels like his patients get
to see him more than I do.

07:19.489 --> 07:20.825
Well, to be fair,
they're paying him,

07:20.849 --> 07:22.015
like, a lot.

07:25.428 --> 07:27.828
Maybe you just need to find
another way to get his attention.

07:28.931 --> 07:31.290
Dr. Wong, you have
an emergency patient.

07:31.326 --> 07:32.486
She doesn't have much time...

07:34.429 --> 07:35.487
with her father.

07:37.465 --> 07:38.231
Did I do the dramatic
pause right?

07:38.266 --> 07:39.599
Yeah.

07:39.634 --> 07:40.634
(in sing-song) Nailed it.

07:41.845 --> 07:43.119
Hi, Dad.

07:43.155 --> 07:45.213
Frankie, what's going on?

07:45.248 --> 07:47.273
You're always working.

07:47.308 --> 07:48.502
This is the only way
I knew I could see you.

07:48.526 --> 07:50.092
Really?

07:50.128 --> 07:52.570
And you thought sneaking into
the hospital was a good idea?

07:52.605 --> 07:53.796
Yeah, well, think about it.

07:53.831 --> 07:56.031
Shouldn't your doctor be
more than just a doctor to you?

07:58.895 --> 08:01.135
You're reading that off the
poster behind me, aren't you?

08:02.424 --> 08:04.916
Sorry, Dad. It's just that...

08:04.952 --> 08:07.912
three out of five women over the age
of 60 suffer from high blood pressure.

08:09.347 --> 08:11.347
Oh, speaking of,

08:11.383 --> 08:12.710
you wanna see a picture
of a clogged artery?

08:12.734 --> 08:14.275
Like, really clogged?

08:15.903 --> 08:17.453
(exclaims loudly Oh!

08:17.489 --> 08:19.113
Ugh!

08:19.149 --> 08:20.389
Can that be our Christmas card?

08:25.547 --> 08:28.572
<i>So, you want to destroy
the Hot Chocolate bar</i>

08:28.608 --> 08:31.009
<i>and replace it
with something... better?</i>

08:31.044 --> 08:32.543
All (shouting): Yeah!

08:32.578 --> 08:34.963
<i>Well, there is
an old Vuuugle rule</i>

08:34.998 --> 08:36.525
<i>that if a majority agrees on
an issue of building policy,</i>

08:36.549 --> 08:37.790
<i>they can change it.</i>

08:37.825 --> 08:39.250
Really?

08:39.285 --> 08:40.285
<i>No. I just don't care.</i>

08:42.046 --> 08:45.314
<i>Also, you have an angry mob
and I have no arms.</i>

08:45.349 --> 08:47.258
All (shouting): Yeah!

08:47.293 --> 08:49.336
Hang on, everyone.

08:49.371 --> 08:52.196
I realized not all of you
responded to my plan earlier.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.282
Who is this dragon lady?

08:54.317 --> 08:56.401
And why does she keep appearing?

08:58.272 --> 08:59.612
We get it, Scott,
you're a viking.

09:02.867 --> 09:05.310
I had my architect
draw up a blue print

09:05.345 --> 09:06.665
so you could see
my plan on paper.

09:11.493 --> 09:14.227
If it's not written on goat
skin with the blood of a fox,

09:14.262 --> 09:15.937
I will not read it!

09:15.972 --> 09:17.096
March on!

09:17.132 --> 09:18.598
All: Yeah!

09:18.633 --> 09:20.208
Wait, wait, wait, guys,

09:20.243 --> 09:23.036
what're we doing?

09:23.071 --> 09:24.748
We can't just destroy
the Hot Chocolate Bar...

09:24.772 --> 09:26.722
Thank you.

09:26.757 --> 09:28.925
Without filming it
for our channels!

09:28.960 --> 09:30.401
What?

09:30.436 --> 09:31.436
All (shouting): Yeah!

09:35.851 --> 09:37.358
(dubstep music playing)

09:40.872 --> 09:41.872
(shouting)

09:50.982 --> 09:52.273
Yeah!

09:52.309 --> 09:54.626
(chainsaw buzzing)

09:58.848 --> 10:01.382
(yelling)

10:03.261 --> 10:04.585
(heroic music playing)

10:04.620 --> 10:06.262
Yeah!

10:16.824 --> 10:18.600
(cheering)

10:18.635 --> 10:23.012
(dubstep music continues)

10:23.048 --> 10:24.714
Whoop, whoop, whoop!

10:24.749 --> 10:27.391
<i>So, Dirk,</i>

10:27.427 --> 10:29.747
<i>what do you plan on replacing
the Hot Chocolate Bar with?</i>

10:30.489 --> 10:32.622
<i>You do have a plan, right?</i>

10:37.287 --> 10:38.911
Of course I do.

10:38.946 --> 10:39.946
It's...

10:42.075 --> 10:43.591
(shouts) better!

10:45.603 --> 10:47.095
(cheering)

10:49.040 --> 10:52.067
(laughs)

10:52.069 --> 10:55.628
Hey, man, I really feel
like we bonded back there.

10:55.664 --> 10:57.557
You wanna come over sometime and
have soup with me and my grandma?

10:57.581 --> 10:59.816
Your story saddens my ears.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.120
How can I have both a history test
and a term paper due on Monday?

11:10.144 --> 11:12.153
Relax.

11:12.189 --> 11:14.288
It's Saturday. You've got
the whole weekend to study.

11:14.323 --> 11:16.115
Oh, hey. How about we
take a study break?

11:16.151 --> 11:17.911
I just finished editing
our piggy bank video.

11:18.954 --> 11:20.569
<i>♪ Well, I keep your money ♪</i>

11:20.604 --> 11:22.788
<i>♪ Until you are ready ♪</i>

11:22.824 --> 11:24.306
<i>♪So you can buy a bike or a... ♪</i>

11:24.342 --> 11:26.584
(screaming)

11:26.619 --> 11:29.404
<i>Why would you do that?</i>

11:29.439 --> 11:33.132
<i>All I ever did was help you and
teach you how to be responsible.</i>

11:33.167 --> 11:35.251
<i>Ugh. My entire life...</i>

11:35.287 --> 11:36.287
<i>was for nothing.</i>

11:39.081 --> 11:40.150
Thanks, Paige.
That really helped.

11:40.174 --> 11:41.357
(cell phone dings)

11:41.393 --> 11:43.151
Oh, uh, I gotta get home.

11:43.186 --> 11:44.186
You got this.

11:50.268 --> 11:51.628
Bye, Dad. Have a
great day at work.

11:51.661 --> 11:52.985
I'm not going to work today.

11:53.020 --> 11:54.504
What do you mean?

11:54.539 --> 11:56.099
After your little stunt
at the hospital,

11:56.123 --> 11:58.557
I realized you're right.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.568
We don't spend
enough time together.

12:00.603 --> 12:02.978
So I'm taking
the next two weeks off.

12:03.014 --> 12:06.725
What? Really? That's amazing!

12:06.801 --> 12:07.616
Oh, wait, you still gonna
get paid money, right?

12:07.652 --> 12:08.652
Heck yeah.

12:10.137 --> 12:11.679
And the fun starts now.

12:11.715 --> 12:13.923
I got passes to the water park!

12:13.958 --> 12:16.333
Splash-o-rama for today?

12:16.369 --> 12:18.355
Yep, unless you have more school
work you need to do for Monday.

12:18.379 --> 12:19.379
Uh...

12:20.881 --> 12:21.881
Nope.

12:23.651 --> 12:26.361
No way! Are these
"skip the line" passes?

12:26.396 --> 12:28.565
I can't wait to make fun of the people
who don't get to skip the line.

12:28.589 --> 12:30.323
Yeah, have fun
staying dry, suckas!

12:35.697 --> 12:36.697
- Bathing suit?
- Yep.

12:41.828 --> 12:44.086
Woo!

12:44.121 --> 12:45.979
I still don't know
the rules of paintball,

12:46.015 --> 12:47.415
but I've got every color on me.

12:47.450 --> 12:48.966
So I'm pretty sure I won.

12:50.453 --> 12:52.136
Today was awesome.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.739
I can't remember the last
time I had this much fun.

12:54.774 --> 12:59.068
Yeah, probably because you spend your
days doing surgery on people's heads.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.337
You know that I'm the Head
Surgeon at the hospital,

13:01.372 --> 13:03.214
not a head surgeon, right?

13:03.249 --> 13:04.816
Yeah, we needed this
catch-up time.

13:15.302 --> 13:17.269
Up for a softball catch?

13:17.304 --> 13:18.830
Aw, like when I was little.

13:18.865 --> 13:19.865
Yep.

13:22.118 --> 13:23.960
Um, I just...
I need my lucky hat.

13:28.174 --> 13:32.385
Okay. England, France, war.
Got it.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.049
Can't go on a hike
without sunscreen.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.228
Um, term paper.

13:43.765 --> 13:47.132
By Frankie Wong.

13:47.168 --> 13:48.168
Okay, good start.

13:50.212 --> 13:51.354
Dr. Wong: Hurry up, Frankie.

13:51.389 --> 13:53.097
Planetarium closes at 7:00.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.558
Uh, I'm just flipping pages.

13:55.593 --> 13:56.673
I'm retaining none of this!

14:02.166 --> 14:06.344
Dirk, all these people
are excited to hear your plan.

14:06.379 --> 14:08.354
Bern-man, I gotta
be honest with you,

14:08.389 --> 14:11.649
I do not have a plan.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.164
Well, that is certainly going to
affect their excitement level.

14:14.763 --> 14:16.421
But it's cool.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.624
I was up all night
thinking about it,

14:17.648 --> 14:20.099
and I'm prepared to handle any
question that they throw at me.

14:21.845 --> 14:24.612
(clears throat) As you all know,

14:24.647 --> 14:26.897
I have a fantastic plan

14:26.933 --> 14:29.067
to replace
the Hot Chocolate Bar.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.776
So, what is it?

14:32.956 --> 14:34.956
Shoot. I did not think
they were going to ask that.

14:37.660 --> 14:39.810
Can I have your
attention, everyone.

14:39.845 --> 14:43.138
I've made this
as simple as I can.

14:43.174 --> 14:46.367
This is a model of my plan
for a beverage bar,

14:46.403 --> 14:50.354
with little toys so that
even a child could understand.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.001
See, right here by the bar is where
the new drink machine would...

14:52.025 --> 14:53.591
Why is it so small?

14:55.378 --> 14:56.378
How will we fit in there?

14:58.548 --> 14:59.563
It's a model.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.540
I don't see any models.

15:01.576 --> 15:03.100
Just small animals.

15:06.856 --> 15:07.936
Dirk, may I speak with you?

15:12.962 --> 15:14.478
It's pretty obvious
what's going on.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.672
You have no plan.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.834
These people all say I do.

15:19.869 --> 15:22.578
Isn't that better
than having a plan?

15:22.613 --> 15:25.230
No, it's worse.

15:25.266 --> 15:27.099
They all trust you.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.593
And eventually, they'll
realize you're a fraud.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.037
When they do,

15:32.073 --> 15:33.592
you'll go from being the
most loved person at Vuuugle

15:33.616 --> 15:34.616
to the most hated.

15:36.511 --> 15:38.202
You're right.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.146
I need to fix this.

15:40.181 --> 15:41.430
I can't just let everyone down.

15:41.465 --> 15:43.824
Dirk!

15:43.860 --> 15:47.744
Quit talking to this
bejeweled sorceress.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.339
The men are getting restless.

15:50.374 --> 15:52.214
Give it up, Scott.
You work in a grocery store.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.740
<i>♪ Hey, hey! ♪</i>

16:02.545 --> 16:04.579
Hey, I just finished editing
Piggy Bank's Revenge.

16:04.614 --> 16:06.255
Check it out.

16:06.290 --> 16:08.007
<i>Okay, she'll be here any minute.</i>

16:08.042 --> 16:09.374
<i>(laughs maniacally)</i>

16:09.410 --> 16:11.226
<i>Patience, Mr. Banks.</i>

16:11.262 --> 16:12.342
<i>You will get your revenge.</i>

16:17.385 --> 16:19.844
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

16:19.879 --> 16:21.970
<i>Wait, she's not
filled with coins?</i>

16:22.006 --> 16:24.815
<i>Oh, no. What have I done?</i>

16:24.851 --> 16:26.503
<i>Police Officer: Come out.
We know you're in there.</i>

16:26.527 --> 16:29.695
<i>You'll never take me alive!</i>

16:29.730 --> 16:30.730
<i>(screams, shatters)</i>

16:33.526 --> 16:35.651
So, I'm thinking for part three,

16:35.686 --> 16:38.270
Mr. Banks goes back
in time and meets...

16:38.306 --> 16:41.548
Himself as a baby piggy
bank, obviously.

16:41.584 --> 16:42.324
Can we talk
about this later, please?

16:42.359 --> 16:45.753
I haven't studied at all,
and I only have 45 minutes

16:45.788 --> 16:47.321
before I jump off a building.

16:47.356 --> 16:50.524
Frankie, whoa,
it's just History.

16:50.559 --> 16:52.209
France, England, war.
You got this.

16:54.756 --> 16:56.947
No. My dad and I are literally
jumping off a building.

16:56.982 --> 16:59.100
He got us tickets
to LA Freefall.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.585
(gasps) You mean, downtown's
most extreme adventure

17:01.620 --> 17:04.060
where you bungee jump off the
city's tallest building under...

17:05.099 --> 17:06.073
"The cloak of night."

17:06.108 --> 17:07.266
Ah, I was so close.

17:08.703 --> 17:09.384
What am I gonna do?

17:09.420 --> 17:12.954
I have a term paper that I
have no idea how to write,

17:12.990 --> 17:14.990
a test on this in 12 hours,

17:15.025 --> 17:15.750
and I haven't read any of it.

17:15.785 --> 17:16.785
Any of it!

17:18.062 --> 17:19.845
Hey.

17:19.881 --> 17:21.889
Frankie.

17:21.925 --> 17:22.925
It's gonna be okay.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.960
You're going non-stop.

17:25.995 --> 17:28.053
Why don't you talk to your dad

17:28.089 --> 17:29.599
and see if you can LA
Freefall another time?

17:29.623 --> 17:31.732
There is no other time.

17:31.767 --> 17:32.786
He's going back to work soon.

17:32.810 --> 17:34.644
I know.

17:34.679 --> 17:35.679
And he'll understand.

17:36.972 --> 17:37.972
Talk to him.

17:39.550 --> 17:41.300
Yeah, you're right.
I'll talk to him.

17:41.336 --> 17:42.977
Hey, guys, check it out.

17:43.012 --> 17:44.795
I grabbed him from the hospital.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.174
Let's throw him off the
roof before we jump

17:46.198 --> 17:48.118
and watch all the people
on the ground freak out.

17:49.794 --> 17:51.235
(whispers) Talk to him.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.790
- Goodnight, Dr. Wong.
- 'Night, Paige.

17:57.994 --> 17:59.346
Dad, can I talk
to you for a second?

17:59.370 --> 18:01.237
Of course.

18:01.272 --> 18:02.804
What's going on?

18:02.840 --> 18:03.840
(sighs)

18:07.670 --> 18:09.920
- Look, the past few days...
- Have been incredible.

18:09.955 --> 18:13.040
I know! I'm having so much fun!

18:13.075 --> 18:15.117
But the best part
is when I look over at you

18:15.152 --> 18:16.592
and I see how much fun
you're having.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.522
Reminds me how lucky
I am to be your dad.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.175
(softly) I don't know.
I don't know.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.438
I feel the same way.

18:27.473 --> 18:28.953
- Let's go jump off a building.
- Yes!

18:35.081 --> 18:36.997
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.983
The thing is buckled,
the harness is harnessed,

18:39.018 --> 18:41.668
three, two, one, we jump,
then we go home, right?

18:41.704 --> 18:43.379
I know. I'm excited, too!

18:43.414 --> 18:44.605
Let's do this twice!

18:44.640 --> 18:45.640
Twice?

18:48.411 --> 18:50.080
Man (on loudspeaker): <i>Okay,
next jumpers, you're up.</i>

18:50.104 --> 18:51.203
- That's us.
- Finally.

18:52.990 --> 18:53.990
<i>Goggles on.</i>

18:56.878 --> 19:00.830
<i>Get ready to touch the sky
in three, two...</i>

19:00.865 --> 19:03.657
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.</i>

19:03.693 --> 19:05.136
<i>Looks like we got some
mechanical issues up in here.</i>

19:05.160 --> 19:06.201
Really?

19:06.237 --> 19:08.996
<i>Really.</i>

19:09.031 --> 19:11.048
<i>Don't worry, we'll have
this fixed in no time.</i>

19:11.083 --> 19:13.025
<i>Two... three hours tops.</i>

19:13.060 --> 19:15.161
Ugh, I can't do this!

19:15.196 --> 19:16.812
Frankie, what's wrong?

19:16.848 --> 19:18.147
Everything. Everything's wrong.

19:24.488 --> 19:25.688
Honey, take a breath.

19:25.723 --> 19:27.781
What's going on?

19:27.816 --> 19:31.159
I have a huge test and a
term paper due tomorrow,

19:31.195 --> 19:32.339
and I haven't
worked on any of it

19:32.363 --> 19:35.881
because we've been running
around doing so much stuff.

19:35.916 --> 19:38.325
What? Why didn't you tell me?

19:38.361 --> 19:39.996
Because I only have you
for, like, two weeks,

19:40.020 --> 19:41.495
and then you're going
back to work,

19:41.530 --> 19:43.021
and then I'm going
to lose you again.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.782
Frankie, you're never
gonna lose me.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.269
I ruined everything.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.671
(sobs) I should've said something.
I'm so sorry.

19:50.706 --> 19:53.982
No. This is my fault.

19:54.017 --> 19:55.059
I haven't been around.

19:57.004 --> 19:59.604
(sighs) After your mom
and I got divorced,

19:59.640 --> 20:00.756
I threw myself into work

20:00.791 --> 20:04.159
to make sure that you have
everything that you wanted.

20:04.194 --> 20:05.478
You've done great, Dad.

20:05.513 --> 20:06.987
I know it hasn't been easy.

20:07.023 --> 20:08.023
But I missed everything.

20:10.493 --> 20:15.588
You're the most beautiful, funny,
creative girl in the world

20:15.623 --> 20:16.703
and I never get to see you.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.043
You're my life, Frankie.

20:24.549 --> 20:25.549
From now on,

20:26.909 --> 20:27.824
I'm gonna be around more.

20:27.860 --> 20:28.860
Really?

20:29.995 --> 20:30.995
Really.

20:35.593 --> 20:38.602
Hey.

20:38.637 --> 20:40.877
You wanna see a really gross
picture of a burst appendix?

20:41.824 --> 20:42.824
I love you, too, Dad.

20:48.630 --> 20:50.914
It might take us all night,

20:50.950 --> 20:54.559
but we have to rebuild the Hot
Chocolate Bar back to the way it was.

20:54.595 --> 20:56.632
(impersonating Viking guy) Let us
reclaim the fortress of our...

20:56.656 --> 20:58.430
I can't do it.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.983
The Viking guy is so cool.

21:01.018 --> 21:02.018
I'm gonna go take a nap.

21:05.781 --> 21:07.673
('80s rock music playing)

21:09.594 --> 21:10.594
Here we go.

21:36.721 --> 21:39.513
People of Vuuugle,

21:39.548 --> 21:43.150
I stayed up all night to give
you the new and improved

21:43.186 --> 21:44.376
Hot Chocolate Bar.

21:48.374 --> 21:51.300
No mammoth pelts,
or otters, or...

21:53.120 --> 21:54.120
Uh-oh.

21:56.766 --> 21:57.766
Where am I?

21:59.410 --> 22:00.410
(lisping) 'Sup?

22:02.338 --> 22:03.338
(in normal voice) 'Sup.

22:04.890 --> 22:08.759
Guys, I give up.

22:08.794 --> 22:11.345
I never had a plan to replace
the Hot Chocolate Bar.

22:11.380 --> 22:14.014
It's just... you all
believed in me,

22:14.049 --> 22:16.925
and I didn't want
to let you down.

22:16.961 --> 22:21.596
But there is someone here
who has true vision,

22:21.632 --> 22:24.074
who we should've been
listening to all along...

22:24.109 --> 22:25.784
(sighs) Thank you, Dirk.

22:25.819 --> 22:27.202
Horse-face guy!

22:27.237 --> 22:28.237
What?

22:30.382 --> 22:33.050
(dance music playing)

22:37.231 --> 22:38.430
I get it!

22:43.011 --> 22:45.437
<i>Okay, let me suggest
another solution.</i>

22:47.725 --> 22:48.725
<i>My new office.</i>

22:50.761 --> 22:53.012
<i>It made no sense
being on the second floor.</i>

22:53.047 --> 22:55.163
<i>No more carrying me up
the stairs, Viking guy.</i>

22:55.198 --> 22:57.491
It has been an honor.

22:59.595 --> 23:00.595
<i>Indeed.</i>

23:03.382 --> 23:05.507
Sorry for messing up, everybody.

23:05.542 --> 23:07.517
I know it's not much,

23:07.553 --> 23:09.545
but I do have this dartboard.

23:11.207 --> 23:12.940
Dartboard, huh?

23:12.975 --> 23:14.191
Sounds kinda lame...

23:14.226 --> 23:16.184
Oh, man this is fun!

23:16.219 --> 23:17.344
All (shouting): Yeah!

23:18.923 --> 23:20.463
I don't know.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.924
Don't we all deserve
better than a dartboard?

23:22.959 --> 23:25.068
Yeah.

23:25.103 --> 23:26.996
We do deserve better.

23:27.031 --> 23:33.076
(shouting) Yeah!
