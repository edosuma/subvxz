00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:07.218 --> 00:08.589
I found you some glasses.

00:08.589 --> 00:11.302
Great. I wanna make
a good impression

00:11.302 --> 00:13.054
at work today.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.895
And everyone knows
glasses make you look smarter.

00:19.060 --> 00:22.233
Uh, these don't exactly scream
successful businesswoman.

00:22.233 --> 00:24.735
Hey, I'm working with
the Diaz Halloween box here.

00:24.735 --> 00:26.697
Designer options
are limited.

00:26.697 --> 00:28.569
So listen to this.

00:28.569 --> 00:30.571
When a Diaz kid turns 13,

00:30.571 --> 00:32.703
they get to work at
Dad's marina store.

00:32.703 --> 00:35.576
I know. You're waiting
for the cool part.

00:35.576 --> 00:38.459
Well, I've got
this million-dollar idea

00:38.459 --> 00:40.711
that I've been
working on for months,

00:40.711 --> 00:42.123
and I'm gonna
sell Dad on it.

00:42.123 --> 00:45.586
I've also got these.

00:47.298 --> 00:49.430
- Seriously?
- I took the mustache off.

00:53.264 --> 00:56.097
Truth is, I don't have to worry
about looking professional.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.439
My idea is going
to stand on its own,

00:58.439 --> 01:00.771
and it's going to turn Dad's
bait and tackle shop

01:00.771 --> 01:02.563
into a sweet hang.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.815
We're going to make this...

01:04.815 --> 01:06.607
into this.

01:06.607 --> 01:08.109
Harley's Slushy Shack.

01:08.109 --> 01:09.950
If you can say that
five times fast,

01:09.950 --> 01:11.532
you get one free.

01:11.532 --> 01:14.365
Dad is going to be stoked
when I tell him my plan.

01:14.365 --> 01:15.696
Not happening.

01:15.696 --> 01:17.288
I am no longer
accepting applications

01:17.288 --> 01:19.120
from people
in our family.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.293
But Dad, every Diaz kid so far
has had a chance to work here.

01:22.293 --> 01:24.665
Exactly. Why do you think
I'm saying no?

01:24.665 --> 01:26.207
I wouldn't buy that.

01:26.207 --> 01:28.259
It makes you look
a little bit puffy.

01:28.259 --> 01:30.301
Just because you're fishing

01:30.301 --> 01:32.763
doesn't mean you have
to look like a whale.

01:32.763 --> 01:34.475
Sorry.

01:34.475 --> 01:36.137
I can't sell you Jerry.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.848
Not for bait.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.680
Oh, oh, and definitely
not Earl.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.611 --> 01:52.153
Sorry, honey.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.155
Family and business
just don't mix.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.327
Neither do Beast
and bath time,

01:56.327 --> 01:58.118
but you still give it
a try once in a while.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.291
Hey, my dream was to have
all you kids working here,

02:00.291 --> 02:01.952
but it conflicted with
my other dream

02:01.952 --> 02:04.004
of not going
out of business.

02:04.004 --> 02:06.917
But Dad, my slushy idea
was going to pull
this place out of the dumps.

02:06.917 --> 02:08.669
The dumps?

02:08.669 --> 02:10.841
This store supports
a family of nine.

02:10.841 --> 02:13.053
Yes, and the slushy business

02:13.053 --> 02:16.056
was going to be my escape
from that family of nine.

02:16.056 --> 02:19.350
I need to prove to Dad
that I'm different.

02:19.350 --> 02:22.603
That I can succeed
where others have failed.

02:22.603 --> 02:25.526
That mistakes of the past
can stay in the past.

02:25.526 --> 02:27.027
Plus, if I can't
work at the store,

02:27.027 --> 02:28.529
I'm stuck doing chores.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.371
You missed a spot.

02:40.371 --> 02:42.703
I'd point out
other mistakes,

02:42.703 --> 02:46.377
but I'm off to the ball
with Price Cuffingham.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.052
I can't let that happen.

02:52.052 --> 02:54.345
There's going to be
a Harley Slushy Slack...

02:54.345 --> 02:56.257
Shushy Sack...

02:56.257 --> 02:58.349
Slussy Sack.

02:58.349 --> 03:00.891
Okay, I may have to
change the name,

03:00.891 --> 03:02.563
but it's on.

03:57.318 --> 04:00.070
Dad, I know you're not sure
about me working at the marina,

04:00.070 --> 04:04.785
so I put together 101 reasons
why you should hire Harley.

04:04.785 --> 04:06.417
Number one...

04:06.417 --> 04:08.419
All right, guys,
listen up.

04:08.419 --> 04:10.000
I need everybody's attention,

04:10.000 --> 04:11.832
and I know I only have
two minutes

04:11.832 --> 04:14.425
- before you all lose focus.
- ( making funny voices )

04:14.425 --> 04:17.378
Two minutes?
That's being generous.

04:17.378 --> 04:19.640
I just found out
we're the only family

04:19.640 --> 04:21.642
that doesn't have a photo
in the church directory.

04:21.642 --> 04:25.386
Based on the twin's behavior
at church, maybe that's best.

04:25.386 --> 04:29.480
People need to see the Diazes
are a nice, normal family,

04:29.480 --> 04:31.692
despite the small fire
in the confessional booth.

04:31.692 --> 04:34.855
We have tons of pictures.
Just send one over.
Problem solved.

04:34.855 --> 04:37.157
Anyway, first reason
why I should work at the marina.

04:37.157 --> 04:38.859
I'm patient.

04:38.859 --> 04:41.161
We do have
a ton of photos,

04:41.161 --> 04:43.664
none of which I'm in because
I'm always stuck taking them.

04:43.664 --> 04:45.666
We only have one photo
of the whole family.

04:47.368 --> 04:49.870
I like that one.
I look cute scared.

04:49.870 --> 04:52.963
No. The church photographer
will be here Saturday at 3:00.

04:52.963 --> 04:55.506
Attendance mandatory.

04:55.506 --> 04:58.719
Okay, reason number two why
I should work at the store.

04:58.719 --> 05:00.471
I'm sorry, Harls.
I've made my decision.

05:00.471 --> 05:02.182
Please, not another word.

05:09.019 --> 05:11.311
Nope.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.604
Eh, good enough.

05:17.107 --> 05:18.699
"Reason number 14.

05:18.699 --> 05:21.612
Hire Harley for
the sweet smell of success."

05:30.711 --> 05:32.413
"Reason number 37.

05:32.413 --> 05:34.294
Harley can make
your business take off."

05:40.050 --> 05:41.802
HARLEY: Reason number 100,

05:41.802 --> 05:43.884
brought to you by
 the Harley station.

05:43.884 --> 05:45.596
First up,
 an oldie but a goodie.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.267
Let Harley help.

05:47.267 --> 05:49.730
♪ If Harley could work
 at the store... ♪

05:49.730 --> 05:52.473
All right, you can
work at the store.

05:52.473 --> 05:54.605
Just make this stop.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.977
Awesome!

05:56.977 --> 05:58.939
I won't let you down
like the other kids.

05:58.939 --> 06:02.533
I found a used slushy machine
for only $500.

06:02.533 --> 06:05.826
You haven't even started,
and I'm $500 in the hole?

06:05.826 --> 06:07.748
Look, you can work
at the marina,

06:07.748 --> 06:09.580
but you can't cause trouble
or cost me money.

06:09.580 --> 06:11.492
I can live with that.

06:11.492 --> 06:14.334
And I won't bother you again.
Starting now.

06:16.497 --> 06:19.550
Here, kitty, kitty.
Breakfast time.

06:19.550 --> 06:21.001
Hey, you found a cat.

06:21.001 --> 06:22.463
I'm guessing this is why

06:22.463 --> 06:24.174
you've been stuffing bacon
down your pants.

06:24.174 --> 06:27.848
No, stuffing bacon down my pants
is how the cat found me.

06:27.848 --> 06:30.390
Okay, but he probably
belongs to somebody.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.684
- Does he have a collar?
- Nope. He showed up naked.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.606
Man, I've always
wanted a pet.

06:35.606 --> 06:37.818
But Mom and Dad said
they've already dealt with

06:37.818 --> 06:39.650
enough things that
poop where they shouldn't.

06:39.650 --> 06:41.982
- Can I play with him?
- Can you fit under the house?

06:45.285 --> 06:47.287
Hey, maybe if we convince
Mom and Dad we're responsible,

06:47.287 --> 06:48.949
they'll let us keep him.

06:48.949 --> 06:50.621
Sounds like a lot of work.

06:50.621 --> 06:52.953
Come on, wouldn't it be
great if we had a family pet?

06:52.953 --> 06:56.296
I already have a pet,
under the house.

06:57.297 --> 06:58.499
I may be stuck under here.

06:58.499 --> 07:00.631
Big-people problems.

07:02.963 --> 07:05.345
Okay, here's
my latest invention

07:05.345 --> 07:07.257
which costs you no money
or concern.

07:07.257 --> 07:08.969
- Is that my tarp?
- Minus the tarp,

07:08.969 --> 07:11.722
to be put back later,
I present to you

07:11.722 --> 07:13.143
without further ado,

07:13.143 --> 07:15.225
and no idea
what ado means,

07:15.225 --> 07:16.687
but we will have
no further of it.

07:18.519 --> 07:21.151
The Slushinator.

07:26.236 --> 07:28.028
Pretty cool, huh?

07:28.028 --> 07:29.660
Custom built to use
my biggest source

07:29.660 --> 07:32.372
of free energy,
Lewie and Beast.

07:32.372 --> 07:35.415
- What am I paying them?
- Our weight in slushy.

07:35.415 --> 07:39.670
See? Self-sustaining, and costs
you no money for electricity.

07:39.670 --> 07:42.002
Plus, customers
get a show,

07:42.002 --> 07:44.174
and Lewie and Beast
will be so tired

07:44.174 --> 07:46.046
by the end of the day,
it'll be like you only

07:46.046 --> 07:48.008
- have five kids.
- On the other hand,

07:48.008 --> 07:49.680
I'm coming to work
with three kids instead of none.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.391
Just say yes.

07:51.391 --> 07:53.894
We were behind the tarp
for 45 minutes.

08:00.020 --> 08:01.772
Diaz colada.

08:01.772 --> 08:04.024
A trip to the islands
for only four dollars.

08:04.024 --> 08:06.196
You can sucker people into
paying four bucks

08:06.196 --> 08:08.368
for some color, sugar,
and ice?

08:09.369 --> 08:11.201
Pedal away, gentlemen.

08:14.575 --> 08:17.918
Hey, Rachel, just so
you don't, you know,
get us banned from church,

08:17.918 --> 08:19.670
show me the outfit you're
wearing in the photo tomorrow.

08:19.670 --> 08:21.622
- I got mine.
- No sports jerseys.

08:21.622 --> 08:24.214
- Rethinking mine.
- I've narrowed it down

08:24.214 --> 08:26.887
to a few options
that are totally on point.

08:29.179 --> 08:31.682
Too short, too tight,
too much, too little.

08:31.682 --> 08:34.224
You do understand this is for
the church directory,

08:34.224 --> 08:35.976
not a hip-hop video.

08:35.976 --> 08:38.477
Mom, you should always
display your "A" game.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.520
This isn't just
for people at church.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.693
It's also being seen by all the
Catholic boys' schools in town.

08:43.693 --> 08:46.737
Wait, even St. Joseph's
where Johnny Hoskins suits up?

08:46.737 --> 08:49.239
- I don't know that name.
- He's the mascot.

08:49.239 --> 08:51.742
That's why. The only boys
I know dress like people,

08:51.742 --> 08:54.074
- not birds.
- He is an eagle!

08:54.074 --> 08:57.417
And when Johnny soars,
the crowd goes wild!

09:07.217 --> 09:08.759
Cherry me, my man.

09:08.759 --> 09:10.510
Can do, partner.

09:17.137 --> 09:19.179
All in the wrist.

09:19.179 --> 09:22.142
Okay, we have
one Blueberry-oncé,

09:22.142 --> 09:24.444
and one Grapey Perry
coming right up.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.813
How's our little friend?
Sill won't come out, huh?

10:02.813 --> 10:04.224
My friend.

10:04.224 --> 10:05.986
I don't think
he likes you.

10:05.986 --> 10:07.357
He hasn't even met me.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.650
Sometimes you just know.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.732
Well, he'll warm up to me.

10:11.732 --> 10:13.994
I'm gonna hit the pet store
and grab a few things.

10:13.994 --> 10:16.196
That way, if Mom and Dad
let us have him,

10:16.196 --> 10:18.659
we're all set.
Just the bare essentials.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.372
One bed shaped like
a hamburger bun.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.704
One kitty yoga mat.

10:23.704 --> 10:26.506
One cat beret.

10:26.506 --> 10:28.799
And a bow tie to go
with the cat beret.

10:28.799 --> 10:29.920
Did you get cat food?

10:29.920 --> 10:32.132
- I'll be back.
- Yeah.

10:36.967 --> 10:39.219
Great work today, fellas.

10:39.219 --> 10:40.681
It's like you were
born to slush.

10:40.681 --> 10:42.853
Yeah. Anyway,
we quit.

10:42.853 --> 10:45.355
What? We had a deal.

10:45.355 --> 10:48.228
You were going to work until I
could buy my own slushy machine.

10:48.228 --> 10:50.861
We're tired
of being in here.

10:50.861 --> 10:53.694
We wanna go outside
and get some exercise.

10:53.694 --> 10:56.196
Yeah. Maybe go
ride our bikes.

10:56.196 --> 10:59.039
You've been riding
bikes all day.

10:59.039 --> 11:01.702
Sorry, Harley.
Team decision.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.876
There's my little
slushy star.

11:05.876 --> 11:07.708
You were drawing
so many people,

11:07.708 --> 11:10.751
the lines were backing up
in the store all morning.

11:10.751 --> 11:13.593
Well, that's not going to be
a problem anymore.

11:13.593 --> 11:15.756
It sure won't,
not if we cut a window
right next to the counter.

11:15.756 --> 11:19.559
This way, we can get customers
from inside and outside.

11:19.559 --> 11:23.393
That sounds like that
money and trouble you
were trying to avoid.

11:23.393 --> 11:25.896
It's about me
saying I'm sorry

11:25.896 --> 11:28.228
for pre-judging you
based on your
brothers and sisters.

11:28.228 --> 11:30.230
Dad, I can't
let you do that.

11:30.230 --> 11:32.572
Oh, I'm not doing it.

11:32.572 --> 11:33.693
Hit it, Tony.

11:39.579 --> 11:41.621
Reason number one
to fire Harley.

11:41.621 --> 11:43.533
She put a giant hole
in the wall.

11:43.533 --> 11:45.125
( chainsaw buzzing )

11:50.420 --> 11:51.922
What do you think?

11:51.922 --> 11:53.593
I'm gonna add
"world's best."

11:53.593 --> 11:55.385
Why not?
No one checks.

11:55.385 --> 11:58.759
Well, if it doesn't work,
we can always fix it, right?

11:58.759 --> 12:01.972
No. Mm-mm.

12:01.972 --> 12:03.764
This ain't goin' back in.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.146
Broke my chainsaw
gettin' it out.

12:06.146 --> 12:08.108
♪ If Harley could work
at the store ♪

12:08.108 --> 12:11.021
♪ You something-something
catchy ♪

12:11.021 --> 12:14.154
If I don't get Lewie and Beast
working for me again,

12:14.154 --> 12:17.117
he's going to be singing
a whole different song.

12:17.117 --> 12:20.951
And if they won't play ball,
I'll have to play dirty.

12:20.951 --> 12:24.624
It's such a shame
you're walking away
from the slushy world.

12:24.624 --> 12:26.957
Yeah, Beast and I
have bigger plans.

12:26.957 --> 12:28.869
Today, we're digging
for mummies.

12:28.869 --> 12:31.792
Beast does the digging,
and if we find any mummies,

12:31.792 --> 12:33.964
I sell them on the internet.

12:33.964 --> 12:35.796
Smart.

12:35.796 --> 12:38.799
I could always tell you were
the brains of the operation.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.431
But I can't believe
you're wasting that talent

12:41.431 --> 12:43.513
on something
other than slushies.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.475
It's not just me
saying this.

12:45.475 --> 12:47.978
The scout from
the National Slushy Federation

12:47.978 --> 12:50.020
- thought so, too.
- There was a scout there?

12:50.020 --> 12:51.601
Yes.

12:51.601 --> 12:54.154
Herbert von Slushcheck.

12:54.154 --> 12:55.655
He said if you keep it up,

12:55.655 --> 12:58.028
there's talk of putting
a statue of you

12:58.028 --> 13:00.200
- in front of their
headquarters.
- Cool!

13:00.200 --> 13:01.862
I've got the pose already.

13:03.824 --> 13:07.457
You're going to go down
in slushy history.

13:07.457 --> 13:10.831
- You're the star
of this operation.
- I am?

13:10.831 --> 13:12.913
That's what the guy
from the federation said.

13:12.913 --> 13:15.335
He was talking about
giving you a star

13:15.335 --> 13:17.297
on the slushy
walk of fame,

13:17.297 --> 13:20.760
right next to the guy
who invented non-staining syrup.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.262
One guy did that?

13:22.262 --> 13:25.515
Yes.
Horace Noredmouth.

13:25.515 --> 13:28.849
Horace Noredmouth.
Beast.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.520
I can totally see that.

13:36.696 --> 13:38.068
And here is your
Lady Ga-guava.

13:41.201 --> 13:44.534
Good work. I know
you're trying your best
to keep up.

13:44.534 --> 13:46.246
I'm not trying my best.

13:46.246 --> 13:48.328
I am the best.
I'm the brains.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.210
That's the most
important thing

13:50.210 --> 13:51.541
when it comes to slushies.

13:51.541 --> 13:53.503
Who sold you
that nonsense?

13:53.503 --> 13:55.835
Only the top scout
in the business.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.008
Herbert von Slushcheck.

13:58.008 --> 14:00.050
What kind of
fake name is that?

14:00.050 --> 14:02.552
I'm getting a star next to
Horace Noredmouth.

14:02.552 --> 14:05.845
Big deal. I'm
getting a statue.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.847
People will be
stomping on your star

14:07.847 --> 14:11.521
taking a picture of
my slushy-pouring pose.

14:11.521 --> 14:15.565
Oh, yeah?
Well, this is
my slushy-pouring pose.

14:19.649 --> 14:23.283
Ah, yeah!
( laughing )

14:32.252 --> 14:34.084
Guys! Guys!

14:34.084 --> 14:35.165
What's going on?

14:35.165 --> 14:37.587
I refuse to work
side by side

14:37.587 --> 14:40.760
with this sorry
sack of slush.

14:40.760 --> 14:43.423
I refuse to work
side by side

14:43.423 --> 14:47.307
on a Slushinator that's
touched this monkey butt's butt.

14:50.270 --> 14:53.063
Man, first my older siblings
mess me up,

14:53.063 --> 14:54.894
and now my younger.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.606
Why didn't someone tell me
it was a bad idea

14:56.606 --> 14:58.478
to hire family?

14:58.478 --> 15:00.480
Oh, right.

15:02.322 --> 15:04.154
Oh, hey, I need someone
to find out

15:04.154 --> 15:06.236
which kind of cat food
is tastier.

15:06.236 --> 15:08.448
- Is Beast around?
- Beast? Not really
ringin' a bell.

15:08.448 --> 15:10.290
Twin brother,
best friend.

15:10.290 --> 15:11.952
The guy you
always hang out with.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.414
Oh, yes,
the simple one.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.086
Well, that's
all over now.

15:16.086 --> 15:17.667
I'm a solo act.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.459
What?

15:22.592 --> 15:26.256
How dare you
touch my stuff?

15:28.468 --> 15:29.849
Please tell me
that's a filthy rag.

15:29.849 --> 15:31.551
Those are
my lucky undies.

15:31.551 --> 15:33.143
I never wash them.

15:35.015 --> 15:37.057
Hey, what did you do
to Lewie and Beast?

15:37.057 --> 15:39.319
I had Lewie's dirty
underwear on my head.

15:39.319 --> 15:40.900
See how stiff my hair is?

15:40.900 --> 15:43.823
That's not gel.
That's hand sanitizer.

15:43.823 --> 15:45.655
Business seems to have
dropped off.

15:45.655 --> 15:47.367
Hey, where are the boys?

15:47.367 --> 15:49.869
They're on a break.

15:49.869 --> 15:52.993
Geez, Dad, you can't just work
your employees to the ground.

15:52.993 --> 15:56.416
Good call.
Hey, Tony, take five.

15:56.416 --> 15:58.378
You know what?
Take six.

16:01.171 --> 16:03.503
Look, whatever happened
between Lewie and Beast
wasn't my fault.

16:03.503 --> 16:05.465
All I did was
tell each of them

16:05.465 --> 16:06.586
they were better
than the other

16:06.586 --> 16:08.218
so I could continue
making money.

16:08.218 --> 16:10.430
Sounding a little
like your fault.

16:10.430 --> 16:12.972
Splitting them up,
not a good move, Harley.

16:15.305 --> 16:16.726
What are you doing?

16:16.726 --> 16:19.099
Practicing my smile
for the church photo.

16:19.099 --> 16:21.441
I have to impress
Johnny Hoskins.

16:21.441 --> 16:23.363
He's the Eagles mascot.
Go play with Beast.

16:23.363 --> 16:24.864
I can be quiet.

16:24.864 --> 16:27.067
Did you know that,
when you smile,

16:27.067 --> 16:28.908
one eye goes up
and the other goes down?

16:28.908 --> 16:31.281
It's cool, like you're
melting or something.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.453
- Go!
- Sorry.

16:33.453 --> 16:35.035
Pretend I'm not here.

16:39.579 --> 16:41.121
Too much gums.

16:43.423 --> 16:45.885
This is how you smile.

16:47.427 --> 16:50.300
See? Cute, not crazy.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.302
I don't see any difference.

16:52.302 --> 16:54.224
That's the first sign
of craziness.

17:00.480 --> 17:02.312
Beast, please!

17:02.312 --> 17:03.563
I wanna look good
for this picture.

17:03.563 --> 17:05.355
Ever since
my hair dryer broke,

17:05.355 --> 17:07.696
these vents are the only
place I can get a good blow-out.

17:07.696 --> 17:09.739
No problem.

17:09.739 --> 17:12.071
What are you doing?

17:12.071 --> 17:13.953
I'm having window races.

17:13.953 --> 17:16.246
Who do you like,
driver's side or passenger?

17:16.246 --> 17:17.997
Neither. Shouldn't you
be with Lewie?

17:17.997 --> 17:19.579
Who needs Lewie?

17:19.579 --> 17:21.921
He doesn't know
anything about fun.

17:21.921 --> 17:24.294
Now, driver's or passenger's?
Driver's or passenger's?

17:24.294 --> 17:26.256
Driver's or passenger's?

17:26.256 --> 17:28.167
Fine. Driver's.

17:31.010 --> 17:34.344
Driver's side wins!

17:34.344 --> 17:36.766
- ( honks horn )
- Whoo! Whoo!

17:36.766 --> 17:38.938
( continues honking horn )

17:38.938 --> 17:40.810
Ah, finally.

17:40.810 --> 17:42.602
The perfect outfit.

17:42.602 --> 17:44.604
This says church
without all the church.

17:44.604 --> 17:47.107
I think it's awesome.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.488
My teacher wore one
just like it.

17:49.649 --> 17:50.950
Your teacher?

17:50.950 --> 17:52.452
Funny thing with her.

17:52.452 --> 17:54.784
I could never tell
where her nose hair ended

17:54.784 --> 17:57.117
- and her mustache began.
- Ugh!

17:59.459 --> 18:01.541
RACHEL: Get it off!

18:01.541 --> 18:03.123
GEORGIE: I don't know
how to smile.

18:03.123 --> 18:05.125
I'm not being in
any picture with Beast!

18:05.125 --> 18:07.337
I'm not being in
any picture with Lewie!

18:07.337 --> 18:09.589
Also, I locked
the keys in the car.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.171
Didn't I tell you?

18:11.171 --> 18:13.012
You split up Lewie and Beast,
bad things happen.

18:13.012 --> 18:16.176
Great. Now I glued
my eye shut.

18:16.176 --> 18:19.389
I have to fix
this unholy mess.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.811
( doorbell ringing )

18:26.486 --> 18:28.648
Right after the church
photographer

18:28.648 --> 18:30.400
takes a picture of it.

18:32.031 --> 18:35.535
Hi. Bad timing.

18:35.535 --> 18:37.997
We're actually right
in the middle of our
family prayer circle.

18:37.997 --> 18:40.540
MOTHER: Beast, for
the last time, pants on.

18:40.540 --> 18:43.082
Everybody needs pants on.

18:43.082 --> 18:44.874
Like the Good Book says,

18:44.874 --> 18:47.877
thou shalt always
wear thy pants,

18:47.877 --> 18:50.089
willst thou...

18:50.089 --> 18:52.011
Come back in two hours.

18:55.014 --> 18:57.677
Okay, that bought me
some time to make things right.

18:57.677 --> 19:00.019
Sorry I dragged You
into that.

19:08.358 --> 19:10.770
New plan. We sneak the cat
into the family picture.

19:10.770 --> 19:15.235
Once he's in the photo, Taffy's
officially in the family.

19:15.235 --> 19:17.907
Taffy? What else
you got, Grandma?

19:17.907 --> 19:19.779
Hey, you spend your allowance
at Pet City,

19:19.779 --> 19:21.371
you can name the cat.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.418
Hey, there's no rhinoceros
in here.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.500
You promised me
the rhinoceros.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.632
This fight has to end.

19:32.632 --> 19:34.674
And not just because there's
a photographer due back here

19:34.674 --> 19:36.175
any minute.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.887
Because you're
Lewie and Beast.

19:37.887 --> 19:39.389
Beast and Lewie.

19:39.389 --> 19:41.431
Born first.
Just saying.

19:41.431 --> 19:44.013
Either way.

19:44.013 --> 19:46.726
You go together like
pickles and bananas.

19:46.726 --> 19:50.019
I mean, only you think
they go together,

19:50.019 --> 19:51.901
but both of you do.

19:51.901 --> 19:53.903
So what do you say?

19:53.903 --> 19:56.776
- Friends?
- BOTH: No.

19:58.408 --> 20:00.910
Look. A pig
on a pogo stick.

20:04.244 --> 20:07.587
Whoa! That's not
a pig on a pogo stick.

20:07.587 --> 20:09.589
No, it's even better.

20:09.589 --> 20:11.130
We don't have
to feed it.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.965
The perfect two-man bike
for the ultimate team.

20:15.965 --> 20:20.099
Sleek little puppy with
onboard water cannons.

20:20.099 --> 20:21.841
It takes two of you
to pedal.

20:21.841 --> 20:23.973
That means you go
twice as fast.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.766
That means it's
twice as dangerous.

20:26.766 --> 20:28.768
We could get
twice as hurt.

20:28.768 --> 20:30.900
Only if you work together.

20:30.900 --> 20:33.112
But if that's not
going to happen...

20:37.156 --> 20:39.659
We're off to the National
Slushy Federation

20:39.659 --> 20:41.781
to tell them we've
resolved our differences.

20:41.781 --> 20:44.324
Whoo hoo!

20:44.324 --> 20:47.076
Three, two, one.

20:47.076 --> 20:50.129
BEAST: Where's the National
Slushy Federation?

20:50.129 --> 20:52.832
Keep going.

20:52.832 --> 20:54.834
Dad was right.

20:54.834 --> 20:57.136
Family and business
 don't mix.

20:57.136 --> 20:59.639
The Slushy Shack
 was done,

20:59.639 --> 21:02.302
but it was for
 the greater good--

21:02.302 --> 21:05.515
putting our family
 back to normal.

21:05.515 --> 21:08.348
Well, Diaz normal.

21:08.348 --> 21:10.560
Wait, is that the beret
I bought for the cat?

21:10.560 --> 21:12.151
He said it wasn't
his style.

21:12.151 --> 21:13.983
Okay.

21:13.983 --> 21:15.855
You go grab him,
and on my signal,

21:15.855 --> 21:17.317
sneak him right up front
for the picture.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.319
Why do I have to do
all the work?

21:19.319 --> 21:20.660
You left me stuck
under the house.

21:20.660 --> 21:22.322
That's fair.

21:26.906 --> 21:29.499
Finally!
She's here!

21:29.499 --> 21:31.331
Okay, everyone line up.

21:31.331 --> 21:32.832
Talls in back,
shorts in front.

21:34.834 --> 21:38.127
Harls, you could've
cleaned up for the picture.

21:38.127 --> 21:39.969
Gotta think of
the family first sometime.

21:50.390 --> 21:52.892
( all chattering )

22:03.863 --> 22:06.536
That's weird.

22:06.536 --> 22:09.369
In this light,
that cat looks like a--

22:09.369 --> 22:11.711
Skunk. That's a skunk.

22:11.711 --> 22:14.874
Okay, skunks only spray
if they're scared.

22:14.874 --> 22:17.877
If we all remain
very still, nothing will--

22:17.877 --> 22:20.380
You told me
you were a cat!

22:20.380 --> 22:22.922
Bad skunk, bad skunk!

22:26.386 --> 22:28.968
HARLEY: Well, at least
Georgie looks good.

22:31.230 --> 22:32.812
She really committed
to that smile.

22:32.812 --> 22:36.065
Next year, we're sending
the Log Splash photo.

22:39.028 --> 22:40.900
So Harls,

22:40.900 --> 22:43.573
I noticed you tore up
your slushy machine
for the boys.

22:43.573 --> 22:45.535
Yeah, you were right.

22:45.535 --> 22:47.407
Mixing family and business
is a bad idea.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.749
That's too bad.

22:49.749 --> 22:51.411
I thought you handled
yourself pretty well.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.753
And you didn't
cause me any problems.

22:53.753 --> 22:56.586
Except for that big hole
you put in your wall.

22:56.586 --> 22:58.588
Actually, I'm thinking about
getting a slushy machine,

22:58.588 --> 23:01.050
and that may be
the perfect spot.

23:01.050 --> 23:04.093
If I can only find
someone to run it.

23:04.093 --> 23:07.056
Hmm.

23:07.056 --> 23:08.387
Me?

23:08.387 --> 23:10.810
Reason to hire Harley
number 102/

23:10.810 --> 23:13.853
I like spending time
with my daughter.

23:17.647 --> 23:19.108
( doorbell rings )

23:26.786 --> 23:30.289
Georgie, it's for you!

23:31.305 --> 23:37.260
