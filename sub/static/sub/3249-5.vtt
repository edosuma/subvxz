WEBVTT

00:04.280 --> 00:05.919
River?

00:06.440 --> 00:08.079
Follow that ship!

00:09.760 --> 00:12.439
Has Dr Song explained
what we're dealing with?

00:12.520 --> 00:13.599
AMY: Doctor...

00:13.680 --> 00:15.479
what's it going to do to me?

00:15.560 --> 00:18.159
Amy, not the eyes, look at the Angel,
but don't look at the eyes.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.919
OCTAVIAN: The Angel, as far as we know,
is still trapped in the ship -

00:23.000 --> 00:25.559
our mission is to get inside
and neutralise it.

00:25.680 --> 00:29.479
DOCTOR: Don't you see? All that radiation
spilling out, the drive burn.

00:29.560 --> 00:30.559
The crash of the Byzantium
wasn't an accident -

00:30.600 --> 00:33.479
it was a rescue mission for the Angels.
We're in the middle of an army.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.639
The statues are advancing
on all sides.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.559
RIVER: There's no way up, no way back,
no way out.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.679
I'm about to do something
incredibly stupid and dangerous.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.319
When I do, jump.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.719
- On my signal.
- What signal?

00:43.800 --> 00:44.959
You won't miss it.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.999
Up! Look up!

01:23.080 --> 01:25.679
- You OK?
- What happened?

01:25.760 --> 01:28.559
- We jumped.
- Jumped where?

01:28.640 --> 01:30.279
Up, up, look up!

01:30.360 --> 01:33.279
- Where are we?
- RIVER: Exactly where we were.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.479
- No, we're not.
- Move your feet!

01:36.680 --> 01:38.759
Doctor, what am I looking at? Explain.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.119
Oh, come on, Amy, think!

01:40.200 --> 01:42.759
The ship crashed
with the power still on, yeah?

01:42.840 --> 01:44.319
So what else is still on?

01:53.520 --> 01:56.559
The artificial gravity.
One good jump, and up we fell.

01:56.640 --> 02:00.319
Shot out the grav-globe to give us
an updraught, and here we are!

02:00.400 --> 02:04.479
Doctor...the statues,
they look more like Angels now.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.759
DOCTOR: They're feeding
on the radiation from the wreckage,

02:06.840 --> 02:08.879
draining all the power from the ship,
restoring themselves.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.639
Within an hour, they'll be an army.

02:13.800 --> 02:17.279
They're taking out the lights.
Look at them, look at the Angels.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.999
- Into the ship now - quickly, all of you!
- But how?

02:23.080 --> 02:24.639
Doctor!

02:25.880 --> 02:28.079
It's just a corridor,

02:28.160 --> 02:31.279
the gravity orientates to the floor.

02:31.360 --> 02:32.439
Now, in here, all of you,

02:32.520 --> 02:34.959
don't take your eyes off the Angels -
move, move, move!

02:35.040 --> 02:37.279
OCTAVIAN: OK, men, go, go, go!

02:40.120 --> 02:43.559
The Angels...presumably
they can jump up too?

02:43.640 --> 02:45.799
DOCTOR: They're here...now.

02:45.880 --> 02:49.919
- In the dark, we're finished. Run!
- This whole place is a death trap!

02:50.000 --> 02:53.319
No, it's a time bomb. Well,
it's a death trap anda time bomb.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.399
And now it's a dead end.
Nobody panic.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.959
Oh, just me, then.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.119
- What's through here?
- Secondary Flight Deck.

03:01.200 --> 03:04.519
OK, so we've basically run up
the inside of a chimney, yeah?

03:04.600 --> 03:06.879
- So what if the gravity fails?
- I've thought about that.

03:06.960 --> 03:07.919
And?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.679
And we'll all plunge to our deaths.
See, I've thought about it.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.599
Ah, the security protocols are still live.
There's no way to override them,

03:12.680 --> 03:13.959
- it's impossible.
- How impossible?

03:14.040 --> 03:15.719
Two minutes.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.399
OCTAVIAN: The hull is breached,
and the power's failing.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.759
CLERIC: Sir, incoming!
AMY: Doctor, lights!

03:35.080 --> 03:36.719
OCTAVIAN: Clerics, keep watching them.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.999
DOCTOR: And don't look at their eyes -
anywhere else, not the eyes.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.879
I've isolated the lighting grid -
they can't drain the power now.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.159
OCTAVIAN: Good work, Doctor.

03:45.200 --> 03:47.039
Yes, good, good, good. Good in many ways.
Good you like it so far...

03:47.120 --> 03:48.079
So far?!

03:48.160 --> 03:49.959
Well, there's only one way
to open this door.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.439
I guess I'll need to route
all the power in this section

03:52.520 --> 03:54.519
- through the door control.
- Good, fine, do it.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.639
Including the lights. All of them.
I'll need to turn out the lights.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.359
- OCTAVIAN: How long for?
- Fraction of a second, maybe longer.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.719
- Maybe quite a bit longer.
- Maybe?

04:04.800 --> 04:06.919
I'm guessing. We're being attacked
by statues in a crashed ship -

04:07.000 --> 04:07.959
there isn't a manual for this!

04:08.040 --> 04:10.399
Doctor, we lost the torches,
we'll be in total darkness.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.679
No other way. Bishop...

04:13.760 --> 04:17.119
Dr Song, I've lost good clerics today.
You trust this man?

04:17.240 --> 04:21.519
- I absolutely trust him.
- He's not some kind of madman, then?

04:21.600 --> 04:23.159
I absolutely trust him.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.759
Excuse me.

04:24.880 --> 04:29.039
I'm taking your word, because you're
the only one who can manage this guy.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.719
But that only works so long
as he doesn't know who you are.

04:31.800 --> 04:35.599
You cost me any more men,
and I might just tell him. Understood?

04:36.880 --> 04:38.479
Understood.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.919
- OK, Doctor, we've got your back.
- Bless you, Bishop.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.359
Combat distance, ten feet. As soon as
the lights go down, continuous fire.

04:46.480 --> 04:50.119
Full spread over the hostiles. Do not stop
firing while the lights are out.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.359
Shotgun protocol -
we don't have bullets to waste.

04:52.440 --> 04:55.119
DOCTOR: Amy, when the lights go down,
the wheel should release.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.759
- Spin it clockwise, four turns.
- Ten.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.479
No, four, four turns.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.719
Yeah, four, I heard you.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.679
Ready!

05:03.280 --> 05:06.079
On my count, then.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.439
God be with us all.

05:09.520 --> 05:13.919
Three...two...one...

05:14.000 --> 05:15.519
fire!

05:22.000 --> 05:23.119
Turn!

05:24.520 --> 05:25.639
AMY: It's opening, it's working.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.279
OCTAVIAN: Fall back!

05:43.480 --> 05:46.119
- RIVER: Doctor, quickly.
- AMY: Doctor!

05:55.760 --> 05:56.879
Doctor!

06:00.400 --> 06:03.319
AMY: What are you doing?

06:03.400 --> 06:06.919
Magnetised the door.
Nothing could turn that wheel now.

06:07.000 --> 06:07.999
Yeah?

06:12.080 --> 06:15.599
- Dear God!
- Ah, now you're getting it!

06:15.680 --> 06:18.399
You've bought us time, though,
that's good, I am good with time.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.159
Doctor!

06:23.200 --> 06:25.399
Seal that door, seal it now!

06:28.920 --> 06:32.759
- We're surrounded.
- Seal it, seal that door.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.599
- Doctor, how long have we got?
- Five minutes, max.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.119
- Nine.
- Five.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.319
Five, right, yeah.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.159
- Why did you say nine?
- I didn't.

06:43.840 --> 06:46.239
- We need another way out of here.
- There isn't one.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.439
Yeah, there is, course there is.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.319
This is a galaxy class ship,
goes for years between planet-falls.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.919
So what do they need?

06:52.040 --> 06:55.079
- Of course.
- "Of course" what? What do they need?

06:55.160 --> 06:56.479
OCTAVIAN: Can we get in there?

06:56.560 --> 06:59.719
Well, it's a sealed unit, but they
must have installed it somehow.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.479
This whole wall should slide up.

07:02.560 --> 07:06.159
There's clamps, release the clamps!

07:06.240 --> 07:09.199
What's through there?
What do they need?

07:09.280 --> 07:11.679
They need to breathe.

07:24.680 --> 07:25.919
But that's...

07:29.440 --> 07:30.519
That's a...

07:30.600 --> 07:33.399
- RIVER: It's an oxygen factory.
- It's a forest.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.759
RIVER: Yeah, it's a forest,
it's an oxygen factory.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.039
DOCTOR: And if we're lucky,
an escape route.

07:42.160 --> 07:44.839
- Eight!
- RIVER: What did you say?

07:44.920 --> 07:48.079
- Nothing.
- Is there another exit?

07:48.200 --> 07:51.039
Scan the architecture -
we don't have time to get lost in there.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.919
On it! Stay where you are
until I've checked the rad levels.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.799
But trees? On a spaceship?!

07:57.880 --> 08:01.519
Oh, more than trees, way better
than trees. You're going to love this.

08:03.840 --> 08:05.399
Tree Borgs...

08:05.480 --> 08:09.159
trees plus technology.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.919
Branches become cables,
become sensors on the hull,

08:12.000 --> 08:15.439
a forest sucking in starlight,
breathing out air.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.559
It even rains.
There's a whole mini-climate.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.839
This vault is an ecopod running
right through the heart of the ship.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.359
A forest in a bottle
on a spaceship in a maze.

08:22.440 --> 08:25.679
- Have I impressed you yet, Amy Pond?
- Seven.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.759
- Seven?
- Sorry, what?

08:28.840 --> 08:30.559
You said seven.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.399
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.759
OCTAVIAN: Doctor, there's an exit, far end
of the ship, into the Primary Flight Deck.

08:35.840 --> 08:38.159
- Good. That's where we need to go.
- Plotting a safe path now.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.399
Quick as you like!

08:39.480 --> 08:43.719
ANGEL BOB: Doctor?
Excuse me. Hello, Doctor?

08:43.800 --> 08:45.839
Angel Bob here, sir.

08:45.920 --> 08:51.399
Ah, there you are, Angel Bob.
How's life? Sorry, bad subject.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.719
The Angels are wondering
what you hope to achieve.

08:53.840 --> 08:55.919
Achieve? We're not achieving anything.
We're just hanging.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.479
It's nice in here - consoles, comfy
chairs, a forest. How's things with you?

08:59.560 --> 09:01.239
The Angels are feasting, sir.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.479
Soon we'll be able to absorb
enough power to consume this vessel,

09:05.560 --> 09:08.719
this world,
and all the stars and worlds beyond.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.079
Well, we've got comfy chairs,
did I mention?

09:11.160 --> 09:12.839
We have no need of comfy chairs.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.079
I made him say "comfy chairs"!

09:15.160 --> 09:17.759
(LAUGHS) Six.

09:17.880 --> 09:20.679
OK, Bob, enough chat. Here's what I want
to know. What have you done to Amy?

09:20.760 --> 09:24.159
- There's something in her eye.
- What's in her eye?

09:24.240 --> 09:25.799
- We are.
- What's he talking about?

09:25.880 --> 09:27.679
Doctor, I'm five.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.039
I mean, five.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.319
Fine! I'm fine.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.519
You're counting.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.599
- Counting?
- You're counting down. From ten.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.439
- You have been for a couple of minutes.
- Why?

09:43.520 --> 09:45.839
- I don't know.
- Well, counting down to what?

09:45.920 --> 09:48.639
I don't know.

09:48.720 --> 09:50.959
We shall take her.
We shall take all of you.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.599
We shall have dominion
over all time and space.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.919
Get a life, Bob.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.799
Oops, sorry again!

09:56.880 --> 09:59.759
There's power on this ship,
but nowhere near that much.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.839
With respect, sir,

10:00.920 --> 10:04.079
there's more power on this ship
than you yet understand.

10:04.160 --> 10:07.319
- (SCREECHING)
- What is that? Dear God, what is it?

10:09.960 --> 10:10.959
They're back.

10:11.040 --> 10:13.759
It's hard to put it in your terms,
Dr Song,

10:13.840 --> 10:16.199
but as best as I understand it,

10:16.280 --> 10:18.239
the Angels are laughing.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.719
Laughing?

10:20.800 --> 10:22.719
Because you haven't noticed yet, sir.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.679
The Doctor in the TARDIS hasn't noticed.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.879
- Doctor...
- No, wait, there's something I've...

10:34.160 --> 10:35.199
...missed.

10:39.040 --> 10:42.279
That's...that's like
the crack from my bedroom wall

10:42.360 --> 10:44.079
- from when I was a little girl.
- Yes.

10:45.840 --> 10:49.639
Two parts of space and time
that should never have touched.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.519
OK, enough, we're moving out!

10:54.600 --> 10:56.519
- Agreed. Doctor?
- Yeah. Fine!

10:56.600 --> 10:59.159
- What are you doing?
- Right with you.

10:59.240 --> 11:03.759
- We're not leaving without you!
- Oh, yes, you are. Bishop?

11:03.840 --> 11:06.759
- Miss Pond, Dr Song, now!
- AMY: Doctor, come on!

11:06.840 --> 11:09.879
So, what are you?

11:09.960 --> 11:12.799
Oh, that's bad.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.119
Ah, that's extremely very not good.

11:24.960 --> 11:28.679
Do...not...blink.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.599
Ah...

11:35.680 --> 11:38.159
Argh!

11:51.640 --> 11:52.639
Amy?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.759
Amy, what's wrong?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.439
Why am I not dead, then?

12:04.840 --> 12:06.879
Good and not so good.

12:08.240 --> 12:12.039
Oh, this isn't even a little bit good.
I mean, is that it?

12:12.120 --> 12:14.399
Is that the power
that brought you here?

12:14.520 --> 12:16.359
That's pure time energy,
you can't feed on that, that's not power,

12:16.440 --> 12:18.039
that's the fire
at the end of the universe.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.199
- And I'll tell you something else...
- (RUMBLING)

12:22.720 --> 12:24.239
Never let me talk!

12:27.760 --> 12:30.319
- Amy, what's wrong?
- Four.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.439
Med-scanner, now!

12:44.880 --> 12:48.359
Dr Song, we can't stay here -
we've got to keep moving.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.919
We wait for the Doctor.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.839
Our mission
is to make this wreckage safe

12:53.920 --> 12:56.639
and neutralise the Angels.
Until that is achieved...

12:56.720 --> 12:58.959
Father Octavian,
when the Doctor's in the room,

12:59.040 --> 13:01.199
your one and only mission
is to keep him alive long enough

13:01.280 --> 13:04.759
to get everyone else home.
And trust me, it's not easy.

13:04.840 --> 13:07.439
Now, if he's dead back there,
I'll never forgive myself,

13:07.520 --> 13:11.079
and if he's alive,
I'll never forgive him.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.839
And, Doctor, you're standing
right behind me, aren't you?

13:13.920 --> 13:15.679
Oh, yeah.

13:15.760 --> 13:18.559
- I hate you!
- You don't.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.799
Bishop, the Angels are in the forest.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.879
OCTAVIAN: We need visual contact
on every line of approach.

13:21.960 --> 13:23.039
How did you get past them?

13:23.120 --> 13:25.159
I found a crack in the wall and told them
it was the end of the universe.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.759
What was it?

13:26.840 --> 13:29.319
The end of the universe.
Let's have a look, then.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.999
- So what's wrong with me?
- RIVER: Nothing, you're fine.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.519
- Everything, you're dying.
- Doctor!

13:34.600 --> 13:38.279
Yes, you're right, if we lie to her,
she'll get all better(!) Right, Amy.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.239
Amy , Amy ,
what's the matter with Amelia?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.719
Something's in her eye -
what does that mean?

13:41.800 --> 13:42.959
- Does it mean anything?
- Doctor...

13:43.040 --> 13:44.039
- Busy!
- Scared!

13:44.120 --> 13:46.639
- Course, you're dying, shut up!
- OK, let him think.

13:46.720 --> 13:48.999
What happened?

13:49.120 --> 13:51.599
She stared at the Angel, she looked into
the eyes of an Angel for too long...

13:51.680 --> 13:53.279
Sir! Angel, incoming!

13:55.400 --> 13:56.879
And here.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.519
Keep visual contact -
do not let it move!

14:03.000 --> 14:04.879
Come on, come on, come on,
wakey, wakey!

14:04.960 --> 14:06.999
She watched an Angel climb out
of the screen,

14:07.080 --> 14:10.599
- she stared at the Angel, and, and...
- The image of an Angel is an Angel.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.319
A living mental image
in a living human mind.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.199
We stare at them to stop them
getting closer, we don't even blink,

14:15.280 --> 14:16.839
and that is exactly what they want,

14:16.920 --> 14:19.119
cos as long as our eyes are open,
they can climb inside.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.119
There's an Angel in her mind!

14:22.240 --> 14:23.759
Three.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.799
Doctor, it's coming, I can feel it.
I'm going to die!

14:28.880 --> 14:31.999
Please just shut up, I'm thinking.
Now counting, what's that about?

14:32.080 --> 14:34.239
Bob, why are they making her count?

14:34.320 --> 14:36.999
- To make her afraid, sir.
- OK, but why, what for?

14:37.080 --> 14:39.119
For fun, sir.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.239
Oh...argh!

14:45.240 --> 14:48.519
Doctor, what's happening to me?
Explain!

14:48.600 --> 14:51.559
Inside your head, in the vision centres
of your brain, there's an Angel.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.119
It's like there's a screen,
a virtual screen inside your mind,

14:54.200 --> 14:56.519
and the Angel is climbing out of it
and it's coming...

14:56.600 --> 14:58.119
to shut you off.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.359
Then what I do?

15:00.480 --> 15:03.439
If it was a real screen, what would we do?
We'd pull the plug, kill the power.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.479
But we can't just knock her out -

15:04.560 --> 15:06.479
- the Angel would just take over!
- Then what? Quickly!

15:06.560 --> 15:08.799
We've got to shut down
the vision centres of her brain,

15:08.880 --> 15:12.599
- pull the plug, starve the Angel.
- Doctor, she's got seconds.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.039
How would you starve your lungs?

15:14.120 --> 15:16.239
- I'd stop breathing.
- Amy, close your eyes!

15:16.320 --> 15:18.679
No, no, I don't want to.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.559
Good, cos that's not you,
that's the Angel inside you, it's afraid!

15:21.640 --> 15:22.799
Do it! Close your eyes!

15:28.400 --> 15:31.399
(BEEPING)

15:31.480 --> 15:33.479
She's normalising.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.559
(SIGHS)

15:35.640 --> 15:39.199
You did it! You did it!

15:43.720 --> 15:45.759
Sir? Two more incoming.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.519
Three more over here.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.639
Still weak, dangerous to move her.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.559
- So can I open my eyes now?
- Amy, listen to me.

15:54.640 --> 15:57.719
If you open your eyes now
for more than a second, you will die.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.639
The Angel is still inside you.

15:59.720 --> 16:04.159
We haven't stopped it -
we've just sort of...paused it.

16:04.240 --> 16:07.999
You've used up your countdown.
You cannot open your eyes.

16:08.080 --> 16:10.839
Doctor, we're too exposed here,
we have to move on.

16:10.920 --> 16:13.159
We're too exposed everywhere,
and Amy can't move,

16:13.240 --> 16:14.599
and anyway that's not the plan.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.999
- RIVER: There's a plan?
- I don't know yet. I haven't finished.

16:17.080 --> 16:19.999
Right! Father, you and your clerics
will stay here, look after Amy.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.039
If anything happens to her,

16:21.120 --> 16:24.599
I'll hold every single one of you
personally responsible - twice.

16:24.680 --> 16:25.719
River, you and me,

16:25.800 --> 16:29.279
we're going to go and find
the Primary Flight Deck, which is...

16:30.960 --> 16:32.759
...a quarter of a mile straight ahead,

16:32.840 --> 16:34.399
and we'll stabilise the wreckage,
stop the Angels and cure Amy.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.999
- How?
- I'll do a thing.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.079
What thing?

16:37.160 --> 16:39.839
I don't know. It's a thing in progress,
respect the thing. Moving out!

16:39.920 --> 16:43.439
Doctor, I'm coming with you.
My clerics will look after Miss Pond.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.639
These are my best men, they'd lay down
their lives in her protection.

16:46.720 --> 16:47.879
- I don't need you.
- I don't care.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.879
- Where Dr Song goes, I go.
- What?

16:53.160 --> 16:55.799
You two engaged or something?

16:55.880 --> 16:58.959
Yes. In a manner of speaking.

16:59.040 --> 17:02.679
Marco, you're in charge till I get back.

17:02.760 --> 17:03.959
Sir!

17:05.920 --> 17:07.639
Doctor...please, can't I come with you?

17:07.720 --> 17:09.959
You'd slow us down, Miss Pond.

17:10.040 --> 17:14.159
I don't want to sound selfish,
but you'd really speed me up.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.319
You'll be safer here -
we can't protect you on the move.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.159
I'll be back for you as soon as I can,
I promise.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.719
- You always say that.
- I always come back.

17:22.800 --> 17:27.399
Good luck, everyone. Behave,
do not let that girl open her eyes.

17:27.480 --> 17:31.279
And keep watching the forest,
stop those Angels advancing.

17:31.360 --> 17:34.439
Amy, later!
River, going to need your computer!

17:36.000 --> 17:37.679
Yeah.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.799
Later.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.919
Amy, you need to start trusting me -
it's never been more important.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.879
But you don't always
tell me the truth.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.719
If I always told you the truth,
I wouldn't need you to trust me.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.199
Doctor...

17:58.280 --> 18:00.239
the crack in my wall...

18:00.320 --> 18:01.879
how can it be here?

18:01.960 --> 18:03.759
I don't know yet,
but I'm working it out.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.719
Now, listen.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.919
Remember what I told you
when you were seven?

18:09.000 --> 18:12.799
- What did you tell me?
- No, no...

18:12.880 --> 18:15.759
that's not the point.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.119
You have to remember.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.359
Remember what?

18:27.440 --> 18:32.359
Doctor?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.639
- What's that?
- Er, readings from a crack in a wall.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.359
How can a crack in a wall
be the end of the universe?

18:41.440 --> 18:43.239
I don't know, but here's what I think.
One day, there'll be a very big bang,

18:43.320 --> 18:46.919
so big every moment in history,
past and future, will crack.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.559
Is that possible? How?

18:48.640 --> 18:51.919
How can you be engaged
in a manner of speaking?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.439
Well...

18:54.520 --> 18:56.999
Sucker for a man in uniform.

19:01.320 --> 19:04.039
Dr Song is in my personal custody.

19:04.120 --> 19:07.919
I released her from the Stormcage
Containment Facility four days ago

19:08.000 --> 19:09.559
and I am legally responsible for her

19:09.640 --> 19:13.679
until she has accomplished
her mission and earned her pardon.

19:13.760 --> 19:16.799
Just so we understand each other.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.439
You were in Stormcage?

19:20.520 --> 19:22.479
(BEEPING)

19:22.560 --> 19:23.759
What? What is that?

19:23.840 --> 19:27.839
The date, the date of the explosion,
where the crack begins.

19:27.920 --> 19:31.639
And for those of us who can't read
the base code of the universe?

19:33.280 --> 19:35.119
Amy's time!

19:37.360 --> 19:40.599
So...what's happening?
Anything happening out there?

19:40.680 --> 19:42.439
CLERIC: The Angels are still grouping.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.359
Are you getting this too?

19:52.440 --> 19:54.279
- The trees? Yeah.
- What's wrong with the trees?

19:54.360 --> 19:57.679
Here too, sir.
They're ripping the Tree Borgs apart.

19:57.760 --> 20:00.119
And here,
they're taking out the lights.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.199
What is it, what's happening?
Tell me, I can't see.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.359
It's the trees, ma'am.
The trees are going out.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.119
It doesn't open it from here.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.959
But it's the Primary Flight Deck -

20:18.040 --> 20:19.679
this has got to be a service hatch
or something.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.119
Hurry up and open it -
time's running out.

20:22.200 --> 20:25.239
What? What did you say? "Time's
running out" - is that what you said?

20:25.320 --> 20:26.759
Yeah, I just meant...

20:26.840 --> 20:29.279
I know what you meant, hush!

20:29.360 --> 20:32.519
- But what if it could?
- What if whatcould?

20:32.600 --> 20:35.719
- Time. What if time could run out?
- Got it!

20:35.800 --> 20:40.239
- Angels advancing, sir.
- Over here, again.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.439
Weapons primed, combat distance
five feet, wait for it!

20:45.520 --> 20:47.919
What is it? What's happening?
Just tell me!

20:48.000 --> 20:49.799
Keep your position and, ma'am,

20:49.880 --> 20:53.079
keep your eyes shut! Wait!

20:59.400 --> 21:01.439
The ship's not on fire, is it?

21:03.880 --> 21:06.759
It can't be - the compressors
would have taken care of it.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.319
Marco, the Angels have gone.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.239
- Where'd they go?
- What, the Angels?

21:17.480 --> 21:20.279
- This side's clear too, sir.
- AMY: The Angels have gone?

21:20.360 --> 21:23.239
There's still movement out there,
but away from us now.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.759
- It's like they're running.
- Running from what?

21:28.080 --> 21:30.199
Phillip, Crispin,

21:30.280 --> 21:32.039
need to get a closer look at that.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.039
What are you all looking at?
What's there?

21:43.320 --> 21:45.999
Cracks...cracks in time,
time running out... No, couldn't be.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.759
But how is a duck pond a duck pond
if there aren't any ducks?

21:48.840 --> 21:51.079
And she didn't recognise the Daleks!

21:51.160 --> 21:56.719
OK, time can shift, time can change,
time can be rewritten. Ah! Oh!

22:00.600 --> 22:05.079
It's like...I don't know...
a curtain of energy, sort of shifting.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.119
Makes you feel weird.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.119
- Sick.
- And you think it scared the Angels?

22:10.200 --> 22:12.239
What could scare those things?

22:12.320 --> 22:14.519
- What are you doing?
- Point me at the light.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.919
You can't open your eyes.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.959
Can't open them for more than a second -
that's what the Doctor said.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.199
Still got a bit of countdown left.

22:21.280 --> 22:23.559
- Ma'am, you can't.
- I need to see it.

22:23.640 --> 22:26.839
Am I looking the right way?
I have to be quick.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.839
Very quick!

22:28.920 --> 22:31.039
OK.

22:39.120 --> 22:40.799
It's the same shape!

22:40.880 --> 22:42.279
It's the crack in my wall.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.359
Close your eyes. Now!

22:45.440 --> 22:48.279
It's following me!
How can it be following me?

22:53.680 --> 22:56.479
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

22:56.560 --> 22:58.039
It was the same shape.

22:58.120 --> 23:01.159
Marco, you want me
to get a closer look at that?

23:01.240 --> 23:03.599
Go for it.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.279
- Don't get too close.
- Hang on, what about the other two?

23:06.360 --> 23:09.599
- Why not just wait until they're back?
- What other two?

23:09.680 --> 23:11.639
The ones you sent before.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.439
I didn't send anyone before.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.159
You did, I heard you. Crispin and Phillip.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.279
Crispin and who?

23:21.520 --> 23:23.719
Dr Song, get through, now.

23:23.800 --> 23:30.879
Doctor?

23:30.960 --> 23:33.919
Time can be unwritten.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.519
Amy, there never was
a Crispin or a Phillip

23:36.600 --> 23:40.119
- on this mission, I promise you.
- No, I heard you.

23:40.200 --> 23:42.999
Before you sent Pedro,
you sent Crispin and Phillip,

23:43.080 --> 23:45.079
and now you can't
even remember them.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.839
Something happened,

23:46.920 --> 23:49.519
I don't know what,
and you don't even remember!

23:49.600 --> 23:52.519
- Pedro?
- Yeah, before you sent Pedro.

23:52.600 --> 23:55.159
Who's Pedro?

23:55.240 --> 23:57.679
It's been happening all around me,
and I haven't even noticed!

23:57.760 --> 23:59.119
Doctor, we have to move.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.159
The CyberKing! A giant Cyberman
walks over all of Victorian London,

24:02.240 --> 24:03.239
and no-one even remembers.

24:03.320 --> 24:05.079
We have to move it!
The Angels could be here any second.

24:05.160 --> 24:07.839
Never mind the Angels -
there's worse here than Angels!

24:12.360 --> 24:14.119
I beg to differ, sir.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.639
Let him go.

24:16.720 --> 24:20.759
Well, it can't let me go, sir,
not while you're looking at it.

24:20.840 --> 24:22.239
I can't stop looking at it,
it'll kill you.

24:22.320 --> 24:26.519
It's going to kill me anyway. Think it
through. There's no way out of this.

24:26.600 --> 24:29.159
- You have to leave me!
- Can't you wriggle out?

24:29.280 --> 24:32.639
No, it's too tight. You have to leave me,
sir. There's nothing you can do.

24:32.720 --> 24:34.279
Something's happening!

24:34.320 --> 24:37.079
Pedro was here a second ago,
and now you can't even remember him!

24:37.200 --> 24:40.639
There never was a Pedro -
there's only ever been the two of us here.

24:40.720 --> 24:43.279
No, there were five of us -
why can't you remember?

24:43.360 --> 24:44.439
Listen, listen,

24:44.520 --> 24:48.319
I need to get a closer look
at that...light, whatever it is.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.519
Don't worry, I won't get too close.

24:50.600 --> 24:52.919
No, you can't, you mustn't.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.999
Here, spare communicator.

24:56.080 --> 24:59.039
- I'll stay in touch the whole time.
- You won't.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.959
If you go back there, what happened
to the others will happen to you!

25:02.040 --> 25:03.999
There weren't any others!

25:04.080 --> 25:06.719
There won't be any you
if you go back there.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.519
Two minutes. I promise.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.199
Please, just listen to me!

25:19.400 --> 25:21.599
Sir, there's nothing you can do.

25:21.680 --> 25:25.399
- You're dead if I leave you.
- Yes, yes, I'm dead.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.799
- And before you go...
- I'm not going.

25:27.880 --> 25:31.079
Listen to me, it's important!
You can't trust her.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.119
- Trust who?
- River Song.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.079
You think you know her,
but you don't.

25:34.160 --> 25:37.279
You don't understand
who or what she is.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.239
- Then tell me.
- I've told you more than I should.

25:39.320 --> 25:43.319
Now, please, you have to go,
it's your duty to your friends.

25:43.400 --> 25:47.279
- Just tell me why she was in Stormcage.
- She killed a man.

25:47.360 --> 25:50.399
A good man, a hero to many.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.239
- Who?
- You don't want to know, sir.

25:52.320 --> 25:53.799
You really don't.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.199
Who did she kill?

25:55.280 --> 25:57.679
Sir, the Angels are coming,
you have to leave me.

25:57.760 --> 26:00.079
You'll die.

26:00.200 --> 26:05.679
I will die in the knowledge that
my courage did not desert me at the end.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.879
For that, I thank God

26:07.960 --> 26:11.039
and bless the path
that takes you to safety.

26:15.200 --> 26:16.759
I wish I'd known you better.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.039
I think, sir,

26:19.120 --> 26:21.799
you know me at my best.

26:24.080 --> 26:25.119
Ready?

26:26.680 --> 26:28.839
Content.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.279
There's a teleport! If I can get it
to work, we can beam the others here.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.239
Where's Octavian?

26:43.320 --> 26:46.319
Octavian's dead. So is that teleport,
you're wasting your time.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.999
I'm going to need your communicator.

26:52.040 --> 26:55.279
Hello, are you there?

26:55.360 --> 26:57.599
Hello?

26:57.680 --> 27:02.079
- Hello?
- MARCO: I'm here, I'm fine.

27:02.160 --> 27:03.799
I'm quite close to it now.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.399
Then come back.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.199
Come back now, please.

27:07.280 --> 27:10.519
It's weird looking at it.
It feels really...

27:10.600 --> 27:12.439
(RADIO STATIC WHISTLES)

27:13.480 --> 27:16.119
Really what? Hello?

27:16.200 --> 27:18.439
Really what?

27:18.520 --> 27:22.199
Hello? Hello?!

27:22.280 --> 27:24.079
Hello?

27:25.640 --> 27:28.519
Please say you're there. Hello?
Hello!

27:30.800 --> 27:34.399
DOCTOR: Amy? Amy? Is that you?

27:34.520 --> 27:36.919
- Doctor?
- Where are you? Are the clerics with you?

27:37.000 --> 27:40.839
They've gone. There was a light
and they walked into the light.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.559
Doctor, they didn't even remember
each other.

27:42.640 --> 27:43.999
No. They wouldn't.

27:44.080 --> 27:46.319
- What is that light?
- Time running out.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.839
Amy, I'm sorry, I made a mistake,
I should never have left you there.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.519
Well, what do I do now?

27:50.600 --> 27:53.359
You come to us. Primary Flight Deck,
the other end of the forest.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.479
I can't see! I can't open my eyes.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.119
- Turn on the spot.
- Sorry, what?

27:57.200 --> 27:58.719
Just do it, turn on the spot.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.359
When the communicator sounds
like my screwdriver,

28:01.440 --> 28:03.799
that means you're facing the right way.
Follow the sound.

28:03.880 --> 28:04.959
(WHIRRING)

28:05.040 --> 28:08.839
(WHIRRING BECOMES HIGH-PITCHED)

28:11.640 --> 28:14.879
You have to start moving now.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.159
There's time energy
spilling out of that crack

28:16.240 --> 28:17.999
and you have to stay ahead of it.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.119
But the Angels, they're everywhere.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.559
I'm sorry, I really am,
but the Angels can only kill you.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.559
What does the time energy do?

28:24.640 --> 28:27.839
- Just keep moving!
- Tell me!

28:27.920 --> 28:29.919
If the time energy catches up with you,

28:30.000 --> 28:31.519
you'll never have been born.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.439
It will erase
every moment of your existence.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.599
You will never have lived at all.

28:38.640 --> 28:44.239
Now...keep your eyes shut...
and keep moving!

28:44.320 --> 28:47.159
- It's never going to work.
- (SHOUTS) What else have you got?

28:47.240 --> 28:48.759
River, tell me!

29:03.000 --> 29:05.399
(WHOOSHING, CLANGING)

29:05.480 --> 29:08.479
- What's that?
- The Angels running from the fire.

29:08.560 --> 29:10.559
They came here to feed on
the time energy,

29:10.640 --> 29:12.039
now it's going to feed on them.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.839
Amy, listen to me, I'm sending
a bit of software to your communicator.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.079
It's a proximity detector,

29:17.160 --> 29:19.199
it'll beep if there's something
in your way.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.399
You just manoeuvre
till the beeping stops.

29:21.480 --> 29:25.719
Because, Amy, this is important,
the forest is full of Angels.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.239
You're going to have to walk
like you can see.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.999
Well, what do you mean?

29:33.080 --> 29:34.719
Look, just keep moving.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.559
That time energy.
What's it going to do?

29:40.640 --> 29:42.479
Er, keep eating.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.919
- How do we stop it?
- Feed it.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.279
- Feed it what?
- A big complicated space-time event,

29:47.360 --> 29:49.799
- should shut it up for a while.
- Like what, for instance?

29:49.880 --> 29:54.239
(SHOUTS) Like me, for instance!

29:57.840 --> 29:59.039
(HIGH-PITCHED BEEPING)

30:00.960 --> 30:03.439
- What's that?
- It's a warning.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.319
There are Angels round you now.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.559
Amy, listen to me.
This is going to be hard, but I know...

30:16.640 --> 30:18.599
you can do it.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.439
The Angels are scared and running.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.799
And right now they're not
that interested in you.

30:22.880 --> 30:26.759
They'll assume you can see them,
and their instincts will kick in.

30:26.840 --> 30:31.199
All you've got to do is
walk like you can see.

30:31.280 --> 30:33.319
Just don't open your eyes.

30:34.880 --> 30:36.999
Walk like you can see.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.439
You're not moving.
You have to do this.

30:46.560 --> 30:47.559
Now.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.759
You have to do this!

30:51.840 --> 30:54.639
(COMMUNICATOR BEEPS REGULARLY)

30:59.040 --> 31:00.359
(BEEPING SPEEDS UP)

31:00.440 --> 31:01.879
(SHE GASPS)

31:01.960 --> 31:03.759
(BEEPING SLOWS DOWN)

31:17.480 --> 31:19.639
(BEEPING SPEEDS UP)

31:21.720 --> 31:23.199
(BEEPING SLOWS DOWN)

31:34.840 --> 31:36.319
Argh!

31:40.360 --> 31:42.159
Doctor!
I can't find the communicator!

31:44.640 --> 31:46.679
I dropped it! I can't find it, Doctor!

31:57.080 --> 31:58.759
Doctor...

31:58.840 --> 32:00.319
Doctor!

32:04.760 --> 32:06.599
Doctor...

32:23.480 --> 32:24.439
Don't open your eyes.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.919
You're on the Flight Deck,
the Doctor's here,

32:27.000 --> 32:29.919
I teleported you. See?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.199
Told you I could get it working.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.879
River Song, I could bloody kiss you.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.839
Ah, well, maybe when you're older.

32:36.920 --> 32:39.799
- (ALARM BLARES)
- What is that?

32:39.880 --> 32:43.159
The Angels are draining the last
of the ship's power. Which means...

32:43.240 --> 32:45.399
the shield's going to release!

33:00.440 --> 33:03.159
Angel Bob, I presume.

33:03.240 --> 33:06.719
ANGELBOB: The time field is coming.
It will destroy our reality.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.399
And look at you all, running away.
What can I do for you?

33:09.480 --> 33:10.959
There is a rupture in time.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.239
The Angels calculate
that if you throw yourself into it,

33:14.320 --> 33:16.199
it will close, and they will be saved.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.319
Yeah, yeah, could do,
could do that. But why?

33:18.400 --> 33:20.439
Your friends would also be saved.

33:20.520 --> 33:22.759
- Well, there is that.
- I've travelled in time.

33:22.840 --> 33:24.959
I'm a complicated space-time event too,
throw me in.

33:25.040 --> 33:25.999
Oh, be serious!

33:26.080 --> 33:28.039
Compared to me, these Angels are
more complicated than you,

33:28.120 --> 33:30.799
and it would take every one of them
to amount to me, so get a grip.

33:30.880 --> 33:33.639
- Doctor, I can't let you do this.
- No, seriously, get a grip.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.759
- You're not going to die here!
- No, I mean it.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.119
River, Amy, get a grip.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.279
Oh, you genius!

33:40.360 --> 33:43.999
Sir, the Angels need you
to sacrifice yourself now.

33:44.080 --> 33:47.599
Thing is, Bob, the Angels are draining
all the power from this ship,

33:47.680 --> 33:49.759
every last bit of it.
And you know what?

33:49.840 --> 33:51.719
I think they've forgotten
where they're standing.

33:51.800 --> 33:55.639
I think they've forgotten
the gravity of the situation.

33:55.720 --> 33:57.279
Or to put it another way, Angels...

33:57.360 --> 34:01.319
You hold on tight
and don't you let go for anything.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.159
Night-night.

34:47.480 --> 34:51.599
- Ah, bruised everywhere.
- Me too.

34:51.680 --> 34:54.239
You didn't have to climb out
with your eyes shut.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.719
Neither did you, I kept saying.

34:56.800 --> 35:00.039
The Angels all fell
into the time field,

35:00.120 --> 35:03.319
the Angel in your memory
never existed.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.359
It can't harm you now.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.399
Then why do I remember it at all?

35:07.480 --> 35:10.319
Those guys on the ship
didn't remember each other.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.199
You're a time traveller now, Amy.

35:13.280 --> 35:16.079
Changes the way you see the universe.

35:16.160 --> 35:18.799
For ever. Good, isn't it?

35:21.120 --> 35:22.599
And the crack.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.359
Is that gone too?

35:26.280 --> 35:27.719
Yeah.

35:27.800 --> 35:31.399
For now.
But the explosion that caused it

35:31.480 --> 35:33.199
is still happening...

35:36.400 --> 35:38.279
...somewhere out there.

35:38.360 --> 35:40.679
Somewhere in time.

35:58.720 --> 36:02.639
You, me...handcuffs.

36:04.720 --> 36:06.639
Must it always end this way?

36:08.840 --> 36:11.559
What now?

36:11.640 --> 36:16.159
The prison ship's in orbit,
they'll beam me up any second.

36:16.240 --> 36:20.079
I might have done enough
to earn a pardon this time. We'll see.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.239
Octavian said you killed a man.

36:25.800 --> 36:28.159
Yes, I did.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.199
A good man.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.039
A very good man.

36:35.120 --> 36:37.239
The best man I've ever known.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.279
Who?

36:42.360 --> 36:46.119
It's a long story, Doctor.
Can't be told, it has to be lived.

36:46.200 --> 36:49.519
No sneak previews.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.319
Well, except for this one.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.919
You'll see me again quite soon,

36:55.000 --> 36:58.719
when the Pandorica opens.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.679
The Pandorica. Ha!

37:05.520 --> 37:07.199
(WHISPERS) That's a fairy tale.

37:07.280 --> 37:09.719
Oh, Doctor!

37:09.800 --> 37:11.839
Aren't we all?

37:12.920 --> 37:15.399
- I'll see you there.
- I look forward to it.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.159
I remember it well.

37:20.560 --> 37:23.119
Bye, River.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.319
See you, Amy.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.399
(BEEPING)

37:25.480 --> 37:27.439
Oh! I think that's my ride.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.079
Can I trust you, River Song?

37:29.160 --> 37:31.919
If you like.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.959
But where's the fun in that?

37:54.680 --> 37:56.759
What are you thinking?

37:56.840 --> 37:58.519
Time can be rewritten.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.679
I want to go home.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.199
OK.

38:20.880 --> 38:21.839
No, not like that!

38:21.920 --> 38:26.399
I just... I just want
to show you something.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.399
You're running from River.

38:29.480 --> 38:30.959
I'm running too.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.519
(OWL HOOTS)

38:44.720 --> 38:46.679
- Well!
- Yeah!

38:46.760 --> 38:48.479
- Blimey!
- I know.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.119
This is the same night we left, yeah?

38:50.200 --> 38:53.199
We've been gone five minutes.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.239
I'm getting married in the morning.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.039
Why did you leave it here?

39:01.160 --> 39:04.319
Why did I leave my engagement ring off
when I ran away with a strange man

39:04.400 --> 39:05.999
- the night before my wedding?
- Yeah.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.919
You really are an alien, aren't you?

39:09.000 --> 39:11.119
- Who's the lucky fella?
- You met him.

39:11.200 --> 39:14.999
Ah, the good-looking one,
or the other one?

39:15.080 --> 39:16.799
The other one.

39:16.880 --> 39:19.279
- Well, he was good too.
- Thanks.

39:21.040 --> 39:24.239
So, do you comfort a lot of people
on the night before their wedding?

39:24.320 --> 39:25.799
Why would you need comforting?

39:25.840 --> 39:31.159
I nearly died. I was alone, in the dark,
and I nearly died. And it made me think...

39:31.240 --> 39:34.079
Well, yes, natural. I think sometimes...
Well, lots of times...

39:34.160 --> 39:37.399
...about what I want. About who I want.

39:37.480 --> 39:41.039
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.559
No.

39:44.640 --> 39:48.759
- About who...I want.
- Oh, right, yeah.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.639
No, still not getting it.

39:54.760 --> 39:58.679
Doctor, in a word, in one very simple word
even you can understand...

39:58.760 --> 40:00.999
Uh...! You're getting married
in the morning!

40:01.080 --> 40:04.079
The morning's a long time away.
What are we going to do about that?

40:04.160 --> 40:08.119
Amy, listen to me. I'm 907 years old.
Do you understand what that means?

40:08.200 --> 40:10.319
- It's been a while?
- No, no, no!

40:10.400 --> 40:13.439
I'm 907, and look at me.
I don't get older, I just change.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.839
You get older, I don't,
and this can't ever work.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.039
Oh, you are sweet, Doctor.

40:18.120 --> 40:21.599
But I really wasn't suggesting
anything quite so...long term.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.199
But you're human! You're Amy!

40:27.280 --> 40:30.039
You're getting married
in the morning! In the morning.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.799
Doctor?

40:31.880 --> 40:36.279
It's you. It's all about you -
everything, it's about you.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.559
Hold that thought!

40:40.440 --> 40:46.039
Amy Pond... Mad, impossible Amy Pond.
I don't know why, I have no idea,

40:46.120 --> 40:49.479
but quite possibly the single
most important thing in the history

40:49.560 --> 40:52.399
of the universe is that I get you
sorted out right now.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.679
That's what I've been
trying to tell you!

40:54.760 --> 40:56.679
Come on!

40:59.320 --> 41:01.359
Doctor!

41:03.600 --> 41:07.039
RIVER: And for those of us who can't read
the base code of the universe?

41:07.120 --> 41:08.959
DOCTOR: Amy's time!
