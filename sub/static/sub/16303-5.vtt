00:13.181 --> 00:21.122
[silence]

00:21.122 --> 00:22.756
- Oh, what's up, guys?

00:22.756 --> 00:24.425
- Hello, Sam.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.794
- Hi.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.363
- You're looking pretty fresh,
Sam.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.766
- HANNAH: Are you...

00:32.766 --> 00:35.236
wearing cologne?

00:35.236 --> 00:36.570
- They gave me a little...

00:36.570 --> 00:40.208
bag with some sample packs
of different products.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.109
- Oh.

00:41.109 --> 00:41.842
That's nice.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.311
- Yeah.

00:44.145 --> 00:44.945
- Just different small-

00:44.945 --> 00:46.180
- CONNOR: Stop talking.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.181
- Ok.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.852
- [heavy sigh]

00:51.852 --> 00:53.821
- They got this face cream...

00:55.223 --> 00:55.856
feels...

00:55.856 --> 00:57.024
feels good.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.126
It feels like it's
really moisturizing-

00:58.126 --> 01:00.728
- What the fuck did
you tell them?

01:01.729 --> 01:03.164
- I...

01:04.265 --> 01:04.932
- You know I don't
like talking to you.

01:04.932 --> 01:05.933
- We know, sir.

01:05.933 --> 01:06.800
- Ok, then why am
I talking to you?

01:06.800 --> 01:08.702
- Sir, there's a situation, and-

01:08.702 --> 01:09.803
- Stop, stop. Situation.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.305
I don't want to know
about situations.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.072
- Sir, with all due respect,
putting your head in the sand

01:12.072 --> 01:14.242
is not going to stop-

01:14.242 --> 01:15.543
- Head in the sand?

01:15.543 --> 01:17.911
Mullins, you need to get
your head out of your ass!

01:17.911 --> 01:19.247
You do not exist.

01:19.247 --> 01:22.850
Your Jekyll and Hyde science
facility does not exist.

01:22.850 --> 01:26.654
So for fuck's sake, make sure
your situation doesn't exist.

01:26.654 --> 01:27.521
- [beep]

01:29.723 --> 01:31.492
- You ready to let me kick
things up a notch?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.197
- Make the call.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.200
- So, let me get
this straight.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.802
They gave you a bath and
cologne, but all they keep

01:41.802 --> 01:44.272
giving me is shit burgers?

01:44.272 --> 01:45.373
- You got shit burgers too?

01:45.373 --> 01:47.375
- We're all just getting
shit burgers?

01:47.375 --> 01:50.244
There some weird shit cook
doing the iron chef

01:50.244 --> 01:51.412
doo doo challenge?

01:51.412 --> 01:52.913
- What did you tell them, Sam?

01:52.913 --> 01:54.047
- Nothing. Okay?

01:54.047 --> 01:55.283
Don't you see what's
happening here?

01:55.283 --> 01:56.150
They're trying to turn us
against each other.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.486
I didn't give them anything.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.222
- Sam gave us the address
to your warehouse.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.423
- I fucking knew it, Sam!

02:02.423 --> 02:03.791
- You said you wouldn't tell.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.259
- Well, that's before we found
13 missing people barely

02:05.259 --> 02:08.796
clinging onto life in that
freakshow crack den of yours.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.331
- Well.. at least they're alive.

02:10.331 --> 02:12.266
- Shut up!

02:12.266 --> 02:13.401
Now, you've been lying to us.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.668
- Just come clean.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.270
We don't want to hear any
more stories about Sam

02:16.270 --> 02:17.238
shitting his pants.

02:17.238 --> 02:18.105
- Never happened.

02:18.105 --> 02:18.972
- Or Berkman's missing dick.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.174
- I told you that in confidence.

02:20.174 --> 02:24.212
- We want to know how in
the fuck you created

02:24.212 --> 02:26.247
that god damned hole.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.249
- Okay.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.517
Here's the thing.

02:29.517 --> 02:32.686
And I know this isn't
what you want to hear.

02:32.686 --> 02:35.289
But we honestly don't know.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.557
- Bull shit.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.293
- You have 30 minutes to tell us
about the rift.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.894
It's your last chance.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.231
- What happens after 30 minutes?

02:43.231 --> 02:45.233
- Agent Hobbs has just
put a call in to our

02:45.233 --> 02:48.001
best interrogator.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.770
- You see, he's...

02:49.770 --> 02:50.871
broke the Taliban.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.273
Al-Qaeda.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.742
ISIS...

02:54.742 --> 02:57.345
And he will break you if
you don't start spilling.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.413
Clock's ticking.

02:59.713 --> 03:00.748
Tick.

03:00.748 --> 03:01.882
Tock.

03:01.882 --> 03:03.351
Tick.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.117
Tock.

- MULLINS: So.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.316
Party of the century.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.051
What happened?

04:11.051 --> 04:12.553
- Look.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.988
We tried to invite you guys,
we really did, but the e-vite

04:14.988 --> 04:16.857
must have gotten caught
in your spam folder, and-

04:16.857 --> 04:19.092
- [bang]

04:19.092 --> 04:22.596
- Stop antagonizing them.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.832
- I don't know how to
stop anything.

04:24.832 --> 04:25.899
It's actually a problem.

04:25.899 --> 04:27.100
- Listen to your girlfriend,
Berkman.

04:27.100 --> 04:27.968
- I'm not his girlfriend.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.069
- She's not his girlfriend.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.404
- Shut up!

04:30.404 --> 04:31.238
Just shut up!

04:31.238 --> 04:33.040
Want to know what I think?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.975
I think you guys know
exactly what's going on.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.344
I think you're playing dumb.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.946
I think you know how the rift
happened, and I think it

04:38.946 --> 04:41.549
all comes back to this party.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.083
Now, you've got 25 minutes.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.354
And if you don't tell me about
this hole and about the party,

04:46.354 --> 04:48.856
and how it all connects...

04:48.856 --> 04:51.359
then I swear to God,
you will be praying.

04:51.359 --> 04:52.460
Praying.

04:52.460 --> 04:56.564
For shit burgers and
broken noses.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.666
- So who wants to dance first?

05:03.103 --> 05:06.474
- I guess for me, it started
just a few days

05:06.474 --> 05:08.442
before my birthday.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.613
- Unreal, dudes.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.147
That was like a movie.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.450
A really good movie
that I was in!

05:16.450 --> 05:18.218
- I'm super into mash-ups
right now, so I was trying

05:18.218 --> 05:21.589
to bring you Citizen Kane
with Boondock Saints .

05:21.589 --> 05:23.123
- We're so happy you're
satisfied.

05:23.123 --> 05:26.093
- Yeah, do you think I could get
in a few buddies for next week?

05:26.093 --> 05:27.495
- Yeah, we're happy to schedule
your friends some time.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.162
Hey, Sam, get the calendar out.

05:29.162 --> 05:29.930
- Uh, no.

05:29.930 --> 05:30.831
I mean like all together.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.633
- Uh, we don't do that, so...

05:32.633 --> 05:34.635
- What he means...

05:34.635 --> 05:37.037
is we don't do Discover.

05:37.037 --> 05:37.771
Is that a...

05:37.771 --> 05:38.972
oh, that's a MasterCard.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.508
Great!

05:40.508 --> 05:43.911
So, what were you saying about
getting your friends in here?

05:43.911 --> 05:45.178
- Yeah, I have a lot of
buddies who'd pay

05:45.178 --> 05:48.482
top dollar to get in here
all at the same time.

05:48.482 --> 05:51.018
- All at the same time.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.353
- Yeah, it's like next
level party.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.889
- Of course.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.426
Uh, what about next Saturday?

05:58.426 --> 05:59.493
- Yeah!

05:59.493 --> 06:01.028
I think I could
make that work.

06:01.028 --> 06:04.197
- Um, but because of the extra
neural capacitors and shit...

06:04.197 --> 06:06.434
I don't want to
bore you with it.

06:06.434 --> 06:08.368
We're gonna have to charge
a little bit extra.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.336
- Yeah, it is.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.439
It's like $2,500 extra.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.039
Per person.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.140
- Yeah, man.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.509
- My gosh, that's like
10k for a party.

06:15.509 --> 06:19.580
- Yeah, but it's like next level
of partying, so...

06:19.580 --> 06:21.014
- Well, yeah.

06:21.014 --> 06:23.216
I mean, uh, my buddy Devon,
he's like a trust fund kid

06:23.216 --> 06:25.453
and totally rich, dude.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.687
- Yeah.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.187
- Uh, so yeah, I'll see you
next Saturday!

06:27.187 --> 06:28.188
- Mhm.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.457
- Yeah?

06:29.457 --> 06:30.624
- Do you think you can
bring some girls too?

06:30.624 --> 06:32.526
Devon will pay for
their entrance fee.

06:32.526 --> 06:33.694
He has very low self esteem.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.528
- Yeah.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.564
I know, um, so many girls.

06:36.564 --> 06:37.465
So...

06:37.465 --> 06:38.466
- Okay!

06:38.466 --> 06:39.567
Fantastic!

06:39.567 --> 06:40.200
- BERKMAN: Great.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.368
- So, Sam!

06:41.368 --> 06:42.703
Get him on the calendar
for Saturday!

06:42.703 --> 06:43.604
- Yeah!

06:43.604 --> 06:45.172
- Hop to it!

06:45.172 --> 06:47.074
Todd, I will see you out.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.576
- Oh, it's Taj.

06:48.576 --> 06:49.309
The D's are silent.

06:49.309 --> 06:50.711
- HANNAH: I'm sorry.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.547
How culturally insensitive.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.483
- Oh my god!

06:55.483 --> 06:56.216
- BERKMAN: Okay.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.518
That was great.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.251
- Unbelievable!

06:58.251 --> 06:59.620
- You were amazing.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.821
- HANNAH: How'd you do that?

07:00.821 --> 07:02.523
- BERMAN: I was just
following your lead.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.724
- HANNAH: I just said the 2,500.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.493
I don't even know how
I came up with it.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.662
- Your birthday?!

07:08.662 --> 07:09.897
Sam, you were turning 28.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.533
I can't think of a less
consequential age.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.967
- More inconsequential.

07:13.967 --> 07:14.835
- What?

07:14.835 --> 07:16.604
- Not more inconsequential.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.404
That's redundant.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.271
- More inconsequential.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.172
Yeah, more inconsequential.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.073
- Less consequential is right.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.209
- No one says inconsequential.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.176
- What I said was grammatically
correct.

07:23.176 --> 07:23.944
- Twenty-eight is
inconsequential?

07:23.944 --> 07:24.978
- In my opinion, yes.

07:24.978 --> 07:25.546
- I'm gonna learn guitar
this year.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.247
- Shut up!

07:27.247 --> 07:28.115
Just shut up!

07:28.115 --> 07:29.282
Shut up.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.520
Back to the story!

07:32.520 --> 07:34.087
- French kiss.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.756
From both sides of their head.

07:35.756 --> 07:38.692
- And, and confetti,
confetti spurts out.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.993
- Okay, guys?

07:39.993 --> 07:41.228
It all sounds really cool,
but I think you might be

07:41.228 --> 07:43.597
forgetting something else
that's already happening

07:43.597 --> 07:44.565
on that day?

07:44.565 --> 07:45.298
- Like what?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.500
- Yeah.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.034
Nothing else special
happens on Saturday.

07:47.034 --> 07:47.768
- Okay.

07:47.768 --> 07:48.268
You're screwing with me.

07:48.268 --> 07:48.936
I get it.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.771
Okay? You know.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.673
- Know what, Sam?

07:53.140 --> 07:54.642
- Hey.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.277
- Ah, the Pillsbury Doughbaby
is home a little early, huh?

07:57.277 --> 07:59.613
- Yeah, my fencing instructor
went back to rehab.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.615
What is this?

08:01.615 --> 08:02.516
- This.

08:02.516 --> 08:05.218
Is the future of our company.

08:05.218 --> 08:08.722
- We have a client who wants
to have a party next Saturday.

08:08.722 --> 08:13.193
- And he would like to hook up
all of his friends at once.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.294
- [laughing] No.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.563
No, no, no, no.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.964
Absolutely not.

08:16.964 --> 08:20.100
Guys, the Brain Frame is maxed
out at three participants

08:20.100 --> 08:21.234
plus one host.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.737
- He will pay us $2,500
per person.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.706
- And he's got six people
already lined up, ready to go.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.306
- Mmm.

08:26.306 --> 08:26.907
No, no, no.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.241
Can't do it.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.244
The science says it cannot
be done, so gotta cancel.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.680
Do something else that night.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.647
- Well, maybe it...

08:33.647 --> 08:35.048
it could work.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.316
- What?

08:36.316 --> 08:39.186
- If we could find a host
with a neural capacity

08:39.186 --> 08:41.121
capable of handling such
an increased load...

08:41.121 --> 08:42.222
- Connor, just cut the bullshit.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.125
- We would need to find
someone...

08:45.125 --> 08:48.629
with a brain that was, for
lack of a better word, empty.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.697
- Empty.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.231
- Vacuous. Void. Vacant.
No thought.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.734
- Well, I do have a great uncle
who's in a vegetative state.

08:53.734 --> 08:54.668
- No, no, no.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.969
That won't work.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.805
We need to find someone
with a healthy brain.

08:57.805 --> 08:58.639
Uh, innocent.

08:58.639 --> 08:59.506
Child-like.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.308
- I've got an 11-year-old niece.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.610
But, she's kind of a dick.

09:02.610 --> 09:03.711
- Alright, no.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.112
I'm actually way
ahead of you on this.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.714
I didn't want to say anything
before, but I've had this

09:06.714 --> 09:07.848
idea for a while now.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.382
- Wow.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.653
So you're gonna steal my ide-
Our idea right in front of us.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.755
- It's not stealing, Berkman.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.123
Okay?

09:16.123 --> 09:18.391
This is just the next logical
step in this technology.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.393
Before we go global.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.729
- (in unison) Global.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.632
- And I've been prepping a
subject just for this

09:24.632 --> 09:25.332
in earnest.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.133
- What?

09:26.133 --> 09:27.100
Who?

09:27.100 --> 09:27.635
- [door opening]

09:27.635 --> 09:29.302
- Guys?

09:29.302 --> 09:31.972
I can't find Mr. Peanuts...

09:34.775 --> 09:38.712
- Just kidding, he's right
here in my backpack!

09:38.712 --> 09:40.814
For a double dose of cuteness.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.616
Me and him.

09:43.250 --> 09:43.984
You should have seen
your guys' faces.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.653
I Burn Noticed you.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.020
- Larry.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.624
It's time.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.428
- Wait, for what?

09:55.428 --> 09:56.329
- For...

09:56.329 --> 09:58.198
For the thing we talked about.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.768
- Oh yeah.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.372
It's time.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.810
- That's why you kept
Larry around.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.244
- Sam made sense.

10:11.244 --> 10:14.314
Because of his access to money
and his father's clout.

10:14.314 --> 10:16.684
Berkman and Hannah had
somewhat raw skill sets

10:16.684 --> 10:18.886
and a lack of a moral center,
but Larry...

10:18.886 --> 10:20.754
- Was plastic.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.858
Sure, All of my brilliant ideas
that he touched turned to shit,

10:24.858 --> 10:27.795
but his brain was...

10:27.795 --> 10:28.796
malleable.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.331
Like all weak-minded people,
all he ever wanted

10:31.331 --> 10:32.900
was to be included.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.134
- Okay, guys.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.770
We've only got five days,
so we need to completely

10:36.770 --> 10:37.971
cleanse Larry's brain palate.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.707
- Let me just say, guys,
I feel truly honored

10:39.707 --> 10:40.808
to be a part of-

10:40.808 --> 10:41.775
- Shut the fuck up, Larry.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.110
- You got it.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.712
- Every one of you has important
roles to play here.

10:44.712 --> 10:45.979
Berkman.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.848
I need you upping his brain's
fantasy quotient.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.650
I want to give
people a good show.

10:54.922 --> 10:58.792
- [pleasured moaning from tv]

10:58.792 --> 11:00.894
- Keeping in mind, your version
of fantasy is very

11:00.894 --> 11:02.796
different than his.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.466
- [children voices on tv]

11:06.466 --> 11:08.401
- Oh my god, a baby elephant!

11:09.737 --> 11:11.805
- Hannah, I need you to do an
extensive psych eval.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.206
I need to find out what
his fears, triggers,

11:13.206 --> 11:14.908
and darkest secrets might be.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.810
- Puppy in a windmill.

11:17.745 --> 11:19.747
Easy, puppy wearing a silly hat.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.049
Oh, my mom didn't love me.

11:22.816 --> 11:23.917
- What?

11:23.917 --> 11:25.285
- A puppy under a waterfall!

11:25.285 --> 11:26.854
Look at him gettin' all wet!

11:26.854 --> 11:27.921
- That is a...

11:27.921 --> 11:29.122
That's a puppy under
a waterfall.

11:29.122 --> 11:29.957
- I'll be studying the
brainwave readouts

11:29.957 --> 11:32.425
after each and every test.

11:32.425 --> 11:33.293
But remember.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.863
You can't increase the load.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.865
We're pushing the boundaries
far enough as is.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.901
So don't tell anyone
else about this.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.235
- Of course.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.772
- I'm talking like you can do
anything you want.

11:44.772 --> 11:46.239
Like what is your greatest,
like, craziest desire?

11:46.239 --> 11:48.375
- I just always thought about,
like a spider, but they'd-

11:48.375 --> 11:49.509
he'd be grabbing my
boobs from behind.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.911
- Oh my- Oh my god!

11:50.911 --> 11:52.512
- Imagine your dick is so big,
you can do cocaine off

11:52.512 --> 11:53.847
the tip of your own dick.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.015
You like cocaine?

11:58.786 --> 12:13.566
- [dreamy music]

12:13.566 --> 12:15.903
- Wait, what about me?

12:16.870 --> 12:17.704
- You are...

12:17.704 --> 12:19.940
going to be the navigator.

12:19.940 --> 12:20.573
- What?

12:20.573 --> 12:21.708
- Well, um...

12:21.708 --> 12:23.176
it's a very important
job, you know?

12:23.176 --> 12:25.478
Larry can't do it, so I need
someone else I can trust...

12:25.478 --> 12:26.847
- So...

12:26.847 --> 12:28.315
so you're telling me I'm gonna
be out here watching the

12:28.315 --> 12:32.352
computers while you guys are
in there partying with uh...

12:32.352 --> 12:34.421
unicorns and, and rainbows...

12:34.421 --> 12:35.088
- No.

12:35.088 --> 12:35.789
No, no, no, no.

12:35.789 --> 12:36.924
Nothing like that.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.926
You have critical things
to do out here.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.460
You have to, um...

12:40.460 --> 12:41.895
You have to monitor
our theta waves.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.363
You have to check our vitals.

12:43.363 --> 12:44.898
Um...

12:44.898 --> 12:46.566
I don't know.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.969
Watching a party can
be fun too, right?

12:48.969 --> 12:51.905
- But...

12:51.905 --> 12:54.842
But it was my birthday.

12:54.842 --> 12:57.610
You know, they threw the
party of the century.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.013
And they didn't
even invite me.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.314
- Wait, Sam.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.582
Hey.

13:02.582 --> 13:03.516
Come on.

13:03.516 --> 13:04.651
Don't leave.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.519
We'll, we'll do something
fun on Sunday.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.320
- No, Hannah.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.922
It's not about the day.

13:08.922 --> 13:09.957
Okay?

13:09.957 --> 13:10.590
Don't you see?

13:10.590 --> 13:12.559
I, I am...

13:12.559 --> 13:13.626
I'm useless here.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.462
You guys would be
better without me.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.396
- That's not true.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.530
Don't say that.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.632
- I'm sick of doing all
the shitty work.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.834
Okay?

13:20.834 --> 13:22.069
Maybe you found your
life's purpose here,

13:22.069 --> 13:24.905
and that's fantastic for you,
but like...

13:24.905 --> 13:28.408
this is, it's just a
big reminder of what

13:28.408 --> 13:30.643
I will never have.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.245
- Which is...

13:37.550 --> 13:38.651
- You.

13:38.651 --> 13:43.924
- [solemn music]

13:43.924 --> 13:45.358
- I...

13:45.358 --> 13:54.367
- [solemn music]

13:54.367 --> 14:03.376
[solemn music]

14:03.376 --> 14:11.118
[solemn music]

14:11.118 --> 14:13.686
- [telephone ringing]

14:13.686 --> 14:15.488
- M.W. Energy, where the
world's energy is sold.

14:15.488 --> 14:16.523
How may I help you?

14:16.523 --> 14:17.624
- Hi. Um...

14:17.624 --> 14:19.960
May I speak to Montgomery,
please?

14:19.960 --> 14:22.029
- I'm sorry, he's in a very
important meeting right now.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.396
May I ask who's calling?

14:23.396 --> 14:23.897
- It's Sam.

14:23.897 --> 14:24.998
- Sam.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.166
Sam, Sam, Sam.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.601
Uh, I'm sorry, I don't
see a Sam here.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.569
- It's his son.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.437
Sam.

14:30.437 --> 14:31.471
- Oh!

14:31.471 --> 14:32.605
His son.

14:32.605 --> 14:33.941
Of course.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.608
One moment please.

14:37.044 --> 14:40.013
- So I say, "Mr. Prime Minister,
your mistress may be gorgeous,

14:40.013 --> 14:42.049
but your economy is
ugly as fuck."

14:42.049 --> 14:42.950
- [laughter]

14:42.950 --> 14:44.617
- That's a great story, Monty.

14:44.617 --> 14:45.685
- I know, that's why I told it.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.520
- [laughter]

14:47.520 --> 14:48.755
- Phone call, Mr. Wittington.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.991
- Call me "Mister" again,
and I'll break your nose

14:50.991 --> 14:51.724
with my Nobel prize.

14:51.724 --> 14:52.559
- Pardon?

14:52.559 --> 14:55.262
- I'm a doctor, fuck face.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.367
- Montgomery here.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.735
- Dr. Wittington, I have Sam
on the line for you.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.071
- Melinda's divorce lawyer?

15:04.071 --> 15:06.106
I already told that prick if
he wants another dollar,

15:06.106 --> 15:08.475
he can find it buried
up Satan's ass.

15:08.475 --> 15:09.642
- No.

15:09.642 --> 15:11.144
Sam Wittington.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.479
Your son.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.813
- Samuel?

15:13.813 --> 15:16.016
We don't have a call
scheduled for today, do we?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.985
- No, sir.

15:17.985 --> 15:18.851
- Okay, B.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.287
We knew this day would come.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.990
Email me that script of
culturally appropriate things

15:22.990 --> 15:25.092
to say when your son
comes out of the closet.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.593
I'm about to be
Secretary of Energy.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.628
I can't be trapped
in the dark ages.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.763
- I think he just wants
to speak to his father.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.932
- Okay, put him through.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.502
- Samuel.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.103
What is it?

15:36.103 --> 15:37.204
- Hey, dad.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.705
Uh...

15:38.705 --> 15:41.108
Just turned midnight.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.609
- Terrific.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.511
- It just turned- it just
turned midnight.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.179
It's April 9th now.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.280
- Sam.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.549
I'm in New Zealand at an
energy summit.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.718
It's been April 9th
for 19 hours.

15:51.718 --> 15:54.254
Did you call to discuss the
time zones?

15:54.754 --> 15:55.989
- No, sir.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.725
- Did you have a pressing
matter of business?

16:00.527 --> 16:01.794
- No, sir, I guess not.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.030
- Did you kill a prostitute?

16:03.030 --> 16:04.564
- What? No.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.033
- I'm picking up hesitation,
Sam.

16:06.033 --> 16:07.134
- Dad, it's a...

16:07.134 --> 16:08.568
weird question.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.303
- Okay...

16:11.271 --> 16:11.871
Beatrice?

16:11.871 --> 16:13.340
- Yes, sir?

16:13.340 --> 16:14.741
- Email Roger the notes from
this call and set up another

16:14.741 --> 16:17.210
call between Sam and myself in
three weeks so we discuss

16:17.210 --> 16:18.045
this matter further.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.612
- Will do, Dr. Wittington.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.648
- Samuel, I've gotta go.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.149
- Yeah.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.150
Okay.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.217
Bye.

16:24.684 --> 16:25.685
- Okay, Sam.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.154
What's your avail
like on the 24th?

16:27.154 --> 16:28.521
I see I have a...

16:28.521 --> 16:33.060
12:15, a 3:45, a 6 o'clock...

16:33.060 --> 16:33.793
an 8 o'clock.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.228
- Fuck off.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.434
- [exhales sharply]

16:45.238 --> 16:47.140
- [dialing]

16:47.840 --> 16:48.741
- John.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.177
It's M.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.778
I want you to put
a tail of Samuel.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.246
I want to know
what he's up to.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.147
No, no.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.148
Not the lawyer.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.783
My son.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.451
We already have a
tail on the lawyer.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.258
