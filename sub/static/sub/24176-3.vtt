01:01.019 --> 01:03.602
April 23rd

01:11.655 --> 01:13.646
ls this really necessary?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.441
Regulations, sir.

01:26.545 --> 01:29.253
So you <i>did</i> come for me that night.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.713
That's what you said.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.708
Was it all part of a plan?

01:34.928 --> 01:38.262
I can't talk to you,
your father is under investigation.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.090
You didn't know
who my father was before!

01:44.229 --> 01:45.890
Fuck off.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.408
<i>There's a new message.</i>

02:01.121 --> 02:04.455
<i>Veronica,
I'm Davide Minnella, from the Rai.</i>

02:04.541 --> 02:07.454
<i>It's no use beating around the bush,
I have bad news.</i>

02:07.502 --> 02:10.789
<i>The affair's fallen through,
no "Domenica In".</i>

02:10.881 --> 02:14.545
<i>You'll be in the next round,
life's a circle!</i>

02:19.222 --> 02:21.634
We have to stay united, compact.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.093
Don't be bought, don't accept gifts,

02:25.312 --> 02:27.770
remember, we're the Northern League.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.306
The north has nothing
to do with Rome!

02:30.651 --> 02:32.858
Let's take Rome!

02:35.614 --> 02:38.732
Settle down please,
there are other people.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.693
What's that accent?

02:42.162 --> 02:43.652
"Other people!"

02:47.417 --> 02:49.875
Rome's a bandit,
the League will never stand it!

03:41.430 --> 03:43.046
Hello.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.269
At ease, at ease...

03:52.357 --> 03:54.348
It never passes, I know!

03:56.862 --> 03:59.479
Sorry, you can't come in like that.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.609
I got elected too.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.070
A jacket is mandatory.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.578
Isn't there an extra jacket for him?

04:07.831 --> 04:10.072
- Of course.
- Thank you.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.270
The sessions are only:

04:39.237 --> 04:41.353
Tuesday afternoons,

04:41.573 --> 04:43.780
Wednesdays all day
and Thursday mornings.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.778
They work their <i>asses</i> off here!

04:47.788 --> 04:50.371
Formentini looks angry,
what's wrong?

04:50.540 --> 04:53.908
He says he was a partisan
and won't sit next to Fascists.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.959
Hi, Umberto.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.216
Hot damn!

05:15.941 --> 05:17.978
First day of school.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.727
- What is it?
- The regulations.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.735
- We have to study this stuff?
- No!

05:26.159 --> 05:29.948
You don't learn politics in books,
but on the field!

05:31.581 --> 05:33.413
Thank God!

05:40.924 --> 05:44.292
- <i>I've been calling</i> all <i>morning.</i>
- <i>Has something happened to Viola ?</i>

05:44.427 --> 05:46.634
No, she's fine. Put Fabrizio on.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.005
<i>He's had a stroke.</i>

05:49.558 --> 05:51.140
What?

05:51.351 --> 05:54.434
<i>He can't talk,
we don't know if there's damage.</i>

05:54.604 --> 05:56.811
<i>I'm going back to the hospital, bye.</i>

05:58.066 --> 05:59.648
You made it!

06:02.737 --> 06:05.320
Do you realize what's going on here?

06:06.199 --> 06:09.408
Till today, investigations stopped
here, the system was closed.

06:10.161 --> 06:13.279
Whoever got caught stayed quiet
and paid for everyone.

06:13.456 --> 06:16.494
Today the system's collapsed,
because the industrialists,

06:16.585 --> 06:19.168
maybe also thanks to us,
have started talking.

06:19.254 --> 06:22.212
- Not Mainaghi.
- He stays in jail, too bad for him.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.966
We're going beyond Mario Chiesa
and the Pio Albergo Trivulzio,

06:26.094 --> 06:29.962
this is about tens of contracts
and Milan's biggest public agencies.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.177
Welcome to "Bribesville".

06:32.392 --> 06:34.679
This gentleman,
for those who don't know,

06:34.769 --> 06:38.353
is the magistrate who investigated
on the P2 and the Ambrosoli murder.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.098
Gentlemen, Gherardo Colombo,

06:41.192 --> 06:44.184
<i>as</i> of today he'll work with us
on the Mani Pulite investigation.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.356
Welcome.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.984
Vacations are over,
if you're not for it,

06:48.116 --> 06:49.652
there's the door.

06:49.826 --> 06:53.285
We're making history here,
we need men with balls.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.912
Gentlemen... rock and roll!

07:43.004 --> 07:45.871
And the subway?
Kickbacks for the underground?

07:48.551 --> 07:50.133
I paid in cash.

07:50.303 --> 07:54.092
- But I don't like the word kickback.
- What would you prefer?

07:54.933 --> 07:57.140
Voluntary dation
by the industrialists.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.016
A bribe.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.020
THE MILAN OF KICKBACKS
TREMBLES...

08:02.774 --> 08:05.607
THIEVES OUT OF PARLIAMENT

08:05.694 --> 08:07.184
Thieves, thieves!

08:07.278 --> 08:08.359
MAY 12th

08:11.366 --> 08:13.482
Thieves, thieves!

08:16.705 --> 08:18.366
Order, colleagues!

08:21.042 --> 08:22.578
Piazzale Loreto!

08:22.794 --> 08:23.875
How dare you!

08:24.129 --> 08:27.042
Di Pietro, Di Pietro!

08:29.300 --> 08:32.292
How many people live in Italy?
50 million?

08:33.096 --> 08:34.881
60, why?

08:35.097 --> 08:37.304
None of them have a job like ours!

08:37.517 --> 08:38.847
You're right!

08:40.145 --> 08:41.977
Di Pietro!

09:03.334 --> 09:05.325
This place scares me.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.422
You look tired, and older.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.254
Thank you...

09:14.179 --> 09:17.388
You sure know how to comfort a guy.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.179
It must be a family trait.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.973
What's that mean?

09:24.147 --> 09:26.388
Your sister was rough on me.

09:26.691 --> 09:29.399
Didn't you read her article?

09:32.405 --> 09:35.318
I'm sorry for your contract,
I know how you feel.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.609
Don't worry, it will all work out.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.029
Stay calm.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.242
Is that why you had me come?

09:47.253 --> 09:49.335
To tell me to stay calm?

09:49.589 --> 09:52.001
You have to leave the house,
for a while.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.212
It's in my name,

09:55.553 --> 09:58.671
the magistrates are looking
for my properties.

09:58.890 --> 10:02.178
If they find the house,
with you inside...

10:04.729 --> 10:07.016
it would be unpleasant
for everyone, right?

10:09.067 --> 10:11.308
It's just to be cautious!

10:11.861 --> 10:15.070
I've reserved a suite for you
at the Principe di Savoia.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.113
The Principe di Savoia?

10:17.325 --> 10:20.659
- Remember you met me there?
- So?

10:20.870 --> 10:23.111
You're saying
I go back to being a whore?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.447
Don't take it like that...

10:26.793 --> 10:28.784
I thought it was
the easiest solution.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.370
Want one even easier?

10:33.424 --> 10:35.256
I'll take care of myself.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.890
<i>Moments of tension in Parliament.</i>

10:43.977 --> 10:47.390
<i>At the nth unsuccessful attempt
to elect the Head of State,</i>

10:47.689 --> 10:52.104
<i>a section began
to exalt the Milan magistrates.</i>

10:52.318 --> 10:56.277
<i>The struggle between Andreotti
and Forlani for the presidency...</i>

10:56.447 --> 10:57.903
Yes?

10:58.116 --> 11:02.326
<i>Did you get my package?
Like the photo? Fond memories?</i>

11:03.329 --> 11:05.991
- <i>What</i> do <i>you want from me?</i>
- <i>700 million lire.</i>

11:07.458 --> 11:10.246
Who's got that?
You have nothing against me.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.749
<i>I have the proof you killed Bianca
Navarra, Fabrizio gave it to me.</i>

11:13.840 --> 11:16.502
<i>- I was supposed to destroy it...
- Hi. don't get you.</i>

11:16.718 --> 11:18.959
<i>No? You know that syringe?</i>

11:19.095 --> 11:23.840
<i>I have it, your prints are on it
and Bianca's blood. Enough?</i>

11:24.309 --> 11:26.266
I didn't kill anyone.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.803
<i>Let's have a judge decide.</i>

11:28.980 --> 11:30.971
Are things alright?

11:31.691 --> 11:34.228
Yes, a small problem
already resolved.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.855
<i>Popular indignation against
corruption continues.</i>

11:39.073 --> 11:42.282
<i>Colombo and Di Pietro,
don't slack, don't turn back!</i>

11:43.203 --> 11:46.195
I don't understand
why they get so much TV time.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.409
You're not answering?

11:52.670 --> 11:54.252
Answer.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.253
<i>This is your daughter's teacher.</i>

12:02.347 --> 12:05.214
- <i>What's</i> it <i>about?</i>
- <i>You should come right away.</i>

12:05.391 --> 12:08.759
<i>- There's a problem with Viola
-Yes, on my way.</i>

12:16.569 --> 12:18.685
- ls everything alright?
- Yes.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.663
People look at Milan and think:

12:30.750 --> 12:32.332
work, fashion, the Bocconi...

12:32.919 --> 12:34.705
All I see here is dirty money.

12:34.921 --> 12:38.004
It's dirty money that holds
the bricks of this city together.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.674
Bribery is an illness, a virus.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.841
Where are we going?

12:46.057 --> 12:50.221
We have a problem,
maybe a friend can help us out.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.686
That's Di Pietro!

12:54.440 --> 12:56.681
Send them all to jail!

12:56.859 --> 12:59.351
Yes, it's him!
He doesn't fool around!

13:00.446 --> 13:02.437
Tonino!

13:04.701 --> 13:06.283
Thank you, Tonino!

13:09.539 --> 13:12.327
Colombo and Di Pietro
don't slack, don't turn back!

13:18.047 --> 13:20.334
Milan is with you,
honest people are with you,

13:20.675 --> 13:23.133
we want them in jail!

13:40.570 --> 13:43.403
SANGUINE, PHLEGMATIC,
MELANCHOLIC, CHOLERIC

13:49.120 --> 13:50.952
Thank you for coming.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.326
I'm sorry I bothered you at work,
but it's important.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.002
Will you tell me what's happened?

14:10.058 --> 14:11.890
It's a bit delicate.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.680
<i>This is a diurnal, arboreal species.</i>

14:17.857 --> 14:22.192
<i>In the hours of midday,
they look for shelter in cool places</i>

14:22.278 --> 14:24.986
<i>and remain inactive
for about an hour.</i>

14:25.198 --> 14:30.659
<i>At night, they sleep in trees,
stretched out on the branches...</i>

14:44.759 --> 14:46.420
And that's the story.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.711
You see what comes
of emphasizing manual labor?

14:52.600 --> 14:55.843
Listen, I already have
lots of problems.

14:56.270 --> 14:59.683
- What's done in these cases?
- I'll have to inform the principal.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.683
- Viola risks being expelled.
- Or?

15:02.860 --> 15:06.103
There is no other solution,
it's extremely serious!

15:11.994 --> 15:13.405
May I?

15:15.790 --> 15:18.031
I'd like one too.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.013
What type are you?

15:38.688 --> 15:42.431
Phlegmatic, melancholic,
sanguine or choleric?

15:44.318 --> 15:47.731
According to Steiner,
we're a mixture.

15:49.198 --> 15:52.281
- You don't seem choleric.
- It's nothing to do with anger.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.194
It's for Viola's own good.

15:58.124 --> 16:00.115
Have you spoken to her?

16:04.839 --> 16:07.581
I wanted to speak to you first.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.543
Why are you embarrassed?

16:13.431 --> 16:15.547
I don't see
what I have to do with this.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.676
Talking about sex made you blush.

16:19.854 --> 16:21.265
Look here.

16:22.106 --> 16:23.892
Stop it.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.437
You have soft skin.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.061
There's a little sanguine
in each of us, isn't there?

16:40.082 --> 16:42.289
- Antonio!
- Giovanni!

16:49.008 --> 16:51.796
- Luca Pastore.
- Giovanni Falcone.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.052
Keep yourselves company.

16:56.849 --> 16:57.930
Have a seat.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.724
- Schifani.
- Pastore.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.929
Well?

17:05.107 --> 17:08.065
The lawyers made an agreement
among themselves,

17:08.277 --> 17:10.859
the industrialists started talking,

17:11.071 --> 17:13.530
they gave us the names
of a few politicians,

17:13.699 --> 17:16.737
get things off their chests,
even feel good about it.

17:17.078 --> 17:21.367
The point is, they sell us smoke
and keep the roast.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.866
Their money's in Switzerland
and what do we do?

17:24.961 --> 17:27.703
We write a letter of request
to check the bank accounts.

17:27.797 --> 17:31.256
- And the Swiss banks?
- They don't give a shit.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.374
Right!

17:32.677 --> 17:34.543
And we're blocked,

17:35.012 --> 17:38.130
if we don't find the money,
we won't conclude a fucking thing,

17:38.349 --> 17:41.307
actually Mani Pulite
risks ending right here.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.432
You have to circumvent the request.

17:46.941 --> 17:50.775
If you inquire into a total bank
position, they balk.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.687
You have to intervene specifically.

17:53.864 --> 17:56.606
There was a transaction
on July 10th?

17:57.159 --> 18:00.368
Ask for the bank statements
from July 1st to the 30th.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.117
You have proof, they can't deny you.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.159
And then maybe
you discover something else.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.540
How about dessert?

18:15.886 --> 18:18.423
With this belly, not me.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.262
C'mon...

18:33.321 --> 18:35.858
- What floor?
- Yours.

18:38.659 --> 18:39.899
Sorry.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.952
Don't worry, no one
knows his neighbor in Milan.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.199
Matteo.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.990
Leonardo.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.965
- Empty-handed this evening?
- Meaning?

18:55.843 --> 18:59.882
Your room abuts mine, sometimes
I have to sleep in the living room.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.963
I'm sorry.

19:02.099 --> 19:05.592
Don't be, once in a while women make
a mistake and knock on my door.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.515
- What do you do, study?
- No!

19:12.443 --> 19:16.027
Why invest in the future,
if you can make the present yield?

19:17.239 --> 19:18.604
Please.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.952
Where the fuck were you?
You said seven o'clock!

19:25.873 --> 19:27.955
Is he a more important customer
than me?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.249
You idiot, he's my neighbor.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.831
- Sorry.
- No problem.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.264
How embarrassing!

19:57.029 --> 20:00.112
I don't have a home anymore,
or a job, or a man

20:01.033 --> 20:02.990
and you have a daughter.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.278
We left you some pasta.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.577
- We two have to talk.
- About what?

20:16.924 --> 20:19.291
Forget it... Go do your homework.

20:22.096 --> 20:24.007
I'll leave you two alone.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.728
She's a darling!

20:43.159 --> 20:44.945
Her mother was a friend of mine,

20:45.161 --> 20:47.573
a lesbian, she wanted a baby.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.451
You accepted?

20:57.548 --> 21:00.290
I swear I'll stay
as little as possible.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.714
You're not the problem.

21:04.889 --> 21:06.379
What is?

21:08.100 --> 21:11.013
Viola jerked-off a classmate.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.979
The school called me, what mayhem!

21:15.983 --> 21:17.849
What did you do?

21:18.819 --> 21:21.186
I screwed the teacher.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.613
Organize a meeting
with your sister for me?

21:28.662 --> 21:31.620
I have to do a survey on
the Prosecutor's Office in Milan.

21:32.082 --> 21:33.664
If you like...

21:35.836 --> 21:37.577
I do.

21:47.056 --> 21:49.297
You can stay all you want.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.308
Do we play one happy family?

21:55.856 --> 21:59.065
Happy families
are only good for selling cookies.

22:17.044 --> 22:19.035
I didn't think I'd be seeing you.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.162
I didn't want to miss the scene,

22:21.257 --> 22:24.420
now that I'm no longer
the shame of the family.

22:26.387 --> 22:29.175
I don't understand
why you have it in for me.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.767
How do they treat you?

22:35.145 --> 22:37.386
Can you hold out
without French wine?

22:38.315 --> 22:40.773
Did I ever make you do anything?

22:41.110 --> 22:43.226
Maybe that's exactly the point.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.027
I wanted you to do

22:49.034 --> 22:51.617
what I couldn't, have fun.

22:51.787 --> 22:55.872
What a ball! My life's useless.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.409
It is, if all you think of is work,

22:59.670 --> 23:02.002
I never did anything
but work and now look.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.206
Visitors...

23:06.677 --> 23:08.167
I have to go.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.056
Bibi!

23:15.811 --> 23:17.802
I didn't want you to become like me.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.018
Maybe that's what I wanted.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.902
Open up?

23:34.455 --> 23:36.071
Goddammit!

23:42.713 --> 23:46.297
- Finally!
- Done? Where do you think you are?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.166
I'm Bosco, I live here.

23:48.302 --> 23:51.135
We close at midnight, no exceptions.

23:51.305 --> 23:54.263
I went out for a beer,
now I'm back, it wasn't...

23:57.645 --> 23:59.807
What the fuck?
It wasn't me who killed Jesus!

24:05.110 --> 24:08.023
- Sister, please...
- Rules are rules.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.272
It won't happen again, I promise.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.945
Thank you.

24:22.586 --> 24:25.419
Fuck, I went out for a beer,
she locked me out!

24:26.423 --> 24:28.289
What a great fucking idea
this place was.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.837
It's close to Parliament, low cost,

24:31.053 --> 24:32.919
and we all stay together.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.263
I'm sick of dormitories.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.925
Article by article.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.852
What the fuck does it mean?

24:42.022 --> 24:44.605
The procedure...

24:46.402 --> 24:49.315
It's Parliament integrated
with the regional representatives.

24:49.405 --> 24:52.693
- Integrated?
- Don't the Parliamentarians vote?

24:52.825 --> 24:56.193
Yes, but we don't elect Miglio.

24:57.037 --> 25:00.575
It's just to put pepper
up the others' asses!

25:02.918 --> 25:05.956
The election
for the President of Italy, right?

25:07.131 --> 25:09.839
Yes, good, the election
for the President of Italy.

25:10.759 --> 25:15.128
Now you go study and
let the grown-ups talk politics.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.346
Go to work!

25:19.685 --> 25:20.971
Go!

25:23.981 --> 25:28.771
The vote is open
for proposed legislation 3012B.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.062
In favor!

25:39.121 --> 25:43.331
I announce the vote by name
via electronic procedure

25:43.500 --> 25:47.334
on draft law 3137A:

25:47.921 --> 25:50.379
regulations in the matter of justice.

25:51.341 --> 25:52.581
Against!

25:53.385 --> 25:55.217
What are you doing? C'mon, vote!

25:58.974 --> 26:00.339
Vote!

26:03.604 --> 26:04.969
Good!

26:09.735 --> 26:12.318
Let me out, I'm leaving,
and not just from here.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.736
You stay here with your shit nuns!

26:14.948 --> 26:16.564
Come back here!

26:16.742 --> 26:19.450
Put a monkey in my seat,
it's the same thing.

26:19.661 --> 26:21.243
I've taken enough orders.

26:34.259 --> 26:38.548
MAY 17th

26:44.436 --> 26:45.972
Venturi !

26:49.566 --> 26:51.853
Pastore, don't you have a home?

26:53.946 --> 26:55.528
You slept in the Archive Room?

26:56.281 --> 26:58.318
I can't go home,
I've got a few messes.

26:59.159 --> 27:01.867
- Got a cigarette?
- I told you I don't smoke.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.957
You still have to tell me
why you're here on a Sunday.

27:13.340 --> 27:15.798
Mainaghi, could have guessed!

27:17.427 --> 27:20.260
Someday you'll tell me
why you're hooked on him.

27:20.514 --> 27:23.757
I was looking at the balance sheets,
the figures don't make sense.

27:26.353 --> 27:30.347
I think Mainaghi uses fictitious
firms to get his money out.

27:31.441 --> 27:34.479
- Did you tell the Beast?
- I just discovered it.

27:41.618 --> 27:43.529
What a hot babe!

27:47.249 --> 27:48.660
Hot chick, huh?

27:49.084 --> 27:51.951
I approached her
at the Pixies concert.

27:53.547 --> 27:55.788
You don't know the Pixies?

27:56.216 --> 27:57.581
And her?

27:57.801 --> 27:59.667
She told me to fuck off!

28:02.514 --> 28:05.006
I haven't had
a Sunday like this in ages.

28:06.059 --> 28:08.266
Will you help me get the dessert?

28:14.818 --> 28:16.934
- Is it true he's after Craxi?
- Di Pietro?

28:17.779 --> 28:20.737
The other day he was interrogating
Chiesa for the nth time,

28:20.866 --> 28:22.607
no one knew where.

28:22.659 --> 28:25.947
I go to the basement and hear Chiesa
yell from behind a door:

28:26.038 --> 28:28.029
"No, I won't give that name!"

28:28.248 --> 28:31.036
But the paper
wouldn't let me publish it.

28:31.251 --> 28:34.369
No one dares write that name
in an article on Mani Pulite.

28:38.300 --> 28:39.665
Are you married?

28:41.094 --> 28:42.209
No.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.053
Are you gay?

28:44.223 --> 28:48.091
- No. Why?
- And you haven't killed anyone.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.811
That's good,

28:53.315 --> 28:56.023
because she really cares for you.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.562
Have you got a boyfriend?

29:01.907 --> 29:03.693
Sort of.

29:04.618 --> 29:05.653
No.

29:08.288 --> 29:11.656
You're pretty,
I imagine all the boys are after you.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.366
No way!

29:14.753 --> 29:18.246
When I was in school,
there was a beautiful girl,

29:18.757 --> 29:21.795
but she didn't know
she was so pretty.

29:22.052 --> 29:24.419
She wanted everyone to like her,
to feel loved.

29:26.014 --> 29:28.676
So, she started going
with all the boys at school.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.221
And I mean every one.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.679
Then the boys stopped looking at her
as a pretty girl,

29:35.941 --> 29:38.683
but just a girl
to have fun with sometimes.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.811
In the end
she started feeling like that too.

29:43.156 --> 29:46.319
She went from one man to the next
even when she grew up.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.363
In other words, a whore.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.913
Let's go back in.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.701
Has she found a man
to really be with?

30:00.424 --> 30:01.755
Who knows!

30:03.677 --> 30:05.213
The cake.

30:08.181 --> 30:09.842
<i>My love!</i>

30:10.058 --> 30:13.096
My love, I want to be with you.

30:14.688 --> 30:16.395
Never leave me.

30:17.941 --> 30:19.932
<i>I want to be with you.</i>

30:20.819 --> 30:22.309
<i>Never leave me.</i>

30:32.664 --> 30:35.577
Does living together
affect you like this?

30:42.841 --> 30:44.423
What's the matter?

30:47.304 --> 30:49.466
Want to talk about it?

31:04.446 --> 31:06.733
You're like that painting.

31:10.327 --> 31:12.443
Elegant, cold...

31:13.538 --> 31:14.903
hurt.

31:27.844 --> 31:31.087
They're taking that painting away.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.139
Getting it fixed?

31:35.477 --> 31:37.059
Sold.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.970
Why? You liked it.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.565
Are you free for dinner tonight?

31:51.701 --> 31:53.112
Surprise.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.495
Wow!

32:19.396 --> 32:22.229
How's it feel to be
the most envied man here?

32:25.819 --> 32:27.685
Arrogance.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.400
Remember the time I hurt my ankle?

32:33.618 --> 32:36.656
You gave a whole speech
on the fear of change,

32:36.830 --> 32:38.286
what was the word?

32:40.125 --> 32:42.662
I don't remember, it doesn't matter.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.127
I've thought about it.

32:46.047 --> 32:49.130
If TV isn't what I really want?

32:50.093 --> 32:51.583
What would you like?

32:55.849 --> 32:57.305
Change?

33:01.938 --> 33:03.144
Good.

33:04.191 --> 33:06.808
That's exactly
why I wanted to talk to you.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.693
Why limit yourself
to the small screen,

33:15.076 --> 33:17.818
when you can shine
in a much bigger one?

33:19.414 --> 33:21.280
Here's your surprise.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.492
He's a producer from Rome,
Sergio Lucidi.

33:24.711 --> 33:27.669
I found you a job!
If I don't take care of you...

33:31.968 --> 33:34.050
You never change, how do you do it?

33:35.680 --> 33:38.092
Do you know Veronica Castello?

33:40.060 --> 33:42.518
You never change either.

33:42.729 --> 33:46.563
I have to go,
but I leave you in good company.

33:46.900 --> 33:49.608
Absolutely!
If you come to Rome, call me.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.689
Of course.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.441
Bye.

33:57.118 --> 34:00.406
Self-sabotage, that's the word.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.030
Bye!

34:07.420 --> 34:08.831
Leonardo's great.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.504
We met a few years ago,

34:11.967 --> 34:14.755
he organized a screen test for me...

34:28.108 --> 34:31.567
...it made more than in the first
two weeks combined, understand?

34:31.777 --> 34:33.360
Word of mouth!

34:36.157 --> 34:37.272
What are you doing?

34:38.409 --> 34:40.275
Are you leaving?

35:30.086 --> 35:31.872
Good girl, run!

35:35.675 --> 35:38.508
Did we wake you with the music?

35:38.928 --> 35:42.137
I'm mortified.
Are you the new lodger?

35:43.141 --> 35:46.133
Gaetano Nobile.
We haven't met, have we?

35:46.353 --> 35:48.310
No. Lower the volume.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.979
Why don't you join us?

35:51.441 --> 35:56.026
Go put some pants on
and I'll make up for it.

35:58.281 --> 36:02.195
If you want to stay like that, we're
worldly people, maybe the T-shirt...

36:02.410 --> 36:04.492
BRIBESVILLE

36:04.829 --> 36:07.742
I'm telling you for the last time,
lower the volume.

36:09.417 --> 36:10.782
Okay?

36:15.757 --> 36:19.091
They want to alienate me,
but they don't know who I am.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.509
The others talk because
it's in their interest.

36:22.263 --> 36:26.473
Give them the Socialists
and get out of here.

36:29.938 --> 36:31.679
I don't dump friends.

36:31.898 --> 36:35.232
They froze your accounts,
blocked your activities

36:36.319 --> 36:38.230
and that's nothing.

36:38.571 --> 36:42.030
If they keep digging and
the rest comes out, what happens?

36:53.211 --> 36:55.202
Give them what they want.

37:00.844 --> 37:02.255
Bye.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.218
Come in.

37:14.399 --> 37:17.858
I discovered how Mainaghi
accumulates his illegal funds.

37:22.532 --> 37:23.897
Will you tell me?

37:24.117 --> 37:27.951
One of the firms in the group
records a company's payment of 10,

37:28.037 --> 37:31.120
but it really pays only 2
and the remaining 8 is forwarded

37:31.291 --> 37:35.376
to a third firm abroad, which then
brings the money back, clean.

37:39.674 --> 37:42.132
- It's a theory.
- Plausible, right?

37:43.845 --> 37:46.428
I'll take this to the interrogation.

37:47.891 --> 37:49.882
You haven't heard?

37:50.310 --> 37:52.722
Mainaghi has decided to confess.

37:58.902 --> 38:00.859
So, how are you?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.566
I'm embittered,

38:04.032 --> 38:07.241
not so much because
you're abusing precautionary custody.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.576
You know you are.

38:09.954 --> 38:12.912
I'm embittered because
I thought I was stronger,

38:13.124 --> 38:16.207
so you won,
let's skip the pleasantries.

38:16.419 --> 38:19.753
Yes, they wouldn't have lasted long,
believe me.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.455
Pastore, are you ready?

38:23.843 --> 38:24.958
Yes.

38:36.105 --> 38:39.097
Mainaghi, is it true
you dumped the Socialists?

38:43.196 --> 38:45.688
I'm Castello.
What names did you give?

38:45.824 --> 38:48.907
Castello... just look at that!

38:59.963 --> 39:01.795
I missed you.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.338
Didn't you say
you'd rather be alone?

39:04.551 --> 39:07.134
Didn't you say you wouldn't talk?

39:16.271 --> 39:17.978
You let him out!

39:18.523 --> 39:20.890
You didn't ask about illegal funds.

39:21.067 --> 39:24.776
We'll move when we get proof!
Mainaghi confessed.

39:24.946 --> 39:27.153
- He gave a name.
- A small thing?

39:27.699 --> 39:30.031
Sir, the phone, it's urgent.

39:30.243 --> 39:32.325
Not now. Pastore, the door!

39:33.121 --> 39:37.957
Larini... Mainaghi said it's rumored
he takes Craxi the money.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.704
If it's true, we catch the Boar!

39:40.920 --> 39:43.412
- Your only interest is Craxi.
- And yours Mainaghi.

39:43.548 --> 39:47.542
Just his name makes you snap
to attention, what did he do to you?

39:48.678 --> 39:52.171
It was Falcone, he says
the requests have no attachments

39:52.390 --> 39:54.381
and he didn't take it very well.

39:54.684 --> 39:57.426
What the fuck,
you don't pass me Falcone?

39:58.021 --> 39:59.603
Contact Colombo!

40:01.816 --> 40:04.353
You didn't send him
the acts of the investigation.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.357
You don't even trust
Giovanni Falcone!

40:10.366 --> 40:14.030
What the fuck are you saying?
Who ever wrote a letter of request?

40:15.204 --> 40:17.036
Can you do one?

40:17.248 --> 40:18.909
Why should I justify to you?

40:19.125 --> 40:21.742
Get back in the archives,
that's where I need you!

40:36.601 --> 40:39.059
- Veronica?
- Gone.

40:41.814 --> 40:44.681
You sent her away
like you wanted to do with me?

40:46.235 --> 40:48.021
Think about your own messes!

40:48.237 --> 40:51.025
If it weren't for me,
you'd be expelled.

41:01.376 --> 41:02.832
I'm Off.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.712
<i>Miss me?</i>

41:14.931 --> 41:17.172
I've got it, all one hundred.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.388
<i>Hurrah!
Bring it to the station tomorrow.</i>

41:21.354 --> 41:24.892
<i>- That finishes it.
- Who knows? You have no choice.</i>

41:24.983 --> 41:28.692
<i>Actually, prison
is always an alternative.</i>

41:37.787 --> 41:39.448
TWO, THREE,
ONE HUNDRED DI PIETRO

41:39.664 --> 41:41.200
That's what people want.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.657
Throw them all in jail.

41:43.918 --> 41:47.127
They're in all the stalls in Milan:
"Di Pietro like Che Guevara",

41:47.213 --> 41:49.124
"Milan is a bandit,
Di Pietro can't stand it",

41:49.215 --> 41:51.456
Mani Pulite soaps, pins, gadgets,

41:51.676 --> 41:53.667
the game of Bribesville.

41:54.345 --> 41:57.838
They want handcuffs, and to yell
"in jail" to who governs them,

41:58.141 --> 42:02.100
they love seeing rich industrialists
sleep on filthy mattresses

42:02.311 --> 42:03.972
behind bars at San Vittore.

42:04.022 --> 42:07.310
It's an obsessive force,
marvelous, unstoppable.

42:07.525 --> 42:12.315
“Spaghetti Inquisitor,
rice plate San Vittore"...

42:12.530 --> 42:16.114
The Germans have a term:
Shadenfreude.

42:16.868 --> 42:19.735
It's the excitement felt
at others' misfortune.

42:20.288 --> 42:24.282
Italy is being flooded by an
unstoppable wave of Shadenfreude.

42:24.876 --> 42:29.336
- Do we give in to the wave?
- No, we ride it.

42:30.089 --> 42:32.672
But we don't dictate
the Fininvest course of action.

42:32.884 --> 42:36.502
I know, but you can
help news shows and papers

42:36.721 --> 42:39.179
see this is what
the country's belly wants.

42:39.390 --> 42:43.554
If they talk continuously about
Di Pietro, ratings and sales go up

42:43.811 --> 42:45.768
and so does our advertising income.

42:47.065 --> 42:49.227
Shadenfreude...

42:53.321 --> 42:58.816
MAY 23rd

43:37.782 --> 43:40.444
<i>...of the terrifying attack in which</i>

43:40.660 --> 43:44.198
<i>Judge Giovanni Falcone and 3 of
his security detail lost their lives.</i>

43:44.413 --> 43:46.279
<i>Twenty people are injured.</i>

43:46.499 --> 43:49.582
<i>The attack took place on the highway</i>

43:49.794 --> 43:52.001
<i>that links Palermo to Trapani.</i>

43:52.213 --> 43:56.502
<i>From Palermo, we have Cusimano.</i>

43:56.926 --> 44:02.137
<i>Here are the images
taken by our colleague</i>

44:02.306 --> 44:04.798
<i>who managed
to get through the barrier</i>

44:05.017 --> 44:08.976
<i>and shoot these scenes.</i>

44:09.438 --> 44:11.600
<i>They're dramatic, war-like scenes.</i>

44:11.816 --> 44:15.309
<i>That rubble hides, obstructs</i>

44:15.528 --> 44:18.896
<i>what was once a high way,
in the 20-km portion</i>

44:19.115 --> 44:23.530
<i>that goes from
the Punta Raisi airport to Palermo.</i>

44:23.703 --> 44:27.788
<i>The two lanes have been obliterated.</i>

44:27.999 --> 44:32.664
<i>We can see bent metal,
a car in the center</i>

44:33.212 --> 44:38.207
<i>and another behind it,
probably the bullet-proof car</i>

44:38.384 --> 44:41.217
<i>in which Falcone was traveling.</i>

44:41.470 --> 44:45.680
<i>Falcone was driving,
his wife next to him.</i>

44:45.892 --> 44:48.850
<i>We're already able to tell you</i>

44:49.770 --> 44:52.683
<i>that three agents have been killed.</i>

44:52.899 --> 44:55.482
<i>All three were from Apulia...</i>

45:01.866 --> 45:03.482
Neighbor!

45:05.286 --> 45:08.074
Still like the idea
of making the present yield?

46:11.227 --> 46:13.764
<i>What are you doing?
Playing hide-and-seek?</i>

46:13.980 --> 46:15.687
<i>Leo, Leo!</i>

46:15.856 --> 46:17.688
I put the money where you said.

46:17.817 --> 46:21.105
<i>Good, now go,
there's a train waiting.</i>

46:22.488 --> 46:23.944
A train?

46:24.240 --> 46:26.857
<i>The inter-regional for Genoa,
leaving from track 7.</i>

46:27.076 --> 46:29.408
<i>Did you hear? Track 7.</i>

46:31.038 --> 46:34.702
<i>Don't worry about the ticket,
go just one stop.</i>

46:34.917 --> 46:39.127
<i>Get off at Rogoredo
and then go calmly home.</i>

46:39.964 --> 46:42.001
<i>Hurry or you'll miss it.</i>

46:42.341 --> 46:44.423
<i>There, good boy.</i>

46:46.304 --> 46:48.591
<i>It's been nice
doing business with you.</i>

47:01.569 --> 47:04.402
Giovanni Falcone's death

47:04.697 --> 47:07.314
is an irreparable loss.

47:09.660 --> 47:13.028
But we in this Prosecutor's office
can do something:

47:13.331 --> 47:15.538
take him as an example.

47:16.167 --> 47:19.535
Like the anti-Mafia section,
we too will work in teams, united.

47:19.712 --> 47:22.579
We too have decided to create a pool

47:22.673 --> 47:26.462
with deputy procurators Di Pietro,
Colombo and, from today, Davigo.

47:28.429 --> 47:30.761
Welcome aboard, Piercamillo.

48:03.047 --> 48:04.788
There he is!

48:05.007 --> 48:06.998
The last on the right.

48:13.724 --> 48:16.842
He picked up
the money at the station.

48:19.230 --> 48:21.346
Who the fuck are you?

48:37.748 --> 48:39.409
NEXT TIME

48:39.500 --> 48:41.457
I ask that justice be done.

49:00.020 --> 49:02.136
We're not going to the show tonight.

49:06.402 --> 49:08.143
Parliament is like a chess board:

49:08.237 --> 49:10.604
you have to decide
to move as a pawn or a king.
