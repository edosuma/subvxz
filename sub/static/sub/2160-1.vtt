01:08.040 --> 01:09.963
- Hey!
- Shh shh shh!

01:10.120 --> 01:11.406
No. No no no.

01:11.560 --> 01:13.164
Just be quiet.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.491
- Oh shit!
- Aw, man, fucking...

01:15.640 --> 01:17.847
Shit. Shit. Shit.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.923
- Shit.
- Hey! Hey!

01:20.080 --> 01:22.242
- Get the fuck back here!

01:22.400 --> 01:24.880
- Hey, give me that fucking camera!

01:36.880 --> 01:38.644
Yeah, so you're
watching that footage I sent?

01:38.800 --> 01:40.040
Yeah, I fucking saw it. You--

01:40.240 --> 01:41.890
So as you probably guessed,
your wife hired me to get that.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.924
My problem is if I show it to her,
she stops paying me.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.691
So I was thinking you might want
to make a counter-offer there.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.922
Oh, and whatever number
you come up with,

01:50.080 --> 01:52.560
you can put 300 bucks on top
for the dent you put in my car.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.291
--Well, you scratched the paint anyway.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.886
You know what? If I don't hear from you
by tomorrow, your wife gets that file.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.690
- Goodbye.

02:00.840 --> 02:03.605
-So what's the deal now?
-Ah, probably nothing.

02:03.760 --> 02:06.240
Just this woman thinks
her son is missing.

02:07.480 --> 02:10.131
He hasn't been to class in a week.
He won't answer her calls.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.726
He's probably passed out
in a pile of beer cans.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.008
In which case we're gonna
take the kid on a road trip

02:15.160 --> 02:18.243
and rack up some expenses, 'cause we're
getting 1,000 bucks a day on this one.

02:19.360 --> 02:20.725
Turn left up here.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.161
- Your button cam's working?
- Yeah, it's working.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.090
This is it?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.167
Yeah.

02:36.280 --> 02:38.089
It doesn't look like
anyone's home.

02:38.240 --> 02:39.730
She couldn't give you a key?

02:39.880 --> 02:42.008
She doesn't have one.
She said the lock

02:42.160 --> 02:44.606
on the back window's busted,
so maybe we can get in that way.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.684
- And the cops haven't been here?
- No, the cops don't give a shit

02:47.840 --> 02:50.241
about some college kid
who's missing for a couple of days.

02:52.280 --> 02:54.009
Here.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.682
- ls there someone in there?

03:04.840 --> 03:07.047
--Here. Come on, give me the cam.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.202
There's nothing there. See?

03:19.360 --> 03:21.806
It sure as fuck sounded
like there's something in there.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.485
It's an old house.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.251
Besides, if there is somebody in there,
I'm gonna want to talk to 'em.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.050
Here.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.441
Ow.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.364
- You all right?
- Ow.

03:53.520 --> 03:56.091
Just great. Ow.

03:56.240 --> 03:57.844
You okay?

04:15.080 --> 04:16.809
Huh.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.250
- Um...
- What?

04:53.320 --> 04:55.641
You know what? Stay in here, okay?
I'm gonna go check

04:55.800 --> 04:58.644
the rest of this apartment and make sure
no one else is in here, okay?

04:58.800 --> 05:00.325
-You got your gun?
-Yeah.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.687
All right, good.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.571
Just--just, um, pull anything
relevant onto the drive.

05:05.720 --> 05:07.324
Okay? And record everything.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.403
That was part of the deal.
She likes me to do that.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.369
Well, you took my camera.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.090
Oh. Then...

05:15.880 --> 05:17.848
All right, so I'll be right back.
Just, um--

05:18.040 --> 05:20.361
just--I don't know, see what's
on that computer, okay?

05:20.520 --> 05:23.364
If it's encrypted, we can take it home.
If not, just pull what you can.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.806
Got it.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.851
Show her tits!

06:24.000 --> 06:26.446
I found a new one.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.524
It's third or fourth generation
from the quality.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.684
I--I got it from some guy
down in Little Armenia

06:32.840 --> 06:34.569
with a pawn shop.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.166
He is definitely not the type
of guy you usually see

06:37.320 --> 06:39.766
on here trading with us,
but I think he's somebody

06:39.960 --> 06:41.610
who's worth checking in on again.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.528
Okay.
That's fucking weird.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.762
Most of his
collection, I would say,

07:04.920 --> 07:08.208
was snuff and CP, but he had
at least one that was the real thing.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.368
I don't even think
he knew what it was.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.204
' Anyway...

08:27.160 --> 08:28.730
A little bit of redness,

08:28.880 --> 08:31.884
some irritation,
but it looks okay.

08:32.039 --> 08:33.804
- How's it working?
- It's good.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.645
Um, yeah, I can see,
but what about my other eye?

08:36.799 --> 08:38.802
-Follow.
-Okay.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.928
You can't see anything
out of your biological eye?

08:43.120 --> 08:45.487
-No.
-Okay.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.290
How about now?

08:49.440 --> 08:51.568
Yeah. I mean, it's a little better.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.643
It's just kind of blurry and shadowy.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.002
Yeah. All right.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.482
Well, because your prosthesis is
attached directly to your visual cortex,

09:00.680 --> 09:03.365
your real eye's essentially
battling with your camera eye

09:03.560 --> 09:04.891
to give you input right now.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.008
So when your brain gets used
to having that chip in there,

09:07.160 --> 09:09.766
you should start to see more and more
out of your uninjured eye again.

09:09.920 --> 09:12.207
Until then
you might see some glitches.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.402
What do you mean by glitches?

09:14.560 --> 09:16.528
Well, this is just being tested now.

09:16.680 --> 09:19.445
Eye injuries like yours are quite rare.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.080
So that's why we've installed
a recording chip

09:22.240 --> 09:25.130
into the eye itself so we can
test the data that it's receiving.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.964
Right. Yeah, about that.

09:27.120 --> 09:29.248
-Yes?
-Oh my God.

09:29.400 --> 09:32.324
So if I want private time,
what do I do?

09:32.480 --> 09:35.086
-How do I turn this off?
-Uh, well, you can't.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.129
But that's just for this trial period.

09:37.280 --> 09:39.487
I mean, you can't expect
the KPG Corporation

09:39.680 --> 09:42.650
to just give you this implant
and not expect to test its data.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.045
Of course not.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.680
So you guys are gonna sit around
and watch me take shits?

09:47.840 --> 09:50.446
I'd say that's a fair compromise,
Mr. Middleton.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.046
You can read a newspaper during,
or something.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.726
-Mm-hmm.
-So make an appointment for next week.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.240
We'll see how it's working.
Call me if you have any concerns.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.765
All right.
Thank you.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.930
What the hell?

10:17.240 --> 10:19.208
All right.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.329
♪ Fever, fever, fever... ♪

10:37.480 --> 10:38.527
- All right, man.
- All right.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.648
-Sure you gonna be okay, bud?
-Yeah, dude, I'm good. I'm good.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.245
All right, give me a shout
if you need anything.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.890
See ya.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.089
What the fuck?
Where'd I put that controller?

11:53.240 --> 11:54.924
_ Oh--

11:58.680 --> 11:59.806
All righty, then.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.011
What the...?

12:10.160 --> 12:12.128
Okay.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.681
What the fuck?

12:38.840 --> 12:41.207
- Hello?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.843
Hello?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.561
Oh, come on.
What the fuck is this shit?

13:07.560 --> 13:08.891
Oh shit.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.769
--Jesus!Fuck!

13:17.960 --> 13:19.405
Oh shit.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.970
Yeah. Yeah, I can tell
the difference

13:28.160 --> 13:30.766
between a burst of light
and a fucking bloody person, okay?

13:31.800 --> 13:33.928
I don't know, you tell me.
You're the doctor.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.401
Look, I'm coming in there tomorrow

13:37.560 --> 13:40.086
and you're gonna fix this fucking thing
and that's that, okay?

13:40.240 --> 13:42.288
Fine.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.363
All right, thank you.

13:48.680 --> 13:50.682
Fuck.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.130
Hello?

14:24.360 --> 14:25.805
Is somebody down there?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.643
Seriously, don't fuck with me.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.643
Oh, God damn it.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.689
- Hello?

14:38.680 --> 14:40.091
- Shit!

14:43.840 --> 14:45.683
- Oh fuck.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.370
Who the fuck?

14:50.520 --> 14:52.284
--Shit.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.446
- Uh uh, hello?

15:06.600 --> 15:08.011
Shit! Uh, okay!

15:08.160 --> 15:09.525
I'm good.

15:09.720 --> 15:11.802
- Thank you, you can go.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.450
Oh shit!

15:13.640 --> 15:15.483
Oh fuck!

15:29.120 --> 15:30.690
Oh my God.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.650
Oh, God damn it.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.445
Oh shit.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.890
Oh shit.

16:56.640 --> 16:58.244
What the...?

16:59.240 --> 17:01.129
Hey, are you in there?

17:02.520 --> 17:05.126
Look, I can see you
through the peephole.

17:07.079 --> 17:09.242
Weren't you
at the doctor's office yesterday?

17:10.240 --> 17:11.241
Yeah.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.527
Okay, so what's the deal?
Are you following me?

17:14.720 --> 17:17.371
I'm not following you. I--

17:17.520 --> 17:19.363
look, just open the door.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.364
All right, listen,
I don't mean to be rude,

17:22.560 --> 17:26.281
-but it's kind of weird, you know?
-Look, are you seeing weird stuff?

17:26.480 --> 17:28.323
Like people who look dead?

17:28.520 --> 17:30.409
You should really open the door.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.565
Thank you.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.210
I'm Clarissa.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.646
Yeah, come on in.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.486
- Nice place, man.
- Thanks.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.130
Do you have any beer?

17:48.280 --> 17:50.044
I do. Yes.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.170
What about painkillers?
Did the doctor give you any?

17:53.320 --> 17:55.368
No, I'm not actually in any pain.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.249
I'll just take a beer then.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.768
Look, Clarissa,
I'm actually on my way out of here.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.003
Dude, you're not gonna get anywhere
if you don't hear what I have to say.

18:04.160 --> 18:06.640
Just give me a beer,
get one for yourself.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.609
You're gonna need it.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.569
Right.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.042
-Thanks.
-Sure.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.448
I was born deaf.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.762
When I was 16
my parents put me up

18:27.960 --> 18:29.644
for a new cochlear implant.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.244
It worked, obviously.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.682
But I began to be able to pick up
certain frequencies in my environments.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.248
What happened
to your eye anyway?

18:40.400 --> 18:42.641
I was in a, um--

18:42.800 --> 18:44.802
in a car accident.

18:46.640 --> 18:48.563
So who's the little girl?

18:48.720 --> 18:50.609
What little girl?

18:50.760 --> 18:52.728
There's a little girl here.

18:52.880 --> 18:55.201
I heard her crying when I came in.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.089
But you know...

18:59.280 --> 19:01.442
I don't hear her now.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.127
Some people never
hear them or see them--

19:06.280 --> 19:08.567
maybe once in their entire lives,

19:08.720 --> 19:10.051
if they're open to it.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.089
So...

19:12.240 --> 19:15.005
when you can sense them,
they know.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.969
They can tell.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.048
That's why I wanted to find you...

19:21.120 --> 19:22.201
to warn you.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.966
Warn me about what?

19:26.000 --> 19:27.490
Yeah.

19:28.560 --> 19:31.609
The more you interact with them,
the more they can

19:31.760 --> 19:33.330
touch you,

19:33.520 --> 19:35.124
hurt you,

19:35.280 --> 19:36.486
stuff.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.369
Well, tomorrow
I'm gonna get this fuckin' thing

19:39.520 --> 19:41.488
taken out of my head
and that'll be that, right?

19:41.640 --> 19:43.085
Don't be so sure.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.647
Have you ever done
anything bad to anybody?

19:46.640 --> 19:48.688
Look, if you get
the implant taken out,

19:48.840 --> 19:50.569
they're still gonna be there.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.041
You're just not gonna
be able to see 'em.

19:53.200 --> 19:55.601
I don't know,
maybe that's better.

19:55.760 --> 19:59.128
Well, I guess--oh shit!

19:59.280 --> 20:01.203
Um, I don't want
to alarm you right now,

20:01.360 --> 20:03.806
but there's a fucking creepy dude
standing right behind you.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.088
I know. I can hear him.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.801
-Do you know him or something?
-He was my uncle.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.167
Oh, of course, right.
I mean--

20:12.320 --> 20:15.244
well, I didn't mean to call him
creepy, but I mean--

20:15.440 --> 20:17.283
- He wasn't a nice person.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.369
Okay.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.122
-Jesus.
-I know how to make him go away.

20:23.320 --> 20:25.004
-Just focus on me.
-Okay.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.043
Oh!

20:27.240 --> 20:29.527
Holy shit.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.804
No, don't look at him.
Look at me.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.849
Oh.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.803
Oh shit.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.762
All right, you scientist assholes,

21:14.960 --> 21:16.769
I want a copy of that footage.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.088
Like, I want you to put it
on a disc or something,

21:19.240 --> 21:20.571
but don't watch it.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.604
Just get it to me, okay?

21:24.880 --> 21:26.405
All right.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.563
Oh fuck.

21:35.240 --> 21:37.811
Oh, God damn it.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.444
Clarissa?

21:42.600 --> 21:44.443
Is that you?

21:45.640 --> 21:47.051
H6]!-

21:48.680 --> 21:50.409
Oh shit!

21:57.160 --> 21:58.400
H6]!-

21:58.560 --> 22:00.528
Oh God.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.129
Oh shit.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.968
- Ow!
- What the fuck?

22:23.200 --> 22:24.929
Clarissa, give me your hands!

22:25.080 --> 22:27.242
Fuck.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.288
--C'mere.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.969
<i>I got you.</i>

22:35.960 --> 22:38.201
--Give me your hand.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.247
--Oh fuck!

23:52.880 --> 23:56.441
Oh oh oh oh.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.086
All right.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.168
You're coming out of here,
you fucker.

24:12.480 --> 24:14.608
Eww...
oh, I can't look at this shit.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.404
Oh God.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.445
Okay.

24:54.920 --> 24:56.684
Oh shit!

25:21.840 --> 25:23.171
Larry?

25:24.480 --> 25:26.130
Larry!

25:28.480 --> 25:31.324
Hey, keep your voice down. What?

25:31.480 --> 25:32.925
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.003
I just watched something
really weird.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.764
It couldn't have been reals.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.321
Okay.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.244
Is there anything on that computer?

25:41.400 --> 25:44.210
I'm cloning his hard drive now.
It shouldn't take too long.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.203
Here, look at this.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.688
Tape is the final link for me.

25:49.840 --> 25:53.049
Um, I know a lot of you
have posted that

25:53.200 --> 25:55.806
it only affects you if you play it
in a correct sequence.

25:55.960 --> 25:59.567
But I've been experimenting on--

26:01.560 --> 26:04.211
-Is this the kid?
-Yeah, that's him.

26:04.360 --> 26:07.011
I found some notebooks in his room,
kind of like journals.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.686
Mostly just nonsense though.
I'm going through them right now.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.046
Why don't you, like,
keep looking at these tapes?

26:14.200 --> 26:16.202
The kid's a collector.
I don't know. Who knows?

26:16.360 --> 26:17.964
Maybe there's something
relevant on them.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.406
Oh.

26:19.560 --> 26:21.164
Um... okay.

26:21.320 --> 26:23.687
We're all just electromagnetic energy.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.969
If these analog tapes capture
the images of the supernatural,

26:27.120 --> 26:30.647
they can affect our cerebral cortex.
They--they--

27:11.520 --> 27:12.726
Hey, babe.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.882
Don't "Hey, babe" me, Mike Sullivan.

27:15.040 --> 27:18.089
- We're supposed to be having breakfast.
- Yeah, but it's a beautiful day.

27:18.280 --> 27:19.930
I just want to take the bike
out for a spin.

27:20.080 --> 27:22.481
I wanted you to take me for a spin.

27:22.640 --> 27:25.007
You know, you ride that bike
more than you ride me.

27:25.200 --> 27:29.091
Yeah, but you know the bike
is just a physical thing, babe.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.288
Mm-hmm.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.330
Now tell me you love me.

27:34.480 --> 27:36.608
- I love you.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.290
Okay, good enough.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.807
-Be safe, babe.
-All right, bye.

28:10.040 --> 28:12.361
Help! Help me! Please!

28:13.360 --> 28:14.805
-Are you okay?
' MY boyfriend!

28:15.000 --> 28:16.650
- You have to help my boyfriend!

28:16.840 --> 28:19.002
--I'm getting help.

28:19.160 --> 28:21.288
No, please! Help Dan!

28:23.800 --> 28:26.167
Oh God!

28:26.320 --> 28:28.971
Hey.
Hey hey hey, stay with me.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.804
- Shit!

28:30.960 --> 28:33.201
Fuck! God.

28:38.520 --> 28:40.443
--Who's there?

28:42.840 --> 28:45.571
The police are right behind me,
so you'd better run!

28:48.400 --> 28:50.368
I got a big fucking stick!

28:53.880 --> 28:55.564
What the fuck?

28:57.680 --> 28:59.762
Oh.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.530
Hey hey, come on, we've got to go!

29:01.680 --> 29:04.126
--Whoa, aah!

29:05.840 --> 29:07.330
Ow, get off!

29:15.240 --> 29:17.686
Die, you fucking bitch!

29:17.840 --> 29:19.763
You fucking bitch!

29:45.040 --> 29:47.281
Oh God.

29:48.840 --> 29:51.446
Okay okay Okay"-

30:00.120 --> 30:01.610
Help. Help!

31:29.560 --> 31:32.609
Honey, are you sure
you know where you're going?

31:32.760 --> 31:35.764
- This does not look like a trail.
- Of course I know where I'm going.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.366
- Just trust me.
- How can you tell?

31:38.520 --> 31:41.171
- Well, it used to be a trail.
- There's no trail here.

31:42.840 --> 31:44.729
This doesn't look
familiar to you at all?

31:44.920 --> 31:46.729
No, not whatsoever.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.604
I mean it's pretty,
I'll give you that much.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.404
Holy shit.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.130
Oh my God.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.565
Is he...?

32:02.240 --> 32:03.685
I think so.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.888
It looks like
he's been bit by something.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.371
Yeah.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.122
Will you check his pulse,
just to be sure?

32:14.840 --> 32:16.126
Nothing.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.442
My God, I mean,
what could have done this?

32:18.600 --> 32:19.681
I don't know.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.763
I don't know.
An animal?

32:21.960 --> 32:24.566
Oh, um, yes, hello.
We found someone.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.246
He's, like, covered in blood
and there's no pulse.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.609
We're on the bike trails and--

32:30.800 --> 32:33.007
I mean, it looks like he's been
bit by something.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.889
-It's a bite, right?
-That would be my guess.

32:36.560 --> 32:38.483
Um, what state park is this?
I don't remember.

32:38.680 --> 32:41.843
-This is Gold Stone State Park.
-Yeah, we're at Gold Stone State Park.

32:42.000 --> 32:45.243
Um, but I'm not sure exactly
where we are here.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.488
It's the--
the trail off of Highway One.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.847
Yeah, on the trails
off of Highway One.

32:51.080 --> 32:53.162
-Okay.
-They're sending somebody?

32:53.360 --> 32:55.806
They're gonna send--
connect us with a park ranger.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.325
Okay.

32:57.480 --> 32:58.766
Holy shit.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.127
- God.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.525
-Wait a minute.
-Honey, what are you doing?

33:06.680 --> 33:08.284
I think I heard a noise.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.169
-What kind of noise?
-I don't know.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.482
- It's like he said something.

33:12.640 --> 33:14.210
Hey. Hey. Hey hey.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.601
--Hey! Hey hey! Let go!

33:16.800 --> 33:18.848
--Get off me! Get off me, man!

33:21.640 --> 33:24.291
Get off of him!
Stop it! Stop it!

33:25.560 --> 33:26.721
No!

33:26.880 --> 33:29.042
- Get off, get off! Stop it!

33:29.200 --> 33:31.680
Oh my God!

33:47.520 --> 33:49.443
Mmm.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.008
Mmmm.

36:08.040 --> 36:09.644
--Yay!

36:09.800 --> 36:11.484
Happy birthday!

36:13.080 --> 36:14.764
Happy birthday, Bianca.

36:20.680 --> 36:22.125
All right, honey.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.209
Go! Go!

36:41.000 --> 36:43.128
--Hey!

36:57.880 --> 36:59.962
Get in the car. Get in the car.
Let's go. Hurry hurry hurry.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.565
Faster faster faster.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.245
Hurry up-Hun']! UP-
Hurry hurry.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.721
- Get in. Get in. Get in.

37:09.720 --> 37:12.166
Come on, dude, do it.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.283
Aah! No no no!

37:17.200 --> 37:19.407
--Oh shit!

38:50.520 --> 38:52.284
Mike?

38:52.440 --> 38:55.683
Mike? Mi-ike?

38:55.840 --> 38:57.171
Hello?

38:57.320 --> 38:59.129
Mike?
Mike, Mike, Mike.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.890
Are you okay?

39:03.080 --> 39:06.402
You butt-dialed me, goofball.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.845
Oh well, I love you, baby.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.526
Can't wait for you
to get home. Bye.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.204
Hey, how's it going in here?

40:19.240 --> 40:20.844
Hey-

40:28.880 --> 40:30.370
sorry-

40:30.520 --> 40:32.329
I must've fallen asleep.

40:33.320 --> 40:35.243
Oh my God.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.409
Your nose is bleeding.

40:38.560 --> 40:40.847
Don't tilt your head back.
It'll just go down your throat.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.361
This one of your migraines?

40:43.520 --> 40:45.807
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

40:46.000 --> 40:47.525
Are your pills in your purse?

40:47.680 --> 40:49.489
Yeah.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.601
They're not in here. Could you have
left them at your apartment?

40:58.760 --> 41:01.286
I don't--maybe. I don't know. I--

41:03.280 --> 41:06.409
All right, so what do you want me to do?
We passed a drugstore on the way here.

41:06.560 --> 41:09.530
I could go back,
get you some aspirin or something.

41:10.880 --> 41:12.370
Yeah.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.409
I don't feel like moving.

41:16.040 --> 41:18.566
All right, well,
I feel kind of weird leaving you--

41:18.720 --> 41:20.643
Just go.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.522
Okay. I'll be right back.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.651
Malik, I'm getting audio, but no visual.

41:58.800 --> 42:01.406
- You check the connection?
- Wait wait.

42:01.560 --> 42:02.766
Okay, how about now?

42:02.920 --> 42:04.490
That's, um--

42:04.640 --> 42:06.483
okay, we're good.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.688
- We're good?
- We're good.

42:08.840 --> 42:10.046
All right.

42:11.520 --> 42:12.806
Let me see.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.883
All right, perfect.
Now switch to Lena-cam.

42:15.040 --> 42:16.371
All right.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.010
Do you see me, gents?

42:19.040 --> 42:20.371
Crystal clear.

42:20.520 --> 42:22.682
Adam, can you tell?

42:22.840 --> 42:24.968
No. From here, not a thing.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.804
But if I zoom in...

42:28.720 --> 42:31.644
- The top button, Adam.
- Well?

42:32.880 --> 42:35.326
Let's just say
you really have to be looking for it.

42:36.440 --> 42:39.205
Excuse me if I'm wrong but, paradise?

42:39.360 --> 42:41.931
Yes, that's correct,
our paradise.

42:43.440 --> 42:51.450
This, all you see before you,
is temporary.

42:53.320 --> 42:58.406
There is a higher order,
another plane of existence.

42:59.520 --> 43:03.127
My family and I, all of my disciples

43:03.280 --> 43:08.280
we're getting closer and closer
to crossing over to the promised gates.

43:15.080 --> 43:18.163
You mean in a spiritual sense,
metaphorically speaking--

43:18.360 --> 43:23.491
No, not a metaphor!
It's as literal as it gets.

43:23.640 --> 43:26.450
It's here in this world.

43:26.600 --> 43:29.331
It has already begun.
We're on the precipice of...

43:30.440 --> 43:32.488
We're on the verge of...

43:33.600 --> 43:36.444
Do you have to be so close?

43:39.040 --> 43:40.280
Just doing my job here.

43:40.440 --> 43:45.048
We'd love to discuss this further,

43:45.200 --> 43:47.407
but in a more suitable location.

43:47.600 --> 43:51.446
I was wondering
if we could come and visit

43:51.600 --> 43:55.924
your family at the commune
and continue this interview...

43:56.080 --> 43:58.003
No, I'm sorry.

44:00.120 --> 44:06.571
I do not allow nonbelievers
to enter Paradise Gates.

44:07.880 --> 44:12.010
Experience has taught us
that in your eyes we are seen

44:12.160 --> 44:16.131
as nothing more
than a carnival freakshow.

44:16.280 --> 44:17.930
- I understand, sir, but...
- Malik.

44:18.080 --> 44:22.688
Excuse me, sir, but that's why
we want your approval.

44:22.840 --> 44:28.688
We want to show
an unbiased view of your family.

44:28.840 --> 44:30.729
No editorial slant,

44:30.880 --> 44:34.327
just a platform for you
to show our viewers

44:34.520 --> 44:37.364
the truth behind the ideology
at Paradise Gates.

44:44.640 --> 44:45.926
What do you say?

45:25.960 --> 45:27.564
Yo, Adam.

45:27.720 --> 45:29.882
-Would you pass me the spy cam?
-Where?

45:30.080 --> 45:31.605
In my bag.
In the front.

45:31.760 --> 45:34.001
-Sure.
-Thanks, man.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.363
-Here, heads up.
-Whoa!

45:44.520 --> 45:46.682
You're a fucking dick,
you know that?

45:56.520 --> 45:58.090
Okay, guys'

45:59.080 --> 46:01.401
Madame, my name is Malik.

46:01.560 --> 46:04.689
-This is my crew.
-Hi, I'm Lena. I'm the producer.

46:04.840 --> 46:06.729
-Hello.
-It was quite a journey.

46:06.880 --> 46:09.281
Yes, we found being
too close to the city

46:09.440 --> 46:11.488
was a little dangerous for Father.

46:11.640 --> 46:14.689
-It's safer for us out here.
-I see...

46:14.840 --> 46:18.731
We can't let any harm come to Father.

46:20.080 --> 46:23.801
He's our sole shepherd
on our journey to immortality.

46:23.960 --> 46:27.851
-You've got a large compound here.
-Yes, out of necessity.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.924
-Hi, what's your name?
-This is Lydia.

46:31.080 --> 46:33.242
Hi, Lydia. Oh.

46:34.520 --> 46:36.090
Thank you.

46:37.800 --> 46:40.406
Did the other little girls help you?

46:40.560 --> 46:42.927
I'm not a girl anymore.
Father took care of--

46:43.080 --> 46:46.402
Enough, Lydia.
Tend to your sisters now.

46:46.560 --> 46:47.721
Please follow me.

46:47.880 --> 46:49.291
Yeah, all right.

46:55.080 --> 46:57.481
Oh, wait. Wait wait wait wait.

46:59.200 --> 47:00.531
Wait.

47:02.760 --> 47:05.604
Hey, Lena, you want
to upsize that thing?

47:07.520 --> 47:09.966
No, this is creepy, man.
I don't want to wear this.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.723
Hey, Joni.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.008
This belongs to you, man.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.764
Hey, Joni, Adam, come here.

47:18.920 --> 47:20.649
Coming coming coming.

47:40.800 --> 47:42.962
How many children are in the commune?

47:43.120 --> 47:45.043
Twenty in total.

47:45.200 --> 47:47.567
How about Father?
Does he have any children?

47:47.720 --> 47:50.929
- We are all Father's children here.

47:58.840 --> 48:00.524
- Our Father...

48:00.680 --> 48:02.523
Joni, not too bright.

48:02.680 --> 48:04.170
Sorry, madame.

48:04.320 --> 48:07.961
Our almighty Father has a lot
of responsibilities for his family.

48:08.120 --> 48:09.121
Adam.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.924
As you spend more time with him

48:11.080 --> 48:14.766
- you'll grow to appreciate our ways.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.369
How long have you
had this building?

48:22.520 --> 48:24.249
For some time.

48:24.400 --> 48:27.210
Ah, here are Father's
little chosen ones.

48:36.160 --> 48:38.003
Would it be okay for us to film them?

48:38.160 --> 48:40.845
You can film only what Father allows.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.731
Hey,
we're not the only one filming, guys.

48:44.720 --> 48:49.123
Yes, those. Security purposes.

48:50.200 --> 48:51.645
Please, this way.

48:51.800 --> 48:52.881
Yeah.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.841
Okay, we'll be ready to start soon, sir.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.207
I'd like to start by getting
your perspective,

49:01.360 --> 49:04.762
then we'll move on
to your family and the commune.

49:04.960 --> 49:06.086
Are you all right?

49:08.280 --> 49:10.362
-I am fine. I am ready.
-Okay.

49:11.440 --> 49:13.886
Dude, can you speed things up?

49:17.680 --> 49:19.330
Don't forget his. Go.

49:19.480 --> 49:22.086
Dude, there's blood on the mic.

49:23.800 --> 49:26.565
Sir, are you sure
you're okay to do this interview?

49:29.280 --> 49:31.567
I've waited a long time for this day.

49:31.720 --> 49:34.564
In that case,
we'll start straightaway.

49:34.720 --> 49:36.006
- I'd like to ask...

49:36.200 --> 49:39.249
Wait. Are you okay?

49:40.320 --> 49:42.084
I'm fine.

49:42.240 --> 49:44.766
All right, so as I said...

49:44.960 --> 49:47.042
--...I'd like to begin by asking you...

49:50.240 --> 49:52.049
You okay?

49:54.200 --> 49:56.441
Excuse me, sir, the restroom?

49:57.440 --> 50:02.162
Go downstairs, third door on the left.

50:02.320 --> 50:04.402
- Thank you.
- Lena, you okay?

50:04.600 --> 50:06.090
Just start without me.

50:06.240 --> 50:08.163
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.527
Come on, let's start.

50:10.680 --> 50:12.967
Yeah, um...

50:14.480 --> 50:16.721
Hey, you know what? Sorry.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.604
You want me to go check on Lena?

50:19.760 --> 50:21.125
There's no need.

50:21.280 --> 50:22.930
Just to make sure she's fine.

50:23.120 --> 50:27.125
Do not be
worried, Madame will take care of her.

50:27.280 --> 50:29.203
It's okay, sir. Technical issues.

50:30.200 --> 50:32.521
Exactly, sir.

50:32.680 --> 50:36.605
He'll do field control
and leave us to talk.

50:36.800 --> 50:41.169
Well, first I must start
with a somewhat challenging question.

50:41.320 --> 50:47.930
A question that I am sure
is on most people's minds.

50:48.080 --> 50:50.765
Regarding your lifestyle,

50:50.920 --> 50:56.211
specifically the relationship
you have with the children here.

50:56.400 --> 50:58.767
What's your point?

50:58.920 --> 51:02.003
--Okay.

51:11.360 --> 51:13.966
Hey, kids, where's your teacher?

51:17.760 --> 51:20.001
Wow, these are really great.

51:22.040 --> 51:23.769
What's this a painting of?

51:25.680 --> 51:28.524
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to just barge in.

51:28.680 --> 51:31.126
Beautiful, aren't they?

51:31.280 --> 51:33.203
Yes, they are.

51:33.400 --> 51:35.687
But not as beautiful
as yours will be.

51:35.840 --> 51:38.286
Excuse me?

51:38.440 --> 51:42.889
No, you will bear something
very special indeed.

51:43.040 --> 51:45.611
You are very blessed.

51:45.760 --> 51:48.889
- Wait, don't be scared.
- Hey, Lena.

51:49.880 --> 51:51.370
You okay?

51:51.520 --> 51:53.966
- Excuse me, madame.
- Lena, what's wrong?

51:58.360 --> 52:00.249
Yo. Hey, Lena.

52:00.400 --> 52:01.401
What happened?

52:01.560 --> 52:04.643
In order to follow
this path you have to remain pure.

52:04.800 --> 52:07.724
I can help maintain that purity.

52:07.880 --> 52:11.566
They bring their wives, their children

52:11.720 --> 52:15.770
so that I may wash away
their impurities.

52:15.920 --> 52:19.606
Wash away their impurities?
They're still children.

52:19.760 --> 52:22.604
You may see it as unnatural,

52:22.760 --> 52:25.843
but we see it as a progression.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.082
I see it as underage children

52:28.240 --> 52:31.084
involved in what many consider
illegal behavior, sir.

52:31.240 --> 52:33.322
I have blessed them.

52:33.480 --> 52:35.960
They will stand by me on the front line,

52:36.120 --> 52:38.646
in the heavenly glow of the gates.

52:39.680 --> 52:42.604
Oh, how long they have waited.

52:42.800 --> 52:46.043
Men in robes may seek
heaven in the skies.

52:46.200 --> 52:48.202
But not me.

52:48.360 --> 52:50.567
I do not need to look upwards.

52:50.720 --> 52:52.848
I simply look ahead.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.048
For paradise is right in front of me

52:55.200 --> 52:57.567
and I hold the key to unlock the gates.

52:57.720 --> 53:00.724
Pull with all my might,
I will open the gates of paradise.

53:00.880 --> 53:04.123
-This world of ours is temporary.
-Um... Malik?

53:04.320 --> 53:07.324
-This is just the beginning.
-Sorry, the battery is almost out.

53:07.480 --> 53:09.369
- Seriously?
- My bad.

53:09.520 --> 53:12.603
-I thought I charged it yesterday.
-Man! Don't worry, I got this.

53:12.760 --> 53:15.650
Sir, please excuse me a moment.

53:15.800 --> 53:18.041
- Where are you going?
- We need a spare battery.

53:18.200 --> 53:19.725
I'll be right back.

53:46.200 --> 53:48.521
Batteries, batteries.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.162
It's been over a day, Adam.

54:01.120 --> 54:04.602
Listen, I need to know whether it's
going to be me or you telling Malik.

54:04.800 --> 54:07.007
We owe it to him.

54:08.040 --> 54:09.849
Are you even sure it's mine?

54:12.280 --> 54:14.647
-Malik and I haven't--
-Haven't what?

54:15.680 --> 54:17.648
It's been a while.

54:19.760 --> 54:21.728
Fuck! He's my fucking--

54:21.880 --> 54:24.486
-he's my fucking best friend.
-And he's my fiancé.

54:26.040 --> 54:29.010
Adam, I am pregnant
and you're the father.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.850
Just cover your fucking camera.

54:35.160 --> 54:37.242
Do you think I wanted this to happen?

54:39.960 --> 54:41.564
Hey hey, come on, come on.

54:41.720 --> 54:43.324
Listen.

54:43.480 --> 54:45.209
We can go see someone,

54:45.360 --> 54:46.805
fix this,

54:46.960 --> 54:48.803
no one's gonna know.

54:48.960 --> 54:50.769
What the fuck?

54:50.920 --> 54:53.366
- What?
- Fuck you!

54:53.560 --> 54:56.530
I don't need you.
I'll tell Malik myself.

54:57.560 --> 54:59.324
And whether or not I keep this,

54:59.520 --> 55:02.091
and whether or not he walks,
I still don't fucking need you!

55:02.240 --> 55:03.969
What?

55:04.120 --> 55:06.043
You heard me.

55:07.040 --> 55:09.486
Fine.
Decision made.

55:09.640 --> 55:12.041
Fuck me, fuck you, fuck him.

55:13.360 --> 55:15.328
God damn it.

55:37.680 --> 55:43.289
In your opinion what
do you think about organized religion...

55:43.480 --> 55:45.209
- It's time.

55:45.400 --> 55:46.606
What?

55:47.800 --> 55:50.883
Brothers and sisters.

55:51.040 --> 55:53.964
My children.

55:54.160 --> 55:56.891
Lovers of my life.

55:57.080 --> 55:59.526
Follow me,

55:59.680 --> 56:03.685
for I have been the compass
of your souls.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.131
Months...

56:06.280 --> 56:09.170
--Even years...

56:09.320 --> 56:12.324
Oh, it felt like an eternity.

56:13.360 --> 56:16.170
But now we are approaching
the final steps.

56:16.320 --> 56:19.767
Today, at this very moment,

56:19.920 --> 56:23.641
- we will reach our salvation.

56:23.800 --> 56:25.928
--This is it!

56:26.080 --> 56:29.084
--The final key to Paradise is ours.

56:29.280 --> 56:32.443
Father has been waiting for you,
we must go to him directly.

56:36.040 --> 56:40.887
-My wives and my children.
-Take one cup each, my little ones.

56:41.080 --> 56:44.050
-Don't waver from your path.
-Make sure to drink every drop.

56:44.200 --> 56:47.204
Yesterday you were tainted and sullied.

56:47.360 --> 56:50.682
Today you stand as angels of purity.

56:50.880 --> 56:55.488
Don't be afraid, hold firm.
Guide yourself to the promised land.

56:55.680 --> 56:58.684
Take into your hearts
what you're about to do...

56:58.840 --> 57:00.444
Sir?

57:01.520 --> 57:04.046
- Don't fucking interrupt me!

58:13.200 --> 58:16.283
Oh shit! Jesus!

58:28.800 --> 58:31.087
--Oh, fuck fuck fuck!

58:34.880 --> 58:36.803
- Fuck it!

58:43.560 --> 58:47.963
And for my sons and brothers!

58:48.120 --> 58:51.408
Our path is filled
with unholy obstacles,

58:51.560 --> 58:57.203
but as we step closer to him,
boulders shall become

58:57.360 --> 59:00.045
mere pebbles.

59:00.200 --> 59:03.761
I command you!
Vanquish them with me!

59:03.920 --> 59:05.763
What the fuck? Sir!

59:05.920 --> 59:07.809
What the--
what the fuck? Sir?

59:07.960 --> 59:10.566
- Wait wait wait, hold on, hold on.
- You didn't listen!

59:10.720 --> 59:12.848
- Hold on, man.
- Oh no. What?

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.924
It is our time now...

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.206
Stand up.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:22.603
--And give your bodies to him.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.882
What?

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.409
- As we approach these final steps.
- No, you can't do this.

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:34.003
Know that we will soon
bask in his embrace.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.371
Fuck.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:43.651
What the fuck is going on?

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:48.647
Rejoice, child,
the time has cometh.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.725
Hey!

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:58.049
- Stop! Stop!

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.931
Oh fuck. Fuck!

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.810
Virgins, angels,

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.691
all your desires--

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.209
He shall provide.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:26.562
Until we meet again, my brothers.

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.810
Let us say goodbye
as we close this prayer.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.008
Lena?

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.005
-Lena?
-Amen.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.323
Amen.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.211
No no no no!

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:49.851
- Hey!

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.843
Fuck, man!

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.243
Amen.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.843
Holy shit!

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.404
Take his arms.

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.404
--Bring him here.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.484
- Oh fuck!

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.290
- Help me!

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:55.169
- Shit!

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.561
Help me.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.048
No, please don't!

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.725
Don't move, sir!

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.487
Adam, run. Go find her!

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.529
Please be patient, sir.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.640
- No, please!
- I said be patient, sir!

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:15.880
Go!

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.485
I'm sorry, man.

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:30.610
It has been an honor to meet you, sir.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.531
--Whoa. What...

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.411
the fuck?

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.964
Oh shit.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.006
The day has come,
He will be here soon...

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.769
Fuck!

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.126
Wait!

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:14.049
Our time has come!

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.409
Everything is ready.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.689
The day has come,
awake is the promised one.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:26.205
You don't need that anymore, son.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.528
It is... fulfilled.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.447
Fu--

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:44.841
oh fuck! Shit.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.562
-Lena!
-Adam!

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.722
--Fuck you, bitch!

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.443
- Bitch!

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:37.167
Okay okay.

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.771
- Fuck.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:44.809
Okay, Lena, calm down.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.371
I'm here, I'm here.
Come on.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:50.121
Get it the fuck out of me!

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:52.442
Get it... out of me!

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.448
--Oh!

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.570
Oh shit.

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.444
What the--

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.322
- Joni!

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.562
- Oh fuck! Joni--

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:04.081
Aw fuck, no!

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.563
- Oh Jesus!

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.524
Get the fuck--

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.569
Go!

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.604
--Oh fuck!

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.770
Oh!

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.807
What the fuck?

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.251
--Fuck.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.810
--Oh fuck!

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:05.849
- Shit!

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:14.247
Oh shit!

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.486
--No.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.964
No. No no no!

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:47.442
Fuck!

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:58.965
Oh, fuck.

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.405
What the fuck?

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:05.323
--Come on!

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.290
God help me, come on!
Oh shit!

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.203
--Oh fuck!

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.601
Fuck!Fuck!

01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.489
--Fuck!

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.001
Fuck!

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.202
Oh fuck, oh fuck.

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:21.523
Come On, come On, come On,
come On, come On.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:35.763
Fuck.Fuck.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.966
Papa.

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.247
Hey, baby, so I got you
both aspirin and ibuprofen

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.925
because I figured--

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.041
Oh no.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.446
Help!

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.364
Somebody help me!

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.201
Why did you do this?

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.123
Oh oh.

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.686
Come taste the flesh

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:52.968
of our slaughtered beast,
Earth creature.

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.930
Yeah, so we can eat
your body and collect your skin suit.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:59.607
Aha! You fell
for our trap, Earth fool.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.888
Now you will be
our delicious murder.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.162
Quick, put him
in my digestive container

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.368
so I can feed off of his life juice.

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:08.363
--What the fuck?

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.170
Put that dog down, Rattlebox.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.130
You keep feeding him
raw hot dogs, he's gonna get sick.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.409
I don't want to be the one pulling
tapeworms out of our dog's behind.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.449
- Oh, Tank.
- Ass worms.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.642
-Are you guys filming this?
-Affirmative.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.928
Good. Then we got it on tape
that you got your chores.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.366
- What about Jenn?
- No.

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:26.483
She's got an exam to study for

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.642
and I want you two
to leave her alone.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.087
You know in 20 minutes
Zack's gonna roll up in here, right?

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.561
Guys, look after Tank.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.131
Okay?

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.049
Your mother loves you.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.801
- Good job, Tank.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.129
Good buddy.

01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.443
-Right on time.
-Where's Jenn?

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.329
- She's in her room studying.
- What? I can't hear you.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.448
- She's in her fucking room.
- I can't fuckin' hear over this radio.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.165
- What the hell?

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:05.970
- You say she was in her room?
- Yeah.

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:07.326
Oh, perfect.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.810
What the fuck, Gary?

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.164
What the hell took
you guys so long?

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:16.681
We fuckin' lost our baseball game.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.330
- 'Cause you guys suck.
- You suck.

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.925
So what's up for today?

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:22.162
Oh yeah.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:24.163
We got some shit planned.

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.846
My sister and all her friends
are out back. Let's go.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:29.122
- Let's make it rain!
- Your sister's friend hot?

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.327
Yes.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.091
Hey, who wants
some of Daddy's beer?

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.925
--Your sister's gonna be so pissed.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:41.128
Yeah, she's probably gonna
shit out her vag.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:42.361
Gross.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.602
Hey, Randy, are you ready
to get your sister wet?

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.808
--Fuck off, dude. Don't film my dick.

01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:53.561
Ready, aim,

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.087
- fire!
- Oh my God!

01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.525
- Oh my God!
- Yeah!

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:01.091
Get drenched!

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.203
Assholes!
Seriously, get outta here!

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.681
- Go, you fucking twerps!
- Fuckers!

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.728
I'm gonna break your backs,
you little shits!

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.843
Taste my hot love, lover boy.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.082
Oh fuck!

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.526
Fuck!

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:20.728
Son of a bitches! Stop!

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:23.281
- Get him!

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.442
- Fuck you!
Hilarious!

01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:27.802
-See you tomorrow.
-Get the fuck back here!

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.042
Get me out
of this fucking cage!

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.089
See you later, biatch.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.766
Whoa!
Come back here, you bitch!

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.160
Holy shit, your sister's hot.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.288
Fuck off. So is your mom.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.329
Danny, what are you doing?

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.051
Are they actually doing it?

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.487
They are, I bet you.

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.568
Holy crap, they are doing it.
Let's ruin their fuckin' party.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:13.445
All right, hit it.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.921
- Yeah!

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.686
- Yeah!

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.402
Get out, Randy!
Get out!

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.006
Babies making babies!
Babies making babies!

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.885
Oh fuck!
Get out, Randy! Get out!

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.765
- Babies making babies!
- Gary!

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.406
- That's it!
- Whoa.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.166
--I'm gonna fucking rip your dicks off!

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.924
Turn off the light!

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.605
- Go go go!
- Get back here!

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.007
- Oh my God, that was so lame.
- Turn off the light,

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.128
- turn off the light. Oh shit.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:57.523
I tasted your piss,
now I'm gonna taste your fucking blood!

01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.727
- Do you guys see that?

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.125
What the fuck is that?

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.368
I don't know.
It kinda looks like a gravity--

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.568
Give me that fucking camera!

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:09.882
Let him the fuck go,
you piece of shit!

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.287
Are you fucking kidding me, Randy?
You want to fight right now?

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.363
Oh stop it! Fuck off, Randy!
Why are you such an asshole?

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.329
-I didn't have a shirt on!
-Calm down, it's not even a big deal.

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.323
-Are you serious?
-You were supposed to be studying,

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.606
-not slam hogging.
-Oh, shut it, Gary.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:22.730
And if I can't fucking erase this film,
I'm gonna fucking smash this camera.

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:24.922
You're bunch of fucking faggots.
You can suck my dick.

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.206
I don't want to!

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.726
Put it down, Zack. Put it back.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:34.009
This is it. I fucking
got you now, you piece of shit.

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:35.605
- What the fuck?

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.047
- What is it? What's he doing?
- Oh fuck!

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.804
-He's fucking spankin' it.
-He's what?

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.644
-He's stretching his dick.
-Oh my God.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.165
- He's jerking off.
- Oh God.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.089
- This is it.
- That's disgusting.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:47.965
No, this is it, Jenn. This is it.
This is how we get that fucker back.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.201
Shh. Stay still, Tank.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.283
Is this how they do it?

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.408
Yeah yeah,
I think--I think it's good.

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.325
Just--we got to get in there
before he lubes up that sleeping bag.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.720
So disgusting.

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.524
Come on, it's good.
Let's just do this. Come on.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.206
Okay.
Help me get him down.

01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.409
Go see Randy.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.442
Tank, go, get out of here.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.482
Oh fuck!
Tank, come back!

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.165
--Shh.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.806
Well, if it isn't Randy Handy
the fucking hand job.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.962
Caught you sticky-handed,
you little come-dick.

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:30.168
-"Come-dick"?
-Jenn, you'll ruin my life.

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.288
- Please give me the camera.
- Yeah right.

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:34.249
I'm putting this all over the Internet.

01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:35.890
- What's going on in here?
- Oh, nothing.

01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:38.208
We just caught your friend
milking his dick in here.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.010
You were coming
while we were sleeping?

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:43.846
- Fuck you and fuck you!

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.447
- Holy shit.
- What the heck?

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:54.007
What's going on?

01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:58.481
There's someone at your door.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.290
- What the...?

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.808
Where does your dad
keep his gun?

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:06.166
In the closet.

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.362
Oh my God. Oh my God.

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.850
Please tell me this is you guys.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.048
- No, it's fucking not, Randy.
- It's okay. Shh.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.288
Yeah, there's people
in front of our house.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:17.488
They just cut the power.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:19.881
Highway 103--1967.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.923
-Shh.
-Okay, hurry.

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.162
Stop playing around!

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.800
Show your faces before I blow 'em off!

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:28.849
- Zack!

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.321
- Shh!
- Zack!

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.404
Shit!
Give me that strobe light, Gary.

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.050
Zack!

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.884
Oh God. Oh God.

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.168
I think I want to go home.

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.641
- Did you guys hear that?
- Yeah, I did.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.122
- Jenn, did you hear that?
- Hear what?

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:52.809
- Gary!

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:57.411
--Gary!

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.086
Help! Hel--

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:02.607
let me out! Hey!

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:04.285
Hey hey!

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.129
- Help! Help me!

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:15.729
Jenn, help! Help!

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.882
- Jenn, help!

01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.606
- Help, Jenn, help!

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:22.921
Help.

01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.560
- Help help!

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.810
Gary!

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.530
- Do you see him?
- I can't see anything.

01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:40.728
- Come here, Tank.
