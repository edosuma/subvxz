WEBVTT

00:07.966 --> 00:09.968
- Vicki. Vicki, come in!

00:10.010 --> 00:12.012
Vicki.
[indistinct]

00:12.053 --> 00:12.929
[in Russian accent]
- This is fun.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.723
Where are we going?

00:14.764 --> 00:17.017
- Vicki! Vicki!

00:17.058 --> 00:18.059
Vicki, come in!

00:18.101 --> 00:19.394
Vicki, do you copy?

00:19.436 --> 00:21.187
Shit, her signal's dead.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.356
- Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

00:23.398 --> 00:26.151
Okay, Checkers,
looks like Vicki is forcing us

00:26.192 --> 00:27.569
to go with plan B.

00:27.610 --> 00:29.112
And I'm not talking about
the morning-after pill,

00:29.154 --> 00:31.698
which I have used several times
after one night stands

00:31.740 --> 00:33.867
and a few times
with long-term relationships

00:33.908 --> 00:34.909
in which I just wasn't ready

00:34.951 --> 00:36.244
to make that kind
of commitment yet.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.246
But no, the other plan B,

00:38.288 --> 00:40.123
an alternate plan to plan A,

00:40.165 --> 00:41.875
which Vicki just
fucking torpedoed

00:41.916 --> 00:43.126
like a Russian U-boat.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.336
- Right.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.587
- Ooh, driving fast.

00:45.628 --> 00:46.880
- Got her.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.506
They're in a black SUV
heading east on Bayshore.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.925
- Shit, Checkers,
meet at the Miata, stat!

00:50.967 --> 00:53.928
[dramatic music]

00:53.970 --> 00:58.141
* *

00:58.183 --> 01:00.769
Vicky, Vicky, do you copy?

01:00.810 --> 01:02.020
Do you copy?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.229
Vicky, do you copy?

01:03.271 --> 01:04.314
- Oh, thank God.
[coughs]

01:04.356 --> 01:06.107
I copy.
[clears throat]

01:06.149 --> 01:07.442
[in Russian accent]
Sorry, I just

01:07.484 --> 01:08.818
have to clear my throat.

01:08.860 --> 01:09.903
- Oh, gotcha, Vicki!

01:09.944 --> 01:11.529
Okay, look, we lost your 20.

01:11.571 --> 01:14.699
So any information you could
sneak us would be a big help.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.245
- [clears throat]
* Going down the street *

01:19.287 --> 01:21.623
* Going straight,
straight, straight *

01:21.664 --> 01:25.543
* And left, left, left,
and straight again *

01:25.585 --> 01:27.212
- Keep it down back there.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.463
[in Russian accent]
- Sorry.

01:28.505 --> 01:31.591
I get carsick
if I don't sing to myself

01:31.633 --> 01:33.385
in an American accent.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.761
- Doing a great job, Vick.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.847
But can you give us
anything more specific?

01:37.889 --> 01:39.307
- [rapping]
* The road's got a lump *

01:39.349 --> 01:40.767
* And a bump
and a thumpity-thump *

01:40.809 --> 01:43.812
* And we hit
a gravel patch, y'all *

01:43.853 --> 01:45.939
* So I think
it's only natural *

01:45.980 --> 01:48.775
* To assume we're off
the main road *

01:48.817 --> 01:49.901
- Gravel road?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.111
She must've left downtown.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.320
- All right,
that's great, Vick.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.947
You're in
silver medal territory,

01:53.988 --> 01:56.032
but we're going for the gold.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.409
- Got it.
[clears throat]

01:57.450 --> 02:00.495
* And when you cross
the train tracks *

02:00.537 --> 02:03.665
* And you hear
that crunching metal *

02:03.707 --> 02:09.254
* That's the end of the road
for us *

02:09.295 --> 02:11.131
* Us *

02:11.172 --> 02:12.173
[tires squeak]

02:12.215 --> 02:14.217
* 'Cause we stopped *

02:14.259 --> 02:15.176
- I know where she is.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.302
- Nice, Checkers.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.013
Vicki, we're on our way.

02:18.054 --> 02:22.392
* *

02:22.434 --> 02:23.601
- There's only one
active rail line

02:23.643 --> 02:25.061
near the old wrecking yard.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.896
This has to be the place.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.858
* *

02:29.899 --> 02:30.942
Bingo.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.736
They must've already
taken her inside.

02:32.777 --> 02:34.029
- Shit!

02:34.070 --> 02:35.363
All right, Checkers.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.032
Time to pump the bump.

02:37.073 --> 02:40.243
- MacGruber, we have no idea
what we're up against in there.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.828
I think it's time
to call the cavalry.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.538
- Checkers...

02:43.580 --> 02:46.833
we are the fucking cavalry.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.253
I overextended it. Hang on.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.921
Let me get the key in here.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.883
[dramatic music]

02:54.924 --> 03:01.890
* *

03:14.361 --> 03:19.199
- * MacGruber *

03:19.240 --> 03:22.243
[fire crackles]

03:22.285 --> 03:23.912
[dark ominous music]

03:23.953 --> 03:24.996
- [gasps]

03:25.038 --> 03:26.873
- Dr. Poliskaya.
- [sighs]

03:26.915 --> 03:29.668
- It is a pleasure
to finally meet you.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.129
- [with Russian accent]
And a very pleasure

03:33.171 --> 03:35.924
to meet you, Mr.

03:35.965 --> 03:39.302
- I've been such a fan of yours
since Oslo.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.473
- [laughs nervously]
Oslo.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.187
Well, we should probably
get to work.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.356
- Great.
Let me show you to the lab.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.318
- Vicki, we made it inside.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.487
Look, this may be
your last chance.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.656
We can provide cover fire,
okay?

03:59.698 --> 04:02.450
So just make a break for it
and head for us.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.869
We're roughly, like,
10 feet above you, right?

04:04.911 --> 04:07.330
At your, like, 7:00 a.m.
Pacific Standard Time.

04:07.372 --> 04:08.998
No, no, no, no, no,
like, 6:00 a.m.?

04:09.040 --> 04:11.668
So 7:00 a.m.
Mountain Standard Time.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.169
No, Checkers,
would you say this is 7:00?

04:13.211 --> 04:14.421
- We're upstairs.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.297
- Checkers, don't confuse her!

04:16.339 --> 04:18.091
Vicki, I am so sorry about him.

04:18.133 --> 04:21.469
So, like, 7:00-ish
and maybe 12 feet.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.096
[static whines]
Wait, wait, wait, Vicki!

04:23.138 --> 04:25.181
Vicki, Vicki, Vicki, Vicki!

04:25.223 --> 04:27.267
Vicki, Vicki, Vicki, Vicki!

04:27.308 --> 04:29.144
Vicki, Vicki, Vicki!

04:29.185 --> 04:30.895
Vicki, Vicki, Vicki!

04:30.937 --> 04:32.313
Vicki, Vicki, Vicki!

04:32.355 --> 04:33.606
Vicki, Vicki--shit!

04:33.648 --> 04:35.066
She turned off her ear thingy.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.234
Oh, no, damn it!

04:36.276 --> 04:37.360
Nice going, Checkers!

04:37.402 --> 04:38.653
- Sorry.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.988
- I think you'll find
that everything

04:40.030 --> 04:42.699
is exactly
to your specifications.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.075
- Yes.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.745
I very hope it's acceptable.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.372
- Mm-hmm.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.584
- Ah, little refrigerator.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.877
[alarm beeping]

04:53.918 --> 04:56.504
Nope. Hmm.
Something else.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.007
- [chuckles]

04:59.049 --> 05:02.302
- These are good for looking
at small things.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.554
- Mm-hmm.

05:04.596 --> 05:08.350
- Use a lot of cabinets
for my...

05:08.391 --> 05:10.185
tubes.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.354
Ah, this is...

05:12.395 --> 05:14.022
missing, um, s--

05:14.064 --> 05:15.732
oh!

05:15.774 --> 05:17.567
There it is.
[laughs]

05:17.609 --> 05:18.985
[tense music]

05:19.027 --> 05:22.364
Then I guess we are,
as you say,

05:22.405 --> 05:26.534
very...set to jet.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.370
- Shit. What's the play here?

05:28.411 --> 05:29.788
What's the fucking play?

05:29.829 --> 05:31.289
- Maybe we just stand down.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.582
It looks like it's working.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.542
- What happens
when she destroys Brimstone?

05:34.584 --> 05:35.669
They'll kill her!

05:35.710 --> 05:36.961
- I know this is difficult,

05:37.003 --> 05:39.923
but like you said,
Vicki's a soldier.

05:39.964 --> 05:41.216
This is her call.

05:41.257 --> 05:48.181
* *

05:48.223 --> 05:49.224
- No!

05:49.265 --> 05:50.392
- MacGruber!

05:50.433 --> 05:52.977
Where are you going?

05:53.019 --> 05:54.396
Shit.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.440
- So where is the item?

05:57.482 --> 05:59.234
- I thought you'd never ask.

05:59.275 --> 06:02.237
[dramatic music]

06:02.278 --> 06:08.868
* *

06:08.910 --> 06:10.620
- [gasps]

06:26.386 --> 06:28.430
- Freeze!

06:28.471 --> 06:29.639
Make one more move

06:29.681 --> 06:31.474
and I'll blow
your fucking hands off

06:31.516 --> 06:33.435
and then use
the remaining bullets

06:33.476 --> 06:34.936
to explode your fucking head!

06:34.978 --> 06:37.939
Put your fucking hands up,
woman!

06:37.981 --> 06:41.276
And not a move
from anyone else.

06:41.317 --> 06:44.863
Hello, Lon, Baker, Bex,

06:44.904 --> 06:47.907
other assorted pieces
of fucking shit.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.410
That woman is not
who you think she is.

06:50.452 --> 06:54.831
She's not a Russian scientist,
but rather an American soldier.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.791
- That man is insane.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.086
He does not know
what he's talking about.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.756
- Her sole intention is
to get ahold of Brimstone

07:02.797 --> 07:03.965
and destroy it.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.425
And unless you want that
to happen,

07:05.467 --> 07:07.969
you will do exactly as I say.

07:08.011 --> 07:12.307
Now, Lon, slowly raise your gun
and point it at Vicki's head.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.351
* *

07:14.392 --> 07:15.977
Point your gun at her head

07:16.019 --> 07:18.480
or I will shoot her
in the head!

07:18.521 --> 07:21.149
Slowly. Good boy.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.442
Nice job.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.486
Now, if she so much as breathes

07:24.527 --> 07:26.071
in the direction
of that canister,

07:26.112 --> 07:28.531
you empty those clips into her,
all right?

07:28.573 --> 07:31.659
- [whimpers]
- Hang on. BRB.

07:31.701 --> 07:36.164
* *

07:36.206 --> 07:38.208
- [gasps]

07:38.249 --> 07:39.167
All right.
- Jesus.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.335
- Yeah, yeah.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.379
What's this here, you wonder.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.006
This is
the real Irina Poliskaya!

07:45.048 --> 07:47.592
Yeah, we were able
to switch her out at the hotel.

07:47.634 --> 07:50.720
And you dumb pieces of shit
had no idea.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.807
Yeah, we fucking pwned you
so hard.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.309
Now I propose a little trade.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.520
So what do you say,
you wanna let Vicki go?

07:58.561 --> 08:00.355
Continue Queeth's evil plan?

08:00.397 --> 08:02.315
Or you wanna kill Vicki

08:02.357 --> 08:05.026
and make me kill Irina
and probably most of you,

08:05.068 --> 08:07.237
and then everyone's gotta go
to a bunch of funerals?

08:07.278 --> 08:10.448
- How do we know
she's the real scientist?

08:10.490 --> 08:12.283
- Say some fucking
science shit.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.994
- Weaponizing the compounds

08:15.036 --> 08:17.706
depends on the practical
aerosolization,

08:17.747 --> 08:22.210
which is synthesis
of exactly 0.74

08:22.252 --> 08:23.795
microns per million.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.380
- Checks out.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.716
- Now you go.

08:27.757 --> 08:32.429
- Cooking an egg is a science.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.890
Folding towels is a science.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.727
- Okay, you can have her.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.104
Send over
the real scientist first.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.439
- No fucking way!

08:42.480 --> 08:44.941
You send Vicki first,
then I send the scientist.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.235
- No deal.
- Fuck!

08:47.277 --> 08:49.279
Okay, same timesies?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.823
- Fine, but if anything
funny happens...

08:51.865 --> 08:53.408
[cocks gun]
She's dead.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.952
- You took the words
right out of my mouth.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.996
I mean, I was literally
about to say,

08:58.038 --> 09:00.707
"If anything funny happens,
the scientist dies."

09:00.749 --> 09:02.625
I mean, it's not exactly
the same, but same gist.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.377
- Let's get on with this!

09:04.419 --> 09:06.838
- Okay, so, ladies,
let's start walking

09:06.880 --> 09:10.425
in three, two, one.

09:10.467 --> 09:11.593
Walk.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.470
- He said, "Walk."

09:13.511 --> 09:16.431
[suspenseful music]

09:16.473 --> 09:17.807
* *

09:17.849 --> 09:19.309
- [in American accent]
You don't have to do this.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.268
- Go to hell.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.103
- [gasps]
Eat a toilet sandwich!

09:22.145 --> 09:23.480
- What?
- I don't know.

09:23.521 --> 09:26.399
- Run, Vicki!
[gunfire]

09:29.110 --> 09:30.612
[screaming]

09:30.653 --> 09:31.613
Vicki, stay down!

09:31.654 --> 09:32.697
You're safe now!

09:32.739 --> 09:37.118
* *

09:37.160 --> 09:38.370
[gun clicking]
Oh, oh, oh!

09:38.411 --> 09:41.039
Checkers, Checkers,
we're out of ammo!

09:41.081 --> 09:42.248
Where the hell are you?

09:43.833 --> 09:46.753

You could learn something

Yeah, that was fun.

Maybe you are just a housewife.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.832
and they did--

13:52.874 --> 13:55.669
I defended you.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.171
So maybe I was wrong about you.

13:58.213 --> 14:01.132
Maybe you have lost it.

Queeth destroyed my father.

You gotta help me stop him.

about your family.

But if you love this country
as much as you say you do,

14:48.638 --> 14:50.598
you'll go to Fasoose
and tell him everything.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.392

doing that.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.382
[solemn music]

20:57.424 --> 20:59.384
I thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

21:03.430 --> 21:07.058
[handcuffs jingling]

21:07.100 --> 21:08.268
Let's just call it even.

21:08.309 --> 21:11.521
* *

21:11.563 --> 21:13.398
- Sir, I'm so sorry.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.817
I'd never forgive myself
if I didn't ask, though.

21:15.859 --> 21:18.653
Is there any way
I can be of service?

21:18.695 --> 21:20.405
- MacGruber--
- Look, I know I've been

21:20.447 --> 21:21.823
a bit of a loose cannon.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.575
But what if I was
a tight cannon?

21:23.616 --> 21:25.410
Operating under your command

21:25.452 --> 21:27.537
in whatever capacity
you see fit.

21:27.579 --> 21:29.330
Hell, I'd take you
to the fucking prom

21:29.372 --> 21:30.540
if it helped bring down Queeth.

21:30.582 --> 21:32.042
- I'm sorry, Mac.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.588
- Fuck!

21:36.629 --> 21:38.923
* *

21:38.965 --> 21:40.425
You have any idea
what it's like

21:40.467 --> 21:42.135
to see
your mother's brains splatter

21:42.177 --> 21:44.679
all over your face and cake?

21:44.721 --> 21:46.765
Or what it's like
to come back from deployment

21:46.806 --> 21:49.476
to find your dad giving
hand jobs to crack dealers

21:49.517 --> 21:52.062
for his next crack rock?

21:52.103 --> 21:54.731
Queeth fucking broke us!

21:54.773 --> 21:57.025
[sobbing]
He broke us.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.236
Please!

22:00.278 --> 22:02.364
I'm begging you!

22:02.405 --> 22:05.200
I am fucking begging you.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.035
Please.

22:07.077 --> 22:10.080
[sobbing]

22:11.956 --> 22:14.209
[screams]

22:14.250 --> 22:21.132
* *

22:23.426 --> 22:24.844
I'll jack you off.

22:24.886 --> 22:26.513
Just right here.

22:26.554 --> 22:27.972
You can come on my face.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.641
All right?
Is that what you want?

22:29.683 --> 22:30.850
Then I want it too.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.102
All right, come on, please.

22:32.143 --> 22:34.020
[spits]
Come on, please.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.105
Come on me.

22:35.146 --> 22:36.314
Come on my face.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.608
Come on my face.

22:38.650 --> 22:40.944
- Hi, General!
- Hey, yeah! Hey, Jerry.

22:40.985 --> 22:42.737
- Why won't you
just come on me?

22:42.779 --> 22:44.614
- Good to see you. Good night.

22:44.656 --> 22:46.616
- [sobbing]

22:46.658 --> 22:48.952
I'm begging you!

22:48.993 --> 22:50.412
- Get up, Mac.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.747
[ominous music]

22:52.789 --> 22:54.582
You didn't get those from me.

22:54.624 --> 22:58.753
* *

22:58.795 --> 23:00.296
- Queeth's location?

23:00.338 --> 23:01.673
- It's a dead zone, and yet,

23:01.715 --> 23:03.800
there's a persistent
heat signature that suggests

23:03.842 --> 23:06.928
the presence of anywhere
from 50 to 100 hostiles.

23:06.970 --> 23:10.140
Tomorrow, we've scheduled
a drone strike at 2100 hours.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.686
That's 9:00 p.m.
- 9:00 p.m., yep!

23:14.728 --> 23:16.771
Yes, yes. 9:00 p.m.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.606
Prime time.
- Sure, whatever.

23:18.648 --> 23:21.067
Listen, Mac, if you get
yourself in there,

23:21.109 --> 23:22.777
Queeth's almost
as good as yours.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.738
But that strike is gonna happen
no matter what.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.949
We are not going to risk
Queeth escaping a second time.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.117
You hear me?

23:29.159 --> 23:31.327
- I don't know what to say,
General.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.038
But if I did...

23:33.079 --> 23:35.373
probably sound a lot like
thank you.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.792
- After everything that you've
done for our country,

23:37.834 --> 23:40.462
the least we can do
is offer you a chance

23:40.503 --> 23:42.464
to get some closure.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.299
- I won't let you down.

23:44.341 --> 23:46.301
[dramatic music]

[sighs]

24:50.281 --> 24:51.658
[gasps]

24:51.700 --> 24:53.034
- Hello, Vicki.

24:53.076 --> 24:55.036
- MacGruber, you shouldn't be--
- Vicki, wait.

24:55.078 --> 24:56.996
There are a few things
I need to get off my chest,

24:57.038 --> 24:58.748
and I don't have much time.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.376
- I'm listening.

25:01.418 --> 25:03.670
- I need you to know...

25:03.712 --> 25:05.547
that I'm sorry.

25:05.588 --> 25:06.881
I mean, the only reason

25:06.923 --> 25:08.925
that I lied about you in court

25:08.967 --> 25:12.220
was 'cause I wanted you there
in prison with me.

25:12.262 --> 25:15.223
Because I didn't know
how to live without you.

25:15.265 --> 25:17.767
- [sighs]

25:17.809 --> 25:19.561
- There are so many things
I wish I could change

25:19.602 --> 25:21.688
about the past, but I can't.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.356
You're not my property.

25:23.398 --> 25:24.983
Not anymore.

25:26.401 --> 25:27.610
- Thank you for saying that.

25:27.652 --> 25:29.279
- We had an electric love.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.072
But that was years ago.

25:31.114 --> 25:33.074
And I'm so happy
that you've moved on

25:33.116 --> 25:34.576
and found new love
with Barrett.

25:34.617 --> 25:36.202
- I have moved on.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.580
And I'm happy
that you've realized that.

25:38.621 --> 25:39.998
- I do.
- I mean, it's not like

25:40.040 --> 25:41.624
I think about you every night
and pine for your touch.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.126
- No.

25:43.168 --> 25:44.627
- Staring
into my husband's eyes

25:44.669 --> 25:46.296
wishing they were yours.

25:46.338 --> 25:48.840
Kissing him and imagining
your perfect lips

25:48.882 --> 25:50.967
and tongue dancing with mine...

25:51.009 --> 25:54.054
flicking, groping, asking...

25:54.095 --> 25:55.930
answering.
- Of course not.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.892
- Tongues intertwined, twisted,

25:58.933 --> 26:01.811
coiled liked two serpents.

26:01.853 --> 26:03.938
Like the two snakes
on that medical doctor symbol.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.106
- I don't know that one.

26:05.148 --> 26:06.816
- When I'm intimate
with my husband,

26:06.858 --> 26:08.985
I do not yearn
for your sharp scent.

26:09.027 --> 26:09.986
- No.

26:10.028 --> 26:11.446
- I don't close my eyes

26:11.488 --> 26:13.448
and trace Barrett's testicles
with my tongue,

26:13.490 --> 26:16.284
remembering every wrinkle
and pimple on yours.

26:16.326 --> 26:18.036
- No.
- And I don't round the horn

26:18.078 --> 26:20.622
with my mouth and nose,
hoping to helplessly fall down

26:20.663 --> 26:22.123
your rabbit hole like...

26:22.165 --> 26:24.501
Alice in the looking glass,
forgetting myself,

26:24.542 --> 26:26.127
forgetting everything,

26:26.169 --> 26:28.046
becoming at once
tiny and giant,

26:28.088 --> 26:30.465
losing myself in your musky,

26:30.507 --> 26:32.926
damp, verdant...

26:32.967 --> 26:34.719
life-giving earth.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.179
- You don't do
any of those things.

26:36.221 --> 26:37.430
- I feel free.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.557
I'm so happy that you feel
that same freedom.

26:39.599 --> 26:40.892
- Praise be.
- Amen.

26:40.934 --> 26:43.269
- Now before I go,

26:43.311 --> 26:45.397
there's something
I want you to have.

26:47.065 --> 26:50.235
[soft sentimental music]

26:50.276 --> 26:53.029
- Your locket?

26:53.071 --> 26:55.740
- It's saved my life
countless times.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.200
Look inside.

26:57.242 --> 27:01.371
* *

27:01.413 --> 27:04.374
- Are these--
- Your pubic hairs?

27:04.416 --> 27:06.126
Yes.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.128
- MacGruber.

27:08.169 --> 27:10.171
- After the first night
we made love,

27:10.213 --> 27:13.341
I found a bunch of those
bad boys in your underpants.

27:13.383 --> 27:16.428
So one by one,
I plucked out the freshest,

27:16.469 --> 27:19.222
and I bought that
beautiful locket to house them.

27:19.264 --> 27:22.267
I've worn that around my neck
ever since.

27:22.308 --> 27:26.062
Every time the world feels like
it's caving in around me,

27:26.104 --> 27:28.481
I just touch that locket,

27:28.523 --> 27:30.191
think about what's inside

27:30.233 --> 27:32.235
and the woman
they were attached to.

27:32.277 --> 27:33.528
- Me.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.071
- And I'm whole again.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.451
That's the power you have.

27:39.492 --> 27:41.077
You did that.

27:41.119 --> 27:42.162
You!

27:42.203 --> 27:43.163
[sniffs]

27:44.247 --> 27:47.751
But that locket,
that's not mine anymore.

27:47.792 --> 27:50.211
That's Barrett's locket now.

27:50.253 --> 27:52.047
And I want you
to give that to him

27:52.088 --> 27:54.090
and tell him the story
that I just told you

27:54.132 --> 27:56.760
word-for-word when you do.

27:58.428 --> 27:59.637
- I will.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.306
- Well...

28:03.767 --> 28:06.227
Smell you later, Vick.

28:06.269 --> 28:09.731
And I mean that
with every fiber of my being.

28:09.773 --> 28:12.692
I will smell you later.

28:12.734 --> 28:19.824

28:51.147 --> 28:53.316
Hope you motherfuckers
are ready.

28:53.358 --> 28:56.236
'Cause MacGruber's coming
for you.

28:56.277 --> 28:57.737
Later today.

28:57.779 --> 28:58.988
Or, uh, tonight.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.990
Night's probably better.
Probably tonight.

29:01.032 --> 29:03.159
Probably tonight.
