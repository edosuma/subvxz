00:09.260 --> 00:10.970
It's 7:00 in the morning...

00:11.179 --> 00:14.682
<i>...and Gotham City is rubbing
the sleep out of its eyes...</i>

00:14.891 --> 00:16.976
<i>...preparing to meet the new day.</i>

00:17.185 --> 00:20.688
<i>But in the studios of KGC-TV...</i>

00:20.897 --> 00:25.151
<i>...Harry Upps has his morning show
already in progress.</i>

00:25.360 --> 00:28.613
And one of the primary functions
of the Wayne Foundation Fund...

00:28.821 --> 00:33.368
...is to support and supplement
local recreational activities.

00:33.576 --> 00:38.206
We believe that through physical fitness
and organized sport...

00:38.414 --> 00:41.668
...we can help the youth of Gotham City
help themselves.

00:41.876 --> 00:44.087
That's very admirable, Mr. Wayne.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.381
Your foundation is doing marvelous work.

00:46.589 --> 00:48.841
Now, if you'll pardon me
for just 60 seconds.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.843
- A word from the sponsor?
-Exactly.

00:51.052 --> 00:55.765
There wouldn't be a highly-rated <i>Harry</i> Upps
Morning Show without the sponsors.

00:56.432 --> 00:59.102
Friends, the rainy season
is almost upon us...

00:59.310 --> 01:01.688
...and if you ever get caught
in the downpour...

01:01.896 --> 01:04.232
...just reach for a Stay-Dry Umbrella.

01:04.440 --> 01:08.069
Stay-Dry has been making umbrellas
for 64 years now.

01:08.278 --> 01:12.198
I, um-- I know that it's supposed to be bad luck
to open an umbrella indoors...

01:12.407 --> 01:14.617
...but, heh, heh, I'll take that chance...

01:14.826 --> 01:17.495
...because I'd like you to see
the beautiful workmanship...

01:17.704 --> 01:19.664
...that goes into this Stay-Dry Umbrella.

01:21.291 --> 01:22.333

01:34.971 --> 01:37.682
Looks like Harry Upps has lost his voice.

01:38.850 --> 01:41.603
This may be the work
of one of our archenemies.

01:41.811 --> 01:46.566
But which one? An umbrella usually means
the Penguin's waddling around somewhere.

01:47.025 --> 01:50.778
And this is a riddle:
"What's black and white and full of fuzz?"

01:50.987 --> 01:55.283
- Zebra, zebra, zebra?
-No, a squad car.

01:55.491 --> 01:57.827
Yes, speaking of squad cars...

01:58.036 --> 02:01.205
...Commissioner Gordon
always watches this program.

02:01.414 --> 02:04.042
He should be calling us any second.

02:10.381 --> 02:12.342
Are we on the air?

02:14.761 --> 02:17.263
Due to circumstances
beyond anyone's control...

02:17.472 --> 02:21.059
...we now switch you to our midday movie:

02:22.060 --> 02:24.771
<i>The Big Green Thing
That Devoured Pittsburgh.</i>

02:26.356 --> 02:28.941
I'm sorry, sir, he's not here at the moment.

02:29.150 --> 02:32.070
Uh, taking his morning constitutional, I fancy.

02:32.278 --> 02:35.239
Oh, begging your pardon, sir,
here is Batman now.

02:35.448 --> 02:38.284
Yes, you're calling about
what happened on the morning show.

02:38.493 --> 02:43.373
- Why, <i>yes, how did you know?
- I viewed the entire affair.</i>

02:43.581 --> 02:47.126
A criminal has to get up pretty
early in the morning to outwit you, Batman.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.754
<i>Check on the location
of Joker, Riddler and Penguin.</i>

02:49.962 --> 02:53.007
We'll meet you in your office
as soon as possible.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.803
To the Batpoles.

04:28.811 --> 04:30.396
It's really an ordinary umbrella...

04:30.605 --> 04:32.899
...with a mild electric shock device
build into the handle.

04:35.026 --> 04:38.029
Hardly enough to cause a man
to lose his speech.

04:38.237 --> 04:41.991
Well, he's not in any pain,
but he can't say a word for the life of him.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.994
A serious detriment for an announcer.

04:45.203 --> 04:48.539
Poor man has been checked
from toenails to tonsils but all to no avail.

04:48.748 --> 04:53.544
I think we should concentrate on who did it
rather than how it was done.

04:53.753 --> 04:55.671
Commissioner,
did you follow my suggestion?

04:55.880 --> 04:59.592
Indeed, Batman, but the Joker, the Riddler
and the Penguin are all three in jail.

04:59.801 --> 05:01.969
- Wasn't any of them.
-Hm. May we take this with us?

05:02.178 --> 05:03.513
Of course, by all means.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.890
Perhaps one of the instruments
in the Batcave...

05:06.098 --> 05:09.977
...may be able to shed some light
on this baffling puzzle.

05:10.186 --> 05:12.980
It's our only clue. Let's go, Robin.

05:17.401 --> 05:20.154
I don't believe there ever have been
or ever will be...

05:20.363 --> 05:22.782
...two such selfless people.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.744
Well, they've certainly made my job
a whole lot easier, commissioner.

05:26.953 --> 05:29.872
And mine. I think if I were to ask...

05:30.081 --> 05:32.875
...Batman would give me the cape
right off his back.

05:33.084 --> 05:34.126
What a man.

05:37.672 --> 05:39.257
Yes, Bonnie?

05:39.465 --> 05:43.135
Oh, by all means, yes, send her in.

05:45.680 --> 05:49.559
Hello, Commissioner Gordon, Chief O'Hara.

05:49.767 --> 05:52.562
Catwoman. Hello, hello, hello.

05:52.770 --> 05:55.898
- Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Eenie.
-Hi, commish.

05:56.107 --> 05:58.734
- Meanie, Miney and Moe.
-We're pleased to meet you.

05:58.943 --> 06:00.945
- Commissioner Gordon.
-And Chief O'Hara.

06:01.153 --> 06:04.574
I'm delighted to learn of your new venture
into the world of show business.

06:04.782 --> 06:08.035
- Oh, yes, and, you know...
-Ha, ha.

06:08.244 --> 06:11.956
...it's so much safer on this side of the law.

06:12.164 --> 06:15.877
Show business
is such a rewarding profession. Ha, ha.

06:16.085 --> 06:18.838
Ha-ha-ha.
Tell me, what do you call yourselves?

06:19.046 --> 06:22.425
Catwoman and the Kittens. Ha, ha!
Catchy.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.719
- Don't you think?
-Oh, yes, yes, quite.

06:24.927 --> 06:28.848
We'd love to have you perform at the
Police Benevolent Society Ball. Will you?

06:29.056 --> 06:31.851
With the greatest of pleasure,
it'll be our debut.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.437
We'll put on a performance
you'll never forget.

06:34.645 --> 06:37.982
I categorically promise you that.

06:38.190 --> 06:41.402
Tell me, do Batman and Robin
know I've been sprung?

06:41.611 --> 06:44.322
Oh, dear, I had intended telling them...

06:44.530 --> 06:48.159
...but it completely slipped my mind
in the throes of this morning's incidents.

06:48.367 --> 06:53.748
Well, do me a favor, commissioner.
Let it be our secret for the nonce. Meow.

06:53.956 --> 06:58.169
Batman will learn about it soon enough.
Come on, kittens.

07:01.631 --> 07:04.508
Goodbye, Commissioner Gordon,
Chief O'Hara.

07:04.717 --> 07:09.430
Until we meet again.
Here's a kiss to build a dream on.

07:11.891 --> 07:15.061
I just don't know, commissioner...

07:15.269 --> 07:19.065
...what with her being back in town
and all that commotion this morning.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.275
Do you suppose
she could be the cause of it?

07:21.484 --> 07:25.613
Oh, nonsense, Chief O'Hara,
I can tell a reformed woman when I see one.

07:25.821 --> 07:29.158
And there is a reformed woman.

07:31.285 --> 07:37.041
<i>NARRATOR". And in Catwoman's lair
adjoining Duncan's Dance Studio...</i>

07:37.667 --> 07:43.631
Yeow! Isn't it simply too delicious
for words? Ha, ha.

07:44.382 --> 07:46.842
Do you really think
we'll be able to get away with it?

07:47.051 --> 07:48.511
Of course we will.

07:48.719 --> 07:52.807
Didn't I snatch that silly announcer's voice
this morning without a hitch?

07:53.015 --> 07:55.768
Eenie, get me his voice.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.408
<i>I'll take that chance
because I would like you to see...</i>

08:10.616 --> 08:14.203
<i>...the beautiful workmanship that goes
into this Stay-Dry Umbrella.</i>

08:14.412 --> 08:16.706
<i>Please note the--</i>

08:16.914 --> 08:20.543
So where did it get us?
You risked getting caught just to pull a prank.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.253
Prank?

08:22.461 --> 08:26.799
Eenie, sometimes I think you left
your brain in San Francisco.

08:27.008 --> 08:29.760
I did it to take suspicion away from us.

08:29.969 --> 08:34.849
And set the wheels of justice
skidding in the wrong direction. Ha-ha-ha.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.393
When we complete this caper...

08:37.601 --> 08:41.355
...we're gonna have enough money
to keep us in catnip forever.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.819
Or else I'm gonna give the whole world
a severe case of permanent laryngitis.

08:47.028 --> 08:51.073
Fellas, are you sure that article
didn't mention where they're staying?

08:51.282 --> 08:53.617
-"The popular singing duo--"
-"Chad and Jeremy--"

08:53.826 --> 08:56.912
"Are coming to Gotham City to appear
at the Police Society Ball."

08:57.121 --> 08:59.040
"Due to anticipated rush of their fans--"

08:59.248 --> 09:01.917
"Accommodations for Chad and Jeremy
are being kept secret."

09:02.126 --> 09:04.462
Get the commissioner on the phone.

09:05.796 --> 09:11.218
Are you nuts? You ask him anything,
he'll suspect you for sure.

09:11.761 --> 09:13.804
Let's get something straight.

09:14.013 --> 09:18.225
Catwoman is top dog around here
and let's not forget it, Eenie.

09:21.937 --> 09:25.149
Hello, Catwoman, what can I do for you?

09:25.357 --> 09:29.695
You can tell me where Chad and Jeremy
are staying while they're here in Gotham City.

09:29.904 --> 09:35.242
Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.
It's top-secret information, very hush-hush.

09:35.451 --> 09:39.580
You don't trust me? I'm deeply hurt.

09:39.789 --> 09:43.292
I thought you, of all people,
would give solace to an ex-convict.

09:43.501 --> 09:45.878
Is there any particular reason
you want to know?

09:46.087 --> 09:49.590
I wanna make certain we won't perform
any of the same songs they will.

09:49.799 --> 09:52.968
You want this show to be a success,
don't you?

09:54.428 --> 09:55.930
Well, since you put it that way.

09:56.138 --> 09:59.892
They'll be at the home of millionaire
Bruce Wayne, stately Wayne Manor. But look:

10:00.101 --> 10:03.646
<i>You must promise
not to divulge this information to anyone.</i>

10:03.854 --> 10:09.235
I give you my word as a lady and a scholar.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.945
<i>Tell me, commissioner...</i>

10:11.153 --> 10:14.281
<i>...they call you the voice of authority
in Gotham City, do they not?</i>

10:14.490 --> 10:16.534
At times, yes, yes, why do you ask?

10:17.368 --> 10:22.039
And if you couldn't speak, it might severely
cripple your effectiveness, would it not?

10:22.248 --> 10:25.960
- What do you mean?
-Just say bye-bye, commissioner.

10:33.134 --> 10:35.970
No more pompous prattle from you.

10:50.651 --> 10:51.819
Hello?

10:52.027 --> 10:53.696
<i>You can win a free dance lesson...</i>

10:53.904 --> 10:57.449
...at the Duncan Dance Studios
if you answer this simple question.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.661
- Sorry, I'm not interested in dance lessons.
-Wait a minute, Dick.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.621
The junior prom's coming up, isn't it?

11:02.830 --> 11:05.791
- Yes, but--
-We don't want you to be a Wallflower, do we?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.378
Dancing is an integral part
of every young man's education.

11:09.587 --> 11:13.007
Gosh, Bruce, you're right, but dancing?

11:14.884 --> 11:19.805
- All right, miss, what's the question?
- Who painted Whistler's <i>Mother?</i>

11:20.014 --> 11:21.432
Why, Whistler, of course.

11:22.141 --> 11:25.144
Congratulations.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.272
- You mean, that's it?
-That's it.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.609
- When do I <i>get my lesson?
-I'll be right over.</i>

11:35.613 --> 11:38.699
Can you imagine that?
First time in my life I ever won anything.

11:38.908 --> 11:40.618
Heh. Congratulations.

11:40.826 --> 11:44.163
I have to go to the store to pick up
a tube for the Bat-sound analyzer...

11:44.371 --> 11:46.665
...we can't make a move without it.
Back in a hour.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.542
Okay.

11:50.127 --> 11:53.255
- One, two, three.
- Ow.

11:53.464 --> 11:56.467
Sorry. You'll get the hang of it.
You're doing just fine, fine.

11:56.675 --> 12:00.346
I don't think I'll ever learn to dance, Ms. Klutz.
I don't have natural rhythm.

12:00.554 --> 12:05.100
Balderdash. Ha, ha.
You'll pardon the expression, now...

12:11.106 --> 12:13.359
I'm a little out of breath.
Could we take a break?

12:13.567 --> 12:15.152
Certainly.

12:15.694 --> 12:20.324
Very nice place you have here, Master Grayson.
Very homey.

12:22.493 --> 12:27.581
Fourteen bathrooms, 18 bedrooms.

12:28.165 --> 12:31.543
- How many entrances are there to the place?
-Three.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.213
Why are you asking all these questions
about the house?

12:34.421 --> 12:38.384
You seem more interested in the layout of
Wayne Manor than giving me a dancing lesson.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.844
When I get through with you,
Master Grayson...

12:41.053 --> 12:43.347
...I'll have taught you one heck of a lesson.

12:46.058 --> 12:48.185
What are those things there?

12:49.103 --> 12:54.275
- Dogwood, why?
-Dog--? I am allergic to--

12:59.697 --> 13:02.366
Why, you're no dance teacher,
you're Catwoman.

13:02.574 --> 13:06.036
Oh! Mercy me.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.595

And at Gotham City Airport...</i>

13:23.804 --> 13:29.351
<i>...England's singing sensations,
Chad and Jeremy, are due to arrive.</i>

13:44.241 --> 13:47.619
- Have no fear.
-Chad and Jeremy are here.

13:48.537 --> 13:51.290
Oh, aren't they just the most
adorable twosome in the world?

13:51.498 --> 13:54.209
If you don't count Batman and Robin.

13:58.881 --> 14:02.968
- What do you think of the States so far?
- Do us a favor, we've been here two minutes.

14:03.177 --> 14:06.722
And sometimes it takes us as long as
half an hour to get to really know a country.

14:08.182 --> 14:10.559
- About that haircut of yours, Jeremy.
- What haircut?

14:10.768 --> 14:12.102
I haven't had a trim in weeks.

14:12.311 --> 14:15.606
Actually, he wears it that way
so people won't confuse him with his mom.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.232
Yeah, she's bald, poor thing.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.193
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

14:19.401 --> 14:22.071
What are your plans
after your appearance in Gotham City?

14:22.279 --> 14:23.697
We're going straight back home.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.533
We've gotta do a command
performance for the queen.

14:26.742 --> 14:30.704
<i>Respect
In hating an enemy</i>

14:30.913 --> 14:32.873
Catwoman.

14:33.082 --> 14:36.543
It's nice to see a responsible citizen
like you for a change.

14:36.752 --> 14:37.795
Thank you, sergeant.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.422
<i>Am I a living symbol of your youth?</i>

14:40.631 --> 14:44.593
Come on, kittens, let's get out of here.
Too many bluecoats for us to get away with it.

14:44.802 --> 14:46.095
Get away with what, Catwoman?

14:46.303 --> 14:50.307
- We still don't know your plan.
-You will, Eenie. Let's go.

14:50.516 --> 14:53.644
<i>Become clear
As you see me sitting there</i>

14:53.852 --> 14:56.522
- What is your favorite group?
-Oh. Chamber of commerce.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.858
- PTA, that sort of thing.
-Yes. Heh.

15:01.402 --> 15:02.945
You might all have slept for a week...

15:03.153 --> 15:05.322
...had I not administered
the universal drug antidote.

15:05.531 --> 15:07.491
Holy Rip van Winkle.

15:07.699 --> 15:12.204
One good thing did come of it, Robin.
We now know who our adversary is.

15:12.413 --> 15:16.375
Poor Commissioner Gordon,
he was so taken in by Catwoman.

15:16.583 --> 15:22.548
Mm. She's a very beautiful,
very enthralling woman, Robin.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.883
When you get older,
you'll see how easy it is...

15:25.092 --> 15:27.845
...to become lured
by the female of the species.

tango's our specialty, 3741 Laurel Avenue."

15:36.520 --> 15:38.313
To the Batmobile.

15:39.940 --> 15:44.820
<i>NARRATOR". Meantime, it's tea time
for Wayne Manor houseguests.</i>

15:45.028 --> 15:48.198
- There you are. I hope you like it.
-Thank you.

15:48.407 --> 15:50.159
Help yourself to cream and sugar.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.494
I always think tea is so civilized, don't you?

15:52.703 --> 15:55.706
I didn't realize this custom
had reached the colonies.

15:55.914 --> 15:59.168
Oh, my, yes, we serve tea every afternoon.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.628
- Oh, great.
-When Bruce told me...

16:01.837 --> 16:05.591
...that you were going to stay here,
I'd expected--

16:05.799 --> 16:08.010
Don't tell me,
you expected two grubby morons...

16:08.218 --> 16:12.014
...to come barging in here
and start smashing up the place, didn't you?

16:12.222 --> 16:13.557
Well, l... Heh.

16:13.765 --> 16:17.811
All right, Chad, start slashing cushions,
I'll go deal with the crockery in the kitchen.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.146
Right.

16:19.354 --> 16:22.900
Don't worry, love, we're not really like that,
you know, it's just our image.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.860
Oh...

16:25.235 --> 16:29.239
You know, it's funny. But just because our fans
are occasionally over-demonstrative...

16:29.448 --> 16:32.159
...people expect us to be the same way.
Thank you.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.828
Well, for instance,
Chad here was a medical student...

16:35.037 --> 16:37.998
...and I was reading for the law
when our first record came out.

16:38.207 --> 16:41.668
We hope to go back to school
as soon as we can to complete our education.

16:41.877 --> 16:44.463
- Mustn't be a dropout.
-Don't be a dropout. Yes.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.633
Just think of it: Every record our fans buy...

16:47.841 --> 16:51.220
...brings me another notch closer
to becoming a brain surgeon.

16:51.428 --> 16:55.265
Well, mercy alive.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.434
We can't appear at the Police Ball now.

16:57.643 --> 16:59.645
Not after you stole
the commissioner's voice.

16:59.853 --> 17:02.314
Everybody knows
you haven't really gone straight.

17:02.523 --> 17:05.983
Why don't you steal
Batman's voice while you're at it?

17:06.568 --> 17:07.736
Never.

17:07.944 --> 17:12.616
One of the few joys I have in life
is when his rich manly baritone...

17:12.824 --> 17:17.871
...caresses my ears with,
"Catwoman, you're under arrest."

17:18.079 --> 17:22.209
Oh, it makes everything worthwhile.
Ha, ha.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.753
Well, they're going to track us down,
Catwoman. Sure as shooting.

17:25.963 --> 17:29.299
They'll be at the dance studio
in two shakes of a cat's tail.

17:29.508 --> 17:33.720
- And we just wait here?
-Never you mind, my terrible trio of tabbies.

17:33.929 --> 17:36.265
Fear not. I have everything under control.

17:36.473 --> 17:38.976
Batman and Robin,
it will be their final performance.

17:39.184 --> 17:42.354
Now, I want you two
to pretend you're customers.

17:42.563 --> 17:43.605
And I want you...

17:47.484 --> 17:50.904
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
You see, the Watusi is definitely out.

17:51.113 --> 17:56.118
Now, maybe I can interest you in one of our
seven-year courses in Magyar folk dances?

18:01.665 --> 18:03.250
Citizen.

18:06.545 --> 18:09.506
Ha, ha. Well, well, well. If it isn't, uh...

18:10.090 --> 18:11.550
And, um...

18:11.758 --> 18:15.053
Oh, isn't that awful? I know your names
as well as I know my own.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.638
Benton Belgoody.

18:16.847 --> 18:18.348
- Batman.
-And Robin.

18:18.557 --> 18:23.770
Well, how could I forget a thing--
Of course, what can I do for you, Robin?

18:23.979 --> 18:27.441
We're here to see Ms. Klutz,
she's one of your dance instructors.

18:27.649 --> 18:30.319
Oh, yeah, well, I'm afraid
that's impossible right now.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.530
You see, with all the new dance steps
on the way out...

18:33.739 --> 18:37.034
...she's busy trying to find something
that's on the way in.

18:37.242 --> 18:40.829
Just tell her Batman and Robin
are here, Mr. Belgoody.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.372
And tell her fast.

18:42.581 --> 18:47.085
Well, my, my, there's a little bit of the devil
in you, isn't there, young man? Ha, ha.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.884
Just as I suspected, Robin,
she's up to her old tricks.

18:54.092 --> 18:57.346
Catwoman,
can't you see the folly of your ways?

18:57.554 --> 19:00.557
With your beauty and intelligence,
you could go much further...

19:00.766 --> 19:04.186
...helping your fellow man
rather than harming him.

19:04.394 --> 19:09.358
A bit of whimsy that escapes me
at the moment, Batman. Get him, guys.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.706
- You know something?
-Hm?

19:24.915 --> 19:28.210
If he weren't such an old stick in the mud,
I might let him live.

19:30.170 --> 19:34.257
But I think I can handle Batman.
It's just that Robin's all work and no play.

19:42.808 --> 19:45.644
You know,
maybe I can fix you up with Robin. Heh.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.021
No, it'd never work, he's too young.

19:48.230 --> 19:51.274
At that age,
all they're interested in is baseball.

20:46.371 --> 20:49.124
Now, are you ready to come quietly,
Catwoman?

20:49.332 --> 20:51.543
I guess so, Batman.

20:51.752 --> 20:55.380
Batman, can I ask you a favor before
you send me up the river without a paddle?

20:55.589 --> 20:57.132
What is that?

20:57.507 --> 20:59.801
Can I freshen up a little bit with makeup?

21:00.010 --> 21:04.681
I mean, my image might be damaged
if I was seen in public with a shiny nose.

21:04.890 --> 21:09.186
Yes, go ahead.
But don't try anything untoward.

21:23.909 --> 21:26.328
Holy Heidelberg, what did she do that for?

21:26.536 --> 21:30.999
I afraid we've been drugged, Robin.

21:31.208 --> 21:34.544
I guess you can never trust a woman.

21:34.753 --> 21:41.426
You've made a hasty
generalization, Robin, it's a bad habit to get into.

21:41.635 --> 21:48.558
But in this situation, it's entirely apr--

21:48.767 --> 21:50.143
Apr--

21:50.352 --> 21:52.437
Apropos.

22:02.823 --> 22:05.867
Wake up, little beddy-byes.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.917
Have you been beddy-bye?

22:15.502 --> 22:17.128
Catwoman.

22:17.337 --> 22:20.549
I'd advise you to yap
as little as possible, boys.

22:20.757 --> 22:24.427
You've been encased in an enormous
echo chamber weighing two tons.

22:24.636 --> 22:29.266
Every sound in there will be magnified
10 million times.

22:29.808 --> 22:33.478
Even your breathing will sound like thunder.
Ha, ha.

22:33.687 --> 22:35.856
And don't bother
looking for your utility belt.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.899
I've had it burned. Ha-ha-ha!

22:38.108 --> 22:42.362
- So, what's the purpose, CW?
-it's so that the drip...

22:43.154 --> 22:45.866
Why can't I get good help?

22:46.074 --> 22:47.951
Moe, turn on the faucet.

22:58.086 --> 23:03.550
I'm sure you recognize this as a variation
of the legendary Chinese water torture.

23:03.758 --> 23:08.680
When I throw that switch
the noise will become excruciating.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.433
And your eardrums will be shattered.

23:11.641 --> 23:16.354
Shortly following that
your brains will be turned into "yuch."

23:16.563 --> 23:17.898
And then I shall return...

23:19.107 --> 23:22.527
...and then you can be mine forever,
Batman.

23:23.904 --> 23:26.364
True, I'll have to sacrifice your intellect.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.452
Oh, well, with a build like yours, who cares?

23:30.660 --> 23:35.081
After all, one can't have one's cake
and eat it too. Heh.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.169
Ta-ta.
