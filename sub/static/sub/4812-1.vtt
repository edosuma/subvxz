01:53.112 --> 01:54.947
Bingo!

02:09.252 --> 02:11.130
Fucking hell.

02:13.382 --> 02:15.343
Fucking hell.

03:05.476 --> 03:08.145
- Oh, God...
- Keep your shit together.

03:08.229 --> 03:11.315
If you wanna get 'em out of here.

03:12.149 --> 03:14.819
- I can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it!

03:29.041 --> 03:31.544
Security, we have a break-in. Get the...

03:40.011 --> 03:42.847
I know who you are.
I know what you think...

03:42.930 --> 03:46.767
If you don't wanna get hurt,
keep your mouth shut and don't move.

03:46.851 --> 03:52.106
The chimps are infected. They're highly
contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.

03:52.190 --> 03:55.651
- Infected with what?
- To cure, you must first understand.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.696
Infected with what?

04:00.656 --> 04:02.533
Rage.

04:04.243 --> 04:07.413
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.

04:07.496 --> 04:08.831
No! No! No!

04:09.540 --> 04:13.836
Listen, you sick bastard,
we're taking your torture victims with us.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.505
We'll get you out of here.

04:15.588 --> 04:20.259
The animals are contagious. The infection
is in their blood and saliva. One bite...

04:20.343 --> 04:22.845
Stop... Stop! You've no idea!

04:29.393 --> 04:32.230
Get it off! Help me!

04:37.610 --> 04:39.737
Get it off! Get it off!

04:43.366 --> 04:46.577
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her!

04:48.663 --> 04:50.915
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

04:55.253 --> 04:58.464
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now!

05:00.967 --> 05:02.552
Oh, God...

06:51.536 --> 06:53.037
Hello?

07:31.492 --> 07:32.994
Hello?

07:51.137 --> 07:53.139
<i>Hello!</i>

09:35.074 --> 09:36.409
Hello?

10:02.727 --> 10:04.228
Hello!

14:56.562 --> 14:58.648
Hello?

15:06.656 --> 15:08.741
Hello?

15:23.089 --> 15:25.174
Father?

15:31.597 --> 15:33.683
Father, are you OK?

15:41.023 --> 15:43.693
Oh, shouldn't have done that.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.362
Shouldn't have done that.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.656
Shit!

16:15.433 --> 16:17.560
<i>Over here!</i>

16:20.438 --> 16:22.773
- Over here!
- Come on!

16:35.244 --> 16:37.705
Go, go, go!

16:42.960 --> 16:44.045
Keep going!

16:44.128 --> 16:47.006
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up!

16:55.139 --> 16:57.725
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?

17:25.044 --> 17:26.295
Let's go! Let's go!

17:26.378 --> 17:28.631
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just move!

17:37.431 --> 17:39.433
Come on!

17:58.619 --> 18:03.374
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.459
The giraffe falls over.

18:05.543 --> 18:10.756
The man goes to leave and the barman says
"Oi! You can't leave that lying there. "

18:10.840 --> 18:14.886
He says "No, it's not a lion. It's a giraffe".

18:22.518 --> 18:25.396
He's completely humourless.

18:25.479 --> 18:28.399
You two should get on like a house on fire.

18:29.901 --> 18:31.986
So who are you?

18:33.196 --> 18:35.114
You're from the hospital.

18:35.198 --> 18:38.701
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.

18:38.784 --> 18:41.120
I'm a bicycle courier.

18:43.289 --> 18:49.712
I was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.

18:49.795 --> 18:53.549
Then I wake up today in hospital.
I wake up and I'm...

18:53.633 --> 18:55.551
I'm hallucinating or I'm...

18:57.220 --> 18:59.680
What's your name?

18:59.764 --> 19:01.849
Jim.

19:02.517 --> 19:05.186
I'm Mark. This is Selena.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.275
OK, Jim.

19:16.489 --> 19:19.033
I've got some bad news.

19:19.116 --> 19:25.373
It started as rioting, and right from
the beginning you knew this was different.

19:25.456 --> 19:29.627
Because it was happening
in small villages, market towns.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.256
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.

19:33.339 --> 19:38.052
It was in the street outside.
It was coming through your windows.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.971
It was a virus.

19:40.054 --> 19:41.848
An infection.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.767
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.311
It was the blood.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.897
There was something in the blood.

19:51.357 --> 19:56.320
By the time they tried to evacuate
the cities, it was already too late.

19:56.404 --> 19:59.323
The infection was everywhere.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.909
The army blockades were overrun.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.164
And that's when the exodus started.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.293
The day before broadcasting stopped,

20:10.376 --> 20:14.046
there were reports of Infection
in Paris and New York.

20:16.424 --> 20:19.343
We didn't hear anything more after that.

20:22.305 --> 20:25.266
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.810
Of course there's a government!

20:27.894 --> 20:31.981
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...

20:32.064 --> 20:36.360
No, there's no government,
no police, no army.

20:37.820 --> 20:40.907
No TV, no radio, no electricity.

20:41.532 --> 20:45.703
You're the first uninfected person
we've seen in six days.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.623
Where's your family?

20:49.540 --> 20:51.584
They're dead. Like Selena's.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.794
Yours will be dead too.

21:04.096 --> 21:08.100
Look, I have to find them.
They live in Deptford. I can walk it. OK?

21:08.184 --> 21:10.770
You'll go and come back, yeah?

21:12.730 --> 21:14.982
- You won't.
- Yes!

21:15.066 --> 21:18.069
No one ever comes back.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.659
So lesson one.

21:25.535 --> 21:29.956
You never go anywhere alone
unless you've got no choice.

21:30.039 --> 21:32.375
Lesson two.

21:32.458 --> 21:36.546
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.

21:38.589 --> 21:40.633
We'll take you tomorrow.

21:40.716 --> 21:44.303
We'll all go and find
your dead parents together, OK?

21:45.346 --> 21:46.806
Eat.

21:58.985 --> 22:02.154
If you want her to slow down,
you'll have to say.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.725
- If there's anyone...
- I understand.

22:30.808 --> 22:32.894
- Anyone...
- I understand!

22:35.021 --> 22:36.564
OK.

23:18.356 --> 23:19.690
Jim...

23:20.525 --> 23:21.859
Wait!

24:46.527 --> 24:50.489
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.992
I'm not grateful.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.245
My...

24:56.954 --> 25:01.459
parents and my sister,
we went to Paddington Station,

25:04.086 --> 25:09.425
hoping maybe we could get on a plane,
maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.428
I remember my dad had all this cash,

25:12.512 --> 25:15.848
even though cash was completely useless.

25:17.391 --> 25:20.520
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.233
Crowd was surging.

25:26.067 --> 25:28.402
I lost my grip on my sister's hand.

25:30.571 --> 25:32.907
I remember the ground was soft.

25:34.867 --> 25:39.247
I looked down
and I was standing on all these people.

25:39.330 --> 25:43.292
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...

25:43.376 --> 25:47.338
Somewhere in the crowd
there were Infected. It spread fast.

25:47.421 --> 25:50.758
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.

25:52.385 --> 25:55.471
Climb over more people.
So I did that. I climbed.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.932
And I got up on top of this kiosk.

26:00.226 --> 26:05.189
Looking down, you couldn't tell
which faces were infected and which weren't.

26:05.273 --> 26:09.151
Then I saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.195
My dad.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.575
His face...

26:19.245 --> 26:23.166
Selena's right.
You should be grateful.

26:23.249 --> 26:28.421
We don't have time to get back to the shop
before dark. We should stay here tonight.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.926
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.

26:34.010 --> 26:37.346
No, we'll all sleep in the same room. It's safer.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.720
<i>Jim.</i>

28:08.396 --> 28:10.481
<i>- You're back.
- Yeah.</i>

28:16.863 --> 28:18.948
<i>- How was it?
- Fine.</i>

28:20.032 --> 28:22.326
<i>Give me a drink of that, will ya?</i>

28:22.410 --> 28:24.495
<i>- It's empty.
- Ha!</i>

28:26.789 --> 28:29.125
<i>Here.</i>

28:31.210 --> 28:33.296
<i>I'll start working on them, then.</i>

28:39.927 --> 28:41.929
Mark! Mark!

28:42.722 --> 28:44.849
Selena! Help!

28:59.197 --> 29:01.282
<i>It's clear.</i>

29:06.746 --> 29:09.707
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?

29:09.790 --> 29:12.001
And his daughter. From four doors down.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.171
- Were you bitten?
- No.

29:15.254 --> 29:18.174
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?

29:19.091 --> 29:21.093
No.

29:24.222 --> 29:25.973
Mark?

29:28.392 --> 29:30.102
Wait...

29:51.958 --> 29:54.168
Get that cleaned off.

29:56.045 --> 29:58.130
Do you have any clothes here?

29:59.257 --> 30:01.133
Um... I... Yes.

30:01.217 --> 30:04.887
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.

30:04.971 --> 30:08.641
More Infected will be coming.
They always do.

30:37.420 --> 30:40.423
<i>How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?</i>

30:40.506 --> 30:44.427
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. It was on you.

30:44.510 --> 30:49.891
I didn't know he was infected.
He knew. I could see it in his face.

30:49.974 --> 30:54.395
If someone gets infected,
you've about 20 seconds to kill them.

30:54.478 --> 30:59.609
It might be your brother, your sister
or your oldest friend. It makes no difference.

30:59.692 --> 31:05.114
Just so you know where you stand,
if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.

31:05.198 --> 31:09.410
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans, Jim?

31:09.494 --> 31:13.956
Do you want us to find a cure and
save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?

31:14.040 --> 31:16.542
Plans are pointless.

31:16.626 --> 31:19.212
Staying alive's as good as it gets.

31:21.047 --> 31:22.465
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.634
What's that?

31:30.723 --> 31:32.808
Let's go.

32:17.937 --> 32:21.065
What is it about tower blocks
and shopping trolleys?

32:21.148 --> 32:24.235
Stop talking. It's a long way up.

32:33.953 --> 32:36.289
<i>Do you need a break?</i>

32:37.498 --> 32:39.500
- You?
- No.

32:42.170 --> 32:44.255
Now I do need a break.

32:54.724 --> 32:56.559
What's up?

32:56.642 --> 32:58.644
Nothin'.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.356
I got a headache.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.941
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.

33:04.025 --> 33:09.322
- Why didn't you say something before?
- I didn't think you'd give a shit.

33:10.531 --> 33:14.785
You've got no fat on you
and all you've had to eat is sugar.

33:14.869 --> 33:16.996
So you're crashing.

33:17.079 --> 33:19.332
There isn't a lot we can do about that

33:19.415 --> 33:24.504
except pump you full of painkillers
and give you more sugar. As for sugar,

33:24.587 --> 33:26.881
Pepsi or Lilt?

33:28.132 --> 33:30.134
Do you have any Tango?

33:30.218 --> 33:33.262
Actually,
I did have a can of Tango somewhere.

33:34.472 --> 33:36.724
Quiet! That's an Infected.

33:47.068 --> 33:48.903
Oh no, they're in. Move!

33:51.989 --> 33:54.534
Wait up, Selena!

33:55.451 --> 33:57.453
Wait for me, please!

33:57.537 --> 33:59.664
Please, Selena! Please!

33:59.747 --> 34:02.083
- Wait for me!
- Come on!

34:02.166 --> 34:04.168
- Run!
- Wait!

34:04.794 --> 34:07.505
Please! For fuck's sake!

34:08.089 --> 34:10.341
<i>Selena!</i>

34:12.051 --> 34:15.429
Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move!

34:15.513 --> 34:17.598
Thank you. Thank you.

34:30.069 --> 34:32.112
Open the door!

34:37.702 --> 34:39.286
Open the door!

34:44.000 --> 34:46.502
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?

34:46.585 --> 34:48.045
What?

34:50.630 --> 34:53.634
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?

34:53.717 --> 34:56.012
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.

35:03.936 --> 35:06.230
Go in. Go in!

35:24.248 --> 35:26.709
So, I'm Frank, anyway.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.586
Jim.

35:29.420 --> 35:32.507
- Selena.
- Selena. Good to meet you.

35:32.590 --> 35:34.884
This is my daughter Hannah.

35:34.967 --> 35:37.220
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.

35:38.638 --> 35:40.723
Come on.

35:41.474 --> 35:43.434
So...

35:43.518 --> 35:45.436
This is great. Just great.

35:47.772 --> 35:50.066
Calls for a celebration, I'd say.

35:50.149 --> 35:53.194
Why don't you all sit down and...

35:53.277 --> 35:56.239
Hannah, what have we got to offer?

35:56.322 --> 35:58.825
We've got Mum's crème de menthe.

35:58.908 --> 36:01.619
Great. Crème de menthe.

36:01.702 --> 36:04.413
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.

36:04.497 --> 36:06.958
Get comfortable.

36:09.794 --> 36:12.797
<i>- Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.</i>

36:12.880 --> 36:15.758
Nah, the good ones. It's a celebration.

36:15.842 --> 36:18.344
Top cupboard.

36:18.427 --> 36:21.138
So this is your place?

36:22.390 --> 36:24.141
It's nice.

36:37.321 --> 36:38.447
There.

36:38.531 --> 36:41.617
I know it isn't much but, well, cheers.

36:41.701 --> 36:43.452
Cheers.

37:04.974 --> 37:07.059
You OK in there, Jim?

37:08.019 --> 37:10.354
Yeah.

37:10.438 --> 37:16.027
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.

37:17.695 --> 37:19.947
You'll have to use the bucket.

37:26.496 --> 37:29.123
Have to empty it each morning.

37:29.207 --> 37:32.877
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.

37:32.960 --> 37:34.670
It's fine.

37:34.754 --> 37:37.882
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.

37:39.550 --> 37:41.928
We have a spare room.

37:42.970 --> 37:44.263
In there.

37:44.347 --> 37:46.307
Are you and Selena...?

37:47.558 --> 37:49.393
No. No, no, no.

37:49.477 --> 37:51.145
Um...

37:51.229 --> 37:53.606
I'll take the living room. It's fine.

37:53.689 --> 37:55.566
Right.

37:56.442 --> 37:58.528
No, I mean, yeah.

37:59.570 --> 38:01.572
So, um...

38:02.615 --> 38:05.618
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.

38:20.258 --> 38:21.801
Very spruce.

38:23.135 --> 38:25.972
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.

38:30.309 --> 38:34.021
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.

38:35.147 --> 38:37.984
Probably need us more than we need them.

38:39.443 --> 38:41.696
I think they're good people.

38:44.532 --> 38:47.493
- Good people?
- Yeah.

38:49.287 --> 38:53.958
You should be more concerned about
whether they're gonna slow you down.

38:54.041 --> 38:57.795
- Because if they slowed you down...
- I'd leave them behind.

38:57.879 --> 38:59.797
- In a heartbeat.
- Yeah.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.175
I wouldn't.

39:02.258 --> 39:05.803
Then you're gonna wind up
getting yourself killed.

39:14.145 --> 39:16.647
I'm gonna get some sleep.

39:19.150 --> 39:21.027
Selena...

39:21.861 --> 39:25.114
You think I don't get it, but I do get it.

39:26.991 --> 39:30.995
And I know I'd be dead already
if I hadn't met you.

39:31.496 --> 39:33.080
Sure.

39:33.164 --> 39:34.749
No, look...

39:37.126 --> 39:39.212
I mean, thank you.

39:42.381 --> 39:44.550
And I mean, sure.

39:44.634 --> 39:47.428
Goodnight, Jim.

39:47.512 --> 39:49.597
Goodnight.

40:03.194 --> 40:05.279
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.

40:05.363 --> 40:09.492
I thought we'd be OK with the water
from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.

40:09.575 --> 40:12.787
But it vanishes so quick
you wouldn't believe.

40:16.082 --> 40:17.792
You drink it,

40:17.875 --> 40:19.669
it evaporates,

40:19.752 --> 40:21.838
turns stagnant.

40:24.215 --> 40:26.300
They're all empty.

40:27.176 --> 40:29.178
Hasn't rained in ten days.

40:29.262 --> 40:33.516
You can set up a plastic sheet
to catch dew and condensation.

40:33.599 --> 40:37.353
Saw it on TV once, but I can't make it work.

40:38.688 --> 40:40.773
You'd never think it.

40:41.691 --> 40:44.652
Needing rain so badly.

40:46.320 --> 40:48.739
Not in fucking England!

40:53.411 --> 40:56.539
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.

41:05.464 --> 41:09.218
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.

41:09.302 --> 41:13.890
<i>Salvation is here.
The answer to Infection is here.</i>

41:13.973 --> 41:16.976
<i>If you can hear this, you're not alone.</i>

41:17.059 --> 41:21.564
<i>There are others like you.
There are other survivors.</i>

41:21.647 --> 41:23.858
<i>We are soldiers and we are armed.</i>

41:23.941 --> 41:27.236
Oh, my God. Soldiers.

41:27.320 --> 41:31.908
<i>- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,</i>

41:31.991 --> 41:35.411
<i>27 miles northeast of Manchester.</i>

41:35.495 --> 41:39.415
<i>- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now it just repeats.</i>

41:39.499 --> 41:41.876
- It's a recording?
- Yeah, it's a recording.

41:41.959 --> 41:44.879
But this is where it's telling us to go.

41:44.962 --> 41:47.131
Just there.

41:48.633 --> 41:53.429
The way things are, we might need
two or three days to get up there.

41:53.513 --> 41:55.223
"We"?

41:59.310 --> 42:05.399
<i>Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah
do need you more than you need us.</i>

42:05.483 --> 42:08.653
- Look, I didn't...
- No, it's OK. It's the truth.

42:08.736 --> 42:11.239
I can't leave the block if it's the two of us.

42:11.322 --> 42:15.284
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. I couldn't risk it.

42:15.368 --> 42:17.078
But with other people...

42:17.161 --> 42:21.457
If it's a recording,
the soldiers who made it could be dead.

42:21.541 --> 42:25.044
- It's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to Infection...

42:25.127 --> 42:29.423
There is no answer!
It's already done all the damage it can!

42:29.507 --> 42:32.343
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.

42:32.426 --> 42:36.514
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!

42:38.599 --> 42:40.893
Or die here.

42:40.977 --> 42:46.691
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.

42:48.192 --> 42:50.069
We need each other.

42:50.153 --> 42:55.449
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.

42:56.159 --> 42:58.244
So we have to try and get there.

42:59.370 --> 43:00.955
Get there how?

43:12.383 --> 43:16.137
Just so you know,
I don't take cheques or credit cards.

43:44.707 --> 43:47.710
<i>- What do you think?
- It's the most direct route.</i>

43:47.793 --> 43:53.049
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.

43:53.132 --> 43:55.468
<i>Let's just get it done.</i>

44:08.397 --> 44:10.566
<i>No, no.</i>

44:10.650 --> 44:13.152
No. See, this is a really shit idea.

44:14.028 --> 44:17.406
<i>You know why?
Because it's obviously a shit idea.</i>

44:17.490 --> 44:21.869
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel
full of fucking smashed cars...

44:21.953 --> 44:24.872
It's really fucking obviously a shit idea!

44:24.956 --> 44:27.208
Hold on!

44:36.384 --> 44:38.261
Dad!

44:57.697 --> 44:59.240
Fuck!

45:00.533 --> 45:02.952
The world's worst place to get a flat.

45:03.035 --> 45:06.372
Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.

45:08.875 --> 45:11.043
I've got the wheel. You're on the jack.

45:25.641 --> 45:29.187
Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?

45:29.270 --> 45:31.355
Hear what?

45:32.023 --> 45:34.317
<i>Right, I've done it.</i>

45:35.902 --> 45:37.361
Dad?

45:41.240 --> 45:44.327
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

45:44.410 --> 45:45.953
Fucking rats!

45:56.506 --> 45:59.091
They're running from the Infected.

45:59.175 --> 46:01.093
Move it!

46:01.177 --> 46:05.473
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.

46:05.556 --> 46:08.809
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!

46:12.772 --> 46:14.732
Lift, lift!

46:15.274 --> 46:20.404
<i>- Don't look at them! Don't look!
- I can see them! They're coming!</i>

46:26.118 --> 46:28.704
Come on, Hannah!

46:28.788 --> 46:31.207
Almost.

46:31.290 --> 46:34.210
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- I'm trying.

46:39.006 --> 46:41.676
Three, two, one,

46:41.759 --> 46:43.469
drop it!

46:47.598 --> 46:50.059
- Get in the car!
- Come on!

46:52.144 --> 46:54.522
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!

46:57.441 --> 46:59.527
<i>Whoo!</i>

47:04.323 --> 47:06.409
Goodbye, you fuckers!

47:14.375 --> 47:16.669
Frank, stop the cab.

47:39.650 --> 47:41.944
Let's shop.

47:52.580 --> 47:54.081
You...

47:54.874 --> 47:56.375
You...

47:57.210 --> 47:58.294
You...

47:58.377 --> 48:00.963
<i>Anybody seen any buns?</i>

48:01.047 --> 48:03.841
Hmm. Irradiated.

48:06.552 --> 48:10.139
Don't take anything
that needs to be cooked, OK?

48:10.223 --> 48:12.058
I think you can eat that raw.

48:12.141 --> 48:14.018
Decaffeinated coffee...

48:14.101 --> 48:16.187
Put that back.

48:17.396 --> 48:19.649
Can't just take any crap.

48:19.732 --> 48:24.237
If I never see another chocolate bar again,
it'll be too soon.

48:24.654 --> 48:27.323
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!

48:28.950 --> 48:32.578
Now, single malt,
16-year-old, dark, full flavour.

48:33.538 --> 48:35.498
Warm but not aggressive.

48:35.581 --> 48:39.085
<i>Peaty aftertaste.</i>

48:40.670 --> 48:43.923
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.

49:38.811 --> 49:41.898
Either we do this now or we're walking.

49:48.905 --> 49:50.990
Not you.

49:54.327 --> 49:56.621
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?

49:56.704 --> 49:58.789
You heard.

50:25.358 --> 50:27.443
Where are you going?

50:28.528 --> 50:30.947
We've got enough food, Jim.

50:31.030 --> 50:33.366
We don't have any cheeseburgers.

50:34.116 --> 50:36.786
<i>Like going on holidays
with your aunt!</i>

51:15.992 --> 51:18.452
Oh, Jesus.

51:44.270 --> 51:45.813
Hello?

51:59.619 --> 52:01.412
I hate you!

52:10.588 --> 52:12.673
Find anything?

52:14.926 --> 52:17.720
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.

52:17.803 --> 52:19.889
OK, we're done here.

52:22.099 --> 52:23.976
OK, Hannah.

52:31.359 --> 52:33.027
Easy. Brake!

52:33.110 --> 52:35.196
Brake, brake!

52:43.037 --> 52:45.122
Out.

53:29.709 --> 53:32.920
<i>Mmmm! Oh my God!</i>

53:33.671 --> 53:36.674
I can, like, taste the vitamin C.

53:37.508 --> 53:40.303
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.

53:41.512 --> 53:43.598
What did you say?

53:43.681 --> 53:46.475
The raisins. They're so moist.

53:51.230 --> 53:53.316
Look over here.

54:04.619 --> 54:06.454
Like a family.

54:06.537 --> 54:08.998
<i>Do you think they're infected?</i>

54:09.415 --> 54:11.501
<i>No.</i>

54:14.962 --> 54:17.673
They're doing just fine.

54:23.429 --> 54:25.515
Come on. Let's eat!

54:40.196 --> 54:41.531
Know what I was thinking?

54:41.614 --> 54:45.326
That you'll never hear
another piece of original music again.

54:45.409 --> 54:49.580
You'll never read a book
that hasn't already been written,

54:50.623 --> 54:54.460
or see a film that hasn't already been shot.

54:58.965 --> 55:02.218
<i>Um... that's what you were thinking.</i>

55:02.301 --> 55:04.178
No.

55:05.429 --> 55:07.723
I was thinking I was wrong.

55:08.975 --> 55:11.060
About what?

55:12.770 --> 55:14.856
All the death.

55:15.439 --> 55:17.525
All this shit.

55:19.152 --> 55:23.656
It doesn't really mean anything
to Frank and Hannah because...

55:25.032 --> 55:28.494
Well, she's got her dad
and he's got his daughter. So...

55:28.578 --> 55:30.705
Cheeky monkey!

55:31.164 --> 55:34.792
I was wrong when I said
staying alive is as good as it gets.

55:38.421 --> 55:40.923
<i>See, that's what I was thinking.</i>

55:41.424 --> 55:43.092
Was it?

55:43.176 --> 55:45.469
Mm. You stole my thought.

55:50.683 --> 55:52.560
Sorry.

55:53.519 --> 55:55.396
That's OK.

55:55.480 --> 55:57.565
You can keep it.

55:58.691 --> 56:02.695
It's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.

56:17.752 --> 56:20.296
I can't sleep.

56:20.379 --> 56:23.007
Me neither.

56:23.090 --> 56:25.468
Doesn't feel safe, does it?

56:25.551 --> 56:27.637
Outside like this.

56:28.513 --> 56:30.932
I think we're safe enough.

56:31.015 --> 56:33.684
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.

56:34.393 --> 56:36.896
Yeah, I noticed that.

56:36.979 --> 56:38.481
Hey, Selena...

56:38.564 --> 56:40.650
What? What is it?

56:41.984 --> 56:44.028
How'd you get to sleep?

56:50.493 --> 56:54.372
Bloody hell. Must've needed
a hell of a prescription for that lot.

56:54.455 --> 56:58.751
I didn't need a prescription.
I qualified as a chemist.

56:58.835 --> 57:01.379
Oh, great. Valium.

57:01.462 --> 57:04.048
Not only will we be able to get to sleep

57:04.131 --> 57:07.844
but if we're attacked in the middle
of the night, we won't even care.

57:07.927 --> 57:10.179
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.

57:10.263 --> 57:12.306
Can I, Dad?

57:12.390 --> 57:14.392
I don't think so, sweetheart.

57:14.475 --> 57:15.977
Please?

57:17.478 --> 57:19.564
- No.
- I can't sleep.

57:22.650 --> 57:25.361
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.

57:26.445 --> 57:30.449
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.

57:41.127 --> 57:43.087
Night-night.

57:43.880 --> 57:46.507
You're a big softie, Frank.

58:17.121 --> 58:19.081
Frank?

58:19.165 --> 58:21.250
Hannah?

58:21.334 --> 58:23.211
Frank?

58:28.841 --> 58:30.927
Hello? Hello!

58:31.969 --> 58:33.221
Hello!

58:33.304 --> 58:35.806
Hello! Hello!

58:43.898 --> 58:45.983
Shh...

58:47.360 --> 58:50.154
You're having a bad dream, that's all.

58:52.907 --> 58:54.992
Thanks, Dad.

59:30.278 --> 59:32.864
Come on, sleepyhead.

59:36.534 --> 59:38.619
Come on, Babe Ruth.

59:41.831 --> 59:43.708
<i>Hurry up.</i>

59:45.459 --> 59:48.963
<i>- Did I miss breakfast?
- You'll sleep through anything.</i>

59:49.046 --> 59:54.051
<i>- Did you have a fry-up?
- We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door!</i>

01:00:18.618 --> 01:00:23.122
<i>Our location
is the 42nd blockade, the M602,</i>

01:00:23.206 --> 01:00:26.292
<i>27 miles northeast of Manchester.</i>

01:00:26.375 --> 01:00:28.294
<i>You must find us. Please!</i>

01:00:28.377 --> 01:00:30.505
<i>Salvation is here.</i>

01:00:30.588 --> 01:00:33.633
<i>The answer to Infection is here.</i>

01:01:05.665 --> 01:01:07.750
Must be Manchester.

01:01:09.961 --> 01:01:13.339
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.

01:01:15.174 --> 01:01:17.510
No fire crews to put it out.

01:02:12.315 --> 01:02:14.901
42nd blockade.

01:02:14.984 --> 01:02:17.320
This is it.

01:03:28.474 --> 01:03:32.478
I don't understand, Dad.
Did they leave?

01:03:32.562 --> 01:03:35.690
- I don't like this. I think we should go.
- No!

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:47.368
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.

01:04:05.511 --> 01:04:07.430
Nothing.

01:04:07.513 --> 01:04:09.432
I can't believe it.

01:04:09.515 --> 01:04:11.476
Frank...

01:04:11.934 --> 01:04:13.811
Frank!

01:04:16.022 --> 01:04:17.690
- We have to go.
- Yeah.

01:04:17.773 --> 01:04:20.276
Go fucking where?!

01:04:59.398 --> 01:05:01.567
Get out of it.

01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:07.156
Get out of it!

01:05:24.966 --> 01:05:27.552
Dad, are you all right?

01:05:27.635 --> 01:05:30.304
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.

01:05:31.222 --> 01:05:33.933
Sorry I lost my temper.

01:05:34.016 --> 01:05:36.144
Hannah...

01:05:36.227 --> 01:05:39.188
I love you very much.

01:05:39.272 --> 01:05:41.274
- What?
- Keep away from me.

01:05:41.357 --> 01:05:43.693
Stay where you are.

01:05:43.776 --> 01:05:46.696
- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!

01:05:46.779 --> 01:05:49.282
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!

01:05:49.365 --> 01:05:52.493
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!

01:05:53.995 --> 01:05:56.747
<i>What's wrong? Dad!</i>

01:06:01.043 --> 01:06:03.462
Jim! Jim, he's infected!

01:06:03.546 --> 01:06:06.174
- No!
- Now, Jim! Now!

01:06:06.257 --> 01:06:09.677
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.053
Kill him!

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.814
Stay away from him!

01:06:23.065 --> 01:06:25.485
Keep away from the body!

01:06:28.237 --> 01:06:30.114
Dad?

01:06:52.512 --> 01:06:55.181
<i>Three survivors. One male, two female.</i>

01:06:55.264 --> 01:06:58.601
I repeat, one male, two female.

01:06:58.684 --> 01:07:01.270
ETA, 15.

01:07:01.354 --> 01:07:03.815
Put the kettle on.

01:07:51.779 --> 01:07:54.282
I'm Major Henry West.

01:07:55.533 --> 01:07:57.243
- Welcome.
- Jim.

01:07:57.326 --> 01:07:59.328
Hello, Jim.

01:07:59.412 --> 01:08:01.164
Hello.

01:08:03.416 --> 01:08:08.296
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets
and a boiler that produces hot water.

01:08:08.379 --> 01:08:10.798
So you can all have a shower.

01:08:10.882 --> 01:08:14.218
You look like you need one. Please.

01:08:34.154 --> 01:08:39.368
It ain't funny. I got loads of cooking to do,
you fucking Doris!

01:08:40.453 --> 01:08:42.580
Run him over!

01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:48.085
<i>How is she doing?</i>

01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:51.339
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.

01:08:54.008 --> 01:08:56.511
It's all fucked.

01:08:56.594 --> 01:08:58.595
What do you mean?

01:09:03.643 --> 01:09:07.229
Oh, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:07.313 --> 01:09:09.398
Hey, don't do that.

01:09:11.067 --> 01:09:16.072
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough,
strong, and she'll cope just like I'll cope.

01:09:16.154 --> 01:09:20.076
- Just like you'll cope.
- I don't want her to have to fucking cope.

01:09:21.368 --> 01:09:23.787
I want her to be OK.

01:09:25.372 --> 01:09:27.542
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.

01:09:27.625 --> 01:09:30.419
It was OK for them and it was OK for us.

01:09:33.756 --> 01:09:36.175
Now it's all just fucked.

01:10:07.623 --> 01:10:10.459
So you heard our broadcast?

01:10:10.543 --> 01:10:14.046
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.

01:10:14.130 --> 01:10:20.261
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army
base with helicopters and a field hospital.

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.851
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to Infection.

01:10:29.187 --> 01:10:31.272
Yeah.

01:10:31.355 --> 01:10:35.860
As I said before, it's here. Though
it may not be quite what you imagined.

01:10:36.235 --> 01:10:39.155
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.

01:10:39.238 --> 01:10:42.366
The fire drove hundreds of Infected
out of Manchester.

01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:45.536
The surrounding area's teeming with them.

01:10:47.288 --> 01:10:49.916
But don't worry.

01:10:49.999 --> 01:10:52.502
You're quite safe here.

01:10:55.588 --> 01:11:01.469
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights
which we've rigged up to a generator.

01:11:02.512 --> 01:11:05.097
High perimeter wall which helps.

01:11:05.181 --> 01:11:09.435
And we've been lacing the ground
with tripwires and land mines.

01:11:09.519 --> 01:11:14.190
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn,
but if they get in, we hear them.

01:11:17.443 --> 01:11:22.365
Secondary to protection,
our real job is to rebuild. Start again.

01:11:22.448 --> 01:11:24.867
The belly of the house. The heart.

01:11:24.951 --> 01:11:30.206
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot
water. The first step towards civilisation.

01:11:30.289 --> 01:11:32.375
The kitchen.

01:11:32.458 --> 01:11:34.585
Here you are. I'll swap you.

01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:37.880
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.

01:11:37.964 --> 01:11:42.009
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.

01:11:42.093 --> 01:11:44.470
Jones, our resident tin opener.

01:11:44.554 --> 01:11:47.557
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.

01:11:48.182 --> 01:11:50.268
I can't wait.

01:11:57.775 --> 01:12:00.027
And lastly, meet Mailer.

01:12:03.823 --> 01:12:05.783
Mailer, Jim.

01:12:05.867 --> 01:12:07.994
Jim, Mailer.

01:12:09.328 --> 01:12:11.873
Got infected two days ago.

01:12:11.956 --> 01:12:17.044
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold
and we got a chain round his neck.

01:12:21.674 --> 01:12:23.759
Keeping him alive?

01:12:24.719 --> 01:12:28.764
The idea was to learn something
about Infection.

01:12:30.099 --> 01:12:32.185
Have him teach me.

01:12:38.858 --> 01:12:40.943
And has he?

01:12:43.112 --> 01:12:45.281
In a way.

01:12:51.454 --> 01:12:54.874
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.

01:12:54.957 --> 01:12:57.126
Farm crops,

01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:59.879
raise livestock.

01:12:59.962 --> 01:13:02.381
He's telling me he's futureless.

01:13:06.511 --> 01:13:11.891
And eventually he'll tell me how long
the Infected take to starve to death.

01:13:51.639 --> 01:13:54.100
? You'll have to wait and see

01:13:54.183 --> 01:13:56.435
? Hope it's chips, it's chips

01:13:56.519 --> 01:13:59.105
? We hope it's chips, it's chips

01:14:07.655 --> 01:14:10.074
Hat.

01:14:10.158 --> 01:14:12.660
So, what have we here?

01:14:15.496 --> 01:14:18.875
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...

01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:26.382
<i>- Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!</i>

01:14:26.465 --> 01:14:28.926
- It's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.

01:14:29.010 --> 01:14:32.221
Absolutely. I was going to propose a toast

01:14:32.305 --> 01:14:35.433
but this omelette will do just as well.

01:14:38.019 --> 01:14:40.521
<i>- To new friends.
- New friends.</i>

01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:54.911
Jones, did you notice while cooking
that these eggs were off?

01:14:54.994 --> 01:14:58.414
I thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.

01:14:58.498 --> 01:15:00.374
Get rid of it.

01:15:02.835 --> 01:15:05.296
<i>Doris, you twat.</i>

01:15:05.379 --> 01:15:08.174
I don't suppose you can cook, can you?

01:15:09.008 --> 01:15:14.472
I can't tell you how badly we need
someone with a little flair in the kitchen.

01:15:14.555 --> 01:15:19.101
What a fucking disappointment.
I saw those eggs, I thought it was Christmas.

01:15:19.185 --> 01:15:22.438
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.

01:15:22.522 --> 01:15:25.358
You muppet! Look at him, eh?

01:15:25.441 --> 01:15:29.487
He's still waiting
for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.

01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:33.908
- You don't know nothing.
- I think Bill's got a point.

01:15:33.991 --> 01:15:37.119
If you look at the whole life of the planet,

01:15:37.203 --> 01:15:39.121
we...

01:15:39.205 --> 01:15:43.334
you know, Man has only been around
for a few blinks of an eye.

01:15:44.085 --> 01:15:46.546
So if the infection wipes us all out,

01:15:47.547 --> 01:15:49.841
<i>that is a return to normality.</i>

01:15:53.845 --> 01:15:56.848
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:15:56.931 --> 01:16:00.184
Have you met our New Age sergeant?

01:16:00.268 --> 01:16:02.979
Our spiritual guru.

01:16:03.062 --> 01:16:08.276
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why
did you join the army in the first place?

01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:15.199
This is what I've seen
in the four weeks since Infection.

01:16:15.283 --> 01:16:17.910
People killing people.

01:16:17.994 --> 01:16:22.540
Which is what I saw in the four weeks before
Infection, the four weeks before that...

01:16:22.623 --> 01:16:28.087
As far back as I care to remember,
people killing people.

01:16:28.171 --> 01:16:31.799
Which to my mind
puts us in a state of normality now.

01:16:40.099 --> 01:16:43.060
- You're not eating?
- I don't want to eat.

01:16:43.144 --> 01:16:45.938
You must eat, Hannah.

01:16:46.022 --> 01:16:49.275
I don't want to eat.
I want to bury my dad.

01:16:50.193 --> 01:16:53.321
He's one of the people you're talking about.

01:16:57.408 --> 01:16:59.452
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:02.497
Move!

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:04.874
Move! Move! Move!

01:17:13.758 --> 01:17:15.843
Enemy in front!

01:17:48.668 --> 01:17:51.170
Mick, I fucking got one!

01:17:51.254 --> 01:17:54.882
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt!

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.814
Fucking hell! He bounced!

01:18:09.897 --> 01:18:11.482
Cease fire!

01:18:11.566 --> 01:18:13.860
I ain't never seen that in my life!

01:18:13.943 --> 01:18:16.612
- Report clear!
- Fucking hell!

01:18:16.696 --> 01:18:18.406
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:18:18.489 --> 01:18:19.615
Yeah, yeah, clear.

01:18:30.209 --> 01:18:32.295
Oh, hello!

01:18:36.507 --> 01:18:42.138
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't
gonna be needing this any more.

01:18:42.221 --> 01:18:44.432
Cos you got me to protect you now.

01:18:46.225 --> 01:18:51.522
You wanna get your hands on a really
big chopper, you just come and see me.

01:18:51.606 --> 01:18:53.065
Fuck you!

01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:55.318
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.

01:18:55.401 --> 01:18:57.403
How about right now?

01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:59.947
Mitchell!

01:19:01.532 --> 01:19:06.037
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go
picking a fight with me, son.

01:19:07.330 --> 01:19:09.957
Sergeant Farrell!

01:19:13.753 --> 01:19:16.797
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.

01:19:16.881 --> 01:19:20.343
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.

01:19:22.553 --> 01:19:24.639
Slow down.

01:19:27.767 --> 01:19:30.728
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

01:19:30.812 --> 01:19:33.523
Clear the bodies off the lawn.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.986
The rest of you, go with him.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.246
My apologies.

01:19:51.999 --> 01:19:53.751
Drink?

01:19:58.631 --> 01:20:01.300
Look, we're grateful, OK?

01:20:01.384 --> 01:20:05.596
We're very grateful for your protection
but if we're gonna stay here...

01:20:05.680 --> 01:20:07.223
- Who have you killed?
- No one.

01:20:07.306 --> 01:20:12.478
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive
now if you hadn't killed somebody.

01:20:19.735 --> 01:20:22.864
I killed... I killed a boy.

01:20:27.201 --> 01:20:29.287
A child?

01:20:30.663 --> 01:20:32.748
Yes.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:39.297
But you had to.
Otherwise he'd have killed you.

01:20:42.842 --> 01:20:44.719
Survival.

01:20:48.139 --> 01:20:50.224
I understand.

01:20:52.602 --> 01:20:55.104
I promised them women.

01:20:57.064 --> 01:20:59.150
What?

01:21:00.276 --> 01:21:04.071
Eight days ago I found Jones
with his gun in his mouth.

01:21:05.239 --> 01:21:09.952
He said he was going to kill himself
because there was no future.

01:21:10.036 --> 01:21:12.914
What could I say to him?

01:21:12.997 --> 01:21:18.211
We fight off the Infected or we wait
until they starve to death and then what?

01:21:19.128 --> 01:21:22.965
What do nine men do
except wait to die themselves?

01:21:23.049 --> 01:21:29.180
I moved us from the blockade, I set the radio
broadcasting and I promised them women.

01:21:33.518 --> 01:21:35.895
Because women mean a future.

01:21:43.903 --> 01:21:45.988
Selena! Hannah!

01:21:46.739 --> 01:21:48.533
- What is it?
- We have to go.

01:21:48.616 --> 01:21:50.701
- Jim, wait!
- No time! Come on!

01:21:53.663 --> 01:21:55.706
Come on!

01:21:56.833 --> 01:21:58.793
We get in the car and we go!

01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:04.715
No! You're not going to keep them here!
You've got to let them go!

01:22:04.799 --> 01:22:08.052
You can't keep them here!
Stay where you are!

01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:10.847
I'm not gonna let you keep them here!

01:22:10.930 --> 01:22:12.849
You can't do this!

01:22:15.434 --> 01:22:17.728
Right, get him!

01:22:24.777 --> 01:22:27.113
I want to give you a chance.

01:22:27.196 --> 01:22:29.323
You can be with us.

01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:33.244
But I can't let them go.

01:22:38.875 --> 01:22:41.460
OK, Jim? OK.

01:22:46.132 --> 01:22:48.217
Him too.

01:23:01.314 --> 01:23:04.066
<i>Smithers says
"Women and semen don't mix. "</i>

01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:07.069
And Mr Burns says
"We all know what you think, Smithers. "

01:23:07.153 --> 01:23:10.072
<i>And that was my favourite joke
in The Simpsons.</i>

01:23:10.156 --> 01:23:13.784
That's what they're doing a few
hundred miles away, across the Channel,

01:23:13.868 --> 01:23:18.289
<i>across the Atlantic. Eating dinner
and watching the fucking Simpsons!</i>

01:23:18.372 --> 01:23:21.667
They're sleeping in their beds
next to their wives.

01:23:21.751 --> 01:23:27.465
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator
because the OC has gone insane!

01:23:28.508 --> 01:23:32.553
Starting the world again when the rest
of the world hasn't even stopped.

01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:37.058
Just imagine, just think about it.

01:23:38.100 --> 01:23:40.394
How could Infection cross the oceans?

01:23:40.478 --> 01:23:44.774
How could it cross the mountains
and the rivers? It can be stopped.

01:23:44.857 --> 01:23:47.568
Right now TVs are playing
and planes are flying

01:23:47.652 --> 01:23:51.656
and the rest of the world
is continuing as fucking normal.

01:23:51.739 --> 01:23:55.076
<i>Think! Actually think about it.</i>

01:23:55.952 --> 01:23:59.539
What would you do
with a diseased little island?

01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:05.795
They quarantined us.

01:24:08.297 --> 01:24:12.677
"There is no Infection.
It's just people killing people. " He's insane!

01:24:21.477 --> 01:24:23.938
Time to go.

01:24:25.314 --> 01:24:27.400
Quarantine?

01:24:59.223 --> 01:25:02.351
- Please...
- Believe me, I'm not interested.

01:25:03.436 --> 01:25:08.566
You see, I'm gonna have the black one.
And I'm gonna make her squirm.

01:25:08.649 --> 01:25:12.570
Mitchell, I swear to God
it's gonna end badly for you.

01:25:12.653 --> 01:25:14.363
Move.

01:25:14.447 --> 01:25:16.324
Come on, move! Get up!

01:25:16.407 --> 01:25:18.493
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!

01:25:18.576 --> 01:25:20.119
Get up!

01:25:20.203 --> 01:25:22.455
Move your fucking arse!

01:25:43.476 --> 01:25:46.896
<i>Come on then,
you fucking pansies. Do me first.</i>

01:25:46.979 --> 01:25:49.482
<i>No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat.</i>

01:25:49.565 --> 01:25:52.610
<i>- So you're gonna stick me?
- Shoot 'em!</i>

01:25:52.693 --> 01:25:55.363
<i>- Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker!</i>

01:25:55.446 --> 01:25:58.491
<i>Is that how you'd let
your sergeant go out, Jones?</i>

01:25:58.574 --> 01:26:00.493
- I'll shoot them!
- No, you won't.

01:26:00.576 --> 01:26:04.038
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?

01:26:07.667 --> 01:26:09.544
I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:26:13.339 --> 01:26:17.301
You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
You wanna shoot me?

01:26:17.385 --> 01:26:21.556
- You wanna shoot me? I'll kill you!
- Where's he fucking gone?

01:26:22.807 --> 01:26:25.643
Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!

01:26:28.146 --> 01:26:31.357
- Jones, move it!
- I can see him! I can see him!

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.526
Where are you?

01:26:41.117 --> 01:26:43.035
- Can you see him?
- Through there!

01:26:51.794 --> 01:26:54.297
Oh no. We're fucked.

01:26:55.465 --> 01:26:56.966
We're fucked!

01:26:57.049 --> 01:26:58.426
Relax.

01:26:58.509 --> 01:27:01.971
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.

01:27:02.054 --> 01:27:04.807
And no shooter.

01:27:04.891 --> 01:27:06.225
He's dead.

01:27:41.010 --> 01:27:44.972
<i>The first thing we're going to do
is make you look more presentable.</i>

01:27:45.056 --> 01:27:48.643
The lady of the house
has an extensive wardrobe

01:27:48.726 --> 01:27:51.270
which she certainly has no use for.

01:27:52.271 --> 01:27:54.106
You can't do it to Hannah.

01:27:54.190 --> 01:27:57.902
Go to the master bedroom,
pick out a wide selection.

01:27:57.985 --> 01:28:00.071
Yes, sir.

01:28:03.449 --> 01:28:05.535
<i>No...</i>

01:28:06.577 --> 01:28:08.663
<i>Ladies...</i>

01:28:11.415 --> 01:28:14.210
- It's only dressing up!
- No! Selena!

01:28:14.293 --> 01:28:17.630
- I thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.

01:28:17.713 --> 01:28:19.340
<i>Selena!</i>

01:28:19.423 --> 01:28:21.509
Whoa, whoa, relax!

01:28:22.593 --> 01:28:24.178
Selena!

01:28:31.894 --> 01:28:34.355
Selena! Selena!

01:28:36.399 --> 01:28:40.528
You need to leave me alone
with Hannah. OK?

01:28:42.405 --> 01:28:46.117
- Listen, right. The OC wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.

01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:50.371
If you want us to get changed,
you have to leave the room. OK?

01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:03.718
It's just polite.

01:29:09.682 --> 01:29:12.226
Yeah, all right.

01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:14.061
All right.

01:29:14.145 --> 01:29:17.023
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.

01:29:40.087 --> 01:29:44.050
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, OK?
Come on. Eat these.

01:29:44.133 --> 01:29:46.302
Are you trying to kill me?

01:29:46.427 --> 01:29:48.638
No, sweetheart.

01:29:48.721 --> 01:29:51.265
I'm making you not care. OK?

01:29:52.558 --> 01:29:54.811
What you doing?!

01:29:59.357 --> 01:30:01.859
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim!

01:30:01.943 --> 01:30:03.152
Move!

01:30:03.236 --> 01:30:05.905
Stay here and put the dresses on.

01:30:05.988 --> 01:30:07.532
Let's go! Go!

01:30:11.744 --> 01:30:14.330
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.

01:30:14.413 --> 01:30:17.083
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.

01:32:25.628 --> 01:32:27.713
Davis?

01:33:02.415 --> 01:33:04.250
Fuck it!

01:33:55.968 --> 01:33:59.138
- What was that?
- Lightning.

01:34:00.056 --> 01:34:02.141
I heard something.

01:34:04.393 --> 01:34:06.854
It sounded like a Claymore to me.

01:34:07.897 --> 01:34:11.859
All right, I'll go and hit the floods,
take a butcher's.

01:34:12.652 --> 01:34:14.529
Girls,

01:34:14.612 --> 01:34:17.240
keep an eye on him, will ya?

01:34:27.917 --> 01:34:30.336
Those pills,

01:34:30.419 --> 01:34:32.922
I think they're having an effect.

01:34:33.005 --> 01:34:35.508
I can feel them. And...

01:34:36.634 --> 01:34:39.011
I don't feel sleepy.

01:34:39.095 --> 01:34:41.180
But...

01:34:44.058 --> 01:34:46.561
They've been a long time.

01:34:48.479 --> 01:34:51.357
What are you gonna do
if they don't come back?

01:34:52.108 --> 01:34:55.194
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?

01:34:55.278 --> 01:34:57.280
Is that the way it works?

01:34:57.363 --> 01:34:59.448
Shut up.

01:35:00.825 --> 01:35:04.912
I don't think they are coming back.
I think they've been killed.

01:35:04.996 --> 01:35:07.582
- I said shut up!
- Hannah...

01:35:09.167 --> 01:35:11.252
They're dead.

01:35:12.295 --> 01:35:14.797
And you're gonna be next.

01:35:20.970 --> 01:35:23.264
- Get up!
- Whoa!

01:35:23.848 --> 01:35:26.976
We're gonna get out of here.
Stay with it, Hannah.

01:35:27.059 --> 01:35:29.896
Don't worry. I feel fine. Really.

01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:33.274
Get him off me!

01:35:34.484 --> 01:35:36.777
Get him off me!

01:35:38.654 --> 01:35:40.573
It's Jones! It's Jones!

01:35:51.959 --> 01:35:57.507
Oi! Where the fuck are you going?
What's all the fucking shouting about?

01:36:05.473 --> 01:36:08.851
Don't just stand there,
you soppy cunt! Get after them!

01:36:08.935 --> 01:36:10.937
You two, in there! Move!

01:36:29.247 --> 01:36:31.207
Come on, then!

01:36:31.290 --> 01:36:34.252
What the fuck you gonna do now?

01:36:54.939 --> 01:36:57.066
Come on up!

01:36:57.984 --> 01:36:59.694
Col!

01:37:00.820 --> 01:37:04.574
- Defend these stairs with your fucking life!
- Hannah!

01:37:04.657 --> 01:37:06.784
- Mailer's loose.
- Hannah!

01:38:19.065 --> 01:38:21.150
Sorry...

01:38:27.573 --> 01:38:29.659
- Sir...
- Shh.

01:38:33.329 --> 01:38:35.414
Shh.

01:38:58.688 --> 01:39:00.773
Hannah?

01:39:48.488 --> 01:39:50.573
Hannah?

01:39:50.656 --> 01:39:52.158
Selena?

01:40:03.294 --> 01:40:07.673
I haven't got any bullets.
I haven't got any fucking bullets!

01:40:12.136 --> 01:40:14.806
Don't fucking leave me!

01:40:59.934 --> 01:41:01.686
Come on!

01:41:03.646 --> 01:41:05.690
Move!

01:41:05.773 --> 01:41:08.401
Move! Move!

01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:15.867
It's just you and me now, darlin'.
But don't worry, I'll get you out of here.

01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:20.413
Then we'll find a nice little fucking place
somewhere. Just you and me.

01:41:20.496 --> 01:41:22.832
And we'll live happy ever after, eh?

01:42:27.188 --> 01:42:29.690
That was longer than a heartbeat.

01:42:32.527 --> 01:42:34.612
Jim?

01:42:43.955 --> 01:42:47.500
Listen. Listen. It's not all fucked.

01:42:53.256 --> 01:42:55.758
We're gonna be OK. It's not all fucked.

01:42:55.842 --> 01:42:59.178
- I've got to explain something.
- Shut up.

01:42:59.929 --> 01:43:02.223
It's gonna be OK.

01:43:07.687 --> 01:43:11.274
Hannah, it's OK! He's not infected.

01:43:11.357 --> 01:43:13.442
But I thought he was biting you.

01:43:13.526 --> 01:43:16.195
I was kissing her. Are you stoned?

01:43:16.279 --> 01:43:18.447
<i>It's a long story.</i>

01:43:18.531 --> 01:43:20.658
We have to get out of here. Come on!

01:43:23.452 --> 01:43:25.538
Come on! Move!

01:43:32.545 --> 01:43:34.714
You killed all my boys.

01:43:34.797 --> 01:43:36.466
Wait...

01:43:43.848 --> 01:43:45.349
Hannah!

01:43:45.433 --> 01:43:47.059
Hannah? Hannah!

01:43:48.728 --> 01:43:50.938
Hannah!

01:44:07.079 --> 01:44:08.664
Get in.

01:44:27.642 --> 01:44:29.435
They're locked.

01:44:29.519 --> 01:44:31.938
The gates are locked!

01:44:34.565 --> 01:44:36.651
Fucking do it!

01:44:58.965 --> 01:45:01.384
Come on, Jim, breathe! Fucking breathe!

01:45:22.155 --> 01:45:24.448
Not the curtains as well.

01:46:35.102 --> 01:46:37.772
You looked all right in this, you know.

01:46:38.981 --> 01:46:40.483
It's coming!

01:46:57.166 --> 01:46:59.335
- You definitely heard it?
- Yeah!

01:46:59.418 --> 01:47:02.755
- I can't hear anything!
- I told you, I heard it!

01:47:23.234 --> 01:47:25.069
Go.

01:47:58.227 --> 01:48:01.147
Do you think he saw us this time?
