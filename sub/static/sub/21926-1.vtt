00:30.572 --> 00:33.324
I think of all the things
that have been written about me...

00:33.992 --> 00:36.244
that I am an inhuman female demon,

00:37.162 --> 00:39.205
that I am an innocent victim
of a blackguard,

00:39.289 --> 00:42.000
forced against my will
and in danger of my own life,

00:43.376 --> 00:45.545
that I was too ignorant to know how to act

00:45.628 --> 00:48.131
and that to hang me
would be judicial murder,

00:48.923 --> 00:52.886
that I am well and decently dressed,
that I robbed a dead woman to appear so,

00:53.511 --> 00:56.514
that I am of a sullen disposition
with a quarrelsome temper,

00:58.433 --> 01:01.895
that I have the appearance of a person
rather above my humble station,

01:02.687 --> 01:04.647
that I am a good girl
with a pliable nature

01:04.731 --> 01:06.649
and no harm is told of me,

01:07.734 --> 01:09.444
that I am cunning and devious,

01:12.155 --> 01:15.241
that I am soft in the head
and little better than an idiot.

01:16.826 --> 01:20.622
And I wonder, how can I be
all these different things at once?

02:27.730 --> 02:31.860
I  have been an inmate of the
Kingston Penitentiary for 15 long years.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.529
I was convicted of murder
when I was a young girl,

02:34.612 --> 02:37.282
though at the time,
I thought of myself as a grown woman.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.744
Every day I am brought
to the governor's house.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.164
They say I am there
to do light housework.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.415
Come, come, ladies.

02:45.498 --> 02:48.001
Though mostly I am there to be
an object of curiosity.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.714
They stare without appearing to, Doctor,
out from under their bonnets.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.968
The reason they want to see me
is that I am a celebrated murderess.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.512
For that is what has been written down.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.348
When I first saw it, I was surprised,

03:02.432 --> 03:07.103
because they say "celebrated singer"
and "celebrated poetess"

03:07.186 --> 03:08.438
and "celebrated actress,"

03:08.521 --> 03:11.149
but what is there to celebrate
about a murder?

03:13.318 --> 03:17.655
All the same, "murderess" is a strong word
to have attached to you.

03:18.489 --> 03:22.827
It has a smell to it, that word,
musky and oppressive,

03:22.911 --> 03:24.621
like dead flowers in a vase.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.415
Sometimes at night,
I whisper it over to myself:

03:27.498 --> 03:30.084
"Murderess! Murderess!"

03:30.960 --> 03:33.630
It rustles like a taffeta skirt
across the floor.

03:34.631 --> 03:38.343
"Murderer" is merely brutal.
It's like a hammer, or a lump of metal.

03:42.847 --> 03:47.352
I'd rather be a murderess than a murderer,
if those are the only choices.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.695
There was much excitement
about you coming to Kingston, Dr. Jordan.

03:58.863 --> 04:00.698
Those who wanted to see me pardoned

04:00.782 --> 04:03.451
believed that a report from you
could set me free.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.663
You were much better regarded
than the other doctors

04:06.746 --> 04:08.623
who came to examine me over the years.

04:08.706 --> 04:12.043
Hold still, Grace. Dr. Smith needs
to get a proper measurement.

04:12.126 --> 04:13.670
There's nothing to be afraid of.

04:23.846 --> 04:27.100
They thought you could find answers
where others could not.

04:56.546 --> 05:00.550
I'd be careful if I were you.
She's murdered two people in cold blood.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.844
She's in here for good reason.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.359
Good morning, Grace.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.611
I understand you're afraid of doctors.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.656
I must tell you right away
that I myself am a doctor.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.076
My name is Dr. Jordan.
Dr. Simon Jordan.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.039
I suppose you're here to measure my head.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.791
I would not dream of it.

05:36.627 --> 05:39.714
Are you American,
the doctor they brought to write a report?

05:40.506 --> 05:43.676
-Yes.
-Do you have a bag with knives in it?

05:43.760 --> 05:48.139
No. I'm not the usual kind of doctor.
I do no cutting open.

05:48.514 --> 05:49.974
Are you afraid of me, Grace?

05:51.309 --> 05:53.227
It's too early to tell.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.734
This is for you.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.452
I'm not a dog.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.457
No, Grace, I can see you're not a dog.

06:19.045 --> 06:19.921
What is it, Grace?

06:21.672 --> 06:23.591
It has such an odor of the outdoors.

06:24.884 --> 06:26.302
Can you tell me what it is?

06:29.055 --> 06:31.307
-An apple.
-And what does an apple remind you of?

06:33.643 --> 06:34.811
Who shall we marry?

06:40.483 --> 06:42.527
I beg your pardon, sir.
I don't understand you.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.237
I think you understand me well enough.

06:44.946 --> 06:45.947
Apple pie.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.575
-Ah. Something you eat.
-Well, I should hope you would, sir.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.202
That's what an apple is for.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.039
And is there any kind of apple
you should not eat?

06:56.457 --> 06:58.292
A rotten one, I suppose.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.295
Are you a preacher?

07:03.214 --> 07:04.924
No. I'm not a preacher.

07:05.007 --> 07:08.469
I am a doctor that works not with bodies,
but with the mind.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.722
Diseases of the mind and the brain,
and the nerves.

07:14.475 --> 07:18.146
No. I won't go back there to the asylum.

07:18.229 --> 07:20.481
--Flesh and blood cannot stand it.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.361
They took liberties, sir.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.656
They don't listen to reason there, sir.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.538
And that is what I am here for.
To listen to reason.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.335
But if I am to listen to you,
you will have to talk to me.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.545
You won't believe me, sir.

07:42.628 --> 07:46.632
Anyway, it's all been decided,
and what I say will not change anything.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.510
You should ask the lawyers and judges
and the newspaper men,

07:49.594 --> 07:52.054
they seem to know my story
better than I do myself.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.142
In any case, I've lost that part
of my memory entirely.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.477
They must have told you that.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.397
I would like to help you, Grace.

08:02.106 --> 08:04.317
If you will try to talk,
I will try to listen.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.027
My interest is purely scientific.

08:06.110 --> 08:08.654
It is not only the murders
that should concern us.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.616
-Perhaps I'll tell you lies.
-Perhaps you will.

08:11.699 --> 08:13.618
Perhaps you will tell them
without meaning to,

08:13.701 --> 08:16.746
perhaps you will tell them deliberately.
Perhaps you are a liar.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.623
There are those who said I am one.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.960
That is a chance we'll have to take.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.838
Will they take me back to the asylum?

08:30.801 --> 08:34.055
Or will they keep me in solitary
confinement with nothing to eat but bread?

08:35.556 --> 08:38.726
You have my word that as long as you
continue to talk with me

08:38.809 --> 08:41.687
and do not become violent,
you will remain as you were.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.023
I have the governor's promise.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.244
Till tomorrow then.

09:24.605 --> 09:28.025
The apple of the Tree of Knowledge
is what you meant, Dr. Jordan.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.070
Good and Evil.
Any child could guess it.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.495
I thought, he wishes to go home
and say to himself,

09:39.579 --> 09:44.750
"I stuck in my thumb and pulled out
a plum, what a good boy am I."

09:44.834 --> 09:46.752
But I will not be anybody's plum.

09:46.836 --> 09:50.464
You're a doctor's whore now,
aren't you, Grace Marks?

09:50.548 --> 09:51.549
A doctor's whore.

09:51.632 --> 09:52.717
Quiet!

10:10.943 --> 10:13.863
What did you discover today
when you examined Grace?

10:13.946 --> 10:18.159
I believe in pursuing the patient's
sublimated dreams and memories.

10:18.242 --> 10:22.496
It is important to build trust
and this does not happen in one sitting.

10:22.580 --> 10:26.792
Mm. There are a great number of us,

10:26.876 --> 10:30.630
especially those of us on the committee
to pardon Grace Marks,

10:30.713 --> 10:34.800
who are anxious to see Grace released
as soon as possible.

10:34.884 --> 10:38.387
She has languished too long in prison
for one so young

10:38.471 --> 10:41.349
and vulnerable at the time
of her conviction.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.268
When can our committee
expect to see your report?

10:47.438 --> 10:50.858
I have some questions
about the trial itself.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.821
I went to the pump, and on turning around,
I saw McDermott

10:55.905 --> 10:58.783
dragging Nancy along the yard leading from
the back kitchen to the front kitchen.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.826
Grace said
at the time of her arrest

11:00.910 --> 11:03.704
that she didn't know where Nancy was.

11:04.246 --> 11:07.041
-But at the trial itself...
-He said, "Better to get it done with.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.127
Open the trap door
and I'll throw her down in the cellar."

11:10.211 --> 11:13.089
...she claimed to have seen McDermott
dragging Nancy by the hair

11:13.172 --> 11:14.590
and tossing her down the stairs.

11:16.550 --> 11:20.012
Did she? I don't recall.

11:20.096 --> 11:23.057
She did say she was sorry
that Nancy was dead.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.643
-Anyone might say that.
-I suppose.

11:27.269 --> 11:31.816
Also we have McDermott's statement,
made just before he was hanged.

11:37.655 --> 11:41.492
He claimed that Grace strangled Nancy
with her own kerchief.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.204
The man had already told
several different stories

11:45.287 --> 11:47.623
and was a notorious liar
into the bargain.

11:47.706 --> 11:51.919
Grace Marks made me do it!
She's a whore.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.004
Murderer!

11:54.088 --> 11:56.340
- To turn Devil's advocate...
- Hang her!

11:56.424 --> 12:01.595
...just because a man is known to lie,
it does not always follow that he does so.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.476
Is this type of inquiry bothering you?

12:07.560 --> 12:10.271
Hm. Not at all, Dr. Jordan.

12:10.354 --> 12:14.358
But we are hoping you will write a report
favorable to Grace Marks.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.777
That is why we have brought you here.

12:17.987 --> 12:21.740
-Yes, I appreciate that.
-So when can we see your report?

12:24.660 --> 12:27.079
It would be helpful
if I could meet with Grace

12:27.163 --> 12:29.498
in a setting that implied more trust.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.711
You mentioned she'd been doing housework
for the governor of the penitentiary.

12:33.794 --> 12:35.713
How did this come about?

12:35.796 --> 12:37.965
Her behavior in prison
was exemplary

12:38.048 --> 12:41.552
and the governor's wife allowed her
to spend her days there.

12:41.635 --> 12:45.890
But recently she did have a fit there,
which terrified the family.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.822
Would it be possible to persuade them
to allow her back into the house?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.742
- I could meet with her there.
- I shall try.

13:04.825 --> 13:09.622
She has a liking for Grace,
and no doubt she enjoys

13:09.705 --> 13:13.918
the curiosity that Grace arouses
in the ladies of the spiritualist circle.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.921
-I feel something coming.
-Shh, shh, shh.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.715
We will wait
for your dear son William.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.800
So I'll meet Grace tomorrow
at the governor's house?

13:21.884 --> 13:26.180
I'm sure I can arrange it.
And how are your accommodations?

13:26.263 --> 13:28.724
Very satisfactory.
Thank you for all your efforts, Reverend.

13:28.807 --> 13:32.561
We feel certain it will be worth
our while. I'll see you tomorrow.

13:34.980 --> 13:35.981
Mrs. Humphrey.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.400
Good evening.
I have made you some tea.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.860
How very kind of you.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.113
-Good night, Dr. Jordan.
-Good night, Reverend.

13:49.495 --> 13:54.083
Well, Grace, I see you've got
a new sweetheart, a doctor no less.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.753
He'd better keep a sharp eye out
or you'll have him flat on his back.

13:58.170 --> 14:02.424
Flat on his back in the cellar with his
boots off and a bullet through his heart.

14:03.717 --> 14:06.637
If you really thought that of me,
you should hold your dirty tongues,

14:06.720 --> 14:09.306
or one dark night I'll have them
out of your mouths,

14:09.390 --> 14:13.185
and I won't need a knife, I'll just
take hold with my teeth and pull.

14:14.228 --> 14:17.189
I'll thank you to keep
your filthy screw's hands to yourself.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.732
There are some that take pleasure

14:18.816 --> 14:20.442
in the distress
of a fellow mortal, Doctor,

14:21.861 --> 14:25.364
and most especially if they think
that fellow mortal has committed a sin,

14:25.447 --> 14:27.116
which adds an extra relish.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.159
As lively as a rooster
with its neck fresh wrung.

14:29.243 --> 14:32.162
But which among us has not sinned,
as the Bible tells us?

14:33.706 --> 14:37.126
I should be ashamed of myself to take
such delight in the suffering of others.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.986
It's difficult for me to begin talking.

15:04.069 --> 15:08.240
I've not talked very much in 15 years.
I don't know what you want me to say.

15:08.324 --> 15:12.286
It's what you want to say to yourself
that's of interest to me.

15:14.955 --> 15:19.668
I have no wants of that kind.
It isn't my place to want to say anything.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.089
Tell me about the quilt you're making.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.678
It's for Lydia, the governor's daughter.
It's a log cabin quilt.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.349
Every young woman
should have one before marriage.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.516
It means the home,

15:34.600 --> 15:38.812
and at the center there's always
a red square, which means the hearth fire.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.940
This one's for everyday,
not as fancy as marriage quilts.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.900
What are the marriage quilts?

15:44.276 --> 15:45.736
Well, according to my friend,

15:45.819 --> 15:49.239
there are three quilts every woman
should make before her marriage:

15:49.949 --> 15:54.328
the Tree of Paradise, the Flower Basket
and the Pandora's Box.

15:54.411 --> 15:59.041
Sometimes, in my days as a maid,
I would hang them up to dry all in a row.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.503
They'd look like flags
hung out by an army as it goes to war.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.505
What else does that
make you think of, Grace?

16:04.588 --> 16:06.882
Well, since that time, I've thought,

16:07.758 --> 16:12.221
why have women chosen to sew such flags
and lay them on the tops of beds?

16:12.930 --> 16:15.307
For they make the bed
the most noticeable thing in a room.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.979
And then I thought, it's for a warning.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.947
Because you may think a bed
is a peaceful thing, sir.

16:30.030 --> 16:32.908
To you it may mean rest and comfort
and a good night's sleep.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.743
But it isn't so for everyone.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.371
There are many dangerous things
that may take place in a bed.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.542
It's where we are born,
that's our first peril in life.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.545
It's where women give birth,
which is often their last.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.297
And it's where the act takes place
between men and women, sir,

16:47.381 --> 16:50.634
that I will not mention to you,
but I suppose you know what it is.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.513
Some call it love, others despair,

16:55.305 --> 16:57.766
or merely an indignity
they must suffer through.

16:59.768 --> 17:03.480
And finally beds are what we sleep in,
and where we dream,

17:05.232 --> 17:06.483
and often where we die.

17:11.321 --> 17:14.908
But I did not have these fancies about
quilts until after I was in prison...

17:15.492 --> 17:18.829
where you have a lot of time to think,
and no one to tell your thoughts to,

17:19.663 --> 17:22.332
and so you tell them to yourself.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.127
So, Grace, you consider a bed to be
a dangerous place?

17:28.505 --> 17:31.800
-Are you laughing at me, sir?
-No.

17:33.427 --> 17:36.847
Of course I don't think it's a dangerous
place every time you get into it, sir.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.850
Only on those occasions
which I have mentioned.

17:40.851 --> 17:44.480
Have I offended you somehow?
I did not intend to.

17:45.981 --> 17:49.902
Then I will take you at your word and hope
such will be returned in the future.

17:52.905 --> 17:53.906
Of course.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.659
Can you tell me what this is, Grace?

17:59.244 --> 18:01.288
-It's a beet.
-Does it remind you of anything?

18:09.213 --> 18:11.173
A Sunday roast, I suppose.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.927
Always best to peel beets after they come
out of the oven and not before.

18:15.010 --> 18:16.553
They can be very hard to clean.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.014
Boiled beets don't have
the same flavor at all.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.058
They're a hard vegetable
to clean a stain from.

18:34.154 --> 18:38.325
If you could make a quilt for yourself,
which pattern would you make?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.871
I don't know, sir.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.333
Perhaps it would be a Job's Tears,
or a Tree of Paradise.

18:46.416 --> 18:50.337
Or maybe an Old Maid's Puzzle, because
I am an old maid, wouldn't you say, sir,

18:50.420 --> 18:52.965
and I've certainly been very puzzled.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.306
You must have thought about what pattern
you would make,

19:01.390 --> 19:04.935
having spent so many years
making them for others.

19:05.018 --> 19:08.730
Saying what you want brings bad luck, sir;
then the good thing will never happen.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.733
You should be careful wanting anything,
as you may be punished for it.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.236
-This is what happened to Mary Whitney.
-Who's Mary Whitney?

19:14.319 --> 19:16.613
-A friend.
-And how did you know her?

19:18.365 --> 19:20.576
It was a long time ago.
It isn't important, really.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.202
Grace, you may be frank with me.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.329
I have no reason not to be frank, sir.

19:25.289 --> 19:30.002
A lady may conceal things, as she has her
reputation to lose, but I am beyond that.

19:30.878 --> 19:34.339
I can say anything, or if I don't wish to,
I needn't say anything at all.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.552
You don't care
about my good opinion of you, Grace?

19:38.635 --> 19:42.014
I've already been judged, sir.
Whatever you may think, it's all the same.

19:42.097 --> 19:43.265
Judged rightly, Grace?

19:43.348 --> 19:47.728
Rightly or wrongly does not matter.
People want a guilty person.

19:48.437 --> 19:51.607
If there has been a crime,
they want to know who did it.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.734
-Then you've given up hope?
-Hope of what, sir?

19:55.903 --> 19:59.156
Well, hope of being set free.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.534
Now, why would they want to do that, sir?

20:02.618 --> 20:04.786
A murderess is not an everyday thing.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.206
I save my hopes for smaller matters,

20:07.289 --> 20:09.791
in hopes of having a better breakfast
tomorrow than I had today.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.879
They said at the time they were
making an example of me.

20:13.962 --> 20:17.424
That's why it was the death sentence,
and then the life sentence.

20:17.507 --> 20:20.636
But what does an example do afterwards?
The story is over.

20:20.719 --> 20:24.723
How do you fill in the rest of your time?
Do you feel you've been treated unjustly?

20:27.643 --> 20:29.561
I don't know what you mean, sir.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.443
Well, there's more than one way
to skin a cat.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.655
An odd choice of words, sir,
I'm not a cat.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.241
-I remember, nor are you a dog.
-I beg your pardon, sir.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.035
-Let us begin at the beginning.
-Of what, sir?

20:45.118 --> 20:48.038
-The beginning of your life.
-I was born, sir, like anyone else.

20:49.248 --> 20:53.001
I have your confession here.
Let me read what you said in it.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.461
That is not really my confession.

20:55.170 --> 20:58.715
It's what lawyers told me to say,
and the things made up by the newspapers.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.385
The first time I set eyes
on a newspaper man,

21:01.468 --> 21:03.470
I thought, "Does your mother
know you're out?"

21:03.553 --> 21:05.639
They wouldn't know the truth
if they fell over it.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.182
Grace, who is Mary Whitney?

21:07.266 --> 21:10.811
It is written underneath your portrait
at the front of your confession.

21:10.894 --> 21:13.897
"Grace Marks, alias Mary Whitney."

21:14.481 --> 21:17.234
-Oh, yes. It's not a good likeness of me.
-And Mary Whitney?

21:17.317 --> 21:19.987
That was the name I gave when McDermott
was running away with me.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.281
You gave any name
that came into your head?

21:23.407 --> 21:27.077
Oh, no, sir. Mary Whitney was once
a particular friend of mine.

21:27.869 --> 21:31.540
She was dead, sir, and I did not think
she would mind if I used her name.

21:31.623 --> 21:33.458
She sometimes lent me her clothing too.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.878
She was always very kind to me.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.132
And without her, it would have been
a different story entirely.

21:40.215 --> 21:41.591
Will you tell me your story, Grace?

21:41.675 --> 21:45.429
The real one is not in your confession,
as you say. Will you tell me?

21:45.512 --> 21:48.265
-What part of it, sir?
-From the beginning.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.987
What it says at the beginning
of my confession is true enough.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.781
I did indeed come
from the north of Ireland,

22:05.699 --> 22:08.076
though I thought it very unjust
when they wrote down

22:08.160 --> 22:10.871
that "both of the accused were
from Ireland by their own admission."

22:11.455 --> 22:15.584
That made it sound like a crime, and I
don't know being from Ireland is a crime,

22:15.667 --> 22:17.252
though I've seen it treated as such.

22:19.254 --> 22:22.591
But our family were Protestants,
and that is different.

22:25.343 --> 22:27.387
We left Ireland with little warning.

22:28.096 --> 22:31.933
My father was English and while in Ireland
he got into the company

22:32.017 --> 22:33.602
of some Orangemen of bad reputation,

22:34.394 --> 22:36.855
and there was a house burnt down
of a Protestant gentleman

22:36.938 --> 22:38.607
that had taken the side
of the Catholics...

22:38.690 --> 22:40.317
Get up. Be quick about it.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.569
...and another one found
with his head bashed in.

22:43.695 --> 22:44.863
We left rather quickly.

22:44.946 --> 22:48.492
Why did God saddle me with such a litter
of thieving Irish scoundrels?

22:48.575 --> 22:50.118
The world doesn't need more of you.

22:50.202 --> 22:53.163
You should all have been drowned
like kittens in a sack.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.459
Stupid woman!

22:59.795 --> 23:00.837
Michael, Claire.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.053
Come, pick it up!

23:15.560 --> 23:17.187
I will confess to a wicked thought.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.108
When I had the young ones
all lined up, I thought,

23:21.858 --> 23:24.611
I might just push one or two of them over,

23:24.694 --> 23:28.281
and then there would not be so many
to feed, nor so many clothes to wash.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.787
I thought maybe I could spare them
this life with this man.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.917
But it was just a thought,
put into my head by the Devil, no doubt.

23:39.709 --> 23:44.172
Or more likely by my father, for at
that age I was still trying to please him.

24:01.022 --> 24:02.816
Three crows in a row mean death.

24:04.484 --> 24:06.403
My foot will never touch land again.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.865
Mother, why do you say that?

24:11.700 --> 24:13.451
I feel it in my bones.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.372
And so it turned out.

24:37.392 --> 24:40.478
My father spent most of the voyage
passed out from drink.

24:41.271 --> 24:44.566
Through the storms and sickness,
we barely knew where he was.

24:44.649 --> 24:45.775
Which was just as well.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.528
There was more than enough suffering
without him.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.692
I thought of Jonah
in the belly of the whale,

25:28.610 --> 25:31.238
but at least he only had
to stay there three days,

25:31.321 --> 25:33.365
and we had eight weeks ahead of us.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.785
And he was in the belly all by himself

25:36.868 --> 25:39.454
and did not have to listen
to the moaning of others.

25:43.750 --> 25:46.628
I did not mean to offend
your sensibilities, sir.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.091
The ship was, after all, only a slum
in motion, though without the gin shops.

25:51.758 --> 25:54.219
And I hear they have better ships now.

25:54.302 --> 25:55.887
Perhaps you'd like to open a window.

26:04.604 --> 26:07.649
O come hither
and behold the works of God.

26:11.653 --> 26:15.907
He turned the sea into dry land so that
they went through the water on foot.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.325
There did we rejoice.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.869
The passengers were Catholics
and Protestants mixed.

26:19.953 --> 26:23.790
In health, they would have squabbled
and fought, as there is no love lost.

26:23.873 --> 26:27.544
A sea voyage may be God's reminder to us
that we are all flesh,

26:27.627 --> 26:29.254
and all flesh is weak.

26:29.337 --> 26:31.631
There is no way to avoid
attending both, I suppose.

26:34.592 --> 26:37.095
No one seems to object
while they're on water.

26:43.643 --> 26:48.606
...for thou, O God, hath proved us.
Thou hast also tried us.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.783
My stomach, Grace.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.186
It is not cholera,
which will be a relief to the captain.

27:26.269 --> 27:28.104
Most likely a tumor.

27:28.938 --> 27:32.859
There's no telling without cutting her
open, and that will kill her for certain.

27:32.942 --> 27:35.737
Can we carry her up on deck for the air?

27:37.572 --> 27:39.407
It would be a mistake to move her.

27:40.950 --> 27:44.954
The air is so foul down here,
I am half choked.

28:35.338 --> 28:36.840
There there.

28:38.341 --> 28:39.801
There there.

28:39.884 --> 28:42.929
Here are some spirits I have for medicine.

28:47.308 --> 28:49.644
It would do you good to cry, girl.

28:49.728 --> 28:53.857
She's in Heaven now with the blessed
saints, even though she was a Protestant.

28:55.608 --> 28:58.319
We have not opened a window
to let the soul out.

29:01.072 --> 29:04.075
Perhaps it will not be counted
against your poor mother.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.578
There are none to be opened down here.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.581
I have never heard of a custom like that.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.092
Each of you, kiss mother goodbye.

29:26.347 --> 29:30.351
We therefore commit this body
to the deep, to be turned into corruption,

29:31.269 --> 29:33.271
looking for the resurrection of the body

29:33.354 --> 29:37.025
and the life of the world to come,
through our Lord Jesus Christ,

29:37.609 --> 29:40.278
who at his coming shall change
our vile body,

29:40.361 --> 29:44.741
that it may be like his glorious body,
according to the mighty working

29:44.824 --> 29:48.995
whereby he is able to subdue
all things to himself.

30:31.329 --> 30:34.999
Imagine that. Your teapot breaks now,
when the waves have calmed down.

30:35.917 --> 30:40.046
My Auntie Pauline gave it to us
just before we left.

30:40.129 --> 30:43.550
No doubt it came untied
when someone tried to steal it.

30:44.843 --> 30:49.097
She's trapped because we couldn't open
a window, just like you said.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.684
Now she'll be caught down here
forever and ever,

30:52.767 --> 30:56.396
sailing back and forth
across this hideous dark ocean.

31:03.486 --> 31:06.072
You see what queer ideas a person can get?

31:08.867 --> 31:11.786
But I was only a young girl at the time,
and very ignorant.

31:11.870 --> 31:15.874
Can you continue, Grace?
What happened when you arrived?

31:45.153 --> 31:48.573
We arrived in Toronto
and the people appeared to be very mixed

31:48.656 --> 31:51.910
as to the kinds of them,
with skins of all hues,

31:51.993 --> 31:53.661
which was very new to me;

31:53.745 --> 31:56.706
and you could never tell what
speech you were going to hear.

31:56.789 --> 31:59.208
Altogether, it was just like
the Tower of Babel.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.206
Get the bloody breakfast on,
you lazy witch.

32:38.998 --> 32:42.961
Unfortunately, it soon became clear that
my father's character would not improve

32:43.044 --> 32:44.837
without my mother there to temper it.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.382
What's taking so long?

32:54.138 --> 32:56.474
You stupid ugly whore!

33:27.922 --> 33:29.340
I'm sorry, Grace.

33:32.719 --> 33:34.220
I wasn't myself.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.308
I don't know what got into me.

34:41.412 --> 34:44.165
I did not want to be led
into sin of that kind,

34:45.291 --> 34:47.668
though I was afraid that
the fiery red anger

34:47.752 --> 34:49.837
in my heart would drive me to it.

35:04.852 --> 35:08.147
It's time you went out to earn
your own bread and send your wages back.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.901
You're eating me out of house and home,
you ungrateful slut.

35:11.984 --> 35:14.112
I've asked the landlady
to find a job for you.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.780
Who will look after the little ones?

35:15.863 --> 35:16.948
Katey.

35:18.032 --> 35:19.075
Katey?

35:19.158 --> 35:22.620
Yes. Now get out and send money back.

35:22.703 --> 35:25.081
Before I box your ears so hard
you can't hear a thing.

36:23.389 --> 36:25.349
I told them I would come back for them.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.603
And at the time, I meant it.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.357
Forgive me, sir, I'm a little tired.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.444
Yes. No wonder.

36:37.570 --> 36:39.238
We'll begin again tomorrow.

36:40.990 --> 36:44.911
Before I go, could you tell me
a little more about Mary Whitney?

36:44.994 --> 36:46.078
You mentioned her earlier.

36:47.455 --> 36:50.416
Well, sir, that will bring me
to a happier part of my story.

36:51.667 --> 36:54.378
And you will see
why it was her name I used.

36:58.341 --> 37:02.053
Our landlady secured me employment
at a fine house in Toronto.

37:04.013 --> 37:08.142
You must be Grace, the new girl.
I'm Mary.

37:09.018 --> 37:12.146
You shouldn't stand here.
I'll take you in the servants' entrance.

37:14.774 --> 37:17.109
You must have had a very long journey.

37:22.281 --> 37:24.700
You won't see much
of Mr. Alderman Parkinson.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.620
When you do, you might be blinded.

37:27.703 --> 37:32.333
He has so many gold pins and snuff boxes
and gold watch chains,

37:32.416 --> 37:35.002
you could get five necklaces
if he were melted down,

37:35.086 --> 37:37.171
with the earrings to match.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.383
Serve cheese biscuits warm.

37:40.466 --> 37:44.595
And give this room
a little more going over.

37:45.471 --> 37:49.892
And make sure that there are four bottles
of good claret for after lunch.

37:50.726 --> 37:52.144
That's Mrs. Parkinson.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.441
She ought to be the alderman herself,
she is a better man.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.778
This is the parlor.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.323
They have two sons.

38:04.407 --> 38:09.287
They're both away in the States
at college, which is just as well.

38:09.370 --> 38:11.414
Mrs. Honey, cook.

38:11.497 --> 38:13.040
This is Grace Marks.

38:18.045 --> 38:21.257
Now I'll show you to your bed,
which is the same as mine.

38:28.222 --> 38:31.225
-Agnes, Effie, this is Grace Marks.
-Hello.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.522
Effie is quite melancholic.

38:37.231 --> 38:40.776
Her young man was transported to Australia
for being in the rebellion

38:40.860 --> 38:42.570
and he died there.

38:42.653 --> 38:45.239
She tried to hang herself
with her apron strings and they broke,

38:45.323 --> 38:48.617
and they found her out of her mind
and she had to be put away.

38:48.701 --> 38:49.785
What rebellion?

38:49.869 --> 38:53.289
What rebellion?
You must have just arrived.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.626
It was against the gentry
who run everything here

38:57.710 --> 39:00.046
and keep all of the land
and the money for themselves.

39:00.129 --> 39:03.007
Mr. William Lyon Mackenzie,
he led the rebellion but it failed,

39:03.090 --> 39:07.178
so he escaped in women's clothing
over the lake and into the States.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.680
He could have been betrayed many times,
but he wasn't,

39:09.764 --> 39:12.641
because he was a fine man
who stood up for the ordinary farmers.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.437
Anyway, it's best not to mention politics.
Except amongst friends.

39:17.313 --> 39:20.858
I don't know anything about politics
so I wouldn't mention it in any case.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.029
Are you a radical?

39:25.863 --> 39:30.034
You're not to tell the Parkinsons.
They've heard a different story from me.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.536
But my father lost his farm.

39:32.620 --> 39:37.291
The government troops burnt the log cabin
that he built while fighting off bears.

39:38.334 --> 39:41.170
And then he died while hiding
in the winter woods,

39:41.253 --> 39:42.755
and my mother died of grief.

39:43.631 --> 39:47.385
But our time will come,
we will be revenged.

39:48.344 --> 39:51.472
She had a very fierce look
when she said this.

39:56.852 --> 40:00.314
Grace, when you get your wages,
you must hide them.

40:00.398 --> 40:04.026
-Made a pocket in the mattress here.
-My wages go directly to my father.

40:04.110 --> 40:08.572
Didn't you say your father was a drunk?
You can't give him your wages.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.534
But what about the children?
How will they survive?

40:11.617 --> 40:13.744
It won't benefit your brothers
and sisters.

40:13.828 --> 40:17.665
-He'll just drink it away.
-I'm afraid of him.

40:19.834 --> 40:24.672
He won't get at you here, and if he tries,
I'll speak with Jim in the stables.

40:24.755 --> 40:26.173
He's a large man with friends.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.469
You may be very young
and as ignorant as an egg,

40:31.887 --> 40:34.682
but you're bright as a new penny,
Grace Marks.

40:35.266 --> 40:38.978
And the difference between ignorant
and stupid is that ignorant can learn.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.398
I think we're gonna get along
just fine together.

40:43.858 --> 40:47.069
In the morning I'll have Miss Honey
advance you your wages

40:47.153 --> 40:49.029
so we can get you a proper dress.

41:09.842 --> 41:12.219
Very sorry to interrupt, Dr. Jordan.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.555
I wanted to know if I could bring
any refreshment.

41:14.638 --> 41:17.391
No, we're fine. Thank you.
We're in the middle of...

41:24.106 --> 41:25.274
Um...

41:25.357 --> 41:26.942
I'm sorry, Doctor. Are we not done?

41:28.861 --> 41:32.198
Yes, yes, of course.
That was quite a lot for one day.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.700
Shall we begin again tomorrow?

41:54.178 --> 41:56.680
I went to the pump,
and on turning around,

41:56.764 --> 41:59.016
I saw McDermott dragging Nancy
along the yard,

41:59.099 --> 42:01.435
leading from the back kitchen
to the front kitchen.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.687
This was about seven o'clock.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.982
I said to McDermott, "I didn't think
you were going to do it that minute."

42:07.816 --> 42:10.486
He said it was better
to get it done with...

42:10.569 --> 42:14.615
In the courtroom, and in the asylum,
every word that came out of my mouth

42:14.698 --> 42:17.368
was as if it was burnt into the paper
they were writing it on.

42:17.451 --> 42:21.205
He said, "Open the trap door
and I'll throw her down in the cellar."

42:21.288 --> 42:24.875
And once I said a thing, I knew
I could never get the words back,

42:24.959 --> 42:26.502
only they were the wrong words...

42:26.585 --> 42:30.381
I gave him a piece of white cloth
and followed him to the trap door.

42:30.464 --> 42:32.967
...'cause whatever I said
would be twisted around,

42:34.969 --> 42:36.804
even if it was the plain truth
in the first place.

42:41.642 --> 42:44.728
But now I feel as if everything
I say is right.

42:44.812 --> 42:47.648
As long as I say something,
anything at all,

42:47.731 --> 42:50.359
you smile and write it down.

42:51.860 --> 42:55.322
When you write, I feel as if you are
drawing on me,

42:55.406 --> 42:59.201
drawing on my skin with the feather end
of an old-fashioned goose pen.

43:00.119 --> 43:03.664
As if hundreds of butterflies
have settled all over my face

43:03.747 --> 43:06.000
and are softly opening
and closing their wings.

43:09.211 --> 43:11.463
But underneath that is another feeling,

43:12.381 --> 43:15.843
a feeling of being wide-eyed awake
and watchful.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.934
It's like being wakened suddenly
in the middle of the night,

43:24.018 --> 43:27.938
by a hand over your face, and you sit up
with your heart going fast,

43:28.022 --> 43:29.690
and no one is there.

43:39.074 --> 43:41.619
And underneath that
is another feeling still...

43:44.079 --> 43:46.081
a feeling of being torn open,

43:46.832 --> 43:52.421
not like a body of flesh, it is not
painful as such, but like a peach.

43:52.880 --> 43:58.177
And not even torn open but too ripe
and splitting of its own accord.

43:58.260 --> 44:02.389
And inside the peach there's a stone.
