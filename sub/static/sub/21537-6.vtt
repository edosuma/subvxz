I LOVE 50 LISPENARD.

00:07.574 --> 00:09.843
I WANT THIS
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

00:09.876 --> 00:11.111

00:15.448 --> 00:16.983

00:17.017 --> 00:19.052
WE HAVE A DEAL.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.221
- READY TO MAKE AN OFFER, OR
ARE YOU READY TO MAKE AN OFFER?

00:21.254 --> 00:23.656
- IT DOESN'T HAVE
ALL THE AMENITIES WE TALK ABOUT.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.758
- I NEED AN OFFER TODAY.

00:24.791 --> 00:25.825
- SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.227
I'M HOPING FOR GOOD NEWS
OVER HERE.

00:27.260 --> 00:28.561
- I JUST NEED ONE MORE WEEK.

00:28.595 --> 00:29.829
- YOU'RE DONE.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.664
TOMORROW MORNING,
I GOT TO FIND SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.066
THIS DEAL IS DEAD.

00:33.099 --> 00:34.534
- IF YOU SIGN WITH ME TODAY,

00:34.567 --> 00:36.403
YOU'RE GONNA GET THAT MONEY
BACK TEN TIMES.

00:36.436 --> 00:37.537
- WE'RE READY TO MOVE AHEAD.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.072
- THANK YOU, FREDRIK.
- APPRECIATE IT.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.974
THE APARTMENT IS AMAZING,
DOUBLE-HEIGHT CEILINGS.

00:41.007 --> 00:42.409
- I'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.
- YOU'VE SEEN THIS?

00:42.442 --> 00:43.610
- BUT NEVER LIKE THIS.

00:43.643 --> 00:45.245
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME
DOING THIS OPEN HOUSE.

00:45.278 --> 00:46.446
I'M VERY IMPRESSED, MAN.

00:46.479 --> 00:48.515
MOST AGENTS
WOULD SEE FREDRIK AS AN ENEMY.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.784
HOWEVER, FOR ME, IT'S ALL ABOUT
LEARNING FROM THE BEST,

00:50.817 --> 00:53.053
AND I THINK HE'S ONE OF 'EM.

00:53.086 --> 00:56.256
[upbeat music]

00:56.289 --> 00:58.692
- MY MOTTO IS EXPANSION...

00:58.725 --> 01:02.295
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

01:02.328 --> 01:05.598
- NEW YORK CITY, IT'S THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

01:05.632 --> 01:06.700
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.069
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

01:09.102 --> 01:11.304
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

01:11.338 --> 01:13.373
- THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
YOU'VE DISRESPECTED ME, BRO.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.541
- HAVE I MET YOU BEFORE?

01:14.574 --> 01:15.542
- I WANTED THIS THING

01:15.575 --> 01:16.976
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE,
AND YOU KNEW IT!

01:17.077 --> 01:18.311
- IT'S OVER!

01:18.345 --> 01:19.879
[upbeat music]

01:30.090 --> 01:32.559
CLOSING WITHIN 30 DAYS,
ALL CASH,

01:32.592 --> 01:33.560
PLEASE, GET IT DONE.

01:33.593 --> 01:34.794
GET IT DONE.
WRAP IT UP.

01:34.828 --> 01:35.862
AND SEND IT OVER.

01:35.895 --> 01:37.530
A FEW WEEKS AGO,
I SOLD A PENTHOUSE

01:37.564 --> 01:38.631
AT 50 LISPENARD.

01:38.665 --> 01:40.266
WELCOME TO 50 LISPENARD.

01:40.300 --> 01:41.835
IT'S $4 MILLION.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.103
AND IT'S A DUPLEX,
TWO BEDROOMS.

01:43.136 --> 01:45.338
I GOT YOU $3.650 MILLION.

01:45.372 --> 01:46.606
- WOW.

01:46.639 --> 01:48.208
THAT'S AWESOME.
- YEH!

01:48.241 --> 01:49.342
AND SINCE THEN,

01:49.376 --> 01:50.744
I'VE BEEN SHOWING
THE LOWER FLOORS

01:50.777 --> 01:52.979
IN THE BUILDING CONSTANTLY.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.381
WELCOME TO 50 LISPENARD.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.851
SO THIS IS THE SECOND FLOOR...

01:57.884 --> 01:59.652
THE FOURTH FLOOR...
FIFTH FLOOR...

01:59.686 --> 02:01.554
AND THE RESPONSE
HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING.

02:01.588 --> 02:03.423
LOOK AT THESE CEILINGS.
- THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.524
- IT'S VERY NICE.

02:04.557 --> 02:06.059
- SPECTACULAR SPACE.

02:06.059 --> 02:10.397
- LAST WEEK, I SOLD BOTH
THE FIFTH AND THE FOURTH FLOOR.

02:10.430 --> 02:11.698
THANK YOU.

02:11.731 --> 02:12.799
DING.

02:12.832 --> 02:14.501
AND NOW I'M FINALIZING THE DEAL

02:14.534 --> 02:15.735
FOR THE THIRD FLOOR.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.404
THIS IS GOOD NEWS.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.372
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET
THE DEPOSIT,

02:19.406 --> 02:23.376
SIGNATURE, AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

02:26.946 --> 02:29.549
YEAH, DONE, DONE, DONE,
WHICH MEANS THAT WE HAVE A DEAL.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.252
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

02:32.285 --> 02:34.187
THANK YOU.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.321
- WOW.
- OOH!

02:35.355 --> 02:36.756
- THAT SOUNDED GOOD.
- 50 LISPENARD?

02:36.790 --> 02:37.757
- YES, 50 LISPENARD.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.559
I MEAN,
WE HAVE ONLY ONE UNIT LEFT.

02:39.592 --> 02:40.827
THAT'S--THAT'S HAPPENING.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.529
- THAT'S GREAT.
- IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

02:42.562 --> 02:44.698
THAT'S FOUR OUT OF FIVE UNITS
IN LESS THAN A MONTH.

02:44.731 --> 02:46.399
I FEEL LIKE AN OLYMPIAN.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.134
I FEEL SO GOOD.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.436
- WE GOT TO CELEBRATE.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.304
- NO, WE'RE NOT DONE
UNTIL WE'RE DONE.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.239
I WANT TO PUT "SOLD OUT"
IN CAPITAL LETTERS

02:53.273 --> 02:54.741
ON THAT LISTING.

02:54.774 --> 02:57.243
I'M ON MY WAY, BUT I STILL HAVE
ONE MORE LEFT TO SELL.

02:57.277 --> 02:58.478
AND WHEN THAT'S GONE,

02:58.511 --> 03:01.614
THAT'S MY 23RD
SOLD-OUT BUILDING.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.717
WHOO!

03:03.750 --> 03:05.218
THAT'S RIGHT.

03:05.251 --> 03:06.653
BACK TO WORK.
GET ON THE PHONE.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.088
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.323
[smooches]

03:17.263 --> 03:18.231
- HEY, BARB.

03:18.264 --> 03:19.432
- HEY.

03:19.466 --> 03:20.433
- [grunts]

03:20.467 --> 03:22.102
HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW ARE YOU?

03:22.135 --> 03:23.503
- BARBARA'S MY NEW CLIENT.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.772
I MET HER HUSBAND
LAST WEEK AT AN OPEN HOUSE.

03:25.805 --> 03:27.640
AND HE JUST GOT A NEW JOB
IN NEW YORK.

03:27.674 --> 03:28.908
AND HE'S LOOKING TO MOVE

03:28.942 --> 03:30.577
WITH HIS WIFE AND TWO KIDS
OUT HERE FROM IDAHO.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.512
DID YOU JUST FLY IN
THIS MORNING OR DID YOU FLY IN--

03:32.545 --> 03:35.115
- I JUST FLEW IN LAST NIGHT
FROM BOISE, IDAHO.

03:35.148 --> 03:36.783
- AND THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR A THREE BEDROOM

03:36.816 --> 03:38.118
BETWEEN $3 MILLION
AND $4 MILLION

03:38.151 --> 03:39.586
ON THE EAST SIDE.

03:39.619 --> 03:40.954
DO YOU HAVE COWBOYS IN IDAHO?

03:40.987 --> 03:41.988
- AND COWGIRLS, RIGHT?

03:42.088 --> 03:43.289
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.392
- I SHOULD WALK AROUND
IN, LIKE, A TOTAL COWBOY GETUP.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.796
[laughs]

03:51.398 --> 03:52.866
IT'S A BUMPY ROAD.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.100
- IT WILL BE.

03:54.134 --> 03:56.102
NO, IT'S A SMOOTH RIDE,
SMOOTH RIDE WITH ME.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.103
- [chuckles]

03:57.137 --> 03:58.138
- THAT'S WHAT I TELL GIRLS.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.339
- I'M A BUMPY RIDE.

03:59.372 --> 04:00.373
[laughs]

04:00.407 --> 04:01.374
- ARE YOU?

04:01.408 --> 04:02.809
GOOD TO KNOW.

04:02.842 --> 04:05.245
I AM--I AM--YOU'RE
THE BEST CLIENT I'VE EVER HAD.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.514
SO THE FIRST APARTMENT
I'M BRINGING BARBARA TO

04:07.547 --> 04:09.582
IS AT 20 SUTTON PLACE,

04:09.616 --> 04:11.284
WHICH IS
AN OLD MONEY NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.485
- IT LOOKS GREAT.

04:12.519 --> 04:14.521
- IT'S A LITTLE BIT
OFF THE BEATEN PATH.

04:14.554 --> 04:16.089
THERE'S GOOD SCHOOLS NEARBY.

04:16.122 --> 04:18.425
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TRAFFIC,
SO IT'S SAFE.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.493
THERE'S A LOT, A LOT,
A LOT OF MONEY THERE

04:20.527 --> 04:22.729
AND A LOT OF CELEBRITIES
BECAUSE IT'S SO QUIET.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.164
- HI, I'M BARBARA.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:24.197 --> 04:25.165
I'M KATHERINE.

04:25.198 --> 04:26.299
HEY, RYAN.
- HI, KATHERINE.

04:43.383 --> 04:46.152
- AMAZING ONYX TILES
THAT ACTUALLY ARE SEE-THROUGH.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.287
SO IT...
- WHOA.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.622
- LIGHTS UP
FROM UNDERNEATH THE COUNTER.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.391
IT'S PRETTY COOL.
- I LOVE THE MARBLE.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.559
- THAT'S CRAZY.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.361
- THIS WOULD BE A GREAT BATHROOM
TO HAVE SEX IN.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.563
- WAIT, CAN YOU RUB YOUR FINGERS
ON THE DIMMER SWITCHES?

04:56.596 --> 04:58.198
- OOH.
- OH, OH, GOD, IT FEELS GOOD.

04:58.231 --> 04:59.232
WAIT, SHUT THE DOOR.

04:59.265 --> 05:00.600
- [laughs]

05:00.633 --> 05:02.769
- OOH, NOW YOU LIKE
THIS APARTMENT NOW, DON'T YOU?

05:02.802 --> 05:04.037
- [laughs]

05:04.037 --> 05:06.573
- WHAT I WASN'T EXPECTING
FROM MISS IDAHO,

05:06.606 --> 05:07.774
MOTHER OF TWO...

05:07.807 --> 05:09.175
YOU CAN DANCE IN HERE.

05:09.209 --> 05:12.312
IS THAT SHE'S VERY...

05:12.345 --> 05:13.813
SEXUAL.

05:13.847 --> 05:14.814
- [laughs]

05:14.848 --> 05:16.116
YOU'RE LIKE, "YEAH."

05:16.149 --> 05:17.617
- OOH, WHAT'S THIS ROOM?

05:17.650 --> 05:19.419
OH, THIS COULD BE MY ROOM,
AWESOME.

05:19.452 --> 05:20.420
- [laughs]

05:20.453 --> 05:21.755
MY MIND IS LIKE, "WHAT?"

05:21.788 --> 05:23.757
- SEXUAL TENSION IS OFTEN--
IS OFTEN GOOD.

05:23.790 --> 05:24.924
- OH, CAREFUL.
- WHOA, SORRY.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.359
- CAREFUL.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

05:26.393 --> 05:28.561
WE WERE DRINKING IN THE CAR.
- I HATE IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

05:28.595 --> 05:30.830
- I MEAN, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE--
I'D SAY IT HELPS SOMETIMES,

05:30.864 --> 05:32.332
BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE'S
SEXUALLY EXCITED,

05:32.365 --> 05:34.768
IT MEANS THEY'LL
PROBABLY PULL THE TRIGGER.

05:34.801 --> 05:38.271
HOW DOES THIS ROOM
FEEL TO YOU, LIKE, SIZE-WISE?

05:38.304 --> 05:39.639
- A LITTLE MORE ROOM
WOULD BE NICE.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.640
- IS IT BIG ENOUGH?

05:40.674 --> 05:41.975
IT'S ONLY A SINGLE VANITY.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.343
- TOO SMALL.

05:43.376 --> 05:45.078
- DO YOU LIKE THAT IT HAS
A SEPARATE DINING ROOM?

05:45.078 --> 05:47.080
THIS IS GONNA BE, LIKE, ONE
OF THE ONLY APARTMENTS WE SEE

05:47.113 --> 05:49.082
THAT'S GONNA HAVE, LIKE,
A SEPARATE DINING ROOM.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.319
AND IT DOESN'T LEAVE ME
A REAL HOME FEELING.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.088
- OKAY.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.190
BARBARA'S GONNA FACE
A FEW ROADBLOCKS

05:57.223 --> 05:58.358
AT THIS BUDGET LEVEL.

05:58.391 --> 05:59.726
- THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME
THE APARTMENT.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.061
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- SO WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.195
SHE'S FROM IDAHO,

06:02.228 --> 06:03.630
WHERE YOU CAN SPEND
A COUPLE MILLION DOLLARS

06:03.663 --> 06:04.631
AND GET A MANSION.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.399
NOW, NEW YORK, YOU KNOW,

06:06.433 --> 06:09.102
IS FAR MORE EXPENSIVE
PER SQUARE FOOT,

06:09.135 --> 06:11.037
SO IF YOU TRULY WANT MORE SPACE,

06:11.037 --> 06:12.439
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO UP
YOUR BUDGET.

06:12.472 --> 06:13.940
- OKAY.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.910
- BUT RIGHT NOW, WE'RE GONNA GO
TO THE NEXT PROPERTY OF THE DAY,

06:16.943 --> 06:18.511
RIGHT, WHICH IS BIGGER.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.680
AND IT NEEDS
A LITTLE BIT OF WORK,

06:20.714 --> 06:22.082
BUT IT'S A LOT OF SPACE.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.883
- OKAY, GREAT.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.186
- BARBARA MENTIONED TO ME
THAT SHE IS OKAY WITH REMODELING

06:26.219 --> 06:27.187
IF SHE NEEDS TO.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.188
- ALL RIGHT.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.322
- READY?
- YEP.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.391
- SO MY STRATEGY HERE
IS TO SHOW BARBARA

06:31.424 --> 06:33.059
THE BIGGEST APARTMENT
I CAN FIND IN HER BUDGET.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.095
LOOK AT THIS.
- YEAH, IT'S KIND OF NICE.

06:35.128 --> 06:37.964
- STERLING PLAZA
IS LOCATED ON 49TH STREET.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.066
IT'S A QUICK WALK
FOR HER HUSBAND TO GET TO WORK.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.402
AND BY LIVING ON 49TH STREET,

06:42.435 --> 06:44.604
YOU CAN BE WALKING DISTANCE
FROM TIMES SQUARE,

06:44.637 --> 06:45.672
FROM CENTRAL PARK.

06:45.705 --> 06:46.973
YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE CENTER
OF IT.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.408
- JOHAN, HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

06:48.441 --> 06:50.143
- THANKS FOR THE SHORT NOTICE.
- ABSOLUTELY.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.294
- DOES THIS WORK FOR YOU?

07:08.328 --> 07:10.563
- I THINK
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL APARTMENT.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.866
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.901
I THINK THE FRAMING
OF THE WINDOWS LOOKS OLD.

07:14.934 --> 07:17.303
AND I DID NOTICE
IT WOULD NEED SOME RE-GROUTING.

07:17.337 --> 07:18.638
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
WHEN THE TILES

07:18.672 --> 07:19.939
LOOK A LITTLE OUTDATED,

07:20.040 --> 07:22.042
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO MATCH.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.044
- WHEN I SAW BARBARA'S REACTION
TO THAT APARTMENT,

07:24.044 --> 07:26.146
I REALIZED
THAT HER DESIRE TO RENOVATE

07:26.179 --> 07:27.614
WAS TOTAL BULLS[bleep].

07:27.647 --> 07:30.450
- IT'S A LITTLE
JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME I THINK.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.619
- YEAH.
- THANK YOU.

07:32.652 --> 07:33.953
- MY PLEASURE.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.121
- SO NOW I GOT TO FIND SOMETHING

07:35.155 --> 07:38.058
THAT'S WITHIN THE BUDGET,
THE RIGHT SIZE,

07:38.058 --> 07:40.493
AND DOESN'T NEED
TO BE RENOVATED.

07:40.527 --> 07:43.063
IT'S LIKE--THAT'S LIKE
A TRIPLE THREAT FOR ME.

07:56.509 --> 07:58.778
- SEﾃ前R, HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.380
AT MY OPEN HOUSE
AT 50 LISPENARD,

08:00.413 --> 08:02.682
LUIS COMES UP TO ME
AND INTRODUCES HIMSELF

08:02.716 --> 08:04.784
AND ASKS ME OUT FOR DRINKS.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.821
I'M NOT SURE WHY,
BUT I'M INTRIGUED.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.255
DO YOU HAVE ANY SWEDISH VODKA?

08:09.289 --> 08:11.658
- NO, HOW CAN YOU
BE IN A PUERTO RICAN RESTAURANT

08:11.691 --> 08:13.426
AND NOT GET SOMETHING
PUERTO RICAN?

08:13.460 --> 08:15.295
- WE HAVE RUM TOO...
- RUM, DON "Q," IT'S GOOD.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.563
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
- I GUESS.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.065
- WHY NOT?
- DO AS--DO AS THE ROMANS DO.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.534
- I DON'T KNOW FREDRIK WELL,
BUT I'M HERE

08:21.568 --> 08:23.603
BECAUSE FREDRIK
HAS ALMOST SOLD OUT THE BUILDING

08:23.636 --> 08:24.838
THAT I WANTED SO BAD.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.906
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT THIS GUY'S THINKING.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.475
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT HIS STRATEGY IS.

08:28.508 --> 08:32.312
I NEED TO KNOW
HOW HE DOES THINGS.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.881
[laughing]

08:34.914 --> 08:36.649
- YOU FOR REAL?
YOU'RE DRINKING THIS?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.118
IT TASTES
A LITTLE BIT LIKE GASOLINE.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.352
- DON'T WORRY.

08:39.386 --> 08:41.121
AFTER THE SECOND ONE,
YOU WON'T EVEN FEEL IT.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.789
[laughing]

08:42.822 --> 08:44.591
- SO TELL ME,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

08:44.624 --> 08:46.059
- SO LISTEN,

08:46.092 --> 08:47.494
YOU KNOW,
I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB

08:47.527 --> 08:48.661
ON 50 LISPENARD.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.063
- WELL, IT'S NOT DONE YET.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.331
- AT LEAST, SO FAR,
WHAT I'VE SEEN.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.832
AND SO I WENT
TO THAT OPEN HOUSE.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.868
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS INCREDIBLE,
WHICH, BY THE WAY--

08:54.901 --> 08:55.935
- YOU LOOKED A LITTLE SAD.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.604
I SAW YOU ACROSS THE ROOM,
AND YOU--

08:57.637 --> 08:59.139
YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU
WERE SULKING A BIT.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.740
- YES, AND IT'S JUST--
I PUT A LOT OF--

09:00.774 --> 09:02.075
I PUT A LOT OF HEART INTO IT.

09:02.108 --> 09:04.377
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
I PITCHED A DEVELOPMENT.

09:04.411 --> 09:07.313
AND AFTER LOSING IT,
I WAS VERY UPSET.

09:07.347 --> 09:10.183
BUT I GUESS THE REASON
I WANTED TO INVITE YOU HERE

09:10.216 --> 09:14.654
IS BECAUSE THERE WAS SOMETHING
THAT YOU DID THAT I DIDN'T DO.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.022
- WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
I ADMIRE,

09:16.056 --> 09:19.726
BECAUSE NOT A LOT OF BROKERS
WOULD ASK FOR HELP.

09:19.759 --> 09:20.827
THAT'S BIG OF YOU.

09:20.860 --> 09:23.229
IN THE VERY BEGINNING
OF MY CAREER,

09:23.263 --> 09:24.731
I UNDERSTOOD
THAT NEW DEVELOPMENT

09:24.764 --> 09:25.932
IS WHERE THE BIG MONEY IS,

09:26.032 --> 09:28.802
BUT ENERGY AND PASSION
IS GONNA TAKE YOU FAR.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.136
- BUT NOT ENOUGH.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.038
- NO, YOU NEED TO--
YOU NEED TO SHOW THE NUMBERS.

09:32.038 --> 09:33.406
YOU NEED TO SHOW EXPERIENCE.
- YEAH.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.575
- SO HOW DO YOU GET YOURSELF
ON THAT SIDE OF THE BUSINESS?

09:35.608 --> 09:37.711
HOW DO YOU GET YOURSELF
IN WITH THE DEVELOPERS?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.879
AND YOU CAN'T IN THE BEGINNING.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.716
SO WHAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO
IS TO PARTNER UP WITH SOMEBODY

09:42.749 --> 09:44.484
AND LEARN FROM THE BOTTOM UP.

09:44.517 --> 09:45.652
- OKAY.

09:45.685 --> 09:48.722
- CLEARLY, LITTLE LUIS
IS A SMART COOKIE.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.624
HE RECOGNIZES GREATNESS
WHEN HE SEES IT.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.126
LUIS.
- YES.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.127
- I LIKE YOU.

09:54.160 --> 09:55.128
I LIKE YOU A LOT.

09:55.161 --> 09:58.098
I HAVE AN IDEA.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.867
I STILL HAVEN'T SOLD
THE SECOND FLOOR.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.936
MAYBE WE CAN DO A CO-LISTING.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.005
- REALLY?

10:05.038 --> 10:07.173
- THE ONLY THING IS,

10:07.207 --> 10:09.743
YOU HAVE TO DO AN OPEN HOUSE,
AND YOU'RE UNDER MY DIRECTION.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.144
YOU DO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS?

10:11.177 --> 10:12.145
- YES.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.246
- IF YOU SELL IT,

10:13.279 --> 10:14.647
I'LL GIVE YOU
HALF THE COMMISSION.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.516
IF I SELL IT,

10:16.549 --> 10:19.386
YOU GET NOTHING.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.054
ARE YOU UP FOR IT?

10:21.087 --> 10:22.055
- I'M UP FOR IT.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.356
- THIS IS EXCITING.

10:23.390 --> 10:24.891
- IT IS VERY EXCITING.

10:24.924 --> 10:28.361
I CANNOT BELIEVE FREDRIK
IS GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.596
IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.432
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
I HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.867
SO<i>SALUD.</i>
<i>- SALUD.</i>

10:33.900 --> 10:35.802
- TO NEW FRIENDS.
LET'S DRINK.

10:35.835 --> 10:36.803
- I'M A SWEDISH VIKING.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.371
I CAN DRINK A LOT.

10:38.405 --> 10:40.473
[laughter]

10:40.507 --> 10:42.609
- BOOM.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.710
- COMING UP...

10:43.743 --> 10:45.111
SINCE YOU'RE
REPRESENTING ME NOW,

10:45.145 --> 10:46.813
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.581
LUIS AND I
OBVIOUSLY HAVE DIFFERENT STYLES

10:48.615 --> 10:49.582
WHEN IT COMES TO SHOWINGS.

10:49.616 --> 10:50.917
- * BOOM, BOOM, BOOM *

10:50.950 --> 10:52.652
- OH, MY GOD.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.598
- HANGING OUT WITH LUIS
THE OTHER NIGHT WAS FUN,

11:05.632 --> 11:06.866
BUT THIS IS WORK.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.168
AND IT'S TIME
TO GET SERIOUS NOW.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.636
- WHO'D THINK
THAT AFTER ALL WE DRANK,

11:09.669 --> 11:10.637
YOU DIDN'T FORGET THAT WE

11:10.670 --> 11:11.938
ACTUALLY HAD
SOME KIND OF A DEAL.

11:11.971 --> 11:13.239
- I HAVE A BIT OF A HEADACHE
STILL.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.641
- YOU DO?
- YES.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.510
I'M GIVING LITTLE LUIS
A CHANCE TO DO AN OPEN HOUSE,

11:17.544 --> 11:18.978
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE
HE'S PREPARED.

11:19.079 --> 11:20.547
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR GIVING ME THIS.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.248
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH
IT MEANS TO ME, MAN.

11:22.282 --> 11:25.552
- NOW, THERE'S SOME RULES
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT.

11:25.585 --> 11:27.354
FIRST OF ALL,
I WANT YOU TO WEAR A TIE.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.756
- OKAY, YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO SHOW THE PUERTO RICAN HAIR?

11:29.789 --> 11:30.890
- NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.193
THE SECOND THING IS,

11:33.226 --> 11:35.195
SHOW ME LIKE I AM YOUR BUYER

11:35.228 --> 11:36.696
SO I CAN GIVE YOU
SOME DIRECTIONS.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.099
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT SINCE
YOU'RE REPRESENTING ME NOW,

11:39.099 --> 11:41.634
MY BRAND, MY COMPANY,
AND MY DEVELOPER,

11:41.668 --> 11:43.636
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

11:43.670 --> 11:44.637
- OKAY.

11:44.671 --> 11:45.705
THIS WILL BE VERY EASY.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.107
I MEAN,
I'VE DONE MULTIPLE SHOWINGS

11:47.107 --> 11:48.241
IN THIS BUILDING BEFORE.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.776
I KNOW THIS THING
LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND.

11:49.809 --> 11:51.277
- WHAT ARE THESE FLOORS,
MY FRIEND?

11:51.311 --> 11:52.345
THESE LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.814
- THESE ARE CONCRETE POLISHED
FLOORS.

11:54.848 --> 11:57.851
- OKAY, AND WHY IS CONCRETE
BETTER FOR ME AS A BUYER?

11:57.884 --> 11:59.119
- IT TELLS YOU THAT THEY

11:59.119 --> 12:01.554
HAVE ACTUALLY PUT
SO MUCH MORE WORK INTO IT.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.690
- WHAT ABOUT THIS THEN?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.392
- EXPOSED BRICK,
IT'S A LOT OF BRICK.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.294
IN FACT, I WAS TOLD--
- OOH, ALMOST TOO MUCH, NO?

12:08.328 --> 12:09.829
- NO, NO,
IT'S COMPLETELY PERFECT.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.631
IN FACT,
IT'S ACTUALLY REAL BRICK.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.066
- REAL BRICK--
THERE'S FAKE BRICK?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.901
- WELL, YOU CAN TEST
IF IT'S ACTUALLY REAL

12:14.934 --> 12:16.503
IF YOU PUT YOUR TONGUE IN IT
AND IT STICKS.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.338
- WHAT?

12:18.371 --> 12:20.607
- IF YOU PUT YOUR TONGUE IN IT
AND IT STICKS, IT'S REAL BRICK.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.443
- DO YOU--IS THAT SOMETHING
YOU SHOW BUYERS?

12:27.313 --> 12:28.314
- IT ACTUALLY STICKS.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.349
[laughter]

12:29.382 --> 12:30.350
YES.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.519
- OH, NO.

12:32.552 --> 12:33.687
YOU THINK THIS HELPS SELL?

12:33.720 --> 12:35.488
- YOU DO ACTUALLY HAVE SOME FUN
IN THE MIDDLE--

12:35.522 --> 12:37.090
- NO TONGUES.
- NO TONGUES, OKAY.

12:37.123 --> 12:39.826
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD AGREE
WITH MY STYLE OF SHOWING,

12:39.859 --> 12:40.860
BUT IT WORKS.

12:40.894 --> 12:41.861
EVERYONE HAD A GREAT TIME

12:41.895 --> 12:43.296
WHEN I WAS SHOWING THIS UNIT
TO THEM.

12:43.329 --> 12:45.365
AND THAT'S NOT
WHERE I LOST THEM.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.000
SO WE JUST HAVE TO FIND
A HAPPY MEDIUM.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.870
SO THIS IS THE DOUBLE SHOWER,
GOOD FOR THREESOMES.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.572
- GOOD FOR WHAT?
- FOR THREESOMES.

12:52.605 --> 12:53.773
- YOU DO NOT SAY THAT.
- OR--

12:55.208 --> 12:56.743
[laughter]

12:56.776 --> 12:57.944
- THIS IS A HUGE SHOWER.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.245
DON'T SAY "FOR THREESOMES."

12:59.279 --> 13:00.547
- FOURSOMES?
- DON'T EVEN GO--

13:00.580 --> 13:03.049
NO, DEFINITELY NOT.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.418
- LOOK, A BALCONY.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.886
- NO.
- YEP.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.054
- NO.
- LOOK AT THIS.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.056
- LUIS AND I
OBVIOUSLY HAVE DIFFERENT STYLES

13:10.056 --> 13:11.191
WHEN IT COMES TO SHOWINGS.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.492
- YOU COME HERE,
DANCE SOME SALSA.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.760
* BOOM, BOOM, BOOM *

13:13.793 --> 13:16.096
- AND IT'S CLEAR TO ME
WHO HAS THE BETTER ONE:

13:16.129 --> 13:17.163
ME.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.164
OH, MY GOD.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.766
THESE YOUNG BROKERS ALWAYS THINK

13:19.799 --> 13:21.301
THAT GIMMICKS
WILL SELL APARTMENTS,

13:21.334 --> 13:22.302
BUT IT WON'T.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.938
FACTS AND DETAILS,

13:24.971 --> 13:26.373
THAT'S WHAT SELLS.

13:26.406 --> 13:29.509
YOU WANT TO PROVE TO THEM
ACTUALLY WITH YOUR OWN FEET

13:29.542 --> 13:31.878
THAT YOU COULD FIT
A QUEEN BED HERE.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.713
IT HAS AN EXTRA-LONG SETBACK.

13:33.747 --> 13:35.515
IN TRIBECA, SOHO,
YOU'RE VERY CLOSE,

13:35.548 --> 13:36.916
BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY FAR AWAY.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.519
- I--I KNOW I MAY NOT HAVE
AS MUCH EXPERIENCE AS FREDRIK,

13:39.552 --> 13:40.820
BUT THIS GUY'S ACTING LIKE THIS

13:40.854 --> 13:42.455
IS MY FIRST LISTING
APPOINTMENT EVER

13:42.489 --> 13:44.090
COME ON, GIVE ME
A LITTLE CREDIT AT LEAST.

13:44.124 --> 13:46.760
- YOU KNOW WHAT IT NEEDS, TOO,
IS MAYBE SOME FLOWERS.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.461
- OKAY, RED FLOWERS, COOL.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.663
- WHEN IS THE BEST TIME
TO SHOW THIS UNIT?

13:50.697 --> 13:51.765
- DEPENDING ON THE SEASON.

13:51.798 --> 13:55.368
- NO, BUT NOW, THIS SEASON.
- NOW?

13:55.402 --> 13:58.238
- FIND OUT, AND MAKE SURE
YOU TIME THE OPEN HOUSE.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.539
- OKAY.
- I WANT DIRECT SUNLIGHT HERE.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.042
- WHAT IF THE OPEN HOUSE
ACTUALLY TAKES PLACE AT NIGHT?

14:02.075 --> 14:04.244
- NO, THAT'S A BAD IDEA.
- WHAT IF IT'S A GOOD EVENT?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.046
- THIS UNIT IS ABOUT LIGHT.
IT'S ABOUT DRAMA.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.080
THIS IS A SECOND FLOOR UNIT.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.515
YOU WANT TO GET AWAY
FROM EVERYTHING

14:08.548 --> 14:11.084
THAT'S DARK AND COLD
AND EMPTY AND DUSTY,

14:11.117 --> 14:13.053
AND YOU WANT TO SHOW--

14:13.053 --> 14:14.487
NOT NIGHT, TRUST ME.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.056
- ALL RIGHT.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.525
- LUIS IS YOUNG, YES,
BUT I DO BELIEVE IN HIM.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.660
HE JUST NEEDS TO APPROACH
THIS OPEN HOUSE

14:20.694 --> 14:22.429
AS PROFESSIONALLY AS POSSIBLE.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.298
THE DAYS OF LICKING BRICKS
IS DEFINITELY OVER.

14:25.331 --> 14:26.866
I WOULD, LIKE, TONE IT
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.068
I WOULD STICK TO THE FACTS,

14:28.101 --> 14:30.203
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LOWER,
HELD-BACK ENERGY,

14:30.236 --> 14:31.304
AND BE SMART.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.173
MAKE ME PROUD.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.307
I GOT TO GO.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.575
- ALL RIGHT.

14:46.252 --> 14:47.654
- OLIVIA, CAN YOU COME HERE,
PLEASE?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.522
I NEED HELP WITH SOMETHING.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.824
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU
NEED ME TO DO?

14:50.857 --> 14:53.093
- CAN YOU SHOW ME
HOW TO WORK THIS THING, PLEASE?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.094
- A NERF GUN?

14:54.127 --> 14:55.195
- YES.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.196
- LET'S PUT THE TOYS AWAY.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.397
LET'S GET TO WORK.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.732
- ARE THESE YOUR SUNGLASSES?

14:58.765 --> 15:00.467
- MM-HMM.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.035
NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.770
- YOU DON'T LIKE THESE?
- NOT ON YOU.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.338
- SHOULD I BRING THIS
TO AN APPOINTMENT?

15:05.372 --> 15:06.606
[phone ringing]

15:06.639 --> 15:07.774
WHO'S THAT?

15:07.807 --> 15:10.043
- YOU SHOULD PROBABLY ANSWER IT.
- THIS IS RYAN.

15:12.479 --> 15:13.580
- HEY, BARB.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.781
IN THE PAST WEEK,

15:14.814 --> 15:16.483
I'VE SHOWN BARBARA
SOME OTHER PROPERTIES.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.352
- THIS IS A ROMANTIC APARTMENT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

15:19.386 --> 15:21.588
- MM-HMM, YOU LIKE IT?

15:25.125 --> 15:26.960
DID YOU JUST TOUCH MY--
DID YOU JUST TOUCH MY--

15:27.060 --> 15:28.628
OKAY, I GOT IT.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.764
BUT ALL WE'VE
REALLY MANAGED TO ACCOMPLISH

15:30.797 --> 15:32.632
IS A LOT OF FLIRTING.

15:32.665 --> 15:33.667
HOW ARE YOU?

15:35.835 --> 15:37.370
- YOU HAVE GREAT NEWS.

15:44.778 --> 15:45.779
- OH, YEAH?

15:49.749 --> 15:51.384
- WOW.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.585
AWESOME, PERFECT.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.620
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

16:04.397 --> 16:07.233
- I--I AM AWARE.

16:07.267 --> 16:08.802
ALL RIGHT,
SO I'M GONNA TRY TO GET ACCESS

16:08.835 --> 16:11.371
TO SOMETHING,
AND THEN I WILL LET YOU KNOW.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.372
BUT THIS IS GREAT.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.573
THANK YOUR HUSBAND FOR ME.

16:16.910 --> 16:17.911
- OKAY, SEE YOU, BARBARA.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.380
- THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.048
- SHE'S PROBABLY GONNA--

16:22.048 --> 16:24.651
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE
TO DO TO GET THIS DEAL DONE.

16:24.684 --> 16:25.819
pop!

16:25.852 --> 16:27.554
- [laughs]

16:32.692 --> 16:34.060
[cell phone ringing]

16:34.060 --> 16:35.061
- FREDRIK SPEAKING.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.264
- SO THIS IS THE SECOND FLOOR.

16:38.298 --> 16:40.066
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?
- YEAH, IT'S GORGEOUS.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.601
- JULIE HAS A FOREIGN CLIENT

16:41.634 --> 16:44.170
LOOKING FOR AN INVESTMENT
IN NEW YORK BELOW $3 MILLION.

16:44.204 --> 16:45.672
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:49.109 --> 16:51.211
- 50 LISPENARD, SECOND FLOOR.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.553
- I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO JASMIT.

17:00.587 --> 17:04.591
HE WON'T TAKE ANYTHING LESS
THAN $2,975,000

17:04.624 --> 17:05.692
FOR THE SECOND FLOOR.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.394
ALL THE OTHER ONES
SOLD CLOSE TO ASK.

17:07.427 --> 17:08.395
HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT ME

17:08.428 --> 17:09.696
TO PRESENT ANYTHING
LESS THAN THAT.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.365
$2.975 MILLION,
AND THAT'S REALLY IT.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.700
IF JULIE WANTS THIS,

17:13.733 --> 17:15.035
SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO GET
HER BUYER UP.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.269
IT'S OUR LAST UNIT.

17:16.302 --> 17:18.938
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT, LOVE.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.712
- IT DOES CARRY SOME WEIGHT,

17:25.745 --> 17:27.781
BUT WE HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE
THIS COMING SUNDAY.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.083
AND, I MEAN, WE'RE STILL TAKING
OFFERS FROM OTHER PEOPLE.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.053
- $2.975 MILLION.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.256
- BUT ACT QUICKLY BEFORE SUNDAY.

17:42.862 --> 17:44.531
[indistinct chatter]

17:44.564 --> 17:45.899
- SO LISTEN.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.634
AT THIS POINT,
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING THAT--

17:47.667 --> 17:50.637
SOMETHING
THAT MAKES A STATEMENT.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.339
FREDRIK HAS GIVEN ME THE CHANCE

17:52.372 --> 17:54.641
TO DO AN OPEN HOUSE
FOR 50 LISPENARD.

17:54.674 --> 17:57.110
IT'S THIS WEEKEND,
AND I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT

17:57.143 --> 17:58.611
EXACTLY WHAT
I'M DOING WITH IT YET.

17:58.645 --> 18:01.614
THIS PARTICULAR STREET
IS A HISTORIC DISTRICT,

18:01.648 --> 18:05.051
SO I WANT SOMETHING THAT--
THAT BRINGS PEOPLE BACK IN TIME.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.020
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE
FOR ME TO SELL THIS

18:07.053 --> 18:08.922
FASTER THAN FREDRIK.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.523
AND I HAVE LOT TO PROVE HERE.

18:10.557 --> 18:13.193
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, LOOK
AT THE WAY THIS GUY'S DRESSED.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.228
IT ALMOST MAKES YOU FEEL
LIKE YOU'RE BACK IN TIME.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.329
YOU KNOW, LOOK AT THE LAMPS.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.598
- THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START.

18:18.631 --> 18:21.501
- 'CAUSE THIS FEELS VERY--
THIS IS, LIKE--

18:21.534 --> 18:23.236
THIS FEELS LIKE 1930s.

18:23.269 --> 18:24.471
WHAT YEAR IS THIS?

18:24.504 --> 18:26.139
LIKE, WHAT'S THE AMBIENCE
THAT YOU ARE...

18:26.172 --> 18:27.540
- KIND OF TIP OF THE RAZOR,

18:27.574 --> 18:29.376
AND IT'S LIKE PROHIBITION
COMING UP AND EVERYTHING,

18:29.409 --> 18:31.277
BOOTLEGGERS, YOU KNOW,
THE WHOLE SMUGGLING WHISKEY.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.781
- OH, PROHIBITION, GENIUS,
PROHIBITION, THANKS.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.383
SPEAKEASY.
- YEP.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.184
- WOW, MAN.
THIS IS IT.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.053
THIS IS THE INSPIRATION
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

18:40.053 --> 18:42.255
I DON'T THINK
IT HAS EVER BEEN DONE.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.590
THAT'S EXACTLY IT.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.159
I'M NOT GONNA ASK
ALL THE BROKERS TO DRESS UP,

18:46.192 --> 18:48.061
BUT IF THEY COME IN

18:48.061 --> 18:50.864
AND THEY SEE THIS PLACE
TRANSFORMED BACK IN TIME,

18:50.897 --> 18:53.266
THEY WILL APPRECIATE
THE HISTORY AND THE GLAMOUR

18:53.299 --> 18:54.300
OF 50 LISPENARD.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.368
EVERYTHING TO THE TEE

18:55.402 --> 18:58.271
HAS TO BE AUTHENTIC
TO THAT TIME,

18:58.304 --> 18:59.873
CHARACTERS, DRINKS.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.409
WE NEED TO GET PROPS--
ALSO THE FURNITURE.

19:02.442 --> 19:05.211
AND THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE, LIKE,
SOME MUSIC MAYBE.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.813
WHAT'S THAT THING--
THE ACCORDION.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.416
I KNOW FREDRIK
LIKE THINGS MORE SIMPLE,

19:09.449 --> 19:12.786
BUT HE HAS ALREADY GIVEN ME
THE CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING,

19:12.819 --> 19:14.654
AND I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING
MY WAY.

19:14.688 --> 19:17.457
AND FREDRIK
WILL SEE THAT MY STYLE WORKS.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.260
- YOU SHOULD GET
SOME FOG MACHINES.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.728
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
F[bleep] MACHINES?

19:21.761 --> 19:24.864
- FOG MACHINES, YOU KNOW,
THEY JUST CREATE FOG,

19:24.898 --> 19:27.600
YOU KNOW, AND BRING PEOPLE
BACK INTO TIME.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.235
- I THOUGHT
HE SAID F[bleep] MACHINES.

19:29.269 --> 19:32.272
[laughter]

19:33.406 --> 19:34.574
THAT'S TRUE.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.575
- COMING UP...

19:35.608 --> 19:36.743
- I LIKE IT.
- YEAH?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.278
- AND I LOVED YOUR TIE TODAY,
BY THE WAY.

19:38.311 --> 19:40.947
I THINK YOU SHOULD BRING FOUR
NEXT TIME YOU SHOW ME THIS ROOM.

19:41.047 --> 19:44.250
- IT SEEMS LIKE SHE
WANTS TO MRS. ROBINSON ME.

19:56.896 --> 19:57.864
- READY?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.165
NOW THAT SHE'S UPPED HER BUDGET,

19:59.199 --> 20:00.567
THE NEXT THING
I'M SHOWING BARBARA

20:00.600 --> 20:01.668
ISN'T AN APARTMENT.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.103
IT'S A TOWN HOUSE

20:03.136 --> 20:04.904
LOCATED ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE.

20:04.938 --> 20:06.740
- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN I UPGRADE?

20:06.773 --> 20:08.541
- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU UPGRADE.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.210
- OKAY.
- YOU EXCITED?

20:10.243 --> 20:11.211
- I'M EXCITED.

20:11.244 --> 20:12.479
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.115
- THIS HOUSE IS LOCATED ON 62ND
BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD

20:15.148 --> 20:18.318
IN BASICALLY A TOWN HOUSE
NEIGHBORHOOD

20:18.351 --> 20:19.552
OF THE UPPER EAST SIDE.

20:19.586 --> 20:23.590
AND THE UPPER EAST SIDE
IS CLASSIC MANHATTAN.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.225
- HI.
- HOW ARE YOU?

20:25.258 --> 20:27.660
- I'M BARBARA.
- PEGGY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.661
- HELLO.
- RYAN?

20:28.695 --> 20:30.196
- YEAH.
- NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.010
- SO THIS IS
A NICE, HUGE BREAKFAST BAR.

20:44.044 --> 20:45.578
I LIKE THESE CHAIRS TOO.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.113
- YOU DO A LOT IN CHAIRS.

20:47.147 --> 20:49.783
- YES, YOU DO A LOT IN CHAIRS,

20:49.816 --> 20:51.718
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.120
- ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY SPIN.
- WHAT?

20:54.154 --> 20:56.122
UGH, HERE SHE GOES AGAIN.

20:56.156 --> 20:57.357
- OKAY.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.492
SO THIS
IS THE MASTER BEDROOM FLOOR.

20:59.526 --> 21:02.629
THE ENTIRE FLOOR
IS YOURS, OBVIOUSLY.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.364
- I LIKE THIS ROOM.
- I THINK IT'S PERFECT.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.598
I THINK IT'S AIRY.

21:05.632 --> 21:06.966
IT'S WINDOWY.

21:07.067 --> 21:08.168
IT LOOKS VERY BIG.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.869
I LIKE IT.
- YEAH?

21:09.903 --> 21:11.404
- AND I LOVED YOUR TIE TODAY,
BY THE WAY.

21:11.438 --> 21:15.975
I THINK YOU SHOULD BRING FOUR
NEXT TIME YOU SHOW ME THIS ROOM.

21:16.076 --> 21:17.077
- OKAY.

21:17.110 --> 21:18.611
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT OKAY.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.780
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU
SAW YOURSELF WITH A MOUSTACHE?

21:20.814 --> 21:24.184
- MOUSTACHE?

21:24.217 --> 21:26.119
OH.

21:26.152 --> 21:27.921
- SO LET'S GO
THROUGH THE BATHROOM.

21:27.954 --> 21:30.190
- I'M MOST NERVOUS THAT PEGGY'S
JUST GONNA WALK OUT.

21:30.223 --> 21:31.825
SHE'S NICE ENOUGH
TO SHOW THIS HOUSE

21:31.858 --> 21:33.326
TO MY CLIENT AND I.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.261
I DON'T WANT HER TO THINK
THAT I'M WASTING HER TIME

21:35.295 --> 21:36.930
BY BRINGING IN THIS WOMAN
WHO, YOU KNOW,

21:36.963 --> 21:38.631
ONLY COMMENTS ON SEX.

21:38.665 --> 21:39.899
- SO THIS IS THE SECOND BEDROOM.

21:39.933 --> 21:41.334
- I LIKE IT.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.436
- YEAH.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT SOUND?

21:43.470 --> 21:45.872
BECAUSE MY SON
LIKES TO BOUNCE HIS BASKETBALL.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.741
- THERE IS GREAT INSULATION
WITHIN THE WALLS,

21:47.774 --> 21:50.443
SO DON'T SEE NOISE
BEING AN ISSUE.

21:50.477 --> 21:55.448
- IF I BROUGHT RYAN ALONG
AND WE WERE BOUNCING BALLS

21:55.482 --> 21:58.118
IN THE MASTER SUITE,

21:58.151 --> 22:01.688
WOULD YOU MIND STAYING UP HERE
TO SEE IF YOU CAN HEAR ANYTHING?

22:01.721 --> 22:04.157
- UM...

22:04.190 --> 22:05.825
- IN MY BUSINESS,

22:05.859 --> 22:08.261
FLIRTING IS THE MOST VALUABLE
ASSET THAT I HAVE.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.196
- SO THIS ROOM IS KIND OF OPEN.

22:10.230 --> 22:13.400
- BUT SOMETIMES IT BACKFIRES,

22:13.433 --> 22:17.303
AND NOW IT'S GETTING
VERY, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

22:17.337 --> 22:18.805
OKAY, SO LET'S GO.
- OKAY.

22:18.838 --> 22:19.973
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

22:20.073 --> 22:22.442
ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT, THAT WAS AWESOME.

22:22.475 --> 22:24.077
I LIKE IT.
- OKAY.

22:24.077 --> 22:25.779
YOU LIKE IT ENOUGH
TO MAYBE PUT IN AN OFFER?

22:25.812 --> 22:27.080
YOU WANT TO CALL YOUR HUSBAND?

22:27.113 --> 22:28.481
- I THINK
WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK,

22:28.515 --> 22:30.583
BUT I'D JUST LIKE TO SPEND
A FEW MORE DAYS WITH YOU.

22:30.617 --> 22:33.386
- LOOKING AT HOMES?
- YEAH.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.588
- OKAY, SO I CAN PUT SOME--
I'LL PUT SOME THINGS TOGETHER.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.257
AND WE'LL MEET,
AND WE'LL GO THROUGH THEM.

22:37.290 --> 22:38.425
- GREAT.
- ALL RIGHT.

22:38.458 --> 22:39.893
- AND THEN YOU KNOW
WHERE I'M STAYING.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.194
- I DO KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE STAYING.

22:41.227 --> 22:43.096
- IN CASE YOU HAVE
ANY LATE NIGHT QUESTIONS,

22:43.129 --> 22:45.298
I'M AVAILABLE.

22:45.331 --> 22:47.767
- IT SEEMS LIKE SHE, YOU KNOW,
JUST WANTS TO HANG OUT.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.002
SHE WANTS TO FLIRT.

22:49.102 --> 22:50.103
AFTER YOU.

22:50.136 --> 22:53.506
SHE WANTS TO TRY
TO MRS. ROBINSON ME.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.874
YOU OKAY?
- I'M IN.

22:54.908 --> 22:56.409
- ALL RIGHT.

22:56.443 --> 22:57.510
OH, MAN.

23:02.515 --> 23:05.452
[keyboard clicking]

23:08.755 --> 23:10.757
- OH, MY GOD, SO MANY EMAILS.

23:12.292 --> 23:13.727
[muttering indistinctly]

23:13.760 --> 23:15.962
[gasps]

23:16.062 --> 23:18.064
OH.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.599
CANDICE.

23:19.632 --> 23:20.734
- WHAT HAPPENED?

23:20.767 --> 23:22.836
- JULIE--
JULIE JUST SENT ME THE EMAIL.

23:27.307 --> 23:30.677
- ALL CASH, NO CONTINGENCIES,
$2,975,000

23:30.710 --> 23:32.078
FOR THE LAST UNIT
OF 50 LISPENARD.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.747
- THE WHOLE BUILDING DONE?
- YEAH.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.749
- OH, MY GOD, I'M SOLD-OUT.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.784
- HIGH FIVE.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.185
- THIS IS AMAZING.

23:39.219 --> 23:40.820
SOLD OUT!

23:40.854 --> 23:41.988
- [laughing]

23:42.088 --> 23:43.723
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT IS THE BEST FEELING.

23:43.757 --> 23:45.091
- ALL DONE.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.960
- LET'S GET THAT CONTRACT
DRAWN UP IMMEDIATELY.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.162
HOWEVER, AS GOOD AS I FEEL,

23:49.195 --> 23:52.632
CONTRACTS ARE NEVER A DONE DEAL
UNTIL THEY'RE DULY EXECUTED.

23:52.665 --> 23:54.567
- GOOD STUFF.

23:54.601 --> 23:57.137
- SO I THINK
I'LL STILL GIVE LUIS A CHANCE

23:57.170 --> 23:58.905
TO DO THE OPEN HOUSE.

23:58.938 --> 24:02.308
I WANT HIM TO BE MOTIVATED,
AND I AM STILL TESTING HIM.

24:02.342 --> 24:04.244
I WANT TO SEE
IF HE'S REALLY SOMEBODY

24:04.277 --> 24:06.146
I COULD BE WORKING WITH
ON FUTURE LISTINGS.

24:06.179 --> 24:07.814
ON THAT NOTE...

24:07.847 --> 24:09.049
[cell phone beeps]

24:09.082 --> 24:12.686
WHO IS THE BEST BROKER
IN ALL OF NEW YORK CITY?

24:15.455 --> 24:16.723
- [laughing]

24:18.058 --> 24:21.061
[both laughing]

24:23.396 --> 24:24.931
- I TAUGHT HER WELL.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.599
WHOO.

24:33.640 --> 24:35.809
- I'VE WORKED REALLY HARD
FOR BARBARA.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.077
AND IF HER REAL INTENTIONS

24:37.110 --> 24:38.945
ARE TO PURCHASE AN APARTMENT
FROM ME, THEN GREAT.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.080
- HEY.
- HI.

24:40.113 --> 24:41.281
- HOW ARE YOU?
- IT'S BEEN SO LONG.

24:41.314 --> 24:42.349
- GOOD.
- I KNOW.

24:42.382 --> 24:43.383
- OH.
- CUTE PLACE.

24:43.416 --> 24:44.384
- YEAH.

24:44.417 --> 24:45.485

TRY TO TAKE MY PANTS OFF,

24:53.293 --> 24:56.096

TO BE MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

25:29.195 --> 25:31.531

ABOUT REAL ESTATE.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.700

33:05.719 --> 33:11.191
* *

33:11.224 --> 33:12.759
- WHY IS IT SO SMOKY IN HERE?

33:12.792 --> 33:13.927
THE POINT OF AN OPEN HOUSE

33:13.960 --> 33:15.628
IS FOR PEOPLE
TO SEE THE APARTMENT.

33:15.662 --> 33:18.064
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN HERE?

33:18.064 --> 33:20.266
ARE THEY PLAYING POKER
OR SELLING APARTMENTS?

33:20.300 --> 33:22.802
[laughter]

33:22.836 --> 33:25.505
OH, MY GOD,
I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS.

33:25.538 --> 33:28.108
[sighs]

33:28.141 --> 33:30.176
IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT LUIS

33:30.210 --> 33:32.178
DIDN'T REALLY LISTEN TO ME
AT THE PRIVATE SHOWING.

33:32.212 --> 33:33.747
- FREDRIK, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- HOW ARE YOU?

33:33.780 --> 33:34.948
THERE'S SO MUCH SMOKE IN HERE.

33:34.981 --> 33:38.518
I TOLD HIM, "DO THE OPEN HOUSE
AT DAY IN LIGHT

33:38.551 --> 33:39.719
AND TONE IT DOWN."

33:39.753 --> 33:42.188
HE OBVIOUSLY TOOK IT
THE OTHER DIRECTION,

33:42.222 --> 33:43.423
CIRCUS AT NIGHT.

33:43.456 --> 33:45.091
I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE CLOWN
TO COME OUT.

33:45.091 --> 33:47.260
- IT'S 1930s
SPEAKEASY PROHIBITION.

33:47.293 --> 33:48.995
- WHY DID YOU DO IT
AT NIGHTTIME?

33:49.095 --> 33:50.964
- THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO KNOW AND FIND OUT

33:50.997 --> 33:51.998
IF THINGS WORK OR NOT.

33:52.098 --> 33:53.466
- OKAY.
- AND I HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE.

33:53.500 --> 33:55.869
- AND HOW IS THIS
SELLING THE APARTMENT?

33:55.902 --> 33:57.270
- LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO SOME REAL BUYERS.

33:57.303 --> 33:58.605
COME ON.

33:58.638 --> 34:00.540
FREDRIK DOESN'T SEEM HAPPY.

34:00.573 --> 34:02.175
I CAN'T SAY
I'M SURPRISED BY THAT.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.777
WHAT CAN YOU DO?

34:03.810 --> 34:06.179
BUT ONCE HE HEARS
ABOUT THIS OFFER,

34:06.212 --> 34:07.514
HE'S GOING TO BE
IN A BETTER MOOD.

34:07.547 --> 34:08.948
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO FREDRIK.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.483
- I THINK WE'VE MET
ONCE OR TWICE.

34:10.517 --> 34:11.851
- AND THIS IS HIS CLIENT.

34:11.885 --> 34:13.253
- JOSH.
- HI, JOSH, NICE TO MEET YOU.

34:13.286 --> 34:15.488
SO I HEAR THERE'S SOME INTEREST
IN THE APARTMENT.

34:15.522 --> 34:16.823
- YEAH,
THIS IS A GREAT PLACE.

34:16.856 --> 34:19.159
- SO HOW MUCH INTEREST?
- THERE WAS AN OFFER THAT YOU...

34:19.192 --> 34:20.794
- OH, THERE'S AN OFFER?
- YES.

34:20.827 --> 34:22.062
- YEAH.
- WHAT IS THE OFFER?

34:22.062 --> 34:25.065
- $2 1/2 MILLION CASH.

34:25.065 --> 34:28.168
- $2 1/2 MILLION?

34:28.201 --> 34:29.869
BUT THE ASKING
IS $2.995 MILLION.

34:29.903 --> 34:31.404
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.

34:31.438 --> 34:35.475
- MAYBE IT WAS $2 1/2 MILLION
IN 1930.

34:35.508 --> 34:37.944
AND, YOU KNOW, THE PROBLEM
IS THAT ALL THE OTHER APARTMENTS

34:37.977 --> 34:39.846
SOLD BETWEEN $2.9 MILLION
AND $3 MILLION.

34:39.879 --> 34:41.614
- BUT THIS ONE--
- IT'S JUST A LITTLE STRANGE.

34:41.648 --> 34:43.550
- BUT THIS ONE, FOR SOME REASON,
CONTINUES TO SIT.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.318
- IT'S NOT GONNA SIT
FOR VERY LONG.

34:45.352 --> 34:47.721
- WE'RE GONNA FIND THAT OUT.

34:47.754 --> 34:49.756
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY FREDRIK IS ACTING THIS WAY.

34:49.789 --> 34:50.824
THIS GUY'S MAKING AN OFFER,

34:50.857 --> 34:52.525
AND THERE IS NO REASON
TO INSULT IT.

34:52.559 --> 34:54.761
- THE MARKET PRICE
IS WHAT THE MARKET PAYS.

34:54.794 --> 34:56.629
AND THE MARKET IS WILLING TO PAY
$2 1/2 MILLION

34:56.663 --> 34:59.099
AND NOT A PENNY MORE.

34:59.099 --> 35:00.934
- EVEN THOUGH
I HAVE A CONTRACT OUT,

35:01.034 --> 35:02.669
I WOULD TAKE A GOOD OFFER
SERIOUSLY

35:02.702 --> 35:04.871
IN CASE THE CURRENT CONTRACT
FALLS THROUGH,

35:04.904 --> 35:06.906
BUT THIS IS JUST INSULTING.

35:06.940 --> 35:09.275
A BROKER LIKE THAT
WITH THAT KIND OF ATTITUDE,

35:09.309 --> 35:11.277
HE IS NEVER EVER GONNA COME
TO FULL ASK.

35:11.311 --> 35:13.079
- THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
THIS F[bleep] APARTMENT

35:13.113 --> 35:15.048
STILL SITS FOR SOME REASON.

35:15.048 --> 35:16.416
SO THE OFFER STANDS
AT $ 2 1/2 MILLION.

35:16.449 --> 35:18.118
- DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL YOU
ON MONDAY MORNING

35:18.151 --> 35:19.652
AND TELL YOU IT'S SOLD?

35:19.686 --> 35:21.588
- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO,
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

35:21.621 --> 35:23.790
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY
WHEN I SELL IT ON MONDAY?

35:23.823 --> 35:24.958
- I'M GONNA SAY, "MY MISTAKE,"

35:25.058 --> 35:26.459
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE SOLD
MONDAY.

35:31.364 --> 35:32.499
- WAIT, WHAT?

35:32.532 --> 35:35.135
- $2.975 MILLION, ALL CASH.

35:35.168 --> 35:36.803
- WHY ARE WE
HAVING A CONVERSATION THEN?

35:36.836 --> 35:39.472
- IT'S--WHOA.

35:39.506 --> 35:40.740
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

35:40.774 --> 35:42.475
HE SENT A CONTRACT OUT?

35:42.509 --> 35:43.610
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

35:45.879 --> 35:47.781
- LUIS DIDN'T DO ONE THING
I TOLD HIM TO DO.

35:47.814 --> 35:49.182
THIS IS MY PROPERTY,

35:49.215 --> 35:51.718
AND THINGS SHOULD BE DONE
TO MY STANDARDS.

35:51.751 --> 35:52.719
- I'M OUT OF HERE.

35:52.752 --> 35:55.588
- IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

36:04.931 --> 36:06.266
- HI.

36:06.299 --> 36:09.202
CAN I--THINK I'M GONNA JUST DO
A STELLA, PLEASE.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.203
- STELLA?

36:10.236 --> 36:11.571
- IT ONLY TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR

36:11.604 --> 36:13.173
TO HEAR BACK FROM PEGGY.

36:13.206 --> 36:15.608
- HI, RYAN.
- HEY.

36:15.642 --> 36:17.043
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

36:17.043 --> 36:18.678
DID YOU WANT ANYTHING?

36:18.712 --> 36:20.714
- NO, I'LL JUST HAVE
A GLASS OF WATER.

36:20.747 --> 36:22.048
- GLASS OF WATER?
- YEAH.

36:22.048 --> 36:23.483
- THANK YOU.

36:23.516 --> 36:24.584
OKAY.

36:24.617 --> 36:27.854
- SO WHY DON'T WE

36:27.887 --> 36:30.056
PLAY A GAME?

36:30.056 --> 36:31.358
- WHAT KIND OF GAME?

36:31.391 --> 36:36.763
- SO YOU ARE GONNA WRITE
THE BEST PRICE YOU CAN GIVE ME

36:36.796 --> 36:38.298
ON THIS COCKTAIL NAPKIN.

36:38.331 --> 36:40.700
I'M GONNA WRITE THE BEST PRICE
I CAN GIVE YOU,

36:40.734 --> 36:42.969
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HOLD 'EM
ON OUR FOREHEAD.

36:43.069 --> 36:46.406
AND WE ARE GOING TO PRAY
THAT THEY ARE THE SAME NUMBER.

36:46.439 --> 36:48.208
- WE'RE REALLY GONNA HOLD 'EM
ON OUR FOREHEAD?

36:48.241 --> 36:49.209
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

36:49.242 --> 36:50.510
- YOU NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE?

36:50.543 --> 36:52.345
HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED, LIKE,
DRINKING GAMES BEFORE?

36:52.379 --> 36:53.847
- NO, BUT THIS
ISN'T REALLY HOW I NEGOTIATE.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.248
- YOU CAN'T TAKE YOURSELF
SO SERIOUSLY.

36:55.281 --> 36:57.484
- OKAY.

36:57.517 --> 36:58.785
- THIS MAY SEEM
LIKE A SILLY GAME,

36:58.818 --> 37:00.020
BUT THERE'S A REASON FOR IT.

37:00.020 --> 37:01.721
DO YOU HAVE A--
DO YOU HAVE A SHARPIE?

37:01.755 --> 37:02.756
- SHARPIE?

37:02.789 --> 37:04.224
- SOMETIMES IN A NEGOTIATION,

37:04.257 --> 37:06.026
IF YOU SAY YOUR NUMBER FIRST,

37:06.026 --> 37:08.228
YOU NEVER KNOW
IF THE OTHER SIDE

37:08.261 --> 37:11.031
WILL CHANGE THEIR NUMBER
SUDDENLY BASED ON YOUR OFFER.

37:11.064 --> 37:12.699
- SO DON'T LOOK.

37:12.732 --> 37:14.467
- BY GETTING PEGGY
TO WRITE HER COUNTER DOWN,

37:14.501 --> 37:17.404
I KNOW SHE CAN'T ADJUST HERS
WHEN SHE HEARS MINE.

37:17.437 --> 37:19.372
- OKAY.
- READY?

37:19.406 --> 37:25.078
ONE, TWO, THREE.

37:25.111 --> 37:26.546
I CAN'T SEE IT.

37:26.579 --> 37:29.382
"6.7," ARE YOU CRAZY?

37:29.416 --> 37:31.117
YOU DIDN'T EVEN COME DOWN
THAT MUCH.

37:31.151 --> 37:32.552
- I'M--YOU DIDN'T COME UP MUCH.

37:32.585 --> 37:33.787
- I CAME UP $250,000.

37:33.820 --> 37:35.722
- I CAME UP--
- OH, YOU CAME DOWN $300,000.

37:35.755 --> 37:37.057
- I WENT DOWN MORE
THAN YOU CAME UP.

37:37.090 --> 37:38.925
- BUT STILL, IT'S NOT--

37:38.958 --> 37:40.360
I--LIKE I TOLD YOU,
I'M COMING UP--

37:40.393 --> 37:42.262
EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR
WITH HER NOW IS--

37:42.295 --> 37:43.963
LIKE, IT'S SO PAINFUL.
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.

37:44.064 --> 37:45.365
BUT IF YOU DON'T THINK
YOUR CLIENT

37:45.398 --> 37:46.933
CAN GO UP ANY FURTHER,

37:46.966 --> 37:49.069
I THINK
WE SHOULD JUST CALL IT QUITS.

37:50.070 --> 37:53.873
THAT POUT FACE ISN'T GONNA WORK.

37:53.907 --> 37:56.676
- UM, I'M GONNA CALL HER.

37:56.710 --> 37:59.245
- I NEED YOUR BEST AND FINAL.

37:59.279 --> 38:00.847
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.048
- [groans]

38:02.082 --> 38:03.817
GETTING THEM
DOWN TO $6.7 MILLION

38:03.850 --> 38:06.252
IS A GREAT START,

38:06.286 --> 38:08.455
BUT I THINK I CAN GET THEM DOWN
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

38:08.488 --> 38:10.757
IF I CAN GET THEM
UNDER $6.5 MILLION,

38:10.790 --> 38:12.625
THEN I KNOW I'VE GOTTEN BARBARA
A GOOD DEAL.

38:12.659 --> 38:15.595
[cell phone ringing]

38:17.030 --> 38:18.765
- HEY, BARBARA, IT'S RYAN.

38:20.667 --> 38:22.702
- GOOD, ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD.

38:22.736 --> 38:25.405
THEY CAME DOWN $300,000,

38:25.438 --> 38:26.940
WHICH I THINK IS GREAT.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.408
I THINK
THAT'S A GREAT FIRST COUNTER.

38:28.441 --> 38:31.044
AND NOW
THEY WANT OUR BEST AND FINAL.

38:35.048 --> 38:36.716
- ALL RIGHT,
SO THEY'RE PROBABLY WANTING US

38:36.750 --> 38:38.084
TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE.

38:38.118 --> 38:40.854
AND IF WE COME UP JUST
A COUPLE EXTRA HUNDRED GRAND,

38:40.887 --> 38:43.456
I THINK I CAN GET YOU
THIS TOWN HOUSE.

38:49.062 --> 38:49.963
HELLO.

38:50.063 --> 38:51.164
- HI.

38:51.197 --> 38:53.433
- SO THIS $6.25 MILLION,
THIS IS GONE.

38:53.466 --> 38:58.505
SHE IS COMING BACK
WITH AN ABSOLUTE BEST AND FINAL

38:58.538 --> 39:01.207
OF $6,450,000.

39:01.241 --> 39:02.842
- BEST AND FINAL?

39:02.876 --> 39:06.046
- $6.45 MILLION, BEST AND FINAL.
- YOU'RE NOT MESSING?

39:06.079 --> 39:07.213
- I WILL CLOSE THIS TOMORROW.

39:07.247 --> 39:10.417
- LET ME JUST TEXT AND SEE.

39:10.450 --> 39:12.052
- SO YOU JUST TEXT THEM
THE COUNTER?

39:12.085 --> 39:13.086
- YES.

39:13.119 --> 39:14.087
- AND NOW WE WAIT?

39:14.120 --> 39:16.056
- AND NOW WE WAIT.

39:16.089 --> 39:19.492
- $6.45 MILLION
IS ABOUT $1,700 A FOOT,

39:19.526 --> 39:21.361
WHICH IS KIND OF ON THE LOW SIDE
FOR THE AREA.

39:21.394 --> 39:23.296
BOM, BOM, BOM, BOM.

39:23.329 --> 39:24.864
AND IF PEGGY'S SELLERS
WANTED TO,

39:24.898 --> 39:28.335
YOU KNOW, THEY COULD WAIT
AND TRY TO GET $1,800 A FOOT,

39:28.368 --> 39:31.371
BUT THEY COULD END UP WAITING
FOR MONTHS

39:31.404 --> 39:32.372
AND NOT SEE ANOTHER OFFER.

39:32.405 --> 39:33.907
- OKAY.

39:33.940 --> 39:36.109
- AND I'M PRAYING THEY'RE
SMART ENOUGH TO REALIZE THAT.

39:36.142 --> 39:37.243
OKAY, WHAT?

39:37.277 --> 39:38.445
- I'M READING IT.
RELAX.

39:38.478 --> 39:39.546
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S A TEXT.

39:39.579 --> 39:40.780
HE DIDN'T WRITE YOU,
LIKE, A NOVEL.

39:40.814 --> 39:42.382
CAN I SEE IT?

39:42.415 --> 39:43.683
- $6.45 MILLION.

39:43.717 --> 39:45.352
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

39:45.385 --> 39:47.754
- $6.45 MILLION ACCEPTED.

39:47.787 --> 39:49.055
- [grunts]

39:49.055 --> 39:51.291
- YOU HAVE TO GET ME
ALL THE INFORMATION TONIGHT.

39:51.324 --> 39:52.392
- $6.45 MILLION, DEAL.

39:52.425 --> 39:53.393
I THINK WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

39:53.426 --> 39:54.594
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

39:54.627 --> 39:57.063
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- I'LL SEE YOU?

39:57.063 --> 40:00.567
OH, I WAS GONNA GIVE YOU--
WAS THAT WEIRD?

40:00.600 --> 40:02.802
- WHAT THE F[bleep]?

40:02.836 --> 40:04.037
- COMING UP...

40:04.070 --> 40:05.839
- WHEN DID YOU KNOW
THERE WAS A CONTRACT OUT?

40:05.872 --> 40:07.674
- IF YOU WANT TO BE ANGRY AT ME,
SO BE IT.

40:07.707 --> 40:09.142
- YOU SAW
THAT I WANTED TO SELL THIS

40:09.175 --> 40:10.143
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

40:10.176 --> 40:12.145
- DROP 50 LISPENARD.

40:12.178 --> 40:14.180
YOU LOST IT.

40:38.905 --> 40:40.507
- IT'S TOO LOUD, LUIS.

40:40.540 --> 40:42.742
IF YOU WANT TO TALK,
LET'S GO UPSTAIRS.

40:42.776 --> 40:44.210
LET'S GO.

40:48.515 --> 40:51.051
- I AM JUST TRYING TO MAKE SENSE
OF ALL THIS.

40:51.084 --> 40:54.888
IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT THERE WAS A CONTRACT OUT,

40:54.921 --> 40:58.124
I WOULD HAVE NOT LET A BROKER
THINK THAT THEIR OFFER

40:58.158 --> 40:59.359
IS THE ONLY ONE ON THE TABLE.

40:59.392 --> 41:00.894
- I ALREADY SENT OUT A CONTRACT.

41:00.927 --> 41:02.562
- WHY ARE WE
HAVING A CONVERSATION?

41:02.595 --> 41:04.230
- IT'S--WHOA.

41:04.264 --> 41:06.299
FREDRIK EMBARRASSED ME
IN FRONT OF THAT BROKER.

41:06.332 --> 41:08.868
I LOOKED I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN MY OWN LISTING.

41:10.670 --> 41:12.272
- OOH, NICE VIEW.

41:12.305 --> 41:13.273
- VERY NICE.
- HI, GIRLS.

41:13.306 --> 41:14.841
I GET THAT LUIS
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT IT,

41:14.874 --> 41:17.077
BUT I'M SO FRUSTRATED.

41:17.110 --> 41:18.611
HE DOESN'T WANT TO LISTEN TO ME.

41:18.645 --> 41:20.080
HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE
DIRECTION.

41:20.113 --> 41:21.414
IT'S LIKE, "I DON'T NEED YOU."

41:21.448 --> 41:24.184
- OKAY, THANK YOU, SIR.

41:24.217 --> 41:27.153
SO THERE IS
REALLY A CONTRACT SIGNED?

41:27.187 --> 41:28.154
TELL ME THE TRUTH.
