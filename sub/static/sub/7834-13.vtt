D'oh!

01:10.570 --> 01:12.902
Oh, Doctor, I'm crazy!

01:22.415 --> 01:25.543
<i>Welcome back</i>
<i>to America's favorite game show-</i>

01:25.652 --> 01:27.984
<i>Me Wantee!</i>

01:28.088 --> 01:32.354
<i>And here's that</i>
<i>question-asking guy, Virgil Sinclair!</i>

01:32.459 --> 01:35.326
- All right, Moe Szyslak.
- Yes, Virgil.

01:35.428 --> 01:39.387
Yesterday, we asked if you wanted
to risk it all for $500,000.

01:39.499 --> 01:41.262
And you stalled for 20 minutes.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.392
Yes. Yes, I did.
I was told to.

01:43.503 --> 01:46.495
Hey, that's great.
But now we must have your answer...

01:46.606 --> 01:49.131
in the next 10 or 15 minutes.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.608
Ooh.

01:51.711 --> 01:54.305
You want some of this?
Well, do ya?

01:54.414 --> 01:58.646
- I can honestly say I do.
- All right then! For half a million dollars...

01:58.751 --> 02:02.346
<i>which of the following</i>
<i>is not a subatomic particle?</i>

02:02.455 --> 02:04.423
Oy.

02:09.929 --> 02:12.898
Oh, boy.
All right, let's see here.

02:12.999 --> 02:15.763
Uh, well, I was born in Indiana.

02:15.869 --> 02:19.566
So that ain't it.
And, uh- Hmm.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.367
I better call my lifeline.

02:23.510 --> 02:27.139
Hello? Hey, Moe.
We're watching you on TV!

02:27.247 --> 02:29.147
Yeah, I know, Homer.

02:29.249 --> 02:31.376
<i>So, how's that bowel obstruction doing?</i>

02:31.484 --> 02:35.352
Homer, please!
I got a nuclear-type question here.

02:35.455 --> 02:39.391
Well, it all starts when a "nulecule"
comes out of its nest.

02:39.492 --> 02:43.292
- The answer is bonbon!
- I'm gonna say "bonbon."

02:43.396 --> 02:46.695
Bonbon, eh, Moe?
Is that your ultimate response?

02:46.799 --> 02:49.859
- Yeah-huh.
- Ohh. You are... correct!

02:52.372 --> 02:56.468
Well, Moe, would you like to stop where
you are, or try for one million dollars?

02:59.212 --> 03:02.079
Well, gee, I really do love currency.

03:02.182 --> 03:05.879
But, um, I think I'm gonna play it safe
and stick with what I got.

03:05.985 --> 03:07.680
- You're the boss.
- Yes, I am.

03:11.591 --> 03:14.219
Aw, this quiz show crap
is just a fad.

03:14.327 --> 03:17.854
- Fad or not, it's here to stay.
- And it's killing your show in the ratings.

03:17.964 --> 03:19.989
What do you want from me?
I do a kids' show.

03:20.099 --> 03:22.659
And it's a classic.
We just want you to open it up.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.862
Run wild, shatter the boundaries,
slash and burn.

03:24.971 --> 03:27.496
- Without alienating anyone.
- Oy!

03:27.607 --> 03:31.134
These <i>ferkachted</i> network notes.
Can you believe this?

03:32.345 --> 03:34.711
All we're saying is be dangerous,
but warm.

03:34.814 --> 03:38.079
And edgy-cute.

03:38.184 --> 03:40.084
Did that exit work for you?

03:40.186 --> 03:42.518
- I'd like to see it without the scream.
- I was just thinking that.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.759
Hey, hey, kids!

03:48.861 --> 03:52.854
Let's hear it for Madam Mimi
and her cheese-seeking poodles!

03:55.168 --> 04:00.196
We'll be back with a sketch
set in the craziest place!

04:00.306 --> 04:03.139
A restaurant!

04:03.243 --> 04:05.234
And roll commercial.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.939
Krusty, yeah, quick thought
about this restaurant set.

04:08.047 --> 04:10.345
- Huh?
- Could it look more like a diner?

04:10.450 --> 04:14.079
- Ooh, the Seinfeld diner.
- Are you nuts? I'm on in five seconds!

04:14.187 --> 04:16.849
- 'Cause the great thing about Seinfeld was the-
- You're on, Krusty.

04:18.825 --> 04:23.262
Ah, nothing like a meal
in a fine restaurant.

04:23.363 --> 04:26.093
Ah, here comes the waitress.

04:26.199 --> 04:29.930
We're losing male teens.
Can you get jiggy with something?

04:30.036 --> 04:33.904
You're giving me notes while I'm on the air?
That tears it!

04:34.007 --> 04:37.067
Folks, I've been in show biz
for 61 years.

04:37.176 --> 04:40.202
But now these jerks
have sucked all the fun out.

04:40.313 --> 04:43.680
I don't need 12 suits
telling me which way to pee.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.808
For "pee,"
could you substitute "whiz"?

04:45.918 --> 04:48.386
I don't know. That could upset
the Cheez Whiz people.

04:48.488 --> 04:51.013
- I was just thinking that.
- I can't take it anymore!

04:51.124 --> 04:54.252
Folks, don't miss this Friday's show.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.260
It'll be my last.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.796
Quitting show biz.

04:58.898 --> 05:02.698
- No, I like the area. But where does it go?
- Get away from me!

05:02.802 --> 05:05.327
- Wait!
- We have more notes!

05:07.640 --> 05:10.700
Get off, damn you!

05:10.810 --> 05:14.507
You can kill me,
but two more will take my place!

05:19.085 --> 05:21.053
I can't believe Krusty's retiring.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.145
This is tragic.

05:23.256 --> 05:26.919
A world without Krusty.
What would that be like?

05:28.594 --> 05:30.562
- What's on TV?
- Nutsy the Clown.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.131
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!

05:35.201 --> 05:40.138
Well, I think it's good for a show to go
off the air before it becomes stale and repetitive.

05:40.239 --> 05:42.173
Maggie shot Mr. Burns again!

05:48.414 --> 05:52.316
Krusty the Clown's retirement
has provoked an outpouring of anguish...

05:52.418 --> 05:56.184
not seen since the small plane crash
that killed the Banana Splits.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.621
We now go live to Krustylu Studios.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.190
What's the mood there, Chief Clancy Wiggum?

06:03.296 --> 06:05.628
These kids are getting
a little out of hand, Kent.

06:05.732 --> 06:09.566
So we're gonna have to fire
the time-out gas.

06:09.669 --> 06:13.969
Hey, Kent, are you guys still having that contest...

06:14.073 --> 06:16.405
where we guess what city
the weather girl's in?

06:16.509 --> 06:19.501
- That was eight years ago.
- Is it Pittsburgh?

06:19.612 --> 06:23.139
I spoke to Krusty
about his legacy of laughter.

06:23.249 --> 06:28.277
Kent, the young people today,
they think comedy is dirty words.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.848
It's not. It's words that sound dirty,
like "mukluk."

06:32.959 --> 06:35.553
<i>Mukluk.</i>

06:35.661 --> 06:38.323
You like that?
No charge. Mukluk.

06:38.431 --> 06:40.228
Mukluk.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.358
Oh, can it,
you tiresome tot-sitter.

06:42.468 --> 06:44.595
I was the risible one in our dyad.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.569
Ever watch the old episodes?

06:46.672 --> 06:48.537
Oh, Kent, that's a sad story.

06:48.641 --> 06:51.633
I taped over all my old episodes.

06:51.744 --> 06:56.340
Oh, you know, I had a thing forJudgeJudy
and blank tape was 3.99.

06:56.449 --> 06:58.883
What would you do?

06:58.985 --> 07:01.886
Those are my shows!

07:01.988 --> 07:04.548
Frankly, Kent,
those episodes were no big loss.

07:04.657 --> 07:08.753
The show didn't really get funny until
we fired Sideshow Bob and hired whozits.

07:08.861 --> 07:12.729
You've erased my past.

07:12.832 --> 07:15.892
Now I'll erase your future.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.902
Hey, hey! Lights out!

07:18.004 --> 07:21.303
Oh, honestly.
At Chino they get to stay up till 9:00.

07:21.407 --> 07:24.001
Now, Bob, I've talked
to the warden at Chino...

07:24.110 --> 07:26.943
and that's just not true.

07:28.347 --> 07:29.916
Your Honor, my incarceration
is cruel and unusual punishment.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.714
Your Honor, my incarceration
is cruel and unusual punishment.

07:32.819 --> 07:37.688
First, my prison-issued shower sandals
are grossly undersized.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.020
Secondly, the prison book club...

07:40.126 --> 07:44.187
consists mainly of prisoners
who club me with books.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.265
These are from
the new Tom Clancy.

07:46.365 --> 07:49.698
Although it's less painful than reading him.
Am I right, folks?

07:49.802 --> 07:51.736
Motion granted.
Release the prisoner.

07:57.743 --> 08:01.144
Now don't try anything
funny this time, Bob.

08:01.247 --> 08:03.738
I'm gonna be on you
like red beans on-

08:03.850 --> 08:06.011
Hey, hey, hey, don't walk so fast.

08:06.118 --> 08:09.986
Hey, no fair. You got long legs.
I got these little bitty hooves.

08:10.089 --> 08:11.989
Bob!

08:15.161 --> 08:18.255
Okay, here's your storage locker.
Just the way you left it.

08:18.364 --> 08:22.562
Thank you, Raphael.
Now this is a ticklish question, but-

08:22.668 --> 08:24.863
You want to live in the box?
Cost you two bucks a day.

08:24.971 --> 08:29.601
Oh, thank you, kind innkeeper.

08:29.709 --> 08:31.836
- You gonna want a wake-up jab?
- Please.

08:31.944 --> 08:33.844
No problemo.

08:37.149 --> 08:39.116
<i>Hiya, neighbor!</i>

08:39.217 --> 08:41.583
Hey, what-what-
what you writing there?

08:41.687 --> 08:45.054
If you must know,
it's an exquisite scheme for revenge.

08:45.157 --> 08:48.092
Revenge, huh?
Half the guys in here are working on that.

08:51.597 --> 08:54.191
Well, mine's better.

08:57.870 --> 09:02.933
Phase one begins in 10, nine, eight-

09:03.042 --> 09:06.569
Oh, I can't wait!

09:06.679 --> 09:11.480
Now, Bob, your graduate degrees
more than qualify you to be assistant janitor.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.609
My blushes.

09:13.719 --> 09:17.655
But I am a bit troubled
by your constant attempts to murder people.

09:17.757 --> 09:20.920
To be fair, most of those people
were Bart Simpson.

09:21.027 --> 09:23.587
Good luck.

09:23.696 --> 09:26.096
That kid's like the Road Runner.
He won't go down.

09:26.198 --> 09:29.065
Tell me about it.

09:29.168 --> 09:31.295
Hey. You know, Bob...

09:31.404 --> 09:34.862
your voice would be perfect for
the school's morning announcements.

09:34.974 --> 09:39.138
Attention.
The French Club picnic has been canceled.

09:39.245 --> 09:42.476
- <i>Quel dommage.</i>
- You're hired!

09:42.582 --> 09:46.609
It begins.

09:50.756 --> 09:54.590
I mean, my announcing career.
That's what's beginning.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.665
<i>Good morning, Springfield Elementary.</i>

10:00.766 --> 10:04.293
In the Lost and Found today,
we have one plaid kilt.

10:04.403 --> 10:08.271
- I believe the clan is Graham-Monroe.
- Oh.

10:08.374 --> 10:11.866
This new morning announcer
sounds awfully familiar.

10:11.978 --> 10:17.780
<i>And finally, Bart Simpson</i>
<i>should immediately proceed unescorted...</i>

10:17.883 --> 10:22.843
to the old sports equipment shed
behind the school.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.823
So long, suckers!

10:32.198 --> 10:36.532
<i>Ring around the rosie.</i>

10:47.813 --> 10:51.010
<i>Hello, Bart.</i>

10:51.117 --> 10:53.483
Oh, it's you, Bob.
How you doing?

10:53.586 --> 10:57.283
No screams?
Not even an "eep"?

10:57.390 --> 10:59.290
Hey, I'm not afraid of you.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.384
Every time we tangle,
you wind up in jail. I'm 6 and 0.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.986
I'll admit that the record
is a little one-sided.

11:05.097 --> 11:08.692
But this time, I cannot fail.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.868
Rakes. My old archenemy.

11:14.974 --> 11:18.842
- I thought I was your archenemy.
- I have a life outside of you, Bart.

11:23.816 --> 11:27.877
- What are you gonna do to me?
- Oh, believe me, I have a plan.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.615
Let's see. " Get job as school announcer.
Lure Bart to shed.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.953
Secure same to chair with rope."
Ah, here we are.

11:33.059 --> 11:35.857
"Have Bart kill Krusty."

11:35.961 --> 11:38.657
Krusty? That's the one man
I would never kill!

11:38.764 --> 11:43.599
Oh, you will kill Krusty
during his final show.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.230
And you won't even know
you're doing it.

11:48.340 --> 11:51.673
Watch the shiny quarter, Bart.

11:51.777 --> 11:54.610
That's it. Oh, damn it!
Where'd it go?

11:54.714 --> 11:57.615
- I needed that for laundry!
- Hey, stupid.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.412
You looked.

12:04.824 --> 12:08.021
Yes. That will do.

12:08.127 --> 12:11.119
Watch the spiral, Bart.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.358
<i>Let it entrance you</i>
<i>with its twirliness.</i>

12:14.467 --> 12:17.664
<i>Twirliness.</i>

12:17.770 --> 12:19.294
You are in my power.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.430
I am at your command.

12:21.540 --> 12:25.374
I didn't say anything about command.
You're in my power. Say so.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.412
I am in your power.

12:27.513 --> 12:31.210
Excellent. Actually, go back to command.
No, power. Power.

12:32.618 --> 12:37.317
Look. Krusty invited us
to the taping of his last episode.

12:39.325 --> 12:41.225
Hello, family.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.852
Where have you been, young man?
It's nearly bedtime.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.557
I was- I was-

12:46.665 --> 12:50.624
If anyone asks,
you were at the flower shop.

12:50.736 --> 12:51.862
I was at the flower shop.

12:51.971 --> 12:54.371
Oh, yeah.
Uh, I was at the flower shop too.

12:54.473 --> 12:57.465
Yep, getting drunk at the old flower shop.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.919
Now to see if you will
really attack your hero.

13:12.124 --> 13:14.183
Yes! Yes!

13:14.293 --> 13:17.057
Work the groin!

13:17.163 --> 13:19.996
- Excuse me. Could you take our picture?
- Aye-uh.

13:20.099 --> 13:22.863
It should focus automatically.

13:22.968 --> 13:24.595
It do.

13:24.703 --> 13:28.571
- Chief, you might want to take a look outside.
- That's it!

13:28.674 --> 13:33.304
Kill Krusty!
Just like you'll kill him tomorrow night!

13:33.412 --> 13:36.973
Oh, it's so great to see
a kid using a wooden bat.

13:37.082 --> 13:40.210
These days, it's all aluminum
this and George W. That.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.514
Hey, Chief, look what I got
in my Laffy Meal.

13:42.621 --> 13:45.886
- Aw, mini-pinball!
- Hey, give that back.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.858
Give what back, Lou?

13:48.961 --> 13:51.930
Oh, yeah!

13:58.537 --> 14:01.904
Good evening, folks.
And welcome to my final clown-cast.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.805
The word "legend"
has many definitions.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.674
This is for Sideshow Bob.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.079
Marvelous, marvelous.
Funny till the end.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.781
Moment of silence.
Well, it's my show now.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.085
Thank you. Thank you.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.162
Thank you.

14:25.331 --> 14:27.231
Hmm?

14:27.333 --> 14:29.927
Oh. Just a dream.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.526
But tonight I will taste...

14:32.638 --> 14:36.904
the sweet nectar of vengeance!

14:37.009 --> 14:39.000
<i>Bug spray.</i>

14:55.127 --> 14:59.063
Kent Brockman here
at Krusty the Clown's final show.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.394
And here comes out-of-work actor
Ranier Wolfcastle.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.663
Someone please give me a job.

15:04.770 --> 15:06.863
I've lowered my quote
to eight million.

15:06.972 --> 15:09.440
Hear that, Hollywood?
The boy wants to work.

15:09.541 --> 15:13.033
I do nude scene, I play nerd.
Don't make me punch your throat!

15:13.145 --> 15:14.612
Always a delight.

15:26.158 --> 15:29.559
<i>And now, retiring for the fifth and final time...</i>

15:29.662 --> 15:32.790
<i>Krusty the Clown!</i>

15:39.338 --> 15:41.363
Thank you, folks.
Now fasten your funny belts...

15:41.473 --> 15:43.100
as our own Chimpendale's dancer...

15:43.208 --> 15:45.438
gives you the full monkey!

15:45.544 --> 15:47.512
<i># I believe in miracles #</i>

15:47.613 --> 15:49.205
<i>Take it off!</i>

15:49.315 --> 15:54.014
<i># Where you from, you sexy thing</i>
<i>Sexy thing, you #</i>

15:54.119 --> 15:57.384
<i>Bart.</i>

15:57.489 --> 15:59.821
<i>Bart.</i>

15:59.925 --> 16:03.292
It's time, Bart.
Time to blow up the clown.

16:03.395 --> 16:06.455
Time to blow up the clown.

16:06.565 --> 16:09.261
Go. Blow.

16:09.368 --> 16:12.030
And now a special treat.

16:12.137 --> 16:17.734
My TV debut on " The Milk of Magnesia's
Summer Cavalcade." Let's watch.

16:17.843 --> 16:21.404
Look at me. I'm Kaputnik,
the Russian satellite.

16:21.513 --> 16:24.971
Oh, the Bolshoi's doing
the <i>Nutcracker</i> in my pants!

16:25.084 --> 16:28.884
Back then you couldn't say "pants" on TV.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.013
I was banned for 10 years.

16:31.123 --> 16:34.456
Finally I got a second chance
on <i>Laugh-In.</i>

16:34.560 --> 16:36.152
Hey, Krusty.

16:36.261 --> 16:39.560
What do you get when you cross
a chicken with a bagel?

16:39.665 --> 16:42.463
<i>The</i> ferkachted <i>doors are stuck!</i>

16:42.568 --> 16:45.332
<i>Don'tjust stare, Arte.</i>
<i>Help me!</i>

16:45.437 --> 16:49.897
Those lousy shutters
set me back another 22 years.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.613
Mmm!

16:59.718 --> 17:02.619
That's good plastic explosive.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.787
Now, my little hypno-assassin...

17:10.896 --> 17:13.160
your cue to attack
will be when Krusty says...

17:13.265 --> 17:17.201
"I've never had such a great audience."

17:17.301 --> 17:21.329
You will run up and hug him,
blowing each of you to smithereens.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.339
Whatever.

17:23.442 --> 17:27.208
Now we're gonna show you some clips from-

17:27.311 --> 17:30.907
Oh, no.
I wanted to keep this quiet.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.883
Can I embarrass this guy for a moment?

17:33.986 --> 17:37.513
Three years ago,
Krusty pledged over a million dollars...

17:37.623 --> 17:39.557
to start Krusty's Care Centers.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.853
Please, stop already.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.360
To this day,
Krusty has not given us a dime.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.363
Has he, Frances?

17:46.465 --> 17:48.831
I'm cold all the time.

17:48.934 --> 17:53.098
Oh, look.
It was all a bookkeeping snafu.

17:53.205 --> 17:55.765
- Can I have the check now?
- Now? Eh-

17:55.874 --> 17:58.809
- Uh, sure.
- God bless you, Krusty.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.812
And if my banker's watching...

18:01.914 --> 18:06.578
let nothing <i>stop</i> you
from <i>payment</i> of this check.

18:11.857 --> 18:15.190
Ah, the catwalk.
A perfect vantage point...

18:15.294 --> 18:18.127
for revenge.

18:20.299 --> 18:24.326
Ah, kettle chips.
The perfect side dish...

18:24.436 --> 18:26.461
for revenge.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.597
What a special night.

18:28.707 --> 18:33.144
And you know something?
I've never had such a great audience.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.213
Hmm?

18:38.250 --> 18:40.241
- We've had a lot of laughs-
- Well, Krusty...

18:40.352 --> 18:43.048
this is your Waterloo.

18:43.155 --> 18:47.489
Soon you'll be Napoléon Blownapart.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.891
- Ew. Terrible.
- Oh, hush up, Leo!

18:49.995 --> 18:53.658
You know, I'd like to thank God
for all my success...

18:53.765 --> 18:57.292
even though I never worshipped
or believed in him in any way.

18:57.402 --> 19:00.200
But before I sweep up
my last spotlight...

19:00.305 --> 19:02.671
<i>there's one thing I've gotta say.</i>

19:02.774 --> 19:05.174
Over the years, I've-

19:05.277 --> 19:07.609
A lot of-whoa-

19:07.713 --> 19:11.615
And I've-
My share of- aooga!

19:11.717 --> 19:13.810
But there's only one thing
I'm ashamed of.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.944
Ashamed?

19:16.054 --> 19:18.648
There was a man
who used to work for me.

19:18.757 --> 19:20.850
A man of grace and humor.

19:20.959 --> 19:24.895
But I mistreated him and
drove him to a life of crime.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.057
So wherever you are,
I just want to say...

19:28.167 --> 19:32.263
Sideshow Bob, I'm sorry.

19:32.371 --> 19:38.207
# Oh, Bob, you repaid my abuse
with raw hatred #

19:38.310 --> 19:42.269
# But I need you today
Oh, Bob #

19:42.381 --> 19:46.875
#Well, you went to Apu's
and you framed me #

19:46.985 --> 19:49.385
# So they locked me away ##

19:49.488 --> 19:53.618
Oh, that sweet, funny man.

19:56.695 --> 19:59.255
Oh, no! My boy bomb!

20:00.265 --> 20:03.234
Well, good night and-
Ah, look.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.360
It's a towheaded little fan.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.439
What do you say, folks?
Should I hug him?

20:17.249 --> 20:20.082
No!

20:20.185 --> 20:21.743
Hmm?

20:30.095 --> 20:33.553
- Oh, God! A bomb!
- I was just thinking that.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.656
Hmm.

20:37.536 --> 20:39.401
What happened?
Was anyone hurt?

20:39.504 --> 20:42.029
Just some network executives.

20:51.617 --> 20:53.812
We have notes.

20:53.919 --> 20:58.822
Have you thought
about Dave Chappelle? Destroy!

21:00.225 --> 21:03.388
Okay, everybody.
Say "funny."

21:03.495 --> 21:05.690
Funny!

21:05.797 --> 21:08.960
Perfect.

21:09.067 --> 21:13.401
Krusty, I'm so sorry
about the attempted murder.

21:13.505 --> 21:16.167
Will ya stop with the "sorry"?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.368
Every time you try to kill me...

21:18.477 --> 21:21.378
my ratings go through the roof,
you nut!

21:21.480 --> 21:23.607
We are good together, Krusty.

21:23.715 --> 21:26.741
It makes me sad
that you're getting the death penalty.

21:26.852 --> 21:29.753
Oh! Don't remind me.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.224
Okay, where do you
wanna do this thing?

21:33.325 --> 21:37.989
- Isn't it customary to have a trial?
- Oh, a wise guy, huh?

22:24.409 --> 22:26.377
Shh!
