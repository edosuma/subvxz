00:30.704 --> 00:33.572
<i>send him an angel of light,</i>

00:33.574 --> 00:35.477

01:04.537 --> 01:06.938
<i>This is a city of sinners</i>

01:06.940 --> 01:08.609
<i>and far worse</i>

01:09.677 --> 01:14.279
<i>where the damned and
the forsaken walk the streets.</i>

01:14.281 --> 01:15.646
<i>Somebody's taken my son!</i>

01:15.648 --> 01:16.982
<i>Please help me!</i>

01:16.984 --> 01:19.618
<i>Calm down, ma'am.
Can you tell me where you are?</i>

01:19.620 --> 01:20.651
<i>The angels...</i>

01:22.623 --> 01:25.223
<i>...they left a long time ago.</i>

01:25.225 --> 01:26.458
<i>He's into my home!</i>

01:26.460 --> 01:28.493
<i>She's dead!
He killed my wife!</i>

01:28.495 --> 01:29.860
<i>Police are on their way.</i>

01:29.862 --> 01:31.429
<i>Please, try to remain calm, sir.</i>

01:31.431 --> 01:33.532
<i>The Lord
has prepared his people</i>

01:33.534 --> 01:35.333
<i>for a great slaughter</i>

01:35.335 --> 01:37.603
<i>This guy is dead
for sure, ma'am.</i>

01:37.605 --> 01:41.306
<i>And He has
chosen their executioners.</i>

01:41.308 --> 01:43.541
<i>The guy is
still unconscious.</i>

01:43.543 --> 01:45.309
<i>There's fucking blood all over!</i>

01:45.311 --> 01:47.781
<i>There are
those whose teeth are swords,</i>

01:49.582 --> 01:52.286
<i>whose fangs are knives,</i>

01:53.954 --> 01:57.823
<i>put here to devour the
weak from off the earth.</i>

01:59.892 --> 02:03.331
<i>Their blood will be
poured out into the dust</i>

02:04.698 --> 02:09.000
<i>and their bodies will lay
rotting on the ground.</i>

02:11.605 --> 02:13.504
<i>And no wonder,</i>

02:13.506 --> 02:16.874
<i>for even Satan disguises himself</i>

02:16.876 --> 02:18.843
<i>as an angel of light.</i>

02:20.648 --> 02:22.713
<i>Though light survives</i>

02:22.715 --> 02:26.787
<i>and the battle between
good and evil persists,</i>

02:28.922 --> 02:30.758
<i>angel or demon,</i>

02:31.725 --> 02:35.427
<i>all will appear before
the Judgment seat of God.</i>

02:35.429 --> 02:37.528
<i>Please, my brother.</i>

02:37.530 --> 02:39.730
<i>Yet blessed are the merciful...</i>

02:39.732 --> 02:40.998
<i>The window is broken.</i>

02:41.000 --> 02:43.034
<i>...for they shall
receive mercy...</i>

02:43.036 --> 02:44.903
<i>He's got...</i>

02:44.905 --> 02:48.473
<i>...so that all may
receive what is due.</i>

02:48.475 --> 02:49.874
<i>If you could tell
me your name and location,</i>

02:49.876 --> 02:51.510
<i>we're going to dispatch
an officer to your area.</i>

02:51.512 --> 02:53.378
<i>And be saved.</i>

02:53.380 --> 02:55.580
<i>Uhm... Uhm...</i>

02:55.582 --> 02:56.851
<i>My name is Macy.</i>

02:59.553 --> 03:02.486
<i>Of those who
have sinned against the Lord,</i>

03:02.488 --> 03:05.891
<i>I will make you as
helpless as a blind man</i>

03:05.893 --> 03:07.859
<i>searching for a path.</i>

03:11.364 --> 03:13.900
<i>As it's only in the darkness</i>

03:14.968 --> 03:17.272
<i>that we find ourselves</i>

03:20.374 --> 03:23.474
<i>or find our Maker's wrath.</i>

04:03.383 --> 04:04.749
Help!

04:04.751 --> 04:08.687
Help! Somebody help me!

04:08.689 --> 04:09.691
Oh, my God!

04:13.393 --> 04:14.761
Oh, my God, it's you.

04:17.731 --> 04:19.334
Who did this to you?

04:21.034 --> 04:22.567
Drake.

04:22.569 --> 04:23.604
Who?

04:28.976 --> 04:30.478
Help me.

04:31.411 --> 04:32.911
You can help him.

04:32.913 --> 04:35.450
But you can't save him, Macy.

04:36.149 --> 04:39.053
He doesn't need a hospital,
he needs a priest.

04:44.791 --> 04:46.426
He's going to die.

05:30.637 --> 05:31.672
Put it down.

05:47.788 --> 05:49.424
Tough break, shooter.

05:50.791 --> 05:51.892
Next time.

05:53.159 --> 05:55.626
There ain't going
to be no next time.

05:55.628 --> 05:56.797
And I'm walking.

05:59.632 --> 06:02.000
Hey, you got two
strikes against you.

06:02.002 --> 06:03.471
Don't do anything stupid.

06:11.577 --> 06:12.579
Thanks.

06:22.856 --> 06:23.990
Well...

06:25.158 --> 06:27.128
it makes you better,
you know, Corbin,

06:28.628 --> 06:32.531
especially when pieces
of shit like this get away,

06:32.533 --> 06:35.236
it's a hard thing, but it
does make us better, so.

06:36.702 --> 06:38.236
- Better?
- Mm-Mm.

06:38.238 --> 06:39.303
I should have fucking shot him.

06:39.305 --> 06:41.709
We could've shot him.

07:17.209 --> 07:18.245
Jack.

07:38.764 --> 07:39.800
Who are you?

07:41.767 --> 07:43.236
I'm a friend of the family.

07:44.837 --> 07:46.006
I got no family.

07:49.108 --> 07:51.912
I see Jack's got you
in a tight leash.

07:53.846 --> 07:55.716
Yeah, he's a good man,

07:57.216 --> 07:58.752
but he's not your father.

08:00.954 --> 08:02.323
How did you know I'll be here?

08:05.791 --> 08:07.027
You following me?

08:08.060 --> 08:09.262
It's not a good idea.

08:10.731 --> 08:13.063
It's not difficult
to spot a wolf

08:13.065 --> 08:15.101
in a flock of sheep, kid.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.105
You should have shot him.

08:20.039 --> 08:22.342
We have a few things
in common, you and I.

08:23.844 --> 08:24.844
Yeah?

08:26.012 --> 08:28.248
Yeah. We like guns.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.587
Looks old.

08:33.352 --> 08:34.655
Belonged to your father.

08:35.855 --> 08:37.624
He never used it on people.

08:38.691 --> 08:39.726
You knew my father?

08:40.860 --> 08:43.830
Yeah. And your sweet mother.

08:45.799 --> 08:47.101
My parents are dead.

08:50.436 --> 08:52.072
You know anything about them?

08:55.142 --> 08:58.108
My mother was Irish,
my father played ball.

08:58.110 --> 09:00.879
He won the World Series, kid.

09:00.881 --> 09:02.016
Yeah, he did.

09:02.949 --> 09:05.784
The thing was that being
a baseball player

09:05.786 --> 09:07.220
was just a cover.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.020
Cover for what?

09:10.022 --> 09:12.926
The battle with
demons and destiny.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.129
Demons, huh?

09:17.363 --> 09:18.365
Okay.

09:19.366 --> 09:21.669
The never-ending fight

09:22.735 --> 09:24.270
between good and evil.

09:25.372 --> 09:29.644
Your parents came from
a long line of hunters.

09:32.179 --> 09:33.280
You're one of them.

09:37.983 --> 09:39.387
What's you looking
for ain't here?

09:40.786 --> 09:42.422
- No?
- No.

09:43.323 --> 09:45.823
It's three blocks down on East.

09:45.825 --> 09:47.424
It's called the
fucking hospital.

09:52.898 --> 09:55.001
You're my last rodeo, kid.

09:56.302 --> 09:57.737
I'm almost done.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.712
Your parents were
killed in Los Angeles.

10:06.213 --> 10:08.011
Your dad was there for the game.

10:08.013 --> 10:10.414
But like I said, he was hunting.

10:13.018 --> 10:14.885
They were slaughtered.

10:16.323 --> 10:17.725
It's the truth, Corbin.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.958
What... what are you doing?

10:20.960 --> 10:24.261
I didn't want to tell you
because I wanted to protect you.

10:24.263 --> 10:25.765
It's who they were.

10:26.932 --> 10:28.832
What the fuck is this?

10:28.834 --> 10:30.204
You need to listen to him.

10:33.406 --> 10:34.406
I was there.

10:36.776 --> 10:40.544
Our mission was to
kill their royal blood.

10:40.546 --> 10:42.780
Two brothers.

10:42.782 --> 10:44.050
We got one.

10:44.984 --> 10:47.519
The other one, Drake, got away.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.453
What you're saying is insane!

10:48.455 --> 10:50.989
Drake was behind it
from the beginning.

10:50.991 --> 10:53.491
- You're fucking insane.
- You were the big secret.

10:53.493 --> 10:56.162
You were kept away
from all this evil.

10:59.299 --> 11:02.066
Drake doesn't even
know you exist.

11:02.068 --> 11:03.967
Then why does it matter?

11:03.969 --> 11:05.970
My parents are dead.

11:05.972 --> 11:08.242
And no fucking fairytale
is going to bring them back.

11:12.845 --> 11:14.080
It's your time.

11:16.349 --> 11:19.085
Your dad would want
you to have this.

11:25.057 --> 11:26.259
Godspeed.

11:35.535 --> 11:37.836
It's too soon.

11:37.838 --> 11:40.775
It's history, Jack. And
it's a damn good start.

12:49.508 --> 12:51.845
No!

12:52.945 --> 12:54.214
No!

13:47.400 --> 13:49.069
Shit don't make any sense.

13:51.470 --> 13:52.472
It's all too random.

13:55.208 --> 13:56.310
There's no motive.

13:58.511 --> 13:59.914
Whole thing is spooky.

14:05.352 --> 14:06.487
Motherfucker.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.422
Friend of yours?

14:11.590 --> 14:13.159
Disease, my ass.

14:16.061 --> 14:18.029
Fucking guy raped
a seven-year-old girl

14:18.031 --> 14:20.000
but he got off
on a technicality.

14:22.102 --> 14:24.038
Makes you wonder
if what we even do matters.

14:26.705 --> 14:28.274
Un-fucking-believable.

14:29.275 --> 14:30.209
Right?

14:32.045 --> 14:34.147
If it was my daughter, I would
have killed the sick bastard.

14:35.415 --> 14:36.650
At least put him down.

14:48.127 --> 14:49.729
You think there's more
than one guy doing this?

14:53.299 --> 14:56.303
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

14:57.737 --> 14:59.272
We just need to find them.

15:09.748 --> 15:14.053
<i>I am beautiful.</i>

15:24.664 --> 15:26.100
I am...

15:28.100 --> 15:29.369
...an angel.

15:31.171 --> 15:32.736
I am...

15:32.738 --> 15:37.074
...a cold-blooded
fucking killer.

15:41.448 --> 15:44.184
Everybody wants to fuck me.

15:51.690 --> 15:53.493
Mm...

15:59.165 --> 16:00.398
Chase it.

16:30.629 --> 16:32.130
- Ooh, you like that, baby?
- Oh, yes.

16:32.132 --> 16:33.798
- Yeah?
- Ah-Huh.

16:33.800 --> 16:36.467
- You think I'm beautiful?
- I think you're so beautiful.

16:36.469 --> 16:38.169
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:38.171 --> 16:41.338
- You think I'm sexy?
- You're so sexy, baby.

16:41.340 --> 16:43.241
Yeah, baby!

16:45.445 --> 16:46.446
You like that?

16:47.347 --> 16:50.414
- Yes. Oh, yes!
- Yeah. You like it, huh?

16:55.588 --> 16:57.755
Yeah. Tell me I'm beautiful.

16:57.757 --> 17:00.223
You're so beautiful, baby.

17:00.225 --> 17:03.427
Ah-Huh. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

17:03.429 --> 17:04.698
Tell me you love me!

17:05.664 --> 17:07.564
I love you, baby.

17:07.566 --> 17:08.698
I love you.

17:08.700 --> 17:10.269
Now look at me.

17:11.371 --> 17:12.605
Look at me.

17:46.738 --> 17:48.741
What's this? What the
fuck is going on?

17:51.411 --> 17:53.276
- I'm just trying to help.
- Help?

17:53.278 --> 17:54.680
Why am I chained to a bed?

17:56.783 --> 17:58.651
Because someone
I trust told me to.

18:00.319 --> 18:01.686
For protection.

18:01.688 --> 18:04.725
- I don't need protection.
- Not yours.

18:06.593 --> 18:07.494
Mine.

18:08.527 --> 18:10.794
Shh.

18:10.796 --> 18:11.864
Why are you doing this?

18:16.969 --> 18:18.671
You don't remember me, do you?

18:39.992 --> 18:41.427
We met before.

18:46.966 --> 18:48.368
At the bar.

18:53.038 --> 18:54.708
<i>I was in trouble.</i>

18:59.578 --> 19:01.512
<i>You saved me.</i>

19:23.936 --> 19:25.005
<i>After that,</i>

19:26.072 --> 19:28.072
I asked around

19:28.074 --> 19:29.743
and they just told
me who you were.

19:31.811 --> 19:34.481
You're that detective
working on the missing cases.

19:40.385 --> 19:42.021
My brother is missing.

19:52.798 --> 19:53.933
Yo, Mace.

19:57.903 --> 19:59.640
Shit. What's up, girl?

20:00.640 --> 20:02.605
What do you want?

20:02.607 --> 20:04.975
I came to see you.
Came to see my girl.

20:04.977 --> 20:07.777
I'm not your girl, okay.
You were a mistake.

20:07.779 --> 20:09.449
- Now leave me alone.
- Mistake!

20:10.549 --> 20:11.582
Come on, babe.

20:11.584 --> 20:13.817
I miss my baby, man.

20:13.819 --> 20:16.019
Don't fucking touch me.

20:16.021 --> 20:16.922
Go!

20:18.123 --> 20:19.989
Shit! Come on outside.

20:19.991 --> 20:22.560
Leave it alone, Karl. Go!

20:22.562 --> 20:23.729
Oh!

20:25.465 --> 20:26.433
Macy.

20:27.566 --> 20:29.899
Open the fucking door!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

20:29.901 --> 20:32.803
- No!
- Huh? Just...

20:32.805 --> 20:34.007
Stop that!

20:35.708 --> 20:36.873
Open the fucking door.

20:39.911 --> 20:41.778
Ah, who the fuck is that?

20:41.780 --> 20:43.581
- Just go, okay?
- Who the fuck is that?

20:43.583 --> 20:45.749
- You fucking bitch!
- Just go, Karl!

20:45.751 --> 20:48.151
- Fuck!
- Go!

20:48.153 --> 20:49.722
Fuck, it's like that?

20:50.922 --> 20:53.457
Fuck. All right. What the fuck?

20:53.459 --> 20:54.592
Huh?

20:54.594 --> 20:56.427
Bring that motherfucker
out here.

20:56.429 --> 20:57.964
Let's go!

21:01.633 --> 21:03.868
Leave her alone and get
the fuck out of my building,

21:03.870 --> 21:05.405
you crazy fuck.

21:08.173 --> 21:11.441
All right. Easy, all right.
We're cool, grandma.

21:11.443 --> 21:12.575
Oh, grandma?

21:12.577 --> 21:14.447
You fucking animal. Move!

21:15.180 --> 21:16.083
Easy.

21:17.115 --> 21:17.983
We cool.

21:31.863 --> 21:32.996
Thank you.

21:32.998 --> 21:34.534
You owe me rent.

21:54.653 --> 21:55.988
I know his face.

22:02.795 --> 22:05.098
He's one of twenty-seven
I was looking for.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.068
He was taken a year ago.

22:10.670 --> 22:11.872
He's alive.

22:12.904 --> 22:14.173
I can feel it.

22:17.576 --> 22:19.412
I believe that too.

22:24.784 --> 22:25.951
I was close.

22:56.649 --> 22:57.617
I got you.

23:24.309 --> 23:26.111
Fuck, yeah.
Deeper, bitch.

23:28.014 --> 23:30.046
You better move on,
whoever the fuck you are.

23:30.048 --> 23:31.852
Keep going.
Get back down there.

23:35.587 --> 23:37.123
I said fuck off!

23:42.193 --> 23:43.694
Fuck!

23:43.696 --> 23:44.828
Who the fuck are you?

23:44.830 --> 23:46.600
Get off the fucking car!

23:50.569 --> 23:52.538
What the fuck!

23:54.673 --> 23:55.642
Fuck!

24:00.979 --> 24:03.616
You know that's not just blood
coming out of your ears, right?

24:04.950 --> 24:07.720
That's fluid leaking
from your brain.

24:08.754 --> 24:11.322
That's surgery right
there regardless.

24:11.324 --> 24:12.689
Fuck, man!

24:12.691 --> 24:15.092
I can't feel my
fucking face anymore.

24:15.094 --> 24:17.695
Imagine what I'll do to you
when I drag you out of this car.

24:17.697 --> 24:19.996
Who the hell are you, man?

24:19.998 --> 24:21.066
Who am I?

24:24.836 --> 24:26.272
It's a good question.

24:27.172 --> 24:29.372
Don't kill me, all right. I'll
tell you all you want to know.

24:29.374 --> 24:32.842
I want to know who they are.
I want their fucking names.

24:32.844 --> 24:35.044
Okay. There's two of them.

24:35.046 --> 24:36.650
I don't know their names.

24:37.616 --> 24:41.051
But these guys,
they're fucking crazy.

24:41.053 --> 24:42.122
What do you mean?

24:45.190 --> 24:47.960
I mean, there's some dark
shit going on in this town.

24:49.362 --> 24:53.099
There's talks about these guys
that they're different from us.

24:54.667 --> 24:55.769
Different how?

24:57.803 --> 24:59.139
That they're not even human.

25:05.177 --> 25:08.946
Oh! Jesus. I'm telling
you straight, man.

25:08.948 --> 25:10.950
These guys are evil,
like cannibals.

25:12.151 --> 25:13.417
I don't believe in monsters!

25:13.419 --> 25:15.084
Jesus fucking Christ.

25:15.086 --> 25:16.887
Where do I find them?

25:16.889 --> 25:18.024
I... I don't know.

25:19.158 --> 25:20.994
- Where do I find them?
- Okay. Okay

25:22.694 --> 25:25.798
I'll tell you everything,
okay. Just stop.

25:27.132 --> 25:30.868
There's a collection tomorrow
night, okay, Eastside storage.

25:30.870 --> 25:33.102
Speak to the blind man,

25:33.104 --> 25:34.274
he sees everything.

25:41.913 --> 25:44.984
<i>The great
dragon was thrown down.</i>

25:47.687 --> 25:50.120
<i>That's ancient serpent,</i>

25:50.122 --> 25:54.190
<i>known as the devil or Satan,</i>

25:54.192 --> 25:56.762
<i>great deceiver of the world.</i>

25:57.796 --> 26:00.130
He was thrown down to the earth,

26:00.132 --> 26:03.068
and his angels were
thrown down with him.

26:09.775 --> 26:11.177
Why do I get the feeling

26:12.077 --> 26:14.410
with all the craziness
going on around here,

26:14.412 --> 26:16.115
it's not entirely what you see?

26:18.883 --> 26:21.320
We all have a shadow
side, young man.

26:22.254 --> 26:25.389
I sense yours is
quite a strong one.

26:25.391 --> 26:27.694
If only you could see it.

26:33.332 --> 26:34.367
What do you see?

26:37.202 --> 26:40.806
There's a fine line
between good and evil.

26:42.274 --> 26:47.046
Sometimes you've got to do a
little bad for the greater good

26:53.219 --> 26:55.455
I see destiny.

27:07.232 --> 27:09.001
I don't believe in destiny.

27:11.437 --> 27:13.039
Take care, old man.

27:15.407 --> 27:16.710
But you will.

27:17.776 --> 27:20.043
Oh, you will.

29:07.952 --> 29:09.588
How did
you get this lead?

29:11.422 --> 29:13.058
You really want to know?

29:15.427 --> 29:17.964
See, that's what the
fuck I'm talking about.

29:19.097 --> 29:20.397
You going off the rails,

29:20.399 --> 29:22.498
playing fucking vigilante.

29:22.500 --> 29:25.002
You're going to get us
both in trouble, man.

29:25.004 --> 29:26.906
Don't think I don't
know what you're doing.

29:34.613 --> 29:36.248
Did he deserve it at least?

29:37.315 --> 29:39.549
Let's say I left my mark.

29:39.551 --> 29:40.587
Oh, good.

29:45.223 --> 29:47.092
What are we doing here?

29:47.992 --> 29:49.361
What are we looking for?

29:53.164 --> 29:55.100
Hey, Frank, let me
ask you something.

29:57.670 --> 30:02.141
You ever heard of the
occult out here in LA?

30:04.008 --> 30:05.644
You mean like devil worship?

30:06.946 --> 30:07.947
No.

30:11.150 --> 30:12.285
Something different.

30:13.485 --> 30:16.055
No. Can't say that I have.

30:17.690 --> 30:19.025
You okay?

30:29.034 --> 30:30.003
That's it.

30:31.036 --> 30:32.238
There it is.

30:36.475 --> 30:38.274
What the fuck.

30:38.276 --> 30:39.312
Let's go.

30:44.516 --> 30:46.149
Hey! Police!

30:46.151 --> 30:47.684
Get out the fucking car!

30:47.686 --> 30:50.123
Freeze! Put the
fucking body down.

30:51.422 --> 30:54.026
I said put that fucking
body down real slow.

30:56.295 --> 30:57.596
Get out the fucking car!

31:00.399 --> 31:03.268
I said get out the fucking car.
Hands where I can see them.

31:22.621 --> 31:26.392
Oh my, that's a big gun.

31:27.426 --> 31:28.494
Quiet, bitch.

31:29.628 --> 31:32.298
Ooh, are you a cop?

31:36.367 --> 31:38.101
Don't you come any closer.

31:38.103 --> 31:40.704
I swear to God I'll put
a fucking bullet in you.

31:40.706 --> 31:42.738
I know what you are.

31:42.740 --> 31:43.709
Well, tell me,

31:45.777 --> 31:47.212
what am I?

31:48.514 --> 31:50.112
You're fucking cannibals.

31:53.751 --> 31:56.285
Don't fucking move.
Put the fucking body down.

31:56.287 --> 31:57.353
- Frank!
- Corbin!

31:57.355 --> 31:59.422
I'm going to shoot this asshole.

31:59.424 --> 32:00.292
It's a nice ring.

32:03.295 --> 32:06.164
I like this one. He's feisty.

32:08.132 --> 32:11.400
Turn around real fucking slow.

32:11.402 --> 32:14.737
This is my favorite part.

32:14.739 --> 32:16.672
Hey!

32:16.674 --> 32:17.642
Boo!

33:48.366 --> 33:50.266
<i>No! No, please!</i>

33:50.268 --> 33:52.171
Jesus fucking Christ.

35:19.790 --> 35:20.759
Fuck.

35:23.495 --> 35:24.594
Fuck!

35:24.596 --> 35:27.029
Hey! Hey!

35:27.031 --> 35:29.632
Let me the fuck out of here!

35:32.303 --> 35:34.638
I said let me the
fuck out of here!

35:34.640 --> 35:36.875
<i>Shut the fuck up!
He will come back.</i>

35:38.477 --> 35:39.676
Shout all you want.

35:39.678 --> 35:40.980
Fuck!

35:41.980 --> 35:43.683
Not going to change anything.

35:45.017 --> 35:46.252
<i>Fucking bastard.</i>

35:46.951 --> 35:48.520
Just go easy, kid.

35:50.656 --> 35:52.458
You could be here for a while.

35:59.665 --> 36:02.368
What is this place?
Where are we?

36:04.803 --> 36:05.805
Nowhere.

36:08.372 --> 36:09.908
Somebody must know a way.

36:13.078 --> 36:14.814
You remember how you got here?

36:16.948 --> 36:18.517
How long you've been here?

36:20.785 --> 36:21.853
Doesn't matter.

36:24.323 --> 36:25.958
<i>To the outside world,</i>

36:26.892 --> 36:28.460
<i>we've all disappeared.</i>

36:30.529 --> 36:31.897
Jesus Christ.

36:34.665 --> 36:35.968
Ghosts, kid.

36:41.906 --> 36:43.542
What's going on?

36:45.109 --> 36:46.511
They are coming.

37:16.006 --> 37:17.442
Jesus.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.967
Corbin, what the hell?

38:43.761 --> 38:45.527
You sick fucks.

38:47.098 --> 38:49.502
Come on, Corbin,
talk to me, man.

39:27.872 --> 39:29.007
Come on, motherfucker!

39:49.995 --> 39:51.096
Son of a bitch.

39:58.169 --> 39:59.902
Fuck you!

39:59.904 --> 40:01.971
<i>Shut the fuck up, man.</i>

40:01.973 --> 40:04.243
You better save
your strength for it.

40:06.944 --> 40:07.979
Eat.

40:09.114 --> 40:11.080
I don't want your food.

40:11.082 --> 40:13.919
If you're going to sit there and
die like a dog, you go ahead.

40:15.986 --> 40:17.689
Oh, hey your friend.

40:19.189 --> 40:20.859
But that was your first fight.

40:22.093 --> 40:23.728
And it's not going
to be your last.

40:24.663 --> 40:25.865
Eat.

40:31.770 --> 40:33.835
What if you don't fight?

40:33.837 --> 40:34.873
You're dead.

40:36.341 --> 40:37.810
What if you lose?

40:39.343 --> 40:40.645
If you lose,

40:41.913 --> 40:45.714
let's just say you don't have
to worry about the cage anymore.

40:45.716 --> 40:47.018
<i>Help!</i>

40:51.823 --> 40:53.625
I know what you're thinking.

40:55.960 --> 40:57.796
You're asking
yourself why go on.

41:03.033 --> 41:04.903
They killed
my little boy.

41:10.841 --> 41:13.311
But they spared my wife,

41:14.913 --> 41:16.748
and she's here somewhere.

41:17.982 --> 41:19.584
You think she's still alive?

41:20.752 --> 41:21.921
If she is...

41:23.288 --> 41:25.120
she'll pray for death.

41:25.122 --> 41:26.825
Shut your mouth.

41:28.660 --> 41:30.629
We're just playthings to them.

41:32.297 --> 41:35.665
To who? What are
you talking about?

41:35.667 --> 41:37.002
She's lying.

41:38.136 --> 41:39.201
I know her.

41:41.272 --> 41:44.107
I can still hear their screams.

41:44.109 --> 41:46.141
You've seen nothing.

41:46.143 --> 41:47.710
You're just scared.

41:47.712 --> 41:49.245
I don't understand.

41:49.247 --> 41:50.616
What's it to you, man?

41:52.283 --> 41:53.719
I'm a cop.

41:55.754 --> 41:57.323
I've been trying
to find these people.

41:58.256 --> 41:59.892
Have they found anybody?

42:03.160 --> 42:04.127
No.

42:04.129 --> 42:05.598
Good job, asshole.

42:06.330 --> 42:08.633
Useless fucking pig!

42:13.805 --> 42:15.737
What did you see?

42:15.739 --> 42:16.908
Where are the others?

42:18.209 --> 42:19.944
They're just using us.

42:21.413 --> 42:22.781
Using us for what?

42:27.218 --> 42:28.187
Food.

43:05.857 --> 43:06.725
No.

43:08.058 --> 43:09.361
I'm already dead.

43:13.031 --> 43:15.797
No!

43:15.799 --> 43:16.966
No!

43:19.738 --> 43:21.804
<i>The missing people
continues to grow</i>

43:21.806 --> 43:23.138
<i>in the Los Angeles area,</i>

43:23.140 --> 43:25.208
<i>LAPD detective Corbin Nash,</i>

43:25.210 --> 43:28.180
<i>who was said to be working
the case is now reported...</i>

43:33.317 --> 43:34.852
You killed her.

43:38.022 --> 43:40.025
I'm going to fucking kill you.

43:58.009 --> 43:59.808
You're early don't
you think, Frank?

43:59.810 --> 44:02.411
I'm not here for
a fucking dance

44:02.413 --> 44:03.782
Corbin is gone.

44:09.788 --> 44:10.856
Ring any bells?

44:13.357 --> 44:16.227
Now I know why Corbin kept
coming to this shithole.

44:17.395 --> 44:21.096
Three girls, six months,

44:21.098 --> 44:23.067
all dancers right here.

44:25.435 --> 44:26.701
Start fucking talking.

44:26.703 --> 44:29.471
Look, I can't help you, Frank,
okay. There is nothing I can do.

44:29.473 --> 44:31.339
No, I don't got
time for bullshit.

44:31.341 --> 44:33.475
I'll drag you down to
the station right now.

44:33.477 --> 44:35.076
Frank, you need to
listen to me, okay?

44:35.078 --> 44:36.045
Two guys.

44:36.047 --> 44:38.580
One's a mean-looking
bastard all in black.

44:38.582 --> 44:39.815
The other one is...

44:39.817 --> 44:42.821
You know, I don't know what
the fuck it was but it did this.

44:44.556 --> 44:47.025
Corbin mentioned
something about the occult.

44:48.526 --> 44:51.527
I've seen the bodies, Darius.

44:51.529 --> 44:53.866
I know you know who
I'm talking about.

44:55.866 --> 44:57.401
Just tell me where to find them.

44:59.603 --> 45:01.038
You don't find them.

45:02.973 --> 45:04.176
They find you.

45:20.091 --> 45:21.527
Happy anniversary.

45:28.098 --> 45:29.066
Tell me,

45:30.301 --> 45:31.870
how old am I again?

45:33.303 --> 45:34.539
Thirty-two.

45:37.174 --> 45:40.042
How old am I really?

45:40.044 --> 45:42.044
You'd be seventy-three, darling.

45:42.046 --> 45:43.181
Ah!

45:44.114 --> 45:46.017
Like magic.

45:49.486 --> 45:51.022
Tell me Vince,

45:53.457 --> 45:56.093
all those women
that you killed before,

45:58.428 --> 46:01.098
did you really just murder them?

46:02.065 --> 46:03.632
Yes.

46:03.634 --> 46:05.370
That's all they deserved.

46:07.004 --> 46:09.207
And you didn't fuck any of them?

46:11.075 --> 46:12.343
None of them.

46:15.946 --> 46:17.548
Uh-huh.

46:19.317 --> 46:21.553
I need to know that I'm special.

46:23.553 --> 46:24.889
You are.

46:27.491 --> 46:29.926
That's nice, dear.

46:46.977 --> 46:50.381
Your first kill, it changed you.

46:51.683 --> 46:53.051
It made me.

46:56.053 --> 46:58.022
My mother was a whore.

47:00.959 --> 47:03.227
What made me so special?

47:06.564 --> 47:09.431
Because I just knew when
I looked into your eyes,

47:09.433 --> 47:11.102
I was saved.

47:13.337 --> 47:15.073
<i>You're my angel.</i>

47:22.113 --> 47:23.547
They abandoned me.

47:25.582 --> 47:27.318
They didn't deserve you.

47:28.752 --> 47:32.355
My own parents, Vince.

47:32.357 --> 47:33.525
I know, baby.

47:35.692 --> 47:37.261
They killed me.

47:41.098 --> 47:42.366
<i>But you...</i>

47:43.701 --> 47:45.337
<i>...you saved me.</i>

47:48.306 --> 47:50.609
<i>And it changed me forever.</i>

47:57.114 --> 47:58.283
<i>Forever.</i>

48:03.286 --> 48:05.154
Mm...

48:08.225 --> 48:09.527
Fuck.

48:16.433 --> 48:18.236
You look like my mother.

48:42.794 --> 48:44.596
Ah!

49:08.152 --> 49:09.654
Argh!

49:11.321 --> 49:12.757
Oh!

49:41.852 --> 49:44.188
I told you I was going
to fucking kill you.

49:47.825 --> 49:49.060
Argh!

49:54.765 --> 49:56.401
He roughed you up pretty good.

49:59.402 --> 50:00.571
He had it coming.

50:02.506 --> 50:03.575
He did.

50:11.381 --> 50:13.150
This place doesn't
make any sense.

50:16.254 --> 50:17.288
What do you mean?

50:20.290 --> 50:21.660
Doesn't feel criminal.

50:23.460 --> 50:25.229
Feels like something else.

50:27.931 --> 50:29.267
Like what?

50:31.768 --> 50:34.502
Something impossible.

50:34.504 --> 50:35.673
Who took you?

50:37.507 --> 50:38.743
Were there two of them?

50:41.411 --> 50:42.747
That's what I thought.

50:45.248 --> 50:46.852
The one that killed my boy,

50:47.817 --> 50:49.417
he looked like a woman

50:49.419 --> 50:51.687
but there's no way
in hell it was.

50:51.689 --> 50:53.788
He's stronger than a damn mule.

50:53.790 --> 50:55.257
You fought them?

50:55.259 --> 50:56.728
Fucking tried.

50:59.663 --> 51:02.198
But I couldn't get near them.

51:02.200 --> 51:03.902
And when I did,
it didn't matter.

51:06.671 --> 51:08.672
The other guy,
he made me watch

51:13.477 --> 51:15.247
<i>as they killed our boy.</i>

51:17.747 --> 51:18.749
You're right,

51:21.819 --> 51:23.555
it isn't criminal.

51:27.692 --> 51:29.394
It's pure evil.

51:36.767 --> 51:40.404
I was told my parents
were taken, murdered.

51:44.375 --> 51:45.810
I didn't believe it at first.

51:50.647 --> 51:52.450
I was given a name.

51:54.384 --> 51:55.252
Who?

51:56.754 --> 51:58.020
Drake.

52:15.339 --> 52:17.906
Ah! Fuck!

52:19.743 --> 52:20.844
<i>You're not afraid.</i>

52:22.980 --> 52:24.482
The dark room doesn't scare me.

52:25.549 --> 52:27.585
<i>Does it pleasure
you then, maybe?</i>

52:29.453 --> 52:30.386
What?

52:30.388 --> 52:34.455
<i>The darkness,
its flames engulf you.</i>

52:34.457 --> 52:37.428
<i>Yet, you failed to see this.</i>

52:41.631 --> 52:43.598
Who are you?

52:43.600 --> 52:46.537
<i>The one that dwells
amongst the darkest of souls.</i>

52:51.709 --> 52:53.442
Fuck you!

52:53.444 --> 52:55.380
If you are so bad,
then why are you hiding?

52:56.846 --> 53:00.882
<i>My sin is different to yours.</i>

53:00.884 --> 53:03.886
<i>Its origin is not of your world.</i>

53:03.888 --> 53:06.754
<i>If you fall far enough,</i>

53:06.756 --> 53:08.559
<i>you will see me.</i>

53:35.453 --> 53:38.023
<i>Okay. Open this one next.</i>

53:58.109 --> 54:00.011
<i>Merry Christmas, Zach.</i>

54:30.975 --> 54:32.944
<i>Born into darkness,</i>

54:36.080 --> 54:39.718
<i>these men turned to
walk down dark paths.</i>

54:42.953 --> 54:45.090
<i>They take pleasure
in doing wrong.</i>

54:48.459 --> 54:51.763
<i>And they enjoy the
twisted ways of evil.</i>

55:14.919 --> 55:18.857
Ooh. What's shaking, pops?

55:20.790 --> 55:23.859
Why don't you just
leave me alone?

55:23.861 --> 55:28.065
Because I just don't understand
why you must live this lie.

55:29.098 --> 55:31.567
I like the sun on my face.

55:31.569 --> 55:32.935
That's enough for me.

55:32.937 --> 55:35.607
Well, I don't miss
seeing the sun.

55:36.573 --> 55:38.142
They're all a joke.

55:39.076 --> 55:41.810
I embrace the darkness.

55:41.812 --> 55:43.712
So fuck them and the day.

55:43.714 --> 55:45.549
We own this world.

55:46.850 --> 55:49.183
The Lord preserves
all that love Him

55:49.185 --> 55:52.587
and all the wicked
he will destroy.

55:52.589 --> 55:56.928
Thy throat is an open coffin.

55:58.928 --> 56:00.728
The tongue

56:00.730 --> 56:03.667
is used as a weapon to deceive.

56:04.701 --> 56:06.571
Blood of asps

56:07.638 --> 56:09.140
falls through your lips.

56:11.908 --> 56:14.011
I have accepted my fate.

56:15.212 --> 56:17.047
You abandoned the nights!

56:19.950 --> 56:21.949
Maybe you're right.

56:21.951 --> 56:24.520
But I'm not the one
who's blind here.

56:24.522 --> 56:26.087
You just don't see it, do you?

56:26.089 --> 56:28.459
See what, old man?

56:29.792 --> 56:31.528
Your time will come.

56:34.064 --> 56:36.968
He will destroy them
and their evil ways.

56:37.868 --> 56:38.866
He?

56:40.671 --> 56:44.007
He abandoned me a long time ago.

56:46.609 --> 56:47.845
But you know what?

56:48.946 --> 56:51.946
You fell from his grace.

56:51.948 --> 56:53.047
And now,

56:53.049 --> 56:56.687
you've got to rot down
here with the rest of them.

57:09.832 --> 57:10.968
Uh!

57:47.770 --> 57:48.872
Move.

57:56.312 --> 57:58.245
I said move.

57:58.247 --> 57:59.983
Bro, fuck off.

58:27.310 --> 58:28.645
Ah.

58:35.785 --> 58:36.820
Oh.

58:45.228 --> 58:46.330
Come here.

59:04.314 --> 59:06.384
I know she's
fucking that guy.

59:09.252 --> 59:11.319
She thinks I was
a fucking idiot.

59:11.321 --> 59:13.721
Think I'm fucking stupid.

59:13.723 --> 59:15.123
Fuck.

59:15.125 --> 59:17.192
Oh, gosh, you're beautiful.

59:20.163 --> 59:21.765
Fucking Nash.

59:22.466 --> 59:23.332
Fucking Nash.

59:23.334 --> 59:25.736
What the fuck kind
of name is that? Ah!

59:26.904 --> 59:29.270
What the fuck did you just say?

59:33.877 --> 59:36.844
He's still alive.

59:36.846 --> 59:38.348
You should have burned him.

59:39.348 --> 59:42.419
Fuck, Drake.
And fuck the monarchy.

59:43.821 --> 59:45.957
I'll deal with this myself.

01:00:28.364 --> 01:00:30.301
Please, God,

01:00:32.902 --> 01:00:35.837
send him an angel of light,

01:00:35.839 --> 01:00:37.475
<i>protect him
from darkness.</i>

01:01:00.297 --> 01:01:03.464
Let me go. Let me go.

01:01:03.466 --> 01:01:05.169
Let me go.

01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:07.305
Let me go.

01:01:49.312 --> 01:01:52.249
<i>We're dying.</i>

01:02:31.654 --> 01:02:32.589
No.

01:02:34.223 --> 01:02:35.325
No.

01:02:39.596 --> 01:02:41.265
I ain't fucking doing this.

01:02:45.067 --> 01:02:46.437
You got no choice, kid.

01:02:49.105 --> 01:02:50.308
Neither do I.

01:02:53.542 --> 01:02:55.046
Let's get this over with.

01:03:25.308 --> 01:03:26.243
Fight.

01:03:33.549 --> 01:03:36.353
Stop it. Stop it.

01:03:37.421 --> 01:03:39.022
Argh!

01:03:57.640 --> 01:03:58.608
Fight.

01:04:00.643 --> 01:04:02.046
I'm going to kill you.

01:04:03.547 --> 01:04:05.082
Ah!

01:04:13.457 --> 01:04:14.525
I'm going to kill you, kid.

01:04:16.058 --> 01:04:17.227
I'm going to kill you.

01:04:49.158 --> 01:04:50.493
Just fucking do it.

01:04:56.132 --> 01:04:57.535
I will see my boy.

01:05:02.806 --> 01:05:04.608
I'm sorry.

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:09.212
I can't do it.

01:05:14.216 --> 01:05:15.352
No more!

01:05:17.319 --> 01:05:19.054
Uh!

01:05:19.056 --> 01:05:20.288
Argh!

01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:21.656
No! Let him go!

01:05:31.768 --> 01:05:34.438
Drake!

01:05:36.239 --> 01:05:39.510
Drake!

01:05:59.261 --> 01:06:00.765
<i>You look like him,</i>

01:06:04.301 --> 01:06:06.036
<i>his shadow perhaps.</i>

01:06:08.404 --> 01:06:10.105
You killed my parents.

01:06:12.241 --> 01:06:14.141
<i>I ate them.</i>

01:06:14.143 --> 01:06:15.645
<i>But do not be troubled,</i>

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.812
<i>as I too lost
somebody dear to me</i>

01:06:18.814 --> 01:06:22.417
<i>at the hand of your
murderous parents.</i>

01:06:22.419 --> 01:06:23.319
Murderous?

01:06:24.488 --> 01:06:27.158
What do you call all
this, you sick fuck?

01:06:29.125 --> 01:06:30.393
<i>Evolution.</i>

01:06:32.529 --> 01:06:35.196
I'm glad my parents killed
your fucking brother.

01:06:35.198 --> 01:06:37.401
<i>Your existence is a joke.</i>

01:06:38.401 --> 01:06:40.638
<i>It's as if you were
created to fall.</i>

01:06:41.705 --> 01:06:44.138
I'm still standing.

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:47.241
<i>Your pathetic soul wanders
aimlessly through an existence</i>

01:06:47.243 --> 01:06:50.678
<i>that fails everything
you are not.</i>

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:51.781
Which is what?

01:06:54.151 --> 01:06:55.118
<i>Us.</i>

01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:04.428
<i>Many hunters hide
their offspring.</i>

01:07:06.428 --> 01:07:08.929
<i>When I threw your parents apart,</i>

01:07:08.931 --> 01:07:11.502
<i>I sensed something,</i>

01:07:12.801 --> 01:07:14.669
<i>but not you.</i>

01:07:14.671 --> 01:07:17.471
<i>You don't carry their strength.</i>

01:07:17.473 --> 01:07:19.440
<i>Unlike them,</i>

01:07:19.442 --> 01:07:22.546
<i>you are not worthy
to die by my hands.</i>

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.582
<i>You'll be left to
rot in the streets.</i>

01:07:27.584 --> 01:07:31.821
<i>The Nash legacy ends with you.</i>

01:07:32.888 --> 01:07:34.755
Come fucking get it.

01:07:37.493 --> 01:07:39.426
You better fucking kill me.

01:07:43.767 --> 01:07:45.402
Argh!

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:31.549
Something's happening.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.627
Don't!

01:08:46.496 --> 01:08:47.861
Don't.

01:09:01.944 --> 01:09:04.915
Please father, kill me.

01:09:06.616 --> 01:09:07.917
Please kill me.

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:38.935
That fuck is in there, man.

01:11:44.206 --> 01:11:46.109
He's mine.

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.115
Not with Macy, right?

01:11:54.117 --> 01:11:56.687
Shh. I smell something.

01:12:01.457 --> 01:12:03.057
Macy, babe!

01:12:03.059 --> 01:12:03.994
Shh!

01:12:20.710 --> 01:12:22.112
He's done.

01:12:41.965 --> 01:12:46.267
You think you can fuck my girl

01:12:46.269 --> 01:12:48.768
and live, cocksucker?

01:12:48.770 --> 01:12:49.870
Uhm?

01:13:01.818 --> 01:13:03.487
Small world.

01:13:11.961 --> 01:13:14.794
Nobody fuck with my girl.

01:13:14.796 --> 01:13:17.832
We can't make the
same mistake twice.

01:13:17.834 --> 01:13:18.836
We should burn him.

01:13:19.935 --> 01:13:21.701
You understand?

01:13:21.703 --> 01:13:23.169
Nobody...

01:13:23.171 --> 01:13:25.272
Ah!

01:13:45.894 --> 01:13:47.230
You said he was dead.

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.067
How do we find him now?

01:13:54.069 --> 01:13:55.839
He'll find us.

01:14:16.858 --> 01:14:18.194
Hello.

01:14:21.863 --> 01:14:24.231
Honey, come out.

01:14:24.233 --> 01:14:27.602
I'm going to treat you
like a real boyfriend.

01:14:29.605 --> 01:14:31.108
Ha, ha, ha.

01:14:34.676 --> 01:14:36.910
Hello, sweetheart.

01:14:40.683 --> 01:14:43.086
Are you going to
come out to play?

01:14:45.921 --> 01:14:47.757
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

01:14:48.791 --> 01:14:50.391
And I don't like to wait!

01:14:52.127 --> 01:14:54.027
Tick-tock.

01:14:54.029 --> 01:14:55.896
Tick-tock.

01:14:55.898 --> 01:14:57.935
His time is running out.

01:15:03.872 --> 01:15:05.271
Come on!

01:16:09.371 --> 01:16:12.142
Destiny caught up
with you after all.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.453
Frank.

01:16:25.455 --> 01:16:26.689
Corbin?

01:16:27.756 --> 01:16:29.789
What the fuck happened to you?

01:16:29.791 --> 01:16:32.258
Everybody thinks you're dead.

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:34.195
Where are they?

01:16:34.197 --> 01:16:38.835
The question you should
be asking is who are they.

01:16:40.303 --> 01:16:43.137
They are the founders
of civilizations,

01:16:43.139 --> 01:16:45.375
the architects of
historical movement.

01:16:46.408 --> 01:16:48.077
They are monsters.

01:16:49.412 --> 01:16:51.048
I'm going after them.

01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:56.186
- Let me help you.
- No.

01:16:57.252 --> 01:17:00.056
You got family.
Too much to lose.

01:17:00.989 --> 01:17:01.858
I don't.

01:17:10.332 --> 01:17:12.133
They're everywhere.

01:17:12.135 --> 01:17:16.536
They've been everywhere
since the dawn of time.

01:17:16.538 --> 01:17:18.241
And the two I'm looking for?

01:17:19.908 --> 01:17:21.875
<i>The two you seek,</i>

01:17:21.877 --> 01:17:23.979
they not only
embrace their gift,

01:17:25.281 --> 01:17:27.017
they revel in it.

01:17:30.787 --> 01:17:33.890
<i>They work as
collectors in what they call...</i>

01:17:36.024 --> 01:17:38.526
<i>the meat trade.</i>

01:17:38.528 --> 01:17:42.495
<i>They use some for sport,
fighting humans like dogs.</i>

01:17:45.535 --> 01:17:46.970
<i>Others...</i>

01:17:48.504 --> 01:17:50.407
<i>they harvest their blood,</i>

01:17:51.974 --> 01:17:54.911
<i>storing them as a food source.</i>

01:17:57.446 --> 01:18:00.847
They can walk amongst
us in daylight.

01:18:00.849 --> 01:18:03.217
They are weak, fragile,

01:18:03.219 --> 01:18:05.055
as blind as I.

01:18:06.889 --> 01:18:09.392
<i>Their bond was made in life.</i>

01:18:12.929 --> 01:18:15.398
<i>It only superseded in death.</i>

01:18:17.834 --> 01:18:21.203
<i>These demons are
old fashioned as hell.</i>

01:18:23.572 --> 01:18:25.441
I'm all ready for
the game, Frank.

01:18:26.442 --> 01:18:27.310
Game?

01:18:28.443 --> 01:18:29.946
What game?

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:34.017
The only real game
left worth playing.

01:18:35.084 --> 01:18:36.318
How do I kill them?

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.924
A stake through the
heart should do nicely.

01:18:49.599 --> 01:18:51.201
<i>Now I know, old man.</i>

01:18:52.468 --> 01:18:53.870
Rest easy.

01:18:57.372 --> 01:18:59.106
I'm going to kill them all.

01:21:18.781 --> 01:21:20.450
Ooh.

01:21:29.125 --> 01:21:32.325
I am so impressed.

01:21:32.327 --> 01:21:34.397
You actually made it.

01:21:35.764 --> 01:21:36.565
Vince, honey,

01:21:37.767 --> 01:21:41.638
be a doll and go get
our guest a drink.

01:21:46.375 --> 01:21:49.142
You look so hot.

01:21:49.144 --> 01:21:51.110
Oh, my goodness.

01:21:51.112 --> 01:21:51.981
Where is she?

01:21:53.049 --> 01:21:55.082
Mmm.

01:21:55.084 --> 01:21:57.484
I said where is she?

01:21:57.486 --> 01:22:00.456
Shhh. You'll wake my babies!

01:22:18.674 --> 01:22:22.109
Now, why don't you
just have a seat?

01:22:22.111 --> 01:22:23.276
Fuck you.

01:22:23.278 --> 01:22:24.613
You're fucking insane.

01:22:27.082 --> 01:22:30.420
You are so fascinating.

01:22:33.555 --> 01:22:35.556
I mean, after all,

01:22:35.558 --> 01:22:38.859
you should be dead.

01:22:38.861 --> 01:22:40.330
I am dead.

01:22:41.863 --> 01:22:45.067
You've only just begun.

01:22:46.102 --> 01:22:47.537
You know why I'm here.

01:22:50.438 --> 01:22:53.042
Well, I thought it was
because you wanted me.

01:22:56.444 --> 01:23:00.681
Do you think I'm beautiful?

01:23:00.683 --> 01:23:02.519
I'm here for the girl.

01:23:04.319 --> 01:23:05.654
And then I'm going to kill you.

01:23:10.826 --> 01:23:11.828
And you.

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:20.734
That is no way
to talk to a lady.

01:23:20.736 --> 01:23:23.706
Ain't no lady here.
You're a freak.

01:23:24.806 --> 01:23:26.276
A freak?

01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:30.613
I'd rather be a
freak than a whore.

01:23:50.398 --> 01:23:52.734
She was begging for you.

01:23:58.306 --> 01:24:00.609
I can smell the
whore in that one.

01:24:42.384 --> 01:24:44.420
Ah!

01:25:00.603 --> 01:25:03.402
Ah!

01:25:08.010 --> 01:25:09.479
Oh, Corbin, watch out!

01:25:23.925 --> 01:25:25.394
Ah!

01:25:50.885 --> 01:25:53.223
Argh!

01:25:53.956 --> 01:25:57.790
Your kind fucked up when
they made me what I am.

01:26:00.528 --> 01:26:02.361
You should have made sure.

01:26:05.901 --> 01:26:07.433
No!

01:26:07.435 --> 01:26:08.403
No.

01:26:09.705 --> 01:26:11.474
Don't you fucking leave me.

01:26:16.745 --> 01:26:19.015
Tell me I'm beautiful.

01:26:22.584 --> 01:26:24.354
You're beautiful, baby girl.

01:26:26.087 --> 01:26:27.724
Tell me you love me.

01:26:31.693 --> 01:26:33.362
I've always loved you.

01:26:36.064 --> 01:26:39.368
Then go kill that
motherfucker for me.

01:26:43.738 --> 01:26:44.973
Ah.

01:27:37.158 --> 01:27:38.424
Oh...

01:28:09.957 --> 01:28:11.126
He's safe.

01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:15.997
What does he say?

01:28:18.434 --> 01:28:20.103
He says thank you.

01:28:24.072 --> 01:28:25.074
Thank you.

01:28:59.841 --> 01:29:00.742
Loss.

01:29:02.243 --> 01:29:04.880
That's the hardest part
about being human.

01:29:07.582 --> 01:29:11.487
Eventually in time,
we learn how to let go.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:14.890
But there's always hope, son.

01:29:16.791 --> 01:29:18.059
Always hope.

01:29:19.495 --> 01:29:24.032
It's in the darkness we're
able to find ourselves.

01:29:26.033 --> 01:29:27.836
I can't save them all.

01:29:32.974 --> 01:29:34.876
A lot of people
are going to die.

01:29:48.223 --> 01:29:49.826
But I'm going to try.

01:29:56.998 --> 01:29:58.765
And so it begins.

01:29:58.767 --> 01:30:03.072
So it begins.

01:30:13.581 --> 01:30:15.315
<i>Behold,</i>

01:30:15.317 --> 01:30:19.785
<i>for an angel fell like
lightning from the heavens,</i>

01:30:19.787 --> 01:30:22.157
<i>sent to us from God himself.</i>

01:30:24.158 --> 01:30:27.093
<i>For now our Lord will
send his vengeance,</i>

01:30:29.230 --> 01:30:31.501
<i>disguise my sin,</i>

01:30:34.803 --> 01:30:37.670
<i>to fight fire with fire</i>

01:30:40.075 --> 01:30:42.812
<i>for even the demons
will believe and shudder.</i>

01:30:44.912 --> 01:30:47.148
<i>He is their final judgment.</i>

01:30:48.183 --> 01:30:51.120
<i>He is the end.</i>
