Klaus: I assume I have the misfortune

00:03.305 --> 00:04.342
of speaking to my mother.

00:04.905 --> 00:06.218
I have come to heal our family.

00:06.220 --> 00:08.288
I will undo everything that has been done,

00:08.290 --> 00:11.021
thereby giving you a new life.

00:11.090 --> 00:12.559
I don't believe I've had the pleasure.

00:12.561 --> 00:14.133
You mean you don't recognize me?

00:14.135 --> 00:16.109
It's been a long time, finn.

00:16.111 --> 00:17.682
Cami: I have to get back to campus.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.019
I'm meeting my new advisor.

00:19.021 --> 00:20.523
- Mr. Griffith?
- Call me Vincent.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.821
Elijah: Aiden, you and Oliver
escort the children.

00:22.821 --> 00:24.755
We'll handle the rest.

00:26.692 --> 00:28.727
Elijah: Uh! Ugh!

00:28.729 --> 00:30.196
No more.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.130
Lenore: Oh, I'm afraid we've just begun.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.365
What is it, hayley?

00:32.366 --> 00:34.002
Something has happened to Elijah.

00:34.004 --> 00:35.172
He's vanished.

00:35.174 --> 00:36.575
Lenore: Stop fighting, Elijah.

00:36.577 --> 00:38.083
I want you to rejoin our family,

00:38.085 --> 00:39.589
take the body of a mortal.

00:39.591 --> 00:41.133
We can all be happy again.

00:41.135 --> 00:42.601
Get out of my head.

00:42.603 --> 00:47.281

01:22.180 --> 01:24.991
I've come to beg for your help.

01:24.993 --> 01:26.894
What for?

01:26.896 --> 01:28.029
You know I've always wanted

01:28.031 --> 01:29.165
children of my own.

01:29.167 --> 01:31.704
Then go. Have your viking children.

01:31.706 --> 01:34.180
It's been almost a full year,

01:34.182 --> 01:36.587

You come to me needing favors.

01:48.181 --> 01:50.385
If you hadn't abandoned
your talents with witchcraft,

01:50.387 --> 01:52.125
you could help yourself.

01:52.127 --> 01:53.529
I was never as strong as you.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.131
I know that just as I know

01:55.133 --> 01:57.067
you will not turn me away.

01:57.069 --> 01:58.837
You are my sister, and
whatever our quarrels,

01:58.839 --> 02:03.682
we are bound by blood.

02:05.289 --> 02:07.691
Please help me.

02:08.860 --> 02:12.769
What you ask of me,

02:12.771 --> 02:15.876
it requires a heavy sacrifice.

02:17.779 --> 02:20.217
I will do whatever you ask.

02:21.554 --> 02:23.559
Oh...

Spread the word from here to the bayou.

02:48.429 --> 02:49.897
Midnight tonight, he's to be put to death

02:49.899 --> 02:53.168
for his part in aiding
the escape of deserters.

02:53.170 --> 02:57.109
For now, chain him up in the lycee.

02:58.847 --> 03:00.815
Tell the other wolves to come
and have a look

03:00.817 --> 03:04.220
and see what happens to traitors.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.129
Well done.

03:09.131 --> 03:11.831
Now, I believe you have a meeting.

03:11.833 --> 03:14.768
Good. I'll tend to your brother.

03:36.501 --> 03:40.034
too willful to take my offer.

03:46.843 --> 03:49.846
I remember you as a little boy...

03:49.848 --> 03:52.853
Innocent, kind.

03:52.855 --> 03:55.924
If that boy had known the creature

03:55.926 --> 03:58.191
he would one day grow up to be,

03:58.193 --> 03:59.825
he'd have leapt into my arms

03:59.827 --> 04:02.359
and begged me to save him.

04:06.963 --> 04:09.197
I'd do anything for that little boy...

04:11.132 --> 04:13.700

are delicate creatures.

04:44.104 --> 04:46.169
No matter.

04:46.171 --> 04:49.670
As suspected, my mother has Elijah captive.

04:49.672 --> 04:51.371
Great. Let's go find them.

04:51.373 --> 04:53.206
Esther is too powerful.

04:53.208 --> 04:54.674
She won't easily be found.

04:54.676 --> 04:57.210
I need to draw her out.

04:57.212 --> 04:59.614
Wait. Where are you going?

04:59.616 --> 05:02.214
I'm going to change my shirt,

05:02.216 --> 05:04.416
and then I'm gonna find my brother.

05:04.418 --> 05:07.522
Klaus, let me come with you.

05:09.327 --> 05:11.230
I know you want to help, Hayley,

05:11.232 --> 05:12.599
but you can't.

05:12.601 --> 05:14.168
My mother is wretched.

05:14.170 --> 05:17.206
She will target you in order to thwart me,

05:17.208 --> 05:18.975
and I can't very well save Elijah

05:18.977 --> 05:24.148
if I'm busy saving you, can I?

Kept a low profile,

05:29.121 --> 05:30.587
went all over the city.

05:30.589 --> 05:32.054
There's no sign of Elijah anywhere.

05:32.056 --> 05:34.220
Yeah. The humans I know
said the same thing.

05:34.222 --> 05:36.923
Maybe Klaus is having better luck.

05:36.925 --> 05:39.091
Hayley: No. He's not, which sucks,

05:39.093 --> 05:41.859
considering how low the bar is around here.

05:41.861 --> 05:44.594
Hayley: Listen. You two
up for a rescue mission?

05:44.596 --> 05:46.263
Are we going after Elijah?

05:46.265 --> 05:47.632
Nope. That's all Klaus.

05:47.634 --> 05:48.965
I'm talking about Oliver.

05:48.967 --> 05:50.566
He and Elijah were fighting

05:50.568 --> 05:51.931
the werewolves together.

05:51.933 --> 05:53.165
I've heard that Oliver has been captured

05:53.167 --> 05:54.934
and he's about to be executed.

05:54.936 --> 05:57.903
Now, look. If we can save Oliver,

05:57.905 --> 05:59.303
then we might be able to find out

05:59.305 --> 06:00.437
where Elijah is.

06:00.439 --> 06:01.936
Ok. So what do you want from us?

06:01.938 --> 06:03.403
Just a little distraction.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.039
Esther's son finn, he's the one

06:05.041 --> 06:06.708
that's controlling the werewolves.

06:06.710 --> 06:08.378
If you can keep him out of the way,

06:08.380 --> 06:12.017
I can go get Ollie myself.

06:12.019 --> 06:14.217
Can't take on all those wolves by yourself.

06:14.219 --> 06:15.285
You'll get killed, and then I'll

06:15.287 --> 06:16.818
get killed for letting it happen.

06:16.820 --> 06:18.419
I'm not going in alone.

06:18.421 --> 06:19.985
The werewolves may be
answering to the witches,

06:19.987 --> 06:21.719
but they still have an Alpha.

06:21.721 --> 06:24.591
I just have to find him.

06:36.572 --> 06:38.971
Fancy seeing you here.

06:38.973 --> 06:42.641
Ha! Not that fancy, seeing as I work here.

06:42.643 --> 06:44.012
I thought I mentioned that.

06:44.014 --> 06:47.349

06:58.701 --> 07:00.969

07:00.971 --> 07:05.040
Yeah, actually. He has family in town.

07:05.042 --> 07:06.441
They don't really get along,

07:06.443 --> 07:07.776
and he's kind of flipping out.

07:07.778 --> 07:10.478
I got sucked into the crazy.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.647
Seems unfair that he would rely so heavily

07:12.649 --> 07:15.018
on you for support.

07:15.020 --> 07:17.322
Doesn't he have anyone else?

07:17.324 --> 07:19.221
His sister left town.

07:19.223 --> 07:22.255
His brother has been... Occupied.

Rest of his family I wouldn't
say has a healthy dynamic.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.027

07:26.029 --> 07:27.730
a professional obligation to help him.

Cami, this is a person
whom you've described

07:29.566 --> 07:31.364
as being dangerous.

07:31.366 --> 07:33.166

I'd say you were worried.

09:05.239 --> 09:07.639
What has she done to you?

09:07.641 --> 09:11.808
1,000 years of murder, mayhem,

09:11.810 --> 09:14.615
and mother believes she
can still save our souls.

[Glissando]

09:18.552 --> 09:21.386

09:43.348 --> 09:45.549

but not to worry.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.490
I'll return him to you.

09:50.492 --> 09:53.261
All I ask is that you hear me out.

09:53.263 --> 09:56.301
You expect me to sit through
a sermon of your lies?

09:56.303 --> 09:59.840
I have lied in the past, to my shame,

09:59.842 --> 10:03.176
but I'm going to tell you the truth.

10:03.178 --> 10:05.246
I'm in the process of making Elijah

10:05.248 --> 10:08.549
into the man he was meant to be,

10:08.551 --> 10:13.019
and I intend to do the same for you.

10:20.852 --> 10:24.252

10:24.254 --> 10:29.325
How sad, not to mention symbolic.

10:30.056 --> 10:31.722
After all, you never intended

10:31.724 --> 10:34.357
to build a true home here.

10:34.359 --> 10:37.026
Even as Hayley carried your child,

10:37.028 --> 10:39.895
as Rebekah and Elijah sought to defend you,

10:39.897 --> 10:41.498
your thoughts were focused only

10:41.500 --> 10:43.335
on your conquest of the quarter.

10:43.337 --> 10:45.805
Tell me, how did that go?

10:45.807 --> 10:49.077
I'm sorry. Is this some
sort of motherly critique?

10:49.079 --> 10:51.877
Please feel free to choke on it.

10:51.879 --> 10:54.379
I mention your failures

10:54.381 --> 10:56.748
only to make a point, my dear.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.284
You've endured several lifetimes of misery,

10:59.286 --> 11:01.389
never mind the suffering
you've caused others,

11:01.391 --> 11:03.225

11:27.894 --> 11:31.994
Your love was a curse,
an affect you feigned.

11:31.996 --> 11:34.464
The truth is, you're no better than Mikael,

11:34.466 --> 11:36.533
and like him, you seem to have crawled back

11:36.535 --> 11:41.503
from the grave simply
to ruin your own children.

12:28.345 --> 12:31.216
Long story short is... Impossible.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.685

12:32.687 --> 12:35.089
Vincent Griffith has no
other academic credentials,

and, according to my uncle Kieran's

12:36.526 --> 12:38.390

12:38.392 --> 12:40.628
Griffith is a family of witches.

Oh, it's worse that that.

12:56.182 --> 12:59.182
asking questions about Klaus
and ordered my favorite drink

12:59.184 --> 13:01.049
like he's been watching me.

13:01.051 --> 13:02.418
Why?

13:02.420 --> 13:04.222
Probably to get the scoop on Klaus,

13:04.224 --> 13:05.958
maybe to use you as bait for a trap.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.126
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

13:07.128 --> 13:08.528
Either way, you're done with that guy.

13:08.530 --> 13:11.199
No. I'm just getting started.

13:11.201 --> 13:13.069
If Mikael has returned,

13:13.071 --> 13:14.839
we will need to deal with him.

13:14.841 --> 13:18.445
Ho ho! We? Is that a joke?

13:18.447 --> 13:20.780
Am I to forego centuries of hatred

13:20.782 --> 13:23.284
for my evil mother in order to join her

13:23.286 --> 13:25.388
in besting the very demon

13:25.390 --> 13:27.424
she herself allowed to raise me?

13:27.426 --> 13:29.059
I am not evil, Niklaus.

13:29.061 --> 13:32.764
I am your salvation, and Mikael,

13:32.766 --> 13:35.804
he was not always a demon.

13:35.806 --> 13:40.645
Lenore: Long ago, he loved
his children with all his heart.

13:40.647 --> 13:43.050
He doted on your brother Finn,

13:43.052 --> 13:48.294
but it was our first-born Freya
who was the apple of his eye.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.764
Do you really think that
saccharine recollections

13:52.766 --> 13:57.170
of ancient history will
have any effect on me at all?

13:57.172 --> 13:59.440
What I think is that you have gone mad

13:59.442 --> 14:02.010
from centuries of hating your parents,

14:02.012 --> 14:05.849
but if you join me now,

14:05.851 --> 14:09.687
I can grant you peace...

14:12.824 --> 14:16.797
And should Mikael return
with the intent to harm you,

14:16.799 --> 14:21.135
I will strike him down myself.

14:26.009 --> 14:29.678
That's quite an offer,

14:29.680 --> 14:32.380
but, you know,

14:32.382 --> 14:34.715
I've never needed any help

14:34.717 --> 14:37.417
when it comes to killing parents.

14:39.123 --> 14:42.490
You reject me out of hatred,

14:42.492 --> 14:46.557
but I have something stronger.

14:46.559 --> 14:51.498
I have the truth about your father...

14:51.500 --> 14:55.435
Not Mikael, your real father.

15:25.794 --> 15:27.361
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that

15:40.774 --> 15:43.543
I see you met my friend Ansel.

15:43.545 --> 15:45.380
You know her?

15:45.382 --> 15:47.251
Yeah. Actually, I do.

15:49.021 --> 15:51.789
She was supposed to be my wife.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.187
Lenore: 1,000 years ago in a fit of rage,

16:05.189 --> 16:07.956
you wrapped your bare hands around my neck

16:07.958 --> 16:10.160
and squeezed until I died.

16:10.162 --> 16:12.499
Do you even remember why?

16:12.501 --> 16:14.635
Let's see.

16:14.637 --> 16:16.470
You turned us all into monsters.

16:16.472 --> 16:19.140
You cursed me, denied me
of my hybrid nature.

16:19.142 --> 16:20.810
You lied about my father.

16:20.812 --> 16:22.379
It's that one above all.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.486
You killed me because I kept you

16:24.488 --> 16:26.621
from ever knowing your true father.

16:26.623 --> 16:28.322
My hatred for you runs so deep,

16:28.324 --> 16:31.124
it's difficult to pinpoint its origin.

16:32.625 --> 16:37.295
Maybe I hate that I'm the
product of a whore's lechery.

16:37.325 --> 16:39.829
Watch your mouth.

16:39.831 --> 16:41.997
You would do well to remember

16:41.999 --> 16:44.198
that you are still my son.

16:44.200 --> 16:47.872
You judge me evil, yet it was your lust

16:47.874 --> 16:50.076
that made me what I am.

16:50.078 --> 16:51.781
Not once have I ever regretted

16:51.783 --> 16:53.420
the love I had for your father,

16:53.484 --> 16:55.417
and you have never known the truth

16:55.419 --> 16:57.785
of how that love came to be

16:57.787 --> 16:59.419
or what happened in the months

16:59.421 --> 17:02.187
after Mikael and I lost your sister Freya

17:02.189 --> 17:04.489
to the plague.

17:04.491 --> 17:07.189
There are no words for the loss of a child,

17:07.191 --> 17:10.894
as you well know.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.433
After Francesca Guerrera
took over the wolves,

17:13.435 --> 17:15.569
she offered me a moonlight ring

17:15.570 --> 17:17.972
as long as I'd call her Alpha.

17:17.973 --> 17:19.574
I declined.

17:19.576 --> 17:20.775
So a couple of her brothers dragged me

17:20.777 --> 17:22.743
out here and left me for dead.

17:22.746 --> 17:24.348
By the time I healed up,

17:24.351 --> 17:26.654
work had spread about what happened to you

17:26.656 --> 17:29.257
and to your baby.

17:29.259 --> 17:33.997
So I knew it was over,

17:33.999 --> 17:37.737
and I just drifted,

17:37.739 --> 17:40.370
and that's when I met Ansel.

17:40.372 --> 17:42.706
See, he's been teaching me the old ways,

17:42.708 --> 17:44.643
the traditions,

17:44.645 --> 17:46.547
what it means to be a wolf.

17:46.549 --> 17:50.217
You mean, by living out
in the ass end of nowhere?

17:50.219 --> 17:51.785
Hey, easy.

17:51.787 --> 17:53.419
Your kind makes him ornery.

17:53.421 --> 17:54.822
My kind?

17:54.824 --> 17:56.658
Jack, whatever you and
your friend think of me,

17:56.660 --> 17:58.629
my kind is the wolves.

17:58.631 --> 18:00.564
Even if they did pledge
allegiance to a witch,

18:00.566 --> 18:03.333
all that means is, they need an Alpha.

18:05.904 --> 18:09.880
All I need is one, too.

18:09.882 --> 18:12.849
Yeah. I heard about that.

18:12.851 --> 18:15.854
Thing is, Ollie betrayed me.

18:15.856 --> 18:17.523
He plotted with the Guerrera's.

18:17.525 --> 18:18.859
He spilled his own people's blood.

18:18.861 --> 18:20.429
He was trying to make up for that.

18:20.431 --> 18:23.603
It doesn't matter. Witches have him.

18:23.605 --> 18:28.437
He's dead, not that I care.

18:30.207 --> 18:32.777
You don't want to be the Alpha, fine.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.213
I'll save Ollie myself.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.380
You got a problem, old man?

18:37.382 --> 18:39.448
I have no love of vampires,

18:39.450 --> 18:40.750
but I will not allow a wolf

18:40.752 --> 18:43.053
to be killed by witches.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.923
At least someone is interested.

18:48.994 --> 18:53.962
After Freya died, Mikael was inconsolable.

18:53.964 --> 18:56.928
Compelled by his grief, we were forced

18:56.930 --> 19:00.700
to pack our things and set across the seas.

19:00.702 --> 19:04.975
Eventually, his despair
would drive us apart,

19:04.977 --> 19:09.480
and that's when I saw
him for the first time...

19:09.482 --> 19:11.116
Your father.

19:11.118 --> 19:13.287
I'd never seen a man like him,

19:13.289 --> 19:17.922
powerful yet wise but loved by his people,

19:17.924 --> 19:19.558
and... Because Mikael had chosen

19:19.560 --> 19:21.493
to leave me alone in his grief,

19:21.495 --> 19:23.828
shunning me from his life...

19:23.830 --> 19:27.429
I found myself drawn to another.

19:36.137 --> 19:38.671
Why did your adonis abandon his son?

19:38.673 --> 19:40.172
Why did he allow me to be raised

19:40.174 --> 19:42.507
by a monster who hated me?

19:42.509 --> 19:44.343
Why not claim me for himself,

19:44.345 --> 19:47.648
raise me among the wolves,

19:47.650 --> 19:49.384
or was he as ashamed of his bastard

19:49.386 --> 19:50.452
as you were?

19:50.454 --> 19:52.152
No, no, no. He loved you.

19:52.154 --> 19:54.588
It was I who forbade it.

I knew if Mikael had
learned of my infidelity,

he would've destroyed us in his rage.

year-old grudge match

the first time around, I could've uncovered

20:24.550 --> 20:26.450
Francesca Guerrera's secret, and the wolves

20:26.452 --> 20:27.818
would never have taken over the quarter,

20:27.820 --> 20:29.887
and Klaus' baby would still be alive.

25:35.658 --> 25:37.792
[Barking]

25:39.763 --> 25:41.663
Sorry. No time to be gentle.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.831
- Uh!
- Let's go.

25:44.833 --> 25:46.665
Ooh, ha ha!

25:46.667 --> 25:49.437
So how would you diagnose

25:49.439 --> 25:51.673
my friend Klaus, if I may ask?

25:51.675 --> 25:55.173
Well, he's clearly depressive,

25:55.175 --> 25:59.677
low self-esteem, paranoia, impulse control.

25:59.679 --> 26:01.013
Wouldn't you agree?

26:01.015 --> 26:02.515
A lot of it is beyond me,

26:02.517 --> 26:04.453
too much history I don't know,

26:04.455 --> 26:07.656
like all the stuff with his siblings.

26:09.325 --> 26:11.492
How do you manage it?

26:11.494 --> 26:13.395
I beg your pardon?

26:13.397 --> 26:15.065
In one of our first sessions, you mentioned

26:15.067 --> 26:16.367
that you don't get along very well

26:16.369 --> 26:18.338
with your brothers.

26:18.340 --> 26:22.941
Do you stay in touch with them?

26:22.943 --> 26:25.544
In a manner of speaking.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.918
Cami: And your parents,
are they still around?

26:30.920 --> 26:34.122
Am I prying? I'm totally prying.

26:34.124 --> 26:36.025
All this talk about my family

26:36.027 --> 26:39.864
when you so recently
scolded me about boundaries.

26:39.866 --> 26:42.867
Just searching for coping methods,

26:42.869 --> 26:47.838
trying to learn from the master.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.407
Is that so?

26:50.409 --> 26:52.208
You must be lost.

26:52.210 --> 26:53.677
Vampires caught in the quarter

26:53.679 --> 26:56.645
are to be killed on sight.

26:56.647 --> 26:59.347
Go. Run as fast as you can.

26:59.349 --> 27:01.049
Just leave me here. Go.

27:01.051 --> 27:02.516
To hell with that.

27:02.518 --> 27:04.081
If they want a fight,
I'll give them a fight.

27:04.083 --> 27:07.082
No. I came with you to save one of my own,

27:07.084 --> 27:09.485
not watch as you kill scores of them.

27:09.487 --> 27:10.820
Take your friend out the back.

27:10.822 --> 27:13.223
Move as fast as you can.

27:13.225 --> 27:16.356
I'll hold them off here.

27:28.626 --> 27:31.926
Look. If I've offended you, I'm sorry.

27:31.926 --> 27:33.894
You haven't offended me.

27:33.896 --> 27:37.433
It's just, you seem on edge.

27:42.801 --> 27:44.802
Perhaps it's this Klaus business.

27:44.804 --> 27:48.975
Is there something you
haven't shared with me?

27:49.405 --> 27:51.641
[Clears throat]

27:51.643 --> 27:55.543
I guess I'm just nervous around you.

27:55.545 --> 27:57.446
I mean, I keep badgering you

27:57.448 --> 27:59.050
with my dumb questions.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.721
Your questions are quite smart.

28:00.723 --> 28:03.059
They're just personal,

28:03.061 --> 28:07.560
and your interest is unexpected.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.169
Maybe this is my passive-aggressive way

28:13.171 --> 28:15.142
of trying to change the subject

28:15.144 --> 28:16.610
from where I'm afraid you're headed.

28:16.612 --> 28:18.011
Which is?

28:18.013 --> 28:19.813
I think you're going to tell me

28:19.815 --> 28:21.616
to stop spending time with Klaus.

28:21.618 --> 28:23.351
Cami, you're an intelligent woman.

28:23.353 --> 28:25.521
You're articulate, poised.

28:25.523 --> 28:27.957
I think you can tell
for yourself what's best.

28:28.792 --> 28:29.858
Oh!

28:29.860 --> 28:32.895
You know, sometimes I ask myself

28:32.897 --> 28:37.001
why I let people like Klaus into my life.

28:37.003 --> 28:39.639
I have this destructive pattern.

28:39.641 --> 28:43.277
I'm always drawn to the bad boys.

28:43.279 --> 28:46.782
Maybe deep down,

28:46.784 --> 28:49.553
I feel like that's what I deserve.

28:51.923 --> 28:57.596
Hey, Cami, I'm an expert
in unhealthy patterns.

28:57.598 --> 29:00.633
I've broken some of my own,

29:00.635 --> 29:03.102
and I can help you do the same

29:03.104 --> 29:05.272
if you'll let me.

29:15.148 --> 29:17.317
Aagh! Aargh!

29:19.788 --> 29:22.292
Run. Uh!

29:22.294 --> 29:24.191
Aagh!

29:29.965 --> 29:32.034
Agh...

29:33.971 --> 29:36.307
Marcel: Ah...

29:45.151 --> 29:48.389
Aiden: Come on out!

29:48.456 --> 29:50.256
We know you're here.

30:01.837 --> 30:03.838
Why don't you just let us go,

30:03.840 --> 30:06.339
and we can call it a day?

30:09.974 --> 30:11.410
No. I don't think so.

30:11.412 --> 30:13.446
Then we do this the hard way.

30:15.281 --> 30:17.282
Oliver: You idiots.

30:19.218 --> 30:22.956
You're lining up to fight a hybrid?

30:22.958 --> 30:26.792
For what, so you can kill me,

30:26.794 --> 30:31.533
all because some witch gave an order?

30:32.903 --> 30:36.539
I know I ain't innocent,
but I never lost sight

30:36.541 --> 30:39.574
of what I was fighting for.

30:39.576 --> 30:43.313
We were gonna be a pack.

30:44.975 --> 30:47.546
But now...

30:49.217 --> 30:51.618
We are turning on each other,

30:51.620 --> 30:54.620
killing your own people.

30:54.622 --> 30:57.289
We do that,

30:57.291 --> 31:00.294
we're nothing.

31:41.453 --> 31:43.621
You.

31:47.723 --> 31:50.390
- Niklaus...
- No. No.

31:50.392 --> 31:52.092
- You're not real.
- Niklaus...

31:52.094 --> 31:55.094
No! You're a phantom conjured by Esther.

31:55.096 --> 31:59.531
That is all you are.
Mother, stop this charade.

31:59.533 --> 32:02.368
I know that thing is not real.

32:02.370 --> 32:04.773
Look at me, Niklaus.

32:08.244 --> 32:10.713
I am flesh and blood...

32:12.549 --> 32:14.113
Your flesh and blood.

32:14.115 --> 32:15.749
You've been dead 1,000 years.

32:15.751 --> 32:16.951
Through that time,

32:16.953 --> 32:18.353
I lingered on the other side

32:18.355 --> 32:20.891
watching you let the world fall apart

32:20.893 --> 32:23.393
until I woke 4 moons past

32:23.395 --> 32:25.159
in a land of wolves like myself.

32:25.161 --> 32:30.431
No. No. No. You're just in my head.

32:30.433 --> 32:32.535
You're an illusion meant by my mother

32:32.537 --> 32:34.873
to sway me to accept her bargain.

32:34.875 --> 32:37.139
I do not speak for Esther.

32:37.141 --> 32:39.974
I know nothing of her bargains...

32:46.682 --> 32:49.817
But you are my son.

33:05.164 --> 33:08.866
Even if what you say is real...

33:12.503 --> 33:15.006
You are nothing to me.

33:16.910 --> 33:20.847
For all I care, you can crawl back to hell.

33:50.481 --> 33:52.683
You sure this is gonna work?

33:52.685 --> 33:55.920
Klaus' blood is the only
cure for a wolf bite.

33:55.922 --> 33:58.254
Thing is, I'm running low.

33:58.256 --> 34:00.922
So new rule... Don't get bit.

34:00.924 --> 34:02.893
I got bit saving your ass.

34:02.895 --> 34:04.930
Yeah, and you did good, too.

34:04.932 --> 34:06.834
I got to admit, though, when you took off,

34:06.836 --> 34:08.835
I thought you were gone.

34:08.838 --> 34:10.969
All my life, when things got tough,

34:10.971 --> 34:13.438
that's what I would do.

34:13.440 --> 34:16.677
I would run because I never fit in, anyway,

34:16.679 --> 34:19.915
but this place, what you're building here,

34:19.917 --> 34:23.185
it fits.

34:23.187 --> 34:28.558
So I'm in, no running, no matter what.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.958
And thanks for sticking it out.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.960
Yeah.

34:33.962 --> 34:35.764
[Cell phone rings]

34:35.766 --> 34:37.969
I got to take this.

34:37.971 --> 34:40.237
- [Beep]
- You ok?

34:40.239 --> 34:42.007
Cami, on phone: Yeah.

34:42.009 --> 34:44.078
To be honest, not the worst
date I've had in this city.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.746
Yeah. Seemed like you had him

34:45.748 --> 34:47.618
wrapped around your finger
by the time I left.

34:47.649 --> 34:48.681
More than that.

34:48.684 --> 34:50.617
Vincent, Finn, whoever he is,

34:50.619 --> 34:52.117
I think he likes me.

34:52.119 --> 34:54.150
I don't know if I'd call that good news.

34:54.152 --> 34:56.619
Don't you get it? I'm his blind spot.

34:56.621 --> 34:58.187
If he's distracted, he's vulnerable,

34:58.189 --> 35:01.293
which means I can help take him down.

35:05.229 --> 35:08.995
Jackson: Well, you got him. Great.

35:08.997 --> 35:10.864
Where's Ansel?

35:10.866 --> 35:14.502
He was busy being a man.
He should be right behind us.

35:14.504 --> 35:17.973
Jack, I have to tell you...

35:17.975 --> 35:19.641
I already know, Ollie.

35:19.643 --> 35:22.677
You sold me out to Francesca.

35:22.679 --> 35:25.114
Look.

35:25.116 --> 35:29.319
I know that I can't make up for that...

35:31.120 --> 35:33.321
But you need to hear this.

35:33.323 --> 35:35.123
You're the one.

35:38.062 --> 35:39.797
You're the Alpha.

35:39.799 --> 35:42.332
Our people are not meant to be slaves.

35:44.436 --> 35:48.142
You can free them.

35:50.048 --> 35:52.216
[Coughing]

35:55.119 --> 35:58.723
Ollie? Ollie? What is wrong with him?

35:58.725 --> 36:00.726
It's the witches.

36:00.728 --> 36:01.929
Ollie?

36:01.931 --> 36:03.698
They said he only had until midnight.

36:03.700 --> 36:04.966
Stay with me.

36:04.968 --> 36:07.167
[Coughing]

36:07.169 --> 36:08.733
Jack...

36:08.735 --> 36:10.903
[Coughing]

36:57.235 --> 36:59.272
Oh...

37:02.146 --> 37:05.148
Wake up, brother.

37:05.150 --> 37:06.850
Elijah...

37:06.852 --> 37:10.554
Lenore: He won't wake, not yet,

37:10.556 --> 37:12.757
which gives you and I one last chance

37:12.759 --> 37:15.294
to discuss my offer.

37:18.667 --> 37:22.905
You promised me Elijah's safe return...

37:25.644 --> 37:27.880
Or was that a lie

37:27.882 --> 37:29.950
just like that ghoulish atrocity

37:29.952 --> 37:31.751
outside claiming to be my father

37:31.753 --> 37:33.151
back from the dead?

37:33.153 --> 37:34.817
Your father's return is real.

37:34.819 --> 37:37.756
I pulled him from the other
side before it collapsed,

37:37.758 --> 37:39.826
left him in the bayou to join the wolves,

37:39.828 --> 37:42.693
and I used the execution of one of his own

37:42.695 --> 37:46.125
to draw him here, where
I knew he'd find you.

37:46.127 --> 37:50.833
To what end besides my torment?

37:50.835 --> 37:55.936
I brought him here to be
the father you never had,

37:55.938 --> 37:59.808
to teach you to become the man
you always longed to be.

37:59.810 --> 38:02.112
Once you are remade as a werewolf,

38:02.114 --> 38:04.180
you can join him.

38:04.182 --> 38:06.878
[Music playing]

38:06.880 --> 38:09.849
His return

38:09.851 --> 38:12.185
changes nothing.

38:12.187 --> 38:14.954
It changes everything.

38:14.956 --> 38:18.120
It is my gift to you, Niklaus.

38:18.122 --> 38:21.993
This offer is your last
chance at salvation.

38:21.995 --> 38:24.329
Reject me now, and you will live out

38:24.331 --> 38:27.699
your endless days unloved and alone.

38:27.701 --> 38:31.004
Do not refuse me out of some ancient spite.

38:31.006 --> 38:35.408
Not spite, hatred,

38:35.410 --> 38:37.710
a pure and perfect hatred that's

38:37.712 --> 38:39.011
greater now than the day

38:39.013 --> 38:40.379
I first took your life.

38:40.381 --> 38:41.745
Why?

38:41.747 --> 38:43.879
After all I've done to explain to you,

38:43.881 --> 38:45.147
why must you persist...

38:45.149 --> 38:48.385
Because you came for my child,

38:48.387 --> 38:51.256
my daughter, your own blood!

38:51.258 --> 38:53.857
You don't understand.

38:53.859 --> 38:56.526
My child!

38:56.528 --> 38:59.762
Niklaus, I had to...

39:07.639 --> 39:09.741
You declared war when you

39:09.743 --> 39:13.012
came after my family, and for that,

39:13.014 --> 39:17.179
I will make you suffer as only I can.

39:18.314 --> 39:22.214
After all, I am my mother's son.

39:38.866 --> 39:40.935
Esther: Please do not do this.

39:40.937 --> 39:42.437
You wanted a family.

39:42.439 --> 39:45.509
Fate said otherwise, and so you came to me,

39:45.511 --> 39:48.409
and for a price, I granted your wish.

39:48.411 --> 39:50.041
Now I must collect.

39:50.043 --> 39:51.577
When Mikael returns
from his journey, I swear...

39:51.579 --> 39:53.778
You will tell him Freya grew ill and died.

39:53.780 --> 39:54.912
No, Dahlia.

39:54.914 --> 39:57.380
You were forced to burn her
body to stop the spread of plague.

39:57.382 --> 39:59.280
Sister, please, I cannot give up my child.

39:59.282 --> 40:00.613
You've already offered me more

40:00.615 --> 40:02.378
than just this one child.

40:02.380 --> 40:04.112
Our bargain was for this firstborn

40:04.114 --> 40:06.547
and every firstborn of each generation

40:06.549 --> 40:08.448
that is to come for as long

40:08.450 --> 40:11.250
as your line shall last.

40:11.252 --> 40:14.715
You do this, if you take my daughter,

40:14.717 --> 40:16.418
I swear to you, I will return

40:16.420 --> 40:18.921
to the black arts, and I will grow in power

40:18.923 --> 40:20.789
as a witch, and I will make you pay!

40:20.791 --> 40:24.258
Your power is nothing against mine.

40:24.260 --> 40:28.727
Foolish girl, you knew
the bargain you made,

40:28.729 --> 40:32.393
and should you defy me,

40:32.395 --> 40:35.960
then I will take all your children,

40:35.962 --> 40:38.799
including little Finn,

40:38.801 --> 40:40.268
even unborn Elijah.

40:40.270 --> 40:42.167
No. Dahlia...

40:44.403 --> 40:46.837
- Mommy...
- Freya. Wait!

40:46.839 --> 40:49.005
Mama!

40:49.007 --> 40:52.642
Help! Mama!

40:57.645 --> 41:00.644
Mama? What happened?

41:02.613 --> 41:06.986
Niklaus... Refused my offer.

41:09.320 --> 41:13.091
Lenore: He's still burdened
