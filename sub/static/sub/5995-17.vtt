REBECCA:
 Previously on
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:03.570 --> 00:04.538
Do you love her?

00:04.572 --> 00:07.241
No. God, no.

00:07.275 --> 00:09.377
Josh, focus on your girlfriend
and on your family.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.244
Are you kicking me out?

00:10.278 --> 00:11.545
Bye, Josh.

00:11.579 --> 00:13.114
PAULA:
 If we're not chasing Josh,

00:13.147 --> 00:14.682
then you're not gonna
want to hang out

00:14.715 --> 00:15.816
with me anymore,
I know it.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.085
REBECCA:
 This isn't about

00:17.118 --> 00:18.119
anyone else but you.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.387
You're not second choice.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.122
This is gonna be,
like, three days

00:21.155 --> 00:23.023
of you and me
just ruining each other.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.730
*

00:31.832 --> 00:34.135
"Gaseity"?

00:34.168 --> 00:36.170
What? That's not a word.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.605
Incorrect. It is a word.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.108
It is the state or condition
of being gassy or gaseous,

00:40.141 --> 00:43.311
and, most importantly,
it is 35 points for moi.

00:44.712 --> 00:45.679
I think you're cheating.

00:45.713 --> 00:46.847
Yep. Yeah, you're cheating.
Give me your phone.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.182
How could I be cheating?
Nope.

00:48.216 --> 00:49.517
I'm sitting right next to you...
Hey! Hey!
Give me your phone.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.719
Give me your phone,
let me see what you're doing.
Hey, hey!

00:51.752 --> 00:53.421
I'm just curious
how you're doing this.
Give me that.

00:53.454 --> 00:55.389
Give me that.
I'm just curious how
you're doing this.

00:55.423 --> 00:56.390
Hello again.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.658
Oh, hello.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.427
Shall we?

01:01.662 --> 01:02.630
Okay.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.298
(giggles)

01:08.602 --> 01:10.604
(breathing deeply)

01:16.744 --> 01:18.712
Ugh. I gotta go to work.

01:18.746 --> 01:21.449
No! No...

01:21.482 --> 01:23.617
Boo work and life

01:23.651 --> 01:25.719
and clothing.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.821
I don't want to leave
the sex cocoon.

01:27.855 --> 01:30.691
So, I will, uh, call you later,

01:30.724 --> 01:32.560
or text you,

01:32.593 --> 01:35.763
and, uh, see if you want
to play any, uh, "word games,"

01:35.796 --> 01:37.365
if you know what I'm saying.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.533
Hey, actually, um...

01:39.567 --> 01:41.802
we should... we should probably
talk for a second.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.904
You probably want to
talk about, you know,

01:43.937 --> 01:47.308
all these changes and how
our relationship is evolving,

01:47.341 --> 01:50.544
'cause we had such
a complex history...

01:50.578 --> 01:52.813
Oh, you mean because you, like,
broke my heart a bunch of times?

01:52.846 --> 01:55.416
I don't care about that anymore.

01:56.917 --> 01:57.885
But... what?

01:57.918 --> 01:59.553
But... no, no. But... you know.

01:59.587 --> 02:00.754
We have so much drama

02:00.788 --> 02:01.889
and you've asked me out
so many times

02:01.922 --> 02:03.757
and you... you ran
to the courthouse.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.759
Honestly,
it's like a distant memory.

02:07.561 --> 02:08.696
Okay.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.898
So you-you...

02:10.931 --> 02:12.500
you just want
to keep things casual?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.902
Yep. Just light and polite.

02:14.935 --> 02:18.339
Except in the bedroom, you dig?

02:19.373 --> 02:20.908
I dig. Yeah.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.912
You're so pretty.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.046
It's so cool
that I get to

02:26.079 --> 02:29.217
say that to you now that
I'm not all obsessed, you know?

02:29.250 --> 02:31.151
It's great, isn't it?

02:32.720 --> 02:33.754
Yep.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.689
It's... yeah, oh, phee-ew.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.425
It's great.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.792
Yeah.

02:38.826 --> 02:39.927
Peace.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.762
Peace.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.266
(door opens)

02:45.299 --> 02:47.368
Peace?
(door closes)

02:47.401 --> 02:50.238
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

02:50.271 --> 02:51.905
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

02:51.939 --> 02:53.641
* One day I was crying a lot

02:53.674 --> 02:54.808
* And so I decided to move

02:54.842 --> 02:56.577
* To West Covina, California

02:56.610 --> 02:57.845
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

02:57.878 --> 03:00.214
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

03:00.248 --> 03:02.816
* But that's not why I'm here

03:02.850 --> 03:04.885
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.520
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

03:06.554 --> 03:07.888
That's a sexist term.

03:07.921 --> 03:08.889
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

03:08.922 --> 03:10.558
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

03:10.591 --> 03:12.960
* She's so broken inside *

03:12.993 --> 03:14.595
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.597
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

03:16.630 --> 03:17.931
Okay! We get it!

03:17.965 --> 03:20.401
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

03:20.434 --> 03:22.803
*

03:28.876 --> 03:30.244
What is up with you?

03:30.278 --> 03:31.645
You got a bit
of a glow about you.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.481
Not a sweaty glow,
but, like, a glowy glow.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.749
(gasps)
Is this because you talked to...

03:35.783 --> 03:36.750
No, no, no. Don't say his name.

03:36.784 --> 03:37.918
...Josh?
No.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.387
I did not talk to Josh,

03:39.420 --> 03:40.588
because Josh is done.

03:40.621 --> 03:41.589
We are done
with Josh.

03:41.622 --> 03:42.623
Okay?
Right.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.758
Let's talk about something else.

03:50.464 --> 03:52.533
How was your weekend?

03:52.566 --> 03:53.334
Stupid.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.302
Come on, Paula.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.003
I need you
to try, okay?

03:56.036 --> 03:58.872
It got chilly. Right?

03:58.906 --> 04:01.409
I had to take my sweaters
out of the space bag.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.477
Oh, my God, this is so boring!

04:03.511 --> 04:04.345
Come on.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.713
This is an apocalypse.

04:06.747 --> 04:10.017
Do I smell Paula's famous
blueberry almond pie?

04:10.050 --> 04:11.719
Mm-hmm.
No, Darryl,

04:11.752 --> 04:14.855
you're a judge-- you'll get
plenty of pie at the contest.

04:14.888 --> 04:15.956
Judge? Contest? What?

04:15.989 --> 04:18.492
No, it's just this stupid
pie contest I do every year.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.293
It is not stupid.
It's great.

04:20.327 --> 04:21.595
And I'm a judge this year.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.030
I just applied and I got in.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.031
PAULA:
Okay, Darryl, go away.

04:24.064 --> 04:24.998
Come on, we're talking.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.034
Yeah, well, you know what?
This is my office.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.802
I pay for you guys
to be here.

04:31.539 --> 04:33.641
I think I've made my point.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.078
(sighs heavily)

04:38.111 --> 04:41.682
Paula! Oh, my God, you never
told me about a pie contest.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.384
You're such a little liar.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.052
What?
Yeah, according to
the act of omission,

04:45.085 --> 04:47.054
it is a lie.
Calm down.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.390
I lose every year.
There's this woman,

04:49.423 --> 04:51.559
Peggy Rose-- she owns
the pie shop on East Cameron--

04:51.592 --> 04:52.926
she always wins.
Well, this year,

04:52.960 --> 04:54.862
you're gonna win,
'cause I'm gonna help you.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.964
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I see what this is.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.533
This isn't about pie--
you're trying to distract me

04:59.567 --> 05:01.969
from Josh-- you're trying
to give us a new mission.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.604
God, this is
just like that time

05:03.637 --> 05:05.673
Scott and I decided
to have that second kid.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.575
Oh. No, it's not like that.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.510
I'm not trying to distract
you from my love life.

05:09.543 --> 05:10.944
(phone chimes)

05:10.978 --> 05:12.079
Just one... sorry,
one second.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.981
I'm sorry, Just, um...

05:16.717 --> 05:17.985
Uh, you know what?

05:18.018 --> 05:20.754
I am...
gonna head out right now

05:20.788 --> 05:23.591
to the local
pie supply shop...

05:23.624 --> 05:24.692
Or grocery store.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.826
Okay, to each his own.

05:25.859 --> 05:26.760
And I'm gonna get

05:26.794 --> 05:28.996
all of the baking supplies
we need to win.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.932
And don't you worry about this,
because I am on top of it,

05:31.965 --> 05:34.134
I'm all over it,
I'm just covered in it.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.469
(exhales)

05:35.503 --> 05:39.106
Mm, you really are
awesome at that.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.108
Good call on the bathroom,
by the way.

05:41.141 --> 05:43.477
Like, really good choice.
Thanks.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.012
I used a new app--
it shows you

05:45.045 --> 05:46.614
where all the nearest
public bathrooms are.

05:46.647 --> 05:50.418
It's for people with IBS,
but it works great for us.

05:50.451 --> 05:52.052
(giggles)
Sorry, we couldn't
go to my place.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.121
Lately my dad's been, uh...

05:54.154 --> 05:55.989
living there for 30 years.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.626
Yeah, yeah, and, look, I wish
we could go more to my place,

05:58.659 --> 06:01.061
but I just don't want Heather
to see you coming and going.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.030
I think it might be tacky
and, you know,

06:03.063 --> 06:04.765
complex, and-and...
Shh, shh. Don't worry about it.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.100
This is working out great.
I love it.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.469
Okay.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.471
Great.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.005
So, um...

06:12.039 --> 06:14.141
you want to text me later?

06:14.174 --> 06:15.909
Why don't you text me?

06:16.944 --> 06:19.547
Oh. I see.
So you're the boss now.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.081
Yeah.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.183
Okay. Well...

06:23.216 --> 06:25.419
I will text you, then.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.319
Yeah.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.789
Oh, I'm gonna text you
just how you like it

06:28.822 --> 06:30.190
with a ton of emojis--

06:30.223 --> 06:32.092
there's gonna be,
like, a pizza

06:32.125 --> 06:34.094
and a rocket, and you're
gonna go be, like,

06:34.127 --> 06:36.096
"Yeah... mmm..."

06:37.097 --> 06:38.966
Mmm...

06:38.999 --> 06:42.202
Mmm. These candles
are amazing. Smell.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.871
And how cute

06:43.904 --> 06:44.972
Mm.
are these hats?

06:45.005 --> 06:47.541
Ah. It is such an honor
that your sister asked me

06:47.575 --> 06:49.943
to do the gift bags
for her wedding--
I can't believe it.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.546
Yeah, I'm happy
you're happy, babe.

06:52.580 --> 06:53.981
(sighs)

06:54.014 --> 06:55.983
I love weddings.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.685
Two people coming together,

06:57.718 --> 06:59.720
pledging their devotion
for the rest of their lives

06:59.753 --> 07:01.922
in front of all their
friends and loved ones.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.924
Yeah. That's a wedding.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.159
It is so great

07:06.193 --> 07:09.062
that this wedding can remind
us about what truly matters?

07:09.096 --> 07:12.065
We have been tested, and now
we're stronger than ever.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.066
Yeah.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.802
We know where
we're headed.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.804
We know what the future is.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.473
We don't have to worry
about Rebecca anymore.

07:19.507 --> 07:23.811
Nothing and no one can come
between us ever again.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.078
(quiet grunt)

07:25.112 --> 07:26.580
Right?

07:29.917 --> 07:31.919
(inhales deeply)

07:33.587 --> 07:35.823
(drops gift bag, exhales)

07:35.856 --> 07:38.692
*
(crickets chirping)

07:38.726 --> 07:40.794
REBECCA:
Okay, mama, I'm ready to bake.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.096
I got so much fun stuff!

07:43.130 --> 07:45.799
I got every single
flour imaginable.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.768
I got buckwheat
flour and...

07:47.801 --> 07:49.236
spelt and almond flour...

07:49.269 --> 07:50.504
Oh, my gosh, wait.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.706
This is my
favorite one.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.974
Cricket flour.

07:54.007 --> 07:54.908
Nope.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.711
Yes. It's actually
highly proteinaceous.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.547
That is a word, incidentally,

07:59.580 --> 08:01.081
that I played today
in Words with Friends,

08:01.114 --> 08:03.050
and I got a ton
of points for it.
Ah.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.918
Which friend?
Oh, it was a random play.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.721
Yeah, some girl in Holland--
uh, GoudaGirl189.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.593
Are you sure?

08:12.626 --> 08:15.596
Are you sure you're just
playing with... a friend?

08:15.629 --> 08:16.930
Y-Yeah.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.298
What are you talking about?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.733
Uh, then why are your...

08:19.767 --> 08:21.001
panties in your pocket?!
What?

08:21.034 --> 08:22.169
Oh, uh-huh.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.036
Paula, okay, ew.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.004
Paula, just... okay,

08:24.037 --> 08:24.938
(whoops)
all right, okay,

08:24.972 --> 08:27.240
let's talk about our
boundary issues, okay?

08:27.274 --> 08:29.810
Come on, fess up-- who are
you sleeping with? Come on.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.645
Okay, you know
how horny I am,

08:31.679 --> 08:33.013
and I am totally on board

08:33.046 --> 08:34.782
for some post-heartbreak
gettin' down,

08:34.815 --> 08:36.784
so tell me, who is it,
who is it?

08:36.817 --> 08:38.318
Who is it? Who is it?

08:38.351 --> 08:40.688
It's no one.
Really, it's no one.

08:40.721 --> 08:44.024
I'm not having intercourse
with anyone. Yeah.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.759
Baby...

08:45.793 --> 08:47.961
if you are getting
your butterfly smashed,

08:47.995 --> 08:49.029
I am all for it--

08:49.062 --> 08:50.831
as long as it's not Greg.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.666
Greg? Why would you say...
why would you even, like,

08:52.700 --> 08:54.768
mention his name?
That's weird.
Because he's

08:54.802 --> 08:56.169
always buzzing around you--
he's, like,

08:56.203 --> 08:57.871
this sexy Italian fly,
and you're, like,

08:57.905 --> 08:59.339
this old meatball in an alley.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.742
You know what? I'm not
sleeping with Greg.
Good.

09:01.775 --> 09:03.677
Look, I like the guy,
I really do,

09:03.711 --> 09:05.312
but he is not romance material.

09:05.345 --> 09:08.716
Okay, he is a booze hound,
he is completely shut down,

09:08.749 --> 09:10.283
and he is angry.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.352
(gasps) He's kind of like
that Star Wars villain.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.188
You know, the new one, with the,
like, the really great hair?

09:15.222 --> 09:18.258
Paula, I get it.
You don't like Greg. Okay?
Hey,

09:18.291 --> 09:20.193
not to mention,
he is Josh's best friend, okay?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.795
And if you sleep
with Josh's best friend,

09:21.829 --> 09:23.296
that ruins any possibility
for when you finally

09:23.330 --> 09:25.899
come to your senses and realize
that you are meant for Josh.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.201
Okay, okay, Paula,
Paula, listen.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.303
(exhales)
I promise...

09:30.337 --> 09:32.205
nobody, including Greg,

09:32.239 --> 09:34.608
is smashing my butterfly.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.210
Oh, God, do it!
Smash my butterfly!

09:37.244 --> 09:38.245
(exhales)

09:38.278 --> 09:39.146
What?

09:45.919 --> 09:48.321
So, the butterfly
metaphor.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.758
(smacks lips)
Oh... yeah,

09:50.791 --> 09:53.326
it's just a little something
I picked up on the street.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.395
Well, if we're going
with obscure metaphors,

09:55.428 --> 09:56.797
I'm right there with you.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.198
Oh, really?
Lay some on me.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.900
I don't know if you
can handle it.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.168
I can handle anything,
Serrano.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.903
I will crumble
your zebra.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.204
Uh-huh.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.840
I will sauté
your giraffe.
Oh, that's good.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.042
I will flambé
your cockatoo.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.344
(laughing):
I like that one.

10:11.378 --> 10:13.313
Mm-hmm.
Oh, hold on.
I got to pee.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.915
I'll be right back.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.149
Good-bye.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.384
(gasps)

10:17.417 --> 10:18.919
(door opens)

10:18.952 --> 10:20.688
Flambé your cockatoo.
(door closes)

10:20.721 --> 10:23.323
(chuckles softly)
I'm funny.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.659
(groaning)

10:25.693 --> 10:27.861
That took a while.

10:27.895 --> 10:29.930
What's up?
I, um... I'll be fine.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.398
It just burns when I pee.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.166
(groans)

10:33.200 --> 10:35.435
This has happened to me before.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.404
I think I have a UTI.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.707
Urinary tract infection.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.373
What is that?

10:40.407 --> 10:42.242
Oh, you're such a man.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.176
Okay, so a UTI

10:43.210 --> 10:45.178
is an inflammation

10:45.212 --> 10:46.914
of the urethra caused

10:46.947 --> 10:49.883
by excessive amounts
of vigorous sexual activity.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.451
(chuckles)

10:51.484 --> 10:54.121
It also doesn't help

10:54.154 --> 10:57.357
if a man is too, uh...

10:57.390 --> 11:00.193
Too... what?

11:00.227 --> 11:01.829
Capacious.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.263
Ooh! That's 25 points.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.732
I don't know that word.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.266
I must be dumb
from all the blood

11:06.299 --> 11:08.335
rushing towards my capacious...

11:08.368 --> 11:09.236
Okay, okay.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.838
A UTI.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.973
Huh.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.342
(laughs)

11:15.375 --> 11:17.745
What? What's going on?
Why are you clapping?

11:18.779 --> 11:19.980
Like, seriously,
what's happening?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.015
*

11:24.117 --> 11:28.388
(musical clanging)

11:28.421 --> 11:30.390
* What's
that's burning feelin' *

11:30.423 --> 11:32.125
* Every time you pee?

11:32.159 --> 11:34.394
* Well, that's how it goes
after you have so *

11:34.427 --> 11:37.430
* Much awesome sex with me,
I gave you *

11:38.531 --> 11:39.767
* A UTI

11:40.934 --> 11:42.903
* Yeah, I gave you

11:42.936 --> 11:44.037
* A UTI

11:45.873 --> 11:47.507
* My sweet love injection

11:47.540 --> 11:49.777
* Caused
a urinary tract infection *

11:49.810 --> 11:53.881
* I'm just that good,
I didn't even try, try, try *

11:54.815 --> 11:57.417
* I gave you a UTI

11:57.450 --> 11:59.152
Okay.
So it's not really a comment

11:59.186 --> 12:01.755
on the quality of the sex
as much as a lot of sex

12:01.789 --> 12:03.190
has been happening
and there's just

12:03.223 --> 12:05.192
a very natural transfer
of bacteria

12:05.225 --> 12:06.927
to my...
Don't ruin this for me.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.429
* That bladder inflammation

12:09.462 --> 12:11.431
* Is my little gift to you

12:11.464 --> 12:14.034
* Yeah, sometimes chicks
need medication *

12:14.067 --> 12:15.903
* After
what I put them through *

12:15.936 --> 12:17.504
Come on, sing with me!

12:17.537 --> 12:18.405
No, I'm not gonna do that.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.840
* I gave you

12:19.873 --> 12:21.408
* I gave you, a UTI

12:21.441 --> 12:23.310
* A UTI, yeah, I gave you

12:23.343 --> 12:26.079
* I gave you, a UTI

12:26.113 --> 12:28.015
* A UTI

12:28.048 --> 12:30.017
* I'm so good at sex

12:30.050 --> 12:32.352
* Your maiden ship got wrecked

12:32.385 --> 12:36.824
* My penis is the reason
you may die, die, die *

12:36.857 --> 12:39.759
* I gave you a UTI

12:40.861 --> 12:42.796
* One night with me
is pure ecstasy *

12:42.830 --> 12:45.298
* 'Cause I know
just what you like *

12:45.332 --> 12:47.968
* But you should know for a week
or so you won't be able *

12:48.001 --> 12:49.036
* To ride a bike

12:49.069 --> 12:51.504
I'm so sorry if you have
to cancel that spin class.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.107
I'll pay the cancellation
fee, because I know a lot
times you have to book

12:54.141 --> 12:56.476
a specific bike
in advance.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.046
Anyway...
* I gave you, I gave you

12:59.079 --> 13:02.816
* A UTI, a UTI, not an STD

13:02.850 --> 13:05.085
* No STDs, just to clarify

13:05.118 --> 13:06.319
Okay, good to know. Whoa.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.221
* If it hurts to take a leak

13:08.255 --> 13:11.158
* Well, that's just part
of my technique *

13:11.191 --> 13:13.827
* What has two thumbs
and gave you a UTI? *

13:13.861 --> 13:15.829
* This guy

13:15.863 --> 13:18.098
* I gave you a U-T-I

13:18.131 --> 13:21.969
* Gave you a U-T-I gave you

13:22.002 --> 13:26.940
* A UTI...

13:27.975 --> 13:29.242
Oh.

13:30.277 --> 13:31.511
Okay.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.948
(laughing)

13:34.982 --> 13:38.051
Well, if one good thing can come
from my searing pain,

13:38.085 --> 13:40.120
it's that it feeds your ego.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.454
Oh, I'm just being silly.
I'm kidding.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.256
I'm fine. I caught it early.
I'll just take

13:43.290 --> 13:45.158
some cranberry pills
and painkillers.

13:45.192 --> 13:46.860
Great, you got this.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.862
Hey, um, I had a fun idea.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.298
I was thinking maybe I
could work remotely from...

13:51.331 --> 13:54.201
Home Base today. What do you...
what do you think about that?

13:54.234 --> 13:55.869
Yeah, sure. If you want.

13:55.903 --> 13:56.870
Okay, great.
Mwah.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.538
(whistling)

13:58.571 --> 14:00.540
Okay. I'll s...
(door opens)

14:00.573 --> 14:03.310
I'll see you... there.
(door closes)

14:05.345 --> 14:07.314
*

14:18.358 --> 14:21.094
Peppy Greg is weird.
What's up?

14:21.128 --> 14:22.495
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.564
Just a lovely day in the 'Cov.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.066
Do you have one of
those brain tumors

14:26.099 --> 14:28.068
that changes
your personality?

14:28.101 --> 14:29.937
Can you play
the violin now?

14:31.338 --> 14:33.306
Serrano's
in a good mood.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.308
Yeah.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.276
It's gross.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.912
Like, I would've never slept
with that guy.

14:38.946 --> 14:42.950
So, why do you need
so many Home Base Bucks?

14:42.983 --> 14:45.052
Welcome bags
for my sister's wedding.

14:45.085 --> 14:46.286
It's cute that
you're helping Valencia out.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.188
It's like you're
an assistant bridesmaid.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.489
(scoffs)
But, dude,
aren't you worried

14:49.522 --> 14:51.324
that marriage is contagious?

14:51.358 --> 14:54.327
Like, Valencia's probably, like,
all up on you to propose, right?

14:54.361 --> 14:56.063
No, not really.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.932
I mean, she's not hurrying me
or anything.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.101
She respects me too much.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.036
(laughing)

15:03.070 --> 15:04.504
She respects you.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.439
(laughing)

15:06.473 --> 15:08.208
Good one, bro.
(chuckling)

15:08.241 --> 15:09.542
Hey, guys.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.410
GREG:
Hey!
REBECCA: Hi.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.545
How are you? It's been a while.
I'm...

15:12.579 --> 15:15.382
Oh, right. Yeah, I haven't seen
you in, like, forever.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.316
Yeah.

15:16.349 --> 15:19.186
REBECCA:
Um... so...

15:19.219 --> 15:22.255
do you want to come find me
on your next break?
Yeah.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.623
You could help me in the back

15:23.656 --> 15:26.994
in the stockroom
zest the porcupine.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.496
Got it. Got it.
Um, that sounds good.
Yeah.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.430
You do get it.
Cool.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.698
They look like they just spent

15:31.731 --> 15:34.434
three days having sex
and eating Chinese food.

15:34.467 --> 15:35.735
What are you talking about?

15:35.768 --> 15:39.372
Okay, in Psych 3,
we studied human mating signals.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.474
They just did all of them:

15:41.508 --> 15:45.312
shrugging, eye contact,
head tilting,

15:45.345 --> 15:46.980
flamingo leg.

15:47.014 --> 15:49.149
Like...
Yep, flamingo leg.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.684
Next step is copulation.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.453
Oh.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.255
"Copulation" means "sex."

15:55.288 --> 15:56.556
I know what "copulation" means.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.992
But you are losing it.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.260
Greg and Rebecca?

16:00.293 --> 16:03.163
But sh-she doesn't
even like Greg, you...

16:03.196 --> 16:04.664
you...

16:04.697 --> 16:05.999
dumbface.

16:06.033 --> 16:09.002
Whoa. Josh, pull it together,
okay?

16:09.036 --> 16:11.304
I'm just stating, like,
clearly observable facts.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.572
What? No.

16:12.605 --> 16:16.709
I-I got to go, 'cause I don't
want to catch your... dumbness.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.316
(sighs)

16:26.586 --> 16:29.056
I have, like, the smartest face
in here.

16:29.089 --> 16:30.657
Okay, I'm gonna sit
over there.
I'm gonna stand over here.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.725
Okay. Great.
Okay.

16:35.228 --> 16:40.200
So, dude, you finally got
in there with Rebecca, huh?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.668
That only took
six months.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.203
No, it's not like that.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.074
Yeah, it's totally like that.

16:47.107 --> 16:50.577
So, you and Greg are
totally sleeping together.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.745
No, it's not like that.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.281
Um...

16:54.314 --> 16:56.116
Yeah, it's totally like that.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.085
Heather, I'm so sorry.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.486
I've been meaning
to tell you.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.720
I was gonna handwrite you
a letter,

17:00.753 --> 17:02.389
and then I was gonna seal it
with a wax seal

17:02.422 --> 17:03.490
that I got in
Colonial Williamsburg

17:03.523 --> 17:05.392
when I was 12
but I've never used it.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.694
I didn't do that. I'm so sorry.
Do you hate me?

17:08.728 --> 17:10.430
No, it's cool.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.333
You just have to get married
and have eight babies.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.634
What?
Well,

17:14.666 --> 17:16.636
you sleeping with my ex
hurts my feelings,

17:16.669 --> 17:18.637
but it's okay if it's love.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.607
It's the "meant to be"
exemption.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.076
Like, Woody and Soon-Yi
are still together,

17:23.109 --> 17:24.711
so that, like,
kind of makes it okay.

17:24.743 --> 17:26.213
Do you get what I'm saying?

17:26.246 --> 17:28.214
Um, okay.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.217
That analogy
doesn't really track,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.619
'cause Greg's not
my elderly de facto stepfather

17:32.652 --> 17:36.656
and also, um, we're not in love.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.758
I mean, yet. I don't know.

17:38.791 --> 17:39.826
I don't know how I feel.
I don't know how he feels.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.561
Should I call him?
Should I ask him? I don't know.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.363
Oh...

17:43.396 --> 17:45.398
Wait.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.334
Wait, what's
happening to me?

17:47.367 --> 17:48.801
How does he suddenly have
the upper hand?

17:48.835 --> 17:50.270
You've got the upper hand.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.372
She was jerking your chain,

17:52.405 --> 17:53.740
and now
she's jerking your chain.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.675
Dude, you are bro-ing out
so hard right now.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.545
I'm just so happy for you.
You know, before, you were all,

17:58.578 --> 18:01.381
like, "Please let me have it.
Please let me hold your taco

18:01.414 --> 18:02.882
while you sleep
with another guy."

18:02.915 --> 18:04.351
Okay, Hector,
I get what you're saying.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.852
I've had some tough times
with Rebecca,

18:05.885 --> 18:07.220
a few situations

18:07.254 --> 18:08.488
where my status was perhaps

18:08.521 --> 18:10.623
a skosh less than hers...

18:10.657 --> 18:13.293
Exactly. But now you're
in the driver's seat,

18:13.326 --> 18:15.828
cruising down the 405,
wind blowin' in your hair,

18:15.862 --> 18:17.630
listening to Backstreet Boys.

18:17.664 --> 18:18.798
Keep it goin'.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.533
That way
she can't burn you again.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.037
I don't know what's
going on with me.

18:25.071 --> 18:29.142
I mean, something, something has
changed in this whole dynamic,

18:29.176 --> 18:31.544
because I am in this bar,
drinking bad coffee,

18:31.578 --> 18:33.746
just so I can be close to him?

18:33.780 --> 18:36.249
Ew, I feel so stupid.
Oh, dude,

18:36.283 --> 18:37.784
don't get down on yourself.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.253
It's, like, simple biology.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.155
Okay, sex releases oxytocin,

18:42.189 --> 18:44.524
which causes the female to
imprint emotionally on the male.

18:45.725 --> 18:48.161
I got a B+ in physical science,
so...

18:48.195 --> 18:49.796
(sighs)

18:49.829 --> 18:52.665
By the way, how long have
you been in community college?

18:52.699 --> 18:53.533
Eight years.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.235
Rebecca,
it's simple.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.504
Before sex,
women have the power.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.307
After, men have it.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.808
That's a horrible thing to say.

19:01.841 --> 19:02.875
I didn't make it up.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.182
Hi.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.850
Nope. Nope.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.420
Okay, I'm a smart woman.
I have multiple degrees.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.522
So I'm not gonna do this.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.391
I'm going to go do
my work back at work.

19:18.425 --> 19:21.928
Because at work, I am valued
for things like my intelligence,

19:21.961 --> 19:24.931
my skills, and my
professional acumen,

19:24.964 --> 19:27.334
which I, as a smart
woman, also value.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.337
So, yeah, me and my dumb ovaries
are getting out of here.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.472
Okay. I don't...
I'm gonna carry it.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.341
Greg, um, I will
text you later,

19:34.374 --> 19:35.475
okay?
I'm gonna go.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.743
Uh, I'm gonna head out. So, uh,

19:36.776 --> 19:39.379
do you want to text me later?
Maybe I can text... I can text

19:39.412 --> 19:41.814
you later, because I don't know
how late you're... working.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.850
Damn it.

19:45.285 --> 19:48.255
(indistinct chatter)

19:48.288 --> 19:52.659
Hey, Sensei, you mind if I use
the dojo for a few minutes?

19:52.692 --> 19:53.826
What's up?
Well,

19:53.860 --> 19:55.828
you ever have a friend
and another friend

19:55.862 --> 19:57.897
and then you run into
that friend and find out

19:57.930 --> 19:59.932
that the first two friends
are maybe doing stuff

19:59.966 --> 20:02.369
that friends aren't supposed
to do if they're just friends?

20:02.402 --> 20:03.503
You know?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.438
Say no more.

20:05.472 --> 20:07.474
*

20:21.888 --> 20:22.822
JOSH:
 Angry!

20:24.324 --> 20:25.958
Feeling bad!

20:25.992 --> 20:27.594
(grunts)

20:27.627 --> 20:29.562
Why do I feel this way?

20:29.596 --> 20:31.431
Angry! Mad!

20:31.464 --> 20:34.734
My heart is hurting,
 and it feels... bad!

20:34.767 --> 20:36.002
Punching,

20:36.035 --> 20:38.305
feeling, crying, and...

20:38.338 --> 20:40.840
(groans)

20:40.873 --> 20:41.974
Bad!

20:42.008 --> 20:43.743
*

21:10.337 --> 21:11.571
(groans)

21:11.604 --> 21:13.340
Bad!

21:21.381 --> 21:23.082
*

21:23.115 --> 21:24.784
(indistinct conversations)

21:24.817 --> 21:26.519
This is exciting.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.755
Right?
Isn't this great?

21:28.788 --> 21:31.524
We're gonna figure out
Peggy Rose's secret ingredient.

21:31.558 --> 21:32.692
Hmm?

21:32.725 --> 21:33.860
It's fun.

21:33.893 --> 21:36.429
We're doing some es-pie-onage.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.564
(laughs)
I just thought of that.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.732
That was pretty good. Hey,
you know what's even better?

21:39.766 --> 21:41.868
What?
My list that I put together

21:41.901 --> 21:43.770
of the people you could
possibly be sleeping with.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.572
Paula, come on.
Here we go.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.707
In order of my preference.
One, the guy from spin class.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.776
Two, your spin instructor.
Three, John Stamos.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.044
Okay, stop talking about this.
I'm not sleeping with anyone.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.780
No sexy time.
I'm not

21:53.813 --> 21:55.382
having sex with anyone.

21:55.415 --> 21:56.783
Let's drop it
and focus on pie.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.085
Oh, there she is.
There's Peggy Rose.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.987
Let's follow her.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.722
Let's stalk her,
let's see what she does.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.491
No, we can't do that.
It's the middle of the day.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.626
Plus, we're not...
cartoon detectives.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.661
I know.

22:10.497 --> 22:13.800
What if we came back
at night-- broke in?

22:13.833 --> 22:15.868
It's a real devious plan.
You love devious plans.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.470
Eh...

22:17.504 --> 22:18.771
only if they're
about Josh.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.907
Tonight. We're gonna do it.
It's a date.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.643
Mm-hmm. Moi et toi.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.878
That's French for "me and you."
What? Oh.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.615
Yeah. Just...

22:28.648 --> 22:30.650
Why is it still...
You want... again?

22:30.683 --> 22:31.884
Yay.
All right.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.492
Ah, ah, ah...
Dude, I wasn't
finished with that.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.494
What are you
in such a rush about?

22:41.528 --> 22:43.029
The bar doesn't close till 11:00
and most of the customers

22:43.062 --> 22:44.531
have an 8:00 p.m. bedtime.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.032
I'm closing early.
There's no one's here.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.100
And I'm meeting Rebecca
at her place later.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.869
She wants me there
in half an hour.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.905
Oh, so, she tells you
where to go and what to do.

22:52.939 --> 22:54.641
Sounds like

22:54.674 --> 22:55.908
you're her little pet.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.644
Or shall I say,
her little bitch.

22:57.677 --> 22:58.611
Oh, calm down.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.847
You're spending way too much
time with Rebecca.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.715
You're in a danger zone
here, all right?

23:02.749 --> 23:05.585
You need to stay on track,
and head on down the highway.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.754
And how do I do that,
Kenny Loggins?

23:07.787 --> 23:09.422
Easy. Saturday night
I have a date

23:09.456 --> 23:10.723
with a girl named Angie.

23:10.757 --> 23:12.925
She's bringing her cousin
from Denver,

23:12.959 --> 23:15.595
and Angie says she's fun.

23:15.628 --> 23:16.929
What does that mean?

23:16.963 --> 23:18.598
It means she's fun.
Don't be disgusting.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.199
Greg,
dating other people

23:20.232 --> 23:23.102
is the number-one way
to maintain the upper hand.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.905
So, are you in?

23:27.574 --> 23:29.041
(sighs)

23:32.011 --> 23:35.047
Honey, guess what? I am almost
done with the gift bags.

23:35.081 --> 23:38.117
I just need you to fill
28 little potpourri sachets

23:38.150 --> 23:40.720
of cloves and lavender
and then we're done.
(refrigerator door closes)

23:40.753 --> 23:42.655
Later. I have
to take a shower.

23:42.689 --> 23:44.557
What is wrong, hon?

23:44.591 --> 23:46.626
I'm just... I'm in a bad mood.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.960
Uh...

23:47.994 --> 23:49.762
What, I can't be in a bad mood?

23:49.796 --> 23:51.998
It's like, people think,
"Oh, Josh is such a nice guy,

23:52.031 --> 23:54.033
"Josh is so happy-go-lucky,
Josh can't be

23:54.066 --> 23:55.201
in a bad mood."
but you know what?

23:55.234 --> 23:57.103
Josh can be in a bad mood,

23:57.136 --> 23:59.739
and right now
Josh is be in a bad mood.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.642
Okay, you are being so weird.

24:02.675 --> 24:05.144
Do you want company
in that shower?

24:05.177 --> 24:06.913
I'm... Okay, you know,
I'm sorry, just...

24:06.946 --> 24:08.615
Not right now. Another time.

24:08.648 --> 24:10.483
Are you rejecting me?

24:10.517 --> 24:12.018
Are you turning down sex?

24:12.051 --> 24:14.153
Josh can turn down sex.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.188
And... and-and that's
what he is be doing.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.025
(scoffs)

24:21.928 --> 24:23.930
What is wrong with Josh?

24:29.669 --> 24:31.103
*

24:33.806 --> 24:36.576
I'm here for you, my son.

24:36.609 --> 24:38.077
You're gonna have to stop
calling that.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.612
We're the same age, brah.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.781
Whoa. Josh, why are you
getting so crabby, man?

24:41.814 --> 24:43.049
Is it 'cause you
keep losing?

24:43.082 --> 24:44.784
You can't beat
yourself up for that,

24:44.817 --> 24:46.886
because I've got
Jesus on my side.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.121
All right...
That's not your
piece. I'm red.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.224
Why is everyone always telling
me what to do all the time?

24:53.292 --> 24:54.527
Sorry, FB.

24:54.561 --> 24:55.662
I've been snapping at everyone,

24:55.695 --> 24:57.664
especially Valencia.
Hmm.

24:57.697 --> 25:00.667
(whispers):
I even turned down sex.

25:00.700 --> 25:03.269
Wow.

25:03.302 --> 25:05.004
Josh, that's a big "wow"
for you.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.674
I didn't even know men
were capable of doing that.

25:07.707 --> 25:11.243
Well, they... they are.

25:12.979 --> 25:14.847
Oh, duh. I'm sorry.
Mm-hmm.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.215
Eh, it's okay,
sometimes I forget, too.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.550
Can you identify

25:17.584 --> 25:19.051
the moment

25:19.085 --> 25:21.988
that you became so upset?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.290
It was at...

25:24.323 --> 25:26.693
Home Base.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.160
Greg made me upset.

25:28.194 --> 25:29.295
Okay. In what way?

25:29.328 --> 25:31.097
He was just being
a big dumbface.

25:31.130 --> 25:32.665
Why does Rebecca like him?

25:32.699 --> 25:33.833
Why is she all buddy-buddy
with him?

25:33.866 --> 25:35.101
He's just a stupid know-it-all.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.903
He's also your best friend.

25:36.936 --> 25:39.706
Right? I mean, what did Greg
do that made you so frustrated

25:39.739 --> 25:42.308
other than befriend Rebecca?

25:43.342 --> 25:45.077
I don't know.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.846
What do you think?

25:46.879 --> 25:49.115
Well, can I be honest?

25:50.182 --> 25:51.851
I think you're acting like

25:51.884 --> 25:53.252
a little bitch right now.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.987
Whoa! Dude!

25:55.021 --> 25:57.323
Josh, you kissed Rebecca,
but then you chose Valencia.

25:57.356 --> 25:59.859
And now you can't let go
of Rebecca's attention

25:59.892 --> 26:03.129
and adoration, and that's why
you're jealous of Greg, dude.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.164
And that's how you're
acting like a little bitch.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.800
Okay?
If Rebecca

26:07.834 --> 26:10.069
seems happy,
you got to bow out, dawg.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.904
Let it be.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.306
You're all up in someone else's
beeswax right now.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.175
(sighs)

26:17.877 --> 26:19.946
It's your move.

26:22.148 --> 26:23.783
It's your checkers move.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.352
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.087
Mm-hmm.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.122
*

26:31.891 --> 26:34.761
Mmm. Oh, my God,
I was so hungry.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.830
Here, have the
last lettuce cup.

26:37.864 --> 26:40.066
Really?

26:40.099 --> 26:42.068
You love handheld salads.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.137
You said that you're still
hungry and it looks delicious.

26:45.171 --> 26:46.839
And you remembered?

26:46.873 --> 26:48.074
You just said it.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.309
I know, but...

26:50.342 --> 26:52.411
you're really sweet.

26:52.444 --> 26:55.381
Like...

26:55.414 --> 26:58.084
you're just...

26:58.117 --> 27:01.353
you're the sweetest.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.723
What do you say

27:03.756 --> 27:06.392
we break the sexual tension...

27:06.425 --> 27:08.427
with some actual sex?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.663
(chuckles)
O... Okay.

27:10.697 --> 27:11.898
Yeah.
Yeah?

27:11.931 --> 27:13.099
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, wait,

27:13.132 --> 27:15.968
how is your, um... situation?

27:16.002 --> 27:17.970
Oh, fine.

27:18.004 --> 27:19.972
Don't worry about it.
Yeah.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.008
*

27:26.913 --> 27:30.783
* You've been tearing me up
for a week and a half *

27:30.817 --> 27:33.920
* I don't mean like
in my heart *

27:33.953 --> 27:35.454
* I mean, physically

27:35.487 --> 27:37.790
* You've been tearin' me up

27:37.824 --> 27:41.227
* It's D-Day in my lady parts

27:41.260 --> 27:43.195
* But as I'm beggin' for more

27:43.229 --> 27:45.097
* Writhing around on the floor

27:45.131 --> 27:46.866
* I feel something deep inside

27:46.899 --> 27:49.335
* I never felt before

27:49.368 --> 27:52.872
* Oh, my God,
I think I like you *

27:52.905 --> 27:56.142
* Oh, my God, I think
I like you *

27:57.877 --> 28:01.313
* It's scary but you send me
back on my heels *

28:01.347 --> 28:03.482
* 'Cause while
I'm getting spanked *

28:03.515 --> 28:06.118
* I can't ignore the feels

28:06.152 --> 28:07.720
* But I say

28:07.754 --> 28:10.757
* No, no, no,
this is just about sex *

28:10.790 --> 28:14.226
* And no, no, no,
don't be such a girl, Becks *

28:14.260 --> 28:18.130
* But then I feel the oxytocin
creeping back to my brain *

28:18.164 --> 28:21.433
* And all I can do
is sing it again *

28:21.467 --> 28:22.902
* Oh, my God

28:22.935 --> 28:25.905
* I think I like you

28:25.938 --> 28:28.775
* Why can't I just focus on
getting a pounding? *

28:28.808 --> 28:32.278
* On the bidness
goin' on near my thighs? *

28:32.311 --> 28:34.146
* But as my body's
getting ruined *

28:34.180 --> 28:36.215
* Like, really trashed

28:36.248 --> 28:39.418
* I only want
to look in your eyes *

28:39.451 --> 28:41.420
* But then I'm upside down

28:41.453 --> 28:43.956
* Next to my kitchen sink

28:43.990 --> 28:45.925
* And suddenly it's like,
oh, my God *

28:45.958 --> 28:48.928
* I think I like you

28:48.961 --> 28:52.198
* Oh, my God,
I think I like you *

28:54.333 --> 28:58.070
* My feelings
get stronger every day *

28:58.104 --> 28:59.872
* I'm like a little girl

28:59.906 --> 29:02.208
* Not in a role playing way

29:03.509 --> 29:07.479
* Are there condoms
that can prevent these feelings?

29:07.513 --> 29:10.082
* Is there
spermicidal lubricant *

29:10.116 --> 29:11.317
* That can kill

29:11.350 --> 29:14.921
* The fluttering in my heart?

29:14.954 --> 29:17.456
* Is there an IUD

29:17.489 --> 29:19.792
* That can stop the image of

29:19.826 --> 29:21.460
* You and me

29:21.493 --> 29:23.796
* Getting married
on a hillside *

29:23.830 --> 29:25.064
* Surrounded by ducks

29:25.097 --> 29:27.466
* And then we get
into a rowboat? *

29:27.499 --> 29:31.170
* Oh, my God,
I think I like you *

29:31.203 --> 29:34.106
* Oh, my God, I think
I like you *

29:35.507 --> 29:39.478
* But I say no, no, no

29:39.511 --> 29:42.214
* No, no, no

29:43.916 --> 29:45.918
* No, no, no

29:47.854 --> 29:50.522
* No, no, no.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.524
(sighs)

29:54.560 --> 29:56.328
(gasps)

29:56.362 --> 29:57.329
What's wrong?

29:57.363 --> 29:59.531
I got to go. I got to
break into a pie shop.

29:59.565 --> 30:00.967
What?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.969
Good-bye.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.537
Cool, see you.
I'm gonna nap now.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.577
(dog barking in distance)

30:11.610 --> 30:13.279
I'm here, I'm here,
I'm here.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.114
You're late.
I have been standing

30:15.147 --> 30:17.216
in front of this stupid
pie shop for 20 minutes.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.450
I know. I'm so sorry.

30:18.484 --> 30:19.952
Why do you smell like spit?

30:19.986 --> 30:21.988
No I don't. It's
not spit. What?

30:22.021 --> 30:24.957
Okay, I feel stupid
in these outfits.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.192
No, you love our
stalking outfits.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.593
You always say how
slimming they are.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.328
Yeah, but we're stalking pastry,
and it's just...

30:29.361 --> 30:30.562
it's not sexy.

30:30.596 --> 30:33.866
Oh, my God, stop ruining
this. Just come on.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.868
(sighing)

30:35.902 --> 30:37.904
Come on!

30:39.038 --> 30:41.040
Okay.

30:52.418 --> 30:55.087
Oh, damn it.
Oh, no, I really have to pee.

30:55.121 --> 30:57.289
Well, can't you hold it?

30:57.323 --> 30:59.992
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course,
I'm sorry. I...

31:00.026 --> 31:03.495
I drank a lot of water before
this because I was nervous.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.231
Uh, okay.

31:08.634 --> 31:09.835
Look at that,

31:09.868 --> 31:12.304
look at that. She's totally
adding something to the crust.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.907
Look.
(gasps) She is
doing something secretive.

31:14.941 --> 31:16.342
She has a secret
ingredient of some kind.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.978
I knew it, I knew it.

31:19.011 --> 31:21.447
But what is...
You think it's extra sugar?

31:21.480 --> 31:23.149
It's lard?

31:23.182 --> 31:24.917
Heroin?

31:24.951 --> 31:26.518
You never know.

31:29.421 --> 31:30.957
The second she's gone,
we're going in.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.158
Okay.

31:32.191 --> 31:33.359
Oh!

31:35.661 --> 31:38.197
(whispering):
Okay...

31:38.230 --> 31:40.466
(British accent):
the coast appears to be clear.

31:40.499 --> 31:43.402
Awesome.
Let us retrieve
the package.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.604
Okay, I will stay here
and be the lookout.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.306
Okay. Great.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.208
All right.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.210
What's...
what are you doing?

31:51.243 --> 31:52.544
Rebecca, what
are you doing?

31:52.578 --> 31:54.613
Just in case there are lasers.

31:54.646 --> 31:57.383
There aren't...
That's so stupid.

31:57.416 --> 31:58.650
Oh, wait. I have an idea.

31:58.684 --> 31:59.952
What?

31:59.986 --> 32:01.487
Okay. Watch this.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.654
No, no.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.523
No, no, d...
Please don't touch the...

32:04.556 --> 32:06.725
(exhales sharply)

32:06.758 --> 32:08.460
Okay, we are good on lasers.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.196
Right. Great.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.599
I don't know.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.467
What if it's booby-trapped?

32:15.501 --> 32:16.602
It's a refrigerator.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.537
Just... open the door,
Tom Cruise.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.239
You're just, like,
no fun right now.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.740
(sighs)

32:21.773 --> 32:23.109
All right.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.144
(sings quietly):
* Ah...

32:25.177 --> 32:27.446
(singsongy):
All right, I got it.

32:29.348 --> 32:31.383
Did you just pee yourself?

32:33.085 --> 32:34.586
I have two kids.
I know that face.

32:34.620 --> 32:35.654
No, it's fine.
It's just a little squirt.

32:35.687 --> 32:37.656
My pants got most of it.
Catch this!
Wait. Oh.

32:37.689 --> 32:40.426
Okay. Come on.

32:40.459 --> 32:41.427
Okay. Heee!

32:41.460 --> 32:42.428
No, you don't have to...

32:42.461 --> 32:43.695
All right,
you know what?

32:43.729 --> 32:45.164
(sighs heavily)
(clattering)

32:49.301 --> 32:50.169
Okay.

32:50.202 --> 32:53.505
(sighs) We've got
the secret ingredients,

32:53.539 --> 32:55.641
so let's figure out
what it is.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.543
You want to Bunsen burner
that thing? Ooh.

32:57.576 --> 32:59.745
Better yet, I have a
centrifuge I bought in
Colonial Williamsburg

32:59.778 --> 33:01.480
when I was 12--
I've never used it,

33:01.513 --> 33:03.249
but I brought it
to West Covina.

33:03.282 --> 33:05.384
Okay, maybe... Or just
taste it, just taste it.
Okay.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.419
*

33:08.787 --> 33:11.357
It's...

33:11.390 --> 33:13.159
Yeah, it's unsalted butter.

33:13.192 --> 33:14.360
Whoa!

33:14.393 --> 33:16.795
Is that common?
I don't cook.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.098
Yeah. No, everybody uses it.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.666
She's just a better
baker than me.

33:20.699 --> 33:23.369
(chuckles): And, you know,
that's no secret.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.204
I don't know what
I was thinking.

33:25.237 --> 33:26.405
It's okay.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.508
You know what?
Screw this.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.111
(sighs) You don't need
a secret ingredient.

33:32.144 --> 33:34.813
Right? Just like we don't
need a secret ingredient.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.415
We've been having
so much fun

33:36.448 --> 33:38.417
without talking
about you know who,

33:38.450 --> 33:40.252
and it's been amazing--
because it doesn't matter

33:40.286 --> 33:42.488
what we do, as long
as we do it together.

33:42.521 --> 33:43.355
So...

33:43.389 --> 33:45.757
forget all I was
saying about winning,

33:45.791 --> 33:48.294
and let's just have
fun and bake a pie.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.163
Okay.

33:52.698 --> 33:54.233
Okay.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.402
You know, you're right.
You are right.

33:56.435 --> 33:57.836
Let's do this.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.670
Yeah.

33:58.704 --> 33:59.805
Okay.
Hey, boob five.

33:59.838 --> 34:00.806
Oh, yeah.
(grunts)

34:00.839 --> 34:03.175
Wow, just... every time.
Sorry, they're heavy.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.712
(dog barking in distance)

34:06.745 --> 34:08.746
(TV playing indistinctly)

34:10.882 --> 34:13.185
Hey, I had a thought.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.786
Hmm?
Um...

34:15.821 --> 34:17.755
I was thinking that
tomorrow night...

34:17.789 --> 34:20.226
you know, before...
pound time,

34:20.259 --> 34:23.629
um... I don't know, that we
could go to this drive-in

34:23.661 --> 34:25.431
in Alhambra.

34:25.464 --> 34:29.467
I-I read that they're
showing Casablanca, and...

34:29.501 --> 34:31.637
I just thought it would
be fun for you and I

34:31.670 --> 34:33.705
to spend some... you
know, time together

34:33.739 --> 34:35.706
in an outdoor setting.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.708
Or indoors. I mean,
cars are indoors and...

34:37.743 --> 34:40.312
You get what I'm saying?
Yeah, sounds like
a great idea.

34:40.346 --> 34:41.513
Yeah?

34:41.547 --> 34:43.514
Oh, wait, tomorrow night?

34:43.549 --> 34:45.751
Yeah, do you have work?

34:45.784 --> 34:48.387
Do you have,
like, a hot date?

34:50.489 --> 34:53.225
Wait. Seriously, you do?

34:53.259 --> 34:55.327
You do.
Oh, well, not exactly.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.329
Hec-Hector wants me
to meet this girl...

34:57.363 --> 35:00.132
Uh-huh, and you said yes?

35:00.166 --> 35:03.602
W-Well, I haven't said
anything either way...

35:03.635 --> 35:05.171
yet.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.506
Uh-huh.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.841
But you didn't say
no right away.

35:09.875 --> 35:12.511
Given our history,
I thought I should at least...

35:12.544 --> 35:14.646
consider it.

35:16.582 --> 35:18.617
Yeah. (laughs)

35:18.650 --> 35:20.419
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.621
I-I... Absolutely.

35:22.654 --> 35:24.656
Yes, you should
go on the date.

35:24.690 --> 35:27.626
We are...
not exclusive.
Hmm.

35:27.659 --> 35:28.860
Um... I mean,

35:28.894 --> 35:31.430
totally, I myself
have, like, um...

35:31.463 --> 35:34.666
eight dates lined
up next week.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.202
Eight?

35:36.235 --> 35:38.504
Yeah. I got a
matinee one day.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.772
I'm, like, on a, um,
Broadway schedule.

35:40.806 --> 35:44.243
Oh. Okay, that's cool.

35:44.276 --> 35:46.378
Mm. Mm.

35:47.579 --> 35:50.316
(smacks lips)
So...

35:50.349 --> 35:53.252
you have a...

35:53.285 --> 35:54.653
great date.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.188
Okay, I will.

35:56.222 --> 35:57.923
And you...

35:57.956 --> 36:01.260
break a leg?

36:01.293 --> 36:03.295
Yeah. Cool.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.565
*

36:13.305 --> 36:14.673
(sighs):
You know...

36:14.706 --> 36:17.676
I think this pie
could actually take the cake.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.811
First place is a cake.
It's weird.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.280
Mm-hmm.
You okay?

36:21.313 --> 36:22.581
Yeah. Sorry.
Feeling a little weird.

36:22.614 --> 36:23.949
Just, like, a little
weird. I'm fine.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.284
Okay.
Yeah.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.455
Mmm...

36:31.357 --> 36:33.459
Yup, good mouth feel.

36:33.492 --> 36:35.461
Mm-hmm, it's got a nice,
flaky under-crust.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.463
I'm getting lime,
I'm getting cardamom,

36:37.496 --> 36:39.431
I'm getting
just a note of cheddar.

36:39.465 --> 36:41.367
Also...
You just fill out
a card, sir.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.269
Oh. Sorry.

36:47.339 --> 36:48.840
Ooh, what do we

36:48.874 --> 36:50.809
have here? Ooh...
Lemon meringue!

36:50.842 --> 36:51.977
(singsongy):
Sebastian.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.345
(chuckles)

36:53.379 --> 36:54.613
For me? Thank you.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.482
Mmm...

36:57.549 --> 36:58.917
Mmm...

37:00.519 --> 37:02.988
Oh, damn it-- that woman
is a pastry witch.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.456
Ow.

37:04.490 --> 37:06.358
Do you need to sit down?

37:06.392 --> 37:07.926
No. No, no, no.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.595
I'm fine.

37:09.628 --> 37:10.862
Okay.

37:10.896 --> 37:13.031
You know, I'm so glad
we did this together.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.500
You were right about us.

37:15.534 --> 37:16.835
Yeah.

37:16.868 --> 37:17.903
DARRYL:
Hello, ladies.

37:17.936 --> 37:19.738
I will not be greeting you
by name,

37:19.771 --> 37:21.773
not will I be looking you
directly in the eyes,

37:21.807 --> 37:23.475
for I am impartial.

37:23.509 --> 37:25.010
(whispers):
I am so voting for you ladies.

37:25.043 --> 37:27.613
I love you guys so much.
I love you both a lot,

37:27.646 --> 37:29.915
and I love Paula's pies,
and I just feel so inspired

37:29.948 --> 37:31.650
WOMAN: Who's next?
by your friendship every day.

37:31.683 --> 37:34.286
Judges!
Yes, well, I am ready now

37:34.320 --> 37:37.589
to sample Paula's
Pretty Pecan Pie, if I may.

37:37.623 --> 37:40.459
Sebastian, for you.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.494
Thank you.
Mmm...

37:44.796 --> 37:46.665
Mmm...

37:49.568 --> 37:51.670
Mmm.... mmm...

37:51.703 --> 37:52.971
Oh...
Mmm...

37:53.004 --> 37:54.540
Oh, my God, they love it.

37:54.573 --> 37:56.608
(sighs, whispers):
Rebecca, they love it.

37:57.676 --> 37:58.944
(Rebecca thuds)

37:58.977 --> 38:01.046
Oh, my God!

38:01.079 --> 38:03.915
Honey, what's wrong?
(groans)

38:04.950 --> 38:07.453
HECTOR:
Yo, Greggy!

38:07.486 --> 38:09.388
Over here.

38:11.823 --> 38:14.760
This is Angie.
Nice to meet
you, Greg.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.728
And this is
her cousin Brandy.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.397
Hello, Brandy.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.098
Hi, Greg. I've heard
a lot about you.

38:20.131 --> 38:23.335
(phone chimes)
Well, I hope it wasn't all...

38:23.369 --> 38:25.871
*

38:25.904 --> 38:27.873
I'm sorry, I need to go.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.107
Nice meeting you.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.410
(awkward chuckle):
B-Bro, so rude.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.944
Is it Rebecca?

38:32.978 --> 38:34.680
I'm sorry. She needs me.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.815
Dude. If you go
now, you're done.

38:36.848 --> 38:38.950
You'll never get
the upper hand again.

38:43.989 --> 38:46.592
Well, I guess we'll just have
to have a threesome.

38:46.625 --> 38:48.594
Really?

38:48.627 --> 38:50.562
No. She's my cousin.

38:50.596 --> 38:52.130
Gross.
Ew.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.899
(awkward chuckle)

39:01.440 --> 39:02.808
Everything's gonna be okay,
cookie.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.411
I am right here.

39:05.444 --> 39:06.111
Oh!

39:06.144 --> 39:08.414
And I forgot to tell you we won!

39:08.447 --> 39:11.817
Yeah. Just as they were
dragging your little body away,

39:11.850 --> 39:13.018
they-they announced...

39:13.051 --> 39:16.555
Paula's Pretty Pecan Pie won!

39:16.588 --> 39:18.724
(sighs)

39:18.757 --> 39:22.127
Oh, my poor, sweet,
innocent little thing, wha...

39:22.160 --> 39:23.795
what happened to you?

39:26.765 --> 39:28.800
What are you doing here?

39:28.834 --> 39:30.536
Rebecca texted me.
Is she okay?

39:30.569 --> 39:33.171
I'm-I'm waiting for the doctor.
Why'd she text you?

39:33.204 --> 39:34.072
Paula, I came as soon as

39:34.105 --> 39:35.874
I got your text.
Ah, you told Josh to come.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.743
That makes sense.
Wh-What's wrong with her?

39:37.776 --> 39:39.044
Is she okay?

39:39.077 --> 39:40.779
Doctor, what's wrong
with my cookie?

39:40.812 --> 39:44.149
I don't know what's wrong
with your cookie, but hers
is a mess. (laughing)

39:44.182 --> 39:46.017
I'm sorry, that
was inappropriate.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.854
It's her peehole
that's been destroyed.

39:49.855 --> 39:50.989
What?

39:51.022 --> 39:53.058
She has a UTI and
didn't take any meds,

39:53.091 --> 39:55.894
so the infection went
to her kidneys and...

39:55.927 --> 39:58.396
(imitates explosion)
Man down!

39:59.230 --> 40:00.966
You're a colorful doctor.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.835
Thank you. I am taking standup
classes at Claremont at night

40:03.869 --> 40:06.171
when my wife is working.

40:06.204 --> 40:09.074
I'm pretty alone at night.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.177
A UTI.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.244
(breathy laugh)

40:13.278 --> 40:15.881
So you are sleeping
with someone. I knew it!

40:15.914 --> 40:18.049
And after you
specifically

40:18.083 --> 40:19.184
swore that you weren't!

40:19.217 --> 40:20.752
God, we don't keep secrets!

40:20.786 --> 40:22.020
They have
boundary issues.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.122
Hey, we don't keep
secrets,

40:24.155 --> 40:26.191
and we don't lie
to each other, okay?

40:26.224 --> 40:28.794
We've discussed it,
and we don't do it.

40:28.827 --> 40:31.697
Sleeping with someone?
Who is Rebecca sleeping with?

40:31.730 --> 40:33.965
(chuckles): Yeah! That's
what I would like to know.

40:40.672 --> 40:43.842
Uh, I sense a truth bomb coming.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.977
Everyone take cover.

40:47.546 --> 40:49.748
Uh, yeah, it's me.
(sighs)

40:49.781 --> 40:50.582
No.

40:50.616 --> 40:51.550
Yeah.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.084
No.

40:53.118 --> 40:54.953
No, it can't be you.

40:54.986 --> 40:55.854
It's definitely me.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.823
It's not you.
She told me it wasn't you.

40:57.856 --> 40:58.924
It can't be you.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.860
You're sleeping
with Rebecca?
All the time. A lot.

41:01.893 --> 41:05.096
It's Greg? It's Greg?
You're sleeping with Greg?!

41:05.130 --> 41:07.799
(inhales sharply)

41:12.704 --> 41:14.239
*

41:14.272 --> 41:16.074
Rebecca?

41:21.279 --> 41:23.815
How could you?

41:23.849 --> 41:26.718
*

41:29.555 --> 41:30.856
Lot of differences
between men and women.

41:30.889 --> 41:32.658
Lot of differences,
lot of differences.

41:32.691 --> 41:35.093
As a doctor, I notice
a lot of differences,

41:35.126 --> 41:36.161
a lot of differences.

41:36.194 --> 41:38.597
Hey, you ever notice how
when a male patient dies,

41:38.630 --> 41:40.599
he's all like...
(flatlining tone)

41:40.632 --> 41:42.568
but when a female patient dies,

41:42.601 --> 41:44.603
she's like, "Beep, beep, beep!"

41:44.636 --> 41:46.137
(chuckles)
