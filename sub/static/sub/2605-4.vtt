WEBVTT

02:02.956 --> 02:05.374
Hey. I thought I saw you sneak in.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.044
- You look nice.
- Thanks. So do you.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.754
Oh, yeah. I was at a party at Bloomberg's.

02:09.963 --> 02:13.007
But you came here to be with
your News Night family at midnight.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.550
Well, near them, anyway.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.678
- Can I ask a favor?
- Yeah.

02:17.763 --> 02:20.807
Can Wade have two minutes with you?
He's got some facts he wants to share.

02:20.891 --> 02:21.891
Sure.

02:22.518 --> 02:24.477
- You don't mind?
- No problem.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.191
Wade?

02:32.444 --> 02:33.778
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

02:34.238 --> 02:37.073
Oh, and Jim's putting together
the packet of stories you asked him to.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.658
You want to give it
five minutes a night next week?

02:38.742 --> 02:39.951
Let's look at the stories first.

02:40.035 --> 02:42.370
Done. I'll leave you guys alone.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.291
- How have you been?
- I've been good, thanks.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.377
- And I appreciate you taking a minute.
- What can I do for you?

02:49.962 --> 02:52.338
You know I'm an assistant US attorney
for the southern district, right?

02:52.422 --> 02:53.422
Yeah.

02:53.632 --> 02:57.260
Well, right now,
my job's prosecuting financial crime.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.387
Well, you know, Wade,
feel free to start any time.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.430
You've been pretty rough on us.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.016
Countrywide?
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.227
You've got guys flooding the market
with bad mortgages,

03:06.311 --> 03:08.938
lying to investors, making billions of dollars,

03:09.022 --> 03:11.190
but most incredibly, discussing it by e-mail.

03:11.275 --> 03:14.443
I don't mean to insult you, man,
but how do you not get a fraud conviction?

03:14.987 --> 03:19.282
Right there's what I'm talking about.
This is the half of the story you're leaving out.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.035
- Are you ready for me to blow your mind?
- Sure.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.328
- Bigfoot's real.
- No, it's not.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.205
- Did you say...
- Bigfoot is real.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.291
- No, it's not.
- Listen to me, skeptismo.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.043
There are 1.7 million known species
on the planet,

03:31.128 --> 03:33.045
and biologists estimate this represents

03:33.130 --> 03:35.965
only a quarter of the total species
on the planet.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.466
The other three quarters are microscopic.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.218
- How do you know?
- I don't know.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.888
But if the other three quarters were bigfoot,
they wouldn't be hard to see.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.848
They'd be walking up and down the street.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.100
We're gonna step slowly away now.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.227
Don't mention this to anyone
unless you know them really well.

03:48.312 --> 03:49.562
And even then.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.814
Pandas were thought to be a myth until 1869.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.984
Gorillas were thought to be a myth until 1902.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.778
The giant squid was thought to be a myth
until 2004.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.448
- What's up?
- Maggie, listen to me.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.783
Apex predators,
species at the top of the food chain,

04:02.868 --> 04:05.703
have the smallest numbers
and move in the tiniest packs.

04:05.787 --> 04:06.996
Is this bigfoot?

04:07.080 --> 04:09.790
Species diversity is greatest
in the rain forests.

04:09.875 --> 04:12.376
Stop. Just don't even... Stop.

04:12.461 --> 04:13.669
What are you doing?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.339
Trying to work.

04:17.299 --> 04:19.175
Do you see there's a party
happening around you?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.259
I'm okay.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.803
Sometimes it's hard to tell
who the biggest nerd in the office is.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.514
Could there be an apex predator primate...

04:25.599 --> 04:26.849
Not today, though.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.018
Kaylee!

04:29.519 --> 04:30.686
You guys haven't met Kaylee yet.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.438
Is this a new girlfriend?

04:32.522 --> 04:34.523
- Girlfriend's a strong word.
- Really?

04:35.525 --> 04:37.318
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

04:39.071 --> 04:40.321
- Get me drunk.
- Done.

04:40.906 --> 04:41.906
Boom!

04:44.785 --> 04:46.702
- Come on, join the party.
- I will.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.371
I just want to finish this for Will.

04:48.705 --> 04:49.705
What is it?

04:49.790 --> 04:53.501
Stories we missed this year
or didn't give enough attention to.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.796
- Want some help?
- Sure.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.341
Yeah, take this stack here
and anything you think is...

05:00.425 --> 05:03.052
- Anything we missed.
- Or didn't give enough attention to.

05:03.887 --> 05:07.098
Bigfoot's real
and I don't think anyone reported it.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.766
- Hey, Don.
- Circle it.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.062
You look really nice tonight.

05:14.606 --> 05:15.606
Yeah?

05:16.066 --> 05:19.944
God, definite... Yes. Yeah. Definitely.

05:21.113 --> 05:24.323
Yeah, I don't mean to be...

05:24.408 --> 05:26.993
Shoot, Don's here.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.578
- I'm sorry.
- It's no problem. I was almost done.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.666
Well, don't, you know...
Take a couple hours off.

05:34.876 --> 05:35.918
I will.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.547
Will you? 'Cause it's a party.
Have you ever been to one?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.425
I have been to over three of them.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.094
Maggie.

05:45.804 --> 05:46.804
See you later.

05:54.688 --> 05:57.565
- Oh, man. Look at you.
- You look at me.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.859
I had to get a crew off the clock.
Did I miss anything?

05:59.943 --> 06:03.571
Neal won't rest
until he gets Will to do a story on bigfoot.

06:03.655 --> 06:06.323
- Did bigfoot do something?
- Bigfoot can't do anything. He's not real.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.200
That's what they said about
the moon landing.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.535
I believe you've had a cocktail.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.787
Men have cocktails.
Carrie Bradshaw has drinks.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.623
- Nope, the other way around.
- Doesn't matter. I'm fun Don tonight.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.917
I love fun Don.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.878
- Where have I seen this dress before?
- On Lisa.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.547
- She let me raid her closet.
- I think you should never take it off.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.591
Except when you take it off.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.551
Now, speaking of your roommate,
I had a great idea.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.428
- Soundproofing her bedroom?
- Fixing her up with Jim.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.599
Are you kidding?

06:31.767 --> 06:32.892
I feel like I owe him one.

06:33.185 --> 06:37.229
Then why would you unleash Lisa on him?

06:37.314 --> 06:39.231
- They'll get along.
- She works in a boutique.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.567
- Here she is. Lisa.
- Wait, don't.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.693
This is the worst fix-up ever.

06:42.778 --> 06:44.487
I'm not talking about having him take a bride.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.781
- I'm talking about starting off the new year...
- Getting him laid.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.657
- With a bang.
...with a bang. See what I did?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.118
Hey.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.079
- You made it.
- Yeah.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.206
Am I wearing a huge sign
that says, "Dateless on New Year's Eve"?

06:55.290 --> 06:57.208
No, but that dress sends a message
loud and clear.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.292
Do I look slutty?

06:58.502 --> 07:00.169
- Absolutely. In the best way.
- No. Don!

07:00.420 --> 07:02.004
I wasn't going for slutty. I was going for...

07:08.929 --> 07:10.846
I like Rod Stewart.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.431
Yeah. So, I've got a guy for you.

07:12.516 --> 07:13.557
- No, you don't.
- A guy here?

07:13.642 --> 07:14.767
- Yeah.
- No.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.811
Is it another loser that doesn't have a date
on New Year's Eve?

07:16.895 --> 07:18.187
- He's not a loser.
- Yes, he's a huge loser.

07:20.690 --> 07:22.733
- What the hell is going on?
- What the hell is going on?

07:23.610 --> 07:26.278
She works in fashion, Don. No offense, Lis.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.780
I don't even know
what I'm supposed to be offended by.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.157
But I can talk about other things.
I don't have to talk about fashion.

07:30.242 --> 07:31.450
- I know you can.
- Give me a topic.

07:31.701 --> 07:32.993
What's happening with the Greek debt crisis?

07:33.537 --> 07:35.579
There's a huge crisis in Greece.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.498
- They're in a lot of debt.
- See?

07:37.874 --> 07:39.542
- Are you serious?
- That's more than most people know.

07:39.835 --> 07:40.793
You see the guy over there?

07:40.877 --> 07:43.254
The cute, sweet-looking puppy dog guy
with the stupid look on his face?

07:43.338 --> 07:44.296
He is cute.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.215
- Why is he working?
- He has a job.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.218
So right there,
he's a leg up on your usual diet.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.929
His name's Jim Harper.
He's a senior producer.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.639
He's a bright guy.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.975
He's not the creative director
for an imaginary Internet start-up.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.059
He calls his mother...

07:57.144 --> 07:59.311
I'm sure he's nice,
but I don't think I'm in the mood for a fix-up.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.354
Why not?

08:00.438 --> 08:01.689
I don't know,
I'm just coming off a relationship.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.066
Of 10 days. I've bought milk
before your relationship started

08:04.151 --> 08:05.442
that was still good to drink after it ended.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.486
- I don't think so.
- It's true. I can show you the milk.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.822
- She doesn't need to be fixed up, honey.
- I didn't say that she needed to be.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.323
It's 10 minutes before midnight.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.450
No guy wants to be fixed up
10 minutes before midnight.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.537
Besides, I'm not his type. I can tell.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.622
You're everybody's type.
You're the girl next door. Let's go.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.291
Next door to what?

08:21.418 --> 08:24.253
- Jimmy Olsen.
- That nickname's really gonna stick, huh?

08:24.337 --> 08:27.506
It has endured. It's a compliment.
Jimmy Olsen was a go-getter.

08:27.591 --> 08:30.092
Yeah, but strictly speaking,
he was a photojournalist.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.844
In fact, when DC Comics first introduced...

08:31.928 --> 08:34.722
Yeah, shut up.
This is Maggie's roommate, Lisa.

08:34.806 --> 08:37.183
- Oh, hey. It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.310
- I've heard a lot about you.
- I've heard a lot about...

08:39.394 --> 08:43.898
Not a lot, but Maggie's...
She's mentioned you once, I think.

08:45.275 --> 08:48.194
Lisa went to Parsons and she works
at a very high-end boutique in the Village.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.278
Nice.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.821
So why don't you take Lisa out
onto the terrace

08:50.906 --> 08:52.531
where you can watch
one million people in Times Square

08:52.616 --> 08:54.408
waiting for the world's biggest nonevent?

08:54.492 --> 08:57.077
Maggie and I are going to get some drinks,
and we'll meet you out there.

08:57.162 --> 08:59.413
- Jim has to work.
- Not at 11:50 on New Year's Eve.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.539
Grab some coats.

09:02.626 --> 09:03.709
- Tess.
- Yeah?

09:03.793 --> 09:06.045
- Kill me. Kill me now. Do it now.
- Huh?

09:09.382 --> 09:12.593
Congress cut our investigations
to 20% of what they promised.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.887
We were supposed to get 165 million.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.806
But after rolling over to the GOP,
they only gave us 30.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.391
- How's it going in here?
- Good.

09:19.476 --> 09:23.103
Wade says the House cut 80% of the
DOJ's budget to fight financial crime.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.271
He was just telling me.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.398
For every one of me
the Justice Department can hire,

09:26.483 --> 09:30.194
the banks can hire 20
and afford to stay in litigation forever.

09:30.278 --> 09:32.321
You think Big Tobacco throws money
at this shit?

09:32.656 --> 09:36.951
Meet Goldman, meet Lehman,
meet B of A and meet Countrywide.

09:37.327 --> 09:40.788
Honey, are you saying the United
States of America is getting out-lawyered?

09:40.872 --> 09:42.748
Don't call him "honey." It makes me crazy.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.167
I didn't say that.
It came out of my mouth. Just words.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.505
Yes, we are getting out-lawyered.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.050
That is a story we're missing.
Let me talk to Mac a second. All right?

09:53.134 --> 09:54.343
Great.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.678
- I'll be outside.
- Great.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.394
You can't have your boyfriends
lobbying me to go easier on them.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.146
Hang on, he wasn't lobbying
for you to go easier. He was pitching a story.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.773
I've got a staff of paid professionals
to do that.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.733
Mostly by using inside sources like Wade.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.194
And it's not boyfriends. It's one boyfriend.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.655
- So he's your boyfriend?
- I guess he is.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.532
- I mean, that's what you call him?
- I call him "Wade."

10:16.950 --> 10:19.451
- When you introduce him, do you say...
- Yes!

10:19.536 --> 10:22.121
How do you introduce the Netflix queue
of crazy divorced women

10:22.205 --> 10:24.790
with digitally re-mastered breasts
you spend your nights with?

10:24.874 --> 10:26.959
- You see anyone with me right now?
- Of course not.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.627
If you'd asked someone out
on New Year's Eve,

10:28.712 --> 10:30.296
that would mean
you were in a real relationship.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.464
Oh, please, tell me more
about real relationships.

10:32.674 --> 10:35.718
- I'm not keeping myself in jail anymore.
- What does that mean?

10:35.969 --> 10:38.887
He's my boyfriend. We're serious.
I want a partner.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.473
That is so romantic. I'd set it to music.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.976
- Look...
- I'm glad you're letting yourself out of jail.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.061
- I meant...
- You owe it to yourself.

10:53.445 --> 10:56.030
Congress defunded the DOJ
on financial crime.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.698
I thought you'd want to hear that.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.033
I did.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.411
Come on out to the party.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.371
I will.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.124
All right.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.858
Fuck it.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.121
- Nice tux.
- I just came from a different party.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.539
Was it good?

11:47.624 --> 11:49.249
Have you ever been
to a good New Year's Eve party?

11:49.334 --> 11:50.334
No.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.795
I've never enjoyed myself on December 31 st.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.046
No one ever has.

11:54.130 --> 11:56.715
I can tell you for me,
there was this one time in 10th grade...

11:56.800 --> 11:58.717
No, this is my thing I'm talking about now.

11:58.802 --> 12:01.470
Okay. Why don't you talk to someone?

12:01.763 --> 12:03.639
I don't need a therapist,
I just don't like New Year's Eve.

12:04.099 --> 12:08.727
No, I'm saying why don't you go up to
someone here at the party and talk to them?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.230
- Do people really do that?
- Talk to people?

12:11.314 --> 12:13.690
- Just walk up to them.
- I've seen it on TV.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.068
That woman over there,

12:16.152 --> 12:19.363
she's obviously here alone,
and I'm getting a good feeling about her.

12:19.906 --> 12:23.325
You have good instincts about these things?
I'm opening up to you. I'm not good at this.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.037
That's really sweet, Will.
You should let more people...

12:27.163 --> 12:28.330
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what do I do?

12:29.541 --> 12:32.167
Walk up to her and introduce yourself.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.836
- I'm gonna do it.
- You should.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.254
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- Talk to her.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.089
- I'm going.
- Okay, but you're still standing here.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.258
- Here I go.
- Haven't moved.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.384
Shut up.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.515
Hi. Excuse me.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.560
- Am I in your way?
- No, I just wanted to introduce myself.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.186
I'm Will McAvoy.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.480
I know that. I'm Nina Howard.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.317
I don't know what to do now.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.821
- Did you come over to talk to me?
- Yes.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.240
All right.

13:03.825 --> 13:04.867
How'd you get in here?

13:06.369 --> 13:08.954
I'm a friend of one of the producers
on ACN Morning.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.998
- Day side. Uh-oh.
- Oh.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.959
- Day side and prime time don't get along?
- Jets and the Sharks.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.129
Well, maybe we could be like Tony and Maria.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.716
Why is Will talking to Nina Howard?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.510
- You know who she is?
- She's a gossip columnist for TMI!

13:23.595 --> 13:25.762
- Oh, he shouldn't be talking to her.
- I know. Why is he?

13:26.431 --> 13:28.640
- I may have suggested it.
- Why?

13:28.725 --> 13:30.434
You were here with Wade
and he seemed lonely...

13:30.518 --> 13:31.685
Excuse me.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.313
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.397
Hi.

13:35.565 --> 13:37.483
I'm so sorry. Can I talk to you a moment?

13:37.567 --> 13:38.817
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.652
She wants to warn you that
I'm a gossip columnist.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.738
Oh, that's not it. I promise.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.284
- She's a gossip columnist.
- No, she writes features.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.369
TMI! Had Jennifer Aniston
on the cover this week.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.580
You know who they had last week?
Jennifer Aniston.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.790
- You know who they had the week before?
- Are you a subscriber?

13:53.875 --> 13:55.167
They have it at my nail place.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.919
- Oh! Do you go to Cuti-cles?
- Yes.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.504
- Ba-Ling?
- Yes.

13:58.588 --> 13:59.755
- I'm walking away from this.
- No, Will.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.673
Yeah, my instincts may have been wrong.

14:01.758 --> 14:03.759
It's New Year's Eve.
I don't care if she writes for Mein Kampf.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.599
Really? You're setting up my boyfriend?
Not my boyfriend. Just words.

14:10.683 --> 14:11.683
- Hi.
- What about your boyfriend?

14:12.143 --> 14:13.435
Hey, handsome.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.479
Nice.

14:15.563 --> 14:19.191
You know,
it's only a few minutes before midnight.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.360
Yeah, we've got clocks everywhere.

14:21.444 --> 14:25.948
So, I say you kiss me at midnight,
and we see what happens from there.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.909
I'm gonna start to walk up to people more.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.496
I got you a drink.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.873
- Now you seem lonely and broken to me.
- I do?

14:34.958 --> 14:36.291
But don't worry, I can fix you.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.504
Well, if there's one thing a man likes,
it's a woman who tries to fix him.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.756
What are you working on right now?

14:42.840 --> 14:44.299
A piece on Brittany Giancarlo.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.928
- I don't know who that is.
- Brittany Giancarlo?

14:48.012 --> 14:50.514
She's the young one
on Real Housewives of New Jersey.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.474
Oh, I've got them all TiVo'd, but I haven't...

14:52.559 --> 14:54.226
She's a drunk gold digger

14:54.310 --> 14:56.895
who's probably cheating
with her yoga instructor.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.690
- And why are you writing about her?
- I just told you.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.192
No, I mean, sure, but what did she do?

15:02.485 --> 15:03.986
Nothing, it's just a takedown piece.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.404
A what?

15:05.488 --> 15:09.116
A takedown piece. I'm gonna take her down.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.784
Why?

15:10.868 --> 15:13.036
'Cause that's what you do
in a takedown piece, genius.

15:13.371 --> 15:15.497
Nine, eight...

15:16.249 --> 15:18.875
- You actually call it a "takedown piece"?
- Yeah.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.212
Four, three, two, one!

15:22.463 --> 15:24.590
Happy New Year!

15:31.180 --> 15:33.557
- Hang on.
- What?

15:34.726 --> 15:37.102
You're just setting out to be mean
to somebody?

15:37.186 --> 15:39.354
- And this was going so well.
- No, it could still go well.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.231
Not if you're going to give me
a condescending lecture.

15:41.316 --> 15:42.691
I think we both know
that's what's going to happen.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.111
Didn't I just spend the last six months
watching you take down the Tea Party?

15:46.195 --> 15:47.779
Okay, first, thanks for watching.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.240
Second, I obviously didn't take them down.
They won.

15:50.408 --> 15:53.035
Third, the fact that they did
is an enormous danger

15:53.119 --> 15:55.120
- to A, a great political party...
- Oh, there's subheadings?

15:55.204 --> 15:56.955
...of which I happen to be a member,

15:57.040 --> 15:59.458
and B, an enormous danger to everyone
who lives in this country.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.834
- Mmm-hmm. Fourth?
- Fourth...

16:00.918 --> 16:05.130
These are people
who are asking for our votes.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.633
You and I do the same thing for a living.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.760
That's nuts, Nina.

16:09.844 --> 16:13.055
I try to expose the truth about things
that are of national importance.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.973
Well, I'm trying to expose the truth

16:15.058 --> 16:18.101
about the fact that Brittany might have
had a daughter when she was a teenager,

16:18.186 --> 16:20.812
who's now 10 possibly
and being taken care of by her mother.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.648
Why is that the concern of anyone
except for Brittany?

16:22.732 --> 16:25.525
It's not a concern. It's entertainment.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.402
Okay, well, here's the thing,
though, it shouldn't be.

16:28.571 --> 16:29.905
- Is that right?
- Of course it's right.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.074
You know it's right.
You know right from wrong.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.325
Everybody said you were like this.

16:33.743 --> 16:35.243
No, no, look. You can be part of the change.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.370
You don't have to write gossip.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.122
I work for a gossip magazine.

16:39.207 --> 16:41.917
Are we gonna go back to flirting,
or are you gonna keep putting me down?

16:42.126 --> 16:43.168
I'm not putting you down.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.712
I'm just saying that what you do
is a really bad form of pollution

16:45.797 --> 16:48.507
that makes us dumber and meaner
and is destroying civilization.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.343
I'm saying, with all possible respect,

16:51.427 --> 16:54.513
that I would have more respect for you
if you were a heroin dealer.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.099
And I'm speaking professionally,
not personally.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.061
Okay, Will.

17:01.145 --> 17:06.274
I'm speaking personally when I say fuck you.
And you just passed up a sure thing.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.193
- Come on, hear me out.
- Don't touch me.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.654
The real lives of people
shouldn't be used as entertainment.

17:10.738 --> 17:11.947
- You can turn this thing around.
- I'm not interested.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.991
- What do you think he's doing?
- Trying to civilize her.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.786
That's not gonna work out well.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.997
Hang on, looks like it's coming any second.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.166
...that you're on right now.

17:23.918 --> 17:24.960
There it is.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.383
- Will.
- Yeah?

17:31.467 --> 17:33.677
I just wanted to introduce my friend, Kaylee.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.303
- I'm a huge fan.
- Thank you.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.266
I hate to bother you,
but do you have a second?

17:39.350 --> 17:41.226
I've got all the time in the world, Neal.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.895
All right, um, bigfoot is real.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.690
- Let me start...
- Get the hell away from me.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.067
- No problem. Sorry. Come on.
- Okay.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.094
- Yeah?
- Have you read the New York Post?

18:16.387 --> 18:17.929
No, my eyes are connected to my brain.

18:18.181 --> 18:20.515
I'm not sure about that.

18:20.600 --> 18:26.438
Let's open to Page Six,
which for some reason is on page 10,

18:26.522 --> 18:27.731
and see what we find.

18:28.191 --> 18:30.108
The headline, "Anchor Rancor."

18:30.193 --> 18:32.110
- Anchor anchor?
- Anchor Rancor.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.820
- Anchor anchor.
- Rancor.

18:33.905 --> 18:36.031
Anchor Rancor.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.450
Subheader,
"Will McAvoy gropes in the New Year."

18:38.534 --> 18:39.618
What?

18:39.702 --> 18:42.579
"ACN's newly minted liberal bloviator

18:42.663 --> 18:44.790
"made a scene at
a private New Year's Eve party

18:44.874 --> 18:48.293
"at which our spies caught
the reengineered lefty firebrand

18:48.377 --> 18:52.130
"making a drunken pass
at TMI! Reporter Nina Howard."

18:52.215 --> 18:53.215
Whoa, Nelly!

18:53.466 --> 18:58.053
"But the Tea Party foe got a face full of bubbly
instead of what he was looking for.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.140
"McAvoy was wearing
a $4,000 custom-made tuxedo

19:02.225 --> 19:03.683
"and a dumb look on his face."

19:03.768 --> 19:06.061
There are a couple of factual errors
in that story.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.771
Please let there be more than a couple.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.981
First of all, I'm a registered Republican.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.650
I only seem liberal because I believe

19:11.734 --> 19:13.485
that hurricanes are caused
by high barometric pressure

19:13.569 --> 19:14.986
and not gay marriage.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.447
Second, I wasn't making a pass at her.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.574
I was rejecting a pass from her

19:19.659 --> 19:22.536
while trying to talk her out of doing what
they call at TMI! A takedown piece

19:22.620 --> 19:24.246
of one of the
Desperate Housewives of New Jersey.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.831
- Real Housewives.
- Who gives a shit?

19:25.915 --> 19:28.250
- Definitely not me.
- And the tuxedo's off the rack.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.503
- Did you grope her?
- No! I...

19:31.587 --> 19:36.716
I gently touched her to block her
as she was coming in for a kiss.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.552
I blocked her.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.346
I was the victim of
an unwanted sexual advance.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.265
But more important,
I was fighting the good fight.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.267
Why were you fighting any fight?

19:45.351 --> 19:47.269
I was trying to get her to not write
the takedown piece.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.478
- Why?
- Why?

19:48.563 --> 19:50.939
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you why.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.816
Because I'm on a mission to civilize.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.526
- How's it going so far?
- Progress is slow,

19:54.610 --> 19:56.111
but I'm in it for the long haul.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.989
You want Publicity to draft a statement?

19:59.073 --> 20:00.365
- About the mission?
- The Page Six piece.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.200
- Absolutely not.
- Good.

20:02.285 --> 20:04.286
- What did you call me up here for?
- Mostly to laugh at you.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.497
But I also wanted to share an observation.

20:07.582 --> 20:08.832
- Go.
- You're dating.

20:09.125 --> 20:11.418
I am. I've decided to live my life as if I'm alive.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.420
I am all for it.

20:13.504 --> 20:17.173
But I've noticed that the women you date
all have one thing in common.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.383
I am a leg man.

20:18.467 --> 20:22.554
No, these are all women who,
in a million years,

20:22.638 --> 20:24.973
you would not want to spend
any daylight hours with.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.099
What do you make of that?

20:27.143 --> 20:28.935
You're asking out the wrong women.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.770
- I'm not an elitist.
- Be one.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.108
No comment on this shit, Charlie.
I'm not kidding.

20:35.192 --> 20:38.153
And I'd also like to know who at my party
was tipping Page Six.

20:38.279 --> 20:41.031
- I'll launch a full-scale investigation.
- Thank you.

20:41.115 --> 20:42.198
How much was the tux?

20:43.326 --> 20:46.578
It was... It was like... It was 4,000 bucks.

20:53.544 --> 20:56.338
Now!

21:01.302 --> 21:02.427
What's happening now?

21:02.929 --> 21:06.348
In this order, Tess, Tamara, Gary,

21:06.432 --> 21:11.144
Maggie, Kendra, Martin, Neal and Jim
thought it would be funny.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.021
- And you?
- Peer pressure.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.524
I didn't grope anybody.

21:16.734 --> 21:19.945
I was holding her at bay while I clarified...
It doesn't matter.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.322
I'm on a mission to civilize. I'm Don Quixote.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.657
I'm Don Quixote.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.200
Have you even read Don Quixote?

21:25.284 --> 21:27.911
- In the original French.
- It was written in Spanish.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.372
Not my copy. I could have read it in Spanish?

21:30.456 --> 21:31.539
You could have read it in English.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.959
Well, there's a year and a half of my life
I'm not getting back.

21:34.251 --> 21:37.087
Sit down. All right.

21:37.171 --> 21:40.632
Jim was working all New Year's Eve
on stories we either missed

21:40.716 --> 21:43.051
or didn't pay enough attention to in 2010.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.387
Not all New Year's Eve.
He found some time to take a little break.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.888
- Pardon?
- Nothing.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.307
We'll do five minutes a night
every night this week.

21:49.392 --> 21:52.352
I've boiled them down to these and, Will,
you can boil them down to what you want.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.354
I'm out there on the front lines
fighting for civility.

21:54.563 --> 21:55.730
You picked her up at a party.

21:56.023 --> 21:58.066
I didn't pick her up. I walked up...

21:58.150 --> 21:59.901
And can I say in my defense,
did you see her legs?

22:00.236 --> 22:01.403
All right, that'll do.

22:01.904 --> 22:03.822
First up, the Chilean miners.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.199
We stuck with the Christine O'Donnell debate
in Delaware

22:06.283 --> 22:07.659
instead of cutting away to the rescue.

22:07.743 --> 22:09.869
I'll let everyone know
that they came out all right.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.621
You're the one who wanted these.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.373
- Next?
- Next.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.625
I wouldn't mind following up
on the bribery charges

22:15.710 --> 22:17.585
- Nigeria filed against Cheney.
- Next.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.171
Conflict of interest with Virginia Thomas
and the voicemail message...

22:20.256 --> 22:21.548
- Next.
- Tess?

22:22.967 --> 22:24.676
- Now I'm frightened to say it.
- Say it.

22:25.386 --> 22:28.596
May 27, the iPad was released.
Lines went around the block...

22:28.889 --> 22:30.473
- Get the hell out of the meeting.
- Yeah.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.727
- Sit down.
- Where are the real ones? The lies. Lies.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.896
Why doesn't the news ever call a lie a lie,
but we know it's a lie?

22:37.898 --> 22:39.524
Jim, Maggie.

22:39.608 --> 22:42.652
It was during the week of the midterms,
so we were doing other things,

22:42.737 --> 22:46.031
but the idea that Obama spent
$200 million a day on a trip to India

22:46.115 --> 22:47.323
is still in the water supply.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.493
- We could deconstruct how that happened.
- Sold. What else?

22:50.786 --> 22:52.120
- Guns.
- What about them?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.955
Everyone from Wayne LaPierre to Glenn Beck

22:54.040 --> 22:55.790
is shouting that Obama is coming
to get our guns

22:55.875 --> 22:57.542
when there's no evidence to suggest

22:57.626 --> 22:59.878
that Obama's the least bit interested
in our guns.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.087
Show me the lack of evidence and I'm in.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.300
- Anything else?
- Yes.

23:07.011 --> 23:09.554
I don't know how else to say this.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.431
- Bigfoot is...
- Great.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.142
Not because they don't want
to limit your rights,

23:14.727 --> 23:17.854
but because they're afraid
of the political consequences.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.064
Coming back to you, Will.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.356
Don't doubt for a minute

23:20.441 --> 23:22.817
that if they thought they could
get away with it,

23:23.277 --> 23:25.028
they would ban guns and ban ammunition.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.446
Stand by, 177.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.490
That was former governor Sarah Palin

23:28.574 --> 23:31.367
speaking to the National Rifle Association
last year.

23:31.452 --> 23:33.536
Here's Fox News host Glenn Beck
on the same subject.

23:33.621 --> 23:34.913
Go, 177.

23:34.997 --> 23:37.749
He will slowly but surely

23:37.833 --> 23:39.000
- take away your gun.
- Stand by, 178.

23:39.752 --> 23:44.047
And here's NRA executive vice president
Wayne LaPierre speaking at CPAC,

23:44.131 --> 23:46.132
- the Conservative Political Action Conference.
- Go, 178.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.803
But it's a big, fat, stinking lie.

23:50.513 --> 23:55.183
Just like all the other lies that have come out
of this corrupt administration.

23:56.811 --> 23:57.977
It's all part...

23:58.145 --> 24:02.315
Would you put this guy on a list
of the top 10 craziest people in politics?

24:02.399 --> 24:03.817
That's a tough list to crack.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.611
Yeah, I know this looks like
a big, juicy rib-eye to you,

24:06.695 --> 24:09.906
but show some restraint now
and let the facts speak for themselves.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.951
- Any other tips?
- Try not to get distracted by his legs.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.162
- Here we go.
- That's their agenda.

24:17.248 --> 24:18.623
And radio host Rush Limbaugh

24:18.707 --> 24:21.417
has repeatedly warned to his listeners
to go out and buy guns

24:21.544 --> 24:24.546
before President Obama outlaws them all.
The result?

24:25.172 --> 24:28.133
In November 2008,
the month Mr. Obama was elected,

24:28.300 --> 24:31.136
there was a 42% spike
in gun background checks

24:31.220 --> 24:33.513
as compared to the same month
the year before.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.099
- Stand by, G-17 through 22.
- The country's largest anti-gun lobby

24:36.183 --> 24:38.810
is called the "Brady Campaign
to Prevent Gun Violence,"

24:38.894 --> 24:42.147
named for James Brady,
President Reagan's press secretary

24:42.231 --> 24:43.356
who was shot in the head

24:43.440 --> 24:46.484
during John Hinckley's assassination attempt
on the 40th president.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.946
The Brady Organization gives grades
to elected officials

24:50.030 --> 24:53.032
based on their record and
leadership with regard to gun legislation,

24:53.117 --> 24:55.869
with an A being the most anti-gun and so on.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.122
In spite of Governor Palin, Glenn Beck,
Rush Limbaugh

24:59.206 --> 25:02.333
and the Director of the NRA
telling us emphatically

25:02.418 --> 25:05.253
that Barack Obama has a secret plan
to get our guns,

25:05.337 --> 25:06.754
here's the president's report card.

25:07.464 --> 25:10.049
Background checks? F. Gun trafficking? F.

25:10.301 --> 25:14.429
Guns in public? F.
Federal assault weapons ban? F.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.849
Standing up to the gun lobby? F.

25:18.017 --> 25:19.851
Not only has no attempt
whatsoever been made

25:19.935 --> 25:21.394
to dismantle the Second Amendment

25:21.520 --> 25:24.063
during Barack Obama's
first two years in office,

25:24.148 --> 25:25.773
the President has signed into law

25:25.858 --> 25:29.319
more repeals of federal gun policies
than George W. Bush did

25:29.403 --> 25:31.321
during his entire eight years
in the White House.

25:31.906 --> 25:34.824
In fact, these grades would indicate
that President Obama

25:34.909 --> 25:38.203
is the best friend the NRA
has ever had in elected office,

25:38.287 --> 25:39.621
to say nothing of the Oval Office.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.874
Why are Sarah Palin,
Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh

25:42.958 --> 25:45.877
and the head of the NRA
so colossally lying to you?

25:45.961 --> 25:47.128
I don't know.

25:47.922 --> 25:52.842
But I know when they do, ratings go up,
political contributions go up,

25:52.927 --> 25:57.555
membership in the NRA goes up,
the President's approval rating goes down

25:57.640 --> 26:00.850
and gun sales go through the freaking roof.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.019
- We'll be right back.
- Cue music.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.155
You'll need to get used to dating a guy
who gets off work at 9:00.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.658
Hey, not dating. One date.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.284
- No, stop it.
- Maggie, I'm not...

26:18.369 --> 26:20.119
- It's fine.
- It's not in the vicinity of fine.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.663
Listen to me. This is crazy.

26:21.747 --> 26:24.249
- I agree.
- Nope, keep listening.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.542
I have a boyfriend who I love,

26:26.627 --> 26:30.463
and I should have fixed you up with Jim
a long time ago.

26:30.547 --> 26:32.298
- Even if that were true...
- It is true.

26:32.383 --> 26:33.883
- Even if it was... Even if...
- It is. It...

26:34.009 --> 26:35.843
- Let me talk!
- Sorry.

26:38.514 --> 26:39.555
- He's...
- But it is.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.349
He's gonna think I'm dumb.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.105
No, he's not. Who told you that?

26:47.189 --> 26:50.358
No, he's not. Lis, you're not dumb.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.152
Look at me. You're not dumb.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.489
You go out with guys
who make you feel dumb.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.449
And Jim's not like that.

26:58.534 --> 27:00.201
That's one of the things that makes him...

27:03.205 --> 27:04.205
Trust me.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.667
I've never been on a date with him,
but I imagine...

27:08.544 --> 27:10.378
You imagine what and how often?

27:10.462 --> 27:13.673
That it would be fun is all I was gonna say.

27:15.009 --> 27:16.718
You're not dumb.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.306
I'm just nervous.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.975
I know. Your skirt's on backwards.

27:25.227 --> 27:27.937
Damn it. And this is my field of expertise.

27:28.022 --> 27:29.397
Yeah.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.784
Oh! Oh, my God. I'm freezing.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.536
I've got a real fireplace with real fire.

27:43.620 --> 27:47.081
You do? Well, what about
some dry clothes I can change into?

27:47.541 --> 27:50.293
Take whatever you want in the bedroom.
It's right around the corner.

27:51.462 --> 27:53.004
Not the yellow taffeta sundress.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.631
This is your fault.

27:55.716 --> 27:57.425
I'm not the one who said,
"Let's walk off dinner."

27:57.509 --> 27:59.635
I had to walk off dinner
because you made me order

27:59.720 --> 28:02.055
the $135 macaroni and cheese.

28:02.139 --> 28:05.975
I really wanted to see what
a $135 macaroni and cheese looked like.

28:06.060 --> 28:08.186
- This is a fun date.
- It is.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.355
And it's the same as
Stouffer's macaroni and cheese

28:10.439 --> 28:14.150
with $134 worth of shaved truffles on top.

28:14.234 --> 28:17.070
Sloan said you were fun.
Hey, do you like to get high?

28:17.154 --> 28:21.824
I used to, but I can't buy pot anymore
without it showing up in a newspaper.

28:21.909 --> 28:23.659
There's a joint in the side pocket of my purse.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.495
Get it out.

28:26.663 --> 28:28.122
All right.

28:41.470 --> 28:43.179
- Carrie?
- Yeah?

28:44.848 --> 28:47.558
Can we talk about the gun
that's in your purse?

28:54.817 --> 28:57.235
I'm a southern liberal, dude.

28:57.319 --> 28:59.654
It's northern liberals
who are afraid of sex and guns.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.907
Well, both at the same time,
and I'm a Republican from Nebraska.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.659
But you mind if I...

29:09.164 --> 29:11.290
You're disarming. Get it?

29:11.458 --> 29:14.085
- Here's the thing...
- Yeah, yeah, I saw the show tonight.

29:14.169 --> 29:16.754
I'm a liberal's liberal. I worked for Hillary.
You were dead wrong on guns.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.590
I didn't take a position on guns.
I took a position on lying.

29:19.675 --> 29:20.675
I came out against it.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.427
Well, if I'm walking
the streets of Manhattan at night

29:22.511 --> 29:25.555
and a guy your size wants to rape me,
then this is gonna happen.

29:25.639 --> 29:28.391
Actually, statistics show
that this is gonna happen.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.397
Is it wrong that I'm turned on by that?

29:35.566 --> 29:36.691
Yes.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.278
- What'd you think of her?
- Yeah, what'd you think of her, Will?

29:43.824 --> 29:45.992
- She was packing heat.
- Didn't I tell you?

29:46.201 --> 29:47.577
No, Sloan, she was armed.

29:50.414 --> 29:54.917
...Waverly Inn to my apartment
with a loaded.38 caliber Walther PPK/S.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.545
- Are you going out with her again?
- No.

29:57.713 --> 29:59.422
- Oh, you have to.
- No, I don't think so.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.340
Thirty seconds. Get your mics on.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.718
No, she's gonna call me and call me
asking why you're not calling her.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.887
That would happen
after a second date, too, wouldn't it?

30:05.971 --> 30:09.265
Listen, just wait a while before you show up
again in Page Six with a different woman.

30:09.349 --> 30:11.976
She's super jealous.
You haven't seen the crazy side of her.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.895
You set me up with a crazy woman
who can shoot me.

30:13.979 --> 30:15.938
FatalAttraction with a concealed carry permit.

30:16.023 --> 30:17.899
- I'm tagging you back.
- That's totally fair.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.817
You're supposed to be the smartest person
on the staff.

30:19.902 --> 30:21.068
You have two PhDs.

30:21.153 --> 30:24.530
In economics.
This is an area where I do not excel.

30:24.615 --> 30:25.698
Oh, thanks for the heads up.

30:25.908 --> 30:27.617
In three, two...

30:29.745 --> 30:32.830
Terry Smith is coming up next
in Washington with The Capitol Report.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.749
I'm Will McAvoy. Good night.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.256
Good show, everybody.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.134
Good show.

30:45.219 --> 30:46.969
Yeah, I don't know.

30:47.054 --> 30:51.349
The economy,
we're still nibbling around the edges.

30:51.433 --> 30:53.184
We can't get it all done in one night.

30:53.268 --> 30:55.228
They're gonna rip Dodd-Frank limb from limb.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.688
I don't know how many more nights
we have left.

30:57.773 --> 31:00.566
Hey, speaking... Speaking of nights,

31:00.651 --> 31:03.611
I never asked...
I forgot to ask you how your date went.

31:05.948 --> 31:07.532
It went fine.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.369
Do you think you'll be seeing her again?

31:11.453 --> 31:13.788
- I don't think so.
- Why?

31:14.748 --> 31:16.707
Just one of those things.

31:16.792 --> 31:17.875
Not a love connection?

31:21.672 --> 31:24.507
Broccoli, and
combine cauliflower and string beans.

31:26.093 --> 31:29.720
- So, elephant in the room.
- Yeah.

31:29.805 --> 31:32.598
When I told my friend
I was going out with you tonight,

31:32.683 --> 31:34.600
she sent me Monday's Page Six.

31:34.685 --> 31:39.438
Okay, I met a woman named Nina Howard
at our New Year's Eve party.

31:39.523 --> 31:41.399
It turned out she writes for TMI!

31:41.483 --> 31:43.150
I asked her what she was working on,

31:43.235 --> 31:46.237
and she told me she was doing
what she called a takedown story.

31:46.321 --> 31:50.533
I'm on a mission to civilize, so I tried to
talk her out of it and she didn't take it well.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.868
- A mission to civilize?
- I walk a lonely road.

31:52.953 --> 31:55.997
What was the story she was doing?

31:56.623 --> 31:57.623
Um...

31:58.250 --> 32:02.420
Brittany DiFranklengonio
from the New Jersey... The Real Naked...

32:02.504 --> 32:04.422
- Wait, Brittany Giancarlo?
- That sounds right.

32:04.506 --> 32:07.216
She has a 10-year-old daughter
that she allegedly gave to her mother...

32:07.301 --> 32:08.301
Shut up.

32:09.678 --> 32:12.972
And they actually call it a takedown piece.

32:13.056 --> 32:14.432
That is so typically Brittany.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.142
Yeah, it is.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.560
She had a kid she gave up?

32:17.644 --> 32:20.521
I have no idea.
I don't even know if the kid is real.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.106
- What I'm talking about...
- I knew she was a liar

32:22.190 --> 32:24.275
when she didn't invite Wendy
to her game night.

32:24.359 --> 32:27.153
When she got busted,
she made everyone lie to cover her ass.

32:27.237 --> 32:28.904
- What kind of person does that?
- I don't know.

32:28.989 --> 32:33.159
Oh, and she's having an affair
with her yoga instructor.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.077
- My therapist told me that.
- Your therapist really...

32:35.162 --> 32:36.203
She knows I can keep a secret.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.456
She's an awesome judge of character.

32:38.540 --> 32:39.665
- Brittany?
- Your therapist.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.709
- 'Cause Brittany's a bitch.
- No, you are.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.546
Okay, let's hold it right there
and review the situation,

32:45.631 --> 32:47.632
because when I said "you,"
what I meant was "we."

32:47.716 --> 32:50.468
I meant I'm not concerned about Brittany.
She signed up for this.

32:50.552 --> 32:52.386
I'm concerned about the rest of us

32:52.471 --> 32:55.890
who are being turned into a bunch of
old ladies with hair dryers on our heads,

32:55.974 --> 32:58.309
gorging ourselves on the staged...

32:58.393 --> 33:00.645
It's just... God, it's so plainly bad, Monica.

33:00.729 --> 33:02.146
It's called a guilty pleasure.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.441
The chocolate soufflé on this menu
is a guilty pleasure.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.943
The Archies singing Sugar, Sugar
is a guilty pleasure.

33:08.028 --> 33:10.821
Human cockfighting makes us mean
and desensitizes...

33:10.906 --> 33:13.407
Wait, are you saying that
I'm mean and insensitive?

33:13.575 --> 33:15.451
You are a smart, accomplished woman.

33:15.535 --> 33:18.537
- You work for a US senator.
- Am I mean and insensitive?

33:18.622 --> 33:22.083
Yes, but thank goodness you met me in time.
Because now...

33:29.966 --> 33:32.927
I can't believe how often this is happening.

33:33.970 --> 33:37.682
He said he wasn't that into her.
Why are you so eager to make this happen?

33:37.766 --> 33:42.687
When did you get interested in Jim's life?
Or Lisa's life?

33:42.771 --> 33:45.439
I just asked how did the date go.

33:46.733 --> 33:47.942
But I'll tell you what's strange.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.485
- What?
- Jim's lying to you.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.196
About what?

33:52.280 --> 33:54.990
Lisa told me
they were going out again tonight.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.702
That's Lisa saying she's hoping
they go out again tonight.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.620
- Ah, I misunderstood.
- Yeah.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.580
Why would Jim lie about that?

34:01.665 --> 34:04.208
It's funny, I was wondering the same thing.
Why don't you give him a call?

34:04.292 --> 34:06.627
I'm not gonna call and check up on him.

34:06.712 --> 34:08.212
Then call him and tell him to look on Politico,

34:08.296 --> 34:10.923
'cause I'm reading that Spencer Bachus
told his hometown newspaper today

34:11.007 --> 34:14.677
- that Washington is there to serve the banks.
- Seriously?

34:14.761 --> 34:17.680
- Spencer Bachus is...
- I know. Is that a quote?

34:17.764 --> 34:20.683
"Washington is here to serve the banks."

34:20.767 --> 34:23.310
I actually do have to call Jim.
It's an economic story.

34:23.395 --> 34:24.979
That's what I'm saying.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.151
Can I see that?

34:31.611 --> 34:33.070
- Hello.
- Jim, it's me.

34:33.155 --> 34:34.530
- Yeah?
- Did I wake you up?

34:34.614 --> 34:36.282
No. Is everything all right?

34:36.366 --> 34:39.034
Go to Politico. The new Chairman of
the House Financial Services Committee

34:39.119 --> 34:43.080
told his hometown newspaper that
Washington is here to serve the banks.

34:43.165 --> 34:45.708
- Bachus?
- Yeah. Go to Politico and click on...

34:59.473 --> 35:01.766
- Jim?
- Yeah?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.896
You know, I'll talk to you in the morning.

35:10.525 --> 35:11.525
Something wrong?

35:15.947 --> 35:18.741
She should really change her ringtone.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.789
I can't believe what you just did.

35:27.876 --> 35:31.629
There is no way I'm the bad guy
in what just happened.

35:31.713 --> 35:33.547
At worst, I'm in fourth place.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.385
Have I done something wrong?

35:40.555 --> 35:41.722
No.

35:43.600 --> 35:44.892
Good.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.772
- "Serial Sleaze."
- I can explain this one.

35:49.856 --> 35:52.900
"Will McAvoy is making more news
when he's not behind his desk.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.193
"For the second time in a week,

35:54.277 --> 35:58.364
"the ACN anchor was humiliated by
a drink to the face from an unhappy date

35:58.448 --> 36:00.950
- "when the newly-come-liberal bachelor..."
- Registered Republican.

36:01.034 --> 36:04.411
"...stepped out with a bodacious blonde
for a late supper at the Mercer Kitchen.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.541
"The formerly vanilla host
of Atlantis Cable's flagship program,

36:08.625 --> 36:10.626
"who many believe has become unglued

36:10.710 --> 36:14.338
"since an appearance at the
Northwestern School of Journalism last April,

36:14.422 --> 36:16.006
"seems to like the ladies.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.718
"Unfortunately for McAvoy,
the ladies don't seem to like him back.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.513
"The kicker? Our spies tell us that McAvoy,

36:22.597 --> 36:25.432
"who's reported to earn
a mid-seven figure salary,

36:25.517 --> 36:26.559
"stiffed the waiter on his tip."

36:27.060 --> 36:29.270
Are you kidding? We didn't get past drinks.

36:29.437 --> 36:30.688
I threw $100 on the table.

36:30.772 --> 36:33.274
How much is a vodka martini
and a pomegranate cosmo?

36:33.483 --> 36:35.442
Please tell me it was you
who ordered the martini.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.777
Of course I was the one who... Yes.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.363
Look, she asked me about New Year's Eve,
I told her.

36:39.447 --> 36:43.117
And it turns out that she, too, really seems
to care about the life of Bethany...

36:43.201 --> 36:44.827
- Brittany.
...DiLaguardiosa.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.662
- No.
- How does it get in the paper so fast?

36:46.746 --> 36:47.997
God, these guys are good.

36:48.081 --> 36:50.541
Well, now we're putting out a statement.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.042
- No.
- Not from you.

36:52.127 --> 36:54.128
- From your spokesperson.
- Not from any person.

36:54.296 --> 36:58.674
Mr. McAvoy has been the victim of
a comical series of misunderstandings.

36:58.800 --> 37:01.218
No way.
However, I want to depose every waiter,

37:01.303 --> 37:04.680
bartender, doorman and valet
to whom I have ever given a tip.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.223
That might be unrealistic.

37:06.308 --> 37:08.517
I am beloved in the service industries.

37:08.602 --> 37:11.061
Hey, I've been meaning to ask you,
how's the dating going?

37:12.314 --> 37:13.314
You know what?

37:13.398 --> 37:15.482
How many women did you date
before you finally found the one?

37:15.692 --> 37:18.986
Doesn't matter how many I dated before.
I didn't date anyone after.

37:19.821 --> 37:21.739
It probably helped that
she didn't pull your heart out,

37:21.823 --> 37:24.825
throw it into an oven
preheated to 450 degrees,

37:24.910 --> 37:27.536
bake it in a light honey glaze
and serve it to you on a bed of rice.

37:28.413 --> 37:32.166
That's vivid, but you don't hold onto things.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.500
Why is it taking you so long to...

37:33.835 --> 37:36.754
Because it is.
It doesn't work like in the movies.

37:36.838 --> 37:38.547
It doesn't work at all.

37:38.632 --> 37:40.716
- How sure are you about that?
- Please.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.052
On the off chance that
you're not going to live forever,

37:43.136 --> 37:45.054
why not take a shot at being happy now?

37:46.264 --> 37:47.306
Can I go do the news?

37:48.224 --> 37:49.224
Yes.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.401
- Hey, stupid.
- Yeah?

38:00.195 --> 38:01.654
- What'd I say?
- When?

38:02.322 --> 38:04.990
I said don't show up in Page Six
with another date.

38:05.075 --> 38:07.576
- You think I phoned this in?
- Carrie is freaking out.

38:07.661 --> 38:09.203
- Who's Carrie?
- Two nights ago!

38:09.287 --> 38:10.496
Oh, God. What did she say?

38:10.580 --> 38:12.665
That you're a womanizing asshole,
and she hates you.

38:12.749 --> 38:14.917
I wasn't womanizing. I was dating.

38:15.001 --> 38:17.544
Well, William, she has a gun,
and she's going to shoot you.

38:18.254 --> 38:20.214
She's going to have to shoot you first, Sloan,

38:20.298 --> 38:21.715
because I'm going to use you
as a human shield,

38:21.800 --> 38:23.384
because you set me up with Annie Oakley.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.678
- You mean Ado Annie?
- I mean Annie Oakley.

38:25.762 --> 38:27.680
Annie Get Your Gun. Ado Annie's Oklahoma!

38:27.764 --> 38:30.391
- "I'm just a girl who can't say no."
- I can't help you anymore.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.643
Damn, 'cause your help's been invaluable
up till now.

38:32.811 --> 38:33.852
Hey!

38:36.648 --> 38:39.024
- Are you sure about Annie Get Your Gun?
- Yes.

38:40.402 --> 38:42.152
Back in 15 seconds, Will.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.488
Try not to date anyone
before you're on the air.

38:44.572 --> 38:47.324
Copy, Mac. Try not to sleep
with your ex-boyfriend while I am.

38:47.409 --> 38:48.826
In three...

38:48.910 --> 38:50.494
He got the better of that exchange.

38:50.578 --> 38:53.414
Mark Twain said
"A lie'll get halfway around the world

38:53.498 --> 38:55.207
"before the truth has time
to pull its boots on."

38:56.001 --> 39:00.462
That was literally the case in this story
we didn't pay enough attention to in 2010.

39:00.547 --> 39:03.090
President Obama was scheduled
to travel to Mumbai

39:03.174 --> 39:06.677
to meet with the Indian Prime Minister
about loosening US trade restrictions,

39:06.761 --> 39:12.141
a successful trip that would net our country
$10 billion in export deals and 50,000 jobs.

39:12.225 --> 39:15.144
And these overseas trips routinely cost
in the area of $5 million a day.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.312
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:17.397 --> 39:21.316
But on November 2nd of last year,
the website for New Delhi TV

39:21.401 --> 39:24.153
quoted an anonymous official
of the Maharashtra Government

39:24.237 --> 39:28.574
saying that President Obama's trip
would be costing $200 million a day.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.660
The Drudge Report posts a link to the story,

39:31.745 --> 39:34.413
either believing it to be possible
or not caring that it isn't.

39:34.956 --> 39:38.042
Rush Limbaugh knows this figure
can't possibly be right.

39:38.126 --> 39:40.919
But Mr. Limbaugh runs with it anyway.

39:41.004 --> 39:45.466
507 rooms at the Taj Mahal,
four... Forty airplanes,

39:46.009 --> 39:49.845
$200 million a day

39:49.929 --> 39:54.516
this nation will spend
on Obama's trip to India.

39:54.809 --> 39:57.519
In spite of there being no source
for this information,

39:57.604 --> 39:59.813
to say nothing of the absurdity of the figure,

40:00.482 --> 40:03.484
- Fox News grabs the baton.
- Ready, SOT one.

40:03.568 --> 40:06.445
So he's traveling with 34 warships,
an entourage...

40:06.529 --> 40:10.741
Oh, yeah, and he added 34 warships,
or 14% of the US Navy.

40:11.618 --> 40:16.705
So he's traveling with 34 warships,
an entourage of 3,000 people...

40:17.123 --> 40:18.123
Nope.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.334
He's staying at the Taj Mahal Hotel,

40:20.418 --> 40:23.212
which they have booked every single room in.

40:23.296 --> 40:28.175
And he's doing it, $2 billion for 10 days. Why?

40:29.010 --> 40:33.597
So on November 3rd, Matt Lehrich of
the Office of White House Media Affairs says,

40:33.681 --> 40:37.559
"The numbers reported in this article
have no basis in reality."

40:38.478 --> 40:41.730
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann,
founder of the Tea Party Caucus,

40:41.815 --> 40:44.775
who herself has a difficult relationship
with reality,

40:44.859 --> 40:47.486
ignores the statement from the White House.

40:47.570 --> 40:49.655
I think we know that just within a day or so,

40:49.739 --> 40:52.783
the President of the United States
will be taking a trip over to India

40:52.867 --> 40:57.121
that is expected to cost the taxpayers
$200 million a day.

40:57.747 --> 41:02.918
I think people who willfully, purposefully
and gleefully lie to the American people

41:03.002 --> 41:08.632
in order to damage someone's reputation
should, like a registered sex offender,

41:08.716 --> 41:12.928
be required by law to come with
that warning label for the rest of their lives.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.279
- Hello?
- Will, it's Charlie.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.531
I'm sorry to call early on a Saturday.

42:14.616 --> 42:17.326
- What happened?
- Can you come into the office at 11:00?

42:17.410 --> 42:20.162
- Yeah. What's going on?
- I'll see you at 11:00.

42:26.961 --> 42:28.712
Welcome back to Red Carpet Roundup

42:28.796 --> 42:31.965
where we continue our review
of last night's fashion winners

42:32.050 --> 42:34.468
and losers at the People's Choice Awards.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.595
We'll throw it back to our studio in Hollywood

42:36.679 --> 42:39.890
and Paulita Maya and her team
of fashion experts.

42:39.974 --> 42:41.391
Paulita?

42:42.393 --> 42:43.894
And we're clear.

43:03.998 --> 43:04.998
He's here.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.084
Against all instincts
of what sanity sounds like,

43:07.168 --> 43:09.086
I'm here at 11:00 on a Saturday.

43:09.170 --> 43:10.462
- You won't regret it.
- Too late.

43:11.381 --> 43:14.800
Thank you all for coming. Let me begin.

43:14.884 --> 43:17.344
There are 1.7 million known species.

43:17.428 --> 43:22.975
Biologists estimate this represents only
a quarter of the total species on the planet.

43:23.059 --> 43:29.731
Species diversity is greatest in rain forests,
and 75% of all species live in rain forests.

43:30.149 --> 43:35.696
So the argument is,
could there be an apex predator primate,

43:35.780 --> 43:38.782
a missing link, if you will,
between six and 10 feet tall,

43:38.866 --> 43:43.036
weighing up to 500 pounds that lives
in a dense temperate rain forest?

43:44.414 --> 43:46.123
- Jim?
- No. Is that it?

43:46.207 --> 43:48.667
Careful. Sometimes when Jim says no,
what he really means is,

43:48.751 --> 43:50.711
"I'm sleeping with your roommate."

43:51.421 --> 43:52.754
What's going on?

43:54.882 --> 43:56.425
I didn't know you were coming.

43:56.509 --> 43:57.801
- I was told to come.
- Really?

43:58.011 --> 43:59.386
Charlie called me at 7:00 this morning.

44:00.555 --> 44:01.680
I wonder how that happened.

44:01.764 --> 44:03.390
Was I called in on a Saturday for bigfoot?

44:05.059 --> 44:06.810
I think you're gonna find this interesting.

44:06.894 --> 44:08.729
I think you don't know what that word means.

44:08.813 --> 44:10.689
- What are you doing?
- You told me to come in.

44:10.773 --> 44:12.065
Not for this. What is this?

44:12.150 --> 44:13.734
I'm glad you asked, Charlie. Bigfoot is...

44:13.818 --> 44:15.402
Ah. Follow me.

44:18.031 --> 44:20.073
- I called you in for this.
- Oh, shit.

44:25.330 --> 44:26.788
We need a whole team for this?

44:27.707 --> 44:29.666
Don's a good advisor on damage control.

44:29.751 --> 44:31.752
- When's it come out?
- It's out. This is it.

44:31.919 --> 44:33.337
You keep guns in your house?

44:33.463 --> 44:34.713
Yeah, a vast collection.

44:34.797 --> 44:36.631
Sometimes to relax,
I go to the park and shoot dogs.

44:36.883 --> 44:38.884
- I'm just asking.
- She had the gun.

44:38.968 --> 44:41.928
Some crazy fucking friend of Sloan's.
I took out the bullets.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.555
The highest incidence
of bigfoot sightings

44:43.639 --> 44:45.515
have all come from
the temperate rain forest region

44:45.600 --> 44:48.685
that stretches from
Northern California to Alaska.

44:48.770 --> 44:52.147
Here we find local myths
like the Sasquatch and Ts'emekwes.

44:52.231 --> 44:54.399
Here we find local myths
like Jim not being a liar.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.443
Come with me, please.

44:56.527 --> 44:57.903
- I'm learning things.
- Now, please.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.789
First of all, you can't talk to me like that
in front of the staff.

45:09.082 --> 45:10.082
Oh, listen to Mr...

45:10.208 --> 45:11.375
- Mike.
- Yeah?

45:11.459 --> 45:12.542
You got the rest of the afternoon off.

45:12.627 --> 45:14.211
Maggie's taking your shift
on the assignment desk.

45:14.295 --> 45:15.670
- You sure?
- Go home.

45:15.755 --> 45:17.172
- Nice to throw your weight around?
- Yeah.

45:17.673 --> 45:20.217
Sit your ass at that desk until 4:00.
That's number one.

45:20.301 --> 45:24.805
Number two, I'm sorry that I lied to you.
I didn't want you to be upset.

45:25.223 --> 45:27.057
- Why did you think I'd be upset?
- Because you are!

45:27.141 --> 45:29.393
Not because you slept with Lisa,
because you lied about it!

45:29.477 --> 45:32.104
Excuse me! This isn't soundproof glass!

45:38.027 --> 45:39.694
It is because I slept with Lisa.

45:41.948 --> 45:44.157
You've never lied to me in all the time
we've been working together.

45:44.867 --> 45:48.578
Is that not a little bit...

45:48.663 --> 45:49.913
A little bit a good feeling?

45:50.665 --> 45:53.041
That it feels weird that I lied to you?

45:53.501 --> 45:59.005
And isn't it a little bit a good feeling
that my instinct was to lie?

46:01.384 --> 46:02.676
I have no idea what you're talking about.

46:04.220 --> 46:05.887
It was Don's idea to fix me up with Lisa, right?

46:06.597 --> 46:07.681
Yes.

46:07.807 --> 46:10.517
And Don was the one who called Lisa
when she was at my place?

46:12.270 --> 46:14.438
- Yes.
- Then I'd ask Don.

46:14.689 --> 46:16.356
'Cause he has every idea
what I'm talking about.

46:21.529 --> 46:23.613
I'm sorry I lied. It won't happen again.

46:36.294 --> 46:37.377
Did you know she was married?

46:37.462 --> 46:38.795
She's been separated for over a year.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.589
- Did you smoke pot with her?
- Yes.

46:40.882 --> 46:43.467
Did you level a.32 caliber gun at her head?

46:43.551 --> 46:45.051
I was demonstrating... Fuck this.

46:45.386 --> 46:47.137
You'd just done a gun rant that night.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.889
Is that what it was, Mac? It was a rant?

46:48.973 --> 46:50.140
Does she have
a text message from you?

46:50.600 --> 46:52.642
Listen to me. She got jealous 'cause she read

46:52.727 --> 46:54.478
that I went out with someone else
the next night.

46:54.562 --> 46:58.356
Then she went to Nina Howard at TMI!
Who was just waiting for a chance...

46:58.441 --> 47:00.025
I knocked Jennifer Aniston off the cover?

47:00.443 --> 47:03.695
This isn't funny, Will.
We're trying to do something here.

47:03.779 --> 47:04.988
All of us.

47:05.072 --> 47:07.866
There are guys in here on a Saturday doing...
What the hell are they doing?

47:07.992 --> 47:09.242
They're learning about bigfoot.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.328
Which, by the way,
is what used to be in the tabloids.

47:11.412 --> 47:13.038
Bigfoot and Elvis sightings
have been replaced...

47:13.122 --> 47:14.289
Whatever.

47:14.373 --> 47:17.000
We signed up with you and
no one's going to hear a word we're saying.

47:17.084 --> 47:18.835
- Tell me what I did wrong.
- How about drugs?

47:19.128 --> 47:20.670
I took a hit of a joint in my own home.

47:20.755 --> 47:22.881
- The text message.
- I'm not telling you what it says.

47:22.965 --> 47:24.591
Just tell me if you'd want
your mother to read it.

47:24.675 --> 47:27.177
Yeah, she died 10 years ago,
and I wouldn't mind seeing her again.

47:27.261 --> 47:29.638
Here's what we're gonna do.
You're gonna go on ACN Morning.

47:30.806 --> 47:33.308
They are going to ask
the questions we want them to ask

47:33.392 --> 47:34.809
and you're going to give
the answers we want...

47:34.894 --> 47:35.936
I'm not doing that.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.187
- Will.
- No, I'm not playing.

47:37.271 --> 47:40.273
This is News Corp using their gossip trash
to fuck with an anchor.

47:40.358 --> 47:43.193
News Corp doesn't own TMI! We do.

47:43.277 --> 47:46.863
- I'm talking about the Right coming after me.
- Wait.

47:46.948 --> 47:48.031
- I'm talking about...
- Wait!

47:54.455 --> 47:55.622
Wait.

47:57.083 --> 47:58.124
The tuxedo.

47:58.918 --> 48:01.586
The $4,000 tux.
You didn't buy it off the rack, did you?

48:01.963 --> 48:03.046
- What does...
- Just tell me.

48:08.344 --> 48:10.554
You're my boss and
I make a lot more money than you do.

48:10.638 --> 48:12.222
That makes me uncomfortable.

48:12.306 --> 48:15.183
- No, the tux was made for me by Armand...
- Armand Felini.

48:16.561 --> 48:17.894
Yeah, how did you know?

48:17.979 --> 48:21.022
'Cause Leona Lansing gave me
the same Christmas present last year.

48:22.066 --> 48:26.403
A custom-made tuxedo from Armand Felini.

48:26.487 --> 48:30.198
This isn't News Corp. It's us.

48:31.826 --> 48:33.118
It's AWM.

48:35.538 --> 48:38.623
That's how Nina Howard knew
how much the suit cost.

48:41.043 --> 48:42.168
Why would our parent company...

48:42.253 --> 48:47.382
I had a meeting I never told you guys about
the day after election night.

48:50.344 --> 48:52.721
Leona's really pissed that
you're shooting at Tea Party congressmen

48:52.805 --> 48:55.599
and senators she has to do business with.

49:00.646 --> 49:01.688
How pissed?

49:03.441 --> 49:07.611
I'm not asking him to lie.
I'm not asking him to cover anything up.

49:07.695 --> 49:09.946
But he's gonna tone it down or I'll fire him.

49:10.031 --> 49:12.866
Well, best of luck trying
to program against him.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.285
I won't have to.

49:15.369 --> 49:17.704
He's got a non-compete clause
in his contract.

49:17.788 --> 49:20.957
- He's got to stay off television for three years.
- That's a death sentence.

49:21.292 --> 49:22.709
It is.

49:23.294 --> 49:29.090
How would you possibly explain firing
the second most watched anchor on cable?

49:29.175 --> 49:32.469
By creating what we call a context.

49:32.553 --> 49:34.471
His firing would be viewed
as an honorable step

49:34.555 --> 49:38.475
by a corporation willing to sacrifice
ratings for integrity.

49:39.393 --> 49:41.102
How could you not tell me
about that meeting?

49:41.187 --> 49:42.479
I should have.

49:42.563 --> 49:43.897
- You think?
- I should have.

49:43.981 --> 49:46.149
This is a huge line that's being crossed.

49:46.233 --> 49:47.859
- I made that clear to her.
- A huge...

49:47.943 --> 49:49.653
How many times in the last six months
have I asked

49:49.737 --> 49:51.112
if we're all right on the 44th floor?

49:51.197 --> 49:55.575
Will, I love you, but you've got clay feet,
and I needed to keep you in the chair.

49:55.660 --> 49:56.910
Thanks for the confidence.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.328
Can we get back to damage control?

49:58.412 --> 50:00.330
- ACN Morning Monday.
- Hang on.

50:01.916 --> 50:04.209
You'd never allow a non-compete clause
in your contract.

50:04.293 --> 50:06.127
You couldn't stay off the television
for five minutes.

50:06.212 --> 50:08.254
It got put in.

50:08.714 --> 50:09.923
When?

50:13.094 --> 50:14.302
When, Will?

50:17.848 --> 50:19.474
When I renegotiated my contract.

50:19.558 --> 50:21.685
To be able to fire me at the end of each week.

50:22.603 --> 50:23.603
Yeah.

50:34.156 --> 50:36.991
- Jesus Christ, how much do you hate me?
- I don't hate you.

50:37.076 --> 50:39.619
You allowed a non-compete clause
in your contract?

50:39.704 --> 50:42.872
Three years? You were willing to stay off TV
for three years?

50:43.290 --> 50:45.208
When was the last time an anchor
stayed off TV for three years

50:45.292 --> 50:46.543
and ever came back?

50:47.044 --> 50:50.880
Have revenge sex with every woman
in the Tri-State area, for all I care,

50:50.965 --> 50:53.091
but keep it out of the goddamn newspapers.

50:53.467 --> 50:55.427
- Some of us have moved on.
- Yeah, you mentioned that.

50:55.511 --> 50:58.430
I can leave. You can do the same show
with another producer.

50:58.514 --> 50:59.681
We can have that discussion.

50:59.890 --> 51:01.015
- Why don't we have it now?
- Yeah.

51:02.226 --> 51:04.936
Yeah, some of us moved on
three and a half years ago

51:05.020 --> 51:06.479
and forgot to tell me!

51:11.152 --> 51:12.652
Uh...

51:13.821 --> 51:17.115
The vast majority of this rain forest
is unexplored

51:17.199 --> 51:18.992
despite almost 100 years
of commercial logging.

51:20.161 --> 51:23.997
I would add that renowned primatologist
Jane Goodall is also a believer,

51:24.081 --> 51:27.250
given the cryptozoological history
of the lowland gorilla.

51:27.334 --> 51:31.504
But she's not alone in this scientific field.
Due to frequent yeti sightings...

51:41.098 --> 51:42.140
Heads up!

51:44.769 --> 51:46.144
- What's going on?
- All hands!

51:46.228 --> 51:47.437
There's been a shooting in Tucson

51:47.521 --> 51:49.981
and a congresswoman, Gabrielle Giffords,
has been shot in the head.

51:50.065 --> 51:51.357
This is Martin at the ACN newsroom.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.401
I was wondering if you have a comment
on the shooting?

51:53.486 --> 51:54.527
Get me our Tucson affiliate.

51:54.779 --> 51:58.156
It's Charlie Skinner. New York Control
is breaking in in 15 minutes.

51:58.365 --> 51:59.449
- Tess!
- Yeah?

51:59.533 --> 52:01.284
- I'm giving you a phone number.
- Okay.

52:01.577 --> 52:06.289
Quickly. Lieutenant Harvel Shansky,
Tucson PD. 8-4-6...

52:23.224 --> 52:26.476
Gary, I need to be able to talk
to a goddamn correspondent on the ground.

52:26.560 --> 52:29.020
- The shooter's in custody.
- Who is he? How'd they get him?

52:41.742 --> 52:42.992
Everybody up! Up, up!

52:43.077 --> 52:45.328
...recording their next album without Maines.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.914
We'll get the inside scoop
from Natalie herself.

53:37.590 --> 53:39.549
We're cutting into our
program with breaking news.

53:39.633 --> 53:43.469
A local Tucson newspaper is reporting
that Arizona Congresswoman Gabby...

53:44.054 --> 53:45.805
Gabrielle Giffords has been shot

53:45.890 --> 53:49.309
while holding a public event
in Tucson outside a grocery store.

53:49.393 --> 53:52.729
Possibly as many as 12 others
have been rushed to an area hospital...

53:52.897 --> 53:56.107
We're now learning that three members
of Gabrielle Giffords' staff

53:56.191 --> 53:59.485
were among those wounded and rushed
to University Medical Center in Tucson.

53:59.612 --> 54:00.737
Does he have an arrest record?

54:00.821 --> 54:03.239
They've had him for over an hour now.
How can they not know who he is?

54:03.324 --> 54:04.991
He's not going on the air with maybe.

54:06.118 --> 54:08.077
- Jim. Jim.
- No, an arrest record.

54:08.162 --> 54:11.039
Can you tell me if the congresswoman's
district office has received any threats?

54:11.123 --> 54:12.081
- Jim.
- Yeah?

54:12.166 --> 54:13.499
NPR is saying she's dead.

54:17.588 --> 54:19.005
- Anyone else?
- No.

54:19.798 --> 54:21.007
Then she's not dead yet.

54:23.677 --> 54:26.763
If you're just joining us,
a gunman in Arizona opened fire...

54:26.847 --> 54:30.350
Fox, MSNBC and CNN are all calling it.

54:30.434 --> 54:31.601
Let me hear MSNBC.

54:31.685 --> 54:33.603
A sole source of information

54:33.687 --> 54:39.359
that reports that the Arizona congresswoman
Gabrielle Giffords has been killed

54:39.944 --> 54:42.362
in this heinous attempt on her life...

54:43.197 --> 54:44.489
Joey.

54:57.336 --> 54:59.545
Get me some official confirmation,
or I'm not calling it now.

55:00.464 --> 55:02.465
Why hasn't he called it yet?

55:02.549 --> 55:05.218
I don't have time right now.

55:05.302 --> 55:06.469
Jim, why hasn't he called it?

55:06.553 --> 55:08.513
- Gary, I need him in the hospital.
- He's there.

55:08.806 --> 55:10.932
CNN, MSNBC and FOX say she's dead.

55:11.016 --> 55:12.433
They're all going off the same NPR report.

55:12.518 --> 55:14.602
- I'm not satisfied.
- I don't give a shit if you're satisfied.

55:14.687 --> 55:16.396
What the hell is he... Hey!

55:16.814 --> 55:19.941
We're going to show you now an interview
Gabrielle Giffords gave just last year.

55:20.025 --> 55:21.818
This is Congresswoman Giffords.

55:21.902 --> 55:23.486
- Thirty seconds.
- What's going on?

55:23.737 --> 55:26.322
- I'll call security.
- Every second you're not current,

55:26.407 --> 55:28.616
1,000 people are changing the channel
to the guy who is.

55:28.701 --> 55:30.535
That's the business you're in.

55:31.745 --> 55:34.831
MSNBC, Fox and CNN all say she's dead.
Don, tell him.

55:36.709 --> 55:37.959
Don!

55:38.419 --> 55:40.503
It's a person.

55:40.587 --> 55:42.755
A doctor pronounces her dead, not the news.

55:57.021 --> 55:59.272
Back in five, four...

56:05.654 --> 56:08.656
What we know so far is that
Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords

56:08.741 --> 56:11.325
and 12 others
were shot when a gunman opened fire

56:11.410 --> 56:13.745
at a local town hall in Tucson, Arizona.

56:20.794 --> 56:23.171
Is he overhearing it or is he at the hospital?

56:23.255 --> 56:24.797
- She's alive!
- Who's telling you that?

56:25.049 --> 56:27.258
The anesthesiologist.
She's being prepped for surgery.

56:27.342 --> 56:29.552
- I've got her alive!
- NPR called it wrong. She's alive.

56:30.345 --> 56:31.763
She's alive.

56:31.972 --> 56:33.056
Will.

56:34.349 --> 56:37.268
All right, we're learning now
that Giffords is being prepped for surgery,

56:37.352 --> 56:39.979
and we have our ACN affiliate
at University Hospital now.

56:40.064 --> 56:41.189
What can you tell us?

56:41.398 --> 56:42.398
Will...

56:42.816 --> 56:44.233
Mac, get in here with Charlie right now.

56:44.943 --> 56:46.152
- Is everything...
- Right now!

56:57.623 --> 57:00.083
You tell Leona that if she wants me
out of this chair,

57:00.167 --> 57:01.834
she better bring more than
just a couple of guys.

57:01.919 --> 57:03.503
That's exactly what I'll fucking tell her.

57:03.754 --> 57:06.422
- I'm not fucking around, Charlie!
- Feet of fucking steel.

57:06.840 --> 57:07.924
- Mac.
- I'm sorry.

57:08.008 --> 57:09.801
- It's not your fault.
- I fucked everything up!

57:09.885 --> 57:11.969
- It's gonna be all right.
- What the fuck is going on?

57:12.054 --> 57:13.679
You're a fucking newsman, Don!

57:13.764 --> 57:16.390
I ever tell you otherwise,
you punch me in the face!

57:18.018 --> 57:20.520
- Okay, but you're back in 30.
- Back in 30 seconds.

57:25.317 --> 57:27.235
Joey. Just breathe regular.

57:43.877 --> 57:46.420
This is a sketchy description of the procedure
they'll be trying.

57:46.505 --> 57:47.630
Hey.

57:48.048 --> 57:50.049
When this is over,
let me see the bigfoot presentation.

57:50.592 --> 57:51.592
Really?

57:52.386 --> 57:55.429
I think I need some consulting
on what's real and what's not.

57:55.514 --> 57:57.974
Okay, I think you'll find that
there's some striking evidence...

57:58.058 --> 57:59.851
- Not now.
- Stand by, camera one.

57:59.935 --> 58:01.561
- Right.
- In three, two...

58:02.521 --> 58:05.189
Thank you, Tom.
Let's put together what we know.

58:05.357 --> 58:07.984
A little after noon today,
Congresswoman Gabby Giffords

58:08.068 --> 58:10.945
was shot while holding a town hall meeting
in Tucson, Arizona.
