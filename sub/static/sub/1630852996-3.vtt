00:03.837 --> 00:05.755
accessible to everyone in this country.

00:05.880 --> 00:08.591
You need to start bringing
in venture capital firms.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.720
Hello, Don. Elizabeth Holmes.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.596
And when Larry Ellison came to you

00:14.014 --> 00:16.891
with his vision for how Oracle
could organize data,

00:17.017 --> 00:19.894
- you said, "How much do you need?"
- I want you to meet Larry Ellison.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.980
If you want this, you gotta fight!

00:22.105 --> 00:24.315
That's what it takes
to run a billion-dollar company.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.776
- Is that what you really want?
- Yes!

00:26.901 --> 00:28.778
What are you willing to do
to get it?

00:29.571 --> 00:32.282
- We faked the demo.
- Don't tell anyone else.

00:32.532 --> 00:37.328
Our series B round
closed at $165 million.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.248
I'm gonna change the world!

01:33.968 --> 01:36.763
What were you doing in India,
"Mr. Balwa--

01:36.846 --> 01:39.849
It's Balwani.
And I've actually got somewhere to be.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.851
- Oh. Where?
- I'm buying an iPhone.

01:42.769 --> 01:43.770
A what?

01:44.395 --> 01:45.438
It's new.

01:45.563 --> 01:47.899
And why do you need another phone,
Mr. Balwani?

01:48.024 --> 01:49.234
What is the phone for?

01:50.902 --> 01:53.154
- Is this funny to you?
- No, sir.

01:54.322 --> 01:55.406
What's your occupation?

01:56.699 --> 01:59.494
I started a company and...
and I sold it, so...

01:59.619 --> 02:01.913
Going to ask you again,
what is your occupation?

02:04.499 --> 02:05.625
I don't have one.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.634
- Yeah!
- Come on in!

02:17.512 --> 02:20.014
I fucking love Steve Jobs!

02:23.768 --> 02:24.894
Whoo-hoo!

02:25.019 --> 02:28.273
I got the first one. Yeah!

02:28.731 --> 02:30.066
Whoo!

02:30.275 --> 02:31.985
Yeah!

02:32.277 --> 02:34.237
Whoo!

02:34.821 --> 02:36.197
Yes!

02:37.740 --> 02:38.908
Yes!

02:39.242 --> 02:40.660
Whoo!

02:49.043 --> 02:51.921
You designed the iPhone.

02:52.505 --> 02:55.425
I'm-- I'm so starstruck right now.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.594
Well, I can't take all the credit.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.762
- And Steve wouldn't let me.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.390
But I did make it prettier to look at.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.727
See that's the thing
Steve really understood.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.145
You can have all the right tech

03:07.228 --> 03:09.105
on the inside,
but without the right look--

03:09.397 --> 03:10.982
- None of it matters.
- Yeah. Exactly.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.609
That's my weakness.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.944
I... I never think about
what things look like.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.780
I can see that.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.033
Oh. No. You don't...

03:21.159 --> 03:22.493
you don't like what I'm wearing?

03:22.702 --> 03:25.079
You should just dress more like a CEO.

03:26.956 --> 03:31.252
I... When I was with Mark Zuckerberg
at the photoshoot for <i>Ink,</i>

03:31.419 --> 03:34.839
he was wearing soccer sandals, flip-flops.

03:35.131 --> 03:39.302
Yes, but you are a woman.
If you wear soccer sandals to work,

03:39.469 --> 03:41.554
everyone would think
that you're having a mental breakdown.

03:41.679 --> 03:44.057
Yeah, I just don't wanna waste my time
picking out what I'm gonna wear.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.059
It's not a waste of time.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.810
For you. You're a designer.

03:48.478 --> 03:52.732
Listen, how you present yourself
to the world is your identity.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.068
It's-- it's your armor.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.195
You're a good person,

03:57.654 --> 03:58.696
I'm rooting for you.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.490
Honestly,

04:01.032 --> 04:04.869
it's just really exciting to me
that you're a young female CEO

04:04.994 --> 04:06.996
instead of a cocky little boy
in a sweatshirt.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.003
Yeah, well...

04:14.379 --> 04:17.465
what do I have to do
to convince you to work here?

04:19.092 --> 04:22.262
Avie Tevanian joined our board,
and he's a big fan of you.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.721
I love Avie.

04:24.389 --> 04:28.476
He said that you'd lose 15,000 shares
of Apple stock if you left.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.480
It's my retirement.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.275
- I got a wife, I got kids.
-Yeah.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.778
But the outsiders have
to stick together.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.155
That's how we change the world.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.371
Seriously though,

04:49.038 --> 04:51.082
your company
has momentum now.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.211
And when the board starts smelling money,
they're gonna get tough on you.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.630
Watch your back.

05:02.051 --> 05:04.304
Why the fuck do you want a car
that doesn't make any noise?

05:04.470 --> 05:06.681
It's a Prius, Sunny.
It's what everybody is driving.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.308
Why do you even need a new car?

05:08.808 --> 05:10.143
I like driving you.

05:25.199 --> 05:26.451
It's not even real leather.

05:27.702 --> 05:28.703
I like it.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.916
You know, I'm looking into
this computer science grad program

05:34.000 --> 05:35.126
at Stanford.

05:35.376 --> 05:38.004
I'm thinking of going back
to school again. What do you think?

05:38.713 --> 05:40.298
Do you think my board respects me?

05:41.883 --> 05:43.551
Sure. Just keep making them money.

05:45.928 --> 05:46.929
Could they fire me?

05:47.764 --> 05:48.806
From my own company?

05:49.891 --> 05:50.975
Of course they can.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.895
You took money from VCs. They own you.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.693
Hey. Do you have any questions?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.156
The demo cars don't lock.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.574
-<i>My name's Bruce.</i>

06:06.657 --> 06:07.867
<i>If you have any questions, let me know.</i>

06:09.160 --> 06:10.870
Ugh! I have to get this.
It's Larry Ellison.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.503
Hey, Sunny,

06:19.087 --> 06:21.089
we should go out,

06:21.672 --> 06:23.216
like, on a date or something.

06:24.550 --> 06:25.551
Okay.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.223
Is she taking a call in there?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.225
It's private.

06:34.685 --> 06:37.188
<i>I know you're not</i>
<i>much of a reader, but Elizabeth</i>

06:37.271 --> 06:41.734
was just profiled in <i>Ink </i>magazine's
30 under 30 with Mark Zuckerberg...

06:42.402 --> 06:43.444
who made Facebook.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.406
Is that the thing
where single people put their pictures up?

06:46.531 --> 06:48.032
My stepson is on that.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.201
Hey, not a big deal,

06:50.284 --> 06:53.371
but has Elizabeth received any emails
from Richard lately?

06:53.454 --> 06:56.582
No. Why would Richard
be emailing Elizabeth?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.418
Well,

06:58.543 --> 07:01.671
this is kinda silly actually,
but I think he was hurt

07:01.796 --> 07:03.881
that she didn't contact him
for advice on her company,

07:03.965 --> 07:06.884
you know, since his company
also invents biomedical devices and...

07:07.135 --> 07:08.678
- It made him a little angry.
- What?

07:09.303 --> 07:12.473
He was mad
she didn't call him for advice?

07:12.598 --> 07:14.767
Well... yeah.

07:15.184 --> 07:16.811
He's been researching
what she's doing.

07:16.936 --> 07:19.147
I think he might be trying to have
a little fun with her company.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.815
"A little fun with her company." What?

07:21.065 --> 07:23.401
He applied for a patent.
I don't really understand it,

07:23.484 --> 07:26.654
but I think he wants her to buy him off,
you know, just for fun.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.158
So, your husband
has been secretly researching

07:30.241 --> 07:33.369
my daughter's company
so he can make money off her?

07:33.494 --> 07:35.538
My 23-year-old daughter?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.207
Well, you don't have
to make it sound so bad.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.252
Mrs. Holmes.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.881
Wait. Mrs. Holmes!

07:46.382 --> 07:47.717
Mrs. Holmes!

07:49.051 --> 07:50.052
Richard!

07:51.137 --> 07:52.722
- Richard!
-Yes?

07:53.598 --> 07:54.599
Richard!

07:57.059 --> 07:59.979
Hello, Noel.
You look like you need a glass of water.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.481
What did you do to Elizabeth?

08:01.606 --> 08:03.733
Richard. Richard!

08:04.692 --> 08:05.693
Oh, God.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.528
You're trying to mess
with Elizabeth's company?

08:08.196 --> 08:10.281
Richard. Everybody, be nice.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.533
There's nothing for you
to worry about,

08:12.700 --> 08:13.868
- Noel.
- He's just having fun.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.371
I'm a businessman.
I think she's got a great idea.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.831
I wanna be a part of it.

08:19.248 --> 08:23.586
So, I looked into what she's going
to need, and I invented a mechanism

08:24.128 --> 08:26.172
that will alert doctors
when their patients

08:26.297 --> 08:29.217
have an abnormal blood test.
If she ever wants to put

08:29.300 --> 08:31.219
a blood-testing device
in someone's home,

08:31.302 --> 08:34.472
- she'll have to license my invention.
- Buy you off.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.267
Your words, not mine.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.853
- You're sick.
- If she'd called and asked my advice,

08:41.020 --> 08:43.231
I would've told her.
Things like this can happen.

08:43.481 --> 08:46.317
- You know what? Can I get anyone coffee?
- You're a tiny man.

08:49.487 --> 08:53.991
Oh, stop being such a nice little WASP
and tell me to fuck off, Noel.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.077
Fuck off!

08:56.744 --> 08:57.912
No, you fuck off.

08:57.995 --> 09:01.582
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

09:10.341 --> 09:12.343
- You said that to him?

09:12.426 --> 09:15.680
- Your mom used the F word.
- I said it a couple of times.

09:18.015 --> 09:19.058
Thank you. I...

09:19.392 --> 09:22.311
I haven't heard about
any patent applications.

09:22.478 --> 09:25.398
- He's... he's bluffing.
- I'm never speaking to Lorraine again.

09:25.523 --> 09:28.150
- They both can fuck off!
- Oh, my gosh.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.447
-<i>Mm! Shit!</i>
- What?

09:34.490 --> 09:36.534
I spilled my coffee. Oh, shit.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.744
Doesn't the Prius have a cup holder?

10:09.358 --> 10:11.277
Hey, Bridget Jones.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.822
I thought we were meeting with the board.

10:15.239 --> 10:17.199
Girl, that cannot be
what you are wearing.

10:17.533 --> 10:21.037
-Oh, I... I spilled my coffee.
-Oh, God.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.166
I've been meaning to ask you,
I still haven't received dimensions

10:25.333 --> 10:26.334
for the prototype.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.752
Oh...

10:28.753 --> 10:29.754
Yeah.

10:30.379 --> 10:33.299
-Elizabeth. We're up here.
- Hi, Don.

10:33.549 --> 10:37.011
Hey. Sweetheart, you're so skinny.
You should eat something.

10:46.395 --> 10:50.483
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. Come on...

10:51.942 --> 10:52.902
Fuck.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.363
Ceiling between the channels...

10:55.446 --> 10:57.406
Sucks. Yeah.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.534
Uncontrolled mixing is gonna kill
result accuracy.

11:00.868 --> 11:01.869
So, you agree?

11:02.203 --> 11:03.913
Well, it's not ready for the Pfizer trial.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.456
No.

11:07.708 --> 11:08.709
I'll tell her.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.712
I mean, she'll get it.
It's-- it's-- it's people.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.214
We can't test this on people.

11:14.423 --> 11:15.424
No.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.134
They're all waiting for you.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.844
-Wow.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.348
Oh, wow.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.477
Hi. Hi, guys.

11:27.645 --> 11:28.729
Thanks for coming.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.232
Wow.

11:39.490 --> 11:42.618
It's great that, uh,
we've got the board here.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.706
The... This new location, new space.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.999
Speak up! We can't hear you.

11:53.963 --> 11:56.090
- So, we have some...

11:59.802 --> 12:01.929
- We have...

12:02.513 --> 12:04.223
We have some exciting
new developments.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.646
Including Ana Arriola, who has been
with us for a few months.

12:10.813 --> 12:13.858
And Ana and Avie Tevanian
know each other from Apple.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.361
That's right. We stole her from Apple.

12:21.157 --> 12:22.950
Has there been any progress
on the prototype?

12:23.492 --> 12:26.370
'Cause I know an engineer
who can come in and really ramp things up.

12:26.495 --> 12:30.416
- His name is Brendan Morris.
- Thank you, but we are full steam ahead.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.589
What do you think
they're talking about?

12:38.257 --> 12:42.553
He's worried about the Novartis contract.
Avie says it hasn't come through.

12:42.803 --> 12:46.182
Well, tell him that... that we have
plenty of pharmaceutical interest.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.434
Well, I haven't seen any of the contracts.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.357
I mean, nobody's talking about it
except Avie, but he'll bring it up.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.986
I don't know how long he'll listen to me,
but what do you want me to do?

12:59.069 --> 13:00.321
I need friends on the board.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.114
Well, of course, I'm there for you.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.785
You know, I... I've been thinking, um...

13:06.869 --> 13:08.579
when we get into this new office space,

13:09.455 --> 13:12.416
we should... you should come on as--
as a consultant.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.544
- I'm already a consultant.
- Right. But it will be more formal, like,

13:15.669 --> 13:17.963
you would have your own office and salary.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.052
Oh, that... that sounds perfect.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.971
-Elizabeth.
- Hi.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.723
Hi, Avie.

13:28.057 --> 13:31.769
I was... I was wondering,
is... is there any new about Novartis?

13:34.188 --> 13:37.566
Uh, unfortunately, we just got word
that it's not going to work out.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.318
Oh...

13:40.402 --> 13:42.613
Really? What happened?
I thought you said the contracts

13:42.738 --> 13:46.033
- were in the final stages.
- It's complicated.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.871
But I'd like to... I'd like to really
focus right now on the new space.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.874
Yeah. I'm just...
The projection's building

13:53.958 --> 13:57.378
the revenue from the Novartis deal.
Should... should we even be looking

13:57.461 --> 13:59.213
at this space if we don't
have that revenue anymore?

13:59.922 --> 14:02.550
Well, we're finalizing contracts
with Pfizer.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.803
- You are?
- Yep.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.557
I read the information you sent out,
and you haven't had

14:09.682 --> 14:12.726
a successful validation study
with actual patients yet.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.687
Well, that's a formality.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.939
Validating if the machine works
is a formality?

14:17.606 --> 14:18.607
Elizabeth.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.987
Look, I'm here to help you.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.490
That's why you have a board. To help.

14:27.908 --> 14:31.161
My father was an entrepreneur,
I understand there are ups and downs.

14:31.328 --> 14:34.248
Yeah, I've... Well, we have plenty of...
pharmaceutical interest,

14:34.331 --> 14:36.208
- including Pfizer, so...
- Yeah, but are you going through

14:36.292 --> 14:38.586
with the Pfizer trial?
Because Ana told me...

14:38.669 --> 14:39.670
You talked to Ana?

14:40.129 --> 14:41.630
Well, she said she hasn't seen
the device yet.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.007
She hasn't even gotten dimensions
for it.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.508
If you wanna know, you just...
You can ask me.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.928
- I am asking you. That is what I'm doing.
- We are going through with the trial.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.307
You're going forward
with the Pfizer trial?

14:51.473 --> 14:52.683
Yes, we are. We are ready.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.812
Ah, you know, if you...
if you'll excuse me,

14:56.896 --> 14:58.439
I have to... I have to go talk to Don.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.441
Wait, wait. Your...

15:03.777 --> 15:04.778
Your...

15:10.451 --> 15:12.578
We need to find out which employees
are talking to each other.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.249
How should I...
How do you want me to do that?

15:17.541 --> 15:20.127
Uh, I don't know. Friend them
on Facebook, and then find out

15:20.252 --> 15:21.295
who's friends with each other.

15:21.545 --> 15:24.506
Friend every employee in the company
on Facebook to spy on them?

15:24.590 --> 15:26.091
That's what I said, okay?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.177
Also...

15:30.137 --> 15:32.139
I searched for Richard Fuisz.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.016
The IT guys found this.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.979
They said it was randomly sent
to info@theranos.com, the general email.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.691
So, apparently, he just patented an alert
for a home blood testing device

15:42.775 --> 15:44.360
and they think you might have
to buy him out.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.111
I need to get legal on the phone.

15:46.362 --> 15:47.696
I need to hire a security team,

15:47.821 --> 15:49.114
and no one knows about this, okay?

15:56.288 --> 15:58.165
Oh, should I come back or...

15:59.583 --> 16:01.085
Do you want a... a shirt?

16:01.251 --> 16:02.336
It's okay.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.259
Fuck.

16:17.601 --> 16:18.727
Yes.

16:20.270 --> 16:21.522
Yes, but would you be willing...

16:22.940 --> 16:24.066
Hi, sorry.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.570
- I ordered for you.
- No, that's not what I'm saying at all.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.072
Soba noodles

16:30.155 --> 16:33.158
with miso-infused,
locally grown pumpkin.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.202
Like what?

16:36.203 --> 16:38.163
- A pumpkin patch?
- Yes, that should not be a problem.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.249
I look forward to talking after Nashville.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.253
Yeah. Okay. Bye. Yeah. Bye.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.423
Pfizer?

16:47.506 --> 16:50.134
Yeah, I'm...
I'm going ahead with the validation study.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.513
With cancer patients?
You're ready to test it on people?

16:55.889 --> 16:58.183
It's just a trial.
That's... Everybody does trials.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.270
What?

17:03.939 --> 17:05.190
You're 40 minutes late.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.153
I just found out that Richard Fuisz,
my neighbor growing up,

17:09.903 --> 17:12.364
is trying to get me to buy
a patent off of him.

17:12.489 --> 17:15.951
Avie Tevanian was asking
about our cash flow at the site,

17:16.035 --> 17:19.371
so I had to show him that we're moving
on the pharmaceutical contracts.

17:20.080 --> 17:23.000
So, I had to say yes to Pfizer,
and... I don't... I don't want this.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.251
It's okay. You can leave it.

17:27.963 --> 17:29.631
Can you get off your phone?
We're eating.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.134
I can't... I can't do this.
I have to get back to the office.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.927
- Then I'll come with you. I'll help.
- No.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.015
- "No"? Just "no"?
- I don't want them to think

17:38.140 --> 17:39.433
that I need my boyfriend's help.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.185
No one knows I'm your boyfriend.

17:42.227 --> 17:43.729
No one knows who I am.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.481
I can't do one thing wrong.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.443
I can't give them one reason
to doubt me.

17:49.943 --> 17:53.113
Or I will lose my company.
They will take it away, okay?

17:53.280 --> 17:54.490
All right, I'll see you at home.

18:12.216 --> 18:13.217
Excuse me.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.094
Excuse me!

18:17.096 --> 18:18.722
This has truffle oil in it.

18:18.847 --> 18:20.849
Uh, there's no truffle oil in this...

18:20.974 --> 18:23.602
You think I don't know
what truffle oil smells like, don't you?

18:24.269 --> 18:26.730
- No, I...
- That table over there has truffle oil.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.857
And that table, and that table.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.611
I can smell fucking truffle oil
from a mile away.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.075
I'll take this back to the kitchen.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.178
Hey, what do you run on that computer,
Mac or Windows?

18:58.679 --> 18:59.847
"I'm a Mac."

19:01.765 --> 19:04.393
"I'm a Mac." "I am a PC."
Never mind.

19:04.893 --> 19:06.645
Why do you wanna know?
You putting in spyware?

19:20.993 --> 19:24.079
Sir, you can't go in there.
If you don't work in engineering,

19:24.204 --> 19:25.289
you don't go in the lab.

19:25.539 --> 19:28.500
But, E-- Edmond Ku is in Nashville
and he asked me to check on things.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.627
Employees are siloed
to their own departments.

19:32.921 --> 19:36.175
Well, would I be allowed
to knock in Morse code?

19:37.134 --> 19:38.218
I can check.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.355
<i>NEWS ANCHOR:</i>

20:04.077 --> 20:06.997
Hello. I'm Elizabeth Holmes from Theranos.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.500
We're doing a study for Pfizer.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.466
Is the doctor here?

20:19.051 --> 20:22.804
Hey, listen up! Important question.
Did anyone else get a friend request

20:22.930 --> 20:24.181
from Elizabeth's assistant?

20:25.933 --> 20:27.476
Damn, I thought it was just me.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.938
Uh, Rakesh, you're a celebrated engineer,
tell me,

20:31.104 --> 20:33.607
do you think this book's heavy enough
to keep the door open?

20:33.815 --> 20:35.651
It's 100 percent not heavy enough.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.945
Ha! That's where you're wrong, because...

20:38.278 --> 20:39.363
Oh...

20:40.614 --> 20:41.865
Sorry. Sorry.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.041
Can I help you at all?

20:51.708 --> 20:53.043
I'm just taking a look around.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.305
My name is Ian Gibbons.
Do... do I know you?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.724
Your face is familiar somehow.

21:09.142 --> 21:12.813
Sunny Balwani.
I'm an unofficial consultant.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.277
I have some questions.

21:19.778 --> 21:20.946
It's all there.

21:21.488 --> 21:23.282
I mean, there is nothing there.

21:23.824 --> 21:27.703
Look, I really... I like Elizabeth,
I do, but don't you think it's strange

21:27.828 --> 21:30.539
that we haven't seen a single contract,
absolutely nothing

21:30.664 --> 21:32.374
to back up any of these projections?

21:34.626 --> 21:35.627
I'm not saying it's her fault.

21:35.711 --> 21:40.924
She's a kid. She's not ready to be CEO.
She needs adult supervision.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.135
I tried to email you, but...

21:44.469 --> 21:45.387
Why don't you have email?

21:45.554 --> 21:47.139
Because I've been sued too many times.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.017
Look, this may not be the way
they do it at Apple.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.269
I do things by my gut.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.813
- I trust her.
- Don.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.525
You are too close to this.
You have brunch with her every weekend.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.569
You are practically acting
like her father.

22:00.861 --> 22:04.031
Avie, as far as I'm concerned,
you should tender your resignation.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.784
- What?
- I'm asking you to resign.

22:09.786 --> 22:11.788
- You're firing me from the board?
- I'm asking you...

22:11.955 --> 22:13.040
Is that what your gut's
says you should do?

22:13.123 --> 22:14.124
...to resign tonight!

22:17.753 --> 22:18.754
Tonight.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.924
Fine. Just...

22:23.467 --> 22:26.970
start asking questions.
She is lying to you.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.909
Helena had stage-four breast cancer
by the time we caught it.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.079
- Too late for most treatment options.
- I'm toast.

23:04.633 --> 23:05.634
Wrong side.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.886
Right. Right. S... Sorry.

23:09.930 --> 23:14.851
So... It's actually-- It's very simple.
You're gonna have a finger puncture.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.020
All we need is a drop of blood.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.856
Been stuck so many times,
I got no veins left.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.025
Y'all are doing a good thing here.

23:27.406 --> 23:31.660
Hold on. It's... Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I just forgot something.

23:31.785 --> 23:32.786
Just one second.

23:45.507 --> 23:46.508
What are you doing?

23:47.467 --> 23:48.510
Get back in there, Edmond.

23:48.677 --> 23:51.430
Elizabeth, it doesn't work yet.
It's not even close to working yet.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.142
- It's not supposed to work. It's a trial.
- It...This...This isn't what I do.

23:55.225 --> 23:58.019
I... I work with machines.
I work with tech. I don't...

24:01.064 --> 24:02.899
How can we ask these people to...

24:07.529 --> 24:10.157
These people know
that they're participating in a trial.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.825
This is how these things are done, Edmond.

24:12.075 --> 24:13.160
This isn't you...

24:18.665 --> 24:19.708
Elizabeth.

24:27.632 --> 24:28.717
Go back in there.

24:51.156 --> 24:54.784
Uh, so, when you take this home with you,
just remember that...

24:55.994 --> 24:59.873
it's very, very delicate,
and so it can't be near a window,

24:59.956 --> 25:04.878
or an AC unit, or heater.
And... And it... and it can't get wet.

25:08.381 --> 25:09.382
Thank you.

25:24.564 --> 25:27.108
<i>You're back.</i>
<i>How was Nashville?</i>

25:27.609 --> 25:29.653
Good. Just unpacking.

25:42.457 --> 25:46.044
The patients know
that they're participating in a trial.

25:48.004 --> 25:49.381
Go back in there, Edmond.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.968
Go back in there, Edmond.

25:56.012 --> 25:58.390
Go back in there...
Go back in there, Edmond.

26:00.016 --> 26:01.935
This is an inspiring step forward.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.480
An inspiring step forward.

26:06.773 --> 26:09.276
An inspiring step forward.

26:21.955 --> 26:22.956
Don.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.125
Avie is out.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.466
Good. He didn't understand the vision.

26:36.011 --> 26:38.305
You've told me everything
I need to know, right?

26:38.972 --> 26:39.973
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:40.140 --> 26:41.725
<i>I just got back from Nashville.</i>

26:42.100 --> 26:43.101
Don,

26:43.602 --> 26:46.271
- this is an inspiring step forward.
- Do you have a cold?

26:47.188 --> 26:48.189
N...

26:48.815 --> 26:50.317
No, I'm fine. I...

26:51.359 --> 26:52.360
Everything's fine.

27:02.037 --> 27:04.039
So, how was Nashville?

27:05.040 --> 27:08.084
I can't talk about it.
It's... you know, NDA.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.671
What? Oh, this is terrible.

27:12.339 --> 27:15.884
Suddenly, everyone's on
a need-to-know basis, well I need to know.

27:16.092 --> 27:18.970
I mean, my whole job is needing to know.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.435
Uh...

27:27.896 --> 27:28.897
Who's that?

27:29.773 --> 27:33.610
That is Brendan Morris.
She brought in a new engineer.

27:34.027 --> 27:36.071
We're not moving fast enough apparently.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.906
We don't know what's he's working on.

27:38.031 --> 27:40.367
He just goes into the office
and shuts the door.

27:40.867 --> 27:41.868
Hmm.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.038
Hang on. I've got an idea.

27:54.714 --> 27:55.632
Yeah.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.967
Good day, sir. I have the package
you ordered,

27:58.134 --> 28:00.804
and I think it's best that I come in
to your office and set it down.

28:01.721 --> 28:03.390
That box is already open,

28:03.556 --> 28:05.433
and it's got an empty Snapple bottle
inside of it.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.105
Well, you ordered it.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.400
So, yeah, if you're
the one who ordered it, then I...

28:14.484 --> 28:18.071
- Damn.
- I have an idea.

28:21.991 --> 28:23.076
<i>God damn it.</i>

28:25.787 --> 28:27.497
Yeah.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.375
Hello, could you tell us
what you're working on?

28:34.212 --> 28:36.381
Obviously, we're going
in a different direction.

28:36.631 --> 28:38.925
You've repurposed
a glue-dispensing robot?

28:39.259 --> 28:41.553
Yeah. Check it out.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.736
She's not gonna tell you
what's she's gonna do.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.195
She never tells you what's she's doing.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.406
The point is, you hired another engineer

29:01.614 --> 29:03.283
to create a completely
different prototype.

29:03.491 --> 29:07.620
I-- If I may, you see,
his machine is not microfluidics.

29:07.954 --> 29:10.874
- It... He's just reprogrammed a...
- It's a fucking glue bot.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.334
If you don't like it,
then get your version to work better.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.837
Are you trying to pit us
against each other? What are you doing?

29:16.087 --> 29:18.298
What, you... you want us
to compete against an automated arm?

29:18.465 --> 29:19.758
I want something to actually work.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.847
Is this because of what happened
in Nashville?

29:30.059 --> 29:32.771
Nashville was an inspiring step forward.

29:34.814 --> 29:35.815
Are we done?

29:43.114 --> 29:44.115
What?

29:44.365 --> 29:46.910
Is this what you want,
what Brendan's doing?

29:47.410 --> 29:50.246
He's just miniaturizing a process
that already exists.

29:51.080 --> 29:56.044
It's big and ugly and it's not new.
And... and it's not your vision.

29:58.129 --> 30:00.298
I'm worried that perhaps
this is all my fault.

30:01.466 --> 30:04.469
Perhaps I answered
the consultant's questions

30:04.677 --> 30:05.762
- in the wrong way.
- Consultant?

30:07.138 --> 30:09.140
Yes, a man called Sunny,

30:09.349 --> 30:10.934
he came while you were in Nashville

30:11.100 --> 30:12.977
- and asked us questions.
- What are you talking about?

30:13.102 --> 30:14.979
- Well, he said that...
- I... when I was in Nashville?

30:15.188 --> 30:16.147
No.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.693
You did not answer
his questions wrong.

30:23.196 --> 30:25.698
I... I can't talk about this right now,
Ian.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.869
Okay. Uh, right.

30:33.873 --> 30:37.919
You can't just show up at my office.
You told them that you were a consultant?

30:38.586 --> 30:40.213
Do you want to talk about that,

30:41.256 --> 30:44.342
or the fact you're ten years away
from the promises you made to the board?

30:54.060 --> 30:55.103
How do you know that?

30:55.895 --> 30:57.313
What's your plan?

30:58.773 --> 31:00.733
Just keep everything
from the board forever?

31:05.321 --> 31:06.406
What is that?

31:07.448 --> 31:10.034
It's green juice. I bought it for you.

31:10.535 --> 31:11.536
It's healthy.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.831
If you're going to work 20 hours a day,
you need to eat healthier.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.332
So, what are saying, you think I look bad?

31:16.457 --> 31:17.500
You look like shit.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.097
Do you know why I went to your office?

31:32.891 --> 31:34.767
Because I don't like the way you treat me.

31:35.643 --> 31:36.728
How do I treat you?

31:36.811 --> 31:39.814
You dismiss me. You act like
I'm some guy hanging around.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.526
I founded a company, I ran it, I sold it.

31:43.693 --> 31:46.237
Yeah, and that really impressed me
when I was 18.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.037
You know what I saw
when I went to your office?

31:54.120 --> 31:55.121
What?

31:56.331 --> 31:58.708
No one respects you.
No one listens to you.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.544
They talk behind your back,
they make fun of you.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.088
They're laughing at you, Elizabeth.

32:05.340 --> 32:07.926
You're in over your head.
You're going to lose everything.

32:08.509 --> 32:11.304
But go ahead, keep ignoring me,
keep dismissing me.

32:15.558 --> 32:18.144
This juice is disgusting. I hate it.

32:20.855 --> 32:22.231
- Disgusting.
- Drink it.

32:23.608 --> 32:24.609
No.

32:26.486 --> 32:27.487
Drink it.

32:28.154 --> 32:29.155
No.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.865
It cost 12 dollars. Drink it,
it's good for you.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.326
- I don't care how much it cost.
- Elizabeth.

32:33.409 --> 32:35.078
Go fuck yourself, Sunny.
I don't give a fuck.

32:35.161 --> 32:38.206
Don't throw it out! Don't throw it out!

33:06.067 --> 33:07.068
Are you coming to bed?

33:54.574 --> 33:55.992
Here at Theranos...

34:01.039 --> 34:02.248
...we are developing...

34:04.751 --> 34:06.169
new technology.

34:07.837 --> 34:10.131
This is an inspiring step forward.

34:11.924 --> 34:14.677
This is an inspiring step forward.

34:16.763 --> 34:19.182
Here at Theranos...

34:20.433 --> 34:23.853
we are developing
new technology.

34:23.936 --> 34:24.937
.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.982
Here at Theranos,

34:28.816 --> 34:30.943
we are developing new technology.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.779
New technology.

34:32.862 --> 34:39.035
This is an inspiring step forward.

34:39.619 --> 34:40.620
Forward.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.497
Forward.

34:42.580 --> 34:43.581
Forward.

34:43.664 --> 34:48.419
This is an inspiring step forward.

35:05.728 --> 35:07.313
I shouldn't have had you meet me here.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.524
I just thought this would be better
face to face.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.401
Drive around the block.

35:43.891 --> 35:45.893
All right. Very nice.

35:47.061 --> 35:49.647
It's, uh-- it's not there yet
but we're getting closer.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.233
- I think it needs a name.
- How about Glue Bot?

35:53.860 --> 35:55.069
Edison.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.447
I'm calling it the Edison.

36:00.074 --> 36:02.076
And this is the direction
that we're going in.

36:27.059 --> 36:29.520
- No, sir. I can't let you take that thing.
- No. Wait. No, that's my Exacto knife.

36:29.645 --> 36:31.272
It is not the intellectual property
of Theranos.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.065
- Just doing my job, sir.
- Come on. It's his Exacto knife.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.275
Sir, please take a step back.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.235
It is my Exacto knife
and I like the way it cuts things.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.404
Please, sir. I'm gonna need you
to take a step back, all right?

36:38.487 --> 36:39.989
Okay. Just take it, but...

36:49.165 --> 36:51.167
Uh, I...

36:52.835 --> 36:55.796
I don't have my car today.
So, if, um...

36:56.172 --> 36:58.424
uh, someone can, uh, give me

36:58.549 --> 37:00.092
the number of a cab company...

37:03.471 --> 37:04.639
All right, let's go.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.114
Elizabeth?

38:06.784 --> 38:08.244
I'm sorry,
I thought she was here.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.251
I here.

38:16.335 --> 38:17.336
I'm here.

38:18.504 --> 38:20.506
- Oh, hey.
- What's going on?

38:20.715 --> 38:22.174
The legal team is ready to see you.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.262
Elizabeth, I need to talk to you.

38:28.431 --> 38:30.891
I'm so sorry.
I was on a very long phone call.

38:32.143 --> 38:35.062
Hi. What... What's going on
with the filing of the lawsuit?

38:35.146 --> 38:37.356
Did you do trials
on terminal cancer patients

38:37.481 --> 38:39.400
with a prototype that didn't work?

38:40.693 --> 38:42.611
Uh, can we have the room, please?

38:43.654 --> 38:44.655
Answer me.

38:44.905 --> 38:47.575
- Where did you hear that? Avie?
- Is it a secret?

38:47.825 --> 38:50.202
No. Uh... no, I just, uh...

38:50.411 --> 38:52.997
That goes against everything
I believe in.

38:53.122 --> 38:54.999
- Ana, it was a trial.
- And I have moral obligation

38:55.124 --> 38:57.376
- to talk to you about the ethics...
- Everybody does trials.

38:59.712 --> 39:04.425
You know, I was trying to remember
what it was I saw in you, why I came here,

39:05.343 --> 39:09.180
and... I don't know, I think
I thought you were like me somehow.

39:09.889 --> 39:10.890
An outsider.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.769
I am. That's why I have to fight
to keep my job.

39:14.935 --> 39:17.521
No. That's why you have to care more.

39:17.813 --> 39:20.566
I only came here because I thought
we were helping people.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.777
I can't help anybody
if I don't have a company.

39:22.985 --> 39:25.029
- That's not the point.
- Yes, it is.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.240
I don't know
what you want from me.

39:28.366 --> 39:32.828
I... You told me to be more of a CEO,
and so I'm trying to do that.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.830
I'm trying. I'm trying.

39:34.997 --> 39:37.041
So sorry, but Elizabeth,
I really need you.

39:39.418 --> 39:43.089
We can discuss this later.
Okay? Ana, please.

39:48.302 --> 39:50.221
No. I'm quitting.

39:51.889 --> 39:53.516
My whole team is quitting.

40:06.153 --> 40:08.656
Make sure Ana doesn't leave
the building with any property.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.658
- I will.
- Oh, and she needs to sign an NDA.

40:10.866 --> 40:12.910
- The design team quit.
- Yeah.

40:13.536 --> 40:15.996
And one of them told me to give you
these books on management.

40:19.667 --> 40:20.918
I think it's a joke.

40:23.504 --> 40:26.757
Why is Don Lucas in my office?

40:27.800 --> 40:31.178
I don't know. That's why I came
and got you. He just showed up.

40:39.687 --> 40:41.105
Hey, Don. I didn't know
that you were coming in.

40:41.230 --> 40:42.231
Shut the door.

40:47.403 --> 40:50.156
How... how are you doing?

40:55.661 --> 40:58.497
Not one of these contracts
is even close to being done.

41:00.207 --> 41:01.208
I know.

41:02.084 --> 41:05.171
I just... I didn't want
to alert the board of...

41:05.379 --> 41:07.256
- to the mechanics...
- Stop the game!

41:08.257 --> 41:11.427
I just spent an hour with your accountant
going over all of this.

41:15.431 --> 41:16.640
You lied to me.

41:19.768 --> 41:21.020
You lied to me.

41:25.232 --> 41:29.862
I know things have not been going
as smoothly as they should have...

41:30.362 --> 41:31.363
and that's my fault.

41:32.198 --> 41:35.784
But I brought on Brendan Morris
who is developing the...

41:35.951 --> 41:38.746
- a version of our prototype.
- I'm going to call for a vote

41:38.871 --> 41:40.206
of no confidence from the board.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.877
You'll no longer be CEO of Theranos.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.507
You had a good idea.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.801
You're just not ready yet.

42:33.092 --> 42:34.093
Tess...

42:35.844 --> 42:37.388
Could you, um...

42:38.264 --> 42:39.265
make me an appointment

42:39.723 --> 42:41.225
at the Genius Bar, please?

43:03.455 --> 43:04.999
What was the name for the account?

43:07.960 --> 43:09.545
Elizabeth Holmes.

43:21.473 --> 43:23.225
Good news. You're insured,
so we can just go ahead

43:23.309 --> 43:24.351
and replace the entire phone today.

43:26.645 --> 43:27.980
Do you wanna give me your phone?

43:28.314 --> 43:30.065
Are you gonna be able to see what's on it?

43:30.733 --> 43:32.359
Just for a few seconds.
I'm gonna go ahead

43:32.443 --> 43:34.194
and back it up to our drive.
Should only take a few minutes.

43:35.321 --> 43:37.031
Your secrets are safe with me.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.539
So, how are you?

43:45.748 --> 43:47.583
I know it can be hard
being without your phone.

43:48.459 --> 43:51.128
You from around here?
Do you go to, like, school nearby?

43:53.547 --> 43:54.798
Stanford.

43:55.215 --> 43:56.467
Oh, awesome!

43:57.217 --> 43:58.844
I'm kind of in-between schools
at the moment,

43:58.927 --> 44:01.680
so I thought I'd work as a genius
until I can figure out what I wanna do.

44:04.224 --> 44:05.434
What was your dream as a child?

44:08.646 --> 44:09.730
As a child?

44:11.023 --> 44:13.567
No, I don't think
I had any dreams as a child.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.195
That sounds nice.

44:17.196 --> 44:18.197
What does?

44:20.074 --> 44:23.369
Not knowing what you wanna do
with your life.

44:24.745 --> 44:27.331
It's not nice, it's scary.

44:27.831 --> 44:31.919
Why are you scared? You can do anything.
Anything that you want.

44:32.127 --> 44:33.087
Thank you.

44:33.253 --> 44:37.383
Because it... it doesn't really matter.
Right? Nothing you do will matter

44:37.508 --> 44:40.260
because you don't really care.

44:41.720 --> 44:43.097
I mean, you...

44:43.430 --> 44:47.184
you have no ambition.
You don't wanna do anything important.

44:48.227 --> 44:49.436
You're just a person.

44:54.024 --> 44:55.109
Uh...

44:55.734 --> 44:57.277
Now, it should, um...

45:01.281 --> 45:04.451
Oh, no. No, no.

45:07.621 --> 45:11.083
I don't know what happened,
but, um, all of your information is...

45:12.251 --> 45:14.461
I mean, it's just... it's gone.

45:15.421 --> 45:17.673
I'm so sorry, I...

45:19.383 --> 45:21.051
I did everything right.

45:21.135 --> 45:27.266
I mean, I followed all of the steps.
I was just too quick to... I'm so sorry.

45:47.786 --> 45:48.996
Elizabeth, we're ready for you.

46:04.219 --> 46:05.220
Ah, Elizabeth.

46:08.098 --> 46:11.018
You are here
because we, collectively,

46:12.144 --> 46:14.438
have lost confidence in your ability

46:15.606 --> 46:17.900
to continue on as CEO of this company.

46:18.358 --> 46:20.694
You have misrepresented
the revenue stream.

46:20.778 --> 46:24.156
You have been unable
to manage research and development.

46:24.615 --> 46:27.534
You have continuously, time after time,
missed deadlines,

46:27.659 --> 46:29.536
resulting in the withdrawal
of our contracts

46:29.661 --> 46:33.874
from pharmaceutical companies,
including, we just found out, Pfizer.

46:34.958 --> 46:37.628
Pfizer has stated it can no longer
go forward based upon

46:37.878 --> 46:40.923
the results of its validation study
in Nashville.

46:42.591 --> 46:45.844
Your design team has resigned.
And, last but not least,

46:46.053 --> 46:48.013
this... this man,

46:48.138 --> 46:52.351
Richard Fuisz,
has filed a competing patent.

46:54.228 --> 46:55.270
This is a mess.

46:56.271 --> 46:58.690
I mean, you have to understand
where we're coming from here.

47:00.150 --> 47:02.027
You need adult supervision.

47:05.030 --> 47:07.699
We've decided that Tom here

47:08.242 --> 47:10.953
should step in as acting CEO

47:11.036 --> 47:12.955
until we can find somebody else.

47:14.373 --> 47:15.999
Of course, yeah. I...

47:17.209 --> 47:18.293
I understand.

47:24.800 --> 47:25.926
I just...

47:27.928 --> 47:29.096
I did everything right.

47:30.389 --> 47:33.392
I... I followed all the steps.

47:39.064 --> 47:40.190
I did it too quick.

47:42.109 --> 47:43.277
And I'm sorry.

47:44.444 --> 47:45.612
I got ahead of myself,

47:46.363 --> 47:51.493
and all your concerns are valid.
You're right. I am in over my head.

47:54.204 --> 47:55.414
I'm just a girl

47:56.582 --> 47:59.418
who had a dream
to change the world,

48:00.210 --> 48:04.339
and I just didn't realize
how hard it was gonna be.

48:05.299 --> 48:10.512
I need help. You're absolutely right.
I need adult supervision.

48:17.227 --> 48:18.270
And that's...

48:19.479 --> 48:22.524
that's why I reached out
to an old friend

48:24.026 --> 48:27.946
to come on board and help me.

48:30.282 --> 48:33.619
He offered to bring in 20 million dollars

48:34.703 --> 48:36.580
and come on as COO,

48:37.205 --> 48:41.126
but only if I'm still the CEO, obviously.

48:42.461 --> 48:43.670
But that's up to you.

48:44.922 --> 48:45.923
Don,

48:47.174 --> 48:48.175
can you forgive me?

48:52.179 --> 48:53.180
Um...

48:54.723 --> 48:57.893
He had an idea that I'd love
to get your advice on.

48:59.561 --> 49:04.024
He thinks that we should
forget pharmaceutical companies

49:04.232 --> 49:07.694
and try to target retail.
Create our own retail space,

49:07.819 --> 49:09.363
like an Apple store.

49:12.407 --> 49:15.077
I don't know. What do you think?

49:23.877 --> 49:25.587
- I'm in here.

49:50.612 --> 49:52.114
It's not working between us.

49:54.282 --> 49:55.492
I know that.

49:59.413 --> 50:02.165
You can stay here for a while
until you find your own place.

50:03.375 --> 50:04.668
- I'll move out.
- No.

50:05.419 --> 50:06.420
No.

50:07.504 --> 50:09.256
Oh, come on, I can't let you move out.

50:09.339 --> 50:10.340
No.

50:10.757 --> 50:12.009
Come work with me.

50:21.560 --> 50:22.686
Do you want that?

50:28.525 --> 50:30.777
I need a 20-million-dollar investment.

50:36.241 --> 50:38.493
So the board will keep you as CEO.

50:45.375 --> 50:47.127
You already told them you had it.

50:48.879 --> 50:49.880
Yes.

50:54.843 --> 50:55.844
Twelve million.

50:57.471 --> 51:00.098
Twenty. And you can be COO.

51:33.715 --> 51:34.758
I quit.

51:35.967 --> 51:38.553
Come on. Come on. Come on.

52:07.249 --> 52:08.917
She's suing me?

52:09.417 --> 52:12.546
Are you kidding?
Nah, I'm not taking those.

52:12.796 --> 52:17.425
I am not taking those. Hey! Hey!

52:24.015 --> 52:27.978
And by the end of 2008,
Sunny Balwani came along as COO,

52:28.728 --> 52:30.856
and you bought back some shares
of the company.

52:32.107 --> 52:33.859
Yes, I had a controlling stake.

52:39.990 --> 52:40.991
Ready?

54:19.631 --> 54:20.924
<i>I want to be a billionaire.</i>

54:22.842 --> 54:25.428
ELIZABETH:<i> It's not about the money.</i>
<i>You have to have a purpose.</i>

54:25.845 --> 54:28.306
- What are you afraid of?
-<i>I can't do one thing wrong.</i>

54:28.682 --> 54:30.684
<i>I can't give them one reason</i>
<i>to doubt me.</i>

54:32.227 --> 54:34.562
<i>I'm gonna be on the cutting edge</i>
<i>of healthcare.</i>

54:34.854 --> 54:36.773
<i>It's going to change the world.</i>

54:37.357 --> 54:38.566
JAY ROSAN:<i> Everything's changing.</i>

54:38.650 --> 54:42.070
These kids don't get bogged down about
the way things have always been done,

54:43.446 --> 54:45.115
<i>They want to change things now!</i>

54:45.615 --> 54:48.201
<i>We launch in 48 hours!</i>
We did it!

54:48.618 --> 54:50.245
PHYLLIS GARDNER:
<i>I don't believe a word she says.</i>

54:51.496 --> 54:52.956
<i>There's something going on!</i>

54:53.081 --> 54:55.208
Why are they not actively seeking
FDA approval.

54:55.292 --> 54:56.835
Her whole image, is fake!

54:57.627 --> 55:00.630
- You don't understand the business.
- And you don't understand the science!

55:01.006 --> 55:03.341
ELIZABETH:<i> This isn't just my company,</i>
<i>this is who I am.</i>

55:03.800 --> 55:06.386
There's only one thing you need to know
about Elizabeth, she's a fraud.

55:06.678 --> 55:09.347
I know you want to believe
everything she's saying is real.

55:09.597 --> 55:12.100
The way Theranos is operating,
someone is gonna get killed.

55:12.684 --> 55:13.935
You're going to lose everything.

55:16.146 --> 55:18.356
No, I'm fine. Everything's fine.
