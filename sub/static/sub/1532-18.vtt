00:02.160 --> 00:04.162
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:04.320 --> 00:07.563
After five years in hell,
I have come home with only one goal:

00:07.720 --> 00:09.609
To save my city.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.489
Now others have joined my crusade.

00:12.040 --> 00:13.963
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.964
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.330
I am something else.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.686
Previously on Arrow:

00:21.840 --> 00:23.649
I want you to take my place.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.451
I want you to become the next Ra's al Ghul.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.886
- Maseo.
- My master sees something in you.

00:32.040 --> 00:35.362
Don't let your recalcitrance
take any more lives.

00:35.760 --> 00:36.807
Oliver.

00:38.520 --> 00:42.161
Oliver, we have to stop this guy before
he puts arrows in any more criminals.

00:42.320 --> 00:44.561
Or before he starts putting them
in innocent people.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.566
I think you're letting personal feelings
towards the Arrow cloud your judgment.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.200
Maybe I'm seeing things more clearly
than I have for the last few years.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.448
Enough, both of you. I am tired of... Unh!

01:01.080 --> 01:03.811
This is Captain Lance.
City Hall. Shots fired.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.962
Suspect on the move.
I need ESU and an ambulance now.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.889
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:24.560 --> 01:27.086
We have confirmation that Mayor Castle...

01:27.240 --> 01:29.242
...was pronounced dead at the scene.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.889
Palmer Technology CEO Ray Palmer
was taken to Starling General Hospital...

01:34.040 --> 01:36.247
...where he is listed
in critical condition.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.641
I tried to call Felicity.
She's not answering.

01:38.800 --> 01:42.168
S. C.P.D. Captain Quentin Lance
was present for the attack...

01:42.360 --> 01:44.488
...and had this to say on the incident:

01:44.640 --> 01:47.610
I just requested a first-degree
murder warrant for the Arrow...

01:47.760 --> 01:50.491
...and re-instated
the anti-vigilante task force...

01:50.640 --> 01:52.961
...with shoot-to-kill orders if necessary.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.329
Why would the Arrow suddenly
decide to assassinate the mayor?

01:56.480 --> 01:59.165
I don't know. But I should've
trusted my first instinct...

01:59.320 --> 02:02.802
...that this man is a
killer and a criminal.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.008
If I had, Mayor Castle
might still be alive.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.969
- No more questions.
- He could be right.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.770
Don't think like that.
We have to deal with the problem at hand.

02:10.919 --> 02:13.810
The murders are being orchestrated
by one of Ra's' lieutenants.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.325
Maseo Yamashiro.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.450
- You sound like you know him.
- I thought I did. Lifetime ago.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.806
The man is a stranger now.

02:19.960 --> 02:22.531
Oliver, the question is,
where do we find this stranger?

02:22.680 --> 02:25.001
I know someone who can help with that.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.640
Who are those men?

02:29.800 --> 02:31.006
I don't know.

02:31.160 --> 02:33.527
Then why are we running away from them?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.525
Shado?

02:41.720 --> 02:43.927
What? How'd you know my sister?

02:45.440 --> 02:47.169
Your, uh... Your sister?

02:47.320 --> 02:50.130
- My twin. How do you know Shado?
- Oliver.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.523
It's a long story. My friend and I
are in a little bit of trouble.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.126
Uh, we're wondering if you could help us
get off the street.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.721
- What's going on?
- That's also a long story.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.002
Can you help us?

03:02.560 --> 03:03.641
Okay, listen up.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.883
Suspect is armed and dangerous.
No warning shots.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.401
Whatever happened to innocent
until proven guilty?

03:09.560 --> 03:11.927
He was on that rooftop.
I saw him with my own eyes.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.730
- He's being framed.
- By a copycat.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.924
Wouldn't be happening
if he wasn't dressed up like Robin Hood.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.161
That's not fair.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.164
You don't understand what's happening.
I need you to trust me.

03:21.920 --> 03:22.967
I used to.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.243
- Who is he? Just tell me his name or I'll...
- What, Dad?

03:30.480 --> 03:32.005
You'll charge me as an accessory?

03:32.160 --> 03:34.606
I'll do what needs to be done.
This has to end.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.686
And it has to end tonight.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.807
I am the biggest idiot in the world
for breaking up with you.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.842
Remember the last time we did this?

03:54.280 --> 03:56.487
We were gonna run away together.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.208
Why don't we?

04:02.760 --> 04:04.364
Roy.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.408
Things are complicated
with Oliver right now.

04:09.720 --> 04:11.290
Ra's al Ghul complicated?

04:16.240 --> 04:17.526
Oh, my God.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.041
In the wake of the attacks, Captain Lance
has issued an arrest warrant...

04:24.240 --> 04:26.368
...for the vigilante known as the Arrow...

04:26.520 --> 04:30.491
...as the largest manhunt
in the city's history is underway.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.008
Captain Lance confirmed that
arrest warrants have also been issued...

04:34.160 --> 04:36.527
...for each of the Arrow's accomplices.

04:38.040 --> 04:39.485
Ray?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.325
H9)'-

04:43.480 --> 04:46.165
Hi. How are you?

04:46.320 --> 04:49.005
Well, you're here, so I'm great.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.167
Mr. Palmer, how are you feeling?

04:55.320 --> 04:57.687
You have a not-so-good look on your face.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.285
You see his face?

04:59.480 --> 05:00.811
I've got some bad news.

05:00.960 --> 05:04.442
During the surgery to remove the arrow,
you developed a thrombus.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.329
- A blood clot?
- If left untreated...

05:06.480 --> 05:08.687
...it could cause an ischemic stroke.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.525
- Then maybe we should treat it.
- It's not that simple.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.523
Your injuries have left you very weak.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.809
A craniotomy could end up
doing more harm than good.

05:17.000 --> 05:21.210
- And by harm you mean...?
- Brain damage at best.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.491
At worst...

05:26.320 --> 05:31.042
So you're saying basically that if we
have the surgery now, I could die.

05:31.200 --> 05:34.568
And if we wait and the clot moves,
I could die.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.527
What if I told you that I invented
a bunch of teeny-tiny robots...

05:39.680 --> 05:43.321
...that were capable of entering
my bloodstream, traveling to the clot...

05:43.480 --> 05:45.005
...and shrinking it?

05:45.160 --> 05:48.403
All without damaging my brain
or any other organ in my body.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.807
- I'd say you need a psych eval.
- Heh.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.086
Okay.

05:52.240 --> 05:56.245
But after, we go to my lab,
get the nanotech...

05:56.400 --> 05:59.802
...inject it, and publish the results
in the New England Journal of Medicine.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.890
Well, I'm sorry,
but that's simply not possible.

06:03.040 --> 06:05.168
Uh, I invented the tech. It's possible.

06:05.320 --> 06:09.689
Starling General has a very strict policy
against experimental procedures.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.525
Wait, there is a procedure
that could save his life...

06:12.720 --> 06:16.520
...and you're saying you won't perform it?
I'm saying I can't perform it.

06:16.680 --> 06:21.720
The hospital won't permit the use
of an experimental or untested technology.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.767
How do you know your invention
won't kill you?

06:26.520 --> 06:29.410
- I don't. It's a risk.
- I'm very sorry.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.603
But there's really nothing I can do.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.250
We'll figure something out.

06:49.720 --> 06:50.960
Ray Palmer.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.883
Even in a hospital bed, you're the most
handsome man I've ever seen.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.802
Can you give us a minute?

06:57.960 --> 06:59.485
Hi.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.650
I heard what happened,
so I caught the first flight out of Vegas.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.041
So tell me, what are the doctors saying?

07:15.600 --> 07:17.329
Absolutely nothing good.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.131
Okay, okay. Hey.

07:22.480 --> 07:25.404
At least you finally have a boyfriend.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.207
Mom.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.324
How did you know I was still in Starling?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.806
- Laurel.
- I need your help, Nyssa.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.320
Maseo is also in Starling.

07:44.520 --> 07:47.524
He's behind the murders
the Arrow's suspected of.

07:47.680 --> 07:51.082
Sarab does my father's bidding
in an effort to force you to do the same...

07:51.280 --> 07:54.921
...and take your place as his heir.
And do you feel betrayed by that?

07:58.520 --> 08:01.046
Not so much
that I'd betray him by helping you.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.486
People are dying, Nyssa.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.367
What makes you think
that's any concern of mine?

08:06.480 --> 08:07.720
Sara.

08:10.840 --> 08:12.808
What would she want you to do?

08:21.760 --> 08:23.364
I have Maseo's location.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.483
A building called Magnuson Plaza.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.405
Yeah, the company that owns that building
went belly-up a few months back.

08:30.560 --> 08:32.722
The League has been
using it as a safe house...

08:32.880 --> 08:34.484
...and staging ground for its attacks.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.880
How'd you find this out?

08:36.679 --> 08:37.966
I am Daughter of the Demon.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.842
Your primary concern
should be the League.

08:41.039 --> 08:44.726
You can place Maseo in the same cage
you put me in but my father has an army.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.564
- One step at a time.
- Oliver.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.321
We have to spread out
if we're gonna cover that.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.482
- Dig, I want you on overwatch.
- Copy that.

08:52.640 --> 08:54.768
What about her?

08:54.920 --> 08:56.968
Don't confuse information...

08:57.120 --> 08:59.521
...with the willingness
to take up arms against the League.

08:59.720 --> 09:03.327
We appreciate what you've done.
We'll take it from here.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.285
Let's do this.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.249
We scoped out every floor. Nothing.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.765
Same with the parking garage.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.927
- Diggle.
- North side is clear.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.326
You think Nyssa played us?

09:29.720 --> 09:30.881
Hang on, I got movement.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.805
Upper level, southwest corner.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.444
Clearly, I chose well
selecting you as my heir.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.923
Killing me will only win you
the mantle you reject.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.161
It will stop you.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.842
I have legions who live
only to see my will done.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.324
No, boy, you have but two choices.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.966
You either ascend
to the calling of Ra's al Ghul...

10:34.120 --> 10:37.283
...or you will spend the rest of your days
in a cage.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.363
You're not gonna take me prisoner.

10:39.520 --> 10:42.410
No, I'm not.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.327
This is the Starling City police.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.323
Put your weapons down and your hands up.

10:49.480 --> 10:51.687
You're all under arrest.

11:04.720 --> 11:06.722
On the ground. Get on the ground!

11:12.000 --> 11:13.490
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.411
Lock down this entire area.
Three-block radius.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.724
- Diggle?
- I got eyes on them. Blues everywhere.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.770
Suspects
headed east on 8th. Keep them pinned.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.651
Warehouse door. West side.
Get there, you're in the clear.

11:36.840 --> 11:38.410
Go, move.
Four more headed your way.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.210
You gotta move, move, move.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.482
Put your hands in the air.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.402
Go for the door. I'll draw their fire.

11:54.560 --> 11:57.484
- We're not separating.
- They don't want you. They want me.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.449
Now, go.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.607
Cooper, Jones, box them in on 43rd.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.201
Two masks in a warehouse,
west side of 43rd.

12:21.360 --> 12:22.964
Proceeding to warehouse.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.690
He's headed toward the east exit.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.125
This way. Take him.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.324
Laurel.

12:53.840 --> 12:56.764
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot your own daughter?

12:56.960 --> 12:58.610
No, but I'm thinking about arresting you.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.683
A night in jail would bring you
to your senses.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.360
Daddy, please. Please don't do this.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.444
- Leave her alone.
- Nyssa.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.604
- Don't hurt him.
- Laurel, what are you doing?

13:17.800 --> 13:19.290
We must go.

13:22.720 --> 13:23.801
I'm sorry.

13:28.520 --> 13:30.887
Did Arsenal and Canary get away?

13:31.120 --> 13:32.849
Diggle.

13:34.200 --> 13:35.486
Diggle.

13:44.880 --> 13:45.927
Get back!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.411
Get in.

14:00.400 --> 14:03.165
I see a black, late model
vehicle in the area.

14:03.360 --> 14:06.443
Get to the tunnel off 8th, we're good.
If we clear those squad cars.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.051
On it.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.245
H9)'-

14:42.440 --> 14:43.930
Thank God. I got so worried.

14:44.080 --> 14:46.287
It's okay. I'm okay.

14:49.280 --> 14:50.327
Where's Roy?

14:51.200 --> 14:52.247
He's still out there.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.086
- It's like the whole city has lost their minds.
- It's not the whole city.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.129
It's just one man.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.129
- Yup.
- Hello, captain.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.203
I got three men in the hospital
because of you.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.601
I understand that you feel betrayed.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.808
But you can't be so angry as to think...

15:07.960 --> 15:11.123
...that I'm just running around
taking aim at innocent people.

15:11.280 --> 15:14.443
I don't think anything.
I know this madness has to end.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.803
You don't want any more people
getting hurt, you turn yourself in.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.487
Yeah, that's what I thought.

15:22.280 --> 15:25.648
I'm sorry. He's in a lot of pain.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.811
I thought that if we stopped Maseo,
we'd stop the killings.

15:30.960 --> 15:33.725
But Nyssa was right.
This extends way beyond him.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.807
- Roy.
- I'm okay.

15:38.960 --> 15:41.167
I got clear somewhere around Hudson.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.209
I had to shoot a few officers.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.330
But they're just flesh wounds.

15:49.360 --> 15:52.170
I've underestimated Ra's.

15:52.320 --> 15:55.051
And now we're all paying the price.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.324
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

15:58.480 --> 16:00.767
Ra's is after us because of Malcolm.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.964
What don't I know?

16:13.480 --> 16:16.484
You haven't told me your names. I'm Mei.

16:16.640 --> 16:19.484
- I'm Akio. And this is...
- Tommy.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.885
So, Tommy, who are you
and your little friend running from?

16:24.080 --> 16:26.651
It's complicated.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.691
But, Mei, the truth is that I don't know
why this person has sent men after us...

16:30.880 --> 16:32.484
...but she did.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.043
Is that your father?

16:38.680 --> 16:41.126
His name is Yao Fei.
And how do you know my sister?

16:47.800 --> 16:49.165
Oh, uh, medical school.

16:50.040 --> 16:52.202
She never mentioned any American friends.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.845
You are American, aren't you?

16:54.000 --> 16:58.642
I dropped out. Of, uh, medical school,
not of America.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.883
So when was the last time
you saw my sister?

17:08.200 --> 17:09.281
It's been a while.

17:12.319 --> 17:14.288
For me too.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.685
Shado and my father disappeared
three years ago now.

17:18.720 --> 17:22.361
Police think they were kidnapped,
but no ransom came.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.285
I'm so sorry.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.805
The police tell me they must be dead.

17:31.160 --> 17:34.721
If they were, at least
I'd have some closure.

17:34.880 --> 17:38.566
But each time the phone rings,
someone knocks at the door...

17:38.720 --> 17:41.200
...or when I meet someone
who knew them...

17:41.360 --> 17:43.249
I can't imagine.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.891
You must be tired.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.209
Dirty. I need a shower.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.326
My bedroom's through that door.
There are fresh towels.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.129
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.410
I'll entertain your friend.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.121
Thank you.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.805
Listen, I'm a cop, not a psychologist.

18:20.960 --> 18:25.887
But in my experience, killers don't
discriminate between guilty and innocent.

18:26.080 --> 18:29.482
They kill because they view themselves
as being above the law.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.608
And the Arrow is no different.

18:31.760 --> 18:36.527
He is a criminal, and I promise you,
we will find him and hold him accountable.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.808
- It's real easy to look the other way when...
- Oh.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.450
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

18:40.600 --> 18:41.806
Thanks for getting this.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.970
I ran into Dr. Lockhart in the cafeteria.
I thought maybe...

18:46.120 --> 18:49.647
...I don't know, I could talk him
into giving Ray those nano-thingies.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.643
- Nanotech.
- He wouldn't even look at me.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.928
Have you seen this dress? Hello.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.764
Man's an idiot.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.290
Iguessu.

19:00.280 --> 19:04.126
...you're just gonna have to inject
those tiny robot things into Ray yourself.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.931
Great plan, except I'm not a doctor.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.841
Even Ray said that they could kill him.
I'm not gonna be the one to risk his life.

19:11.040 --> 19:12.610
His life is already at risk.

19:12.760 --> 19:15.650
You're saying you don't wanna
be the one to take the chance.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.643
- If your father were here...
- He would be arrested.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.444
Probably.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.324
But right before that,
he would tell you that sometimes...

19:26.480 --> 19:28.005
...we gotta take a chance.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.845
Particularly for the people we care about.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.401
I don't give a damn about budgets.
This is a manhunt.

19:38.560 --> 19:42.485
Now, approve the extra personnel
and the overtime, and you do it now.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.564
I apologize for the coarse treatment.

20:13.040 --> 20:16.886
I didn't think I'd get you
to speak with me of your own accord.

20:19.560 --> 20:22.689
- You're him.
- Ra's al Ghul.

20:22.880 --> 20:26.043
It's an honor to meet you.
Sara spoke with such love about her father.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.521
That's my daughter's name.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.484
If she'd never met you,
she'd still be alive now.

20:33.720 --> 20:36.007
If Sara had not met my daughter...

20:36.200 --> 20:39.044
...she would've starved to death
on the shores of Lian Yu.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.605
She was never on Lian Yu.

20:42.120 --> 20:44.930
You suffer false perception.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.125
One of many, I'm afraid.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.091
Listen, what do you want?

20:55.280 --> 20:57.089
To help the city as your daughter did.

20:58.720 --> 21:02.202
- You hunt for the man they call the Arrow.
- Yeah.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.445
Are you gonna help me find him?

21:05.120 --> 21:07.771
You'll be able to find him easily...

21:08.560 --> 21:10.927
...once I tell you his name.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.962
And why would I believe
just any name that you throw at me?

21:15.120 --> 21:17.600
Well, because with this revelation...

21:17.760 --> 21:20.445
...everything will become clear.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.962
And you will realize...

21:25.160 --> 21:29.165
...that the man you've been looking for has
been right in front of you the entire time.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.169
The same man who lied...

21:32.400 --> 21:35.563
...telling you he wasn't with Sara
on Lian Yu.

21:37.960 --> 21:42.124
Oliver Queen is the Arrow.

21:51.320 --> 21:53.129
We need to talk.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.326
Aren't you tired of these chats?
I know I am.

21:56.520 --> 21:59.967
Then let's cut the crap. You don't think
the Arrow's behind the murders...

22:00.120 --> 22:03.488
...you're just pissed off because he kept
Sara's death a secret from you.

22:03.640 --> 22:07.326
That is not why. That is not why!

22:08.480 --> 22:11.165
I mean, maybe at first. Yeah.

22:11.320 --> 22:15.803
But then I realized,
he is the reason Sara got killed.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.083
- Dad, that is ridiculous.
- No. You, Harper, Sara...

22:19.240 --> 22:22.642
...the freak in Central City, Huntress.
I got a new guy flying around.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.963
All these masks, they started with him.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.481
And Sara died only because
she was part of it too.

22:28.680 --> 22:31.331
You have no idea why Sara was killed.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.928
She ended up in the League of Assassins...

22:36.160 --> 22:38.845
...because she was marooned
on Lian Yu...

22:39.080 --> 22:41.082
...because she got on that boat
with Queen.

22:41.280 --> 22:42.805
So what?

22:43.160 --> 22:44.571
Now Oliver's to blame?

22:45.160 --> 22:47.367
Oliver, the Arrow. Either way, same guy.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.964
On some level, I think I always knew.

23:05.160 --> 23:08.369
When I thought he was doing good,
it didn't matter to me.

23:12.160 --> 23:15.243
You know, when that boat went down
and we thought Sara was dead?

23:15.400 --> 23:16.970
I blamed Queen.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.724
It's funny how things
come full circle, right?

23:26.120 --> 23:28.521
Well, I got things to do.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.205
You calling him?

23:32.400 --> 23:36.405
It's too late. I got officers headed
to his home, his sister's club, everywhere.

23:40.120 --> 23:44.409
Uh, for what it's worth, I'm thinking
of starting a reality TV show, so...

23:44.600 --> 23:46.364
...maybe I already have brain damage.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.005
Don't joke, Mr. Palmer.

23:48.200 --> 23:50.043
The next few hours are critical.

23:50.280 --> 23:53.921
I'm going to want to keep you
under close observation.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.366
1335"?

23:55.520 --> 23:56.931
No, no, no. It's nothing... Ow!

23:57.200 --> 24:00.363
I think my back is spasming.
Oh, it hurts... Oh.

24:00.560 --> 24:03.723
Oh, gosh, you're so strong.

24:03.960 --> 24:07.123
Ow. Oh, my God. I think I...
I think I'm gonna faint.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.282
- Maybe we should get you on a gurney.
- Yeah.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.410
Oh, yeah. I'll just get on a gurney. Ow.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.281
Ow. I'm sorry.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.368
Is your mom gonna be okay?

24:20.560 --> 24:21.925
Oh...

24:22.480 --> 24:25.802
I think she'll make a miraculous
recovery in about five minutes.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.805
- Just like you.
- Is that my nanotech?

24:30.040 --> 24:33.328
Assuming the organizational system
in your lab is accurate.

24:33.480 --> 24:34.766
Uh...

24:34.920 --> 24:37.241
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Aren't you?

24:37.440 --> 24:41.809
Yeah. I mean, my alternatives
are brain damage or death...

24:42.000 --> 24:44.765
...but if the hospital finds out,
you could go to jail.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.009
I'll take my chances.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.491
Okay. All right.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.723
- How do we feel?
- Uh, normal...

25:01.920 --> 25:03.410
...but I wasn't expecting any side...

25:04.800 --> 25:07.201
Ray? Ray? Ray?

25:07.440 --> 25:08.771
Hey! He)'-

25:10.640 --> 25:11.971
Hi.

25:12.760 --> 25:15.001
Okay, well...

25:15.360 --> 25:17.601
...maybe there are some side effects.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.807
- I can't believe this is happening.
- Line forms behind me.

25:23.040 --> 25:26.203
The citywide manhunt
for the Arrow continues this evening...

25:26.360 --> 25:29.364
...as Captain Lance has made
capturing this dangerous vigilante...

25:29.600 --> 25:31.728
...the S. C. P. D.'s top priority.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.803
I'm sure those cops
that chased you are fine.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.724
I shot them with arrows, Thea.

25:35.880 --> 25:39.248
When it was happening,
there was a part of me that...

25:39.760 --> 25:42.206
- That felt relieved.
- Relieved?

25:42.360 --> 25:44.647
That I'd finally be going to jail.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.882
That I'd get what I deserved.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.562
Roy, listen to me.

25:50.480 --> 25:53.370
The only thing that you deserve
is to be happy, okay?

25:53.560 --> 25:56.325
You've got to find a way
to forgive yourself.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.568
What happened with that cop last year...

25:58.800 --> 26:00.564
...it's not your fault.

26:03.640 --> 26:05.404
Sorry that you had to go through this.

26:05.640 --> 26:08.371
Roy, I gave you that mask...

26:08.800 --> 26:13.044
...so you could help the police,
not run from them.

26:14.080 --> 26:15.320
What's going to happen?

26:17.480 --> 26:18.970
- Oh.
- Run.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.565
S.C.P.D.!

26:20.760 --> 26:23.206
- Freeze!
- Put your hands in the air!

26:31.720 --> 26:33.768
Thank you for the shower.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.849
- You okay?
- I saw the tattoo on your back.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.326
Why have you been lying to me?

26:40.480 --> 26:44.451
- Oh. Mei...
- I need to know what happened to my family.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.609
- I don't know.
- Another lie.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.280
You knew my sister.
You were more than just friends.

26:49.440 --> 26:52.967
Just believe me when I say the less
you know about me, the safer you'll be.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.441
Fine, maybe you'll be more honest
with the police.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.602
You're upset. Please don't call the police.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.962
I already did. They'll be here any minute.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.964
- Akio, we have to go.
- What's wrong?

27:05.760 --> 27:06.841
Get down!

27:10.240 --> 27:11.651
Why are the police shooting?

27:11.880 --> 27:14.121
Because they're not the police!

27:16.440 --> 27:19.489
I am so proud of you. I'm so proud...

27:19.640 --> 27:21.483
Your father would be proud of you.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.847
He's not exactly a role model, but...

27:24.040 --> 27:26.327
Oh, Ms. Smoak.
Just the person I wanted to see.

27:26.480 --> 27:30.371
Do you know what these are?
They're Mr. Palmer's latest MRI.

27:30.560 --> 27:33.928
- The clot in his brain is gone.
- Really?

27:34.120 --> 27:36.566
Not moved, not smaller, gone.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.485
He's going to make a full recovery.

27:39.640 --> 27:41.483
You wouldn't happen to know anything...

27:41.680 --> 27:44.524
...about this unprecedented
medical development, would you?

27:44.720 --> 27:45.767
Huh?

27:45.920 --> 27:49.003
You accusing my daughter of something?
I work a table at Caesar's...

27:49.160 --> 27:51.322
...frequented by no less
than three lawyers.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.444
Thank you, please.
Thank you all for coming.

27:55.640 --> 27:57.802
We've had a breakthrough
in our investigation...

27:57.960 --> 28:00.691
...of the vigilante known as the Arrow.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.164
The District Attorney's office
has just issued an arrest warrant...

28:05.800 --> 28:08.167
...for the person responsible
for these acts of violence.

28:12.040 --> 28:13.963
I had nowhere else to go.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.525
It's okay.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.520
Lyla took Sara to her mother's.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.966
- Lance knows.
- The whole city knows, Oliver.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.846
Mr. Queen should be considered
armed and highly dangerous.

28:27.040 --> 28:29.691
But make no mistake, he will be found...

28:29.880 --> 28:32.042
...and brought to justice.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.644
A stunning development...

28:38.800 --> 28:41.406
...as Oliver Queen has been outed
as the Arrow.

28:41.560 --> 28:44.040
The accusation comes
as a particular surprise...

28:44.240 --> 28:48.165
...considering that Queen was exonerated
of being the Arrow only two years ago.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.566
News lady's right.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.882
You put this genie back
in the bottle before.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.082
Last time I had it all worked out.

28:54.320 --> 28:58.644
Getting arrested was my plan.
This time it's Ra's al Ghul's.

29:05.320 --> 29:06.731
Come in.

29:09.600 --> 29:12.365
- How's Ray?
- So much better than you right now.

29:12.600 --> 29:14.523
Please tell me you have a brilliant plan.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.370
I don't even have a regular plan.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.086
What about Dig going out as the Arrow?
Worked last time.

29:19.240 --> 29:22.050
But this time Lance won't rest
until Oliver's in custody.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.281
You have to leave.
You have to get out of town.

29:25.520 --> 29:28.888
My father's posted men at every
bus station, train station and airport.

29:29.440 --> 29:32.410
Also, he's frozen Thea's assets.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.722
He's not giving you anything
you can use to run.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.605
I can't believe this is happening.

29:40.880 --> 29:45.886
- You think Ra's planned this the entire time?
- He's using this city as a weapon.

29:46.600 --> 29:47.886
It's my city.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.885
Where you going, Oliver?

29:55.560 --> 29:57.642
Only place I can go.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.122
- Akio, you okay?
- I'm okay.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.527
- What's happening?
- Front door the only way in?

30:06.720 --> 30:09.485
- Yes.
- Get low, take Akio to the bedroom.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.927
Mei, they're coming to kill you too.

30:12.160 --> 30:13.889
Go, go! Come on!

30:49.600 --> 30:51.648
Akio? Akio?

30:55.680 --> 30:57.569
We followed them.
They work for Amanda Waller.

31:05.640 --> 31:06.880
Who is she?

31:18.200 --> 31:19.326
How are you feeling?

31:20.000 --> 31:23.721
For a guy who just avoided death
and/or brain damage? Pretty good.

31:24.600 --> 31:25.886
Good.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.208
But are you okay?

31:28.560 --> 31:30.164
It's, uh...

31:30.960 --> 31:33.531
It's a long story. I'm just glad...

31:33.720 --> 31:36.326
...that you're all right.
Thanks to you.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.729
Oh, I think your nanotech
deserves some of the credit.

31:41.160 --> 31:45.245
All I did was stick something in you.
You think there will ever come a time...

31:45.400 --> 31:48.085
...when everything I say
isn't some weird double entendre?

31:48.240 --> 31:51.130
I hope not.
It's one of your more charming traits.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.484
That and the fact
that you had the courage to save my life...

31:54.680 --> 31:57.365
...are just two
of the many reasons that I love you.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.084
Wow.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.206
That's a really nice thing to hear.

32:05.640 --> 32:07.768
Especially after everything
that's going on.

32:07.920 --> 32:12.084
With the blood clot, and the nanotech,
and the nearly dying.

32:12.280 --> 32:16.205
Speaking of,
you must be starving after all that drama.

32:16.400 --> 32:20.200
I'm gonna go find a hospital nurse
and get you some of that hospital Jell-O.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.768
Oh, my God. What just happened?

32:31.280 --> 32:34.841
- Nothing.
- Felicity. Uh-uh-uh.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.048
You look the way you did
when you were 7...

32:37.200 --> 32:40.124
...and stole your father's electronics
to make a super computer.

32:41.080 --> 32:43.970
Oh, my God. Did you and Ray
just do it in this hospital?

32:44.120 --> 32:46.202
- Did you just have hospital sex?
- No... Ugh.

32:46.400 --> 32:49.210
- I've always wanted to have hospital sex.
- Way TMI. Gross.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.447
What?

32:50.600 --> 32:52.250
He told me he loved me.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.562
You didn't say it back?

32:57.880 --> 32:59.450
Oh.

33:02.800 --> 33:04.450
What is wrong with me?

33:04.640 --> 33:06.404
He's brilliant.

33:06.600 --> 33:09.444
He knows the plot to every
Doctor Who episode, all 34 seasons.

33:09.640 --> 33:12.564
He looks like a Disney prince.
I mean, he's...

33:13.560 --> 33:15.324
...practically the perfect man.

33:17.160 --> 33:19.322
You don't love Ray...

33:20.760 --> 33:22.524
...because you're in love with Oliver.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.844
You don't even know Oliver.
You met him for, like, 10 seconds.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.331
I knew it in five.

33:28.600 --> 33:32.605
Honey, you lit up like Christmas
when he walked in the room.

33:32.760 --> 33:33.807
He's...

33:35.280 --> 33:37.203
...terminally unavailable.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.601
And that was before.

33:40.520 --> 33:43.649
- You haven't been watching the news.
- No, I don't. It depresses me.

33:43.800 --> 33:46.246
But here's what doesn't.
My daughter has two men...

33:46.440 --> 33:50.525
...who are both amazing,
which just means...

33:51.040 --> 33:53.008
...she has to make a choice.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.283
I want pictures of Queen
distributed to every officer, okay?

33:59.440 --> 34:01.841
No, a current one.
One with the scruff he's wearing.

34:07.640 --> 34:08.687
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:09.719 --> 34:11.722
Captain Lance...

34:12.840 --> 34:14.409
...I'm here to turn myself in.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.130
Cuff him.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.163
I got you 1O minutes with Oliver,
but let's make it five, all right?

34:35.360 --> 34:39.001
It would not look good if these reporters
caught wind of you meeting with him.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.286
Him and the three of you.

34:49.440 --> 34:50.771
Makes sense.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.125
You shouldn't be here.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.129
Oliver, neither should you.

35:07.320 --> 35:08.765
What were you thinking?

35:08.960 --> 35:11.247
- Were you thinking?
- I was thinking clearly.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.125
I asked Laurel to make a deal.

35:13.360 --> 35:16.443
I turn myself in,
and all of you receive full immunity.

35:16.680 --> 35:19.126
You know, Oliver,
you are out of your mind...

35:19.320 --> 35:22.449
...if you think we're just gonna
let you take the fall for all of us.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.245
I started all of this.

35:24.440 --> 35:25.930
It's my fall to take.

35:26.120 --> 35:30.648
And this is the best way to save lives,
including yours.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.804
So stop worrying.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.611
- I've been through worse than prison.
- This is insane.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.888
How could we live with ourselves?

35:39.040 --> 35:41.407
Roy, I'm just gonna need you to.

35:42.360 --> 35:48.163
The only move that Ra's has left me
is telling the truth.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.882
You have no idea...

35:52.400 --> 35:54.129
...how powerful the truth can be.

35:54.320 --> 35:55.890
Oliver, this is the wrong move.

35:56.080 --> 35:57.445
John...

36:00.160 --> 36:01.650
...you've followed me this far.

36:03.880 --> 36:05.803
All of you have followed me this far...

36:06.000 --> 36:10.847
...but I need you to follow me
just a little further...

36:14.080 --> 36:16.128
...until it's over.

36:28.760 --> 36:30.205
The bodies are taken care of.

36:30.440 --> 36:33.125
- We should go.
- Just give us a minute.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.445
I'm sorry about this.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.723
They tried to kill us.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.965
They weren't the cops.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.210
They must've intercepted the call.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.010
They're after you and the boy?

36:50.800 --> 36:53.929
- You knew my sister. ls there any chance...
- Mei, it's...

36:57.720 --> 37:00.405
This had nothing to do with Shado.

37:02.360 --> 37:06.160
You have no idea
what it's like to live like this...

37:07.840 --> 37:10.684
...looking for any kind of answer.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.323
You were right that I knew your sister.

37:18.560 --> 37:20.528
I loved her.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.688
I knew your father too.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.769
And your family...

37:30.960 --> 37:33.611
...they saved my life more than once.

37:33.760 --> 37:35.603
I don't understand.

37:35.760 --> 37:38.001
The people that are after me...

37:41.760 --> 37:45.287
They'll kill anyone
who knows too much about who I am.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.046
- But Shado and my father...
- Mei.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.203
They're gone.

37:54.760 --> 37:57.240
I'm so sorry.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.891
Thank you for telling me.

38:06.040 --> 38:09.965
For three years now,
all I've wanted is to know the truth.

38:10.120 --> 38:13.966
You have no idea
how powerful the truth can be.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.405
We shouldn't stay here.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.451
Thank you.

38:35.160 --> 38:39.165
This isn't fair. This isn't right.

38:39.400 --> 38:43.325
All Oliver has ever done
was protect people, help people.

38:43.560 --> 38:45.324
We can't stay here.

38:45.640 --> 38:48.166
This place isn't secure anymore.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.848
And then what?
We just bug out and allow this to happen?

38:52.040 --> 38:54.042
- Enjoy our new immunity?
- Roy, I don't know.

38:54.240 --> 38:56.163
I have no idea.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.607
If I did, you'd be
listening to it right now.

38:58.800 --> 39:02.441
If any one of us were in there and Oliver
was here, he'd think of something.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.927
And it wouldn't matter
what the consequences were.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.328
Lian Yu.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.644
What about it?

39:28.360 --> 39:31.523
This, uh, Ra's character...

39:31.720 --> 39:36.203
He told me that Sara
made it to the island with you.

39:37.080 --> 39:39.811
You didn't feel like
sharing that with me? Huh?

39:40.000 --> 39:41.650
I mean, I'm only her father.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.166
I was.

39:46.520 --> 39:48.966
When did you decide
you knew what was best for my family?

39:49.720 --> 39:51.245
I love your family.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.484
You got the right to remain silent.
Take it.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.128
Just ask me what you want to know.

40:01.880 --> 40:03.928
What do I want to know?

40:04.640 --> 40:06.722
Well, was it worth it?

40:06.920 --> 40:09.924
All the pain and misery
you brought back from that island.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.401
Merlyn, Slade Wilson.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.883
Wouldn't it be better if you died there?

40:16.080 --> 40:20.369
The reason I came back was to try
and save the people of this city.

40:20.600 --> 40:24.241
I hate to break it to you,
but saving people isn't your specialty.

40:24.840 --> 40:29.209
Tommy, Hilton, your mother...

40:30.640 --> 40:31.926
...my daughter.

40:32.520 --> 40:34.648
And now you're set on killing Laurel too.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.931
I didn't want her to be involved in this.

40:39.120 --> 40:41.407
I didn't want anyone to
be involved in this.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.204
But you involved me.

40:43.400 --> 40:45.402
You spent a year
making me look like a fool.

40:45.600 --> 40:48.126
You spent a year
making me your accomplice.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.248
You have any idea what you've done, huh?

40:50.440 --> 40:53.967
What you've done to all of us,
to the people you claim to care about?

40:54.960 --> 40:59.443
You've made us criminals.
You've made us liars and victims.

41:01.160 --> 41:04.243
You, Mr. Queen, are not a hero.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.570
You're a villain.

41:07.080 --> 41:09.128
But you know that, don't you?

41:11.880 --> 41:14.884
- What the hell are your people doing?
- I told them to stand down.

41:15.040 --> 41:18.283
I guess your word carries as much weight
with them as it does with me.

41:20.320 --> 41:21.401
Get down on the ground!

41:24.480 --> 41:25.606
Get down on the ground!

41:27.000 --> 41:28.729
You've got the wrong guy.

41:28.960 --> 41:30.485
Oliver Queen isn't the Arrow.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.490
I am.

41:43.280 --> 41:44.725
Behind your head!
