00:01.002 --> 00:03.675
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.937 --> 00:05.780
Just got
transferred from the Harlan lock-up.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.318
I'm Gretchen Swift.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.285
You know, there's a rumour going around
that a federal lawman was instrumental

00:11.345 --> 00:12.380
in the death of Nicky Augustine.

00:12.479 --> 00:13.480
No shit.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.721
It wasn't Barkley,
and I can tell you that for a fact.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.491
Couldn't wail to see me again, huh?

00:20.554 --> 00:22.033
Let Ms Brander do her job.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.966
Talking lo me is her job.
Who else's wellness is she here to check on?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.527
How long
have you been going with that marshal?

00:27.361 --> 00:28.863
I have an eye for that son of thing.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.317
Girl give you my message?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.253
Boyd's got another shipment coming in.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.984
He's striking up a connection
with the Mexicans.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.054
Well, shit.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.720
I come in peace.

00:51.818 --> 00:54.662
- What you want?
- I've got a job that needs doing.

00:54.721 --> 00:55.927
- What's the job?
- What's the job?

01:03.664 --> 01:04.665
Hey, where y'all going?

01:04.730 --> 01:06.836
- Nowhere.
- Gonna make some money.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.174
You in charge while we gone.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.339
You up to it, right' little man?

01:09.836 --> 01:11.008
'Course he's up to it.

01:11.438 --> 01:12.610
He's a man now, ain't he?

01:13.073 --> 01:15.679
- Look after Chelsea while I'm gone.
- You all right?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.854
Seem a little off the last few days.

01:18.211 --> 01:20.885
No, I'm good. I'll take care of everything.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.789
All right. Let me know.

01:46.373 --> 01:48.046
Five minutes left.

01:49.076 --> 01:50.282
I know.

01:51.311 --> 01:53.154
See, I know my guy ain't coming.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.294
In the beginning, they visit all the time.

01:56.383 --> 01:59.330
Then there's
work emergencies, sick relatives.

01:59.419 --> 02:02.059
Last week, my guy had a "flat tyre".

02:03.757 --> 02:06.260
That's why you
ought to rely on the Heavenly Mother.

02:06.326 --> 02:08.966
She doesn't ever forget about you,
leave you waiting.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.600
I'm not interested in religion, Penny.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.067
You interested in staying alive?

02:32.119 --> 02:34.497
- Ain't nobody here, man.
- Keep it down.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.000
Hey, don't be shushing at me, man.
Is you crazy?

02:37.090 --> 02:38.797
Talk as loud as you want. Johnny ain't here.

02:39.826 --> 02:42.204
He's probably
crossing the border as we speak.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.597
Shit.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.711
What do you want to do?

02:47.801 --> 02:49.678
I'm gonna do what I was always gonna do.

02:49.770 --> 02:53.718
I'm gonna book a one-way ticket to Mexico
and bring back my 25 kilos of heroin.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.286
So what about them?

03:40.654 --> 03:42.258
Hey, Raylan. Heading to the cafeteria.

03:42.355 --> 03:43.732
- You want something?
- I'm good.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.861
You sure? They make these
tasty little breakfast sandwiches.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.735
- Stick with coffee, thanks.
- Suit yourself.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.432
Which one of you
do I talk to about my money?

03:49.529 --> 03:50.564
Like reward money?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.575
- Deputy Givens handles walk-ins.
- What's that?

03:52.666 --> 03:54.236
- As per the chief.
- Excuse me, sir?

03:54.334 --> 03:56.746
Can you just hold up a sec?
7:00 in the morning.

03:56.837 --> 03:57.941
Sorry. I thought you knew.

03:58.371 --> 04:00.044
Art's got you handling walk-ins now.

04:00.107 --> 04:01.415
That's why you're coming in so early.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.545
- I really thought he told you...
- It's all right.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.178
I'm good.

04:07.214 --> 04:09.285
- Have a seat, Mr...
- Salmeron.

04:09.382 --> 04:10.918
Larry Salmeron.

04:12.018 --> 04:14.624
So, reward money.

04:14.721 --> 04:16.860
- Backgammon money.
Backgammon money.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.529
Nearly $250,000 you people took from me.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.863
Backgammon money.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.101
Have you heard of falafel, Marshal?

04:23.430 --> 04:24.773
Never cared much for it.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.038
Always found it kind of like
a cut-rate hush puppy.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.040
Mr Falafel is a backgammon player.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.545
They have written about
the man in magazines,

04:33.607 --> 04:37.282
and you could see for yourself
if reading is something you enjoy.

04:37.878 --> 04:41.724
Now, I believe I rival Mr Falafel
in my online backgammon winnings.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.625
Winnings which you and
your colleagues took

04:43.717 --> 04:45.754
when you shut down my website of choice.

04:46.386 --> 04:49.060
Can't say I recall having
seized a website recently.

04:49.389 --> 04:51.733
You people arrested Charles Monroe,
did you not?

04:52.058 --> 04:54.664
- Seized his assets...
- Hold up. Monroe?

04:55.562 --> 04:57.633
How's Charles Monroe connect 10 this?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.904
He's the one that owned the site.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.974
Am I making sense to you yet, Marshal?

05:02.068 --> 05:04.309
- Are you connecting the dots?
- What's the website?

05:04.404 --> 05:07.283
K-Y-backgammon.
Kentucky owned and operated.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.980
And Monroe had
a local IT genius working for...

05:10.076 --> 05:11.146
Well...

05:11.478 --> 05:12.479
There you are.

05:12.579 --> 05:16.026
Yes, as I said,
you've seized the site and taken my money.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.995
No, see... There's two L's in "Marshall".

05:20.320 --> 05:22.322
Someone's screwing with you, Larry.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.766
Pretty sure if we took the site,
we'd spell our name right.

05:25.258 --> 05:26.259
Well...

05:27.594 --> 05:29.665
Impersonating a federal agency is a crime.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.107
Probably an FBI thing. Tell you what...

05:33.300 --> 05:34.973
Or you could just leave.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.610
So you just let him walkout?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.548
Should have chased him down, I guess.

05:39.639 --> 05:42.711
Maybe winged him in the leg,
give us a blood trail to track him by.

05:42.809 --> 05:44.948
Money in that site
belongs to the Marshals Service.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.048
Been nice if you could have
brought him in for a word.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.457
Considering I found out
I was covering walk-ins

05:49.516 --> 05:51.894
from Nelson while in the middle of a walk-in,

05:51.985 --> 05:53.794
I think I comported myself admirably.

05:54.221 --> 05:56.292
Tim, did you not tell Raylan
he was on walk-ins?

05:56.356 --> 05:57.892
Raylan, you're on walk-ins.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.536
Per the chief.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.971
So, Monroe has this genius, TJ,

06:03.029 --> 06:05.509
who apparently lacks
the wherewithal to run a spell-check,

06:05.565 --> 06:07.044
operating the site for him.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.373
TC.

06:08.468 --> 06:11.642
TC, TJ, ACIDS. Whatever.

06:12.138 --> 06:15.813
What we think is, he cleaned out the cash,
puts up a fake Marshal site,

06:15.876 --> 06:17.913
and rides off into the nerd sunset.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.689
So my walk-in wasn't entirely full of shit.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.586
I'll run him down,
see if I can get more details.

06:23.683 --> 06:25.993
You already rubbed him the wrong way once.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.862
Better you go after this TC guy
and get his story.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.902
You sure you can trust me with that?

06:30.991 --> 06:33.870
I mean,
what happens if there's another walk-in?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.531
Well, given your track record so far,

06:35.595 --> 06:37.666
I can't imagine we'll fare too much worse.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.542
Does this mean
ifs me and the backgammon dude?

06:42.936 --> 06:45.007
I'm just saying
I'm more of a cribbage guy, is all.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.072
Get it done.

06:46.339 --> 06:47.511
Yes, ma'am.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.445
You gonna pay attention?

06:51.845 --> 06:53.847
Feel like I'm playing against myself here.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.053
Don't need to. I'm playing a girl.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.025
Shit!

07:02.088 --> 07:04.967
Might as well be playing
a four-year-old Romanian orphan.

07:05.058 --> 07:06.093
Shithead.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.466
Careful! That's a pro series!

07:07.560 --> 07:08.595
It's worth more than you are!

07:10.230 --> 07:11.231
What the hell?

07:11.298 --> 07:12.868
New client. Get the door.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.105
Don't you got enough going on already?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.235
Well, they said ifs an emergency,

07:15.302 --> 07:16.406
and they're paying through the nose.

07:16.469 --> 07:17.948
Now get the damn door.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.423
Hey, there. TC in?

07:26.246 --> 07:27.725
Damn it, Candace.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.452
- Come on in. You Kemp?
- Yeah.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.091
She do the website making with you?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.292
No, I do the programming.
She makes the sandwiches.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.568
Now, what can I help you with?
Denial of service attack?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.430
Denial of what?

07:41.628 --> 07:43.904
You better speak to Larry. I don't speak nerd.

07:43.964 --> 07:47.468
Are you the Mr Fleming that ran
K-Y-backgammon for Charles Monroe?

07:54.774 --> 07:56.651
Looky here! He's going for a Taser.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.279
Can you believe that?

07:59.179 --> 08:03.321
I will aim to use words of one syllable,
the word "syllable" notwithstanding.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.022
You shut down that site,
and you took my money.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.530
I want my money.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.827
- Federal government did that, man.
- But they didn't.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.465
Now, my friend here specialises
in making people pay their debts.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.933
I learnt that the hard way three years ago.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.939
So, my advice is pay up now before,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.946
as you and your cohorts might say,

08:22.002 --> 08:23.709
"shit gets hairy up in here".

08:23.803 --> 08:25.942
Like I said, the feds took it.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.385
"Thug life", huh?

08:31.277 --> 08:32.813
Now, this

08:32.879 --> 08:35.621
will probably lake that arm clean off.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.190
He took it. He took the money.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.355
God damn it, Candace!

08:41.321 --> 08:42.493
She's the smart one.

08:42.554 --> 08:45.001
Money's all just
ones and zeroes right now, okay?

08:45.725 --> 08:48.228
Look, it ain't like
I just got it laying around here.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.535
Now, you guys do what you want,
but you start beating on us,

08:50.630 --> 08:52.234
you ain't never gonna
see a dollar of that cash.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.572
All right. But the thing is,

08:53.666 --> 08:56.237
I've been recording this conversation
on my phone

08:56.336 --> 08:59.840
and will now be calling the police,
who will hear your confession.

08:59.906 --> 09:02.250
They will get me my $250,000,

09:02.342 --> 09:04.720
while you get anally raped in prison.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.813
$250,000?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.325
You only gonna pay me $5,000?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.383
A deal is a deal, Mr Kemp.

09:10.483 --> 09:13.259
Remember, I've got you on tape
threatening that girl a minute ago.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.097
Quarter mil, huh?

09:23.563 --> 09:26.169
We're asking your forgiveness,

09:27.233 --> 09:29.076
that in our misery,

09:29.669 --> 09:33.583
we have desecrated ourselves with booze

09:33.673 --> 09:38.588
or drugs or violence or men,

09:38.678 --> 09:43.423
looking for something
that was right here all the time.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.960
O Heavenly Mother, our mama,

09:49.389 --> 09:51.596
you hear us when we say it...

09:52.192 --> 09:53.193
Amen!

09:53.393 --> 09:54.531
Amen!

09:55.929 --> 09:56.930
Amen!

10:01.468 --> 10:03.038
You got any cigarettes?

10:03.870 --> 10:05.645
If I had any, I'd be smoking 'em.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.880
I'm Ava.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.152
I know who you are.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.583
Penny's been trying to witness
since you got here.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.491
You wouldn't give her the time of day.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.661
- Never really had any use for religion.
- 'Course not.

10:18.051 --> 10:21.089
Girl with your looks
gets along just fine out there

10:21.154 --> 10:23.395
without giving any thought to her soul.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.601
But I ain't out there any more.

10:25.658 --> 10:26.728
No.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.608
Missy, you are not.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.404
I've been listening to you talk.

10:33.099 --> 10:34.772
There's a lot of sense in it.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.839
You think I don't know

10:36.936 --> 10:39.439
why you're all of a sudden
batting your eyes at me?

10:42.242 --> 10:45.189
You want protection, sanctuary.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.153
Keep these bitches from stomping you
and cutting you

10:49.249 --> 10:50.751
and worse.

10:51.417 --> 10:53.192
So what if I do?

10:54.521 --> 10:56.523
At least you're honest.

10:59.259 --> 11:03.537
What I preach in here,
what I say in my prayers,

11:03.630 --> 11:04.802
I mean.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.273
You don't really seem to me like
you're ready to hear about that just yet.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.877
I am willing to...

11:12.972 --> 11:15.179
No, no, no, that's okay. I get it.

11:18.611 --> 11:19.988
But this ain't the '70s,

11:20.046 --> 11:23.220
when the Moonies and
Jesus freaks got a pass.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.891
The reason we don't get jacked with is

11:27.120 --> 11:29.794
we're the ones bringing in the drugs.

11:33.726 --> 11:35.706
Now, I don't hold with 'em,

11:35.795 --> 11:38.401
and don't none of us use 'em,
but we do provide.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.676
That's why they leave us alone.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.475
You up for that?

11:46.806 --> 11:47.978
What do I have to do?

11:49.375 --> 11:52.254
Got some coming in today.
Penny'll show you.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.087
I got to think it's dangerous.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.051
Only reason you offering me the job.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.153
It's got its downside.

12:00.486 --> 12:04.059
Like I said, Penny'll show you the ropes.

12:06.092 --> 12:08.231
Or you can go back to staring at a door,

12:08.695 --> 12:11.699
waiting on a man to save you.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.040
Somebody get me a cigarette.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.047
You get anything on
Hot Rod's bank account?

12:23.109 --> 12:26.249
<i>Nah, the old-timer's still claiming
we already got it all.</i>

12:26.346 --> 12:27.916
Yeah, well, he's lying out his ass, no doubt.

12:28.014 --> 12:29.755
I'll be back tomorrow,
and we'll gel him talking.

12:29.849 --> 12:30.884
Look, man, you already know

12:30.950 --> 12:32.122
if there's something to get, we gonna get it.

12:32.218 --> 12:34.858
I don't have no problem pulling a few teeth.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.757
So, how's Mexico?

12:36.856 --> 12:39.200
All the <i>señoritas</i> and tacos and shit?

12:39.626 --> 12:40.696
It's dirty.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.103
Hey, what's up, man?

12:42.195 --> 12:43.572
You got something you need to tell Crowder?

12:43.630 --> 12:44.608
I'm driving.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.267
- Jay?
- <i>What you mean you driving?</i>

12:46.366 --> 12:47.936
<i>You get me carsick.</i>

12:48.034 --> 12:49.445
Jay, I got to go.

13:03.650 --> 13:04.958
Where's Mr Crowder?

13:05.652 --> 13:09.259
Well, I'm Mr Crowder.
A different Mr Crowder.

13:10.723 --> 13:12.100
Boyd sent you?

13:12.158 --> 13:14.638
Actually, I'm here to outbid Boyd.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.333
I have something
I'd like to discuss with Mr Yoon personally.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.068
You think you can arrange that?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.411
You have the cash on you?

13:26.606 --> 13:29.450
First I see Mr Yoon,
and then you see the cash.

13:31.911 --> 13:33.754
All right. Get in.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.088
Just you.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.541
The price of admission.

14:03.042 --> 14:04.180
Ms Crowe?

14:05.878 --> 14:07.949
- Hi.
- Did you need to see me?

14:12.952 --> 14:14.954
Let me ask you something.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.699
What kind of moves work best on Raylan?

14:18.958 --> 14:20.130
Excuse me?

14:20.226 --> 14:21.637
I was just wondering

14:21.694 --> 14:25.665
what kind of things
get his motor going, you know?

14:27.133 --> 14:28.544
Are you joking right now?

14:28.634 --> 14:30.511
'Cause if you're not,

14:30.570 --> 14:33.551
I got to say, you sound like
you just stepped out of a bad country song,

14:33.639 --> 14:35.243
"I've got to come take my man."

14:35.508 --> 14:36.578
Funny thing, though.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.986
Those are the songs
that just get stuck in your head.

14:39.045 --> 14:41.218
"Ear worms", I think is what they call them.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.554
Okay, so you're serious, then?

14:42.648 --> 14:44.525
Well, let me tell you, I don't foresee you

14:44.584 --> 14:47.997
learning anything more intimate
about Raylan than you already have.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.727
Sorry you wasted your time

14:49.822 --> 14:52.393
coming all the way up from Harlan
just to give me shit.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.665
I didn't come up here to talk to you, Alison.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.866
I came to talk to your boss.

15:21.020 --> 15:22.931
Apologies for the precautions.

15:23.022 --> 15:24.763
Mr Yoon loves this place,

15:24.857 --> 15:27.133
does everything he can
to keep its location a secret.

15:27.226 --> 15:29.228
No apologies necessary, Alberto.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.375
After all, a man's home is his castle.

15:41.407 --> 15:44.581
We'll return your firearm
once we have conducted our business.

15:45.311 --> 15:48.053
And here I thought we were all friends.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.252
That's what we thought.

15:56.989 --> 15:58.730
He'll be with you shortly.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.238
Well, look at you.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.240
Even vultures can fly south for the winter.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.144
How was Memphis?

16:09.235 --> 16:12.148
Well, I'm afraid
we weren't there long enough to enjoy it.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.445
You want to tell me
just how it was Hot Rod tipped you off?

16:15.508 --> 16:18.512
Some questions
don't get answered till the afterlife.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.425
Good news is, you'll find out soon enough.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.656
How much money you got in that bag' Boyd?

16:25.751 --> 16:27.424
$700,000? $800,000?

16:29.422 --> 16:31.163
I am not the one in trouble here.

16:31.958 --> 16:35.269
In all my years of doing business,
this is a first.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.531
And I don't mean that in a good way.

16:37.630 --> 16:38.836
Mr Yoon.

16:38.931 --> 16:42.174
I want to apologise
for this unfortunate set of circumstances.

16:42.268 --> 16:45.272
Now' if you will give me
five minutes alone with this piece of shit,

16:46.038 --> 16:50.817
I will eliminate this bump in our road
and get us back on easy street.

16:51.777 --> 16:55.315
Your cousin here claims
he has vast resources at his disposal.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.691
To the tune of almost $40,000 a kilo.

16:57.783 --> 17:00.320
Why, Cousin Johnny,
I don't see a briefcase anywhere.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.525
You got a million dollars
shoved up your ass?

17:02.622 --> 17:04.693
He says he can have it here
with a simple phone call.

17:04.790 --> 17:07.498
Mr Yoon, if I hear
a deal is too good to be true,

17:07.560 --> 17:10.040
more often than not, it's too good to be true.

17:10.128 --> 17:11.836
It's not just the heroin, Boyd.

17:11.897 --> 17:13.673
No, I'm spending my money
on something else.

17:14.066 --> 17:15.977
Yeah?
What, is he gonna give you a reach-around?

17:17.569 --> 17:19.015
I'm buying your life.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.311
Mr Yoon, we had a deal.

17:24.143 --> 17:27.886
Now, I understand
your Mexican cartels have a reputation,

17:27.980 --> 17:31.018
but let me tell you something,
so do the rednecks in Kentucky.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.486
Well, I'm willing to take that risk.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.828
But until that briefcase arrives,
I won't be taking any.

17:40.092 --> 17:42.504
Now, if his money is good,
I'm going with him.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.907
If he can't deliver, then I'll lake yours.

17:54.173 --> 17:56.119
How long is this liable to take?

17:56.208 --> 17:57.744
The money's in bitcoins.

17:57.843 --> 18:00.722
I was moving it around online, you know?
Covering the trail.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.589
That is not an answer, dot-com.

18:03.015 --> 18:06.792
Six hours, maybe eight,
before I can turn it into cash. Why?

18:07.353 --> 18:10.425
'Cause there's something looks like a cop
just pulled up outside.

18:10.523 --> 18:11.866
You any ideas?

18:12.358 --> 18:14.269
Maybe your pal's call got through.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.365
Maybe you ought to go.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.105
All right, thanks for the tip.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.801
Come on. Get up. Gel up!

18:21.033 --> 18:22.273
Now, you get rid of that cop,

18:22.368 --> 18:24.211
and you call me when you got the money.

18:24.570 --> 18:28.211
I'm gonna give you eight hours
before I start blowing pieces off this girl.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.285
That's being generous.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.113
Go on.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.228
- How y'all doing?
What's that?

18:41.287 --> 18:42.766
Just said, "How you doing?"

18:42.822 --> 18:43.823
I know you?

18:43.923 --> 18:46.301
I'm Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.

18:46.392 --> 18:47.837
Well, I'm Dr Richard Kimble.

18:49.395 --> 18:51.397
- So, you're all doing okay, then?
- Yeah.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.075
We're just running a little late,

18:53.132 --> 18:54.611
- so if you don't mind...
- Have a good one.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.645
Yeah, you, too. Keep doing the Lord's work.

19:13.519 --> 19:14.998
- TC Fleming?
- Yeah?

19:15.087 --> 19:16.930
Deputy US Marshal Raylan Givens.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.161
I want to ask you a few questions.

19:18.257 --> 19:19.327
Yeah, I'm real busy.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.166
You didn't ask about what.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.671
How about I just
come down to your office tomorrow?

19:22.762 --> 19:24.799
How about I come in now, we talk about it?

19:25.431 --> 19:27.138
What, are you just gonna come in like that?

19:29.135 --> 19:30.546
Okay, dude, whatever.

19:30.636 --> 19:31.944
Seem a bit jumpy.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.442
Got anything to do with
that asshole I just ran into downstairs?

19:36.108 --> 19:37.451
Work emergency.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.514
About to become a civil rights emergency,
you just coming in here uninvited.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.183
You want to do a body cavity search
while you're at it?

19:42.281 --> 19:45.125
I want to ask you about
the website you ran for Charles Monroe.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.653
But now I'm thinking
maybe you ought to come with me.

19:48.154 --> 19:49.189
Hey!

19:54.627 --> 19:56.129
Holy shit!

20:25.591 --> 20:27.002
Well, shit.

20:30.830 --> 20:31.934
Wait a minute.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.035
How many legs this guy have, again?

20:34.100 --> 20:35.204
Just the one.

20:35.267 --> 20:37.076
Plus the prosthetic he took with.

20:37.169 --> 20:40.844
When he jumped out the window,
thus escaping the scene of a murder.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.083
He was surprisingly fleet.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.052
What about the guy from the stairs?

20:45.111 --> 20:46.954
- What about him?
- You think he was involved?

20:47.046 --> 20:48.252
Sure. Why not?

20:48.347 --> 20:50.759
Between the one-legged
evaporating computer nerd

20:50.850 --> 20:53.387
and the walk-in this morning,
you're on fire today.

20:53.452 --> 20:55.523
How is it Art's not in here
giving me shit on this?

20:56.355 --> 20:58.301
Hard for me to fathom
his passing the opportunity.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.428
Shutdown notice isn't on the site any more.

21:00.526 --> 21:02.403
Fleming replaced it with a link to his biog.

21:02.461 --> 21:05.601
A big, bold post about
how he just made this marshal his bitch.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.938
- I'll find him.
- No.

21:07.032 --> 21:08.375
Tim and I'll go after hop-along.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.040
You see if you can
run down the asshole from the stairwell.

21:11.637 --> 21:14.584
Guy threw his leg out the window,
jumped out, and then slid down a light pole,

21:14.640 --> 21:15.914
and then gave me the bird.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.615
Come on! I love this guy. Let me catch him.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.281
Not this time, Raylan.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.717
Is this "per the chief"?

21:22.782 --> 21:23.988
What do you think?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.585
Catch up with your boy, we'll give you a call

21:25.651 --> 21:26.959
before we bust down the door.

21:27.052 --> 21:28.998
Sure, I'll be right here on the edge of my seat.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.226
Hey...

21:31.457 --> 21:33.130
- Chris, right?
- Yeah.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.104
Is there anyway to put a reply on TC's blog?

21:36.829 --> 21:40.003
God, no. Technology
to reply to a post is decades away.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.424
Hello, Alison.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.422
Suspended? Why?

22:04.590 --> 22:07.366
Wendy Crowe?
Thought they'd be gone by now.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.773
So, you really got all that money?

22:13.299 --> 22:14.505
You best believe it.

22:16.101 --> 22:18.945
Well, I guess
old Hot Rod must be in quite a state.

22:20.472 --> 22:21.712
He's seen better days.

22:24.610 --> 22:27.181
That's it? That's all you got to say?

22:28.347 --> 22:31.658
Not gonna use that silver tongue of yours,
try and talk your way out of this?

22:32.184 --> 22:34.221
A wise man once said,

22:34.320 --> 22:39.167
"What is it to die but to stand
naked in the wind and to melt into the sun."

22:40.559 --> 22:42.539
Life we chose only ends one way.

22:43.696 --> 22:47.473
I been at peace with that
for a very long time now.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.245
Well, just so long as you know,

22:51.337 --> 22:53.317
I'm the man bringing you that peace.

22:54.974 --> 22:58.012
Well, I remember when you used to
bring me a six-pack of beer.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.854
Things weren't
always this ugly between us, Johnny.

23:03.549 --> 23:05.495
I guess we remember things different.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.822
Well, what about Jenna Wright?

23:09.822 --> 23:11.893
I remember you
crushing on her pretty hard in high school,

23:11.991 --> 23:13.868
and I went out of my way to set that up.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.367
Yeah, you did.

23:17.696 --> 23:19.835
And then you slept with her.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.346
Well, it wasn't my fault
you could only get to first base.

23:24.169 --> 23:25.546
You only gave me two weeks.

23:25.604 --> 23:29.245
Well, like I said, it wasn't my fault
you could only get to first base.

23:31.677 --> 23:34.123
Well, then, I will be sure to wait two weeks

23:34.213 --> 23:37.126
before I play ball with your beautiful fiancée.

23:39.518 --> 23:42.556
Well, I guess there's something to be said
for keeping it in the family.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.228
Guess we are going with you.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.968
He is yours to do with as you please,

24:26.065 --> 24:28.102
as long as he is
not killed on this side of the border.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.305
I understand.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.137
I cannot stress that last pan enough.

24:34.506 --> 24:37.077
Dead Americans in Mexico
creates a problem for us.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.184
I'm sorry things did not work out.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.250
Not as sorry as I am.

24:51.457 --> 24:54.461
Woman looked up
every court case my name appeared in,

24:54.526 --> 24:57.097
mapping out a "pattern of misconduct".

24:57.162 --> 25:00.268
And then she pulled out some chicken shit
pot arrest from five years back.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.709
Got overturned.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.711
- Then there's you.
- Me?

25:04.203 --> 25:05.876
It doesn't look good, you and me,

25:05.971 --> 25:08.781
especially after you went down there
and punched Danny Crowe in the face.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.980
That was Rachel. That was not me.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.182
Well, then you should
call my boss and let her know.

25:13.278 --> 25:14.780
I'm sure that'll make all the difference.

25:15.314 --> 25:16.657
Two weeks, huh?

25:16.715 --> 25:18.490
- Yeah.
- I could use two weeks off.

25:18.784 --> 25:19.956
That's funny.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.522
- Gives me plenty of time to make it up to you.
- Sure.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.696
Excuse me. Would you close us out?

25:24.790 --> 25:25.894
- Sure.
- Thank you.

25:27.793 --> 25:30.637
I'm seeing some friends.
Want to try and cheer me up.

25:30.996 --> 25:33.033
How about I just
come over with a bottle of Blanton's

25:33.132 --> 25:34.873
and cheer you up the old-fashioned way?

25:36.135 --> 25:37.079
What?

25:37.169 --> 25:39.240
She said she was gonna
alienate your affection

25:39.338 --> 25:41.249
by working her feminine wiles.

25:41.340 --> 25:42.819
I'd like to see her try.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.513
Meaning she doesn't have a hope in hell

25:44.576 --> 25:46.419
or you would like to see her try?

25:46.512 --> 25:47.650
Not my type.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.750
Criminal family, tramp stamp,

25:49.848 --> 25:51.486
I thought that was exactly your type.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.995
Tramp stamp?

25:54.186 --> 25:57.167
Mr Givens, I'm sorry,
but your card was declined.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.025
That's odd.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.196
The message on the screen said to destroy it.

26:02.094 --> 26:03.505
I'm a deputy US marshal.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.235
I can promise you it ain't stolen.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.332
I'm afraid I'm still gonna have to destroy it.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.876
Yet you brought it back to the table anyway?

26:09.935 --> 26:11.573
And I still need payment for the drinks.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.375
Here.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.178
Thank you.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.411
I'll pay you back.

26:18.777 --> 26:19.915
So...

26:20.746 --> 26:22.191
You should probably get that.

26:22.347 --> 26:24.418
It might be the credit card company

26:24.850 --> 26:27.456
or someone with a tramp stamp
you never noticed.

26:30.923 --> 26:31.924
Givens.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.367
<i>You having trouble with your card at the...</i>

26:34.359 --> 26:36.066
Midnight Star Saloon, Deputy Dipshit?

26:36.462 --> 26:39.272
Hows it going, TC? Hows life as a fugitive?

26:39.364 --> 26:41.469
I just hope you're on a date.

26:41.567 --> 26:42.637
How's it feel?

26:42.734 --> 26:44.941
Look like a chump twice in one day?

26:45.037 --> 26:46.209
How'd you get my number?

26:46.405 --> 26:48.248
Man, I've been phone phreaking
since I was 14.

26:48.307 --> 26:49.581
I don't know what that is,

26:49.641 --> 26:51.712
but I'm guessing
it means you weren't getting laid much.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.447
I just drained
every one of your bank accounts, asshole.

26:54.546 --> 26:57.618
Now, you want that money back,
you stop screwing up my life.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.286
<i>It ain't like
you're ever gonna catch me, anyway.</i>

26:59.384 --> 27:02.763
Are you kidding? We got a special squad
for chasing guys like you.

27:03.388 --> 27:04.799
Deputies all missing limbs,

27:04.890 --> 27:05.994
<i>make it fair.</i>

27:06.458 --> 27:08.597
Yeah, you're giving up already, though, huh?

27:08.961 --> 27:10.463
At that bar, having a beer.

27:10.829 --> 27:12.103
Several beers.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.302
You an alcoholic, Deputy?

27:13.398 --> 27:15.002
I told you I was gonna get you tomorrow.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.408
I'll make it tonight if you'd like.

27:16.768 --> 27:18.145
Well, come and get me.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.513
Phone call you received
was made over the internet,

27:20.606 --> 27:23.610
and apparently
the guy's using Wi-Fi from the hotel he's at.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.148
Kind of stupid of him, ain't it?

27:25.244 --> 27:27.451
The guy's got skill enough
to empty your bank account at will.

27:27.513 --> 27:29.686
He wasn't stupid, he'd be Sieve Jobs, right?

27:29.781 --> 27:31.988
Anyway, Chris traced it back to his room.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.258
Am I done?

27:36.155 --> 27:37.998
Fugitive task force is on its way.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.331
Tell them not to do shit until I get there.

27:40.425 --> 27:41.836
Told TC I was gonna get him tonight.

27:41.927 --> 27:44.271
It's gonna be me coming through that door.

27:51.970 --> 27:53.608
- Hey, Wendy.
- Hey, what's up?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.379
I need to talk to you about something.

27:55.474 --> 27:56.680
Look, I know I just got back,

27:56.775 --> 27:59.847
but it turns out I have to make a U-turn,
head back up to Lexington, and fast.

27:59.945 --> 28:01.447
Is it important?

28:02.814 --> 28:04.623
- No.
- All right. We'll talk later.

28:07.819 --> 28:09.662
Get your damn hands off that bottle.

28:10.956 --> 28:12.799
There wasn't nobody here.
What am I 'posed to do?

28:13.358 --> 28:15.065
Man, go get a hand job or something.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.798
I'll get you in a minute.

28:25.571 --> 28:27.346
- Yeah?
- Hey, Uncle Jack?

28:27.406 --> 28:29.716
It's Kendal. And don't say, "Kendal who?"

28:29.808 --> 28:31.981
That joke ain't been funny since I was six.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.387
<i>How are you, kiddo?</i>

28:33.478 --> 28:35.151
I'm good, I guess.

28:36.748 --> 28:40.025
I was wondering where you were living now.
Anywhere near Kentucky?

28:48.927 --> 28:50.406
This is Ava.

28:50.495 --> 28:52.702
She's gonna be taking over for me,
starting next week.

28:53.699 --> 28:55.372
Milam met you yet?

28:55.701 --> 28:57.237
What am I, dog shit?

28:58.270 --> 29:00.045
No, Penny. No, you're just...

29:00.105 --> 29:02.517
You know, meeting someone new.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.180
It's a pleasure to meet you, Rhyner.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.087
And so professional.

29:06.345 --> 29:07.619
Hey, Rhymes.

29:09.615 --> 29:11.617
- You didn't have to do that.
- Yeah, I know.

29:11.717 --> 29:13.424
You're Ava Crowder, right?

29:13.518 --> 29:15.293
- Yep.
- Yeah, I been seeing you around.

29:15.621 --> 29:16.895
Looking forward to working with you.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.693
All right, Penny,
guess this is that farewell lap.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.409
You can go ahead and take the stuff
to Judith. I'll be right behind you.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.308
- He doesn't take long.
- Hey.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.039
This is every time?

29:32.571 --> 29:34.312
Don't worry. He's a nice guy.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.909
It's real big, but you'll get used to it.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.594
All right.

29:48.754 --> 29:51.735
Here you go, Ava.

29:57.095 --> 30:00.565
You sure you can't stay for a little bit?

30:02.067 --> 30:04.138
Yeah. I got to run.

30:05.737 --> 30:06.841
All right, then.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.500
<i>Too bad you had to make the trip out to...</i>

30:24.589 --> 30:26.330
I never been on a sailboat.

30:26.425 --> 30:29.872
Motorboats, rowboats, sure, no problem.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.774
But I figured, "Hey, how hard could it be?"

30:33.198 --> 30:34.700
How about you?

30:35.334 --> 30:36.813
You like the ocean?

30:36.868 --> 30:38.279
No, I think it's lame.

30:39.871 --> 30:41.009
'Cause you've never been.

30:41.106 --> 30:42.949
I was born in Virginia Beach.

30:44.276 --> 30:45.346
Yeah.

30:47.145 --> 30:49.785
Maybe we ought to swing by there
and see your parents.

30:50.716 --> 30:52.957
You can introduce them
to your new boyfriend.

30:53.785 --> 30:55.128
He got all his pans.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.732
Speak of the devil.

31:03.795 --> 31:06.867
- US Marshals!
- Got to do me like that for, man?

31:10.135 --> 31:11.170
Where's Fleming?

31:11.236 --> 31:12.806
How the hell should I know?

31:12.871 --> 31:14.214
He made a call from this room.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.582
- Well, he ain't here.
- Shit.

31:17.342 --> 31:19.322
He's the only reason I came.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.390
Yeah. Yeah.

31:25.984 --> 31:28.157
Yeah, I heard you the first time. Okay.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.992
You ever notice Chris is kind of a dick?

31:34.092 --> 31:37.369
All right. Well, he says
TC Fleming hacked the phone system,

31:37.429 --> 31:39.875
made it look like the call came from here.
He could be anywhere.

31:40.031 --> 31:42.568
Told me he was
"phone phreaking" since he was 14.

31:42.667 --> 31:44.078
Sounds like a real winner.

31:44.169 --> 31:45.409
He do that to your arm,

31:45.504 --> 31:47.381
or are you gonna tell me
the big, ugly guy there did it?

31:48.039 --> 31:49.245
Don't hear me complaining.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.412
You ain't tired of getting knocked around?

31:51.510 --> 31:52.750
Shit, no.

31:52.844 --> 31:54.187
I give as good as I get.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.726
But I will tell you where he is.

31:57.849 --> 32:01.558
See, time to time,
I do coding for TC, proof his html.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.395
I'm pretty good.

32:04.289 --> 32:07.031
This guy Kemp comes in
with a shitty attitude,

32:07.092 --> 32:09.698
TC tells him I make the sandwiches.

32:11.196 --> 32:13.403
That's when I decided he was an asshole.

32:17.035 --> 32:19.072
God damn it. Grandma, Hold you!

32:20.372 --> 32:22.716
Surprised you picked
a basement to hide out in.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.549
Got no window to jump out of.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.486
That bitch.

32:26.578 --> 32:27.784
Well, if you're talking about Grandma,

32:27.879 --> 32:29.051
she's actually kind of a hard-ass.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.821
Told us she hadn't seen you in weeks.

32:30.916 --> 32:32.327
It was Candace that gave you up.

32:32.417 --> 32:33.828
Let's go. Up you go.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.591
No, no, no. We're gonna hold on to that.

32:38.723 --> 32:40.464
This could be used as a weapon.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.311
I can't believe she gave me up.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.250
I did send y'all to her rescue.

32:54.473 --> 32:57.283
Said you disrespected her computer skills.

32:57.342 --> 32:59.788
What skills? She's a shitty coder.

33:01.580 --> 33:02.752
How'd you lose your leg?

33:03.348 --> 33:05.021
Cancer when I was 14.

33:06.151 --> 33:07.596
How much time you think
I'm looking at here?

33:08.286 --> 33:10.766
I don't sentence you. I just take you to jail.

33:11.256 --> 33:14.669
Man, I should have just run off with
that money as soon as I had it.

33:14.759 --> 33:18.002
You already went on a shopping spree,
judging by your place.

33:18.096 --> 33:19.803
What, you mean all the TVs and shit?

33:19.865 --> 33:21.503
No, I won all that stuff, man.

33:22.434 --> 33:23.435
<i>The Price is Right?</i>

33:23.835 --> 33:24.939
I'm caller number seven.

33:25.470 --> 33:26.471
What?

33:26.838 --> 33:30.217
You know, radio stations
that give shit away, and they're like,

33:30.308 --> 33:33.346
"Caller number seven wins a TV',
or, "Caller nine gets a car“.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.948
Well, I'm always caller number seven.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.957
The "phone phreaking" thing, huh?

33:39.217 --> 33:41.128
Hey, you know,
I'm gonna get you all your money back.

33:41.453 --> 33:44.696
I'm gonna fix all your credit cards
as soon as they let me get to a computer.

33:44.789 --> 33:46.791
You think I'm gonna
put a good word in for you,

33:46.858 --> 33:48.462
you get me back what's already mine?

33:49.127 --> 33:50.504
Well, I don't know.

33:50.562 --> 33:53.304
Hey, what if I teach you
how to be caller number seven?

34:02.374 --> 34:03.819
Money's in the evidence locker,

34:03.875 --> 34:05.513
and they're looking
at that guy Kemp for the murder.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.049
Great.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.391
Art wanted me to tell you

34:10.482 --> 34:13.395
that thing with Darryl Crowe's parole
isn't gonna happen.

34:13.717 --> 34:16.494
The sister
complained to the judge down in Florida.

34:16.554 --> 34:20.331
Judge reiterated that
Darryl's legally free to move as he pleases.

34:31.835 --> 34:34.339
Don't feel like you have to knock or anything.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.079
You want me to go back out and knock?

34:36.174 --> 34:39.053
No, you're here now. Did you get your guy?

34:39.710 --> 34:40.951
You know I got my guy.

34:41.045 --> 34:43.583
Well, good. I guess we're done, then.

34:43.681 --> 34:45.059
Nice talking to you.

34:46.284 --> 34:47.524
Art...

34:48.453 --> 34:49.795
What?

34:51.188 --> 34:53.135
Is this the way it's gonna be now?

34:53.625 --> 34:56.231
Now until you retire,
I'm gonna be on shit duty,

34:56.360 --> 34:58.967
getting my orders "per the chief",
instead of hearing them from you?

34:59.064 --> 35:00.202
What if it is?

35:00.565 --> 35:02.545
Then I don't know what I'm doing here.

35:03.368 --> 35:04.813
I don't need this shit.

35:05.537 --> 35:07.744
Put me on walk-ins? Come on, Art.

35:07.939 --> 35:10.977
Raylan, if you don't like the way
I'm running things, you can always quit.

35:11.209 --> 35:12.711
Bullshit. I ain't gonna quit.

35:13.078 --> 35:14.113
Well...

35:14.212 --> 35:16.249
You're gonna
get back to treating me like a deputy.

35:17.415 --> 35:18.894
Or transfer me.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.057
Okay.?-

35:23.221 --> 35:25.292
I'll call Dan tomorrow,
see if he's got a spot for you.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.427
I didn't mean Florida. I meant anywhere.

35:28.426 --> 35:30.269
Anywhere that gets me out of this bullshit.

35:31.796 --> 35:33.002
Sooner the better.

35:34.165 --> 35:35.166
Okay.?-

35:36.167 --> 35:39.512
Well, I got one or two things
preceding that on my shit-to-do list,

35:39.604 --> 35:42.016
so you'll forgive me
if I don't process this right now,

35:42.107 --> 35:44.610
while you're standing
here in my office, uninvited.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.685
I got some vacation time.

35:48.480 --> 35:52.121
Starting tomorrow,
I'm gonna go down to Florida, see my kid.

35:52.183 --> 35:53.594
When I get back...

35:54.452 --> 35:55.658
One or the other.

35:57.922 --> 35:59.833
Going to see your kid, huh?

36:00.592 --> 36:02.299
Going on your own dime this time?

36:02.594 --> 36:05.598
No, Chief. I won it on a radio contest.

36:28.486 --> 36:31.490
Plumber got caught with drugs
on his way out.

36:31.623 --> 36:32.658
Shit.

36:32.724 --> 36:34.499
"Shit" is right.

36:35.393 --> 36:36.565
Keep it to yourself.

36:36.661 --> 36:38.072
Once word gets out,

36:38.163 --> 36:41.144
girls find out the heroin's dried up,

36:41.199 --> 36:42.735
might get ugly.

36:43.168 --> 36:45.409
What if I can keep it from drying up?

36:47.005 --> 36:48.985
That change the equation at all?

36:49.474 --> 36:51.385
You saying you can get heroin?

36:52.043 --> 36:53.647
That's what I'm saying.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.524
Look here.

36:59.150 --> 37:01.221
Girl bit me, took out a chunk.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.732
I knocked four of her teeth out after that.

37:05.323 --> 37:07.496
Got this one from an Aryan.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.163
Toothbrush shiv.

37:09.828 --> 37:12.331
Not your friend Gretchen. Before her time.

37:13.598 --> 37:15.908
Quarter inch deeper, and I'd be dead.

37:17.001 --> 37:19.038
I'm too old to live this life again,

37:19.104 --> 37:21.744
and you sure as hell ain't cut out for it.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.717
I got a few scars of my own.

37:26.444 --> 37:28.549
You say you can get the dope,

37:29.414 --> 37:30.859
you better be right.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.791
Just remember,
the hardest part ain't getting the drugs.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.526
It's getting them inside.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.702
And maybe it's a coincidence,

37:44.562 --> 37:49.136
Rhyner gets busted
the day I introduce the two of you.

37:51.202 --> 37:55.446
I hope to God Almighty
you didn't risk all our lives

37:55.540 --> 37:58.043
to keep from having to screw a guard.

38:10.155 --> 38:12.465
You really can get the dope...

38:13.224 --> 38:14.965
I might have a way to get it in.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.984
Aren't you tired
of cleaning up Darryl's messes?

38:31.075 --> 38:32.349
Well, we're family.

38:32.443 --> 38:36.448
I've been thinking family loyalty
probably don't go so far with you Crowes.

38:36.581 --> 38:37.525
That right?

38:37.615 --> 38:40.824
That's why you think
I drove all the way up here from Miami,

38:40.919 --> 38:44.958
left my life, to go get back my little brother
after you snatched him up?

38:45.089 --> 38:48.764
You cared so much about Kendal,
he'd be back in Miami with you right now.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.998
Just like how you're down in Florida

38:51.095 --> 38:52.699
with your little girl right now, you mean?

38:54.098 --> 38:56.169
- Know I've got a kid, huh?
- Yeah.

38:56.267 --> 38:57.439
I've looked into you.

38:57.702 --> 38:59.477
And I've looked into you, too.

38:59.938 --> 39:02.350
You've been
registered at some third-tier law school

39:02.440 --> 39:05.819
since the early part of this century,
never quite able to complete.

39:06.544 --> 39:10.048
I'm assuming that's 'cause Darryl
keeps dragging you back into his shit.

39:13.551 --> 39:15.224
I have to admit...

39:16.788 --> 39:22.136
I find your blatant abuse
of government privilege incredibly sexy.

39:27.298 --> 39:28.868
Help me get Darryl.

39:31.736 --> 39:35.548
He's in jail, means he's not in Miami,
messing up your life.

39:35.874 --> 39:37.911
You can finally finish law school.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.585
You really think I'd betray my family, huh?

39:40.678 --> 39:44.023
Sometimes it's best to out the anchor loose,
save yourself.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.392
Hell, Darryl knows that better than anyone.

39:46.484 --> 39:47.588
Why he killed Dilly.

39:48.519 --> 39:49.998
He what, now?

39:50.588 --> 39:52.397
Well, what'd Darryl tell you?

39:53.157 --> 39:56.161
He's living in a nice home
at some farm somewhere?

40:00.598 --> 40:01.668
Anyway...

40:02.033 --> 40:04.775
- What, so that's your offer, huh?
- That's my offer.

40:04.869 --> 40:07.941
Now, is that your final offer,
or would you like to keep negotiating?

40:09.007 --> 40:11.851
'Cause I've got
a table and two chairs up in my room.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.684
Booze, too, if you need it.

40:17.715 --> 40:19.752
You don't have to decide right away.

40:21.185 --> 40:23.096
Take a week or two. Think about it.

40:25.123 --> 40:27.125
And could you get the tab?

40:27.225 --> 40:28.533
Having trouble with my card.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.489
Here we go!

40:50.982 --> 40:54.088
Hey, big "D".
You boys want to do the honours?

40:54.152 --> 40:56.257
I can show my cousin what he lost.

41:03.494 --> 41:04.973
- Get 'em!
- Get back!

41:05.063 --> 41:07.168
Gel down! Go! Get down!

41:07.265 --> 41:09.074
Don't look at me! Get your head down!

41:09.133 --> 41:11.238
Don't you look at me! Get down!

41:11.903 --> 41:14.110
Get down! Don't look up!

41:14.639 --> 41:17.176
God damn.
You was in on this the whole time.

41:17.275 --> 41:19.152
Well, it turns out some people still give a shit

41:19.243 --> 41:21.746
about what kind of person
they do business with.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.584
Why didn't you just kill me?

41:24.983 --> 41:27.156
Because we wanted
to make sure we had your money,

41:27.251 --> 41:30.698
and like the man said,
no bodies drop in Mexico.

41:33.157 --> 41:35.660
Now, the rest of you

41:36.494 --> 41:38.770
are welcome to go back
to our original agreement.

41:39.597 --> 41:41.042
You get this product back in the US.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.271
You go back to working for Hot Rod.

41:43.601 --> 41:45.274
How does that sound right about now?

41:46.104 --> 41:47.674
I think we're good with that.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.444
I'm guessing that don't apply to me.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.888
No, cousin, it does not.

41:53.778 --> 41:55.780
You know, what you could never understand

41:56.347 --> 41:59.385
is that some men lead and some men follow,

41:59.951 --> 42:02.659
and when you can't lead
and you refuse to follow,

42:02.720 --> 42:04.495
you die alone in the desert.

42:04.822 --> 42:06.495
Just not this desert.

42:06.557 --> 42:08.867
Now put this piece of shit
in the back of that truck.

42:08.960 --> 42:09.995
Yep.

42:13.631 --> 42:14.632
Don't do it!

42:16.701 --> 42:17.907
No! No!

42:18.002 --> 42:19.208
No! No! No!

42:20.171 --> 42:21.514
What the hell are you doing?

42:21.572 --> 42:23.848
- He pulled on me!
- Why did you do that?

42:23.908 --> 42:25.512
I didn't have a choice!

42:29.047 --> 42:30.720
Good luck getting that shit out of Mexico.

42:51.769 --> 42:53.214
Boyd, I didn't have a choice.

42:53.337 --> 42:55.578
Don't you say another goddamn word.

43:02.513 --> 43:04.857
Tell Mr Yoon we have a problem.
