08:39.978 --> 08:42.856
Boy, seeing you

08:39.978 --> 08:42.856
and Joey together

08:42.897 --> 08:45.525
brings back

08:42.897 --> 08:45.525
so many memories.

08:45.566 --> 08:46.776
I'll bet seeing

08:45.566 --> 08:46.776
you brings back

08:46.818 --> 08:48.778
a few memories

08:46.818 --> 08:48.778
for Joey too.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.697
Yeah.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.697
I think it's great.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.949
You and Danny are

08:50.738 --> 08:52.949
still friends..

08:58.997 --> 09:02.209
Reminiscing always

08:58.997 --> 09:02.209
makes me feel like dancing.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.254
Patty, why don't we go

09:04.085 --> 09:06.254
down to my room.

09:06.296 --> 09:10.008
It's kind of hard to talk

09:06.296 --> 09:10.008
in the middle of a fiesta.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.760
Oh, come on.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.760
You look depressed.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.971
Cheer up.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.307
Read the tax code.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.810
So I moved in here

09:18.850 --> 09:20.810
to help Danny raise

09:20.852 --> 09:23.938
the three girls and everything

09:20.852 --> 09:23.938
seems to be workin' out great.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.442
You haven't

09:25.065 --> 09:27.442
changed a bit.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.194
Oh, Joey.

09:34.241 --> 09:39.287
Patty, just out of curiosity,

09:34.241 --> 09:39.287
why are you here?

09:39.329 --> 09:44.959
Well, I was married for a while

09:39.329 --> 09:44.959
and I just got divorced.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.796
And I started thinking when

09:45.001 --> 09:48.796
was the last time in my life

09:48.838 --> 09:51.799
I was really happy?

09:51.841 --> 09:54.635
When I was with you.

09:54.677 --> 09:59.224
I just wanted to touch

09:54.677 --> 09:59.224
that part of my life again.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.436
Yeah, there were a lot of great

09:59.266 --> 10:02.436
times, but, Patty, come on--

10:02.477 --> 10:04.062
Oh, Popeye!

10:04.104 --> 10:07.065
You still have

10:04.104 --> 10:07.065
the doll I gave you.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.859
Oh!

10:09.901 --> 10:12.529
You remember the first time

10:09.901 --> 10:12.529
you did the voice for me?

10:12.571 --> 10:15.490
Yeah, it was

10:12.571 --> 10:15.490
right after our first kiss.

10:15.532 --> 10:19.619
[chuckles]

10:15.532 --> 10:19.619
Remember, I went,

10:15.532 --> 10:19.619
"He-ge-ge! Whoa!"

10:22.997 --> 10:25.708
You know, anytime I need

10:22.997 --> 10:25.708
a really good laugh

10:25.750 --> 10:28.253
I think about

10:25.750 --> 10:28.253
the first time I saw you.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.588
Oh, no.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.090
Not halftime

10:29.629 --> 10:32.090
at the homecoming game.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.592
Yep.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.429
Fifty six thousand people

10:33.633 --> 10:37.429
waiting to see the crowning

10:37.471 --> 10:40.390
of the homecoming queen

10:37.471 --> 10:40.390
and there's this maniac

10:40.432 --> 10:43.351
streaking the full length

10:40.432 --> 10:43.351
of the football field.

10:43.393 --> 10:44.685
Buck naked.

10:46.605 --> 10:49.232
I was not buck naked.

10:49.274 --> 10:52.486
I was wearing high tops

10:49.274 --> 10:52.486
and a Nixon mask.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.491
I miss all the fun we had.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.701
It was a lot of fun,

10:58.575 --> 11:00.701
wasn't it?

11:02.287 --> 11:03.955
Until you

11:02.287 --> 11:03.955
walked out on me.

11:05.706 --> 11:09.085
How could you do that to me?

11:05.706 --> 11:09.085
You never even said goodbye.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.254
You just took off

11:09.127 --> 11:11.254
with Michael Winchester

11:11.296 --> 11:14.090
and left me a lousy note.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.634
Do you know how much that hurt?

11:17.676 --> 11:22.015
Do you have any idea

11:17.676 --> 11:22.015
what you put me through?

11:22.056 --> 11:26.269
Look, I wanted to say goodbye,

11:22.056 --> 11:26.269
I just couldn't face you.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.149
I'm so sorry.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.444
I still don't know

11:31.191 --> 11:34.444
why you left me for Michael.

11:34.486 --> 11:37.905
Because despite all the fun

11:34.486 --> 11:37.905
we were having

11:37.947 --> 11:40.659
I needed some romance

11:37.947 --> 11:40.659
in my life.

11:40.699 --> 11:43.077
I wanted someone

11:40.699 --> 11:43.077
to sweep me up in their arms

11:43.119 --> 11:44.745
and say, "I love you."

11:44.787 --> 11:47.374
I said, "I love you."

I can't believe you didn't know

11:56.966 --> 12:00.428
how I felt about you.

12:00.470 --> 12:04.683
Patty, I wanted to spend

12:00.470 --> 12:04.683
the rest of my life with you.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.982
You know, for ten years,

12:10.855 --> 12:12.982
I've wondered what it would

12:13.024 --> 12:15.734
feel like to hold you again.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.780
How does it feel?

12:20.615 --> 12:22.325

She must be in love with you.

17:50.987 --> 17:54.866
Joey, listen, there's

17:50.987 --> 17:54.866
millions of fish in the sea.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.369
Why pick the fish that you know

17:54.908 --> 17:58.369
is gonna break your heart?

17:58.411 --> 18:01.247
Danny, I'm back with Patty.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.247
It feels great.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.583
Now, why can't you

18:01.288 --> 18:03.583
just be happy for me?

18:05.125 --> 18:08.421
Well, maybe I have been a little

18:05.125 --> 18:08.421
down on this whole thing.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.548
A little?

18:08.462 --> 18:10.548
Don't you remember..

18:14.218 --> 18:15.511
I'm sorry, Joey.

18:15.553 --> 18:17.430
I just don't wanna

18:15.553 --> 18:17.430
see you get hurt again.

18:17.471 --> 18:20.516
Don't worry, this time

18:17.471 --> 18:20.516
I'm gonna do it right.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.643
Tonight,

18:20.558 --> 18:22.643
I'm cooking Patty dinner

18:22.685 --> 18:26.940
and I am going

18:22.685 --> 18:26.940
to be Mr. Romance.

18:26.981 --> 18:29.901
Well, actually that name's

18:26.981 --> 18:29.901
taken already.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.030
Oh, hey, girls.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.030
What do you want for breakfast?

18:34.072 --> 18:37.450
Uh, we just came to say

18:34.072 --> 18:37.450
that we're not hungry.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.494
Girls, wait a minute.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.494
Come here.

18:40.536 --> 18:41.996
You're wearing

18:40.536 --> 18:41.996
the exact same clothes

18:42.038 --> 18:43.456
you were wearing yesterday.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.958
So is Joey.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.921
Well, that's because I had

18:47.209 --> 18:49.921
so much fun in them yesterday

18:49.963 --> 18:53.507
that I woke up early, washed

18:49.963 --> 18:53.507
them and put them back on again.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.842
Us too.

18:56.427 --> 18:59.639
Hi, Tanners.

18:56.427 --> 18:59.639
D.J., bad news.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.725
My brother's

18:59.680 --> 19:02.725
staying in Reno for a week.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.853
You can't get the key?

19:02.767 --> 19:05.853
Let me at her.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.313
Whoa!

19:07.354 --> 19:10.817
Kimmy, did you handcuff

19:07.354 --> 19:10.817
my daughters together?

19:10.858 --> 19:13.486
Boy, nothing gets by you.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.613
Alright, no problem.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.613
Those are magic cuffs.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.823
Had 'em when I was a kid.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.825
Very simple.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.825
I'll need an assistant.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.534
Not you.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.534
Kimmy.

19:20.576 --> 19:23.412
Now, we simply place an ordinary

19:20.576 --> 19:23.412
apron over the handcuffs

19:23.454 --> 19:24.956
and the lovely and talented

19:23.454 --> 19:24.956
Miss Gibbler

19:24.998 --> 19:27.583
sticks her hands under.

19:27.625 --> 19:31.587
And...abracadabra!

19:31.629 --> 19:33.047
Alright!

19:34.924 --> 19:37.885
Hey, this isn't funny.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.885
Get these off.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.929
Mmm, I don't know, girls.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.929
Should I take them off?

19:39.971 --> 19:41.889
(both)

19:39.971 --> 19:41.889
Nah.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.474
Nah.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.768
Sorry, babe.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.521
Wait. Don't go.

19:45.810 --> 19:48.521
I'm stuck.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.026
Boy, nothing gets by you.

19:58.781 --> 20:03.077
May the magic of this moment

19:58.781 --> 20:03.077
live forever.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.453
Oh, how sweet.

20:04.495 --> 20:05.579
[clink]

20:09.458 --> 20:10.543
Hmm.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.631
You know what this spaghetti

20:12.753 --> 20:15.631
reminds me of?

20:17.050 --> 20:20.011
Come on. Remember?

20:17.050 --> 20:20.011
Come on.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.846
That's a little silly,

20:20.053 --> 20:21.846
don't you think?

20:21.888 --> 20:23.973
Oh, for old times' sake.

20:25.391 --> 20:27.143
Well, "Lady And The Tramp"

20:27.185 --> 20:29.937
was the most

20:27.185 --> 20:29.937
romantic cartoon ever made.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.313
Sure.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.706
You always make me laugh.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.586
Joey.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.462
Hmm.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.048
Let's streak.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.465
Come on, let's just

20:57.090 --> 20:58.465
take off all our

20:58.507 --> 20:59.884
clothes and go running

20:58.507 --> 20:59.884
through your neighborhood.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.261
Patty, I can't run

20:59.926 --> 21:02.261
through the streets naked.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.847
These people have

21:02.302 --> 21:04.847
a neighborhood watch program.

21:05.973 --> 21:09.518
I have a better idea.

21:05.973 --> 21:09.518
Food fight.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.771
Patty. Patty.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.774
Patty. Patty.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.777
Good thing I didn't make

21:14.815 --> 21:17.777
baked potatoes.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.404
Patty, I thought you

21:17.818 --> 21:20.404
wanted me to be romantic.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.281
That was ten years ago.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.324
I came back

21:22.322 --> 21:24.324
for the old crazy Joey.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.036
There's no old crazy Joey.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.036
There's only this Joey.

21:27.078 --> 21:30.248
Come on, you're still the same

21:27.078 --> 21:30.248
guy that always made me laugh.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.834
- No, I am not the same guy.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.834
- Yes, you are.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.128
No, I'm not.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.713
You don't know

21:35.169 --> 21:37.713
anything about this Joey.

21:37.755 --> 21:40.466
I work in advertising,

21:37.755 --> 21:40.466
I'm raising three little girls.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.176
I have a whole new life now.

21:42.218 --> 21:44.344
Why are you getting so upset?

21:45.596 --> 21:48.641
I thought we were

21:45.596 --> 21:48.641
falling in love again.

21:48.682 --> 21:50.726
Well, so did I.

21:50.768 --> 21:54.563
But I think, we're falling

21:50.768 --> 21:54.563
in love with the memories.

21:56.065 --> 21:59.318
Patty, let's face it.

21:56.065 --> 21:59.318
All we have is our past.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.361
What about our future?

22:01.403 --> 22:03.864
Joey, we're getting

22:01.403 --> 22:03.864
a second chance.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.075
Only this time,

22:03.906 --> 22:06.075
we could have a happy ending.

22:06.117 --> 22:08.869
Ah. I know.

22:08.911 --> 22:10.246
Patty, you came back

22:08.911 --> 22:10.246
into my life

22:10.288 --> 22:12.039
just like I

22:10.288 --> 22:12.039
dreamed you would.

22:12.081 --> 22:15.960
It should be perfect,

22:12.081 --> 22:15.960
but it's not.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.712
Let's face it.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.712
We really don't know each other.

22:20.214 --> 22:22.133
Yeah.

22:22.175 --> 22:23.425
I guess you're right.

22:23.467 --> 22:26.220
But in a way,

22:23.467 --> 22:26.220
it's still a happy ending.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.514
I got to say things

22:26.262 --> 22:28.514
that I needed to say

22:28.555 --> 22:31.309
and I got to hear things

22:28.555 --> 22:31.309
that I wanted to hear.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.144
And now when I

22:31.349 --> 22:33.144
think back about us

22:33.186 --> 22:35.688
I can feel good about it.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.691
All of a sudden,

22:35.729 --> 22:38.691
I feel like we're strangers.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.903
Well, we're standing here

22:40.567 --> 22:42.903
in front of two plates

22:42.945 --> 22:44.697
of spaghetti

22:42.945 --> 22:44.697
that are getting cold.

22:44.738 --> 22:48.326
Why don't we sit down,

22:44.738 --> 22:48.326
enjoy this beautiful dinner

22:48.366 --> 22:51.078
and get to know each other?

22:51.996 --> 22:53.371
Okay.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.541
Okay. Okay.

22:59.212 --> 23:01.505
Hi, I'm Joey Gladstone.

23:01.547 --> 23:03.799
Hi. Patricia...Fogerty.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.634
Patricia Fogerty,

23:03.841 --> 23:05.634
nice to meet you.

23:05.676 --> 23:07.178
Do you like, uh,

23:05.676 --> 23:07.178
Italian food?

23:07.220 --> 23:11.224
Yes, I do

23:07.220 --> 23:11.224
and this looks delicious.

23:11.265 --> 23:12.975
You know, the great part

23:11.265 --> 23:12.975
about it is that if they don't

23:13.017 --> 23:15.561
deliver it

23:13.017 --> 23:15.561
within a half hour, it's free.

23:16.979 --> 23:20.107
He-ge-ge-ge!
