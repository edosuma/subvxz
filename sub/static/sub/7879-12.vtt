00:45.385 --> 00:48.131
Straight A's, Daddy-o.

00:48.297 --> 00:50.217
Nope. I don't see
any athletics on here.

00:50.383 --> 00:51.783
Yeah, I'm not much of a sports guy.

00:51.908 --> 00:53.101
I'm more of a good-grades guy.

00:53.226 --> 00:54.376
That's who I am.

00:55.579 --> 00:56.738
Hey!

00:56.863 --> 00:59.424
Son, good grades won't get you
anywhere in life.

00:59.549 --> 01:01.560
You only get places through
athletic accomplishments.

01:01.685 --> 01:03.362
Well, what about Bill Gates?

01:03.487 --> 01:05.914
Before he blew out his ACL
and had to do computers,

01:06.039 --> 01:08.633
Bill Gates rushed
for over 300 yards a game.

01:08.758 --> 01:10.402
Uh, I don't think that's right, Dad.

01:10.527 --> 01:12.270
And I don't know
the recipe for apple pie,

01:12.395 --> 01:14.380
but that didn't stop me
from making one.

01:16.409 --> 01:17.459
Now, while that cools,

01:17.584 --> 01:19.001
come on, I want
to show you something.

01:21.038 --> 01:23.215
The Stan Smith Wrestling Museum.

01:23.340 --> 01:27.045
Dedicated to the high school
wrestling career of Stan Smith.

01:27.211 --> 01:29.988
Um, I've lived in this
house my whole life.

01:30.113 --> 01:31.223
How long's this been here?

01:31.507 --> 01:34.026
Construction of the museum
began in 1998.

01:34.151 --> 01:36.361
I should know because,
like Ross on <i>Friends,</i>

01:36.486 --> 01:37.796
I'm a docent.

01:37.921 --> 01:40.298
But unlike Ross,
I don't look like a Monchichi.

01:40.423 --> 01:42.467
I take the tour every day.

01:42.592 --> 01:45.303
Except for Sundays,
when the tour is free

01:45.428 --> 01:47.572
and the place gets a little...

01:47.697 --> 01:49.401
ethnic.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.660
Steve, I was once
a loser just like you.

01:51.785 --> 01:53.113
Hurtful.

01:53.279 --> 01:55.247
Then, in my junior year,
I took up wrestling.

01:55.372 --> 01:57.349
It changed my life.

01:57.474 --> 02:00.435
I went from zero to hero to De Niro.

02:00.560 --> 02:04.750
"You talkin' to me?
You talkin' to me?"

02:04.916 --> 02:06.585
Uh...

02:06.751 --> 02:08.877
And the ultimate testament
to my greatness

02:09.002 --> 02:11.380
is the state record I still hold.

02:11.505 --> 02:13.739
20 wins in a row.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.986
And no one's even come close
to beating it.

02:18.111 --> 02:19.855
Yep, that record there is the mark

02:19.980 --> 02:21.490
I've made on this Earth.

02:21.615 --> 02:24.192
And when I'm gone, it will remain.

02:24.317 --> 02:26.228
Without it, I am nothing.

02:26.353 --> 02:29.064
I certainly wouldn't have
a great piece of ass like this.

02:30.590 --> 02:32.934
You know who else
really appreciates my rump?

02:33.059 --> 02:34.326
Charlotte.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.774
The point is, if you want
to get anywhere in life,

02:38.899 --> 02:40.208
you have to join the wrestling team.

02:40.333 --> 02:41.643
Gee, Dad, that sounds great.

02:41.768 --> 02:43.412
Oh, no.

02:43.537 --> 02:45.847
The school doesn't have a
wrestling program anymore.

02:45.972 --> 02:47.666
Ah, squigglebottom.

02:47.791 --> 02:50.087
What? I am outraged!

02:50.253 --> 02:51.520
Well, take your outrage elsewhere.

02:51.645 --> 02:53.321
I have another group coming through.

02:53.446 --> 02:55.157
We'll exit through the gift shop.

02:55.282 --> 02:56.558
Make sure to check out

02:56.683 --> 02:59.435
our Stan Smith pan flute
rain forest music.

03:01.430 --> 03:02.781
Each song sounds the same,

03:02.906 --> 03:05.574
yet somehow manages
to be worse than the last.

03:08.437 --> 03:10.288
As many of you know,
the wrestling program

03:10.413 --> 03:12.109
has been defunct for several years.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.658
Ever since the former coach

03:13.783 --> 03:15.327
was caught teaching
a style of wrestling

03:15.452 --> 03:17.996
that would perhaps be
more at home in a prison...

03:18.121 --> 03:21.333
between a prisoner
and a weaker, prettier prisoner.

03:21.458 --> 03:24.569
But now an annoying...
I mean involved... parent

03:24.694 --> 03:26.304
wants to bring the program back.

03:26.429 --> 03:28.440
I give you
the most decorated wrestler

03:28.565 --> 03:31.476
in Pearl Bailey history, Stan Smith.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.713
Thank you.

03:34.838 --> 03:36.515
Anyone interested
in joining the wrestling team,

03:36.640 --> 03:38.007
please raise your hand.

03:41.711 --> 03:44.141
What if I said you get to do
stuff like this?

03:45.465 --> 03:46.608
Aah! My back!

03:47.977 --> 03:49.151
How about that?

03:53.290 --> 03:54.699
Congratulations, Steve.

03:54.824 --> 03:56.158
You and your friends made the cut.

03:57.486 --> 04:00.038
So I give you your Pearl Bailey

04:00.163 --> 04:02.097
varsity high school wrestling team.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.510
Um, just going back a sec.

04:05.635 --> 04:07.245
Are you saying Coach Keegan,

04:07.370 --> 04:09.114
who is now the baseball coach,

04:09.239 --> 04:11.418
(bleep) his wrestlers?

04:11.584 --> 04:14.143
That was a long time ago.

04:20.676 --> 04:21.959
All right, gladiators.

04:22.084 --> 04:23.728
This is what we've practiced
so hard for.

04:23.853 --> 04:25.230
Our first meet.

04:25.355 --> 04:26.531
We're going to kill them!

04:26.656 --> 04:28.033
Schmuely, remember what I taught you?

04:28.158 --> 04:29.534
Yes, Coach.
Good.

04:29.659 --> 04:32.147
Now, get in there
and destroy this guy.

04:32.438 --> 04:33.538
Oh, my God!

04:33.663 --> 04:35.774
It's not going well for Snot.

04:35.899 --> 04:38.043
Oh, my God!

04:38.168 --> 04:39.411
But don't worry, son.

04:39.536 --> 04:40.912
You're a Smith.
You'll be fine.

04:41.037 --> 04:42.547
He's lying!

04:42.672 --> 04:44.249
You won't be fine!

04:44.374 --> 04:46.451
Call my aunt!

05:02.525 --> 05:05.019
That tickles.
Tickles.

05:05.144 --> 05:07.807
Tickling. Ticklish.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.260
Timber!

05:24.407 --> 05:25.340
Nice, Barry.

05:25.465 --> 05:26.515
All right, Barry!

05:28.618 --> 05:32.874
I'm having trouble changing
into my street clothes.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.100
All right, Steve,
the biggest myth in wrestling

05:35.225 --> 05:36.795
is that you need strong arms.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.403
Like kangaroos and rapists,

05:38.528 --> 05:40.257
all your power comes from your legs.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.925
I might have said frogs, but yeah.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.298
That's why I'm going to have you

05:43.634 --> 05:45.076
run the Chimdale Stairs,

05:45.201 --> 05:49.599
the longest staircase
in North America.

05:54.177 --> 05:57.079
I was a child when I fell.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.560
With stronger legs
from the stairs, you can't lose.

06:02.685 --> 06:05.030
Not to mention I dropped you
into a lower weight class.

06:06.656 --> 06:10.203
I am not
showing improvement.

06:14.957 --> 06:15.834
Uh-oh.

06:34.801 --> 06:36.902
Who wants him to die?

06:44.828 --> 06:46.604
Your boy's doing great, Stan.

06:46.729 --> 06:48.673
He hasn't won
a single match all season.

06:48.798 --> 06:52.877
No, I'm talking about Badass
Barry the Butterball Bear.

06:56.165 --> 06:57.449
Named him myself.

06:57.574 --> 06:59.284
Took me 19 days.

06:59.409 --> 07:01.252
He's undefeated.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.822
Only three wins away from
beating your record.

07:04.089 --> 07:04.674
What?!

07:08.594 --> 07:09.828
Make that two wins away.

07:09.953 --> 07:12.664
My God, I've been
so focused on Steve,

07:12.789 --> 07:15.033
I... I didn't even realize.

07:15.158 --> 07:16.601
You know, maybe...
maybe Barry

07:16.726 --> 07:18.370
should sit out a match,
get some rest.

07:18.495 --> 07:19.704
No, no, no, no, no.

07:19.829 --> 07:21.139
I got money on that belly.

07:21.264 --> 07:23.274
25 G's he breaks your record.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.695
I got a bookie who'll
take action on anything.

07:25.861 --> 07:28.740
Oh, my God!
I just got my first period.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.048
Ha!

07:30.173 --> 07:31.516
Earl, you owe me 25 bucks.

07:31.641 --> 07:33.017
How'd you know?

07:33.142 --> 07:35.670
Always bet on red.

07:35.795 --> 07:37.172
Anyway, the boy wrestles.

07:37.297 --> 07:38.773
I-I... I really don't think...

07:38.898 --> 07:40.632
I said the boy wrestles!

07:43.820 --> 07:45.430
I spent a lot of time

07:45.555 --> 07:47.133
Photoshopping Reagan
into that picture.

07:47.466 --> 07:49.100
And for what?
For nothing.

07:49.225 --> 07:51.469
Stan, you're making too much of this.

07:51.594 --> 07:53.304
Do you think Corey Haim cares

07:53.429 --> 07:56.241
that Corey Feldman went
on to great success?

07:56.366 --> 07:58.686
No, Corey Haim's doing great.

07:58.852 --> 08:01.079
But it's the foundation of who I am.

08:01.204 --> 08:03.948
Without that record,
I... I'll have nothing.

08:04.073 --> 08:05.624
Charlotte!

08:10.163 --> 08:11.496
Shut up, Charlotte!

08:18.169 --> 08:20.500
What am I going to do about
Barry beating my record?

08:20.666 --> 08:23.273
There's only one thing
you can do: sabotage.

08:23.398 --> 08:25.755
You gotta take Barry out.

08:26.068 --> 08:27.244
Excuse me. Hi.

08:27.369 --> 08:28.912
Were you videotaping that?

08:29.037 --> 08:31.873
'Cause I'm sort of planning
a crime against a child here.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.933
I can't do that. I'm his coach.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.186
No, but I can.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.647
You... you'd do it for me?

08:42.813 --> 08:43.994
I'd do it for me.

08:44.119 --> 08:45.362
I'm a docent, Stan.

08:45.487 --> 08:47.464
If he breaks your record,
I'm out of a job.

08:47.589 --> 08:49.767
And I will not go back
to Relax the Back.

08:49.892 --> 08:52.536
I repeat, I won't go
back to Relax the Ba

08:52.661 --> 08:54.805
as long as Douglas works there,
and we both know Douglas

08:54.930 --> 08:56.995
is going to work there
for the rest of his life.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.642
All right, Roger.

08:58.767 --> 09:00.832
Let's do it.

09:03.605 --> 09:05.499
Roger should have been back by now.

09:05.624 --> 09:07.551
How long does it take to maim a kid?

09:07.676 --> 09:09.019
Mission accomplished.

09:09.144 --> 09:10.954
I did him Tonya Harding style.

09:11.079 --> 09:12.272
With a...
and a...

09:12.397 --> 09:13.574
and a...

09:15.183 --> 09:17.211
Somebody beat up Snot!

09:17.336 --> 09:19.225
Uh, aren't you Snot?

09:19.391 --> 09:20.852
I'm Barry.

09:21.018 --> 09:23.396
Stan, I might have got the wrong one.

09:25.460 --> 09:28.071
Why? Why?

09:28.196 --> 09:30.507
Why ask why?

09:30.632 --> 09:32.409
Try Bud Dry.

09:32.534 --> 09:34.144
That's an old reference.

09:34.269 --> 09:37.327
Not as old as the Nancy Kerrigan
thing you're doing.

09:42.394 --> 09:43.620
Hey, watch it with that thing.

09:43.745 --> 09:45.789
You're the one
who put me in this chair.

09:45.914 --> 09:48.366
I crippled your legs,
not your manners.

09:50.285 --> 09:51.328
Where's my lucky butterball?

09:51.453 --> 09:52.592
He's up next.

09:53.689 --> 09:54.731
I don't know.

09:54.856 --> 09:56.266
He should be here.

09:56.391 --> 09:59.060
Gee, I hope he makes it on time.

10:03.365 --> 10:06.009
Dad, I got a good feeling
about this one.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.171
Aah! He's so nimble!

10:20.816 --> 10:22.192
That was my longest match ever.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.761
Did you see how I
eluded his hand-feet?

10:24.886 --> 10:27.822
Can I pick out one toy
at Toys "R" Us?

10:29.658 --> 10:30.767
Well?

10:30.892 --> 10:31.902
This time, I got him.

10:32.027 --> 10:33.070
Trust me.

10:33.195 --> 10:35.138
Hey, ref, I don't know
where my guy is.

10:35.263 --> 10:36.553
I guess he'll have to forfeit.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.429
Fire! Fire!

10:38.595 --> 10:40.835
Stop! Drop! Roll!

10:44.101 --> 10:45.249
Damn it!

10:45.374 --> 10:47.417
Now he's one win away
from breaking my record.

10:47.542 --> 10:49.803
Sorry, Stan. I locked
him in the freezer.

10:49.928 --> 10:52.569
I don't know how the kid
set himself on fire.

10:57.235 --> 10:58.512
Small bills are in the safe.

10:58.637 --> 10:59.913
The rest is in my butt.

11:00.038 --> 11:01.548
I'm not here to rob you.

11:01.673 --> 11:04.163
I'm here to shoot a kid
in a tree house.

11:04.393 --> 11:06.103
You know what kid I wanted to kill?

11:06.228 --> 11:07.471
The youngest daughter
in <i>Mrs. Doubtfire.</i>

11:07.596 --> 11:08.739
Hated her face.

11:08.864 --> 11:10.791
By the time I could
get a good shot at her,

11:10.916 --> 11:12.797
she had grown up
and turned into nothing.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.761
Barry's only one win away.

11:14.886 --> 11:16.363
I will not lose my record!

11:16.488 --> 11:17.655
Well, killing him should do it.

11:22.544 --> 11:23.954
I can't get a clean shot.

11:24.079 --> 11:25.789
That damn oak tree is in the way.

11:25.914 --> 11:26.853
On it!

11:42.097 --> 11:44.174
I never knew you had
such powerful legs.

11:44.299 --> 11:46.476
Really? Really?

11:46.601 --> 11:48.211
You didn't know I had powerful legs?

11:48.336 --> 11:50.514
You never stared at my legs before?

11:50.639 --> 11:51.615
Okay.

11:51.740 --> 11:53.171
Okay, I'll just play along.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.301
This is great!

11:54.426 --> 11:56.003
I can teach you how to wrestle.

11:56.128 --> 11:58.438
You can pose as a student
at a rival high school,

11:58.563 --> 12:00.053
defeat Barry and save my record.

12:00.298 --> 12:02.142
So let me understand
this wrestling thing.

12:02.267 --> 12:05.646
The goal is to lie on top of
another man, against his will,

12:05.771 --> 12:07.781
for three seconds, in a bathing suit.

12:07.906 --> 12:10.417
Is this a high school sport
or my trip to Cancun?

12:12.227 --> 12:14.067
I'm sor... no, I'm-I'm in.

12:16.735 --> 12:17.791
Next match.

12:17.916 --> 12:20.365
Barry Robinson and Dimitri...

12:20.656 --> 12:21.728
Krotchlikmioff.

12:21.853 --> 12:23.897
Dimitri Krotchlikmioff.

12:24.022 --> 12:26.257
New exchange student from Russia.

12:36.880 --> 12:37.799
One, two...

12:37.965 --> 12:38.758
Use your legs!

12:39.020 --> 12:40.718
I can't!
I have really weak legs.

12:40.884 --> 12:42.095
No, you don't, you have the opposite.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.554
I know, today's opposite day.

12:43.775 --> 12:45.223
No, it's not!
That means it is.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.058
I'm not playing!
That means you are.

12:47.224 --> 12:50.073
Roger, just win before
the ref stops politely waiting

12:50.198 --> 12:52.188
for our conversation to end
and gets to three.

12:52.354 --> 12:53.564
Fine.

12:55.987 --> 12:56.830
One, two, three!

12:56.955 --> 12:57.860
Winner!

12:58.026 --> 12:58.903
Yes!

13:00.362 --> 13:02.052
Yeah!

13:02.177 --> 13:03.887
I win! I win!

13:04.012 --> 13:06.690
Uh, Coach Smith, that's the guy
from the other team.

13:06.815 --> 13:08.246
Shut up, corned beef!

13:08.412 --> 13:10.668
I can feel your pulse in my thigh.

13:16.842 --> 13:18.201
Uh-uh, Francine.

13:18.326 --> 13:20.804
Allow me to take my dishes
to near the sink for you.

13:20.929 --> 13:22.789
Well, okay, mister.

13:22.914 --> 13:26.226
You've been a pleasure
since Barry lost his match.

13:26.351 --> 13:28.099
Oh, are my muscles sore.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.230
Tired muscles?
What, you been working out?

13:30.355 --> 13:31.615
No, I've been wrestling.

13:31.740 --> 13:33.717
Already won 15 matches in a row.

13:33.842 --> 13:35.152
I'm going after the state record.

13:35.277 --> 13:36.286
You're still wrestling?

13:36.411 --> 13:37.775
Why the hell would you do that?!

13:38.046 --> 13:40.023
Excellent question.
Here's my answer.

13:40.148 --> 13:42.225
I don't want to work
as a docent my whole life,

13:42.350 --> 13:45.575
unless I'm a docent in a museum
dedicated to me.

13:45.741 --> 13:46.797
Roger!

13:46.922 --> 13:48.665
I'm gonna beat your record, Stan,

13:48.790 --> 13:51.164
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

13:53.895 --> 13:56.606
500 on Jimmy Cooper
to go down in the egg toss.

13:56.731 --> 13:58.275
Boy's got shaky hands.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.811
His parents just got divorced
because his mom banged

14:00.936 --> 14:04.548
some black dude named
this big mamma-jamma right here!

14:04.673 --> 14:07.451
That Russian kid from Lanceton
is gonna beat my record.

14:07.576 --> 14:10.141
I have to stop him.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.672
You have to let me
back into high school so I can

14:12.797 --> 14:14.520
wrestle against Krotchlikmioff
and keep my record!

14:14.686 --> 14:16.843
I'll do it on one condition.

14:16.968 --> 14:18.779
You buy some candy bars from me

14:18.904 --> 14:21.027
so that I stay off drugs
and don't join gangs.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.007
All right!

14:24.893 --> 14:26.436
I'm gonna keep my record!

14:28.597 --> 14:30.240
I can walk again!

14:30.365 --> 14:31.875
I can walk!

14:36.291 --> 14:40.484
You know, we always carry it
this way and bad things happen.

14:40.609 --> 14:42.319
Why don't we carry it this way?

14:42.444 --> 14:43.620
That's so smart.

14:43.745 --> 14:45.468
