WEBVTT

00:09.599 --> 00:12.352
That's all the time we have, Seattle.

00:12.644 --> 00:17.160
This is Dr Frasier Crane wishing you
good afternoon and good mental health.

00:18.608 --> 00:21.076
If I ask your opinion about something,

00:21.361 --> 00:23.477
will you give me an honest answer?

00:23.739 --> 00:28.051
Absolutely, Roz. Any time.
All you have to do is ask.

00:32.289 --> 00:34.928
- I knew it.
- No, I'm just kidding. I love it.

00:35.208 --> 00:36.527
It looks great.

00:36.752 --> 00:38.822
- Are you sure?
- Trust me.

00:39.087 --> 00:41.681
It's just in my condition
I'm a little insecure.

00:41.965 --> 00:44.604
Every time
I see something cute in the window,

00:44.885 --> 00:47.035
I remember how I look
and I think no way.

00:48.263 --> 00:51.460
- Here we go again.
- That's my cousin.

00:51.767 --> 00:55.237
- Nikos, what are you doing here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.

00:55.562 --> 00:57.553
It's great to see you.
It's been ages.

00:57.814 --> 00:59.930
Meet my producer Roz Doyle.

01:00.192 --> 01:02.786
This is Nikos,
my father's brother's son.

01:03.070 --> 01:05.300
I would've never pegged you for a Crane.

01:05.572 --> 01:10.123
- He gets his looks from his mom.
- Bet he gets looks from lots of women.

01:11.620 --> 01:14.771
- It's nice to meet you.
- I never knew Frasier had a cousin.

01:15.082 --> 01:18.916
He's ashamed of me. Why else would
he turn down my wedding invitation?

01:19.252 --> 01:21.846
- You're getting married?
- Yeah, on Saturday.

01:22.130 --> 01:24.883
- You didn't get the invitation.
- No.

01:25.175 --> 01:28.804
I knew Mom was lying when she said
she never heard back from you.

01:29.137 --> 01:31.697
She must still be nursing that grudge.

01:31.974 --> 01:34.363
This sounds like private family stuff.

01:34.643 --> 01:37.715
So, what's this grudge
you're talking about?

01:38.021 --> 01:42.094
Mom has never forgiven Frasier
for some career advice he gave me.

01:42.442 --> 01:45.593
And, trust me, he saved me
from going down the wrong path.

01:45.904 --> 01:49.817
Thank you, Nikos.
I certainly hate to miss this wedding.

01:50.158 --> 01:53.070
I wonder if there's some way
we could work this out.

01:53.370 --> 01:56.089
- So, what was the wrong path?
- It's a long story.

01:56.373 --> 01:58.807
My folks wanted me
to go to medical school.

01:59.084 --> 02:01.279
- What did you choose?
- We don't have...

02:01.545 --> 02:04.503
I became a juggler.

02:04.798 --> 02:06.789
I perform on street corners.

02:07.050 --> 02:10.758
I see.
And all because of his advice.

02:11.096 --> 02:14.611
- Do people sometimes toss you coins?
- Sure. Lots of times.

02:14.933 --> 02:17.447
Well, here's something
you can catch them in.

02:23.442 --> 02:25.433
It's all your fault.

02:25.694 --> 02:29.733
I have to monitor your blood pressure
and I'd like an accurate reading.

02:30.073 --> 02:33.543
- Why don't we try to solve this?
- She's a vindictive woman

02:33.869 --> 02:35.985
and she'll keep punishing us.

02:36.246 --> 02:40.524
If you'd kept your big trap shut my
nephew would probably be a surgeon now

02:40.876 --> 02:43.026
and I'd be going to his wedding.

02:43.295 --> 02:47.846
240 over 11.
That sounds about right.

02:48.216 --> 02:51.526
I'd loved to have gone,
but this is clearly a snub

02:51.845 --> 02:53.995
and we Crane men have our pride.

02:54.264 --> 02:56.824
You're just afraid
of seeing Cousin Yvonne.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.692
Who's Cousin Yvonne?

02:58.935 --> 03:01.495
A distant cousin
who has a slight crush on Niles.

03:01.772 --> 03:05.367
A slight crush. There are cannibals
who are less man-hungry.

03:05.692 --> 03:08.843
It would be romantic
to have a secret admirer.

03:09.154 --> 03:12.271
Someone who longed for me that much.
But I do see your point.

03:12.574 --> 03:16.283
When you think about it,
it is kind of sick.

03:16.620 --> 03:19.817
Perhaps sick is a tad judgemental.

03:20.123 --> 03:23.957
Because of your big mouth Zora
won't even let me in her restaurant.

03:24.294 --> 03:26.285
Forcing you to go elsewhere

03:26.546 --> 03:30.221
when you have a craving for stuffed
grape leaves and zither music.

03:30.550 --> 03:35.260
It's a moot point. We're not invited,
thanks to Frasier's inept advice.

03:35.639 --> 03:38.711
Can you imagine
living in the same city as your brother

03:39.017 --> 03:42.646
- and not see him for five years?
- No, but I'd like to give it a try.

03:45.649 --> 03:48.117
Dad, I think
we should go to this wedding.

03:48.402 --> 03:51.519
- Zora doesn't want us there.
- But Nikos wants us there.

03:51.822 --> 03:54.461
I watched him grow up.
I want to see him get married.

03:54.741 --> 03:58.654
I'd like to venture an opinion here.
I know this doesn't concern me,

03:58.996 --> 04:03.592
but I feel very strongly about this.
I like zither music and I always have.

04:07.879 --> 04:10.234
And we're back. Listen, Dad...

04:10.507 --> 04:14.182
Drop it, Frasier.
If my brother's wife doesn't see fit

04:14.511 --> 04:17.901
to send me an invitation,
I am not just going to show up.

04:18.223 --> 04:21.851
End of story. Case closed.
That's all she wrote.

04:22.185 --> 04:25.302
There are more important issues
at stake here

04:25.605 --> 04:28.995
than you being mauled
by Yvonne the Terrible.

04:29.318 --> 04:31.548
Dad is hurt. Can't you see that?

04:32.154 --> 04:37.274
He misses his brother. This is my fault,
and I'm going to put it right.

04:37.659 --> 04:42.096
I'm going to get in touch with Aunt
Zora. Surely she'll listen to reason.

04:44.958 --> 04:46.471
Aunt Zora.

04:48.462 --> 04:52.137
Well, that's encouraging.
She remembered my voice.

04:53.884 --> 04:55.681
Frasier, just give up.

04:55.927 --> 05:00.000
No. She can't avoid me
if I go to that restaurant.

05:00.349 --> 05:03.546
- Do you have a death wish?
- I'm not afraid of her.

05:03.852 --> 05:08.721
Have you forgotten that when Hitler
invaded Greece, she joined the partisans

05:09.107 --> 05:12.861
- so she could strangle Nazis?
- I have never believed that.

05:13.195 --> 05:15.390
She would have been five at the time.

05:15.656 --> 05:19.331
That's why the legend says
they were strangled with jump ropes.

05:21.000 --> 05:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:31.171 --> 05:34.368
Dimitri, pick up your order.
Don't make me hurt you again.

05:43.433 --> 05:48.029
Aunt Zora, I realise I'm not the most
welcome person here but...

05:50.273 --> 05:53.788
It is not fair to take my mistake
out on your husband or my father.

05:54.111 --> 05:56.989
- They didn't do anything.
- More pepper.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.510
You have a wedding.
You should be joyous.

05:59.783 --> 06:01.774
Sponge off this countertop.

06:02.035 --> 06:06.074
Nikos says his fiancÃ©e's a lovely
woman and you like her very much.

06:06.415 --> 06:08.975
You should be full of motherly emotions.

06:09.251 --> 06:13.324
When I find out who bent this skewer,
I'm ramming it right in his eye.

06:13.672 --> 06:18.621
I've always wanted to do this,
make a trip around the Greek islands.

06:25.225 --> 06:26.704
Aunt Zora,

06:26.935 --> 06:30.245
my point is that we are family.

06:30.564 --> 06:33.032
And we should be together.

06:33.317 --> 06:36.434
And I promise if you invite us
to this wedding, I will...

06:36.737 --> 06:40.412
never give Nikos another piece of advice
for as long as I live.

06:40.741 --> 06:45.417
I'm through meddling. You have my word.
And if you do invite us to the wedding,

06:45.787 --> 06:51.384
I'll promote this wonderful restaurant
of yours on my radio programme.

06:52.419 --> 06:53.977
Every day.

06:54.212 --> 06:56.442
For a... month.

06:57.382 --> 06:58.940
Frasier.

07:01.053 --> 07:03.692
- You forgive me.
- Of course.

07:03.972 --> 07:07.408
And you come
to the rehearsal dinner, too.

07:07.726 --> 07:09.762
Tomorrow night, right here.

07:10.020 --> 07:14.571
Here, eat, my very special <i>kokoretsi</i>

07:14.941 --> 07:17.375
for a very special nephew.

07:17.653 --> 07:21.441
I'm such a softy.
I'll be crying in a minute.

07:21.782 --> 07:23.773
Me, too.

07:36.421 --> 07:39.970
I hope you enjoy yourself,
Mr "Blessed Are The Peacemakers".

07:40.300 --> 07:43.098
Stop complaining.
The rehearsal went beautifully.

07:43.387 --> 07:45.378
Cousin Yvonne didn't get near you.

07:45.639 --> 07:48.597
How could she?
I hid in the confessional.

07:48.892 --> 07:51.964
By the way,
Mrs Pappas is having an affair.

07:52.270 --> 07:54.500
Here they are. My two favourite nephews.

07:58.193 --> 08:00.388
Ed, get me with the boys.

08:02.322 --> 08:05.200
I am so glad you are coming
to the wedding tomorrow.

08:05.492 --> 08:09.167
There is nothing sadder
than a divided family. Am I right?

08:09.496 --> 08:13.694
When Frasier said we weren't
invited I remember thinking...

08:14.042 --> 08:16.761
- There you are, Niles.
- Just kill me now.

08:18.755 --> 08:21.986
- Hello, Yvonne.
- I haven't seen you two in a long time.

08:22.301 --> 08:27.011
I haven't seen your two in a long time.
You too. Your... You too.

08:27.389 --> 08:30.938
We've got a lot of catching up to do.
Let's go get us a glass of bubbly.

08:31.268 --> 08:35.466
- I don't think...
- It's none of that sissy French wine.

08:35.813 --> 08:39.648
- It's real Greek champagne.
- Save some for me, Niles.

08:41.403 --> 08:46.272
And here he is,
my favourite brother-in-law, Marty.

08:47.326 --> 08:50.523
- It's been too long.
- It sure has. Say, where's Walt?

08:50.829 --> 08:54.299
- We've got a lot of catching up to do.
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

08:54.624 --> 08:56.979
Who is this pretty young thing?

08:57.252 --> 09:00.767
This is Daphne Moon,
my physical therapist.

09:01.089 --> 09:04.604
That's what they call it these days.
You dirty old man.

09:07.179 --> 09:09.374
This is my fiancÃ©e, Mary Ann Taubeneck.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.997
Mary Ann. It's a pleasure.
Taubeneck, as in the Taubeneck Building?

09:14.353 --> 09:17.550
Yeah, and Taubeneck Park,
etcetera, etcetera.

09:17.856 --> 09:20.893
That was my grandfather,
the original robber baron.

09:21.193 --> 09:25.311
- Mary Ann has issues with her family.
- Look at them sulking over there.

09:25.656 --> 09:29.649
You should've seen them when I told them
I was marrying a street person.

09:29.993 --> 09:32.632
- Street performer.
- Right.

09:33.330 --> 09:36.367
They've got it coming
after all the debutante nonsense

09:36.667 --> 09:39.579
they put me through.
Would you excuse me?

09:41.922 --> 09:45.801
- She's great, isn't she?
- Yes. How did you two meet?

09:46.134 --> 09:49.365
I performed at one
of her parents' garden parties.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.877
They were snooty to me.
That sparked something in her.

09:53.183 --> 09:57.335
She asked me for a date. She likes
to play with her parents' heads.

09:57.688 --> 10:01.158
Yes, well, so did Lizzie Borden.

10:01.483 --> 10:03.474
What do you mean?

10:03.735 --> 10:08.331
I can't help thinking that...
Nothing. Just a bad joke.

10:08.699 --> 10:12.374
- She seems like a lovely girl.
- Yeah, she is. My family adores her.

10:12.703 --> 10:16.855
My mom thinks Crystal's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

10:17.207 --> 10:20.836
- Crystal?
- Did I say that? I meant Mary Ann.

10:21.169 --> 10:25.481
I must have been admiring that crystal.
That's why I called her Crystal.

10:25.841 --> 10:29.117
It's a good thing
you weren't admiring the pork butt.

10:29.469 --> 10:31.903
I'm so nervous
I don't know what I'm saying.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.250
I guess it's pre-wedding jitters.

10:34.516 --> 10:38.953
Nikos, go check on the sous-chef,
make sure he isn't into the ouzo.

10:39.313 --> 10:42.749
Last time he drank on duty he got
his head caught in the duck press.

10:43.066 --> 10:45.785
- How did he manage that?
- With my help.

10:47.529 --> 10:51.363
So, what were
you and Nikos talking about?

10:51.700 --> 10:55.375
Don't you worry. I made you
a promise and I'd die before I break it.

10:55.704 --> 10:59.253
Or soon after.
So, you met Mary Ann?

10:59.583 --> 11:01.574
Yes. You must be very proud.

11:01.835 --> 11:05.305
And relieved. That son of mine
was going steady with a juggler.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.223
Crystal somebody.

11:07.466 --> 11:10.981
Imagine having a daughter-in-law
who throws things for a living.

11:11.303 --> 11:13.453
It's embarrassing.

11:14.973 --> 11:17.646
Come, people. Let's celebrate tonight.

11:20.729 --> 11:23.163
Thanks for settling everything
with Zora.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.759
It's my pleasure.

11:24.983 --> 11:28.339
I can't find Walt.
I've been waiting five years for this.

11:28.654 --> 11:32.124
Did you know Nikos and Mary Ann
have only known each...

11:32.449 --> 11:35.600
- There he is!
- You must have so much to talk about.

11:35.911 --> 11:38.106
- Uncle Walt, hello.
- Frasier.

11:43.126 --> 11:45.640
- Marty.
- Walt.

11:46.838 --> 11:49.671
- What's new?
- Same old, same old.

11:52.219 --> 11:55.370
- How's tricks?
- Can't complain.

11:56.431 --> 11:59.628
- They keeping you busy?
- You better believe it.

12:00.435 --> 12:05.065
- What are you gonna do?
- Tell me about it.

12:05.440 --> 12:09.319
It's amazing how you two
can pick up right where you left off.

12:26.670 --> 12:28.422
Put those back.

12:29.298 --> 12:31.937
Niles, do you realise
how pathetic this is?

12:32.217 --> 12:35.448
At dinner Zora announced
that I'd filed for divorce.

12:35.762 --> 12:40.358
Within seconds Yvonne began purring
so loudly my allergies kicked in.

12:40.726 --> 12:43.035
I won't be safe
till this wedding is over.

12:43.312 --> 12:46.224
A wedding I think
might be a serious mistake.

12:46.523 --> 12:48.593
Does this mean you're going to meddle

12:48.859 --> 12:52.613
- and get us both thrown out?
- I can't. I promised I wouldn't.

12:52.946 --> 12:55.506
- Here she comes again.
- Have you seen Niles?

12:55.782 --> 12:57.056
No, I haven't.

12:57.659 --> 13:00.127
- Here we go.
- How much longer do we have to stay?

13:00.412 --> 13:03.290
- What are you in a snit about?
- Thanks to Zora,

13:03.582 --> 13:06.654
they're sniggering about
me being your physical therapist.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.394
She's always been a pain.

13:09.671 --> 13:12.981
You're telling me.
Dried up old grape leaf.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.768
And she's one to talk
about reputations, too.

13:16.053 --> 13:18.089
Before she married my brother,

13:18.347 --> 13:21.259
she was easier to make
than a peanut butter sandwich.

13:23.310 --> 13:25.301
Does everyone know that?

13:25.562 --> 13:28.440
Everybody except my brother.
I love him dearly,

13:28.732 --> 13:33.044
but he's not exactly the brightest bulb
in the...

13:33.403 --> 13:35.997
- Bulb box?
- Yeah.

13:36.281 --> 13:39.318
Here's Eddie.
Hey, Eddie. Where's the camera?

13:39.618 --> 13:41.609
Then it worked. It's right here.

13:45.290 --> 13:50.045
I decided to go undercover. I wanted
to get people just being themselves.

13:50.420 --> 13:55.414
We were really boring. Why
don't you rewind it and tape over it?

13:55.801 --> 13:59.430
Funny. Mrs Pappas said the same thing.

13:59.763 --> 14:02.402
So why did you and Crystal break up?

14:02.683 --> 14:05.959
I'm not meddling. I'm just curious.
Just interested.

14:06.269 --> 14:08.829
It was a career conflict.
She's a juggler, too.

14:09.106 --> 14:12.178
You may have heard of her.
Crystal Baker?

14:12.484 --> 14:17.683
No, I don't get to street theatre
as often as I should.

14:18.073 --> 14:21.622
Fabulous performer.
Fabulous girl, for that matter.

14:21.952 --> 14:24.864
But she wanted to work in Paris
and I wanted to stay here.

14:25.163 --> 14:27.882
There's always pressure
on a two-career family.

14:28.166 --> 14:31.238
We had a big fight about it.
Then Mary Ann came along.

14:31.545 --> 14:35.424
By the time Crystal got back,
I was engaged.

14:35.757 --> 14:39.716
- And how did she take the news?
- She was crushed.

14:40.053 --> 14:43.443
But she's been wonderful.
She called me to congratulate me.

14:43.765 --> 14:47.963
We talked for hours,
just like old times. She's a sweetheart.

14:48.312 --> 14:50.303
She's starting to sound like one.

14:50.564 --> 14:56.275
It was really great talking with her.
I felt happy, purely happy.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.050
It might be the last time I did.

14:59.323 --> 15:02.872
Since then it's been the usual
pre-wedding stuff. The jitters,

15:03.201 --> 15:05.192
night sweats, vomiting...

15:07.414 --> 15:11.248
I promised your mother I would
never again interfere in your life.

15:11.585 --> 15:14.657
Interfere? You saved me
from making a terrible mistake.

15:14.963 --> 15:18.353
I value your advice above anything.

15:20.260 --> 15:23.457
All right. In the interest
of your future happiness,

15:23.764 --> 15:25.755
it's my duty to let you know...

15:26.016 --> 15:31.044
Nikos, please go make your Uncle Stavros
to stop dancing on the table.

15:31.438 --> 15:34.236
It would be nice
to have a family gathering

15:34.524 --> 15:38.119
where no one leaves in an ambulance.
Am I right?

15:41.031 --> 15:43.147
Yes, wouldn't it?

15:47.746 --> 15:51.136
Eddie, come on, you've been working
ever since I've been here.

15:51.458 --> 15:55.736
- You haven't had chance to chow down.
- I wouldn't mind grabbing a bite.

15:56.088 --> 16:00.161
- Hand me that thing then.
- Be careful. That tape is historic.

16:00.509 --> 16:02.943
I've interviewed
every member of the family.

16:03.220 --> 16:06.735
I even taped Nikos' great-grandmother.

16:07.057 --> 16:09.890
- 101 years old.
- That's amazing.

16:13.188 --> 16:16.783
101. Gosh, that's older than a century.

16:17.109 --> 16:20.658
She probably has got more stories
than anybody else has.

16:21.947 --> 16:25.701
- I can't do this.
- Press this button right here.

16:26.034 --> 16:27.023
Thanks.

16:29.371 --> 16:30.360
Bye.

16:32.624 --> 16:36.902
OK, everybody, gather round.
We're going to have some toasts here.

16:37.254 --> 16:40.769
So if everybody will stop
for one minute and...

16:41.091 --> 16:43.810
Why don't you
just hide in the men's room?

16:44.094 --> 16:46.449
Where do you think Yvonne is right now?

16:47.764 --> 16:49.117
Where have you been?

16:49.349 --> 16:52.625
I've been trying
to contact Nikos' ex-girlfriend.

16:52.936 --> 16:55.325
The depths you'll sink to to get a date.

16:56.690 --> 17:00.524
I am convinced that he is still
in love with her. And she with him.

17:00.861 --> 17:03.659
If I could get them together
he might realise it in time.

17:03.947 --> 17:08.384
Alas, I couldn't reach her. Had
to leave a message with her roommate.

17:08.743 --> 17:10.939
Perhaps the time has come for you to...

17:14.415 --> 17:17.135
...stop playing games
and start being direct.

17:17.419 --> 17:20.411
Frasier? Where's Frasier Crane?

17:20.797 --> 17:22.867
Oh, dear God.

17:23.133 --> 17:28.605
There you are. Come up here
and make a toast to the happy couple.

17:29.014 --> 17:32.086
I guess a thought or two comes to mind.

17:35.479 --> 17:38.596
I've known Nikos

17:40.275 --> 17:43.984
all of his life
and I'm sure that he realises

17:44.321 --> 17:48.030
marriage is a binding commitment,
not to be entered into hastily.

17:48.367 --> 17:52.280
But when the right one comes along,
you know it.

17:52.621 --> 17:58.173
And it's very important to find the
person that you're most compatible with.

17:59.378 --> 18:04.247
The one who makes you feel
"happy, purely happy".

18:04.633 --> 18:07.943
More important, makes me feel happy.

18:08.261 --> 18:12.698
It would be a shame to go through life
having to say, "lf I'd only waited".

18:13.058 --> 18:15.652
What the hell
kind of toast is this anyway?

18:17.270 --> 18:21.741
I want to make sure that my cousin
marries the woman he truly loves.

18:22.109 --> 18:25.146
Well said. Cheers, everybody.

18:26.154 --> 18:27.303
Thank you, Frasier.

18:27.531 --> 18:32.366
If I may say a word or two. My son Nikos
and I have had our ups and downs.

18:32.744 --> 18:35.656
But tonight at this moment
I can honestly say...

18:35.956 --> 18:39.153
What the hell are you doing here?

18:39.459 --> 18:40.778
Crystal.

18:41.003 --> 18:41.992
Nikos.

18:44.298 --> 18:48.894
I couldn't let you get married
without letting you know that I...

18:58.687 --> 19:01.599
Nikos, what're you doing? Stop it.

19:01.898 --> 19:04.651
Her roommate
must have called her car phone.

19:04.943 --> 19:06.934
Jugglers have car phones?

19:08.488 --> 19:12.163
Nikos, you are ruining everything.
You, shoo, shoo, shoo.

19:18.623 --> 19:19.612
Nikos.

19:21.376 --> 19:24.573
Sorry, but Crystal's
the one I'm meant to be with.

19:24.880 --> 19:30.193
I will never forgive you for this.
See how happy you've made my parents?

19:34.264 --> 19:37.301
Frasier, he's lost his mind.
Talk to him.

19:37.601 --> 19:39.796
Remember my promise?
No more meddling.

19:40.062 --> 19:43.099
Excuse me, everyone.
This may not be appropriate,

19:43.398 --> 19:47.027
but I have a toast too, to the man
who reunited me with the woman

19:47.361 --> 19:50.353
- I plan to spend my life with.
- No, no, inappropriate.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.966
- Toast time is over.
- We want to offer you our thanks.

19:54.284 --> 19:57.879
You know what? Later on
why don't we do some bouzouki dancing?

20:03.627 --> 20:05.618
Why are they thanking you?

20:06.713 --> 20:08.749
We owe our happiness to him.

20:09.424 --> 20:11.733
Why couldn't she have been a mime?

20:14.054 --> 20:17.330
Once again he saved me
from making a terrible mistake.

20:17.641 --> 20:21.395
So, everyone, please lift your glasses
to my cousin, Frasier Crane.

20:21.728 --> 20:24.162
I can do better than a glass.

20:24.439 --> 20:27.158
No! Aunt Zora! Out of my way!

20:30.821 --> 20:32.254
Well, Walt...

20:32.489 --> 20:33.478
Marty...

20:35.117 --> 20:36.789
Goodbye again.
