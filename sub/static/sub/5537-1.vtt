00:46.922 --> 00:50.176
MAN: I watch my 16-month-old son,
and he's fearless,

00:50.300 --> 00:54.146
and he wants to just walk out
into the shore break.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.105
I mean, there's something
so interesting about that,

00:59.226 --> 01:02.196
to watch him just stare at the ocean,
stare at waves coming in,

01:02.312 --> 01:06.533
and watch them just crash on the shore,
and that's super entertaining.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.700
So much of it is just, you know,
you put your feet in the water,

01:14.825 --> 01:19.126
and you feel your toes sink
into the sand, and to feel that draw,

01:19.246 --> 01:23.467
the pull of the tides
and the surge of the shore break...

01:23.584 --> 01:25.586
You know, and you want to go out deeper.

01:42.603 --> 01:46.858
MAN 2: You could live for three months
on 100 bucks.

01:46.982 --> 01:49.110
We didn't think of it
as any kind of a culture.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.613
We just thought of it as like,
"Aren't we lucky to be doing this?"

01:59.244 --> 02:01.417
MAN 3: There was less than 15 chairlifts
in the world,

02:01.580 --> 02:04.675
and I bought my first pair of skis
for two dollars.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.768
MAN 4: We were kind of disenfranchised
from society.

02:14.885 --> 02:18.389
I mean, we had totally different
lifestyles than our parents.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.356
MAN 5: It was obvious
that this was going to go someplace,

02:26.521 --> 02:30.401
but, man, we were like broke hippies.

02:35.322 --> 02:39.043
MAN 6: We were kind of on the low rung
of the totem pole.

02:39.201 --> 02:44.549
You were kind of an outlaw,
kind of an outcast.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.085
And there was no future in that.

03:28.542 --> 03:35.266
MAN 7: You're 100% focused on what
you're doing right now, this instant.

03:35.424 --> 03:39.270
This instant is the most
important thing in all of your life.

03:41.596 --> 03:45.942
The past is the past, and the future...
Well, who knows what's coming?

03:46.059 --> 03:48.278
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

05:29.830 --> 05:34.427
MAN 4: Somehow, every time you do it,
at whatever level,

05:34.543 --> 05:37.968
I mean, whether it's your first day

05:38.088 --> 05:40.887
or you've been doing it
your whole life...

05:41.883 --> 05:47.515
It somehow manages to free you
from a lot of the things in life

05:47.639 --> 05:51.485
that are going to try and sink you,
try and drag you down,

05:51.601 --> 05:56.653
that are going to try and make you
unhappy or negative.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.785
It somehow allows you
to leave all that behind

06:00.902 --> 06:06.784
for maybe just a moment,
but sometimes that moment's enough.

06:12.372 --> 06:16.718
MAN 3: It's a basic instinct of a human
being, his search for freedom.

06:16.835 --> 06:22.558
And still the search for freedom
is within all of us.

06:25.010 --> 06:28.514
MCKNIGHT: Whether you're young or old,
male or female, it's the same thing.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.766
It's that thrill of the first ride,

06:30.891 --> 06:34.612
and once it gets under your skin,
you can never stop.

06:37.188 --> 06:42.160
We would all be in prison. I think.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.080
If you're kind of a misfit kid
and you want to rebel,

06:45.196 --> 06:47.290
you need a place to do that
in a positive way.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.417
Some guys grab skateboards and did it.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.663
Other guys grabbed climbing ropes
and came up here.

06:55.999 --> 06:59.469
My number-one goal
was to cover the Earth with bikes.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.430
You know, it's going to happen.
This is going to happen.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.766
There's no doubt.
It's just a matter of time.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.063
To me, being in the wilderness
is what it's all about.

07:17.187 --> 07:21.363
Wilderness is the battery
that recharges all of your energy.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.902
Gives us life, gives us inspiration.

07:24.027 --> 07:29.204
You're touching it. You're feeling it.
You're a part of the cliff.

07:30.200 --> 07:36.628
You understand the power of this thing
that you're interacting with.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.843
I think what motivated me
when I was young

07:43.964 --> 07:47.138
and what motivates me now
are basically the same things.

07:47.258 --> 07:51.559
That sense of glide,
and that sense of weightlessness.

07:51.680 --> 07:54.274
There's a host of sports now
that didn't used to exist,

07:54.391 --> 07:56.268
and they all have that same sensation

07:56.393 --> 08:00.023
that is sort of core
to a lot of people's nature.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.863
Adventure, to me,

08:04.985 --> 08:08.910
is just getting out of your comfort zone
and going into the unknown.

08:09.030 --> 08:17.165
That's where I feel every emotion
of life and feel the most alive.

08:25.422 --> 08:29.052
Most sports are a form of art.
It's no different than an artist

08:29.175 --> 08:32.054
having a big piece of canvas
and a paintbrush.

08:32.178 --> 08:36.399
Having a skateboard and going out
in the city is a similar thing.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.027
Skateboarding happens
to be one of those sports

08:39.144 --> 08:42.239
that allows you to push pretty far
into a creative place.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.164
Well, I just wanted to see what it felt
like to be fifth gear, pinned,

08:58.288 --> 09:00.336
and just sail in the air
as long as I could.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.210
It just seemed like such a great idea.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.148
When I started surfing,
there were maybe, you know,

09:24.272 --> 09:27.867
not more than a thousand or two surfers
in the world, for sure.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.237
So we felt very, very elite

09:30.361 --> 09:35.162
because we knew about this thing
that the mainstream had no idea existed.

09:37.077 --> 09:41.423
Surfing was the antithesis of organized
social behavior when it began.

09:42.874 --> 09:45.593
See all those guys in their cars
leaving for their nine-to-five?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.633
Who's got it right, them or us?

09:48.505 --> 09:52.726
And that was the question.
That was the question.

10:05.897 --> 10:12.872
A bum is somebody who won't work,
and I've never worked, so that fits.

10:14.072 --> 10:18.498
If you love what you're doing,
it isn't work. It's fun.

10:18.660 --> 10:22.290
I made my first movie in '49, '50.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.917
I did all the photography,
all the editing, stole the music,

10:26.042 --> 10:30.343
booked the shows, got the ski clubs
to put it on, designed the posters.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.468
I showed up on time, set up
the projector, set up the screen,

10:34.634 --> 10:37.183
set up the microphone and the PA system,

10:37.303 --> 10:40.022
and narrated the show live.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.687
110 cities in one year.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.875
I made movies of people skiing.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.298
Now, of course they said,
"Who is going to watch that?"

11:09.419 --> 11:12.673
They were right in a lot of cases,
because there was many times,

11:12.797 --> 11:14.265
I can't tell you how many,

11:14.382 --> 11:18.478
where I showed up in a high school
auditorium, 1,000 seats, 1200 seats,

11:18.595 --> 11:21.269
and there'd be eight or ten people there
and that was all.

11:21.431 --> 11:24.230
But those eight or ten people,
I really screwed up their lives,

11:24.350 --> 11:28.071
because at least two or three of them
took up skiing.

12:47.141 --> 12:50.190
We all tried to figure out
something we could do

12:50.311 --> 12:53.315
that we could stay at the beach
and live how we wanted to live.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.945
I mean, obviously, like,
a surfer would rather live

12:58.069 --> 13:01.164
in an expand-o trailer
on a perfect point break

13:01.281 --> 13:03.124
than have a mansion in Beverly Hills

13:03.241 --> 13:05.790
with 45 servants and eight Rolls Royces.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.914
I mean, it's just
where your priorities are.

13:10.206 --> 13:14.882
At the time, if you go, "I'm a surfer,"
they go, "Oh, God, poor guy."

13:15.003 --> 13:18.974
The high school I went to had 3,000
kids, and I was the only surfer.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.809
- INTERVIEWER: And where was that?
- That was in Long Beach.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.474
PEZMAN: In 1959,
the movie "Gidget" came out,

13:27.640 --> 13:33.318
and surfing went from just a small
amount of surfers, trace amount,

13:33.438 --> 13:36.487
to several million by '63.

13:36.607 --> 13:41.864
The Endless Summer came out in 1964,
'65, and opened in Kansas City.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.706
And there were guys driving cars around

13:43.865 --> 13:46.744
with surfboards sticking out the trunk
that had never seen the ocean.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.129
BROWN: "Endless Summer"
showed the rest of the world

13:57.253 --> 13:58.550
what surfing was really like,

13:58.671 --> 14:01.766
and it was correct
for the people that were in it.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.972
It entertained a general audience

14:04.135 --> 14:06.604
who didn't know
anything about the sport.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.723
It's just a home movie.
You just shoot it,

14:08.890 --> 14:12.645
and then when you get home,
you look at the footage and edit it.

14:12.769 --> 14:14.237
But that's what I'd always done.

14:14.354 --> 14:21.329
We shot, edited, narrated,
not because I thought I was good at it.

14:21.444 --> 14:25.574
It was the only one I could afford
that would work for 50 cents an hour.

14:27.116 --> 14:30.711
PEZMAN: Every time a new movie would
come out, you'd go to the opening,

14:30.870 --> 14:33.749
and it was a gathering of the clan.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.759
What the surfers found in them
that was so compelling

14:36.876 --> 14:39.755
was what other good surfers looked
like, what they were doing.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.765
So they were the basic form
of communication.

14:42.924 --> 14:46.269
And the surf magazines came along
in the early '60s,

14:46.386 --> 14:48.730
and it was the beginning
of the lifestyle culture.

14:48.930 --> 14:51.353
It was the first time
they'd had a language

14:51.474 --> 14:56.401
and a dress code and behavior
that left where you did it

14:56.521 --> 14:58.944
and was taken to school,
or wherever you went.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.784
And then the funny thing
about surfing is,

15:01.901 --> 15:03.619
is that it spawned skateboarding.

15:03.736 --> 15:07.661
And then skateboarding urbanized
and came back and influenced surfing.

15:07.782 --> 15:11.912
So there's all kinds
of cultural cross-pollination.

15:12.912 --> 15:16.166
The clothing industry caught hold
in the early '70s,

15:16.290 --> 15:18.839
and this thing went ballistic.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.799
MCKNIGHT: If you were to ask me back
then if we were going to have

15:24.966 --> 15:28.846
the largest surf-skate-snow
industry company ever,

15:29.011 --> 15:33.016
I'd tell you, no, not a chance, no way.

15:35.059 --> 15:38.233
It's really not about any one person,
never has been.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.608
I always call myself just a humble
board short maker so here we are.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.951
INTERVIEWER:
Let's talk a little bit about you.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.661
(LAUGHS) OK.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.950
I lived in a little house in Newport.
We had no money.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.918
I had a Volkswagen van. That was
our biggest asset in the company.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.380
At least we could drive around
and make things happen.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.670
I had no business being in business.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.881
I had no idea how to start something.

16:01.043 --> 16:04.422
I thought my business experience would
be to just go to work for somebody

16:04.547 --> 16:06.015
and get a paycheck and learn.

16:06.174 --> 16:09.599
So we really had to make it up
as we went along,

16:09.719 --> 16:13.519
just driving around town all day long
finding fabric, Velcro, snaps.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.519
We'd get about 24 pairs
out of production every day.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.361
I'd put the snaps in every pair.

16:19.479 --> 16:23.985
And we'd put them in my Volkswagen van,
and drive to an account

16:24.108 --> 16:26.031
who would take
as many as we could supply.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.576
I thought,
"All right, well, this sounds fun."

16:29.697 --> 16:33.497
I can hang out at the beach.
I can keep surfing.

16:33.618 --> 16:36.588
I have this little project,
do it for a year or two,

16:36.704 --> 16:39.207
and then I'm going to go
to graduate school. That was my plan.

16:54.263 --> 16:57.688
MAN: You know, when I was young,
climbing saved our lives.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.357
We had nothing to do
with corporate America.

17:00.478 --> 17:04.073
I mean, this is the '60s.
We just said no to a lot of that stuff.

17:04.190 --> 17:08.319
We had a counterculture lifestyle
and made our own way.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.367
We really were proud of the fact

17:10.488 --> 17:13.583
that climbing had
no economic value in society.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.701
That was great.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.446
When we were doing big walls
in Yosemite and stuff,

17:47.567 --> 17:50.992
hardly anything had been done.
So you didn't repeat routes.

17:51.153 --> 17:54.327
I mean, why repeat a route
when you can go do a new route?

17:58.244 --> 18:00.463
KAUK: I think the curious common bond
that we all had

18:00.580 --> 18:04.551
is a passion to do something
with no outside motivation.

18:04.667 --> 18:05.964
It was more from the inside.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.801
Because you weren't going
to get famous about it.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.425
You weren't going to get paid for it,
no way, no how.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.938
When you first started
coming into this place,

18:18.097 --> 18:20.850
it was really intriguing about
the lifestyle and the characters.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.818
It just seemed
like an array of characters.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.983
You've got to remember,
it was in the early '70s.

18:25.146 --> 18:28.491
There was a whole revolution of things
going on in mainstream society

18:28.608 --> 18:33.364
of protesting wars, you know,
hippie generation and all that.

18:33.487 --> 18:35.785
It seemed like everything
was an adventure around here.

18:35.906 --> 18:39.456
Every step you were taking
had an inspiration of the unknown

18:39.577 --> 18:41.579
and the excitement just to be here.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.809
If you go back
in the history of bicycles,

18:55.926 --> 18:59.430
over 100 years ago,
people rode nothing but unpaved roads.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.522
So one could say,

19:00.640 --> 19:04.895
"Well, off-road riding,
that started when bicycles started,"

19:05.019 --> 19:07.397
which now everybody takes for granted.

19:07.563 --> 19:12.535
But back in the '60s, '70s,
it was a radical proposition.

19:16.530 --> 19:20.080
There was this whole place
where people would go to, this shrine,

19:20.242 --> 19:24.497
where it was so close
to a major crazy city, San Francisco,

19:24.622 --> 19:29.469
yet at the same time
you could get so far away.

19:29.585 --> 19:33.886
The golden key was this thing
called a balloon tire bike,

19:34.006 --> 19:37.260
and originally it was, you know,
found objects.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.855
It was bikes that were found
in second-hand stores

19:40.971 --> 19:44.521
and, you know, the Goodwill or dumps.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.025
What happened here was
a mongrelized bike.

19:49.230 --> 19:52.279
I mean, some people,
half the people would spit on it

19:52.441 --> 19:54.990
and say, "This is a piece of junk.
Are you out of your mind?"

19:55.111 --> 20:00.242
And the other half would say, "That's
what I want! I need that thing."

20:07.123 --> 20:08.215
MAN: I was lucky enough

20:08.332 --> 20:11.757
to have met a couple of the first
windsurfers in Hawaii in 1974.

20:11.877 --> 20:16.348
I wasn't big enough or strong enough
to get the sail out of the water.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.763
I was 11 years old,
weighed, like, 72lbs.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.308
I graduated from high school in 1981,

20:25.433 --> 20:28.152
and that's the year
the sport turned pro.

20:28.269 --> 20:30.692
So I deferred admissions to university.

20:30.813 --> 20:33.612
I said, OK, I'll see what being
a pro windsurfer might be,

20:33.733 --> 20:35.485
because there weren't any at that point.

20:38.279 --> 20:41.078
MAN: When you first started skating,
especially in the '80s,

20:41.240 --> 20:45.711
or even the '70s,
skaters were outcasts. It wasn't cool.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.502
When I was in high school,
I got ridiculed for skating.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.632
There were only
two other skaters in my school.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.423
We just kept our head down, did our work

20:52.543 --> 20:54.341
and bolted as soon as the bell rang.

21:03.679 --> 21:10.483
JONES: I got into it in its early
days from before we had bindings,

21:10.644 --> 21:12.988
before it was allowed at ski resorts.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.857
The vibe in the early days was like,

21:14.982 --> 21:16.655
"You can never make a living
doing that."

21:16.776 --> 21:21.122
There was no such thing as a snowboard
industry or a pro snowboarder.

21:37.171 --> 21:40.641
(WIND HOWLING)

21:50.893 --> 21:53.567
I left school and the whole thing.

21:53.687 --> 21:59.114
Left at 16 to come up here.
I did not feel like I was smart.

21:59.235 --> 22:02.079
That was some of the side effects
of being in a situation

22:02.196 --> 22:06.167
where you're being given
an A, B, C, D, or F.

22:08.369 --> 22:13.921
And you convince yourself that you're
not as good as, you're less than.

22:14.041 --> 22:17.966
But at the same time, I realized
something very curious for myself,

22:18.087 --> 22:20.840
that I had a very strong connection
to nature.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.687
Basically, rock climbing
became a way of life.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.274
Now, who would have thought?

23:13.267 --> 23:14.234
I was a youth.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.942
What I recognize is you're willing
to almost do anything

23:17.062 --> 23:19.030
to just know who you are
and where you're at.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.491
And with youthful enthusiasm,

23:20.608 --> 23:22.906
they're willing to try it
just for the adventure of it,

23:23.027 --> 23:25.405
for the initiation
into something that...

23:25.529 --> 23:28.282
Who knows what it is?
It might be a gang. I don't know.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.506
And I tell them that you had to do
something to get in here,

23:40.628 --> 23:42.050
even to get locked up.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.593
Now you know where you're at.
What are you going to do about it?

23:50.679 --> 23:53.603
What I got to experience as a kid
on a 20-day backpacking trip,

23:53.724 --> 23:55.692
hiking to the top of peaks and things,

23:55.809 --> 24:00.440
is that somehow your imagination
will catch something,

24:00.606 --> 24:05.032
and you might get that miracle of life
that is "anything's possible."

24:18.958 --> 24:20.551
All right, gentlemen.

24:20.668 --> 24:22.670
- MAN: Have fun.
- MAN 2: Good luck riding!

24:22.795 --> 24:25.594
JONES: I fell in love with
skateboarding and surfing early on.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.467
Just getting to the beach
was a huge adventure.

24:28.592 --> 24:33.598
Oftentimes, it was hitchhike
45 minutes away, hide in the bushes,

24:33.722 --> 24:35.770
sleep on the beach
so you're there in the morning.

24:35.891 --> 24:40.362
I was seeking out
the optimal places to surf and skate,

24:40.521 --> 24:45.743
and had those adventurous ethos
from the beginning.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.620
Going into these places,

24:55.786 --> 24:58.414
you fill your backpack with everything
you think you might need,

24:58.580 --> 25:01.880
and you walk into the wilderness.

25:03.127 --> 25:07.428
And to go out there and really walk
through these mountains,

25:07.589 --> 25:10.593
one wrong call
could have dire consequences.

25:10.718 --> 25:14.689
It's super important
to be really present-moment.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.739
And it is a process
getting into the flow,

25:28.861 --> 25:30.955
to, like, really, really
get into the flow.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.700
I'm really firing on all cylinders,

25:34.825 --> 25:40.707
and reading, like, every little nuance
that the mountains are doing.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.879
And when I come back
from time in the mountains,

25:47.004 --> 25:52.261
whether it's a day or a week
or a month, I respect life,

25:52.384 --> 25:55.888
but I feel like
it's really important to live life.

26:32.382 --> 26:38.640
Every day, I'm involved in a pathway
that's a critical pathway.

26:38.764 --> 26:43.611
Someone's life depends on the decisions
and the actions that I take.

26:46.980 --> 26:50.826
And I saw myself
on a predetermined pathway.

26:50.943 --> 26:54.914
There is a medicine career pathway.

26:55.030 --> 27:00.412
And when I was taken
into the wilderness for the first time,

27:00.536 --> 27:04.336
that disrupted my pathway.
It disrupted my life.

27:04.456 --> 27:08.632
It was a liberating circumstance
that just happened

27:08.752 --> 27:16.261
to explode my comfortable life
into a million little pieces.

27:18.178 --> 27:22.684
The wilderness opened up
a whole new possibility for me.

27:22.850 --> 27:25.649
It alerted me to the fact that there was

27:25.769 --> 27:32.323
another, deeper, more multidimensional
person inside this doctor.

27:37.531 --> 27:40.660
I get inspired by an idea

27:40.784 --> 27:44.209
and the challenge, the excitement for me

27:44.329 --> 27:49.381
is to make the idea,
the vision, a reality.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.969
I wanted to jump off, base jump,

27:55.132 --> 27:57.430
the highest cliff in the world,
the great Trango Tower.

28:07.019 --> 28:13.117
For me, all adventure is a metaphor
for the journey inside yourself,

28:13.233 --> 28:19.912
getting to know the darkest, remotest
corners of your own psyche.

28:21.575 --> 28:25.205
Sometimes that means going way,
way, way outside your comfort zone.

28:27.247 --> 28:33.550
So I started to pursue fear,
the mastery of fear.

28:40.802 --> 28:42.349
MAN:
The thing that I've looked at,

28:42.471 --> 28:46.351
which is on a poster my sister gave
to me when I was a young kid,

28:46.475 --> 28:49.228
was a picture of a really big wave,
and there was a surfer on there.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.271
It said, "Face your fears,
live your dreams."

28:51.438 --> 28:56.069
That sat above my bed
from my early teens till I left home.

29:01.198 --> 29:04.372
That inspired me to work
the last 20 years of my life.

29:04.493 --> 29:07.667
Almost killed myself,
but facing my fears.

29:07.829 --> 29:14.508
My fears were fears of acceptance,
you know, and being worthy.

29:16.004 --> 29:21.056
I was someone that was always pushed
to "100% is all that's acceptable."

29:31.645 --> 29:34.524
Having that drive
to always push for the top,

29:34.648 --> 29:38.403
it's driven me to want
to jump further than anyone else.

29:42.698 --> 29:45.497
As a child I was the one in the block

29:45.659 --> 29:48.503
where the parents didn't want
their kids to hang out with me

29:48.620 --> 29:49.667
because I was crazy.

29:49.871 --> 29:53.091
But one thing I liked doing
was riding motorbikes.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.803
I was four years old
when I got my first motorcycle.

29:58.046 --> 30:01.095
And that became the next ten years.
We just traveled the circuit.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.968
We were doing all the state rounds,

30:03.093 --> 30:05.346
and eventually
the national championships.

30:09.266 --> 30:13.316
My dream has always been to jump
big jumps on my motorcycle.

30:14.563 --> 30:20.161
I've always looked to the top of
the pyramid as, like, that's the goal.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.198
I went to Evel Knievel's funeral.

30:24.323 --> 30:27.918
It was something that I just really
wanted to go to and pay my respects

30:28.035 --> 30:31.630
because I really felt
that we had some kind of tie.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.000
I stood in line to go up
and just kind of say a prayer

30:34.124 --> 30:37.219
and stood in front of him,
and, you know, kind of bowed my head.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.555
I just said, "Evel,
I want to follow in your footsteps

30:39.671 --> 30:42.675
and take the torch where you've left
it, and take it to a greater height

30:42.841 --> 30:44.718
and I want to do that
with your blessing."

30:44.885 --> 30:47.934
And when I said that,
there was this crazy rush of cold air.

30:48.055 --> 30:51.150
I can feel my hair on my whole body
standing up right now.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.485
It's like I feel like
I got the Knievel spirit in me.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.651
It's just like
I felt like he gave me his blessing.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.421
MAN: When we all got out of school,
it was like our skate gang.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.791
There was no age discrimination

31:15.957 --> 31:18.176
other than what my brother tried
to put on me.

31:18.293 --> 31:21.547
It was always an uphill battle to get
his approval for me to be around.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.807
Then I would also have
to impress his friends

31:24.966 --> 31:29.392
for them to also, you know, to stand me,
to be OK to be in the crew.

31:30.472 --> 31:33.100
So that drove me
to push myself quite a bit.

31:34.684 --> 31:37.904
When I was a kid, I used to sit
in class and draw ramps all the time,

31:38.021 --> 31:40.991
and I always had this vision
that ramps could be a lot bigger.

31:41.108 --> 31:43.236
You know, why were they
the size they were?

31:43.360 --> 31:46.739
I would sit there and brainstorm
new ideas of things I could do

31:46.905 --> 31:49.454
when I got out of school
on the ramp that day.

31:49.574 --> 31:52.544
When I think of a trick,
when I'm sitting at my house,

31:52.661 --> 31:54.129
I come down here and learn it.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.419
A lot of what I'm doing today,

31:56.540 --> 31:59.760
I fantasized about it
as a kid quite often.

32:02.379 --> 32:06.850
I was a bit of a daredevil as a kid.
Combine that with the creativity,

32:07.008 --> 32:09.852
and that's really the formula
of what makes me tick.

32:15.851 --> 32:18.400
WOMAN: When I started snowboarding,
I quit everything for it,

32:18.520 --> 32:20.272
and it was the only thing
I thought about.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.866
I was gonna move to Whistler,
be a professional snowboarder.

32:23.024 --> 32:26.244
Every decision I made was for that goal.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.489
I don't think I had that feeling
with anything else.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.583
So there was no B plan.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.294
There was no, "If it doesn't work out,
what's going to happen?"

32:34.411 --> 32:36.539
That was just the plan,
and it was going to work out.

33:03.523 --> 33:07.403
I don't know how to say it.
It's like I'm almost breathing.

33:08.403 --> 33:13.876
Like the best breath you can take
of full bliss and happiness.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.787
It's like magic.

33:23.001 --> 33:27.848
I do tow-in surfing, kite surfing.

33:28.006 --> 33:33.433
Surfing, stand-up surfing
and wind surfing.

33:56.660 --> 34:02.087
NAISH: I've been riding with Kai Lenny
since he was nine years old

34:02.249 --> 34:06.220
and helping him through
the whole process of becoming a pro,

34:06.378 --> 34:09.973
and now being, basically,
the best in the world at stand-up,

34:10.130 --> 34:12.634
you know, an incredible windsurfer,
kiter, surfer.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.887
He's kind of like me,
where he does everything.

34:15.053 --> 34:18.648
LENNY: You know, Robby, since
I was young, would always tell me,

34:18.806 --> 34:20.525
you're a product of your environment.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.896
I always knew what I wanted to do,
what I wanted to be.

34:54.134 --> 34:57.729
Looking at Robby for inspiration,
he's old enough to be my dad

34:57.846 --> 35:01.100
and he's still going,
stronger than ever.

35:01.224 --> 35:05.229
And he sometimes... I sometimes
feel like he's younger than me.

35:40.180 --> 35:41.523
NAISH: Most people grow up.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.893
You get out of high school
and they stop playing.

35:44.017 --> 35:47.772
They lose that aspect of falling down
and getting back up

35:47.896 --> 35:51.275
and brushing yourself off
and doing it again as an adult.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.902
And I've never lost that.

35:54.027 --> 35:58.203
I'm still doing the same thing
that I was when I was 12 or 16 or 20.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.870
I think it's good for you.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.390
FISHER: I like riding bikes.
Man, I like riding bikes.

36:15.507 --> 36:18.556
I was the thorough addict.
I was a road racer.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.554
And when I was 12 years old,

36:20.679 --> 36:25.025
I told myself, "I will never stop
doing this, no matter what."

36:29.938 --> 36:31.906
I wanted to spread this thing everywhere

36:32.023 --> 36:37.530
because I knew that we could just make
a lot of people so happy.

36:38.655 --> 36:44.003
The first year, we made 160 bikes.
The second year, we made 1,000 bikes.

36:44.119 --> 36:46.338
People lined up out the door.

36:47.997 --> 36:53.504
In 1983, for the first time in history,
you could walk into a bike shop

36:53.628 --> 36:56.757
and walk out with this fat-tired thing
called a mountain bike.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.602
In another ten years,
when someone would say "bike,"

37:01.720 --> 37:04.519
they'd actually mean a mountain bike.

37:04.681 --> 37:07.901
(EXHILARATING MUSIC)

38:14.209 --> 38:16.803
(CHILDREN CHATTERING)

38:26.554 --> 38:27.931
MAN: You go to this amazing park,

38:28.097 --> 38:31.692
there are two gigantic,
awesome artificial turf soccer fields.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.610
There's a gigantic, beautiful dirt
and grass baseball field.

38:35.730 --> 38:38.483
There's basketball courts.
There's a full swimming facility.

38:38.608 --> 38:40.110
Then there's a gigantic skate park.

38:40.235 --> 38:43.114
I think that says a lot
about the evolution of everything.

38:43.238 --> 38:46.993
In this kind of community, all those
sports are kind of at the same level.

38:47.992 --> 38:50.211
Skating is such an important part
of this community.

38:50.370 --> 38:53.419
So many kids are doing it,
we have to include that in our park.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.263
HAWK: Action sports
have become mainstream

39:08.429 --> 39:11.524
because as soon as we step
on a skateboard, on a surfboard,

39:11.641 --> 39:15.862
a motorcycle, a bike, it's on.

39:51.139 --> 39:55.064
SEMIAO: I noticed that contemporary
youth adored and respected

39:55.184 --> 39:59.030
and revered these pro athletes,
pro skateboarders,

39:59.147 --> 40:03.118
in the same manner that they felt
about mainstream athletes.

40:03.234 --> 40:06.283
Whether it be a Michael Jordan
or a Tiger Woods.

40:07.864 --> 40:11.664
JONES: You now have,
at least at a competitive level,

40:11.784 --> 40:14.003
a ton of parallels
to these traditional...

40:14.120 --> 40:17.169
Whether it's soccer, football,
you name it.

40:17.290 --> 40:18.837
Today we watch the Olympics,

40:18.958 --> 40:24.431
and the number-one rated event at
the Olympics is halfpipe snowboarding.

40:24.547 --> 40:27.892
I don't think anyone thought
it would grow to that size.

40:29.636 --> 40:31.354
CAMPBELL: Now you have the first,

40:31.512 --> 40:33.731
or probably second by now,
generation of people

40:33.848 --> 40:36.852
whose expectations are
"I want to be a pro athlete."

40:38.019 --> 40:40.818
Ladies and gentlemen, you've just seen
some magnificent surfing

40:40.939 --> 40:43.783
out here in the Pacific Ocean
and Santa Clara River Mouth.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.902
Here with me I have Kelly Slater.

40:47.362 --> 40:50.536
MCKNIGHT: Kelly comes along.
He's this beautiful little kid from Florida.

40:50.657 --> 40:53.752
We met him when he was...
I don't know, 15 or 16 years old.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.791
Walked up to us
at the trade show and says,

40:55.912 --> 40:58.085
"I'm going to be the best surfer
in the world one day."

40:58.247 --> 40:59.749
And we just looked at him. "Really?"

40:59.874 --> 41:03.174
Then other people told us that this is
the guy, and we're like, "OK."

41:18.851 --> 41:21.855
I think he stands head and shoulders
above anybody else.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.779
He was the guy that took it
from a core activity

41:24.899 --> 41:27.402
to a mainstream consciousness.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.332
Probably by the time
I was about ten or 12,

41:32.490 --> 41:36.211
I was pretty sure I'd be a pro surfer.
That's what I wanted to be.

41:36.327 --> 41:38.625
You know, I didn't know how,

41:38.746 --> 41:41.545
or if it was going to make a living
for me or anything like that,

41:41.666 --> 41:43.794
but I knew that was what I wanted to do.

41:51.009 --> 41:52.101
I woke up this morning

41:52.218 --> 41:55.392
and realized I had this long dream
about a barrel all night.

41:55.596 --> 41:57.143
And it's just... it's my passion.

41:57.265 --> 42:01.190
I don't know if there's anything
I would have been as passionate about.

42:15.825 --> 42:18.920
ANNOUNCER: 11-time World Champion
paddling in. He's up.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.961
There he goes, Kelly Slater in the pipe.

42:22.081 --> 42:24.459
Riding in the barrel, can he come out?

42:26.586 --> 42:29.055
(CHEERING)

42:34.886 --> 42:36.729
SLATER:
It's basically a desire, you know?

42:36.846 --> 42:40.350
Having a passion for it
and having the desire to keep learning.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.950
No matter how much you think you know,

42:50.068 --> 42:53.322
there's a lot more that you don't know
than you do know,

42:53.446 --> 42:56.165
and if you keep that idea in your head,

42:56.282 --> 43:00.037
if you perceive surfing that way,
then you're always going to have fun.

43:00.161 --> 43:02.163
You're always going to keep
learning things.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.219
I mean, you look
at the young generation of kids

43:09.337 --> 43:13.092
and they're surfing a lot better
than we were at that age.

43:17.011 --> 43:20.641
With video and film, they could sit
there on a rainy day when it's flat

43:20.765 --> 43:22.688
and literally watch surfing all day.

43:22.809 --> 43:25.904
By watching something,
it's learning by example, you know.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.239
You're getting taught visually.

44:46.934 --> 44:49.232
MAN: As far as, like, videos,
that is so important.

44:49.353 --> 44:55.235
I think just as important, if not more
important as winning any contest.

44:55.359 --> 44:59.330
That's really where the progression
of skateboarding gets pushed to.

45:01.032 --> 45:04.411
HAWK: People, they devote years
to making a video part.

45:04.535 --> 45:05.752
That's how important it is.

45:05.870 --> 45:09.170
All their efforts of skateboarding,
as a pro skater,

45:09.290 --> 45:12.590
if they're not competing, are going
to making an amazing video part,

45:12.752 --> 45:15.005
and breaking themselves off
in the process.

45:24.513 --> 45:28.188
HUSTON: That's what kids ask,
"How do you do this trick every try?"

45:28.309 --> 45:32.109
I go out there and I do it
every single day for this many years.

45:32.230 --> 45:35.109
You're eventually going to be able
to do it almost every single try.

45:35.233 --> 45:37.076
And, I mean, obviously it takes failing.

45:37.193 --> 45:41.118
It takes falling a lot to be able
to get to that point, you know,

45:41.239 --> 45:44.413
falling a lot, and falling hard,
and getting hurt, and all those things.

45:44.533 --> 45:46.752
But that's just part of the game.

45:48.412 --> 45:49.789
(GROANING)

46:01.259 --> 46:03.603
Yes! Finally.

46:05.346 --> 46:08.225
We're definitely
in the age of the sports vid.

46:08.349 --> 46:12.479
And, er, I think it's changed
the sports big time.

46:12.603 --> 46:15.277
If you look at the films,
they are the history books.

46:15.398 --> 46:18.493
They do show you
what the progression is.

46:18.609 --> 46:24.616
The most important part of documenting
these sports are watching the films.

47:57.083 --> 48:01.429
MAN: What we've seen happen
probably in the last ten years

48:01.587 --> 48:04.966
is what we're living in right now,
the digital revolution.

48:05.091 --> 48:07.890
You never know you're inside
a revolution when you're living in it.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.728
Now, if you look back,

48:09.929 --> 48:14.184
it'll be like we're living
in the Wild West of the Internet.

48:14.308 --> 48:17.562
Cameras are shrinking
and getting better every day.

48:29.532 --> 48:31.580
CAMPBELL: The reason
those shots are so amazing

48:31.700 --> 48:36.547
is because it truly puts you
in the perspective of the athlete.

48:36.664 --> 48:41.386
It just became the staple of how people
shared their sport adventures.

49:20.416 --> 49:23.215
When everything
got blown apart by the Internet,

49:23.335 --> 49:28.387
everybody started doing their web clips
and stuff, it became very different.

49:28.507 --> 49:31.306
It was more like the experience
of out on the road and traveling.

49:31.427 --> 49:34.727
The riding wasn't
the most intense or the craziest,

49:34.847 --> 49:39.068
but it was accessibility, and it was
about something anyone could do.

49:58.287 --> 50:00.210
GIRL: It started when I was, like...

50:00.331 --> 50:03.961
The summer of, like, sixth grade
going into seventh grade.

50:04.084 --> 50:07.714
I wanted to surf every day that summer
to get better.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.091
Once the summer was over,
there was only 30 days left.

50:10.216 --> 50:12.810
I'm like, "OK, well, I'll make
it 100 days," and so I did 100 days.

50:13.010 --> 50:18.858
Then I decided, like, a year,
and then it was two years,

50:19.016 --> 50:22.737
and now I just did 1,000 days,
so I want to do three years now.

50:28.609 --> 50:30.236
Even if it's bad, I still have fun.

50:30.361 --> 50:35.458
Surfing just makes me so happy,
so it's good. Every day is a good day.

51:13.654 --> 51:16.203
WOMAN: We were in the water,
growing up, every single day,

51:16.323 --> 51:17.745
all day long, as much as we could.

51:17.866 --> 51:19.709
My parents never really
forced us to surf.

51:19.827 --> 51:23.582
It was just like, "Here's the beach,
do whatever you want."

51:23.706 --> 51:26.175
Here's some surfboards, boogie boards,
some sand toys.

51:26.292 --> 51:28.260
Like, basically, just have fun.

51:28.377 --> 51:31.802
And that's kind of where it started,
just sandcastles on the beach.

51:43.767 --> 51:46.566
I think my limits are a little
different than other people's limits.

51:46.687 --> 51:50.237
Other people's limits are maybe surf
bigger waves, surf more often,

51:50.357 --> 51:52.200
or, you know, learn new tricks.

51:52.318 --> 51:56.789
I just like to keep surfing the way
I like it, and that's just to have fun.

52:00.242 --> 52:02.870
For me, I think
pushing myself in my sport

52:02.995 --> 52:05.464
is maybe more about teaching people,

52:05.623 --> 52:08.046
and showing people
this amazing thing that we do,

52:08.208 --> 52:10.051
and putting a smile on their face.

52:10.169 --> 52:14.720
That's pushing my sport for me,
I guess. That's what it means to me.

52:16.300 --> 52:18.473
I remember the first wave I ever caught.

52:18.594 --> 52:23.020
You know, still to this day,
if I could explain the feeling,

52:23.182 --> 52:25.981
it would be like
what it feels like for me now,

52:26.143 --> 52:28.316
dropping into a huge wave at Jaws.

52:37.196 --> 52:42.498
Basically, you instantly feel like
nothing else in the world exists.

52:42.618 --> 52:47.340
Nothing else matters.
You're living in the moment.

52:52.336 --> 52:54.088
Big waves are relative, you know.

52:54.254 --> 52:58.475
I think everyone's a big-wave surfer
if the waves seem big to you.

52:58.592 --> 53:01.061
You know, that's... It's all relative.

53:05.933 --> 53:09.528
BOY: You just want to feel it again,
and you want to keep driving,

53:09.645 --> 53:13.570
keep going just to keep feeling
the same emotion every time,

53:13.691 --> 53:15.318
every time you skate.

53:16.652 --> 53:18.120
It's fun.

53:18.278 --> 53:22.328
I mean, I keep saying that,
but it really is that fun.

53:22.449 --> 53:27.580
And it's... I just can't describe it.

53:29.873 --> 53:36.381
You just feel like you're in the groove,
and you're just going with it.

53:36.505 --> 53:37.722
It's the best.

54:29.767 --> 54:32.611
I really don't put that much thought
about what I really want to do.

54:32.728 --> 54:38.861
I'm just trying to skate and have fun
and keep progressing the sport.

54:38.984 --> 54:42.909
I don't really know what to do
right now, because I'm just kind of...

54:43.071 --> 54:45.574
It's kind of the off-season
I guess, right now.

54:45.699 --> 54:49.704
There's really no off-season.
Just kind of always skating.

54:54.541 --> 54:58.136
BOY: When you're a kid, you get asked
this one particular question a lot.

54:59.505 --> 55:01.678
It really gets kind of annoying.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.847
(APPLAUSE)

55:03.967 --> 55:06.971
"What do you want to be
when you grow up?"

55:07.095 --> 55:10.725
Now, adults are hoping for answers
like, "I want to be an astronaut."

55:10.849 --> 55:13.898
Or "I want to be a neurosurgeon."

55:14.019 --> 55:16.693
- You adults and your imaginations.
- (LAUGHTER)

55:16.814 --> 55:20.444
Kids, they're most likely to answer
with "pro skateboarder,"

55:20.609 --> 55:22.737
"surfer," or "Minecraft player."

55:22.861 --> 55:26.240
I asked my little brother, and he said,
"Seriously, dude? I'm ten."

55:26.406 --> 55:29.660
"I have no idea. Probably a pro skier.
Let's go get some ice cream."

55:29.785 --> 55:31.287
(LAUGHTER)

55:31.411 --> 55:34.836
See, us kids are going to answer
with something we're stoked on,

55:34.957 --> 55:38.461
what we think is cool,
what we have experience with.

55:38.585 --> 55:42.055
But if you ask a little kid,
sometimes you'll get the best answer,

55:42.172 --> 55:45.767
something so simple, so obvious,
and really profound.

55:47.344 --> 55:49.972
"When I grow up, I want to be happy."

55:58.647 --> 56:04.154
This is where I'm really happy.
Powder days. Skiing, to me, is freedom.

56:05.237 --> 56:08.207
I look at this
and see a thousand possibilities,

56:08.365 --> 56:10.993
and it's a good metaphor for my life.

56:20.419 --> 56:24.970
People are celebrating
just what action sports really entail,

56:25.090 --> 56:27.513
much more than just the technical side.

56:27.634 --> 56:31.480
It's just more about the opportunity
it gives you to be out on the mountains,

56:31.597 --> 56:34.441
be out in the oceans.
It's just an amazing experience.

56:42.024 --> 56:45.619
At the center of the whole industry,
there is still that core,

56:45.736 --> 56:48.285
that very limited,
very small group of people

56:48.447 --> 56:52.077
who really continue to push progression
and really take us to the next level.

56:52.200 --> 56:54.953
Because that's really,
at the end of the day,

56:55.078 --> 56:58.048
that's really where
a lot of the new ideas are born.

57:22.147 --> 57:24.525
MCCONKEY: You always kind of have
in the back of your mind

57:24.691 --> 57:28.070
what your biggest passions are,
and your biggest goals,

57:28.195 --> 57:29.447
and that's what you live for.

57:29.571 --> 57:33.997
And for people like me,
that's jumping off stuff,

57:34.117 --> 57:36.290
sliding down snow as fast as I can,

57:36.453 --> 57:40.174
finding interesting, creative ways
to have fun in the mountains.

57:46.838 --> 57:48.761
Skis, normally,
are the fattest at the tip

57:48.882 --> 57:50.475
and they get skinny under your foot,

57:50.592 --> 57:53.311
and then they get fat again at the tail,
and these are the opposite.

57:53.470 --> 57:56.269
They're fattest in the middle
and they get skinnier at the top.

57:56.390 --> 58:00.236
I took that shape idea
from water sports,

58:00.352 --> 58:02.980
from surfboards and from wake-boards
and from water skis.

58:04.231 --> 58:06.029
So finally I just decided, you know,

58:06.149 --> 58:09.494
I'd grab these water skis
and mount them up.

58:09.611 --> 58:11.989
These are jumping water skis
from the '70s.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.025
I put those things on,

58:44.146 --> 58:48.822
and then all of a sudden
these huge double doors just went...

58:49.860 --> 58:53.114
And I was like, "Look what we can
do now. Look what I can do!"

58:58.201 --> 59:01.831
HAWK: To be successful,
you've got to be learning new stuff.

59:01.955 --> 59:03.127
You've got to be inventing.

59:03.248 --> 59:08.550
You've got to be pushing the boundaries,
going bigger, flipping more,

59:08.670 --> 59:12.300
spinning more, going higher.
That's the way you make your mark.

59:24.895 --> 59:26.442
(CROWD CHEERS)

59:35.906 --> 59:41.083
I think that is solely what drives me,
the land of the infinite possibility,

59:41.244 --> 59:44.214
knowing if I go to work today, I can do
something I've never done before.

59:48.293 --> 59:52.514
Just like skateboarding as a sport,
when the physical aspect of it evolves,

59:52.714 --> 59:54.887
I believe that the environments
that we skate on

59:55.008 --> 59:58.308
also should evolve
with the skateboarding itself.

59:58.428 --> 01:00:01.307
The ultimate goal is to get to
where motocross and snowboarding's at,

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:04.355
as far as magnitude of jumps
and distance and heights,

01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:06.945
and the caliber and scale
of the air time.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:14.119
There's no boundary. There's no limit.
We haven't found it yet.

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:42.016
SCHARR: It's crazy because I'd always
watch the videos of Tony doing 900s.

01:00:42.139 --> 01:00:45.484
It only took just one person
to have the great idea

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.361
to try to take it up a notch each time.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:52.324
I guess I was that person on this one.
(CHUCKLES)

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:14.763
FISHER: Somebody asked me,
like, ten years ago,

01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:17.053
what's the biggest advance
in the mountain bike?

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.892
I said, "The trail."

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:23.560
That whole technique, artistry,

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:28.193
has seeped out and is
just starting to cover the Earth.

01:01:35.233 --> 01:01:39.454
The ultimate trail-building started out
of Vancouver and the B.C. area.

01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:40.914
The trail builders up there,

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:44.376
some of them have become
sort of like underground cult heroes.

01:02:44.302 --> 01:02:46.225
When I'm not working at the hospital,

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:54.481
I practice the same procedural basis
to go and do wingsuiting, climbing.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:59.284
I change the outfit of clothes
that I wear, I change the look,

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:04.282
but the underlying process,
I think, is very similar.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:18.175
There is a thrill-seeking gene,
the DRD4 gene on chromosome 11.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:21.515
You can have
between two and 11 copies of that gene.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.726
If you have two copies,
you're a low-sensation seeker.

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:29.144
If you have 11 copies,
you're a high-sensation seeker.

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:31.141
And that's me. That's Heather.

01:03:31.266 --> 01:03:35.988
We've done the tests.
We have 11 copies of the DRD4 gene.

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:43.408
It's a whole difference
in our essential brain neurochemistry.

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:48.625
A lot of the behaviors that we think
are environmentally determined,

01:03:48.742 --> 01:03:53.168
in fact, many of them have
a genetic predisposition.

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:59.219
SWAN: And I don't consider myself
to be an extreme sports person.

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:04.092
I consider myself to be
somebody who's experiencing things.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:35.498
SINGLEMAN: Skydiving, it started
as a way to save your ass

01:04:35.622 --> 01:04:38.341
when you got out of a plane
that was falling out of the sky.

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:43.130
And then it became a sport.

01:04:43.254 --> 01:04:47.885
People wanted to prolong the amount
of free-fall time that they had,

01:04:48.009 --> 01:04:50.808
so they started building suits
that gave them wings,

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:54.983
that prolonged the amount of time
that you could interact with the air,

01:04:55.141 --> 01:04:57.360
interact with that new environment.

01:04:57.477 --> 01:05:00.947
And that technology is getting better
and better all the time.

01:06:05.712 --> 01:06:09.967
That's a nice climb right there, too,
that little tiny thin crack.

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:14.474
It's funny how that works,
because in your youthful times,

01:06:14.596 --> 01:06:16.894
you play the risk, in a way.
It's more exciting.

01:06:17.056 --> 01:06:19.855
As you get past that, and you realize
that you don't live forever...

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:22.354
- When you're 19, you'll live forever.
- Yeah.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:26.029
But when you're my young age of 56,
you're like, "Dang, you don't."

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:34.909
BOY: I'm only 16,
but I've been through a lot of stuff.

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:40.331
Like, from 2011 to now,
I've been locked up probably, like...

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:45.668
Like 20 times.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:52.518
BOY 1: Since I'm 18 now, if I keep
continuing this path I walk on,

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:55.387
it's going to lead down
to destruction and all that.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:07:02.812
Time makes you think. It really does.
Just sitting in there, you think.

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:09.447
Yep. That's right.
It goes around that way.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:12.116
Underneath, and then back out.

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:17.417
KAUK: Don't even think about it.
Just start going, yeah.

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:21.129
Put your foot right inside that crack.
Yeah, like that. Exactly.

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.590
(LAUGHTER)

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:28.837
- Keep going. Motivation.
- Lift this one up, down.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:33.513
Yeah. Focus. Just use the rope a bit,
and go up there and grab it.

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:36.557
Pull up, and we'll pull you up.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:40.519
Got you, we got you.
Just jump. Yeah, bro. Yeah!

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.062
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:43.400
It's so interesting.

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:46.692
We call it, when we're underneath
a friend, you "spot" him.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:49.441
So that's what we're kind of doing
for each other now

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:50.692
in these moves we're making.

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:53.661
Those kids are sharing how they feel
and I'm sharing how I feel.

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:57.783
We're spotting each other in life,
helping each other to the next move.

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:02.496
- You're holding me.
- Yeah.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.463
My life's in your hands.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:28.564
CHOUINARD: Every definition
of adventure in "Webster's"

01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:30.689
has an element of risk.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.193
If you take the risk out,

01:08:33.318 --> 01:08:36.447
you take a lot of the values
that you get out of it.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:43.621
When you're doing these risk sports
you try to live right on the edge,

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:46.294
and try to push that envelope
all the time,

01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:48.166
push the edge away all the time.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:51.386
But you never go over,
because if you go over, you're dead.

01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:07.731
I know going into it
that there's a really good chance

01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:11.026
that, unless everything is perfect,
I'm going to pull the plug.

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:17.203
I start out the day going,
"There's 20 nos."

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:21.541
"Unless I turn those into yeses,
I'm bailing on this thing."

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:26.459
Sometimes that means I've made it
three quarters of the way up a mountain,

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:30.425
and I can't get that 20th "yes,"
and I'm pulling the plug.

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:39.885
If I can just leave this thing

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:43.809
that I've spent three weeks
trying everything I have into it,

01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:45.598
and I can walk away from it,

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:49.728
then that's when I know
I'm making the right decisions.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.571
I think the time
when you're most stressed

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:03.667
is when you do your most important work,
and that's how it's been for me.

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:05.831
I've overcome
some of the gnarliest injuries,

01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:08.000
broken backs, necks,
and punctured lungs,

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:11.250
and nearly ruptured my aorta.

01:10:11.374 --> 01:10:15.470
I've had over 40 broken bones
and none of them I'm proud of,

01:10:15.586 --> 01:10:17.088
but they've all taught me lessons,

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:19.390
and they've molded me
into the person I am today.

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:26.689
When you put your helmet on
and it comes down to the night,

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:30.902
you screw in the throttle and hope for
the best, but it's a calculated risk.

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:33.362
There's been a lot of planning
going in place.

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:45.784
In my biggest jumps, I've actually
sat there before and been...

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.410
it sounds crazy to say this,

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:49.921
but it's the daredevil nature,
being like, you know what?

01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:52.381
However this works out
is how it's meant to be,

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:55.251
and however it does go down,
I'm just going to embrace it.

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:57.845
If I'm falling from a ten-storey
building and it's the end,

01:10:58.004 --> 01:10:59.881
I'm just going to give into it
and just let it be,

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:03.551
and not scream on my way down.
You know, just... just take it.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:17.649
For the Arc de Triomphe,
the fear was definitely killing myself.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:20.744
Like, I was really worried
about not making it

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:22.737
and seeing the new year come in.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:27.120
Part of me wanted to just quit
there and then.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:31.004
But that childhood dream of mine
was that little echo going,

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.464
"You've got to do this
for that kid in you,

01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:35.754
the one that dreamed like that
all through school,

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:38.094
who wanted to do that.
How's the opportunity."

01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:40.213
"You going to walk out now? Coward?"

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:51.850
(DRAMATIC MUSIC)

01:11:57.605 --> 01:11:59.858
(CHEERING)

01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:05.909
You could feel it in everyone.
You could see people were nervous.

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:08.658
Everyone around me,
the whole team was, like, on edge.

01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:10.456
It was such a tense moment.

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:18.422
I worked out and faced my fears
in myself,

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:22.514
and I faced the fear of that jump
months before I even got there.

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:45.700
You're scared of hurting yourself,
of hucking off that ledge.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:50.917
You're scared of that giant wave
that's barreling down on you.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:53.832
Riding the edge of that fear

01:12:53.953 --> 01:13:00.336
and what is that fine line between
reckless abandon and calculated risk,

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:03.679
to where you're doing something,
you don't even think twice about it.

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:08.393
I just saw the snow under my feet
break up.

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:10.978
I knew right away what was happening.

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:15.896
Thankfully I was really calm that day,
and I was able to keep my speed

01:13:16.017 --> 01:13:19.146
and focus on what I needed
to do to get out of it.

01:13:26.277 --> 01:13:27.904
Learning to deal with fear

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:32.792
and talking yourself down from things
you're scared of really helps.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.913
It really helps you deal with other
situations for the rest of your life.

01:13:36.037 --> 01:13:39.883
Because then nothing becomes
that big of a deal,

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:43.424
since you've put yourself in
a situation where you were so scared.

01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:51.810
KAUK: You're always negotiating
with the fear of something

01:13:51.928 --> 01:13:53.430
to know how to protect yourself.

01:13:53.554 --> 01:13:56.603
If you feel the fear come in,
that's just a sign. "What are you doing?"

01:13:56.724 --> 01:13:58.852
And as a rock climber,
you go the other way, I think.

01:13:58.976 --> 01:14:00.444
When fear comes, you calm down

01:14:00.561 --> 01:14:02.814
and you think clearly,
"OK, what do I need to do?"

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.816
You don't panic and start shaking
and wing it

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.784
and start going for it
and see what happens.

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:11.782
So I think that fear is
a very interesting friend

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:15.669
that's there for you to help you,
protect you, make you consider.

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:37.849
SINGLEMAN: There's no words to describe
how scared I was on my first base jump.

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:44.698
Every animal on the planet has a fear
system that's basically the same.

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:46.612
It's there to protect you.

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:49.861
But what can happen
is it can get out of hand.

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:51.784
It can start firing off

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:55.499
when you're having thoughts about
doing the things that you want to do.

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:03.382
The fear of death
is the fear of the unknown.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:07.720
It's the fear that is probably
the strongest in all of us,

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:14.265
and to confront that and run off
a cliff into the unknown,

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:21.982
every cell in your body is on fire
screaming, "Don't do it."

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:31.028
When you know that you've undergone
the proper training

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:33.405
to get to the edge of this cliff,

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:38.077
then you use that understanding,
that reason and logic

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:43.081
to cut through
the screaming chatter and do it.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:06.029
We both went into a tumble
due to the thin air

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:11.242
and the heavy 16mm old
clunky cameras that we had.

01:16:11.358 --> 01:16:16.364
I hadn't expected that.
I thought I had pushed it too far.

01:17:15.047 --> 01:17:18.893
These sports used to be
real rebel, counter-society,

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:21.228
"don't go near them" sort of activities,

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:24.269
to now they're readily acceptable,

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:29.567
although the extreme part of it is
getting more and more extreme.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:24.167
These guys have a crazy switch,
and they can't wait to get there.

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:27.503
They live for it. So they're pushing it,
and by them pushing it,

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:30.089
the next group wants to go bigger
and higher,

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:32.959
and it's just been pushed
and pushed and pushed.

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:37.714
It's the inherent DNA of these
performers. They want to go big.

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:12.211
There's a point where, intuitively,
you really do hit the red line

01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:15.005
on where you're getting
to the point of taking serious risk,

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:19.255
and that is injury or death
or whatever it is.

01:19:19.380 --> 01:19:22.975
There's a point where that's reality.
There's a threshold there

01:19:23.092 --> 01:19:25.311
unless you're really ready
to go that far to risk,

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:28.772
and you can digest
the consequences, you know?

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:21.317
MADDISON: I could keep pushing myself
to be the best in the world,

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:24.241
but realistically it's not possible.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:29.124
I honestly feel like this lifestyle,
the motorcycle lifestyle,

01:20:29.241 --> 01:20:32.245
has taught me what I needed to know.

01:20:34.288 --> 01:20:36.757
I'm able to let go
of that wild daredevil side

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:39.509
that needs to prove to the world
that I can do the craziest things.

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:42.345
I really don't feel
I need to prove that any more.

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:56.477
The fears I've had to face,

01:20:56.602 --> 01:21:00.152
I've really had to kind of face myself
and find out who I am,

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:04.322
and the only way to do that is to sit
in a quiet room and sit it out.

01:21:06.070 --> 01:21:08.368
It's a hard thing to do.
I still struggle with it.

01:21:08.489 --> 01:21:11.459
But that's when I find the biggest joy.

01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:16.455
I had to do some crazy things
to find that.

01:21:37.267 --> 01:21:38.610
CAMPBELL: Since the beginning,

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:41.230
there's been monumental change
in action sports.

01:21:41.397 --> 01:21:43.900
At its core, the thing that remains
absolutely the same

01:21:44.024 --> 01:21:48.154
is that experience,
that calling that people have.

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:51.532
This is something
that I'm completely dedicated to,

01:21:51.698 --> 01:21:54.577
and it's who I am, and it's something
I'm going to do my entire life.

01:22:15.097 --> 01:22:18.601
CHOUINARD: You get to the summit.
There's no summit. It's just flat.

01:22:18.725 --> 01:22:21.148
There's nothing up there.
There's nobody meeting you.

01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:23.773
There's no wise man up there
telling you the secret of life.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.111
There's nothing.

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:28.611
You realize, you know what?
It's all about the process.

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:38.791
KAUK: It's a fine line
when you're forcing something

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:40.752
and you're learning to flow
with something.

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:42.500
You're becoming a part of something,

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:45.127
or you're just trying to grope
your way through something

01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:46.504
with just strength.

01:22:53.135 --> 01:22:55.229
There's a place I go to by myself a lot

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:57.435
where it's just a horizontal traverse,

01:22:57.556 --> 01:22:59.399
I just try to learn to move
with the moment

01:22:59.516 --> 01:23:00.688
and be focused on my breath.

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:03.437
I might go across the traverse
and just think about breathing.

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:08.193
I might go through it just thinking
about my hands, or my feet,

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:12.367
or, you know, how you're moving
your shoulders, whatever, and practice.

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.121
By going out and rock climbing,

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:23.089
you have to face everything
about yourself, and it's all up to you.

01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:25.426
You take your hands and feet,
you put them on the rock.

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:28.216
You pull yourself up.
You are 100% responsible for yourself.

01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:30.214
You've got to know
that knot's tied right.

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:33.388
You've got to know who your partner is.
You need the trust of a partner.

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:38.814
I bring that up to our youngsters.

01:23:38.931 --> 01:23:41.059
I say, "Rock climbing
is like what you guys do."

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:44.195
"if you get yourself into something,
how are you going to get out?"

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:50.868
I think for me, sometimes it's just
to see the potential in something

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.494
and try to bring it out.

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:05.101
MCKNIGHT: Trying to grab surfing
is like trying to hold a snowflake.

01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:08.525
You know, the minute you try to hold it
and possess it, it melts.

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:19.036
The wave is forming in front of you.
The wave is over your head.

01:25:19.239 --> 01:25:20.866
Your wake is disappearing.

01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:22.959
Your footprints are washed
from the beach.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:28.420
There's no material production
from having done it.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.918
There's no depletion,
there's no creation.

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:33.842
It's just an aesthetic instant.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:19.258
MILLER: And out there, when all that
holds you back is the horizon,

01:26:19.383 --> 01:26:21.010
that's real freedom.

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:30.777
