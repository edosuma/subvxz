MAN: - <i>This is the story of my brave,
foolish friend, Harry Deane.</i>

03:26.832 --> 03:29.927
<i>Mr Deane's work
as an art curator in London</i>

03:30.001 --> 03:33.380
<i>had gone, he felt,
largely unappreciated.</i>

03:33.463 --> 03:37.388
<i>He told me of countless insults
suffered at the hands of his employer,</i>

03:37.467 --> 03:42.394
<i>Lionel Shabandar,
media tycoon, art collector</i>

03:42.472 --> 03:45.066
<i>and an absolute brute of a fellow.</i>

03:45.142 --> 03:48.146
Do not touch my person. You!

03:48.228 --> 03:50.526
- Yes, my lord?
- Idiot! Give me your boot.

03:51.440 --> 03:55.070
<i>40 years ago,
I'd have called this Shabandar a cad.</i>

03:55.152 --> 03:57.780
<i>Now the prevailing parlance
for a fellow of this type</i>

03:57.904 --> 04:01.499
<i>is, I believe, shitbag.</i>

04:01.575 --> 04:02.622
Hello.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.749
This bloody thing is not operational.

04:04.828 --> 04:07.672
MAN: Ah, well, that's because,
I believe, my lord...

04:07.748 --> 04:11.093
Because you believe what,
you steaming turd?

04:11.209 --> 04:14.588
<i>Now he would have his revenge,</i>

04:14.671 --> 04:17.220
<i>for Mr Deane had a plan.</i>

04:17.298 --> 04:19.848
<i>To be grandiose, a heist.</i>

04:19.926 --> 04:22.725
<i>To be accurate, a bit of a thieving.</i>

04:22.804 --> 04:24.898
<i>This is where I came in.</i>

04:24.973 --> 04:30.355
<i>I am, you see,
a rather capable forger of fine art.</i>

04:30.479 --> 04:34.609
<i>I was pleased my little hobby
might prove of use to him.</i>

04:34.691 --> 04:40.198
<i>The plan relied on securing the aid
of one PJ Puznowski.</i>

04:40.280 --> 04:44.376
<i>"Find this Puznowski," Mr Deane told me,</i>

04:44.451 --> 04:47.921
<i>and it would all fall nicely into place.</i>

04:50.540 --> 04:52.508
Excuse me.
We were given to understand

04:52.584 --> 04:55.212
that there was an equestrian tourney
in the area.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.219
Well, we got a law attorney,

04:58.298 --> 05:01.552
don't know his religion,
up downtown Alpine.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.513
He's a fairy.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.436
Moved here from Albuquerque,

05:06.515 --> 05:09.519
it'll be five, no,
six years ago, come May.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.354
Not that I judge.

05:12.437 --> 05:16.067
How terribly interesting, but is there
a tournament of some description

05:16.149 --> 05:18.026
with various rowdy goings-on?

05:18.109 --> 05:21.158
Rough-riding,
bronc-busting sort of thing.

05:21.238 --> 05:25.709
It's a competition.
A test of skill involving farm animals.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.162
Yippee-ai-yay.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.497
(CHEERING)

05:29.579 --> 05:31.172
ANNOUNCER: <i>Alright, Pecos!</i>

05:31.248 --> 05:36.254
<i>This is the West of the Pecos Rodeo,
featuring America's number-one team,</i>

05:36.336 --> 05:41.058
<i>Team Ghostrider with Tim Lepard
and his cowboy monkeys.</i>

05:43.510 --> 05:45.638
Go on, Suzie! Go get 'em!

05:49.099 --> 05:52.774
<i>And it's brought to you by Charlie
Goodnight and all those good people</i>

05:52.853 --> 05:55.902
<i>down at Charlie Goodnight's
Implements 'n' Feed.</i>

06:05.407 --> 06:07.876
<i>Let's put some hands together
for the monkeys!</i>

06:09.870 --> 06:15.468
<i>And first out of the chute
is PJ Puznowski from down Terlingua way.</i>

06:15.542 --> 06:16.759
There.

06:16.835 --> 06:21.966
<i>Gonna try to put a rope around Rodney
from the Lazy L Sickle Y Bar Ranch.</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:25.268
<i>And, folks,
Rodney ain't gonna be heppin' any.</i>

06:35.562 --> 06:39.863
<i>That's 11.7 for PJ Puznowski!</i>

06:40.567 --> 06:43.411
- That's her.
<i>- Alright, Jammies!</i>

06:48.783 --> 06:51.036
<i>♪ If you wanna go</i>

06:52.454 --> 06:53.580
<i>♪ Let's go rodeo</i>

06:54.039 --> 06:56.792
<i>♪ If you wanna rock</i>

06:56.875 --> 06:59.674
What makes you so certain
she'll be game?

06:59.794 --> 07:03.264
Good God, she works in a poultry
processing plant for minimum wage.

07:03.340 --> 07:06.844
- You think she'll turn this down?
- How much are you going to tell her?

07:06.927 --> 07:09.430
Just as much as she needs to know.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.482
WOMAN: That's nice.

07:28.865 --> 07:32.620
This is Major Nigel Nelson-Wingate,
King's African Rifles, retired.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.670
- Sunday painter.
- Madam.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.260
HARRY: Now, the simple question is,

07:44.339 --> 07:48.890
how would you like to make
half a million pounds sterling?

07:49.844 --> 07:52.017
I have a little plan.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.570
Straight?

08:12.117 --> 08:14.336
CHAUFFEUR: - Have a good day, sir.
- Shut up.

08:27.716 --> 08:31.186
- Sorry, sir.
- Bloody hell, man, be careful!

08:31.261 --> 08:33.058
WOMAN: <i>Shabandar Media.</i>

08:33.138 --> 08:37.313
I wonder if you might approve this last
photo layout for the Horse and Hunt.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.024
Is there a problem, sir?

08:44.816 --> 08:47.319
Slazenger, give me a loupe.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.794
<i>Haystacks, Dusk.</i>

08:58.163 --> 08:59.506
Get me Harry Deane.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.847
Old man just called me up.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.307
Yes, he's expecting you.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.556
LIONEL: - No, no, no.
- Oh, I am sorry, sir.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.308
What? Come in.
Have them proof it quick as possible.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.020
We'll try and get it into next month's.
Deane, sit down.

09:21.853 --> 09:25.403
Have a look at these.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.739
I've sent the plane
to collect this woman.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.662
Arrives at Heathrow in about an hour.
You'll pick her up.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.991
Interesting. Oh, I see, the painting.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.920
- A reproduction, though, in my opinion.
- Bloody hell. Based on what?

09:37.994 --> 09:41.544
On the fact that it's hanging
on the wall of a caravan, sir, in Texas.

09:41.623 --> 09:46.754
Yes, precisely.
But whose caravan, you plank?

09:48.171 --> 09:52.096
- The cowgirl, sir.
- Puznowski, Deane.

09:52.175 --> 09:56.601
PJ Puznowski. Think, man.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.232
You stupid bastard, what!

10:14.739 --> 10:16.616
HARRY: Welcome to London.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.373
Before we throw you
into the thick of it,

10:19.452 --> 10:21.625
I should give you a bit
of the history.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.874
Monet's Haystacks.

10:25.041 --> 10:29.171
On September 15th, 1891, during
the course of one very productive day,

10:29.254 --> 10:31.097
the master Impressionist

10:31.172 --> 10:33.550
<i>finished two oii paintings:</i>

10:33.633 --> 10:36.682
<i>"Haystacks, Dawn",
"Haystacks, Dusk".</i>

10:36.761 --> 10:40.231
<i>"Haystacks, Dawn" was traded
amongst various private collectors</i>

10:40.306 --> 10:41.558
<i>over the years.</i>

10:41.641 --> 10:45.020
<i>"Haystacks, Dusk" was put on display
in Paris at the Jeu de Paume.</i>

10:45.103 --> 10:48.277
<i>That is,
until the Nazi occupation of 1941.</i>

10:51.359 --> 10:53.953
<i>"Haystacks, Dusk"
was carted off to Carinhall,</i>

10:54.070 --> 10:57.119
<i>the private residence
of Air Marshal Hermann Göring,</i>

10:57.198 --> 11:01.078
<i>for the delectation of his eyes only.</i>

11:01.161 --> 11:05.382
<i>In 1945, Carinhall is overrun
by the first division of Patton's army,</i>

11:05.456 --> 11:07.208
<i>the Big Red One.</i>

11:07.959 --> 11:14.183
<i>The point platoon is led
by Sergeant Brian "Bulldog" Puznowski,</i>

11:14.257 --> 11:16.635
<i>the Killer of Kilgore, Texas.</i>

11:16.718 --> 11:18.186
Your grandfather.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.898
For the next 67 years,
the whereabouts of <i>Haystacks, Dusk</i>

11:21.973 --> 11:25.352
has proved one of the art world's
most tantalising mysteries.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.187
And what is all this to Shabandar?

11:27.270 --> 11:30.194
A man of outsized appetites
and enormous enthusiasms,

11:30.273 --> 11:33.948
and no few eccentricities;
an avid nudist, a case in point.

11:34.068 --> 11:37.663
Owing to his considerable fortune
and my not inconsiderable knowledge,

11:37.739 --> 11:40.117
he has assembled
the most important collection

11:40.200 --> 11:42.749
of Impressionist masterpieces
in private hands.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.421
The prize? <i>Haystacks, Dawn.</i>

11:46.748 --> 11:49.627
<i>Acquired at auction 20 years ago
in spirited bidding.</i>

11:49.709 --> 11:53.634
The bid is with the gentleman
on the aisle. The bid is £8 million.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.557
MAN: - Good heavens.
- I have eight and a quarter.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.227
The bid is with the gentleman
on my left.

12:00.094 --> 12:04.474
The bid is against you, sir. The bid
is eight and a quarter million pounds.

12:04.599 --> 12:07.819
<i>Shabandar rolled
all his competitive impulses into a ball</i>

12:07.894 --> 12:11.273
<i>and outbid his great rival,
Akira Takagawa.</i>

12:12.273 --> 12:15.573
<i>He purchased the painting
for £11 million.</i>

12:20.531 --> 12:23.910
His ownership of the one has merely
whet his appetite for the other.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.917
For years now, Shabandar
has been seeking Haystacks, Dusk

12:26.996 --> 12:29.124
with a passion
bordering on monomania.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.675
When he saw that photograph,

12:30.750 --> 12:34.755
Shabandar conducted his own
investigation into your family history.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.716
Best to let the fish
work the hook in himself, eh, Major?

12:37.799 --> 12:39.722
Much the best, Mr Deane.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.224
He will want to negotiate
the price with you.

12:42.303 --> 12:45.182
You must stick at 12 million.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.142
Pounds.

12:47.225 --> 12:51.321
He'll pay it,
no matter how much he protests.

12:53.231 --> 12:56.986
Be firm. Be polite, but firm.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.033
He will try to charm you.
He will try to impress you.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.535
LIONEL: - Ms Puznowski!
- He will try to...

13:05.618 --> 13:07.871
An honour! Welcome, welcome.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.423
Painting in the gallery, men.

13:10.498 --> 13:13.593
I knew a Koznowski once,
charming man, no relation I suppose.

13:13.668 --> 13:17.923
Baron Koznowski. Quite the equestrian.
Man had horse blood in his veins.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.638
This way, please.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.596
Right, let's take a look, shall we?

13:23.678 --> 13:25.726
Mere formality, of course.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.899
Oh, yes.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.436
So...

13:35.273 --> 13:37.446
What do you think, Deane?

13:37.525 --> 13:41.746
- Yes, I'll need a few moments, sir.
- Oh, yes. Quite.

13:43.906 --> 13:46.329
LIONEL: You may not realise it,
Ms Puznowski,

13:46.451 --> 13:49.671
but Harry Deane knows Monet
like I know...

13:51.622 --> 13:54.045
Actually, I don't know anything
quite like that.

13:54.125 --> 13:57.925
The artist has used a light ground
true to Monet's habit.

13:58.004 --> 14:01.850
The palette is very limited,
no blacks or browns.

14:01.924 --> 14:06.054
Cerulean blue and cadmium yellow
to achieve his broken colour.

14:06.137 --> 14:10.142
And unlike the heartbreaking fraud
perpetrated on the Austrians,

14:10.224 --> 14:12.147
the signature is correct.

14:14.228 --> 14:18.825
It is Monet and it is very fine indeed.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.824
And that, Mr Deane,
is good enough for me.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.869
Shall we discuss terms?

15:11.994 --> 15:15.999

First class, of course.

15:16.082 --> 15:19.882
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Please, do not thank us.

15:19.961 --> 15:23.591
It is the Major and I who should be
thanking you for the self-possession,

15:23.673 --> 15:27.849
the good humour and the élan with which
you played your small but vital part.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.056
- Eh, Major?
- Hear, hear, sir. Jolly well played.

15:37.103 --> 15:40.573
Mr Deane? Mr Deane.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.535
Shouldn't have to tell her
any more than that.

15:44.610 --> 15:48.080
Quite right.
But you will have to talk to her.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.871
Hmm.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.000
Back in a flash.

<i>But, as we know, an optimist is simply

<i>As my time in the African Rifles
had taught me,</i>

16:18.227 --> 16:22.323
<i>one ignored the elephant in the room

16:41.125 --> 16:43.674
Major, for heaven's sake,
just be gentle.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.926
- I'm trying to get...
- No, that's enough.

16:46.005 --> 16:49.600
- Those people are barbarians.
- Other countries, other customs.

16:49.717 --> 16:53.347
- How are we going to meet this woman?
- I remember one night in Botswana...

16:53.429 --> 16:55.807
She's surrounded
by a Cro-Magnon Swiss Guard.

16:55.890 --> 16:59.690
This wasn't the plan, Major.
How are we going to get back on plan?

16:59.769 --> 17:02.613
You boys OK, huh?

17:02.688 --> 17:04.816
Faces still on right ways round?

17:06.067 --> 17:09.037
Yes, thank you.
All present and correct.

PJ: I do apologise on Merle.
He just loves a brawl.

17:12.615 --> 17:15.539
Nose been broke so many times,
he had the cartilage taken out

17:15.617 --> 17:18.087
so there wouldn't be downtime
between bar fights.

17:18.204 --> 17:22.425
An expedient we might consider
if we spend much more time in Texas.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.337
Heigh ho, friend.
I wouldn't recommend it.

17:26.420 --> 17:30.095
May I draw your attention to the matter
which brought us here to meet you?

17:31.676 --> 17:33.303
Sure.

17:33.386 --> 17:38.392
PJ: So you're saying
that's like $800,000 American? Wow!

17:38.474 --> 17:40.693
HARRY: We don't have the money yet.

17:40.768 --> 17:44.363

HARRY: - As long as we stay on plan.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.783

18:09.380 --> 18:13.055
Major, if you'd like to set
your camera up over there.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.555
Perhaps if your grandmother
would move over for a moment.

18:16.637 --> 18:22.064
Grandma Merle, these nice people
wanna take a picture here in the house.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.271
Is everyone in this state named Merle?

18:24.395 --> 18:27.524
- There you go.
- Good God. Is she unwell?

18:27.607 --> 18:30.110
Oh, no, she's fine.
Grandma Merle just chews.

18:30.192 --> 18:33.992
Ms Puznowski, could you slide
a little closer to your grandmother?

18:36.991 --> 18:39.540
Ready, ladies? Say cheese.

18:41.829 --> 18:45.675
WOMAN: <i>Hard facts,
honest reporting. Shabandar.</i>

18:45.750 --> 18:48.424
His door is rather firmly shut
at the moment.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.756
- Would you care to wait?
- Yes, thank you, I'll wait.

18:56.594 --> 19:00.849
WOMAN: <i>Lionel Shabandar
explains his formula for success</i>

19:00.931 --> 19:04.185
<i>in his startling
new autobiography, "Me".</i>

19:08.022 --> 19:12.493
<i>Welcome to the jungle.
We're here to help you cut through...</i>

19:12.568 --> 19:14.570
Huh!

19:16.364 --> 19:18.583
<i>Shabandar Media. Creating...</i>

19:33.130 --> 19:35.224
Go right in, Mr Deane.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.429
- Your lordship...
LIONEL: - Yes, Deane?

19:42.973 --> 19:45.522
That's a very nice suit, sir.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.854
- What?
- Nothing.

19:48.938 --> 19:52.613
I was leafing through the advance
on the <i>Horse and Hunt</i> the other day.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.787
- The layout pages.
- Why on earth were you doing that?

19:56.946 --> 20:00.667
Well, as a matter of fact, it's...
Well, why be coy?

20:00.741 --> 20:04.791
It's a simple explanation,
so simple, in fact, that I...

20:04.870 --> 20:08.716
Well, it's my favourite of your...
of your publications, sir.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.803
Our publications
here at Shabandar Media.

20:12.878 --> 20:17.884
Without wanting to overstate things,
I would say it may be my favourite...

20:17.967 --> 20:23.098
publication ever, without the...
qualification of Shabandar Media,

20:23.180 --> 20:24.557
et cetera, et cetera.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.143
- Do you ride?
- Good God, no.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.603
That is, I have ridden.

20:28.686 --> 20:31.690
A birthday party. They had ponies.
Little Shetland ponies.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.195
We traipsed around
in a circle in the garden.

20:34.275 --> 20:37.495
I was, oh, six, seven years old.

20:38.529 --> 20:41.373
It was my friend
Bobby Montaigne's birthday party.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.913
He's a speech pathologist now.

20:43.993 --> 20:47.372
And how well I remember it.
Made a deep impression, sir.

20:47.455 --> 20:50.880
- Is there something I can help with?
- Yes, sir, there is. Thank you.

20:51.000 --> 20:54.220
You see, I snuck an advance peek,
as I said, at the Horse and <i>Hunt.</i>

20:54.295 --> 20:57.720
I was struck most particularly
by the piece on this PJ Puznowski,

20:57.798 --> 20:59.846
the Texan horse person.

20:59.925 --> 21:04.146
Equestrienne,
not a mutant or a mythical creature.

21:04.263 --> 21:09.986
One imagines a... well, the bosom
of a woman and the hindquarters of...

21:10.060 --> 21:12.279
- Did you happen to see it, sir?
- Yes.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.865
I was struck by one particular picture.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.157
<i>Haystacks, Dusk.</i>

21:16.233 --> 21:20.579
- Yes. Exactly, sir.
- A reproduction, of course.

21:20.654 --> 21:24.375
Really? You think so, sir?
Based on what, if I may ask?

21:24.450 --> 21:28.830
Based on the fact that it was hanging on
the wall of a bloody caravan in Texas.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.627
There is that.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.130
- Is that all?
- Yes, sir.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.296
Thank you.

21:38.172 --> 21:41.426
But shouldn't we check, do research?
I could put together a memo.

21:41.509 --> 21:45.184
- One of your memos, yes.
- The painting is so rarely reproduced,

21:45.262 --> 21:47.640
I don't even know
if I've seen a reproduction.

21:47.723 --> 21:51.273
And it's the very incongruity of it,
hanging, as you so discerningly...

21:51.352 --> 21:54.731
Fine. Ring this woman up
and ask if she has an original Monet

21:54.814 --> 21:59.570
on the wall in Shitbird, Texas.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.249
MAJOR: - Did he bite, our little fishy?
- He's not hooked yet.

22:05.366 --> 22:08.495
- But he's circling the bait.
- Not sure I follow you, old thing.

22:08.619 --> 22:11.748
He's seen the painting
and he's considering being intrigued.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.175
- Considering?
- Considering being, yes.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.378
- Where's the girl?
- In a hotel in Dallas.

22:16.460 --> 22:20.260
- Why is she in a hotel in Dallas?
- The passport office is there.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.639
It turns out that the dear girl's
never been out of the country.

22:23.717 --> 22:28.644
Now, ordinarily, a passport takes
eight weeks, but they can expedite.

22:28.764 --> 22:32.189
Pay a couple of hundred pounds,
they'll hurry it along.

22:32.268 --> 22:36.239
That's very nice of them.
Couple of hundred.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.315
Right.

22:42.403 --> 22:43.950
Your post, Mr Deane.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.792
HARRY: It is extraordinary, isn't it?

22:52.872 --> 22:56.877
Well, it's very amusing if you should
turn out to have been right.

22:56.959 --> 23:01.055
I am here to amuse, sir.
So shall we bring her in?

23:01.130 --> 23:05.636
- <i>Who?</i>
- The cowgirl, sir. PJ Puznowski.

23:05.718 --> 23:09.143
Her grandfather, and all this
confirmed in the US military records,

23:09.221 --> 23:10.564
Bulldog Puznowski.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.560
Yes, yes, I read the memo,
but why would I bring her in?

23:13.642 --> 23:17.146
<i>If the painting is real
and if she wants to sell it,</i>

23:17.229 --> 23:20.859
<i>I certainly don't want to seem
overly eager. No, no, no, no.</i>

23:20.941 --> 23:23.990
Ring her up and tell her
if ever she finds herself in London,

23:24.069 --> 23:27.198
I'd be happy to carve out
a few minutes for a chat.

23:27.281 --> 23:30.034
<i>Let her invest
in the deal coming off.</i>

23:30.117 --> 23:33.792
- I see, sir. It's brilliant.
- Nonsense, Deane. It's elementary.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.836
- Prat.
- Wanker.

23:36.916 --> 23:40.966
HARRY: - Unrestricted economy fare.
- That's what they call it, sir.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.260
Of course, they use the word "economy"
with a certain looseness.

23:44.340 --> 23:47.344
Looseness? It's a positive leap
of the poetic imagination.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.269
Very good, sir. Well put.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.939
- Still, we can't count our pennies.
- Oh, no, sir.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.767
Not with millions in the offing.

23:54.850 --> 23:58.195
- There she is.
- Great to meet you. You take care.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.949
Hey, boys! Hi!

24:04.234 --> 24:07.408
Wow. That was a very comfortable flight.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.372
Excellent. Welcome to London.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.952
Thank you. Oh, thank you, Major.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.588
Yes, still holding.

24:17.414 --> 24:20.167
Can't see her today? Any time today?

24:20.250 --> 24:23.424
At the end of the day, could he see her?
Needn't take long.

24:25.089 --> 24:29.219
No, I understand. No, I understand.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.303
Right. Cheers.

24:34.848 --> 24:37.317
(RHYTHMIC THUDDING)

24:58.038 --> 25:01.508
Hey! Is this bothering you?

25:03.002 --> 25:04.754
Not at all.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.805
- I'm going to make some tea.
- OK.

25:11.093 --> 25:14.814
- What you got hanging here?
- Sorry?

25:14.888 --> 25:17.767
On your wall. Is this a Monet?

25:17.850 --> 25:19.022
Careful.

25:22.438 --> 25:25.783
Alfred Sisley. They were contemporaries.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.451
It's of his son, Pierre.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.204
The boy was ten at the time, I think.

25:35.117 --> 25:37.415
Sure is small.

25:37.494 --> 25:42.295
It cost me a ridiculous amount of money.
Rather put me in a hole.

25:44.168 --> 25:46.341
I like it.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.131
It's nice.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.140
It's very beautiful.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.220
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

25:58.265 --> 26:00.609
- Good morning.
- You know what time it is, mate?

26:00.684 --> 26:02.732
Yes, Mr Knowles. It's just coming...

26:04.897 --> 26:06.899
Morning.

26:10.527 --> 26:14.657

He can see us now.

26:31.173 --> 26:33.847
HARRY: - Let me do the talking.
PJ: - Sure.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.348
Ms Puznowski.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.521
- Howdy.
- Delighted to meet you.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.724
Good grief, Deane.
What happened to you?

26:39.848 --> 26:43.318
A fellow in the pub expressed
a preference for Matisse over Cézanne.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.737
Had to set him straight.
I'm joking, of course.

26:45.813 --> 26:48.441
Love Matisse. Use of colour.

26:48.524 --> 26:52.904
No, bent down to pick something up,
bookshelf in the way. Hello, bango.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.284
So, shall we sit?

26:55.364 --> 26:57.617
So, how do you find London?

26:57.699 --> 27:01.124
Well, everybody knows
the answer to that one.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.046
You turn right at Greenland.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.883
Indeed. And where are you staying?

27:06.959 --> 27:11.510
Er, well, one of them,
erm, big hotels downtown.

27:11.588 --> 27:14.387
I can't remember the name of it.
You remember, Harry?

27:14.466 --> 27:15.809
- Connaught.
- Me neither.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.266
- But it's one of them big ones.
- The Connaught.

27:18.345 --> 27:20.814
We spoke about the Connaught Hotel.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.070
That's a stupid name.
Staff seems pretty can-do.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.239
LIONEL:
You certain about the Connaught?

27:28.313 --> 27:29.986
- Sorry?
- It's fine, I suppose.

27:30.065 --> 27:33.285
But I'll make a few calls,
get our friend in at the Savoy.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.829
- I much prefer it.
- Sir, there's really no need.

27:35.946 --> 27:39.450
Let him do it, Harry. I'm sure
the service is plenty good there, too.

27:39.533 --> 27:42.207
Good anywhere, I reckon,
if you got the do-re-mi.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.954
And I don't mind shelling it out.

27:44.037 --> 27:48.918
I guess Harry here told you about
this here painting I'm aiming to unload.

27:49.001 --> 27:52.972
Ms Puznowski feels that in light of
the precedential value of the piece...

27:53.046 --> 27:55.140
LIONEL: You're hardly her agent, Deane.

27:55.215 --> 28:00.312
And anyway, Ms Puznowski seems
perfectly capable of expressing herself.

28:00.387 --> 28:03.061
PJ: - Well, yes, sir.
(CHAIR BANGS)

28:03.140 --> 28:05.484
Yes, sir. English is my mother tongue.

28:05.559 --> 28:08.403
But you don't have to Ms Puznowski me.

28:08.478 --> 28:10.822
No, you can call me PJ. Or Jammies.

28:10.898 --> 28:14.493
That's my rodeo handle.
Or Philomena, which is my real name.

28:14.568 --> 28:18.448
Well, thank you, PJ.
And you may call me Lionel.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.033
Let's hope doing business
on a first-name basis

28:21.116 --> 28:24.495
will be conducive to plain speaking
and clear understanding.

28:24.578 --> 28:27.252
Amen to that, Lionel.

28:27.331 --> 28:29.379
Well, then, let's get to it.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.711
I want £12 million
for this here picture.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.342
That's 6,000 tons
if I've clone my math right.

28:34.421 --> 28:38.016
And maybe you'd like to throw in
a nice four-by-four to haul it off in,

28:38.091 --> 28:42.096
with an auto tranny, a CD deck
and graduated tint on the windshields.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.806
Please and thank you.

28:44.556 --> 28:48.311
Well, that's marvellous,
and tell me, PJ,

28:48.393 --> 28:51.863
what makes you think
this painting is worth £12 million?

28:52.814 --> 28:58.412
Well, Lionel, first off, it's oil.
Ain't it, Harry?

28:58.487 --> 29:01.661
Indeed, the medium is oil,
and its provenance is promising.

29:05.994 --> 29:09.840
But I would like to take it to your
country house to compare it to its mate.

29:09.957 --> 29:12.506
LIONEL: - Is it being shipped in?
- Arrives Tuesday.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.678
LIONEL: You can run it up to the house.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.051
We'll take a look at it
at the gala on Wednesday.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.553
- You've never been to the house.
- No, sir, no. I...

29:19.633 --> 29:22.227
LIONEL: I have an annual party
up at the estate.

29:22.302 --> 29:25.806
That sounds nice. That's another thing
I got going in my favour.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.687
You've got this other Haystacks,

29:27.766 --> 29:31.191
and the man ain't churning 'em out,
what with his being dead an' all.

29:31.311 --> 29:36.442
So, looks like if you want the set,
I got you by the short and curlies.

29:36.525 --> 29:39.870
I don't think it's a situation
of one party trying to subdue the other.

29:39.945 --> 29:43.666
Nonsense. It's a pleasure doing business
with someone who knows her position

29:43.740 --> 29:46.209
and is able to clearly set it out.

29:47.703 --> 29:51.424
Unfortunately I have
another appointment at 11 o'clock.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.717
But I believe this is worth pursuing.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.888
Let's see if we mightn't find
some common ground.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.591
Why, thank you. A gentleman.

30:02.426 --> 30:03.598
Thank you.

30:03.677 --> 30:06.647
I'm booked the rest of the day
and I have a business dinner.

30:06.722 --> 30:10.693
But a thought occurs to me. Perhaps
you might be my dinner companion.

30:10.767 --> 30:14.738
We'd have time to talk and you might
even help me with a business matter.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.861
Thank you. That would be delightful.

30:16.940 --> 30:21.867
Don't bother yourself, Deane.
I'm sure PJ and I can handle things.

30:21.945 --> 30:23.822
To plain speaking.

30:23.905 --> 30:25.782
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Going down.</i>

30:25.866 --> 30:28.289
- Shall we say eight o'clock?
- Sure.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.620
Pick you up at...?

30:29.703 --> 30:32.422
- The Savoy.
- Why not?

MAJOR: <i>As I drove the two of them
to the most expensive hotel in London,</i>

30:43.008 --> 30:46.387
<i>I was rather taken by Ms Puznowski.</i>

30:46.470 --> 30:52.193
<i>Her invigorating lack of decorum
would have enraptured my younger self.</i>

30:52.267 --> 30:54.941
<i>Still, for the successful execution
of the plan,</i>

30:55.020 --> 30:59.400
<i>Mr Deane would require a firm hand
to bring her into line.</i>

30:59.483 --> 31:03.283
<i>I won't deny
I doubted the strength of his wrists.</i>

31:03.362 --> 31:05.660
HARRY: I don't think
I need to remind you, do I,

31:05.739 --> 31:07.616
of the consequences
of room service?

31:07.699 --> 31:10.248
PJ: - Uh-huh.
- This place is absurdly expensive.

31:10.327 --> 31:12.830
Well, this was all your idea.

31:12.913 --> 31:16.008
- Not your actually staying here.
- It's not my fault neither.

31:16.166 --> 31:19.591
We told him our story and either
we keep laying on the bamboozlement

31:19.669 --> 31:21.592
or we might as well
pack it in and go home.

31:21.671 --> 31:24.891
<i>Mamacita!</i> I bet this place has cable.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.803
What are you doing?

31:29.179 --> 31:31.477
The Major gave me a rag to dry this

31:31.556 --> 31:34.355
and, good God,
I believe it has motor oil on it.

31:35.644 --> 31:38.989
Hello. Do you have a single room?

31:39.064 --> 31:43.319
Very, very small. Tiny, in fact.
Just for one evening.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.450
Certainly, sir. I'll just take a look.

31:45.529 --> 31:49.830
Not even the whole evening necessarily.
We could just use it for...

31:49.908 --> 31:53.253
We are rather hemmed in
at the moment, sir.

31:53.328 --> 31:58.630
All I see for this evening is a very
comfortable suite overlooking the river.

31:58.708 --> 32:00.551
We'll take it.

32:00.627 --> 32:02.345
Hold on. What's the tariff?

32:02.421 --> 32:06.426
Hoss, if you're gonna nickel-and-dime
me, we can call this whole thing off.

32:06.508 --> 32:10.433
- I'm beginning to have second thoughts.
- Why would you have second thoughts?

32:10.512 --> 32:12.731
There's moral issues. Right and wrong.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.308
What would my momma have said

32:14.391 --> 32:17.691
if she saw me deceiving somebody
with you and your little Major?

32:17.769 --> 32:21.069
The Major has made quite a mess here.
It's really embarrassing.

32:21.148 --> 32:24.277
PJ: - Don't you feel a little ashamed?
- I'm not remotely ashamed.

32:24.359 --> 32:26.657
- Just run that through.
- Sir, I already have.

32:26.736 --> 32:30.707
There seems to be a problem with this
card. Perhaps you've exceeded the limit.

32:30.782 --> 32:35.709
Bloody hell. Alright, try the... This
is a mistake. Try the American Express.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.586
I don't know why I worry.
You ain't up to it anyway.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.760
- You or the Major.
HARRY: - The Major is quite capable.

32:41.835 --> 32:44.213
(LAUGHS) Well!
- What? What's the laugh for?

32:44.296 --> 32:47.220
Laughing at the Major?
He's handled better than you.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.768
He's been in any number
of sticky spots in and out.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.434
Should you choose to play coy
this late in the game,

32:52.512 --> 32:53.764
the Major would be aroused

32:53.889 --> 32:56.642
and I could not be held responsible
for the consequences.

32:56.725 --> 32:59.649
From what I've seen,
ain't nothin' gonna arouse the Major.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.777
Very good, sir.
This one worked brilliantly.

33:02.856 --> 33:06.486
There you are. That's room 344.

33:07.277 --> 33:10.907
This evening, it is very important
to stay on topic. Keep it businesslike.

33:10.989 --> 33:14.084
The man is not above mixing
the professional with the personal

33:14.159 --> 33:16.878
- to get what he wants.
- What's that supposed to mean?

33:16.953 --> 33:20.674
Don't make me say it.
The man is... Well, he's a cad.

33:20.749 --> 33:23.878
He's up to something.
He excluded me from your little date.

33:23.960 --> 33:29.467
Hell, maybe I don't mind being seduced,
chased after by a multi-zillionaire.

33:29.591 --> 33:31.889
I don't know,
that don't sound so terrible.

33:31.968 --> 33:35.893
What a depraved point of view.
The man's money makes him attractive?

33:35.972 --> 33:38.816
Yeah. Momma always called
money and manners

33:38.892 --> 33:40.815
the pork and beans of personality.

33:40.894 --> 33:44.068
- What an odd woman.
- There we are. 344, right?

33:44.147 --> 33:48.152
And I beg you,
do not abuse the minibar.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.578
Is that...

33:54.699 --> 33:56.701
Good God!

33:58.828 --> 34:01.206
- It's a Ming.
PJ: - Harry.

34:01.289 --> 34:02.461
Key.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.464
(PJ LAUGHS)

34:07.212 --> 34:09.886
- That's your side.
- This is a real nice car, Lionel.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.059
- It's nicer than my house.
- Indeed.

34:12.132 --> 34:14.010
PJ: Would you classify this as a limo?

34:14.094 --> 34:15.891
LIONEL: Well, I suppose you could.

34:25.105 --> 34:28.199
Shabandar.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.993
Yes. Good to see you.

34:30.068 --> 34:34.915
Martin Zaidenweber,
this is PJ Puznowski.

34:34.989 --> 34:39.166
- This is her? It's so nice to meet you.
- It's very nice to see you too.

34:39.244 --> 34:43.043
- Are you excited to be here in London?
- I'm so excited. It's my first time.

34:43.123 --> 34:45.251
No! No, come on.

34:45.333 --> 34:49.382
Now, I have heard about this painting.
I mean, what a story.

34:49.462 --> 34:52.056
Almost incredible. Almost incredible.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.134
I thought it'd be good
for you two to meet.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.219
Martin will be examining your painting.

34:56.303 --> 34:58.522
He's going to curate
my private collection.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.224
<i>Ja.</i>

35:01.099 --> 35:04.273
Wow. I thought that
that's what Harry did.

35:04.352 --> 35:08.357
For the moment,
but the man's a bit of an idiot.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.364
- Don't you think?
- No, no, no, Shabandar.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.241
No. Harry is a good man.

35:13.320 --> 35:16.494
Not much of an eye, but a good man.

35:17.991 --> 35:21.586
I am for five years a director
of the Kunst Museum in Köln.

35:21.661 --> 35:26.918
<i>Und</i> before that I curated the collection
of Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza.

35:27.000 --> 35:31.631
But the Baron's collection is...
heavily Flemish.

35:32.547 --> 35:38.225
Titian, Rubens,
all the women, so <i>saftig und heftig.</i>

35:38.303 --> 35:44.106
I mean, how many years can you spend
looking at the Walloons, huh?

35:44.184 --> 35:46.653
Anyway, now I prefer the Impressionists.

35:46.770 --> 35:50.115
<i>Und</i> I'm now considered
as the top man on Monet.

35:51.232 --> 35:53.906
Say, your English
is pretty darn good there, Martin.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.363
I mean, for someone
from the country of Germany.

35:56.446 --> 35:59.871
Oh, thank you. Well,
I speak eight languages fluently.

35:59.949 --> 36:04.204
<i>Und</i> I'm internet-savvy, but you have
to be these days, don't you think?

36:04.287 --> 36:06.961
I pluck chickens,
so there ain't a lot of call for me

36:07.040 --> 36:09.543
to be traipsing around
tweetin' and bloggin'.

36:09.626 --> 36:11.594
<i>Ja, ja.</i>

36:12.796 --> 36:16.096
I'm unfamiliar with this expression,
"I pluck chickens".

36:17.217 --> 36:19.219
Anyway, tell me this remarkable thing.

36:19.302 --> 36:22.146
This painting was hanging
always in your house,

36:22.222 --> 36:25.066
ever since you can remember,
even as a little kinder?

36:27.727 --> 36:28.774
Yep.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.620
Hmm!

36:43.827 --> 36:45.204
Bloody hell.

36:47.580 --> 36:52.461
- So, Harry's out on his butt, huh?
- Harry is, as you say, out on his butt.

36:53.336 --> 36:55.714
He's a bit of a disappointment, really.

36:55.839 --> 36:58.262
Something a little desperate
about the man.

36:58.341 --> 37:00.560
- I don't know.
- A little shifty, a little weak.

37:00.635 --> 37:01.978
Not that bright.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.227
I like to look a man in the eye,
"Lionel Shabandar, how do you do?"

37:05.306 --> 37:08.651
"This is what I should like. What do
you fancy?" Just have out with it.

37:08.727 --> 37:12.277
It's easier to live up to that when
you're rich and can call all the shots.

37:12.355 --> 37:15.575
Character is tested in many ways.
Money brings its own burdens.

37:15.650 --> 37:20.156
You, I'm certain, will pass every test.
Deane, I don't know.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.037
PJ: I think maybe
you're just not looking deep enough.

37:23.116 --> 37:27.212
Like Momma said, if you can't tell the
difference between a pig and a javelina,

37:27.287 --> 37:30.757
well, you could lose a big old chunk
out of your ass.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.593
Indeed.

37:37.005 --> 37:40.384
MAJOR: <i>Mr Deane was a proud man
in a difficult moment.</i>

37:40.467 --> 37:44.188
<i>His credit exhausted,
his coffers near empty,</i>

37:44.262 --> 37:48.062
<i>he was forced to contemplate
desperate measures.</i>

37:48.808 --> 37:52.813
<i>Yet he could allow no chink
to appear in the plan.</i>

37:52.896 --> 37:56.776
<i>And though his accomplice might seem,
shall we say, less than perfect,...</i>

37:56.900 --> 38:00.905
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
<i>- ..He would maintain control.</i>

38:00.987 --> 38:05.367
<i>These are the moments
that try men's souls.</i>

38:05.492 --> 38:07.711
So how is His Lordship this evening?

38:07.786 --> 38:09.538
- He's...
- No problems?

38:09.621 --> 38:13.125
- He wasn't rude or bullying, I hope.
PJ: - No, he was polite enough.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.087
Hey, Harry, what are you doing
with all your quarters?

38:16.169 --> 38:19.548
These, madam, are pounds and pence,
not quarters.

38:19.631 --> 38:23.261
- Just putting my affairs in order.
- Harry Deane, are you tapped out?

38:23.343 --> 38:28.600
Hardly. I do this periodically
so as to have use of the jar.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.309
I bag the coins
and donate the proceeds to charity.

38:31.392 --> 38:32.860
Uh-huh.

38:36.564 --> 38:37.861
Tea?

38:39.275 --> 38:43.496
So where do we stand with
our little affair, scheme, programme?

38:43.571 --> 38:46.871
You know, hoss,
I don't think it's gonna work out.

38:46.991 --> 38:49.835
What? Nonsense.
Everything's going according to plan.

38:49.911 --> 38:52.585
We have the painting,
or so Shabandar believes.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.793
And I, my dear, have
that credulous boob's confidence.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.752
On plan, don't you understand?

38:57.836 --> 39:01.340
Well, then, I guess it's just me
having second thoughts, then.

39:01.422 --> 39:04.972
Second thoughts? Well,
it's a little late for that, young lady.

39:05.051 --> 39:08.021
- Don't young lady me, hoss.
- Don't you hoss me, young lady.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.143
That is it.

39:10.515 --> 39:14.486
I have invested thousands of pounds
in this little caper of ours,

39:14.561 --> 39:19.362
not to mention the Major, who has
painted his heart, his soul, his guts

39:19.440 --> 39:21.317
into his forgery of Haystacks, Dusk.

39:21.401 --> 39:25.281
You call the Major, tell him about your
second thoughts, your silly little...

39:25.363 --> 39:28.116
What is it anyway?
Cold feet, moral qualms again?

39:28.199 --> 39:29.371
Yeah, that's part of it.

39:29.450 --> 39:32.670
Besides, the man
is a cold-blooded, heartless bully.

39:32.745 --> 39:35.339
- I happen to think he's quite charming.
- Charming?

39:35.415 --> 39:39.386
He's charming in a thoroughly reptilian,
repulsive way. Repulsively charming.

39:39.460 --> 39:42.088
But you fail to see his manners
are completely ersatz.

39:42.213 --> 39:44.215
I knew you were naive and provincial...

39:44.299 --> 39:47.894
And look at you,
trash-talkin' my origins!

39:47.969 --> 39:51.599
I respect your origins,
your entire double-wide way of life,

39:51.681 --> 39:53.854
but it does leave you vulnerable to...

39:53.933 --> 39:57.233
Leaves me vulnerable? I don't know
how to tell you this, Harry.

39:57.312 --> 40:00.532
- But you're fired.
- Oh, I'm fired?

40:00.607 --> 40:02.609
- Yep.
- Very amusing.

40:02.692 --> 40:06.071
Let me remind you who's running
this little enterprise, madam. Moi.

40:06.154 --> 40:09.784
And it is you who are fired!
Except you're not.

40:09.866 --> 40:14.417
In clue course, when I have authenticated
the Major's beautiful work, then,

40:14.495 --> 40:17.499
then we shall discuss
the termination of your employment

40:17.582 --> 40:19.380
and come to some understanding

40:19.459 --> 40:23.509
as to how to bear the onus
of your ridiculous expenses.

40:23.588 --> 40:28.344
Wrong, hoss. Wrong, wrong and wrong.

40:28.426 --> 40:32.272
You are fired, by Lionel,
cos he told me hisself.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.396
He introduced me to some
stuck-up heinie, Martin Zaidenweber,

40:35.475 --> 40:36.647
who's getting your job

40:36.726 --> 40:40.276
and you won't be authenticating
your dumb old hay painting.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.733
So I'm going back to the Savoy
to stay the night

40:42.815 --> 40:45.568
and I might just order up
some surf 'n' turf.

40:45.652 --> 40:49.031
And tomorrow I'm going to Texas,
get my job back at the chicken plant.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.660
It ain't no fault of mine

40:50.740 --> 40:53.664
that your whole cockamamie scheme
just went blooey.

41:14.430 --> 41:16.432
Hmm!

41:18.434 --> 41:19.777
(HARRY GRUNTS)

41:26.317 --> 41:29.161
- Zaidenweber.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

41:30.196 --> 41:33.325
Hmm. It's a little late
to apologise now.

41:37.537 --> 41:40.541
How could he? Zaidenweber.

41:40.623 --> 41:43.797
The man is a... Admittedly he knows
his way around the Walloons.

41:43.876 --> 41:47.631
But when it comes to the Impressionists,
the man is a hopeless ignoramus.

41:47.714 --> 41:50.593
This would be comical
if it weren't actually dangerous.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.222
I refer not just to my nose,

41:52.301 --> 41:55.555
which this time I fear
may be well and truly broken.

41:55.638 --> 41:58.357
Perhaps since our little caper
is far from over,

41:58.433 --> 42:01.653
perhaps we should consider
removing the cartilage.

42:01.728 --> 42:04.948
Don't be an ass. I'm hardly likely
to be hit in the face a third time.

42:05.023 --> 42:06.900
That was the third time, sir.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.368
This isn't a maths class.

42:09.444 --> 42:12.618
What are we going to do about
Zaidenweber who, once hired on,

42:12.697 --> 42:16.372
is not going to authenticate
our dumb old hay painting?

42:18.369 --> 42:21.293
Perhaps, Major, could you not
contrive to neutralise him

42:21.372 --> 42:25.172
simply with a...
well, with a gun of some sort?

42:25.251 --> 42:29.472
With a silencer screwed onto the tip
of the thing, the barrel there?

42:30.465 --> 42:33.594
MAJOR: - Mr Deane.
- Hmm?

42:33.676 --> 42:36.429
Too much? No, you're right,
it's too outlandish.

42:36.512 --> 42:38.514
I'll take care of Zaidenweber.

42:38.598 --> 42:41.067
More pressing is how do we get
our rogue elephant

42:41.184 --> 42:43.858
out of the most expensive hotel
in London?

42:44.812 --> 42:49.238
Oh, er, sorry, sir. I haven't quite got
the knack of this.

42:50.359 --> 42:53.283
She is a person without vision, Major.

42:53.362 --> 42:57.287
She cannot see the plan,
so she will not believe in the plan.

42:57.366 --> 43:00.916
Instant gratification is her
<i>modus vivendi</i>, discipline a dirty word.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.544
There's something
awfully refreshing about her.

43:03.623 --> 43:06.968
There's something refreshing
about being plunged into an ice bath

43:07.043 --> 43:08.841
and flogged with a birch switch.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.548
Oh, yes, good flogging.

43:11.631 --> 43:15.852
Madam Olga, Pennypockets Lane,
third floor to the rear.

43:18.387 --> 43:20.014
(MOBILE RINGS)

43:20.932 --> 43:22.650
- Yeah?
HARRY: <i>- Martin?</i>

43:22.725 --> 43:27.071
<i>- Ja,</i> this is Martin Zaidenweber, <i>ja.
- Martin, it's Harry.</i>

- How's Cologne?
- Köln?

43:38.032 --> 43:41.377
Oh, <i>ja!</i> Köln is... is good, not so bad.

43:41.452 --> 43:44.331
<i>Of course, I'm in Köln.
You catch me at my gym.</i>

43:44.413 --> 43:49.010
Practising physical culture. I am gaily
shvitzing away the kilos, you know?

43:49.961 --> 43:52.214
We have to fight the heftiness!

43:52.296 --> 43:54.298
Oh, absolutely.

43:54.382 --> 43:57.101
Look, I know this will seem
a little out of the blue,

43:57.176 --> 43:59.144
and it's sort of embarrassing to say,

43:59.262 --> 44:02.186
but I'm calling to ask
if you might have a job on offer soon.

44:02.265 --> 44:04.359
- Job?
<i>- I'm going to be free soon.</i>

44:04.433 --> 44:06.310
I'm about to kiss Shabandar off.

44:06.394 --> 44:09.864
- You will kiss him off?
<i>- Quitting, yes.</i>

44:09.981 --> 44:13.030
<i>Rather embarrassing,
but Shabandar's having problems.</i>

44:13.109 --> 44:14.611
<i>Business problems.</i>

44:14.694 --> 44:17.664
Rumour has it he's built himself
a bit of a house of cards.

44:17.738 --> 44:20.036
- A card house?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

44:20.783 --> 44:24.754
Just last week,
my pay cheque didn't clear.

44:30.418 --> 44:32.170
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

44:32.295 --> 44:35.424
- What can we do for you?
- Well, I'm checking my friend out.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.600
Lovely room.
She's quite enjoyed her stay.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.895
But I can authorise no further payments
against my credit card.

44:40.970 --> 44:43.473
So we're going to have to
throw her out on her ear.

44:43.556 --> 44:45.650
- Actually...
- Give her the old heave-ho.

44:45.725 --> 44:47.443
Bags packed, out on the pavement.

44:47.518 --> 44:52.570
Actually, sir, those charges have been
assumed as of 4:17 this afternoon

44:52.648 --> 44:54.150
by another party.

44:54.233 --> 44:59.239
In fact, I believe she has been
moved up to a senior suite.

44:59.363 --> 45:02.082
Senior suite.

45:02.158 --> 45:04.536
She's been moved up to...
Who the bloody hell...?

45:04.619 --> 45:07.964
RECEPTIONIST: Lord Shabandar
called round. You just missed him.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.459
He left with the young lady
in evening wear.

45:11.542 --> 45:12.794
ASSISTANT: Hmm.

45:12.877 --> 45:14.720
- Evening wear?
- Yes, sir.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.422
- Quite striking.
- Indeed.

45:16.505 --> 45:19.258
RECEPTIONIST:
A gift from His Lordship.

45:19.383 --> 45:22.637
Fine. Excellent. Well, good, then.

45:22.720 --> 45:26.224
RECEPTIONIST: But I'd be happy
to close out your account. Let me see.

45:26.390 --> 45:29.644
Charges accumulating
prior to this evening...

45:29.727 --> 45:31.195
Yes, here we are.

45:34.982 --> 45:37.701
It'll just be two shakes, sir.

45:47.536 --> 45:51.006
How is the...
the Major this evening, sir?

45:52.959 --> 45:55.132
- Hmm?
- The Major.

45:56.504 --> 45:58.506
He's alright, I suppose.

45:59.423 --> 46:03.018
- Seems like a busy little fellow.
- Not so little, I would hazard.

46:05.554 --> 46:07.522
He's lost a bit of weight recently.

46:08.474 --> 46:11.523
- Semi-retired now.
- That is a pity, sir.

46:11.602 --> 46:15.448
- At least it's... semi.
- Hmm.

46:16.315 --> 46:17.658
(PRINTER BEEPS)

46:21.362 --> 46:24.457
Leaving that on the American Express
card, are we, sir?

46:24.532 --> 46:26.250
Yes, thank you.

46:26.325 --> 46:28.498
(PRINTER BEEPS)

46:33.374 --> 46:34.842
(PRINTER BEEPS)

46:40.214 --> 46:43.889
Now, the task this evening
is quite straightforward.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.891
The Japanese ran the world in the '80s

46:45.970 --> 46:48.814
and my little friend Takagawa
screwed me a dozen times.

46:48.889 --> 46:51.108
Well, now the boot is on the other foot.

46:51.183 --> 46:53.936
So it's kind of like a grudge match.

46:54.020 --> 46:56.944
He's still pissed off
that I beat him to Haystacks, Dawn.

46:57.023 --> 47:00.618
Now, if I can get his lackeys to sell me
their 220 television channels,

47:00.693 --> 47:04.789
I become the third largest provider
of premium cable in the whole of Asia

47:04.864 --> 47:09.370
and the Shabandar lion
can finally roar over Japan.

47:12.455 --> 47:15.800
Hello. Good day, Mr Shabandar.

47:15.875 --> 47:20.051
I am your interpreter
from Konichiwa Media Group.

47:20.129 --> 47:23.224
- I am Chuck.
- Delighted to meet you.

47:24.008 --> 47:27.854
This is Ms Philomena Puznowski.

47:27.928 --> 47:29.271
Hi.

47:29.347 --> 47:34.774
Hello. Good day. I am your interpreter
from Konichiwa Media Group.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.820
I am Chuck.

47:36.896 --> 47:40.366
This is Mr Katsuhara Cho.

47:40.483 --> 47:44.659
Very powerful big man
of Konichiwa Media Group.

47:44.737 --> 47:50.494
I present Mr Shabandar
and Ms Puznoskusam.

47:50.576 --> 47:51.998
(LAUGHS)
- Marvellous.

47:59.043 --> 48:02.138
I think we'll just pick up the names
as we go along, don't you?

48:02.213 --> 48:07.014
- It's a pleasure to meet you all.
- And that goes double for me.

48:07.093 --> 48:09.937
As I said,
these dinners can be difficult.

48:10.012 --> 48:12.481
Don't worry.
These guys seem pretty harmless.

48:12.556 --> 48:15.184
They're evil little shits.
Watch me crush them.

48:20.981 --> 48:25.077
It occurs to me, I'm afraid
I left my glasses up in the room.

48:25.152 --> 48:29.202
Would it... Would the key still work
for me to run up and have a look?

48:29.281 --> 48:33.331
- You're wearing them, sir.
- These, to be sure, yes.

48:33.411 --> 48:36.915
No, I mean my other glasses,
my distance glasses.

48:38.958 --> 48:40.505
Distance.

48:40.584 --> 48:43.554
I'll run you another key, sir.

...my offer for the group was made
in pounds sterling, not yen.

51:07.815 --> 51:11.194
But the recent rise of your currency
relative to the pound

51:11.277 --> 51:14.201
would raise my cost fully ten percent,

51:14.280 --> 51:17.124
and that, gentlemen,
is an obligation I never undertook

51:17.199 --> 51:20.703
and do not propose to undertake now.

51:29.295 --> 51:32.265
There is snow on the mountains
in the winter

51:32.339 --> 51:35.434
and the man, in despair,

51:35.509 --> 51:38.763
cannot walk to the next valley.

51:38.846 --> 51:43.477
But in spring, snow melts

51:43.559 --> 51:47.780
and is remembered in tranquillity.

51:49.189 --> 51:52.284
Right. Sure, OK, I got you.

51:52.359 --> 51:56.114
Yeah, see, what I think the big man here
is trying to tell you is

51:56.196 --> 51:59.575
he may have been tough on the price
and a real son of a bitch until now,

51:59.658 --> 52:03.834
but if you kind of party down with him
so he don't lose face,

52:03.912 --> 52:05.505
maybe things'll go your way.

52:05.581 --> 52:09.427
But he ain't about to say it straight
out and look like a wimp, right?

52:12.046 --> 52:14.469
If you really wanna
butter these boys up,

52:14.548 --> 52:17.392
you ought to invite them all
out to your house.

You know, break some bread, mano a mano.

52:21.972 --> 52:24.976

why don't you?

52:25.059 --> 52:26.732
Maybe you're right.

53:35.129 --> 53:38.759
You're a bit of a marvel. I hope
you'll stay on, even after the gala.

53:38.882 --> 53:41.055
I could use somebody
with your qualities.

53:41.176 --> 53:43.645
Well, I guess I got qualities at that.

53:43.721 --> 53:47.646
That you do, Ms Puznowski.
That you do.

53:47.725 --> 53:51.480

you really are trying to get me drunk,

- Let us get down.

- What?

It was a bloody chore hiring him.

01:13:54.513 --> 01:13:56.607
I had to advance him two years' salary.

01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.895
- Zaidenweber?
- Zaidenweber.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:16.044
I am pleased to inspect.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.460
- Fine, but I hardly think you're...
- Stand down, Deane.

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:29.473
How does it look, Martin?
What do you say?

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:38.854
Ja. Almost incredible.

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:42.732
Almost incredible.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:45.906
But...

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:59.374
Yeah.

01:15:00.621 --> 01:15:02.294
The painting is in order.

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:04.796
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
LIONEL: - Hm-hmm.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:07.628
MARTIN:
The brush strokes. The impasto.

01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:11.342
Everything is just quite the way
it should be.

01:15:11.424 --> 01:15:14.303
And there are certain things
that you cannot phoney up.

01:15:14.385 --> 01:15:18.481
Gross depiction, maybe, but
the finer fingerprints of technique, no,

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:20.479
absolutely not, you cannot, no.

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:25.064
I mean, this is, I have to say,
really quite bloody marvellous.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.781
This is authentic.

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:31.737
Now, you can do tests
until your testicles are cerulean blue,

01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:34.948
but there is no doubt in my mind.

01:15:35.031 --> 01:15:37.204
LIONEL: - Alright, then.
- Bollocks.

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:42.838
- I beg your pardon?
- Bollocks.

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:44.130
Excuse me?

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:52.348
Anyone with an eye can see
that something is amiss here.

01:15:52.423 --> 01:15:54.346
What the devil are you...?

01:15:55.134 --> 01:15:58.104
(YELLS)
- Harry!

01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:00.356
(GASPS)

01:16:00.431 --> 01:16:02.900
Fake.

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:06.195
The impasto is a caricature
of Monet's actual brush handling,

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:08.531
which was infinitely more subtle.

01:16:08.606 --> 01:16:11.780
And as far as I'm aware,
Monet never painted over

01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:14.282
a rather hackneyed portrait of...

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:23.954
LIONEL: Martin.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.502
I'm disappointed.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.922
(RETCHES)

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:39.854
Imagine how I feel.

01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:48.316
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, meine Lieblinge.</i>

01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:57.785
And as for you, you're either
rather clever or not clever enough.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:01.458
Either way, it's clear
that you're of no further use to me.

01:17:01.534 --> 01:17:03.912
Speaking of clever, what did you expect?

01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:06.292
It was hanging on a wall
in a trailer in Texas.

01:17:06.372 --> 01:17:10.422
And besides,
I was never gonna be any use to you.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:14.131
Well, no harm done.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:19.894
Just a bit of a waste of time,
that's all.

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:23.314
Well, Deane, against expectations,

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:25.767
you seem to know
what you're on about rather.

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:28.319
You will continue in the job.

01:17:28.394 --> 01:17:30.988
- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- I think not, sir.

01:17:34.316 --> 01:17:35.533
You think not what?

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:38.704
I think not regarding
continuing in the job.

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:41.077
I'm afraid I can no longer
render services

01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:45.333
to a man who'd wilfully insult
the intelligence and moral character

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:48.381
of a woman I have so come
to admire and respect.

01:17:52.793 --> 01:17:54.795
You are a boor, sir.

01:17:55.963 --> 01:17:59.058
And a bully. And I've had enough.

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:01.727
So I'll just gather my kit...

01:18:04.138 --> 01:18:07.688
...and bid you a semi-fond farewell.

01:18:08.934 --> 01:18:10.857
Ms Puznowski, may I see you out?

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.690
Yes, you may.

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:16.867
HARRY: Excuse me.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.656
You know, Harry Deane,

01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:24.868
for an Englishman, you sure do have
some big old cojones.

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:39.928
MAJOR: <i>They say
you can't put a price on dignity,</i>

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:43.602
<i>but if you could, in Harry Deane's case,</i>

01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:48.103
<i>it would be approximately £11 million.</i>

01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:50.856
Well, that didn't go
exactly according to plan.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:56.608
I know it sounds funny coming from me,
but now I wish you'd let him buy it.

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:58.863
I just couldn't help myself, you know?

01:18:58.943 --> 01:19:00.695
Hear, hear.

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:03.371
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:05.867
No, no, you did your bit.
I owe you your wages.

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:10.497
Here we are.

01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:14.625
Well, here we are.

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:37.360
Your tickets.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:40.576
- I regret that it's economy.
- Unrestricted.

01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:49.953
- Well, goodbye, Harry.
- Goodbye.

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:02.131
PJ: Come here.

01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:08.846
- Major.
- Madam.

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:24.987
Shall we, Major?

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.497
No problems, then, sir?

01:20:31.577 --> 01:20:34.205
Security was a little tougher
than I'd anticipated.

01:20:34.288 --> 01:20:36.791
MAJOR: <i>But you had time
to make the switch?</i>

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:39.627
DEANE: <i>Oh, yes.
Shabandar will never suspect.</i>

01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:41.087
<i>Beautiful work, Major.</i>

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.389
MAJOR: - On which one?
HARRY: - Both of them.

01:20:43.464 --> 01:20:47.219
Although I'm afraid I had to destroy
your Dusk to prove it was a fake.

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:50.271
Understood, sir. No hard feelings.

01:20:58.103 --> 01:21:02.950
Thoughtful of this gentleman to make
the trip. Saves us going to Japan.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.203
Mr Takagawa.

01:21:06.278 --> 01:21:08.326
- Hello, Harry.
HARRY: - Hello, Charlie.

01:21:08.405 --> 01:21:10.624
Hello, Major. Everything alright?

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:13.828
- Everything according to plan.
- Right you are, Mr Deane.

01:21:14.995 --> 01:21:16.588
- Very good.

01:21:19.249 --> 01:21:21.251
(SPEAKS JAPANESE)

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.305
Mr Takagawa wants to thank you.

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:28.885
He says he has been waiting 18 years
for this moment.

01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:31.853
(SPEAKS JAPANESE)
- Not at all. Pleasure to have done it.

01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:34.273
(SPEAK JAPANESE)

01:21:34.348 --> 01:21:35.691
Oh, yes.

01:21:35.766 --> 01:21:38.895
I'm clever. But look.

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:42.398
Monet.

01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:47.078
Inimitable. Though no doubt
your version will satisfy Shabandar.

01:21:47.152 --> 01:21:49.154
(SPEAKS JAPANESE)

01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:53.500
He assures me
the transfer has been made.

01:21:53.617 --> 01:21:55.836
The money should now be
in your Swiss account.

01:21:55.911 --> 01:21:58.130
- Excellent.
MAJOR: - Hello?

01:21:58.205 --> 01:22:00.207
Major?

01:22:01.250 --> 01:22:03.753
It's gone through.

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:05.930
So much better
than having to count it all.

01:22:06.004 --> 01:22:09.759
I'd have got it all bollocksed up
before I got to ten million.

01:22:09.842 --> 01:22:12.311
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Thank you, Harry.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:16.269
Has anyone given you anything
to take on board our flight?

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:18.396
- No, ma'am.
- Thank you.

01:22:35.868 --> 01:22:37.870
Oh, Harry Deane.

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:41.999
HARRY: You'll see
she gets what we owe her?

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:45.757
MAJOR: Certainly, sir.
And should we upgrade her ticket?

01:22:45.836 --> 01:22:48.009
Yes, why don't we?

01:22:48.088 --> 01:22:50.841
- Bit of an extravagance.
- Oh, well.

01:22:51.925 --> 01:22:54.428
How will you explain it?

01:22:54.553 --> 01:22:57.022
You know me, Major.
I'll think of something.

01:22:58.599 --> 01:23:00.601
Fancy trying your hand at Picasso?

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:02.854
MAJOR:
Do you think we'd find a use for it?

01:23:02.936 --> 01:23:05.780
HARRY: Seems Donald Trump
is obsessed with the fellow.

01:23:05.856 --> 01:23:08.780
And there's many a billionaire in Texas.

01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:10.111
MAJOR: Mr Deane.

01:23:10.194 --> 01:23:14.415
