            <i>I see, huh?</i>         

00:10.284 --> 00:11.268
Yeah, you betcha.

Look at this headline here.

you don't actually believe      
that pack of lies, do you?      

00:20.128 --> 00:22.229
    Well, Dr. Crane, it just    
  shows you how much you know   

00:22.263 --> 00:24.048
        about free press        
        here in America.        

00:24.082 --> 00:26.817
I mean, uh, they can't print it 
     unless it's the truth.     

00:26.852 --> 00:28.151
Well, granted, you know,        

00:28.186 --> 00:30.104
     some of these stories      
  might be a bit exaggerated,   

00:30.138 --> 00:32.421
    but, uh, I guarantee you    
      at the core of each       

00:32.456 --> 00:33.506
    is the kernel of truth.     

00:33.541 --> 00:34.608
    Allow me to demonstrate.

             may be a little bit

00:48.406 --> 00:49.856

          I won $500,

                maybe $5,000,

the essence of the message

         doesn't happen to be

             He gave Cheers     
             a really bad review
             a couple years ago.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.221
                     Really bad.

03:17.255 --> 03:20.741
                I almost stopped
                coming here.    

03:20.775 --> 03:22.159

 A lot of things have changed.

Like what?                      

03:33.071 --> 03:36.923
                  We have ferns.

03:36.958 --> 03:37.908
                  Didn't he say 
                  anything nice?

03:37.942 --> 03:39.542
Yes, as a matter of fact,       
he said                         

03:39.577 --> 03:41.845
the one saving grace was        
the refreshing lack of ferns.

            trying to rattle me.

 everything's going to be fine.

03:55.894 --> 03:57.227
         Oh, Carla, Eddie called

03:57.261 --> 03:58.862
        and said he got a job   
        as a penguin.           

03:58.897 --> 04:01.014
             Great!

        everybody?              

04:03.234 --> 04:06.503
My husband just hooked on       
 with the Pittsburgh Penguins.

on his way to becoming a legend.

 Gee, Cliff, what a great thing 
        to say, thanks.

         best about that team...

What?                           
              is their uniforms.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.024
  I mean, the Penguin uniforms  
        are far and away        

04:28.059 --> 04:29.426
the coolest in the league.

uniforms that neat-looking too?

to find work,

support you and the kids.

It's like I was                 
losing myself as a man.

Well, now, you know,            
I got a job.                    

04:55.520 --> 04:56.653
Aren't you proud of me?         

04:56.687 --> 04:59.440
                 Eddie, take off
                 your beak.     

05:01.076 --> 05:02.159
          This is a joke, right?

05:02.193 --> 05:03.593

      Can it, you clowns.       

05:31.072 --> 05:34.140
You know, a lot of people       
criticize hockey players.       

05:34.175 --> 05:35.859
They say they're                
wasting their time.

After their careers             
are over                        

05:37.445 --> 05:39.029
            they're not prepared
            for anything.

I thought you'd get             
a kick out of it.

to Seattle tomorrow.

        You can't fly in        
      that thing, can you?      

05:56.581 --> 05:59.399
No, Woody, I'm going            
on an airplane.                 

05:59.434 --> 06:02.536
I know, I mean you're not going 
to fly in that thing, are you?  

06:02.570 --> 06:04.187
                        Seattle?

06:04.221 --> 06:05.989
                 I just...      
                 I can't believe

06:06.024 --> 06:07.958
              you're going to be
              that far away.    

06:07.992 --> 06:09.476
It won't be that long.          

06:09.510 --> 06:11.545
Look, I'll call you             
every day.                      

06:11.579 --> 06:14.181
Hey, maybe you want             
to come out and see me, huh?    

06:14.215 --> 06:15.999
             Yeah. Yeah, well...

06:16.033 --> 06:17.801
        you know, it's really   
        a long way, Eddie.      

06:17.835 --> 06:19.570
             We'll talk about it
             tonight, okay?     

06:19.604 --> 06:21.004
                What do you want
                for dinner?     

06:21.038 --> 06:22.206
I don't know.                   

06:22.240 --> 06:24.274
I kind of got the urge          
for mackerel.                   

06:25.960 --> 06:28.045
Gee, I'm sure going             
to miss you, Carla.             

06:28.079 --> 06:29.696
             Well, who wouldn't?

06:29.731 --> 06:32.683
             You know, not to be
             overly sentimental,

06:32.717 --> 06:35.569
             but you're the best
             husband I ever had.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.370
I'll see you, Carla.            

06:37.405 --> 06:39.205
                 Yeah, see ya...

06:39.240 --> 06:40.441
                    Penguin.    

06:41.810 --> 06:43.961
      I wonder where couples get
      those cute little names   

06:43.995 --> 06:46.730
        they call each other.   

06:53.220 --> 06:55.622
          Well, soon.           

06:55.657 --> 06:58.525
Eddie, look, I just can't       
        fly out of here.        

06:58.559 --> 07:01.327
    Are you forgetting          
    I got seven kids?           

07:01.362 --> 07:03.997
    Oh, right, eight.           

07:04.032 --> 07:05.999
         Look, look, I'd love to
         talk to you some more, 

07:06.034 --> 07:07.400
        but Sam's calling me.   
What?                           

07:07.434 --> 07:08.635
                    ( <i>stamps</i> )  
    Ow!                         

07:08.670 --> 07:11.138
            Be right there, Sam.

07:11.172 --> 07:13.674
          Okay, I'll talk to you
          tomorrow then, bye.   

07:13.708 --> 07:15.876
                 Hey, uh, Carla,

07:15.910 --> 07:16.659
I couldn't help but notice      

07:16.694 --> 07:18.679
      that Eddie calls you      
        every single day        

07:18.713 --> 07:19.863
  asking you to go out there,   

07:19.897 --> 07:21.782
    and you just keep           
giving him the brush-off.       

07:21.816 --> 07:24.551
 I mean, hey, what gives here,  
          little lady?          

07:24.585 --> 07:25.302
    Drop it.                    

07:25.336 --> 07:26.920
Or I'll set                     
your face on fire               

07:26.955 --> 07:29.790
and beat out the flames         
with your butt.                 

07:31.292 --> 07:35.445
         Well, does that satisfy
         your curiosity, Cliff? 

07:35.480 --> 07:36.630
    Totally.                    

07:36.664 --> 07:40.450
But it does raise               
a series of other questions.    

07:41.769 --> 07:42.736
                  Hey, hey, hey.

07:42.770 --> 07:44.488
              That restaurant   
              critic guy's here.

07:44.522 --> 07:45.555
Where?                          

07:45.589 --> 07:46.373
                     Right over 
                     there, see?

07:46.407 --> 07:47.791
Oh, my God.                     

07:47.825 --> 07:48.892
      How do I look, Sam?       

07:48.926 --> 07:49.959
    You've got a little drool   

07:49.994 --> 07:51.194
            on the corner of    
            your mouth there.   

07:51.228 --> 07:52.813
        No, no, no, leave it.   

07:52.847 --> 07:54.214
I think I better                
go see what he wants.           

07:54.249 --> 07:55.565
                 No, relax.     
                 Carla's got it.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.151
Oh, my God!                     

08:03.257 --> 08:04.907
 Carla, you don't mind, do you? 

08:04.942 --> 08:06.143
                     Not at all.

08:06.177 --> 08:07.210
            When you're through,

08:07.245 --> 08:09.146
        there's a table         
        of six in the corner.   

08:10.414 --> 08:11.781
                    Hello.      

08:11.815 --> 08:14.867
    You're Murray Treadwell,    
          aren't you?           

08:14.902 --> 08:18.571
    Yes, and you must be one    
    of the Flying Wallendas.    

08:20.141 --> 08:22.408
     No, I'm Rebecca Howe.      
I'm the new manager here.       

08:22.443 --> 08:24.695
                I hope you enjoy
                your visit here.

08:24.729 --> 08:26.479
      Oh, I'm sure I will.      

08:26.514 --> 08:27.213
    Would you like a drink?     

08:27.248 --> 08:30.150
That seems vaguely appropriate. 

08:30.184 --> 08:32.318
                    I'll get it.

08:32.352 --> 08:34.587
    You probably want           
      something specific.       

08:34.621 --> 08:37.006
How about a vodka martini?      

08:37.041 --> 08:37.874
    Excellent choice.           

08:37.908 --> 08:38.958
    Anything special?           

08:38.993 --> 08:40.760
  Stirred, shaken, two olives?  

08:40.794 --> 08:42.345
        A little sword?         

08:42.380 --> 08:44.131
    I'd like it today.          

08:44.164 --> 08:45.549
        Coming right up.        

08:45.583 --> 08:47.834
Vodka martini for Mr. Treadwell 
      and make it snappy.       

08:47.869 --> 08:51.487
    Oh, no, that's the one drink
    I don't know how to make.   

08:57.928 --> 09:00.664
    Things seem to be           
    going very well.            

09:00.698 --> 09:02.266
            Yeah, just make sure
            he gets a napkin.   

09:02.300 --> 09:04.318
              We only lost about
              a thousand points 

09:04.352 --> 09:05.418
              on that last time.

09:05.453 --> 09:07.270
             As if it would have
             really killed him  

09:07.305 --> 09:10.173
            to use              
            the paper towels.   

09:10.208 --> 09:11.658
        Thank you, Sam.         

09:12.610 --> 09:14.327
     Here you go, Mr. Treadwell.

09:14.362 --> 09:16.829
     Notice the cocktail napkin.

09:16.864 --> 09:21.368
    There's plenty more         
    where that one came from.   

09:21.402 --> 09:23.570
Mm, very nice.                  

09:23.604 --> 09:25.572
            Yes, we make        
            a good martini here.

09:25.606 --> 09:27.373
         Oh, that, too.         

09:29.727 --> 09:31.661
    Very sweet of you.          

09:31.695 --> 09:33.563
Do you have any questions       
         about Cheers?          

09:33.597 --> 09:35.014
        Actually, I do.         

09:35.049 --> 09:37.584
      But, unfortunately,       
 I'm running a little bit late. 

09:37.618 --> 09:41.187
    Would you, by any chance    
  be free for dinner tonight?   

09:41.221 --> 09:42.388
            Dinner?             

09:42.423 --> 09:45.025
    Yes, it's the third meal    
          of the day.           

09:45.059 --> 09:47.177
    We could find somewhere     
         nice and quiet         

09:47.211 --> 09:49.112
where we wouldn't be disturbed. 

09:49.146 --> 09:49.929
      Uh... I don't know.       

09:49.964 --> 09:51.247
You know,                       

09:51.282 --> 09:53.967
         the more time          
you and I spend together,       

09:54.001 --> 09:57.337
      the happier I think       
you'll be with the review.      

09:57.372 --> 09:59.856
  Will you excuse me a minute?  

09:59.890 --> 10:01.924
          I just want           
     to check my schedule.      

10:08.132 --> 10:10.200
             He wants me to have
             dinner with him.   

10:10.234 --> 10:12.035
               That means he    
               <i>expects</i> something

10:12.069 --> 10:13.337
              for a good review.

10:13.371 --> 10:14.938
I'll get the petty cash.        

10:18.993 --> 10:20.210
                        Sam.    

10:20.244 --> 10:22.712
              He wants me to    
              compromise myself.

10:22.746 --> 10:26.149
Honey, we all do.               

10:26.183 --> 10:27.951
                Why do I even   
                talk to you?    

10:27.985 --> 10:29.286
        I'm not going to make   
        a big deal of this.     

10:29.320 --> 10:31.021
        It's just going to be   
        another business dinner.

10:31.055 --> 10:32.355
        That's all.             
        Everything will be fine.

10:32.390 --> 10:33.423
                Listen to me.   
                Listen.         

10:33.457 --> 10:36.042
        If, uh, one thing should
        lead to another tonight 

10:36.077 --> 10:37.160
                 and you wake up
                 in the morning 

10:37.194 --> 10:38.528
              and find out      
              you done something

10:38.562 --> 10:39.562
            you wish you hadn't,

10:39.596 --> 10:40.897
        I just want you to know,

10:40.899 --> 10:43.133
            I'd love to take you
            out tomorrow night. 

10:45.669 --> 10:48.472
So I stand by                   
my original review,             

10:48.506 --> 10:50.907
"the Hungry Heifer              
is a trough."                   

10:50.941 --> 10:51.958
                     Okay, fine.

10:51.993 --> 10:54.160
     But listen, if you can find
     a better 25-ounce steak    

10:54.195 --> 10:55.262
                 for $1.99, pal,

10:55.296 --> 10:56.662
        you just let me know,   
        all right?              

11:00.701 --> 11:02.702
        I'd be happy to have    
        dinner with you tonight.

11:02.736 --> 11:04.271
Great, I'll pick you up         
at 7:00.                        

11:04.305 --> 11:05.305
                    Terrific.   

11:05.339 --> 11:06.672
              I'll see you then,
              Mr. Treadwell.    

11:06.707 --> 11:09.058
Please, call me Murray.         

11:13.096 --> 11:14.514
     All right, all right,      
    sure thing, Eddie.          

11:14.549 --> 11:16.917
  Okay, listen, break a wing.   

11:16.951 --> 11:18.018
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )          

11:18.052 --> 11:20.687
    I know, I know, I know,     
     you hate those jokes.      

11:20.721 --> 11:23.690
    Listen, just keep           
      a stiff upper beak.       

11:23.724 --> 11:24.624
( <i>laughs</i> )                      

11:24.658 --> 11:25.758
I'm sorry.                      

11:25.793 --> 11:27.327
All right, bye-bye,             
bye-bye.                        

11:27.361 --> 11:28.828
Oh, heck.                       

11:28.862 --> 11:31.514
     That was your husband      
on the phone there, Carla.      

11:31.549 --> 11:33.183
Why was he calling you?         

11:33.217 --> 11:34.601
    Well, he's upset.           

11:34.635 --> 11:37.403
    He wanted me to ask you,    
    find out why, you know,     

11:37.438 --> 11:38.905
     you won't go see him.      

11:38.939 --> 11:40.423
How can I, Sam?                 

11:40.458 --> 11:43.326
I can't afford                  
a plane ticket to Seattle.      

11:43.361 --> 11:44.827
    Well, now I could           
      loan you the money.       

11:44.862 --> 11:45.779
    Great.                      

11:45.813 --> 11:48.098
But who could get               
the time off?                   

11:48.132 --> 11:49.265
If it's for the sake            
of your marriage,               

11:49.299 --> 11:50.767
I'm sure we could               
work something out.             

11:50.801 --> 11:52.402
        If you'd like to take   
        a leave of absence      

11:52.437 --> 11:54.103
             for say, a year,   
             that would be fine.

11:54.138 --> 11:56.873
I-I really, I don't know        
why everybody thinks            

11:56.907 --> 11:58.475
I could just                    
pick myself up and go.          

11:58.509 --> 12:00.343
I got two newborn babies.       

12:00.378 --> 12:02.646
Take them.                      
Tykes fly free.                 

12:02.680 --> 12:04.547
          Yeah, usually in the  
          seat right next to me.

12:04.582 --> 12:07.584
Look, I can't go,               
so let's just drop it, okay?    

12:07.618 --> 12:08.618
    Geez.                       

12:08.652 --> 12:10.853
Just came up                    
for a drink order.              

12:10.888 --> 12:14.190
      Carla, Eddie's afraid that
      you're ashamed of him.    

12:14.224 --> 12:16.359
Well, I'm not.                  
                 Well, tell him.
                 Don't tell me. 

12:16.393 --> 12:17.994
    I will!                     

12:18.028 --> 12:20.747
The minute he gets back.        

12:20.781 --> 12:22.699
You're not afraid to fly,       
are you, Carla?                 

12:22.734 --> 12:26.403
Me? Afraid to fly? Me?          

12:26.437 --> 12:30.590
( <i>laughing</i> )                    

12:30.625 --> 12:33.360
          ( <i>cackling</i> )          

12:33.394 --> 12:36.045
     ( <i>maniacal laughter</i> )      

12:36.079 --> 12:38.381
                    ( <i>laughing</i> )

12:38.416 --> 12:40.483
Well, it must be something.     

12:47.975 --> 12:49.559
                    ( <i>laughing</i> )

12:49.594 --> 12:51.895
    I am not afraid to fly.     

12:51.929 --> 12:53.329
            I'm not!            

12:54.215 --> 12:57.067
      I'm afraid to crash.      

12:57.101 --> 12:59.736
            MAN:                
            Did you have        
            a bad experience...?

12:59.770 --> 13:01.104
        Yes, I did!             

13:02.373 --> 13:04.474
First time in an airplane.      

13:04.508 --> 13:07.360
     It was on my honeymoon     
        with Nick.              

13:07.394 --> 13:11.298
We're going to New York--       
short flight, no problem, right?

13:11.332 --> 13:14.667
Well, suddenly, the plane       
hits turbulence, right?         

13:14.701 --> 13:18.071
Me and Nick were thrown         
all around that bathroom.       

13:21.074 --> 13:23.343
I haven't flown since.          

13:23.377 --> 13:24.877
            Sweetheart, that    
            was just one time.  

13:24.912 --> 13:25.812
            I mean, look at me. 

13:25.846 --> 13:27.013
        When I was playing ball,

13:27.047 --> 13:28.548
            I must have flown   
            200,000 miles,      

13:28.582 --> 13:30.583
            and I don't remember
            anything happening. 

13:30.618 --> 13:31.918
'Cause you were                 
always drunk.                   

13:33.253 --> 13:35.789
                Damn right.     

13:35.823 --> 13:37.023
        Good afternoon.         

13:37.057 --> 13:37.807
              Hey.              

13:37.841 --> 13:39.225
Oh, hey, Frasier.               

13:39.259 --> 13:41.261
Yeah. You're just the man       
     I'm looking for here.      

13:41.295 --> 13:42.895
You looking for my camaraderie, 
              Sam,              

13:42.930 --> 13:45.064
      or do you want some       
    free psychiatric advice?    

13:45.098 --> 13:46.416
            Uh... that          
            free thing there.   

13:46.451 --> 13:47.801
             Good.              

13:47.835 --> 13:49.803
                Come on. What do
                you say, Carla? 

13:49.837 --> 13:51.371
    Oh, no way, Sam. Uh-uh.     

13:51.405 --> 13:53.072
I like my head this size.       

13:53.106 --> 13:55.074
  Just keep him away from me.   

13:55.108 --> 13:56.743
                He's the only   
                shrink we know. 

13:56.777 --> 13:59.579
Oh, stop, Sam.                  
You're embarrassing me.         

13:59.613 --> 14:01.347
What's the problem?             

14:01.382 --> 14:03.767
            Well, Carla wants   
            to visit Eddie      
            on the West Coast,  

14:03.801 --> 14:05.434
                but she's       
                afraid to fly.  

14:05.469 --> 14:08.037
Well, do you mean,              
by afraid to fly, what?         

14:08.071 --> 14:11.741
Um... she's claustrophobic,     
agoraphobic, or acrophobic?     

14:11.776 --> 14:13.693
        Death-o-phobic.         

14:13.728 --> 14:15.027
Well, you know, Carla,          

14:15.062 --> 14:16.529
I've done a lot                 
of reading lately               

14:16.564 --> 14:18.030
about fear of flying.           

14:18.065 --> 14:20.099
I've always wanted              
to conduct a workshop           

14:20.133 --> 14:21.934
 for people with your problem.  

14:21.969 --> 14:25.305
I'm sure I could <i>scare up</i>       
     <i>a few people like you.</i>     

14:25.339 --> 14:27.506
Oh, no pun intended.            

14:27.541 --> 14:30.260
    None noticed, I am sure.    

14:30.294 --> 14:31.694
                No way, Frasier.

14:31.728 --> 14:33.696
        I am not going to       
        wind up in your office, 

14:33.730 --> 14:35.031
        strapped to some table  

14:35.065 --> 14:37.033
        with electricity shot   
        through my head.        

14:37.067 --> 14:39.468
    Carla, that's not           
      part of the therapy.      

14:39.503 --> 14:41.470
Oh, yeah? What about Diane?     

14:41.505 --> 14:43.523
            Now, look. I never  
            treated Diane       

14:43.557 --> 14:46.125
            with any kind       
            of shock inducement.

14:46.159 --> 14:48.261
Of course,                      
now I wish I had.               

14:51.482 --> 14:54.050
                No, no. The key 
                to this therapy,

14:54.084 --> 14:57.020
            you see, is, uh...  
            desensitization.    

14:57.054 --> 14:58.254
                Over a period   
                of sessions,    

14:58.289 --> 14:59.722
                we slowly break 
                down your fears 

14:59.756 --> 15:01.357
            until you're ready  
            to get on a plane.  

15:01.391 --> 15:03.894
            And, at the end,    
            we all take         
            an actual flight.   

15:03.928 --> 15:05.695
Yeah? Well,                     
fly this, Orville.              

15:05.729 --> 15:08.664
    ( <i>phone ringing</i> )           

15:08.699 --> 15:09.665
            Cheers.             

15:09.700 --> 15:10.766
             EDDIE:             
        Hey, Sam.               

15:10.801 --> 15:11.968
        Oh, hey, Eddie.         

15:12.002 --> 15:13.152
Long time                       
no hear. Yeah.                  

15:13.186 --> 15:13.987
    How you doing?              

15:14.021 --> 15:15.205
    Oh, the show? It's okay.    

15:15.239 --> 15:17.040
        It's kind               
 of a hockey players' reunion.  

15:17.074 --> 15:18.708
            Listen.             
Did you talk to her, Sam?       

15:18.742 --> 15:20.043
I mean, what did she say?       

15:20.077 --> 15:21.878
No, listen. The problem, Eddie, 

15:21.912 --> 15:23.847
          is not that           
    she's afraid to see you.    

15:23.881 --> 15:25.681
 It's that she's afraid to fly. 

15:25.716 --> 15:27.016
                Carla, afraid?  

15:27.051 --> 15:29.118
            Carla's not afraid  
            of anything, Sam.   

15:29.153 --> 15:30.653
                See, that's     
                just an excuse. 

15:30.687 --> 15:32.288
                I mean, she's   
                ashamed of me.  

15:32.323 --> 15:33.422
                    You know    
                    something?  

15:33.457 --> 15:34.757
                    It's just   
                    not working.

15:34.791 --> 15:36.025
            I'm going to quit.  

15:36.060 --> 15:37.093
No, wait.                       
Hold on. Hold on.               

15:37.127 --> 15:39.095
Listen, he's so sure            
you're ashamed of him           

15:39.129 --> 15:40.113
that he wants to quit.          

15:40.147 --> 15:42.198
                    Really?     
    Yes.                        

15:42.232 --> 15:44.166
            Give me this phone. 

15:44.201 --> 15:45.652
             Eddie?             

15:48.539 --> 15:50.490
     I'm coming to see you.     

15:50.524 --> 15:53.393
 I'll be there in about a week. 

15:53.427 --> 15:54.494
                Really?         
                Aw, gee, Carla. 

15:54.528 --> 15:57.229
        I got the biggest smile 
        you ever saw on my face.

15:57.264 --> 15:58.964
    I wish you could see me.    

16:01.668 --> 16:03.285
                        Eddie?  

16:08.792 --> 16:11.578
Before we take off,             
I'd like to commend you.        

16:11.612 --> 16:13.429
                It's been an    
                intense week,   

16:13.463 --> 16:16.215
but here we are, finally,       
at the end of our journey.      

16:16.250 --> 16:20.420
    Or should I say, perhaps    
    the beginning of the end    

16:20.454 --> 16:23.088
of our journey.                 

16:23.123 --> 16:24.941
I guess                         
we're all set.                  

16:24.975 --> 16:26.826
Let's get this show on the road.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.028
Dr. Crane, uh...                
I... I hope you don't mind.     

16:29.062 --> 16:31.764
I brought along a little        
Saint Christopher's medal.      

16:31.799 --> 16:33.466
         Oh. Well, no.          
If that helps you, that's fine. 

16:33.501 --> 16:34.834
        Oh, great.              

16:35.902 --> 16:37.603
     Anybody else want one?     

16:37.638 --> 16:38.904
        Now, now, Carla.        

16:38.939 --> 16:41.207
    All religious artifacts     
         must be stored         

16:41.241 --> 16:43.476
     either below the seat      
        in front of you         

16:43.510 --> 16:45.144
    or in the overhead bin.     

16:45.179 --> 16:47.279
There, now.                     
Isn't this fun? Huh?            

16:47.314 --> 16:48.481
                        Now...  

16:48.515 --> 16:50.416
    we're going to take off     
    in a few minutes,           

16:50.451 --> 16:52.218
so what should we all be doing? 

16:53.003 --> 16:53.819
            People?             

16:55.205 --> 16:58.908
  Well, we should be focusing   
      on our happy place.

                That place where

17:02.629 --> 17:05.448
     we most like to be...      
where we're most relaxed.       

17:05.482 --> 17:07.317
Can you see it?                 

17:07.351 --> 17:08.984
                Excuse me, sir. 
                We'll be taking 
                off shortly.    

17:09.019 --> 17:10.319
                Would you       
                please sit down?

17:10.354 --> 17:11.887
Oh, yes, of course.             
Just a moment.                  

17:11.922 --> 17:14.156
        All right, now,         
  you're in your happy place.

17:19.814 --> 17:21.580
            Now, just stay      
            in your happy place.

If it's the beach,

                that that sound 

17:25.819 --> 17:28.271
        is the gentle rippling  
        of the water.

                Carla,

happy place?

  On the floor of my stomach,

        with both hands.        

17:34.228 --> 17:35.945

         I've forgotten         
    where my happy place is.    

17:42.253 --> 17:44.370
I think yours                   
was in the Berkshires.          
                Oh, yes.        

17:44.404 --> 17:45.739
                Mine is in      
                the Berkshires. 

17:45.773 --> 17:47.506
Look, everybody can be          
in the Berkshires if they like. 

17:50.060 --> 17:53.712
The Berkshires is an expansive  
and wonderful wooded wonderland.

  So please, sit back, relax.   

18:02.856 --> 18:05.141
Thanks for flying with us.

            for dying with us"? 

18:08.512 --> 18:09.979
    Just relax.                 

18:10.014 --> 18:12.181
I'll be sitting                 
right here beside you.

If you're a little nervous,     
go ahead and grab on to me.

            to the happy ending.

                    Uh-oh!      

18:40.510 --> 18:42.662
We got the Cheers review today. 

18:42.696 --> 18:44.113
    Oh, God! Here it comes.     

18:44.148 --> 18:46.349
 Well, at least you'll all know 

18:46.383 --> 18:48.351
            I didn't            
            compromise myself.  

18:48.386 --> 18:50.353
        And that we probably    
        got a horrendous review 

18:50.388 --> 18:51.855
            and I'll get fired. 

18:51.889 --> 18:54.424
            I can still look at 
            myself in the mirror

18:54.458 --> 18:56.760
            and say, "Would it  
            have killed you?"

  "Hurrah, hurrah for Cheers,   
    the best bar in Boston."

Oh, you slept with him.

    from top to bottom."

The bar or you?                 

19:09.289 --> 19:10.422

                with him.

Oh, stop it. I think            
I respect you more              
now than I ever did.

                a filthy mind.  

19:16.263 --> 19:18.931
            Nobody else in      
            here thinks that,   
            so just shut up.

I was a pilot                   
for this airline.

to me that                      

20:51.375 --> 20:53.843

in the hands                    
of someone like me.

  if we get hit by lightning?

      we're all just going

                        No.     
    My God!                     

22:24.985 --> 22:26.703
There's a leak                  
in the fuselage!                

22:26.737 --> 22:28.037
            Calm down, Frasier. 

22:28.072 --> 22:30.272
Oh, God, look!                  
It's the wings!                 

22:30.307 --> 22:31.407
                They're flapping

22:31.442 --> 22:32.624
around like                     
a wounded duck!                 

22:32.659 --> 22:33.692
We're all gonna die!            

22:33.727 --> 22:35.728
                Frasier! You're 
                not in your     
                happy place.    

22:35.762 --> 22:37.263
What do you mean?               
In a grave?                     

22:37.297 --> 22:38.264
We're going down!               

22:38.298 --> 22:39.114
            We're going down!   

22:39.149 --> 22:40.583
I got to get out of here!       

22:40.617 --> 22:41.367
             Mommy!             

22:41.402 --> 22:42.368
             Mommy!             

22:42.402 --> 22:43.819
                Frasier!        

22:48.075 --> 22:49.325
Honest, Eddie.                  

22:49.359 --> 22:51.927
I'm flying out                  
tomorrow night. Yeah.           

22:51.962 --> 22:54.564
Frasier's class taught me       
    how stupid it was           

22:54.598 --> 22:56.732
    to be afraid of flying.     

22:56.766 --> 22:59.034
          Oh, me, too.          

22:59.069 --> 23:00.970
 I can't wait to get you alone, 

23:01.004 --> 23:06.008
 strip you out of that penguin  
 outfit, and climb all over ya. 

23:06.042 --> 23:10.179
      We're sharing a room      
  with the three little pigs?   

23:10.214 --> 23:14.683
    Well, they're used          
    to huffing and puffing.     

23:14.718 --> 23:17.386
    All right. See you then.    

23:17.421 --> 23:18.838
Sam, you don't                  
really think Miss Howe          

23:18.872 --> 23:21.674
would do anything she           
shouldn't have to get           
a good review, do you?          

23:21.708 --> 23:24.109
            No, Of course not.  
Then why do you                 
keep teasing her?               

23:24.143 --> 23:25.878
                Well, haven't   
                you ever noticed

23:25.913 --> 23:28.881
            how her chest       
            kind of heaves      
            when she's angry?   

23:28.916 --> 23:31.800
I always avert my eyes.         

23:33.587 --> 23:35.721
            You're kidding me.  
    No.                         

23:35.756 --> 23:38.474
    I'm a leg man.              

23:41.728 --> 23:43.212
                Excuse me, miss?

23:43.246 --> 23:46.148
            I couldn't help     
            but overhear        
            your conversation.  

23:46.183 --> 23:48.418
            I've had a fear     
            of flying for years,

23:48.452 --> 23:51.137
        and I think it's time   
        that I confronted it.   

23:51.171 --> 23:52.789
                How can I get   
                into that class 

23:52.823 --> 23:54.524
            that worked         
            miracles for you?   

23:54.558 --> 23:55.858
I can do                        
better than that.               

23:55.893 --> 23:58.361
The doctor's over               
there. Hey, Fras?               

23:58.395 --> 24:00.746
     I'm in my happy place.     

24:02.732 --> 24:04.800
                Sign up early.
