01:19.514 --> 01:21.255
CUT! CUT!

01:21.298 --> 01:24.040
CUT. FINKLE!

01:24.084 --> 01:25.476
RIGHT HERE.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.261
WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT SNEAKING UP ON ME?

01:27.304 --> 01:28.305
DON'T DO IT!

01:30.612 --> 01:32.918
TELL ME WHY THE BLOOD
FROM MAXINE'S PROSTHETIC

01:32.962 --> 01:34.268
LOOKS LIKE AN OLD GUY PISSING.

01:34.311 --> 01:37.880
STOP STARING AT ME
AND GET IT FIXED.

01:37.923 --> 01:39.229
-NOW!
-I'M ON IT. I'M ON IT.

01:39.273 --> 01:40.796
-ANDRE!
-GODDAMN IT.

01:40.839 --> 01:43.277
-ANDRE!
-HONEY.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.800
YOU NEED A TIGHTER
OUTFIT, OKAY?

01:44.843 --> 01:46.541
MAYBE PUSH UP YOUR BRA A BIT,

01:46.584 --> 01:47.890
WORK ON YOUR CLEAVAGE
WITH WARDROBE.

01:47.933 --> 01:50.414
IT GIVES THE AUDIENCE
A FOCAL POINT,

01:50.458 --> 01:52.460
INSTANT EMPATHY
WITH YOUR CHARACTER.

01:52.503 --> 01:54.723
OKAY. ANY OTHER NOTES?

01:54.766 --> 01:56.855
NO. FINKLE!

02:01.121 --> 02:02.861
I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU

02:02.905 --> 02:05.168
THAT WORKING FOR YOU THESE PAST
FEW WEEKS HAVE BEEN--

02:05.212 --> 02:06.865
SAVE IT, SAVE IT.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.477
JUST GET EVERYONE
INTO POSITION FOR ME.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.219
AND LET'S GET THIS NIGHTMARE
OVER WITH.

02:12.262 --> 02:14.221
FIRST POSITIONS!

02:29.758 --> 02:31.803
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON
YOUR LOCAL WEATHER IN A MINUTE.

02:31.847 --> 02:34.980
IN ENTERTAINMENT NEWS,
HORROR CULT CLASSIC DIRECTOR

02:35.024 --> 02:38.549
SPENCER CROWE, BETTER KNOWN
FOR SUCH HITS AS "DEATH BITCH"

02:38.593 --> 02:41.204
AND "BLOOD TEARS,"
IS BACK IN REHAB AGAIN

02:41.248 --> 02:44.207
AFTER BEING STOPPED BY OFFICERS
ON PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY

02:44.251 --> 02:45.687
FOR DRUNK DRIVING.

02:45.730 --> 02:48.472
THIS IS HIS THIRD D.U.I.
IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS.

02:48.516 --> 02:51.388
WE WISH HIM A QUICK
AND CONSISTENT RECOVERY...

03:19.808 --> 03:22.332
911, WHAT'S THE NATURE
OF YOUR EMERGENCY?

03:22.376 --> 03:25.770
UH, I THINK I-- I THINK I JUST
HEARD SHOTS BEING FIRED,

03:25.814 --> 03:28.512
UH, DOWN THE BLOCK.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.688
COVER THAT WINDOW RIGHT THERE.
COVER THIS WINDOW.

03:30.732 --> 03:34.126
ALL RIGHT? ON ME.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.478
DROP IT! DROP IT!

04:11.773 --> 04:13.949
JUDGE, THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE
IN THERE.

04:13.992 --> 04:16.038
I TRIED TO WARN THEM.

04:16.081 --> 04:17.779
I TRIED TO SAVE THEM.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.084
ORDER.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.315
THE STATE HEREBY SENTENCES YOU
TO A MAXIMUM SECURITY

04:32.359 --> 04:34.274
-MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY.
-NO, PLEASE.

04:34.317 --> 04:35.536
THERE WAS A MONSTER IN THERE.

04:35.579 --> 04:37.407
YOU HAVE TO--
I TRIED TO WARN THEM

04:37.451 --> 04:39.888
AND I COULDN'T SAVE THEM.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.368
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME,
PLEASE!

04:41.411 --> 04:42.673
I TRIED TO WARN THEM

04:42.717 --> 04:43.979
AND I TRIED TO SAVE THEM!

04:44.022 --> 04:45.372
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME...

04:45.415 --> 04:47.983
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.
THESE POLLS ARE SHIT.

04:48.026 --> 04:49.680
SO WE'RE IN A DOWN SPIRAL,

04:49.724 --> 04:50.855
A DOWN TREND.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.117
DOWNTURN.

04:52.161 --> 04:54.206
YES, THAT.

04:54.250 --> 04:57.688
I'M SUGGESTING SOME SORT OF
ECONOMIC INFUSION, YOU KNOW?

04:57.732 --> 05:00.517
SOMETHING THAT GALVANIZES
THE COMMUNITY AROUND YOU
COME ELECTION TIME.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.824
SIR?

05:02.867 --> 05:04.565
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT MAN?

05:04.608 --> 05:06.044
LOVED HIS EARLY WORK.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.307
YEAH, HE GOT EATEN UP.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.352
HOLLYWOOD'S A TOUGH TOWN.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.920
WHAT'S THAT THING THEY DO
THIS TIME OF YEAR

05:11.963 --> 05:14.749
IN ALL THOSE CRAZY HOUSES,
ABANDONED HOTELS?

05:14.792 --> 05:17.795
LIKE A FREAK SHOW?

05:17.839 --> 05:20.581
KIDS LOVE IT. YOU GET
A BUNCH OF ACTORS TOGETHER,

05:20.624 --> 05:22.452
DRESS LIKE CRAZIES,
CHASING FOLKS, CHAINSAWS.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.324
OH, LIKE A FRIGHT FEST.

05:24.367 --> 05:28.328
WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
IN THE ASYLUM?

05:28.371 --> 05:30.112
GIVE FOLKS SOMETHING
TO LOOK FORWARD TO?

05:31.548 --> 05:34.159
THE STATE ASYLUM?

05:34.203 --> 05:38.076
-IT'S ABANDONED.
-DAMN STRAIGHT IT IS.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.427
AND IF IT'S A SUCCESS,

05:40.470 --> 05:42.342
WE'RE BACK IN OFFICE.

05:42.385 --> 05:44.735
I LOVE THIS IDEA.

05:44.779 --> 05:48.130
A REPURPOSED ECONOMIC BOON.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.871
BUT HOW ARE WE
PULLING IT OFF EXACTLY?

05:49.914 --> 05:51.873
THAT.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.178
...WITH NO END IN SIGHT

05:53.222 --> 05:54.745
TO HIS LEGAL
AND PERSONAL PROBLEMS.

05:54.789 --> 05:57.052
THAT'S OUR MAN.

06:01.665 --> 06:03.058
I'M DOING WHAT?

06:03.101 --> 06:05.800
LOOK, I'M MORE THAN
YOUR ATTORNEY HERE, MAN.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.541
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

06:07.584 --> 06:08.759
AND THIS IS THE BEST THING
FOR EVERYONE.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.370
IF YOU WIN, I WIN.

06:10.413 --> 06:11.893
YOU ALWAYS WIN.

06:11.936 --> 06:14.112
YOU GET PAID
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS.

06:14.156 --> 06:17.377
SPENCER, YOU HAVEN'T
PAID ME IN TWO YEARS.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.161
AND YOU HAVEN'T HAD
A PAYING GIG IN AT LEAST FOUR.

06:19.204 --> 06:22.207
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

06:22.251 --> 06:25.254
THAT MIGHT BE TRUE.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.647
WHERE'S THIS PLACE AGAIN?

06:26.690 --> 06:29.345
SOMMERTON. SMALL TOWN,
MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.303
AND AS FAR AS THE LOCALS
ARE CONCERNED, YOU'RE A GOD,

06:31.347 --> 06:32.348
A LIVING LEGEND.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.176
WHAT ARE THEY PAYING?

06:34.219 --> 06:38.006
NOT A WHOLE LOT
AFTER I GET MY CUT,

06:38.049 --> 06:40.269
MINUS THE MARGINAL
EXPENSES YOU OWE.

06:40.312 --> 06:43.707
BUT IT GETS YOU
OUT OF DOING A FEW MONTHS
OF ROADSIDE CLEANUP.

06:43.751 --> 06:46.493
I PULLED A LOT OF STRINGS
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.192
IT'S LIVE HORROR?

06:50.235 --> 06:52.194
A FRIGHT FEST.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.717
I'VE NEVER DONE A FRIGHT FEST.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.589
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE FUCK
A FRIGHT FEST IS.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.112
YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T NEED
TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.288
YOU'RE THE KING OF HORROR.

06:59.331 --> 07:02.204
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.
IF YOU GET THIS HALF RIGHT,
IT GOES NATIONAL.

07:02.247 --> 07:04.206
AS IN FRIGHT FEST
FROM COAST TO COAST

07:04.249 --> 07:06.861
PRESENTED BY THE MASTER
OF HORROR, SPENCER CROWE.

07:06.904 --> 07:09.385
THIS COULD BE THE COMEBACK
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.521
OKAY, I THINK I LIKE IT.

07:17.872 --> 07:21.049
AND I THINK I LIKE WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH IT, TOO.

07:21.092 --> 07:23.051
PERFECT...

07:23.094 --> 07:25.357
BECAUSE YOU LEAVE TOMORROW.

07:25.401 --> 07:28.360
MAYOR FOWLER IS VERY EXCITED

07:28.404 --> 07:31.363
TO SHARE HIS NEW FISCAL PLAN
IN LISTING THE TALENTS

07:31.407 --> 07:34.976
AND ECONOMIC BENEFIT
OF OUR AMAZING COMMUNITY.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.108
MAYOR FOWLER.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.550
I'M MORE THAN THRILLED
TO ANNOUNCE

07:43.593 --> 07:46.944
A MUCH NEEDED BOON
TO THIS REGION,

07:46.988 --> 07:52.080
ONE THAT PUTS US ON THE MAP
AS A YEARLY DESTINATION.

07:52.123 --> 07:54.865
A FRIGHT FEST
IN THE ONCE-CLOSED,

07:54.909 --> 07:57.346
NOW REOPENED STATE ASYLUM.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.788
BUT WHAT MAKES THIS
MORE SPECIAL

08:04.832 --> 08:08.009
IS WHO WE HAVE CREATING IT.

08:08.052 --> 08:12.883
A FIRST-RATE
HOLLYWOOD HORROR FILM GURU

08:12.927 --> 08:16.539
RIGHT HERE
IN OUR VERY OWN BACKYARD.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.523
ALL RIGHT, SO I'M CONFUSED.

08:43.566 --> 08:46.700
ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
MARY POPPINS OR SOMETHING?

08:46.743 --> 08:48.353
MORE LIKE LIZZIE BORDEN.

08:48.397 --> 08:49.920
WHO IS LIZZIE BORDEN?

08:49.964 --> 08:51.226
THREE WEEKS REHEARSING,

08:51.269 --> 08:52.575
BUT THE JOKES
KEEP GETTING BETTER.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.577
KINDA LIKE THIS?

08:54.621 --> 08:58.886
AHH, MY BEAUTIFUL, YOUNG,
HOT, TIGHT THESPS.

08:58.929 --> 09:00.148
WASN'T MEANT FOR YOU, RICO.

09:00.191 --> 09:02.237
I KIND OF FIGURED THAT.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.152
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

09:04.195 --> 09:06.589
-I THINK YOU'RE HANDSOME.
-SHUT UP, FINKLE,

09:06.633 --> 09:08.678
AND LET'S START THIS
LAME-ASS TOUR.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.071
HEY, SPENCE,

09:10.114 --> 09:11.551
YOU THINK YOU COULD
GET WARDROBE

09:11.594 --> 09:13.596
TO MAKE THESE SPANDEX
A LITTLE TIGHTER?

09:13.640 --> 09:16.120
I WANT THIS PSYCHO KILLER
TO REALLY STAND OUT.

09:16.164 --> 09:17.948
THINK SO.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.690
MIGHT HAVE TO CHECK YOU OUT
WITH MY TALENT METER FIRST.

09:22.257 --> 09:25.565
OKAY, WITH THAT BEING SAID,

09:25.608 --> 09:27.697
IS IT TRUE
THAT ON "DEATH BITCH,"

09:27.741 --> 09:30.918
YOU USED A REAL LOADED GUN
TO HELP MOTIVATE YOUR ACTORS?

09:30.961 --> 09:33.050
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.878
AND FOR LEGAL PURPOSES,

09:34.922 --> 09:36.532
I CAN'T REALLY ANSWER THAT.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.490
IS EVERYONE HERE?

09:40.797 --> 09:43.104
BASTARD!

09:43.147 --> 09:45.976
ALWAYS BE PREPARED
FOR THE UNEXPECTED.

09:46.020 --> 09:49.632
-THAT'S HORROR.
-WHERE'S STEPH?

09:49.676 --> 09:51.373
CAN YOU PLEASE MAKE SURE
EVERYONE IS HERE?

09:51.416 --> 09:52.896
I DON'T WANNA HAVE TO
REPEAT MYSELF!

09:52.940 --> 09:56.204
CHILL. I WAS LISTENING.

09:56.247 --> 09:57.553
JUST CATCHING SOME Z'S
ON THE COT.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.817
OH, YOU GOT
AN OVERCONFIDENT WALK.

10:00.861 --> 10:01.905
HIP DYSPLASIA?

10:01.949 --> 10:03.559
WHAT?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.213
-SMART, TOO.
-THANK YOU.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.780
FOR GRACING US.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.433
YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:08.477 --> 10:10.174
I'D SAY "BITE ME,"
BUT YOU WOULD.

10:10.218 --> 10:13.787
FUNNY. SHOW UP ON TIME.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.920
GUYS, YOU'RE RUINING
MY AFTERNOON BUZZ.

10:16.964 --> 10:21.359
ALL RIGHT,
THE PAIN-IN-THE-ASS MAYOR

10:21.403 --> 10:23.927
SAYS IT'S MANDATORY
WE TAKE THIS GUIDED TOUR.

10:23.971 --> 10:26.277
I KNOW. I'VE BEEN PUTTING IT OFF
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.628
IT'S GOTTA GET DONE.
FINKLE, LEAD THE WAY.

10:28.671 --> 10:31.631
COME ON, COME ON.

10:31.674 --> 10:32.849
GATE OPENS AT 7:00.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.111
WE'LL BE GOING TO 2:00 A.M.

10:34.155 --> 10:35.635
AFTER THAT,

10:35.678 --> 10:37.419
I WILL BE IN THE NEAREST BAR.

10:37.462 --> 10:40.552
PLEASE DON'T ASK ME
ANY QUESTIONS.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.946
YOU SHOULD ALL KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING BY NOW.

10:42.990 --> 10:45.819
FINK. YOU CAN HANDLE
THE REST FOR ME, RIGHT?

10:45.862 --> 10:47.255
YEAH, OF COURSE, SPENCE,
YOU KNOW.

10:47.298 --> 10:48.822
I'LL BE IN THE CONTROL ROOM.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.084
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.912
COPY THAT.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.044
GUYS?

10:56.438 --> 10:59.093
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

10:59.136 --> 11:00.094
TAILORED.

11:00.137 --> 11:03.053
AIN'T THAT RIGHT.

11:03.097 --> 11:04.838
THEY'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

11:04.881 --> 11:08.276
FINEST POLITICAL MIND
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.278
-PHILIP?
-YEAH.

11:10.321 --> 11:13.803
STOP KISSING MY ASS
AND JUST GET US REELECTED.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.109
OKAY.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.962
OOH!

11:42.005 --> 11:44.138
THIS SHIT GOES ON
FOREVER, MAN.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.661
LANGUAGE, RICO.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.055
LET'S KEEP IT AT A MINIMUM.

11:48.098 --> 11:49.926
I'M SORRY, MAN, OKAY?

11:51.928 --> 11:53.887
WHAT THE--
LOOK AT ALL THIS!

11:53.930 --> 11:55.671
THIS SHIT REALLY
GO ON FOREVER, MAN!

11:55.715 --> 11:57.238
LOOK AT THIS!

11:57.281 --> 12:00.763
IT WASN'T MY IDEA TO MIX
IN THE ASYLUM'S PAST

12:00.807 --> 12:02.678
WITH CHARACTERS
FROM OUR HIT FILMS.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.332
- OH.
- "OUR HIT FILMS"?

12:04.375 --> 12:05.942
YOU'RE A PRODUCTION
ASSISTANT, KID.

12:05.986 --> 12:08.075
YEAH, WE IMDB'ED YOUR ASS.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.294
I WAS PART OF THE T-E-A-M.

12:10.338 --> 12:13.384
-OH, MY...
-SO LET'S START
BEING TEAM MEMBERS, OKAY?

12:13.428 --> 12:15.691
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?
I WAS PART OF THE T-E-A-M.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.171
LET'S GO, TEAM!

12:17.214 --> 12:18.476
-OH, COME ON.
-SHUT UP, RICO.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.088
YOU GUYS THINK
IT'S REALLY HAUNTED?

12:22.654 --> 12:24.569
OH, MY GOD, YOU SCARED
THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

12:24.613 --> 12:27.137
GREAT COSTUME, LADY.
WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO BE?

12:28.791 --> 12:32.186
THIS IS ESTELLE PARSONS
FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BOARD

12:32.229 --> 12:33.883
AND HISTORICAL COMMITTEE.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.406
SHE'S OUR TOUR GUIDE.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.539
THANK YOU, FINKLE.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.106
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU ALL.

12:39.149 --> 12:41.456
AS YOU'LL BE REPRESENTING
THIS FAMED ASYLUM,

12:41.499 --> 12:45.590
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR

12:45.634 --> 12:48.419
WITH ITS HISTORY.

12:52.336 --> 12:53.337
EXCITING, HUH?

13:33.421 --> 13:36.337
WE SHOULD RESPECT THE SPIRITS
THAT ARE STILL HERE.

13:36.380 --> 13:38.121
LIKE CROWE DOES?

13:38.165 --> 13:41.124
LITTLE JACK DANIEL'S,
SOUTHERN COMFORT.

13:41.168 --> 13:43.387
IS IT JUST ME OR IS THIS PLACE
BORING OR WHAT?

13:45.737 --> 13:47.130
SHE IS WEIRD ENOUGH.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.437
UGH!

13:56.139 --> 13:58.750
BEEN SHOT AT TOO MANY TIMES
FOR SHIT LIKE THIS.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.883
BIGGEST PUSSY I EVER MET, BRO.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.972
HOW DID YOU EVEN GET THIS GIG?

14:03.016 --> 14:06.671
HEY, SHOULDN'T WE BE GETTING
INTO HAIR AND MAKEUP
AND WARDROBE SOON?

14:06.715 --> 14:07.716
YOU DONE YET?

14:07.759 --> 14:09.674

14:09.718 --> 14:11.502
EL DIRECTOR HEARS ALL, HUH?

14:11.546 --> 14:12.982
AND SEES ALL.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.027
COME ON!

14:22.122 --> 14:24.037
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

14:27.431 --> 14:30.260
WE'RE GOING FOR A RIDE.

14:30.304 --> 14:33.698
WE'RE GOING FOR A RIDE.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.136
WE'RE GOING FOR A RIDE.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.268
OKAY, LISTEN UP,
YOU SICK PSYCHO BASTARDS.

14:38.312 --> 14:41.315
YOU'VE ALL BEEN CONVICTED
OF SOME REALLY SICK SHIT.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.925
BUT I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS
FOR YOU,

14:42.969 --> 14:45.058
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

14:45.101 --> 14:48.235
SO YOU DO THIS TRANSFER
WITHOUT INCIDENT

14:48.278 --> 14:51.151
AND I'LL MAKE SURE YOU ALL
GET SOME EXTRA MEDS

14:51.194 --> 14:53.414
WHEN WE GET TO THE FACILITY.

14:53.457 --> 14:58.027
HEAVY MEDS AND ELECTRICITY.

14:58.071 --> 15:01.509
THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTLESS
ACCOUNTS OF RESTLESS SPIRITS

15:01.552 --> 15:03.511
WANDERING AIMLESSLY.

15:03.554 --> 15:06.514
BUT HERE,

15:06.557 --> 15:09.560
RIGHT HERE IN THIS VERY SPOT

15:09.604 --> 15:14.174
IS WHERE THE LEAD PSYCHIATRIST
AND HIS WIFE DIED.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.392
YOU MEAN LIKE RIGHT HERE?

15:15.436 --> 15:17.481
MM.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.614
IT'S RUMORED THEY PLACED
THEIR FIRST-BORN CHILD

15:19.657 --> 15:21.224
INTO TREATMENT HERE,

15:21.268 --> 15:24.532
CONFINED HIM TO AN ISOLATED
SPACE IN THE BASEMENT

15:24.575 --> 15:27.143
DUE TO HIS
MURDEROUS TENDENCIES--

15:27.187 --> 15:32.322
AN INNATE PROCLIVITY
FOR KILLING THINGS.

15:32.366 --> 15:35.151
WHEN THE PSYCHIATRIST'S WIFE
BECAME PREGNANT

15:35.195 --> 15:36.674
MANY YEARS LATER,

15:36.718 --> 15:40.330
HE MADE HER GIVE
THAT CHILD UP FOR ADOPTION.

15:40.374 --> 15:43.986
SHE NEVER FORGAVE HIM.

15:44.030 --> 15:47.729
SO SHE KILLED HIM
AND THEN HERSELF.

15:47.772 --> 15:51.167
BUT IT'S SAID
THAT EVERY HALLOWEEN

15:51.211 --> 15:54.779
SHE CALLS OUT TO HER CHILDREN,

15:54.823 --> 15:57.913
CALLING THEM TO RETURN HOME.

15:57.957 --> 15:58.958
HMM.

16:06.530 --> 16:09.185
IS IT ME
OR IS THIS BORING AS HELL?

16:11.013 --> 16:14.321
WE'RE RIGHT BENEATH
THE CENTRAL SPIRE OF THE ASYLUM,

16:14.364 --> 16:18.978
THE HEART OF THE SUPERNATURAL,
SO TO SPEAK.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.504
YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR
THE SCREAMS OF A TORTURED

16:23.547 --> 16:27.812
INSTITUTIONALIZED SOUL.

16:27.856 --> 16:30.380
THIS CONCLUDES THE TOUR.

16:30.424 --> 16:33.253
LOOK, I'M NOT WITH ALL THIS
CREEPY SHIT, ALL RIGHT?

16:33.296 --> 16:35.995
LIKE, I WAS DOWN
BEFORE THE TOUR.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.561
LIKE, ARE Y'ALL TRYING TO
MAKE US QUIT OR SOMETHING?

16:37.605 --> 16:38.998
HEY, LITTLE BITCH.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.912
I HATE THIS SHIT!

16:40.956 --> 16:44.003
YEAH, TO HELL
WITH THIS TOUR BULLSHIT.

16:44.046 --> 16:46.135
THERE YOU GO, CONGRATS.
YOU DIDN'T GET THE LEAD.

16:46.179 --> 16:47.354
-HEY.
-JUST MAKE SURE

16:47.397 --> 16:49.878
YOU'RE ALL AS GOOD
AS ESTELLE HERE.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.054
COME ON, THE WOMAN KNOWS
THE PLACE ASS-BACKWARDS.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.230
ESTELLE WAS HIRED
TO GIVE YOU THE TOUR,

16:54.274 --> 16:57.016
BUT MORE TO MOTIVATE
YOUR BELIEVABILITY.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.800
FOUND HER ON BACKPAGE,
ADULT SECTION,

16:58.843 --> 17:02.630
ONE OF MANY PLANTS
I'VE SET UP FOR TONIGHT.

17:02.673 --> 17:05.241
ANYBODY NEED
A TANTRIC MASSAGE, HUH?

17:05.285 --> 17:07.461
-I KNEW SHE LOOKED
FAMILIAR, BRO.
-OH, MY GOD.

17:07.503 --> 17:08.853
SO, LOOK,
I WAS LITERALLY ON BACKPAGE

17:08.896 --> 17:10.333
LOOKING FOR A LITTLE
G.F.E. DEAL.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.335
I'M NOT REALLY THAT FREAKY,

17:12.378 --> 17:14.816
BUT YOU INTO BDSM,
THAT'S YOUR GUY.

17:14.858 --> 17:16.599
WHAT'S BDSM?

17:16.644 --> 17:17.732
BDSM, IT MEANS BONDAGE--

17:17.775 --> 17:19.603
OKAY, SHUT UP. SHUT UP.

17:19.646 --> 17:20.778
EVERYTHING ESTELLE TOLD YOU

17:20.821 --> 17:22.345
WAS IN YOUR WELCOME PACKETS.

17:22.388 --> 17:24.130
NO ONE READ 'EM. WHO CARES?

17:24.173 --> 17:25.608
POINT IS, SHE'S CONVINCING.

17:25.653 --> 17:28.176
AS CONVINCING AS YOU ALL
NEED TO BE SO I CAN KEEP

17:28.221 --> 17:31.702
A GOOD BUZZ GOING ALL NIGHT
WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.

17:31.746 --> 17:33.052
I DON'T GET IT.

17:33.095 --> 17:34.575
WHAT? GET WHAT?

17:34.618 --> 17:36.664
IF ESTELLE'S FROM BACKPAGE,

17:36.707 --> 17:39.101
HOW DOES SHE KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT THE ASYLUM?

17:39.145 --> 17:41.408
READ WIKIPEDIA.

17:41.451 --> 17:43.714
ALSO, I'M NOT PROUD OF THIS,

17:43.758 --> 17:48.110
BUT I SPENT A LITTLE TIME HERE
BEFORE IT CLOSED.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.633
WHOO.

17:49.677 --> 17:52.114
YOU HIRED
A CERTIFIABLE PERSON?

17:52.158 --> 17:53.724
PLEASE TELL ME SHE'S NOT

17:53.768 --> 17:55.422
-GONNA BE PERFORMING.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.206
NO, NO, NO, NOT HERE.
ESTELLE?

17:57.250 --> 17:58.468
OKAY.

17:58.512 --> 18:00.601
THANKS FOR COMING.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.778

18:05.519 --> 18:07.129
FINKLE. HMM!

18:07.173 --> 18:09.262
I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.046
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.874
I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS,
SPENCER.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.104
HEY, UM...

18:25.147 --> 18:26.583

18:26.627 --> 18:28.281
YOU WANNA MAKE A QUICK 20?

18:28.324 --> 18:30.239
$20?

18:30.283 --> 18:32.720
WHAT, ARE WE IN THE '80S?

18:32.763 --> 18:34.809
I'M NOT MAKING MY USUAL RATE
ON THIS ONE.

18:55.177 --> 18:58.528
IF I DIDN'T LIKE YOU,
I WOULDN'T BE DOING THIS.

19:08.190 --> 19:11.889
THAT'S GREAT, THAT'S GREAT.
PERFECT.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.761
BLOOD ALCOHOL 0.0.

19:13.804 --> 19:14.849
OH, WOW.

19:14.892 --> 19:16.198
THAT WAS QUICK.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.895
IGNITION ALLOWED.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.419
THANKS FOR BLOWING.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.641
WANNA MAKE ANOTHER 20?

19:26.382 --> 19:28.210
WORTH A SHOT.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.211
HEY, DO ME A SOLID,

19:29.255 --> 19:31.213
CHECK MY BACK RIGHT TIRE.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.346
I THINK IT'S LOW.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.530
HMM.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.706
I DON'T KNOW.
IT LOOKS LIKE--

22:36.616 --> 22:39.793

22:39.836 --> 22:41.403
WHY DO I HELP YOU
DO THIS TO YOURSELF?

22:41.447 --> 22:43.753
'CAUSE IT'S YOUR JOB.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.755
WHERE WOULD YOU BE

22:45.799 --> 22:48.018
CAN YOU GET ONE OF THOSE
BEERS OUT FOR ME?

22:48.062 --> 22:49.846
- FUCK YOURSELF.

23:25.621 --> 23:27.188

23:38.634 --> 23:40.593
JUST WANTED TO HAVE
A QUICK WORD.

23:40.636 --> 23:41.985
SO NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.378

GET A REAL KICK OUT OF IT.

23:54.215 --> 23:55.390
IT'LL LOOK REAL.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.523
OH, THE SHOCK THERAPY ROOM
IS READY

23:57.566 --> 23:59.742

I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.444

24:09.535 --> 24:11.406
WELL, SOMETHING HAS TO PROCEED.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.060
MIGHT AS WELL BE REPUTATION.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.454
YES.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.587
AS A LECHEROUS, SKIRT-CHASING,
DEGENERATE GAMBLER,

24:18.631 --> 24:21.242
DEADBEAT DAD, AND DRUG ADDICT.

24:23.418 --> 24:26.508

I THOUGHT YOU WERE...

35:26.211 --> 35:27.516
EXCUSE ME?

35:27.560 --> 35:29.692
DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE

35:29.736 --> 35:32.739
LOOK, SPENCER, I GOT A LOT
GOING ON OUT THERE.

35:32.782 --> 35:34.610

38:42.755 --> 38:44.452
DISTURBING.

38:44.496 --> 38:46.889

39:13.525 --> 39:15.004
IT WAS DARK.

39:15.048 --> 39:17.485
PEOPLE COULDN'T REALLY SEE
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

39:17.529 --> 39:20.445
I CAN CONTAIN THIS.
WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

39:20.488 --> 39:23.535
NOW, LET'S GET YOU READY

39:51.780 --> 39:53.260
EVERYBODY HAS TO STAY
INSIDE OF THE ASYLUM

39:53.303 --> 39:54.304
FOR THE DURATION OF THE NIGHT.

39:56.306 --> 39:57.960

41:03.896 --> 41:06.725
WE DON'T WANT TO BE CONFINED
TO OURSELVES, NOW DO WE?

41:13.253 --> 41:15.168

42:23.497 --> 42:26.152
I'M INNOCENT.
YOU HAVE THE WRONG MAN.

42:26.195 --> 42:28.371
I'M INNOCENT.

42:28.415 --> 42:30.069
THIS TOWN'S FALLING APART
BECAUSE OF YOU.

42:30.112 --> 42:34.639
ELECTROSHOCK THERAPY

OH, GROSS.

44:59.914 --> 45:01.524
IS THIS THE WAY TO THE EXIT?

45:01.568 --> 45:02.830
NO, IT WAS BACK THE OTHER WAY!

45:02.874 --> 45:04.136
JUST FOLLOW ME.

45:18.324 --> 45:20.195
WHO'S THAT?

45:23.546 --> 45:26.898

45:58.320 --> 45:59.713
YOU NEED TO OPEN THE DOOR

45:59.757 --> 46:01.671
-SO WE CAN CALL THE POLICE!
-NO POLICE!

46:01.715 --> 46:03.195
I GOT TOO MUCH

48:57.412 --> 48:59.197
YOU REALLY THINK IT'S SAFE
SPLITTING UP LIKE THIS?

48:59.240 --> 49:02.200
NO, BUT YOU GOT
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

53:51.053 --> 53:52.838
I GOTTA GO SEE
IF I CAN FIND ANY SUPPLIES.

53:52.881 --> 53:54.622
NO, NO. YOU STAY HERE
WITH ME, OKAY?

53:54.666 --> 53:57.408
WE'RE SAFER--
WE'RE SAFER TOGETHER.

53:57.451 --> 53:58.626
I'M JUST GOING THROUGH
THOSE SWINGING DOORS, OKAY?

53:58.670 --> 54:02.064
YOU ARE LOSING A LOT OF BLOOD.

54:02.108 --> 54:05.198
JUST STAY HERE, OKAY?

54:40.277 --> 54:41.974
LOOK, IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

54:42.017 --> 54:43.236
IT'S ME.
IT'S ME, ALL RIGHT?

54:49.329 --> 54:50.287
WHAT ARE THOSE?

54:50.330 --> 54:51.940
I FOUND THEM INSIDE.

54:51.984 --> 54:53.725
WHAT ARE THESE?

54:53.768 --> 54:55.161
I FOUND THEM INSIDE.

54:55.204 --> 54:57.250
ARE THESE YOURS?

54:57.294 --> 54:58.730
ARE THESE PRESCRIBED TO YOU?

54:58.773 --> 55:01.472
DON'T JUDGE ME, OKAY?

55:01.515 --> 55:03.125
AH, IT BURNS!

55:03.169 --> 55:06.085
I'M SORRY. SHH!

55:06.128 --> 55:07.869
OKAY, OKAY.

55:16.400 --> 55:18.184
OKAY, WE GOTTA GO.

55:18.227 --> 55:19.838
YOU THINK YOU CAN GET UP?

55:19.881 --> 55:21.230
ALL RIGHT.

55:41.773 --> 55:44.863
SHH. SHUT UP
OR HE'LL COME BACK.

55:47.779 --> 55:49.215
SHH.

55:50.564 --> 55:52.392
WHO ARE YOU?

55:52.436 --> 55:56.178
HE WAS GONNA KILL YOU.
I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE.

55:56.222 --> 55:58.180
OH, MY GOD.

55:58.224 --> 55:59.530
YOU'RE THE PSYCHO
FROM THE NEWS!

55:59.573 --> 56:01.140
-NO, NO! SHH, SHH!
-I'M GONNA DIE!

56:01.183 --> 56:02.141
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME!

56:02.184 --> 56:03.751
I WAS THERE, I WAS THERE.

56:03.795 --> 56:06.145
I WAS THERE.
I WAS THERE, BUT IT WASN'T ME.

56:06.188 --> 56:09.583
IT WASN'T ME.
I'M GONNA KILL HIM, NOT YOU.

56:09.627 --> 56:14.196
OKAY? OKAY?

56:14.240 --> 56:17.591
HE'S A MONSTER.
I DIDN'T DO IT, AND NO ONE
WOULD LISTEN TO ME.

56:21.029 --> 56:23.205
SOMETHING WOKE ME UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

56:23.249 --> 56:25.556
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

56:25.599 --> 56:27.775
HE WAS ALREADY IN THE HOUSE.

56:27.819 --> 56:30.387
...HOUSE.

56:30.430 --> 56:32.693
IT WAS TOO LATE.

56:32.737 --> 56:34.782
HE KILLED THEM.

56:34.826 --> 56:37.394
THEY BLAMED ME FOR MURDERS.

56:37.437 --> 56:41.398
HE WAS RIGHT THERE ON THE BUS
WITH ME. THEY CAUGHT HIM.

56:41.441 --> 56:43.574
I KNEW THEN I HAD TO KILL HIM
BEFORE HE KILLED ME.

56:43.617 --> 56:45.793
...KILLED ME.

56:45.837 --> 56:49.580
THE BUS CRASHED AND HE ESCAPED,
AND I FOLLOWED AFTER HIM.

56:49.623 --> 56:52.583
-WELL, HOW MANY ARE THERE?
-THE BUS WAS FULL, BUT HE WAS
THE ONLY ONE WHO SURVIVED,

56:52.626 --> 56:54.280
AND ME.

56:56.630 --> 56:59.285
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

56:59.328 --> 57:01.722
WE'RE GONNA KILL HIM.

57:01.766 --> 57:03.724
NO, HEY,
FORGET ABOUT KILLING HIM.

57:03.768 --> 57:05.334
LET'S FIND A WAY OUT OF HERE.

57:05.378 --> 57:07.989
KILLING HIM IS OUR ONLY WAY
OUT OF HERE.

57:10.644 --> 57:12.429
COME ON.

57:13.560 --> 57:14.779
COME ON.

57:31.665 --> 57:33.319
WE NEED TO MOVE.

57:35.669 --> 57:36.888
OKAY.

57:47.507 --> 57:49.466
SHIT. OH, RICO, RICO.

57:49.509 --> 57:51.293
SHH. DUDE.
DUDE, DUDE, DUDE.

57:51.337 --> 57:53.644
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

57:53.687 --> 57:55.907
I AIN'T TRYING TO BE MISTAKEN
FOR ONE OF THOSE DAMN MANIACS.

57:55.950 --> 57:59.650
SHH!

57:59.693 --> 58:01.303
GET SPENCER ON
THE DAMN WALKIE, MAN.

58:01.347 --> 58:03.523
I DROPPED IT, I DROPPED IT.
IT'S GONE, IT'S GONE.

58:03.567 --> 58:05.873
IT'S GONE, IT'S GONE.

58:05.917 --> 58:08.006
YO, THERE IS SOME SHIT
GOING DOWN IN THIS PLACE!

58:08.049 --> 58:09.921
GO BACK!

58:09.964 --> 58:12.837
SHIT!

58:39.341 --> 58:41.866
OH, IT'S PERFECT.

58:41.909 --> 58:43.171
IT'S PERFECT.

58:48.568 --> 58:52.224
IT'S ALL PERFECTION.

58:52.267 --> 58:56.707
I THINK REAL PEOPLE
ARE REALLY DYING OUT THERE,

58:56.750 --> 59:02.539
AND I'M IN HERE RECORDING
EVERY SECOND OF IT!

59:04.105 --> 59:06.194
OH, MY GOD!

59:06.238 --> 59:10.416
NO! YES! YES! YES!

59:12.200 --> 59:13.288
YES.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.567
NO, NO, NO, DON'T SHOOT!

59:30.610 --> 59:32.438
THAT MIGHT BE RICO.
HE'S ONE OF US.

59:32.481 --> 59:36.703
RICO, IF THAT'S YOU,
TAKE OFF YOUR MASK.

59:39.401 --> 59:40.402
KILL HIM.

59:43.231 --> 59:44.972
NO, PLEASE.
I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE OF THIS.

59:45.016 --> 59:46.583
PLEASE, CAN WE JUST
FIND A WAY OUT OF HERE?

59:46.626 --> 59:48.454
NOT UNTIL HE'S DEAD.

59:58.725 --> 01:00:00.597
NO. NO!

01:00:04.818 --> 01:00:06.385
STOP, STOP! NO, STOP!

01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:30.278
LOOK, I THINK THE MAIN EXIT
IS STRAIGHT UP FROM HERE.

01:00:31.758 --> 01:00:33.542
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:00:35.588 --> 01:00:37.155
SIT DOWN, OKAY?

01:00:39.113 --> 01:00:40.593
IT'S OKAY.

01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:48.079
I NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION
QUICK, OKAY?

01:00:48.122 --> 01:00:50.255
-QUICK, QUICK.
-OKAY, WHAT DID THE MILITARY

01:00:50.298 --> 01:00:51.822
TRAIN YOU TO DO
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS?

01:00:51.865 --> 01:00:53.258
THE FUCK IS THIS?

01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:55.260
THERE IS NO SITUATION
LIKE THIS!

01:00:55.303 --> 01:00:58.916
SOME PSYCHO'S KILLING PEOPLE
FOR NO REASON AT A FRIGHT FEST?

01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:01.179
NO TRAINING
FOR SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.

01:01:01.222 --> 01:01:02.833
OKAY, OKAY.
BUT, I MEAN, WHAT WERE YOU?

01:01:02.876 --> 01:01:05.357
WERE YOU ARMY? MARINE?
WHAT WAS THE TRAINING?

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.012
I DID SIX WEEKS.

01:01:08.055 --> 01:01:10.884
FITNESS BOOT CAMP
FOR THE GIG.

01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.976
YOU WERE NEVER ENLISTED?

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.282
HELL, NO.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.854
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE'S DOING THIS?

01:01:23.897 --> 01:01:25.725
-WHY DO YOU THINK
HE'S DOING THIS?
-OKAY, SHH!

01:01:25.769 --> 01:01:27.118
WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF HERE.

01:01:27.161 --> 01:01:30.687
WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE IT OUT OF HERE, OKAY?

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:32.689
I LEARNED A LOT
IN THAT BOOT CAMP.

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:34.691
YOU WERE NEVER
IN THE MILITARY, OKAY?

01:01:34.734 --> 01:01:37.911
THERE'S A REALLY, REALLY
GOOD CHANCE WE'RE GONNA DIE.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:41.654
HELL, NO. HELL, NO.

01:02:52.507 --> 01:02:54.988
SHH, SHH, SHH.

01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:10.221
DON'T SHOOT!

01:03:10.264 --> 01:03:12.223
OH, THAT HURTS!

01:03:12.266 --> 01:03:14.312
OH, DEAR, THAT HURTS.

01:03:17.837 --> 01:03:20.144
HERE, TAKE THESE.

01:03:20.187 --> 01:03:22.189
WHAT ARE THEY?

01:03:22.233 --> 01:03:23.321
PAINKILLERS.

01:03:23.364 --> 01:03:25.758
YEAH. OKAY, WELL...

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.020
OKAY.

01:03:27.064 --> 01:03:28.413
WHAT IS GOING ON OUT THERE?

01:03:28.456 --> 01:03:32.547
HE IS KILLING EVERYONE.

01:03:32.591 --> 01:03:35.333
THEY'RE FROM SOME
MENTAL INSTITUTION.

01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:37.770
I COULD GIVE A SHIT
WHERE HE'S FROM.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.294
WE'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE.
RIGHT NOW.

01:03:40.338 --> 01:03:41.600
YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT.

01:03:41.643 --> 01:03:43.776
WHO ARE YOU,
THE PSYCHO WHISPERER?

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.647
HE'LL KILL YOU
BEFORE YOU GET THERE.

01:03:45.691 --> 01:03:47.911
LOOK, YOU GUYS, I SAY WE'RE
GONNA MAKE IT, OKAY?

01:03:47.954 --> 01:03:50.609
-AND HE SAYS WE'RE GONNA DIE.
-NO, HE'S KILLING EVERYONE.

01:03:50.652 --> 01:03:53.438
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:03:53.481 --> 01:03:55.875
HE KNOWS EVERY CORNER
OF THIS PLACE.

01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:59.531
GODDAMN THAT HURT.

01:03:59.574 --> 01:04:02.012
YOU STILL THINK WE'RE NOT
GONNA MAKE IT, SMARTASS?

01:04:02.055 --> 01:04:03.622
WE'RE GETTING THE--

01:04:03.665 --> 01:04:05.450
WE'RE GETTING THE HELL
OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW,

01:04:05.493 --> 01:04:06.668
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY.

01:04:06.712 --> 01:04:08.018
YOU GUYS CAN STAY HERE
IF YOU WANT TO.

01:04:08.061 --> 01:04:10.542
WE'RE GETTING OUT RIGHT NOW.

01:04:29.561 --> 01:04:32.477
LET'S GO, GUYS.
THERE'S NOTHING TO SEE HERE.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:35.915
-GO WHERE?
-THEY'RE FRIED.

01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:37.699
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.
LET'S JUST GO.

01:04:37.743 --> 01:04:39.005
WHAT THE HELL?

01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:40.572
JUST DON'T LOOK AT THEM.

01:04:40.615 --> 01:04:42.791
REALLY?

01:04:42.835 --> 01:04:45.229
WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO LOOK?
THERE ARE BODIES EVERYWHERE.

01:04:45.272 --> 01:04:47.579
I NEVER KNEW THAT MANY PEOPLE
CAME TO THIS KIND OF THING.

01:04:49.102 --> 01:04:50.930
-OH, MY GOD, IT'S MOVING.
-DON'T SHOOT.

01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:52.497
-SHOOT IT!
-I GOT IT! I GOT IT!

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:54.151
NO, NO, NO, DON'T SHOOT!
DON'T SHOOT!

01:04:54.194 --> 01:04:57.894
-DON'T SHOOT!
-GODDAMN IT, BRO!

01:04:58.938 --> 01:05:00.244
I ALMOST SHOT YOUR DUMB ASS.

01:05:00.287 --> 01:05:01.593
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING
UNDERNEATH THERE?

01:05:01.636 --> 01:05:03.073
WHAT KIND OF QUESTION
IS THAT, MAN?

01:05:03.116 --> 01:05:05.945
I'M HIDING!
I'VE SEEN SOME CRAZY SHIT.

01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:07.729
OH, JESUS CHRIST,
THIS CAN'T BE REAL.

01:05:07.773 --> 01:05:09.688
WAIT, HAS ANYBODY
SEEN MAXINE?

01:05:09.731 --> 01:05:11.516
WHO'S HE?

01:05:11.559 --> 01:05:12.909
MASON.

01:05:12.952 --> 01:05:14.301
WE DON'T GOT TIME FOR THIS.
LET'S JUST GET--

01:05:14.345 --> 01:05:15.737
LET'S FIND ANOTHER WAY OUT.

01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:17.130
YOU WERE YELLING
SOMETHING TO US.

01:05:17.174 --> 01:05:19.524
WHAT WERE YOU
TRYING TO TELL US?

01:05:19.567 --> 01:05:21.091
DUDE, LET'S GO. WE HAVE TO--
RICO, LET'S GO!

01:05:21.134 --> 01:05:22.962
WELL, DON'T TOUCH
THE DAMN BEDFRAME, MAN.

01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:24.355
YOU'LL FRY.

01:05:33.146 --> 01:05:35.757
NOTHING A SHOTGUN
AND SOME GOOD AIM CAN'T SOLVE.

01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:37.934
GREAT, NOW WE'RE COMPLETELY
IN THE DARK.

01:05:37.977 --> 01:05:40.719
-I WANT TO GO HOME.
-TOSS ME THE GUN.

01:05:40.762 --> 01:05:45.942
NOBODY TOUCHES
THIS GUN BUT ME.

01:05:50.816 --> 01:05:52.992
NO, WAIT!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:56.691
I'M GETTING US OUT OF HERE.

01:05:56.735 --> 01:05:58.084
WHAT THE HELL WOULD
YOU PEOPLE DO WITHOUT ME?

01:05:58.128 --> 01:05:59.303
NO, NO, NO!

01:06:02.306 --> 01:06:04.873
NO!

01:06:04.917 --> 01:06:06.788
WHAT?

01:06:06.832 --> 01:06:08.486
NO!

01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:14.622
WHAT DO WE GOT?

01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:16.146
SOMETHING,
SOMETHING, SOMETHING.

01:06:16.189 --> 01:06:18.409
COME ON.

01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:20.802
NOPE, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE.

01:06:20.846 --> 01:06:22.804
OKAY.

01:06:22.848 --> 01:06:25.807
I GOTTA FIND A CABLE.
FIND A CABLE, CABLE, CABLE.

01:06:25.851 --> 01:06:27.592
WHAT'S THAT?

01:06:27.635 --> 01:06:28.767
NOPE.

01:06:31.422 --> 01:06:32.684
AHH.

01:06:36.949 --> 01:06:39.821
YES! THANK GOD!

01:06:39.865 --> 01:06:41.606
I CAN KEEP RECORDING.

01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:51.311
HOW DID HE EVEN ELECTRIFY
THAT THING?

01:06:51.355 --> 01:06:53.400
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

01:06:53.444 --> 01:06:56.403
ISN'T HE, UM, INSANE?

01:06:56.447 --> 01:06:59.015
HE'S CRAZY, NOT STUPID.

01:06:59.058 --> 01:07:00.016
WHAT WAS THAT?

01:07:01.887 --> 01:07:03.845
A MONSTER...

01:07:03.889 --> 01:07:05.847
THAT WE'RE GONNA KILL.

01:07:07.458 --> 01:07:10.417
AND WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU?

01:07:10.461 --> 01:07:12.376
BECAUSE I HAVE THE SHOTGUN.

01:07:12.419 --> 01:07:14.856
THAT'S TRUE,
AND HE DID TRY TO SHOOT

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.641
THAT FREAK AND NOT ME.

01:07:16.684 --> 01:07:18.034
GREAT.

01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:34.876
YEAH, YOU COME FRY ME,

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.661
NO ONE'S GETTING IN HERE.

01:07:36.704 --> 01:07:39.229
AND I GOT IT ALL RECORDED,

01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:41.187
YOU UGLY BASTARD.

01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:43.668
FORGET "FACES OF DEATH."

01:07:43.711 --> 01:07:45.452
YEAH, WES CRAVEN, MY ASS.

01:07:45.496 --> 01:07:48.151
SPENCER CROWE'S BACK!

01:07:48.194 --> 01:07:49.630

01:08:03.209 --> 01:08:04.167

01:08:06.169 --> 01:08:07.300
SPENCER.

01:08:08.301 --> 01:08:10.912
-SPENCER.

01:08:24.752 --> 01:08:27.103

01:08:42.814 --> 01:08:43.814
I CAN'T JEOPARDIZE MY SAFETY.

01:08:43.858 --> 01:08:46.165

01:08:59.352 --> 01:09:02.921
IT'S ON THE FLOOR
NEXT TO THE MONITORS.

01:09:02.964 --> 01:09:06.751
YOU NEED TO CALL
THE POLICE, OKAY?

01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:08.404

01:09:13.323 --> 01:09:14.627
WHERE'S THE KEY?

01:09:14.671 --> 01:09:17.196

JUST GET IT OPEN.

01:09:35.823 --> 01:09:37.825
SMASH IT INTO THE WALL.

01:09:42.526 --> 01:09:45.180

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.588

NO SHIT, I'M HIS DEALER.

01:10:56.469 --> 01:10:57.992

01:14:18.366 --> 01:14:20.978
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?
I'M SORRY.

01:14:21.021 --> 01:14:22.936

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:34.382
WHAT DOES HE WANT WITH YOU?

01:14:34.426 --> 01:14:35.775
I DON'T KNOW.

01:14:35.819 --> 01:14:37.385

WE'RE LOCKED IN HERE.

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:32.005
AS LONG AS HE'S BREATHING,
WE'RE NOT SAFE.

HE'S DEAD.

01:16:35.982 --> 01:16:40.596
OH, THIS GUY IS GOOD.

01:16:55.828 --> 01:16:58.265
