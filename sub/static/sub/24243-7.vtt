00:17.036 --> 00:20.303
- Wow. Looks like a fun party.
- You should see

00:20.328 --> 00:22.168
the inside. It's like a
bomb went off in there.

00:22.625 --> 00:23.838
What's with all the bikes?

00:24.471 --> 00:25.814
Bunch of bike couriers.

00:26.339 --> 00:28.440
We confiscated enough
MDMA to kill a buffalo.

00:28.514 --> 00:30.849
Ha. Or make it really happy.

00:32.319 --> 00:33.935
Neighbours called in a noise complaint.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.954
Unis were on their way
when a second call came in

00:35.989 --> 00:39.458
- reporting a body in the alley.
- One of these guys call it in?

00:39.846 --> 00:41.804
Donnie's collecting
cell phones as we speak,

00:41.829 --> 00:44.047
so we'll know soon enough. We're waiting

00:44.072 --> 00:45.864
on vans and they're
late again, as always.

00:45.898 --> 00:49.034
A bunch of under-slept
bike couriers coming down.

00:49.068 --> 00:52.204
Fun times. I can't wait
to take statements.

00:52.238 --> 00:54.239
Fiona's with the body.
Make sure you check in

00:54.264 --> 00:55.982
- with her before you do, OK?
- Mmhmm.

00:59.428 --> 01:01.863
I don't know who looks
worse: you or them.

01:02.855 --> 01:03.882
You OK?

01:04.784 --> 01:06.451
Me? I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be?

01:07.095 --> 01:08.228
Kyle...

01:23.201 --> 01:24.596
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:25.204 --> 01:27.172
The victim's 28 years
old, a bike courier.

01:27.206 --> 01:29.007
His name's Philip Heward.

01:29.042 --> 01:31.910
- Heward? The whiskey?
- Yeah, I guess it's possible.

01:31.935 --> 01:35.537
- It's an out-of-province ID.
- OK. No holes, no knife wounds

01:35.562 --> 01:37.716
- and his wallet's still here.
- So he wasn't robbed.

01:38.126 --> 01:40.594
Well, not if they left
him carrying this.

01:40.619 --> 01:43.142
- He's a dealer.
- Maybe someone

01:43.167 --> 01:44.970
didn't like what he was
selling, let him know.

01:44.995 --> 01:47.159
Well, he fought back.
His hands are pretty scraped up,

01:47.184 --> 01:49.052
and that ring will
have done some damage.

01:49.703 --> 01:52.318
All right. Let's prioritize
individuals who look like

01:52.343 --> 01:54.434
they've been in a fight.
So check hands, next faces

01:54.459 --> 01:56.701
- for signs of combatants.
- I'll canvass the neighbours,

01:56.736 --> 01:58.547
- see what they know.
- Oh, I already have uniform

01:58.571 --> 02:00.616
boots on the ground. Why don't
you and Price talk to the owner?

02:00.640 --> 02:02.692
What, are you saying that one
of those kids owns this house?

02:02.716 --> 02:05.182
No, it's a weekend rental and
that looks like the owner there.

02:05.207 --> 02:07.646
- His name's Ted Matthews.
- Ted Matthews.

02:07.713 --> 02:09.854
Well, I hope Ted Matthews is insured.

02:13.651 --> 02:15.347
It's her bird bath.

02:15.698 --> 02:18.356
I understand this must come
as a shock to you, Mr. Matthews,

02:18.381 --> 02:20.225
but we have a few questions
we need to ask you.

02:20.259 --> 02:22.561
Lily loved her garden. I mean,

02:22.595 --> 02:24.930
- look what they've done to it!
- Is Lily your wife?

02:24.964 --> 02:27.132
- Mm-hmm.
- We understand that you

02:27.166 --> 02:30.735
- rented the house out.
- Just for the weekend, online.

02:30.865 --> 02:33.138
To who? Have you seen him here?

02:33.717 --> 02:34.803
Uh...

02:36.379 --> 02:37.426
No.

02:38.010 --> 02:40.479
He was a polite young man.

02:40.513 --> 02:43.548
I mean, there was a whole bio
and photo of him on the website.

02:43.616 --> 02:45.817
He even brought the deposit

02:45.852 --> 02:47.953
in cash so I wouldn't
have to do one of those...

02:47.987 --> 02:51.045
- e-mail transfer things.
- Cash, huh?

02:51.158 --> 02:52.420
- Mm-hmm.
- Can we see

02:52.445 --> 02:54.771
- the renter's agreement?
- Yes, it's in my bag...

02:56.351 --> 02:57.996
which I left at the hospital.

02:58.632 --> 03:00.902
- The hospital?
- My wife.

03:01.634 --> 03:03.199
She has a brain tumour.

03:03.636 --> 03:05.737
I've been staying at my sister's,

03:05.805 --> 03:08.707
near the hospital.
We're renting this place out

03:08.741 --> 03:11.276
for extra cash. We're saving.

03:11.806 --> 03:14.813
There's a clinic in Mexico and
a doctor who can help her there.

03:15.457 --> 03:18.183
Don't worry about this mess.
Your insurance'll cover it.

03:18.217 --> 03:20.922
No. No, you don't understand.

03:21.087 --> 03:23.522
Everything's been going
towards her treatment.

03:23.556 --> 03:25.690
I can't afford insurance.

03:26.930 --> 03:27.993
I'm done for.

03:29.070 --> 03:31.007
We're going to have to
bring you down to the station

03:31.031 --> 03:34.166
for a full statement, sir.
You can get a ride with us.

03:38.238 --> 03:39.671
Come on, guys.

03:39.705 --> 03:41.394
If you don't mind
stepping up, just a few

03:41.419 --> 03:43.220
- short questions for you.
- It'll be super easy and we'll

03:43.244 --> 03:45.957
- have you on your way. Promise.
- Awesome. That's exactly

03:45.982 --> 03:48.023
- how I wanna spend my day off.
- Come on, people. The faster

03:48.047 --> 03:50.424
you get in, the faster you go home.
Think of it like

03:50.449 --> 03:53.151
a spa day without the spa part.

03:57.723 --> 04:00.091
What the hell are you doing here?

04:00.159 --> 04:01.893
- Nice to see you too.
- Come on.

04:01.928 --> 04:03.688
- Where are we going?
- Away from here.

04:03.713 --> 04:05.173
OK. What's the big deal?

04:06.075 --> 04:08.384
You're strong. Did you work out? Whoa.

04:08.632 --> 04:09.665
What the hell happened

04:09.690 --> 04:11.814
- to your face?
- I fell off my bike.

04:11.938 --> 04:14.739
- While high?
- No. I hit a curb wrong.

04:14.774 --> 04:16.373
Your eyes are pinned!

04:16.709 --> 04:19.644
I... I don't know.
I mean, I smoked a joint.

04:20.036 --> 04:22.012
What? It's a party.
What do you want from me?

04:22.897 --> 04:25.584
I mean, here I thought you
were out west planting trees,

04:25.618 --> 04:28.253
eating organic. Now I find
you at a murder scene?!

04:28.287 --> 04:30.121
Yeah. Well, I like to
keep things interesting.

04:31.707 --> 04:34.355
I'm kidding. I got bored. I came back.

04:34.380 --> 04:36.198
I thought you were
cleaning up out there.

04:36.223 --> 04:38.430
I did clean up. No more needles.

04:38.464 --> 04:41.466
What about coke? Hm? Right.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.269
Right. Is that why you were
partying with these all-stars?

04:44.303 --> 04:46.523
They're bike couriers
and I'm one of them.

04:47.508 --> 04:48.907
You gonna help me out or not?

04:49.344 --> 04:51.105
Only if you swear to me

04:51.130 --> 04:53.691
you know nothing about
what happened back there.

04:53.945 --> 04:55.214
I swear.

04:58.884 --> 05:00.022
Get in.

05:20.263 --> 05:22.222
OK. So I just got off
the phone with the

05:22.247 --> 05:24.256
victim's parents. Good
call on the whisky.

05:24.343 --> 05:26.311
Turns out this kid was
heir to an empire.

05:26.336 --> 05:28.077
Phil's a rich kid.
Is there a motive there?

05:28.102 --> 05:30.559
Well, doubtful, only because
about four years ago, his folks

05:30.584 --> 05:33.020
washed their hands of him, but...
anyway, they're

05:33.045 --> 05:35.552
- flying in from BC now.
- They must be devastated.

05:35.638 --> 05:38.199
And connected. Which means
we're gonna need answers

05:38.224 --> 05:39.363
by the time they get here.

05:39.388 --> 05:42.003
Happily, we have about
30 potential witnesses

05:42.028 --> 05:44.432
waiting for us out there,
so we have our work cut out for us.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.659
OK, everybody. Let's do this, huh?

05:48.941 --> 05:51.366
All right. There's a text on
your lock screen here that says,

05:51.391 --> 05:53.138
"1278 Sycamore. Midnight.

05:53.172 --> 05:55.140
Be there." Do you have
any idea who sent that?

05:56.373 --> 05:58.043
But you didn't actually throw the party,

05:58.068 --> 05:59.566
you were just spreading the word.

06:00.850 --> 06:02.294
Whose party was it, then?

06:04.388 --> 06:05.617
His name's Billy.

06:06.145 --> 06:08.129
They said he provides a killer evening.

06:09.045 --> 06:10.288
It's not what I had in mind.

06:10.473 --> 06:12.133
I paid 20 bucks to get in.

06:12.158 --> 06:13.559
Who'd you pay the 20 bucks to?

06:17.386 --> 06:19.354
Now you are not Billy,

06:19.498 --> 06:21.466
but you collected the cover fee for him.

06:21.500 --> 06:25.245
No. She's lying 'cause I'm
into her friend and not her.

06:26.299 --> 06:28.873
- Who collected the cover fee?
- It was some...

06:28.941 --> 06:32.210
dude with crazy hair.
He was also selling molly.

06:34.955 --> 06:36.314
I don't see him here.

06:36.947 --> 06:39.217
We know there were drugs at the party.

06:39.721 --> 06:42.520
- Were you selling MDMA?
- Were you selling?

06:43.326 --> 06:44.966
No, of course not.

06:44.991 --> 06:46.524
What, have you taken a vow of silence?

06:46.559 --> 06:48.626
Come on. Just give me
something here, sunshine.

06:48.694 --> 06:50.250
Do you know who was selling?

06:51.130 --> 06:54.282
Do you know your name?
Do you know what day it is?

06:54.433 --> 06:56.534
My friend bought a couple
of lines, OK? Not me.

06:56.569 --> 06:59.175
Of what, cocaine? I thought MDMA

06:59.200 --> 07:01.837
- was the drug of the hour.
- All I know is

07:01.862 --> 07:03.793
the guy in the alley was
definitely selling coke.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.243
The victim, Phil Heward?

07:05.277 --> 07:06.689
Yeah. My friend thought he was hot.

07:08.158 --> 07:09.714
Sorry.

07:10.033 --> 07:11.502
I think I'm gonna barf.

07:11.946 --> 07:13.413
In the basket.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.862
- What's your name?
- Sarah Dawson.

07:23.896 --> 07:26.898
- Date of birth?
- 23rd of May.

07:28.351 --> 07:30.235
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hi.

07:30.269 --> 07:32.604
How you doing?
I don't think I'm ever gonna get

07:32.638 --> 07:34.439
this bike-greaser BO off of me.
Somebody wanna

07:34.473 --> 07:36.754
give me a hand with the rest
of these muddy ankles? Finch?

07:36.842 --> 07:38.910
No. I'm on phones and IDs.

07:38.935 --> 07:40.278
Come on. I'll buy you lunch.

07:40.346 --> 07:42.447
I'll buy you two lunches.
Finch, listen to me.

07:42.481 --> 07:44.916
- I will buy you all the lunches.
- Anyone know anything

07:44.950 --> 07:47.118
- about this 911 call?
- It came from a payphone

07:47.153 --> 07:49.921
near the scene, but there's
no CCTV cameras in the area.

07:50.413 --> 07:53.609
What about the IDs?
Have you come across a guy named Billy?

07:53.843 --> 07:56.261
He was the one that hired
the place, threw the party.

07:56.489 --> 07:58.761
Oh, really? Because according
to the rental agreement,

07:58.786 --> 08:00.165
it was... Lance Armstrong.

08:00.497 --> 08:02.100
Ted is not a cycling fan.

08:02.134 --> 08:04.569
- What's this?
- It's nothing yet.

08:05.091 --> 08:07.572
Nothing my ass. That is Jac's brother.

08:08.185 --> 08:09.607
What are you doing with his ID?

08:10.368 --> 08:11.579
What?

08:12.868 --> 08:14.422
Answer the question, Detective.

08:15.126 --> 08:16.953
What are you doing with his ID, huh?

08:19.195 --> 08:21.853
Would someone like to tell me where
the hell Detective Cooper is?

08:32.986 --> 08:34.885
What happened to finishing your degree?

08:35.058 --> 08:36.932
I thought you only had
like, one credit left.

08:36.957 --> 08:38.316
Yeah. Well, not everyone
is obsessed with

08:38.340 --> 08:40.841
their careers, Jac.
Besides, I prefer the school of life.

08:41.116 --> 08:43.719
Oh. Where are you staying?

08:43.950 --> 08:46.018
You really don't read my emails, do you?

08:46.034 --> 08:48.369
No. I figured you were
just asking for something,

08:48.403 --> 08:51.801
- as per usual.
- Well, if you did read them,

08:51.826 --> 08:53.176
you'd know I'm staying with dad.

08:54.675 --> 08:56.492
Well, I mean,
I would've stayed at your place,

08:56.517 --> 08:58.652
but you didn't even get back to me.

08:59.865 --> 09:01.082
Did you know the dead guy?

09:02.138 --> 09:03.150
No.

09:03.513 --> 09:06.220
I mean... I think his name
was Phil or something.

09:06.647 --> 09:09.256
And he didn't have anything
to do with your banged-up face?

09:09.291 --> 09:12.259
No! OK? I told you. I... I...

09:12.296 --> 09:15.565
Fell off your bike.
I know what you told me.

09:15.848 --> 09:17.020
You don't believe me?

09:18.168 --> 09:21.102
I'll... I'll drop you off
on my way to the division.

09:21.515 --> 09:23.204
As far as my coworkers know,

09:23.238 --> 09:25.439
you were never there. OK?

09:25.507 --> 09:26.527
OK.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.801
Except I gave them my ID.

09:39.237 --> 09:40.308
Sorry.

09:43.911 --> 09:45.634
All right. Let's get his hands now.

09:46.707 --> 09:48.963
You saved my ass just to
throw it under the bus, huh?

09:48.997 --> 09:50.662
Owen, please be quiet!

09:52.451 --> 09:54.068
All right. His clothes as well.

09:54.529 --> 09:55.970
You've gotta be kidding me.

09:56.004 --> 09:57.321
You heard what he said.

09:59.298 --> 10:00.307
Hey, don't you think

10:00.375 --> 10:02.309
you should check in with
Medusa at some point?

10:02.593 --> 10:03.593
Yeah.

10:05.797 --> 10:07.415
Nice of you to drop by.

10:07.449 --> 10:10.513
- Boss, I was just headed...
- My office. Now.

10:17.726 --> 10:19.694
Close the door behind you.

10:21.863 --> 10:24.165
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I'm...

10:24.199 --> 10:26.391
I'm sorry. I just wanted
to bring him in myself.

10:26.438 --> 10:28.211
Or maybe you realized that we had his ID

10:28.236 --> 10:31.682
and you had no choice. This is a major

10:31.707 --> 10:33.507
breach of trust, Jac.

10:33.895 --> 10:35.585
You could've compromised
the investigation,

10:35.610 --> 10:38.646
never mind the integrity
of this entire squad.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.482
Trust me, he didn't do anything.
I know my brother.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.574
He is a person of interest
who looks like he was in

10:43.599 --> 10:46.582
- a physical altercation today.
- He fell off his bike.

10:51.406 --> 10:53.440
I'm gonna need your badge and your gun.

10:56.665 --> 10:58.666
Seriously.

11:00.790 --> 11:01.882
Phone too.

11:03.171 --> 11:05.482
- My phone? Really?
- You removed

11:05.507 --> 11:06.922
a potential suspect

11:07.431 --> 11:10.320
from a crime scene.
You are now officially a witness

11:10.345 --> 11:13.255
in this investigation,
possibly an accessory after the fact.

11:13.567 --> 11:15.958
- An accessory?
- You will be held in isolation

11:15.983 --> 11:18.364
- until you can be questioned.
- No, I... I know I made

11:18.389 --> 11:20.189
a mistake, but you
don't have to do this.

11:20.192 --> 11:22.776
Actually, I do. You have tied my hands

11:22.801 --> 11:25.503
and you know what happens now. Let's go.

11:28.467 --> 11:30.731
Jac, they're acting like I
did something wrong. Tell them

11:30.766 --> 11:32.218
- that I just fell off my bike!
- Why is he cuffed?

11:32.242 --> 11:33.724
Keep walking. Don't talk to him.

11:33.749 --> 11:35.638
- All this because of his face?
- Jac!

11:37.535 --> 11:38.653
All right. Sit down.

11:39.638 --> 11:41.352
Someone will be with you shortly.

11:47.616 --> 11:49.649
When we ran Owen's ID,
guess who we found

11:49.674 --> 11:52.680
- on his record of arrest?
- Phil Heward?

11:53.555 --> 11:55.918
Oh... God. This is so bad.

11:56.176 --> 11:58.259
It appears they did quite
a bit of business together:

11:58.293 --> 12:00.168
selling, trafficking,
always side-by-side.

12:00.645 --> 12:02.763
A real Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid.

12:03.068 --> 12:04.772
So you think things got ugly?

12:06.647 --> 12:07.935
Poor Jac.

12:08.250 --> 12:11.238
No. We're not gonna feel sorry for her.

12:11.602 --> 12:12.692
Do you understand me?

12:13.379 --> 12:15.943
But oh, I could just shake her!
I swear to God...

12:16.590 --> 12:18.056
Right. What do you want me to do?

12:18.360 --> 12:19.939
I want you to talk to the brother.

12:20.681 --> 12:23.258
Let him loosen up first,
but he may know something

12:23.283 --> 12:24.937
that will help us, and
I want him to talk.

12:25.069 --> 12:26.954
How long do you want
me to let him stew for?

12:26.988 --> 12:29.711
Well, like any other suspect, you
know, 'til he's soft and gooey.

12:31.414 --> 12:33.127
Don't go easy on him, Stevie.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.297
He's a person of
interest, Jac or no Jac.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.305
All right? We do our job

12:39.634 --> 12:41.052
- no matter what.
- Yeah.

12:41.719 --> 12:42.912
Of course.

13:01.690 --> 13:04.130
- Man, that sucks.
- I know. Dude, there's like

13:04.155 --> 13:06.289
- a zillion of these things.
- I meant Jac.

13:06.561 --> 13:09.005
Oh, yeah. Well, actually,
I'm kind of surprised

13:09.030 --> 13:11.364
the boss didn't kick her ass
all over this bullpen, so...

13:11.486 --> 13:12.490
Here, look. Look.

13:13.090 --> 13:14.699
He doesn't look like your type, Donnie.

13:14.724 --> 13:17.459
All right. Look,

13:17.664 --> 13:19.531
she's cheek-to-cheek with this creep,

13:20.033 --> 13:22.643
and her post is,
"Me and Billy chillin'."

13:22.677 --> 13:24.511
And it's time-stamped
for three this morning.

13:24.579 --> 13:26.339
Good. Let's find out who she is.

13:26.846 --> 13:27.948
Already done.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.030
Yeah. OK.

13:35.056 --> 13:38.192
- It doesn't prove it's my feed.
- How stupid do you think I am?

13:38.378 --> 13:39.403
Don't...

13:39.428 --> 13:40.933
yeah, don't answer that.

13:41.906 --> 13:43.666
It's quite clear that you and Billy

13:43.691 --> 13:44.783
have a relationship.

13:46.439 --> 13:48.774
Right.

13:48.904 --> 13:51.305
All right. I'm gonna...
I just gotta tell you,

13:51.936 --> 13:53.540
aiding and abetting a murderer,

13:53.873 --> 13:55.709
you are looking at 10 years.

13:55.734 --> 13:58.007
You can't put me in
jail for dating somebody.

13:58.032 --> 13:59.699
I can if I prove that you
tried to help him commit

13:59.723 --> 14:02.826
a crime, which this statement,
your statement, "Cops coming,

14:02.851 --> 14:05.386
we gotta bail." It kind of does for me.

14:08.726 --> 14:09.823
What do you want?

14:09.858 --> 14:11.618
I want you to tell me
everything you know about Billy,

14:11.642 --> 14:13.643
and I want you to start
with his last name.

14:19.267 --> 14:21.025
They sent you to interview me?

14:22.404 --> 14:23.876
Yeah. Everyone else was busy.

14:25.944 --> 14:27.845
Well, how is he? Is he all right?

14:29.778 --> 14:31.190
You know I can't tell you anything.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.002
I need to make you aware that
I am recording this interview...

14:39.026 --> 14:40.228
You can skip this part.

14:41.838 --> 14:43.244
OK.

14:43.934 --> 14:45.713
When was the last time
you saw your brother?

14:46.658 --> 14:49.596
A... year ago, maybe longer.

14:50.336 --> 14:51.732
OK. So I take it you guys

14:51.766 --> 14:53.734
- aren't close.
- Not really.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.324
I mean, not anymore.

14:56.535 --> 14:58.349
When you saw him today,
were you surprised that he'd be

14:58.373 --> 15:00.527
- at a party like that?
- No.

15:01.518 --> 15:02.541
I mean, yes,

15:02.566 --> 15:05.080
I was surprised to see him there.

15:05.135 --> 15:07.815
But... he had troubles growing up.

15:08.035 --> 15:09.783
You know, drugs, booze.

15:10.542 --> 15:11.785
We had a bit of a...

15:11.820 --> 15:13.787
rough start and he never got over it.

15:14.474 --> 15:15.789
Does he have an anger problem?

15:16.755 --> 15:17.891
No.

15:17.926 --> 15:21.518
Not at all. When we were kids, he
used to cry if I killed a mosquito.

15:21.543 --> 15:23.948
When you saw your brother at
the scene, did you ask him

15:23.973 --> 15:26.252
- about the homicide?
- Yeah, of course I did.

15:26.606 --> 15:28.283
I asked him if he had any information

15:28.308 --> 15:29.803
about it and he said he didn't.

15:29.838 --> 15:30.998
And you took him at his word?

15:33.099 --> 15:34.286
Has he lied to you before?

15:37.145 --> 15:39.078
Yeah, but that was a long time ago.

15:41.414 --> 15:43.587
Did he make you aware that
he had a personal relationship

15:43.611 --> 15:46.947
with the victim? They had
committed repeated drug-related

15:46.972 --> 15:48.209
offences together.

15:50.302 --> 15:51.325
No.

15:51.562 --> 15:52.703
He did not.

15:54.523 --> 15:56.127
Knowing that you had orders

15:56.152 --> 15:58.493
to question the party-goers
who had been injured,

15:58.518 --> 16:00.137
why did you then not do that

16:00.201 --> 16:01.434
when you saw your brother?

16:01.732 --> 16:03.999
I'm sorry, is this a
disciplinary interview

16:04.190 --> 16:05.483
or an interrogation?

16:06.562 --> 16:08.022
It's both, Jac.

16:39.181 --> 16:40.780
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

16:40.944 --> 16:42.705
All these hipsters kind
of look the same to me.

16:42.729 --> 16:43.755
Heh heh.

16:49.058 --> 16:51.042
HEY! Get out of the way!

16:55.114 --> 16:57.154
Out of the way! Out of the way!
Out of the way! Hey!

16:58.250 --> 16:59.401
Coming through!

17:31.567 --> 17:34.102
OH!

17:36.992 --> 17:39.040
Oh, you came out of nowhere, kid!

17:39.065 --> 17:40.860
There, there. No, no.
Don't get up. Don't get up.

17:40.884 --> 17:43.119
Just flip over. Yeah.
There you go, sunshine.

17:43.412 --> 17:45.680
- Nice driving, Donnie.
- Thank you, buddy.

17:45.714 --> 17:47.982
- I wasn't expecting that at all.
- Yeah, neither was he.

17:48.148 --> 17:50.752
- You really surprised me there.
- All right.

17:52.913 --> 17:55.097
Phil Heward was found dead
earlier this morning at a party

17:55.121 --> 17:56.681
you threw. What do you know about that?

17:57.794 --> 17:59.310
You can't really think I killed him.

17:59.734 --> 18:01.702
Look at me.
Why did you run then?

18:02.194 --> 18:03.710
I run because people chase me.

18:04.006 --> 18:05.731
Are you going to pay for
damages to my bike?

18:06.629 --> 18:07.686
Smart kid.

18:07.981 --> 18:10.119
Nice clothes. No one would ever
suspect you of breaking the law,

18:10.143 --> 18:12.626
would they? Makes you feel
smarter than other people?

18:13.704 --> 18:15.276
I am smarter than other people.

18:15.311 --> 18:17.777
Not smart enough to choose
the right girlfriend, though.

18:18.314 --> 18:20.364
- Ginny?
- Yeah. She told us how you hired people

18:20.389 --> 18:22.657
to work that party, sell drugs for you.

18:23.843 --> 18:26.640
Interesting theory. Can I see
some evidence to back that up?

18:26.889 --> 18:28.570
I got a feeling that
laptop will provide us

18:28.595 --> 18:29.789
with all the details we need.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.656
See, this is the third rental
house of the month to be trashed

18:32.680 --> 18:35.358
at a party. I bet once I get
our tech guys to do a deep dive

18:35.383 --> 18:38.264
on that hard drive,
I can trace all those back to you.

18:40.102 --> 18:42.573
It's a smart plan:
target an unsuspecting guy

18:42.598 --> 18:45.950
like Ted Matthews, rent his house
out under a fake name, throw a party,

18:46.100 --> 18:48.484
- push your product.
- Even if it was true,

18:48.509 --> 18:49.907
it doesn't mean I killed anybody.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.962
Yeah, except you hired
people to sell drugs.

18:53.212 --> 18:55.569
Your drugs. And your girlfriend
said that you were none

18:55.594 --> 18:57.994
too pleased when your realized
that people were moonlighting.

18:58.085 --> 18:59.983
- What do you mean?
- The victim was selling

19:00.008 --> 19:01.600
his own cocaine and
pocketing the cash while he

19:01.624 --> 19:04.158
was on the clock for you.
Ginny said you were pissed about that,

19:04.361 --> 19:05.423
which I could understand.

19:06.695 --> 19:09.977
OK, maybe it's true,
but all I did was ask the guy to leave.

19:10.352 --> 19:11.681
If all you did was ask him
to leave, how'd he get

19:11.705 --> 19:14.278
- the bashed-in head?
- I don't know. Ask Owen Cooper.

19:14.303 --> 19:15.867
He's the one who had a fight with him.

19:19.529 --> 19:21.576
So the kid had the funds

19:21.610 --> 19:23.655
to do whatever he wanted with
his life and he chose drugs.

19:23.679 --> 19:25.647
Oh, yeah. And lots of 'em.

19:25.785 --> 19:27.067
Toxicology came back.

19:27.801 --> 19:30.752
There is so much cocaine
in this guy's system.

19:30.786 --> 19:32.450
I mean, I don't know about you,
but I just can't party

19:32.474 --> 19:34.942
- like that anymore.
- Yeah.

19:36.699 --> 19:37.926
Are you OK?

19:38.689 --> 19:41.385
Ugh. One of my detectives, her brother's

19:41.410 --> 19:44.521
under investigation and...
ugh. It's a big mess.

19:45.005 --> 19:47.001
Owen Cooper is related to Jac?

19:47.794 --> 19:49.409
How do you know Owen Cooper?

19:49.434 --> 19:51.269
Oh, man! I saw it in
the file but I didn't

19:51.294 --> 19:52.863
- put it together.
- Yeah?

19:53.232 --> 19:55.600
Oh. The cuts on Owen's knuckles

19:55.625 --> 19:57.745
and the back of his hand
were consistent with a fight.

19:58.061 --> 20:01.077
Then, Sergeant Price sent me his
picture. They swabbed this cut.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.005
There's silver residue in it
that matches the silver ring

20:04.030 --> 20:05.515
from our victim's right hand.

20:06.021 --> 20:08.690
Also, Owen's shirt tested
positive for our victim's blood.

20:09.963 --> 20:12.189
So Owen and Phil were
definitely in a fight.

20:12.814 --> 20:15.460
That is an understatement.
It was a nasty fight.

20:15.804 --> 20:18.077
Check it out. That's a
broken nose and Phil

20:18.102 --> 20:21.103
died from a cerebral hemorrhage.
There are internal injuries

20:21.139 --> 20:23.212
that indicate some kind
of weapon was used.

20:23.237 --> 20:25.976
This isn't just fists,
some kind of hard object.

20:26.001 --> 20:27.891
Was there anything like
that found at the scene?

20:29.845 --> 20:30.899
No.

20:39.542 --> 20:40.830
Fiona just called me.

20:41.340 --> 20:42.724
She wants you out of the building.

20:42.758 --> 20:44.493
Well, why can't I just
wait 'til he's done?

20:45.618 --> 20:47.267
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you

20:47.292 --> 20:50.129
to help me out, Aaron.
Let me at least see him

20:50.154 --> 20:51.191
before I go!

20:52.629 --> 20:55.826
I'm all he's got. He needs me.

20:57.103 --> 20:58.951
I have to escort you out.

21:09.878 --> 21:11.644
Finally! I've been asking for you.

21:11.769 --> 21:13.207
I only have a minute
so you need to listen.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.454
No, no, no. It doesn't matter.

21:14.479 --> 21:15.834
They already think I did it.
Look, you need

21:15.858 --> 21:18.307
- to tell them that I'm innocent.
- Are you innocent?

21:21.291 --> 21:23.731
- Do you believe me?
- What matters right now

21:23.766 --> 21:25.174
is what Stevie believes,

21:25.300 --> 21:27.117
which is why you need
to be honest with her.

21:27.142 --> 21:29.077
She can sniff out a lie a mile away.

21:29.102 --> 21:31.236
She will like you if you
tell her the truth.

21:32.033 --> 21:33.767
OK, but wh...

21:33.919 --> 21:35.384
Hey, come on. Time's up.

21:36.612 --> 21:38.761
I gotta go. You can do this.

21:50.665 --> 21:52.173
Looks like you've been in a fight.

21:53.123 --> 21:55.876
No. I'm a pacifist, a Buddhist.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.041
A man is dead, Owen.

21:59.162 --> 22:00.900
Don't waste my time.

22:03.819 --> 22:05.772
I thought you weren't
gonna lose your job for me.

22:06.848 --> 22:08.581
Yeah. Well, if it was
my brother in there,

22:08.606 --> 22:11.057
I'd break in myself, so... I get it.

22:14.005 --> 22:16.873
The pathologist has
confirmed that Phil's blood

22:16.898 --> 22:18.463
was on your shirt.

22:19.069 --> 22:20.518
And we know that his ring

22:20.543 --> 22:22.416
made that gash under your eye.

22:23.021 --> 22:25.422
Billy Chamberlain told
us that he hired you

22:25.457 --> 22:27.324
to sell MDMA at the house party

22:27.392 --> 22:29.159
where Phil's body was found.

22:29.747 --> 22:30.806
You've worked for him

22:30.831 --> 22:32.989
on three separate occasions.

22:33.379 --> 22:35.399
I don't sell drugs anymore.
Billy's lying.

22:36.747 --> 22:38.764
I think we know who's lying.

22:39.934 --> 22:41.144
You do it again,

22:41.550 --> 22:42.940
and we're done.

22:43.183 --> 22:44.371
You got that?

22:45.177 --> 22:47.694
She's right. He's lying.

22:47.779 --> 22:49.580
Just let me talk to my sister.

22:50.101 --> 22:51.892
You can't talk to your sister.

22:52.283 --> 22:55.063
- That is a non-starter.
- He's not doing

22:55.098 --> 22:56.669
- what I said.
- But I'm her partner.

22:56.694 --> 22:59.695
- Come on, Owen. Stop fronting.
- A friend...

23:00.466 --> 23:02.860
which means I am not here to trap you,

23:03.813 --> 23:05.896
but I do need you to tell me the truth.

23:08.841 --> 23:09.865
OK.

23:09.890 --> 23:11.945
OK? Good.

23:13.961 --> 23:15.045
That's very good.

23:17.009 --> 23:18.034
So...

23:19.144 --> 23:21.902
obviously, you and Phil fought,

23:22.191 --> 23:24.314
and soon after, he was found dead.

23:25.371 --> 23:27.684
We were only supposed to sell
for a few hours, that's it.

23:27.719 --> 23:30.120
Easy. But... Phil always

23:30.155 --> 23:32.065
had to make things more
difficult, you know?

23:32.191 --> 23:34.525
By selling his own drugs
and pocketing the money.

23:35.313 --> 23:36.660
Yeah. It made me look bad.

23:36.694 --> 23:39.196
So... what, you ratted Phil out?

23:39.489 --> 23:40.849
It was either him or me.

23:41.474 --> 23:43.033
Billy told him to beat it,

23:43.101 --> 23:45.588
but Phil couldn't go easily.

23:45.689 --> 23:47.604
- He got pissed off.
- You know, if hadn't just

23:47.672 --> 23:49.150
been such a...

23:50.502 --> 23:53.377
Billy had one of his heavies
take him out into the alleyway.

23:53.411 --> 23:55.846
Phil, being a total nut job,
he started smashing his bike

23:55.880 --> 23:58.216
into the backyard fence,
trying to get back into the party.

23:58.747 --> 24:01.185
And I worked hard to make a
connection with Billy, you know?

24:01.856 --> 24:03.520
For both of us. And Phil,

24:03.555 --> 24:05.963
he made me look like a goddamn amateur.

24:05.988 --> 24:08.859
So you wanted to stop him,
show Billy that you...

24:08.893 --> 24:10.727
- you weren't both amateurs.
- Yeah.

24:11.013 --> 24:12.955
But I just... I wanted to talk to him.

24:12.980 --> 24:14.725
I ran into the alley to talk...

24:15.142 --> 24:17.110
man to man, but he... he...

24:17.601 --> 24:20.370
he didn't wanna listen, and he...
he... he...

24:21.242 --> 24:23.240
he freaked out.
He... he threw a swing at me.

24:23.428 --> 24:26.637
- You were defending yourself?
- Yeah. He laid into me,

24:26.662 --> 24:28.051
and I... I started punching him.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.881
He's gonna make himself
look guilty because he sucks

24:30.915 --> 24:33.822
- at high-pressure situations.
- It got out of control.

24:34.497 --> 24:35.689
I need your phone.

24:37.956 --> 24:41.291
And then what? Hm?

24:41.804 --> 24:43.760
You pick something up off the ground?

24:43.795 --> 24:45.544
Something... hard

24:45.569 --> 24:47.797
and metal and you hit him with it?

24:47.844 --> 24:50.610
No. No. He got back on his bike

24:50.635 --> 24:52.414
and he kept ramming it into the fence.

24:52.704 --> 24:56.273
It was a fixie... a sweet fixie.
It was cream with green rims.

24:56.307 --> 24:58.709
No, Owen. No bike was
found on the scene.

24:58.795 --> 25:01.600
No! I... I'm not lying, OK?
I'm telling you the truth now.

25:01.920 --> 25:05.846
He was on it. I... I... I...
I went back in the house

25:05.871 --> 25:07.652
and I got a beer and
then the cops showed up.

25:07.677 --> 25:09.200
And that was the last
time that you saw him.

25:09.224 --> 25:10.246
Yeah!

25:10.271 --> 25:12.768
- And he was OK?
- I think so. Yeah.

25:16.661 --> 25:18.595
I think so.

25:19.259 --> 25:21.265
- Yeah.
- You think

25:21.299 --> 25:22.392
or you know?

25:24.194 --> 25:25.234
What?

25:26.137 --> 25:27.788
Who the hell called him?

25:27.880 --> 25:30.851
Owen, was Phil OK when you left him?

25:32.896 --> 25:34.372
Honestly, I, um...

25:37.310 --> 25:38.466
...I don't know.

25:41.185 --> 25:43.454
I thought that's what
happened, and, uh...

25:45.446 --> 25:46.496
I don't remember.

25:49.527 --> 25:52.429
Maybe I killed him. Maybe I hit
him so hard that I killed him.

25:57.843 --> 26:00.019
OK. Detective.

26:01.026 --> 26:02.097
Had your fun?

26:02.707 --> 26:05.075
Until I've conferred with Mr. Cooper

26:05.143 --> 26:07.044
in private,
that'll be just about everything.

26:07.111 --> 26:08.823
What the hell are you doing here?

26:09.113 --> 26:10.821
I'm saving my client.

26:17.661 --> 26:18.822
Hi, Owen.

26:18.856 --> 26:22.316
I'm Marc Savage. Your sister called me.
Do you take cream or black?

26:23.753 --> 26:25.909
As I'm sure I don't need to
remind everyone, the clock

26:25.934 --> 26:29.972
is ticking, but I want no stone
unturned because if we are

26:29.997 --> 26:32.050
gonna charge Owen Cooper
with murder, it will be

26:32.075 --> 26:35.138
because we know, 100 percent,
without a shadow of a doubt

26:35.349 --> 26:36.763
that he killed Philip Heward.

26:36.989 --> 26:38.702
I thought that he confessed.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.838
I doubt we'll be able to use that.

26:40.872 --> 26:43.387
Because Marc Savage is
representing him now and he

26:43.412 --> 26:44.794
interrupted that interview.

26:45.083 --> 26:47.866
So, further to that,
I want to remind everyone of protocol:

26:48.249 --> 26:51.550
no contact with Detective
Cooper until this is cleared up.

26:52.574 --> 26:54.131
This unit is impeccable...

26:54.880 --> 26:56.114
and it's gonna stay that way.

26:56.438 --> 26:57.741
OK. Back to work.

27:03.544 --> 27:05.480
Hey. Hey. You're worrying.

27:05.505 --> 27:08.146
- Don't worry.
- What do you mean, don't worry?

27:08.232 --> 27:10.033
My brother just confessed to murder!

27:10.067 --> 27:12.784
That's not going to stick.
We'll say he made it

27:12.809 --> 27:14.810
under duress.
He was sleep-deprived. He didn't

27:14.835 --> 27:16.870
know what he was saying, OK?
You just need to stay calm

27:16.894 --> 27:18.762
and not make this any worse, OK?

27:18.909 --> 27:22.478
I know that'll be hard for you,
but you have to try.

27:23.752 --> 27:26.225
Look, I meant what I said on the phone.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.361
I'll sign whatever you want,

27:28.493 --> 27:31.275
a confidentiality agreement or whatever.

27:31.689 --> 27:33.189
I will stop holding

27:33.230 --> 27:34.964
what happened over your head, OK?

27:35.025 --> 27:37.060
We'll talk about that later.
Right now, I want you

27:37.085 --> 27:39.041
to go home. All right?

27:39.066 --> 27:41.334
I'm gonna take care of this.
Wait! Jac! Jac!

27:41.398 --> 27:42.460
Where are you going?!

27:47.578 --> 27:48.852
How was the briefing?

27:48.877 --> 27:50.117
What are you doing here?

27:50.631 --> 27:52.852
Fiona's gonna have your head
on a platter if she finds out.

27:52.876 --> 27:55.912
You think he did it,
don't you? You decided

27:55.937 --> 27:57.852
he was guilty before he said one word.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.923
Jac, I know that you are
hurting but I have to do my job.

28:00.951 --> 28:02.885
Now you have to go home. I'm serious.

28:03.245 --> 28:05.421
You took one look him,
remembered the stories

28:05.456 --> 28:07.010
that I told you, and saw a criminal.

28:07.239 --> 28:09.039
That is not true, and I

28:09.064 --> 28:10.865
am offended that you
would even think that.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.942
You're offended?!
I saw the way you looked at him.

28:12.967 --> 28:15.966
I looked at him like he is
a suspect in a murder case,

28:16.710 --> 28:19.240
and I think you need to face
the reality that Owen might

28:19.273 --> 28:22.548
- actually be involved in this.
- Yeah? Face the reality

28:22.573 --> 28:25.354
like you're facing reality
about your feelings for Kyle?

28:25.526 --> 28:28.206
And how you're risking your
whole marriage over them?

28:30.809 --> 28:34.083
Why are you here? I sent you home!

28:34.108 --> 28:35.740
- She's leaving.
- No. I'm not.

28:35.765 --> 28:37.787
Charge me with something
or bring me back in.

28:38.388 --> 28:41.290
Are you trying to force my hand?
'Cause, um, I'm not in the mood.

28:41.358 --> 28:43.236
You can't penalize me if
I haven't been convicted

28:43.260 --> 28:45.061
of anything. That's protocol.

28:45.095 --> 28:47.063
Oh, OK. So...

28:47.305 --> 28:48.938
you call your union rep

28:48.963 --> 28:51.430
and you tell them I'm out of line,
and be sure to mention

28:51.455 --> 28:54.457
that stunt you pulled today.
You wanna get charged, Jac?

28:54.671 --> 28:57.774
Be my guest because I've
just about had it with you.

28:58.192 --> 28:59.206
Go home.

28:59.810 --> 29:02.652
- Please.
- Looks like I

29:02.677 --> 29:04.978
- better have a word with Finch.
- No, no. Finch...

29:05.075 --> 29:07.142
Finch didn't have anything
to do with this, OK?

29:07.167 --> 29:09.335
He walked me to the door
and I snuck back in myself.

29:09.653 --> 29:11.991
Then perhaps he better walk
you a little further this time.

29:14.892 --> 29:17.260
We got unis looking for a
bike that fits the description

29:17.294 --> 29:18.729
in the neighbourhood but nothing so far.

29:18.753 --> 29:21.571
It's probably just another
one of Owen's fabrications.

29:21.758 --> 29:24.112
Right. Let's walk through
what we know so far.

29:24.701 --> 29:26.065
All right. Look.

29:26.870 --> 29:28.801
The 911 call came in from a pay phone

29:28.891 --> 29:31.597
outside a convenience
store near the house.

29:32.355 --> 29:34.273
Now really, who uses a flippin' payphone

29:34.298 --> 29:35.713
- these days anyway, right?
- Someone who doesn't

29:35.737 --> 29:37.156
- wanna be traced.
- Exactly.

29:37.181 --> 29:39.426
So how far is the
convenience store to the house?

29:39.716 --> 29:41.809
You wanna know if Owen had
enough time to leave the house,

29:41.833 --> 29:44.420
get rid of the weapon,
make the call and get back to the house.

29:46.827 --> 29:48.374
But why would he make the
call in the first place?

29:48.398 --> 29:51.300
I don't know, Stevie.
Guilt. Philip was his friend.

29:51.829 --> 29:53.773
That doesn't explain why he went back.

29:59.771 --> 30:01.737
Thanks for not throwing
me under the bus earlier.

30:02.256 --> 30:04.540
Yeah. I saved my colleague

30:04.575 --> 30:06.943
and drove it right over my own brother.

30:09.014 --> 30:10.981
This thing will work
itself out, all right?

30:11.415 --> 30:12.900
Nobody wants to charge your brother.

30:13.151 --> 30:14.550
He didn't do it.

30:14.892 --> 30:16.839
I just need to prove it.

30:19.267 --> 30:20.429
Wait.

30:21.672 --> 30:23.226
Turn the car around.

30:23.260 --> 30:26.028
Oh, no. No. I'm not...

30:26.063 --> 30:28.064
I'm not gonna take you
back to the scene, OK?

30:28.098 --> 30:29.842
If I don't get back right away,
Fiona will know.

30:29.866 --> 30:32.501
So that's just not gonna happen.
Forget about it, OK?

30:48.919 --> 30:51.220
Noise complaint came in at 5:46AM.

30:51.255 --> 30:53.066
And what time did the
unis arrive on the scene?

30:53.090 --> 30:55.424
6:20. By the time they got there,

30:55.459 --> 30:58.194
the 911 call had come in.
EMC arrived at 6:35,

30:58.228 --> 31:00.871
so the body dropped
between 5:46 and 6:20.

31:00.896 --> 31:03.498
That is enough time for Owen
to get to the convenience store

31:03.523 --> 31:05.446
and back if he was the
one that made the call.

31:06.515 --> 31:08.281
Five minutes, OK? And then we go.

31:08.306 --> 31:09.360
Yeah.

31:10.247 --> 31:12.415
So this is where we found Phil.

31:15.545 --> 31:17.680
Now, Owen said the
last time he saw Phil,

31:17.748 --> 31:18.984
he was on his bike.

31:22.387 --> 31:23.441
That...

31:23.810 --> 31:26.122
is where Phil rammed
that bike into the fence,

31:26.156 --> 31:28.142
just like Owen described. Look...

31:28.450 --> 31:31.689
- he was telling the truth.
- So where's the bike?

31:31.837 --> 31:33.861
OK. So I got the call at
7 to go to the scene.

31:33.886 --> 31:34.972
I arrived at 8.

31:34.997 --> 31:37.910
Then the owner arrives at 8:14.

31:37.935 --> 31:41.268
They called him at 7:59.
He showed up 15 minutes later

31:41.293 --> 31:42.707
- at the scene.
- What? No.

31:43.260 --> 31:46.143
- 7:59, 8:15.
- No. It is not possible.

31:46.246 --> 31:48.247
He was staying at his sister's...

31:48.621 --> 31:50.732
near Saint Victoria's Hospital,
so that he could

31:50.757 --> 31:52.644
- be close to his wife.
- Yeah, so?

31:52.669 --> 31:53.757
Look.

31:55.482 --> 31:58.618
So that is way further
than 15 minutes away.

31:59.452 --> 32:00.817
He must have been closer.

32:02.526 --> 32:04.067
So why is he lying to us?

32:04.793 --> 32:06.662
They already canvassed
the whole neighbourhood for

32:06.686 --> 32:08.166
- that bike. They found nothing.
- Well, they must have been

32:08.190 --> 32:10.579
looking in the wrong place.

32:18.275 --> 32:20.409
Look. The colours match

32:20.436 --> 32:22.413
Owen's description of Phil's bike.

32:22.444 --> 32:24.981
- Forensics didn't catch that.
- Yeah, but tiny specs like this

32:25.015 --> 32:26.615
are easy to lose in the dirt and gravel.

32:26.883 --> 32:28.363
I don't understand.

32:28.699 --> 32:30.715
I'm the victim here.

32:33.109 --> 32:35.348
Mr. Matthews,
why does your cell phone's GPS

32:35.373 --> 32:37.901
put you at the exact same
time and place the 911 call

32:37.926 --> 32:39.662
came in from a payphone

32:40.322 --> 32:42.244
- on Miller Road?
- What?

32:42.269 --> 32:44.451
How could you have made that
call if you hadn't already seen

32:44.475 --> 32:47.110
a dead body? Hmm?

32:47.804 --> 32:50.539
Which means that you
were at the crime scene

32:50.574 --> 32:52.401
before you met us this morning.

32:53.854 --> 32:55.760
But why would Phil's
bike just be flaking paint?

32:55.785 --> 32:57.625
The paint on those bikes,
they don't just shed.

32:57.860 --> 32:59.177
Look, there's more.

33:00.818 --> 33:01.984
Maybe there was

33:02.019 --> 33:04.053
an impact with a hard object.

33:04.087 --> 33:06.046
- Most likely metal.
- Yeah.

33:09.593 --> 33:12.161
What kind of metal object hits bikes?

33:16.133 --> 33:17.901
I'm thinking it must have
been really hard for you to rent

33:17.925 --> 33:20.705
that place out.
It meant so much to your dying wife.

33:21.071 --> 33:22.905
It must've hurt like
hell when you showed up,

33:23.244 --> 33:26.409
see the place trashed like that.
Some young punk

33:26.443 --> 33:28.377
ramming his bike up against your fence.

33:28.768 --> 33:30.542
Your wife is dying,

33:30.831 --> 33:33.591
and yet this loser is
all free and clear.

33:34.551 --> 33:35.973
I think you snapped.

33:36.208 --> 33:39.622
If a car hits a bike,
the car gets damaged too.

33:45.899 --> 33:47.063
Aaron, look.

33:47.542 --> 33:48.704
I see it.

33:51.043 --> 33:53.373
Mr. Matthews, it's
unlikely a man your age

33:53.398 --> 33:55.466
would've done the kind
of damage we saw on Phil.

33:57.067 --> 33:58.186
Unless, say...

33:58.371 --> 33:59.775
you used your car.

33:59.810 --> 34:02.969
Oh, that's ridiculous.
I didn't even know him.

34:03.524 --> 34:05.735
You ran him over, didn't you?

34:06.743 --> 34:08.050
You revved your engine.

34:08.085 --> 34:09.815
You drove towards him. He saw you.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.940
He took off... but you didn't stop.

34:12.869 --> 34:14.300
- Hey, what are you doing?
- What does it look

34:14.324 --> 34:15.577
like I'm doing?

34:16.326 --> 34:18.170
You hit him. He flew off his bike,

34:18.661 --> 34:20.376
and the impact of the fall killed him,

34:20.764 --> 34:22.353
gave him a cerebral hematoma.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.657
Caused his brain to bleed.

34:33.217 --> 34:34.949
Every day...

34:35.978 --> 34:37.277
I sit with her.

34:39.649 --> 34:41.270
I hold her hand and I tell her,

34:43.156 --> 34:44.496
"It's gonna be OK."

34:46.804 --> 34:48.454
Because that's all I can do.

34:50.618 --> 34:51.891
And I'm tired of it...

34:52.896 --> 34:54.918
of being powerless.

34:57.834 --> 34:59.473
Not so powerless anymore...

35:01.126 --> 35:02.371
am I?

35:09.099 --> 35:11.099
Thanks for everything today,

35:11.384 --> 35:13.952
- I won't forget it.
- You know, I think

35:13.986 --> 35:16.254
you and I should go for
a proper drink sometime.

35:16.668 --> 35:18.332
- Jac...
- Owen!

35:18.908 --> 35:20.139
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:21.098 --> 35:23.202
- Ooh! Ow. Ha ha.
- Sorry. Sorry.

35:25.496 --> 35:27.032
Thanks for busting me out.

35:27.910 --> 35:29.000
Given everything,

35:29.035 --> 35:30.995
I figured you might just
leave me in there to rot.

35:31.284 --> 35:32.884
Well, we should probably
get out of here.

35:33.862 --> 35:36.797
Hey, I understand why you
had to do what you had to do.

35:37.285 --> 35:38.364
Ditto.

35:41.714 --> 35:43.903
Jac, could I have a word before you go?

35:45.251 --> 35:46.339
One sec.

35:51.257 --> 35:53.392
Before you say anything,

35:53.417 --> 35:54.903
I want to apologize.

35:55.256 --> 35:57.591
What I did today...
I should have been smarter.

35:57.742 --> 36:00.105
Well, it was understandable.
You love your brother and you

36:00.130 --> 36:01.738
- wanted to protect him.
- Yeah.

36:02.016 --> 36:03.719
That is it exactly.

36:04.470 --> 36:05.727
- OK.
- But...

36:06.352 --> 36:08.320
just because it was understandable

36:08.628 --> 36:10.139
doesn't make it excusable.

36:11.889 --> 36:13.345
I can't trust you

36:13.819 --> 36:15.992
and I need to be able to trust

36:16.017 --> 36:18.051
every single person in my unit.

36:19.046 --> 36:21.753
But I was right! Owen
didn't do anything.

36:21.788 --> 36:23.561
I'm removing you from the third division

36:23.586 --> 36:26.553
when your rotation is up.
I think you might be better off

36:26.578 --> 36:28.813
somewhere else... with someone else.

36:28.838 --> 36:31.587
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Please don't do this.

36:31.612 --> 36:33.434
This is where I belong.

36:34.043 --> 36:35.707
I know that I screwed up today

36:35.732 --> 36:37.270
but I can make it better. Just...

36:37.904 --> 36:40.721
please give me the chance
to make this better.

36:41.174 --> 36:42.846
That's all I wanted to say.

36:45.446 --> 36:47.143
Close the door on your way out, please.

37:07.037 --> 37:09.872
You live here? Wow.

37:10.102 --> 37:12.382
I guess sometimes working
for the man does pay off.

37:12.672 --> 37:15.273
Yeah. It does.

37:15.695 --> 37:16.937
Hey!

37:17.276 --> 37:19.261
No way! You still have this thing?

37:19.512 --> 37:21.680
Actually, that's a new one.

37:23.257 --> 37:25.480
Oh, wow. I remember this.

37:26.316 --> 37:27.597
It looks just like the old one.

37:27.622 --> 37:29.990
You loved this thing. You used
to sleep with it every night.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.982
No, you used to sleep
with it every night.

37:34.443 --> 37:36.294
Yeah. I guess I always had a vice, huh?

37:44.608 --> 37:46.061
You know, you, uh...

37:46.086 --> 37:48.220
you really saved me today, so thank you.

37:50.501 --> 37:53.035
You know, every time my phone rings

37:53.151 --> 37:55.003
I'm worried someone's
gonna be on the other end

37:55.050 --> 37:58.174
telling me you're dead?
You know, I realized it would

37:58.212 --> 37:59.408
probably be a relief,

37:59.855 --> 38:01.655
because I'd finally know where you were.

38:07.159 --> 38:09.402
I'm... I'm sorry, Jac.

38:10.668 --> 38:12.199
I... hate

38:12.463 --> 38:15.184
the sound of that word
coming out of your mouth.

38:15.926 --> 38:17.655
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

38:18.678 --> 38:20.115
You're right. Yeah.

38:20.255 --> 38:21.752
You're... you're right.

38:23.650 --> 38:24.666
Yup.

38:26.106 --> 38:28.647
It shouldn't have been Phil in
that alley. It should've been me.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.023
- No, I never said that.
- No, it's true.

38:31.450 --> 38:34.805
The guy came from a rich family.
He had everything and I...

38:35.727 --> 38:38.066
I mean, I'm the one who
got him into this crap.

38:39.854 --> 38:41.480
I resented him

38:41.850 --> 38:44.082
for having such an easy ride.

38:45.762 --> 38:47.731
So I let him down, like always.

38:47.756 --> 38:50.077
Then change that, Owen.

38:50.983 --> 38:53.170
- Do something!
- I can't!

38:53.967 --> 38:55.225
Look at me!

38:58.523 --> 39:00.089
Are you shooting up again?

39:02.997 --> 39:04.425
Jesus, Owen!

39:04.450 --> 39:06.934
I tried to stop. I did.

39:10.339 --> 39:11.566
Don't you get it?

39:12.391 --> 39:14.359
This... thing

39:14.393 --> 39:15.918
doesn't work right anymore.

39:16.462 --> 39:17.512
It's just...

39:18.050 --> 39:19.824
OK.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.606
- OK.
- I'm sorry.

39:27.206 --> 39:30.460
Why do you hate yourself so much?

39:32.046 --> 39:33.585
I can help you.

39:33.610 --> 39:36.111
I know people, but you need to let today

39:36.136 --> 39:37.707
be a wake-up call.

39:38.226 --> 39:40.361
Wake up, Owen.

39:40.907 --> 39:41.969
Please.

39:45.881 --> 39:49.049
I just... I don't want
to be alone anymore.

39:49.167 --> 39:50.172
I know.

39:53.577 --> 39:55.878
So... stay here.

39:57.410 --> 39:58.814
Hmm? With me.

39:59.525 --> 40:01.106
I can take care of you,

40:01.140 --> 40:03.859
and we can beat it this time.

40:04.890 --> 40:06.664
Yeah. If anyone can, it's you.

40:11.994 --> 40:14.963
Oh, crap. That's the food, um...

40:16.106 --> 40:18.223
It's just downstairs.

40:18.290 --> 40:20.425
I'll be two seconds. Are you good?

40:20.459 --> 40:21.475
Yeah.

40:22.952 --> 40:25.444
Don't forget the hot sauce.

40:35.374 --> 40:36.417
Hey.

40:42.048 --> 40:43.915
What's with the suitcase?

40:44.251 --> 40:46.785
I'm taking the kids to
my parents' overnight.

40:46.819 --> 40:48.567
I think we need some time away.

40:49.522 --> 40:50.606
Time away?

40:52.598 --> 40:54.702
- OK, what the hell is going on?
- Sh.

40:55.213 --> 40:56.813
I don't want them to
know anything is up.

40:57.282 --> 40:58.836
I told them you've got
a lot of work to do

40:58.860 --> 41:01.562
- and you need your space.
- Why?

41:02.510 --> 41:03.535
I saw you...

41:04.434 --> 41:06.410
the other night. You and Kyle.

41:07.834 --> 41:09.348
I was taking out the garbage

41:09.373 --> 41:10.809
and I saw you guys kiss.

41:11.584 --> 41:13.840
That was not... what it looked like.

41:14.150 --> 41:16.286
He kissed me. I was...

41:16.582 --> 41:19.081
I was in shock. I was not expecting that

41:19.106 --> 41:21.386
so I j... I froze, but I
did not kiss him back.

41:21.411 --> 41:23.479
- I can't do this again.
- Do what?!

41:23.856 --> 41:25.249
I'm not 25 anymore.

41:26.249 --> 41:28.460
I know you cheated on me with him.

41:29.864 --> 41:31.322
You were in police college.

41:32.861 --> 41:34.190
I chalked it up to...

41:34.380 --> 41:36.323
you being stupid and young, but...

41:39.518 --> 41:41.064
Why didn't you tell me he was back?

41:42.607 --> 41:44.175
You left a family dinner

41:44.814 --> 41:46.745
the moment he texted you
and five minutes later,

41:46.779 --> 41:47.845
you're kissing him.

41:48.772 --> 41:49.849
So...

41:52.137 --> 41:53.341
what would you think?

41:54.443 --> 41:56.387
Please don't... don't do this.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.799
I didn't. You did.

42:06.298 --> 42:09.113
They didn't have any hot sauce,
so I just grabbed...

42:12.371 --> 42:13.421
Owen?

42:16.260 --> 42:17.913
Oh, come on!

42:19.111 --> 42:20.276
Oh!

42:22.135 --> 42:23.414
Damn it!

42:28.429 --> 42:29.621
Owen?

42:32.835 --> 42:33.858
It's me.

42:35.741 --> 42:36.970
Can I come in?
