00:14.100 --> 00:16.488
Oh, my God! Shit!

00:16.766 --> 00:17.814
Oh, my God!

02:22.687 --> 02:24.702
You? It was you the whole time?

02:49.967 --> 02:50.906
Guys, come on.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.791
She's gonna be here any second.

02:55.615 --> 02:56.615
Really?

03:31.366 --> 03:32.603
Hey, Dominic!

03:34.162 --> 03:36.691
Ilsa! I'm so glad you made it.

03:36.781 --> 03:37.796
Thanks for driving...

03:38.753 --> 03:40.602
Oh, and you brought people.

03:41.542 --> 03:43.026
-Great.
-You're so funny.

03:43.359 --> 03:44.922
-This is Dwayne.
-Pleasure.

03:45.283 --> 03:46.975
Hey, Dom. Yeah.

03:48.166 --> 03:49.300
Brought a shit-load of beer.

03:50.399 --> 03:51.426
Charming.

03:51.663 --> 03:53.083
Feel free to call me Dominic.

03:54.631 --> 03:55.682
And you are?

03:56.112 --> 03:57.111
Sarah. Hey.

03:57.201 --> 03:59.169
I'm friends with your
exchange student, Mariko.

03:59.430 --> 04:01.025
Well, isn't that something?

04:02.422 --> 04:04.134
Hope the couple miles
from the parking lot...

04:04.224 --> 04:05.946
...weren't too inconvenient for you.

04:06.089 --> 04:07.604
Yeah, man, I didn't even park there.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.072
Just drove right around that gate,

04:09.162 --> 04:10.403
went halfway up the logging road...

04:10.493 --> 04:11.766
...before the trail got too small.

04:12.229 --> 04:13.697
Well, that's a law broken.

04:15.912 --> 04:18.221
Pick that up before you
come inside, please.

04:18.404 --> 04:20.983
Ilsa, may I speak with you
in the kitchen for a moment?

04:23.387 --> 04:26.696
That hurts. What?

04:27.117 --> 04:30.024
Oh nothing, except that
you invited two strangers...

04:30.114 --> 04:31.227
...without asking me first.

04:31.317 --> 04:34.371
It was supposed to be you, me
and my exchange students.

04:34.461 --> 04:35.881
I don't have enough brie and shit.

04:36.675 --> 04:38.460
They are not strangers.

04:39.094 --> 04:41.062
Dwayne's kind of my boyfriend...

04:41.309 --> 04:43.554
...and Sarah knows Mariko
from the SAT course.

04:43.975 --> 04:45.871
I thought you and Sarah might...

04:46.998 --> 04:49.562
-Ilsa, she smokes.
-So?

04:49.697 --> 04:51.124
And he's like 45.

04:51.214 --> 04:52.775
Where the fuck do you find these people?

04:53.387 --> 04:56.347
I swear to God, you never
should have left private school.

04:56.608 --> 04:57.838
He's 23.

05:03.588 --> 05:04.821
You always do this.

05:04.911 --> 05:06.075
As long as I've known you,

05:06.165 --> 05:08.709
and I know that one day
you're gonna have to discern

05:08.799 --> 05:11.728
the people you can trust from
the people you just can't.

05:14.653 --> 05:17.041
Dominic, I'm sorry.

05:18.365 --> 05:20.849
I didn't know you
expected me to come alone.

05:21.483 --> 05:23.905
But we graduated and this
may be the last chance...

05:23.995 --> 05:25.725
...all my friends get to be together.

05:25.943 --> 05:27.807
I didn't want to leave anyone out.

05:31.712 --> 05:34.108
Fuck. Fine.

05:35.964 --> 05:36.980
It's fine.

05:39.153 --> 05:40.904
The weekend can still
go according to plan.

05:40.994 --> 05:42.898
What's two more people, after all?

05:54.302 --> 05:56.016
-Marcus.
-Hey, Dom!

05:57.309 --> 05:58.309
How are you?

05:59.369 --> 06:00.785
And you brought Rumor.

06:01.713 --> 06:03.456
It's like I never even graduated.

06:03.546 --> 06:05.125
Please, come in.

06:10.389 --> 06:13.520
Marcus, Rumor, everyone.

06:14.582 --> 06:16.928
Meet each other. Make yourselves at home.

06:17.018 --> 06:20.025
I need to go set up the loft
I wasn't planning on using.

06:20.837 --> 06:23.001
Marcus. I wasn't sure you'd come.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.383
Thanks for inviting me.

06:24.473 --> 06:26.378
Totally, thanks, Ilsa.

06:26.996 --> 06:29.451
Hey, Rumor, don't touch
any of my dad's shit.

06:30.117 --> 06:31.648
Sorry. Jeez.

06:32.937 --> 06:34.587
It'll be good to get
some you and me time.

06:34.677 --> 06:37.240
-Hey.
-Marcus, Dwayne.

06:37.651 --> 06:39.791
Marcus went to my old school
before I transferred.

06:39.881 --> 06:41.529
Yeah, yeah, Marcus from private school.

06:41.619 --> 06:42.920
I've heard a lot about you, man.

06:43.207 --> 06:44.826
Ilsa talks about you all the time.

06:47.571 --> 06:49.279
I've heard a bunch about you, too.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.222
How do you know Ilsa again?

06:52.748 --> 06:54.851
-I'm her boyfriend.
-Right.

06:57.269 --> 06:59.837
-Well, good to meet you, Dwayne.
-Yeah, man, likewise.

07:02.386 --> 07:04.647
God, you look great, Marcus.

07:05.803 --> 07:08.564
And you are miraculous.

07:08.787 --> 07:09.945
How's your novella coming?

07:10.299 --> 07:12.181
Oh, my God, I finished the first draft.

07:12.549 --> 07:14.033
What the fuck's a novella?

07:16.596 --> 07:17.957
You haven't read Ilsa's writing?

07:18.962 --> 07:20.652
Sounds like he hasn't read much at all.

07:22.389 --> 07:24.052
You have got to read her stuff, man.

07:24.142 --> 07:25.491
This girl is really good.

07:27.143 --> 07:29.420
Sylvia Plath meets Henry Miller.

07:29.681 --> 07:30.691
Shut up.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.650
The short story about
the clown's mouth, so good.

07:34.482 --> 07:35.489
Better than good.

07:36.466 --> 07:38.918
Beautiful. Perfect.

07:42.377 --> 07:43.480
You're making me blush.

07:43.643 --> 07:44.674
Well!

07:44.873 --> 07:46.625
Babe, we better go choose our bedroom...

07:46.715 --> 07:48.056
...and start unpacking.

07:54.796 --> 07:57.227
Just squat anywhere you like.

07:58.981 --> 08:00.624
Marcus and Rumor, you are in the loft.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.593
Great, I really appreciate it, Dominic.

08:02.819 --> 08:04.596
There are three beds up there, right?

08:04.826 --> 08:06.318
Yeah, but why do you need three beds?

08:08.373 --> 08:10.634
Well, Eli came up with us.

08:11.022 --> 08:12.490
He trailed back to smoke some pot.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.719
Eli Dako, Eli Dakota?

08:16.557 --> 08:20.171
That drug addict is staying
in my father's cabin?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.945
You guys know my dad...

08:22.035 --> 08:23.773
...is the police commissioner, right?

08:32.467 --> 08:34.623
I brought acid!

08:35.542 --> 08:37.320
And a shovel. Why is that?

08:38.589 --> 08:41.803
When Marcus said cabin, I thought
I'd have to dig holes.

08:42.453 --> 08:43.453
To shit in.

08:44.363 --> 08:46.331
This place is a mansion, dude.

08:47.673 --> 08:50.090
Right. So dig zero shit holes.

08:50.180 --> 08:52.941
Like, one shit hole is too many shit holes.

08:53.459 --> 08:54.834
All right, all right, all right.

08:55.388 --> 08:56.419
Hey, buck.

09:25.355 --> 09:26.434
Here we go again.

09:28.014 --> 09:29.021
What?

09:36.272 --> 09:38.240
Don't look, it just encourages them.

09:38.930 --> 09:40.509
Why does it bother you so much?

09:40.599 --> 09:41.625
Just ignore it.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.286
I'm not bothered by it,

09:43.548 --> 09:46.270
it's just lame to use us as
a prop in their sex play.

09:46.785 --> 09:49.134
They know we know what they're
doing, don't you think?

09:52.961 --> 09:54.627
Oh, I see.

09:55.799 --> 09:57.540
-What?
-Don't play dumb.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.463
I can smell you getting
all wet from here.

09:59.574 --> 10:01.502
Sarah.

10:01.597 --> 10:02.621
No?

10:02.985 --> 10:04.642
Must be Marcus' pussy I smell.

10:12.067 --> 10:15.098
Marcus, am I weird?

10:16.859 --> 10:17.874
No.

10:21.583 --> 10:24.033
I mean, I'm not like embarrassing
you or anything, am I?

10:24.123 --> 10:25.641
Oh, God.

10:26.789 --> 10:29.329
I mean, I know I was only invited because
you were invited.

10:30.642 --> 10:31.682
Okay, so?

10:34.046 --> 10:36.815
High school's over, Rumor.
You got to let it go.

10:38.475 --> 10:39.641
Look at this place.

10:43.855 --> 10:45.077
It's gonna be a good weekend.

10:47.510 --> 10:50.046
These guys always make me feel...

10:50.136 --> 10:51.755
...like I'm doing something wrong.

10:51.845 --> 10:53.543
Look, I want you here.

10:54.847 --> 10:55.894
I want you here.

10:57.005 --> 10:58.298
Nobody's going to cast you out.

11:02.405 --> 11:04.926
All right, all right, all right.
How about Marcus though, right?

11:05.816 --> 11:08.673
Should I even be worried
about the fucking pretty boy?

11:09.695 --> 11:11.755
Marcus is the best.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.480
You got no worries around him.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.599
He's a standup guy.

11:16.545 --> 11:18.401
-Everyone loves him.
-Yeah, I bet.

11:19.338 --> 11:22.290
I mean, what about him and Ilsa though?

11:24.424 --> 11:26.730
Oh, no. Yeah, you should
totally worry about that.

11:26.820 --> 11:27.774
Yeah.

11:27.864 --> 11:31.006
No, they're like perfect for each other.

11:31.265 --> 11:33.138
Yeah, sorry, I misunderstood you.

11:34.892 --> 11:36.217
It's cool man, thanks.

11:37.081 --> 11:38.098
Cool, cool.

13:28.586 --> 13:29.609
Eli, you okay?

13:30.101 --> 13:31.394
Take a look at that goose.

13:33.743 --> 13:36.536
-What?
-That goose out there.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.069
It's been there all day.

13:43.345 --> 13:44.872
I don't see a goose.

13:46.302 --> 13:49.473
It was there before and
there's no such thing as time.

13:54.031 --> 13:56.356
I don't know about you,
but I don't feel very safe.

14:23.220 --> 14:26.783
Hey. I'm so glad you could make it.

14:27.386 --> 14:29.557
Did someone else agree
to cover your shift?

14:29.647 --> 14:31.710
Oh, no. Not really.

14:31.833 --> 14:34.166
My boss said,
"Cover the dates or you're fired."

14:36.074 --> 14:39.239
You quit? Just to come here?

14:39.329 --> 14:40.329
Yep.

14:41.029 --> 14:42.822
I figured it was my last chance to see...

14:44.401 --> 14:45.520
...you.

14:48.575 --> 14:49.725
Marcus, I...

14:50.519 --> 14:51.614
No, I know.

14:55.086 --> 14:56.117
Look, I know you're with...

14:56.207 --> 14:58.293
-...this other guy, but I just...
-No, listen.

14:58.383 --> 15:00.550
I randomly hooked up
with Dwayne at a party...

15:00.640 --> 15:03.417
...and brought him here as a shield
against Dominic.

15:03.507 --> 15:04.507
He's not.

15:05.292 --> 15:06.292
I mean...

15:08.126 --> 15:09.848
You're the one.

15:32.548 --> 15:35.186
-Come back inside soon.
-All right.

15:36.086 --> 15:37.093
Yes.

16:04.971 --> 16:06.011
Fuck!

16:07.883 --> 16:08.930
I'm drunk.

16:09.149 --> 16:11.665
Yeah, beer and vodka will do that.

16:12.413 --> 16:14.786
Yeah,well, it's my drink, bud.

16:15.369 --> 16:16.601
The Vod Lager.

16:20.298 --> 16:21.320
What?

16:21.410 --> 16:23.414
You're comical with your Vod Lagers...

16:23.504 --> 16:24.680
...and your high school girls.

16:24.770 --> 16:27.405
Hey. A toast.

16:29.058 --> 16:30.756
I would like to apologise...

16:31.036 --> 16:33.464
...for my churlish behaviour earlier.

16:33.948 --> 16:35.773
It's going to be a great weekend...

16:35.863 --> 16:37.498
...and I'm glad you're all here.

16:38.731 --> 16:39.929
Cheers, Dominic!

16:40.206 --> 16:42.192
Dominic, this place is paradise.

16:43.218 --> 16:46.278
So, did all y'all go
to high school with Ilsa?

16:46.568 --> 16:47.797
Yup, at Lake Side.

16:48.261 --> 16:50.225
That's fancy.

16:51.987 --> 16:54.219
Does that mean you're
all going to Harvard...

16:54.309 --> 16:56.745
...with Ilsa and the Tokyo Twins?

16:57.307 --> 17:00.187
I'm number three
on the wait list, actually.

17:00.798 --> 17:02.395
My parents are pissed.

17:02.706 --> 17:03.777
I'm number nine.

17:04.059 --> 17:05.305
Well, that's a wake up call.

17:05.772 --> 17:07.096
It's nice, you know.

17:07.185 --> 17:08.819
All of us getting together like this...

17:08.910 --> 17:10.143
...before heading off to school.

17:10.233 --> 17:11.566
Yes! True!

17:11.891 --> 17:13.517
-Thanks, Dom.
-Thanks, Dominic.

17:13.915 --> 17:15.528
Fuck you, guys.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.818
I'll kick your asses right
out of here, I swear to God.

17:20.501 --> 17:23.826
I don't know nobody that
I went to high school with...

17:24.516 --> 17:26.199
...now that that's over.

17:28.692 --> 17:29.723
They're all dead.

17:31.493 --> 17:32.573
You say they're dead?

17:33.628 --> 17:34.635
What?

17:37.222 --> 17:38.420
All your friends are dead?

17:41.132 --> 17:42.147
They're off...

17:43.285 --> 17:44.285
Whatever.

17:45.340 --> 17:46.340
Dead to you.

17:46.673 --> 17:49.965
Yeah. Yes, man.

17:50.282 --> 17:52.805
Eli gets it. Thank you, dude.

18:08.752 --> 18:10.117
Have you tried all the eyes?

18:11.727 --> 18:14.676
iPod, iPhone, iPad...

18:18.892 --> 18:20.583
I feel like I should be offended.

18:20.844 --> 18:21.891
Oh, I just remembered.

18:21.981 --> 18:24.369
I got an old Playstation
upstairs in the master bedroom.

18:24.465 --> 18:25.525
-Playstation!
-Is it three?

18:25.615 --> 18:27.679
-No, two, but I got Vice City.
-Yes.

18:27.769 --> 18:30.489
-No zombie box.
-Boys and video games, I swear.

18:30.579 --> 18:31.957
We could play a game.

18:32.047 --> 18:33.578
Like a non-video game.

18:34.064 --> 18:35.893
-Oh, yeah?
-Like what?

18:36.771 --> 18:38.382
We could play Dead Body.

18:38.566 --> 18:39.880
No video games.

18:39.970 --> 18:41.731
For real. My foot is down.

18:41.821 --> 18:45.900
Baby, it's a PS2, they don't even
make those anymore.

18:46.018 --> 18:48.214
No, Dead Body's not a video game.

18:48.304 --> 18:49.946
It's like an old parlour game.

18:51.715 --> 18:54.115
Lame. Seriously.

18:54.205 --> 18:56.473
No, come on. It sounds like fun.

18:56.870 --> 18:57.957
Okay, so?

18:58.361 --> 19:00.022
What do we do? Rules.

19:00.736 --> 19:03.347
Okay, one of us is secretly the killer

19:03.828 --> 19:06.891
and after I count to three
and hit the lights,

19:07.042 --> 19:08.073
everyone hides.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.737
Once a minute passes,
the murderer sneaks around...

19:11.827 --> 19:14.978
...and if he or she pinches you,
you're out.

19:15.068 --> 19:17.425
And if you find the victim
you called out "dead body!"

19:17.895 --> 19:20.339
Or the murder could
call it out and play innocent.

19:20.502 --> 19:22.643
And then we all
regroup and argue about...

19:22.733 --> 19:24.471
...who we think the killer is.

19:24.842 --> 19:25.924
Get it?

19:26.337 --> 19:29.090
You guys, I'm surprised to be intrigued.

19:29.873 --> 19:32.008
What happens if your
falsely accuse someone?

19:32.465 --> 19:34.680
You're dead. You're out.

19:35.648 --> 19:38.472
You know, it's perfect. I'm into it.

19:38.727 --> 19:40.671
Rumor, don't touch me though, seriously.

19:40.803 --> 19:41.998
That's what I'm talking about.

19:42.088 --> 19:43.264
Beats Playstation, right?

19:45.321 --> 19:47.170
The countdown starts
once I turn the light off.

19:47.464 --> 19:49.247
After that, watch your backs.

19:49.692 --> 19:52.299
One. Two. Three.

19:54.842 --> 19:56.266
No following.

19:56.500 --> 19:57.928
Come on, Ilsa.

19:58.476 --> 20:00.087
That's what the killer would say.

20:39.079 --> 20:40.726
You're just supposed to say "dead body."

20:40.816 --> 20:43.143
-You don't have to scream and stuff.
-Fuck you.

20:43.233 --> 20:44.594
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:44.684 --> 20:46.062
Calm down.

20:47.024 --> 20:49.381
What's he doing with ketchup
all over his neck anyway?

20:49.695 --> 20:52.005
Wait, Sarah, did you see
who tried to kill Kenji?

20:52.378 --> 20:54.970
I saw someone bolt
right before I screamed.

20:55.060 --> 20:56.953
-Who?
-I vote Marcus.

20:58.595 --> 21:00.267
-Yeah.
-It's that face.

21:00.357 --> 21:02.261
You're looking around at everyone.

21:02.683 --> 21:04.336
I'm fucking trying to figure out who's...

21:04.426 --> 21:06.087
What's Eli doing the whole time?

21:06.177 --> 21:08.781
Okay. Okay.

21:08.882 --> 21:11.500
All right.
Can we just do another round...

21:11.590 --> 21:13.113
...and get this thing over with please?

21:13.526 --> 21:15.383
Okay, okay.

21:15.832 --> 21:18.103
One. Two. Three.

21:30.194 --> 21:33.074
No way, Mariko, it's way
too creepy down there.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.328
Mariko?

23:12.107 --> 23:13.107
Mariko?

23:19.018 --> 23:21.506
You guys! You guys!

23:22.038 --> 23:23.672
Jesus, Sarah.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.666
This game's really getting to you, huh?

23:28.221 --> 23:29.190
The fuck happened?

23:29.280 --> 23:30.889
I was just down there in the dark...

23:30.979 --> 23:32.623
...and something really weird
was going on.

23:32.713 --> 23:33.868
Mariko was acting...

23:34.408 --> 23:36.598
-Where is she? Mariko!
-Sarah!

23:37.353 --> 23:39.102
It's just the game getting in your head.

23:39.192 --> 23:41.876
Yeah. Besides, I think her
and Kenji are in the bedroom.

23:42.383 --> 23:43.400
You know.

23:44.250 --> 23:45.480
No fucking way.

23:45.873 --> 23:47.341
And I didn't hear any Playstation...

23:47.431 --> 23:48.696
...when I walked by their room.

23:49.026 --> 23:50.105
No, that I was...

23:50.195 --> 23:52.761
That's actually my room, but whatever.

23:52.851 --> 23:54.604
Japanese people are always fucking.

23:55.696 --> 23:56.696
Whatever.

23:56.943 --> 23:59.315
-Sarah.
-Don't defend here, Ilsa.

23:59.405 --> 24:01.785
She always ditches me to go have sex.

24:02.155 --> 24:04.528
Mariko's spoken English isn't that great.

24:04.679 --> 24:07.029
She probably said something
and you didn't understand her.

24:07.119 --> 24:08.361
You always take her side.

24:09.543 --> 24:11.001
Inconsiderate bitch!

24:16.710 --> 24:20.330
-She's fiery.
-Okay, look, can we just drink?

24:20.783 --> 24:24.111
This game's not working and I
lost my buzz a long time ago.

24:24.201 --> 24:25.203
Come on.

24:29.888 --> 24:31.815
We haven't even given it a chance yet.

24:32.268 --> 24:34.199
-Bring on round three!
-Yeah!

24:34.462 --> 24:35.485
Dwayne.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.143
Yeah, maybe we'll
actually get somewhere...

24:38.233 --> 24:40.397
...without little Miss Downer
and the foreigners.

24:40.964 --> 24:42.621
Okay. Okay.

24:43.307 --> 24:45.532
One. Two. Three.

24:49.993 --> 24:51.121
What? Go.

25:05.186 --> 25:06.197
Shit.

25:09.220 --> 25:10.229
Nothing.

25:37.680 --> 25:40.668
Sorry, guys. I hope you're finished.

25:56.329 --> 25:57.337
Huh?

26:01.677 --> 26:06.659
Dead bodies! Dead bodies! Dead bodies!

26:07.496 --> 26:10.890
-Ilsa! Are you okay?
-Dead bodies! Dead bodies!

26:10.980 --> 26:12.353
Dead bodies!

26:20.880 --> 26:21.988
What the fuck?

26:28.586 --> 26:29.748
This is a trick, right?

26:33.782 --> 26:37.581
-Rumor, are you behind this?
-Oh, God, no.

26:38.456 --> 26:40.188
-Mariko.
-It's not a trick?

26:42.473 --> 26:43.566
Dwayne, what are you doing?

26:44.902 --> 26:47.492
What am I doing?
Calling 911, you little shits!

26:47.612 --> 26:49.021
There's no cell reception.

26:49.111 --> 26:51.077
Call! Do something! Fuck!

27:10.030 --> 27:11.040
Thanks, Rumor.

27:14.849 --> 27:15.893
Rumor?

27:18.547 --> 27:19.569
What is it?

27:21.048 --> 27:22.426
All three of them,

27:23.712 --> 27:26.551
he killed all three of them at once.

27:27.786 --> 27:28.789
How?

27:29.757 --> 27:31.650
All right, move.

27:31.740 --> 27:33.467
I got Eli's shovel.

27:33.648 --> 27:35.118
I got a hacksaw.

27:35.658 --> 27:36.691
A knife.

27:36.911 --> 27:38.371
I got two flashlights.

27:39.278 --> 27:42.082
I got a hammer, a hook...

27:43.224 --> 27:44.296
...and a nail gun.

27:49.925 --> 27:51.496
Grab a weapon! We're under attack!

27:52.404 --> 27:53.753
-I call that nail gun.
-No.

27:55.945 --> 27:57.138
Nail gun's mine, Eli.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.143
You brought the damn shovel, take that.

28:01.233 --> 28:02.629
I'll trade it for the knife then.

28:03.102 --> 28:05.670
No. No. The knife is Ilsa's.

28:06.433 --> 28:12.707
Guys, just barricade every door
and stand guard at a window.

28:12.797 --> 28:13.966
Okay, it's simple.

28:14.056 --> 28:15.457
We'll wait till it's light out...

28:15.547 --> 28:16.917
...and we can go down to my car.

28:17.068 --> 28:19.639
I saw a sheriff's office
like three hours back.

28:20.068 --> 28:21.781
Fuck that! Let's go there now!

28:21.901 --> 28:24.310
Now? Now? While it's dark out?

28:24.431 --> 28:25.808
And a killer's on the loose?

28:25.898 --> 28:27.632
And some tools that I found?

28:28.028 --> 28:29.060
Fuck that, man.

28:29.524 --> 28:33.002
Oh, no! Sarah! Sarah's out there!
We have to grab her!

28:33.092 --> 28:34.803
Hey, guys! What?

28:34.893 --> 28:37.535
Easy, Dwayne.
I'm just trying to figure out...

28:37.625 --> 28:39.063
Figure out what?

28:39.153 --> 28:42.267
This isn't a mystery, asshole!
The game is over!

28:42.601 --> 28:45.474
The window is closed and locked.

28:45.886 --> 28:48.127
There's no way the killer
could've gotten out that way.

28:48.218 --> 28:51.654
Dude, seriously, who the fuck cares?

28:51.963 --> 28:55.443
Just grab a weapon, pick one
and hunker your ass down.

28:55.533 --> 28:57.215
-But that means...
-No, wait!

28:57.368 --> 28:58.888
The killer could still be in the house.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.320
Let's find the fucker!

30:55.911 --> 30:58.187
Jesus Christ, Rumor.

31:07.361 --> 31:08.441
No one here, guys!

31:08.854 --> 31:09.854
House cleared.

31:10.047 --> 31:11.047
Hey!

31:11.333 --> 31:12.853
Make sure those windows are shut tight.

31:13.443 --> 31:14.963
Maybe those dumb fucks found something.

31:36.234 --> 31:37.234
Rumor.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.230
Oh, God.

31:39.460 --> 31:40.460
Look.

31:40.768 --> 31:41.768
Mariko.

31:45.036 --> 31:46.036
What happened?

31:47.998 --> 31:52.751
I think we found where Mariko was killed.

32:00.512 --> 32:04.350
So he didn't kill all
three of them at once.

32:05.282 --> 32:07.386
The bastard killed Mariko...

32:07.476 --> 32:10.262
...and dragged her out that door...

32:10.655 --> 32:12.653
...and up the latter to Dominic's room.

32:13.411 --> 32:14.411
Why?

32:14.727 --> 32:16.220
I don't know, but when he got there...

32:16.310 --> 32:18.281
he must've found Kenji,
so he strangled him...

32:19.082 --> 32:21.311
and then when the killer
was hiding the bodies,

32:21.401 --> 32:22.761
Dominic must have walked in on him.

32:23.174 --> 32:27.011
Right. Because Dominic had the only key.

32:27.732 --> 32:29.367
But why go through all the trouble...

32:29.521 --> 32:30.980
of carrying Mariko up there?

32:32.496 --> 32:34.059
I don't know. To hide her?

32:34.149 --> 32:35.838
Motherfucking Hardy Boys over here.

32:36.544 --> 32:37.493
I'm going upstairs...

32:37.583 --> 32:39.777
...and anybody who wants to live
through the night can come with me.

32:39.867 --> 32:40.867
End of story!

32:57.758 --> 32:59.801
But Dwayne, what I am saying...

32:59.892 --> 33:03.155
...is that someone is playing
the game for real with us!

33:03.245 --> 33:05.260
Don't care. Eli, grab that end.

33:05.452 --> 33:07.241
And they came from the inside

33:07.343 --> 33:09.268
and the window is still locked.

33:09.653 --> 33:13.097
Which means it's more
likely that it's one of us.

33:18.513 --> 33:22.054
Okay. Okay. Okay, let
me get this straight.

33:23.215 --> 33:27.069
You think that one of
us just got carried away

33:27.197 --> 33:29.214
and started killing people?

33:29.336 --> 33:30.392
That's idiotic!

33:30.860 --> 33:32.170
And you think what?

33:32.339 --> 33:35.117
Some lunatic lives in the
woods in the middle of nowhere...

33:35.772 --> 33:38.224
...waiting for us to play
a game called Dead Body,

33:38.314 --> 33:40.378
and then sneaks in and starts killing us...

33:40.568 --> 33:42.127
...without anyone seeing them?

33:42.217 --> 33:43.253
That's idiotic!

33:43.588 --> 33:45.866
And why didn't Dominic, Mariko or Kenji

33:45.956 --> 33:47.550
scream when they saw a total stranger?

33:48.020 --> 33:51.321
-It has to be one...
-It could've been a homeless nut...

33:51.605 --> 33:52.534
...living out here...

33:52.624 --> 33:55.256
...or a squatter.

33:55.346 --> 33:56.346
It's not us!

33:56.507 --> 33:57.394
That's crazy.

33:57.522 --> 34:00.071
The house was spotless.

34:00.350 --> 34:03.459
There was no signs of life,
no signs of a break-in.

34:03.549 --> 34:04.549
Stop!

34:05.525 --> 34:06.846
We have to get out of here!

34:06.936 --> 34:08.482
-Ilsa!
-Wait, Ilsa, just hang on.

34:09.588 --> 34:11.003
Even if it's one of these guys,

34:11.092 --> 34:12.328
we can't all head out into the woods...

34:12.418 --> 34:13.402
...if one of them is a killer.

34:13.493 --> 34:14.815
You and I will go alone.

34:14.985 --> 34:15.985
Really?

34:16.658 --> 34:17.658
And Dwayne.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.237
Oh, gee, thanks, Hun.

34:19.915 --> 34:21.554
Hey! What about the rest of us?

34:22.297 --> 34:23.692
Why would we take you?

34:23.782 --> 34:25.382
You're the one whose idea it was to play!

34:25.588 --> 34:26.529
What's that prove?

34:26.619 --> 34:28.937
It's so obviously Dwayne!

34:29.027 --> 34:30.420
Dwayne!

34:30.511 --> 34:31.551
Son of a bitch!

34:33.054 --> 34:34.495
Are you guys seeing this?

34:34.585 --> 34:35.746
You're blaming us?

34:35.835 --> 34:37.289
I ought to put a nail in your head!

34:39.318 --> 34:40.565
Don't you do it.

34:42.268 --> 34:43.268
Let him go.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.862
Put the nail gun down.

34:51.139 --> 34:52.485
Fuck you, son of a bitch.

34:57.985 --> 34:59.324
Guys, we have to calm down.

34:59.414 --> 35:01.761
Even if one of us is the killer.

35:03.021 --> 35:04.847
They can't possibly
take all of us at once.

35:04.937 --> 35:06.227
So let's just talk.

35:08.229 --> 35:09.229
Yeah.

35:09.537 --> 35:10.628
Yeah, let's talk.

35:11.509 --> 35:13.022
Let's talk about this.

35:14.291 --> 35:15.709
You were stoking Mariko.

35:15.799 --> 35:18.045
What the hell? Give me back my journal.

35:18.660 --> 35:20.040
Let's see.

35:20.130 --> 35:23.345
"I followed Mariko to the
Egyptian Theater that day."

35:23.714 --> 35:26.634
"When she came out of the
movie, she was so alive,"

35:26.808 --> 35:28.265
"so full of spirit."

35:28.840 --> 35:33.278
"It wrenched my heart open to
see Kenji walk out after her."

35:33.896 --> 35:34.896
Rumor?

35:36.989 --> 35:38.442
Yes, okay?

35:39.700 --> 35:41.767
I had feelings for her.

35:42.710 --> 35:45.655
But then why would I do this?

35:46.079 --> 35:47.913
It must have killed you...

35:48.382 --> 35:51.057
...to watch them constantly
go off to fuck.

35:51.944 --> 35:53.834
Yeah, you couldn't take it anymore,

35:54.521 --> 35:56.330
so you snuck in while they were fucking...

35:56.669 --> 35:57.949
...and killed them both.

35:59.230 --> 36:00.673
That's insane!

36:01.163 --> 36:02.408
Yeah, maybe.

36:02.498 --> 36:04.153
Except, Dominic saw you too, right?

36:04.243 --> 36:05.561
And you killed him!

36:05.651 --> 36:06.827
That's why you told Sarah...

36:06.917 --> 36:08.555
...to stay out of Kenji
and Mariko's room.

36:09.429 --> 36:11.710
You said they were fucking but
you didn't want her to see.

36:11.868 --> 36:13.020
That proves nothing.

36:13.767 --> 36:16.049
Put your personal
feelings away and think.

36:17.206 --> 36:18.206
Who could have done this?

36:18.992 --> 36:20.490
It's simple.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.595
If it was one of us,

36:23.099 --> 36:25.149
it's most likely it
wasn't someone we knew

36:25.368 --> 36:27.251
our entire lives.

36:27.408 --> 36:30.629
Which means Dwayne or...

36:38.784 --> 36:39.851
Somebody there?

36:57.271 --> 36:58.307
Creepy.

37:19.667 --> 37:24.667
Let me in!

37:27.167 --> 37:29.429
You guys, there's someone out here!

37:33.640 --> 37:35.099
You guys, I think I saw a guy out there!

37:35.189 --> 37:36.229
You have to come see this.

37:37.651 --> 37:38.658
Are you guys okay?

37:39.242 --> 37:41.133
I saw her go downstairs with Mariko.

37:41.382 --> 37:42.276
That's right, she did.

37:42.377 --> 37:43.275
She killed her in cold blood.

37:43.365 --> 37:46.031
And then she came up to pretend she
was angry and she stormed off.

37:46.121 --> 37:47.950
Then she came back to stash their bodies.

37:48.041 --> 37:48.930
Bodies?

37:49.021 --> 37:50.240
How did she get back outside?

37:50.330 --> 37:52.214
The windows are locked
and shut from the inside.

37:52.304 --> 37:53.273
Maybe she slipped out

37:53.363 --> 37:54.864
while Ilsa was hiding in the bedroom.

37:54.992 --> 37:56.536
She locked the door from the inside,

37:56.626 --> 37:58.002
closed it behind her, done.

37:58.092 --> 37:59.288
So obvious.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.474
Jesus, you guys are getting
way too into this game.

38:01.564 --> 38:02.680
I have a real problem.

38:02.770 --> 38:03.642
Yeah, you sure do.

38:03.732 --> 38:04.857
Don't worry, Sarah.

38:05.585 --> 38:07.231
We just have questions.

38:08.311 --> 38:09.229
Don't.

38:09.319 --> 38:10.906
You guys are scaring me, stop!

38:10.996 --> 38:15.143
Stop! Guys, knock it off! Assholes!

38:15.238 --> 38:16.238
Ilsa!

38:17.602 --> 38:18.922
Put her in the bedroom.

38:19.196 --> 38:20.346
With the bodies?

38:20.792 --> 38:22.512
Guys, no! You can't put her in there!

38:22.602 --> 38:23.506
What the hell!

38:23.596 --> 38:24.571
Put me down!

38:24.661 --> 38:26.815
Stop, it's not funny. Put me down!

38:26.905 --> 38:28.674
Oh, my God, is that real?

38:28.767 --> 38:29.639
What's happening?

38:29.730 --> 38:31.440
Ilsa! What's happening?

38:31.530 --> 38:33.185
No, don't! Stop it!

38:33.275 --> 38:34.329
What the fuck?

38:34.419 --> 38:35.581
Eli, stop it!

38:35.671 --> 38:37.600
-We good?
-Oh, my God, no!

38:37.691 --> 38:38.988
Don't leave me in here!

38:39.078 --> 38:40.659
Don't leave me in here! Stop it!

38:40.749 --> 38:43.999
Let her out! Dwayne, we could
just watch her! Marcus, help me!

38:44.089 --> 38:45.534
Ilsa's right,
you can't just lock her in there!

38:45.624 --> 38:47.178
-Let her out!
-No! No!

38:47.268 --> 38:48.730
This is a life or death situation.

38:48.820 --> 38:50.804
If she's a threat, she
needs to be dealt with.

38:51.106 --> 38:52.506
I think it's for the best, guys.

38:52.824 --> 38:54.700
She'll be fine while we hash things out.

38:54.959 --> 38:55.927
No! No!

38:56.017 --> 38:56.953
Get the fuck back!

38:57.043 --> 38:58.043
I mean it!

38:58.592 --> 38:59.592
Let me out!

39:02.090 --> 39:03.774
Rumor, give up that hacksaw.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.194
Eli, get the hacksaw!

39:05.284 --> 39:06.284
Let me out!

39:07.194 --> 39:08.045
Let me out!

39:08.135 --> 39:09.597
Give it up!

39:11.987 --> 39:15.007
Man, why the violence?

39:15.632 --> 39:17.588
Seriously, let's discuss.

39:18.190 --> 39:20.645
Let me out of here!

39:21.345 --> 39:22.381
All right.

39:22.471 --> 39:23.941
In the living room, move!

39:24.031 --> 39:26.053
-What if she's innocent?
-What if she's not?

39:26.356 --> 39:28.233
Please, let me out of here!

39:28.323 --> 39:31.179
Five minutes, then you'll
have to shoot me full of nails!

39:31.269 --> 39:32.427
Go.

39:37.660 --> 39:38.605
Don't look.

39:38.695 --> 39:40.133
Don't look. Don't look. Don't look.

39:44.900 --> 39:46.337
Guys, let me out!

39:46.605 --> 39:47.605
Let me out!

39:47.808 --> 39:48.808
She'll be fine.

39:49.433 --> 39:50.433
Okay?

39:51.071 --> 39:53.379
Okay, let's just figure this out.

39:54.222 --> 39:57.046
In round two, she went
downstairs with Mariko.

39:57.196 --> 39:58.196
Period.

39:58.509 --> 40:01.257
If Mariko died down there, which she did,

40:01.944 --> 40:04.524
it's a little funny that
nothing was mentioned,

40:04.614 --> 40:05.574
don't you think?

40:05.665 --> 40:06.549
Exactly.

40:06.639 --> 40:08.011
Rumor, are you buying any of this?

40:08.101 --> 40:09.687
I hate to say it, but Dwayne's right.

40:10.146 --> 40:11.095
Thank you.

40:11.185 --> 40:13.200
Thank you, Rumor, of all people.

40:13.662 --> 40:18.017
Do we forget how pissed off
she was about them having sex?

40:18.140 --> 40:21.679
She got so mad that she killed Mariko.

40:21.838 --> 40:22.933
All right?

40:23.023 --> 40:24.864
She goes outside for a walk...

40:24.954 --> 40:26.388
...and drags the body to the bedroom,

40:26.478 --> 40:28.269
she's Kenji and kills him too.

40:28.359 --> 40:29.704
Then Dominic comes in...

40:29.794 --> 40:32.253
...because he's the only one with the key
and she killed him too.

40:32.343 --> 40:33.949
-No witnesses.
-No!

40:34.039 --> 40:35.159
That's crazy!

40:35.364 --> 40:36.436
It's Sarah!

40:36.527 --> 40:37.527
Why would she do that?

40:37.655 --> 40:40.602
Why would she kill three people?

40:41.247 --> 40:43.813
And just five minutes ago
you thought it was rumor.

40:44.219 --> 40:46.700
That was before we knew she
was sulking around out there.

40:47.212 --> 40:48.817
In the perfect position to do this.

40:48.907 --> 40:51.332
I mean, what do we really know about her?

40:51.422 --> 40:55.503
She did go to juvie for
pointing a knife at another kid.

40:56.659 --> 40:59.532
She used to cut herself.

41:00.030 --> 41:01.482
Like, pretty deep.

41:02.812 --> 41:04.381
And she does have these moods.

41:06.151 --> 41:07.790
I know Sarah.

41:08.182 --> 41:10.998
Besides, Dwayne, you've
been to juvie too!

41:11.121 --> 41:12.083
For what?

41:12.173 --> 41:14.761
Eli, you're always whacked out on drugs.

41:14.851 --> 41:17.460
Plus, Eli, you said
that the knife in Mariko...

41:17.550 --> 41:18.671
...was an oyster shucker.

41:18.761 --> 41:20.475
-How did you know that?
-Guys, knock it off.

41:20.610 --> 41:24.719
And Rumor, you've always
had weird tendencies.

41:25.423 --> 41:28.339
Everyone used to say you lost
your finger in a knife fight.

41:28.429 --> 41:30.439
I lost it in a car accident!

41:30.573 --> 41:32.301
And while we're at it, Ilsa,

41:32.391 --> 41:34.910
how did you get in the
bedroom with no key?

41:35.000 --> 41:37.523
-Watch it, Rumor!
-I used my credit card!

41:37.613 --> 41:38.630
Okay!

41:39.998 --> 41:40.998
Fair enough.

41:41.551 --> 41:44.609
Sarah is our prime suspect,
but it could be any of us.

41:44.699 --> 41:46.627
So why are we putting
her through this hell?

41:46.717 --> 41:50.278
Exactly. If we're wrong, she
doesn't deserve to be locked up...

41:50.368 --> 41:51.782
...in a room with bodies.

41:51.872 --> 41:54.587
Maybe she made bodies of those people.

41:55.053 --> 41:56.687
Of your friends, okay?

41:58.334 --> 41:59.444
You're right.

41:59.535 --> 42:00.518
We should move her.

42:00.608 --> 42:03.090
Maybe we could find a door
that locks from the outside.

42:03.870 --> 42:05.088
Let's check the basement.

42:06.018 --> 42:08.265
I saw a supply closet down there.

42:08.680 --> 42:09.680
Fine.

42:10.130 --> 42:11.381
Fine, but we're tying her up.

42:11.936 --> 42:12.936
Gonna go find some rope.

42:13.199 --> 42:14.219
I'll give you a hand.

42:17.013 --> 42:18.013
Ilsa?

42:19.948 --> 42:20.948
Don't let her out, okay?

42:22.374 --> 42:23.374
Not yet.

42:24.800 --> 42:25.800
Just in case.

43:04.696 --> 43:05.696
Sarah?

43:15.258 --> 43:16.498
Fuck this.

44:33.653 --> 44:34.653
Eli?

44:35.911 --> 44:36.911
Is that you?

44:53.072 --> 44:54.450
Oh, my God!

44:57.044 --> 44:58.044
They got Eli.

45:02.341 --> 45:03.378
Rumor, no.

45:06.261 --> 45:07.238
I should've known.

45:07.328 --> 45:10.010
No, no, no! I found him like this.

45:10.851 --> 45:13.730
You guys got it all wrong.
I picked up the hacksaw for protection...

45:13.820 --> 45:16.081
...in case the killer was still here!

45:18.677 --> 45:20.769
There's no proof!

45:21.394 --> 45:22.420
Think about it.

45:23.443 --> 45:24.466
There's motive.

45:25.268 --> 45:26.268
Jealousy.

45:27.050 --> 45:29.394
We all know you were obsessed
with Mariko...

45:30.626 --> 45:32.393
...and you brought up the game.

45:33.560 --> 45:36.553
You were the one who told us
not to go into the bedroom...

45:36.643 --> 45:38.616
...because Kenji and Mariko were fucking.

45:39.922 --> 45:41.928
And you had the hacksaw earlier!

45:42.187 --> 45:43.477
You've always been off.

45:44.295 --> 45:45.866
You brought that knife to seventh grade.

45:46.273 --> 45:47.939
That was Dominic's.

45:48.061 --> 45:50.215
I just go caught with it
when he showed it to me.

45:50.305 --> 45:51.647
Marcus, tell them!

45:56.356 --> 45:57.861
Rumor, we don't wanna hurt you.

45:59.781 --> 46:01.028
We just wanna talk.

46:01.498 --> 46:02.468
Come on.

46:02.558 --> 46:04.866
Marcus, it's me.

46:08.525 --> 46:09.561
It's us.

46:14.501 --> 46:15.571
Just come inside, Rumor.

46:16.948 --> 46:18.210
Guys, okay, come on.

46:18.311 --> 46:19.394
This is crazy.

46:21.808 --> 46:23.125
Dwayne's the neanderthal.

46:23.215 --> 46:25.294
He's the one with a record!

46:26.171 --> 46:27.931
-Dwayne, what the hell?
-Get off!

46:30.019 --> 46:31.151
Dwayne, don't hurt him!

46:33.769 --> 46:34.873
Marcus, I'm sorry.

46:35.465 --> 46:36.474
No, I'm sorry.

46:36.564 --> 46:37.564
I'm sorry.

46:38.199 --> 46:39.199
You're right.

46:40.461 --> 46:43.170
The two of us can trust each other
and that's about it.

46:43.613 --> 46:46.307
Let's get the gear and the flashlights...

46:46.397 --> 46:48.209
...and run to the vans as fast as we can.

46:48.354 --> 46:49.425
Rumor's out there.

46:49.720 --> 46:52.169
I know! I know! I know!

46:54.483 --> 46:55.910
It doesn't make sense.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.685
Rumor is not a killer.

46:57.775 --> 46:58.867
He is not a killer.

47:00.148 --> 47:01.875
-Dwayne?
-I don't know.

47:04.311 --> 47:06.147
I have known Rumor my entire life

47:09.141 --> 47:12.209
and I let him run off
into the woods alone.

47:14.001 --> 47:15.695
Fuck. God, Rumor!

47:15.790 --> 47:16.957
Marcus, wait!

48:00.468 --> 48:01.519
Marcus?

48:05.027 --> 48:06.033
Dwayne?

48:12.335 --> 48:13.463
Rumor?

49:30.115 --> 49:31.171
Ilsa?

49:32.395 --> 49:33.417
Is that you?

49:46.455 --> 49:47.705
No!

49:49.179 --> 49:50.270
Please.

50:35.475 --> 50:36.485
Oh, God!

50:37.001 --> 50:38.020
Ilsa!

50:39.598 --> 50:41.184
-Are you okay?
-He attacked me!

50:41.274 --> 50:42.261
He came after me!

50:42.351 --> 50:43.447
Who was it?

50:43.537 --> 50:44.817
I don't know, I couldn't see him.

50:44.997 --> 50:46.946
No! No! Please don't
leave me again, please.

50:47.043 --> 50:48.596
No, I'll stay right here.

50:51.084 --> 50:52.261
Let's just get back inside.

50:53.644 --> 50:55.145
No, listen, Marcus. You're right.

50:55.235 --> 50:56.593
Only we two can trust each other.

50:56.683 --> 50:58.428
Let's just get to the car and get out.

51:08.065 --> 51:09.065
What happened?

51:10.064 --> 51:11.064
Did you?

51:16.202 --> 51:17.202
I lost him.

51:17.406 --> 51:18.960
Good because he's not the killer.

51:19.813 --> 51:20.948
Who is then?

51:21.038 --> 51:22.664
Whoever it was, he just came after me.

51:24.907 --> 51:27.007
Sarah! I'm letting her out!

51:30.522 --> 51:31.725
Thank God you didn't find him.

52:00.045 --> 52:01.540
No, she must have found the key.

52:04.700 --> 52:05.996
Maybe Mariko had it.

52:13.681 --> 52:14.690
It was Sarah.

52:17.497 --> 52:18.762
Fuck it, let's get to the car!

52:33.392 --> 52:34.429
Rumor!

52:36.539 --> 52:37.691
Rumor!

52:40.536 --> 52:41.556
Rumor!

52:42.797 --> 52:43.807
Rumor!

52:45.900 --> 52:47.144
-Rumor!
-Hey.

52:48.838 --> 52:50.579
It's probably another mile or two.

52:51.525 --> 52:53.650
From now on, we all watch
each other's backs, okay?

52:54.194 --> 52:55.726
Kill anything that isn't us.

52:56.075 --> 52:58.288
We have to find Rumor
before the killer does.

52:59.764 --> 53:00.773
Come on.

53:26.944 --> 53:28.740
Rumor, no!

53:29.142 --> 53:30.603
No! No! Rumor, no!

53:33.913 --> 53:36.436
Please, please, please.

53:42.060 --> 53:44.981
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

53:53.192 --> 53:54.213
We have to go.

53:55.664 --> 53:56.989
I wanted to save him.

54:00.716 --> 54:02.585
-Oh, my God, we have to go!
-No!

54:02.751 --> 54:03.870
-Marcus!
-Marcus!

54:05.188 --> 54:06.239
We have to go!

54:07.483 --> 54:08.523
Go! Go! Ilsa, go!

54:17.130 --> 54:18.138
Fuck.

54:19.726 --> 54:21.459
You can't do this right now, Marcus.

54:22.923 --> 54:23.966
It's not your fault.

54:25.950 --> 54:26.997
I just...

54:31.765 --> 54:32.843
I'm supposed to save him.

54:33.018 --> 54:34.267
Oh, Jesus Christ.

54:35.499 --> 54:37.348
Fuck it. We're almost there. Let's go.

54:47.959 --> 54:48.960
Oh, my God.

54:49.887 --> 54:52.023
I never thought I'd be so
happy to see my mom's van.

54:54.227 --> 54:55.281
Stop.

54:58.112 --> 54:59.188
Somebody broke in.

55:06.761 --> 55:08.661
You guys! You guys!

55:09.216 --> 55:11.213
It's not me! I know who it is.

55:11.324 --> 55:12.630
I can prove it. It's...

55:21.401 --> 55:22.443
Oh, my God.

55:22.920 --> 55:23.921
Oh, my God.

55:26.017 --> 55:27.166
Dwayne, what the fuck?

55:28.436 --> 55:29.978
She was trying to tell us something!

55:30.427 --> 55:32.427
She's the fucking murderer!

55:37.706 --> 55:39.223
She was trying to hot wire the car.

55:41.788 --> 55:43.341
Let me guess, you can't get it started.

55:45.465 --> 55:46.858
Just get out of there! Let me try!

55:51.448 --> 55:53.810
-Oh, my God.
-Hey.

55:54.074 --> 55:57.365
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm all right.

56:18.458 --> 56:19.581
The fucking bitch!

56:22.613 --> 56:24.836
Oh, my God. Sarah.

56:26.696 --> 56:30.197
And Dominic and Mariko and Kenji.
Oh, my God.

56:36.436 --> 56:37.527
-I hit him.
-Who?

56:39.391 --> 56:40.474
The killer.

56:41.769 --> 56:44.609
I found a branch, pulled it back
and hit him in the face.

56:57.297 --> 56:58.312
Dwayne?

57:01.027 --> 57:02.907
You didn't find Rumor
out in the woods, did you?

57:03.054 --> 57:05.005
No, I already told you that.

57:06.582 --> 57:08.208
Goddamn, she fucked this up!

57:08.447 --> 57:10.650
Those scratched on your
face, how did you get those?

57:10.864 --> 57:13.165
Trees and shit, man. What do you think?

57:14.809 --> 57:15.812
What?

57:19.265 --> 57:20.274
What?

57:22.314 --> 57:23.977
Oh, you don't believe me all of a sudden?

57:24.071 --> 57:25.081
Is that it?

57:25.308 --> 57:26.330
Yeah, I see that.

57:26.651 --> 57:28.426
You guys make quite
the couple, don't you?

57:29.740 --> 57:31.459
Dwayne, we're just
trying to figure this out.

57:31.549 --> 57:32.584
Yeah.

57:33.557 --> 57:35.940
I mean, why were you so against us...

57:36.030 --> 57:37.232
...looking for clues earlier?

57:37.957 --> 57:39.525
You just wanted to barricade the house...

57:39.615 --> 57:40.863
so no one could get in.

57:42.451 --> 57:43.454
Or out.

57:44.013 --> 57:46.189
How could Rumor
or Sarah have carried Mariko...

57:46.279 --> 57:47.450
...up to the second floor?

57:47.951 --> 57:51.296
Oh, nice. Nice. Yeah, yeah.

57:51.386 --> 57:54.183
This is what you wanted from the
beginning, isn't it? Right?

57:54.572 --> 57:58.317
You two are in on this shit
together, aren't you? Aren't you?

57:58.407 --> 58:00.356
Sarah was about to tell
us who the killer was...

58:00.446 --> 58:01.959
...and you shot her in her fucking face.

58:02.049 --> 58:03.446
Are you fucking serious right now?

58:03.545 --> 58:05.291
Are you serious guys?

58:05.979 --> 58:07.849
She was a fucking lunatic!

58:08.194 --> 58:10.048
This is crazy!

58:10.281 --> 58:11.565
We won!

58:11.655 --> 58:12.946
We made it!

59:08.313 --> 59:11.549
Hey. Hey.

59:13.675 --> 59:17.066
It's over. It's all over.

59:23.938 --> 59:24.971
We won.

59:27.766 --> 59:28.788
Thank God!

59:29.592 --> 59:31.964
-We're almost out of here.
-What?

59:33.617 --> 59:34.826
What do you mean, we won?

59:41.215 --> 59:42.488
What do you mean, we won?

59:45.489 --> 59:47.000
I think I can fix this.

59:51.639 --> 59:52.644
The killer?

59:53.735 --> 59:56.652
I think when I hit him the branch.

59:57.659 --> 59:59.472
I think he held up his
arm to protect himself.

01:00:01.981 --> 01:00:04.282
But you ran off.

01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:08.383
There was time to double back.

01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:12.340
Why were you so ready to give up Rumor?

01:00:12.639 --> 01:00:14.448
You've known him your entire life.

01:00:19.888 --> 01:00:20.926
Ilsa?

01:00:27.768 --> 01:00:28.819
You good?

01:00:34.888 --> 01:00:35.934
Hang in there with me.

01:00:39.581 --> 01:00:42.536
I know it's been crazy,
but Dwayne is gone.

01:00:46.001 --> 01:00:47.163
We can get out of here.

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:51.707
Hey, hey, hey. Relax, it's me.

01:00:51.807 --> 01:00:53.128
It's me. It's us.

01:01:20.082 --> 01:01:21.541
If I can't start the car,

01:01:21.886 --> 01:01:23.867
Eli's car's parked half
a mile down the road.

01:01:23.957 --> 01:01:25.123
Dom's is too, I think.

01:01:31.669 --> 01:01:32.766
Okay.

01:01:48.394 --> 01:01:49.476
Yes!

01:02:23.746 --> 01:02:25.438
You fucking psychopath!

01:02:25.715 --> 01:02:27.423
You killed Rumor!

01:05:53.814 --> 01:05:56.970
You? It was you the whole time?

01:05:57.865 --> 01:05:58.899
I win!

01:05:59.866 --> 01:06:01.758
You killed all of them.

01:06:04.133 --> 01:06:05.181
No.

01:06:05.636 --> 01:06:09.068
No, no, no. See, that was your fault.

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:15.272
All I wanted to do was to kill Kenji,
Mariko and you,

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:17.139
clearing the way for me to move...

01:06:17.229 --> 01:06:18.816
...from number three on the wait list...

01:06:18.906 --> 01:06:20.573
...straight into Harvard.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:23.571
I was going to wait until
you all just fell asleep...

01:06:23.661 --> 01:06:25.177
...and then kill you quietly.

01:06:25.267 --> 01:06:29.335
My dad even gave me an
ex-convict to pin everything on.

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.867
I had him tied up to this
tree, until Sarah found him.

01:06:33.095 --> 01:06:36.198
I have everything planned.

01:06:37.192 --> 01:06:38.369
But you...

01:06:39.526 --> 01:06:41.879
...you couldn't go one weekend...

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:44.800
...without being the centre of attention.

01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:46.782
You needed your love triangles...

01:06:46.872 --> 01:06:49.447
...and your high school bullshit.

01:06:49.737 --> 01:06:52.682
So you invited
all the shit birds with you...

01:06:52.943 --> 01:06:55.574
...and you almost fucked everything up!

01:06:56.627 --> 01:07:01.304
But then we started to play Dead Body...

01:07:04.678 --> 01:07:06.105
...and I couldn't resist.

01:07:07.358 --> 01:07:11.136
I had to kill you three...

01:07:11.489 --> 01:07:13.545
...right under their noses.

01:07:14.604 --> 01:07:16.476
As the late Rumor would say,

01:07:17.491 --> 01:07:18.953
"I wanted to play the game for real."

01:07:20.792 --> 01:07:25.038
I waited until round two,
where I strangled Kenji.

01:07:25.851 --> 01:07:27.954
Then I locked the door,
went out the window,

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.801
down the ladder, into the basement...

01:07:29.891 --> 01:07:33.723
...where I stabbed Mariko.

01:07:34.741 --> 01:07:37.220
Oh, my God, my heart was just...

01:07:38.784 --> 01:07:40.966
Like a little hummingbird.

01:07:41.416 --> 01:07:45.356
I was certain that you
knew exactly what I'd done.

01:07:46.421 --> 01:07:47.556
But of course you didn't.

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.489
How is any of this my fault?

01:07:51.844 --> 01:07:54.653
Because of what happened next!

01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:56.695
Oh, my God!

01:07:58.369 --> 01:08:01.370
So I wrapped our little
Japanese flower in a tarp,

01:08:01.773 --> 01:08:03.841
slung her over my shoulder,

01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:05.439
up the ladder, through the window...

01:08:05.529 --> 01:08:07.820
...and plopped her on the bed
with her beloved Kenji.

01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:10.856
I was just about to clean myself up,

01:08:11.104 --> 01:08:14.302
when you came in.

01:08:15.872 --> 01:08:17.256
I was fucked.

01:08:18.557 --> 01:08:19.658
I didn't know what to do.

01:08:19.937 --> 01:08:23.010
So I just smeared some
of Mariko's blood on my neck.

01:08:28.374 --> 01:08:31.585
After you saw me with the bodies,

01:08:31.675 --> 01:08:34.723
I had no choice.

01:08:36.654 --> 01:08:38.157
I had to kill everybody.

01:08:41.839 --> 01:08:43.428
But how? I was trapped.

01:08:43.518 --> 01:08:47.305
I was stuck playing dead
with Kenji and Mariko,

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:49.694
the Tokyo Twins.

01:08:50.022 --> 01:08:51.109
And then,

01:08:52.678 --> 01:08:55.876
Rumor, of all people,

01:08:56.705 --> 01:08:57.709
saved me.

01:08:59.649 --> 01:09:01.817
He threw the sheet over me, remember?

01:09:01.907 --> 01:09:03.678
Oh, my God.

01:09:04.124 --> 01:09:06.343
I almost laughed out loud.

01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:15.207
Don't be a sore loser, sweet pea.

01:09:16.328 --> 01:09:17.901
You haven't heard the whole story.

01:09:20.564 --> 01:09:22.024
From there, covered by a blanket,

01:09:22.115 --> 01:09:25.031
it was a piece of cake.

01:09:26.703 --> 01:09:28.493
A couple of strategically
placed pillows...

01:09:28.584 --> 01:09:30.950
...and voila, like I never even left.

01:09:32.313 --> 01:09:33.627
I think...

01:09:34.679 --> 01:09:36.077
...right about that time,

01:09:36.292 --> 01:09:38.823
you locked Sarah up in the bedroom.

01:09:40.603 --> 01:09:43.220
And then you just started
killing each other.

01:09:43.549 --> 01:09:45.475
And it was...

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.638
Ilsa.

01:09:47.211 --> 01:09:48.622
It was beautiful.

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:49.787
I mean...

01:09:52.649 --> 01:09:53.881
Dwayne killed Sarah.

01:09:54.096 --> 01:09:55.924
You killed Dwayne and just now,

01:09:56.016 --> 01:09:58.265
you ran away from Marcus.

01:09:58.355 --> 01:10:02.486
All he had to do was shit into drive...

01:10:03.547 --> 01:10:04.905
...and step on the gas...

01:10:04.995 --> 01:10:08.021
...and you'd be home free.

01:10:10.541 --> 01:10:13.597
And you, fucker, couldn't
figure any of it out!

01:10:13.923 --> 01:10:15.980
You locked up the one person...

01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:18.213
...who could solve the mystery...

01:10:18.303 --> 01:10:20.627
...and you're the one
getting into Harvard!

01:10:22.813 --> 01:10:24.645
How fucking dare you!

01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:26.902
Fucking murderer!

01:11:00.023 --> 01:11:03.498
Just concede, you fucking bitch! I won!

01:11:26.023 --> 01:11:27.351
Oh, shit.

01:12:04.297 --> 01:12:05.354
Oh, shit.

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.640
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:12:17.557 --> 01:12:18.651
It's okay.

01:12:23.232 --> 01:12:24.609
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.295
Oh, my God!

01:12:30.706 --> 01:12:32.667
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

01:12:34.144 --> 01:12:35.395
I'm so sorry.

01:12:43.197 --> 01:12:44.394
Oh, my God.

01:12:46.668 --> 01:12:47.714
Okay.

01:13:01.641 --> 01:13:03.840
That's not fair, Ilsa.

01:13:06.288 --> 01:13:08.162
That thing's not accurate anyway.

01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:11.442
Face it. It's over.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:16.814
Die, you piece of shit!

01:13:27.792 --> 01:13:29.727
Shit! Oh, my God.

01:13:33.197 --> 01:13:35.956
Bitch! It didn't have to be this way!

01:13:37.017 --> 01:13:39.386
Harvard, that's what this is about.

01:13:40.689 --> 01:13:44.729
-You fucker!
-That's what it was all about,

01:13:44.819 --> 01:13:46.454
but not anymore.

01:13:46.879 --> 01:13:49.424
Now it's all about being the best!

01:13:49.901 --> 01:13:51.150
The winner!

01:14:13.848 --> 01:14:16.741
You're a failure!

01:15:00.824 --> 01:15:02.070
No! No!

01:15:24.843 --> 01:15:26.278
Hurry. Hurry.
