00:01.127 --> 00:03.212
Previously on "11.22.63"...

00:03.213 --> 00:04.440
You shouldn't be here.

00:07.410 --> 00:10.379
- But you got the job?
- Texas School Book Depository.

00:10.380 --> 00:13.339
You shouldn't be staying here.
You should come home with me.

00:13.340 --> 00:16.329
- I have cancer.
- I wish you'd told me sooner.

00:16.329 --> 00:18.269
I'm looking for my brother.

00:18.270 --> 00:20.329
- Na-sa-di-rovie.
- [laughter]

00:20.330 --> 00:22.229
Do you realize how badly

00:22.230 --> 00:23.329
you're messing things up right now?

00:23.330 --> 00:25.329
I love her and she loves me,

00:25.330 --> 00:28.041
and if you get in between me and Marina,

00:28.042 --> 00:30.152
I will tell Lee everything
you've been doing.

00:30.153 --> 00:32.002
Look, I was just at the hospital.

00:32.003 --> 00:33.082
Marina was there.

00:33.083 --> 00:35.012
- She's having the baby right now.
- What?

00:35.013 --> 00:36.212
Bill, she was asking for you.

00:36.213 --> 00:38.012
Is this your brother?

00:38.013 --> 00:39.102
Yes. Yes, sir.

00:39.103 --> 00:40.523
Bill, I'm sorry.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.022
He's not even my fucking brother!

00:45.023 --> 00:47.082
So what kind of odds
can I get on Rodriguez

00:47.083 --> 00:48.142
going all ten rounds?

00:48.143 --> 00:51.102
I guess I could do four-to-one.

00:51.103 --> 00:52.610
I'm in for 800.

00:53.622 --> 00:55.062
I know everything.

00:55.063 --> 00:56.782
The man I was... was following,

00:56.783 --> 00:59.864
I-I know now he... He's acting alone.

00:59.865 --> 01:01.061
Will you marry me?

01:01.062 --> 01:03.063
Come home and I'll give you an answer.

How long's it gonna take
for him to get better?

01:24.093 --> 01:26.153
He's been like this so long.

01:36.618 --> 01:38.232
[muffled TV voices]

01:38.233 --> 01:40.212
So with the President in the room,

01:40.213 --> 01:43.062
she... she knew that
something was coming.

01:43.063 --> 01:45.112
Now, Mike, was there ever a moment

01:45.113 --> 01:46.152
when you thought to
yourself, "You know what?

01:46.153 --> 01:48.032
"I'm not gonna do it this time.

01:48.033 --> 01:50.052
"This is the President
of the United States.

01:50.053 --> 01:52.202
"I'm not gonna... I'm
not gonna embarrass...

01:52.203 --> 01:55.232
Embarrass my girlfriend
in front of him"?

01:55.233 --> 01:58.012
I knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime

01:58.013 --> 02:00.012
- kind of opportunity.
- [medical equipment beeping]

02:00.013 --> 02:03.032
- And then the President...
- [background chatter]

02:03.033 --> 02:05.002
- [indistinct, slo-mo]
- All right.

02:05.003 --> 02:07.003
Wonderful.

02:26.003 --> 02:28.721
Jake, honey, what's wrong?

02:30.023 --> 02:31.131
What year is it?

02:32.063 --> 02:34.043
Maybe I should get the doctor.

02:39.043 --> 02:42.089
You look like hammered dog shit, son.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.111
Al?

02:45.112 --> 02:46.319
Al?

02:47.569 --> 02:49.511
You're not here.

02:51.093 --> 02:53.111
I know this isn't real.

02:54.023 --> 02:55.390
I just want it to stop.

02:56.023 --> 02:58.363
Sometimes we don't get what we want.

03:00.033 --> 03:01.467
Like me with you.

03:02.727 --> 03:06.386
You've been a complete
disappointment to me.

03:07.362 --> 03:09.143
You almost saved him,

03:10.103 --> 03:14.162
but you had to bring
in Bill and now Sadie.

03:14.163 --> 03:17.143
[coughs]

03:26.642 --> 03:28.622
You're only thinking of yourself.

03:32.053 --> 03:34.336
You're not the man I thought you were.

03:34.337 --> 03:35.441
Sadie?

03:36.685 --> 03:38.131
Where's Sadie?

03:38.132 --> 03:40.113
I'm right here. [echoing]

03:44.183 --> 03:45.941
[muffled] Right here, honey.

03:46.653 --> 03:47.982
[clearer] I'm right here.

03:52.913 --> 03:54.877
- Everything's mixed up.
- It's okay.

03:55.457 --> 03:56.591
You're awake.

03:57.369 --> 03:59.403
You've been drifting
in and out for days.

04:00.316 --> 04:02.507
This is an improvement, right, Deke?

04:02.508 --> 04:04.061
Seen it in some of the boys

04:04.062 --> 04:06.700
that get their bell rung
on the football field.

04:07.819 --> 04:09.799
You have some memory problems.

04:18.023 --> 04:20.053
I just want him to get back to normal.

04:21.183 --> 04:24.868
Could be a couple of days.
Could be a couple of weeks.

04:26.023 --> 04:28.229
But, listen, Sadie, the
important thing is

04:28.230 --> 04:30.282
he's not in any medical danger anymore.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.963
Just be grateful for that.

04:34.300 --> 04:36.083
He just needs some time.

John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

05:41.872 --> 05:44.051
Then who's LBJ?

That's the Vice President.

It's a lot of initials.

Well, I see you still got
your sense of humor.

05:59.113 --> 06:00.551
Let's run through it again.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.517
All right.

06:08.427 --> 06:12.012
that was gonna kill the President.

06:12.013 --> 06:14.851
He lived close to me.

06:16.103 --> 06:18.212
- Not in Jodie, in Dallas.
- Mm-hmm.

06:18.213 --> 06:20.193
Do you remember the address?

06:27.580 --> 06:30.688
Was the guy I was working
with... was he named George?

07:09.103 --> 07:10.513
Do you have an appointment?

07:10.514 --> 07:12.480
Did he make an appointment
when he came by my home

07:12.481 --> 07:15.051
to harass my wife while I wasn't there?

07:15.052 --> 07:16.692
More than once.

07:16.693 --> 07:18.112
Did he make an appointment

07:18.113 --> 07:20.182
when he followed me
outside of my workplace

07:20.183 --> 07:22.628
or to bug my house?

I thought that this was the
United States of America.

You ever hear of that one?

07:29.756 --> 07:35.013

available without an appointment.

No, I know better than
that. Did you even look?

[BBs clatter on floor]

08:32.760 --> 08:33.779
What was your name?

08:33.780 --> 08:35.599

I delivered to you a document
of the utmost importance

09:01.172 --> 09:02.331
for Agent Hosty.

09:02.332 --> 09:06.199
My expectation is that you
will deliver it forthwith.

Don't you want to log this officially?

Why isn't he here now?

You two had a terrible argument.

09:30.292 --> 09:31.695
He threatened you.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.906
Maybe he's the one that beat me.

09:34.382 --> 09:36.224
I can't believe that.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.310
When you phoned, you said he was safe.

09:39.311 --> 09:42.331
Maybe he went away back to Kentucky.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.931
All right, young fella,

09:43.932 --> 09:46.330
Doc says you can manage
the pain with these.

09:46.331 --> 09:48.228
They're gonna make you groggy.

09:49.272 --> 09:51.400
He wants to check on you December 3rd.

[overlapping chatter continues]

10:55.262 --> 10:57.371
And do not laugh.

10:57.372 --> 11:00.231
Laughing makes 'em go batshit.

11:00.232 --> 11:02.261
How did Bill end up here?

11:02.262 --> 11:04.339
This is for people who can't pay.

11:05.767 --> 11:07.330
Dr. Moran didn't hear from you,

11:07.331 --> 11:09.321
so Bill was transferred to us.

11:09.322 --> 11:12.261
He's been on a course of
electroshock therapy,

11:12.262 --> 11:15.321
and he's been quite pleasant.

11:15.322 --> 11:19.394
Well, about the mix-up
that got him here,

11:20.212 --> 11:22.171
I'm very sorry about that.

11:22.172 --> 11:24.392
[man screaming in distance]

11:28.312 --> 11:32.495
I was in the hospital myself,
but I'm here now.

Uh-huh.

- [door opens]
- Go ahead, step inside.

Well, here he is.

Hi, Bill.

11:46.538 --> 11:47.914
Hey, buddy.

11:48.672 --> 11:49.613
Jake.

11:52.068 --> 11:53.537
How are you feeling?

11:56.262 --> 11:58.938
I'm having a very fine day today.

12:00.282 --> 12:01.617
How are you?

12:02.500 --> 12:03.965
I'm so sorry.

12:06.182 --> 12:07.394
I'm sorry, Bill.

12:08.666 --> 12:11.060
You're Jake? My friend Jake, right?

12:12.272 --> 12:17.265
I'm... I'm your brother, remember?

12:18.262 --> 12:19.498
And Sadie?

12:21.222 --> 12:22.363
You remember Sadie?

12:23.322 --> 12:24.742
Hi, Bill.

12:26.232 --> 12:27.479
We missed you.

12:31.242 --> 12:32.862
We get Jell-O today.

12:34.282 --> 12:38.211
Sir, may we have a moment in private?

12:38.212 --> 12:39.251
Certainly.

12:39.252 --> 12:41.341
- I'll go get the release papers.
- Thank you.

12:41.342 --> 12:42.567
Release?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.876
We're taking you home.

12:44.877 --> 12:47.281
Back to Kentucky? To Holden?

12:47.282 --> 12:50.192
No, not... not just yet.

12:52.312 --> 12:54.351
Bill, I was... I was beat up,

12:54.352 --> 12:58.734
and I'm having a very hard
time remembering things.

12:59.292 --> 13:00.792
So I need your help.

13:02.292 --> 13:04.475
Do you remember what we
were doing together?

13:05.854 --> 13:06.798
Do you...

13:07.866 --> 13:10.048
do you remember who we were following?

13:11.552 --> 13:13.281
We weren't following anybody.

13:13.282 --> 13:15.391
That was all in my head... My sickness.

13:15.392 --> 13:17.257
No, that was real.

13:19.302 --> 13:20.319
No.

13:21.242 --> 13:24.231
Bill, we were on a mission
to save the President.

13:24.232 --> 13:25.170
No.

13:26.789 --> 13:29.616
No, I... stop.

13:30.202 --> 13:32.221
You're not... you're not real.

13:32.222 --> 13:33.803
You're not here right now.

13:34.844 --> 13:36.156
It's happening again.

13:37.523 --> 13:40.320
They're gonna shock me if
I tell them about this.

13:40.321 --> 13:42.251
I've got to be quiet.

13:42.252 --> 13:44.241
It's quiet time now. Quiet time now.

13:44.242 --> 13:45.361
- I'm real.
- Quiet...

13:45.362 --> 13:48.171
I'm real. We just...

13:48.172 --> 13:49.483
We want to take you home.

13:49.484 --> 13:51.169
That's what you want, right?

13:52.332 --> 13:54.434
People don't come from the future.

13:55.720 --> 13:57.594
That's all in comic books.

43:58.057 --> 43:59.216
Oh, we got to go.

43:59.217 --> 44:01.276
[engine sputters]

44:02.134 --> 44:03.186
Are we out of gas?

44:03.512 --> 44:06.076
No, it's happening.

44:06.077 --> 44:08.046
The past is pushing back.

44:08.047 --> 44:09.742
Couldn't it just be a dead battery?

44:09.743 --> 44:11.618
No, come on, hon. We got to go.

44:11.619 --> 44:17.167
[dramatic music]

44:28.147 --> 44:30.324
Did you sleep at all?

44:35.127 --> 44:36.472
Lee?

44:41.127 --> 44:42.504
Lee, maybe...

44:44.499 --> 44:47.127
Maybe you could have
the morning with us.

44:48.956 --> 44:50.703
We could go to the zoo.

44:52.444 --> 44:54.054
I have a job.

44:57.157 --> 44:59.602
Maybe I'm ready to talk now.

45:00.107 --> 45:01.509
Not about Minsk.

45:02.708 --> 45:06.606
About... about ourselves.

45:07.859 --> 45:11.127
Me, you.

45:15.826 --> 45:17.026
Stay.

45:19.885 --> 45:21.156
Don't leave.

45:21.157 --> 45:23.246
[car horn honks]

45:23.855 --> 45:25.136
I've got to go.

45:25.486 --> 45:27.654
I told Buell to pick me up from here.

45:28.222 --> 45:29.186
Lee.

45:29.187 --> 45:32.167
[paper crinkling]

45:39.137 --> 45:41.197
Kiss the girls for me.

45:49.207 --> 45:51.188
Just find one that's unlocked.

45:52.150 --> 45:54.099
Shit!

45:54.624 --> 45:57.176
I thought people kept things
unlocked in the '60s.

45:57.177 --> 46:01.176
[suspenseful music]

46:01.177 --> 46:03.958
My daddy used to keep his
keys behind the visor.

46:03.959 --> 46:05.693
Jackpot. Sadie, come on.

46:08.259 --> 46:09.520
God damn it.

46:09.521 --> 46:11.117
All right, I'm gonna hotwire it.

46:11.118 --> 46:12.196
Bill taught me how.

46:12.197 --> 46:17.226
[suspenseful music]

46:17.227 --> 46:19.207
[engine turns over]

46:45.848 --> 46:49.065
You know, they got me working
the loading dock today.

46:49.066 --> 46:50.256
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

46:50.257 --> 46:53.106
But Maynard said we could go
watch all the excitement.

46:53.477 --> 46:54.606
What excitement is that?

46:54.607 --> 46:56.575
You been living under a rock or what?

46:57.107 --> 46:59.066
The President's gonna drive right by.

46:59.067 --> 47:01.186
You know that I'm a Marxist, right?

47:01.187 --> 47:03.206
Does that mean you're gonna
work while everybody else

47:03.207 --> 47:05.408
- gets to take a break?
- Most likely.

47:08.640 --> 47:10.620
I can't believe you're
gonna miss the motorcade.

47:21.047 --> 47:26.207
