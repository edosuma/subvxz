WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:07.108
Previously on ER:

00:07.141 --> 00:08.342
Pupils are equal
and reactive.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.311
What year is it, hon?
Oh-seven.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.579
Good. Let's go to Trauma One.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.147
Quick and concise--
how is she?

00:13.181 --> 00:15.149
Hypotensive, anemic
with abdominal pain,

00:15.183 --> 00:16.784
extensive crush
injuries.
Neela...

00:16.817 --> 00:18.286
You've been great.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.620
I think your day
might have been

00:19.653 --> 00:21.055
a whole lot better
if you never met me.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.124
Oh, not so sure
about that.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.226
Hope I see you around.
Yeah.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.427
You can check yourself
in the ICU.

00:26.460 --> 00:28.229
What?

00:28.262 --> 00:29.730
There are lots of good lessons
for a guy like you up there.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.565
Trust me,
I should know.
You're kidding, right?

00:31.599 --> 00:32.800
No, I'm not kidding you.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.069
Luka's not the chief anymore.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.470
Moretti's the man now.

00:36.504 --> 00:39.740
Well, someone should
talk to Anspaugh.

00:46.647 --> 00:51.419
All right, good luck, Mr. Stoll.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.854
(sighs)

00:53.887 --> 00:56.790
Hey, Dr. Anspaugh.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.526
You know, you're
one busy guy.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.660
I've been calling
your office all week

00:59.693 --> 01:01.529
trying to schedule
an appointment.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.531
Oh, I'm sure my assistant can
fit you in as soon as possible.

01:03.564 --> 01:04.697
But do you have
a few minutes right now?

01:04.732 --> 01:06.267
Because I really
need to talk to you.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.136
I need to get to a hospital
council meeting,

01:08.169 --> 01:10.338
and if there is a God, I can
beat this cross-town traffic.

01:10.371 --> 01:11.772
All right, it's
about Dr. Moretti.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.141
He's all wrong for the ER.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.708
He doesn't understand
how it works.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.477
Kevin is a brilliant
and dedicated physician,

01:16.510 --> 01:17.845
board certified in
emergency medicine.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.580
Yeah, the guy is smart,
I'll give him that,

01:19.613 --> 01:22.616
but he's in way over
his head, and...

01:22.650 --> 01:23.651
And what?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.186
I think you should
replace him

01:25.219 --> 01:28.156
with someone who knows
how to do the job-- me.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.723
(chuckles):
Well, I admire your chutzpah.

01:29.757 --> 01:32.793
Well, you can call it what
you want, but I'm serious.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.328
Look, change
is always hard.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.430
I'm sure he's going
to settle in.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.766
Dr. Anspaugh,
I can do this.

01:38.799 --> 01:43.204
Ask me in another
year or two.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.905
(sighs)

01:44.938 --> 01:47.608
WOMAN (on TV):
And next, go from
trash to treasure...

01:47.641 --> 01:49.410
Hi.
Hey.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.878
...when we learn how to make
lamps out of egg cartons.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.347
Won't that be fun?
Brought you
some magazines.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.249
MAN:
Sounds egg-cellent, Tina.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.318
And your favorite,
Gummi worms.
Thank you.

01:57.351 --> 02:00.688
(TV audio continues)

02:00.721 --> 02:04.692
And, um, and Brad Pitt,
he's outside.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.661
He's over Angelina and
the whole adoption thing

02:07.695 --> 02:10.631
and he wants you.
(shuts off TV)

02:10.663 --> 02:11.932
Are you okay?

02:11.965 --> 02:13.734
(sighs)

02:13.767 --> 02:16.904
I think I'm addicted
to Mornings With Phil and Tina.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.873
Oh, well, hang in there,
you'll be home tomorrow.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.609
Correction-- today.
My staples came out

02:21.642 --> 02:23.611
and my creatinine's
down to point nine.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.446
Worm?
No thank you.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.314
Who sent these flowers?

02:26.347 --> 02:27.815
The ER nurses.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.218
I think they went
a little bit over board.
No.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.652
Everyone's just happy
you're doing so well.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.955
Yeah. Any luck with
Joe's passport?

02:34.988 --> 02:37.258
Oh, it's so crazy.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.693
I mean, there's all
these new travel rules,

02:39.727 --> 02:40.861
so even with
an expedited passport,

02:40.894 --> 02:44.532
it takes, like,
four weeks.

02:44.565 --> 02:45.766
What time you
getting out of here?

02:45.799 --> 02:47.568
Oh, they're not sure.

02:47.601 --> 02:48.836
Lucien wants me
to stay home for a week

02:48.869 --> 02:49.970
before I go back to work.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.672
Mm, lucky you.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.341
Yeah, but what am I going
to do sitting at home?

02:53.374 --> 02:55.709
Um, relax, recuperate,

02:55.743 --> 02:57.711
try and kick your
Phil and Tina addiction.

02:57.745 --> 03:00.581
(pager beeping)

03:00.614 --> 03:03.284
Okay. I'm late.
See you later.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.552
Okay, bye.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.692
TINA:
Now pull the light cord
through the base of your egg...

03:11.725 --> 03:14.795
And that means no more boarding
admitted patients

03:14.828 --> 03:15.863
in the ER hallways.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.431
If there aren't enough beds,

03:17.465 --> 03:18.799
they can wait
in the hallways upstairs.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.334
MAN:
Oh, Lord, it's me,

03:20.368 --> 03:21.835
your servant, Bernie.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.571
I'm dying Lord.
I'm dying.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.739
Do the nurses upstairs
know about this?

03:25.773 --> 03:28.276
Sam, your hair is brown.
(moaning)

03:28.309 --> 03:30.010
And from now on,
I want all patients

03:30.043 --> 03:31.545
to have full
physical examinations.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.746
BERNIE:
Take me, Lord!

03:32.780 --> 03:34.282
It's my time.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.416
PRATT:
You're kidding me, right?

03:35.449 --> 03:36.684
No. Clothes off.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.719
No more of these
half-assed exams.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.888
I've made my peace, Lord.
And we need to have
more consistent

03:40.921 --> 03:42.823
treatment protocols
in line
I'm ready to join you.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.758
with evidence-based
guidelines.
Here I come!

03:44.792 --> 03:45.759
Should we go
help that guy?

03:45.793 --> 03:47.761
Mr. Zucker?

03:47.795 --> 03:49.963
Comes in here every week with
a hangover, claims he dying.
(moaning)

03:49.997 --> 03:51.565
Yeah, once he offered
to put me in his will

03:51.599 --> 03:52.633
if I gave him
a sponge bath.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.668
These are standard
order sets

03:54.702 --> 03:57.371
for acute coronary syndrome,
stroke,

03:57.405 --> 04:01.542
sepsis, alcohol withdrawal
and procedural sedation.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.544
I expect you all
to make use of them.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.513
I'm coming home, Lord,
I'm coming home.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.747
Get to work.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.649
So now we're doing
cookbook medicine?

04:08.682 --> 04:10.951
Why don't they just hire
trained monkeys to work the ER?

04:10.984 --> 04:13.887
Hey, Morris, do you have any
known relatives in Bulgaria?

04:13.921 --> 04:15.323
What?

04:15.356 --> 04:16.790
Frank's new hobby
is genealogy.

04:16.824 --> 04:19.593
He discovered
I'm a descendent
of Spanish royalty.

04:19.627 --> 04:22.930
Then I found this "Archibald
Morrisnov" in Plovdiv.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.031
No, I don't think
we're related.

04:24.064 --> 04:26.066
But, uh, check Venezuela.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.336
I may have a cousin
who runs a kidnapping ring.

04:28.336 --> 04:32.840
(moaning)
Crime is just the desperate
cry of the poor, Archie.

04:32.873 --> 04:33.841
Gates, I thought we
got rid of you.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.343
I think I left

04:35.343 --> 04:36.644
my otoscope down here.
Yeah, I was about

04:36.677 --> 04:38.011
to auction it on eBay.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.414
Oh, stop pretending.
You know you miss me, Frank.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.383
Hey, Abby, you
see Neela today?

04:42.416 --> 04:44.051
Yeah, I was just there.
She's going home.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.354
Oh, that's great.
Yeah, so...

04:46.354 --> 04:47.688
this is your last
chance to visit her.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.390
I already visited her
a bunch of times.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.858
When she was
unconscious, yeah.
Today I'm been busy

04:50.891 --> 04:52.593
and I'm starting my
first shift in ICU...

04:52.626 --> 04:54.495
Tony, go see her.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.397
I...
It's a little...

04:56.430 --> 04:57.831
Yeah, weird. I know.

04:57.865 --> 05:00.501
Stuff happened, but you
just gotta get over it.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.603
You know what?
This is Sarah.
I gotta take this.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.405
Hey, Sarah,
what's up?

05:04.438 --> 05:06.807
Here I go, here I go.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.477
MORETTI:
Dr. Lockhart.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.545
(moaning)

05:13.881 --> 05:15.048
So nice of you
to take time

05:15.082 --> 05:17.618
out of your busy
schedule to join us.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.387
Yeah, I was visiting
a friend of mine...

05:19.420 --> 05:20.888
Fascinating.

05:20.921 --> 05:25.025
I'm instituting a new system
and need a volunteer-- you.

05:25.058 --> 05:26.960
Today you'll be working your
shift in the Waiting Area.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.697
Lord, it's me
again, Bernie.
You mean triage?

05:29.730 --> 05:31.765
No, Waiting.
Here I come!

05:31.799 --> 05:34.902
It's a chance to intervene
at the earliest stage.
I'm letting go.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.438
Yeah, do you really think
that this is the best use...

05:37.471 --> 05:39.106
This is it, Lord.
Open your eyes, Abby.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.908
This is the end.
Take a fresh look.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.910
Just say the word!

05:42.943 --> 05:44.712
Excuse me.

05:47.748 --> 05:48.616
Bernie,

05:48.649 --> 05:50.851
this is God.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.720
Hurry it up already.

05:54.000 --> 06:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:02.162 --> 06:04.432
(indistinct conversations)

06:04.465 --> 06:05.899
(woman coughing)

06:08.636 --> 06:11.439
Yeah, uh, your toe
is infected, ma'am.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.006
And we're gonna have
to remove the nail.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.475
Is there anything
you're allergic to?

06:14.508 --> 06:15.476
I don't like cheese.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.577
Okay.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.145
Uh, someone will
be here shortly

06:18.178 --> 06:20.013
to take you back and then
we'll see about some shoes.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.048
Oh, I like Jimmy Choos.
Right.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.650
Hey, how much longer

06:22.683 --> 06:24.051
do I have to wait
around this place?

06:24.084 --> 06:25.619
Sir, you have
to sit down.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.555
Don't you know
who I am?
Sit down.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.089
(people coughing, groaning)

06:31.725 --> 06:33.927
Carlos Vega.
WOMAN:
Yes.

06:33.961 --> 06:36.464
Hi, I'm Dr. Lockhart.

06:36.497 --> 06:37.965
What seems to be
the problem?

06:37.998 --> 06:39.733
Well, he threw up all night,

06:39.767 --> 06:40.834
and we thought it might have
been something he ate,

06:40.868 --> 06:44.104
but he's getting worse.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.773
Maybe... you can
give me something...

06:45.806 --> 06:46.774
for my stomach...

06:46.807 --> 06:47.841
and then we can go.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.510
Yeah, I think you have a fever.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.078
It's probably
not food poisoning.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.212
Oh, no.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.647
He played
with our baby

06:53.681 --> 06:56.984
all day yesterday.
Honey, Tyler's fine.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.621
Doctor, I gotta
get to work.

07:00.654 --> 07:04.658
How long do we have to wait?

07:04.692 --> 07:06.960
Um...

07:11.231 --> 07:13.667
You know, why don't we just
take you back right now?

07:13.701 --> 07:15.736
Okay?
Oh, thank you.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.671
You all right?

07:22.843 --> 07:26.213
All right, let's do this.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.519
You know, I was
thinking about

07:31.552 --> 07:33.687
going down to Baton
Rouge and visit Ray.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.623
Yeah, we'll go together.

07:35.656 --> 07:38.058
Three of us could, uh,
catch a Saints game.

07:38.091 --> 07:39.927
Sounds good.
We should do that.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.195
(chuckles)

07:42.229 --> 07:43.564
Seaweed scalp mist.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.065
(laughing)

07:45.098 --> 07:47.034
Ray was a little hair
obsessed, but I gotta say,

07:47.067 --> 07:48.235
the man's lid always
looked good.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.138
(laughs)

07:52.740 --> 07:54.742
Oh, boy.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.279
Are these a,
these a size nine?

07:59.312 --> 08:00.681
Don't even
go there, Morris.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.281
What's he gonna
do with them?

08:01.314 --> 08:02.750
I mean...

08:02.783 --> 08:06.119
Sir, back away from
the shoes, all right?

08:06.153 --> 08:09.189
GRADY:
Guys, is that
locker available?

08:09.222 --> 08:10.558
What?

08:10.591 --> 08:11.892
I haven't been assigned one yet.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.260
Stop.

08:13.293 --> 08:15.563
No one's using this locker.
It's retired.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.031
(chuckles):
You can't retire an ER locker.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.770
Can you?

08:22.803 --> 08:24.304
You can use one of
those lockers over there.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.040
Yeah, this one's off limits.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.748
Hey, so what can we bring to
dinner tonight at Chez Pratt?

08:34.782 --> 08:35.849
Ah, it's really
not necessary,

08:35.883 --> 08:36.884
but maybe some red wine.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.051
Vino, it is.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.852
Hey, thanks again
for the invite.

08:39.886 --> 08:41.321
Well, it was Betina's idea
to do this double date thing.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.655
She really
likes you, man.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.592
Hey, Pratt.
Mazel Tov.

08:44.592 --> 08:45.993
You having a stroke, Frank?

08:46.026 --> 08:48.228
Did you know that your
great-great-great-grandmother

08:48.261 --> 08:50.931
on your mother's side
was an Ethiopian Jew?

08:50.964 --> 08:52.600
Wow, Black
and Jewish.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.267
You're like County's
own Sammy Davis Jr.

08:54.301 --> 08:55.669
Get out of here.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.104
* Who can take
a rainbow *

08:57.137 --> 08:58.138
* Wrap it in
the sky? *
Archie...

08:58.171 --> 08:59.807
* The Pratt-man can.

08:59.840 --> 09:01.975
Come on, Sam, you said you
wanted to get out there again.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.010
Oh, I don't know.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.311
You and your fabulous new hair

09:04.344 --> 09:05.746
needs to come out
with us tonight.

09:05.779 --> 09:06.847
Where you
gals going?

09:06.880 --> 09:07.915
Speed dating
at Ike's.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.316
What the heck is speed dating?

09:09.349 --> 09:11.885
It's a way for losers
to meet other losers-- fast.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.621
No, you get
six minutes,

09:13.654 --> 09:14.755
you sit at a table and you
talk to a bunch of guys.

09:14.788 --> 09:15.989
And how the heck are you

09:16.023 --> 09:17.658
supposed to get know
somebody like that?

09:17.691 --> 09:19.760
Chemistry.
Seems more like desperation.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.161
So, Sam, are you
in or not?

09:21.194 --> 09:22.663
Oh, it sounds like fun,
but I'm...

09:22.696 --> 09:23.897
Maybe she
doesn't want to

09:23.931 --> 09:25.866
because she has her
eye on someone else.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.834
What? Who?

09:26.867 --> 09:28.168
Officer Litchman.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.670
Oh, he is cute.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.104
I thought I noticed
a spark between you two.

09:31.138 --> 09:34.808
Yeah? I mean, no.
I mean, yes, I think he's cute.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.209
But I would never date a cop.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.945
PRATT:
Frank, you got
it wrong, man.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.313
My grandfather was
Steven with a "V."

09:40.347 --> 09:42.149
MVC, second victim
behind me.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.852
16-year-old unrestrained
driver ejected from vehicle.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.153
What's your name?
Joanna... where's Joanna.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.655
Casey Barnes.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.989
Blunt head trauma,
awake but altered.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.390
Hang on, Casey.
CBC, chem panel,

09:50.423 --> 09:51.859
type and cross
four units.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.093
25-year-old,
restrained passenger.

09:53.126 --> 09:54.762
No LOC, vitals stable.

09:54.795 --> 09:55.996
How's Casey?
Is he all right?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.164
Let's worry
about you first.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.232
All right, CBC,
type and screen, UA.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.868
Airway's patent,
spontaneous resps.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.102
Damn it, IV blew.

10:02.135 --> 10:02.970
Regular rhythm,
carotid pulses thready.

10:03.003 --> 10:03.971
Casey, look at me.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.205
Do you know
where you are?

10:05.238 --> 10:06.073
(slurring speech)
Whoa, whoa, easy.

10:06.106 --> 10:06.940
Sam, he's tachy--

10:06.974 --> 10:08.108
get that bolus up.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.743
I'm trying, but I can't
get a flash,

10:09.777 --> 10:11.244
his pressure's
too low.
We need
access, Sam.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.213
I'll go central.
Cordis and sterile 7s please.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.381
Hope, when a trauma
rolls in

10:14.414 --> 10:15.816
you're supposed
to jump on.

10:15.849 --> 10:16.884
Sorry, thought you
could handle it.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.185
I'm handling it fine.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.887
Need to help Joa...

10:19.920 --> 10:21.421
Agitation could
be sign of ICH.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.023
I'll call for a head CT.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.425
Pupils equal
but sluggish.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.260
Sorry about earlier.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.862
I just can't stop thinking
about the mosquito thing.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.297
Oh, right, mosquitoes
love redheads.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.799
We'll talk about it
later tonight, okay?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.066
Can somebody hand me
the introducer?

10:33.100 --> 10:34.001
I'm sterile.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.368
Not sterile enough.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.671
No drape, no gown, no mask.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.406
Do you know, in the ICU
we prophylactically remove

10:39.439 --> 10:41.975
all ER lines 'cause your rate
of infection is so high?

10:42.009 --> 10:43.744
It's my fault.
Kid was crashing,

10:43.777 --> 10:45.145
and I asked her
to jump in.
That's not true,

10:45.178 --> 10:48.115
I just...
Spare me.
Just do it right.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.917
(Casey slurring speech)

10:49.950 --> 10:51.752
All right, pupils
equal and reactive.

10:51.785 --> 10:52.986
Guarding a little.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.755
How's she doing?

10:54.788 --> 10:56.890
Airway's good,
GCS 15.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.425
I am Dr. Moretti.
How you feeling?

10:58.458 --> 10:59.760
I've been better.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.161
She's tachy, you
got a pressure?

11:01.194 --> 11:02.730
126 over 76.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.164
Please, is Casey okay?

11:04.197 --> 11:05.899
Doctors are
working on him.
Oh, God.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.267
All right,
her pelvis is stable,

11:07.300 --> 11:08.836
we got superficial abrasions
to the right thigh.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.470
This whole thing
is my fault.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.006
I should've never
let him drive.
Is he your brother?

11:13.040 --> 11:15.408
No, my student.
I teach math at Edgewater.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.778
I was, uh... tutoring him
before school.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.146
In the car?

11:19.179 --> 11:22.015
He just got his license,
begged me to go driving.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.784
Chest film's back.
Okay.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.253
My son was in the National Math
Olympiad in high school.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.487
Now he's squandering
his talents

11:27.520 --> 11:29.156
as a comp lit
major at Brown.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.892
Go figure.
What do you see?

11:31.925 --> 11:33.026
Is that a little
pneumo?
Yep.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.194
Let's put her
on high flow

11:34.227 --> 11:35.796
oh-two and set up
for a chest tube.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.798
GRADY:
Sweet.
Whoa, whoa. Overkill.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.399
She's got a 20%
pneumothorax
on the left.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.002
What does that mean?
Is that bad?

11:42.035 --> 11:43.136
It means part of your
lung has collapsed

11:43.170 --> 11:45.906
and we need to
reinflate it.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.207
Okay, Dr. Dr. Pratt.
Your patient.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.242
All right. Lido
and ten-blade to me.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.512
Okay, why don't you
take off your shirt?

11:52.545 --> 11:53.847
No, that's okay.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.315
I need to examine
your abdomen.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.350
Do you really need to make
a big deal about this?

11:57.384 --> 11:58.852
My boss is a real pain.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.053
He won't like that I'm late.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.488
Well, it won't
take long.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.056
And my boss is a real pain,
and he won't like it

12:03.090 --> 12:05.993
if I don't do a thorough exam.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.363
What's that?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.465
Oh, he got hurt at work.

12:12.499 --> 12:13.801
It's nothing.
I was stupid.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.068
Elena helped me
clean it out.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.805
Hold still.
I need to check it out.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.072
No, you don't...

12:19.106 --> 12:22.009
(crying out in pain)

12:24.845 --> 12:26.279
How did this
happen again?

12:26.313 --> 12:29.917
Funny. This doesn't look
like the waiting area.

12:29.950 --> 12:34.888
So, sir, how did you
manage to get yourself shot?

12:34.922 --> 12:37.991
It was a drive-by,
and I got hit.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.459
When did this happen?

12:39.492 --> 12:40.828
Three
nights ago.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.395
Why didn't he go
to the hospital?

12:42.429 --> 12:44.264
Well, he doesn't like doctors.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.298
That's all right.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.835
I don't take that personally.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.203
It's not what it looks like.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.906
Right. I'll be right back.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.574
Start with a plain film,
find out where the bullet is?

12:54.607 --> 12:57.110
Yeah, and
notify the police.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.278
Morning, Neela.

12:58.311 --> 13:00.247
Morning. What
happened to you?

13:00.280 --> 13:03.183
Field hockey.
Your LFTs look good.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.318
You should be able to go
home in an hour or two.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.154
That's what they said
four hours ago.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.989
CRENSHAW:
Any trouble voiding?

13:09.022 --> 13:10.858
No. My Foley is out.

13:10.858 --> 13:11.859
Are you still
passing gas?

13:11.859 --> 13:13.160
Would you stop, Dusty?

13:13.193 --> 13:14.427
I think she's been
through enough already.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.196
No going home until
Neela makes poo-poo.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.866
You know, my post-op
ileus has resolved.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.268
(pager beeps)
That's the ER. Let's go, Dusty.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.371
It's good to see you
up and around.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.181
Okay. 13-year-old.

13:34.214 --> 13:37.384
Pneumonia, dysphagia,
normal CT.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.486
Chang, what crucial
historical detail

13:39.519 --> 13:41.388
did Dr. Udesky omit?

13:41.421 --> 13:42.990
Weight loss?
Night sweats?

13:43.023 --> 13:44.591
No, no, I'm talking
about the one thing

13:44.624 --> 13:47.060
we must know to narrow down
this vast differential here.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.295
MRI results?

13:48.328 --> 13:49.963
Come on, guys,
you're breaking my heart.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.032
Excuse me.
Duration of symptoms.

13:52.065 --> 13:55.602
Sudden onset-- we're thinking
stroke, infection, trauma.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.105
Slow onset-- we're thinking
tumor, metabolic... yes?
Excuse me.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.607
Dr. Shuster, I'm Dr. Gates,
Moretti sent me up here.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.309
Yet you still you show up
20 minutes late.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.311
I was doing a follow-up
on a patient.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.379
This is the critical care unit,
people are dying.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.248
I don't have time
to potty train ER rejects.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.649
Get me an MRI,
call neuro.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.385
I want a diagnosis before lunch.

14:16.924 --> 14:19.326
Looks like the boss lady
ripped you a new one.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.295
Oh, you're too young to know
what flirting looks like.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.264
See what's taking so long in CT.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.266
You don't even speak Spanish.
I'll learn.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.600
Sat's down to 82.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.302
Okay, get him
on a non-rebreather

14:29.336 --> 14:31.671
and Hope, get ready to tube him.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.573
This is the kid's mom.
(Casey moans)

14:33.606 --> 14:35.108
Baby, it's mom.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.143
Honey, I'm right here.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.377
Right here.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.678
Your son's been
in a car crash.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.481
He's lost a lot of
blood. Run a ten.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.283
Casey, come on,
throw me the bag.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.618
Ma'am, I'm Dr. Morris.
We're gonna put a tube

14:45.652 --> 14:47.287
in to breathe
for him.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.688
I don't understand.
What happened?

14:48.721 --> 14:50.223
He was driving,
he hit a guardrail.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.524
He was ejected about 20 feet.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.193
Driving?
Casey doesn't have a car.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.628
He came in with her.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.030
Do you know that woman?

14:57.064 --> 14:58.531
Yeah.
Darn, bulb's out.

14:58.565 --> 15:00.067
I need a new scope, Mac 2.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.335
Casey, honey,
wake up, wake up.

15:02.369 --> 15:05.472
Talk to me.
I'll get it.

15:05.505 --> 15:06.539
HOPE:
He's in V tach, lost the pulse.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.540
Charge the paddles,

15:07.574 --> 15:11.378
starting compressions.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.116
Is Casey okay?

15:16.149 --> 15:17.684
He's pretty sick.

15:17.717 --> 15:18.986
MORETTI:
How are we doing?

15:18.986 --> 15:20.220
She's got
a hemothorax.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.721
Good thing we put in
a chest tube.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.256
It was the right call.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.324
Systolic's only 85.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.725
All right, Dawn,
let CT know

15:25.758 --> 15:27.660
that we're coming for
a chest and abdomen.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.229
I wouldn't do that.
Why not?

15:29.262 --> 15:30.530
She's pregnant.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.099
What?

15:32.132 --> 15:35.035
Right there,
that's a fetal heartbeat.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.303
Didn't you order an ICON?

15:36.336 --> 15:38.105
Yeah, he did.
The lab's backed up.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.441
I'm pregnant?

15:41.474 --> 15:44.277
Looks like you weren't
the only one in the dark.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.484
Small caliber bullet
in the T-12 vertebral body.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.086
He's febrile,
probably infected.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.188
He needs the OR
for debridement.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.424
Abby, the detectives
are here.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.092
You called the police?

15:59.126 --> 16:00.360
We're obligated
to report gun shot wounds.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.029
Get a CT, make sure
there's nothing

16:02.062 --> 16:05.198
in the spinal canal
or abdomen.
Right.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.699
Mr. Vega,

16:06.733 --> 16:08.535
we heard you were a
victim of a drive-by.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.603
Yeah.
Can you tell us
when and where?

16:10.637 --> 16:13.040
Three nights ago on my block,
I was walking home.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.308
That would be 3027 Pierce?

16:15.342 --> 16:17.577
Right.
We don't have a
report of that.

16:17.610 --> 16:18.778
There was a shooting
at a deli

16:18.811 --> 16:20.347
on Leavitt
three nights ago.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.215
Owner was shot, but not
before he returned fire.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.516
Carlos had nothing
to do with that.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.386
Elena, why don't you
call your mom.

16:26.419 --> 16:29.056
Have her take Tyler home.

16:29.056 --> 16:32.325
It's all right.
Three Latino
suspects got away,

16:32.359 --> 16:33.726
but witnesses say one
of them was wounded.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.162
It wasn't me.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.264
Ask the store owner.
He's in a coma.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.465
As long as your bullet
isn't a match

16:38.498 --> 16:41.068
for his gun,
you don't have a problem.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.537
Gross hematuria.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.539
All right, we're taking her
to the scanner right now.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.141
Is that okay? She's in
the first trimester.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.077
No, too much
radiation.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.411
Please don't hurt my baby.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.180
Joanna, we need
to focus on you now, okay?

16:53.213 --> 16:54.714
Please, someone go see
how Casey's doing.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.549
I need to know.
I'll check.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.252
What, what?
You can't do a CT,
she'll never consent.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.620
She's in shock.
She's not competent.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.155
Let's follow with
a formal ultrasound.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.356
We'll get a good
look at the kidneys

17:03.390 --> 17:04.723
with a fraction
of the radiation.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.559
We cannot do the formal
ultrasound that fast.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.161
Why, you're a
resourceful guy.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.329
You expect a radiologist

17:09.362 --> 17:11.098
to be at my beck
and call Q-15 minutes?

17:11.131 --> 17:12.531
Yeah, I do.

17:12.565 --> 17:14.501
They don't have enough
machines or techs available...

17:14.534 --> 17:16.836
DAWN:
Hey, guys, they
need help in here.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.538
What's wrong with Casey?

17:18.570 --> 17:21.741
Make it happen,
Dr. Pratt.

17:21.773 --> 17:25.145
Charged to 360. Clear!

17:26.313 --> 17:27.714
Still no pulse, v fib.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.649
Resume CPR.
SAM:
Epi's in.

17:29.682 --> 17:30.850
How many rounds of meds
has he got?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.186
It's the fifth. Yes.
Amiodarone?

17:33.220 --> 17:34.521
No.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.123
You're coding a patient in here

17:36.123 --> 17:38.358
and nobody bothered
to come and get me?

17:38.391 --> 17:40.693
I'm on top of it.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.262
Really?

17:42.295 --> 17:44.397
You're blasting
the myocardium with drugs

17:44.431 --> 17:46.566
and you're hoping
for a miracle.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.768
Please, you've got to save him.

17:48.801 --> 17:50.803
Sam, give the amio.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.206
Did you hear what I just said?

17:58.578 --> 18:02.582
He's a kid.
I am aware of that.

18:06.419 --> 18:10.157
Mom, come here.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.775
We've been trying
to restart his heart

18:28.808 --> 18:31.478
for over a half hour now.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.580
You have to keep going.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.183
His injuries
are too severe.

18:36.183 --> 18:39.652
He's lost too much blood.

18:39.686 --> 18:40.553
No.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.822
No, this isn't happening.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.657
I'm going to stop CPR now,
which means...

18:44.691 --> 18:47.260
No!

18:47.294 --> 18:49.629
Oh, no, no, no!

18:49.662 --> 18:51.798
Please don't stop.

18:58.271 --> 19:01.241
He's just a boy.

19:01.274 --> 19:04.211
He's my baby.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.214
(sobbing)

19:08.515 --> 19:10.517
(crying)

19:10.550 --> 19:11.618
Casey...

19:11.651 --> 19:14.554
(sobbing continues)

19:16.756 --> 19:18.825
So where's your mom?

19:18.858 --> 19:20.260
She's at work.

19:20.293 --> 19:23.896
She'll be here later.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.765
Dr. Schuster
was obnoxious,

19:25.798 --> 19:27.534
no question, but...

19:27.567 --> 19:30.303
you could've been
a little more contrite.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.338
You know,
played the game.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.639
Oh, believe me,
I'm trying.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.242
How about an eight?
Does an eight work here?

19:35.242 --> 19:38.678
No, and I'm not
talking about Sudoku.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.413
The game, life.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.549
Playing well
with others.

19:42.582 --> 19:45.352
You seem to have
a problem with that.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.721
How about a six?
Would a six work here?

19:48.755 --> 19:50.790
Your evasiveness tells
me I'm on to something.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.660
(chuckles)

19:55.728 --> 19:59.599
Did your dad hit you
when you were a kid?
What?

19:59.632 --> 20:00.467
Parental abuse.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.868
It's a common root

20:01.901 --> 20:04.537
of authority and ego
problems in adulthood.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.307
Thank you, Dr. Freud.

20:07.340 --> 20:10.710
I'm more of
a Jungian.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.346
You have no idea what
I'm talking about.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.415
I never watched Star Trek.

20:15.448 --> 20:18.851
And, um, you're starting
to freaking me out, kid.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.920
Yeah, I have that
affect on people.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.424
I'm in college now
at U of C

20:24.457 --> 20:26.759
and I raise my hand
to ask a question,

20:26.793 --> 20:28.461
the whole class stares.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.363
That must be weird, huh?

20:30.397 --> 20:32.965
Yeah, I kind of stick
out at frat parties.

20:32.999 --> 20:37.304
Yeah, well...
I'm, uh, having trouble

20:37.337 --> 20:40.407
these days trying to
figure out where I fit in.

20:40.440 --> 20:45.912
And, uh... you were right
about me and my dad.

20:50.483 --> 20:54.687
If you want to impress those
stuck up ICU types, three words.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.324
Fazio-Londe disease.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.025
It's very rare.

20:59.058 --> 21:02.329
Who knows how long it'll
take them to figure it out.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.364
Is that what you think you have?

21:04.397 --> 21:06.499
Not think.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.500
Know.

21:07.534 --> 21:08.668
Well, when you were admitted,

21:08.701 --> 21:10.703
why didn't
your mother tell them?

21:11.704 --> 21:13.706
She doesn't know.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.943
I haven't told her.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.911
No, that's not good enough,
I need an ultrasound now,

21:18.945 --> 21:20.513
not in 45 minutes.

21:20.547 --> 21:22.382
Pratt, your alter
cocker in Three

21:22.415 --> 21:24.417
is kvetching about his kishka.
What?

21:24.451 --> 21:26.018
It's the language
of your people.

21:26.052 --> 21:27.954
Hey, Abby, you want to get
in on a detached retina?

21:27.987 --> 21:29.689
I have to go back to Waiting.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.359
Mussolini was not happy
to see me out of my cage.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.827
Doctor, can I talk to you?
Sure.

21:34.861 --> 21:38.765
Um, Carlos doesn't want
to have the operation.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.700
Why not?

21:40.733 --> 21:43.903
Well, um, he was at
the deli that night.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.772
Oh, I don't need
to hear this.
Please, doctor.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.407
I don't want
to hear it.
He was just there
to buy milk.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.576
Please, please,
you have to listen.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.978
Please.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.982
Okay.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.085
That night in the deli,

21:59.118 --> 22:01.621
two guys came in and they
started making trouble

22:01.654 --> 22:02.722
and they pulled out guns.

22:02.755 --> 22:03.990
Carlos told you this.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.658
He tried
to stop them, okay,

22:05.692 --> 22:06.959
but they just
started shooting

22:06.993 --> 22:09.095
and he ran so fast
he didn't even realize

22:09.128 --> 22:10.530
he was hurt
until he got home.

22:10.563 --> 22:11.831
Yeah, but why didn't
you call the police

22:11.864 --> 22:13.600
when you saw
he was shot?

22:13.633 --> 22:14.834
Well, Carlos wanted to,

22:14.867 --> 22:17.870
but I didn't let him.
Why?

22:17.904 --> 22:21.140
The guys who did this, they
are from our neighborhood, okay?

22:21.173 --> 22:24.877
They know who we are,
they know where we live.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.946
Well, that bullet
is lodged in his spine

22:26.979 --> 22:30.049
and surgery really
is the only...
He won't do it.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.885
Small fluid in Morrison's,

22:32.919 --> 22:35.588
but no hematoma,
renal anatomy's intact.

22:35.622 --> 22:37.424
What do you make of the fact
that she's still peeing blood?

22:37.424 --> 22:39.058
Probably just
parenchymal contusions.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.727
If the urine doesn't
clear in an hour,

22:40.760 --> 22:43.062
we'll do an IVP like
Dr. Moretti suggested.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.597
She's good.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.098
Be back in 15 minutes
to repeat the scan.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.034
Dr. Pratt, I knew
you'd find a way.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.869
He was 16! A child!

22:49.902 --> 22:51.070
Hey, hey, hey!
Don't do this.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.572
I have your e-mails,
the photos.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.673
You're going to jail!

22:53.706 --> 22:54.607
Ma'am, I know this is hard,

22:54.641 --> 22:55.475
but you just can't...

22:55.508 --> 22:56.776
She molested my son!

22:56.809 --> 22:58.110
You've got to leave.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.447
This is your fault.
He's dead because of you.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.147
What?!

23:01.180 --> 23:02.014
You saw the blood.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.550
He was rushing me here.

23:03.583 --> 23:06.553
That's why we crashed.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.

23:06.586 --> 23:07.687
You're gonna have
to stop hating me.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.589
I am having his baby.

23:09.622 --> 23:10.457
Okay.
Come on.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.191
What?

23:12.224 --> 23:14.527
You have to leave.
I'm sorry.

23:14.561 --> 23:17.096
If they take out the bullet, the
cops will place me at the scene.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.598
Well, just tell them
what really happened.

23:18.631 --> 23:19.666
They won't believe me--
all they see

23:19.699 --> 23:20.800
is another spic from the hood.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.602
Hopefully, the store owner

23:22.635 --> 23:24.771
will come out of his coma and
he can back up your story.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.005
And if he doesn't,

23:26.038 --> 23:27.840
then Carlos
will go to jail.

23:27.874 --> 23:31.043
I got a good job
and Elena, the baby.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.645
I don't want to lose them.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.180
Okay, look,
just get a lawyer...

23:34.213 --> 23:37.049
The legal system doesn't work
for guys like me.

23:37.083 --> 23:41.020
Do you understand that
you could be paralyzed?

23:43.490 --> 23:45.157
I'll take my chances.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.127
I talked to Carlos
for over an hour

23:48.160 --> 23:49.796
and now they want to speak
to the surgeon in charge.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.498
And he still won't consent
to the debridement?

23:51.498 --> 23:52.865
He's convinced he's screwed
if they find the bullet.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.501
He understands the risks?

23:54.534 --> 23:56.769
Well, then it's his right
to refuse. Detectives.

23:56.803 --> 23:58.738
The DA just got off
the phone with a judge

23:58.771 --> 24:00.640
who's issuing an
emergency court order

24:00.673 --> 24:03.009
compelling Carlos
Vega to have surgery.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.877
What?
It'll be here
within the hour.

24:04.911 --> 24:05.945
The state can't dictate
treatment of a patient.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.647
Well, it just did.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.782
The bullet will tell us
if he's guilty or not.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.551
Well, it doesn't matter
if he's guilty or not.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.886
This patient has rights,
and we're not going to do it.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.588
Well, it's not
up to you.
Really?

24:15.622 --> 24:16.923
Well, what's next?
Forced sterilizations?

24:16.956 --> 24:18.525
Mandated amputations?
I mean, this is...

24:18.525 --> 24:19.959
Abby, Abby, Abby.
Maybe it's for the best.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.528
Carlos needs the surgery,

24:21.561 --> 24:23.630
and these guys are only
trying to do their job.

24:23.663 --> 24:26.733
We'll get an OR ready.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.735
Thanks, doc.

24:28.768 --> 24:29.802
You're kidding me, right?
I don't like it,
but it's done.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.203
Yeah, he has the
right to refuse.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.672
You just said so
two minutes ago!
You know what?

24:32.705 --> 24:33.840
If we leave the bullet in,

24:33.873 --> 24:35.074
he ends up
in a wheelchair anyway.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.776
Not definitely,
and not immediately.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.611
We can start him
on IV antibiotics

24:38.645 --> 24:39.946
and then talk to
Legal, alert the media.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.247
High-minded, Abby,
very high-minded, but naive.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.615
If we refuse
to perform the surgery,

24:42.649 --> 24:43.249
they'll get some other
hospital to do.

24:43.282 --> 24:44.717
You don't know that.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.252
Yes, yes, as a
matter of fact I do.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.154
And since a tricky spinal
procedure is inevitable,

24:48.187 --> 24:49.622
I'd rather I do it
than someone else
who's not as good.

24:49.656 --> 24:50.690
Oh, really? How did this
become about you?

24:50.723 --> 24:52.091
Let it go,
Abby, let it go.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.560
I can't believe you're not
even going to try to...

24:53.593 --> 24:55.094
You know what, as
Head of Surgery,

24:55.127 --> 24:56.796
I'm telling you, this case
is no longer your concern.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.632
Type and cross four
units and send him up.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.570
It's called
Fazio-Londe syndrome.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.937
That's incredibly rare.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.840
Yeah, only 30-something
cases in the literature.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.676
It's a progressive
motor disorder.

25:09.709 --> 25:12.011
The aspiration pneumonia
is from decreased function

25:12.044 --> 25:13.312
of the ninth and
tenth cranial nerves.

25:13.345 --> 25:16.683
I did an EMG,
MRI. It all fits.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.785
You need to confirm this
with a muscle biopsy.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.753
Well, Neuro's on
it this afternoon.

25:20.787 --> 25:22.922
Way to be proactive,
Dr. Gates.

25:22.955 --> 25:23.956
We round again at 3:00.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.593
All right.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.028
So it worked.

25:29.061 --> 25:32.632
Yeah, it worked.

25:32.665 --> 25:36.268
What I want to know is--
how did you figure this out?

25:38.237 --> 25:40.907
At first, it felt like
a lump in my throat.

25:40.940 --> 25:44.243
Then it got to where solid
food made me throw up.

25:44.276 --> 25:47.146
You didn't go to a doctor?

25:47.179 --> 25:49.616
I convinced a grad
student in Neurophysiology

25:49.649 --> 25:51.017
to do a muscle biopsy

25:51.050 --> 25:55.054
on the D.L.

25:55.087 --> 25:56.923
Confirmed what I already knew.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.958
But your mom... You-You didn't
tell your mother?

25:58.991 --> 26:00.192
Well, what's the
use in telling her

26:00.226 --> 26:03.162
before she absolutely
has to know?

26:03.195 --> 26:05.932
Because she's your mother.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.166
She-She-She wants
to help you.

26:07.199 --> 26:10.770
She wants to take
care of you.

26:10.803 --> 26:13.673
This news is pretty much
going to ruin her life.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.041
She'll spend
everything she has

26:15.074 --> 26:17.710
trying to keep me alive,
which is silly,

26:17.744 --> 26:23.650
'cause this disease
is invariably fatal.

26:23.650 --> 26:26.719
Well, there must be some sort of
experimental treatments, right?

26:26.753 --> 26:30.222
Trials?

26:31.658 --> 26:33.726
(quietly):
No.

26:35.194 --> 26:38.665
Well, know, you-you...
you have to tell her.

26:38.665 --> 26:41.333
You have to tell her.

26:42.368 --> 26:45.237
You know that, right?

26:47.206 --> 26:50.242
Would you like me to be there?

26:52.945 --> 26:55.381
It's okay.

26:55.414 --> 26:59.218
I'll tell her tonight.

27:00.720 --> 27:01.988
(overlapping crowd chatter)

27:02.021 --> 27:03.389
Okay, what happened here?

27:03.422 --> 27:05.024
Killer bit me.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.325
What kind of
dog is Killer?

27:06.358 --> 27:08.795
He's not a dog.
He's a gerbil.

27:08.828 --> 27:11.263
Wow, that's a good name for him.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.867
Uh, let's just clean him up
and give him some antibiotics.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.836
And, ma'am, what
brings you here today?

27:16.869 --> 27:19.872
I'm here for the air.

27:19.906 --> 27:21.874
County air is very therapeutic.

27:21.908 --> 27:24.777
Okay, so, um, you didn't want
to see a doctor or anything?

27:24.811 --> 27:25.912
You're just here to...

27:25.945 --> 27:28.280
Breathe.
Right.

27:28.314 --> 27:30.016
Knock yourself out.

27:30.049 --> 27:32.819
Uh, Chuny, the guy
in the sunglasses has been

27:32.852 --> 27:35.722
in the same position
for, like, all day.

27:35.755 --> 27:39.959
Another drunk
sleeping it off.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.428
Hey, sir?

27:42.461 --> 27:44.764
Sir?

27:44.797 --> 27:45.865
Sir?!

27:45.898 --> 27:47.800
Oh, please don't be dead. Sir?

27:47.834 --> 27:49.836
Hey! Oh!

27:49.869 --> 27:53.172
I need a gurney
over here, now!

27:53.205 --> 27:55.241
So the drunk with
the sunglasses isn't drunk.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.342
He's bleeding into his head.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.443
Yeah, we know that, thank you.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.111
Systolic's 182.

27:59.145 --> 28:00.780
All right, bolus
50 of mannitol,

28:00.813 --> 28:03.115
20 per kilo, Dilantin. Tube.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.417
It's a classic example
of availability bias.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.219
I have no idea what that means,

28:07.253 --> 28:08.988
but I'm sure
you're about to tell us.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.256
Yeah. The waiting area is full

28:10.289 --> 28:11.791
of drunk, sleeping,
homeless people,

28:11.824 --> 28:13.492
so that's what Chuny saw
when she looked at him.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.128
I feel bad
enough, all right?

28:16.162 --> 28:17.496
All right, I'm in.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.932
Toss me the bag,
call Respiratory for a vent.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.834
MORETTI:
Nice pick-up, anyway.
Stabilize him

28:21.868 --> 28:23.770
and get back
into the waiting room.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.437
Clearly, we need you out there.

28:25.471 --> 28:26.939
Call CT, let 'em know
we're on our way

28:26.973 --> 28:29.475
and get Neurosurge down here.

28:29.508 --> 28:31.477
There-There's no
ozone in the tropics.

28:31.510 --> 28:32.845
Our-Our skin
will melt off.

28:32.879 --> 28:34.046
Okay, enough.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.081
You don't want to go.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.182
I'll go without you.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.784
Wait. Without me?

28:37.784 --> 28:39.351
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, Archie.

28:39.385 --> 28:41.053
But I'll worry,
and-and I'll miss you,

28:41.087 --> 28:42.121
and I want us
to be together.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.156
It's only for
six months.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.892
Hope, w...

28:45.925 --> 28:48.160
Morris!

28:48.194 --> 28:49.461
Did you know your gal Hope there

28:49.495 --> 28:51.030
descends from a tribe
of gypsy whores?

28:51.063 --> 28:52.498
Wow, Frank.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.200
You obviously don't have enough
work to do around here.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.434
Has anyone seen Sam?

28:55.467 --> 28:56.969
Yeah. She's still in
with the MVC mom.

28:57.003 --> 28:58.170
We're going to Ike's early

28:58.204 --> 28:59.839
to premedicate
before speed dating.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.507
Wow. That sounds good.
I could use a drink.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.442
Hey, I'll bring some extra
Manischewitz tonight.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.812
Yeah, we know how your tribe
loves the fruit of the vine.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.947
All right, will you
knock it off already?

29:07.980 --> 29:12.384
You guys can be a real
pain in the tuchis?

29:19.358 --> 29:21.027
Hey. Any news yet?

29:21.060 --> 29:22.128
No.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.896
It's been over
two hours.

29:23.930 --> 29:26.132
Well, Carlos is going
to be all right.

29:26.165 --> 29:27.834
They shouldn't have forced him
to have an operation.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.268
I mean, it isn't right.

29:29.301 --> 29:31.570
Yeah.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.404
I know you tried
to fight this.

29:32.438 --> 29:33.405
Thank you.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.506
Hey. The surgery
went well.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.142
Oh, thank God.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.310
Yeah, he has full function
of his lower extremities.

29:38.344 --> 29:39.846
Well, that's good.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.147
I can take you
to him if you'd like.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.515
Yes, please.
Abby, come
walk with us.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.117
ELENA:
Did you get
the bullet out?

29:45.151 --> 29:46.853
DUBENKO:
You know, the strangest
thing happened.

29:46.886 --> 29:48.988
I removed the bullet, uh,
placed it on a mayo stand.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.923
Then there was a bleeder,
things got a little hectic,

29:50.957 --> 29:52.324
stand got knocked over,

29:52.358 --> 29:53.893
and the bullet
somehow went missing.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.294
Went missing?

29:55.327 --> 29:57.396
Yeah, the cop's been looking
for it for over an hour.

29:57.429 --> 30:00.432
I don't know-- it
just sort of vanished.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.334
Oh.

30:02.368 --> 30:03.903
Well, can I go in?

30:03.936 --> 30:05.237
Yeah, absolutely.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.907
Thank you.

30:11.978 --> 30:13.545
Vanished?

30:13.579 --> 30:17.383
Yeah. Weird, right?

30:23.956 --> 30:25.391
Your kidneys look good,

30:25.424 --> 30:26.993
and the blood is clearing
from your urine.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.427
So, I don't
need surgery?

30:28.460 --> 30:29.962
Doesn't look
that way.

30:29.996 --> 30:32.331
And the baby's
going to be okay?

30:32.364 --> 30:33.599
No CT, no radiation.

30:33.632 --> 30:34.901
Everything should be fine.

30:34.934 --> 30:37.369
Thank you, doctors.
So much.

30:37.403 --> 30:40.973
We'll get you upstairs
as soon as the bed's ready.

30:41.007 --> 30:43.209
Hey, uh,
Dr. Moretti?

30:43.242 --> 30:44.610
Kevin.

30:44.643 --> 30:47.046
All right, um,
I just wanted to say

30:47.079 --> 30:48.614
that the ultrasound
was a good idea,

30:48.647 --> 30:52.318
and it's a good thing that
we did it, so, you know...

30:52.351 --> 30:53.652
You're welcome.
All right.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.487
Maybe next time
you'll think twice

30:55.521 --> 30:57.123
before selling me out
to Anspaugh

30:57.156 --> 30:58.624
and trying to steal my job.

30:58.657 --> 31:00.492
Wait. I wasn't
trying to steal...
Don't lie.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.428
It belittles us both.

31:03.429 --> 31:06.032
(sighs)

31:08.334 --> 31:11.103
Um, we're going
to get an ETA on your bed.

31:11.137 --> 31:14.673
You think I'm some kind of
terrible person, don't you?

31:14.706 --> 31:16.475
(sighs)

31:16.508 --> 31:17.944
He was a kid,
you were his teacher.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.311
I'm only nine years older.

31:19.345 --> 31:22.148
A few years from now,
no one would care.

31:22.181 --> 31:25.084
But now they do.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.954
(teary):
I just can't believe he's gone.

31:29.989 --> 31:30.656
Ma'am...

31:30.689 --> 31:33.259
you need some help.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.661
His mom showed up
at my house this morning.

31:35.694 --> 31:38.397
Told me to stay away
from her son.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.166
You can't really blame her.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.268
Things got heated,
we had a fight.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.370
I hit my head,
and she ran off.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.637
That's when
I called

31:45.671 --> 31:47.639
Casey.

31:47.673 --> 31:50.342
If only she had left us alone.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.988
(sighs)

32:14.733 --> 32:17.036
We were going
through a rough time.

32:19.738 --> 32:22.508
He'd shut
himself off,

32:22.541 --> 32:24.410
stayed in
his room...

32:31.117 --> 32:33.285
But things were
getting better.

32:37.389 --> 32:40.026
He was starting
to talk to me again.

32:46.665 --> 32:49.468
(quietly exhales)

32:53.272 --> 32:54.740
I just don't understand
why it's taking so long.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.109
I thought my case for custody
was as strong as...

32:57.143 --> 32:59.111
Because that's what you said.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.280
Well, that's not good enough.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.581
(sighs):
I'm sorry.

33:02.614 --> 33:03.649
I know you filed
the papers,

33:03.682 --> 33:04.516
you're doing
all you can.

33:04.550 --> 33:07.086
I gotta go. Thanks.

33:07.119 --> 33:08.320
You didn't have
to do that.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.655
Oh, yes, I did.
Hi, Dr. Gates.

33:09.688 --> 33:10.689
I know.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.358
Joshua's been raving
about you.

33:12.391 --> 33:13.725
I'm Serena, his mom.

33:13.759 --> 33:14.793
He's a great kid.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.662
Yep. A handful.

33:16.695 --> 33:18.097
He made me go to the library

33:18.130 --> 33:22.168
to pick up some books
he'd put on hold.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.670
So, has he talked to you
about what's going on?

33:24.703 --> 33:26.072
Yeah.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.273
It sounds pretty
straightforward.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.640
Straightforward?

33:28.674 --> 33:30.276
I don't mean to sound
cavalier about pneumonia,

33:30.309 --> 33:33.245
but he's so much better today
than he was yesterday.

33:33.279 --> 33:36.282
I'm really relieved.

33:36.315 --> 33:37.349
Excuse me, I have
to fill out some

33:37.383 --> 33:39.618
insurance thing for the clerk.

33:39.651 --> 33:40.652
Okay. Nice to meet you.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.454
Mm, and, uh,

33:42.488 --> 33:44.556
don't let my kid run the place.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.658
He's got that kind
of personality.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.660
All right, I'll try
to keep him in check.

33:53.599 --> 33:56.602
You didn't tell her.

33:56.635 --> 34:00.506
I started to,
but... couldn't.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.209
Joshua...

34:03.242 --> 34:04.810
she has to know.

34:04.843 --> 34:06.645
So when she comes
back later,

34:06.678 --> 34:09.781
you and I will tell
her together, okay?

34:09.815 --> 34:12.384
I can't see the look on her face

34:12.418 --> 34:14.620
when she realizes I'm gonna die.

34:19.525 --> 34:21.127
You do it?

34:23.795 --> 34:25.563
You know what, you guys?

34:25.597 --> 34:27.366
I'm not really sure I'm
in the mood for this tonight.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.434
You're just nervous.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.701
No, it's not that.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.469
Come on, Sam,
shake it off.

34:31.503 --> 34:33.139
This is gonna
be fun.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.373
Come on.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.210
Oh, I knew this.

34:38.244 --> 34:43.415
Just let me say that we are the
hottest girls up in this place.

34:43.449 --> 34:45.417
Wow, a lot of people
signed up for this.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.152
It's a numbers
game, Sam.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.155
And I like
the odds.

34:49.188 --> 34:52.791
DAWN:
Wouldn't it be great if tonight
we all met our soul mates?

34:52.824 --> 34:54.326
Three cosmos, please.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.228
I would just be happy
to meet a nice guy

34:56.262 --> 34:58.230
and go on a nice date.

34:58.264 --> 34:59.331
We're happy you came
with us tonight.

34:59.365 --> 35:00.699
It's about time.

35:00.732 --> 35:02.401
I know, I know,
I got to get out there.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.203
Life is too damn short.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.371
Yes, it is.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.805
Yeah, I will drink to that.

35:07.839 --> 35:10.376
Toast.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.411
To falling in love.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.813
To sex without batteries.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.815
(all laugh)

35:16.848 --> 35:19.351
(horn blares)

35:19.385 --> 35:21.487
Oh, come on,
come on, come on.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.854
That's it.

35:22.888 --> 35:24.790
I'm gonna go get me some.

35:25.657 --> 35:27.193
I was thinking

35:27.226 --> 35:28.694
maybe you should
stay at our place,

35:28.727 --> 35:30.229
till you get better.

35:30.262 --> 35:31.697
Oh, no, I can't do that.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.432
Well, at least while
Luka's out of town.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.633
I don't want to impose.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.867
Ooh, hey, hold
that elevator.

35:35.901 --> 35:37.503
Going down.

35:37.536 --> 35:38.737
And I wouldn't
want you to think

35:38.770 --> 35:41.340
you had to wait on me
hand and foot.

35:41.373 --> 35:43.375
Believe me,
that'll never happen.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.212
Come on.

35:46.212 --> 35:47.779
It'll be fun--
you, me and Joe.

35:47.813 --> 35:49.581
You know, you already
have a lot on your plate.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.350
Neela, your taxi's
out front.

35:51.383 --> 35:52.651
Take care of
yourself.
Thanks, Frank.

35:52.684 --> 35:55.487
Yeah, but it's so quiet
with Luka away.

35:55.521 --> 35:57.489
And besides, I could use
some free baby-sitting.

35:57.523 --> 36:00.492
I guess Joe needs to get
to know his Auntie Neela.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.494
Yeah.
But isn't Luka
coming home soon?

36:02.528 --> 36:04.496
I hope so,
but I don't know.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.698
His trip is taking
longer than we thought.

36:06.732 --> 36:08.500
Oh, it's got to
be hard for him

36:08.534 --> 36:09.601
without you
and Joe.
Yeah.

36:09.635 --> 36:10.902
I mean, he misses us,

36:10.936 --> 36:12.804
but you know,
on some level,

36:12.838 --> 36:15.441
I think he's really happy
in Croatia, you know?

36:15.474 --> 36:16.475
He's comfortable there.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.244
I can hear it in his voice.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.511
What do you think?

36:19.545 --> 36:21.280
Thank you.
I'd love to stay.

36:21.313 --> 36:22.381
Okay, great.
Okay.

36:22.414 --> 36:23.682
Uh, Joe's nanny
will let you in,

36:23.715 --> 36:24.816
and there's leftover
Thai food in the fridge

36:24.850 --> 36:26.585
and I'll be home
in a little while.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.620
All right, brilliant.
I'll see you then.
Okay.

36:28.654 --> 36:30.489
Bye.
Bye.

36:31.990 --> 36:33.859
That waiting room looks
like a ghost town in there.

36:33.892 --> 36:34.993
It's a great job today.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.362
Thank you.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.863
And it was such
a pleasure.

36:37.896 --> 36:39.431
Oh, I'm so glad you enjoyed it

36:39.465 --> 36:40.832
because you'll be
doing it again tomorrow.

36:44.636 --> 36:47.273
Good night, Abby.

36:47.306 --> 36:48.774
Dr. Lockhart,

36:48.807 --> 36:50.409
got a minute?

36:51.710 --> 36:52.978
It's an all-day
bridge tournament.

36:53.011 --> 36:54.613
You'll be bored
out of your mind.

36:54.646 --> 36:55.914
Teach me to play.

36:55.947 --> 36:57.015
I already have
a partner.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.017
Yeah, but who's
better looking?

36:59.050 --> 37:00.686
I'd say a toss up.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.489
He is 78, very
distinguished

37:03.522 --> 37:04.956
and he knows what
a shallot is.

37:04.990 --> 37:05.957
What do you call
that thing?
(doorbell chimes)

37:05.991 --> 37:08.294
It's an onion.
(laughs)

37:08.327 --> 37:09.528
Aren't they the same?

37:09.561 --> 37:10.862
No.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.364
Morris!

37:12.398 --> 37:13.765
Hey, look, now,
now I can "challa"

37:13.799 --> 37:14.866
at you all through dinner.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.468
Get it? Challa?
Ha, ha.

37:16.502 --> 37:17.669
Hi.

37:17.703 --> 37:19.305
Where's, uh,
Hope?

37:19.305 --> 37:21.006
Oh, uh, she's not coming.

37:21.039 --> 37:22.441
She's, she's sick.

37:22.474 --> 37:23.909
Oh, that's
too bad.

37:23.942 --> 37:24.743
(sighs)

37:24.776 --> 37:26.645
Sick of me.

37:26.678 --> 37:27.546
What?

37:27.579 --> 37:28.547
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:28.580 --> 37:29.681
Maybe I, maybe
I should go.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.350
I don't want to burden
you with this.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.352
Oh, no, no, no, don't
be silly. Stay.
Okay.

37:33.385 --> 37:36.322
But I completely lost
my appetite, though.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.927
I built a time machine
in my garage.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.631
(horn blares)

37:49.901 --> 37:52.971
I really plan on sticking
with women this time.

37:53.004 --> 37:54.440
(horn blares)

37:54.473 --> 37:58.844
What's the oldest guy
you've ever balled?

38:01.613 --> 38:03.649
(horn blares)

38:09.087 --> 38:13.392
I hear you'd never
date a cop.

38:13.425 --> 38:14.593
How did...

38:17.763 --> 38:19.931
I am going to kill
Chuny and Dawn.

38:19.965 --> 38:24.736
(chuckling):
I like the new look.

38:24.770 --> 38:25.771
Thanks.

38:25.804 --> 38:26.938
Um...

38:26.972 --> 38:28.474
So what's your beef?

38:28.507 --> 38:31.810
We're Chicago's finest.

38:31.843 --> 38:35.781
Uh, just in my line of work
I see you guys get hurt.

38:35.814 --> 38:39.117
Shot and killed.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.020
So you'd worry about me?

38:42.053 --> 38:44.055
Yeah, I guess I would.

38:44.089 --> 38:45.624
And I'd worry about you, too.

38:45.657 --> 38:46.858
Really?

38:46.892 --> 38:48.627
I see the people
that come into County.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.896
Drunks,
the drug seekers.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.731
It's a pretty dangerous place.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.099
On second thought, maybe
I shouldn't date a nurse.

38:54.132 --> 38:55.967
(laughs)

38:56.001 --> 38:57.969
(horn blares)

39:00.772 --> 39:02.641
You like Italian food?

39:02.674 --> 39:03.809
I love it.

39:03.842 --> 39:04.976
I know this great place
over on State.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.845
My buddy owns it.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.914
Hey, you're holding
everybody up.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.416
Time to go.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.121
Yes, it is.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.456
(horn blares)

39:20.592 --> 39:23.028
I think it's great
that she wants to go do

39:23.061 --> 39:24.530
a medical mission
in Caracas.

39:24.563 --> 39:25.831
I-I-I really do.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.599
But, but, I have
a job, okay?

39:27.633 --> 39:29.435
I-I have a life here.

39:29.468 --> 39:31.437
You have any more
of this cake left?

39:31.437 --> 39:32.904
She'll be back
before you know it.

39:32.938 --> 39:34.540
I just can't help but
think that this trip

39:34.573 --> 39:37.108
is just an elaborate
excuse to break up.

39:37.142 --> 39:38.143
Have you ever considered
the possibility

39:38.176 --> 39:39.678
that it's not
about you?

39:39.711 --> 39:40.746
I mean, the long
distance thing

39:40.779 --> 39:42.681
never ends well,
does it?

39:42.714 --> 39:43.915
Morris, you're not listening.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.984
This isn't about
your relationship.

39:46.017 --> 39:47.953
It's about Hope
and doing something

39:47.986 --> 39:49.621
that's important to her.

39:49.655 --> 39:51.790
I mean, you gotta
respect that.
I do.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.992
I do, but living
in a tent city

39:54.025 --> 39:55.461
without running water

39:55.461 --> 39:56.962
or a toilet is not
my idea of fun.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.097
All right, I get it,
it's not your thing.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.633
That's okay.
I know, but...

40:01.667 --> 40:04.636
Look, just, just give her
some breathing room.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.037
Hope is smart
and independent

40:06.071 --> 40:07.072
and that's the reason
why you like her

40:07.105 --> 40:09.675
in the first place, right?

40:09.708 --> 40:11.910
But what if she
meets somebody else,

40:11.943 --> 40:15.581
some hunky
humanitarian type?

40:15.614 --> 40:17.783
You're just gonna
have to trust her.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.794
Hey, Lucien, hey.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.762
Um...

40:30.796 --> 40:34.132
The police found a large
sum of money and a gun

40:34.165 --> 40:36.234
in Carlos and Elena's
apartment.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.202
Well, a lot of
people have guns.

40:37.235 --> 40:39.605
Yeah, $1,830.

40:39.638 --> 40:43.174
The exact amount stolen
from the mini-mart.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.743
You think after years
of doing this

40:44.776 --> 40:46.478
you start to get
a handle on people.

40:46.512 --> 40:48.547
The reality is,
everybody lies

40:48.580 --> 40:49.981
and manipulates
to get what they want.

40:50.015 --> 40:52.117
I believed them, too.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.152
Everybody.

40:56.655 --> 40:57.823
It's sad.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.224
Okay, I'll call
the police,

40:59.257 --> 41:00.692
let them know somebody
found their bullet.

41:00.726 --> 41:02.160
Hey, Lucien...

41:02.193 --> 41:05.030
It was lodged into a crevice
in the anesthesia cart.

41:05.063 --> 41:06.865
Strangest thing.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.534
Night, Abby.

41:11.202 --> 41:13.539
Good night.

41:48.073 --> 41:51.042
He looks like a little boy
when he sleeps.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.847
He's a cool kid.

41:55.881 --> 41:58.316
The antibiotics seem
to be working.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.619
You think he'll be
coming home soon?

42:00.652 --> 42:02.087
(sighs)

42:02.120 --> 42:04.089
Serena, there's something
I need to tell you.

42:04.122 --> 42:05.891
What?

42:05.924 --> 42:07.258
Joshua has a...

42:07.292 --> 42:09.595
a neuromuscular
disease.

42:09.595 --> 42:10.862
What?

42:10.896 --> 42:12.798
It affects the nerves
in the brain

42:12.831 --> 42:14.733
which allow him to
breathe and swallow...

42:14.766 --> 42:17.268

42:18.904 --> 42:21.773
