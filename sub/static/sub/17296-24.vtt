Ah-ha!
Found the feather in the hump.

00:27.984 --> 00:30.247
Beach ball! In the other hump.

00:30.291 --> 00:31.161
Good eye.

00:31.205 --> 00:33.120
Broccoli, in the cloud. Boom.

00:33.163 --> 00:37.298
Ooh, and on the other side of the
treasure box, there is the rocket ship.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.908
Well done, Titans.

00:38.951 --> 00:40.301
Waddup! Waddup!

00:40.344 --> 00:43.217
Oh, snap!
A hidden pics puzzle.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.392
I loves these.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.046
Only one more hidden pic.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.396
Who will be the first
to find the dolphin?

00:49.527 --> 00:51.877
Ha! Found a palm tree, yo.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.270
Ha-ha!

00:53.314 --> 00:54.924
Uh, you're supposed to find
the hidden pictures,

00:54.967 --> 00:56.404
not the obvious ones.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.188
Oh, yeah. I knows.

00:58.232 --> 01:01.061
I was just warming up
my peepers, mama.

01:05.239 --> 01:08.546
Dude, every time you try these
puzzles, you get super frustrated.

01:08.590 --> 01:11.941
Maybe you should play some
dumb video games instead?

01:11.984 --> 01:15.945
Nah, I'm gonna find this
dolphin, yo. I can dos it.

01:15.988 --> 01:17.120
Ooh! Found it.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.252
Me too.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.818
Ooh, yeah, there it is.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.691
Ah! I also see it.
Next to the...

01:22.734 --> 01:25.259
Don't say it!
I wants to find it on my own.

01:33.397 --> 01:34.833
I can't finds nothing.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.661
This pic is hidden too good.

01:36.705 --> 01:38.315
The there, the there.

01:38.359 --> 01:39.969
It is not you.

01:40.012 --> 01:41.405
It is your brain.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.667
My brain's is fine.

01:42.711 --> 01:44.930
I just gots to use all my lobes.

01:44.974 --> 01:48.020
My earlobes, my lobey lobes,
my frontal lobes.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.761
All types of lobes.

01:49.805 --> 01:52.503
Sorry, Beast Boy, but using your
entire brain is impossible.

01:52.547 --> 01:56.377
It is a fact that we humans
only use 10% of our brains.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.118
Two percent in your case.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.163
Actually, that's a common
misconception.

02:00.207 --> 02:03.514
We use all parts of our brain
at all times.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.212
The 10% myth
is basically just used

02:05.255 --> 02:07.779
to make plots for books,
TV shows, and movies.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.695
Would the
television book movie shows

02:10.739 --> 02:12.523
truly say something untrue?

02:12.567 --> 02:13.611
Of course not.

02:16.571 --> 02:20.749
So, you're saying, if I use
more percentages of my brain,

02:20.792 --> 02:22.229
I can do this puzzle?

02:22.272 --> 02:23.969
I guess, yeah.

02:24.013 --> 02:26.407
So, how's am I supposed to get some
more of them brain percentages?

02:26.450 --> 02:28.452
Well, like any muscle
in the body,

02:28.496 --> 02:30.411
your brain needs exercise.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.195
Exercise my brain, huh?

02:36.286 --> 02:38.245
It's so small.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.116
And the shriveled.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.813
Not for much longer, yo.

02:41.857 --> 02:44.599
I'm about to get this brain
into shape.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.802
What's with the Shakespeare
pants, dude?

03:13.845 --> 03:16.805
Ten percentage of my brain,
I doth now employ.

03:16.848 --> 03:20.287
Henceforth, thou mayeth
call me, Renaissance Boy.

03:20.330 --> 03:23.072
Ooh, your word usage
and feather hat suggest

03:23.115 --> 03:25.596
the increased intellect,
Renaissance Boy.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.381
Indubitably, yo.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.861
And now I shall find
yon hidden pic.

03:29.905 --> 03:32.647
Mine eyes
it shall no longer trick.

03:38.740 --> 03:42.700
Forsooth, me thinks this puzzle is
the vile work of a mad alchemist.

03:42.744 --> 03:43.875
You really don't see it?

03:43.919 --> 03:47.270
Nay. I needeth more
brain percentages.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.750
Well, you're at 10%.

03:48.793 --> 03:50.621
That's the maximum amount
a person can use.

03:50.665 --> 03:53.450
I'm telling you, dude, that's
not how the brain works.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.669
Of course, it is.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.758
I saw it in several,
very similar movies.

03:56.801 --> 04:00.370
Yeah. Would there be several movies with
the same premise if it wasn't true?

04:00.414 --> 04:02.198
Sounds logic, milady.

04:02.242 --> 04:06.942
Henceforth, I shalt endeavor to
unlock my brains true potential.

04:08.378 --> 04:11.642
So the duck says,
"Put it on my bill."

04:15.646 --> 04:18.127
Oh, bro, always using
that sense of humor

04:18.170 --> 04:20.825
to hide the painful conflict
in your soul.

04:20.869 --> 04:23.741
Do your cybernetics make you
less of a man or more?

04:23.785 --> 04:26.788
Either way, you is a misfit
of the human race, brother.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.180
That's...

04:28.224 --> 04:29.225
You're...

04:29.269 --> 04:30.313
Oh, my goodness.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.665
That was not the nice thing
to say, Beast Boy.

04:34.709 --> 04:37.886
My bad. I'm using 50%
of my brains now.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.497
So, I gots all these deep
insights about people.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.760
You know, like how Robin's
always trying to be cool

04:42.804 --> 04:46.634
to compensate for how he used to
wear short shorts and elf boots.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.636
It's true.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.769
Or like how Raven won't
never feel no deep emotions

04:51.813 --> 04:53.249
like the rest of us.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.120
'Cause if she did, she might
lose control of herself

04:55.164 --> 04:58.123
and destroy the world
like her dad wants her to.

04:58.167 --> 05:02.345
My heart is empty.

05:02.389 --> 05:05.566
And how poor Starfire
is desperate to make friends.

05:05.609 --> 05:08.003
'Cause she's the only alien
on this entire planet

05:08.046 --> 05:09.744
and that makes her, you know,

05:09.787 --> 05:12.312
super isolated and sad.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.967
I am the alone.

05:21.843 --> 05:24.933
Why are you doing this, man?

05:24.976 --> 05:27.675
So's I can solve
this puzzle, yo.

05:27.718 --> 05:28.980
Speaking of which...

05:33.420 --> 05:36.161
Still not smart enough.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.903
I needs more brain percentages.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.645
I do not like the smart
Beast Boy.

05:41.689 --> 05:42.994
He makes me the sad.

05:43.038 --> 05:46.128
What if he manages
to unlock 100% of his brain?

05:46.171 --> 05:48.086
He could become a serious threat

05:48.130 --> 05:50.175
to my self-esteem.

05:50.219 --> 05:53.570
Deep down, he's still our
dumb, lovable, Beast Boy.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.659
We just need a way
to get him back.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.574
And I think I know how.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.230
Yo, Beastie!

06:01.273 --> 06:04.102
Let's play some dumb video games.

06:04.146 --> 06:05.582
No way!

06:05.626 --> 06:08.106
I'll lose
all my brain percentages.

06:08.150 --> 06:09.020
That's the idea.

06:09.064 --> 06:10.631
We loved you the way you were.

06:10.674 --> 06:13.198
A sweet guy with 2% brain power.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.070
That Beast Boy is gone.

06:15.113 --> 06:18.508
I'm using 80% of my brain now.

06:18.552 --> 06:19.596
Check this out.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.164
Whoa. Telekinesis?

06:22.207 --> 06:24.514
Yep. That's what happens
when you use

06:24.558 --> 06:27.212
the extra percentages
of your brain.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.475
I can do this too.

06:38.876 --> 06:39.921
What!

06:39.964 --> 06:41.009
No way!

06:41.052 --> 06:43.228
So much brain power.

06:43.272 --> 06:44.621
But not enough.

06:44.665 --> 06:47.276
Hold up, I gotta do something
real quick.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.073
Oh, snap!

07:02.117 --> 07:04.989
Waddup, monkey man?
Let's touch fingers.

07:20.178 --> 07:21.528
Sick.

07:23.268 --> 07:24.444
Where'd you go, dude?

07:24.487 --> 07:27.185
On a journey through my own DNA

07:27.229 --> 07:29.057
to the beginning of time.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.625
Me and a monkey man
touched fingertips

07:31.668 --> 07:35.498
and then I saw all the secrets
of the universe.

07:35.542 --> 07:39.720
Now, I'm using 95% of my brain

07:39.763 --> 07:43.680
and I'm going to turn
into a computer!

07:49.251 --> 07:51.688
I do not understand
what is the happening.

07:51.732 --> 07:55.518
That's cause you only use
10% of your brains.

07:55.562 --> 07:57.302
If you was like me,

07:57.346 --> 08:01.306
you could touch monkeys
and be computers too.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.221
Beastie, you gotta
lock it up, man.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.875
This is too much power.

08:04.919 --> 08:08.357
It ain't enough!
I'm about to get to 100%.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.924
Then, what will you do?

08:09.967 --> 08:12.187
Eliminate reality.

08:13.623 --> 08:15.016
We have to do something.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.539
Once he gets to 100%,

08:16.583 --> 08:18.454
we won't be able to stop him.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.629
Titans! Go!

08:28.986 --> 08:30.422
Where are we?

08:30.466 --> 08:31.902
We're inside the puzzle.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.034
Beast Boy...

08:33.077 --> 08:34.209
What have you done?

08:34.252 --> 08:36.341
I removed all distractions

08:36.385 --> 08:39.083
so I can finally find
the hidden pics.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.042
You gotta restore reality, dude.

08:41.085 --> 08:44.045
Not until I finish
the puzzle, bro.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.004
I can see.

08:47.048 --> 08:49.529
I can see!

08:49.572 --> 08:53.533
Rocket ship, beach ball,
feather, broccoli.

08:53.576 --> 08:55.447
Come on, little buddy, one more.

08:55.491 --> 08:56.971
You can do it.

09:00.714 --> 09:03.281
You gotta be kidding me.
It's right there!

09:03.325 --> 09:04.413
Look, it is in the...

09:04.456 --> 09:07.677
No! No hints.
I'm gonna do it myself.

09:07.721 --> 09:09.549
Even if it takes forever.

09:17.295 --> 09:18.427
A dolphin!

09:21.473 --> 09:23.214
Ah, so obvious.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.521
They should really
make these puzzles harder.

09:27.610 --> 09:28.655
We're back.

09:28.698 --> 09:30.613
Beastie, you did it!

09:30.657 --> 09:32.310
That's what's up!

09:32.354 --> 09:35.531
So, now that you have the
unlimited power of your brain,

09:35.575 --> 09:36.837
- what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.882
I ain't thought that far ahead.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.145
Hey! They gots mazes in here.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.886
I'm great at mazes.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.192
Huh...

09:48.762 --> 09:50.894
Yes, it's this way.
I knows it.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.290
Oh, man, we ain't never gettin' outta here.
