WEBVTT

00:01.359 --> 00:02.560
 Where's Stephen?

00:02.560 --> 00:04.480
 He's dead.

00:04.480 --> 00:07.200
 What are we going to do?

00:07.200 --> 00:10.600
 The Board commissioned an
 independent feasibility study
 and I smell trouble.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.240
 This is a helluva way to
 hold a reunion, isn't it?

00:13.240 --> 00:14.240
 Margaret?

00:14.240 --> 00:18.240
 I've thought of you on and off
 for the last 45 years.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.760
 A woman never forgets
 the first man she slept with.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.760
 Everybody likes you, just a sweet
 small-town girl, uncomplicated.

01:52.360 --> 01:56.360
 The naked eye, window to the world
 and mirror of our soul.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.600
 Hopefully your rotation
 in ophthalmology

01:59.600 --> 02:01.400
 will unveil some of the mystery.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.080
 Make you a little more clinical.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.320
 Only question I need answered,
 what's this snotty glob
 from the tear duct?

02:06.320 --> 02:10.320
 Look, Dr Craig's told me about you
 so consider this fair warning.

02:10.680 --> 02:14.680
 I won't put up with any
 sophomoric behaviour, understand?

02:16.800 --> 02:19.880
 Dr Freedman, up until now
 I've had perfect vision,

02:19.880 --> 02:22.800
 but lately there have
 been headaches, blurriness.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.720
 Any idea what the problem is?

02:24.720 --> 02:28.720
 Almost anything can make
 the picture fuzzy, but...

02:29.840 --> 02:33.840
 ..the truth is we still can't
 fully explain how we see.

02:36.440 --> 02:39.760
 Light enters the pupil.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.040
 Images are focused on the retina.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.880
 Lean in, please.

02:44.880 --> 02:48.840
 Nerve cells in 20 parts
 of the brain are stimulated,

02:48.840 --> 02:51.440
 performing 10 billion
 calculations per second.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.720
 What happens after
 that's anyone's guess.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.000
 The lowest line you can read?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.600
 L-P-E-D...

02:57.600 --> 03:00.400
 But I'm a heart surgeon.

03:00.400 --> 03:02.080
 Bottom line?

03:02.080 --> 03:05.280
 P-E-Z-O-L-C-F-T-D.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.160
 My career is the bottom line.

03:08.160 --> 03:12.120
 In the LR I can't even tell the
 distal branch of the right coronary.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.000
 Dr Wade, you don't need to worry.
 You're far-sighted.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.640
 I have to wear glasses?

03:16.640 --> 03:18.440
 For reading, working up close.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.200
 Operating. Will they fog up
 or slip down your nose?

03:21.200 --> 03:23.920
 There are always contact lenses
 giving even better vision.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.920
 Besides, you know what they
 say about passes and glasses.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.040
 I was not speeding.

03:31.040 --> 03:33.520
 Oh, we were going so
 fast the telegraph poles

03:33.520 --> 03:34.960
 looked like a picket fence.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.560
 Perhaps on the days you do volunteer
 work you should take your own car.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.880
 Now, Daniel, don't get defensive
 except when you're driving.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.640
 Thank you.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.200
 That'll be fine. Thank you.

03:46.200 --> 03:50.200
 Margaret.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.080
 Danny?

03:52.080 --> 03:54.280
 You look wonderful.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.880
 I'm sorry I can't make
 goo-goo eyes at you, my boy.

03:56.880 --> 04:00.440
 Cataracts.
 I'm here for out-patient surgery.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.040
 I go under the knife in a few hours.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.040
 Margaret Ryan, I'd like you
 to meet my wife, Catherine.

04:06.040 --> 04:06.800
 Hello.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.680
 The girl who stole my beau.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.640
 You're being melodramatic.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.120
 Between our break-up and my marriage
 there was an entire world war.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.600
 May I help you upstairs?

04:15.600 --> 04:17.160
 Oh, it's all right, thank you.

04:17.160 --> 04:21.160
 No, no, please, it's part of my
 job, I'm with the Women's Auxiliary.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.400
 Good for you!

04:22.400 --> 04:26.400
 Daniel never thought that
 I had enough social conscience.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.440
 Let's not dredge up old arguments.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.280
 Then just grab my bag.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.640
 You're getting to be
 a regular little Goldilocks.

04:34.640 --> 04:38.640
 You know when your daddy was your age
 he barely had hair, just soft down.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.480
 But a beautiful baby.

04:41.480 --> 04:44.320
 Everyone decent?
 Boy in the girls' dorm.

04:44.320 --> 04:47.160
 Let's go, Ellen, so Moser
 and his men can get cracking.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.720
 What's happening here, Mark?

04:48.720 --> 04:51.560
 We talked about redecorating
 but we never set a date.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.880
 I did. No use waiting. To make
 this room fit for our princess

04:54.880 --> 04:57.760
 no expense should be spared.
 Forget I said that, Moser.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.440
 Oh, and have your boys lug
 these up to the attic, huh?

05:01.440 --> 05:04.720
 They've been sitting here ever
 since they were sent back from OSU.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.600
 Don't touch those!
 I haven't had a chance to open them.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.600
 Would you excuse us, please?

05:12.000 --> 05:15.240
 Mark, I'm not sure that
 we should redo this room.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.120
 Oh, for crying out loud, Ellen.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.880
 This was your idea!

05:18.880 --> 05:22.880
 I mean, you got so excited about
 hanging frilly lace curtains

05:23.480 --> 05:26.440
 and mixing the right shade of paint,

05:26.440 --> 05:29.760
 finding the softest shag carpet.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.320
 Lay your peepers on this, Babs.

05:31.320 --> 05:33.840
 That wily woodpecker
 got away again.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.600
 Mark, this just isn't a good time.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.880
 Now let's get to the hospital.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.240
 I don't want Barbara to be late
 for her check-up with Dr Carlisle.

05:43.240 --> 05:46.880
 No, I don't, come on, Barbara.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.040
 Come on, Barbara.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.720
 Come on, sweetheart.

05:50.720 --> 05:53.880
 Listen, Moser, change of plan.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.360
 Hop in your truck,
 park down the street.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.600
 After we leave, come
 back and get cooking.

05:58.600 --> 06:01.640
 The side door will
 be unlocked, got that?

06:01.640 --> 06:05.640
 Let's hope your touch with the brush
 is better than your gift for gab.

06:13.080 --> 06:14.120
 What are we doing?

06:14.120 --> 06:16.560
 Trying not to run up a
 heavy dry cleaning bill.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.600
 Looking for a contact lens.

06:18.600 --> 06:19.480
 Whose?

06:19.480 --> 06:22.680
 Mine. Keep your eyes peeled.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.440
 You don't wear contacts!

06:24.440 --> 06:26.240
 Found it!

06:26.240 --> 06:28.560
 Dr Friedman fitted me this morning.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.120
 Hard or soft?

06:29.120 --> 06:30.440
 Jack, don't be a pervert.

06:30.440 --> 06:32.600
 Jacky, your whole
 life is falling apart.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.120
 First your marriage, now your eyes.

06:34.120 --> 06:35.640
 First your marriage, now your eyes.
 Taking it all in stride.

06:35.640 --> 06:38.080
 You can't forget about your
 failed reconciliation with Robert.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.320
 You can't forget about your
 failed reconciliation with Robert.
 Wait a minute. What?

06:39.320 --> 06:42.120
 Jacky and Robert went up to
 Vermont to shoot a little quail.

06:42.120 --> 06:43.680
 Jacky and Robert went up to
 Vermont to shoot a little quail.
 A little beaver.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.440
 Then Robert decided not to
 get back together anyway.

06:46.440 --> 06:49.040
 No big deal. I've got
 a new positive outlook.

06:49.040 --> 06:52.560
 Going through life with
 your eyes wide open, scary.

06:52.560 --> 06:55.560
 All right, people. Heavy caseload
 today. Who's up first, please?

06:55.560 --> 06:59.560
 All right, people. Heavy caseload
 today. Who's up first, please?
 24-year-old male
 presented last night.

06:59.640 --> 07:02.520
 Er, well, actually,
 early this morning.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.280
 Anyway...

07:05.280 --> 07:07.240
  CAT MEWS

07:07.240 --> 07:09.040
 Wow. I wonder how he got inside?

07:09.040 --> 07:10.680
 Cat scratch fever.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.680
 Here, kitty, kitty.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.560
 All right, Dr Morrison, continue.

07:15.560 --> 07:19.560
 Patient complained of acute
 onset of abdominal pain...

07:24.760 --> 07:27.360
 Is Mrs Ryan all settled in?

07:27.360 --> 07:30.560
 Just after we reached her room
 an orderly arrived

07:30.560 --> 07:32.880
 and whisked her away to pre-op.

07:32.880 --> 07:35.160
 Then you didn't
 have a chance to talk?

07:35.160 --> 07:37.280
 About something in particular?

07:37.280 --> 07:38.960
 Me.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.360
 Her. Us.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.960
 Isn't that what women do, compare
 notes, give each other the skinny?

07:44.960 --> 07:46.840
 Well, you told me
 all I need to know.

07:46.840 --> 07:50.600
 Met in Greenwich Village,
 your room-mates were dating

07:50.600 --> 07:53.320
 and from there on,
 you did nothing but fight.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.200
 An exciting time.

07:55.200 --> 07:58.160
 The country was just
 coming out of the Depression,

07:58.160 --> 08:02.160
 prohibition had been repealed,
 the war was heating up.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.760
 Oh, would you pick that up?

08:04.760 --> 08:07.920
 Maggie used to drag me
 down to her apartment.

08:07.920 --> 08:11.200
 To meet all these oddball types.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.680
 She of course called them
 avant-garde.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.640
 I understand why you went steady.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.400
 She's very nice.

08:17.400 --> 08:21.400
 But your relationship
 is no business of mine.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.480
 It happened before
 we knew each other!

08:24.480 --> 08:26.480
 (CHUCKLES)

08:26.480 --> 08:30.480
 But the idea of you, a bohemian!

08:31.680 --> 08:34.000
 Why do you find that amusing?

08:34.000 --> 08:38.000
 Well, I... I just can't imagine you
 hanging out in dark smoky clubs,

08:40.280 --> 08:43.559
 wearing a beret,
 talking to EE Cummings,

08:43.559 --> 08:47.240
 drinking with Jo Cohen,
 talking, drinking...

08:47.240 --> 08:51.240
 There was an exchange of ideas. Also
 a certain freedom of spontaneity.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.000
 Oh, I'm sure there was.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.960
 Only I just can't see you
 part of that scene.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.960
 It must have been a flight of fancy.

09:01.960 --> 09:05.960
 You in a beret!

09:05.960 --> 09:09.960
 Do you think that Mrs Ungerbach
 would enjoy reading Watership Down?

09:11.120 --> 09:13.000
 I don't know Mrs Ungerbach,

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
 and what's more
 it's obvious you don't know me.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.720
 Whose move?

09:49.720 --> 09:53.680
 I ain't got no game going.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.720
 Hey man, give me my hat back!
 My hat!

09:56.720 --> 10:00.720
 You blind as a bat! Here you go,
 bat man. Here's your hat.

10:00.840 --> 10:03.760
 That's OK, man.
 You, you keep it, it's yours.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.760
 I don't need it.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.680
 How you gonna play
 chess if you can't see?

10:11.680 --> 10:13.560
 Oh, you just feel the pieces,

10:13.560 --> 10:15.840
 keeps the fingers quick
 and the mind sharp.

10:15.840 --> 10:18.960
 Sharp? Sharp,
 oh, we can show you sharp.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.960
 Showed the bat man sharp, Booboo.

10:24.720 --> 10:28.720
 Aah!

10:29.920 --> 10:33.080
 Periumbilical stab wound,
 possible concussion,

10:33.080 --> 10:35.240
 multiple contusions and lacerations.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.880
 Type in cross for six units and
 set up for a peritoneal lavage.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.480
 Damn, this place smells like death.

10:41.480 --> 10:43.240
 What hospital's you bring me to?

10:43.240 --> 10:44.880
 St Eligius.

10:44.880 --> 10:48.320
 I ain't deaf
 and I ain't senile either.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.920
 Looks like they stuck
 you pretty good, sir.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.640
 The name is Arthur Tibbits. Art.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.200
 What happened there, Art?

10:55.200 --> 10:58.720
 Oh, a couple of Johnnies
 just out of nowhere,

10:58.720 --> 11:01.920
 next thing I know I've
 got a shiv burning in my belly.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.680
 Art, I need to look at your eyes.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.840
 Well, they won't be looking
 back at you. Born this way.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.440
 Pupils may still indicate trauma.
 Eyes are key to diagnosis.

11:11.440 --> 11:15.440
 OK.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.400
 You know, I was just sitting around,

11:18.400 --> 11:22.400
 minding my P's and Q's
 and they whacked me real good, too.

11:22.800 --> 11:26.600
 But then I'm a ripe old melon,
 tougher than they'll ever be.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.280
 Art, since you lost consciousness
 I'd like for you to have an X-ray.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.400
 I ain't got no money to pay for it.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.800
 It's on us.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.360
 Oh, well in that case I'll take two!

11:35.360 --> 11:39.360
 (LAUGHS)

11:39.640 --> 11:43.640
 When Westphall gets going on
 a tangent, rounds go on forever.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.440
 My eyes feel like
 someone threw sand in them.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.360
 New contact lenses.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.720
 Something I've been
 meaning to ask you.

11:50.720 --> 11:52.880
 A little while back you just
 kissed me out of the blue.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.600
 It didn't mean a thing.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.760
 Then why did you do it?

11:55.760 --> 11:59.760
 You accused me of being a small-town
 girl, dull and predictable.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.440
 I just did something crazy,
 that's all.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.320
 You were just trying
 to scratch your nits.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.000
 Where, maybe I can reach it!

12:06.000 --> 12:07.200
 Wayne, that's my shirt.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.440
 From your suitcase.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.200
 I know it's a drag for you guys
 having all my junk here,

12:11.200 --> 12:15.200
 but it's no fiesta squatting
 in on-call and I don't need
 you pitting out my Oxfords.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.800
 Look, you've been living here
 for a week. Go find an apartment.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.880
 It's not easy finding a place.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.960
 It's not easy finding a place.
 Like when your father owns a condo.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.720
 It was a great write-off for dad
 'til he had to bail
 thanks to Grant Redman.

12:24.720 --> 12:26.560
 Why worry about the shirts,

12:26.560 --> 12:28.280
 think about Elliott
 stretching out your jockey shorts.

12:28.280 --> 12:32.240
 think about Elliott
 stretching out your jockey shorts.
 Wackadoo, wackadoo, very funny.

12:32.240 --> 12:35.160
 Dr Erlich, tell me what
 you know about cataracts.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.720
 Cataract, a luxury touring sedan!
 (CHUCKLES)

12:38.720 --> 12:41.280
 Actually it's a clouding of the lens

12:41.280 --> 12:43.600
 and the second leading
 cause of blindness.

12:43.600 --> 12:47.120
 Nothing can be done to prevent
 cataracts but after removal, vision

12:47.120 --> 12:50.680
 can be corrected with glasses,
 contacts or inter-ocular lenses.

12:50.680 --> 12:51.760
 Good.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.720
 Hey, I'm not a stooge.

12:53.720 --> 12:57.280
 Number 64 blade, Mo.

12:57.280 --> 12:58.400
 (SUCKS TEETH)

12:58.400 --> 12:59.600
 What's the problem?

12:59.600 --> 13:02.600
 Well, it's just that a knife,
 you know, touching the eye,

13:02.600 --> 13:05.400
 it's kind of like...
 Un Chien Andalou.

13:05.400 --> 13:09.400
 Dr Erlich, you need this optho-
 surgical rotation for your residency.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.040
 If you're unable to assist...

13:11.040 --> 13:12.360
 Uncle, uncle, I give.

13:12.360 --> 13:14.560
 I've planted close to 2000 IOLs.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.880
 I can do this procedure
 with my eyes closed.

13:16.880 --> 13:19.320
 An idea I could get behind.

13:19.320 --> 13:23.320
 After making a two mm cut in the
 cornea, I'll incise the lens capsule.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.720
 Here it is. All yellowed
 and the size of an aspirin.

13:28.720 --> 13:31.160
 We're replacing Mrs Ryan's
 natural lens

13:31.160 --> 13:33.560
 with one made of
 polymethyl methacrylate.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.080
 So that's it, huh?

13:35.080 --> 13:37.600
 She'll have normal vision
 again in the left eye.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.360
 After five weeks or so.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.280
 Dr Erlich, adjust the focus.

13:42.280 --> 13:46.280
 Sure.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.680
 What does Dr Craig do
 when you act like this?

13:49.680 --> 13:53.600
 Makes me stand in the cornea!

13:53.600 --> 13:56.120
 Dr Griffin, have you seen a cat?

13:56.120 --> 13:56.600
 As in miaow?

13:56.600 --> 13:58.800
 It's wandering loose
 around the halls.

13:58.800 --> 14:00.280
 It's bigger than a Shetland pony.

14:00.280 --> 14:01.760
 It's bigger than a Shetland pony.
 Call the MSPCA to catch it.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.280
 If he's as big as you say it is
 I hope they get here

14:04.280 --> 14:07.600
 before he needs to
 hit the litter box.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.640
 Mrs Craig?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.320
 Oh, where's Dr Carlisle?

14:11.320 --> 14:14.480
 Went into Phoenix, father's sick.
 She asked me to cover for her.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.120
 Oh.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.440
 I'm Dr Seth Griffin.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.200
 You're new?

14:17.200 --> 14:18.360
 First year.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.040
 How do you do?

14:20.040 --> 14:23.960
 I thought you and
 Dr Craig had a son.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.760
 Barbara's our granddaughter.

14:25.760 --> 14:28.640
 My son Stephen was killed
 in an auto accident last year.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.840
 Sorry.

14:30.840 --> 14:34.840
 Well, Barbara, let me pop you on the
 scale. I'll get down to business.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.360
 Her appetite's been great, Doctor.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.640
 This month we added
 strained chicken,

14:39.640 --> 14:41.600
 carrots, and chocolate ice-cream.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.920
 She does even better than me.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.360
 Stuck with cafeteria meals.

14:46.360 --> 14:46.800
 Why's that?

14:46.800 --> 14:50.800
 I was forced out of my place.
 I've been living at the hospital.

14:51.680 --> 14:55.680
 9,600 grams! Obviously loves
 her granny's cooking.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.600
 Barbara, don't be
 such a crab appleton.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.720
 Do you think she'll mind?

15:00.720 --> 15:02.480
 You can try.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.680
 Come here. Come here.

15:05.680 --> 15:09.680
 Come here. Here.

15:09.840 --> 15:13.360
 Did you grammy ever tell you
 about the great green room?

15:13.360 --> 15:16.160
 Three little bears on little chairs

15:16.160 --> 15:20.160
 and two kittens, two little mittens
 and a comb and a brush

15:20.360 --> 15:24.360
 and a bowl full of mush and a little
 old lady whispering, "Hush."

15:24.880 --> 15:26.600
 Goodnight Moon.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.640
 Yeah, it's one of the best
 memories I have about my mom,

15:29.640 --> 15:33.640
 before she died,
 reading that together.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.240
 Dr Griffin, why don't you come
 and stay with us for a while?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.240
 Mark would never admit it,

15:40.240 --> 15:43.080
 but he can still remember
 what a grind first year was.

15:43.080 --> 15:43.920
 That's very nice of you to offer.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.880
 That's very nice of you to offer.
 Part of being the chief
 of surgery's wife

15:46.880 --> 15:49.800
 is to look after St Eligius' own.

15:49.800 --> 15:53.800
 No, I'll find new digs soon.
 Thanks anyway though.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.640
 Mr Tibbit's X-rays?

16:02.640 --> 16:05.800
 Mm-hm. Just put 'em up.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.120
 Arthrogram is negative.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.400
 Debreeded the wound
 and stitched it closed.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.160
 Oh.

16:11.160 --> 16:12.280
 Lucky man.

16:12.280 --> 16:13.960
 How can we tell?

16:13.960 --> 16:16.840
 You know, I love when
 these things strobe.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.360
 Let's try board E.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.040
 What kind of scumbucket
 would beat up a blind man?

16:22.040 --> 16:26.040
 Beats me. I heard it happened
 near your old neighbourhood.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.720
 Gee, E works!

16:29.720 --> 16:31.440
 I bring good things to light.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.080
 He wasn't kidding.
 He really is a ripe old melon.

16:34.080 --> 16:37.600
 Obviously not his first thumping.
 No new trauma.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.840
 Well, send him on his way.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.440
 Phil, it's getting late.
 Art lives on the street.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.880
 If we admit him he can
 get a good night's sleep.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.400
 You're not a social worker
 and this is not the Holiday Inn.

16:48.400 --> 16:51.840
 I thought of anyone around
 here, you'd understand.

16:51.840 --> 16:55.400
 Carol, when it comes to patients
 we're supposed to be colour-blind.

16:55.400 --> 16:59.120
 Now discharge Mr Tibbits.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.400
 The great clan!

17:00.400 --> 17:03.560
 Erlich, cap it. Dr Friedman
 filled me in on your OR antics.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.720
 What? I was terrific.

17:04.720 --> 17:05.480
 In a pigs eye.

17:05.480 --> 17:06.640
 You wanted to see me?

17:06.640 --> 17:08.240
 Yeah, pack your things.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.079
 Mrs Craig fed me your sob story.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.720
 You'll be staying with us
 'til you find a place.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.920
 Hold the phone,
 muscling in on my turf?

17:14.920 --> 17:17.640
 Mark, good. Hi, Alan.
 Glad I caught you.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.200
 Me too. We're going
 for a record in here.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.000
 Ned Shell.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.640
 Mayer's nerdy assistant?

17:22.640 --> 17:25.040
 He's stopping by tomorrow,
 wants to discuss

17:25.040 --> 17:26.680
 the board's feasibility study
 and their recommendations.

17:26.680 --> 17:30.520
 the board's feasibility study
 and their recommendations.
 I'm not going to let the city
 sell this hospital if I have my say.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.840
 Good. You'll be there?

17:31.840 --> 17:34.240
 Oh, sorry, Donald.
 Patch it up yourself.

17:34.240 --> 17:38.240
 Tomorrow's the night that Barbara
 and I watch Alf. Everybody out, hmm?

17:38.680 --> 17:40.440
 I'll meet you downstairs.

17:40.440 --> 17:44.360
 How about if Seth stays at
 my apartment and I live with you?

17:44.360 --> 17:48.360
 I used to have a job
 working at the YMC of A.

17:49.240 --> 17:53.240
 Great giving rub downs, 'cos I was
 lousy at refereeing pick-up games!

17:54.280 --> 17:56.840
 You know seven years
 I was working there.

17:56.840 --> 17:59.960
 That's when I met the ace
 who built my chessboard.

17:59.960 --> 18:03.960
 Of course the ol' Y's gone now
 and nothin' to take its place.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.600
 Empty life.
 How do you like them apples?

18:07.600 --> 18:09.760
 Hey, you're pretty good.
 You get around well.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.200
 Well, pretty well.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.920
 Of course the old legs
 are tiring now.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.200
 Why don't we sit down a minute?

18:18.200 --> 18:20.160
 OK.

18:20.160 --> 18:24.160
 You know, I was just thinking
 about my friend, Carl Clooky.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.240
 The Clook, we used to call him.

18:27.240 --> 18:31.240
 A real fine man. Always kept me
 from tripping over myself.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.520
 Of course he never beat me at chess.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.480
 You're good, huh?

18:35.480 --> 18:39.480
 Maybe. I know a challenge
 when I hear it.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.440
 Carl still watch out for you?

18:42.440 --> 18:46.080
 You know, last winter,

18:46.080 --> 18:48.640
 out looking for food,

18:48.640 --> 18:50.840
 cans by the kerb,

18:50.840 --> 18:54.120
 snowplough came along
 and hit poor Clook.

18:54.120 --> 18:58.120
 Ambulance took him away and
 I haven't seen my friend since.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.480
 Who helps you?
 Where do you sleep?

19:03.480 --> 19:07.480
 In the daytime I keep movin'
 and at night there's a nice place

19:09.360 --> 19:12.360
 over by the electric plant
 over on Boston

19:12.360 --> 19:16.360
 and they got them steam vents
 and they put out a lot of heat.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.400
 Of course the best I've ever had
 was a cardboard box, a big one, too.

19:21.280 --> 19:25.280
 But somebody came along
 and crushed it.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.520
 Your move.

19:29.520 --> 19:33.520
 Art, I'm going to admit you.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.240
 Problem with your glasses, Elliot?

19:42.240 --> 19:45.680
 Oh, I gave a patient some
 bad news and he slugged me.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.480
 Torqued my goggles out of shape.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.640
 It happens to me all the time.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.680
 I didn't mean getting hit
 but bending my frames.

19:52.680 --> 19:56.680
 Oh, sir, mind if we try yours?

19:57.480 --> 20:01.480
 You know,

20:02.120 --> 20:05.440
 Donald, I've always rather
 fancied the style you wear.

20:05.440 --> 20:08.880
 Really? Numbers two.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.680
 Dr Westphall.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.480
 You know I've been thinking
 about taking a step up

20:14.480 --> 20:17.840
 to contemporary-style frames.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.320
 Comfortable, what do you think?

20:20.320 --> 20:21.400
 Natty.

20:21.400 --> 20:22.840
 The prescription's odd.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.320
 How about me?

20:24.320 --> 20:27.280
 You look like an artist.

20:27.280 --> 20:28.520
 Strong lenses!

20:28.520 --> 20:29.560
 And me?

20:29.560 --> 20:32.120
 Erm... distinguished.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.960
 Are these tinted, Donald?

20:33.960 --> 20:37.600
 No, I don't think so.

20:37.600 --> 20:41.600
 Gentlemen...

20:45.000 --> 20:49.000
  CAT MEWS

20:49.920 --> 20:53.920
 I thought I saw a pussy cat.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.960
 Just put your bags down anywhere.

20:56.960 --> 21:00.960
 I'll get the sheets
 for the roll-out.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.640
 Great den, Dr Craig.

21:06.640 --> 21:10.040
 I wouldn't know anymore it's
 always filled with house guests.

21:10.040 --> 21:13.120
 I was 36 before I had
 luggage as nice as that.

21:13.120 --> 21:17.120
 Isn't that right, Ellen?

21:17.480 --> 21:21.480
 Ellen!

21:21.480 --> 21:24.120
 Er, listen, make yourself useful.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.440
 Take Barbara downstairs.

21:25.440 --> 21:29.440
 Sure.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.440
 I asked you to wait.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.800
 You went ahead anyway.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.880
 Now where's Barbara gonna sleep?

21:38.880 --> 21:41.920
 In our bed...with us.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.520
 With me

21:43.520 --> 21:47.520
 because you're gonna be sleeping
 downstairs on the sofa.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.880
 Danny...

21:53.880 --> 21:56.760
 I'm here.

21:56.760 --> 21:58.320
 The operation went very well.

21:58.320 --> 22:02.320
 I wanted to write...I was worried.

22:02.480 --> 22:05.640
 I was afraid that
 you'd get shot and die.

22:05.640 --> 22:09.640
 Danny, I'm so happy
 you're back from the war.

22:09.960 --> 22:12.240
 There's something
 that I haven't told you.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.320
 It can wait.

22:14.320 --> 22:15.040
 Rest...

22:15.040 --> 22:19.040
 After you left for
 the Pacific I learned

22:19.360 --> 22:23.360
 I was pregnant with your baby.
 Danny...

22:23.600 --> 22:27.600
 We have a son.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.760
 Morning.

22:41.760 --> 22:45.720
 Great zees last night, I was asleep
 before my head hit the pillow.

22:45.720 --> 22:48.480
 Well, have a seat,
 I'll cook breakfast.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.240
 I shouldn't keep Dr Craig
 waiting while I chow down.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.960
 Mark's already left,
 I'll drive you to the hospital.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.920
 What would you like?
 Eggs, pancakes?

22:55.920 --> 22:57.800
 Oh, uh, eggs...whatever's easy,
 do you need any help?

22:57.800 --> 23:01.800
 Oh, uh, eggs...whatever's easy,
 do you need any help?
 Sure, if you want toast
 there's bread over there.

23:02.160 --> 23:06.160
 White, whole-wheat, rye...

23:06.680 --> 23:08.960
 I hope the workers didn't wake you.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.160
 Nah, you really got a major
 facelift happening upstairs.

23:11.160 --> 23:14.760
 Nah, you really got a major
 facelift happening upstairs.
 Mark is having a nursery
 made for Barbara.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.440
 At the hospital, you know,
 Dr Craig kind of comes off...

23:18.440 --> 23:21.600
 He's really a softy, isn't he?

23:21.600 --> 23:23.520
 You've got a stain on your shirt.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.680
 Victor Ehrlich's chocolate pudding.

23:25.680 --> 23:26.960
 Wear another I'll wash that one.

23:26.960 --> 23:30.200
 No, you're going to
 way too much trouble.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.880
 Fixing me breakfast, I'd have been
 happy with OJ and the sports page.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.920
 It's no trouble at all.
 I made your lunch...

23:36.920 --> 23:39.520
 roast beef on a hard roll.

23:39.520 --> 23:42.560
 There's also an apple
 and a box of animal crackers.

23:42.560 --> 23:46.400
 They're the only cookies
 I have in the house right now.

23:46.400 --> 23:50.200
 Any requests from the market?

23:50.200 --> 23:54.200
 Any requests, Steven?

23:56.360 --> 24:00.360
 Oh...I'll butter the toast.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.040
 How long do you think
 it'll take you to catch him?

24:11.040 --> 24:12.520
 Big game hunting?

24:12.520 --> 24:13.960
 The ten tonne tabby.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.280
 He hopped onto Mr Brendle's
 breakfast tray

24:16.280 --> 24:18.880
 helped himself to three
 strips of low sodium bacon.

24:18.880 --> 24:21.480
 And for that you're
 sending Morris to death row?

24:21.480 --> 24:24.160
 Oh, I'm sure the MSPCA
 has a very humane heart,

24:24.160 --> 24:25.520
 someone will take him in.

24:25.520 --> 24:26.960
 But if they don't, excuse me.

24:26.960 --> 24:30.040
 Helen, you're the only one who
 can guarantee a stay of execution,

24:30.040 --> 24:31.280
 bring him home with you.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.120
 I already have a full house.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.760
 A terrier, two hamsters,
 four children, Richard

24:35.760 --> 24:38.320
 plus Marcie's coming home
 with her husband, Claus.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.640
 All right, if you want
 nine lives on your conscience...

24:40.640 --> 24:42.120
 Jacky, what happened?

24:42.120 --> 24:44.560
 You tell him, Elliot,
 I'm sick of explaining.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.800
 She fell asleep with her contact
 lenses on. When she woke up

24:47.800 --> 24:51.160
 the lenses stuck to her eyes
 and left abrasions on both corneas.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.200
 How long with the blindness?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.240
 Ah, three days.

24:53.240 --> 24:53.840
 At most!

24:53.840 --> 24:55.000
 All right, relax.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.800
 Go home and rest, take it from
 a guy who went through heavy R&R.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.080
 I highly recommend it.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.320
 I can't, I just took some time off
 with Robert and now Craig's on

25:02.320 --> 25:05.840
 my case. But like I said yesterday
 I am not gonna let this bug me.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.360
 Business as usual.

25:07.360 --> 25:09.400
 I'd hate to be your
 patient in surgery.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.920
 Wait... can Jacky tag
 along I've got a consult.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.600
 Sorry, I'm on my way to ER,
 she'd only be in the way.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.840
 Hey, Phil, buddy...

25:15.840 --> 25:16.880
 Not now.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.520
 Hey, what gives?

25:18.520 --> 25:19.640
 I do!

25:19.640 --> 25:22.320
 Oh no, no, hey...
 You can't saddle me. No, no...

25:22.320 --> 25:26.320
 Victor! Just take me to the doctors'
 lounge, you can dump me there.

25:26.600 --> 25:29.480
 I'm sorry. It's not like I
 don't wanna be there for you,

25:29.480 --> 25:32.240
 only I've got a post op
 with Freidman, you know...

25:32.240 --> 25:34.200
 Mrs Ryan's lens implant.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.800
 It feels like Maid Of
 The Mist around here.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.920
 What's that supposed to mean?

25:37.920 --> 25:41.360
 What's that supposed to mean?
 Your lisp, spraying
 sibilant Ss all over.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.720
 Well, thanks to bringing
 it to my attention.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.680
 I guess my sense of sound's
 been sharpened.

25:45.680 --> 25:49.520
 Every thought about
 a speech therapist...

25:49.520 --> 25:51.920
 I thought you were
 releasing Mr Tibbits?

25:51.920 --> 25:53.520
 Mmm... well we got talking...

25:53.520 --> 25:57.520
 Carol, there's no medical reason
 for him being here, discharge him.

26:13.480 --> 26:15.080
 Hi...

26:15.080 --> 26:16.640
 I've got a wheelchair.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.920
 I want you to hop in and hang on.
 I'm putting you in another room.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.640
 Where?

26:21.640 --> 26:22.800
 I'm not sure yet.

26:22.800 --> 26:26.800
 Ow! Why do I have to go
 to another room?

26:26.800 --> 26:28.680
 You ask too many questions.

26:28.680 --> 26:32.680
 I feel lousy, ow.

26:34.240 --> 26:38.240
 # The last time I saw Paris >

26:38.240 --> 26:42.240
 # Her heart was warm and gay >

26:42.400 --> 26:46.400
 # No matter how they change her

26:46.720 --> 26:50.560
 # I'll remember her that way. #

26:50.560 --> 26:51.800
 Beautiful.

26:51.800 --> 26:54.320
 Are you gonna be in on Ned Shell's
 meeting this afternoon, right?

26:54.320 --> 26:55.880
 Are you gonna be in on Ned Shell's
 meeting this afternoon, right?
 No can do.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.280
 It's only a 40 hour
 work week, my friend.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.920
 Two days ago the study had you
 worried, what changed your tune?

27:00.920 --> 27:01.960
 Two days ago the study had you
 worried, what changed your tune?
 Cole Porter.

27:01.960 --> 27:02.440
 What?

27:02.440 --> 27:05.400
 What?
 Rogers and Hart. Aaron Copeland.

27:05.400 --> 27:09.120
 I thought Maggie was
 Gone With The Wind.

27:09.120 --> 27:12.360
 I believe the lady vanishes,
 Goodbye Mr Chips

27:12.360 --> 27:15.840
 but then Don Budge wins
 the Grand Slam and so do I.

27:15.840 --> 27:19.680
 1939 Margaret Ryan has
 my baby and you have a cigar.

27:19.680 --> 27:21.760
 No, I still don't understand.

27:21.760 --> 27:24.120
 Well, I don't fully yet myself.

27:24.120 --> 27:27.160
 It all seems so fantastic

27:27.160 --> 27:31.160
 but yesterday when I saw Maggie
 my pancreas did a back flip.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.440
 My whole life's changed overnight.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.960
 What does Catherine
 think about all this?

27:34.960 --> 27:36.960
 What does Catherine
 think about all this?
 You're the only one I've told.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.240
 So mum's the word.

27:38.240 --> 27:42.240
 Remember loose lips sink ships.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.560
 Well...
 what are you doing here?

27:45.560 --> 27:48.720
 I drove Seth in.

27:48.720 --> 27:51.000
 And, also, I wanted to make

27:51.000 --> 27:55.000
 an appointment with Dr Weiss to
 start grief counselling again.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.840
 Simon's Broadway bound.

28:02.680 --> 28:06.680
 I thought I was finally over
 Stephen's death, able to get

28:06.680 --> 28:10.680
 through a whole day without feeling
 angry about what happened or sad.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
 Last month when we saw those
 old home movies of ours...

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
 I saw my baby.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.280
 Mark, why did you tear Stephen's
 room apart?

28:27.280 --> 28:30.080
 I used to be able to go in
 there and feel closer to my son.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.000
 Now you've taken that
 comfort away from me.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.560
 Inviting home surrogate sons

28:34.560 --> 28:38.560
 like Seth Griffin won't help you and
 neither will make that room a shrine.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.280
 What am I supposed to do?

28:40.280 --> 28:44.280
 When I hear someone use a
 phrase that Stephen used or

28:45.520 --> 28:48.320
 see a young man flick his
 hair back the way Stephen did.

28:48.320 --> 28:52.320
 I always bugged him
 about getting a hair cut.

28:54.040 --> 28:58.040
 It's easy for you to finish
 a chapter, Mark, but not me.

28:58.160 --> 29:02.160
 Can't you show me
 some way to get through this?

29:05.680 --> 29:08.680
 I don't have any answers.

29:08.680 --> 29:11.000
 You're gonna have to
 deal with this yourself.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
 (SIGHS)

29:22.120 --> 29:26.120
 Close the door.

29:26.760 --> 29:28.360
 Oh, it's hot in here.   Yeah.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.240
 Your patient, Mr Tibbits...

29:30.240 --> 29:31.920
 Keeping him for post
 concussion symptoms.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.160
 You mean a headache,
 Chandler filled me in.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.840
 You were gonna
 discharge Mr Tibbits,

29:35.840 --> 29:38.040
 then you put him in a ward
 and now he's in a private room.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.080
 No-one was using it.

29:40.080 --> 29:42.360
 Arthur was beaten up for no reason.

29:42.360 --> 29:45.560
 I just thought a solid day's rest
 would help him get a
 leg up on the world.

29:45.560 --> 29:47.920
 At least temporarily.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.360
 I understand your motive,
 but what you did is stupid.

29:50.360 --> 29:52.480
 Playing musical beds,
 falsifying records... come on!

29:52.480 --> 29:54.600
 Have you forgotten Ethiopia?

29:54.600 --> 29:56.240
 The Outreach programme?
 Or just given up?

29:56.240 --> 29:58.040
 Carol, do you know that the board of

29:58.040 --> 29:59.880
 trustees is ready to sell this place
 because we can't make expenses.

29:59.880 --> 30:03.880
 Now if we give a bed to every
 homeless person in Boston
 St Eligius would close immediately.

30:04.200 --> 30:08.200
 Then we'd be no use
 to anyone, would we?

30:11.520 --> 30:13.360
 Mr Tibbits...

30:13.360 --> 30:16.040
 Put him back on the streets tonight?

30:16.040 --> 30:17.080
 Tomorrow...

30:17.080 --> 30:21.080
 Big of you.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.600
 This is a pain.

30:28.600 --> 30:32.440
 When I was a kid I had amblyopia.
 Lazy eye?

30:32.440 --> 30:34.200
 My doctor made me wear a patch.

30:34.200 --> 30:38.200
 The grief that we got,
 well the kids at school, well...

30:39.080 --> 30:43.080
 One day I cried so hard that the
 tears made the patch come off.

30:43.480 --> 30:44.960
 What's all the noise?

30:44.960 --> 30:47.040
 Adding another radiology suite.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.320
 There's not
 enough money to run this place,

30:49.320 --> 30:51.360
 but the city goes on construction.

30:51.360 --> 30:54.640
 Typical bonehead management!

30:54.640 --> 30:58.640
 Hey! Watch what you're doing.

31:04.920 --> 31:08.920
 Jack...

31:10.680 --> 31:13.560
 Jack...

31:13.560 --> 31:15.560
 Jack?

31:15.560 --> 31:17.240
 Chandler!

31:17.240 --> 31:19.080
 What you did stinks!

31:19.080 --> 31:20.760
 Well you didn't deal
 straight with me.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.120
 Where do you get off
 being so self righteous?

31:22.120 --> 31:23.800
 And chalking Mr Tibbits

31:23.800 --> 31:25.840
 up on the hospital tab,
 you figure that's a big achievement?

31:25.840 --> 31:28.000
 Think about someone
 besides yourself.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.880
 You're not the
 only sensitive one around here.

31:29.880 --> 31:33.240
 You see I've worked abortion
 clinics, I've answered suicide

31:33.240 --> 31:37.240
 hotlines, so don't tell me I
 don't care.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.840
 So how are you feeling?

31:48.840 --> 31:51.920
 This was supposed to be an
 outpatient operation.

31:51.920 --> 31:55.920
 I'm glad you had to stick around.

31:56.040 --> 31:57.840
 What's that about?

31:57.840 --> 32:01.080
 Ever since you told me about our son,

32:01.080 --> 32:05.080
 I've been bursting, wanting to shout
 the news out to the world.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.200
 That damned anaesthesia!

32:12.200 --> 32:15.640
 I usually only
 dream that I tell you.

32:15.640 --> 32:18.040
 I'm very sorry that
 you've found out.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.120
 Why?

32:21.120 --> 32:23.280
 Where is our son, tell me about him?

32:23.280 --> 32:26.800
 Except for one specific act, you
 had nothing to do with that child.

32:26.800 --> 32:30.240
 That's unfair. I didn't even know
 you were pregnant when you left.

32:30.240 --> 32:33.000
 We should have gotten married
 and raised him together.

32:33.000 --> 32:34.200
 You know that was impossible.

32:34.200 --> 32:38.200
 Because you were a coward. So what
 if we came from different religions!

32:38.440 --> 32:41.200
 You should have had the
 guts to go to our parents

32:41.200 --> 32:42.880
 and the rabbi and the priest
 and tell them to go to hell!

32:42.880 --> 32:44.840
 Times were different then.

32:44.840 --> 32:48.640
 Yes, but seven years later,
 things had changed so radically that

32:48.640 --> 32:51.200
 you married a Catholic anyway. Bull!

32:51.200 --> 32:53.400
 Like we used to be... fighting.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.960
 Yes... we fought...

32:55.960 --> 32:59.280
 because we had nothing in common.

32:59.280 --> 33:03.280
 You said
 that I was going to be your wife.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.960
 I wanted that desperately

33:06.960 --> 33:10.200
 and then you just walked away
 and left me

33:10.200 --> 33:14.200
 to marry and divorce Freddie.
 (LAUGHS BITTERLY)

33:17.080 --> 33:19.120
 I'm alone now.

33:19.120 --> 33:22.880
 It's over 40 years
 since we separated.

33:22.880 --> 33:26.880
 You've made choices on your own,
 accept responsibility.

33:27.160 --> 33:31.160
 That doesn't make
 living with my decisions any easier.

33:32.080 --> 33:36.080
 The fact that I had to place
 my only child up for adoption.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.120
 You gave away my son?

33:40.120 --> 33:43.760
 I couldn't raise him by myself.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.080
 I didn't have the means

33:46.080 --> 33:48.520
 and I didn't have the strength.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.840
 Go on home,

33:50.840 --> 33:54.400
 go home to Catherine...
 your children, your grandchildren.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.760
 I don't want you here.

33:56.760 --> 34:00.760
 You're the reason that
 my life's a mess.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.520
 No, 4.30 is no good for the mayor.

34:14.520 --> 34:18.280
 No, 2.30 is the dentist.

34:18.280 --> 34:22.280
 Alan...
 Alan, look, I'm going to run.

34:22.480 --> 34:23.120
 Hey, Ned.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.679
 Donald, how's tricks? I hope
 you don't mind me using the phone.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.960
 No, not at all.
 Sorry I'm late. Have a seat.

34:27.960 --> 34:31.040
 Look, I'm running behind schedule,
 so I have to cut our meeting short.

34:31.040 --> 34:35.040
 Here's the deal. The city has
 decided to sell St Eligius.

34:35.360 --> 34:37.639
 No discussion?
 They do a feasibility study

34:37.639 --> 34:39.639
 and then all of a sudden, just like
 that, we're on the auction block?

34:39.639 --> 34:41.800
 The mayor's office might turn this
 place in the housing for the elderly.

34:41.800 --> 34:44.880
 Well, I'm all for low-rent housing.

34:44.880 --> 34:45.880
 I didn't say anything about low rent.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.920
 Well, what influenced
 their decision?

34:47.920 --> 34:51.400
 Everything. Especially your
 emergency room,

34:51.400 --> 34:54.199
 a black hole sucking money out
 faster than we can pour it in.

34:54.199 --> 34:57.400
 I mean, keeping this hospital
 open, it's just bad business.

34:57.400 --> 35:00.040
 A hospital isn't a business, Ned.
 Were a vital part of this community.

35:00.040 --> 35:01.840
 Donald, I can appreciate the function

35:01.840 --> 35:04.080
 served by St Eligius.
 But the well has run dry.

35:04.080 --> 35:06.960
 Ned, do me a favour.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.960
 Stall this thing. Give me a chance
 to talk to Daniel and the board.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.640
 There's no point.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.960
 There's a proposal I want to offer
 the mayor, and it will show

35:12.960 --> 35:14.520
 that we can cut this deficit.

35:14.520 --> 35:17.120
 Especially in the ER.

35:17.120 --> 35:18.240
 You have numbers?

35:18.240 --> 35:20.040
 It is a study we're doing
 on our own. We just need a

35:20.040 --> 35:23.320
 few days to finish it, a week, tops.

35:23.320 --> 35:27.320
 One week.   You got it.

35:30.680 --> 35:34.680
 How the hell am I
 going to pull this off?

36:09.360 --> 36:13.360
 Oh, Stephen...

36:22.320 --> 36:25.280
 Going down to the low thirties.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.000
 Yeah, it's been a beautiful
 Indian summer,

36:28.000 --> 36:30.640
 but the fall's come on strong.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.480
 It's not right, you having
 to live on the streets.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.880
 Oh, I'll be OK. The past

36:35.880 --> 36:39.880
 couple of days, I been resting,
 and I know what my body can take.

36:40.080 --> 36:44.080
 I feel strong, and you know,
 my life is like playing chess.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.400
 You use some strategy and

36:47.400 --> 36:51.400
 anticipate the moves, and always
 try to be sure I'm one jump ahead.

36:53.240 --> 36:57.240
 Sheer will and determination.

36:58.680 --> 37:02.680
 Er...

37:04.040 --> 37:07.560
 I want to give you this money.
 It's only $100, but...

37:07.560 --> 37:09.920
 But it feels like two tens.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.680
 But you know, sweetheart, you
 really don't have to do this.

37:12.680 --> 37:15.200
 No, it makes me feel better.

37:15.200 --> 37:19.040
 Well, OK, thank you so much.

37:19.040 --> 37:22.680
 Now, you be careful, and if you ever
 need anyone to
 whip you at chess again...

37:22.680 --> 37:26.680
 Right!

37:35.240 --> 37:39.240
 Good night.

37:40.440 --> 37:43.280
  MIAOWING

37:43.280 --> 37:47.280
 Kitty! Hey, what are you doing?

37:47.400 --> 37:51.400
 Come on. Oh, come here.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.960
 Ah, finally caught
 the little bum, huh?

37:54.960 --> 37:58.640
 Yep. Some days you get the cat,
 some days the cat gets you.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.360
  LIFT PINGS

38:01.360 --> 38:04.760
 You'd better stay away
 from Mike and Teddy.

38:04.760 --> 38:08.760
 Geoffrey's hamsters.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.840
 Hello, dear.

38:15.840 --> 38:19.000
 Would you prefer to drive?

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
 We've been married 40 years,
 so it's crazy Margaret Ryan

38:23.080 --> 38:26.520
 should cause me to
 question your contentment.

38:26.520 --> 38:28.840
 I would not leave you.

38:28.840 --> 38:32.720
 Well, of course not,
 not in the sense that you'd leave me
 for someone else, anyway.

38:32.720 --> 38:36.160
 But one day, I will lose you.

38:36.160 --> 38:39.480
 And my biggest fear is that
 your years with me

38:39.480 --> 38:42.720
 will have been a compromise.

38:42.720 --> 38:43.240
 Oh, no.

38:43.240 --> 38:46.280
 Margaret is an
 intelligent, vital woman.

38:46.280 --> 38:50.120
 She broadened your horizons,
 challenged your intellect.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.040
 My worry is that

38:52.040 --> 38:54.640
 I haven't been able to do that.

38:54.640 --> 38:58.400
 You have enriched my life
 far beyond anything I deserve.

38:58.400 --> 39:02.400
 There is no one I admire more,
 try to measure myself against.

39:03.720 --> 39:07.720
 When I'm with you, I know
 I am still very much alive.

39:08.040 --> 39:12.040
 Daniel, there is something that
 I need to know.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.920
 Have you ever been unfaithful to me?

39:14.920 --> 39:17.440
 Never.

39:17.440 --> 39:21.440
 I love you, Catherine.

39:27.640 --> 39:29.440
 You drive.

39:29.440 --> 39:33.440
 That way we'll get home faster.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.480
 Shall I put this one on first?

39:36.480 --> 39:40.480
 You want this one?
 Hi. Come on in here with us.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.080
 And here's the green one.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.000
 How did Moser do, redecorating?

39:45.000 --> 39:47.480
 We haven't looked at the room yet.
 We've been waiting for you.

39:47.480 --> 39:50.320
 Where did that come from?

39:50.320 --> 39:54.320
 I found that in one
 of Stephen's boxes.

39:54.440 --> 39:57.440
 You know, Mark,
 when I saw that sweatshirt,

39:57.440 --> 39:59.720
 it was as though
 Stephen left it behind just

39:59.720 --> 40:02.800
 for me to find to give to Barbara.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.800
 We can't replace our son, ever.
 We shouldn't even try.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.560
 Come on, Barbara.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.280
 Let's go look at the new room.

40:09.280 --> 40:13.280
 OK?

40:20.800 --> 40:24.800
 Oh, Mark.

40:41.640 --> 40:45.080
 Barbara's room is beautiful, Mark.

40:45.080 --> 40:49.080
  PIANO PLAYS

41:30.840 --> 41:34.840
 That was beautiful.
 I used to go to this club,

41:35.200 --> 41:38.080
 125th Street in Harlem, and listen to
 Eight Fingers Brown.

41:38.080 --> 41:40.160
 I've heard of him.

41:40.160 --> 41:42.360
 He was missing a thumb and pinkie?

41:42.360 --> 41:46.360
 What he could do with those eight
 on the 88, oh...

41:48.600 --> 41:51.720
 Back in those days,
 everything was new.

41:51.720 --> 41:54.520
 You would have thought that
 the world never existed until

41:54.520 --> 41:56.120
 we got our hands on it.

41:56.120 --> 42:00.120
 And back then, I made a decision

42:01.760 --> 42:05.760
 that seemed so clear, so...

42:07.760 --> 42:11.760
 Oh, if only I could
 turn back the clock.

42:12.560 --> 42:15.640
 I'd do things very differently.

42:15.640 --> 42:17.440
 Yeah, but you know
 hindsight is 20-20.

42:17.440 --> 42:21.440
 And once you've made a mistake,
 it can't be undone.

42:21.480 --> 42:25.480
 It don't have to be that way. If you
 realise you've made a mistake, it
 gives you freedom to make amends.

42:26.560 --> 42:30.560
 But what I did was unforgivable.

42:30.840 --> 42:34.480
 Well, a piano turns sour, you

42:34.480 --> 42:38.480
 get out a tune, it don't sound right
 until somebody tightens the strings.

42:39.240 --> 42:43.160
 And nothing you've done can
 ever be fixed unless you try.

42:43.160 --> 42:47.160
 All I want is to see him again.

42:48.280 --> 42:52.280
 But, Arthur...

42:53.160 --> 42:54.560
 I abandoned him.

42:54.560 --> 42:58.560
 So even if I knew where to search,
 he might not speak to me.

43:01.080 --> 43:02.480
 Maybe.

43:02.480 --> 43:05.200
 I got a buddy, the Kluke.

43:05.200 --> 43:09.200
 I keep waiting for him to come back
 one day, and maybe he never will.

43:10.640 --> 43:14.640
 But in my heart, I know he's trying,
 and that's what keeps me going.

43:17.680 --> 43:21.680
 It sure feels like a full moon.

43:21.920 --> 43:25.920
 My baby had his father's eyes.

43:28.960 --> 43:31.960
 As soon as I feel better,

43:31.960 --> 43:33.760
 I'm going to start looking.

43:33.760 --> 43:37.760
  PIANO MUSIC

43:41.120 --> 43:45.120
 # If the sky above you

43:47.880 --> 43:51.880
 # Grows dark and full of clouds

43:53.320 --> 43:57.320
 # And that old north wind

43:58.440 --> 44:02.440
 # Begins to blow

44:11.480 --> 44:15.480
 # And call my name out loud

44:18.360 --> 44:22.360
 # And soon I'll be knocking at
 your door

44:26.080 --> 44:30.080
 # Your door

44:30.520 --> 44:34.520
 # You just call out my name

44:37.400 --> 44:41.400
 # And you know wherever I am

44:41.720 --> 44:45.720
 # I'll come running

44:48.360 --> 44:52.360
 # To see you again

44:59.520 --> 45:03.520
 # Winter, summer or fall

45:04.240 --> 45:08.240
 # All you must do is call

45:08.720 --> 45:12.720
 # I'll come running. #
