03:03.100 --> 03:07.311
This is what I get in return
for 30 years of service for my company?

03:07.604 --> 03:10.273
And they send some yo-yo 
like you in here

03:10.357 --> 03:12.817
to try to tell me that I'm out of a job?

03:12.901 --> 03:14.986
They should be telling you
you're out of a job.

03:15.070 --> 03:19.198
You have a lot of gall coming in here
and firing your number one producer.

03:19.283 --> 03:20.408
And then you're going
to go home tomorrow

03:20.492 --> 03:22.410
and make more money
than you've ever made in your life,

03:22.494 --> 03:24.662
and I'm going to go home
without a pay check. Fuck you.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.998
I just...
I guess you leave me dumbfounded.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.041
I don't know where this is coming from.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.710
How am I supposed to go back as a man

03:30.794 --> 03:33.004
and explain this to my wife
that I lost my job?

03:33.422 --> 03:35.131
On a stress level,

03:35.215 --> 03:39.135
I've heard that losing your job
is like a death in the family.

03:40.053 --> 03:43.055
But personally, I feel more like

03:44.308 --> 03:48.811
the people I worked with 
were my family and I died.

03:48.937 --> 03:53.399
I can't afford to be unemployed.
I have a house payment. I have children.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.402
I don't know how you can live
with yourself,

03:56.486 --> 03:59.822
but I'm sure that you'll find a way
while the rest of us are suffering.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.991
Who the fuck are you, man?

04:03.118 --> 04:05.745
<i>Excellent question. 
Who the fuck am I?</i>

04:06.330 --> 04:08.539
<i>Poor Steve has worked here
for seven years.</i>

04:08.832 --> 04:13.002
<i>He's never had a meeting with me
before or passed me in the hall</i>

04:13.086 --> 04:15.087
<i>or told me a story in the break room.</i>

04:15.172 --> 04:16.714
<i>And that's because I don't work here.</i>

04:16.798 --> 04:20.176
<i>I work for another company that lends me out 
to pussies like Steve's boss</i>

04:20.260 --> 04:22.637
<i>who don't have the balls
to sack their own employees,</i>

04:22.721 --> 04:24.513
<i>and in some cases, for good reason.</i>

04:24.598 --> 04:27.892
<i>Because people do crazy shit
when they get fired.</i>

04:32.481 --> 04:34.440
Did I do something wrong?

04:34.524 --> 04:36.692
I mean, is there something
I could do differently here?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.111
This is not an assessment
of your productivity.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.781
You gotta try not to take this personally.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.950
"Don't take it personally."

04:44.034 --> 04:46.953
Steven, I want you to review this packet.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.790
Take it seriously. I think you're gonna find 
a lot of good answers in here.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.501
I'm sure this is gonna be 
very helpful, a packet.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.753
Thank you. A packet.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.426
Well, anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world

05:02.511 --> 05:04.804
sat where you are right now.

05:04.888 --> 05:08.224
And it's because they sat there
they were able to do it.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.059
That's the truth.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.567
I'm gonna need your keycard.

05:20.904 --> 05:22.196
Great. Okay.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.574
Now, I want you to take the day,
go get together your personal things,

05:25.659 --> 05:28.995
and then tomorrow,
you get yourself some exercise.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.496
You go out for a jog,

05:30.580 --> 05:34.750
you give yourself some routines,
and pretty soon you find your legs.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.711
How do I get in touch with you?

05:36.962 --> 05:38.838
Don't worry,
we'll be in touch with you soon.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.090
This is just the beginning.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.343
<i>I'll never see Steve again.</i>

06:02.529 --> 06:03.654
Thank you.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.865
<i>To know me is to fly with me.</i>

06:05.949 --> 06:07.950
<i>This is where I live.</i>

06:11.079 --> 06:14.081
<i>When I run my card, the system 
automatically prompts the desk clerk</i>

06:14.166 --> 06:16.250
<i>to greet me with this exact statement.</i> 

06:17.044 --> 06:18.878
Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.296
<i>It's these kinds of systemized,</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:23.382
<i>friendly touches
that keep my world in orbit.</i>

06:58.668 --> 07:00.961
<i>All the things you probably hate 
about traveling,</i>

07:01.046 --> 07:05.091
<i>the recycled air, the artificial lighting,
the digital juice dispensers,</i>

07:05.175 --> 07:08.803
<i>the cheap sushi,
are warm reminders that I'm home.</i>

07:22.526 --> 07:24.527
Do you want the cancer?

07:26.988 --> 07:29.323
- The what?
- Do you want the cancer?

07:29.407 --> 07:30.991
The cancer?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.285
The can, sir?

07:33.703 --> 07:36.205
No. I'm fine, thank you.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.855
How much does your life weigh?

08:02.732 --> 08:05.609
Imagine for a second
that you're carrying a backpack.

08:05.694 --> 08:08.362
I want you to feel the straps
on your shoulders.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.364
Feel them?

08:11.199 --> 08:14.493
Now I want you to pack it with all 
the stuff that you have in your life.

08:14.578 --> 08:18.164
You start with the little things,
the things on shelves and in drawers,

08:18.248 --> 08:20.875
the knickknacks, the collectibles.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.502
Feel the weight as that adds up.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.379
Then you start adding larger stuff,

08:25.463 --> 08:29.592
clothes, tabletop appliances,
lamps, linens,

08:30.093 --> 08:31.677
your TV.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.846
The backpack should be
getting pretty heavy now.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.556
And you go bigger.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.684
Your couch, bed, your kitchen table.
Stuff it all in there.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.854
Your car, get it in there.

08:42.188 --> 08:46.692
Your home, whether it's a studio apartment 
or a two-bedroom house,

08:46.776 --> 08:49.862
I want you to stuff it all
into that backpack.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.574
Now try to walk.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.453
It's kind of hard, isn't it?

08:58.205 --> 09:00.164
This is what we do to ourselves
on a daily basis.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.042
We weigh ourselves down
until we can't even move.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.462
And make no mistake, moving is living.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.840
Now, I'm gonna set that backpack on fire.

09:09.925 --> 09:12.801
What do you want to take out of it?
Photos?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.054
Photos are for people
who can't remember.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.848
Drink some ginkgo
and let the photos burn.

09:18.266 --> 09:23.812
In fact, let everything burn and imagine
waking up tomorrow with nothing.

09:25.774 --> 09:28.400
It's kind of exhilarating, isn't it?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.368
Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.254
Ryan Bingham's office.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.589
You put me in a Dodge Stratus
in Kansas City.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.633
They were completely out 
of all full-size sedans.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.801
- Did you try...
- <i>Yes.</i>

09:53.885 --> 09:55.594
<i>I reminded them of your remarkable</i>

09:55.679 --> 09:57.721
No.1 Gold Club status
and years in the program.

09:57.806 --> 10:01.016
They are literally moving mountains
to see you in a Sebring.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.269
Fair enough. 
Any other messages?

10:03.353 --> 10:04.478
<i>Your sister Kara called.</i>

10:04.562 --> 10:06.939
Needs to speak urgently
about your sister's wedding.

10:07.023 --> 10:10.317
I told her you were mid-air 
and not even I knew your final destination.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.152
- Well done.
- <i>And you got an invitation</i>

10:12.237 --> 10:14.238
to speak at Goalquest in Vegas.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.032
Goalquest 20?

10:17.284 --> 10:20.703
<i>Every once in a while, I do speaking engagements, 
motivational kind of stuff.</i>

10:20.787 --> 10:24.415
<i>But Goalquest?
We're talking major Tony Robbins shit.</i>

10:24.708 --> 10:26.542
It's got a hologram on it.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.253
They're calling it Dos Equis.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.421
All right, I'll check in.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.173
- Hold on. I've got Craig Gregory for you.
- Wait...

10:33.258 --> 10:34.383
Fuck.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.261
How is my little road warrior?

10:37.345 --> 10:40.472
Hey, 20 minutes from boarding
into a world of bliss.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.725
Real good numbers out of Phoenix,
Ry guy.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.643
Hey, you know that Big Auto
is about to cut

10:44.728 --> 10:46.353
another 10K 
before the end of the month?

10:46.479 --> 10:48.147
- No kidding.
- Yeah. Christmas came early.

10:48.231 --> 10:49.940
I wish I could have you
in about five places at once,

10:50.025 --> 10:51.859
but I do need you back here in Omaha
by the end of week.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.694
- All right?
- I thought you needed me everywhere.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.989
Well, you know, we got something
real big here, a real game changer.

10:57.073 --> 10:58.324
What are we talking about here?

10:58.408 --> 11:04.121
You'll see. Today I took my first crap
in two weeks, hallelujah.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.749
- That's me hanging up on you.
- Great, love that sound.

11:27.062 --> 11:29.104
Are you satisfied with Maestro?

11:32.442 --> 11:33.942
Yeah, I am.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.987
A little stingy with their miles.
I like Hertz.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.239
No, Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.

11:39.324 --> 11:42.159
If a car has over 20,000 miles,
I won't drive it.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.413
Maestro doesn't instant checkout.
I like to park and go.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.290
Hertz doesn't guarantee navigation.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.542
It's funny. You don't seem like a girl
who needs directions.

11:50.627 --> 11:54.630
I hate asking for directions.
That's why I get a nav.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.593
That new outfit, Colonial, isn't bad.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.347
- Is that a joke?
- Yes.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.892
- Because their kiosk placement blows.
- They never have available upgrades.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.727
Basically, it's a fleet of shit-boxes.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.230
I don't know 
how they're still in business.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.399
- I'm Ryan.
- I'm Alex.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.655
Maplewood card.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.241
How dare you bring that
into this palace?

12:22.325 --> 12:23.951
Hilton offers equal value and better food,

12:24.035 --> 12:26.245
but the Maplewood gives out
warm cookies at check-in.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.538
They got you with the cookies, did they?

12:27.622 --> 12:29.706
Yeah. I'm a sucker 
for simulated hospitality.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.417
You know,
there's an industry term for that.

12:31.501 --> 12:35.003
It's a mixture of "faux" and "homey." 
"Faumey."

12:36.297 --> 12:37.673
Oh, my God.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.259
I wasn't sure this actually existed.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.261
This is the American Airlines...

12:42.345 --> 12:44.596
It's a Concierge Key, yeah.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.437
- What is that, carbon fiber?
- Graphite.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.938
Oh, God, I love the weight.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.107
I was pretty excited the day
that bad boy came in.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.942
Yeah. I'll say.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.236
I put up pretty pedestrian numbers.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.530
Sixty thou a year, domestic.

13:02.157 --> 13:04.450
- That's not bad.
- Don't patronize me.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.285
- What's your total?
- It's a personal question.

13:06.369 --> 13:07.953
- Oh, please.
- And we hardly know each other.

13:08.037 --> 13:11.540
Come on. Show some hubris.
Come on, impress me.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.711
- I bet it's huge.
- You have no idea.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.546
How big?

13:17.714 --> 13:19.673
What is it, this big?

13:20.216 --> 13:22.134
- This big?
- I don't want to brag.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.178
Come on! Come on.

13:24.679 --> 13:28.515
Let's just say I have a number in mind.
I haven't hit it yet.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.395
This is pretty fucking sexy.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.023
Hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.734
We're two people who get turned on
by elite status.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.111
I think cheap is our starting point.

13:41.196 --> 13:43.405
There's nothing cheap about loyalty.

13:47.035 --> 13:50.871
So, we came up with this master plan,
which was for me

13:51.664 --> 13:56.126
to put gauze,
to put bandages on both my hands.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.545
Then we got on the plane,

13:58.630 --> 14:02.007
transatlantic, flying to Zürich.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.301
Walked up... 
Waited till it was dark,

14:04.385 --> 14:06.887
and walked up to the bathroom with her.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.640
Everybody was watching the movie,
and I was like...

14:09.724 --> 14:11.433
Opened up, went inside.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.060
She opened the door for me,

14:13.144 --> 14:14.978
and came in
like she was gonna help me.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.356
And then, you know, we gave it
our best shot. It wasn't great.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.233
But it was fun. 
It was tricky.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.527
- Give me some details.
- Well, it's not so easy.

14:21.611 --> 14:24.404
- Have you ever tried it? It's not so easy.
- Yes, I have.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.075
- Really?
- Really.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.874
- You've done that?
- I have done that.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.085
On a transatlantic flight?

14:38.169 --> 14:41.088
On a domestic flight. 
Regional, actually.

14:41.172 --> 14:42.965
- Like nighttime?
- No, like daytime.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.925
- You...
- What?

14:45.301 --> 14:46.426
I mean, how do you do that?

14:46.511 --> 14:48.512
I'm really flexible.

14:52.684 --> 14:53.976
Look.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.359
I should throw these out.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.574
We can always use that room
with the ice machine.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.033
Here, look.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.677
Good call on that towel rack.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.138
I like how you burritoed me
in the sofa cushions.

15:31.222 --> 15:32.973
I was improvising.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.101
Shame we didn't make it to the closet.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.187
- We got to do this again.
- Yeah.

15:44.569 --> 15:48.363
All right, I'm in Newark on the 12th,
Modesto on the 13th,

15:49.073 --> 15:51.033
Oklahoma City on the 15th.

15:51.117 --> 15:54.453
Any Southwest? I'll be swinging 
by Albuquerque week of the 16th.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.330
No, but I'll be in Florida on the 20th.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.457
- Fort Lauderdale?
- Miami.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.542
- That's nothing.
- Forty minutes.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.473
I should probably go back to my room
so I can wake up in my bed.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.017
I think that would be
the ladylike thing to do.

16:25.068 --> 16:26.735
Nice meeting you.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.570
A pleasure.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.148
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Ryan, how you holding up?</i>  

17:06.233 --> 17:09.944
<i>Every family has the one person
who keeps the genealogy in check.</i>

17:10.029 --> 17:12.196
<i>That's my sister Kara, the glue.</i>

17:12.573 --> 17:14.782
Fine. You and the kids?

17:15.367 --> 17:18.954
Missy's outstanding, Matthew made varsity. 
How's the road?

17:19.038 --> 17:21.665
- Couldn't be better.
- <i>Good. So, Ryan?</i>

17:22.750 --> 17:23.709
Yeah?

17:23.792 --> 17:25.210
<i>I didn't even want to have 
to ask you this</i>

17:25.294 --> 17:28.463
because I know how you are
about doing things for others,

17:28.548 --> 17:31.174
<i>but we're coming up on three weeks
to go to Julie's wedding</i>

17:31.259 --> 17:33.218
and there's something
we could really use your help on.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.344
Yeah?

17:34.429 --> 17:36.096
<i>We've been sending people these kits</i>

17:36.180 --> 17:38.765
so they can print out photos
of Julie and Jim on cardboard 

17:38.850 --> 17:41.351
and then take photos of them
in interesting places,

17:41.436 --> 17:43.145
kind of like that gnome
in the French movie.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.271
Why?

17:44.939 --> 17:47.399
Because it's Julie's wedding
and she thinks it would be fun.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.985
- Does it matter why?
- How is Julie?

17:50.194 --> 17:51.987
<i>Would you call her?
She thinks you've turned to butter.</i>

17:52.071 --> 17:54.239
You're awfully isolated the way you live.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.116
Isolated? I'm surrounded.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.702
<i>So, your assistant said
you were gonna be in Vegas.</i>

17:58.786 --> 17:59.786
Did he?

17:59.871 --> 18:03.749
Can you get a photo of the cutout
in front of the Luxor pyramid?

18:03.833 --> 18:05.834
The place is a shithole.
Nobody stays there.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.712
Jesus, Ryan,
I'm not asking you to check in.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.922
Can you just take a stupid photo?

18:11.549 --> 18:13.258
I'll try my best.

18:13.634 --> 18:16.011
<i>Thank you for trying your best.</i>

18:34.906 --> 18:38.200
<i>Last year, 
I spent 322 days on the road,</i>

18:38.284 --> 18:41.745
<i>which means I had to spend
43 miserable days at home.</i>

19:06.187 --> 19:07.813
Hey, neighbor.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.481
Hey. Hi!

19:10.233 --> 19:12.734
Hi. Hey, I signed for this
while you were gone.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.402
Thanks.

19:15.655 --> 19:17.906
- I hope it wasn't too much of a bother.
- Nah.

19:22.787 --> 19:23.912
Wow.

19:24.080 --> 19:28.083
Yeah, it's my sister. I haven't met
the guy yet. They're getting married.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.585
- Lots of luck.
- I know, right?

19:31.087 --> 19:34.130
What are you doing tonight?
You wanna come over later?

19:36.926 --> 19:38.760
I've started seeing somebody.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.429
Okay. Great.

19:43.266 --> 19:44.975
Hey, it's good to see you.

19:45.810 --> 19:49.229
- You, too.
- It seems like it's been a while this time.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.870
Okay.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.541
I am just... I'm thrilled that
everyone's back under one roof.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.792
Welcome home, boys.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.169
I know there's been a lot of whispering
about why we're here,

20:13.254 --> 20:17.591
so let me jump right in.
Retailers are down 20%.

20:17.675 --> 20:20.093
Auto industry is in the dump.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.512
Housing market doesn't have a heartbeat.

20:22.597 --> 20:25.891
It is one of the worst times 
on record for America.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.477
This is our moment.

20:30.938 --> 20:34.065
Now, last summer, we received
a dynamite young woman here

20:34.150 --> 20:35.901
from Cornell,

20:35.985 --> 20:39.404
and she had some pretty big ideas
that she challenged me with.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.032
And my first reaction was,
"Who does this kid think that she is?"

20:42.116 --> 20:44.409
But after I gave it a listen,
she really knocked me out.

20:44.493 --> 20:48.330
So, with a peek into our future,
Natalie Keener.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.753
If there's one word I want to
leave you with today, it's this.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.049
"Glocal"?

21:00.593 --> 21:01.885
Glocal.

21:02.303 --> 21:05.180
Our global must become local.

21:06.474 --> 21:11.227
This company keeps 23 people
on the road at least 250 days a year.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.522
It's expensive, and it's inefficient.

21:14.899 --> 21:17.776
When I came to Craig
three months ago with this,

21:17.860 --> 21:22.447
he told me, and quite astutely,
it's only a problem if you have a solution.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.617
Well, today I stand before you
with just that.

21:27.203 --> 21:30.914
You all know Ned in reception.
Today I'm gonna fire Ned.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.460
Sorry, Ned. I'm sure HR
will hire you back this afternoon.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.337
We'll see about that.

21:38.047 --> 21:42.258
Now Ned could be any employee in any one 
of our clients' locations worldwide.

21:42.343 --> 21:44.469
Strategy packets 
will be shipped in advance.

21:44.553 --> 21:45.553
Ned would be given a seat

21:45.638 --> 21:48.556
and find one of our transition specialists
waiting for him.

21:49.684 --> 21:52.560
Mr. Laskin, the reason
we're having this conversation

21:52.645 --> 21:54.729
is your position is no longer available.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.065
<i>I don't understand. 
I'm fired?</i>

21:57.149 --> 21:59.484
Hearing the words "you've been let go"
is never easy.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.987
Change is always scary,
but consider the following.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.322
Anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world

22:04.407 --> 22:05.490
sat where you are now.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.576
And it's because they sat there
that they were able to do it.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.328
That's my fucking line.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.288
<i>But what happens now?</i>

22:12.373 --> 22:13.832
This is the first step of a process

22:13.916 --> 22:16.042
that will end with you in a new job
that fulfills you.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.961
<i>Yeah. But how does it work?</i>

22:18.045 --> 22:19.879
I want you to take the packet
in front of you.

22:19.964 --> 22:23.174
Review it. All the answers
you're looking for are inside.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.884
Start filling out
the necessary information,

22:24.969 --> 22:27.679
and before you know it, you'll be
on your way to new opportunities.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.015
Now, Ned, I need you 
to go back to your desk

22:30.099 --> 22:31.766
and start putting together your things.

22:31.851 --> 22:35.562
As a favor to me, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't spread the news just yet.

22:35.646 --> 22:37.355
Panic doesn't help anyone.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.524
<i>I understand.</i>

22:40.609 --> 22:42.444
Give it up for Ned.

22:46.699 --> 22:50.201
You can start the morning in Boston,
stop in Dallas over lunch,

22:50.286 --> 22:52.120
and finish the day in San Francisco,

22:52.621 --> 22:54.289
all for the price of a T1 line.

22:54.832 --> 22:58.126
Our inflated travel budget
is eviscerated by 85%.

22:58.419 --> 23:01.546
And more importantly
to you guys on the road,

23:01.630 --> 23:03.923
no more Christmases
in a hotel in Tulsa,

23:04.008 --> 23:06.301
no more hours lost to weather delays.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.386
You get to come home.

23:11.682 --> 23:13.308
Tell me you're not taking this seriously.

23:14.018 --> 23:16.144
That's why I brought 
the entire company in from the road,

23:16.228 --> 23:17.729
because we're not taking it seriously.

23:17.813 --> 23:20.857
There is a methodology to what I do.
There is a reason why it works.

23:20.941 --> 23:22.901
Coke and IBM have been doing this
for years, all right.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.569
Are you familiar with them?

23:24.653 --> 23:25.737
Now just like anything else, you know,

23:25.821 --> 23:27.405
it's gonna take a few months
of sort of transition

23:27.490 --> 23:29.574
and then everybody is gonna settle in.

23:29.658 --> 23:30.867
Who are you taking off the road?

23:30.951 --> 23:33.203
How are you not getting this?
You're grounded.

23:33.287 --> 23:35.580
Everybody's grounded. 
It's done.

23:35.664 --> 23:39.167
What we do here is brutal,
and it does leave people devastated.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.920
But there is a dignity to the way I do it.

23:42.004 --> 23:45.256
By stabbing them in the chest
instead of the back, is that right?

23:45.341 --> 23:47.133
- You wanted to see me?
- Well...

23:47.218 --> 23:48.843
Yeah. You know what?
Yeah, come on in.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.678
- Come on in here.
- Great job out there, Natalie.

23:50.763 --> 23:54.057
- Thank you. How's everyone taking it?
- Great.

23:54.517 --> 23:57.936
Listen, I admire your... 
Your zeal.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.604
And I think you have 
some very good ideas.

23:59.688 --> 24:03.441
But you know nothing
about the realities of my industry.

24:03.526 --> 24:06.986
You can set up an iChat,
but you don't know how people think.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.531
- Actually, I minored in psychology.
- Nice.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.452
- Okay, kiddo, fire me.
- Ryan.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.287
Well, since she's gonna be doing this
on a regular basis,

24:16.372 --> 24:17.831
don't you wanna know if
she can fire somebody?

24:17.915 --> 24:20.583
- She's fired Ned.
- My dog can fire Ned. Fire me.

24:20.668 --> 24:24.212
- You don't need to do this.
- No, it's okay. I got this.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.799
Mr. Bingham, I regret to inform you

24:27.883 --> 24:31.344
that your position at this company
is no longer available.

24:31.428 --> 24:33.346
- Who the hell are you?
- My name is Miss Keener.

24:33.430 --> 24:35.765
- I'm here today to discuss your future.
- My future?

24:35.850 --> 24:37.433
The only one who can fire me
is Craig Gregory.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.102
Mr. Gregory hired me
to handle this for him.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.812
Handle what? Handle me?

24:40.896 --> 24:43.481
Mr. Gregory hired me,
he's the only one who can fire me.

24:43.566 --> 24:45.608
You know what?
I'm gonna go talk to him.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.027
- Mr. Bingham.
- No, no, no. You can't follow me.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.487
You're on a computer screen, remember?

24:49.572 --> 24:51.156
- Ryan.
- All right. Let's try this again.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.615
- Fire me again.
- I just did.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.325
Actually, you didn't. 
Fire me.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.827
That's enough. 
I think we get it.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.579
Mr. Bingham,
I'm here today to inform you

24:57.663 --> 25:00.165
that your position is no longer available.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.834
- I'm fired?
- Yes, you're fired.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.170
- Never say fired.
- You've been let go.

25:05.254 --> 25:07.297
- Why?
- This is a mythical situation.

25:07.381 --> 25:08.923
How could I possibly know why?

25:09.008 --> 25:11.259
Why doesn't matter.
You never know why.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.760
It's important not to focus on the why

25:12.845 --> 25:15.138
and rather to spend your energy
thinking about your future.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.266
Well, I'm gonna spend my energy
on suing you unless you give me

25:18.350 --> 25:19.767
- a good reason why you're firing me.
- Mr. Bingham,

25:19.852 --> 25:20.977
the reason's not important.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.897
So, you're firing me without grounds?
Now I really have a lawsuit.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.398
I get what you're trying to say, Ryan.

25:25.482 --> 25:28.526
- Don't take this personally, Mr. Bingham.
- Personally?

25:28.611 --> 25:31.404
This is the most personal situation
that you are ever gonna enter,

25:31.488 --> 25:34.657
so before you try 
to revolutionize my business,

25:34.742 --> 25:38.119
I'd like to know
that you actually know my business.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.673
That's a hell of a way
to welcome her to the team.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.635
Am I the only one that sees
that by doing this

25:53.719 --> 25:55.553
we're making ourselves irrelevant?

25:55.638 --> 25:58.056
No, frankly, we're making you irrelevant.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.515
- Nice.
- Don't blame me.

25:59.600 --> 26:03.061
Blame the high fuel costs. 
Blame insurance premiums. Blame technology.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.437
You know, you better watch yourself.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.356
You're a little too young
to become a dinosaur.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.815
I'm not a dinosaur.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.400
I want you to show her the ropes.

26:09.485 --> 26:13.112
What do I know what goes on here?
Get Ferguson to do it.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.156
I'm not talking about here.

26:18.661 --> 26:19.953
- No.
- Yeah.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.412
Come on.
You're very, very confident this girl

26:21.497 --> 26:23.081
- doesn't know what she's doing, so...
- Well, I'm sorry.

26:23.165 --> 26:26.626
I don't think a MySpace page qualifies you 
to rewire an entire company.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.127
Well, then great. 
Here's your chance.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.338
Go out there, show her the magic,
take her through the paces.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.382
I'm not a fucking tour guide.

26:35.344 --> 26:36.636
Now here we go.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.846
Bingham, here's the boat.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.350
And here's you.
Do you want to be in the boat?

26:42.434 --> 26:43.893
Yeah, alone.

26:47.189 --> 26:48.898
We're ringing the bell.
We're rounding everybody up.

26:48.983 --> 26:50.233
You want to stay out there
a little bit longer,

26:50.317 --> 26:53.361
you're welcome to do it,
but you will not be alone, okay?

26:53.445 --> 26:55.154
You let me know.

27:11.005 --> 27:12.380
Oh, Christ.

28:03.432 --> 28:05.350
- What?
- Follow me.

28:09.897 --> 28:11.022
I really like my luggage.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.024
That's exactly what it is, 
it's luggage.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.026
You know how much time you lose
by checking in?

28:15.110 --> 28:19.238
- I don't know. Five, 10 minutes?
- Thirty-five minutes a flight.

28:19.323 --> 28:21.866
I travel 270 days a year.

28:21.950 --> 28:25.161
That's 157 hours.
That makes seven days.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.872
You're willing to throw away
an entire week on that?

28:35.923 --> 28:39.175
You don't need this.
Sorry, you don't need that.

28:40.135 --> 28:43.137
You're not gonna need that.
They have neck pillows on the plane.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.681
This, they have better ones there.

28:45.766 --> 28:47.642
I'll get rid of this.

28:49.144 --> 28:50.853
I can just meet you at security.

28:52.314 --> 28:53.648
Thank you.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.611
<i>Bingo, Asians.</i>

28:59.488 --> 29:01.072
You can't be serious.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.199
Never get behind people
traveling with infants.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.993
I've never seen a stroller collapse
in less than 20 minutes.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.203
Old people are worse.

29:07.287 --> 29:08.871
Their bodies are littered
with hidden metal,

29:08.956 --> 29:12.125
and they never seem to appreciate
how little time they have left on earth.

29:12.209 --> 29:13.209
Here you go.

29:13.293 --> 29:17.213
Five words. Randomly selected
for additional screening.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.506
Asians.

29:18.841 --> 29:22.093
They pack light, travel efficiently,
and they've got a thing for slip-on shoes.

29:22.177 --> 29:24.387
- You've got to love them.
- That's racist.

29:24.471 --> 29:27.640
I'm like my mother. I stereotype.
It's faster.

29:56.170 --> 29:57.879
Are you mad at your computer?

29:59.006 --> 30:00.882
I type with purpose.

30:02.718 --> 30:05.178
What is it that you're working on 
so furiously?

30:06.096 --> 30:08.347
I'm building a workflow
of firing techniques.

30:08.432 --> 30:12.018
It's questions and responses,
actions and reactions.

30:12.102 --> 30:15.146
It's a script taking you through
the steps of firing someone.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.814
Who's it for?

30:16.899 --> 30:19.692
Well, theoretically,
you could put it in the hands of anyone

30:19.776 --> 30:21.903
and they'd be downsizing immediately.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.739
All you have to do is follow the steps.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.450
Natalie, what is it you think we do here?

30:28.535 --> 30:29.785
We prepare the newly unemployed

30:29.870 --> 30:31.662
for the emotional and physical hurdles
of job hunting,

30:31.747 --> 30:33.581
while minimizing legal blowback.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.875
That's what we're selling.
It's not what we're doing.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.585
Okay. What are we doing?

30:37.669 --> 30:40.463
We are here to make limbo tolerable,

30:41.256 --> 30:44.675
to ferry wounded souls
across the river of dread

30:44.760 --> 30:48.095
until the point where hope
is dimly visible.

30:50.766 --> 30:54.852
And then stop the boat, shove them
in the water and make them swim.

30:54.937 --> 30:58.940
That was really impressive.
Are you gonna put that in your book?

31:09.952 --> 31:12.036
I got to grab this.
I'll meet you at the car rental.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.371
Okay.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.540
Hey, I was hoping I'd hear from you.

31:15.624 --> 31:18.876
I'm in Hotlanta,
and I need a rib-joint recommend bad.

31:18.961 --> 31:21.003
Fat Matt's. Bring a bib.

31:21.588 --> 31:22.713
You never called.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.132
Well, I wasn't sure
what was appropriate.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.259
Appropriate?

31:26.343 --> 31:29.303
Ryan, I'm not some waitress
you banged in a snowstorm.

31:29.513 --> 31:32.139
<i>That word has no place
in our vocabulary.</i>

31:32.933 --> 31:35.184
I am the woman that you don't have
to worry about.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.521
Sounds like a trap.

31:38.605 --> 31:42.525
Listen, the next time that you're worried
about manners, don't.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.735
If you wanna call, call.

31:44.820 --> 31:48.197
Just think of me as yourself,
only with a vagina.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.783
When am I gonna see you?

31:50.867 --> 31:54.662
Well, I'm out of Hartsfield into IAD,

31:54.746 --> 31:57.582
with a connection at ORD into SDF.

31:58.208 --> 32:01.002
- <i>Sorry.</i>
- Yeah, tell me about it.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.754
How long's your layover?
They got multiples into SDF.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.256
Think you could push?

32:06.925 --> 32:08.593
Yeah, I can push.

32:21.982 --> 32:24.775
All you have to do today
is watch and listen.

32:24.860 --> 32:28.946
And when I talk about a strategy packet,
hand them one of those.

32:29.615 --> 32:30.781
Sounds great.

32:30.866 --> 32:34.035
So, although I wish I were here
with better news,

32:34.328 --> 32:36.871
the fact is that you and I 
are sitting here today

32:36.955 --> 32:41.542
because this will be your last week
of employment at this company.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.794
- Why me?
- What am I supposed to do now?

32:43.879 --> 32:46.922
Am I supposed to feel better
that I'm not the only one losing my job?

32:47.007 --> 32:48.758
This is ridiculous!

32:48.842 --> 32:51.636
I have been a fine employee
for over 10 years,

32:51.720 --> 32:53.471
and this is the way you treat me.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.891
How do you sleep at night, man? How?

32:57.517 --> 33:00.269
How's your family?
They sleeping well at night?

33:00.354 --> 33:02.396
Electricity still on?

33:02.481 --> 33:05.316
Heat still on? 
Refrigerator full of food?

33:06.526 --> 33:08.069
Gas tank full of gas?

33:08.654 --> 33:10.946
Going to Chuck E. Cheese
this weekend or something?

33:11.031 --> 33:12.239
Not me.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.202
No, my kids,
we're not gonna do anything.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.917
What do you suggest I tell them?

33:27.923 --> 33:29.840
Perhaps you're underestimating
the positive effect

33:29.925 --> 33:33.260
that your career transition
can have on your children.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.221
The positive effect?

33:36.139 --> 33:38.808
I make about 90 grand a year now.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.645
Unemployment is what,
250 bucks a week?

33:42.729 --> 33:45.231
Is that one of your positive effects?

33:45.315 --> 33:46.440
Well, we'll get to be cozier,

33:46.525 --> 33:48.859
because I'm not gonna be able
to pay my mortgage on my house.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.403
So, maybe we can move
into a nice fucking

33:50.487 --> 33:52.863
one-bedroom apartment somewhere.

33:53.949 --> 33:55.950
And I guess without benefits,

33:56.034 --> 34:00.663
I'll be able to hold my daughter as she,
you know, suffers from her asthma

34:00.747 --> 34:03.958
that I won't be able to afford
the medication for.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.545
Well, tests have shown that children
under moderate trauma

34:07.629 --> 34:10.965
have a tendency
to apply themselves academically

34:11.967 --> 34:13.926
as a method of coping.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.138
Go fuck yourself.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.474
That's what my kids'll think.

34:20.559 --> 34:23.476
Your children's admiration
is important to you?

34:23.562 --> 34:26.480
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.567
Well, I doubt they ever
admired you, Bob.

34:30.318 --> 34:33.821
Hey, asshole, aren't you supposed
to be consoling me?

34:34.030 --> 34:36.907
I'm not a shrink, Bob. 
I'm a wake-up call.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.659
You know why kids love athletes?

34:38.744 --> 34:40.745
I don't know.
Because they screw lingerie models?

34:40.829 --> 34:42.413
No, that's why we love athletes.

34:42.496 --> 34:46.333
Kids love athletes
because they follow their dreams.

34:49.463 --> 34:52.422
- Well, I can't dunk.
- No, but you can cook.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.592
What are you talking about?

34:54.676 --> 34:58.679
Your résumé says that you minored
in French culinary arts.

34:59.473 --> 35:01.932
Most students,
they work on the fryer at KFC,

35:02.017 --> 35:05.269
but you bussed tables at El Picador
to support yourself.

35:05.353 --> 35:08.939
And then you get out of college
and you come and you work here.

35:09.024 --> 35:12.067
How much did they first pay you
to give up on your dreams?

35:12.736 --> 35:14.487
27 grand a year.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.530
And when were you going to stop

35:16.615 --> 35:19.617
and come back
and do what makes you happy?

35:21.620 --> 35:22.745
Good question.

35:22.829 --> 35:26.499
I see guys who work at the same company 
for their entire lives,

35:26.583 --> 35:28.501
guys exactly like you.

35:28.585 --> 35:30.628
They clock in, they clock out,

35:30.712 --> 35:33.631
and they never have
a moment of happiness.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.927
You have an opportunity here, Bob.

35:38.553 --> 35:40.262
This is a rebirth.

35:41.431 --> 35:44.391
Now, if not for you,
do it for your children.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.090
He just waltzes in and cuts in line?

36:16.174 --> 36:19.844
We reserve priority assistance
for our Hilton Honors members.

36:19.928 --> 36:23.264
The promotions are great.
You should check it out.

36:28.395 --> 36:29.812
Hungry much?

36:30.605 --> 36:34.108
Our business expense
allots $40 each for dinner.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.861
I plan on grabbing
as many miles as I can.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.154
Okay, you got to fill me in
on the miles thing.

36:39.239 --> 36:40.573
What is that about?

36:40.657 --> 36:43.909
Are you talking about, like,
frequent flyer miles?

36:44.202 --> 36:47.246
- You really want to know?
- I'm dying to know.

36:47.914 --> 36:49.582
I don't spend a nickel 
if I can help it

36:49.666 --> 36:52.751
unless it somehow profits
my mileage account.

36:52.836 --> 36:55.546
So, what are you saving up for,
Hawaii, South of France?

36:55.630 --> 36:58.632
It's not like that. 
The miles are the goal.

36:59.801 --> 37:00.968
That's it?

37:01.469 --> 37:03.053
You're saving just to save?

37:03.138 --> 37:05.890
Let's just say that I have a number in mind 
and I haven't hit it yet.

37:05.974 --> 37:08.225
That's a little abstract.
What's the target?

37:09.519 --> 37:10.686
I'd rather not.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.480
Is it a secret target?

37:14.816 --> 37:16.817
It's 10 million miles.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.904
Okay. Isn't 10 million just a number?

37:19.988 --> 37:23.157
- Pi's just a number.
- Well, we all need a hobby.

37:23.658 --> 37:26.744
No, I...
I don't mean to belittle your collection.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.746
I get it. It sounds cool.

37:28.830 --> 37:32.583
I'd be the seventh person to do it.
More people have walked on the moon.

37:32.667 --> 37:36.587
- Do they throw you a parade?
- You get lifetime executive status.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.047
You get to meet the chief pilot,

37:38.131 --> 37:39.214
- Maynard Finch.
- Wow.

37:39.299 --> 37:40.925
And they put your name
on the side of a plane.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.885
Men get such hard-ons
from putting their name on stuff.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.137
You guys don't grow up.
It's like you need to pee on everything.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.680
Now who's stereotyping?

37:46.765 --> 37:50.601
Fear of mortality. It's like,
"Yeah, you're gonna die one day."

37:50.685 --> 37:53.479
And why do you suppose
that's singular to men?

37:53.563 --> 37:55.105
Probably because you can't have babies.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.690
The baby argument.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.489
If I had that many miles,

38:03.865 --> 38:05.407
I would show up at an airport,

38:05.492 --> 38:08.869
look at the destination board,
pick a place and go.

38:44.864 --> 38:46.865
Thanks for the advice.

39:05.468 --> 39:07.094
Oh, Jesus.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.284
Okay. Closer.

39:31.453 --> 39:32.870
Way closer.

39:35.123 --> 39:36.749
Still closer.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.625
Closer. Okay.

39:40.128 --> 39:41.795
A little left.

39:41.963 --> 39:43.964
Okay, down a little.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.717
Too far. Up. 
Up one more inch.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.555
I don't get it. Why does your sister
want a fake photo?

39:51.639 --> 39:54.224
My sister is kooky.
She thinks this is charming.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.476
It's like the gnome thing.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.269
No, I mean,
why would your sister want a fake photo

39:57.353 --> 39:59.146
in front of the St. Louis airport?

39:59.230 --> 40:01.106
Are you kidding, Lambert Field?

40:01.191 --> 40:02.858
The Wright brothers flew through there.

40:02.942 --> 40:06.070
That domed main terminal,
it's the first of its kind.

40:06.154 --> 40:09.239
It's a precursor from everything,
from JFK to de Gaulle.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.992
- Pretty sweet.
- Just take the picture.

40:15.455 --> 40:17.164
Well, that's a keeper.

40:17.499 --> 40:19.124
Let me see it.

40:20.460 --> 40:21.919
Why she wants dozens of reminders

40:22.003 --> 40:24.630
of all the places she hasn't been
is beyond me.

40:24.714 --> 40:27.007
Well, I'm sure she'll be crushed
for having missed this airport.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.009
Look, before Lindbergh 
could cross the Atlantic,

40:29.094 --> 40:31.011
he took off from one of those runways.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.430
Do you ever wonder why they called it
the Spirit of St. Louis?

40:33.515 --> 40:35.307
- No.
- Well...

40:42.899 --> 40:46.443
<i>Do you know how fucked
this place is now?</i>

40:46.528 --> 40:48.570
I am the one thing, the one thing,

40:48.655 --> 40:52.491
preventing this place
from being totally fucked in the ass.

40:58.748 --> 41:01.208
Sometimes they just need to vent.

41:03.878 --> 41:07.297
Please, for the love of God,
can I fire the next one?

41:07.757 --> 41:11.718
- Miss Barnes, thank you for joining us.
- I'm here to be fired, right?

41:12.720 --> 41:14.972
Well, we're here to talk 
about your future.

41:15.056 --> 41:18.142
You don't have to sugarcoat it.
I get the drill.

41:18.226 --> 41:20.018
What are they offering?

41:20.103 --> 41:22.813
Inside the packet, you'll find a clearly
worked out severance package.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.940
Give me the bullet points.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.317
It's actually pretty good.

41:27.402 --> 41:29.653
Three months' pay, 
six months' medical

41:29.737 --> 41:32.656
and a full year of placement services
through our company, CTC.

41:32.740 --> 41:35.534
Placement services. 
That's generous.

41:38.705 --> 41:41.081
Commonly, it takes one month 
of searching for every $10,000

41:41.166 --> 41:42.332
you expect to earn in salary.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.918
So, I could be looking for a while.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.087
- Not necessarily.
- Don't even sweat it.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.173
I'm pretty confident about my plans.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.758
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.179
There's this beautiful bridge
by my house.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.931
I'm gonna go jump off it.

41:59.684 --> 42:00.934
Natalie.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.436
Hey!

42:02.770 --> 42:04.146
Natalie!

42:13.489 --> 42:15.574
People say these things all the time.

42:15.658 --> 42:17.242
It's part of the trade.

42:17.327 --> 42:18.827
- They do?
- Yeah.

42:18.912 --> 42:21.580
I mean, they say crazy things.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.874
They get worked up.

42:24.918 --> 42:26.835
She was really calm.

42:27.295 --> 42:29.463
I think that's a good sign.

42:30.298 --> 42:31.798
So, they don't ever actually do it?

42:31.883 --> 42:33.884
No. No, it's just talk.

42:34.886 --> 42:36.470
How do you know? 
Do you follow up?

42:36.554 --> 42:39.640
I mean, no.
Nothing good's gonna come of that.

42:41.017 --> 42:43.101
I wouldn't worry about it.

42:44.479 --> 42:46.021
This is what we do, Natalie.

42:46.105 --> 42:49.983
We take people at their most fragile,
and we set them adrift.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.324
You ready to go back in?

42:58.117 --> 43:00.410
All right, let's go. 
Come on.

43:44.747 --> 43:47.416
No, I'm fine. 
Tell me something sweet.

43:48.876 --> 43:49.835
I'll be back soon.

43:49.919 --> 43:53.171
I'm not really sure how long
this whole exercise is supposed to last.

43:53.256 --> 43:55.716
No, I don't even think of him that way.
He's old.

44:36.924 --> 44:37.966
I'm done?

44:38.051 --> 44:40.052
I wasn't expecting this. 
Not at all.

44:40.136 --> 44:41.136
Just like that?

44:41.220 --> 44:45.015
I'm disappointed that I've given
so much of my life...

44:45.099 --> 44:46.433
This is not fair.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.894
There are people that are gonna be
way more qualified than me now.

44:48.978 --> 44:51.271
I don't know what to do when I wake up
in the morning tomorrow.

44:59.155 --> 45:00.739
Are you okay?

45:02.575 --> 45:05.410
- Are we going?
- Yeah.

45:23.012 --> 45:25.931
<i>This is how I start every day of my life.</i>

45:28.226 --> 45:31.395
Now, this is gonna be a little difficult,
so stay with me.

45:31.479 --> 45:33.397
You have a new backpack.

45:33.481 --> 45:36.900
Only this time,
I want you to fill it with people.

45:37.151 --> 45:40.529
Start with casual acquaintances,
friends of friends,

45:41.155 --> 45:42.906
folks around the office.

45:42.990 --> 45:44.074
And then you move into the people

45:44.158 --> 45:46.159
that you trust with
your most intimate secrets.

45:46.244 --> 45:48.912
Your cousins, your aunts, your uncles,

45:48.996 --> 45:51.873
your brothers, your sisters, your parents.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.504
And finally your husband, your wife,
your boyfriend or your girlfriend.

45:59.006 --> 46:01.508
You get them into that backpack.

46:03.052 --> 46:06.263
Don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you
to light it on fire.

46:08.182 --> 46:09.808
Feel the weight of that bag.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.103
Make no mistake,
your relationships are the heaviest

46:13.187 --> 46:15.230
components in your life.

46:16.941 --> 46:20.277
Do you feel the straps
cutting into your shoulders?

46:21.904 --> 46:27.200
All those negotiations and arguments
and secrets and compromises.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.832
<i>You don't need to carry all that weight.</i>

46:34.208 --> 46:36.626
<i>Why don't you set that bag down?</i>

46:38.671 --> 46:41.047
Some animals were meant
to carry each other,

46:41.132 --> 46:43.800
to live symbiotically for a lifetime.

46:44.594 --> 46:46.970
Star-crossed lovers,
monogamous swans.

46:47.054 --> 46:49.055
We are not those animals.

46:51.726 --> 46:54.311
The slower we move, the faster we die.

46:54.395 --> 46:56.563
We are not swans.

46:58.191 --> 46:59.733
We're sharks.

47:13.915 --> 47:15.373
- <i>Never?</i>
- <i>No.</i> 

47:15.958 --> 47:17.417
- <i>Ever?</i>
- <i>No.</i>

47:18.127 --> 47:20.420
- You never want to get married?
- Nope.

47:20.505 --> 47:22.839
- Never want kids?
- Not a chance.

47:22.924 --> 47:24.758
- Ever?
- Never.

47:25.635 --> 47:28.261
- Is that so bizarre?
- Yes.

47:28.721 --> 47:30.138
Yes, it is.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.058
I just don't see the value in it.

47:33.893 --> 47:36.394
- All right, sell it to me.
- What?

47:36.479 --> 47:38.271
Sell me marriage.

47:39.941 --> 47:42.442
- Okay, how about love?
- Okay.

47:43.819 --> 47:46.363
Stability, just somebody
you can count on.

47:46.447 --> 47:48.448
How many stable marriages
do you know?

47:48.533 --> 47:51.451
Somebody to talk to,
someone to spend your life with.

47:51.536 --> 47:55.539
I'm surrounded by people to talk to.
I doubt that's going to change.

47:56.415 --> 47:58.792
How about just not dying alone?

47:59.460 --> 48:00.585
Starting when I was 12,

48:00.670 --> 48:03.338
we moved each one of my grandparents 
into a nursing facility.

48:03.422 --> 48:05.215
My parents went the same way.

48:05.299 --> 48:07.801
Make no mistake, we all die alone.

48:08.135 --> 48:12.806
Now, those cult members in San Diego
with the Kool-Aid and the sneakers,

48:13.307 --> 48:15.058
they didn't die alone.

48:15.142 --> 48:17.769
I'm just saying there are options.

48:20.773 --> 48:22.232
Fuck.

48:23.693 --> 48:25.277
Brian left me.

48:32.827 --> 48:34.286
All right.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.331
Okay, okay. 
All right.

48:40.334 --> 48:41.793
All right.

48:44.088 --> 48:45.213
Yeah.

48:51.554 --> 48:52.679
Hey.

48:56.767 --> 48:59.978
Natalie, this is Alex, my friend.
This is Natalie.

49:01.439 --> 49:03.481
I should give you both a moment.

49:03.566 --> 49:05.317
No. No, that's fine.

49:05.401 --> 49:08.111
I'm fine. 
It's a pleasure to meet you.

49:09.071 --> 49:12.866
Maybe we should just all go up
to our rooms and freshen up.

49:13.326 --> 49:14.618
Or maybe a drink?

49:14.702 --> 49:15.785
Now you're talking.

49:19.332 --> 49:21.791
He broke up with you
over text message?

49:21.876 --> 49:25.170
It's kind of like firing someone
over the Internet.

49:26.964 --> 49:28.173
What a weaselly prick.

49:28.257 --> 49:30.425
Yeah. But what does that make me?

49:30.509 --> 49:33.053
- Someone who falls for a prick.
- We all fall for them.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.930
Pricks are spontaneous, 
they're unpredictable, and they're fun.

49:36.015 --> 49:39.309
And then we're surprised
when they turn out to be pricks.

49:39.393 --> 49:41.478
I followed him to Omaha.

49:41.562 --> 49:42.979
You did?

49:43.564 --> 49:44.814
I had a job waiting for me
in San Francisco

49:44.899 --> 49:47.400
when he got an offer from ConAgra.

49:48.861 --> 49:51.029
He said we could start a life together.

49:52.239 --> 49:53.740
So, I followed him.

49:53.824 --> 49:55.283
To Nebraska?

49:58.454 --> 50:00.580
I thought I'd be engaged by now.

50:01.415 --> 50:02.832
No offense.

50:02.917 --> 50:05.293
- None taken.
- That's all right.

50:06.587 --> 50:09.673
When I was 16,
I thought by 23 I'd be married,

50:10.424 --> 50:11.466
maybe have a kid,

50:11.550 --> 50:14.594
corner office by day,
entertaining at night.

50:14.679 --> 50:16.596
I was supposed to be driving
a Grand Cherokee by now.

50:16.681 --> 50:19.599
Yeah, life can underwhelm you that way.

50:20.101 --> 50:23.019
I mean, where did you think
you'd be by...

50:26.273 --> 50:27.440
It doesn't work that way.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.567
At a certain point,
you stop with the deadlines.

50:29.652 --> 50:31.403
It can be a little counterproductive.

50:31.487 --> 50:33.488
I don't want to say anything
that's anti-feminist.

50:33.572 --> 50:36.908
I really appreciate everything
that your generation did for me.

50:36.992 --> 50:38.493
- It was our pleasure.
- Well done.

50:38.577 --> 50:41.538
But sometimes it feels like
no matter how much success I have,

50:41.622 --> 50:44.249
it's not gonna matter
until I find the right guy.

50:45.167 --> 50:47.585
You really thought this guy
was the one?

50:48.170 --> 50:49.963
I could have made it work.

50:50.423 --> 50:53.174
He... He really fit the bill.

50:53.759 --> 50:55.760
- You know?
- The bill?

50:55.845 --> 50:57.804
White-collar, college grad,

50:58.264 --> 51:02.809
loves dogs, likes funny movies,
6'1", brown hair, kind eyes,

51:02.893 --> 51:07.021
works in finance but is outdoorsy,
you know, on the weekends.

51:08.524 --> 51:14.821
I always imagined he'd have a single 
syllable name like Matt or John or Dave.

51:16.407 --> 51:18.241
In a perfect world, he drives a 4Runner.

51:18.325 --> 51:22.162
And the only thing he loves
more than me is his golden Lab.

51:23.497 --> 51:25.165
And a nice smile.

51:28.043 --> 51:30.336
- What about you?
- Let me think.

51:33.174 --> 51:35.216
You know, honestly,
by the time you're 34,

51:35.301 --> 51:38.052
all the physical requirements
just go out the window.

51:38.137 --> 51:42.015
I mean, like, you secretly pray
that he'll be taller than you,

51:43.017 --> 51:44.642
and not an asshole would be nice.

51:44.727 --> 51:47.604
Just someone who enjoys my company,
comes from a good family.

51:47.688 --> 51:50.398
Because you don't think about that
when you're younger.

51:50.483 --> 51:53.276
I don't know. 
Someone who wants kids.

51:54.111 --> 51:56.196
Likes kids. Wants kids.

51:57.239 --> 51:59.866
Healthy enough to play with his kids.

52:03.120 --> 52:06.247
Please let him earn more money
than I do.

52:06.332 --> 52:09.292
You might not understand that now,
but believe me, you will one day.

52:09.376 --> 52:12.212
Otherwise, that's a recipe for disaster.

52:13.881 --> 52:16.466
And hopefully some hair on his head,

52:16.884 --> 52:20.386
but, I mean, even that's not
a deal breaker these days.

52:23.808 --> 52:25.391
A nice smile.

52:27.520 --> 52:30.730
Yeah, a nice smile.
Nice smile just might do it.

52:33.734 --> 52:35.735
Wow, that was depressing.

52:37.530 --> 52:40.114
- I should just date women.
- Tried it.

52:40.741 --> 52:42.909
We're no picnic ourselves.

52:46.497 --> 52:48.957
I don't mind being married to my career,

52:50.209 --> 52:53.837
and I don't expect it to hold me in bed
as I fall asleep.

52:57.716 --> 53:00.051
I just don't want to settle.

53:00.553 --> 53:04.389
You're young. Right now you see settling 
as some sort of a failure.

53:04.473 --> 53:07.141
It is, by definition.

53:07.935 --> 53:12.313
Yeah. But by the time someone is right 
for you, it won't feel like settling.

53:12.398 --> 53:13.857
And the only person left to judge you

53:13.941 --> 53:17.652
will be the 23-year-old girl
with a target on your back.

53:21.365 --> 53:23.908
So, what's the plan for the evening?

53:24.201 --> 53:28.454
Well, we were gonna hit that party
for the tech conference at the hotel.

53:28.539 --> 53:30.248
I didn't know you could just attend those.

53:30.332 --> 53:32.542
I thought you had to be registered.

53:32.626 --> 53:34.002
Well, technically, I don't think

53:34.086 --> 53:36.796
- it's open to the public.
- Just gonna stop by.

53:37.214 --> 53:39.299
You're gonna crash it?

53:39.884 --> 53:41.968
- They throw a really nice party.
- Well, they have more money

53:42.052 --> 53:44.470
- than they know what to do with.
- And they have a good time, usually.

53:44.555 --> 53:46.806
No, no, I get it. I'm in.

54:07.786 --> 54:09.370
Jennifer Chu?

54:09.997 --> 54:11.998
- Shit!
- It'll be fine.

54:34.688 --> 54:36.356
Doing all right?

54:38.150 --> 54:40.276
Yeah. This was a great idea.

54:42.446 --> 54:44.155
You're so pretty.

54:45.115 --> 54:48.368
You're exactly
what I wanna look like in 15 years.

54:48.786 --> 54:50.578
Thank you, Natalie.

54:50.829 --> 54:52.538
You should dance.

54:56.293 --> 54:57.377
- Come on.
- No, no, no.

54:57.461 --> 54:59.003
Come on.

55:16.814 --> 55:19.065
- Hi. I'm Dave.
- I'm Natalie.

55:20.150 --> 55:21.776
Who's Jennifer?

55:23.445 --> 55:24.946
I don't know.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.200
<i>All right.
How's everybody doing out there?</i>

55:30.869 --> 55:34.247
All right. Right about now, give it up
for a very special alpha TECH guest.

55:34.331 --> 55:36.416
Young MC!

55:38.752 --> 55:40.628
What's up, alpha TECH?

55:40.921 --> 55:44.298
I got a busted computer at home.
Can somebody fix it for me?

56:18.083 --> 56:19.042
<i>Bust a move!</i>

56:19.126 --> 56:20.501
- <i>Say, "Yeah!"</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>

56:20.669 --> 56:22.795
- <i>Say, "Oh, yeah!"</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah!</i>

56:22.880 --> 56:24.922
- <i>Say, "Bust a move!"</i>
- <i>Bust a move!</i>

56:25.007 --> 56:26.549
- <i>Say, "Bust a move!"</i>
- <i>Bust a move!</i>

56:26.633 --> 56:29.093
- <i>Let me hear you say, "Yeah!"</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>

56:32.806 --> 56:35.975
I want you to have a key to my place.

56:38.353 --> 56:42.774
Wow. I had no idea we were
at that point in our relationship.

56:42.983 --> 56:44.609
- Yes.
- Wow.

56:49.448 --> 56:50.615
Where is she?

56:50.824 --> 56:54.410
<i>Lying in my bed I hear the</i> 

56:54.495 --> 56:58.081
<i>Clock tick and think of you</i>

56:58.165 --> 57:01.125
<i>Caught up in circles</i>

57:01.210 --> 57:05.421
<i>Confusion is nothing new</i>

57:05.506 --> 57:06.923
<i>Flash back</i>

57:07.007 --> 57:09.175
<i>To warm nights</i>

57:09.426 --> 57:11.844
<i>Almost left behind</i>

57:12.763 --> 57:16.766
<i>Suitcase of memories</i>

57:16.850 --> 57:18.434
<i>Time after</i>

57:18.519 --> 57:21.354
<i>Sometimes you picture me...</i> 

57:26.068 --> 57:28.820
Back home I don't get to act 
the way I do with you.

57:28.904 --> 57:32.782
- That's why I don't have a back home.
- I know.

57:33.033 --> 57:34.700
You're so cool.

57:35.202 --> 57:37.203
Mr. Empty Backpack.

57:38.705 --> 57:40.498
- You know about my backpack?
- I googled you.

57:40.582 --> 57:41.833
You did?

57:41.917 --> 57:44.460
It's what us modern girls do
when we have a crush.

57:45.838 --> 57:47.296
Did it bother you?

57:47.381 --> 57:48.548
It depends.

57:48.632 --> 57:50.925
Is the bag empty
because you hate people

57:51.009 --> 57:53.094
or because you hate the baggage
that they come along with?

57:53.178 --> 57:55.638
I don't hate people.
I'm not exactly a hermit.

57:55.722 --> 58:00.226
You just don't want to be tied down
with the whole responsibility thing?

58:00.644 --> 58:03.813
I don't know what originally 
sparked the backpack.

58:03.897 --> 58:05.898
Probably needed to be alone.

58:07.359 --> 58:11.404
Recently, I've been thinking
that I needed to empty the backpack

58:11.989 --> 58:14.657
before I knew what to put back in it.

58:32.926 --> 58:36.220
- <i>Oh, no!</i>
- <i>I think we're out of gas.</i>

59:17.304 --> 59:18.971
Hey. You're up?

59:19.806 --> 59:23.142
Yeah, I have to fly standby
and make a meeting in Cincinnati.

59:25.145 --> 59:26.270
Okay.

59:27.940 --> 59:29.857
I made you feel cheap.

59:30.609 --> 59:33.986
It's all right.
Just leave the money on the dresser.

59:34.821 --> 59:37.823
I'll text you later
so we can swap schedules.

59:41.203 --> 59:42.328
Hey.

59:44.331 --> 59:46.040
I really like you.

59:47.417 --> 59:50.419
- I like you, too.
- Good.

59:52.839 --> 59:54.632
Go catch your plane.

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:08.854
Last night...

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:12.650
It was kind of out of hand,
and I said things...

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:17.238
I'm not actually sure 
of everything that I said,

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:20.116
- but I didn't want you to think...
- Just relax.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.702
It was nice to see you cut loose.

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:25.329
So, did you wake him up or slip out?

01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:29.792
- What?
- This morning. Your new friend.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.377
Did you wake him up
for an awkward goodbye

01:00:31.461 --> 01:00:34.547
or did you just slip out
and make him feel like a whore?

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:39.677
- I just left.
- Protocol's always tricky.

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:44.849
What happened to Alex?

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:47.018
She had to leave town early
to get to a meeting.

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:50.271
- That's too bad. Where does she live?
- Chicago.

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:53.065
Thinking of going to see her?

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.484
We don't really have that kind of relationship. 
Try right over there.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:57.153
That direction.

01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:00.906
What kind of relationship do you have?

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:03.534
Well, you know, casual.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:07.413
- Sounds pretty special.
- It works for us.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:12.126
Don't you think there's a future there?

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:14.503
I never really thought about it.
What's going on here?

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:17.131
- Really never thought about it?
- No.

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:21.010
How can you not think about that?

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.595
How does it not even cross your mind

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:24.388
that you might want
a future with someone?

01:01:24.473 --> 01:01:27.516
It's simple. You know that moment
when you look into somebody's eyes

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:29.894
and you can feel them
staring into your soul

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:33.522
and the whole world goes quiet
just for a second?

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.816
- Yes.
- Right. Well, I don't.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:39.070
- You're an asshole.
- No.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:40.988
Look, I'm just dicking around. 
Come on. Give me a hand.

01:01:41.073 --> 01:01:42.531
Don't you think it's worth
giving her a chance?

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:45.368
- A chance to what?
- A chance at something real.

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:48.162
Natalie, your definition of real
is going to evolve as you get older.

01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:50.164
Can you stop condescending
for one second

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:52.833
or is that one of the principles
of your bullshit philosophy?

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:55.544
- Bullshit philosophy?
- The isolation, the traveling.

01:01:55.629 --> 01:01:58.172
- Is that supposed to be charming?
- No, it's simply a life choice.

01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:01.509
- It's a cocoon of self-banishment.
- Wow. Big words.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.177
Screw you.

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:05.012
Screw you, too.

01:02:05.097 --> 01:02:07.598
You have set up a way of life
that basically makes it impossible

01:02:07.682 --> 01:02:09.600
for you to have any kind 
of human connection.

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:11.018
And now this woman comes along

01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:14.522
and somehow runs the gauntlet
of your ridiculous life choice

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:18.192
and comes out on the other end smiling
just so you can call her "casual"?

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:21.070
I need to grow up? 
You're a 12-year-old.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.656
I don't have a gauntlet...

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:27.993
Fuck.

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:11.787
Now, listen,
these Detroit guys can be tough.

01:03:11.872 --> 01:03:12.997
They've been getting hammered.

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:15.124
So, you don't get distracted.
Stick with the simple stuff.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:19.545
You get these packets in their hand
and you get them out the door, okay?

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:34.560
<i>Hey, welcome to Detroit.</i>

01:03:35.061 --> 01:03:36.312
What's going on here?

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:38.439
<i>I've been looking at those great numbers 
over the last few days.</i>

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:40.774
<i>I thought maybe we should just nut up
and give this a try.</i>

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.151
We could use a little more time.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:45.154
<i>Well, you got to leave the nest
at some point, huh?</i>

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:47.865
This is a real company, Craig.
We're here to do some damage.

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:50.159
<i>I know. It's a good thing
we brought our best, okay.</i>

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:51.702
<i>Let's stop screwing around.</i>

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:54.872
All right. Just give me a minute to prepare 
and get my things together.

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:58.334
<i>I was thinking that Natalie
was going to take this one.</i>

01:03:58.418 --> 01:03:59.919
She's hardly ready for that.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:02.213
<i>I've been watching her results
the last few days. She's great.</i>

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:03.672
This is a whole other animal.

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:05.799
<i>You know, she created it
and everything, right?</i>

01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:08.260
<i>Natalie, are you not up for it?</i>

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:12.848
- Yeah, I'm game.
- <i>That's my girl.</i>

01:04:14.267 --> 01:04:18.437
Just remember, don't apologize,
don't tell them how hard this is for you.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:20.856
Today's one of the worst days
they're ever gonna have in their life.

01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:23.442
How we feel doesn't even compare.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.362
- Got it.
- All right. Just keep it professional.

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:27.947
You'll be fine.

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:33.911
<i>What's all this? 
What's going on?</i>

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:37.748
Hello, Mr. Samuels.
I wish I were here with better news.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:43.462
However, your position here at Wertheimer's 
is no longer available.

01:04:43.547 --> 01:04:45.756
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:48.634
You've been let go.

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.303
<i>Just like that?</i>

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:54.682
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:58.060
My name is Miss Keener,

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:00.854
and I'm here today
to talk about your options.

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:03.691
<i>I worked for this company for 17 years</i>

01:05:03.775 --> 01:05:06.485
<i>and they send a fourth-grader to can me?</i>

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:09.822
<i>What the fuck is this?</i>

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:21.542
It's perfectly normal to be upset.

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:24.253
However, the sooner you can
tell yourself that greater

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:26.088
- opportunities are waiting for you...
- Greater opportunities?

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:28.424
<i>I'm 57 fucking years old.</i>

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:33.846
Anybody who ever built an empire
or changed the world

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:35.347
sat where you are now.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:41.437
And it's because they sat there
that they were able to do it.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:49.570
There's a packet in front of you. 
I want you to take some time and review it.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:54.700
All the answers you're looking for
are inside those pages.

01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:00.205
The sooner you trust the process,

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:03.959
the sooner the next step of your life
will unveil itself.

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:12.926
I need you to go back to your office now

01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:16.096
and start putting together
your personal things.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:36.909
Mr. Samuels, 
that's all we can discuss now.

01:06:41.206 --> 01:06:42.706
Mr. Samuels.

01:06:51.758 --> 01:06:53.300
Mr. Samuels.

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:58.847
Mr. Samuels!

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:16.699
You did it good.

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:21.578
You okay? 
You want me to take over?

01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:23.580
No, I'm all right.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.390
No. Look, we just got here.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:44.226
That's one place.
I think we need to try a few more.

01:07:45.437 --> 01:07:46.437
Maybe it doesn't make a difference,

01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:49.022
but it's comforting to know
that we're in the next room.

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:52.234
I know you don't give a shit
about my comfort.

01:07:52.819 --> 01:07:55.904
I think we could try a few more,
that's all I'm saying.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:00.909
Fine.

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:06.498
All right. Okay. All right.

01:08:13.381 --> 01:08:17.760
He thought you did a great job.
You did. I'm real proud of you.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.179
Thanks.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:25.184
They're pulling us off the road.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:28.520
We're going home.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:31.314
Really? For good?

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:33.649
Yeah.

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.279
Good job.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:06.975
I'm sorry about what I said about Alex.
That was out of line.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.977
It's all right. I understand.

01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:12.648
I mean, who am I to be doling out
relationship advice, right?

01:09:12.732 --> 01:09:14.149
No kidding.

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.531
Are you gonna be okay?

01:09:21.366 --> 01:09:23.575
- What do you mean?
- In Omaha?

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:28.121
I don't know.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:32.626
It's better than you'd think.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.303
Ryan.

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:45.973
Ryan. Where are you going?

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:48.725
I'm grabbing another flight.
Something I've got to take care of.

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:50.935
I'll see you back at home.

01:10:10.331 --> 01:10:12.708
Okay, just walk it in a little.

01:10:13.084 --> 01:10:14.626
<i>A little more.</i>

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:17.379
<i>There you go. 
Yeah.</i>

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:22.384
Got it.

01:10:26.097 --> 01:10:27.973
They're a cute couple.

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:31.310
- You think so?
- Yeah, they'll make cute kids.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:35.314
How do you like Wisconsin in February?

01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:38.275
I like it if you're there.

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:40.319
And I know a killer burger in Milwaukee.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.279
Northern Wisconsin.

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:46.408
What are you doing this weekend?

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:49.828
- No.
- What, I haven't...

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:53.707
- Well, you want me to be your date?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:57.711
- At your sister's wedding?
- It's not like I know her that well.

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.881
Look, I'm not the wedding type, right?

01:11:01.215 --> 01:11:04.259
But for the first time in my life,
I don't want to be that guy alone at a bar.

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:07.137
I want a dance partner.
I want a "plus one."

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:10.557
And if you can stomach it,
I'd like it to be you.

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:38.043
Excuse me. 
Are you available?

01:11:38.503 --> 01:11:41.838
This line's for members
of our Matterhorn Program.

01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:48.845
Hey. Ryan.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:52.808
- Hey.
- Kara. Hi.

01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:55.185
- Hi.
- Hey. Hi.

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:56.812
Alex, this is my sister Kara.

01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:58.563
- Hi.
- Well, hello.

01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:02.734
Ryan's told me nothing about you.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.238
So, you two are dating?

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:11.284
- Not exactly.
- Well, hey, don't worry about it.

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:14.621
We're all getting a little old
to be calling someone girlfriend.

01:12:14.706 --> 01:12:17.165
I remember when Mom
used to call Jack her boyfriend.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:21.169
God. Drove me up the wall.
Boyfriends are for kids, right?

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:24.881
So, what are you doing at the hotel?

01:12:24.966 --> 01:12:30.554
Yeah. Okay, Frank and I 
are trying out a trial separation.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:32.681
I'm sorry.
So, you're not staying at the house?

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:34.766
No, there was a room on hold here,

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:37.686
so I thought I'd just take it
for the weekend.

01:12:40.398 --> 01:12:43.483
- So, the rehearsal dinner.
- Yeah, tonight. I'll see you two there.

01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:49.364
Nice digs.

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:54.202
There's a packet.

01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:02.419
Hey, look who's here.

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:04.504
- Oh, my God!
- He finally made it.

01:13:04.589 --> 01:13:06.715
- Oh, my God! Ryan!
- Hey.

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:09.801
Hi.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:14.389
- You must be Alex.
- Yes, I am. Hi. How are you?

01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:17.434
- You are so beautiful. Kara was right.
- Thank you.

01:13:19.562 --> 01:13:23.774
Gosh. You look so grown-up.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.068
I do?
You're the one that's getting married.

01:13:26.152 --> 01:13:27.903
I know, right?

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:31.448
You haven't even seen my ring.

01:13:32.867 --> 01:13:34.743
- Look at that.
- It's lovely.

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:37.454
- Jim designed it.
- That's...

01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:39.039
Hey, Jim.

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:43.335
- Hey.
- How's it going?

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.962
- Hey. I'm Ryan.
- Jim. Good to meet you.

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:48.173
- Alex. Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:51.426
Thank you, guys, for coming.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:53.220
Brother!

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:57.933
- It's true, though.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:01.103
I got the pictures you asked me to get.

01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:03.688
You can just put them right there.

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:07.359
Yeah, okay.

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:38.849
You got so many of them up there,
I almost didn't have room.

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:42.144
I know. It's so great.
Everyone just chipped in.

01:14:43.062 --> 01:14:45.981
What gave you the idea
to do something so...

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:47.065
Substantial.

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:53.113
Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg
invested in this real estate venture.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.866
It's a real estate investment.

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:58.910
It's exciting,
but we went over our finances and...

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:00.912
A honeymoon just kind of 
at this state in the game

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.998
just doesn't really seem affordable.

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:05.250
So, you know, we just thought,

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:08.920
"Just because we can't travel
doesn't mean we can't have pictures."

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:11.631
- No, I think that's a fabulous idea.
- Yeah, it's a good one.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:14.467
I mean, the concept is turnkey everything.

01:15:14.552 --> 01:15:17.053
Okay? You buy a maintenance contract
when you get the home.

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:19.472
You know, we'll whack your weeds,
we'll change your light bulbs.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:20.932
Furniture, you can bring your own

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:23.226
or else you can pick one
of our beautiful packages.

01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:26.021
Seamless traditionalism,
yet all the perks.

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:27.355
Nice.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.191
And we all need a place to call our own.

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:32.402
This is America.
This is what we were promised.

01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:35.197
- It's a nice touch.
- What?

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:38.533
The bit at the end about the promise.
I like that part.

01:15:38.618 --> 01:15:40.285
Thanks.

01:15:42.914 --> 01:15:46.249
You... You still renting 
that one-bedroom?

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:49.878
- No. I gave it up.
- So, you own now?

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.088
- No.
- But you're looking?

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:54.883
No, not really.

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:58.136
So, you're just good?

01:15:58.846 --> 01:16:00.222
I'm good.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.307
Well, that's good.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:05.727
Can you believe it's tomorrow?
How are you gonna sleep?

01:16:05.811 --> 01:16:07.312
I don't know.

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:11.316
- Well, do you want some Xanax?
- I don't think that's for sleeping.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:15.153
Yeah. No, I think I'll just have
a glass of warm milk.

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:18.031
- That'll do the trick.
- Okay. See you tomorrow.

01:16:18.115 --> 01:16:19.407
- Okay.
- Bye.

01:16:19.492 --> 01:16:20.492
Bye.

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:22.911
Hey. There's another box inside.

01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:24.704
- I'll grab it.
- You sure?

01:16:24.789 --> 01:16:26.498
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:38.927
- Jim seems like a good guy.
- Yeah, isn't he great?

01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:41.680
He's going to make a great husband.

01:16:43.391 --> 01:16:45.267
You know, Julie, I was thinking,

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:48.103
you know, with Dad not being here,

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:53.692
I was wondering if you had anybody
to walk you down the aisle.

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:56.695
Yeah.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:00.532
No, Jim's uncle is gonna do it.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.159
He's been really supportive.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.120
He's been great.

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:08.331
Well, good. That's great.
I just wanted to make sure that you...

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:12.043
I wanted you to be covered, that's all.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:17.632
So, I should be there, what?

01:17:17.717 --> 01:17:20.135
Yeah, the guests are arriving around 5:00,

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:24.306
and things get going at 5:30,
so around then.

01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:25.765
Okay.

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:32.564
Let me... 
I'm gonna help you with those.

01:17:33.274 --> 01:17:34.566
Got it.

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:38.069
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.165
None of that was here.

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:52.000
This is all new.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:04.512
Really?

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:07.849
- Is that all you got?
- What?

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.108
Give me a boost.

01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:20.445
Watch...

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:22.864
Hang on.

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:31.831
I took Geography in here.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.502
You ever fool around
with one of your teachers?

01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:38.630
- No. Did you?
- No. Not until college.

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:46.304
That's me on the right.

01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:50.266
It's kind of hard to tell.

01:18:50.351 --> 01:18:52.811
You can tell by the eyebrows.

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:56.022
- You played basketball?
- I was a point guard.

01:18:56.107 --> 01:18:57.565
Don't act so surprised.

01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:00.235
I didn't know you were such a jock.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.695
That's me, too.

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:05.323
And that.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:10.245
- My first fight.
- How'd it go?

01:19:10.329 --> 01:19:12.080
Got my ass kicked.

01:19:12.415 --> 01:19:15.667
This is where we used to go to make out.

01:19:16.377 --> 01:19:19.587
Yes. Yeah. 
This is very romantic.

01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:27.595
Go, Cougars!

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:35.562
I'm really happy I came here.

01:19:35.729 --> 01:19:37.272
So am I.

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:44.446
It's Kara.

01:19:45.698 --> 01:19:47.532
- Hey.
- Ryan, where are you?

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:49.242
We're having a meltdown here.

01:19:49.368 --> 01:19:50.410
What's going on? 
What happened?

01:19:50.494 --> 01:19:52.912
It's Jim. Can you get back here?
We need your help.

01:19:52.997 --> 01:19:54.289
Okay.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.542
We got to go.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.006
- I'll grab your suit.
- Thanks.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:25.487
- What happened?
- Jim's got cold feet.

01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:28.448
- Today?
- Yeah, that's how cold feet work.

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:31.117
- What do you want me to do?
- Talk to him.

01:20:31.202 --> 01:20:34.245
- You want me to talk to him?
- Hey, it's either you or me.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:36.998
You know my track record.
I've already struck out once.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:39.334
I haven't been to bat.
I haven't been in the dugout.

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:41.794
Don't you talk for a living?
Motivational-type stuff?

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:44.088
I tell people how to avoid commitment.

01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:46.341
What kind of fucked-up message is that?

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:47.884
- It's a philosophy.
- It's stupid.

01:20:47.968 --> 01:20:49.761
Hey, it could have helped you.

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:55.725
Ryan, you haven't been around much.
Fuck, basically, you don't exist to us.

01:20:56.936 --> 01:20:58.978
I know you wanna be there for her.

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:02.815
Well, here it is. 
This is your chance.

01:21:24.672 --> 01:21:26.673
Hey. What's up, Ryan?

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.718
- Jim.
- You ever read this before?

01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:35.473
- Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.
- Yeah, I'll say.

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:43.982
Kara mentioned that
you were having some thoughts.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:48.820
I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this.

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:52.574
And why would you say that today?

01:21:54.201 --> 01:21:58.413
Well, last night I was kind of laying in bed 
and I couldn't get to sleep,

01:21:58.497 --> 01:22:00.790
so I started thinking about 
the wedding and the ceremony,

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:04.794
and about our buying a house
and moving in together,

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:07.755
and having a kid
and then having another kid.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.759
And then Christmas
and Thanksgiving and spring break

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:15.179
and going to football games. And then,
all of a sudden, they're graduating,

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.098
they're getting jobs,
and they're getting married,

01:22:17.182 --> 01:22:19.434
and, you know, I'm a grandparent.

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:23.021
And then I'm retired. I'm losing my hair.
I'm getting fat.

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:25.315
And then the next thing you know,
I'm dead.

01:22:25.399 --> 01:22:29.360
I'm just, like... I can't stop from thinking,
"What's the point?"

01:22:33.073 --> 01:22:36.909
- I mean, what is the point?
- The point?

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:39.662
Yeah, I mean, what am I starting here?

01:22:41.582 --> 01:22:44.125
Jim, it's marriage.

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:49.881
It's one of the most beautiful things on earth. 
It's what people aspire to.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:53.134
- You never got married.
- That's true.

01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:57.096
- I mean, you never even tried.
- Well, it's hard to define try.

01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:58.640
I don't know, just...

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.892
You seem happier
than all my married friends.

01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:07.190
Look, Jim, I'm not gonna lie to you.
Marriage can be a pain in the ass.

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:12.153
And you're kind of right. This all is just stuff 
that leads to your eventual demise.

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:14.322
- Yes.
- And we're all on running clocks,

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:16.574
and they can't be slowed down or paused,

01:23:16.659 --> 01:23:20.161
and, you know,
we all end up in the same place.

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:21.579
Yeah.

01:23:23.374 --> 01:23:24.624
There is no point.

01:23:24.708 --> 01:23:27.418
There is no point.
That's what I'm saying.

01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:34.133
You know,

01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:38.680
I'm not normally the guy
you would talk to about stuff like this.

01:23:42.810 --> 01:23:44.811
If you think about it,

01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:50.983
your favorite memories, 
the most important moments in your life,

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:52.610
were you alone?

01:23:54.655 --> 01:23:56.197
No, I guess not.

01:23:57.449 --> 01:24:01.202
Hey, come to think of it, last night,
the night before your wedding,

01:24:01.286 --> 01:24:03.204
when all this shit
is swirling around in your head,

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:05.540
weren't you guys
sleeping in separate bedrooms?

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:07.458
Yeah, Julie went back to the apartment,

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:10.628
and I was just by myself
in the honeymoon suite.

01:24:10.713 --> 01:24:13.965
- Kind of lonely, huh?
- Yes, it was pretty lonely.

01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:19.971
- Life's better with company.
- Yeah.

01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:23.266
Everybody needs a co-pilot.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.687
- That was a nice touch.
- Thanks.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:34.736
-So, what's the mood like out there?
-It's not good.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.905
- She's pretty pissed?
- She's upset.

01:24:40.743 --> 01:24:42.410
What should I do?

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:45.705
Go get her.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:03.681
I'm such a fuck-up. 
I love you so much.

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:06.392
Will you be my co-pilot?

01:25:08.604 --> 01:25:10.563
Yes. Yes.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.820
Welcome home.

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:55.686
Okay, this is your stop.

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:07.114
- When am I gonna see you?
- You're just gonna have to come visit.

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:09.492
So settled.

01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:13.204
You're not gonna change on me, are you?

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:16.791
No. Same guy. 
Just one address.

01:28:18.794 --> 01:28:20.086
<i>This is your final boarding call</i>

01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:23.214
<i>for American Airlines
flight number 3972 to Chicago.</i>

01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:27.969
All right. 
Call me when you get lonely.

01:28:31.223 --> 01:28:32.640
I'm lonely.

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:07.967
<i>Some guy sits down
in a conference room somewhere</i>

01:29:08.051 --> 01:29:11.595
<i>and our server routes his session
to one of our termination engineers.</i>

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:13.514
"Termination engineers"? Really?

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:16.058
I preferred "terminators,"
but it bumped with Legal.

01:29:16.143 --> 01:29:17.601
Can't imagine why.

01:29:17.686 --> 01:29:19.687
They follow a workflow
that takes them through anything

01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:21.313
from a standard dismissal
to a violent aggressor.

01:29:21.398 --> 01:29:23.941
What are they doing now?
Are they practicing?

01:29:24.026 --> 01:29:27.445
Well, beta testing, role-playing.
We go live at the end of the month.

01:29:28.238 --> 01:29:30.406
Kyle, you're running 
through the events too quickly.

01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:32.658
You need to give them time
to acknowledge each statement, okay?

01:29:32.743 --> 01:29:34.493
It's a legal thing.

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.455
- Ryan?
- Yeah. There's more?

01:29:45.130 --> 01:29:46.714
This is ridiculous.

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:48.841
<i>But, you know, Legal's really starting 
to come hard at me</i>

01:29:48.925 --> 01:29:51.635
<i>on this term "terminate," so...</i>

01:30:30.133 --> 01:30:31.884
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together</i>

01:30:31.968 --> 01:30:35.096
<i>for today's challenge speaker,
Mr. Ryan Bingham.</i>

01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:38.849
Go get them.

01:30:49.319 --> 01:30:52.404
Last year, I flew 350,000 miles.

01:30:54.074 --> 01:30:55.741
The moon is 250.

01:30:58.995 --> 01:31:03.457
I want you to imagine for a second
that you're carrying a backpack.

01:31:03.542 --> 01:31:06.252
I want you to feel the straps
on your shoulders.

01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:08.712
You feel them?

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:14.885
Now I want you to pack it with
all the stuff that you have in your life.

01:31:16.388 --> 01:31:21.225
Start with the little things,
the things on shelves and in drawers.

01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:42.830
Excuse me.

01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:48.252
What the fuck are you doing?

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:50.421
<i>Okay, everyone, just relax.</i>

01:32:15.488 --> 01:32:18.115
- Hey, you gotta sign.
- Thought I did that already.

01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:21.535
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:27.750
Hey, you forgot to give me
your Hertz No.1 Gold Card!

01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:05.412
So, I was in the neighborhood.

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:11.460
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait, wait.

01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:24.390
- <i>Hey, honey, who's at the door?</i>
- It's just somebody who's lost.

01:34:23.366 --> 01:34:24.700
Alex?

01:34:24.784 --> 01:34:27.745
What were you thinking,
showing up at my door like that?

01:34:27.829 --> 01:34:29.997
What do you mean? I...
I wanted to see you.

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:33.000
I didn't know you had a family.
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

01:34:33.084 --> 01:34:34.335
Look, I'm sorry I ruined your evening,

01:34:34.419 --> 01:34:36.670
but, I mean, you could have seriously
screwed things up for me.

01:34:36.755 --> 01:34:40.299
That's my family. 
That's my real life.

01:34:43.428 --> 01:34:45.346
I thought I was a part 
of your real life.

01:34:47.015 --> 01:34:49.141
I thought we signed up
for the same thing.

01:34:51.227 --> 01:34:55.105
Try and help me understand
exactly what it is that you signed up for.

01:34:56.483 --> 01:34:59.485
I thought our relationship
was perfectly clear.

01:34:59.569 --> 01:35:03.447
I mean, you are an escape.

01:35:06.117 --> 01:35:10.162
<i>You're a break from our normal lives.
You're a parenthesis.</i>

01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:15.876
I'm a parenthesis?

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:17.169
I mean...

01:35:18.046 --> 01:35:22.299
What do you want?
Tell me what you want.

01:35:28.306 --> 01:35:30.307
You don't even know what you want.

01:35:33.019 --> 01:35:35.020
<i>I'm a grown-up, okay?</i>

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:39.525
So, if you would like to see me again,
then give me a call.

01:35:41.611 --> 01:35:42.694
Okay?

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:02.089
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, 
we have a special announcement to make.</i>

01:36:02.173 --> 01:36:06.593
Our pilot has just informed me that we
are passing over the city of Dubuque,

01:36:06.678 --> 01:36:09.263
which might not mean much
to most of you,

01:36:09.347 --> 01:36:11.890
but means a lot
to one of our flyers today.

01:36:11.975 --> 01:36:16.854
- Oh, no.
- Because he just hit 10 million miles!

01:36:20.567 --> 01:36:22.109
Congratulations.

01:36:22.193 --> 01:36:25.737
- <i>Such an amazing accomplishment.</i>
- <i>You must be very, very excited.</i>

01:36:26.448 --> 01:36:29.032
- Hi, Captain.
- Captain.

01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:30.826
That seat taken?

01:36:31.786 --> 01:36:33.120
No. No.

01:36:40.336 --> 01:36:42.421
You're the youngest yet to hit 10 mil.

01:36:43.756 --> 01:36:48.844
- Don't know where you found the time.
- Yeah. I don't know.

01:36:50.555 --> 01:36:51.972
Oh, yeah.

01:36:55.101 --> 01:36:56.560
Here you go.

01:36:58.897 --> 01:37:02.733
Seventh card we've made. 
Small club.

01:37:06.196 --> 01:37:08.655
We really appreciate your loyalty.

01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:14.828
You know how many times
I thought about this moment?

01:37:17.207 --> 01:37:20.501
Played out the conversation
that you and I would have right here.

01:37:20.585 --> 01:37:21.877
Really?

01:37:24.923 --> 01:37:26.924
What did you want to say?

01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:33.889
You know, I don't remember.

01:37:36.267 --> 01:37:39.269
That's all right. 
It happens to all of us.

01:37:43.775 --> 01:37:45.776
So, where are you from?

01:37:51.908 --> 01:37:53.492
I'm from here.

01:38:12.136 --> 01:38:13.845
<i>Hello, Mr. Bingham.</i>

01:38:15.181 --> 01:38:18.308
- How did you know it was me?
- <i>This is your dedicated line.</i>

01:38:18.393 --> 01:38:21.728
<i>We reserve them for our most loyal
and appreciated flyers.</i>

01:38:21.813 --> 01:38:23.605
I'd like to transfer some of my miles.

01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:26.858
Can I open up an account
to Jim and Julie Miller?

01:38:27.485 --> 01:38:29.945
<i>Certainly. How many miles
would you like to transfer?</i>

01:38:30.029 --> 01:38:32.698
How many miles does it take
to circle the globe?

01:38:32.782 --> 01:38:36.910
<i>We have our round-the-world tickets.
They're 500,000 miles each.</i>

01:38:36.995 --> 01:38:38.662
- That'd be fine.
- Got a second?

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:40.038
I'll call you back.

01:38:40.123 --> 01:38:41.164
What the hell happened to you yesterday?

01:38:41.249 --> 01:38:42.916
I was trying to get hold of you all day.

01:38:43.001 --> 01:38:46.420
I was... Some personal stuff.
What's going on?

01:38:46.504 --> 01:38:48.797
Do you remember Karen Barnes,

01:38:49.799 --> 01:38:53.385
part of a 30-person reduction
a few weeks back in Wichita?

01:38:53.469 --> 01:38:55.220
Natalie fired her.

01:38:55.805 --> 01:38:58.015
I fire dozens of people a day. I...

01:38:58.099 --> 01:39:00.851
She killed herself, jumped off a bridge.

01:39:02.895 --> 01:39:04.104
Fuck.

01:39:04.564 --> 01:39:06.064
I need to know

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:10.110
if you remember any woman
that gave you any signals, depression...

01:39:10.194 --> 01:39:11.778
They're all depressed.
We're firing them.

01:39:11.863 --> 01:39:14.698
Hey, I need to ask you this stuff, okay?

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:18.869
No, I don't remember anything.
You never think that they're...

01:39:21.497 --> 01:39:23.206
You don't remember any woman
that gave you any signals?

01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:26.543
- Anything at all, Ryan?
- No, nothing stands out.

01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:32.966
- Natalie all right?
- Natalie quit.

01:39:37.221 --> 01:39:40.057
- She quit?
- Text message.

01:39:41.768 --> 01:39:44.645
Yeah, fucking nice, right?
No one's got any manners anymore.

01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:49.399
- She say where she was going?
- No. She was a little upset.

01:39:51.778 --> 01:39:53.904
I should give her a call.

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:59.159
I need you back in the air.

01:40:02.747 --> 01:40:06.249
Hey, did you hear what I said?
I thought you'd be thrilled about that.

01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:08.877
It's fine.
What about the videoconferencing?

01:40:08.961 --> 01:40:12.631
CTC is going to pause
the new-media front.

01:40:12.715 --> 01:40:15.133
They're gonna give it
some more thought.

01:40:15.218 --> 01:40:17.135
We are gonna get our workhorses 
back in the air,

01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:19.554
doing what they do best, okay?

01:40:20.973 --> 01:40:25.143
- How long are you sending me out?
- We're gonna let you sail and sail.

01:40:25.228 --> 01:40:28.230
You send us a postcard
if you ever get there.

01:40:42.286 --> 01:40:44.287
So, what happened?

01:40:45.915 --> 01:40:49.876
- How exactly do you mean?
- You graduated top of your class.

01:40:50.503 --> 01:40:53.213
You seemed to have your pick of employment, 
including right here.

01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:56.717
Instead you went to Omaha
to fire people for a living?

01:40:58.803 --> 01:41:01.096
- It's challenging work.
- I'll say.

01:41:02.265 --> 01:41:05.225
I can't imagine doing that 
day in, day out.

01:41:05.309 --> 01:41:07.060
Not in this climate.

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:11.148
I followed a boy.

01:41:15.486 --> 01:41:18.155
Well, I guess everybody does that
at one point or another.

01:41:24.495 --> 01:41:26.538
This guy says I'd be lucky to have you.

01:41:26.998 --> 01:41:29.124
<i>To whom it may concern,</i>

01:41:29.208 --> 01:41:32.419
<i>I can't even count the number of people
I've fired in my lifetime.</i>

01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:36.339
<i>So many that I've actually forgotten
what it's like to hire somebody.</i>

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:40.385
<i>We've never met, but I know
you'd be lucky to have Natalie Keener.</i>

01:41:41.262 --> 01:41:44.181
<i>My advice?
Take her and don't look back.</i>

01:41:44.265 --> 01:41:47.142
<i>She'll be the best decision
you've made in a long time.</i>

01:41:51.689 --> 01:41:53.648
I sure hope he's right.

01:42:05.036 --> 01:42:07.120
<i>Well, I don't have a lot of hope,</i>

01:42:07.205 --> 01:42:09.956
<i>and I really don't know
when it's gonna get better.</i>

01:42:10.041 --> 01:42:12.793
There's a lot of people unemployed,

01:42:12.877 --> 01:42:17.005
and I really don't know when there's 
gonna be light at the end of the tunnel.

01:42:17.548 --> 01:42:19.800
I can't find much to talk about.

01:42:19.884 --> 01:42:22.219
Talk about being proud.
I'm proud of my kids.

01:42:22.303 --> 01:42:27.766
I think the anger comes from the fact
that I just wasn't needed anymore.

01:42:27.850 --> 01:42:29.768
I would say, you know,

01:42:30.478 --> 01:42:34.564
without my friends and my family,
I wouldn't have made it.

01:42:34.649 --> 01:42:37.442
It would have been a lot tougher 
if I would have had to make it on my own.

01:42:37.527 --> 01:42:41.530
When I wake up in the morning
and I look over and I see my wife,

01:42:43.032 --> 01:42:44.574
that gives me the sense of purpose.

01:42:44.659 --> 01:42:47.786
It's not all about the money.
Money can keep you warm.

01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:51.248
It pays your heating bills, you know.
It can buy you a blanket.

01:42:52.792 --> 01:42:56.837
But it's not as... Doesn't keep you 
as warm as when my husband holds me.

01:42:57.588 --> 01:43:01.258
Let me get up. Let me get out.
Let me find something.

01:43:02.927 --> 01:43:06.054
So, my kids are my purpose, my family.

01:43:36.168 --> 01:43:38.211
<i>Tonight most people
will be welcomed home</i>

01:43:38.296 --> 01:43:40.797
<i>by jumping dogs and squealing kids.</i>

01:43:41.966 --> 01:43:45.844
<i>Their spouses will ask about their day,
and tonight they'll sleep.</i>

01:43:46.846 --> 01:43:50.640
<i>The stars will wheel forth
from their daytime hiding places.</i>

01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:55.979
<i>And one of those lights,
slightly brighter than the rest,</i>

01:43:56.063 --> 01:43:58.481
<i>will be my wingtip passing over.</i>

01:46:09.405 --> 01:46:11.364
<i>Hi, Jason. 
My name is Kevin,</i>

01:46:11.449 --> 01:46:13.825
<i>and I recently lost my job.</i>

01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:19.748
<i>I wrote this song as sort of
a statement about uncertainty</i>

01:46:19.832 --> 01:46:23.376
<i>and having a certain amount 
of anxiety about the future.</i>

01:46:24.962 --> 01:46:27.630
<i>So, maybe you can use it in your movie.</i>
