00:01.210 --> 00:02.501
Gordon:<i> Previously</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

00:02.503 --> 00:06.505
Go! Today's challenge,
a next-level steak dinner.

00:06.549 --> 00:10.050
Two of you will be sent
into a head-to-head battle

00:10.094 --> 00:12.052
to determine who's going home.

00:12.096 --> 00:14.555
The winning dish--
the chicken.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.640
Congratulations, amber.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.642
I have got to level up.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.394
<i> Tonight...</i>

00:20.396 --> 00:24.356
Your main challenge for today
is devoted to Italy!

00:24.400 --> 00:27.151
I make money with meatballs.
I'm in this to win it.

00:27.194 --> 00:29.111
I grabbed the lobster!

00:29.155 --> 00:31.697
I have never cooked
a live lobster.

00:31.741 --> 00:34.158
- What's wrong with me?
- Let's go!

00:34.201 --> 00:35.367
The competition's
gone up a level.

00:35.411 --> 00:36.952
I did not come to play today.

00:36.996 --> 00:39.288
- I'm making rookie mistakes.
- Oh, my god.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.373
- Come on.
- Jonathan is a hot mess.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.292
We have to completely
start over. ( bleep )

00:43.335 --> 00:45.294
I could be
in the bottom two today.

01:07.193 --> 01:09.193
Gordon:
Line up please.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.278
Oh, boy.

01:12.615 --> 01:15.115
Welcome back. We good?

01:15.159 --> 01:16.825
- All: Yes, chef.
- Glad to hear it.

01:16.869 --> 01:20.621
Team nyesha,
you guys are looking real
confident over there.

01:20.664 --> 01:21.997
Good job.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.457
- Team blais?
- All: Yes, chef?

01:23.501 --> 01:24.875
- We're down a chef.
- We are.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.076
- Yes.
- Correct, yeah.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.462
What are we gonna do to keep
ourselves safe this week?

01:28.506 --> 01:30.422
- We're gonna be focused.
- Yes, focused.

01:30.466 --> 01:32.257
Team ramsay, we're five strong.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.593
Whatever floor you end up on,
stay that way.

01:34.637 --> 01:36.386
We all locked in.
We're ready to roll.

01:36.430 --> 01:41.141
And after
that last challenge, amber,

01:41.143 --> 01:45.270
you had to face that dreaded
elimination cook-off.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.231
How nerve-wracking was that?

01:47.274 --> 01:48.440
I would say I am disinclined

01:48.484 --> 01:51.110
to put myself there again
any time soon.

01:51.112 --> 01:52.820
Part of me
is a little shaken up

01:52.822 --> 01:55.781
because I came this close
to being the first person to go.

01:55.825 --> 01:58.242
<i> But I wouldn't be here</i>
<i> if I couldn't win this.</i>

01:58.244 --> 02:02.371
We told you all from the
beginning that the competition
would only get harder.

02:02.414 --> 02:03.997
Listen up.

02:04.041 --> 02:07.668
Your main challenge for today
is not based on an ingredient.

02:07.670 --> 02:12.339
Instead, it's devoted
to an entire cuisine...

02:12.383 --> 02:16.552
- Oh.
- ...From a country
with a long history

02:16.595 --> 02:18.178
of culinary excellence.

02:18.180 --> 02:20.764
Oh, gosh. France.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.641
Italy!

02:22.726 --> 02:23.809
- Oh!
- What?

02:23.853 --> 02:25.769
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, wow.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.105
This is a cuisine
that I'm actually quite
comfortable with.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.648
I cook a lot
of italian dishes at home.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.441
<i> Pizza, pastas.</i>

02:31.443 --> 02:34.069
I really wanna
impress the judges
so I'm safe from elimination.

02:34.113 --> 02:35.571
The chef who creates
the best dish

02:35.573 --> 02:39.324
will keep their teams safe
from the elimination cook-off.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.327
And two of you will go into
a head-to-head battle

02:42.329 --> 02:46.456
to determine who will leave
this competition for good.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.460
Let's find out
where you're cooking today.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.088
Team ramsay, do you wanna be
in the basement?

02:53.132 --> 02:55.299
- We ready. We ready.
- We're ready.

02:55.301 --> 03:00.137
- The middle would
be preferable.
- Appreciate the honesty.

03:00.139 --> 03:01.638
Tricia:
<i> I'm a little scared</i>
<i> of the dungeon.</i>

03:01.682 --> 03:03.056
I don't know what's down there.

03:03.058 --> 03:06.101
People make it sound
like hell on earth.

03:06.103 --> 03:07.019
It's evil.

03:07.271 --> 03:10.397
Team trailblaisers,
head to the elevator

03:10.441 --> 03:13.775
and grab a keycard that will
randomly assign you to a floor.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.485
Be careful.
One of those cards

03:15.529 --> 03:18.947
could land our team
in the bare-bones basement.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.282
- Good luck, guys.
- Good luck.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.493
Bye!

03:27.333 --> 03:29.583
Please open the door!
Please open the door!

03:29.627 --> 03:32.085
I'm ready
for the bougie kitchen.

03:32.129 --> 03:33.629
Uh-oh, wait.
Is it gonna open?

03:33.672 --> 03:36.089
We are fancy!

03:36.133 --> 03:38.217
- ( cheering )
- yes!

03:38.260 --> 03:40.052
I've been in this elevator
twice now,

03:40.054 --> 03:42.763
<i> and both times I've gone</i>
<i> to the bottom level.</i>

03:42.765 --> 03:44.723
So I'm like,
"yo, it's top notch."

03:44.767 --> 03:46.183
we are so fancy.

03:46.227 --> 03:49.228
Top kitchen. Shiny!

03:49.271 --> 03:51.271
Everything, it's beautiful.

03:51.273 --> 03:52.564
<i> The stainless steel,</i>
<i> we've got ricers,</i>

03:52.608 --> 03:54.942
<i> we've got sous vide</i>
<i> machines up here.</i>

03:54.985 --> 03:56.318
Wow! Okay.

03:56.362 --> 03:58.445
<i> I've never cooked in</i>
<i> a kitchen like this before.</i>

03:58.447 --> 03:59.738
If you could just wrap
the whole thing up,

03:59.740 --> 04:01.198
stick a bow on it,
and deliver it?

04:01.242 --> 04:02.699
Yeah, that'd be great.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.952
It's beautiful.

04:04.995 --> 04:08.121
- Please, not the dungeon.
- Ooh!

04:08.165 --> 04:09.665
We good, we good, we're good.

04:12.127 --> 04:15.128
It's gonna bring us back down.
It's all right.

04:15.172 --> 04:18.090
Roice:<i> The specific dish</i>
<i> I have in mind going into</i>
<i> this challenge is a pesto.</i>

04:18.133 --> 04:20.050
<i> I'm really hoping</i>
<i> not to get the bottom</i>

04:20.052 --> 04:20.968
because I know
that's going to be

04:21.220 --> 04:23.262
extremely challenging
with a pasta dish,

04:23.305 --> 04:25.138
especially if all
the pasta's taken away.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.224
- It's gonna go.
- Oh! Okay.

04:27.268 --> 04:29.851
- What?
- Yes! I told you!

04:29.895 --> 04:32.980
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I'm not complaining.
It's not the bottom.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.440
- We're not in the dungeon.
- There are peelers!
There are peelers!

04:35.442 --> 04:37.651
There are peelers!
There's a brush!

04:40.030 --> 04:42.239
We've got this no matter what.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.076
- Okay, we can do it.
- It's beautiful.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.287
- It's not that bad.
- It's gorgeous.

04:48.330 --> 04:52.082
Everybody else
in the kitchen is positive,
but it's hell down here.

04:52.084 --> 04:55.502
All right, what do we got to
freaking work with around here?

04:55.504 --> 04:57.754
<i> I can only imagine what's</i>
<i> gonna be left on the platform.</i>

04:57.798 --> 04:59.131
<i> Being on the middle</i>
<i> a couple times,</i>

04:59.383 --> 05:01.466
<i> there wasn't exactly the</i>
<i>greatest spread to choose from,</i>

05:01.552 --> 05:04.511
so it's gonna be a lot harder
to get safety for my team.

05:04.555 --> 05:08.473
That is some raggedy-ass
tools, man. ( bleep )

05:09.727 --> 05:11.143
what's up, guys?

05:11.186 --> 05:12.269
- Hi.
- Hi, chef.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.146
- Chef.
- Let's go. Huddle up.

05:14.189 --> 05:15.522
Huddle up.
Huddle up. Let's go.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.317
- Let's go.
- Let's do it, chef.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.193
- Right, how are we feeling?
- Good, good.

05:20.237 --> 05:22.404
- Determined.
- Second floor, first thoughts?

05:22.448 --> 05:24.740
- Well-equipped.
- Very well-equipped.
Everything's here.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.451
You gotta bring that energy
on those plates.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.661
- Chef blais!
- All right, team, here we go.

05:29.705 --> 05:31.163
We're down a chef today,

05:31.206 --> 05:33.290
so it's very important
that we have the best dish.

05:33.334 --> 05:37.085
<i> Nyesha and gordon</i>
<i> have five chefs on their team.</i>

05:37.129 --> 05:39.296
<i> We definitely want</i>
<i> to go down two chefs.</i>

05:39.298 --> 05:40.589
<i> Everyone's reputation</i>
<i> is on the line,</i>

05:40.632 --> 05:42.049
including my own.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.125
Listen, at this point,
you should be thinking about,

05:44.127 --> 05:45.385
like, what kind of dish
you're gonna make.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.678
We need to have
the best dish here

05:46.722 --> 05:48.638
to win safety for our team.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.016
Let's line up
back on the elevator.

05:51.060 --> 05:53.226
Big bold flavors,
layering flavors.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.186
- All right, let's do this.
- Let's do this.

05:54.229 --> 05:55.604
All: Team nyesha!

05:55.647 --> 05:57.189
Let's go! Big voices!

05:57.232 --> 05:58.315
- Okay, guys.
- It's almost go-time.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.359
Gordon:
When that goes green, stand by.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.527
- Okay, here we go.
- Okay.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.695
It's moving, you guys.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.614
Go!

06:05.657 --> 06:07.324
Oh, my god, oh, my god,
oh, my god, oh, my god.

06:07.326 --> 06:10.369
- Richard: Let's go, team.
- Do we see beets?
Do we see beets?

06:10.412 --> 06:14.039
Roice:<i> I really, really</i>
<i> would love to be able</i>
<i> to stick to the coast.</i>

06:14.041 --> 06:16.041
It's kind of my forte,
and for some reason

06:16.043 --> 06:18.752
I grab the only thing
I've never cooked before,

06:18.754 --> 06:20.087
<i> and that is clams.</i>

06:20.130 --> 06:22.130
( muttering )

06:22.132 --> 06:23.090
do you see beets?

06:23.133 --> 06:24.549
<i> In past challenges,</i>

06:24.593 --> 06:25.926
<i> I haven't been happy</i>

06:25.928 --> 06:27.177
with the ingredients
I selected.

06:27.221 --> 06:30.055
So my focus is
grab the right ingredients.

06:30.099 --> 06:31.515
Grab some flavor! Flavor!

06:31.517 --> 06:32.641
- Oh, my gosh.
- Grab everything
that you can now.

06:32.935 --> 06:36.019
You still got a second.
If you can grab it, it's yours.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.104
Good job.
Way to get down there.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.522
Okay, back to your station.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.649
Courtney:
<i> I think mariah had, like, 14,</i>

06:40.692 --> 06:42.359
<i> 15 ingredients, if not more.</i>

06:42.403 --> 06:43.318
Mariah is a g.

06:43.362 --> 06:45.445
I got some stuff in my pockets.

06:48.492 --> 06:52.160
And let's go!
Grab, grab, grab. Come on.

06:52.204 --> 06:54.704
- Does anyone see pasta dough?
- Grab a proper handful.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.040
- Some watercress. Okay.
Ooh, I need this can.
- Got it.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.166
Devonnie:
<i> Grab things, devonnie.</i>

06:58.210 --> 06:59.167
Ooh, dungeness crab.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.127
<i> I see dungeness crab.</i>

07:00.170 --> 07:01.253
"I'm grabbing it! That's it."

07:01.296 --> 07:03.046
<i> grabbing my dungeness crab.</i>

07:03.090 --> 07:04.589
- Eggs where?
- Eggs right here. Grab them.

07:04.675 --> 07:07.050
- Five, four, three...
- Guys, there's a cheese
over there.

07:07.094 --> 07:10.554
- Where?
- ...Two, one, and stop!

07:10.597 --> 07:14.057
- ( bleep )
- let's go, let's go,
let's go! Well done!

07:14.101 --> 07:17.144
( bleep )
oh, I didn't grab a hero!

07:17.229 --> 07:18.979
You didn't grab a protein?

07:19.022 --> 07:20.730
- ( bleep )
- tricia.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.483
Oh, my goodness me.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.944
I don't have a cheese.
I don't have an egg.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.155
I have pasta dough,
canned tomatoes,

07:28.198 --> 07:30.323
<i> spinach, and a zucchini.</i>

07:30.367 --> 07:31.533
What am I gonna do with that?

07:31.577 --> 07:33.702
Tricia, you got this.
You'll be fine.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.582
Nyesha:
Here we go. Italian!

07:38.625 --> 07:40.208
Go, it's green!

07:41.462 --> 07:43.211
I need cheese, herbs.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.007
Breakfast sausage.

07:47.009 --> 07:48.967
<i> I know I can cook.</i>

07:48.969 --> 07:51.052
I just want great ingredients.

07:51.096 --> 07:52.471
I don't want crap.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.141
Angie's got the lobster.
Let's go.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.561
I don't know
what personality of mine

07:59.605 --> 08:03.023
<i> grabbed</i>
<i> the live fricking lobster,</i>

08:03.108 --> 08:04.608
but she's a jerk.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.984
Pasta, pasta.

08:06.028 --> 08:08.487
Nyesha: Three, two, one!

08:08.530 --> 08:10.363
Time's up, time's up,
time's up. Let's go.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.657
Oh, my god.
I grabbed the lobster.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.284
- What the ( bleep )?
- Yes!

08:14.328 --> 08:16.411
I am incredible surprised
that a live lobster

08:16.455 --> 08:17.370
made it down to the basement.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.581
<i> I would've thought</i>
<i> that it's something</i>

08:19.625 --> 08:21.166
<i> that somebody would take</i>
<i> on the top floor.</i>

08:21.210 --> 08:24.211
I grabbed the lobster!

08:24.254 --> 08:27.088
I have never cooked
a live lobster,

08:27.132 --> 08:30.008
<i> and I have to cook seafood</i>
<i> in the basement.</i>

08:30.052 --> 08:32.177
I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.267
Your 45 minutes starts now!
Let's go! Excellence!

08:39.311 --> 08:41.561
- Heard. Let's go.
- Elevated italian dishes.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.313
- Making money? Let's do it.
- Making money.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.565
All right,
what do I wanna do first?

08:45.567 --> 08:47.359
Angie: Oh, my god,
I grabbed a lobster.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.402
<i> This is a really</i>
<i> great ingredient,</i>

08:49.404 --> 08:52.489
but the only experience
I have with lobster

08:52.533 --> 08:55.158
is previously frozen
lobster tail.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.160
Angie, walk me through
your process.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.120
Well, I grabbed a lobster.

08:59.164 --> 09:01.581
So I can do some great stuff
with this.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.833
Yes, you can.
You got some great ingredients.

09:03.835 --> 09:09.089
I am making sun-dried tomato
béchamel sauce on bowtie pasta.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.341
It may be pedestrian,
but it's delicious,

09:11.385 --> 09:14.177
and I'm gonna set a ( bleep )
lobster on top.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.388
Maybe a little nice breadcrumb
would be beautiful.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.181
- Oh, yes, chef.
- To finish your pasta?

09:18.183 --> 09:20.016
- Oh, yes, chef. Yes, chef.
- Okay, okay, okay.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.393
I got you, I got you.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.937
<i> My name is angie,</i>
<i> I'm from lubbock, texas.</i>

09:23.981 --> 09:26.606
<i> I was a clinic nurse</i>
<i> for 11 years,</i>

09:26.608 --> 09:30.569
<i> but I always dreamed that I</i>
<i> would get to be a chef one day</i>

09:30.612 --> 09:32.487
<i> and really</i>
<i> get to speak to people</i>
<i> through my food.</i>

09:32.531 --> 09:36.157
<i> I'm not classically trained.</i>
<i> I am a home chef.</i>

09:36.201 --> 09:38.243
<i> For the last two years,</i>

09:38.287 --> 09:40.161
<i> I've been catering</i>
<i> and doing what I love.</i>

09:40.205 --> 09:43.290
<i> A big part of me</i>
<i> coming to this competition</i>

09:43.333 --> 09:45.041
<i> is just to show my kids</i>

09:45.043 --> 09:48.253
<i> you can live the life</i>
<i> you were created to live.</i>

09:48.297 --> 09:51.423
<i> I'm gonna squeeze</i>
<i> everything I can</i>

09:51.466 --> 09:53.091
<i> out of being able</i>
<i> to hone my palate</i>

09:53.135 --> 09:55.969
<i> and train under</i>
<i> these phenomenal chefs.</i>

09:57.014 --> 09:58.388
I did not come to play today.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.974
I do not want
any of my chefs going home.

10:01.018 --> 10:02.091
- Never.
- No, chef.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.184
Chef, not today.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.770
We are bringing a-plus
dishes today.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.273
<i> Chef angie is throwing it down</i>
<i> with the lobster.</i>

10:08.317 --> 10:10.233
<i> I'm really excited</i>
<i> about this cook.</i>

10:10.268 --> 10:12.652
The intensity
is definitely here.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.237
Bring it home.

10:14.323 --> 10:17.115
- Something creative
on top of that, yeah?
- Oui, chef.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.533
Gordon:
You're going vegetarian, right?

10:18.577 --> 10:20.785
Yes, I'm trying to see
if I can flex a little bit.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.622
Gordon:
So we're 10 minutes gone.
35 minutes to go.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.790
- Kenny: Roice, you good, baby?
- Doing great.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.251
- Y'all looking good.
- Kenny: Trish, trish,
how you feeling, baby?

10:28.295 --> 10:30.462
- Uh...
- Kenny: You're in your zone?
Stay in your zone.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.757
Check in with each other.
Push each other. Drive, okay?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.133
We came out of the gate strong.

10:35.177 --> 10:37.510
We got a target on our backs.
Let's go.

10:37.554 --> 10:41.181
- Everybody start
shooting out ideas.
- I'm doing a pesto pasta.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.724
No, uh-- no protein?

10:42.726 --> 10:44.059
No, chef. Not with pesto.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.769
But where's your ingredients
for the pesto?

10:45.812 --> 10:50.607
- Right here, chef.
- So, no pine nuts or walnuts?

10:50.651 --> 10:51.775
Oh, ( bleep ).

10:51.818 --> 10:53.360
<i> The freaking pine nuts.</i>

10:53.403 --> 10:55.862
I forgot the pine nuts
for my pesto.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.447
I don't know how you're gonna
make a pesto with no nuts.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.282
- Yes, chef.
- The competition's
gone up a level.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.534
The cooks on that floor and in
the basement are getting good.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.704
I'm gonna use the sesame seeds
and toasted panko just
to get that nutty flavor.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.998
Okay.
Cook it beautifully, yeah?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.669
Roice:<i> By day, I'm a teacher.</i>

11:10.712 --> 11:12.504
<i> By night, I'm a tiktok chef.</i>

11:12.547 --> 11:14.339
It's beef and broccoli.
Let me show you
how to make it my way.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.508
<i> I teach eighth grade science</i>
<i> and I love every bit of it.</i>

11:16.510 --> 11:20.136
<i> The fact that I'm a</i>
<i> science teacher gives me a</i>
<i>huge edge over the competition.</i>

11:20.180 --> 11:22.430
All right, let's do this.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.058
<i> I understand how heat works,</i>
<i> how thermodynamics work,</i>

11:25.102 --> 11:26.976
<i> how starches function</i>
<i> under heat.</i>

11:27.062 --> 11:28.770
The first thing you need
is a dry steak.

11:28.814 --> 11:30.480
This has too much moisture.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.524
<i> If I can inspire people</i>
<i> to understand</i>

11:32.567 --> 11:35.193
<i> that you don't have to go</i>
<i> to culinary school</i>
<i> to be an amazing cook,</i>

11:35.237 --> 11:36.903
<i> then I've done my job.</i>

11:36.947 --> 11:40.156
Gordon ramsay would call me
a freaking doughnut right now.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.119
Careful. Control.
Control, roice. Come on.

11:44.162 --> 11:45.954
This is where this competition
literally takes off,

11:45.997 --> 11:48.415
<i> and three of my cooks</i>
<i> have got not protein,</i>

11:48.458 --> 11:50.041
<i> so if you're gonna make</i>
<i> an italian vegetarian dish,</i>

11:50.085 --> 11:52.377
trust me, tonight
it needs to be perfect.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.921
Just over 26 minutes
to go, guys, yes?

11:54.965 --> 11:57.215
- Oui, chef.
- Let's go.

11:58.093 --> 11:59.342
All right, we gotta push now.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.719
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

12:00.721 --> 12:01.553
Oh, my god.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.012
You have the zoodles
already cut?

12:03.056 --> 12:04.180
Yeah, the zoodles are here.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.348
<i> I have struggled</i>
<i> in this competition,</i>

12:05.684 --> 12:08.893
<i> and from here on out,</i>
<i> I have to rise to the occasion</i>

12:09.020 --> 12:11.312
and exceed
everybody's expectations.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.189
Richard: Courtney,
you're looking outstanding.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.691
I deserve to be here for sure.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.234
Do I need anything else to that?

12:16.278 --> 12:17.402
A little more salt
in the zoodles.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.196
- Just a little more salt? Okay.
- Yeah, a little more salt.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.825
Let's get that team immunity.

12:23.869 --> 12:26.536
I make money with meatballs.
I got this. I got this.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.288
What are you tasting in there?
What's in there?

12:28.290 --> 12:30.665
Some kind of breakfast sausage.
I wanna know what it tastes like

12:30.709 --> 12:33.084
- before I start adding
my spices to it.
- Okay, okay.

12:33.128 --> 12:36.296
So I'm going towards a meatball
with cheese sauce.

12:36.298 --> 12:38.548
What you got?
What you working with, chef?

12:38.592 --> 12:39.799
- I got a pizza dough.
- You got a pizza dough.

12:40.218 --> 12:43.344
- A little marsala,
pancetta, veal, leeks.
- Where are we going?

12:43.388 --> 12:46.347
I'm probably gonna turn this
into some sort of gnocchi.

12:46.391 --> 12:48.516
You're gonna turn a pizza dough
into a gnocchi?

12:48.518 --> 12:50.226
Did you grab potatoes?

12:50.228 --> 12:53.313
No, chef. Yeah, so--
good point, chef.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.190
- You're better than that.
- Yes, chef.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.025
- You're better than that.
- Thank you, chef.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.402
Oh, sweet zachary.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.906
You're never gonna turn
pizza dough into gnocchi.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.159
<i> Gnocchi is 70% cooked potato.</i>

13:06.203 --> 13:08.119
Zach needs to completely rethink

13:08.163 --> 13:10.205
his entire conception
of this dish.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.833
Nice little pizza right there.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.919
You got some garnish to flake
right on top of your anchovies?

13:15.962 --> 13:18.463
I can make something
happen from this.

13:18.507 --> 13:22.300
I'm not a pizza-olio,
I'm pretty freaking close
over here.

13:22.302 --> 13:26.095
<i> I'm zach,</i>
<i> I'm from milwaukee, wisconsin,</i>

13:26.139 --> 13:28.515
<i> and I am professional</i>
<i> line cook.</i>

13:28.558 --> 13:31.601
<i> Growing up,</i>
<i> I didn't really fit into</i>
<i> any social group,</i>

13:31.645 --> 13:33.186
<i> didn't have</i>
<i> any self-discipline,</i>

13:33.188 --> 13:34.562
<i> and I was going down</i>
<i> the wrong path.</i>

13:34.564 --> 13:38.024
<i> But then I found myself</i>
<i> and family in the kitchen.</i>

13:38.068 --> 13:41.319
A real chop going into
the marinara over here.

13:41.363 --> 13:42.779
<i> I'm gonna win</i>
<i> "next level chef"</i>

13:42.823 --> 13:45.281
<i> because I got more heart</i>
<i> than anybody else here.</i>

13:45.283 --> 13:47.617
<i> I want to open up a food truck</i>

13:47.661 --> 13:50.495
<i> and hire at-risk youth</i>
<i> who don't have a career path,</i>

13:50.539 --> 13:53.289
<i> and I'm gonna inspire them</i>
<i> to become great chefs.</i>

13:53.333 --> 13:54.791
Ooh!

13:54.793 --> 13:56.084
Let's do this!

13:57.128 --> 13:59.504
Hey, if we're faced
with a problem,

13:59.548 --> 14:01.214
- let's bounce back, okay?
- Yes, chef.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.924
I'm gonna use the pasta dough,

14:02.968 --> 14:06.302
and then I'm going to stuff them
with homemade ricotta cheese.

14:06.304 --> 14:08.096
- So you're gonna
make ricotta cheese...
- Yes, chef.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.223
- In 45 minutes?
- Yes, chef.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.766
It's just not an easy thing
to do.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.268
Tricia:<i> "are you sure</i>
<i> you can make a ricotta?"</i>

14:13.270 --> 14:16.104
I was pretty sure before
he asked me that question.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.313
I'm not so sure anymore.

14:17.399 --> 14:19.524
Who taught you how to make
ricotta like this?

14:19.568 --> 14:21.317
I practice at home.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.444
<i> I need some type</i>
<i> of creamy element to my dish,</i>

14:23.530 --> 14:26.823
otherwise it's just gonna be
a tomato sauce with squash.

14:26.867 --> 14:30.660
It's gonna suck.
I don't know how to put on
this pasta maker.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.403
Oh, my god.

14:32.414 --> 14:35.039
I can't believe I forgot
to grab a protein, man.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.125
- I'm so ( bleep ).
- It's italian, baby.

14:37.127 --> 14:39.669
You can make magic without
a protein, I promise.

14:39.713 --> 14:40.795
Relax and do your thing.

14:40.797 --> 14:44.132
20 minutes remaining.
20 minutes.

14:44.175 --> 14:45.383
<i> We're on the top floor.</i>

14:45.719 --> 14:49.262
My chefs have a clear vision.
They've got classic dishes.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.388
<i> They got ingredients.</i>

14:50.432 --> 14:53.057
The question is
do they have enough time?

14:53.101 --> 14:54.976
All right, jonathan,
I'm with you now. What's up?

14:54.978 --> 14:57.604
Would you say these need to go
into water with flour
before I cook?

14:57.647 --> 14:59.439
- Water with flour?
- To make them
spit out the sand.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.149
- No, there's no sand in them.
- No? Okay.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.650
- This is "next level chef."
- got it.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.360
Richard:
That's it. Get them going.

15:04.487 --> 15:07.238
I've never worked with clams
before. I've seen it done
a million times.

15:07.282 --> 15:08.489
<i> I've watched gordon do it</i>
<i> a million times.</i>

15:08.533 --> 15:09.616
Whoo!

15:09.910 --> 15:11.784
I'm a little nervous,
but I'm confident for sure.

15:11.786 --> 15:14.954
Oh, there you are.
I found you.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.373
Gordon: All of you,
platform is on its way.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.334
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.169
What goes well
with italian dishes?

15:21.171 --> 15:22.670
- Bread.
- Parmesan.

15:22.714 --> 15:23.922
What's happening right now?

15:23.965 --> 15:25.798
Chef ramsay's like,
"expect surprises."

15:25.842 --> 15:28.301
and I'm like, "okay,
but can't they be good ones?"

15:30.096 --> 15:32.430
oh, my god. You guys,
there's an ingredient coming.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.682
There cannot be
a mystery ingredient.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.559
And it's mushrooms!
Mushrooms!

15:36.603 --> 15:38.061
Mushrooms? Whoo!

15:38.104 --> 15:39.854
Richard:
You got a couple seconds.

15:39.898 --> 15:41.773
You can grab as many
or as many varieties
as you'd like.

15:41.816 --> 15:44.192
Grab what you need.
You gotta incorporate it
into your dish.

15:44.235 --> 15:46.194
The platform drops again,

15:46.237 --> 15:48.738
and thank god
they're mushrooms, okay?

15:48.782 --> 15:50.865
Because I love "umamies."

15:50.909 --> 15:53.117
richard: Three, two, one.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.328
Ae:<i> I'm making</i>
<i> a shrimp capellini.</i>

15:55.372 --> 15:57.830
<i> So, super herb-y,</i>
<i> super fresh ingredients.</i>

15:57.874 --> 16:00.708
I think these mushrooms
will help me elevate
my dish, for sure.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.044
Umami came to my rescue.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.088
- Mushrooms, yes?
- Mushrooms!

16:05.131 --> 16:07.715
10 seconds! Go!
Let's go!

16:07.759 --> 16:10.426
- I'll take it.
- Let me get those
baby creminis.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.262
Devonnie:
<i> I'm making tomato broth</i>
<i> with homemade gnocchi</i>

16:13.264 --> 16:15.390
with a dungeness crab tower
and fried capers.

16:15.433 --> 16:19.102
<i> How am I gonna incorporate</i>
<i>mushrooms into my current dish?</i>

16:19.104 --> 16:20.687
Devonnie, what did you get?
Chestnut mushrooms?

16:20.730 --> 16:22.271
- Oh, chestnut.
- Really good.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.648
- Thank you.
- A touch more oil in there.

16:23.692 --> 16:26.025
Grab as many mushrooms
as you can.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.151
Let's go!
Let's go, guys!

16:27.195 --> 16:28.152
Sergio:<i> This is great.</i>

16:28.196 --> 16:29.195
<i>I already made a mushroom sauce</i>

16:29.489 --> 16:33.032
with a beautiful can
of cream of mushroom soup.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.117
Nyesha:
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.743
Hustle, hustle, hustle!

16:35.787 --> 16:38.121
<i> My biggest goal at this point</i>

16:38.206 --> 16:39.914
<i> is to balance out</i>
<i> that concentrated can taste.</i>

16:40.000 --> 16:41.416
<i> This is gonna be easy.</i>

16:41.584 --> 16:44.460
All I gotta do is slice it up
and add it right into my sauce.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.463
"chantellies,"
anything special about these?

16:47.549 --> 16:49.298
I've never cooked
with those, bro. Sorry.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.718
Me neither. Are they, like,
poisonous or something?

16:53.638 --> 16:55.346
Oh, my god.

16:55.390 --> 16:58.057
I turned off my pasta water
on accident.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.435
Oh, my gosh.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.103
Boil please. Boil please.

17:02.147 --> 17:03.521
Courtney:
<i> Jonathan is a hot mess.</i>

17:03.565 --> 17:06.274
There's just no room
for error right now. None.

17:06.276 --> 17:10.153
- Come on.
- Something smells like
it's burning.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.114
( bleep )

17:13.158 --> 17:14.532
<i> my spaghetti is a mess.</i>

17:14.576 --> 17:17.243
My breadcrumbs are black
as all get out.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.037
<i> We have to</i>
<i> completely start over.</i>

17:19.080 --> 17:19.996
- What's going on over here?
- Burned.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.498
- Is this you?
- Yeah. Burned the breadcrumbs.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.625
I could be
in the bottom two today,
for sure.

17:24.669 --> 17:27.253
<i> Please, sweet baby jesus.</i>

17:31.301 --> 17:34.135
Something smells
like it's burning.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.345
( bleep )

17:36.681 --> 17:38.556
<i> I have completely burnt</i>
<i> these breadcrumbs,</i>

17:38.600 --> 17:40.224
<i> and I've accidentally cut</i>
<i> my pasta water off.</i>

17:40.268 --> 17:41.517
I'm making rookie mistakes.

17:41.519 --> 17:42.643
- Is this you?
- Burned. Yeah.

17:42.645 --> 17:43.978
- Burned what?
- Burned the breadcrumbs.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.563
- Whoo!
- You don't need a lot.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.856
You're making too much food.

17:46.858 --> 17:47.940
I am used to making
a lot of food.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.942
- Done, done, done.
-<i> So I have to start over</i>

17:49.986 --> 17:51.486
and just hope for a miracle.

17:51.488 --> 17:52.945
Keep an eye on that now.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.030
Now we can't make
a mistake, right?

17:54.032 --> 17:55.490
Jonathan: Right.

17:55.492 --> 17:58.117
Jonathan is making
one mistake after the other.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.453
He's putting the whole team's
safety in jeopardy here.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.623
<i> We do not wanna send</i>
<i> another chef into elimination.</i>

18:03.666 --> 18:05.583
Jonathan's gotta
pull it together.

18:07.378 --> 18:08.461
We're just over
12 minutes to go.

18:08.505 --> 18:10.546
- Tricia: Yes, chef!
- 12 to go. Heard.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.007
Gordon: Reuel, great technique.
Who taught you that method?

18:13.051 --> 18:14.884
Online, chef.
University of youtube.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.637
<i> If you're a good competitor,</i>
<i> you push the other person,</i>

18:17.680 --> 18:19.305
and I'm here to push everybody.

18:19.307 --> 18:22.058
<i> I'm making vegetarian</i>
<i> parisian gnocchi.</i>

18:22.102 --> 18:23.267
Just a touch under still.

18:23.603 --> 18:26.771
<i> I wanna show even though</i>
<i> I'm not classically trained,</i>

18:26.815 --> 18:30.191
I've learned little hacks
that culinary school
wouldn't teach you.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.235
- Oui, chef.
- Great job.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.028
Nice, kenny.
Great precision.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.030
- Yes, chef.
- So you go nice
and wide on that...

18:36.074 --> 18:38.491
- Yes, chef.
- ...So it absorbs that sauce
there as well, yes?

18:38.535 --> 18:42.036
- Yes, chef.
- You're not a knife
for hire tonight.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.497
Kenny:<i> I'm kenny</i>
<i> from atlanta, georgia.</i>

18:44.541 --> 18:46.332
<i> Back my home,</i>
<i> I'm a knife for hire.</i>

18:46.334 --> 18:47.959
<i> Any restaurant, they call,</i>

18:48.002 --> 18:49.752
<i> I come and help them out</i>
<i> where needed.</i>

18:49.796 --> 18:51.295
I joined the military
straight out of high school.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.339
<i> Did four years,</i>
<i> three tours to iraq.</i>

18:53.383 --> 18:55.508
<i> Upon leaving the military</i>
<i> in 2008,</i>

18:55.552 --> 18:57.885
<i> I said, "why not try</i>
<i> culinary school?"</i>

18:57.929 --> 19:01.472
so, I joined le cordon bleu and
I've been cooking ever since.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.600
Today I'm a proud father
of four kids,

19:04.644 --> 19:05.685
two boys, two girls.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.019
<i> I'm here for a reason,</i>

19:07.063 --> 19:09.313
<i> and that's to win this money</i>
<i> for my kids.</i>

19:09.315 --> 19:12.233
When I win,
we're going to disney world.

19:14.487 --> 19:18.364
<i>I'm gonna prove to chef ramsay</i>
<i>that I will be next level chef.</i>

19:21.244 --> 19:23.327
Keep it going, guys.
We are the team to beat.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.037
- Yes, chef.
- For sure, for sure.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.039
Downstairs and upstairs,
they want to knock us
down flat, okay?

19:27.083 --> 19:28.666
So get a grip.
Think about this, okay?

19:28.710 --> 19:29.625
- Yes, chef.
- Heard, chef.

19:31.129 --> 19:34.505
It's just with pasta,
you wanna feel like
you're eating something--

19:34.549 --> 19:36.090
- kinda sexy, yeah.
- Yeah, sexy!

19:36.134 --> 19:37.508
- Sexy.
- Sexy food!

19:37.552 --> 19:38.885
I love sexy food.

19:39.262 --> 19:43.055
Sex sells, we all know it.
I'm not giving that
to y'all today.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.558
But what I can do is make you
feel something similar.

19:45.602 --> 19:50.313
<i> I am making a spicy herbed</i>
<i> fusilli pasta.</i>

19:50.356 --> 19:52.023
- Mmm.
- You and I just hit
second base.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.150
Yes, make it sexy!

19:54.152 --> 19:55.484
- Chef angie?
- Yes, chef?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.278
Are you serving it out
of the shell or in the shell?

19:57.322 --> 19:58.863
This? In the shell.
In the shell.

19:58.907 --> 20:01.407
If you're serving the dish
with pasta that I want to eat,

20:01.451 --> 20:03.576
it's gonna be
so hard to get at it,
you know what I mean?

20:03.620 --> 20:05.328
Yes, ma'am. You're correct.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.371
<i> I'm trying to get</i>
<i> my thought process</i>

20:07.415 --> 20:09.081
<i> out of my hometown culture,</i>

20:09.125 --> 20:11.459
and go, "okay, I've gotta
bring this next-level."

20:11.502 --> 20:13.419
why did I do lobster?

20:13.421 --> 20:16.339
Team blais cannot afford
to lose another team member.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.716
No pressure.
How are we doing
on the raviolis?

20:18.801 --> 20:20.051
I just took the lamb out.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.928
Okay, let me see.
It's rare.

20:21.930 --> 20:26.682
I am concerned about the lamb,
and I cook lamb all the time.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.100
All the time.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.101
Aah!

20:29.395 --> 20:31.270
I'm sticking to my guns.
This is what I wanna do.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.231
<i> The other chop is smaller,</i>

20:33.316 --> 20:35.608
so I'm hoping
that it's cooked perfectly.

20:35.610 --> 20:39.487
Three minutes left.
In one minute, we're plating.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.613
Jonathan, I'm worried
about your pasta now.

20:40.657 --> 20:43.115
Yeah, I'm really worried
about my pasta.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.700
Y'all all right?
Y'all all right?

20:45.036 --> 20:46.160
- Start thinking
about your plate, yeah?
- Feeling good, feeling good.

20:46.162 --> 20:47.620
- All good.
- Feeling pretty good.

20:47.664 --> 20:50.623
Let's go, guys.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.041
Dang it.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.168
<i> These ovens</i>
<i> in the basement suck.</i>

20:54.212 --> 20:56.295
I just don't wanna send out
raw freaking pizza dough.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.214
Nyesha:
2 1/2 minutes, guys!

20:58.258 --> 21:00.299
Turn on those turbo engines!

21:00.301 --> 21:02.468
<i> When I go back to check on it,</i>
<i> it doesn't look done.</i>

21:02.553 --> 21:04.387
This is gonna come down
to the wire.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.889
- Nyesha: Start plating!
- All: Yes, chef.

21:06.933 --> 21:10.393
I'm just gonna keep my flatbread
until the absolute last second.

21:13.564 --> 21:17.149
Nyesha: The platform is coming.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

21:17.151 --> 21:18.526
Let's go!
Platform's here.

21:18.569 --> 21:21.195
Platform's here, guys!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

21:21.239 --> 21:23.114
We're on the bottom?
We're on the bottom.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.198
Heard, chef.
Coming right now, chef.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.449
- Zach.
- Five, four...

21:25.827 --> 21:29.161
- Zach. Come on, baby.
- Three, two...
- You got it, dude.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.622
- Yes, sir. Yes!
- ...One. Good job, guys!

21:31.624 --> 21:32.665
You got it, zach.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.083
( trilling )

21:34.127 --> 21:36.419
please let it be cooked.
Please let it be cooked.

21:36.421 --> 21:41.090
Let's go, guys. Let's go.
Devonnie, get on there, girl.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.800
- Five, four...
- Coming out.

21:42.844 --> 21:45.970
- Three, two, one...
- I'm on your back.
I'm on your back.

21:46.014 --> 21:47.221
- ...And go.
- A second to go. A second!

21:47.265 --> 21:50.891
( bleep ), wow. Man!
Well done.

21:50.935 --> 21:54.437
Richard:
The platform is on its way.
Here it is, guys.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.605
You gotta get the food
on the platform!

21:56.649 --> 21:57.732
Come on, y'all.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.317
You only have a couple seconds
to plate!

21:59.360 --> 22:04.030
Three, two, one.
Last looks. There it goes.

22:04.032 --> 22:05.740
- Good job. Way to go.
- Good job!

22:05.783 --> 22:09.201
I'm nervous
because I struggled
in the kitchen today.

22:09.245 --> 22:10.536
I turned that off
and didn't mean to,

22:10.580 --> 22:12.496
and when I dropped my pasta in,
it wasn't boiling.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.291
I know that I made something
that tastes great,

22:15.293 --> 22:18.961
<i> but I just hope that pasta</i>
<i> cooked through.</i>

22:19.005 --> 22:20.671
If not, I may be going
into elimination today.

22:29.265 --> 22:32.600
It's so hard going into
these judging scenarios.

22:32.643 --> 22:36.437
<i> I'm judging the dish based on</i>
<i> the thoughtful intention.</i>

22:36.481 --> 22:39.523
I'm not judging it
based on who made it,
what team they're on.

22:39.567 --> 22:42.526
Just look at these dishes
with that italian influence.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.696
I'm excited to see how everyone
has elevated their dish

22:45.740 --> 22:47.490
with these amazing mushrooms.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.283
Richard, shall we start
with your team?

22:49.327 --> 22:50.743
- Top floor, please.
- Sure.

22:50.787 --> 22:52.536
- Yes. Yes.
- Okay, okay.

22:52.538 --> 22:58.000
This chef has prepared
pan-seared chicken scaloppini,
and in pasta.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.086
Visually it looks beautiful.
Definite restaurant quality.

23:00.129 --> 23:04.256
Really nice transform
something as basic as a squash
and elevate it.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.301
Courtney:
<i> The last cooks didn't pan out</i>
<i> the way I wanted,</i>

23:07.345 --> 23:09.637
so there's definitely
pressure on me

23:09.680 --> 23:12.056
<i> showing the mentors</i>
<i> that I deserve to be here.</i>

23:12.100 --> 23:15.142
Shaking his head. Okay.

23:15.186 --> 23:17.103
- Like, I wanna win.
- Chicken's cooked beautifully.

23:17.146 --> 23:20.231
- Mm-hmm.
- For me, it's lacking
a little bit of salt.

23:20.274 --> 23:21.524
But gorgeous. Gorgeous.

23:21.567 --> 23:22.900
Whoever cooked that,
what a start.

23:24.529 --> 23:29.323
Richard:
The next dish, it's a lamb chop
with one eggplant raviolo.

23:29.367 --> 23:32.034
Oh, god,
please let it be cooked.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.495
- Beautiful.
- Gorgeous.

23:34.497 --> 23:36.080
Oh, gosh.

23:36.124 --> 23:38.416
There's a beautiful balance
of sweetness and gaminess.

23:38.418 --> 23:41.585
But just a touch thinner
on the ravioli.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.880
All right, next up
spicy shrimp capellini.

23:44.924 --> 23:48.759
This chef took the hon shimeji
mushrooms and puréed them
right into the cream sauce.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.138
Gordon:
The shrimp are nailed.
I love the heat there.

23:52.140 --> 23:54.890
It just sort of dances
across my palate.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.518
All right, next dish up here,
spaghetti and clams,

23:57.562 --> 24:01.313
and also toasted breadcrumbs
on top to sort of give
textural contrast.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.732
Please let that
be cooked through, baby.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.985
<i> Being on the top level</i>
<i> with the top ingredients,</i>

24:06.070 --> 24:08.154
<i> there's no excuse for you</i>
<i> not to crank out</i>

24:08.197 --> 24:10.114
some of the best food
you possibly can.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.867
I don't know who cooked this,
but it looks like
it's been cooked by a pro.

24:12.910 --> 24:16.287
What they've managed to do
is cook everything
to absolute utter perfection.

24:16.289 --> 24:19.290
Whew! Father, son,
and kacey musgraves
over here, baby.

24:19.292 --> 24:22.042
I'm just like,
"thank you. Thank you."

24:22.044 --> 24:23.669
definitely from the top floor,
that's for sure.

24:23.713 --> 24:26.505
I'm feeling good
about my team's dishes.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.591
I think everyone stepped
to the plate today.

24:28.634 --> 24:31.343
<i> Hopefully we can find</i>
<i> a winner on this team.</i>

24:31.345 --> 24:33.304
We got four authentically
italian dishes here.

24:33.347 --> 24:36.182
Gordon: Right, shall we move
to the middle floor?

24:36.225 --> 24:39.602
This is one is a hand-rolled
cut pappardelle.

24:39.645 --> 24:42.605
- Wow.
- It's done on a veal chop.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.565
Mushrooms stood out beautifully.

24:44.609 --> 24:47.401
The pasta is definitely a
little thick for a pappardelle,

24:47.445 --> 24:49.111
but the veal
is cooked beautifully.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.198
- Good job, kenny.
- We're here together.

24:52.241 --> 24:55.451
This person wanted to do
a take on a fish stew.

24:55.495 --> 24:58.120
It looks like it
could be served in an upscale
italian restaurant.

24:58.164 --> 25:01.290
The gnocchi's a bit tough
to get behind.

25:01.334 --> 25:05.044
Today, this individual
decided to forgo the protein

25:05.046 --> 25:08.047
and then did
the most amazing gnocchi.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.173
Nyesha: This is exciting.
It looks vibrant.

25:09.467 --> 25:12.551
I'm getting a lot of this umami
and sort of earthiness.

25:12.595 --> 25:14.678
I'm assuming that's coming
from the mushrooms.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.056
That sauce is delicious.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.600
Now this one was a take
on tagliatelle.

25:19.644 --> 25:21.727
No protein, fresh ricotta.

25:23.481 --> 25:26.190
That ricotta is wonderful,
a really nice flavor.

25:26.234 --> 25:29.443
Pasta a little bit overcooked.
It's a bit toothsome.

25:29.487 --> 25:33.113
In an italian challenge,
I overcook my pasta.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.782
<i> Elimination challenge,</i>
<i> here I come.</i>

25:34.825 --> 25:38.536
This was starting out
to make an incredible pesto.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.247
We had no pine nuts,
so this individual

25:41.249 --> 25:43.624
depended on that crunch
from the breadcrumbs.

25:46.003 --> 25:50.297
It's missing ingredients.
It's naked and afraid.

25:50.383 --> 25:53.092
To me, it's underdressed
and mildly uncomfortable.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.177
- Oh, my god.
- If you don't have pine nuts

25:55.263 --> 25:57.388
to make a pesto,
change the plan.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.056
Gordon:
Yes, we're mentoring you,

25:59.100 --> 26:00.432
but understand that
there's two other floors

26:00.476 --> 26:03.018
that are absolutely
on their game.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.186
There are a lot
of good dishes on my team,

26:04.188 --> 26:06.188
<i> but not all of them</i>
<i> were next-level.</i>

26:06.232 --> 26:08.315
<i> There's one floor</i>
<i> left to judge,</i>

26:08.317 --> 26:10.985
<i> and I'm hoping</i>
<i> team ramsay can stay out</i>

26:11.028 --> 26:12.611
<i> of that elimination cook.</i>

26:12.613 --> 26:14.154
Final floor.

26:14.198 --> 26:18.409
Okay, so this chef
created a lobster farfalle

26:18.452 --> 26:20.786
with a focaccia
breadcrumb on top.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.956
Wow. How the frick did a lobster
end up on the basement floor?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.041
- The lobster made it
into the basement.
- I know. I know.

26:26.085 --> 26:29.378
Gordon:
What the hell was going on
those top two floors? Man.

26:30.631 --> 26:34.717
It's lobster. It's either
terrible or glorious.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.679
Gordon:
Whoever cooked this dish,

26:38.723 --> 26:40.514
they know their ( bleep ).

26:40.558 --> 26:44.101
The girl that grabbed
the lobster is not a jerk.

26:44.145 --> 26:45.311
She's a genius.

26:45.313 --> 26:47.938
<i> I just proved myself</i>
<i> in the basement</i>

26:47.982 --> 26:49.523
<i> with a live lobster.</i>

26:49.525 --> 26:50.691
I'm a badass chef.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.486
Okay, we have
a pork meatball here

26:54.530 --> 26:55.988
with a rigatoni.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.699
This person used
cream of mushroom soup

26:58.743 --> 27:00.034
as their sauce base.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.077
Cream of mushroom soup
in a can?

27:02.121 --> 27:04.413
- Wow.
- In a can.

27:04.457 --> 27:07.124
Gordon: If you told me
it was a fresh mushroom sauce,
I would've believed you

27:07.168 --> 27:08.250
because it tastes that good.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.629
Next up,
feta stuffed artichoke

27:11.672 --> 27:16.216
with a whipped mascarpone sauce
over fusilli pasta.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.385
What's going on
with the creativity
in the basement down there?

27:18.429 --> 27:20.763
Those ovens are older
than martha stewart.

27:25.144 --> 27:28.103
- That is good.
- Sort of two dishes
going on here.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.189
Both happen to be tasty,
which is great.

27:31.266 --> 27:35.402
So, this chef
has created a meatball

27:35.446 --> 27:39.323
prepared with breakfast sausage
with crispy squash blossoms.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.450
Richard: Smart choice
of breakfast sausage.

27:41.535 --> 27:44.286
Flavor's there.
Where's the mushrooms?

27:44.330 --> 27:45.579
I'm struggling
to identify the mushrooms.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.457
Last but not least,
we have our first flatbread,

27:48.459 --> 27:50.084
oyster mushrooms
and crispy pancetta,

27:50.127 --> 27:53.337
and it has a marsala sauce
around the outside.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.134
That was a little undercooked.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.969
We can't eat raw flour
like that.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.013
That's just a big no-no.

28:03.099 --> 28:06.558
But I love the pork
and I love the pancetta.

28:07.978 --> 28:09.895
Yes, good effort.

28:09.939 --> 28:11.146
<i> Was my team perfect? No.</i>

28:11.190 --> 28:12.398
<i> There's definitely room</i>
<i> for improvement.</i>

28:12.733 --> 28:16.068
I'm just hoping that we did
enough to survive another round.

28:16.112 --> 28:18.487
<i> I had to put up someone</i>
<i> for elimination last time.</i>

28:18.531 --> 28:21.031
I do not want to be put
in that position again.

28:21.075 --> 28:22.491
Give us a moment, please.

28:22.576 --> 28:27.830
I have to say,
the italian dishes
turned out fantastic!

28:27.873 --> 28:30.958
<i> But even though</i>
<i> we're all mentors</i>
<i> and we all wanna win,</i>

28:31.001 --> 28:33.711
<i> we never play favorites</i>
<i>when it comes to the best dish.</i>

28:33.754 --> 28:36.588
I think what
I'm super excited about
is that clams and spaghetti.

28:36.590 --> 28:39.758
- Richard: I would agree.
- It's incredible,
the flavor and the texture.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.760
So whoever cooked that,
they gave me a taste of Italy.

28:41.804 --> 28:43.220
- Mmm, totally.
- Mm-hmm.

28:43.264 --> 28:45.681
I was very surprised to see
lobster on that platform,

28:45.683 --> 28:47.391
and she did great job
breaking that down.

28:47.435 --> 28:49.518
- Gordon: Lobster was delicious.
- Lobster was delicious.

28:49.562 --> 28:52.730
- Have we decided then?
- Yes. There's no doubt.

28:55.067 --> 29:00.487
Only one of these dishes
truly stood out as being
the best of the best.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.951
The spaghetti and clams.

29:05.995 --> 29:08.120
Yes! Yes! Thank you!

29:08.164 --> 29:10.789
- Thank you.
- ♪ oh, my god

29:10.791 --> 29:12.708
- oh!
- Yes!

29:12.752 --> 29:14.501
Thank you.
Thank you, chefs.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.087
<i> Culinary giants telling you</i>
<i> that you had the best dish</i>

29:17.131 --> 29:20.090
out of 14 people who know
how to cook is so exciting.

29:20.134 --> 29:21.833
Congrats, team trailblaisers.

29:21.844 --> 29:25.387
I am feeling relieved
that I don't have to pick
one of my chefs

29:25.431 --> 29:27.931
<i> to go up into</i>
<i> that pressure cooker</i>
<i> on the third floor.</i>

29:27.975 --> 29:31.852
Unfortunately that means,
gordon and nyesha,

29:31.896 --> 29:35.439
you each have to pick one
of your chefs to battle it out
in the elimination.

29:35.483 --> 29:38.192
I do not like the suspense.
I don't like the waiting.

29:38.194 --> 29:41.153
<i> I wanna stay as far away</i>
<i> from elimination as I can.</i>

29:41.197 --> 29:43.989
Uh, this is hard.

29:44.033 --> 29:48.202
The person I'm sending through
to elimination is...

29:54.960 --> 29:56.084
This is hard.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.587
I'm tied.
I am really tied.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.297
<i> This is a tough choice.</i>

30:00.299 --> 30:02.591
Roice failed yet again to get
the right amount of ingredients

30:02.635 --> 30:04.301
<i> to show how good he is.</i>

30:04.345 --> 30:06.595
<i> But tricia and devonnie</i>
<i> both overcooked their pasta.</i>

30:06.639 --> 30:09.515
<i> I need to have that</i>
<i> next-level chef on my team.</i>

30:09.558 --> 30:13.393
The person I'm sending through
to the elimination is...

30:15.314 --> 30:18.315
Roice.
You're in the elimination,
young man.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.484
Understand the competition.

30:20.528 --> 30:23.278
Sometimes you're just breezing.
You're not giving me your all.

30:23.280 --> 30:26.698
You've got one more chance.
Cook me something that is solid.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.283
I'm not in the business to lose.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.743
- Is that clear?
- Yes, chef.

30:29.787 --> 30:30.953
<i> I am not ready to go home.</i>

30:30.996 --> 30:32.162
I'm going to show chef ramsay

30:32.164 --> 30:33.163
<i> all the skills that I have</i>

30:33.207 --> 30:34.414
and hope that that's enough

30:34.416 --> 30:35.582
to keep me in the competition.

30:35.626 --> 30:36.750
Nyesha?

30:37.962 --> 30:40.087
It's not easy for me.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.421
So I have pyet on one hand,

30:41.465 --> 30:44.299
who completely ignores
the mushrooms,

30:44.301 --> 30:48.053
<i> and I have a dough that</i>
<i> is completely undercooked.</i>

30:48.097 --> 30:49.429
How do you choose between that?

30:49.473 --> 30:53.392
Cooking a great dish,
it doesn't happen by chance.

30:53.435 --> 30:55.519
It comes with a lot
of focus,

30:55.563 --> 30:58.438
integrity, and it's not
just cooking fast.

30:59.525 --> 31:03.277
Zach, we're gonna see you
cook again.

31:04.822 --> 31:07.239
This is not gonna
get you anywhere.

31:07.241 --> 31:08.991
This is just,
"I'm doing the least," right?

31:09.034 --> 31:10.492
- Yes, chef.
- Focus. Intention.

31:10.536 --> 31:14.329
I got a fire in me right now.
It's about to erupt.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.499
Neither of you got the job done
in the first round,

31:17.543 --> 31:20.335
and now both of you will head
into the elimination round.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.171
Roice, zach, you can stay here.

31:23.173 --> 31:24.673
The rest of you,
you can head to the elevator

31:24.675 --> 31:26.049
and we'll meet you
in the kitchen.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.052
- You got this, guys.
- We're gonna have five
people still, okay?

31:29.096 --> 31:31.054
You got it, bud.

31:31.098 --> 31:32.222
Chef nyesha,
I'm sorry I let you down.

31:32.266 --> 31:34.182
<i> I have a lot of pride</i>
<i> as a chef.</i>

31:34.184 --> 31:36.602
I'm ready to redeem myself
and prove why I'm here.

31:36.645 --> 31:37.644
Come on, zach.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.523
You cooked
an italian dish today,

31:41.567 --> 31:45.110
but for tonight's
elimination cook-off,

31:45.154 --> 31:49.281
you'll be creating
a world-inspired noodle dish.

31:50.242 --> 31:53.076
Vietnam, malaysia, singapore,

31:53.078 --> 31:57.122
all host amazing cuisines
with noodles at the heart.

31:57.166 --> 32:01.251
I wanna see you best take
on a noodle dish

32:01.295 --> 32:02.502
from anywhere in the world.

32:02.546 --> 32:06.173
Italian is the only cuisine
you can't cook.

32:06.175 --> 32:08.342
- Is that clear?
- Both: Yes, chef.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.427
The platform will be staying
across the whole 30 minutes,

32:10.471 --> 32:13.555
and on there,
you've got the best
of every ingredient

32:13.599 --> 32:15.182
you could possibly want.

32:15.184 --> 32:18.185
Roice, zach, I'll be with you
for the entire 30 minutes.

32:18.187 --> 32:20.270
This is a blind cook-off.

32:20.272 --> 32:23.148
Gordon and nyesha will not know
who cooked what dish.

32:23.150 --> 32:24.483
Head to the elevator.

32:26.195 --> 32:29.154
Noodles are not my strong point.
I do not make them often at all.

32:29.156 --> 32:33.116
<i> But I know how</i>
<i> to maximize the flavors out of</i>
<i> any dish that I create.</i>

32:33.160 --> 32:35.953
I really just see this as
an opportunity to grow more.

32:35.996 --> 32:39.581
The greatest athletes
that there are, they grow
from their setbacks.

32:41.377 --> 32:43.293
I don't honestly eat
a lot of asian noodles.

32:43.295 --> 32:47.422
<i> I'm feeling nervous,</i>
<i> but I can't let myself</i>
<i> look nervous.</i>

32:47.466 --> 32:51.051
- Thank you, guys.
- Come on, zach.
Let's go, zach.

32:51.095 --> 32:52.761
I have more than enough
to stay in this

32:52.763 --> 32:54.388
<i> "next level chef" competition.</i>

32:54.431 --> 32:56.181
<i> If you thought</i>
<i> I was intense before,</i>

32:56.225 --> 32:57.891
I'm gonna be
a lot more intense
going forward.

32:57.935 --> 33:01.269
As soon as that platform drops,
your 30 minutes will begin.

33:01.271 --> 33:03.480
- Are you ready?
- Yes, chef.

33:05.567 --> 33:09.444
- Whoo!
- Get close, get close,
get close, get close.

33:09.446 --> 33:12.531
Richard:
The best dish of your life,
zach and roice.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.449
Go! It's go-time.

33:14.451 --> 33:17.244
Your 30 minutes starts now.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.288
- Scallions, roice!
- Scallions, roice! Ginger!

33:20.332 --> 33:22.207
- Is this ginger?
- That's galangal!

33:22.251 --> 33:23.458
Take it! Take it!

33:23.460 --> 33:25.168
Roice:<i> I have no clue</i>
<i> what I'm doing.</i>

33:25.212 --> 33:26.920
I know the flavors
that I want to go for...

33:26.964 --> 33:29.840
Chilis, chili oil.

33:29.883 --> 33:32.050
...So I start
grabbing the things that I know
I'm going to need.

33:32.094 --> 33:33.760
Fresh noodles, scallions.

33:33.762 --> 33:35.262
Where are they?

33:35.305 --> 33:36.304
A little faster
with the movement, roice.

33:36.598 --> 33:41.143
All right, so there we go.
Zach moving fastly.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.310
I am in killer instinct mode.

33:42.396 --> 33:45.272
Yes, yes! Yes!

33:45.274 --> 33:48.400
I'm grabbing ground pork,
vermicelli rice noodles,

33:48.444 --> 33:51.528
<i> a bunch of veg to make</i>
<i> my stock taste good,</i>

33:51.572 --> 33:53.030
<i> and any sort of asian</i>
<i> sounding sauce</i>

33:53.073 --> 33:55.907
to give it
the next level on my dish.

33:55.951 --> 33:59.244
You got an area on the globe
of inspiration here?

33:59.246 --> 34:02.164
Yes, asia.
Not any country in particular.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.332
Okay, got it. Got it.
We're going asian influence.

34:04.376 --> 34:07.210
Zach,
there's preserved fish cake.
Put it in your broth.

34:07.254 --> 34:10.130
It's gonna add
some great umami flavors.

34:10.132 --> 34:14.468
To infuse more flavor,
I gotta get my broth going
as soon as possible.

34:14.511 --> 34:17.888
- Thank you!
- There you go. There you go.
There you go.

34:17.931 --> 34:22.059
There's multiple layers.
It's not just stock
with some garlic in it.

34:22.102 --> 34:25.062
- Yes, with the lemongrass!
- All: Yes, yes!

34:25.064 --> 34:28.106
- Yes, yes! The lemongrass!
- You are killing it.

34:28.108 --> 34:29.733
Yes!
He's building those flavors.

34:29.818 --> 34:32.444
- Stay focused though.
Stay focused, okay?
- Yes, chef. Yes, chef.

34:32.488 --> 34:34.780
10 minutes have gone.
20 minutes remain, all right?

34:34.823 --> 34:37.491
Aw, come on.
My hands are shaking.

34:37.534 --> 34:39.326
- It's all right.
- You got this, roice.

34:39.328 --> 34:41.995
- Roice, your
inspiration here is?
- It's thai actually.

34:41.997 --> 34:44.331
Thai. Okay, have you
cooked this dish before?

34:44.374 --> 34:45.957
Never, but the first paycheck
I ever got...

34:46.001 --> 34:48.168
- Got it.
- I took my mom out
to dinner...

34:48.212 --> 34:49.503
- Okay.
- ...And it was a dish
very similar to this.

34:49.588 --> 34:52.130
<i> I'm going to make this dish</i>
<i> that my mom loves.</i>

34:52.174 --> 34:53.882
It's gonna be sweet,
spicy, salty,

34:53.884 --> 34:54.966
<i> and have just a little bit</i>
<i> of acidity in there.</i>

34:55.302 --> 34:58.386
You're using some fresh
fat rice noodles, all right.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.348
- Yes, chef.
- What's gonna be the protein?
It's gonna be just shrimp?

35:01.350 --> 35:03.433
Just gonna be just shrimp
for the protein, yes.

35:03.519 --> 35:06.061
Okay, and then that sauce,
what are you gonna do
with the shrimp shells?

35:06.063 --> 35:08.271
It's gonna be in the oil
that I stir fry in.

35:08.315 --> 35:10.107
My spot here in the competition
is at stake,

35:10.150 --> 35:11.942
<i> so I have to make</i>
<i> a phenomenal dish.</i>

35:11.985 --> 35:14.569
You want flavor here.
You gotta get those
shrimp shells developing.

35:14.613 --> 35:17.948
- Yes.
- You gotta be quick.
13 minutes.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.991
Soy sauce? Hoisin, hoisin.

35:20.035 --> 35:23.328
Hoisin? Yes, yes.
Mix that in there, 100%.

35:23.330 --> 35:26.081
We have roice and zach
throwing down

35:26.125 --> 35:29.668
in a global-inspired
noodle dish challenge.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.294
<i> This one's gonna be tough.</i>

35:31.338 --> 35:33.213
<i> It's gonna come down</i>
<i> to punchy flavors,</i>

35:33.257 --> 35:34.923
maybe a little bit
of authenticity,

35:34.967 --> 35:36.133
but it's anybody's game.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.885
Remember to taste your dishes
as you go, guys.

35:38.929 --> 35:42.139
Nine minutes left. Keep that
flavor in that pan, all right?

35:42.182 --> 35:44.307
Yes, chef.
Time is running out.

35:44.351 --> 35:46.143
- Reuel:
Yo, take that shrimp out.
- Yeah.

35:46.186 --> 35:48.311
Start your other stuff.
Let's go!

35:48.355 --> 35:51.148
When I cook,
I do it for pleasure.
I enjoy it. I go slowly.

35:51.191 --> 35:52.566
<i> And to be in a scenario</i>
<i> like this</i>

35:53.026 --> 35:55.986
where you just have
to go quick, quick, quick,
I'm not used to that.

35:56.029 --> 35:58.780
6 1/2 minutes.
Not a lot of time.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.490
I need garlic.

36:00.534 --> 36:02.909
Where the ( bleep ) did
my garlic go?

36:02.953 --> 36:06.329
- Roice? Move with
a sense of urgency.
- Yeah?

36:06.373 --> 36:09.166
- Move that ass.
- Reuel's telling me
to move my ass.

36:09.168 --> 36:11.418
This is the fastest I've ever
moved my ass in the kitchen.

36:11.461 --> 36:13.003
- Toss it.
- Huh?

36:13.046 --> 36:14.045
You're gonna break the noodles.

36:14.089 --> 36:16.089
- Come on!
- Come on?

36:16.133 --> 36:17.549
Roice, let's go!

36:17.551 --> 36:19.634
<i> As I'm watching</i>
<i> the elimination challenge,</i>

36:19.678 --> 36:21.052
my heart is in my stomach.

36:21.096 --> 36:23.013
All right, big flavor in here.

36:23.056 --> 36:24.181
- You're burning
your sesame seeds.
- Oh, ( bleep ).

36:24.224 --> 36:25.599
Richard: You're burning
your sesame seeds.

36:25.601 --> 36:29.853
I could see, like,
the panic was setting in.

36:29.897 --> 36:33.023
- Roy, we're not going home.
-  <i>I don't know if I can do </i>
<i> this.</i>

36:33.066 --> 36:34.608
This is another level
of anxiety.

36:34.651 --> 36:37.152
- Roice!
- Roice!
- Think about your time.

36:37.154 --> 36:38.528
You gotta be quick
at this point.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.530
- Tricia: Keep cooking.
- I mean, come on.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.287
You're burning
your sesame seeds.

36:47.331 --> 36:49.206
- Oh, ( bleep ).
- You're burning
your sesame seeds.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.458
- He burnt them?
- Richard: 6 1/2 minutes!

36:51.501 --> 36:55.086
- Not a lot of time.
- Roice! Roice!

36:55.130 --> 36:57.464
Roice! Sense of urgency.
Move that ass.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.591
If you're sleeping,
wakey-wakey.

36:59.635 --> 37:01.968
Listen, everyone,
I love that you're helping.

37:02.012 --> 37:03.261
You gotta let him cook
a little bit.

37:03.305 --> 37:06.348
- Yes, yes. For sure.
- Thank you.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.975
- I know I can cook.
- Yes! Let's go, let's go!

37:09.019 --> 37:12.062
<i> I can't just let</i>
<i> my stress and my anxiousness</i>
<i> get the best of me.</i>

37:12.105 --> 37:14.731
- I can do this. I got this.
- You're doing great. Yes!

37:14.775 --> 37:17.525
- Trust yourself, roice.
- Oh, I do.

37:17.527 --> 37:21.529
5:25. How does it feel?

37:21.573 --> 37:23.240
It's almost there, chef.
I just need a little more broth.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.243
My broth is reduced,
and it's tasting awesome.

37:26.286 --> 37:28.161
Is it a broth or does
he have soup? I don't know.

37:28.163 --> 37:30.121
No more!
It's gonna get soggy!

37:30.165 --> 37:31.498
My pork is nice and spicy.

37:31.541 --> 37:34.292
We're rocking.
It's all coming together.

37:34.294 --> 37:36.253
Final minutes!
60 seconds!

37:36.255 --> 37:37.879
Let's go!
Go, go, go, go.

37:37.881 --> 37:39.756
- It smells good.
- Thank you, chef.

37:39.800 --> 37:43.510
Good job, zach!
He's not playing.

37:43.553 --> 37:48.014
Taste, elegance, beauty.
Last looks.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.183
- 30 seconds left.
- Roice, you're doing great.

37:50.227 --> 37:51.268
- That looks good.
That looks good.
- Thank you.

37:51.270 --> 37:54.104
- Beautiful.
- Jalapeno and lime.

37:54.147 --> 37:57.482
Richard: Ten, nine, eight,

37:57.526 --> 37:58.650
seven, six...

37:58.694 --> 38:00.026
It's spicy. It's good.

38:00.070 --> 38:04.030
...Four, three, two, one.

38:04.116 --> 38:05.740
Stop cooking. Wow.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.033
Good job, guys.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.576
You did phenomenal, my dude.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.495
You did phenomenal.

38:15.335 --> 38:16.293
- Hello, chef.
- Chef.

38:16.336 --> 38:17.419
Welcome.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.045
I do not want to send
zach home today,

38:19.047 --> 38:20.672
<i> but I literally have zero idea</i>

38:20.716 --> 38:21.756
<i> on who cooked both dishes,</i>

38:21.800 --> 38:23.466
<i> so I'm basing my decision</i>

38:23.510 --> 38:25.510
<i> purely off of flavor</i>

38:25.554 --> 38:28.972
and which dish I wanna go in
for a next bite on.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.598
Our judges have no idea
who cooked what,

38:30.642 --> 38:32.142
so don't give anything away,

38:32.144 --> 38:33.476
and if there's a tie,
I'll be the one to break it.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.394
All: Yes, chef.

38:34.730 --> 38:37.314
Gordon and nyesha,
here are our two dishes.

38:37.357 --> 38:41.318
Right over here we have
a spicy pork, peanuts,

38:41.320 --> 38:44.029
and chili
with rice vermicelli.

38:44.114 --> 38:48.908
And here we have thai inspired
shrimp and chili

38:48.994 --> 38:51.453
with a wide rice noodle.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.163
Shall we start
with the thai shrimp dish?

38:53.206 --> 38:55.165
Nyesha: Let's do it.

38:55.208 --> 38:57.292
Roice:<i> I know my dish</i>
<i> tastes amazing.</i>

38:57.294 --> 38:59.461
<i> As a kid,</i>
<i> not even as an adult,</i>

38:59.463 --> 39:02.130
I never thought I would ever get
to cook alongside chef ramsay,

39:02.174 --> 39:04.299
<i> and I'm really hoping</i>
<i> to stay in this competition</i>

39:04.301 --> 39:05.383
so that I can
keep learning from him.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.844
I like the flavor
of those noodles.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.137
It's leaning towards
a pad thai.

39:09.181 --> 39:11.264
I think the shrimp
has got a great sear.

39:11.266 --> 39:14.184
Shrimp is slightly overcooked
for me on this dish.

39:14.227 --> 39:16.686
- 30 seconds less cooking
on those noodles?
- Yeah.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.022
That stops it from becoming
a little bit more gummy.
They don't break up.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.733
- However, the flavor's good.
- Yes.

39:23.362 --> 39:27.155
- Shall we?
- Richard, the protein in
this one again, please?

39:27.199 --> 39:30.617
This is pork, peanuts,
black vinegar.

39:30.619 --> 39:32.327
Please be overcooked.

39:32.371 --> 39:34.788
Zach:
<i> I'm confident in my dish.</i>

39:34.831 --> 39:36.790
I turned around my life through
working hard in the kitchen.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.208
<i> I don't want to go home.</i>

39:38.251 --> 39:40.460
<i> I wanna make everybody proud</i>
<i> who believes in me.</i>

39:40.504 --> 39:42.587
Redemption, it was kind of like
the story of my life.

39:42.631 --> 39:44.297
I love the level of spice.

39:44.299 --> 39:47.342
There's a beautiful sort of
rich sweetness.

39:47.427 --> 39:50.887
The secret behind
these dishes is dousing
the noodles in sauce.

39:50.931 --> 39:54.557
Pork is good, but
when you have that amount
of noodles in a bowl,

39:54.601 --> 39:55.767
you're underselling it.

39:55.769 --> 39:57.394
It needs more pork.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.982
Which dish is your winner?

40:03.026 --> 40:05.402
Flavor overall, right?

40:05.445 --> 40:08.571
Journey,
elements of excitement...

40:09.699 --> 40:11.199
I'm going with the pork dish.

40:13.495 --> 40:15.161
My heart's gonna take me

40:15.205 --> 40:17.372
to the one I'd recognize
instantly on a menu...

40:17.416 --> 40:19.124
My big worry
is I'm gonna send
my own person home,

40:19.167 --> 40:20.625
because they're
two good dishes.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.296
...And that would be
the glass noodle
with the shrimp.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.427
That means you've left it to me
to break the tie.

40:30.470 --> 40:33.430
<i> Even though zach and roice</i>
<i> are not on my team,</i>

40:33.473 --> 40:35.098
I don't want
to send anyone home.

40:35.142 --> 40:36.641
I don't wanna be the villain,

40:36.685 --> 40:38.017
but it all comes down to me.

40:38.061 --> 40:39.310
<i> Tough decision.</i>

40:39.354 --> 40:42.272
<i> We are looking for</i>
<i> the one next level chef,</i>

40:42.315 --> 40:44.023
but the only thing
I'm going on here

40:44.025 --> 40:46.234
is flavor, authenticity.

40:46.278 --> 40:47.610
That's all that this is about.

40:47.612 --> 40:53.158
One brought more flavor
to the game than the other.

40:53.201 --> 40:55.368
Zach:
<i> I kind of feel like one</i>
<i> of those old cartoons</i>

40:55.412 --> 40:57.078
where the heart is,
like, thumping.

40:57.122 --> 40:58.955
<i> I'm extremely nervous.</i>

40:58.999 --> 41:01.666
For me, the dish that won...

41:09.217 --> 41:11.468
It's the pork stir fry noodle...

41:11.470 --> 41:12.552
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

41:12.596 --> 41:14.679
...That was cooked by zach.

41:16.224 --> 41:20.393
- Ahh!
- So proud of you.
You left it all out there.

41:20.437 --> 41:22.854
I wanna jump through the roof
with joy and excitement.

41:22.898 --> 41:26.774
I can only jump, like,
two inches off the ground,
but I do my best.

41:26.818 --> 41:30.612
Roice, unfortunately
that means you will not be
the next level chef.

41:32.616 --> 41:33.656
Thank you, chef.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.158
( bleep )

41:35.202 --> 41:36.242
this is a tough choice.

41:36.244 --> 41:38.161
<i> Roice was a creative chef,</i>

41:38.163 --> 41:40.079
<i> and although</i>
<i> he sometimes lacked vision,</i>

41:40.123 --> 41:41.956
<i> he never lacked heart.</i>

41:42.000 --> 41:44.042
<i> Team ramsay, honestly,</i>
<i> has taken a hit.</i>

41:44.044 --> 41:46.044
I'm pissed that you're going,

41:46.046 --> 41:49.923
but this just means
we'll have to work even harder

41:49.966 --> 41:53.051
to make sure we always win
the next-level dish.

41:53.094 --> 41:56.179
You've got a level of pride,
and that's refreshing.

41:56.264 --> 41:57.430
Continue that dream.
Promise me.

41:57.474 --> 41:58.264
Yes, chef, I promise.

41:58.517 --> 42:01.518
Yeah?
Please had to the elevator.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.186
Bye, guys.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.313
<i> I'm disappointed.</i>
<i> I know I could've done more,</i>

42:05.315 --> 42:07.357
but I never thought
I'd ever meet gordon ramsay,

42:07.400 --> 42:09.192
and I got the opportunity
to do that.

42:09.194 --> 42:10.443
<i> He's my childhood hero.</i>

42:10.487 --> 42:12.403
Let's say michael jordan
has a team of five,

42:12.447 --> 42:14.155
and, yeah,
he kicks you off first,

42:14.199 --> 42:15.698
you still got to play
with michael jordan.

42:17.285 --> 42:19.994
You've all seen how difficult
these eliminations are.

42:20.038 --> 42:22.247
There's no rehearsals.
This is the real deal.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.707
Come out of the gate,
play to your strengths.

42:24.709 --> 42:26.960
Every week we climb.
Every week we get stronger.
Is that clear?

42:27.003 --> 42:29.128
- All: Yes, chef.
- Good night.

42:29.130 --> 42:31.756
- Good night.
- Whoo!

42:31.800 --> 42:35.593
I never get anxiety,
but I had anxiety for you, man.
Good job.

42:37.514 --> 42:39.305
Gordon:<i> Next time</i>
<i> on "next level chef"...</i>

42:39.349 --> 42:42.225
We have chosen
the perfect ingredient

42:42.260 --> 42:44.227
for today's challenge--
poultry.

42:44.271 --> 42:48.398
The other kitchens
have already grabbed anything
that I could possibly use.

42:48.400 --> 42:49.983
I don't even know what I have.

42:50.026 --> 42:52.151
This is the worst case
scenario right now.

42:52.195 --> 42:54.028
Stop what you're doing.
Check your pigeon.

42:54.030 --> 42:56.322
I need to believe in myself
a lot more.

42:56.366 --> 42:59.033
You overcook poultry
and you are done-zo.

42:59.077 --> 43:02.370
- Gordon: Dry as a bone.
- I'm worried I may be going
into elimination today.

43:02.414 --> 43:05.039
Mariah: That is a huge mistake.
It could send me home.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.958
What are you trying to do,
kill me?
