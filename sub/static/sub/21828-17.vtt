WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.917
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech-X4...

00:05.000 --> 00:06.750
We destroyed Traeger! Guys, it's over!

00:06.834 --> 00:08.500
(both laughing)

00:08.583 --> 00:09.792
(growling)

00:15.166 --> 00:17.333
Aaagh! Aagh!

00:17.417 --> 00:18.792
Aaaah!

00:20.417 --> 00:21.917
Take me to Traeger.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.333
What did I do?

00:23.417 --> 00:27.542
(Traeger) The residual ooze in your brain
is in control over you.

00:27.625 --> 00:29.834
-(growling)
-(Traeger) Destroy them as I heal,

00:29.917 --> 00:31.917
and exact my revenge.

00:33.041 --> 00:34.125
(growling)

00:38.458 --> 00:40.625
-What do we do now?
-We get our friend back.

00:40.709 --> 00:42.667
And we make Traeger pay.

00:52.375 --> 00:53.709
(metal thuds)

01:01.458 --> 01:02.750
(groaning)

01:18.166 --> 01:20.709
(grunting)

01:25.208 --> 01:27.709
Yes. That's better.

01:28.542 --> 01:30.125
I wasn't sure this would work.

01:30.667 --> 01:33.917
But it will be some time
before I'm back at full strength.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.166
I don't understand.
Why can't you just heal yourself?

01:37.250 --> 01:40.959
Because I am a combination
of gel and human DNA.

01:41.041 --> 01:46.208
I needed an infusion of genetic material
from the original source.

01:46.291 --> 01:49.417
Then, we don't need
this guy anymore, right?

01:55.125 --> 01:57.834
(high-pitched buzzing)

02:00.500 --> 02:04.208
(groaning in pain)

02:05.667 --> 02:09.083
(theme music playing)

02:44.750 --> 02:46.208
(whirring)

02:46.291 --> 02:47.500
(Veracity) Easy there, Ryan.

02:48.417 --> 02:50.875
Yeah. Little to the right.

02:50.959 --> 02:52.500
You sure he's out?

02:53.166 --> 02:55.000
If he wakes up, he'll waste us.

02:55.083 --> 02:57.125
Trust me.
He is so pumped full of sedatives

02:57.208 --> 02:58.333
that nothing'll wake him.

02:58.417 --> 02:59.583
Just stay in the zone.

02:59.667 --> 03:00.917
Try not to think about the fact

03:01.000 --> 03:03.750
that you're basically
performing brain surgery on your friend.

03:03.834 --> 03:06.709
Just completely remove
that thought...

03:06.792 --> 03:08.291
beep-- (pops lips)

03:09.417 --> 03:11.125
-outta your mind.
-Mark, mmm--

03:12.667 --> 03:13.625
You get it.

03:13.709 --> 03:15.625
Don't think about the brain surgery.

03:15.709 --> 03:17.625
(Spyder) Can you de-activate
the part of his brain

03:17.709 --> 03:19.583
that makes him
call all shoes loafers?

03:19.667 --> 03:22.166
Guys? Kinda need to focus.

03:24.709 --> 03:26.458
(whirring)

03:27.417 --> 03:29.417
(Veracity) You got the sample, Ryan!

03:30.125 --> 03:32.750
Okay, now get out of there
before you make him as smart as Spyder.

03:40.125 --> 03:40.959
Nice.

03:41.709 --> 03:45.083
(Veracity) A sample of the ooze
from when he monstered out the first time.

03:45.709 --> 03:47.417
Dang, son!

03:48.083 --> 03:50.875
I'm sorry, I just-- I just felt somebody
needed to say "Dang, son."

03:52.917 --> 03:54.083
(sighs) I miss Harris.

03:59.208 --> 04:03.125
The ooze's response to stimuli
is really aggressive.

04:04.333 --> 04:05.166
So...

04:06.375 --> 04:08.041
the ooze has been
weaponized by Traeger,

04:08.125 --> 04:10.083
which is why
the old antidote doesn't work.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.041
Well, then we amp up our cure.

04:12.125 --> 04:14.041
Way ahead of you, Plaid-lad.

04:15.291 --> 04:16.959
Sorry.
Without Harris, I need someone

04:17.041 --> 04:19.000
to focus my sarcasm on,
so that's you.

04:20.375 --> 04:26.125
Anyway, according to my tests,
the new ooze is susceptible

04:26.208 --> 04:28.500
to a certain kind
of pro-catalytic enzyme.

04:28.583 --> 04:32.250
We just have to...
borrow it from a hospital.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.667
-You mean steal it, right?
-Yeah, steal.

04:38.709 --> 04:39.542
Spyder?

04:40.208 --> 04:41.250
Mark?

04:41.333 --> 04:43.500
What happened?
I-- I can't remember anything!

04:43.583 --> 04:47.333
-You guys gotta help me!
-Save it. You're not fooling anyone.

04:47.417 --> 04:48.709
(growling)

04:48.792 --> 04:50.291
I can't wait to watch Traeger

04:50.375 --> 04:52.750
crush your bones into dust, pretty boy.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.166
(Spyder) Admit it. Evil Harris is cool.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.709
His hair game's on point.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.333
(Mark) I have an idea.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.458
(groans)

05:02.542 --> 05:04.166
-Little tight?
-(grunts)

05:04.250 --> 05:06.583
Maybe if you tell us
where Traeger is, I can loosen 'em.

05:06.667 --> 05:07.875
Dude, that's still Harris.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.041
What's Traeger's plan?

05:09.125 --> 05:11.875
Whoa!
What about a gentler approach?

05:11.959 --> 05:13.166
I know he's ticklish.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.375
(baby talk)

05:15.458 --> 05:16.667
Why would you know that?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.667
Oh, coochie coo-yoo--

05:19.500 --> 05:20.959
What are you guys doing?

05:21.041 --> 05:23.709
Eh-- W-- Ryan... what happened?
I-- I can't remember anything!

05:23.792 --> 05:25.375
Dude... give it up.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.667
(Mark) Puttin' on a little pressure.

05:27.750 --> 05:31.417
Might as well see
if we can... Extract a little info.

05:31.500 --> 05:32.375
Not cool, man.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.208
We need to cure him, not hurt him.

05:34.291 --> 05:36.959
He's our friend.
We don't hurt our own friends.

05:37.041 --> 05:38.041
He has answers we need.

05:38.125 --> 05:40.417
Didn't Harris help save Mom
from Harper Futuristics?

05:41.083 --> 05:44.250
Didn't he stay up with you
all night tutoring you in French?

05:44.333 --> 05:45.750
And algebra, and history.

05:46.542 --> 05:48.291
(Mark sighs) I get it, I get it.

05:48.375 --> 05:49.959
I'm really sorry, guys, you're right.

05:50.041 --> 05:51.500
I don't know what came over me.

05:51.583 --> 05:55.083
I will personally tear your flesh--
oooh-- ooh-ooh!

05:55.166 --> 05:56.208
Mmmm!

05:56.959 --> 05:58.667
-Where'd you get that?
-My foot.

05:58.750 --> 05:59.834
(muffled grunt)

06:00.542 --> 06:02.166
We need to get something
to cure Harris,

06:02.250 --> 06:04.166
but someone needs to stay here
and watch over him.

06:05.041 --> 06:07.166
-(Mark) Yeah, I'll do it.
-(Ryan) That makes sense.

06:07.250 --> 06:10.041
You've got the most experience
with Monster Harris anyway.

06:10.125 --> 06:12.500
Make sure he doesn't escape,
or hurt himself.

06:13.166 --> 06:14.000
Or you.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.625
I'm on it.

06:17.875 --> 06:18.792
Spyder, let's go.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.333
(grunting)

06:36.458 --> 06:39.333
Oh, come on.
Every time I wake up,

06:39.417 --> 06:41.375
I'm in another secret base.

06:42.291 --> 06:46.000
But I'm not dead. So, yay.

06:46.792 --> 06:48.041
You're awake?

06:48.125 --> 06:51.875
Yeah, and I don't have
weird spores growing out of my face.

06:51.959 --> 06:53.500
The red bloom?

06:54.166 --> 06:56.333
I removed it from your body
so you could be free

06:56.417 --> 06:58.667
of my influence for this conversation.

06:58.750 --> 06:59.959
Why am I here?

07:00.041 --> 07:01.250
Oh, wait...

07:03.083 --> 07:05.875
I'm guessing I'll hate
the answer to this question.

07:07.291 --> 07:08.667
Don't you know?

07:09.375 --> 07:11.792
Can't you feel our connection?

07:12.750 --> 07:15.583
I was born the day
you tried to conquer the world.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.500
You were linked to the beast.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.333
And when it was destroyed...

07:22.583 --> 07:25.041
(Harper) My DNA merged with the gel

07:25.125 --> 07:27.375
and... created you, so you're...

07:28.083 --> 07:29.125
we're...?

07:29.208 --> 07:32.166
Our DNA is identical.

07:32.834 --> 07:37.875
So the closest approximation
would be... brothers.

07:40.792 --> 07:43.375
You know why Ryan was cool
with leaving you behind, right?

07:43.458 --> 07:44.709
Mind games again?

07:44.792 --> 07:46.375
Get real, dude.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.709
He never got over
you being a jerk to him as a kid.

07:49.375 --> 07:50.583
What are you talkin' about?

07:50.667 --> 07:54.125
The teasing?
The "I am so awesome."

07:54.208 --> 07:56.917
The "hurt locker"? Ryan hates you.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.917
-He does not.
-Hello? Best friend over here.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.250
He tells me stuff.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.041
He doesn't even consider you
his real brother.

08:05.125 --> 08:06.333
"A," you're a liar.

08:07.083 --> 08:10.667
And "B"... I don't need to stand here
and listen to this.

08:15.458 --> 08:16.834
(grunts)

08:17.834 --> 08:19.083
Was it something I said?

08:20.792 --> 08:22.542
You're pathetic.

08:24.208 --> 08:26.709
(grunting)

08:26.792 --> 08:29.083
(Grace) Ryan? Mark?

08:29.166 --> 08:31.166
Ms. Walker! Hi!

08:31.917 --> 08:33.333
Harris, wh--?

08:33.417 --> 08:34.583
What's going on?

08:34.667 --> 08:36.166
Oh, this?

08:36.250 --> 08:38.417
We were playing manhunt.
I-- I got captured.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.125
Aren't you guys a little old
for games like this?

08:41.208 --> 08:44.166
Yes? But they tied me
a little too tight.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.542
Starting to lose circulation
in my fingers.

08:46.625 --> 08:49.250
Could you release me?
The control's behind you.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.250
Oh...

08:56.000 --> 08:57.333
Here you go.

08:57.417 --> 08:59.041
Shame on those boys.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.834
Thanks. You're a life saver.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.208
Get away from her.

09:04.917 --> 09:05.875
Great idea.

09:07.959 --> 09:09.917
(glass breaking)

09:17.792 --> 09:18.959
(growls)

09:24.166 --> 09:25.000
He's gone.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.333
Looks like he bought it. Thanks, Mom.

09:28.417 --> 09:29.875
Ohh!

09:29.959 --> 09:32.834
(laughs) I didn't even need
the belt you gave me.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.875
Good. Harris needs
to really think he escaped

09:34.959 --> 09:36.625
if he's gonna lead us to his boss.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.500
And Ryan's okay using Harris as bait?

09:38.583 --> 09:40.208
That-- That doesn't seem like Ryan.

09:40.291 --> 09:43.125
No. No, no, no. Ryan gets how important
it is to track Traeger down.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.750
Be safe. And bring Harris back.

09:53.625 --> 09:56.083
Okay.
We've just gotta try to lay low

09:56.166 --> 09:57.875
and not draw any attention to ourselves.

09:57.959 --> 09:59.834
We get the enzyme,
we get out, and cure Harris.

09:59.917 --> 10:00.834
Yeah.

10:00.917 --> 10:02.709
We need to stay under the radar.

10:03.417 --> 10:04.250
Spyder!

10:04.333 --> 10:06.458
Betty! Did Lucy have her puppies?

10:06.542 --> 10:07.458
Yeah.

10:08.625 --> 10:12.500
What? I-- I injure myself a lot.
The ER staff and I are tight.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.625
Hey, Kravitz!
Congrats on the promotion, man.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.500
W-- Come on, let's at least
try to blend in.

10:17.583 --> 10:19.000
Guys...

10:21.333 --> 10:22.250
-Put these on.
-Uh--

10:22.333 --> 10:25.583
We should take the west tower elevators.
They're much faster.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.125
All right, buddy!

10:31.208 --> 10:33.166
I'll see you in the cafeteria,
lasagna for lunch.

10:33.250 --> 10:34.250
Stop it!

10:34.333 --> 10:36.458
Oh, no, an electronic lock.

10:36.542 --> 10:38.166
How ever will we get in?

10:39.208 --> 10:40.458
I got this.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.583
I just have to break the door down
with my body.

10:43.166 --> 10:44.750
(grunting) Whoa!

10:44.834 --> 10:47.583
-(objects clattering)
-That sounded like bedpans.

10:47.667 --> 10:48.750
-Full ones.
-Mm-hm.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.166
(Spyder) Ewwww...

10:55.834 --> 10:57.500
(guard) What are you kids doin' here?

10:58.458 --> 10:59.750
You don't belong in here.

10:59.834 --> 11:02.375
This place is restricted
to medical staff only.

11:02.458 --> 11:05.208
Yeah-- heh-- that's us.

11:05.291 --> 11:07.625
-We are, uh, we're...
-Med students.

11:07.709 --> 11:08.917
-Yeah.
-First year.

11:15.166 --> 11:18.083
-You guys get younger every year.
-No, man, you're just gettin' old.

11:19.083 --> 11:22.041
We're supposed to take rounds
with the attending doctor.

11:22.125 --> 11:25.166
Oh, yeah, to learn,
y-- you know, doctor stuff.

11:26.542 --> 11:28.083
It does sound legit.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.667
Yeah, so... we'll be on our way,
and we'll get outta your hair.

11:30.750 --> 11:33.834
The doctor's with Mr. Patterson.
I'll take you to her.

11:33.917 --> 11:35.125
Perfect.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.875
That's right, little Harris.
Go back to your master.

11:52.959 --> 11:55.333
I don't need to stand here
and listen to this.

12:04.458 --> 12:05.291
Oh!

12:07.959 --> 12:09.041
You fear me.

12:09.125 --> 12:13.083
Uh, yeah, I-- you're terrifying, so...

12:13.166 --> 12:14.458
You don't have to.

12:14.542 --> 12:16.417
We are more alike than you know.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.959
Really?

12:18.041 --> 12:20.083
I woke with your ambitions.

12:20.166 --> 12:24.083
Your dreams. Your memories.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.542
Our mother's name was Constance.

12:32.083 --> 12:34.375
She used to make lemonade.

12:35.750 --> 12:36.583
Sour.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.917
We liked it that way.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.792
And when she passed...

12:43.959 --> 12:46.792
I remember... crying.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.625
I have this memory as well.

12:48.709 --> 12:49.917
Sadness.

12:51.125 --> 12:53.291
I do not like this emotion.

12:54.667 --> 12:56.375
Change of subject, Bro-seph.

12:56.458 --> 12:57.959
W-- We might share memories,

12:58.041 --> 13:00.959
but I don't remember
ever being into gardening.

13:01.041 --> 13:04.500
Ah, you experienced
the effects of the red bloom.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.834
An improvement on the brain bug
you used on Grace, yes?

13:07.917 --> 13:10.667
And you combined it
with an extinct flower.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.333
That spreads its venom
through its spores.

13:14.041 --> 13:15.875
Infecting many victims at once.

13:15.959 --> 13:18.834
And binding the entire planet
to my will.

13:18.917 --> 13:21.208
And I will end war.

13:21.291 --> 13:23.709
I will end hatred. I will--

13:23.792 --> 13:26.000
Save... the world.

13:27.166 --> 13:30.667
Is this your way
of carrying out my plan?

13:31.333 --> 13:32.625
Brothers.

13:34.792 --> 13:36.041
Brothers.

13:36.125 --> 13:38.750
-No.
-Too soon? Up top?

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
We'll get there.

13:42.375 --> 13:44.250
Doctor? The students are here.

13:44.917 --> 13:47.250
We're not scheduled
to have med students observe today.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.625
(phone dings)

13:51.875 --> 13:56.458
Oh. Fine. Let's see what
you've learned so far.

13:56.542 --> 13:59.083
And, yes, you're being graded on this.

14:02.041 --> 14:05.166
Ah, yes! Interesting.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.959
Mm. Oh?

14:08.041 --> 14:10.291
Stop stalling, what's
your differential diagnosis?

14:10.375 --> 14:11.458
Um--

14:14.417 --> 14:16.792
Charts don't heal people. I do.

14:16.875 --> 14:19.208
Now, tell me
about the day you got sick.

14:19.375 --> 14:22.291
Uhh... it was a pretty normal day.

14:22.375 --> 14:25.959
Uh, I went to work, came home.
Had some dinner--

14:26.041 --> 14:28.834
Ahh! Dinner, you say?

14:28.917 --> 14:31.333
I don't see the relevance
in this line of questioning--

14:31.417 --> 14:33.458
Uh-- Let the patient talk.

14:34.250 --> 14:38.667
Um... I made some
Disco Dogs double noodle soup.

14:38.750 --> 14:40.000
Disco Dogs...

14:41.417 --> 14:43.000
they haven't made that in forever.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.709
Tell me about the can. Was it bulging?

14:48.333 --> 14:49.667
Uhh--

14:49.750 --> 14:50.792
Tell me! Was it bulging?

14:50.875 --> 14:53.083
Yes! Yes, it was bulging!

14:53.166 --> 14:54.542
With flavor!

14:54.625 --> 14:56.000
What's wrong with that?

14:56.083 --> 14:57.583
It's botulism.

14:58.208 --> 15:00.750
The can was so old,
it was more bacteria than soup.

15:00.834 --> 15:03.875
I know this because I--
I eat out of a lot of bulging cans.

15:03.959 --> 15:05.792
-(others gasping)
-Even though I shouldn't.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.000
Wait, what?

15:07.083 --> 15:09.709
He needs an IV drip
of botulism antitoxin.

15:09.792 --> 15:11.333
And a pro-catalytic enzyme.

15:11.417 --> 15:12.917
That's not standard treatment.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.750
Clearly, you're not up to date
on the latest research.

15:15.834 --> 15:16.917
Well, I-- I-- uh--

15:17.000 --> 15:19.917
Please, don't
embarrass yourself further.

15:20.583 --> 15:22.375
Just... get it.

15:24.875 --> 15:28.333
(applause)

15:33.709 --> 15:35.291
(beeping)

15:37.667 --> 15:38.500
Gotcha.

15:51.875 --> 15:52.875
Hey!

15:53.500 --> 15:55.709
How's my favorite little scientist?
How you doin', buddy.

15:55.792 --> 15:58.208
I live to serve Traeger.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.333
Good talk. Good talk.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.583
So, I've been thinking
about the red bloom.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.583
You've got Grey out there
lookin' for a place

16:05.667 --> 16:07.208
to grow a lot of these babies, right?

16:07.291 --> 16:09.041
-Yes.
-Well,

16:09.125 --> 16:11.750
if we really
share the same memories...

16:14.709 --> 16:17.083
The Harper Futuristics greenhouse.

16:17.166 --> 16:20.583
Ho-ho! Now that... is a party trick.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.834
Pack your sun block, boys.
We're goin' to Brazil.

16:26.375 --> 16:28.208
Ryan...

16:28.834 --> 16:31.166
I know you're gonna be peeved
when you learn what I did,

16:31.250 --> 16:36.709
but... I was right.
I found Traeger, and there's more.

16:36.792 --> 16:38.291
Not for you there isn't.

16:44.291 --> 16:47.166
Harris? Mark? We've got the cure.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.000
Oh, hey, honey.

16:52.834 --> 16:55.083
Mom, what are you doin' here?

16:55.166 --> 16:57.333
Mark asked me to come.
To help with your plan.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.500
Oh! I also restocked your fridge
with healthy snacks,

16:59.583 --> 17:00.875
and threw away the stuff you like.

17:00.959 --> 17:02.208
-Darn!
-Oh, man.

17:02.291 --> 17:04.959
-Wait... what plan?
-(phone beeps)

17:05.041 --> 17:07.208
(Mark's voice) Ryan,
I know you're gonna be peeved

17:07.291 --> 17:09.333
when you learn what I did,
but... I was right!

17:09.417 --> 17:11.834
I found Traeger and... there's more.

17:11.917 --> 17:13.834
(Morris' voice) Not for you there isn't.

17:18.458 --> 17:20.083
Wakie, wakie.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.291
No? Heavy sleeper.

17:23.375 --> 17:25.083
(yelling) Mark, you're late
for the big game!

17:25.166 --> 17:26.458
I'm good, coach, I'm ready!

17:26.542 --> 17:28.125
(Traeger) Well, look who's awake.

17:31.542 --> 17:33.375
Awww, man.

17:33.458 --> 17:35.291
Can I do the honors?

17:38.333 --> 17:40.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy there, little buddy.

17:40.417 --> 17:42.125
Let's not be... too hasty.

17:42.208 --> 17:45.375
I mean, beyond
messing up these gorgeous floors

17:45.458 --> 17:48.709
with kid guts,
I think we're missing an opportunity.

17:50.333 --> 17:51.333
Continue.

17:51.417 --> 17:54.583
Well-- If Mark's here,
then Mech-X4 won't be far behind,

17:54.667 --> 17:59.000
and we can use our friend
as a-- a hostage, or as... a distraction.

17:59.083 --> 18:02.000
If we waste him now, he's useless.

18:02.083 --> 18:05.417
This... is a smart tactic.

18:12.041 --> 18:15.417
Okay, we are closing in
on where Mark's message came from.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.583
I can't believe Mark did this.

18:18.250 --> 18:20.291
(loud rumbling)

18:20.375 --> 18:22.125
Here they come.

18:22.208 --> 18:23.250
You guys are toast.

18:23.333 --> 18:26.333
My form is still too weak
to risk direct combat.

18:26.417 --> 18:29.166
And they still have
that upgraded X weapon.

18:29.250 --> 18:32.166
Sorry about that, by the way,
but... don't worry.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.667
I have a better idea.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.291
(growls)

18:41.917 --> 18:45.125
(Harper) Flight path--
directly into that nearby mountain.

18:46.709 --> 18:50.250
Oh, don't sweat it.
I'm sure Ryan will jump to your rescue.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.542
I don't get it.
Are you saving me or killing me?

18:52.625 --> 18:55.166
Whose side are you on? For real?

18:55.250 --> 18:57.125
Same side I'm always on...

18:58.208 --> 19:02.417
mine!
Hey... safety first, am I right?

19:04.875 --> 19:06.166
Have a good flight, okay?

19:17.917 --> 19:19.542
Let's take him down!

19:19.625 --> 19:20.792
Wai-- Wai-- Wait!

19:20.875 --> 19:23.667
I'm picking up on Mark's car flying
directly at that mountain.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.250
And Mark's inside!

19:28.000 --> 19:29.709
Come on, come on, come on!

19:31.291 --> 19:33.250
(grunting)

19:41.333 --> 19:42.834
(Spyder) Nice snag.

19:42.917 --> 19:43.917
Don't spike the ball.

19:45.166 --> 19:47.667
(laughs) Awww!

19:52.458 --> 19:54.750
(Veracity)
Traeger and company are gone.

19:54.834 --> 19:56.083
Harris?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.208
He's gone too.

20:00.792 --> 20:01.917
We lost him.

20:04.208 --> 20:05.792
And it's Mark's fault.

20:15.417 --> 20:18.208
Whoo! Nice save, bro!

20:22.250 --> 20:25.583
Okay, okay.
Uh, listen, I had to call an audible,

20:25.667 --> 20:27.750
but I managed to get some new info.

20:27.834 --> 20:30.041
Harper's working with Traeger
to create "the red bloom."

20:30.125 --> 20:32.000
Mark, we lost Harris because of you.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.375
They're headed to one
of Harper's greenhouses in Brazil--

20:34.458 --> 20:38.709
Mark! You told me you'd make sure
that Harris didn't escape.

20:38.792 --> 20:40.500
And then you helped him do it!

20:40.583 --> 20:42.458
I can't believe you lied.

20:42.542 --> 20:43.792
Right to my face!

20:43.875 --> 20:45.625
I can't believe
you put our friend in danger.

20:45.709 --> 20:47.291
(Mark) We had to find
where Traeger was.

20:47.375 --> 20:50.083
And I knew you wouldn't listen, Ryan.
And I put my own life in danger.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.875
And delivered Harris
right to the enemy.

20:53.417 --> 20:56.041
We got the cure.
If Harris was still here,

20:56.125 --> 20:57.250
he'd be fine by now.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.041
And we can still do that,
but what good is curing Harris,

21:00.125 --> 21:01.875
if Traeger
completely destroys the world?

21:01.959 --> 21:03.792
Mark's sorry.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.291
Why don't we leave it at that?

21:05.375 --> 21:07.750
Don't put words in my mouth.
I'm not sorry.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.583
I used Harris and I'd do it again.

21:09.667 --> 21:12.291
It didn't work out perfectly,
but we got the information we need

21:12.375 --> 21:14.333
to take down these guys
once and for all.

21:14.417 --> 21:16.709
We're not gonna win
always playing defense!

21:18.583 --> 21:20.125
That's not your problem anymore.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.208
What are you saying?

21:27.375 --> 21:30.000
I won't work with someone I can't trust.

21:36.542 --> 21:37.750
You're off the team.

22:03.125 --> 22:07.792
(theme music playing)
