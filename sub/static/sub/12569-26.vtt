00:03.379 --> 00:05.357
- Tony, I've got - a great idea for what
- We can do this Saturday!

00:05.381 --> 00:07.299
- I bet we're thinking
- the same thing!

00:07.341 --> 00:08.676
Art museum.

00:08.677 --> 00:10.010
Go bowling.

00:10.052 --> 00:11.450
Okay, you know

00:11.451 --> 00:12.847
I love going bowling

00:10.052 --> 00:12.847
with you

00:12.889 --> 00:14.849
and eating hot wings

00:14.850 --> 00:16.809
while inhaling

00:12.889 --> 00:16.809
shoe disinfectant,

00:16.851 --> 00:18.811
- but we just - went bowling
- Last weekend.

00:18.853 --> 00:19.980
Because the weekend before

00:19.981 --> 00:21.105
we went to The Met.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.358
Which, by the way,

00:23.359 --> 00:25.568
had nothing to do

00:21.146 --> 00:25.568
with the actual Mets!

00:25.610 --> 00:26.882
Yeah, I'm sorry you had

00:26.883 --> 00:28.153
to walk around the museum

00:25.610 --> 00:28.153
with a baseball mitt,

00:28.195 --> 00:29.447
- but I did buy
- you peanuts.

00:31.407 --> 00:32.634
- So, you want to
- grab some lunch?

00:32.658 --> 00:34.326
- As nice as
- that sounds, I can't.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.536
I'm stuck training

00:35.537 --> 00:36.704
some new doorman named Vic

00:36.746 --> 00:38.223
- who probably can't
- tell "push" from "pull"

00:38.247 --> 00:39.624
- Is that really
- a problem?

00:39.665 --> 00:40.917
You'd be surprised.

00:40.959 --> 00:42.231
Look at the hinges people.

00:42.232 --> 00:43.502
Look at the hinges!

00:45.087 --> 00:46.506
Yo, Tony, it's me,

00:46.507 --> 00:47.924
your new doorman!

00:51.928 --> 00:54.513
Uh-oh.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.119
I'm Vicky Montesano,

00:56.120 --> 00:57.683
Theresa's little sister.

00:57.725 --> 00:58.852
You probably don't

00:58.853 --> 00:59.978
recognize me since

00:57.725 --> 00:59.978
I lost the braces

01:00.019 --> 01:01.250
and had the nostril

01:01.251 --> 01:02.480
reduction surgery.

01:02.521 --> 01:03.898
Better, see?

01:06.275 --> 01:08.049
Holy cannoli!

01:08.050 --> 01:09.821
Little Vicky?

01:09.862 --> 01:12.073
Now I remember! I can still

01:12.074 --> 01:14.283

you worried about this?

Of course not!

the park and pray.

I mean, play.

Meditation can help

04:05.582 --> 04:06.998
you reduce your stress.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.917
doing nothing than me,

05:04.222 --> 05:05.327
why are you spreading

05:05.328 --> 05:06.431
your stench?

05:06.473 --> 05:08.330
Because your mumbo jumbo

05:08.331 --> 05:10.186
is not going to help Bertram

05:06.473 --> 05:10.186
get rid of his stress.

05:10.228 --> 05:11.647
Oh, so you think you

05:11.648 --> 05:13.064
have a better idea?

05:13.105 --> 05:15.233
Always.

05:15.274 --> 05:16.839
What Bertram needs

05:16.840 --> 05:18.402
is exercise. You know,

05:15.274 --> 05:18.402
to work up a sweat.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.445
Smells like you have

05:20.446 --> 05:22.447
worked up enough

05:18.443 --> 05:22.447
for both of you!

05:22.489 --> 05:23.699
It's a gift!

05:28.913 --> 05:30.455
Jessie,

05:30.497 --> 05:32.267
- remember you told me - about a
guy you dated - In high school

05:32.291 --> 05:33.417
Named Ted Hoover?

05:33.458 --> 05:34.815
Sure, he's the only guy

05:34.816 --> 05:36.170
I ever dumped.

05:36.212 --> 05:37.755
You dumped him?

05:37.796 --> 05:39.597
- What kind of horrific,
- troll beast was he?

05:41.508 --> 05:43.427
He wasn't a troll.

05:43.428 --> 05:45.345
He was just

05:45.387 --> 05:47.139
- a heavy, hairy
- in the wrong places,

05:47.181 --> 05:48.454
Slightly smelly

05:48.455 --> 05:49.725
toll booth attendant

05:47.181 --> 05:49.725
at our local bridge.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.478
Oh, my gosh,

05:53.479 --> 05:55.480
he might actually

05:51.476 --> 05:55.480
have been a troll.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.920
Well, I went on

05:56.921 --> 05:58.317
FacePage and found

05:55.522 --> 05:58.317
his profile pic.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.672
He's changed.

05:59.673 --> 06:00.986
And he's in town.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.363
So I invited him

06:02.364 --> 06:03.697
over so you can

06:01.028 --> 06:03.697
make Tony jealous.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.429
(SCOFFS) That won't work,

06:05.430 --> 06:07.118
not unless Ted

06:03.739 --> 06:07.118
has changed a lot.

06:15.690 --> 06:16.919
You've changed a lot!

06:20.464 --> 06:22.696
If he's the troll,

06:22.697 --> 06:24.927
I'm crossing that

06:20.464 --> 06:24.927
bridge every day.

06:24.969 --> 06:26.762
- Yeah, after you
- broke up with me,

06:26.804 --> 06:28.764
- I started working out
- and losing weight.

06:28.806 --> 06:30.475
Plus, I, uh, got

06:30.476 --> 06:32.143
the hump removed.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.769
I was gonna say,

06:33.770 --> 06:35.354
who did your hump work?

06:32.184 --> 06:35.354
'Cause it looks fantastic!

I'm Zuri.

06:38.296 --> 06:39.650
Hug me.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.569
Okay.

06:42.611 --> 06:43.758
Sorry. When Zuri

06:43.759 --> 06:44.905
sees something she

06:42.611 --> 06:44.905
wants, she goes for it.

06:49.701 --> 06:52.496
Handsome Man Convention?

06:54.957 --> 06:56.583
Zuri, that's just silly.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.022
Ooh, no, she's right.

06:58.023 --> 06:59.419
I'm a model now,

06:59.461 --> 07:00.754
and the IHMC is

07:00.755 --> 07:02.047
great for networking.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.009
Well, you guys obviously

07:06.010 --> 07:07.552
have a lot to catch up on.

07:07.594 --> 07:08.721
Right, so we should

07:08.722 --> 07:09.847
go to lunch.

07:09.888 --> 07:10.911
Through the lobby.

07:10.912 --> 07:11.932
Past the doorman.

07:11.974 --> 07:13.017
Okay, however

07:13.018 --> 07:14.059
you get to the street.

07:17.896 --> 07:20.565
Great plan, Emma.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.005
How did Jessie ever

07:22.006 --> 07:23.402
keep a man before us?

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

07:23.443 --> 07:24.486
She didn't.

07:24.528 --> 07:25.737
Oh, right.

07:36.748 --> 07:37.813
Twelve minutes.

07:37.814 --> 07:38.876
Not bad for a mile.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.128

07:40.129 --> 07:41.337
the 100 yard dash!

07:44.215 --> 07:45.757
at a hot dog cart.

You've got

07:57.542 --> 07:58.812
to be kidding.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.314
- We could do
- some more running.

No, I need some ice.

Maybe the snow cone

- Back. Back. Back. - Back. Back. Back.
- Back. Back. Back. Back.

16:17.895 --> 16:19.042
Hello?

16:19.043 --> 16:20.188
It's cold out here!

16:20.230 --> 16:21.732
So, work up

16:21.733 --> 16:23.233
a sweat exercising.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.902
Or, meditate

16:24.903 --> 16:26.528
until you believe

16:23.274 --> 16:26.528
you're warm.

16:26.570 --> 16:27.946
(CHUCKLING)

16:32.242 --> 16:33.327
Anyone want

16:33.328 --> 16:34.411
another Panini?

16:34.452 --> 16:35.829
(SIZZLING)

16:37.372 --> 16:39.374
No, thanks.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.376
My last one was

16:37.372 --> 16:41.376
a little linty.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.127
- This is a real
- nice apartment, Tone.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.650
And your neighbors

16:44.651 --> 16:46.130
are so friendly!

16:46.172 --> 16:47.424
Even the muggers

16:47.425 --> 16:48.675
have manners.

16:48.717 --> 16:50.031
Yeah, it's always nice

16:50.032 --> 16:51.344
to hear "please" before

16:48.717 --> 16:51.344
someone takes your wallet.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.639
- I'm glad
- you like it, Vic.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.766
Some people

16:55.767 --> 16:56.850
don't appreciate it.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.227
Just because it doesn't

16:58.228 --> 16:59.561
have fancy things

16:56.892 --> 16:59.561
like a doorman

16:59.603 --> 17:02.189
or air conditioning

17:02.190 --> 17:04.775
or a way to escape

16:59.603 --> 17:04.775
in the event of a fire.

17:04.816 --> 17:05.901
Well, excuse me for

17:05.902 --> 17:06.984
thinking you shouldn't

17:04.816 --> 17:06.984
live in a neighborhood

17:07.026 --> 17:09.237
called Murdertown.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.821
- It's not called
- "Murdertown!"

17:10.864 --> 17:12.053
It's "The Historic

17:12.054 --> 17:13.241
Murdertown District."

17:15.242 --> 17:16.516
Hey, you got

17:16.517 --> 17:17.788
a little something.

17:20.624 --> 17:22.424
- Hey, Ted, you got
- a little something, too.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.026
Oh, ow!

17:27.027 --> 17:28.047
Oh, whoa!

17:26.003 --> 17:28.047
What's the matter?

17:28.089 --> 17:29.653
Oh, I think

17:29.654 --> 17:31.217
I just cut myself

17:28.089 --> 17:31.217
on your cheekbones.

17:35.806 --> 17:37.432
- Okay, something's
- wrong here.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.350
- Why would
- you say that, Ted?

17:39.392 --> 17:40.623
There's nothing wrong with

17:40.624 --> 17:41.853
my girlfriend obsessing over

17:39.392 --> 17:41.853
her supermodel ex.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.521
- Or with my boyfriend
- taking hours

17:43.563 --> 17:44.960
To teach his beautiful

17:44.961 --> 17:46.357
protegee how to

17:43.563 --> 17:46.357
open a ding-dang door!

17:47.651 --> 17:49.527
- You've never
- understood my work!

17:49.569 --> 17:51.696
Opening doors is an art!

17:51.738 --> 17:54.778
- No, it's not! It's something - we all
do to keep from - Running into walls!

17:55.366 --> 17:57.265
Oh, look, Tony left

17:57.266 --> 17:59.162
the oven open!

17:59.203 --> 18:00.848
- Don't close it.
- That's the central heating.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.228
(CRASHING)

18:02.229 --> 18:03.583
(GROANS)

18:05.418 --> 18:06.649
What are you two

18:06.650 --> 18:07.879
doing here?

18:07.921 --> 18:09.194
Keeping you

18:09.195 --> 18:10.465
and Tony from making

18:07.921 --> 18:10.465
a huge mistake!

18:10.507 --> 18:11.734
- We're in this - relationship, too,
- You know!

18:11.758 --> 18:12.926
Okay, I haven't been

18:12.927 --> 18:14.093
this confused since

18:14.135 --> 18:15.595
that modeling shoot for

18:15.596 --> 18:17.055
reversible underwear.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.264
I still don't know if

18:18.265 --> 18:19.432
I had them on inside out.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.727
You're lucky

18:21.728 --> 18:22.853
you're pretty.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.939
Very pretty.

18:25.981 --> 18:27.128
Jessie, may I speak with

18:27.129 --> 18:28.274
you in the living room?

18:25.981 --> 18:28.274
Absolutely.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.865
- Why are you acting
- this way?

18:34.906 --> 18:36.449
- What way?
- I'm not acting in a way!

18:36.491 --> 18:37.617
If anyone's acting

18:37.618 --> 18:38.743
in a way, it's you!

18:38.785 --> 18:40.015
Well, if you don't like

18:40.016 --> 18:41.245
the way I act, maybe you

18:38.785 --> 18:41.245
should just go out with Ted!

18:43.456 --> 18:44.958
Maybe I should!

18:45.000 --> 18:46.143
- He and I have - a lot more in
- Common than we do.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.627
And if you think

18:47.628 --> 18:49.087
I don't understand you,

18:49.128 --> 18:50.648
- why don't you - just go out
- With Vic?

18:50.672 --> 18:51.882
Done!

18:51.923 --> 18:53.425
Whoa, Tony, hold

18:53.426 --> 18:54.926
your hair gel!

18:54.968 --> 18:56.803
- I did want
- to date you,

18:56.845 --> 18:58.097
But now that I see

18:58.098 --> 18:59.347
what a jealous mook

18:56.845 --> 18:59.347
you are, forget about it.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.934
- And Jessie, you didn't
- seem so interested

19:02.976 --> 19:04.249
When I looked like

19:04.250 --> 19:05.520
a "before" picture.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.520
(SIGHS)

19:05.562 --> 19:07.335
Plus, you dumped

19:07.336 --> 19:09.107
me by texting my mom!

19:09.148 --> 19:10.526
I wanted you to hear

19:10.527 --> 19:11.902
it from someone

19:09.148 --> 19:11.902
who actually cared about you!

19:12.861 --> 19:14.237
I'm not making

19:14.238 --> 19:15.613
it better, am I?

19:15.655 --> 19:16.969
Yikes, that is

19:16.970 --> 19:18.282
a bad way

19:15.655 --> 19:18.282
to dump someone.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.805
And that's coming from

19:19.806 --> 19:21.285
a girl who was once

19:18.324 --> 19:21.285
literally dumped...

19:21.327 --> 19:22.528
- Out of the back
- of a truck.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.249
That is no way

19:26.250 --> 19:27.333
to treat a lady.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.919
Hey,

19:28.960 --> 19:30.400
you want to let these

19:30.401 --> 19:31.838
guys duke it out

19:28.960 --> 19:31.838
and go grab some fro-yo?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.339
Okay!

19:33.381 --> 19:34.821
I know a great,

19:34.822 --> 19:36.259
cheap place on

19:33.381 --> 19:36.259
the corner.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.406
We just got to duck

19:37.407 --> 19:38.511
the police tape.

19:38.553 --> 19:39.700
Sweet. Oh, and

19:39.701 --> 19:40.847
don't worry about money.

19:40.889 --> 19:42.308
When you're as pretty

19:42.309 --> 19:43.725
as me, you never

19:40.889 --> 19:43.725
have to pay for stuff.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.021
I did not see

19:48.022 --> 19:49.022
that coming.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.297
Okay, you guys obviously

19:52.298 --> 19:54.111
need your privacy.

19:54.152 --> 19:55.353
- We'll wait in
- the bathroom.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.283
- (SIGHS)
- Jessie,

20:00.324 --> 20:02.181
What are we doing?

20:02.182 --> 20:04.037
This isn't us.

20:04.079 --> 20:05.705
Well, it wasn't us.

20:05.747 --> 20:06.831
But,

20:07.373 --> 20:08.458
the truth is,

20:08.499 --> 20:10.293
- things just haven't
- been the same lately.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.131
Have you felt that too?

20:14.132 --> 20:15.924
Actually, yeah.

20:15.966 --> 20:17.051
I used to love doing

20:17.052 --> 20:18.135
things I hate with you.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.261
Me too!

20:20.303 --> 20:21.784
But now I have to fight the

20:21.785 --> 20:23.264
urge to throw your bowling

20:20.303 --> 20:23.264
ball through a windshield!

20:23.306 --> 20:25.642
And if I have to watch a movie

20:25.643 --> 20:27.978
with subtitles one more time,

20:23.306 --> 20:27.978
I'll puke in my popcorn!

20:28.019 --> 20:29.940
- If I want to read,
- I'll pick up a comic book!

20:31.648 --> 20:33.524
So...

20:34.442 --> 20:35.985
I guess the spark

20:35.986 --> 20:37.528
is kind of gone.

20:39.614 --> 20:40.614
Kind of.

20:44.161 --> 20:45.183
Look, the truth is,

20:45.184 --> 20:46.204
I was attracted to Ted.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.331
Do you hate me?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.293
Actually, no.

20:52.335 --> 20:53.482
Because if I'm being

20:53.483 --> 20:54.629
honest, I had feelings

20:52.335 --> 20:54.629
for Vic, too.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.840
(SIGHS)

20:58.008 --> 21:02.595
So, what do we do now?

21:02.637 --> 21:04.952
I don't know.

21:04.953 --> 21:07.266
I mean, if we're

21:02.637 --> 21:07.266
noticing other people,

21:07.308 --> 21:08.727
maybe it's a sign

21:08.728 --> 21:10.145
that we should see

21:07.308 --> 21:10.145
other people.

21:10.187 --> 21:11.876
And maybe even

21:11.877 --> 21:13.564
date 'em.

21:13.606 --> 21:16.247
- I guess that's what you...
- That's what I meant - When I said...

21:17.235 --> 21:18.235
So...

21:19.320 --> 21:20.321
Are we breaking up?

21:22.532 --> 21:24.909
I guess so.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.745
(SIGHS)

21:27.787 --> 21:29.101
And I will

21:29.102 --> 21:30.414
always love you.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.542
I'll always love you, too.

21:32.583 --> 21:33.584
Friends, right?

21:33.585 --> 21:34.585
Absolutely!

21:35.503 --> 21:37.047
- Friends.
- Always.

21:38.048 --> 21:39.632
(BLOWING NOSES)

21:39.674 --> 21:40.550
(SOBBING HYSTERICALLY)

21:40.591 --> 21:41.739
How could you

21:41.740 --> 21:42.886
do this to us?

21:42.927 --> 21:44.388
I feel like I've been

21:44.389 --> 21:45.847
kicked in the gut!

21:45.889 --> 21:47.244
And you couldn't

21:47.245 --> 21:48.599
have sprung for two-ply?

21:51.435 --> 21:53.417
Girls, come here,

21:53.418 --> 21:55.398
it'll be okay.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.691
Look, soon, this will all

21:56.692 --> 21:57.942
be just another one

21:55.439 --> 21:57.942
of my break-up stories

21:57.984 --> 21:59.298
that I tell over

21:59.299 --> 22:00.611
and over and over.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.780
(BOTH SOBBING HYSTERICALLY)

22:02.822 --> 22:04.615
Okay, I get it.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.013
This may be the wrong

22:06.014 --> 22:07.368
time to mention this,

22:07.410 --> 22:08.599
but there's definitely

22:08.600 --> 22:09.787
something swimming

22:07.410 --> 22:09.787
in this toilet.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.789
- (SQUEAKING)
- (ALL SCREAM)

22:15.210 --> 22:16.670
So, Ted and Vic

22:16.671 --> 22:18.129
ended up together,

22:18.171 --> 22:19.756
Tony and I broke up,

22:19.757 --> 22:21.340
and to top it all off,

22:21.382 --> 22:23.022
- I had to fish a rat
- out of the toilet!

22:24.427 --> 22:26.200
Still sounds like one

22:26.201 --> 22:27.972
of your better dates.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.828
Sympathetic as always,

22:29.829 --> 22:31.642
but thanks you for

22:28.014 --> 22:31.642
listening, Bertram.

22:32.143 --> 22:33.811
Meow.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.294
Okay, you can stop

22:37.295 --> 22:38.524
listening now!

22:38.566 --> 22:39.984
- What is wrong with
- you, Bertram?

22:42.237 --> 22:43.837
- I'm sorry, you were
- saying something?

22:45.323 --> 22:46.658
Maybe I should start

22:46.659 --> 22:47.992
confiding in Emma.
