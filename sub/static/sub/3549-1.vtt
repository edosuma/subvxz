WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:04.075
(Mary Alice) FIVE YEARS AGO,

00:04.075 --> 00:06.377
SUSAN DELFINO
GAVE BIRTH TO A SON

00:06.377 --> 00:11.042
IN DELIVERY ROOM "A"
OF FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.

00:11.042 --> 00:12.543
MOMENTS LATER,

00:12.543 --> 00:15.046
LILA DASH
GAVE BIRTH TO A DAUGHTER

00:15.046 --> 00:16.547
IN DELIVERY ROOM "B."

00:19.150 --> 00:22.723
AROUND 10:00 THE NEXT MORNING,

00:22.723 --> 00:26.197
AS THE TWO NEW MOTHERS
WERE LEAVING THE HOSPITAL,

00:26.197 --> 00:29.500
THEY NEARLY
RAN INTO EACH OTHER.

00:29.500 --> 00:34.165
OF COURSE,
THEY NEVER KNEW THIS.

00:34.165 --> 00:35.666
IN FACT,

00:35.666 --> 00:38.169
SUSAN AND LILA WOULD HAVE BEEN
SURPRISED TO KNOW

00:38.169 --> 00:42.042
HOW OFTEN THEIR PATHS
WOULD CROSS OVER THE YEARS.

00:42.042 --> 00:47.378
THEY ALMOST MET
AT THE LOCAL COFFEE SHOP...

00:47.378 --> 00:53.184
AND ANOTHER TIME AT
THEIR VETERINARIAN'S OFFICE...

00:53.184 --> 00:58.529
AND AGAIN IN THE BLEACHERS
OF THE FAIRVIEW FLYERS.

00:58.529 --> 01:01.832
BUT DESPITE
THESE CLOSE CALLS,

01:01.832 --> 01:05.336
SUSAN AND LILA NEVER MET...

01:07.568 --> 01:10.741
UNTIL ONE TUESDAY,
WHEN SUSAN DECIDED

01:10.741 --> 01:13.244
TO TAKE HER HUSBAND
TO A FANCY RESTAURANT

01:13.244 --> 01:15.576
FOR THEIR ANNIVERSARY...

01:15.576 --> 01:18.109
AT THE SAME TIME,
LILA DECIDED

01:18.109 --> 01:21.352
TO TAKE HER DAUGHTER
TO BUY SOME ICE CREAM.

01:21.352 --> 01:25.416
THAT WAS THE NIGHT
THAT SUSAN DELFINO

01:25.416 --> 01:27.388
AND LILA DASH

01:27.388 --> 01:29.390
FINALLY RAN INTO EACH OTHER.

01:29.390 --> 01:32.193
(horn honks, tires screech)

01:41.101 --> 01:44.205
(hissing)

01:47.638 --> 01:49.840
(metal creaking)

01:49.840 --> 01:53.484
(grunting)

01:53.484 --> 01:54.885
AAH!

01:54.885 --> 01:57.888
(grunting and gasping)

02:05.296 --> 02:21.141
(Susan) MIKE!

02:21.141 --> 02:24.275
IT WILL HAPPEN TO ALL OF US
EVENTUALLY.

02:24.275 --> 02:28.619
THE MOMENT WILL COME
WHEN WE ASK OURSELVES...

02:28.619 --> 02:32.323
WHERE DID THE TIME GO?

02:32.323 --> 02:37.358
HOW DID THE CHILDREN
I ONCE CRADLED...

02:37.358 --> 02:40.691
GROW UP SO VERY QUICKLY?

02:44.635 --> 02:46.937
HOW DID THE LIFE I DREAMT OF...

02:46.937 --> 02:52.643
TURN INTO A CAREER
I NEVER EXPECTED?

02:54.775 --> 02:59.910
AND HOW DID THAT WOMAN
I SAW EACH DAY IN THE MIRROR...

02:59.910 --> 03:05.185
BECOME SOMEONE
I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.658
JUANITA, THIS DRESS
IS AWFULLY TIGHT.

03:07.658 --> 03:09.920
I DON'T THINK
YOU CAN GET INTO IT.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.623
NO, IT'S PRETTY.
I CAN DO IT.

03:12.623 --> 03:15.796
HOW'S THAT ONE FIT?
 OH, I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED
THE NEXT SIZE UP.

03:15.796 --> 03:17.498
AHEM!

03:21.632 --> 03:24.275
UH, THERE IS NO
NEXT SIZE UP.

03:24.275 --> 03:27.408
THEY DON'T MAKE PRINCESS DRESSES
FOR GIRLS OVER 7.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.240
SHE'S ONLY 4 1/2.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.512
OH.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.743
WOW.

03:32.743 --> 03:34.745
LOOK, MY DAUGHTER WAS INVITED
TO A PRINCESS PARTY,

03:34.745 --> 03:36.747
SO I CAN'T LET HER

03:36.747 --> 03:39.450
BE THE ONLY GIRL THERE
WITHOUT A PRINCESS DRESS.

03:39.450 --> 03:41.452
DID YOU TRY
THE COSTUME SECTION?

03:41.452 --> 03:44.925
I BET THEY'D HAVE A MRS. SHREK
DRESS THAT WOULD FIT HER.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.927
JUANITA, TAKE OFF THE DRESS!
WE'RE GOING.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.929
(Juanita) NO! I CAN DO IT.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.302
LOOK, I FEEL FOR YOU.

03:51.302 --> 03:54.905
MY NIECE ALSO HAS
A WEIGHT PROBLEM.
 MY DAUGHTER DOES NOT HAVE
A WEIGHT PROBLEM.

03:54.905 --> 03:57.268
SHE HAS A LITTLE BABY FAT,
THAT'S ALL.

03:57.268 --> 03:59.270
IN FACT,
THE ONLY PROBLEM SHE HAS

03:59.270 --> 04:01.342
IS THIS STORE
BEING COMPLETELY UNPREPARED

04:01.342 --> 04:03.314
FOR A PERFECTLY AVERAGE
4-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

04:03.314 --> 04:05.876
(fabric rips)
 UH-OH.

04:07.478 --> 04:10.451
JUST RING IT UP.

04:13.724 --> 04:15.025
(sighs)
 (camera shutter snaps)

04:15.025 --> 04:16.887
(man) NO, NO, NO!

04:16.887 --> 04:18.889
OH, FOR GOD SAKES.
WHAT'S WRONG NOW?

04:18.889 --> 04:21.031
ONCE AGAIN,

04:21.031 --> 04:23.464
THE CONCEPT IS, SWEETIE,

04:23.464 --> 04:26.467
YOU'RE TAKING THE PIE
OUT OF THE OVEN,

04:26.467 --> 04:28.469
YOUR FACE AGLOW
WITH SURPRISE.

04:28.469 --> 04:31.502
WHY AM I SURPRISED?
 BECAUSE IT TURNED OUT
SO PERFECTLY.

04:31.502 --> 04:35.406
WELL, THAT'S NO SURPRISE.
MY PIES ARE ALWAYS PERFECT.

04:35.406 --> 04:38.709
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S YOUR BEST PIE EVER.

04:38.709 --> 04:40.711
YOU'VE TOPPED YOURSELF.
HMM?

04:40.711 --> 04:43.914
MM. AND I KNOW THIS
 BEFORE I'VE TASTED IT?

04:43.914 --> 04:47.458
(sighs) SWEETIE, JUST MAKE
WHATEVER FACE YOU WANT.

04:47.458 --> 04:49.460
I JUST THINK
YOU'LL SELL MORE COOKBOOKS

04:49.460 --> 04:51.462
IF YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE

04:51.462 --> 04:54.024
YOU JUST MADE LOVE
TO AN ICE CUBE.

04:54.024 --> 04:56.997
ANDREW, DEAR, I'M GOING TO
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.999
WOULD YOU PLEASE
TELL THIS GENTLEMAN

04:58.999 --> 05:01.632
THAT IF HE CALLS ME "SWEETIE"
ONE MORE TIME,

05:01.632 --> 05:04.635
I'M GONNA GRAB HIS CAMERA
AND TAKE A PICTURE OF HIS COLON?

05:06.006 --> 05:07.878
YOU GOT THAT, RIGHT?

05:12.312 --> 05:15.946
KATHERINE, HI.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
 THE WAITERS NEED TO BE PAID,

05:15.946 --> 05:18.389
AND YOU TOOK THE KEY
TO THE CASHBOX... AGAIN.

05:18.389 --> 05:21.952
OH. SORRY. PAID FOR WHAT?
 THE ARMENIAN WEDDING?
LUNCH FOR 300?

05:21.952 --> 05:25.095
IT WAS RIGHT AFTER THE BREAKFAST
FOR THE GARDEN CLUB,

05:25.095 --> 05:27.428
WHICH YOU ALSO MISSED.
 LOOK, I'M SORRY.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.930
I DIDN'T KNOW A PHOTO SHOOT
WOULD TAKE THIS LONG.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.963
I MEAN, WHO KNEW IT'D BE THIS
HARD TO POSE FOR A BOOK COVER?

05:32.963 --> 05:34.465
OH, YOU'LL BE FINE.

05:34.465 --> 05:36.907
IF THERE'S ONE THING
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT,

05:36.907 --> 05:38.909
IT'S POSING AS A CHEF.
 OKAY, KATHERINE.

05:38.909 --> 05:41.412
I KNOW THIS BOOK HAS BEEN
MONOPOLIZING MY TIME,

05:41.412 --> 05:43.414
AND YOU FEEL OVERWORKED
AND UNDERVALUED.

05:43.414 --> 05:47.478
BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOU.
IN FACT, I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU.

05:47.478 --> 05:50.050
IT'S THE GALLEYS
OF MY NEW BOOK.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.052
READ PAGE 2.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.656
"FOR KATHERINE MAYFAIR--

05:55.656 --> 05:57.558
"A WONDERFUL COOK

05:57.558 --> 05:59.690
AND AN EVEN BETTER FRIEND."

06:01.091 --> 06:03.494
YOU DEDICATED IT TO ME?

06:03.494 --> 06:05.996
WELL, YOU MAKE THIS
ALL POSSIBLE.

06:05.996 --> 06:08.699
(chuckles) IT'S THE LEAST
I COULD DO.

06:08.699 --> 06:10.370
AHEM! EXCUSE ME.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.643
TIME IS MONEY.
CHOP-CHOP, SWEETIE.

06:15.746 --> 06:20.150
ANDREW...
DO WE HAVE A BACKUP PIE?

06:20.150 --> 06:22.653
YES. YES, WE DO.

06:22.653 --> 06:23.954
GOOD.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.420
(horn honking in distance)

06:29.420 --> 06:31.822
(indistinct conversations)

06:31.822 --> 06:33.824
(laughter)

06:33.824 --> 06:36.597
AND THE BIG BLIND...

06:36.597 --> 06:39.470
CATCHES A JACK
ON THE RIVER.

06:41.171 --> 06:42.833
PRESTON?

06:42.833 --> 06:43.934
MOM!

06:43.934 --> 06:47.037
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?
 DON'T FREAK OUT.

06:47.037 --> 06:49.840
WE'RE JUST PLAYING CARDS.
 OH, YEAH? WHY DIDN'T YOU
PLAY AT HOME?

06:49.840 --> 06:51.842
WHY DID YOU
HAVE TO SNEAK IN HERE?

06:51.842 --> 06:53.844
TEQUILA SHOTS! 5 BUCKS!

06:53.844 --> 06:55.716
(all cheering)

06:55.716 --> 06:57.047
AH.

06:57.047 --> 06:58.949
ASKED AND ANSWERED.

06:58.949 --> 07:02.823
OKAY, THAT'S IT!
EVERYBODY OUT. GAME'S OVER.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.125
CAN I HAVE YOUR CHAIR
FOR A SECOND?

07:05.125 --> 07:07.828
HEY! LOOK UP HERE!
MOM'S HERE. PARTY'S OVER.

07:07.828 --> 07:11.602
DOOR'S OPEN. OUT YOU GO.
GO ON. SHOO!

07:11.602 --> 07:13.934
(Lynette) WOW.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.837
YOU GUYS HAVE PULLED
A LOT OF STUPID STUNTS.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.509
BUT THIS?

07:18.509 --> 07:20.010
THIS?

07:20.010 --> 07:23.113
RISKING OUR LIQUOR LICENSE,
OUR LIVELIHOOD?

07:23.113 --> 07:25.115
WHO'S GOING TO FIND OUT?

07:25.115 --> 07:28.779
I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN RUNNING THIS
GAME FOR A MONTH, AND NOBODY--

07:28.779 --> 07:31.822
UNBELIEVABLE. YOU GUYS
ARE GROUNDED FOR TWO WEEKS.

07:31.822 --> 07:33.854
BUT WE HAVE HOMECOMING.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.627
YEAH, YEAH! KEEP COMPLAINING.
I'D LOVE TO MAKE IT A YEAR.

07:36.627 --> 07:39.059
NOW CLEAN THIS PLACE UP. NOW!

07:44.965 --> 07:46.466
(panting)

07:46.466 --> 07:47.638
OH.

07:47.638 --> 07:48.899
OH.

07:48.899 --> 07:53.103
WOW. THAT WAS FANTASTIC.

07:53.103 --> 07:54.645
AMAZING.

07:54.645 --> 07:55.806
(giggles)

07:55.806 --> 07:57.477
WHEW. YOU WERE INCREDIBLE.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.479
SO WERE YOU. (chuckles)

07:59.479 --> 08:03.914
OH. AND...
(grunts and sighs)

08:03.914 --> 08:05.215
TIME TO GO.

08:05.215 --> 08:07.257
(panting)

08:07.257 --> 08:08.719
WHEW.

08:08.719 --> 08:10.120
SUSAN?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.122
(grunts)
 SO IT'S BEEN, WHAT,
FOUR MONTHS?

08:12.122 --> 08:14.995
ARE YOU EVER GONNA
LET ME SPEND THE NIGHT?

08:14.995 --> 08:17.027
I DON'T KNOW.
COME ON, ZIPPY, ZIPPY.

08:17.027 --> 08:19.700
OKAY.
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW...

08:19.700 --> 08:22.873
(zips up pants)
 GIRLS USUALLY BEG ME
TO SPEND THE NIGHT.

08:22.873 --> 08:24.875
WELL, GOOD, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE ANY PROBLEM

08:24.875 --> 08:27.878
FINDING A PLACE TO SLEEP.
 FINE. I KNOW THE DRILL.

08:27.878 --> 08:30.841
I CAN'T SPEND THE NIGHT.
I CAN'T MEET YOUR FRIENDS.

08:30.841 --> 08:32.842
I CAN'T MEET YOUR SON.
I'M JUST WONDERING--

08:32.842 --> 08:36.046
IS THIS EVER GONNA
TURN INTO SOMETHING NORMAL?
 YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A GUY,

08:36.046 --> 08:38.048
AND WE JUST HAD HOT SEX,

08:38.048 --> 08:40.551
AND I DIDN'T FORCE YOU
TO CUDDLE.

08:40.551 --> 08:42.722
SO RUN! GO!
BRAG TO YOUR FRIENDS.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.124
LOOK...

08:44.124 --> 08:46.827
I LIKE YOU,
AND I KNOW YOU LIKE ME.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.800
SO WHY CAN'T WE BE A COUPLE?

08:51.702 --> 08:54.134
'CAUSE I'M... NOT READY
FOR THAT.

08:54.134 --> 08:58.138
AND WHAT WE'VE GOT--
THAT'S ALL I CAN HANDLE.

09:02.112 --> 09:03.914
(light slap)
 GO.

09:03.914 --> 09:05.916
OKAY, BUT THAT'S
ONLY GONNA WORK, LIKE,

09:05.916 --> 09:07.918
500 OR 600 MORE TIMES.

09:07.918 --> 09:09.049
(giggles)

09:18.058 --> 09:20.761
(man) GOOD EVENING.
 CAN I HELP YOU?

09:20.761 --> 09:24.965
WRONG QUESTION.
THE QUESTION IS, CAN I HELP YOU?

09:24.965 --> 09:27.067
LOOK, IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO SELL ME SOMETHING,

09:27.067 --> 09:29.069
I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.341
YOU DO NOW.

09:31.341 --> 09:33.103
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

09:33.103 --> 09:36.246
I'M HERE TO BUY YOU
OUT OF YOUR LEASE.

09:36.246 --> 09:38.048
WHAT?

09:38.048 --> 09:39.750
I KNOW. IT'S SUDDEN.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.212
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS HOUSE THAT...

09:42.212 --> 09:44.985
WELL, IT JUST
FEELS LIKE HOME TO ME.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.758
SO I'D LIKE TO MOVE IN...
TONIGHT.

09:47.758 --> 09:49.589
TONIGHT? ARE YOU CRAZY?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.692
A LITTLE BIT.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.093
OKAY, HERE.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.225
I WILL MORE THAN COVER
YOUR MOVING EXPENSES.

09:55.225 --> 09:59.199
LOOK, UH...
I-I'M ALL SET UP HERE.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.132
BESIDES, MY LANDLADY
WOULD NEVER ALLOW IT.

10:02.132 --> 10:04.234
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
WORRY ABOUT HER?

10:04.234 --> 10:07.337
MM, NO. I-I DON'T HAVE
ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO.

10:07.337 --> 10:09.339
I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE.

10:11.882 --> 10:14.244
LOOK, RAYMOND...

10:14.244 --> 10:16.647
HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

10:16.647 --> 10:18.789
I MADE YOU
A VERY GENEROUS OFFER,

10:18.789 --> 10:21.792
AND I JUST KNOW YOU'RE GOING
TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION.

10:21.792 --> 10:22.953
FIVE.

10:22.953 --> 10:25.095
FIVE WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:25.095 --> 10:26.827
FOUR.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.829
ARE YOU--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.862
THREE.
 O-OKAY. HANG ON FOR A SECOND.

10:31.862 --> 10:33.403
TWO.

10:37.037 --> 10:40.210
WELL, RAYMOND,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

10:41.712 --> 10:44.715
HERE YOU GO. TAKE CARE.

10:49.419 --> 10:52.152
ALL TAKEN CARE OF...
MRS. WILLIAMS.

10:54.785 --> 10:57.958
THANK YOU... MR. WILLIAMS.

11:07.137 --> 11:08.999
THE NEXT MORNING,

11:08.999 --> 11:12.202
EDIE BRITT DECIDED TO ANNOUNCE
HER RETURN TO WISTERIA LANE

11:12.202 --> 11:15.846
IN A WAY...
THAT WAS GUARANTEED...

11:15.846 --> 11:20.280
TO MAKE A BIG SPLASH.

11:24.454 --> 11:26.056
(bottles clink)

11:30.761 --> 11:32.062
(dials cell phone)

11:34.224 --> 11:37.227
OKAY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS, BUT...

11:37.227 --> 11:40.030
(singsong voice) SHE'S BACK.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.145
EDIE? IS THAT REALLY YOU?

11:55.145 --> 11:59.089
YOU KNOW SOMEONE ELSE MY AGE
WITH A BODY LIKE THIS?

11:59.089 --> 12:02.122
SO YOU'RE BACK?

12:02.122 --> 12:04.254
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR TENANT?

12:04.254 --> 12:06.957
HE, UH, CAME INTO SOME MONEY
AND DECIDED TO MOVE.

12:06.957 --> 12:09.159
WE THOUGHT,
WHAT THE HECK? LET'S MOVE BACK!

12:09.159 --> 12:11.161
"WE"?

12:11.161 --> 12:14.034
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW.
I HAVE A HUSBAND NOW.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.266
REALLY? WHOSE?

12:18.208 --> 12:20.871
SO I'M IN VEGAS TALKING
TO THIS REAL ESTATE CONVENTION.

12:20.871 --> 12:22.873
I DO A LITTLE
MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKING.

12:22.873 --> 12:25.415
AND THERE--
SIXTH ROW, CENTER AISLE,

12:25.415 --> 12:28.178
IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

12:28.178 --> 12:30.150
(Edie chuckles)
 SO AFTER I FINISH,

12:30.150 --> 12:32.252
I WALK INTO THE AUDIENCE
AND I ASK THIS GODDESS OUT.

12:32.252 --> 12:36.056
HIS SEMINAR WAS CALLED
"GETTING WHAT YOU WANT,"

12:36.056 --> 12:38.088
AND HE DID...

12:38.088 --> 12:40.831
THREE TIMES. HMM.
 BEFORE DINNER.

12:40.831 --> 12:44.164
(Lynette and Edie chuckle)
 WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY NICE
TO MEET YOU, DAVE,

12:44.164 --> 12:46.536
AND LET US BE THE FIRST
TO WELCOME YOU TO WISTERIA LANE.

12:46.536 --> 12:49.139
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE SHOULD
HAVE A DINNER OR SOMETHING.

12:49.139 --> 12:52.472
OH, LET'S MAKE IT A PARTY.
WE COULD DO IT AT MY RESTAURANT.
 WE'D BE HONORED.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.245
THANK YOU.

12:55.245 --> 12:57.207
SO, GABY, I HAVE TO ASK.

12:57.207 --> 13:00.210
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU?
I MEAN, LOOK AT YOU.

13:00.210 --> 13:03.353
YOUR--YOUR CLOTHES,
YOUR--YOUR HAIR.

13:03.353 --> 13:07.557
(laughs) CARLOS MIGHT BE BLIND,
BUT THE REST OF US AREN'T.
 I HAD TWO CHILDREN.

13:07.557 --> 13:09.219
FOR WHAT? BREAKFAST?

13:09.219 --> 13:13.093
EDIE? ON YOUR FIRST DAY BACK
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

13:16.897 --> 13:18.929
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:18.929 --> 13:20.400
I'M SORRY, GABY.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.804
IT WAS RUDE AND INSENSITIVE,
AND IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

13:24.804 --> 13:28.238
REALLY?

13:28.238 --> 13:29.179
OKAY.

13:30.881 --> 13:33.914
NOW SHOULDN'T WE OFFER
YOUR FRIENDS SOMETHING TO EAT?

13:33.914 --> 13:36.116
OOH! I BAKED SOME MUFFINS.

13:41.051 --> 13:43.223
PLEASE DON'T TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY, BUT...

13:43.223 --> 13:46.156
WE LOVE YOU.

13:46.156 --> 13:47.257
(chuckles)

13:52.232 --> 13:55.035
MIJITA! LUNCH IS READY.
GO GET YOUR SISTER.

13:55.035 --> 13:58.038
♪♪♪

13:59.940 --> 14:03.173
CARLOS,
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE CHEESE?

14:03.173 --> 14:05.175
YOU KNOW HOW JUANITA FEELS
ABOUT BRUSSELS SPROUTS.

14:05.175 --> 14:08.048
I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE VEGETABLES MORE FUN.
 WELL, NEXT TIME,

14:08.048 --> 14:11.181
GIVE HER A CARROT
AND PUT HER ON A ROLLER COASTER.

14:11.181 --> 14:14.424
HAVE YOU TRIED
TO LIFT HER LATELY?
 I KNOW SHE'S GOTTEN CHUBBY.
SHE'LL GROW OUT OF IT.

14:14.424 --> 14:16.426
HA! WE CAN ONLY HOPE

14:16.426 --> 14:19.429
WITH YOUR D.N.A.
RUNNING THROUGH HER VEINS.
 HEY, I DO NOT HAVE FAT D.N.A.

14:19.429 --> 14:22.432
OH, DON'T MAKE ME PULL OUT
THE SOLIS FAMILY PHOTO ALBUM.

14:22.432 --> 14:25.865
IT'S LIKE A BUNCH OF SEA LIONS
POSING ON A ROCK.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.867
WELL, I'M SORRY MY RELATIVES
DON'T MEASURE UP TO

14:27.867 --> 14:30.200
THE GROUP OF STICK-THIN DRUNKS
THAT YOU COME FROM.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.203
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT OUR
DAUGHTER HAS A WEIGHT PROBLEM,

14:33.203 --> 14:36.206
AND THE SOONER WE ADMIT IT,
THE BETTER.
 SHE'S ONLY 4.

14:36.206 --> 14:39.549
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU WANT HER
TO DEVELOP A WEIGHT PROBLEM?

14:39.549 --> 14:42.312
GO AHEAD. NAG, CRITICIZE,
MAKE HER FEEL SELF-CONSCIOUS.

14:42.312 --> 14:43.914
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.891
AND OBVIOUSLY I AM NOT
GETTING THROUGH TO THE TWINS,

14:51.891 --> 14:54.894
BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT I SAY,
THEY KEEP PULLING THIS CRAP,

14:54.894 --> 14:57.467
AND I AM SICK OF IT.
 HONEY, COULD YOU...

14:57.467 --> 14:59.069
SORRY.

14:59.069 --> 15:01.972
YEAH. (chuckles) SO YOU--
YOU WANT ME TO TALK TO THEM?

15:01.972 --> 15:04.274
YOU HAVE TO. I AM TIRED
OF BEING THE BAD COP.

15:04.274 --> 15:07.237
YOU WALK THE BEAT FOR A WHILE.
 FINE.
YOU KNOW, BOYS THIS AGE,

15:07.237 --> 15:10.210
THEY'RE MORE LIKELY
TO LISTEN TO THEIR DADS ANYWAY.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.511
I-I CAN HANDLE THIS.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.513
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.246
HONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'D APPRECIATE? COULD YOU...

15:16.246 --> 15:17.647
SORRY.

15:22.222 --> 15:25.055
(laughter)

15:25.055 --> 15:28.198
(Porter) SO KIRBY HAS
ACES IN THE HOLE...
 (Tom) YEAH.

15:28.198 --> 15:30.100
WHICH MEANS THAT BOBBY

15:30.100 --> 15:34.164
WILL HAVE TO WEAR A DRESS
TO SCHOOL ON MONDAY.
 OH! OH, MY! OKAY.

15:34.164 --> 15:37.607
(laughs) YOU'VE GOT TO GET
A PICTURE OF THAT!

15:37.607 --> 15:41.271
TOM?
CAN I TALK TO YOU A SEC?

15:41.271 --> 15:43.073
YEAH.

15:43.073 --> 15:44.374
DON'T YOU THINK

15:44.374 --> 15:47.077
YOU WERE KIND OF SENDING
THE WRONG MESSAGE IN THERE?

15:47.077 --> 15:49.379
I KNOW WE DON'T APPROVE
OF WHAT THEY DID,

15:49.379 --> 15:51.081
BUT YOU--YOU GOTTA ADMIT.

15:51.081 --> 15:53.383
COME ON. STARTING THEIR
OWN CASINO IS KIND OF CREATIVE.

15:53.383 --> 15:56.256
YEAH? "CREATIVE" LIKE SELLING
FAKE I.D.s WAS CREATIVE.

15:56.256 --> 15:59.089
AND HOT-WIRING McCLUSKEY'S CAR--
THAT WAS A WORK OF ART.

15:59.089 --> 16:01.231
HONEY, HONEY,
THIS IS NOTHING LIKE THAT.

16:01.231 --> 16:03.233
I MEAN, LOOK,
THE WHOLE SCHOOL

16:03.233 --> 16:05.235
IS TALKING
ABOUT THEIR CARD GAME.

16:05.235 --> 16:07.237
DO YOU REALIZE IT WAS,
LIKE,

16:07.237 --> 16:09.499
THE PLACE TO BE
ON A MONDAY NIGHT?

16:09.499 --> 16:11.201
OH, MY GOD.

16:11.201 --> 16:12.372
WHAT?

16:12.372 --> 16:14.174
YOU THINK THEY'RE COOL.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.346
WELL... YEAH.

16:16.346 --> 16:18.678
NO, I MEAN
YOU THINK THEY'RE COOL

16:18.678 --> 16:21.181
IN THAT YOU WANNA BE THEM.
 OH, PLEASE.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.684
YOU DO! THIS IS TOM,
FORMER HIGH SCHOOL NERD,

16:24.684 --> 16:27.987
LIVING VICARIOUSLY
THROUGH HIS AWESOME-ASS KIDS.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.320
HEY, I WAS PLENTY COOL
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.322
ARE WE REDEFINING "COOL"

16:32.322 --> 16:36.026
TO INCLUDE PLAYING TROMBONE
IN THE MARCHING BAND?

16:36.026 --> 16:38.328
(chuckles) HEY, HEY.

16:38.328 --> 16:40.200
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.502
YOU'RE A LITTLE HIGH-SPIRITED,
BUT I TRUST THEM.

16:42.502 --> 16:46.336
SO I'VE DECIDED TO UNGROUND THEM
FOR THE HOMECOMING DANCE.

16:46.336 --> 16:48.678
BUT I TOLD THEM
THEY COULDN'T GO.

16:48.678 --> 16:53.783
AND YOU TOLD ME TO HANDLE IT,
AND I JUST DID.

16:53.783 --> 16:56.286
OH, BY THE WAY,
IT WASN'T A TROMBONE.

16:56.286 --> 16:58.218
IT WAS A TUBA.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.550
KNOW YOUR BRASS.

17:09.659 --> 17:11.661
(girl) MOM! MOM! WHERE ARE YOU?

17:11.661 --> 17:13.363
(woman) RIGHT HERE, HONEY!

17:13.363 --> 17:17.137
(girls shouting and laughing)

17:17.137 --> 17:18.308
JUANITA!

17:18.308 --> 17:21.141
YOU SAID I COULD HAVE CAKE.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.343
I KNOW, BUT SO MUCH?

17:23.343 --> 17:26.276
YOU COULD'VE GONE BACK
FOR A SECOND PIECE.

17:26.276 --> 17:28.178
(mouth full)
THIS IS MY SECOND PIECE.

17:33.323 --> 17:36.326
(women laugh)

17:36.326 --> 17:38.328
(woman) AND IT'S NOT
JUANITA'S FAULT.

17:38.328 --> 17:40.290
IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION,
I BLAME THE PARENTS.

17:40.290 --> 17:43.293
(woman) LOOK, MY KID WOULD EAT
SUGAR ALL DAY LONG IF I LET HER.

17:43.293 --> 17:46.296
GABY'S OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THOSE
MOMS WHO JUST CAN'T SAY NO.

17:46.296 --> 17:49.299
IT'S A SHAME, TOO.
JUANITA HAS SUCH A PRETTY FACE.

17:49.299 --> 17:50.800
MM.

17:54.644 --> 17:56.646
I'M BACK.

17:56.646 --> 17:59.309
YOU WANT SOMETHING COLD?

17:59.309 --> 18:01.080
WELL, ACTUALLY,

18:01.080 --> 18:03.383
I'M IN THE MOOD
FOR SOMETHING HOT.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.790
YOU KNOW...

18:10.790 --> 18:12.792
THIS IS WHY
IT'S TAKING FOUR MONTHS

18:12.792 --> 18:14.794
TO GET MY HOUSE PAINTED.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.866
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
THAT EXPRESSION,

18:16.866 --> 18:20.200
"YOU CAN HAVE IT DONE FAST,
OR YOU CAN HAVE IT DONE RIGHT"?

18:20.200 --> 18:24.204
I THINK I'LL HAVE IT DONE
RIGHT NOW. (laughs)

18:26.105 --> 18:28.178
(knock on door)
 (Lynette) HEY, SUSAN?

18:28.178 --> 18:31.341
MM. UH, LYNETTE,
IT'S NOT REALLY A GOOD TIME.

18:31.341 --> 18:33.643
I JUST NEED FIVE SECONDS
TO BITCH ABOUT TOM,

18:33.643 --> 18:36.246
AND THEN I'LL--
OH, MY GOD.
 (sighs)

18:36.246 --> 18:39.619
YOUR PAINTER
ISN'T DONE YET?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.791
UH...

18:41.791 --> 18:44.654
YEAH. HE--HE'S HARD
TO KEEP TRACK OF.

18:44.654 --> 18:47.857
WELL, ANYWAY,
TOM REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE

18:47.857 --> 18:51.201
THAT THE TWINS ARE TURNING
INTO JUVENILE DELINQUENTS.

18:51.201 --> 18:55.235
JUST THE OTHER DAY, I WAS--
 OH, YOU POOR THING!
YOU NEED A HUG.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.236
UH...

18:58.308 --> 19:00.170
(sighs)

19:00.170 --> 19:01.911
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?

19:01.911 --> 19:04.744
(leaves rustling)

19:09.249 --> 19:10.880
(camera shutter snaps)

19:10.880 --> 19:12.752
SORRY TO HAVE BARGED IN,

19:12.752 --> 19:15.255
AND THANKS FOR LETTING ME
GET THAT OFF MY CHEST.

19:15.255 --> 19:18.288
HEY, ANYTIME THAT YOU NEED TO
TALK, YOU JUST RING MY BELL...

19:18.288 --> 19:19.589
(chuckles)
 AND WAIT.

19:19.589 --> 19:21.861
OKAY, NEW RULE.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.864
FROM NOW ON, SEX ONLY HAPPENS
IN THE BEDROOM, DOOR CLOSED,

19:24.864 --> 19:27.867
BETWEEN THE HOURS
OF 7:00 AND 10:00 P.M.
 YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:27.867 --> 19:30.870
IT'D BE A HELL OF A LOT EASIER
FOR ME TO FOLLOW THE RULES

19:30.870 --> 19:34.274
IF I KNEW WHY THEY EXISTED.
 I JUST DON'T WANT MY FRIENDS
TO KNOW.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.306
WHY?
YOU--YOU ASHAMED OF ME?

19:36.306 --> 19:39.379
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.251
IT'S JUST... COMPLICATED.

19:41.251 --> 19:43.253
I'M JUST A SIMPLE GUY,

19:43.253 --> 19:46.386
SO I CAN'T BE
YOUR DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.388
I NEED MORE FROM YOU.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.563
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T GIVE THAT TO YOU.

19:55.795 --> 19:59.669
HONEY, I KNOW YOU WANNA GO HOME
AND WATCH YOUR CARTOONS,

19:59.669 --> 20:01.671
BUT YOU HAD A LOT OF CAKE,

20:01.671 --> 20:04.504
SO I WAS THINKING
I'D TAKE YOU TO THE PARK.

20:04.504 --> 20:08.408
THAT WAY, YOU COULD RUN AROUND
AND GET SOME NICE, FUN EXERCISE.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.410
NO.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.541
YOU SURE?

20:11.541 --> 20:13.983
RUNNING AROUND
IN THE SUN AND FRESH AIR

20:13.983 --> 20:15.985
WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD.

20:15.985 --> 20:18.418
MM... NO.

20:18.418 --> 20:19.789
(sighs) OKAY.

20:19.789 --> 20:22.292
WHY DON'T YOU
GO THROW THAT IN THE TRASH?

20:22.292 --> 20:24.824
AND I'M GONNA
GET THE CAR STARTED.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.756
(girls laughing,
rapid footsteps approaching)

20:36.436 --> 20:38.338
HEY, JUANITA.

20:38.338 --> 20:41.411
YOU WANNA PLAY A NEW GAME
ON THE WAY HOME?

20:43.443 --> 20:46.616
(singsong voice)
WINNER GETS A NEW DOLL.
 OKAY.

20:46.616 --> 20:49.349
WELL, COME ON, THEN!

20:53.583 --> 20:55.485
HEY!

21:00.890 --> 21:02.692
MOMMY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:02.692 --> 21:06.666
IT'S A NEW GAME I INVENTED,
AND YOU'RE WINNING 1 TO NOTHING!

21:09.469 --> 21:11.641
(engine revs)

21:16.275 --> 21:17.807
(gasps)

21:17.807 --> 21:19.309
KATHERINE! FANTASTIC NEWS.

21:19.309 --> 21:20.980
"WHAT'S COOKIN' FAIRVIEW?"

21:20.980 --> 21:23.282
IS SENDING OUT
A CAMERA CREW TOMORROW

21:23.282 --> 21:26.656
TO DO A PIECE
ON ME AND THE BOOK.
 OH, WHICH I JUST FINISHED
THIS MORNING.

21:26.656 --> 21:29.659
YOU READ IT ALREADY?
 YES. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.

21:29.659 --> 21:32.662
(thud)
 BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
AT LEAST A DOZEN RECIPES

21:32.662 --> 21:34.694
ARE MISSING
A PRETTY CRUCIAL INGREDIENT.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.396
REALLY?

21:36.396 --> 21:37.567
WHAT?

21:37.567 --> 21:38.998
MY NAME.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.001
EXCUSE ME?
 BREE, YOUR BOOK
IS FILLED WITH RECIPES

21:42.001 --> 21:43.603
THAT WE DEVELOPED TOGETHER,

21:43.603 --> 21:46.836
AND--AND SOME OF THEM
ARE FLAT-OUT MINE.
 OH, DON'T BE SILLY.

21:46.836 --> 21:48.838
I MAY HAVE BASED A FEW
ON YOUR RECIPES,

21:48.838 --> 21:50.640
BUT I ALWAYS
CHANGED SOMETHING.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.342
LIKE WHAT? THE FONT?

21:52.342 --> 21:54.644
NAME ONE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THIS MEATLOAF RECIPE AND MINE.

21:54.644 --> 21:57.347
WELL, YOURS CALLS FOR
MINCED CURLY LEAF PARSLEY.

21:57.347 --> 21:59.349
MINE CALLS FOR
MINCED FLAT LEAF.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.621
IT'S MINCED!
WHO CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE?

22:01.621 --> 22:04.954
BREE, YOU HAVE RECIPES IN HERE
YOU CAN'T EVEN MAKE.

22:04.954 --> 22:06.456
NEVER HEARD ANYTHING
SO ABSURD.

22:06.456 --> 22:09.659
THE CROQUEMBOUCHE CAKE
WITH THE SPUN SUGAR NETTING?

22:09.659 --> 22:12.331
I'VE NEVER ONCE SEEN YOU
WORK WITH MOLTEN SUGAR.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.103
I ALWAYS MAKE THAT CAKE.
 REALLY, KATHERINE.

22:14.103 --> 22:17.106
JUST BECAUSE I LET YOU EXECUTE
A FEW EYE-CATCHING GARNISHES

22:17.106 --> 22:19.739
THAT GRATIFY YOUR NEED
TO SHOW OFF,

22:19.739 --> 22:22.642
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I CAN'T
DO THEM JUST AS WELL MYSELF.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.343
YOU LET ME?

22:24.343 --> 22:25.375
(thud)

22:25.375 --> 22:27.377
I THOUGHT WE WERE PARTNERS.

22:27.377 --> 22:29.719
WE ARE.

22:29.719 --> 22:32.422
THAT'S WHY YOUR NAME IS
ON THE DEDICATION PAGE.

22:34.584 --> 22:37.587
YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE DEDICATION, BREE.

22:37.587 --> 22:41.431
IT REALLY WAS
THE LEAST YOU COULD DO.

22:41.431 --> 22:43.533
(door shuts)

22:46.065 --> 22:47.397
WOW!

22:47.397 --> 22:49.639
18 TO ZERO!

22:49.639 --> 22:51.671
2 MORE POINTS,
AND YOU'LL BREAK THE RECORD.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.404
MOMMY, I'M TIRED!
 (engine revving)

22:54.404 --> 22:55.475
REALLY?

22:55.475 --> 22:57.807
WELL, I THOUGHT RUNNING
THROUGH THAT GUY'S SPRINKLER

22:57.807 --> 22:59.809
WOULD'VE REFRESHED YOU.
NOW COME ON!

22:59.809 --> 23:01.380
NO.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.582
(engine revs)
 (singsong voice) UH-OH.

23:02.582 --> 23:06.716
LOOKS LIKE MOMMY'S
GONNA SCORE HER FIRST 2 POINTS.

23:06.716 --> 23:08.387
COME ON, JUANITA.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.520
SHOW MOMMY
WHAT A WINNER YOU ARE.

23:19.829 --> 23:21.931
JUANITA!

23:21.931 --> 23:24.133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

23:24.133 --> 23:26.405
JUANITA, STOP!

23:39.148 --> 23:41.621
JUANITA! JUANITA!

23:49.128 --> 23:50.800
AND WHILE I THOUGHT

23:50.800 --> 23:52.802
GROUNDING YOU
 WAS AN APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT,

23:52.802 --> 23:54.433
YOUR DAD CONVINCED ME

23:54.433 --> 23:56.936
I WAS BEING
A LITTLE TOO HARD ON YOU GUYS.
 ABSOLUTELY.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.938
AND SO WE HAVE DECIDED

23:58.938 --> 24:01.471
TO LET YOU GO TO
THE HOMECOMING DANCE TONIGHT...

24:01.471 --> 24:03.943
THAT'S RIGHT! (laughs)

24:03.943 --> 24:06.646
IN YOUR FATHER'S CONVERTIBLE.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.648
UM, UM, H-H-HOLD ON.
WHAT? WH--

24:08.648 --> 24:10.820
COME ON, TOM.
I MEAN, WE TRUST THEM, RIGHT?

24:10.820 --> 24:12.922
YES, YES.

24:12.922 --> 24:16.225
I-I WOULD TRUST THEM MORE
IF THEY WERE DRIVING YOUR CAR.
 NO! YOU DON'T WANT

24:16.225 --> 24:19.228
TWO COOL KIDS PULLING UP
TO HOMECOMING IN A MOM CAR,

24:19.228 --> 24:22.031
ESPECIALLY WITH THAT BIG DENT
THEY PUT IN IT LAST MONTH.

24:22.031 --> 24:23.533
HERE YOU GO.

24:23.533 --> 24:25.535
(Preston) DUDE!
 THANKS! THANKS!

24:25.535 --> 24:27.537
DON'T THANK ME.
THANK YOUR FATHER.
 (Preston) THANKS, DAD!

24:27.537 --> 24:31.200
(Porter) YOU ROCK!
 UH, YOU--WHOA! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!
WHOA! HERE--SOME GROUND RULES.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.903
N-NO MUDDY SHOES
ON MY FLOOR MATS. NO--

24:33.903 --> 24:36.475
TOM, RELAX!

24:36.475 --> 24:40.479
YOU HIGH-SPIRITED KIDS DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO HAVE FUN.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.081
HEY! (laughs)
 (laughs)

24:42.081 --> 24:45.154
WHOO! I'M DRIVING IT, MAN.

24:45.154 --> 24:48.518
(man)
AND IN THREE, TWO, ONE.

24:48.518 --> 24:50.520
WELCOME BACK
TO "WHAT'S COOKIN' FAIRVIEW?"

24:50.520 --> 24:52.522
WE'RE TALKING
WITH BREE VAN DE KAMP,

24:52.522 --> 24:53.823
FAIRVIEW'S PREMIER CATERER,

24:53.823 --> 24:56.495
WHO'S ABOUT TO PUBLISH
HER VERY FIRST COOKBOOK.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.798
(man) BREE,
COULD YOU SHOW US INSIDE?

24:58.798 --> 25:01.100
THIS IS MY KITCHEN,

25:01.100 --> 25:03.102
AND THIS IS MY STAFF--

25:03.102 --> 25:06.505
THE MOST GIFTED,
HARDWORKING TEAM

25:06.505 --> 25:08.738
A COOK
COULD EVER HAVE HOPED FOR.

25:08.738 --> 25:11.110
I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS
ABOUT THEM.

25:11.110 --> 25:14.113
SO WHICH ONE OF YOU HAS
WORKED WITH BREE THE LONGEST?

25:14.113 --> 25:15.785
THAT WOULD BE ME.

25:15.785 --> 25:19.188
SO TELL ME, WHAT'S IT
REALLY LIKE WORKING WITH BREE?

25:19.188 --> 25:22.251
(sighs)

25:22.251 --> 25:24.253
IT'S INSPIRING.

25:24.253 --> 25:26.025
(sighs and chuckles)

25:26.025 --> 25:28.527
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
SHE CAN'T DO.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.199
KATHERINE, I'M BLUSHING.

25:30.199 --> 25:33.202
WORKING WITH HER
HAS BEEN...

25:33.202 --> 25:36.205
SUCH AN EDUCATION

25:36.205 --> 25:37.867
THAT I--AAH!

25:37.867 --> 25:40.269
AH! (inhales sharply)
 OH, GOD. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

25:40.269 --> 25:43.242
I THINK I STRAINED MY WRIST.
GOD, IT HURTS.

25:43.242 --> 25:46.245
OH, YOU POOR DEAR. COULD SOMEONE
PLEASE GET SOME ICE? OH, NO.

25:46.245 --> 25:49.919
OH, AND I WAS JUST ABOUT TO PUT
THE SPUN SUGAR NETTING

25:49.919 --> 25:52.922
ON OUR FAMOUS CROQUEMBOUCHE.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.186
WOULD YOU MIND DOING IT?

25:57.186 --> 25:59.729
(chuckles nervously)
KATHERINE,

25:59.729 --> 26:02.832
I'M SURE YOUR WRIST
IS JUST FINE.

26:02.832 --> 26:05.334
NO, IT'S REALLY THROBBING.

26:05.334 --> 26:09.268
OKAY, IT LOOKS LIKE BREE
TO THE RESCUE.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.601
BE SURE YOU GET THIS.

26:11.601 --> 26:13.302
REALLY SOMETHING TO SEE.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.680
THE SECRET TO SPINNING SUGAR

26:20.680 --> 26:22.351
IS THIS SPECIAL WHISK

26:22.351 --> 26:24.353
THAT MAKES
LOVELY GOSSAMER THREADS.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.862
CAREFUL, DEAR.

26:32.862 --> 26:35.364
YOU'RE CLUMPING.
 I CAN SEE THAT.

26:35.364 --> 26:37.326
AAH!
 (man) WHOA!

26:37.326 --> 26:38.668
(gasps)

26:38.668 --> 26:40.199
THAT STUFF'S HOT!

26:40.199 --> 26:41.971
SORRY.

26:41.971 --> 26:43.372
(laughs)

26:43.372 --> 26:45.805
OOPS! (laughs nervously)

26:50.109 --> 26:51.310
(sighs)

26:51.310 --> 26:54.313
SO THAT'S YOUR IDEA OF EXERCISE?
HAVING HER RUN AFTER A CAR?

26:54.313 --> 26:57.016
CARLOS, OUR DAUGHTER
SUCKED DOWN HALF A SHEET CAKE,

26:57.016 --> 26:59.218
AND AFTERWARDS,
NO ONE COULD FIND THE CANDLES.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.290
WAKE UP!
WE HAVE GOT A PROBLEM!

27:01.290 --> 27:04.293
I JUST DON'T THINK THE SOLUTION
IS TO HUMILIATE HER.

27:04.293 --> 27:06.295
NOW EVEN IF SHE'S... HEAVY,

27:06.295 --> 27:09.298
DOESN'T SHE HAVE THE RIGHT
TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT HERSELF?

27:09.298 --> 27:12.261
HEY, I'M PROTECTING HER.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW THE TRUTH YET.

27:12.261 --> 27:15.264
WOMEN ONLY HAVE FIVE SECONDS
TO BE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL,

27:15.264 --> 27:17.266
AND THEN IT'S GONE.
 (sighs)

27:17.266 --> 27:21.110
AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
WE'RE OLD AND FAT AND MARRIED

27:21.110 --> 27:23.112
AND WONDERING
WHERE OUR BEAUTY WENT.

27:23.112 --> 27:24.243
(sighs) GABY...

27:24.243 --> 27:26.245
(voice breaks)
NO, CARLOS. I MEAN...

27:26.245 --> 27:28.718
SOMETIMES I'M GLAD
YOU CAN'T SEE ME.

27:28.718 --> 27:31.220
FIVE YEARS AND TWO KIDS

27:31.220 --> 27:33.222
AND NO TIME
FOR FACIALS OR THE GYM.

27:33.222 --> 27:35.124
IT JUST... TAKES A TOLL.

27:37.687 --> 27:39.729
(sighs)

27:39.729 --> 27:42.231
AND WHEN EDIE SAW ME
THE OTHER DAY,

27:42.231 --> 27:44.734
IT WAS LIKE SHE DIDN'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE ME.

27:44.734 --> 27:47.066
LISTEN TO ME.

27:49.168 --> 27:52.301
NOBODY KNOWS YOUR FACE
BETTER THAN I DO.
 (sniffles)

27:52.301 --> 27:54.673
AND I SEE IT
EVERY TIME I KISS YOU.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.675
IN 5 YEARS OR 50,

27:56.675 --> 28:01.050
YOU WILL
ALWAYS BE BEAUTIFUL.

28:01.050 --> 28:03.953
HEAR ME?

28:06.385 --> 28:08.387
AND NOW TO FINISH,

28:08.387 --> 28:12.121
YOU SIMPLY TRANSFER
YOUR SPUN SUGAR

28:12.121 --> 28:13.763
TO THE CROQUEMBOUCHE

28:13.763 --> 28:16.425
AND GRACEFULLY DRAPE IT AROUND

28:16.425 --> 28:20.129
IN A DELICATE SWIRL.

28:23.272 --> 28:24.834
OH. (chuckles)

28:24.834 --> 28:26.836
DID I MENTION THAT YOU...
(scoffs)

28:26.836 --> 28:28.838
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
BE WEARING JEWELRY

28:28.838 --> 28:32.041
WHILE WORKING
WITH SPUN SUGAR? UM...

28:37.446 --> 28:40.319
WELL, THERE'S NO LAW THAT SAYS
IT HAS TO BE A DELICATE VEIL.

28:40.319 --> 28:43.022
I MEAN, IT COULD REALLY
JUST BE A BEAUTIFUL, UM,

28:43.022 --> 28:46.225
LITTLE, UH, WHITE...

28:46.225 --> 28:47.296
RIBBON.

28:49.298 --> 28:51.300
TURN OFF THE DAMN CAMERA.

28:51.300 --> 28:54.403
AH, ACTUALLY, MY WRIST
IS FEELING A LITTLE BETTER.

28:54.403 --> 28:56.906
WHY DON'T I GIVE IT A SHOT?

29:02.371 --> 29:04.173
(beeps)

29:05.474 --> 29:07.416
WHATCHA DOING?

29:07.416 --> 29:12.051
OKAY, WHERE ARE THEY?
IT'S 30 MINUTES PAST CURFEW.

29:12.051 --> 29:13.883
ACTUALLY, IT'S 32.

29:13.883 --> 29:16.385
IF THERE IS A SINGLE SCRATCH
ON THAT CAR--

29:16.385 --> 29:20.229
I MEAN, AFTER ALL THE TIME THAT
I SPENT RESTORING THAT THING...

29:20.229 --> 29:23.532
YEAH. REMEMBER WHEN YOU SPENT
THE ENTIRE DAY ON THE INTERNET

29:23.532 --> 29:26.365
TRYING TO FIND
A NEW GEARSHIFT KNOB?

29:26.365 --> 29:28.367
WORST ANNIVERSARY EVER.

29:28.367 --> 29:31.370
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU DID THIS TO ME.

29:31.370 --> 29:32.501
I KNOW.

29:32.501 --> 29:36.075
THAT CAR IS YOUR BABY.

29:36.075 --> 29:40.279
IF ONLY THERE WAS SOMETHING
 I FELT THAT INTENSELY ABOUT.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.912
OH, WAIT! THERE IS--
MY ACTUAL BABIES.

29:42.912 --> 29:46.355
YOU THINK I DON'T CARE
ABOUT OUR BOYS?

29:46.355 --> 29:48.357
I KNOW YOU LOVE THEM,

29:48.357 --> 29:50.860
BUT SOMETIMES YOU FIND THEM
SO COOL AND ENTERTAINING,

29:50.860 --> 29:52.822
YOU FORGET TO PARENT THEM.

29:52.822 --> 29:54.864
LYNETTE--
 NO, LISTEN.

29:54.864 --> 29:58.527
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

29:58.527 --> 30:01.230
WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE
AND THEY'D ACT OUT,

30:01.230 --> 30:03.532
AND WE'D ALWAYS SAY,
"RELAX! THEY'RE YOUNG.

30:03.532 --> 30:05.534
WHEN THEY'RE OLDER,
THEY'LL GET IT."

30:05.534 --> 30:08.537
WELL, TOM, THEY'RE 16 NOW.

30:08.537 --> 30:11.240
NOT GETTING IT.

30:11.240 --> 30:15.044
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO
IN A VERY SHORT TIME,

30:15.044 --> 30:17.246
AND IF YOU AND I
AREN'T IN SYNC,

30:17.246 --> 30:19.248
I'M AFRAID
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

30:20.589 --> 30:23.592
(car approaching)

30:25.925 --> 30:27.596
(brakes squeal)

30:27.596 --> 30:29.598
(boys laughing)

30:29.598 --> 30:32.461
(engine shuts off, doors open)

30:32.461 --> 30:36.265
HEY, SORRY WE'RE LATE.
 YEAH. BUT, DAD,
YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS STORY.

30:36.265 --> 30:39.138
WE JUST PULLED UP
AT AN INTERSECTION,

30:39.138 --> 30:42.141
AND THERE WERE
THESE TWO HOT GIRLS--
 I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

30:42.141 --> 30:44.413
YOU EVER HEAR OF A THING
CALLED A CELL PHONE?

30:44.413 --> 30:46.515
WE'RE ONLY, LIKE,
35 MINUTES LATE.

30:46.515 --> 30:48.517
YEAH, 35 MINUTES,
DURING WHICH TIME

30:48.517 --> 30:51.150
YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAVE BEEN WORRIED SICK.

30:51.150 --> 30:52.922
BUT, DAD--

30:52.922 --> 30:55.454
YOU BROKE THE RULES.
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.

30:57.326 --> 30:59.528
YOU'RE BOTH GROUNDED
FOR A MONTH.

30:59.528 --> 31:01.590
THIS SUCKS!
YOU'RE ONLY DOING THIS

31:01.590 --> 31:04.293
'CAUSE YOU WERE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR PRECIOUS CAR.

31:04.293 --> 31:06.595
YOU THINK?
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

31:08.237 --> 31:09.438

31:14.243 --> 31:16.575

34:04.643 --> 34:07.716
♪ WHAT DO YOU SAY? ♪

34:07.716 --> 34:11.350
♪ DO YOU LOVE ME, BABE? ♪

34:11.350 --> 34:12.781
♪ WHAT CAN I SAY? ♪

34:12.781 --> 34:14.523
(electricity powers down)

34:14.523 --> 34:17.456
(all moan)
 (woman) DIDN'T THEY PAY
THE BILL?

34:17.456 --> 34:20.429
ALL RIGHT. CALM DOWN.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

34:20.429 --> 34:22.761
(whispers)
YOU, COME WITH ME.

34:22.761 --> 34:25.164
(sighs)

34:25.164 --> 34:28.437
WHY WOULD YOU HUMILIATE ME
IN FRONT OF MY FRIENDS?

34:28.437 --> 34:30.099
ARE YOU A LUNATIC?

34:30.099 --> 34:32.400
I-I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET THROUGH TO YOU.
 (scoffs)

34:32.400 --> 34:35.304
AND, YEAH, IT'S MAKING ME
KINDA CRAZY.

34:35.304 --> 34:39.148
SUSAN... WHY CAN'T I MEET
YOUR FRIENDS?

34:39.148 --> 34:41.449
I MEAN, AM I REALLY
 THAT HORRIBLE?

34:41.449 --> 34:44.253
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
MY FRIENDS WOULD LOVE YOU.

34:44.253 --> 34:46.415
THEN WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

34:46.415 --> 34:48.085
THE PROBLEM IS,

34:48.085 --> 34:51.089
IF YOU MEET MY FRIENDS,
THEN WE'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP,

34:51.089 --> 34:53.492
AND I CAN'T BE
IN A RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.793
BUT I-I PROMISE,
I'LL MAKE YOU VERY HAPPY.

34:55.793 --> 34:59.768
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T DESERVE
TO BE HAPPY.

34:59.768 --> 35:01.830
(both sigh)

35:07.336 --> 35:08.637
UM...

35:14.183 --> 35:17.216
A FEW YEARS AGO...

35:17.216 --> 35:20.449
THERE WAS
THIS CAR ACCIDENT...

35:20.449 --> 35:23.452
A BAD ONE.

35:23.452 --> 35:25.324
TAKE THE HIGH ROAD?

35:25.324 --> 35:27.626
DID YOU HEAR WHAT
THOSE SMUG BITCHES SAID TO ME?

35:27.626 --> 35:29.628
EDIE, IT'S IMPORTANT
THESE PEOPLE LIKE US.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.630
IT'S OUR HOME NOW.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.633
I NEVER SHOULD'VE LET YOU
TALK ME INTO MOVING BACK HERE.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.636
WHY? WHY WERE YOU
SO GUNG HO ON WISTERIA LANE?

35:37.636 --> 35:40.539
LISTEN TO YOUR HUSBAND.
WE CAN BE HAPPY HERE,

35:40.539 --> 35:43.572
BUT WE NEED THESE PEOPLE
TO LIKE US.

35:43.572 --> 35:45.214
WHY?

35:47.346 --> 35:50.319
IT'LL JUST
MAKE EVERYTHING EASIER.

35:52.521 --> 35:54.223
THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

35:54.223 --> 35:56.425
SUSAN, YOU CAN'T
FEEL GUILTY ABOUT IT.

35:56.425 --> 35:58.427
YOU KNOW WHAT, JACKSON?
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING

35:58.427 --> 36:00.489
I HAVEN'T ALREADY HEARD
A MILLION TIMES.

36:00.489 --> 36:03.362
I-I ONLY TOLD YOU
BECAUSE I...

36:03.362 --> 36:05.364
I JUST
WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND

36:05.364 --> 36:07.436
WHY I CAN'T
LET YOU IN MY LIFE.

36:09.898 --> 36:12.471
WELL... (sighs)

36:12.471 --> 36:15.704
DO YOU MIND IF I HANG OUT
FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS

36:15.704 --> 36:18.707
AND SEE IF
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

36:21.650 --> 36:24.353
YEAH, I GUESS
I COULD HANDLE THAT.

36:26.785 --> 36:29.818
(cheers and applause)

36:29.818 --> 36:32.361
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU...

36:32.361 --> 36:34.363
GO HAVE FUN
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

36:34.363 --> 36:36.565
AND JUST CALL ME
WHEN YOU'RE FREE.

36:36.565 --> 36:38.267
OKAY.

36:42.901 --> 36:45.904
(liquid bubbling)

36:59.488 --> 37:02.951
(voice breaks) PLEASE, DANIELLE.
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TAKE HIM.

37:02.951 --> 37:04.953
I HAVE EVERY RIGHT.
HE'S MY KID.

37:04.953 --> 37:06.955
DANIELLE,
WE AGREED I WOULD RAISE HIM.

37:06.955 --> 37:08.957
WE AGREED
IT WOULD BE BEST!

37:08.957 --> 37:11.960
YOU SAID IT WOULD BE BEST!
 I'VE HAD NO SAY IN ANYTHING!

37:11.960 --> 37:14.263
BUT I AM MARRIED NOW,
AND LEO'S A LAWYER.

37:14.263 --> 37:17.736
SO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR
AND DON'T TRY TO FIGHT THIS!

37:17.736 --> 37:20.569
PLEASE, DANIELLE, WE CAN HAVE
ANY ARRANGEMENT YOU LIKE.

37:20.569 --> 37:22.571
PLEASE, JUST DON'T TAKE HIM!

37:22.571 --> 37:25.514
FOR GOD SAKES, ORSON'S GONE.

37:25.514 --> 37:27.916
YOU KIDS ARE GROWN.
BENJAMIN'S ALL I HAVE!

37:27.916 --> 37:31.450
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING ELSE.

37:35.284 --> 37:37.586
HONEY, COME TO BED.
IT'S AFTER 2:00.

37:37.586 --> 37:39.588
(closes drawer)

37:41.590 --> 37:44.293
THE COOKING SHOW
AGREED TO REDO MY SEGMENT.

37:44.293 --> 37:47.396
I WANNA MAKE SURE
IT'S PERFECT THIS TIME.

37:47.396 --> 37:50.399
WELL, I WON'T TELL YOU
HOW TO RUN YOUR BUSINESS.

37:50.399 --> 37:52.871
IT'S YOUR BABY.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.506
(sighs) YES, IT IS.

38:17.626 --> 38:19.898
(horn honks, tires screech)

38:21.800 --> 38:23.802
(loud crash)

38:33.642 --> 38:36.445
(speaks inaudibly)

38:42.421 --> 38:44.953
HEY. UM, M.J. READY?

38:44.953 --> 38:47.596
YEAH, HE'S UPSTAIRS
WAITING FOR YOU.

38:51.600 --> 38:54.663
I TOLD YOU
THE BRAKES WERE SQUEAKING.

38:54.663 --> 38:57.666
I ASKED YOU
TO GET THEM CHECKED.
 AND I CHECKED 'EM!

38:57.666 --> 38:59.668
I MEANT A MECHANIC...
 (scoffs)

38:59.668 --> 39:01.740
NOT YOU.
 IT WAS NOT THE BRAKES, SUSAN.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.842
IF IT HAD BEEN,
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MATTERED.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.845
THEY CRASHED INTO US!
 AND WE KILLED THEM, MIKE!

39:06.845 --> 39:09.618
WE DIDN'T KILL THEM!
THEY DIED.

39:09.618 --> 39:11.620
THEY WERE
A MOTHER AND A CHILD.

39:11.620 --> 39:13.622
SHE WAS A MOTHER,
JUST LIKE ME...

39:13.622 --> 39:15.624
(voice breaks)
WITH A CHILD JUST LIKE OURS.

39:15.624 --> 39:18.086
AND IF IT WEREN'T FOR US,
THEY WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.

39:18.086 --> 39:20.589
YEAH, WE HAVE BEEN
OVER AND OVER THIS, SUSAN.

39:20.589 --> 39:24.092
IT'S--IT'S LIKE
YOU WANT TO SUFFER.
 IT'S LIKE
YOU DON'T CARE AT ALL,

39:24.092 --> 39:26.595
LIKE YOU FEEL NOTHING
 FOR THOSE PEOPLE.

39:26.595 --> 39:29.638
I CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN!
I JUST CAN'T!

39:31.039 --> 39:33.842
(door slams)

39:36.505 --> 39:38.877
HEY. DID YOU PACK
YOUR DINOSAUR BOOK

39:38.877 --> 39:42.010
SO YOU CAN READ IT
WITH YOUR DADDY?
 SURE DID.

39:42.010 --> 39:43.812
OH, GOOD. MMM.

39:43.812 --> 39:46.384
OKAY, YOU HAVE FUN,
SWEETIE.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.989
SO, UM, I'LL PROBABLY BRING HIM
BACK SUNDAY AROUND 6:00 OR SO.

39:50.989 --> 39:52.521
FINE.

39:54.623 --> 39:57.526
WELL, HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND.
DOING ANYTHING SPECIAL?

39:59.928 --> 40:02.701
WELL, I'VE SORT OF
STARTED SEEING SOMEONE.

40:05.534 --> 40:07.576
SO I MIGHT DO SOMETHING
WITH HIM.

40:09.778 --> 40:11.640
GOOD FOR YOU.

40:18.517 --> 40:19.818
(whispers) YEAH.

40:23.522 --> 40:27.195
IT GOES BY SO QUICKLY.

40:27.195 --> 40:29.197
IN A FLASH,

40:29.197 --> 40:32.060
THE LIFE WE KNEW
IS GONE FOREVER.

40:32.060 --> 40:37.035
AND WE'RE LEFT
TO ASK OURSELVES...

40:37.035 --> 40:39.538
HOW COULD HE HAVE LEFT ME?

40:43.642 --> 40:48.617
WHEN DID MY BEAUTY
START TO FADE?

40:48.617 --> 40:51.950
WHY HAS MY FRIEND CHANGED?

40:58.186 --> 41:01.229
WAS I THE BEST MOTHER
I COULD HAVE BEEN?

41:03.692 --> 41:06.595
OF COURSE,
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE

41:06.595 --> 41:10.238
WHO UNDERSTAND
HOW QUICKLY TIME PASSES.

41:12.571 --> 41:13.872
(cell phone ringing)

41:13.872 --> 41:15.874
THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE SO DETERMINED

41:15.874 --> 41:18.246
TO GET WHAT THEY WANT

41:18.246 --> 41:21.610
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

41:23.512 --> 41:24.683
(cell phone beeps)

41:24.683 --> 41:27.616
OH, DR. HELLER.
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO CALL YOU.

41:27.616 --> 41:29.618
YEAH,
I WAS GETTING CONCERNED.

41:29.618 --> 41:32.190
YOU'RE REQUIRED
TO CHECK IN ONCE A MONTH.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.693
IT WAS A CONDITION
OF YOUR RELEASE.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.695
OH, COME ON.
THAT WAS A YEAR AGO.

41:36.695 --> 41:39.528
BUT TO BE HONEST,
THE MEDS ARE WORKING SO WELL,

41:39.528 --> 41:42.030
I KINDA FORGOT ABOUT YOU.
NO OFFENSE.

41:42.030 --> 41:44.803
DAVE, ONCE A MONTH.
NOT OPTIONAL.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.675
MESSAGE RECEIVED, DOC.

41:46.675 --> 41:49.678
BUT SERIOUSLY, YOU DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT ME. I'M GREAT.

41:49.678 --> 41:52.510
I'LL TALK TO YOU
IN A MONTH.
 (shuts cell phone)

41:59.988 --> 42:01.790
(click)
 JUST TELL ME.

42:01.790 --> 42:04.192
WHAT ARE THE MAGIC WORDS
THAT I'VE GOTTA SAY

42:04.192 --> 42:07.195
SO YOU WILL
LET ME OUT OF HERE?
 (Dr. Heller) DAVE,
YOU'VE BEEN HERE SIX WEEKS,

42:07.195 --> 42:09.758
AND YOU DON'T SEEM
ANY CLOSER

42:09.758 --> 42:13.101
TO COMING TO TERMS
WITH YOUR RAGE.
 I'VE COME TO TERMS WITH IT,

42:13.101 --> 42:15.103
AND I LIKE IT
JUST THE WAY IT IS.

42:15.103 --> 42:17.105
THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED
BECAUSE YOU AGREED

42:17.105 --> 42:19.107
TO PUT YOURSELF
IN A DOCTOR'S CARE.

42:19.107 --> 42:21.069
I'M NOT GOING TO
AUTHORIZE YOUR RELEASE

42:21.069 --> 42:23.071
UNTIL I SEE
SOME REAL PROGRESS.

42:23.071 --> 42:25.614
WH-WHAT'S PROGRESS SUPPOSED
TO LOOK LIKE TO YOU, DOC?

42:25.614 --> 42:28.617
I MEAN, SHOULD I JUST PLASTER
SOME FAKE SMILE ON MY FACE

42:28.617 --> 42:30.619
AND PRETEND THIS--THIS THING
THAT'S INSIDE ME

42:30.619 --> 42:32.250
ISN'T EATIN' ME ALIVE?

42:32.250 --> 42:35.253
'CAUSE I CAN DO THAT
IF YOU WANT.
 I NEED TO MAKE SURE

42:35.253 --> 42:37.756
YOU'RE NOT A DANGER
TO YOURSELF OR TO OTHERS.

42:37.756 --> 42:40.759
LISTEN, I'VE NEVER BEEN
A DANGER TO MYSELF.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.632
AND AS FAR AS THE OTHERS
ARE CONCERNED,

42:43.632 --> 42:46.795
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
WHO SHOULD BE WORRIED.
