How's my little Liberace getting on?
Come on.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.353
Joshy!

00:28.560 --> 00:29.595
Josh!

00:36.040 --> 00:37.712
<i>Joshy!</i>

00:38.680 --> 00:40.432
<i>Josh!</i>

00:40.520 --> 00:42.670
He no here! Unless he with David.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.716
No, David's gone to get a paper.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.436
Hello! Hey, look.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.999
Hello?

00:52.080 --> 00:53.672
Yes. It's for you.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.719
<i>I think I don't love you any more.</i>

01:24.760 --> 01:27.069
<i>Come on, love.</i>

01:27.160 --> 01:30.436
What are you doing in there, writing a book?

01:30.520 --> 01:32.476
Why do you leave these things here?

01:32.560 --> 01:34.516
Josh!

01:35.840 --> 01:37.796
Joshy!

01:37.880 --> 01:40.599
No.

01:46.200 --> 01:50.637
Ramona, think where else he could be hiding.
- I don't know. I look everywhere!

01:51.640 --> 01:53.995
Morning.
- Josh!

01:54.080 --> 01:56.036
Hello, darling.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.589
What?

02:04.640 --> 02:06.915
What the hell were you thinking of, David?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.639
I'm not allowed to take my son
to the newsagent?

02:09.720 --> 02:13.349
I'm sorry. Of course you are.
It's just that you haven't done it before.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.396
Well, it's high time I got started.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.197
Do you know,
I can't even remember Wee Willie Winkie.

02:21.280 --> 02:22.713
How does it go?

02:22.800 --> 02:26.634
He runs through the town, upstairs
downstairs, in his nightgown. Then what?

02:26.720 --> 02:28.392
What's brought this on?

02:28.480 --> 02:30.436
No, that's not right.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.714
Knocking at the window,
peeping through the lock.

02:34.800 --> 02:37.519
Are the children all in bed,
cos it's past eight o'clock!

02:37.600 --> 02:38.919
I'm late.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.673
Joshy, darling, be good for Ramona, yeah?

02:41.760 --> 02:43.716
And Daddy.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.472
Bye, darling.
- Bye.

02:50.800 --> 02:53.917
David, are you going to start calling
head-hunters today?

02:54.000 --> 02:55.956
Oh, maybe. Maybe.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.596
Yeah, all right, all right.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.676
Bye.
- Bye.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.953
Hey, Josh! Colouring time.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.678
So, how was your evening?

03:11.760 --> 03:13.671
Well, um... Eventful.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.955
But nothing like that.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.996
God! Abortion!

03:19.760 --> 03:21.591
But I saw her with a baby.

03:21.680 --> 03:24.752
The one that looked Chinese?
It belonged to a friend of Karen's.

03:26.920 --> 03:27.989
Japanese.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.354
Oh, so I was close.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.396
Not in thinking it was Rachel's, no.

03:33.160 --> 03:36.072
Oh, Jesus.
- Is that all you can say?

03:36.160 --> 03:38.116
What else is there to say?

03:39.600 --> 03:40.589
Jesus!

03:40.680 --> 03:42.398
Change the record.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.276
I'm sorry. Sorry.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.310
So why was your evening eventful?
- What?

03:53.240 --> 03:55.959
You said you had an eventful evening.
- Oh, yeah.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.559
Why?

03:59.640 --> 04:01.710
Oh, it's nothing.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.676
<i>Hello! Hello, tiger.</i>

04:10.080 --> 04:12.753
What are you doing here?
- We came to meet you.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.870
Why?
- Thought you might like it.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.476
Shall we go home, then?

04:32.360 --> 04:34.794
Pete, I'm sorry about
what I said last night.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.876
What was that, Jen?

04:37.960 --> 04:40.235
I'd had a bit to drink. It just slipped out.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.155
So you're telling me now you didn't mean it?

04:45.240 --> 04:47.470
Yeah!
- Oh.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.916
Liar!

04:51.000 --> 04:52.956
Pete, I just phrased it badly.

04:53.040 --> 04:56.953
You couldn't have phrased it any better.
You had no doubt what you meant.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.590
It's the time of the month.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.636
Look, I don't want to discuss it.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.513
Look, it's my period. You know what
I'm like. - Jen, I don't want to discuss it!

05:15.040 --> 05:16.519
Heard from Adam?

05:16.600 --> 05:18.875
Saw him at lunch time.
- Oh, yeah. And?

05:20.560 --> 05:22.869
Rachel's had an abortion.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.950
Wait a minute. You saw her baby.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.439
No. It wasn't hers.

05:28.520 --> 05:31.034
Oh, my... Really? An abortion?
- Yeah.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.599
Oh, my God.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.159
Really?
- Yeah.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.196
He'll be gutted.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.236
God.

05:38.320 --> 05:41.756
He's probably still at the office.
There you go, hold him. Hold him.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.391
OK, give him his tea. If I'm not back,
put him to bed. All right, love? Thanks.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.276
And I thought you'd come to see me.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.276
Hi.
- Hi.

06:03.480 --> 06:06.153
You haven't been moping all day, have you?
- No.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.436
Most of it.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.790
Ramona's been doing her best to distract me.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.836
Ah, Karen! You are home.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.993
David no home. Joshy no home.
And I am no very happy.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.799
He no have his lunch today.
I make him a Spanish omelette.

06:22.880 --> 06:25.633
Delicious.
- He no have his biscuit this afternoon.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.280
A chocolate bourbon.
- A nanny with no child is...

06:28.360 --> 06:31.432
Is like a fish without a bicycle.
- ... is no nanny!

06:31.520 --> 06:33.272
No, no, no. Is no right. No.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.114
If David, he want to be a nanny,
let him go and train for four year, OK?

06:37.200 --> 06:38.918
All right, Ramona, I take your point.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.230
I don't even know
if I should run his bath any more.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.992
I said I take your point.

06:43.080 --> 06:46.231
Where are they?
- David took him for a quarter pounder.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.912
I haven't seen him since.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.313
David, where are you?

06:50.400 --> 06:53.517
Hello, darling. I'm with Josh. And a donkey.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.433
Sorry, darling, you're breaking up.
I thought you said donkey!

06:56.520 --> 06:57.999
That's right. On the beach.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.435
What beach?
- Blackpool.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.080
David, it's six o'clock!
- Good grief, is it? Um...

07:03.160 --> 07:05.799
Right, well, tell Ramona
not to bother with tea.

07:05.880 --> 07:09.077
Joshy and I will get chips
on the motorway, OK? Bye.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.310
Ah, this is fun, Josh, isn't it?

07:11.400 --> 07:13.709
OK, once more round and then we'll go home.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.950
What is it? What happen? Where are they?

07:16.040 --> 07:17.871
Blackpool.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.712
Blackpool?

07:21.600 --> 07:23.591
Are you going to see her again?

07:23.680 --> 07:25.955
Yeah. I mean, not like that.

07:27.520 --> 07:29.476
No, it's over between us.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.632
Too much history.

07:33.760 --> 07:35.716
Time to move on.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.708
Well, you've always got the lovely Amy, eh?

07:40.800 --> 07:42.916
Oh, yeah!
- Yeah!

07:43.960 --> 07:45.916
That's not serious, you know.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.076
She's just company.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.558
Listen, how did you find Pete at lunch time?

07:55.640 --> 07:57.596
Pete? Same as usual - in the pub.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.352
I'm so funny.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.316
I mean, was he all right?

08:02.400 --> 08:05.472
Wasn't upset or weird or anything?

08:05.560 --> 08:07.516
I mean, he's always weird but...

08:07.600 --> 08:09.830
Um...no. What's he got to be upset about?

08:10.920 --> 08:12.876
Something I said.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.957
You didn't ask him how he can live
with himself, did you?

08:19.440 --> 08:21.590
No. I told him I didn't love him any more.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.636
Oh.

08:25.800 --> 08:27.552
What?

08:27.640 --> 08:29.596
He never said anything about that.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.910
I told him everything about me.
I laid myself bare.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.514
That's not what friends do.
Friends don't do that.

08:35.600 --> 08:37.556
Right, I'm going to ring him and tell him.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.876
That would be very supportive, Adam.
- Yeah.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.916
That wouldn't be supportive.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.110
God, Pete!

08:52.080 --> 08:53.718
Yeah. Adam, yeah.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.153
Pete, hi.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.276
Jenny's here. She told me about last night.

08:57.360 --> 08:59.555
Things change, don't they? Yeah, hang on.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.916
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, mate.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.274
Are you all right?

09:05.360 --> 09:08.193
Er... I should probably go.
- No, no, no. Stay, stay, stay.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.714
Is she listening?
- Yeah.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.189
Listen, do me a favour, mate.
Are you on the cordless?

09:13.280 --> 09:14.679
Yep.

09:14.760 --> 09:19.038
Tell you what, stick it on the side, right,
and you find out from Jen what's going on.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.792
And I'll listen in, OK?

09:20.880 --> 09:22.518
Right.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.516
Bye.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.436
Um...

09:32.960 --> 09:34.916
So why are you off Pete?

09:36.120 --> 09:38.076
God...

09:39.160 --> 09:42.311
It's sort of worse than that, really.
- Pardon?

09:43.600 --> 09:46.478
I mean, let's not sod about here. It's...

09:47.840 --> 09:51.196
I just...I just don't see in him
what I used to.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.872
See in him what?

09:52.960 --> 09:54.916
God, it's the guilt, you know.

09:55.840 --> 09:59.276
Our child's, what, a year old,
and what am I thinking?

09:59.360 --> 10:04.673
It's just...you can't dictate -
and I don't even like saying it, but... -

10:04.760 --> 10:07.593
when you're going to fall out of love
with someone.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.510
There. Shit.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.156
You want coffee?
- Er, tea.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.476
Um...

10:21.560 --> 10:23.516
Is there a particular reason?

10:23.600 --> 10:25.556
How do you mean?

10:25.640 --> 10:27.596
Well, er...

10:28.960 --> 10:30.518
Um...

10:30.600 --> 10:32.556
Have you met someone else?

10:34.520 --> 10:36.476
What makes you say that?

10:36.560 --> 10:38.869
Oh, come on, Jen, look at yourself.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.554
Attractive, fit, big girl you are.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.074
I mean, any man in his right mind
is gonna want to...

10:44.160 --> 10:46.799
No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.917
Really?
- Yeah.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.308
As it happens, yeah...

10:56.880 --> 10:58.233
..there is someone.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.758
There's someone else?

11:05.640 --> 11:07.596
What's he like?

11:11.360 --> 11:13.316
He's seeing someone at the minute.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.314
But it's not serious. Er... Lives alone.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.793
Funny.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.359
He's really funny.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.829
Er... He's quite good-looking.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.434
Not as much as he thinks. But um...

11:28.800 --> 11:30.756
Not big on cleanliness.

11:33.680 --> 11:35.636
Have you got any clean mugs, Adam?

11:40.640 --> 11:42.198
Does Pete know him?

11:43.320 --> 11:45.276
Yeah.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.472
It's his best friend.

11:51.760 --> 11:53.079
His best friend?

11:54.760 --> 11:56.512
But that's um...

11:57.680 --> 11:59.318
Adam.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.913
Of course it's...

12:18.320 --> 12:20.245
She's just about to tell you...

12:20.579 --> 12:22.836
and then there's static on the
line and the phone goes dead.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.992
God! Look at that!
''United striker linked with Inter''!

12:26.080 --> 12:27.832
Who is it, Adam?
- Ryan Giggs.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.115
Giggsy?
- Inter reckon he's worth 20 million pounds.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.553
No, Adam!

12:33.360 --> 12:34.713
I can't remember.

12:34.800 --> 12:36.995
What do you mean, you can't remember?

12:37.080 --> 12:39.833
I thought you were listening.
- I couldn't hear anything!

12:40.920 --> 12:43.480
God! There must be something. A first name!

12:43.560 --> 12:45.232
I'm sorry.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.470
Oh, God! Let's work with what we've got.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.869
It's um... Well, it's obviously
someone I know.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.349
Could be someone at work. Maybe a friend.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.351
Look, are you gonna bowl, or what? Come on.

13:00.560 --> 13:03.313
Ah! Jenny says he lives alone,
so he's obviously a sad git.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.356
Hey! I live alone!

13:05.440 --> 13:09.194
He says he's good-looking,
so he's obviously an arrogant bastard.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.759
Jen says he's funny.

13:13.840 --> 13:17.355
Yeah, but I'm funny! Aren't I?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.430
He's not big on cleanliness. I mean...

13:20.520 --> 13:23.592
Jenny doesn't know any students.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.352
God!

13:25.440 --> 13:27.874
Hang on. I know who it is.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.035
Who?

13:30.120 --> 13:33.112
It's Roger Braithwaite.
- Oh! He's gay!

13:33.200 --> 13:34.553
Oh, yeah.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.033
I'm going to ask her.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.995
Ah! Perfect timing.
- No, no, no, no!

13:42.080 --> 13:44.799
No, no, no. She'll think I told you.
I've got to go.

13:44.880 --> 13:48.316
What? You've got another frame to play.
- I need to see Rachel.

13:48.400 --> 13:50.038
Hiya.
- Jen. Hi.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.237
Listen, I've got to go.
- Great! I win. Woo-hoo!

13:53.320 --> 13:54.469
Bye. Have fun.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.755
I think it's brilliant you're spending
so much time with Josh, David.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.717
Yes. Yes.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.472
So do I.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.358
You won't let it interfere
with you finding a job, will you?

14:22.440 --> 14:23.634
No.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.312
Here, have another cup of tea.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.789
What if a head-hunter calls
and you're out with him?

14:27.880 --> 14:29.836
I've always got my mobile with me.

14:29.920 --> 14:33.356
Yeah, well... I can think of times
when that won't be practical.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.634
Like what?

14:37.520 --> 14:38.748
Hello?

14:40.000 --> 14:40.989
Hello?

14:41.080 --> 14:45.437
I don't think that's very likely, do you?
- Depends how often you go swimming.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.590
Or if you've called any head-hunters.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.356
Karen, you know the other evening,

14:52.440 --> 14:54.670
when I was collecting Josh from nursery?

14:57.600 --> 14:59.477
I nearly lost him, Karen.

14:59.560 --> 15:00.959
He never runs off very far.

15:01.040 --> 15:04.157
No... He was nearly hit by a car.

15:04.240 --> 15:07.516
What? - I didn't mention it
cos I didn't want to alarm you.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.478
David, you should...
- There I was, in my own little world.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.313
I took my eye off him
for a couple of seconds and...

15:14.960 --> 15:16.916
It was as close as that, Karen.

15:19.400 --> 15:23.279
And it made me think that now that I've got
this period of enforced leisure...

15:24.280 --> 15:27.397
..I'll use it so that I can
put my family first.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.675
It's nice and clean now.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.631
So what you're saying is,

15:35.720 --> 15:38.029
you haven't made any effort
to find another job.

15:38.120 --> 15:41.874
No, of course I have.
Anyway, we've got to be realistic, Karen.

15:41.960 --> 15:45.236
In this climate, I may not be offered
anything. Which is OK. It's fine.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.073
Which means I can spend more time with Josh.

15:50.560 --> 15:52.198
And you.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.748
We can't afford our lifestyle
on just my salary.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.796
Yeah, but if you get a promotion...

15:57.800 --> 15:59.756
OK, OK, we'll make some cutbacks.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.996
There's your riding lessons.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.996
Futile business anyway.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.712
And that health club you never go to.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.633
And, um, what sacrifices
are you prepared to make?

16:13.920 --> 16:15.672
Ramona.
- What?

16:17.360 --> 16:20.477
Well, she doesn't do anything
now that I'm looking after Josh.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.391
It's only a nanny without a child...

16:22.480 --> 16:24.436
..is like a fish without a bicycle.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.476
Precisely.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.637
Anyway, so that's my contribution
to cutting costs. Her wages.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.715
I don't know, David.
I'll have to think about it.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.313
Oh! In your eye.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.879
Oh, oh, oh.
- Oh, oh, oh.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.791
- That's it.
- There we are.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.713
Hey, what did Natalie want the other day
when she rang?

16:46.800 --> 16:51.396
I'll get a towel. Oh, there was just um...
some project I'd been working on.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.835
She wanted some free advice.
Here, in your eye.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.876
God, she's got a nerve, that woman.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.916
I hope you told her where to get off.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.070
It doesn't pay to offend these people.

17:01.200 --> 17:03.270
Come on, out you get.

17:10.599 --> 17:12.556
You're doing it again.

17:12.640 --> 17:14.358
What?
- Smiling.

17:14.440 --> 17:17.113
You always do that after sex.
What are you thinking about?

17:18.160 --> 17:20.116
Nothing.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.032
Come on!
- Nothing.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.474
Was it me?
- No, Amy, it wasn't you.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.318
If you must know,
I was thinking about my ex, Rachel.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.516
With the emphasis on ex?

17:37.720 --> 17:39.392
Yeah.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.391
I saw her tonight.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.277
For the last time.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.794
<i>She was baby-sitting
round at Pete and Jen's. '</i>

17:45.880 --> 17:50.237
I haven't managed to get him down yet.
I don't think I'm really cut out for this.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.073
Anyway, um... Rachel, I...

17:53.160 --> 17:55.833
I really wanted to apologise
for the other night.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.916
What I said was unforgivable.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.430
No, it was definitely forgivable.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.636
Here, here. I'll take him.
- Thanks.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.159
Oh, yah-yah-yah-yah-yah.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.913
Do you want a drink?

18:12.000 --> 18:14.560
Well, I shouldn't really stay.
Oh, go on, then.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.875
Time for you to go to bed, boy.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.916
It was OK.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.636
Closure?

18:26.720 --> 18:29.314
Well, I'd never say that but...

18:39.360 --> 18:41.316
Adam, I am sorry.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.552
God, my life.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.592
Anyway, one thing's for sure,
I'm going to have to get a lodger.

18:52.680 --> 18:56.355
I've been putting it off in case things
changed, but...since they haven't...

18:57.400 --> 18:59.356
Oh, do you have to?

18:59.440 --> 19:02.477
I mean, I'll have to start wearing clothes.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.516
Can't afford this place on my own.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.558
You'll get a foul-smelling bloke
who'll pee on the toilet seat

19:07.640 --> 19:09.756
and lech at me when he thinks
I'm not looking.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.718
Oh, Adam, if you get a lodger
it won't feel like home.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.792
Um... It's not your home.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.270
I know the perfect person.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.828
And she'd jump at the chance
of moving in with you.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.831
Oh, yeah?

19:24.920 --> 19:28.310
Ooh, um... Er... No, Amy, no.
I don't think so.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.393
I mean, we hardly know each other.
Well, obviously we know each other, but...

19:32.480 --> 19:33.993
Not me.
- ...you know.Oh.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.800
I get to stay here, anyway.
Why would I want to pay rent?

19:37.880 --> 19:41.793
No, it's a girl from work. She lives
with her boyfriend but he's a shit.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.713
She can't move out
till she's got somewhere else.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.756
Right, well, yeah, send her round.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.353
She's great fun.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.635
Her name's Rachel.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.439
What's the matter?

20:03.920 --> 20:05.876
What time is it, Pete?

20:22.920 --> 20:24.876
Morning.

20:55.320 --> 20:58.596
<i>As it happens, yeah,
there is someone.</i>

21:16.480 --> 21:17.959
<i>Thursday morning.</i>

21:18.040 --> 21:19.996
<i>Started again, right on cue.</i>

21:20.080 --> 21:22.799
<i>Why do I always look llke shit
when my period starts?</i>

21:29.040 --> 21:30.598
<i>There is a God.</i>

21:30.680 --> 21:33.717
<i>Today, I saw this dress. 80 quid!
But then...</i>

21:33.800 --> 21:35.313
<i>That's 8 pounds, please.</i>

21:36.400 --> 21:38.516
<i>So, what to do?</i>

21:51.120 --> 21:52.633
I'm the king of the castle!

21:56.800 --> 21:59.314
<i>Honestly, what do you think?</i>

22:01.200 --> 22:03.031
I think I don't love you any more.

22:04.920 --> 22:06.831
I think I don't love you any more.

22:11.520 --> 22:14.637
I just don't see in him what I used to.
- See in him, what?

22:14.720 --> 22:16.517
God, it's the guilt, you know.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.595
<i>My child's, what, a year old,
and what am I thinking?</i>

22:27.200 --> 22:28.997
It's his best friend.

22:29.080 --> 22:30.752
But that's um...

22:32.280 --> 22:36.478
<i>Adam... Of course it's you.</i>

23:09.520 --> 23:10.714
Hello, Daddy!

23:12.360 --> 23:14.920
Hello? What?

23:18.880 --> 23:21.917
What? He's so grumpy. Come on!

23:41.480 --> 23:43.232
Karen! Hi!

23:44.280 --> 23:46.669
Natalie Lawrence. David's ex-boss.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.320
Yeah, I know who you are.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.038
I didn't know you were a member here.

23:51.120 --> 23:54.669
Yeah, well, thanks to you,
I might not be for much longer.

24:04.960 --> 24:08.589
Karen, correct me if I'm wrong,
but do I detect a little hostility here?

24:08.680 --> 24:10.955
Are you surprised?
- Quite frankly, yes.

24:11.040 --> 24:14.669
Do you want gratitude? - I'm not
particularly looking for thanks, but...

24:14.760 --> 24:16.990
Is that how it works where you come from,
Natalie?

24:17.080 --> 24:19.878
You stab someone in the back
and expect them to suck up to you?

24:19.960 --> 24:22.428
What are you talking about?
Who did I stab in the back?

24:22.520 --> 24:25.398
David's too public school
to tell you what he thinks.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.950
But I have no such qualms.
- What are you talking about?

24:29.040 --> 24:30.996
The British educational system?

24:31.080 --> 24:35.437
First of all, you sack my husband,
then you want free advice?

24:35.520 --> 24:39.877
No. First of all, I sack your husband,
then I offer him another job.

24:39.960 --> 24:42.155
A better one, in fact.
- What?

24:42.240 --> 24:44.708
I joined DZQ.
I asked David to be my second.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.475
But ever since your son nearly had
that accident, he turned me down flat.

24:48.560 --> 24:50.312
He says he's done with working.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.398
Did he?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.193
Adam Williams.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.635
This is Receptlon. Pete Gifford to see you.

24:58.720 --> 25:02.349
Pete? Er... Yeah, OK.

25:02.440 --> 25:03.953
Yeah. Send him up.

25:08.600 --> 25:11.319
Adam Williams? Anyone? Adam Williams?

25:11.400 --> 25:12.992
Adam Williams?

25:13.080 --> 25:14.911
Anybody? Adam Williams?

25:15.000 --> 25:15.989
Adam Williams? No?

25:17.240 --> 25:18.468
Adam Williams?

25:19.600 --> 25:22.114
Ah, Adam.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.394
You bastard!

25:28.240 --> 25:30.674
To think I trusted you! God!

25:32.160 --> 25:34.549
I should have guessed from her description.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.392
The arrogant git bit.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.315
And then what do you do?
- What are you doing?

25:40.400 --> 25:43.039
Shut up! You take advantage,

25:43.120 --> 25:46.237
While I'm listening on the phone!
- Pete, Pete.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.355
Pete, Pete!

25:47.440 --> 25:49.192
You bastard!
- Pete!

25:51.760 --> 25:55.150
You don't see her! You don't talk to her!

25:55.240 --> 25:57.310
You stay away!

26:10.760 --> 26:12.876
It's...it's OK.

26:14.960 --> 26:17.269
Yeah, he's a friend of mine. It's OK.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.829
Oh, no, no, no. That's my room. Although...

26:27.920 --> 26:30.275
Um... And this would be yours.

26:30.360 --> 26:32.476
It's a bit young for me, isn't it?

26:32.560 --> 26:36.269
Yeah. Um... Yeah, I mean,
I'll clear all this stuff out.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.158
And obviously, I'll put in a chest
of drawers,

26:39.240 --> 26:40.958
a bidet,

26:41.040 --> 26:42.996
bed.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.116
I take it you'd prefer a double.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.316
Yeah. Um...

26:47.400 --> 26:49.914
As you can see, it's
recently been decorated.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.479
What, in two shades of yellow?

26:51.560 --> 26:54.996
I ran out halfway through.
Couldn't find the same colour.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.036
So how much are you asking?

26:58.360 --> 27:00.874
Um... Going rate, I suppose.

27:00.960 --> 27:04.919
I saw one yesterday that was 65 quid a week,
including bills.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.911
Sounds reasonable.
- No, it wasn't.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.831
So how about 50 pounds?
- 60 pounds.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.036
55 pounds?
- Done.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.872
So, are you going to take it?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.075
It's already taken.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.275
Oh! Who by?

27:16.320 --> 27:20.108
Excellent! My favourite man
living with my favourite girl!

27:23.280 --> 27:24.679
Let's go and celebrate.

27:24.760 --> 27:27.228
Er... Oh, God, I can't.
Sorry, I've got to go.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.834
Um... Nice to meet you.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.876
Yeah, and you.
- Bye.

27:33.600 --> 27:35.556
Cheers, anyway.
- Cheers.

28:22.680 --> 28:24.398
What?
- What?

28:35.560 --> 28:37.278
What do you want?
- To talk.

28:37.360 --> 28:40.591
Who to?
- You. And Jen.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.676
I'll give you this.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.716
You've got balls.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.152
Hiya. God, what happened to you?

28:52.240 --> 28:53.912
Pete.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.114
What have you said?
- That you and Jenny are in love.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.350
No, we're not.
- I read it in her diary!

29:00.440 --> 29:03.512
For Christ's sakes!
How long has this been going on?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.079
Nothing's going on.

29:05.160 --> 29:06.798
You read my diary. Right.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.438
So I'm the one at fault now, am I?

29:08.520 --> 29:10.511
You are if you think we're in love.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.192
You kissed her.
- It wasn't a kiss.

29:12.280 --> 29:16.592
I was trying to shut her up so you
wouldn't hear who she's got a crush on.

29:17.880 --> 29:20.189
How would Pete hear?

29:20.960 --> 29:22.188
The phone.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.518
Pete was on the other end.

29:29.240 --> 29:31.196
Look, Jen. I like you.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.635
I love you like a sister, but...

29:38.240 --> 29:40.595
Jen, for Christ's sake!
You're my best mate's wife!

29:51.200 --> 29:53.236
She's not in love.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.675
Nor am I.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.516
Do you think I wanted this to happen?

29:59.600 --> 30:02.273
I mean, do you believe this?

30:03.360 --> 30:05.237
You're my best friend.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.276
I've lost Rachel.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.874
I've lost her. And Jenny...

30:10.720 --> 30:13.917
You and her are my best mates
so come for a drink.

30:16.080 --> 30:19.152
Peter, it's shite if I walk away from here
and that's it.

30:19.240 --> 30:21.993
You're my best friend.
Come for a drink, will you?

30:23.440 --> 30:28.434
Oil drill housing - blank, blank, R,
blank, I, blank, blank.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.876
Derrick.

30:35.080 --> 30:38.117
Ramona, I left some of Josh's clothes
in the bathroom.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.190
He think they gonna walk by themselves?

30:49.640 --> 30:51.870
You know, her attitude's getting worse.

30:51.960 --> 30:53.916
I think we should give her notice.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.950
David, can you do the meal tomorrow, please?

31:04.040 --> 31:07.635
Sure. I'll pop down to M and S.
Josh can help me choose.

31:07.720 --> 31:10.792
No. I want to you to cook.
I've got people coming for dinner.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.677
Who?
- Just some friends from work.

31:12.760 --> 31:15.479
But I want to impress them,
so no ready meals.

31:15.560 --> 31:17.994
If you want to impress them, you do it.
I can't cook.

31:18.080 --> 31:23.029
David, I'm at work all day. I would very
much like to spend some time with my son.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.874
You have all day to prepare a meal.
Even you should be able to do that!

31:30.360 --> 31:33.750
With offbeat rhythm, 10 letters.

31:33.840 --> 31:35.796
Syncopated.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.956
Can I ask your advice?

31:46.040 --> 31:48.508
What about?

31:48.600 --> 31:50.556
You're going to love this.

31:51.320 --> 31:53.276
Women.

31:54.440 --> 31:56.795
Are you taking the piss?
- No! No.

31:58.320 --> 32:00.675
It's about my new lodger.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.079
Rachel.

32:03.360 --> 32:05.351
Rachel Two.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.076
I really fancy her.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.076
I want to ask her out.

32:15.160 --> 32:16.593
What do you want my advice for?

32:16.680 --> 32:18.636
Well, you know...

32:19.680 --> 32:23.559
..do you think it's ethical,
me being her landlord?

32:27.880 --> 32:31.509
Tell you what, mate. I don't think your
girlfriend will be that well pleased.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.511
Amy?

32:33.600 --> 32:34.828
Oh.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.150
She's not really my girlfriend.

32:37.240 --> 32:38.719
Well, she thinks she is.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.268
She's even got your photo
on her desk at work.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.318
Where did she get that?
- She pestered me for ages.

32:44.400 --> 32:48.552
I found one of you and me at Blackpool,
on the Big Dipper.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.039
She cut me off.

32:50.120 --> 32:52.076
I remember that.

32:52.160 --> 32:54.116
It's not very flattering.

32:54.200 --> 32:56.714
How do you think I feel?

32:58.600 --> 33:00.556
Look...

33:01.760 --> 33:05.639
If you want to ask her out, ask her out.
But you've got to get shot of Amy.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.238
Right?

33:11.080 --> 33:13.275
Thank you.

33:16.880 --> 33:19.440
I've been thinking...
- You ought to give me a...

33:20.600 --> 33:23.353
You first.
- You ought to give me a key to your house.

33:23.440 --> 33:26.193
Why?
- For Rachel. You didn't give her one.

33:26.280 --> 33:28.669
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.711
Take these. I've got a spare set at work.

33:31.800 --> 33:35.110
What were you going to say?
You look serious.

33:35.200 --> 33:36.997
What are you doing?
- Getting frisky.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.559
Amy, we're on a tram!

33:38.640 --> 33:41.154
It's not that crowded.
Have you ever done it on a tram?

33:41.240 --> 33:43.151
No. Have you?

33:44.600 --> 33:46.795
Look, Amy, there's something
I've got to say.

33:46.880 --> 33:49.440
I meant to say it last night, but...
- Something came up.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.557
I don't think we should see each other!
- Why?

33:52.640 --> 33:55.757
Because... I don't think we're compatible.

33:55.840 --> 33:58.718
Compatible?
All that sex and we're not compatible?

33:58.800 --> 34:03.112
No! I mean, I like the sex as much
as the next man. Probably more.

34:03.200 --> 34:08.478
You're great at it. It must be the practice.
But I want more from a relationship.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.071
We have more. Much more.

34:12.159 --> 34:13.592
We have nothing!

34:13.679 --> 34:16.989
Look, I'm sorry, Amy.
We're just not meant to be.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.956
You don't mean this. You're just tired.

34:19.040 --> 34:20.553
I'm exhausted!

34:20.639 --> 34:23.552
Please, take care. I'm sorry.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.949
And one bag of plain flour.

34:36.320 --> 34:37.992
Two red peppers.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.757
And some fresh basil.

34:41.880 --> 34:45.156
That's all the ingredients you need
to make Parmesan Chicken Bake.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.835
Except the chicken.

34:51.360 --> 34:53.510
Oh, no! I'll get your coat.

34:56.600 --> 35:01.196
I've got some people coming for
dinner tonight. Join us if you want to.

35:01.280 --> 35:03.748
Thanks, but...
- David's cooking.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.910
Really? My God.

35:07.200 --> 35:09.873
No. I'm going to pop round and see Adam.

35:11.560 --> 35:15.269
I've been thinking. We got on really well
when he came round to Pete and Jenny's.

35:23.240 --> 35:25.595
We had some good times together, didn't we?

35:27.000 --> 35:28.956
Yeah.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.996
And some great times.

35:32.160 --> 35:33.479
Yeah. You mentioned.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.074
No, Karen. I mean really, really well.

35:37.480 --> 35:38.879
Some of the things he said...

35:38.960 --> 35:41.520
I suppose...

35:41.600 --> 35:43.556
one of the reasons I was so upset...

35:45.160 --> 35:47.116
..was that um...

35:48.360 --> 35:51.750
..well, until I met you,
I'd never really wanted children.

35:51.840 --> 35:54.638
He could have been sending me a message.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.676
Do you want to go to bed?

35:57.720 --> 36:00.029
I mean, if I'm keeping you up...

36:00.120 --> 36:03.078
Yeah, that he still wants to sleep with you.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.594
No. I think we could get
back together again.

36:05.680 --> 36:09.468
I think he's willing to put the past
behind us and to start again.

36:09.560 --> 36:12.518
He didn't say so
because he wasn't sure how I'd react.

36:12.600 --> 36:15.353
Yeah, well, experience will have
taught him that.

36:15.440 --> 36:19.069
I know. It's my turn to make the first move.
And I'm willing to.

36:20.400 --> 36:22.231
What's all that?
- Oh, nothing.

36:22.320 --> 36:24.311
Rachel, come on. What is it?

36:27.160 --> 36:29.116
I'm writing a speech.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.350
What for?
- For Adam.

36:32.640 --> 36:33.755
Why?

36:33.840 --> 36:36.070
Well, I don't want to say the wrong thing.

36:37.680 --> 36:41.070
It's a bit long, isn't it?
- No! Those are all the drafts.

36:41.160 --> 36:43.594
But I'm really getting there!

36:43.680 --> 36:46.911
Er... Place chicken breasts
between sheets of clear film,

36:47.000 --> 36:51.073
and flatten with a rolling pin
to a depth of five millimetres.

36:51.160 --> 36:53.276
OK, here we go. Do you want to try this?

36:54.640 --> 36:56.596
Flatten it. Go on, bash it.

36:58.080 --> 37:02.073
Five millimetres. Where's your drawing kit?
Keep bashing. Keep bashing.

37:02.160 --> 37:06.392
That's it. Er... Five millimetres.
Yeah. Right. Piece of cake this, Josh!

37:07.480 --> 37:08.595
What's next?

37:08.680 --> 37:10.989
E... Take the tomato sauce
prepared earlier...

37:14.000 --> 37:15.956
They can't bring that up just now!

37:16.880 --> 37:18.393
Oh, no.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.395
Oh, no!

37:48.480 --> 37:50.630
<i>David, can you get that, please?</i>

37:53.880 --> 37:55.199
<i>David!</i>

37:55.280 --> 37:57.874
Yes, madam. Yes, madam.
Three bags full, madam.

38:01.240 --> 38:04.471
Natalie! What are you doing here?
- I thought I was invited to dinner.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.597
Oh, I don't think you've met my new husband.
George, this is David.

38:07.680 --> 38:10.240
Natalie! I'm really glad you could make it.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.596
Natalie's a member of that health club
I never go to, darling.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.113
Really?

38:16.080 --> 38:18.275
Excuse me, please, I've just got to um...

38:18.360 --> 38:20.316
Kitchen.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.276
What do you think?

38:32.360 --> 38:35.432
Oh, David...I don't know.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.676
All right, I'll make it 30 quid.

38:41.240 --> 38:43.629
OK. But you, out!

38:45.200 --> 38:47.156
OK.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.796
Two glasses, sir.
- You're so kind.

38:59.520 --> 39:02.239
Champagne! That's my kind of man.

39:07.920 --> 39:10.753
Well, you know, I just wanted to...

39:11.800 --> 39:14.394
..welcome you to your new home.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.198
Well, that's great.

39:16.280 --> 39:18.157
I could get used to this.

39:19.240 --> 39:21.196
Cheers.
- Cheers, my dear.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.436
So, um...

39:35.520 --> 39:37.078
How was Amy today?

39:37.160 --> 39:38.912
What, you missing her, are you?

39:39.960 --> 39:40.995
No.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.834
I just...thought she might be a bit upset.

39:44.920 --> 39:46.194
Why?

39:46.280 --> 39:48.236
Thanks very much.

39:50.120 --> 39:51.599
Because we've split up.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.433
Well, she didn't mention it.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.552
She didn't mention it?

40:00.400 --> 40:02.197
Oh.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.320
So, you're young, free and single, then?

40:06.400 --> 40:07.594
Well...

40:09.440 --> 40:11.556
Free and single.

40:32.760 --> 40:36.275
So, Natalie,
how's the firm managing without David?

40:37.520 --> 40:40.318
Oh, I wouldn't know. I've moved on as well.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.516
Didn't David tell you?

40:44.120 --> 40:45.189
No.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.714
More, anyone? George, you'll have some?
- No.

40:47.800 --> 40:50.553
I joined DZQ.
The new international division.

40:50.640 --> 40:53.200
George, what is it you do?
Commodities, is it?

40:53.280 --> 40:55.589
A new division? So you're taking people on?

40:55.680 --> 40:57.636
Dessert! Right, um...

40:58.560 --> 41:00.039
Karen, would you give me a hand?

41:05.600 --> 41:08.592
What are you doing?
- I'm trying to find you a job.

41:08.680 --> 41:11.831
I don't want...
I don't think it's appropriate.

41:11.920 --> 41:14.673
This is a dinner party.
Natalie does not want to talk shop.

41:14.760 --> 41:17.399
She doesn't seem to mind.
- But I do.

41:22.680 --> 41:26.593
I'm quite capable of finding myself a job.
- You haven't had much luck so far.

41:26.680 --> 41:28.910
Besides, Natalie may only have
junior positions.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.468
I wouldn't call being her number two junior.

41:32.720 --> 41:34.073
How do you know about that?

41:34.160 --> 41:35.991
You lied to me, David!

41:37.360 --> 41:39.749
Natalie offered you a job
and you turned it down.

41:39.840 --> 41:43.515
Yes, because I want to spend more time
with my son. What's wrong with that?

41:44.600 --> 41:47.034
Besides, I'm quite happy to do housework.

41:47.120 --> 41:49.475
You? Housework?

41:49.560 --> 41:51.869
Where do we keep the ironing board?

41:51.960 --> 41:53.359
What?

41:53.440 --> 41:56.034
The ironing board. Where do we keep it?

41:57.640 --> 41:59.198
In the bathroom?

42:00.760 --> 42:04.275
David, you don't iron,
you don't clean, you don't cook.

42:04.360 --> 42:06.715
How much are you giving Ramona
for the meal tonight?

42:06.800 --> 42:08.153
30 quid.

42:08.240 --> 42:10.549
40 with the washing-up?
- Probably.

42:12.880 --> 42:16.714
David, you can work and be a good parent.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.155
It's just a question of striking a balance.

42:19.240 --> 42:24.189
Darling, if you really don't want to go back
to work, that's fine. I'll support you.

42:24.280 --> 42:25.838
Financially.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.831
And that is all.

42:31.800 --> 42:33.756
Sorry about that.
- No problem.

42:44.320 --> 42:46.276
So, David...

42:48.400 --> 42:50.356
..when can you start?

42:54.720 --> 42:56.676
Monday.

42:56.760 --> 42:58.432
Perfect.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.798
Ooh! This looks good.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.796
Yes, it's Spanish.

43:09.360 --> 43:11.999
All right, love. Did you want
to watch anything?

43:13.480 --> 43:15.436
Er... No.

43:15.520 --> 43:17.556
I'll be popping up myself in a minute.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.436
You're all right. Take your time.

43:22.160 --> 43:24.037
I've made the spare bed up.

43:25.840 --> 43:28.434
I'm sorry, Pete.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.872
Good night.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.878
Daddy's not going to be around
as much as he has been.

43:39.200 --> 43:41.430
Though more than I was before. I promise.

44:40.880 --> 44:41.915
Rachel!

44:43.040 --> 44:45.190
Don't say a word. Just listen.

44:47.160 --> 44:51.597
We love each other, Adam.
We always have done. And we always will.

44:51.680 --> 44:54.035
Regardless of what we do to each other.

44:54.120 --> 44:56.076
And God knows...

44:59.800 --> 45:01.756
Um...

45:02.920 --> 45:04.751
I've done some terrible...

45:04.840 --> 45:07.149
God knows,
I've done some terrible things to you.

45:09.440 --> 45:11.078
I wish that baby...

45:18.800 --> 45:21.473
I wish I could have been sure
that baby was yours.

45:21.560 --> 45:24.199
Because we'd make a great family.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.113
And we still can.

45:28.440 --> 45:30.396
Adam, let's get back together.

45:31.720 --> 45:35.156
And when you're ready, let's have that baby.

45:43.040 --> 45:44.393
I love you, Rachel.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.476
Your place or mine?
- Mine.

46:09.920 --> 46:12.070
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

46:34.040 --> 46:35.029
Loo.

46:41.280 --> 46:42.872
Oh, God!

46:42.960 --> 46:44.279
Well, don't go.

46:44.360 --> 46:46.954
I'm sorry, I've got to go.
I'm the same with the phone.

46:47.040 --> 46:51.352
Oh, Adam, please. - No, honestly,
listen, I'll be back, I'll be back.

46:55.480 --> 46:58.790
Get down. Get down.
You can't have your bone yet.

46:58.880 --> 47:00.836
Come on, big fella. Good lad.

47:03.200 --> 47:05.156
Don't say a word. Just listen.

47:07.200 --> 47:09.156
<i>Adam?</i>

47:10.200 --> 47:12.156
Adam?

47:16.080 --> 47:17.195
Shit.
