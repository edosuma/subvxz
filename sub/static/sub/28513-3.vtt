00:16.267 --> 00:17.975
Thinkin' we move
the rest of the herd

00:18.019 --> 00:19.518
down to the south end.
Yep.

00:19.562 --> 00:21.228
I guess we burn
all the dead ones, huh?

00:21.272 --> 00:22.938
Not much choice...
Flies have got to 'em.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.399
Yeah. Make sure you're
downwind of the house.

00:25.443 --> 00:27.192
You got it, boss.
Thanks, Gus. 'Preciate it.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.780
Hey, never seen
anything like this.

00:31.824 --> 00:33.782
Any idea who hit us?

00:33.826 --> 00:36.118
The Colonel's workin'
on it now.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.872
It's been two hours.
What'd you find out?

00:39.915 --> 00:41.707
South Texas
Improvement Company...

00:41.751 --> 00:43.375
It was formed less
than a week ago.

00:43.419 --> 00:45.711
No employees listed,
just domiciled in Pennsylvania,

00:45.755 --> 00:48.130
as a matter of fact.

00:48.174 --> 00:51.216
It's a blind tiger
for a Mr. Roy Endicott.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.052
Rockefeller's boy.

00:53.095 --> 00:55.679
Thank you.
<i>Are you sure?</i>

00:55.723 --> 00:57.556
Are you absolutely sure?

00:57.600 --> 00:59.475
It's me, Daddy.
Is there anything else?

00:59.518 --> 01:02.686
I'll call if I need you.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.981
How is the first son of Texas
this morning?

01:06.025 --> 01:09.109
He's an asshole.

01:09.153 --> 01:13.280
It's a comfort to know
some things never change.

01:13.324 --> 01:15.824
Eat something.
Not in the mood.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.578
Okay.

01:18.621 --> 01:21.246
So, what's going on?

01:21.290 --> 01:24.541
You summon me to your house
in the middle of the night,

01:24.585 --> 01:26.043
which is pretty reckless.

01:26.087 --> 01:27.544
You didn't have to come.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.506
Actually,
I find it attractive.

01:30.549 --> 01:33.342
But it's not at all
like you.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.803
So, what did he do?

01:35.846 --> 01:37.638
Nothing, just...

01:37.681 --> 01:41.266
no matter what problem I solve,
miracle I perform...

01:41.310 --> 01:44.895
enemy I vanquish...

01:44.939 --> 01:47.397
it will never, ever be enough
for that old bastard.

01:47.441 --> 01:52.027
It's easy to overlook someone
who does everything right

01:52.071 --> 01:53.862
and does it well.

01:53.906 --> 01:56.198
Yeah, you don't know
the half of it.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.660
Company's going to Pete.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.954
Aw, Finn, I'm sorry.

02:01.997 --> 02:05.415
He is grooming Pete
to run things...

02:05.459 --> 02:09.294
Things I already know how to do,
mind you.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.297
I'll be stuck here, in Austin,
greasing the wheels,

02:12.341 --> 02:14.675
living in God damn exile.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.844
I'll try not to be
offended by that.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.349
Sorry.

02:22.393 --> 02:24.518
You don't need
to hear this.

02:26.814 --> 02:31.108
Just that Pete doesn't give
a damn about the business.

02:31.152 --> 02:35.320
He sabotages our interests.
He aids our enemies.

02:35.364 --> 02:38.157
Colonel rewards him anyway,
over me.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.577
I wonder why.

02:45.708 --> 02:49.459
Daddy will never
admit to that.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.378
Oh, no, no.

02:51.422 --> 02:54.631
He will not do me that
one dignity.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.593
Instead he says
that I am weak...

02:57.636 --> 03:01.388
and incapable of securing
his precious legacy.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.311
My daddy doesn't
speak to me.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.105
Hasn't since he kicked me
out of the house 17 years ago.

03:10.149 --> 03:13.066
No matter how much
success I find,

03:13.110 --> 03:15.903
I will always be that boy
he walked in on

03:15.946 --> 03:18.071
bent over
in the preacher's shed.

03:21.243 --> 03:24.953
You never told me
about that.

03:24.997 --> 03:26.538
Been saving up.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.668
So, now you have
a choice...

03:31.712 --> 03:36.048
You can follow orders
or you can walk away.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.550
You have the connections
and the means

03:38.594 --> 03:39.927
to be your own man.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.598
It ain't that simple.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.725
Yes, it is.

03:50.147 --> 03:54.775
Thanks.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.033
It's awful.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.326
How can the do this?

04:46.370 --> 04:48.412
It's disgusting.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.458
Who did this?
Was it the sediciosos?

04:53.502 --> 04:54.876
Bandits steal cows.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.231
They don't ride
all the way up here

04:56.255 --> 04:58.338
just to cut them
into little pieces.

04:58.382 --> 05:01.883
I'm gonna find out who did this.
I promise.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.427
You kids don't need
to worry.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.470
W-What if next time,
they come for us?

05:05.514 --> 05:07.347
The men who did this
are cowards in the night,

05:07.391 --> 05:08.515
scared to show their faces.

05:08.559 --> 05:10.434
We're gonna find them.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.145
We're gonna make 'em real sorry
they ever set foot on our land.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.105
You got that?
Yes, sir.

05:15.149 --> 05:17.524
Jeannie?

05:19.278 --> 05:20.902
Yes, sir.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.904
Good.

05:22.948 --> 05:26.491
Daddy?

05:26.535 --> 05:29.286
I think that little one
lost her mamma.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.290
I think
you're right.

05:33.334 --> 05:34.541
I tell you what, Bug,

05:34.585 --> 05:36.960
You tend to that dogie,
she's yours.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.880
You can even pocket the money
when we take her to market.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.718
Okay.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.012
Yeah.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.148
You look angry.
Yeah, I'm angry.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.586
It's like the Old Testament
out there.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.485
It's a God damn massacre.

06:01.528 --> 06:04.988
35 head, splayed out
in a thousand bits and pieces.

06:05.032 --> 06:06.406
It's got Jonas scared.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.761
Jeannie, she's putting
on a brave face,

06:07.785 --> 06:09.159
but I know when
she's upset.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.535
Well, she's strong.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.412
She shouldn't have to be!
She's a child.

06:12.456 --> 06:14.289
You're right!

06:14.333 --> 06:17.292
You should be angry.
You should be mad as hell.

06:17.336 --> 06:20.379
Those were your top-end cattle
out there.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.381
Where you going?

06:22.424 --> 06:27.594
To see our good friend...
Eugene "Buddy" Monahan.

06:27.638 --> 06:30.347
This has his fingerprints
all over it.

06:30.391 --> 06:32.516
Turns out, he's in bed
with Standard.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.309
Which one?

06:34.353 --> 06:36.728
Pennsylvania.

06:36.772 --> 06:38.397
These guys will try
to come in here,

06:38.440 --> 06:40.816
take what's ours, and give us
pennies on the dollar.

06:45.406 --> 06:48.824
I'm going with you.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.909
Suit yourself.

07:06.385 --> 07:08.051
How are the kids?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.262
They'll be okay.
We're gonna fix this.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.472
You and the Colonel...

07:12.516 --> 07:14.224
together?

07:14.268 --> 07:15.809
I'm trying, Sally.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.477
I really am.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.027
Morning, gentlemen.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.446
I want a word
with you outside.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.406
You're Pete, right?
Now!

07:31.577 --> 07:33.452
Boy's got some kick in 'im.

07:33.495 --> 07:37.539
Mr. Monahan.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.541
You told me
you were from Lubbock.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.209
That I did.

07:41.253 --> 07:42.919
Hard to imagine
a real Texan

07:42.963 --> 07:45.505
coming onto another man's land
in the dead of night

07:45.549 --> 07:47.716
and mutilating his cattle.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.885
I'd expect that kind
of turpitude

07:49.928 --> 07:51.386
from a foreigner,

07:51.430 --> 07:54.055
like that Roy Endicott
over at Standard Oil.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.850
I heard about your stock.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.603
That's generations of breeding
all gone to waste,

07:59.646 --> 08:01.438
and it's a damn shame.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.814
But I can assure you,

08:02.858 --> 08:05.192
I had nothing to do
with the incident.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.110
Hell, 'round here,

08:07.154 --> 08:09.029
that sort of thing'll
get you hanged.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.198
Why, just last week...

08:11.241 --> 08:14.034
somebody poured cement
down five drill holes

08:14.077 --> 08:15.160
belonging to your neighbor,

08:15.204 --> 08:16.870
ran him straight
out of business.

08:16.914 --> 08:19.539
Poor old Percy Midkiff.

08:19.583 --> 08:23.335
Had to sell
his mineral rights.

08:23.378 --> 08:26.379
Sold 'em to you,
I believe.

08:26.423 --> 08:29.132
You got 13 leases...

08:29.176 --> 08:32.219
over 300 square-miles.

08:32.261 --> 08:34.554
Now, that's a lot
to look after.

08:34.597 --> 08:38.433
A producing well can get
vandalized at any time.

08:38.477 --> 08:41.520
Fires are right common
on the oil patch,

08:41.563 --> 08:45.315
Or any number of tribulations
could befall you and yours.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.569
On your own, seems to me,

08:49.613 --> 08:52.447
you're vulnerable.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.949
Threats don't
work on us.

08:53.992 --> 08:55.283
My friend...

08:55.327 --> 08:58.703
my employers
have resources

08:58.747 --> 09:00.830
to beggar the imagination.

09:00.874 --> 09:04.251
And you...
You can no more stave them off

09:04.294 --> 09:07.254
than the Comanche could stop
the settling of the West.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.840
I want you
to leave town...

09:10.884 --> 09:13.718
now.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.554
If you do this,

09:15.597 --> 09:18.181
I will take no action
against you.

09:21.395 --> 09:23.979
So that's it, huh?

09:24.022 --> 09:25.605
No room to negotiate?

09:25.649 --> 09:28.900
Come on, Pete.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.777
Colonel...

09:34.449 --> 09:36.825
Will you let me
make you rich?

09:36.868 --> 09:39.619
That's what I want
more than anything.

09:42.583 --> 09:46.251
Do take care.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.673
Dad.
Yeah?

09:51.717 --> 09:53.592
We have to do
something.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.385
How do you want
to respond?

09:55.429 --> 09:59.014
You, more than anyone,
have been wronged by this man.

09:59.057 --> 10:02.434
Nothing brings a family together
like a declaration of war.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.978
Something like that.

11:09.378 --> 11:10.378
Eli!

12:15.235 --> 12:17.610
Take mine.

14:47.429 --> 14:50.346
Killing the horses,
it's...

14:57.397 --> 15:01.190
The Caddo...
They kill horses.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.569
We have more honor
than that.

15:04.613 --> 15:07.739
I want our daughter to know
our people are...

15:10.744 --> 15:13.536
How do you know
it's a girl?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.829
I know.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.083
What if this is
a warning?

15:21.922 --> 15:23.963
It's gonna be okay.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.507
We're gonna find
another band soon.

15:48.907 --> 15:50.490
You okay?

15:50.533 --> 15:52.533
We did what we had to.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.328
Now we keep going...

15:55.372 --> 15:57.455
towards the Mexico border.

16:00.877 --> 16:03.211
They left bent branches
as a sign.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.171
Are they close?

16:05.215 --> 16:06.464
It's hard to tell.

16:06.508 --> 16:08.758
The tracks are old.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.343
It's another band.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.762
It's good news.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.430
They have to take us in,
don't they?

16:16.643 --> 16:18.559
It is a custom.

16:18.603 --> 16:22.313
So, what's the problem?

16:22.357 --> 16:25.441
I know their chief.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.068
Is he an enemy?

16:31.116 --> 16:33.157
He's my son.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.664
No, that's it for me.
I told you.

16:39.708 --> 16:43.751
Night.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.231
You guys would stay
in there all night.

16:45.255 --> 16:46.879
I know you would.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.715
Excuse me.

16:48.758 --> 16:51.801
I'm lookin' for a fella
by the name of Buddy Monahan.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.849
Well, you found him.

16:57.892 --> 17:02.562
Good evening to you,
Sheriff.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.856
What can I help you with?

17:04.898 --> 17:07.150
I'm trying to get to the bottom
of what happened

17:07.193 --> 17:09.986
to Colonel McCullough's
35 head.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.238
Ah.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.534
It's all right, boys.
It's all right.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.789
It's all right.

17:21.833 --> 17:25.501
This here's
a man of the law.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.212
We're gonna show him
all due respect.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.933
Now, this here's my lawyer.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.519
If you give him a call,

17:43.563 --> 17:47.857
I'm sure we can clear
all this up lickety-split.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.777
A Philadelphia lawyer.

17:50.820 --> 17:55.114
And look at this paper,
real fancy.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.700
I've never seen paper
like this.

17:57.744 --> 18:01.496
Boys, check this out.

18:01.539 --> 18:03.289
But my budget is
tight, sir.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.584
I don't think I can afford
the long-distance charges.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.669
So let's take a ride
instead.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.380
Now, Sheriff,

18:11.424 --> 18:13.716
I'm sure there's an agreement
we can reach.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.177
I've got resources
at my disposal.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.178
All right.

18:17.222 --> 18:18.971
We'll see about that.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.853
I'll call the lawyer.

18:49.838 --> 18:52.547
Colonel, Pete,

18:52.590 --> 18:54.382
here's your boy.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.300
Well, much obliged.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.010
And you tell Sadie
I really enjoyed

18:58.054 --> 18:59.345
that pie
you brought over.

18:59.389 --> 19:00.763
Sure will.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.473
She'll be tickled
that you said so.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.809
Good man.

19:04.853 --> 19:07.687
Well, I'll leave
you boys to it.

19:07.730 --> 19:08.938
Good evening, now.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.940
Sheriff.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.568
Sheriff, this isn't right!

19:25.248 --> 19:27.081
My daddy told you
to get out of town.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.710
You should've listened.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.462
Well, I had little say
in the matter,

19:33.506 --> 19:35.381
'cause I work for a ruthless
son of a bitch

19:35.425 --> 19:37.884
that don't take "no"
for an answer!

19:42.932 --> 19:46.309
When the Comanche would
capture an enemy,

19:46.352 --> 19:50.021
they had a great many ways
of dealing with 'em.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.732
Sometimes, they would put
a captive in a hole

19:52.775 --> 19:55.610
about like the one
you're standing in right now...

19:59.115 --> 20:01.574
...pack in the dirt
around him...

20:05.788 --> 20:08.706
...and bury him up to his head.

20:08.750 --> 20:12.460
And then, they'd carefully
slice off his eyelids,

20:12.503 --> 20:15.463
leave 'em out there
to slowly go blind.

20:15.506 --> 20:19.217
It's not about
taking a man's life.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.344
It's about conquering
his spirit.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.058
You're just a messenger,

20:27.101 --> 20:30.811
but you can take this message
to your master.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.481
You may have all the resources
from here to kingdom come,

20:33.524 --> 20:37.526
but Standard Oil will never get
into south Texas for a reason.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.987
We fought off the Indians,
the Mexicans,

20:40.031 --> 20:42.281
the Apache,
and the Comanche.

20:42.325 --> 20:45.159
So if Roy Endicott
wants to do battle,

20:45.203 --> 20:47.411
he should know...

20:47.455 --> 20:50.498
the climate here
is inhospitable.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.774
You might want
to start walkin'.

21:16.818 --> 21:19.485
Buzzards'll catch wind of you
before long.

21:49.183 --> 21:51.851
Camp is close.

21:51.894 --> 21:53.853
These tracks
will lead us there.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.987
Get me a robe.

22:18.588 --> 22:20.046
Hello?

23:24.821 --> 23:28.280
It's a good name for you.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.319
What's wrong?

24:07.363 --> 24:08.696
He's hurt.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.369
Why didn't you say?

25:51.217 --> 25:56.011
Tiehteti is helping me
to talk like white men.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.680
Good, huh?

25:59.934 --> 26:04.436
Toshaway taught me.
He loves the whites.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.356
He was a translator
at the Council House fight.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.858
He translated the words
of Spirit Talker

26:09.902 --> 26:13.153
and got our people shot.

26:13.197 --> 26:16.282
I never heard
that story.

26:16.325 --> 26:18.534
It's my son's favorite.

26:22.290 --> 26:24.748
Why don't we smoke?

26:26.627 --> 26:28.669
Smoke for Tiehteti.

26:31.799 --> 26:36.385
If Pathetic White Boy
is such a great warrior,

26:36.429 --> 26:38.637
why doesn't he change his name?

26:38.681 --> 26:40.222
Can I do that?

26:40.266 --> 26:44.560
My son is proud of the name
his father gave him.

26:44.604 --> 26:50.399
Our people respect him
for his bravery and strength,

26:50.443 --> 26:52.526
not for what he calls himself.

27:13.883 --> 27:15.257
Ah.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.093
I like that they paint
pictures on skins.

27:20.139 --> 27:24.767
We should do that, too,
tell stories for our daughter.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.311
Some from the band where
I was born, some from here.

27:29.815 --> 27:32.316
Hey, what's wrong?

27:36.238 --> 27:40.074
Why do you think Fat Wolf
left the Buffalo Eaters?

27:40.117 --> 27:42.201
How'd he end up
with this band?

27:42.244 --> 27:44.203
Um, met a girl, maybe?

27:47.166 --> 27:51.001
I know it's been years,
but...

27:51.045 --> 27:53.128
you didn't hear
anything about him

27:53.172 --> 27:56.548
when... when you first got
to Toshaway's camp?

27:56.592 --> 27:58.926
Before I got there?

27:58.969 --> 28:02.346
Before you got there...

28:02.390 --> 28:06.392
there was nothing.

28:06.435 --> 28:10.479
No moon, no stars,

28:10.523 --> 28:13.440
no wind in the grasses.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.109
You're not funny.

28:15.152 --> 28:19.279
The world didn't exist
until the great Eli was born.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.950
I'm trying to be serious.

28:22.993 --> 28:24.993
You're very bad at it.

28:26.372 --> 28:29.331
Be happy.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.709
We found a new home.

28:33.212 --> 28:36.046
I think there's bad blood
between Toshaway and his son.

28:38.259 --> 28:40.426
I don't know.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.761
Makes me nervous.

28:42.805 --> 28:45.472
What are you
worried about?

28:45.516 --> 28:47.474
You know Toshaway
and his temper.

28:49.854 --> 28:54.565
Fat Wolf says something,
he's gonna say something back.

28:56.026 --> 28:57.860
If we get exiled...

29:00.072 --> 29:01.864
...the baby...

29:12.209 --> 29:16.670
We can live here
for many years

29:16.714 --> 29:19.047
with our daughter.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.341
You mean our son.

29:21.385 --> 29:22.801
Daughter.

29:22.845 --> 29:24.511
Oh, hold on.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.726
No, no,
it's definitely a son.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.869
You're already
doing it.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.789
I brought you a gift.

29:53.918 --> 29:55.793
It's the best thing
I own.

30:21.028 --> 30:24.112
Toshaway
calls you his son.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.656
Yes.

30:27.159 --> 30:30.077
There are better things
to be.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.121
I'm grateful you
welcomed us here.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.457
It was a hard decision
for you.

30:40.673 --> 30:43.382
I never said
you could stay.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.634
Oh.

30:45.678 --> 30:47.261
No, I guess you didn't.

30:47.304 --> 30:50.389
When I first came
to the Yapuruka kahni,

30:50.432 --> 30:53.892
I had to prove myself,
that I was strong...

30:57.273 --> 30:59.231
That is how
I became Paraiboo.

31:02.111 --> 31:06.071
I know Toshaway,
better than you, I think.

31:06.115 --> 31:09.908
He is weak for now,
but soon he will become strong.

31:14.206 --> 31:19.626
These are my <i> numi,</i>
my people.

31:19.670 --> 31:23.672
And if Toshaway tries
to take them from me,

31:23.716 --> 31:25.424
I will kill him.

32:18.354 --> 32:20.020
Sally.

32:20.064 --> 32:22.648
Hello.

32:22.691 --> 32:25.734
Hi, Maria.

32:25.778 --> 32:28.362
You look well.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.822
How are ya?
Holding up?

32:30.866 --> 32:32.699
I'm good.
Thank you for asking.

32:35.371 --> 32:38.038
Not many people
out today.

32:38.082 --> 32:41.249
Yes, I imagine
most are home

32:41.293 --> 32:43.543
spending time
with their families.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.923
I expect they are.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.716
I'm sorry, um...

32:49.760 --> 32:51.009
I've got errands
to attend to,

32:51.053 --> 32:53.220
but it was nice
to see you, Maria.

32:53.263 --> 32:58.684
You take care, now. Tell your
family Merry Christmas from me.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.060
I will.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.048
Mr. Wentworth?

33:30.092 --> 33:32.092
Mr. Wentworth?

33:32.136 --> 33:34.761
Are you there?

33:34.805 --> 33:37.055
Did I miss a lesson?
Where's Jonas?

33:37.099 --> 33:38.932
No, um, do you
have a telephone?

33:38.976 --> 33:40.809
Yes, uh, but it belongs
to the landlord.

33:40.853 --> 33:42.269
I'm not
supposed to use it.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.104
I'll pay for whatever it costs.
Where is it?

33:44.148 --> 33:45.772
- Uh, well, it's back there.
- Thank you.

33:45.816 --> 33:48.817
Uh, b-but I...
A-Also, uh, it's a mess.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.652
I won't look.

33:58.829 --> 34:00.996
Operator.
Operator, hello?

34:01.040 --> 34:05.000
Yes. I need Austin, Texas,
Riverside 2078.

34:05.044 --> 34:06.084
Hold, please.

34:06.128 --> 34:07.627
Thank you.

34:17.139 --> 34:19.264
Hello?
Marta?

34:19.308 --> 34:21.766
Hi. Yeah,
it's Mrs. McCullough.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.643
Is Mr. Phineas
in the office?

34:23.687 --> 34:25.312
No, ma'am,
he's out right now.

34:25.355 --> 34:28.315
No? Oh, um...

34:28.358 --> 34:31.025
Just when he gets back, have him
give me a call at the ranch.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.610
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.862
Take care. Goodbye.
Yes. Mm-hmm.

34:40.245 --> 34:41.870
Can I come in?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.541
It's your room.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.876
True.

34:50.714 --> 34:52.547
Can I sit?

34:55.886 --> 35:00.055
I'm sorry
about your cattle.

35:00.099 --> 35:02.140
T-That's...
That's why you're so upset.

35:02.184 --> 35:03.517
- Yes.
- Right, yeah.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.061
Um... very scary.

35:06.105 --> 35:08.522
Mm-hmm.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.524
How's Jonas?

35:10.567 --> 35:13.193
Practicin', I hope.

35:13.237 --> 35:16.196
He better be,
given what the lessons cost.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.740
Well, I'm sure
you don't miss it.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.826
I am so sorry.

35:20.869 --> 35:23.036
I thought that that would be
something funny to say,

35:23.080 --> 35:25.664
but that
sounded terrible.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.499
It's all right.
Um...

35:29.545 --> 35:32.671
I should go.
I'm...

35:32.714 --> 35:34.881
Here,
for the phone call.

35:34.925 --> 35:37.259
Oh, no, no, please.
I-I don't want your money.

35:37.302 --> 35:38.885
If I don't give it to you,

35:38.929 --> 35:40.887
I'll probably just light it
on fire or something.

35:44.226 --> 35:45.267
Joking.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.770
Oh, okay, okay.

35:48.814 --> 35:52.190
Hey, can you hold on
for just a minute?

35:52.234 --> 35:56.069
I have something
I want to offer you.

35:56.113 --> 35:59.030
It really helps me
when I'm having a bad day.

36:08.417 --> 36:11.543
I can't sleep sometimes.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.378
Yeah, I just lay here,

36:13.422 --> 36:17.048
and I find myself
thinking about...

36:17.092 --> 36:18.800
About what's happening
in Europe,

36:18.844 --> 36:25.390
or I'll just wander off
thinking about music or the war.

36:25.434 --> 36:27.726
And so I take this,
and, uh,

36:27.769 --> 36:30.604
it just kind of
relaxes me a little bit.

36:30.647 --> 36:33.648
What do you do with it?

36:33.692 --> 36:36.067
You smoke it.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.612
- Please.
- What is it?

36:38.655 --> 36:42.449
Well, the <i> granjeros</i>
call this <i> mota.</i>

36:42.492 --> 36:44.284
So, just take it home
with you.

36:44.328 --> 36:47.245
Might grant you
a little peace of mind.

36:56.297 --> 36:59.966
I know. I know.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.760
You're hungry.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.597
It's okay.

37:05.641 --> 37:08.099
I'm not gonna
let you starve.

37:10.771 --> 37:15.065
You're gonna grow
big and strong.

37:17.194 --> 37:18.443
I know.

37:18.487 --> 37:19.819
How's she doing?

37:19.863 --> 37:22.155
She's hungry.

37:22.199 --> 37:24.491
Why didn't you get her
on Miss Lotty?

37:24.534 --> 37:26.660
I tried.
Lotty wouldn't have it.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.787
She licked a bit
at the milk I threw,

37:28.830 --> 37:31.122
but that's where it ended.

37:34.211 --> 37:36.169
You find out who did it?

37:36.213 --> 37:39.339
Yeah.
Nothin' to worry about.

37:39.383 --> 37:43.009
Some people trying to bully us
into doing business their way.

37:43.053 --> 37:46.680
You going after 'em?

37:46.723 --> 37:48.306
You bet we are.

37:52.062 --> 37:56.273
It's oil, isn't it?

37:56.316 --> 37:58.817
Yeah.

37:58.860 --> 38:01.695
It's like a curse.

38:01.738 --> 38:04.990
If I could just pump it all back
into the ground, I would.

38:07.327 --> 38:11.037
Maybe the Garcías
would still be here,

38:11.081 --> 38:13.540
and this calf would
still have her mama.

38:16.086 --> 38:17.377
And maybe...

38:20.757 --> 38:23.717
Maybe you wouldn't
have left us.

38:23.760 --> 38:27.387
No, sweetheart, no.

38:27.431 --> 38:29.889
None of this is your fault.
It's mine.

38:29.933 --> 38:31.057
Now, don't you
for a second

38:31.101 --> 38:32.892
think you've done
anything wrong.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.811
You're the most wonderful,
thoughtful,

38:34.855 --> 38:37.397
kind little girl
in the whole world.

38:37.441 --> 38:40.734
Everything that feels
upside down 'round here,

38:40.777 --> 38:43.403
that's my fault.

38:43.447 --> 38:47.907
You and Mamma still love
each other, right?

38:47.951 --> 38:49.576
Of course we do.

38:53.457 --> 38:55.040
You believe me?

38:57.294 --> 38:58.752
Good.

39:05.218 --> 39:07.594
What's that
on your neck?

39:07.637 --> 39:11.765
It's a bruise.
I-I, um... I got it in jail.

39:21.610 --> 39:23.943
Hi.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.779
Hi.

39:25.822 --> 39:28.531
We got the mess
cleaned up.

39:28.575 --> 39:30.116
Glad to hear it.

39:30.160 --> 39:34.079
Daddy and I talked to the fella
who hit our stock.

39:34.122 --> 39:36.748
- And?
- Sent a strong message.

39:36.792 --> 39:39.125
Don't expect to see him
back here anytime soon.

39:41.338 --> 39:42.587
Good.

39:48.804 --> 39:51.221
How are things?

39:51.264 --> 39:52.514
Fine.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.522
Uneventful.

40:16.665 --> 40:18.623
Well, now.

40:18.667 --> 40:21.334
This is a surprise.

40:21.378 --> 40:23.670
What can I do for you?

40:23.713 --> 40:26.506
I saw Maria García.

40:26.550 --> 40:28.091
Where?

40:28.135 --> 40:31.845
In town, in Mrs. Carter's
boarding house.

40:31.888 --> 40:33.304
Hm.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.767
Now you know.

40:37.811 --> 40:40.270
I expect you'll do something
about it.

41:17.893 --> 41:19.893
Evening,
Mr. Monahan.

41:22.939 --> 41:25.356
- Mr. Monahan.
- Miss García.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.566
Won't you come in?

41:26.610 --> 41:28.860
Don't mind if I do.

41:42.042 --> 41:43.416
You sure?

41:43.460 --> 41:45.251
He was there to see her,

41:45.295 --> 41:48.546
and she was
expectin' him.

41:48.590 --> 41:51.090
We're gonna need bigger dogs
in this fight.

41:51.134 --> 41:52.342
I'm coming to Austin.

41:52.385 --> 41:53.927
- When?
- Now.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.930
I want a face-to-face tomorrow
with the attorney general.

41:56.973 --> 41:58.389
That's a tall order.

41:58.433 --> 42:00.433
Just get it done.

42:19.162 --> 42:23.206
The bags are
in the back, sir.

42:23.250 --> 42:24.874
Just drive.
