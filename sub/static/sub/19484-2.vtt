<i>As a shoe designer, I have to.</i>

<i>what working with an athlete</i>

it was about jumping,

04:12.168 --> 04:14.337
<i>One of my events was the pole vault,</i>

<i>In order to deal with that,</i>

04:45.118 --> 04:46.786
<i>You have to have this mentality,</i>

04:46.869 --> 04:49.706

<i>What was really great though, for me,</i>

06:02.320 --> 06:07.325
<i>Bill would build me special track spikes</i>

06:07.408 --> 06:08.534

<i>I had no idea how much work</i>
<i>a discipline like Architecture would be.</i>

06:38.189 --> 06:40.858
<i>The good news was</i>
<i>that I found out that I could draw</i>

06:40.942 --> 06:43.194
<i>and it was almost by accident.</i>

06:43.277 --> 06:44.946
<i>That was a pretty big surprise.</i>

06:47.657 --> 06:49.867

in Architecture school here,

07:00.545 --> 07:03.005
I also was doing some work
for Bill Bowerman.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.259
We came across
an actual drawing that I did

07:06.342 --> 07:10.263
of an early design for one
of the very early Nike track spikes.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.599
I just wouldn't just, like,
tell him what I thought,

07:13.683 --> 07:16.394
I would also draw and write down

07:16.477 --> 07:19.939
<i>some of my, I guess you could say,</i>
<i>interpretations of his design.</i>

07:20.565 --> 07:25.153
<i>In this case, he asked me to try out</i>
<i>some track spikes he was working with...</i>

07:25.236 --> 07:26.404
<i>and they didn't work.</i>

07:26.487 --> 07:30.158
<i>They actually unscrewed themselves</i>
<i>every time I would go and train in them.</i>

07:30.658 --> 07:34.162
Unbeknownst to all of us,
I was learning, I guess,

07:34.245 --> 07:39.167
how to design shoes and solve problems
for athletes right off the bat.

07:45.965 --> 07:50.094
<i>Go look at the feet of a pro-athlete</i>
<i>who's played basketball for ten years.</i>

07:51.095 --> 07:53.764
They're trashed,
because their shoes are too tight.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.642
<i>They tie their shoes so tight</i>
<i>because they need them tight,</i>

07:56.726 --> 08:00.271
<i>but they stay that way throughout</i>
<i>all their practices and all their games,</i>

08:00.354 --> 08:05.985
<i>and their feet become deformed and damaged</i>
<i>and sometimes it incapacitates them.</i>

08:06.569 --> 08:09.155
<i>Our studies tell us</i>
<i>that if you take better care of your feet</i>

08:09.238 --> 08:12.200
<i>and get better blood flow,</i>
<i>a better fit and better comfort,</i>

08:12.283 --> 08:13.659
<i>you actually play better.</i>

08:14.494 --> 08:16.245
If you're standing around
for a free throw,

08:16.329 --> 08:19.332
wouldn't it be great
if your shoes loosened up and let your--

08:19.415 --> 08:21.292
let the blood flow back into your feet

08:21.375 --> 08:23.961
<i>and gave your feet a little bit of a rest?</i>

08:24.045 --> 08:27.590
<i>And as soon as the person shoots</i>
<i>the free throw, the shoes know it?</i>

08:27.673 --> 08:29.425
They know you're going to
start moving quickly

08:29.509 --> 08:31.886
and they "zzzim" back up again.

08:31.969 --> 08:35.264
You go sit on the bench.
Why would you leave your shoes tight?

08:35.348 --> 08:37.517
<i>They would just go "zzzz..."</i>
<i>They would relax.</i>

<i>The first person I talked to about it</i>
<i>was really developer Tiffany Beers,</i>

08:53.282 --> 08:57.495
<i>to see if we could even entertain</i>
<i>the idea of starting a project like this.</i>

08:57.578 --> 08:58.496
What did you say?

08:58.913 --> 09:00.498
Well, I said I wasn't sure

09:00.581 --> 09:02.542
-[Tinker chuckles]
-because I didn't report to him.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.502
And so I went and talked to my managers.

09:04.585 --> 09:09.840
They said, "You don't say no to Tinker.
Yeah, you just took the project.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.384

[Beers] <i>We started to focus primarily</i>
<i>on the mechanism.</i>

09:15.263 --> 09:17.014
<i>Like, how do we tighten the laces?</i>

09:17.098 --> 09:21.102
<i>How do we get it small enough that</i>
<i>it's performance and it still looks good?</i>

09:21.602 --> 09:24.313
[Tinker] <i>I think this is</i>
<i>a whole new product design</i>

09:24.397 --> 09:26.023
<i>that will be part of the future.</i>

09:44.667 --> 09:47.336
<i>I think there's art involved in design.</i>

09:47.420 --> 09:49.630
<i>But to me, I don't think of it as art.</i>

09:50.756 --> 09:52.883
<i>My perception of art is that it's really</i>

09:52.967 --> 09:56.846
<i>the ultimate self-expression</i>
<i>from a creative individual.</i>

09:57.680 --> 09:59.348
<i>For me as a designer,</i>

09:59.432 --> 10:04.604
<i>it is not the ultimate goal</i>
<i>to become self-expressive.</i>

10:05.563 --> 10:09.150
<i>The end goal is</i>
<i>to solve a problem for someone else,</i>

10:09.233 --> 10:12.778
<i>and hopefully it looks great</i>
<i>to someone else</i>

10:13.279 --> 10:15.573
<i>and it's cool to someone else.</i>

10:16.073 --> 10:17.575
[upbeat music playing]

10:22.163 --> 10:23.998
This is how design works for me.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.834
I started drawing space.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.254
I was really just trying
to reflect my mood at the time.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.591
I started to have a little bit of fun
with the actual planets

10:33.674 --> 10:35.384
and put faces on them and...

10:35.468 --> 10:36.677
I put George Jetsen.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.097
You know, I have a Volkswagen Bus,

10:40.181 --> 10:43.100
Porsche Speedster,
peace symbols and fingers.

10:43.184 --> 10:46.312
I don't even know why I am doing this,
I'm just doing it.

10:46.395 --> 10:50.775
I drew a cheetah foot that's actually
embedded inside of a sneaker.

10:50.858 --> 10:54.820
And I'm kind of moving through
from that first page of space.

10:54.904 --> 10:58.282
Now I'm getting more specific
about innovation in general.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.535
I remember
somebody telling me it'd be great

11:01.619 --> 11:05.456
if Nike could do shoes that were invisible
and I drew the Invisible Man.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.917
This is just all stuff
that's coming to my head

11:08.000 --> 11:09.126
and I'm just sketching.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.797
All of this stuff ended up
in a drawing of a shoe.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.383
A stream of consciousness
can lead you some place.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.218
You may not even know
where you're headed,

11:17.301 --> 11:21.138
but somehow you end up somewhere,
and here I ended up with a shoe.

<i>They had the right product</i>

<i>was laying people off right and left.</i>

<i>They were also thinking that they needed</i>
<i>to upgrade their design group.</i>

12:00.094 --> 12:04.056

12:16.736 --> 12:17.820

<i>I think, just tried to work off of</i>
<i>what they were already doing,</i>

<i>and it wasn't really anything very unique</i>
<i>in terms of storytelling.</i>

12:25.828 --> 12:28.164

I was <i>told</i> that I was now
a footwear designer for Nike. [chuckles]

<i>I felt like this was an opportunity</i>
<i>to think way differently.</i>

13:01.572 --> 13:05.242
<i>Nike was encapsulating gas</i>
<i>inside a urethane airbag</i>

13:05.326 --> 13:06.911
<i>for a cushioning component.</i>

13:07.620 --> 13:11.290
<i>I thought, "Let's make the bag</i>

13:20.341 --> 13:26.305
seeing Elton John having high-heeled shoes
with a goldfish inside of them.

13:26.388 --> 13:30.184
Right? I mean, it was simply, like,
very... punk even.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.102
[Tinker] <i>I had gone to Paris</i>

13:32.186 --> 13:37.233
<i>and seen a very controversial and loved</i>
<i>or mostly hated building,</i>

13:37.316 --> 13:40.861
<i>The Georges Pompidou Center,</i>
<i>designed by Renzo Piano.</i>

13:42.238 --> 13:46.742
<i>It was a building with all of the inside</i>
<i>mechanics on the outside of the building.</i>

13:47.284 --> 13:51.622
<i>He painted everything in primary colors</i>
<i>just to piss off people even more.</i>

13:53.082 --> 13:55.125
<i>I was very much inspired by that building,</i>

13:55.209 --> 13:58.879
<i>and that's how I ended up</i>
<i>exposing these airbags in the Air Max.</i>

14:00.005 --> 14:02.091
After those sketches came out,

14:02.174 --> 14:06.595
it was widely discussed
that I had pushed it too far.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.431
<i>People were trying to get us fired,</i>

14:09.515 --> 14:12.059
<i>they were screaming</i>
<i>like there was no way in the world</i>

14:12.142 --> 14:16.063
<i>that we could ever sell a shoe</i>
<i>with an exposed airbag</i>

14:16.146 --> 14:18.607
<i>that looked fragile,</i>
<i>like it could be punctured.</i>

14:19.316 --> 14:20.693
<i>The Air Max One took off.</i>

14:20.776 --> 14:22.778
<i>It was an amazing success story</i>

14:22.862 --> 14:25.364
<i>for not just Nike,</i>
<i>but for all of footwear design.</i>

14:25.990 --> 14:28.659
<i>It's built on taking a risk</i>
<i>for a good reason,</i>

14:28.742 --> 14:32.079
<i>which was to tell a story</i>
<i>and to also make a better product.</i>

14:32.788 --> 14:34.790
[funky music playing]

14:44.383 --> 14:46.886
<i>At the same time</i>
<i>that the Air Max came out,</i>

14:46.969 --> 14:50.723
<i>I realized that nobody</i>
<i>was in the right shoe most of the time.</i>

14:50.806 --> 14:53.642
<i>Everybody was trying to play basketball</i>
<i>in running shoes</i>

14:53.726 --> 14:55.936
<i>or trying to run in basketball shoes,</i>

14:56.020 --> 14:58.981
<i>and you would see people getting hurt,</i>
<i>rolling their ankles.</i>

14:59.690 --> 15:04.778
<i>I thought we needed to design a shoe,</i>
<i>and that became their first cross-trainer.</i>

15:05.779 --> 15:07.698
<i>It needed some lateral stability.</i>

15:08.198 --> 15:11.160
<i>There was a mid-foot strap</i>
<i>to strap down that part of your foot,</i>

15:11.243 --> 15:14.121
<i>so then you could participate</i>
<i>in all sports in the same workout,</i>

15:14.204 --> 15:15.789
<i>and not have to change your shoes.</i>

15:16.332 --> 15:19.209
<i>We didn't think</i>
<i>that it was going to sell all that well,</i>

15:19.293 --> 15:22.046
<i>but John McEnroe was having trouble</i>
<i>with his tennis.</i>

15:22.129 --> 15:23.672
[shouting] This is absurd!

15:23.756 --> 15:25.090
I can't believe this!

15:25.925 --> 15:27.134
[shouts]

15:27.217 --> 15:31.055
<i>He decided to wear 'em, and liked them</i>
<i>so much that he wore 'em on television.</i>

15:31.847 --> 15:33.891
<i>That sort of solved the problem of people,</i>

15:33.974 --> 15:37.061
<i>sort of like, "Whoa, that shoe's</i>
<i>so weird. It's so different."</i>

15:37.686 --> 15:40.189
<i>Then you had this push</i>
<i>from the advertising side,</i>

15:40.272 --> 15:43.400
<i>it was all about promoting</i>
<i>the Air Max and the Air Trainer.</i>

15:44.401 --> 15:46.946
<i>We had broken through</i>
<i>some sort of paradigm</i>

15:47.029 --> 15:49.073
<i>in how athletic footwear was designed.</i>

15:50.282 --> 15:52.242
<i>I remember talking to my wife after that,</i>

15:52.326 --> 15:54.954
<i>and I said,</i>
<i>"I think I'm gonna like doing this stuff</i>

15:55.037 --> 15:56.664
<i>if I can just get some sleep."</i>

16:01.001 --> 16:02.461
Now let's see here...

16:08.842 --> 16:12.304
<i>In a lot of ways, design is about</i>
<i>predicting the needs of the future.</i>

16:12.972 --> 16:17.518
<i>The E.A.R.L. self-lacing idea</i>
<i>actually came from my work on a movie.</i>

16:18.435 --> 16:23.399
<i>In 1987, I was asked to get involved</i>
<i>in the </i>Back to the Future<i> series.</i>

16:24.441 --> 16:25.693
[futuristic music playing]

16:25.776 --> 16:31.198
<i>They really needed a special shoe design</i>
<i>that would fit into the year 2015,</i>

16:31.281 --> 16:33.951
<i>which was 25 years in the future.</i>

16:34.451 --> 16:38.288
This is the early storyboards
for the <i>Back to the Future II </i>movie<i>.</i>

16:39.748 --> 16:42.501
<i>They were talking about</i>
<i>magnetic levitation.</i>

16:42.584 --> 16:46.088
<i>"He can stand on the ceiling</i>
<i>or walk up a wall."</i>

16:46.171 --> 16:48.132
<i>It's an old joke. It's an old gag.</i>

16:48.757 --> 16:51.135
<i>I felt like</i>
<i>it shouldn't really be a gag at all.</i>

16:51.218 --> 16:54.972
<i>I wanted something that would actually</i>
<i>excite people about the future.</i>

16:56.348 --> 16:59.560
<i>I just felt like maybe something</i>
<i>that would happen in the future...</i>

16:59.643 --> 17:04.523
Shoes would be smart
and could sense who you were

17:04.606 --> 17:08.652
and when you put it on,
it comes alive and shapes to your foot.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.572
It's your shoe. The shoe knows you.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.074
[whirs, beeps]

17:14.158 --> 17:16.076
Power laces! All right!

17:16.160 --> 17:17.453
[whirs, beeps]

17:18.078 --> 17:20.122
[Tinker] <i>We kept getting requests</i>
<i>over the years</i>

17:20.205 --> 17:21.915
<i>to do the </i>Back to the Future<i> shoe.</i>

17:22.082 --> 17:25.419
And finally in 2006,
I went to Mark Parker and I said,

17:25.502 --> 17:29.757
"You know, why don't we go ahead
and try and make one of these things?

17:29.840 --> 17:32.760
You know,
a replica of that old movie shoe."

17:33.302 --> 17:37.264
The shoe that was on the set
was actually a dummy shoe,

17:37.347 --> 17:40.017
in the sense that
it wasn't actually working.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.979
There was a prop person
who pulled the laces down tight on the set

17:44.063 --> 17:46.148
to make it look like
it was a real working shoe.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.693
But we were always intrigued with,
you know,

17:49.777 --> 17:52.154
actually making a sample that worked.

17:52.780 --> 17:56.742
[Beers] This is the very first working
try-on-able <i>Back to the Future </i>shoe

17:56.825 --> 17:57.785
that we made.

17:57.868 --> 18:01.330
This was from 2007, and back then...

18:01.413 --> 18:02.414
[Tinker] The motor was--

18:02.498 --> 18:04.374
stuff wasn't quite
as small as it is today.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.292
[both laugh]

18:05.375 --> 18:07.294
[Beers] We have to plug it into the wall.

18:07.377 --> 18:10.631
It was either that
or the old car battery in the backpack.

18:10.714 --> 18:14.009
It took a solid year and a half
of just trial and error, trial and error.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.719
And so we'll run this.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.054
[whirring]

18:18.972 --> 18:21.975
I was very proud that we got this far.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.061
I thought, "Oh,
this is going to be amazing."

18:24.144 --> 18:27.606
But we had to wait
for some technology to advance.

18:27.689 --> 18:31.193
So motors had to get a little smaller,
faster, stronger.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.154
We actually put it on pause
for a little while there.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.364
[Tinker] It was great to see

18:35.447 --> 18:39.451
that Tiffany and her team
could get a shoe to do just that,

18:39.535 --> 18:43.831
but clearly it was a long way away
from looking exactly like the movie shoe.

19:09.690 --> 19:16.071
is to kind of force the disruptive nature

[rock music playing]

19:41.597 --> 19:47.227
<i>In 1988, Andre Agassi is gonna be</i>
<i>the next big American tennis star.</i>

19:47.311 --> 19:50.105
<i>I think he was 19 maybe,</i>
<i>and I hadn't heard of him.</i>

19:52.774 --> 19:56.403
<i>I went to Las Vegas,</i>
<i>and I spent some time with him.</i>

19:56.486 --> 20:01.074
He had long hair, kind of,
basically like a long mullet.

20:02.284 --> 20:04.119
<i>He was just very youthful and young</i>

20:04.203 --> 20:07.539
<i>and just not like any tennis player</i>
<i>I'd ever worked with.</i>

20:07.623 --> 20:12.127
Everything in tennis at that time
was kind of the same and boring.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.796
[Tinker] <i>It was a new kind of</i>
<i>style of tennis, which was basically</i>

20:14.880 --> 20:18.217
<i>just get at the baseline</i>
<i>and just hit the ball hard as you can.</i>

20:18.842 --> 20:23.764
<i>I really started to explore</i>
<i>the fact that this young tennis player</i>

20:23.847 --> 20:28.268
<i>did not grow up going to country clubs.</i>
<i>He did not grow up wearing white.</i>

20:29.061 --> 20:31.688
<i>So I'm like,</i>
<i>"Man, this is so unlike tennis."</i>

20:31.772 --> 20:33.732
He not only designed the shoes,

20:33.815 --> 20:37.194
<i>which were quite outrageous,</i>
<i>they were kind of hot pink,</i>

20:37.277 --> 20:38.695
and the outfit was wild.

20:39.571 --> 20:43.533
[Tinker]<i> So we drew Andre wearing</i>
<i>that denim short with a Lycra under-short.</i>

20:44.451 --> 20:47.162
Absolutely meant to be anti-tennis.

20:48.413 --> 20:51.124
I coined the phrase "anti-country club,"

20:51.208 --> 20:53.794

about how you wanted a midcut,

24:57.120 --> 24:58.830
<i>and that became E.A.R.L..</i>

25:01.499 --> 25:02.959
There are many drawings.

25:03.043 --> 25:09.925
Some of them look a bit like hiking boots,
some look like basketball shoes.

25:10.759 --> 25:13.178
[Beers] <i>Once we started getting</i>
<i>the sketches from Tinker,</i>

25:13.261 --> 25:15.430
<i>we knew what the direction</i>
<i>and the focus was.</i>

25:15.513 --> 25:20.393
We literally took the Jordan 28,
and it had a carved-out area underfoot

25:20.477 --> 25:22.062
and we hid the motor under there.

25:22.145 --> 25:26.274
<i>Some of these shoes failed,</i>
<i>some came apart, some broke.</i>

25:26.358 --> 25:30.237
<i>And so we explained all of our problems</i>
<i>to Tinker, and he redesigned it for us.</i>

25:30.737 --> 25:32.405
[Tinker] <i>While we're trying to solve</i>

25:32.489 --> 25:35.450
<i>these problems that Tiffany is finding out</i>
<i>through our wear testing,</i>

25:35.951 --> 25:38.703
<i>I'm now trying to help</i>
<i>refine that process.</i>

25:39.204 --> 25:41.081
[Beers] <i>After we got</i>
<i>the mechanism into here,</i>

25:41.164 --> 25:43.291
<i>we found out that our mechanism</i>
<i>was pretty robust.</i>

25:43.375 --> 25:47.003
Then Mark asked, "Let's put it
in the <i>Back to the Future </i>shoe."

25:47.837 --> 25:50.966
And that's how we get around
to auto-lacing in the MAG.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.218
[Tinker]<i> What was really cool was that</i>

25:53.301 --> 25:56.012
<i>on the same day he put on</i>
<i>the shoe in the movie,</i>

25:56.096 --> 26:01.393
<i>we delivered to Michael J. Fox</i>
<i>the first-ever real-life self-lacing shoe.</i>

26:01.476 --> 26:03.103
2015?

26:04.271 --> 26:05.689
You mean we're in the future!

26:06.273 --> 26:07.607
[high-pitched whirring]

26:07.691 --> 26:09.609
-[Fox] That's insane.
-[Tinker] Isn't that crazy?

26:09.693 --> 26:10.819
That's really great!

26:10.902 --> 26:13.029
Design is-- it just never really stops.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.489
It just sort of keeps on going

26:14.572 --> 26:17.450
and you keep thinking about things
and you keep trying to refine.

26:18.660 --> 26:19.786
<i>I think it's going to change</i>

26:19.869 --> 26:23.498
<i>the way all shoes and all wearables</i>
<i>are going to operate in the future.</i>

26:26.376 --> 26:29.212
-[basketball bouncing]

26:30.422 --> 26:32.173
[Garcia] <i>Here in New York,</i>
<i>where I was raised,</i>

26:32.257 --> 26:34.259
<i>this is the Mecca for sneaker culture.</i>

26:35.260 --> 26:37.012
There were a lot of people in New York
who wore sneakers,

26:37.095 --> 26:39.848
but they basically wanted to wear
what everyone was wearing.

26:39.931 --> 26:43.518
<i>Me and my crew, we wanted to wear</i>
<i>what no one else was wearing.</i>

26:44.185 --> 26:48.440
<i>We were like this early group</i>
<i>of tastemakers determining what was cool.</i>

26:49.107 --> 26:52.527
When the Jordan 1 came out,
we thought it was whack.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.655
<i>Initially, like, corny people wore them.</i>

26:55.739 --> 26:58.742
And the 2 came out. The 2 was, like,
okay, it's an improvement.

26:58.825 --> 27:03.538
Really, like, Tinker Hatfield
saved that whole... scheme,

27:03.621 --> 27:06.833
'cause when he came in
and brought his design to it,

27:06.916 --> 27:09.419
and then Jordan kept on
becoming a better ballplayer,

27:09.502 --> 27:14.382
<i>Jordan had the ability to draw</i>
<i>people's attention beyond the nucleus</i>

27:14.466 --> 27:16.134
<i>of the ballplayer community.</i>

27:16.676 --> 27:22.223
Tinker had a way of somehow
grasping that ethos...

27:22.307 --> 27:24.601
and combining it
with the greatness of Jordan...

27:25.685 --> 27:27.103
and fusing that into a sneaker,

27:27.187 --> 27:29.814
so that by the Jordan 3, 4, 5 and beyond,

27:29.898 --> 27:32.484
<i>the Jordan brand becomes larger than life.</i>

27:32.567 --> 27:33.902
[upbeat music playing]

27:34.402 --> 27:37.155
Practically every time we built a shoe,
it was an improvement.

27:38.239 --> 27:40.658
I felt like it was time
to sort of zig a little bit,

27:40.742 --> 27:42.911
<i>and Michael was like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, baby. Let's do it."</i>

27:42.994 --> 27:46.581
I never wanted heavy shoes.
I always wanted to feel light on my feet.

27:46.664 --> 27:49.084
[Tinker] <i>Michael wants it</i>
<i>to be breathable. I do too.</i>

27:49.167 --> 27:50.877
It was just reinventing mesh.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.129
Along the way, I keep talking to Michael

27:53.213 --> 27:55.632
and trying to riff off of his personality.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.802
<i>I was watching him play one day.</i>

27:58.885 --> 28:01.805
<i>He was kind of floating</i>
<i>around the edges of the game</i>

28:01.888 --> 28:04.891
<i>like a fighter pilot</i>
<i>in a World War II movie.</i>

28:05.392 --> 28:07.394
[gunfire]

28:08.228 --> 28:11.272
<i>They used to put nose art</i>
<i>on World War II fighter planes.</i>

28:11.773 --> 28:13.858
<i>So I put flames on the side of this shoe.</i>

28:13.942 --> 28:16.945
<i>I drew them backwards because</i>
<i>we were always fighting convention.</i>

28:17.028 --> 28:18.780
[Jordan] <i>I want to be different,</i>

28:18.863 --> 28:21.616
but there have been times
when he's been way different.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.285
And I'd say, "Nah, that's not me.
You got to come back a bit."

28:24.994 --> 28:28.289
[Tinker]<i> In '91, he won</i>
<i>the first of six championships.</i>

28:28.373 --> 28:31.251
[TV commentator]
<i>Michael Jordan is the unanimous MVP.</i>

28:31.334 --> 28:32.961
[Tinker] <i>We're always trying</i>
<i>to solve problems</i>

28:33.044 --> 28:34.921
<i>for the best athletes in the world.</i>

28:35.004 --> 28:37.173
<i>But one of the problems</i>
<i>that you run into in design</i>

28:37.257 --> 28:40.802
<i>is how you're going to make it</i>
<i>newer and different from year to year.</i>

28:42.512 --> 28:43.930
<i>People kept lining up for the shoes.</i>

28:44.013 --> 28:45.849
[TV reporter]
<i>They're already proving popular.</i>

28:45.932 --> 28:48.143
[Tinker] <i>And Michael</i>
<i>kept winning championships.</i>

28:48.226 --> 28:49.561
[TV commentator] <i>The Bulls win!</i>

28:49.644 --> 28:53.022
[Jordan] <i>I wear out the right forefoot</i>
<i>or the left forefoot</i>

28:53.106 --> 28:55.442
<i>because of my turning,</i>
<i>because of my agility.</i>

28:55.525 --> 28:57.944
[Tinker] <i>He's 6'6", 210 pounds.</i>

28:58.027 --> 29:00.947
<i>You have to really make sure</i>
<i>that these shoes don't roll over.</i>

29:01.030 --> 29:04.868
I came up with these fingers
that help hold his foot on the platform.

29:06.202 --> 29:08.830
[Jordan] <i>The 10 was one of the shoes</i>
<i>when I retired the first time.</i>

29:08.913 --> 29:10.290
I was playing baseball.

29:10.373 --> 29:11.875
It's time to ride something else.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.837
I was bound and determined
to keep the line going.

29:16.421 --> 29:20.592
<i>I commemorated his ten years as a pro</i>
<i>with these ten stripes.</i>

29:21.718 --> 29:23.720
[Jordan] <i>I wanted</i>
<i>that lifestyle basketball shoe,</i>

29:23.803 --> 29:26.014
where you still play the game
with that shoe,

29:26.097 --> 29:29.642
but then at the end of the day,
you can wear it, you know, with a tuxedo.

29:30.310 --> 29:33.563
[Tinker] <i>We sourced</i>
<i>this really high-quality patent leather.</i>

29:34.189 --> 29:38.067
<i>A few months later, I pull it out of a bag</i>
<i>in a hotel room and show it to him.</i>

29:38.151 --> 29:40.987
He basically says
"Holy shit, that's amazing."

29:42.030 --> 29:44.282
<i>Several months later, he un-retires.</i>

29:45.200 --> 29:47.035
I said, "Don't wear 'em in a game,

29:47.118 --> 29:51.247
because we don't... They're not ready
to go to market or anything."

29:51.331 --> 29:54.000
[TV reporter] <i>Today he will sport</i>
<i>a brand-new pair of shoes.</i>

29:54.083 --> 29:56.753
<i>They're a black patent leather.</i>
<i>They are very stylish...</i>

29:56.836 --> 29:59.255
I just about fell out my chair,
I'm like, "Oh, God. Jeez."

29:59.339 --> 30:01.549
He thought one way, I thought another.

30:01.633 --> 30:05.512
And lo and behold, I won.
[chuckles softly]

30:06.137 --> 30:08.139
[Tinker] <i>You can be inspired</i>
<i>by all kinds of things,</i>

30:08.223 --> 30:11.434
<i>but maybe the most reliable inspiration</i>
<i>is just Michael.</i>

30:11.518 --> 30:15.188
<i>He reminded me</i>
<i>of a powerful predatory cat.</i>

30:15.271 --> 30:17.398
<i>I just call it the Black Cat.</i>

30:17.482 --> 30:20.652
And he goes, "How did you know that?"
And I said, "Know what?"

30:21.402 --> 30:23.279
He goes, "How did you know...

30:23.363 --> 30:28.868
that only my very best and closest friends
have always called me Black Cat."

30:28.952 --> 30:32.163
<i>We were becoming close enough</i>
<i>over these years</i>

30:32.247 --> 30:34.958
<i>that I could communicate with him</i>
<i>on a different level.</i>

30:35.500 --> 30:37.710
<i>We're going through</i>
<i>working on Air Jordans,</i>

30:37.794 --> 30:40.421
<i>and you have to, again,</i>
<i>top yourself each year.</i>

30:41.047 --> 30:45.134
<i>That, to me, is pressure that's healthy.</i>
<i>You need it in order to push yourself.</i>

30:46.344 --> 30:49.848
<i>But on top of all that</i>
<i>was just pure exhaustion.</i>

30:50.557 --> 30:54.561
<i>Just working and traveling</i>
<i>and the hundred-hour weeks</i>

30:54.644 --> 30:58.606
<i>and the missing of children's birthdays</i>
<i>and holidays.</i>

30:59.274 --> 31:00.525
<i>My kids were getting older</i>

31:00.608 --> 31:04.612
<i>and I desperately wanted to spend</i>
<i>more time with them, and my wife too,</i>

31:04.696 --> 31:06.447
<i>and they were really patient.</i>

31:06.531 --> 31:10.952
<i>Right around about the 15th Air Jordan,</i>
<i>I was feeling the effects of that.</i>

31:15.874 --> 31:17.792
[director]<i> The 15 was really</i>
<i>the first Jordan</i>

31:17.876 --> 31:19.168
<i>that had negative reviews.</i>

31:20.086 --> 31:22.422
Was this shoe
somehow a turning point for you?

31:24.674 --> 31:28.511
So, I think this was all about
maybe, uh, designing a shoe

31:28.595 --> 31:33.099
that maybe it wasn't gonna be, uh,
loved by everyone,

31:33.182 --> 31:35.852
but it certainly made a statement.

31:35.935 --> 31:40.189
And there were a lot of things
going on in my life at that time.

31:40.273 --> 31:43.318
I was very, very saddened
by the passing of Bill Bowerman.

31:43.401 --> 31:46.404
My father had passed away
three years before.

31:46.821 --> 31:50.450
And Michael's father had passed away
a few years before, and...

31:50.533 --> 31:53.953
[sighs] you know, a few years back,
and... [stammers]

31:54.954 --> 31:59.876
Just a lot. Yeah, it was a lot going on,
and I was ready to be done.

32:00.877 --> 32:05.465
<i>I was trying to extricate myself</i>
<i>from designing any more Air Jordans.</i>

32:06.132 --> 32:09.928
<i>I was tired. I was kind of worn out,</i>
<i>but also I felt like I'd done enough.</i>

32:10.929 --> 32:14.265
And, um... [clicks tongue]
Bill Bowerman passing away was huge.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.562
[inhales sharply]

32:19.646 --> 32:20.480
[sighs]

32:20.563 --> 32:21.940
[sniffles]

32:22.023 --> 32:23.650
<i>Without the story and the meaning,</i>

32:23.733 --> 32:26.653
<i>you can look at performance</i>
<i>as a driving force,</i>

32:26.736 --> 32:31.240
<i>but these shoes are more than that to me</i>
<i>and, I think, to millions of people.</i>

32:32.033 --> 32:35.370
They have meaning and it might be
different for different people,

32:35.453 --> 32:40.041
but this one and all the other ones
we've just talked about have...

32:40.124 --> 32:41.834
There's a story with each one.

32:41.918 --> 32:46.881
So it's not just scribbling on a piece
of paper and coming up with a design,

32:46.965 --> 32:51.386
it's a lot of effort that goes into trying
to be meaningful.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.933
<i>I did think it was the end</i>
<i>of my shoe designing career.</i>

33:00.311 --> 33:04.357
<i>After that shoe,</i>
<i>I took myself off the Air Jordan line.</i>

33:07.902 --> 33:11.364
Tinker sat in the zone that makes
a lot of people uncomfortable.

33:12.031 --> 33:15.827
And I think that excites him,
but it also creates some stress.

33:15.910 --> 33:18.329
Because you have to own a new direction,

33:18.413 --> 33:23.376
and you have to help people understand
that this is a better way to go.

33:24.002 --> 33:27.213
And that's a huge task,
and it's a big responsibility.

33:27.922 --> 33:29.465
But that's what drives him.

33:29.549 --> 33:31.467
[upbeat piano music playing]

33:36.180 --> 33:37.473
[Tinker] Good job!

33:42.103 --> 33:44.480
<i>I think that when you're younger,</i>

33:45.273 --> 33:47.817
<i>really you're just trying to,</i>
<i>I think, win.</i>

33:49.277 --> 33:50.945
Get it! Oh, dude...

33:51.029 --> 33:52.155
<i>Reaching for glory.</i>

33:52.238 --> 33:54.741
That one wasn't quite as strong of a jump.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.451
Be aggressive about it.

33:57.285 --> 34:00.955
<i>I like to go and coach young people</i>
<i>because I can pass along what I know.</i>

34:01.998 --> 34:05.334
<i>On the surface, you're trying to help kids</i>
<i>go higher in the pole vault.</i>

34:05.418 --> 34:06.294
There you go!

34:06.961 --> 34:10.298
<i>But the real purpose is</i>
<i>to help them overcome fear</i>

34:10.381 --> 34:14.385
<i>and do something they've never done before</i>
<i>and to develop confidence in themselves.</i>

34:14.469 --> 34:17.680
Take that extra momentum
and do something with it.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.057
Get upside down and make it happen.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.351
<i>Even though I'm not finished,</i>

34:22.435 --> 34:25.772
<i>I'd reached this point</i>
<i>where I could continue to be creative</i>

34:25.855 --> 34:27.398
<i>and design products,</i>

34:27.482 --> 34:30.276
<i>but the next step is to actually be</i>
<i>a mentor and a teacher</i>

34:30.359 --> 34:32.278
<i>and maybe inspire people as well.</i>

34:35.406 --> 34:37.450
Oh, whoa! One went up there.

34:38.367 --> 34:39.368
Gotta have two!

34:40.578 --> 34:42.288
I just happen to know that.

34:42.371 --> 34:44.749
It's just... from experience.

35:01.974 --> 35:07.814
<i>In 2005, I came out of Jordan retirement,</i>
<i>and designed the Jordan 20.</i>

35:09.148 --> 35:12.193
I asked him to come back
because 20 was somewhat of a special shoe.

35:12.693 --> 35:15.196
[Tinker] <i>I really wanted to,</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

35:15.279 --> 35:20.827
<i>talk to Michael Jordan about his life</i>
<i>over these past 20 years.</i>

35:21.702 --> 35:23.663
<i>He absolutely did not want to do that.</i>

35:23.746 --> 35:24.997
<i>I said, "Come on, man.</i>

35:25.081 --> 35:27.291
For the first time,
let's just look back a little bit

35:27.375 --> 35:29.085
and that will help us go forward, too."

35:31.546 --> 35:34.882
<i>It became less</i>
<i>about me asking questions...</i>

35:35.383 --> 35:41.973
and just more about him telling me,
like a stream of consciousness,

35:42.056 --> 35:44.934
stuff that was coming into his head.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.770
And I'm, like, taking notes like crazy.

35:49.105 --> 35:53.025
<i>I started to realize</i>
<i>that I could start designing a symbol</i>

35:53.109 --> 35:56.154
<i>that would represent each and every one</i>
<i>of those stories.</i>

35:56.654 --> 35:59.740
There are things in here
that I don't think he ever told anybody.

36:00.908 --> 36:03.202
<i>That became the heart of this shoe.</i>

36:03.828 --> 36:05.663
<i>Some of them are emotional.</i>

36:06.414 --> 36:08.291
<i>And some of them are just funny.</i>

36:08.374 --> 36:11.085
<i>It's really a kind of</i>
<i>an avant-garde approach</i>

36:11.169 --> 36:13.004
<i>to a basketball shoe design.</i>

36:13.087 --> 36:16.674
<i>To me, it's part of what makes it special.</i>
<i>It's really, really out there.</i>

36:17.175 --> 36:20.928
For him to come up with that concept
and then have the consumers connect.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.390
If I had to pick the best
storytelling product we've ever done,

36:24.473 --> 36:25.600
it was probably the 20s.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.936
[Tinker] <i>I think it's one</i>
<i>of my favorite shoes</i>

36:29.020 --> 36:30.229
<i>that I've ever worked on,</i>

36:30.313 --> 36:32.315
partly because of
that wonderful experience

36:32.398 --> 36:35.526
of finally getting Michael
to open up and give me stories.

36:40.948 --> 36:42.241
[upbeat music playing]

36:57.465 --> 36:59.258
[Tinker] What you're about to see

36:59.342 --> 37:03.721
is our very first toe in the water
toward full adaptability.

37:03.804 --> 37:06.265
Just step into the shoe,
it automatically closes.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.934
[Tinker] Who would like to try it on?

37:12.480 --> 37:16.400
When you look at the E.A.R.L., is there
a reason that that shoe should exist?

37:16.484 --> 37:17.318
No.

37:17.401 --> 37:23.115
But like any great thing, you create it,
and then people want it.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.368
What we saw for the tech audience,
two cool things.

37:25.451 --> 37:26.285
Number one thing:

37:26.369 --> 37:29.789
<i>the first self-lacing shoe</i>
<i>for the consumer.</i>

37:29.872 --> 37:31.749
[reporter] <i>Nike looks to one-up rivals</i>

37:31.832 --> 37:34.377
<i>in an increasingly tech-driven</i>
<i>athletic market.</i>

37:34.460 --> 37:37.838
I just want to give you guys
a quick first look at the shoes.

37:38.714 --> 37:40.841
These are definitely
gonna be game changers.

37:41.634 --> 37:42.593
[Tinker] <i>This is step one.</i>

37:43.094 --> 37:45.972
<i>This will become more commonplace</i>
<i>in my opinion.</i>

37:46.055 --> 37:49.642
<i>Is this an important blip in time</i>
<i>in the history of shoes?</i>

37:49.725 --> 37:51.852
<i>I'd say unquestionably.</i>

37:51.936 --> 37:53.187
[explosion]

37:53.271 --> 37:54.146
[heartbeat]

37:54.230 --> 37:55.481
[crowd cheers and applauds]

37:57.191 --> 37:58.651
[gentle guitar music playing]

38:06.409 --> 38:09.662
[Tinker] <i>Before Bill passed away,</i>
<i>he wrote me a note.</i>

38:10.288 --> 38:11.872
<i>The note went like this:</i>

38:14.959 --> 38:19.922
<i>"Tinker Hatfield:</i>
<i>architect, shoe designer, track athlete,</i>

38:20.006 --> 38:21.841
<i>husband and father.</i>

38:22.842 --> 38:26.304
<i>This fulfills the obligations</i>
<i>of the University of Oregon.</i>

38:26.887 --> 38:29.098
<i>Best regards, Bill Bowerman."</i>

38:32.435 --> 38:39.025
I hope someday somebody will take my ashes
and just sprinkle them around the track.

38:39.108 --> 38:43.529
Maybe a little bit on the pole vault pit,
and I'll be happy. [chuckles softly]

38:49.785 --> 38:52.913
<i>I think if you just stay in your studio</i>
<i>and try and dream up new ideas,</i>

38:52.997 --> 38:55.416
<i>there's not a good foundation</i>
<i>for your idea.</i>

38:58.169 --> 39:01.505
<i>Just get out there and experience life.</i>

39:02.923 --> 39:05.426
<i>That just gives you</i>
<i>the library in your head...</i>

39:05.509 --> 39:06.886
[engine revs]

39:06.969 --> 39:10.806
<i>to then translate that</i>
<i>into unique, new design work.</i>

39:10.890 --> 39:13.184
[gentle guitar music continues]

39:20.524 --> 39:22.902
<i>There are many designers out there</i>
<i>that are really great</i>

39:22.985 --> 39:25.738
<i>at refining and interpreting</i>
<i>existing stuff</i>

39:25.821 --> 39:28.199
<i>and moving the needle just a little bit.</i>

39:28.282 --> 39:32.036
<i>And there's a fine art to that,</i>
<i>not overdoing it.</i>

39:35.414 --> 39:39.210
<i>For me, though, my job as a provocateur...</i>

39:40.002 --> 39:43.756
<i>that's all about</i>
<i>thinking further out into the future.</i>

39:54.058 --> 39:57.103
<i>You have to look at</i>
<i>the landscape of the world</i>

39:57.186 --> 39:59.688
<i>and go, "Okay,</i>
<i>I'm going to solve some problems.</i>

39:59.772 --> 40:03.192
<i>I'm gonna add to some design features,</i>
<i>sort of mix it all together,</i>

40:03.275 --> 40:06.404
<i>take a few risks, make a few assumptions</i>

40:06.487 --> 40:08.155
<i>and just blend it all together."</i>

40:13.619 --> 40:16.414
<i>That job does not go without its pitfalls.</i>

40:17.456 --> 40:22.086
<i>But, if people don't either</i>
<i>love or hate your work,</i>

40:23.337 --> 40:25.506
<i>you just haven't done all that much.</i>

40:33.097 --> 40:34.014
