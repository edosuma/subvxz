WEBVTT

00:03.685 --> 00:06.033
Is it a Ferris wheel?

00:06.034 --> 00:08.504
No, how could I fit a Ferris wheel
through the door?

00:08.505 --> 00:11.382
Well, you said it was
something we'd really like.

00:11.383 --> 00:14.504
I also said it was something
that I can fit into my backpack.

00:14.505 --> 00:15.745
Oh, my God.

00:15.746 --> 00:17.967
You got us front-row tickets to Coldplay

00:17.968 --> 00:19.935
at Caesars Palace in Vegas?

00:19.936 --> 00:22.420
No, no, no, no. You're never gonna guess,

00:22.421 --> 00:24.597
so you might as well just open your eyes.

00:25.772 --> 00:27.804
You got an 87 on your spelling quiz?!

00:27.805 --> 00:29.844
Olivia, that is fantastic!

00:29.845 --> 00:31.398
- Practically. 
- What do you mean, practically?

00:31.399 --> 00:32.956
- She's only been reading ten weeks. 
- No,

00:32.957 --> 00:35.537
she spelled "practically."
You spelled "practically."

00:35.538 --> 00:37.073
And "realistic."

00:37.074 --> 00:39.408
I'm so excited,
I could burst into a million pieces!

00:39.409 --> 00:41.369
You guys are so immature.

00:41.370 --> 00:43.518
You know what?
This calls for breaking all the rules.

00:43.519 --> 00:47.206
How about a before-dinner
raspberry cream gelato?

00:48.025 --> 00:50.294
- Or is that too immature? 
- Very funny.

00:50.295 --> 00:51.947
- Come on. Let's get some. 
- Okay.

00:56.346 --> 00:58.557
Sarah, O. aced her spelling quiz.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.888
She even got "beginning" right,
and you know

00:59.889 --> 01:01.973
how tricky that gets right
around the double "n"?

01:01.974 --> 01:03.927
I'm... I'm at Kitty's, and
I'm worried about her.

01:03.928 --> 01:06.472
You should see this place. It's a mess.

01:06.473 --> 01:08.415
And she's doing all the
things that she does

01:08.416 --> 01:09.588
when she's depressed.

01:09.589 --> 01:11.502
She's sitting around watching
reruns of "L.A. law"?

01:11.503 --> 01:13.963
- Worse. "Full house." 
- Ooh.

01:13.964 --> 01:15.599
Well, if your bone marrow
had just recovered

01:15.600 --> 01:17.112
after rejecting itself, don't you think

01:17.113 --> 01:17.992
you'd hunker down to get

01:17.993 --> 01:20.115
- your strength back? 
- No wonder she's glum.

01:20.116 --> 01:23.343
She's living on quinoa and wheat berries.

01:23.754 --> 01:25.987
Not even any wine in the house.

01:25.988 --> 01:27.521
Hang on. That's Scotty's phone.

01:29.862 --> 01:31.437
Oh, it's mom calling for Scotty.

01:31.438 --> 01:34.296
Mom, Olivia got an 87 
in her spelling quiz.

01:34.297 --> 01:36.798
Oh, my gosh. That's wonderful.

01:37.042 --> 01:39.705
What? Look, when she comes over today,

01:39.706 --> 01:41.749
- I'm gonna give her a special treat.
- Slow down.

01:41.750 --> 01:43.433
She already got a gelato out of Scotty.

01:43.434 --> 01:45.490
Well, that's actually who I'm calling...

01:45.491 --> 01:47.315
Maybe I should take her out
to the farmers' market...

01:47.316 --> 01:50.587
- Lily needs to have lamb kidneys
once a week. - Or roast duckling.

01:50.588 --> 01:52.475
It's her favorite,
and if you cook it right,

01:52.476 --> 01:53.927
you can get some of the fat out.

01:53.928 --> 01:55.200
If he knew of butcher that specializes

01:55.201 --> 01:56.668
in obscure internal organs.

01:56.669 --> 01:57.964
Why are you indulging the spoiled bitch?

01:57.965 --> 01:59.306
Give her a bowl of kibble.

01:59.307 --> 02:01.320
Kevin! I can't believe 
you just said that.

02:01.321 --> 02:02.980
I-I'm sorry that I called.

02:02.981 --> 02:05.448
- No, no, no, Sarah, I was talking 
to... ugh. - So, you know...

02:06.943 --> 02:09.733
Oh, my gosh. Oh, gosh.

02:09.734 --> 02:11.456
I... you know what?
I don't know where she is.

02:11.457 --> 02:15.397
I swear to goodness,
if she's chewing on my turkish rug again,

02:15.398 --> 02:17.628
I'm gonna sell her for glue.

02:17.629 --> 02:20.041
I gotta go. I don't know
what she's doing. Okay, bye.

02:21.342 --> 02:23.284
Olivia, thank the lord you don't have

02:23.285 --> 02:26.384
any actual Walker blood
running through your veins.

02:28.564 --> 02:30.430
Kitty, Evan,

02:31.043 --> 02:33.136
how about we go to the farmers' market?

02:33.775 --> 02:35.385
Oh, no. We can't. We can't.

02:35.386 --> 02:37.177
Our favorite episode is on in ten minutes.

02:37.178 --> 02:39.205
You're gonna be mama's
helper and get your juice.

02:39.206 --> 02:40.207
Come on.

02:41.467 --> 02:42.957
There you go. Okay.

02:42.958 --> 02:44.577
You can take that one. Go.

02:44.578 --> 02:46.608
Uncle Jesse!

02:49.750 --> 02:51.290
Uncle Jesse?

02:51.291 --> 02:53.715
Yeah, it's the episode where
Jesse goes skydiving,

02:53.716 --> 02:55.094
and then he lands in a tomato truck

02:55.095 --> 02:57.643
and he's late for his own wedding.
It's very funny.

02:57.644 --> 03:00.175
Yeah. Well, Kitty, if you
don't get out in the world,

03:00.176 --> 03:02.285
you're gonna be late for your own life.

03:02.286 --> 03:04.498
Sarah, if you're worried
about me, don't be,

03:04.499 --> 03:08.215
- because I am fine. 
- I'm not worried. I just miss you.

03:08.519 --> 03:10.242
You know, I miss how we used to hang out.

03:10.399 --> 03:13.230
Really? Is that what you were
whispering to Kevin about?

03:14.052 --> 03:15.847
Okay, I'm a bit worried.

03:16.189 --> 03:19.021
Fine. If you want to worry about me...

03:19.211 --> 03:21.446
You should just worry about my heart.

03:21.606 --> 03:23.954
- Your heart? What's wrong 
with your heart? - No, nothing.

03:23.955 --> 03:27.915
- I'm not talking about
my medical heart. - Seth?

03:27.916 --> 03:29.075
Yeah.

03:29.076 --> 03:29.780
Y...

03:30.882 --> 03:33.441
I hadn't... I didn't realize
that you still...

03:33.442 --> 03:34.870
I still.

03:35.697 --> 03:37.700
Have you talked to him?
Does he know you're back?

03:37.701 --> 03:41.384
No, because when I left, I lied
about the reason I was leaving,

03:41.385 --> 03:43.424
and I haven't called him since
I was gone, and I can't

03:43.425 --> 03:44.928
- just breeze in and breeze out... 
- But

03:44.929 --> 03:47.346
if you have these feelings, I
think you should tell him.

03:47.347 --> 03:51.097
I don't need a door slamming
in my face right now.

03:51.298 --> 03:53.848
- Oh. 
- D-don't you have a wedding to plan?

03:58.711 --> 04:01.218
Yes, I have a wedding to
plan because I took a risk

04:01.219 --> 04:04.105
on a hot younger man that I met in a barn.

04:04.540 --> 04:07.107
Seth's not gonna slam
the door in your face.

04:07.251 --> 04:08.875
How do you know that, Sarah?

04:09.046 --> 04:10.991
There's a knock. He puts down the pen

04:10.992 --> 04:13.076
he's writing his brilliant novel
with, and opens the door.

04:13.077 --> 04:16.829
There stands Kitty Walker...
Repentant and vulnerable,

04:16.829 --> 04:19.935
with her ivory cheeks and her pouty lips,

04:19.935 --> 04:22.740
lanvin booties, the tightest
jeans she's ever owned,

04:22.741 --> 04:25.980
dolce cropped jacket with a
formfitting cashmere sweater.

04:26.424 --> 04:28.443
The only thing 
that man's gonna be slamming

04:28.444 --> 04:31.718
is you against a wall.

04:36.449 --> 04:37.672
Wow.

04:41.702 --> 04:43.507
Did Lily come through here?

04:43.508 --> 04:45.311
Um, negative. Haven't seen her.

04:45.312 --> 04:46.761
I can't find her anywhere.

04:47.538 --> 04:49.621
You sure she's not eating your azaleas?

04:49.622 --> 04:51.501
- No, that was yesterday. 
- Mom.

04:51.502 --> 04:53.471
- Lily, supper time. 
- Hey.

04:53.472 --> 04:56.644
Sup... ma, supper time?
It's not even 4:00 yet.

04:56.645 --> 04:58.594
Well, Brody says his little princess

04:58.595 --> 05:00.093
needs to eat her dinner

05:00.094 --> 05:02.293
long before she takes her evening walk

05:02.294 --> 05:04.211
or she gets crampies.

05:04.212 --> 05:07.378
Hey, you know, uh, mom, you
were never a dog person,

05:07.379 --> 05:09.138
so, uh, who is it 
you're trying to please?

05:09.139 --> 05:12.324
Is it, uh, Lily or the owner?

05:13.023 --> 05:14.900
- What is with you? 
- Nothing, nothing.

05:14.901 --> 05:16.762
Just thinking there might
be a little rekindle,

05:16.763 --> 05:18.317
a little high-school romance.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.271
- Just stop it. 
- When's he coming back?

05:21.272 --> 05:22.194
I don't know. Soon.

05:22.195 --> 05:24.869
Then he can feed his own damn dog. 
Lily!

05:24.870 --> 05:27.655
- Brody. 
- W-would you stop it?

05:27.656 --> 05:30.260
My God. 
Why are you obsessing about this?

05:30.562 --> 05:32.403
Does it have anything to do with the fact

05:32.404 --> 05:36.332
that you are turning a
round-number birthday, hmm?

05:36.333 --> 05:37.860
I'm not in love with your attitude, mom.

05:37.861 --> 05:38.788
- 30. 
- Mom. Brody.

05:38.789 --> 05:39.540
- 30. 
- Brody.

05:39.541 --> 05:40.869
- Lily! 
- Brody.

05:40.870 --> 05:44.189
- Lily! Oh, my God. 
- What?

05:44.190 --> 05:45.747
The door's open.

05:45.794 --> 05:47.323
It wasn't me.

05:52.517 --> 05:54.049
Hello, Olivia.

05:58.388 --> 06:01.347
Liv, don't you recognize me?

06:02.406 --> 06:03.401
Brian?

06:03.402 --> 06:06.574
Yeah, it's me. I'm back.

06:06.575 --> 06:08.443
Oh, my God. I can't believe you're here.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.535
Olivia?

06:17.803 --> 06:19.867
Kevin, Scotty, this is...

06:20.632 --> 06:22.006
Brian, my brother.

06:22.197 --> 06:24.099
I haven't seen him since I was...

06:24.100 --> 06:27.815
- Since you were five. 
- Hi. I'm Kevin Walker.

06:27.816 --> 06:29.141
Hi, Scotty Wandell.

06:29.142 --> 06:30.893
Brian Garcia. Good to meet you.

06:32.613 --> 06:34.051
Where have you been?

06:34.052 --> 06:37.549
A lot of places.
I ended up in the war in Afghanistan.

06:37.816 --> 06:40.357
As soon as I got back, I
started looking for you.

06:40.854 --> 06:43.595
I have so much to tell you.
Can I show him my room?

06:43.596 --> 06:45.965
Or maybe we can take him
to grandma Nora's later.

06:45.966 --> 06:48.021
Tuesday's always grandma Nora day.

06:48.883 --> 06:50.705
Actually, I have to get to work.

06:50.706 --> 06:52.767
I just came by to give you my number.

06:53.583 --> 06:55.645
Call me, okay?

06:56.689 --> 06:58.369
And I'll see you again soon.

06:59.682 --> 07:00.886
I'll call you tonight.

07:01.442 --> 07:02.789
I promise.

07:07.479 --> 07:08.581
Good to meet you guys.

07:14.466 --> 07:15.725
Um... I'm gonna go talk to him.

07:16.354 --> 07:18.009
- Wow. 
- Uh, Brian?

07:19.093 --> 07:21.058
Look, obviously we're really happy

07:21.059 --> 07:24.060
that Olivia's found 
a member of her family,

07:24.413 --> 07:25.931
but, um...

07:25.932 --> 07:28.503
Have you spoken with children's services?

07:28.504 --> 07:31.525
- Do they know you're making
contact with Olivia? - Not yet.

07:31.526 --> 07:34.401
- Right. - I wanted to see if
she'd be happy to see me

07:34.486 --> 07:36.713
before I told them I want
her to live with me.

07:37.571 --> 07:39.374
T... I'm sorry, to live with you?

07:40.070 --> 07:43.009
- Mm-hmm. - Brian, it's great that
you'll be a part of Olivia's life,

07:43.010 --> 07:45.363
but we've adopted her. She's our daughter.

07:45.444 --> 07:48.410
Wow. That's... that's taking
charity all the way.

07:48.411 --> 07:49.683
Charity?

07:50.234 --> 07:52.405
I can't tell you how
grateful I am to you guys

07:52.406 --> 07:54.257
for taking care of her.

07:54.467 --> 07:56.581
But she'll be fine now, because I'm back

07:56.582 --> 07:58.490
and I'm filing to be her guardian

07:59.402 --> 08:01.550
so we can be a family again.

08:23.222 --> 08:25.569
You told us this was a done deal!

08:25.570 --> 08:28.226
I told you that we had 
one more court date

08:28.227 --> 08:29.864
before finalizing the adoption.

08:29.865 --> 08:31.528
Yes, which you said was a formality.

08:31.529 --> 08:33.933
I believe "celebration"
was your exact word.

08:33.934 --> 08:36.586
You said Olivia's brother was
completely out of the picture,

08:36.587 --> 08:38.706
that you've been looking
for him for three years.

08:38.707 --> 08:40.106
Please understand.

08:40.370 --> 08:42.418
When a child ages out of the system,

08:42.419 --> 08:45.305
the department does not
keep any more records.

08:45.476 --> 08:46.908
With the different last names

08:46.909 --> 08:49.572
and the very limited resources,

08:50.161 --> 08:51.771
it fell through the cracks.

08:51.772 --> 08:54.946
And for that, I am truly, truly sorry.

08:54.947 --> 08:57.607
You're sorry?
We're gonna lose her, and you're sorry?

08:57.608 --> 08:59.758
If this guy cares so much
about his little sister,

08:59.759 --> 09:01.882
- where has he been all these years?
- In the army.

09:01.883 --> 09:04.283
In the a... what, they don't
have phones in the army?

09:04.284 --> 09:06.777
Look, normally this case

09:06.778 --> 09:10.546
would take six to eight weeks
to be heard, but we messed up.

09:10.547 --> 09:13.519
I understand, and we don't
want to put you or Olivia

09:13.520 --> 09:15.533
through any more than we have to.

09:15.700 --> 09:18.577
I've called Judge Forrest and asked her

09:18.578 --> 09:20.517
to make room in 
her schedule for tomorrow.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.747
If you'd like to have the case seen then,

09:22.748 --> 09:23.955
- we can... 
- Yes, absolutely.

09:23.956 --> 09:26.753
I don't want this hanging over
Olivia for six to eight weeks.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.274
Is she going to have to testify?

09:30.584 --> 09:33.048
Well, we try not to put the
child in that position.

09:33.049 --> 09:36.374
However, the court will give
weight to what she has to say,

09:36.375 --> 09:38.240
especially a child as old as 9.

09:43.786 --> 09:45.066
So who talks to her?

09:45.390 --> 09:48.846
I will, and if she has
something she'd like to share,

09:49.633 --> 09:51.020
I'll let you know.

09:51.021 --> 09:53.023
She's at Nora's right now.
We thought it'd be better

09:53.024 --> 09:54.859
if she stayed there until this was over.

09:54.951 --> 09:56.085
I'll give her a call there.

09:57.269 --> 09:58.767
What are our chances?

10:03.217 --> 10:05.499
Well, um...

10:07.735 --> 10:10.084
It's entirely up to the judge.

10:10.245 --> 10:12.487
It's very subjective, so she'll decide

10:12.488 --> 10:15.320
what she believes is in the
best interest of the child.

10:15.321 --> 10:17.745
We're in the best interest of the child.

10:18.041 --> 10:21.599
- We're not gonna lose her.
- All right.

10:23.731 --> 10:25.552
Look, I'm gonna get back to the office.

10:25.553 --> 10:27.191
I will give Judge Forrest a call

10:27.192 --> 10:29.135
and let her know to fit you in tomorrow,

10:29.136 --> 10:32.686
and if you need anything, just call.

10:40.638 --> 10:41.910
Thank you.

10:42.633 --> 10:44.035
Good luck.

10:44.036 --> 10:45.106
Thank you.

10:55.795 --> 10:57.419
We're doing the right thing, right...

10:57.989 --> 10:59.255
Fighting this?

10:59.256 --> 11:02.173
- What do you mean? 
- I mean, he's her brother.

11:02.375 --> 11:05.523
Yeah, he's her brother,
and we're her fathers.

11:21.573 --> 11:22.202
Okay.

11:25.082 --> 11:26.250
Kitty.

11:27.068 --> 11:28.552
Hi.

11:29.124 --> 11:32.000
Uh... God. 
God, what... what are you, uh,

11:32.001 --> 11:33.533
what are you doing here?

11:33.831 --> 11:36.908
Well, um, I just really
wanted to talk to you.

11:38.253 --> 11:39.218
Um...

11:40.704 --> 11:42.211
Can I come in?

11:45.133 --> 11:45.929
Um...

11:46.015 --> 11:49.127
I-I promise, if you... if
you just hear me out...

11:49.205 --> 11:52.276
Hear me out, and then if you
want me to go, I'll go.

11:55.991 --> 11:58.298
Okay.

11:58.832 --> 12:00.048
Yeah.

12:05.624 --> 12:07.474
Why couldn't he have come before,

12:07.656 --> 12:09.524
before I met Kevin and Scotty?

12:09.739 --> 12:11.567
Why is everything so messed up?

12:11.865 --> 12:15.265
Olivia, um, were you close
with your brother, Olivia?

12:15.266 --> 12:16.827
I don't remember much.

12:17.021 --> 12:20.095
Well, he went to Afghanistan,
like you, Uncle Justin.

12:20.096 --> 12:21.719
Does that make him a hero?

12:22.331 --> 12:24.734
Uh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

12:26.639 --> 12:27.907
Olivia, are you thinking

12:27.908 --> 12:30.597
- that maybe you'd like to
live with your brother? - Mom.

12:30.598 --> 12:34.121
Oh, I-if you feel that way,
honestly, you can tell us.

12:34.122 --> 12:37.628
I don't know. How could I do
that to Kevin and Scotty?

12:38.431 --> 12:40.553
Sweetheart, listen...

12:40.554 --> 12:42.669
Kevin and Scotty love you.

12:42.670 --> 12:45.229
They... they want what's best for you.

12:45.422 --> 12:47.963
And then there's Brian. 
He's my brother.

12:47.964 --> 12:49.960
I don't want to hurt him, either.

12:50.409 --> 12:52.439
What difference does it
make what I think anyway?

12:52.440 --> 12:54.799
Well, it makes a difference.
It makes a big difference.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.714
That's why Jill talked to you about it.

12:56.715 --> 12:58.302
What you think and feel makes a difference.

12:58.303 --> 13:00.584
Everyone wants to know
what you have to say.

13:00.585 --> 13:03.516
I already told Jill, I don't
know what I want to say.

13:08.638 --> 13:11.788
- Would you like to invite your
brother over today... - Mom.

13:11.789 --> 13:14.446
so that you two could get to
know each other a little better?

13:16.263 --> 13:18.074
Yeah. Maybe it would help.

13:19.684 --> 13:20.893
All right.

13:21.039 --> 13:22.040
Okay.

13:22.404 --> 13:23.875
Then that's what we'll do,

13:24.318 --> 13:25.535
right after we finish this.

13:29.938 --> 13:33.202
Wow. Okay, so, um, you...
you're all right now?

13:33.203 --> 13:35.174
The medication has it all under control,

13:35.175 --> 13:37.264
and... and I feel great.

13:38.633 --> 13:40.750
W... I just...

13:40.920 --> 13:42.636
Something that important, I just...

13:42.864 --> 13:44.693
How could you not 
have told me the truth?

13:44.694 --> 13:47.614
I just didn't want you to
feel obligated to be with me

13:47.615 --> 13:48.804
just because I was sick.

13:48.805 --> 13:50.744
I didn't want you to
have to go through that.

13:50.745 --> 13:52.416
But you didn't give me a chance, Kitty.

13:52.572 --> 13:55.919
Okay, okay, but if it makes
you feel any better,

13:55.920 --> 13:57.180
I didn't tell anyone.

13:57.181 --> 13:58.644
It doesn't.

13:59.274 --> 14:01.056
I thought of you every day.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.870
- Then why didn't you call? 
- I don't know.

14:03.871 --> 14:07.757
I guess I was lying to myself
as much as I was lying to you.

14:07.758 --> 14:10.919
I just wasn't ready to accept
what was happening to me,

14:10.920 --> 14:14.706
and... and now I am finally accepting it.

14:14.707 --> 14:16.441
So here I am.

14:17.798 --> 14:20.408
Awesome news, babe!
Okay, I did the whole "please,

14:20.409 --> 14:22.020
"please, my boss will fire me,
and I'll have to live in my car

14:22.021 --> 14:22.934
if you don't give me a table," thing,

14:22.935 --> 14:26.046
and snagged us an 8:00 at Felix.
Yeah, tomorrow night,

14:26.047 --> 14:29.629
- not six months from now. 
Genius!- Oh!

14:31.504 --> 14:32.541
Um...

14:34.846 --> 14:37.501
Uh, uh, uh, uh, Kitty,
this is, um, Berklee.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.381
- Berklee, this is... - Oh, we
know each other, silly

14:39.382 --> 14:41.892
- I was in her class. 
- She was in my class.

14:41.893 --> 14:45.286
Yeah. Oh, my God.

14:45.575 --> 14:49.106
You guys totally dated, didn't you?

14:49.107 --> 14:51.642
- Yeah. - You know what?
You should just join us,

14:51.643 --> 14:55.114
and I could totally change
the reservation for three.

14:55.115 --> 14:56.861
Uh, uh, nope. I don't think that's...

14:56.862 --> 14:58.809
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

14:58.810 --> 15:01.942
No. Ahem. That is so nice of
you, and thank you very much.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.541
. But I-I-I have plans, and... and... 
- Mm.

15:04.977 --> 15:06.679
I should get going.

15:07.501 --> 15:09.390
Um, I'll... I'll see ya.

15:09.391 --> 15:10.889
Bye.

15:15.406 --> 15:17.021
What is she doing here?

15:27.113 --> 15:30.452
Humiliating doesn't even
begin to describe it.

15:30.626 --> 15:32.012
Evil skank.

15:32.013 --> 15:33.763
Oh, she was probably
standing outside the door

15:33.764 --> 15:35.758
the whole time I was baring my heart.

15:35.759 --> 15:38.406
And then she comes in, Sarah,
and she's all, like,

15:38.407 --> 15:40.144
"oh, sweetums.

15:40.145 --> 15:43.662
"Guess who snagged us a table
at Felix for tomorrow night.

15:43.663 --> 15:46.686
Isn't your little Berklee a genius?"

15:47.046 --> 15:48.849
And then she had the audacity

15:48.850 --> 15:52.213
- to ask me to come along.
- Her name is not actually Berklee?

15:52.214 --> 15:54.706
It is, with two stupid
little e's at the end.

15:54.707 --> 15:58.838
She was in my class, Sarah.
She is so not of his caliber.

15:58.996 --> 16:00.868
Well, it sounds like you'll
have to get him back.

16:00.869 --> 16:02.599
Forget about it. It's too late.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.927
Fine. Sit there and feel
sorry for yourself.

16:04.928 --> 16:06.603
Well, okay.

16:10.776 --> 16:16.411
You could take them up on their
very kind offer for dinner.

16:16.412 --> 16:18.840
- Why would I do that?
- Because this little Wellesley...

16:18.841 --> 16:21.985
- Berklee. - Whatever... is about 
to suffer the same fate

16:21.986 --> 16:23.990
as Susie Eisenbloom.

16:23.991 --> 16:26.539
When Ricky Spotsner invited me

16:26.540 --> 16:28.759
to the homecoming semiformal dance...

16:28.760 --> 16:30.279
In twelfth grade.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.592
- That South pas little slut
Susie snaked him away. - Well...

16:33.593 --> 16:35.996
I was ready to give up,
lock myself in a room

16:35.997 --> 16:37.497
reading "the French lieutenant's woman"

16:37.498 --> 16:39.676
sobbing into my pillow,
but you did not let me.

16:39.677 --> 16:43.985
- You were my hero. - All I did was
give you a tiny little pep talk.

16:43.986 --> 16:46.461
No, you found out that...

16:46.462 --> 16:48.163
that the robot...

16:48.164 --> 16:50.210
was Ricky's go-to dance.

16:50.211 --> 16:54.511
And you coached me, and I
found my inner robogirl, hmm?

16:54.512 --> 16:57.247
Yeah, and I loaned you my
little velvet miniskirt

16:57.248 --> 16:59.912
from Judy's at century city.
You looked hot in that.

16:59.913 --> 17:03.454
And you got me out of my room,
and you got me to the dance.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.737
Yes, yes, you boogied your ass off.

17:05.943 --> 17:09.744
- And who... did Ricky drive
home that night? - You.

17:09.746 --> 17:11.897
- That would be me.
- Okay, but that's not gonna happen.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.368
- I could go with you.
- Sarah, she did not invite you.

17:14.369 --> 17:15.906
- We'll get our own table. 
- No.

17:15.907 --> 17:17.157
- You, me, and Luc. 
- No.

17:17.159 --> 17:20.606
Yes. We'll be your wingmen.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.490
And while we're waiting for cocktails,

17:22.491 --> 17:25.373
you will sashay your sweet
little tush over to Seth's table

17:25.374 --> 17:26.845
in your 4-inch heels,

17:26.846 --> 17:29.223
your black Valentino with the lace cutouts

17:29.224 --> 17:31.644
the same way that I boogied
my way into that gym.

17:31.645 --> 17:35.377
And you will show him who is
the true owner of his heart.

17:35.592 --> 17:36.819
Come on, Kitty. You and I both know

17:36.820 --> 17:38.630
that this little teacake
is no match for you.

17:38.631 --> 17:40.997
No! No, Sarah. This is crazy.

17:40.998 --> 17:42.811
We cannot do this.
We are not in high school.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.262
No, we're not, but Seth is, practically.

17:45.263 --> 17:47.165
Okay, no, he is not,

17:47.166 --> 17:50.433
and I am getting very, very
tired of the age jokes.

17:50.434 --> 17:52.984
Seth is a month away 
from getting his PhD,

17:53.273 --> 17:56.186
and he is smarter and more mature

17:56.187 --> 17:58.708
than 90% of the guys that I
have ever met in my life,

17:58.709 --> 18:00.834
and he makes Evan laugh,

18:00.835 --> 18:04.963
and he reads T.S. Eliot in bed...

18:05.664 --> 18:07.150
Beautifully.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.616
So we're doing this?

18:10.617 --> 18:12.409
Damn right, we are.

18:16.448 --> 18:19.044
You invited her brother to your house?

18:19.045 --> 18:21.304
Well, actually, Olivia invited him.

18:21.305 --> 18:24.340
It's because you decided to tell
her it was all up to her, mom.

18:24.341 --> 18:26.594
She should have a voice in this.

18:26.595 --> 18:29.463
Right now, she's confused.
She doesn't know what to think.

18:29.464 --> 18:31.444
Mom, you have to cancel this.

18:31.641 --> 18:34.164
You should not have put the
burden to decide on her.

18:34.165 --> 18:36.320
But she's already burdened, Kevin.

18:36.321 --> 18:38.066
She feels, no matter what happens,

18:38.067 --> 18:40.367
somebody's gonna be hurt, and
it's gonna be her fault.

18:40.368 --> 18:42.284
Which is exactly why it
shouldn't be her decision.

18:42.285 --> 18:44.185
And what if she decides
for the wrong reasons...

18:44.186 --> 18:46.119
Out of guilt or just
because he's her brother?

18:46.120 --> 18:49.129
Mom, not everybody who goes
to Afghanistan is a hero.

18:49.340 --> 18:51.373
All right? Trust me.
We had our fair share of dirtbags.

18:51.374 --> 18:53.702
You know what, mom?
Please stay out of this.

18:53.745 --> 18:55.199
Don't you have a lost dog to find?

18:55.244 --> 18:57.318
Yes, Kevin, I have a lost dog to find.

18:57.319 --> 19:00.508
And don't change the subject.
Look, whether Olivia's brother

19:00.509 --> 19:03.457
is a... is a hero or a
dirtbag is irrelevant.

19:03.650 --> 19:05.358
She has a right to know him.

19:05.359 --> 19:08.091
What can she possibly learn
about him in half an hour?

19:08.092 --> 19:10.535
- This isn't speed dating.
- She has been kicked around

19:10.536 --> 19:12.665
like a lost dog since 
she was 3 years old.

19:12.666 --> 19:13.959
We're offering her a home and safety

19:13.960 --> 19:16.566
for the first time in her life,
and what, some 23-year-old kid's

19:16.567 --> 19:18.799
gonna drop from the sky and
just take that way from her?

19:18.800 --> 19:22.254
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm on Olivia's side, Kevin.

19:22.255 --> 19:25.362
- Yeah. - This is her life.
She has a right to participate in it.

19:27.844 --> 19:28.663
It's Kitty.

19:28.664 --> 19:30.315
No! No. Don't talk to her about this.

19:30.316 --> 19:31.681
And don't tell Sarah either,

19:31.682 --> 19:33.611
'cause she'll just tell her, and
then they'll both flip out,

19:33.612 --> 19:35.725
and I have plenty of people
flipping out right now.

19:37.434 --> 19:40.503
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to prep for this case.

19:40.704 --> 19:41.777
I hope I can take care of it

19:41.778 --> 19:43.897
without dragging Olivia through it.

19:49.304 --> 19:50.893
Your honor, thank you for taking the time

19:50.894 --> 19:53.510
to hear us at such short
notice in your chambers.

19:53.511 --> 19:54.150
I'm going to move

19:54.151 --> 19:56.921
that Mr. Garcia's motion
of custody be dismissed.

19:57.339 --> 19:59.967
Mr. Wandell and I 
were one formality away

19:59.968 --> 20:02.595
from finalizing our adoption of Olivia.

20:02.942 --> 20:03.916
Both the court

20:03.917 --> 20:05.419
and the department of children's services

20:05.420 --> 20:07.208
had completely signed off on us,

20:07.209 --> 20:09.291
and their trust had proven well-founded.

20:09.474 --> 20:12.394
Since Olivia's been with us,
she has come out of her shell,

20:12.395 --> 20:14.473
she's laughing, she's learned to read.

20:14.474 --> 20:18.325
She's in a safe, stable home
in which she's thriving.

20:18.811 --> 20:22.371
We both believe, uh, that a
change in custody at this time

20:22.372 --> 20:24.653
would be catastrophically
disruptive to her.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.305
Thank you.

20:26.418 --> 20:27.679
These are all valid points,

20:27.680 --> 20:29.550
which I will want to hear more about.

20:29.982 --> 20:32.485
I would also like to hear 
Mr. Garcia's case.

20:32.677 --> 20:34.593
I'm going to deny your motion to dismiss

20:34.594 --> 20:36.005
and proceed with this hearing.

20:36.423 --> 20:38.678
Would counsel for Mr. Garcia 
like to begin?

20:38.679 --> 20:40.834
Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.

20:40.835 --> 20:44.789
We'll be presenting letters from
Mr. Garcia's employer,

20:45.129 --> 20:47.724
his landlord, and his
former commanding officer

20:47.725 --> 20:49.592
in the United States army.

20:50.032 --> 20:51.100
But first...

20:51.296 --> 20:53.057
- Mm-hmm. - My client has a
statement he'd like to make,

20:53.058 --> 20:55.262
- if that's all right. 
- Of course.

20:55.263 --> 20:56.462
Mr. Garcia.

20:57.231 --> 20:59.797
Your Honor, I'm making
this opening statement

20:59.798 --> 21:02.175
because I want to talk
to you from my heart.

21:02.346 --> 21:03.972
I had some dark days in my teens,

21:03.973 --> 21:07.014
but the army got me together,
and now I have a good job,

21:07.015 --> 21:09.034
and I know in my heart that I am ready

21:09.035 --> 21:11.038
to take care of Olivia now.

21:13.604 --> 21:16.114
Maybe Mr. Walker and Mr. Wandell

21:16.115 --> 21:19.002
have more money than I do,
maybe they can buy Olivia

21:19.003 --> 21:21.508
nice things that I can't, but...

21:22.138 --> 21:24.078
The lifestyle they've chosen,

21:24.079 --> 21:26.661
that's not the values that I believe in

21:26.662 --> 21:29.534
and not the values I want my
sister to be raised with.

21:29.798 --> 21:33.330
It's wrong for two men
to be raising a child.

21:33.331 --> 21:35.180
Uh, Your Honor, may I speak?

21:35.239 --> 21:37.792
- Yes, Mr. Walker.
- I'm sure Your Honor's aware,

21:37.869 --> 21:40.253
both state and federal
statues prevent the court

21:40.254 --> 21:42.268
from making any custody decision

21:42.269 --> 21:43.938
based on religion, ethnicity,

21:43.939 --> 21:47.012
- or lifestyle. 
- Mr. Walker, I can assure you,

21:47.013 --> 21:49.127
I'm well-aware of those statutes.

21:49.633 --> 21:52.079
Continue, Mr. Garcia.

21:52.326 --> 21:54.039
I was almost done, Your Honor.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.890
I just wanted to say that
I'm hoping you'll read

21:56.891 --> 21:59.252
what the people in my
life have to say about me

21:59.572 --> 22:01.432
and let my sister come home.

22:14.450 --> 22:16.437
Kevin, please call me back.

22:16.438 --> 22:19.424
Scotty told me what happened
in court today. I'm...

22:20.223 --> 22:21.944
Ooh, I have to take this call.

22:21.945 --> 22:25.553
So, um, I love you. Call me back.

22:26.307 --> 22:27.176
Hey, mom.

22:27.177 --> 22:28.563
Hi, Brody.

22:29.453 --> 22:30.832
No, I'm fine.

22:31.331 --> 22:33.220
Lily's fine.

22:33.894 --> 22:35.554
- Mom. 
- You know, I can't talk right now.

22:35.555 --> 22:39.860
So, uh, call me back. Bye. Ugh.

22:40.636 --> 22:43.009
Ugh. I can't believe I
haven't told him yet.

22:43.010 --> 22:44.829
God. What a day, huh?

22:44.999 --> 22:45.975
Yeah.

22:47.737 --> 22:49.730
What's all this?
Brian's not still coming, is he?

22:50.021 --> 22:52.598
Yes. He'll be here in a few hours.

22:52.599 --> 22:54.653
What? Mom, after what he said in court?

22:54.654 --> 22:55.720
He's a bigot.

22:55.721 --> 22:58.214
Just because someone has
different values than you,

22:58.215 --> 23:00.789
it does not disqualify
him from being a parent.

23:00.790 --> 23:03.422
- You don't give up, do you, mom?
- He is Olivia's brother.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.283
- We should all get to know him. 
- Okay,

23:05.284 --> 23:07.525
there are some people that
you can't make peace with.

23:07.571 --> 23:09.939
We've had this conversation before, Justin.

23:09.940 --> 23:12.673
Yeah, we have, when you thought
sanctions or some such crap

23:12.674 --> 23:15.386
would stop people from flying
planes into buildings, mom!

23:15.387 --> 23:17.708
So if this turns out to be a war,

23:17.709 --> 23:20.713
then the collateral damage will be Olivia.

23:20.714 --> 23:21.518
Okay, fine. You know what?

23:21.519 --> 23:23.713
- If he's coming, I'm talking to him
man-to-man. - No, you're not.

23:23.714 --> 23:25.407
Yes, I know how to get
through to this type of guy,

23:25.408 --> 23:27.431
and if you can trust Olivia, 
you can trust me.

23:35.681 --> 23:37.197
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

23:37.198 --> 23:40.863
Okay, don't look now, but I am 75% sure

23:41.197 --> 23:43.292
that is Benjamin Millipede.

23:44.130 --> 23:46.231
Uh-huh. Well, it wouldn't make
a difference if I did look,

23:46.232 --> 23:47.920
'cause I have no idea who that is.

23:47.921 --> 23:50.830
Um... Natalie Portman's baby daddy.

23:50.831 --> 23:53.588
- Mm. 
- Seth, I have so much to teach you.

23:58.852 --> 24:00.986
Oh, well, who is it now?

24:01.111 --> 24:03.940
Um, it's just some underwear model.

24:04.779 --> 24:07.131
But you wouldn't know that
because you wear boxers

24:07.132 --> 24:09.327
- that come in six-packs. 
- Hey.

24:28.489 --> 24:30.224
Hi. You actually came.

24:30.225 --> 24:34.235
Yes, I actually came because
you actually invited me.

24:35.428 --> 24:38.072
Oh. Or... or was she just kidding?

24:38.073 --> 24:40.362
No, not at all. I am, um,

24:40.363 --> 24:43.916
I'm just... I'm so glad to see you here.

24:43.917 --> 24:44.745
Mm.

24:45.095 --> 24:47.584
Um... Kitty, uh, I-I thought

24:47.585 --> 24:49.382
you had other plans.

24:49.383 --> 24:52.650
I did. I did. I had plans with
my sister and her fiancé.

24:52.651 --> 24:55.074
But my sister has always
wanted to come here,

24:55.075 --> 24:58.230
so when Berklee mentioned it, 
I thought, well, wow.

24:58.231 --> 24:59.899
Okay, well, tonight's the night.

25:03.751 --> 25:05.197
Right, right. 
You know, they're actually...

25:05.198 --> 25:07.079
- Well, enjoy your... your meal.
- waiting for me, yes.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.767
Yeah, you should, and... and
I just want to tell you

25:08.768 --> 25:11.892
how cool I think it is
that you and your sister

25:11.893 --> 25:14.431
would brave a place like this.

25:14.432 --> 25:17.551
I mean, my mom always says, when
she comes to places like this,

25:17.552 --> 25:21.283
- it gives her an acute midlife crisis.
- Really?

25:21.284 --> 25:24.092
Yeah. Excuse me.

25:24.093 --> 25:25.557
Oh, she's sitting down.

25:25.973 --> 25:27.469
Actually, they look like they're having

25:27.470 --> 25:29.243
a very romantic moment,

25:29.244 --> 25:31.098
so I'm gonna just hang out with you two

25:31.099 --> 25:32.834
until our food comes.

25:32.835 --> 25:35.646
And to tell you the truth... ugh...

25:35.647 --> 25:38.063
I am starving already.

25:38.605 --> 25:39.615
Mmm.

25:39.780 --> 25:40.854
Mm.

25:41.285 --> 25:44.983
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

25:45.686 --> 25:47.120
I'm starving.

25:47.787 --> 25:49.287
Kitty, what are you...

25:49.288 --> 25:53.205
What? Oh, please.
She doesn't need the calories.

25:54.503 --> 25:55.473
Mm.

25:56.452 --> 25:57.308
Ooh.

25:57.309 --> 25:59.716
Bold move.

25:59.717 --> 26:02.156
That tastes better than wheatgrass.

26:03.358 --> 26:04.807
What's that French for?

26:04.808 --> 26:06.743
I hope it doesn't blow up at your face.

26:06.744 --> 26:09.278
- Blow up in your face. 
- Whatever.

26:09.279 --> 26:11.655
For Kitty's sake, I hope
it does not do that.

26:11.656 --> 26:13.769
Oh, come on. 
Lighten up and enjoy the game.

26:19.700 --> 26:20.828
Brian, right?

26:20.829 --> 26:22.413
Hey, I'm, uh, I'm Justin Walker.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.185
Come on in. Nice to meet you, Justin.

26:24.186 --> 26:25.346
Nice to meet you, too.

26:29.116 --> 26:30.532
Nice house.

26:30.533 --> 26:31.887
Oh, thanks.

26:33.150 --> 26:34.571
So I-I heard you, uh,

26:34.572 --> 26:36.335
you did a tour in Afghanistan.

26:36.429 --> 26:38.373
Yeah. Liv told me you were there, too.

26:38.374 --> 26:39.942
I was, I was.

26:42.284 --> 26:43.490
Where is she?

26:43.491 --> 26:44.876
Oh. Uh, she... she's upstairs.

26:44.924 --> 26:46.440
My, uh, my mom went to get her.

26:48.347 --> 26:51.782
Listen, I...
I heard what you said to the judge.

26:51.783 --> 26:55.086
And, um, you know, who knows
if... if my brother weren't gay,

26:55.087 --> 26:57.315
maybe I'd feel the same way, but...

26:57.316 --> 26:59.150
I really don't want to talk about that.

27:01.258 --> 27:02.464
Okay. Look, um...

27:03.177 --> 27:05.945
I know you haven't seen
Olivia in a long time.

27:05.993 --> 27:08.350
But the truth is, when she came here,

27:08.351 --> 27:10.064
she was in pretty bad shape.

27:10.779 --> 27:13.618
So I was wondering if you'd
like to take your time

27:13.619 --> 27:15.312
and... and maybe see how happy she is

27:15.313 --> 27:18.338
and... and how great Kevin
and Scotty are with her.

27:18.339 --> 27:21.951
I appreciate all of that.
But I'm her brother, her blood.

27:21.952 --> 27:24.541
Of course. And, you know,
you'll be in her life forever.

27:26.129 --> 27:27.901
Generous of you to say so.

27:28.048 --> 27:30.388
Yeah, I-I didn't... I
didn't mean it like that.

27:30.389 --> 27:33.639
This is about how I want
my sister to be raised.

27:33.991 --> 27:35.246
I'm not the only person in the world

27:35.247 --> 27:37.199
who thinks what they're doing is wrong.

27:39.757 --> 27:40.621
So tell me something.

27:40.622 --> 27:43.050
Would you be doing this if
Kevin and Scotty weren't gay?

27:44.280 --> 27:45.672
I told you,

27:45.892 --> 27:47.510
I don't want to talk about it.

27:49.507 --> 27:50.915
I'll get Olivia.

27:54.612 --> 27:57.394
So what ever happened to Aunt Gloria?

27:57.747 --> 27:58.958
I don't know.

27:59.536 --> 28:02.210
We kind of lost touch a long time ago.

28:02.581 --> 28:04.309
Great. You found everything.

28:04.310 --> 28:05.737
But let me get this.

28:05.963 --> 28:07.138
This looks great.

28:07.139 --> 28:08.740
- Thanks. 
- Sure.

28:10.531 --> 28:11.683
Brian...

28:17.362 --> 28:19.960
Olivia, look, go ahead. Talk to him.

28:19.961 --> 28:22.281
He's your brother.
You can ask him anything.

28:26.029 --> 28:27.081
If I were to live with you,

28:27.082 --> 28:30.217
I would still be able to visit
Kevin and Scotty, right?

28:30.632 --> 28:32.429
I mean, I could still
go over to their house

28:32.430 --> 28:36.295
and do my homework in the caffee, 
couldn't I?

28:39.352 --> 28:41.137
Kevin and Scotty have been...

28:41.778 --> 28:44.035
very nice foster parents.

28:45.650 --> 28:48.192
But you and I are going 
to be a family now.

28:56.761 --> 28:59.064
So did you guys happen to
see that amazing article

28:59.065 --> 29:01.850
- on Norman Mailer in the
"Manhattan register"? - Mm.

29:01.851 --> 29:03.938
- Slipped right by me. 
- Of course it did.

29:06.575 --> 29:09.669
Oh, my gosh. Oh, I know what
I've been dying to tell you.

29:09.869 --> 29:11.997
I meet this lawyer in D.C.

29:11.998 --> 29:14.153
Right out of your story
about the accountant,

29:14.154 --> 29:15.649
right down to the dandruff...

29:15.820 --> 29:18.084
How do you think it's going? I can't tell

29:18.085 --> 29:19.361
if she's... if she's on a roll

29:19.362 --> 29:21.733
or if she's talking herself into a ditch.

29:22.067 --> 29:24.878
Sarah, don't ask me. 
You know what I think.

29:25.203 --> 29:27.822
He's listening, right, though?
He seems attentive?

29:29.749 --> 29:32.008
Well, maybe he should be
more attentive to his date,

29:32.009 --> 29:34.472
because his date is 
being attentive to me.

29:34.634 --> 29:36.057
What are you talking about?

29:36.058 --> 29:37.511
Look. She's checking me out.

29:37.512 --> 29:40.692
Ohh. Fun time is over. 
This... this is war.

29:40.693 --> 29:42.897
Just get her to join you at the bar.

29:42.898 --> 29:45.377
- Why me? 
- Because you're my secret weapon.

29:45.378 --> 29:47.805
Are you out of your mind?
Why would she do that?

29:47.853 --> 29:49.503
You don't know your own power.

29:50.150 --> 29:53.542
Please. Get her to the bar.
Take one for the team.

29:57.417 --> 29:58.873
For Kitty. For Kitty.

29:58.874 --> 29:59.917
Okay.

30:00.082 --> 30:02.538
- Thank you. 
- Wait. Wait. Where are you going?

30:02.539 --> 30:06.823
To the bathroom, leaving my
gorgeous fiancé unattended.

30:06.918 --> 30:09.174
The rest is in your capable hands.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.131
I really thought it was, like,
mean-spirited, you know?

30:17.132 --> 30:18.104
Oh, me, too. Terrible.

30:18.105 --> 30:20.512
Terribly mean-spirited.

30:20.513 --> 30:24.383
It was just envy 
of a true writer's talent.

30:24.384 --> 30:27.842
And you really need to come clean
with me and tell me the truth.

30:27.843 --> 30:31.153
The story that you wrote about the
lost girl in San Francisco,

30:31.206 --> 30:34.274
was it all happening in
her head, or was it real?

30:34.275 --> 30:36.053
Uh, you know, actually, I
kind of wanted the reader

30:36.054 --> 30:37.843
- to decide for himself. 
- Oh, ambiguity.

30:37.844 --> 30:39.727
Would you guys excuse me? I'm so sorry.

30:39.728 --> 30:43.400
I see an old roommate of
mine who owes me $800.

30:47.416 --> 30:50.308
- Kitty, what the hell is going on here?
- Nothing, nothing.

30:50.309 --> 30:53.025
I'm just, uh, doing the robot.

30:54.617 --> 30:56.266
Y-you know, you're... you're... you're...

30:56.267 --> 30:59.317
Putting me in a... in a... in a
terrible position, you know?

30:59.874 --> 31:01.355
Oh. Uh-oh.

31:01.356 --> 31:02.251
What?

31:02.624 --> 31:04.511
What? What?

31:05.493 --> 31:06.430
Oh.

31:06.766 --> 31:07.992
Oh, this is worse than I thought.

31:07.993 --> 31:11.035
- She is a bit nervy. - What?
No, no, no. Not... not Berklee.

31:11.036 --> 31:14.393
- I know exactly who Berklee is.
You. - Oh, no. Se... oh.

31:14.394 --> 31:17.723
You... What is this?
It's... it's Sarah's fiancè. W...

31:17.724 --> 31:19.832
This is like some sting operation.

31:19.923 --> 31:20.434
- Come on. It's not... 
- What kind

31:20.435 --> 31:21.812
of game are you and Sarah
playing here, huh?

31:21.813 --> 31:26.402
- Would you sit down. I'll explain. - You 
know,  I'm finally getting back to my life...

31:26.403 --> 31:27.586
I'm sorry. Okay, okay, uh,

31:27.587 --> 31:29.645
listen, please don't be mad with Kitty.

31:29.646 --> 31:31.891
B-be mad at me, because
this is all my fault.

31:31.892 --> 31:34.615
- This whole night was my idea. 
- It's true.

31:34.833 --> 31:36.758
Okay. Yeah, fine.
I'll get mad at both of you.

31:36.759 --> 31:38.584
What were you thinking?

31:38.630 --> 31:40.489
Seth, I saw you with my sister,

31:40.490 --> 31:42.274
and I know how happy you made her.

31:42.329 --> 31:44.431
- And don't say that you
weren't happy, too... - Okay,

31:44.432 --> 31:46.426
so this is like couples'
therapy now or something?

31:46.471 --> 31:48.522
Yes, yes, it is, because you two need it.

31:48.805 --> 31:51.465
Please don't let tonight ruin your future,

31:51.466 --> 31:53.592
because Kitty knows that
she made a mistake,

31:53.640 --> 31:56.318
and she's sorry and she wants you back.

31:57.427 --> 31:59.067
Mm.

31:59.068 --> 32:00.489
So is that... is that how you feel

32:00.490 --> 32:02.359
or is that how Sarah feels?

32:02.552 --> 32:05.335
Um... I...

32:06.594 --> 32:07.864
You know, I'm sorry.

32:07.865 --> 32:10.334
- Just don't. Just... that's all right.
- No, no. I'm sorry. I...

32:11.325 --> 32:14.188
Uh, Seth. Wait. I...

32:39.038 --> 32:40.312
Grandma Nora,

32:40.892 --> 32:42.739
I need you to give me a ride.

32:42.740 --> 32:43.636
Where to?

32:43.637 --> 32:45.074
To the group home.

32:46.161 --> 32:48.233
Oh, Olivia. No.

32:48.234 --> 32:50.690
I hate that everyone's fighting over me.

32:52.732 --> 32:54.009
Did you hear that?

32:54.345 --> 32:55.600
What?

32:58.657 --> 32:59.846
Lily!

33:00.302 --> 33:02.992
Lily! Hi!

33:02.993 --> 33:04.953
Oh, Lily.

33:04.954 --> 33:08.153
Oh, my goodness. I missed you so much.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.711
I was so worried, you big, stupid,

33:10.712 --> 33:12.865
inconsiderate piece of poop.

33:12.866 --> 33:15.089
Oh, goodness.

33:16.371 --> 33:18.466
- Who's that? 
- I don't know.

33:19.339 --> 33:21.395
So we don't know who she is?

33:21.657 --> 33:22.946
No.

33:23.519 --> 33:24.580
No... no collar,

33:24.581 --> 33:27.827
no tags, but hungry and stinks.

33:27.828 --> 33:31.128
After you finish eating, we're
gonna do a nice long soak.

33:31.731 --> 33:34.096
And what are we gonna do
with her after the bath?

33:34.216 --> 33:35.188
Well, I don't know.

33:35.189 --> 33:38.979
I'll, um, I'll take down
the dog lost fliers

33:38.980 --> 33:41.813
and put up dog found fliers.

33:42.582 --> 33:44.488
What if nobody calls?

33:45.698 --> 33:47.217
Well, then I hope she's happy

33:47.218 --> 33:48.509
living in a place with a pool

33:48.556 --> 33:50.845
and some very tasty azaleas.

33:56.209 --> 33:57.898
I need a ride.

33:58.060 --> 33:58.944
Honestly, honey,

33:58.945 --> 34:01.116
you don't have to go
back to the group home.

34:02.256 --> 34:03.903
Not to the home.

34:07.782 --> 34:08.710
Excuse me.

34:08.710 --> 34:11.554
Kevin. Justin just told us.

34:11.556 --> 34:12.600
Why didn't you say anything?

34:12.601 --> 34:14.014
Because I didn't want
to put you through it,

34:14.014 --> 34:16.251
- and they're making the decision now.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

34:16.252 --> 34:17.208
- I can't believe this. 
- Well,

34:17.259 --> 34:18.664
what... How long have you been out here?

34:18.665 --> 34:22.040
- Five or six hours. I don't know.
- Kevin, they're ready.

34:22.389 --> 34:23.670
- Oh, no. 
- We'll... we'll come in with you.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.694
No, no, you can't.
It's parties involved only.

34:25.695 --> 34:27.635
- Can you... - All right.
Well, go, go, go, go. Good luck.

34:27.636 --> 34:28.569
Thank you.

34:32.216 --> 34:33.917
I've heard compelling arguments

34:33.918 --> 34:37.297
on both sides of this
very complicated matter.

34:37.649 --> 34:39.955
In reaching my decision,
I've had to weigh the...

34:42.784 --> 34:43.556
Olivia?

34:43.558 --> 34:45.080
- Liv? 
- Your Honor, this is

34:45.081 --> 34:47.295
the minor in the case and
the defendant's mother.

34:47.474 --> 34:49.300
She insisted on seeing you right away.

34:49.455 --> 34:50.897
That's all right. They can come in.

34:50.898 --> 34:52.382
Thank you, Your Honor.

34:52.384 --> 34:54.529
Um, I'm Nora Walker, and this is Olivia,

34:54.530 --> 34:57.487
and she has something she wants
to say if that's all right.

34:57.488 --> 35:00.751
Your Honor, if we're going
to hear a rehearsed speech

35:00.752 --> 35:03.947
- coached by a member of  Mr. Walker's 
family... - Nobody coached me.

35:03.948 --> 35:06.637
We'd like very much to hear
what you have to tell us.

35:07.233 --> 35:10.020
May I ask you to address
your remarks to the court?

35:14.670 --> 35:17.132
I was happy when Brian came back,

35:17.701 --> 35:20.536
but I wasn't happy when he
said that I couldn't see

35:20.537 --> 35:24.484
Kevin and Scotty and everybody
if I went to live with him.

35:24.970 --> 35:27.259
I wish he could get it 
about the Walkers...

35:27.260 --> 35:29.532
They let everybody into their kitchen,

35:29.577 --> 35:32.633
even scruffy old dogs they've
never even seen before.

35:33.133 --> 35:35.152
And if he let me be one of them,

35:35.332 --> 35:37.315
then he could be one of them, too.

35:37.950 --> 35:42.429
It's like, if Nora's my
grandma, and he's my brother,

35:42.430 --> 35:44.508
then Nora's his grandma, too.

35:46.929 --> 35:48.196
And...

35:48.616 --> 35:50.586
I just hope he thinks about it.

35:54.827 --> 35:56.709
Thank you very much, Olivia.

35:59.281 --> 36:00.780
I am grateful we were able to hear

36:00.781 --> 36:04.164
from this very articulate young lady.

36:04.890 --> 36:06.824
This has been a difficult matter,

36:06.825 --> 36:09.770
and it is my great hope
that the two parties

36:09.771 --> 36:12.140
will someday find common ground.

36:16.339 --> 36:18.085
I'm deciding against the petition

36:18.086 --> 36:20.703
and confirming the existing
custody arrangement.

36:26.746 --> 36:27.932
Brian...

36:43.805 --> 36:44.678
Brian.

36:44.757 --> 36:46.562
Do you always storm off like this

36:46.563 --> 36:48.379
when things don't go your way?

36:48.700 --> 36:51.045
You guys all got to her.
I didn't have a chance.

36:51.046 --> 36:52.739
No one got to her.

36:52.740 --> 36:55.289
That was Olivia speaking from her heart.

36:55.290 --> 36:58.034
Didn't you see her face,
how hard it was on her?

36:58.579 --> 37:00.482
Look, as I see it, 
you've got two choices.

37:00.483 --> 37:02.397
You can either storm off into the sunset

37:02.398 --> 37:05.273
or you can be the big
brother she thinks you are

37:05.274 --> 37:06.772
and come through for her.

37:09.378 --> 37:11.151
Think about it.

37:12.515 --> 37:14.788
But don't think too long.

37:15.061 --> 37:17.763
When you're 9 years old, 
a day is forever.

37:41.045 --> 37:42.333
Who is it?

37:42.621 --> 37:44.314
Uh, it's uh, it's me.

37:49.606 --> 37:50.724
Uh...

37:51.744 --> 37:52.794
Hi.

37:54.402 --> 37:55.542
Um...

37:58.936 --> 38:00.151
- Hi. 
- Hi.

38:00.152 --> 38:02.929
Um, okay, I just, um, need to
say a couple things to you.

38:02.930 --> 38:04.288
Listen, no, 
I r... I really have to say...

38:04.289 --> 38:06.516
- No, no, no. Let me go first, okay? 
- Okay.

38:06.679 --> 38:09.932
Okay. You have to know
four things, all right?

38:09.933 --> 38:13.785
One, you're beautiful when
you're humiliating yourself.

38:13.786 --> 38:15.890
- Oh, God. I am really... 
- Two, uh, two...

38:15.891 --> 38:19.825
Oh. Berklee and I met three very
nice South African kite surfers

38:19.826 --> 38:20.901
at the valet stand,

38:20.902 --> 38:22.249
and that's the last I saw of her,

38:22.250 --> 38:25.099
three... I adore you,

38:25.100 --> 38:26.531
and... and I want to give you

38:26.532 --> 38:28.672
- another chance... 
- Why do I feel like the fourth one

38:28.673 --> 38:30.938
is gonna begin with a "but"?

38:31.304 --> 38:32.669
Because it does.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.383
I...

38:35.566 --> 38:40.369
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry that I ran away.

38:40.370 --> 38:42.581
I... you know, I don't know...

38:43.196 --> 38:45.399
I don't know what's gonna
happen with my health,

38:45.400 --> 38:49.828
but... I d-do believe
that we can handle it.

38:49.829 --> 38:54.195
And, um... I promise that
I will try and reach out

38:54.804 --> 38:56.355
when I need help,

38:56.564 --> 38:58.448
because, of course,
that's what two people do

38:58.449 --> 39:01.067
when they care about each other.

39:01.218 --> 39:02.470
And, um...

39:04.069 --> 39:06.281
I don't want to do this alone.

39:10.758 --> 39:13.182
Now... why didn't you just...

39:13.424 --> 39:15.561
Why didn't you just say
that in the first place?

39:15.707 --> 39:18.177
Because I'm an idiot, and, um...

39:19.367 --> 39:21.495
Because I didn't want to get hurt.

39:24.976 --> 39:26.709
And what about my age?

39:26.834 --> 39:28.522
Are we... are we done 
talking about my age?

39:28.523 --> 39:29.854
- No, no. 
- No?

39:29.855 --> 39:32.687
But I do think that you
are the wise old man

39:32.688 --> 39:35.153
and I'm the teenager.

39:37.613 --> 39:39.064
I like that.

39:49.596 --> 39:50.242
Do you realize

39:50.243 --> 39:52.376
how many bullets we've dodged lately...

39:52.918 --> 39:54.835
Kitty's health, Olivia...

39:55.544 --> 39:57.942
A dog that came back from the dead?

39:58.208 --> 40:00.012
Does all that good luck scare you?

40:00.192 --> 40:01.188
No.

40:01.651 --> 40:03.321
No, I guess it just reminds me

40:03.322 --> 40:06.375
of how utterly dependent on luck we are.

40:06.984 --> 40:08.602
It's bound to run out soon.

40:09.370 --> 40:10.728
What if it doesn't?

40:11.550 --> 40:12.973
What do you mean?

40:13.507 --> 40:15.190
The gallery called.

40:17.322 --> 40:18.790
They are finally

40:18.791 --> 40:20.614
giving me my own show.

40:20.914 --> 40:24.710
- Oh, Luc. That's fantastic.
- I know it's fantastic,

40:25.044 --> 40:27.560
but I'm gonna be painting 
ten hours a day.

40:27.561 --> 40:29.347
We need to plan our wedding.

40:29.810 --> 40:31.812
- We are planning our wedding. 
- Are we?

40:31.813 --> 40:34.065
Because every time I talk about
meeting with a wedding planner,

40:34.066 --> 40:37.385
- you keep putting it off. 
- You're right.

40:38.432 --> 40:40.321
All right. I'll set up a meeting.

40:40.322 --> 40:41.748
And don't put it off again,

40:41.749 --> 40:44.460
- because you make me feel you
want to avoid it. Hmm? - What?

40:44.598 --> 40:45.333
Yeah.

40:45.334 --> 40:47.775
No. No, no, Luc.

40:47.776 --> 40:49.702
I'm just... you know, you're right,

40:49.703 --> 40:52.589
I-I've been busy and distracted.

40:52.590 --> 40:54.433
I'll focus. I promise.

41:01.239 --> 41:03.164
He's not coming, is he?

41:03.205 --> 41:04.918
He might. It's not so late.

41:04.919 --> 41:07.983
Even if he doesn't come tonight,
he'll come around someday.

41:09.831 --> 41:11.416
What if he still doesn't?

41:11.417 --> 41:12.997
We'll call him and we'll
invite him over again.

41:12.998 --> 41:14.909
We'll just keep trying. I promise.

41:14.910 --> 41:17.146
He's... he's your brother, 
no matter what.

41:17.147 --> 41:19.382
Right now he's angry and he's upset.

41:19.383 --> 41:20.960
But I know that he loves you.

41:20.961 --> 41:25.503
We're so proud of you, O.
You were amazingly brave today.

41:30.011 --> 41:31.747
I'm not that hungry.

41:31.748 --> 41:33.534
I think I'm gonna go to bed.

41:33.535 --> 41:35.947
Okay. Look, why don't we all
go up and read a story?

41:35.948 --> 41:37.757
Yeah, we'll finish "Phantom Tollbooth."

41:37.758 --> 41:39.433
Ooh.

41:49.232 --> 41:50.391
Olivia.

41:51.631 --> 41:52.960
Brian.

41:58.105 --> 42:00.476
I hope it's okay that I came by.

42:00.718 --> 42:02.612
- Of course. 
- Of course it's okay.

42:05.934 --> 42:07.627
Are you hungry?

42:08.377 --> 42:09.889
Actually, yeah.

42:09.890 --> 42:10.891
I am.

42:20.700 --> 42:22.695
Scotty is the best cook ever.
