00:00.403 --> 00:01.971
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:02.037 --> 00:03.072
How does she seem?

00:03.123 --> 00:04.123
Like Olivia Dunham.

00:04.207 --> 00:05.658
She's internalized her traits.

00:05.742 --> 00:08.577
For all intents and purposes,
she is our agent Dunham.

00:08.628 --> 00:10.729
You're imbedding
one of them on my team?

00:10.797 --> 00:12.081
What if her new identity
doesn't hold?

00:12.148 --> 00:14.717
Then she'll no longer
be necessary.

00:14.784 --> 00:17.036
So you know things
about the other side.

00:17.103 --> 00:18.888
Things you couldn't know
unless you were from there.

00:18.955 --> 00:19.922
Like what?

00:19.990 --> 00:21.624
Your niece is alive.

00:21.691 --> 00:23.542
She was born, and it's
her birthday today.

00:23.610 --> 00:24.927
There's no way to prove it.

00:24.978 --> 00:26.512
Yes, there is.

00:26.596 --> 00:29.298
Their Olivia can
travel between worlds safely.

00:29.349 --> 00:31.684
We believe you may be
able to the same.

00:36.990 --> 00:38.240
Aunt Liv!

00:38.308 --> 00:40.542
I knew you wouldn't
forget my birthday.

00:40.610 --> 00:42.411
Ahh! It didn't work.

00:42.478 --> 00:44.597
All I saw was black.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

Through suffering
comes redemption.

01:49.212 --> 01:52.648
Through sorrow
comes exaltation.

01:57.854 --> 02:01.824
Through pitch dark
comes a cleansing fire.

02:03.393 --> 02:07.997
Through the fire, we shall find
a spring of new life.

02:40.163 --> 02:43.065
Mommy?

02:43.133 --> 02:44.600
Max?

02:44.667 --> 02:47.720
There's a monster in my closet.

02:56.379 --> 02:57.946
No monsters here.

03:02.952 --> 03:04.837
None there either.

03:04.921 --> 03:06.004
Looks like your room

03:06.089 --> 03:08.357
is officially monster-free
tonight, kiddo.

03:08.425 --> 03:10.225
Now, you remember
what big boys do

03:10.293 --> 03:11.960
to get rid of monsters
in their room?

03:12.011 --> 03:13.628
Well, you close your eyes,

03:13.680 --> 03:15.330
and you count to three.

03:15.398 --> 03:16.932
And when we open them?

03:16.983 --> 03:18.384
The monster's gone.

03:19.819 --> 03:22.154
You get some rest, sweetie.

03:28.344 --> 03:30.496
I love you.

03:50.016 --> 03:53.769
One, two, three.

04:28.855 --> 04:31.173
<i>Polls show that most Americans</i>

04:31.224 --> 04:34.860
<i>oppose the proposed law to
limit the number of children</i>

04:34.945 --> 04:36.228
<i>to two per family...</i>

04:37.680 --> 04:39.064
<i>However, leading politicians</i>

04:39.149 --> 04:41.516
<i>from two of the three
major parties favor the law...</i>

04:41.568 --> 04:43.686
<i>Hey.</i>

04:43.753 --> 04:44.853
<i>You.</i>

04:44.904 --> 04:46.822
<i>W- what are you doing here?</i>

04:46.873 --> 04:49.575
Can I buy you breakfast?

04:53.613 --> 04:55.247
Thank you.

04:55.332 --> 04:57.532
Thanks.

05:00.370 --> 05:03.105
I need to get into the D.O.D.
facility on Liberty Island,

05:03.173 --> 05:05.307
and I need your help.

05:05.375 --> 05:08.477
I can steal a boat, but I can't
leave it docked on the island,

05:08.544 --> 05:10.279
otherwise the security
patrol would find it,

05:10.347 --> 05:12.848
and I need some time
inside the building alone.

05:12.899 --> 05:15.200
I just need you to get me
across the water.

05:15.268 --> 05:17.436
Across the patrolled water.

05:17.520 --> 05:18.904
You're with Fringe division.

05:18.989 --> 05:21.991
Don't you have super-secret
clearance or something?

05:22.058 --> 05:23.575
Why you breaking
into a government building?

05:23.660 --> 05:25.060
Because I have to go home.

05:25.111 --> 05:28.113
Oh, so home is
on Liberty Island now.

05:34.637 --> 05:37.072
It doesn't matter
where I'm from.

05:37.123 --> 05:38.424
What matters...

05:38.508 --> 05:40.426
what matters is that
I'm in trouble,

05:40.510 --> 05:42.294
and I think that my time
is running out here,

05:42.379 --> 05:44.046
and right now
you are the only person

05:44.097 --> 05:46.115
that I'm willing to trust.

05:46.182 --> 05:49.218
I need your help, Henry.

05:49.269 --> 05:52.104
Please, will you help me?

05:56.042 --> 05:58.861
So if all you're asking for
is a ride...

06:00.914 --> 06:02.815
You ain't got to steal a boat.

06:02.899 --> 06:05.434
My cousin has one.
Just give me a day or so.

06:05.485 --> 06:08.821
Thank you.
Yeah.

06:16.212 --> 06:17.663
Okay, there's my number.

06:17.747 --> 06:20.115
I gotta go.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.133
Hey.

06:21.217 --> 06:22.668
Those people
you're running away from,

06:22.752 --> 06:24.119
they still after you?

06:24.170 --> 06:27.806
Not if they keep believing
that I'm somebody else, no.

06:27.891 --> 06:30.442
Thanks.

06:35.432 --> 06:37.433
<i>We'll let you
know if Fringe division</i>

06:37.484 --> 06:39.401
<i>officially assumes the case.</i>

06:39.469 --> 06:42.154
Thanks.
Appreciate it.

06:42.238 --> 06:43.655
So what do we have?

06:43.740 --> 06:46.358
Kid was abducted
from his bedroom last night.

06:46.443 --> 06:48.810
Okay, we're good down here.

06:48.862 --> 06:50.529
Molecular cohesion intact.

06:50.613 --> 06:53.198
Atmosphere readings are solid.

06:53.283 --> 06:55.167
Now, these kidnappings
are tragic,

06:55.251 --> 06:57.870
but 99% of them have nothing
to do with Fringe division.

06:57.954 --> 06:59.922
Yeah, tell that
to the secretary.

06:59.989 --> 07:02.124
Peter Bishop act of '91
says every kidnapping

07:02.175 --> 07:03.792
gets treated like
a possible fringe event.

07:03.843 --> 07:05.110
All I'm saying
is that these cops

07:05.178 --> 07:06.995
don't need us
to work their cases, okay?

07:07.063 --> 07:07.996
<i>Waste of manpower.</i>

07:11.401 --> 07:13.869
It's not a waste.

07:16.022 --> 07:17.189
I'll get a statement.

07:17.273 --> 07:20.359
Let's check upstairs.

07:26.449 --> 07:28.150
Detective?

07:28.201 --> 07:30.202
Would you mind walking us
through the scene?

07:30.286 --> 07:32.788
Sure. Uh, victim
is Max Clayton,

07:32.855 --> 07:34.156
eight years old.

07:34.207 --> 07:36.592
Mom came to check on him
in the morning,

07:36.659 --> 07:38.093
<i>and he was gone.</i>

07:38.161 --> 07:40.412
We, uh... we found a couple
of partial prints

07:40.497 --> 07:41.997
on the windowsill
and in the closet,

07:42.048 --> 07:45.167
but we're still
collecting evidence.

07:45.218 --> 07:46.718
We believe the suspect
snatched the kid,

07:46.803 --> 07:48.387
and he, uh,
fled out the window.

07:48.471 --> 07:49.671
Well, it's a long way down,

07:49.722 --> 07:51.824
especially if you're carrying
a 50-pound kid.

07:51.891 --> 07:55.828
<i>Okay, so the suspect
is probably male, strong,</i>

07:55.895 --> 07:58.013
uh, say 20 to 35.

07:58.064 --> 08:01.934
Hey, can I see that
for a second?

08:02.018 --> 08:05.220
There's some kind of residue
on these fingerprints.

08:12.979 --> 08:15.197
Sucrose.

08:15.248 --> 08:17.249
Sugar? What, was he eating
cookies or something?

08:17.333 --> 08:21.119
Uh-uh. He secretes it
through his sweat.

08:21.204 --> 08:23.238
It's the candy man.

08:23.289 --> 08:24.673
He's back.

08:38.125 --> 08:39.308
Mr. Secretary.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.894
I just heard.

08:43.847 --> 08:45.798
Fringe division was created

08:45.849 --> 08:49.669
to investigate tragedies
of unimaginable scale.

08:49.737 --> 08:52.855
You and I both know that
there's no crime more heinous

08:52.923 --> 08:54.023
than the theft of a child.

08:54.108 --> 08:56.542
I'll do everything I can
to find him, sir.

08:56.610 --> 08:59.812
I don't doubt
your resolve, Phillip.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.366
Actually, that's why I'm here.

09:03.434 --> 09:06.219
There's no shame in letting
it fall to another desk

09:06.287 --> 09:08.805
if it's too personal.

09:18.382 --> 09:22.485
It's been four years since
the candy man took my son.

09:22.553 --> 09:24.070
<i>Four years...</i>

09:24.138 --> 09:26.973
Since I heard him laugh

09:27.024 --> 09:31.744
or watched him play
outside with his sister.

09:31.812 --> 09:36.015
He had my son for two days.

09:36.066 --> 09:39.385
When I got him back,
he wasn't a little boy anymore.

09:44.708 --> 09:49.028
If there's anyone
you want on this case...

09:49.096 --> 09:51.664
It's me.

09:51.732 --> 09:54.367
Very well.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.870
My only concern
is that I don't have

09:57.921 --> 09:59.555
all of my agents to help me.

09:59.623 --> 10:02.475
How long until
this is over, sir,

10:02.543 --> 10:04.444
until our Olivia comes home?

10:04.511 --> 10:07.897
You'll be happy to know
we made a breakthrough.

10:07.981 --> 10:10.333
We found something
in her brain chemistry,

10:10.401 --> 10:14.120
<i>something unique.</i>

10:14.188 --> 10:16.906
If it's what enables her
to cross between worlds,

10:16.990 --> 10:19.892
you'll have your team
back very soon.

10:22.696 --> 10:25.948
I know what it's like
to lose a son.

10:26.016 --> 10:30.169
And even when they come back,
the damage is irreparable.

10:30.237 --> 10:33.873
If you need someone to talk to,
Phillip, let me know.

10:41.265 --> 10:43.299
We need a lead, folks.

10:43.384 --> 10:45.318
Something to go on.

10:45.386 --> 10:48.805
It's been 18 hours since
the Clayton boy went missing.

10:48.889 --> 10:49.956
That gives us

10:50.023 --> 10:52.275
<i>until tomorrow night
to find him.</i>

10:52.359 --> 10:54.877
The candy man's last
kidnapping was two years ago,

10:54.945 --> 10:57.280
<i>before you joined
Fringe division.</i>

10:57.364 --> 10:59.649
I remember when this happened,
reading about it,

10:59.733 --> 11:02.068
but they never said
what he did to these kids.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.070
<i>It's like they've had
the life drained out of them.</i>

11:04.138 --> 11:06.489
Acute deterioration
of organ tissue,

11:06.573 --> 11:08.458
depleted immune systems.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.626
Some of the kids even
came back with cancer.

11:16.116 --> 11:19.068
Those incisions...
why there?

11:19.136 --> 11:21.170
<i>Posterior
cerebral cortex.</i>

11:21.255 --> 11:24.056
From that point on the body,
you can access the spine.

11:24.124 --> 11:27.059
Okay, Astrid, what do we know
about these cases?

11:27.127 --> 11:29.262
The abductions themselves
appear to be random,

11:29.313 --> 11:30.796
occurring every two years.

11:30.848 --> 11:32.131
The victims are always children

11:32.199 --> 11:33.399
ages seven through nine.

11:33.467 --> 11:35.401
They are taken,
then released 48 hours later

11:35.469 --> 11:36.969
with massive
internal degradation.

11:37.020 --> 11:38.938
<i>The victims
describe the suspect</i>

11:38.989 --> 11:40.323
as male, age unknown.

11:40.407 --> 11:42.325
In the majority of cases,
other than a shaved head,

11:42.409 --> 11:43.860
there's no physical
description given,

11:43.944 --> 11:44.994
because he wore a mask.

11:45.078 --> 11:46.812
What do you mean
"in the majority of cases"?

11:46.864 --> 11:48.948
Two of the victims
reported being held captive

11:48.999 --> 11:51.701
by two suspects,
one young and one old.

11:51.785 --> 11:53.770
Then why haven't we expanded
the profile

11:53.837 --> 11:55.505
<i>to look for two suspects?</i>

11:55.589 --> 11:57.089
Liv, these kids
were really scared.

11:57.157 --> 11:59.375
There's a lot of inconsistencies
in their statements.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.427
Well, that doesn't mean
that they're not true.

12:01.495 --> 12:03.880
Can you please pull up
the victim's BIOS?

12:03.964 --> 12:08.184
Okay, Amanda holt
and Christopher...

12:08.268 --> 12:09.685
<i>Broyles.</i>

12:16.443 --> 12:18.194
We should speak
to Christopher again.

12:18.278 --> 12:20.029
That's not a good idea, liv.

12:20.113 --> 12:21.481
You weren't here
when it happened.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.149
Broyles is protective.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.534
Well, we should at least ask.

12:24.618 --> 12:25.684
<i>Liv...</i>

12:25.736 --> 12:27.703
Don't even think about it.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.665
I would like
to reinterview your son.

12:39.733 --> 12:42.902
Excuse me?

12:42.970 --> 12:45.171
Christopher reported
that he was held by two men...

12:45.222 --> 12:46.923
an older man and a younger man.

12:47.007 --> 12:48.257
Now, if that's true,

12:48.342 --> 12:49.976
he may remember other things
about this guy

12:50.043 --> 12:52.011
that could help
our investigation.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.767
Agent Dunham...

13:00.053 --> 13:01.621
My son went through something

13:01.688 --> 13:04.407
no child should ever
have to go through.

13:04.491 --> 13:07.026
And when he came home,

13:07.094 --> 13:09.879
I had to ask him
questions about it,

13:09.947 --> 13:13.249
going over the details
again and again,

13:13.333 --> 13:14.784
forcing him to relive it,

13:14.868 --> 13:17.620
when all he wanted
to do was forget.

13:17.704 --> 13:20.189
And for what?

13:20.257 --> 13:23.242
I didn't solve the case.

13:23.310 --> 13:26.712
And I didn't help
my little boy sleep at night.

13:28.782 --> 13:30.583
I'm sure
that you did your best,

13:30.651 --> 13:32.785
but if I spoke to him,

13:32.853 --> 13:35.104
maybe I could get more
out of him.

13:38.392 --> 13:40.943
I'm his father.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.379
Perhaps that's the problem.

13:43.447 --> 13:46.032
Maybe there are some things
that you don't want to hear.

13:49.152 --> 13:52.305
Now, there's something
I want you to hear.

13:52.372 --> 13:54.523
My son's condition
since he was taken

13:54.591 --> 13:56.158
has deteriorated so rapidly

13:56.243 --> 13:59.912
that he'll be lucky if he
makes it to his 18th birthday.

13:59.963 --> 14:02.248
Now, what little childhood
Christopher has left,

14:02.299 --> 14:04.717
I intend to protect it.

14:04.784 --> 14:06.152
I get that.

14:06.219 --> 14:07.637
But Christopher's childhood

14:07.721 --> 14:10.840
is not the only one
at stake right now.

14:12.726 --> 14:15.461
You're dismissed.

14:40.671 --> 14:42.488
I don't feel good.

14:42.539 --> 14:44.006
I want to go home.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.908
Through suffering
comes redemption.

14:45.976 --> 14:48.661
Through sorrow
comes exaltation.

14:48.712 --> 14:51.180
Through the pitch dark
comes the cleansing fire,

14:51.264 --> 14:55.217
and through the fire, we shall
find the spring of new life.

15:02.471 --> 15:03.738
<i>...Devotes his life</i>

15:03.806 --> 15:06.374
<i>to righting wrongs,
protecting the innocent,</i>

15:06.442 --> 15:08.126
<i>and punishing the guilty.</i>

15:08.193 --> 15:11.762
<i>Cranston is known to
the underworld as the shadow.</i>

15:11.814 --> 15:13.865
<i>Never seen, only heard,</i>

15:13.932 --> 15:15.633
<i>his true identity
is known only</i>

15:15.701 --> 15:19.454
<i>to his constant
friend and aide Margo Lane.</i>

15:19.538 --> 15:21.439
<i>Today's story...</i>

15:21.490 --> 15:24.075
Hey.

15:28.047 --> 15:31.983
There's been a police officer
parked out front all afternoon.

15:32.051 --> 15:36.087
So it's true?

15:36.138 --> 15:38.373
The candy man's back?

15:38.440 --> 15:39.874
Yeah.

15:44.096 --> 15:46.431
Do you think he'll try
to come back here?

15:46.482 --> 15:49.484
No.

15:49.568 --> 15:51.469
It's just for my peace of mind.

15:54.973 --> 15:56.658
How's Christopher?

15:56.742 --> 15:58.993
He's scared.

15:59.078 --> 16:00.645
The story
about the missing boy's

16:00.696 --> 16:02.580
been all over the news today.

16:06.085 --> 16:08.286
Did you eat?

16:08.337 --> 16:10.872
Not since breakfast.

16:13.709 --> 16:16.094
Has there been any progress
in the case?

16:16.161 --> 16:18.196
No.

16:18.263 --> 16:19.981
One of my agents
wanted to reinterview Chris...

16:20.049 --> 16:21.516
<i>Olivia Dunham.</i>

16:21.600 --> 16:23.685
<i>She thinks there may be
some detail he's forgotten.</i>

16:23.769 --> 16:26.187
<i>I told her it was
a waste of time.</i>

16:29.692 --> 16:32.593
I've always liked Olivia.

16:32.661 --> 16:36.197
She seems very smart.

16:44.856 --> 16:47.875
I'm gonna go put him to bed.

16:47.960 --> 16:52.146
He's a strong boy, Phillip...

16:52.214 --> 16:55.383
Strong enough to talk
about it...

16:55.467 --> 16:57.385
Even if you're not.

17:06.895 --> 17:10.765
Thought you
might be hungry too.

17:10.848 --> 17:12.233
Red vines?

17:12.317 --> 17:14.602
They're new.
Charlie tried them.

17:14.686 --> 17:16.404
He said they're great.

17:18.773 --> 17:20.891
Thanks.

17:23.996 --> 17:26.781
So after the victims
were abducted,

17:26.865 --> 17:29.200
the kids came back
with massive cell degeneration

17:29.251 --> 17:31.502
and internal-organ atrophy.

17:31.570 --> 17:32.903
All those conditions

17:32.955 --> 17:34.739
are symptomatic
of old age too, right?

17:34.790 --> 17:36.441
I suppose so.
Why?

17:36.508 --> 17:39.093
Well, aging has to do
with the pituitary gland, right?

17:39.178 --> 17:41.846
Which can be accessed
through the back of the neck.

17:41.913 --> 17:43.914
Did you suddenly become
a scientist

17:43.966 --> 17:45.466
when I was in the hospital?

17:45.534 --> 17:47.101
You trying to take my job?

17:47.186 --> 17:48.302
It was an old case
that I worked

17:48.387 --> 17:49.721
before I joined
Fringe division.

17:49.772 --> 17:51.856
This guy was draining hormones

17:51.923 --> 17:53.224
from pituitary glands.

17:53.275 --> 17:56.310
Anyway, my point is that
some of the victims

17:56.395 --> 17:58.780
mentioned there were
two suspects,

17:58.864 --> 18:00.598
one old and one young,

18:00.649 --> 18:02.233
but they all said
that they never saw

18:02.284 --> 18:03.751
the suspects at the same time.

18:03.819 --> 18:05.420
Okay.

18:05.487 --> 18:07.305
Well, what if
there weren't two people?

18:07.372 --> 18:09.123
What if there
was only one person

18:09.208 --> 18:13.978
who was literally changing
from old to young?

18:14.046 --> 18:17.231
What if the candy man
is stealing youth?

18:20.786 --> 18:23.087
Okay.

18:23.138 --> 18:27.008
In theory, concentrated
pituitary hormones

18:27.092 --> 18:29.343
could be processed in some way

18:29.428 --> 18:30.762
to accelerate healing,

18:30.813 --> 18:33.631
maybe even reverse aging,

18:33.699 --> 18:34.849
but if that's true,

18:34.933 --> 18:36.768
it would also cause
some serious side effects.

18:36.819 --> 18:39.320
Like what?
Anemia, tremors, hypoglycemia.

18:39.404 --> 18:41.072
High blood sugar?

18:41.139 --> 18:44.475
High enough that he could
secrete sugar in his sweat?

18:48.280 --> 18:50.281
This is Dunham.

18:53.218 --> 18:55.319
Okay, I'll be there.

18:55.370 --> 18:57.488
Thank you.

18:57.556 --> 19:01.158
What was that about?

19:01.210 --> 19:03.361
It's nice
to see you again, Olivia.

19:03.428 --> 19:06.464
Chris is looking forward
to meeting you.

19:09.768 --> 19:11.969
Here we are.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.939
Chris, agent Dunham's here.

19:15.006 --> 19:17.391
Oh, uh, actually,
"Olivia" is fine.

19:17.476 --> 19:19.677
It's, uh... it's nice
to meet you, Chris.

19:19.728 --> 19:25.950
Hi.

19:26.017 --> 19:28.219
Did you really save
that school bus of kids

19:28.287 --> 19:30.955
from a class-three vortex
last year?

19:31.022 --> 19:33.291
Is it true?

19:33.358 --> 19:36.244
Well, I was just doing my job.

19:36.328 --> 19:39.163
That's so cool.

19:42.217 --> 19:43.751
So...

19:43.836 --> 19:48.055
My mom says you want to talk
about the man who took me.

19:48.140 --> 19:50.925
Yeah.
Would that be okay?

19:54.847 --> 19:56.046
Sure.

19:59.585 --> 20:01.536
<i>Maybe we could
talk somewhere else.</i>

20:01.603 --> 20:05.055
Like, where is your
favorite place to go?

20:18.503 --> 20:20.872
Broyles.

20:20.923 --> 20:23.040
<i>The candy man has
had the boy for 36 hours.</i>

20:23.091 --> 20:24.074
12 hours left.

20:24.126 --> 20:26.210
<i>How are we doing?
Nothing yet,</i>

20:26.261 --> 20:27.962
but we're working
every lead we have.

20:28.030 --> 20:29.430
<i>You'll be happy to hear</i>

20:29.514 --> 20:30.915
<i>that you'll have your team
back together soon.</i>

20:30.983 --> 20:32.583
Our Olivia's mission
on the other side

20:32.634 --> 20:33.784
is almost complete.

20:33.852 --> 20:35.219
<i>We'll be able
to bring her home.</i>

20:35.287 --> 20:36.587
And what about this Olivia?

20:36.655 --> 20:40.174
Going to pull her out of
the field tomorrow morning.

20:40.242 --> 20:43.194
I don't believe
we'll be needing her anymore.

20:43.262 --> 20:45.029
<i>Call me
if you find anything.</i>

20:54.156 --> 20:57.107
My dad says I need to forget
about what happened.

20:57.159 --> 20:59.443
Yeah?

20:59.494 --> 21:01.913
But it's hard
to forget, isn't it?

21:04.783 --> 21:05.917
You know, I can imagine

21:05.968 --> 21:08.786
what it must have
been like for you...

21:08.837 --> 21:10.755
How scared you must have been,

21:10.806 --> 21:12.957
how much you...
you would have wanted

21:13.008 --> 21:16.444
to get back to your family
and to your friends.

21:18.030 --> 21:21.766
I- I have nightmares
about it sometimes.

21:21.817 --> 21:24.635
Really?

21:24.686 --> 21:27.688
Could you tell me about them?

21:33.779 --> 21:38.149
I always remember
the smell first.

21:38.216 --> 21:40.551
It's musty, like our attic.

21:40.619 --> 21:43.421
He comes to the room
wearing a mask

21:43.488 --> 21:46.557
to check on that thing
stuck in my neck.

21:46.625 --> 21:49.427
It feels like...

21:49.494 --> 21:52.096
It's stealing my energy.

21:52.163 --> 21:54.465
I'm so tired.

21:54.533 --> 21:57.301
I feel sick.

22:01.807 --> 22:06.394
Chris, you said
that there were two men...

22:06.478 --> 22:10.147
One old and one young, right?

22:12.017 --> 22:14.518
Did they ever talk to you?

22:18.290 --> 22:21.459
No.
Nothing I remember.

22:27.549 --> 22:31.002
Chris...

22:31.053 --> 22:33.587
What is it?
You can tell me.

22:37.259 --> 22:41.145
I know the candy man's back.

22:41.213 --> 22:44.348
<i>Yeah, he is.</i>

22:46.485 --> 22:49.570
He said if
I told anyone about him,

22:49.654 --> 22:53.157
he... he'd come back.

22:53.224 --> 22:56.911
He said this time...

22:56.995 --> 23:00.781
He'd... he'd hurt
my mom and dad.

23:00.866 --> 23:04.452
That is not going to happen.

23:04.536 --> 23:06.904
I promise.

23:12.410 --> 23:15.096
Christopher,
there is another little boy

23:15.180 --> 23:17.131
just like you.

23:17.215 --> 23:19.433
He's been taken.

23:19.518 --> 23:24.105
And he wants to go home
and see his family too.

23:24.189 --> 23:26.423
You can help him.

23:31.930 --> 23:34.949
I remember their voices.

23:36.868 --> 23:40.771
Um, they both said
the same thing.

23:40.822 --> 23:43.491
I think it was a prayer.

23:43.575 --> 23:46.410
Can you remember the words?

23:46.461 --> 23:49.346
Some of the words.

23:53.585 --> 23:56.420
"Through the pitch dark...

23:56.471 --> 23:59.790
Comes a cleansing fire. "

24:03.929 --> 24:05.780
Okay.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.402
"Through the pitch
dark comes a cleansing fire. "

24:13.469 --> 24:15.003
<i>The words "pitch" and "dark"</i>

24:15.071 --> 24:16.738
are common to several
sacramental prayers

24:16.806 --> 24:18.273
from the early 20th century.

24:18.341 --> 24:19.691
Uh, the words appear
in the liturgy

24:19.742 --> 24:21.793
of over a dozen churches
in New York City.

24:21.861 --> 24:22.944
A dozen that we know of.

24:23.012 --> 24:24.629
Every time there's
another fringe event,

24:24.697 --> 24:25.881
a new church pops up.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.332
You know, I thought
it was bad enough

24:27.383 --> 24:28.583
someone's kidnapping kids.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.570
Now we find out
he's kidnapping kids for God?

24:37.894 --> 24:39.661
Hi, honey.

24:39.729 --> 24:42.230
Mom, I collected
some shells for you.

24:42.315 --> 24:43.598
They smell like the ocean.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.400
Thank you.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.770
Oh, looks like you brought half
the beach back with you too.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.773
No, leave the sand.
I like it.

24:51.858 --> 24:54.993
I'll be right in.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.528
Broyles.

24:56.579 --> 24:57.796
He was very, very helpful.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.031
Thank you.

25:00.082 --> 25:01.500
Come on.
I want to wash the shells off.

25:01.567 --> 25:02.501
Okay.

25:02.568 --> 25:03.752
Bye, Christopher.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.003
Bye.

25:07.239 --> 25:08.373
Dunham.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.958
<i>The boat's called Sally.</i>

25:10.042 --> 25:12.294
<i>The red hook marina
in Brooklyn... "b" dock.</i>

25:12.378 --> 25:13.595
<i>Be there tonight at 10:00,</i>

25:13.679 --> 25:14.913
<i>and I'll get you
where you want to go.</i>

25:14.964 --> 25:16.214
Okay, I'll be there.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.082
<i>Dunham.</i>

25:18.134 --> 25:19.250
Charlie got a hit
on the prayer.

25:19.302 --> 25:22.253
They traced it to
the astoria church in queens.

25:25.641 --> 25:28.443
"Through the pitch dark
comes the cleansing fire. "

25:28.528 --> 25:30.095
Yeah.
"And through the fire,

25:30.163 --> 25:33.448
you shall find the spring
of new life. "

25:33.533 --> 25:35.734
It's beautiful, isn't it?

25:35.785 --> 25:38.870
What does it mean?

25:38.938 --> 25:41.173
I wasn't always
a man of the cloth.

25:41.240 --> 25:45.276
You know, I used
to be a physician.

25:45.328 --> 25:49.164
And then the avian
influenza epidemic came.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.666
My wife became ill.

25:53.503 --> 25:56.955
And despite all my training,
there was...

25:57.023 --> 26:00.192
There was nothing
I could do to save her.

26:02.127 --> 26:04.295
Without her...

26:04.347 --> 26:06.648
I was nothing.
I was lost.

26:06.716 --> 26:09.534
But then God came
and lifted me up,

26:09.602 --> 26:11.319
and... and he showed me

26:11.404 --> 26:13.855
that what people need
in these troubled times

26:13.940 --> 26:16.458
is... is something
to believe in.

26:16.526 --> 26:18.577
Faith...

26:18.644 --> 26:21.313
that's what'll heal
this wounded world.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.148
The prayer was spoken
by the suspect

26:23.216 --> 26:25.050
in a kidnapping
that we're investigating.

26:25.117 --> 26:28.319
We believe the suspect
is a member of your church.

26:28.371 --> 26:29.504
It will help our investigation

26:29.589 --> 26:31.206
if you would give us
the names and addresses

26:31.290 --> 26:32.991
of all the men
in your congregation.

26:33.042 --> 26:35.544
Giving out information
on parishioners

26:35.628 --> 26:37.429
is... is breaking
the confessional seal.

26:37.496 --> 26:39.297
<i>Reverend Marcus,
I understand.</i>

26:39.365 --> 26:42.867
I too am a man of faith.

26:42.935 --> 26:45.353
But right now
there's a child missing,

26:45.438 --> 26:47.889
and we need your help.

26:47.957 --> 26:49.824
We have a former victim

26:49.892 --> 26:53.178
who can identify
the kidnappers' voices.

26:53.246 --> 26:56.314
And you believe that
this person is reliable?

26:56.365 --> 26:57.983
He's my son.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.201
Oh, I'm sorry.

27:07.526 --> 27:09.811
I can get you the roster
from our men's group,

27:09.879 --> 27:11.346
if that'll help.

27:11.414 --> 27:13.698
Thank you.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.383
There are over 40 names
on this list.

27:15.468 --> 27:18.253
We'll have to split up.
Call Lincoln and Charlie.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.576
No, nothing yet...

27:24.644 --> 27:27.712
Although this church
is full of true believers.

27:27.763 --> 27:29.147
One guy actually told me

27:29.214 --> 27:31.483
that the reverend
cured his kidney disease.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.384
So what about Charlie
and Lincoln?

27:33.436 --> 27:34.686
<i>No luck yet.</i>

27:34.737 --> 27:36.321
<i>They've interviewed
seven men on the list,</i>

27:36.388 --> 27:37.856
<i>and none of them
fit the profile.</i>

27:37.907 --> 27:40.241
Okay, I'm here. I'll, uh...
I'll call you in a bit.

27:47.950 --> 27:49.400
Wyatt Toomy?

27:49.452 --> 27:52.304
Agent Dunham.
I'm with Fringe division.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.122
I need to ask you
a couple questions

27:54.206 --> 27:56.174
in regard to an investigation.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.509
Can I come in?

27:57.576 --> 27:59.761
Sure.

28:04.083 --> 28:07.919
Yeah.
Saw him on the news.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.587
It's real sad.

28:09.639 --> 28:11.640
You really think someone
from the church

28:11.724 --> 28:13.608
may have taken him?

28:13.693 --> 28:14.943
Possibly. Yeah.

28:15.011 --> 28:17.612
Excuse me for a moment.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.881
<i>So did you meet
reverend Marcus?</i>

28:19.949 --> 28:21.066
Yes.

28:21.117 --> 28:24.285
He is a miracle worker.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.737
Great man.

28:25.788 --> 28:28.406
Touched by God.

28:37.717 --> 28:40.585
Do you live here alone,
Mr. Toomy?

28:40.636 --> 28:42.954
Yep.

28:43.005 --> 28:44.956
Just me.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.810
Don't move!

28:51.013 --> 28:52.480
This is agent Dunham.

28:52.565 --> 28:55.633
I'm at 1068 Kent street,
apartment 5.

28:55.685 --> 28:57.185
The suspect's been sighted.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.853
I need backup now, please.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.339
Max. Hi.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.258
Uh, I'm with the FBI.

29:20.325 --> 29:21.492
Are you okay?

29:21.544 --> 29:24.012
Okay.

29:34.473 --> 29:36.691
Hey, you okay?

29:36.776 --> 29:38.393
You sure?

29:38.477 --> 29:40.161
All right.

29:49.049 --> 29:51.000
The paramedics took Max
to the hospital.

29:51.051 --> 29:53.336
His mother's gonna
meet him there.

29:53.387 --> 29:55.255
The super said that Wyatt Toomy

29:55.339 --> 29:57.640
had been living here
for almost nine years.

29:57.708 --> 30:00.677
Kept to himself, always paid
his rent a week in advance.

30:00.744 --> 30:01.661
<i>Hey.</i>

30:01.729 --> 30:03.880
You guys should take
a look at this.

30:06.934 --> 30:09.769
Have you figured out
what he was doing?

30:09.854 --> 30:11.988
We won't know exactly until
we get this back to the lab,

30:12.055 --> 30:15.024
but my guess is
Olivia was right.

30:15.075 --> 30:16.392
About what?

30:16.460 --> 30:20.113
Seems he was making some kind
of age-regression serum.

30:24.702 --> 30:26.736
<i>He was extracting hormones
from the kids</i>

30:26.804 --> 30:28.237
<i>and giving them
to himself.</i>

30:28.289 --> 30:29.572
<i>So your son was right.</i>

30:29.640 --> 30:31.941
There was a young
and an old suspect.

30:32.009 --> 30:34.644
<i>It's just they were
the same man.</i>

30:34.712 --> 30:37.380
This guy worked in sanitation.

30:37.431 --> 30:40.917
How'd he figure out
how to do all this?

30:40.968 --> 30:43.887
All right,
let's bag and tag it.

30:46.473 --> 30:48.341
I won't forget
what you did here.

30:54.114 --> 30:55.315
Hey.

30:55.399 --> 30:56.532
When you're done here,

30:56.600 --> 30:58.100
you want to join me
and Charlie for a beer?

30:58.152 --> 30:59.485
We get a lot of bad days.

30:59.570 --> 31:01.070
We got to celebrate
the good ones.

31:01.121 --> 31:03.840
No, thanks.

31:03.908 --> 31:06.576
I'm going home.

31:13.384 --> 31:14.300
Hey.

31:14.385 --> 31:15.835
You're 19 minutes late.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.921
I had one more minute,
and I was out of here.

31:17.972 --> 31:18.972
Wow, you really think
this thing

31:19.056 --> 31:20.173
is gonna take us
across the harbor?

31:20.257 --> 31:21.791
Don't worry about the boat.

31:21.842 --> 31:24.293
Worry about the patrols
around that island.

31:24.345 --> 31:26.930
Hey, Henry, I know
I'm asking a lot of you.

31:26.981 --> 31:28.130
If you want to back out...

31:28.182 --> 31:29.933
Come on. Let's just
get it over with, okay?

31:29.984 --> 31:32.402
You want me to cast us off?

31:32.469 --> 31:33.987
What?

31:34.071 --> 31:37.106
Do you want me to untie
the boat from the dock?

31:37.157 --> 31:40.243
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Do that. Yeah.

31:40.310 --> 31:42.645
Henry, you have done this
before, right?

31:42.696 --> 31:44.647
<i>Want to know the truth?
Yeah.</i>

31:44.698 --> 31:47.083
Water scares
the hell out of me.

31:47.150 --> 31:48.785
Look, don't worry.
My cousin ran me through

31:48.836 --> 31:50.119
everything I need to know.

31:50.170 --> 31:51.271
<i>We'll be fine.</i>

31:51.338 --> 31:54.457
<i>Just do that...
that casting thing.</i>

31:54.508 --> 31:57.393
What's wrong?

31:57.461 --> 31:59.195
Someone had to teach you
how to do it.

31:59.263 --> 32:00.496
Yeah, so what?

32:00.547 --> 32:03.349
I told you I'm not a boater.

32:03.434 --> 32:04.434
Hey, hon.

32:04.501 --> 32:06.168
When you hear this,
give me a call.

32:06.220 --> 32:08.805
I shouldn't be here
too much longer.

32:13.811 --> 32:14.844
Hey, I just left you a message.

32:14.895 --> 32:16.312
Hey.
Uh, I think we were wrong.

32:16.363 --> 32:18.147
Wyatt Toomy
was not a scientist.

32:18.198 --> 32:20.283
<i>He needed someone to show him
how to make the serum.</i>

32:20.350 --> 32:21.401
Who?
Reverend Marcus.

32:21.485 --> 32:22.952
He said that he was a doctor.

32:23.020 --> 32:25.038
I think that's how he's been
healing his congregation.

32:25.122 --> 32:26.456
He's been dosing them.

32:26.523 --> 32:28.524
<i>Wyatt was working for him.
Dear God.</i>

32:28.592 --> 32:29.909
Well, Christopher
was right all along.

32:29.994 --> 32:31.327
There really were two suspects.

32:31.378 --> 32:33.296
I told reverend Marcus Chris
could I.D. The voices he heard,

32:33.363 --> 32:34.881
and now my wife
isn't picking up the phone.

32:34.965 --> 32:37.216
Okay, I'll meet you
at your house.

32:37.301 --> 32:38.968
Henry, I gotta go do something.

32:39.036 --> 32:40.503
Can you promise me
that you will wait for me?

32:40.554 --> 32:41.804
Please?

32:41.872 --> 32:43.389
Where the hell are you going?

33:13.670 --> 33:17.673
You want to play
hide-and-seek, young man?

33:17.741 --> 33:20.176
<i>I'll find you.</i>

33:20.244 --> 33:24.247
<i>God wants me to find you.</i>

33:24.314 --> 33:26.733
<i>I'm simply carrying
out his plan.</i>

33:26.800 --> 33:30.186
<i>Take comfort,
Christopher.</i>

33:30.254 --> 33:31.788
<i>You gave so much
of yourself</i>

33:31.855 --> 33:35.058
to help heal others.

33:35.109 --> 33:37.443
<i>We all have
to make sacrifices</i>

33:37.528 --> 33:40.196
<i>for the common good.</i>

33:44.201 --> 33:45.902
No! No! No! No!

33:45.953 --> 33:47.820
No!

33:49.606 --> 33:51.324
<i>No!
Hey!</i>

33:51.408 --> 33:53.442
Let go of me!

33:53.494 --> 33:55.995
Chris!

33:56.080 --> 33:58.414
Dad.

33:58.465 --> 33:59.916
You're safe, son.

33:59.967 --> 34:01.801
You're okay now.

34:29.886 --> 34:31.837
<i>Where are you?</i>

34:31.888 --> 34:33.505
It's been an hour.
What's the deal with you?

34:33.556 --> 34:35.808
<i>I'm leaving now.
Just give me 15 minutes.</i>

34:35.859 --> 34:37.559
<i>Make it fast.
I'm starting to get seasick.</i>

34:37.643 --> 34:39.812
Agent Dunham?
I thought that was you.

34:39.862 --> 34:41.947
Mrs. Clayton,
how is Max doing?

34:42.014 --> 34:43.849
<i>Doctors think you got there
just in time.</i>

34:43.900 --> 34:46.869
Now, he hasn't been able
to stop talking about you.

34:46.953 --> 34:50.121
It'd really mean a lot
if you could say hi.

34:51.791 --> 34:53.826
<i>Hey, Max, someone's here
to see you.</i>

34:53.877 --> 34:56.545
Hi.

34:58.715 --> 34:59.998
How are you feeling?

35:00.049 --> 35:01.550
Much better now.

35:01.634 --> 35:03.001
That's good.

35:03.052 --> 35:05.203
You're a real brave kid,
you know that?

35:05.255 --> 35:07.840
Well, not as brave as you.

35:07.907 --> 35:10.592
Can I ask you a question?

35:10.677 --> 35:11.910
Sure.

35:11.978 --> 35:14.012
What's FBI?

35:16.349 --> 35:19.168
FBI? Where'd you
hear that?

35:19.235 --> 35:21.236
Well, you said it
when you saved me.

35:21.321 --> 35:24.139
Remember?
You said you were FBI.

35:24.207 --> 35:27.726
Oh. FBI's just another word
for police.

35:27.777 --> 35:30.946
Well, then when I grow up,
I want to be FBI too.

35:31.014 --> 35:33.866
That'd be nice.

35:33.933 --> 35:36.702
Now, you should get some rest,
because it's late.

35:36.769 --> 35:38.537
Okay.

35:47.380 --> 35:51.133
Bye.

35:52.769 --> 35:54.636
How's your wife and son?

35:54.721 --> 35:56.421
They're gonna be fine.

35:56.473 --> 35:58.190
In fact, the doctors
are gonna take a look

35:58.257 --> 36:00.258
at the serum Wyatt Toomy
was synthesizing.

36:00.310 --> 36:01.860
It may have
some healing potential

36:01.928 --> 36:03.145
for Christopher
and the other victims.

36:03.229 --> 36:04.196
Well, that's great.

36:04.263 --> 36:05.697
Maybe some good could come
out of all this.

36:05.765 --> 36:08.333
Dunham...

36:08.401 --> 36:11.670
The FBI ceased to exist
over a decade ago...

36:14.657 --> 36:19.294
At least on this side it did.

36:19.362 --> 36:22.247
You know who you are,
don't you?

36:25.251 --> 36:26.969
What happens now?

36:32.675 --> 36:35.627
Now...

36:35.678 --> 36:37.229
I'm going home.

37:05.792 --> 37:08.460
Henry, don't worry.

37:08.511 --> 37:10.161
Just stick to the same bearings
on your way out,

37:10.213 --> 37:11.830
and you won't run
into any of their patrols.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.298
What makes you so sure?

37:13.349 --> 37:15.434
'Cause I memorized the routes
when I escaped from there.

37:18.688 --> 37:21.172
How you plan
on getting up there?

37:21.224 --> 37:23.508
<i>I'll manage.</i>

37:26.112 --> 37:28.697
Thank you...
For everything.

37:28.781 --> 37:30.282
Hey, I just borrowed a boat.

37:30.349 --> 37:31.533
No.

37:31.618 --> 37:33.619
You believed in me.

37:35.989 --> 37:37.623
You got me all the way
the hell out here.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.992
You might as well tell me...
where is it you're from?

37:40.043 --> 37:42.127
I'm from a parallel universe.

37:56.593 --> 37:58.594
<i>Copy that.</i>

38:46.793 --> 38:48.610
Yes.

38:48.695 --> 38:50.729
<i>Sir, there's been
a security breach.</i>

38:50.780 --> 38:53.198
<i>Someone's accessed the lab
on Liberty Island.</i>

40:07.140 --> 40:08.974
Ma'am, what are you...

40:09.025 --> 40:11.143
we're... we're closed.

40:13.279 --> 40:15.947
I'm sorry.
I was just, uh...

40:16.015 --> 40:18.417
Would you be able
to let me out?

40:20.987 --> 40:23.321
No, no.

40:23.372 --> 40:25.991
Please,
this can't be happening.

40:26.042 --> 40:26.992
<i>Don't hurt me.</i>

40:27.043 --> 40:28.160
I'm not gonna hurt you.

40:28.211 --> 40:29.828
I need you to listen
very carefully.

40:29.879 --> 40:31.963
What I'm gonna say
is gonna sound insane,

40:32.031 --> 40:33.865
but I need you to do
something for me.

40:38.704 --> 40:41.056
No! No! No!

40:43.893 --> 40:47.345
Please.
Please, I don't belong here!

40:47.413 --> 40:49.047
Sedate her.

40:49.115 --> 40:51.900
<i>Oh, God!
Please let me go!</i>

40:57.740 --> 41:00.742
Who are you, really,
and what were you before?

41:00.827 --> 41:03.078
What did you do,
and what did you think, huh?

41:03.162 --> 41:04.913
We said,
"no questions. "

41:04.997 --> 41:09.417
You know, I can turn it
off if you want to go to sleep.

41:09.502 --> 41:11.169
I'm just resting my eyes.

41:11.237 --> 41:14.289
Right. Otherwise known
as sleeping.

41:14.373 --> 41:16.741
Oh, don't you want
to see how it ends?

41:16.793 --> 41:19.344
I've seen this movie
about 100 times.

41:21.297 --> 41:23.248
<i>You're honestly telling me
you've never seen Casablanca?</i>

41:23.299 --> 41:24.800
I've heard of it.
It's, uh...

41:24.884 --> 41:27.452
it's Ronald Reagan, right?

41:27.520 --> 41:29.304
No.

41:29.388 --> 41:31.206
It's Humphrey bogart.

41:31.274 --> 41:33.391
I was kidding.

41:33.442 --> 41:36.278
Okay, so let me guess.

41:36.362 --> 41:38.864
They, uh... they end up
running away together,

41:38.931 --> 41:41.066
and... and they live
happily ever after?

41:41.117 --> 41:42.067
Actually, no.

41:42.118 --> 41:43.601
She leaves him at the airport,

41:43.653 --> 41:46.872
and they never
see each other again.

41:48.474 --> 41:50.608
I thought you said
it was a love story.

41:50.660 --> 41:54.362
Well, aren't all the best
love stories tragedies?

41:54.430 --> 41:56.832
Only in the movies.

41:56.916 --> 41:58.950
Come on.
Let's go to sleep.

42:02.305 --> 42:05.557
Good night.
Good night.

42:15.501 --> 42:19.104
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

42:27.997 --> 42:30.065
Hello?

42:32.268 --> 42:33.835
Walter, is that you?

42:33.903 --> 42:35.637
I can hear you breathing.

42:35.705 --> 42:37.655
<i>Is this Peter Bishop?</i>

42:40.276 --> 42:41.793
Yes.

42:41.844 --> 42:43.612
<i>I'm calling
from New York.</i>

42:43.679 --> 42:45.230
<i>I know this is
gonna sound crazy,</i>

42:45.298 --> 42:48.934
<i>but I just saw a woman
disappear in front of my eyes.</i>

42:49.001 --> 42:50.402
Who is this?

42:50.469 --> 42:52.003
<i>Her name was Olivia.</i>

42:52.071 --> 42:54.172
<i>She has a message for you.</i>

42:54.240 --> 42:56.341
<i>She's trapped
