01:48.218 --> 01:50.085
I love you, Mrs. Hughes.

01:50.087 --> 01:52.157
I love you, Mr. Hughes.

02:00.697 --> 02:03.535
All
right, come on.

02:37.869 --> 02:39.201
Hello, neighbor.

02:39.203 --> 02:40.602
We are your welcoming committee.

02:40.604 --> 02:43.107
Ooh, ah, hi, hello, come in.

02:45.743 --> 02:47.009
Oh wow.

02:47.011 --> 02:48.743
I hope we're not interrupting.

02:48.745 --> 02:50.579
Oh of course we're
not interrupting.

02:50.581 --> 02:51.680
We brought cherry pie.

02:51.682 --> 02:53.281
Where can I put this for you?

02:53.283 --> 02:54.716
Oh, thank you, I'll take this.

02:54.718 --> 02:55.785
Pardon the mess.

02:55.787 --> 02:58.286
We are really just settling in.

02:58.288 --> 03:00.122
Listen, that's the
best pie you're gonna get

03:00.124 --> 03:01.356
in the Coachella valley.

03:01.358 --> 03:02.225
I believe you.

03:02.227 --> 03:04.025
Allison,
who's at the door?

03:04.027 --> 03:04.927
Neighbors.

03:04.929 --> 03:07.696
Hey, Jim, Jim Ericson.

03:07.698 --> 03:08.930
Nice to meet you.

03:08.932 --> 03:09.765
Yeah, this is my wife.

03:09.767 --> 03:10.999
Claire.

03:11.001 --> 03:12.134
You must be the
man of the house.

03:12.136 --> 03:12.934
Yeah, Mark
Hughes, Mark Hughes.

03:12.936 --> 03:14.136
Nice to meet you.

03:14.138 --> 03:16.005
Okay so Allison
and Mark Hughes, wow.

03:16.007 --> 03:17.206
What a beautiful couple.

03:17.208 --> 03:18.340
Oh.

03:18.342 --> 03:20.642
And what brings you to our
little slice of paradise?

03:20.644 --> 03:22.111
I teach at the
College of the Desert.

03:22.113 --> 03:24.613
Oh, an educated man.

03:24.615 --> 03:25.780
Yeah.

03:25.782 --> 03:26.916
And you guys have kids?

03:26.918 --> 03:27.916
Not yet.

03:27.918 --> 03:29.084
No, not yet.

03:29.086 --> 03:31.320
We're just enjoying
being married.

03:31.322 --> 03:34.155
Yeah well you enjoy
that while you're young.

03:34.157 --> 03:36.993
Wow, Jim, look at those
beautiful photographs.

03:36.995 --> 03:38.260
Wow.

03:38.262 --> 03:39.227
Actually,
Allison took those.

03:39.229 --> 03:40.762
Oh, you're so talented.

03:40.764 --> 03:42.197
Thank you.

03:42.199 --> 03:44.065
Yeah, every publication
in Chicago wanted her.

03:44.067 --> 03:45.267
Oh I don't doubt that.

03:45.269 --> 03:47.268
So Jim, what about you?

03:47.270 --> 03:48.404
What do you do?

03:48.406 --> 03:49.772
I make records.

03:49.774 --> 03:51.807
Wow, that's cool.

03:51.809 --> 03:52.607
Wow, that is neat.

03:52.609 --> 03:54.076
Yeah, we met when
he was on tour.

03:54.078 --> 03:55.378
Yeah, I was backstage.

03:55.380 --> 03:56.811
Claire was a groupie.

03:56.813 --> 03:58.680
Love at first sight.

03:58.682 --> 04:00.683
Well, you know, couples
that play together

04:00.685 --> 04:01.684
stay together, right?

04:01.686 --> 04:02.721
Mhmm.

04:04.354 --> 04:06.321
Well, it was really
great meeting you guys

04:06.323 --> 04:09.691
but I should probably
get back to unpacking.

04:09.693 --> 04:10.993
We're right next door.

04:10.995 --> 04:12.394
So don't be strangers.

04:12.396 --> 04:14.897
Sure, and thank you
so much for the pie.

04:14.899 --> 04:15.964
Oh it
was our pleasure.

04:15.966 --> 04:16.964
Bye.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.202
Bye.

04:35.018 --> 04:36.854
This pie is amazing.

04:42.225 --> 04:44.059
Oh that is delicious.

04:44.061 --> 04:44.862
Right?

04:45.996 --> 04:46.831
Here.

04:49.801 --> 04:50.799
To our new home.

04:50.801 --> 04:52.304
To our new home.

04:53.871 --> 04:54.705
Mmm.

04:59.744 --> 05:02.280
Claire and Jim,
they seem nice.

05:03.448 --> 05:05.780
I think they were
flirting with us.

05:05.782 --> 05:07.749
Really?

05:07.751 --> 05:08.583
Yeah.

05:08.585 --> 05:10.251
I think you've
had too much wine

05:10.253 --> 05:12.153
or maybe I don't know, the
desert heat's getting to you.

05:12.155 --> 05:15.057
Come on, they're just friendly.

05:15.059 --> 05:16.128
I guess so.

05:21.265 --> 05:24.199
Baby, are we gonna fit in here?

05:24.201 --> 05:25.803
I don't make pie.

05:30.907 --> 05:33.441
You crave excitement
and adventure.

05:33.443 --> 05:37.213
It's one of the main
reasons why I love you.

05:37.215 --> 05:38.816
Give it a chance.

05:40.785 --> 05:41.783
Nobody knows us.

05:41.785 --> 05:44.256
We can be anything we want here.

05:46.958 --> 05:50.128
Welcome to Introduction
to Philosophy.

05:51.796 --> 05:53.963
Now I know that this is a
general requirement, right

05:53.965 --> 05:55.864
and a lot of you probably
think it's not important.

05:55.866 --> 05:57.967
But I would argue with
you that philosophy

05:57.969 --> 06:01.035
is a relevant part
of all of our lives.

06:01.037 --> 06:02.271
Okay?

06:02.273 --> 06:03.872
So I wanna start
by asking you guys

06:03.874 --> 06:07.910
does anyone know any
popular philosophy quotes?

06:07.912 --> 06:08.811
Yeah.

06:08.813 --> 06:11.547
I think, therefore I am.

06:11.549 --> 06:13.314
Descartes, good.

06:13.316 --> 06:14.316
That's good.

06:14.318 --> 06:15.785
Anybody else?

06:15.787 --> 06:18.521
Um, we are
what we repeatedly do.

06:18.523 --> 06:20.889
Aristotle, I
love it, I love it.

06:20.891 --> 06:22.357
Yeah.

06:22.359 --> 06:25.896
We must act out passion
before we can feel it.

06:27.999 --> 06:28.997
Sartre.

06:28.999 --> 06:30.167
Thank you, uh,

06:31.501 --> 06:32.835
Jennifer.

06:32.837 --> 06:33.772
Jennifer.

06:34.438 --> 06:36.172
Thank you, that was great.

06:36.174 --> 06:37.275
Anybody else?

06:40.244 --> 06:42.811
Your portfolio is fantastic.

06:42.813 --> 06:44.547
Oh, thank you.

06:44.549 --> 06:46.549
Wow, why did
you leave Chicago?

06:46.551 --> 06:49.884
Palm Springs doesn't offer
nearly as many opportunities.

06:49.886 --> 06:51.920
I moved for my
husband actually.

06:51.922 --> 06:54.023
The things we do for love.

06:54.025 --> 06:55.223
Yes.

06:55.225 --> 06:56.559
But I really do think
that this will be

06:56.561 --> 06:58.960
a wonderful change
of scenery for me.

06:58.962 --> 07:00.129
For us.

07:00.131 --> 07:02.230
Well there may be
some freelance work

07:02.232 --> 07:04.165
in another three months or so.

07:04.167 --> 07:07.268
And I will keep
your resume on file.

07:07.270 --> 07:08.504
Three months.

07:08.506 --> 07:10.973
Okay, I will be sure to
give you a call then.

07:10.975 --> 07:11.809
Do.

07:20.383 --> 07:23.419
I'm ready to call it a night.

07:23.421 --> 07:25.220
Do you care to join me?

07:25.222 --> 07:27.489
I'm gonna do some
more unpacking.

07:27.491 --> 07:29.027
I'll be in soon.

07:29.960 --> 07:31.460
I can help.

07:31.462 --> 07:33.095
You've had such a long day.

07:33.097 --> 07:35.333
I won't be long, I promise.

07:37.367 --> 07:40.004
I'm gonna hold you to that.

10:09.753 --> 10:13.255
Morals do change
and adapt over time.

10:13.257 --> 10:17.092
Changing from social
group to social group.

10:17.094 --> 10:20.029
Kierkegaard said the most
common form of despair

10:20.031 --> 10:22.100
is not being who you are.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.733
Right, so sometimes you're
going to have to choose.

10:25.735 --> 10:27.402
Are you gonna follow the crowd

10:27.404 --> 10:30.271
or are you gonna follow society?

10:30.273 --> 10:33.445
Or are you gonna
choose your own path?

10:35.178 --> 10:37.813
Well, that's all the
time we have for today.

10:37.815 --> 10:40.181
But I want you guys
to ponder who you are

10:40.183 --> 10:42.150
and who you wanna
be and be prepared

10:42.152 --> 10:44.652
to discuss it on
Monday, all right?

10:44.654 --> 10:46.256
Have a good weekend.

11:09.779 --> 11:12.580
And the old man says, I
can't find my house, right?

11:12.582 --> 11:14.516
The whole faculty laughs
and it was really,

11:14.518 --> 11:16.184
it was really great.

11:16.186 --> 11:20.488
Well I told you that joke
lands every single time.

11:20.490 --> 11:22.857
You know, I think you're
really gonna like the Carters.

11:22.859 --> 11:26.464
I'm just so happy to
be out of the house.

11:28.699 --> 11:31.467
Howard golfs
nearly every weekend.

11:31.469 --> 11:33.202
Every other Saturday, I golf

11:33.204 --> 11:34.636
for some of the other faculty.

11:34.638 --> 11:36.237
You should join us, Mark.

11:36.239 --> 11:39.174
I'm not actually
much of a golfer.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.345
Neither are we.

11:44.148 --> 11:46.147
You have
children, Allison?

11:46.149 --> 11:50.251
No, we are focusing on
our careers right now.

11:50.253 --> 11:53.191
You're not
getting any younger.

11:57.795 --> 11:59.328
That was so boring.

11:59.330 --> 12:01.829
I could have fallen asleep.

12:01.831 --> 12:04.132
Oh, come on, they
weren't that bad.

12:05.469 --> 12:09.641
okay, yeah,
they were kinda that bad.

12:11.407 --> 12:16.377
Why does every conversation
lead to the talk of children?

12:16.379 --> 12:20.181
Like that's the only
key to happiness.

12:20.183 --> 12:23.684
Because that's
just what couples do.

12:23.686 --> 12:26.323
But we have a different plan.

12:27.324 --> 12:30.726
You're still okay
with waiting, right?

12:30.728 --> 12:31.830
Absolutely.

12:41.338 --> 12:44.309
Mm, baby, I got an
early day tomorrow.

12:47.510 --> 12:48.676
Okay.

12:48.678 --> 12:49.513
Of course.

13:03.694 --> 13:04.529
Allison.

13:07.330 --> 13:09.167
Did you wanna join us?

13:33.489 --> 13:34.325
Hey.

13:35.893 --> 13:37.461
Be home after work.

15:08.351 --> 15:09.285
Hi.

15:09.287 --> 15:10.785
Did I catch
you at a bad time?

15:10.787 --> 15:12.753
Oh, no, no, not at all.

15:12.755 --> 15:14.455
How are you, nice to see you.

15:14.457 --> 15:15.957
I'm good.

15:15.959 --> 15:16.992
How are you settling in?

15:16.994 --> 15:18.296
Good, good.

15:19.495 --> 15:21.496
I'm not, it's fine.

15:21.498 --> 15:23.397
Honestly it's just with
Mark gone all the time

15:23.399 --> 15:24.866
I'm very lonely.

15:24.868 --> 15:29.371
So I've been looking
online for jobs and stuff.

15:29.373 --> 15:32.040
Is it always so hot here?

15:32.042 --> 15:34.775
Oh, it is the desert, honey.

15:34.777 --> 15:35.613
Yeah.

15:37.513 --> 15:38.679
Anyway, Mark and I, we just,

15:38.681 --> 15:39.948
we haven't really had a chance

15:39.950 --> 15:41.916
God, you sound so frustrated.

15:41.918 --> 15:45.087
You know, Palm Springs just
hasn't been the fresh start

15:45.089 --> 15:47.088
I was hoping for.

15:47.090 --> 15:48.689
Why don't you get dressed?

15:48.691 --> 15:50.358
Let me show you around town.

15:50.360 --> 15:53.027
Oh, no, I have so much to do.

15:53.029 --> 15:55.396
I know, but you should
really come with me first.

15:55.398 --> 15:58.099
Come on, you can
play hooky with me.

15:58.101 --> 15:58.934
Really.

15:58.936 --> 15:59.767
Okay, all right, okay.

15:59.769 --> 16:00.602
It'll be fun.

16:00.604 --> 16:01.439
Okay.

16:05.408 --> 16:07.476
You and Jim lead such
a glamorous life.

16:07.478 --> 16:09.678
I just imagine you've
seen and done it all.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.414
Ah, not everything.

16:12.416 --> 16:14.549
More than me, for sure.

16:14.551 --> 16:18.120
Well then you gotta stop
watching and live a little.

16:18.122 --> 16:20.458
Oh, that's so gonna be mine.

16:26.529 --> 16:28.429
Good afternoon, ladies.

16:28.431 --> 16:30.399
My name is Josh,
how may I help you?

16:30.401 --> 16:31.732
Hi Josh.

16:31.734 --> 16:33.434
Would love to see that
dress in the window.

16:33.436 --> 16:34.438
Of course.

16:35.471 --> 16:37.038
Where is Nick today?

16:37.040 --> 16:38.973
Shopping for inventory in L.A.

16:38.975 --> 16:40.842
Are you a friend?

16:40.844 --> 16:42.780
Oh, you can say that.

16:45.449 --> 16:46.484
Oh wow.

16:47.683 --> 16:49.918
This would be amazing on you.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.486
Where would I wear that?

16:51.488 --> 16:54.455
Hey, this is living a little.

16:54.457 --> 16:55.625
Go try it out.

17:02.166 --> 17:03.732
Let me guess, you are a two.

17:03.734 --> 17:05.500
Ah, love you already.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.537
Got one in the back.

17:10.138 --> 17:11.638
Let me know if I can
be of any assistance.

17:11.641 --> 17:14.643
No, I think I pretty
much got it from here.

17:14.645 --> 17:15.876
Claire.

17:15.877 --> 17:17.479
Did you wanna try
your dress on first?

17:17.481 --> 17:20.848
Sit down, why don't
you hold that for me.

17:20.849 --> 17:21.785
Ah, sure.

17:26.455 --> 17:27.925
Ooh, god it's hot.

17:29.792 --> 17:30.628
Yeah.

17:40.937 --> 17:43.940
Do you
like what you see?

17:45.074 --> 17:48.542
You are very attractive, yeah.

17:48.544 --> 17:49.711
Thank you.

17:49.713 --> 17:50.615
Oh, sure.

18:04.261 --> 18:06.097
Would you zip me up?

18:13.503 --> 18:14.605
There you go.

18:20.244 --> 18:22.676
What do you think?

18:22.678 --> 18:24.881
I mean you look incredible.

18:26.550 --> 18:28.519
Sold, let's take it off.

18:30.954 --> 18:31.786
Thank you.

18:31.788 --> 18:32.854
You're welcome.

18:32.856 --> 18:35.092
All right, my new friend.

18:36.959 --> 18:38.895
I think it's your turn.

18:40.696 --> 18:42.699
Let me get that for you.

18:52.009 --> 18:54.709
You know I saw you
the other night.

18:54.711 --> 18:55.844
Oh Claire, I'm sorry.

18:55.846 --> 18:58.146
I was gonna return
your plate and I,

18:58.148 --> 19:00.685
Did you like what you saw?

19:01.584 --> 19:03.717
Do I turn you on, Allison?

19:03.719 --> 19:04.554
Wow.

19:05.289 --> 19:07.588
Can we turn you on?

19:07.590 --> 19:09.726
Go on, tell me your fantasy.

19:10.660 --> 19:13.597
What do you want
me to do to you?

19:19.269 --> 19:22.273
How are you ladies
doing in there?

19:27.945 --> 19:28.976
Find what you wanted?

19:28.978 --> 19:29.980
Not today.

19:38.187 --> 19:39.654
Get everything?

19:39.656 --> 19:40.758
I did, yes.

19:41.625 --> 19:44.091
Thank you so much for today.

19:44.093 --> 19:45.193
Oh, it was so much fun.

19:45.195 --> 19:49.297
We should all go out for
drinks on Saturday night.

19:49.299 --> 19:51.765
All of us, like a
date with you and Jim?

19:51.767 --> 19:53.167
Yeah.

19:53.169 --> 19:54.935
You could call it
a date if you want.

19:54.937 --> 19:56.704
I'll need to ask Mark.

19:56.706 --> 19:59.773
Oh you could ask Mark but
I know what he's gonna say.

19:59.775 --> 20:01.878
What do you say, Allison?

20:03.813 --> 20:06.213
I think I'll see
you on Saturday.

20:17.894 --> 20:19.027
I'm home.

20:19.029 --> 20:20.662
In the kitchen.

20:20.664 --> 20:22.963
Hey, whoah,
what's the occasion?

20:22.965 --> 20:26.635
Oh I just wanted
to treat my man.

20:26.637 --> 20:27.935
Wow.

20:27.937 --> 20:28.839
So you did.

20:33.377 --> 20:34.675
You're in a good mood.

20:34.677 --> 20:36.110
I had a good day.

20:36.112 --> 20:37.111
Yeah?

20:37.113 --> 20:37.948
Mhmm.

20:41.017 --> 20:42.751
You found a job.

20:42.753 --> 20:45.252
Actually, I spent
the day with Claire.

20:45.254 --> 20:45.888
Oh.

20:47.157 --> 20:49.723
She treated me to a spa day.

20:49.725 --> 20:50.927
We went shopping.

20:52.094 --> 20:53.094
Well that
was nice of her.

20:53.096 --> 20:54.428
Oh, she's so sweet.

20:54.430 --> 20:56.665
Actually she invited us
out on Saturday night.

20:56.667 --> 20:59.270
I said yes, I hope that's okay.

21:00.102 --> 21:01.101
Yeah, sounds great.

21:01.103 --> 21:02.337
I mean it's gotta be more fun

21:02.339 --> 21:05.406
than an evening with
Howard and Renee.

21:05.408 --> 21:06.811
Oh, definitely.

21:13.417 --> 21:16.784
Our wives seem to be
hitting it off, huh?

21:16.786 --> 21:18.822
BFFs already.

21:20.122 --> 21:23.193
You know, Claire
wants to fuck you.

21:27.731 --> 21:28.863
She said that to you?

21:28.865 --> 21:31.736
We tell each other everything.

21:34.404 --> 21:36.407
Wow, well that is, uh.

21:37.340 --> 21:38.338
That's flattering.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.176
She is so very sexy.

21:42.745 --> 21:44.011
Yeah, I mean she is like,

21:44.013 --> 21:45.346
this is a test, right?

21:45.348 --> 21:47.182
Allison said something to you?

21:47.184 --> 21:48.418
No, no games.

21:50.887 --> 21:52.857
Do you wanna fuck my wife?

21:56.259 --> 21:59.194
You'd be okay with that?

21:59.196 --> 22:01.298
She'd make it up to me.

22:03.766 --> 22:05.735
Jim, are you and Claire,

22:06.837 --> 22:08.004
like swingers?

22:09.205 --> 22:10.437
I thought you knew, man.

22:10.439 --> 22:12.373
No, I didn't.

22:12.375 --> 22:14.811
Allison never mentioned it.

22:16.012 --> 22:20.348
Well, it's just like
dating but you're married.

22:20.350 --> 22:22.082
So you just date
other couples.

22:22.084 --> 22:23.818
Like us, tonight.

22:23.820 --> 22:25.886
Yeah, and we meet at parties

22:25.888 --> 22:28.125
or events or private clubs.

22:30.793 --> 22:32.860
And you're both okay with it?

22:32.862 --> 22:35.096
Oh we've never been better.

22:35.098 --> 22:38.799
So you're both okay with that?

22:38.801 --> 22:41.038
Never better, never better.

22:42.304 --> 22:44.271
This is crazy.

22:44.273 --> 22:45.773
Who wants to sleep
with the same person

22:45.775 --> 22:47.942
your entire life?

22:47.944 --> 22:48.779
Not me.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.346
It's not natural.

22:51.348 --> 22:52.379
Think about it.

22:52.381 --> 22:53.548
We're animals.

22:53.550 --> 22:55.386
We fuck to stay alive.

22:57.454 --> 23:00.555
And we live and
fuck, and we live,

23:00.557 --> 23:02.460
and fuck a little more.

23:05.829 --> 23:07.462
Allison would never go for it.

23:07.464 --> 23:09.867
Mark would never go for it.

23:11.301 --> 23:15.235
Oh I don't know, we all
have fantasies, Allison.

23:15.237 --> 23:17.307
She might surprise you.

23:20.109 --> 23:20.945
Listen.

23:21.811 --> 23:22.946
Happy wife.

23:25.014 --> 23:25.949
Happy life.

23:39.896 --> 23:42.931
Well here's to a night
of limitless possibilities.

23:42.933 --> 23:44.232
All right, here's to that.

23:44.234 --> 23:45.034
Cheers.

23:50.139 --> 23:52.874
How are
you feeling, Allison?

23:52.876 --> 23:54.842
I'm feeling great.

23:54.844 --> 23:56.511
Feeling great.

23:56.513 --> 23:57.912
Glad to hear it.

23:57.914 --> 23:58.546
Guys.

23:58.548 --> 23:59.379
Hey.

23:59.381 --> 24:00.214
Hi, Baby.

24:00.216 --> 24:01.118
Hi, sexy.

24:03.086 --> 24:04.853
Where's Rachel tonight?

24:04.855 --> 24:06.954
She decided to stay home.

24:06.956 --> 24:08.556
I hope we're gonna
see her this weekend.

24:08.558 --> 24:10.090
Wouldn't miss it.

24:10.092 --> 24:11.592
Hey, there's some new friends

24:11.594 --> 24:12.926
I want to introduce you to.

24:12.928 --> 24:13.560
This is Mark.

24:13.562 --> 24:14.395
Hi.

24:14.397 --> 24:15.530
Hi, nice to meet you.

24:15.532 --> 24:16.431
And this is Allison,
this is Lance.

24:16.433 --> 24:17.264
Hi.

24:17.266 --> 24:18.867
Hi.

24:18.869 --> 24:21.970
Claire sure does have
some beautiful friends.

24:21.972 --> 24:23.338
I do, don't I.

24:23.340 --> 24:24.504
Hey there's someone I'd like

24:24.506 --> 24:25.607
to introduce you to.

24:25.609 --> 24:27.608
Cool, be there in a minute.

24:27.610 --> 24:28.976
Nice to meet you all.

24:28.978 --> 24:30.043
Yeah, you too.

24:30.045 --> 24:30.979
Chow.

24:30.981 --> 24:31.946
See you in a bit.

24:31.948 --> 24:33.280
Listen babe, I'm going
to go over the studio

24:33.282 --> 24:34.915
with Lance tonight.

24:34.917 --> 24:36.984
Oh, I was really hoping
to bring our friends

24:36.986 --> 24:38.252
back to party.

24:38.254 --> 24:40.288
Do you mind if I
play without you?

24:40.290 --> 24:42.359
I was hoping you would.

24:45.028 --> 24:45.993
I love you.

24:45.995 --> 24:47.028
I love you more.

24:49.099 --> 24:50.197
You kids have a
good time tonight.

24:50.199 --> 24:51.366
Ah, thank you.

24:51.368 --> 24:54.071
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

24:56.639 --> 24:58.242
I'm a lucky girl.

25:00.476 --> 25:02.342
So I think that means
it's three of us.

25:02.344 --> 25:04.945
You guys wanna take this
show back to my place?

25:04.947 --> 25:05.946
I'm up for it.

25:05.948 --> 25:08.084
Yeah, yeah, let's go.

25:08.918 --> 25:09.954
Okay.

25:11.087 --> 25:13.655
Come on in, make
yourselves at home.

25:13.657 --> 25:15.859
I'll fix us some drinks.

25:18.494 --> 25:21.229
Is there somewhere
I can freshen up?

25:21.231 --> 25:22.629
Yes, straight down the hall

25:22.631 --> 25:25.369
right outside the
master bedroom.

25:28.003 --> 25:29.002
For you, my new friend.

25:29.004 --> 25:30.605
Thank you.

26:11.613 --> 26:12.448
Come on.

26:13.750 --> 26:16.717
You gotta have some
fantasy in there, Mark.

26:16.719 --> 26:19.555
Um, nothing out
of the ordinary.

26:20.423 --> 26:23.093
With a threesome with two women.

26:24.226 --> 26:25.259
You know, that kind of stuff.

26:25.261 --> 26:26.094
Those are great.

26:26.096 --> 26:27.127
Yeah.

26:27.129 --> 26:28.463
Foursomes are better.

26:31.266 --> 26:34.034
Hey, I think maybe
we should get going.

26:34.036 --> 26:36.604
It's getting pretty late.

26:36.606 --> 26:37.771
Well the night is young, baby.

26:37.773 --> 26:39.741
I mean aren't you having fun?

26:39.743 --> 26:40.809
Yeah, come on.

26:40.811 --> 26:45.746
We'll get to know each
other a little bit better.

26:45.748 --> 26:48.449
Oh, Claire I didn't
realize that you have kids.

26:48.451 --> 26:50.154
Yes, I have two.

26:51.454 --> 26:54.058
That's Annabelle and Britney.

26:56.792 --> 26:59.659
And they're at their
grandparents this weekend.

27:02.064 --> 27:03.731
Come here, my new friends.

27:03.733 --> 27:06.169
I know exactly what you want.

27:07.369 --> 27:10.541
You wanna see if the
grass is greener.

27:13.609 --> 27:15.108
I don't know how to do this.

27:15.110 --> 27:17.078
Oh but you do.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.113
You definitely do.

27:19.115 --> 27:23.617
'Cause you really have
your own little rhythm.

27:23.619 --> 27:27.055
I was so nervous my first time.

27:27.057 --> 27:28.525
But you, you got it.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.626
And I,

27:32.628 --> 27:35.398
I know how to make
you feel good.

27:36.599 --> 27:39.369
And I'm gonna make
sure that happens.

27:49.446 --> 27:51.244
Does this work?

27:51.246 --> 27:52.081
Oh yeah.

27:53.449 --> 27:55.817
That's actually the only
camera we allow in our house.

27:55.819 --> 27:57.784
Why is that?

27:57.786 --> 27:59.220
Oh we wouldn't want
anything to end up

27:59.222 --> 28:01.088
on the internet.

28:01.090 --> 28:02.126
Right?

28:03.626 --> 28:06.094
And a Polaroid's totally unique.

28:06.096 --> 28:08.132
It's like every experience.

28:10.867 --> 28:11.702
Let's see.

28:19.175 --> 28:20.140
May I?

28:20.142 --> 28:21.177
Sure.

28:22.411 --> 28:24.247
Such a studious man.

28:33.723 --> 28:35.792
I knew you were a dancer.

28:37.260 --> 28:38.762
You like to watch.

28:42.532 --> 28:44.598
What do you think?

28:44.600 --> 28:47.204
You ready to open Pandora's box?

28:51.573 --> 28:52.676
Yeah, yeah.

28:55.145 --> 28:58.248
Allison, can I
kiss your husband?

28:59.616 --> 29:00.451
Yeah.

31:37.372 --> 31:38.475
Oh god, oh.

31:45.915 --> 31:46.750
Wow.

31:48.717 --> 31:50.387
That was incredible.

31:54.389 --> 31:57.460
I've never seen you
like that before.

31:58.961 --> 32:00.731
I'm ready for more.

32:10.807 --> 32:12.973
You look so beautiful.

32:12.975 --> 32:15.842
I love you so
much, Mr. Hughes.

32:15.844 --> 32:18.681
I love you so
much, Mrs. Hughes.

32:25.620 --> 32:26.622
I'll get it.

32:32.361 --> 32:33.397
Thanks.

32:34.363 --> 32:35.562
What's that?

32:35.564 --> 32:37.498
I don't know.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.535
Here.

32:42.671 --> 32:43.904
It's from Claire.

32:43.906 --> 32:46.009
Open it, open it, open it.

32:46.876 --> 32:47.711
Oh.

32:49.011 --> 32:49.846
Oh my.

32:51.513 --> 32:52.349
Wow.

32:53.416 --> 32:55.585
I won't be needing this.

33:10.933 --> 33:11.935
You ready?

33:37.426 --> 33:40.563
Welcome to the Palm
Springs lifestyle.

33:42.432 --> 33:43.563
You look ravishing.

33:43.565 --> 33:44.799
Thank you so
much for the dress.

33:44.801 --> 33:45.765
I just love it.

33:45.767 --> 33:46.901
Oh I love it too.

33:46.903 --> 33:48.168
You are a lucky man.

33:48.170 --> 33:49.773
Trust me, I know.

33:51.006 --> 33:54.642
Time to leave the
vanilla world behind.

33:54.644 --> 33:55.909
Hi everyone, come in.

33:55.911 --> 33:58.445
Come meet my new friends.

33:58.447 --> 34:00.013
This is Allison and Mark.

34:00.015 --> 34:01.014
Micheal.

34:01.016 --> 34:02.015
Hi, pleasure.

34:02.017 --> 34:04.518
Hi, where did Claire find you?

34:04.520 --> 34:06.787
Oh, she's
literally the girl next door.

34:06.789 --> 34:08.888
So how
long have you guys been

34:08.889 --> 34:09.956
in the lifestle?

34:09.958 --> 34:11.090
What lifestyle?

34:11.092 --> 34:12.225
Oh they're newbies.

34:12.226 --> 34:13.527
Come my dear.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.563
So good to see you.

34:15.565 --> 34:16.996
I'm Emily.

34:16.998 --> 34:18.132
Mark, nice to meet you.

34:18.134 --> 34:19.567
Thatcher.

34:19.569 --> 34:20.567
Thatcher, great name.

34:20.569 --> 34:22.837
Love newbies.

34:22.839 --> 34:24.904
And of course you
remember my husband Jim.

34:24.906 --> 34:27.241
Yes, who could forget
Mark and Allison?

34:27.243 --> 34:28.541
Kids having a good time?

34:28.543 --> 34:29.742
Oh, it's wonderful.

34:29.744 --> 34:30.911
They're so friendly.

34:30.913 --> 34:32.579
Yeah, well you
wait till later.

34:34.116 --> 34:35.648
Your nametags will be helpful.

34:35.650 --> 34:37.550
Oh by the end of the
night, you will remember

34:37.552 --> 34:38.989
who everybody is.

34:39.889 --> 34:40.887
I need a refill.

34:40.889 --> 34:41.889
Would you like some drinks?

34:41.891 --> 34:42.889
Oh we're good.

34:42.891 --> 34:44.123
Good?

34:44.125 --> 34:46.059
Yeah, this is not the
place to be good, Mark.

34:46.061 --> 34:48.661
You definitely need a drink.

34:48.663 --> 34:50.197
Excuse me, I would
like to steal him

34:50.199 --> 34:52.065
for a few moments if
you don't mind please.

34:52.067 --> 34:53.601
Thank you, thank you.

34:53.603 --> 34:54.601
Come, come.

34:54.603 --> 34:55.504
Come, come.

34:56.639 --> 34:58.642
Look who just arrived.

34:59.875 --> 35:00.709
Wow.

35:07.683 --> 35:10.719
You look like a
kid in a candy store.

35:12.755 --> 35:13.786
Well I gotta admit.

35:13.788 --> 35:16.525
I'm a bit out of
my element here.

35:17.927 --> 35:19.994
Well listen, I'ma give
you a piece of free advice.

35:19.996 --> 35:23.963
Just act like you've
been here before.

35:23.965 --> 35:26.636
Everything's gonna be just fine.

35:27.869 --> 35:29.069
I'm so glad you made it.

35:29.071 --> 35:30.904
Oh thank you so
much for inviting us.

35:30.906 --> 35:34.108
We really did have such a
great time the other night.

35:34.110 --> 35:35.543
Well have you seen
anybody that you'd like

35:35.545 --> 35:37.011
to get to know better?

35:37.013 --> 35:37.848
Ah.

35:40.782 --> 35:43.250
Oh, the
rock star, yeah.

35:43.252 --> 35:44.784
I mean look at him.

35:44.786 --> 35:47.121
I just, I don't
know that I could.

35:47.123 --> 35:49.088
Oh, I've done more than look.

35:49.090 --> 35:51.161
And you should go for it.

35:52.127 --> 35:54.561
I don't know, I don't know.

35:54.563 --> 35:55.663
What do you mean
you don't know?

35:55.665 --> 35:57.898
This is what you came for.

35:57.900 --> 36:00.934
I know, I'm just a
little worried about Mark.

36:00.936 --> 36:03.203
Oh I think if he
sets some ground rules,

36:03.205 --> 36:04.808
you should be fine.

36:07.677 --> 36:08.543
Oh come on, honey.

36:08.545 --> 36:09.610
What did you think
was gonna happen?

36:09.612 --> 36:12.079
You're at a sex party.

36:12.081 --> 36:16.016
I think we just thought
we would see how it goes.

36:16.018 --> 36:19.052
Oh, that's asking for trouble.

36:19.054 --> 36:20.320
The only way the lifestyle works

36:20.322 --> 36:22.155
is you both have to
be open and honest.

36:22.157 --> 36:23.857
You have to talk to your
partner, set some ground rules

36:23.859 --> 36:25.224
and then you stick to them.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.626
And then once that's in place,

36:26.628 --> 36:30.163
women are totally
in charge here.

36:30.165 --> 36:33.701
Whatever you see that
you want is yours.

36:33.703 --> 36:37.607
Welcome to the 17th
annual Palm Swings weekend!

36:39.976 --> 36:42.909
Though I probably need no
introduction at this point,

36:42.911 --> 36:45.779
I am Miss Cherry
Bomb, your mistress

36:45.781 --> 36:47.780
for the weekend's festivities.

36:49.351 --> 36:50.351
Yeah, Cherry Bomb!

36:50.353 --> 36:54.154
Now now, Walter, keep
it in your pants, baby.

36:54.156 --> 36:55.389
The man himself!

36:55.391 --> 36:58.826
You all remember
Mr. Cherry Bomb?

36:58.828 --> 36:59.829
Thank you.

37:01.029 --> 37:02.663
All right, back to business.

37:02.665 --> 37:05.264
A few guidelines for our
weekend's debauchery.

37:05.266 --> 37:08.768
Open and close
swinging are fair game.

37:08.770 --> 37:11.005
If you wanna watch, watch.

37:11.007 --> 37:15.177
And please remember, foreplay
is greatly appreciated.

37:18.047 --> 37:19.679
But,

37:19.681 --> 37:20.514
Should we be taking notes?

37:20.516 --> 37:23.282
We should set
some ground rules.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.386
We'll decide what we're
both comfortable doing

37:25.388 --> 37:26.920
or not doing.

37:26.922 --> 37:28.188
Oh, what's the fun in that?

37:28.190 --> 37:30.690
Our key event is
a full swap event

37:30.692 --> 37:31.860
so no softies.

37:33.696 --> 37:34.663
Anything goes.

37:36.398 --> 37:39.069
If you put your key in the bowl,

37:40.302 --> 37:41.835
you best be ready to play.

37:44.773 --> 37:48.208
DJ Miss Swing, let's
get this party jumping.

37:51.714 --> 37:54.181
Party's started!

37:54.183 --> 37:55.449
I'm just, I'm not really sure

37:55.451 --> 37:58.451
how I feel about this
whole key swap thing.

37:58.453 --> 38:00.054
Well you know, we're here to
fulfill our sexual fantasies

38:00.056 --> 38:01.858
and desires, right?

38:02.824 --> 38:04.891
I actually think this
is gonna be good for us.

38:04.893 --> 38:08.829
It's gonna make us
stronger as a couple.

38:08.831 --> 38:12.199
Hey, we're still
gonna be us tomorrow.

38:12.201 --> 38:15.735
So we can just do
anything we want?

38:15.737 --> 38:16.772
No rules?

38:18.373 --> 38:20.306
I trust you.

38:20.308 --> 38:24.680
Okay, put your keys in
my bowl, you sexy people.

38:27.949 --> 38:29.782
Mmm.

38:29.784 --> 38:30.719
You sure?

38:31.721 --> 38:33.286
Yeah, put it in.

38:33.288 --> 38:34.887
If I had a dollar for
every time I heard that

38:34.889 --> 38:35.956
I'd be a millionaire.

38:35.958 --> 38:37.123
Oh, girl.

38:37.125 --> 38:38.958
Don't sell yourself short.

38:38.960 --> 38:40.994
You'd be at least a billionaire.

38:43.866 --> 38:47.137
But you can't play
if you don't enter.

38:49.839 --> 38:50.907
Let's play.

38:51.806 --> 38:52.841
Yes!

39:01.350 --> 39:02.750
I need to get some water.

39:02.752 --> 39:04.286
Okay, I'll be here.

39:08.991 --> 39:10.858
I don't
know about you guys,

39:10.860 --> 39:13.326
but I expect to have a
lot of fun this year.

39:13.328 --> 39:14.762
Ten times better
than last year, my friend.

39:14.764 --> 39:15.630
Cheers
to that, buddy.

39:15.632 --> 39:17.163
My man here
is going to realize

39:17.165 --> 39:18.931
what this is all about.

39:18.933 --> 39:20.202
Crazy, crazy.

39:21.402 --> 39:23.170
Hold on a second,
hold on a second.

39:23.172 --> 39:25.838
Has any one of you fucked her?

39:25.840 --> 39:27.907
Not yet, but she's on my list.

39:27.909 --> 39:29.942
I'm totally going
for it tonight, boys.

39:29.944 --> 39:31.779
You and everyone
out at the party.

39:31.781 --> 39:33.313
Look at her man,
she loves that shit.

39:33.315 --> 39:35.983
Oh, you know
how they call her?

39:35.985 --> 39:36.983
What?

39:36.985 --> 39:38.184
The three hole wonder.

39:39.455 --> 39:40.454
Yeah, I heard that.

39:40.456 --> 39:41.454
Yeah.

39:41.456 --> 39:42.956
Ayayay.

39:42.958 --> 39:43.956
What do you think, Mark?

39:43.958 --> 39:45.491
Hmm?

39:45.493 --> 39:49.829
Oh yeah I definitely like
to get to know her better.

39:49.831 --> 39:51.465
Get to know her better?

39:51.467 --> 39:52.532
You gonna take her on a date?

39:52.534 --> 39:54.937
Good luck with that, buddy.

40:01.911 --> 40:03.376
Can I buy you a drink?

40:03.378 --> 40:05.978
I just feel like dancing.

40:05.980 --> 40:08.283
I'm pretty swift on my feet.

40:11.853 --> 40:13.186
Mind if I cut in, Walter?

40:13.188 --> 40:14.922
Sure thing, Lance.

40:14.924 --> 40:15.824
No problem.

40:16.991 --> 40:17.824
Hi.

40:17.826 --> 40:18.858
Hi.

40:18.860 --> 40:19.692
I'm Allison.

40:19.694 --> 40:23.096
Yeah, Claire's
friend, I remember.

40:23.098 --> 40:26.599
Claire tells me you're a
pretty good photographer.

40:26.601 --> 40:27.601
I need somebody
to shoot pictures

40:27.603 --> 40:29.038
for my new album.

40:31.005 --> 40:33.273
You haven't even
seen my stuff.

40:33.275 --> 40:36.909
I got a pretty good
feeling about you.

40:36.911 --> 40:39.179
Get loosened up
a little bit, Mark.

40:39.181 --> 40:40.913
I'll be more than willing
to help you with that

40:40.915 --> 40:41.917
if you like.

40:44.953 --> 40:48.924
Well you know, I'm just
waiting for my moment.

40:50.226 --> 40:51.558
Well you know if you
see something you like

40:51.560 --> 40:53.360
you should just go for it.

40:53.362 --> 40:54.393
I mean you only have a weekend.

40:54.395 --> 40:56.165
Timing means nothing.

41:26.628 --> 41:29.232
Are you looking for a friend?

41:30.165 --> 41:31.163
Me?

41:31.165 --> 41:32.199
Yes, you.

41:32.201 --> 41:33.101
I'm Rachel.

41:34.036 --> 41:35.902
Oh, yeah, I'm Mark.

41:35.904 --> 41:36.538
Yep.

41:37.906 --> 41:39.973
Good old Mark Hughes.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.375
You sure about that?

41:41.377 --> 41:43.378
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

41:44.446 --> 41:48.083
You're cute.

41:58.027 --> 42:00.496
Do you wanna play with me, Mark?

42:04.967 --> 42:08.638
It's not an offer I
hand out to just anyone.

42:10.038 --> 42:11.971
Two more shots please.

42:11.973 --> 42:14.007
We are celebrating.

42:14.009 --> 42:16.043
You sure you can
handle another?

42:16.045 --> 42:18.348
Oh I can handle all you got.

42:39.701 --> 42:41.000
I've gotta take this.

42:41.002 --> 42:42.569
It's really important, sorry.

42:42.571 --> 42:43.406
Sure.

42:52.447 --> 42:54.213
I'm married.

42:54.215 --> 42:57.116
Everyone here is married.

42:57.118 --> 42:58.217
Where's your wife?

42:58.219 --> 43:00.286
We could play together.

43:00.288 --> 43:01.623
She's dancing.

43:03.659 --> 43:05.692
She shouldn't leave you
alone in a place like this.

43:05.694 --> 43:08.697
Someone might come
and scoop you up.

43:09.998 --> 43:11.431
They're pulling room keys soon.

43:11.433 --> 43:13.369
Maybe you'll get lucky.

43:27.648 --> 43:28.614
Um excuse me.

43:28.616 --> 43:29.648
I was wondering if I could dance

43:29.650 --> 43:31.317
with the hottest woman here.

43:31.319 --> 43:34.186
Yeah, let me just maybe
find Rachel for you.

43:34.188 --> 43:35.454
Oh, no, no, no.

43:35.456 --> 43:38.161
She is no competition for you.

43:41.730 --> 43:43.462
I got a job offer.

43:43.464 --> 43:44.463
You're kidding.

43:44.465 --> 43:45.398
No.

43:45.400 --> 43:46.400
Oh, that's wonderful.

43:46.402 --> 43:47.400
I know.

43:47.402 --> 43:48.601
That's wonderful.

43:48.603 --> 43:49.802
See?

43:49.804 --> 43:52.741
I told you this
was gonna work out.

44:29.243 --> 44:32.112
Everyone,
please report to the pool area.

44:32.114 --> 44:34.547
The moment you've all been
waiting for has arrived.

44:38.186 --> 44:40.589
Come on you two, let's break.

44:44.726 --> 44:47.159
In true Palm Swings fashion,

44:47.161 --> 44:49.496
the ladies will be
pulling one key at a time

44:49.498 --> 44:52.264
from the fishbowl of love.

44:52.266 --> 44:55.134
Their partners for the
evening will be the lucky man

44:55.136 --> 44:56.772
with the matching key.

44:57.873 --> 44:59.775
Ladies, claim your man.

45:05.147 --> 45:05.782
32?

45:20.261 --> 45:21.096
21.

45:28.871 --> 45:30.773
Get it, girl.

45:32.340 --> 45:34.206
23.

45:34.208 --> 45:35.574
Yeah baby, that's me.

45:35.576 --> 45:37.677
Oh, he's excited.

45:37.679 --> 45:40.349
Who's gonna be lucky to get you?

45:44.152 --> 45:44.753
30?

45:50.692 --> 45:51.527
Hi.

46:00.201 --> 46:01.201
Hey baby.

46:01.203 --> 46:02.802
How you doing?

46:02.804 --> 46:05.237
Yes, that was a starter.

46:05.239 --> 46:06.306
39.

46:06.308 --> 46:09.411
Oh, wow.

46:12.781 --> 46:13.616
Okay.

46:17.219 --> 46:19.319
Go girl.

46:19.321 --> 46:20.753
Here you go.

46:25.527 --> 46:26.596
Uh, 36, ah.

46:29.230 --> 46:31.234
Walter, you lucky dog.

46:32.833 --> 46:34.366
I may not be your type

46:34.368 --> 46:36.536
but I'll show you a good time.

46:36.538 --> 46:37.837
I promise.

46:37.839 --> 46:39.271
Oh okay.

46:39.273 --> 46:40.308
Come on.

46:58.226 --> 46:59.261
Come on.

47:09.304 --> 47:10.773
What song is this?

47:12.406 --> 47:13.909
No more talking.

47:15.344 --> 47:18.645
Why don't you slip into
something more comfortable?

47:18.647 --> 47:22.382
What's wrong with
what I'm wearing?

47:22.384 --> 47:24.786
I want tonight to be special.

47:30.659 --> 47:31.494
Oh.

47:33.761 --> 47:35.497
I like to roleplay.

47:38.266 --> 47:38.900
Okay.

47:43.404 --> 47:44.971
Don't you start without me.

47:44.973 --> 47:47.210
I wouldn't dream of it.

47:49.277 --> 47:50.712
I love my wife.

47:51.913 --> 47:53.583
I love my husband.

47:54.616 --> 47:56.715
That's why we do this together.

47:56.717 --> 47:59.654
If I didn't, I'd
go have an affair.

48:02.556 --> 48:04.657
I don't think I can do this.

48:04.659 --> 48:06.328
As bad as I want to.

48:08.029 --> 48:10.932
Is this your
first time swinging?

48:12.768 --> 48:13.603
No.

48:15.069 --> 48:16.905
I don't believe you.

48:33.487 --> 48:35.390
Why are you here, Mark?

48:37.793 --> 48:39.862
My wife wanted to come.

48:42.496 --> 48:45.764
We thought that it
would be good for us.

48:45.766 --> 48:48.067
Spice up the marriage.

48:48.069 --> 48:50.338
Is it working?

48:51.839 --> 48:53.441
I have no idea.

48:55.677 --> 48:58.344
This is my world, Mark.

48:58.346 --> 49:01.750
The lifestyle brought
me out of my shell.

49:05.721 --> 49:08.654
And I might be just some
young girl with daddy issues

49:08.656 --> 49:10.925
but I have sex on my terms.

49:13.362 --> 49:14.997
It's not for everyone.

49:15.897 --> 49:17.632
What if I'm afraid?

49:20.969 --> 49:23.436
Are you scared of me?

49:23.438 --> 49:25.340
I'm afraid of myself.

49:27.875 --> 49:30.412
You make me wanna do things.

49:33.781 --> 49:34.783
Like what?

49:39.388 --> 49:43.556
Things I could never
ask my wife to do.

49:43.558 --> 49:47.063
What do you think
she's doing right now?

49:48.996 --> 49:51.399
Probably having fun.

49:52.500 --> 49:54.099
Are you having fun?

49:54.101 --> 49:55.103
Hmm, sure.

49:57.772 --> 49:59.607
I like talking to you.

50:10.652 --> 50:12.085
Meow.

50:12.087 --> 50:13.719
Well, what do you think?

50:13.721 --> 50:15.521
You look good enough to eat.

50:15.523 --> 50:17.523
You're really perfect for this.

50:17.525 --> 50:19.458
Perfect for what exactly?

50:19.460 --> 50:21.561
The chase is half the fun.

50:21.563 --> 50:22.598
Um.

50:23.464 --> 50:24.632
This is, okay.

50:26.134 --> 50:27.636
No, okay, oh jeez.

50:30.806 --> 50:31.639
Okay.

50:37.712 --> 50:40.880
Come on, where's your
sense of adventure?

50:40.882 --> 50:42.985
You know, I'm just not.

50:48.556 --> 50:50.558
I just wanted to play.

50:53.728 --> 50:54.563
Oh god.

50:57.933 --> 50:58.567
Oh my god.

50:59.634 --> 51:02.869
Tell me what you want, Mark.

51:02.871 --> 51:05.775
I'll do everything
your wife won't.

52:01.630 --> 52:02.631
Fuck this.

52:12.940 --> 52:13.775
Hi.

52:14.775 --> 52:17.610
Do you want some company?

53:46.768 --> 53:47.802
Oh shit.

53:55.110 --> 53:56.712
Stop, stop, stop.

53:58.313 --> 53:59.148
Fuck me.

54:22.002 --> 54:23.235
Where is Mark?

54:23.237 --> 54:26.271
I haven't seen him in a while.

54:26.273 --> 54:28.407
You have a really great guy.

54:28.409 --> 54:29.612
Thank you.

54:51.833 --> 54:52.868
Hey.

54:55.703 --> 54:57.837
Have a good time?

54:57.839 --> 54:59.741
Now that I found you.

55:00.942 --> 55:02.808
Such a sweet talker.

55:02.810 --> 55:05.210
That's how I landed you.

55:05.212 --> 55:07.980
Actually I think that
was a drunken dorm night

55:07.982 --> 55:09.150
if I remember.

55:10.317 --> 55:12.888
Ah yeah, yeah,
details, details.

55:15.790 --> 55:18.224
You wanna go to our room?

55:18.226 --> 55:20.229
That sounds wonderful.

55:30.772 --> 55:31.907
Bye neighbors.

55:34.308 --> 55:35.907
Hey.

55:35.909 --> 55:37.309
Hi.

55:37.311 --> 55:40.915
Can I spend the rest
of my life with you?

55:45.753 --> 55:46.786
I love you.

55:46.788 --> 55:47.990
I love you too.

56:06.074 --> 56:08.074
You want some company?

56:08.076 --> 56:10.946
No, I'll be out in just a sec.

56:11.813 --> 56:12.848
Okay.

56:44.344 --> 56:47.348
We're done
with this, right?

56:49.083 --> 56:52.087
If
that's what you want.

56:55.556 --> 56:57.259
I love you.

56:58.560 --> 57:00.161
I know.

57:12.040 --> 57:16.043
Lance, you're just playing
to your adoring fans.

57:17.878 --> 57:20.846
You like to be
in control, don't you?

57:20.848 --> 57:22.915
So, how do you know lance?

57:22.917 --> 57:23.916
We go way back.

57:23.918 --> 57:25.183
Ah, is that right?

57:25.185 --> 57:28.119
Yeah, he is one
of the favorites.

57:29.523 --> 57:31.960
Look at you, ooh!

57:38.031 --> 57:40.099
Something about
putting yourself out there

57:40.101 --> 57:41.333
and having people respond to you

57:41.335 --> 57:43.869
in a positive manner
that's way better

57:43.871 --> 57:45.170
than any drug.

57:45.172 --> 57:47.873
Says the rock star.

57:47.875 --> 57:50.175
I prefer musician.

57:50.177 --> 57:51.878
Allison's an artist.

57:51.880 --> 57:53.515
She knows what I mean.

57:54.949 --> 57:56.248
Now there's
so much beauty everywhere

57:56.250 --> 57:58.217
and everyone I just wanna,

57:58.219 --> 58:00.353
I just wanna capture
it, you know?

58:00.355 --> 58:02.587
I feel selfish but.

58:02.589 --> 58:04.056
Artist selfish.

58:04.058 --> 58:06.360
We're all here for validation.

58:08.596 --> 58:11.230
You know I think
I'm gonna head out.

58:11.232 --> 58:12.398
Oh.

58:12.400 --> 58:14.266
Really, I was
hoping we could maybe

58:14.268 --> 58:16.302
relive our hotel night.

58:16.304 --> 58:18.436
Oh, Jim and I have rules.

58:18.438 --> 58:19.672
You know that.

58:19.674 --> 58:22.541
Give my love to your wife.

58:22.543 --> 58:24.046
You know I will.

58:26.114 --> 58:27.380
I'm so proud of you.

58:27.382 --> 58:28.383
Thank you.

58:29.350 --> 58:31.016
Great to see you do your work.

58:31.018 --> 58:31.953
Bye babe.

58:34.989 --> 58:35.624
So.

58:37.090 --> 58:39.127
Guess it's just you and me.

59:18.465 --> 59:20.333
Sorry I'm so late.

59:20.335 --> 59:22.400
Hey, how's the shoot?

59:22.402 --> 59:25.503
It was pretty good,
it was standard.

59:25.505 --> 59:28.239
Well did you get everything
you were hoping for?

59:28.241 --> 59:32.110
Yeah, I think the client
was happy with the results.

59:32.112 --> 59:33.712
Did you make all of this for me?

59:33.714 --> 59:35.483
Yeah, yeah, for us.

59:38.052 --> 59:40.753
I'm not actually hungry.

59:40.755 --> 59:43.054
And I have so many
photos to edit.

59:43.056 --> 59:45.092
I have to get started.

59:47.161 --> 59:48.159
Oh okay, all right.

59:48.161 --> 59:49.997
I'll save you a plate.

01:00:06.147 --> 01:00:08.313
I am too intelligent,
too demanding

01:00:08.315 --> 01:00:10.282
and too resourceful
for anyone to be able

01:00:10.284 --> 01:00:12.617
to take charge of me entirely.

01:00:12.619 --> 01:00:15.654
No one knows me or
loves me completely.

01:00:15.656 --> 01:00:17.225
I have only myself.

01:00:20.761 --> 01:00:22.194
Excellent, excellent choice.

01:00:22.196 --> 01:00:24.529
Sartre's lover
Simone de Beauvoir

01:00:24.531 --> 01:00:26.534
was a great philosopher.

01:00:28.201 --> 01:00:31.337
But she was also a really strong
feminist in her own right.

01:00:31.339 --> 01:00:32.737
So really great choice.

01:00:32.739 --> 01:00:33.739
Thank you Professor Hughes.

01:00:33.741 --> 01:00:34.576
Yeah.

01:00:36.677 --> 01:00:38.080
Okay, who's next?

01:00:42.784 --> 01:00:43.618
Hey.

01:00:45.353 --> 01:00:47.520
What do you say
we catch a movie?

01:00:47.522 --> 01:00:48.357
Hmm?

01:00:49.556 --> 01:00:53.125
It's been a while
since date night.

01:00:53.127 --> 01:00:56.529
Not tonight, I have
so much work to do.

01:00:56.531 --> 01:00:57.632
Next weekend?

01:01:00.134 --> 01:01:00.769
Sure.

01:01:49.717 --> 01:01:51.286
I'm going to bed.

01:02:15.275 --> 01:02:17.476
I have to take this.

01:02:17.478 --> 01:02:18.413
Mr. Hughes.

01:02:19.813 --> 01:02:20.648
Uh huh.

01:02:24.317 --> 01:02:25.219
Okay, thanks.

01:02:27.487 --> 01:02:28.756
Who was that?

01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:31.456
A student.

01:02:31.458 --> 01:02:34.395
Had a question
about an assignment.

01:02:41.168 --> 01:02:43.402
Don't forget I got my
night class tonight so

01:02:43.404 --> 01:02:45.337
I'm gonna be home late.

01:02:45.339 --> 01:02:47.342
Okay, I won't wait up.

01:03:42.563 --> 01:03:44.329
Hey.

01:03:44.331 --> 01:03:44.933
Hi.

01:03:46.299 --> 01:03:47.498
Are you ready to
see some photos?

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.936
Lay them on me.

01:03:50.404 --> 01:03:51.572
I love them.

01:03:53.373 --> 01:03:54.609
Come over here.

01:03:55.743 --> 01:03:56.578
Here.

01:03:59.846 --> 01:04:00.681
Okay.

01:04:07.355 --> 01:04:08.190
Nice.

01:04:09.322 --> 01:04:10.288
Thank you.

01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:11.258
Really nice.

01:04:14.594 --> 01:04:15.728
Don't you love this?

01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:17.395
Mhmm.

01:04:17.397 --> 01:04:20.401
What are you thinking
for the cover?

01:04:23.404 --> 01:04:24.337
Isn't it amazing?

01:04:24.339 --> 01:04:26.038
It just completely
captures your essence.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.840
Look at that light in your eyes.

01:04:28.842 --> 01:04:29.842
Hmm.

01:04:29.844 --> 01:04:30.845
Ah you're,

01:04:31.811 --> 01:04:33.348
you're talented.

01:04:35.282 --> 01:04:36.750
We should celebrate.

01:04:42.422 --> 01:04:43.721
There, there.

01:04:49.663 --> 01:04:51.832
Just go on tour with us.

01:04:53.333 --> 01:04:55.300
And do what?

01:04:55.302 --> 01:04:56.869
Be your groupie?

01:04:56.871 --> 01:04:59.708
We need a
photographer to do PR.

01:05:01.342 --> 01:05:02.373
I mean it.

01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:04.411
I don't know, Lance.

01:05:08.949 --> 01:05:09.583
Well.

01:05:11.918 --> 01:05:14.522
The job's yours if you want it.

01:05:18.092 --> 01:05:18.924
Honey, I'm home.

01:05:18.926 --> 01:05:19.761
Oh shit.

01:05:22.862 --> 01:05:24.866
What's wrong with you?

01:05:27.768 --> 01:05:29.335
Everybody decent?

01:05:29.337 --> 01:05:31.369
I brought a friend.

01:05:31.371 --> 01:05:32.471
Hey friend.

01:05:32.473 --> 01:05:33.605
This is Derrick.

01:05:33.607 --> 01:05:36.108
We were hoping
to join you two.

01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:37.342
Show him your cock.

01:05:37.344 --> 01:05:38.444
I have to go.

01:05:38.446 --> 01:05:39.480
Allison.

01:05:44.719 --> 01:05:46.719
I'm not sure what
that was all about.

01:05:46.721 --> 01:05:50.088
Babe, maybe you should
see if she's all right.

01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:50.924
Yeah.

01:05:51.859 --> 01:05:52.694
Allison.

01:06:02.402 --> 01:06:03.735
You're home late.

01:06:03.737 --> 01:06:04.571
Oh hey.

01:06:05.505 --> 01:06:06.540
You're up.

01:06:07.574 --> 01:06:12.009
Yeah, we had one of
those lengthy discussions

01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:14.014
after class tonight, so.

01:06:17.717 --> 01:06:20.422
I'm gonna take a quick shower.

01:07:41.534 --> 01:07:42.567
Allison.

01:07:42.569 --> 01:07:43.936
Hi, hi.

01:07:43.938 --> 01:07:45.640
What are you doing?

01:07:51.712 --> 01:07:55.884
You say we shake things
up, get away this weekend?

01:07:56.951 --> 01:07:58.786
I can't, my husband.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.990
Invite him, I'll be there too.

01:08:10.096 --> 01:08:11.865
Where are we going?

01:08:22.843 --> 01:08:26.577
Rachel and Lance invited
us to a weekend at a spa

01:08:26.578 --> 01:08:28.115
if you're interested.

01:08:30.718 --> 01:08:31.716
Are you still
working with them?

01:08:31.718 --> 01:08:33.216
I thought that job was over.

01:08:33.219 --> 01:08:35.586
I ran into them at a store.

01:08:35.587 --> 01:08:36.924
Do you wanna go?

01:08:38.526 --> 01:08:41.527
I thought we were
done with that.

01:08:41.529 --> 01:08:44.060
I know, I just, I don't know.

01:08:44.063 --> 01:08:45.264
I thought maybe it'd
be a nice chance

01:08:45.265 --> 01:08:46.935
for us to reconnect.

01:08:51.304 --> 01:08:53.171
I don't know, work
is really busy for me.

01:08:53.173 --> 01:08:55.009
I got exams coming up.

01:08:56.676 --> 01:08:58.810
Claire and Jim will be there.

01:08:58.812 --> 01:09:02.517
And I know you'd like
to see Rachel again.

01:09:08.187 --> 01:09:11.859
I guess it would be
good to see everybody.

01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.792
Do you really wanna go?

01:09:14.794 --> 01:09:15.629
Mhmm.

01:09:17.997 --> 01:09:20.167
A getaway would be nice.

01:09:22.569 --> 01:09:24.336
All right, yeah.

01:09:24.337 --> 01:09:25.737
Tell them we're in.

01:09:25.738 --> 01:09:26.573
Okay.

01:09:40.587 --> 01:09:41.586
Hi.

01:09:41.587 --> 01:09:42.587
Hi.

01:09:42.589 --> 01:09:43.988
Welcome to the Oasis Spa.

01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:46.756
May I offer you a
complementary vodka shot?

01:09:46.759 --> 01:09:48.095
Oh, thank you.

01:09:52.131 --> 01:09:53.165
I'm actually okay.

01:09:53.167 --> 01:09:54.636
Go ahead, yeah.

01:09:58.371 --> 01:10:01.939
We'll take your
bags to your room.

01:10:01.941 --> 01:10:04.212
The Oasis is a nude resort.

01:10:05.646 --> 01:10:06.281
Totally?

01:10:08.081 --> 01:10:10.782
In the spa and pool areas.

01:10:10.784 --> 01:10:14.254
With sexy attire
acceptable and appreciated.

01:10:15.688 --> 01:10:18.657
Well we don't have
anything to hide.

01:10:18.659 --> 01:10:20.695
Not really my style.

01:10:21.661 --> 01:10:23.697
Um, I am your style.

01:10:25.665 --> 01:10:26.301
Hello.

01:10:28.369 --> 01:10:29.203
Hey man.

01:10:33.906 --> 01:10:36.975
You don't look very
excited to be here.

01:10:36.977 --> 01:10:38.212
It's not you.

01:10:39.646 --> 01:10:40.681
Come on.

01:10:56.829 --> 01:10:57.664
Hey.

01:11:08.075 --> 01:11:10.078
Allison, where's Mark?

01:11:11.945 --> 01:11:13.114
He's around.

01:11:19.119 --> 01:11:20.918
Is that Allison and Lance?

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.722
Yeah.

01:11:22.690 --> 01:11:24.890
Everything okay?

01:11:24.892 --> 01:11:26.661
I don't think so.

01:11:27.828 --> 01:11:29.427
What do you say you
and I go find ourselves

01:11:29.429 --> 01:11:31.199
a little distraction?

01:11:32.833 --> 01:11:33.668
Let's.

01:11:46.312 --> 01:11:47.412
Hi.

01:11:47.414 --> 01:11:48.249
Oh hey.

01:11:52.785 --> 01:11:53.420
Oh shit.

01:11:55.755 --> 01:11:56.787
What do you say we
go back to our room

01:11:56.789 --> 01:11:58.155
and have some real fun?

01:11:58.157 --> 01:11:58.989
Mm, absolutely.

01:11:58.991 --> 01:12:00.762
I'm pretty tired.

01:12:01.794 --> 01:12:05.363
Forget our room,
I've got a better idea.

01:12:05.365 --> 01:12:06.367
Excellent.

01:12:44.471 --> 01:12:48.105
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I can't do this.

01:12:48.107 --> 01:12:50.775
I can't do this, I'm sorry.

01:12:50.777 --> 01:12:52.810
Mark, so what?

01:12:52.812 --> 01:12:54.412
I mean they've been
together more than we have.

01:12:54.414 --> 01:12:57.185
I can make you
feel just as good.

01:12:59.486 --> 01:13:00.484
What do you mean
they've been together

01:13:00.486 --> 01:13:01.989
more than we have?

01:13:03.389 --> 01:13:07.094
They've seen each other
more than we have, that's it.

01:13:08.328 --> 01:13:09.161
Mark!

01:13:09.163 --> 01:13:10.164
Excuse me.

01:13:13.534 --> 01:13:14.368
Mark!

01:13:22.276 --> 01:13:24.212
Wait, wait, Mark, wait!

01:13:26.547 --> 01:13:30.314
Are you fucking
Lance behind my back?

01:13:30.316 --> 01:13:32.551
Look, you've had your fun too.

01:13:32.553 --> 01:13:35.487
You're having an affair.

01:13:35.489 --> 01:13:36.958
You lied to me.

01:13:37.924 --> 01:13:39.424
We had an agreement,
no more swinging.

01:13:39.426 --> 01:13:40.859
Do you remember that?

01:13:40.861 --> 01:13:41.863
I'm sorry.

01:13:45.499 --> 01:13:47.001
Do you love him?

01:13:47.935 --> 01:13:49.400
No.

01:13:49.402 --> 01:13:51.269
No, I'm not in love with him.

01:13:51.271 --> 01:13:52.938
I love you.

01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:55.907
That was just about sex and
it didn't mean anything.

01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:58.076
Well it meant something to me.

01:13:58.078 --> 01:14:00.248
Okay, I mean, it's over.

01:14:03.383 --> 01:14:04.852
You're right.

01:14:06.119 --> 01:14:09.320
You're right, it is
done, we're done.

01:14:09.322 --> 01:14:10.622
I hope it was worth it.

01:14:10.624 --> 01:14:11.622
What about you?

01:14:11.624 --> 01:14:14.326
What about me, what about me?

01:14:14.328 --> 01:14:15.862
Your students?

01:14:21.133 --> 01:14:23.904
You know me better than that.

01:14:37.884 --> 01:14:38.919
Shit.

01:14:54.101 --> 01:14:55.399
You just haven't
answered your phone

01:14:55.401 --> 01:14:56.935
so I thought I would make sure

01:14:56.937 --> 01:14:58.873
that you're doing okay.

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:07.311
Mark, I just feel like
if you let me explain.

01:15:07.313 --> 01:15:09.413
If you would stop and
let me explain please.

01:15:09.415 --> 01:15:10.250
Stop!

01:15:16.389 --> 01:15:18.055
No more lies.

01:15:18.057 --> 01:15:20.091
I don't wanna hear about
how sex with some other guy

01:15:20.093 --> 01:15:21.292
didn't mean anything to you

01:15:21.294 --> 01:15:24.528
or how much that you love me
or how much you don't love him.

01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:26.967
I don't wanna hear any of it.

01:15:28.936 --> 01:15:31.135
You know, we made a vow
to be with each other

01:15:31.137 --> 01:15:32.636
the rest of our lives.

01:15:32.638 --> 01:15:35.006
I think a little honesty
isn't too much to ask for.

01:15:35.008 --> 01:15:36.308
Hmm, do you?

01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:38.312
No, no, of course not.

01:15:41.447 --> 01:15:42.282
Save it.

01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:44.919
I don't care.

01:15:49.021 --> 01:15:50.991
You don't have to leave.

01:15:58.999 --> 01:16:00.265
Don't.

01:16:00.267 --> 01:16:02.169
You hurt me, Allison.

01:16:04.004 --> 01:16:06.738
And before today I didn't
think that was possible.

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:07.575
Don't.

01:16:14.047 --> 01:16:15.081
Goodbye.

01:17:03.329 --> 01:17:04.597
Can I get in?

01:17:31.223 --> 01:17:33.360
I no longer know anything.

01:17:35.262 --> 01:17:38.199
If I say she ate
my desires, I sin.

01:17:41.368 --> 01:17:43.234
But if I deliver
myself from them,

01:17:43.236 --> 01:17:45.506
if I refuse to satisfy them,

01:17:47.106 --> 01:17:49.377
the whole soul is infected.

01:17:58.185 --> 01:18:01.185
Okay, let's stop early today.

01:18:01.187 --> 01:18:02.653
Jennifer will
collect the papers.

01:18:02.655 --> 01:18:05.090
I will post grades outside
my office on Monday.

01:18:05.092 --> 01:18:08.195
Don't forget, finals
are next week.

01:18:11.664 --> 01:18:15.135
Here you go, see
you next week, Mark.

01:18:24.143 --> 01:18:25.178
Mark.

01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:28.615
Hi.

01:18:30.249 --> 01:18:34.185
I ordered your favorite
cupcakes online.

01:18:34.187 --> 01:18:37.221
That sweet little place
that we love in Hyde Park.

01:18:37.223 --> 01:18:40.226
Just like you did
when you proposed.

01:18:41.393 --> 01:18:43.293
I don't wanna
see you right now.

01:18:43.295 --> 01:18:45.896
We had these on
our first date.

01:18:45.898 --> 01:18:46.734
Remember?

01:18:48.235 --> 01:18:50.702
I thought maybe this
could be a good start

01:18:50.704 --> 01:18:53.474
to helping us
getting back to us.

01:18:54.641 --> 01:18:58.312
We're never gonna get
back to us, Allison.

01:18:59.279 --> 01:19:01.613
Where did you get that?

01:19:01.615 --> 01:19:04.215
You ruined any chance
of that happening?

01:19:04.217 --> 01:19:07.452
You need to let
me make this better.

01:19:07.454 --> 01:19:10.654
I think, I really think I
can make you understand.

01:19:10.656 --> 01:19:12.290
How?

01:19:12.292 --> 01:19:13.291
You're gonna unfuck him?

01:19:13.293 --> 01:19:14.725
You can't.

01:19:14.727 --> 01:19:18.462
You can't erase the
images I have in my brain.

01:19:18.464 --> 01:19:20.364
You can't stop me from waking
up in the middle of the night.

01:19:20.366 --> 01:19:21.201
You can't.

01:19:24.737 --> 01:19:29.110
And imagining that you're fucking
him in that exact moment,

01:19:30.276 --> 01:19:34.447
and I'm telling you a
cupcake isn't gonna fix that.

01:19:38.618 --> 01:19:39.650
This is my workplace.

01:19:39.652 --> 01:19:40.918
I don't want you here.

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.319
This is one of the
last places I have

01:19:42.321 --> 01:19:43.787
that doesn't have you
all over it, okay?

01:19:43.789 --> 01:19:46.224
So if you care about me at all

01:19:46.226 --> 01:19:48.426
then you'll respect that.

01:19:48.428 --> 01:19:49.426
I just, I thought.

01:19:49.428 --> 01:19:51.197
Well stop thinking.

01:19:54.767 --> 01:19:56.270
You need to leave.

01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:21.592
Right, my marriage
is really over.

01:20:21.594 --> 01:20:23.894
Oh, I highly doubt that.

01:20:23.896 --> 01:20:27.398
But I'm not gonna say
you wouldn't deserve it.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:31.368
I just, I don't understand
how you and Jim do this.

01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:32.369
It's just sex.

01:20:32.371 --> 01:20:34.542
Yeah, with other people.

01:20:35.741 --> 01:20:36.975
He has his fun
and I have my fun

01:20:36.977 --> 01:20:38.576
and then we come
back to each other.

01:20:38.578 --> 01:20:40.813
We come back to our family.

01:20:42.414 --> 01:20:45.416
You really do make
it look just so easy.

01:20:45.418 --> 01:20:48.685
Maybe I don't understand
the lifestyle.

01:20:48.687 --> 01:20:49.787
It wasn't always like this.

01:20:49.789 --> 01:20:51.355
We had really rough patches.

01:20:51.357 --> 01:20:53.393
We went to therapy forever.

01:20:54.561 --> 01:20:56.661
We thought about divorce.

01:20:56.663 --> 01:20:58.395
Sexually, it just,
it wasn't happening

01:20:58.397 --> 01:20:59.930
for us anymore.

01:20:59.932 --> 01:21:02.567
The lifestyle saved my marriage.

01:21:02.569 --> 01:21:03.801
But we have rules.

01:21:03.803 --> 01:21:05.603
Every couple sets
their own rules.

01:21:05.605 --> 01:21:08.275
Swinging isn't hippie free love.

01:21:09.976 --> 01:21:12.377
When feelings get involved,

01:21:12.379 --> 01:21:14.415
things just get messy.

01:21:15.581 --> 01:21:17.314
Everything really was fine.

01:21:17.316 --> 01:21:19.619
I just, I needed more passion.

01:21:20.919 --> 01:21:23.387
I needed to know
the side of myself.

01:21:23.389 --> 01:21:25.459
I just, I got carried away.

01:21:28.661 --> 01:21:30.263
I only love Mark.

01:21:32.999 --> 01:21:36.033
Then you gotta get him back.

01:21:36.035 --> 01:21:37.435
Yeah.

01:21:37.437 --> 01:21:38.903
How Claire, how?

01:21:38.905 --> 01:21:41.275
He won't even speak to me.

01:21:42.976 --> 01:21:44.641
I found there's one
solution that works

01:21:44.643 --> 01:21:47.313
for pretty much every problem.

01:21:49.949 --> 01:21:51.315
Hi.

01:21:51.317 --> 01:21:53.551
Who's ready to play?

01:22:02.861 --> 01:22:03.696
Hey.

01:22:33.759 --> 01:22:34.594
Hi.

01:22:35.995 --> 01:22:37.498
He's not coming.

01:22:39.732 --> 01:22:41.998
I'm really sorry I got
between you and your man.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.069
I thought you guys
had an understanding.

01:22:46.071 --> 01:22:48.139
It's really not your fault.

01:22:48.141 --> 01:22:50.411
Consider my tour offer.

01:22:52.044 --> 01:22:53.577
But I really, really
hope things work out

01:22:53.579 --> 01:22:56.015
between you and your husband.

01:23:09.428 --> 01:23:10.431
He's here.

01:23:15.168 --> 01:23:16.837
He brought a date.

01:23:19.606 --> 01:23:21.675
I'll take care of that.

01:23:24.576 --> 01:23:26.476
Hey, good to see you, Mark.

01:23:26.478 --> 01:23:27.478
Jim.

01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:28.479
Yeah, glad you could make it.

01:23:28.481 --> 01:23:29.479
Thank you.

01:23:29.481 --> 01:23:30.314
Who is the looker?

01:23:30.316 --> 01:23:31.748
Oh, this is my
colleague Jennifer.

01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:33.484
Yes, hello.

01:23:33.486 --> 01:23:34.484
Hi.

01:23:34.486 --> 01:23:35.485
Jim Ericson.

01:23:35.487 --> 01:23:36.421
Pleasure to meet you.

01:23:36.423 --> 01:23:38.922
Hey Jim would you take
Jennifer to the bar?

01:23:38.924 --> 01:23:41.826
Let's get you
a margarita, huh?

01:23:41.828 --> 01:23:43.094
All right yeah,
I would love that.

01:23:43.096 --> 01:23:44.095
All right.

01:23:44.097 --> 01:23:45.866
Of course you would.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:49.600
How you doing?

01:23:49.602 --> 01:23:50.537
I'm okay.

01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:52.569
Well
there's somebody here

01:23:52.571 --> 01:23:53.671
who is dying to speak to you

01:23:53.673 --> 01:23:57.542
and I don't think you can
stay mad at her forever.

01:23:57.544 --> 01:23:58.708
I don't know.

01:23:58.710 --> 01:24:00.510
I don't know, I'm
pretty sure that I can.

01:24:00.512 --> 01:24:01.746
You're a good man.

01:24:01.748 --> 01:24:03.747
She's a good woman,
you're a great couple.

01:24:03.749 --> 01:24:07.618
This could just be
a blip on the radar.

01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:09.820
Cheating isn't
just a blip, Claire.

01:24:09.822 --> 01:24:11.491
Well, it could be.

01:24:13.927 --> 01:24:16.092
Yeah, look, I, I really,

01:24:16.094 --> 01:24:17.728
I don't wanna talk to her.

01:24:17.730 --> 01:24:21.098
So we're just here to have
a good time with my friends.

01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:21.901
Okay.

01:24:30.776 --> 01:24:31.975
So you've been here before?

01:24:31.977 --> 01:24:33.944
No, no it's my first time.

01:24:33.946 --> 01:24:35.212
It's your first time?

01:24:35.214 --> 01:24:37.081
Just don't give him
a chance to run away.

01:24:37.083 --> 01:24:40.150
You have to make him listen.

01:24:40.152 --> 01:24:41.521
She's right.

01:24:46.558 --> 01:24:49.596
Mark,
Mark hey, come here!

01:24:51.498 --> 01:24:52.430
You're gonna be okay.

01:24:52.432 --> 01:24:56.600
All right, trust me,
I know these things.

01:24:56.602 --> 01:24:59.537
He loves you, we both know that.

01:24:59.539 --> 01:25:02.172
You did not tell me that
this was a swinger party.

01:25:02.174 --> 01:25:03.674
Oh I'm sorry, are you mad?

01:25:03.676 --> 01:25:06.644
No, I mean look at
this place, it's awesome.

01:25:06.646 --> 01:25:07.845
You know I can learn
more about a person

01:25:07.847 --> 01:25:11.181
from an hour of play than an
entire year of conversation.

01:25:11.183 --> 01:25:12.382
You're here.

01:25:12.384 --> 01:25:17.153
Yeah, yeah I don't think
that's what Plato had in mind.

01:25:17.155 --> 01:25:18.855
Listen, I gotta get out of here.

01:25:18.857 --> 01:25:19.924
You wanna get out of here?

01:25:19.926 --> 01:25:22.560
Um no, I'm gonna stay.

01:25:22.562 --> 01:25:23.594
I wanna stay.

01:25:23.596 --> 01:25:24.665
Is that cool?

01:25:26.031 --> 01:25:28.134
Yeah, yeah, I gotta go.

01:25:29.201 --> 01:25:30.400
You can stay.

01:25:30.402 --> 01:25:34.674
You know I'm sure everyone will
be more than accommodating.

01:25:36.642 --> 01:25:38.643
Don't leave.

01:25:38.645 --> 01:25:40.978
I don't belong here.

01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:42.680
She's pretty.

01:25:42.682 --> 01:25:44.614
We're just friends.

01:25:44.616 --> 01:25:45.616
She may be a
little young for you

01:25:45.618 --> 01:25:46.684
but I mean you're free.

01:25:46.686 --> 01:25:49.554
I can't do this right now.

01:25:49.556 --> 01:25:50.921
I miss you.

01:25:50.923 --> 01:25:52.857
Allison, please, I don't.

01:25:52.859 --> 01:25:54.292
Why did you come here?

01:25:54.294 --> 01:25:56.092
All right friends, I
think it's just too hot

01:25:56.094 --> 01:25:57.929
for all these hot
people out here.

01:25:57.931 --> 01:25:59.564
Come on in the playroom.

01:26:10.677 --> 01:26:11.645
I fucked up.

01:26:15.048 --> 01:26:16.984
I should have told you.

01:26:20.285 --> 01:26:22.221
You have to forgive me.

01:26:23.655 --> 01:26:26.323
Everything's different.

01:26:26.325 --> 01:26:27.324
You've changed.

01:26:27.326 --> 01:26:29.060
Yeah, I have changed.

01:26:29.062 --> 01:26:29.897
I have.

01:26:31.964 --> 01:26:34.966
But you are my best friend.

01:26:34.968 --> 01:26:37.204
And that will never change.

01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:40.871
I can't lose you, Mark.

01:26:40.873 --> 01:26:42.974
I don't wanna start over.

01:26:42.976 --> 01:26:44.641
I love our life.

01:26:44.643 --> 01:26:48.813
We have a beautiful life and
it is the only one that I want.

01:26:48.815 --> 01:26:51.381
What do you want me to say?

01:26:51.383 --> 01:26:54.721
I want you to give
me a second chance.

01:26:55.887 --> 01:26:58.057
What if I can't do that?

01:27:02.695 --> 01:27:05.999
Well then I will
have to deal with that.

01:27:07.767 --> 01:27:09.303
But it won't be easy.

01:27:11.204 --> 01:27:13.804
I'll never find a
better man than you.

01:27:13.806 --> 01:27:16.776
I'll never find
a better husband.

01:27:18.811 --> 01:27:20.746
A better father for my kids.

01:27:24.816 --> 01:27:26.751
I wanna start a family.

01:27:26.753 --> 01:27:28.918
And I want you to be my life.

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:31.655
And I never wanna
have an experience

01:27:31.657 --> 01:27:33.160
without you again.

01:27:36.094 --> 01:27:37.697
I don't, I can't.

01:27:49.776 --> 01:27:51.011
Put it on me.

01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:02.188
Are we okay?

01:28:03.789 --> 01:28:04.824
No.

01:28:05.792 --> 01:28:06.627
Hey.

01:28:08.194 --> 01:28:09.795
But we're gonna be.

01:28:16.703 --> 01:28:18.638
Where'd everybody go?

01:28:19.806 --> 01:28:20.874
I don't care.

01:28:22.874 --> 01:28:24.011
Let's go home.

01:28:26.044 --> 01:28:26.879
Yeah.
