00:04.338 --> 00:06.107
Okay, Dave, as a doctor,

00:06.174 --> 00:08.209
I've got
an unfair advantage
in this game

00:08.276 --> 00:09.610
because
I'm a master of medical...

00:09.677 --> 00:11.279

Dang it!

00:11.812 --> 00:13.047
(SIGHS)

00:13.114 --> 00:15.916
It's okay, Dad.
I like playing
Operation with you.

00:15.983 --> 00:18.452
I finally get to know
what victory tastes like.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.091
(SIGHS)

00:23.157 --> 00:26.060
Here we go.
Funny bone.
Gets me every time.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.728
Maybe 'cause
you don't have one.

00:27.795 --> 00:31.031
Everyone has
a funny bone, Dave.
Except Scandinavians.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.700

00:34.168 --> 00:35.936
You're hilarious, Dad.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.805
I know. (CHUCKLES)

00:39.140 --> 00:40.608
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

00:40.674 --> 00:42.576
Dad, is sex
just for making a baby?

00:42.643 --> 00:44.145
(BUZZING)

00:46.380 --> 00:48.549
Oh, sorry, buddy.
I couldn't hear you.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.184
You know,
I'm focused on the game.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.685
Is sex...
(BUZZING)

00:51.752 --> 00:54.322
(LOUDLY) Is sex
just for making a baby?

00:57.091 --> 00:59.260
Well, son,
the thing about that is,

00:59.327 --> 01:01.329
there's birds, bees...

(IMITATING SNORING)

01:08.802 --> 01:10.571
(SNORING CONTINUES)

01:14.041 --> 01:15.443
Man,
if I hadn't whipped out

01:15.509 --> 01:17.178
the old
"pretend to be asleep"
trick,

01:17.245 --> 01:19.880
there's no telling
where that conversation
would've gone. (CHUCKLES)

01:19.947 --> 01:22.683
It might've gone to you
having the sex talk
with your son.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.051
Why didn't you do it?

01:24.118 --> 01:26.554
(IMITATING SNORING)

01:26.620 --> 01:29.723
It didn't work
during couple's therapy,
and it's not working now.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.227
I just don't think Dave's
ready for that stuff.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.895
If he's old enough
to ask the questions,

01:34.962 --> 01:36.364
he's old enough
to hear the answers.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.831
Plus,
you promised you'd do it.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.234
You know I need
to work up to things!

01:40.301 --> 01:41.635
Yeah, I know.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.204
You still haven't taken down
the Christmas lights,

01:43.271 --> 01:45.206
and it's almost April.

01:45.273 --> 01:48.476
I don't let a calendar
rule my life, Allison.
I'm not a Mayan.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.680
Besides, I'm not
the only one that's shirking.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.782
You are supposed
to give Molly the sex talk.

01:54.848 --> 01:56.750
And I did.
Six years ago.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.352
Really? How'd it go?

01:58.419 --> 02:00.087
Awkward but informative.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.822
Do you want me
to give Dave the talk?

02:02.656 --> 02:03.924
Yes.
No.

02:05.259 --> 02:06.460
Fine.

02:06.527 --> 02:09.029
I'll teach the boy
about the horizontal arts.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.931
Puke.

02:10.998 --> 02:13.301
And, in the spirit of things
you said you'd do,

02:13.367 --> 02:14.968
maybe take down
the Christmas lights.

02:15.035 --> 02:17.338
Oh, and what about getting
the brakes replaced
in my car?

02:17.405 --> 02:18.872
When'd you ask me
to do that?

02:18.939 --> 02:21.242
Like, a year ago.

02:21.309 --> 02:24.545
The warning light's
been on so long,
the bulb blew out.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.180
Or did the brakes
fix themselves,

02:26.247 --> 02:28.081
like I said
might happen?

what's happening,

02:44.832 --> 02:48.168
but I know it's dorky
and forced.

02:48.236 --> 02:50.771
Besides, Taylor's mom
is taking us
to SAT prep tonight,

02:50.838 --> 02:52.740
so FYI,
I can't watch Dave.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.775
Hmm. Think you can find
a sitter?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.109
Or you could.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.679
Fine. I'll get
a babysitter...
Mmm.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.548
...and tell Dave about sex

03:00.614 --> 03:03.217
and get your
warning light fixed.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.986
It's not the
brake warning light
that's the issue.

Yeah, it'll fix itself,
like the brakes did.

a Jessica Alba mom.

03:30.511 --> 03:31.912
What are you
talking about?

03:31.979 --> 03:33.781
It seems like
some moms hit a point

03:33.847 --> 03:36.484
where they start
prioritizing comfort
over style.

03:36.550 --> 03:40.921
Symptoms include
boxy sweaters,
drawstring pants, clogs...

03:42.523 --> 03:44.258
And so, so much linen.

Come on, Mom,
I'll take you shopping.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.663
This is a cry for help.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.898

03:52.733 --> 03:54.668
Hey, I like my look.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.970

he's breaking up with me!

your beautiful face.

that's it because
I texted him,

"Is it because
you miss
my beautiful face?"

me back, "No!"

There was
an unmarked pill bottle,

a bunch of Dr. Ken's

don't worry about it.

ineffective.

No, I gave Dave
the sex talk.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.767
What? Why?

08:53.834 --> 08:55.736
(SIGHS)
He started asking me
all these questions,

08:55.803 --> 08:57.370
one after another.

I thought it was only
a few minutes,

but then I looked
at my phone, and it had
been two hours.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.077
Two hours?

09:04.144 --> 09:07.748
The sex talk
my dad gave me
lasted 25 cents.

was used up,

I mean, I'm just
a very oral person.

Take me shopping.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.408
Oh, I would, Mom,

09:35.475 --> 09:38.345
but Linen On The Edge
went out of business
six years ago.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.881
I'm serious.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.250
Taylor's mom was
a real wake-up call.

09:43.316 --> 09:46.954
Not to mention the 300
other moms I saw
at the Doobie Brothers show.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.221
Also...

09:48.288 --> 09:51.692
One of the Doobie Brothers
was wearing my scarf.

09:51.759 --> 09:54.261
Are you ready for people
to be able to tell
what gender you are

09:54.327 --> 09:55.729
from more than
20 feet away?

09:56.864 --> 09:58.365
I am.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.600
Congratulations.
The hardest part is over.

10:00.668 --> 10:03.737
Just be warned, whatever
you wear to the store
ain't coming home,

10:03.804 --> 10:06.740
so you can kiss
that sexy little burnt
pumpkin number goodbye.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.712
Hey, Mom,
just wanted you to know,

10:11.779 --> 10:13.747
I'm all up to speed
on sex stuff now.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.448
Way to not be weird
about it.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.020
Hey!
You finally did it!

10:20.087 --> 10:22.389
Yep.
What'd I do?

10:22.455 --> 10:24.024
Dave said he knows
all about sex.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.694
Oh. Right.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.128
Yep. I did it.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.763
At first...

10:29.830 --> 10:31.932
(IMITATING GEORGE BUSH)
Not gonna do it,
but I did.

10:31.999 --> 10:34.067
(CHUCKLES)
Wow. I'm so proud.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.303
Way to dad up!

10:36.369 --> 10:37.570
(CHUCKLES)

10:37.637 --> 10:38.806
(DOOR CLOSES)

10:43.276 --> 10:45.112
Dave, how did you
learn about sex?

10:45.178 --> 10:47.647
From Julie.
She lectured me
for about an hour,

10:47.715 --> 10:49.316
followed by
a spirited Q&A.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.090
I mean, why does he want
to break up with me?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.626
Look, you've only got
one option here...
(SIGHS)

10:59.693 --> 11:00.894
...a PEB.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.563
A what?
A preemptive breakup.

11:03.630 --> 11:04.832
Yeah.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.233
When you think
someone's gonna
dump you,

11:06.299 --> 11:07.634
you beat them
to the punch.
Hmm.

11:07.701 --> 11:09.436
Take control
of the narrative,
as in,

11:09.502 --> 11:11.604
"Hey, did you hear Clark
dumped that fella?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.874
"He is not
to be trifled with."

11:13.941 --> 11:18.278
That is the dumbest thing
I have ever heard!

11:18.345 --> 11:19.980
"Preemptive breakup?"

11:20.047 --> 11:21.448
What if Connor
doesn't want
to break up with you?

11:21.514 --> 11:24.351
No. He does.
I know it.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.086
I've been on
the business end
of too many

11:26.153 --> 11:27.587
"we need to talk" talks.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.691
The PEB is the way to go.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.126
Thank you, Pat.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.329
You're welcome.

11:36.396 --> 11:40.000
So, this is what
it feels like
to help people.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.268
I don't care for it.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.940
Julie, we need to talk.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.342
Will everyone
please stop
saying that?

11:53.613 --> 11:56.049
Dr. Ken, I am so sorry.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.185
I've already
packed my things.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.686
Somebody...

11:59.753 --> 12:01.421
Take good care
of Plant!

12:02.923 --> 12:04.491
Oh, no, I'm not mad.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.359
You did me a solid.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.961
I've been dreading
having that conversation
with Dave.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.296
Really?

12:09.362 --> 12:10.964
Oh, but what
about Allison?
Is she mad at me?

12:11.031 --> 12:12.199
Oh, she doesn't know.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.067
She assumed I gave Dave
the sex talk,

12:14.134 --> 12:15.668
and I did not
correct her.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.538
She hates being corrected,
and I hate being caught.
(CHUCKLES)

12:19.272 --> 12:21.108
Oh, God,
I'm so relieved!

12:21.174 --> 12:24.144
I mean, she would've
been hella pissed,
but don't worry.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.780
I would never put you
in the path
of that Mama Bear.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.549
(CELLPHONE BUZZING)
Oh.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.384
Oh. Hey, Allison.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.686
I just got a call
from Principal Michaels.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.155
Apparently,
there's an issue
with Dave

12:35.222 --> 12:37.157
talking to his
classmates about sex.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.626
Well, that was
bound to happen.
I was the same way.

12:39.692 --> 12:42.562
When I learned about sex,
I wouldn't shut up about it.
(CHUCKLES)

12:42.629 --> 12:44.297
Ask any of my
med-school friends.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.669
Okay, that's sad,
but it's not the issue.

12:49.736 --> 12:53.140
The problem is, apparently,
he's wrong about things.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.942
Like, really wrong.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.044
What did you tell him?

12:57.110 --> 12:58.778
I didn't tell Dave anything!
It was Julie!

12:58.846 --> 13:00.147
(STUTTERS)

13:09.957 --> 13:11.524
You didn't have to come
all the way here.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.260
Oh, no, I wanted to.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.328
I'm just so sorry.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.065
I, I didn't plan to talk
to Dave about sex.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.468
I even tried to distract him
with a baking soda volcano,

13:21.534 --> 13:24.337
but the eruption
led to more questions.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.442
I know how persistent
Dave can be
when he's curious.

13:29.509 --> 13:33.413
We once drove 200 miles
to the Museum of Scones.
Yeah.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.016
It's a huge racket.
They don't sell jam.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.418
You can't bring
your own.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.020
What I don't
understand is

13:40.087 --> 13:42.655
how Dave got
the information
so mixed up.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.292
Yeah, he thought
foreplay was sex
with three other people.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.626
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

13:46.693 --> 13:47.895
Wait, do you
think that?

13:49.062 --> 13:52.832
Not anymore.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.835
There were just
so many questions
coming at me...

13:55.903 --> 13:57.604
And I, I got nervous
and panicked,

13:57.670 --> 13:59.940
and I started
mixing things up
and forgetting things.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.508
It's okay.

14:01.574 --> 14:05.178
You're not the only person
that's forgotten
about foreplay.

14:05.245 --> 14:08.581
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you liked
having more time to read.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.618
Okay, thank you
for coming over.
We appreciate it.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.927
I'm just gonna make
a hard and fast rule

14:19.993 --> 14:22.930
not to talk to children
about sex from now on.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.364
Good rule.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.570
What a mess
she made!

14:30.637 --> 14:32.305
Oh, really?
So this is Julie's fault?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.007
Well, it's not mine.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.676
If you recall,
I'm the one who said Molly
should give him the talk.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.812
If you had done
your job as a parent,

14:39.879 --> 14:42.382
he never would've
needed to ask Julie.

14:42.449 --> 14:46.019
Wow, I didn't think
about it...

14:46.086 --> 14:48.688

like the Hamburglar's

my responsibility!

Hey.

15:03.703 --> 15:04.737
Hey.

15:07.474 --> 15:10.110
Did you, uh,
get my text?
(PEN TAPS)

15:10.177 --> 15:12.379
I did.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.214
Uh, so, should we
go somewhere and, uh...

15:14.281 --> 15:15.715
I'm breaking up
with you!

15:16.249 --> 15:17.684
Attaboy!

15:19.152 --> 15:22.189
I'm sorry. What?
And you know what?
It is your loss!

15:22.255 --> 15:23.656
I don't even like
Thai food,

15:23.723 --> 15:26.526
but I eat it with you
all the time!

15:26.593 --> 15:29.729
I even go so far
as to make
adorable puns about it!

15:29.796 --> 15:31.364
But you know what,
if that is not
enough for you,

15:31.431 --> 15:34.301
well, then you can
Thai me a river!

not coming here
to break up with me?

come here to break up
with you.

Aha!
The plot maintains
its exact thickness!

15:52.185 --> 15:54.121
(MOUTHING)

15:54.187 --> 15:55.788
See, I knew
you were going to,

15:55.855 --> 15:58.091
so that's why I broke up
with you, but...

15:58.158 --> 15:59.792
God, I don't want to.
I don't want to either.

15:59.859 --> 16:02.129
Then why?
I don't know!

16:02.195 --> 16:03.496
When we first
started dating,

16:03.563 --> 16:05.165
you were this
hot-blooded nurse

16:05.232 --> 16:07.334
who knew exactly
what he wanted.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.436
And now you've become
a kind of pushover

16:09.502 --> 16:11.271
who just wants to do
whatever I want to do.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.772
Yeah, but that's just...

16:12.839 --> 16:14.574
It's because
I like you so much

16:14.641 --> 16:16.976
that I'm scared
I'm gonna screw this up.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.545
You won't
if you're yourself.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.513
I'm not gonna dump you
because you hate
Thai food.

16:20.580 --> 16:21.848
I'm not a monster.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.950
In my defense,
a guy did once
break up with me

16:24.017 --> 16:26.553
because instead
of saying "cashew,"
I say, "ca-shew!"

16:28.521 --> 16:31.858
I'm just as scared
of screwing this up
as you are.

16:31.924 --> 16:34.294
We have to just
be ourselves and hope
that that's enough.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.129
God, you're more
than enough.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.230
So are you.

16:40.567 --> 16:41.768
Aww!

16:42.869 --> 16:44.571
Come on,
let's get out of here.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.607
I have a few more opinions
to fill you in on,
starting with this jacket.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.875
(CHUCKLES) Yikes.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.043
Have a good night.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.911
Don't pander to them.
Okay.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.815
Ah. Good old PEB.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.950
Works every time.
No, it doesn't.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.019
Yeah? Well,
it worked on you.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.089
Yeah.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.856
I got wind of the fact
you were gonna dump me,

17:03.923 --> 17:05.125
and I beat you
to the punch.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.294
Oh.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.828
You thought
I was gonna break up
with you?

17:08.895 --> 17:11.064
Mmm-hmm.
Interesting.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.533
Well...
You were, weren't you?

17:14.167 --> 17:15.602
Maybe.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.204
Well, you know,
it doesn't matter.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.872
Point is,
you never got closure,
so you're still intrigued.

(SCOFFS)

17:21.508 --> 17:23.210
Ha! I am not!

17:23.276 --> 17:24.444

17:24.511 --> 17:25.778
Well, you want
to go get dinner,

17:49.102 --> 17:51.938
Hey, Al, I took
the Christmas lights down.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.906
I also got
your brakes fixed.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.609
Admittedly, I may have
waited a little long
on that one.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.280
I couldn't stop
when I pulled into Arturo's,
came in kind of hot.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.882
Unrelated,
you also got a new bumper.

18:02.949 --> 18:04.617
Well, that almost
makes up

18:04.684 --> 18:06.553
for delegating our
son's sexual education

18:06.619 --> 18:08.155
to someone who thought
heavy petting

18:08.221 --> 18:12.058
was what you do
to an overweight
house cat.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.162
Well, just so you know,
there's a reason
I never gave Dave the talk.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.864
Yeah. You're terrified
of awkward conversations,

18:17.930 --> 18:22.034
which is strange
because you create them
on a daily basis.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.737
Look, the thing is,
Dave's still
my little buddy.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.306
He's just
an innocent kid,

18:26.373 --> 18:28.775
getting his butt kicked
by his dad in Operation.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.510
I know you lost.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.979
Technically, we never
finished, but that's not
what's important here.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.382
Look, once he knows
all about adult stuff,

18:35.448 --> 18:38.451
he'll eventually stop
being my little boy,

18:38.518 --> 18:40.820
and I'm just not ready
for him to grow up yet.

18:40.887 --> 18:43.356
Okay. I get that.

18:43.423 --> 18:47.126
But part of being
a parent is putting
aside your own issues

18:47.194 --> 18:49.696
and being there
for your kids
when they need you.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.264
You're right, Al.

18:51.331 --> 18:53.566
All right,
I'll give him the talk.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.368
You know,
being a parent sucks.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.670
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
It sucks so bad.

18:57.737 --> 18:58.938

19:04.211 --> 19:07.146
You're back in beige!

19:07.214 --> 19:10.650
Well, in the
20 minutes it took me
to get into that skirt,

19:10.717 --> 19:12.385
I had some time
to think.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.955
And I realized,
while I needed a change,

19:16.022 --> 19:18.791
this stuff just isn't me.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.093
I don't want my feet
to bleed on a Monday.

19:23.196 --> 19:26.399
I guess that's where
we're different.

19:26.466 --> 19:29.302
So, what are you
gonna do with all
the things we bought?

19:29.369 --> 19:31.538
I'll just return them.
Good call.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.172
(GASPS)

19:33.240 --> 19:35.342
Wait a minute!
You know what, Mom?
Hmm?

19:35.408 --> 19:37.109
What if you just gave
all that stuff to me?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.312
You'd do that for me?

19:39.379 --> 19:41.248
We're family.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.350
Well, here you go.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.253
I'm just so glad
that all worked out!

19:46.319 --> 19:48.355
Mmm, you're welcome.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.827
Dude, I think you just
got played.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.229
Uh, really?

19:56.296 --> 19:57.364
You knew?

19:57.430 --> 19:58.731
Then why did you
even give...

19:58.798 --> 20:01.133
Because she won't
always be interested

20:01.200 --> 20:03.670
in manipulating
her mother
for free clothes.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.239
Huh.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.008
I guess Dave's not
the only one
growing up too fast.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.778
We need to enjoy
these moments
while we can.

20:13.145 --> 20:15.315
You're right.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.584
Speaking of
enjoying moments...

20:17.650 --> 20:19.686
Maybe you and I
should have
the sex talk first,

20:19.752 --> 20:22.121
you know,
just to work out
any kinks.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.425
Or to work...

20:25.492 --> 20:27.226
In some kinks...
(LAUGHS)

20:27.294 --> 20:28.961
If you know
what I sayin'.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.530
I know what you sayin'.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.765
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:32.832 --> 20:34.367
Actually, can we skip
the foreplay?

20:34.434 --> 20:36.936
I just hurt my back
just doing this whole thing.
Yep.

20:42.875 --> 20:46.413
And because
these activities
take place beforehand,

20:46.479 --> 20:48.515
it's called "foreplay."

20:48.581 --> 20:49.849
Get it?
Got it.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.884
Thanks for telling me
all this stuff, Dad.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.252
You're welcome, buddy.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.322
Yeah, thank you,
Dr. Park.

20:55.388 --> 20:58.591
This has been
super informative.

20:58.658 --> 21:01.594
Like, a real eye-opener.

21:01.661 --> 21:04.697
Hey, is it okay if I call you
if I have any more questions?

21:04.764 --> 21:07.667
Any time.
I think I have
a good handle on it.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.439
Well, I've got to get
home to the cats.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.707
I've got a night
of heavy petting
ahead of me.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.146
(BOTH SIGH)
